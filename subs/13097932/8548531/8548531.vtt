00:02:51.088 --> 00:02:52.899
Home.

00:02:52.923 --> 00:02:54.109
<i>Although it'll start off</i>

3
00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:56.027
<i>with some sunshine
in the morning,</i>

4
00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:57.612
<i>you'll find cloud coming
along in the afternoon.</i>

5
00:02:57.636 --> 00:02:59.680
<i>That's all, have a lovely day.</i>

6
00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:06.538
BBC News, <i>and good day.</i>

7
00:03:06.562 --> 00:03:09.749
<i>Just 24 hours after what many
are calling Black Monday,</i>

8
00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:13.378
<i>the FTSE 100 Index lost
another 250 points,</i>

9
00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:15.547
<i>leaving businesses
and investors reeling.</i>

10
00:03:15.571 --> 00:03:18.091
Well, that's what happens
when you deregulate.

11
00:03:18.115 --> 00:03:19.968
<i>Global markets have
rallied somewhat</i>

12
00:03:19.992 --> 00:03:22.679
<i>after yesterday's losses
which saw Wall Street close</i>

13
00:03:22.703 --> 00:03:26.141
<i>- a full 508 points down.</i>
- Idiots.

14
00:03:26.165 --> 00:03:28.184
<i>Supporters and families
of Tamil migrants</i>

15
00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:31.062
<i>have gathered outside a London
refugee detention centre</i>

16
00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:33.189
<i>to protest against
the government's plan</i>

17
00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.774
<i>to deport them.</i>

18
00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:36.484
<i>We came here because

19
00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:38.320
<i>our lives are in danger.</i>

20
00:03:38.344 --> 00:03:40.739
<i>We came to keep
our children safe.</i>

21
00:03:40.763 --> 00:03:42.407
<i>A Home Office

22
00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:45.160
<i>Britain's humanitarian
record as outstanding.</i>

23
00:03:45.184 --> 00:03:46.894
<i>We'll have a report.</i>

24
00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:55.986
Hello, darling.

25
00:03:58.781 --> 00:04:00.467
I was worried this would be...

26
00:04:00.491 --> 00:04:02.326
- Huh?
- Burnt on top.

27
00:04:09.917 --> 00:04:11.144
You all right?

28
00:04:11.168 --> 00:04:13.688
- What?
- What's that?

29
00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:17.567
Well, what does it look
like? It's a button.

30
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:19.819
- A button?
- Yes.

31
00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:22.989
Somebody just, uh,
put it in the tin.

32
00:04:23.013 --> 00:04:26.660
Honestly. People.

33
00:04:26.684 --> 00:04:29.186
Well, you never know when
it may come in handy.

34
00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:32.773
Hm.

35
00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:51.875
Oh.

36
00:04:54.628 --> 00:04:56.505
Oh, hello. What
have you got now?

37
00:04:57.506 --> 00:04:59.234
Oh, it's a typewriter.

38
00:04:59.258 --> 00:05:02.237
I know what it is, but
you've already got one.

39
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:05.323
I know. It's not
for me. It's, um...

40
00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:08.118
They don't need it
anymore at the day centre,

41
00:05:08.142 --> 00:05:09.202
so I thought it
would be all right

42
00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:10.787
for the new care home.

43
00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:13.957
And, uh, we can hang on
to it in the meanwhile.

44
00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:15.375
- No.
- Huh?

45
00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:16.876
No.

46
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.296
Why? Uh, I've also
got a desk outside.

47
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.716
- What? Where?
- Well, I haven't brought it in yet but...

48
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.801
- Oh, Nicky. It's too much.
- What?

49
00:05:24.825 --> 00:05:27.345
How will we fit everyone
in at Christmas?

50
00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:28.722
I don't know.

51
00:05:28.746 --> 00:05:29.889
They'll just have to
shove up, won't they?

52
00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:31.391
Your daughter is
seven months pregnant.

53
00:05:31.415 --> 00:05:33.810
- I know.
- She cannot "shove up".

54
00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:35.270
All right.

55
00:05:35.294 --> 00:05:37.147
Well, I'll move it
all to the study then.

56
00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:38.898
Oh, the study.

57
00:05:38.922 --> 00:05:41.192
I bet you have plenty
of room in the study.

58
00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:43.218
- God.
- Let's go and check the study.

59
00:05:45.012 --> 00:05:46.597
Oh, Nicky. Out.

60
00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.868
Do you still need all this?

61
00:05:49.892 --> 00:05:52.287
Yes. Why?

62
00:05:52.311 --> 00:05:55.999
What... What's in
all these drawers?

63
00:05:56.023 --> 00:05:58.108
Well, everything
I think. Darling.

64
00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:02.738
A domino, a biscuit

65
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.177
and how many rubber
bands does one man need?

66
00:06:07.201 --> 00:06:09.787
I don't know. I've never
asked the question.

67
00:06:12.206 --> 00:06:15.602
And you've got to find
the right home for that.

68
00:06:15.626 --> 00:06:17.961
Somewhere it will
be appreciated.

69
00:06:20.756 --> 00:06:21.965
Please, Nicky,

70
00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.861
you have to let go.

71
00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:26.512
For your own sake.

72
00:07:31.285 --> 00:07:33.555
Oh, I'm so looking
forward to it.

73
00:07:33.579 --> 00:07:35.431
<i>Do you want me to stay with him?</i>

74
00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:38.560
No, no. No, he'll be fine.

75
00:07:38.584 --> 00:07:40.270
<i>Okay, well, maybe
I'll just call him.</i>

76
00:07:40.294 --> 00:07:45.048
Yes. Yes. He's a grown man.

77
00:07:48.177 --> 00:07:49.779
You don't have to wave me off.

78
00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:51.865
Of course I'm going
to wave you off.

79
00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:53.015
Everyone's here.

80
00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:54.766
Ah.

81
00:08:01.899 --> 00:08:03.066
Huh.

82
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:13.535
Hm.

83
00:08:14.036 --> 00:08:15.889
Nicky,

84
00:08:15.913 --> 00:08:17.348
don't let yourself get...

85
00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:18.474
What?

86
00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:20.560
How you get.

87
00:08:20.584 --> 00:08:23.313
I won't. Of course I won't.

88
00:08:23.337 --> 00:08:24.880
You have a wonderful time.

89
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.270
Home. Ah, Nicky.

90
00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:06.088
- You missed Martin.
- Damn.

91
00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:08.775
Two hearts. Kings.

92
00:09:08.799 --> 00:09:11.194
Uh, hello. Did Martin
say if he'd call back?

93
00:09:11.218 --> 00:09:12.904
Seven o'clock sharp.

94
00:09:12.928 --> 00:09:15.198
Oh.

95
00:09:15.222 --> 00:09:17.391
Thank you, mother.
You're very welcome, son.

96
00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:21.371
Isn't Martin the chap he was
supposed to be going skiing with?

97
00:09:21.395 --> 00:09:24.832
Yes. But Martin
is in Prague now,

98
00:09:24.856 --> 00:09:26.417
helping refugees.

99
00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:27.919
Prague?

100
00:09:27.943 --> 00:09:29.528
Well, precisely.

101
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.801
Hello? <i>It's Martin.</i>

102
00:09:34.825 --> 00:09:36.135
<i>- Can you hear me? Nicky?</i>
- I... I can hear you.

103
00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:37.679
<i>- It's a terrible line.</i>
- I can hear you.

104
00:09:37.703 --> 00:09:39.055
<i>Listen, I'm not sure
you should come.</i>

105
00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:41.224
No, it's all arranged.
I have my ticket.

106
00:09:41.248 --> 00:09:43.101
<i>I have to leave Prague tonight.</i>

107
00:09:43.125 --> 00:09:46.562
<i>I'll have a man called
Trevor Chadwick meet you.</i>

108
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:49.482
<i>I'm so sorry. It's
just such a mess here.</i>

109
00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:50.507
Happy Christmas.

110
00:09:56.555 --> 00:09:58.032
So, you going?

111
00:09:58.056 --> 00:10:00.267
I am, yes.

112
00:10:03.687 --> 00:10:06.749
Everyone in Prague
is trying to get out.

113
00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:09.043
My son is trying to get in.

114
00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:11.671
Did you speak to Martin?

115
00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:15.591
I did. Uh, turns out
he's not gonna be there.

116
00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:17.760
He's escorting some
refugees out of the country

117
00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:19.762
and then he's heading
back home to London.

118
00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:22.015
- Nicky.
- Look, I have to do something.

119
00:10:22.039 --> 00:10:23.933
It... Is...

120
00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:26.352
And you, of all people,
should understand that.

121
00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:27.687
Isn't that what you taught me?

122
00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:29.731
Well, I can't just sit
here reading about it.

123
00:10:29.755 --> 00:10:31.190
These people need help.

124
00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:34.569
I was never in doubt
that the cause was just,

125
00:10:34.593 --> 00:10:36.029
only whether Prague is safe.

126
00:10:36.053 --> 00:10:37.196
It's only a week.

127
00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.490
Uh, I'll be back before
you even miss me.

128
00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:41.784
Nicky, it's not a joke.

129
00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:43.101
I know, I know.

130
00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:45.354
I'm sorry, but I...

131
00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:48.315
I have to go.

132
00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:24.684
Here we are.

133
00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:29.582
- Mr Chadwick.
- This is Mr Winton.

134
00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:31.292
- Evening.
- Now, don't go giving him

135
00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:32.877
a better room than me.

136
00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:34.837
All our rooms are the
best rooms, Mr Chadwick.

137
00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:36.422
Rudi takes good care of us.

138
00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:40.242
Welcome. And Miss
Warriner is in the bar.

139
00:11:42.285 --> 00:11:44.847
Oh, that's Doreen

140
00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:46.706
with one of our refugees.

141
00:11:47.666 --> 00:11:49.668
Over here.

142
00:11:53.004 --> 00:11:54.315
Her husband was picked up

143
00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:55.924
on the street this morning.

144
00:11:57.467 --> 00:11:58.945
Picked up by?

145
00:11:58.969 --> 00:12:02.198
Doreen thinks Nazi spies
doing Hitler's dirty work.

146
00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:04.242
What will happen?
To him, I mean.

147
00:12:04.266 --> 00:12:07.286
Ah, thank you, thank you.

148
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:08.663
He'll be dumped somewhere.

149
00:12:08.687 --> 00:12:10.063
Maybe alive,

150
00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:12.899
but probably not.

151
00:12:14.985 --> 00:12:16.629
You're Martin's friend,
the stockbroker.

152
00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:20.633
- Nicky. And you must be, uh...
- Unbelievably angry.

153
00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:22.093
So? We've managed to get

154
00:12:22.117 --> 00:12:23.511
Monika into a safe
house for the night

155
00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:25.245
and her daughter on
the plane out tomorrow.

156
00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:28.975
Well, that's something.

157
00:12:28.999 --> 00:12:31.727
So, Martin says you know
your way around a desk.

158
00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:33.146
That's quite an accolade.

159
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:35.547
It is here.
Paperwork's everything.

160
00:12:39.217 --> 00:12:40.862
And can I just ask, um,

161
00:12:40.886 --> 00:12:43.322
why... why was that
woman's husband taken?

162
00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:45.116
He ran a newspaper in Germany.

163
00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.909
Spoke out against the Nazis.

164
00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:48.536
When it got too dangerous,

165
00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.954
they escaped over the
border into Czechoslovakia.

166
00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:51.289
- The Sudetenland.
- Where they thought

167
00:12:51.313 --> 00:12:52.665
they'd be safe.

168
00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:54.399
And so they fled to Prague.

169
00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:57.420
All right, I've got a lot to do.

170
00:12:57.444 --> 00:12:58.504
Taking supplies to
the camps tomorrow.

171
00:12:58.528 --> 00:12:59.905
I could use your help.

172
00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:07.472
Can I ask what
brought you out here?

173
00:13:07.496 --> 00:13:11.601
I came 10 years ago
for a study trip.

174
00:13:11.625 --> 00:13:15.688
I just... just love the
place, love the people.

175
00:13:15.712 --> 00:13:18.632
Now they're in trouble.
So I came back.

176
00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:30.786
Are they all from
the Sudetenland?

177
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.497
Mostly.

178
00:13:32.521 --> 00:13:37.210
Some from Austria and
Germany who fled there first.

179
00:13:37.234 --> 00:13:39.962
Drive an hour north of here,
towards the German border,

180
00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:41.380
you'll see the
towns they ran from

181
00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:42.822
hung with Nazi flags.

182
00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:53.059
Dear God.

183
00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:55.335
I know. And there are
thousands more like this.

184
00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:09.700
<i>Ahoj,</i> Hana. This
is Nicholas Winton.

185
00:14:09.724 --> 00:14:10.976
He's here to help out.

186
00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:13.496
Oh.

187
00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.790
Hana Hejdukova. Liaison
officer for Czech refugees.

188
00:14:15.814 --> 00:14:17.542
- Hello.
- Your first time

189
00:14:17.566 --> 00:14:20.836
- in Czechoslovakia?
- Yes, yes, it... Yes, it is.

190
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.464
Shame you didn't come sooner.
When there was more of it.

191
00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:24.698
Hana.

192
00:14:26.575 --> 00:14:28.928
Um, can you get the others?

193
00:14:28.952 --> 00:14:31.722
Oh, there we go.

194
00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:33.641
So, you've managed to
get doctors out to them?

195
00:14:33.665 --> 00:14:36.811
Oh, plenty of
doctors already here.

196
00:14:36.835 --> 00:14:38.854
Lots of these children grew
up thinking the worst thing

197
00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:41.256
that was ever gonna happen
to them was piano practice.

198
00:14:44.593 --> 00:14:45.594
Nicky.

199
00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:15.850
Hello.

200
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.582
I'm so... I'm sorry,

201
00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:22.857
I haven't got anything.

202
00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:25.527
Oh, wait,

203
00:16:26.444 --> 00:16:28.196
now hold on a moment.

204
00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:31.658
Chocolate.

205
00:16:33.868 --> 00:16:36.013
Here we go.

206
00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:37.598
Oh, yes,

207
00:16:37.622 --> 00:16:39.850
of course you'd
like some as well.

208
00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:42.144
There we go.

209
00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:43.646
Oh.

210
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.439
Let's see how far we go.

211
00:16:45.463 --> 00:16:47.525
Oh, crikey.

212
00:16:47.549 --> 00:16:48.859
There's only a tiny bit.

213
00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:50.653
And little bit for you.

214
00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:51.761
Little bit for you.

215
00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:54.990
That's it. That's
the last of it.

216
00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:56.891
There you go.

217
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:05.150
I'm sorry. I'll, um... I'll
bring more, another day.

218
00:17:07.986 --> 00:17:09.320
<i>Foto, foto.</i>

219
00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:14.617
Yes, yes. It's a good idea.

220
00:17:15.577 --> 00:17:17.555
What's your name?

221
00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.014
I'm Nicky.

222
00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:20.123
Can you say, "Nicky"?

223
00:17:22.292 --> 00:17:24.544
There we go.

224
00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:35.531
How will these children
survive the winter?

225
00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:37.867
Well, they probably won't.

226
00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:39.768
And there are a dozen
more places like this.

227
00:17:41.853 --> 00:17:43.914
Surely, they should
be the priority,

228
00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:45.833
the children, families.

229
00:17:45.857 --> 00:17:48.169
My remit is to rescue politicals

230
00:17:48.193 --> 00:17:50.004
at imminent risk of arrest.

231
00:17:50.028 --> 00:17:51.797
And I've hardly the money
or manpower for that.

232
00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:52.798
What about the British
government trains?

233
00:17:52.822 --> 00:17:54.467
The Kindertransport?

234
00:17:54.491 --> 00:17:56.469
It's only for children
leaving Germany and Austria.

235
00:17:56.493 --> 00:17:58.053
Not from Czechoslovakia.

236
00:17:58.077 --> 00:18:00.097
Unfortunately, His
Majesty's government refuses

237
00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:01.956
to believe these
people are in danger.

238
00:18:17.764 --> 00:18:19.366
How many children
are we talking about?

239
00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:20.785
Oh, well, we don't know.
That's part of the problem.

240
00:18:20.809 --> 00:18:24.330
Thousands. There's
refugees all over the city.

241
00:18:24.354 --> 00:18:25.873
Jewish people, especially.

242
00:18:25.897 --> 00:18:26.999
But anyone, really,
who doesn't fit

243
00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:28.334
into Hitler's master race.

244
00:18:28.358 --> 00:18:29.710
They're banned from travel

245
00:18:29.734 --> 00:18:31.378
and the UK's
refusing entry visas

246
00:18:31.402 --> 00:18:34.173
to families trying to
get out. It's chaos.

247
00:18:34.197 --> 00:18:36.008
Welcome to the British Committee

248
00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:38.135
for Refugees from
Czechoslovakia.

249
00:18:38.159 --> 00:18:40.429
Hana, get him those
files, would you?

250
00:18:40.453 --> 00:18:42.181
That's quite a filing system.

251
00:18:42.205 --> 00:18:45.184
Yes. Well, if the Germans
send in their spies,

252
00:18:45.208 --> 00:18:47.269
at least they won't be
able to find anything.

253
00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:49.104
In any case,

254
00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:50.606
you're the one who's supposed
to be good with paperwork.

255
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:51.714
This is you.

256
00:18:57.011 --> 00:18:59.406
Uh, yes, this report

257
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.534
details the political activists

258
00:19:01.558 --> 00:19:02.934
in and around Prague.

259
00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:07.957
What's this?

260
00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:11.377
The Führer's travel
plans in black and white.

261
00:19:11.401 --> 00:19:13.337
He's got his sights
set on half of Europe.

262
00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:14.863
It's just a question of when.

263
00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:17.591
Who else has seen it?

264
00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:18.825
Half of Prague, I imagine.

265
00:19:21.035 --> 00:19:23.097
Meant to intimidate.

266
00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:25.307
Hitler's never made any
secret of his ambitions.

267
00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:26.892
The allies banked
on appeasing him

268
00:19:26.916 --> 00:19:28.644
with a fat slice
of this country.

269
00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:30.788
Now the vicious shit's just
gonna take the rest of it.

270
00:19:31.629 --> 00:19:34.275
The children. We
have to move them.

271
00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:36.277
Says the man who
arrived yesterday.

272
00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:38.696
Well, I'm not suggesting
it's gonna be easy.

273
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:43.033
A mass transit of children
without money or... or visas?

274
00:19:43.057 --> 00:19:44.785
Well, we'll find a way.

275
00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:48.080
How long are you
here for? A week?

276
00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:49.373
And then you're
back to your bank.

277
00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:50.708
Can we please put
that aside for now?

278
00:19:50.732 --> 00:19:53.002
Well, can we please
be realistic?

279
00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:54.670
We can't give these
people false hope.

280
00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:59.008
Look, we... we have to believe
that this might be possible.

281
00:19:59.032 --> 00:20:00.885
Look...

282
00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:03.637
Let me try. Let... Let... Let me

283
00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:05.723
find out the scale
of the problem.

284
00:20:05.747 --> 00:20:09.852
You know, how many
children, names and ages,

285
00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:11.085
where they're living.

286
00:20:12.712 --> 00:20:14.112
There must be
existing information.

287
00:20:17.592 --> 00:20:20.738
Well, the vulnerable
groups, they do have lists.

288
00:20:20.762 --> 00:20:24.241
But, they are scared
to share them.

289
00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:27.226
Well, then, we need
to earn their trust.

290
00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:30.205
We need those lists.

291
00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:31.564
So, we have to persuade them.

292
00:20:33.483 --> 00:20:35.109
Please, let me try.

293
00:20:39.489 --> 00:20:42.509
Good afternoon. Uh,
my name is Winton.

294
00:20:42.533 --> 00:20:44.678
Nicholas Winton.

295
00:20:44.702 --> 00:20:47.014
Yes, I'm ringing from
the British Committee

296
00:20:47.038 --> 00:20:49.016
for Refugees from
Czechoslovakia.

297
00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.001
Well, I'm looking to obtain a
list of vulnerable children.

298
00:20:54.337 --> 00:20:57.149
No, I understand, but we will
have everything in place.

299
00:20:57.173 --> 00:20:58.800
Hello? Hello?

300
00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:09.143
Yes. May I at least
come and meet?

301
00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.790
Thank you for seeing me.

302
00:21:12.814 --> 00:21:14.291
How could I resist?

303
00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:16.335
You're offering to get
children out of Prague.

304
00:21:16.359 --> 00:21:17.419
A lot of them.

305
00:21:17.443 --> 00:21:19.088
That is correct.

306
00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:21.382
Hitler will be thrilled
to know you're helping him

307
00:21:21.406 --> 00:21:22.865
eradicate Jews from the region.

308
00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:30.224
With... With respect,
uh, I'm moving children

309
00:21:30.248 --> 00:21:32.977
of all faiths and none.

310
00:21:33.001 --> 00:21:34.520
Separating them
from their families,

311
00:21:34.544 --> 00:21:37.231
perhaps from their religion?

312
00:21:37.255 --> 00:21:39.984
Accommodating them
in safe homes,

313
00:21:40.008 --> 00:21:42.611
with families in foster homes.

314
00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:43.845
Jewish foster homes?

315
00:21:47.098 --> 00:21:49.326
I don't know.

316
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.412
I don't think that's
a question for now.

317
00:21:51.436 --> 00:21:54.123
But it's a question I'm asking.

318
00:21:54.147 --> 00:21:56.792
You are not the only
person at this table

319
00:21:56.816 --> 00:21:58.544
concerned about the
well-being of Jewish children.

320
00:21:58.568 --> 00:22:01.213
Parents in London are preparing

321
00:22:01.237 --> 00:22:03.173
to send their children
out of the city

322
00:22:03.197 --> 00:22:05.050
to safety in the event of a war.

323
00:22:05.074 --> 00:22:08.512
What I'm proposing
is no different.

324
00:22:08.536 --> 00:22:11.181
Your children would be protected

325
00:22:11.205 --> 00:22:14.000
and returned to their
families as soon as it's safe.

326
00:22:16.794 --> 00:22:19.213
Are you Jewish, Mr Winton?

327
00:22:22.425 --> 00:22:24.611
Why would you ask that?

328
00:22:24.635 --> 00:22:27.406
Because I wonder why a
person would undertake

329
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:30.200
this daunting task for people

330
00:22:30.224 --> 00:22:32.619
to whom he has no
real allegiance,

331
00:22:32.643 --> 00:22:35.271
in a place where
he does not belong.

332
00:22:38.524 --> 00:22:40.193
You're a stockbroker from London

333
00:22:41.527 --> 00:22:43.488
with a comfortable
life, I presume.

334
00:22:44.614 --> 00:22:46.717
You've done some research.

335
00:22:46.741 --> 00:22:50.846
It is a serious matter.
So, why are you doing this?

336
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:53.748
What I mean is, who
are you, Mr Winton?

337
00:22:54.874 --> 00:22:55.976
Well...

338
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.312
My father's family

339
00:22:58.336 --> 00:23:02.566
came from Germany to
London in the 1870s.

340
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:04.884
Till just a few months
ago, we were Wertheims.

341
00:23:06.302 --> 00:23:07.654
We went through the last war

342
00:23:07.678 --> 00:23:10.657
with a German
surname and my mother

343
00:23:10.681 --> 00:23:14.369
my mother couldn't stand
doing it again, so...

344
00:23:14.393 --> 00:23:17.814
And my grandparents on
both sides were Jewish.

345
00:23:20.108 --> 00:23:23.003
But I was baptised in
the Church of England.

346
00:23:23.027 --> 00:23:24.403
So,

347
00:23:26.072 --> 00:23:27.549
I don't know what you'd call me.

348
00:23:27.573 --> 00:23:28.908
I would call you a Jew.

349
00:23:32.203 --> 00:23:34.622
I consider myself a European,

350
00:23:35.915 --> 00:23:37.041
an agnostic,

351
00:23:38.417 --> 00:23:39.418
and a Socialist.

352
00:23:41.254 --> 00:23:43.506
There are children here,

353
00:23:45.383 --> 00:23:49.554
living in fields, in the
open, in... in... in mud...

354
00:23:51.639 --> 00:23:53.325
The worst of winter's
still to come

355
00:23:53.349 --> 00:23:56.018
and under the threat
of Nazi invasion.

356
00:23:57.186 --> 00:23:58.521
I have seen this

357
00:23:59.647 --> 00:24:00.982
and I cannot unsee it.

358
00:24:03.025 --> 00:24:07.405
And because I may be able
to do something about it,

359
00:24:09.574 --> 00:24:10.575
I must.

360
00:24:12.034 --> 00:24:13.411
At least try.

361
00:24:18.291 --> 00:24:20.251
The task you propose

362
00:24:21.335 --> 00:24:23.605
requires money and visas.

363
00:24:23.629 --> 00:24:25.631
I don't have them. Yet.

364
00:24:30.553 --> 00:24:31.971
But I'll get them.

365
00:24:43.524 --> 00:24:46.253
If I send these children to you,

366
00:24:46.277 --> 00:24:49.590
I'm placing their
lives in your hands.

367
00:24:49.614 --> 00:24:51.758
A very great responsibility.

368
00:24:51.782 --> 00:24:54.869
So, in the end, Mr Winton,

369
00:24:56.662 --> 00:24:58.748
it is a question of trust.

370
00:25:03.085 --> 00:25:05.004
In Hebrew, there is a saying.

371
00:25:14.513 --> 00:25:16.390
Don't start what
you can't finish.

372
00:25:29.904 --> 00:25:32.257
Hampstead, 7946.

373
00:25:32.281 --> 00:25:33.176
Mother?

374
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.427
Nicky! So good to hear you.

375
00:25:35.451 --> 00:25:36.553
Now, listen, I can't be long.

376
00:25:36.577 --> 00:25:38.680
<i>No, of course not. No, uh...</i>

377
00:25:38.704 --> 00:25:39.890
But are you all right?

378
00:25:39.914 --> 00:25:41.266
<i>Are you safe?</i>

379
00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:42.684
I'm perfectly fine.

380
00:25:42.708 --> 00:25:44.811
<i>You don't sound very convincing.</i>

381
00:25:44.835 --> 00:25:46.355
Just tell me you're
coming home, yes?

382
00:25:46.379 --> 00:25:48.190
Yes, yes, now, listen.

383
00:25:48.214 --> 00:25:49.757
<i>I need you to do
something for me.</i>

384
00:25:50.299 --> 00:25:51.777
Tell me.

385
00:25:51.801 --> 00:25:53.441
<i>And I'm afraid it's
not going to be easy.</i>

386
00:25:55.721 --> 00:25:57.699
Hello, Rudi, I'd like
to send a telegram.

387
00:25:57.723 --> 00:25:59.350
Yes, certainly,
sir, just a moment.

388
00:26:02.687 --> 00:26:04.873
To, Mr Hart, H-A-R-T...

389
00:26:04.897 --> 00:26:06.166
"H-A-R-T."

390
00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:09.002
At Crews Brothers, stockbrokers.

391
00:26:09.026 --> 00:26:10.045
Slight change of plan.

392
00:26:10.069 --> 00:26:13.382
- "Slight change."
- Stop.

393
00:26:13.406 --> 00:26:16.367
Working Prague with Refugees.

394
00:26:17.702 --> 00:26:19.036
<i>Return to office delayed.</i>

395
00:26:30.464 --> 00:26:32.985
He thought you were
official. German.

396
00:26:33.009 --> 00:26:35.445
Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry. Um...

397
00:26:35.469 --> 00:26:38.306
No, I'm... I'm... I'm
trying to help the families.

398
00:26:47.481 --> 00:26:50.252
- Madam.
- Oh.

399
00:26:50.276 --> 00:26:53.255
Good morning. My name
is Babette Winton.

400
00:26:53.279 --> 00:26:56.675
I'd like to speak to
someone in immigration.

401
00:26:56.699 --> 00:26:58.135
And where have you arrived from?

402
00:26:58.159 --> 00:27:00.971
From Hampstead, on the 24 bus.

403
00:27:00.995 --> 00:27:03.765
I'm a British citizen
seeking your advice.

404
00:27:03.789 --> 00:27:06.059
- Do you have an appoint...
- An appointment? No.

405
00:27:06.083 --> 00:27:07.668
But I'm happy to wait.

406
00:27:22.975 --> 00:27:24.185
Mr Jovak?

407
00:27:24.727 --> 00:27:25.787
Here.

408
00:27:25.811 --> 00:27:27.021
Come this way, please.

409
00:27:32.735 --> 00:27:33.879
<i>Anyone else?</i>

410
00:27:33.903 --> 00:27:37.174
Yes, actually, um,
there was a young girl

411
00:27:37.198 --> 00:27:39.801
that I first saw when Doreen
brought me here, um...

412
00:27:39.825 --> 00:27:41.261
She was about 11 or 12.

413
00:27:41.285 --> 00:27:43.347
She had a very
young baby sister.

414
00:27:43.371 --> 00:27:45.182
Applications are considered
according to protocol...

415
00:27:45.206 --> 00:27:47.684
Oh, protocol. That is
a meaningless phrase.

416
00:27:47.708 --> 00:27:50.687
You repeating it ad infinitum
really doesn't help.

417
00:27:50.711 --> 00:27:54.358
These are
unaccompanied children.

418
00:27:54.382 --> 00:27:55.817
They're children,
they are desperate,

419
00:27:55.841 --> 00:27:57.069
and they are starving.

420
00:27:57.093 --> 00:27:58.695
Like many poorer
British children.

421
00:27:58.719 --> 00:28:01.323
British children are
not facing the threat

422
00:28:01.347 --> 00:28:03.033
of imminent Nazi invasion.

423
00:28:03.057 --> 00:28:06.018
Mrs Winton, there are
other people waiting.

424
00:28:10.064 --> 00:28:11.583
If you don't mind...

425
00:28:11.607 --> 00:28:14.735
Young man, I have something
to tell you. Sit down.

426
00:28:22.535 --> 00:28:27.516
I came here 30 years ago,
from Germany, to marry.

427
00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.726
I raised my family here.

428
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:32.354
My husband is buried here.

429
00:28:32.378 --> 00:28:37.067
And what I have most
admired about this country

430
00:28:37.091 --> 00:28:41.113
is its commitment to
decency, kindness,

431
00:28:41.137 --> 00:28:43.615
and respect for others.

432
00:28:43.639 --> 00:28:46.868
I raised my son in
accordance with these values

433
00:28:46.892 --> 00:28:51.123
and he is in Prague,
now, as we speak,

434
00:28:51.147 --> 00:28:54.960
putting these values
into practice.

435
00:28:54.984 --> 00:28:58.380
I am merely asking
you to do the same.

436
00:28:58.404 --> 00:29:00.030
Is that too much to ask?

437
00:29:07.913 --> 00:29:10.767
Ask your questions, Mrs Winton.

438
00:29:10.791 --> 00:29:14.062
Thank you. Now, I need
you to concentrate

439
00:29:14.086 --> 00:29:15.838
and I need you to be very clear.

440
00:29:20.551 --> 00:29:21.677
She's 12.

441
00:29:40.738 --> 00:29:44.176
They don't know whose
baby it is. No one does.

442
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.910
She is helping care for her.

443
00:29:48.913 --> 00:29:51.123
But what about the parents?

444
00:29:52.708 --> 00:29:55.753
Hm, taken or dead.

445
00:30:07.681 --> 00:30:09.642
Right.

446
00:30:10.643 --> 00:30:11.644
Let's get on.

447
00:30:33.791 --> 00:30:35.519
<i>This is Maidenhead, 3310.</i>

448
00:30:35.543 --> 00:30:38.254
<i>Nicholas and Grete Winton.
Please leave a message.</i>

449
00:30:40.339 --> 00:30:42.025
<i>Hi, Dad.</i>

450
00:30:42.049 --> 00:30:45.070
<i>It's just me checking
in to see you're okay.</i>

451
00:30:45.094 --> 00:30:46.988
<i>We're all right. Had
just been to the clinic,</i>

452
00:30:47.012 --> 00:30:49.157
<i>everything's fine with the baby.</i>

453
00:30:49.181 --> 00:30:50.700
<i>Mum says that you're thinking</i>

454
00:30:50.724 --> 00:30:52.827
<i>about what to do
with the briefcase.</i>

455
00:30:52.851 --> 00:30:54.329
<i>Um...</i>

456
00:30:54.353 --> 00:30:56.665
<i>I know that won't
be easy for you.</i>

457
00:30:56.689 --> 00:30:59.793
<i>I'm here if you
wanna talk about it.</i>

458
00:30:59.817 --> 00:31:01.610
<i>Hope you're swimming lots.</i>

459
00:32:49.593 --> 00:32:53.281
In Munich, Nazis
took my brothers.

460
00:32:53.305 --> 00:32:56.451
My nephews tried to stop them,

461
00:32:56.475 --> 00:33:00.622
12, 10 years old, just boys.

462
00:33:00.646 --> 00:33:04.292
They were beaten and
thrown down the stairs

463
00:33:04.316 --> 00:33:06.610
and taken to the camps.

464
00:33:13.951 --> 00:33:16.638
Eva and Vera.

465
00:33:16.662 --> 00:33:19.015
These are my sister's boys,

466
00:33:19.039 --> 00:33:22.102
Honza and Tommy.

467
00:33:22.126 --> 00:33:25.254
Our family name is Diamantova.

468
00:33:29.133 --> 00:33:30.426
Oh, thank you.

469
00:33:32.344 --> 00:33:33.345
That's Vera.

470
00:33:34.221 --> 00:33:36.074
Eva.

471
00:33:36.098 --> 00:33:37.182
Honza, Tommy.

472
00:33:39.476 --> 00:33:42.122
Oh, what happened here?

473
00:33:42.146 --> 00:33:45.875
She fell. Skiing. She
loves the mountains.

474
00:33:45.899 --> 00:33:48.169
Oh. You like... You like skiing?

475
00:33:48.193 --> 00:33:49.695
I love skiing.

476
00:33:55.784 --> 00:33:58.138
Skiing and swimming.

477
00:33:58.162 --> 00:34:00.914
And swimming? Me too.

478
00:34:03.083 --> 00:34:04.853
- Morning, Rudi.
- Morning.

479
00:34:04.877 --> 00:34:06.354
Would you mind putting a call
through to this number for me?

480
00:34:06.378 --> 00:34:08.356
- Of course. Give me a moment.
- Thank you.

481
00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:11.067
And Mr Winton, you
have a telegram.

482
00:34:11.091 --> 00:34:12.593
Oh. Thank you.

483
00:34:27.149 --> 00:34:28.918
Mr Winton, your call.

484
00:34:28.942 --> 00:34:31.546
Cabin number two.

485
00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:33.506
<i>Nicky, you will not believe</i>

486
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:36.134
<i>- what they are asking for.</i>
- All right, I'm ready.

487
00:34:36.158 --> 00:34:39.387
<i>A separate visa
application for each child.</i>

488
00:34:39.411 --> 00:34:42.348
An individual sponsor
who must promise to pay

489
00:34:42.372 --> 00:34:45.059
<i>for all the child's needs.</i>

490
00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:50.148
And a fee of 50 pounds to pay
for their eventual return.

491
00:34:50.172 --> 00:34:51.775
- Fifty pounds?
<i>- Yes, I know.</i>

492
00:34:51.799 --> 00:34:52.883
Wait, there's more.

493
00:34:54.134 --> 00:34:55.904
A medical certificate,

494
00:34:55.928 --> 00:34:59.115
uh, and a foster parent
to care for the child

495
00:34:59.139 --> 00:35:00.742
till the age of 17

496
00:35:00.766 --> 00:35:03.453
or until they are
able to return home.

497
00:35:03.477 --> 00:35:04.829
Christ, Nicky!

498
00:35:04.853 --> 00:35:05.938
Yeah.

499
00:35:07.439 --> 00:35:08.941
Nicky?

500
00:35:10.025 --> 00:35:11.878
Mr Slonek. Hello.

501
00:35:11.902 --> 00:35:14.464
Hello, hello. Uh...

502
00:35:14.488 --> 00:35:16.299
I have changed my mind.

503
00:35:16.323 --> 00:35:18.343
Here are, uh, photos,

504
00:35:18.367 --> 00:35:21.870
I believe now you
will help them?

505
00:35:25.958 --> 00:35:28.126
Jan. Petr.

506
00:35:29.545 --> 00:35:31.880
And... Karel. Karel. Karel.

507
00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.926
When will they go... please?

508
00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:39.405
What did I miss?

509
00:35:39.429 --> 00:35:41.115
Nicky was just saying
we have to assume

510
00:35:41.139 --> 00:35:42.867
that this is happening.

511
00:35:42.891 --> 00:35:44.160
Yeah.

512
00:35:44.184 --> 00:35:46.037
We are moving the children.

513
00:35:46.061 --> 00:35:47.831
In big groups. By train.

514
00:35:47.855 --> 00:35:48.998
That's a two-day trip,

515
00:35:49.022 --> 00:35:50.416
which would mean
crossing Holland

516
00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.960
and the Dutch have
shut their borders

517
00:35:51.984 --> 00:35:53.086
to Jewish refugees.

518
00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:55.380
And they'd have
to cross Germany.

519
00:35:55.404 --> 00:35:57.006
Yes, but they'd only
be passing through

520
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:58.383
and on British visas.

521
00:35:58.407 --> 00:36:00.343
With British foster
parents waiting.

522
00:36:00.367 --> 00:36:01.845
Well, that is, if you can
find British foster parents.

523
00:36:01.869 --> 00:36:05.557
There are a thousand
children on that list.

524
00:36:05.581 --> 00:36:08.560
The welcome may not be as
warm as you're all imagining.

525
00:36:08.584 --> 00:36:11.229
Then we have to heat things up.

526
00:36:11.253 --> 00:36:13.314
We have to get
the press working.

527
00:36:13.338 --> 00:36:16.234
Get them moving and on our side.

528
00:36:16.258 --> 00:36:18.611
Ordinary people
wouldn't stand for this

529
00:36:18.635 --> 00:36:22.240
if they knew what was
actually happening.

530
00:36:22.264 --> 00:36:24.725
You've a lot of faith
in ordinary people.

531
00:36:26.393 --> 00:36:30.290
I do because I'm
an ordinary person.

532
00:36:30.314 --> 00:36:31.398
So am I.

533
00:36:32.566 --> 00:36:34.419
And me.

534
00:36:34.443 --> 00:36:36.462
Well, there you go.

535
00:36:36.486 --> 00:36:38.155
That's just what
we need, isn't it?

536
00:36:39.156 --> 00:36:41.593
An army of the ordinary.

537
00:36:41.617 --> 00:36:45.746
Nicky, you should go back
to London, raise funds.

538
00:36:46.371 --> 00:36:47.515
Raise a stink.

539
00:36:47.539 --> 00:36:49.642
I can do that. No problem.

540
00:36:49.666 --> 00:36:51.102
What about your job in the bank?

541
00:36:51.126 --> 00:36:53.229
Well, stock market closes
at half past three.

542
00:36:53.253 --> 00:36:55.648
And I'll take care of this end.

543
00:36:55.672 --> 00:36:57.483
- With Hana's help?
- Of course.

544
00:36:57.507 --> 00:36:59.235
Oh, God.

545
00:36:59.259 --> 00:37:01.219
We're actually doing
this, aren't we?

546
00:37:03.305 --> 00:37:05.700
Here's to the children's
section of the BCRC.

547
00:37:05.724 --> 00:37:07.726
- There isn't one.
- There is now.

548
00:37:08.894 --> 00:37:10.145
All those in favour.

549
00:37:16.318 --> 00:37:18.713
Nicky, if I may.

550
00:37:18.737 --> 00:37:20.965
What are you doing? Excuse me.

551
00:37:20.989 --> 00:37:23.009
My God.

552
00:37:23.033 --> 00:37:25.178
Those your socks?

553
00:37:25.202 --> 00:37:26.262
Look, you'll need something

554
00:37:26.286 --> 00:37:27.496
for all that paperwork.

555
00:37:28.997 --> 00:37:30.248
Thank you.

556
00:37:47.724 --> 00:37:50.078
<i>To</i> The Times' <i>letter section.</i>

557
00:37:50.102 --> 00:37:53.498
<i>Dear sir, I have just
returned from Prague,</i>

558
00:37:53.522 --> 00:37:55.625
where I was assessing the fate

559
00:37:55.649 --> 00:37:58.252
of refugees in the city.

560
00:37:58.276 --> 00:38:01.339
<i>Among the many
unfortunate souls,</i>

561
00:38:01.363 --> 00:38:03.949
<i>I found about 2,000 children</i>

00:38:04.866 --> 00:38:06.618
living in damp,

563
00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.639
overcrowded camps.

564
00:38:09.663 --> 00:38:12.558
Overcrowded, insanitary camps.

565
00:38:12.582 --> 00:38:14.477
Yes, true.

566
00:38:14.501 --> 00:38:16.187
In one of the camps,

567
00:38:16.211 --> 00:38:18.672
several have already
succumbed to disease.

568
00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:23.861
<i>I saw a mother cradling
her dead child.</i>

569
00:38:23.885 --> 00:38:26.280
<i>The thousands
struggling to survive</i>

570
00:38:26.304 --> 00:38:29.200
<i>find themselves facing the
threat of Nazi invasion</i>

571
00:38:29.224 --> 00:38:31.953
<i>and the horrors that will bring.</i>

572
00:38:31.977 --> 00:38:35.039
<i>We are working to evacuate

573
00:38:35.063 --> 00:38:39.252
<i>to safety in Britain

574
00:38:39.276 --> 00:38:44.382
<i>Will people please help with

The wanderer returns!

580
00:38:58.962 --> 00:39:01.149
Crikey, Nicky, Hart's
been apoplectic.

581
00:39:01.173 --> 00:39:02.525
Oh, well.

582
00:39:02.549 --> 00:39:03.884
There goes your bonus.

583
00:39:18.315 --> 00:39:19.316
Mother.

584
00:39:20.192 --> 00:39:22.027
Sorry. Thank you.

585
00:39:28.033 --> 00:39:29.719
I've seen your
letter in the press.

586
00:39:29.743 --> 00:39:31.953
Well, then you
understand the urgency.

587
00:39:33.371 --> 00:39:34.599
The process...

588
00:39:34.623 --> 00:39:36.893
Our first group
consists of 20 children

589
00:39:36.917 --> 00:39:38.603
who are in the most dire need.

590
00:39:38.627 --> 00:39:41.272
They will arrive by train
into Liverpool Street Station

591
00:39:41.296 --> 00:39:43.131
in two weeks' time.

592
00:39:45.634 --> 00:39:49.572
Yes, two weeks, a fortnight.

593
00:39:49.596 --> 00:39:52.575
Which is why we're
asking for your help to

594
00:39:52.599 --> 00:39:53.951
to accelerate the process.

595
00:39:53.975 --> 00:39:56.162
Applications are
dealt with in turn.

596
00:39:56.186 --> 00:39:57.497
The process takes time.

597
00:39:57.521 --> 00:39:59.082
We don't have time.

598
00:39:59.106 --> 00:40:01.608
The German army could
cross the border any day.

599
00:40:04.903 --> 00:40:07.173
Mr Leadbetter

600
00:40:07.197 --> 00:40:10.593
these are your children, yes?

601
00:40:10.617 --> 00:40:11.969
- They are.
- There are families

602
00:40:11.993 --> 00:40:15.640
just like this, just like yours,

603
00:40:15.664 --> 00:40:18.810
living in conditions
you cannot imagine.

604
00:40:18.834 --> 00:40:20.812
The threat of war
hangs over them.

605
00:40:20.836 --> 00:40:23.231
What they have done for you

606
00:40:23.255 --> 00:40:26.692
is to stand against
Nazi expansionism.

607
00:40:26.716 --> 00:40:28.903
All they ask, in return,

608
00:40:28.927 --> 00:40:31.989
is a temporary refuge
for their children.

609
00:40:32.013 --> 00:40:35.785
From whatever horror
is yet to come.

610
00:40:35.809 --> 00:40:38.645
Isn't that the least this
country should offer?

611
00:40:42.983 --> 00:40:44.627
Provided your
paperwork is in order.

612
00:40:44.651 --> 00:40:45.986
It is in perfect order.

613
00:40:47.571 --> 00:40:49.132
Then I'll do my best.

614
00:40:49.156 --> 00:40:52.993
Two weeks, where are we
going to find the money?

615
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:54.887
We'll find it.

616
00:40:54.911 --> 00:40:57.473
In two weeks?

617
00:40:57.497 --> 00:41:00.768
- And the foster families?
- I know. We'll do it.

618
00:41:00.792 --> 00:41:03.229
Olga Santer... Santer, yes.

619
00:41:03.253 --> 00:41:06.715
And Petr Slonek.
Slonek, Petr, yes.

620
00:41:11.553 --> 00:41:13.722
Right. It's a start.

621
00:41:25.984 --> 00:41:28.653
<i>Jan Slonek, number 174.</i>

622
00:41:29.654 --> 00:41:32.157
Petr Slonek, 144.

623
00:41:35.368 --> 00:41:36.578
<i>Rosa Lenart,</i>

624
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:40.391
number 529.

625
00:41:40.415 --> 00:41:42.643
Good. Tommy Katschinsky,

626
00:41:42.667 --> 00:41:45.646
number nine.
Michael Lappert, 46.

627
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:48.274
Landesmann, 19. Next.

628
00:41:48.298 --> 00:41:49.942
<i>Jacob</i>

629
00:41:49.966 --> 00:41:52.886
<i>number twenty-four.</i>

630
00:41:55.805 --> 00:41:58.117
<i>I have a family from Shropshire</i>

631
00:41:58.141 --> 00:42:01.662
<i>that will take a
girl, 8 to 11 years,</i>

632
00:42:01.686 --> 00:42:03.831
<i>and Mr and Mrs Horrell</i>

633
00:42:03.855 --> 00:42:06.542
that will take a boy, just one,

634
00:42:06.566 --> 00:42:09.962
but ideally under
eight and brown haired.

635
00:42:09.986 --> 00:42:11.821
There you go.

636
00:42:15.575 --> 00:42:17.345
Martin.

637
00:42:17.369 --> 00:42:19.138
So sorry I wasn't
with you in Prague.

638
00:42:19.162 --> 00:42:20.514
Not at all.

639
00:42:20.538 --> 00:42:23.434
Anyway, I'm here
now. What can I do?

640
00:42:23.458 --> 00:42:26.270
Well, we've got, uh, 20
children ready to travel

641
00:42:26.294 --> 00:42:27.855
and only eight foster homes.

642
00:42:27.879 --> 00:42:29.941
There's plenty of people
who'd gladly take a child,

643
00:42:29.965 --> 00:42:31.651
but they can't raise
the 50 pounds guarantee.

644
00:42:31.675 --> 00:42:36.197
So, that's what we need
most right now. It's money.

645
00:42:36.221 --> 00:42:37.472
Let me make some calls.

646
00:42:38.181 --> 00:42:39.158
Phone?

647
00:42:39.182 --> 00:42:41.160
Come with me. Coffee?

648
00:42:41.184 --> 00:42:43.621
Nicky, five pounds!

649
00:42:43.645 --> 00:42:47.875
Five pounds, 20 pounds from
the Girl Guides and then...

650
00:42:47.899 --> 00:42:50.378
That's 100 in one day!

651
00:42:50.402 --> 00:42:53.863
<i>And then</i> Picture Post
<i>has raised 90 pounds.</i>

652
00:43:15.176 --> 00:43:17.363
Ready? We've foster families

653
00:43:17.387 --> 00:43:20.700
for, uh, Marlia Keller,

654
00:43:20.724 --> 00:43:24.453
<i>uh, Kristina Novotka...</i> Mm-hmm.

655
00:43:24.477 --> 00:43:27.373
- The Blaufrank twins.
- <i>Yes.</i>

656
00:43:27.397 --> 00:43:29.959
<i>And Jan and Petr Slonek.</i>

657
00:43:29.983 --> 00:43:32.086
And their brother?

658
00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:33.945
No. No one would take all three.

659
00:43:34.612 --> 00:43:35.589
Goodness.

660
00:43:35.613 --> 00:43:37.967
Tell them it won't be long now.

661
00:43:37.991 --> 00:43:40.386
- We'll be moving them soon.
<i>- Nicky,</i>

662
00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:42.096
it's getting harder here.

663
00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:44.956
Two more people from Doreen's
list have disappeared.

664
00:43:47.042 --> 00:43:48.460
<i>I don't know how long we've got.</i>

665
00:44:54.859 --> 00:44:57.004
Come on, then. Good lads.

666
00:44:57.028 --> 00:44:59.823
There you go, good lads.

667
00:45:01.157 --> 00:45:02.158
All right.

668
00:45:43.575 --> 00:45:45.219
Thank God you're
here. I was worried.

669
00:45:45.243 --> 00:45:46.327
I'm so sorry.

670
00:45:48.079 --> 00:45:49.622
All right, all right, all right.

671
00:45:51.749 --> 00:45:54.562
- Petr Slonek.
- Slonek. Petr and Jan.

672
00:45:54.586 --> 00:45:56.021
174.

673
00:45:56.045 --> 00:45:57.606
Thank you.

144.144.

675
00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:01.068
So, that's only one
we're missing, now.

676
00:46:01.092 --> 00:46:03.154
Check them all.

677
00:46:03.178 --> 00:46:04.262

682
00:46:24.324 --> 00:46:26.826
Okay. Okay.

683
00:46:28.036 --> 00:46:29.787

<i>The train at platform eight</i>

712
00:49:07.362 --> 00:49:08.946
Harland?

713
00:51:10.151 --> 00:51:11.628
Hi, Nicky.

714
00:51:11.652 --> 00:51:12.755
Oh, hello, Geoff.

715
00:51:12.779 --> 00:51:14.089
You wanna come through?

716
00:51:14.113 --> 00:51:15.549
Yes, thank you.

717
00:51:15.573 --> 00:51:16.842
All right?

718
00:51:16.866 --> 00:51:19.261
Yes, of course I am.

719
00:51:19.285 --> 00:51:20.953
You don't have to
look so nervous.

720
00:51:21.704 --> 00:51:22.806
I can't help it.

721
00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:24.099
Whenever I see you comin',

722
00:51:24.123 --> 00:51:25.601
I know it's gonna
cost me a fortune.

723
00:51:25.625 --> 00:51:27.210
Oh, all in a good cause.

724
00:51:31.214 --> 00:51:33.400
So, which is it this time?

725
00:51:33.424 --> 00:51:36.177
Samaritans? MENCAP? Abbeyfield?

726
00:51:37.678 --> 00:51:41.617
Oh, something new.
Or rather, old.

727
00:51:41.641 --> 00:51:42.868
Take a seat, Nicky.

728
00:51:42.892 --> 00:51:45.186
Yes. Thank you.

729
00:51:51.901 --> 00:51:57.674
It's about, uh, documents
from the Second World War

730
00:51:57.698 --> 00:52:00.552
- rather relevant for today.
- The war?

731
00:52:00.576 --> 00:52:03.263
- Yes.
- Oh, it's exciting.

732
00:52:03.287 --> 00:52:07.601
It's the, uh, 50th anniversary
of the outbreak coming up.

733
00:52:07.625 --> 00:52:09.061
Yes, I suppose it must be.

734
00:52:09.085 --> 00:52:11.313
Yeah, we're planning a
series of special editions.

735
00:52:11.337 --> 00:52:12.606
- Oh.
- Where did you serve?

736
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:14.233
Army, Navy?

737
00:52:14.257 --> 00:52:16.568
Oh, well, that's neither
here nor there, is it?

738
00:52:16.592 --> 00:52:18.135
Yeah, I bet you
got some stories.

739
00:52:19.345 --> 00:52:21.156
It's really not about me.

740
00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:23.724
It's actually very
important. It's, uh,

741
00:52:24.809 --> 00:52:26.477
about refugees.

742
00:52:28.104 --> 00:52:29.188
Refugees?

743
00:52:30.147 --> 00:52:31.148
Yeah.

744
00:52:32.650 --> 00:52:34.753
I'm not really seeing

745
00:52:34.777 --> 00:52:37.321
the Maidenhead
angle in refugees.

746
00:52:45.788 --> 00:52:48.183
<i>We wanna be famous.</i>

747
00:52:48.207 --> 00:52:50.644
<i>We wanna be on TV.</i>

748
00:52:50.668 --> 00:52:53.212
<i>Famous, famous Famous, famous.</i>

749
00:53:31.959 --> 00:53:34.187
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hello.

750
00:53:34.211 --> 00:53:35.689
Guess who this is?

751
00:53:35.713 --> 00:53:37.691
Oh, good afternoon.
Good afternoon.

752
00:53:37.715 --> 00:53:39.342
I'm meeting Mr Martin Blake.

753
00:53:40.176 --> 00:53:41.278
Thank you.

754
00:53:41.302 --> 00:53:43.322
- Oh, certainly.
- Thank you.

755
00:53:43.346 --> 00:53:44.489
If you'd like to follow me?

756
00:53:44.513 --> 00:53:45.765
Yes. Thank you.

757
00:54:01.739 --> 00:54:04.468
Hello, Martin. Thank
you. How are you?

758
00:54:04.492 --> 00:54:05.844
- Nicky.
- Good to see you.

759
00:54:05.868 --> 00:54:07.971
So, you're footloose

760
00:54:07.995 --> 00:54:09.348
for a couple of days?

761
00:54:09.372 --> 00:54:10.724
Yes. Looks like it, doesn't it?

762
00:54:10.748 --> 00:54:12.225
Time to catch up. I'm glad.

763
00:54:12.249 --> 00:54:13.936
Yeah, it's not much
time, I'm afraid,

764
00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:17.314
because, um, I've been given
my to-do list, you know?

765
00:54:17.338 --> 00:54:19.191
Grete's reorganising everything

766
00:54:19.215 --> 00:54:21.109
- before the baby arrives.
- Oh, yes!

767
00:54:21.133 --> 00:54:22.986
A grandfather. You excited?

768
00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:25.322
No, I'm bloody terrified. Why?

769
00:54:25.346 --> 00:54:27.282
- I don't know.
- It'll be fun, I'm sure.

770
00:54:27.306 --> 00:54:29.368
Oh, really? If you say so.

771
00:54:29.392 --> 00:54:32.579
Uh, anyway, at the
moment, we're just, um,

772
00:54:32.603 --> 00:54:34.373
throwing out a lot of old
stuff, you know? And, uh...

773
00:54:34.397 --> 00:54:36.875
- Piles up.
- Yes, it does. Yeah.

774
00:54:36.899 --> 00:54:38.043
You have to be ruthless.

775
00:54:38.067 --> 00:54:40.045
- I know.
- Yeah. Box files and,

776
00:54:40.069 --> 00:54:41.838
uh, records of all the old
charity work, you know?

777
00:54:41.862 --> 00:54:43.465
You've always been so busy.

778
00:54:43.489 --> 00:54:44.967
Oh, yeah.

779
00:54:44.991 --> 00:54:47.219
Do you still volunteer
with the Samaritans?

780
00:54:47.243 --> 00:54:48.512
No, no. They kicked me out.

781
00:54:48.536 --> 00:54:50.389
What? What on earth for?

782
00:54:50.413 --> 00:54:53.684
A woman, uh, phoned in
and told me she was, um

783
00:54:53.708 --> 00:54:55.352
planning on killing herself.

784
00:54:55.376 --> 00:54:56.937
I said, "Oh, dear me, there
must be something else"

785
00:54:56.961 --> 00:54:58.230
"you'd rather be
doing." You didn't.

786
00:54:58.254 --> 00:54:59.481
Yes, I did.

787
00:54:59.505 --> 00:55:01.525
She told me that
she wanted to visit

788
00:55:01.549 --> 00:55:03.235
her daughter in America.

789
00:55:03.259 --> 00:55:05.112
But her doctor warned
her that the journey

790
00:55:05.136 --> 00:55:06.780
would probably kill her.

791
00:55:06.804 --> 00:55:08.281
I said, "Well, that's exactly
what you want, isn't it?"

792
00:55:08.305 --> 00:55:09.408
"To be killed?"

793
00:55:09.432 --> 00:55:11.493
Yeah, well, she
had a good laugh.

794
00:55:11.517 --> 00:55:12.995
We both had a good laugh.

795
00:55:13.019 --> 00:55:14.830
She went off to America.
She saw her daughter.

796
00:55:14.854 --> 00:55:15.998
Had a wonderful time. Came back,

797
00:55:16.022 --> 00:55:17.374
- was happy as a lark.
- Oh.

798
00:55:17.398 --> 00:55:20.043
But, uh, ooh, the Samaritans.
Oh, God bless them.

799
00:55:20.067 --> 00:55:21.294
They gave me a real bollocking,

800
00:55:21.318 --> 00:55:22.629
pardon my French,

801
00:55:22.653 --> 00:55:24.423
and, uh, told me I'd
broken all the rules.

802
00:55:24.447 --> 00:55:26.383
Well, you know, I couldn't
just sit there, could I?

803
00:55:26.407 --> 00:55:28.802
I mean, you're listening
to a bunch of lonely people

804
00:55:28.826 --> 00:55:30.554
when there was something
I could actually say

805
00:55:30.578 --> 00:55:31.787
to help cheer them up.

806
00:55:34.165 --> 00:55:35.809
You might wanna
slow down anyway.

807
00:55:35.833 --> 00:55:38.270
What, with the baby coming.

808
00:55:38.294 --> 00:55:39.688
Why would I want to slow down?

809
00:55:39.712 --> 00:55:40.856
Oh, to enjoy it.

810
00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:42.566
You've done enough.

811
00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:44.133
No. It's never enough, is it?

812
00:55:46.218 --> 00:55:47.988
Did you, uh, need more
time with the wine list?

813
00:55:48.012 --> 00:55:49.263
Oh, yes, um...

814
00:55:50.931 --> 00:55:52.224
They have nice <i>Château Neuf.</i>

815
00:55:56.353 --> 00:55:57.831
We'll have the <i>Chablis.</i>

816
00:55:57.855 --> 00:55:59.273
Oh, dear. Thank you.

817
00:56:00.649 --> 00:56:02.335
Where were we, now? Oh, yes.

818
00:56:02.359 --> 00:56:05.255
When I was clearing
out all the papers,

819
00:56:05.279 --> 00:56:08.175
I came across that old,
uh, scrapbook from Prague.

820
00:56:08.199 --> 00:56:09.342
- Do you remember that?
- I do.

821
00:56:09.366 --> 00:56:11.344
Yes, you're not
throwing that out.

822
00:56:11.368 --> 00:56:12.804
No, I think it could be quite

823
00:56:12.828 --> 00:56:14.514
an important little
record, in its way.

824
00:56:14.538 --> 00:56:17.017
You know, full of history
we should learn from.

825
00:56:17.041 --> 00:56:18.959
- It is.
- Yeah.

826
00:56:21.337 --> 00:56:23.065
Look, maybe the, um,

827
00:56:23.089 --> 00:56:26.359
the Wiener archive might
like it. In London.

828
00:56:26.383 --> 00:56:27.986
Yeah?

829
00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:30.572
I know people on the
board, I could mention it.

830
00:56:30.596 --> 00:56:33.658
Yeah, well, it'll probably
just gather dust there.

831
00:56:33.682 --> 00:56:35.827
I mean, I tried showing
it to the Editor

832
00:56:35.851 --> 00:56:37.829
of the Maidenhead
newspaper, what's it called?

833
00:56:37.853 --> 00:56:40.540
<i>The Advertiser</i> or something.

834
00:56:40.564 --> 00:56:43.210
And, um, it's funny
because when I told him

835
00:56:43.234 --> 00:56:44.920
about the refugees, he said,

836
00:56:44.944 --> 00:56:46.779
"I don't quite get
the Maidenhead angle."

837
00:56:48.155 --> 00:56:49.633
So, uh, he's a bit
of a twit, really.

838
00:56:49.657 --> 00:56:51.968
Well, you might like to
donate it to a museum.

839
00:56:51.992 --> 00:56:54.137
In Prague? Or in Israel?

840
00:56:54.161 --> 00:56:55.881
Most of the children
were Jewish, after all.

841
00:56:56.330 --> 00:56:57.414
Prague.

842
00:57:00.084 --> 00:57:02.670
Well... Yeah.

843
00:57:03.712 --> 00:57:04.755
Tell me something...

844
00:57:07.258 --> 00:57:08.652
Do you ever think
about the children

845
00:57:08.676 --> 00:57:10.153
and what happened to them?

846
00:57:10.177 --> 00:57:12.405
Yes, yes, I do.
From time to time.

847
00:57:12.429 --> 00:57:13.597
Do you?

848
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:16.910
No, not really.

849
00:57:16.934 --> 00:57:19.538
Well, maybe a little, recently.

850
00:57:19.562 --> 00:57:23.125
It is incredible.
What you achieved.

851
00:57:23.149 --> 00:57:24.459
Oh, I don't think
of it that way.

852
00:57:24.483 --> 00:57:25.860
No, no, no, no, I mean it.

853
00:57:26.694 --> 00:57:28.505
Truly.

854
00:57:28.529 --> 00:57:29.965
I mean, you should be proud.

855
00:57:29.989 --> 00:57:32.008
- Well.
- Save one life,

856
00:57:32.032 --> 00:57:34.719
save the world. You know?

857
00:57:34.743 --> 00:57:37.222
Well, it's nothing
to brag about.

858
00:57:37.246 --> 00:57:39.266
I mean, look at Doreen
and, uh, Trevor.

859
00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:40.642
They did far more than I did

860
00:57:40.666 --> 00:57:41.893
and they took all the risks.

861
00:57:41.917 --> 00:57:44.437
And they actually
stayed in Prague.

862
00:57:44.461 --> 00:57:48.132
You know, Nicky, telling
people isn't bragging.

863
00:57:49.884 --> 00:57:51.760
No.

864
00:58:24.835 --> 00:58:26.688
Hampstead, 7946.

865
00:58:26.712 --> 00:58:28.940
The Germans crossed the
frontier this morning.

866
00:58:28.964 --> 00:58:30.025
<i>They've already taken over</i>

867
00:58:30.049 --> 00:58:31.568
<i>- the ministry.</i>
- Oh, God.

868
00:58:31.592 --> 00:58:34.696
Hitler's motorcade just
went past the hotel.

869
00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:36.055
He was waving.

870
00:58:48.025 --> 00:58:51.504
What does this mean? For us?

871
00:58:51.528 --> 00:58:55.467
I have to go. We need
to check safe houses.

872
00:58:55.491 --> 00:58:57.469
Just be careful.

873
00:58:57.493 --> 00:59:00.204
Doreen? Doree...

874
00:59:08.712 --> 00:59:10.965
It's not safe for them
here. Please, get them home.

875
00:59:13.050 --> 00:59:14.969
Just make sure all the
lists are locked up.

876
00:59:43.747 --> 00:59:45.558
<i>Downing Street has advised</i>

877
00:59:45.582 --> 00:59:48.728
<i>that this development does not
mean that Germany is at war.</i>

878
00:59:48.752 --> 00:59:50.438
<i>The Germans are
understood to have taken</i>

879
00:59:50.462 --> 00:59:53.316
<i>an administrative position
in Czechoslovakia,</i>

880
00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:55.694
<i>replacing the
government in Prague.</i>

881
00:59:55.718 --> 00:59:56.820
<i>Flights from Prague...</i>

882
00:59:56.844 --> 00:59:58.530
What happens now?

883
00:59:58.554 --> 01:00:01.032
We work harder.

884
01:00:01.056 --> 01:00:04.577
Instead of standing here
wringing our hands in despair.

885
01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:06.162
We need more trains.

886
01:00:06.186 --> 01:00:08.373
We do whatever it takes
to make that happen.

887
01:00:08.397 --> 01:00:10.208
We find more homes.

888
01:00:10.232 --> 01:00:12.669
We place the children faster.

889
01:00:12.693 --> 01:00:14.379
We're doing as much as we can.

890
01:00:14.403 --> 01:00:16.405
It's not enough, though, is it?

891
01:00:19.658 --> 01:00:21.428
Look, we cannot

892
01:00:21.452 --> 01:00:24.514
we cannot let these people down.

893
01:00:24.538 --> 01:00:26.766
<i>Well, they tell us the
borders are still open.</i>

894
01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:29.293
The thing is now every
visa has to be approved

895
01:00:30.544 --> 01:00:32.147
and stamped by the Gestapo.

896
01:00:32.171 --> 01:00:34.381
<i>The bastards are all over
bloody everything now.</i>

897
01:00:38.844 --> 01:00:40.405
Mr Winton? Oh, yeah. Oh, hello.

898
01:00:40.429 --> 01:00:42.157
<i>The New Statesman.</i>

899
01:00:42.181 --> 01:00:43.742
Oh, hi.

900
01:00:43.766 --> 01:00:45.410
Uh, shall we speak as we go?

901
01:00:45.434 --> 01:00:46.786
Uh, yes, please.

902
01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:48.038
I don't think I can recall

903
01:00:48.062 --> 01:00:51.249
ever seeing anything
quite so moving.

904
01:00:51.273 --> 01:00:53.877
How many are there? There
must be, uh, nearly a hundred.

905
01:00:53.901 --> 01:00:55.837
Uh, yes, yes. Well
over a hundred.

906
01:00:55.861 --> 01:01:00.467
Hello. Uh, and this is our
largest transport so far.

907
01:01:00.491 --> 01:01:01.551
<i>And this is your fourth train.</i>

908
01:01:01.575 --> 01:01:02.927
<i>Are there more planned?</i>

909
01:01:02.951 --> 01:01:04.471
<i>Yes, absolutely.</i>

910
01:01:04.495 --> 01:01:06.806
<i>The fifth train's
only a few weeks away</i>

911
01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:08.725
<i>with more trains already booked.</i>

912
01:01:08.749 --> 01:01:12.145
<i>The eighth is confirmed, and
the ninth's in preparation</i>

913
01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:14.314
<i>and, um, hundreds of
children ready to board,</i>

914
01:01:14.338 --> 01:01:16.775
<i>but there are thousands
more who need our help</i>

915
01:01:16.799 --> 01:01:18.610
<i>all over Czechoslovakia.</i>

916
01:01:18.634 --> 01:01:21.446
<i>And these are children who are
homeless, they're starving.</i>

917
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:24.157
<i>And we don't know how long
the border will remain open.</i>

918
01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:27.059
<i>So, we do desperately need
donations and foster homes.</i>

919
01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:36.002
Hello? <i>Nicky.</i>

920
01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:37.962
Nicky, it's me.

921
01:01:37.986 --> 01:01:40.465
Um, look, we have one or two
missing from the next list.

922
01:01:40.489 --> 01:01:42.842
Missing? <i>Yes, I don't know.</i>

923
01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:47.514
Either they panicked or...
or they were arrested.

924
01:01:47.538 --> 01:01:50.124
Uh, right. Well, um, you'd
better give me their names.

925
01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:53.836
This one, ah.

926
01:01:54.962 --> 01:01:57.714
That's her. Lenka Weiss.

927
01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:00.884
There was a baby, too.

928
01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:05.889
Damn.

929
01:02:09.435 --> 01:02:11.579
Nicky,

930
01:02:11.603 --> 01:02:15.125
you must know we
cannot save them all.

931
01:02:15.149 --> 01:02:17.317
You have to forgive
yourself that.

932
01:02:45.053 --> 01:02:47.365
If you want Leadbetter,
he's on his hols.

933
01:02:47.389 --> 01:02:49.659
Week in Eastbourne,
shame about the rain.

934
01:02:49.683 --> 01:02:51.661
Look, I urgently
need three visas

935
01:02:51.685 --> 01:02:53.621
for a transport leaving
Prague next week.

936
01:02:53.645 --> 01:02:56.356
Sorry. Can't help you there.

937
01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:02.881
- Trevor.
- Is everything all right?

938
01:03:02.905 --> 01:03:06.050
Listen, we're three visas short,

939
01:03:06.074 --> 01:03:10.805
Isabel Keller and Eva
and Vera Diamantova.

940
01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:13.248
<i>Is there anything you can do?</i>

941
01:03:26.053 --> 01:03:28.740
I don't know what you're doing.

942
01:03:28.764 --> 01:03:30.933
But if you're doing what
I think you're doing,

943
01:03:31.850 --> 01:03:33.477
I don't want to know.

944
01:03:37.064 --> 01:03:38.732
Train leaves at eight.

945
01:04:14.893 --> 01:04:16.246
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

946
01:04:16.270 --> 01:04:17.750
He should have been
here an hour ago.

947
01:04:28.574 --> 01:04:30.385
- Do you have them?
- Yes.

948
01:04:30.409 --> 01:04:32.744
We have them.

949
01:05:52.115 --> 01:05:53.575
They've left Prague.

950
01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:40.122
Yes.

951
01:07:01.518 --> 01:07:03.645
Why does England
want all these Jews?

952
01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:25.500
Miss Howson from Putney, please.

953
01:07:26.418 --> 01:07:29.772
Diamantova, Eva.

954
01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:32.650
Um, along here,
please. Uh, yes, sir.

955
01:07:32.674 --> 01:07:34.986
Thank you, Mrs MacFarlane.

956
01:07:35.010 --> 01:07:36.362
Mrs MacFarlane?

957
01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:37.471
Hello.

958
01:07:38.972 --> 01:07:41.701
Thank you. There they are.

959
01:07:41.725 --> 01:07:44.287
Thank you. Uh, Diamantova, Vera.

960
01:07:44.311 --> 01:07:46.456
Lovely to meet you.

961
01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:48.541
Mrs Rainford.

962
01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:51.151
Yes. Sorry, excuse me.

963
01:07:52.277 --> 01:07:53.278
Hello, dear.

964
01:07:54.613 --> 01:07:55.614
Hello. Thank you.

965
01:07:58.533 --> 01:07:59.534
Come along.

966
01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:04.056
Are you hungry?

967
01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.600
Someone needs to
tell these people

968
01:08:05.624 --> 01:08:06.976
that they've only got
the children temporarily.

969
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.105
They've all got
families to return to.

970
01:08:11.129 --> 01:08:12.857
Our most urgent cases yet.

971
01:08:12.881 --> 01:08:14.984
They're booked on a
train, the ninth train,

972
01:08:15.008 --> 01:08:16.360
in three days' time.

973
01:08:16.384 --> 01:08:17.886
Please, Leadbetter.

974
01:08:26.311 --> 01:08:28.396
We'll do it. Of course.

975
01:08:29.356 --> 01:08:30.357
Thank you.

976
01:08:55.715 --> 01:08:56.758
Hello?

977
01:09:07.602 --> 01:09:09.372
<i>Today's main event.</i>

978
01:09:09.396 --> 01:09:14.418
<i>Germany has invaded Poland
and has bombed many towns.</i>

979
01:09:14.442 --> 01:09:18.798
<i>General mobilisation has been
ordered in Britain and France.</i>

980
01:09:18.822 --> 01:09:22.426
<i>Parliament was summoned for
six o'clock this evening.</i>

981
01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:25.388
<i>The mobilisation of the navy,
army and the air force...</i>

982
01:09:25.412 --> 01:09:28.724
Winton, where're
you going? Winton?

983
01:09:28.748 --> 01:09:30.309
There's nothing you
can do for them now.

984
01:09:30.333 --> 01:09:31.585
Winton!

985
01:09:42.804 --> 01:09:44.156
Excuse me. Excuse me.

986
01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:45.992
Excuse me. Stop pushing.

987
01:09:46.016 --> 01:09:47.326
Look, listen, what's happening
to the international trains?

988
01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:48.828
I don't know any
more than you do.

989
01:09:48.852 --> 01:09:50.621
There's a train due
to leave from Prague.

990
01:09:50.645 --> 01:09:52.915
You need to go to
the station now.

991
01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:54.083
I am staying to help.

992
01:09:54.107 --> 01:09:55.710
No, no.

993
01:09:55.734 --> 01:09:58.987
If they catch you, I can't
protect you. Go, now!

994
01:10:44.491 --> 01:10:45.468
Trevor.

995
01:10:45.492 --> 01:10:46.552
Are you all right?

996
01:10:46.576 --> 01:10:47.887
Yes, I am.

997
01:10:47.911 --> 01:10:49.096
I'm... I'm going to
go back to Doreen.

998
01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:51.223
- Should I...
- You should leave now.

999
01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:54.560
You have your papers.
Go with the children.

1000
01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:55.645
See you in London.

1001
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:56.753
Be careful.

1002
01:10:58.838 --> 01:11:00.674
You too. Bye.

1003
01:11:43.466 --> 01:11:45.319
Hello. Hello, darling.

1004
01:11:45.343 --> 01:11:47.947
Welcome back.

1005
01:11:47.971 --> 01:11:49.472
Ah. Mm.

1006
01:11:50.682 --> 01:11:51.975
Here you go.

1007
01:11:58.732 --> 01:12:00.626
Goodness.

1008
01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:01.818
Come and see this.

1009
01:12:03.111 --> 01:12:04.112
Big surprise.

1010
01:12:15.957 --> 01:12:17.435
Well...

1011
01:12:17.459 --> 01:12:20.521
You have got a lot done.

1012
01:12:20.545 --> 01:12:23.214
Yeah. Do you want a cup of tea?

1013
01:12:33.892 --> 01:12:35.453
<i>Hello, Mr Winton.</i>

1014
01:12:35.477 --> 01:12:37.288
<i>This is Karl Caplan
at the Weiner Library.</i>

1015
01:12:37.312 --> 01:12:38.622
<i>Uh, Martin Blake</i>

1016
01:12:38.646 --> 01:12:40.249
<i>gave us your details.</i> Oh.

1017
01:12:40.273 --> 01:12:41.917
<i>We have a researcher
who we think</i>

1018
01:12:41.941 --> 01:12:44.170
<i>might find your archives
very interesting.</i>

1019
01:12:44.194 --> 01:12:50.194
<i>So, if you can, please call
us back on 01-636-7247.</i>

1020
01:12:50.575 --> 01:12:52.911
<i>We look forward to hearing
from you. Many thanks.</i>

1021
01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:58.851
Um, I just mentioned
it in passing.

1022
01:12:58.875 --> 01:13:01.228
- Hmm.
- But, uh,

1023
01:13:01.252 --> 01:13:04.214
Martin, uh, he got
straight onto them.

1024
01:13:05.298 --> 01:13:08.652
And, uh... You know...

1025
01:13:08.676 --> 01:13:11.572
But I don't want it
to go into a library.

1026
01:13:11.596 --> 01:13:13.032
Why not?

1027
01:13:13.056 --> 01:13:15.284
Oh, well, it won't
teach anyone anything

1028
01:13:15.308 --> 01:13:16.601
stuck on the shelf.

1029
01:13:21.439 --> 01:13:22.690
Then call them.

1030
01:13:24.192 --> 01:13:25.193
Talk to them.

1031
01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:33.219
Yes. Well, I'm very grateful.

1032
01:13:33.243 --> 01:13:34.845
<i>Well, we look forward
to seeing you.</i>

1033
01:13:34.869 --> 01:13:35.954
Thank you.

1034
01:13:41.167 --> 01:13:43.521
Tell me.

1035
01:13:43.545 --> 01:13:46.982
Well, there's this woman who
wants to see the scrapbook.

1036
01:13:47.006 --> 01:13:48.442
She's a historian,

1037
01:13:48.466 --> 01:13:50.986
married to some... a
man from Czechoslovakia.

1038
01:13:51.010 --> 01:13:52.780
His name is Robert Maxwell.

1039
01:13:52.804 --> 01:13:54.156
The newspaper man?

1040
01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:56.826
Yes, that's right and, uh,

1041
01:13:56.850 --> 01:13:59.328
she's running some
kind of a conference

1042
01:13:59.352 --> 01:14:01.080
and she wants to meet me.

1043
01:14:01.104 --> 01:14:03.356
Elizabeth Maxwell, she
calls herself Betty.

1044
01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:06.568
She's French, apparently.

1045
01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:37.283
I'm Nicholas Winton.

1046
01:14:37.307 --> 01:14:38.907
Good afternoon. We've
been expecting you.

1047
01:14:46.441 --> 01:14:48.878
Oh. Oh, thank you so much

1048
01:14:48.902 --> 01:14:50.212
for coming all this way.

1049
01:14:50.236 --> 01:14:54.091
Here it is. The scrapbook.

1050
01:14:54.115 --> 01:14:57.803
Um, relates back

1051
01:14:57.827 --> 01:15:01.015
to some time I spent in
Prague before the war.

1052
01:15:01.039 --> 01:15:02.415
It's a little heavy, I'm afraid.

1053
01:15:04.959 --> 01:15:06.044
Yeah.

1054
01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:10.608
Now, a lot of that stuff
is just touristy stuff.

1055
01:15:10.632 --> 01:15:13.402
Postcards and so
on and so forth.

1056
01:15:13.426 --> 01:15:16.363
And, uh... Yes, there
are all... That's it.

1057
01:15:16.387 --> 01:15:17.698
There're some letters

1058
01:15:17.722 --> 01:15:20.242
relating to the
transport of children,

1059
01:15:20.266 --> 01:15:22.227
- uh, to Britain.
- Ah.

1060
01:15:23.895 --> 01:15:25.748
These are the eight
children you saved?

1061
01:15:25.772 --> 01:15:28.042
No, no. It was a
few more than that.

1062
01:15:28.066 --> 01:15:30.419
If you turn the
pages, you can see.

1063
01:15:30.443 --> 01:15:33.130
I sent out those cards,
uh for people to,

1064
01:15:33.154 --> 01:15:35.007
uh, choose, you know?

1065
01:15:35.031 --> 01:15:36.967
And, [chuckles] I must
say it was a bit like, um,

1066
01:15:36.991 --> 01:15:38.594
it was bit like
selling soap powder,

1067
01:15:38.618 --> 01:15:40.346
if you know what I mean.

1068
01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:42.181
I couldn't for the life of
me think how else I could,

1069
01:15:42.205 --> 01:15:45.059
uh, find enough families
to take in so many kids.

1070
01:15:45.083 --> 01:15:46.477
Uh, forgive me but
how many children

1071
01:15:46.501 --> 01:15:47.603
are we speaking about?

1072
01:15:47.627 --> 01:15:51.398
Oh. Uh... [chuckles] 669.

1073
01:15:51.422 --> 01:15:54.526
We successfully placed.

1074
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:57.738
You... You... You
brought 669 children

1075
01:15:57.762 --> 01:15:58.822
from Prague to England?

1076
01:15:58.846 --> 01:16:02.076
Well, I mean with my colleagues

1077
01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:03.327
Doreen Warriner,

1078
01:16:03.351 --> 01:16:05.329
Trevor Chadwick,
and Hana and um...

1079
01:16:05.353 --> 01:16:07.539
But there were so many other
people involved, you know,

1080
01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:10.417
and my own mother.
She was a great help.

1081
01:16:10.441 --> 01:16:11.877
And I suppose...

1082
01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:13.587
I suppose I'm the
only one left, now.

1083
01:16:13.611 --> 01:16:15.321
At least I think I am.

1084
01:16:17.323 --> 01:16:19.260
Uh, the children
that are crossed out

1085
01:16:19.284 --> 01:16:20.970
are the ones we found homes for.

1086
01:16:20.994 --> 01:16:23.973
And the faces that
are not crossed out?

1087
01:16:23.997 --> 01:16:26.308
Ah, well, they were
the less fortunate

1088
01:16:26.332 --> 01:16:29.919
and, uh, it was a
lottery, I'm afraid.

1089
01:16:34.215 --> 01:16:36.151
You wrote to the president
of the United States?

1090
01:16:36.175 --> 01:16:38.904
Fat lot of good he was.

1091
01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:41.240
I never heard back from him.

1092
01:16:41.264 --> 01:16:44.118
Yeah, it's disappointing,
I must say.

1093
01:16:44.142 --> 01:16:46.203
Oh, yes, now, these, uh...

1094
01:16:46.227 --> 01:16:48.831
Those there are the
names of the children

1095
01:16:48.855 --> 01:16:50.815
and their new addresses.

1096
01:16:52.817 --> 01:16:54.545
Excuse me, Mr Winton.

1097
01:16:54.569 --> 01:16:56.505
This is not exactly
what I was expecting.

1098
01:16:56.529 --> 01:16:57.756
I'm a little taken aback

1099
01:16:57.780 --> 01:16:59.925
at the scale of your operation.

1100
01:16:59.949 --> 01:17:01.844
Oh. Oh, you know,

1101
01:17:01.868 --> 01:17:04.847
if we'd had more
money, more time

1102
01:17:04.871 --> 01:17:06.849
and more government support

1103
01:17:06.873 --> 01:17:08.958
we could've done a
lot more, I think.

1104
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:12.712
Blank pages?

1105
01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:17.592
Yeah. That was the last train.

1106
01:17:19.385 --> 01:17:21.471
Something happened
to the last train?

1107
01:17:23.181 --> 01:17:26.785
Yes, it was the ninth train.

1108
01:17:26.809 --> 01:17:32.809
It was our largest group
of 250 children and uh...

1109
01:17:33.024 --> 01:17:36.253
<i>It was the 1st of
September, 1939.</i>

1110
01:17:36.277 --> 01:17:38.547
<i>The same day that
Hitler invaded Poland.</i>

1111
01:17:38.571 --> 01:17:40.281
<i>The very start of the war.</i>

1112
01:18:40.133 --> 01:18:41.610
Hana.

1113
01:18:41.634 --> 01:18:43.278
Trevor!

1114
01:18:43.302 --> 01:18:44.595
Hana!

1115
01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:46.222
Hana!

1116
01:18:51.561 --> 01:18:53.330
That was the end of that.

1117
01:18:53.354 --> 01:18:55.189
Bloody Hitler,
that's all I can say.

1118
01:18:59.652 --> 01:19:02.381
We had hundreds of
foster families waiting,

1119
01:19:02.405 --> 01:19:04.198
ready to welcome them, but

1120
01:19:04.866 --> 01:19:06.325
yeah.

1121
01:19:19.505 --> 01:19:20.506
<i>Merci.</i>

1122
01:19:29.182 --> 01:19:30.242
Take milk?

1123
01:19:30.266 --> 01:19:31.350
Uh, no, thank you.

1124
01:19:32.935 --> 01:19:34.061
Thank you.

1125
01:19:35.688 --> 01:19:37.315
That's wonderful. Thank you.

1126
01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:43.779
I'm sorry.

1127
01:19:46.574 --> 01:19:47.926
Must be very difficult for you

1128
01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:50.387
knowing what happened
to those children.

1129
01:19:50.411 --> 01:19:52.181
Well, I don't know
what happened, do I?

1130
01:19:52.205 --> 01:19:54.391
They were taken off the train,

1131
01:19:54.415 --> 01:19:56.584
returned to their families and

1132
01:19:57.919 --> 01:19:59.587
that was the end of that.

1133
01:20:01.339 --> 01:20:02.900
Surely, I'm almost certain

1134
01:20:02.924 --> 01:20:05.092
that they perished in the camps?

1135
01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:09.096
Hmm.

1136
01:20:52.348 --> 01:20:56.537
Well, you may be right about
those children, Mrs Maxwell.

1137
01:20:56.561 --> 01:21:00.332
But I've learned to keep
my imagination in check.

1138
01:21:00.356 --> 01:21:02.084
Uh, so I can still be of use

1139
01:21:02.108 --> 01:21:03.943
and not go raving mad.

1140
01:21:09.615 --> 01:21:10.866
Mr Winton,

1141
01:21:12.410 --> 01:21:15.138
around 15,000 children

1142
01:21:15.162 --> 01:21:18.934
went into concentration
camps in Czechoslovakia

1143
01:21:18.958 --> 01:21:23.021
and, uh, less than
200 of them survived,

1144
01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:27.925
and you saved 669.

1145
01:21:28.676 --> 01:21:30.052
Oh.

1146
01:21:31.345 --> 01:21:33.448
Ah.

1147
01:21:33.472 --> 01:21:35.867
Anyway, I'd best, uh,
I'd better be going

1148
01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:38.453
because my wife is expecting
me and I don't want...

1149
01:21:38.477 --> 01:21:40.372
I don't want to get
into any trouble,

1150
01:21:40.396 --> 01:21:41.832
if you know what I mean.

1151
01:21:41.856 --> 01:21:43.208
I would like very much

1152
01:21:43.232 --> 01:21:45.651
to hold on to your
scrapbook, if I may.

1153
01:21:47.987 --> 01:21:51.091
- Well, all right.
- And

1154
01:21:51.115 --> 01:21:56.138
with your permission, I would
like to show it to my husband.

1155
01:21:56.162 --> 01:22:00.166
I'm sure he will consider
it a very important story.

1156
01:22:01.125 --> 01:22:04.938
Oh. Well, thank you.

1157
01:22:04.962 --> 01:22:06.297
Thank you.

1158
01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:09.109
As many of you will know,

1159
01:22:09.133 --> 01:22:12.070
our group was founded in 1965

1160
01:22:12.094 --> 01:22:14.573
to encourage friendship
between Maidenhead

1161
01:22:14.597 --> 01:22:17.058
and its twin towns
across Europe.

1162
01:22:19.352 --> 01:22:23.749
We were met at the
airport by Maria Bechtler

1163
01:22:23.773 --> 01:22:26.460
and travelled by coach
to Bad Godesberg,

1164
01:22:26.484 --> 01:22:28.819
where we were given a warm...

1165
01:22:30.571 --> 01:22:31.572
All right?

1166
01:22:34.909 --> 01:22:37.929
Where we were given
a warm <i>Willkommen</i>

1167
01:22:37.953 --> 01:22:39.705
by our hostesses.

1168
01:23:06.023 --> 01:23:09.127
Thank you, darling.
Don't trip, it's heavy.

1169
01:23:09.151 --> 01:23:10.337
Hey, Steve.

1170
01:23:10.361 --> 01:23:11.463
Don't strain yourself, will you?

1171
01:23:11.487 --> 01:23:13.215
- Here. Let me.
- Give me a hand.

1172
01:23:13.239 --> 01:23:14.508
Oh, God.

1173
01:23:14.532 --> 01:23:16.051
I can't get over
all the space, Dad.

1174
01:23:16.075 --> 01:23:18.178
Hey, you could fit
in a playpen in here.

1175
01:23:18.202 --> 01:23:19.721
Oh, no.

1176
01:23:19.745 --> 01:23:22.057
It looks lovely, doesn't it?

1177
01:23:22.081 --> 01:23:24.226
- Doesn't it?
- Yeah. Doesn't it, Dad?

1178
01:23:24.250 --> 01:23:25.394
Yes.

1179
01:23:25.418 --> 01:23:26.687
Don't set it on fire.

1180
01:23:26.711 --> 01:23:27.979
Nicky!

1181
01:23:28.003 --> 01:23:29.356
Well, you did last
year, didn't you?

1182
01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:30.607
- I did not.
- Yes, you did

1183
01:23:30.631 --> 01:23:31.692
- and the year before that.
- No.

1184
01:23:31.716 --> 01:23:32.901
He loves to tease, doesn't he?

1185
01:23:32.925 --> 01:23:34.319
- Huh?
- Oh, it looks lovely.

1186
01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:36.822
Some of them new, aren't they?

1187
01:23:36.846 --> 01:23:38.907
- Well, merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1188
01:23:38.931 --> 01:23:39.931
<i>Merry Christmas. Cheers.</i>

1189
01:23:54.155 --> 01:23:55.298
It's for you.

1190
01:23:55.322 --> 01:23:56.407
Oh.

1191
01:24:04.582 --> 01:24:06.518
Oh, this is interesting.

1192
01:24:06.542 --> 01:24:08.061
What is it?

1193
01:24:08.085 --> 01:24:10.397
It's from the Editor
of the <i>Sunday Mirror.</i>

1194
01:24:10.421 --> 01:24:13.442
"We would very much like
to publish a major article"

1195
01:24:13.466 --> 01:24:16.069
"detailing the
child evacuation."

1196
01:24:16.093 --> 01:24:17.988
But... That's marvellous.

1197
01:24:18.012 --> 01:24:19.698
Oh, yes. It says,

1198
01:24:19.722 --> 01:24:21.724
"With wider publicity in mind."

1199
01:24:23.058 --> 01:24:24.494
"I have been talking"

1200
01:24:24.518 --> 01:24:27.080
"to the BBC Television
program me <i>That's Life!"</i>

1201
01:24:27.104 --> 01:24:28.415
Surely not.

1202
01:24:28.439 --> 01:24:30.709
Yes, they want me
to go in and, uh,

1203
01:24:30.733 --> 01:24:32.502
check the historical accuracy.

1204
01:24:32.526 --> 01:24:35.380
But that's such a silly show.

1205
01:24:35.404 --> 01:24:36.506
- What?
<i>- That's Life!</i>

1206
01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:37.823
It's a very silly show.

1207
01:24:38.741 --> 01:24:39.801
It is.

1208
01:24:39.825 --> 01:24:41.052
Well, it's very
popular, isn't it?

1209
01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:43.078
I mean, a lot of
people watch it.

1210
01:24:44.121 --> 01:24:45.932
Should I come with you?

1211
01:24:45.956 --> 01:24:47.184
Why would you want
to come with me

1212
01:24:47.208 --> 01:24:48.542
if you think it's so silly?

1213
01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:02.097
Oh.

1214
01:25:04.517 --> 01:25:08.789
Hello. Hi, Mr Winton, such
a pleasure to meet you.

1215
01:25:08.813 --> 01:25:10.207
Just gonna take
you through here.

1216
01:25:10.231 --> 01:25:11.315
Yes. This way.

1217
01:25:13.734 --> 01:25:14.961
What exactly am I to do?

1218
01:25:14.985 --> 01:25:16.213
Oh, they're going
to explain all that.

1219
01:25:16.237 --> 01:25:17.964
- Oh.
- It's just through here.

1220
01:25:17.988 --> 01:25:19.114
All right.

1221
01:25:20.825 --> 01:25:21.826
Thank you.

1222
01:25:22.868 --> 01:25:23.869
Thanks.

1223
01:25:30.876 --> 01:25:32.813
Camera six.

1224
01:25:32.837 --> 01:25:34.505
Can you come from
the other side?

1225
01:25:36.006 --> 01:25:38.109
Thank you.

1226
01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:39.844
Thirty seconds to on air.

1227
01:25:44.890 --> 01:25:48.495
Okay, and you are just here.

1228
01:25:48.519 --> 01:25:51.081
- Couldn't I sit farther back?
- I'm afraid not.

1229
01:25:51.105 --> 01:25:52.457
Oh, I'd rather be backstage.

1230
01:25:52.481 --> 01:25:53.875
I'm... I'm really, really sorry.

1231
01:25:53.899 --> 01:25:55.126
It's just they told
me to put you here

1232
01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:56.419
and we're running out of time.

1233
01:25:56.443 --> 01:25:57.443
All right.

1234
01:26:07.913 --> 01:26:09.164
Who's that?

1235
01:26:27.933 --> 01:26:29.894
Hello. Good evening.

1236
01:26:37.985 --> 01:26:40.130
<i>And would you want to be
treated by this dentist</i>

1237
01:26:40.154 --> 01:26:43.782
<i>in Bath who goes by
the name Mr F Illing?</i>

1238
01:26:46.702 --> 01:26:47.703
<i>Esther.</i>

1239
01:26:49.163 --> 01:26:52.267
Now, an extraordinary
story has come to light

1240
01:26:52.291 --> 01:26:54.060
about a young man who,

1241
01:26:54.084 --> 01:26:56.605
many years ago, visited Prague,

1242
01:26:56.629 --> 01:27:00.775
and what he found there
was a terrible situation.

1243
01:27:00.799 --> 01:27:02.944
Thousands of refugees stranded,

1244
01:27:02.968 --> 01:27:05.363
living in desperate conditions,

1245
01:27:05.387 --> 01:27:09.034
<i>and at the mercy of
Hitler's imminent invasion.</i>

1246
01:27:09.058 --> 01:27:12.245
<i>This young man, whose
name was Nicholas Winton,</i>

1247
01:27:12.269 --> 01:27:14.915
<i>decided that something
had to be done.</i>

1248
01:27:14.939 --> 01:27:19.526
And so he managed to
rescue 669 children.

1249
01:27:20.694 --> 01:27:22.112
This is his scrapbook.

1250
01:27:23.447 --> 01:27:28.202
All sorts of
fascinating photographs.

1251
01:27:29.411 --> 01:27:31.288
Perhaps you can see...

1252
01:27:32.831 --> 01:27:35.644
Here's a photograph of
Nicholas Winton himself,

1253
01:27:35.668 --> 01:27:38.730
with one of the
children he rescued.

1254
01:27:38.754 --> 01:27:42.817
But at the very back, is a list

1255
01:27:42.841 --> 01:27:44.402
of all the children

1256
01:27:44.426 --> 01:27:46.237
<i>that he rescued.</i>

1257
01:27:46.261 --> 01:27:49.866
<i>Here is Vera Diamantova,
now Vera Gissing.</i>

1258
01:27:49.890 --> 01:27:52.911
We found her name on his list.

1259
01:27:52.935 --> 01:27:56.247
And Vera is here with
us tonight. Hello, Vera.

1260
01:27:56.271 --> 01:27:57.666
Hello. Now, I should tell

1261
01:27:57.690 --> 01:27:59.334
you that you are, in
fact, sitting next

1262
01:27:59.358 --> 01:28:01.443
to Mr Nicholas Winton.

1263
01:28:02.945 --> 01:28:03.988
Hello.

1264
01:28:06.073 --> 01:28:08.742
Hello.

1265
01:28:17.084 --> 01:28:18.085
Thank you.

1266
01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:34.995
I was reunited with my sister

1267
01:28:35.019 --> 01:28:36.913
a few years later.

1268
01:28:36.937 --> 01:28:38.665
And your parents?

1269
01:28:38.689 --> 01:28:42.127
My father was
tortured, in Terezin.

1270
01:28:42.151 --> 01:28:43.211
Mm-hmm.

1271
01:28:43.235 --> 01:28:45.821
And then sent to Auschwitz.

1272
01:28:48.198 --> 01:28:50.593
And then on to
another lab our camp.

1273
01:28:50.617 --> 01:28:52.137
Ah.

1274
01:28:52.161 --> 01:28:53.513
A fellow prisoner told me

1275
01:28:53.537 --> 01:28:56.999
he thought he'd been
shot on the Death March.

1276
01:28:58.709 --> 01:28:59.710
Hmm.

1277
01:29:01.128 --> 01:29:03.964
My mother, um, died of typhus.

1278
01:29:05.549 --> 01:29:07.926
- So sorry.
- Contracted at Belsen.

1279
01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:11.865
But she knew that we were safe.

1280
01:29:11.889 --> 01:29:13.682
For a mother, that
is everything.

1281
01:29:16.727 --> 01:29:20.898
And, um, my cousins,
Honza and Tommy

1282
01:29:22.524 --> 01:29:24.234
were on the last train.

1283
01:29:26.111 --> 01:29:27.881
Yeah.

1284
01:29:27.905 --> 01:29:30.157
Though I never saw
them again, of course.

1285
01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:02.981
Nicky.

1286
01:30:14.618 --> 01:30:15.786
Nicky.

1287
01:30:52.656 --> 01:30:53.740
I'm sorry.

1288
01:31:06.461 --> 01:31:08.731
I'm sorry. Very sorry.

1289
01:31:08.755 --> 01:31:09.840
Don't.

1290
01:31:16.763 --> 01:31:17.764
I'll get it.

1291
01:31:23.061 --> 01:31:24.914
Nicky! You've not
called me back.

1292
01:31:24.938 --> 01:31:26.583
I left messages!

1293
01:31:26.607 --> 01:31:29.419
- Doesn't it follow that I don't want to talk to you?
- Oh, come on, come on, let me do a piece.

1294
01:31:29.443 --> 01:31:30.753
No, thanks.

1295
01:31:30.777 --> 01:31:32.881
Come on. It's such a
brilliant story, Nicky.

1296
01:31:32.905 --> 01:31:37.010
You're a hero. Nicky,
please. Please.

1297
01:31:37.034 --> 01:31:38.720
What... It's not about me.

1298
01:31:38.744 --> 01:31:39.804
Nicky, come on,

1299
01:31:39.828 --> 01:31:40.913
give me a chance.

1300
01:31:43.373 --> 01:31:44.934
Maidenhead, 3310.

1301
01:31:44.958 --> 01:31:46.477
<i>Hello, is Mister
Winton there, please?</i>

1302
01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:49.606
No, he's not available.
Can I ask who's calling?

1303
01:31:49.630 --> 01:31:52.525
<i>This is Katinka Blackford
from</i> That's Life!

1304
01:31:52.549 --> 01:31:54.593
Oh. Oh, I see.

1305
01:31:56.428 --> 01:31:59.699
Two more children, huh?

1306
01:31:59.723 --> 01:32:04.037
They... They phoned in
after last week's show.

1307
01:32:04.061 --> 01:32:06.539
Yeah.

1308
01:32:06.563 --> 01:32:10.108
They so desperately
want to meet you.

1309
01:32:14.613 --> 01:32:16.323
You don't have to do it.

1310
01:32:17.574 --> 01:32:18.575
Don't I?

1311
01:32:20.702 --> 01:32:23.413
I asked them to send the
children's details to us.

1312
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:26.583
I won't have you ambushed again.

1313
01:32:39.012 --> 01:32:40.698
Milena...

1314
01:32:40.722 --> 01:32:43.117
Well, goodness. This girl's
done very well for herself.

1315
01:32:43.141 --> 01:32:44.661
Yeah.

1316
01:32:44.685 --> 01:32:46.454
Milena is now Lady
Grenfell Baines.

1317
01:32:46.478 --> 01:32:47.997
Oh.

1318
01:32:48.021 --> 01:32:50.899
All right.

1319
01:32:55.445 --> 01:32:58.258
Who's that? Hanus.

1320
01:32:58.282 --> 01:33:00.718
Perhaps it's too much.
Perhaps you've done enough.

1321
01:33:00.742 --> 01:33:01.952
No, I...

1322
01:33:03.203 --> 01:33:05.723
I started the whole thing, so...

1323
01:33:05.747 --> 01:33:07.165
I have to finish it.

1324
01:33:10.252 --> 01:33:13.982
Last week was incredible
for us here at <i>That's Life!</i>

1325
01:33:14.006 --> 01:33:17.485
We told a story that touched
the hearts of so many people.

1326
01:33:17.509 --> 01:33:20.905
We've been overwhelmed
by the response.

1327
01:33:20.929 --> 01:33:23.741
One of the people who was
very affected last week

1328
01:33:23.765 --> 01:33:26.077
is with us here tonight.

1329
01:33:26.101 --> 01:33:30.039
Milena Fleischmann, now
Lady Grenfell Baines,

1330
01:33:30.063 --> 01:33:34.127
was also one of the children
that Nicholas Winton rescued.

1331
01:33:34.151 --> 01:33:38.131
Milena, I understand you
still have the name tag

1332
01:33:38.155 --> 01:33:39.507
that you wore around your neck

1333
01:33:39.531 --> 01:33:42.427
when you arrived here
as a little girl.

1334
01:33:42.451 --> 01:33:45.763
Yes, I wore this around my neck

1335
01:33:45.787 --> 01:33:49.309
and this is the actual pass

1336
01:33:49.333 --> 01:33:52.520
we were given to
come to England.

1337
01:33:52.544 --> 01:33:55.630
So, I am one of the
children that you saved.

1338
01:34:01.595 --> 01:34:04.741
Now, Mr Winton, having
introduced you to Milena,

1339
01:34:04.765 --> 01:34:07.910
there's somebody else that
we'd like to tell you about.

1340
01:34:07.934 --> 01:34:12.272
Hanus Schnabel was only
11 when he came over here.

1341
01:34:13.732 --> 01:34:14.900
We have his passport

1342
01:34:16.651 --> 01:34:19.714
with all the official
stamps in it.

1343
01:34:19.738 --> 01:34:22.216
I don't know
whether you can see,

1344
01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:24.761
but this is how he got here.

1345
01:34:24.785 --> 01:34:26.262
And he told us...

1346
01:34:26.286 --> 01:34:28.598
"I don't know how my
rescue was arranged.

1347
01:34:28.622 --> 01:34:31.225
"I had no idea when I left
my parents at Prague station

1348
01:34:31.249 --> 01:34:33.102
"that I would never
see them again.

1349
01:34:33.126 --> 01:34:35.104
"My older brother
Franta was supposed

1350
01:34:35.128 --> 01:34:36.814
"to come here by
train in September,

1351
01:34:36.838 --> 01:34:39.692
"but war broke out and I
never saw him again either.

1352
01:34:39.716 --> 01:34:42.236
"I hoped all through the
war that they would survive,

1353
01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:45.198
"but they were gassed
in a concentration camp.

1354
01:34:45.222 --> 01:34:47.158
"I've often wondered
who was responsible"

1355
01:34:47.182 --> 01:34:48.910
"for organising my rescue."

1356
01:34:48.934 --> 01:34:50.328
"I would dearly
love to meet him"

1357
01:34:50.352 --> 01:34:52.330
"and thank him for
helping us children"

1358
01:34:52.354 --> 01:34:54.916
"without any hope
of acknowledgement."

1359
01:34:54.940 --> 01:34:58.544
Hanus' name is on
Mr Winton's list.

1360
01:34:58.568 --> 01:35:01.196
And Hanus is here
with us tonight.

1361
01:35:04.783 --> 01:35:05.968
Oh.

1362
01:35:05.992 --> 01:35:07.077
Thank you.

1363
01:35:10.414 --> 01:35:12.058
Now, I don't want to rush you.

1364
01:35:12.082 --> 01:35:14.644
I know you've waited a
long time for this moment,

1365
01:35:14.668 --> 01:35:17.129
but you'll be able to
talk to Hanus later.

1366
01:35:18.755 --> 01:35:21.925
However, our evening
isn't quite over.

1367
01:35:26.012 --> 01:35:29.450
Can I ask, is there anyone
in the audience tonight

1368
01:35:29.474 --> 01:35:32.018
who owes their life
to Nicholas Winton?

1369
01:35:33.437 --> 01:35:35.564
If so, could you
stand up, please?

1370
01:35:54.791 --> 01:35:57.085
Mr Winton, would you
like to turn around?

1371
01:36:16.438 --> 01:36:17.999
You can meet all of these people

1372
01:36:18.023 --> 01:36:21.002
properly after the program me.

1373
01:36:21.026 --> 01:36:26.007
In the meantime, Mr Winton,
on behalf of all of them,

1374
01:36:26.031 --> 01:36:27.908
thank you very much indeed.

1375
01:38:31.906 --> 01:38:33.241
See Grandpa?

1376
01:38:40.874 --> 01:38:43.477
- Hello. Hello, Vera. Come in.
- Oh, Nicky.

1377
01:38:43.501 --> 01:38:45.605
Hello.

1378
01:38:45.629 --> 01:38:48.441
- Good, go through. Hello.
- Hi.

1379
01:38:48.465 --> 01:38:50.276
What's your name? Hi,

1380
01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:52.111
I'm Vera's daughter. Hello.

1381
01:38:52.135 --> 01:38:53.404
Nice to meet you.
Hello. Come through.

1382
01:38:53.428 --> 01:38:54.864
This is so beautiful.

1383
01:38:54.888 --> 01:38:56.240
Oh, this is Nicola.

1384
01:38:56.264 --> 01:38:57.742
- Oh, hello. Hello.
- My daughter.

1385
01:38:57.766 --> 01:38:59.368
And this is Rebecca,
my little grandchild.

1386
01:38:59.392 --> 01:39:00.953
Wow. Hello. Say, "Hello."

1387
01:39:00.977 --> 01:39:02.913
Hi. So, you do have a pool.

1388
01:39:02.937 --> 01:39:04.022
We do have a pool.

1389
01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:08.193
Nicky, turn the music down
a little bit, darling.

1390
01:39:12.947 --> 01:39:14.884
Hello, young man. Hello.

1391
01:39:14.908 --> 01:39:16.802
Right, be careful, though.

1392
01:39:16.826 --> 01:39:17.887
Not too fast.

1393
01:39:17.911 --> 01:39:19.930
Oh, it's beautiful, isn't it?

1394
01:39:19.954 --> 01:39:21.390
Oh, my goodness.

1395
01:39:21.414 --> 01:39:22.725
Darling, you must be
really careful here.

1396
01:39:22.749 --> 01:39:25.519
Oh, you have a
lovely pool, Nicky.

1397
01:39:25.543 --> 01:39:27.128
Yeah. I like to swim.

1398
01:39:30.298 --> 01:39:31.508
- You remember?
- Mm.

1399
01:39:34.135 --> 01:39:35.237
You all got towels?
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1400
01:39:35.261 --> 01:39:37.281
Can we go in? Yes!

1401
01:39:37.305 --> 01:39:39.033
What's the temperature like?

1402
01:39:39.057 --> 01:39:40.642
It's all right if
you're a penguin.

1403
01:39:42.686 --> 01:39:44.872
Let's have a little
go, shall we?

1404
01:39:44.896 --> 01:39:47.524
Oh. Gotcha!

1405
01:39:48.191 --> 01:39:49.859
Oh!

1406
01:39:55.448 --> 01:39:57.575
Isn't that lovely.
