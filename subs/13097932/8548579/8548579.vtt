00:02:52.332 --> 00:02:54.167
Home.

00:02:54.167 --> 00:02:55.377
<i>Although it'll start off</i>

3
00:02:55.377 --> 00:02:57.295
<i>with some sunshine
in the morning,</i>

4
00:02:57.295 --> 00:02:58.880
<i>you'll find cloud coming
along in the afternoon.</i>

5
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.924
<i>That's all, have a lovely day.</i>

6
00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:07.806
BBC News, <i>and good day.</i>

7
00:03:07.806 --> 00:03:11.017
<i>Just 24 hours after what many
are calling Black Monday,</i>

8
00:03:11.017 --> 00:03:14.646
<i>the FTSE 100 Index
lost another 250 points,</i>

9
00:03:14.646 --> 00:03:16.815
<i>leaving businesses
and investors reeling.</i>

10
00:03:16.815 --> 00:03:19.359
Well, that's what happens
when you deregulate.

11
00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.236
<i>Global markets
have rallied somewhat</i>

12
00:03:21.236 --> 00:03:23.947
<i>after yesterday's losses
which saw Wall Street close</i>

13
00:03:23.947 --> 00:03:27.409
<i>- a full 508 points down.</i>
- Idiots.

14
00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:29.452
<i>Supporters
and families of Tamil migrants</i>

15
00:03:29.452 --> 00:03:32.330
<i>have gathered outside a London

16
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.457
<i>to protest against
the government's plan</i>

17
00:03:34.457 --> 00:03:36.042

18
00:03:36.042 --> 00:03:37.752
<i>We came here

19
00:03:37.752 --> 00:03:39.588
<i>our lives are in danger.</i>

20
00:03:39.588 --> 00:03:42.007
<i>We came to keep
our children safe.</i>

21
00:03:42.007 --> 00:03:43.675
<i>A Home Office

22
00:03:43.675 --> 00:03:46.428
<i>Britain's humanitarian record
as outstanding.</i>

23
00:03:46.428 --> 00:03:48.138
<i>- We'll have a report.</i>

24
00:03:55.812 --> 00:03:57.230
Hello, darling.

25
00:04:00.025 --> 00:04:01.735
I was worried this would be...

26
00:04:01.735 --> 00:04:03.570
- Huh?
- ...burnt on top.

27
00:04:11.161 --> 00:04:12.412
You all right?

28
00:04:12.412 --> 00:04:14.956
What?
- What's that?

29
00:04:14.956 --> 00:04:18.835
Well, what does it look like?
It's a button.

30
00:04:18.835 --> 00:04:21.087
- A button?
- Yes.

31
00:04:21.087 --> 00:04:24.257
Somebody just, uh,
put it in the tin.

32
00:04:24.257 --> 00:04:27.928
Honestly. People.

33
00:04:27.928 --> 00:04:30.430
Well, you never know
when it may come in handy.

34
00:04:33.016 --> 00:04:34.017
Hm.

35
00:04:52.118 --> 00:04:53.119
Oh.

36
00:04:55.872 --> 00:04:57.749
Oh, hello.
What have you got now?

37
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.502
Oh, it's a typewriter.

38
00:05:00.502 --> 00:05:03.505
I know what it is,
but you've already got one.

39
00:05:03.505 --> 00:05:06.591
I know. It's not for me.
It's, um...

40
00:05:06.591 --> 00:05:09.386
They don't need it anymore
at the day centre,

41
00:05:09.386 --> 00:05:10.470
so I thought it would be
all right

42
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.055
for the new care home.

43
00:05:12.055 --> 00:05:15.225
And, uh, we can hang on to it
in the meanwhile.

44
00:05:15.225 --> 00:05:16.643
- No.
- Huh?

45
00:05:16.643 --> 00:05:18.144
No.

46
00:05:18.144 --> 00:05:21.564
Why? Uh, I've also got
a desk outside.

47
00:05:21.564 --> 00:05:23.984
- What? Where?
- Well, I haven't
brought it in yet but...

48
00:05:23.984 --> 00:05:26.069
- Oh, Nicky. It's too much.
- What?

49
00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:28.613
How will we fit everyone in
at Christmas?

50
00:05:28.613 --> 00:05:29.990
I don't know.

51
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.157
They'll just have to shove up,
won't they?

52
00:05:31.157 --> 00:05:32.659
Your daughter is
seven months pregnant.

53
00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:35.078
- I know.
- She cannot "shove up".

54
00:05:35.078 --> 00:05:36.538
All right.

55
00:05:36.538 --> 00:05:38.415
Well, I'll move it all
to the study then.

56
00:05:38.415 --> 00:05:40.166
Oh, the study.

57
00:05:40.166 --> 00:05:42.460
I bet you have plenty
of room in the study.

58
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.462
- God.
- Let's go and check the study.

59
00:05:46.256 --> 00:05:47.841
- Oh, Nicky.
Out.

60
00:05:48.883 --> 00:05:51.136
Do you still need all this?

61
00:05:51.136 --> 00:05:53.555
Yes. Why?

62
00:05:53.555 --> 00:05:57.267
What... What's in
all these drawers?

63
00:05:57.267 --> 00:05:59.352
- Well, everything I think.
Darling.

64
00:06:02.063 --> 00:06:03.982
A domino, a biscuit

65
00:06:05.984 --> 00:06:08.445
and how many rubber bands
does one man need?

66
00:06:08.445 --> 00:06:11.031
I don't know.
I've never asked the question.

67
00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.870
And you've got to find
the right home for that.

68
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.205
Somewhere it will
be appreciated.

69
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.209
Please, Nicky,

70
00:06:24.294 --> 00:06:26.129
you have to let go.

71
00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:27.756
For your own sake.

72
00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:34.823
Oh, I'm so looking forward
to it.

73
00:07:34.823 --> 00:07:36.699
<i>Do you want me
to stay with him?</i>

74
00:07:36.699 --> 00:07:39.828
No, no. No, he'll be fine.

75
00:07:39.828 --> 00:07:41.538
<i>Okay, well,
maybe I'll just call him.</i>

76
00:07:41.538 --> 00:07:46.292
Yes. Yes.
He's a grown man.

77
00:07:49.421 --> 00:07:51.047
You don't have to wave me off.

78
00:07:51.047 --> 00:07:53.133
Of course I'm going
to wave you off.

79
00:07:53.133 --> 00:07:54.259
Everyone's here.

80
00:07:55.009 --> 00:07:56.010
Ah.

81
00:08:03.143 --> 00:08:04.310
Huh.

82
00:08:12.694 --> 00:08:14.779
Hm.

83
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.157
Nicky,

84
00:08:17.157 --> 00:08:18.616
don't let yourself get...

85
00:08:18.616 --> 00:08:19.742
What?

86
00:08:19.742 --> 00:08:21.828
How you get.

87
00:08:21.828 --> 00:08:24.581
- I won't. Of course I won't.

88
00:08:24.581 --> 00:08:26.124
You have a wonderful time.

89
00:09:03.244 --> 00:09:05.538
- Home.
Ah, Nicky.

90
00:09:05.538 --> 00:09:07.332
- You missed Martin.
- Damn.

91
00:09:08.708 --> 00:09:10.043
Two hearts. Kings.

92
00:09:10.043 --> 00:09:12.462
Uh, hello. Did Martin say
if he'd call back?

93
00:09:12.462 --> 00:09:14.172
Seven o'clock sharp.

94
00:09:14.172 --> 00:09:16.466
Oh.

95
00:09:16.466 --> 00:09:18.635
Thank you, mother.
You're very welcome, son.

96
00:09:20.261 --> 00:09:22.639
Isn't Martin the chap
he was supposed
to be going skiing with?

97
00:09:22.639 --> 00:09:26.100
Yes. But Martin is
in Prague now,

98
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.685
helping refugees.

99
00:09:27.685 --> 00:09:29.187
Prague?

100
00:09:29.187 --> 00:09:30.772
Well, precisely.

101
00:09:34.484 --> 00:09:36.069
- Hello?
<i>It's Martin.</i>

102
00:09:36.069 --> 00:09:37.403
<i>- Can you hear me? Nicky?</i>
- I... I can hear you.

103
00:09:37.403 --> 00:09:38.947
<i>- It's a terrible line.</i>
- I can hear you.

104
00:09:38.947 --> 00:09:40.323
<i>Listen, I'm not sure
you should come.</i>

105
00:09:40.323 --> 00:09:42.492
No, it's all arranged.
I have my ticket.

106
00:09:42.492 --> 00:09:44.369
<i>I have
to leave Prague tonight.</i>

107
00:09:44.369 --> 00:09:47.830
<i>I'll have a man called
Trevor Chadwick meet you.</i>

108
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.750
<i>I'm so sorry.
It's just such a mess here.</i>

109
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:51.751
Happy Christmas.

110
00:09:57.799 --> 00:09:59.300
So, you going?

111
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.511
I am, yes.

112
00:10:04.931 --> 00:10:08.017
Everyone in Prague
is trying to get out.

113
00:10:08.017 --> 00:10:10.311
My son is trying to get in.

114
00:10:10.311 --> 00:10:12.939
Did you speak to Martin?

115
00:10:12.939 --> 00:10:16.859
I did. Uh, turns out
he's not gonna be there.

116
00:10:16.859 --> 00:10:19.028
He's escorting some refugees
out of the country

117
00:10:19.028 --> 00:10:21.030
and then he's heading
back home to London.

118
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:23.283
- Nicky.
- Look, I have to do something.

119
00:10:23.283 --> 00:10:25.201
It... Is...

120
00:10:25.201 --> 00:10:27.620
And you, of all people,
should understand that.

121
00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:28.955
Isn't that what you taught me?

122
00:10:28.955 --> 00:10:30.999
Well, I can't just sit here
reading about it.

123
00:10:30.999 --> 00:10:32.458
These people need help.

124
00:10:32.458 --> 00:10:35.837
I was never in doubt
that the cause was just,

125
00:10:35.837 --> 00:10:37.297
only whether Prague is safe.

126
00:10:37.297 --> 00:10:38.464
It's only a week.

127
00:10:38.464 --> 00:10:40.758
Uh, I'll be back
before you even miss me.

128
00:10:40.758 --> 00:10:43.052
Nicky, it's not a joke.

129
00:10:43.052 --> 00:10:44.345
I know, I know.

130
00:10:45.346 --> 00:10:46.598
I'm sorry, but I...

131
00:10:48.349 --> 00:10:49.559
I have to go.

132
00:11:24.927 --> 00:11:25.928
Here we are.

133
00:11:29.265 --> 00:11:30.850
Mr Chadwick.
- This is Mr Winton.

134
00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:32.560
Evening.
- Now, don't go giving him

135
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.145
a better room than me.

136
00:11:34.145 --> 00:11:36.105
All our rooms are the best
rooms, Mr Chadwick.

137
00:11:36.105 --> 00:11:37.690
Rudi takes good care of us.

138
00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:41.486
Welcome. And Miss Warriner
is in the bar.

139
00:11:43.529 --> 00:11:46.115
Oh, that's Doreen

140
00:11:46.115 --> 00:11:47.950
with one of our refugees.

141
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:50.912
Over here.

142
00:11:54.248 --> 00:11:55.583
Her husband
was picked up

143
00:11:55.583 --> 00:11:57.168
on the street this morning.

144
00:11:58.711 --> 00:12:00.213
Picked up by?

145
00:12:00.213 --> 00:12:03.466
Doreen thinks Nazi spies
doing Hitler's dirty work.

146
00:12:03.466 --> 00:12:05.510
What will happen?
To him, I mean.

147
00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:08.554
Ah, thank you, thank you.

148
00:12:08.554 --> 00:12:09.931
He'll be dumped somewhere.

149
00:12:09.931 --> 00:12:11.307
Maybe alive,

150
00:12:12.141 --> 00:12:14.143
but probably not.

151
00:12:16.229 --> 00:12:17.897
You're Martin's
friend, the stockbroker.

152
00:12:17.897 --> 00:12:21.901
- Nicky. And you must be, uh...
- Unbelievably angry.

153
00:12:21.901 --> 00:12:23.361
So?
We've managed to get

154
00:12:23.361 --> 00:12:24.779
Monika into a safe house
for the night

155
00:12:24.779 --> 00:12:26.489
and her daughter
on the plane out tomorrow.

156
00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.243
Well,
that's something.

157
00:12:30.243 --> 00:12:32.995
So, Martin says you know
your way around a desk.

158
00:12:32.995 --> 00:12:34.414
That's quite an accolade.

159
00:12:34.414 --> 00:12:36.791
It is here.
Paperwork's everything.

160
00:12:40.461 --> 00:12:42.130
And can
I just ask, um,

161
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.590
why... why was that woman's
husband taken?

162
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:46.384
He ran a newspaper in Germany.

163
00:12:46.384 --> 00:12:48.177
Spoke out against the Nazis.

164
00:12:48.177 --> 00:12:49.804
When it got too dangerous,

165
00:12:49.804 --> 00:12:51.222
they escaped over the border
into Czechoslovakia.

166
00:12:51.222 --> 00:12:52.557
- The Sudetenland.
- Where they thought

167
00:12:52.557 --> 00:12:53.933
they'd be safe.

168
00:12:53.933 --> 00:12:55.643
And so they fled
to Prague.

169
00:12:57.478 --> 00:12:58.688
All right, I've got
a lot to do.

170
00:12:58.688 --> 00:12:59.772
Taking supplies
to the camps tomorrow.

171
00:12:59.772 --> 00:13:01.149
I could use your help.

172
00:13:06.362 --> 00:13:08.740
Can I ask what
brought you out here?

173
00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:12.869
I came 10 years ago
for a study trip.

174
00:13:12.869 --> 00:13:16.956
I just... just love the place,
love the people.

175
00:13:16.956 --> 00:13:19.876
Now they're in trouble.
So I came back.

176
00:13:29.802 --> 00:13:32.054
Are they all
from the Sudetenland?

177
00:13:32.054 --> 00:13:33.765
Mostly.

178
00:13:33.765 --> 00:13:38.478
Some from Austria and Germany
who fled there first.

179
00:13:38.478 --> 00:13:41.230
Drive an hour north of here,
towards the German border,

180
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:42.648
you'll see the towns
they ran from

181
00:13:42.648 --> 00:13:44.066
hung with Nazi flags.

182
00:13:52.533 --> 00:13:54.327
Dear God.

183
00:13:54.327 --> 00:13:56.579
I know. And there are
thousands more like this.

184
00:14:08.549 --> 00:14:10.968
<i>Ahoj,</i> Hana.
This is Nicholas Winton.

185
00:14:10.968 --> 00:14:12.220
He's here to help out.

186
00:14:13.137 --> 00:14:14.764
Oh.

187
00:14:14.764 --> 00:14:17.058
Hana Hejdukova. Liaison
officer for Czech refugees.

188
00:14:17.058 --> 00:14:18.810
- Hello.
- Your first time

189
00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:22.104
- in Czechoslovakia?
- Yes, yes, it... Yes, it is.

190
00:14:22.104 --> 00:14:24.732
Shame you didn't come sooner.
When there was more of it.

191
00:14:24.732 --> 00:14:25.942
Hana.

192
00:14:27.819 --> 00:14:30.196
Um, can you get the others?

193
00:14:30.196 --> 00:14:32.990
Oh, there we go.

194
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:34.909
So, you've managed
to get doctors out to them?

195
00:14:34.909 --> 00:14:38.079
Oh, plenty
of doctors already here.

196
00:14:38.079 --> 00:14:40.122
Lots of these children grew up
thinking the worst thing

197
00:14:40.122 --> 00:14:42.500
that was ever gonna happen
to them was piano practice.

198
00:14:45.837 --> 00:14:46.838
Nicky.

199
00:16:15.885 --> 00:16:17.094
- Hello.

200
00:16:21.474 --> 00:16:22.850
I'm so... I'm sorry,

201
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:24.101
I haven't got anything.

202
00:16:25.603 --> 00:16:26.771
Oh, wait,

203
00:16:27.688 --> 00:16:29.440
now hold on a moment.

204
00:16:31.442 --> 00:16:32.902
- Chocolate.

205
00:16:35.112 --> 00:16:37.281
Here we go.

206
00:16:37.281 --> 00:16:38.866
Oh, yes,

207
00:16:38.866 --> 00:16:41.118
of course you'd like some
as well.

208
00:16:41.118 --> 00:16:43.412
- There we go.

209
00:16:43.412 --> 00:16:44.914
Oh.

210
00:16:44.914 --> 00:16:46.707
Let's see
how far we go.

211
00:16:46.707 --> 00:16:48.793
Oh, crikey.

212
00:16:48.793 --> 00:16:50.127
There's only a tiny bit.

213
00:16:50.127 --> 00:16:51.921
- And little bit for you.

214
00:16:51.921 --> 00:16:53.005
Little bit for you.

215
00:16:54.715 --> 00:16:56.258
That's it.
That's the last of it.

216
00:16:56.258 --> 00:16:58.135
- There you go.

217
00:17:01.764 --> 00:17:06.394
I'm sorry. I'll, um...
I'll bring more, another day.

218
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:10.564
<i>Foto, foto.</i>

219
00:17:14.276 --> 00:17:15.861
Yes, yes. It's a good idea.

220
00:17:16.821 --> 00:17:18.823
What's your name?

221
00:17:18.823 --> 00:17:20.282
- I'm Nicky.

222
00:17:20.282 --> 00:17:21.367
Can you say, "Nicky"?

223
00:17:23.536 --> 00:17:25.788
- There we go.

224
00:17:34.505 --> 00:17:36.799
How will these children
survive the winter?

225
00:17:36.799 --> 00:17:39.135
Well, they probably won't.

226
00:17:39.135 --> 00:17:41.012
And there are
a dozen more places like this.

227
00:17:43.097 --> 00:17:45.182
Surely, they should be
the priority,

228
00:17:45.182 --> 00:17:47.101
the children, families.

229
00:17:47.101 --> 00:17:49.437
My remit is
to rescue politicals

230
00:17:49.437 --> 00:17:51.272
at imminent risk of arrest.

231
00:17:51.272 --> 00:17:53.065
And I've hardly the money
or manpower for that.

232
00:17:53.065 --> 00:17:54.066
What about
the British government trains?

233
00:17:54.066 --> 00:17:55.735
The Kindertransport?

234
00:17:55.735 --> 00:17:57.737
It's only for children leaving
Germany and Austria.

235
00:17:57.737 --> 00:17:59.321
Not from Czechoslovakia.

236
00:17:59.321 --> 00:18:01.365
Unfortunately, His Majesty's
government refuses

237
00:18:01.365 --> 00:18:03.200
to believe these people
are in danger.

238
00:18:19.008 --> 00:18:20.634
How many
children are we talking about?

239
00:18:20.634 --> 00:18:22.053
Oh, well, we don't know.
That's part of the problem.

240
00:18:22.053 --> 00:18:25.598
Thousands. There's refugees
all over the city.

241
00:18:25.598 --> 00:18:27.141
Jewish people, especially.

242
00:18:27.141 --> 00:18:28.267
But anyone, really,
who doesn't fit

243
00:18:28.267 --> 00:18:29.602
into Hitler's master race.

244
00:18:29.602 --> 00:18:30.978
They're banned from travel

245
00:18:30.978 --> 00:18:32.646
and the UK's
refusing entry visas

246
00:18:32.646 --> 00:18:35.441
to families trying to get out.
It's chaos.

247
00:18:35.441 --> 00:18:37.276
Welcome to
the British Committee

248
00:18:37.276 --> 00:18:39.403
for Refugees
from Czechoslovakia.

249
00:18:39.403 --> 00:18:41.697
Hana, get him those files,
would you?

250
00:18:41.697 --> 00:18:43.449
That's quite a filing system.

251
00:18:43.449 --> 00:18:46.452
Yes. Well,
if the Germans
send in their spies,

252
00:18:46.452 --> 00:18:48.537
at least they won't be able
to find anything.

253
00:18:48.537 --> 00:18:50.372
- In any case,

254
00:18:50.372 --> 00:18:51.874
you're the one who's supposed
to be good with paperwork.

255
00:18:51.874 --> 00:18:52.958
This is you.

256
00:18:58.255 --> 00:19:00.674
Uh, yes, this report

257
00:19:00.674 --> 00:19:02.802
details
the political activists

258
00:19:02.802 --> 00:19:04.178
in and around Prague.

259
00:19:06.972 --> 00:19:09.225
What's this?

260
00:19:09.225 --> 00:19:12.645
The Führer's travel plans
in black and white.

261
00:19:12.645 --> 00:19:14.605
He's got his sights set
on half of Europe.

262
00:19:14.605 --> 00:19:16.107
It's just a question of when.

263
00:19:17.441 --> 00:19:18.859
Who else has seen it?

264
00:19:18.859 --> 00:19:20.069
Half of Prague, I imagine.

265
00:19:22.279 --> 00:19:24.365
Meant to intimidate.

266
00:19:24.365 --> 00:19:26.575
Hitler's never made any secret
of his ambitions.

267
00:19:26.575 --> 00:19:28.160
The allies banked
on appeasing him

268
00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.912
with a fat slice
of this country.

269
00:19:29.912 --> 00:19:31.455
Now the vicious shit's just
gonna take the rest of it.

270
00:19:32.873 --> 00:19:35.543
The children.
We have to move them.

271
00:19:35.543 --> 00:19:37.545
Says the man
who arrived yesterday.

272
00:19:37.545 --> 00:19:39.964
Well, I'm not suggesting
it's gonna be easy.

273
00:19:39.964 --> 00:19:44.301
A mass transit of children
without money or... or visas?

274
00:19:44.301 --> 00:19:46.053
Well, we'll find a way.

275
00:19:46.053 --> 00:19:49.348
How long are you here for?
A week?

276
00:19:49.348 --> 00:19:50.641
And then you're back
to your bank.

277
00:19:50.641 --> 00:19:51.976
Can we please put that aside
for now?

278
00:19:51.976 --> 00:19:54.270
Well, can we please
be realistic?

279
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:55.938
We can't give
these people false hope.

280
00:19:55.938 --> 00:20:00.276
Look, we... we have to believe
that this might be possible.

281
00:20:00.276 --> 00:20:02.153
Look...

282
00:20:02.153 --> 00:20:04.905
Let me try. Let... Let...
Let me

283
00:20:04.905 --> 00:20:06.991
find out the scale
of the problem.

284
00:20:06.991 --> 00:20:11.120
You know, how many children,
names and ages,

285
00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.329
where they're living.

286
00:20:13.956 --> 00:20:15.207
There must be
existing information.

287
00:20:18.836 --> 00:20:22.006
Well, the vulnerable groups,
they do have lists.

288
00:20:22.006 --> 00:20:25.509
But, they are scared
to share them.

289
00:20:25.509 --> 00:20:28.470
Well, then, we need
to earn their trust.

290
00:20:29.471 --> 00:20:31.473
We need those lists.

291
00:20:31.473 --> 00:20:32.808
So, we have to persuade them.

292
00:20:34.727 --> 00:20:36.353
Please, let me try.

293
00:20:40.733 --> 00:20:43.777
Good afternoon.
Uh, my name is Winton.

294
00:20:43.777 --> 00:20:45.946
Nicholas Winton.

295
00:20:45.946 --> 00:20:48.282
Yes, I'm ringing from
the British Committee

296
00:20:48.282 --> 00:20:50.284
for Refugees
from Czechoslovakia.

297
00:20:50.284 --> 00:20:53.245
Well, I'm looking to obtain
a list of vulnerable children.

298
00:20:55.581 --> 00:20:58.417
No, I understand, but we will
have everything in place.

299
00:20:58.417 --> 00:21:00.044
- Hello? Hello?

300
00:21:07.426 --> 00:21:10.387
Yes.
May I at least come and meet?

301
00:21:12.264 --> 00:21:14.058
Thank you for seeing me.

302
00:21:14.058 --> 00:21:15.559
How could I resist?

303
00:21:15.559 --> 00:21:17.603
You're offering to get
children out of Prague.

304
00:21:17.603 --> 00:21:18.687
A lot of them.

305
00:21:18.687 --> 00:21:20.356
That is correct.

306
00:21:20.356 --> 00:21:22.650
Hitler will be thrilled
to know you're helping him

307
00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:24.109
eradicate Jews
from the region.

308
00:21:27.571 --> 00:21:31.492
With... With respect, uh,
I'm moving children

309
00:21:31.492 --> 00:21:34.245
of all faiths and none.

310
00:21:34.245 --> 00:21:35.788
Separating them
from their families,

311
00:21:35.788 --> 00:21:38.499
perhaps from their religion?

312
00:21:38.499 --> 00:21:41.252
Accommodating them
in safe homes,

313
00:21:41.252 --> 00:21:43.879
with families in foster homes.

314
00:21:43.879 --> 00:21:45.089
Jewish foster homes?

315
00:21:48.342 --> 00:21:50.594
I don't know.

316
00:21:50.594 --> 00:21:52.680
I don't think
that's a question for now.

317
00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:55.391
But it's a question
I'm asking.

318
00:21:55.391 --> 00:21:58.060
You are not the only person
at this table

319
00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:59.812
concerned about the well-being
of Jewish children.

320
00:21:59.812 --> 00:22:02.481
Parents in London
are preparing

321
00:22:02.481 --> 00:22:04.441
to send their children
out of the city

322
00:22:04.441 --> 00:22:06.318
to safety in the event
of a war.

323
00:22:06.318 --> 00:22:09.780
What I'm proposing
is no different.

324
00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.449
Your children would
be protected

325
00:22:12.449 --> 00:22:15.244
and returned to their families
as soon as it's safe.

326
00:22:18.038 --> 00:22:20.457
Are you Jewish, Mr Winton?

327
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:25.879
Why would you ask that?

328
00:22:25.879 --> 00:22:28.674
Because I wonder why a person
would undertake

329
00:22:28.674 --> 00:22:31.468
this daunting task for people

330
00:22:31.468 --> 00:22:33.887
to whom he has
no real allegiance,

331
00:22:33.887 --> 00:22:36.515
in a place where
he does not belong.

332
00:22:39.768 --> 00:22:41.437
You're a stockbroker
from London

333
00:22:42.771 --> 00:22:44.732
with a comfortable life,
I presume.

334
00:22:45.858 --> 00:22:47.985
You've done some research.

335
00:22:47.985 --> 00:22:52.114
It is a serious matter.
So, why are you doing this?

336
00:22:52.114 --> 00:22:54.992
What I mean is,
who are you, Mr Winton?

337
00:22:56.118 --> 00:22:57.244
Well...

338
00:22:57.244 --> 00:22:59.580
My father's family

339
00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:03.834
came from Germany
to London in the 1870s.

340
00:23:03.834 --> 00:23:06.128
Till just a few months ago,
we were Wertheims.

341
00:23:07.546 --> 00:23:08.922
We went through the last war

342
00:23:08.922 --> 00:23:11.925
with a German surname
and my mother...

343
00:23:11.925 --> 00:23:15.637
my mother couldn't stand
doing it again, so...

344
00:23:15.637 --> 00:23:19.058
And my grandparents
on both sides were Jewish.

345
00:23:21.352 --> 00:23:24.271
But I was baptised
in the Church of England.

346
00:23:24.271 --> 00:23:25.647
So,

347
00:23:27.316 --> 00:23:28.817
I don't know
what you'd call me.

348
00:23:28.817 --> 00:23:30.152
I would call you a Jew.

349
00:23:33.447 --> 00:23:35.866
I consider myself a European,

350
00:23:37.159 --> 00:23:38.285
an agnostic,

351
00:23:39.661 --> 00:23:40.662
and a Socialist.

352
00:23:42.498 --> 00:23:44.750
There are children here,

353
00:23:46.627 --> 00:23:50.798
living in fields, in the open,
in... in... in mud...

354
00:23:52.883 --> 00:23:54.593
The worst of winter's
still to come

355
00:23:54.593 --> 00:23:57.262
and under the threat
of Nazi invasion.

356
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:59.765
I have seen this

357
00:24:00.891 --> 00:24:02.226
and I cannot unsee it.

358
00:24:04.269 --> 00:24:08.649
And because I may be able
to do something about it,

359
00:24:10.818 --> 00:24:11.819
I must.

360
00:24:13.278 --> 00:24:14.655
At least try.

361
00:24:19.535 --> 00:24:21.495
The task you propose

362
00:24:22.579 --> 00:24:24.873
requires money and visas.

363
00:24:24.873 --> 00:24:26.875
I don't have them. Yet.

364
00:24:31.797 --> 00:24:33.215
But I'll get them.

365
00:24:44.768 --> 00:24:47.521
If I send these children
to you,

366
00:24:47.521 --> 00:24:50.858
I'm placing their lives
in your hands.

367
00:24:50.858 --> 00:24:53.026
A very great responsibility.

368
00:24:53.026 --> 00:24:56.113
So, in the end, Mr Winton,

369
00:24:57.906 --> 00:24:59.992
it is a question of trust.

370
00:25:04.329 --> 00:25:06.248
In Hebrew, there is a saying.

371
00:25:15.757 --> 00:25:17.634
Don't start
what you can't finish.

372
00:25:31.148 --> 00:25:33.525
Hampstead, 7946.

373
00:25:33.525 --> 00:25:34.443
Mother?

374
00:25:34.443 --> 00:25:36.695
Nicky! So good to hear you.

375
00:25:36.695 --> 00:25:37.821
Now, listen, I can't be long.

376
00:25:37.821 --> 00:25:39.948
<i>No, of course not. No, uh...</i>

377
00:25:39.948 --> 00:25:41.158
But are you all right?

378
00:25:41.158 --> 00:25:42.534
<i>Are you safe?</i>

379
00:25:42.534 --> 00:25:43.952
I'm perfectly fine.

380
00:25:43.952 --> 00:25:46.079
<i>You don't sound
very convincing.</i>

381
00:25:46.079 --> 00:25:47.623
Just tell me
you're coming home, yes?

382
00:25:47.623 --> 00:25:49.458
Yes, yes, now, listen.

383
00:25:49.458 --> 00:25:51.001
<i>I need you
to do something for me.</i>

384
00:25:51.543 --> 00:25:53.045
Tell me.

385
00:25:53.045 --> 00:25:54.588
<i>And I'm afraid it's not
going to be easy.</i>

386
00:25:56.965 --> 00:25:58.967
Hello, Rudi, I'd like
to send a telegram.

387
00:25:58.967 --> 00:26:00.594
Yes, certainly, sir,
just a moment.

388
00:26:03.931 --> 00:26:06.141
To, Mr Hart, H-A-R-T...

389
00:26:07.434 --> 00:26:10.270
At Crews Brothers, stockbrokers.

390
00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:11.313
Slight change of plan.

391
00:26:11.313 --> 00:26:14.650
"Slight change."
- Stop.

392
00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:17.611
Working Prague with Refugees.

393
00:26:18.946 --> 00:26:20.280
<i>Return to office delayed.</i>

394
00:26:31.708 --> 00:26:34.253
He thought
you were official. German.

395
00:26:34.253 --> 00:26:36.713
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm sorry. Um...

396
00:26:36.713 --> 00:26:39.550
No, I'm... I'm... I'm trying
to help the families.

397
00:26:48.725 --> 00:26:51.520
- Madam.
- Oh.

398
00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.523
Good morning. My name
is Babette Winton.

399
00:26:54.523 --> 00:26:57.943
I'd like to speak
to someone in immigration.

400
00:26:57.943 --> 00:26:59.403
And where have
you arrived from?

401
00:26:59.403 --> 00:27:02.239
From Hampstead, on the 24 bus.

402
00:27:02.239 --> 00:27:05.033
I'm a British citizen
seeking your advice.

403
00:27:05.033 --> 00:27:07.327
- Do you have an appoint...
- An appointment? No.

404
00:27:07.327 --> 00:27:08.912
But I'm happy to wait.

405
00:27:24.219 --> 00:27:25.429
Mr Jovak?

406
00:27:25.971 --> 00:27:27.055
Here.

407
00:27:27.055 --> 00:27:28.265
Come this way, please.

408
00:27:33.979 --> 00:27:35.147
<i>Anyone else?</i>

409
00:27:35.147 --> 00:27:38.442
Yes, actually, um,
there was a young girl

410
00:27:38.442 --> 00:27:41.069
that I first saw when Doreen
brought me here, um...

411
00:27:41.069 --> 00:27:42.529
She was about 11 or 12.

412
00:27:42.529 --> 00:27:44.615
She had a very young
baby sister.

413
00:27:44.615 --> 00:27:46.450
Applications are considered
according to protocol...

414
00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:48.952
Oh, protocol. That is
a meaningless phrase.

415
00:27:48.952 --> 00:27:51.955
You repeating it ad infinitum
really doesn't help.

416
00:27:51.955 --> 00:27:55.626
These are
unaccompanied children.

417
00:27:55.626 --> 00:27:57.085
They're children,
they are desperate,

418
00:27:57.085 --> 00:27:58.337
and they are starving.

419
00:27:58.337 --> 00:27:59.963
Like many poorer
British children.

420
00:27:59.963 --> 00:28:02.591
British children are not
facing the threat

421
00:28:02.591 --> 00:28:04.301
of imminent Nazi invasion.

422
00:28:04.301 --> 00:28:07.262
Mrs Winton, there are
other people waiting.

423
00:28:11.308 --> 00:28:12.851
If you don't mind...

424
00:28:12.851 --> 00:28:15.979
Young man, I have something
to tell you. Sit down.

425
00:28:23.779 --> 00:28:28.784
I came here 30 years ago,
from Germany, to marry.

426
00:28:28.784 --> 00:28:30.994
I raised my family here.

427
00:28:30.994 --> 00:28:33.622
My husband is buried here.

428
00:28:33.622 --> 00:28:38.335
And what I have most admired
about this country

429
00:28:38.335 --> 00:28:42.381
is its commitment
to decency, kindness,

430
00:28:42.381 --> 00:28:44.883
and respect for others.

431
00:28:44.883 --> 00:28:48.136
I raised my son in accordance
with these values

432
00:28:48.136 --> 00:28:52.391
and he is in Prague, now,
as we speak,

433
00:28:52.391 --> 00:28:56.228
putting these values
into practice.

434
00:28:56.228 --> 00:28:59.648
I am merely asking you
to do the same.

435
00:28:59.648 --> 00:29:01.274
Is that too much to ask?

436
00:29:09.157 --> 00:29:12.035
Ask your questions,
Mrs Winton.

437
00:29:12.035 --> 00:29:15.330
Thank you. Now, I need you
to concentrate

438
00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:17.082
and I need you
to be very clear.

439
00:29:21.795 --> 00:29:22.921
She's 12.

440
00:29:41.982 --> 00:29:45.444
They don't know
whose baby it is. No one does.

441
00:29:45.444 --> 00:29:47.154
She is helping care for her.

442
00:29:50.157 --> 00:29:52.367
But what about the parents?

443
00:29:53.952 --> 00:29:56.997
Hm, taken or dead.

444
00:30:08.925 --> 00:30:10.886
Right.

445
00:30:11.887 --> 00:30:12.888
Let's get on.

446
00:30:35.035 --> 00:30:36.787
<i>This is Maidenhead, 3310.</i>

447
00:30:36.787 --> 00:30:39.498
<i>Nicholas and Grete Winton.
Please leave a message.</i>

448
00:30:41.583 --> 00:30:43.293
<i>Hi, Dad.</i>

449
00:30:43.293 --> 00:30:46.338
<i>It's just me checking in
to see you're okay.</i>

450
00:30:46.338 --> 00:30:48.256
<i>We're all right. Had just been
to the clinic,</i>

451
00:30:48.256 --> 00:30:50.425
<i>everything's fine
with the baby.</i>

452
00:30:50.425 --> 00:30:51.968
<i>Mum says that you're thinking</i>

453
00:30:51.968 --> 00:30:54.095
<i>about what to do
with the briefcase.</i>

454
00:30:54.095 --> 00:30:55.597
<i>Um...</i>

455
00:30:55.597 --> 00:30:57.933
<i>I know that won't
be easy for you.</i>

456
00:30:57.933 --> 00:31:01.061
<i>I'm here if you wanna
talk about it.</i>

457
00:31:01.061 --> 00:31:02.854
<i>Hope you're swimming lots.</i>

458
00:32:50.837 --> 00:32:54.549
In Munich,
Nazis took my brothers.

459
00:32:54.549 --> 00:32:57.719
My nephews tried to stop them,

460
00:32:57.719 --> 00:33:01.890
12, 10 years old, just boys.

461
00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:05.560
They were beaten and thrown
down the stairs

462
00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.854
and taken to the camps.

463
00:33:15.195 --> 00:33:17.906
Eva and Vera.

464
00:33:17.906 --> 00:33:20.283
These are my sister's boys,

465
00:33:20.283 --> 00:33:23.370
Honza and Tommy.

466
00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:26.498
Our family name is Diamantova.

467
00:33:30.377 --> 00:33:31.670
Oh, thank you.

468
00:33:33.588 --> 00:33:34.589
That's Vera.

469
00:33:35.465 --> 00:33:37.342
Eva.

470
00:33:37.342 --> 00:33:38.426
Honza, Tommy.

471
00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:43.390
Oh, what happened here?

472
00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:47.143
She fell. Skiing.
She loves the mountains.

473
00:33:47.143 --> 00:33:49.437
Oh. You like...
You like skiing?

474
00:33:49.437 --> 00:33:50.939
I love skiing.

475
00:33:57.028 --> 00:33:59.406
Skiing
and swimming.

476
00:33:59.406 --> 00:34:02.158
And swimming? Me too.

477
00:34:04.327 --> 00:34:06.121
- Morning, Rudi.
- Morning.

478
00:34:06.121 --> 00:34:07.622
Would you mind putting a call
through to this number for me?

479
00:34:07.622 --> 00:34:09.624
- Of course. Give me a moment.
- Thank you.

480
00:34:09.624 --> 00:34:12.335
And Mr Winton,
you have a telegram.

481
00:34:12.335 --> 00:34:13.837
Oh. Thank you.

482
00:34:28.393 --> 00:34:30.186
Mr Winton, your call.

483
00:34:30.186 --> 00:34:32.814
Cabin number two.

484
00:34:32.814 --> 00:34:34.774
<i>Nicky,
you will not believe</i>

485
00:34:34.774 --> 00:34:37.402
<i>- what they are asking for.</i>
- All right, I'm ready.

486
00:34:37.402 --> 00:34:40.655
<i>A separate visa application
for each child.</i>

487
00:34:40.655 --> 00:34:43.616
An individual sponsor
who must promise to pay

488
00:34:43.616 --> 00:34:46.327
<i>for all the child's needs.</i>

489
00:34:46.327 --> 00:34:51.416
And a fee of 50 pounds to pay
for their eventual return.

490
00:34:51.416 --> 00:34:53.043
- Fifty pounds?
<i>- Yes, I know.</i>

491
00:34:53.043 --> 00:34:54.127
Wait, there's more.

492
00:34:55.378 --> 00:34:57.172
A medical certificate,

493
00:34:57.172 --> 00:35:00.383
uh, and a foster parent
to care for the child

494
00:35:00.383 --> 00:35:02.010
till the age of 17

495
00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:04.721
or until they are able
to return home.

496
00:35:04.721 --> 00:35:06.097
Christ, Nicky!

497
00:35:06.097 --> 00:35:07.182
Yeah.

498
00:35:08.683 --> 00:35:10.185
Nicky?

499
00:35:11.269 --> 00:35:13.146
Mr Slonek. Hello.

500
00:35:13.146 --> 00:35:15.732
Hello, hello. Uh...

501
00:35:15.732 --> 00:35:17.567
I have changed my mind.

502
00:35:17.567 --> 00:35:19.611
Here are, uh, photos,

503
00:35:19.611 --> 00:35:23.114
I believe now
you will help them?

504
00:35:27.202 --> 00:35:29.370
Jan. Petr.

505
00:35:30.789 --> 00:35:33.124
- And... Karel. Karel.
Karel.

506
00:35:34.084 --> 00:35:37.170
When will they go... please?

507
00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:40.673
What did I miss?

508
00:35:40.673 --> 00:35:42.383
Nicky was just saying
we have to assume

509
00:35:42.383 --> 00:35:44.135
that this is happening.

510
00:35:44.135 --> 00:35:45.428
Yeah.

511
00:35:45.428 --> 00:35:47.305
We are moving the children.

512
00:35:47.305 --> 00:35:49.099
In big groups. By train.

513
00:35:49.099 --> 00:35:50.266
That's a two-day trip,

514
00:35:50.266 --> 00:35:51.684
which would mean
crossing Holland

515
00:35:51.684 --> 00:35:53.228
and the Dutch have shut
their borders

516
00:35:53.228 --> 00:35:54.354
to Jewish refugees.

517
00:35:54.354 --> 00:35:56.648
And they'd have
to cross Germany.

518
00:35:56.648 --> 00:35:58.274
Yes, but they'd only
be passing through

519
00:35:58.274 --> 00:35:59.651
and on British visas.

520
00:35:59.651 --> 00:36:01.611
With British
foster parents waiting.

521
00:36:01.611 --> 00:36:03.113
Well, that is, if you can find
British foster parents.

522
00:36:03.113 --> 00:36:06.825
There are a thousand children
on that list.

523
00:36:06.825 --> 00:36:09.828
The welcome may not be as warm
as you're all imagining.

524
00:36:09.828 --> 00:36:12.497
Then we have
to heat things up.

525
00:36:12.497 --> 00:36:14.582
We have to get
the press working.

526
00:36:14.582 --> 00:36:17.502
Get them moving
and on our side.

527
00:36:17.502 --> 00:36:19.879
Ordinary people
wouldn't stand for this

528
00:36:19.879 --> 00:36:23.508
if they knew what
was actually happening.

529
00:36:23.508 --> 00:36:25.969
You've a lot of faith
in ordinary people.

530
00:36:27.637 --> 00:36:31.558
I do because
I'm an ordinary person.

531
00:36:31.558 --> 00:36:32.642
So am I.

532
00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:35.687
And me.

533
00:36:35.687 --> 00:36:37.730
Well, there you go.

534
00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:39.399
That's just what we need,
isn't it?

535
00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.861
An army of the ordinary.

536
00:36:42.861 --> 00:36:46.990
Nicky, you should go back
to London, raise funds.

537
00:36:47.615 --> 00:36:48.783
Raise a stink.

538
00:36:48.783 --> 00:36:50.910
I can do that. No problem.

539
00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:52.370
What about your job
in the bank?

540
00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:54.497
Well, stock market closes
at half past three.

541
00:36:54.497 --> 00:36:56.916
And I'll take care
of this end.

542
00:36:56.916 --> 00:36:58.751
- With Hana's help?
- Of course.

543
00:36:58.751 --> 00:37:00.503
Oh, God.

544
00:37:00.503 --> 00:37:02.463
We're actually doing this,
aren't we?

545
00:37:04.549 --> 00:37:06.968
Here's to the children's
section of the BCRC.

546
00:37:06.968 --> 00:37:08.970
There isn't one.
- There is now.

547
00:37:10.138 --> 00:37:11.389
All those in favour.

548
00:37:17.562 --> 00:37:19.981
Nicky, if I may.

549
00:37:19.981 --> 00:37:22.233
What are you doing?
Excuse me.

550
00:37:22.233 --> 00:37:24.277
My God.

551
00:37:24.277 --> 00:37:26.446
- Those your socks?

552
00:37:26.446 --> 00:37:27.530
Look,
you'll need something

553
00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:28.740
for all that paperwork.

554
00:37:30.241 --> 00:37:31.492
Thank you.

555
00:37:48.968 --> 00:37:51.346
<i>To</i> The Times'
<i>letter section.</i>

556
00:37:51.346 --> 00:37:54.766
<i>Dear sir, I have just returned
from Prague,</i>

557
00:37:54.766 --> 00:37:56.893
where I was assessing the fate

558
00:37:56.893 --> 00:37:59.520
of refugees in the city.

559
00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:02.607
<i>Among the many
unfortunate souls,</i>

560
00:38:02.607 --> 00:38:05.193
<i>I found about 2,000 children</i>

561
00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:07.862
living in damp,

562
00:38:09.364 --> 00:38:10.907
overcrowded camps.

563
00:38:10.907 --> 00:38:13.826
Overcrowded, insanitary camps.

564
00:38:13.826 --> 00:38:15.745
- Yes, true.

565
00:38:15.745 --> 00:38:17.455
In one of the camps,

566
00:38:17.455 --> 00:38:19.916
several have already
succumbed to disease.

567
00:38:21.334 --> 00:38:25.129
<i>I saw a mother cradling
her dead child.</i>

568
00:38:25.129 --> 00:38:27.548
<i>The thousands struggling
to survive</i>

569
00:38:27.548 --> 00:38:30.468
<i>find themselves facing
the threat of Nazi invasion</i>

570
00:38:30.468 --> 00:38:33.221
<i>and the horrors
that will bring.</i>

571
00:38:33.221 --> 00:38:36.307
<i>We are working to evacuate
these children by train</i>

572
00:38:36.307 --> 00:38:40.520
<i>to safety in Britain
as a matter of urgency.</i>

573
00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:45.650
<i>Will people please help with
donations or foster homes?</i>

574
00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:49.028

The wanderer returns!

579
00:39:00.206 --> 00:39:02.417
Crikey, Nicky,
Hart's been apoplectic.

580
00:39:02.417 --> 00:39:03.793
Oh, well.

581
00:39:03.793 --> 00:39:05.128
There goes your bonus.

582
00:39:19.559 --> 00:39:20.560
Mother.

583
00:39:21.436 --> 00:39:23.271
Sorry. Thank you.

584
00:39:29.277 --> 00:39:30.987
I've seen your letter
in the press.

585
00:39:30.987 --> 00:39:33.197
Well, then you understand
the urgency.

586
00:39:34.615 --> 00:39:35.867
The process...

587
00:39:35.867 --> 00:39:38.161
Our first group
consists of 20 children

588
00:39:38.161 --> 00:39:39.871
who are in the most dire need.

589
00:39:39.871 --> 00:39:42.540
They will arrive by train
into Liverpool Street Station

590
00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.375
in two weeks' time.

591
00:39:46.878 --> 00:39:50.840
Yes, two weeks, a fortnight.

592
00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.843
Which is why we're
asking for your help to...

593
00:39:53.843 --> 00:39:55.219
to accelerate the process.

594
00:39:55.219 --> 00:39:57.430
Applications are dealt
with in turn.

595
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:58.765
The process takes time.

596
00:39:58.765 --> 00:40:00.350
We don't have time.

597
00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:02.852
The German army could
cross the border any day.

598
00:40:06.147 --> 00:40:08.441
Mr Leadbetter...

599
00:40:08.441 --> 00:40:11.861
these are your children, yes?

600
00:40:11.861 --> 00:40:13.237
- They are.
- There are families

601
00:40:13.237 --> 00:40:16.908
just like this,
just like yours,

602
00:40:16.908 --> 00:40:20.078
living in conditions
you cannot imagine.

603
00:40:20.078 --> 00:40:22.080
The threat of war
hangs over them.

604
00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.499
What they have done for you

605
00:40:24.499 --> 00:40:27.960
is to stand
against Nazi expansionism.

606
00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.171
All they ask, in return,

607
00:40:30.171 --> 00:40:33.257
is a temporary refuge
for their children.

608
00:40:33.257 --> 00:40:37.053
From whatever horror
is yet to come.

609
00:40:37.053 --> 00:40:39.889
Isn't that the least
this country should offer?

610
00:40:44.227 --> 00:40:45.895
Provided your paperwork
is in order.

611
00:40:45.895 --> 00:40:47.230
It is in perfect order.

612
00:40:48.815 --> 00:40:50.400
Then I'll do my best.

613
00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:54.237
Two weeks, where are we going
to find the money?

614
00:40:55.154 --> 00:40:56.155
We'll find it.

615
00:40:56.155 --> 00:40:58.741
In two weeks?

616
00:40:58.741 --> 00:41:02.036
- And the foster families?
- I know. We'll do it.

617
00:41:02.036 --> 00:41:04.497
Olga Santer...
Santer, yes.

618
00:41:04.497 --> 00:41:07.959
... and Petr Slonek.
Slonek, Petr, yes.

619
00:41:12.797 --> 00:41:14.966
Right. It's a start.

620
00:41:27.228 --> 00:41:29.897
<i>Jan Slonek, number 174.</i>

621
00:41:30.898 --> 00:41:33.401
Petr Slonek, 144.

622
00:41:36.612 --> 00:41:37.822
<i>Rosa Lenart,</i>

623
00:41:38.614 --> 00:41:41.659
number 529.

624
00:41:41.659 --> 00:41:43.911
Good.
Tommy Katschinsky,

625
00:41:43.911 --> 00:41:46.914
number nine.
Michael Lappert, 46.

626
00:41:46.914 --> 00:41:49.542
- Landesmann, 19.
Next.

627
00:41:49.542 --> 00:41:51.210
<i>Jacob...</i>

628
00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:54.130
<i>...number twenty-four.</i>

629
00:41:57.049 --> 00:41:59.385
<i>I have a family
from Shropshire</i>

630
00:41:59.385 --> 00:42:02.930
<i>that will take a girl,
8 to 11 years,</i>

631
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:05.099
<i>and Mr and Mrs Horrell</i>

632
00:42:05.099 --> 00:42:07.810
that will take a boy,
just one,

633
00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:11.230
but ideally under eight
and brown haired.

634
00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:13.065
There you go.

635
00:42:16.819 --> 00:42:18.613
Martin.

636
00:42:18.613 --> 00:42:20.406
So sorry I wasn't
with you in Prague.

637
00:42:20.406 --> 00:42:21.782
Not at all.

638
00:42:21.782 --> 00:42:24.702
Anyway, I'm here now.
What can I do?

639
00:42:24.702 --> 00:42:27.538
Well, we've got, uh,
20 children ready to travel

640
00:42:27.538 --> 00:42:29.123
and only eight foster homes.

641
00:42:29.123 --> 00:42:31.209
There's plenty of people
who'd gladly take a child,

642
00:42:31.209 --> 00:42:32.919
but they can't raise
the 50 pounds guarantee.

643
00:42:32.919 --> 00:42:37.465
So, that's what we need
most right now. It's money.

644
00:42:37.465 --> 00:42:38.716
Let me make some calls.

645
00:42:39.425 --> 00:42:40.426
Phone?

646
00:42:40.426 --> 00:42:42.428
Come with me. Coffee?

647
00:42:42.428 --> 00:42:44.889
Nicky, five pounds!

648
00:42:44.889 --> 00:42:49.143
Five pounds, 20 pounds from
the Girl Guides and then...

649
00:42:49.143 --> 00:42:51.646
That's 100 in one day!

650
00:42:51.646 --> 00:42:55.107
<i>And then</i> Picture Post <i>has
raised 90 pounds.</i>

651
00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.631
Ready?
We've foster families

652
00:43:18.631 --> 00:43:21.968
for, uh, Marlia Keller,

653
00:43:21.968 --> 00:43:25.721
<i>- uh, Kristina Novotka...</i>
Mm-hmm.

654
00:43:25.721 --> 00:43:28.641
- ...the Blaufrank twins.
- <i>Yes.</i>

655
00:43:28.641 --> 00:43:31.227
<i>And Jan
and Petr Slonek.</i>

656
00:43:31.227 --> 00:43:33.354
And their brother?

657
00:43:33.354 --> 00:43:35.189
No. No one would
take all three.

658
00:43:35.856 --> 00:43:36.857
Goodness.

659
00:43:36.857 --> 00:43:39.235
Tell them
it won't be long now.

660
00:43:39.235 --> 00:43:41.654
- We'll be moving them soon.
<i>- Nicky,</i>

661
00:43:41.654 --> 00:43:43.364
it's getting harder here.

662
00:43:43.364 --> 00:43:46.200
Two more people from Doreen's
list have disappeared.

663
00:43:48.286 --> 00:43:49.704
<i>I don't know
how long we've got.</i>

664
00:44:56.103 --> 00:44:58.272
Come on, then.
Good lads.

665
00:44:58.272 --> 00:45:01.067
There you go, good lads.

666
00:45:02.401 --> 00:45:03.402
All right.

667
00:45:44.819 --> 00:45:46.487
Thank God you're here.
I was worried.

668
00:45:46.487 --> 00:45:47.571
I'm so sorry.

669
00:45:49.323 --> 00:45:50.866
All right,
all right, all right.

670
00:45:52.993 --> 00:45:55.830
Petr Slonek.
- Slonek. Petr and Jan.

671
00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:57.289
174.

672
00:45:57.289 --> 00:45:58.874
Thank you.

673
00:45:58.874 --> 00:46:00.334
144.
144.

674
00:46:00.334 --> 00:46:02.336
So, that's only one
we're missing, now.

675
00:46:02.336 --> 00:46:04.422
- Check them all.

676
00:46:04.422 --> 00:46:05.506
This is our train.

677
00:46:11.429 --> 00:46:12.596

680
00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:25.568
Come on, come on, let's go.

681
00:46:25.568 --> 00:46:28.070
Okay. Okay.

682
00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:31.031
Good girl.

683
00:47:10.696 --> 00:47:12.948
<i>The train at platform eight</i>

Yes.

00:49:02.474 --> 00:49:03.559
Frank.
Come on, boys,

709
00:49:03.559 --> 00:49:04.476
- let's get you home.
- Thank you.

710
00:49:04.476 --> 00:49:06.812
Mr and Mrs Harland?

711
00:49:08.606 --> 00:49:10.190
Harland?

712
00:51:11.395 --> 00:51:12.896
Hi, Nicky.

713
00:51:12.896 --> 00:51:14.023
Oh, hello, Geoff.

714
00:51:14.023 --> 00:51:15.357
You wanna come through?

715
00:51:15.357 --> 00:51:16.817
Yes, thank you.

716
00:51:16.817 --> 00:51:18.110
All right?

717
00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:20.529
Yes, of course I am.

718
00:51:20.529 --> 00:51:22.197
You don't have to look
so nervous.

719
00:51:22.948 --> 00:51:24.074
I can't help it.

720
00:51:24.074 --> 00:51:25.367
Whenever I see you comin',

721
00:51:25.367 --> 00:51:26.869
I know it's gonna
cost me a fortune.

722
00:51:26.869 --> 00:51:28.454
Oh, all in a good cause.

723
00:51:32.458 --> 00:51:34.668
So, which is it this time?

724
00:51:34.668 --> 00:51:37.421
Samaritans? MENCAP?
Abbeyfield?

725
00:51:38.922 --> 00:51:42.885
Oh, something new.
Or rather, old.

726
00:51:42.885 --> 00:51:44.136
Take a seat, Nicky.

727
00:51:44.136 --> 00:51:46.430
Yes. Thank you.

728
00:51:53.145 --> 00:51:58.942
It's about, uh, documents
from the Second World War

729
00:51:58.942 --> 00:52:01.820
- rather relevant for today.
- The war?

730
00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:04.531
- Yes.
- Oh, it's exciting.

731
00:52:04.531 --> 00:52:08.869
It's the, uh, 50th anniversary
of the outbreak coming up.

732
00:52:08.869 --> 00:52:10.329
Yes, I suppose it must be.

733
00:52:10.329 --> 00:52:12.581
Yeah, we're planning
a series of special editions.

734
00:52:12.581 --> 00:52:13.874
- Oh.
- Where did you serve?

735
00:52:13.874 --> 00:52:15.501
Army, Navy?

736
00:52:15.501 --> 00:52:17.836
Oh, well, that's neither
here nor there, is it?

737
00:52:17.836 --> 00:52:19.379
Yeah, I bet you got
some stories.

738
00:52:20.589 --> 00:52:22.424
It's really not about me.

739
00:52:22.424 --> 00:52:24.968
It's actually very important.
It's, uh,

740
00:52:26.053 --> 00:52:27.721
about refugees.

741
00:52:29.348 --> 00:52:30.432
Refugees?

742
00:52:31.391 --> 00:52:32.392
Yeah.

743
00:52:33.894 --> 00:52:36.021
I'm not really seeing

744
00:52:36.021 --> 00:52:38.565
the Maidenhead angle
in refugees.

745
00:52:47.032 --> 00:52:49.451
<i>We wanna be famous</i>

746
00:52:49.451 --> 00:52:51.912
<i>We wanna be on TV</i>

747
00:52:51.912 --> 00:52:54.456
<i>Famous, famous
Famous, famous</i>

748
00:53:33.203 --> 00:53:35.455
<i>Hello?</i>
- Hello.

749
00:53:35.455 --> 00:53:36.957
Guess who this is?

750
00:53:36.957 --> 00:53:38.959
- Oh, good afternoon.
Good afternoon.

751
00:53:38.959 --> 00:53:40.586
I'm meeting Mr Martin Blake.

752
00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:42.546
Thank you.

753
00:53:42.546 --> 00:53:44.590
- Oh, certainly.
- Thank you.

754
00:53:44.590 --> 00:53:45.757
If you'd like to follow me?

755
00:53:45.757 --> 00:53:47.009
Yes. Thank you.

756
00:54:02.983 --> 00:54:05.736
Hello, Martin. Thank you.
How are you?

757
00:54:05.736 --> 00:54:07.112
- Nicky.
- Good to see you.

758
00:54:07.112 --> 00:54:09.239
So, you're footloose

759
00:54:09.239 --> 00:54:10.616
for a couple of days?

760
00:54:10.616 --> 00:54:11.992
Yes. Looks like it,
doesn't it?

761
00:54:11.992 --> 00:54:13.493
Time to catch up.
I'm glad.

762
00:54:13.493 --> 00:54:15.204
Yeah, it's not much time,
I'm afraid,

763
00:54:15.204 --> 00:54:18.582
because, um, I've been given
my to-do list, you know?

764
00:54:18.582 --> 00:54:20.459
Grete's reorganising
everything

765
00:54:20.459 --> 00:54:22.377
- before the baby arrives.
- Oh, yes!

766
00:54:22.377 --> 00:54:24.254
A grandfather. You excited?

767
00:54:24.254 --> 00:54:26.590
- No, I'm bloody terrified.
Why?

768
00:54:26.590 --> 00:54:28.550
- I don't know.
- It'll be fun, I'm sure.

769
00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:30.636
Oh, really? If you say so.

770
00:54:30.636 --> 00:54:33.847
Uh, anyway, at the moment,
we're just, um,

771
00:54:33.847 --> 00:54:35.641
throwing out a lot of old
stuff, you know? And, uh...

772
00:54:35.641 --> 00:54:38.143
- Piles up.
- Yes, it does. Yeah.

773
00:54:38.143 --> 00:54:39.311
You have to be ruthless.

774
00:54:39.311 --> 00:54:41.313
- I know.
- Yeah. Box files and,

775
00:54:41.313 --> 00:54:43.106
uh, records of all the old
charity work, you know?

776
00:54:43.106 --> 00:54:44.733
You've always been so busy.

777
00:54:44.733 --> 00:54:46.235
Oh, yeah.

778
00:54:46.235 --> 00:54:48.487
Do you still volunteer
with the Samaritans?

779
00:54:48.487 --> 00:54:49.780
No, no. They kicked me out.

780
00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:51.657
What?
What on earth for?

781
00:54:51.657 --> 00:54:54.952
A woman, uh, phoned
in and told me she was, um...

782
00:54:54.952 --> 00:54:56.620
planning on killing herself.

783
00:54:56.620 --> 00:54:58.205
I said, "Oh, dear me,
there must be something else

784
00:54:58.205 --> 00:54:59.498
-"you'd rather be doing."
You didn't.

785
00:54:59.498 --> 00:55:00.749
Yes, I did.

786
00:55:00.749 --> 00:55:02.793
She told me
that she wanted to visit

787
00:55:02.793 --> 00:55:04.503
her daughter in America.

788
00:55:04.503 --> 00:55:06.380
But her doctor warned her
that the journey

789
00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:08.048
would probably kill her.

790
00:55:08.048 --> 00:55:09.549
I said, "Well, that's exactly
what you want, isn't it?

791
00:55:09.549 --> 00:55:10.676
-"To be killed?"

792
00:55:10.676 --> 00:55:12.761
Yeah, well,
she had a good laugh.

793
00:55:12.761 --> 00:55:14.263
We both had a good laugh.

794
00:55:14.263 --> 00:55:16.098
She went off to America.
She saw her daughter.

795
00:55:16.098 --> 00:55:17.266
Had a wonderful time.
Came back,

796
00:55:17.266 --> 00:55:18.642
- was happy as a lark.
- Oh.

797
00:55:18.642 --> 00:55:21.311
But, uh, ooh, the Samaritans.
Oh, God bless them.

798
00:55:21.311 --> 00:55:22.562
They gave me
a real bollocking,

799
00:55:22.562 --> 00:55:23.897
pardon my French,

800
00:55:23.897 --> 00:55:25.691
and, uh, told me
I'd broken all the rules.

801
00:55:25.691 --> 00:55:27.651
Well, you know, I couldn't
just sit there, could I?

802
00:55:27.651 --> 00:55:30.070
I mean, you're listening
to a bunch of lonely people

803
00:55:30.070 --> 00:55:31.822
when there was something
I could actually say

804
00:55:31.822 --> 00:55:33.031
to help cheer them up.

805
00:55:35.409 --> 00:55:37.077
You might wanna
slow down anyway.

806
00:55:37.077 --> 00:55:39.538
What, with the baby coming.

807
00:55:39.538 --> 00:55:40.956
Why would I want to slow down?

808
00:55:40.956 --> 00:55:42.124
Oh, to enjoy it.

809
00:55:42.124 --> 00:55:43.834
You've done enough.

810
00:55:43.834 --> 00:55:45.377
No. It's never enough, is it?

811
00:55:47.462 --> 00:55:49.256
Did you, uh, need more time
with the wine list?

812
00:55:49.256 --> 00:55:50.507
Oh, yes, um...

813
00:55:52.175 --> 00:55:53.468
They have nice <i>Château Neuf.</i>

814
00:55:57.597 --> 00:55:59.099
We'll have the <i>Chablis.</i>

815
00:55:59.099 --> 00:56:00.517
- Oh, dear.
Thank you.

816
00:56:01.893 --> 00:56:03.603
Where were we, now? Oh, yes.

817
00:56:03.603 --> 00:56:06.523
When I was clearing out
all the papers,

818
00:56:06.523 --> 00:56:09.443
I came across that old, uh,
scrapbook from Prague.

819
00:56:09.443 --> 00:56:10.610
- Do you remember that?
- I do.

820
00:56:10.610 --> 00:56:12.612
Yes, you're not throwing
that out.

821
00:56:12.612 --> 00:56:14.072
No, I think it could be quite

822
00:56:14.072 --> 00:56:15.782
an important little record,
in its way.

823
00:56:15.782 --> 00:56:18.285
You know, full of history
we should learn from.

824
00:56:18.285 --> 00:56:20.203
- It is.
- Yeah.

825
00:56:22.581 --> 00:56:24.333
Look, maybe the, um,

826
00:56:24.333 --> 00:56:27.627
the Wiener archive
might like it. In London.

827
00:56:27.627 --> 00:56:29.254
Yeah?

828
00:56:29.254 --> 00:56:31.840
I know people on the board,
I could mention it.

829
00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:34.926
Yeah, well, it'll probably
just gather dust there.

830
00:56:34.926 --> 00:56:37.095
I mean, I tried showing it
to the Editor

831
00:56:37.095 --> 00:56:39.097
of the Maidenhead newspaper,
what's it called?

832
00:56:39.097 --> 00:56:41.808
<i>The Advertiser</i> or something.

833
00:56:41.808 --> 00:56:44.478
And, um, it's funny because
when I told him

834
00:56:44.478 --> 00:56:46.188
about the refugees, he said,

835
00:56:46.188 --> 00:56:48.023
"I don't quite get
the Maidenhead angle."

836
00:56:49.399 --> 00:56:50.901
So, uh, he's a bit
of a twit, really.

837
00:56:50.901 --> 00:56:53.236
Well, you might like
to donate it to a museum.

838
00:56:53.236 --> 00:56:55.405
In Prague? Or in Israel?

839
00:56:55.405 --> 00:56:56.990
Most of the children
were Jewish, after all.

840
00:56:57.574 --> 00:56:58.658
Prague.

841
00:57:01.328 --> 00:57:03.914
Well... Yeah.

842
00:57:04.956 --> 00:57:05.999
Tell me something...

843
00:57:08.502 --> 00:57:09.920
Do you ever think
about the children

844
00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:11.421
and what happened to them?

845
00:57:11.421 --> 00:57:13.673
Yes, yes, I do.
From time to time.

846
00:57:13.673 --> 00:57:14.841
Do you?

847
00:57:16.593 --> 00:57:18.178
No, not really.

848
00:57:18.178 --> 00:57:20.806
Well, maybe a little, recently.

849
00:57:20.806 --> 00:57:24.393
It is incredible.
What you achieved.

850
00:57:24.393 --> 00:57:25.727
Oh, I don't think
of it that way.

851
00:57:25.727 --> 00:57:27.104
No, no, no, no,
I mean it.

852
00:57:27.938 --> 00:57:29.773
Truly.

853
00:57:29.773 --> 00:57:31.233
I mean, you should be proud.

854
00:57:31.233 --> 00:57:33.276
- Well.
- Save one life,

855
00:57:33.276 --> 00:57:35.987
save the world. You know?

856
00:57:35.987 --> 00:57:38.490
Well, it's nothing
to brag about.

857
00:57:38.490 --> 00:57:40.534
I mean, look at Doreen
and, uh, Trevor.

858
00:57:40.534 --> 00:57:41.910
They did far more than I did

859
00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:43.161
and they took all the risks.

860
00:57:43.161 --> 00:57:45.705
And they actually stayed
in Prague.

861
00:57:45.705 --> 00:57:49.376
You know, Nicky,
telling people isn't bragging.

862
00:57:51.128 --> 00:57:53.004
No.

863
00:58:26.079 --> 00:58:27.956
Hampstead, 7946.

864
00:58:27.956 --> 00:58:30.208
The Germans crossed
the frontier this morning.

865
00:58:30.208 --> 00:58:31.293
<i>They've already taken over</i>

866
00:58:31.293 --> 00:58:32.836
<i>- the ministry.</i>
- Oh, God.

867
00:58:32.836 --> 00:58:35.964
Hitler's motorcade
just went past the hotel.

868
00:58:35.964 --> 00:58:37.299
He was waving.

869
00:58:49.269 --> 00:58:52.772
What does
this mean? For us?

870
00:58:52.772 --> 00:58:56.735
I have to go. We need
to check safe houses.

871
00:58:56.735 --> 00:58:58.737
- Just be careful.

872
00:58:58.737 --> 00:59:01.448
Doreen? Doree...

873
00:59:09.956 --> 00:59:12.209
It's not safe for them here.
Please, get them home.

874
00:59:14.294 --> 00:59:16.213
Just make sure all the lists
are locked up.

875
00:59:44.991 --> 00:59:46.826
<i>Downing Street has advised</i>

876
00:59:46.826 --> 00:59:49.996
<i>that this development does not
mean that Germany is at war.</i>

877
00:59:49.996 --> 00:59:51.706
<i>The Germans are understood
to have taken</i>

878
00:59:51.706 --> 00:59:54.584
<i>an administrative position
in Czechoslovakia,</i>

879
00:59:54.584 --> 00:59:56.962
<i>replacing the government
in Prague.</i>

880
00:59:56.962 --> 00:59:58.088
<i>Flights from Prague...</i>

881
00:59:58.088 --> 00:59:59.798
What happens now?

882
00:59:59.798 --> 01:00:02.300
We work harder.

883
01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:05.845
Instead of standing here
wringing our hands in despair.

884
01:00:05.845 --> 01:00:07.430
We need more trains.

885
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:09.641
We do whatever it takes
to make that happen.

886
01:00:09.641 --> 01:00:11.476
We find more homes.

887
01:00:11.476 --> 01:00:13.937
We place the children faster.

888
01:00:13.937 --> 01:00:15.647
We're doing as much as we can.

889
01:00:15.647 --> 01:00:17.649
It's not enough, though,
is it?

890
01:00:20.902 --> 01:00:22.696
Look, we cannot...

891
01:00:22.696 --> 01:00:25.782
we cannot let
these people down.

892
01:00:25.782 --> 01:00:28.034
<i>Well, they tell us
the borders are still open.</i>

893
01:00:28.034 --> 01:00:30.537
The thing is now every visa
has to be approved

894
01:00:31.788 --> 01:00:33.415
and stamped by the Gestapo.

895
01:00:33.415 --> 01:00:35.625
<i>The bastards are all over
bloody everything now.</i>

896
01:00:40.088 --> 01:00:41.673
Mr Winton?
Oh, yeah. Oh, hello.

897
01:00:41.673 --> 01:00:43.425
<i>The New Statesman.</i>

898
01:00:43.425 --> 01:00:45.010
Oh, hi.

899
01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:46.678
Uh, shall we speak as we go?

900
01:00:46.678 --> 01:00:48.054
Uh, yes, please.

901
01:00:48.054 --> 01:00:49.306
I don't think
I can recall

902
01:00:49.306 --> 01:00:52.517
ever seeing anything
quite so moving.

903
01:00:52.517 --> 01:00:55.145
How many are there? There must
be, uh, nearly a hundred.

904
01:00:55.145 --> 01:00:57.105
Uh, yes, yes.
Well over a hundred.

905
01:00:57.105 --> 01:01:01.735
Hello. Uh, and this is
our largest transport so far.

906
01:01:01.735 --> 01:01:02.819
<i>And this is
your fourth train.</i>

907
01:01:02.819 --> 01:01:04.195
<i>Are there more planned?</i>

908
01:01:04.195 --> 01:01:05.739
<i>Yes, absolutely.</i>

909
01:01:05.739 --> 01:01:08.074
<i>The fifth train's
only a few weeks away</i>

910
01:01:08.074 --> 01:01:09.993
<i>with more trains
already booked.</i>

911
01:01:09.993 --> 01:01:13.413
<i>The eighth is confirmed,
and the ninth's in preparation</i>

912
01:01:13.413 --> 01:01:15.582
<i>and, um, hundreds of children
ready to board,</i>

913
01:01:15.582 --> 01:01:18.043
<i>but there are thousands more
who need our help</i>

914
01:01:18.043 --> 01:01:19.878
<i>all over Czechoslovakia.</i>

915
01:01:19.878 --> 01:01:22.714
<i>And these are children who are
homeless, they're starving.</i>

916
01:01:22.714 --> 01:01:25.425
<i>And we don't know how long
the border will remain open.</i>

917
01:01:25.425 --> 01:01:28.303
<i>So, we do desperately need
donations and foster homes.</i>

918
01:01:35.894 --> 01:01:37.270
- Hello?
<i>Nicky.</i>

919
01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:39.230
Nicky, it's me.

920
01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:41.733
Um, look, we have one or two
missing from the next list.

921
01:01:41.733 --> 01:01:44.110
<i>- </i>  Missing?
<i>Yes, I don't know.</i>

922
01:01:44.110 --> 01:01:48.782
Either they panicked or...
or they were arrested.

923
01:01:48.782 --> 01:01:51.368
Uh, right. Well, um, you'd
better give me their names.

924
01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:55.080
This one, ah.

925
01:01:56.206 --> 01:01:58.958
That's her. Lenka Weiss.

926
01:02:00.794 --> 01:02:02.128
There was a baby, too.

927
01:02:06.132 --> 01:02:07.133
Damn.

928
01:02:10.679 --> 01:02:12.847
Nicky,

929
01:02:12.847 --> 01:02:16.393
you must know we cannot
save them all.

930
01:02:16.393 --> 01:02:18.561
You have to forgive
yourself that.

931
01:02:46.297 --> 01:02:48.633
If you want Leadbetter,
he's on his hols.

932
01:02:48.633 --> 01:02:50.927
Week in Eastbourne,
shame about the rain.

933
01:02:50.927 --> 01:02:52.929
Look, I urgently
need three visas

934
01:02:52.929 --> 01:02:54.889
for a transport
leaving Prague next week.

935
01:02:54.889 --> 01:02:57.600
Sorry. Can't help you there.

936
01:03:02.772 --> 01:03:04.149
- Trevor.
- Is everything all right?

937
01:03:04.149 --> 01:03:07.318
Listen,
we're three visas short,

938
01:03:07.318 --> 01:03:12.073
Isabel Keller and Eva
and Vera Diamantova.

939
01:03:12.073 --> 01:03:14.492
<i>Is there anything you can do?</i>

940
01:03:27.297 --> 01:03:30.008
I don't know
what you're doing.

941
01:03:30.008 --> 01:03:32.177
But if you're doing
what I think you're doing,

942
01:03:33.094 --> 01:03:34.721
I don't want to know.

943
01:03:38.308 --> 01:03:39.976
Train leaves at eight.

944
01:04:16.137 --> 01:04:17.514
Where is he?
- I don't know.

945
01:04:17.514 --> 01:04:18.723
He should have
been here an hour ago.

946
01:04:29.818 --> 01:04:31.653
- Do you have them?
- Yes.

947
01:04:31.653 --> 01:04:33.988
We have them.

948
01:05:53.359 --> 01:05:54.819
- They've left Prague.

949
01:06:39.614 --> 01:06:41.366
Yes.

950
01:07:02.762 --> 01:07:04.889
Why does England
want all these Jews?

951
01:07:23.616 --> 01:07:26.744
Miss Howson
from Putney, please.

952
01:07:27.662 --> 01:07:31.040
Diamantova, Eva.

953
01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:33.918
Um, along here, please.
Uh, yes, sir.

954
01:07:33.918 --> 01:07:36.254
Thank you, Mrs MacFarlane.

955
01:07:36.254 --> 01:07:37.630
Mrs MacFarlane?

956
01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:38.715
Hello.

957
01:07:40.216 --> 01:07:42.969
Thank you.
There they are.

958
01:07:42.969 --> 01:07:45.555
Thank you.
Uh, Diamantova, Vera.

959
01:07:45.555 --> 01:07:47.724
Lovely to meet you.

960
01:07:47.724 --> 01:07:49.809
Mrs Rainford.

961
01:07:49.809 --> 01:07:52.395
Yes.
Sorry, excuse me.

962
01:07:53.521 --> 01:07:54.522
Hello, dear.

963
01:07:55.857 --> 01:07:56.858
- Hello.
Thank you.

964
01:07:59.777 --> 01:08:00.778
Come along.

965
01:08:04.073 --> 01:08:05.324
Are you hungry?

966
01:08:05.324 --> 01:08:06.868
Someone needs
to tell these people

967
01:08:06.868 --> 01:08:08.244
that they've only got
the children temporarily.

968
01:08:08.244 --> 01:08:12.373
They've all got families
to return to.

969
01:08:12.373 --> 01:08:14.125
Our most urgent cases yet.

970
01:08:14.125 --> 01:08:16.252
They're booked on a train,
the ninth train,

971
01:08:16.252 --> 01:08:17.628
in three days' time.

972
01:08:17.628 --> 01:08:19.130
Please, Leadbetter.

973
01:08:27.555 --> 01:08:29.640
We'll do it. Of course.

974
01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:31.601
Thank you.

975
01:08:56.959 --> 01:08:58.002
Hello?

976
01:09:08.846 --> 01:09:10.640
<i>Today's main event.</i>

977
01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:15.686
<i>Germany has invaded Poland
and has bombed many towns.</i>

978
01:09:15.686 --> 01:09:20.066
<i>General mobilisation has been
ordered in Britain and France.</i>

979
01:09:20.066 --> 01:09:23.694
<i>Parliament was summoned
for six o'clock this evening.</i>

980
01:09:23.694 --> 01:09:26.656
<i>The mobilisation of the navy,
army and the air force...</i>

981
01:09:26.656 --> 01:09:29.992
Winton,
where're you going? Winton?

982
01:09:29.992 --> 01:09:31.577
There's nothing you can do
for them now.

983
01:09:31.577 --> 01:09:32.829
Winton!

984
01:09:44.048 --> 01:09:45.424
Excuse me. Excuse me.

985
01:09:45.424 --> 01:09:47.260
- Excuse me.
Stop pushing.

986
01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:48.594
Look, listen, what's happening
to the international trains?

987
01:09:48.594 --> 01:09:50.096
I don't know
any more than you do.

988
01:09:50.096 --> 01:09:51.889
There's a train due
to leave from Prague.

989
01:09:51.889 --> 01:09:54.183
You need to go
to the station now.

990
01:09:54.183 --> 01:09:55.351
I am staying to help.

991
01:09:55.351 --> 01:09:56.978
No, no.

992
01:09:56.978 --> 01:10:00.231
If they catch you,
I can't protect you. Go, now!

993
01:10:45.735 --> 01:10:46.736
Trevor.

994
01:10:46.736 --> 01:10:47.820
Are you all right?

995
01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:49.155
Yes, I am.

996
01:10:49.155 --> 01:10:50.364
I'm... I'm going
to go back to Doreen.

997
01:10:50.364 --> 01:10:52.491
- Should I...
- You should leave now.

998
01:10:52.491 --> 01:10:55.828
You have your papers.
Go with the children.

999
01:10:55.828 --> 01:10:56.913
See you in London.

1000
01:10:56.913 --> 01:10:57.997
Be careful.

1001
01:11:00.082 --> 01:11:01.918
You too. Bye.

1002
01:11:44.710 --> 01:11:46.587
Hello.
Hello, darling.

1003
01:11:46.587 --> 01:11:49.215
Welcome back.

1004
01:11:49.215 --> 01:11:50.716
Ah. Mm.

1005
01:11:51.926 --> 01:11:53.219
Here you go.

1006
01:11:59.976 --> 01:12:01.894
Goodness.

1007
01:12:01.894 --> 01:12:03.062
Come and see this.

1008
01:12:04.355 --> 01:12:05.356
Big surprise.

1009
01:12:17.201 --> 01:12:18.703
Well...

1010
01:12:18.703 --> 01:12:21.789
You have got
a lot done.

1011
01:12:21.789 --> 01:12:24.458
Yeah. Do you want
a cup of tea?

1012
01:12:35.136 --> 01:12:36.721
<i>Hello, Mr Winton.</i>

1013
01:12:36.721 --> 01:12:38.556
<i>This is Karl Caplan
at the Weiner Library.</i>

1014
01:12:38.556 --> 01:12:39.890
<i>Uh, Martin Blake</i>

1015
01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:41.517
<i>- gave us your details.</i>
Oh.

1016
01:12:41.517 --> 01:12:43.185
<i>We have a researcher
who we think</i>

1017
01:12:43.185 --> 01:12:45.438
<i>might find your archives
very interesting.</i>

1018
01:12:45.438 --> 01:12:51.819
<i>So, if you can, please call us
back on 01-636-7247.</i>

1019
01:12:51.819 --> 01:12:54.155
<i>We look forward to hearing
from you. Many thanks.</i>

1020
01:12:57.074 --> 01:13:00.119
Um, I just mentioned it
in passing.

1021
01:13:00.119 --> 01:13:02.496
Hmm.
- But, uh,

1022
01:13:02.496 --> 01:13:05.458
Martin, uh,
he got straight onto them.

1023
01:13:06.542 --> 01:13:09.920
And, uh... You know...

1024
01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:12.840
But I don't want it
to go into a library.

1025
01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:14.300
Why not?

1026
01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:16.552
Oh, well, it won't
teach anyone anything

1027
01:13:16.552 --> 01:13:17.845
stuck on the shelf.

1028
01:13:22.683 --> 01:13:23.934
Then call them.

1029
01:13:25.436 --> 01:13:26.437
Talk to them.

1030
01:13:32.234 --> 01:13:34.487
Yes. Well, I'm very grateful.

1031
01:13:34.487 --> 01:13:36.113
<i>Well,
we look forward to seeing you.</i>

1032
01:13:36.113 --> 01:13:37.198
Thank you.

1033
01:13:42.411 --> 01:13:44.789
- Tell me.

1034
01:13:44.789 --> 01:13:48.250
Well, there's this woman who
wants to see the scrapbook.

1035
01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:49.710
She's a historian,

1036
01:13:49.710 --> 01:13:52.254
married to some... a man
from Czechoslovakia.

1037
01:13:52.254 --> 01:13:54.048
His name is Robert Maxwell.

1038
01:13:54.048 --> 01:13:55.424
The newspaper man?

1039
01:13:55.424 --> 01:13:58.094
Yes, that's right and, uh,

1040
01:13:58.094 --> 01:14:00.596
she's running some
kind of a conference

1041
01:14:00.596 --> 01:14:02.348
and she wants to meet me.

1042
01:14:02.348 --> 01:14:04.600
Elizabeth Maxwell,
she calls herself Betty.

1043
01:14:05.851 --> 01:14:07.812
She's French, apparently.

1044
01:14:37.216 --> 01:14:38.551
I'm Nicholas Winton.

1045
01:14:38.551 --> 01:14:39.885
Good afternoon.
We've been expecting you.

1046
01:14:47.685 --> 01:14:50.146
Oh.
Oh, thank you so much

1047
01:14:50.146 --> 01:14:51.480
for coming all this way.

1048
01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:55.359
Here it is. The scrapbook.

1049
01:14:55.359 --> 01:14:59.071
Um, relates back

1050
01:14:59.071 --> 01:15:02.283
to some time I spent in Prague
before the war.

1051
01:15:02.283 --> 01:15:03.659
It's a little heavy,
I'm afraid.

1052
01:15:06.203 --> 01:15:07.288
Yeah.

1053
01:15:09.081 --> 01:15:11.876
Now, a lot of that stuff
is just touristy stuff.

1054
01:15:11.876 --> 01:15:14.670
Postcards and so on
and so forth.

1055
01:15:14.670 --> 01:15:17.631
And, uh... Yes,
there are all... That's it.

1056
01:15:17.631 --> 01:15:18.966
There're some letters

1057
01:15:18.966 --> 01:15:21.510
relating to the transport
of children,

1058
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:23.471
- uh, to Britain.
- Ah.

1059
01:15:25.139 --> 01:15:27.016
These are
the eight children you saved?

1060
01:15:27.016 --> 01:15:29.310
No, no. It was
a few more than that.

1061
01:15:29.310 --> 01:15:31.687
If you turn the pages,
you can see.

1062
01:15:31.687 --> 01:15:34.398
I sent out those cards, uh
for people to,

1063
01:15:34.398 --> 01:15:36.275
uh, choose, you know?

1064
01:15:36.275 --> 01:15:38.235
And,  I must say
it was a bit like, um,

1065
01:15:38.235 --> 01:15:39.862
it was bit like selling
soap powder,

1066
01:15:39.862 --> 01:15:41.614
if you know what I mean.

1067
01:15:41.614 --> 01:15:43.449
I couldn't for the life of me
think how else I could,

1068
01:15:43.449 --> 01:15:46.327
uh, find enough families
to take in so many kids.

1069
01:15:46.327 --> 01:15:47.745
Uh, forgive me
but how many children

1070
01:15:47.745 --> 01:15:48.871
are we speaking about?

1071
01:15:48.871 --> 01:15:52.666
Oh. Uh...  669.

1072
01:15:52.666 --> 01:15:55.794
We successfully placed.

1073
01:15:55.794 --> 01:15:59.006
You... You... You brought
669 children

1074
01:15:59.006 --> 01:16:00.090
from Prague to England?

1075
01:16:00.090 --> 01:16:03.344
Well, I mean
with my colleagues

1076
01:16:03.344 --> 01:16:04.595
Doreen Warriner,

1077
01:16:04.595 --> 01:16:06.597
Trevor Chadwick,
and Hana and um...

1078
01:16:06.597 --> 01:16:08.807
But there were so many other
people involved, you know,

1079
01:16:08.807 --> 01:16:11.685
and my own mother.
She was a great help.

1080
01:16:11.685 --> 01:16:13.145
And I suppose...

1081
01:16:13.145 --> 01:16:14.855
I suppose
I'm the only one left, now.

1082
01:16:14.855 --> 01:16:16.565
At least I think I am.

1083
01:16:18.567 --> 01:16:20.528
Uh, the children
that are crossed out

1084
01:16:20.528 --> 01:16:22.238
are the ones
we found homes for.

1085
01:16:22.238 --> 01:16:25.241
And the faces
that are not crossed out?

1086
01:16:25.241 --> 01:16:27.576
Ah, well, they were
the less fortunate

1087
01:16:27.576 --> 01:16:31.163
and, uh, it was a lottery,
I'm afraid.

1088
01:16:35.459 --> 01:16:37.419
You wrote to the president
of the United States?

1089
01:16:37.419 --> 01:16:40.172
Fat lot of good
he was.

1090
01:16:40.172 --> 01:16:42.508
I never heard back
from him.

1091
01:16:42.508 --> 01:16:45.386
Yeah, it's disappointing,
I must say.

1092
01:16:45.386 --> 01:16:47.471
Oh, yes, now, these, uh...

1093
01:16:47.471 --> 01:16:50.099
Those there are the names
of the children

1094
01:16:50.099 --> 01:16:52.059
and their new addresses.

1095
01:16:54.061 --> 01:16:55.813
Excuse me, Mr Winton.

1096
01:16:55.813 --> 01:16:57.773
This is not exactly
what I was expecting.

1097
01:16:57.773 --> 01:16:59.024
I'm a little taken aback

1098
01:16:59.024 --> 01:17:01.193
at the scale
of your operation.

1099
01:17:01.193 --> 01:17:03.112
Oh. Oh, you know,

1100
01:17:03.112 --> 01:17:06.115
if we'd had
more money, more time

1101
01:17:06.115 --> 01:17:08.117
and more government support

1102
01:17:08.117 --> 01:17:10.202
we could've done a lot more,
I think.

1103
01:17:12.913 --> 01:17:13.956
Blank pages?

1104
01:17:15.124 --> 01:17:18.836
Yeah. That was the last train.

1105
01:17:20.629 --> 01:17:22.715
Something happened
to the last train?

1106
01:17:24.425 --> 01:17:28.053
Yes, it was the ninth train.

1107
01:17:28.053 --> 01:17:34.268
It was our largest group
of 250 children and uh...

1108
01:17:34.268 --> 01:17:37.521
<i>It was the 1st
of September, 1939.</i>

1109
01:17:37.521 --> 01:17:39.815
<i>The same day
that Hitler invaded Poland.</i>

1110
01:17:39.815 --> 01:17:41.525
<i>The very start of the war.</i>

1111
01:18:41.377 --> 01:18:42.878
Hana.

1112
01:18:42.878 --> 01:18:44.546
Trevor!

1113
01:18:44.546 --> 01:18:45.839
Hana!

1114
01:18:46.465 --> 01:18:47.466
Hana!

1115
01:18:52.805 --> 01:18:54.598
That was
the end of that.

1116
01:18:54.598 --> 01:18:56.433
Bloody Hitler,
that's all I can say.

1117
01:19:00.896 --> 01:19:03.649
We had hundreds
of foster families waiting,

1118
01:19:03.649 --> 01:19:05.442
ready to welcome them, but...

1119
01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:07.569
yeah.

1120
01:19:20.749 --> 01:19:21.750
<i>Merci.</i>

1121
01:19:30.426 --> 01:19:31.510
Take milk?

1122
01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:32.594
Uh, no, thank you.

1123
01:19:34.179 --> 01:19:35.305
Thank you.

1124
01:19:36.932 --> 01:19:38.559
That's wonderful. Thank you.

1125
01:19:44.022 --> 01:19:45.023
I'm sorry.

1126
01:19:47.818 --> 01:19:49.194
Must be very difficult for you

1127
01:19:49.194 --> 01:19:51.655
knowing what happened
to those children.

1128
01:19:51.655 --> 01:19:53.449
Well, I don't know
what happened, do I?

1129
01:19:53.449 --> 01:19:55.659
They were taken off the train,

1130
01:19:55.659 --> 01:19:57.828
returned to their families
and...

1131
01:19:59.163 --> 01:20:00.831
that was the end of that.

1132
01:20:02.583 --> 01:20:04.168
Surely, I'm almost certain

1133
01:20:04.168 --> 01:20:06.336
that they perished
in the camps?

1134
01:20:09.214 --> 01:20:10.340
Hmm.

1135
01:20:53.592 --> 01:20:57.805
Well, you may be right about
those children, Mrs Maxwell.

1136
01:20:57.805 --> 01:21:01.600
But I've learned to keep
my imagination in check.

1137
01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:03.352
Uh, so I can still be of use

1138
01:21:03.352 --> 01:21:05.187
and not go raving mad.

1139
01:21:10.859 --> 01:21:12.110
Mr Winton,

1140
01:21:13.654 --> 01:21:16.406
around 15,000 children

1141
01:21:16.406 --> 01:21:20.202
went into concentration camps
in Czechoslovakia

1142
01:21:20.202 --> 01:21:24.289
and, uh, less than 200
of them survived,

1143
01:21:24.289 --> 01:21:29.169
and you saved 669.

1144
01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:31.296
Oh.

1145
01:21:32.589 --> 01:21:34.716
Ah.

1146
01:21:34.716 --> 01:21:37.135
Anyway, I'd best, uh,
I'd better be going

1147
01:21:37.135 --> 01:21:39.721
because my wife is expecting
me and I don't want...

1148
01:21:39.721 --> 01:21:41.640
I don't want to get
into any trouble,

1149
01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:43.100
if you know what I mean.

1150
01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:44.476
I would like very much

1151
01:21:44.476 --> 01:21:46.895
to hold on to your scrapbook,
if I may.

1152
01:21:49.231 --> 01:21:52.359
- Well, all right.
- And...

1153
01:21:52.359 --> 01:21:57.406
with your permission, I would
like to show it to my husband.

1154
01:21:57.406 --> 01:22:01.410
I'm sure he will consider it
a very important story.

1155
01:22:02.369 --> 01:22:06.206
Oh. Well, thank you.

1156
01:22:06.206 --> 01:22:07.541
- Thank you.

1157
01:22:09.084 --> 01:22:10.377
As many
of you will know,

1158
01:22:10.377 --> 01:22:13.338
our group was founded in 1965

1159
01:22:13.338 --> 01:22:15.841
to encourage friendship
between Maidenhead

1160
01:22:15.841 --> 01:22:18.302
and its twin towns
across Europe.

1161
01:22:20.596 --> 01:22:25.017
We were met at the airport
by Maria Bechtler

1162
01:22:25.017 --> 01:22:27.728
and travelled by coach
to Bad Godesberg,

1163
01:22:27.728 --> 01:22:30.063
where we were given a warm...

1164
01:22:31.815 --> 01:22:32.816
All right?

1165
01:22:36.153 --> 01:22:39.197
Where we were given
a warm <i>Willkommen...</i>

1166
01:22:39.197 --> 01:22:40.949
- ...by our hostesses.

1167
01:23:07.267 --> 01:23:10.395
Thank you, darling.
Don't trip, it's heavy.

1168
01:23:10.395 --> 01:23:11.605
Hey, Steve.

1169
01:23:11.605 --> 01:23:12.731
Don't strain yourself,
will you?

1170
01:23:12.731 --> 01:23:14.483
Here. Let me.
- Give me a hand.

1171
01:23:14.483 --> 01:23:15.776
Oh, God.

1172
01:23:15.776 --> 01:23:17.319
I can't get over
all the space, Dad.

1173
01:23:17.319 --> 01:23:19.446
Hey, you could fit in
a playpen in here.

1174
01:23:19.446 --> 01:23:20.989
Oh, no.

1175
01:23:20.989 --> 01:23:23.325
- It looks lovely, doesn't it?

1176
01:23:23.325 --> 01:23:25.494
- Doesn't it?
- Yeah. Doesn't it, Dad?

1177
01:23:25.494 --> 01:23:26.662
- Yes.

1178
01:23:26.662 --> 01:23:27.955
Don't set it on fire.

1179
01:23:27.955 --> 01:23:29.247
Nicky!

1180
01:23:29.247 --> 01:23:30.624
Well, you did last year,
didn't you?

1181
01:23:30.624 --> 01:23:31.875
I did not.
- Yes, you did

1182
01:23:31.875 --> 01:23:32.960
- and the year before that.
- No.

1183
01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:34.169
He loves to tease, doesn't he?

1184
01:23:34.169 --> 01:23:35.587
- Huh?
- Oh, it looks lovely.

1185
01:23:35.587 --> 01:23:38.090
Some of them new, aren't they?

1186
01:23:38.090 --> 01:23:40.175
- Well, merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

1187
01:23:40.175 --> 01:23:41.134
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>
<i>Cheers.</i>

1188
01:23:55.399 --> 01:23:56.566
It's for you.

1189
01:23:56.566 --> 01:23:57.651
Oh.

1190
01:24:05.826 --> 01:24:07.786
Oh, this is interesting.

1191
01:24:07.786 --> 01:24:09.329
What is it?

1192
01:24:09.329 --> 01:24:11.665
It's from the Editor
of the <i>Sunday Mirror.</i>

1193
01:24:11.665 --> 01:24:14.710
"We would very much like
to publish a major article

1194
01:24:14.710 --> 01:24:17.337
"detailing
the child evacuation."

1195
01:24:17.337 --> 01:24:19.256
But... That's marvellous.

1196
01:24:19.256 --> 01:24:20.966
Oh, yes. It says,

1197
01:24:20.966 --> 01:24:22.968
"With wider publicity in mind,

1198
01:24:24.302 --> 01:24:25.762
"I have been talking

1199
01:24:25.762 --> 01:24:28.348
"to the BBC Television
programme <i>That's Life!"</i>

1200
01:24:28.348 --> 01:24:29.683
Surely not.

1201
01:24:29.683 --> 01:24:31.977
Yes, they want me
to go in and, uh,

1202
01:24:31.977 --> 01:24:33.770
check the historical accuracy.

1203
01:24:33.770 --> 01:24:36.648
But that's such a silly show.

1204
01:24:36.648 --> 01:24:37.774
- What?
<i>- That's Life!</i>

1205
01:24:37.774 --> 01:24:39.067
It's a very silly show.

1206
01:24:39.985 --> 01:24:41.069
It is.

1207
01:24:41.069 --> 01:24:42.320
Well, it's very popular,
isn't it?

1208
01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:44.322
I mean, a lot of people
watch it.

1209
01:24:45.365 --> 01:24:47.200
Should I come with you?

1210
01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:48.452
Why would you want
to come with me

1211
01:24:48.452 --> 01:24:49.786
if you think it's so silly?

1212
01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:03.341
Oh.

1213
01:25:05.761 --> 01:25:10.057
Hello. Hi, Mr Winton,
such a pleasure to meet you.

1214
01:25:10.057 --> 01:25:11.475
Just gonna take you
through here.

1215
01:25:11.475 --> 01:25:12.559
- Yes.
This way.

1216
01:25:14.978 --> 01:25:16.229
What exactly am I to do?

1217
01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:17.481
Oh, they're going
to explain all that.

1218
01:25:17.481 --> 01:25:19.232
- Oh.
- It's just through here.

1219
01:25:19.232 --> 01:25:20.358
All right.

1220
01:25:22.069 --> 01:25:23.070
Thank you.

1221
01:25:24.112 --> 01:25:25.113
Thanks.

1222
01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:34.081
Camera six.

1223
01:25:34.081 --> 01:25:35.749
Can you come
from the other side?

1224
01:25:37.250 --> 01:25:39.377
Thank you.

1225
01:25:39.377 --> 01:25:41.088
Thirty seconds
to on air.

1226
01:25:46.134 --> 01:25:49.763
Okay, and you are just here.

1227
01:25:49.763 --> 01:25:52.349
- Couldn't I sit farther back?
- I'm afraid not.

1228
01:25:52.349 --> 01:25:53.725
Oh, I'd rather be backstage.

1229
01:25:53.725 --> 01:25:55.143
I'm... I'm really,
really sorry.

1230
01:25:55.143 --> 01:25:56.394
It's just they told me
to put you here

1231
01:25:56.394 --> 01:25:57.687
and we're running out of time.

1232
01:25:57.687 --> 01:25:58.647
All right.

1233
01:26:09.157 --> 01:26:10.408
Who's that?

1234
01:26:29.177 --> 01:26:31.138
Hello. Good evening.

1235
01:26:39.229 --> 01:26:41.398
<i>And would you want
to be treated by this dentist</i>

1236
01:26:41.398 --> 01:26:45.026
<i>in Bath who goes
by the name Mr F Illing?</i>

1237
01:26:47.946 --> 01:26:48.947
<i>Esther.</i>

1238
01:26:50.407 --> 01:26:53.535
Now, an extraordinary story
has come to light

1239
01:26:53.535 --> 01:26:55.328
about a young man who,

1240
01:26:55.328 --> 01:26:57.873
many years ago,
visited Prague,

1241
01:26:57.873 --> 01:27:02.043
and what he found there
was a terrible situation.

1242
01:27:02.043 --> 01:27:04.212
Thousands
of refugees stranded,

1243
01:27:04.212 --> 01:27:06.631
living
in desperate conditions,

1244
01:27:06.631 --> 01:27:10.302
<i>and at the mercy of Hitler's
imminent invasion.</i>

1245
01:27:10.302 --> 01:27:13.513
<i>This young man, whose name
was Nicholas Winton,</i>

1246
01:27:13.513 --> 01:27:16.183
<i>decided that something
had to be done.</i>

1247
01:27:16.183 --> 01:27:20.770
And so he managed
to rescue 669 children.

1248
01:27:21.938 --> 01:27:23.356
This is his scrapbook.

1249
01:27:24.691 --> 01:27:29.446
All sorts
of fascinating photographs.

1250
01:27:30.655 --> 01:27:32.532
Perhaps you can see...

1251
01:27:34.075 --> 01:27:36.912
Here's a photograph of
Nicholas Winton himself,

1252
01:27:36.912 --> 01:27:39.998
with one of the children
he rescued.

1253
01:27:39.998 --> 01:27:44.085
But at the very back,
is a list

1254
01:27:44.085 --> 01:27:45.670
of all the children

1255
01:27:45.670 --> 01:27:47.505
<i>that he rescued.</i>

1256
01:27:47.505 --> 01:27:51.134
<i>Here is Vera Diamantova,
now Vera Gissing.</i>

1257
01:27:51.134 --> 01:27:54.179
We found her name on his list.

1258
01:27:54.179 --> 01:27:57.515
And Vera is here
with us tonight. Hello, Vera.

1259
01:27:57.515 --> 01:27:58.934
- Hello.
Now, I should tell

1260
01:27:58.934 --> 01:28:00.602
you that you are, in fact,
sitting next

1261
01:28:00.602 --> 01:28:02.687
to Mr Nicholas Winton.

1262
01:28:04.189 --> 01:28:05.232
Hello.

1263
01:28:07.317 --> 01:28:09.986
- Hello.

1264
01:28:18.328 --> 01:28:19.329
Thank you.

1265
01:28:34.594 --> 01:28:36.263
I was reunited
with my sister

1266
01:28:36.263 --> 01:28:38.181
a few years later.

1267
01:28:38.181 --> 01:28:39.933
And your parents?

1268
01:28:39.933 --> 01:28:43.395
My father was tortured,
in Terezin.

1269
01:28:43.395 --> 01:28:44.479
Mm-hmm.

1270
01:28:44.479 --> 01:28:47.065
And then sent to Auschwitz.

1271
01:28:49.442 --> 01:28:51.861
And then on
to another labour camp.

1272
01:28:51.861 --> 01:28:53.405
Ah.

1273
01:28:53.405 --> 01:28:54.781
A fellow prisoner told me

1274
01:28:54.781 --> 01:28:58.243
he thought he'd been shot
on the Death March.

1275
01:28:59.953 --> 01:29:00.954
Hmm.

1276
01:29:02.372 --> 01:29:05.208
My mother, um, died of typhus.

1277
01:29:06.793 --> 01:29:09.170
So sorry.
- Contracted at Belsen.

1278
01:29:10.964 --> 01:29:13.133
But she knew
that we were safe.

1279
01:29:13.133 --> 01:29:14.926
For a mother,
that is everything.

1280
01:29:17.971 --> 01:29:22.142
And, um, my cousins,
Honza and Tommy

1281
01:29:23.768 --> 01:29:25.478
were on the last train.

1282
01:29:27.355 --> 01:29:29.149
Yeah.

1283
01:29:29.149 --> 01:29:31.401
Though I never
saw them again, of course.

1284
01:30:03.224 --> 01:30:04.225
Nicky.

1285
01:30:15.862 --> 01:30:17.030
Nicky.

1286
01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:54.984
I'm sorry.

1287
01:31:07.705 --> 01:31:09.999
I'm sorry. Very sorry.

1288
01:31:09.999 --> 01:31:11.084
Don't.

1289
01:31:18.007 --> 01:31:19.008
I'll get it.

1290
01:31:24.305 --> 01:31:26.182
Nicky! You've not
called me back.

1291
01:31:26.182 --> 01:31:27.851
I left messages!

1292
01:31:27.851 --> 01:31:30.687
- Doesn't it follow that I don't
want to talk to you?
- Oh, come on, come on,
let me do a piece.

1293
01:31:30.687 --> 01:31:32.021
No, thanks.

1294
01:31:32.021 --> 01:31:34.149
Come on. It's such
a brilliant story, Nicky.

1295
01:31:34.149 --> 01:31:38.278
You're a hero. Nicky, please.
Please.

1296
01:31:38.278 --> 01:31:39.988
What...
It's not about me.

1297
01:31:39.988 --> 01:31:41.072
- Nicky, come on,

1298
01:31:41.072 --> 01:31:42.157
give me a chance.

1299
01:31:44.617 --> 01:31:46.202
Maidenhead, 3310.

1300
01:31:46.202 --> 01:31:47.745
<i>Hello, is
Mister Winton there, please?</i>

1301
01:31:47.745 --> 01:31:50.874
No, he's not available.
Can I ask who's calling?

1302
01:31:50.874 --> 01:31:53.793
<i>This is Katinka Blackford
from</i> That's Life!

1303
01:31:53.793 --> 01:31:55.837
Oh. Oh, I see.

1304
01:31:57.672 --> 01:32:00.967
Two more children, huh?

1305
01:32:00.967 --> 01:32:05.305
They... They phoned in
after last week's show.

1306
01:32:05.305 --> 01:32:07.807
Yeah.

1307
01:32:07.807 --> 01:32:11.352
They so
desperately want to meet you.

1308
01:32:15.857 --> 01:32:17.567
You don't have to do it.

1309
01:32:18.818 --> 01:32:19.819
Don't I?

1310
01:32:21.946 --> 01:32:24.657
I asked them to send
the children's details to us.

1311
01:32:26.034 --> 01:32:27.827
I won't have you
ambushed again.

1312
01:32:40.256 --> 01:32:41.966
Milena...

1313
01:32:41.966 --> 01:32:44.385
Well, goodness. This girl's
done very well for herself.

1314
01:32:44.385 --> 01:32:45.929
Yeah.

1315
01:32:45.929 --> 01:32:47.722
Milena is now
Lady Grenfell Baines.

1316
01:32:47.722 --> 01:32:49.265
Oh.

1317
01:32:49.265 --> 01:32:52.143
All right.

1318
01:32:56.689 --> 01:32:59.526
- Who's that?
Hanus.

1319
01:32:59.526 --> 01:33:01.986
Perhaps it's too much.
Perhaps you've done enough.

1320
01:33:01.986 --> 01:33:03.196
No, I...

1321
01:33:04.447 --> 01:33:06.991
I started
the whole thing, so...

1322
01:33:06.991 --> 01:33:08.409
I have to finish it.

1323
01:33:11.496 --> 01:33:15.250
Last week was incredible
for us here at <i>That's Life!</i>

1324
01:33:15.250 --> 01:33:18.753
We told a story that touched
the hearts of so many people.

1325
01:33:18.753 --> 01:33:22.173
We've been overwhelmed
by the response.

1326
01:33:22.173 --> 01:33:25.009
One of the people who was
very affected last week

1327
01:33:25.009 --> 01:33:27.345
is with us here tonight.

1328
01:33:27.345 --> 01:33:31.307
Milena Fleischmann,
now Lady Grenfell Baines,

1329
01:33:31.307 --> 01:33:35.395
was also one of the children
that Nicholas Winton rescued.

1330
01:33:35.395 --> 01:33:39.399
Milena, I understand
you still have the name tag

1331
01:33:39.399 --> 01:33:40.775
that you wore around your neck

1332
01:33:40.775 --> 01:33:43.695
when you arrived here
as a little girl.

1333
01:33:43.695 --> 01:33:47.031
Yes, I wore this
around my neck

1334
01:33:47.031 --> 01:33:50.577
and this is the actual pass

1335
01:33:50.577 --> 01:33:53.788
we were given
to come to England.

1336
01:33:53.788 --> 01:33:56.874
So, I am one of the children
that you saved.

1337
01:34:02.839 --> 01:34:06.009
Now, Mr Winton, having
introduced you to Milena,

1338
01:34:06.009 --> 01:34:09.178
there's somebody else that
we'd like to tell you about.

1339
01:34:09.178 --> 01:34:13.516
Hanus Schnabel was only 11
when he came over here.

1340
01:34:14.976 --> 01:34:16.144
We have his passport

1341
01:34:17.895 --> 01:34:20.982
with all the official
stamps in it.

1342
01:34:20.982 --> 01:34:23.484
I don't know
whether you can see,

1343
01:34:23.484 --> 01:34:26.029
but this is how he got here.

1344
01:34:26.029 --> 01:34:27.530
And he told us...

1345
01:34:27.530 --> 01:34:29.866
"I don't know how
my rescue was arranged.

1346
01:34:29.866 --> 01:34:32.493
"I had no idea when I left
my parents at Prague station

1347
01:34:32.493 --> 01:34:34.370
"that I would never
see them again.

1348
01:34:34.370 --> 01:34:36.372
"My older brother Franta
was supposed

1349
01:34:36.372 --> 01:34:38.082
"to come here by train
in September,

1350
01:34:38.082 --> 01:34:40.960
"but war broke out and I never
saw him again either.

1351
01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:43.504
"I hoped all through the war
that they would survive,

1352
01:34:43.504 --> 01:34:46.466
"but they were gassed
in a concentration camp.

1353
01:34:46.466 --> 01:34:48.426
"I've often wondered
who was responsible

1354
01:34:48.426 --> 01:34:50.178
"for organising my rescue.

1355
01:34:50.178 --> 01:34:51.596
"I would dearly love
to meet him

1356
01:34:51.596 --> 01:34:53.598
"and thank him
for helping us children

1357
01:34:53.598 --> 01:34:56.184
"without any hope
of acknowledgement."

1358
01:34:56.184 --> 01:34:59.812
Hanus' name is
on Mr Winton's list.

1359
01:34:59.812 --> 01:35:02.440
And Hanus is here
with us tonight.

1360
01:35:06.027 --> 01:35:07.236
Oh.

1361
01:35:07.236 --> 01:35:08.321
Thank you.

1362
01:35:11.658 --> 01:35:13.326
Now, I don't want
to rush you.

1363
01:35:13.326 --> 01:35:15.912
I know you've waited
a long time for this moment,

1364
01:35:15.912 --> 01:35:18.373
but you'll be able
to talk to Hanus later.

1365
01:35:19.999 --> 01:35:23.169
However, our evening
isn't quite over.

1366
01:35:27.256 --> 01:35:30.718
Can I ask, is there anyone
in the audience tonight

1367
01:35:30.718 --> 01:35:33.262
who owes their life
to Nicholas Winton?

1368
01:35:34.681 --> 01:35:36.808
If so, could you
stand up, please?

1369
01:35:56.035 --> 01:35:58.329
Mr Winton, would you like
to turn around?

1370
01:36:17.682 --> 01:36:19.267
You can meet
all of these people

1371
01:36:19.267 --> 01:36:22.270
properly after the programme.

1372
01:36:22.270 --> 01:36:27.275
In the meantime, Mr Winton,
on behalf of all of them,

1373
01:36:27.275 --> 01:36:29.152
thank you very much indeed.

1374
01:38:33.150 --> 01:38:34.485
See Grandpa?

1375
01:38:42.118 --> 01:38:44.745
- Hello. Hello, Vera. Come in.
- Oh, Nicky.

1376
01:38:44.745 --> 01:38:46.873
- Hello.

1377
01:38:46.873 --> 01:38:49.709
- Good, go through. Hello.
- Hi.

1378
01:38:49.709 --> 01:38:51.544
What's your name?
Hi,

1379
01:38:51.544 --> 01:38:53.379
- I'm Vera's daughter.
Hello.

1380
01:38:53.379 --> 01:38:54.672
Nice to meet you.
Hello. Come through.

1381
01:38:54.672 --> 01:38:56.132
This is
so beautiful.

1382
01:38:56.132 --> 01:38:57.508
Oh, this is Nicola.

1383
01:38:57.508 --> 01:38:59.010
- Oh, hello. Hello.
- My daughter.

1384
01:38:59.010 --> 01:39:00.636
And this is Rebecca,
my little grandchild.

1385
01:39:00.636 --> 01:39:02.221
- Wow. Hello.
Say, "Hello."

1386
01:39:02.221 --> 01:39:04.181
Hi. So, you do have a pool.

1387
01:39:04.181 --> 01:39:05.266
We do have a pool.

1388
01:39:06.684 --> 01:39:09.437
Nicky, turn the music down
a little bit, darling.

1389
01:39:14.191 --> 01:39:16.152
Hello, young man. Hello.

1390
01:39:16.152 --> 01:39:18.070
Right,
be careful, though.

1391
01:39:18.070 --> 01:39:19.155
Not too fast.

1392
01:39:19.155 --> 01:39:21.198
Oh, it's beautiful, isn't it?

1393
01:39:21.198 --> 01:39:22.658
Oh, my goodness.

1394
01:39:22.658 --> 01:39:23.993
Darling, you must
be really careful here.

1395
01:39:23.993 --> 01:39:26.787
Oh, you have
a lovely pool, Nicky.

1396
01:39:26.787 --> 01:39:28.372
Yeah. I like to swim.

1397
01:39:31.542 --> 01:39:32.752
- You remember?
- Mm.

1398
01:39:35.379 --> 01:39:36.505
You all got towels?
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1399
01:39:36.505 --> 01:39:38.549
Can we go in?
Yes!

1400
01:39:38.549 --> 01:39:40.301
What's the temperature like?

1401
01:39:40.301 --> 01:39:41.886
It's all right
if you're a penguin.

1402
01:39:43.930 --> 01:39:46.140
