1
00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:46.087
Everyone is born...

2
00:00:46.255 --> 00:00:48.589
...but not everyone
is born the same.

3
00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:52.969
Some will grow to be butchers
or bakers or candlestick makers.

4
00:00:53.137 --> 00:00:56.806
Some will only be really good
at making Jell-O salad.

5
00:00:56.974 --> 00:01:01.018
One way or another, though,
every human being is unique...

6
00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:06.357
...for better or for worse.
Most parents believe their children...

7
00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:09.360
...are the most beautiful creatures
ever to grace the planet.

8
00:01:09.695 --> 00:01:11.571
Others take a less emotional approach.

9
00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:13.656
- What a waste of time.
- And painful.

10
00:01:13.824 --> 00:01:16.534
And expensive.
$9.25 for a bar of soap?

11
00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:19.787
Well, I had to take a shower, Harry.
$5000?

12
00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:22.999
I'm not paying it. What are they
gonna do, repossess the kid?

13
00:01:39.558 --> 00:01:41.184
- There's no way out.
- Make a U-turn.

14
00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:42.393
All right.

15
00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:50.485
- Harry!
- All right.

16
00:01:51.487 --> 00:01:53.029
Harry!

17
00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:54.572
The Wormwood guy's back!

18
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.407
Harry and Zinnia Wormwood...

19
00:01:56.575 --> 00:01:59.494
...lived in a very nice neighborhood,
in a very nice house.

20
00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:02.455
But they were not really
very nice people.

21
00:02:12.758 --> 00:02:15.259
Get out of the street, you little dodos!

22
00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:25.019
The Wormwoods were so
wrapped up in their own silly lives...

23
00:02:25.187 --> 00:02:27.438
...that they barely noticed
they had a daughter.

24
00:02:27.606 --> 00:02:29.816
Had they paid any attention
to her at all...

25
00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:33.319
...they'd have realized
she was a rather extraordinary child.

26
00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:35.863
Oh, my gosh, Matilda,
now look what you did!

27
00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:38.407
They named her Matilda.

28
00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:41.911
You're supposed to eat the spinach.

29
00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:52.588
Babies!

30
00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:55.633
You're better off raising tomatoes.

31
00:02:56.218 --> 00:02:57.885
By the time she was 2...

32
00:02:58.053 --> 00:03:01.389
...Matilda had learned what most
people learn in their early 30s:

33
00:03:01.557 --> 00:03:03.724
How to take care of herself.

34
00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:11.274
As time went by,
she developed a sense of style.

35
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.902
Every morning, Matilda's brother,
Michael, went to school.

36
00:03:15.112 --> 00:03:16.362
- Bye, Mom.
- Get out of here.

37
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.407
- Her father worked selling used cars...
- Make money.

38
00:03:19.575 --> 00:03:22.660
...for unfair prices.
And her mother took off to play bingo.

39
00:03:22.828 --> 00:03:25.913
Soup's on the stove.
Heat it up if you get hungry.

40
00:03:26.123 --> 00:03:28.291
Matilda was left alone.

41
00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:31.669
That was how she liked it.

42
00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:11.375
By the time she was 4, Matilda had
read every magazine in the house.

43
00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:13.836
One night, she got up her courage...

44
00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:17.715
...and asked her father for something
she desperately wanted.

45
00:04:17.883 --> 00:04:20.676
A book?
What do you want a book for?

46
00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:22.178
To read.

47
00:04:22.346 --> 00:04:25.598
To read? Why would you wanna read
when you got the television set...

48
00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:27.850
...sitting right in front of you?

49
00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:33.022
There's nothing you can get from a book
you can't get from a television faster.

50
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.941
Get out of the way!

51
00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:39.946
Matilda already knew that she was
somewhat different from her family.

52
00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:42.782
She saw that whatever
she needed in this world...

53
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.951
...she'd have to get herself.

54
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.119
- Bye.
- Ciao.

55
00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:50.164
There's fish fingers
in the microwave.

56
00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:56.087
The next morning,
after her parents left...

57
00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:58.673
...Matilda set off
in search of a book.

58
00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:40.214
Where are the children's books, please?

59
00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:42.091
In that room right over there.

60
00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:45.386
Would you like me to pick you out one
with lots of pictures in it?

61
00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:49.348
No, thank you.
I'm sure I can manage.

62
00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:09.035
From then on, every day,
as soon as her mother went to bingo...

63
00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:12.913
...Matilda walked
the 10 blocks to the library

64
00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:16.917
...and devoured
one book after another.

65
00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:23.424
When she finished
all the children's books...

66
00:06:23.592 --> 00:06:26.635
...she started wandering around
in search of something else.

67
00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:29.722
Mrs. Phelps, who had been
watching her with fascination...

68
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.348
...for the past few weeks...

69
00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:34.518
...offered Matilda some valuable
library information.

70
00:06:34.686 --> 00:06:37.521
You know, you could have
your very own library card.

71
00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:40.066
And then you could take books home...

72
00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:43.235
...and you wouldn't have
to walk here every day.

73
00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:45.571
You could take as many as you like.

74
00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:48.115
That would be wonderful.

75
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.246
So Matilda's strong, young mind
continued to grow...

76
00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:57.166
...nurtured by the voices
of all those authors...

77
00:06:57.334 --> 00:06:59.835
...who had sent their books
out into the world...

78
00:07:00.003 --> 00:07:02.963
...like ships onto the sea.

79
00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:15.392
These books gave Matilda
a hopeful and comforting message:

80
00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:17.686
You are not alone.

81
00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:39.542
Any packages come today?

82
00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:43.712
Where did all this come from?

83
00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:45.881
The library.

84
00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:50.219
The library? You've never set foot in
a library. You're only 4 years old.

85
00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:51.762
Six and a half.

86
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.472
- You're 4.
- Six and a half.

87
00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.058
If you were 6 and a half,
you'd be in school already.

88
00:07:56.226 --> 00:08:00.229
I want to be in school. I told you I was
supposed to start school in September.

89
00:08:00.397 --> 00:08:01.689
You wouldn't listen.

90
00:08:02.357 --> 00:08:04.567
Get up. Get up!

91
00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:08.028
Get out here.
Give me that book.

92
00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:13.742
- Dearest pie, how old is Matilda?
- Four.

93
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.829
- I'm 6 and a half, Mommy.
- Five, then.

94
00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:19.415
- I was 6 in August.
- You're a liar.

95
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:22.918
- I wanna go to school.
- School!

96
00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:26.338
Out of the question. Who would be here
to sign for the packages?

97
00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:29.592
We can't leave valuable packages
sitting out on the doorstep.

98
00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:32.428
Now, go watch TV like a good kid.

99
00:08:32.596 --> 00:08:35.973
You know, sometimes I think
there's something wrong with that girl.

100
00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:38.684
Tell me about it.

101
00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:40.686
Hey, dip-face...

102
00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:44.273
...have a marshmallow.
Have another marshmallow, dip-face!

103
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.734
Dip-face!

104
00:08:54.618 --> 00:08:57.286
Sometimes Matilda longed for a friend.

105
00:08:57.454 --> 00:09:01.081
Someone like the kind,
courageous people in her books.

106
00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:04.627
It occurred to her that
like talking dragons and princesses...

107
00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:10.424
...with hair long enough to climb, such
people might exist only in storybooks.

108
00:09:10.634 --> 00:09:14.345
But Matilda was about to discover
that she could be her own friend.

109
00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:17.389
That she had a kind of strength
she wasn't even aware of.

110
00:09:17.933 --> 00:09:20.517
I'm great! I'm incredible!

111
00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:23.145
Michael, pencil and paper,
in the kitchen.

112
00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:25.898
Did we sell some cars today,
honeydew?

113
00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:27.358
Did we!

114
00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:29.443
Does that mean
I can get that new TV?

115
00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:32.780
Yeah. Son, one day you're gonna
have to earn your own living.

116
00:09:32.948 --> 00:09:35.032
It's time you learned
the family business.

117
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.618
Sit down. Write this down.

118
00:09:38.245 --> 00:09:43.123
All right. The first car
your brilliant father sold cost $320.

119
00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:46.961
I sold it for $1158.

120
00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:49.672
The second one cost $512.

121
00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:55.010
I sold it for $2269.

122
00:09:55.178 --> 00:09:57.513
- Wait, Dad, you're going too fast.
- Just write.

123
00:09:57.681 --> 00:10:03.018
The third cost $68. I sold it for $999.

124
00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:07.189
And the fourth cost $1100.

125
00:10:07.357 --> 00:10:13.279
I sold it for 7839
big American boffos.

126
00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:15.948
- Harry!
- What was my profit for the day?

127
00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:20.327
- Could you repeat the last one...?
- $10,265.

128
00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:25.374
Check it if you don't believe me.

129
00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:31.839
You're a little cheat.
You saw the paper.

130
00:10:32.007 --> 00:10:33.674
From all the way over here?

131
00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:37.136
Are you being smart with me?

132
00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:41.432
If you're being smart with me,
young lady, you're gonna be punished.

133
00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:43.892
Punished for being smart?

134
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.020
For being a smart aleck.

135
00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:49.982
When a person is bad, that person
has to be taught a lesson.

136
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.067
- Person?
- Get up!

137
00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:54.528
- Get up.
- Harry Wormwood...

138
00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:56.947
...had unintentionally
given his daughter...

139
00:10:57.115 --> 00:10:59.867
...the first practical advice
she could use.

140
00:11:00.035 --> 00:11:02.661
He meant to say,
"When a child is bad."

141
00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:05.456
Instead he said,
"When a person is bad."

142
00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:09.126
And thereby introduced
a revolutionary idea...

143
00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:12.463
...that children could
punish their parents.

144
00:11:14.299 --> 00:11:16.675
Only when they deserved it,
of course.

145
00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:38.674
Michael, come into my room.

146
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:42.636
What?

147
00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:46.682
My boy, today's the day I take you
to the shop. What do you say?

148
00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.059
I don't know.
What do you say, Dad?

149
00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:51.687
I say appearance
is nine-tenths of the law.

150
00:12:51.855 --> 00:12:53.897
People don't buy a car,
they buy me.

151
00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:57.025
Which is why I personally
take such pride in my appearance.

152
00:12:57.193 --> 00:13:00.654
Well-oiled hair,
clean shaved, snappy suit.

153
00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:03.949
Now, run along and get ready
for a big day of learning, kid.

154
00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:06.243
It's gonna be a big day
of learning too.

155
00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:09.872
There's a sucker born every minute.
We're gonna take them for all they got.

156
00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.207
Give me the cookies.

157
00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:14.168
Here.

158
00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:22.885
Okay, my boy, heir to the throne.

159
00:13:23.052 --> 00:13:25.721
Today we diddle the customer.

160
00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:28.891
What's wrong with you?
What are you looking at?

161
00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:31.685
Lovekins, where's my breakfast?

162
00:13:31.853 --> 00:13:34.521
Here we are, my heartstrings.

163
00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:39.568
Snickerdoodle,
what did you do to your hair?

164
00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:44.364
My hair?

165
00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:58.754
Give me those things. Give me that.
Where are you going with those?

166
00:13:58.922 --> 00:14:01.256
Give me those.
Get in the car. Go on.

167
00:14:04.761 --> 00:14:06.929
- Get in.
- Dirty dealings...

168
00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:11.350
...like buying stolen car parts,
never stay secret for long.

169
00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:14.603
Especially when the FBI
gets involved.

170
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:24.404
9: 17, suspect exits domicile.

171
00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:26.448
I've got 9:18.

172
00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:30.285
9: 17 is correct.

173
00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:44.633
Michael, one day
all this will be yours.

174
00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:46.510
This?

175
00:14:46.678 --> 00:14:49.805
See this junker? I paid $100 for it.

176
00:14:49.973 --> 00:14:52.099
She's got 120,000 miles on her.

177
00:14:52.267 --> 00:14:55.185
Transmission shot,
bumpers have fallen off.

178
00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:57.271
What do I do with her?

179
00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:00.566
I sell her.

180
00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:03.193
We really should weld
these bumpers on...

181
00:15:03.361 --> 00:15:07.155
...but that takes time,
equipment, money.

182
00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:09.366
So we use
Super Super Glue instead.

183
00:15:10.994 --> 00:15:13.370
Go ahead, put it on there.

184
00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:15.122
Won't it fall off?

185
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.333
- Definitely.
- Isn't that dangerous?

186
00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:20.627
Not to me, okay?

187
00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:22.296
Transmission.

188
00:15:22.463 --> 00:15:26.675
The sawdust quiets the gears, and lets
the engine run as sweet as a nut...

189
00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:29.344
...for a couple of miles.
- Daddy, that's cheating.

190
00:15:29.512 --> 00:15:33.015
Of course it's cheating.
Nobody ever got rich being honest.

191
00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:36.184
20 years ago, we could turn
the numbers back by hand. But...

192
00:15:36.352 --> 00:15:38.353
Here, take my hat.

193
00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:42.899
But the feds like to test the ingenuity
of the American businessman.

194
00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:44.651
Two-directional drill.

195
00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:47.279
You run it backwards,
the numbers go down.

196
00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:49.656
Watch the speedometer.

197
00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:52.367
Cool.

198
00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:55.621
- See?
- Yeah.

199
00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:57.831
Daddy, you're a crook.

200
00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:01.126
- What?
- This is illegal.

201
00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:03.337
Here, keep drilling.

202
00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:07.924
Do you make money?
Do you have a job?

203
00:16:08.092 --> 00:16:10.469
No, but don't people need good cars?

204
00:16:10.637 --> 00:16:13.305
Can't you sell good cars, Dad?

205
00:16:14.057 --> 00:16:16.016
Listen, you little wiseacre.

206
00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:19.811
I'm smart, you're dumb. I'm big,
you're little. I'm right, you're wrong.

207
00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:22.230
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

208
00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:37.996
Harry, I won! I won!

209
00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:41.083
I hit the double bingo!

210
00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:45.337
Come on, everybody!
I'm taking you all to Café Le Ritz.

211
00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:47.381
- Let me see the money.
- Never mind.

212
00:16:47.548 --> 00:16:49.341
Double bingo, huh?

213
00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:53.011
God, your hair looks awful.
I hope they let you in.

214
00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:55.180
- They'll let me in.
- Here's your hat, Daddy.

215
00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:57.224
Get in the car.

216
00:16:58.476 --> 00:16:59.935
Go on, get in.

217
00:17:02.146 --> 00:17:03.188
How much?

218
00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:05.857
It's for me to know
and you to find out.

219
00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:13.073
- It's nice to go out sometimes.
- Yeah.

220
00:17:13.241 --> 00:17:14.282
You never take us out.

221
00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:16.201
Of course I do.
I took you to the Flipper.

222
00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.704
- I don't remember any of the Flipper.
- The fish joint.

223
00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:20.372
You found that comb
in the bouillabaisse.

224
00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:23.125
Oh, yeah. I like that joint.

225
00:17:23.626 --> 00:17:25.585
Bonjour. This way, please.

226
00:17:25.753 --> 00:17:27.254
Harry, take your hat off.

227
00:17:28.256 --> 00:17:29.840
- I can't.
- This is a nice place.

228
00:17:30.007 --> 00:17:31.842
You can't wear a hat inside.

229
00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:33.135
I can't take it off.

230
00:17:33.302 --> 00:17:36.138
Harry, nobody cares
what your hair looks like.

231
00:17:36.305 --> 00:17:39.516
- What's with this hat?
- I can't get it off. I can't get it off.

232
00:17:41.018 --> 00:17:44.271
Just a minute. I'm gonna yank
this hat off. I'm pulling it.

233
00:17:46.774 --> 00:17:49.109
I think your head
swelled up really bad.

234
00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.531
- You're pulling the skin!
- You're such a baby! Stop it!

235
00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:57.159
- Fibers are fused to the head!
- Fibers are fused?

236
00:17:57.326 --> 00:18:00.245
What is that supposed to mean?
Give me that hat!

237
00:18:33.488 --> 00:18:35.864
I will not be the figure of ridicule!

238
00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:38.241
I want respect, and I want it now!

239
00:18:40.203 --> 00:18:42.913
I still don't see how you
glued your hat on, Harry.

240
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.707
I mean, I know you say you didn't,
but obviously you did.

241
00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:48.335
I did not glue my hat to my head.

242
00:18:48.503 --> 00:18:52.672
The hat shrunk,
the fibers fused to my hair.

243
00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:55.258
Baby, wait a minute.
I'm getting it now.

244
00:18:55.426 --> 00:18:57.219
I'm getting it. One more.

245
00:18:59.806 --> 00:19:01.348
Oh, my God.

246
00:19:10.691 --> 00:19:13.819
From now on, this family
does exactly what I say...

247
00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:16.404
...when, exactly when, I say it!

248
00:19:16.572 --> 00:19:19.074
- Here's your hat, Harry.
- Give me that.

249
00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:21.159
And right now...

250
00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:24.704
...we are eating dinner
and watching TV.

251
00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:30.585
Are you ready to get
sticky with Mickey?

252
00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:33.588
Shut your light off.

253
00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:36.758
I'm just giving it away!

254
00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:40.929
But for those idiots out there who don't
know how to play, here's how it goes.

255
00:19:41.097 --> 00:19:45.433
For each correct answer, they'll move
one step closer to our cube of cash.

256
00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:49.521
Once in our cube of cash, any money
that sticks to your gooey body...

257
00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:51.857
...you get to take home.

258
00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:56.653
Hi, Dad.

259
00:19:56.821 --> 00:19:58.238
Are you in this family?

260
00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.285
Hello?

261
00:20:03.452 --> 00:20:06.037
Are you in this family?

262
00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:12.335
Dinnertime is family time.
What is this trash you're reading?

263
00:20:12.628 --> 00:20:14.796
It's not trash, Daddy, it's lovely.

264
00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:17.215
It's called Moby Dick,
by Herman Melville.

265
00:20:18.134 --> 00:20:19.551
Moby what?

266
00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:26.016
- This is filth! Trash! Here.
- It's not mine! It's a library book.

267
00:20:26.183 --> 00:20:27.726
Trash!

268
00:20:27.894 --> 00:20:32.105
I'm fed up with all this reading! You're
a Wormwood, you start acting like one!

269
00:20:32.273 --> 00:20:33.607
Sit up and look at the TV.

270
00:20:33.774 --> 00:20:37.485
Producers are not liable for any skin
irritation that may result from playing.

271
00:20:37.653 --> 00:20:39.779
Get real sticky and get cash for free.

272
00:20:39.947 --> 00:20:43.241
All right, that's enough.
Let's get sticky!

273
00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:22.656
I didn't do it.

274
00:21:22.823 --> 00:21:25.659
Of course you didn't do it,
you little twit.

275
00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:28.328
I told you that was a cheap set.

276
00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:32.207
It's not a cheap set, it's a stolen set.

277
00:21:32.375 --> 00:21:34.084
Put your light on!

278
00:21:36.045 --> 00:21:37.087
Bummer.

279
00:21:37.254 --> 00:21:39.214
Was it magic or coincidence?

280
00:21:39.382 --> 00:21:40.882
She didn't know.

281
00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:44.761
It is said that we humans use
only a tiny portion of our brains.

282
00:21:44.929 --> 00:21:48.431
Matilda might never have discovered
her own great strength of mind...

283
00:21:48.599 --> 00:21:52.268
...were it not for the events
that began on the very next day.

284
00:21:52.436 --> 00:21:54.854
I need a car,
inexpensive but reliable.

285
00:21:55.022 --> 00:21:57.691
- Can you service me?
- In a manner of speaking, yes.

286
00:21:57.858 --> 00:21:59.275
Welcome to Wormwood Motors.

287
00:21:59.443 --> 00:22:01.695
Harry Wormwood,
owner, founder, whatever.

288
00:22:01.862 --> 00:22:05.782
Agatha Trunchbull, principal,
Crunchem Hall Elementary School.

289
00:22:06.242 --> 00:22:09.744
I warn you, sir, I want a tight car,
because I run a tight ship.

290
00:22:09.912 --> 00:22:13.832
- Oh, yeah, huh? Well, uh...
- My school is a model of discipline.

291
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.085
"Use the rod, beat the child,"
that's my motto.

292
00:22:17.253 --> 00:22:19.587
- Terrific motto.
- You have brats yourself?

293
00:22:19.755 --> 00:22:22.173
Yeah, I got a boy, Mikey,
and one mistake, Matilda.

294
00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:26.469
They're all mistakes, children. Filthy,
nasty things. Glad I never was one.

295
00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:30.140
Well, since you're an educator,
I'm gonna make you a great deal.

296
00:22:30.307 --> 00:22:32.851
- You had better.
- Let's do business.

297
00:22:34.687 --> 00:22:36.187
Thank you.

298
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.939
Enjoy it.

299
00:22:38.774 --> 00:22:41.192
- Hey, you, you're going to school.
- I am?

300
00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.194
First thing tomorrow.

301
00:22:43.654 --> 00:22:47.407
Yeah, yeah, okay, okay. You'll get
a real education at this place.

302
00:22:49.869 --> 00:22:54.039
Matilda had always wanted to go
to school because she loved to learn.

303
00:22:54.582 --> 00:22:57.834
She tried to imagine
what her new school would be like.

304
00:22:58.002 --> 00:22:59.794
Go ahead.

305
00:23:00.087 --> 00:23:03.131
She pictured a lovely
building surrounded by trees...

306
00:23:03.299 --> 00:23:05.216
...and flowers and swings.

307
00:23:07.928 --> 00:23:09.929
Well, there was a building...

308
00:23:10.139 --> 00:23:11.806
...and children.

309
00:23:11.974 --> 00:23:14.601
So regardless of what
Crunchem Hall looked like...

310
00:23:14.769 --> 00:23:16.478
...she was happy to be there.

311
00:23:16.645 --> 00:23:17.979
Hey, wait up!

312
00:23:18.439 --> 00:23:22.484
After all, any school
is better than no school at all.

313
00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.652
Isn't it?

314
00:23:58.896 --> 00:24:00.271
You, detention.

315
00:24:06.612 --> 00:24:08.696
You're too small.
Grow up quicker!

316
00:24:12.034 --> 00:24:13.910
Heads up! Shoulders back!
Stomachs in! Stand straight.

317
00:24:14.078 --> 00:24:15.286
- Hey.
- Sorry.

318
00:24:15.454 --> 00:24:16.496
Detention for you.

319
00:24:16.664 --> 00:24:19.707
That's okay. It's much better
than being out there.

320
00:24:19.875 --> 00:24:21.167
Is that my teacher?

321
00:24:21.335 --> 00:24:23.753
No, that's the principal,
Miss Trunchbull.

322
00:24:23.921 --> 00:24:25.880
You've gotta be kidding.

323
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:28.675
You squirts better skedaddle.
I'm not kidding.

324
00:24:28.843 --> 00:24:31.719
The Trunchbull likes to snap a whip
in there to see who's trying to hide.

325
00:24:31.887 --> 00:24:33.429
Stomach in!

326
00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:35.765
Change those socks! Too pink.

327
00:24:35.933 --> 00:24:37.517
- I'm Matilda.
- Lavender.

328
00:24:38.144 --> 00:24:39.853
- I'm Hortensia.
- Hi.

329
00:24:40.146 --> 00:24:43.898
She doesn't really hit children
with that riding crop, does she?

330
00:24:44.066 --> 00:24:46.192
No, it's mostly for scare.

331
00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.069
What she does is worse.

332
00:24:48.237 --> 00:24:52.031
Like yesterday, in the second grade,
the Trunchbull makes a weekly visit...

333
00:24:52.199 --> 00:24:54.284
...to every classroom
to show the teachers...

334
00:24:54.451 --> 00:24:56.494
...a thing or two about handling kids.

335
00:24:56.662 --> 00:24:58.079
And Julius Rottwinkle ate...

336
00:24:58.247 --> 00:25:01.124
...two M&M's during her lesson.
- And she caught him?

337
00:25:01.292 --> 00:25:02.917
Of course.

338
00:25:08.841 --> 00:25:12.135
Was Julius okay?
After being thrown out the window?

339
00:25:12.303 --> 00:25:15.722
Of course he wasn't okay.
He lived, if that's what you mean.

340
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:18.725
The Trunchbull used
to be in the Olympics.

341
00:25:18.893 --> 00:25:21.811
Shot put, javelin, hammer throw.

342
00:25:21.979 --> 00:25:23.605
The hammer throw is her specialty.

343
00:25:23.772 --> 00:25:27.108
- So she does this all the time?
- Better than being put in the choky.

344
00:25:27.276 --> 00:25:30.028
- Choky?
- Yeah, the choky.

345
00:25:30.196 --> 00:25:33.031
It's a tall, narrow hole
in the wall behind a door.

346
00:25:33.199 --> 00:25:36.034
You have to stand
in a drippy pipe with jagged edges.

347
00:25:36.202 --> 00:25:38.745
And the walls have broken glass
and nails sticking out.

348
00:25:38.913 --> 00:25:41.789
Get inside,
you festering ball of pus!

349
00:25:41.957 --> 00:25:44.459
- She puts kids in there?
- I've been in twice.

350
00:25:44.627 --> 00:25:46.836
Sometimes she leaves you
in there all day.

351
00:25:47.004 --> 00:25:49.797
- Didn't you tell your parents?
- They didn't believe me.

352
00:25:50.007 --> 00:25:52.342
I mean, would your parents
believe it?

353
00:25:52.509 --> 00:25:55.303
Sixty lines after school:
"I must obey Miss Trunchbull."

354
00:25:55.888 --> 00:25:57.430
No.

355
00:25:57.598 --> 00:25:59.807
- Out of my way.
- Here she comes.

356
00:26:03.479 --> 00:26:05.813
Fresh meat.

357
00:26:12.488 --> 00:26:14.614
Amanda Thripp.

358
00:26:15.908 --> 00:26:17.325
Yes, Miss Trunchbull.

359
00:26:17.618 --> 00:26:20.328
- What are those?
- What's what, Miss Trunchbull?

360
00:26:20.579 --> 00:26:23.331
Hanging down by your ears.

361
00:26:23.499 --> 00:26:24.999
You mean my pigtails?

362
00:26:26.543 --> 00:26:30.338
- Are you a pig, Amanda?
- No, Miss Trunchbull.

363
00:26:30.798 --> 00:26:33.508
Do I allow pigs in my school?

364
00:26:33.676 --> 00:26:36.928
My mommy thinks they're sweet.

365
00:26:37.263 --> 00:26:39.847
Your mommy is a twit!

366
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:44.477
You'll chop those off
before school tomorrow or I will...

367
00:26:44.853 --> 00:26:46.229
- But...
- But?!

368
00:26:46.397 --> 00:26:49.107
- I don't...
- But? Did you say "but"?

369
00:26:49.692 --> 00:26:51.025
- Hammer throw.
- What?

370
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.819
Definitely.

371
00:26:52.987 --> 00:26:55.029
I'll give you "but"!

372
00:27:04.957 --> 00:27:08.293
- Good loft!
- And excellent release.

373
00:27:12.339 --> 00:27:15.049
- Think she'll make the fence?
- Gonna be a close one.

374
00:27:36.447 --> 00:27:39.574
Quiet! Get to class
before I throw you all in the choky.

375
00:27:40.242 --> 00:27:41.951
Lavender.

376
00:27:42.119 --> 00:27:43.703
What's my teacher like?

377
00:27:44.163 --> 00:27:47.915
Run, run, run. Faster! Get in.

378
00:27:48.292 --> 00:27:49.584
Quickly!

379
00:27:49.752 --> 00:27:51.711
But Matilda's teacher, Miss Honey...

380
00:27:51.879 --> 00:27:53.880
...was one of those
remarkable people...

381
00:27:54.048 --> 00:27:57.925
...who appreciates every single child
for who she or he is.

382
00:27:58.093 --> 00:28:00.094
I scooped these up for you,
Miss Honey.

383
00:28:00.262 --> 00:28:03.598
Oh, how lovely. Thank you, Amanda.

384
00:28:03.891 --> 00:28:07.810
Okay, listen up, everybody.
We have a new student with us today.

385
00:28:07.978 --> 00:28:11.522
This is Matilda Wormwood. I'd like
you to sit over here with Lavender.

386
00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:14.567
Now, you all remember how scary
your first days at school were.

387
00:28:14.735 --> 00:28:19.155
So I'd like you to be especially nice
to Matilda and make her feel welcome.

388
00:28:19.323 --> 00:28:20.740
Could you get her
workbook for her, please?

389
00:28:20.908 --> 00:28:23.659
- Yes, Miss Honey.
- You can sit down.

390
00:28:24.328 --> 00:28:27.789
Miss Honey was a wonderful
teacher and a friend to everyone.

391
00:28:27.956 --> 00:28:31.292
But her life was not as simple
and beautiful as it seemed.

392
00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:34.295
Miss Honey had a deep,
dark secret.

393
00:28:34.463 --> 00:28:36.297
Though it caused her great pain...

394
00:28:36.465 --> 00:28:39.550
...she did not let it interfere
with her teaching.

395
00:28:40.427 --> 00:28:43.471
Well, Matilda, you've come
on a very good day...

396
00:28:43.639 --> 00:28:47.141
...because we're going to review
everything that we've learned so far.

397
00:28:47.518 --> 00:28:50.478
Now, it's all right if you don't understand
any of this because you're brand-new.

398
00:28:50.646 --> 00:28:53.815
But if you do know an answer,
just raise your hand. Okay?

399
00:28:54.191 --> 00:28:57.151
All right. We've been working
on our two-times tables.

400
00:28:57.319 --> 00:28:59.404
Would anyone like to demonstrate?

401
00:29:00.781 --> 00:29:02.073
Okay.

402
00:29:02.241 --> 00:29:04.325
Let's do some together.

403
00:29:06.829 --> 00:29:09.664
- Two times four is?
- Eight.

404
00:29:09.832 --> 00:29:13.126
- Two times six is?
- Twelve.

405
00:29:13.502 --> 00:29:15.795
- Two times nine is?
- Eighteen.

406
00:29:15.963 --> 00:29:18.172
Excellent! You've been practicing.

407
00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:20.675
Pretty soon you'll be able to do
any multiplication...

408
00:29:20.843 --> 00:29:23.428
...whether it's two times seven...
- Fourteen.

409
00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:27.181
Very good. Or 13 times 379.

410
00:29:27.349 --> 00:29:31.018
4927.

411
00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:34.355
I beg your pardon?

412
00:29:34.523 --> 00:29:36.858
I think that's the answer.

413
00:29:37.025 --> 00:29:40.361
13 times 379.

414
00:29:40.529 --> 00:29:42.029
4-9-2-7.

415
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:02.216
It is.

416
00:30:08.348 --> 00:30:11.058
Matilda, you know how
to multiply big numbers?

417
00:30:11.685 --> 00:30:15.688
I read this book last year
on mathematics at the library.

418
00:30:17.983 --> 00:30:19.650
You like to read?

419
00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:22.069
Oh, yes, I love to read.

420
00:30:22.362 --> 00:30:23.821
What do you like to read?

421
00:30:25.699 --> 00:30:29.827
Everything, but lately I've been reading
Darles Chickens.

422
00:30:31.079 --> 00:30:34.874
Charles Dickens.
I could read him every day.

423
00:30:36.251 --> 00:30:38.085
So could I.

424
00:30:41.131 --> 00:30:42.465
All right, everyone...

425
00:30:42.633 --> 00:30:46.135
...take out your workbooks
and let's start with section three.

426
00:30:54.102 --> 00:30:55.770
I'll be back in a moment.

427
00:31:08.867 --> 00:31:11.661
Gotcha right in the neck! And you.

428
00:31:13.455 --> 00:31:16.290
Yes! You... Come in, come in,
whoever you are.

429
00:31:20.128 --> 00:31:22.463
Almost got you.

430
00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:27.134
Good to see you, Jen.
Good, good, good.

431
00:31:27.302 --> 00:31:30.471
Time for one of our
little heart-to-hearts?

432
00:31:33.892 --> 00:31:37.353
Actually, it's about the new girl
in my class, Miss Trunchbull...

433
00:31:37.521 --> 00:31:39.146
...Matilda Wormwood.

434
00:31:39.314 --> 00:31:42.149
- Her father says she's a real wart.
- A what?

435
00:31:42.317 --> 00:31:45.778
A carbuncle, a blister,
a festering pustule of malignant ooze.

436
00:31:45.946 --> 00:31:51.033
Oh, no, Matilda Wormwood
is a very sweet girl, and very bright.

437
00:31:51.201 --> 00:31:52.785
A bright child?

438
00:31:52.953 --> 00:31:55.246
Yes. She can multiply
large sums in her head.

439
00:31:55.581 --> 00:31:57.999
So can a calculator.

440
00:31:58.166 --> 00:32:03.754
Well, I think she might be happier
in an older and more advanced class.

441
00:32:04.506 --> 00:32:07.133
I knew it!
You can't handle the little viper...

442
00:32:07.301 --> 00:32:09.927
...so you're trying to foist her off
on one of the other teachers.

443
00:32:10.095 --> 00:32:11.846
- No, no, no, Miss Trunchbull.
- Yes!

444
00:32:12.014 --> 00:32:14.682
Typical, slothful cowardice.

445
00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:17.184
Listen to me, Jen.

446
00:32:17.352 --> 00:32:21.981
The distance the shot put goes depends
upon the effort you put into it.

447
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:23.649
Perspiration!

448
00:32:23.817 --> 00:32:28.154
If you can't handle the little brat,
I'll lock her in the choky!

449
00:32:30.741 --> 00:32:32.950
- Get it?
- Yes, ma'am.

450
00:32:33.118 --> 00:32:37.705
One day, Jen, you'll see that everything
I do is for your own good...

451
00:32:37.873 --> 00:32:42.209
...and the good of those
putrescent little children!

452
00:33:03.857 --> 00:33:06.233
Get back at Tiffany. Before.

453
00:33:06.401 --> 00:33:08.402
- When she was having that...
- Mom, I'm home.

454
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:11.614
- How was school?
- School was great.

455
00:33:11.782 --> 00:33:14.408
My teacher lets me do
sixth-grade work. Look.

456
00:33:14.576 --> 00:33:16.911
- Algebra and geography.
- Hold on a minute.

457
00:33:17.079 --> 00:33:19.789
Can't you see I'm in the middle
of an important phone call?

458
00:33:20.123 --> 00:33:22.375
Well, you just asked me
how school was.

459
00:33:22.542 --> 00:33:24.001
Quiet.

460
00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:26.587
What else was she supposed
to do? The baby wasn't his.

461
00:33:26.755 --> 00:33:29.090
Well, it was really great.

462
00:33:29.257 --> 00:33:31.801
No way. They gotta be implants.

463
00:33:31.968 --> 00:33:36.806
The principal is insane. She threw
a girl over the fence by her hair.

464
00:33:36.973 --> 00:33:40.851
It would change your life too
if you waxed yours, I'm positive.

465
00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:44.021
I have the most wonderful teacher.

466
00:33:44.272 --> 00:33:46.107
Mine are driving me crazy.

467
00:33:46.274 --> 00:33:49.610
I'm telling you, six hours a day
at school is not enough.

468
00:33:49.778 --> 00:33:51.195
I'll say.

469
00:33:51.738 --> 00:33:54.907
Whack to the belly! A smack to
the face. Another smack to the face!

470
00:33:55.075 --> 00:33:57.910
Burns is hurt. He's on the ropes,
ladies and gentlemen.

471
00:33:58.203 --> 00:34:00.162
Saved by the bell.

472
00:34:00.539 --> 00:34:02.832
- Packages at this hour?
- Come here.

473
00:34:02.999 --> 00:34:05.543
- What?
- Okay.

474
00:34:09.089 --> 00:34:10.131
Hello.

475
00:34:10.298 --> 00:34:14.218
We don't give money. We don't like
charities. We don't buy raffle tickets.

476
00:34:14.386 --> 00:34:16.303
Mr. Wormwood.

477
00:34:16.471 --> 00:34:18.639
I'm Jennifer Honey.
I'm Matilda's teacher.

478
00:34:18.807 --> 00:34:20.433
What has she done now?

479
00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:24.979
You! Go to your room right now!
Right now. Beat it!

480
00:34:25.439 --> 00:34:28.733
Look, whatever it is,
she's your problem now.

481
00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.818
No, there is no problem.

482
00:34:31.153 --> 00:34:33.404
Then beat it. We're watching TV.

483
00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:38.743
Mr. Wormwood, if you think
watching some rotten TV show...

484
00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:42.538
...is more important than your daughter,
then maybe you shouldn't be a parent.

485
00:34:42.706 --> 00:34:46.041
Now, why don't you turn
that darn thing off and listen to me?

486
00:34:50.213 --> 00:34:52.298
All right, come in.
Get this over with.

487
00:34:52.466 --> 00:34:55.676
Mrs. Wormwood's not gonna
like this. Come on, get in.

488
00:34:58.638 --> 00:34:59.680
Close the door.

489
00:34:59.848 --> 00:35:01.849
- Who is it?
- Some teacher.

490
00:35:02.017 --> 00:35:04.852
Says she's gotta talk
to you about Matilda.

491
00:35:06.021 --> 00:35:09.315
What did you do that for?
He had Velasquez on the ropes.

492
00:35:09.733 --> 00:35:10.775
What do you want?

493
00:35:10.942 --> 00:35:14.403
I'm sure you're aware by now
that Matilda has a brilliant mind.

494
00:35:14.571 --> 00:35:16.447
Yeah, right. Mikey, get me a beer.

495
00:35:16.615 --> 00:35:19.241
Her math skills are simply extraordinary.

496
00:35:19.409 --> 00:35:21.494
- She's reading material that I...
- Want one?

497
00:35:21.661 --> 00:35:24.038
Oh, no, thank you, dear.

498
00:35:24.206 --> 00:35:28.501
Material that I didn't see
until my second year of college.

499
00:35:28.668 --> 00:35:30.711
- Oh, college.
- Great, college.

500
00:35:30.879 --> 00:35:33.047
I really feel, with private instruction...

501
00:35:33.215 --> 00:35:36.050
...that she'd be ready for college
in just a few short years.

502
00:35:36.218 --> 00:35:38.719
Look, Miss Snit.

503
00:35:38.887 --> 00:35:42.264
A girl does not get anywhere
by acting intelligent.

504
00:35:42.432 --> 00:35:44.391
I mean, take a look
at you and me.

505
00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:47.937
You chose books. I chose looks.

506
00:35:48.104 --> 00:35:51.732
I have a nice house,
a wonderful husband...

507
00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:56.779
...and you are slaving away teaching
snot-nosed children their ABC's.

508
00:35:56.947 --> 00:36:00.074
You want Matilda to go to college?

509
00:36:00.867 --> 00:36:05.079
College! I didn't go to college.
I don't know anybody who did.

510
00:36:05.247 --> 00:36:08.791
Bunch of hippies
and cesspool salesmen.

511
00:36:08.959 --> 00:36:12.127
Don't sneer at educated people,
Mr. Wormwood.

512
00:36:12.295 --> 00:36:14.672
If you became ill, heaven forbid...

513
00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:18.008
...your doctor would be
a college graduate.

514
00:36:18.218 --> 00:36:21.136
Or say you were sued
for selling a faulty car.

515
00:36:21.304 --> 00:36:23.597
The lawyer who defended you
would've gone to college too.

516
00:36:23.765 --> 00:36:27.101
What car? Sued by who?

517
00:36:27.269 --> 00:36:30.396
- Who you been talking to?
- Nobody.

518
00:36:33.191 --> 00:36:38.904
Oh, dear, I can see
we're not going to agree, are we?

519
00:36:39.489 --> 00:36:42.741
No. I'm sorry I burst in
on you like this.

520
00:36:42.909 --> 00:36:44.618
Sorry.

521
00:36:46.037 --> 00:36:48.455
We ought to sue her
for interrupting our show.

522
00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.875
Tell me about it.

523
00:36:51.293 --> 00:36:53.085
Why's he in the middle of the ring?

524
00:36:53.253 --> 00:36:55.421
He's standing in the middle
of the ring because it's over.

525
00:36:55.589 --> 00:36:56.881
Thank you.

526
00:36:57.048 --> 00:36:58.716
- We missed it?
- Tomorrow.

527
00:36:58.884 --> 00:37:02.553
- Great, it's over.
- Who won?

528
00:37:02.721 --> 00:37:04.346
How do I know?
You shut it off!

529
00:37:04.514 --> 00:37:06.849
Was it my fault that she came
in the middle of the fight?

530
00:37:07.017 --> 00:37:08.559
Hop to. Hippity-hop.

531
00:37:08.727 --> 00:37:13.314
The entire school will go
to the assembly room immediately.

532
00:37:13.481 --> 00:37:15.107
Sit!

533
00:37:16.151 --> 00:37:18.903
- What's up?
- Beats me.

534
00:37:22.198 --> 00:37:24.491
Bruce Bogtrotter.

535
00:37:33.335 --> 00:37:36.712
Would little Brucey
come up here, please?

536
00:37:49.059 --> 00:37:51.685
He lives on my block.

537
00:37:56.358 --> 00:38:00.444
This boy, Bruce Bogtrotter...

538
00:38:00.612 --> 00:38:04.531
...is none other
than a vicious sneak thief.

539
00:38:04.699 --> 00:38:07.034
You're a disgusting criminal,
aren't you?

540
00:38:07.202 --> 00:38:09.620
I don't know what you're talking about.

541
00:38:09.788 --> 00:38:12.706
Cake. Chocolate cake.

542
00:38:13.083 --> 00:38:16.335
You slithered like a serpent
into the school kitchen...

543
00:38:16.503 --> 00:38:18.879
...and ate my personal snack!

544
00:38:19.506 --> 00:38:21.799
Do you deny it?

545
00:38:26.388 --> 00:38:29.223
Confess!

546
00:38:29.724 --> 00:38:32.977
Well, it's hard for me
to remember a specific cake.

547
00:38:33.728 --> 00:38:35.646
This one...

548
00:38:35.814 --> 00:38:37.231
...was mine.

549
00:38:37.399 --> 00:38:41.235
And it was the most scrumptious
cake in the entire world.

550
00:38:41.403 --> 00:38:42.528
My mom's is better.

551
00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:46.532
It is, is it?

552
00:38:46.741 --> 00:38:50.035
How can you be sure
unless you have another piece?

553
00:38:51.579 --> 00:38:54.540
Sit down, Bog.

554
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.518
Here we go.

555
00:39:14.936 --> 00:39:18.147
Smells chocolaty, eh?

556
00:39:19.441 --> 00:39:22.276
Now, eat it!

557
00:39:24.904 --> 00:39:27.614
I don't want any, thank you.

558
00:39:28.366 --> 00:39:29.408
Eat it!

559
00:39:32.287 --> 00:39:34.079
Don't eat it.

560
00:39:34.873 --> 00:39:36.290
She wouldn't give him cake.

561
00:39:36.458 --> 00:39:38.625
- It's poison.
- Something's up.

562
00:39:47.886 --> 00:39:49.344
Yeah.

563
00:40:09.574 --> 00:40:12.576
You look like you enjoyed that,
Brucey.

564
00:40:13.161 --> 00:40:14.661
Yes, ma'am.

565
00:40:14.996 --> 00:40:17.331
You must have some more.

566
00:40:18.124 --> 00:40:19.917
Oh, no, thanks.

567
00:40:20.085 --> 00:40:22.419
But you'll hurt Cook's feelings.

568
00:40:22.962 --> 00:40:24.880
Cookie.

569
00:40:27.801 --> 00:40:32.679
She made this cake just for you
to have on your very own.

570
00:40:35.266 --> 00:40:39.019
Her sweat and blood
went into this cake...

571
00:40:39.187 --> 00:40:41.146
...and you will not leave
this platform...

572
00:40:41.314 --> 00:40:45.359
...until you have consumed
the entire confection!

573
00:40:45.527 --> 00:40:47.694
Entire confection.

574
00:40:48.071 --> 00:40:50.364
- See you at lunch.
- Thank you, Cookie.

575
00:40:50.532 --> 00:40:54.284
- Rotten kids.
- You wanted cake, you got cake.

576
00:40:54.452 --> 00:40:56.870
Now, eat it!

577
00:41:10.593 --> 00:41:12.719
Poor Brucey.

578
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:47.713
He's going to puke.

579
00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:51.341
I can't look. Is he going to puke?

580
00:41:51.509 --> 00:41:53.427
Without a doubt.

581
00:42:01.102 --> 00:42:02.769
Bruce looks real bad.

582
00:42:02.937 --> 00:42:04.605
Give up?

583
00:42:09.611 --> 00:42:12.029
You can do it, Brucey!

584
00:42:12.447 --> 00:42:14.698
You can do it, Bruce!

585
00:42:15.533 --> 00:42:16.909
Yeah, you can do it!

586
00:42:18.286 --> 00:42:20.621
Go, Bruce!

587
00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.956
Bruce! Bruce! Bruce! Bruce! Bruce!

588
00:42:27.587 --> 00:42:28.629
Silence!

589
00:42:32.133 --> 00:42:33.717
Yes!

590
00:42:33.968 --> 00:42:36.094
Yeah!

591
00:42:37.764 --> 00:42:38.805
Silence!

592
00:42:42.894 --> 00:42:45.479
Stop! Silence!

593
00:43:08.836 --> 00:43:11.421
Shut up! The entire assembly...

594
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:15.467
...will stay five hours after school
and copy from the dictionary.

595
00:43:15.969 --> 00:43:19.638
Any children who object
will go straight into the choky...

596
00:43:19.806 --> 00:43:21.682
...together!

597
00:43:27.188 --> 00:43:30.816
Rescue 8 out of Station 8,
Los Angeles County.

598
00:43:30.984 --> 00:43:35.070
This was a Code R, an official way
of saying we've caught a bad one.

599
00:43:35.238 --> 00:43:38.699
The kind of accident where death
itself holds a stopwatch on us.

600
00:43:41.244 --> 00:43:44.454
- Young lady, where were you?
- Miss Trunchbull kept the school late...

601
00:43:44.622 --> 00:43:46.498
...because a boy ate
some chocolate cake.

602
00:43:46.666 --> 00:43:49.543
That's the biggest lie I ever heard.
You see those packages over there?

603
00:43:49.711 --> 00:43:52.963
They were left out for the world to see
because you weren't here to take them in.

604
00:43:53.131 --> 00:43:55.340
- I don't think it's fair, bumpkins.
- What?

605
00:43:55.508 --> 00:43:58.677
You get all this stuff from catalogs,
and I don't get anything.

606
00:43:58.845 --> 00:44:02.431
It's not catalogs, it's car parts,
sweetness. It's business.

607
00:44:02.598 --> 00:44:05.559
Oh, if it's business, why don't you
have it sent to the office?

608
00:44:05.727 --> 00:44:07.728
Because the cops
may be watching the office.

609
00:44:07.895 --> 00:44:10.147
The cops are watching the house.

610
00:44:10.315 --> 00:44:13.400
- What?
- They're parked outside right now.

611
00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:15.902
You are such an ignoramus.

612
00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:20.073
Those are speedboat salesmen.
Really nice guys.

613
00:44:20.241 --> 00:44:21.908
Cops.

614
00:44:24.078 --> 00:44:27.497
Speedboats?
There are no lakes around here.

615
00:44:27.665 --> 00:44:31.126
Yeah, but some people like
to go away on the weekends.

616
00:44:31.294 --> 00:44:34.463
- Some people have fun.
- And some people are cops.

617
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:36.590
- They are not cops.
- Are too.

618
00:44:36.758 --> 00:44:39.259
They are not. I ought to know
if there's cops watching my house.

619
00:44:39.427 --> 00:44:42.429
Now, go to bed,
you lying little earwig.

620
00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:45.807
With the FBI watching her father...

621
00:44:45.975 --> 00:44:48.393
...and the Trunchbull
terrorising her school...

622
00:44:48.561 --> 00:44:52.356
...it was a rare, happy moment when
Matilda could just play with her friends.

623
00:44:52.523 --> 00:44:55.859
A frog! A frog! A frog!

624
00:44:56.736 --> 00:45:00.197
- What is it, Lavender?
- A frog!

625
00:45:02.158 --> 00:45:03.367
It's a salamander.

626
00:45:03.534 --> 00:45:05.452
- It's a chameleon.
- It's a newt.

627
00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:10.082
"Any of the small semiaquatic
salamanders from the genus Triturus."

628
00:45:10.249 --> 00:45:14.878
"Some are brightly colored
and secrete irritating substances."

629
00:45:18.299 --> 00:45:20.592
How could you keep going?

630
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:24.304
Useless, flaming car!

631
00:45:25.139 --> 00:45:26.556
Wormwood!

632
00:45:26.808 --> 00:45:28.392
Sell me a lemon?

633
00:45:28.559 --> 00:45:30.560
You're heading for
the choky, young lady!

634
00:45:30.728 --> 00:45:31.812
- Choky?
- Teach you a lesson.

635
00:45:31.979 --> 00:45:33.105
What lesson?

636
00:45:33.272 --> 00:45:35.565
You and your father think
you can make a fool out of me!

637
00:45:35.733 --> 00:45:38.276
- My father?
- The guy with that stupid haircut!

638
00:45:38.611 --> 00:45:42.614
- I'm nothing like my father.
- You're the spitting image.

639
00:45:42.824 --> 00:45:45.867
The apple never rots
far from the tree.

640
00:45:46.994 --> 00:45:48.078
Miss Honey!

641
00:45:48.246 --> 00:45:50.372
Miss Trunchbull teaches
our class today, Lavender.

642
00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:52.040
- Please get a water pitcher.
- But Miss Honey...

643
00:45:52.583 --> 00:45:55.335
Quickly. She'll be here any second.
Come on.

644
00:45:56.379 --> 00:46:00.173
Make sure the water's cold, Lavender.
Hurry. Vinnie, cover the fish.

645
00:46:00.842 --> 00:46:03.885
Put away the art projects.
Put away anything colorful.

646
00:46:04.053 --> 00:46:05.637
Oh, Charlie, won't you get
those crayons for me.

647
00:46:05.805 --> 00:46:09.474
Most great ideas come from
hard work and careful planning.

648
00:46:09.642 --> 00:46:13.353
Of course, once in a while,
they just jump out at you.

649
00:46:13.521 --> 00:46:16.148
Raina, cover the birds
and beetles. Hurry! Hurry!

650
00:46:16.315 --> 00:46:21.236
I hear her coming. Okay, now, last
time, some of you forgot yourselves.

651
00:46:21.404 --> 00:46:25.198
Don't speak unless you're spoken to.
Don't laugh. Don't smile.

652
00:46:25.366 --> 00:46:27.492
Don't even breathe loudly.

653
00:46:27.743 --> 00:46:30.203
Don't breathe at all.

654
00:46:32.457 --> 00:46:34.040
Morning, Miss Trunchbull.

655
00:46:34.208 --> 00:46:36.418
Good morning, Miss Trunchbull.

656
00:46:38.045 --> 00:46:39.171
Sit!

657
00:46:48.014 --> 00:46:52.517
I have never been able to understand
why small children are so disgusting.

658
00:46:52.685 --> 00:46:54.895
They're the bane of my life.

659
00:46:55.062 --> 00:46:57.481
- They're like insects.
- Where's Matilda?

660
00:46:57.648 --> 00:47:00.984
They should be got rid of
as early as possible.

661
00:47:03.404 --> 00:47:05.572
My idea of a perfect school...

662
00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:10.619
...is one in which there
are no children at all.

663
00:47:11.746 --> 00:47:14.206
Do you agree, Miss Honey?

664
00:47:18.127 --> 00:47:22.756
Now, you, front of the class!

665
00:47:28.763 --> 00:47:30.931
Are you okay?

666
00:47:31.933 --> 00:47:36.019
Next time I tell you to empty your
pockets, you'll do it faster, won't you?

667
00:47:36.187 --> 00:47:38.605
- Yes, Miss Trunchbull.
- Miss Honey.

668
00:47:39.148 --> 00:47:43.109
This could be the most interesting thing
you've ever done.

669
00:47:46.447 --> 00:47:49.032
Sit down,
you squirming worm of vomit!

670
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:51.576
Thank you, Miss Trunchbull.

671
00:48:01.087 --> 00:48:02.796
Get up!

672
00:48:05.299 --> 00:48:06.341
Can you spell?

673
00:48:06.592 --> 00:48:09.678
Miss Honey taught us how
to spell a long word yesterday.

674
00:48:09.845 --> 00:48:11.596
We can spell "difficulty."

675
00:48:11.764 --> 00:48:15.475
You couldn't spell "difficulty"
if your life depended on it.

676
00:48:15.935 --> 00:48:17.686
She taught us with a poem.

677
00:48:17.853 --> 00:48:19.521
A poem, how sweet.

678
00:48:19.689 --> 00:48:25.110
- What poem would that be?
- Mrs. D, Mrs. I

679
00:48:25.278 --> 00:48:27.737
Mrs. F-F-I

680
00:48:27.905 --> 00:48:32.409
Mrs. C, Mrs. U
Mrs. L-T-Y

681
00:48:33.327 --> 00:48:35.495
Why are all these women married?

682
00:48:35.663 --> 00:48:40.000
Mrs. D? Mrs. I? You're supposed
to be teaching spelling, not poetry!

683
00:48:45.506 --> 00:48:47.465
I cannot, for the life of me,
understand...

684
00:48:47.633 --> 00:48:50.385
...why small children take
so long to grow up.

685
00:48:50.553 --> 00:48:53.305
I think they do it deliberately
just to annoy me.

686
00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:11.948
What's funny?

687
00:49:12.199 --> 00:49:14.951
Come on, spit it out. Speak up.

688
00:49:15.119 --> 00:49:18.038
I like a joke as well
as the next fat person.

689
00:49:24.295 --> 00:49:26.963
It's a snake. It's a snake!

690
00:49:27.965 --> 00:49:29.841
It's a snake!

691
00:49:31.844 --> 00:49:35.263
One of you tried to poison me. Who?

692
00:49:36.557 --> 00:49:38.558
Matilda.

693
00:49:38.726 --> 00:49:39.768
I knew it!

694
00:49:40.019 --> 00:49:43.730
I just thought you'd like to know,
it's not a snake. It's a newt.

695
00:49:43.898 --> 00:49:46.858
- What did you say?
- It's a newt.

696
00:49:47.026 --> 00:49:52.238
Stand up, you villainous sack
of goat slime! You did this.

697
00:49:52.406 --> 00:49:53.531
No, Miss Trunchbull.

698
00:49:53.699 --> 00:49:58.203
Did you act alone,
or did you have accomplices?

699
00:49:58.371 --> 00:49:59.996
I didn't do it.

700
00:50:00.164 --> 00:50:02.582
You didn't like the choky, did you?

701
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:04.834
Thought you'd
pay me back, didn't you?

702
00:50:05.002 --> 00:50:08.129
Well, I'll pay you back, young lady.

703
00:50:08.297 --> 00:50:11.341
- For what, Miss Trunchbull?
- For this newt, you piss-worm!

704
00:50:11.509 --> 00:50:14.427
I'm telling you, I didn't do it!

705
00:50:15.096 --> 00:50:17.514
Besides, even if you didn't
do it, I'm gonna punish you...

706
00:50:17.682 --> 00:50:21.434
...because I'm big and you're small,
and I'm right and you're wrong.

707
00:50:21.602 --> 00:50:24.187
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

708
00:50:24.355 --> 00:50:28.274
You're a liar and a scoundrel,
and your father's a liar and a cheat.

709
00:50:28.442 --> 00:50:32.946
You're the most corrupt lowlifes
in the history of civilization.

710
00:50:33.114 --> 00:50:35.615
Am I wrong? I'm never wrong.

711
00:50:36.242 --> 00:50:42.122
In this classroom,
in this school, I am God!

712
00:51:13.779 --> 00:51:15.488
- You!
- I didn't move.

713
00:51:16.157 --> 00:51:17.699
You did this!

714
00:51:17.867 --> 00:51:21.995
How could she possibly have done it
when she was sitting way over here?

715
00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:26.541
I'll be watching you,
each and every one.

716
00:51:26.709 --> 00:51:28.376
When you turn the corner...

717
00:51:28.544 --> 00:51:31.671
...when you go to your cubbies
to get your smelly coats...

718
00:51:31.839 --> 00:51:33.840
...when you skip merrily to lunch...

719
00:51:34.008 --> 00:51:36.843
...I'll be watching you, all of you...

720
00:51:37.011 --> 00:51:39.554
...and especially you.

721
00:51:48.814 --> 00:51:50.648
Oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry.

722
00:51:51.192 --> 00:51:54.861
- Thanks for not telling.
- Best friends don't tell.

723
00:51:56.614 --> 00:51:58.948
She can really dance.

724
00:52:00.534 --> 00:52:04.204
I'm gonna clean up this mess, then I'll
come and help you fill the bird feeder.

725
00:52:04.371 --> 00:52:06.372
I'll be out there in a minute.

726
00:52:08.751 --> 00:52:11.503
- Miss Honey?
- Yes, Matilda?

727
00:52:13.214 --> 00:52:15.965
Miss Honey, I did it.

728
00:52:16.509 --> 00:52:19.052
- Did what?
- I made the glass tip over.

729
00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:23.223
Oh, sweetheart, don't let Miss
Trunchbull make you feel that way.

730
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:25.058
Nobody did it. It was an accident.

731
00:52:25.226 --> 00:52:29.229
I did it with my eyes.
Watch, I'll prove it to you.

732
00:52:32.733 --> 00:52:35.026
It's wonderful you feel so powerful.

733
00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:39.072
Many people don't feel
powerful at all.

734
00:52:48.415 --> 00:52:52.919
Come on, tip over, you glass.
Glass, tip over. Tip over.

735
00:52:53.087 --> 00:52:55.588
Come on, tip over.
Tip over, glass.

736
00:52:55.756 --> 00:52:57.423
It's all right, Matilda.

737
00:53:01.095 --> 00:53:04.347
I really did do it, Miss Honey.

738
00:53:04.515 --> 00:53:08.601
One of the odd things about life
is sometimes you can do something...

739
00:53:08.769 --> 00:53:11.855
...until you wanna show someone,
and then you can't.

740
00:53:12.022 --> 00:53:14.941
Or sometimes you think something's
broken and then you take it to be fixed...

741
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:16.734
This isn't like that.

742
00:53:19.363 --> 00:53:21.406
I don't know.

743
00:53:22.283 --> 00:53:24.951
Maybe I made myself tired.

744
00:53:26.161 --> 00:53:29.205
Matilda, would you like to come over
to my house this afternoon?

745
00:53:30.124 --> 00:53:32.458
I'd like that very much, Miss Honey.

746
00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:34.544
Good.

747
00:53:36.797 --> 00:53:39.799
I just stare very hard,
and then my eyes get all hot...

748
00:53:39.967 --> 00:53:42.302
...and I can feel the strongness.

749
00:53:42.469 --> 00:53:46.472
I feel like I can move
almost anything in the world.

750
00:53:47.182 --> 00:53:49.350
You do believe me, don't you?

751
00:53:49.518 --> 00:53:51.644
Oh, I believe that you should believe
in whatever power...

752
00:53:51.812 --> 00:53:56.649
...you think you have inside of you.
Believe it with all your heart.

753
00:53:59.528 --> 00:54:02.488
That's where Miss Trunchbull lives.

754
00:54:04.533 --> 00:54:06.326
Why is there a swing?

755
00:54:07.661 --> 00:54:13.166
A girl I know used to live in that house.
Her life was good and happy.

756
00:54:13.334 --> 00:54:17.295
When she was just 2 years old,
her mother died.

757
00:54:17.463 --> 00:54:19.213
Her father was a doctor...

758
00:54:19.381 --> 00:54:22.175
...and he needed someone
to look after things at home...

759
00:54:22.343 --> 00:54:25.720
...so he invited the mother's stepsister
to come and live with him.

760
00:54:25.888 --> 00:54:30.266
But the girl's aunt was a mean person
who treated the girl very badly.

761
00:54:30.434 --> 00:54:33.603
- The Trunchbull.
- Yes.

762
00:54:33.771 --> 00:54:37.857
And worst of all,
when the girl was 5, her father died.

763
00:54:38.025 --> 00:54:39.484
How did her father die?

764
00:54:39.652 --> 00:54:42.487
The police decided he'd killed himself.

765
00:54:42.655 --> 00:54:44.405
Why would he do such a thing?

766
00:54:44.573 --> 00:54:46.532
No one knows.

767
00:54:50.913 --> 00:54:52.705
The end is happier.

768
00:54:52.873 --> 00:54:54.540
She found a small cottage.

769
00:54:54.708 --> 00:54:58.544
She rented it from this lovely
rhubarb farmer for just $50 a month...

770
00:54:58.712 --> 00:55:02.382
...and she covered it in honeysuckle, and
she planted hundreds of wildflowers...

771
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:05.718
...and she moved out of her wicked aunt's
house and she finally got her freedom.

772
00:55:05.886 --> 00:55:07.971
Good for her.

773
00:55:08.138 --> 00:55:11.224
- Do you know why I told you this?
- No.

774
00:55:13.894 --> 00:55:17.230
You were born into a family
that doesn't always appreciate you...

775
00:55:17.773 --> 00:55:21.234
...but one day,
things are gonna be very different.

776
00:55:25.739 --> 00:55:28.700
Should we go inside
and have tea and cookies?

777
00:55:28.867 --> 00:55:30.618
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

778
00:55:35.290 --> 00:55:38.918
- This is the cottage from your story.
- Yes.

779
00:55:39.837 --> 00:55:42.380
The young woman is you.

780
00:55:43.799 --> 00:55:45.800
But then...

781
00:55:46.301 --> 00:55:49.470
- No.
- Yes.

782
00:55:49.638 --> 00:55:51.931
Aunt Trunchbull.

783
00:55:55.853 --> 00:55:58.312
When I left my home,
Aunt Trunchbull's home...

784
00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:00.606
...I had to leave
all my treasures behind.

785
00:56:01.191 --> 00:56:05.611
- Treasures?
- Photographs of my mother and father...

786
00:56:05.821 --> 00:56:10.074
...and a beautiful doll my mother
gave me with a china face.

787
00:56:10.242 --> 00:56:12.285
Lissy Doll, I called her.

788
00:56:12.453 --> 00:56:15.038
- Would you like some milk?
- Yes, please.

789
00:56:16.582 --> 00:56:19.167
Why don't you run away?

790
00:56:20.377 --> 00:56:24.505
I've often thought about it,
but I can't abandon my children.

791
00:56:24.673 --> 00:56:27.842
And if I couldn't teach,
I'd have nothing at all.

792
00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:30.803
You're very brave, Miss Honey.

793
00:56:31.805 --> 00:56:33.723
Not as brave as you.

794
00:56:33.891 --> 00:56:36.642
I thought grownups
weren't afraid of anything.

795
00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:38.144
Quite the contrary.

796
00:56:38.645 --> 00:56:41.773
All grownups get scared,
just like children.

797
00:56:42.649 --> 00:56:46.152
I wonder what
Miss Trunchbull is afraid of.

798
00:56:53.368 --> 00:56:55.661
There she is.

799
00:57:02.044 --> 00:57:03.920
Shot put.

800
00:57:04.088 --> 00:57:05.296
Hammer throw.

801
00:57:05.464 --> 00:57:07.548
Javelin.

802
00:57:18.852 --> 00:57:20.228
Back, back, back, back!

803
00:57:20.604 --> 00:57:22.355
She's afraid of a cat?

804
00:57:22.523 --> 00:57:24.774
Black cats.
She's very superstitious.

805
00:57:24.983 --> 00:57:29.529
Go!

806
00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:36.035
Poor kitty.

807
00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:39.372
- Oh, he's all right.
- Hopefully.

808
00:57:46.255 --> 00:57:49.132
- Let's go get your treasures.
- No, Matilda.

809
00:57:49.299 --> 00:57:52.927
Well, she's gone. Come on.

810
00:57:55.556 --> 00:57:59.100
- Matilda!
- Miss Honey.

811
00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:09.235
Come on, move,
you piece of junkyard fodder.

812
00:58:09.403 --> 00:58:11.571
Shift, you... No, no.

813
00:58:19.955 --> 00:58:22.498
My house.

814
00:58:30.966 --> 00:58:33.342
Oh, my.

815
00:58:36.096 --> 00:58:38.806
My father's portrait
used to hang there.

816
00:58:38.974 --> 00:58:42.518
Whoever painted the Trunchbull
must have had a strong stomach.

817
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:45.271
A really strong stomach.

818
00:59:07.502 --> 00:59:08.878
We should go.

819
00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:12.590
Father's chocolate box.

820
00:59:16.678 --> 00:59:20.932
After supper, he'd take
a chocolate, cut it in half...

821
00:59:21.099 --> 00:59:23.517
...and he'd always
give me the bigger half.

822
00:59:24.311 --> 00:59:27.730
When he died, Trunchbull would count
them so I couldn't even sneak one.

823
00:59:27.898 --> 00:59:32.485
She'd take a chocolate,
bring it to her lips and say:

824
00:59:32.653 --> 00:59:35.238
Much too good for children.

825
00:59:40.202 --> 00:59:42.328
Have one.

826
00:59:45.916 --> 00:59:49.418
No, she'd notice.

827
00:59:49.586 --> 00:59:53.005
- Where's Lissy Doll?
- Upstairs.

828
00:59:54.716 --> 00:59:56.676
Matilda.

829
00:59:59.346 --> 01:00:00.429
What?

830
01:00:02.182 --> 01:00:03.349
Matilda.

831
01:00:09.690 --> 01:00:12.733
You filthy... Crush the little weasel!

832
01:00:13.527 --> 01:00:16.112
This is my room.

833
01:00:21.535 --> 01:00:23.119
That's my dad.

834
01:00:23.287 --> 01:00:25.955
- What's his name?
- Magnus.

835
01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:30.209
I used to call him King Magnus
and he called me Bumblebee.

836
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:34.588
I don't think Magnus killed himself.

837
01:00:34.756 --> 01:00:36.215
Neither do I.

838
01:00:38.385 --> 01:00:39.885
Is that Lissy Doll?

839
01:00:43.515 --> 01:00:47.435
Wormwood, you useless,
used-car-salesman scum!

840
01:00:47.602 --> 01:00:51.605
I want you around here now
with another car!

841
01:00:52.441 --> 01:00:56.402
Yes, I know what caveat emptor
means, you lowlife liar!

842
01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:58.988
I'm gonna sue you. I'm gonna
burn down your showroom!

843
01:00:59.156 --> 01:01:02.533
I'm gonna take that no-good jalopy you
sold me and shove it up your bazooga!

844
01:01:02.701 --> 01:01:06.037
When I'm finished with you,
you're gonna look like roadkill!

845
01:01:06.204 --> 01:01:08.039
You what?

846
01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.189
Come on.

847
01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:40.863
- Shouldn't we hide or something?
- Yeah. Yeah, go.

848
01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:44.241
Go to the end of the hall, down the stairs
and out the kitchen door.

849
01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:46.369
I'll distract her.

850
01:01:55.003 --> 01:01:58.422
Who's in my house?!

851
01:02:03.345 --> 01:02:05.221
Come out and fight like a man!

852
01:03:01.361 --> 01:03:03.279
Tallyho!

853
01:05:06.486 --> 01:05:08.529
Come on, come on.

854
01:05:26.673 --> 01:05:28.340
Come on, over there.

855
01:05:29.134 --> 01:05:32.845
Some rats are gonna die today.

856
01:06:11.593 --> 01:06:14.136
Oh, my goodness.

857
01:06:15.221 --> 01:06:17.014
Feel my heart.

858
01:06:17.182 --> 01:06:21.060
Weren't you the most scared
you've ever been in your whole life?

859
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:25.606
Come on, let's go.

860
01:06:25.774 --> 01:06:29.234
She shouldn't be allowed
to treat people like that.

861
01:06:29.402 --> 01:06:32.237
- Somebody's gotta teach her a lesson.
- I know.

862
01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:35.908
We'll wait until she leaves again,
then we'll go get your doll.

863
01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:38.327
- What?
- Just kidding.

864
01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:43.290
Come here.

865
01:06:44.668 --> 01:06:49.046
Matilda, promise me you will never
go back in that house again.

866
01:06:49.756 --> 01:06:51.465
I promise.

867
01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:54.468
Okay. Come on.

868
01:07:03.728 --> 01:07:07.314
So he came home with $2000 cash...

869
01:07:07.482 --> 01:07:09.441
...and he threw it up in the air...

870
01:07:09.609 --> 01:07:14.947
...and we both just swam in it like
we were on The Million Dollar Sticky.

871
01:07:15.407 --> 01:07:17.783
Do you like that show?

872
01:07:17.951 --> 01:07:19.910
I love that show.

873
01:07:20.078 --> 01:07:21.537
That was the old days.

874
01:07:21.705 --> 01:07:25.582
Now he's got money in banks all over
this planet, and does he give me a dime?

875
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:29.962
- Matilda, this is Bob and Bill.
- They're cops.

876
01:07:30.463 --> 01:07:33.716
They are not cops.
They are Ace Powerboat salesmen.

877
01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:35.342
Babyface, I'm starved!

878
01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:39.179
Hi, Harry.

879
01:07:39.347 --> 01:07:40.973
Who are you?

880
01:07:41.141 --> 01:07:44.226
What is this, a hot tub party?
Get the hell out of here!

881
01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:45.894
I slave all day, I come home...

882
01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:48.814
...you're entertaining a couple
of surfer-dude bodybuilders.

883
01:07:49.149 --> 01:07:50.566
They're cops, Dad.

884
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:53.569
- You interested in time-share?
- Get out of here.

885
01:07:54.237 --> 01:07:57.656
You don't let me talk to people.
I am in a cage, Harry.

886
01:07:57.824 --> 01:08:01.368
I need to talk to somebody
besides our stupid kids.

887
01:08:01.536 --> 01:08:05.247
Oh, yeah? A man is entitled to come
home and find dinner on the table...

888
01:08:05.582 --> 01:08:08.333
...without having to wade
through male strippers!

889
01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:10.377
- Dad?
- What do you want?

890
01:08:10.879 --> 01:08:14.548
- Yell at me, okay?
- Shut up and leave us alone!

891
01:08:15.383 --> 01:08:17.843
- Yell at me again.
- Yell at you?

892
01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:20.345
I'll come in and pound
your miserable hide!

893
01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:22.931
What do I have to do
to gain respect around here?!

894
01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:25.768
I'm gonna give you a tanning
like you've never had in your life!

895
01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:29.521
My word is my law!
You understand?! Law!

896
01:08:34.778 --> 01:08:36.570
No kid likes being yelled at...

897
01:08:36.738 --> 01:08:39.573
...but it was precisely
Harry's ranting and raving...

898
01:08:39.741 --> 01:08:42.034
...that gave Matilda
the key to her power.

899
01:08:42.202 --> 01:08:46.622
To unlock that power,
all she had to do was practice.

900
01:08:56.883 --> 01:08:59.218
You're a little cheat.
What, are you stupid?

901
01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:02.513
I'm smart, you're dumb.
The apple never rots far from the tree.

902
01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:04.306
I think there is something
wrong with that girl.

903
01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:06.809
- I'm right, you're wrong.
- Hey, dip-face, here's your book.

904
01:09:06.976 --> 01:09:11.063
You're a Wormwood.
It's time you started acting like one!

905
01:10:21.759 --> 01:10:23.302
That was my personal favorite...

906
01:10:23.469 --> 01:10:25.929
...played especially for all you
little bitty pretty ones...

907
01:10:26.097 --> 01:10:27.806
...moving and grooving
on this sunny afternoon.

908
01:10:27.974 --> 01:10:31.226
Playing music to make you smile,
so you'd better not touch that d...

909
01:10:43.489 --> 01:10:45.282
Shouldn't we have a search warrant
to do this?

910
01:10:45.450 --> 01:10:47.826
No, this guy's dirty.

911
01:10:47.994 --> 01:10:51.872
Once we show this tape in court,
Wormwood's goose is cooked.

912
01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:55.584
I'm sure that box
is full of stolen car parts.

913
01:10:55.835 --> 01:10:57.669
You've been taping all week.

914
01:10:57.837 --> 01:11:00.672
How about letting me handle
that camera for a while?

915
01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:02.591
You know how to use it?

916
01:11:02.759 --> 01:11:05.344
You know about the zoom
and the white balance?

917
01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:09.473
- You know how to adjust the eyepiece?
- I can handle it.

918
01:11:12.727 --> 01:11:15.187
Besides, it's my turn.

919
01:11:15.355 --> 01:11:17.940
Yeah, your turn to drop it.

920
01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:20.859
I won't drop it.

921
01:11:21.027 --> 01:11:22.736
Come on.

922
01:11:23.154 --> 01:11:27.199
You two men are gonna be
in a lot of trouble very soon.

923
01:11:27.367 --> 01:11:30.035
It's the female minor.

924
01:11:31.329 --> 01:11:33.163
Aren't you supposed to be
in school, young lady?

925
01:11:33.331 --> 01:11:35.374
I really hope you have
a search warrant.

926
01:11:35.541 --> 01:11:38.835
According to a constitutional
law book I read in the library...

927
01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:43.382
...if you don't have one, you could lose
your job or even go to federal prison.

928
01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.717
It's your father who's
going to federal prison.

929
01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:49.054
- And you know where you'll end up?
- In a federal orphanage.

930
01:11:49.222 --> 01:11:51.640
If you cooperate, we'll make sure
it's a nice orphanage.

931
01:11:52.016 --> 01:11:56.061
The kind with food and
teeny-weeny cockroaches.

932
01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:57.270
What do you say?

933
01:11:58.731 --> 01:12:03.485
There's another crime in the making.
Your car's about to run a stop sign.

934
01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:18.250
So she bought a little time
for her dad to come to his senses.

935
01:12:18.418 --> 01:12:21.420
But now Matilda had
bigger fish to fry...

936
01:12:21.587 --> 01:12:23.630
...much bigger.

937
01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:41.940
Hey, dip-face, where are you going?

938
01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:44.151
Out.

939
01:12:46.446 --> 01:12:49.948
Hey, dip-face, have a carrot.

940
01:13:03.296 --> 01:13:06.131
Chew your food. You're an animal.

941
01:13:11.471 --> 01:13:13.472
Having power
isn't nearly as important...

942
01:13:13.639 --> 01:13:15.557
...as what you choose to do with it.

943
01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:19.895
And what Matilda had in mind
was nothing short of heroic.

944
01:14:44.147 --> 01:14:46.982
Come here. Come on.
Lissy Doll, come on.

945
01:14:47.150 --> 01:14:50.152
Come, Lissy. Come on, doll.
Please. Come on.

946
01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:52.445
Come on, Lissy. Please come here.

947
01:15:08.296 --> 01:15:09.796
Yes!

948
01:16:53.192 --> 01:16:55.527
Leave me alone!

949
01:17:29.353 --> 01:17:31.396
Magnus!

950
01:18:30.623 --> 01:18:35.085
Miss Honey! Miss Honey,
you'll never believe what I got you.

951
01:18:36.295 --> 01:18:38.630
Oh, Matilda.

952
01:18:39.382 --> 01:18:42.300
- Matilda.
- Oh, I also brought you this.

953
01:18:42.468 --> 01:18:44.302
I ate mine last night.

954
01:18:58.901 --> 01:19:02.195
I will be teaching your class today.

955
01:19:08.494 --> 01:19:11.871
In the time it took Miss Honey
to get very, very nervous...

956
01:19:12.039 --> 01:19:15.083
...Matilda had formulated a plan.

957
01:19:15.543 --> 01:19:18.002
She is really raving mad.

958
01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:21.589
What is it your father used to call you?
Hummingbird?

959
01:19:21.757 --> 01:19:25.260
Bumblebee. I'm sure
she knows the doll's missing.

960
01:19:25.428 --> 01:19:27.303
And he called her Trunchbull?

961
01:19:27.471 --> 01:19:31.099
No, I suppose he called her Agatha.
Yes, that's...

962
01:19:31.267 --> 01:19:35.478
- She called him Magnus, right?
- Yeah. Yes.

963
01:19:35.646 --> 01:19:37.355
Maybe I could go back to the house...

964
01:19:37.523 --> 01:19:39.941
...and put the doll back
while she's still at school.

965
01:19:40.109 --> 01:19:43.528
- No, I can't do that.
- Calm down, Miss Honey. Really.

966
01:19:43.696 --> 01:19:45.613
It's gonna be okay, I promise.

967
01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:49.200
Sweetheart, you promised you
wouldn't go back in that house again.

968
01:19:49.368 --> 01:19:53.621
I didn't. I was on the garage roof.
I did it with my powers.

969
01:19:53.956 --> 01:19:56.499
Okay, on the garage roof
with your powers.

970
01:19:56.667 --> 01:20:00.044
All right, I need to think. Let's see.

971
01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:20.440
Powers.

972
01:20:27.114 --> 01:20:30.742
I think I've got them down.
Watch this.

973
01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:51.429
No more Miss Nice Girl.

974
01:20:53.599 --> 01:20:56.601
Get inside. Inside! Quickly, run!

975
01:20:56.769 --> 01:20:59.771
Run! Get against the wall!
Against that wall. Quickly!

976
01:20:59.939 --> 01:21:01.731
Don't make me wait.

977
01:21:01.899 --> 01:21:03.983
Water!

978
01:21:04.944 --> 01:21:07.362
And hold the newt.

979
01:21:11.283 --> 01:21:13.785
Join the ranks. Move!

980
01:21:16.956 --> 01:21:21.125
I am here to teach you all a lesson.

981
01:21:24.797 --> 01:21:30.218
Sometimes in life, horrible
and unexplainable things happen.

982
01:21:33.847 --> 01:21:38.184
These things are a test of character.

983
01:21:42.481 --> 01:21:44.691
And I have character.

984
01:21:44.858 --> 01:21:49.404
Form a line across the room! Quickly!
Run, run, run! Don't keep me waiting.

985
01:21:49.822 --> 01:21:51.322
Fill this gap!

986
01:21:52.575 --> 01:21:56.995
I expect you're wondering
what I'm talking about.

987
01:21:57.496 --> 01:21:59.581
Yes.

988
01:21:59.748 --> 01:22:03.084
A child came to my house.

989
01:22:03.252 --> 01:22:07.005
I don't know how, I don't know when,
I don't know why.

990
01:22:07.172 --> 01:22:09.841
- Miss Trunchbull, may I...?
- No, you may not.

991
01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:13.970
But I know a child came.

992
01:22:14.138 --> 01:22:17.849
So did you know it was illegal...

993
01:22:18.017 --> 01:22:21.686
...to enter someone's home
without their permission?

994
01:22:21.854 --> 01:22:25.690
- Yes, Miss Trunchbull.
- Sir.

995
01:22:25.858 --> 01:22:28.067
Stand straight!
Stomachs in! Shoulders back!

996
01:22:29.695 --> 01:22:32.196
Do any of you recognize...

997
01:22:33.198 --> 01:22:34.866
...this?

998
01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:39.412
Let's play a game. Shall we?

999
01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:45.043
Who was wearing a pretty
red hair ribbon yesterday...

1000
01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:48.046
...and isn't wearing one today?

1001
01:22:48.213 --> 01:22:51.299
Can you answer me that?

1002
01:22:51.467 --> 01:22:56.721
Who does this disgusting ribbon
belong to?

1003
01:22:58.015 --> 01:22:59.891
I shall personally see to it...

1004
01:23:00.059 --> 01:23:03.561
...that the demented, drooling,
slime-breathed little Lilliputian...

1005
01:23:03.729 --> 01:23:06.397
...who owns this disgusting ribbon...

1006
01:23:06.565 --> 01:23:11.027
...will never see the light
of day again. You.

1007
01:23:11.195 --> 01:23:14.822
Miss Trunchbull, I was the one who was
at your house last night. I know what...

1008
01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:18.743
I broke your arm once before,
I can do it again, Jenny.

1009
01:23:18.911 --> 01:23:21.829
I am not 7 years old anymore,
Aunt Trunchbull.

1010
01:23:24.249 --> 01:23:26.584
Shut your holes!

1011
01:23:26.752 --> 01:23:29.420
You will be put away in a place...

1012
01:23:29.588 --> 01:23:34.342
...where not even the crows
can land their droppings on you.

1013
01:23:34.593 --> 01:23:35.760
Look.

1014
01:23:36.929 --> 01:23:39.514
- The chalk.
- The chalk.

1015
01:23:39.682 --> 01:23:42.016
- Chalk.
- The blinds.

1016
01:23:46.605 --> 01:23:49.941
- "A."
- "Agatha...

1017
01:23:52.611 --> 01:23:55.154
...this is Magnus.

1018
01:23:57.449 --> 01:23:59.492
Give my...

1019
01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:01.786
...little Bumblebee...

1020
01:24:01.954 --> 01:24:04.997
...her house...

1021
01:24:05.165 --> 01:24:06.958
...and her money."

1022
01:24:07.126 --> 01:24:10.461
- Money?
- "Then get out of town.

1023
01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:13.881
If you don't, I will get you.

1024
01:24:14.049 --> 01:24:18.094
I will get you like you got me.

1025
01:24:18.262 --> 01:24:20.346
That is a promise."

1026
01:25:39.218 --> 01:25:41.969
No, no, Miss Trunchbull,
please don't throw him.

1027
01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:50.454
- Lavender!
- Lavender!

1028
01:26:55.377 --> 01:26:58.212
- Neat!
- That's cool.

1029
01:27:07.931 --> 01:27:10.141
It's the Trunch.

1030
01:27:14.021 --> 01:27:15.771
Hey, you guys, look at this.

1031
01:27:15.939 --> 01:27:17.565
Yes!

1032
01:27:20.527 --> 01:27:22.320
Let go.

1033
01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:29.785
Cool. I didn't know I could do that.

1034
01:27:29.953 --> 01:27:31.996
Pretty good, huh?

1035
01:27:47.179 --> 01:27:49.347
Yeah!

1036
01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:23.214
And the Trunchbull was gone,
never to be seen or heard from...

1037
01:28:23.382 --> 01:28:26.175
...never to darken a doorway again.

1038
01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:30.888
Miss Honey moved back
into her father's house.

1039
01:28:31.056 --> 01:28:32.390
Teatime.

1040
01:28:32.557 --> 01:28:34.350
Of course, Matilda
was a frequent visitor.

1041
01:28:34.518 --> 01:28:38.938
Did you know that the heart of a mouse
beats at the rate of 650 times a minute?

1042
01:28:39.231 --> 01:28:42.274
- My, where'd you learn that?
- In a book.

1043
01:28:42.442 --> 01:28:46.070
It beats so fast, it doesn't sound like
beating. It sounds like it's humming.

1044
01:28:46.279 --> 01:28:49.407
A porcupine's heart beats
300 times a minute.

1045
01:28:49.992 --> 01:28:51.993
- All right.
- Quick!

1046
01:28:52.494 --> 01:28:53.786
Hey, you.

1047
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:57.832
Hey, we're leaving. Let's go.
Get in the car. Hurry up.

1048
01:28:58.291 --> 01:29:01.002
Let's wrap up these cookies.
Come on, we're leaving. Now.

1049
01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:02.837
I'd be happy to walk her home.

1050
01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:05.840
Well, nobody will be there.
We're moving to Guam.

1051
01:29:06.008 --> 01:29:07.508
- Come on, let's go.
- Guam?

1052
01:29:07.676 --> 01:29:09.719
Daddy's not gonna be in
the auto business anymore.

1053
01:29:09.928 --> 01:29:12.179
I don't want to leave.

1054
01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:14.306
But we're going
on a permanent vacation.

1055
01:29:14.683 --> 01:29:17.268
Yeah, and we gotta beat the
speedboat salesmen to the airport.

1056
01:29:17.436 --> 01:29:21.022
I love it here.
I love my school. It isn't fair.

1057
01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:22.523
Miss Honey, please
don't let them take me.

1058
01:29:22.691 --> 01:29:24.108
- Get in the car, Melinda.
- Matilda.

1059
01:29:24.276 --> 01:29:26.402
- Whatever.
- I want to stay with Miss Honey.

1060
01:29:26.570 --> 01:29:28.362
Well, Miss Honey doesn't want you.

1061
01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:30.614
Why would she want some
snotty, disobedient kid?

1062
01:29:30.782 --> 01:29:34.452
Because she's a spectacularly
wonderful child, and I love her.

1063
01:29:34.911 --> 01:29:38.330
Adopt me, Miss Honey.
You can adopt me.

1064
01:29:38.498 --> 01:29:40.624
Look, I don't have time
for all these legalities.

1065
01:29:40.792 --> 01:29:43.127
One second, Dad,
I have the adoption papers.

1066
01:29:43.295 --> 01:29:44.712
What?

1067
01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:47.381
Hey, where'd you get those?
From a book in the library.

1068
01:29:47.549 --> 01:29:49.717
I've had them since
I was big enough to Xerox.

1069
01:29:49.968 --> 01:29:52.094
Are you hearing this, Harry?

1070
01:29:53.555 --> 01:29:56.724
- All you have to do is sign them.
- I'll be an only child again.

1071
01:29:56.892 --> 01:30:00.853
Shut up!
I can't think with all these sirens.

1072
01:30:02.606 --> 01:30:04.815
What do you think, pumpkin?

1073
01:30:07.319 --> 01:30:10.321
You're the only daughter
I ever had, Matilda.

1074
01:30:10.489 --> 01:30:14.241
And I never understood you,
not one little bit.

1075
01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:19.330
Who's got a pen?

1076
01:30:20.999 --> 01:30:24.001
- Here.
- Thanks.

1077
01:30:25.837 --> 01:30:29.715
And doing, perhaps, the first decent
thing they ever did for their daughter...

1078
01:30:29.883 --> 01:30:33.469
...the Wormwoods signed
the adoption papers.

1079
01:30:33.845 --> 01:30:36.764
- And here.
- Okay.

1080
01:30:39.559 --> 01:30:42.645
All right, come on. Here.
Turn around.

1081
01:30:45.774 --> 01:30:48.526
You're not gonna be calling us for
support payments or something like that?

1082
01:30:48.693 --> 01:30:51.821
Oh, no, no. We'll have everything
we need. Don't worry.

1083
01:30:51.988 --> 01:30:54.031
All right, here. Let's roll.

1084
01:30:59.704 --> 01:31:00.746
Ciao.

1085
01:31:09.631 --> 01:31:12.007
So Harry and Zinnia got away.

1086
01:31:12.175 --> 01:31:16.637
And as bad as things were before,
that's how good they became.

1087
01:31:19.891 --> 01:31:23.018
Miss Honey was made principal
of Crunchem Hall...

1088
01:31:23.186 --> 01:31:26.939
...which had to add an upper school
because children never wanted to leave.

1089
01:31:27.107 --> 01:31:30.276
And Matilda found,
to her great surprise...

1090
01:31:30.443 --> 01:31:32.194
...that life could be fun.

1091
01:31:32.362 --> 01:31:36.323
And she decided to have
as much of it as possible.

1092
01:31:36.491 --> 01:31:40.286
After all, she was a very smart kid.

1093
01:31:54.759 --> 01:31:56.760
But the happiest part of the story...

1094
01:31:56.928 --> 01:31:59.138
...is that Matilda and Miss Honey...

1095
01:31:59.306 --> 01:32:02.141
...each got what they had
always wanted:

1096
01:32:02.309 --> 01:32:04.977
A loving family.

1097
01:32:06.521 --> 01:32:10.482
And Matilda never had
to use her powers again.

1098
01:32:10.859 --> 01:32:13.777
Well, I mean, almost never.

1099
01:32:23.830 --> 01:32:26.457
"Call me Ishmael.

1100
01:32:26.625 --> 01:32:29.627
Some years ago,
never mind how long precisely...

1101
01:32:29.794 --> 01:32:33.255
...having little or no money
in my purse and nothing particular to..."
