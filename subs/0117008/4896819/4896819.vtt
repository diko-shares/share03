1
00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:46.092
<i>Everyone is born,</i>

2
00:00:46.255 --> 00:00:48.599
<i>but not everyone
is born the same.</i>

3
00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:52.978
<i>Some will grow to be butchers
or bakers or candlestick makers.</i>

4
00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:56.811
<i>Some will only be really good
at making Jell-O salad.</i>

5
00:00:56.974 --> 00:01:01.024
<i>One way or another, though,
every human being is unique,</i>

6
00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:03.530
<i>for better or for worse.</i>

7
00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:09.369
<i>Most parents believe their children are the most
beautiful creatures ever to grace the planet.</i>

8
00:01:09.695 --> 00:01:11.572
<i>Others take
a less emotional approach.</i>

9
00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:13.661
- What a waste of time.
- And painful.

10
00:01:13.824 --> 00:01:16.543
And expensive.
$9.25 for a bar of soap?

11
00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:19.797
Well, I had to take a shower, Harry.
$5000?

12
00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:23.004
I'm not paying it. What are they
gonna do, repossess the kid?

13
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.193
There's no way out.
Make a U-turn.

14
00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:42.398
All right.

15
00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:50.486
- Harry!
- All right.

16
00:01:51.486 --> 00:01:53.033
Harry!

17
00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:54.581
The Wormwood guy's back!

18
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.413
<i>Harry and Zinnia Wormwood</i>

19
00:01:56.575 --> 00:01:59.499
<i>lived in a very nice neighborhood,
in a very nice house.</i>

20
00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:02.460
<i>But they were not really
very nice people.</i>

21
00:02:12.758 --> 00:02:15.261
Get out of the street, you little dodos!

22
00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:25.028
<i>The Wormwoods were so
wrapped up in their own silly lives</i>

23
00:02:25.187 --> 00:02:27.440
<i>that they barely noticed
they had a daughter.</i>

24
00:02:27.606 --> 00:02:29.825
<i>Had they paid any attention
to her at all,</i>

25
00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:33.328
<i>they'd have realized
she was a rather extraordinary child.</i>

26
00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:36.115
Oh, my gosh, Matilda,
now look what you did!

27
00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:38.409
<i>They named her Matilda.</i>

28
00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:41.920
You're supposed
to eat the spinach. Ooh!

29
00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:46.713
Ew, ew, ew.
Ew, ew, ew!

30
00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:52.593
Babies!

31
00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:55.635
You're better off raising tomatoes.

32
00:02:56.218 --> 00:02:57.891
<i>By the time she was 2,</i>

33
00:02:58.053 --> 00:03:01.398
<i>Matilda had learned what most
people learn in their early 30s:</i>

34
00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:03.729
<i>How to take care of herself.</i>

35
00:03:06.978 --> 00:03:11.279
<i>As time went by,
she developed a sense of style.</i>

36
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.903
<i>Every morning, Matilda's brother,
Michael, went to school.</i>

37
00:03:15.112 --> 00:03:16.284
Bye, Mom.
Get out of here.

38
00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:19.416
<i>Her father worked selling used cars
Make money.</i>

39
00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:22.669
<i>for unfair prices.
And her mother took off to play bingo.</i>

40
00:03:22.828 --> 00:03:25.923
Soup's on the stove.
Heat it up if you get hungry.

41
00:03:26.123 --> 00:03:28.296
<i>Matilda was left alone.</i>

42
00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:31.215
<i>That was how she liked it.</i>

43
00:03:36.717 --> 00:03:39.641
<i>♪ On my way, on my way ♪</i>

44
00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:44.061

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:48.358

<i>♪ I may see you ♪</i>

51
00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:11.377
<i>By the time she was 4, Matilda
had read every magazine in the house.</i>

52
00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:13.841
<i>One night,
she got up her courage</i>

53
00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:17.725
<i>and asked her father for something
she desperately wanted.</i>

54
00:04:17.883 --> 00:04:20.682
A book?
What do you want a book for?

55
00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:22.183
To read.

56
00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:25.599
To read? Why would you wanna read
when you got the television set

57
00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:27.860
sitting right in front of you?

58
00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:33.031
There's nothing you can get from a book that
you can't get from a television faster.

59
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.942
Get out of the way!

60
00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:39.030
<i>Matilda already knew that she
was somewhat different from her family.</i>

61
00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:42.786
<i>She saw that whatever
she needed in this world,</i>

62
00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.951
<i>she'd have to get herself.</i>

63
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.128
<i>Bye.
Ciao.</i>

64
00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:50.166
There's fish fingers
in the microwave.

65
00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:56.092
<i>The next morning,
after her parents left,</i>

66
00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:58.677
<i>Matilda set off
in search of a book.</i>

67
00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:40.215
Where are the
children's books, please?

68
00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:42.100
In that room right over there.

69
00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:45.388
Would you like me to pick you out
one with lots of pictures in it?

70
00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:49.350
No, thank you.
I'm sure I can manage.

71
00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:09.036
<i>From then on, every day,
as soon as her mother went to bingo,</i>

72
00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:12.922
<i>Matilda walked
the 10 blocks to the library</i>

73
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.919
<i>and devoured
one book after another.</i>

74
00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:23.433
<i>When she finished
all the children's books,</i>

75
00:06:23.592 --> 00:06:26.641
<i>she started wandering around
in search of something else.</i>

76
00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:29.727
<i>Mrs. Phelps, who had been
watching her with fascination</i>

77
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.358
<i>for the past few weeks,</i>

78
00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:34.520
<i>offered Matilda some valuable
library information.</i>

79
00:06:34.686 --> 00:06:37.530
You know, you could have
your very own library card.

80
00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:40.067
And then you could
take books home

81
00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:43.237
and you wouldn't have
to walk here every day.

82
00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:45.576
You could take
as many as you like.

83
00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:48.117
That would be wonderful.

84
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.255
<i>So Matilda's strong,
young mind continued to grow,</i>

85
00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:57.167
<i>nurtured by the voices
of all those authors</i>

86
00:06:57.334 --> 00:06:59.837
<i>who had sent their books
out into the world</i>

87
00:07:00.003 --> 00:07:02.973
<i>like ships onto the sea.</i>

88
00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:15.402
<i>These books gave Matilda
a hopeful and comforting message:</i>

89
00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:17.687
<i>You are not alone.</i>

90
00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:39.543
Any packages come today?

91
00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:41.128
Mm-mm.

92
00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:43.721
Where did
all this come from?

93
00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:45.887
The library.

94
00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:50.225
The library? You've never set foot in a library.
You're only 4 years old.

95
00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:51.764
Six and a half.

96
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.557
You're 4.
Six and a half.

97
00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:56.067
If you were 6 and a half,
you'd be in school already.

98
00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:58.069
I want to be in school.
I told you

99
00:07:58.228 --> 00:08:01.698
I was supposed to start school
in September. You wouldn't listen.

100
00:08:02.357 --> 00:08:04.576
Get up. Get UP!

101
00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:08.037
Get out here.
Give me that book.

102
00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:13.748
Dearest pie, how old is Matilda?
Four

103
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.834
I'm 6 and a half, Mommy.
Five, then.

104
00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:19.416
I was 6 in August.
You're a liar.

105
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:22.920
I wanna go to school.
School!

106
00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:26.340
Out of the question. Who would be
here to sign for the packages?

107
00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:29.601
We can't leave valuable packages
sitting out on the doorstep.

108
00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:32.437
Now, go watch TV
like a good kid.

109
00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:35.974
You know, sometimes I think there's
something wrong with that girl.

110
00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:38.690
Hm. Tell me about it.
Mm.

111
00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:40.695
Hey, dip-face,

112
00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:44.279
have a marshmallow.
Have another marshmallow, dip-face!

113
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.743
Dip-face!

114
00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:57.291
<i>Sometimes Matilda
longed for a friend.</i>

115
00:08:57.454 --> 00:09:01.084
<i>Someone like the kind,
courageous people in her books.</i>

116
00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:04.628
<i>It occurred to her that
like talking dragons and princesses</i>

117
00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:10.426
<i>with hair long enough to climb, such
people might exist only in storybooks.</i>

118
00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:14.354
<i>But Matilda was about to discover
that she could be her own friend.</i>

119
00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:17.391
<i>That she had a kind of strength
she wasn't even aware of.</i>

120
00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:20.526
I'm great! I'm incredible!

121
00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:23.154
Michael, pencil and paper,
in the kitchen.

122
00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:25.907
Did we sell some cars today,
honeydew?

123
00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:27.363
Did we!

124
00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:29.448
Does that mean
I can get that new TV?

125
00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:32.785
Yeah. Son, one day you're gonna
have to earn your own living.

126
00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:35.041
It's time you learned
the family business.

127
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.623
Sit down. Write this down.

128
00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:43.125
All right. The first car your
brilliant father sold cost $320.

129
00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:46.966
I sold it for $1158.

130
00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:49.677
The second one cost $512.
Mm-hm.

131
00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:55.016
I sold it for $2269.

132
00:09:55.178 --> 00:09:57.522
Wait, Dad, you're going too fast.
Just write.

133
00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:03.028
The third cost $68.
I sold it for $999.

134
00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:07.191
And the fourth cost $1100.

135
00:10:07.357 --> 00:10:13.285
I sold it for 7839
big American boffos.

136
00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:15.949
Harry!
What was my profit for the day?

137
00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:20.337
Could you repeat the last one--?
$10,265.

138
00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:25.383
Check it if you don't believe me.

139
00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:31.844
You're a little cheat.
You saw the paper.

140
00:10:32.006 --> 00:10:33.679
From all the way over here?

141
00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:37.141
Are you being smart with me?

142
00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:41.433
If you're being smart with me, young
lady, you're gonna be punished.

143
00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:43.897
Punished for being smart?

144
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.028
For being a smart aleck.

145
00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:49.991
When a person is bad, that person
has to be taught a lesson.

146
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.073
Person?
Get up!

147
00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:54.537
- Get up.
- Harry Wormwood

148
00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:56.949
<i>had unintentionally
given his daughter</i>

149
00:10:57.115 --> 00:10:59.868
<i>the first practical advice
she could use.</i>

150
00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:02.662
<i>He meant to say,
"When a child is bad."</i>

151
00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:05.457
<i>Instead he said,
"When a person is bad."</i>

152
00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:09.127
<i>And thereby introduced
a revolutionary idea</i>

153
00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:12.468
<i>that children could
punish their parents.</i>

154
00:11:14.299 --> 00:11:16.677
<i>Only when they deserved it,
of course.</i>

155
00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:38.467
Michael, come into my room.

156
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:42.637
What?

157
00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:46.684
My boy, today's the day I take you to the shop.
What do you say?

158
00:12:46.849 --> 00:12:49.068
I don't know.
What do you say, Dad?

159
00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:51.696
I say appearance
is nine-tenths of the law.

160
00:12:51.854 --> 00:12:53.902
People don't buy a car,
they buy me.

161
00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:57.035
Which is why I personally
take such pride in my appearance.

162
00:12:57.193 --> 00:13:00.663
Well-oiled hair,
clean shaved, snappy suit.

163
00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:03.951
Now, run along and get ready
for a big day of learning, kid. Heh.

164
00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:06.245
It's gonna be a big day
of learning too.

165
00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:09.881
There's a sucker born every minute.
We're gonna take them for all they got.

166
00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.216
Give me the cookies.

167
00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:14.172
Here.

168
00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:22.887
Okay, my boy, heir to the throne.

169
00:13:23.052 --> 00:13:25.726
Today we diddle the customer.

170
00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:28.896
What's wrong with you?
What are you looking at?

171
00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:31.690
Lovekins, where's my breakfast?

172
00:13:31.853 --> 00:13:35.153
Here we are, my heartstrings. Aah!

173
00:13:36.607 --> 00:13:39.577
Snickerdoodle, what did
you do to your hair?

174
00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:44.366
My hair?

175
00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:58.755
Give me those things. Give me that.
Where are you going with those?

176
00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:01.265
Give me those.
Get in the car. Go on.

177
00:14:04.761 --> 00:14:06.479
<i>- Get in.
- Dirty dealings,</i>

178
00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:11.351
<i>Like buying stolen car parts,
never stay secret for long.</i>

179
00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:14.612
<i>Especially when the FBI
gets involved.</i>

180
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:24.410
9:17, suspect exits domicile.

181
00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:26.449
I've got 9:18.

182
00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:30.294
9:17 is correct.

183
00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:44.635
Michael, one day
all this will be yours.

184
00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:46.511
This?

185
00:14:46.677 --> 00:14:49.806
See this junker?
I paid $100 for it.

186
00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:52.100
She's got 120,000 miles on her.

187
00:14:52.266 --> 00:14:55.190
Transmission shot,
bumpers have fallen off.

188
00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:57.276
What do I do with her? Hm?

189
00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:00.575
I sell her.

190
00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:03.202
We really should weld
these bumpers on,

191
00:15:03.361 --> 00:15:07.161
but that takes time,
equipment, money.

192
00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:10.827
So we use
Super Super Glue instead.

193
00:15:10.993 --> 00:15:13.371
Go ahead, put it on there.

194
00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:15.123
Won't it fall off?

195
00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:18.338
Definitely.
Isn't that dangerous?

196
00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:20.629
Not to me, okay?

197
00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:22.297
Transmission.

198
00:15:22.463 --> 00:15:26.684
The sawdust quiets the gears, and
lets the engine run as sweet as a nut

199
00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:29.346
for a couple of miles. Ha-ha-ha.
Daddy, that's cheating.

200
00:15:29.512 --> 00:15:33.016
Of course it's cheating.
Nobody ever got rich being honest.

201
00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:36.186
20 years ago, we could turn
the numbers back by hand. But--

202
00:15:36.352 --> 00:15:38.354
Here, take my hat.

203
00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:42.909
But the feds like to test the ingenuity
of the American businessman.

204
00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:44.656
Two-directional drill.

205
00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:47.288
You run it backwards,
the numbers go down.

206
00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:49.666
Watch the speedometer.

207
00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:52.372
Cool.

208
00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:55.626
See?
Yeah.

209
00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:57.836
Daddy, you're a crook.

210
00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:01.131
What?
This is illegal.

211
00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:03.341
Here, keep drilling.

212
00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:07.930
Do you make money?
Do you have a job?

213
00:16:08.092 --> 00:16:10.470
No, but don't people
need good cars?

214
00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:13.310
Can't you sell good cars, Dad?

215
00:16:14.056 --> 00:16:16.024
Listen, you little wiseacre.

216
00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:19.814
I'm smart, you're dumb. I'm big, you're little.
I'm right, you're wrong.

217
00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:22.232
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

218
00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:37.998
Harry, I won! I won!

219
00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:41.759
I hit the double bingo! Aah!

220
00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:45.343
Come on, everybody!
I'm taking you all to Café Le Ritz.

221
00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:47.382
Let me see the money.
Never mind.

222
00:16:47.548 --> 00:16:49.346
Double bingo, huh? Ooh.

223
00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:53.013
God, your hair looks awful.
I hope they let you in.

224
00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:55.181
- They'll let me in.
- Here's your hat, Daddy.

225
00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:57.225
Get in the car.

226
00:16:58.476 --> 00:16:59.944
Go on, get in.

227
00:17:02.146 --> 00:17:03.193
How much?

228
00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:05.279
It's for me to know
and you to find out.

229
00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:13.074
It's nice to go out sometimes.
Yeah.

230
00:17:13.241 --> 00:17:14.288
You never take us out.

231
00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:16.202
Of course I do.
I took you to the Flipper.

232
00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.713
- I don't remember any of the Flipper.
- The fish joint.

233
00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:20.965
You found that comb
in the bouillabaisse.

234
00:17:21.123 --> 00:17:23.125
Oh, yeah. I like that joint.

235
00:17:23.626 --> 00:17:25.594
Bonjour.
This way, please.

236
00:17:25.753 --> 00:17:27.255
Harry, take your hat off.

237
00:17:28.256 --> 00:17:29.849
I can't.
This is a nice place.

238
00:17:30.007 --> 00:17:31.850
You can't wear a hat inside.

239
00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:33.135
I can't take it off.

240
00:17:33.302 --> 00:17:36.146
Harry, nobody cares
what your hair looks like.

241
00:17:36.305 --> 00:17:39.525
What's with this hat?
I can't get it off. I can't get it off.

242
00:17:41.018 --> 00:17:44.272
Just a minute. I'm gonna yank
this hat off. I'm pulling it.

243
00:17:46.774 --> 00:17:49.118
I think your head
swelled up really bad.

244
00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.540
You're pulling the skin!
You're such a baby! Stop it!

245
00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:57.168
Fibers are fused to the head!
Fibers are fused?

246
00:17:57.326 --> 00:18:00.250
What is that supposed to mean?
Give me that hat!

247
00:18:29.692 --> 00:18:31.945
Mm.

248
00:18:33.487 --> 00:18:35.865
I will not be the figure of ridicule!

249
00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:38.251
I want respect, and I want it now!

250
00:18:40.202 --> 00:18:42.955
I still don't see how you
glued your hat on, Harry.

251
00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:45.716
I mean, I know you say you didn't,
but obviously you did.

252
00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:48.344
I did not glue my hat to my head.

253
00:18:48.502 --> 00:18:52.678
The hat shrunk,
the fibers fused to my hair. Ow.

254
00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:55.260
Baby, wait a minute.
I'm getting it now.

255
00:18:55.426 --> 00:18:57.224
I'm getting it. One more.

256
00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:01.352
Oh, my God.

257
00:19:10.691 --> 00:19:13.820
From now on, this family
does exactly what I say,

258
00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:16.409
when, exactly when, I say it!

259
00:19:16.572 --> 00:19:19.075
Here's your hat, Harry.
Give me that.

260
00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:21.168
And right now,

261
00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:24.714
we are eating dinner
and watching TV.

262
00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:30.587
<i>Are you ready to get
sticky with Mickey?</i>

263
00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:33.597
Shut your light off.

264
00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:36.768
<i>I'm just giving it away!</i>

265
00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:40.931
<i>But for those idiots out there who don't
know how to play, here's how it goes.</i>

266
00:19:41.097 --> 00:19:45.443
<i>For each correct answer, they'll move
one step closer to our cube of cash.</i>

267
00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:49.526
<i>Once in our cube of cash, any money
that sticks to your gooey body,</i>

268
00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:51.862
<i>you get to take home.</i>

269
00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:56.662
Hi, Dad.

270
00:19:56.821 --> 00:19:58.243
Are you in this family?

271
00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:01.292
Mm...

272
00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.293
Hello?

273
00:20:03.452 --> 00:20:06.046
Are you in this family?

274
00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:12.341
Dinnertime is family time.
What is this trash you're reading?

275
00:20:12.628 --> 00:20:14.801
It's not trash, Daddy, it's lovely.

276
00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:17.217
It's called <i>Moby Dick,</i>
by Herman Melville.

277
00:20:18.134 --> 00:20:19.556
Moby what?

278
00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:26.022
This is filth! Trash! Here.
It's not mine! It's a library book.

279
00:20:26.183 --> 00:20:27.730
Trash!

280
00:20:27.893 --> 00:20:32.114
I'm fed up with all this reading! You're
a Wormwood, you start acting like one!

281
00:20:32.273 --> 00:20:33.616
Sit up and look at the TV.

282
00:20:33.774 --> 00:20:37.495
<i>Producers are not liable for any skin
irritation that may result from playing our game.</i>

283
00:20:37.653 --> 00:20:39.781
<i>Get real sticky and get
cash for free.</i>

284
00:20:39.947 --> 00:20:43.247
<i>All right, that's enough.
Let's get sticky!</i>

285
00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:22.657
I didn't do it.

286
00:21:22.823 --> 00:21:25.667
Of course you didn't do it,
you little twit.

287
00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:28.333
I told you that was
a cheap set.

288
00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:32.217
It's not a cheap set,
it's a stolen set.

289
00:21:32.374 --> 00:21:34.092
Put your light on!

290
00:21:36.045 --> 00:21:37.092
Bummer.

291
00:21:37.254 --> 00:21:39.222
<i>Was it magic or coincidence?</i>

292
00:21:39.381 --> 00:21:40.883
<i>She didn't know.</i>

293
00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:44.771
<i>It is said that we humans use
only a tiny portion of our brains.</i>

294
00:21:44.929 --> 00:21:48.433
<i>Matilda might never have discovered
her own great strength of mind</i>

295
00:21:48.599 --> 00:21:52.274
<i>were it not for the events
that began on the very next day.</i>

296
00:21:52.436 --> 00:21:54.859
I need a car,
inexpensive but reliable.

297
00:21:55.022 --> 00:21:57.696
- Can you service me?
- In a manner of speaking, yes.

298
00:21:57.858 --> 00:21:59.280
Welcome to Wormwood Motors.

299
00:21:59.443 --> 00:22:01.696
Harry Wormwood,
owner, founder, whatever.

300
00:22:01.862 --> 00:22:05.787
Agatha Trunchbull, principal,
Crunchem Hall Elementary School.

301
00:22:06.242 --> 00:22:09.746
I warn you, sir, I want a tight
car, because I run a tight ship.

302
00:22:09.912 --> 00:22:13.837
Oh, yeah, huh? Well, uh--
My school is a model of discipline.

303
00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:17.094
“Use the rod, beat the child,"
that's my motto.

304
00:22:17.253 --> 00:22:19.597
Terrific motto.
You have brats yourself?

305
00:22:19.755 --> 00:22:22.178
Yeah, I got a boy, Mikey,
and one mistake, Matilda.

306
00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:26.471
They're all mistakes, children. Filthy,
nasty things. Glad I never was one.

307
00:22:26.637 --> 00:22:30.062
Uh-huh. Well, since you're an educator,
I'm gonna make you a great deal.

308
00:22:30.224 --> 00:22:32.852
You had better.
Let's do business.

309
00:22:34.687 --> 00:22:36.189
Thank you.

310
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.948
Enjoy it.

311
00:22:38.774 --> 00:22:41.197
Hey, you, you're going to school.
I am?

312
00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.203
First thing tomorrow.

313
00:22:43.654 --> 00:22:47.409
Yeah, yeah, okay, okay. You'll get
a real education at this place.

314
00:22:49.869 --> 00:22:54.045
<i>Matilda had always wanted to
go to school because she loved to learn.</i>

315
00:22:54.582 --> 00:22:57.836
<i>She tried to imagine
what her new school would be like.</i>

316
00:22:58.002 --> 00:22:59.086
Go ahead.

317
00:22:59.086 --> 00:22:59.094
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

318
00:22:59.094 --> 00:22:59.803
Go ahead.

319
00:23:00.087 --> 00:23:03.136
<i>She pictured a lovely
building surrounded by trees</i>

320
00:23:03.299 --> 00:23:05.677
<i>and flowers and swings.</i>

321
00:23:07.928 --> 00:23:09.930
<i>Well, there was a building</i>

322
00:23:10.139 --> 00:23:11.812
<i>and children.</i>

323
00:23:11.974 --> 00:23:14.602
<i>So regardless of what
Crunchem Hall looked like,</i>

324
00:23:14.768 --> 00:23:16.486
<i>she was happy to be there.</i>

325
00:23:16.645 --> 00:23:17.988
Hey, wait up!

326
00:23:18.439 --> 00:23:22.489
<i>After all, any school
is better than no school at all.</i>

327
00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.657
<i>Isn't it?</i>

328
00:23:58.896 --> 00:24:00.273
You, detention.

329
00:24:06.612 --> 00:24:08.706
You're too small.
Grow up quicker!

330
00:24:12.034 --> 00:24:13.911
Heads up! Shoulders back!
Stomachs in! Stand straight.

331
00:24:14.078 --> 00:24:15.295
Hey-
sorry-

332
00:24:15.454 --> 00:24:16.501
Detention for you.

333
00:24:16.664 --> 00:24:19.713
That's okay. It's much better
than being out there.

334
00:24:19.875 --> 00:24:21.172
Is that my teacher?

335
00:24:21.335 --> 00:24:23.758
No, that's the principal,
Miss Trunchbull.

336
00:24:23.921 --> 00:24:25.889
You've gotta be kidding.
Uh-uh.

337
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:28.684
You squirts better skedaddle.
I'm not kidding.

338
00:24:28.842 --> 00:24:31.721
The Trunchbull likes to snap a whip
in there to see who's trying to hide.

339
00:24:31.887 --> 00:24:33.434
Stomach in!

340
00:24:34.139 --> 00:24:35.766
Change those socks! Too pink.

341
00:24:35.933 --> 00:24:37.526
I'm Matilda.
Lavender.

342
00:24:38.143 --> 00:24:39.861
- I'm Hortensia.
- Hi.

343
00:24:40.145 --> 00:24:43.900
She doesn't really hit children
with that riding crop, does she?

344
00:24:44.066 --> 00:24:46.194
No, it's mostly for scare.

345
00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.078
What she does is worse.

346
00:24:48.237 --> 00:24:52.037
Like yesterday, in the second grade,
the Trunchbull makes a weekly visit

347
00:24:52.199 --> 00:24:56.500
to every classroom to show the teachers
a thing or two about handling kids.

348
00:24:56.662 --> 00:24:58.084
And Julius Rottwinkle ate

349
00:24:58.247 --> 00:25:01.126
<i>- two M&M's during her lesson.
- And she caught him?</i>

350
00:25:01.291 --> 00:25:02.918
<i>Of course.</i>

351
00:25:08.841 --> 00:25:12.141
Was Julius okay?
After being thrown out the window?

352
00:25:12.302 --> 00:25:15.727
Of course he wasn't okay.
He lived, if that's what you mean.

353
00:25:15.889 --> 00:25:18.733
The Trunchbull used
to be in the Olympics.

354
00:25:18.892 --> 00:25:22.112
Shot put, javelin, hammer throw.

355
00:25:22.271 --> 00:25:23.443
The hammer throw is her specialty.

356
00:25:23.605 --> 00:25:27.109
So she does this all the time?
Better than being put in the choky.

357
00:25:27.276 --> 00:25:30.029
- Choky?
- Yeah, the choky.

358
00:25:30.195 --> 00:25:33.039
It's a tall, narrow hole
in the wall behind a door.

359
00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:36.042
<i>You have to stand
in a drippy pipe with jagged edges.</i>

360
00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:38.750
<i>And the walls have broken glass
and nails sticking out.</i>

361
00:25:38.912 --> 00:25:41.791
Get inside, you
festering ball of pus!

362
00:25:41.957 --> 00:25:44.460
<i>- She puts kids in there?
- I've been in twice.</i>

363
00:25:44.626 --> 00:25:46.845
<i>Sometimes she leaves you
in there all day.</i>

364
00:25:47.004 --> 00:25:49.803
- Didn't you tell your parents?
- They didn't believe me.

365
00:25:50.007 --> 00:25:52.351
I mean, would your parents
believe it?

366
00:25:52.509 --> 00:25:55.308
“I must obey Miss Trunchbull."

367
00:25:55.888 --> 00:25:57.435
No.

368
00:25:57.598 --> 00:25:59.817
Out of my way.
Here she comes.

369
00:26:01.643 --> 00:26:05.819
Ahh, fresh meat.

370
00:26:12.488 --> 00:26:14.616
Amanda Thripp.

371
00:26:15.908 --> 00:26:17.330
Yes, Miss Trunchbull.

372
00:26:17.618 --> 00:26:20.337
What are those?
What's what, Miss Trunchbull?

373
00:26:20.579 --> 00:26:23.332
Hanging down by your ears.

374
00:26:23.499 --> 00:26:25.001
You mean my pigtails?

375
00:26:26.543 --> 00:26:30.343
Are you a pig, Amanda?
No, Miss Trunchbull.

376
00:26:30.798 --> 00:26:33.517
Do I allow pigs in my school?

377
00:26:33.675 --> 00:26:36.929
My mommy thinks they're sweet.

378
00:26:37.262 --> 00:26:39.856
Your mommy is a twit!

379
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:44.479
You'll chop those off
before school tomorrow or I will--

380
00:26:44.853 --> 00:26:46.230
But--
But?!

381
00:26:46.396 --> 00:26:49.115
I don't--
But? Did you say "but"?

382
00:26:49.691 --> 00:26:51.034
What? Hammer throw.

383
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.828
Definitely.

384
00:26:52.986 --> 00:26:55.034
I'll give you "but"!

385
00:27:04.957 --> 00:27:08.302
- Good loft!
- And excellent release.

386
00:27:12.339 --> 00:27:15.058
Think she'll make the fence?
Gonna be a close one.

387
00:27:36.446 --> 00:27:39.575
Quiet! Get to class
before I throw you all in the choky.

388
00:27:40.242 --> 00:27:41.960
Lavender.

389
00:27:42.119 --> 00:27:43.712
What's my teacher like?

390
00:27:44.163 --> 00:27:47.918
Run, run, run. Faster! Get in.

391
00:27:48.292 --> 00:27:49.589
Quickly!

392
00:27:49.751 --> 00:27:51.719
<i>But Matilda's teacher, Miss Honey,</i>

393
00:27:51.879 --> 00:27:53.881
<i>was one of those
remarkable people</i>

394
00:27:54.047 --> 00:27:57.927
<i>who appreciates every single child
for who she or he is.</i>

395
00:27:58.093 --> 00:28:00.095
I scooped these up for you,
Miss Honey.

396
00:28:00.262 --> 00:28:03.607
Oh, how lovely.
Thank you, Amanda.

397
00:28:03.891 --> 00:28:07.816
Okay, listen up, everybody.
We have a new student with us today.

398
00:28:07.978 --> 00:28:11.528
This is Matilda Wormwood. I'd like
you to sit over here with Lavender.

399
00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:14.489
Now, you all remember how scary
your first days at school were.

400
00:28:14.651 --> 00:28:19.157
So I'd like you to be especially nice to
Matilda and make her feel welcome, all right?

401
00:28:19.323 --> 00:28:20.745
Could you get her
workbook for her, please?

402
00:28:20.908 --> 00:28:23.661
Yes, Miss Honey.
You can sit down.

403
00:28:24.328 --> 00:28:27.798
<i>Miss Honey was a wonderful
teacher and a friend to everyone.</i>

404
00:28:27.956 --> 00:28:31.301
<i>But her life was not as simple
and beautiful as it seemed.</i>

405
00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:34.304
<i>Miss Honey had a deep,
dark secret.</i>

406
00:28:34.463 --> 00:28:36.306
<i>Though it caused her great pain,</i>

407
00:28:36.465 --> 00:28:39.560
<i>she did not let it interfere
with her teaching.</i>

408
00:28:40.427 --> 00:28:43.476
Well, Matilda, you've come
on a very good day,

409
00:28:43.639 --> 00:28:47.143
because we're going to review
everything that we've learned so far.

410
00:28:47.517 --> 00:28:50.487
Now, it's all right if you don't understand
any of this because you're brand-new.

411
00:28:50.646 --> 00:28:53.820
But if you do know an answer,
just raise your hand. Okay?

412
00:28:54.191 --> 00:28:57.161
All right. We've been working
on our two-times tables.

413
00:28:57.319 --> 00:28:59.413
Would anyone like
to demonstrate?

414
00:29:00.781 --> 00:29:02.078
Okay.

415
00:29:02.241 --> 00:29:04.335
Let's do some together.

416
00:29:06.828 --> 00:29:09.672
- Two times four is?
- Eight.

417
00:29:09.831 --> 00:29:13.131
- Two times six is?
- Twelve.

418
00:29:13.502 --> 00:29:15.800
- Two times nine is?
- Eighteen.

419
00:29:15.963 --> 00:29:18.182
Excellent! You've been practicing.

420
00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:20.684
Pretty soon you'll be able to do
any multiplication,

421
00:29:20.842 --> 00:29:23.436
- whether it's two times seven...
- Fourteen.

422
00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:27.190
Very good. Or 13 times 379.

423
00:29:27.349 --> 00:29:31.024
4927.

424
00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:34.356
I beg your pardon?

425
00:29:34.523 --> 00:29:36.867
I think that's the answer.

426
00:29:37.025 --> 00:29:40.370
13 times 379.

427
00:29:40.529 --> 00:29:42.031
4-9-2-7.

428
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:02.222
it is.

429
00:30:03.051 --> 00:30:04.724
Wow.

430
00:30:08.348 --> 00:30:11.067
Matilda, you know how
to multiply big numbers?

431
00:30:11.685 --> 00:30:15.690
I read this book last year
on mathematics at the library.

432
00:30:17.983 --> 00:30:19.656
You like to read?

433
00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:22.071
Oh, yes, I love to read.

434
00:30:22.362 --> 00:30:23.830
What do you like to read?

435
00:30:25.699 --> 00:30:29.829
Everything, but lately I've
been reading Darles Chickens.

436
00:30:31.079 --> 00:30:34.879
Charles Dickens.
I could read him every day.

437
00:30:36.251 --> 00:30:38.094
So could I.

438
00:30:41.131 --> 00:30:42.474
All right, everyone,

439
00:30:42.632 --> 00:30:46.136
take out your workbooks
and let's start with section three.

440
00:30:54.102 --> 00:30:55.775
I'll be back in a moment.

441
00:31:08.325 --> 00:31:13.297
Yippee! Gotcha right in the neck!
And you. Woo-hoo!

442
00:31:13.455 --> 00:31:16.299
Yes! You-- Come in, come in,
whoever you are.

443
00:31:20.128 --> 00:31:22.472
Almost got you.

444
00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:27.140
Good to see you, Jen.
Good, good, good.

445
00:31:27.302 --> 00:31:30.476
Time for one of our
little heart-to-hearts?

446
00:31:33.892 --> 00:31:37.362
Actually, it's about the new girl
in my class, Miss Trunchbull,

447
00:31:37.521 --> 00:31:39.148
Matilda Wormwood.

448
00:31:39.314 --> 00:31:42.158
Her father says she's a real wart.
A what?

449
00:31:42.317 --> 00:31:45.787
A carbuncle, a blister, a festering
pustule of malignant ooze.

450
00:31:45.946 --> 00:31:51.043
Oh, no, Matilda Wormwood
is a very sweet girl, and very bright.

451
00:31:51.201 --> 00:31:52.794
A bright child?

452
00:31:52.953 --> 00:31:55.251
Yes. She can multiply
large sums in her head.

453
00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:58.003
So can a calculator.

454
00:31:58.166 --> 00:32:03.764
Well, I think she might be happier
in an older and more advanced class.

455
00:32:03.922 --> 00:32:06.095
Ah, I knew it!

456
00:32:06.258 --> 00:32:09.933
You can't handle the little viper, so you're trying
to foist her off on one of the other teachers.

457
00:32:10.095 --> 00:32:11.847
No, no, no, Miss Trunchbull.
Yes!

458
00:32:12.013 --> 00:32:14.687
Typical, slothful cowardice.

459
00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:17.194
Listen to me, Jen.

460
00:32:17.352 --> 00:32:21.983
The distance the shot put goes depends
upon the effort you put into it.

461
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:23.651
Perspiration!

462
00:32:23.817 --> 00:32:28.163
If you can't handle the little brat,
I'll lock her in the choky!

463
00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.959
Get it?
Yes, ma'am.

464
00:32:33.118 --> 00:32:37.715
One day, Jen, you'll see that
everything I do is for your own good,

465
00:32:37.873 --> 00:32:42.219
and the good of those
putrescent little children!

466
00:33:03.857 --> 00:33:06.235
Get back at Tiffany. Before.

467
00:33:06.401 --> 00:33:08.403
When she was having that--
Mom, I'm home.

468
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:11.619
How was school?
School was great.

469
00:33:11.781 --> 00:33:14.409
My teacher lets me do
sixth-grade work. Look.

470
00:33:14.576 --> 00:33:16.920
Algebra and geography.
Hold on a minute.

471
00:33:17.078 --> 00:33:19.797
Can't you see I'm in the middle
of an important phone call?

472
00:33:20.123 --> 00:33:22.376
Well, you just asked me
how school was.

473
00:33:22.542 --> 00:33:24.010
Quiet.

474
00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:26.592
What else was she supposed
to do? The baby wasn't his.

475
00:33:26.755 --> 00:33:29.099
Well, it was really great.

476
00:33:29.257 --> 00:33:31.806
No way. They gotta be implants.

477
00:33:31.968 --> 00:33:36.815
The principal is insane. She threw
a girl over the fence by her hair.

478
00:33:36.973 --> 00:33:40.853
It would change your life too if
you waxed yours, I'm positive.

479
00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:44.023
I have the most
wonderful teacher.

480
00:33:44.272 --> 00:33:46.115
Mine are driving me crazy.

481
00:33:46.274 --> 00:33:49.619
I'm telling you, six hours a day
at school is not enough.

482
00:33:49.778 --> 00:33:51.200
I'll say.

483
00:33:51.363 --> 00:33:54.913
Hiyah. Whack to the belly! A smack to the face.
Another smack to the face!

484
00:33:55.075 --> 00:33:56.827
Burns is hurt. He's on the
ropes, ladies and gentlemen.

485
00:33:58.203 --> 00:34:00.171
Saved by the bell.

486
00:34:00.539 --> 00:34:02.837
Packages at this hour?
Come here.

487
00:34:02.999 --> 00:34:05.548
What?
Okay.

488
00:34:09.089 --> 00:34:10.136
Hello.

489
00:34:10.298 --> 00:34:14.223
We don't give money. We don't like charities.
We don't buy raffle tickets.

490
00:34:14.386 --> 00:34:16.309
Mr. Wormwood.

491
00:34:16.471 --> 00:34:18.644
I'm Jennifer Honey.
I'm Matilda's teacher.

492
00:34:18.807 --> 00:34:20.434
What has she done now?

493
00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:24.980
You! Go to your room
right now! Right now. Beat it!

494
00:34:25.438 --> 00:34:28.738
Look, whatever it is,
she's your problem now.

495
00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.823
No, there is no problem.

496
00:34:31.152 --> 00:34:33.405
Then beat it. We're watching TV.

497
00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:38.961
Mr. Wormwood, if you think
watching some rotten TV show

498
00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:42.464
is more important than your daughter,
then maybe you shouldn't be a parent.

499
00:34:42.622 --> 00:34:46.047
Now, why don't you turn that
darn thing off and listen to me?

500
00:34:50.213 --> 00:34:52.307
All right, come in.
Get this over with.

501
00:34:52.465 --> 00:34:55.685
Mrs. Wormwood's not gonna
like this. Come on, get in.

502
00:34:58.638 --> 00:34:59.685
Close the door.

503
00:34:59.848 --> 00:35:01.850
Who is it?
Some teacher.

504
00:35:02.017 --> 00:35:04.861
Says she's gotta talk
to you about Matilda.

505
00:35:06.021 --> 00:35:09.321
What did you do that for?
He had Velasquez on the ropes.

506
00:35:09.733 --> 00:35:10.780
What do you want?

507
00:35:10.942 --> 00:35:14.412
I'm sure you're aware by now that
Matilda has a brilliant mind.

508
00:35:14.571 --> 00:35:16.448
Yeah, right.
Mikey, get me a beer.

509
00:35:16.615 --> 00:35:19.243
Her math skills
are simply extraordinary.

510
00:35:19.409 --> 00:35:21.503
She's reading material that I--
Want one?

511
00:35:21.661 --> 00:35:24.039
Oh, no, thank you, dear.

512
00:35:24.205 --> 00:35:28.506
Material that I didn't see
until my second year of college.

513
00:35:28.668 --> 00:35:30.716
Oh, college.
Great, college.

514
00:35:30.879 --> 00:35:33.098
I really feel,
with private instruction

515
00:35:33.256 --> 00:35:36.055
that she'd be ready for college
in just a few short years.

516
00:35:36.217 --> 00:35:38.720
Look, Miss Snit.

517
00:35:38.887 --> 00:35:42.266
A girl does not get anywhere
by acting intelligent.

518
00:35:42.432 --> 00:35:44.400
I mean, take a look
at you and me.

519
00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:47.938
You chose books.
I chose looks.

520
00:35:48.104 --> 00:35:51.734
I have a nice house,
a wonderful husband,

521
00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:56.781
and you are slaving away teaching
snot-nosed children their ABC's.

522
00:35:56.946 --> 00:36:00.667
You want Matilda to go to college?
Ha-ha-ha.

523
00:36:00.867 --> 00:36:05.088
College! I didn't go to college.
I don't know anybody who did.

524
00:36:05.246 --> 00:36:08.796
Bunch of hippies and cesspool salesmen.
Ha-ha-ha.

525
00:36:08.958 --> 00:36:12.132
Don't sneer at educated people,
Mr. Wormwood.

526
00:36:12.295 --> 00:36:14.673
If you became ill,
heaven forbid,

527
00:36:14.839 --> 00:36:18.013
your doctor would be
a college graduate.

528
00:36:18.218 --> 00:36:21.142
Or say you were sued
for selling a faulty car.

529
00:36:21.304 --> 00:36:23.602
The lawyer who defended you
would've gone to college too.

530
00:36:23.765 --> 00:36:27.110
What car? Sued by who?

531
00:36:27.268 --> 00:36:30.397
Who you been talking to?
Nobody.

532
00:36:33.191 --> 00:36:38.914
Oh, dear, I can see
we're not going to agree, are we?

533
00:36:39.489 --> 00:36:42.743
No. I'm sorry I burst in
on you like this.

534
00:36:42.909 --> 00:36:44.627
Sorry.

535
00:36:46.037 --> 00:36:48.460
We ought to sue her
for interrupting our show.

536
00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.883
Tell me about it.

537
00:36:51.292 --> 00:36:53.090
Why's he in the middle of the ring?

538
00:36:53.253 --> 00:36:55.426
He's standing in the middle
of the ring because it's over.

539
00:36:55.588 --> 00:36:56.885
Thank you.

540
00:36:57.048 --> 00:36:58.721
We missed it?
Tomorrow.

541
00:36:58.883 --> 00:37:02.558
Great, it's over.
Who won?

542
00:37:02.721 --> 00:37:04.348
How do I know?
You shut it off!

543
00:37:04.514 --> 00:37:06.858
Was it my fault that she
came in the middle of the fight?

544
00:37:07.016 --> 00:37:08.563
<i>Hop to. Hippity-hop.</i>

545
00:37:08.727 --> 00:37:13.324
<i>The entire school will go
to the assembly room immediately.</i>

546
00:37:13.481 --> 00:37:15.108
Sit!

547
00:37:16.151 --> 00:37:18.904
What's up?
Beats me.

548
00:37:22.198 --> 00:37:24.496
Bruce Bogtrotter.

549
00:37:33.334 --> 00:37:36.713
Would little Brucey
come up here, please?

550
00:37:37.088 --> 00:37:39.432
Uh-Oh.

551
00:37:49.058 --> 00:37:51.686
He lives on my block.

552
00:37:56.357 --> 00:38:00.453
This boy,
Bruce Bogtrotter,

553
00:38:00.612 --> 00:38:04.537
is none other
than a vicious sneak thief.

554
00:38:04.699 --> 00:38:07.043
You're a disgusting
criminal, aren't you?

555
00:38:07.202 --> 00:38:09.625
I don't know what
you're talking about.

556
00:38:09.788 --> 00:38:12.712
Cake. Chocolate cake.

557
00:38:13.082 --> 00:38:16.336
You slithered like a serpent
into the school kitchen

558
00:38:16.503 --> 00:38:18.881
and ate my personal snack!

559
00:38:19.506 --> 00:38:21.804
Do you deny it?

560
00:38:26.387 --> 00:38:29.231
Confess!

561
00:38:29.724 --> 00:38:32.978
Well, it's hard for me
to remember a specific cake.

562
00:38:33.728 --> 00:38:35.651
This one

563
00:38:35.814 --> 00:38:37.236
was mine.

564
00:38:37.398 --> 00:38:41.244
And it was the most scrumptious
cake in the entire world.

565
00:38:41.402 --> 00:38:42.528
My mom's is better.

566
00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:46.533
It is, is it?

567
00:38:46.741 --> 00:38:50.041
How can you be sure
unless you have another piece?

568
00:38:51.579 --> 00:38:54.549
Sit down, Bog.

569
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.523
Here we go.

570
00:39:14.936 --> 00:39:18.156
Smells chocolaty, eh?

571
00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:22.284
Now, eat it!

572
00:39:24.904 --> 00:39:27.623
I don't want any, thank you.

573
00:39:28.366 --> 00:39:29.413
Eat it!

574
00:39:32.287 --> 00:39:34.085
Don't eat it.

575
00:39:34.873 --> 00:39:36.295
She wouldn't give him cake.

576
00:39:36.457 --> 00:39:38.630
It's poison.
Something's up.

577
00:39:45.216 --> 00:39:48.516
Mm. Mm-hm. Yeah.

578
00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:50.938
Mm.

579
00:39:59.439 --> 00:40:01.282
Mm.

580
00:40:09.574 --> 00:40:12.578
You look like you enjoyed that,
Brucey.

581
00:40:13.161 --> 00:40:14.663
Yes, ma'am.

582
00:40:14.996 --> 00:40:17.340
You must have some more.

583
00:40:18.124 --> 00:40:19.922
Oh, no, thanks.

584
00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:22.428
But you'll hurt Cook's feelings.

585
00:40:22.587 --> 00:40:24.681
Huh?
Cookie.

586
00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:32.681
She made this cake just for you
to have on your very own.

587
00:40:35.266 --> 00:40:39.021
Her sweat and blood
went into this cake

588
00:40:39.187 --> 00:40:45.365
and you will not leave this platform until
you have consumed the entire confection!

589
00:40:45.526 --> 00:40:47.699
Entire confection.

590
00:40:48.071 --> 00:40:50.369
See you at lunch.
Thank you, Cookie.

591
00:40:50.531 --> 00:40:54.286
Rotten kids.
You wanted cake, you got cake.

592
00:40:54.452 --> 00:40:56.875
Now, eat it!

593
00:41:10.593 --> 00:41:12.721
Poor Brucey.

594
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:47.718
He's going to puke.

595
00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:51.342
I can't look.
Is he going to puke?

596
00:41:51.509 --> 00:41:53.432
Without a doubt.

597
00:42:01.102 --> 00:42:02.775
Bruce looks real bad.

598
00:42:02.937 --> 00:42:05.110
Give up? Ha-ha-ha.

599
00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:12.033
You can do it, Brucey!

600
00:42:12.447 --> 00:42:14.700
You can do it, Bruce!

601
00:42:15.533 --> 00:42:16.910
Yeah, you can do it!

602
00:42:18.286 --> 00:42:20.630
Go, Bruce!

603
00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.957
<i>Bruce! Bruce! Bruce! Bruce! Bruce!</i>

604
00:42:27.587 --> 00:42:28.634
Silence!

605
00:42:32.133 --> 00:42:33.726
Yes!

606
00:42:33.968 --> 00:42:36.096
Yeah!

607
00:42:37.764 --> 00:42:38.811
Silence!

608
00:42:42.894 --> 00:42:45.488
Stop! Silence!

609
00:43:08.836 --> 00:43:11.430
Shut up! The entire assembly

610
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:15.469
will stay five hours after school
and copy from the dictionary.

611
00:43:15.968 --> 00:43:19.643
Any children who object
will go straight into the choky

612
00:43:19.806 --> 00:43:21.683
together!

613
00:43:27.188 --> 00:43:30.818
<i>Rescue 8 out of
Station 8, Los Angeles County.</i>

614
00:43:30.983 --> 00:43:35.079
<i>This was a Code R, an official way
of saying we've caught a bad one.</i>

615
00:43:35.238 --> 00:43:38.708
<i>The kind of accident where death
itself holds a stopwatch on us.</i>

616
00:43:41.244 --> 00:43:42.962
Young lady, where were you?

617
00:43:43.121 --> 00:43:46.375
Miss Trunchbull kept the whole school late
because this boy ate some chocolate cake.

618
00:43:46.541 --> 00:43:49.545
That's the biggest lie I ever heard.
You see those packages over there?

619
00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:52.964
They were left out for the world to see
because you weren't here to take them in.

620
00:43:53.131 --> 00:43:55.350
I don't think it's fair, bumpkins.
What?

621
00:43:55.508 --> 00:43:58.682
You get all this stuff from
catalogs, and I don't get anything.

622
00:43:58.845 --> 00:44:02.440
It's not catalogs, it's car parts, sweetness.
It's business.

623
00:44:02.598 --> 00:44:05.568
Oh, if it's business, why don't
you have it sent to the office?

624
00:44:05.726 --> 00:44:07.728
Because the cops may
be watching the office.

625
00:44:07.895 --> 00:44:10.148
The cops are watching
the house.

626
00:44:10.314 --> 00:44:13.409
What?
They're parked outside right now.

627
00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:15.908
You are such an ignoramus.

628
00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:20.075
Those are speedboat salesmen.
Really nice guys.

629
00:44:20.241 --> 00:44:21.914
Cops.

630
00:44:24.078 --> 00:44:27.503
Speedboats? There are
no lakes around here.

631
00:44:27.665 --> 00:44:31.135
Yeah, but some people like
to go away on the weekends.

632
00:44:31.294 --> 00:44:34.468
Some people have fun.
And some people are cops.

633
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:36.598
They are not cops.
Are too.

634
00:44:36.757 --> 00:44:39.260
They are not. I ought to know
if there's cops watching my house.

635
00:44:39.427 --> 00:44:42.431
Now, go to bed,
you lying little earwig.

636
00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:45.813
<i>With the FBI watching her father</i>

637
00:44:45.975 --> 00:44:48.398
<i>and the Trunchbull
terrorising her school,</i>

638
00:44:48.561 --> 00:44:52.361
<i>it was a rare, happy moment when Matilda
could just play with her friends.</i>

639
00:44:52.523 --> 00:44:55.868
A frog! A frog! A frog!

640
00:44:56.736 --> 00:45:00.206
What is it, Lavender?
A frog!

641
00:45:02.158 --> 00:45:03.375
It's a salamander.

642
00:45:03.534 --> 00:45:05.457
- It's a chameleon.
- It's a newt.

643
00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:10.091
“Any of the small semiaquatic
salamanders from the genus Triturus."

644
00:45:10.249 --> 00:45:14.880
“Some are brightly colored and
secrete irritating substances."

645
00:45:18.299 --> 00:45:20.597
How could you keep going...?

646
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:24.310
Useless, flaming car!

647
00:45:25.139 --> 00:45:26.561
Wormwood!

648
00:45:26.807 --> 00:45:28.400
Sell me a lemon?

649
00:45:28.559 --> 00:45:30.561
You're heading for
the choky, young lady!

650
00:45:30.728 --> 00:45:31.820
Choky?
Teach you a lesson.

651
00:45:31.979 --> 00:45:33.105
What lesson?

652
00:45:33.272 --> 00:45:35.570
You and your father think
you can make a fool out of me!

653
00:45:35.733 --> 00:45:38.282
My father?
The guy with that stupid haircut!

654
00:45:38.611 --> 00:45:42.616
I'm nothing like my father.
You're the spitting image.

655
00:45:42.823 --> 00:45:45.872
The apple never rots far
from the tree.

656
00:45:46.994 --> 00:45:48.086
Miss Honey!

657
00:45:48.246 --> 00:45:50.374
Miss Trunchbull teaches
our class today, Lavender.

658
00:45:50.539 --> 00:45:52.041
Please get a water pitcher.
But Miss Honey--

659
00:45:52.208 --> 00:45:55.337
Shh, shh. Quickly. She'll be
here any second. Come on.

660
00:45:56.379 --> 00:46:00.179
Make sure the water's cold, Lavender.
Hurry. Vinnie, cover the fish.

661
00:46:00.841 --> 00:46:03.890
Put away the art projects.
Put away anything colorful.

662
00:46:04.053 --> 00:46:05.646
Oh, Charlie, won't you get
those crayons for me.

663
00:46:05.805 --> 00:46:09.480
<i>Most great ideas come from
hard work and careful planning.</i>

664
00:46:09.642 --> 00:46:13.363
<i>Of course, once in a while,
they just jump out at you.</i>

665
00:46:13.521 --> 00:46:16.149
Raina, cover the birds and beetles.
Hurry! Hurry!

666
00:46:16.315 --> 00:46:18.363
I hear her coming.
Okay, now,

667
00:46:18.526 --> 00:46:21.245
last time, some of you
forgot yourselves.

668
00:46:21.404 --> 00:46:25.204
Don't speak unless you're spoken to.
Don't laugh. Don't smile.

669
00:46:25.366 --> 00:46:27.494
Don't even breathe loudly.

670
00:46:27.743 --> 00:46:30.212
Don't breathe at all.

671
00:46:32.456 --> 00:46:34.049
Morning, Miss Trunchbull.

672
00:46:34.208 --> 00:46:36.427
Good morning, Miss Trunchbull.

673
00:46:38.045 --> 00:46:39.171
Sit!

674
00:46:43.718 --> 00:46:45.686
Shoo!

675
00:46:48.014 --> 00:46:52.520
I have never been able to understand
why small children are so disgusting.

676
00:46:52.685 --> 00:46:54.904
They're the bane of my life.

677
00:46:55.062 --> 00:46:57.485
They're like insects.
Where's <i>Matilda?</i>

678
00:46:57.648 --> 00:47:00.993
They should be got
rid of as early as possible.

679
00:47:01.277 --> 00:47:02.824
Fsht!

680
00:47:03.404 --> 00:47:05.577
My idea of a perfect school

681
00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:10.621
is one in which there
are no children at all.

682
00:47:11.746 --> 00:47:14.215
Do you agree, Miss Honey?

683
00:47:18.127 --> 00:47:19.219
Now,

684
00:47:19.879 --> 00:47:22.758
you, front of the class!

685
00:47:28.763 --> 00:47:30.936
Are you okay?

686
00:47:31.932 --> 00:47:36.028
Next time I tell you to empty
your pockets, you'll do it faster, won't you?

687
00:47:36.187 --> 00:47:38.610
- Yes, Miss Trunchbull.
- Miss Honey.

688
00:47:39.148 --> 00:47:43.119
This could be the most interesting
thing you've ever done.

689
00:47:46.447 --> 00:47:49.041
Sit down, you squirming
worm of vomit!

690
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:51.578
Thank you, Miss Trunchbull.

691
00:48:01.087 --> 00:48:02.805
Get up!

692
00:48:05.299 --> 00:48:06.346
Can you spell?

693
00:48:06.592 --> 00:48:09.687
Miss Honey taught us how
to spell a long word yesterday.

694
00:48:09.845 --> 00:48:11.597
We can spell "difficulty."

695
00:48:11.764 --> 00:48:15.485
You couldn't spell "difficulty"
if your life depended on it.

696
00:48:15.935 --> 00:48:17.687
She taught us with a poem.

697
00:48:17.853 --> 00:48:19.526
A poem, how sweet.

698
00:48:19.688 --> 00:48:25.115
<i>What poem would that be?
Mrs. D, Mrs. I</i>

699
00:48:25.277 --> 00:48:27.746
Mrs. F-F-I

700
00:48:27.905 --> 00:48:32.411
<i>Mrs. C, Mrs. U
Mrs. L-T-Y</i>

701
00:48:33.327 --> 00:48:35.500
Why are
all these women married?

702
00:48:35.663 --> 00:48:40.009
Mrs. D? Mrs. I? You're supposed
to be teaching spelling, not poetry!

703
00:48:45.756 --> 00:48:50.387
I cannot, for the life of me, understand why
small children take so long to grow up.

704
00:48:50.553 --> 00:48:53.306
I think they do it deliberately
just to annoy me.

705
00:49:02.273 --> 00:49:04.446
Shh, shh, shh, Shh.

706
00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:11.953
What's funny? Hm?

707
00:49:12.199 --> 00:49:14.952
Come on, spit it out.
Speak up.

708
00:49:15.119 --> 00:49:18.043
I like a joke as well
as the next fat person.

709
00:49:23.586 --> 00:49:26.965
Ah! It's a snake. It's a snake!

710
00:49:27.965 --> 00:49:29.842
It's a snake! Uch!

711
00:49:31.844 --> 00:49:35.269
One of you tried
to poison me. Who?

712
00:49:36.557 --> 00:49:38.559
Matilda.

713
00:49:38.726 --> 00:49:39.773
I knew it!

714
00:49:40.019 --> 00:49:43.740
I just thought you'd like to know,
it's not a snake. It's a newt.

715
00:49:43.898 --> 00:49:46.868
What did you say?
It's a newt.

716
00:49:47.026 --> 00:49:52.248
Stand up, you villainous sack
of goat slime! You did this.

717
00:49:52.406 --> 00:49:53.532
No, Miss Trunchbull.

718
00:49:53.699 --> 00:49:58.205
Did you act alone,
or did you have accomplices?

719
00:49:58.370 --> 00:49:59.997
I didn't do it.

720
00:50:00.164 --> 00:50:02.587
You didn't like
the choky, did you?

721
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:04.844
Thought you'd
pay me back, didn't you?

722
00:50:05.002 --> 00:50:08.131
Well, I'll pay you back,
young lady.

723
00:50:08.297 --> 00:50:11.346
For what, Miss Trunchbull?
For this newt, you piss-worm!

724
00:50:11.509 --> 00:50:14.433
I'm telling you, I didn't do it!

725
00:50:15.095 --> 00:50:17.518
Besides, even if you didn't
do it, I'm gonna punish you

726
00:50:17.681 --> 00:50:21.436
because I'm big and you're small,
and I'm right and you're wrong.

727
00:50:21.602 --> 00:50:24.196
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

728
00:50:24.355 --> 00:50:28.280
You're a liar and a scoundrel,
and your father's a liar and a cheat.

729
00:50:28.442 --> 00:50:32.948
You're the most corrupt lowlifes
in the history of civilization.

730
00:50:33.113 --> 00:50:35.616
Am I wrong'? I'm never wrong.

731
00:50:36.242 --> 00:50:42.124
In this classroom,
in this school, I am God!

732
00:51:13.779 --> 00:51:15.497
You!
I didn't move.

733
00:51:16.156 --> 00:51:17.703
You did this!

734
00:51:17.866 --> 00:51:21.996
How could she possibly have done it
when she was sitting way over here?

735
00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:26.550
I'll be watching you,
each and every one.

736
00:51:26.709 --> 00:51:28.382
When you turn the corner,

737
00:51:28.544 --> 00:51:31.673
when you go to your cubbies
to get your smelly coats,

738
00:51:31.839 --> 00:51:33.841
when you skip merrily to lunch,

739
00:51:34.008 --> 00:51:36.852
I'll be watching you, all of you,

740
00:51:37.011 --> 00:51:39.560
and especially you.

741
00:51:48.814 --> 00:51:50.657
Oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry.

742
00:51:51.191 --> 00:51:54.866
Thanks for not telling.
Best friends don't tell.

743
00:51:56.614 --> 00:51:58.958
She can really dance.

744
00:52:00.534 --> 00:52:04.004
I'm gonna clean up this mess, and then I'll
come and help you fill the bird feeder, okay?

745
00:52:04.163 --> 00:52:06.382
I'll be out there in a minute.

746
00:52:08.751 --> 00:52:11.504
Miss Honey?
Yes, Matilda?

747
00:52:13.213 --> 00:52:15.966
Miss Honey, I did it.

748
00:52:16.508 --> 00:52:19.057
Did what?
I made the glass tip over.

749
00:52:19.219 --> 00:52:23.224
Oh, sweetheart, don't let Miss
Trunchbull make you feel that way.

750
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:25.063
Nobody did it.
it was an accident.

751
00:52:25.225 --> 00:52:29.230
I did it with my eyes.
Watch, I'll prove it to you.

752
00:52:32.733 --> 00:52:35.031
It's wonderful you feel
so powerful.

753
00:52:35.819 --> 00:52:39.073
Many people don't feel
powerful at all.

754
00:52:48.415 --> 00:52:52.921
Come on, tip over, you glass.
Glass, tip over. Tip over.

755
00:52:53.087 --> 00:52:55.590
Come on, tip over.
Tip over, glass.

756
00:52:55.756 --> 00:52:57.429
It's all right, Matilda.

757
00:53:01.095 --> 00:53:04.349
I really did do it, Miss Honey.

758
00:53:04.515 --> 00:53:08.611
One of the odd things about life
is sometimes you can do something

759
00:53:08.769 --> 00:53:11.864
until you wanna show someone,
and then you can't.

760
00:53:12.022 --> 00:53:14.946
Or sometimes you think something's broken
and then you take it to be fixed--

761
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:16.736
This isn't like that.

762
00:53:17.361 --> 00:53:18.453
Oh.

763
00:53:19.363 --> 00:53:21.411
I don't know.

764
00:53:22.282 --> 00:53:24.956
Maybe I made myself tired.

765
00:53:26.161 --> 00:53:29.210
Matilda, would you like to come
over to my house this afternoon?

766
00:53:30.124 --> 00:53:32.468
I'd like that very much,
Miss Honey.

767
00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:34.552
Good.

768
00:53:36.797 --> 00:53:39.801
I just stare very hard,
and then my eyes get all hot,

769
00:53:39.967 --> 00:53:42.311
and I can feel the strongness.

770
00:53:42.469 --> 00:53:46.474
I feel like I can move
almost anything in the world.

771
00:53:47.182 --> 00:53:49.355
You do believe me,
don't you?

772
00:53:49.518 --> 00:53:51.646
Oh, I believe that you should
believe in whatever power

773
00:53:51.812 --> 00:53:56.659
you think you have inside of you.
Believe it with all your heart.

774
00:53:59.528 --> 00:54:02.498
That's where
Miss Trunchbull lives.

775
00:54:04.533 --> 00:54:06.331
Why is there a swing?

776
00:54:07.661 --> 00:54:13.168
A girl I know used to live in that house.
Her life was good and happy.

777
00:54:13.333 --> 00:54:17.304
<i>When she was just 2 years old,
her mother died.</i>

778
00:54:17.463 --> 00:54:19.215
<i>Her father was a doctor,</i>

779
00:54:19.381 --> 00:54:22.180
<i>and he needed someone
to look after things at home,</i>

780
00:54:22.342 --> 00:54:25.721
<i>so he invited the mother's stepsister
to come and live with him.</i>

781
00:54:25.888 --> 00:54:30.268
<i>But the girl's aunt was a mean person
who treated the girl very badly.</i>

782
00:54:30.434 --> 00:54:33.608
<i>- The Trunchbull.
- Yes.</i>

783
00:54:33.771 --> 00:54:37.867
<i>And worst of all,
when the girl was 5, her father died.</i>

784
00:54:38.025 --> 00:54:39.493
<i>How did her father die?</i>

785
00:54:39.651 --> 00:54:42.495
<i>The police decided
he'd killed himself.</i>

786
00:54:42.654 --> 00:54:44.406
<i>Why would he do such a thing?</i>

787
00:54:44.573 --> 00:54:46.541
<i>No one knows.</i>

788
00:54:50.913 --> 00:54:52.711
The end is happier.

789
00:54:52.873 --> 00:54:54.546
She found a small cottage.

790
00:54:54.708 --> 00:54:58.588
She rented it from this lovely
rhubarb farmer for just $50 a month

791
00:54:58.754 --> 00:55:02.384
and she covered it in honeysuckle, and
she planted hundreds of wildflowers

792
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:05.723
and she moved out of her wicked aunt's
house and she finally got her freedom.

793
00:55:05.886 --> 00:55:07.980
Good for her.

794
00:55:08.138 --> 00:55:11.233
Do you know why I told you this?
No.

795
00:55:13.894 --> 00:55:17.239
You were born into a family that
doesn't always appreciate you,

796
00:55:17.773 --> 00:55:21.243
but one day, things are
gonna be very different.

797
00:55:25.739 --> 00:55:28.709
Should we go inside
and have tea and cookies?

798
00:55:28.867 --> 00:55:30.619
Yes, please.
Okay.

799
00:55:35.290 --> 00:55:38.920
This is the cottage from your story.
Yes.

800
00:55:39.837 --> 00:55:42.386
The young woman is you.

801
00:55:43.799 --> 00:55:45.801
But then--

802
00:55:46.301 --> 00:55:49.475
No.
Yes.

803
00:55:49.638 --> 00:55:51.936
Aunt Trunchbull.

804
00:55:55.853 --> 00:55:58.322
When I left my home,
Aunt Trunchbull's home,

805
00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:00.608
I had to leave
all my treasures behind.

806
00:56:01.191 --> 00:56:05.617
Treasures?
Photographs of my mother and father,

807
00:56:05.821 --> 00:56:10.076
and a beautiful doll my mother
gave me with a china face.

808
00:56:10.242 --> 00:56:12.290
Lissy Doll, I called her.

809
00:56:12.452 --> 00:56:15.046
Would you like some milk?
Yes, please.

810
00:56:16.582 --> 00:56:19.176
Why don't you run away?

811
00:56:20.377 --> 00:56:24.507
I've often thought about it,
but I can't abandon my children.

812
00:56:24.673 --> 00:56:27.847
And if I couldn't teach,
I'd have nothing at all.

813
00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:30.809
You're very brave, Miss Honey.

814
00:56:31.805 --> 00:56:33.728
Not as brave as you.

815
00:56:33.891 --> 00:56:36.644
I thought grownups
weren't afraid of anything.

816
00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:38.153
Quite the contrary.

817
00:56:38.645 --> 00:56:41.774
All grownups get scared,
just like children.

818
00:56:42.649 --> 00:56:46.153
I wonder what
Miss Trunchbull is afraid of.

819
00:56:53.368 --> 00:56:55.666
There she is.

820
00:57:02.044 --> 00:57:03.921
Shot put.

821
00:57:04.087 --> 00:57:05.304
Hammer throw.

822
00:57:05.464 --> 00:57:07.558
Javelin.

823
00:57:18.852 --> 00:57:20.229
Back, back, back, back!

824
00:57:20.604 --> 00:57:22.356
She's afraid of a cat?

825
00:57:22.522 --> 00:57:24.775
Black cats.
She's very superstitious.

826
00:57:24.983 --> 00:57:26.155
Go!

827
00:57:27.945 --> 00:57:29.538
Go!

828
00:57:32.199 --> 00:57:33.542
Oh.

829
00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:36.036
Poor kitty.

830
00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:39.374
Oh, he's all right.
Hopefully.

831
00:57:46.254 --> 00:57:49.133
Let's go get your treasures.
No, Matilda.

832
00:57:49.299 --> 00:57:52.929
Well, she's gone. Come on.

833
00:57:55.555 --> 00:57:59.105
Matilda!
Miss Honey.

834
00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:09.240
Come on, move, you
piece of junkyard fodder.

835
00:58:09.403 --> 00:58:11.576
Shift, you-- No, no.

836
00:58:19.955 --> 00:58:22.504
My house.

837
00:58:30.966 --> 00:58:33.344
Oh, my.

838
00:58:36.096 --> 00:58:38.815
My father's portrait
used to hang there.

839
00:58:38.974 --> 00:58:42.524
Whoever painted the Trunchbull
must have had a strong stomach.

840
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:45.272
A really strong stomach.

841
00:59:07.502 --> 00:59:08.879
We should go.

842
00:59:09.629 --> 00:59:12.599
Father's chocolate box.

843
00:59:16.678 --> 00:59:20.933
After supper, he'd take
a chocolate, cut it in half,

844
00:59:21.099 --> 00:59:23.522
and he'd always
give me the bigger half.

845
00:59:24.311 --> 00:59:27.736
When he died, Trunchbull would count
them so I couldn't even sneak one.

846
00:59:27.898 --> 00:59:32.495
She'd take a chocolate,
bring it to her lips and say:

847
00:59:32.652 --> 00:59:35.246
Much too good for children.

848
00:59:40.202 --> 00:59:42.330
Have one.

849
00:59:45.916 --> 00:59:49.420
No, she'd notice.

850
00:59:49.586 --> 00:59:53.011
Where's Lissy Doll?
Upstairs.

851
00:59:55.092 --> 00:59:56.685
Matilda.

852
00:59:59.346 --> 01:00:00.438
What?

853
01:00:02.182 --> 01:00:03.354
Matilda.

854
01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:12.738
You filthy--
Crush the little weasel!

855
01:00:13.527 --> 01:00:16.121
This is my room.

856
01:00:21.535 --> 01:00:23.128
That's my dad.

857
01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:25.960
What's his name?
Magnus.

858
01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:30.219
I used to call him King Magnus
and he called me Bumblebee.

859
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:34.594
I don't think Magnus
killed himself.

860
01:00:34.756 --> 01:00:36.224
Neither do I.

861
01:00:38.385 --> 01:00:39.887
Is that Lissy Doll?

862
01:00:43.515 --> 01:00:47.440
Wormwood, you
useless, used-car-salesman scum!

863
01:00:47.602 --> 01:00:51.607
I want you around here now
with another car!

864
01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:56.411
Yes, I know what caveat emptor
means, you lowlife liar!

865
01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:58.993
I'm gonna sue you. I'm gonna
burn down your showroom!

866
01:00:59.156 --> 01:01:02.535
I'm gonna take that no-good jalopy you
sold me and shove it up your bazooga!

867
01:01:02.701 --> 01:01:06.046
When I'm finished with you,
you're gonna look like roadkill!

868
01:01:06.204 --> 01:01:08.047
You what? Ha, ha, you--

869
01:01:31.479 --> 01:01:33.197
Come on.

870
01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:40.868
Shouldn't we hide or something?
Yeah. Yeah, go.

871
01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:44.251
Go to the end of the hall, down the
stairs and out the kitchen door.

872
01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:46.377
I'll distract her.

873
01:01:55.003 --> 01:01:58.428
Who's in my house?!

874
01:02:03.345 --> 01:02:05.222
Come out and fight like a man!

875
01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:40.347
Aha!

876
01:03:01.361 --> 01:03:03.284
Tallyho!

877
01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.127
Oh.

878
01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:04.098
Oh!

879
01:05:06.486 --> 01:05:08.534
Come on, come on.

880
01:05:26.673 --> 01:05:28.346
Come on, over there.

881
01:05:29.134 --> 01:05:32.855
Some rats are gonna die today.

882
01:06:11.593 --> 01:06:14.142
Oh, my goodness.

883
01:06:15.221 --> 01:06:17.019
Feel my heart.

884
01:06:17.182 --> 01:06:21.062
Weren't you the most scared
you've ever been in your whole life?

885
01:06:24.564 --> 01:06:25.611
Come on, let's go.

886
01:06:25.773 --> 01:06:29.243
She shouldn't be allowed
to treat people like that.

887
01:06:29.402 --> 01:06:32.246
Somebody's gotta teach her a lesson.
I know.

888
01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:35.909
We'll wait until she leaves again,
then we'll go get your doll.

889
01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:38.336
What?
Just kidding.

890
01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:43.292
Come here.

891
01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:49.047
Matilda, promise me you will never
go back in that house again.

892
01:06:49.756 --> 01:06:51.474
I promise.

893
01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:54.473
Okay. Come on.

894
01:07:02.936 --> 01:07:07.316
Ha-ha-ha. So he came home
with $2000 cash

895
01:07:07.482 --> 01:07:09.450
and he threw it up in the air

896
01:07:09.609 --> 01:07:14.957
<i>and we both just swam in it like
we were on The Million Dollar Sticky.</i>

897
01:07:15.406 --> 01:07:17.784
Do you like that show?

898
01:07:17.951 --> 01:07:19.919
I love that show.

899
01:07:20.078 --> 01:07:21.546
That was the old days.

900
01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:25.584
Now he's got money in banks all over
this planet, and does he give me a dime?

901
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:29.971
Matilda, this is Bob and Bill.
They're cops.

902
01:07:30.463 --> 01:07:33.717
They are not cops. They are
Ace Powerboat salesmen.

903
01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:35.351
Babyface, I'm starved!

904
01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:39.189
Hi, Harry.

905
01:07:39.347 --> 01:07:40.974
Who are you?

906
01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:44.690
What is this, a hot tub party?
Get the hell out of here!

907
01:07:44.852 --> 01:07:48.823
I slave all day, I come home, you're entertaining
a couple of surfer-dude bodybuilders.

908
01:07:49.148 --> 01:07:50.570
They're cops, Dad.

909
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:53.578
You interested in time-share?
Get out of here.

910
01:07:54.237 --> 01:07:57.662
You don't let me talk to people.
I am in a cage, Harry.

911
01:07:57.824 --> 01:08:01.374
I need to talk to somebody
besides our stupid kids.

912
01:08:01.536 --> 01:08:05.257
Oh, yeah? A man is entitled to come
home and find dinner on the table

913
01:08:05.582 --> 01:08:08.335
without having to wade
through male strippers!

914
01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:10.378
Dad?
What do you want?

915
01:08:10.878 --> 01:08:14.553
- Yell at me, okay?
- Shut up and leave us alone!

916
01:08:15.383 --> 01:08:17.852
- Yell at me again.
- Yell at you?

917
01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:20.355
I'll come in and pound
your miserable hide!

918
01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:22.936
What do I have to do
to gain respect around here?!

919
01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:25.773
I'm gonna give you a tanning like
you've never had in your life!

920
01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:29.530
My word is my law!
You understand?! Law!

921
01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:36.575
<i>No kid likes being yelled at,</i>

922
01:08:36.738 --> 01:08:39.582
<i>but it was precisely
Harry's ranting and raving</i>

923
01:08:39.741 --> 01:08:42.039
<i>that gave Matilda
the key to her power.</i>

924
01:08:42.201 --> 01:08:46.627
<i>To unlock that power,
all she had to do was practice.</i>

925
01:08:56.883 --> 01:08:59.227
You're a little cheat.
What, are you stupid?

926
01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:02.514
I'm smart, you're dumb.
The apple never rots far from the tree.

927
01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:04.307
I think there is something
wrong with that girl.

928
01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:06.818
I'm right, you're wrong.
Hey, dip-face, here's your book.

929
01:09:06.976 --> 01:09:11.072
You're a Wormwood.
It's time you started acting like one!

930
01:09:49.268 --> 01:09:54.149
<i>♪ Little bitty pretty one
Come on and talk to me ♪</i>

931
01:09:54.732 --> 01:09:59.829
<i>♪ Lovey dovey lovey one
Come sit down on my knee ♪</i>

932
01:10:11.165 --> 01:10:16.046
<i>♪ Tell you a story
Happened long time ago ♪</i>

933
01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:21.434
<i>♪ Little bitty pretty one
I've been watchin' you grow ♪</i>

934
01:10:21.968 --> 01:10:25.939
<i>That was my personal favorite played
especially for all you little bitty pretty ones</i>

935
01:10:26.097 --> 01:10:27.815
<i>moving and grooving
on this sunny afternoon.</i>

936
01:10:27.974 --> 01:10:31.228
<i>Playing music to make you smile,
so you'd better not touch that d--</i>

937
01:10:43.489 --> 01:10:45.287
Shouldn't we have a search
warrant to do this?

938
01:10:45.450 --> 01:10:47.828
No, this guy's dirty.

939
01:10:47.994 --> 01:10:51.874
Once we show this tape in court,
Wormwood's goose is cooked.

940
01:10:52.039 --> 01:10:55.589
I'm sure that box is full
of stolen car parts.

941
01:10:55.835 --> 01:10:57.678
You've been taping all week.

942
01:10:57.837 --> 01:11:00.681
How about letting me handle
that camera for a while?

943
01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:02.592
You know how to use it?

944
01:11:02.759 --> 01:11:05.353
You know about the zoom
and the white balance?

945
01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:09.482
You know how to adjust the eyepiece?
I can handle it.

946
01:11:12.727 --> 01:11:15.196
Besides, it's my turn.

947
01:11:15.354 --> 01:11:17.948
Yeah, your turn to drop it.

948
01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:20.860
I won't drop it.

949
01:11:21.027 --> 01:11:22.745
Come on.

950
01:11:23.154 --> 01:11:27.204
You two men are gonna be
in a lot of trouble very soon.

951
01:11:27.366 --> 01:11:30.040
It's the female minor.

952
01:11:31.329 --> 01:11:33.172
Aren't you supposed
to be in school, young lady?

953
01:11:33.331 --> 01:11:35.379
I really hope you have
a search warrant.

954
01:11:35.541 --> 01:11:38.841
According to a constitutional
law book I read in the library,

955
01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:43.383
if you don't have one, you could lose
your job or even go to federal prison.

956
01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.723
It's your father who's
going to federal prison.

957
01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:49.059
And you know where you'll end up?
In a federal orphanage.

958
01:11:49.222 --> 01:11:51.645
If you cooperate, we'll make
sure it's a nice orphanage.

959
01:11:52.016 --> 01:11:56.066
The kind with food
and teeny-weeny cockroaches.

960
01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:57.276
What do you say?

961
01:11:58.731 --> 01:12:03.487
There's another crime in the making.
Your car's about to run a stop sign.

962
01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:18.259
<i>So she bought a little time
for her dad to come to his senses.</i>

963
01:12:18.417 --> 01:12:21.421
<i>But now Matilda had
bigger fish to fry,</i>

964
01:12:21.587 --> 01:12:23.635
<i>much bigger.</i>

965
01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:41.942
Hey, dip-face,
where are you going?

966
01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:44.156
Out.

967
01:12:46.445 --> 01:12:49.949
Hey, dip-face, have a carrot.

968
01:13:03.296 --> 01:13:06.140
Chew your food.
You're an animal.

969
01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:13.472
<i>Having power
isn't nearly as important</i>

970
01:13:13.639 --> 01:13:15.562
<i>as what you choose to do with it.</i>

971
01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:19.901
<i>And what Matilda had in mind
was nothing short of heroic.</i>

972
01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:46.990
Come here. Come on.
Lissy Doll, come on.

973
01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:50.153
Come, Lissy. Come on, doll.
Please. Come on.

974
01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:52.447
Come on, Lissy.
Please come here.

975
01:15:08.295 --> 01:15:09.797
Yes!

976
01:16:53.192 --> 01:16:55.536
Leave me alone!

977
01:17:29.353 --> 01:17:31.401
Magnus!

978
01:18:30.623 --> 01:18:35.094
Miss Honey! Miss Honey,
you'll never believe what I got you.

979
01:18:36.295 --> 01:18:38.639
Oh, Matilda.

980
01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:42.305
Matilda.
Oh, I also brought you this.

981
01:18:42.468 --> 01:18:44.311
I ate mine last night.

982
01:18:58.901 --> 01:19:02.201
I will be teaching
your class today.

983
01:19:08.494 --> 01:19:11.873
<i>In the time it took Miss
Honey to get very, very nervous,</i>

984
01:19:12.039 --> 01:19:15.088
<i>Matilda had formulated a plan.</i>

985
01:19:15.542 --> 01:19:18.011
She is really raving mad.

986
01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:21.595
What is it your father used to call you?
Hummingbird?

987
01:19:21.757 --> 01:19:25.261
Bumblebee. I'm sure
she knows the doll's missing.

988
01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:27.304
And he called her
Trunchbull?

989
01:19:27.471 --> 01:19:31.101
No, I suppose he called her
Agatha. Yes, that's--

990
01:19:31.267 --> 01:19:35.488
She called him Magnus, right?
Yeah. Yes.

991
01:19:35.646 --> 01:19:39.867
Maybe I could go back to the house and put
the doll back while she's still at school.

992
01:19:40.067 --> 01:19:43.537
Tsk. No, I can't do that.
Calm down, Miss Honey. Really.

993
01:19:43.696 --> 01:19:45.619
It's gonna be okay,
I promise.

994
01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:49.202
Sweetheart, you promised you wouldn't
go back in that house again.

995
01:19:49.368 --> 01:19:53.623
I didn't. I was on the garage roof.
I did it with my powers.

996
01:19:53.956 --> 01:19:56.505
Okay, on the garage roof
with your powers.

997
01:19:56.667 --> 01:20:00.046
All right, I need to think.
Let's see.

998
01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:20.908
Powers.
Mm-hm.

999
01:20:27.114 --> 01:20:30.744
I think I've got them down.
Watch this.

1000
01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:51.438
No more Miss Nice Girl.

1001
01:20:53.599 --> 01:20:56.603
Get inside.
Inside! Quickly, run!

1002
01:20:56.769 --> 01:20:59.773
Run! Get against the wall!
Against that wall. Quickly!

1003
01:20:59.938 --> 01:21:01.736
Don't make me wait.

1004
01:21:01.899 --> 01:21:03.993
Water!

1005
01:21:04.943 --> 01:21:07.366
And hold the newt.

1006
01:21:11.283 --> 01:21:13.786
Join the ranks. Move!

1007
01:21:16.955 --> 01:21:21.131
I am here to teach
you all a lesson.

1008
01:21:24.797 --> 01:21:30.224
Sometimes in life, horrible
and unexplainable things happen.

1009
01:21:33.847 --> 01:21:38.193
These things are a test of character.

1010
01:21:42.481 --> 01:21:44.700
And I have character.

1011
01:21:44.858 --> 01:21:49.409
Form a line across the room! Quickly!
Run, run, run! Don't keep me waiting.

1012
01:21:49.822 --> 01:21:51.324
Fill this gap!

1013
01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:57.000
I expect you're wondering
what I'm talking about. Hm?

1014
01:21:57.496 --> 01:21:59.590
Yes.

1015
01:21:59.748 --> 01:22:03.093
A child came to my house.

1016
01:22:03.252 --> 01:22:07.007
I don't know how, I don't
know when, I don't know why.

1017
01:22:07.172 --> 01:22:09.846
Miss Trunchbull, may I--?
No, you may not.

1018
01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:13.979
But I know a child came.

1019
01:22:14.138 --> 01:22:17.859
So did you know it was illegal

1020
01:22:18.016 --> 01:22:21.691
to enter someone's home
without their permission?

1021
01:22:21.854 --> 01:22:25.700
Yes, Miss Trunchbull.
Sir.

1022
01:22:25.858 --> 01:22:28.077
Stand straight!
Stomachs in! Shoulders back!

1023
01:22:29.695 --> 01:22:32.198
Do any of you recognize...

1024
01:22:33.198 --> 01:22:34.871
this?

1025
01:22:35.033 --> 01:22:36.626
Hmm?

1026
01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:39.413
Let's play a game. Shall we?

1027
01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:45.053
Who was wearing a pretty
red hair ribbon yesterday

1028
01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:48.054
and isn't wearing one today?

1029
01:22:48.213 --> 01:22:51.308
Can you answer me that?

1030
01:22:51.467 --> 01:22:56.724
Who does this
disgusting ribbon belong to?

1031
01:22:58.015 --> 01:22:59.892
I shall personally see to it

1032
01:23:00.058 --> 01:23:03.562
that the demented, drooling,
slime-breathed little Lilliputian

1033
01:23:03.729 --> 01:23:06.403
who owns this disgusting ribbon

1034
01:23:06.565 --> 01:23:11.071
will never see the light
of day again. You.

1035
01:23:11.236 --> 01:23:14.786
Miss Trunchbull, I was the one who was
at your house last night. I know what--

1036
01:23:14.948 --> 01:23:18.748
I broke your arm once before,
I can do it again, Jenny.

1037
01:23:18.911 --> 01:23:21.460
I am not 7 years old
anymore, Aunt Trunchbull.

1038
01:23:24.249 --> 01:23:26.593
Shut your holes!

1039
01:23:26.752 --> 01:23:29.426
You will be put away in a place

1040
01:23:29.588 --> 01:23:34.344
where not even the crows
can land their droppings on you.

1041
01:23:34.593 --> 01:23:35.765
Look.

1042
01:23:36.929 --> 01:23:39.523
- The chalk.
- The chalk.

1043
01:23:39.681 --> 01:23:42.025
- Chalk.
- The blinds.

1044
01:23:46.605 --> 01:23:49.950
"A."
"Agatha...

1045
01:23:52.611 --> 01:23:55.160
this is Magnus.

1046
01:23:57.449 --> 01:23:59.497
Give my...

1047
01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:01.788
little Bumblebee...

1048
01:24:01.954 --> 01:24:05.003
her house...

1049
01:24:05.165 --> 01:24:06.963
and her money."

1050
01:24:07.125 --> 01:24:10.470
- Money?
- "Then get out of town.

1051
01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:13.883
If you don't, I will get you.

1052
01:24:14.049 --> 01:24:18.099
I will get you like you got me.

1053
01:24:18.262 --> 01:24:20.356
That is a promise."

1054
01:25:39.217 --> 01:25:41.970
No, no, Miss Trunchbull,
please don't throw him.

1055
01:25:52.022 --> 01:25:55.071
Woo-hoo-hoo! Woo-hoo!

1056
01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:50.464
- Lavender!
- Lavender!

1057
01:26:55.377 --> 01:26:58.221
- Neat!
- That's cool.

1058
01:27:07.931 --> 01:27:10.150
It's the Trunch.

1059
01:27:12.561 --> 01:27:15.781
Wow!
Hey, you guys, look at this.

1060
01:27:15.939 --> 01:27:17.566
Yes!

1061
01:27:20.527 --> 01:27:22.325
Let go.

1062
01:27:25.031 --> 01:27:29.787
Wow. Cool. I didn't know
I could do that.

1063
01:27:29.953 --> 01:27:32.001
Pretty good, huh?

1064
01:27:39.129 --> 01:27:40.972
Aah!

1065
01:27:47.179 --> 01:27:49.352
Yeah!

1066
01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:23.216
<i>And the Trunchbull was gone,
never to be seen or heard from,</i>

1067
01:28:23.381 --> 01:28:26.180
<i>never to darken a doorway again.</i>

1068
01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:30.894
<i>Miss Honey moved back
into her father's house.</i>

1069
01:28:31.056 --> 01:28:32.399
Teatime.

1070
01:28:32.557 --> 01:28:34.355
<i>Of course, Matilda was
a frequent visitor.</i>

1071
01:28:34.518 --> 01:28:38.944
Did you know that the heart of a mouse
beats at the rate of 650 times a minute?

1072
01:28:39.231 --> 01:28:42.280
My, where'd you learn that?
In a book.

1073
01:28:42.442 --> 01:28:46.072
It beats so fast, it doesn't sound like beating at all.
it sounds like it's humming.

1074
01:28:46.279 --> 01:28:49.408
A porcupine's heart beats
300 times a minute.

1075
01:28:49.991 --> 01:28:51.993
- All right.
- Quick!

1076
01:28:52.494 --> 01:28:53.791
Hey, you.

1077
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:57.834
Hey, we're leaving. Let's go.
Get in the car. Hurry up.

1078
01:28:58.291 --> 01:29:01.010
Let's wrap up these cookies.
Come on, we're leaving. Now.

1079
01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:02.842
I'd be happy
to walk her home.

1080
01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:05.845
Well, nobody will be there.
We're moving to Guam.

1081
01:29:06.007 --> 01:29:07.509
Come on, let's go.
Guam?

1082
01:29:07.676 --> 01:29:09.724
Daddy's not gonna be in
the auto business anymore.

1083
01:29:09.928 --> 01:29:12.181
I don't want to leave.

1084
01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:14.315
But we're going
on a permanent vacation.

1085
01:29:14.683 --> 01:29:17.277
Yeah, and we gotta beat the
speedboat salesmen to the airport.

1086
01:29:17.435 --> 01:29:21.030
I love it here.
I love my school. It isn't fair.

1087
01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:22.532
Miss Honey, please
don't let them take me.

1088
01:29:22.691 --> 01:29:24.113
Get in the car, Melinda.
Matilda.

1089
01:29:24.276 --> 01:29:26.404
Whatever.
I want to stay with Miss Honey.

1090
01:29:26.570 --> 01:29:28.368
Well, Miss Honey
doesn't want you.

1091
01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:30.624
Why would she want some
snotty, disobedient kid?

1092
01:29:30.782 --> 01:29:34.457
Because she's a spectacularly
wonderful child, and I love her.

1093
01:29:34.911 --> 01:29:38.336
Adopt me, Miss Honey.
You can adopt me.

1094
01:29:38.498 --> 01:29:40.626
Look, I don't have time
for all these legalities.

1095
01:29:40.792 --> 01:29:43.136
One second, Dad,
I have the adoption papers.

1096
01:29:43.295 --> 01:29:44.717
What?

1097
01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:47.258
Hey, where'd you get those?
From a book in the library.

1098
01:29:47.424 --> 01:29:49.722
I've had them since
I was big enough to Xerox.

1099
01:29:49.968 --> 01:29:52.096
Are you hearing this, Harry?

1100
01:29:53.555 --> 01:29:56.729
All you have to do is sign them.
I'll be an only child again.

1101
01:29:56.892 --> 01:30:00.863
Shut up! I can't think
with all these sirens.

1102
01:30:02.606 --> 01:30:04.825
What do you think, pumpkin?

1103
01:30:07.319 --> 01:30:10.323
You're the only daughter
I ever had, Matilda.

1104
01:30:10.488 --> 01:30:14.243
And I never understood you,
not one little bit.

1105
01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:19.339
Who's got a pen?

1106
01:30:20.999 --> 01:30:24.003
Here.
Thanks.

1107
01:30:25.837 --> 01:30:29.717
<i>And doing, perhaps, the first decent
thing they ever did for their daughter,</i>

1108
01:30:29.883 --> 01:30:33.478

the adoption papers.</i>

1109
01:30:33.845 --> 01:30:36.769

Okay.

1110
01:30:39.559 --> 01:30:42.654
All right, come on. Here.
Turn around.

1111
01:30:45.774 --> 01:30:48.527
You're not gonna be calling us for support
payments or something like that, huh?

1112
01:30:48.693 --> 01:30:51.822
Oh, no, no. We'll have everything we need.
Don't worry.

1113
