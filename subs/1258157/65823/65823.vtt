-I don't know, Shaggy.

Oh, no.

You're okay. I was gonna call you

You were gonna call me?

521
00:37:05.431 --> 00:37:08.433
Yeah, I didn't-- I thought
if you got stuck in the school...

522
00:37:08.601 --> 00:37:11.394
...then we'd all get in more trouble,
I didn't want that so--

00:38:05.157 --> 00:38:08.827

VELMA:
Way ahead of you, Freddie.

544
00:38:10.705 --> 00:38:14.207
I analyzed that green residue
from the gym floor. And guess what it is.

545
00:38:14.375 --> 00:38:17.627
Magnesium chlorate. Can you believe it?

546
00:38:18.087 --> 00:38:19.254
DAPHNE:
Of course.

547
00:38:19.422 --> 00:38:22.132
Magnesium chlorate
is a highly-combustible substance...

548
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:26.803
...that can be used to create an explosion
identical to the third ghost's smoke screen.

549
00:38:27.722 --> 00:38:29.389
How did you--?

550
00:38:29.557 --> 00:38:32.726
-I can read upside down.
-That's great.

551
00:38:32.893 --> 00:38:36.521
But why would a ghost
need a smoke screen?

552
00:38:36.689 --> 00:38:38.982
Because maybe....

553
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:41.151
Maybe he's not a ghost at all.

554
00:38:41.319 --> 00:38:44.112
Remember, last night,
we thought we saw the third ghost...

555
00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:47.490
...it was just one of the Greek chorus
costumes from Julius Caesar.

556
00:38:47.658 --> 00:38:50.410
I guess that would explain
why there are only two graves...

557
00:38:50.578 --> 00:38:54.331
...but I still don't understand
how someone wearing a costume could fly.

558
00:38:54.498 --> 00:38:58.752
I do. The safety rigging. You know
that thing they use for gymnastics?

559
00:38:58.919 --> 00:39:02.922
When I was facing off against the ghost,
you know, head-to-head, football style.

560
00:39:03.549 --> 00:39:06.885
-Shake and bake and just a little stiff-arm.
-We get it.

561
00:39:07.053 --> 00:39:10.722
Right, well, I used the gymnastics harness
to escape.

562
00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:13.475
And I bet it sure looked like I was flying.

563
00:39:13.642 --> 00:39:15.769
Okay. So what we've deduced...

564
00:39:15.936 --> 00:39:19.564
...is that there's one sneaky human
working with two real ghosts.

565
00:39:19.732 --> 00:39:23.026
Exactly. Come on, this has to be enough
to clear our names.

566
00:39:26.489 --> 00:39:30.283
Principal Deedle, we have some
information about the ghosts.

567
00:39:30.451 --> 00:39:31.993

568
00:39:32.161 --> 00:39:35.246
What more information do we need
except that they want us to leave?

569
00:39:35.414 --> 00:39:39.125

to insist on the immediate closure of--

-Nonsense.
-What?

00:39:40.628 --> 00:39:45.382
I've got your ghosts right here.
I found these two in the freezer.

572
00:39:45.549 --> 00:39:47.967

SCOOBY:
I'm out of here.

574
00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:55.475
Which would've given them ample time
to do all this.

00:39:55.643 --> 00:39:57.519
What? Are you sure?

576
00:39:57.686 --> 00:40:00.939
Because this seems like an awful lot
of damage for a couple of--

577
00:40:01.107 --> 00:40:03.775
Principal Deedle,
I am more than familiar...

578
00:40:03.943 --> 00:40:06.152
...with the troublemaker's capacity
for damage.

579
00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:09.072
That is why you put me in charge
of discipline, remember?

580
00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:13.535
-Now, Vice Principal Grimes, I really don't--
-I will handle it, Principal Deedle.

00:40:15.371 --> 00:40:17.997
Vice Principal Grimes,
you have to believe me.

582
00:40:18.165 --> 00:40:20.583
We didn't do any of this.
It really was the ghosts.

583
00:40:20.751 --> 00:40:22.710
They locked us in the freezer.

584
00:40:22.878 --> 00:40:24.712
Oh, and they ate all the ice cream too.

585
00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:28.299
Right. More ghost stories.

586
00:40:28.467 --> 00:40:31.177
So do we have all of you
to thank for this?

587
00:40:31.345 --> 00:40:34.639

act alone this time?

would mitigate your punishment.

So was I.

is impressive nonetheless.
