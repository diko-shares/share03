00:09:52.692 --> 00:09:54.626
BUT IT'S LIGHT IN THERE.

185
00:09:54.694 --> 00:09:56.260
PLEASE.

186
00:10:20.219 --> 00:10:22.320
WHAT DO YOU DRINK, BOURBON?

187
00:10:22.388 --> 00:10:25.323
LOOK, MRS. ROBINSON,
I DROVE YOU HOME,

188
00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:26.991
I WAS GLAD TO DO IT,

189
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.493
BUT I HAVE SOME
THINGS ON MY MIND.

190
00:10:28.562 --> 00:10:29.828
CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

191
00:10:29.896 --> 00:10:30.829
YES.

192
00:10:30.897 --> 00:10:32.330
ALL RIGHT.

193
00:10:32.398 --> 00:10:34.332
WHAT DO YOU DRINK?

194
00:10:36.736 --> 00:10:38.714
BENJAMIN, I'M SORRY
TO BE THIS WAY,

195
00:10:38.738 --> 00:10:39.949
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO BE LEFT ALONE

196
00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:40.905
IN THIS HOUSE.

197
00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:41.906
WHY NOT?

198
00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:43.453
PLEASE WAIT TILL MY
HUSBAND GETS HOME.

199
00:10:43.477 --> 00:10:45.443
WHEN IS HE COMING BACK?

200
00:10:45.512 --> 00:10:47.144
I DON'T KNOW.

201
00:10:48.582 --> 00:10:49.514
DRINK?

202
00:10:49.583 --> 00:10:51.148
NO.

203
00:10:52.586 --> 00:10:55.353
ARE YOU ALWAYS THIS MUCH
AFRAID OF BEING ALONE?

204
00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:56.855
YES.

205
00:10:56.923 --> 00:10:58.623
WELL, WHY CAN'T YOU
JUST LOCK THE DOORS

206
00:10:58.692 --> 00:10:59.858
AND GO TO BED?

207
00:10:59.926 --> 00:11:03.127
I'M VERY NEUROTIC.

208
00:11:15.191 --> 00:11:17.626
MAY I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

209
00:11:17.694 --> 00:11:20.595
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ME?

210
00:11:20.664 --> 00:11:22.930
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

211
00:11:22.999 --> 00:11:24.644
YOU'VE KNOWN ME
NEARLY ALL YOUR LIFE.

212
00:11:24.668 --> 00:11:26.346
YOU MUST'VE FORMED
SOME OPINION OF ME.

213
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.070
WELL, I ALWAYS THOUGHT

214
00:11:29.139 --> 00:11:32.006
THAT YOU WERE A
VERY NICE PERSON.

215
00:11:33.777 --> 00:11:35.977
DID YOU KNOW I WAS AN ALCOHOLIC?

216
00:11:38.047 --> 00:11:39.414
WHAT?

217
00:11:39.483 --> 00:11:41.215
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

218
00:11:42.753 --> 00:11:45.153
LOOK, I THINK I SHOULD BE GOING.

219
00:11:45.221 --> 00:11:46.721
SIT DOWN, BENJAMIN.

220
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.524
MRS. ROBINSON, IF YOU
DON'T MIND MY SAYING SO,

221
00:11:49.593 --> 00:11:51.726
THIS CONVERSATION IS
GETTING A LITTLE STRANGE.

222
00:11:51.795 --> 00:11:54.228
NOW, I'M SURE MR. ROBINSON
WILL BE HERE ANY MINUTE...

223
00:11:54.298 --> 00:11:55.530
NO. WHAT?

224
00:11:55.599 --> 00:11:57.277
MY HUSBAND WILL
BE BACK QUITE LATE.

225
00:11:57.301 --> 00:11:59.901
HE SHOULD BE GONE
FOR SEVERAL HOURS.

226
00:12:01.204 --> 00:12:02.470
OH, MY GOD.

227
00:12:02.539 --> 00:12:03.805
PARDON?

228
00:12:03.873 --> 00:12:05.139
OH, NO, MRS. ROBINSON. OH, NO.

229
00:12:05.208 --> 00:12:06.474
WHAT'S WRONG?

230
00:12:06.543 --> 00:12:07.663
MRS. ROBINSON, YOU DIDN'T...

231
00:12:07.711 --> 00:12:10.978
I MEAN, YOU DIDN'T
EXPECT... WHAT?

232
00:12:11.047 --> 00:12:12.525
I MEAN, YOU DIDN'T REALLY THINK

233
00:12:12.549 --> 00:12:14.527
I'D DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

234
00:12:14.551 --> 00:12:15.650
LIKE WHAT?

235
00:12:15.719 --> 00:12:17.151
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

236
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:18.653
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

237
00:12:18.722 --> 00:12:20.988
FOR GOD'S SAKE, MRS. ROBINSON.

238
00:12:21.057 --> 00:12:23.991
HERE WE ARE. YOU GOT
ME INTO YOUR HOUSE,

239
00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.661
YOU GIVE ME A DRINK,
YOU PUT ON MUSIC,

240
00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.863
NOW YOU START OPENING
UP YOUR PERSONAL LIFE TO ME

241
00:12:28.932 --> 00:12:30.209
AND TELLING ME YOUR HUSBAND
WON'T BE HOME FOR HOURS.

242
00:12:30.233 --> 00:12:31.316
SO?

243
00:12:31.385 --> 00:12:34.669
MRS. ROBINSON, YOU'RE
TRYING TO SEDUCE ME.

244
00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.340
AREN'T YOU?

245
00:12:38.408 --> 00:12:41.509
WELL, NO, I HADN'T
THOUGHT OF IT.

246
00:12:41.578 --> 00:12:43.189
I FEEL VERY FLATTERED.

247
00:12:43.213 --> 00:12:45.012
WILL YOU FORGIVE ME
FOR WHAT I JUST SAID?

248
00:12:45.081 --> 00:12:46.514
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

249
00:12:46.583 --> 00:12:47.583
IT'S NOT ALL RIGHT.

250
00:12:47.617 --> 00:12:48.761
IT'S THE WORST THING I
EVER SAID TO ANYONE.

251
00:12:48.785 --> 00:12:50.184
SIT DOWN.

252
00:12:50.253 --> 00:12:53.020
PLEASE FORGIVE ME,
BECAUSE I LIKE YOU.

253
00:12:53.089 --> 00:12:54.856
I DON'T THINK OF YOU THAT WAY,

254
00:12:54.924 --> 00:12:56.023
BUT I'M MIXED UP.

255
00:12:56.092 --> 00:12:57.024
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
FINISH YOUR DRINK.

256
00:12:57.093 --> 00:12:59.394
IT MAKES ME SICK
THAT I SAID THAT TO YOU.

257
00:12:59.463 --> 00:13:02.630
FORGET IT RIGHT NOW.
FINISH YOUR DRINK.

258
00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:04.966
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?

259
00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:07.434
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
ELAINE'S PORTRAIT?

260
00:13:11.207 --> 00:13:12.474
WHA... HER PORTRAIT?

261
00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:13.475
YES.

262
00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:14.476
NO.

263
00:13:14.544 --> 00:13:16.021
WE HAD IT DONE LAST CHRISTMAS.

264
00:13:16.045 --> 00:13:17.523
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IT?

265
00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:19.113
VERY MUCH.

266
00:13:22.118 --> 00:13:24.318
IT'S HERE IN ELAINE'S ROOM.

267
00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:28.155
HMM.

268
00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:29.657
HMM.

269
00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:31.993
ELAINE CERTAINLY IS
AN ATTRACTIVE GIRL,

270
00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:33.294
ISN'T SHE?

271
00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:38.165
I DON'T REMEMBER HER
AS HAVING BROWN EYES.

272
00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:39.166
BENJAMIN.

273
00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:40.167
YES.

274
00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:42.214
WILL YOU COME
OVER HERE A MINUTE?

275
00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:43.549
OVER THERE? MM-HMM.

276
00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:44.806
SURE.

277
00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:51.724
WILL YOU UNZIP MY DRESS?

278
00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:54.181
I THINK I'LL GO TO BED.

279
00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:55.182
OH, WELL, GOOD NIGHT.

280
00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:57.229
WON'T YOU UNZIP MY DRESS?

281
00:13:57.253 --> 00:13:58.686
I'D RATHER NOT, MRS. ROBINSON.

282
00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:00.666
IF YOU STILL THINK I'M
TRYING TO SEDUCE YOU...

283
00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:02.624
NO, I DON'T, BUT I JUST
FEEL A LITTLE FUNNY.

284
00:14:02.692 --> 00:14:04.270
YOU'VE KNOWN ME ALL YOUR LIFE.

285
00:14:04.294 --> 00:14:05.226
I KNOW THAT, BUT I'M...

286
00:14:05.295 --> 00:14:08.296
COME ON, IT'S HARD
FOR ME TO REACH.

287
00:14:13.202 --> 00:14:14.736
THANK YOU.

288
00:14:14.805 --> 00:14:16.304
RIGHT.

289
00:14:16.372 --> 00:14:18.807
WHAT ARE YOU SO SCARED OF?

290
00:14:18.875 --> 00:14:20.809
I'M NOT SCARED, MRS. ROBINSON.

291
00:14:20.877 --> 00:14:22.472
THEN WHY DO YOU
KEEP RUNNING AWAY?

292
00:14:22.496 --> 00:14:23.645
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BED.

293
00:14:23.713 --> 00:14:25.413
I DON'T THINK I
SHOULD BE UP HERE.

294
00:14:25.482 --> 00:14:28.416
HAVEN'T YOU SEEN
ANYBODY IN A SLIP BEFORE?

295
00:14:28.485 --> 00:14:30.919
YES, I HAVE, BUT I JUST...

296
00:14:30.987 --> 00:14:33.421
LOOK, WHAT IF MR. ROBINSON
WALKED IN RIGHT NOW?

297
00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:34.422
WHAT IF HE DID?

298
00:14:34.491 --> 00:14:36.035
IT WOULD LOOK PRETTY
FUNNY, WOULDN'T IT?

299
00:14:36.059 --> 00:14:37.770
DON'T YOU THINK HE'D
TRUST US TOGETHER?

300
00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:38.827
OF COURSE, HE DOES,

301
00:14:38.895 --> 00:14:40.540
BUT HE MIGHT GET THE
WRONG IDEA. ANYONE MIGHT.

302
00:14:40.564 --> 00:14:42.542
I DON'T SEE WHY. I'M
TWICE AS OLD AS YOU.

303
00:14:42.566 --> 00:14:43.498
HOW COULD ANYONE THINK...

304
00:14:43.567 --> 00:14:45.500
THEY WOULD, DON'T YOU SEE?

305
00:14:45.569 --> 00:14:48.002
BENJAMIN, I AM NOT
TRYING TO SEDUCE YOU.

306
00:14:48.071 --> 00:14:50.404
I KNOW THAT, BUT PLEASE,
MRS. ROBINSON, THIS IS DIFFIC...

307
00:14:50.473 --> 00:14:52.740
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SEDUCE YOU?

308
00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:53.741
WHAT?

309
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.021
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO TELL ME?

310
00:14:56.045 --> 00:14:57.479
I'M GOING HOME NOW.

311
00:14:57.547 --> 00:14:59.013
I APOLOGIZE FOR WHAT I SAID.

312
00:14:59.082 --> 00:15:00.181
I HOPE YOU CAN FORGET IT,

313
00:15:00.249 --> 00:15:01.883
BUT I'M GOING HOME RIGHT NOW.

314
00:15:04.187 --> 00:15:05.252
BENJAMIN.

315
00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:06.321
YES?

316
00:15:06.356 --> 00:15:08.300
WILL YOU BRING UP MY
PURSE BEFORE YOU GO?

317
00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:09.791
I HAVE TO GO NOW. I'M SORRY.

318
00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.303
I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO PUT THIS ON AGAIN.

319
00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:12.338
WON'T YOU BRING IT UP?

320
00:15:12.362 --> 00:15:13.628
WHERE IS IT?

321
00:15:13.697 --> 00:15:15.937
ON THE TABLE IN THE HALL.

322
00:15:18.702 --> 00:15:20.134
MRS. ROBINSON?

323
00:15:20.203 --> 00:15:21.636
I'M IN THE BATHROOM.

324
00:15:21.705 --> 00:15:23.137
WELL, HERE'S THE PURSE.

325
00:15:23.206 --> 00:15:25.184
COULD YOU BRING IT UP?

326
00:15:25.208 --> 00:15:27.509
WELL, I'LL HAND IT TO YOU.

327
00:15:27.577 --> 00:15:28.688
COME TO THE RAILING,
AND I'LL HAND IT UP.

328
00:15:28.712 --> 00:15:30.979
BENJAMIN, I'M
GETTING PRETTY TIRED

329
00:15:31.047 --> 00:15:31.980
OF ALL THE SUSPICION.

330
00:15:32.048 --> 00:15:33.626
NOW, IF YOU WON'T
DO ME A SIMPLE FAVOR,

331
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.650
I DON'T KNOW WHAT.

332
00:15:35.719 --> 00:15:38.653
I'M PUTTING IT ON THE TOP STEP.

333
00:15:38.722 --> 00:15:40.032
FOR GOD'S SAKE, BENJAMIN,

334
00:15:40.056 --> 00:15:41.200
WILL YOU STOP ACTING THIS WAY

335
00:15:41.224 --> 00:15:43.384
AND BRING ME THE PURSE?

336
00:15:45.228 --> 00:15:47.662
I'M PUTTING IT HERE BY THE DOOR.

337
00:15:47.731 --> 00:15:49.709
WILL YOU BRING IT IN TO ME?

338
00:15:49.733 --> 00:15:51.165
I'D RATHER NOT.

339
00:15:51.234 --> 00:15:53.668
ALL RIGHT. PUT IT
IN ELAINE'S ROOM

340
00:15:53.737 --> 00:15:54.669
WHERE WE WERE.

341
00:15:54.738 --> 00:15:55.803
RIGHT.

342
00:16:06.349 --> 00:16:08.049
OH, GOD.

343
00:16:08.117 --> 00:16:09.551
OH, LET ME OUT.

344
00:16:09.619 --> 00:16:10.685
DON'T BE NERVOUS.

345
00:16:10.754 --> 00:16:11.686
GET AWAY FROM THAT DOOR.

346
00:16:11.755 --> 00:16:12.955
I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING FIRST.

347
00:16:13.006 --> 00:16:13.922
JESUS CHRIST.

348
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.923
BENJAMIN, I WANT YOU TO KNOW

349
00:16:14.991 --> 00:16:16.002
THAT I'M AVAILABLE TO YOU,

350
00:16:16.026 --> 00:16:17.253
AND IF YOU WON'T
SLEEP WITH ME THIS TIME...

351
00:16:17.277 --> 00:16:18.404
OH, MY CHRIST.

352
00:16:18.428 --> 00:16:19.605
IF YOU WON'T SLEEP
WITH ME THIS TIME,

353
00:16:19.629 --> 00:16:21.596
I WANT YOU TO KNOW YOU
CAN CALL ME UP ANYTIME,

354
00:16:21.665 --> 00:16:22.596
AND WE'LL MAKE SOME
KIND OF AN ARRANGEMENT.

355
00:16:22.682 --> 00:16:23.598
OH.

356
00:16:23.667 --> 00:16:25.144
DO YOU UNDERSTAND? LET ME OUT.

357
00:16:26.703 --> 00:16:28.414
UNDERSTAND? YES,
YES, LET ME OUT.

358
00:16:28.438 --> 00:16:30.237
I FIND YOU VERY ATTRACTIVE.

359
00:16:31.374 --> 00:16:33.814
OH, JESUS, THAT'S HIM!

360
00:16:43.386 --> 00:16:45.820
Mr. Robinson: IS THAT
BEN'S CAR IN FRONT?

361
00:16:45.889 --> 00:16:47.321
YES, SIR.

362
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:49.368
I DROVE MRS. ROBINSON HOME.

363
00:16:49.392 --> 00:16:52.326
SHE WANTED ME TO DRIVE HER HOME,

364
00:16:52.395 --> 00:16:54.328
SO I DROVE HER HOME.

365
00:16:54.397 --> 00:16:56.664
SWELL. I APPRECIATE IT.

366
00:16:56.733 --> 00:16:58.499
SHE'S UPSTAIRS.

367
00:16:58.568 --> 00:17:00.479
SHE WANTED ME TO WAIT DOWN HERE

368
00:17:00.503 --> 00:17:01.547
TILL YOU GOT HOME.

369
00:17:01.571 --> 00:17:04.438
STANDING GUARD OVER
THE OLD CASTLE, ARE YOU?

370
00:17:04.507 --> 00:17:06.074
YES, SIR.

371
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:09.443
HEY, CONGRATULATIONS.

372
00:17:09.512 --> 00:17:10.945
THANK YOU.

373
00:17:11.014 --> 00:17:13.447
LOOKS LIKE YOU NEED A REFILL.

374
00:17:13.516 --> 00:17:15.449
NO, I'VE GOT TO GO.

375
00:17:15.518 --> 00:17:17.118
IS ANYTHING WRONG?

376
00:17:17.186 --> 00:17:19.621
YOU LOOK A LITTLE SHAKEN UP.

377
00:17:19.689 --> 00:17:22.624
OH, NO, I'M JUST A LITTLE
WORRIED ABOUT MY FUTURE.

378
00:17:22.692 --> 00:17:25.627
I'M A LITTLE UPSET
ABOUT MY FUTURE.

379
00:17:25.695 --> 00:17:29.130
COME ON, LET'S HAVE
A NIGHTCAP TOGETHER.

380
00:17:29.198 --> 00:17:30.632
SCOTCH?

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.266
BOURBON.

382
00:17:34.704 --> 00:17:36.270
BEN...

383
00:17:37.707 --> 00:17:40.141
HOW OLD ARE YOU NOW?

384
00:17:40.209 --> 00:17:43.477
20. I'LL BE 21 NEXT WEEK.

385
00:17:53.723 --> 00:17:57.158
THAT'S A HELL OF
A GOOD AGE TO BE.

386
00:17:57.226 --> 00:17:58.793
THANK YOU.

387
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.070
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SIR.

388
00:18:10.173 --> 00:18:14.608
I, UH... I WISH I WAS

389
00:18:14.678 --> 00:18:17.745
BECAUSE, BEN... SIR?

390
00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:21.382
YOU'LL NEVER BE YOUNG AGAIN.

391
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:23.084
I KNOW.

392
00:18:30.694 --> 00:18:33.627
BEN, CAN I SAY SOMETHING TO YOU?

393
00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:35.096
WHAT?

394
00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:41.869
UH, HOW LONG HAVE WE
KNOWN EACH OTHER NOW?

395
00:18:41.938 --> 00:18:46.640
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
AND I KNOWN EACH OTHER?

396
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:51.312
HOW LONG HAVE YOUR
DAD AND I BEEN PARTNERS?

397
00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.014
QUITE A WHILE.

398
00:18:53.083 --> 00:18:54.193
HMM.

399
00:18:54.217 --> 00:18:55.482
HMM.

400
00:18:59.555 --> 00:19:01.923
I WATCHED YOU GROW UP, BEN.

401
00:19:01.991 --> 00:19:03.591
YES, SIR.

402
00:19:03.659 --> 00:19:06.928
IN MANY WAYS,

403
00:19:06.996 --> 00:19:09.075
I FEEL AS THOUGH
YOU WERE MY OWN SON.

404
00:19:09.099 --> 00:19:10.932
THANK YOU.

405
00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:17.105
SO I HOPE YOU WON'T MIND

FRIENDLY PIECE OF ADVICE.

407
00:19:22.011 --> 00:19:23.644
I'D LIKE TO HEAR IT.

408
00:19:28.017 --> 00:19:31.619
BEN... I THINK...

409
00:19:31.687 --> 00:19:34.622
I THINK YOU OUGHT

410
00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:36.624
A LITTLE EASIER RIGHT NOW

411
00:19:36.692 --> 00:19:37.937

412
00:19:37.961 --> 00:19:39.127
HMM.

00:19:41.197 --> 00:19:43.131
TAKE THINGS AS THEY COME.

415
00:19:43.199 --> 00:19:46.634
HAVE A GOOD TIME WITH
THE GIRLS AND SO FORTH.

416
00:19:46.702 --> 00:19:48.803
DON'T GET UP.

417
00:19:50.206 --> 00:19:54.642
I, UH... I WAS JUST
TELLING... BEN.

418
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:55.977

YOU THINK THAT'S SOUND ADVICE?

422
00:20:02.218 --> 00:20:03.651
YES, I DO.

423
00:20:03.719 --> 00:20:05.820
I'VE GOT TO GO.

424
00:20:07.223 --> 00:20:11.659

425
00:20:11.727 --> 00:20:14.662
I BET YOU'RE QUITE
A LADIES' MAN.

426
00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:15.997
OH, NO.

WHAT?

428
00:20:17.566 --> 00:20:19.544
YOU LOOK TO ME
LIKE THE KIND OF GUY

429
00:20:19.568 --> 00:20:21.502

430
00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:24.005
DOESN'T HE LOOK TO YOU

431
00:20:24.073 --> 00:20:25.717

YES, HE DOES.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:28.843
OH, SAY, UM...

ARE YOU READY IN THERE,
FEATURE ATTRACTION?

450
00:21:02.945 --> 00:21:05.346
Benjamin: COULD I SPEAK
TO YOU FOR A SECOND, DAD?

451
00:21:05.415 --> 00:21:08.549
LISTEN, I'M GOING TO ASK
FOR A BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE

452
00:21:08.618 --> 00:21:10.551
TO BRING THIS BOY

453
00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.421
NO, WAIT A MINUTE.
LET ME AMEND THAT.

454
00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:16.057
TO BRING THIS
YOUNG MAN OUT HERE,

455
00:21:16.126 --> 00:21:19.560
BECAUSE TODAY
HE IS 21 YEARS OLD.

456
00:21:19.629 --> 00:21:21.962
YEAH! LET'S GO! OUR FOOD'S COLD.

457
00:21:22.032 --> 00:21:23.109
OH, NOW JUST HANG ON A MINUTE,

458
00:21:23.133 --> 00:21:24.932
I'VE GOT A FEW WORDS TO SAY.

YOU ALWAYS DO.

460
00:21:26.503 --> 00:21:28.103
HO HO HO! LOOK WHO'S TALKING.

461
00:21:29.272 --> 00:21:30.782
Benjamin: DAD, CAN WE

463
00:21:31.807 --> 00:21:33.452
I CAN'T HOLD THEM
MUCH LONGER, BEN.

464
00:21:33.476 --> 00:21:34.409
YOU BETTER GET OUT HERE.

465
00:21:34.477 --> 00:21:36.210
I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS THIS.

466
00:21:36.279 --> 00:21:38.712

00:21:49.159 --> 00:21:50.636
YOU'RE DISAPPOINTING THEM, BEN.

471
00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.093
YOU'RE DISAPPOINTING THEM!

472
00:21:52.162 --> 00:21:53.594
Benjamin: DAD, CAN YOU LISTEN?

00:28:36.732 --> 00:28:37.831
OF COURSE.

545
00:28:37.899 --> 00:28:38.965
THANK YOU.

546
00:28:40.068 --> 00:28:41.501
HOW ARE YOU?

547
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:43.319
VERY WELL, THANK YOU.

548
00:28:46.875 --> 00:28:48.809
MAY I HAVE A DRINK?

549
00:28:48.877 --> 00:28:50.444
A DRINK? OF COURSE.

550
00:28:54.015 --> 00:28:55.449
HE DIDN'T SEE ME.

551
00:28:55.517 --> 00:28:56.450
WAITER.

552
00:28:56.518 --> 00:28:58.452
I WILL HAVE A MARTINI.

553
00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:59.760
YES, MA'AM.

554
00:29:01.824 --> 00:29:04.257
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
SO NERVOUS, YOU KNOW.

555
00:29:04.326 --> 00:29:06.760
NERVOUS? WELL, I
AM A BIT NERVOUS.

556
00:29:06.829 --> 00:29:09.763
I MEAN, IT'S PRETTY HARD
TO BE SUAVE WHEN YOU'RE...

557
00:29:09.832 --> 00:29:11.810
DID YOU GET US A ROOM?

558
00:29:11.834 --> 00:29:12.766
WHAT?

559
00:29:12.835 --> 00:29:14.813
HAVE YOU GOTTEN US A ROOM YET?

560
00:29:14.837 --> 00:29:16.269
I HAVEN'T, NO.

561
00:29:16.338 --> 00:29:17.771
DO YOU WANT TO?

562
00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.273
WELL, I DON'T...
I MEAN, I COULD.

563
00:29:20.342 --> 00:29:22.275
OR WE COULD JUST TALK.

564
00:29:22.344 --> 00:29:24.277
YOU WANT ME TO GET IT?

565
00:29:24.346 --> 00:29:25.645
NO, NO, I'LL GET IT.

566
00:29:25.714 --> 00:29:28.648
DO YOU WANT TO GET IT NOW?

567
00:29:28.717 --> 00:29:29.649
NOW?

568
00:29:29.718 --> 00:29:30.650
YES.

569
00:29:30.719 --> 00:29:32.151
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

570
00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.198
WHY DON'T YOU GET IT?

571
00:29:34.222 --> 00:29:36.155
WHY DON'T I GET IT?

572
00:29:36.224 --> 00:29:38.825
WELL, I WILL, THEN,
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

573
00:29:54.576 --> 00:29:55.776
EXCUSE ME.

574
00:29:57.613 --> 00:29:59.045
YES, SIR?

575
00:29:59.114 --> 00:30:02.048
A ROOM. I'D LIKE A ROOM, PLEASE.

576
00:30:02.117 --> 00:30:04.095
A SINGLE ROOM OR A DOUBLE ROOM?

577
00:30:04.119 --> 00:30:06.052
A SINGLE, JUST FOR
MYSELF, PLEASE.

578
00:30:06.121 --> 00:30:08.081
SIGN THE REGISTER, PLEASE.

579
00:30:12.394 --> 00:30:13.872
ANYTHING WRONG, SIR?

580
00:30:13.896 --> 00:30:15.662
WHAT? NO, NOTHING.

581
00:30:24.473 --> 00:30:27.808
DO YOU HAVE ANY
LUGGAGE, MR. GLADSTONE?

582
00:30:27.876 --> 00:30:28.809
LUGGAGE?

583
00:30:28.877 --> 00:30:30.310
YES, YES, I DO.

584
00:30:30.378 --> 00:30:31.812
WHERE IS IT?

585
00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:32.813
WHAT?

586
00:30:32.881 --> 00:30:34.314
WHERE IS YOUR LUGGAGE?

587
00:30:34.382 --> 00:30:36.817
IT'S IN THE CAR. IT'S
OUT THERE IN THE CAR.

588
00:30:36.885 --> 00:30:39.486
VERY GOOD, SIR. I'LL
HAVE A PORTER BRING IT IN.

589
00:30:39.555 --> 00:30:40.620
OH, NO.

590
00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:42.622
I MEAN, I'D...

591
00:30:42.691 --> 00:30:44.091
I'D RATHER NOT GO
TO ALL THE TROUBLE

592
00:30:44.125 --> 00:30:46.059
OF BRINGING IT ALL IN.

593
00:30:46.127 --> 00:30:48.061
I JUST HAVE A TOOTHBRUSH.

594
00:30:48.129 --> 00:30:49.607
I CAN GET IT MYSELF,
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

595
00:30:49.631 --> 00:30:50.564
OF COURSE.

596
00:30:50.632 --> 00:30:53.567
I'LL HAVE A PORTER
SHOW YOU THE ROOM.

597
00:30:53.635 --> 00:30:56.570
OH, WELL, ACTUALLY, I'D
JUST AS SOON FIND IT MYSELF.

598
00:30:56.638 --> 00:30:59.573
I JUST HAVE THE
TOOTHBRUSH TO CARRY UP.

599
00:30:59.641 --> 00:31:01.508
I CAN HANDLE IT MYSELF.

600
00:31:01.577 --> 00:31:03.009
WHATEVER YOU SAY, SIR.

601
00:31:03.078 --> 00:31:04.310
THANK YOU.

602
00:31:07.716 --> 00:31:08.982
MRS. ROBINSON?

603
00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:09.983
YES?

604
00:31:10.051 --> 00:31:11.518
FOR YOU.

605
00:31:11.587 --> 00:31:12.787
THANK YOU.

606
00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:18.792
HELLO.

607
00:31:18.861 --> 00:31:19.793
MRS. ROBINSON?

608
00:31:19.862 --> 00:31:20.794
YES?

609
00:31:20.863 --> 00:31:21.795
IT'S BENJAMIN.

610
00:31:21.864 --> 00:31:23.062
YES?

611
00:31:23.131 --> 00:31:24.498
BENJAMIN BRADDOCK.

612
00:31:25.467 --> 00:31:27.033
BENJAMIN, WHERE ARE YOU?

613
00:31:28.069 --> 00:31:30.670
CAN YOU LOOK THROUGH THE GLASS?

614
00:31:33.241 --> 00:31:35.174
CAN YOU SEE ME NOW?

615
00:31:35.243 --> 00:31:36.676
YES, I CAN.

616
00:31:36.745 --> 00:31:38.778
I GOT A SINGLE ROOM.

617
00:31:38.847 --> 00:31:39.779
THAT'S FINE.

618
00:31:39.848 --> 00:31:41.280
BUT THERE'S ONE THING...

619
00:31:41.349 --> 00:31:44.283
THE DESK CLERK SEEMED
TO BE A LITTLE BIT SUSPICIOUS.

620
00:31:44.352 --> 00:31:46.285
NOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE POLICY...

621
00:31:46.354 --> 00:31:47.532
DO YOU WANT TO GO UP FIRST?

622
00:31:47.556 --> 00:31:49.155
YES, I THINK THAT WOULD BE GOOD.

623
00:31:49.224 --> 00:31:51.035
I'LL BE UP IN 5 MINUTES.

624
00:31:51.059 --> 00:31:51.992
GOOD-BYE, THEN.

625
00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:52.993
BENJAMIN.

626
00:31:53.061 --> 00:31:54.160
YES?

627
00:31:54.229 --> 00:31:55.840
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO TELL ME?

628
00:31:55.864 --> 00:31:57.024
TELL YOU? YES.

629
00:31:57.065 --> 00:32:00.867
WELL, I WANT YOU TO KNOW
HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE THIS.

630
00:32:00.936 --> 00:32:01.868
REALLY.

631
00:32:01.937 --> 00:32:02.869
THE NUMBER.

632
00:32:02.938 --> 00:32:03.938
WHAT?

633
00:32:04.006 --> 00:32:05.617
THE ROOM NUMBER, BENJAMIN.

634
00:32:05.641 --> 00:32:06.985
I THINK YOU OUGHT
TO TELL ME THAT.

635
00:32:07.009 --> 00:32:08.542
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

636
00:32:10.078 --> 00:32:12.779
IT'S 568.

637
00:32:12.848 --> 00:32:14.180
THANK YOU.

638
00:32:14.249 --> 00:32:15.348
YOU'RE WELCOME.

639
00:32:16.284 --> 00:32:17.383
WELL...

640
00:32:18.353 --> 00:32:20.954
I'LL SEE YOU LATER,
MRS. ROBINSON.

641
00:32:28.564 --> 00:32:29.896
CHECK, PLEASE.

642
00:32:31.767 --> 00:32:33.533
I GOT IT. HMM?

643
00:32:33.602 --> 00:32:34.534
I SAY I GOT IT.

644
00:32:34.603 --> 00:32:35.535
SIR?

645
00:32:35.604 --> 00:32:36.781
THE TOOTHBRUSH.
I GOT IT, ALL RIGHT.

646
00:32:36.805 --> 00:32:38.004
VERY GOOD, SIR.

647
00:32:38.073 --> 00:32:39.751
YES. WELL, GOOD NIGHT.

648
00:32:39.775 --> 00:32:41.340
GOOD NIGHT, SIR.

649
00:34:32.638 --> 00:34:33.870
HELLO, BENJAMIN.

650
00:34:35.407 --> 00:34:37.487
HELLO, MRS. ROBINSON.

651
00:35:01.466 --> 00:35:02.532
AHEM.

652
00:35:10.142 --> 00:35:11.674
WELL.

653
00:35:11.743 --> 00:35:12.976
WELL.

654
00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:17.847
BENJAMIN... YES.

655
00:35:17.916 --> 00:35:19.060
I'LL GET UNDRESSED NOW.

656
00:35:19.084 --> 00:35:20.016
IS THAT ALL RIGHT?

657
00:35:20.085 --> 00:35:21.518
SURE.

658
00:35:21.587 --> 00:35:22.785
SHALL I...

659
00:35:22.854 --> 00:35:25.054
I MEAN, SHOULD I
JUST STAND HERE?

660
00:35:25.124 --> 00:35:26.634
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO.

661
00:35:26.658 --> 00:35:28.024
WHY DON'T YOU WATCH?

662
00:35:28.093 --> 00:35:29.292
OH, SURE. THANK YOU.

663
00:35:29.361 --> 00:35:31.339
WILL YOU BRING ME A HANGER?

664
00:35:31.363 --> 00:35:32.295
WHAT?

665
00:35:32.364 --> 00:35:33.296
A HANGER.

666
00:35:33.365 --> 00:35:34.431
OH, YES.

667
00:35:40.405 --> 00:35:41.538
WOOD?

668
00:35:41.607 --> 00:35:42.750
WHAT?

669
00:35:42.774 --> 00:35:45.208
WOOD OR WIRE? THEY HAVE BOTH.

670
00:35:45.277 --> 00:35:47.255
EITHER ONE WOULD BE FINE.

671
00:35:47.279 --> 00:35:48.512
OK.

672
00:35:57.556 --> 00:35:58.655
THANK YOU.

673
00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:07.830
WOULD YOU HELP
ME WITH THIS, PLEASE?

674
00:36:07.899 --> 00:36:08.965
CERTAINLY.

675
00:36:12.904 --> 00:36:13.836
THANK YOU.

676
00:36:13.905 --> 00:36:14.971
YOU'RE WELCOME.

677
00:36:33.692 --> 00:36:37.260
BENJAMIN, WOULD THIS BE
EASIER FOR YOU IN THE DARK?

678
00:36:37.329 --> 00:36:38.569
MRS. ROBINSON, I CAN'T DO THIS.

679
00:36:38.597 --> 00:36:39.529
YOU WHAT?

680
00:36:39.598 --> 00:36:40.763
THIS IS ALL TERRIBLY WRONG.

681
00:36:40.832 --> 00:36:42.743
DO YOU FIND ME UNDESIRABLE?

682
00:36:42.767 --> 00:36:44.033
OH, NO, MRS. ROBINSON.

683
00:36:44.102 --> 00:36:45.313
I THINK YOU'RE THE
MOST ATTRACTIVE

684
00:36:45.337 --> 00:36:47.270
OF ALL MY PARENTS' FRIENDS.

685
00:36:47.339 --> 00:36:48.650
I MEAN THAT. I FIND
YOU DESIRABLE,

686
00:36:48.674 --> 00:36:49.674
BUT I...

687
00:36:49.741 --> 00:36:51.474
FOR GOD'S SAKE, CAN
YOU IMAGINE MY PARENTS?

688
00:36:51.543 --> 00:36:52.654
CAN YOU IMAGINE
WHAT THEY WOULD SAY

689
00:36:52.678 --> 00:36:54.021
IF THEY JUST SAW US HERE
IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW?

690
00:36:54.045 --> 00:36:55.478
WHAT WOULD THEY SAY?

691
00:36:55.547 --> 00:36:58.481
I HAVE NO IDEA, MRS.
ROBINSON, BUT FOR GOD'S SAKE.

692
00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:00.617
THEY BROUGHT ME UP. THEY
MADE A GOOD LIFE FOR ME,

693
00:37:00.686 --> 00:37:02.519
AND I THINK THEY
DESERVE BETTER THAN THIS.

694
00:37:02.588 --> 00:37:03.665
I THINK THEY DESERVE
A LITTLE BETTER

695
00:37:03.689 --> 00:37:05.266
THAN JUMPING INTO BED
WITH THE PARTNER'S WIFE.

696
00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:06.956
ARE YOU AFRAID OF ME?

697
00:37:07.025 --> 00:37:08.325
OH, NO, YOU'RE
MISSING THE POINT.

698
00:37:08.393 --> 00:37:09.393
LOOK...

699
00:37:09.428 --> 00:37:12.229
MAYBE WE COULD DO
SOMETHING ELSE TOGETHER.

700
00:37:12.297 --> 00:37:15.565
MRS. ROBINSON, WOULD
YOU LIKE TO GO TO A MOVIE?

701
00:37:16.568 --> 00:37:19.269
CAN I ASK YOU A
PERSONAL QUESTION?

702
00:37:19.338 --> 00:37:20.570
ASK ME ANYTHING YOU WANT.

703
00:37:20.639 --> 00:37:22.517
IS THIS YOUR FIRST TIME?

704
00:37:22.541 --> 00:37:23.951
IS THIS WHAT? IT IS, ISN'T IT?

705
00:37:23.975 --> 00:37:25.353
IT IS YOUR FIRST TIME.

706
00:37:25.377 --> 00:37:26.309
THAT'S A LAUGH, MRS. ROBINSON.

707
00:37:26.378 --> 00:37:27.310
THAT'S REALLY A LAUGH.

708
00:37:27.379 --> 00:37:29.812
YOU CAN ADMIT THAT, CAN'T YOU?

709
00:37:29.881 --> 00:37:31.080
ARE YOU KIDDING?

710
00:37:31.149 --> 00:37:32.594
IT'S NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF.

711
00:37:32.618 --> 00:37:33.628
ON YOUR WAIT A
MINUTE. FIRST TIME...

712
00:37:33.652 --> 00:37:35.084
WHO SAID IT WAS MY FIRST TIME?

713
00:37:35.153 --> 00:37:38.087
JUST BECAUSE YOU
HAPPEN TO BE INADEQUATE.

714
00:37:38.156 --> 00:37:39.222
INADEQUATE?

715
00:37:42.461 --> 00:37:45.695
WELL, I GUESS I
BETTER... DON'T MOVE!

BEN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

770
00:42:48.683 --> 00:42:52.618
WELL, I WOULD SAY
THAT I'M JUST DRIFTING

771
00:42:52.687 --> 00:42:53.987
HERE IN THE POOL.

772
00:42:54.056 --> 00:42:55.121
WHY?

773
00:42:56.691 --> 00:42:58.169
WELL, IT'S VERY COMFORTABLE

774
00:42:58.193 --> 00:42:59.592
JUST TO DRIFT HERE.

775
00:42:59.661 --> 00:43:02.562
HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT GRADUATE SCHOOL?

776
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:04.064
NO.

777
00:43:04.132 --> 00:43:06.066
WOULD YOU MIND TELLING ME

778
00:43:06.134 --> 00:43:08.068
WHAT THOSE 4 YEARS
OF COLLEGE WERE FOR?

779
00:43:08.136 --> 00:43:09.647
WHAT WAS THE POINT
OF ALL THAT HARD WORK?

780
00:43:09.671 --> 00:43:11.571
YOU GOT ME.

781
00:43:11.639 --> 00:43:13.406
NOW, LISTEN, BEN...

782
00:43:15.643 --> 00:43:19.246
LOOK. I THINK IT'S
A VERY GOOD THING

783
00:43:19.314 --> 00:43:20.747
THAT A YOUNG MAN,

784
00:43:20.815 --> 00:43:23.250
AFTER HE'S DONE
SOME VERY GOOD WORK,

785
00:43:23.318 --> 00:43:26.253
SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE
TO RELAX AND ENJOY HIMSELF

786
00:43:26.321 --> 00:43:29.256
AND LIE AROUND AND
DRINK BEER AND SO ON.

787
00:43:29.324 --> 00:43:32.092
BUT AFTER A FEW WEEKS,

788
00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:35.262
I BELIEVE THAT PERSON WOULD
WANT TO TAKE SOME STOCK

789
00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:37.264
IN HIMSELF AND HIS SITUATION

790
00:43:37.332 --> 00:43:40.767
AND START TO THINK
ABOUT GETTING OFF HIS ASS.

791
00:43:40.835 --> 00:43:42.903
THE ROBINSONS ARE HERE.

792
00:43:44.806 --> 00:43:46.039
HI, BEN.

793
00:43:46.108 --> 00:43:48.674
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH YOURSELF THESE DAYS?

794
00:43:48.743 --> 00:43:51.111
OH, NOT TOO MUCH.

795
00:43:51.179 --> 00:43:52.879
TAKING IT EASY.

796
00:43:52.947 --> 00:43:54.948
THAT'S WHAT I'D DO IF I COULD.

797
00:43:55.017 --> 00:43:56.783
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.

798
00:43:56.851 --> 00:43:58.285
HEY, BEN...

799
00:43:58.353 --> 00:44:00.553
ELAINE'S COMING DOWN
FROM BERKELEY SOON.

800
00:44:00.622 --> 00:44:02.289
I WANT YOU TO CALL
HER UP THIS TIME.

801
00:44:02.357 --> 00:44:03.390
Ben: I WILL.

802
00:44:03.458 --> 00:44:04.991
BECAUSE I JUST THINK YOU TWO

803
00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:06.893
WOULD HIT IT OFF
REAL WELL TOGETHER.

804
00:44:06.962 --> 00:44:10.480
SAY HELLO TO MRS.
ROBINSON, BENJAMIN.

805
00:44:13.135 --> 00:44:15.201
HELLO, MRS. ROBINSON.

806
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:17.070
HELLO, BENJAMIN.

807
00:44:30.652 --> 00:44:31.584
OH, MY.

808
00:44:31.653 --> 00:44:32.585
HI.

809
00:44:32.654 --> 00:44:35.588
CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE?

810
00:44:35.657 --> 00:44:36.589
SURE.

811
00:44:36.658 --> 00:44:39.525
BENJY... DARLING,

812
00:44:39.594 --> 00:44:41.239
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU SOMETHING,

813
00:44:41.263 --> 00:44:43.141
BUT YOU... YOU DON'T
HAVE TO TELL ME

814
00:44:43.165 --> 00:44:44.931
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

815
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:45.932
WHAT?

816
00:44:46.001 --> 00:44:48.935
WELL, I'M GOING TO
ASK YOU WHAT YOU DO

817
00:44:49.004 --> 00:44:51.438
WHEN YOU GO OFF AT NIGHT.

818
00:44:51.506 --> 00:44:53.273
WHEN I GO OFF?

819
00:44:53.342 --> 00:44:55.320
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME

820
00:44:55.344 --> 00:44:56.654
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

821
00:44:56.678 --> 00:44:59.612
NO, I DO. I WANT TO TELL YOU.

822
00:44:59.681 --> 00:45:01.414
I DRIVE AROUND.

823
00:45:01.483 --> 00:45:03.549
WHAT ELSE?

824
00:45:03.618 --> 00:45:04.550
NOTHING ELSE.

825
00:45:04.619 --> 00:45:05.885
YOU DON'T DRIVE AROUND

826
00:45:05.954 --> 00:45:08.654
FROM MIDNIGHT UNTIL NOON
THE NEXT DAY, BENJAMIN.

827
00:45:08.723 --> 00:45:09.655
OH, NO.

828
00:45:09.724 --> 00:45:11.202
WELL, THEN, WHAT DO YOU DO?

829
00:45:11.226 --> 00:45:12.892
YOU MEET SOMEONE?

830
00:45:12.961 --> 00:45:13.893
MEET SOMEONE?

831
00:45:13.962 --> 00:45:15.862
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

832
00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:17.864
WELL, THIS IS YOUR BUSINESS.

833
00:45:17.932 --> 00:45:18.865
I WON'T PLAY GAMES WITH YOU.

834
00:45:18.933 --> 00:45:20.000
WAIT, WAIT.

835
00:45:20.068 --> 00:45:21.501
I DON'T MEET ANYONE, MOTHER,

836
00:45:21.569 --> 00:45:24.004
BUT WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

837
00:45:24.072 --> 00:45:26.806
BENJAMIN, I DON'T WANT
TO PRY INTO YOUR AFFAIRS,

838
00:45:26.875 --> 00:45:29.053
BUT I WOULD RATHER YOU
DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL

839
00:45:29.077 --> 00:45:30.310
THAN BE DISHONEST.

840
00:45:30.379 --> 00:45:31.311
GOOD NIGHT.

841
00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:34.014
WELL, WAIT... WAIT A MINUTE!

842
00:45:34.082 --> 00:45:36.682
WILL YOU WAIT A MINUTE, PLEASE?

843
00:45:38.653 --> 00:45:40.631
MRS. ROBINSON, DO YOU THINK

844
00:45:40.655 --> 00:45:43.089
WE COULD SAY A FEW WORDS

845
00:45:43.157 --> 00:45:45.592
TO EACH OTHER FIRST THIS TIME?

846
00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:50.262
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE
MUCH TO SAY TO EACH OTHER.

847
00:45:52.667 --> 00:45:53.600
LOOK, FOR MONTHS,

848
00:45:53.668 --> 00:45:55.935
ALL WE'VE DONE IS COME UP HERE

849
00:45:56.004 --> 00:45:58.104
AND LEAP INTO BED TOGETHER.

850
00:45:58.172 --> 00:46:00.106
ARE YOU TIRED OF IT?

851
00:46:00.174 --> 00:46:01.040
I'M NOT, NO.

852
00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:02.920
BUT DO YOU THINK
WE COULD LIVEN IT UP

853
00:46:02.944 --> 00:46:04.421
WITH A LITTLE
CONVERSATION FOR A CHANGE?

854
00:46:04.445 --> 00:46:06.880
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT?

855
00:46:06.948 --> 00:46:08.425
ANYTHING. ANYTHING AT ALL.

856
00:46:08.449 --> 00:46:10.383
DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME

857
00:46:10.451 --> 00:46:12.886
ABOUT SOME OF YOUR
COLLEGE EXPERIENCES?

858
00:46:12.954 --> 00:46:14.521
OH, MY GOD.

859
00:46:18.643 --> 00:46:20.242
THINK OF ANOTHER TOPIC.

860
00:46:29.821 --> 00:46:32.088
HOW ABOUT ART?

861
00:46:32.156 --> 00:46:33.968
ART. THAT'S A GOOD SUBJECT.

862
00:46:33.992 --> 00:46:35.424
YOU START IT OFF.

863
00:46:35.494 --> 00:46:36.926
YOU START IT OFF.

864
00:46:36.995 --> 00:46:38.761
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

865
00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:40.307
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT?

866
00:46:40.331 --> 00:46:41.642
ARE YOU INTERESTED
MORE IN MODERN ART

867
00:46:41.666 --> 00:46:43.099
OR IN CLASSICAL ART?

868
00:46:43.167 --> 00:46:44.100
NEITHER.

869
00:46:44.168 --> 00:46:45.480
YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED IN ART?

870
00:46:45.504 --> 00:46:46.435
NO.

871
00:46:46.505 --> 00:46:47.582
THEN WHY DO YOU
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

872
00:46:47.606 --> 00:46:48.671
I DON'T.

873
00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:50.017
NOW, LOOK, WE'RE
GOING TO DO THIS THING.

874
00:46:50.041 --> 00:46:51.986
WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE A CONVERSATION.

875
00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:54.443
TELL ME WHAT YOU DID TODAY.

876
00:46:54.513 --> 00:46:56.445
I GOT UP.

877
00:46:56.515 --> 00:46:57.446
OHH.

878
00:46:57.516 --> 00:46:59.949
I FIXED BREAKFAST
FOR MY HUSBAND.

879
00:47:00.018 --> 00:47:01.529
THERE. THERE'S SOMETHING

880
00:47:01.553 --> 00:47:02.930
WE COULD HAVE A
CONVERSATION ABOUT...

881
00:47:02.954 --> 00:47:04.220
YOUR HUSBAND.

882
00:47:04.288 --> 00:47:05.889
OH. HIM.

883
00:47:05.957 --> 00:47:07.390
I MEAN, EVERYTHING.

884
00:47:07.458 --> 00:47:09.436
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT HOW YOU WORK THIS.

885
00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:11.360
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO HIM

886
00:47:11.429 --> 00:47:12.440
WHEN YOU LEAVE
THE HOUSE AT NIGHT?

887
00:47:12.464 --> 00:47:13.896
NOTHING. HE'S ASLEEP.

888
00:47:13.965 --> 00:47:14.897
ALWAYS?

889
00:47:14.966 --> 00:47:17.900
DOESN'T HE WAKE UP
WHEN YOU COME HOME?

890
00:47:19.721 --> 00:47:20.886
WE HAVE SEPARATE BEDROOMS.

891
00:47:20.956 --> 00:47:22.555
OH, I SEE.

892
00:47:22.623 --> 00:47:24.574
SO YOU DON'T...

893
00:47:24.642 --> 00:47:27.410
I DON'T LIKE TO
SEEM LIKE I'M PRYING,

894
00:47:27.479 --> 00:47:29.456
BUT I GUESS YOU
DON'T SLEEP TOGETHER.

895
00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:30.914
NO, WE DON'T.

896
00:47:30.982 --> 00:47:33.399
HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN GOING ON?

897
00:47:33.468 --> 00:47:34.901
FOR GOD'S SAKE, LET'S DROP THIS.

898
00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:36.948
WAIT A MINUTE. WHY
DID YOU MARRY HIM?

899
00:47:36.972 --> 00:47:38.905
SEE IF YOU CAN GUESS.

900
00:47:38.974 --> 00:47:40.406
WELL, I CAN'T.

901
00:47:40.475 --> 00:47:42.575
THINK REAL HARD, BENJAMIN.

902
00:47:42.644 --> 00:47:45.578
I CAN'T SEE WHY
YOU DID, UNLESS...

903
00:47:56.657 --> 00:47:58.090
DON'T TELL ELAINE.

904
00:47:58.159 --> 00:47:59.091
OH, NO.

905
00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:00.525
YOU HAD TO MARRY HIM

906
00:48:00.594 --> 00:48:02.072
BECAUSE YOU GOT PREGNANT.

907
00:48:02.096 --> 00:48:03.662
ARE YOU SHOCKED?

908
00:48:05.099 --> 00:48:06.709
I NEVER THOUGHT OF
YOU AND MR. ROBINSON

909
00:48:06.733 --> 00:48:09.367
AS THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO...

910
00:48:09.436 --> 00:48:10.716
ALL RIGHT NOW, LET'S GET TO BED.

911
00:48:10.771 --> 00:48:13.205
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.

912
00:48:13.274 --> 00:48:15.207
SO HOW DID IT HAPPEN?

913
00:48:15.276 --> 00:48:16.208
WHAT?

914
00:48:16.277 --> 00:48:17.709
YOU AND MR. ROBINSON.

915
00:48:17.778 --> 00:48:19.211
DO YOU FEEL LIKE

916
00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:20.757
TELLING ME WHAT WERE
THE CIRCUMSTANCES?

917
00:48:20.781 --> 00:48:22.547
NOT PARTICULARLY.

918
00:48:22.616 --> 00:48:25.550
WAS HE A LAW
STUDENT AT THE TIME?

919
00:48:25.619 --> 00:48:26.551
MM-HMM.

920
00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:28.615
AND YOU WERE A STUDENT ALSO?

921
00:48:28.639 --> 00:48:29.704
MM-HMM.

922
00:48:30.641 --> 00:48:32.074
AT COLLEGE?

923
00:48:32.143 --> 00:48:33.075
YES.

924
00:48:33.144 --> 00:48:36.245
WHAT WAS YOUR MAJOR?

925
00:48:40.084 --> 00:48:41.183
BENJAMIN,

926
00:48:41.252 --> 00:48:43.585
WHY ARE YOU ASKING
ME ALL THESE QUESTIONS?

927
00:48:43.654 --> 00:48:45.632
BECAUSE I'M INTERESTED,
MRS. ROBINSON.

928
00:48:45.656 --> 00:48:48.757
WHAT WAS YOUR MAJOR
SUBJECT AT COLLEGE?

929
00:48:50.661 --> 00:48:51.593
ART.

930
00:48:51.662 --> 00:48:52.727
ART?

931
00:48:55.166 --> 00:48:56.731
BUT I THOUGHT YOU...

932
00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:00.670
HMM.

933
00:49:01.672 --> 00:49:05.040
I GUESS YOU KIND OF
LOST INTEREST IN IT

934
00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:06.586
OVER THE YEARS, THEN.

935
00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:08.177
KIND OF.

936
00:49:10.614 --> 00:49:13.215
WELL, HOW DID IT HAPPEN?

937
00:49:13.284 --> 00:49:14.216
WHAT?

938
00:49:14.285 --> 00:49:15.717
YOU AND MR. ROBINSON.

939
00:49:15.786 --> 00:49:17.219
HOW DO YOU THINK?

940
00:49:17.288 --> 00:49:19.955
DID YOU TAKE YOU UP
TO HIS ROOM WITH HIM?

941
00:49:20.024 --> 00:49:21.723
DID YOU GO TO A HOTEL?

942
00:49:21.792 --> 00:49:23.558
OH, BENJAMIN, WHAT
DOES IT POSSIBLY MATTER?

943
00:49:23.627 --> 00:49:24.559
I'M CURIOUS.

944
00:49:24.628 --> 00:49:26.561
WE'D GO TO HIS CAR.

945
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:27.562
OH, NO.

946
00:49:27.631 --> 00:49:30.065
IN THE CAR YOU DID IT?

947
00:49:30.134 --> 00:49:32.067
WELL, I DON'T THINK
WE WERE THE FIRST.

948
00:49:32.136 --> 00:49:34.736
WHAT KIND OF CAR WAS IT?

949
00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:37.072
WHAT?

950
00:49:37.141 --> 00:49:40.075
DO YOU REMEMBER
THE MAKE OF THE CAR?

951
00:49:40.144 --> 00:49:41.076
OH, MY GOD.

952
00:49:41.145 --> 00:49:42.744
REALLY, I WANT TO KNOW.

953
00:49:42.813 --> 00:49:44.246
IT WAS A FORD, BENJAMIN.

954
00:49:44.315 --> 00:49:46.915
A FORD.

955
00:49:46.984 --> 00:49:47.916
A FORD.

956
00:49:47.985 --> 00:49:50.266
GOD DAMN IT, THAT'S GREAT.

957
00:49:50.321 --> 00:49:51.419
A FORD.

958
00:49:51.488 --> 00:49:53.055
THAT'S ENOUGH.

959
00:49:56.660 --> 00:50:00.595
SO OLD ELAINE ROBINSON
GOT STARTED IN A FORD.

960
00:50:00.664 --> 00:50:03.098
DON'T TALK ABOUT ELAINE.

961
00:50:03.167 --> 00:50:05.600
DON'T TALK ABOUT ELAINE?

962
00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:06.735
NO.

963
00:50:07.671 --> 00:50:08.603
WHY NOT?

964
00:50:08.672 --> 00:50:11.106
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU TO.

965
00:50:11.175 --> 00:50:12.607
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU?

966
00:50:12.676 --> 00:50:14.609
I WISH YOU'D TELL ME.

967
00:50:14.678 --> 00:50:16.111
THERE'S NOTHING TO TELL.

968
00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:18.413
WELL, WHY IS SHE A
BIG TABOO SUBJECT

969
00:50:18.482 --> 00:50:20.048
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

970
00:50:20.117 --> 00:50:22.984
WELL, I GUESS I'LL HAVE
TO ASK HER OUT ON A DATE

971
00:50:23.053 --> 00:50:24.531
AND FIND OUT WHAT
THE BIG DEAL IS.

972
00:50:24.555 --> 00:50:28.623
BENJAMIN, DON'T YOU<i>
EVER</i> TAKE THAT GIRL OUT.

973
00:50:28.692 --> 00:50:30.124
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

974
00:50:30.193 --> 00:50:33.278
I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF TAKING HER OUT.

975
00:50:35.182 --> 00:50:36.615
GOOD.

976
00:50:36.684 --> 00:50:39.117
I WAS JUST KIDDING AROUND.

977
00:50:41.855 --> 00:50:42.921
GOOD.

978
00:50:44.692 --> 00:50:46.257
WELL, WHY SHOULDN'T I?

979
00:50:50.197 --> 00:50:51.630
I HAVE MY REASONS.

980
00:50:51.699 --> 00:50:52.931
THEN LET'S HEAR THEM.

981
00:50:52.999 --> 00:50:53.932
NO.

982
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:54.933
LET'S HEAR THEM, MRS. ROBINSON,

983
00:50:55.001 --> 00:50:56.813
BECAUSE I THINK I
KNOW WHAT THEY ARE.

984
00:50:56.837 --> 00:50:59.638
I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR
HER TO ASSOCIATE WITH, AM I?

985
00:50:59.707 --> 00:51:01.918
I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO
EVEN TALK ABOUT HER, AM I?

986
00:51:01.942 --> 00:51:02.874
LET'S DROP IT.

987
00:51:02.943 --> 00:51:04.053
WE'RE NOT DROPPING IT.

988
00:51:04.077 --> 00:51:05.522
I'M GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU,
BUT I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH

989
00:51:05.546 --> 00:51:06.723
TO ASSOCIATE WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.

990
00:51:06.747 --> 00:51:07.679
BENJAMIN.

991
00:51:07.748 --> 00:51:09.481
ISN'T IT?

992
00:51:22.496 --> 00:51:23.862
YES.

993
00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:25.597
YOU GO TO HELL.

994
00:51:25.666 --> 00:51:27.932
YOU GO STRAIGHT TO
HELL, MRS. ROBINSON.

995
00:51:28.001 --> 00:51:29.245
DO YOU THINK I'M
PROUD OF MYSELF?

996
00:51:29.269 --> 00:51:30.480
DO YOU THINK I'M PROUD OF THIS?

997
00:51:30.504 --> 00:51:31.936
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

998
00:51:32.005 --> 00:51:32.937
WELL, I AM NOT.

999
00:51:33.006 --> 00:51:33.938
NO, SIR.

1000
00:51:34.007 --> 00:51:36.941
I'M NOT PROUD
THAT I SPEND MY TIME

1001
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:38.488
WITH A BROKEN-DOWN ALCOHOLIC.

1002
00:51:38.512 --> 00:51:39.611
I SEE.

1003
00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:41.880
IF YOU THINK I COME HERE

1004
00:51:41.948 --> 00:51:43.259
FOR ANY REASON
BESIDES PURE BOREDOM,

1005
00:51:43.283 --> 00:51:44.215
THAN YOU'RE ALL WRONG.

1006
00:51:44.284 --> 00:51:45.617
'CAUSE, MRS. ROBINSON,

1007
00:51:45.686 --> 00:51:47.497
THIS IS THE SICKEST,
MOST PERVERTED THING

1008
00:51:47.521 --> 00:51:48.798
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

1009
00:51:48.822 --> 00:51:49.932
YOU DO WHAT YOU WANT,

1010
00:51:49.956 --> 00:51:51.668
BUT I'M GETTING THE HELL OUT.

1011
00:51:51.692 --> 00:51:52.624
ARE YOU?

1012
00:51:52.693 --> 00:51:54.259
GODDAMN RIGHT, I AM.

1013
00:51:56.697 --> 00:51:58.897
THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT ME?

1014
00:51:58.965 --> 00:52:00.565
THAT I'M A SICK AND
DISGUSTING PERSON?

1015
00:52:00.634 --> 00:52:02.066
NOW, DON'T START THIS.

1016
00:52:02.135 --> 00:52:03.067
WHAT?

1017
00:52:03.136 --> 00:52:04.569
DON'T START ACTING HURT.

1018
00:52:04.638 --> 00:52:07.572
DON'T YOU EXPECT ME
TO BE A LITTLE HURT?

1019
00:52:07.641 --> 00:52:09.574
MRS. ROBINSON, YOU
LIE THERE AND TELL ME

1020
00:52:09.643 --> 00:52:11.621
I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER.

1021
00:52:11.645 --> 00:52:13.077
DID I SAY THAT?

1022
00:52:13.146 --> 00:52:15.079
IN SO MANY WORDS.

1023
00:52:16.149 --> 00:52:18.650
BENJAMIN, I WANT
TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU

1024
00:52:18.719 --> 00:52:20.084
IF THAT'S THE
IMPRESSION YOU GOT.

1025
00:52:20.153 --> 00:52:21.964
WELL, 2 MINUTES AGO YOU TOLD ME

1026
00:52:21.988 --> 00:52:23.533
I WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER.

1027
00:52:23.557 --> 00:52:25.635
NOW YOU SAY YOU'RE
SORRY I GOT THAT IMPRESSION.

1028
00:52:25.659 --> 00:52:27.091
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

1029
00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:30.595
I DON'T THINK YOU'D BE
RIGHT FOR EACH OTHER.

1030
00:52:30.664 --> 00:52:34.599
I'D NEVER SAY YOU AREN'T
AS GOOD A PERSON AS SHE IS.

1031
00:52:34.668 --> 00:52:35.828
YOU WOULDN'T?

1032
00:52:37.003 --> 00:52:38.770
OF COURSE I WOULDN'T.

1033
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:44.943
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1034
00:52:45.011 --> 00:52:46.445
WELL, IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS

1035
00:52:46.513 --> 00:52:49.614
YOU DON'T WANT ME
AROUND ANYMORE.

1036
00:52:50.684 --> 00:52:52.451
WELL, LOOK, UH...

1037
00:52:55.188 --> 00:52:57.622
I WAS KIND OF UPSET THERE.

1038
00:52:57.691 --> 00:53:00.224
I'M SORRY I SAID THOSE THINGS.

1039
00:53:00.293 --> 00:53:01.726
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1040
00:53:01.795 --> 00:53:03.728
I THINK I CAN UNDERSTAND

1041
00:53:03.797 --> 00:53:06.230
WHY I'M DISGUSTING TO YOU.

1042
00:53:06.299 --> 00:53:07.699
OH, NO.

1043
00:53:08.802 --> 00:53:10.234
LOOK, I LIKE YOU.

1044
00:53:10.303 --> 00:53:12.303
I WOULDN'T KEEP COMING HERE

1045
00:53:12.372 --> 00:53:13.572
IF I DIDN'T LIKE YOU.

1046
00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.974
BUT IF IT'S SICKENING FOR YOU?

1047
00:53:16.042 --> 00:53:17.175
IT'S NOT.

1048
00:53:19.312 --> 00:53:22.246
I ENJOY IT. I LOOK
FORWARD TO IT.

1049
00:53:22.315 --> 00:53:24.583
IT'S THE ONE THING I HAVE

1050
00:53:24.651 --> 00:53:26.250
TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

1051
00:53:26.319 --> 00:53:28.419
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY THAT.

1052
00:53:28.489 --> 00:53:30.021
WELL, I WOULDN'T.

1053
00:53:30.090 --> 00:53:32.591
I WOULD NEVER SAY
IT IF IT WASN'T TRUE.

1054
00:53:32.659 --> 00:53:34.759
MAY I STAY, THEN?

1055
00:53:37.664 --> 00:53:40.599
YES, PLEASE. I WANT YOU TO.

1056
00:53:40.667 --> 00:53:41.766
THANK YOU.

1057
00:53:41.835 --> 00:53:45.269
WELL, DON'T THANK ME,
BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO.

1058
00:53:46.673 --> 00:53:49.608
BUT YOU WON'T EVER
TAKE ELAINE OUT, WILL YOU?

1059
00:53:49.676 --> 00:53:51.042
I WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME THAT.

1060
00:53:51.111 --> 00:53:53.879
LOOK, WHY THE HELL
DID YOU BRING THIS UP?

1061
00:53:53.947 --> 00:53:55.658
IT NEVER OCCURRED
TO ME TO TAKE HER OUT.

1062
00:53:55.682 --> 00:53:58.617
THEN GIVE ME YOUR
WORD YOU WON'T!

1063
00:53:58.685 --> 00:54:00.118
THIS IS ABSURD.

1064
00:54:00.186 --> 00:54:01.853
PROMISE ME, BENJAMIN.

1065
00:54:03.123 --> 00:54:04.556
ALL RIGHT, I PROMISE.

1066
00:54:04.625 --> 00:54:06.558
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, I PROMISE

1067
00:54:06.627 --> 00:54:09.227
I'LL NEVER TAKE OUT
ELAINE ROBINSON.

1068
00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:11.696
THANK YOU.

1069
00:54:16.803 --> 00:54:19.971
BENJAMIN... LET'S
NOT TALK ABOUT IT.

1070
00:54:20.874 --> 00:54:22.974
LET'S NOT TALK AT ALL.

1071
00:54:58.712 --> 00:55:00.290
ELAINE'S BACK FROM SCHOOL.

1072
00:55:00.314 --> 00:55:03.249
I THINK IT MIGHT
BE A NICE GESTURE

1073
00:55:03.317 --> 00:55:05.418
IF YOU ASKED HER OUT.

1074
00:55:18.433 --> 00:55:20.299
I SUPPOSE SHE'S NOT
GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU,

1075
00:55:20.368 --> 00:55:21.400
IS THAT IT?

1076
00:55:21.469 --> 00:55:23.447
LOOK, ELAINE ROBINSON
AND I DO NOT GET ALONG.

1077
00:55:23.471 --> 00:55:24.548
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

1078
00:55:24.572 --> 00:55:26.550
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
HER SINCE HIGH SCHOOL.

1079
00:55:26.574 --> 00:55:27.506
I SUPPOSE YOUR EVENINGS,

1080
00:55:27.575 --> 00:55:29.053
WHATEVER YOU DO WITH THEM,

1081
00:55:29.077 --> 00:55:30.554
ARE JUST TOO VALUABLE.

1082
00:55:30.578 --> 00:55:33.045
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

1083
00:55:33.114 --> 00:55:34.991
I GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE
TO TELL MR. ROBINSON

1084
00:55:35.015 --> 00:55:37.283
THAT YOU'RE TOO
BUSY EVERY EVENING

1085
00:55:37.351 --> 00:55:38.784
DOING GOD KNOWS WHAT.

1086
00:55:38.852 --> 00:55:41.287
NOW DON'T GO ON LIKE THIS.

1087
00:55:41.355 --> 00:55:42.832
IF BENJAMIN ABSOLUTELY REFUSES

1088
00:55:42.856 --> 00:55:45.291
TO TAKE HER OUT... I DO.

1089
00:55:45.359 --> 00:55:48.127
THEN I WILL SIMPLY
HAVE TO INVITE

1090
00:55:48.196 --> 00:55:50.796
ALL THE ROBINSONS
OVER ON THURSDAY.

1091
00:56:02.343 --> 00:56:03.353
Mr. Robinson: WELL, BRADDOCK,

1092
00:56:03.377 --> 00:56:06.312
IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU
GOT AROUND TO THIS.

1093
00:56:07.715 --> 00:56:09.126
Bob Eubanks: YOUR WIFE
PREDICTED YOU WOULD SAY WHAT?

1094
00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:10.082
PATTY DUVALLE.

1095
00:56:10.151 --> 00:56:11.151
Patty: OHH.

1096
00:56:14.155 --> 00:56:16.589
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT'S WHAT YOU...

1097
00:56:16.657 --> 00:56:18.090
NO POINTS. RIGHT?

1098
00:56:18.159 --> 00:56:20.392
HERE'S THE NEXT
QUESTION. GENTLEMEN...

1099
00:56:20.461 --> 00:56:21.960
HELLO.

1100
00:56:22.029 --> 00:56:24.330
WHAT IS YOUR WIFE'S
MOST UNUSUAL HABIT?

1101
00:56:24.398 --> 00:56:26.265
BEN, COME ON IN.

1102
00:56:26.334 --> 00:56:27.944
I'M AFRAID THE YOUNG LADY

1103
00:56:27.968 --> 00:56:30.736
ISN'T QUITE READY YET.

1104
00:56:30.804 --> 00:56:32.782
WHAT WOULD YOU
SAY TO A SHORT ONE?

1105
00:56:32.806 --> 00:56:34.118
SCOTCH STILL YOUR DRINK?

1106
00:56:34.142 --> 00:56:35.307
BOURBON.

1107
00:56:35.376 --> 00:56:38.310
Eubanks: CAN YOU THINK OF
SOMETHING THAT BOTHERS YOU?

1108
00:56:40.681 --> 00:56:42.114
Man: NOT SHAVING HER LEGS.

1109
00:56:46.354 --> 00:56:47.753
Woman: GOD.

1110
00:56:51.192 --> 00:56:53.792
WELL, I'LL SEE IF SHE'S READY.

1111
00:56:59.867 --> 00:57:01.367
Man: SORRY, HONEY, I...

1112
00:57:03.937 --> 00:57:05.904
LISTEN, THIS WAS NOT MY IDEA.

1113
00:57:05.973 --> 00:57:07.873
THIS WAS MY FATHER'S IDEA.

1114
00:57:07.941 --> 00:57:09.353
BENJAMIN, I THOUGHT
I MADE MYSELF

1115
00:57:09.377 --> 00:57:11.054
PERFECTLY CLEAR ABOUT THIS.

1116
00:57:11.078 --> 00:57:12.856
LOOK, WE'LL GO OUT TO
DINNER AND HAVE A DRINK,

1117
00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:14.057
AND I'LL BRING HER RIGHT BACK.

1118
00:57:14.081 --> 00:57:15.514
BECAUSE IT WAS EITHER THAT

1119
00:57:15.583 --> 00:57:17.583
OR A DINNER PARTY
FOR THE 2 FAMILIES.

1120
00:57:17.652 --> 00:57:19.062
AND I'M AFRAID I COULDN'T
QUITE HANDLE THAT,

1121
00:57:19.086 --> 00:57:21.520
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

1122
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:22.754
LOOK, I HAVE NO INTENTION

1123
00:57:22.823 --> 00:57:25.391
OF EVER TAKING YOUR
PRECIOUS DAUGHTER OUT AGAIN,

1124
00:57:25.459 --> 00:57:26.892
SO DON'T GET UPSET ABOUT IT.

1125
00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:28.294
I AM.

1126
00:57:28.362 --> 00:57:31.597
I'M EXTREMELY UPSET
ABOUT IT, BENJAMIN.

1127
00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:33.799
HELLO.

1128
00:57:34.868 --> 00:57:35.908
HELLO.

1129
00:57:35.969 --> 00:57:37.447
Mr. Robinson: I WANT
YOU TO KEEP YOUR WITS

1130
00:57:37.471 --> 00:57:38.404
ABOUT YOU TONIGHT.

1131
00:57:38.472 --> 00:57:41.307
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT
TRICKS BEN PICKED UP

1132
00:57:41.375 --> 00:57:43.475
BACK THERE IN THE EAST.

1133
00:57:53.187 --> 00:57:56.121
YOU'RE LIVING AT HOME
NOW, IS THAT RIGHT?

1134
00:57:56.190 --> 00:57:57.423
YES.

1135
00:57:58.526 --> 00:58:00.437
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO DO?

1136
00:58:00.461 --> 00:58:01.527
NO.

1137
00:58:04.798 --> 00:58:07.399
ARE YOU GOING TO
GRADUATE SCHOOL?

1138
00:58:07.468 --> 00:58:08.534
NO.

1139
00:58:14.141 --> 00:58:16.581
DO YOU ALWAYS DRIVE LIKE THIS?

1140
00:58:16.644 --> 00:58:17.909
YES.

1141
00:59:42.096 --> 00:59:43.328
SIT DOWN.

1142
00:59:58.446 --> 01:00:01.046
WHY DON'T YOU WATCH THE SHOW?

1143
01:00:04.117 --> 01:00:05.050
BENJAMIN,

1144
01:00:05.118 --> 01:00:07.399
DO YOU DISLIKE ME
FOR SOME REASON?

1145
01:00:07.455 --> 01:00:09.421
NO. WHY SHOULD I?

1146
01:00:10.791 --> 01:00:12.358
I DON'T KNOW.

1147
01:00:20.568 --> 01:00:23.235
YOU'RE MISSING A
GREAT EFFECT HERE.

1148
01:00:24.572 --> 01:00:25.838
GO, GO!

1149
01:00:25.906 --> 01:00:28.006
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?

1150
01:00:31.078 --> 01:00:32.644
COULD YOU DO IT?

1151
01:00:36.083 --> 01:00:37.883
GO, BABY, GO!

1152
01:00:55.269 --> 01:00:56.435
STOP!

1153
01:00:56.504 --> 01:00:57.603
HEY!

1154
01:00:57.671 --> 01:00:58.854
BOO!

1155
01:00:58.906 --> 01:01:00.506
BOO! BOO!

1156
01:01:06.947 --> 01:01:08.514
ELAINE, I'M SORRY.

1157
01:01:09.450 --> 01:01:11.049
ELAINE.

1158
01:01:11.118 --> 01:01:13.585
WOULD YOU TAKE ME HOME NOW?

1159
01:01:13.654 --> 01:01:16.555
I'M SORRY I TOOK YOU IN THERE.

1160
01:01:16.624 --> 01:01:19.184
I THINK I BETTER
GO HOME, PLEASE.

1161
01:01:22.396 --> 01:01:23.495
ELAINE.

1162
01:01:23.564 --> 01:01:24.996
WHERE'S THE CAR?

1163
01:01:25.065 --> 01:01:27.666
I JUST WANT TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

1164
01:01:30.571 --> 01:01:32.003
I WANT TO GO HOME.

1165
01:01:32.072 --> 01:01:35.006
CAN I JUST TELL
YOU THIS ONE THING?

1166
01:01:35.075 --> 01:01:36.174
WHAT?

1167
01:01:36.243 --> 01:01:37.954
THIS WHOLE IDEA... THIS
DATE AND EVERYTHING,

1168
01:01:37.978 --> 01:01:39.222
IT WAS MY PARENTS' IDEA.

1169
01:01:39.246 --> 01:01:41.179
THEY FORCED ME INTO IT.

1170
01:01:41.248 --> 01:01:44.182
THAT'S VERY NICE
OF YOU TO TELL ME.

1171
01:01:44.251 --> 01:01:45.929
WHAT I MEAN IS, THAT'S WHY
I'VE BEEN ACTING THIS WAY.

1172
01:01:45.953 --> 01:01:47.052
I'M NOT LIKE THIS.

1173
01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:49.220
I HATE MYSELF LIKE THIS.

1174
01:01:52.426 --> 01:01:55.360
LISTEN, COULD YOU JUST
STOP CRYING, PLEASE?

1175
01:01:55.429 --> 01:01:56.862
NO, I COULDN'T.

1176
01:01:56.931 --> 01:01:58.363
WELL, COULD YOU TRY?

1177
01:01:58.432 --> 01:01:59.665
NO.

1178
01:02:12.847 --> 01:02:14.090
I'VE HAD THIS FEELING

1179
01:02:14.114 --> 01:02:15.592
EVER SINCE I'VE GRADUATED...

1180
01:02:15.616 --> 01:02:17.661
THIS KIND OF COMPULSION
THAT I HAVE TO BE RUDE

1181
01:02:17.685 --> 01:02:21.386
ALL THE TIME, YOU
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1182
01:02:22.289 --> 01:02:23.722
YES, I DO.

1183
01:02:23.791 --> 01:02:26.725
IT'S LIKE I WAS PLAYING
SOME KIND OF GAME,

1184
01:02:26.794 --> 01:02:29.728
BUT THE RULES DON'T
MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME.

1185
01:02:29.797 --> 01:02:32.731
THEY'RE BEING MADE UP
BY ALL THE WRONG PEOPLE.

1186
01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.733
NO. I MEAN, NO ONE
MAKES THEM UP.

1187
01:02:34.802 --> 01:02:37.803
THEY SEEM TO MAKE THEMSELVES UP.

1188
01:02:37.872 --> 01:02:38.987
SAY!

1189
01:02:39.056 --> 01:02:42.708

YOU TURN THAT DOWN?

I COULD MAKE YOU SOME COFFEE.

1203
01:03:38.398 --> 01:03:41.332
NO. I WOULDN'T WANT
TO WAKE ANYONE UP.

1204
01:03:41.401 --> 01:03:43.001
WE WON'T.

1205
01:03:43.070 --> 01:03:45.070
LET'S GO INSIDE.

1206
01:03:46.073 --> 01:03:47.505
WAIT A MINUTE.

1207
01:03:47.575 --> 01:03:49.007
IS ANYTHING WRONG?

1208
01:03:49.076 --> 01:03:51.843
NO. I WAS JUST THINKING.

1209
01:03:51.912 --> 01:03:53.344
IT'S STILL EARLY.

1210
01:03:53.413 --> 01:03:55.391
MAYBE WE COULD DO SOMETHING,

1211
01:03:55.415 --> 01:03:56.982
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

1212
01:03:58.586 --> 01:04:00.052
ALL RIGHT.

1213
01:04:07.427 --> 01:04:08.872
Elaine: WHERE ARE WE GOING?

1214
01:04:08.896 --> 01:04:10.040
Benjamin: I'M TRYING
TO THINK OF...

1215
01:04:10.064 --> 01:04:12.363
WHERE THERE'S A PLACE TO
HAVE A DRINK AROUND HERE.

1216
01:04:12.432 --> 01:04:15.033
ISN'T THERE ONE
AT THE TAFT HOTEL?

1217
01:04:15.102 --> 01:04:16.534
WHAT IS THE MATTER?

1218
01:04:16.604 --> 01:04:20.973
NOTHING. I'M JUST WONDERING
IF THEY HAVE A BAR OR NOT.

1219
01:04:21.041 --> 01:04:22.307
I MEAN, LET'S GO SEE.

1220
01:04:26.046 --> 01:04:27.212
LISTEN, ELAINE,

1221
01:04:27.281 --> 01:04:28.825
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT
THERE ISN'T A BAR HERE.

1222
01:04:28.849 --> 01:04:29.860
I MEAN, AS FAR AS I KNOW.

1223
01:04:29.884 --> 01:04:30.816
OF COURSE THERE IS.

1224
01:04:30.885 --> 01:04:32.484
LOOK, THERE'S THE
PALM ROOM RIGHT THERE.

1225
01:04:32.552 --> 01:04:33.696
GOOD EVENING.

1226
01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:35.654
HELLO. HOW ARE YOU, SIR?

1227
01:04:35.722 --> 01:04:37.200
GOOD EVENING, MR. GLADSTONE.

1228
01:04:37.224 --> 01:04:38.891
HELLO AGAIN.

1229
01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:41.994
HI, MR. GLADSTONE.

1230
01:04:42.062 --> 01:04:44.163
HOW ARE YOU THIS EVENING?

1231
01:04:45.065 --> 01:04:46.165
BENJAMIN?

1232
01:04:46.233 --> 01:04:48.211
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE, ELAINE.

1233
01:04:48.235 --> 01:04:49.512
LET'S GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

1234
01:04:49.536 --> 01:04:50.468
DO THEY KNOW YOU?

1235
01:04:50.537 --> 01:04:51.469
OF COURSE NOT.

1236
01:04:51.538 --> 01:04:52.548
GOOD EVENING, SIR.

1237
01:04:52.572 --> 01:04:55.340
COME ON, ELAINE, WE'RE LEAVING.

1238
01:04:55.409 --> 01:04:57.309
MR. GLADSTONE, HOW ARE YOU?

1239
01:04:57.377 --> 01:04:58.811
BENJAMIN, WHAT'S HAPPENING?

1240
01:04:58.879 --> 01:05:00.412
I DON'T KNOW.

1241
01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:02.358
THEY MUST THINK I LOOK
LIKE THIS GUY GLADSTONE.

1242
01:05:02.382 --> 01:05:03.949
HELLO, MR. BRANIFF.

1243
01:05:16.096 --> 01:05:18.030
ELAINE, I LIKE YOU.

1244
01:05:18.098 --> 01:05:20.032
I LIKE YOU SO MUCH.

1245
01:05:21.001 --> 01:05:22.767
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?

1246
01:05:26.874 --> 01:05:27.973
DO YOU?

1247
01:05:28.042 --> 01:05:29.274
YES.

1248
01:05:30.878 --> 01:05:32.444
YOU'RE THE FIRST...

1249
01:05:33.547 --> 01:05:35.881
YOU'RE THE FIRST
THING FOR SO LONG

1250
01:05:35.950 --> 01:05:38.984
THAT I'VE LIKED,
THE FIRST PERSON

1251
01:05:39.053 --> 01:05:41.653
I COULD STAND TO BE WITH.

1252
01:05:43.057 --> 01:05:46.158
MY WHOLE LIFE IS SUCH A WASTE.

1253
01:05:47.061 --> 01:05:48.626
IT'S JUST NOTHING.

1254
01:05:53.067 --> 01:05:54.166
I'M SORRY.

1255
01:05:54.235 --> 01:05:56.335
I'LL TAKE YOU HOME NOW.

1256
01:05:59.406 --> 01:06:02.524
BENJAMIN, ARE YOU HAVING
AN AFFAIR WITH SOMEONE?

1257
01:06:08.098 --> 01:06:09.198
I'M SORRY.

1258
01:06:09.266 --> 01:06:11.867
I'M SORRY. THAT'S
NOT MY BUSINESS.

1259
01:06:13.103 --> 01:06:14.669
IT JUST HAPPENED.

1260
01:06:16.106 --> 01:06:18.540
IT'S JUST THIS THING
THAT HAPPENED

1261
01:06:18.608 --> 01:06:20.608
ALONG WITH EVERYTHING ELSE.

1262
01:06:21.545 --> 01:06:23.378
CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

1263
01:06:25.048 --> 01:06:27.148
WAS SHE MARRIED OR SOMETHING?

1264
01:06:28.552 --> 01:06:29.785
YES.

1265
01:06:30.721 --> 01:06:32.321
WITH A FAMILY?

1266
01:06:32.389 --> 01:06:35.657
YES. SHE HAD A
HUSBAND AND A SON.

1267
01:06:35.726 --> 01:06:37.826
DID THEY EVER FIND OUT?

1268
01:06:37.894 --> 01:06:39.328
NO.

1269
01:06:42.065 --> 01:06:44.265
AND IT'S ALL OVER NOW?

1270
01:06:47.404 --> 01:06:48.637
YES.

1271
01:06:55.746 --> 01:06:57.178
I'M GLAD.

1272
01:07:07.424 --> 01:07:09.402
Can we do something tomorrow?

1273
01:07:09.426 --> 01:07:11.025
All right.

1274
01:07:11.094 --> 01:07:12.026
During the day

1275
01:07:12.095 --> 01:07:15.029
we'll go for a
drive or something.

1276
01:07:15.098 --> 01:07:16.197
OK.

1277
01:07:16.266 --> 01:07:17.744
You sure you really want to?

1278
01:07:17.768 --> 01:07:18.867
Yes.

1279
01:07:18.935 --> 01:07:20.480
Because I wouldn't
want you to do it

1280
01:07:20.504 --> 01:07:22.349
unless you really wanted to.

1281
01:07:22.373 --> 01:07:23.472
I do.

1282
01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:24.639
You do?

1283
01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:26.140
BENJAMIN, I REALLY DO.

1284
01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:27.976
SHH!

1285
01:07:57.408 --> 01:07:58.857
DRIVE DOWN THE BLOCK.

1286
01:07:58.925 --> 01:08:02.555
MRS. ROBINSON, ELAINE
AND I HAVE A DATE.

1287
01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:03.590
WE'RE GOING FOR A DRIVE.

1288
01:08:03.614 --> 01:08:05.831
DO EXACTLY AS I SAY.

1289
01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:13.522
IT SEEMS TO ME...

1290
01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:15.067
LISTEN TO ME VERY
CAREFULLY, BENJAMIN.

1291
01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:18.026
YOU ARE NOT TO SEE
ELAINE AGAIN EVER.

1292
01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:20.261
THOSE ARE MY
ORDERS. IS THAT CLEAR?

1293
01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:21.340
MRS. ROBINSON, DO YOU THINK...

1294
01:08:21.364 --> 01:08:23.532
I CAN MAKE THINGS
QUITE UNPLEASANT.

1295
01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:24.720
HOW?

1296
01:08:24.768 --> 01:08:27.035
IN ORDER TO KEEP
ELAINE AWAY FROM YOU,

1297
01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:29.972
I'M PREPARED TO
TELL HER EVERYTHING.

1298
01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:33.642
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

1299
01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:36.377
THEN YOU'D BETTER
START BELIEVING ME.

1300
01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:38.647
I JUST DON'T BELIEVE
YOU WOULD DO THAT.

1301
01:08:39.550 --> 01:08:40.949
TRY ME.

1302
01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:48.523
GOD DAMN IT.

1303
01:08:58.468 --> 01:08:59.568
ELAINE!

1304
01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:00.802
ELAINE!

1305
01:09:00.871 --> 01:09:01.970
I'M COMING UP!

1306
01:09:02.038 --> 01:09:04.238
I'M NOT DRESSED YET.

1307
01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:06.588
BENJAMIN, I SAID I
WASN'T DRESSED.

1308
01:09:06.643 --> 01:09:07.787
YOU'VE GOT TO GO
OVER THE BACK FENCE,

1309
01:09:07.811 --> 01:09:09.121
AND I'LL MEET YOU ON THE CORNER.

1310
01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:10.579
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

1311
01:09:10.647 --> 01:09:12.681
HURRY. PUT YOUR SHOES ON.

1312
01:09:12.749 --> 01:09:13.915
Elaine: BENJAMIN.

1313
01:09:13.984 --> 01:09:15.917
BENJAMIN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1314
01:09:15.986 --> 01:09:17.919
ELAINE, I HAVE TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

1315
01:09:17.988 --> 01:09:19.287
WHAT IS IT?

1316
01:09:19.356 --> 01:09:20.689
THAT WOMAN...

1317
01:09:20.757 --> 01:09:22.524
THAT OLDER WOMAN
THAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT...

1318
01:09:22.593 --> 01:09:23.959
YOU MEAN THAT ONE?

1319
01:09:24.027 --> 01:09:26.005
YES. THE MARRIED WOMAN.
THAT WASN'T JUST SOME WOMAN.

1320
01:09:26.029 --> 01:09:27.963
WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME?

1321
01:09:28.031 --> 01:09:31.166
BENJAMIN, WOULD YOU JUST
TELL ME WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

1322
01:09:44.882 --> 01:09:45.981
OH, NO.

1323
01:09:46.049 --> 01:09:47.148
ELAINE.

1324
01:09:47.217 --> 01:09:48.717
OH, MY GOD.

1325
01:09:48.785 --> 01:09:49.818
PLEASE.

1326
01:09:49.887 --> 01:09:51.319
GET OUT OF HERE.

1327
01:09:51.388 --> 01:09:52.487
DON'T CRY.

1328
01:09:52.556 --> 01:09:54.155
GET OUT!

1329
01:09:54.224 --> 01:09:55.344
GET OUT!

1330
01:09:55.392 --> 01:09:56.691
OUT! GET OUT!

1331
01:10:02.065 --> 01:10:03.899

WELL, WELL, WELL!

1355
01:12:12.612 --> 01:12:13.756
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

1356
01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:18.549
BEN SAYS THAT HE AND
ELAINE ARE GETTING MARRIED.

1357
01:12:18.618 --> 01:12:20.051
AAH!

1358
01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:21.530
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

1359
01:12:21.554 --> 01:12:23.487
THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS, RIGHT?

1360
01:12:23.556 --> 01:12:25.489
I'M GOING UP TO BERKELEY TODAY.

1361
01:12:25.558 --> 01:12:29.493
OH, BEN, IT'S SO EXCITING!

1362
01:12:29.562 --> 01:12:31.495
COME ON. WE'VE GOT
TO CALL THE ROBINSONS.

1363
01:12:31.564 --> 01:12:33.497
WE'VE GOT SOMETHING
TO CELEBRATE.

1364
01:12:33.566 --> 01:12:35.967
NO. I THINK YOU'LL
WANT TO WAIT ON THAT.

1365
01:12:36.036 --> 01:12:37.501
OH, THEY DON'T KNOW?

1366
01:12:37.570 --> 01:12:38.970
NO, THEY DON'T.

1367
01:12:39.039 --> 01:12:40.238
WHEN DID YOU DECIDE ALL THIS?

1368
01:12:40.307 --> 01:12:42.140
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

1369
01:12:42.208 --> 01:12:44.809
WAIT A MINUTE. YOU TALKED
TO ELAINE THIS MORNING?

1370
01:12:44.877 --> 01:12:46.722
NO. SHE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT IT.

1371
01:12:46.746 --> 01:12:48.724
SHE DOESN'T KNOW THAT
YOU'RE COMING UP TO BERKELEY?

1372
01:12:48.748 --> 01:12:50.059
NO. ACTUALLY, SHE DOESN'T KNOW

1373
01:12:50.083 --> 01:12:52.183
ABOUT US GETTING MARRIED YET.

1374
01:12:52.252 --> 01:12:55.186
WELL, WHEN DID YOU
TWO TALK THIS OVER?

1375
01:12:55.255 --> 01:12:56.399
WE HAVEN'T.

1376
01:12:56.423 --> 01:12:57.521
YOU HAVEN'T?

1377
01:12:57.590 --> 01:13:01.926
BEN, THIS WHOLE IDEA
SOUNDS PRETTY HALF-BAKED.

1378
01:13:01.995 --> 01:13:04.106
NO, IT'S NOT. IT'S
COMPLETELY BAKED.

1379
01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:05.541
IT'S A DECISION I'VE MADE.

1380
01:13:05.565 --> 01:13:07.031
WELL, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK

1381
01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:08.532
SHE WANTS TO MARRY YOU?

1382
01:13:08.601 --> 01:13:09.533
SHE DOESN'T.

1383
01:13:09.602 --> 01:13:11.080

1384
01:13:11.104 --> 01:13:13.144

1420
01:16:28.201 --> 01:16:30.179

01:16:49.055 --> 01:16:52.156

WHAT?

1430
01:16:57.730 --> 01:16:59.107
ONE OF THOSE OUTSIDE
AGITATORS? OH, NO.

1431
01:16:59.131 --> 01:17:01.765
I HATE THAT. I
WON'T STAND FOR IT.

1432
01:17:01.834 --> 01:17:03.934
I WON'T STAND FOR THAT.

1433
01:18:29.755 --> 01:18:32.115
Benjamin: EXCUSE ME.

1434
01:18:33.092 --> 01:18:34.424
PARDON ME.

1435
01:18:39.265 --> 01:18:42.365
WELL, HOW ABOUT THIS
FOR A COINCIDENCE?

1436
01:18:47.606 --> 01:18:50.540
I WAS WONDERING
WHERE YOU WERE HEADED.

1437
01:18:50.609 --> 01:18:52.042
I'M MEETING SOMEONE.

1438
01:18:52.111 --> 01:18:54.211
AH. WHERE?

1439
01:18:57.116 --> 01:18:59.549
WHERE ARE YOU
MEETING THIS PERSON?

1440
01:18:59.618 --> 01:19:01.051
AT THE ZOO.

1441
01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:02.219
THE ZOO.

1442
01:19:02.288 --> 01:19:05.722
THEY HAVE A PRETTY
GOOD ONE HERE, DO THEY?

1443
01:19:05.791 --> 01:19:08.725
I DON'T KNOW.
I'VE NEVER SEEN IT.

1444
01:19:08.794 --> 01:19:11.061
OH. WELL, I HAVEN'T, EITHER.

1445
01:19:11.130 --> 01:19:14.397
I MIGHT JUST RIDE
OUT THERE WITH YOU.

1446
01:19:18.971 --> 01:19:20.838
Benjamin: IS THAT
HIM OVER THERE?

1447
01:19:20.906 --> 01:19:22.146
Elaine: NO.

1448
01:19:25.044 --> 01:19:26.977
WHERE DID HE SAY HE
WAS GOING TO MEET YOU?

1449
01:19:27.046 --> 01:19:28.756
I THOUGHT HE SAID
BY THE MONKEY HOUSE.

1450
01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:30.047
OH.

1451
01:19:30.115 --> 01:19:31.459
BENJAMIN, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW

1452
01:19:31.483 --> 01:19:33.050
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE.

1453
01:19:33.118 --> 01:19:34.218
HERE? IN BERKELEY?

1454
01:19:34.286 --> 01:19:35.406
YES.

1455
01:19:35.454 --> 01:19:37.721
WELL, I HAVE THIS
VERY PLEASANT ROOM,

1456
01:19:37.789 --> 01:19:39.134
AND I'VE BEEN GETTING
INTO SOME CLASSES.

1457
01:19:39.158 --> 01:19:40.235
BUT YOU'RE NOT ENROLLED.

1458
01:19:40.259 --> 01:19:41.259
NO, I JUST SIT IN.

1459
01:19:41.327 --> 01:19:42.392
THEY DON'T SEEM TO MIND.

1460
01:19:42.461 --> 01:19:44.394
THEY'VE BEEN VERY
CONGENIAL ABOUT IT.

1461
01:19:44.463 --> 01:19:45.606
BENJAMIN, YOU'RE...

1462
01:19:45.630 --> 01:19:48.065
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

1463
01:19:48.133 --> 01:19:50.567
MAYBE WE CAN GET TOGETHER
SOMETIME AND TALK ABOUT IT.

1464
01:19:50.635 --> 01:19:52.269
REALLY INCREDIBLE.

1465
01:19:54.006 --> 01:19:55.372
HERE HE COMES.

1466
01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:56.440
WHAT?

1467
01:19:56.508 --> 01:19:59.159
I GOT A REAL FEELING
THAT THIS IS THE FELLA.

1468
01:20:00.379 --> 01:20:01.311
ELAINE!

1469
01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:03.813
HE CERTAINLY IS A GOOD WALKER.

1470
01:20:03.883 --> 01:20:05.815
AM I LATE? I'M SORRY.

1471
01:20:05.885 --> 01:20:08.585
WE THOUGHT YOU SAID
BY THE MONKEY HOUSE.

1472
01:20:08.653 --> 01:20:11.088
THIS IS BENJAMIN
BRADDOCK. CARL SMITH.

1473
01:20:11.156 --> 01:20:12.901
BENJAMIN RODE HERE
WITH ME ON THE BUS.

1474
01:20:12.925 --> 01:20:14.358
GLAD TO MEET YOU, BEN.

1475
01:20:14.426 --> 01:20:15.859
GREAT MEETING YOU, CARL.

1476
01:20:15.928 --> 01:20:17.493

AND THEN I'M GOING.

1484

NO. I WANT TO KNOW WHY
YOU'RE HERE IN BERKELEY.

1486
01:21:09.148 --> 01:21:10.847
BECAUSE... I AM.

1487
01:21:10.916 --> 01:21:12.615
IS IT BECAUSE I'M HERE?

1488
01:21:12.684 --> 01:21:14.117
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1489
01:21:14.186 --> 01:21:15.618
I THINK IT IS.

1490
01:21:15.687 --> 01:21:17.220
I SAID I THINK IT IS.

1491
01:21:17.289 --> 01:21:18.655
ALL RIGHT, THEN. YES.

1492
01:21:18.723 --> 01:21:19.656
WELL, I WANT YOU TO LEAVE.

1493
01:21:19.724 --> 01:21:21.124
WELL, LOOK, I LOVE YOU.

1494
01:21:21.193 --> 01:21:22.993
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT, BENJAMIN?

1495
01:21:23.062 --> 01:21:24.494
DO YOU JUST HATE EVERYTHING?

1496
01:21:24.563 --> 01:21:26.163
HOW COULD YOU
POSSIBLY RAPE MY MOTHER?

1497
01:21:26.231 --> 01:21:28.332
WHAT? DID YOU SAY RAPE HER?

1498
01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:29.766
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW ANYONE...

1499
01:21:29.835 --> 01:21:31.546
WHAT DID SHE SAY?
TELL ME WHAT SHE SAID.

1500
01:21:31.570 --> 01:21:32.502
WHY?

1501
01:21:32.571 --> 01:21:33.781
BECAUSE IT ISN'T TRUE.

1502
01:21:33.805 --> 01:21:34.972
TELL ME.

1503
01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:36.751
SHE SAID THAT SHE
WAS HAVING A DRINK

1504
01:21:36.775 --> 01:21:37.885
AT THE HOTEL WITH A FRIEND,

1505
01:21:37.909 --> 01:21:40.643
AND THAT YOU WAITED
FOR HER IN THE PARKING LOT

1506
01:21:40.712 --> 01:21:42.690
AND TOLD HER THAT SHE WAS
TOO DRUNK TO DRIVE HOME

1507
01:21:42.714 --> 01:21:44.993
AND THAT YOU WOULD GET
HER A ROOM FOR THE NIGHT.

1508
01:21:45.017 --> 01:21:46.249
OH, THEN WHAT?

1509
01:21:46.318 --> 01:21:48.029
THEN YOU TOOK HER
UPSTAIRS, AND YOU RAPED HER.

1510
01:21:48.053 --> 01:21:50.587
OH, NO, NO. THAT'S
NOT WHAT HAPPENED.

1511
01:21:50.655 --> 01:21:53.357
WHAT HAPPENED WAS THERE
WAS THIS PARTY AT MY PARENTS'.

1512
01:21:53.425 --> 01:21:54.358
I DROVE YOUR MOTHER HOME...

1513
01:21:54.426 --> 01:21:55.903
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS!

1514
01:21:55.927 --> 01:21:57.272
WE WENT UPSTAIRS TO
SEE YOUR PORTRAIT...

1515
01:21:57.296 --> 01:21:58.473
NO! I DON'T!

1516
01:21:58.497 --> 01:22:00.480
SHE STARTED TAKING
HER CLOTHES OFF,

1517
01:22:00.549 --> 01:22:02.916
AND SUDDENLY, THERE SHE
WAS WITHOUT ANY CLOTHES ON...

1518
01:22:02.984 --> 01:22:04.401
I MEAN, REALLY NAKED.

1519
01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:06.336
OH, SHUT... AAH!

1520
01:22:12.844 --> 01:22:15.278
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE?

1521
01:22:19.751 --> 01:22:21.118
OH, HELLO, MR. McCLEERY.

1522
01:22:21.186 --> 01:22:22.119
WHO SCREAMED?

1523
01:22:22.187 --> 01:22:23.620
IT'S ALL RIGHT, MR. McCLEERY.

1524
01:22:23.688 --> 01:22:25.400
SCREAMING IS NOT ALL RIGHT,

1525
01:22:25.424 --> 01:22:27.168
NOT IN MY HOUSE, IT ISN'T.

1526
01:22:27.192 --> 01:22:30.127
IT WAS JUST A VISITOR,
BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW.

1527
01:22:30.195 --> 01:22:32.629
WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER?

1528
01:22:32.697 --> 01:22:34.131
LOOK, SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

1529
01:22:34.199 --> 01:22:36.099
SHE'S UPSET, AND SHE
SCREAMED, BUT IT'S OK NOW.

1530
01:22:36.168 --> 01:22:38.068
SHALL I GET THE COPS?
I'LL GET THE COPS.

1531
01:22:38.137 --> 01:22:39.503
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

1532
01:22:39.571 --> 01:22:41.004
NOW, DAMN IT, LOOK.

1533
01:22:41.073 --> 01:22:43.740
HERE SHE IS, HAVING SOME WATER.

1534
01:22:43.808 --> 01:22:46.543
THERE'S NO NEED FOR
THE COPS OR ANYTHING.

1535
01:22:46.611 --> 01:22:48.045
ALL RIGHT, BOYS,

1536
01:22:48.113 --> 01:22:50.225
YOU CAN ALL GO BACK
TO YOUR ROOMS NOW.

1537
01:22:50.249 --> 01:22:51.881
GO AHEAD.

1538
01:22:51.950 --> 01:22:55.085
WE WON'T HAVE ANY
MORE OF THIS AGITATION.

1539
01:22:56.055 --> 01:22:57.487
WILL WE, BRADDOCK?

1540
01:22:57.556 --> 01:22:58.721
NO, SIR.

1541
01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:03.326
I WANT YOU OUT OF HERE.

1542
01:23:03.395 --> 01:23:04.827
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1543
01:23:04.896 --> 01:23:06.374
YOU HEARD ME... OUT OF HERE.

1544
01:23:06.398 --> 01:23:07.398
WHAT FOR?

1545
01:23:40.599 --> 01:23:42.666
I'M SORRY I SCREAMED.

1546
01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:49.339
BENJAMIN, WHEN YOU CAME UP HERE,

1547
01:23:49.408 --> 01:23:52.143
WHAT DID YOU THINK WAS
GOING TO HAPPEN BETWEEN US?

1548
01:23:52.211 --> 01:23:54.078
ELAINE, RIGHT NOW

1549
01:23:54.147 --> 01:23:55.758
I DON'T FEEL LIKE TALKING MUCH.

1550
01:23:55.782 --> 01:23:57.259
I'M SORRY ABOUT EVERYTHING,

1551
01:23:57.283 --> 01:24:00.251
BUT I THINK I'LL
JUST DO THIS NOW.

1552
01:24:11.197 --> 01:24:14.131
CAN I JUST SIT HERE
WHILE YOU'RE PACKING?

1553
01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:15.816
IF YOU WANT.

1554
01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:30.731
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NOW?

1555
01:24:31.634 --> 01:24:33.200
I DON'T KNOW.

1556
01:24:34.137 --> 01:24:35.569
ARE YOU GOING HOME?

1557
01:24:35.638 --> 01:24:36.715
NO.

1558
01:24:36.739 --> 01:24:38.839
WELL, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

1559
01:24:41.744 --> 01:24:45.579
ELAINE, YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO STOP ASKING ME THAT.

1560
01:24:57.093 --> 01:25:00.010
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO LEAVE TOMORROW.

1561
01:25:02.231 --> 01:25:04.131
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1562
01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:07.401
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GO ANYWHERE...

1563
01:25:09.105 --> 01:25:12.039
UNTIL YOU HAVE A DEFINITE PLAN.

1564
01:25:12.108 --> 01:25:13.540
GOOD-BYE.

1565
01:25:49.278 --> 01:25:50.677
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

1566
01:25:50.746 --> 01:25:51.678
BENJAMIN?

1567
01:25:51.747 --> 01:25:52.813
WHAT?

1568
01:25:58.821 --> 01:26:00.287
WILL YOU KISS ME?

1569
01:26:27.817 --> 01:26:29.857
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

1570
01:26:33.088 --> 01:26:34.722
YOU WON'T?

1571
01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:35.856
I DON'T KNOW.

1572
01:26:39.161 --> 01:26:40.761
BUT YOU MIGHT?

1573
01:26:41.697 --> 01:26:43.063
I MIGHT.

1574
01:26:43.131 --> 01:26:44.998
IS THAT SO?

1575
01:26:45.067 --> 01:26:46.867
YOU MIGHT MARRY ME?

1576
01:26:46.935 --> 01:26:49.135
YES.

1577
01:26:49.204 --> 01:26:50.437
WHEN?

1578
01:26:51.474 --> 01:26:53.306
I DON'T KNOW.

1579
01:26:53.376 --> 01:26:54.808
HOW ABOUT TOMORROW?

1580
01:26:54.877 --> 01:26:57.310
I DON'T MEAN TO BE PUSHY.

1581
01:26:57.380 --> 01:26:59.145
I DON'T KNOW.

1582
01:26:59.214 --> 01:27:01.548
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING.

1583
01:27:02.818 --> 01:27:05.058
YOU MEAN YOU'RE CONFUSED?

1584
01:27:07.289 --> 01:27:09.590
LOOK, DON'T BE CONFUSED.

1585
01:27:09.658 --> 01:27:11.425
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

1586
01:27:12.961 --> 01:27:15.596
I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN.

1587
01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:19.800
WE JUST CAN.

1588
01:27:27.175 --> 01:27:29.342
I HAVE TO GO NOW.

1589
01:27:30.479 --> 01:27:31.845
HEY, ELAINE?

1590
01:27:33.282 --> 01:27:35.602
ARE YOU SERIOUS ABOUT THIS?

1591
01:27:36.419 --> 01:27:37.851
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

1592
01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:39.520
YOU REALLY WILL?

1593
01:27:39.588 --> 01:27:40.954
YES.

1594
01:27:53.469 --> 01:27:55.769
GOOD GOD.

1595
01:27:57.205 --> 01:27:59.284
Benjamin: WE CAN GO GET
OUR BLOOD TESTS TOMORROW.

1596
01:27:59.308 --> 01:28:00.308
Elaine: TOMORROW?

1597
01:28:00.342 --> 01:28:02.086
OR THIS AFTERNOON.
IT'S A GOOD DAY FOR IT.

1598
01:28:02.110 --> 01:28:04.311
BENJAMIN, I HAVEN'T EVEN
SAID I'LL MARRY YOU YET.

1599
01:28:04.379 --> 01:28:06.357
WE'LL NEED OUR
BIRTH CERTIFICATES.

1600
01:28:06.381 --> 01:28:07.392
I HAPPEN TO HAVE MINE WITH ME.

1601
01:28:07.416 --> 01:28:08.649
WHERE'S YOURS?

1602
01:28:08.717 --> 01:28:11.151
I JUST DON'T THINK
IT WOULD WORK.

1603
01:28:11.219 --> 01:28:12.397
WHY WOULDN'T IT?

1604
01:28:23.231 --> 01:28:24.665
WHY WOULDN'T IT?

1605
01:28:24.733 --> 01:28:27.701
I JUST DON'T THINK IT WOULD.

1606
01:28:27.770 --> 01:28:29.102
TOMORROW, THEN.

1607
01:28:29.171 --> 01:28:30.971
CAN WE GET OUR BLOOD
TESTS TOMORROW MORNING?

1608
01:28:31.941 --> 01:28:33.852
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRAG ME OFF

1609
01:28:33.876 --> 01:28:35.620
IF YOU WANT TO MARRY ME SO MUCH?

1610
01:28:35.644 --> 01:28:37.644
WHY DON'T I JUST DRAG YOU OFF?

1611
01:28:37.713 --> 01:28:39.145
ALL RIGHT, I WILL,

1612
01:28:39.214 --> 01:28:41.448
RIGHT AFTER WE
GET THE BLOOD TESTS.

1613
01:28:41.517 --> 01:28:42.727
I HAVE TO SEE CARL FIRST.

1614
01:28:42.751 --> 01:28:44.485
CARL WHO?

1615
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:49.857
CARL WHO?

1616
01:28:49.925 --> 01:28:52.092
CARL SMITH. HE'S A
MEDICAL STUDENT.

1617
01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:53.572
WE'VE KNOWN HIM FOR YEARS.

1618
01:28:53.596 --> 01:28:54.728
WHO, THAT GUY AT THE ZOO?

1619
01:28:54.797 --> 01:28:55.729
YES.

1620
01:28:55.798 --> 01:28:57.230
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO SEE HIM?

1621
01:28:57.299 --> 01:28:58.610
WELL, I SAID I MIGHT MARRY HIM.

1622
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:02.268
YOU WHAT?!

1623
01:29:02.337 --> 01:29:04.270
HOW DID HE DO IT?

1624
01:29:04.339 --> 01:29:05.939
DID HE GET DOWN ON HIS KNEES?

1625
01:29:06.008 --> 01:29:07.774
HE DIDN'T GET DOWN
ON HIS KNEES, I HOPE.

1626
01:29:07.843 --> 01:29:09.109
NO, BENJAMIN.

1627
01:29:09.177 --> 01:29:11.612
WHAT DID HE SAY? I'M CURIOUS.

1628
01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:12.613
SHH.

1629
01:29:12.681 --> 01:29:15.115
HE SAID HE THOUGHT WE'D MAKE

1630
01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:16.617
A PRETTY GOOD TEAM.

1631
01:29:16.685 --> 01:29:18.485
OH, NO. HE SAID THAT?

1632
01:29:18.554 --> 01:29:19.486
SHH!

1633
01:29:19.555 --> 01:29:22.122
WHERE DID HE DO IT?

1634
01:29:23.025 --> 01:29:26.109
I'D LIKE TO KNOW
WHERE IT HAPPENED.

1635
01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:31.632
IT WASN'T IN HIS CAR, WAS IT?

1636
01:29:43.045 --> 01:29:45.078
GOOD NIGHT.

1637
01:29:45.147 --> 01:29:47.981
ARE WE GETTING MARRIED TOMORROW?

1638
01:29:48.050 --> 01:29:49.182
NO.

1639
01:29:50.185 --> 01:29:52.019
THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW?

1640
01:29:53.488 --> 01:29:54.922
I DON'T KNOW.

1641
01:29:54.990 --> 01:29:58.058
MAYBE WE ARE, AND
MAYBE WE'RE NOT.

1642
01:30:44.856 --> 01:30:46.089
AAH!

1643
01:30:47.292 --> 01:30:49.225
DO YOU WANT TO, UH...

1644
01:30:49.294 --> 01:30:51.895
DO YOU WANT TO TRY AND
TELL ME WHY YOU DID IT?

1645
01:30:52.798 --> 01:30:53.730
MR. ROBINSON.

1646
01:30:53.799 --> 01:30:56.833
DO YOU HAVE A SPECIAL
GRUDGE AGAINST ME?

1647
01:30:56.902 --> 01:30:59.368
DO YOU FEEL A PARTICULARLY
STRONG RESENTMENT?

1648
01:30:59.437 --> 01:31:02.138
IS THERE SOMETHING I'VE SAID
THAT'S CAUSED THIS CONTEMPT,

1649
01:31:02.207 --> 01:31:04.273
OR IS IT JUST THINGS I STAND FOR

1650
01:31:04.342 --> 01:31:05.274
THAT YOU DESPISE?

1651
01:31:05.343 --> 01:31:07.454
IT WAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU, SIR.

1652
01:31:07.478 --> 01:31:09.713
WELL, BEN, IT WAS QUITE
A BIT TO DO WITH ME.

1653
01:31:09.781 --> 01:31:11.681
NOW, LOOK, PLEASE...

1654
01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:13.094
BEN, I THINK WE'RE 2
CIVILIZED HUMAN BEINGS.

1655
01:31:13.118 --> 01:31:14.295
DO YOU THINK IT'S NECESSARY

1656
01:31:14.319 --> 01:31:15.496
TO THREATEN EACH OTHER?

1657
01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:16.586
I'M NOT THREATENING YOU.

1658
01:31:16.654 --> 01:31:18.632
DO YOU WANT TO UNCLENCH
YOUR FIST, PLEASE?

1659
01:31:18.656 --> 01:31:20.090
THANK YOU.

1660
01:31:20.158 --> 01:31:21.302
I CAN SEE IN THE DARK, YOU KNOW.

1661
01:31:21.326 --> 01:31:22.804
I'VE BEEN HERE QUITE A WHILE.

1662
01:31:22.828 --> 01:31:23.960
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU

1663
01:31:24.029 --> 01:31:26.262
I HAVE NO PERSONAL FEELINGS
ABOUT YOU, MR. ROBINSON.

1664
01:31:26.331 --> 01:31:28.064
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU
I DO NOT RESENT YOU.

1665
01:31:28.133 --> 01:31:30.600
YOU DON'T RESPECT ME
TERRIBLY MUCH, EITHER.

1666
01:31:31.669 --> 01:31:32.602
NO, SIR.

1667
01:31:32.670 --> 01:31:34.270
WHAT?

1668
01:31:34.339 --> 01:31:35.750
NO, SIR... DON'T SHOUT AT ME.

1669
01:31:35.774 --> 01:31:36.706
I MAY NOT BE AS YOUNG AS YOU,

1670
01:31:36.775 --> 01:31:38.753
BUT I STILL HAVE
PRETTY GOOD HEARING.

1671
01:31:38.777 --> 01:31:39.709
MR. ROBINSON...

1672
01:31:39.778 --> 01:31:42.712
HAVE THE DECENCY
TO WAIT UNTIL I FINISH.

1673
01:31:42.781 --> 01:31:44.592
I DO THINK YOU SHOULD
KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES

1674
01:31:44.616 --> 01:31:46.049
OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

1675
01:31:46.118 --> 01:31:47.628
I DO THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW

1676
01:31:47.652 --> 01:31:49.463
THAT MY WIFE AND I ARE
GETTING A DIVORCE SOON.

1677
01:31:49.487 --> 01:31:51.320
BUT WHY?

1678
01:31:51.389 --> 01:31:53.139
WHY?!

1679
01:31:53.208 --> 01:31:54.640
LISTEN TO ME.

1680
01:31:54.710 --> 01:31:57.443
WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN
MRS. ROBINSON AND ME

1681
01:31:57.512 --> 01:31:58.444
WAS NOTHING.

1682
01:31:58.513 --> 01:31:59.946
IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

1683
01:32:00.015 --> 01:32:03.616
WE MIGHT JUST AS WELL
HAVE BEEN SHAKING HANDS.

1684
01:32:03.685 --> 01:32:04.918
SHAKING HANDS.

1685
01:32:04.986 --> 01:32:08.054
THAT'S NOT SAYING
MUCH FOR MY WIFE, IS IT?

1686
01:32:08.123 --> 01:32:09.055
YOU MISS THE POINT.

1687
01:32:09.124 --> 01:32:10.056
I GUESS I DO.

1688
01:32:10.125 --> 01:32:11.825
THE POINT IS, I DON'T
LOVE YOUR WIFE.

1689
01:32:11.893 --> 01:32:13.827
I LOVE YOUR DAUGHTER, SIR.

1690
01:32:13.895 --> 01:32:15.829
ALL RIGHT. NOW LISTEN TO THIS.

1691
01:32:15.897 --> 01:32:18.297
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
I CAN PROSECUTE,

1692
01:32:18.366 --> 01:32:19.532
BUT I THINK I CAN.

1693
01:32:19.601 --> 01:32:21.378
I THINK I CAN GET
YOU BEHIND BARS

1694
01:32:21.402 --> 01:32:23.837
IF YOU EVER LOOK AT
MY DAUGHTER AGAIN.

1695
01:32:23.905 --> 01:32:24.938
I'VE SEEN ELAINE,

1696
01:32:25.006 --> 01:32:26.483
AND I'VE MADE DAMN SURE
YOU CAN'T GET TO HER.

1697
01:32:26.507 --> 01:32:29.142
STAY AWAY FROM ME, BEN!

1698
01:32:29.211 --> 01:32:30.688
I DON'T WANT TO
MINCE WORDS WITH YOU.

1699
01:32:30.712 --> 01:32:32.190
AS FAR AS ELAINE IS CONCERNED,

1700
01:32:32.214 --> 01:32:35.281
YOU'RE TO GET HER OUT OF
YOUR FILTHY MIND RIGHT NOW.

1701
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:37.617
IS THAT PERFECTLY CLEAR TO YOU?

1702
01:32:37.686 --> 01:32:39.118
AND THAT'S ALL, BEN.

1703
01:32:39.187 --> 01:32:41.087
YOU'LL PARDON ME

1704
01:32:41.155 --> 01:32:43.289
IF I DON'T SHAKE HANDS WITH YOU.

1705
01:32:44.192 --> 01:32:46.125
I THINK YOU ARE FILTH.

1706
01:32:46.194 --> 01:32:48.494
I THINK YOU ARE SCUM!

1707
01:32:50.498 --> 01:32:52.131
YOU ARE A DEGENERATE!

1708
01:32:58.172 --> 01:32:59.372
HI.

1709
01:33:01.476 --> 01:33:04.043
MR. McCLEERY, DO YOU
HAVE SOME CHANGE?

1710
01:33:04.112 --> 01:33:05.411
I NEED TO USE THE PHONE.

1711
01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:07.447
I WANT YOU OUT OF HERE.

1712
01:33:07.515 --> 01:33:09.982
LOOK, I'LL GIVE
YOU $10 FOR A DIME.

1713
01:33:10.051 --> 01:33:12.017
I'LL GIVE YOU 20.

1714
01:33:12.086 --> 01:33:14.787
FOR GOD'S SAKE, WILL YOU
LET ME USE THAT PHONE?

1715
01:33:14.856 --> 01:33:16.589
I'M GOING TO CALL
THE POLICE... NOW.

1716
01:33:16.658 --> 01:33:19.091
COULD I MAKE ONE
PHONE CALL FIRST?

1717
01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:20.727
GET OUT OF HERE!

1718
01:33:32.106 --> 01:33:33.618
Woman: ELAINE ROBINSON
HAS LEFT SCHOOL.

1719
01:33:33.642 --> 01:33:38.645
HER ROOMMATE'S COMING
DOWN WITH A NOTE FOR YOU.

1720
01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:43.583
Elaine: DEAR BENJAMIN,
PLEASE FORGIVE ME,

1721
01:33:43.652 --> 01:33:45.451
BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING

1722
01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:46.886
IS THE BEST THING FOR YOU.

1723
01:33:46.954 --> 01:33:50.222
MY FATHER IS SO UPSET.
YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND.

1724
01:33:50.292 --> 01:33:52.332
I LOVE YOU, BUT IT
WOULD NEVER WORK OUT.

HELLO, BENJAMIN.

1743
01:35:26.087 --> 01:35:27.387
WHERE IS SHE?

1744
01:35:27.455 --> 01:35:29.099
HELLO. GET ME
THE POLICE, PLEASE.

1745
01:35:29.123 --> 01:35:30.055
WHERE'S ELAINE?

1746
01:35:30.124 --> 01:35:31.502
I'LL BE WITH YOU IN
A MOMENT, BENJAMIN.

1747
01:35:31.526 --> 01:35:32.636
DO YOU HAVE A PATROL CAR

1748
01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:34.572
IN THE VICINITY OF
1200 GLENVIEW ROAD?

1749
01:35:34.596 --> 01:35:37.029
GOOD. WE HAVE A BURGLAR HERE.

1750
01:35:37.098 --> 01:35:38.676
JUST A SECOND. I'LL ASK HIM.

1751
01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:40.433
ARE YOU ARMED?

1752
01:35:41.919 --> 01:35:43.848
NO, I DON'T BELIEVE HE IS.

1753
01:35:43.872 --> 01:35:44.937
THANK YOU.

1754
01:35:45.874 --> 01:35:47.507
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO HER?

1755
01:35:47.575 --> 01:35:49.909
I THINK WE HAVE EVERYTHING
QUITE UNDER CONTROL NOW.

1756
01:35:49.977 --> 01:35:52.044
WOULD YOU LIKE A QUICK
DRINK BEFORE YOU GO?

1757
01:35:52.113 --> 01:35:53.679
YOU CAN'T STOP ME
FROM SEEING HER.

1758
01:35:53.748 --> 01:35:55.481
I'LL FIND HER.

1759
01:35:55.550 --> 01:35:57.910
SORRY WE WON'T BE ABLE TO
INVITE YOU TO THE WEDDING,

1760
01:35:57.952 --> 01:36:00.219
BUT THE ARRANGEMENTS
HAVE BEEN SO RUSHED.

1761
01:36:01.188 --> 01:36:05.291

1762
01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:07.527
AW.

I DON'T THINK YOU'LL HAVE TIME

1764
01:36:09.997 --> 01:36:12.009
FOR THAT DRINK AFTER ALL.

1765
01:36:12.033 --> 01:36:13.466
I'LL FIND HER.

1766
01:36:13.535 --> 01:36:15.802
