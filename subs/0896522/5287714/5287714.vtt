I know rabbits are normally
associated with Easter,

4
00:02:00.154 --> 00:02:03.123
but me, I'm all about
the winter holidays.

5
00:02:03.124 --> 00:02:06.397
If you ask me, there's no better time
to come out of your own little hole

6
00:02:06.422 --> 00:02:10.068

giving with everybody you see.

Good morning, Mr. Duck.

9
00:02:53.241 --> 00:02:55.442
I told that pig to be here.

10
00:03:09.524 --> 00:03:11.792
What do I look like? An ATM?

11
00:03:11.793 --> 00:03:14.832
Why is it around the holidays.

12
00:03:14.857 --> 00:03:19.442
every vagrant thinks they're
entitled to hit up hardworking businessmen?

13
00:03:22.372 --> 00:03:26.416
Hey, doc, that's no way
to treat those less fortunate.

Security! Get over here

33
00:05:38.727 --> 00:05:40.383
Note to self.

34
00:05:40.408 --> 00:05:44.711
Choose words carefully when
berating the security guy.

35
00:06:05.927 --> 00:06:10.012
<i>Attention, everybody, it's
the busiest day of the year.</i>

36
00:06:15.821 --> 00:06:18.490
No eating on the job, Coyote.

37
00:06:33.062 --> 00:06:35.104
<i>Wake up and smell

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:37.998
What does he think
this is, a holiday?

39
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.052
Home sweet home. How I
miss you at the holidays.

40
00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:55.524
Stop daydreaming, space boy.

41
00:07:01.549 --> 00:07:03.851
And triple the price
on everything.

42
00:07:03.876 --> 00:07:06.677
Parents are suckers
this time of year.

43
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:24.125
You have no need <i>pour le
parfume,</i> my Christmas kitty.

44
00:07:25.829 --> 00:07:29.859
You smell of the sweetest garden
in the bloom of the spring.

45
00:07:32.126 --> 00:07:36.398
Hey, Casanova, that's not what I meant
when I said "woo the customers."

46
00:07:36.423 --> 00:07:38.391
Watch the master.

47
00:07:39.664 --> 00:07:41.637
Take my advice,
tuna breath.

48
00:07:41.662 --> 00:07:45.165
Buy a quart of the expensive
stuff and gargle with it.

49
00:07:53.874 --> 00:07:57.477
Hello, my sweet,
you are new, <i>non?</i>

50
00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:09.789
Merry Christmas, <i>Senor</i> Duck.

51
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:12.792
Or as they say in my country,
<i>Feliz Navidad!</i>

52
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.277
<i>Tonto.</i>

53
00:08:15.816 --> 00:08:17.702
What did you call me?

54
00:08:18.461 --> 00:08:22.570
<i>Tonto.</i> It means, uh,
"genius" in Spanish.

55
00:08:23.794 --> 00:08:28.770
Well, in that case, I guess I'm
the biggest <i>tonto</i> in the world.

56
00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:31.887
Finally. A little respect.

57
00:08:31.912 --> 00:08:34.948
Now where's that assistant
manager gone this time?

58
00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:37.032
<i>Mr. Assistant Manager?</i>

59
00:08:37.057 --> 00:08:38.925
<i>Move it, lazybones!</i>

60
00:08:39.766 --> 00:08:42.498
Assistant Manager Porky Pig
reporting for...

61
00:08:42.523 --> 00:08:44.523
For service, sir.

62
00:08:46.961 --> 00:08:49.237
Nice footwork, twinkle hooves.

63
00:09:08.672 --> 00:09:10.973
<i>Mr. Assistant Manager,</i>

64
00:09:10.998 --> 00:09:14.444
<i>your boss wants to see
your butt this instant!</i>

65
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.605
Be careful what you ask for.

66
00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:01.861
Eh, what's up, duck?

67
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.014
Care for a candy cane?

68
00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:08.246
Stop snacking
on store merchandise, mister,

69
00:10:08.271 --> 00:10:11.320
or I'll see to it that
you're arrested for stealing.

70
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.804
You might wanna stay away from
the "s" words until you work through

71
00:10:17.829 --> 00:10:20.162
that little
spitting problem of yours.

72
00:10:20.187 --> 00:10:22.355
M-M-M-Maybe you could
see a speech...

73
00:10:22.356 --> 00:10:25.758
specialist.

74
00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:29.493
You are demoted to Assistant
Assistant Manager.

75
00:10:31.666 --> 00:10:35.284
And you are messing with the wrong
duck, mister.

76
00:10:35.309 --> 00:10:39.550
Well, I guess I could just take my
last minute shopping list elsewhere.

77
00:10:48.716 --> 00:10:52.911
We rabbits are very "prodigical" when
it comes to having big families.

78
00:10:53.379 --> 00:10:56.665
I've never liked families.
But I do love money.

79
00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:00.093
So shop till you drop, and don't
forget to pay for the candy canes!

80
00:11:00.094 --> 00:11:03.389
Oh, I intend to, Duck. But before
I make my final purchases,

81
00:11:03.414 --> 00:11:06.308
I'm gonna need a second
opinion on a few items.

82
00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:09.417
I don't have the time to...
What about these earmuffs for my aunt Bunny

83
00:11:09.442 --> 00:11:12.214
and these ski goggles
for my cousin Franz?

84
00:11:12.239 --> 00:11:15.455
How about this magic fairy dress-up
costume for my niece Betty?

85
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.677
And how about this pacifier
for Baby Bunny?

86
00:11:17.678 --> 00:11:20.446
And this bowling ball
for my uncle Peter?

87
00:11:22.783 --> 00:11:24.927
Okay. Fun's over.

88
00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:33.534
You... You...

89
00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:35.559
Customer or no customer,
get outta my sight!

90
00:11:35.584 --> 00:11:37.472
Out! Out! Out!

91
00:11:38.335 --> 00:11:40.175
For shame. For shame.

92
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.403
Has your holiday spirit
flown south for the winter?

93
00:11:43.404 --> 00:11:45.872
In case you haven't noticed,

94
00:11:47.504 --> 00:11:49.808
I hate the holidays!

95
00:11:50.388 --> 00:11:53.309
You don't say?
Well, bah, humduck!

96
00:11:55.258 --> 00:11:58.467
"Bah, humduck"? I like that!

97
00:11:58.492 --> 00:12:00.156
Bah, humduck.

98
00:12:01.142 --> 00:12:03.866
If I were you,
I'd be careful, Duck.

99
00:12:03.891 --> 00:12:07.460
Bad things happen to people
who mess with Christmas.

100
00:12:07.461 --> 00:12:09.429
Oh, yeah? Like what?

101
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:13.933
Well, if they're really bad,
and I think you fit the bill,

102
00:12:13.934 --> 00:12:17.947
they get visited
by the ghosts of Christmas.

103
00:12:19.182 --> 00:12:23.936
I'm not afraid of ghosts. In fact,
I'm not afraid of anything.

104
00:12:23.961 --> 00:12:27.957
Except perhaps low quarterly profit
projections and personal intimacy.

105
00:12:27.982 --> 00:12:31.114
So again I say, bah, humduck!

106
00:12:46.795 --> 00:12:49.600
Sir, now that you've finished
with your daily...

107
00:12:51.025 --> 00:12:54.405
abuse, I was wondering
if I could ask a favor.

108
00:12:54.515 --> 00:12:57.119
Do I know you? Y-Y-Y-Yes, sir.

109
00:12:57.144 --> 00:13:00.073
I'm your Assistant
Assistant Manager.

110
00:13:00.098 --> 00:13:02.057
Do I like you?

111
00:13:02.831 --> 00:13:05.121
You don't really
like anyone, sir.

112
00:13:09.737 --> 00:13:11.743
I remember you now.

113
00:13:11.768 --> 00:13:14.336
And you're right,
I don't like you.

114
00:13:14.939 --> 00:13:19.551
That said, sir, I've worked
very hard for you all year long

115
00:13:19.576 --> 00:13:21.263
and well, my daughter Pricilla,

116
00:13:21.288 --> 00:13:24.146
really, really wants that Pretty
Pudgy Piggy doll for Christmas.

117
00:13:24.171 --> 00:13:25.905
It's all she talks about, sir.

118
00:13:25.906 --> 00:13:28.107
She's my only daughter
and I love her so much.

119
00:13:28.108 --> 00:13:30.500
I really would like
to buy it for her.

120
00:13:30.525 --> 00:13:33.913
But since you tripled
the price, I can't afford it.

121
00:13:33.914 --> 00:13:37.493
Can't afford it, huh?
What if you stopped eating?

122
00:13:37.518 --> 00:13:39.552
I don't eat much as it is, sir.

123
00:13:39.553 --> 00:13:41.220
I can't on my salary.

124
00:13:41.221 --> 00:13:44.867
Then how do you explain
the big pink gut, pork chop?

125
00:13:46.337 --> 00:13:48.037
Uh, I'm a pig, sir.

126
00:13:48.062 --> 00:13:51.230
You said it, I didn't.
Oh, uh, please, sir!

127
00:13:51.231 --> 00:13:52.568
It's the...

128
00:13:53.769 --> 00:13:55.169
It's...

129
00:13:55.304 --> 00:13:56.517
Hold that thought.

130
00:13:59.139 --> 00:14:00.907
But it's Christmas.

131
00:14:03.688 --> 00:14:06.438
♪♪

132
00:14:10.078 --> 00:14:11.427
Hmm.

133
00:14:11.452 --> 00:14:14.442
Profits are good,
but we could do better.

134
00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.367
What do you think,
hovering cat guy?

135
00:14:22.997 --> 00:14:23.997
Yikes!

136
00:14:25.223 --> 00:14:28.448
Do my eyes deceive me or
am I being visited by...

137
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:33.749
Sylvester the Cat.
Alias Sylvester the investor.

138
00:14:33.774 --> 00:14:38.133
Unscrupulous CEO of the super-successful
Cat's Meow Superstores.

139
00:14:38.158 --> 00:14:40.956
You. You were my idol,

140
00:14:40.981 --> 00:14:42.595
my inspiration.

141
00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.328
Say, you're...

142
00:14:44.353 --> 00:14:47.691
Deceased? A spirit? A ghost?

143
00:14:47.716 --> 00:14:49.364
Why, yes, I am.

144
00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:52.959
I have been so since
last Christmas Eve

145
00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:57.206
when a disgruntled employee
squashed me with a forklift.

146
00:14:58.555 --> 00:14:59.942
Nine times.

147
00:15:01.454 --> 00:15:05.788
That's what I said. But it was
a fitting end for me, Duck.

148
00:15:05.813 --> 00:15:08.884
You see, I was like you.

149
00:15:08.909 --> 00:15:12.170
Small-minded, selfish,
and seriously greedy.

150
00:15:12.195 --> 00:15:18.905
And if you don't change your ways,
you'll end up just like yours truly.

151
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.053
Not a chance.

152
00:15:21.101 --> 00:15:24.545
I'd never be stupid enough to
buy my employees a forklift.

153
00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:26.023
You're missing the point.

154
00:15:26.059 --> 00:15:28.561
You need to start putting
other people's needs

155
00:15:28.562 --> 00:15:31.030
in front of the almighty dollar.

156
00:15:41.208 --> 00:15:43.676
Yes. It's going
to hurt at first.

157
00:15:43.677 --> 00:15:46.012
But it's your only hope.

158
00:15:46.013 --> 00:15:48.223
Before the night is through,

159
00:15:48.248 --> 00:15:52.051
you'll be visited
by three more ghosts.

160
00:15:52.052 --> 00:15:55.054
Each more terrifying
than the last.

161
00:15:55.055 --> 00:15:58.518
Each on a quest
for your very soul!

162
00:15:58.543 --> 00:16:03.005
Change, Daffy.
Before it's too late.

163
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:06.636
Wait a minute. This is some kind of trick.
Who put you up to this?

164
00:16:06.661 --> 00:16:09.229
Was it the rabbit? Or did
my subordinates hire you

165
00:16:09.254 --> 00:16:12.004
to scare me into treating them
with some dignity?

166
00:16:12.005 --> 00:16:13.168
You're doomed.

167
00:16:16.113 --> 00:16:18.453
Doomed!

168
00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:25.071
What's up, Duck?

169
00:16:31.258 --> 00:16:33.159
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

170
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.994
What are you doing here?

171
00:16:34.995 --> 00:16:37.368
I asked the little guy
in the helmet downstairs

172
00:16:37.393 --> 00:16:40.737
if he knew of any cheap skates
and he sent me up here.

173
00:16:40.762 --> 00:16:42.635
Out! Out! Out!

174
00:17:03.342 --> 00:17:06.077
I'm okay. I'm all right.

175
00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:14.419
Beep beep!

176
00:17:14.444 --> 00:17:16.939
There's something
about that sound you make.

177
00:17:16.964 --> 00:17:19.299
It just plain jangles my nerves.

178
00:17:34.838 --> 00:17:36.422
Ouch!

179
00:17:39.493 --> 00:17:45.506
Well, looky here. It's a
Christmas present just for me.

180
00:17:45.531 --> 00:17:49.195
And it's from
my favorite person. Me.

181
00:17:55.566 --> 00:18:00.754
My very own Task-Master 7000
Smart Office Remote.

182
00:18:00.779 --> 00:18:02.536
Thank you, me.

183
00:18:41.188 --> 00:18:42.488
Huh?

184
00:18:47.294 --> 00:18:48.861
What is it, Fudd?

185
00:18:54.019 --> 00:18:55.207
Ouch!

186
00:18:58.011 --> 00:19:00.248
Well, what is it, Fudd?

187
00:19:01.875 --> 00:19:03.776
Sorry to bother you, sir,

188
00:19:03.777 --> 00:19:07.348
but I've worked 37 straight
triple shifts, Mr. Duck.

189
00:19:12.583 --> 00:19:14.984
Yeah, yeah, get on with it.

190
00:19:15.222 --> 00:19:16.889
I'm delirious, sir.

191
00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:18.728
I can't keep my eyes open.

192
00:19:22.214 --> 00:19:25.665
Drink espresso. Pinch yourself.
Just get back to work!

193
00:19:30.871 --> 00:19:33.035
Ooh! Who does he think he...

194
00:19:44.951 --> 00:19:47.920
I am so very homesick, Mr. Duck.

195
00:19:47.921 --> 00:19:49.225
Well, get back to work.

196
00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:52.764
But it's Christmas Eve
and I miss my family.

197
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:56.505
I long to hang garland on the
laser annihilator cannon.

198
00:19:58.009 --> 00:20:00.993
Okay, I think I can arrange it.

199
00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.209
Oh, goodie, goodie.

200
00:20:03.234 --> 00:20:05.795
Bon voyage, space boy.

201
00:20:08.625 --> 00:20:11.653
Oh! You make me so very angry!

202
00:20:17.375 --> 00:20:19.761
I need to speak
with you, Mr. Duck.

203
00:20:19.786 --> 00:20:21.987
As Assistant Assistant Manager,

204
00:20:21.988 --> 00:20:25.843
I feel it's my... duty

205
00:20:25.868 --> 00:20:30.272
to speak on behalf of all the
ironically named Lucky Duck employees.

206
00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:36.845
I've already, quote-unquote,
taken care of the others.

207
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.914
So, if there
isn't anything else...

208
00:20:38.939 --> 00:20:43.542
Well, sir, I'd like to take tomorrow
off so I can spend Christmas Day

209
00:20:43.543 --> 00:20:45.987
with my little daughter
Pricilla.

210
00:20:48.713 --> 00:20:50.642
What is it with you
and your daughter?

211
00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:52.985
You act like you're her father
or something.

212
00:20:52.986 --> 00:20:57.556
She's my little girl, sir, and,
well, with her mother gone,

213
00:20:57.557 --> 00:20:59.849
I'm all the family she has.

214
00:20:59.874 --> 00:21:03.505
Please, sir. Just show
a little Christmas spirit.

215
00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:07.676
I'd like to, Pig,
I really would.

216
00:21:07.701 --> 00:21:10.512
But how would it look
to the other employees?

217
00:21:10.537 --> 00:21:13.193
You can't always
be thinking of yourself.

218
00:21:15.294 --> 00:21:19.092
Now stop your sniveling and go
assistant-assistant manage something!

219
00:21:19.117 --> 00:21:22.357
We still have last minute
shoppers to exploit.

220
00:21:22.382 --> 00:21:26.561
But, sir, what do I tell
my little Pricilla?

221
00:21:27.671 --> 00:21:30.271
Tell her, bah, humduck!

222
00:22:33.715 --> 00:22:37.799
Who needs a white Christmas when
you can have a green one instead!

223
00:22:39.693 --> 00:22:42.761
Whoa! Time flies
when you're getting rich!

224
00:22:54.975 --> 00:22:57.555
It's a good thing
I don't pay overtime.

225
00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:00.355
Attention, Lucky Duck shoppers!

226
00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.794
For your convenience,

227
00:23:01.819 --> 00:23:05.331
<i>our store will reopen at 5:00 a.m.
on Christmas morning </i>

228
00:23:05.356 --> 00:23:07.596
<i>and will remain
open till midnight.</i>

229
00:23:07.621 --> 00:23:10.645
You owe your thanks to the
dedicated Lucky Duck employees

230
00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:12.571
who live to serve me.

231
00:23:14.281 --> 00:23:15.781
Uh, you.

232
00:23:20.905 --> 00:23:24.007
Hey, fuzz-face.
Don't forget to punch out.

233
00:23:30.506 --> 00:23:32.406
I asked for that.

234
00:23:38.919 --> 00:23:43.531
Merry Christmas, Mr.
Duck. See you in a few hours.

235
00:23:58.211 --> 00:24:00.715
<i>Three more ghosts.</i>

236
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:03.788
<i>Three more ghosts.</i>

237
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:19.190
Boo.

238
00:24:26.323 --> 00:24:28.806
You thought I was a...
Why are you still here?

239
00:24:28.831 --> 00:24:33.003
I'm still here because there's this
big snowdrift blocking the exit.

240
00:24:34.981 --> 00:24:39.120
That means I'm locked in here with
you till 5:00 in the morning.

241
00:24:39.145 --> 00:24:40.496
Look on the bright side.

242
00:24:40.521 --> 00:24:44.191
We can sing carols, make hot cider,
and string popcorn on the tree.

243
00:24:44.231 --> 00:24:46.887
I thought you said there
was a bright side.

244
00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:50.198
Hey, come on.
Don't you want some company?

245
00:24:50.223 --> 00:24:52.524
What with the ghosts
lurking around?

246
00:24:52.525 --> 00:24:55.561
Oh, what is with you
and this ghosts thing anyway?

247
00:24:55.562 --> 00:24:57.029
How do you know so much?

248
00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:58.554
I'm a holiday expert.

249
00:24:58.579 --> 00:25:00.718
I love them so much that I've
made it a point to learn

250
00:25:00.743 --> 00:25:03.044
everything there is
to know about them.

251
00:25:03.069 --> 00:25:04.514
For instance, did you know that

252
00:25:04.539 --> 00:25:08.101
poinsettias were originally
imported from Mexico? Hmm?

253
00:25:10.163 --> 00:25:12.487
Or that Santi Claus
was born in Turkey,

254
00:25:12.512 --> 00:25:14.913
which, of course,
is normally associated with...

255
00:25:14.914 --> 00:25:19.227
Stop! Say one more word
and I start splitting hairs!

256
00:25:22.476 --> 00:25:25.026
I'm gonna lock myself
in my office for the night

257
00:25:25.051 --> 00:25:26.743
and roll around in my money.

258
00:25:26.768 --> 00:25:30.572
Don't let anyone past you
who floats or says boo.

259
00:25:31.741 --> 00:25:33.008
Boo.

260
00:25:34.891 --> 00:25:38.711
Stupid long-eared bunny. "Santa
Claus originated from Turkey,

261
00:25:38.736 --> 00:25:41.235
"poinsettia imported
from Mexico..."

262
00:26:11.938 --> 00:26:14.973
A silver-haired septuagenarian
and a sparrow.

263
00:26:14.974 --> 00:26:17.652
How scary can they be?

264
00:26:17.677 --> 00:26:20.079
You've been a bad, bad birdy.

265
00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.624
You should be ashamed!

266
00:26:22.649 --> 00:26:23.867
Oh, please.

267
00:26:23.892 --> 00:26:26.899
If that's the best you've got...
Bad!

268
00:26:27.743 --> 00:26:29.064
Bad!

269
00:26:29.893 --> 00:26:31.126
Bad!

270
00:26:31.424 --> 00:26:34.027
Whoa there, silver fox mama!

271
00:26:34.409 --> 00:26:37.783
It's time for you to examine
your life, Mr. Duck,

272
00:26:37.808 --> 00:26:39.641
starting from the beginning.

273
00:26:39.666 --> 00:26:42.744
Let's take a stroll
down memory lane.

274
00:26:42.769 --> 00:26:44.703
What if I refuse?

275
00:26:46.734 --> 00:26:48.614
Lead on.

276
00:26:56.216 --> 00:26:58.817
The Lucky Duck Orphanage?

277
00:26:58.818 --> 00:27:01.162
This is my unhappy childhood.

278
00:27:01.187 --> 00:27:03.544
Am I a ghost, too?

279
00:27:03.569 --> 00:27:06.021
Not yet, but you're
working on it.

280
00:27:19.726 --> 00:27:21.358
Okay, little ones.

281
00:27:21.383 --> 00:27:25.289
It's time to meet your prospective
parents, so be on your best behavior.

282
00:27:25.333 --> 00:27:27.930
Oh! Oh! Pick me!

283
00:27:27.955 --> 00:27:31.359
My name is Daffy
and I'm special and colorful.

284
00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.030
I'm multi-talented.

285
00:27:36.055 --> 00:27:38.898
And I'm potty-trained!

286
00:27:38.923 --> 00:27:40.750
Uh, for the most part.

287
00:27:40.775 --> 00:27:44.907
And I'm smart and loving and I'm honest
and I'm trustworthy!

288
00:27:44.932 --> 00:27:46.751
And I'm... I'm...

289
00:27:49.603 --> 00:27:52.539
Alone. Just like
every Christmas.

290
00:27:54.076 --> 00:27:58.349
I'm sorry, Daffy, but at least you'll
get to spend another year here

291
00:27:58.374 --> 00:28:00.776
at the Lucky Duck Orphanage.

292
00:28:11.357 --> 00:28:13.292
I don't wanna stay here.

293
00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.795
I just want a family.

294
00:28:26.047 --> 00:28:29.984
Now I see how you came up with the
pathetically ironic name of your store.

295
00:28:30.009 --> 00:28:33.811
I can also see how you became the
nasty, selfish, cruel, cold-hearted,

296
00:28:33.836 --> 00:28:37.367
pathetically narcissistic, dirty
bad duck that you are today.

297
00:28:37.798 --> 00:28:39.827
Thanks. I think.

298
00:28:41.532 --> 00:28:44.766
That doesn't excuse you for ruining
Christmas for Porky's little daughter

299
00:28:44.791 --> 00:28:46.892
and all of your employees.

300
00:28:48.533 --> 00:28:51.904
Now, what have you learned from
your visit to Christmas past?

301
00:28:52.693 --> 00:28:57.212
That life is cruel and the only way to
survive is to be as selfish as possible?

302
00:28:58.167 --> 00:28:59.847
Try again.

303
00:28:59.872 --> 00:29:02.817
Before anyone gives me
another swat on the noggin,

304
00:29:02.842 --> 00:29:05.110
I have a proposition to make.

305
00:29:05.111 --> 00:29:06.745
We're listening.

306
00:29:06.746 --> 00:29:09.348
What say we use this
time-travel gimmick of yours

307
00:29:09.349 --> 00:29:12.117
to hit last night's
ninth race at the track?

308
00:29:12.118 --> 00:29:14.987
We put a boatload of money on a
long shot named Limpin' Larry

309
00:29:14.988 --> 00:29:16.989
and walk away rich, huh?

310
00:29:18.966 --> 00:29:21.005
He'll never change, Granny.

311
00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:31.158
That was despicable.

312
00:29:31.639 --> 00:29:33.839
<i>I hate to ruffle
your feathers, Mr. Duck,</i>

313
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.507
<i>but your 2:00 a.m.
appointment is here.</i>

314
00:29:35.508 --> 00:29:38.076
<i>A Mr. Ghost
of Christmas Present.</i>

315
00:29:38.101 --> 00:29:41.923
Oh, no! Not again! Not so soon!

316
00:29:51.903 --> 00:29:56.988
I'm the Ghost of Christmas Present, you
greedy little holiday-wrecking varmint!

317
00:29:57.848 --> 00:30:02.110
That's only part of who I am.
I'm actually quite complex.

318
00:30:02.135 --> 00:30:05.137
I'm just supposed to take you
on a little tour,

319
00:30:05.138 --> 00:30:08.373
but you're so lowdown,
I'm gonna whomp you first!

320
00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:12.420
Thanks for making me
feel special.

321
00:30:22.087 --> 00:30:26.558
Just for future reference, I'm not capable
of passing through solid objects.

322
00:30:26.559 --> 00:30:31.472
You're just not trying hard enough!
Grab onto my robe, varmint.

323
00:30:31.497 --> 00:30:33.231
Just don't let go.

324
00:30:37.746 --> 00:30:39.600
This is gonna hurt.

325
00:30:49.415 --> 00:30:51.535
I told you not to let go.

326
00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.895
Now look what your actions
has caused!

327
00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.954
Ah! A Fudd-sicle!

328
00:30:56.767 --> 00:31:00.024
There's a lot more to see,
you mangy varmint.

329
00:31:22.657 --> 00:31:24.438
Cheap holiday sentiment.

330
00:31:44.904 --> 00:31:48.974
Dragged through a toilet.
The final indignity.

331
00:31:48.975 --> 00:31:53.588
I begs to differ, critter.
This is the final indignity.

332
00:31:58.531 --> 00:32:01.956
So, tomorrow's Christmas.

333
00:32:01.988 --> 00:32:03.965
I'm so excited.

334
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:07.659
Do you think I'll get the Pretty
Pudgy Piggy doll I asked for?

335
00:32:08.711 --> 00:32:12.209
Gee, Pricilla, I... It's
the only thing on my list.

336
00:32:12.234 --> 00:32:15.076
And I've been really
good all year long.

337
00:32:15.101 --> 00:32:16.668
Yes, you have.

338
00:32:16.669 --> 00:32:19.650
You've been
the best daughter ever.

339
00:32:19.675 --> 00:32:23.401
Daddy? Why do you think
Mr. Duck is so mean?

340
00:32:23.919 --> 00:32:24.919
Uh...

341
00:32:24.944 --> 00:32:27.858
I think it's because he doesn't have
a family to spend Christmas with,

342
00:32:27.889 --> 00:32:29.959
like you and me.

343
00:32:37.729 --> 00:32:40.025
Look, that's the Christmas star.

344
00:32:40.026 --> 00:32:42.127
Make a wish
before you go to sleep.

345
00:32:42.128 --> 00:32:46.498
I wish for my Pretty Pudgy
Piggy doll, but even more,

346
00:32:46.499 --> 00:32:49.131
I wish my daddy didn't have to
go to work tomorrow

347
00:32:49.156 --> 00:32:51.901
so we could spend
Christmas Day together.

348
00:32:53.717 --> 00:32:55.651
Ditto.

349
00:33:11.691 --> 00:33:14.834
Why can't you just give the
sweet little thing her dolly?

350
00:33:14.859 --> 00:33:16.092
You don't need the money!

351
00:33:16.117 --> 00:33:19.231
You have a firm grasp
of guilt, Mr. Ghost,

352
00:33:19.256 --> 00:33:22.756
but you just don't understand
the first thing about greed.

353
00:33:23.168 --> 00:33:25.163
Why, you...

354
00:33:25.188 --> 00:33:28.720
How'd you like to ride back to
your office on the end of my foot?

355
00:33:28.745 --> 00:33:31.385
A lovely offer,
but I think I'll pass.

356
00:33:43.256 --> 00:33:46.091
♪ O Christmas tree,
O Christmas tree ♪

357
00:33:46.092 --> 00:33:49.170
♪ Thy candles
shine out brightly! ♪♪

358
00:33:55.479 --> 00:34:00.096
You look terrible. If I didn't know better,
I'd think you'd been beaten about the head

359
00:34:00.121 --> 00:34:02.517
with a candy cane,
dragged through the toilet,

360
00:34:02.542 --> 00:34:05.810
and kicked in the tail
feathers with a size 10 boot.

361
00:34:05.811 --> 00:34:07.779
That's not the half of it.

362
00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:09.714
I'm starting to crack, rabbit.

363
00:34:09.715 --> 00:34:12.498
Just a few minutes ago,
I was watching this little kid

364
00:34:12.523 --> 00:34:18.065
wishing on the Christmas star
and I almost felt... something.

365
00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:19.524
No. You?

366
00:34:19.525 --> 00:34:22.737
Does that mean you're willing
to mend your greedy ways?

367
00:34:22.762 --> 00:34:26.131
I said I felt something,
not insanity.

368
00:34:26.132 --> 00:34:30.402
Well, that's a shame, because I hear
the last ghost is a real doozy.

369
00:34:30.403 --> 00:34:32.537
Wait! There's another ghost?

370
00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:43.715
Well, that's my cue to leave.
Good luck in the afterworld.

371
00:34:44.699 --> 00:34:49.966
No! Please! Don't go! Hide me!
Please! Hide me!

372
00:34:49.991 --> 00:34:52.059
How can I possibly resist?

373
00:34:52.498 --> 00:34:53.690
Quick. In here.

374
00:34:57.096 --> 00:34:58.563
No, in here.

375
00:35:02.749 --> 00:35:03.749
Too obvious.

376
00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.014
In here.

377
00:35:11.577 --> 00:35:13.541
This is just too easy.

378
00:35:13.566 --> 00:35:15.677
I know. Over here.

379
00:35:28.398 --> 00:35:31.146
Duck!

380
00:35:31.171 --> 00:35:32.406
Mummy.

381
00:35:36.205 --> 00:35:40.114
Listen, Mr. Ghost, I'm not sure
exactly what you're after...

382
00:35:40.139 --> 00:35:42.165
You!

383
00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:44.291
I don't know what they're paying
you down at the ghost company,

384
00:35:44.316 --> 00:35:46.881
but whatever it is,
I'll triple it!

385
00:35:58.858 --> 00:36:01.393
Where are we?

386
00:36:01.394 --> 00:36:04.489
Christmas future.

387
00:36:04.514 --> 00:36:07.842
Try that again
and this time, enunciate.

388
00:36:09.869 --> 00:36:12.827
Christmas future!

389
00:36:17.343 --> 00:36:19.911
Well, I don't mean to tell you
your business, mumbles,

390
00:36:19.936 --> 00:36:22.177
but I think you've got
the wrong holiday.

391
00:36:22.202 --> 00:36:25.617
This place has a distinctly
Halloweeny vibe to it.

392
00:36:31.657 --> 00:36:34.325
Who's the stiff
taking a dirt nap?

393
00:36:40.533 --> 00:36:42.667
Mr. Daffy
Duck never had a family,

394
00:36:42.668 --> 00:36:44.599
or friends for that matter.

395
00:36:44.624 --> 00:36:47.748
But maybe now he'll finally
get what he always wanted.

396
00:36:47.773 --> 00:36:51.342
To be alone
with his money, forever.

397
00:36:52.186 --> 00:36:54.722
Surely I did
some good for others.

398
00:36:54.747 --> 00:36:58.383
I know, I provided them
with gainful employment.

399
00:36:58.384 --> 00:37:01.453
Daffy tried to leave his store
to himself in his will,

400
00:37:01.454 --> 00:37:03.288
which, of course, is illegal.

401
00:37:03.289 --> 00:37:08.021
As a result, Lucky Duck has been
closed and we're all out of jobs.

402
00:37:08.896 --> 00:37:11.238
But for the first time in years,

403
00:37:11.263 --> 00:37:14.275
we can all spend Christmas
with our families.

404
00:37:15.944 --> 00:37:18.212
Good-bye, Mr. Duck.

405
00:37:18.237 --> 00:37:22.006
Or as you liked
to say, bah, humduck.

406
00:37:29.448 --> 00:37:31.659
Please! Do something!

407
00:37:35.221 --> 00:37:38.899
I don't wanna end up
lonely and alone.

408
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:43.871
Now, that was just plain rude.

409
00:37:45.107 --> 00:37:48.836
Mr. Daffy? I know
everybody hated you.

410
00:37:48.861 --> 00:37:50.945
But I never hated you.

411
00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:55.070
Because I know as much
as anyone how sad and angry

412
00:37:55.095 --> 00:37:58.591
it can make a person to be
without family at the holidays.

413
00:37:59.936 --> 00:38:02.490
So, if you're up there watching,

414
00:38:02.515 --> 00:38:05.232
or down there, in your case,
I want you to know that

415
00:38:05.257 --> 00:38:08.763
you don't have to be
one anymore.

416
00:38:08.788 --> 00:38:12.505
'Cause from now on, every
Christmas, I'll come visit you.

417
00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:17.138
In case you don't know, it's the one day
of the year when everyone is family.

418
00:38:17.163 --> 00:38:19.836
I made you
some Christmas cookies.

419
00:38:19.861 --> 00:38:22.325
Merry Christmas, Mr. Duck.

420
00:38:32.478 --> 00:38:35.647
You know, mumbles,
I said I was sorry before.

421
00:38:35.648 --> 00:38:37.515
But now I really am.

422
00:38:41.384 --> 00:38:43.931
Can I please have second chance?

423
00:38:45.963 --> 00:38:47.997
Go!

424
00:38:59.672 --> 00:39:01.940
I'm alive! I'm okay!

425
00:39:01.941 --> 00:39:04.952
More importantly,
I'm a changed duck,

426
00:39:04.977 --> 00:39:07.478
filled with the spirit
of giving!

427
00:39:13.087 --> 00:39:15.930
Fudd, Fudd? Thaw, Fudd! Thaw!

428
00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:19.858
What day is it?

429
00:39:19.883 --> 00:39:21.569
Christmas Day.

430
00:39:21.594 --> 00:39:24.004
Then I haven't missed it.

431
00:39:24.029 --> 00:39:28.366
I'm giving you a raise and a
month-long vacation in sunny Hawaii!

432
00:39:29.468 --> 00:39:32.514
But first, we've got
work to do. Come on!

433
00:39:32.982 --> 00:39:36.967
It's time to save Christmas!

434
00:39:52.424 --> 00:39:54.959
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!

435
00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.064
Marvin!

436
00:39:56.089 --> 00:39:59.526
I bought you a rocket so you
can fly home for the holidays!

437
00:39:59.551 --> 00:40:03.377
If you travel at the speed of light,
you should make it by yesterday!

438
00:40:03.402 --> 00:40:06.471
Oh! You make me very happy!

439
00:40:07.585 --> 00:40:09.922
You'll never be
hungry again, Coyote.

440
00:40:09.947 --> 00:40:12.786
I'm hiring you
your own personal chef!

441
00:40:16.148 --> 00:40:20.416
Hey, Speedy!
Merry Christmas!

442
00:40:20.441 --> 00:40:23.535
Or as they say in your
country, fleas and eggnog!

443
00:40:24.764 --> 00:40:26.068
Eh, it's close enough.

444
00:40:26.093 --> 00:40:29.503
A Pretty Pudgy Piggy doll
for the pretty, pretty piggy.

445
00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:34.441
And Pretty Pudgy
Piggy doll accessories,

446
00:40:34.466 --> 00:40:36.714
complete with Pretty Pudgy
Piggy doll pony

447
00:40:36.739 --> 00:40:39.137
and Pretty Pudgy Piggy doll
dream house.

448
00:40:39.138 --> 00:40:43.968
And that's not all! I'm giving your
dad, I mean my new store manager,

449
00:40:43.993 --> 00:40:48.819
and all my other loyal employees
a raise and a paid vacation!

450
00:40:48.844 --> 00:40:50.991
Are you okay, sir?

451
00:40:51.016 --> 00:40:53.084
I'm better than okay.

452
00:40:53.085 --> 00:40:56.554
After all these years
of greed and selfishness,

453
00:40:56.555 --> 00:41:00.370
I finally feel like...
A lucky duck!

454
00:41:00.395 --> 00:41:01.862
It's a miracle, Daddy.

455
00:41:01.887 --> 00:41:05.187
Yes, dear, a miracle.

456
00:41:25.946 --> 00:41:29.863
Sir, I know you don't have
a regular family,

457
00:41:29.888 --> 00:41:33.524
but today, we'd like you
to be a part of ours.

458
00:41:33.525 --> 00:41:37.662
In case you don't know, that's what
Christmas is all about, Mr. Duck.

459
00:41:39.459 --> 00:41:41.015
Aw.

460
00:41:41.428 --> 00:41:45.612
I say... I say, son...

461
00:41:47.428 --> 00:41:48.916
Huh?

462
00:42:03.289 --> 00:42:07.034
Presents, cash bonuses,
improved health coverage.

463
00:42:07.059 --> 00:42:09.024
I'm gonna go broke!

464
00:42:09.847 --> 00:42:13.574
I gotta think of a strategy
to reverse the situation.

465
00:42:13.599 --> 00:42:15.767
Should I steal back
all the presents?

466
00:42:15.768 --> 00:42:17.602
Should I cut
everyone's salaries?

467
00:42:17.603 --> 00:42:19.637
I gotta concentrate.

468
00:42:20.434 --> 00:42:23.742
Excuse me, sir.
Would you like a cookie?

469
00:42:29.915 --> 00:42:32.559
Merry Christmas, Uncle Daffy.

470
00:42:32.584 --> 00:42:35.431
Uncle? Well, that may be
pushing it a little...

471
00:42:36.792 --> 00:42:39.048
Okay. Uncle Daffy it is.

472
00:42:43.629 --> 00:42:47.298
The varmint did it.
He plum turned hisself around.

473
00:42:47.299 --> 00:42:52.012
Ghost of Christmas
Yet to Come happy.

474
00:42:55.149 --> 00:42:57.117
Everyone, can I have
your attention?

475
00:42:57.142 --> 00:43:01.109
I want to propose
a toast to Mr. Daffy, the...

476
00:43:01.134 --> 00:43:04.291
The greatest boss ever.

477
00:43:04.316 --> 00:43:06.150
Merry Christmas!

478
00:43:12.291 --> 00:43:14.859
Don't you just love
the holidays?

479
00:43:25.118 --> 00:43:27.021
That's all, folks!
