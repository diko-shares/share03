Merry Christmas, everybody.

4
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.619
I know rabbits are normally
associated with Easter,

5
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.389
but me, I'm all about
the winter holidays.

6
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.992
If you ask me, there's no better time
to come out of your own little hole

7
00:02:05.993 --> 00:02:11.698
and celebrate the spirit of
giving with everybody you see.

8
00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:23.310
Hey!

9
00:02:23.311 --> 00:02:28.282
Watch where you point
that thing, you big palooka!

10
00:02:43.697 --> 00:02:47.335
Good morning, Mr. Duck.

11
00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:55.709
I told that pig to be here.

12
00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:11.291
What do I look like? An ATM?

13
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.394
Why is it around the holidays

14
00:03:14.395 --> 00:03:21.768
every vagrant thinks they're
entitled to hit up hardworking businessmen?

15
00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.938
Hey, doc, that's no way
to treat those less fortunate.

16
00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:28.308
Where's your sense
of holiday spirit?

17
00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:34.947
Who asked you
to butt in, long-ears?

20
00:03:41.922 --> 00:03:43.590
Happy holidays, Mr. Duck.

21
00:03:43.591 --> 00:03:47.360
We're collecting donations
for needy families.

22
00:03:47.361 --> 00:03:49.629
Well, that's an interesting spin

23
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.666
on trespassing, pandering,
and illegal solicitation!

24
00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:59.740
Scram, before I send
you all to elf prison!

25
00:04:05.145 --> 00:04:08.881
Now, that's the kind of holiday
jingle I like to hear!

26
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.918
Talk about easy money.

Thank you for watching
my bucket, Mr. Duck.

33
00:05:05.105 --> 00:05:07.707
Security! Security!
I've been robbed!

34
00:05:07.708 --> 00:05:16.182
Security! Get over here
and step on it!

35
00:05:38.138 --> 00:05:39.706
Note to self.

36
00:05:39.707 --> 00:05:45.446
Choose words carefully when
berating the security guy.

37
00:06:05.633 --> 00:06:11.037
Attention, everybody, it's
the busiest day of the year.

38
00:06:14.908 --> 00:06:18.612
No eating on the job, Coyote.

39
00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:34.594
Wake up and smell
the coffee, Fudd!

40
00:06:34.595 --> 00:06:43.335
What does he think
this is, a holiday?

41
00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:52.411
Home sweet home. How I
miss you at the holidays.

42
00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:57.216
Stop daydreaming, space boy.

43
00:07:00.588 --> 00:07:02.822
And triple the price
on everything.

44
00:07:02.823 --> 00:07:08.095
Parents are suckers
this time of year.

45
00:07:18.506 --> 00:07:24.611
You have no need pour le
parfume, my Christmas kitty.

46
00:07:24.612 --> 00:07:30.917
You smell of the sweetest garden
in the bloom of the spring.

47
00:07:30.918 --> 00:07:35.588
Hey, Casanova, that's not what I meant
when I said "woo the customers."

48
00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:38.725
Watch the master.

49
00:07:38.726 --> 00:07:40.827
Take my advice, tuna breath.

50
00:07:40.828 --> 00:07:52.104
Buy a quart of the expensive
stuff and gargle with it.

51
00:07:53.041 --> 00:07:58.478
Hello, my sweet,
you are new, non?

52
00:08:07.387 --> 00:08:08.888
Merry Christmas, Senor Duck.

53
00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:12.692
Or as they say in my country,
Feliz Navidad!

54
00:08:12.693 --> 00:08:15.161
Tonto.

55
00:08:15.162 --> 00:08:17.764
What did you call me?

56
00:08:17.765 --> 00:08:22.635
Tonto. It means, uh,
"genius" in Spanish.

57
00:08:22.636 --> 00:08:28.841
Well, in that case, I guess I'm
the biggest tonto in the world.

58
00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:30.977
Finally. A little respect.

59
00:08:30.978 --> 00:08:34.213
Now where's that assistant
manager gone this time?

60
00:08:34.214 --> 00:08:36.182
Mr. Assistant Manager?

61
00:08:36.183 --> 00:08:38.751
Move it, lazybones!

62
00:08:38.752 --> 00:08:41.520
Assistant Manager Porky Pig
reporting for…

63
00:08:42.656 --> 00:08:44.757
For service, sir.

64
00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:49.028
Nice footwork, twinkle hooves.

65
00:09:07.414 --> 00:09:09.949
Mr. Assistant Manager,

66
00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:16.555
your boss wants to see
your butt this instant!

67
00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:25.331
Be careful what you ask for.

68
00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:02.334
Eh, what's up, duck?

69
00:10:02.335 --> 00:10:04.370
Care for a candy cane?

70
00:10:04.371 --> 00:10:07.239
Stop snacking
on store merchandise, mister,

71
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:11.610
or I'll see to it that
you're arrested for stealing.

72
00:10:13.881 --> 00:10:17.083
You might wanna stay away from the
"s" words until you work through

73
00:10:17.084 --> 00:10:19.218
that little spitting problem
of yours.

74
00:10:19.219 --> 00:10:21.721
M-M-M-Maybe you could
see a speech…

75
00:10:23.323 --> 00:10:25.091
specialist.

76
00:10:25.092 --> 00:10:29.595
You are demoted to Assistant
Assistant Manager.

77
00:10:30.931 --> 00:10:34.033
And you are messing
with the wrong duck, mister.

78
00:10:34.034 --> 00:10:47.513
Well, I guess I could just take my
last minute shopping list elsewhere.

79
00:10:47.514 --> 00:10:52.384
We rabbits are very "prodigical" when
it comes to having big families.

80
00:10:52.385 --> 00:10:55.487
I've never liked families.
But I do love money.

81
00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:59.358
So shop till you drop, and don't
forget to pay for the candy canes!

82
00:10:59.359 --> 00:11:00.459
Oh, I intend to, Duck.

83
00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.394
But before I make
my final purchases,

84
00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:05.497
I'm gonna need a second
opinion on a few items.

85
00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:06.899
I don't have the time to…

86
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.467
What about these earmuffs
for my aunt Bunny

87
00:11:08.468 --> 00:11:11.237
and these ski goggles
for my cousin Franz?

88
00:11:11.238 --> 00:11:14.273
How about this magic fairy dress-up
costume for my niece Betty?

89
00:11:14.274 --> 00:11:16.776
And how about this pacifier
for Baby Bunny?

90
00:11:16.777 --> 00:11:20.747
And this bowling ball
for my uncle Peter?

91
00:11:22.315 --> 00:11:27.553
Okay. Fun's over.

92
00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:32.424
You… You…

93
00:11:32.425 --> 00:11:34.827
Customer or no customer,
get out of my sight!

94
00:11:34.828 --> 00:11:37.463
Out! Out! Out!

95
00:11:37.464 --> 00:11:39.198
For shame. For shame.

96
00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:42.568
Has your holiday spirit
flown south for the winter?

97
00:11:42.569 --> 00:11:46.538
In case you haven't noticed,

98
00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:49.275
I hate the holidays!

99
00:11:49.276 --> 00:11:54.513
You don't say?
Well, bah, humduck!

100
00:11:54.514 --> 00:11:57.616
"Bah, humduck"? I like that!

101
00:11:57.617 --> 00:12:00.219
Bah, humduck.

102
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.721
If I were you,
I'd be careful, Duck.

103
00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:06.558
Bad things happen to people
who mess with Christmas.

104
00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:08.327
Oh, yeah? Like what?

105
00:12:08.328 --> 00:12:13.065
Well, if they're really bad,
and I think you fit the bill,

106
00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:17.736
they get visited
by the ghosts of Christmas.

107
00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:22.842
I'm not afraid of ghosts. In fact,
I'm not afraid of anything.

108
00:12:22.843 --> 00:12:26.979
Except perhaps low quarterly profit
projections and personal intimacy.

109
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:32.251
So again I say, bah, humduck!

110
00:12:45.498 --> 00:12:49.168
Sir, now that you've finished
with your daily…

111
00:12:50.403 --> 00:12:53.739
abuse, I was wondering
if I could ask a favor.

112
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.108
Do I know you?
Y-Y-Y-Yes, sir.

113
00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:59.445
I'm your Assistant
Assistant Manager.

114
00:12:59.446 --> 00:13:01.914
Do I like you?

115
00:13:01.915 --> 00:13:08.654
You don't really
like anyone, sir.

116
00:13:08.655 --> 00:13:10.789
I remember you now.

117
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.759
And you're right,
I don't like you.

118
00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.663
That said, sir, I've worked
very hard for you all year long

119
00:13:17.664 --> 00:13:20.266
and well, my daughter Pricilla,

120
00:13:20.267 --> 00:13:23.102
really, really wants that Pretty
Pudgy Piggy doll for Christmas.

121
00:13:23.103 --> 00:13:24.536
It's all she talks about, sir.

122
00:13:24.537 --> 00:13:27.039
She's my only daughter
and I love her so much.

123
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.275
I really would like
to buy it for her.

124
00:13:29.276 --> 00:13:32.912
But since you tripled
the price, I can't afford it.

125
00:13:32.913 --> 00:13:36.382
Can't afford it, huh?
What if you stopped eating?

126
00:13:36.383 --> 00:13:38.617
I don't eat much as it is, sir.

127
00:13:38.618 --> 00:13:40.152
I can't on my salary.

128
00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:45.457
Then how do you explain
the big pink gut, pork chop?

129
00:13:45.458 --> 00:13:47.026
Uh, I'm a pig, sir.

130
00:13:47.027 --> 00:13:50.362
You said it, I didn't.
Oh, uh, please, sir!

131
00:13:50.363 --> 00:13:51.530
It's the…

132
00:13:52.632 --> 00:13:54.066
It's…

133
00:13:54.067 --> 00:13:56.869
Hold that thought.

134
00:13:58.071 --> 00:14:02.641
But it's Christmas.

135
00:14:08.916 --> 00:14:10.282
Hmm.

136
00:14:10.283 --> 00:14:14.586
Profits are good,
but we could do better.

137
00:14:14.587 --> 00:14:18.624
What do you think,
hovering cat guy?

138
00:14:21.794 --> 00:14:23.562
Yikes!

139
00:14:23.563 --> 00:14:27.233
Do my eyes deceive me
or am I being visited by…

140
00:14:27.234 --> 00:14:32.471
Sylvester the Cat.
Alias Sylvester the investor.

141
00:14:32.472 --> 00:14:37.109
Unscrupulous CEO of the super-successful
Cat's Meow Superstores.

142
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.745
You. You were my idol,

143
00:14:39.746 --> 00:14:41.813
my inspiration.

144
00:14:41.814 --> 00:14:43.082
Say, you're…

145
00:14:43.083 --> 00:14:46.652
Deceased? A spirit? A ghost?

146
00:14:46.653 --> 00:14:48.220
Why, yes, I am.

147
00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:51.523
I have been so since
last Christmas Eve

148
00:14:51.524 --> 00:14:57.563
when a disgruntled employee
squashed me with a forklift.

149
00:14:57.564 --> 00:14:59.098
Nine times.

150
00:15:00.667 --> 00:15:04.536
That's what I said. But it was
a fitting end for me, Duck.

151
00:15:04.537 --> 00:15:07.439
You see, I was like you.

152
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.943
Small-minded, selfish,
and seriously greedy.

153
00:15:10.944 --> 00:15:18.784
And if you don't change your ways,
you'll end up just like yours truly.

154
00:15:18.785 --> 00:15:20.519
Not a chance.

155
00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.289
I'd never be stupid enough to
buy my employees a forklift.

156
00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.091
You're missing the point.

157
00:15:25.092 --> 00:15:27.493
You need to start putting
other people's needs

158
00:15:27.494 --> 00:15:34.866
in front of the almighty dollar.

159
00:15:40.207 --> 00:15:42.941
Yes. It's going
to hurt at first.

160
00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:45.177
But it's your only hope.

161
00:15:45.178 --> 00:15:47.246
Before the night is through,

162
00:15:47.247 --> 00:15:51.683
you'll be visited
by three more ghosts.

163
00:15:51.684 --> 00:15:54.686
Each more terrifying
than the last.

164
00:15:54.687 --> 00:15:58.457
Each on a quest
for your very soul!

165
00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:02.461
Change, Daffy.
Before it's too late.

166
00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:06.065
Wait a minute. This is some kind of trick.
Who put you up to this?

167
00:16:06.066 --> 00:16:08.734
Was it the rabbit? Or did
my subordinates hire you

168
00:16:08.735 --> 00:16:11.803
to scare me into treating them
with some dignity?

169
00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:13.139
You're doomed.

170
00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:21.480
Doomed!

171
00:16:23.683 --> 00:16:24.783
What's up, Duck?

172
00:16:31.024 --> 00:16:32.924
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

173
00:16:32.925 --> 00:16:34.593
What are you doing here?

174
00:16:34.594 --> 00:16:36.695
I asked the little guy
in the helmet downstairs

175
00:16:36.696 --> 00:16:40.632
if he knew of any cheap skates
and he sent me up here.

176
00:16:40.633 --> 00:16:56.948
Out! Out! Out!

177
00:17:03.256 --> 00:17:07.526
I'm okay. I'm all right.

178
00:17:12.499 --> 00:17:14.066
Beep beep!

179
00:17:14.067 --> 00:17:16.435
There's something
about that sound you make.

180
00:17:16.436 --> 00:17:34.920
It just plain jangles my nerves.

181
00:17:34.921 --> 00:17:38.957
Ouch!

182
00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:45.097
Well, looky here. It's a
Christmas present just for me.

183
00:17:45.098 --> 00:17:53.705
And it's from
my favorite person. Me.

184
00:17:55.275 --> 00:18:00.779
My very own Task-Master 7000
Smart Office Remote.

185
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:17.028
Thank you, me.

186
00:18:40.887 --> 00:18:46.958
Huh?

187
00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:48.760
What is it, Fudd?

188
00:18:53.666 --> 00:18:57.936
Ouch!

189
00:18:57.937 --> 00:18:59.938
Well, what is it, Fudd?

190
00:19:01.374 --> 00:19:03.309
Sorry to bother you, sir,

191
00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:08.079
but I've worked 37 straight
triple shifts, Mr. Duck.

192
00:19:12.185 --> 00:19:14.486
Yeah, yeah, get on with it.

193
00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:16.388
I'm delirious, sir.

194
00:19:16.389 --> 00:19:19.591
I can't keep my eyes open.

195
00:19:21.594 --> 00:19:30.369
Drink espresso. Pinch yourself.
Just get back to work!

196
00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:32.838
Who does he think he…

197
00:19:44.617 --> 00:19:47.419
I am so very
homesick, Mr. Duck.

198
00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:48.820
Well, get back to work.

199
00:19:48.821 --> 00:19:52.123
But it's Christmas Eve
and I miss my family.

200
00:19:52.124 --> 00:19:57.529
I long to hang garland on the
laser annihilator cannon.

201
00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:01.166
Okay, I think I can arrange it.

202
00:20:01.167 --> 00:20:03.068
Oh, goodie, goodie.

203
00:20:03.069 --> 00:20:08.340
Bon voyage, space boy.

204
00:20:08.341 --> 00:20:11.877
Oh! You make me so very angry!

205
00:20:16.816 --> 00:20:19.318
I need to speak
with you, Mr. Duck.

206
00:20:19.319 --> 00:20:21.487
As Assistant Assistant Manager,

207
00:20:21.488 --> 00:20:25.090
I feel it's my… duty

208
00:20:25.091 --> 00:20:31.997
to speak on behalf of all the
ironically named Lucky Duck employees.

209
00:20:31.998 --> 00:20:36.535
I've already, quote-unquote,
taken care of the others.

210
00:20:36.536 --> 00:20:38.270
So, if there
isn't anything else…

211
00:20:38.271 --> 00:20:43.141
Well, sir, I'd like to take tomorrow
off so I can spend Christmas Day

212
00:20:43.142 --> 00:20:48.314
with my little daughter
Pricilla.

213
00:20:48.315 --> 00:20:49.948
What is it with you
and your daughter?

214
00:20:49.949 --> 00:20:52.451
You act like you're her father
or something.

215
00:20:52.452 --> 00:20:57.155
She's my little girl, sir, and,
well, with her mother gone,

216
00:20:57.156 --> 00:20:59.758
I'm all the family she has.

217
00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:03.429
Please, sir. Just show
a little Christmas spirit.

218
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:07.566
I'd like to, Pig,
I really would.

219
00:21:07.567 --> 00:21:09.868
But how would it look
to the other employees?

220
00:21:09.869 --> 00:21:13.772
You can't always
be thinking of yourself.

221
00:21:15.308 --> 00:21:18.577
Now stop your sniveling and go
assistant-assistant manage something!

222
00:21:18.578 --> 00:21:21.747
We still have last minute
shoppers to exploit.

223
00:21:21.748 --> 00:21:27.319
But, sir, what do I tell
my little Pricilla?

224
00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:31.691
Tell her, bah, humduck!

225
00:22:32.719 --> 00:22:37.923
Who needs a white Christmas when
you can have a green one instead!

226
00:22:38.958 --> 00:22:54.406
Whoa! Time flies
when you're getting rich!

227
00:22:54.407 --> 00:22:56.942
It's a good thing
I don't pay overtime.

228
00:22:56.943 --> 00:22:59.711
Attention, Lucky Duck shoppers!

229
00:22:59.712 --> 00:23:01.613
For your convenience,

230
00:23:01.614 --> 00:23:04.616
our store will reopen at 5:00 a.m.
on Christmas morning

231
00:23:04.617 --> 00:23:06.852
and will remain open
till midnight.

232
00:23:06.853 --> 00:23:10.155
You owe your thanks to the
dedicated Lucky Duck employees

233
00:23:10.156 --> 00:23:13.459
who live to serve me.

234
00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:16.261
Uh, you.

235
00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:26.773
Hey, fuzz-face.
Don't forget to punch out.

236
00:23:30.309 --> 00:23:38.349
I asked for that.

237
00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:43.889
Merry Christmas, Mr.
Duck. See you in a few hours.

238
00:23:57.637 --> 00:24:00.572
Three more ghosts.

239
00:24:00.573 --> 00:24:11.416
Three more ghosts.

240
00:24:17.557 --> 00:24:25.063
Boo.

241
00:24:26.165 --> 00:24:28.266
You thought I was a…
Why are you still here?

242
00:24:28.267 --> 00:24:34.372
I'm still here because there's this
big snowdrift blocking the exit.

243
00:24:34.373 --> 00:24:38.677
That means I'm locked in here with
you till 5:00 in the morning.

244
00:24:38.678 --> 00:24:40.378
Look on the bright side.

245
00:24:40.379 --> 00:24:43.882
We can sing carols, make hot cider,
and string popcorn on the tree.

246
00:24:43.883 --> 00:24:47.085
I thought you said
there was a bright side.

247
00:24:47.086 --> 00:24:49.755
Hey, come on.
Don't you want some company?

248
00:24:49.756 --> 00:24:51.990
What with the ghosts
lurking around?

249
00:24:51.991 --> 00:24:55.226
Oh, what is with you
and this ghosts thing anyway?

250
00:24:55.227 --> 00:24:56.595
How do you know so much?

251
00:24:56.596 --> 00:24:58.096
I'm a holiday expert.

252
00:24:58.097 --> 00:25:00.498
I love them so much that I've
made it a point to learn

253
00:25:00.499 --> 00:25:02.568
everything there is
to know about them.

254
00:25:02.569 --> 00:25:04.002
For instance, did you know that

255
00:25:04.003 --> 00:25:09.708
poinsettias were originally
imported from Mexico? Hmm?

256
00:25:09.709 --> 00:25:11.910
Or that Santi Claus
was born in Turkey,

257
00:25:11.911 --> 00:25:14.245
which, of course,
is normally associated with…

258
00:25:14.246 --> 00:25:21.987
Stop! Say one more word
and I start splitting hairs!

259
00:25:21.988 --> 00:25:24.489
I'm gonna lock myself
in my office for the night

260
00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:26.124
and roll around in my money.

261
00:25:26.125 --> 00:25:31.396
Don't let anyone past you
who floats or says boo.

262
00:25:31.397 --> 00:25:32.530
Boo.

263
00:25:34.333 --> 00:25:38.203
Stupid long-eared bunny. "Santa
Claus originated from Turkey,

264
00:25:38.204 --> 00:25:42.073
"poinsettia imported
from Mexico…"

265
00:26:11.237 --> 00:26:14.906
A silver-haired septuagenarian
and a sparrow.

266
00:26:14.907 --> 00:26:16.842
How scary can they be?

267
00:26:16.843 --> 00:26:19.811
You've been a bad, bad birdy.

268
00:26:19.812 --> 00:26:22.180
You should be ashamed!

269
00:26:22.181 --> 00:26:23.381
Oh, please.

270
00:26:23.382 --> 00:26:27.452
If that's the best you've got…
Bad!

271
00:26:27.453 --> 00:26:29.921
Bad!

272
00:26:29.922 --> 00:26:30.890
Bad!

273
00:26:30.891 --> 00:26:34.025
Whoa there, silver fox mama!

274
00:26:34.026 --> 00:26:37.128
It's time for you to examine
your life, Mr. Duck,

275
00:26:37.129 --> 00:26:39.130
starting from the beginning.

276
00:26:39.131 --> 00:26:42.300
Let's take a stroll
down memory lane.

277
00:26:42.301 --> 00:26:46.304
What if I refuse?

278
00:26:46.305 --> 00:26:55.647
Lead on.

279
00:26:55.648 --> 00:26:58.516
The Lucky Duck Orphanage?

280
00:26:58.517 --> 00:27:00.618
This is my unhappy childhood.

281
00:27:00.619 --> 00:27:02.821
Am I a ghost, too?

282
00:27:02.822 --> 00:27:19.470
Not yet, but you're
working on it.

283
00:27:19.471 --> 00:27:21.472
Okay, little ones.

284
00:27:21.473 --> 00:27:25.210
It's time to meet your prospective
parents, so be on your best behavior.

285
00:27:25.211 --> 00:27:27.478
Oh! Oh! Pick me!

286
00:27:27.479 --> 00:27:33.651
My name is Daffy
and I'm special and colorful.

287
00:27:33.652 --> 00:27:35.687
I'm multi-talented.

288
00:27:35.688 --> 00:27:38.656
And I'm potty-trained!

289
00:27:38.657 --> 00:27:40.425
Uh, for the most part.

290
00:27:40.426 --> 00:27:44.362
And I'm smart and loving and I'm
honest and I'm trustworthy!

291
00:27:44.363 --> 00:27:48.867
And I'm… I'm…

292
00:27:48.868 --> 00:27:53.604
Alone. Just like
every Christmas.

293
00:27:53.605 --> 00:27:57.809
I'm sorry, Daffy, but at least you'll
get to spend another year here

294
00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:04.549
at the Lucky Duck Orphanage.

295
00:28:10.689 --> 00:28:12.623
I don't want to stay here.

296
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:21.366
I just want a family.

297
00:28:25.304 --> 00:28:28.306
Now I see how you came up with
the pathetically ironic name

298
00:28:28.307 --> 00:28:30.075
of your store.

299
00:28:30.076 --> 00:28:32.410
I can also see how you became the
nasty, selfish, cruel, cold-hearted,

300
00:28:32.411 --> 00:28:37.448
pathetically narcissistic, dirty
bad duck that you are today.

301
00:28:37.449 --> 00:28:39.284
Thanks. I think.

302
00:28:39.285 --> 00:28:44.022
That doesn't excuse you for ruining
Christmas for Porky's little daughter

303
00:28:44.023 --> 00:28:47.725
and all of your employees.

304
00:28:47.726 --> 00:28:51.696
Now, what have you learned from
your visit to Christmas past?

305
00:28:51.697 --> 00:28:57.602
That life is cruel and the only way to
survive is to be as selfish as possible?

306
00:28:57.603 --> 00:28:59.470
Try again.

307
00:28:59.471 --> 00:29:02.007
Before anyone gives me
another swat on the noggin,

308
00:29:02.008 --> 00:29:04.442
I have a proposition to make.

309
00:29:04.443 --> 00:29:05.944
We're listening.

310
00:29:05.945 --> 00:29:08.413
What say we use this
time-travel gimmick of yours

311
00:29:08.414 --> 00:29:11.249
to hit last night's
ninth race at the track?

312
00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:14.152
We put a boatload of money on a
long shot named Limpin' Larry

313
00:29:14.153 --> 00:29:18.023
and walk away rich, huh?

314
00:29:18.024 --> 00:29:24.629
He'll never change, Granny.

315
00:29:27.766 --> 00:29:30.668
That was despicable.

316
00:29:30.669 --> 00:29:32.670
I hate to ruffle
your feathers, Mr. Duck,

317
00:29:32.671 --> 00:29:34.572
but your 2:00 a.m.
appointment is here.

318
00:29:34.573 --> 00:29:37.708
A Mr. Ghost
of Christmas Present.

319
00:29:37.709 --> 00:29:42.513
Oh, no! Not again!
Not so soon!

320
00:29:51.457 --> 00:29:53.925
I'm the Ghost
of Christmas Present,

321
00:29:53.926 --> 00:29:57.462
you greedy little
holiday-wrecking varmint!

322
00:29:57.463 --> 00:30:01.666
That's only part of who I am.
I'm actually quite complex.

323
00:30:01.667 --> 00:30:04.870
I'm just supposed to take you
on a little tour,

324
00:30:04.871 --> 00:30:09.540
but you're so lowdown,
I'm gonna whomp you first!

325
00:30:09.541 --> 00:30:12.743
Thanks for making me
feel special.

326
00:30:21.687 --> 00:30:23.288
Just for future reference,

327
00:30:23.289 --> 00:30:26.357
I'm not capable of passing
through solid objects.

328
00:30:26.358 --> 00:30:31.362
You're just not trying hard enough!
Grab onto my robe, varmint.

329
00:30:31.363 --> 00:30:37.768
Just don't let go.

330
00:30:37.769 --> 00:30:39.570
This is gonna hurt.

331
00:30:49.115 --> 00:30:51.382
I told you not to let go.

332
00:30:51.383 --> 00:30:53.551
Now look what your actions
has caused!

333
00:30:53.552 --> 00:30:56.387
Ah! A Fudd-sicle!

334
00:30:56.388 --> 00:31:18.709
There's a lot more to see,
you mangy varmint.

335
00:31:22.014 --> 00:31:24.482
Cheap holiday sentiment.

336
00:31:44.303 --> 00:31:48.506
Dragged through a toilet.
The final indignity.

337
00:31:48.507 --> 00:31:53.411
I begs to differ, critter.
This is the final indignity.

338
00:31:58.951 --> 00:32:01.786
So, tomorrow's Christmas.

339
00:32:01.787 --> 00:32:03.621
I'm so excited.

340
00:32:03.622 --> 00:32:07.392
Do you think I'll get the Pretty
Pudgy Piggy doll I asked for?

341
00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.596
Gee, Pricilla, I… It's
the only thing on my list.

342
00:32:11.597 --> 00:32:14.765
And I've been
really good all year long.

343
00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:16.201
Yes, you have.

344
00:32:16.202 --> 00:32:20.305
You've been
the best daughter ever.

345
00:32:20.306 --> 00:32:23.474
Daddy? Why do you think
Mr. Duck is so mean?

346
00:32:23.475 --> 00:32:25.210
Uh…

347
00:32:25.211 --> 00:32:27.812
I think it's because he doesn't have
a family to spend Christmas with,

348
00:32:27.813 --> 00:32:36.554
like you and me.

349
00:32:36.555 --> 00:32:39.490
Look, that's the Christmas star.

350
00:32:39.491 --> 00:32:41.592
Make a wish
before you go to sleep.

351
00:32:41.593 --> 00:32:46.097
I wish for my Pretty Pudgy
Piggy doll, but even more,

352
00:32:46.098 --> 00:32:48.699
I wish my daddy didn't have to
go to work tomorrow

353
00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:53.671
so we could spend
Christmas Day together.

354
00:32:53.672 --> 00:33:06.451
Ditto.

355
00:33:10.989 --> 00:33:14.325
Why can't you just give the
sweet little thing her dolly?

356
00:33:14.326 --> 00:33:15.693
You don't need the money!

357
00:33:15.694 --> 00:33:18.096
You have a firm grasp
of guilt, Mr. Ghost,

358
00:33:18.097 --> 00:33:22.933
but you just don't understand
the first thing about greed.

359
00:33:22.934 --> 00:33:24.802
Why, you…

360
00:33:24.803 --> 00:33:28.239
How'd you like to ride back to
your office on the end of my foot?

361
00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:33.644
A lovely offer,
but I think I'll pass.

362
00:33:42.654 --> 00:33:45.523
<i>♪ O Christmas tree, ♪
♪ O Christmas tree ♪</i>

363
00:33:45.524 --> 00:33:50.161
<i>♪ Thy candles ♪
♪ shine out brightly! ♪</i>

364
00:33:55.667 --> 00:33:57.168
You look terrible.

365
00:33:57.169 --> 00:33:59.670
If I didn't know better, I'd think
you'd been beaten about the head

366
00:33:59.671 --> 00:34:01.839
with a candy cane,
dragged through the toilet,

367
00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:05.410
and kicked in the tail
feathers with a size 10 boot.

368
00:34:05.411 --> 00:34:07.212
That's not the half of it.

369
00:34:07.213 --> 00:34:08.979
I'm starting to crack, rabbit.

370
00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:11.982
Just a few minutes ago,
I was watching this little kid

371
00:34:11.983 --> 00:34:17.655
wishing on the Christmas star
and I almost felt… something.

372
00:34:17.656 --> 00:34:19.023
No. You?

373
00:34:19.024 --> 00:34:22.193
Does that mean you're willing
to mend your greedy ways?

374
00:34:22.194 --> 00:34:25.130
I said I felt something,
not insanity.

375
00:34:25.131 --> 00:34:29.934
Well, that's a shame, because I hear
the last ghost is a real doozy.

376
00:34:29.935 --> 00:34:32.036
Wait! There's another ghost?

377
00:34:39.178 --> 00:34:44.215
Well, that's my cue to leave.
Good luck in the afterworld.

378
00:34:44.216 --> 00:34:49.354
No! Please! Don't go! Hide me!
Please! Hide me!

379
00:34:49.355 --> 00:34:52.657
How can I possibly resist?

380
00:34:52.658 --> 00:34:55.560
Quick. In here.

381
00:34:56.695 --> 00:35:00.231
No, in here.

382
00:35:02.033 --> 00:35:03.701
Too obvious.

383
00:35:03.702 --> 00:35:05.403
In here.

384
00:35:11.009 --> 00:35:13.278
This is just too easy.

385
00:35:13.279 --> 00:35:17.782
I know. Over here.

386
00:35:27.859 --> 00:35:30.728
Duck!

387
00:35:30.729 --> 00:35:31.896
Mummy.

388
00:35:35.734 --> 00:35:39.670
Listen, Mr. Ghost, I'm not sure
exactly what you're after…

389
00:35:39.671 --> 00:35:41.572
You!

390
00:35:41.573 --> 00:35:44.141
I don't know what they're paying
you down at the ghost company,

391
00:35:44.142 --> 00:35:46.811
but whatever it is,
I'll triple it!

392
00:35:58.257 --> 00:36:00.891
Where are we?

393
00:36:00.892 --> 00:36:04.329
Christmas future.

394
00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:07.298
Try that again
and this time, enunciate.

395
00:36:09.201 --> 00:36:16.574
Christmas future!

396
00:36:16.575 --> 00:36:19.244
Well, I don't mean to tell you
your business, mumbles,

397
00:36:19.245 --> 00:36:21.446
but I think you've got
the wrong holiday.

398
00:36:21.447 --> 00:36:30.855
This place has a distinctly
Halloweeny vibe to it.

399
00:36:30.856 --> 00:36:39.730
Who's the stiff
taking a dirt nap?

400
00:36:39.731 --> 00:36:42.066
Mr. Daffy
Duck never had a family,

401
00:36:42.067 --> 00:36:43.868
or friends for that matter.

402
00:36:43.869 --> 00:36:46.937
But maybe now he'll finally
get what he always wanted.

403
00:36:46.938 --> 00:36:51.609
To be alone
with his money, forever.

404
00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:53.911
Surely I did
some good for others.

405
00:36:53.912 --> 00:36:57.615
I know, I provided them
with gainful employment.

406
00:36:57.616 --> 00:37:00.685
Daffy tried to leave his store
to himself in his will,

407
00:37:00.686 --> 00:37:02.387
which, of course, is illegal.

408
00:37:02.388 --> 00:37:08.593
As a result, Lucky Duck has been
closed and we're all out of jobs.

409
00:37:08.594 --> 00:37:10.495
But for the first time in years,

410
00:37:10.496 --> 00:37:15.933
we can all spend Christmas
with our families.

411
00:37:15.934 --> 00:37:17.302
Good-bye, Mr. Duck.

412
00:37:17.303 --> 00:37:28.846
Or as you liked
to say, bah, humduck.

413
00:37:28.847 --> 00:37:34.352
Please! Do something!

414
00:37:34.353 --> 00:37:38.222
I don't want to end up
lonely and alone.

415
00:37:40.759 --> 00:37:44.362
Now, that was just plain rude.

416
00:37:44.363 --> 00:37:48.333
Mr. Daffy? I know
everybody hated you.

417
00:37:48.334 --> 00:37:50.535
But I never hated you.

418
00:37:50.536 --> 00:37:54.171
Because I know as much
as anyone how sad and angry

419
00:37:54.172 --> 00:37:59.377
it can make a person to be
without family at the holidays.

420
00:37:59.378 --> 00:38:01.779
So, if you're up there watching,

421
00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:05.383
or down there, in your case,
I want you to know that

422
00:38:05.384 --> 00:38:07.852
you don't have to be
one anymore.

423
00:38:07.853 --> 00:38:11.756
'Cause from now on, every
Christmas, I'll come visit you.

424
00:38:11.757 --> 00:38:14.492
In case you don't know,
it's the one day of the year

425
00:38:14.493 --> 00:38:16.394
when everyone is family.

426
00:38:16.395 --> 00:38:19.330
I made you
some Christmas cookies.

427
00:38:19.331 --> 00:38:27.572
Merry Christmas, Mr. Duck.

428
00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:34.945
You know, mumbles,
I said I was sorry before.

429
00:38:34.946 --> 00:38:38.349
But now I really am.

430
00:38:40.619 --> 00:38:45.222
Can I please have second chance?

431
00:38:45.223 --> 00:38:58.969
Go!

432
00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:01.906
I'm alive! I'm okay!

433
00:39:01.907 --> 00:39:04.174
More importantly,
I'm a changed duck,

434
00:39:04.175 --> 00:39:06.777
filled with the spirit
of giving!

435
00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:15.520
Fudd, Fudd?
Thaw, Fudd! Thaw!

436
00:39:17.088 --> 00:39:19.223
What day is it?

437
00:39:19.224 --> 00:39:21.191
Christmas Day.

438
00:39:21.192 --> 00:39:23.027
Then I haven't missed it.

439
00:39:23.028 --> 00:39:27.331
I'm giving you a raise and a
month-long vacation in sunny Hawaii!

440
00:39:28.667 --> 00:39:32.169
But first, we've got
work to do. Come on!

441
00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:42.079
It's time to save Christmas!

442
00:39:51.389 --> 00:39:54.158
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!

443
00:39:54.159 --> 00:39:55.760
Marvin!

444
00:39:55.761 --> 00:39:58.663
I bought you a rocket so you
can fly home for the holidays!

445
00:39:58.664 --> 00:40:00.397
If you travel
at the speed of light,

446
00:40:00.398 --> 00:40:02.533
you should make it by yesterday!

447
00:40:02.534 --> 00:40:06.771
Oh! You make me
very happy!

448
00:40:06.772 --> 00:40:08.839
You'll never be
hungry again, Coyote.

449
00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:14.078
I'm hiring you
your own personal chef!

450
00:40:15.146 --> 00:40:19.216
Hey, Speedy!
Merry Christmas!

451
00:40:19.217 --> 00:40:23.554
Or as they say in your
country, fleas and eggnog!

452
00:40:23.555 --> 00:40:25.055
Eh, it's close enough.

453
00:40:25.056 --> 00:40:29.026
A Pretty Pudgy Piggy doll
for the pretty, pretty piggy.

454
00:40:30.462 --> 00:40:33.564
And Pretty Pudgy
Piggy doll accessories,

455
00:40:33.565 --> 00:40:35.733
complete with Pretty Pudgy
Piggy doll pony

456
00:40:35.734 --> 00:40:38.302
and Pretty Pudgy Piggy doll
dream house.

457
00:40:38.303 --> 00:40:39.637
And that's not all!

458
00:40:39.638 --> 00:40:42.840
I'm giving your dad,
I mean my new store manager,

459
00:40:42.841 --> 00:40:47.978
and all my other loyal employees
a raise and a paid vacation!

460
00:40:47.979 --> 00:40:50.214
Are you okay, sir?

461
00:40:50.215 --> 00:40:52.082
I'm better than okay.

462
00:40:52.083 --> 00:40:55.486
After all these years
of greed and selfishness,

463
00:40:55.487 --> 00:40:57.955
I finally feel like…

464
00:40:57.956 --> 00:40:59.423
A lucky duck!

465
00:40:59.424 --> 00:41:01.291
It's a miracle, Daddy.

466
00:41:01.292 --> 00:41:06.296
Yes, dear, a miracle.

467
00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:28.886
Sir, I know you don't have
a regular family,

468
00:41:28.887 --> 00:41:32.690
but today, we'd like you
to be a part of ours.

469
00:41:32.691 --> 00:41:34.124
In case you don't know,

470
00:41:34.125 --> 00:41:36.694
that's what Christmas
is all about, Mr. Duck.

471
00:41:38.864 --> 00:41:40.464
Aw.

472
00:41:40.465 --> 00:41:46.537
I say… I say, son…

473
00:41:46.538 --> 00:41:50.507
Huh?

474
00:42:02.187 --> 00:42:06.156
Presents, cash bonuses,
improved health coverage.

475
00:42:06.157 --> 00:42:08.859
I'm gonna go broke!

476
00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:12.229
I gotta think of a strategy
to reverse the situation.

477
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:14.732
Should I steal back
all the presents?

478
00:42:14.733 --> 00:42:16.601
Should I cut
everyone's salaries?

479
00:42:16.602 --> 00:42:19.136
I gotta concentrate.

480
00:42:19.137 --> 00:42:27.645
Excuse me, sir.
Would you like a cookie?

481
00:42:28.947 --> 00:42:31.582
Merry Christmas, Uncle Daffy.

482
00:42:31.583 --> 00:42:36.153
Uncle? Well, that may be
pushing it a little…

483
00:42:36.154 --> 00:42:43.027
Okay. Uncle Daffy it is.

484
00:42:43.028 --> 00:42:46.864
The varmint did it.
He plum turned hisself around.

485
00:42:46.865 --> 00:42:51.568
Ghost of Christmas
Yet to Come happy.

486
00:42:54.572 --> 00:42:56.641
Everyone, can I have
your attention?

487
00:42:56.642 --> 00:43:01.511
I want to propose
a toast to Mr. Daffy, the…

488
00:43:01.512 --> 00:43:03.714
The greatest boss ever.

489
00:43:03.715 --> 00:43:11.722
Merry Christmas!

490
00:43:11.723 --> 00:43:22.399
Don't you just love
the holidays?

491
00:43:24.602 --> 00:43:28.438
That's all, folks!
