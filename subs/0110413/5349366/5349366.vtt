WEBVTT

1
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.996
OK, OK.

2
00:02:11.122 --> 00:02:13.666
Let's talk business.

3
00:02:13.792 --> 00:02:17.419
This fat bastard is trying to move in
on Maurizio's business.

4
00:02:17.546 --> 00:02:20.255
Now you know Maurizio
is a reasonable guy.

5
00:02:20.381 --> 00:02:23.843
He just wants. . .a little conversation.

6
00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:28.639
But this guy, he don't wanna hear
about it. Maybe he'll listen to you.

7
00:02:28.765 --> 00:02:32.059
He comes to town every Tuesday.
Are you free Tuesday?

8
00:02:34.855 --> 00:02:36.772
Yeah, I'm free Tuesday.

9
00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:55.833
Nice to see you again, Mr Jones.

10
00:03:09.848 --> 00:03:13.350
Remember, neatness counts.
You got one half hour.

11
00:03:21.985 --> 00:03:23.402
One hour.

12
00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:38.792
- Yeah, what?
- This is Tonto downstairs.

13
00:03:40.211 --> 00:03:45.132
- There's a guy who wants to talk to you.
- What's he look like?

14
00:03:48.053 --> 00:03:49.636
Serious.

15
00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:52.889
- Tell him I'm coming up.
- He's coming up.

16
00:03:55.893 --> 00:03:59.063
Somebody's coming up.
Somebody serious.

17
00:04:03.943 --> 00:04:06.778
Mickey, open your eyes,
we got company.

18
00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.283
We got company.

19
00:04:23.754 --> 00:04:25.172
Come on.

20
00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.640
Stop! Stop, men!

21
00:04:42.106 --> 00:04:43.440
Tonto.

22
00:04:45.985 --> 00:04:49.446
Tell the driver to wait for us
out back and hurry up!

23
00:05:35.743 --> 00:05:37.619
Hey, sweetie, what's going on?

24
00:05:37.745 --> 00:05:41.080
Don't worry, baby. It's cool. Take a nap.

25
00:05:59.516 --> 00:06:01.017
Oh, my God!

26
00:06:01.852 --> 00:06:03.978
Those fuckers blocked both the exits.

27
00:06:09.151 --> 00:06:11.069
Check the terrace!

28
00:07:23.183 --> 00:07:24.600
911 emergency.

29
00:07:24.726 --> 00:07:27.061
I need help!
Somebody's trying to kill me!

30
00:07:27.187 --> 00:07:31.023
All right, just stay on the line.
I'll just be off for a moment.

31
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.317
Sir, I'm gonna connect you
with an officer.

32
00:07:33.443 --> 00:07:34.860
OK.

33
00:07:52.086 --> 00:07:55.005
Detective Jefferson, may I help you?

34
00:07:55.131 --> 00:07:57.090
I'll call you back.

35
00:08:00.762 --> 00:08:05.349
Hey, relax, man. I got half of Bolivia
sitting in those suitcases over there.

36
00:08:05.475 --> 00:08:08.894
Ain't even been cut yet.
Go ahead, take it, it's yours.

37
00:08:13.775 --> 00:08:15.651
Dial this number.

38
00:08:29.248 --> 00:08:31.875
I'll talk to you later, sweetie, OK?

39
00:08:33.002 --> 00:08:34.420
Bye.

40
00:08:38.675 --> 00:08:41.760
- Hello?
- It's Maurizio. Remember me?

41
00:08:41.886 --> 00:08:44.513
- I see you're back in town.
- Yeah. . .

42
00:08:44.639 --> 00:08:47.600
No. I mean, no! Just for today.

43
00:08:48.518 --> 00:08:51.353
So it's safe to say
today's your last day in town

44
00:08:51.479 --> 00:08:54.022
and we'll never see
your fat fucking face again?

45
00:08:54.148 --> 00:08:56.734
Yeah. . .right.

46
00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.402
Let me speak to our mutual friend.

47
00:09:01.405 --> 00:09:03.574
He wants to talk to you.

48
00:09:08.412 --> 00:09:11.123
- Yes.
- Make sure he understands.

49
00:09:11.249 --> 00:09:13.083
Then let him go.

50
00:09:21.634 --> 00:09:23.510
Do you understand?

51
00:09:25.596 --> 00:09:27.973
- So say it.
- I understand.

52
00:09:30.226 --> 00:09:31.643
Good.

53
00:09:57.711 --> 00:09:59.129
Jesus.

54
00:10:09.598 --> 00:10:11.641
Two milks as usual?

55
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.458
Hi.

56
00:11:22.212 --> 00:11:24.881
Why did you hide the cigarette?

57
00:11:25.007 --> 00:11:29.511
This building's full of rats.
I don't want my old man to find out.

58
00:11:29.637 --> 00:11:31.554
Got enough problems.

59
00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.608
What happened?

60
00:11:43.734 --> 00:11:45.610
I fell off my bike.

61
00:11:56.163 --> 00:11:57.413
Hey.

62
00:11:58.999 --> 00:12:01.918
Don't tell my dad
about the cigarette, OK?

63
00:12:22.981 --> 00:12:24.899
What's my job? I'm just a holder.

64
00:12:25.025 --> 00:12:27.777
I hold the stuff just like you give it to me.
I don't look at it. I don't touch it.

65
00:12:27.903 --> 00:12:30.196
- I don't even know how to cut it.
- Try and follow me, all right?

66
00:12:30.322 --> 00:12:32.699
In June when we gave you the dope,
it tests 100%  pure.

67
00:12:32.825 --> 00:12:36.368
Now it's July. We pick up the dope
and it tests 90%  pure.

68
00:12:36.494 --> 00:12:39.914
Now somewhere between June
and July 10%  turned to cut.

69
00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.540
That's none of my business,
I'm just a holder.

70
00:12:41.667 --> 00:12:44.210
You give me the stuff,
I hold the stuff, that's all I know!

71
00:12:44.336 --> 00:12:47.004
Hey look, you know,
I'm trying to help you out here.

72
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:52.093
But, you know, if you're gonna be
a hard ass about it, I gotta disturb him.

73
00:12:52.219 --> 00:12:57.014
Now let me tell you, when he's into
his music, he hates being disturbed.

74
00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.725
I'm telling you the truth!

75
00:12:59.852 --> 00:13:04.105
I hope so. Because he's got a talent
for sniffing out a lie.

76
00:13:04.231 --> 00:13:08.150
It's scary,
it's almost like a sixth sense.

77
00:13:09.194 --> 00:13:13.697
Now, are you gonna change your tune
or do I gotta bust into his?

78
00:13:15.742 --> 00:13:17.952
I'm telling you the truth.

79
00:13:25.293 --> 00:13:26.710
All right.

80
00:13:28.713 --> 00:13:30.714
Stan. Stan.

81
00:13:34.511 --> 00:13:38.305
I'm sorry, you see,
he said he didn't cut the dope.

82
00:13:40.517 --> 00:13:41.725
Oh.

83
00:14:19.514 --> 00:14:21.515
Of course, he didn't.

84
00:14:30.983 --> 00:14:35.362
Just do me a favor.
Find out who did. For tomorrow.

85
00:14:36.281 --> 00:14:37.698
Noon.

86
00:14:49.085 --> 00:14:51.462
Malky, hey, wait!

87
00:14:51.588 --> 00:14:55.757
Hey, I didn't cut your shit!
Find out yourself!

88
00:15:00.763 --> 00:15:03.432
What the hell are you doing out here?
Get inside and do your homework.

89
00:15:03.558 --> 00:15:05.183
- I did it already.
- Oh, yeah?

90
00:15:05.309 --> 00:15:07.769
Get inside and help your sister
clean up the goddamn house!

91
00:15:07.895 --> 00:15:09.980
And stop smoking cigarettes!

92
00:17:08.765 --> 00:17:10.683
Time's up, my turn now.

93
00:17:10.809 --> 00:17:13.478
Change the channel
and I'll smash your face!

94
00:17:27.033 --> 00:17:28.909
Sorry, sweetheart.

95
00:17:32.289 --> 00:17:33.956
Good morning, sleepy.

96
00:17:35.209 --> 00:17:37.377
Hi, honey. Hey, you two.

97
00:17:38.044 --> 00:17:41.589
Sweetheart, turn that down,
mum has got a headache.

98
00:17:41.715 --> 00:17:43.007
She took my turn!

99
00:17:43.133 --> 00:17:45.343
She just wants to watch
goddamn cartoons!

100
00:17:45.469 --> 00:17:48.971
- It wouldn't hurt to move her ass.
- I'm not the one with the fat ass!

101
00:17:51.517 --> 00:17:54.018
Can someone who's doing nothing
all day but watching cartoons

102
00:17:54.144 --> 00:17:56.896
move her little ass
and go get some food?

103
00:17:59.441 --> 00:18:01.066
I dare you to say that again.

104
00:18:05.822 --> 00:18:09.617
- Margie, I think I screwed up.
- It wouldn't be the first time.

105
00:18:09.743 --> 00:18:11.577
You always come up
with something, right?

106
00:18:11.703 --> 00:18:15.205
Yeah, but I think I went
a little too far this time.

107
00:18:15.331 --> 00:18:18.793
You're going a little too far right now.
I'm gonna be late for work.

108
00:18:18.919 --> 00:18:21.421
How about working at home today?

109
00:18:30.972 --> 00:18:34.141
She's gonna hit me! Daddy. . .

110
00:18:34.267 --> 00:18:37.436
Shit, shut the goddamn door!

111
00:18:41.191 --> 00:18:42.942
Fucking bitch!

112
00:18:52.786 --> 00:18:55.746
- Can somebody answer the phone?
- I'm busy!

113
00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:05.005
- Hello?
- This is Margaret McAllister.

114
00:19:05.131 --> 00:19:08.175
Headmistress at the Spencer School
in Wildwood, New Jersey.

115
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:11.929
Is Mr or Mrs Lando home?

116
00:19:15.183 --> 00:19:17.101
Yes, this is she.

117
00:19:17.227 --> 00:19:20.687
Mrs Lando, when your husband
enrolled Mathilda at Spencer,

118
00:19:20.814 --> 00:19:22.982
he told us she had problems.

119
00:19:23.108 --> 00:19:25.735
As you know, we pride ourselves
in turning troubled girls

120
00:19:25.861 --> 00:19:27.778
into healthy, productive young women.

121
00:19:27.904 --> 00:19:30.865
But if they are not here,
there is very little we can do.

122
00:19:30.991 --> 00:19:34.076
Now, Mathilda left school without
permission nearly two weeks ago.

123
00:19:34.202 --> 00:19:37.204
I know your husband paid tuition
in advance for a year.

124
00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:41.333
But if you refer to page 20 in the rules
and regulations manual we sent you,

125
00:19:41.459 --> 00:19:45.379
you will see that unless there is
a valid excuse for prolonged absence,

126
00:19:45.505 --> 00:19:47.797
your tuition will be forfeit.

127
00:19:48.591 --> 00:19:50.217
She's dead.

128
00:21:26.564 --> 00:21:30.484
Is life always this hard,
or is it just when you're a kid?

129
00:21:34.447 --> 00:21:35.864
Always like this.

130
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:44.247
Keep it.

131
00:21:51.338 --> 00:21:55.925
Hey, I'm going grocery shopping.
You want some milk?

132
00:21:56.051 --> 00:21:58.970
One quart or two? It's two, right?

133
00:23:42.366 --> 00:23:45.618
I like these calm little moments
before the storm.

134
00:23:47.954 --> 00:23:50.038
It reminds me of Beethoven.

135
00:23:56.087 --> 00:23:57.880
Can you hear it?

136
00:23:58.965 --> 00:24:03.093
It's like, when you put
your head to the grass.

137
00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:06.972
You can hear it growing.
You can hear the insects. . .

138
00:24:14.022 --> 00:24:16.440
- Do you like Beethoven?
- Couldn't really say.

139
00:24:16.566 --> 00:24:18.359
I'm gonna play you some.

140
00:24:23.365 --> 00:24:25.283
Daddy!

141
00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.336
Benny, stay here!

142
00:24:44.177 --> 00:24:46.512
Daddy! Daddy!

143
00:25:00.151 --> 00:25:01.694
Jesus! Fuck!

144
00:25:19.045 --> 00:25:20.879
We said noon!

145
00:25:24.634 --> 00:25:26.343
I've got one minute past.

146
00:25:30.473 --> 00:25:32.641
You don't like Beethoven.

147
00:25:34.018 --> 00:25:36.019
You don't know what you're missing.

148
00:25:36.145 --> 00:25:40.357
Overtures like that
get my juices flowing.

149
00:25:40.483 --> 00:25:42.317
So powerful!

150
00:25:43.486 --> 00:25:46.238
But after his openings,
to be honest,

151
00:25:47.448 --> 00:25:50.492
he does tend to get
a little fucking boring.

152
00:25:53.997 --> 00:25:55.998
That's why I stopped!

153
00:26:00.253 --> 00:26:02.170
Toss the apartment.

154
00:26:23.317 --> 00:26:26.904
You're a Mozart fan. I love him, too.

155
00:26:28.072 --> 00:26:29.948
I love Mozart!

156
00:26:35.163 --> 00:26:37.164
He was Austrian, you know.

157
00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:41.584
But for this kind of work. . .
he's a little bit light.

158
00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:44.504
So I tend to go for the heavier guys.

159
00:26:45.214 --> 00:26:48.133
- Cool.
- What the fuck are you doing?

160
00:26:48.259 --> 00:26:50.968
Man, keep your bombaclot mouth shut.

161
00:26:51.929 --> 00:26:54.056
Check out Brahms, he's good, too.

162
00:26:55.016 --> 00:26:56.641
What the fuck do you know
about music?

163
00:26:56.767 --> 00:26:58.601
Knock it off!

164
00:27:12.616 --> 00:27:15.243
- Checked the mattress?
- Nope.

165
00:28:20.768 --> 00:28:23.019
- Fuck!
- Stan!

166
00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:28.650
- Look what you did.
- Stan, you all right?

167
00:28:28.776 --> 00:28:30.527
Look what you did!

168
00:28:49.171 --> 00:28:53.507
Hey, Stan. Stan! What are you doing?
What are you doing? He's dead!

169
00:28:53.634 --> 00:28:55.677
But he ruined my suit.

170
00:28:55.803 --> 00:28:58.680
I know. I know, but he's dead.

171
00:28:58.806 --> 00:29:02.349
He's a piece of meat, forget about it.
Calm down.

172
00:29:02.475 --> 00:29:04.060
I'm calm.

173
00:29:04.853 --> 00:29:06.353
Stay there, OK?

174
00:29:09.691 --> 00:29:13.820
Benny!

175
00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:17.031
Jesus fucking Christ, Benny!

176
00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:19.992
It's Malky and Stan!

177
00:29:21.536 --> 00:29:25.539
Take it easy, all right?
Come on, come on.

178
00:29:25.665 --> 00:29:27.249
Benny!

179
00:29:29.336 --> 00:29:31.295
Come on.
Let's get a cigarette, all right?

180
00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.965
Benny, we're coming out!

181
00:29:34.757 --> 00:29:36.717
Benny, don't fire!

182
00:29:36.844 --> 00:29:38.552
Get in!

183
00:29:39.721 --> 00:29:42.014
Jesus fucking Christ, Benny!

184
00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:43.640
You wear something new. . .

185
00:29:46.269 --> 00:29:47.811
Take it easy!

186
00:29:49.272 --> 00:29:51.023
What's happening out there?

187
00:29:51.149 --> 00:29:53.484
It's all right, ma'am, go in.
DEA. Police.

188
00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:56.195
Why don't you leave
that poor family alone?

189
00:29:56.321 --> 00:29:57.738
Everything's all right.
Just calm down.

190
00:29:57.864 --> 00:30:00.074
I am calm. I'm calm.

191
00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.201
Why don't you leave them alone?

192
00:30:03.661 --> 00:30:06.705
He said go back inside!

193
00:30:11.628 --> 00:30:14.255
Stan, I think it's better
if we go inside, all right?

194
00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.901
Benny, turn that kitchen
upside down, find that shit!

195
00:30:36.819 --> 00:30:39.321
Willy Blood, look what you did!

196
00:30:39.447 --> 00:30:42.991
You killed a four-year-old kid!
Did you really have to do that?

197
00:30:58.966 --> 00:31:01.009
Please, open the door.

198
00:31:07.058 --> 00:31:16.817
Please.

199
00:31:57.775 --> 00:32:02.738
Benny, there's three kids here.
I think Stan killed this girl.

200
00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:06.241
And Willy, that asshole,
shot the little boy.

201
00:32:06.367 --> 00:32:08.952
The third one's missing. Find her.

202
00:32:18.004 --> 00:32:20.672
Oh, shit.
Hey, we missed the little girl, man.

203
00:32:20.798 --> 00:32:25.635
I'm gonna try and find the fucking
super of this goddamn building.

204
00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.763
Yo, I found it!

205
00:33:10.889 --> 00:33:12.140
Bingo!

206
00:33:12.266 --> 00:33:13.808
Stan, we found it.

207
00:33:13.934 --> 00:33:15.310
I know.

208
00:33:15.436 --> 00:33:17.103
Here it is.

209
00:33:18.564 --> 00:33:20.356
There's cops outside, we better go.

210
00:33:20.482 --> 00:33:23.734
It's the cops outside.
We better go. You stay here.

211
00:33:26.613 --> 00:33:29.282
What do you want me to tell them?

212
00:33:39.835 --> 00:33:41.336
Tell them. . .

213
00:33:41.462 --> 00:33:45.548
we were doing. . .our job.

214
00:33:55.392 --> 00:33:57.227
What's your name?

215
00:33:57.353 --> 00:33:59.229
Mathilda.

216
00:34:04.943 --> 00:34:06.361
Sorry about your father.

217
00:34:06.487 --> 00:34:10.490
If somebody didn't do it,
I would've probably done it myself.

218
00:34:12.618 --> 00:34:14.910
- Your mother, she. . .
- She's not my mother.

219
00:34:16.162 --> 00:34:19.790
And my sister, she wanted
to lose some weight anyway.

220
00:34:19.916 --> 00:34:23.711
But she never looked better.
Not even my real sister.

221
00:34:23.837 --> 00:34:27.006
Just a half-sister,
and not a good half at that.

222
00:34:37.225 --> 00:34:39.018
If you couldn't stand them,
why are you crying?

223
00:34:39.144 --> 00:34:40.936
Because they killed my brother.

224
00:34:42.439 --> 00:34:46.484
What the hell did he do?
He was four years old.

225
00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:51.321
He never used to cry.
Just used to sit next to me and cuddle.

226
00:34:53.867 --> 00:34:57.787
I was more of a mother to him
than that goddamn pig ever was!

227
00:34:57.913 --> 00:35:01.999
Hey, don't talk like that about pigs.
They're usually much nicer than people.

228
00:35:02.125 --> 00:35:04.293
But they smell like shit.

229
00:35:06.421 --> 00:35:07.838
Not true!

230
00:35:07.964 --> 00:35:11.425
As a matter of fact,
right now I have one in my kitchen

231
00:35:12.844 --> 00:35:16.764
that's very clean and smells very nice.

232
00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:19.600
You don't have a pig in your kitchen.

233
00:35:20.769 --> 00:35:22.019
Yes, I do.

234
00:35:22.145 --> 00:35:25.230
I was just in there
and I didn't see any goddamn pig.

235
00:35:26.232 --> 00:35:28.150
Don't move, I'll get him.

236
00:35:31.154 --> 00:35:34.156
Piggy? Piggy? Where are you?

237
00:35:34.282 --> 00:35:36.575
Ah, there you are!

238
00:35:43.374 --> 00:35:45.459
Hi, Mathilda.

239
00:35:46.753 --> 00:35:48.253
Hi, Piggy.

240
00:35:57.722 --> 00:35:59.681
How are you today?

241
00:36:00.266 --> 00:36:02.351
I've seen better days.

242
00:36:09.943 --> 00:36:12.736
What's your name?

243
00:36:12.863 --> 00:36:14.404
Leon.

244
00:36:17.658 --> 00:36:19.576
Cute name.

245
00:36:25.333 --> 00:36:28.961
You have anyone to go to?
Any family, any place else?

246
00:36:41.349 --> 00:36:43.683
I'm gonna get some more milk.

247
00:37:02.077 --> 00:37:03.495
Holy shit!

248
00:37:09.919 --> 00:37:12.462
Don't touch that, please.

249
00:37:12.588 --> 00:37:15.924
Leon, what exactly
do you do for a living?

250
00:37:17.009 --> 00:37:18.635
Cleaner.

251
00:37:20.137 --> 00:37:22.639
You mean you're a hitman?

252
00:37:22.765 --> 00:37:24.391
Yeah.

253
00:37:25.643 --> 00:37:26.935
Cool.

254
00:37:39.574 --> 00:37:41.157
Do you clean anyone?

255
00:37:41.283 --> 00:37:44.035
No women, no kids, that's the rules.

256
00:37:44.161 --> 00:37:47.163
How much would it cost to hire
someone to get those dirtbags

257
00:37:47.289 --> 00:37:48.957
who killed my brother?

258
00:37:50.334 --> 00:37:52.877
- Five grand a head.
- Wow. . .

259
00:37:54.589 --> 00:37:56.715
How about this?

260
00:37:56.841 --> 00:38:01.553
I work for you, and in exchange
you teach me how to clean.

261
00:38:03.556 --> 00:38:06.975
What do you think? I'll clean
your place, I'll do the shopping.

262
00:38:07.101 --> 00:38:09.143
I'll even wash your clothes.

263
00:38:10.605 --> 00:38:12.313
Is it a deal?

264
00:38:13.398 --> 00:38:16.150
No. It's not a deal.

265
00:38:22.533 --> 00:38:27.078
What do you want me to do?
I've got no place to go.

266
00:38:28.413 --> 00:38:30.707
You've had a rough day today.

267
00:38:34.253 --> 00:38:36.462
Go to sleep
and we'll see tomorrow, OK?

268
00:38:51.603 --> 00:38:54.022
You've been really great with me,
Leon.

269
00:38:54.148 --> 00:38:57.316
And it's not always like that,

270
00:38:57.442 --> 00:38:59.068
you know?

271
00:39:07.369 --> 00:39:09.412
Good night.

272
00:40:26.156 --> 00:40:28.115
Sleep well?

273
00:40:28.242 --> 00:40:30.784
Good, because after breakfast
you gotta take off.

274
00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:33.787
- Where to?
- Not my problem.

275
00:40:49.638 --> 00:40:51.847
Read it.

276
00:40:57.562 --> 00:40:59.271
You don't know how to read.

277
00:40:59.398 --> 00:41:03.150
I'm learning,
but I had a lot of work lately, so. . .

278
00:41:04.486 --> 00:41:07.195
I'm a little behind.
What's it say?

279
00:41:07.321 --> 00:41:11.158
"I've decided what to do with my life.
I wanna be a cleaner."

280
00:41:12.035 --> 00:41:16.872
You wanna be a cleaner?
Here. Take it.

281
00:41:16.998 --> 00:41:19.708
It's a goodbye gift. Go clean.

282
00:41:19.834 --> 00:41:22.628
But not with me.
I work alone. Understand. Alone?

283
00:41:22.754 --> 00:41:26.048
Bonnie and Clyde didn't work alone.
Thelma and Louise didn't work alone.

284
00:41:26.174 --> 00:41:28.509
And they were the best.

285
00:41:29.511 --> 00:41:33.597
Mathilda,
why are you doing this to me?

286
00:41:33.723 --> 00:41:35.683
I've been nothing but nice to you.

287
00:41:35.809 --> 00:41:39.311
I even saved your life yesterday,
right outside the door.

288
00:41:39.437 --> 00:41:42.606
Right, so now you're responsible for it.

289
00:41:42.732 --> 00:41:46.068
If you saved my life, you must have
saved it for a good reason.

290
00:41:46.194 --> 00:41:48.904
If you throw me out now,
it's like you never opened your door.

291
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:51.782
Like you let me die right there
in front of it.

292
00:41:51.908 --> 00:41:56.036
But you did open it, so. . .

293
00:41:58.665 --> 00:42:00.457
Mathilda. . .

294
00:42:00.583 --> 00:42:04.795
If you don't help me,
I'll die tonight. I can feel it.

295
00:42:04.921 --> 00:42:07.589
But I don't want to die tonight.

296
00:42:08.717 --> 00:42:11.426
Mathilda, you're just a little girl,

297
00:42:11.552 --> 00:42:15.347
so don't take it badly,
but I don't think you could do it.

298
00:42:15.473 --> 00:42:17.015
I'm sorry.

299
00:42:35.827 --> 00:42:37.410
How's that?

300
00:43:08.442 --> 00:43:09.901
Mathilda,

301
00:43:11.445 --> 00:43:14.572
don't you ever do that again
or I'll break your head.

302
00:43:14.698 --> 00:43:17.159
- You got that?
- OK.

303
00:43:17.285 --> 00:43:21.579
I don't work like that.
It's not professional. There is rules.

304
00:43:22.873 --> 00:43:26.584
- OK.
- And stop saying "OK" all the time! OK?

305
00:43:27.753 --> 00:43:29.421
OK.

306
00:43:29.547 --> 00:43:30.963
Good.

307
00:43:43.977 --> 00:43:45.395
Hi!

308
00:43:46.897 --> 00:43:50.483
You expect to use that
in this hotel?

309
00:43:50.609 --> 00:43:53.778
Mister, I have to use it,

310
00:43:53.904 --> 00:44:00.159
because I have an audition at Juilliard
next month and I have to practice.

311
00:44:00.953 --> 00:44:04.080
OK, but not after 10:00.

312
00:44:04.206 --> 00:44:06.248
OK, I promise.

313
00:44:08.752 --> 00:44:14.048
I'll put you at the end of the hall
so that you don't disturb anyone.

314
00:44:16.009 --> 00:44:18.553
Could you fill those out please?

315
00:44:21.223 --> 00:44:24.308
Daddy, can I please fill them out?

316
00:44:24.435 --> 00:44:27.228
You know how I like
to check in to hotels.

317
00:44:29.982 --> 00:44:32.734
Thanks, pop.
I'll bring these back in a minute.

318
00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:34.193
Fourth floor.

319
00:44:34.319 --> 00:44:35.862
Thanks, mister!

320
00:44:35.988 --> 00:44:39.991
You're lucky to have a little girl
that's interested in things.

321
00:44:41.577 --> 00:44:44.871
I have a kid, seventeen,
does nothing all day long.

322
00:44:50.711 --> 00:44:53.546
Can I leave my plant here
while I take my stuff upstairs?

323
00:44:54.297 --> 00:44:55.422
Of course.

324
00:45:16.403 --> 00:45:19.613
I'm putting the name of a girl
in my class who makes me sick.

325
00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:25.703
When things get hot,
she'll take the heat.

326
00:45:43.596 --> 00:45:45.389
There, finished.

327
00:45:45.515 --> 00:45:48.935
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

328
00:45:49.686 --> 00:45:51.270
Eighteen?

329
00:45:51.396 --> 00:45:53.564
Wanna see my license?

330
00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:57.944
No. You just look a little. . .younger.

331
00:45:58.862 --> 00:46:00.279
Thanks.

332
00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:11.165
Leon, I want you to teach me
how to be like you.

333
00:46:11.291 --> 00:46:14.085
I wanna be strong like you,
smart like you.

334
00:46:14.211 --> 00:46:16.837
- Mathilda. . .
- I know I'm not strong enough yet.

335
00:46:18.215 --> 00:46:22.259
But I could learn the basics, the theory.

336
00:46:22.385 --> 00:46:25.554
What do you think?
Just the theory.

337
00:46:27.099 --> 00:46:32.644
I need this, Leon. I need time
to get my head together.

338
00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:34.938
Yeah. And I need. . .

339
00:46:41.404 --> 00:46:42.738
. . .a drink.

340
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:45.824
Don't move. I'll go get one.

341
00:46:53.082 --> 00:46:54.416
Salute.

342
00:47:10.933 --> 00:47:14.395
You know, when you told me
to get this baby out for you,

343
00:47:14.521 --> 00:47:16.730
I thought my hearing's going.

344
00:47:16.856 --> 00:47:21.652
I says to myself, "Leon's a pro.
Nobody uses that, except beginners."

345
00:47:21.778 --> 00:47:23.487
I like to stay in shape.

346
00:47:23.613 --> 00:47:25.155
Sure.

347
00:47:26.198 --> 00:47:28.241
Always stay on top.

348
00:47:28.368 --> 00:47:31.244
It's like me. I gotta know
where everything is all the time.

349
00:47:31.371 --> 00:47:34.456
That's why I never leave this place
except to go from here to there.

350
00:47:37.877 --> 00:47:40.712
Change ain't good, Leon. You know?

351
00:47:44.801 --> 00:47:46.217
Yeah.

352
00:47:51.808 --> 00:47:53.308
Check it.

353
00:47:55.061 --> 00:47:57.437
- Make sure it's the right thing.
- I trust you.

354
00:47:57.564 --> 00:47:59.773
One thing's got nothing
to do with the other.

355
00:47:59.899 --> 00:48:02.067
Remember that, Leon.

356
00:48:02.193 --> 00:48:03.610
I will.

357
00:48:19.001 --> 00:48:22.170
The rifle is the first weapon
you learn how to use,

358
00:48:22.296 --> 00:48:25.966
because it lets you keep
your distance from the client.

359
00:48:26.092 --> 00:48:30.053
The closer you get to being a pro,
the closer you can get to the client.

360
00:48:31.555 --> 00:48:35.016
The knife, for example,
is the last thing you learn.

361
00:48:36.393 --> 00:48:39.020
- OK?
- OK.

362
00:48:40.857 --> 00:48:42.107
Position.

363
00:49:03.921 --> 00:49:05.338
No.

364
00:49:06.298 --> 00:49:10.135
Never take it off until the last minute,
it reflects light.

365
00:49:10.261 --> 00:49:13.179
They can see you coming
from a mile away.

366
00:49:13.305 --> 00:49:19.519
And always dress down,
never brighter than the floor. OK?

367
00:49:20.479 --> 00:49:21.897
OK.

368
00:49:23.482 --> 00:49:26.609
Let's practice now.
It's the best way to learn.

369
00:49:27.611 --> 00:49:29.737
Who should I hit?

370
00:49:29.863 --> 00:49:31.531
Whoever.

371
00:49:38.414 --> 00:49:40.623
I'll be with you in a second,
give me a few minutes.

372
00:49:40.749 --> 00:49:44.794
You guys in the suits get lost.
I don't want to see you, all right?

373
00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:46.879
It has to look natural.

374
00:49:56.473 --> 00:49:58.349
No women, no kids, right?

375
00:49:58.475 --> 00:49:59.934
Right.

376
00:50:07.193 --> 00:50:09.527
The jogger in the yellow and orange?

377
00:50:09.653 --> 00:50:11.070
OK.

378
00:50:14.241 --> 00:50:15.741
Keep calm.

379
00:50:19.996 --> 00:50:22.290
Don't take your eyes off him.

380
00:50:23.625 --> 00:50:25.335
Breathe easy.

381
00:50:27.045 --> 00:50:28.588
Watch his movement.

382
00:50:31.174 --> 00:50:33.426
Pretend you're running with him.

383
00:50:37.431 --> 00:50:39.849
Try to feel his next movement.

384
00:50:41.477 --> 00:50:44.061
Take a deep breath, hold it.

385
00:50:53.489 --> 00:50:54.655
Now.

386
00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:59.952
- I'm all right. I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Get down!

387
00:51:00.704 --> 00:51:02.788
One shot. Not bad, huh?

388
00:51:07.461 --> 00:51:10.045
Can we try with real bullets now?

389
00:51:10.547 --> 00:51:12.465
Not today. Let's pack up.

390
00:51:21.474 --> 00:51:23.392
Continue like that.

391
00:51:23.977 --> 00:51:25.978
Here, after. . .

392
00:52:06.436 --> 00:52:07.728
No thanks.

393
00:52:07.854 --> 00:52:09.563
No discussion.

394
00:52:50.771 --> 00:52:52.564
"It seemed. . .

395
00:52:53.816 --> 00:52:55.942
". . .to Socrates. . ."

396
00:52:58.654 --> 00:53:01.656
To So-cra-tes. . .

397
00:53:03.784 --> 00:53:05.410
I'll do it.

398
00:53:19.592 --> 00:53:21.760
Leon, all we do is work.

399
00:53:22.303 --> 00:53:25.472
We need a break. Let's play a game.

400
00:53:25.598 --> 00:53:27.141
What kind of game?

401
00:53:27.267 --> 00:53:29.100
I have this great game.

402
00:53:29.227 --> 00:53:31.311
It makes you think
and it helps your memory.

403
00:53:31.437 --> 00:53:33.104
It's exactly what you need.

404
00:53:35.941 --> 00:53:37.442
OK.

405
00:53:58.130 --> 00:54:00.799
- OK. Who is it?
- I don't know.

406
00:54:21.236 --> 00:54:22.862
I don't know.

407
00:54:32.414 --> 00:54:34.248
Moustache. . .

408
00:54:37.002 --> 00:54:38.169
No.

409
00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:48.722
Gene Kelly?

410
00:54:48.848 --> 00:54:50.139
Good.

411
00:54:50.683 --> 00:54:52.475
Your turn now.

412
00:54:58.691 --> 00:55:00.316
OK, pilgrim.

413
00:55:04.113 --> 00:55:06.405
Clint Eastwood?

414
00:55:12.287 --> 00:55:13.830
I don't know, I give up.

415
00:55:15.415 --> 00:55:16.958
John Wayne.

416
00:55:17.793 --> 00:55:20.419
I was just about to say that, I swear.

417
00:55:20.545 --> 00:55:23.672
It's amazing, Leon, really, brilliant.

418
00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:27.718
Amazing.

419
00:55:42.985 --> 00:55:45.819
- You love your plant, don't you?
- It's my best friend.

420
00:55:47.489 --> 00:55:50.074
Always happy. No questions.

421
00:55:52.619 --> 00:55:54.620
And it's like me, you see?

422
00:55:55.956 --> 00:55:57.748
No roots.

423
00:55:57.874 --> 00:56:01.627
If you really love it, you should plant it
in the park so it can have roots.

424
00:56:05.715 --> 00:56:09.510
I'm the one you should be watering
if you want me to grow.

425
00:56:10.929 --> 00:56:13.139
You're right.

426
00:56:18.645 --> 00:56:21.230
- No.
- Yes, yes, yes!

427
00:56:40.125 --> 00:56:43.502
They gotta be jumping out of the plate,
they gotta be alive.

428
00:56:52.554 --> 00:56:54.847
It's been a long time, Leon.

429
00:57:00.895 --> 00:57:02.646
I missed you.

430
00:57:02.772 --> 00:57:05.941
And you missed some nice jobs, too.

431
00:57:06.067 --> 00:57:08.694
- Been training.
- Training's good.

432
00:57:10.364 --> 00:57:14.116
But don't overdo it. You know training
don't pay as good as working, Leon.

433
00:57:14.242 --> 00:57:15.993
Tony. . .

434
00:57:18.830 --> 00:57:23.166
All the money I make. . .
that you keep for me.

435
00:57:23.292 --> 00:57:25.168
You need some money?

436
00:57:25.294 --> 00:57:26.879
No. Just curious.

437
00:57:27.005 --> 00:57:28.964
Because I've been working a long time

438
00:57:29.090 --> 00:57:31.800
and I haven't done anything
with my money. . .

439
00:57:34.888 --> 00:57:37.556
I thought maybe some day I could. . .

440
00:57:39.350 --> 00:57:40.559
. . .use it.

441
00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:44.354
You met a woman?

442
00:57:52.739 --> 00:57:55.407
Leon, you gotta be careful
with women.

443
00:57:55.534 --> 00:57:59.745
Remember when you arrived in
this country, Leon, when I took you in?

444
00:57:59.871 --> 00:58:02.205
You were still wet
behind the fucking ears,

445
00:58:02.331 --> 00:58:05.208
and already you were in deep shit
because of a woman.

446
00:58:05.334 --> 00:58:06.960
Don't forget that, Leon.

447
00:58:07.086 --> 00:58:09.254
Wish I could, sometimes.

448
00:58:12.884 --> 00:58:15.093
You know, about my money.

449
00:58:15.219 --> 00:58:20.390
Maybe I. . .
Maybe I could give. . .a little. . .

450
00:58:23.394 --> 00:58:25.520
. . .to someone.

451
00:58:25.647 --> 00:58:28.732
You know, to help out.

452
00:58:28.858 --> 00:58:35.322
Hey, it's your money, I mean,
I'm just holding it for you, like a bank.

453
00:58:35.448 --> 00:58:37.365
Except, you know, better than a bank,

454
00:58:37.491 --> 00:58:40.077
because banks are always
getting knocked off.

455
00:58:40.203 --> 00:58:42.120
And no one knocks off old Tony.

456
00:58:42.246 --> 00:58:44.790
And besides, with a bank,

457
00:58:44.916 --> 00:58:48.251
there's always tons of forms
to be filled and all that shit.

458
00:58:48.377 --> 00:58:51.213
But old Tony, nothing to read,
nothing to write.

459
00:58:52.381 --> 00:58:54.341
It's all in his head.

460
00:58:54.467 --> 00:58:56.634
I know how to read now.

461
00:58:58.721 --> 00:59:01.348
That's good, Leon.

462
00:59:01.474 --> 00:59:02.765
Good.

463
00:59:04.352 --> 00:59:05.853
Your money's here.

464
00:59:05.979 --> 00:59:09.231
Whenever you want it,
you just ask me, OK?

465
00:59:09.357 --> 00:59:11.316
- Here's a grand.
- It's OK. I don't need it.

466
00:59:11.442 --> 00:59:15.237
Come on, come on, take it.
Have some fun. Go ahead. Take it.

467
00:59:15.363 --> 00:59:17.030
Thank you.

468
00:59:17.156 --> 00:59:18.615
All right.

469
00:59:19.492 --> 00:59:23.120
Now let's talk business.
Don't move, I'll go get the file.

470
00:59:24.747 --> 00:59:27.957
Manolo, a glass of milk
for my friend Leon here!

471
00:59:52.108 --> 00:59:54.359
Listen, Mathilda, you gotta be careful.

472
00:59:54.485 --> 00:59:57.654
You can't just speak
to any guy off the street.

473
00:59:58.406 --> 01:00:01.158
Leon, get a grip.
What's the big fucking deal?

474
01:00:01.284 --> 01:00:04.411
I was just smoking a butt
while I was waiting.

475
01:00:05.829 --> 01:00:07.830
I want you to stop cursing.

476
01:00:07.956 --> 01:00:10.333
You can't talk to people
like that all the time.

477
01:00:10.459 --> 01:00:13.420
I want you to make
an effort to talk nice.

478
01:00:15.130 --> 01:00:16.464
OK.

479
01:00:18.175 --> 01:00:21.052
And I want you to stop smoking.
It will kill you.

480
01:00:23.472 --> 01:00:24.806
OK.

481
01:00:28.018 --> 01:00:30.978
Stay away from him,
he looks like a weirdo.

482
01:00:33.316 --> 01:00:34.566
OK.

483
01:00:35.984 --> 01:00:39.404
I'll be out in five minutes,
stand where I can see you.

484
01:00:41.031 --> 01:00:42.239
OK.

485
01:00:53.168 --> 01:00:56.463
Leon, I think I'm kind of falling
in love with you.

486
01:01:00.425 --> 01:01:03.219
It's the first time for me, you know?

487
01:01:03.721 --> 01:01:07.223
How do you know it's love
if you've never been in love before?

488
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:09.183
Cos I feel it.

489
01:01:10.644 --> 01:01:12.436
Where?

490
01:01:15.065 --> 01:01:16.858
In my stomach.

491
01:01:19.737 --> 01:01:21.445
It's all warm.

492
01:01:23.448 --> 01:01:28.077
I always had a knot there,
and now. . .it's gone.

493
01:01:31.414 --> 01:01:36.418
Mathilda, I'm glad you don't have
a stomach ache anymore.

494
01:01:36.544 --> 01:01:39.130
I don't think that means anything.

495
01:01:39.256 --> 01:01:42.591
I'm late for work.
I hate being late for work.

496
01:02:27.179 --> 01:02:29.638
Hey, how's the practicing going?

497
01:02:59.627 --> 01:03:04.506
- How are we today, Miss?
- A little sick of practicing.

498
01:03:04.632 --> 01:03:06.675
I understand.

499
01:03:06.801 --> 01:03:10.596
But you're doing all right.
I haven't received any complaints at all.

500
01:03:10.722 --> 01:03:14.933
Well, I put a cloth over
the strings to lessen the noise.

501
01:03:15.059 --> 01:03:17.603
Oh? Oh, that's very smart!

502
01:03:17.729 --> 01:03:20.731
- Not everyone loves music.
- I know.

503
01:03:22.567 --> 01:03:25.861
What exactly does your father do?

504
01:03:25.987 --> 01:03:29.323
- Well, he's a composer.
- Ah, that's wonderful.

505
01:03:30.492 --> 01:03:32.659
Except he's not really my father.

506
01:03:38.916 --> 01:03:40.334
He's my lover.

507
01:03:44.506 --> 01:03:46.632
I think I'll go for a walk.

508
01:04:02.607 --> 01:04:05.776
- What are you doing Saturday night?
- What about dinner?

509
01:04:06.528 --> 01:04:09.237
- Hey, where you going?
- Visiting friends at 6J.

510
01:04:09.363 --> 01:04:11.197
OK, right. . .

511
01:05:41.873 --> 01:05:45.000
We know you're a busy man and we'll
try to make this as short as possible.

512
01:05:45.126 --> 01:05:49.295
Now if you just take us step by step
through exactly what happened.

513
01:05:49.421 --> 01:05:52.298
The guy was here, he went for his gun.

514
01:05:52.424 --> 01:05:54.425
Bang! We shot him.

515
01:05:57.721 --> 01:06:00.556
- Where exactly were the kids?
- I don't know.

516
01:06:00.682 --> 01:06:03.226
They should've been at school,
don't you think?

517
01:06:03.352 --> 01:06:06.646
In your statement you said you were
the first man in, didn't you see any kids?

518
01:06:06.772 --> 01:06:10.733
The door was broken, what happened?
Did you follow the procedure?

519
01:06:11.777 --> 01:06:15.155
I lost a good man here.
What the fuck do you want with me?

520
01:06:15.281 --> 01:06:16.697
Cooperation.

521
01:06:21.162 --> 01:06:24.997
I haven't got time
for this Mickey Mouse bullshit.

522
01:06:25.124 --> 01:06:29.544
You want cooperation?
Come up my office. Room 4602.

523
01:06:40.972 --> 01:06:44.016
- Kids should be at school.
- Hey!

524
01:06:44.142 --> 01:06:46.227
Hey, come on, that's my ball!

525
01:06:46.687 --> 01:06:50.523
Hey, give that back!
Come on, where you going?

526
01:06:51.358 --> 01:06:54.277
Damn, where are you going, man?
That's my ball!

527
01:07:02.035 --> 01:07:03.453
Follow the blue car!

528
01:07:03.579 --> 01:07:06.706
I suppose you want me to blast
the music and go through lights.

529
01:07:06.832 --> 01:07:08.333
No. Drive slowly.

530
01:07:08.459 --> 01:07:11.210
Take the hundred bucks,
and shut the fuck up, OK?

531
01:08:11.104 --> 01:08:13.939
It's for you, a present.

532
01:08:16.818 --> 01:08:19.779
Do you want me to open it?
I'll open it.

533
01:08:24.868 --> 01:08:27.286
How do you like it? Nice, eh?

534
01:08:29.164 --> 01:08:30.831
Mr McGuffin?

535
01:08:34.002 --> 01:08:36.711
Can I have a word with you?

536
01:09:55.708 --> 01:09:59.002
Here. It's for a contract.
Twenty grand, right?

537
01:09:59.128 --> 01:10:01.796
His name is Norman Stansfield
and he's in room 4602

538
01:10:01.922 --> 01:10:05.133
in the DEA building, 26 Federal Plaza.

539
01:10:06.051 --> 01:10:08.553
- I'm not taking it.
- Why not?

540
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:11.473
Too heavy.

541
01:10:11.599 --> 01:10:13.392
Would you rent me your gear
for the day?

542
01:10:13.518 --> 01:10:16.227
I never lend out my gear.

543
01:10:16.354 --> 01:10:20.064
But you still have your gun.
Use it.

544
01:10:20.190 --> 01:10:23.568
Just do me a favor,
don't shoot out the window, OK?

545
01:10:23.694 --> 01:10:25.862
Why are you so mean to me?

546
01:10:27.657 --> 01:10:30.199
You're out there killing people
you don't give a shit about,

547
01:10:30.325 --> 01:10:33.202
but you won't get the bastards
who killed my whole family.

548
01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:39.626
Revenge is not good, Mathilda.
Believe, it's better to forget.

549
01:10:39.752 --> 01:10:40.960
To forget?

550
01:10:41.086 --> 01:10:43.672
After I've seen the outline
of my brother's body on the floor,

551
01:10:43.798 --> 01:10:45.840
you expect me to forget?

552
01:10:45.966 --> 01:10:50.053
I want to kill those sons of bitches.
I'm gonna blow their fucking heads off!

553
01:10:50.179 --> 01:10:52.972
Nothing's the same
after you've killed someone.

554
01:10:55.184 --> 01:10:57.519
Your life is changed forever.

555
01:10:59.855 --> 01:11:03.733
You'll have to sleep with one eye open
for the rest of your life.

556
01:11:03.859 --> 01:11:06.110
I don't give a shit about sleeping, Leon.

557
01:11:07.404 --> 01:11:10.574
I want love. . .or death.

558
01:11:12.618 --> 01:11:14.285
That's it.

559
01:11:15.996 --> 01:11:17.706
Love or death.

560
01:11:18.666 --> 01:11:22.001
Get off my case, Mathilda.
I'm tired of your games.

561
01:11:25.798 --> 01:11:28.049
It's a really great game, Leon.

562
01:11:28.175 --> 01:11:31.344
It makes people nicer
and starts them thinking.

563
01:11:35.975 --> 01:11:38.184
The kind of game you love.

564
01:11:50.697 --> 01:11:54.951
If I win, you keep me with you.

565
01:11:55.077 --> 01:11:57.161
For life.

566
01:11:58.789 --> 01:12:03.084
- And if you lose?
- You'll go shopping alone. Like before.

567
01:12:05.921 --> 01:12:08.047
You're gonna lose, Mathilda.

568
01:12:09.842 --> 01:12:12.718
There's a round in the chamber,
I heard it.

569
01:12:12.844 --> 01:12:14.178
So what?

570
01:12:14.304 --> 01:12:17.306
What's it to you if I end up
with a bullet in the head, huh?

571
01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:21.602
Nothing.

572
01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:27.816
I hope you're not lying, Leon.

573
01:12:29.069 --> 01:12:32.738
I really hope that down deep inside
there's no love in you.

574
01:12:35.409 --> 01:12:40.038
Cos if there is just a little bit
of love in you for me,

575
01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:47.628
I think that in a few minutes you're
gonna regret you never said anything.

576
01:12:56.263 --> 01:12:58.139
I love you, Leon.

577
01:13:15.156 --> 01:13:16.574
I win.

578
01:13:35.093 --> 01:13:38.429
I took a hit, I need a hand now.

579
01:13:39.848 --> 01:13:42.766
I know she's young,
but she learns fast.

580
01:13:44.478 --> 01:13:48.271
- Kids need to be shaped into something.
- Yeah, I know. I taught you that.

581
01:13:48.398 --> 01:13:51.484
- But ain't there an age limit?
- She's eighteen.

582
01:13:51.610 --> 01:13:53.235
Oh, really?

583
01:13:56.948 --> 01:13:59.032
How about something to drink, Tony?

584
01:13:59.158 --> 01:14:02.285
Yeah, sure.
Manolo, a glass of milk for Leon.

585
01:14:05.164 --> 01:14:06.790
Nice tattoo.

586
01:14:11.713 --> 01:14:14.464
Manolo! Make that two!

587
01:14:34.736 --> 01:14:37.487
- What's that for?
- Can't afford to catch cold.

588
01:14:38.823 --> 01:14:42.868
First you find out where the chain is.
You can't see it, but you can feel it.

589
01:14:42.994 --> 01:14:45.537
Here. I ring and you start talking.

590
01:14:45.664 --> 01:14:47.665
What do I say?

591
01:14:47.791 --> 01:14:49.582
Whatever you want.

592
01:14:52.211 --> 01:14:55.172
- Yes?
- Hi. It's Susan.

593
01:14:56.507 --> 01:15:00.593
Sorry, you must have the wrong door,
little girl. I don't know any Susan.

594
01:15:01.637 --> 01:15:04.556
Move back a little, I can't see anything.

595
01:15:05.558 --> 01:15:10.103
The light's out. It's all dark out here.

596
01:15:13.399 --> 01:15:15.859
Mister, I'm scared.

597
01:15:17.528 --> 01:15:19.112
OK, OK.

598
01:15:22.575 --> 01:15:24.492
What are you doing?

599
01:15:30.708 --> 01:15:32.167
Open up.

600
01:15:33.586 --> 01:15:37.005
If it leaves your mouth,
I pull the trigger, capiche?

601
01:16:14.252 --> 01:16:18.087
Here is OK. Let it go.
I said let it go.

602
01:16:18.922 --> 01:16:21.216
Move, move over.

603
01:16:23.010 --> 01:16:24.469
Easy, easy.

604
01:16:29.933 --> 01:16:31.893
Go ahead, your turn.

605
01:16:38.651 --> 01:16:41.152
Help me, please help me.

606
01:16:41.279 --> 01:16:43.780
Hello, sir. Sir. . .?

607
01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:48.910
Sir, sir, it's not my dope.

608
01:16:51.289 --> 01:16:53.373
A little left, please.

609
01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:03.591
Now the security shot.

610
01:17:08.806 --> 01:17:11.558
Oh, the second goes higher
on the chest.

611
01:17:11.684 --> 01:17:13.935
Aim for the heart and lungs.

612
01:17:14.061 --> 01:17:16.228
There, right there, you see?

613
01:17:16.354 --> 01:17:20.483
The first shot takes him out of order,
and the second finishes him off.

614
01:17:21.026 --> 01:17:22.777
Never in the face.

615
01:17:22.903 --> 01:17:25.780
If they can't recognize the client,
you don't get paid,

616
01:17:25.906 --> 01:17:29.534
cause you could take out anybody
and say you did the job.

617
01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:32.203
- Got it?
- Got it. Never in the face.

618
01:17:32.329 --> 01:17:36.916
- OK. Now you can put the tools away.
- What the fuck is going on?

619
01:17:37.042 --> 01:17:38.375
Hey, mister!

620
01:17:44.007 --> 01:17:46.634
You see,
when you use the silencer a lot,

621
01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:48.886
you have to put
a piece of cloth here,

622
01:17:49.012 --> 01:17:51.973
because it gets very hot
and could burn it inside.

623
01:17:52.099 --> 01:17:54.475
A damp, black cloth is the best.

624
01:17:58.105 --> 01:18:00.022
What are you doing?

625
01:18:01.149 --> 01:18:03.359
We said no women, no kids.

626
01:18:03.485 --> 01:18:07.071
Who do you think this is gonna kill?
Donkeys and monkeys?

627
01:18:22.670 --> 01:18:24.922
Now it's clean.

628
01:18:27.175 --> 01:18:28.885
Let's get out of here.

629
01:18:42.357 --> 01:18:45.484
I thought we don't have
the right to drink.

630
01:18:45.610 --> 01:18:48.487
I know, but we're making
an exception for your first client.

631
01:18:50.532 --> 01:18:53.910
Well, if we're making exceptions
for a job well done,

632
01:18:55.996 --> 01:18:58.747
how about a kiss, like in the movies?

633
01:19:01.084 --> 01:19:02.918
No.

634
01:19:03.711 --> 01:19:05.254
Yes.

635
01:19:07.257 --> 01:19:09.758
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna kiss you.

636
01:19:09.884 --> 01:19:13.679
- Mathilda, stop please.
- Come on, just a kiss.

637
01:19:13.805 --> 01:19:16.473
Stop, everyone is watching us.

638
01:19:19.061 --> 01:19:20.894
Basta, go sit down.

639
01:19:29.070 --> 01:19:31.113
Enjoy.

640
01:19:37.078 --> 01:19:39.538
- You don't believe me, do you?
- How's that?

641
01:19:39.664 --> 01:19:41.957
When I say I'm in love with you.

642
01:19:42.083 --> 01:19:46.212
Mathilda, please, drop it.
Just change the subject, OK?

643
01:19:46.338 --> 01:19:48.004
OK, OK, sorry.

644
01:19:49.716 --> 01:19:53.802
So how old were you
when you made your first hit?

645
01:19:53.928 --> 01:19:55.429
Nineteen.

646
01:19:57.265 --> 01:19:58.724
Beat ya!

647
01:21:02.622 --> 01:21:04.581
What are you doing?

648
01:21:04.707 --> 01:21:06.750
Can't afford to catch cold.

649
01:21:54.173 --> 01:21:56.632
- There's no doorbell?
- So knock on the door.

650
01:22:01.555 --> 01:22:02.889
Yes?

651
01:22:03.015 --> 01:22:07.310
Hi, I'm looking for
Mr Rubens' apartment,

652
01:22:07.436 --> 01:22:10.730
but it's all dark out here
in the hall and I'm lost.

653
01:22:11.607 --> 01:22:12.857
Just a second.

654
01:22:25.037 --> 01:22:28.123
You want more?
Come on, show your fucking face!

655
01:22:28.249 --> 01:22:31.167
Think you're gonna get me that easily?

656
01:22:36.382 --> 01:22:39.092
When it tough like this,
you know it's gonna be ugly.

657
01:22:39.218 --> 01:22:43.179
Better make it quick, or else we'll be
here all day listening to his crap.

658
01:22:43.305 --> 01:22:46.099
Asshole!
Show me your fucking face, faggot!

659
01:22:46.225 --> 01:22:47.558
Come on, "gum trick"!

660
01:22:47.684 --> 01:22:51.103
Hey. What about the "ring trick"?

661
01:22:51.230 --> 01:22:53.689
- You know that one?
- "Ring trick"? Come on, asshole.

662
01:22:53.815 --> 01:22:56.192
I'm waiting.
Show it to me, motherfucker.

663
01:23:05.994 --> 01:23:08.162
That's the "ring trick".

664
01:23:22.803 --> 01:23:26.221
Mario, go back to the barber shop,
we'll finish later.

665
01:23:37.484 --> 01:23:40.945
Hey, Leon, what's up?
All done already?

666
01:23:41.071 --> 01:23:42.697
No, no.

667
01:23:43.824 --> 01:23:45.825
Nicer than people, eh?

668
01:23:46.743 --> 01:23:48.536
I told you that.

669
01:23:50.956 --> 01:23:52.915
- You got a problem?
- No.

670
01:23:55.794 --> 01:23:59.046
Get the chair, sit down. Sit.

671
01:24:02.968 --> 01:24:06.596
I was thinking. . .

672
01:24:09.558 --> 01:24:13.352
If something happens to me
some day. . .

673
01:24:13.478 --> 01:24:17.189
Hey, Leon,
nothing's gonna happen to you.

674
01:24:17.315 --> 01:24:20.275
You're indestructible,
bullets slide off you, you play with them.

675
01:24:20.401 --> 01:24:24.488
Tony, I thought about my money.

676
01:24:28.118 --> 01:24:33.288
You remember the girl
who came here the other day?

677
01:24:34.666 --> 01:24:36.166
Yeah.

678
01:24:37.669 --> 01:24:41.881
Her name is. . .Mathilda.

679
01:24:42.924 --> 01:24:46.802
If anything happens to me, I. . .

680
01:24:49.055 --> 01:24:52.767
I'd like you to give her. . .

681
01:24:55.937 --> 01:24:57.437
. . .my money.

682
01:25:00.859 --> 01:25:03.360
You can count on me, Leon.

683
01:25:03.486 --> 01:25:05.863
- Thank you, Tony.
- Yeah.

684
01:25:09.284 --> 01:25:11.076
I won't be long.

685
01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:15.164
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

686
01:25:16.791 --> 01:25:19.751
This one is too big.

687
01:25:19.878 --> 01:25:23.255
Yeah, and I only get the leftovers,
is that it?

688
01:25:25.633 --> 01:25:30.262
Mathilda, since I met you,
everything's been different.

689
01:25:30.388 --> 01:25:34.183
So I just need some time alone.

690
01:25:37.645 --> 01:25:40.147
And you need some time
to grow up a little.

691
01:25:40.273 --> 01:25:44.359
I've finished growing up, Leon.
I just get older.

692
01:25:44.485 --> 01:25:47.362
And for me, it's the opposite.
I'm old enough. . .

693
01:25:49.574 --> 01:25:51.616
. . . I need time to grow up.

694
01:26:06.841 --> 01:26:08.258
Shit.

695
01:27:33.427 --> 01:27:37.764
You're new, aren't you? Fifth floor, right?
Well, you can't sit here like that.

696
01:27:37.890 --> 01:27:40.058
- Really? Why not?
- Nothing's free.

697
01:27:40.184 --> 01:27:44.562
Like a parking meter.
When you stop, you pay. It's the law.

698
01:27:44.689 --> 01:27:46.648
- Only on TV.
- What did you say?

699
01:27:46.774 --> 01:27:51.527
- Forget it. How much is your meter?
- Ten dollars. . .a month.

700
01:27:54.531 --> 01:27:56.032
Got change?

701
01:27:57.702 --> 01:28:00.119
Don't worry about it,
we'll do ten for twelve.

702
01:28:00.245 --> 01:28:02.747
I'll pay now
for the rest of the year, OK?

703
01:28:02.873 --> 01:28:04.791
OK, a year.

704
01:28:04.917 --> 01:28:07.919
Does paying rent here mean
I have to put up with you guys?

705
01:28:09.296 --> 01:28:10.629
No.

706
01:28:10.756 --> 01:28:13.049
So go play somewhere else.

707
01:28:16.971 --> 01:28:18.805
I need to think.

708
01:29:17.156 --> 01:29:19.698
Stand up. Don't you like your job?

709
01:29:29.459 --> 01:29:30.876
Food.

710
01:29:34.381 --> 01:29:36.257
Where are you going?

711
01:29:36.383 --> 01:29:39.218
Special delivery. Room 4602.

712
01:29:39.344 --> 01:29:40.886
Sign in.

713
01:29:45.767 --> 01:29:47.518
Have a nice weekend, girls.

714
01:31:11.352 --> 01:31:14.772
Special delivery, huh? Let me guess. . .

715
01:31:17.441 --> 01:31:18.901
Chinese?

716
01:31:22.071 --> 01:31:23.864
Thai, maybe?

717
01:31:26.910 --> 01:31:28.743
I've got it.

718
01:31:29.662 --> 01:31:31.663
Italian food.

719
01:31:48.681 --> 01:31:50.473
What's your name, angel?

720
01:31:51.309 --> 01:31:54.811
Mathilda.

721
01:32:17.210 --> 01:32:18.751
Mathilda. . .

722
01:32:20.546 --> 01:32:23.631
I want you to put the sack on the floor.

723
01:32:29.222 --> 01:32:30.638
Good.

724
01:32:33.309 --> 01:32:38.105
Now I want you to tell me everything
you know about Italian food.

725
01:32:38.231 --> 01:32:41.191
And don't forget the name
of the chef who fixed for me.

726
01:32:42.025 --> 01:32:45.903
Nobody sent me.
I do business for myself.

727
01:32:48.241 --> 01:32:50.367
So this is something. . .

728
01:32:52.203 --> 01:32:54.621
. . .personal, is it?

729
01:32:58.626 --> 01:33:03.921
What filthy piece of shit
did I do now?

730
01:33:05.674 --> 01:33:08.050
You killed my brother.

731
01:33:11.972 --> 01:33:13.515
I'm sorry.

732
01:33:22.274 --> 01:33:24.359
And you wanna join him?

733
01:33:27.488 --> 01:33:28.821
No.

734
01:33:28.947 --> 01:33:31.282
It's always the same thing.

735
01:33:36.997 --> 01:33:40.417
It's when you start to become
really afraid of death,

736
01:33:41.919 --> 01:33:44.921
that you learn to appreciate life.

737
01:33:46.423 --> 01:33:49.551
Do you like life, sweetheart?

738
01:33:52.345 --> 01:33:53.763
Yes.

739
01:33:57.601 --> 01:33:59.686
That's good.

740
01:34:03.649 --> 01:34:06.442
Because I take no pleasure. . .

741
01:34:08.737 --> 01:34:10.780
. . .in taking life. . .

742
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:15.201
. . .if it's from a person
who doesn't care about it.

743
01:34:25.503 --> 01:34:27.421
Stan!

744
01:34:28.423 --> 01:34:31.258
Shit, Stan. I've been looking
all over for you, man.

745
01:34:31.384 --> 01:34:33.260
What? I'm busy.

746
01:34:34.179 --> 01:34:36.180
It's Malky, man. He's dead.

747
01:34:38.391 --> 01:34:41.602
Malky was making a buy for us
from the Chinamen.

748
01:34:41.729 --> 01:34:44.563
But they got nothing to do with it, man.

749
01:34:44.689 --> 01:34:48.359
They told me,
this guy came from the outside.

750
01:34:48.485 --> 01:34:53.114
He was a pro. He was fast.
He fucking came outta nowhere.

751
01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:56.658
Boom. Shoots the Chinamen
dead in two seconds.

752
01:34:57.410 --> 01:35:00.329
Easy, man. I'm a cop.

753
01:35:00.455 --> 01:35:03.290
Then turns around,
says something to Malky like. . .

754
01:35:03.416 --> 01:35:05.542
No women, no kids.

755
01:35:13.593 --> 01:35:16.012
I think it was something personal.

756
01:35:18.265 --> 01:35:22.559
Death is. . .whimsical today.

757
01:35:50.130 --> 01:35:53.799
Blood, you hear me?

758
01:35:53.925 --> 01:35:56.968
Yeah, man, I hear you, Stan.
Just chill out, man.

759
01:35:58.513 --> 01:36:01.140
Would you take her up
to my office?

760
01:36:02.559 --> 01:36:04.351
All right, yeah.

761
01:36:12.402 --> 01:36:14.570
Jesus fucking Christ!

762
01:36:26.916 --> 01:36:30.836
"Leon, my love. I know where to find
the guys who killed my brother.

763
01:36:30.962 --> 01:36:35.632
"Their boss is Norman Stansfield and
he's in the DEA building, room 4602.

764
01:36:35.758 --> 01:36:37.759
"I'm gonna do them myself.

765
01:36:37.885 --> 01:36:41.513
"If something goes wrong,
I left you twenty grand on the table.

766
01:36:41.639 --> 01:36:44.265
"It's for a contract.
Five grand a head, right?

767
01:36:45.685 --> 01:36:48.311
"I know I'll feel better after I do this.

768
01:36:49.689 --> 01:36:52.232
"I love you - Mathilda."

769
01:36:56.654 --> 01:36:58.447
Wait for me. I won't be long.

770
01:36:58.573 --> 01:37:01.783
I can't park in front like this,
it's a federal building!

771
01:37:06.413 --> 01:37:09.708
She's gonna do the same exact thing
like I said. . .

772
01:37:09.834 --> 01:37:11.292
Nine-milli,

773
01:37:12.754 --> 01:37:16.089
bullets and another nine-milli.

774
01:37:19.636 --> 01:37:21.553
What did you plan to do
with all these guns?

775
01:37:21.679 --> 01:37:24.598
Maybe she was planning
on taking out the whole building.

776
01:37:28.811 --> 01:37:32.355
Holy shit! What've we got here? Lunch.

777
01:37:35.067 --> 01:37:36.943
Careful, Blood. Might be poisoned.

778
01:37:37.069 --> 01:37:39.112
No, man, there's no anchovies on this.

779
01:37:56.588 --> 01:38:01.176
Is that what you call "I won't be long"?
I've been hangin' around for 10 minutes!

780
01:38:01.302 --> 01:38:03.094
I did my best. Avanti.

781
01:38:50.976 --> 01:38:53.686
Do you like it?

782
01:38:53.812 --> 01:38:55.313
Yes.

783
01:38:55.981 --> 01:38:57.523
So say it.

784
01:39:00.527 --> 01:39:02.070
I like it.

785
01:39:17.127 --> 01:39:19.462
Not thirsty?

786
01:39:27.429 --> 01:39:30.640
You know, a girl's first time
is very important.

787
01:39:30.766 --> 01:39:33.726
It determines
the rest of her life sexually.

788
01:39:33.852 --> 01:39:37.062
I read that once
in one of my sister's magazines.

789
01:39:37.188 --> 01:39:40.608
My girlfriends told me that
they hated their first experience.

790
01:39:41.860 --> 01:39:44.695
That's because
they don't love their guys.

791
01:39:46.407 --> 01:39:48.408
They just did it to show off.

792
01:39:48.534 --> 01:39:51.619
Afterwards, they started liking it,
like cigarettes.

793
01:39:56.375 --> 01:39:59.126
I wanna like it the first time.

794
01:40:03.214 --> 01:40:04.882
Mathilda, no.

795
01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:09.344
Why not?

796
01:40:09.471 --> 01:40:11.221
I just can't.

797
01:40:12.766 --> 01:40:16.727
- You love someone else?
- No. I mean. . .

798
01:40:21.608 --> 01:40:23.943
There was someone a long time ago.

799
01:40:25.529 --> 01:40:27.905
Before I came to the States.

800
01:40:28.031 --> 01:40:31.033
Her father didn't want her
to see me.

801
01:40:32.410 --> 01:40:35.245
She was from a very respectable family.

802
01:40:37.082 --> 01:40:40.042
Mine was, you know. . .

803
01:40:42.921 --> 01:40:44.714
. . .not so respectable.

804
01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:48.801
Her dad went nuts
every time she'd take off to see me.

805
01:40:48.927 --> 01:40:51.053
But she still snuck off
to see you, right?

806
01:40:52.848 --> 01:40:54.181
Right.

807
01:40:54.307 --> 01:40:56.642
You see, nothing can stop love, Leon.

808
01:40:59.354 --> 01:41:03.023
He killed her.
One shot to the head.

809
01:41:07.403 --> 01:41:11.198
They kept him in jail for two days,
then they let him go free.

810
01:41:13.451 --> 01:41:15.828
They said it was an accident.

811
01:41:17.956 --> 01:41:19.248
So. . .

812
01:41:21.251 --> 01:41:24.628
. . .one night I waited for him.

813
01:41:26.965 --> 01:41:28.966
500 feet with a lens.

814
01:41:32.178 --> 01:41:34.054
He also had an accident.

815
01:41:35.223 --> 01:41:37.641
The same night I took a boat

816
01:41:37.767 --> 01:41:43.188
and came here to meet up with
my father who was working for Tony.

817
01:41:43.314 --> 01:41:45.190
I was nineteen.

818
01:41:49.362 --> 01:41:52.864
Since then,
I've never left the city and. . .

819
01:41:56.786 --> 01:41:59.246
. . . I've never had another girlfriend.

820
01:42:02.292 --> 01:42:07.046
You see, Mathilda,
I won't be a good lover.

821
01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:10.757
OK.

822
01:42:14.262 --> 01:42:16.430
Just do me one favor.

823
01:42:16.556 --> 01:42:18.098
What?

824
01:42:18.224 --> 01:42:20.475
I'm sick of watching you
sleeping on your chair.

825
01:42:20.601 --> 01:42:22.602
We're gonna share the bed.

826
01:42:23.646 --> 01:42:26.106
I don't think it's a good idea.

827
01:42:27.358 --> 01:42:30.860
It's OK, put your legs up on the bed.

828
01:42:30.986 --> 01:42:33.112
Yeah, it's nice.

829
01:42:38.161 --> 01:42:40.787
Put your head down. It's OK. Relax.

830
01:43:02.477 --> 01:43:04.311
Goodnight, Leon.

831
01:43:07.357 --> 01:43:08.940
Goodnight.

832
01:43:40.139 --> 01:43:42.807
Manolo, take the kids in the kitchen.

833
01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:05.246
I have a lot of respect
for your business, Tony.

834
01:44:05.372 --> 01:44:08.041
When you've killed for us
in the past,

835
01:44:08.167 --> 01:44:11.460
we've always been satisfied.

836
01:44:11.586 --> 01:44:13.546
And that's exactly why today

837
01:44:13.673 --> 01:44:16.340
is going to be very, very hard for me.

838
01:44:17.342 --> 01:44:19.678
I hope you'll excuse my mood.

839
01:44:23.473 --> 01:44:27.351
My man was killed
right here on your turf,

840
01:44:27.477 --> 01:44:31.856
and the Chinks tell me
that the hitman was kind of the. . .

841
01:44:33.275 --> 01:44:34.442
. . . Italian type.

842
01:44:34.568 --> 01:44:38.362
So we figured that
Tony might know something.

843
01:44:38.488 --> 01:44:43.284
Wait, there's more.
You're gonna love this.

844
01:44:45.495 --> 01:44:46.913
A few hours later,

845
01:44:48.290 --> 01:44:52.085
a little twelve-year-old girl comes
into my office, armed to the teeth,

846
01:44:52.211 --> 01:44:55.629
with the firm intention of sending me
straight to the morgue.

847
01:44:55.755 --> 01:44:57.840
And you know who came and got her
in the middle of the afternoon,

848
01:44:57.967 --> 01:45:00.634
right there in my building?

849
01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:04.597
The very same Italian hitman.

850
01:45:09.894 --> 01:45:11.937
I'm dying to meet him.

851
01:45:16.776 --> 01:45:18.902
Relax, everything's fine.

852
01:45:20.364 --> 01:45:23.741
- Sleep well?
- I never really sleep.

853
01:45:23.867 --> 01:45:26.410
- Got one eye open always.
- Oh, I forgot.

854
01:45:27.704 --> 01:45:32.208
You know, I never saw someone
with one eye open snore so much.

855
01:45:32.334 --> 01:45:34.335
- I snore?
- Like a baby.

856
01:45:36.671 --> 01:45:39.673
I'm gonna go get some milk
for breakfast. I won't be long.

857
01:45:39.799 --> 01:45:41.592
Don't forget the code
when you come back.

858
01:45:41.718 --> 01:45:44.345
Two knocks, then one,
and two knocks again, right?

859
01:45:44.471 --> 01:45:45.888
Right.

860
01:46:04.408 --> 01:46:07.826
Hola, señor. Ring these up
and I'll go get some milk.

861
01:46:29.474 --> 01:46:31.350
From here on out,
you don't make a sound.

862
01:46:31.476 --> 01:46:35.813
Answer my questions by nodding "yes"
or shaking your head "no", you got it?

863
01:46:35.939 --> 01:46:37.898
Is he alone?

864
01:46:38.024 --> 01:46:40.192
Does he expect you?

865
01:46:40.318 --> 01:46:42.903
Do you have keys to the apartment?

866
01:46:43.572 --> 01:46:47.115
Is there a code, a way of knocking
so he knows it's you?

867
01:47:35.164 --> 01:47:36.331
Alpha team.

868
01:47:36.457 --> 01:47:38.666
Final position, we're ready to go.

869
01:47:38.793 --> 01:47:40.043
Be careful.

870
01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:29.384
Move, move!

871
01:48:35.808 --> 01:48:37.434
Shit.

872
01:48:38.894 --> 01:48:40.853
Alpha team. Men down, men down.

873
01:48:42.190 --> 01:48:44.274
I told you.

874
01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:45.817
Benny. . .

875
01:48:48.154 --> 01:48:50.863
- Bring me everyone.
- What do you mean, "everyone"?

876
01:48:50.989 --> 01:48:53.325
Everyone!

877
01:49:47.212 --> 01:49:48.755
Take this.

878
01:49:55.012 --> 01:49:56.763
Go take a look.

879
01:50:12.154 --> 01:50:14.363
Don't move.

880
01:50:14.490 --> 01:50:16.365
You see anything?

881
01:50:17.325 --> 01:50:20.537
It's the guy. He's here.
He's got a gun at my head.

882
01:50:24.499 --> 01:50:25.917
OK, nobody moves.

883
01:50:26.043 --> 01:50:28.210
Let the girl go.

884
01:50:28.336 --> 01:50:31.255
- Take it easy, man!
- Let the girl go!

885
01:50:31.381 --> 01:50:34.008
OK. The girl's coming out.

886
01:50:34.134 --> 01:50:36.218
Let the girl go.

887
01:50:44.895 --> 01:50:48.147
Grab the ax off the wall.
Over there, go.

888
01:50:51.526 --> 01:50:53.569
You're coming with us.

889
01:51:05.833 --> 01:51:07.583
Christ, he shot him!

890
01:51:09.044 --> 01:51:11.003
Bastard!

891
01:51:21.431 --> 01:51:23.515
Move! Move! Move! Move!

892
01:51:26.103 --> 01:51:28.145
- Shut the fucking water off!
- Got it.

893
01:51:31.524 --> 01:51:35.194
We're in a bad way here.
Send the Cats, I repeat, send the Cats.

894
01:51:45.163 --> 01:51:49.000
I don't know what happened,
I didn't see them coming, I swear.

895
01:51:50.043 --> 01:51:54.380
I just went shopping and I came back
and they were everywhere.

896
01:51:57.009 --> 01:51:58.550
Stay away from the window.

897
01:52:26.454 --> 01:52:27.871
Leon?

898
01:52:44.764 --> 01:52:46.307
Come here.

899
01:52:48.851 --> 01:52:50.268
Snipers.

900
01:52:53.147 --> 01:52:56.232
OK, now get this fucking asshole
outta there.

901
01:53:14.001 --> 01:53:17.796
- How we gonna get outta here now?
- Leave it to me. We're checking out.

902
01:54:18.357 --> 01:54:21.985
But Leon, it's not big enough for you.
It's barely big enough for me.

903
01:54:22.111 --> 01:54:27.240
- We said no discussion.
- No! I'm not letting. . . I'm not going!

904
01:54:27.366 --> 01:54:32.328
- I won't go! I won't go!
- Listen to me. . . Listen to me.

905
01:54:32.454 --> 01:54:35.665
We have no chance together,
but if I'm alone I can do it. Trust me.

906
01:54:35.791 --> 01:54:39.920
I'm in good shape, Mathilda. And I know
I've got a lot of money with Tony, a lot.

907
01:54:40.046 --> 01:54:43.548
We'll take it and leave together,
just the two of us, OK? Go.

908
01:54:43.674 --> 01:54:47.552
No! You're just saying that
so I won't worry.

909
01:54:51.515 --> 01:54:54.976
- I don't wanna lose you, Leon.
- You're not going to lose me.

910
01:54:55.102 --> 01:54:56.937
You've given me a taste for life.

911
01:54:57.063 --> 01:55:00.356
I want to be happy,
sleep in a bed, have roots.

912
01:55:00.482 --> 01:55:02.525
You'll never be alone again, Mathilda.

913
01:55:05.904 --> 01:55:09.074
Please, go now, baby, go!

914
01:55:11.202 --> 01:55:15.413
Calm down, go now. Go, go.

915
01:55:16.373 --> 01:55:20.335
See you at Tony's. I'm gonna
clean them all. Tony's in an hour.

916
01:55:26.592 --> 01:55:28.218
I love you, Mathilda.

917
01:55:28.344 --> 01:55:30.511
I love you too, Leon.

918
01:56:05.756 --> 01:56:07.923
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
what the fuck is going on up there?

919
01:56:08.049 --> 01:56:10.885
I just said take the guy out,
not the whole fucking building.

920
01:56:31.197 --> 01:56:33.240
Hey, we got one breathing here.

921
01:56:35.201 --> 01:56:37.453
Get the medic on the horn.

922
01:56:45.879 --> 01:56:48.130
We got a wounded man here.
Make way!

923
01:56:48.256 --> 01:56:50.550
Send him down by the stairs!

924
01:56:52.343 --> 01:56:54.595
Let's go! Move!

925
01:56:54.721 --> 01:56:59.141
Get that guy up the stairs. Leave him
on the landing. Get your team back here.

926
01:57:00.060 --> 01:57:02.812
We got two men
coming down the stairs.

927
01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:28.628
You OK?
Hey, I need a medic over here!

928
01:57:28.755 --> 01:57:30.672
Move your fucking asses.

929
01:57:30.799 --> 01:57:33.300
Squad number one,
what's the status on the apartment?

930
01:57:33.426 --> 01:57:35.886
Can't see shit, too much smoke.
Give us five minutes to clear it out.

931
01:57:36.012 --> 01:57:37.221
OK, you got it.

932
01:57:37.347 --> 01:57:40.891
What? You're 200 men and
you can't find one man and a girl?

933
01:57:41.017 --> 01:57:42.559
Did you find the girl?

934
01:57:51.862 --> 01:57:54.404
Hi, how're you doing?
Take your mask off, quick.

935
01:57:57.408 --> 01:58:01.453
Let me see you.
That's deep. Right, this one here.

936
01:58:01.579 --> 01:58:04.706
- You from the third precinct?
- Yeah.

937
01:58:13.716 --> 01:58:16.760
All right, fine. Put it down. This one.

938
01:58:33.611 --> 01:58:35.737
You stay there for two minutes,
I'll be right back.

939
01:58:35.863 --> 01:58:39.199
Let me put the mask back on.
I breathe better with it.

940
01:58:39.325 --> 01:58:42.077
OK, you're right. Sit tight.

941
01:58:49.084 --> 01:58:51.211
OK, come on, everybody out.

942
01:58:51.337 --> 01:58:54.256
Come on, let's go, let's go!
Come on, out!

943
01:59:18.698 --> 01:59:21.325
Clear the way. Clear the way, men.

944
01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:33.462
Come on, what are you doing here?
Get out. Come on.

945
02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:26.908
Stansfield?

946
02:01:27.617 --> 02:01:29.118
At your service.

947
02:01:37.752 --> 02:01:41.297
This is. . .from. . .

948
02:01:47.929 --> 02:01:50.013
. . .Mathilda.

949
02:02:06.156 --> 02:02:08.199
Shit.

950
02:02:33.308 --> 02:02:37.978
Leon asked me to help you out if. . .
if something happened.

951
02:02:38.938 --> 02:02:41.440
And I think something happened, right?

952
02:02:41.566 --> 02:02:43.942
He put aside a little cash for you.

953
02:02:44.068 --> 02:02:49.615
So, what I'm suggesting is that
seeing as how you're still so young,

954
02:02:49.741 --> 02:02:52.826
I should hold the money for you,
you know, till you're older.

955
02:02:52.952 --> 02:02:55.788
Like a bank, you know,
except better than a bank,

956
02:02:55.914 --> 02:02:59.207
cos, you know,
banks always get knocked off.

957
02:02:59.333 --> 02:03:01.835
No one knocks off old Tony.

958
02:03:01.961 --> 02:03:04.797
But it's your money
and, in the meantime,

959
02:03:04.923 --> 02:03:08.842
all you gotta do is come here
every once in a while

960
02:03:08.968 --> 02:03:12.555
and I'll dish it out
so that you can have a little fun, OK?

961
02:03:14.223 --> 02:03:18.686
Here. . .here's a hundred bucks
to start with.

962
02:03:18.812 --> 02:03:20.563
Can't I get a job instead?

963
02:03:20.689 --> 02:03:22.648
A job?

964
02:03:24.526 --> 02:03:27.485
- What the hell can you do?
- I can clean.

965
02:03:28.863 --> 02:03:31.323
I ain't got no work for a 12-year-old kid.

966
02:03:31.449 --> 02:03:36.286
So get it outta your goddamn head!
It's over, the game's over!

967
02:03:36.412 --> 02:03:40.123
Leon's dead! You hear me?

968
02:03:48.382 --> 02:03:53.053
Come on. Come on,
you think I ain't hurting, too?

969
02:03:58.685 --> 02:04:01.103
But he's dead.

970
02:04:01.229 --> 02:04:03.480
And you're gonna forget
all this craziness

971
02:04:03.606 --> 02:04:06.566
and get your little ass
back to school, capiche?

972
02:04:06.692 --> 02:04:09.527
Now take this money
and get the hell outta here,

973
02:04:09.653 --> 02:04:11.738
and don't let me see your face
till next month.

974
02:04:11.865 --> 02:04:16.076
Cos something tells me I'm about
to lose my famous kind streak.

975
02:05:07.128 --> 02:05:09.003
My parents. . .

976
02:05:11.340 --> 02:05:15.302
. . .died in a car accident
four weeks ago.

977
02:05:17.805 --> 02:05:19.389
It was terrible.

978
02:05:22.143 --> 02:05:27.314
We didn't have the time to get to know
one another when you first came here,

979
02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:30.525
but I'm not the kind of woman
who'd let down a child,

980
02:05:30.651 --> 02:05:33.903
whatever her situation,
whatever her mistake.

981
02:05:34.029 --> 02:05:39.075
So I'm going to help you and
do my best to welcome you here again.

982
02:05:41.204 --> 02:05:43.621
But on one condition.

983
02:05:43.747 --> 02:05:47.041
You have to stop lying to me, Mathilda.

984
02:05:47.167 --> 02:05:50.753
I want you to take a chance
and trust me.

985
02:05:52.255 --> 02:05:54.757
Now tell me what happened to you.

986
02:05:55.884 --> 02:05:57.302
OK.

987
02:05:58.471 --> 02:06:03.015
My family got shot down by DEA officers
because of a drug problem.

988
02:06:05.102 --> 02:06:07.604
I lived with the greatest guy on earth.

989
02:06:07.730 --> 02:06:10.940
He was a hitman, the best in town.

990
02:06:11.066 --> 02:06:16.195
But he died this morning, and if you
don't help me, I'll be dead by tonight.

991
02:06:35.633 --> 02:06:37.383
You know her?

992
02:06:37.510 --> 02:06:40.469
- No.
- I've never seen her.

993
02:07:05.996 --> 02:07:09.040
I think we'll be OK here, Leon.
