WEBVTT

1
00:00:06,249 --> 00:00:08,610
When I said I wanted
this place to be campier,

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,820
this isn't what I meant.

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,565
We're just preparing for our
family's greatest tradition...

4
00:00:12,575 --> 00:00:14,209
The Cook Family Camping Trip

5
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,954
to the Delaware Water Gap
National Recreation Area.

6
00:00:16,964 --> 00:00:19,730
A family camping trip?

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,621
To the Delaware Water Gap
National Recreation Area.

8
00:00:22,631 --> 00:00:24,690
We've doing it
as long as I can remember.

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,725
- Yeah.
- Well, not the whole family.

10
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,419
- Mom always refused to go.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Later we found out

11
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,111
she was using that time
to have an affair.

12
00:00:31,122 --> 00:00:32,643
Anyway, we thought it'd be great for us,

13
00:00:32,654 --> 00:00:33,999
since this is how
we bonded with our dad.

14
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:35,601
It was the one time he
told me he loved me.

15
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:37,403
I saved his beers from a flash flood.

16
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:40,177
And out in the woods, there's actual
skills that I can pass on to you,

17
00:00:40,188 --> 00:00:42,575
since there's no point in me teaching
you how to take off a girl's bra.

18
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:44,376
You ask her to do it.

19
00:00:44,386 --> 00:00:47,479
Cool! A whole weekend with no privacy

20
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:49,982
and no cell phone reception.

21
00:00:49,992 --> 00:00:51,283
It's good to face your fears.

22
00:00:51,293 --> 00:00:52,825
Now go ahead and roll up your sleeve.

23
00:00:52,836 --> 00:00:56,121
I think it's best if we just get
the rabies shot done in advance.

24
00:00:56,131 --> 00:00:57,289
Yeah.

25
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:10,336
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

26
00:01:11,046 --> 00:01:12,972
- Guys, it's here!

27
00:01:12,982 --> 00:01:14,573
It is finally here.

28
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:17,142
I just saw Matthew hook himself
with a fishing line.

29
00:01:17,152 --> 00:01:18,677
You know what that means!

30
00:01:18,687 --> 00:01:21,547
It's Vincemas!

31
00:01:22,725 --> 00:01:23,763
Vincemas?

32
00:01:23,774 --> 00:01:25,459
Is someone going to
explain this to me, or

33
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,791
is this gonna be another
one of those office mysteries

34
00:01:26,802 --> 00:01:27,873
that I have to figure out?

35
00:01:27,884 --> 00:01:30,084
Like, "Why is there an old gun
in the kitchen freezer?"

36
00:01:30,095 --> 00:01:32,357
Every year,
Vince and Matthew go camping,

37
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:34,560
and with Nurse Ratched gone,

38
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,129
the inmates go in-sane-ey-ane!

39
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:40,256
I'm more confused.

40
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,368
We call it Vincemas, or Vince-madan...

41
00:01:42,378 --> 00:01:43,902
It's Vincemas.

42
00:01:43,912 --> 00:01:45,571
Irregardless, it's the
one day of the year

43
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:48,240
we get to celebrate all
the things Vince won't let us:

44
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,581
holidays, birthdays,

45
00:01:49,592 --> 00:01:53,162
and my funeral for the Oscars
after "La La Land" -gate.

46
00:01:53,173 --> 00:01:55,699
When I tried to celebrate
Selena Gomez's birthday,

47
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,365
Vince called it ludicrous.

48
00:01:57,376 --> 00:02:00,396
And then he called my party
for Ludacris' birthday stupid.

49
00:02:00,407 --> 00:02:02,821
For one weekend, we follow Ruby's rules.

50
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,690
Rule number one, there are no rules.

51
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,559
Rule number two, ignore rule number one.

52
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:09,194
Rule number three!

53
00:02:09,204 --> 00:02:10,562
No drunk driving.

54
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:11,764
- Seriously.
- Yeah.

55
00:02:11,774 --> 00:02:13,298
Okay. Well, I guess if I can

56
00:02:13,308 --> 00:02:15,017
bring my boyfriend, Asher,
it could be fun.

57
00:02:15,028 --> 00:02:17,153
He always does The Worm.

58
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:18,563
- Always.
- No!

59
00:02:18,574 --> 00:02:20,160
No Asher!

60
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:22,388
The Worm is my thing.

61
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,776
♪ Vincemas! ♪

62
00:02:24,787 --> 00:02:27,312
- Vincemas, Vincemas...
- Vincemas. Vincemas.

63
00:02:27,322 --> 00:02:28,447
- ♪ Vincemas ♪
- Whoop!

64
00:02:28,457 --> 00:02:30,516
Okay, so while we're camping,

65
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,184
I need you to run a tight ship.

66
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:34,253
And this year, I made you a check list.

67
00:02:34,263 --> 00:02:35,421
You're welcome.

68
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:38,023
Listen, do not worry about a thing.

69
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,693
You just go have fun
on your camping trip.

70
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:42,628
Nothing's more important
than straight white men

71
00:02:42,638 --> 00:02:45,731
taking a break from a world
stacked against them.

72
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:47,820
Vince, I don't know if we should go.

73
00:02:48,172 --> 00:02:49,630
What? No.

74
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,109
- You... you have to go.
- Yeah.

75
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,963
You're too poor for any
other kind of vacation.

76
00:02:52,974 --> 00:02:55,945
I know, but I'm getting the sense that
Michael might not want to do this.

77
00:02:55,956 --> 00:02:58,377
I saw him Googling "gay-friendly
circuses to run away with."

78
00:02:58,388 --> 00:02:59,580
This trip's important...

79
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:02,245
And he's gonna love it once he
hears the ghost story I'ma tell.

80
00:03:02,256 --> 00:03:05,737
- It could straight up be a "Grimm."
- It could straight up be a "Grimm."

81
00:03:05,748 --> 00:03:06,799
Yeah, I don't know.

82
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,116
Listen, maybe Michael
would be more excited

83
00:03:10,127 --> 00:03:12,153
if... if he...
if he could bring a friend.

84
00:03:12,163 --> 00:03:13,487
- Bring a friend.
- Yeah.

85
00:03:13,497 --> 00:03:15,495
- Wait...
- That's a great idea.

86
00:03:15,506 --> 00:03:17,393
- Yes!
- Friends make everything better!

87
00:03:17,412 --> 00:03:19,725
Uh... Yeah!

88
00:03:19,736 --> 00:03:21,795
I'm supposed to bond with
Michael on this trip

89
00:03:21,806 --> 00:03:24,599
but if bringing a friend helps
him enjoy it, that could work.

90
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:27,201
Makes my s'mores distribution
kind of a nightmare,

91
00:03:27,211 --> 00:03:28,703
but, uh...

92
00:03:28,713 --> 00:03:30,671
I guess that's parenting, huh?

93
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,971
Guys, I hate to break it to you, but

94
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:36,677
I just don't know
if I'm the camping type.

95
00:03:36,687 --> 00:03:38,479
You know, with my size and skin tone,

96
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:40,718
it would be very easy for
a wolf to make me its Mowgli.

97
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:42,374
Well, wait till you hear this cool idea.

98
00:03:42,385 --> 00:03:43,751
What if you brought a friend along?

99
00:03:43,761 --> 00:03:45,745
Just tell him you wanna
pitch a tent together.

100
00:03:45,756 --> 00:03:46,760
Wait...

101
00:03:46,771 --> 00:03:48,589
No. I... I can't bring a friend.

102
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,877
How would I pick just one?

103
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,148
You know......
I don't need to be someone's...

104
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,361
"13th Reason Why."

105
00:03:53,371 --> 00:03:55,096
Oh, come on! They'll get over it.

106
00:03:55,106 --> 00:03:57,164
With four, you can play chicken or...

107
00:03:57,174 --> 00:03:59,300
- Br-br-bridge!
- Please.

108
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,936
Please, I'm not gonna pick a friend.

109
00:04:01,946 --> 00:04:03,270
Fine. Screw it.

110
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,672
Bring all of 'em.

111
00:04:04,682 --> 00:04:06,374
Okay, look.

112
00:04:06,384 --> 00:04:08,676
I can't bring a friend

113
00:04:08,686 --> 00:04:11,312
because I don't really have any.

114
00:04:11,322 --> 00:04:13,014
Wait, but you just said...

115
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:20,633
What do you mean you
don't have any friends?

116
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:23,503
What about Roger or Mimi or Angel?

117
00:04:23,521 --> 00:04:25,500
Those are all from "Rent."

118
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:27,175
I do talk about them a lot, I guess.

119
00:04:27,186 --> 00:04:28,712
How could you not have any friends?

120
00:04:28,714 --> 00:04:30,514
You're cool; you have incredible style;

121
00:04:30,516 --> 00:04:32,182
you say all your opinions
in a rude voice.

122
00:04:32,184 --> 00:04:34,010
- Yeah.
- Look, I don't know, okay?

123
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,645
I just... growing up in Ohio,

124
00:04:35,655 --> 00:04:37,480
I didn't get along with the other kids.

125
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,315
I didn't do sports, like the jocks,

126
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:41,550
- or opioids, like the farm kids.
- Yeah.

127
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,754
And I guess I just got
used to entertaining myself.

128
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:46,381
Well, guess what?

129
00:04:46,392 --> 00:04:47,873
You are in luck,

130
00:04:47,884 --> 00:04:49,709
because if there's
one thing I can teach you,

131
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,612
it's how to become popular
in high school.

132
00:04:51,623 --> 00:04:53,490
You were popular in high school?

133
00:04:53,508 --> 00:04:55,367
Oh, like the way Carrie was prom queen?

134
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,186
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Vince was the real deal.

135
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:01,115
He was voted most likely to peak
in high school, and he did.

136
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:02,651
One of my many peaks.

137
00:05:02,662 --> 00:05:04,045
I'm a mountain range.

138
00:05:04,056 --> 00:05:06,303
Anyway, this is just another
skill I can pass on to you.

139
00:05:06,314 --> 00:05:08,498
Wow, okay. Lay it on me.

140
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:12,211
I am the Elphaba to your Glinda.

141
00:05:12,778 --> 00:05:14,740
- The Luke to your Yoda?
- Nerd.

142
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:17,611
Okay, the way to become
popular in high school is...

143
00:05:17,622 --> 00:05:19,213
Be yourself. That worked for me.

144
00:05:19,224 --> 00:05:22,115
Yeah, but yourself is
ridiculously handsome and athletic.

145
00:05:22,126 --> 00:05:23,850
I'm only ridiculously handsome.

146
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:26,592
Well, my freshman year, I was shorter
than you, covered in pimples.

147
00:05:26,603 --> 00:05:28,818
Had to use prescription
deodorant so strong,

148
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,740
coroners use it on dead bodies.

149
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,990
So, like you, I needed to find a way in.

150
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,479
And at our school, the cool kids

151
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,537
were the senior varsity
baseball players.

152
00:05:37,548 --> 00:05:39,303
So that's when you started
playing baseball?

153
00:05:39,314 --> 00:05:40,373
No.

154
00:05:40,384 --> 00:05:42,744
That's when I started
stealing dip from the store

155
00:05:42,755 --> 00:05:44,647
and giving it to the baseball players.

156
00:05:44,657 --> 00:05:47,170
Sometimes, they even let me chew it...

157
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:49,108
- after they chewed it.
- That's disgusting.

158
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:51,745
Look, the point is,
if you wanna be popular,

159
00:05:51,756 --> 00:05:54,255
you gotta find the cool kids
and do the work.

160
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:57,381
Yes, I got Hepatitis B
from chewing spit-out dip,

161
00:05:57,392 --> 00:05:59,850
but I also got Hepatitis F,

162
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:01,147
friendship,

163
00:06:01,158 --> 00:06:03,250
and that is incurable.

164
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:18,147
Yeah, right.

165
00:06:18,157 --> 00:06:20,483
Nice sweater.

166
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:24,731
Hey, what's up?

167
00:06:24,742 --> 00:06:26,600
Do you guys mind if I sit with you?

168
00:06:26,611 --> 00:06:28,334
I'm sorry. "Guys"?

169
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:31,295
So we're just assigning genders
willy-nilly now, are we?

170
00:06:31,306 --> 00:06:33,756
Some people at this table
are trans, okay?

171
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:35,859
Not me. I identify as a guy.

172
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,995
But you didn't know that.

173
00:06:37,006 --> 00:06:39,969
O... okay. I'm s... I'm sorry.

174
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:42,138
I didn't... okay.

175
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:46,108
Hey, can I sit with you?

176
00:06:46,118 --> 00:06:47,936
I'm really quiet,
unless you're talking about

177
00:06:47,947 --> 00:06:50,679
- something I have an opinion on.
- We're the Indian students club:

178
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:51,826
"Indian Students in School."

179
00:06:51,837 --> 00:06:53,662
- I'm Arjun.
- "ISIS"?

180
00:06:53,673 --> 00:06:55,076
We pronounce it "Izz-izz."

181
00:06:55,087 --> 00:06:56,733
I was gonna invite you
to join us earlier,

182
00:06:56,744 --> 00:06:59,021
but because of your coloring,
we really weren't sure

183
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:00,990
if you were Indian or something else.

184
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,217
Oh, well, you're in luck.

185
00:07:02,228 --> 00:07:04,709
I'm Indian. Well, half-Indian.

186
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,928
Ooh, exotic! What's the other half?

187
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:10,199
I hope it's not Brazilian.
We can't compete with that.

188
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:11,936
Look at those guys.

189
00:07:11,947 --> 00:07:14,143
Nope, half-Indian,
half-boring old white guy.

190
00:07:14,154 --> 00:07:16,222
Well then, pull up, have a chair.

191
00:07:18,751 --> 00:07:20,976
I got three kegs of Horny Nun IPA.

192
00:07:20,986 --> 00:07:23,112
Mmm... sorry, we're a gym.

193
00:07:23,122 --> 00:07:25,748
- Why would we order beer?
- Just keep pedaling.

194
00:07:25,758 --> 00:07:27,750
I will sign for those.

195
00:07:27,761 --> 00:07:29,485
Ruby, why do you need
all those beer kegs?

196
00:07:29,495 --> 00:07:32,888
We've been through this.
Beer does not hydrate you.

197
00:07:32,898 --> 00:07:36,025
Um... I actually ordered those

198
00:07:36,035 --> 00:07:38,894
for a new Donkey Kong workout.

199
00:07:38,904 --> 00:07:41,030
Yeah, these are the barrels
you jump over.

200
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,925
Hm. Sounds plausible.

201
00:07:42,936 --> 00:07:44,595
And fun.

202
00:07:44,844 --> 00:07:46,535
But where's the giant hammer?

203
00:07:46,545 --> 00:07:48,671
Okay, okay! I was lying.

204
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:50,339
Is somebody gonna sign for these?

205
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:52,541
The truth is, we have a cathartic

206
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:55,344
and slightly mean-spirited
party called Vincemas

207
00:07:55,354 --> 00:07:56,948
every year when you go camping.

208
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,350
Vincemas?

209
00:07:58,361 --> 00:08:00,915
Is that like "Vince <i>mas"</i> in Spanish?

210
00:08:00,926 --> 00:08:02,745
'Cause that sounds like
you want more Vince.

211
00:08:02,756 --> 00:08:04,519
No, like Christmas,

212
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,769
when we get to have fun
without our demanding boss.

213
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,199
Wait, what?

214
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:11,227
Look, I know Vince can be
a demanding boss,

215
00:08:11,237 --> 00:08:12,695
but is it really that bad?

216
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:14,644
He signed that birthday card
we passed around.

217
00:08:14,655 --> 00:08:16,497
He signed it, "Get back to work."

218
00:08:16,508 --> 00:08:19,468
Vincemas is basically
our version of a shore leave.

219
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:22,171
We blow off steam, get drunk,

220
00:08:22,181 --> 00:08:24,440
- and maybe spend the night in the tank.
- I'm gonna go.

221
00:08:24,451 --> 00:08:26,464
I gotta pick my girlfriend's
kid up from the lisp doctor.

222
00:08:26,475 --> 00:08:29,778
Oh, no-no-no, come on... Dude, come on.

223
00:08:29,788 --> 00:08:31,280
Fine, sign for the beers.

224
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,922
Thank you! I owe you one.

225
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:35,883
Hey, okay, but promise you're gonna
make fun of me as well as Vince.

226
00:08:35,894 --> 00:08:37,953
My face is too symmetrical.
Maybe start with that.

227
00:08:37,963 --> 00:08:39,492
Okay.

228
00:08:39,503 --> 00:08:41,547
Ah, yeah!

229
00:08:42,034 --> 00:08:44,125
Vince! Vince!

230
00:08:44,136 --> 00:08:45,304
Your advice worked.

231
00:08:45,315 --> 00:08:47,729
I have successfully made friends!

232
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,964
- Oh, nice!
- Nice!

233
00:08:48,974 --> 00:08:50,567
I knew my old tricks would still work.

234
00:08:50,578 --> 00:08:52,501
Next, I'm gonna teach you
the guitar chords

235
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:54,734
♪ for "Stairway" ♪

236
00:08:55,023 --> 00:08:56,195
So, who are these kids?

237
00:08:56,206 --> 00:08:58,734
Actually, they're all in
the Indian students club.

238
00:08:58,745 --> 00:09:00,503
- All right!
- Oh, nice.

239
00:09:00,537 --> 00:09:01,867
All right.

240
00:09:01,878 --> 00:09:05,047
So that's... that's like
a cultural club or something?

241
00:09:05,057 --> 00:09:07,351
I'm only asking because,
you know, back in my day,

242
00:09:07,362 --> 00:09:09,195
cool kids were athletes, burn-outs,

243
00:09:09,206 --> 00:09:11,211
this one kid who kept
getting struck by lightning.

244
00:09:11,222 --> 00:09:13,703
Oh, um, well, I'm not sure if
they're cool, but they're nice.

245
00:09:13,714 --> 00:09:16,525
And for the first time in my life,
I'm learning about Indian culture.

246
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:18,375
Did you know Nepal is a real place?

247
00:09:18,386 --> 00:09:21,297
It's India's attic, where
they store the Dalai Lama.

248
00:09:21,308 --> 00:09:24,067
I think it's so important
you're learning who you are.

249
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:26,402
It will be nice for
an actual Indian musician

250
00:09:26,412 --> 00:09:28,170
to appropriate our culture for once.

251
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,405
- Hmm.
- Yeah... yeah!

252
00:09:29,415 --> 00:09:31,607
I... I agree... I agree, but...

253
00:09:31,617 --> 00:09:33,208
you don't wanna limit yourself, okay?

254
00:09:33,218 --> 00:09:35,744
You wanna play the field.
Indian kids, right?

255
00:09:35,754 --> 00:09:38,562
- Then breakfast club, swim team.
- Swim team?

256
00:09:38,573 --> 00:09:42,351
Oh, I can't wear goggles. It's
impossible to give side-eye.

257
00:09:42,362 --> 00:09:45,921
But if you really think
I should keep looking,

258
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:47,922
- I guess I can.
- Yeah, I just want you to have

259
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:50,750
the same crazy high school
experience that I did, you know?

260
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:53,495
Minus the child out of wedlock.
No offense.

261
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,008
Hey.

262
00:09:59,026 --> 00:10:00,398
Don't you want to sit with us?

263
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:02,237
Oh, sorry, we just met.

264
00:10:02,247 --> 00:10:03,773
I didn't wanna seem too thirsty.

265
00:10:03,784 --> 00:10:06,175
Yesterday, you
bought us all chewing tobacco.

266
00:10:06,185 --> 00:10:08,544
Yeah, look, sorry about that.

267
00:10:08,554 --> 00:10:09,719
It was stupid.

268
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,947
My dad just really wants me
to be popular like he was,

269
00:10:11,957 --> 00:10:14,883
and I thought I should try
to sit with the cool kids,

270
00:10:14,893 --> 00:10:17,886
not... just the Indian kids.

271
00:10:17,896 --> 00:10:20,117
- Um...
- Oh, wow.

272
00:10:20,128 --> 00:10:21,990
That's not stupid at all.

273
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:23,359
Dude, that's racist.

274
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,726
No, to be fair, I think
he's more ignorant than racist.

275
00:10:25,737 --> 00:10:27,859
He thinks Ramadan is a hotel chain.

276
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,263
I think it's sad that
you're being encouraged

277
00:10:30,274 --> 00:10:32,390
to deny half of who you are.

278
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:34,469
I've never thought about it like that.

279
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,773
But you're right.

280
00:10:35,784 --> 00:10:38,101
My house is whiter than
a Williams Sonoma.

281
00:10:38,112 --> 00:10:40,797
If I wanna hang out with Indian
kids, they're like, "Oh, no!"

282
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:42,594
But if I wanna eat
unseasoned turkey burgers,

283
00:10:42,605 --> 00:10:44,101
they're like, "Thumbs up."

284
00:10:44,112 --> 00:10:46,234
The whitest things you can do
with your hands."

285
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,984
Yeah, next thing they'll
probably wanna take you camping.

286
00:10:48,995 --> 00:10:51,289
Oh, my God.

287
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,525
I cannot even!

288
00:10:55,276 --> 00:10:56,992
Tell me you booked the
site from last year.

289
00:10:57,003 --> 00:10:58,094
Dude, you know it!

290
00:10:58,105 --> 00:10:59,398
How good is this turkey burger?

291
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,179
Dude!

292
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:04,101
- Mmm.
- Hey, what's the matter?

293
00:11:04,112 --> 00:11:05,562
Do you not like your turkey burger?

294
00:11:05,573 --> 00:11:06,731
Is it too spicy?

295
00:11:06,742 --> 00:11:08,308
I knew I shouldn't have used salt.

296
00:11:09,314 --> 00:11:11,828
Remember those Indian kids
you forbade me to befriend?

297
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,929
Well, they opened my eyes up
to the whitewashing

298
00:11:13,947 --> 00:11:15,374
that's happening in my own home.

299
00:11:15,385 --> 00:11:17,952
You're both culturally insensitive.

300
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,104
Okay, we've gotta get a big banner

301
00:11:36,115 --> 00:11:37,514
with Vince's face on it.

302
00:11:37,525 --> 00:11:39,061
Hey, guys, you're never gonna believe

303
00:11:39,063 --> 00:11:40,973
what Michael accused me of last night.

304
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:43,122
Wearing the same jeans for
too long between washes?

305
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:44,233
We've all noticed.

306
00:11:44,235 --> 00:11:46,627
He said I was culturally insensitive.

307
00:11:46,637 --> 00:11:47,929
That's crazy, right?

308
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:49,764
Well...

309
00:11:49,774 --> 00:11:51,567
Well, you did spend my
entire first week here

310
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,567
trying to figure out
if I was Muslim or not.

311
00:11:53,577 --> 00:11:55,002
No, I didn't. What? No.

312
00:11:55,012 --> 00:11:56,771
I wanted to know
why you didn't eat bacon.

313
00:11:56,781 --> 00:11:58,306
You know, I love Muslims.

314
00:11:58,316 --> 00:12:00,041
It's the vegetarians I don't trust.

315
00:12:00,051 --> 00:12:02,877
Look, truth be told, when I
wanted to take Columbus Day off

316
00:12:02,887 --> 00:12:04,612
to celebrate my Italian roots,

317
00:12:04,622 --> 00:12:06,514
you... you laughed right in my face.

318
00:12:06,524 --> 00:12:09,695
Come on, in New York,
Italian's not an ethnicity.

319
00:12:09,706 --> 00:12:11,686
It's, like, normal.

320
00:12:11,696 --> 00:12:13,220
You just called Italian normal,

321
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,723
like everyone else isn't normal.

322
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:17,124
Am I not normal, Vince?

323
00:12:17,134 --> 00:12:19,093
Okay, no-no-no, for... for one thing,

324
00:12:19,103 --> 00:12:21,128
it's a whole different system
for hot girls.

325
00:12:21,138 --> 00:12:22,930
- Whoa. Man.
- That's not really...

326
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,899
Okay, look, guys,
I just wanted him to have

327
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:27,435
the best time possible
in high school, like I did.

328
00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:29,270
Now he's really upset, so...

329
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,072
maybe I should just
cancel the camping trip.

330
00:12:31,082 --> 00:12:32,473
Whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa, cancel...

331
00:12:32,483 --> 00:12:33,741
What? What? What?

332
00:12:33,751 --> 00:12:34,875
- Cancel the trip?
- Yeah.

333
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:37,359
No one's calling you a racist.

334
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,413
They're just saying
you're being insensitive,

335
00:12:39,423 --> 00:12:41,749
like a... like a patriotic grandparent.

336
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:43,918
I mean, we dated.
Would a racist person date me?

337
00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:45,686
Or Michael's mother, Priya?

338
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:47,355
You're not racist; you're a fetishist.

339
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:48,622
- Exactly.
- Perfect.

340
00:12:48,632 --> 00:12:49,906
- What?
- Shabaz, do you have

341
00:12:49,917 --> 00:12:51,414
anything encouraging to say?

342
00:12:51,425 --> 00:12:53,656
- Not really.
- I just... think you do.

343
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:55,629
- Come on.
- Look.

344
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:57,732
All white guys are
a little bit insensitive.

345
00:12:57,742 --> 00:12:59,266
But it's not your fault.

346
00:12:59,276 --> 00:13:02,603
You've been brainwashed
by the white-run media.

347
00:13:02,613 --> 00:13:04,071
And it's not just them.

348
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:07,042
It's the government;
it's school systems.

349
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:09,312
In some ways,

350
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:12,482
you're the real victim.

351
00:13:12,493 --> 00:13:14,320
You get it, Shabaz.

352
00:13:14,331 --> 00:13:17,266
Actually, I think it would be
culturally insensitive

353
00:13:17,277 --> 00:13:18,486
- if you didn't go.
- Yeah.

354
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:21,389
Cool! Well then,
uh, camping trip back on.

355
00:13:23,434 --> 00:13:24,992
- Thank you.
- All right, bye!

356
00:13:25,002 --> 00:13:27,128
Don't come back until
you've texted us first.

357
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,132
- Okay, all right.
- All right, disco ball...

358
00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:33,540
All right, grab Michael,
then let's hit the road.

359
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:36,217
I don't wanna get stuck with the
campsite next to the outhouse again.

360
00:13:36,228 --> 00:13:37,304
Right.

361
00:13:37,314 --> 00:13:39,954
Hey, I bet those are Michael's new
friends that think I'm a creep.

362
00:13:39,965 --> 00:13:42,209
I want to clear my name. I'm a good guy.

363
00:13:42,219 --> 00:13:43,228
I gotta go talk to 'em.

364
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,271
Or you could stay here
because they don't like you.

365
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,382
Uh... I'll be right back.

366
00:13:50,011 --> 00:13:54,038
What's up, guys? I'm Michael's dad,
and I just want to clear the air.

367
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:55,507
I think it's super cool that.

368
00:13:55,518 --> 00:13:57,257
Michael's hanging out with you guys.

369
00:13:57,268 --> 00:13:59,260
I just don't want him to miss out on

370
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,595
a more diverse group of friends
like I had in high school.

371
00:14:01,606 --> 00:14:03,898
Sorry, we're not diverse?

372
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,765
Yeah, but, you know,

373
00:14:05,776 --> 00:14:07,802
Indian people do pretty good in society,

374
00:14:07,812 --> 00:14:09,904
so it's almost like
you're not a minority,

375
00:14:09,914 --> 00:14:12,220
you know, 'cause so many
of you are so rich.

376
00:14:12,231 --> 00:14:14,541
So, because our parents do well,

377
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:16,853
it's like we're practically white?

378
00:14:16,864 --> 00:14:19,213
So sorry, that...
that came out wrong, okay?

379
00:14:19,223 --> 00:14:22,850
Trust me, I'm super woke.
Here's what's up.

380
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,219
A lot of your parents are
doctors and stuff, right?

381
00:14:25,229 --> 00:14:27,629
And when you think of minorities,
you think, like, poor.

382
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,907
Okay, this conversation
is becoming a hate crime.

383
00:14:29,918 --> 00:14:32,649
For what it's worth, I think
Indian women are beautiful.

384
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,428
"Top Chef" lady, "Quantico,"

385
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:36,263
Princess Jasmine... hottest cartoon.

386
00:14:36,273 --> 00:14:38,299
- Uh, hey. What's up, buddy?
- You need to leave.

387
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:40,678
This is the most offensive
thing to happen at this school

388
00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:42,834
since our homecoming queen
was a straight blonde girl.

389
00:14:42,845 --> 00:14:45,532
Okay, well, let's go. Car's packed
and ready for the camping trip.

390
00:14:45,543 --> 00:14:47,384
I'm not going on
your stupid camping trip.

391
00:14:47,395 --> 00:14:49,944
The Indian Students in School
are having a party tonight.

392
00:14:49,954 --> 00:14:52,880
I'm going to that. Let's go, guys.

393
00:14:56,327 --> 00:14:58,961
I can't believe you ruined the only
cool tradition our family had.

394
00:14:58,972 --> 00:15:01,021
Dad must be swirling in his urn!

395
00:15:01,031 --> 00:15:02,456
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

396
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:04,425
I don't think I could
possibly feel any worse.

397
00:15:04,435 --> 00:15:06,834
I'm gonna go put this stuff in the gym.

398
00:15:07,771 --> 00:15:08,929
Vincemas.

399
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:11,065
Uh, wait! Don't go in the gym!

400
00:15:11,075 --> 00:15:14,401
And finally,
let's give a toast for Vince

401
00:15:14,411 --> 00:15:16,737
for not being here
and shutting this down, like,

402
00:15:16,747 --> 00:15:18,239
"Everyone get back to work.

403
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:21,342
Fun is illegal. Heil Hitler."

404
00:15:30,018 --> 00:15:31,297
Vincemas!

405
00:15:31,308 --> 00:15:33,383
You guys are celebrating
the fact that I'm not here?

406
00:15:33,394 --> 00:15:36,250
No-no-no, it's like,
um... like "Vince <i>mas."</i>

407
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:38,813
It's Spanish for "more Vince,"

408
00:15:38,824 --> 00:15:40,605
which is what we got.

409
00:15:40,616 --> 00:15:42,683
- Our wish came true.
- Oh, Dana?

410
00:15:42,694 --> 00:15:44,386
Thank God. Someone with some sense.

411
00:15:44,397 --> 00:15:46,144
Probably about to
shut all this down, right?

412
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:47,846
I was, Vince. I swear to God I was.

413
00:15:47,857 --> 00:15:49,957
And... and then,
I got onboard to be cool.

414
00:15:49,968 --> 00:15:52,427
- Sure.
- I am so disappointed.

415
00:15:52,437 --> 00:15:53,962
To treat your boss this way?

416
00:15:53,972 --> 00:15:56,565
On Vincemas?

417
00:15:56,575 --> 00:15:58,308
Shame.

418
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,911
Michael, you came.

419
00:16:09,921 --> 00:16:11,849
No whites allowed. I love it.

420
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,649
We're just glad you ditched that
cracker fest at home to join us.

421
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:17,152
Why are you all so dressed up?

422
00:16:17,162 --> 00:16:18,987
Is it the Bollywood Oscars?

423
00:16:18,997 --> 00:16:20,322
Or Gandhi's birthday?

424
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:21,865
I know so little about Indian culture.

425
00:16:21,876 --> 00:16:25,849
Don't worry. Tonight, we're doing the
most time-honored Indian tradition:

426
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,216
exploring trendy nightclubs
in Downtown Manhattan!

427
00:16:29,227 --> 00:16:31,372
With our parents' Amexes!

428
00:16:31,383 --> 00:16:33,768
Oh! Clubbing.

429
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:35,294
Oh, that's... that's great.

430
00:16:35,305 --> 00:16:37,138
Tonight, DJ Tanner is spinning,

431
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:39,307
so we are going to cut it up.

432
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:41,209
Oh! Well... well, I'm
not dressed for that.

433
00:16:41,219 --> 00:16:43,615
This outfit is Jim Belushi for Kmart.

434
00:16:43,626 --> 00:16:45,224
Oh, that's okay. We got gel for days.

435
00:16:45,235 --> 00:16:47,552
Plus, you can borrow my
baby bro's True Religion jeans.

436
00:16:47,563 --> 00:16:48,943
They're mad flared.

437
00:16:52,697 --> 00:16:53,855
Streamers and banners?

438
00:16:53,865 --> 00:16:55,323
This is a waste of money...

439
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:58,868
not to mention the impact
on the environment.

440
00:17:01,273 --> 00:17:03,514
Is this a piñata of my head?

441
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:05,200
Okay, this is not fair.

442
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,561
I'm not some no-fun,
taskmaster boss, right?

443
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:08,600
No!

444
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:09,870
- Thank you.
- No.

445
00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:12,476
It's not... it's not
that you are those things.

446
00:17:12,487 --> 00:17:15,046
It's that you act like them
and are perceived as them.

447
00:17:15,057 --> 00:17:17,212
Okay, no, I'm a fun boss, all right?

448
00:17:17,222 --> 00:17:19,548
I put a bowl of Jolly Ranchers
by the front desk!

449
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:20,628
That's fun!

450
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,843
The Jolly Ranchers are great.
All right? They're great!

451
00:17:22,854 --> 00:17:24,553
But we have no parties, no costumes.

452
00:17:24,563 --> 00:17:26,792
You wouldn't even let me wear
a Hawaiian shirt to work.

453
00:17:26,803 --> 00:17:30,025
That's because I don't want
people to think this is a Trader Joe's.

454
00:17:30,035 --> 00:17:32,268
See? That's no fun!

455
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,531
Look, all I'm saying is that

456
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:39,229
the people that work here
think of Champions as a family,

457
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,564
even if you don't.

458
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,509
And one of the things families do

459
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,844
is make fun of Dad.

460
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:45,514
Are you the mom in this scenario?

461
00:17:45,525 --> 00:17:46,753
Yes.

462
00:17:46,764 --> 00:17:49,991
Maybe just consider being
a little bit more laidback.

463
00:17:50,422 --> 00:17:53,014
I was gonna tell you that
over a campfire, but...

464
00:17:53,024 --> 00:17:54,716
guess that's not gonna happen. Nope.

465
00:17:54,726 --> 00:17:58,553
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna
treat myself to a Horny Nun.

466
00:18:02,617 --> 00:18:05,210
Oh, my God, dude.

467
00:18:05,537 --> 00:18:07,429
Yes! What do you think?

468
00:18:07,439 --> 00:18:08,897
I love it.

469
00:18:08,907 --> 00:18:10,437
Just one more thing.

470
00:18:12,043 --> 00:18:15,937
All right, the limo is outside,
and Steve Aoki is pumping.

471
00:18:15,947 --> 00:18:18,237
Let's do a shot and head out.

472
00:18:18,248 --> 00:18:19,729
Here you go.

473
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,276
Oh, and I got tonight all covered.

474
00:18:21,286 --> 00:18:23,144
Just Venmo me 500 bucks. Cool?

475
00:18:23,154 --> 00:18:25,814
Yeah... yeah, no, so cool.
Definitely cool.

476
00:18:25,824 --> 00:18:27,449
I'm just gonna run upstairs

477
00:18:27,459 --> 00:18:29,417
to the bathroom
and re-gel before we head out.

478
00:18:29,427 --> 00:18:31,753
Ah, good idea.
I was gonna say something.

479
00:18:31,763 --> 00:18:33,054
Just use the whole container.

480
00:18:35,433 --> 00:18:38,793
This isn't as fun with Vince
in his office hating us.

481
00:18:38,803 --> 00:18:40,589
Okay, okay.

482
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,465
To prove that I am
a chill, laid-back boss,

483
00:18:43,475 --> 00:18:46,167
I'm going to let you have
your stupid Vincemas.

484
00:18:46,177 --> 00:18:48,222
Really? Wow.

485
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:50,972
And I...

486
00:18:50,982 --> 00:18:53,141
am going to give you guys......

487
00:18:53,151 --> 00:18:55,810
60 bucks for pizza.

488
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,550
Aww.

489
00:18:57,561 --> 00:18:59,019
Vince, man,

490
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,015
I'm really, really sorry.

491
00:19:01,026 --> 00:19:03,484
- Thank you.
- But pizza's, like, 200 bucks

492
00:19:03,495 --> 00:19:05,086
if we're gonna get premium toppings.

493
00:19:05,096 --> 00:19:07,989
Oh, my God, you gotta
be kidding me. Okay, okay. Fine.

494
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:10,589
But have fun,
get it out of your systems,

495
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,594
because next year,
I'm coming to Vincemas,

496
00:19:13,605 --> 00:19:15,997
and no one will enjoy that.

497
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:17,632
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

498
00:19:17,642 --> 00:19:19,000
All right.

499
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,936
- Vincemas!
- Vincemas!

500
00:19:20,946 --> 00:19:23,004
- Vincey-Vincey-Vince...
- Vincemas!

501
00:19:26,318 --> 00:19:29,444
Hey, why aren't you at
the Indian cultural party?

502
00:19:29,454 --> 00:19:31,479
It turns out it wasn't
an Indian party after all.

503
00:19:31,489 --> 00:19:33,982
It was just a cover
to get drunk and go clubbing.

504
00:19:33,992 --> 00:19:36,573
Wait, uh... these kids sound cool.

505
00:19:36,584 --> 00:19:38,642
Yeah. Yeah, no, they are.

506
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,522
And I wasn't okay with that.

507
00:19:40,532 --> 00:19:43,495
- I'm sorry you have a lame son.
- Oh, you're lame?

508
00:19:43,506 --> 00:19:44,651
Let me ask you a question:

509
00:19:44,662 --> 00:19:47,329
Did they create a holiday
to celebrate your lameness?

510
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:49,898
Hmm, so I'm guessing
you heard about Vincemas.

511
00:19:49,908 --> 00:19:52,033
Damn it! Everyone knew?

512
00:19:52,043 --> 00:19:54,202
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay, well...

513
00:19:54,212 --> 00:19:56,308
then I guess you also know

514
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:58,540
I am not the one to talk to
about making friends,

515
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,175
because apparently,

516
00:20:00,185 --> 00:20:02,877
I'm not an expert on the subject.

517
00:20:02,887 --> 00:20:04,479
You know, for what it's worth,

518
00:20:04,489 --> 00:20:06,548
I don't think you're
culturally insensitive.

519
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:08,383
Though it was nice
to hang out with some kids

520
00:20:08,393 --> 00:20:09,737
who could teach me about myself.

521
00:20:09,748 --> 00:20:11,219
Until today, I thought the Taj Mahal

522
00:20:11,229 --> 00:20:13,822
- was a fancy shopping mall.
- Right.

523
00:20:13,832 --> 00:20:15,367
No, it's a casino.

524
00:20:15,378 --> 00:20:17,826
And I'm sorry I didn't want you
hanging out with those kids.

525
00:20:17,836 --> 00:20:19,260
You know, I was just so busy

526
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,162
trying to bond with you
over things I like,

527
00:20:21,172 --> 00:20:22,911
I didn't think about
what you might like.

528
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:26,434
I mean, even though I don't
love the idea of camping

529
00:20:26,444 --> 00:20:30,405
and you don't love the idea
of learning about anything,

530
00:20:30,415 --> 00:20:33,408
maybe we could create a new
family tradition together?

531
00:20:33,418 --> 00:20:35,710
All right, yeah. Cool.

532
00:20:37,622 --> 00:20:40,849
What about: father-son laser tag?

533
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:42,951
I only use lasers for hair removal.

534
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:44,853
Okay, fine.

535
00:20:44,863 --> 00:20:46,221
You got any ideas?

536
00:20:46,231 --> 00:20:48,189
All right, Michael, welcome to...

537
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:49,858
The First Annual Cook-Patel.

538
00:20:49,868 --> 00:20:53,361
Family Camp Bollywood
Movie Night and Dinner!

539
00:20:53,371 --> 00:20:55,764
Be sure to check out the s'morsas.

540
00:20:55,774 --> 00:20:58,254
The potato works really well
with the marshmallow.

541
00:20:58,265 --> 00:20:59,305
Texturally.

542
00:20:59,316 --> 00:21:00,702
Taste-wise, it's bad.

543
00:21:00,712 --> 00:21:02,070
- Yeah.
- I love it.

544
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,772
Yeah, camping is more fun
than I thought.

545
00:21:03,782 --> 00:21:06,441
Maybe next year, we could do it
at a Four Seasons?

546
00:21:06,451 --> 00:21:08,443
Mm, maybe next year,
you could like baseball.

547
00:21:08,453 --> 00:21:11,031
No, definitely not.

548
00:21:11,828 --> 00:21:15,063
