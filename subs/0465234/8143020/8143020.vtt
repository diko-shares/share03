51
00:05:00.638 --> 00:05:04.683
The Knights of the Golden Circle
was a Southern extremist group,

operating in the north
to subvert Union forces.

72
00:06:08.956 --> 00:06:13.168
Booth didn't seek out Thomas Gates
regarding the treasure map that night.

73
00:06:13.961 --> 00:06:16.005
It was Thomas who called the meeting.

74
00:06:16.088 --> 00:06:19.008

the assassination of Lincoln.

75

78
00:06:27.016 --> 00:06:31.020
...one of the missing pages from the
infamous diary of John Wilkes Booth

79
00:06:31.103 --> 00:06:35.816
with the name Thomas Gates written on
a list along with all the other killers.

80
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.406
- And Latin?
- Booth was a student of Latin.

81
00:06:42.489 --> 00:06:45.659
He shouted, <i>"Sic semper tyrannis"</i>
after he shot Lincoln.

82
00:06:45.743 --> 00:06:49.288
- "Thus always to..."
- "Thus always to tyrants." We know.

83
00:06:49.997 --> 00:06:53.959
- "Surratt, <i>copiae</i>"?
- Military supplies.

84
00:06:54.043 --> 00:06:56.378
Mary Surratt was convicted and hanged

85
00:06:56.462 --> 00:06:59.340
for supplying Booth with
a rifle and field glasses.

86
00:07:03.218 --> 00:07:07.389
- "Thomas Gates, <i>artifex."</i>
- "Designer"

87
00:07:07.473 --> 00:07:10.851
- or "mastermind."
- I know what it means.

88
00:07:12.478 --> 00:07:15.147
He must have,
uh, planned the assassination.

89
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.233

- Could mean mastermind of anything.

My grandfather
told me this story himself.

98
00:07:43.926 --> 00:07:47.346
- I saw the truth of it in his eyes.
- I'm sorry, sir. I truly am.

Patrick, to authenticate it.

Oh, wow. Is this a book
about the Templar treasure?

107
00:08:46.989 --> 00:08:51.493
Yes, it is about the Templar treasure,
but it's also about other things.

what happened with you and Abigail?

"So?"

Yeah, like,
"So, I guess my opinion doesn't matter."

00:12:24.706 --> 00:12:28.126
- Connor, good to see you again.
- Gates.

169
00:12:28.877 --> 00:12:30.420
How did you get in, Ben?

170
00:12:33.674 --> 00:12:36.051
Riley! Come out here!

171
00:12:38.512 --> 00:12:40.097
What? (LAUGHS)

172
00:12:42.015 --> 00:12:46.311
Hey! What are you doing here?
I mean, it's your house, but...

173
00:12:46.395 --> 00:12:49.398
I sent you a copy of my book.
Did you get a chance...?

174
00:12:49.481 --> 00:12:52.526
- No, I haven't read it yet.
- Mm.

175
00:12:52.985 --> 00:12:55.570
I know you.
You're the White House curator.

176
00:12:55.654 --> 00:13:00.242
- I'm Riley. We met, uh, back in...
- Right. You're, uh, Ben's assistant.

177
00:13:00.534 --> 00:13:01.952
What?

178
00:13:02.035 --> 00:13:04.621
Um, maybe I should go.

179
00:13:04.705 --> 00:13:08.333
- Yeah, I'm really...
- Dinner tomorrow night?

180
00:13:09.001 --> 00:13:11.628
I... I actually already
have plans for tomorrow.

181
00:13:11.712 --> 00:13:12.963
You do?

182
00:13:14.172 --> 00:13:16.883
- Of course you do.
- But I'm free on Friday.

183
00:13:16.967 --> 00:13:20.095
- Awkward.
- Oh, great. (LAUGHS)

184
00:13:21.638 --> 00:13:23.265
- Good night.
- Good night.

185
00:13:24.182 --> 00:13:26.518
I cannot believe you broke in.

186
00:13:26.601 --> 00:13:29.229
- What did you take?
- It's just my things.

187
00:13:30.772 --> 00:13:31.982
Hand it over, Ben.

188
00:13:32.065 --> 00:13:34.609
(SIGHS) I need to see
the Booth diary page.

189
00:13:34.693 --> 00:13:38.488
You saw the page yourself.
There is no treasure map on it.

190
00:13:38.572 --> 00:13:42.367
No, it's a cipher leading to a map.
Anyone spectral-image the page?

191
00:13:42.451 --> 00:13:45.704
No need to. The ink writing
on the page is clearly visible.

192
00:13:45.787 --> 00:13:47.998
It could have been erased or faded.

193
00:13:48.081 --> 00:13:51.543
You're the director of document
conservation. You know this.

194
00:13:51.626 --> 00:13:53.587
Not up to me.
It's not my department.

195
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:56.214
That department reports
to your department.

196
00:13:56.298 --> 00:13:58.550
Come on. One look under infrared.

197
00:13:58.633 --> 00:14:00.635
You can have the Boston Tea Tables.

198
00:14:06.475 --> 00:14:07.768
Both of them?

200

RILEY: We've been looking
at this page for hours.

201
00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:15.525
There's nothing there.

202
00:14:16.359 --> 00:14:20.781
Ben, I really don't think we're
going to find anything on this page.

203
00:14:20.864 --> 00:14:23.283
In a hundred years,
no one's going to remember

204
00:14:23.366 --> 00:14:26.661
anyone involved in the Lincoln
assassination besides Booth.

205
00:14:26.745 --> 00:14:30.916
That's not true. Do you know
the expression, "His name is mud"?

206
00:14:30.999 --> 00:14:33.001
- Yes. Of course.
- You do?

207
00:14:33.085 --> 00:14:38.006
- You know the origin of the expression?
- Does anyone but you?

208
00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:41.760
Dr Samuel Mudd was convicted
of being a co-conspirator

209
00:14:41.843 --> 00:14:45.472
in the Lincoln assassination.
The evidence was circumstantial.

210
00:14:45.555 --> 00:14:48.350
He was later pardoned,
but it didn't matter.

211
00:14:48.433 --> 00:14:53.188
Mudd's name still lives in infamy. And I
will not let Thomas Gates' name be mud.

212
00:14:55.607 --> 00:14:57.317
- ABIGAIL: Ben.
- What?

213
00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.777
Look at this.

214
00:15:00.028 --> 00:15:02.572
- See that?
- Oh.

215
00:15:02.656 --> 00:15:07.410
- That's quite something, isn't it?
- Yeah. It says "smudge."

216
00:15:08.286 --> 00:15:09.621
It's nothing.

217
00:15:12.499 --> 00:15:15.377
Residual ink
from the facing page. Flip it.

218
00:15:16.044 --> 00:15:17.838
The letters are backwards.

219
00:15:17.921 --> 00:15:19.923
- It's a cipher.
- Yes. It is.

220
00:15:20.006 --> 00:15:22.300
A cipher.
See how the letters are coupled?

221
00:15:22.384 --> 00:15:28.140
Playfair ciphers encode letters
in pairs. This could prove his story.

222
00:15:28.223 --> 00:15:32.602
Unless you decode the cipher,
this does not prove a theory.

223
00:15:32.686 --> 00:15:34.896
That's OK.
We need a five-letter keyword.

224
00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.274
- What's the keyword?
- I don't know yet.

225

Dr Nichols from announcing
the discovery of the page tomorrow.

231
00:15:56.042 --> 00:16:00.839
No, now, wait. Can't you ask him to
wait until I prove Thomas is innocent?

232
00:16:02.215 --> 00:16:03.884
What if he isn't innocent?

You heard the story from Grandpa.

The story? This guy's got evidence.
He's got everything.

We have a story. We have nothing.

For one brief moment,
the Gates family could hold its head up.

- Now we're a bunch of crazies.
- But we're not liars.

264
00:17:54.661 --> 00:17:56.746
Wilkinson is saying that Thomas Gates

265
00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:01.376
was a mastermind to one of
the darkest hours in U.S. history.

266
00:18:01.459 --> 00:18:04.045
And he burned the diary page
to cover that up.

267
00:18:04.838 --> 00:18:07.215
You and I both know he burned the page

268
00:18:07.299 --> 00:18:09.801
to keep Booth's men
from finding the treasure.

269
00:18:09.884 --> 00:18:11.636
That's what we're going to prove.

270
00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.222
- Only one way to prove it.
- Find the treasure.

271

You've got to find it. You're
going to help me find it. So come on.

"Treasure map."

- Got all that. Anything after that?

something he did? Anything at all?

- Wait a minute.
- What?

277
00:18:38.872 --> 00:18:40.999
He took his son's hand.

278
00:18:41.082 --> 00:18:45.170
He looked him in the eye, and he said,
with his dying breath,

- "The debt that all men pay."
- "The debt that all men pay"?

- Fascinated by it.

Civil War, especially.
My family's descended from

336
00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:34.255
Confederate General Albert Pike.
He was a remarkable man.

337
00:21:34.339 --> 00:21:38.510
But, then again, what is history but
a marker for the deeds of great men?

A man only has one lifetime,
but history can remember you forever.

which Statue of Liberty?

OK. Let me try this out.

496
00:31:39.026 --> 00:31:42.154
Abigail, would you like
to come with me, please?

497
00:31:42.238 --> 00:31:43.989
Yes. Thank you.

498
00:31:44.073 --> 00:31:45.699
Ridiculous. You're staying.

499
00:31:45.783 --> 00:31:47.701
- It's too dangerous.
- I am so coming.

500
00:31:47.785 --> 00:31:50.329
- Door number two.
- Door two, coming up.

501

(BUZZING)

502
00:31:51.497 --> 00:31:53.374
- You're not coming.
- Call security.

503
00:31:53.958 --> 00:31:56.961
RILEY: <i>You should be near
a service elevator.</i>

504
00:31:57.044 --> 00:31:59.213
What are you doing?
Are those for the queen?

505
00:31:59.296 --> 00:32:03.300
Queen's not here. There's
no flag flying. Queen's at Windsor.

506
00:32:03.384 --> 00:32:05.928
- What are you doing?
- See the desk, without you.

507
00:32:07.221 --> 00:32:08.597
- No.
- Don't let her go.

508
00:32:08.681 --> 00:32:10.099
- Abigail...
- (CLICKING)

509
00:32:11.225 --> 00:32:13.227
All right. Get in. Get in. Get in!

510
00:32:14.895 --> 00:32:16.147
Hold this.

511
00:32:22.319 --> 00:32:24.613
Will you give me
the flowers back, please?

512
00:32:24.697 --> 00:32:25.739
Yeah.

513
00:32:31.829 --> 00:32:35.541
- What?
- Wearing the perfume I bought you.

514
00:32:36.417 --> 00:32:37.418
So?

515
00:32:38.043 --> 00:32:40.254
So I think it smells kind of pretty.

516
00:32:41.088 --> 00:32:44.258
- It's the flowers, Ben.
- No, it's not.

517
00:32:47.511 --> 00:32:48.971
Let's go.

518
00:32:53.934 --> 00:32:55.603
RILEY: <i>OK, now turn left.</i>

519
00:32:56.478 --> 00:32:59.231
- Dead end.
- RILEY: <i>I mean right. Go right.</i>

520
00:33:05.279 --> 00:33:08.616
- The flowers... petals... stamens.
- Good. Good.

521
00:33:16.624 --> 00:33:17.958
Go, go.

522
00:33:20.961 --> 00:33:22.338
BEN: That's it.

523
00:33:24.298 --> 00:33:25.966
ABIGAIL: The Resolute desk.

524
00:33:27.051 --> 00:33:28.427
We're looking for...

525
00:33:29.511 --> 00:33:34.308
...writing, patterns in the carvings.
Could be anything.

526
00:33:37.811 --> 00:33:39.188
Hey, look at this.

527
00:33:42.191 --> 00:33:47.404
- "Malcolm Gilvary, 1880."
- Hold on one second.

528
00:33:48.155 --> 00:33:52.618
Here we go. Malcolm Gilvary.
He didn't make furniture.

529
00:33:52.701 --> 00:33:55.829
<i>He made Chinese puzzle boxes.</i>

530
00:34:03.712 --> 00:34:05.256
- Oh...
- What?

531
00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:10.928
I think these drawers
work like tumblers in a safe.

532
00:34:11.011 --> 00:34:14.515
OK, four drawers...
Four-digit combination?

533
00:34:15.474 --> 00:34:16.558
What about a year?

534
00:34:16.642 --> 00:34:21.355
Uh, let me see.
Queen Victoria, born 1819.

535
00:34:21.438 --> 00:34:23.274
So you go one...

536
00:34:26.193 --> 00:34:27.194
Eight.

537
00:34:32.241 --> 00:34:33.284
One.

538
00:34:37.413 --> 00:34:38.497
Nine.

539
00:34:40.332 --> 00:34:44.003
- Any luck?
- OK... 1876 was on the inscription

540
00:34:44.086 --> 00:34:46.422
<i>on the statue in Paris. Let's try that.</i>

541
00:34:46.964 --> 00:34:47.965
One.

542
00:34:50.301 --> 00:34:51.552
Eight.

543
00:34:54.096 --> 00:34:55.848
Seven.

544
00:35:00.602 --> 00:35:01.937

New rules.

547
00:35:32.343 --> 00:35:35.596
These markings, like Incan or Aztec.

548
00:35:35.679 --> 00:35:37.890
I have never seen any symbols like this.

549
00:35:37.973 --> 00:35:43.354
I mean, this looks centuries older
than Civil War.

550
00:35:43.437 --> 00:35:44.813
What do you think it means?

551
00:35:44.897 --> 00:35:48.400
I doubt it has anything to do
with the plot to assassinate Lincoln.

What is that?

576
00:37:38.385 --> 00:37:41.096
Went to Buckingham Palace,
all I got was this wood?

577
00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.849
Look at the symbols.
Never seen anything like this.

578
00:37:44.391 --> 00:37:46.143

- Hey, Patrick.

Nice to see you two together again.

- Yeah, well, we're not.
- Yeah.

629
00:43:18.517 --> 00:43:21.978
Oh, I was hoping to get some
of these boxes out of the house.

630
00:43:31.071 --> 00:43:35.158
I can't read the whole thing,
but I can tell you that

631
00:43:35.242 --> 00:43:38.703
these are definitely pre-colonial
Native American markings.

632
00:43:38.787 --> 00:43:42.207
- Easily 500 years old.
- Easily.

633
00:43:46.127 --> 00:43:48.964
I can identify one symbol.

634
00:43:49.506 --> 00:43:52.092
Look at this.
Do you know what that is?

635
00:43:52.175 --> 00:43:54.135
Sacred calendrical? I don't know.

636
00:43:54.594 --> 00:43:57.180
That symbol is Cíbola.

637
00:43:57.973 --> 00:43:59.099
That's Cíbola.

638
00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.519
The City of Gold.

639
00:44:03.103 --> 00:44:04.396
The City of Gold.

640
00:44:07.357 --> 00:44:11.361
BEN: "In 1527, a Spanish ship
wrecked on the Florida coast.

641
00:44:11.444 --> 00:44:13.321
There were only four survivors.

642
00:44:13.405 --> 00:44:18.368
One was a slave named Esteban
who saved a local tribe's dying chief.

643
00:44:18.451 --> 00:44:21.288
As a reward,
he was taken to their sacred city,

644
00:44:21.371 --> 00:44:23.290
a city built from solid gold.

645
00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:29.296
Later, when Esteban tried to find
the city again, he never could.

646
00:44:29.379 --> 00:44:35.010
But the legend grew, and every explorer
came to the New World in search of it.

647
00:44:35.969 --> 00:44:39.890
When General Custer's search for gold
ended with his last stand

648
00:44:39.973 --> 00:44:44.436
at Little Bighorn, it became clear
none would ever find it."

649
00:44:50.066 --> 00:44:54.821
Ben, can you imagine if the Confederates
got their hands on the City of Gold...

650
00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:56.990
My God.

651
00:44:57.949 --> 00:44:59.534
I'm going to go talk to her.

652
00:45:03.413 --> 00:45:05.790
- You're coming with me.
- No!

653
00:45:05.874 --> 00:45:10.128
- Hey. No one else can translate it.
- There are others.

654
00:45:10.211 --> 00:45:11.588
There are several others.

655
00:45:11.671 --> 00:45:13.965
For ancient Native American?
No one better.

656
00:45:14.049 --> 00:45:17.052
- Who?
- Look, Ben, I can't go with you.

657
00:45:17.135 --> 00:45:20.347
- It's been, what? Twenty-five years.
- Thirty-two.

658
00:45:22.015 --> 00:45:23.224
That long?

659
00:45:23.975 --> 00:45:27.646
There's a reason
why we haven't spoken in 32 years.

660
00:45:27.729 --> 00:45:30.440
- We have nothing in common.
- Me?

661
00:45:31.107 --> 00:45:34.945
Yes, of course. And I'm sure
she's just as proud of you as I am.

662
00:45:35.028 --> 00:45:37.405
- Who?
- His mom.

663
00:45:40.367 --> 00:45:44.496
- Will you relax? It's gonna be fine.
- Sure. Should look at the bright side.

664
00:45:44.579 --> 00:45:48.375
Been a long time. Maybe she
lost her memory, won't recognise me.

665
00:45:49.209 --> 00:45:50.585
I hate her!

666
00:45:52.587 --> 00:45:54.130
We're in the right place.

667
00:45:57.258 --> 00:46:00.428
I'm gonna take myself
out of the line of fire for this one.

668
00:46:00.512 --> 00:46:02.305
BEN: Hi, Mom.
WOMAN: Benjamin!

669
00:46:02.389 --> 00:46:05.558
Abigail! What a surprise!
Hello, sweetheart.

670
00:46:05.642 --> 00:46:06.643
Hi.

671
00:46:07.894 --> 00:46:08.895
Oh.

672
00:46:10.563 --> 00:46:14.067
You see? One syllable,
a knife in the heart.

673
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:15.986
- Oh, no.
- She can do that.

674
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:18.947
I can also track the whereabouts
of my toothbrush.

675
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:21.992
I was not the one that left
the toothbrushes in Marrakech.

676
00:46:22.075 --> 00:46:25.036
I stowed them both
in the travel case, as instructed.

677
00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:29.249
Yes, and you also insisted
on loading the luggage into the taxi.

678
00:46:29.332 --> 00:46:32.419
- Didn't insist. I loaded the luggage.
- Not the travel case.

679
00:46:32.502 --> 00:46:35.672
Travel case is not luggage.
The case goes into the luggage.

680
00:46:35.755 --> 00:46:39.134
- Who was in charge of packing?
- I couldn't get the case into

681
00:46:39.217 --> 00:46:42.262
the luggage. It was full
with that stupid rug you bought.

682
00:46:42.345 --> 00:46:44.431
You thought it had secret stitching.

683
00:46:44.514 --> 00:46:46.933
- How stupid was that?
- Did have stitching.

684
00:46:47.017 --> 00:46:50.395
- Six phoney green leather suitcases...
- Mom.

685
00:46:52.689 --> 00:46:54.691
I need you to take a look at this.

686
00:46:55.859 --> 00:46:58.361
- What is that a picture of?
- It's interesting.

687
00:46:58.445 --> 00:47:00.947
- We think it might be Olmec.
- It is.

688
00:47:02.282 --> 00:47:04.784
Yes, yes, definitely proto-Zoquean.

689
00:47:04.868 --> 00:47:08.038
We were hoping
that you could translate it.

690
00:47:08.788 --> 00:47:10.373
Yes, of course you were.

691
00:47:13.209 --> 00:47:16.546
Oh, this doesn't involve
another treasure hunt, does it?

692
00:47:16.629 --> 00:47:19.424
Mom, this is actually very important.

693
00:47:21.384 --> 00:47:23.803
All right. What have we got here?

694
00:47:24.554 --> 00:47:29.267
This... this glyph here,
that means "bird." And that means...

695
00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:36.316
Uh, "noble bird."

696
00:47:36.399 --> 00:47:39.569
"Find the noble bird,
let him take you by the hand

697
00:47:39.652 --> 00:47:42.947
and give you passage
to the sacred temple."

698
00:47:45.825 --> 00:47:47.952
(LAUGHS)

699
00:47:49.662 --> 00:47:52.832
Oh, you think this is a treasure map
for Cíbola, don't you?

700
00:47:53.333 --> 00:47:55.210
Well, that is exactly what it is.

701
00:47:55.293 --> 00:47:59.422
No, this glyph doesn't mean "Cíbola."
It means "the centre of the world."

702
00:47:59.506 --> 00:48:03.343
You know, you used to like it. She
fell in love with me on a treasure hunt.

703
00:48:03.426 --> 00:48:07.138
That was not love. That was
excitement, adrenaline and tequila.

704
00:48:07.222 --> 00:48:09.072
- BEN: Mom...
- I was trying to get course credit.

705
00:48:09.099 --> 00:48:12.602
Treasure hunting paid off,
in case you haven't read the papers.

706
00:48:12.685 --> 00:48:14.854
Had nothing to do with you.
That was Ben.

707
00:48:14.938 --> 00:48:17.232
Ben found the treasure.
You did nothing.

708
00:48:17.315 --> 00:48:22.195
Patrick, Emily, please. Can we
just figure out what's on the page?

709
00:48:24.864 --> 00:48:26.533
Well, that's it, I'm afraid.

710
00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:31.412
These glyphs are only partials.
So you only have half a treasure map.

711
00:48:32.539 --> 00:48:33.832
I'm sorry.

712
00:48:34.624 --> 00:48:36.084
Not that I'm surprised.

713
00:48:38.169 --> 00:48:40.672
BEN: At least we know
where the rest of the map is.

714
00:48:41.297 --> 00:48:42.632
What?

715
00:48:43.133 --> 00:48:45.468
You know where it is?
Why didn't you tell me?

716
00:48:45.552 --> 00:48:48.221
Obviously you have
a tendency to overreact!

717
00:48:51.891 --> 00:48:54.769
- I'm sorry.
- So am I.

718
00:48:54.853 --> 00:48:56.312
So where is it?

719
00:48:56.396 --> 00:49:00.984
Inscription on the statue in Paris said,
"These twins stand resolute."

720
00:49:01.067 --> 00:49:04.612
We think the map's divided
between the two Resolute desks.

721
00:49:04.696 --> 00:49:08.199
The Resolute desk.
The Resolute desk?

722
00:49:08.283 --> 00:49:10.201
President's desk?

723
00:49:10.827 --> 00:49:12.579
The president. What president?

724
00:49:12.662 --> 00:49:15.582
- Our president?
- Unfortunately, yes.

725
00:49:15.665 --> 00:49:17.167
But that means...

726
00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:18.585
Wait, so we have to...

727
00:49:19.919 --> 00:49:21.087
The White House?

728
00:49:22.422 --> 00:49:25.925
The Oval Office... to be exact.

729
00:49:28.553 --> 00:49:30.346
Why would I overreact to that?

730
00:49:35.018 --> 00:49:38.855
- That's not what I signed on for.
- Could we focus on the issue at hand?

731
00:49:40.982 --> 00:49:41.983
Thank you.

732
00:49:45.945 --> 00:49:47.906
NICHOLS: It's early, pre-Columbian.

733
00:49:47.989 --> 00:49:50.241
- Can you translate it?
- Are you kidding?

734
00:49:50.325 --> 00:49:53.620
This is an extinct,
exceedingly rare language.

735
00:49:53.703 --> 00:49:56.497
Only a handful of people
study these languages.

736
00:49:56.581 --> 00:49:57.957
Where are we to find them?

737
00:49:58.666 --> 00:50:02.045
Universities, I suppose.
But you don't have the whole thing.

738
00:50:02.128 --> 00:50:03.129
What do you mean?

739
00:50:03.838 --> 00:50:07.383
These glyphs here... they're out off.

740
00:50:07.467 --> 00:50:10.553
There's more to the map?
How are we going to find that?

741
00:50:10.637 --> 00:50:13.598
We won't have to.
Gates will get it somehow.

742
00:50:13.932 --> 00:50:18.311
The Resolute desk is near
the south wall in the Oval Office.

743
00:50:18.394 --> 00:50:20.605
Look at this. Look.

744
00:50:20.688 --> 00:50:22.523
Small door on the front of the desk.

745
00:50:22.607 --> 00:50:26.069
PATRICK: FDR had that put in so
guests couldn't see his wheelchair.

746
00:50:26.152 --> 00:50:29.030
- But...
- Guys, take a look at this.

747
00:50:30.865 --> 00:50:32.283
ABIGAIL: This could work.

748
00:50:32.367 --> 00:50:36.120
I believe it's time for you to make
a date with your new boyfriend.

749
00:50:37.497 --> 00:50:38.665
I think you're right.

750
00:50:40.625 --> 00:50:45.171
MAN: <i>We hope you're enjoying
the White House Easter Egg Roll.</i>

751
00:50:45.255 --> 00:50:49.342
<i>Face painting continues at 2:00
near the south fountain.</i>

752
00:50:50.843 --> 00:50:54.389
- BEN: That Connor in the bunny suit?
- Thank you.

753
00:50:54.472 --> 00:50:57.600
I've never been to an Easter Egg Roll.
It's kind of sweet.

754
00:50:57.684 --> 00:50:59.310
Yeah, I love it.

755
00:51:00.853 --> 00:51:05.066
I know you. Your great-great-grandfather
killed President Lincoln.

756
00:51:05.149 --> 00:51:07.485
No. That would be John Wilkes Booth.

757
00:51:07.568 --> 00:51:09.737
Eisenschiml says that Booth was a tool

758
00:51:09.821 --> 00:51:13.241
in a greater conspiracy
that involved men in Lincoln's Cabinet.

759
00:51:13.324 --> 00:51:15.660
Absurd.
Eisenschiml's book is filled with

760
00:51:15.743 --> 00:51:18.705
- spotty research and false assumptions.
- Oh, yeah?

761
00:51:18.788 --> 00:51:21.916
Explain why Lincoln's bodyguard
left his post that night?

762
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.378
Because President Lincoln
was never accompanied by guards

763
00:51:25.461 --> 00:51:28.965
when attending the theatre. Listening?
Especially on Good Friday.

764
00:51:29.048 --> 00:51:32.010
Explain why all the bridges
out of Washington were closed

765
00:51:32.093 --> 00:51:35.263
except one,
the one Booth needed to escape?

766
00:51:35.346 --> 00:51:38.308
OK, run along now,
you impossible child. Run along.

767
00:51:39.934 --> 00:51:42.478
What is going on
with the education in America?

768
00:51:42.562 --> 00:51:45.523
- Hey! Hey!
- Connor!

769
00:51:45.606 --> 00:51:48.067
- I'm so glad you decided to come...
- Hey.

770
00:51:48.151 --> 00:51:50.695
- ...with Gates.
- Connor.

771
00:51:50.778 --> 00:51:52.864
- We just ran into each other.
- Oh.

772
00:51:56.826 --> 00:51:58.411
Aren't you going to ask him?

773
00:51:58.494 --> 00:51:59.996
- Ask me what?
- Nothing.

774
00:52:00.079 --> 00:52:03.207
- No, really. What?
- I really wouldn't want to impose.

775
00:52:03.708 --> 00:52:08.379
Well, what she means is
she doesn't think you can.

776
00:52:08.463 --> 00:52:11.591
- Doesn't think I can what?
- She wants to see the Oval Office.

777
00:52:11.674 --> 00:52:15.553
- No. That is way too much to ask.
- No, it's, uh...

778
00:52:17.472 --> 00:52:18.723
- I can do that.
- Really?

779
00:52:18.806 --> 00:52:19.807
You see?

780
00:52:20.433 --> 00:52:21.768
- You can?
- Yeah.

781
00:52:21.851 --> 00:52:26.147
That is so cool, Connor. I have
always wanted to see the Oval Office.

782
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:27.899
Connor rocks.

783
00:52:28.566 --> 00:52:31.569
Well... here we are.

784
00:52:31.652 --> 00:52:34.030
- Mm.
- Wow.

785
00:52:34.447 --> 00:52:38.701
Empire furnishings
and crenelated moulding. Love it.

786
00:52:38.785 --> 00:52:40.620
Hm.

787
00:52:40.703 --> 00:52:43.581
Amazing feeling, isn't it,
standing in here?

788
00:52:43.664 --> 00:52:46.667
- Yes. Amazing, huh?
- Oh, could...

789
00:52:46.751 --> 00:52:47.877
Oh. Sorry.

790
00:52:50.505 --> 00:52:54.133
Oh, that's, uh... The Resolute desk.

791
00:52:54.801 --> 00:52:57.887
Might recognise it from
the photo of young JFK Junior

792
00:52:57.970 --> 00:53:00.515
playing underneath
while his father was working.

793
00:53:00.598 --> 00:53:02.475
- Wonderful.
- Yeah.

794
00:53:02.558 --> 00:53:05.436
But many people don't know

795
00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:08.981
that this desk has a twin
that sits in Buckingham Palace.

796
00:53:09.065 --> 00:53:11.067
- Isn't that something?
- Who knew?

797
00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:13.403
Every president since
Rutherford B. Hayes

798
00:53:13.486 --> 00:53:16.447
has used that desk,
except, uh, Johnson and Nixon.

799
00:53:16.531 --> 00:53:17.990
And Ford, of course.

800
00:53:18.116 --> 00:53:20.535
- Uh, no.
- Uh, yes.

801
00:53:20.618 --> 00:53:22.620
- No.
- Yes.

802
00:53:22.703 --> 00:53:25.456
Abigail! Did you lose an earring?

803
00:53:26.332 --> 00:53:29.127
Oh! I... I did, yes.

804
00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:32.463
Connor, these were given to me
by my grandmother.

805
00:53:32.547 --> 00:53:36.342
I suppose we should look for it.
Wouldn't want anyone finding an earring

806
00:53:36.426 --> 00:53:39.345
that doesn't belong
to the first lady in the Oval Office.

807
00:53:39.429 --> 00:53:40.763
- Yes.
- Excellent point,

808
00:53:40.847 --> 00:53:43.141
considering we're not
supposed to be here.

809
00:53:43.224 --> 00:53:46.436
- Yeah.
- Why don't we, um, go over here

810
00:53:46.519 --> 00:53:47.854
and check it out?

811
00:53:49.647 --> 00:53:51.566
I'll check over here.

812
00:54:00.533 --> 00:54:03.119
- Do you think it fell down here?
- Yes.

813
00:54:09.709 --> 00:54:13.171
- Maybe here.
- Probably.

814
00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:22.889
Oh, no.

815
00:54:28.227 --> 00:54:32.064
- You did sit on the sofa.
- Oh, the bunnies.

816
00:54:37.445 --> 00:54:39.113
Connor!

817
00:54:39.197 --> 00:54:43.367
- You found it.
- I did.

818
00:54:53.252 --> 00:54:55.254
Thank you so much!

819
00:54:55.713 --> 00:54:57.173
Uh...

820
00:54:58.007 --> 00:55:00.801
You're just the best. Mm.

821
00:55:04.847 --> 00:55:05.932
Mm!

822
00:55:11.521 --> 00:55:12.855
Mm!

823
00:55:13.648 --> 00:55:14.941
Mm!

824
00:55:16.192 --> 00:55:18.486
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- (MOANING)

825
00:55:19.612 --> 00:55:20.780
(PANTING) Thank you.

826
00:55:23.991 --> 00:55:24.992
OK.

827
00:55:27.578 --> 00:55:29.830
BEN: Empty.
ABIGAIL: Someone must've taken it.

828
00:55:29.914 --> 00:55:33.501
Brightest men in our country sat
at that desk for over a hundred years.

829
00:55:33.584 --> 00:55:35.711
- Look.
- Course one of 'em found the map.

830
00:55:35.795 --> 00:55:39.257
- A symbol stamped into the wood.
- The presidential seal.

831
00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:41.217
It's not the presidential seal.

832
00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:44.971
The eagle's holding a scroll
instead of olive branches.

833
00:55:45.054 --> 00:55:47.932
BEN: I'm not sure what this is.
PATRICK: What do we do?

834
00:55:48.015 --> 00:55:49.642
Did none of you read my book?

835
00:55:51.519 --> 00:55:53.813
The eagle clutching the scroll.

836
00:55:54.146 --> 00:55:55.940
- Do you know what it means?
- Yeah.

837
00:55:56.023 --> 00:55:58.150
But it's not something I could tell you.

838
00:55:59.235 --> 00:56:03.155
It's something that
I have to show you... in my book.

839
00:56:09.495 --> 00:56:13.040
- You didn't even open it?
- I was moving.

840
00:56:13.249 --> 00:56:14.834
Chapter 13.

841
00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:23.884
- "The President's Secret Book"?
- "The President's Secret Book."

842
00:56:23.968 --> 00:56:28.097
It happens to be a collection
of documents for presidents

843
00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:31.601
by presidents,
and for presidents' eyes only.

844
00:56:32.018 --> 00:56:35.396
And I'm not just talking about
JFK here, guys.

845
00:56:35.479 --> 00:56:39.900
The 18 and a half missing minutes
of the Watergate tapes.

846
00:56:40.610 --> 00:56:44.697
Did the Apollo really land
on the moon? Did it? Did it?

847
00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:48.743
And the coup de grâce... Area 51.

848
00:56:48.826 --> 00:56:51.954
Come on, Riley. That's...
that's an urban legend.

849
00:56:52.038 --> 00:56:54.957
Is it, Abigail? Is it?

850
00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.168
It's just totally...

851
00:56:57.251 --> 00:56:58.461
- Crazy?
- Yeah.

852
00:56:58.544 --> 00:57:03.341
Hm. 'Cause last time I checked,
we pretty much make our living on crazy.

853
00:57:03.424 --> 00:57:06.594
- He's got a point.
- I guess so.

854
00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:09.221
Same symbol.

855
00:57:09.305 --> 00:57:12.683
Released in '66 under
the Freedom of Information Act.

856
00:57:12.767 --> 00:57:14.477
The eagle and the scroll,

857
00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:18.814
the secret symbol
in the President's Book.

858
00:57:18.898 --> 00:57:21.692
So you're saying that
whatever was on that plank

859
00:57:21.776 --> 00:57:24.695
is now in the President's Secret Book?

860
00:57:26.989 --> 00:57:28.407
RILEY: Ben.

861
00:57:29.075 --> 00:57:31.160
If it was you trying to convince me...

862
00:57:32.078 --> 00:57:35.665
...you'd have less evidence,
and I'd already believe you by now.

863
00:57:40.378 --> 00:57:42.088
The eagle with the scroll?

864
00:57:44.465 --> 00:57:46.842
Conspiracy theorists like to believe

865
00:57:46.926 --> 00:57:49.804
that it's the symbol
for the President's Secret Book.

866
00:57:49.887 --> 00:57:51.472
You bought Riley's book.

867
00:57:51.555 --> 00:57:54.934
(LAUGHS) Your friend writes a book
about government conspiracies.

868
00:57:55.017 --> 00:57:57.478
- You don't think we know about it?
- But is it true?

869
00:57:57.561 --> 00:57:59.939
Does the president have a secret book?

870
00:58:06.904 --> 00:58:08.155
Do you like ducks?

871
00:58:09.615 --> 00:58:11.242
(QUACKING)

872
00:58:11.617 --> 00:58:12.827
There is a book.

873
00:58:14.370 --> 00:58:16.163
Why are you telling me out here?

874
00:58:17.331 --> 00:58:19.792
Because inside, I'm a federal agent.

875
00:58:19.875 --> 00:58:22.128
Out here,
I'm talking to you as a friend.

876
00:58:22.211 --> 00:58:26.590
- Where's the President's Book kept?
- Only the current president knows.

877
00:58:26.674 --> 00:58:29.260
The book is passed
from president to president,

878
00:58:29.343 --> 00:58:31.595
and each one chooses
his own hiding place.

879
00:58:31.679 --> 00:58:33.723
You're the FBI.
Can't you get it for me?

880
00:58:33.806 --> 00:58:37.351
Only way you'll ever see that book
is if you get elected president.

881
00:58:38.394 --> 00:58:39.812
Well, you never know.

882
00:58:41.647 --> 00:58:43.899
All I need is a few minutes with him.

883
00:58:44.775 --> 00:58:46.569
A few minutes? Really?

884
00:58:46.652 --> 00:58:48.863
Even if you were married
to the president,

885
00:58:48.946 --> 00:58:51.198
you wouldn't be able
to get a few minutes.

886
00:58:51.282 --> 00:58:54.243
Not when he's surrounded by handlers.
If I get him alone...

887
00:58:54.326 --> 00:58:56.620
How do you expect
to get the president alone?

888
00:58:56.704 --> 00:58:59.832
Before the Civil War,
the states were all separate.

889
00:59:00.166 --> 00:59:03.669
People used to say,
"The United States are."

890
00:59:04.253 --> 00:59:09.049
Wasn't until the war ended people
started saying, "The United States is."

891
00:59:10.885 --> 00:59:15.431
Under Lincoln... we became one nation.

892
00:59:15.514 --> 00:59:17.683
And Lincoln paid for it with his life.

893
00:59:17.767 --> 00:59:20.269
- So did Thomas Gates.
- Right.

894
00:59:21.395 --> 00:59:22.688
With his life.

895
00:59:24.148 --> 00:59:28.152
So how am I gonna get him alone?

896
00:59:31.864 --> 00:59:33.115
I'm gonna kidnap him.

897
00:59:34.742 --> 00:59:37.745
I'm gonna kidnap
the president of the United States.

898

(LAUGHS)

899
00:59:41.415 --> 00:59:43.501
- That's not funny.
- I'm your father.

900
00:59:43.584 --> 00:59:46.796
How do you expect me to respond?
I can't let you ruin your life.

901
00:59:46.879 --> 00:59:48.881
Are you out of your mind?

902
00:59:48.964 --> 00:59:52.009
Read my book, and you'd know
you can't get to that book.

903
00:59:52.092 --> 00:59:54.512
Exactly how do you plan on doing this?

904
00:59:55.846 --> 00:59:58.724
- I was thinking Mount Vernon.
- Oh.

905
00:59:58.808 --> 01:00:01.060
- What?
- I'm in.

906
01:00:01.143 --> 01:00:04.063
{\an8}MAN: Sir, we have to move the party.

907
01:00:04.146 --> 01:00:06.941
Some historian claims
the Spencer Landmark Hotel

908
01:00:07.024 --> 01:00:09.485
was used for Klan meetings
in the late 1800s.

909
01:00:09.568 --> 01:00:13.030
- Anyone know if this is true?
- I've got the <i>Washington Gazette.</i>

910
01:00:13.113 --> 01:00:17.201
They want a quote on, "Is the president
being insensitive to minority issues?"

911
01:00:17.284 --> 01:00:20.412
- Doesn't matter.
- Get a list of approved alternates.

912
01:00:20.496 --> 01:00:23.165
- What do you have?
- Yeah, I know it's short notice.

913
01:00:23.249 --> 01:00:26.919
The pipe burst in the hotel
that we previously booked.

914
01:00:27.002 --> 01:00:32.007
- I... There is water everywhere.
- A retirement party for 200 people.

915
01:00:32.091 --> 01:00:34.844
- Gunston Hall.
- Monticello is booked.

916
01:00:34.927 --> 01:00:37.179
So is Gunston Hall and Tudor Place.

917
01:00:37.263 --> 01:00:40.641
The Denby Hotel is available,
and so is Mount Vernon.

918
01:00:40.724 --> 01:00:44.854
- Oh, wow. You are a lifesaver.
- The Denby is great.

919
01:00:44.937 --> 01:00:48.148
Strike that. The Denby was booked.
Mount Vernon's all we got.

920
01:00:48.232 --> 01:00:50.442
Book it before someone else does.

921
01:00:51.944 --> 01:00:55.030
(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)

922
01:00:55.114 --> 01:00:57.700
And let me say
what an honour it is to be here

923
01:00:57.783 --> 01:01:00.077
and add my happy birthday to you,

I'm allowed to fish in public water?

Mr President,
that is exactly what it is.

- Architectural history major, Yale.
- I did not know that.

960

- (LAUGHS)

- Only one way to find out, sir.
- Maybe we should take a look.

969
01:04:10.684 --> 01:04:12.227
Are we allowed to do that?

970
01:04:12.603 --> 01:04:15.981

Tom, alert the vice president.

1004
01:06:35.078 --> 01:06:37.664
Mr President, sometime between 1880,

1005
01:06:37.748 --> 01:06:40.834
when the Resolute desk
was placed in the Oval Office,

1006
01:06:40.918 --> 01:06:45.380
and now, one of our presidents found
a secret compartment in the desk.

1007
01:06:45.464 --> 01:06:49.218
Hidden inside was a plank
with Native American writing on it.

1008
01:06:49.301 --> 01:06:54.056
A treasure map to Cíbola,
the legendary City of Gold, sir.

1009
01:06:54.139 --> 01:06:56.475
All this just to ask me
about a treasure map?

1010
01:06:56.558 --> 01:06:59.895
That map is a key to proving
Thomas Gates' innocence.

1011
01:06:59.978 --> 01:07:04.233
I know for a fact that the plank
is no longer in the Resolute desk.

1012
01:07:04.316 --> 01:07:05.859
You've been in my desk too?

1013
01:07:05.943 --> 01:07:08.987
I believe the whereabouts
of that plank is now hidden...

1014
01:07:09.821 --> 01:07:11.865
...in the President's Book, sir.

1015
01:07:14.826 --> 01:07:16.870
The book known only to our presidents.

1016
01:07:17.996 --> 01:07:20.499
It contains all of our nation's secrets.

how to get out of here

you're willing to go to prison,

1029

Everything I am
is because of my ancestors, sir.

1032
01:08:11.883 --> 01:08:14.636
Thomas Gates gave his
last full measure of devotion

1033
01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:17.306
to his country to stop the KGC.

1034

I believe they should be honoured.

"Will you agree to let me see it?"

1040

Even if something like that
really did exist,

1041
01:08:43.081 --> 01:08:45.959
why do you think I would
actually just give it to you?

1042
01:08:46.585 --> 01:08:48.420
Because it will probably lead us

1043
01:08:48.503 --> 01:08:52.591

Native American treasure of all time.

of the United States, sir.

01:19:04.118 --> 01:19:05.244
It's clear. Let's go!

than I thought.

feel about being kidnapped?

He wants the translation.

I know I'm the last person
you want to see,

but we need you to translate something.

- Yes, of course.

Oh. Uh...

Yes. "Islands...
Islands of stone in a sea of grass."

1220
01:22:19.355 --> 01:22:23.985
That's what the Lakota used to call
the Black Hills in South Dakota.

1221
01:22:24.694 --> 01:22:25.695
Right.

1222
01:22:28.948 --> 01:22:33.369
"Find where the moon touches the earth
and release the hummingbird."

1223
01:22:37.915 --> 01:22:39.000
That's it?

1224
01:22:46.591 --> 01:22:50.928
Did it ever occur to you...?
I can't believe I'm saying this.

1225
01:22:52.138 --> 01:22:56.100
Did it ever occur to you that I did
the things I did to impress you?

1226
01:22:58.853 --> 01:23:02.690
No, you did it because you wanted to,
and I would've done the same thing,

1227
01:23:02.773 --> 01:23:06.110
except one of us had to grow up
and stay home and look after Ben.

1228
01:23:06.194 --> 01:23:08.196
Certainly wasn't going to be you.

1229
01:23:09.071 --> 01:23:13.534
Did it ever occur to you that I made
sacrifices for us that you never did?

1230
01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:17.705
No, of course not.

1231
01:23:18.164 --> 01:23:19.999
So just go away.

1232
01:23:34.096 --> 01:23:35.598

01:23:40.186 --> 01:23:42.396
Don't feel bad. You did good.

1234
01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:44.523
Patrick believed every word you said.

1235
01:23:44.607 --> 01:23:48.152
Besides, your son would have
never found the treasure anyway.

1236
01:23:48.236 --> 01:23:50.071
You don't know Benjamin.

1237
01:23:50.154 --> 01:23:53.699
Perhaps not.
But then again, I have this.

1238
01:23:57.328 --> 01:24:02.208
A letter from Queen Victoria to
the Confederate General Albert Pike?

1239
01:24:02.291 --> 01:24:06.545
Seems the dear old queen
was partial to the Confederate cause.

1240
01:24:07.255 --> 01:24:10.174
This has been handed down
by my family for 140 years.

1241
01:24:11.008 --> 01:24:15.304
Contains a vital piece of information.
The final clue, as it were.

1242
01:24:15.388 --> 01:24:21.269
This piece of information is worthless
without your translation of the planks.

1243
01:24:22.770 --> 01:24:24.522
It's ironic, isn't it?

1244
01:24:24.605 --> 01:24:29.360
This all began with the burning
of pages, and now it ends

1245
01:24:29.443 --> 01:24:32.989
with the burning of this,
the final clue.

1246
01:24:33.823 --> 01:24:35.533

1247
01:24:36.742 --> 01:24:38.244
...who can find Cíbola.

Get your coat.

1249
01:24:54.468 --> 01:24:57.471
Her translation on the second half
of the planks says

1250
01:24:57.555 --> 01:25:01.100
- we need to find an island of stone.
- Ben would have found it by now.

1251
01:25:01.517 --> 01:25:02.768

1256
01:25:18.326 --> 01:25:21.203
- Wait for me.
- No way. You're too slow.

1257
01:25:21.537 --> 01:25:24.540
I knew you'd figure out
the message I gave your father.

1258
01:25:24.915 --> 01:25:27.877
The hummingbird was good. Let her go.

1259
01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:31.672
We're the ones with the firepower,
and you're giving me orders.

1260
01:25:31.756 --> 01:25:36.010
I kidnapped the president. The FBI
is on their way right now to arrest me,

1261
01:25:36.093 --> 01:25:38.137
and I'm sure they'll love to meet you.

1262
01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:40.348
They'll find us both and arrest us both.

1263
01:25:40.431 --> 01:25:43.142
That path doesn't lead
to the City of Gold, does it?

1264
01:25:43.392 --> 01:25:46.270
This man has information you need.
He's got a letter.

1265
01:25:46.354 --> 01:25:48.689
From Queen Victoria
to General Albert Pike.

1266
01:25:48.773 --> 01:25:51.650
- How do you know that?
- I read about it, in a book.

1267
01:25:54.737 --> 01:25:56.197
I'm afraid he's burned it.

1268
01:25:59.492 --> 01:26:04.205
All right... You've had me do
all the work so far, why stop now?

1269
01:26:04.830 --> 01:26:08.167
You tell me what you know,
I'll find the City of Gold,

1270
01:26:08.250 --> 01:26:11.462
prove Thomas Gates' innocence,
you can have the treasure.

1271
01:26:11.545 --> 01:26:13.422
- What?
- I'm going with you.

1272
01:26:13.506 --> 01:26:17.259
But if anyone's gonna be credited
for discovering the City of Gold,

1273
01:26:17.343 --> 01:26:18.594
it's going to be me.

1274
01:26:18.677 --> 01:26:21.764
But your partners stay here,
and all the guns.

1275
01:26:21.847 --> 01:26:23.516
What makes you think I'd agree?

1276
01:26:24.433 --> 01:26:28.979
Because you need that treasure.
Believe me, I know.

1277
01:26:33.526 --> 01:26:35.778
All right, Gates. We'll do it your way.

1278
01:26:38.656 --> 01:26:42.535
But believe me... I don't need the guns.

1279
01:26:47.498 --> 01:26:51.293
- Which president? The president?
- I thought it best not to tell you.

that looks like a noble bird.

01:27:10.187 --> 01:27:12.148
All right. Let's have it.

1282
01:27:12.231 --> 01:27:16.652
What did the letter say? What's
the clue from Queen Victoria's letter?

1283
01:27:16.735 --> 01:27:22.032
"The entrance shall only be revealed
under a cloudless rain."

1284
01:27:22.116 --> 01:27:23.701
Figure that one out.

1285
01:27:23.784 --> 01:27:27.413
So we come back when it's raining?

1286
01:27:29.415 --> 01:27:33.252
"Cloudless." Could simply mean the sun.

1287
01:27:33.919 --> 01:27:36.922
You need a sunny day... and rain.

1288
01:27:38.299 --> 01:27:39.300
We need water.

1289
01:27:40.050 --> 01:27:41.218
Water.

1290
01:27:51.854 --> 01:27:52.980
Abigail.

1291
01:27:54.148 --> 01:27:57.568
Everybody, the water makes
the rocks darker. Use the water.

1292
01:27:57.651 --> 01:27:58.861

- Good, good, good.

1294
01:28:15.085 --> 01:28:18.339
This is ridiculous.
Are we going to water the whole thing?

1295
01:28:27.973 --> 01:28:29.433
That's it.

1296
01:28:29.517 --> 01:28:34.104
Oh! That's it. I found it.
Over here! Found it! Over here!

1297
01:28:36.315 --> 01:28:37.441
Look at this!

1298
01:28:38.984 --> 01:28:40.069
It's an eagle.

1299
01:28:42.029 --> 01:28:44.657
- Look at that. It's an eagle.
- There it is.

1300
01:28:45.115 --> 01:28:47.868
- "The noble bird..."
- "Will give you passage."

1301
01:28:47.952 --> 01:28:51.455
- Uh-huh. Now what?
- We need to join hands,

1302
01:28:51.539 --> 01:28:56.418
and in a noble manner,
pass over the bird.

1303
01:28:57.586 --> 01:29:01.090
PATRICK: It indicates direction...
RILEY: Somehow that bird...

1304
01:29:01.173 --> 01:29:05.010
...will rise from the rock
and kind of caw...

1305
01:29:05.094 --> 01:29:09.306
You can stand around guessing for a
while, or I can give you the next clue.

"Surrender your hand
to the heart of the warrior."

1307
01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:17.356
And the eagle
is a symbol of the warrior.

1308
01:29:22.778 --> 01:29:24.947
Ben, no. Wait, wait! No.

1309
01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:27.741
That's probably a horrible trap.
Tell him!

1310
01:29:27.825 --> 01:29:29.368
It's a horrible trap.

1311
01:29:29.451 --> 01:29:33.080
It would be a pity to come this far
and not even try, now, wouldn't it?

1312
01:29:34.415 --> 01:29:35.791
I'll do it, Ben.

1313
01:29:36.417 --> 01:29:37.418
It's OK.

1314
01:29:41.964 --> 01:29:43.841
Surrender your hand.

- I am sorry. I... I couldn't resist.

01:30:06.196 --> 01:30:09.658

01:30:19.001 --> 01:30:20.210
Look at this.

01:30:32.139 --> 01:30:34.892
All right, good. Let's go.

1323
01:31:01.210 --> 01:31:02.670
Ben, look at this.

- Patrick. Patrick!
- ABIGAIL: Ben, what is that?

1326
01:31:12.638 --> 01:31:15.641

We both know what has to happen here.

1498
01:48:23.710 --> 01:48:27.130
One of us keeps the door open
and stays behind.

1499
01:48:29.090 --> 01:48:30.174
I vote Mitch.

1500
01:48:31.259 --> 01:48:33.177
This isn't a democracy.

1501
01:48:33.261 --> 01:48:35.763
(GRUNTING, SHOUTING)

1502
01:48:37.807 --> 01:48:41.811
Stop! I'll stay!
I'm staying. Look. Look!

1503
01:48:42.729 --> 01:48:45.231
See? I'm right here! I'm staying!

1504
01:48:45.314 --> 01:48:48.025
I'll tell everybody
how this is going to go.

1505
01:48:48.109 --> 01:48:52.363
You and me are going to open that door.
Anybody tries to leave before me,

1506
01:48:52.447 --> 01:48:54.824
I drop the door,
we start this all over again!

1507
01:48:54.907 --> 01:48:58.828
Try any funny business, I guarantee you
people are going to get hurt!

1508
01:49:00.705 --> 01:49:04.208
I won't! You have my word.
Just let her go.

1509
01:49:08.254 --> 01:49:10.882
Ben, no, we're not leaving without you.

1510
01:49:12.842 --> 01:49:13.843
BEN: Abigail.

1511
01:49:17.972 --> 01:49:21.684
You make my parents leave.
You make my parents leave.

1512
01:49:31.027 --> 01:49:32.320
- No!
- Let's go!

1513
01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:36.783
Let's go, please! Patrick, Emily,
he's trying to save our lives.

1514
01:49:37.533 --> 01:49:39.160
Please, come on.

1515
01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:42.330
Push, Ben!

1516
01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:47.919
The current's too strong!

1517
01:49:51.172 --> 01:49:53.382
- I'm ready!
- It's all yours!

1518
01:50:09.357 --> 01:50:10.358
Ah!

1519
01:50:16.405 --> 01:50:17.573
Mom!

1520
01:50:18.157 --> 01:50:20.409
- (STRAINING)
- Hang on!

1521
01:50:23.246 --> 01:50:24.497
Hold your breath!

1522
01:50:34.257 --> 01:50:36.092
Ah!

1523
01:50:36.175 --> 01:50:37.927
We got to get Ben out of there!

1524
01:50:40.930 --> 01:50:45.226
If I'm stuck in the door,
it stays open,

1525
01:50:45.309 --> 01:50:48.229
both rooms fill up, and we all drown!

1526
01:50:48.312 --> 01:50:52.441
- Open the door! I'll get you out!
- The current's too strong!

1527
01:50:52.525 --> 01:50:55.027
I open the door,
you'll be washed down!

1528
01:50:55.111 --> 01:50:56.487
I'll get you out!

1529
01:50:56.571 --> 01:51:00.908
I found the City of Gold! I found it!

1530
01:51:00.992 --> 01:51:02.994
And no one will ever know?

1531
01:51:03.077 --> 01:51:07.290
We can figure this out!
We can all get out!

1532
01:51:07.373 --> 01:51:10.918
It's not a puzzle!
No more puzzles, Ben!

1533
01:51:11.002 --> 01:51:14.171
We're all going to die,
or it could just be me!

1534
01:51:15.006 --> 01:51:18.467
- Tell them I found it!
- Don't quit!

1535
01:51:19.969 --> 01:51:22.138
- (STRAINING)
- Mitch!

1536
01:51:31.272 --> 01:51:32.315
Ah!

1537
01:52:02.595 --> 01:52:03.721
Thank you.

1538
01:52:21.238 --> 01:52:25.201
- We haven't officially met. I'm Riley.
- EMILY: Oh, hi.

1539
01:52:31.457 --> 01:52:34.043
Sir! It's for you.

1540
01:52:35.336 --> 01:52:36.337
Sadusky.

1541
01:52:37.254 --> 01:52:40.049
- I have my proof.
- Ben!

1542
01:52:40.466 --> 01:52:44.303
We were just talking about you.
Ready to turn yourself in?

1543
01:52:44.387 --> 01:52:48.057
Not quite.
We found the City of Gold.

1544
01:52:48.140 --> 01:52:50.935
Doesn't matter.
You still committed a federal crime.

1545
01:53:11.414 --> 01:53:14.041
Stop. Stop it.

1546
01:53:15.126 --> 01:53:17.461
- Mr President?
- Craig, give us a minute.

1547
01:53:17.545 --> 01:53:21.298
Sir, for your information,
this is the man who kidnapped you.

1548
01:53:21.382 --> 01:53:24.135
As I recall, we were
exploring a hidden tunnel,

1549
01:53:24.218 --> 01:53:27.763
and a door closed accidentally,
and this man saved my life.

1550
01:53:28.097 --> 01:53:29.306
Yes, sir.

1551
01:53:31.517 --> 01:53:33.269
- Gates.
- Sir.

1552
01:53:34.353 --> 01:53:38.899
For the record, after centuries
of exploration, on this day,

1553
01:53:38.983 --> 01:53:42.528
you have brought honour
to your country and your family.

1554
01:53:44.071 --> 01:53:46.991
You've done this country
a great service. I thank you.

1555
01:53:47.533 --> 01:53:50.202
- Thank you.
- Craig.

1556
01:53:51.537 --> 01:53:55.791
I thought you might want to
take a look at tomorrow's headlines.

1557
01:53:57.376 --> 01:53:58.377
Tomorrow?

1558
01:54:06.594 --> 01:54:07.845
Thank you, sir.

1559
01:54:08.804 --> 01:54:11.265
All of you, along with
Emily and Patrick Gates

1560
01:54:11.348 --> 01:54:13.476
will get credit for this discovery.

1561
01:54:20.608 --> 01:54:22.985
And Mitch Wilkinson, sir.

1562
01:54:23.861 --> 01:54:27.698
- Is that right?
- It's true, sir.

1563
01:54:29.325 --> 01:54:32.328
Ben, I am curious
about that favour I asked you.

1564
01:54:33.829 --> 01:54:36.248
Any report regarding
what's on page 47?

1565
01:54:36.332 --> 01:54:38.542
I believe I can help with that, sir.

1566
01:54:38.626 --> 01:54:41.837
- So it's good.
- Life-altering, sir.

1567
01:54:45.508 --> 01:54:49.136
What's on page 47?
Are you talking about the Book?

1568
01:54:52.348 --> 01:54:53.516
What book?

1569
01:54:55.059 --> 01:54:59.105
EMILY: Be very careful with that.
Is that distilled water you're using?

1570
01:54:59.188 --> 01:55:01.440
- Yes.
- Have you catalogued all of this?

1571
01:55:01.524 --> 01:55:02.900
- No, ma'am.
- You haven't?

1572
01:55:02.983 --> 01:55:06.028
Excuse me? Excuse me, sir?
Are you cataloguing this?

1573
01:55:06.112 --> 01:55:09.406
You should've been there
when we picked out our first couch.

1574
01:55:13.369 --> 01:55:14.787
Excuse me.

1575
01:55:14.870 --> 01:55:18.791
Hey, you're that guy...
The treasure hunter guy, right?

1576
01:55:18.874 --> 01:55:22.670
No, actually, the guy you're thinking of
is somewhere over there.

1577
01:55:22.753 --> 01:55:27.216
No. You're him. Riley Poole.
I recognise you from your book.

1578
01:55:27.883 --> 01:55:29.844
- Will you sign it?
- (CRASHING)

1579
01:55:29.927 --> 01:55:30.928
OK.

1580
01:55:40.187 --> 01:55:41.188
Thank you.

1581
01:55:42.523 --> 01:55:45.734
So, um, the tea tables...

1582
01:55:46.735 --> 01:55:50.489
Yes, I'm going to have the movers
bring them to you next week.

1583
01:55:51.448 --> 01:55:53.409
I was going to say
you can keep them.

1584
01:55:54.243 --> 01:55:58.372
And maybe you could...

1585
01:55:58.455 --> 01:56:00.749
...come and move back in with me.

1586
01:56:01.917 --> 01:56:04.712
- No. You used the word "so."
- So?

1587
01:56:04.795 --> 01:56:07.214
So, when you say "so,"
it means you're angry.

1588
01:56:07.298 --> 01:56:11.260
Sometimes.
And then sometimes it doesn't.

1589
01:56:11.343 --> 01:56:13.679
It's sort of like a puzzle.

1590
01:56:15.514 --> 01:56:19.185
And you're so good at puzzles.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

1591
01:56:21.729 --> 01:56:22.938
So...
