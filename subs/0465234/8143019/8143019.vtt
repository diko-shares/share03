1
00:01:16.118 --> 00:01:17.953
He's in the other room.

2
00:01:25.631 --> 00:01:28.217
- Are you Thomas Gates?
- Yes.

3
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.096
We got something
that we'd like you to take a look at.

4
00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:35.516
I hear you're quite good
with puzzles and riddles.

5
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.396
- It's a coded message.
- It's a Playfair cipher.

6
00:01:41.522 --> 00:01:44.066
- Playfair cipher?
- Can you decode it?

7
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.652
Cipher's impossible to decode
without the key.

8
00:01:46.736 --> 00:01:50.865
- What do you mean by "a key"?
- A keyword or phrase.

9
00:01:50.948 --> 00:01:54.493
I believe what you need is right there.

10
00:01:54.577 --> 00:01:56.412
It'll take some time.

11
00:01:58.456 --> 00:02:02.501
Go on. I'll take your diary.
I'll meet up with you later.

12
00:02:24.982 --> 00:02:28.194
...calculate the distance
and you're sure to hit the mark

13
00:02:28.277 --> 00:02:30.529
in about most things
as well as shootin'.

14
00:02:32.948 --> 00:02:37.370
...ready to pour out all over you
like apple sass over roast pork.

15
00:02:37.453 --> 00:02:40.206
Mr Trenchard, recollect
you are addressing...

16
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.711
I'll take care not to
give up my hold on poor De Boots

17
00:02:45.878 --> 00:02:48.381
till I am quite sure of the American.

18
00:02:48.631 --> 00:02:50.925
Ah, that's my own girl.

19
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.137
Augusta, dear, to your room.

20
00:02:58.766 --> 00:03:03.437
...to turn you inside out, old gal,
you sockdologizing old man-trap.

21
00:03:11.987 --> 00:03:15.282
<i>Sic semper tyrannis!</i>

22
00:03:31.757 --> 00:03:33.467
Temples.

23
00:03:35.136 --> 00:03:36.345
Gold.

24
00:03:36.512 --> 00:03:39.849
Cíbola? This is a treasure map.

25
00:03:41.892 --> 00:03:45.688
KGC? You're Knights of the
Golden Circle. You're a traitor.

26
00:03:45.771 --> 00:03:47.815
You're all traitors.

27
00:03:50.025 --> 00:03:53.571
- President Lincoln's been shot!
- Everybody, out! All of you!

28
00:03:53.654 --> 00:03:55.573
Killer's on the loose!

29
00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:02.079
I'd much appreciate it if you'd finish
deciphering that code now.

30
00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:10.045
- Dad!
- The war is over.

31
00:04:12.381 --> 00:04:13.382
No!

32
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.264
- No!
- No!

33
00:04:25.769 --> 00:04:27.354
You're wrong about that.

34
00:04:28.731 --> 00:04:31.066
The war has only just begun!

35
00:04:36.572 --> 00:04:42.077
Charles. The debt that all men...
men pay. The debt that all men pay.

36
00:04:43.913 --> 00:04:45.456
Dad! No, please!

37
00:04:51.128 --> 00:04:53.797
Come back. It's not fair.

38
00:04:54.882 --> 00:04:57.092
Help! Somebody help, please!

39
00:04:59.094 --> 00:05:00.554
So, recapping:

40
00:05:00.638 --> 00:05:04.683
The Knights of the Golden Circle
was a Southern extremist group,

41
00:05:04.767 --> 00:05:07.853
operating in the north
to subvert Union forces.

42
00:05:07.937 --> 00:05:12.525
Had Thomas not burned the legendary
missing pages from the Booth diary,

43
00:05:12.608 --> 00:05:15.528
the killers may have found
a vast treasure of gold,

44
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:18.531
and the Union may well have
lost the Civil War.

45
00:05:18.614 --> 00:05:19.949
Thank you.

46
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.205
I'd like to thank Ben and Patrick Gates.

47
00:05:26.288 --> 00:05:27.289
Thank you.

48
00:05:28.832 --> 00:05:33.587
And say what a wonderful addition Thomas
Gates is to our civilian heroes exhibit.

49
00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:34.672
Thank you.

50
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.134
Thank you, Dr Nichols.
I only wish my grandfather

51
00:05:39.218 --> 00:05:41.428
had been here to see this wonderful day.

52
00:05:41.512 --> 00:05:44.056
Excuse me.
I have a question I'd like to ask.

53
00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:46.892
What do you think happened
to that Booth diary page

54
00:05:46.976 --> 00:05:49.853
- that was pulled out of the fire?
- We may never know.

55
00:05:49.937 --> 00:05:51.397
Perhaps.

56
00:05:52.314 --> 00:05:53.649
Perhaps not.

57
00:05:55.192 --> 00:05:58.946
You see, I have one of those
great-great granddaddies, like you,

58
00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:02.825
way up in my family tree,
name of Silas Wilkinson.

59
00:06:03.492 --> 00:06:06.829
He used to tell a story
about the night Lincoln was shot.

60
00:06:07.204 --> 00:06:08.872
As Silas tells it,

61
00:06:08.956 --> 00:06:13.168
Booth didn't seek out Thomas Gates
regarding the treasure map that night.

62
00:06:13.961 --> 00:06:16.005
It was Thomas who called the meeting.

63
00:06:16.088 --> 00:06:19.008
A meeting to plan
the assassination of Lincoln.

64
00:06:19.091 --> 00:06:21.594
- How absurd.
- That's a lie!

65
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.848
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you...

66
00:06:27.016 --> 00:06:31.020
...one of the missing pages from the
infamous diary of John Wilkes Booth

67
00:06:31.103 --> 00:06:35.816
with the name Thomas Gates written on
a list along with all the other killers.

68
00:06:39.653 --> 00:06:42.406
- And Latin?
- Booth was a student of Latin.

69
00:06:42.489 --> 00:06:45.659
He shouted, <i>"Sic semper tyrannis"</i>
after he shot Lincoln.

70
00:06:45.743 --> 00:06:49.288
- "Thus always to..."
- "Thus always to tyrants." We know.

71
00:06:49.997 --> 00:06:53.959
- "Surratt, copiae?"
- "Military supplies."

72
00:06:54.043 --> 00:06:56.378
Mary Surratt was convicted and hanged

73
00:06:56.462 --> 00:06:59.340
for supplying Booth with
a rifle and field glasses.

74
00:07:03.218 --> 00:07:07.389
- "Thomas Gates, <i>artifex."</i>
- "Designer"

75
00:07:07.473 --> 00:07:10.851
- or "mastermind."
- I know what it means.

76
00:07:12.478 --> 00:07:15.147
He must have planned the assassination.

77
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.233
- I see.
- Could mean mastermind of anything.

78
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.945
You see that?
Burned out right there.

79
00:07:22.696 --> 00:07:25.616
I can only imagine how difficult
this must be for you.

80
00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:28.452
- May I, Mr...?
- Wilkinson.

81
00:07:28.535 --> 00:07:31.246
I'll see if this new page
matches the Booth diary.

82
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.458
This is an outrage.
You're calling my grandfather a liar.

83
00:07:34.541 --> 00:07:38.128
With respect, now you're calling
my great-great-granddaddy a liar.

84
00:07:38.212 --> 00:07:41.382
Yes, I am. This isn't
some garbage from a history book.

85
00:07:41.465 --> 00:07:43.842
My grandfather
told me this story himself.

86
00:07:43.926 --> 00:07:47.346
- I saw the truth of it in his eyes.
- I'm sorry, sir. I truly am.

87
00:07:59.775 --> 00:08:03.237
We'll test this thoroughly,
Patrick, to authenticate it.

88
00:08:03.821 --> 00:08:05.280
It can't be.

89
00:08:06.615 --> 00:08:08.450
Maps to presidents' houses.

90
00:08:09.618 --> 00:08:12.037
Keys to looks that don't exist.

91
00:08:12.746 --> 00:08:16.250
What's the point?
What am I looking for?

92
00:08:17.543 --> 00:08:19.795
Proof, proof, proof.

93
00:08:21.296 --> 00:08:22.631
What proof?

94
00:08:43.444 --> 00:08:46.905
Wow. Is this a book
about the Templar treasure?

95
00:08:46.989 --> 00:08:51.493
Yes, it is about the Templar treasure,
but it's also about other things.

96
00:08:51.577 --> 00:08:56.081
Conspiracy theories, urban legends
and other myths that are true.

97
00:08:56.165 --> 00:08:59.626
- So the author's here signing copies?
- I'm the author.

98
00:09:00.377 --> 00:09:02.045
- You are?
- Yeah. See...

99
00:09:02.129 --> 00:09:04.840
There's a picture of me right there.

100
00:09:06.633 --> 00:09:08.594
I think it's a pretty good picture.

101
00:09:08.677 --> 00:09:11.972
I thought that guy,
Benjamin Gates, found the treasure.

102
00:09:12.055 --> 00:09:15.934
Well, yes, Ben did,
but I am the co-finder.

103
00:09:16.018 --> 00:09:17.978
Oh, I've never heard of you.

104
00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:26.862
Oh, my gosh. Are you Ben Gates?

105
00:09:28.655 --> 00:09:31.742
- Yes. Yes, I am.
- Do you own a red Ferrari?

106
00:09:34.411 --> 00:09:36.997
- Yes, I do.
- Well, it's being towed.

107
00:09:47.925 --> 00:09:50.636
Wait! Wait! That's my car!

108
00:09:57.559 --> 00:09:58.811
Where's the Ferrari?

109
00:10:00.145 --> 00:10:03.190
- IRS impounded it.
- The IRS?

110
00:10:03.273 --> 00:10:07.861
Funny story.
My accountant set up a corporation

111
00:10:07.945 --> 00:10:10.155
on an island that didn't exist

112
00:10:10.239 --> 00:10:13.242
and assured me
that that's how rich people do it.

113
00:10:13.325 --> 00:10:17.955
Then I got audited and slapped
with a huge fine plus interest.

114
00:10:19.414 --> 00:10:21.917
Wanna know what taxes
are on five million dollars?

115
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.294
Six million dollars.

116
00:10:24.962 --> 00:10:26.296
But enough about me.

117
00:10:28.257 --> 00:10:29.591
What's new with you?

118
00:10:30.717 --> 00:10:34.513
Well, my girlfriend kicked me out,
I'm living with my dad,

119
00:10:34.596 --> 00:10:37.766
- my family killed President Lincoln.
- All right.

120
00:10:39.184 --> 00:10:40.644
I need your help.

121
00:10:41.019 --> 00:10:43.939
I can't believe
you have to break into your own house.

122
00:10:44.022 --> 00:10:47.693
Need to get Abigail's ID badge.
She has access to the Booth diary page.

123
00:10:47.776 --> 00:10:49.903
Why don't you ask Abigail for her help?

124
00:10:49.987 --> 00:10:53.365
She changed the alarm code, Riley.
She's not going to talk to me.

125
00:10:53.448 --> 00:10:54.533
All right.

126
00:10:54.616 --> 00:10:59.079
We have 30 seconds after
the alert starts to disable the alarm.

127
00:11:00.122 --> 00:11:01.206
Go.

128
00:11:05.377 --> 00:11:11.341
I'll probably regret asking this, but
what happened with you and Abigail?

129
00:11:11.425 --> 00:11:15.012
I don't know. I don't know.
She started using the word "so" a lot.

130
00:11:15.095 --> 00:11:16.638
"So?"

131
00:11:16.722 --> 00:11:19.766
Yeah, like,
"So, I guess my opinion doesn't matter."

132
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:23.729
"So, you seem to always know what's
best." "So, I guess I'm invisible."

133
00:11:23.812 --> 00:11:26.607
Now I've moved out,
we're dividing furniture...

134
00:11:28.525 --> 00:11:33.071
Women. Can't live with them, especially
if they change the alarm codes.

135
00:11:33.488 --> 00:11:35.157
You did that in 25 seconds.

136
00:11:35.741 --> 00:11:37.743
That's why I tell people to get a dog.

137
00:11:40.579 --> 00:11:42.331
- Got it.
- All right, let's go.

138
00:11:49.421 --> 00:11:50.964
That's not Abigail's car.

139
00:11:54.009 --> 00:11:55.427
She was on a date.

140
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:59.014
Isn't that that guy?
The White House guy?

141
00:11:59.097 --> 00:12:02.768
The White House Easter Egg Roll
is next Monday. Maybe if you're not...

142
00:12:02.851 --> 00:12:03.852
He's weird!

143
00:12:03.936 --> 00:12:06.605
What happens if the kids
don't find all the eggs?

144
00:12:06.688 --> 00:12:09.399
Wow. You work in a museum,
and you live in one.

145
00:12:09.483 --> 00:12:10.734
Yeah, pretty much.

146
00:12:10.817 --> 00:12:13.320
What clever repartee.
She must like him.

147
00:12:13.403 --> 00:12:16.448
All right, let me give you
a tour of the house.

148
00:12:16.531 --> 00:12:19.034
- OK.
- That's actually kind of...

149
00:12:19.117 --> 00:12:20.869
Oh, Abigail.

150
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:24.623
- What are you doing here?
- I just needed to get some things.

151
00:12:24.706 --> 00:12:28.126
- Connor, good to see you again.
- Gates.

152
00:12:28.877 --> 00:12:30.420
How did you get in?

153
00:12:33.674 --> 00:12:36.051
Riley! Come out here!

154
00:12:38.512 --> 00:12:39.513
What?

155
00:12:42.015 --> 00:12:46.311
Hey! What are you doing here?
I mean, it's your house, but...

156
00:12:46.395 --> 00:12:49.398
I sent you a copy of my book.
Did you get a chance...

157
00:12:49.481 --> 00:12:51.108
No, I haven't read it yet.

158
00:12:52.985 --> 00:12:55.570
I know you.
You're the White House curator.

159
00:12:55.654 --> 00:13:00.242
- I'm Riley. We met back in...
- Right. You're Ben's assistant.

160
00:13:00.534 --> 00:13:01.535
What?

161
00:13:02.911 --> 00:13:04.621
Maybe I should go.

162
00:13:04.705 --> 00:13:08.333
- Yeah, I'm really...
- Dinner tomorrow night?

163
00:13:09.001 --> 00:13:11.628
I actually already
have plans for tomorrow.

164
00:13:11.712 --> 00:13:12.963
You do?

165
00:13:14.172 --> 00:13:16.883
- Of course you do.
- But I'm free on Friday.

166
00:13:16.967 --> 00:13:20.095
- Awkward.
- Oh, great.

167
00:13:21.638 --> 00:13:23.265
- Good night.
- Good night.

168
00:13:24.182 --> 00:13:26.518
I cannot believe you broke in.

169
00:13:26.601 --> 00:13:29.229
- What did you take?
- It's just my things.

170
00:13:30.772 --> 00:13:31.940
Hand it over.

171
00:13:32.607 --> 00:13:34.609
I need to see the Booth diary page.

172
00:13:34.693 --> 00:13:38.488
You saw the page yourself.
There is no treasure map on it.

173
00:13:38.572 --> 00:13:42.367
No, it's a cipher leading to a map.
Anyone spectral-image the page?

174
00:13:42.451 --> 00:13:45.704
No need to. The ink writing
on the page is clearly visible.

175
00:13:45.787 --> 00:13:47.998
It could have been erased or faded.

176
00:13:48.081 --> 00:13:51.543
You're the Director of Document
Conservation. You know this.

177
00:13:51.626 --> 00:13:53.587
Not up to me.
It's not my department.

178
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:56.214
That department reports
to your department.

179
00:13:56.298 --> 00:13:58.550
Come on. One look under infrared.

180
00:13:58.633 --> 00:14:00.635
You can have the Boston Tea Tables.

181
00:14:06.475 --> 00:14:07.768
Both of them?

182
00:14:11.521 --> 00:14:13.857
We've been looking
at this page for hours.

183
00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:15.525
There's nothing there.

184
00:14:16.359 --> 00:14:20.781
Ben, I really don't think we're
going to find anything on this page.

185
00:14:20.864 --> 00:14:23.283
In a hundred years,
no one's going to remember

186
00:14:23.366 --> 00:14:26.661
anyone involved in the Lincoln
assassination besides Booth.

187
00:14:26.745 --> 00:14:30.916
That's not true. Do you know
the expression, "His name is mud?"

188
00:14:30.999 --> 00:14:33.001
- Yes. Of course.
- You do?

189
00:14:33.085 --> 00:14:38.006
- You know the origin of the expression?
- Does anyone but you?

190
00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:41.760
Dr Samuel Mudd was convicted
of being a co-conspirator

191
00:14:41.843 --> 00:14:45.472
in the Lincoln assassination.
The evidence was circumstantial.

192
00:14:45.555 --> 00:14:48.350
He was later pardoned,
but it didn't matter.

193
00:14:48.433 --> 00:14:53.188
Mudd's name still lives in infamy. And I
will not let Thomas Gates' name be mud.

194
00:14:55.774 --> 00:14:56.900
- Ben.
- What?

195
00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.777
Look at this.

196
00:15:00.028 --> 00:15:01.238
See that?

197
00:15:02.614 --> 00:15:07.410
- That's quite something, isn't it?
- Yeah. It says "smudge."

198
00:15:08.286 --> 00:15:09.621
It's nothing.

199
00:15:12.499 --> 00:15:15.377
Residual ink
from the facing page. Flip it.

200
00:15:16.044 --> 00:15:17.838
The letters are backwards.

201
00:15:17.921 --> 00:15:19.923
- It's a cipher.
- Yes. It is.

202
00:15:20.006 --> 00:15:22.300
A cipher.
See how the letters are coupled?

203
00:15:22.384 --> 00:15:28.140
Playfair ciphers encode letters
in pairs. This could prove his story.

204
00:15:28.223 --> 00:15:32.602
Unless you decode the cipher,
this does not prove a theory.

205
00:15:32.686 --> 00:15:34.896
That's OK.
We need is a five-letter keyword.

206
00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.274
- What's the keyword?
- I don't know yet.

207
00:15:37.357 --> 00:15:40.110
- All right.
- Can I get a printout of this?

208
00:15:40.193 --> 00:15:43.071
There's a billion words
in the English language.

209
00:15:43.155 --> 00:15:46.199
Got to be a logical...
Let's start from the beginning.

210
00:15:46.283 --> 00:15:47.826
A. Aardvark.

211
00:15:47.909 --> 00:15:51.913
Don't want to rain on your parade here,
but I don't think this is gonna stop

212
00:15:51.997 --> 00:15:55.959
Dr Nichols from announcing
the discovery of the page tomorrow.

213
00:15:56.042 --> 00:16:00.839
No, now, wait. Can't you ask him to
wait until I prove Thomas is innocent?

214
00:16:02.215 --> 00:16:03.884
What if he isn't innocent?

215
00:16:14.603 --> 00:16:18.190
Sir? Looks like our old friend
Ben Gates is in the news again.

216
00:16:18.273 --> 00:16:20.400
What did he find now? Atlantis?

217
00:16:20.483 --> 00:16:23.195
A guy came forward
with a missing Booth diary page.

218
00:16:23.278 --> 00:16:25.322
That's not the best part.
Listen to this.

219
00:16:25.405 --> 00:16:27.490
"On the page are the names
of the conspirators

220
00:16:27.574 --> 00:16:31.578
in the Lincoln assassination, as well
as a previously unknown conspirator,

221
00:16:31.661 --> 00:16:35.290
Thomas Gates. Thomas Gates is said
to be the great-great grandfather

222
00:16:35.373 --> 00:16:37.959
of treasure hunter
Benjamin Franklin Gates."

223
00:16:38.043 --> 00:16:41.922
- I thought my relatives were bad.
- What do we know about this Wilkinson?

224
00:16:42.005 --> 00:16:46.218
- Sir?
- Guy claims he had this page

225
00:16:46.301 --> 00:16:49.638
for 140 years then just suddenly
comes forward with it?

226
00:16:51.598 --> 00:16:53.934
- Why?
- We'll find out.

227
00:16:54.017 --> 00:16:55.310
Better.

228
00:16:56.186 --> 00:16:57.479
Bacon.

229
00:17:00.649 --> 00:17:02.359
- Keep going.
- That's stupid.

230
00:17:07.614 --> 00:17:10.659
- How's he doing?
- Keep working.

231
00:17:12.452 --> 00:17:15.121
<i>We're extremely grateful
to the Wilkinson family</i>

232
00:17:15.205 --> 00:17:16.998
<i>for coming forth with the page.</i>

233
00:17:17.082 --> 00:17:21.920
<i>On the page is a name of a previously
unknown conspirator, Thomas Gates.</i>

234
00:17:22.003 --> 00:17:25.632
- Nichols has bought into it. See?
- Would you stop watching that.

235
00:17:27.717 --> 00:17:29.052
It's on the Internet!

236
00:17:29.886 --> 00:17:33.348
- No stopping it now.
<i>- Gates may have been the architect...</i>

237
00:17:34.266 --> 00:17:36.977
- They have no understanding.
- You know the truth.

238
00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.355
That's all that matters.
You heard the story from Grandpa.

239
00:17:40.438 --> 00:17:44.776
The story? This guy's got evidence.
He's got everything.

240
00:17:44.859 --> 00:17:46.695
We have a story. We have nothing.

241
00:17:46.778 --> 00:17:50.282
For one brief moment,
the Gates family could hold its head up.

242
00:17:50.365 --> 00:17:53.451
- Now we're a bunch of crazies.
- But we're not liars.

243
00:17:54.661 --> 00:17:56.746
Wilkinson is saying that Thomas Gates

244
00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:01.376
was a mastermind to one of
the darkest hours in U.S. history.

245
00:18:01.459 --> 00:18:04.045
And he burned the diary page
to cover that up.

246
00:18:04.838 --> 00:18:07.215
You and I both know he burned the page

247
00:18:07.299 --> 00:18:09.801
to keep Booth's men
from finding the treasure.

248
00:18:09.884 --> 00:18:11.636
That's what we're going to prove.

249
00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.222
- Only one way to prove it.
- Find the treasure.

250
00:18:14.306 --> 00:18:17.642
You've got to find it. You're
going to help me find it. So come on.

251
00:18:17.726 --> 00:18:20.437
Let's hear the story again
from Grandpa Charles.

252
00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:25.066
Grandpa heard his father say,
"Treasure map."

253
00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:29.195
- Then there was a commotion.
- Got all that. Anything after that?

254
00:18:29.279 --> 00:18:32.866
Anything he said,
something he did? Anything at all?

255
00:18:33.742 --> 00:18:35.744
- Wait a minute.
- What?

256
00:18:38.872 --> 00:18:40.999
He took his son's hand.

257
00:18:41.082 --> 00:18:45.170
He looked him in the eye, and he said,
with his dying breath,

258
00:18:45.253 --> 00:18:50.133
- "The debt that all men pay."
- "The debt that all men pay?"

259
00:18:50.216 --> 00:18:52.344
The debt that Thomas paid.

260
00:18:52.886 --> 00:18:54.637
That's five letters.

261
00:18:56.431 --> 00:18:57.557
Try "Death."

262
00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.351
- What?
- It's the keycode.

263
00:18:59.434 --> 00:19:01.269
The debt that all men pay is death.

264
00:19:06.024 --> 00:19:07.108
All right.

265
00:19:12.155 --> 00:19:14.574
It's Lab-ool...

266
00:19:18.953 --> 00:19:20.121
It's gibberish.

267
00:19:20.205 --> 00:19:22.415
- Laboulaye!
- Laboulaye!

268
00:19:22.499 --> 00:19:25.126
- What is that?
- It's a who. Édouard Laboulaye.

269
00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:26.211
Where's the phone?

270
00:19:26.294 --> 00:19:29.005
I don't know.
Can't find anything in this mess.

271
00:19:29.089 --> 00:19:33.051
- Temporary till I find a new place.
- Find the old one. I like her.

272
00:19:35.595 --> 00:19:37.347
- Hi.
- Dr Chase.

273
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:39.557
- Abigail, please.
- Abigail.

274
00:19:39.641 --> 00:19:41.976
- Nice to meet you.
- Have a seat.

275
00:19:45.438 --> 00:19:47.565
Thanks for agreeing to meet with me.

276
00:19:47.649 --> 00:19:51.444
Of course. I was actually going
to call you about the diary page.

277
00:19:51.528 --> 00:19:53.738
- Any news?
- Well...

278
00:19:53.822 --> 00:19:58.159
We actually found some
latent letter fragments on it.

279
00:20:00.245 --> 00:20:01.830
Take a look.

280
00:20:02.997 --> 00:20:05.375
Random letters. A cipher?

281
00:20:05.458 --> 00:20:07.043
- Maybe.
- Gates seen this?

282
00:20:07.168 --> 00:20:09.212
He's the one that discovered it.

283
00:20:10.338 --> 00:20:12.841
- I'm sorry.
- Not a problem.

284
00:20:15.301 --> 00:20:17.929
- I need one minute.
- Please, take your time.

285
00:20:18.012 --> 00:20:19.180
Hey. What?

286
00:20:19.264 --> 00:20:21.724
We cracked the cipher. It's "Laboulaye."

287
00:20:21.808 --> 00:20:23.435
<i>The cipher spells "Laboulaye."</i>

288
00:20:23.518 --> 00:20:27.605
So? Laboulaye was well-known
in France. It could be nothing.

289
00:20:27.689 --> 00:20:31.401
Or maybe there was a treasure map
like Thomas Gates said there was,

290
00:20:31.484 --> 00:20:34.696
and Laboulaye had it.
We only got a partial on the next word.

291
00:20:34.779 --> 00:20:36.948
L-A-D, lad... ladder...

292
00:20:37.031 --> 00:20:38.658
- L-A-D.
- Aladdin! Aladdin?

293
00:20:38.741 --> 00:20:41.161
- Lady!
- Thank you, Abigail!

294
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:45.248
Laboulaye Lady. Do you know
what Laboulaye was planning

295
00:20:45.331 --> 00:20:47.959
<i>right around the time
Lincoln was assassinated?</i>

296
00:20:48.042 --> 00:20:50.128
OK, Ben, I've got to go.

297
00:20:50.211 --> 00:20:52.714
There's a map or a clue to a map
on the Statue...

298
00:20:53.548 --> 00:20:56.176
- She hung up.
- She took your call. That was good.

299
00:20:56.259 --> 00:20:58.928
- Dr Gates?
- Yes.

300
00:20:59.804 --> 00:21:04.184
Sounds like he cracked the cipher.
I couldn't help but overhear.

301
00:21:04.267 --> 00:21:07.312
Laboulaye? As in Édouard Laboulaye?

302
00:21:07.395 --> 00:21:09.981
He seems to believe so, yes.

303
00:21:10.064 --> 00:21:12.484
Man who had the idea
for the Statue of Liberty.

304
00:21:12.567 --> 00:21:15.778
You're saying there's a treasure map
in the Statue of Liberty?

305
00:21:15.862 --> 00:21:19.741
Laboulaye was a Mason.
They built clues into everything.

306
00:21:19.824 --> 00:21:21.701
Did you learn that from my book?

307
00:21:24.746 --> 00:21:27.373
- Have an interest in history?
- Fascinated by it.

308
00:21:27.957 --> 00:21:30.877
Civil War, especially.
My family's descended from

309
00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:34.255
Confederate General Albert Pike.
He was a remarkable man.

310
00:21:34.339 --> 00:21:38.510
But, then again, what is history but
a marker for the deeds of great men?

311
00:21:38.593 --> 00:21:43.765
A man only has one lifetime,
but history can remember you forever.

312
00:21:43.848 --> 00:21:47.018
So, the only question is,
which Statue of Liberty?

313
00:21:47.101 --> 00:21:48.186
Exactly.

314
00:21:49.229 --> 00:21:50.563
Is there more than one?

315
00:21:51.689 --> 00:21:54.192
There are three, actually, Riley.

316
00:21:54.275 --> 00:21:58.696
One is in New York,
one in the Luxembourg Garden.

317
00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:01.616
But he only referred to one
as his "lady."

318
00:22:18.383 --> 00:22:21.135
This is like, impossible,
what you're doing.

319
00:22:21.219 --> 00:22:22.845
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

320
00:22:22.929 --> 00:22:26.933
Laboulaye had to leave a clue
somewhere on here. Move in on the torch.

321
00:22:27.016 --> 00:22:29.852
Let me get there.
It's not as easy as it looks.

322
00:22:29.936 --> 00:22:32.355
No. Believe me, I understand.

323
00:22:36.025 --> 00:22:38.111
Excuse me, officer. May I help you?

324
00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:41.447
Ah, American, eh?

325
00:22:41.573 --> 00:22:43.616
Of course you see no problem

326
00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:46.369
in disturbing everyone's
pleasant morning

327
00:22:46.452 --> 00:22:47.954
with your buzzing there.

328
00:22:48.871 --> 00:22:53.167
You know how much our constitution was
influenced by your man, Montesquieu?

329
00:22:53.251 --> 00:22:55.003
- You know Montesquieu?
- Got it.

330
00:22:57.338 --> 00:23:00.550
Montesquieu, yeah. "A government
should be set up so that

331
00:23:00.633 --> 00:23:03.761
no man need be afraid of another."

332
00:23:04.345 --> 00:23:06.055
- That's very good.
- Thank you.

333
00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:09.892
- I'm astonished.
- I got it.

334
00:23:10.226 --> 00:23:13.062
- I hope you read French.
- May I?

335
00:23:14.897 --> 00:23:16.357
He's a cop.

336
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:22.155
"Across the sea
these twins stand determined..."

337
00:23:22.238 --> 00:23:24.699
- Resolute.
- "Resolute," yeah.

338
00:23:24.782 --> 00:23:27.619
"...to preserve what we are looking for.

339
00:23:28.411 --> 00:23:30.872
Laboulaye, 1876."

340
00:23:31.706 --> 00:23:35.251
- It's a clue.
- "These twins stand resolute."

341
00:23:35.585 --> 00:23:38.254
Let's see. Resolute twins.

342
00:23:39.881 --> 00:23:41.257
Resolute.

343
00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:44.886
Resolute. And then twins.

344
00:23:45.637 --> 00:23:50.558
Siamese twins? Siam? Trade routes
between France and Thailand?

345
00:23:51.267 --> 00:23:54.228
That's ridiculous. H.M.S. Resolute.

346
00:23:55.146 --> 00:23:59.609
A British ship that got lost
in the Arctic in the 1800s.

347
00:23:59.692 --> 00:24:04.614
It was salvaged by American whalers, and
then Congress sent it back to England.

348
00:24:04.697 --> 00:24:07.158
When the ship was finally retired,

349
00:24:07.241 --> 00:24:12.205
Queen Victoria had two desks
made from its timbers.

350
00:24:12.288 --> 00:24:14.666
Voilà. Resolute twins.

351
00:24:14.749 --> 00:24:19.087
- And where are those desks now?
- The closest one is in London.

352
00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:21.464
How fast can we get
to Buckingham Palace?

353
00:24:21.547 --> 00:24:24.133
Don't know. Why don't you ask
your new best friend?

354
00:24:26.678 --> 00:24:28.137
He's going to call you a cab.

355
00:24:30.014 --> 00:24:33.518
- Nice helicopter. Is that yours?
- Yes, actually. It is.

356
00:24:33.601 --> 00:24:36.062
OK, so you get the ticket.

357
00:24:36.646 --> 00:24:37.730
Great.

358
00:24:38.147 --> 00:24:41.776
Mitch Wilkinson studied history
at Virginia Military Institute.

359
00:24:41.859 --> 00:24:45.697
Graduated 1978. Ran a private security
company which had contracts in Iraq

360
00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:48.574
during the invasion,
and in the Congo in the late '90s.

361
00:24:48.658 --> 00:24:52.954
These are trained mercenaries as well as
being black-market antiquities dealers.

362
00:24:53.788 --> 00:24:56.541
So why does a black market
antiquities dealer...

363
00:24:57.208 --> 00:25:00.628
...give up a rare Civil War artefact?

364
00:25:01.087 --> 00:25:05.174
Something he could sell to a private
collector for a good deal of money?

365
00:26:08.738 --> 00:26:10.573
So the queen's office is here.

366
00:26:10.656 --> 00:26:12.742
The elevator shaft gets you close,

367
00:26:12.825 --> 00:26:16.621
{\an8}but the only direct access
is through security.

368
00:26:16.704 --> 00:26:19.999
- That should be exciting.
- We got to get you in that room.

369
00:26:21.834 --> 00:26:23.252
- Hi, Dad.
<i>- Ben.</i>

370
00:26:23.336 --> 00:26:25.880
It's Patrick Gates' phone.
He's calling Ben.

371
00:26:25.963 --> 00:26:27.048
Give me that.

372
00:26:27.882 --> 00:26:30.760
The house was broken into
last night. I was attacked.

373
00:26:30.843 --> 00:26:32.345
Call the police. I'm coming home.

374
00:26:32.428 --> 00:26:34.263
- What?
- What good would that do?

375
00:26:34.347 --> 00:26:37.433
<i>They didn't take anything.
And, besides, I'm fine.</i>

376
00:26:37.517 --> 00:26:40.978
We're in London.
We're going to Buckingham Palace.

377
00:26:41.062 --> 00:26:44.190
<i>We have an appointment
with the curator tomorrow afternoon.</i>

378
00:26:44.273 --> 00:26:46.484
<i>- Son, just be careful. Goodbye.</i>
- Bye.

379
00:26:46.567 --> 00:26:48.444
Someone else is after the treasure.

380
00:26:48.528 --> 00:26:50.905
Of course someone else
is after the treasure.

381
00:26:50.988 --> 00:26:54.826
- It's the axiom of treasure hunting.
- We have to hurry and see that desk.

382
00:26:54.909 --> 00:26:57.119
We don't want to miss that appointment.

383
00:26:59.288 --> 00:27:02.416
- Hi. Ben Gates.
- See security. They'll let you in.

384
00:27:18.558 --> 00:27:19.559
Wow.

385
00:27:42.707 --> 00:27:45.376
OK. It's teatime, chaps.

386
00:27:59.307 --> 00:28:02.435
Looking for the curator's office.
Which way was it again?

387
00:28:02.518 --> 00:28:04.979
Follow the stairs round,
then turn first left.

388
00:28:05.062 --> 00:28:06.689
Thank you so much.

389
00:28:11.569 --> 00:28:13.863
- Ben.
- Abigail.

390
00:28:13.946 --> 00:28:16.157
- What's she doing here?
- What're you doing?

391
00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.327
Your dad called me.
Said your next clue was here.

392
00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:21.329
<i>- She's really there?</i>
- Look, Ben...

393
00:28:21.412 --> 00:28:22.872
<i>- Drop her. Lose her.</i>
- I want to help.

394
00:28:22.955 --> 00:28:25.708
That's very nice,
but it's a bad time right now.

395
00:28:25.791 --> 00:28:29.420
- A bad time, right now?
- It's a bad time.

396
00:28:30.588 --> 00:28:34.175
I just flew all the way to London
to offer my help...

397
00:28:34.258 --> 00:28:36.677
<i>- Remember the plan.</i>
- You don't need it?

398
00:28:36.761 --> 00:28:38.471
You're the one making a scene.

399
00:28:38.554 --> 00:28:41.974
- I'm not making a scene right now.
- We want to make a scene.

400
00:28:42.058 --> 00:28:45.686
Well then, fine! If that's what
you want, let's have it out now!

401
00:28:46.187 --> 00:28:49.941
<i>- So subtle.</i>
- Let me guess? It's the wrong time.

402
00:28:50.024 --> 00:28:52.902
It's the wrong place. I'm wrong again!

403
00:28:52.985 --> 00:28:55.905
Wrong about us,
wrong about Thomas Gates,

404
00:28:55.988 --> 00:28:58.574
wrong that you'd like
the Queen Anne chair!

405
00:28:58.658 --> 00:29:00.618
You're wrong to assume
I'd like the chair.

406
00:29:00.701 --> 00:29:04.622
You see? Everybody, listen to this.
This is more interesting than that.

407
00:29:04.705 --> 00:29:08.167
She thinks that even when I'm right,
I'm wrong! Isn't that right?

408
00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:12.213
Abigail, just because
I answer a question quickly

409
00:29:12.296 --> 00:29:13.547
doesn't make it wrong.

410
00:29:13.631 --> 00:29:17.301
Not if the answer's something
we need to figure out as a couple.

411
00:29:17.385 --> 00:29:19.095
- That's what couples do!
- Sir.

412
00:29:19.178 --> 00:29:21.138
You and your missus, take it outside.

413
00:29:21.222 --> 00:29:25.309
Now look what you've done. You've
brought the little bobbies down on us!

414
00:29:25.393 --> 00:29:28.354
You take the missus outside.
I'm staying right here.

415
00:29:29.063 --> 00:29:30.064
Ben!

416
00:29:31.023 --> 00:29:32.775
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Hello.

417
00:29:33.109 --> 00:29:35.277
- Been drinking, have we?
- Just a nip.

418
00:29:35.361 --> 00:29:38.364
Popped down to the pub for a pint!
Bit of all right!

419
00:29:38.447 --> 00:29:40.408
Going to arrest a man for that?

420
00:29:40.491 --> 00:29:43.911
Going to detain a blighter
for enjoying his whiskey?

421
00:29:43.995 --> 00:29:45.579
- Enough.
- Bangers and mash.

422
00:29:45.663 --> 00:29:47.289
Bubbles and squeak. Smoked eel pie.

423
00:29:47.373 --> 00:29:48.374
- Sir!
- Haggis!

424
00:29:48.457 --> 00:29:52.336
- That's it! Dismount the banister!
- I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts!

425
00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.505
Here they are, standing in a row!

426
00:29:54.588 --> 00:29:57.633
Small ones, big ones,
some as big as your head!

427
00:29:57.717 --> 00:30:00.219
That was brilliant.

428
00:30:00.803 --> 00:30:04.640
- What's wrong with being right?
- Nothing. You should try it sometime.

429
00:30:04.724 --> 00:30:07.768
- You're saying that I'm never right?
- I did not say that.

430
00:30:08.686 --> 00:30:09.979
So I'm wrong again.

431
00:30:10.271 --> 00:30:13.149
- Now, see, there you are correct.
- Capital. Topper.

432
00:30:13.232 --> 00:30:14.859
Your mother told me about you.

433
00:30:18.446 --> 00:30:22.992
- In here, please.
- Why don't you just make a list

434
00:30:23.075 --> 00:30:26.245
of what's OK for me
to say or not write something...

435
00:30:26.912 --> 00:30:29.206
- What's right or wrong...
- You two, stay.

436
00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:31.208
- Right?
- No! No, no, man.

437
00:30:31.292 --> 00:30:34.587
- Don't leave me in here!
- That's great. Wow.

438
00:30:35.171 --> 00:30:36.630
What is going on?

439
00:30:36.964 --> 00:30:40.634
I'm sorry for getting you roped
into this, but you were excellent.

440
00:30:41.218 --> 00:30:43.763
- Thank you. So were you.
- When did you figure out

441
00:30:43.846 --> 00:30:46.557
- it was a fake argument?
- When'd you figure out I was

442
00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:49.310
- arguing during the fake argument?
- The middle.

443
00:30:49.393 --> 00:30:52.313
Where "I assume I'm right."
Get us out. Which I don't get.

444
00:30:52.396 --> 00:30:55.316
If I'm right, after I assume I'm right,
then I'm correct.

445
00:30:55.399 --> 00:30:57.818
When you get to a conclusion
without asking,

446
00:30:57.902 --> 00:31:00.905
and you happen to be right,
you got lucky.

447
00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:04.033
I get lucky a lot.

448
00:31:04.492 --> 00:31:06.619
So where does that leave me, Ben?

449
00:31:06.702 --> 00:31:08.913
You guys are so great together.

450
00:31:08.996 --> 00:31:10.915
You want to know why I'm here?

451
00:31:12.958 --> 00:31:16.337
Think there may be a clue on
the Resolute desk in the queen's study.

452
00:31:18.172 --> 00:31:19.590
Does that help?

453
00:31:19.673 --> 00:31:24.095
Don't understand why it's difficult for
you to include others in your decisions.

454
00:31:24.178 --> 00:31:27.723
Just because you may know
what my answer is going to be

455
00:31:27.807 --> 00:31:30.351
doesn't mean you don't have to ask me.

456
00:31:30.935 --> 00:31:32.978
<i>Door number one, opening.</i>

457
00:31:35.898 --> 00:31:38.025
OK. Let me try this out.

458
00:31:39.026 --> 00:31:42.154
Abigail, would you like
to come with me, please?

459
00:31:42.238 --> 00:31:43.989
Yes. Thank you.

460
00:31:44.073 --> 00:31:45.699
Ridiculous. You're staying.

461
00:31:45.783 --> 00:31:47.701
- It's too dangerous.
- I am so coming.

462
00:31:47.785 --> 00:31:50.371
- Door number two.
- Door two, coming up.

463
00:31:51.205 --> 00:31:53.332
- You're not coming.
- Call security.

464
00:31:53.415 --> 00:31:55.918
<i>You should be near a service elevator.</i>

465
00:31:56.836 --> 00:31:59.255
What are you doing?
Are those for the queen?

466
00:31:59.338 --> 00:32:03.300
Queen's not here. There's
no flag flying. Queen is at Windsor.

467
00:32:03.384 --> 00:32:05.928
- What are you doing?
- See the desk, without you.

468
00:32:07.221 --> 00:32:08.597
- No.
- Don't let her go.

469
00:32:08.681 --> 00:32:09.807
Abigail...

470
00:32:11.225 --> 00:32:13.227
All right. Get in. Get in. Get in!

471
00:32:14.895 --> 00:32:16.147
Hold this.

472
00:32:22.319 --> 00:32:24.613
Will you give me
the flowers back, please?

473
00:32:24.697 --> 00:32:25.739
Yeah.

474
00:32:31.829 --> 00:32:35.541
- What?
- Wearing the perfume I bought you.

475
00:32:36.417 --> 00:32:37.418
So?

476
00:32:38.043 --> 00:32:40.254
So I think it smells kind of pretty.

477
00:32:41.088 --> 00:32:44.258
- It's the flowers, Ben.
- No, it's not.

478
00:32:47.511 --> 00:32:48.971
Let's go.

479
00:32:53.934 --> 00:32:55.603
<i>OK, now turn left.</i>

480
00:32:56.478 --> 00:32:59.231
- Dead end.
<i>- I mean right. Go right.</i>

481
00:33:05.279 --> 00:33:08.616
- The flowers... petals... stamens.
- Good. Good.

482
00:33:16.624 --> 00:33:17.958
Go, go.

483
00:33:20.961 --> 00:33:22.338
That's it.

484
00:33:24.089 --> 00:33:25.591
The Resolute desk.

485
00:33:27.051 --> 00:33:28.427
We're looking for...

486
00:33:29.511 --> 00:33:34.308
...writing, patterns in the carvings.
Could be anything.

487
00:33:37.811 --> 00:33:39.188
Hey, look at this.

488
00:33:42.191 --> 00:33:47.404
- "Malcolm Gilvary, 1880."
- Hold on one second.

489
00:33:48.155 --> 00:33:52.618
Here we go. Malcolm Gilvary.
He didn't make furniture.

490
00:33:52.701 --> 00:33:55.829
<i>He made Chinese puzzle boxes.</i>

491
00:34:04.004 --> 00:34:05.256
What?

492
00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:10.928
I think these drawers
work like tumblers in a safe.

493
00:34:11.011 --> 00:34:14.515
OK, four drawers...
Four-digit combination?

494
00:34:15.474 --> 00:34:16.558
What about a year?

495
00:34:16.642 --> 00:34:21.355
Let me see. Queen Victoria, born 1819.

496
00:34:21.438 --> 00:34:23.274
So you go one...

497
00:34:26.193 --> 00:34:27.194
Eight.

498
00:34:32.241 --> 00:34:33.284
One.

499
00:34:37.413 --> 00:34:38.497
Nine.

500
00:34:40.332 --> 00:34:44.003
- Any luck?
- OK... 1876 was on the inscription

501
00:34:44.086 --> 00:34:46.422
<i>on the statue in Paris. Let's try that.</i>

502
00:34:46.964 --> 00:34:47.965
One.

503
00:34:50.301 --> 00:34:51.552
Eight.

504
00:34:54.096 --> 00:34:55.848
Seven.

505
00:35:00.602 --> 00:35:01.937
Six.

506
00:35:30.257 --> 00:35:31.467
New rules.

507
00:35:32.343 --> 00:35:35.596
These markings, like Incan or Aztec.

508
00:35:35.679 --> 00:35:37.890
I have never seen any symbols like this.

509
00:35:37.973 --> 00:35:43.354
I mean, this looks centuries older
than Civil War.

510
00:35:43.437 --> 00:35:44.813
What do you think it means?

511
00:35:44.897 --> 00:35:48.400
I doubt it has anything to do
with the plot to assassinate Lincoln.

512
00:35:52.279 --> 00:35:54.615
Mayday. Mayday. Ben, get out of there.

513
00:36:00.245 --> 00:36:04.458
- Oi! Where are my detainees?
- OK, let's make some noise.

514
00:36:09.088 --> 00:36:10.464
The fire alarm's gone off.

515
00:36:11.298 --> 00:36:12.633
God save the queen.

516
00:36:13.801 --> 00:36:15.552
<i>All units, go to action zebra.</i>

517
00:36:15.636 --> 00:36:17.805
- What's going on?
- Haven't the foggiest.

518
00:36:20.641 --> 00:36:23.894
Someone or something is causing this.

519
00:36:23.977 --> 00:36:27.231
- Check your primary stations.
- This doesn't make any sense.

520
00:36:27.314 --> 00:36:30.609
Find the source terminal
and check public areas four and eight.

521
00:36:46.458 --> 00:36:50.587
This way, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much. Keep moving.

522
00:36:50.671 --> 00:36:54.258
Keep walking until you're
on the other side of the fountain.

523
00:36:54.341 --> 00:36:59.680
- Excuse me, excuse me. Coming through.
- I got them. They're at the main gate.

524
00:37:17.531 --> 00:37:20.659
- Oi! Sparkle. Come on.
- OK. Here we go.

525
00:37:20.742 --> 00:37:22.286
I'm a little bit allergic.

526
00:37:22.369 --> 00:37:24.538
- Riley.
- Thank you. OK.

527
00:37:24.621 --> 00:37:27.958
- See you later. Thank you. Bye-bye.
- Sorry!

528
00:37:28.959 --> 00:37:31.587
Thanks for waiting for me.
Can I see the thing?

529
00:37:33.088 --> 00:37:34.506
Daniel, hold it.

530
00:37:37.134 --> 00:37:38.302
What is that?

531
00:37:38.385 --> 00:37:41.096
Went to Buckingham Palace,
all I got was this wood?

532
00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.849
Look at the symbols.
Never seen anything like this.

533
00:37:44.391 --> 00:37:46.143
It's an incredible discovery.

534
00:37:47.311 --> 00:37:51.231
- Wilkinson.
- Stop them. Go, go, go!

535
00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:55.777
- He's the one after the treasure.
- I'll drive.

536
00:37:59.448 --> 00:38:00.574
We're in England.

537
00:38:07.748 --> 00:38:08.916
It's a gun! Get down!

538
00:38:11.793 --> 00:38:15.506
- We're trapped!
- Hang on! Keep your heads down.

539
00:38:26.934 --> 00:38:28.060
Hey, who are you?

540
00:38:44.076 --> 00:38:45.160
Sorry.

541
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:59.883
- Ben, they're getting closer.
- What is their problem?

542
00:39:05.681 --> 00:39:07.808
- Go left! Go left!
- Hold on.

543
00:39:14.856 --> 00:39:16.149
Turn, turn!

544
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:18.151
Watch out!

545
00:39:24.783 --> 00:39:25.909
Everybody OK?

546
00:39:31.164 --> 00:39:34.251
- Come on, come on.
- Danny, I want them stopped.

547
00:39:38.839 --> 00:39:40.007
Look out!

548
00:40:13.915 --> 00:40:15.042
Go. Go, go, go, go!

549
00:40:17.711 --> 00:40:19.212
Did you see where he went?

550
00:40:23.717 --> 00:40:26.928
- What is that? Someone's phone.
- It's him.

551
00:40:27.012 --> 00:40:30.223
- Have his number in your speed dial?
- Oh, shu...

552
00:40:30.307 --> 00:40:32.476
This has to end
before someone gets hurt.

553
00:40:32.559 --> 00:40:35.604
Give me what you got at Buckingham,
it won't be necessary.

554
00:40:35.687 --> 00:40:36.980
Tell that to my father.

555
00:40:39.733 --> 00:40:40.901
Moron!

556
00:40:42.861 --> 00:40:45.405
Why are they standing
in the middle of the street?

557
00:40:47.658 --> 00:40:50.577
- Where are these people going?
- Why's everyone running?

558
00:40:54.373 --> 00:40:56.333
- He's right there! Go!
- Move!

559
00:40:58.877 --> 00:41:00.337
Get out of the way!

560
00:41:02.756 --> 00:41:05.092
- I run over a man's foot?
- Watch the people!

561
00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:16.436
Go! Go! Faster!

562
00:41:29.074 --> 00:41:30.951
- Right over there.
- I got them.

563
00:41:32.285 --> 00:41:35.038
- They're still behind us.
- This phone have a camera?

564
00:41:35.122 --> 00:41:38.625
- No. No, it's broken.
- All right. Give me the plank.

565
00:41:42.796 --> 00:41:44.881
Hang on.
We're going to run a red light.

566
00:41:55.559 --> 00:41:59.521
Hack into the London Police database
and get a picture from that traffic cam.

567
00:41:59.604 --> 00:42:02.232
- Okeydokey.
- You can't do it?

568
00:42:02.315 --> 00:42:05.193
No, I can. I just don't like
that you assume that I can.

569
00:42:05.944 --> 00:42:07.404
Why, thank you, Riley.

570
00:42:30.886 --> 00:42:32.012
Get it!

571
00:42:35.182 --> 00:42:36.391
Stop! Stop!

572
00:42:57.412 --> 00:42:59.289
- He's got it.
- What is it?

573
00:42:59.372 --> 00:43:01.750
I don't know, but it's ours. Let's go.

574
00:43:10.342 --> 00:43:13.011
- Abigail!
- Hey, Patrick.

575
00:43:14.179 --> 00:43:16.139
Nice to see you two together again.

576
00:43:16.223 --> 00:43:18.433
- Yeah, well, we're not.
- Yeah.

577
00:43:18.517 --> 00:43:21.978
Oh, I was hoping to get
some of these boxes out of the house.

578
00:43:31.071 --> 00:43:35.158
I can't read the whole thing,
but I can tell you that

579
00:43:35.242 --> 00:43:38.703
these are definitely pre-colonial
Native American markings.

580
00:43:38.787 --> 00:43:42.207
- Easily 500 years old.
- Easily.

581
00:43:46.127 --> 00:43:48.964
I can identify one symbol.

582
00:43:49.506 --> 00:43:52.092
Look at this.
Do you know what that is?

583
00:43:52.175 --> 00:43:54.135
Sacred calendrical? I don't know.

584
00:43:54.594 --> 00:43:57.180
That symbol is Cíbola.

585
00:43:57.973 --> 00:43:59.099
That's Cíbola.

586
00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.519
The City of Gold.

587
00:44:03.103 --> 00:44:04.396
The City of Gold.

588
00:44:07.357 --> 00:44:11.361
"In 1527, a Spanish ship
wrecked on the Florida coast.

589
00:44:11.444 --> 00:44:13.321
There were only four survivors.

590
00:44:13.405 --> 00:44:18.368
One was a slave named Esteban
who saved a local tribe's dying chief.

591
00:44:18.451 --> 00:44:21.288
As a reward,
he was taken to their sacred city,

592
00:44:21.371 --> 00:44:23.290
a city built from solid gold.

593
00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:29.296
Later, when Esteban tried to find
the city again, he never could.

594
00:44:29.963 --> 00:44:35.010
{\an8}But the legend grew, and every explorer
came to the New World in search of it.

595
00:44:35.969 --> 00:44:39.890
When General Custer's search for gold
ended with his last stand

596
00:44:39.973 --> 00:44:44.436
at Little Bighorn, it became clear
none would ever find it."

597
00:44:50.066 --> 00:44:54.821
Ben, can you imagine if the Confederates
got their hands on the City of Gold...

598
00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:56.990
My God.

599
00:44:57.949 --> 00:44:59.534
I'm going to go talk to her.

600
00:45:03.413 --> 00:45:05.790
- You're coming with me.
- No!

601
00:45:05.874 --> 00:45:10.128
- Hey. No one else can translate it.
- There are others.

602
00:45:10.211 --> 00:45:11.588
There are several others.

603
00:45:11.671 --> 00:45:13.965
For ancient Native American?
No one better.

604
00:45:14.049 --> 00:45:17.052
- Who?
- Look, Ben, I can't go with you.

605
00:45:17.135 --> 00:45:20.347
- It's been, what? Twenty-five years.
- Thirty-two.

606
00:45:22.015 --> 00:45:23.224
That long?

607
00:45:23.975 --> 00:45:27.646
There's a reason
why we haven't spoken in 32 years.

608
00:45:27.729 --> 00:45:30.440
- We have nothing in common.
- Me?

609
00:45:31.107 --> 00:45:34.945
Yes, of course. And I'm sure
she's just as proud of you as I am.

610
00:45:35.028 --> 00:45:37.405
- Who?
- His mom.

611
00:45:40.367 --> 00:45:44.496
- Will you relax? It's gonna be fine.
- Sure. Should look at the bright side.

612
00:45:44.579 --> 00:45:48.375
Been a long time. Maybe she
lost her memory, won't recognise me.

613
00:45:49.209 --> 00:45:50.585
I hate her!

614
00:45:52.587 --> 00:45:54.130
We're in the right place.

615
00:45:57.258 --> 00:46:00.470
I'm gonna take myself
out of the line of fire for this one.

616
00:46:00.553 --> 00:46:02.305
- Hi, Mom.
- Benjamin!

617
00:46:02.389 --> 00:46:05.558
Abigail! What a surprise!
Hello, sweetheart.

618
00:46:05.642 --> 00:46:06.643
Hi.

619
00:46:10.563 --> 00:46:14.067
You see? One syllable,
a knife in the heart.

620
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:15.986
- No.
- She can do that.

621
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:18.947
I can also track the whereabouts
of my toothbrush.

622
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:21.992
I was not the one that left
the toothbrushes in Marrakech.

623
00:46:22.075 --> 00:46:25.036
I stowed them both
in the travel case, as instructed.

624
00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:29.249
Yes, and you also insisted
on loading the luggage into the taxi.

625
00:46:29.332 --> 00:46:32.419
- Didn't insist. I loaded the luggage.
- Not the travel case.

626
00:46:32.502 --> 00:46:35.672
Travel case is not luggage.
The case goes into the luggage.

627
00:46:35.755 --> 00:46:39.134
- Who was in charge of packing?
- I couldn't get the case into

628
00:46:39.217 --> 00:46:42.262
the luggage. It was full
with that stupid rug you bought.

629
00:46:42.345 --> 00:46:44.431
You thought it had secret stitching.

630
00:46:44.514 --> 00:46:46.933
- How stupid was that?
- Did have stitching.

631
00:46:47.017 --> 00:46:50.395
- Six phoney green leather suitcases...
- Mom.

632
00:46:52.689 --> 00:46:54.691
I need you to take a look at this.

633
00:46:55.859 --> 00:46:58.361
- What is that a picture of?
- It's interesting.

634
00:46:58.445 --> 00:47:00.947
- We think it might be Olmec.
- It is.

635
00:47:02.282 --> 00:47:04.784
Yes, yes, definitely proto-Zoquean.

636
00:47:04.868 --> 00:47:08.038
We were hoping
that you could translate it.

637
00:47:08.788 --> 00:47:10.373
Yes, of course you were.

638
00:47:13.209 --> 00:47:16.546
This doesn't involve
another treasure hunt, does it?

639
00:47:16.629 --> 00:47:19.424
Mom, this is actually very important.

640
00:47:21.384 --> 00:47:23.803
All right. What have we got here?

641
00:47:24.554 --> 00:47:29.267
This glyph here, that means "bird."
And that means...

642
00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:36.316
"Noble bird."

643
00:47:36.399 --> 00:47:39.569
"Find the noble bird,
let him take you by the hand,

644
00:47:39.652 --> 00:47:42.947
and give you passage
to the sacred temple."

645
00:47:49.662 --> 00:47:52.832
You think this is a treasure map
for Cíbola, don't you?

646
00:47:53.333 --> 00:47:55.210
Well, that is exactly what it is.

647
00:47:55.293 --> 00:47:59.422
No, this glyph doesn't mean "Cíbola."
It means "the centre of the world."

648
00:47:59.506 --> 00:48:03.343
You know, you used to like it. She
fell in love with me on a treasure hunt.

649
00:48:03.426 --> 00:48:07.138
That was not love. That was
excitement, adrenaline and tequila.

650
00:48:07.222 --> 00:48:09.015
I was trying to get course credit.

651
00:48:09.099 --> 00:48:12.602
Treasure hunting paid off,
in case you haven't read the papers.

652
00:48:12.685 --> 00:48:14.854
Had nothing to do with you.
That was Ben.

653
00:48:14.938 --> 00:48:17.232
Ben found the treasure.
You did nothing.

654
00:48:17.315 --> 00:48:22.195
Patrick, Emily, please. Can we
just figure out what's on the page?

655
00:48:24.864 --> 00:48:26.533
Well, that's it, I'm afraid.

656
00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:31.412
These glyphs are only partials.
So you only have half a treasure map.

657
00:48:32.539 --> 00:48:33.832
I'm sorry.

658
00:48:34.624 --> 00:48:36.084
Not that I'm surprised.

659
00:48:38.253 --> 00:48:40.672
At least we know
where the rest of the map is.

660
00:48:41.297 --> 00:48:42.632
What?

661
00:48:43.133 --> 00:48:45.468
You know where it is?
Why didn't you tell me?

662
00:48:45.552 --> 00:48:48.221
Obviously you have
a tendency to overreact!

663
00:48:51.891 --> 00:48:54.769
- I'm sorry.
- So am I.

664
00:48:54.853 --> 00:48:56.312
So where is it?

665
00:48:56.396 --> 00:49:00.984
Inscription on the statue in Paris said,
"These twins stand resolute."

666
00:49:01.067 --> 00:49:04.612
We think the map's divided
between the two Resolute desks.

667
00:49:04.696 --> 00:49:08.199
The Resolute desk.
The Resolute desk?

668
00:49:08.283 --> 00:49:10.201
President's desk?

669
00:49:10.827 --> 00:49:12.579
The president. What president?

670
00:49:12.662 --> 00:49:15.582
- Our president?
- Unfortunately, yes.

671
00:49:15.665 --> 00:49:17.167
But that means...

672
00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:18.585
Wait, so we have to...

673
00:49:19.919 --> 00:49:21.087
The White House?

674
00:49:22.422 --> 00:49:25.925
The Oval Office... to be exact.

675
00:49:28.553 --> 00:49:30.346
Why would I overreact to that?

676
00:49:35.018 --> 00:49:38.855
- That's not what I signed on for.
- Could we focus on the issue at hand?

677
00:49:40.982 --> 00:49:41.983
Thank you.

678
00:49:45.945 --> 00:49:47.906
It's early, pre-Columbian.

679
00:49:47.989 --> 00:49:50.241
- Can you translate it?
- Are you kidding?

680
00:49:50.325 --> 00:49:53.620
This is an extinct,
exceedingly rare language.

681
00:49:53.703 --> 00:49:56.497
Only a handful of people
study these languages.

682
00:49:56.581 --> 00:49:57.957
Where are we to find them?

683
00:49:58.666 --> 00:50:02.045
Universities, I suppose.
But you don't have the whole thing.

684
00:50:02.128 --> 00:50:03.129
What do you mean?

685
00:50:03.838 --> 00:50:07.383
These glyphs here... they're out off.

686
00:50:07.467 --> 00:50:10.553
There's more to the map?
How are we going to find that?

687
00:50:10.637 --> 00:50:13.598
We won't have to.
Gates will get it somehow.

688
00:50:13.973 --> 00:50:18.311
The Resolute desk is near
the south wall in the Oval Office.

689
00:50:18.394 --> 00:50:20.605
Look at this. Look.

690
00:50:20.688 --> 00:50:22.732
Small door on the front of the desk.

691
00:50:22.815 --> 00:50:26.069
FDR had that put in so that guests
couldn't see his wheelchair.

692
00:50:26.152 --> 00:50:29.030
Guys, take a look at this.

693
00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:32.283
This could work.

694
00:50:32.367 --> 00:50:36.120
I believe it's time for you to make
a date with your new boyfriend.

695
00:50:37.497 --> 00:50:38.665
I think you're right.

696
00:50:40.625 --> 00:50:45.171
<i>We hope you're enjoying
the White House Easter Egg Roll.</i>

697
00:50:45.255 --> 00:50:49.342
<i>Face painting continues at 2:00
near the south fountain.</i>

698
00:50:50.843 --> 00:50:54.389
- Is that Connor in the bunny suit?
- Thank you.

699
00:50:54.472 --> 00:50:57.600
I've never been to an Easter Egg Roll.
It's kind of sweet.

700
00:50:57.684 --> 00:50:59.310
Yeah, I love it.

701
00:51:00.853 --> 00:51:05.066
I know you. Your great-great-grandfather
killed President Lincoln.

702
00:51:05.149 --> 00:51:07.485
No. That would be John Wilkes Booth.

703
00:51:07.568 --> 00:51:09.737
Eisenschiml says that Booth was a tool

704
00:51:09.821 --> 00:51:13.241
in a greater conspiracy
that involved men in Lincoln's Cabinet.

705
00:51:13.324 --> 00:51:15.660
Absurd.
Eisenschiml's book's filled with

706
00:51:15.743 --> 00:51:18.705
- spotty research and false assumptions.
- Oh, yeah?

707
00:51:18.788 --> 00:51:21.916
Explain why Lincoln's bodyguard
left his post that night?

708
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.378
Because President Lincoln
was never accompanied by guards

709
00:51:25.461 --> 00:51:28.965
when attending the theatre. Listening?
Especially on Good Friday.

710
00:51:29.048 --> 00:51:32.010
Explain why all the bridges
out of Washington were closed

711
00:51:32.093 --> 00:51:35.263
except one,
the one Booth needed to escape?

712
00:51:35.346 --> 00:51:38.308
OK, run along now,
you impossible child. Run along.

713
00:51:39.934 --> 00:51:42.687
What is going on
with the education in America?

714
00:51:43.313 --> 00:51:45.523
- Hey!
- Connor!

715
00:51:45.606 --> 00:51:48.067
- I'm so glad you decided to come...
- Hey.

716
00:51:48.151 --> 00:51:50.695
- ...with Gates.
- Connor.

717
00:51:50.778 --> 00:51:52.864
We just ran into each other.

718
00:51:56.826 --> 00:51:58.411
Aren't you going to ask him?

719
00:51:58.494 --> 00:51:59.996
- Ask me what?
- Nothing.

720
00:52:00.079 --> 00:52:03.207
- No, really. What?
- I really wouldn't want to impose.

721
00:52:03.708 --> 00:52:08.379
Well, what she means is,
she doesn't think you can.

722
00:52:08.463 --> 00:52:11.591
- Doesn't think I can what?
- She wants to see the Oval Office.

723
00:52:11.674 --> 00:52:15.553
- No. That is way too much to ask.
- No, it's...

724
00:52:17.472 --> 00:52:18.723
- I can do that.
- Really?

725
00:52:18.806 --> 00:52:19.807
You see?

726
00:52:20.433 --> 00:52:21.768
- You can?
- Yeah.

727
00:52:21.851 --> 00:52:26.147
That is so cool, Connor. I have
always wanted to see the Oval Office.

728
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:27.899
Connor rocks.

729
00:52:28.566 --> 00:52:31.611
Well... here we are.

730
00:52:33.029 --> 00:52:34.030
Wow.

731
00:52:34.447 --> 00:52:38.743
Empire furnishings
and crenelated moulding. Love it.

732
00:52:40.787 --> 00:52:43.581
Amazing feeling, isn't it,
standing in here?

733
00:52:43.664 --> 00:52:46.417
- Yes. Amazing, huh?
- Oh, could...

734
00:52:46.751 --> 00:52:47.877
Sorry.

735
00:52:50.505 --> 00:52:54.133
Oh, that's the... The Resolute desk.

736
00:52:54.801 --> 00:52:57.887
Might recognise it from
the photo of young JFK Junior

737
00:52:57.970 --> 00:53:00.515
playing underneath
while his father was working.

738
00:53:00.598 --> 00:53:02.475
- Wonderful.
- Yeah.

739
00:53:02.558 --> 00:53:05.436
But many people don't know

740
00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:08.981
that this desk has a twin
that sits in Buckingham Palace.

741
00:53:09.065 --> 00:53:11.067
- Isn't that something?
- Who knew?

742
00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:13.403
Every president since
Rutherford B. Hayes

743
00:53:13.486 --> 00:53:16.447
has used that desk,
except Johnson and Nixon.

744
00:53:16.531 --> 00:53:17.990
And Ford, of course.

745
00:53:18.116 --> 00:53:20.535
- No.
- Yes.

746
00:53:20.618 --> 00:53:22.620
- No.
- Yes.

747
00:53:22.703 --> 00:53:25.456
Abigail! Did you lose an earring?

748
00:53:27.083 --> 00:53:29.127
I did, yes.

749
00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:32.463
Connor, these were given to me
by my grandmother.

750
00:53:32.547 --> 00:53:36.342
I suppose we should look for it.
Wouldn't want anyone finding an earring

751
00:53:36.426 --> 00:53:39.345
that doesn't belong
to the First Lady in the Oval Office.

752
00:53:39.429 --> 00:53:40.763
- Yes.
- Excellent point

753
00:53:40.847 --> 00:53:43.141
considering we're not
supposed to be here.

754
00:53:43.224 --> 00:53:46.436
- Yeah.
- Why don't we go over here

755
00:53:46.519 --> 00:53:47.854
and check it out?

756
00:53:49.647 --> 00:53:51.566
I'll check over here.

757
00:54:00.533 --> 00:54:03.119
- Do you think it fell down here?
- Yes.

758
00:54:09.709 --> 00:54:13.171
- Maybe here.
- Probably.

759
00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:22.889
Oh, no.

760
00:54:28.227 --> 00:54:32.064
- You did sit on the sofa.
- Oh, the bunnies.

761
00:54:37.445 --> 00:54:39.113
Connor!

762
00:54:39.197 --> 00:54:43.367
- You found it.
- I did.

763
00:54:53.252 --> 00:54:55.254
Thank you so much!

764
00:54:58.007 --> 00:54:59.884
You're just the best.

765
00:55:19.695 --> 00:55:20.780
Thank you.

766
00:55:23.991 --> 00:55:24.992
OK.

767
00:55:27.578 --> 00:55:29.830
- It was empty.
- Someone must've taken it.

768
00:55:29.914 --> 00:55:33.501
Brightest men in our country sat
at that desk for over a hundred years.

769
00:55:33.584 --> 00:55:35.711
- Look.
- Course one of 'em found the map.

770
00:55:35.795 --> 00:55:39.257
- A symbol stamped into the wood.
- The presidential seal.

771
00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:41.217
It's not the presidential seal.

772
00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:44.971
The eagle's holding a scroll
instead of olive branches.

773
00:55:45.054 --> 00:55:47.932
- I'm not sure what this is.
- So what do we do now?

774
00:55:48.015 --> 00:55:49.642
Did none of you read my book?

775
00:55:51.519 --> 00:55:53.813
The eagle clutching the scroll.

776
00:55:54.146 --> 00:55:55.940
- Do you know what it means?
- Yeah.

777
00:55:56.023 --> 00:55:58.150
But it's not something I could tell you.

778
00:55:59.235 --> 00:56:03.155
It's something that
I have to show you... in my book.

779
00:56:09.495 --> 00:56:13.040
- You didn't even open it?
- I was moving.

780
00:56:13.249 --> 00:56:14.834
Chapter 13.

781
00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:23.884
- "The President's Secret Book"?
- "The President's Secret Book."

782
00:56:23.968 --> 00:56:28.097
It happens to be a collection
of documents for presidents

783
00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:31.601
by presidents,
and for presidents' eyes only.

784
00:56:32.018 --> 00:56:35.396
And I'm not just talking about
JFK here, guys.

785
00:56:35.479 --> 00:56:39.900
The 18 and a half missing minutes
of the Watergate tapes.

786
00:56:40.610 --> 00:56:44.697
Did the Apollo really land
on the moon? Did it? Did it?

787
00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:48.743
And the coup de grâce... Area 51.

788
00:56:48.826 --> 00:56:51.954
Come on, Riley.
That's an urban legend.

789
00:56:52.038 --> 00:56:54.957
Is it, Abigail? Is it?

790
00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.168
It's just totally...

791
00:56:57.251 --> 00:56:58.502
- Crazy?
- Yeah.

792
00:56:59.211 --> 00:57:03.341
Because last time I checked,
we pretty much make our living on crazy.

793
00:57:03.424 --> 00:57:06.594
- He's got a point.
- I guess so.

794
00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:09.221
Same symbol.

795
00:57:09.305 --> 00:57:12.683
Released in '66 under
the Freedom of Information Act.

796
00:57:12.767 --> 00:57:14.477
The eagle and the scroll,

797
00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:18.814
the secret symbol
in the President's Book.

798
00:57:18.898 --> 00:57:21.692
So you're saying that
whatever was on that plank

799
00:57:21.776 --> 00:57:24.695
is now in the President's Secret Book?

800
00:57:26.989 --> 00:57:28.407
Ben.

801
00:57:29.075 --> 00:57:31.160
If it was you trying to convince me...

802
00:57:32.078 --> 00:57:35.665
...you'd have less evidence,
and I'd already believe you by now.

803
00:57:40.378 --> 00:57:42.088
The eagle with the scroll?

804
00:57:44.465 --> 00:57:46.842
Conspiracy theorists like to believe

805
00:57:46.926 --> 00:57:49.804
that it's the symbol
for the President's Secret Book.

806
00:57:49.887 --> 00:57:51.472
You bought Riley's book.

807
00:57:51.555 --> 00:57:54.725
Your friend writes a book
about government conspiracies.

808
00:57:54.809 --> 00:57:57.478
- You don't think we know about it?
- But is it true?

809
00:57:57.561 --> 00:57:59.939
Does the president have a secret book?

810
00:58:06.904 --> 00:58:08.155
Do you like ducks?

811
00:58:11.617 --> 00:58:12.827
There is a book.

812
00:58:14.370 --> 00:58:16.163
Why are you telling me out here?

813
00:58:17.331 --> 00:58:19.792
Because inside, I'm a federal agent.

814
00:58:19.875 --> 00:58:22.128
Out here,
I'm talking to you as a friend.

815
00:58:22.211 --> 00:58:26.590
- Where's the President's Book kept?
- Only the current president knows.

816
00:58:26.674 --> 00:58:29.260
The book is passed
from president to president,

817
00:58:29.343 --> 00:58:31.595
and each one chooses
his own hiding place.

818
00:58:31.679 --> 00:58:33.723
You're the FBI.
Can't you get it for me?

819
00:58:33.806 --> 00:58:37.351
Only way you'll ever see that book
is if you get elected president.

820
00:58:38.394 --> 00:58:39.812
Well, you never know.

821
00:58:41.647 --> 00:58:43.899
All I need is a few minutes with him.

822
00:58:44.775 --> 00:58:46.569
A few minutes? Really?

823
00:58:46.652 --> 00:58:48.863
Even if you were married
to the president,

824
00:58:48.946 --> 00:58:51.198
you wouldn't be able
to get a few minutes.

825
00:58:51.282 --> 00:58:54.243
Not when he's surrounded by handlers.
If I get him alone...

826
00:58:54.326 --> 00:58:56.620
How do you expect
to get the president alone?

827
00:58:56.704 --> 00:58:59.832
Before the Civil War,
the states were all separate.

828
00:59:00.166 --> 00:59:03.669
People used to say,
"The United States are."

829
00:59:04.253 --> 00:59:09.049
Wasn't until the war ended people
started saying, "The United States

830
00:59:10.885 --> 00:59:15.431
Under Lincoln... we became one nation.

831
00:59:15.514 --> 00:59:17.683
And Lincoln paid for it with his life.

832
00:59:17.767 --> 00:59:20.269
- So did Thomas Gates.
- Right.

833
00:59:21.395 --> 00:59:22.688
With his life.

834
00:59:24.148 --> 00:59:28.152
So how am I gonna get him alone?

835
00:59:31.864 --> 00:59:33.115
I'm gonna kidnap him.

836
00:59:34.742 --> 00:59:37.745
I'm gonna kidnap
the president of the United States.

837
00:59:41.415 --> 00:59:43.501
- That's not funny.
- I'm your father.

838
00:59:43.584 --> 00:59:46.796
How do you expect me to respond?
I can't let you ruin your life.

839
00:59:46.879 --> 00:59:48.881
Are you out of your mind?

840
00:59:48.964 --> 00:59:52.009
Read my book, and you'd know
you can't get to that book.

841
00:59:52.092 --> 00:59:54.512
Exactly how do you plan on doing this?

842
00:59:55.846 --> 00:59:57.515
I was thinking Mount Vernon.

843
00:59:58.808 --> 01:00:01.060
- What?
- I'm in.

844
01:00:01.393 --> 01:00:04.063
{\an8}Sir, we're gonna have
to move the president's party.

845
01:00:04.146 --> 01:00:06.941
Some historian claims
the Spencer Landmark Hotel

846
01:00:07.024 --> 01:00:09.485
was used for Klan meetings
in the late 1800s.

847
01:00:09.568 --> 01:00:13.030
- Anyone know if this is true?
- I've got the <i>Washington Gazette.</i>

848
01:00:13.113 --> 01:00:17.201
They want a quote on, "Is the president
being insensitive to minority issues?"

849
01:00:17.284 --> 01:00:20.412
- Doesn't matter.
- Get a list of approved alternates.

850
01:00:20.496 --> 01:00:23.165
- What do you have?
- Yeah, I know it's short notice.

851
01:00:23.249 --> 01:00:26.919
The pipe burst in the hotel
that we previously booked.

852
01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:32.007
- There is water everywhere.
- A retirement party for 200 people.

853
01:00:32.091 --> 01:00:34.844
- Gunston Hall.
- Monticello is booked.

854
01:00:34.927 --> 01:00:37.179
So is Gunston Hall and Tudor Place.

855
01:00:37.263 --> 01:00:40.641
The Denby Hotel is available,
and so is Mount Vernon.

856
01:00:40.724 --> 01:00:44.854
- Oh, wow. You are a lifesaver.
- The Denby is great.

857
01:00:44.937 --> 01:00:48.148
Strike that. The Denby was booked.
Mount Vernon's all we got.

858
01:00:48.232 --> 01:00:50.442
Book it before someone else does.

859
01:00:55.114 --> 01:00:57.700
And let me say
what an honour it is to be here

860
01:00:57.783 --> 01:01:00.786
and add my happy birthday to you,
Mr President.

861
01:01:30.399 --> 01:01:32.443
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

862
01:01:32.526 --> 01:01:35.154
Are you aware that you are
in a restricted area?

863
01:01:35.237 --> 01:01:37.781
Yeah, but this is
where the fish are, son.

864
01:01:37.865 --> 01:01:41.327
That may be, but I'm gonna
need to have you move upriver.

865
01:01:46.165 --> 01:01:49.501
Are you aware that according
to article one, section 25

866
01:01:49.585 --> 01:01:53.172
of the Maryland constitution,
I'm allowed to fish in public water?

867
01:01:53.255 --> 01:01:58.135
Are you aware I have the right to detain
you for the next 48 hours without cause?

868
01:01:58.844 --> 01:02:03.265
I am going to go back where
I came from just as fast as possible.

869
01:02:10.689 --> 01:02:14.401
Maybe one day I'll wear this thing
to a party I was actually invited to.

870
01:02:24.161 --> 01:02:27.039
Twenty hundred time check. Station 11.

871
01:02:27.122 --> 01:02:29.667
<i>- All clear. Perimeter secure.</i>
- Hey.

872
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:33.087
You didn't happen to see
a cute brunette wandering around?

873
01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:36.256
- Went to get a drink, she disappeared.
- No, sir.

874
01:02:37.007 --> 01:02:38.509
I've got no game tonight.

875
01:02:45.307 --> 01:02:49.395
Good evening, Your Excellency. Hello.

876
01:02:49.478 --> 01:02:53.482
Prime Minister, it's a delight
to have you back in the States.

877
01:02:53.565 --> 01:02:57.695
Spread the word, contribution limits
not enforced on the president's birth...

878
01:02:57.778 --> 01:02:59.321
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

879
01:02:59.405 --> 01:03:03.158
- Ben Gates. The Templar treasure?
- Right, Ben Gates. Yeah.

880
01:03:03.242 --> 01:03:06.453
- We won't keep you.
- Thanks so much. Always a pleasure.

881
01:03:06.537 --> 01:03:10.874
I can't tell you what a thrill it is
for me to be invited here tonight, sir.

882
01:03:10.958 --> 01:03:14.837
Yeah, you must have
the Secret Service hopping about now.

883
01:03:15.045 --> 01:03:16.213
Sir?

884
01:03:16.296 --> 01:03:18.340
Considering your discovered lineage.

885
01:03:18.424 --> 01:03:20.968
- Oh, yeah. Oh, that...
- Carry on.

886
01:03:21.051 --> 01:03:24.221
I beg your pardon, sir,
but I know what a huge admirer you are

887
01:03:24.304 --> 01:03:28.267
of George Washington. I thought
you might want to take a look at this.

888
01:03:28.350 --> 01:03:29.935
Have a look at that.

889
01:03:30.019 --> 01:03:33.605
This is a map of Mount Vernon
drawn by George Washington himself.

890
01:03:33.689 --> 01:03:36.525
Mr President,
that is exactly what it is.

891
01:03:36.608 --> 01:03:40.362
- Architectural history major, Yale.
- Did not know that.

892
01:03:40.446 --> 01:03:42.239
It belonged to my great uncle.

893
01:03:42.322 --> 01:03:44.450
Got it from the granddaughter
of a slave, Charlotte.

894
01:03:44.533 --> 01:03:47.828
- Happy birthday.
- Always a pleasure. Thank you so much.

895
01:03:47.911 --> 01:03:51.457
Charlotte, who lived here
and worked here at Mount Vernon.

896
01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:54.877
- Yeah.
- And we're standing right here, sir.

897
01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:59.214
This line is an underground tunnel,
an escape route that was never found.

898
01:03:59.298 --> 01:04:02.968
I wonder...
I wonder if it's still there.

899
01:04:06.221 --> 01:04:09.933
- Only one way to find out, sir.
- Maybe we should take a look.

900
01:04:10.684 --> 01:04:12.227
Are we allowed to do that?

901
01:04:12.603 --> 01:04:15.981
I mean, I know you're allowed
to do that. You're the president.

902
01:04:16.065 --> 01:04:17.316
Can I come with you?

903
01:04:18.942 --> 01:04:21.612
- You guys are just everywhere.
- Yes, sir.

904
01:04:21.695 --> 01:04:24.239
- Give my friend your flashlight.
- Thank you.

905
01:04:25.824 --> 01:04:28.118
According to this map, it should be...

906
01:04:29.161 --> 01:04:33.165
It's one... two. In here.

907
01:04:33.248 --> 01:04:34.875
Yeah, should be in here.

908
01:04:36.668 --> 01:04:37.920
- May I?
- Absolutely.

909
01:04:38.003 --> 01:04:39.505
All right.

910
01:04:42.841 --> 01:04:46.261
You know, Craig,
I appreciate you doing your job,

911
01:04:46.345 --> 01:04:48.347
but I have no enemies down here.

912
01:04:49.181 --> 01:04:52.184
In the cellar. In this tiny little room.

913
01:04:53.519 --> 01:04:54.978
I'll just wait here, then.

914
01:05:05.906 --> 01:05:07.449
Over here.

915
01:05:10.869 --> 01:05:14.706
- That's the mark of George Washington.
- Only it's slightly different.

916
01:05:14.790 --> 01:05:18.377
- How?
- These axes, the angle's off.

917
01:05:19.294 --> 01:05:25.134
For it to correspond with the ones on
the map, it should form a perfect V.

918
01:05:31.348 --> 01:05:32.558
OK, what else?

919
01:05:33.475 --> 01:05:35.310
The arrowhead...

920
01:05:37.729 --> 01:05:39.398
...is sideways.

921
01:05:47.406 --> 01:05:49.449
We're all right. Don't worry.

922
01:05:54.872 --> 01:05:56.165
Look at that.

923
01:05:56.957 --> 01:05:57.958
Come on.

924
01:06:04.214 --> 01:06:05.215
Mr President?

925
01:06:06.758 --> 01:06:09.344
We have a breach
in zone nine! There's...

926
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:15.767
- Inform Fairfax, SecTac Channel One!
- Perimeter detail, lock down all exits!

927
01:06:16.435 --> 01:06:19.354
- Gates, what are you doing?
- I'm sorry, Mr President.

928
01:06:19.438 --> 01:06:23.192
I need to ask you a question,
which I know you can't answer

929
01:06:23.275 --> 01:06:26.069
- unless we're alone.
- Two coming in!

930
01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:30.324
I want a sledgehammer, I want a crowbar,
I want a jackhammer, now!

931
01:06:31.867 --> 01:06:33.869
Tom, alert the vice president.

932
01:06:35.078 --> 01:06:37.664
Mr President, sometime between 1880,

933
01:06:37.748 --> 01:06:40.834
when the Resolute desk
was placed in the Oval Office...

934
01:06:40.918 --> 01:06:45.380
Now, one of our presidents found
a secret compartment in the desk.

935
01:06:45.464 --> 01:06:49.218
Hidden inside was a plank
with Native American writing on it.

936
01:06:49.301 --> 01:06:54.056
A treasure map to Cíbola,
the legendary City of Gold, sir.

937
01:06:54.139 --> 01:06:56.475
All this just to ask me
about a treasure map?

938
01:06:56.558 --> 01:06:59.895
That map is a key to proving
Thomas Gates' innocence.

939
01:06:59.978 --> 01:07:04.233
I know for a fact that the plank
is no longer in the Resolute desk.

940
01:07:04.316 --> 01:07:05.859
You've been in my desk, too?

941
01:07:05.943 --> 01:07:08.987
I believe the whereabouts
of that plank is now hidden...

942
01:07:09.821 --> 01:07:11.865
...in the President's Book, sir.

943
01:07:14.826 --> 01:07:16.870
The book known only to our presidents.

944
01:07:17.996 --> 01:07:20.499
It contains all of our nation's secrets.

945
01:07:25.295 --> 01:07:28.006
That's the most
ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

946
01:07:28.090 --> 01:07:33.971
I saw the seal in the desk, sir.
I know the map exists.

947
01:07:35.514 --> 01:07:38.016
You're not going to tell me
how to get out of here

948
01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:41.436
- unless you get what you want.
- The way out is that direction,

949
01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:43.355
and I'll show you.

950
01:07:43.438 --> 01:07:45.524
You don't negotiate very well, do you?

951
01:07:46.525 --> 01:07:47.526
No, sir.

952
01:07:48.402 --> 01:07:49.569
Mr President!

953
01:07:49.653 --> 01:07:51.363
Where are my sledgehammers?

954
01:07:57.202 --> 01:07:58.495
I don't get you, Gates.

955
01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:01.373
You do all this,
you're willing to go to prison,

956
01:08:01.456 --> 01:08:03.750
just to clear your ancestor's name.

957
01:08:04.459 --> 01:08:06.878
The way out is just down those stairs.

958
01:08:08.088 --> 01:08:11.049
Everything I am
is because of my ancestors, sir.

959
01:08:11.883 --> 01:08:14.636
Thomas Gates gave his
last full measure of devotion

960
01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:17.306
to his country to stop the KGC.

961
01:08:17.389 --> 01:08:21.143
When someone dies for their country,
I believe they should be honoured.

962
01:08:21.226 --> 01:08:23.103
"Last full measure of devotion?"

963
01:08:23.770 --> 01:08:26.648
Lincoln is my favourite president, sir.
No offence.

964
01:08:27.899 --> 01:08:31.236
None taken. He's my favourite, too.

965
01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:36.199
Sir, I know the book exists,
and my question is,

966
01:08:36.283 --> 01:08:39.661
"Will you agree to let me see it?"

967
01:08:40.287 --> 01:08:42.998
Even if something like that
really did exist,

968
01:08:43.081 --> 01:08:45.959
why do you think I would
actually just give it to you?

969
01:08:46.585 --> 01:08:48.420
Because it will probably lead us

970
01:08:48.503 --> 01:08:52.591
to the discovery of the greatest
Native American treasure of all time.

971
01:08:53.258 --> 01:08:56.219
A huge piece of culture lost.

972
01:08:56.303 --> 01:08:59.348
You can give that history
back to its descendants.

973
01:08:59.431 --> 01:09:03.643
And because you're the president
of the United States, sir.

974
01:09:03.727 --> 01:09:08.565
Whether by innate character, or the oath
you took to defend the Constitution,

975
01:09:08.648 --> 01:09:11.568
or the weight of history
that falls upon you.

976
01:09:12.235 --> 01:09:15.155
I believe you
to be an honourable man, sir.

977
01:09:17.199 --> 01:09:19.576
People don't believe that stuff anymore.

978
01:09:21.578 --> 01:09:23.121
They want to believe it.

979
01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:50.148
Nearest highway is that direction.
You'll understand if we part ways here.

980
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:57.489
- Gates.
- Sir?

981
01:09:57.572 --> 01:10:00.659
The following conversation
never happened.

982
01:10:01.993 --> 01:10:03.453
The book exists.

983
01:10:04.621 --> 01:10:07.040
- Where is it?
- Where else do you keep a book?

984
01:10:07.124 --> 01:10:08.959
In the Library of Congress.

985
01:10:09.668 --> 01:10:14.381
X, Y, two, three, four,
seven, eight, six.

986
01:10:14.714 --> 01:10:15.757
Thank you, sir.

987
01:10:16.716 --> 01:10:21.596
You'll also need to know
three, seven, nine, four.

988
01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:23.014
Got it.

989
01:10:24.057 --> 01:10:27.686
- And, Gates...
- Sir?

990
01:10:28.228 --> 01:10:33.066
Two hundred people know you held me
against my will. I can't tell them why.

991
01:10:33.150 --> 01:10:35.444
Unless you find what you're looking for,

992
01:10:35.527 --> 01:10:38.321
you'll be charged
with kidnapping the president.

993
01:10:38.405 --> 01:10:42.784
- You know what that means.
- Yes, sir. Very much so, sir.

994
01:10:46.663 --> 01:10:50.333
- I want you to do something for me.
- It would be a privilege, sir.

995
01:10:51.209 --> 01:10:55.213
Page 47. Just have a look at that.

996
01:10:58.467 --> 01:11:01.678
Riley, meet me at the
Library of Congress in 20 minutes.

997
01:11:04.347 --> 01:11:05.348
OK.

998
01:11:12.647 --> 01:11:13.648
Sadusky.

999
01:11:16.318 --> 01:11:19.154
The president's been what?

1000
01:11:21.573 --> 01:11:22.574
Gates.

1001
01:11:27.621 --> 01:11:30.165
X-Y-two-three-four-seven-eight-six.

1002
01:11:30.248 --> 01:11:34.628
X-Y-two-three-four-seven-eight-six.
X-Y-two-three-four-seven-eight-six.

1003
01:11:34.711 --> 01:11:36.338
- Hey.
- Hey.

1004
01:11:36.755 --> 01:11:38.089
We're close.

1005
01:11:48.183 --> 01:11:51.686
- Where do we start?
- XY is the book classification code.

1006
01:11:51.770 --> 01:11:55.232
Stands for special collections,
which means very special books.

1007
01:11:55.315 --> 01:11:58.276
- Where are they?
- This way. We'll sneak in.

1008
01:12:21.258 --> 01:12:22.259
This will be good.

1009
01:12:25.178 --> 01:12:27.681
Here we go. XA... XM...

1010
01:12:33.645 --> 01:12:36.147
Look. Do you have a code?

1011
01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:39.276
Three-seven-nine-four.

1012
01:12:45.991 --> 01:12:48.285
What did the president say
the number was?

1013
01:12:48.368 --> 01:12:50.579
Two-three-four-seven-eight-six.

1014
01:12:58.670 --> 01:13:00.672
Two-three-six-seven...

1015
01:13:00.755 --> 01:13:03.800
X-Y-two-three-three,
two-three-seven-eight... Here.

1016
01:13:03.883 --> 01:13:05.552
Two-three-four-seven-nine-one.

1017
01:13:05.677 --> 01:13:08.513
- Two-three-four-seven-nine...
- Seventy-six, 78...

1018
01:13:08.597 --> 01:13:09.889
It's not there.

1019
01:13:11.850 --> 01:13:13.351
Maybe someone checked it out.

1020
01:13:16.146 --> 01:13:20.317
- Why send us here if there's no book?
- He probably wanted us to get caught.

1021
01:13:30.118 --> 01:13:31.119
Here.

1022
01:13:47.677 --> 01:13:50.555
- What is that?
- It's a six-dial combination lock.

1023
01:13:52.599 --> 01:13:54.517
The location is the combination.

1024
01:13:55.852 --> 01:13:57.646
The location is the combination.

1025
01:14:14.788 --> 01:14:16.748
Yes. I was right.

1026
01:14:17.666 --> 01:14:19.084
Well done, Mr Poole.

1027
01:14:26.257 --> 01:14:27.842
Eagle and the scroll.

1028
01:14:40.605 --> 01:14:41.731
Area 51!

1029
01:14:45.276 --> 01:14:47.779
- Kennedy assassination.
- We don't have time.

1030
01:14:47.862 --> 01:14:48.947
Yeah, it's true.

1031
01:14:52.909 --> 01:14:55.537
Here. Wait.

1032
01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:59.791
"April 1865. Queen Victoria
sends Pike two coded missives.

1033
01:14:59.874 --> 01:15:04.295
The first is received.
Contains information regarding

1034
01:15:04.379 --> 01:15:07.799
New World treasure. The City of Gold."

1035
01:15:08.425 --> 01:15:11.761
Wait. The queen
wanted to help the Confederacy?

1036
01:15:11.845 --> 01:15:15.473
- A divided America'd have been weaker.
- Needed cotton from the South.

1037
01:15:15.557 --> 01:15:18.727
"The second missive was thought
to contain a Playfair cipher

1038
01:15:18.810 --> 01:15:22.731
suggesting contact with Laboulaye,
who'll hide clues before his death."

1039
01:15:22.814 --> 01:15:26.526
The cipher written into the Booth
diary page that Thomas tried to burn.

1040
01:15:26.609 --> 01:15:28.903
- The one we have.
- Exactly. "1880.

1041
01:15:29.654 --> 01:15:33.867
Resolute desk arrives in Washington,
sent by queen to President Hayes."

1042
01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:36.911
Look at that.

1043
01:15:38.663 --> 01:15:41.958
Missing plank from the White House. Wow.

1044
01:15:43.918 --> 01:15:46.463
Here's the final entry
by President Coolidge.

1045
01:15:46.546 --> 01:15:50.592
"1924. I found a plank
in secret desk compartment.

1046
01:15:50.675 --> 01:15:54.387
Plank photographed and then destroyed.

1047
01:15:54.471 --> 01:15:57.265
Borglum commissioned
to destroy landmarks

1048
01:15:57.348 --> 01:15:59.434
in sacred Black Hills mountains."

1049
01:16:02.061 --> 01:16:05.690
Borglum. Mount Rushmore?

1050
01:16:06.357 --> 01:16:11.362
He carved Mount Rushmore
to erase the map's landmarks

1051
01:16:11.446 --> 01:16:13.907
in order to protect the City of Gold.

1052
01:16:14.949 --> 01:16:16.993
Mount Rushmore was a cover-up.

1053
01:16:19.370 --> 01:16:20.413
What is it?

1054
01:16:21.998 --> 01:16:25.376
There's my tax dollars at work,
coming to arrest me.

1055
01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:28.087
Not coming for you,
they're for me. Go to the car.

1056
01:16:28.171 --> 01:16:30.048
- No!
- Go! I'll meet up with you.

1057
01:16:30.632 --> 01:16:31.633
This way.

1058
01:16:40.475 --> 01:16:42.852
So Gates abducts the president,
lets him go,

1059
01:16:42.936 --> 01:16:44.938
and heads to the Library of Congress?

1060
01:16:45.021 --> 01:16:47.649
- Why?
- Maybe he wants to check out a book.

1061
01:17:07.085 --> 01:17:08.628
This way.

1062
01:17:44.706 --> 01:17:46.541
- Dad.
- Ben.

1063
01:17:46.624 --> 01:17:48.877
Get out of there.
I had to move the car.

1064
01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:51.337
FBI, Secret Service all over the place.

1065
01:17:51.421 --> 01:17:54.173
Calm down. I sent a picture
of the plank to your cell.

1066
01:17:54.257 --> 01:17:56.175
- You can do that?
- Yes, I can do that.

1067
01:17:56.259 --> 01:17:57.886
<i>Did you get it?</i>

1068
01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:00.054
<i>- I got it.
- Look.</i>

1069
01:18:01.764 --> 01:18:05.810
<i>- Take it to Mom for translation.</i>
- Why me?

1070
01:18:05.894 --> 01:18:07.937
He say his mom
could translate the plank?

1071
01:18:08.021 --> 01:18:09.939
Find out who she is.

1072
01:18:21.159 --> 01:18:23.870
- How are we going to find Ben?
- I don't know.

1073
01:18:23.953 --> 01:18:25.830
- Hold it! Who are you?
- We work here.

1074
01:18:25.914 --> 01:18:28.082
- IDs.
- Here. We were told to evacuate.

1075
01:18:28.166 --> 01:18:29.876
I don't know what's going on.

1076
01:18:29.959 --> 01:18:32.545
- My car's parked...
- One second I'm reading...

1077
01:18:32.629 --> 01:18:36.090
- Special section for...
- ...a book, then we're rushed out...

1078
01:18:36.174 --> 01:18:37.759
- Go ahead.
- OK. Thank you.

1079
01:18:37.842 --> 01:18:40.929
- Thank you for your help, officer.
- Best of luck.

1080
01:18:43.181 --> 01:18:44.223
Have a good night.

1081
01:18:47.852 --> 01:18:51.064
Hey, go to the northeast sectors...

1082
01:18:54.525 --> 01:18:55.860
Start the car.

1083
01:18:58.988 --> 01:19:00.114
Put it in gear.

1084
01:19:03.034 --> 01:19:05.244
What's the problem?
It's clear. Let's go!

1085
01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:07.163
We're going to jail.

1086
01:19:10.249 --> 01:19:12.043
I want to run a check...

1087
01:19:14.921 --> 01:19:16.214
Get in! Hang on!

1088
01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.050
Mercedes SUV...

1089
01:19:19.133 --> 01:19:21.094
- He's in! Go!
- Hang on!

1090
01:19:24.681 --> 01:19:25.765
OK. We can do this.

1091
01:19:29.978 --> 01:19:32.105
Close the barricade, lock it down!

1092
01:19:32.188 --> 01:19:34.273
<i>Lock it down!</i>

1093
01:19:36.985 --> 01:19:38.820
- Drive, drive, drive!
- OK.

1094
01:19:40.989 --> 01:19:42.657
I don't think so!

1095
01:19:49.038 --> 01:19:51.332
Go, go, go, go, go!

1096
01:19:51.416 --> 01:19:53.710
Let's go! Let's go!

1097
01:19:56.254 --> 01:19:58.756
That did not turn out
the way it was supposed to!

1098
01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:01.509
- How'd they find us so quick?
- I'll tell you how.

1099
01:20:01.592 --> 01:20:05.221
- The president is a tattletale!
- Sadusky. He was there.

1100
01:20:05.304 --> 01:20:07.640
He knows more about the book
than I thought.

1101
01:20:07.724 --> 01:20:10.435
How'd the president
feel about being kidnapped?

1102
01:20:10.977 --> 01:20:12.103
He was OK.

1103
01:20:18.484 --> 01:20:21.404
- Dr Appleton.
- This office is closed. I'm sorry.

1104
01:20:21.487 --> 01:20:23.948
I do apologise
for the lateness of the hour.

1105
01:20:25.324 --> 01:20:26.993
My name is Mitch Wilkinson.

1106
01:20:27.618 --> 01:20:31.247
I've got something I want you
to take a look at. Just take a minute.

1107
01:20:39.005 --> 01:20:41.299
- You're a treasure hunter.
- No, ma'am.

1108
01:20:41.382 --> 01:20:44.135
I'm just a man trying
to make his mark on history.

1109
01:20:44.677 --> 01:20:46.012
Can you help me?

1110
01:20:48.306 --> 01:20:51.726
No, I don't know that language.
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

1111
01:20:53.227 --> 01:20:54.312
Excuse me.

1112
01:20:57.482 --> 01:20:58.483
Yes.

1113
01:21:00.151 --> 01:21:01.152
Got it.

1114
01:21:02.236 --> 01:21:05.990
Your ex-husband's on his way up.
He wants the translation.

1115
01:21:07.450 --> 01:21:12.622
Tell him anything but the truth.
Get rid of him. His life depends on it.

1116
01:21:22.256 --> 01:21:23.841
Emily?

1117
01:21:36.521 --> 01:21:38.773
I know I'm the last person
you want to see,

1118
01:21:38.856 --> 01:21:44.112
and I'm not comfortable either,
but we need you to translate something.

1119
01:21:45.863 --> 01:21:50.118
- Ben sent me. He needs your help.
- Yes, of course.

1120
01:21:51.410 --> 01:21:53.412
If it's for Ben, of course. What is it?

1121
01:21:56.874 --> 01:21:59.627
It's in the cell phone.
I'm not sure how to...

1122
01:21:59.710 --> 01:22:01.712
- Give it to me.
- ...bring it out.

1123
01:22:09.595 --> 01:22:12.014
We know it leads to Mount Rushmore.

1124
01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:19.272
Yes. "Islands...
Islands of stone in a sea of grass."

1125
01:22:19.355 --> 01:22:23.985
That's what the Lakota used to call
the Black Hills in South Dakota.

1126
01:22:24.694 --> 01:22:25.695
Right.

1127
01:22:28.948 --> 01:22:33.369
"Find where the moon touches the earth
and release the hummingbird."

1128
01:22:37.915 --> 01:22:39.000
That's it?

1129
01:22:46.591 --> 01:22:50.928
Did it ever occur to you...
I can't believe I'm saying this.

1130
01:22:52.138 --> 01:22:56.100
Did it ever occur to you that I did
the things I did to impress you?

1131
01:22:58.853 --> 01:23:02.690
No, you did it because you wanted to,
and I would've done the same thing,

1132
01:23:02.773 --> 01:23:06.110
except one of us had to grow up
and stay home and look after Ben.

1133
01:23:06.194 --> 01:23:08.196
Certainly wasn't going to be you.

1134
01:23:09.071 --> 01:23:13.534
Did it ever occur to you that I made
sacrifices for us that you never did?

1135
01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:17.413
No, of course not.

1136
01:23:18.164 --> 01:23:19.999
So just go away.

1137
01:23:34.096 --> 01:23:35.598
Lousy tequila.

1138
01:23:40.186 --> 01:23:42.396
Don't feel bad. You did good.

1139
01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:44.523
Patrick believed every word you said.

1140
01:23:44.607 --> 01:23:48.152
Besides, your son would have
never found the treasure anyway.

1141
01:23:48.236 --> 01:23:50.071
You don't know Benjamin.

1142
01:23:50.154 --> 01:23:53.699
Perhaps not.
But then again, I have this.

1143
01:23:57.328 --> 01:24:02.208
A letter from Queen Victoria to
the Confederate General Albert Pike?

1144
01:24:02.291 --> 01:24:06.545
Seems the dear old queen
was partial to the Confederate cause.

1145
01:24:07.255 --> 01:24:10.174
This has been handed down
by my family for 140 years.

1146
01:24:11.008 --> 01:24:15.304
Contains a vital piece of information.
The final clue, as it were.

1147
01:24:15.388 --> 01:24:21.269
This piece of information is worthless
without your translation of the planks.

1148
01:24:22.770 --> 01:24:24.522
It's ironic, isn't it?

1149
01:24:24.605 --> 01:24:29.360
This all began with the burning
of pages, and now it ends

1150
01:24:29.443 --> 01:24:32.989
with the burning of this,
the final clue.

1151
01:24:33.823 --> 01:24:35.533
Making me the only one...

1152
01:24:36.742 --> 01:24:38.244
...who can find Cíbola.

1153
01:24:40.538 --> 01:24:41.580
Get your coat.

1154
01:24:54.468 --> 01:24:57.471
Her translation on the second half
of the planks says

1155
01:24:57.555 --> 01:25:01.100
- we need to find an island of stone.
- Ben would have found it by now.

1156
01:25:01.517 --> 01:25:02.768
I don't think so.

1157
01:25:10.568 --> 01:25:12.403
How do I get to this...

1158
01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:15.531
Hello, Mitch.

1159
01:25:17.199 --> 01:25:18.242
Mom...

1160
01:25:18.326 --> 01:25:21.203
- Wait for me.
- No way. You're too slow.

1161
01:25:21.537 --> 01:25:24.540
I knew you'd figure out
the message I gave your father.

1162
01:25:24.915 --> 01:25:27.877
The hummingbird was good. Let her go.

1163
01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:31.672
We're the ones with the firepower,
and you're giving me orders.

1164
01:25:31.756 --> 01:25:36.010
I kidnapped the president. The FBI
is on their way right now to arrest me,

1165
01:25:36.093 --> 01:25:38.137
and I'm sure they'll love to meet you.

1166
01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:40.348
They'll find us both and arrest us both.

1167
01:25:40.431 --> 01:25:43.142
That path doesn't lead
to the City of Gold, does it?

1168
01:25:43.392 --> 01:25:46.270
This man has information you need.
He's got a letter.

1169
01:25:46.354 --> 01:25:48.689
From Queen Victoria
to General Albert Pike.

1170
01:25:48.773 --> 01:25:51.650
- How do you know that?
- I read about it, in a book.

1171
01:25:54.737 --> 01:25:56.197
I'm afraid he's burned it.

1172
01:25:59.492 --> 01:26:04.205
All right... You've had me do
all the work so far, why stop now?

1173
01:26:04.830 --> 01:26:08.167
You tell me what you know,
I'll find the City of Gold,

1174
01:26:08.250 --> 01:26:11.462
prove Thomas Gates' innocence,
you can have the treasure.

1175
01:26:11.545 --> 01:26:13.422
- What?
- I'm going with you.

1176
01:26:13.506 --> 01:26:17.259
But if anyone's gonna be credited
for discovering the City of Gold,

1177
01:26:17.343 --> 01:26:18.594
it's going to be me.

1178
01:26:18.677 --> 01:26:21.764
But your partners stay here,
and all the guns.

1179
01:26:21.847 --> 01:26:23.516
What makes you think I'd agree?

1180
01:26:24.433 --> 01:26:28.979
Because you need that treasure.
Believe me, I know.

1181
01:26:33.526 --> 01:26:35.778
All right, Gates. We'll do it your way.

1182
01:26:38.656 --> 01:26:42.535
But believe me... I don't need the guns.

1183
01:26:47.498 --> 01:26:51.293
- Which president? The president?
- I thought it best not to tell you.

1184
01:27:04.598 --> 01:27:08.269
I still don't see anything
that looks like a noble bird.

1185
01:27:10.187 --> 01:27:12.148
All right. Let's have it.

1186
01:27:12.231 --> 01:27:16.652
What did the letter say? What's
the clue from Queen Victoria's letter?

1187
01:27:16.735 --> 01:27:22.032
"The entrance shall only be revealed
under a cloudless rain."

1188
01:27:22.116 --> 01:27:23.701
Figure that one out.

1189
01:27:23.784 --> 01:27:27.413
So we come back when it's raining?

1190
01:27:29.415 --> 01:27:33.252
"Cloudless." Could simply mean the sun.

1191
01:27:33.919 --> 01:27:36.922
You need a sunny day... and rain.

1192
01:27:38.299 --> 01:27:39.300
We need water.

1193
01:27:40.050 --> 01:27:41.218
Water.

1194
01:27:51.854 --> 01:27:52.980
Abigail.

1195
01:27:54.148 --> 01:27:57.568
Everybody, the water makes
the rocks darker. Use the water.

1196
01:27:57.651 --> 01:27:58.861
Em? Water?

1197
01:27:58.944 --> 01:28:03.073
- What's this in my hand? Are you blind?
- Good, good, good.

1198
01:28:15.085 --> 01:28:18.339
This is ridiculous.
Are we going to water the whole thing?

1199
01:28:27.973 --> 01:28:28.974
That's it.

1200
01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:34.104
That's it. I found it.
Over here! Found it! Over here!

1201
01:28:36.315 --> 01:28:37.441
Look at this!

1202
01:28:38.984 --> 01:28:40.069
It's an eagle.

1203
01:28:42.029 --> 01:28:44.657
- Look at that. It's an eagle.
- There it is.

1204
01:28:45.115 --> 01:28:47.868
- "The noble bird..."
- "Will give you passage."

1205
01:28:49.036 --> 01:28:51.455
- Now what?
- We need to join hands,

1206
01:28:51.539 --> 01:28:56.418
and in a noble manner,
pass over the bird.

1207
01:28:57.586 --> 01:29:01.090
- Maybe it indicates a direction...
- Then somehow that bird...

1208
01:29:01.173 --> 01:29:05.010
...will rise from the rock
and kind of caw...

1209
01:29:05.094 --> 01:29:09.306
You can stand around guessing for
a while or I can give you the next clue.

1210
01:29:10.599 --> 01:29:13.477
"Surrender your hand
to the heart of the warrior."

1211
01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:17.356
And the eagle
is a symbol of the warrior.

1212
01:29:22.778 --> 01:29:24.947
Ben, no. Wait, wait! No.

1213
01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:27.741
That's probably a horrible trap.
Tell him!

1214
01:29:27.825 --> 01:29:29.368
It's a horrible trap.

1215
01:29:29.451 --> 01:29:33.080
It would be a pity to come this far
and not even try, now, wouldn't it?

1216
01:29:34.415 --> 01:29:35.791
I'll do it, Ben.

1217
01:29:36.417 --> 01:29:37.418
It's OK.

1218
01:29:41.964 --> 01:29:43.841
Surrender your hand.

1219
01:30:00.858 --> 01:30:03.944
I am sorry. I couldn't resist.

1220
01:30:06.196 --> 01:30:09.658
It... feels like a latch.

1221
01:30:19.001 --> 01:30:20.210
Look at this.

1222
01:30:32.139 --> 01:30:34.892
All right, good. Let's go.

1223
01:31:01.210 --> 01:31:02.670
Ben, look at this.

1224
01:31:03.587 --> 01:31:05.756
That's beautiful!

1225
01:31:09.510 --> 01:31:12.554
- Patrick. Patrick!
- Ben, what is that?

1226
01:31:12.638 --> 01:31:15.641
Appears to be a counterweight
to hold the door open.

1227
01:31:15.724 --> 01:31:19.228
- What is that sound?
- Fascinating.

1228
01:31:36.620 --> 01:31:37.913
Sorry.

1229
01:31:37.996 --> 01:31:39.623
- You OK?
- No.

1230
01:31:40.082 --> 01:31:41.083
Get up.

1231
01:31:42.918 --> 01:31:43.918
It's locked.

1232
01:31:43.961 --> 01:31:48.716
- Patrick, what have you done?
- Some kind of a bolt. I didn't do it.

1233
01:31:48.799 --> 01:31:50.801
Only one way out of here now.

1234
01:31:52.845 --> 01:31:54.096
Forward.

1235
01:32:06.650 --> 01:32:09.069
Never seen so many relics.

1236
01:32:09.153 --> 01:32:11.238
So beautifully preserved.

1237
01:32:14.575 --> 01:32:17.244
Looks like we're going
to be moving some rocks.

1238
01:32:17.327 --> 01:32:20.748
- There's a tunnel back in through here.
- Guys, look at this.

1239
01:32:23.792 --> 01:32:25.335
It's a little golden man.

1240
01:32:27.921 --> 01:32:32.760
Look. It's got a tiny little torso.
Look at that. It looks like...

1241
01:32:45.898 --> 01:32:47.691
- Ben!
- Ben!

1242
01:32:53.447 --> 01:32:56.700
Move back! Move back!
All of you! Other side!

1243
01:32:59.661 --> 01:33:00.788
Back up! Back up!

1244
01:33:07.169 --> 01:33:09.129
Riley, move forward! Move forward!

1245
01:33:10.255 --> 01:33:11.715
No, back up, back up.

1246
01:33:13.884 --> 01:33:15.969
- What you want me to do?
- Stop! Stop!

1247
01:33:19.681 --> 01:33:23.393
We have to balance our weight
to even this thing out.

1248
01:33:26.563 --> 01:33:28.607
- We'll find 'em.
- What are we gonna do?

1249
01:33:28.690 --> 01:33:31.401
Figure something.
Tell you what we're going to do.

1250
01:33:31.485 --> 01:33:33.821
- No, I'll tell you.
- No. I'll tell you!

1251
01:33:33.904 --> 01:33:36.740
No, I'll tell you!
There's that passageway.

1252
01:33:36.824 --> 01:33:41.078
You go, pull those stones out,
because that leads somewhere.

1253
01:33:41.161 --> 01:33:43.288
That is a good idea.

1254
01:33:46.834 --> 01:33:49.962
There's nothing.
Just a big old black hole.

1255
01:33:53.882 --> 01:33:55.801
Ben, look at this! There's a ladder.

1256
01:33:56.426 --> 01:34:00.472
- I mean, what's left of a ladder.
- Toss me the light.

1257
01:34:02.975 --> 01:34:06.353
Riley. Move slowly to that corner.
No! Wait.

1258
01:34:06.937 --> 01:34:10.107
- As I move to this corner.
- OK.

1259
01:34:12.276 --> 01:34:13.735
One step at a time. Good.

1260
01:34:18.115 --> 01:34:21.243
If we can raise this corner,
I think I'll reach it.

1261
01:34:24.788 --> 01:34:27.040
- Stop! Red light!
- You're not helping!

1262
01:34:27.124 --> 01:34:29.167
I can get up there just as easy as you.

1263
01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:32.421
Just stop.

1264
01:34:33.881 --> 01:34:36.049
- Guys!
- It's three against one here.

1265
01:34:36.133 --> 01:34:39.803
I ain't going last, and if I'm not
going last, I might as well go first.

1266
01:34:41.138 --> 01:34:42.139
Look!

1267
01:34:45.017 --> 01:34:46.310
What's it going to be?

1268
01:34:56.069 --> 01:34:57.321
We'll do this your way.

1269
01:35:11.877 --> 01:35:15.756
The rest of us, on my count of three,
all move together.

1270
01:35:15.839 --> 01:35:17.341
One step at a time.

1271
01:35:18.175 --> 01:35:21.178
One, two, three.

1272
01:35:40.530 --> 01:35:42.157
- You ready?
- Go.

1273
01:36:16.024 --> 01:36:18.026
Mitch, what do you see?

1274
01:36:19.319 --> 01:36:20.904
Is there a way out?

1275
01:36:22.489 --> 01:36:24.032
What's up there, Mitch?

1276
01:36:37.087 --> 01:36:42.551
- Are you all right?
- Just promise me he's gonna be OK.

1277
01:36:47.180 --> 01:36:48.265
All right.

1278
01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:51.226
Let's go.

1279
01:36:52.227 --> 01:36:54.688
Mitch! Come on!

1280
01:36:55.439 --> 01:36:58.150
- I've been doing the math here, and...
- I know.

1281
01:36:58.608 --> 01:37:01.028
We're gonna have to leave
one person behind.

1282
01:37:01.111 --> 01:37:03.196
Just promise you'll come back for me.

1283
01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:05.032
I can do the math, too.

1284
01:37:06.450 --> 01:37:09.119
- That makes you next.
- I'll go last.

1285
01:37:10.787 --> 01:37:15.292
"No, we'll figure something else out."
"We need you there. Please, Riley."

1286
01:37:17.044 --> 01:37:18.211
I'm just kidding. Go.

1287
01:37:18.712 --> 01:37:20.297
OK...

1288
01:37:49.201 --> 01:37:53.872
- One... two... three!
- Go!

1289
01:38:01.004 --> 01:38:03.173
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1290
01:38:08.678 --> 01:38:09.721
I can't get it.

1291
01:38:16.770 --> 01:38:18.772
Just go! Go now! Go!

1292
01:38:21.274 --> 01:38:23.735
- All right, ready?
- Now!

1293
01:38:25.487 --> 01:38:27.239
Riley! Hang on!

1294
01:38:30.242 --> 01:38:34.788
OK. Mitch, the idol.
OK, Ben. We found a gold idol here!

1295
01:38:34.871 --> 01:38:37.541
We can roll it over
to offset your weight!

1296
01:38:37.624 --> 01:38:39.000
Then roll it!

1297
01:38:42.295 --> 01:38:43.296
Here it comes!

1298
01:38:52.139 --> 01:38:53.557
Come on, Ben!

1299
01:38:56.393 --> 01:38:58.145
Here! Give me your hand!

1300
01:39:00.564 --> 01:39:02.065
Ben!

1301
01:39:03.233 --> 01:39:04.317
Thanks, Riley.

1302
01:39:07.571 --> 01:39:09.447
Why couldn't a girl see me do that?

1303
01:39:13.451 --> 01:39:17.247
- You all right?
- You're OK. You're OK. You're OK.

1304
01:39:19.583 --> 01:39:21.751
So... forward.

1305
01:39:25.297 --> 01:39:26.423
What is this?

1306
01:39:38.894 --> 01:39:40.729
Put your light over there.

1307
01:39:43.690 --> 01:39:45.150
What are you doing?

1308
01:40:11.218 --> 01:40:13.678
I can't see anything! Is this it?

1309
01:40:19.184 --> 01:40:20.185
It's oil!

1310
01:40:59.307 --> 01:41:02.686
It's a dead end!
There's no way out!

1311
01:41:03.353 --> 01:41:04.854
We have to turn back!

1312
01:41:14.447 --> 01:41:15.782
OK.

1313
01:41:18.368 --> 01:41:21.371
No. No, Patrick, this is crazy.

1314
01:41:24.249 --> 01:41:25.250
OK.

1315
01:41:30.380 --> 01:41:31.631
I got it!

1316
01:41:33.842 --> 01:41:35.760
I got you! I got you!

1317
01:42:05.290 --> 01:42:06.875
There's no forward!

1318
01:42:09.878 --> 01:42:12.088
It's not forward, it's down!

1319
01:42:13.048 --> 01:42:17.594
All this water has to go out somewhere.
Otherwise, it'd be filled up.

1320
01:42:27.937 --> 01:42:29.939
Help me turn this wheel!

1321
01:43:03.556 --> 01:43:05.100
The water's going down.

1322
01:43:55.191 --> 01:43:56.901
It is... Em.

1323
01:43:58.027 --> 01:44:00.029
Em. Em.

1324
01:44:06.202 --> 01:44:07.203
Ben!

1325
01:44:08.121 --> 01:44:12.417
Dad! We found it!

1326
01:44:12.792 --> 01:44:16.379
- Thomas was right!
- No, you were right!

1327
01:44:21.718 --> 01:44:24.971
Sorry I smeared your
great-great granddaddy's good name.

1328
01:44:25.054 --> 01:44:27.640
Seemed like the only way
to get you in on the hunt.

1329
01:44:27.724 --> 01:44:32.479
But this was a chance for the Wilkinson
family to make its mark on history,

1330
01:44:32.562 --> 01:44:36.483
to find the City of Gold,
to be remembered.

1331
01:45:07.263 --> 01:45:10.600
What happened to you?
Your father was worried sick about you.

1332
01:45:10.683 --> 01:45:13.061
She was frantic. She was frantic.

1333
01:45:14.062 --> 01:45:16.940
Dad, coming through,
did you happen to see...?

1334
01:45:17.524 --> 01:45:21.444
Stop it. Coming through, did you see
any branches that could lead out?

1335
01:45:21.528 --> 01:45:25.532
No, it's all blocked. You can't even
get back to the big, round stone door.

1336
01:45:26.032 --> 01:45:27.575
Where's your mother going?

1337
01:45:30.620 --> 01:45:33.498
Sweetheart. Sweetheart.
Have a look at this.

1338
01:45:33.581 --> 01:45:34.666
- What?
- Look.

1339
01:45:34.749 --> 01:45:37.126
This is gonna unlock
the Olmec language.

1340
01:45:37.210 --> 01:45:40.838
It's gonna give us incredible
insight into pre-Columbian history.

1341
01:45:44.634 --> 01:45:47.262
- You happy?
- Oh, yeah.

1342
01:45:48.221 --> 01:45:51.224
- Ben! Look at this! Look!
- Oh, yeah.

1343
01:45:51.766 --> 01:45:54.602
That's where they slit the throat,
cut the heart out.

1344
01:46:11.995 --> 01:46:14.706
- What was that?
- Listen.

1345
01:46:41.149 --> 01:46:44.777
I tried to find a way out.
All those portals are blocked off!

1346
01:46:44.861 --> 01:46:48.364
I'm telling you, all this water
goes out somewhere. We'll find it.

1347
01:46:55.872 --> 01:46:57.749
Ben, there's a current!

1348
01:46:58.207 --> 01:47:01.252
Follow it!
There's got to be a central drain!

1349
01:47:01.336 --> 01:47:03.421
It's under us. Right here!

1350
01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:13.681
Come on!

1351
01:47:15.099 --> 01:47:17.101
Let's go! Get in there!

1352
01:47:24.150 --> 01:47:26.235
The water's rising too fast!

1353
01:47:26.319 --> 01:47:29.072
Let's get that door open
so we don't all drown!

1354
01:47:45.797 --> 01:47:48.966
Ben, it slopes down!
It's a drainage tunnel.

1355
01:47:49.509 --> 01:47:51.761
It fills with water
when you open the door!

1356
01:47:51.844 --> 01:47:54.972
We need to find something
to stick under it to keep it open!

1357
01:47:55.056 --> 01:47:58.059
No, if it's open,
this tunnel will stay flooded.

1358
01:47:58.142 --> 01:48:00.853
We've got to get to the other side
and close the door.

1359
01:48:00.937 --> 01:48:02.647
Patrick, Emily, go!

1360
01:48:08.027 --> 01:48:09.112
- No.
- No!

1361
01:48:11.656 --> 01:48:14.492
Mitch, we got to be
on the other side of that door!

1362
01:48:15.034 --> 01:48:16.828
Nobody leaves unless I say so.

1363
01:48:18.287 --> 01:48:20.873
That door is not gonna stay open
by itself.

1364
01:48:20.957 --> 01:48:23.209
We both know what has to happen here.

1365
01:48:23.710 --> 01:48:27.130
One of us keeps the door open
and stays behind.

1366
01:48:29.090 --> 01:48:30.174
I vote Mitch.

1367
01:48:31.259 --> 01:48:32.802
This isn't a democracy.

1368
01:48:37.807 --> 01:48:41.811
Stop! I'll stay!
I'm staying. Look. Look!

1369
01:48:42.729 --> 01:48:45.231
See? I'm right here! I'm staying!

1370
01:48:45.314 --> 01:48:48.025
I'll tell everybody
how this is going to go.

1371
01:48:48.109 --> 01:48:52.363
You and me are going to open that door.
Anybody tries to leave before me,

1372
01:48:52.447 --> 01:48:54.824
I drop the door,
we start this all over again!

1373
01:48:54.907 --> 01:48:58.828
Try any funny business, I guarantee you
people are going to get hurt!

1374
01:49:00.705 --> 01:49:04.208
I won't! You have my word.
Just let her go.

1375
01:49:08.254 --> 01:49:10.882
Ben, no, we're not leaving without you.

1376
01:49:12.842 --> 01:49:13.843
Abigail.

1377
01:49:17.972 --> 01:49:21.684
You make my parents leave.
You make my parents leave.

1378
01:49:31.027 --> 01:49:32.320
- No!
- Let's go!

1379
01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:36.783
Let's go, please! Patrick, Emily,
he's trying to save our lives.

1380
01:49:37.533 --> 01:49:39.160
Please, come on.

1381
01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:42.330
Push, Ben!

1382
01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:47.919
The current's too strong!

1383
01:49:51.172 --> 01:49:53.382
- I'm ready!
- It's all yours!

1384
01:50:16.405 --> 01:50:17.573
Mom!

1385
01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:20.409
Hang om

1386
01:50:23.246 --> 01:50:24.497
Hold your breath!

1387
01:50:36.175 --> 01:50:37.927
We got to get Ben out of there!

1388
01:50:40.930 --> 01:50:45.226
If I'm stuck in the door,
it stays open,

1389
01:50:45.309 --> 01:50:48.229
both rooms fill up, and we all drown!

1390
01:50:48.312 --> 01:50:52.441
- Open the door! I'll get you out!
- The current's too strong!

1391
01:50:52.525 --> 01:50:55.027
I open the door,
you'll be washed down!

1392
01:50:55.111 --> 01:50:56.487
I'll get you out!

1393
01:50:56.571 --> 01:51:00.908
I found the City of Gold! I found it!

1394
01:51:00.992 --> 01:51:02.994
And no one will ever know?

1395
01:51:03.077 --> 01:51:07.290
We can figure this out!
We can all get out!

1396
01:51:07.373 --> 01:51:10.918
It's not a puzzle!
No more puzzles, Ben!

1397
01:51:11.002 --> 01:51:14.171
We're all going to die,
or it could just be me!

1398
01:51:15.006 --> 01:51:18.467
- Tell them I found it!
- Don't quit!

1399
01:52:02.595 --> 01:52:03.721
Thank you.

1400
01:52:21.238 --> 01:52:25.201
- We haven't officially met. I'm Riley.
- Oh, hi.

1401
01:52:31.457 --> 01:52:34.043
Sir! It's for you.

1402
01:52:35.336 --> 01:52:36.337
Sadusky.

1403
01:52:37.254 --> 01:52:40.049
- I have my proof.
- Ben!

1404
01:52:40.466 --> 01:52:44.303
We were just talking about you.
Ready to turn yourself in?

1405
01:52:44.387 --> 01:52:48.057
Not quite.
We found the City of Gold.

1406
01:52:48.140 --> 01:52:50.935
Doesn't matter.
You still committed a federal crime.

1407
01:53:11.414 --> 01:53:14.041
Stop. Stop it.

1408
01:53:15.126 --> 01:53:17.461
- Mr President?
- Craig, give us a minute.

1409
01:53:17.545 --> 01:53:21.298
Sir, for your information,
this is the man who kidnapped you.

1410
01:53:21.382 --> 01:53:24.135
As I recall, we were
exploring a hidden tunnel,

1411
01:53:24.218 --> 01:53:27.763
and a door closed accidentally,
and this man saved my life.

1412
01:53:28.097 --> 01:53:29.306
Yes, sir.

1413
01:53:31.517 --> 01:53:33.269
- Gates.
- Sir.

1414
01:53:34.353 --> 01:53:38.899
For the record, after centuries
of exploration, on this day,

1415
01:53:38.983 --> 01:53:42.528
you have brought honour
to your country and your family.

1416
01:53:44.071 --> 01:53:46.991
You've done this country
a great service. I thank you.

1417
01:53:47.533 --> 01:53:50.202
- Thank you.
- Craig.

1418
01:53:51.537 --> 01:53:55.791
I thought you might want to
take a look at tomorrow's headlines.

1419
01:53:57.376 --> 01:53:58.377
Tomorrow?

1420
01:54:06.594 --> 01:54:07.845
Thank you, sir.

1421
01:54:08.804 --> 01:54:11.265
All of you, along with
Emily and Patrick Gates

1422
01:54:11.348 --> 01:54:13.476
will get credit for this discovery.

1423
01:54:20.608 --> 01:54:22.985
And Mitch Wilkinson, sir.

1424
01:54:23.861 --> 01:54:27.698
- Is that right?
- It's true, sir.

1425
01:54:29.325 --> 01:54:32.328
Ben, I am curious
about that favour I asked you.

1426
01:54:33.829 --> 01:54:36.248
Any report regarding
what's on page 47?

1427
01:54:36.332 --> 01:54:38.542
I believe I can help with that, sir.

1428
01:54:38.626 --> 01:54:41.837
- So it's good.
- Life-altering, sir.

1429
01:54:45.508 --> 01:54:49.136
What's on page 47?
Are you talking about the Book?

1430
01:54:52.348 --> 01:54:53.516
What book?

1431
01:54:55.059 --> 01:54:59.105
Please, be very careful with that.
Is that distilled water you're using?

1432
01:54:59.188 --> 01:55:01.440
- Yes.
- Have you catalogued all of this?

1433
01:55:01.524 --> 01:55:02.900
- No, ma'am.
- You haven't?

1434
01:55:02.983 --> 01:55:06.028
Excuse me? Excuse me, sir?
Are you cataloguing this?

1435
01:55:06.112 --> 01:55:09.406
You should've been there
when we picked out our first couch.

1436
01:55:13.369 --> 01:55:14.787
Excuse me.

1437
01:55:14.870 --> 01:55:18.791
Hey, you're that guy...
The treasure hunter guy, right?

1438
01:55:18.874 --> 01:55:22.670
No, actually, the guy you're thinking of
is somewhere over there.

1439
01:55:22.753 --> 01:55:27.216
No. You're him. Riley Poole.
I recognise you from your book.

1440
01:55:27.883 --> 01:55:30.928
- Will you sign it?
- OK.

1441
01:55:40.187 --> 01:55:41.188
Thank you.

1442
01:55:42.523 --> 01:55:45.734
So the tea tables...

1443
01:55:46.735 --> 01:55:50.489
Yes, I'm going to have the movers
bring them to you next week.

1444
01:55:51.448 --> 01:55:53.409
I was going to say
you can keep them.

1445
01:55:54.243 --> 01:55:58.372
And maybe you could...

1446
01:55:58.455 --> 01:56:00.749
...come and move back in with me.

1447
01:56:01.917 --> 01:56:04.712
- No. You used the word "so."
- So?

1448
01:56:04.795 --> 01:56:07.214
So, when you say "so,"
it means you're angry.

1449
01:56:07.298 --> 01:56:11.260
Sometimes.
And then sometimes it doesn't.

1450
01:56:11.343 --> 01:56:13.679
It's sort of like a puzzle.

1451
01:56:15.514 --> 01:56:19.185
And you're so good at puzzles.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

1452
01:56:21.729 --> 01:56:22.938
So...

1453
01:57:09.693 --> 01:57:11.320
I love this car.

1454
02:04:07.478 --> 02:04:09.479
English
