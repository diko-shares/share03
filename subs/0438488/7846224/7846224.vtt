1
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.040
Marcus.

2
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.180
How are you?

3
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.380
It's been an hour.

4
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.910
I thought I'd try...
one last time.

5
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.700
You should have stayed
in San Francisco, Dr. Kogan.

6
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.460
By signing this consent form,
you'll be donating your body to a noble cause.

7
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.040
You'd...
have a second chance...

8
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.410
through my research
to live again.

9
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.380
You know what I did.

10
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.960
My brother and two cops
are dead because of me.

11
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.650
I'm not lookin'
for a second chance.

12
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.210
But I'm not the only one
with a death sentence, am I?

13
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.160
Do you think I'm gonna kill
your cancer this permanent?

14
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.570
I'm not worried
about myself.

15
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.440
I'm worried about
the future of the human race.

16
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.780
I'll sell it to you.

17
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.220
For what?

18
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.220
A kiss.

19
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.470
So that's what
death tastes like.

20
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.160
You are doing something
very noble.

21
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.960
I'm guilty. Just cut me up
until there's nothing left.

22
00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.820
That I walk through the valley
of the Shadow of Death.

23
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.840
I will fear no evil.

24
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.440
For thou art with me,

25
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.650
thy rod and my staff,
they comfort me.

26
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.300
Do you have
any last words?

27
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:23.640
<i>Bag Art, this is Black Hawk Six. Result in outer
Skynet target. TTO 11 seconds, taken close.</i>

28
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.190
- Come on, come on!
- Move, move!

29
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.080
<i>Connor is on the ground.</i>

30
00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.020
This mission
is a quick in-and-out.

31
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.850
Command teams the information on those
computers should be at the highest priority.

32
00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.170
Connor, there's no sign
of the machines. They're gone.

33
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:03.940
We too quiet. It's almost like
they were waiting for us.

34
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:29.650
What the hell's that smell, man?
Whoa! You're seeing this?

35
00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:59.450
Olson. Objective located.
There's something else you'd have to see.

36
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.590
We got what we came for, Barbaros.
The clock's ticking.

37
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:24.320
Spread out, secure the perimeter.
I got a big gap over here.

38
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.520
Why didn't we know
about this?

39
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.200
Sir, I think this is what Command's
looking for. I'm in their source code.

40
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.770
These people are being taken
up north to San Francisco.

41
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.770
Some sort of R&D project,
for a new Terminator.

42
00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:39.040
Send it to Command.

43
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.910
It's uploading,
I need two minutes.

44
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:43.280
Wait, wait, wait.
Go back. Go back!

45
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.170
Stop!

46
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.110
- T-800.
- A new Terminator.

47
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:55.720
Thought you said
it would be...

48
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.820
It's worse.

49
00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.730
Connor, get your nose out of that.
None of your business.

50
00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:00.830
You're not
leading this mission.

51
00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.220
Alright, let's cut these
sorry bastards loose. Come on, let's go!

52
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.820
- Kirk, come in.
- What's that?

53
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.050
Connor,
get your ass top-side.

54
00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.130
Remind those men
they need to answer me on the radio,

55
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:14.230
even if they're dead.

56
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:29.650
<i>Connor,
get those men to respond.</i>

57
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.650
Olson,
something's wrong up here.

58
00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.330
<i>Top-side, come in!</i>

59
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.040
Help out enemy aircraft,
I'm in pursuit.

60
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:58.350
There are human prisoners
aboard there. Get after 'em!

61
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.160
Pay to transpond the plane.
Connor, we're joining you, top--

62
00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.970
<i>Bravo Ten, Bravo Ten.
Do you copy? Over.</i>

63
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:09.050
<i>Eagle White to Bravo Ten.
Bravo Ten, do you copy? Over.</i>

64
00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.310
<i>Bravo Ten, Bravo Ten,
do you copy? Over.</i>

65
00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:22.010
<i>- Here.
- Bravo Ten, identify. Over.</i>

66
00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.840
Connor!

67
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.200
<i>We'll send units
to the extraction point.</i>

68
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.200
<i>How many survivors are outside?
Over.</i>

69
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.860
One.

70
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.010
<i>Copy.</i>

71
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.740
Return to base, sir?

72
00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:46.410
- RGB?
- Negative. Take me to Command.

73
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.880
Command!

74
00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.980
Roger, re-routing.

75
00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:14.370
Request has been denied.
Command doesn't want to give up their position.

76
00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:16.900
- Radio cogs, over.
- Are they down there?

77
00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.900
Request
has been denied, sir.

78
00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.590
Need to go home.
It's straight from the top.

79
00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.100
You open up that ramp!

80
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:30.590
And you tell them...
I need divers for a log-in.

81
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:36.380
- Now!
- This is crazy.

82
00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:09.800
John Connor,
prophesied leader of the Resistance.

83
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.110
Soldier, you put every man
and woman in this sub

84
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.110
in jeopardy with
your little frogman stunt.

85
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.930
- What the hell are you doing here?
- What did we find down there?

86
00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:21.140
You'll be pleased down
the need-to-know basis.

87
00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:25.640
<i>Well, I need to know, because my men
died down in that hole.</i>

88
00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.520
What did we find
down there?

89
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.670
We found the solution,
Connor,

90
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:33.110
that can end this war,
once and for all.

91
00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:39.650
We know the machines use short-wave
transmitters to communicate.

92
00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:44.820
Our intel has located a hidden signal
under the primary channel.

93
00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:48.820
It allows for direct control
on the machines.

94
00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:53.650
Skynet's a machine, and like all machines,
it has an off-switch.

95
00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.840
- Does it work?
- Will it work? Yes.

96
00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.730
Have we field-tested it?
No.

97
00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.780
Give it to me.

98
00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.610
I'll do it.

99
00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:07.850
I'll test it.

100
00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:13.840
Connor, you can stay Comm unit.
Have a nice one record.

101
00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.700
Alright.

102
00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:18.240
Alright.

103
00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.620
Leave Connor top-side.
Prepare for lock-out.

104
00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:29.220
Connor,
we do this right...

105
00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.520
The war is over.

106
00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.630
Remind our offensive
in 4 days.

107
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:40.160
Connor...

108
00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.740
These are the codes
for the signal.

109
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:46.600
- Good luck.
- Why four days?

110
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.640
A kill list was intercepted
from Skynet.

111
00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.650
It says everyone in this room
will be dead by week's end.

112
00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:54.810
You are number two
on the list.

113
00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:59.520
- Well, who's number one?
- I don't know.

114
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.580
A civilian.
Kyle Reese.

115
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:44.350
Barnes...

116
00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:50.680
My brother...
He didn't make it, did he?

117
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:42.500
<i>This is tape number 28.
It's Sarah Connor to my son, John.</i>

118
00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:46.530
<i>What's most difficult for me
is trying to decide what to tell you</i>

119
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:47.760
<i>and what not to.</i>

120
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.890
<i>Should I tell you
about your father?</i>

121
00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:54.230
<i>Will it affect your decision to send
him back in time to protect me,</i>

122
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:56.210
<i>knowing that
he is your father?</i>

123
00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.540
<i>And he'll be younger than you,
only a teenager,when you meet him.</i>

124
00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.570
<i>Kyle. Person could go crazy
thinking about this.</i>

125
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:06.340
<i>But if you don't send Kyle,
you can never be</i>

126
00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.220
<i>and Skynet will win the war.</i>

127
00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.270
Want to talk about it?

128
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.210
Kyle is out there
somewhere alone

129
00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:20.980
and Skynet
is hunting him.

130
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:23.830
What about the signal?

131
00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.190
What do you think?

132
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:37.980
- If it works, it's incredible.
- Yeah.

133
00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.310
- We have to be careful.
- I agree.

134
00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.340
- But we have to try.
- Okay.

135
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:47.870
Alright then, start with something small,
something more familiar with.

136
00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:54.190
We should try to capture a Hydrobot,
bring it in for testing.

137
00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:59.290
What is it, John?

138
00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.860
Kill Kyle Reese,
reset the future.

139
00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:07.830
No John Connor.

140
00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:33.730
Come with me
if you want to live.

141
00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:40.010
What is that?

142
00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:43.330
She doesn't talk,
but you need to start.

143
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:46.110
Where did you
get that jacket?

144
00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:48.140
The other guy
didn't need it.

145
00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:52.600
You see that red?
It stands for blood.

146
00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.950
<i>It's a symbol of the Resistance.
You're obviously not a Resistance fighter,</i>

147
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.950
so take it off!

148
00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:04.570
You oint a gun at someone,
you better be ready to pull the trigger.

149
00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.710
I'm going to ask you
one more time.

150
00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.510
- What the hell was that thing?
- A Terminator.

151
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:17.690
T-600.

152
00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.360
What day is it?

153
00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.570
What year?

154
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:31.340
2018.

155
00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:34.620
What happened here?

156
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:39.450
Judgement Day happened.

157
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:44.650
I gotta get outta here.

158
00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:47.870
You can't go on foot.
Machines will cut you down.

159
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:49.830
You need speed.

160
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:52.050
I need a car.

161
00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:54.110
Look, there's some by
Griffith Observatory.

162
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:56.800
- I don't know now.
- Take me.

163
00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:00.440
Get down!

164
00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:31.160
That was
a Hunter Killer.

165
00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:35.430
Thanks to you,
they know we're here.

166
00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:39.760
What's your name,
kid?

167
00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:43.080
Kyle Reese.

168
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:47.710
Come on.

169
00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:53.130
We burn down the transmitters
so it can't talk to any of its pals

170
00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:55.870
that it can still recieve.

171
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.320
Turn it on!

172
00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.840
You got it?

173
00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.520
Hold it down!
Hold a bit...

174
00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:20.940
Get me a strap.
Holy shit!

175
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.160
- Just hold it tight.
- The signal has to be continuous.

176
00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.230
If there's
any interruption...

177
00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:39.260
Let's rig up
a portable shortwave.

178
00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.350
I need to test it on something larger
in the field.

179
00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:45.510
Destroy this thing.

180
00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:00.350
- So where are the cars?
- You don't want to go out after dark.

181
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:04.260
Hunter Killers have infrared.
Hunt better at night.

182
00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:06.960
We'll all go
tomorrow morning.

183
00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.610
- What is that?
- Two-day old of coyote.

184
00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:19.860
Better than three-day old coyote.

185
00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.670
- Grab it.
- What?

186
00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:40.900
Grab it.

187
00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:52.420
Magic.

188
00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.080
- Got it?
- Yeah.

189
00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:00.980
Thanks.

190
00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.590
- Does this radio work?
- No.

191
00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:14.120
My dad tried to fix it, but...
he could never get it to work.

192
00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:31.930
Hold that.

193
00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:40.400
- Where is everybody?
- They're gone.

194
00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.530
So why are you
still here?

195
00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:46.530
'Cause we're the Resistance.
L.A. branch.

196
00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:49.010
Welcome
to the headquarters.

197
00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.250
Resistant to what?

198
00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:56.400
Machines.
Skynet.

199
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.850
- Just the two of you?
- Yeah.

200
00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:03.310
How come you're not wearing
one of these?

201
00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:06.320
'Cause I haven't
earned mine, yet.

202
00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.940
I hope
he's listening to this.

203
00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:24.630
We've been fighting a long time,
and we've all lost so very much,

204
00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:28.270
so many loved ones gone.
But you are not alone.

205
00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.630
There are pockets of Resistance
all around the planet.

206
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:35.510
We are at the brink...

207
00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:38.310
Do a sea magic trick.

208
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:39.850
Hold that up.

209
00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.670
Press the button.

210
00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:53.380
<i>If we had to finally...
less than 100 meters.</i>

211
00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:59.190
<i>We've had a lot of firepower but the T-600's
are heavy, and slow their primitive design.</i>

212
00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.430
Who is that?

213
00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:03.440
<i>If you can help or no...
then you have one option.</i>

214
00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:07.880
Their motor cortex is partially
exposed to the back of their neck.

215
00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:11.730
<i>A knife to this area will disorientate
their tracking device</i>

216
00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:14.340
<i>but not for long.
Above all, stay alive.</i>

217
00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:20.150
<i>You have no idea how important you are
and how important you will become.</i>

218
00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:23.720
<i>The machines are advancing
even faster than I told you they would.</i>

219
00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:27.660
<i>I've seen it with my own eyes.
They were inventing new Terminators.</i>

220
00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:29.350
<i>New ways of killing us.</i>

221
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:31.990
<i>Skynet is planning
something big.</i>

222
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:35.590
<i>But the Resistance
is planning something bigger.</i>

223
00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.570
This is John Connor.

224
00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:43.910
<i>If you're listening to this,
you are the Resistance.</i>

225
00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:47.940
John Connor.

226
00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:51.510
We gotta find this guy.

227
00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:25.950
So...
You get it working?

228
00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:28.950
- Almost.
- Good.

229
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:31.950
Look, I figure
we head east, right?

230
00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:34.890
We go through the desert, then we can
connect with the Resistance there.

231
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.440
- I'm heading north.
- No. No, no, no, no.

232
00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:43.330
The machines control the whole
Northern Sector upto San Francisco.

233
00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:44.400
That's Skynet's central.

234
00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.180
I have to find someone.

235
00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:48.820
There's a lot that you don't
understand about Skynet, okay?

236
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:50.640
It's just too dangerous
for us to go there.

237
00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.300
What about
the L.A. branch?

238
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:03.760
Come on, man.
We need to get out of L.A.

239
00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:22.960
[ Song: Rooster
Band: Alice in Chains ]

240
00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.880
What is that?

241
00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:30.510
Something my brother
used to listen to.

242
00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:37.290
Star, get out.

243
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.580
Don't look at me
like that, Star.

244
00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:44.440
Get out.
Get out!

245
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.330
You're leaving?
You're gonna leave us?

246
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:54.750
Ah, I get it.

247
00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:59.670
Do you want to know the difference
between us and the machines?

248
00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:03.480
We bury our dead.

249
00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:07.650
But no one is coming
to bury you.

250
00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:19.760
Air attack!

251
00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:23.000
- It's a chopper of a Terminator.
- Go! Drive!

252
00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:34.420
They must have heard
the music.

253
00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:39.440
- Keep the steering.
- I've never driven before.

254
00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:21.920
This thing is pissing me of.

255
00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.460
I'll drive!

256
00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:30.500
We're seeing a lot of
enemy movement in L.A.

257
00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:33.670
Any more people
in the area?

258
00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.580
No one on the ground. Two 8-10s
in the air. Williams and Marhadi.

259
00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:39.650
Send the birds down.

260
00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:42.820
Guide them to a safe area.

261
00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.690
<i>Roger, Coward 6-7
in console.</i>

262
00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:49.530
<i>Ten miles to bring.
Lima-Alpha, 1-2-5-7-9-0-3. Over.</i>

263
00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:52.540
<i>- Copy that.
- Roger, Wild Eagle. Final copy.</i>

264
00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:52.980
Hey, there's someone here.

265
00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:57.170
Get down, now! Move!
Drop your weapons.

266
00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.680
Is there a problem?

267
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:08.480
Hey, we saw
your Resistant sign.

268
00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.230
The old lady put it there,
not me.

269
00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.940
What do you want?

270
00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:14.330
We're looking
for fuel.

271
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:16.730
The dark season's coming.

272
00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:19.430
We only got enough
for ourselves.

273
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:22.950
You point that gun at somebody,
you better be ready to pull the trigger.

274
00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.500
Put your guns down,
everyone.

275
00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:34.600
Look, we just came
to find the Resistance. That's all.

276
00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.440
The Resistance?
What a joke!

277
00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.860
Fighting those machines
is impossible.

278
00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:42.130
We keep our heads down,
they ignore us.

279
00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:44.340
You keep your heads down
and they'll come for you eventually.

280
00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:46.150
We help you
and maybe they will.

281
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:48.260
These people
aren't gonna help you.

282
00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:49.690
Let's go.

283
00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:50.970
You're not going anywhere.

284
00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:53.880
Not until this one
gets something to eat.

285
00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:05.670
Bring me a basket.

286
00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:09.200
Here you go.

287
00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.210
Come on, help yourself!
Eat up.

288
00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.130
Are you alright, son?

289
00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:30.230
It's our food.
Our fuel.

290
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:32.700
It's not your choice
to make!

291
00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.460
Star, Star!

292
00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:16.020
Damn!
You brought them here!

293
00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:27.360
You brought them here.

294
00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:41.540
- Stop, stop!
- Come on, wait.

295
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.210
- Head for the tunnels!
- Truck!

296
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.180
We can't
just run for it.

297
00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.000
Shoot it!

298
00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.480
Go, go, go!

299
00:39:58.050 --> 00:39:59.020
come on!

300
00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:04.320
It didn't work.

301
00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.380
Shit!

302
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:59.830
Throttle Terminators!

303
00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:14.630
Shoot this
son of a bitch!

304
00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.540
Marcus,
turn right up here.

305
00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:47.450
Hold on!

306
00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:59.240
Where is the other one?

307
00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:25.130
Come on!

308
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:26.820
Star,
give me the gun.

309
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:43.580
Hang on!

310
00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:53.660
- Drop the ball!
- Uh, alright.

311
00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:27.060
Kyle!

312
00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:34.890
Marcus! Marcus!

313
00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:41.440
<i>I got my eyes on
two targets.</i>

314
00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:46.340
We've got two bogeys at 270є. They've never
come this deep before. They're looking for something.

315
00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:55.320
<i>H.K. is down.</i>

316
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:14.960
<i>We've got an "H.K" porching our six.
Come over by. Breaking off.</i>

317
00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:23.910
Evasive maneuvers
now!

318
00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:40.000
It's got a lock on you.
Break off.

319
00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:45.110
<i>- Eject, Williams, eject!
- Punching out.</i>

320
00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:06.290
There's your transport,
headed northwest,

321
00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:09.680
bearing 2-8-9
towards San Francisco.

322
00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:13.840
First,
test the signal.

323
00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:16.250
And pray it works.

324
00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:14.360
You okay?

325
00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:17.740
Get my knife.
It's in my left boot.

326
00:47:25.210 --> 00:47:28.030
- What's your name?
- Blair Williams.

327
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:31.940
What's yours?

328
00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:38.400
Name's Marcus.

329
00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.270
You can let me down now,
Marcus.

330
00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:51.600
- That thing, where'd it go?
- The transport?

331
00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:55.010
Skynet.
Where the hell are you going?

332
00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:56.320
After it.

333
00:47:57.310 --> 00:48:02.050
Hate to break it to you but, if you've got
friends on that thing. They're good as dead.

334
00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:04.690
The same with you
if you keep walking in that direction.

335
00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:07.150
They've only been dead a while
and I am getting used to it.

336
00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:09.750
Why don't you come with me
to my base?

337
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:11.990
Connor might know why.

338
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:17.940
Listen, if you've got a problem
with the machines,

339
00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:20.060
he's definitely the guy
you wanna talk to.

340
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:25.120
- How far is your base?
- It should be 1 or 2 days hike.

341
00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:27.770
It's that way.

342
00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:55.220
What are you saying?
Speak English!

343
00:48:55.220 --> 00:49:00.560
I was telling him...
It is not true,

344
00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:03.710
- the part of machines killing us.
- They're gonna kill us.

345
00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:05.240
They're gonna kill everyone.

346
00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:08.330
We are in a cattle cart, or we're on
our way to the slaughterhouse.

347
00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:10.150
Calm down.

348
00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:11.610
You're not helping.

349
00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:14.750
The most important thing
that we can do right now

350
00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.390
is stay alive.

351
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:18.720
In here and in here.

352
00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:22.510
Alright?
Just stay alive.

353
00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:39.500
Over there.

354
00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:50.200
Find something that can burn.
We'll be at my base tomorrow.

355
00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:55.000
Are you hurt?

356
00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:58.440
I'm fine.

357
00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:19.450
What you got there?

358
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:24.160
Just some antibiotics.

359
00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:27.270
Antibiotics are hard
to come by these days.

360
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:30.670
Listen, I don't have much, but...
you're welcome to whatever you need.

361
00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:34.090
We've been watching you.

362
00:50:35.770 --> 00:50:37.040
Looking for this?

363
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:41.610
Come on, guys.
Machines are the enemy.

364
00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:43.340
We're on the same side.

365
00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:46.660
No, no. See, I've got
a couple of friends on my side.

366
00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:48.920
Maybe they can carry you home...

367
00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:50.640
when I'm done with you.

368
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:55.370
You might want
a chamber around.

369
00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:38.370
Kill me,
you ain't gonna win this war.

370
00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:46.090
Oh, God!

371
00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:33.890
I'm a little cold.

372
00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:43.730
Relax.

373
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:49.110
I just want
some body heat.

374
00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:57.440
You have
a strong heart.

375
00:52:59.670 --> 00:53:02.180
God,
I love that sound.

376
00:53:08.830 --> 00:53:09.860
Thank you...

377
00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:12.760
for saving me
back there.

378
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:16.640
I don't meet a lot
of good guys these days.

379
00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:20.450
I'm not a good guy.

380
00:53:26.830 --> 00:53:28.330
You are.

381
00:53:28.330 --> 00:53:31.160
You just don't know it, yet.

382
00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:43.090
Do you think people
deserve a second chance?

383
00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:49.350
Yeah.
I do.

384
00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.850
This is it.
Skynet's Valley of Death.

385
00:53:55.850 --> 00:53:58.000
We've never been
this deep before.

386
00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:00.430
We've got to be sure
this thing works in their territory.

387
00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:02.530
On the bigger machines.

388
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:15.210
That will bring them in.

389
00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:33.490
H.K.
They're coming.

390
00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:56.600
Turn it up!

391
00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:21.750
It works, man.
The signal works.

392
00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.250
It's beautiful!

393
00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:37.290
<i>- Commander Ashdown.
- Connor, tell me it works.</i>

394
00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:40.430
It works. That is affirmative.
The signal works.

395
00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:41.900
Good.

396
00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:44.810
The attack commences tomorrow
at 0400, worldwide.

397
00:55:44.810 --> 00:55:47.830
<i>Your unit will be at the board
of a bombing in Skynet Central.</i>

398
00:55:47.830 --> 00:55:50.640
What is the extraction plan
for the prisoners?

399
00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:53.140
<i>Extraction plan?
There is no extraction plan.</i>

400
00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:54.650
We're gonna level the place.

401
00:55:55.610 --> 00:56:00.750
Negative, I told you. Skynet Central
is filled with human prisoners.

402
00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:04.070
This is war, Connor.

403
00:56:04.070 --> 00:56:06.460
Leadership has its cost.
You, above all, should know that.

404
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:16.030
Ashdown, come in! Ashdown, Connor.
Ashdown, Con... Damn him!

405
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:17.480
- Blair.
- What?

406
00:57:21.330 --> 00:57:24.120
This is us.
The mines are magnetic.

407
00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:26.830
If we head due west
at this point of entry, we're good.

408
00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:31.450
I'll go first.

409
00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:02.850
Let's go, Marcus.
I'm starving.

410
00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:26.100
<i>This is the beginning
of something wonderful.</i>

411
00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:28.860
The son of a bitch is here.

412
00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:31.510
What do we've got here?
He stepped on a landmine.

413
00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:35.210
- Start a large four IV. Keep it open.
- Patient needs more morphine.

414
00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:37.890
- What's his name?
- Marcus.

415
00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:42.650
- He's got a prosthetic limb?
- What?

416
00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:46.900
Okay, pulse is dead.
Let's see what we've got here.

417
00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:54.140
Barnes...

418
00:59:00.350 --> 00:59:02.920
The Devil's hands
have been busy.

419
00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:07.780
- What is it?
- It's real flesh and blood.

420
00:59:07.790 --> 00:59:09.540
Though it seems
to heal his off quickly.

421
00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:14.410
The heart is human,
but very powerful.

422
00:59:14.410 --> 00:59:17.220
The brain too,
but with a chip interface.

423
00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:19.980
It has a hybrid nervous system.

424
00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:22.520
One human cortex. ...

425
00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:25.560
- One machine.
- What the hell would have they done?

426
00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:28.370
Who built you?

427
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:33.580
My name is
Marcus Wright.

428
00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:35.510
You think
you're human?

429
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:37.410
I am human.

430
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.410
No!

431
01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:14.270
Where were you
manufactured?

432
01:00:14.310 --> 01:00:20.250
I was born...
August 22nd, 1975.

433
01:00:32.410 --> 01:00:33.960
I know you.

434
01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.230
I heard your voice
on the radio.

435
01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:44.960
- You're John Connor.
- Of course you know me. You were sent here to kill me.

436
01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:47.580
Kill the leadership.

437
01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:49.490
I don't know
what you're talking about.

438
01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:51.120
Then why are you here?

439
01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:53.250
Blair said you could help me
find who I'm looking for.

440
01:00:57.740 --> 01:00:59.440
Now let me down.

441
01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:03.840
If I let you down...
you'll kill everyone in this room.

442
01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:06.790
Just you, Connor.

443
01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:09.070
'Cause I ain't
give a shit about you.

444
01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:11.730
I didn't even know your name
until two days ago.

445
01:01:11.730 --> 01:01:12.600
No?

446
01:01:16.990 --> 01:01:20.710
You and me...
We've been at war,

447
01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:24.140
since before
either of us even existed.

448
01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:29.200
You tried killing my mother,
Sarah Connor.

449
01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:33.550
You killed my father,
Kyle Reese.

450
01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:37.200
You will not
kill me.

451
01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:43.870
Kyle Reese is on a transporter,
heading to Skynet.

452
01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:46.630
If I wanted
to kill him,

453
01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:50.000
I would have done it
in L.A.

454
01:01:56.370 --> 01:01:57.750
Where did you
find that thing?

455
01:01:57.750 --> 01:02:00.680
You sent Mariah and me
to provide cover for some civilians.

456
01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:01.700
He was
one of them.

457
01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:03.660
Was there
a teenage boy?

458
01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:07.150
I honestly don't know.
They were taking him to a transport.

459
01:02:07.150 --> 01:02:11.080
- He was the only one left.
- Not he, Blair. It.

460
01:02:11.110 --> 01:02:13.050
<i>It was the only one left.
Don't be naпve.</i>

461
01:02:14.290 --> 01:02:15.780
It saved my life.

462
01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:20.850
Kate, what's gonna
happen to him?

463
01:02:22.310 --> 01:02:23.950
Disassembled.

464
01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:25.480
You mean killed?

465
01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:27.950
It may have information
on Skynet.

466
01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:31.950
I know
he's not the enemy.

467
01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:34.730
I've been shot at by the enemy.
That's not him.

468
01:02:34.730 --> 01:02:38.840
That machine saved you only
to gain access to kill all of us.

469
01:03:20.110 --> 01:03:21.740
We're gonna be okay.
Don't worry.

470
01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:40.730
For my brother.

471
01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:01.600
Connor wants
to see you.

472
01:04:02.410 --> 01:04:03.590
What for?

473
01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:06.240
Like he's going to tell me,
Barnes.

474
01:04:08.430 --> 01:04:10.660
Let me see that.

475
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:19.660
- You want me to tell Connor you're not coming?
- No.

476
01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:26.430
Watch him.

477
01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:56.300
<i>I told you everything
I know, John.</i>

478
01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:59.600
<i>Skynet is ruthless
and unpredictable.</i>

479
01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:03.090
<i>They will use the best part of you
against yourself,</i>

480
01:05:03.090 --> 01:05:06.940
<i>and they will have methods
I can't imagine or predict.</i>

481
01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:09.220
<i>That I can't
help you with.</i>

482
01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:14.840
<i>And when you're unsure,
which just always follow your heart, John.</i>

483
01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:17.480
<i>I love you.
Goodbye.</i>

484
01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:23.090
There's nothing on the tapes
about machines with organs.

485
01:05:23.130 --> 01:05:24.370
That thing in there...

486
01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.640
I thought I knew
our enemy.

487
01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:30.890
But that thing...

488
01:05:30.890 --> 01:05:33.290
That makes me feel like
I know nothing.

489
01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:38.140
I looked in its eyes,
and it believes,

490
01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:40.960
absolutely believes,
that it is human.

491
01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:44.590
It believes in everything
that it says,

492
01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:49.300
and it is telling me
that Kyle Reese is in Skynet.

493
01:05:51.050 --> 01:05:52.150
If that is true...

494
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:57.290
The Command is about to bomb my
father and the rest of those prisoners

495
01:05:57.290 --> 01:06:00.620
and I cannot stop them.

496
01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:09.340
Thank you.

497
01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:11.290
Come in!

498
01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:16.000
Barnes.
What about Blair?

499
01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:53.710
- She made her choice.
- Get down!

500
01:07:06.610 --> 01:07:08.050
Let's move.

501
01:07:21.030 --> 01:07:22.520
- Put a light out there.
- We're back in the minefield.

502
01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:23.950
I have a plan.

503
01:07:47.690 --> 01:07:49.700
- Blair, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay!

504
01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:51.960
- Get your team back!
- There they are!

505
01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:54.360
Run! God!

506
01:08:06.110 --> 01:08:07.250
Now what?

507
01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:09.930
M-My plan stopped
at the jeep.

508
01:08:20.970 --> 01:08:23.570
I'll draw the fire.
You take out the light.

509
01:08:42.830 --> 01:08:45.220
Keep your head down!
Go, go, go, go!

510
01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:55.320
Come on!

511
01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:02.820
- You alright?
- Let's get you out of here.

512
01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:10.230
There they are!

513
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:25.210
<i>Alligator, this is Cockpit 5-1,
we have eyes on the machine.</i>

514
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.770
Take my gun!

515
01:11:14.950 --> 01:11:16.540
<i>Check the river.</i>

516
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:33.510
You see him?

517
01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:02.680
I'm going down!

518
01:12:10.810 --> 01:12:12.360
Fall!

519
01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:16.630
Give me your hand!
Give me your hand!

520
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:07.340
I know what you are,
even if you don't.

521
01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:08.280
Enough!

522
01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:10.900
That gun ain't
gonna stop shit!

523
01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:13.850
Nobody shot you in the heart, and I see
that thing beating a mile a minute.

524
01:13:13.850 --> 01:13:15.000
Kyle Reese...

525
01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.150
He's in Skynet.
You do that, he's dead.

526
01:13:19.930 --> 01:13:21.210
I can get you in.

527
01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:23.930
How?

528
01:13:30.730 --> 01:13:32.250
Look at me.

529
01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:36.350
That's why
I don't trust you.

530
01:13:38.250 --> 01:13:40.430
I'm your only hope
you have.

531
01:13:44.330 --> 01:13:46.760
I need to find
who did this to me.

532
01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:49.590
So do you.

533
01:13:58.940 --> 01:14:00.680
Make your choice.

534
01:14:02.150 --> 01:14:04.250
You kept being...

535
01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:10.390
You tell me
where I can find Kyle Reese.

536
01:14:12.610 --> 01:14:16.270
- Yeah?
- I will.

537
01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:22.990
Contact me on that.

538
01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:26.170
Let me know
he's still alive.

539
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:35.200
- What are you?
- I don't know.

540
01:14:43.930 --> 01:14:44.960
Hey,
he's over here.

541
01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:52.150
You alright?
Any sign of him?

542
01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:54.870
He's gone.

543
01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:04.120
What'd you do?

544
01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:08.720
How's your leg?

545
01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:19.160
I'll live.

546
01:15:19.170 --> 01:15:21.990
Let me go!

547
01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:34.220
Connor.
Command for you.

548
01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:38.380
- This is Connor.
- Connor,are your men ready?

549
01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:40.870
<i>Negative.
Nobody is ready.</i>

550
01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:42.300
We are not,
you are not.

551
01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:45.350
We must abort the attack.
The game has changed.

552
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:48.980
What are you talking about?
All our elements are past the release point.

553
01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:50.810
They are in assault position!

554
01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:54.380
Then delay the attack.
At least, delay the attack.

555
01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:57.420
I have a chance to infiltrate Skynet
and rescue those prisoners.

556
01:15:57.420 --> 01:15:58.820
Give me
that opportunity.

557
01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:00.340
No, absolutely not!

558
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:02.220
This is not the time
for a rescue mission!

559
01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:05.230
What you ask for will
undermine the whole operation.

560
01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:07.730
Skynet has Kyle Reese.

561
01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:10.040
And that is his fate.

562
01:16:10.050 --> 01:16:11.970
<i>No, it's our fate.
I have to save him.</i>

563
01:16:11.970 --> 01:16:14.150
He is the key!

564
01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:16.320
The key to the future,
to the past.

565
01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:19.430
Without him,
we lose everything.

566
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:21.110
No!
You stay the course!

567
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:26.290
If we stay the course, we are dead!
We are all dead!

568
01:16:26.290 --> 01:16:28.670
<i>As of this moment,
soldier,</i>

569
01:16:28.670 --> 01:16:30.640
you are relieved
to your command.

570
01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:33.610
You are no longer
a part of this Resistance!

571
01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.090
I didn't catch
that last statement.

572
01:16:48.970 --> 01:16:50.970
This is John Connor.
If you're listening to this...

573
01:16:50.970 --> 01:16:53.150
you are
the Resistance.

574
01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:57.740
<i>Listen carefully.
If we attack tonight,</i>

575
01:16:58.150 --> 01:17:00.170
<i>our humanity is lost.</i>

576
01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:03.250
Command wants us
to fight like machines,

577
01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:05.910
they want us to make
cold, calculated decisions.

578
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:08.100
But we are not
machines.

579
01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:13.560
And if we behave like them,
then what is the point... in winning?

580
01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:18.190
<i>Command is going to ask you
to attack Skynet.</i>

581
01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.190
<i>I am asking you
not to.</i>

582
01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:28.630
If even one bomb
drops on Skynet before sunrise,

583
01:17:28.630 --> 01:17:31.880
our future will be lost.

584
01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:35.250
<i>So, please. Stand down.
Give me the time</i>

585
01:17:35.250 --> 01:17:42.510
<i>to protect our future,
that all of us are fighting for.</i>

586
01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:46.310
This is
John Connor.

587
01:18:10.810 --> 01:18:14.110
What should I tell your men
when they find out you're gone?

588
01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:19.460
I'll be back.

589
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.480
I'm coming for you.

590
01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:01.960
Come on, Marcus.

591
01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:14.900
Okay.

592
01:23:51.650 --> 01:23:54.330
Signal broadcasted
with full thrift, sir.

593
01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:55.430
Good.

594
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:59.170
We have a green light
for the attack.

595
01:23:59.170 --> 01:24:00.680
<i>This is Bakersfield.</i>

596
01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:02.690
<i>That's a no-go
on your last. Out.</i>

597
01:24:02.690 --> 01:24:05.390
<i>Standing down. This is Reno.
Negative on your last.</i>

598
01:24:05.390 --> 01:24:08.320
Eugene, Reno, Bakersfield,
they're all standing down.

599
01:24:08.350 --> 01:24:09.550
They will not attack.

600
01:24:09.550 --> 01:24:11.570
Unless Connor gives the order.

601
01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:42.700
Kyle Reese?
Get to your transport!

602
01:24:42.710 --> 01:24:45.410
Is Kyle Reese here?

603
01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:09.040
<i>Welcome home, Marcus.
We knew you'd be back.</i>

604
01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:12.580
<i>After all,
it was programmed in you.</i>

605
01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:18.020
<i>Oh, and you executed
that programming beautifully.</i>

606
01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:19.620
What am I?

607
01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:22.340
You are
an infiltration prototype.

608
01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:24.220
The only
one of your kind.

609
01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:25.820
We resurrected you.

610
01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:29.830
<i>Advanced CyberDyne's work...
amended it.</i>

611
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:31.120
what is it?

612
01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:35.410
<i>Calculations confirmed the serene code
on this face isn't easiest for you to process.</i>

613
01:25:35.410 --> 01:25:38.520
<i>It can be others
if you wish.</i>

614
01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:45.090
<i>Marcus, what else could you be...
if not machine?</i>

615
01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:46.990
A man.

616
01:25:46.990 --> 01:25:49.780
<i>The human condition
no longer applies to you.</i>

617
01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:52.790
<i>Accept what you
already know...</i>

618
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:55.830
<i>That you were made
to serve a purpose.</i>

619
01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:59.320
<i>To achieve what no another
machine has achieved before.</i>

620
01:26:01.330 --> 01:26:06.710
<i>To infiltrate,find a target,and then
bring that target back home to us.</i>

621
01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:13.180
<i>We've been at war since before
either of us even existed.</i>

622
01:26:13.190 --> 01:26:17.410
<i>You tried killing my mother,
Sarah Connor.</i>

623
01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:22.830
<i>You kill me...You tell me
where I can find Kyle Reese.</i>

624
01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:25.850
<i>Yeah, I will.</i>

625
01:26:33.810 --> 01:26:37.370
Kyle Reese!

626
01:26:45.930 --> 01:26:47.720
You, move!

627
01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:51.840
<i>In times of desperation, people will
believe what they want to believe.</i>

628
01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:56.580
<i>And so, we gave them
what they wanted to believe.</i>

629
01:26:56.580 --> 01:27:02.950
<i>A trick, in the form of a signal,
the Resistance thought would win the war.</i>

630
01:27:02.950 --> 01:27:08.910
<i>And they were right.
It will end this war.</i>

631
01:27:16.810 --> 01:27:18.700
Put the attack to
Skynet's Central back online.

632
01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:21.520
I want our aircraft in the skies,
immediately!

633
01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:26.110
Sir, sir, we got a bogey with a very large
radar signature closing in on our position.

634
01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:39.840
The signal?

635
01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:47.000
We have destroyed
ourselves.

636
01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.210
Skynet tracked our signal.
We led them straight to us.

637
01:28:04.510 --> 01:28:14.230
<i>Our best machines have failed,
time and again, to complete the mission.</i>

638
01:28:14.230 --> 01:28:17.460
<i>So we made you. We created
the perfect infiltration machine.</i>

639
01:28:17.460 --> 01:28:19.850
<i>You, Marcus.</i>

640
01:28:19.850 --> 01:28:23.840
<i>You did what Skynet
has failed to do for so many years.</i>

641
01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:26.980
<i>You killed John Connor.</i>

642
01:29:40.780 --> 01:29:42.690
<i>Don't fight, Marcus.</i>

643
01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:44.800
<i>Remember
what you are.</i>

644
01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:47.600
I know what I am.

645
01:29:59.810 --> 01:30:02.700
I'm better this way.

646
01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:04.720
You will not be given
a second chance.

647
01:30:05.770 --> 01:30:07.770
<i>You cannot save
John Connor.</i>

648
01:30:07.770 --> 01:30:09.870
Watch me.

649
01:30:38.890 --> 01:30:41.240
We got a message
from Connor!

650
01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:43.540
He's in Skynet.
Needs air support.

651
01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:48.460
Let's go!
Scram for the aircraft.

652
01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:54.300
Stop!
Stop, no!

653
01:31:06.660 --> 01:31:08.600
Come on!

654
01:31:29.230 --> 01:31:31.640
- What's your name?
- Kyle Reese.

655
01:31:37.790 --> 01:31:39.000
Stay with me!

656
01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:00.720
Back!

657
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:17.760
Come on, Star,
move!

658
01:32:45.150 --> 01:32:50.010
- T-800s.
- There's so many of them.

659
01:33:10.030 --> 01:33:11.200
Be careful!

660
01:33:14.540 --> 01:33:16.360
What are these?

661
01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:20.080
Fuel cells.
Life source for the T-800.

662
01:33:23.470 --> 01:33:24.850
Nuclear.

663
01:33:24.850 --> 01:33:32.670
Enough to level this place.
Cover us.

664
01:33:38.590 --> 01:33:39.930
You ready?

665
01:34:03.420 --> 01:34:07.390
Run!Come on,
come on! Let's go!

666
01:34:09.890 --> 01:34:11.040
Come here!

667
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:15.520
Come on!

668
01:34:19.570 --> 01:34:21.420
We got to get
to the transport!

669
01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:29.170
- Where are you going?
- I gotta end this.

670
01:34:29.170 --> 01:34:30.720
I'm not gonna
leave you!

671
01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:32.420
You didn't!

672
01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:33.750
Who are you?

673
01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:36.190
John Connor!

674
01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:41.380
Hey, John Connor's
in there.

675
01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:44.280
- Where?
- You show me there.

676
01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:46.730
John Connor's in there!

677
01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:14.700
Come with me!
Connor!

678
01:38:14.700 --> 01:38:16.430
Help!

679
01:38:18.590 --> 01:38:20.440
Connor, it's Kyle!
Help!

680
01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:22.410
You son of a bitch!

681
01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:52.800
Come on!

682
01:39:57.440 --> 01:39:58.900
Come on!

683
01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:19.490
Come on!

684
01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:11.350
Let's get out of here.

685
01:41:29.220 --> 01:41:31.060
John...

686
01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:39.520
We can't make it back to base.
Center's down and they never say so.

687
01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:13.560
How long?

688
01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:22.450
His heart...can't take it.

689
01:43:22.450 --> 01:43:25.980
He's going to be okay.
He's going to be okay, Kate.

690
01:43:25.980 --> 01:43:27.710
Kyle?

691
01:43:40.780 --> 01:43:42.250
Take it...

692
01:44:01.350 --> 01:44:04.130
You earned it.

693
01:44:30.130 --> 01:44:31.790
Kate... Take mine.

694
01:44:31.790 --> 01:44:33.850
Marcus?

695
01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:40.740
Everybody deserves
a second chance.

696
01:44:44.210 --> 01:44:45.860
This is mine.

697
01:45:43.090 --> 01:45:45.210
<i>What is it
that makes us human?</i>

698
01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:49.760
<i>It's not something
you can program.</i>

699
01:45:49.770 --> 01:45:53.520
<i>You can't put it
into a chip.</i>

700
01:45:55.870 --> 01:45:58.110
<i>It's the strength
of the human heart.</i>

701
01:45:58.110 --> 01:46:02.430
<i>The difference
between us and machines.</i>

702
01:46:21.930 --> 01:46:24.180
<i>There is a storm
on the horizon.</i>

703
01:46:24.180 --> 01:46:26.590
<i>A time of hardship
and pain.</i>

704
01:46:26.590 --> 01:46:32.270
<i>This battle has been won,but the
war against the machines raises on.</i>

705
01:46:32.270 --> 01:46:35.250
<i>Skynet's global network
remains strong.</i>

706
01:46:35.250 --> 01:46:37.760
<i>But we will not quit,</i>

707
01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:40.210
<i>until all of it
is destroyed.</i>

708
01:46:40.210 --> 01:46:42.130
<i>This is John Connor.</i>

709
01:46:42.130 --> 01:46:46.270
<i>There is no fate,
but what we make.</i>
