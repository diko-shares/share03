1
00:00:47.126 --> 00:00:49.584
The year is 2980,

2
00:00:49.585 --> 00:00:52.500
and we now know that
death is not the end.

3
00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:55.709
A soul can be extracted
from the recently deceased

4
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.459
and be used to create a
blue liquid called essence.

5
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.417
It can bring a
person back to life

6
00:01:01.418 --> 00:01:04.709
in the form of a
cyborg-human hybrid.

7
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.459
It's an expensive process
used by the rich and powerful.

8
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.917
The rest, they do what
they can to survive.

9
00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:26.625
Malachi Monroe,

10
00:01:26.626 --> 00:01:28.459
you have been charged
with the crime

11
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.542
of interstellar
civil disobedience.

12
00:01:31.543 --> 00:01:32.875
How do you plead?

13
00:01:32.876 --> 00:01:34.667
- I didn't do anything wrong.

14
00:01:34.668 --> 00:01:38.667
- I'm afraid your lack
of honesty and remorse

15
00:01:38.668 --> 00:01:43.542
leaves me no choice but to
find you guilty as charged.

16
00:01:43.543 --> 00:01:45.375
But you have the
wrong-

17
00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:52.209
- Malachi Monroe,

18
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.792
may the gods have mercy

19
00:01:54.793 --> 00:01:57.834
on your soul.

20
00:02:15.793 --> 00:02:18.459
Kip Corman, you
have been charged

21
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.668
with the crime of
interstellar theft.

22
00:02:21.585 --> 00:02:22.750
How do you plead?

23
00:02:22.751 --> 00:02:24.375
- The only thing I'm guilty of

24
00:02:24.376 --> 00:02:26.542
is being a better
scavenger than you.

25
00:02:26.543 --> 00:02:28.792
- Yet here you are
about to be dropped

26
00:02:28.793 --> 00:02:30.917
in the mouth of a Nolgath.

27
00:02:30.918 --> 00:02:34.000
I find you guilty as charged.

28
00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:35.959
- Why don't you
drop the judge act?

29
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.542
You're a murderous leech

30
00:02:37.543 --> 00:02:39.459
that couldn't even find
the Dolstar Crystal,

31
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.542
even though it was practically
sitting in your own backyard.

32
00:02:42.543 --> 00:02:43.959
- It's a shame your daughter

33
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.667
couldn't be here
to see this moment.

34
00:02:46.668 --> 00:02:49.709
When I find her,
and I will find her,

35
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.959
she'll suffer the
same fate as you.

36
00:02:59.293 --> 00:03:00.709
Any last words?

37
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:01.751
- I'll see you soon.

38
00:03:03.835 --> 00:03:05.959
- I will tell everyone
that your final words

39
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.460
were incoherent groveling
and begging for your life.

40
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.835
Goodbye, Kip Corman.

41
00:03:33.751 --> 00:03:35.042
No!

42
00:03:36.543 --> 00:03:39.542
- Give me the helm, sweetie.

43
00:03:39.543 --> 00:03:41.500
You cut that pretty
close, don't you think?

44
00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:43.375
- I barely got this running.

45
00:03:43.376 --> 00:03:45.000
I'll need to finish repairs
when we get to the trading post.

46
00:03:45.001 --> 00:03:47.417
- I got one more
thing I gotta do.

47
00:04:41.751 --> 00:04:43.585
- Alert.
- Quantum circuit unstable.

48
00:04:45.543 --> 00:04:46.418
Taylor.

49
00:04:47.626 --> 00:04:48.585
What are you doing?

50
00:04:50.501 --> 00:04:51.500
- How'd it go?

51
00:04:51.501 --> 00:04:52.501
- Is this salvageable?

52
00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:54.875
- No.

53
00:04:54.876 --> 00:04:55.751
- Dammit.

54
00:04:57.043 --> 00:04:58.959
- Elnora?

55
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.917
- I swear that woman, she gets
a kick outta screwing with me.

56
00:05:00.918 --> 00:05:02.500
- She owns the only trading post

57
00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:04.834
this side of Wantanian Skytrail.

58
00:05:04.835 --> 00:05:05.959
- So?

59
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.584
- She screws everyone over.

60
00:05:07.585 --> 00:05:09.000
- How's the ship
looking? Can we go?

61
00:05:09.001 --> 00:05:10.917
- The light system is
at quarter capacity,

62
00:05:10.918 --> 00:05:13.584
and the hyperdrive
is in rough shape.

63
00:05:13.585 --> 00:05:15.084
- How rough?

64
00:05:15.085 --> 00:05:16.959
- We'll be able to make
one jump, but that's it.

65
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.167
We'll need at least five
million credits to fix it.

66
00:05:20.168 --> 00:05:21.043
- Dammit.

67
00:05:22.626 --> 00:05:23.459
- What did we get
for the crystal?

68
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.125
- 500,000.

69
00:05:25.835 --> 00:05:27.500
- Yeah, she totally screwed you.

70
00:05:27.501 --> 00:05:29.125
- Yeah, yeah, she screwed me...

71
00:05:30.543 --> 00:05:31.376
- Dad?

72
00:05:32.168 --> 00:05:33.667
What did you do now?

73
00:05:33.668 --> 00:05:34.793
- I didn't do anything.

74
00:05:36.043 --> 00:05:37.459
There was this coin.

75
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.667
It was like a...

76
00:05:38.668 --> 00:05:40.084
It's, it's- - Not again.

77
00:05:40.085 --> 00:05:40.792
- She left it out. I
didn't know what it was.

78
00:05:40.793 --> 00:05:41.792
- Dad!

79
00:05:44.751 --> 00:05:46.959
Is this a "we should probably
get going" situation,

80
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.042
or a "we should get the
hell outta here" situation?

81
00:05:49.043 --> 00:05:50.917
- You know I don't
like that language

82
00:05:50.918 --> 00:05:52.709
coming out of your mouth.

83
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.792
However, in this situation,
hell is appropriate.

84
00:05:57.835 --> 00:05:59.709
Speak of the devil.

85
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.500
- You must be the dumbest
man in all the galaxy.

86
00:06:02.501 --> 00:06:04.542
I'm not the
one who left an artifact

87
00:06:04.543 --> 00:06:06.750
from the Dandolian
period sitting out.

88
00:06:06.751 --> 00:06:11.500
- Return the coin at once
or suffer the consequences.

89
00:06:11.501 --> 00:06:13.209
- And what would
the consequences be?

90
00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.709
- I will tear you limb from limb

91
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.960
and bathe in your
blood and your tears.

92
00:06:19.835 --> 00:06:20.751
- Wow.

93
00:06:21.126 --> 00:06:23.167
- That must really mean
something to you, huh?

94
00:06:23.168 --> 00:06:26.500
- It belonged to my
sister before she died.

95
00:06:26.501 --> 00:06:28.835
It was her most
prized possession.

96
00:06:30.668 --> 00:06:33.125
- I'm sorry, I didn't
know that. My condolences.

97
00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:34.168
How did she die?

98
00:06:35.668 --> 00:06:36.501
- I killed her.

99
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.625
- Okay.

100
00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:41.710
Blast off.

101
00:06:43.043 --> 00:06:44.917
- Warning.
- Unauthorized ignition.

102
00:06:44.918 --> 00:06:46.792
750 Penalty points

103
00:06:46.793 --> 00:06:48.250
- have been applied to
your navigator's license.

104
00:06:48.251 --> 00:06:50.042
- Warning.
- Unauthorized liftoff.

105
00:07:01.043 --> 00:07:02.875
Your navigator's
license is revoked

106
00:07:02.876 --> 00:07:05.542
by the Department of Space
Vehicles under Code 750 point-

107
00:07:07.126 --> 00:07:10.001
Gravity
activated. Astrogator engaged.

108
00:07:12.543 --> 00:07:14.542
- What are we gonna do now?

109
00:07:14.543 --> 00:07:17.001
- We gotta find a big
score. Get back on our feet.

110
00:07:22.001 --> 00:07:23.042
- You shouldn't have
spent everything on-

111
00:07:23.043 --> 00:07:24.210
- Hey, hey, hey.

112
00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:28.667
Taylor, there's a lot of
things I regret in my life,

113
00:07:28.668 --> 00:07:30.085
but that's not one of 'em.

114
00:07:37.835 --> 00:07:42.085
Remember back in the day,
we'd head out into deep space.

115
00:07:43.585 --> 00:07:44.960
No chart, no plans.

116
00:07:48.126 --> 00:07:50.625
- We never had to
worry about credits.

117
00:07:50.626 --> 00:07:52.959
It was just about having fun.

118
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.959
- You said we can
make one more jump.

119
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.625
- Yeah.

120
00:07:56.626 --> 00:07:58.186
- Let's make it and
see where we end up.

121
00:07:59.293 --> 00:08:01.167
- A good old-fashioned
adventure.

122
00:08:01.168 --> 00:08:02.125
- Exactly.

123
00:08:08.126 --> 00:08:10.043
Neutrino
drive activated.

124
00:08:11.085 --> 00:08:11.960
- Hit it.

125
00:08:13.626 --> 00:08:17.834
Hyperjump
in three, two, one.

126
00:08:37.293 --> 00:08:39.585
Hypernavigator calculating.

127
00:08:42.126 --> 00:08:44.000
Come on,
let me handle this.

128
00:08:44.001 --> 00:08:46.959
- I am not going to risk
having to waste credits

129
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.000
to bring you back again.

130
00:08:49.001 --> 00:08:50.959
- I won't let you down, Mother.

131
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.834
That'll be a first.

132
00:08:52.835 --> 00:08:53.959
Cleanup in Zone 7.

133
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.167
Prisoner secured.

134
00:08:55.168 --> 00:08:57.084
Zone 7 is secured.

135
00:08:57.085 --> 00:09:01.959
- Fine. Assemble a small team
and retrieve that artifact.

136
00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.210
- What about Kip?

137
00:09:05.376 --> 00:09:07.292
- Bring him back
to me if you can.

138
00:09:07.293 --> 00:09:08.585
- And if I can't.

139
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.668
- Do what needs to be done.

140
00:09:12.376 --> 00:09:13.835
- He's as good as dead.

141
00:09:24.668 --> 00:09:26.084
Scanning
hyperchannels for tracker.

142
00:09:26.085 --> 00:09:27.667
- I hit them with a tracker.

143
00:09:27.668 --> 00:09:30.125
They did a jump to Sector 63A.

144
00:09:30.126 --> 00:09:31.209
Follow me.

145
00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:32.209
Copy that.

146
00:09:35.918 --> 00:09:38.292
- Oh, I'm so glad I found you.

147
00:09:38.293 --> 00:09:40.667
It's been so lonely

148
00:09:40.668 --> 00:09:42.667
all by myself.

149
00:09:42.668 --> 00:09:44.709
Now will you dance with me?

150
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:46.709
Just you and me.

151
00:09:55.876 --> 00:09:57.042
Wow.

152
00:10:09.335 --> 00:10:10.210
Oh no.

153
00:10:23.168 --> 00:10:24.126
- And there she is.

154
00:10:25.918 --> 00:10:27.375
- I don't know how she
thought she could escape us.

155
00:10:27.376 --> 00:10:29.209
Docking
coordinates locked.

156
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:30.959
Scanning comms channels.

157
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.292
- Can we link to her comms?

158
00:10:32.293 --> 00:10:34.250
- Negative. She's blocking us.

159
00:10:34.251 --> 00:10:37.417
- All right. Let's
knock on the door.

160
00:10:37.418 --> 00:10:38.459
- Okay.

161
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.417
- Hey, a friendly knock.

162
00:10:40.418 --> 00:10:42.167
She's no used to us dead.

163
00:10:42.168 --> 00:10:43.709
- As you wish.

164
00:10:45.251 --> 00:10:47.043
Weapon
systems armed.

165
00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:54.168
Station shields disabled.

166
00:10:55.793 --> 00:10:57.918
- Manx, prepare to
board the station.

167
00:11:11.293 --> 00:11:13.335
Target
detected. Sector 5.

168
00:11:17.918 --> 00:11:19.126
- Can you track that pod?

169
00:11:20.126 --> 00:11:21.126
- Give me a minute.

170
00:11:24.335 --> 00:11:25.959
Honing in on it.

171
00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.417
Tracking target.

172
00:11:27.418 --> 00:11:29.084
- Got it.

173
00:11:29.085 --> 00:11:31.460
You can
run but you cannot hide.

174
00:11:39.793 --> 00:11:42.084
Neutrino
core streaming.

175
00:11:42.085 --> 00:11:44.250
Life support steady.

176
00:11:44.251 --> 00:11:46.168
Charging EM batteries.

177
00:11:47.335 --> 00:11:48.376
- We'll get her back.

178
00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:51.751
- We never should've
been in that sector.

179
00:11:53.126 --> 00:11:54.876
- Well, I forgave
you. Mom will, too.

180
00:11:57.085 --> 00:11:58.335
- I hope so.

181
00:12:07.335 --> 00:12:08.835
Why don't you get some rest?

182
00:12:10.293 --> 00:12:13.001
I'm totally awake.

183
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.210
Maybe a nap will be okay.

184
00:12:18.168 --> 00:12:20.042
- Go on. I got this.

185
00:12:23.835 --> 00:12:24.875
- Love you, Dad.

186
00:12:24.876 --> 00:12:29.876
- I love you, baby.

187
00:12:30.543 --> 00:12:31.918
And I love you.

188
00:12:34.168 --> 00:12:35.251
And I'll get you back.

189
00:13:02.418 --> 00:13:05.417
Goodnight, Mom.

190
00:13:40.126 --> 00:13:42.167
Geoscanning.

191
00:13:42.168 --> 00:13:44.125
Planet profile: Class 1.

192
00:13:44.126 --> 00:13:46.334
And we have arrived.

193
00:13:46.335 --> 00:13:49.250
- Good. I need you to
stay with the ship.

194
00:13:49.251 --> 00:13:51.250
- Oh, let Manx stay.

195
00:13:51.251 --> 00:13:52.459
- I need someone I can trust.

196
00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.375
Autopilot engaged.

197
00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:58.043
- Manx is too dumb to even
think about betraying you.

198
00:13:59.293 --> 00:14:00.460
Come on, just

199
00:14:01.418 --> 00:14:02.293
let me go.

200
00:14:04.043 --> 00:14:06.209
- Fine, but you cannot
harm this woman in any way.

201
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:07.625
You understand?

202
00:14:07.626 --> 00:14:08.500
- Aw!

203
00:14:08.501 --> 00:14:10.084
You're no fun.

204
00:14:10.085 --> 00:14:12.125
Approaching target.

205
00:14:12.126 --> 00:14:14.460
- And soon I will
have all I desire.

206
00:14:16.585 --> 00:14:19.835
- And what is it
that you desire?

207
00:14:22.335 --> 00:14:23.460
- The universe.

208
00:14:35.668 --> 00:14:38.709
- Warning.
- Stellastar Station ahead.

209
00:14:48.376 --> 00:14:51.335
- Stellastar, this is Captain
Kip Corman. Are you there?

210
00:14:52.626 --> 00:14:54.168
Scanning
for life signs.

211
00:14:56.001 --> 00:14:57.961
Stellastar, are
you in need of assistance?

212
00:15:00.251 --> 00:15:02.210
Weapons scan clear.

213
00:15:07.251 --> 00:15:08.126
- Screw it.

214
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:28.543
- Dad?

215
00:15:31.543 --> 00:15:32.918
- Good morning, princess.

216
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:35.585
- Where am I?

217
00:15:37.168 --> 00:15:39.043
- You're in a Class
Six recovery unit.

218
00:15:40.751 --> 00:15:41.626
- Where's Mom?

219
00:15:45.126 --> 00:15:46.001
- Um...

220
00:15:50.085 --> 00:15:50.960
I spent

221
00:15:51.793 --> 00:15:53.210
everything we had,

222
00:15:54.585 --> 00:15:59.043
but I didn't have enough
to complete the process.

223
00:16:02.585 --> 00:16:03.584
I'm sorry.

224
00:16:40.251 --> 00:16:41.375
- Are we docked?

225
00:16:41.376 --> 00:16:43.334
- Space station floating dark.

226
00:16:43.335 --> 00:16:44.542
- Do they need help?

227
00:16:44.543 --> 00:16:46.250
- I offered. No reply.

228
00:16:46.251 --> 00:16:47.625
- So it's abandoned?

229
00:16:47.626 --> 00:16:48.792
- Apparently so.

230
00:16:48.793 --> 00:16:50.167
- You know what that means.

231
00:16:50.168 --> 00:16:51.084
- Back in the game, baby.

232
00:16:51.085 --> 00:16:52.459
- Yeah!

233
00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.459
Oh!

234
00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:57.292
The zero gravity stabilization
unit's malfunctioning.

235
00:16:57.293 --> 00:16:58.375
- Can you fix it?

236
00:16:58.376 --> 00:17:00.292
- Not without parts.

237
00:17:00.293 --> 00:17:03.459
- I'm gonna have to manually
rebalance the thermothrusters.

238
00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.792
Would you mind doing the
recon yourself, then?

239
00:17:05.793 --> 00:17:07.500
- Of course.

240
00:17:08.835 --> 00:17:10.500
I'll check for
parts first in order

241
00:17:10.501 --> 00:17:12.375
to get this old lady
back up and running.

242
00:17:12.376 --> 00:17:15.459
- Hey, she might be old,
but this ain't no lady.

243
00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.292
Keep me updated on
what you find, huh?

244
00:17:17.293 --> 00:17:18.667
- Will do.

245
00:17:18.668 --> 00:17:20.417
- Maybe you'll find
something cool.

246
00:17:24.168 --> 00:17:26.168
- We're almost there.

247
00:17:46.168 --> 00:17:47.085
- What did he say?

248
00:17:48.501 --> 00:17:49.917
- Something about
wanting to die.

249
00:17:49.918 --> 00:17:51.792
- Well, we can be hospitable.

250
00:17:51.793 --> 00:17:53.834
Let's honor their request.

251
00:17:53.835 --> 00:17:55.210
Tell them we accept.

252
00:18:00.668 --> 00:18:02.668
There we go!

253
00:18:49.543 --> 00:18:50.751
- That was fun.

254
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:53.501
Let's go.

255
00:19:01.376 --> 00:19:02.792
Mag Locks released.

256
00:19:02.793 --> 00:19:05.500
- Hey, Taylor, any
luck over there?

257
00:19:05.501 --> 00:19:07.667
I found some
of the parts we need.

258
00:19:07.668 --> 00:19:09.917
- Can you tell what
kind of station it is?

259
00:19:09.918 --> 00:19:13.709
It appears to be a
research station of some sort.

260
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:15.875
- Galactic or privately owned?

261
00:19:15.876 --> 00:19:19.292
- Definitely private.
- There is some contraband.

262
00:19:19.293 --> 00:19:20.709
- Anything interesting?

263
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:22.875
A whole
bunch of liquid stuff.

264
00:19:22.876 --> 00:19:25.459
- Ooh. I'll get
a bottle of that.

265
00:19:26.876 --> 00:19:28.417
Make it two.

266
00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.000
- Do you think those
things took her?

267
00:19:41.001 --> 00:19:41.876
- No.

268
00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.460
But you gotta admit,
she's pretty crafty.

269
00:19:46.543 --> 00:19:47.793
- She's still on the station.

270
00:20:17.335 --> 00:20:18.459
- Bless you.
- Thank you.

271
00:20:39.751 --> 00:20:40.626
Hello.

272
00:20:42.543 --> 00:20:45.001
I'm back on
board. Meet me in the back.

273
00:20:53.876 --> 00:20:54.918
- Stay right there.

274
00:20:56.543 --> 00:20:57.959
- Put the gun away.

275
00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.293
You're gonna wanna hear
what she has to say.

276
00:21:01.876 --> 00:21:03.542
- First, we need to get outta
here as soon as possible.

277
00:21:03.543 --> 00:21:05.542
We don't have much time.

278
00:21:05.543 --> 00:21:07.000
- I'm the captain of this ship.

279
00:21:07.001 --> 00:21:08.584
I'll decide what
needs to be done.

280
00:21:08.585 --> 00:21:11.042
- Look, I've got 16
million credits on here.

281
00:21:11.043 --> 00:21:13.500
Dad.

282
00:21:13.501 --> 00:21:16.376
- You're lucky. The captain
just decided it's time to go.

283
00:21:17.335 --> 00:21:18.417
- Okay.

284
00:21:22.626 --> 00:21:24.667
Sublight
engines online.

285
00:21:31.793 --> 00:21:34.709
- All right, tell me again,
where did you find her?

286
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.750
- She was hiding
in a space suit.

287
00:21:36.751 --> 00:21:37.834
- And you trust her?

288
00:21:37.835 --> 00:21:39.042
- She seems harmless.

289
00:21:39.043 --> 00:21:40.500
- Taylor, that's what you said

290
00:21:40.501 --> 00:21:42.417
about that three-headed
baby dragon

291
00:21:42.418 --> 00:21:44.750
that grew into the
destroyer of worlds.

292
00:21:44.751 --> 00:21:47.335
- I don't think we have
to worry about that.

293
00:21:54.626 --> 00:21:55.460
- Hmm.

294
00:22:05.043 --> 00:22:06.709
Scanning for targets.

295
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:09.376
- Were they worthy opponents?

296
00:22:10.751 --> 00:22:13.793
- No. They weren't
much of a challenge.

297
00:22:15.126 --> 00:22:19.000
- Nothing's a challenge
for the mighty Manx.

298
00:22:19.001 --> 00:22:22.626
- I strike fear in the
hearts of those who cross me.

299
00:22:24.751 --> 00:22:26.709
I demand my turn.

300
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:30.875
I will go on that ship
and kill that woman dead.

301
00:22:30.876 --> 00:22:32.917
- And you were worried about me.

302
00:22:32.918 --> 00:22:33.793
- Sit down!

303
00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:39.792
We can in no way, shape,
or form hurt the woman.

304
00:22:39.793 --> 00:22:42.835
You win by bringing
her back to me alive.

305
00:22:45.668 --> 00:22:47.168
- Then I will deliver her to you

306
00:22:48.501 --> 00:22:49.376
alive

307
00:22:50.168 --> 00:22:51.043
and unharmed.

308
00:22:55.043 --> 00:22:57.000
- Okay, talk.

309
00:22:57.001 --> 00:22:58.875
- My name's Jackie.

310
00:22:58.876 --> 00:22:59.960
It's nice to meet you.

311
00:23:02.793 --> 00:23:04.667
Aren't you gonna
tell me your name?

312
00:23:04.668 --> 00:23:07.376
I know your daughter's name's
Taylor. She's very pretty.

313
00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:10.584
- Kip.

314
00:23:10.585 --> 00:23:12.125
- Oh, that's a nice name.

315
00:23:12.126 --> 00:23:13.167
Captain Kip.

316
00:23:13.168 --> 00:23:14.584
- Just Kip.

317
00:23:14.585 --> 00:23:15.460
- Yes, sir.

318
00:23:17.043 --> 00:23:20.542
I'm a scientist. I specialize
in celestial cartography.

319
00:23:20.543 --> 00:23:21.917
- Celestial cartography?

320
00:23:21.918 --> 00:23:23.709
- Mm-hmm, it's a
branch of cartography

321
00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:26.500
that deals with mapping
stars, galaxies,

322
00:23:26.501 --> 00:23:29.042
other astronomical objects
on the celestial sphere.

323
00:23:29.043 --> 00:23:30.709
- Wait, you told
me you were hiding

324
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:32.542
from some dangerous people.

325
00:23:32.543 --> 00:23:36.125
- Yes, Dykstra, the leader
of the group after me.

326
00:23:36.126 --> 00:23:38.542
He read some of my theories
regarding some ships

327
00:23:38.543 --> 00:23:39.917
getting lost in the
Triangulum Rift,

328
00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:41.834
including the
legendary Deepstar.

329
00:23:41.835 --> 00:23:43.834
- People have been looking
for the Deepstar for years.

330
00:23:43.835 --> 00:23:45.750
It can't be found.

331
00:23:45.751 --> 00:23:47.667
- That's 'cause they can't
find the distress beacon.

332
00:23:47.668 --> 00:23:50.625
You find the beacon, you
can find the Deepstar.

333
00:23:50.626 --> 00:23:51.835
I know where it is.

334
00:23:52.876 --> 00:23:54.626
It's what brought Dykstra to me.

335
00:23:56.001 --> 00:23:58.542
He said he was part
of a private firm

336
00:23:58.543 --> 00:24:00.000
seeking a salvage claim,

337
00:24:00.001 --> 00:24:02.667
and he wanted me to
plot them the course.

338
00:24:02.668 --> 00:24:05.250
Their goal was to
find the Deepstar

339
00:24:05.251 --> 00:24:07.918
and claim the vast
riches on board.

340
00:24:11.751 --> 00:24:15.000
I started to notice that some
things were off about Dykstra,

341
00:24:15.001 --> 00:24:16.209
and his team.

342
00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:17.875
- What do you mean by off?

343
00:24:17.876 --> 00:24:20.043
- They pretty much kill
everyone they encounter.

344
00:24:21.001 --> 00:24:22.085
And they enjoy it.

345
00:24:24.251 --> 00:24:27.750
I realized that once I found
the Deepstar, I'd be next.

346
00:24:27.751 --> 00:24:31.750
So when we stopped on Dover,
I borrowed a ship and escaped.

347
00:24:31.751 --> 00:24:33.250
- Borrowed?

348
00:24:33.251 --> 00:24:34.460
- Without permission.

349
00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:37.709
I feel bad about it. I do.

350
00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:39.209
The ship was damaged
in the escape,

351
00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:41.084
and dead as a
Carnelian cowerpuss.

352
00:24:41.085 --> 00:24:43.250
- Well, you're lucky you
stumbled upon the station.

353
00:24:43.251 --> 00:24:45.959
- Oh, that wasn't luck. I
worked there 10 years ago.

354
00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.584
The lucky part was my
credentials were still valid.

355
00:24:48.585 --> 00:24:51.084
My goal was to get to the
station, borrow another ship,

356
00:24:51.085 --> 00:24:53.125
but the station was empty.

357
00:24:53.126 --> 00:24:55.209
The log said that they
were on a research mission

358
00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:56.959
to the outer rim.

359
00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.750
My ship was too damaged
to fix, so I waited,

360
00:24:59.751 --> 00:25:01.501
hoping that someone
would show up.

361
00:25:04.126 --> 00:25:05.959
- If we find the Deepstar,

362
00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.085
we could get enough
credits to bring Mom back.

363
00:25:10.585 --> 00:25:11.751
- Why do you trust us?

364
00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.626
- You haven't tried to kill me.

365
00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:20.250
- Well, what about these
guys you said are after you?

366
00:25:20.251 --> 00:25:21.667
- Oh.

367
00:25:21.668 --> 00:25:23.125
- Don't worry.

368
00:25:23.126 --> 00:25:24.543
I left something for 'em.

369
00:25:25.293 --> 00:25:26.834
- That's my girl.

370
00:25:28.168 --> 00:25:29.917
- Jackie!

371
00:25:29.918 --> 00:25:32.334
It's the mighty Manx!

372
00:25:32.335 --> 00:25:35.292
I am here to return
you to Dykstra.

373
00:25:45.335 --> 00:25:46.210
Where are you hiding?

374
00:25:51.001 --> 00:25:51.834
Oh!

375
00:25:56.626 --> 00:25:59.085
- I can't believe
you let him go alone.

376
00:26:00.668 --> 00:26:03.250
- Even Manx could
not screw this up.

377
00:26:07.876 --> 00:26:09.000
Debris collision.

378
00:26:09.001 --> 00:26:10.917
- What the hell happened?

379
00:26:10.918 --> 00:26:12.167
Well, it couldn't
have been a power surge.

380
00:26:12.168 --> 00:26:13.292
The station was dead.

381
00:26:13.293 --> 00:26:14.959
- Dead is what Manx is,

382
00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.125
though I will not
share a tear for him.

383
00:26:17.126 --> 00:26:19.709
Jackie, though, we needed her.

384
00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:21.125
- I know.

385
00:26:21.126 --> 00:26:22.417
- Check the ship
and try to find out

386
00:26:22.418 --> 00:26:24.085
what kind of damage we incurred.

387
00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:28.043
- Warning.
- Structural impacts.

388
00:26:29.168 --> 00:26:31.042
Systems alert.

389
00:26:31.043 --> 00:26:33.084
Life systems compromised.

390
00:26:33.085 --> 00:26:36.001
- The Deepstar was so close.

391
00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:38.710
I could almost feel it.

392
00:26:39.793 --> 00:26:40.792
- There still may be hope.

393
00:26:40.793 --> 00:26:42.709
I found something-

394
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:45.375
- She was the only person who
had any chance of finding it.

395
00:26:45.376 --> 00:26:47.292
- Well if you would
let me finish.

396
00:26:47.293 --> 00:26:50.042
I found a signal for a ship
that recently left the station.

397
00:26:50.043 --> 00:26:52.417
She may have escaped on it.

398
00:26:52.418 --> 00:26:53.335
- Can you find it?

399
00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:55.085
- Already on it.

400
00:27:02.335 --> 00:27:05.084
Astrocharts calculating.

401
00:27:10.251 --> 00:27:11.251
- Don't touch that.

402
00:27:15.418 --> 00:27:17.126
- Ooh!
- Stop touching things!

403
00:27:21.793 --> 00:27:22.875
- Ah.
- Stop!

404
00:27:22.876 --> 00:27:23.751
Please.

405
00:27:25.793 --> 00:27:26.793
- Excuse me.

406
00:27:28.918 --> 00:27:30.292
I fixed the turbo thrusters,

407
00:27:30.293 --> 00:27:32.459
but the hyperspeed
is still shot.

408
00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.334
- Good work.

409
00:27:34.335 --> 00:27:36.250
Sublight
incursion. Proximity alert.

410
00:27:36.251 --> 00:27:38.167
- I think we got company.

411
00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:46.375
- Did you really think you
could run across the galaxy

412
00:27:46.376 --> 00:27:49.167
with my property and
I wouldn't find you?

413
00:27:49.168 --> 00:27:51.375
Tell me that you're
not that stupid.

414
00:27:51.376 --> 00:27:52.835
- I'm not that stupid.

415
00:27:54.126 --> 00:27:56.042
- You're in no position
to be a smartass.

416
00:27:56.043 --> 00:27:57.959
- Am I a smartass
or am I stupid?

417
00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.167
You know, you're starting
to sound confused, Elnora.

418
00:28:00.168 --> 00:28:02.918
- I will make you wish
that you were never born!

419
00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.875
I will rip out your fleshy parts

420
00:28:05.876 --> 00:28:10.043
and proudly display them
on my desk in a glass jar.

421
00:28:11.918 --> 00:28:15.500
That way, if anyone thinks
of ever crossing me again,

422
00:28:15.501 --> 00:28:18.834
they'll see what lies
ahead in their future.

423
00:28:18.835 --> 00:28:20.125
- This is my old boss.

424
00:28:20.126 --> 00:28:22.084
- Oh. Hi, I'm Jackie.

425
00:28:22.085 --> 00:28:22.960
- Shut up!

426
00:28:24.085 --> 00:28:26.000
- She's rude.

427
00:28:26.001 --> 00:28:28.459
- Uh, guys, I would save this
conversation for another time.

428
00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.375
Warning. Proximity Alert.

429
00:28:30.376 --> 00:28:31.750
Multiple sectors.

430
00:28:31.751 --> 00:28:33.000
- Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

431
00:28:33.001 --> 00:28:33.750
- Probably not.

432
00:28:33.751 --> 00:28:34.671
- What are we thinking?

433
00:28:35.085 --> 00:28:36.501
- Sit down.

434
00:28:47.251 --> 00:28:51.209
- You will never
get away from me,

435
00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:52.834
ever.

436
00:28:52.835 --> 00:28:55.167
We can thank
the asteroid field

437
00:28:55.168 --> 00:28:57.042
for that bit of luck.

438
00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:01.000
- What are you waiting for?

439
00:29:01.001 --> 00:29:02.834
- They're entering
an asteroid field.

440
00:29:02.835 --> 00:29:04.292
- So what?

441
00:29:04.293 --> 00:29:06.375
- It's too dangerous.
They'll never survive.

442
00:29:06.376 --> 00:29:08.542
- I wouldn't be too
sure about that.

443
00:29:08.543 --> 00:29:11.584
- I'm not scared. I'll go
in there and make you proud.

444
00:29:11.585 --> 00:29:14.875
- I would expect nothing
less of my flesh and blood.

445
00:29:14.876 --> 00:29:16.334
- For the family, I will-

446
00:29:16.335 --> 00:29:18.210
- All right, just
get on with it!

447
00:29:27.126 --> 00:29:30.167
Warning. Warning.

448
00:29:35.251 --> 00:29:36.959
Collision imminent.

449
00:29:44.918 --> 00:29:46.543
Hostiles approaching.

450
00:29:51.418 --> 00:29:52.918
- Guys, we have company.

451
00:29:59.918 --> 00:30:02.250
- I order you to support him.

452
00:30:02.251 --> 00:30:04.000
- Are you serious?

453
00:30:04.001 --> 00:30:06.293
- Help him or don't
bother coming back.

454
00:30:15.001 --> 00:30:16.250
This was a bad idea.

455
00:30:16.251 --> 00:30:17.625
- Too late now.

456
00:30:29.126 --> 00:30:30.168
He's right on us.

457
00:30:32.418 --> 00:30:34.085
- I can't shake him.

458
00:30:37.168 --> 00:30:38.542
But...

459
00:30:38.543 --> 00:30:40.085
- Warning.
- Collision alert.

460
00:30:41.126 --> 00:30:42.625
- I can bake them. You ready?

461
00:30:42.626 --> 00:30:43.917
- Yeah.

462
00:30:43.918 --> 00:30:45.209
- What now?
- Go!

463
00:30:46.376 --> 00:30:48.960
Warning. Warning.

464
00:30:49.918 --> 00:30:52.000
Collision imminent.

465
00:31:03.335 --> 00:31:04.959
- Not again.

466
00:31:09.001 --> 00:31:10.500
- Way to go, Ezekiel!

467
00:31:10.501 --> 00:31:12.000
- Time to get out of here.

468
00:31:16.251 --> 00:31:17.667
- Oh, you did.

469
00:31:19.001 --> 00:31:20.459
- Y'all are nuts!

470
00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:21.667
- Status report.

471
00:31:21.668 --> 00:31:24.000
- The ship has been destroyed.

472
00:31:24.001 --> 00:31:25.500
- Are you sure?

473
00:31:25.501 --> 00:31:27.418
- Yes. There's been
a massive explosion.

474
00:31:29.001 --> 00:31:30.667
- Ezekiel should be
in communication range

475
00:31:30.668 --> 00:31:33.417
on the other side of the
asteroid field momentarily.

476
00:31:40.418 --> 00:31:41.542
- You're alive?

477
00:31:41.543 --> 00:31:43.209
- And well.

478
00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:45.542
The other ship, I'm
afraid not so much.

479
00:31:45.543 --> 00:31:49.543
- My son, Ezekiel, was
piloting that ship.

480
00:31:53.376 --> 00:31:54.376
- I didn't know that.

481
00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:58.584
From one parent to another,
I'm truly sorry, Elnora.

482
00:31:58.585 --> 00:32:01.375
- Sorry doesn't
replace the credits

483
00:32:01.376 --> 00:32:04.250
I'm going to have to spend
to bring him back again.

484
00:32:04.251 --> 00:32:07.709
- The credits, that's what
you're upset about? The credits?

485
00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:09.542
- Mark my words.

486
00:32:09.543 --> 00:32:11.376
You will pay!

487
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:22.709
Rebooting.

488
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:24.543
- How much damage
have we sustained?

489
00:32:26.043 --> 00:32:28.250
- She'll fly, but just barely.

490
00:32:28.251 --> 00:32:29.667
- Well, that's all we need.

491
00:32:29.668 --> 00:32:31.668
Nina is tracking a ship.

492
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:36.084
- You think she escaped?

493
00:32:36.085 --> 00:32:37.667
- I hope so.

494
00:32:37.668 --> 00:32:40.292
Otherwise all this
is for nothing.

495
00:32:47.793 --> 00:32:49.750
- You sure it's this one?

496
00:32:49.751 --> 00:32:52.460
- If the coordinates were
input correctly, then yes.

497
00:32:53.793 --> 00:32:55.542
- I know why no one's
found the beacon.

498
00:32:55.543 --> 00:32:56.584
- Why?

499
00:32:56.585 --> 00:32:58.043
- This is planet Zeno.

500
00:32:59.418 --> 00:33:01.750
It's also known
as a death planet,

501
00:33:01.751 --> 00:33:04.542
rumored to be
inhabited by giants.

502
00:33:04.543 --> 00:33:06.501
They'd see us coming
from miles away.

503
00:33:09.376 --> 00:33:10.626
Okay.

504
00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:14.793
- What about the pod?

505
00:33:16.626 --> 00:33:19.334
It's small. It might be able
to slip through undetected.

506
00:33:19.335 --> 00:33:21.292
- It's a delivery
system, Taylor.

507
00:33:21.293 --> 00:33:23.292
It's designed to
be flown remotely.

508
00:33:23.293 --> 00:33:24.667
- But there are controls.

509
00:33:24.668 --> 00:33:26.292
I've used it before.
I can fly it.

510
00:33:26.293 --> 00:33:28.460
- No, no, we're not
doing this, okay?

511
00:33:29.626 --> 00:33:31.459
All right. I'll do it.

512
00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:34.500
- No! The controls require
minute adjustments.

513
00:33:34.501 --> 00:33:36.334
You're too heavy handed.

514
00:33:36.335 --> 00:33:37.210
- I'll go.

515
00:33:38.585 --> 00:33:40.793
- It's our best chance
of getting Mom back.

516
00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:45.293
- We're not even
sure it's down there.

517
00:33:47.251 --> 00:33:48.542
- May I?

518
00:33:48.543 --> 00:33:49.542
- Go ahead.

519
00:33:49.543 --> 00:33:51.209
- Okay.

520
00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:52.625
We're close enough
now that I think

521
00:33:52.626 --> 00:33:54.066
that we can hear
the distress beacon.

522
00:33:55.501 --> 00:33:57.209
You hear that?

523
00:33:57.210 --> 00:33:58.709
It's there!

524
00:34:01.626 --> 00:34:02.501
- Dad.

525
00:34:03.543 --> 00:34:05.085
We have to do it.

526
00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:09.168
- I can't go through
it again, Taylor.

527
00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:15.335
- I won't let that happen.

528
00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:17.501
I promise.

529
00:34:21.668 --> 00:34:22.501
- Take a rifle.

530
00:34:23.626 --> 00:34:24.501
- Okay.

531
00:34:52.418 --> 00:34:53.835
Engines to speed.

532
00:34:54.876 --> 00:34:56.793
Trajectory calculating.

533
00:35:13.668 --> 00:35:16.250
- I shouldn't have let her go.

534
00:35:16.251 --> 00:35:18.418
- Do you really think
you could've stopped her?

535
00:35:19.585 --> 00:35:20.418
- No.

536
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:27.375
- I just can't stand not knowing
what's going on down there.

537
00:35:27.376 --> 00:35:28.460
- She'll be fine.

538
00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:32.292
I can tell, she's special.

539
00:35:57.293 --> 00:35:57.960
- Whoa!

540
00:36:01.751 --> 00:36:03.335
You are a big guy.

541
00:36:08.001 --> 00:36:10.500
Okay, move along, big guy.

542
00:36:30.835 --> 00:36:32.501
Okay, I get it now.

543
00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:24.876
- Who's the picture of?

544
00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:27.835
- That is my wife.

545
00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:30.335
- She's pretty.

546
00:37:32.418 --> 00:37:34.710
I always wanted to
be part of a family.

547
00:37:36.543 --> 00:37:38.000
Where is she?

548
00:37:38.001 --> 00:37:38.876
- She's...

549
00:37:40.876 --> 00:37:42.792
The beacon's moving.

550
00:37:44.585 --> 00:37:46.709
- Ha! That means she has it.

551
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:47.793
She has it!

552
00:39:16.751 --> 00:39:19.000
Launch
sequence activated.

553
00:39:21.793 --> 00:39:23.001
Engines to speed.

554
00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:30.126
Trajectory calculating.

555
00:39:35.835 --> 00:39:36.710
- What's going on?

556
00:39:38.085 --> 00:39:39.960
Tractor
alert. Tractor alert.

557
00:39:41.168 --> 00:39:42.001
- Oh no!

558
00:39:47.168 --> 00:39:48.626
- She should be back now.

559
00:39:50.751 --> 00:39:52.834
- The beacon stopped moving.

560
00:39:53.876 --> 00:39:55.500
- Who am I speaking to?

561
00:39:55.501 --> 00:39:57.918
- Captain Kip
Corman. Who are you?

562
00:39:59.751 --> 00:40:02.000
- My name is Dykstra. I'm
sure you've heard about me.

563
00:40:02.001 --> 00:40:03.667
- I have.

564
00:40:03.668 --> 00:40:05.542
- Then you know the
position you're in.

565
00:40:05.543 --> 00:40:07.500
I have your woman.

566
00:40:07.501 --> 00:40:11.043
- What I do know is that if
you hurt her, I will kill you.

567
00:40:12.168 --> 00:40:14.000
- I'm not gonna hurt her,

568
00:40:14.001 --> 00:40:16.084
but my friend here,
that's a different story.

569
00:40:16.085 --> 00:40:18.710
All I have to do
is snap my finger

570
00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:23.668
and things can get very messy.

571
00:40:25.001 --> 00:40:26.750
I'll make you a trade.

572
00:40:26.751 --> 00:40:29.000
I will dock your ship,

573
00:40:29.001 --> 00:40:31.209
I give you your woman,
you give me mine,

574
00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:33.875
and that's the only
offer on the table.

575
00:40:33.876 --> 00:40:36.876
I know I can count on you
to make the right decision.

576
00:40:40.543 --> 00:40:42.168
- I knew I shouldn't
have let it go.

577
00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:44.917
- It's okay.

578
00:40:44.918 --> 00:40:46.834
I'll go.

579
00:40:46.835 --> 00:40:49.209
- If he's who you say he is,
he'll kill us all regardless.

580
00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:50.168
- So what do we do?

581
00:40:52.085 --> 00:40:53.542
- Kill him first.

582
00:41:16.251 --> 00:41:17.835
Eyes open, Jackie.

583
00:41:23.918 --> 00:41:24.751
Jackie?

584
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:43.960
- That's enough!

585
00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:49.210
Nina, come and join the party.

586
00:41:50.793 --> 00:41:51.626
- Gladly.

587
00:41:52.835 --> 00:41:53.959
- I'm sorry.

588
00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:54.959
- What did you do to her?

589
00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.625
- I gave her a sedative.

590
00:41:56.626 --> 00:41:58.000
- Do whatever you want
to me. Just let her go.

591
00:41:58.001 --> 00:41:58.876
- I was gonna.

592
00:42:00.293 --> 00:42:02.710
I'm not the monster
I'm made out to be.

593
00:42:03.793 --> 00:42:05.584
But you know, I changed my mind.

594
00:42:05.585 --> 00:42:08.043
You can keep Jackie.
I don't need her.

595
00:42:09.001 --> 00:42:10.792
I have what I need.

596
00:42:10.793 --> 00:42:12.625
- Why did you offer a trade?

597
00:42:12.626 --> 00:42:16.625
Because you have something
really important that I want.

598
00:42:19.876 --> 00:42:21.835
- Don't, don't touch her.

599
00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:28.250
- I don't need her.
I need your ship.

600
00:42:28.251 --> 00:42:30.167
See, this one has
seen better days

601
00:42:30.168 --> 00:42:33.667
and it looks like you made
it worse, and for that,

602
00:42:33.668 --> 00:42:37.000
I'm gonna keep this little
pretty thing as payment.

603
00:42:37.001 --> 00:42:38.375
- I'll kill you. I swear to God.

604
00:42:40.251 --> 00:42:42.000
- Famous last words.

605
00:42:44.376 --> 00:42:46.167
Goodbye, Captain.

606
00:42:51.335 --> 00:42:53.834
Hull
integrity collapsed.

607
00:42:53.835 --> 00:42:55.334
- What should we do with her?

608
00:42:55.335 --> 00:42:57.375
- Leave her. They
can die together.

609
00:43:00.751 --> 00:43:03.043
A captain is supposed to
go down with his ship.

610
00:43:04.668 --> 00:43:06.068
Lucky for me, this
is your ship now.

611
00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:21.417
- Taylor!

612
00:43:26.043 --> 00:43:27.210
Mom

613
00:43:29.168 --> 00:43:30.043
Taylor!

614
00:43:31.335 --> 00:43:32.875
Taylor!

615
00:43:40.751 --> 00:43:42.043
- Try not to move too much.

616
00:43:43.876 --> 00:43:46.668
Don't worry. Effects of the
medication will soon subside.

617
00:44:00.043 --> 00:44:01.293
- Can I get a swig of that?

618
00:44:18.876 --> 00:44:20.792
You the enforcer of your team?

619
00:44:20.793 --> 00:44:22.834
- I'm not part of any team.

620
00:44:22.835 --> 00:44:24.418
- But you're the
tough guy, right?

621
00:44:27.126 --> 00:44:28.792
- Yeah.

622
00:44:28.793 --> 00:44:33.793
You could say that.

623
00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:39.375
- Where are you from?

624
00:44:39.376 --> 00:44:40.251
- Jeriba.

625
00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:45.085
- Moon of criminal scum.

626
00:44:47.001 --> 00:44:48.417
- You've been there?

627
00:44:48.418 --> 00:44:49.293
- No.

628
00:44:50.293 --> 00:44:52.375
But I've heard stories.

629
00:44:52.376 --> 00:44:54.084
- Yeah.

630
00:44:54.085 --> 00:44:57.210
The stories are pretty
bad, but it's way worse.

631
00:44:58.751 --> 00:45:00.251
Definitely not a
place for women.

632
00:45:03.335 --> 00:45:04.168
Maybe Nina.

633
00:45:05.418 --> 00:45:06.918
She'd probably do all right.

634
00:45:12.001 --> 00:45:13.335
My mom tried,

635
00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:17.835
but...

636
00:45:20.876 --> 00:45:22.417
- What happened?

637
00:45:22.418 --> 00:45:23.918
- She got sick.

638
00:45:25.293 --> 00:45:27.168
She used to scream
all night long.

639
00:45:28.543 --> 00:45:30.335
The screams still
echo in my head.

640
00:45:35.793 --> 00:45:37.210
And then she died.

641
00:45:41.793 --> 00:45:43.876
- What are you doing
with these criminals?

642
00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:46.043
- I am scum,

643
00:45:47.251 --> 00:45:48.251
just like them.

644
00:45:50.835 --> 00:45:51.501
- No.

645
00:45:53.876 --> 00:45:54.835
You seem different.

646
00:46:02.501 --> 00:46:04.001
- Captain, can you hear me?

647
00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.084
Hey.

648
00:46:08.085 --> 00:46:09.375
- How long have I been out?

649
00:46:09.376 --> 00:46:10.335
- An hour or so.

650
00:46:12.918 --> 00:46:16.334
- We got to get the ship up
and running and get after them.

651
00:46:16.335 --> 00:46:17.210
Whoa!

652
00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:20.375
We, uh,

653
00:46:20.376 --> 00:46:22.417
we must have tools
and spare parts

654
00:46:22.418 --> 00:46:24.042
somewhere around here, right?

655
00:46:24.043 --> 00:46:26.375
- Yes. I gathered
everything I could find.

656
00:46:26.376 --> 00:46:28.292
- All right, let's get to it.

657
00:46:42.085 --> 00:46:43.917
- This stuff is strong.

658
00:46:43.918 --> 00:46:45.043
- Lightweight.

659
00:46:48.001 --> 00:46:49.418
- You better not try anything.

660
00:46:51.126 --> 00:46:52.918
- I'd like to try
a lot of things.

661
00:46:54.043 --> 00:46:56.584
- Well, what are
you waiting for?

662
00:47:32.168 --> 00:47:33.167
Tease.

663
00:47:33.168 --> 00:47:34.917
- I will shoot you.

664
00:47:34.918 --> 00:47:38.292
- Yeah, you don't
have the balls.

665
00:47:40.918 --> 00:47:41.585
- Oh, I...

666
00:47:43.126 --> 00:47:44.918
I think you need
this for it to work.

667
00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:49.084
It's a shame.

668
00:47:49.085 --> 00:47:51.005
I was hoping to get a
little bit of action first.

669
00:47:52.335 --> 00:47:53.168
- Let's go.

670
00:47:55.043 --> 00:47:56.667
- I'm over it, honey.

671
00:47:56.668 --> 00:47:57.501
Maybe later.

672
00:48:02.043 --> 00:48:04.459
- Captain, can I get
the slazon, please?

673
00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:05.335
- Got it. Here.

674
00:48:07.668 --> 00:48:09.000
- Thank you.

675
00:48:14.043 --> 00:48:15.918
Whoa, I'm feeling lightheaded.

676
00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:19.084
- We're probably
running low on oxygen.

677
00:48:19.085 --> 00:48:20.500
- How much time do we have?

678
00:48:20.501 --> 00:48:22.000
- A ship this size,

679
00:48:22.001 --> 00:48:23.210
well, three hours.

680
00:48:25.085 --> 00:48:27.334
- Why do I feel a but coming?

681
00:48:27.335 --> 00:48:29.000
- Well, the last hour,

682
00:48:29.001 --> 00:48:31.043
the body will be
fighting to stay alive.

683
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:35.001
Physical activity will be
pretty much nonexistent.

684
00:48:36.376 --> 00:48:38.542
- You coulda just
said two hours.

685
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:44.376
- Your gun wasn't the
only thing I found.

686
00:48:50.543 --> 00:48:54.293
Tell me, does it really bring
people back from the dead?

687
00:48:58.376 --> 00:48:59.585
- A body dies.

688
00:49:01.418 --> 00:49:05.125
Their soul and being can be
kept alive through extraction.

689
00:49:05.126 --> 00:49:08.460
The body, created through
robotics and donor tissue,

690
00:49:09.543 --> 00:49:11.584
is an exact replica.

691
00:49:11.585 --> 00:49:15.375
- A cyborg-human hybrid's
hardly a human being.

692
00:49:15.376 --> 00:49:17.710
- A body isn't what
defines a person.

693
00:49:19.501 --> 00:49:24.209
It's their soul, their
essence that matters.

694
00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:27.626
- Tell you what, If I ever
run into one of those freaks,

695
00:49:30.085 --> 00:49:32.043
I'll kill it on principle alone.

696
00:49:34.043 --> 00:49:35.251
- How would you even know?

697
00:49:36.251 --> 00:49:37.293
- Oh, I'd know.

698
00:49:41.751 --> 00:49:43.417
- Be careful with that.

699
00:49:43.418 --> 00:49:44.293
- Who is it?

700
00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:49.085
- My mom.

701
00:49:55.626 --> 00:49:56.626
- Well, don't worry.

702
00:49:58.168 --> 00:49:59.710
I'll take good care of her.

703
00:50:05.835 --> 00:50:07.250
Ow!

704
00:50:07.251 --> 00:50:08.126
Dammit!

705
00:50:10.126 --> 00:50:11.001
God!

706
00:50:22.751 --> 00:50:27.709
- You never did finish
telling me about your wife.

707
00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:29.417
Please?

708
00:50:29.418 --> 00:50:30.543
I'd really like to know.

709
00:50:33.668 --> 00:50:37.334
- We were rich and
we loved adventures.

710
00:50:37.335 --> 00:50:40.125
We went places we
never should've went.

711
00:50:40.126 --> 00:50:43.334
And I took chances I
shouldn't have taken.

712
00:50:43.335 --> 00:50:45.043
We crashed.

713
00:50:47.585 --> 00:50:48.793
We lost an awful lot.

714
00:50:52.418 --> 00:50:53.668
But I could buy it back.

715
00:50:54.668 --> 00:50:56.459
So I thought.

716
00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:59.585
I didn't realize how
expensive essence was.

717
00:51:00.793 --> 00:51:02.210
I spent everything we had.

718
00:51:03.585 --> 00:51:05.667
Now we do these
salvage missions,

719
00:51:05.668 --> 00:51:07.335
hoping to get enough credits to

720
00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:11.584
finish the process
of bringing her back.

721
00:51:11.585 --> 00:51:13.417
- You will.

722
00:51:13.418 --> 00:51:15.250
If everything they say
about the Deepstar is true,

723
00:51:15.251 --> 00:51:17.417
you will have so many credits,

724
00:51:17.418 --> 00:51:20.250
you'll have nothing to
worry about ever again.

725
00:51:20.251 --> 00:51:22.250
You'll be set for life.

726
00:51:24.835 --> 00:51:26.876
- All I want is my family back.

727
00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:30.710
- Then let's finish the
repairs and go get them.

728
00:51:48.210 --> 00:51:51.792
I told you I
would find the Deepstar.

729
00:51:51.793 --> 00:51:53.460
- And I never doubted you.

730
00:51:55.251 --> 00:51:57.292
- That's why you are the only
one I will share it with.

731
00:51:57.293 --> 00:51:58.210
- What about Wade?

732
00:51:59.501 --> 00:52:01.542
- Wade, he's too unstable.

733
00:52:01.543 --> 00:52:02.750
- Hmm.

734
00:52:02.751 --> 00:52:04.418
And when the time comes,

735
00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:08.126
I want you to take care of him.

736
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:12.251
- Anything for you.

737
00:52:21.751 --> 00:52:23.209
- My son

738
00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:24.792
is dead again

739
00:52:24.793 --> 00:52:25.917
because of you.

740
00:52:25.918 --> 00:52:27.375
- He was a better pilot than me.

741
00:52:27.376 --> 00:52:28.375
- Me too.

742
00:52:28.376 --> 00:52:29.668
- So are you both saying

743
00:52:30.876 --> 00:52:32.709
that my son is dead

744
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:35.667
because you're both
inadequate with your jobs?

745
00:52:35.668 --> 00:52:37.417
- Yeah, uh, no. I mean, no.

746
00:52:41.001 --> 00:52:43.917
- Ezekiel was the best.

747
00:52:43.918 --> 00:52:46.000
I had no doubt in my mind

748
00:52:46.001 --> 00:52:48.792
that he would
complete the mission.

749
00:52:48.793 --> 00:52:51.459
- Are you saying that he failed?

750
00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:52.709
- No. Yes.

751
00:52:57.585 --> 00:52:58.793
- Prepare my ship.

752
00:52:59.793 --> 00:53:01.668
I'll kill Kip myself.

753
00:53:06.876 --> 00:53:09.460
- Well, only one
thing left to do.

754
00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:12.959
- Well, stick it in.

755
00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:16.584
- No, it's not that simple.
It could go in two places.

756
00:53:16.585 --> 00:53:18.834
You put it one place
and it fixes the ship

757
00:53:18.835 --> 00:53:20.709
and it brings the
main power online.

758
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:23.875
You put it in the other, it
manually starts the hyperdrive,

759
00:53:23.876 --> 00:53:25.417
but if you start the hyperdrive

760
00:53:25.418 --> 00:53:26.959
without being fully powered up,

761
00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:29.000
the ship will be crushed
like an empty can.

762
00:53:29.001 --> 00:53:30.750
- Well, which one does it go in?

763
00:53:30.751 --> 00:53:32.667
- I don't know. Taylor
usually does this stuff.

764
00:53:32.668 --> 00:53:34.000
- Come on.

765
00:53:34.001 --> 00:53:35.917
We're running outta time.

766
00:53:35.918 --> 00:53:38.875
Now we're gonna run into that
hour-long death struggle thing

767
00:53:38.876 --> 00:53:42.709
and I would really like
to avoid that, please.

768
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:43.585
- All right.

769
00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:46.960
Let's flip a coin.

770
00:53:48.668 --> 00:53:51.335
- That is a Dandolian
Reclam. Where did you get it?

771
00:53:52.335 --> 00:53:53.585
- I borrowed it.

772
00:53:55.043 --> 00:53:55.918
Tails.

773
00:54:00.626 --> 00:54:04.000
Left.

774
00:54:05.335 --> 00:54:06.625
- Hey!

775
00:54:06.626 --> 00:54:08.042
We did it!

776
00:54:08.043 --> 00:54:09.917
We did it! It's working!

777
00:54:14.335 --> 00:54:15.584
Oh!

778
00:54:28.376 --> 00:54:30.375
- How did you know
what would do that?

779
00:54:30.376 --> 00:54:32.376
- The main metal in
the coin's absomium.

780
00:54:33.418 --> 00:54:34.876
It disrupts magnetic fields.

781
00:54:36.376 --> 00:54:37.793
It's why they
stopped making 'em.

782
00:54:40.751 --> 00:54:42.542
Two outta three?

783
00:54:42.543 --> 00:54:44.543
- No, I'm just gonna
switch it to the other one.

784
00:54:47.085 --> 00:54:48.125
Rebooting.

785
00:54:50.418 --> 00:54:52.084
Restart protocols.

786
00:54:52.085 --> 00:54:54.000
- I knew that.

787
00:54:54.001 --> 00:54:56.834
- I hope Wade has been
taking good care of you.

788
00:54:56.835 --> 00:54:58.084
Did you treat her right?

789
00:54:58.085 --> 00:54:59.543
- A gentleman never tells.

790
00:55:02.418 --> 00:55:03.875
- I bet.

791
00:55:03.876 --> 00:55:05.459
I just wanna let you know

792
00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:07.375
that we're getting close
to our destination.

793
00:55:07.376 --> 00:55:10.084
Once we get the treasures
we seek, we'll let you free.

794
00:55:10.085 --> 00:55:12.417
- That's a load of
shit, and you know it.

795
00:55:12.418 --> 00:55:14.625
- I like your honesty.

796
00:55:14.626 --> 00:55:18.417
So tell me, who's
this lovely lady?

797
00:55:18.418 --> 00:55:19.751
- I think that's her mom.

798
00:55:23.876 --> 00:55:28.543
I just so happen to
have her essence.

799
00:55:35.126 --> 00:55:39.001
- There was a point in my
life this is all I wanted.

800
00:55:41.793 --> 00:55:42.835
I had a wife once.

801
00:55:44.001 --> 00:55:45.418
- You never told me that.

802
00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:49.626
- Well, we all have our secrets.

803
00:55:51.043 --> 00:55:52.793
My family was not
born into wealth.

804
00:55:54.085 --> 00:55:56.042
We were not lucky like you.

805
00:55:56.043 --> 00:55:59.625
When I lost her,
I really lost her.

806
00:55:59.626 --> 00:56:03.626
You see, rich people don't
really know what life is.

807
00:56:05.501 --> 00:56:09.625
You desire something, it's
right at your fingertips,

808
00:56:09.626 --> 00:56:12.875
and you can fix any
mistake you make.

809
00:56:12.876 --> 00:56:14.000
- That's not true.

810
00:56:14.001 --> 00:56:14.835
- Oh, really?

811
00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:17.418
This says different.

812
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:20.875
I assume the captain
was your dad.

813
00:56:20.876 --> 00:56:23.500
And "was" is a key word here,

814
00:56:23.501 --> 00:56:27.042
because he died an
excruciating death.

815
00:56:27.043 --> 00:56:28.959
- I wouldn't be so sure of that.

816
00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:32.501
Unfortunately the
Sadar doesn't have a pod,

817
00:56:34.126 --> 00:56:37.834
and the pod that we captured
you in is in this ship.

818
00:56:41.501 --> 00:56:42.960
Maybe I'll bring your mom back,

819
00:56:45.001 --> 00:56:46.585
and I'll make her my new wife.

820
00:56:56.210 --> 00:56:58.167
Or maybe I'll take you.

821
00:56:58.168 --> 00:57:00.709
- I will die before I let
a creep like you touch me.

822
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:02.542
- Hey!

823
00:57:02.543 --> 00:57:05.043
You will show him the
respect that he deserves.

824
00:57:06.585 --> 00:57:08.105
He's one of the best
men in the galaxy.

825
00:57:09.043 --> 00:57:10.626
Rescued me from Slaver's Bay.

826
00:57:11.626 --> 00:57:13.042
I owe him everything.

827
00:57:13.043 --> 00:57:15.542
- So you traded one
slave life for another?

828
00:57:15.543 --> 00:57:19.042
I am no one's slave.

829
00:57:19.043 --> 00:57:23.500
- Sure you are. You're just
too stupid to realize it.

830
00:57:23.501 --> 00:57:25.001
- Oh, you think
you're tough, huh?

831
00:57:26.543 --> 00:57:29.875
I will slap that grin
right off of your face.

832
00:57:29.876 --> 00:57:31.917
- Oh, I'm sorry.

833
00:57:31.918 --> 00:57:33.543
I don't fight girls.

834
00:57:37.251 --> 00:57:38.543
- I think I'm in love.

835
00:57:41.793 --> 00:57:42.668
- Aw!

836
00:57:44.043 --> 00:57:45.250
Does someone have
a little crush?

837
00:57:45.251 --> 00:57:48.585
Shut up!

838
00:57:51.210 --> 00:57:52.085
- You know,

839
00:57:53.251 --> 00:57:55.917
I take back the creep thing.

840
00:57:55.918 --> 00:57:57.585
You are pretty sexy.

841
00:58:00.668 --> 00:58:02.251
Maybe I'll be your new slave.

842
00:58:16.793 --> 00:58:18.250
- That's enough, Nina.

843
00:58:18.251 --> 00:58:19.626
- No, it's not!

844
00:58:22.001 --> 00:58:23.210
Jesus!

845
00:58:27.210 --> 00:58:29.084
- You're all talk.

846
00:58:29.085 --> 00:58:31.584
Maybe I'll keep you alive
and make you my slave.

847
00:58:31.585 --> 00:58:32.917
- Now you're dreaming.

848
00:58:32.918 --> 00:58:34.667
- Goodnight, sweetheart.

849
00:58:52.126 --> 00:58:53.585
Playtime's over.

850
00:58:58.918 --> 00:59:02.292
Systems alert,
systems alert, systems alert.

851
00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:08.959
- Hey!

852
00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:10.251
Wade, get her!

853
00:59:11.876 --> 00:59:13.835
Nina, come and help me.

854
00:59:20.835 --> 00:59:23.834
Launch sequence activated.

855
00:59:28.085 --> 00:59:30.167
- The pod ejected with
two people inside.

856
00:59:30.168 --> 00:59:31.750
I think Wade double-crossed us.

857
00:59:31.751 --> 00:59:33.250
- Just stay focused.

858
00:59:33.251 --> 00:59:35.084
Engines to speed.

859
00:59:37.251 --> 00:59:38.918
Trajectory calculating.

860
00:59:40.335 --> 00:59:42.834
Warning, warning,
collision alert.

861
00:59:44.751 --> 00:59:47.125
Impact in 30,000 feet.

862
00:59:47.126 --> 00:59:48.126

863

50 meters.

872
01:00:08.001 --> 01:00:09.709
Collision alert.

873
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:10.750

874
01:00:12.668 --> 01:00:13.709
20 meters.

875
01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:15.043
Brace for impact.

876
01:00:27.001 --> 01:00:29.125
Prepare for impact.

877
01:00:57.793 --> 01:00:59.710
Sublight
drives engaged.

878
01:01:01.251 --> 01:01:03.085
Weapons systems armed.

879
01:01:05.001 --> 01:01:06.293
Coordinates locked.

880
01:01:07.335 --> 01:01:08.792
- Everything look good?

881
01:01:08.793 --> 01:01:10.000
- Good enough.

882
01:01:10.001 --> 01:01:11.500
- How are we gonna find them?

883
01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:13.959
- They're on my
ship. It's my home.

884
01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.417
I have a tracking device on it.

885
01:01:15.418 --> 01:01:17.209
- Okay.

886
01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:18.125
- And we also have
something they don't have.

887
01:01:18.126 --> 01:01:19.125
- What?

888
01:01:19.126 --> 01:01:20.043
- Working hyperdrive.

889
01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:33.375
- Want me to track the pod?

890
01:01:33.376 --> 01:01:35.417
- No, we have the beacon.

891
01:01:35.418 --> 01:01:37.209
Check if we can fly.

892
01:01:37.210 --> 01:01:39.210
- All systems seem to be intact.

893
01:01:40.293 --> 01:01:41.418
- I'm coming for you.

894
01:01:44.001 --> 01:01:45.500
Dykstra?

895
01:01:45.501 --> 01:01:47.500
- Elnora, darling.
How are you doing?

896
01:01:47.501 --> 01:01:49.292
- Where's Kip?

897
01:01:49.293 --> 01:01:51.917
- Ah, right to
business as always.

898
01:01:51.918 --> 01:01:55.168
Well we had a little
situation. I took his ship.

899
01:01:56.793 --> 01:01:57.460
- Is he dead?

900
01:02:00.501 --> 01:02:02.125
- That's hard to say.

901
01:02:02.126 --> 01:02:04.000
I left him on board
my ship, though.

902
01:02:04.001 --> 01:02:06.167
His situation was dire.

903
01:02:06.168 --> 01:02:09.792
- I want him dead or alive.

904
01:02:09.793 --> 01:02:12.542
- Fine. I'll send you the
transponder code of my ship.

905
01:02:12.543 --> 01:02:14.001
You can track him down.

906
01:02:15.043 --> 01:02:17.917
But I only ask you one thing.

907
01:02:17.918 --> 01:02:19.334
- What's that?

908
01:02:19.335 --> 01:02:21.209
- If he's still
among the living,

909
01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:23.209
just let him know his
daughter suffered greatly.

910
01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:24.876
- Is she still alive?

911
01:02:28.043 --> 01:02:29.001
- Not for long.

912
01:03:47.501 --> 01:03:49.001
- Hyperdrive disengaged.

913
01:03:51.293 --> 01:03:53.292
Proton-based
life form detected.

914
01:03:53.293 --> 01:03:55.043
- Oh, come on!

915
01:03:56.376 --> 01:03:58.625
- Warning.
- Nav systems down.

916
01:03:58.626 --> 01:04:00.959
- A Zonarapolis space cloud?

917
01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:02.500
I've heard of 'em.
I never saw one.

918
01:04:02.501 --> 01:04:04.125
- We're not going anywhere.

919
01:04:04.126 --> 01:04:06.043
Unless it decides to
move, we're stuck.

920
01:04:07.335 --> 01:04:09.667
- Screw that. I'm gonna
blast our way out.

921
01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:17.335
- Hmm.

922
01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:19.335
Nope.

923
01:04:23.043 --> 01:04:24.417
- Dammit!

924
01:04:24.418 --> 01:04:26.085
- Kip, you bastard.

925
01:04:27.126 --> 01:04:28.335
I'm coming for you.

926
01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:32.500
- I'd like to see you try.

927
01:04:32.501 --> 01:04:34.584
- How dare you speak
to me that way?

928
01:04:34.585 --> 01:04:38.000
- Aw. What are you
gonna do about it?

929
01:04:38.001 --> 01:04:39.376
You'll see soon enough.

930
01:04:41.501 --> 01:04:42.668
- Get ready for takeoff.

931
01:04:46.168 --> 01:04:48.500
- And now you die.

932
01:04:57.001 --> 01:04:58.167
Nav systems up.

933
01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:03.000
- You see, you can't
shoot it from inside,

934
01:05:03.001 --> 01:05:04.585
but outside it's
a different story.

935
01:05:13.418 --> 01:05:17.209
- Huh. Jackie, you
are the greatest.

936
01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:18.750
- Yay.

937
01:05:18.751 --> 01:05:19.750
Let's go.

938
01:05:22.668 --> 01:05:23.543
- No!

939
01:06:27.543 --> 01:06:28.376
- Whoa!

940
01:06:39.126 --> 01:06:41.459
Warning. The
Deepstar is protected property.

941
01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:44.417
You have 30 seconds
to vacate the area.

942
01:06:44.418 --> 01:06:45.626
- No problem.

943
01:06:48.126 --> 01:06:50.084
So much for 30 seconds!

944
01:06:50.085 --> 01:06:52.792
You now have 20
seconds to vacate the area.

945
01:07:00.376 --> 01:07:04.417
You now have 10 seconds
to vacate the area.

946
01:07:04.418 --> 01:07:06.460
Your non-compliance
is unfortunate.

947
01:07:11.418 --> 01:07:13.625
I am now authorized
to take action.

948
01:07:13.626 --> 01:07:14.710
- Hey, rust bucket!

949
01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:19.167
Warning. The
Deepstar is protected property.

950
01:07:28.876 --> 01:07:30.085
- Can I sit?

951
01:07:47.876 --> 01:07:50.709
Why didn't you kill me
when you had the chance?

952
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:51.751
- It's not my style.

953
01:07:53.168 --> 01:07:53.835
- Yeah?

954
01:07:56.501 --> 01:07:59.250
Would you have left Nina
and Dykstra behind, too?

955
01:07:59.251 --> 01:08:00.126
- Yeah.

956
01:08:01.418 --> 01:08:02.917
In pieces.

957
01:08:06.876 --> 01:08:08.168
- Then why me?

958
01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:11.126
- Because we both
suffered the same loss,

959
01:08:12.751 --> 01:08:14.542
and I think,

960
01:08:14.543 --> 01:08:15.418
deep down,

961
01:08:17.210 --> 01:08:18.251
you're a decent guy.

962
01:08:22.376 --> 01:08:24.710
Deep, deep down.

963
01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:31.543
- Hey, I wanna offer you a deal.

964
01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:35.085
We find that treasure,

965
01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:37.335
we split it.

966
01:08:38.835 --> 01:08:40.792
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

967
01:08:40.793 --> 01:08:42.543
Greetings,
my friends.

968
01:08:44.251 --> 01:08:45.168
- Are you injured?

969
01:08:47.793 --> 01:08:48.668
- Who are you?

970
01:08:50.335 --> 01:08:51.875
- We mean you no harm.

971
01:08:51.876 --> 01:08:53.959
- We apologize for the guardian.

972
01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:56.834
It is a defense system
for the Deepstar.

973
01:08:56.835 --> 01:09:00.542
Unfortunately, we are
unable to shut it down.

974
01:09:00.543 --> 01:09:01.959
- You were on the Deepstar?

975
01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:04.418
- Yes. We crashed 20 years ago.

976
01:09:06.918 --> 01:09:08.750
- You don't look like
you've been roughing it.

977
01:09:08.751 --> 01:09:10.500
- Let us take you to our camp.

978
01:09:10.501 --> 01:09:12.126
We'll explain everything there.

979
01:09:13.293 --> 01:09:14.168
- Lead the way.

980
01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:27.793
We have a deal.

981
01:09:59.501 --> 01:10:01.417
So you've lived
here the whole time?

982
01:10:01.418 --> 01:10:02.542
- Yes.

983
01:10:02.543 --> 01:10:03.792
- But it doesn't look like-

984
01:10:03.793 --> 01:10:04.626
- Don't move!

985
01:10:08.626 --> 01:10:10.335
- I'd listen to
her if I was you.

986
01:10:16.793 --> 01:10:20.334
She'd like nothing more than
to blow your brains out.

987
01:10:20.335 --> 01:10:21.335
- Drop your weapon.

988
01:10:22.376 --> 01:10:24.210
Or don't. I'm good either way.

989
01:10:34.043 --> 01:10:36.668
- I knew I could count on you.

990
01:10:41.835 --> 01:10:43.375
So,

991
01:10:43.376 --> 01:10:44.251
tell me,

992
01:10:47.668 --> 01:10:49.875
who are your new friends?

993
01:10:49.876 --> 01:10:52.500
- Survivors of the Deepstar.

994
01:10:52.501 --> 01:10:56.000
- Is that so? Anyone
else survive the crash?

995
01:10:56.001 --> 01:10:56.876
- Just us.

996
01:10:58.710 --> 01:11:00.500
Good, then you can tell
me where the treasure is,

997
01:11:00.501 --> 01:11:03.543
because I looked
all over this dump.

998
01:11:04.543 --> 01:11:05.917
I haven't seen anything.

999
01:11:05.918 --> 01:11:07.668
- We moved the treasure.

1000
01:11:09.626 --> 01:11:10.501
- Where to?

1001
01:11:12.626 --> 01:11:14.042
- In a cave.

1002
01:11:14.043 --> 01:11:15.459
Where is the cave?

1003
01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:17.625
- It's a mile west of here.

1004
01:11:17.626 --> 01:11:19.709
- That's about where
we landed the ship.

1005
01:11:19.710 --> 01:11:20.585
- Good.

1006
01:11:22.585 --> 01:11:24.709
- Let's go for a little walk.

1007
01:11:35.376 --> 01:11:36.750
- Jackie, I want you
to stay with the ship.

1008
01:11:36.751 --> 01:11:38.000
Keep the engines warm.

1009
01:11:38.001 --> 01:11:39.500
- I wanna help you.

1010
01:11:39.501 --> 01:11:41.417
- This is my fight,

1011
01:11:41.418 --> 01:11:43.667
and I need you to keep the
ship ready to blast off.

1012
01:11:43.668 --> 01:11:46.084
- Dykstra's not the type
of guy just to let you go.

1013
01:11:46.085 --> 01:11:47.834
He will come after you.

1014
01:11:47.835 --> 01:11:49.917
- I won't give him
that opportunity.

1015
01:12:00.835 --> 01:12:03.542
- We're the first people you've
seen since you've crashed?

1016
01:12:03.543 --> 01:12:04.460
- That is correct.

1017
01:12:05.585 --> 01:12:06.668
- Why are you so calm?

1018
01:12:07.585 --> 01:12:08.585
- What do you mean?

1019
01:12:10.126 --> 01:12:11.750
- Well, if I hadn't seen another
human in a very long time,

1020
01:12:11.751 --> 01:12:13.959
I'd be overflowing
with excitement.

1021
01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:16.542
I would assume I
was being rescued.

1022
01:12:16.543 --> 01:12:18.667
- What do we need
to be rescued from?

1023
01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:20.584
Well, for starters,

1024
01:12:20.585 --> 01:12:22.545
the three people forcing
us by gunpoint to a cave.

1025
01:12:23.793 --> 01:12:25.584
- There's nothing
to worry about.

1026
01:12:25.585 --> 01:12:28.085
- Everything will be
beautiful. You will see.

1027
01:13:06.835 --> 01:13:08.459
- Why did you stop?

1028
01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:09.543
- We have arrived.

1029
01:13:12.085 --> 01:13:14.000
- Where is the treasure?

1030
01:13:14.001 --> 01:13:14.835
- Right here.

1031
01:13:19.168 --> 01:13:20.460
- I don't see anything.

1032
01:13:23.835 --> 01:13:25.209
Why don't you go and check?

1033
01:13:25.210 --> 01:13:26.584
- You go and check.

1034
01:13:26.585 --> 01:13:28.000
- No, you go and check.

1035
01:13:28.001 --> 01:13:29.668
- Fine.
- You're such a baby.

1036
01:13:34.835 --> 01:13:35.876
There's nothing there.

1037
01:13:37.001 --> 01:13:38.625
Let me see your flashlight.

1038
01:13:39.501 --> 01:13:40.168
- Behold.

1039
01:13:41.210 --> 01:13:43.625
Help! Help me!

1040
01:13:43.626 --> 01:13:45.125
- Bask in its beauty.

1041
01:13:46.126 --> 01:13:47.792
Help! Help me!

1042
01:13:47.793 --> 01:13:50.500
Screw this.

1043
01:13:58.210 --> 01:13:59.085
- Oh god!

1044
01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:04.917
- I am the true treasure
of the universe.

1045
01:14:04.918 --> 01:14:06.876
- What I eat I can become.

1046
01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:10.709
- You should not be afraid.

1047
01:14:10.710 --> 01:14:13.209
The pain is fleeting.

1048
01:14:13.210 --> 01:14:14.418
It is truly

1049
01:14:15.210 --> 01:14:16.126
wonderful.

1050
01:14:17.543 --> 01:14:19.167
Come to us.

1051
01:14:19.168 --> 01:14:20.085
Come to us.

1052
01:14:22.085 --> 01:14:23.292
Come to us!

1053
01:14:23.293 --> 01:14:24.710
Run!

1054
01:14:28.710 --> 01:14:32.584
- Jackie, no matter how
this turns out, thanks.

1055
01:14:32.585 --> 01:14:34.292
- I'm just sorry I
got you in this mess.

1056
01:14:34.293 --> 01:14:36.209
- Don't apologize.

1057
01:14:36.210 --> 01:14:37.917
We made a good team.

1058
01:14:37.918 --> 01:14:39.209
Taylor and I haven't let anybody

1059
01:14:39.210 --> 01:14:40.710
in our lives in a long time.

1060
01:14:41.918 --> 01:14:44.585
I guess you're kind of family.

1061
01:14:50.251 --> 01:14:52.001
How touching.

1062
01:14:53.585 --> 01:14:55.000
- Where's my daughter?

1063
01:14:55.001 --> 01:14:57.542
- Well, I'm afraid
she didn't make it.

1064
01:14:57.543 --> 01:14:58.250
- No!

1065
01:14:59.126 --> 01:15:00.292
- Kip!

1066
01:15:00.293 --> 01:15:01.625
You monster!
- Hey!

1067
01:15:01.626 --> 01:15:03.334
Get us out of here now.

1068
01:15:03.335 --> 01:15:04.334
- Let go of me.

1069
01:15:04.335 --> 01:15:06.126
- Do it or I kill him.

1070
01:15:08.001 --> 01:15:08.876
- Do it.

1071
01:15:11.126 --> 01:15:12.501
Go!

1072
01:15:23.835 --> 01:15:26.959
- You think you
can run from a god?

1073
01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:30.167
I was asleep, but now I'm awake,

1074
01:15:30.168 --> 01:15:31.293
and I'm hungry.

1075
01:15:32.876 --> 01:15:35.750
If it's any solace,
you'll live forever.

1076
01:15:35.751 --> 01:15:37.042
- Is this where I'm
supposed to realize

1077
01:15:37.043 --> 01:15:39.125
immortality is within my reach?

1078
01:15:39.126 --> 01:15:41.209
Succumb to its embrace?

1079
01:15:41.210 --> 01:15:43.210
- Yeah. I'm with her.

1080
01:15:45.126 --> 01:15:46.250
You gotta be out
your fricking mind

1081
01:15:46.251 --> 01:15:48.084
if you have me go back there.

1082
01:15:48.085 --> 01:15:50.125
- It's not about
making you go back.

1083
01:15:50.126 --> 01:15:53.125
It's about giving me
time to come forward.

1084
01:15:58.876 --> 01:16:01.751
Oh god!

1085
01:16:06.001 --> 01:16:09.042
- I spent the last year
searching for the Deepstar.

1086
01:16:09.043 --> 01:16:13.210
A bounty so big that the
entire galaxy could be yours.

1087
01:16:15.835 --> 01:16:17.709
It was all a lie.

1088
01:16:17.710 --> 01:16:19.085
There was no treasure.

1089
01:16:20.168 --> 01:16:22.209
I lost everything.

1090
01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:24.209
- What do you know about loss?

1091
01:16:24.210 --> 01:16:26.375
My daughter was all I had left.

1092
01:16:26.376 --> 01:16:28.085
- You're so melodramatic.

1093
01:16:29.168 --> 01:16:30.875
At least you'll see her soon.

1094
01:16:55.710 --> 01:16:56.875
- It can't get out.

1095
01:16:56.876 --> 01:16:58.292
- Yeah, that's kinda too bad.

1096
01:16:58.293 --> 01:16:59.875
I was kinda hoping
to kick its ass.

1097
01:16:59.876 --> 01:17:01.875
- You wouldn't
have been able to.

1098
01:17:01.876 --> 01:17:03.042
Let's get outta here.

1099
01:17:03.043 --> 01:17:05.210
- You, uh, forgot something.

1100
01:17:07.793 --> 01:17:09.085
You dropped this.

1101
01:17:12.418 --> 01:17:13.917
- What?

1102
01:17:13.918 --> 01:17:15.960
No!

1103
01:17:20.418 --> 01:17:22.000
Why?

1104
01:17:22.001 --> 01:17:24.417
- You didn't let
me finish my story.

1105
01:17:24.418 --> 01:17:27.293
I couldn't stand my
mother's screaming anymore,

1106
01:17:29.418 --> 01:17:30.293
so I,

1107
01:17:31.835 --> 01:17:33.251
I strangled her.

1108
01:17:35.085 --> 01:17:36.710
I was just a kid,

1109
01:17:37.751 --> 01:17:39.126
but it was my first kill.

1110
01:17:40.210 --> 01:17:42.126
I learned it's what I do best.

1111
01:17:43.918 --> 01:17:46.334
I killed my mom.

1112
01:17:46.335 --> 01:17:48.001
Now I killed yours.

1113
01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:51.459
Come on!

1114
01:18:19.210 --> 01:18:20.334
- You.

1115
01:18:20.335 --> 01:18:21.959
- How did you escape?

1116
01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:24.459
- Nothing can quench my
thirst for vengeance.

1117
01:18:24.460 --> 01:18:26.250
Where's Kip?

1118
01:18:26.251 --> 01:18:28.125
- He's busy right now.

1119
01:18:28.126 --> 01:18:31.292
I had hoped to look into
his eyes as the light left.

1120
01:18:31.293 --> 01:18:34.334
Pity. I guess she'll have to do.

1121
01:18:37.376 --> 01:18:38.375
Brace for impact.

1122
01:18:38.376 --> 01:18:39.251
- Ow!

1123
01:18:43.335 --> 01:18:46.000
- That must be Elnora
joining the party.

1124
01:18:46.001 --> 01:18:48.042
- Figures you and Elnora
would know each other.

1125
01:18:48.043 --> 01:18:49.334
- I gave her the
code to my ship,

1126
01:18:49.335 --> 01:18:51.001
knowing she will find your body,

1127
01:18:52.001 --> 01:18:52.835
owe me a favor.

1128
01:18:57.876 --> 01:18:59.292
Don't worry.

1129
01:18:59.293 --> 01:19:01.125
The back of the ship
is impenetrable.

1130
01:19:01.126 --> 01:19:02.834
She'd have to attack
from the side.

1131
01:19:34.918 --> 01:19:37.084
- - Warning.
- Structurally impacts

1132
01:19:37.085 --> 01:19:39.167
Shields at 72%.

1133
01:19:39.168 --> 01:19:40.875
- Can we talk about this?

1134
01:19:40.876 --> 01:19:43.000
- The time for talking is over.

1135
01:19:43.001 --> 01:19:44.917
I will destroy you.

1136
01:19:44.918 --> 01:19:46.459
I will rip your hair out-

1137
01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:47.918
- Okay.
- One by-

1138
01:20:38.085 --> 01:20:39.417
- Okay.

1139
01:20:39.418 --> 01:20:41.292
Let's go.

1140
01:21:27.710 --> 01:21:28.709
Evasive maneuvers.

1141
01:21:28.710 --> 01:21:30.042
- Seriously?

1142
01:21:30.043 --> 01:21:31.500
Shields at 61%.

1143
01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:40.335
- Oh yeah?

1144
01:21:45.001 --> 01:21:45.876
Try this.

1145
01:22:08.168 --> 01:22:10.626
Shields at 54%.

1146
01:22:20.668 --> 01:22:21.710
Shield unstable.

1147
01:22:27.543 --> 01:22:28.709
- I give.

1148
01:22:28.710 --> 01:22:29.542
- And I'll take.

1149
01:22:42.793 --> 01:22:44.709
Shields at 33%

1150
01:22:44.710 --> 01:22:45.585
- Stupid!

1151
01:22:55.751 --> 01:22:57.084
- Okay.

1152
01:22:57.085 --> 01:22:57.960
That's it.

1153
01:23:12.376 --> 01:23:14.626
- Oh. I thought you'd
be able to tell.

1154
01:23:20.543 --> 01:23:22.043
- Time to die, freak.

1155
01:23:29.210 --> 01:23:32.126
- It's not gonna
work without this.

1156
01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:44.375
- Son of a...

1157
01:23:49.126 --> 01:23:51.084
How's that for some action?

1158
01:24:04.668 --> 01:24:06.625
- Shields unstable.
- Jackie.

1159
01:24:06.626 --> 01:24:08.250
- Oh, it's about time.

1160
01:24:08.251 --> 01:24:10.250
Shields at 29%.

1161
01:24:10.251 --> 01:24:11.792
- Elnora?
- Yeah.

1162
01:24:11.793 --> 01:24:13.043
I can't shake her.

1163
01:24:14.126 --> 01:24:16.375
Shields at 11%.

1164
01:24:16.376 --> 01:24:17.792
- Kip.

1165
01:24:17.793 --> 01:24:19.625
So good to see you.

1166
01:24:19.626 --> 01:24:21.750
- Elnora, can we just stop this?

1167
01:24:21.751 --> 01:24:24.750
- You stole something from me.

1168
01:24:24.751 --> 01:24:26.792
I won't stop,

1169
01:24:26.793 --> 01:24:28.292
ever.

1170
01:24:28.293 --> 01:24:29.584
- Okay.

1171
01:24:29.585 --> 01:24:30.460
We'll stop.

1172
01:24:31.335 --> 01:24:32.792
Full stop.

1173
01:24:32.793 --> 01:24:34.709
- Aye aye, captain.

1174
01:24:43.793 --> 01:24:45.667
Shields at 0%.

1175
01:24:45.668 --> 01:24:48.251
- I'm probably gonna feel
really weird about this later,

1176
01:24:49.543 --> 01:24:51.250
but that felt pretty good.

1177
01:25:06.876 --> 01:25:11.542
- Mom?

1178
01:25:11.543 --> 01:25:14.542
- Taylor!

1179
01:25:14.543 --> 01:25:15.625
- Mom?

1180
01:25:15.626 --> 01:25:16.710
- Ah, Taylor!

1181
01:25:23.876 --> 01:25:25.334
- I'm sorry, Mom.

1182
01:25:30.751 --> 01:25:32.251
Dad!

1183
01:25:33.918 --> 01:25:35.375
- Kip, I'm so sorry about-

1184
01:25:35.376 --> 01:25:36.584
- Taylor!

1185
01:25:36.585 --> 01:25:38.500
- What?
- Taylor!

1186
01:25:40.293 --> 01:25:41.375
- Whoa!

1187
01:25:43.918 --> 01:25:46.293
Will you look at that. Hey!

1188
01:25:55.876 --> 01:25:57.251
- Dad.
- Taylor.

1189
01:25:58.210 --> 01:26:00.250
I thought I lost you.

1190
01:26:00.251 --> 01:26:04.376
- I told you, I would never
let that happen again.

1191
01:26:06.293 --> 01:26:08.418
- What happened?
Are you all right?

1192
01:26:10.293 --> 01:26:11.584
- Mom.

1193
01:26:11.585 --> 01:26:13.667
Yes, honey.

1194
01:26:15.918 --> 01:26:17.459
- Lacey!

1195
01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:19.335
- No, that's not her.

1196
01:26:20.418 --> 01:26:21.501
- How is this possible?

1197
01:26:25.376 --> 01:26:26.625
- I failed.

1198
01:26:26.626 --> 01:26:29.000
- Oh, honey, you didn't fail.

1199
01:26:29.001 --> 01:26:31.835
You fought hard, and you won,

1200
01:26:32.876 --> 01:26:34.251
and you didn't give up.

1201
01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:38.834
There isn't much time.

1202
01:26:38.835 --> 01:26:42.542
The monster has never
consumed pure essence before.

1203
01:26:42.543 --> 01:26:44.584
I can feel it fighting.

1204
01:26:44.585 --> 01:26:48.335
It can't control me, so it
will destroy what's left.

1205
01:26:49.418 --> 01:26:50.917
- Can you forgive me Lacey?

1206
01:26:50.918 --> 01:26:52.917
- There's nothing to forgive.

1207
01:26:52.918 --> 01:26:56.417
The most important
thing you've ever done

1208
01:26:56.418 --> 01:26:58.042
lives and breathes.

1209
01:26:58.043 --> 01:27:00.959
You made the right decision
to bring Taylor back.

1210
01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:02.335
It wasn't her time yet.

1211
01:27:03.293 --> 01:27:04.959
- I miss you so much.

1212
01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:08.500
- Someday we'll
be together again.

1213
01:27:08.501 --> 01:27:12.501
I've been watching over
you from a beautiful place,

1214
01:27:13.626 --> 01:27:18.042
a place of love, and
that's all I feel for you.

1215
01:27:18.043 --> 01:27:20.293
There's no sadness. No regret.

1216
01:27:21.668 --> 01:27:24.710
I'll return there
and wait for you.

1217
01:27:25.918 --> 01:27:27.584
- I love you.

1218
01:27:27.585 --> 01:27:29.459
- I love you, Mom.

1219
01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:30.835
- I love you both.

1220
01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:44.418
- What happened?

1221
01:27:45.376 --> 01:27:46.376
- Something.

1222
01:27:48.835 --> 01:27:52.042
Taylor, you remember
when we used to just jump

1223
01:27:52.043 --> 01:27:54.293
in the ship and head
out into deep space?

1224
01:27:55.668 --> 01:27:58.334
- No maps, no plans.

1225
01:27:58.335 --> 01:27:59.543
- Go wherever we want.

1226
01:28:00.585 --> 01:28:02.001
- Back in the game, baby.

1227
01:28:07.876 --> 01:28:09.418
- Is there room for one more?

1228
01:28:10.876 --> 01:28:11.918
Yes. Come on.

1229
01:28:24.418 --> 01:28:27.125
Well, at least we got the parts
we needed from their ship.

1230
01:28:27.126 --> 01:28:28.750
It's gonna be great

1231
01:28:28.751 --> 01:28:30.417
having a working
hyperdrive again.

1232
01:28:30.418 --> 01:28:31.792
Ooh, can I drive?

1233
01:28:31.793 --> 01:28:33.417
Don't touch that.

1234
01:28:33.418 --> 01:28:36.834
Hyperjump
in three, two, one.

1235
01:28:36.835 --> 01:28:40.710
Jackie laughs
