1
00:00:47.083 --> 00:00:49.542
The year is 2980,

2
00:00:49.542 --> 00:00:52.458
and we now know that
death is not the end.

3
00:00:52.458 --> 00:00:55.667
A soul can be extracted
from the recently deceased

4
00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:59.417
and be used to create a
blue liquid called essence.

5
00:00:59.417 --> 00:01:01.375
It can bring a person back to life

6
00:01:01.375 --> 00:01:04.667
in the form of a cyborg-human hybrid.

7
00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:09.417
It's an expensive process
used by the rich and powerful.

8
00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:12.875
The rest, they do what
they can to survive.

9
00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:26.583
Malachi Monroe,

10
00:01:26.583 --> 00:01:28.417
you have been charged with the crime

11
00:01:28.417 --> 00:01:31.500
of interstellar civil disobedience.

12
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.833
How do you plead?

13
00:01:32.833 --> 00:01:34.625
- I didn't do anything wrong.

14
00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:38.625
- I'm afraid your lack
of honesty and remorse

15
00:01:38.625 --> 00:01:43.500
leaves me no choice but to
find you guilty as charged.

16
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.333
But you have the wrong-

17
00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:52.167
- Malachi Monroe,

18
00:01:52.167 --> 00:01:54.750
may the gods have mercy

19
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.792
on your soul.

20
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.417
Kip Corman, you have been charged

21
00:02:18.417 --> 00:02:20.625
with the crime of interstellar theft.

22
00:02:21.542 --> 00:02:22.708
How do you plead?

23
00:02:22.708 --> 00:02:24.333
- The only thing I'm guilty of

24
00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:26.500
is being a better scavenger than you.

25
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.750
- Yet here you are
about to be dropped

26
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.875
in the mouth of a Nolgath.

27
00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:33.958
I find you guilty as charged.

28
00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.917
- Why don't you drop the judge act?

29
00:02:35.917 --> 00:02:37.500
You're a murderous leech

30
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.417
that couldn't even find
the Dolstar Crystal,

31
00:02:39.417 --> 00:02:42.500
even though it was practically
sitting in your own backyard.

32
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.917
- It's a shame your daughter

33
00:02:43.917 --> 00:02:46.625
couldn't be here to see this moment.

34
00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:49.667
When I find her, and I will find her,

35
00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:51.917
she'll suffer the same fate as you.

36
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.667
Any last words?

37
00:03:00.667 --> 00:03:01.708
- I'll see you soon.

38
00:03:03.792 --> 00:03:05.917
- I will tell everyone
that your final words

39
00:03:05.917 --> 00:03:09.417
were incoherent groveling
and begging for your life.

40
00:03:10.417 --> 00:03:11.792
Goodbye, Kip Corman.

41
00:03:33.708 --> 00:03:35.000
No!

42
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.500
- Give me the helm, sweetie.

43
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.458
You cut that pretty
close, don't you think?

44
00:03:41.458 --> 00:03:43.333
- I barely got this running.

45
00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:44.958
I'll need to finish repairs
when we get to the trading post.

46
00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.375
- I got one more thing I gotta do.

47
00:04:41.708 --> 00:04:43.542
- Alert.
Quantum circuit unstable.

48
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.375
Taylor.

49
00:04:47.583 --> 00:04:48.542
What are you doing?

50
00:04:50.458 --> 00:04:51.458
- How'd it go?

51
00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:52.458
- Is this salvageable?

52
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.833
- No.

53
00:04:54.833 --> 00:04:55.708
- Dammit.

54
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.917
- Elnora?

55
00:04:58.917 --> 00:05:00.875
- I swear that woman, she gets
a kick outta screwing with me.

56
00:05:00.875 --> 00:05:02.458
- She owns the only trading post

57
00:05:02.458 --> 00:05:04.792
this side of Wantanian Skytrail.

58
00:05:04.792 --> 00:05:05.917
- So?

59
00:05:05.917 --> 00:05:07.542
- She screws everyone over.

60
00:05:07.542 --> 00:05:08.958
- How's the ship looking? Can we go?

61
00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.875
- The light system is at quarter capacity,

62
00:05:10.875 --> 00:05:13.542
and the hyperdrive is in rough shape.

63
00:05:13.542 --> 00:05:15.042
- How rough?

64
00:05:15.042 --> 00:05:16.917
- We'll be able to make
one jump, but that's it.

65
00:05:16.917 --> 00:05:20.125
We'll need at least five
million credits to fix it.

66
00:05:20.125 --> 00:05:21.000
- Dammit.

67
00:05:22.583 --> 00:05:23.417
- What did we get
for the crystal?

68
00:05:23.417 --> 00:05:24.083
- 500,000.

69
00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:27.458
- Yeah, she totally screwed you.

70
00:05:27.458 --> 00:05:29.083
- Yeah, yeah, she screwed me...

71
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.333
- Dad?

72
00:05:32.125 --> 00:05:33.625
What did you do now?

73
00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:34.750
- I didn't do anything.

74
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.417
There was this coin.

75
00:05:37.417 --> 00:05:38.625
It was like a...

76
00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:40.042
It's, it's-
- Not again.

77
00:05:40.042 --> 00:05:40.750
- She left it out. I
didn't know what it was.

78
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:41.750
- Dad!

79
00:05:44.708 --> 00:05:46.917
Is this a "we should probably
get going" situation,

80
00:05:46.917 --> 00:05:49.000
or a "we should get the
hell outta here" situation?

81
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.875
- You know I don't
like that language

82
00:05:50.875 --> 00:05:52.667
coming out of your mouth.

83
00:05:52.667 --> 00:05:55.750
However, in this situation,
hell is appropriate.

84
00:05:57.792 --> 00:05:59.667
Speak of the devil.

85
00:05:59.667 --> 00:06:02.458
- You must be the dumbest
man in all the galaxy.

86
00:06:02.458 --> 00:06:04.500
I'm not the one who left an artifact

87
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.708
from the Dandolian period sitting out.

88
00:06:06.708 --> 00:06:11.458
- Return the coin at once
or suffer the consequences.

89
00:06:11.458 --> 00:06:13.167
- And what would the consequences be?

90
00:06:13.167 --> 00:06:16.667
- I will tear you limb from limb

91
00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:18.917
and bathe in your blood and your tears.

92
00:06:19.792 --> 00:06:20.708
- Wow.

93
00:06:21.083 --> 00:06:23.125
- That must really mean
something to you, huh?

94
00:06:23.125 --> 00:06:26.458
- It belonged to my
sister before she died.

95
00:06:26.458 --> 00:06:28.792
It was her most prized possession.

96
00:06:30.625 --> 00:06:33.083
- I'm sorry, I didn't
know that. My condolences.

97
00:06:33.083 --> 00:06:34.125
How did she die?

98
00:06:35.625 --> 00:06:36.458
- I killed her.

99
00:06:37.917 --> 00:06:39.583
- Okay.

100
00:06:40.792 --> 00:06:41.667
Blast off.

101
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.875
- Warning.
Unauthorized ignition.

102
00:06:44.875 --> 00:06:46.750
750 Penalty points

103
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.208
- have been applied to
your navigator's license.

104
00:06:48.208 --> 00:06:50.000
- Warning.
Unauthorized liftoff.

105
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.833
Your navigator's license is revoked

106
00:07:02.833 --> 00:07:05.500
by the Department of Space
Vehicles under Code 750 point-

107
00:07:07.083 --> 00:07:09.958
Gravity activated. 
Astrogator engaged.

108
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.500
- What are we gonna do now?

109
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.958
- We gotta find a big
score. Get back on our feet.

110
00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.000
- You shouldn't have
spent everything on-

111
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.167
- Hey, hey, hey.

112
00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.625
Taylor, there's a lot of
things I regret in my life,

113
00:07:28.625 --> 00:07:30.042
but that's not one of 'em.

114
00:07:37.792 --> 00:07:42.042
Remember back in the day,
we'd head out into deep space.

115
00:07:43.542 --> 00:07:44.917
No chart, no plans.

116
00:07:48.083 --> 00:07:50.583
- We never had to worry about credits.

117
00:07:50.583 --> 00:07:52.917
It was just about having fun.

118
00:07:52.917 --> 00:07:54.917
- You said we can
make one more jump.

119
00:07:54.917 --> 00:07:56.583
- Yeah.

120
00:07:56.583 --> 00:07:57.875
- Let's make it and
see where we end up.

121
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.125
- A good old-fashioned adventure.

122
00:08:01.125 --> 00:08:02.083
- Exactly.

123
00:08:08.083 --> 00:08:10.000
Neutrino drive activated.

124
00:08:11.042 --> 00:08:11.917
- Hit it.

125
00:08:13.583 --> 00:08:17.792
Hyperjump in three, two, one.

126
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.542
Hypernavigator calculating.

127
00:08:42.083 --> 00:08:43.958
Come on, let me handle this.

128
00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.917
- I am not going to risk
having to waste credits

129
00:08:46.917 --> 00:08:48.958
to bring you back again.

130
00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.917
- I won't let you down, Mother.

131
00:08:50.917 --> 00:08:52.792
That'll be a first.

132
00:08:52.792 --> 00:08:53.917
Cleanup in Zone 7.

133
00:08:53.917 --> 00:08:55.125
Prisoner secured.

134
00:08:55.125 --> 00:08:57.042
Zone 7 is secured.

135
00:08:57.042 --> 00:09:01.917
- Fine. Assemble a small team
and retrieve that artifact.

136
00:09:01.917 --> 00:09:03.167
- What about Kip?

137
00:09:05.333 --> 00:09:07.250
- Bring him back to me if you can.

138
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:08.542
- And if I can't.

139
00:09:09.917 --> 00:09:11.625
- Do what needs to be done.

140
00:09:12.333 --> 00:09:13.792
- He's as good as dead.

141
00:09:24.625 --> 00:09:26.042
Scanning hyperchannels for tracker.

142
00:09:26.042 --> 00:09:27.625
- I hit them with a tracker.

143
00:09:27.625 --> 00:09:30.083
They did a jump to Sector 63A.

144
00:09:30.083 --> 00:09:31.167
Follow me.

145
00:09:31.167 --> 00:09:32.167
Copy that.

146
00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:38.250
- Oh, I'm so glad I found you.

147
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.625
It's been so lonely

148
00:09:40.625 --> 00:09:42.625
all by myself.

149
00:09:42.625 --> 00:09:44.667
Now will you dance with me?

150
00:09:44.667 --> 00:09:46.667
Just you and me.

151
00:09:55.833 --> 00:09:57.000
Wow.

152
00:10:09.292 --> 00:10:10.167
Oh no.

153
00:10:23.125 --> 00:10:24.083
- And there she is.

154
00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:27.333
- I don't know how she
thought she could escape us.

155
00:10:27.333 --> 00:10:29.167
Docking coordinates locked.

156
00:10:29.167 --> 00:10:30.917
Scanning comms channels.

157
00:10:30.917 --> 00:10:32.250
- Can we link to her comms?

158
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.208
- Negative. She's blocking us.

159
00:10:34.208 --> 00:10:37.375
- All right. Let's knock on the door.

160
00:10:37.375 --> 00:10:38.417
- Okay.

161
00:10:38.417 --> 00:10:40.375
- Hey, a friendly knock.

162
00:10:40.375 --> 00:10:42.125
She's no used to us dead.

163
00:10:42.125 --> 00:10:43.667
- As you wish.

164
00:10:45.208 --> 00:10:47.000
Weapon systems armed.

165
00:10:52.167 --> 00:10:54.125
Station shields disabled.

166
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.875
- Manx, prepare to board the station.

167
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.292
Target detected. Sector 5.

168
00:11:17.875 --> 00:11:19.083
- Can you track that pod?

169
00:11:20.083 --> 00:11:21.083
- Give me a minute.

170
00:11:24.292 --> 00:11:25.917
Honing in on it.

171
00:11:25.917 --> 00:11:27.375
Tracking target.

172
00:11:27.375 --> 00:11:29.042
- Got it.

173
00:11:29.042 --> 00:11:31.417
You can run but you cannot hide.

174
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:42.042
Neutrino core streaming.

175
00:11:42.042 --> 00:11:44.208
Life support steady.

176
00:11:44.208 --> 00:11:46.125
Charging EM batteries.

177
00:11:47.292 --> 00:11:48.333
- We'll get her back.

178
00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.708
- We never should've
been in that sector.

179
00:11:53.083 --> 00:11:54.833
- Well, I forgave
you. Mom will, too.

180
00:11:57.042 --> 00:11:58.292
- I hope so.

181
00:12:07.292 --> 00:12:08.792
Why don't you get some rest?

182
00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:12.958
I'm totally awake.

183
00:12:15.917 --> 00:12:17.167
Maybe a nap will be okay.

184
00:12:18.125 --> 00:12:20.000
- Go on. I got this.

185
00:12:23.792 --> 00:12:24.833
- Love you, Dad.

186
00:12:24.833 --> 00:12:29.833
- I love you, baby.

187
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.875
And I love you.

188
00:12:34.125 --> 00:12:35.208
And I'll get you back.

189
00:13:02.375 --> 00:13:05.375
Goodnight, Mom.

190
00:13:40.083 --> 00:13:42.125
Geoscanning.

191
00:13:42.125 --> 00:13:44.083
Planet profile: Class 1.

192
00:13:44.083 --> 00:13:46.292
And we have arrived.

193
00:13:46.292 --> 00:13:49.208
- Good. I need you to
stay with the ship.

194
00:13:49.208 --> 00:13:51.208
- Oh, let Manx stay.

195
00:13:51.208 --> 00:13:52.417
- I need someone I can trust.

196
00:13:52.417 --> 00:13:54.333
Autopilot engaged.

197
00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:58.000
- Manx is too dumb to even
think about betraying you.

198
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:00.417
Come on, just

199
00:14:01.375 --> 00:14:02.250
let me go.

200
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.167
- Fine, but you cannot
harm this woman in any way.

201
00:14:06.167 --> 00:14:07.583
You understand?

202
00:14:07.583 --> 00:14:08.458
- Aw!

203
00:14:08.458 --> 00:14:10.042
You're no fun.

204
00:14:10.042 --> 00:14:12.083
Approaching target.

205
00:14:12.083 --> 00:14:14.417
- And soon I will have all I desire.

206
00:14:16.542 --> 00:14:19.792
- And what is it that you desire?

207
00:14:22.292 --> 00:14:23.417
- The universe.

208
00:14:35.625 --> 00:14:38.667
- Warning.
Stellastar Station ahead.

209
00:14:48.333 --> 00:14:51.292
- Stellastar, this is Captain
Kip Corman. Are you there?

210
00:14:52.583 --> 00:14:54.125
Scanning for life signs.

211
00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.917
Stellastar, are you in need of assistance?

212
00:15:00.208 --> 00:15:02.167
Weapons scan clear.

213
00:15:07.208 --> 00:15:08.083
- Screw it.

214
00:15:27.667 --> 00:15:28.500
- Dad?

215
00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:32.875
- Good morning, princess.

216
00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:35.542
- Where am I?

217
00:15:37.125 --> 00:15:39.000
- You're in a Class
Six recovery unit.

218
00:15:40.708 --> 00:15:41.583
- Where's Mom?

219
00:15:45.083 --> 00:15:45.958
- Um...

220
00:15:50.042 --> 00:15:50.917
I spent

221
00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.167
everything we had,

222
00:15:54.542 --> 00:15:59.000
but I didn't have enough
to complete the process.

223
00:16:02.542 --> 00:16:03.542
I'm sorry.

224
00:16:40.208 --> 00:16:41.333
- Are we docked?

225
00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:43.292
- Space station floating dark.

226
00:16:43.292 --> 00:16:44.500
- Do they need help?

227
00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.208
- I offered. No reply.

228
00:16:46.208 --> 00:16:47.583
- So it's abandoned?

229
00:16:47.583 --> 00:16:48.750
- Apparently so.

230
00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.125
- You know what that means.

231
00:16:50.125 --> 00:16:51.042
- Back in the game, baby.

232
00:16:51.042 --> 00:16:52.417
- Yeah!

233
00:16:52.417 --> 00:16:54.417
Oh!

234
00:16:54.417 --> 00:16:57.250
The zero gravity stabilization
unit's malfunctioning.

235
00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:58.333
- Can you fix it?

236
00:16:58.333 --> 00:17:00.250
- Not without parts.

237
00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:03.417
- I'm gonna have to manually
rebalance the thermothrusters.

238
00:17:03.417 --> 00:17:05.750
Would you mind doing the
recon yourself, then?

239
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.458
- Of course.

240
00:17:08.792 --> 00:17:10.458
I'll check for parts first in order

241
00:17:10.458 --> 00:17:12.333
to get this old lady
back up and running.

242
00:17:12.333 --> 00:17:15.417
- Hey, she might be old,
but this ain't no lady.

243
00:17:15.417 --> 00:17:17.250
Keep me updated on
what you find, huh?

244
00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:18.625
- Will do.

245
00:17:18.625 --> 00:17:20.375
- Maybe you'll find something cool.

246
00:17:24.125 --> 00:17:26.125
- We're almost there.

247
00:17:46.125 --> 00:17:47.042
- What did he say?

248
00:17:48.458 --> 00:17:49.875
- Something about wanting to die.

249
00:17:49.875 --> 00:17:51.750
- Well, we can be hospitable.

250
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:53.792
Let's honor their request.

251
00:17:53.792 --> 00:17:55.167
Tell them we accept.

252
00:18:00.625 --> 00:18:02.625
There we go!

253
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:50.708
- That was fun.

254
00:18:51.667 --> 00:18:53.458
Let's go.

255
00:19:01.333 --> 00:19:02.750
Mag Locks released.

256
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.458
- Hey, Taylor, any luck over there?

257
00:19:05.458 --> 00:19:07.625
I found some of the parts we need.

258
00:19:07.625 --> 00:19:09.875
- Can you tell what
kind of station it is?

259
00:19:09.875 --> 00:19:13.667
It appears to be a
research station of some sort.

260
00:19:13.667 --> 00:19:15.833
- Galactic or privately owned?

261
00:19:15.833 --> 00:19:19.250
- Definitely private.
There is some contraband.

262
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:20.667
- Anything interesting?

263
00:19:20.667 --> 00:19:22.833
A whole bunch of liquid stuff.

264
00:19:22.833 --> 00:19:25.417
- Ooh. I'll get
a bottle of that.

265
00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:28.375
Make it two.

266
00:19:38.917 --> 00:19:40.958
- Do you think those things took her?

267
00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:41.833
- No.

268
00:19:43.417 --> 00:19:45.417
But you gotta admit,
she's pretty crafty.

269
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.750
- She's still on the station.

270
00:20:17.292 --> 00:20:18.417
- Bless you.
- Thank you.

271
00:20:39.708 --> 00:20:40.583
Hello.

272
00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.958
I'm back on
board. Meet me in the back.

273
00:20:53.833 --> 00:20:54.875
- Stay right there.

274
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.917
- Put the gun away.

275
00:20:57.917 --> 00:21:00.250
You're gonna wanna hear
what she has to say.

276
00:21:01.833 --> 00:21:03.500
- First, we need to get outta
here as soon as possible.

277
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.500
We don't have much time.

278
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.958
- I'm the captain of this ship.

279
00:21:06.958 --> 00:21:08.542
I'll decide what needs to be done.

280
00:21:08.542 --> 00:21:11.000
- Look, I've got 16
million credits on here.

281
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.458
Dad.

282
00:21:13.458 --> 00:21:16.333
- You're lucky. The captain
just decided it's time to go.

283
00:21:17.292 --> 00:21:18.375
- Okay.

284
00:21:22.583 --> 00:21:24.625
Sublight engines online.

285
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.667
- All right, tell me again,
where did you find her?

286
00:21:34.667 --> 00:21:36.708
- She was hiding
in a space suit.

287
00:21:36.708 --> 00:21:37.792
- And you trust her?

288
00:21:37.792 --> 00:21:39.000
- She seems harmless.

289
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.458
- Taylor, that's what you said

290
00:21:40.458 --> 00:21:42.375
about that three-headed baby dragon

291
00:21:42.375 --> 00:21:44.708
that grew into the
destroyer of worlds.

292
00:21:44.708 --> 00:21:47.292
- I don't think we have
to worry about that.

293
00:21:54.583 --> 00:21:55.417
- Hmm.

294
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.667
Scanning for targets.

295
00:22:06.667 --> 00:22:09.333
- Were they worthy opponents?

296
00:22:10.708 --> 00:22:13.750
- No. They weren't much of a challenge.

297
00:22:15.083 --> 00:22:18.958
- Nothing's a challenge
for the mighty Manx.

298
00:22:18.958 --> 00:22:22.583
- I strike fear in the
hearts of those who cross me.

299
00:22:24.708 --> 00:22:26.667
I demand my turn.

300
00:22:26.667 --> 00:22:30.833
I will go on that ship
and kill that woman dead.

301
00:22:30.833 --> 00:22:32.875
- And you were worried about me.

302
00:22:32.875 --> 00:22:33.750
- Sit down!

303
00:22:36.417 --> 00:22:39.750
We can in no way, shape,
or form hurt the woman.

304
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:42.792
You win by bringing
her back to me alive.

305
00:22:45.625 --> 00:22:47.125
- Then I will deliver her to you

306
00:22:48.458 --> 00:22:49.333
alive

307
00:22:50.125 --> 00:22:51.000
and unharmed.

308
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.958
- Okay, talk.

309
00:22:56.958 --> 00:22:58.833
- My name's Jackie.

310
00:22:58.833 --> 00:22:59.917
It's nice to meet you.

311
00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:04.625
Aren't you gonna tell me your name?

312
00:23:04.625 --> 00:23:07.333
I know your daughter's name's
Taylor. She's very pretty.

313
00:23:09.167 --> 00:23:10.542
- Kip.

314
00:23:10.542 --> 00:23:12.083
- Oh, that's a nice name.

315
00:23:12.083 --> 00:23:13.125
Captain Kip.

316
00:23:13.125 --> 00:23:14.542
- Just Kip.

317
00:23:14.542 --> 00:23:15.417
- Yes, sir.

318
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.500
I'm a scientist. I specialize
in celestial cartography.

319
00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:21.875
- Celestial cartography?

320
00:23:21.875 --> 00:23:23.667
- Mm-hmm, it's a branch of cartography

321
00:23:23.667 --> 00:23:26.458
that deals with mapping stars, galaxies,

322
00:23:26.458 --> 00:23:29.000
other astronomical objects
on the celestial sphere.

323
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.667
- Wait, you told
me you were hiding

324
00:23:30.667 --> 00:23:32.500
from some dangerous people.

325
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:36.083
- Yes, Dykstra, the leader
of the group after me.

326
00:23:36.083 --> 00:23:38.500
He read some of my theories
regarding some ships

327
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.875
getting lost in the
Triangulum Rift,

328
00:23:39.875 --> 00:23:41.792
including the legendary Deepstar.

329
00:23:41.792 --> 00:23:43.792
- People have been looking
for the Deepstar for years.

330
00:23:43.792 --> 00:23:45.708
It can't be found.

331
00:23:45.708 --> 00:23:47.625
- That's 'cause they can't
find the distress beacon.

332
00:23:47.625 --> 00:23:50.583
You find the beacon, you
can find the Deepstar.

333
00:23:50.583 --> 00:23:51.792
I know where it is.

334
00:23:52.833 --> 00:23:54.583
It's what brought Dykstra to me.

335
00:23:55.958 --> 00:23:58.500
He said he was part of a private firm

336
00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:59.958
seeking a salvage claim,

337
00:23:59.958 --> 00:24:02.625
and he wanted me to
plot them the course.

338
00:24:02.625 --> 00:24:05.208
Their goal was to find the Deepstar

339
00:24:05.208 --> 00:24:07.875
and claim the vast riches on board.

340
00:24:11.708 --> 00:24:14.958
I started to notice that some
things were off about Dykstra,

341
00:24:14.958 --> 00:24:16.167
and his team.

342
00:24:16.167 --> 00:24:17.833
- What do you mean by off?

343
00:24:17.833 --> 00:24:20.000
- They pretty much kill
everyone they encounter.

344
00:24:20.958 --> 00:24:22.042
And they enjoy it.

345
00:24:24.208 --> 00:24:27.708
I realized that once I found
the Deepstar, I'd be next.

346
00:24:27.708 --> 00:24:31.708
So when we stopped on Dover,
I borrowed a ship and escaped.

347
00:24:31.708 --> 00:24:33.208
- Borrowed?

348
00:24:33.208 --> 00:24:34.417
- Without permission.

349
00:24:35.667 --> 00:24:37.667
I feel bad about it. I do.

350
00:24:37.667 --> 00:24:39.167
The ship was damaged in the escape,

351
00:24:39.167 --> 00:24:41.042
and dead as a 
Carnelian cowerpuss.

352
00:24:41.042 --> 00:24:43.208
- Well, you're lucky you
stumbled upon the station.

353
00:24:43.208 --> 00:24:45.917
- Oh, that wasn't luck. I
worked there 10 years ago.

354
00:24:45.917 --> 00:24:48.542
The lucky part was my
credentials were still valid.

355
00:24:48.542 --> 00:24:51.042
My goal was to get to the
station, borrow another ship,

356
00:24:51.042 --> 00:24:53.083
but the station was empty.

357
00:24:53.083 --> 00:24:55.167
The log said that they
were on a research mission

358
00:24:55.167 --> 00:24:56.917
to the outer rim.

359
00:24:56.917 --> 00:24:59.708
My ship was too damaged
to fix, so I waited,

360
00:24:59.708 --> 00:25:01.458
hoping that someone would show up.

361
00:25:04.083 --> 00:25:05.917
- If we find the Deepstar,

362
00:25:05.917 --> 00:25:08.042
we could get enough
credits to bring Mom back.

363
00:25:10.542 --> 00:25:11.708
- Why do you trust us?

364
00:25:14.917 --> 00:25:16.583
- You haven't tried to kill me.

365
00:25:18.167 --> 00:25:20.208
- Well, what about these
guys you said are after you?

366
00:25:20.208 --> 00:25:21.625
- Oh.

367
00:25:21.625 --> 00:25:23.083
- Don't worry.

368
00:25:23.083 --> 00:25:24.500
I left something for 'em.

369
00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:26.792
- That's my girl.

370
00:25:28.125 --> 00:25:29.875
- Jackie!

371
00:25:29.875 --> 00:25:32.292
It's the mighty Manx!

372
00:25:32.292 --> 00:25:35.250
I am here to return you to Dykstra.

373
00:25:45.292 --> 00:25:46.167
Where are you hiding?

374
00:25:50.958 --> 00:25:51.792
Oh!

375
00:25:56.583 --> 00:25:59.042
- I can't believe you let him go alone.

376
00:26:00.625 --> 00:26:03.208
- Even Manx could not screw this up.

377
00:26:07.833 --> 00:26:08.958
Debris collision.

378
00:26:08.958 --> 00:26:10.875
- What the hell happened?

379
00:26:10.875 --> 00:26:12.125
Well, it couldn't
have been a power surge.

380
00:26:12.125 --> 00:26:13.250
The station was dead.

381
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:14.917
- Dead is what Manx is,

382
00:26:14.917 --> 00:26:17.083
though I will not
share a tear for him.

383
00:26:17.083 --> 00:26:19.667
Jackie, though, we needed her.

384
00:26:19.667 --> 00:26:21.083
- I know.

385
00:26:21.083 --> 00:26:22.375
- Check the ship
and try to find out

386
00:26:22.375 --> 00:26:24.042
what kind of damage we incurred.

387
00:26:25.667 --> 00:26:28.000
- Warning.
Structural impacts.

388
00:26:29.125 --> 00:26:31.000
Systems alert.

389
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.042
Life systems compromised.

390
00:26:33.042 --> 00:26:35.958
- The Deepstar was so close.

391
00:26:37.167 --> 00:26:38.667
I could almost feel it.

392
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:40.750
- There still may be hope.

393
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:42.667
I found something-

394
00:26:42.667 --> 00:26:45.333
- She was the only person who
had any chance of finding it.

395
00:26:45.333 --> 00:26:47.250
- Well if you would let me finish.

396
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:50.000
I found a signal for a ship
that recently left the station.

397
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.375
She may have escaped on it.

398
00:26:52.375 --> 00:26:53.292
- Can you find it?

399
00:26:54.167 --> 00:26:55.042
- Already on it.

400
00:27:02.292 --> 00:27:05.042
Astrocharts calculating.

401
00:27:10.208 --> 00:27:11.208
- Don't touch that.

402
00:27:15.375 --> 00:27:17.083
- Ooh!
- Stop touching things!

403
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:22.833
- Ah.
- Stop!

404
00:27:22.833 --> 00:27:23.708
Please.

405
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:26.750
- Excuse me.

406
00:27:28.875 --> 00:27:30.250
I fixed the turbo thrusters,

407
00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:32.417
but the hyperspeed is still shot.

408
00:27:32.417 --> 00:27:34.292
- Good work.

409
00:27:34.292 --> 00:27:36.208
Sublight incursion.
Proximity alert.

410
00:27:36.208 --> 00:27:38.125
- I think we got company.

411
00:27:43.417 --> 00:27:46.333
- Did you really think you
could run across the galaxy

412
00:27:46.333 --> 00:27:49.125
with my property and
I wouldn't find you?

413
00:27:49.125 --> 00:27:51.333
Tell me that you're not that stupid.

414
00:27:51.333 --> 00:27:52.792
- I'm not that stupid.

415
00:27:54.083 --> 00:27:56.000
- You're in no position to be a smartass.

416
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.917
- Am I a smartass or am I stupid?

417
00:27:57.917 --> 00:28:00.125
You know, you're starting
to sound confused, Elnora.

418
00:28:00.125 --> 00:28:02.875
- I will make you wish
that you were never born!

419
00:28:03.917 --> 00:28:05.833
I will rip out your fleshy parts

420
00:28:05.833 --> 00:28:10.000
and proudly display them
on my desk in a glass jar.

421
00:28:11.875 --> 00:28:15.458
That way, if anyone thinks
of ever crossing me again,

422
00:28:15.458 --> 00:28:18.792
they'll see what lies ahead in their future.

423
00:28:18.792 --> 00:28:20.083
- This is my old boss.

424
00:28:20.083 --> 00:28:22.042
- Oh. Hi, I'm Jackie.

425
00:28:22.042 --> 00:28:22.917
- Shut up!

426
00:28:24.042 --> 00:28:25.958
- She's rude.

427
00:28:25.958 --> 00:28:28.417
- Uh, guys, I would save this
conversation for another time.

428
00:28:28.417 --> 00:28:30.333
Warning. Proximity Alert.

429
00:28:30.333 --> 00:28:31.708
Multiple sectors.

430
00:28:31.708 --> 00:28:32.958
- Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

431
00:28:32.958 --> 00:28:33.708
- Probably not.

432
00:28:33.708 --> 00:28:34.625
- What are we thinking?

433
00:28:35.042 --> 00:28:36.458
- Sit down.

434
00:28:47.208 --> 00:28:51.167
- You will never get away from me,

435
00:28:51.167 --> 00:28:52.792
ever.

436
00:28:52.792 --> 00:28:55.125
We can thank the asteroid field

437
00:28:55.125 --> 00:28:57.000
for that bit of luck.

438
00:28:59.167 --> 00:29:00.958
- What are you waiting for?

439
00:29:00.958 --> 00:29:02.792
- They're entering an asteroid field.

440
00:29:02.792 --> 00:29:04.250
- So what?

441
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.333
- It's too dangerous.
They'll never survive.

442
00:29:06.333 --> 00:29:08.500
- I wouldn't be too sure about that.

443
00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.542
- I'm not scared. I'll go
in there and make you proud.

444
00:29:11.542 --> 00:29:14.833
- I would expect nothing
less of my flesh and blood.

445
00:29:14.833 --> 00:29:16.292
- For the family, I will-

446
00:29:16.292 --> 00:29:18.167
- All right, just get on with it!

447
00:29:27.083 --> 00:29:30.125
Warning. Warning.

448
00:29:35.208 --> 00:29:36.917
Collision imminent.

449
00:29:44.875 --> 00:29:46.500
Hostiles approaching.

450
00:29:51.375 --> 00:29:52.875
- Guys, we have company.

451
00:29:59.875 --> 00:30:02.208
- I order you to support him.

452
00:30:02.208 --> 00:30:03.958
- Are you serious?

453
00:30:03.958 --> 00:30:06.250
- Help him or don't bother coming back.

454
00:30:14.958 --> 00:30:16.208
This was a bad idea.

455
00:30:16.208 --> 00:30:17.583
- Too late now.

456
00:30:29.083 --> 00:30:30.125
He's right on us.

457
00:30:32.375 --> 00:30:34.042
- I can't shake him.

458
00:30:37.125 --> 00:30:38.500
But...

459
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.042
- Warning.
Collision alert.

460
00:30:41.083 --> 00:30:42.583
- I can bake them. You ready?

461
00:30:42.583 --> 00:30:43.875
- Yeah.

462
00:30:43.875 --> 00:30:45.167
- What now?
- Go!

463
00:30:46.333 --> 00:30:48.917
Warning. Warning.

464
00:30:49.875 --> 00:30:51.958
Collision imminent.

465
00:31:03.292 --> 00:31:04.917
- Not again.

466
00:31:08.958 --> 00:31:10.458
- Way to go, Ezekiel!

467
00:31:10.458 --> 00:31:11.958
- Time to get out of here.

468
00:31:16.208 --> 00:31:17.625
- Oh, you did.

469
00:31:18.958 --> 00:31:20.417
- Y'all are nuts!

470
00:31:20.417 --> 00:31:21.625
- Status report.

471
00:31:21.625 --> 00:31:23.958
- The ship has been destroyed.

472
00:31:23.958 --> 00:31:25.458
- Are you sure?

473
00:31:25.458 --> 00:31:27.375
- Yes. There's been
a massive explosion.

474
00:31:28.958 --> 00:31:30.625
- Ezekiel should be
in communication range

475
00:31:30.625 --> 00:31:33.375
on the other side of the
asteroid field momentarily.

476
00:31:40.375 --> 00:31:41.500
- You're alive?

477
00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.167
- And well.

478
00:31:43.167 --> 00:31:45.500
The other ship, I'm afraid,
not so much.

479
00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:49.500
- My son, Ezekiel, was piloting that ship.

480
00:31:53.333 --> 00:31:54.333
- I didn't know that.

481
00:31:56.167 --> 00:31:58.542
From one parent to another,
I'm truly sorry, Elnora.

482
00:31:58.542 --> 00:32:01.333
- Sorry doesn't
replace the credits

483
00:32:01.333 --> 00:32:04.208
I'm going to have to spend
to bring him back again.

484
00:32:04.208 --> 00:32:07.667
- The credits, that's what
you're upset about? The credits?

485
00:32:07.667 --> 00:32:09.500
- Mark my words.

486
00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.333
You will pay!

487
00:32:20.667 --> 00:32:22.667
Rebooting.

488
00:32:22.667 --> 00:32:24.500
- How much damage have we sustained?

489
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.208
- She'll fly, but just barely.

490
00:32:28.208 --> 00:32:29.625
- Well, that's all we need.

491
00:32:29.625 --> 00:32:31.625
Nina is tracking a ship.

492
00:32:34.667 --> 00:32:36.042
- You think she escaped?

493
00:32:36.042 --> 00:32:37.625
- I hope so.

494
00:32:37.625 --> 00:32:40.250
Otherwise all this is for nothing.

495
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:49.708
- You sure it's this one?

496
00:32:49.708 --> 00:32:52.417
- If the coordinates were
input correctly, then yes.

497
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:55.500
- I know why no one's
found the beacon.

498
00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:56.542
- Why?

499
00:32:56.542 --> 00:32:58.000
- This is planet Zeno.

500
00:32:59.375 --> 00:33:01.708
It's also known as a death planet,

501
00:33:01.708 --> 00:33:04.500
rumored to be inhabited by giants.

502
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.458
They'd see us coming
from miles away.

503
00:33:09.333 --> 00:33:10.583
Okay.

504
00:33:13.667 --> 00:33:14.750
- What about the pod?

505
00:33:16.583 --> 00:33:19.292
It's small. It might be able
to slip through undetected.

506
00:33:19.292 --> 00:33:21.250
- It's a delivery system, Taylor.

507
00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:23.250
It's designed to be flown remotely.

508
00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:24.625
- But there are controls.

509
00:33:24.625 --> 00:33:26.250
I've used it before. I can fly it.

510
00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:28.417
- No, no, we're not doing this, okay?

511
00:33:29.583 --> 00:33:31.417
All right. I'll do it.

512
00:33:31.417 --> 00:33:34.458
- No! The controls require
minute adjustments.

513
00:33:34.458 --> 00:33:36.292
You're too heavy handed.

514
00:33:36.292 --> 00:33:37.167
- I'll go.

515
00:33:38.542 --> 00:33:40.750
- It's our best chance
of getting Mom back.

516
00:33:43.417 --> 00:33:45.250
- We're not even sure it's down there.

517
00:33:47.208 --> 00:33:48.500
- May I?

518
00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:49.500
- Go ahead.

519
00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:51.167
- Okay.

520
00:33:51.167 --> 00:33:52.583
We're close enough
now that I think

521
00:33:52.583 --> 00:33:53.500
that we can hear
the distress beacon.

522
00:33:55.458 --> 00:33:57.167
You hear that?

523
00:33:57.167 --> 00:33:58.667
It's there!

524
00:34:01.583 --> 00:34:02.458
- Dad.

525
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:05.042
We have to do it.

526
00:34:07.167 --> 00:34:09.125
- I can't go through it again, Taylor.

527
00:34:13.167 --> 00:34:15.292
- I won't let that happen.

528
00:34:16.417 --> 00:34:17.458
I promise.

529
00:34:21.625 --> 00:34:22.458
- Take a rifle.

530
00:34:23.583 --> 00:34:24.458
- Okay.

531
00:34:52.375 --> 00:34:53.792
Engines to speed.

532
00:34:54.833 --> 00:34:56.750
Trajectory calculating.

533
00:35:13.625 --> 00:35:16.208
- I shouldn't have let her go.

534
00:35:16.208 --> 00:35:18.375
- Do you really think
you could've stopped her?

535
00:35:19.542 --> 00:35:20.375
- No.

536
00:35:23.667 --> 00:35:27.333
- I just can't stand not knowing
what's going on down there.

537
00:35:27.333 --> 00:35:28.417
- She'll be fine.

538
00:35:30.167 --> 00:35:32.250
I can tell, she's special.

539
00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:57.917
- Whoa!

540
00:36:01.708 --> 00:36:03.292
You are a big guy.

541
00:36:07.958 --> 00:36:10.458
Okay, move along, big guy.

542
00:36:30.792 --> 00:36:32.458
Okay, I get it now.

543
00:37:23.667 --> 00:37:24.833
- Who's the picture of?

544
00:37:26.667 --> 00:37:27.792
- That is my wife.

545
00:37:29.417 --> 00:37:30.292
- She's pretty.

546
00:37:32.375 --> 00:37:34.667
I always wanted to be part of a family.

547
00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.958
Where is she?

548
00:37:37.958 --> 00:37:38.833
- She's...

549
00:37:40.833 --> 00:37:42.750
The beacon's moving.

550
00:37:44.542 --> 00:37:46.667
- Ha! That means she has it.

551
00:37:46.667 --> 00:37:47.750
She has it!

552
00:39:16.708 --> 00:39:18.958
Launch sequence activated.

553
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:22.958
Engines to speed.

554
00:39:28.417 --> 00:39:30.083
Trajectory calculating.

555
00:39:35.792 --> 00:39:36.667
- What's going on?

556
00:39:38.042 --> 00:39:39.917
Tractor alert.
Tractor alert.

557
00:39:41.125 --> 00:39:41.958
- Oh no!

558
00:39:47.125 --> 00:39:48.583
- She should be back now.

559
00:39:50.708 --> 00:39:52.792
- The beacon stopped moving.

560
00:39:53.833 --> 00:39:55.458
- Who am I speaking to?

561
00:39:55.458 --> 00:39:57.875
- Captain Kip Corman.
Who are you?

562
00:39:59.708 --> 00:40:01.958
- My name is Dykstra. I'm sure
you've heard about me.

563
00:40:01.958 --> 00:40:03.625
- I have.

564
00:40:03.625 --> 00:40:05.500
- Then you know the position you're in.

565
00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:07.458
I have your woman.

566
00:40:07.458 --> 00:40:11.000
- What I do know is that if
you hurt her, I will kill you.

567
00:40:12.125 --> 00:40:13.958
- I'm not gonna hurt her,

568
00:40:13.958 --> 00:40:16.042
but my friend here,
that's a different story.

569
00:40:16.042 --> 00:40:18.667
All I have to do is snap my finger

570
00:40:19.917 --> 00:40:23.625
and things can get very messy.

571
00:40:24.958 --> 00:40:26.708
I'll make you a trade.

572
00:40:26.708 --> 00:40:28.958
I will dock your ship,

573
00:40:28.958 --> 00:40:31.167
I give you your woman,
you give me mine,

574
00:40:31.167 --> 00:40:33.833
and that's the only offer on the table.

575
00:40:33.833 --> 00:40:36.833
I know I can count on you
to make the right decision.

576
00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.125
- I knew I shouldn't
have let it go.

577
00:40:43.167 --> 00:40:44.875
- It's okay.

578
00:40:44.875 --> 00:40:46.792
I'll go.

579
00:40:46.792 --> 00:40:49.167
- If he's who you say he is,
he'll kill us all regardless.

580
00:40:49.167 --> 00:40:50.125
- So what do we do?

581
00:40:52.042 --> 00:40:53.500
- Kill him first.

582
00:41:16.208 --> 00:41:17.792
Eyes open, Jackie.

583
00:41:23.875 --> 00:41:24.708
Jackie?

584
00:41:42.667 --> 00:41:43.917
- That's enough!

585
00:41:47.167 --> 00:41:49.167
Nina, come and join the party.

586
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:51.583
- Gladly.

587
00:41:52.792 --> 00:41:53.917
- I'm sorry.

588
00:41:53.917 --> 00:41:54.917
- What did you do to her?

589
00:41:54.917 --> 00:41:56.583
- I gave her a sedative.

590
00:41:56.583 --> 00:41:57.958
- Do whatever you want
to me. Just let her go.

591
00:41:57.958 --> 00:41:58.833
- I was gonna.

592
00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:02.667
I'm not the monster
I'm made out to be.

593
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:05.542
But you know, I changed my mind.

594
00:42:05.542 --> 00:42:08.000
You can keep Jackie.
I don't need her.

595
00:42:08.958 --> 00:42:10.750
I have what I need.

596
00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:12.583
- Why did you offer a trade?

597
00:42:12.583 --> 00:42:16.583
Because you have something
really important that I want.

598
00:42:19.833 --> 00:42:21.792
- Don't, don't touch her.

599
00:42:25.667 --> 00:42:28.208
- I don't need her.
I need your ship.

600
00:42:28.208 --> 00:42:30.125
See, this one has seen better days

601
00:42:30.125 --> 00:42:33.625
and it looks like you made
it worse, and for that,

602
00:42:33.625 --> 00:42:36.958
I'm gonna keep this little
pretty thing as payment.

603
00:42:36.958 --> 00:42:38.333
- I'll kill you. I swear to God.

604
00:42:40.208 --> 00:42:41.958
- Famous last words.

605
00:42:44.333 --> 00:42:46.125
Goodbye, Captain.

606
00:42:51.292 --> 00:42:53.792
Hull integrity collapsed.

607
00:42:53.792 --> 00:42:55.292
- What should we do with her?

608
00:42:55.292 --> 00:42:57.333
- Leave her. They
can die together.

609
00:43:00.708 --> 00:43:03.000
A captain is supposed to
go down with his ship.

610
00:43:04.625 --> 00:43:05.917
Lucky for me, this
is your ship now.

611
00:43:19.917 --> 00:43:21.375
- Taylor!

612
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.167
Mom

613
00:43:29.125 --> 00:43:30.000
Taylor!

614
00:43:31.292 --> 00:43:32.833
Taylor!

615
00:43:40.708 --> 00:43:42.000
- Try not to move too much.

616
00:43:43.833 --> 00:43:46.625
Don't worry. Effects of the
medication will soon subside.

617
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.250
- Can I get a swig of that?

618
00:44:18.833 --> 00:44:20.750
You the enforcer of your team?

619
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:22.792
- I'm not part of any team.

620
00:44:22.792 --> 00:44:24.375
- But you're the tough guy, right?

621
00:44:27.083 --> 00:44:28.750
- Yeah.

622
00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:33.750
You could say that.

623
00:44:37.917 --> 00:44:39.333
- Where are you from?

624
00:44:39.333 --> 00:44:40.208
- Jeriba.

625
00:44:42.917 --> 00:44:45.042
- Moon of criminal scum.

626
00:44:46.958 --> 00:44:48.375
- You've been there?

627
00:44:48.375 --> 00:44:49.250
- No.

628
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:52.333
But I've heard stories.

629
00:44:52.333 --> 00:44:54.042
- Yeah.

630
00:44:54.042 --> 00:44:57.167
The stories are pretty
bad, but it's way worse.

631
00:44:58.708 --> 00:45:00.208
Definitely not a place for women.

632
00:45:03.292 --> 00:45:04.125
Maybe Nina.

633
00:45:05.375 --> 00:45:06.875
She'd probably do all right.

634
00:45:11.958 --> 00:45:13.292
My mom tried,

635
00:45:16.917 --> 00:45:17.792
but...

636
00:45:20.833 --> 00:45:22.375
- What happened?

637
00:45:22.375 --> 00:45:23.875
- She got sick.

638
00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:27.125
She used to scream all night long.

639
00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:30.292
The screams still echo in my head.

640
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:37.167
And then she died.

641
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:43.833
- What are you doing
with these criminals?

642
00:45:45.167 --> 00:45:46.000
- I am scum,

643
00:45:47.208 --> 00:45:48.208
just like them.

644
00:45:50.792 --> 00:45:51.458
- No.

645
00:45:53.833 --> 00:45:54.792
You seem different.

646
00:46:02.458 --> 00:46:03.958
- Captain, can you hear me?

647
00:46:06.917 --> 00:46:08.042
Hey.

648
00:46:08.042 --> 00:46:09.333
- How long have I been out?

649
00:46:09.333 --> 00:46:10.292
- An hour or so.

650
00:46:12.875 --> 00:46:16.292
- We got to get the ship up
and running and get after them.

651
00:46:16.292 --> 00:46:17.167
Whoa!

652
00:46:18.917 --> 00:46:20.333
We, uh,

653
00:46:20.333 --> 00:46:22.375
we must have tools and spare parts

654
00:46:22.375 --> 00:46:24.000
somewhere around here, right?

655
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.333
- Yes. I gathered
everything I could find.

656
00:46:26.333 --> 00:46:28.250
- All right, let's get to it.

657
00:46:42.042 --> 00:46:43.875
- This stuff is strong.

658
00:46:43.875 --> 00:46:45.000
- Lightweight.

659
00:46:47.958 --> 00:46:49.375
- You better not try anything.

660
00:46:51.083 --> 00:46:52.875
- I'd like to try a lot of things.

661
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.542
- Well, what are you waiting for?

662
00:47:32.125 --> 00:47:33.125
Tease.

663
00:47:33.125 --> 00:47:34.875
- I will shoot you.

664
00:47:34.875 --> 00:47:38.250
- Yeah, you don't have the balls.

665
00:47:40.875 --> 00:47:41.542
- Oh, I...

666
00:47:43.083 --> 00:47:44.875
I think you need this for it to work.

667
00:47:47.167 --> 00:47:49.042
It's a shame.

668
00:47:49.042 --> 00:47:50.958
I was hoping to get a
little bit of action first.

669
00:47:52.292 --> 00:47:53.125
- Let's go.

670
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.625
- I'm over it, honey.

671
00:47:56.625 --> 00:47:57.458
Maybe later.

672
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.417
- Captain, can I get the slazon, please?

673
00:48:04.417 --> 00:48:05.292
- Got it. Here.

674
00:48:07.625 --> 00:48:08.958
- Thank you.

675
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.875
Whoa, I'm feeling lightheaded.

676
00:48:17.167 --> 00:48:19.042
- We're probably running low on oxygen.

677
00:48:19.042 --> 00:48:20.458
- How much time do we have?

678
00:48:20.458 --> 00:48:21.958
- A ship this size,

679
00:48:21.958 --> 00:48:23.167
well, three hours.

680
00:48:25.042 --> 00:48:27.292
- Why do I feel a but coming?

681
00:48:27.292 --> 00:48:28.958
- Well, the last hour,

682
00:48:28.958 --> 00:48:31.000
the body will be
fighting to stay alive.

683
00:48:32.667 --> 00:48:34.958
Physical activity will be
pretty much nonexistent.

684
00:48:36.333 --> 00:48:38.500
- You coulda just said two hours.

685
00:48:42.667 --> 00:48:44.333
- Your gun wasn't the
only thing I found.

686
00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:54.250
Tell me, does it really bring
people back from the dead?

687
00:48:58.333 --> 00:48:59.542
- A body dies.

688
00:49:01.375 --> 00:49:05.083
Their soul and being can be
kept alive through extraction.

689
00:49:05.083 --> 00:49:08.417
The body, created through
robotics and donor tissue,

690
00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:11.542
is an exact replica.

691
00:49:11.542 --> 00:49:15.333
- A cyborg-human hybrid's
hardly a human being.

692
00:49:15.333 --> 00:49:17.667
- A body isn't what defines a person.

693
00:49:19.458 --> 00:49:24.167
It's their soul, their essence that matters.

694
00:49:24.167 --> 00:49:27.583
- Tell you what, If I ever
run into one of those freaks,

695
00:49:30.042 --> 00:49:32.000
I'll kill it on principle alone.

696
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.208
- How would you even know?

697
00:49:36.208 --> 00:49:37.250
- Oh, I'd know.

698
00:49:41.708 --> 00:49:43.375
- Be careful with that.

699
00:49:43.375 --> 00:49:44.250
- Who is it?

700
00:49:48.167 --> 00:49:49.042
- My mom.

701
00:49:55.583 --> 00:49:56.583
- Well, don't worry.

702
00:49:58.125 --> 00:49:59.667
I'll take good care of her.

703
00:50:05.792 --> 00:50:07.208
Ow!

704
00:50:07.208 --> 00:50:08.083
Dammit!

705
00:50:10.083 --> 00:50:10.958
God!

706
00:50:22.708 --> 00:50:27.667
- You never did finish
telling me about your wife.

707
00:50:27.667 --> 00:50:29.375
Please?

708
00:50:29.375 --> 00:50:30.500
I'd really like to know.

709
00:50:33.625 --> 00:50:37.292
- We were rich and we loved adventures.

710
00:50:37.292 --> 00:50:40.083
We went places we
never should've went.

711
00:50:40.083 --> 00:50:43.292
And I took chances I
shouldn't have taken.

712
00:50:43.292 --> 00:50:45.000
We crashed.

713
00:50:47.542 --> 00:50:48.750
We lost an awful lot.

714
00:50:52.375 --> 00:50:53.625
But I could buy it back.

715
00:50:54.625 --> 00:50:56.417
So I thought.

716
00:50:56.417 --> 00:50:59.542
I didn't realize how
expensive essence was.

717
00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:02.167
I spent everything we had.

718
00:51:03.542 --> 00:51:05.625
Now we do these salvage missions,

719
00:51:05.625 --> 00:51:07.292
hoping to get enough credits to

720
00:51:08.667 --> 00:51:11.542
finish the process of bringing her back.

721
00:51:11.542 --> 00:51:13.375
- You will.

722
00:51:13.375 --> 00:51:15.208
If everything they say
about the Deepstar is true,

723
00:51:15.208 --> 00:51:17.375
you will have so many credits,

724
00:51:17.375 --> 00:51:20.208
you'll have nothing to
worry about ever again.

725
00:51:20.208 --> 00:51:22.208
You'll be set for life.

726
00:51:24.792 --> 00:51:26.833
- All I want is my family back.

727
00:51:28.417 --> 00:51:30.667
- Then let's finish the
repairs and go get them.

728
00:51:48.167 --> 00:51:51.750
I told you I would find the Deepstar.

729
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:53.417
- And I never doubted you.

730
00:51:55.208 --> 00:51:57.250
- That's why you are the only
one I will share it with.

731
00:51:57.250 --> 00:51:58.167
- What about Wade?

732
00:51:59.458 --> 00:52:01.500
- Wade, he's too unstable.

733
00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:02.708
- Hmm.

734
00:52:02.708 --> 00:52:04.375
And when the time comes,

735
00:52:06.417 --> 00:52:08.083
I want you to take care of him.

736
00:52:10.667 --> 00:52:12.208
- Anything for you.

737
00:52:21.708 --> 00:52:23.167
- My son

738
00:52:23.167 --> 00:52:24.750
is dead again

739
00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:25.875
because of you.

740
00:52:25.875 --> 00:52:27.333
- He was a better pilot than me.

741
00:52:27.333 --> 00:52:28.333
- Me too.

742
00:52:28.333 --> 00:52:29.625
- So are you both saying

743
00:52:30.833 --> 00:52:32.667
that my son is dead

744
00:52:32.667 --> 00:52:35.625
because you're both
inadequate with your jobs?

745
00:52:35.625 --> 00:52:37.375
- Yeah, uh, no. I mean, no.

746
00:52:40.958 --> 00:52:43.875
- Ezekiel was the best.

747
00:52:43.875 --> 00:52:45.958
I had no doubt in my mind

748
00:52:45.958 --> 00:52:48.750
that he would complete the mission.

749
00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:51.417
- Are you saying that he failed?

750
00:52:51.417 --> 00:52:52.667
- No. Yes.

751
00:52:57.542 --> 00:52:58.750
- Prepare my ship.

752
00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:01.625
I'll kill Kip myself.

753
00:53:06.833 --> 00:53:09.417
- Well, only one
thing left to do.

754
00:53:10.417 --> 00:53:12.917
- Well, stick it in.

755
00:53:12.917 --> 00:53:16.542
- No, it's not that simple.
It could go in two places.

756
00:53:16.542 --> 00:53:18.792
You put it one place
and it fixes the ship

757
00:53:18.792 --> 00:53:20.667
and it brings the
main power online.

758
00:53:20.667 --> 00:53:23.833
You put it in the other, it
manually starts the hyperdrive,

759
00:53:23.833 --> 00:53:25.375
but if you start the hyperdrive

760
00:53:25.375 --> 00:53:26.917
without being fully powered up,

761
00:53:26.917 --> 00:53:28.958
the ship will be crushed
like an empty can.

762
00:53:28.958 --> 00:53:30.708
- Well, which one does it go in?

763
00:53:30.708 --> 00:53:32.625
- I don't know. Taylor
usually does this stuff.

764
00:53:32.625 --> 00:53:33.958
- Come on.

765
00:53:33.958 --> 00:53:35.875
We're running outta time.

766
00:53:35.875 --> 00:53:38.833
Now we're gonna run into that
hour-long death struggle thing

767
00:53:38.833 --> 00:53:42.667
and I would really like
to avoid that, please.

768
00:53:42.667 --> 00:53:43.542
- All right.

769
00:53:45.667 --> 00:53:46.917
Let's flip a coin.

770
00:53:48.625 --> 00:53:51.292
- That is a Dandolian
Reclam. Where did you get it?

771
00:53:52.292 --> 00:53:53.542
- I borrowed it.

772
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:55.875
Tails.

773
00:54:00.583 --> 00:54:03.958
Left.

774
00:54:05.292 --> 00:54:06.583
- Hey!

775
00:54:06.583 --> 00:54:08.000
We did it!

776
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.875
We did it! It's working!

777
00:54:14.292 --> 00:54:15.542
Oh!

778
00:54:28.333 --> 00:54:30.333
- How did you know
what would do that?

779
00:54:30.333 --> 00:54:32.333
- The main metal in
the coin's absomium.

780
00:54:33.375 --> 00:54:34.833
It disrupts magnetic fields.

781
00:54:36.333 --> 00:54:37.750
It's why they
stopped making 'em.

782
00:54:40.708 --> 00:54:42.500
Two outta three?

783
00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:44.500
- No, I'm just gonna
switch it to the other one.

784
00:54:47.042 --> 00:54:48.083
Rebooting.

785
00:54:50.375 --> 00:54:52.042
Restart protocols.

786
00:54:52.042 --> 00:54:53.958
- I knew that.

787
00:54:53.958 --> 00:54:56.792
- I hope Wade has been
taking good care of you.

788
00:54:56.792 --> 00:54:58.042
Did you treat her right?

789
00:54:58.042 --> 00:54:59.500
- A gentleman never tells.

790
00:55:02.375 --> 00:55:03.833
- I bet.

791
00:55:03.833 --> 00:55:05.417
I just wanna let you know

792
00:55:05.417 --> 00:55:07.333
that we're getting close
to our destination.

793
00:55:07.333 --> 00:55:10.042
Once we get the treasures
we seek, we'll let you free.

794
00:55:10.042 --> 00:55:12.375
- That's a load of shit, and you know it.

795
00:55:12.375 --> 00:55:14.583
- I like your honesty.

796
00:55:14.583 --> 00:55:18.375
So tell me, who's this lovely lady?

797
00:55:18.375 --> 00:55:19.708
- I think that's her mom.

798
00:55:23.833 --> 00:55:28.500
I just so happen to have her essence.

799
00:55:35.083 --> 00:55:38.958
- There was a point in my
life this is all I wanted.

800
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:42.792
I had a wife once.

801
00:55:43.958 --> 00:55:45.375
- You never told me that.

802
00:55:46.417 --> 00:55:49.583
- Well, we all have our secrets.

803
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.750
My family was not born into wealth.

804
00:55:54.042 --> 00:55:56.000
We were not lucky like you.

805
00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.583
When I lost her,
I really lost her.

806
00:55:59.583 --> 00:56:03.583
You see, rich people don't
really know what life is.

807
00:56:05.458 --> 00:56:09.583
You desire something, it's
right at your fingertips,

808
00:56:09.583 --> 00:56:12.833
and you can fix any mistake you make.

809
00:56:12.833 --> 00:56:13.958
- That's not true.

810
00:56:13.958 --> 00:56:14.792
- Oh, really?

811
00:56:15.917 --> 00:56:17.375
This says different.

812
00:56:18.667 --> 00:56:20.833
I assume the captain was your dad.

813
00:56:20.833 --> 00:56:23.458
And "was" is a key word here,

814
00:56:23.458 --> 00:56:27.000
because he died an excruciating death.

815
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.917
- I wouldn't be so sure of that.

816
00:56:28.917 --> 00:56:32.458
Unfortunately the
Sadar doesn't have a pod,

817
00:56:34.083 --> 00:56:37.792
and the pod that we captured
you in is in this ship.

818
00:56:41.458 --> 00:56:42.917
Maybe I'll bring your mom back,

819
00:56:44.958 --> 00:56:46.542
and I'll make her my new wife.

820
00:56:56.167 --> 00:56:58.125
Or maybe I'll take you.

821
00:56:58.125 --> 00:57:00.667
- I will die before I let
a creep like you touch me.

822
00:57:00.667 --> 00:57:02.500
- Hey!

823
00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:05.000
You will show him the
respect that he deserves.

824
00:57:06.542 --> 00:57:07.917
He's one of the best
men in the galaxy.

825
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.583
Rescued me from Slaver's Bay.

826
00:57:11.583 --> 00:57:13.000
I owe him everything.

827
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.500
- So you traded one
slave life for another?

828
00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:19.000
I am no one's slave.

829
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:23.458
- Sure you are. You're just
too stupid to realize it.

830
00:57:23.458 --> 00:57:24.958
- Oh, you think you're tough, huh?

831
00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:29.833
I will slap that grin
right off of your face.

832
00:57:29.833 --> 00:57:31.875
- Oh, I'm sorry.

833
00:57:31.875 --> 00:57:33.500
I don't fight girls.

834
00:57:37.208 --> 00:57:38.500
- I think I'm in love.

835
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:42.625
- Aw!

836
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.208
Does someone have
a little crush?

837
00:57:45.208 --> 00:57:48.542
Shut up!

838
00:57:51.167 --> 00:57:52.042
- You know,

839
00:57:53.208 --> 00:57:55.875
I take back the creep thing.

840
00:57:55.875 --> 00:57:57.542
You are pretty sexy.

841
00:58:00.625 --> 00:58:02.208
Maybe I'll be your new slave.

842
00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:18.208
- That's enough, Nina.

843
00:58:18.208 --> 00:58:19.583
- No, it's not!

844
00:58:21.958 --> 00:58:23.167
Jesus!

845
00:58:27.167 --> 00:58:29.042
- You're all talk.

846
00:58:29.042 --> 00:58:31.542
Maybe I'll keep you alive
and make you my slave.

847
00:58:31.542 --> 00:58:32.875
- Now you're dreaming.

848
00:58:32.875 --> 00:58:34.625
- Goodnight, sweetheart.

849
00:58:52.083 --> 00:58:53.542
Playtime's over.

850
00:58:58.875 --> 00:59:02.250
Systems alert,
systems alert, systems alert.

851
00:59:07.917 --> 00:59:08.917
- Hey!

852
00:59:08.917 --> 00:59:10.208
Wade, get her!

853
00:59:11.833 --> 00:59:13.792
Nina, come and help me.

854
00:59:20.792 --> 00:59:23.792
Launch sequence activated.

855
00:59:28.042 --> 00:59:30.125
- The pod ejected with
two people inside.

856
00:59:30.125 --> 00:59:31.708
I think Wade double-crossed us.

857
00:59:31.708 --> 00:59:33.208
- Just stay focused.

858
00:59:33.208 --> 00:59:35.042
Engines to speed.

859
00:59:37.208 --> 00:59:38.875
Trajectory calculating.

860
00:59:40.292 --> 00:59:42.792
Warning, warning,
collision alert.

861
00:59:44.708 --> 00:59:47.083
Impact in 30,000 feet.

862
00:59:47.083 --> 00:59:48.083
25,000 feet.

863
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.000

00:59:56.917 --> 00:59:57.833

866
00:59:58.792 --> 01:00:00.375
400 meters.

871
01:00:06.792 --> 01:00:07.958
50 meters.

872
01:00:07.958 --> 01:00:09.667
Collision alert.

873
01:00:09.667 --> 01:00:10.708
40 meters.

874
01:00:12.625 --> 01:00:13.667
20 meters.

875
01:00:13.667 --> 01:00:15.000
Brace for impact.

876
01:00:26.958 --> 01:00:29.083
Prepare for impact.

877
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:59.667
Sublight drives engaged.

878
01:01:01.208 --> 01:01:03.042
Weapons systems armed.

879
01:01:04.958 --> 01:01:06.250
Coordinates locked.

880
01:01:07.292 --> 01:01:08.750
- Everything look good?

881
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:09.958
- Good enough.

882
01:01:09.958 --> 01:01:11.458
- How are we gonna find them?

883
01:01:11.458 --> 01:01:13.917
- They're on my ship.
It's my home.

884
01:01:13.917 --> 01:01:15.375
I have a tracking device on it.

885
01:01:15.375 --> 01:01:17.167
- Okay.

886
01:01:17.167 --> 01:01:18.083
- And we also have
something they don't have.

887
01:01:18.083 --> 01:01:19.083
- What?

888
01:01:19.083 --> 01:01:20.000
- Working hyperdrive.

889
01:01:32.167 --> 01:01:33.333
- Want me to track the pod?

890
01:01:33.333 --> 01:01:35.375
- No, we have the beacon.

891
01:01:35.375 --> 01:01:37.167
Check if we can fly.

892
01:01:37.167 --> 01:01:39.167
- All systems seem to be intact.

893
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:41.375
- I'm coming for you.

894
01:01:43.958 --> 01:01:45.458
Dykstra?

895
01:01:45.458 --> 01:01:47.458
- Elnora, darling.
How are you doing?

896
01:01:47.458 --> 01:01:49.250
- Where's Kip?

897
01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:51.875
- Ah, right to business as always.

898
01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:55.125
Well we had a little
situation. I took his ship.

899
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:57.417
- Is he dead?

900
01:02:00.458 --> 01:02:02.083
- That's hard to say.

901
01:02:02.083 --> 01:02:03.958
I left him on board my ship, though.

902
01:02:03.958 --> 01:02:06.125
His situation was dire.

903
01:02:06.125 --> 01:02:09.750
- I want him dead or alive.

904
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:12.500
- Fine. I'll send you the
transponder code of my ship.

905
01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:13.958
You can track him down.

906
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.875
But I only ask you one thing.

907
01:02:17.875 --> 01:02:19.292
- What's that?

908
01:02:19.292 --> 01:02:21.167
- If he's still among the living,

909
01:02:21.167 --> 01:02:23.167
just let him know his
daughter suffered greatly.

910
01:02:23.167 --> 01:02:24.833
- Is she still alive?

911
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:28.958
- Not for long.

912
01:03:47.458 --> 01:03:48.958
- Hyperdrive disengaged.

913
01:03:51.250 --> 01:03:53.250
Proton-based life form detected.

914
01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:55.000
- Oh, come on!

915
01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:58.583
- Warning.
Nav systems down.

916
01:03:58.583 --> 01:04:00.917
- A Zonarapolis space cloud?

917
01:04:00.917 --> 01:04:02.458
I've heard of 'em.
I never saw one.

918
01:04:02.458 --> 01:04:04.083
- We're not going anywhere.

919
01:04:04.083 --> 01:04:06.000
Unless it decides to move, we're stuck.

920
01:04:07.292 --> 01:04:09.625
- Screw that. I'm gonna blast our way out.

921
01:04:16.417 --> 01:04:17.292
- Hmm.

922
01:04:18.417 --> 01:04:19.292
Nope.

923
01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.375
- Dammit!

924
01:04:24.375 --> 01:04:26.042
- Kip, you bastard.

925
01:04:27.083 --> 01:04:28.292
I'm coming for you.

926
01:04:30.417 --> 01:04:32.458
- I'd like to see you try.

927
01:04:32.458 --> 01:04:34.542
- How dare you speak to me that way?

928
01:04:34.542 --> 01:04:37.958
- Aw. What are you gonna do about it?

929
01:04:37.958 --> 01:04:39.333
You'll see soon enough.

930
01:04:41.458 --> 01:04:42.625
- Get ready for takeoff.

931
01:04:46.125 --> 01:04:48.458
- And now you die.

932
01:04:56.958 --> 01:04:58.125
Nav systems up.

933
01:05:00.917 --> 01:05:02.958
- You see, you can't
shoot it from inside,

934
01:05:02.958 --> 01:05:04.542
but outside it's a different story.

935
01:05:13.375 --> 01:05:17.167
- Huh. Jackie, you are the greatest.

936
01:05:17.167 --> 01:05:18.708
- Yay.

937
01:05:18.708 --> 01:05:19.708
Let's go.

938
01:05:22.625 --> 01:05:23.500
- No!

939
01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:28.333
- Whoa!

940
01:06:39.083 --> 01:06:41.417
Warning. The Deepstar is
protected property.

941
01:06:41.417 --> 01:06:44.375
You have 30 seconds to vacate the area.

942
01:06:44.375 --> 01:06:45.583
- No problem.

943
01:06:48.083 --> 01:06:50.042
So much for 30 seconds!

944
01:06:50.042 --> 01:06:52.750
You now have 20
seconds to vacate the area.

945
01:07:00.333 --> 01:07:04.375
You now have 10 seconds
to vacate the area.

946
01:07:04.375 --> 01:07:06.417
Your non-compliance is unfortunate.

947
01:07:11.375 --> 01:07:13.583
I am now authorized to take action.

948
01:07:13.583 --> 01:07:14.667
- Hey, rust bucket!

949
01:07:16.417 --> 01:07:19.125
Warning. The
Deepstar is protected property.

950
01:07:28.833 --> 01:07:30.042
- Can I sit?

951
01:07:47.833 --> 01:07:50.667
Why didn't you kill me
when you had the chance?

952
01:07:50.667 --> 01:07:51.708
- It's not my style.

953
01:07:53.125 --> 01:07:53.792
- Yeah?

954
01:07:56.458 --> 01:07:59.208
Would you have left Nina
and Dykstra behind, too?

955
01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:00.083
- Yeah.

956
01:08:01.375 --> 01:08:02.875
In pieces.

957
01:08:06.833 --> 01:08:08.125
- Then why me?

958
01:08:09.417 --> 01:08:11.083
- Because we both
suffered the same loss,

959
01:08:12.708 --> 01:08:14.500
and I think,

960
01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:15.375
deep down,

961
01:08:17.167 --> 01:08:18.208
you're a decent guy.

962
01:08:22.333 --> 01:08:24.667
Deep, deep down.

963
01:08:28.417 --> 01:08:31.500
- Hey, I wanna offer you a deal.

964
01:08:33.667 --> 01:08:35.042
We find that treasure,

965
01:08:36.417 --> 01:08:37.292
we split it.

966
01:08:38.792 --> 01:08:40.750
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

967
01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:42.500
Greetings, my friends.

968
01:08:44.208 --> 01:08:45.125
- Are you injured?

969
01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:48.625
- Who are you?

970
01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:51.833
- We mean you no harm.

971
01:08:51.833 --> 01:08:53.917
- We apologize for the guardian.

972
01:08:53.917 --> 01:08:56.792
It is a defense system
for the Deepstar.

973
01:08:56.792 --> 01:09:00.500
Unfortunately, we are
unable to shut it down.

974
01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:01.917
- You were on the Deepstar?

975
01:09:01.917 --> 01:09:04.375
- Yes. We crashed 20 years ago.

976
01:09:06.875 --> 01:09:08.708
- You don't look like
you've been roughing it.

977
01:09:08.708 --> 01:09:10.458
- Let us take you to our camp.

978
01:09:10.458 --> 01:09:12.083
We'll explain everything there.

979
01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:14.125
- Lead the way.

980
01:09:26.917 --> 01:09:27.750
We have a deal.

981
01:09:59.458 --> 01:10:01.375
So you've lived here the whole time?

982
01:10:01.375 --> 01:10:02.500
- Yes.

983
01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:03.750
- But it doesn't look like-

984
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:04.583
- Don't move!

985
01:10:08.583 --> 01:10:10.292
- I'd listen to her if I was you.

986
01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:20.292
She'd like nothing more than
to blow your brains out.

987
01:10:20.292 --> 01:10:21.292
- Drop your weapon.

988
01:10:22.333 --> 01:10:24.167
Or don't. I'm good either way.

989
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.625
- I knew I could count on you.

990
01:10:41.792 --> 01:10:43.333
So,

991
01:10:43.333 --> 01:10:44.208
tell me,

992
01:10:47.625 --> 01:10:49.833
who are your new friends?

993
01:10:49.833 --> 01:10:52.458
- Survivors of the Deepstar.

994
01:10:52.458 --> 01:10:55.958
- Is that so? Anyone
else survive the crash?

995
01:10:55.958 --> 01:10:56.833
- Just us.

996
01:10:58.667 --> 01:11:00.458
Good, then you can tell
me where the treasure is,

997
01:11:00.458 --> 01:11:03.500
because I looked
all over this dump.

998
01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:05.875
I haven't seen anything.

999
01:11:05.875 --> 01:11:07.625
- We moved the treasure.

1000
01:11:09.583 --> 01:11:10.458
- Where to?

1001
01:11:12.583 --> 01:11:14.000
- In a cave.

1002
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.417
Where is the cave?

1003
01:11:15.417 --> 01:11:17.583
- It's a mile west of here.

1004
01:11:17.583 --> 01:11:19.667
- That's about where
we landed the ship.

1005
01:11:19.667 --> 01:11:20.542
- Good.

1006
01:11:22.542 --> 01:11:24.667
- Let's go for a little walk.

1007
01:11:35.333 --> 01:11:36.708
- Jackie, I want you
to stay with the ship.

1008
01:11:36.708 --> 01:11:37.958
Keep the engines warm.

1009
01:11:37.958 --> 01:11:39.458
- I wanna help you.

1010
01:11:39.458 --> 01:11:41.375
- This is my fight,

1011
01:11:41.375 --> 01:11:43.625
and I need you to keep the
ship ready to blast off.

1012
01:11:43.625 --> 01:11:46.042
- Dykstra's not the type
of guy just to let you go.

1013
01:11:46.042 --> 01:11:47.792
He will come after you.

1014
01:11:47.792 --> 01:11:49.875
- I won't give him that opportunity.

1015
01:12:00.792 --> 01:12:03.500
- We're the first people you've
seen since you've crashed?

1016
01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:04.417
- That is correct.

1017
01:12:05.542 --> 01:12:06.625
- Why are you so calm?

1018
01:12:07.542 --> 01:12:08.542
- What do you mean?

1019
01:12:10.083 --> 01:12:11.708
- Well, if I hadn't seen another
human in a very long time,

1020
01:12:11.708 --> 01:12:13.917
I'd be overflowing with excitement.

1021
01:12:13.917 --> 01:12:16.500
I would assume I was being rescued.

1022
01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:18.625
- What do we need to be rescued from?

1023
01:12:18.625 --> 01:12:20.542
Well, for starters,

1024
01:12:20.542 --> 01:12:22.417
the three people forcing
us by gunpoint to a cave.

1025
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:25.542
- There's nothing to worry about.

1026
01:12:25.542 --> 01:12:28.042
- Everything will be beautiful.
You will see.

1027
01:13:06.792 --> 01:13:08.417
- Why did you stop?

1028
01:13:08.417 --> 01:13:09.500
- We have arrived.

1029
01:13:12.042 --> 01:13:13.958
- Where is the treasure?

1030
01:13:13.958 --> 01:13:14.792
- Right here.

1031
01:13:19.125 --> 01:13:20.417
- I don't see anything.

1032
01:13:23.792 --> 01:13:25.167
Why don't you go and check?

1033
01:13:25.167 --> 01:13:26.542
- You go and check.

1034
01:13:26.542 --> 01:13:27.958
- No, you go and check.

1035
01:13:27.958 --> 01:13:29.625
- Fine.
You're such a baby.

1036
01:13:34.792 --> 01:13:35.833
There's nothing there.

1037
01:13:36.958 --> 01:13:38.583
Let me see your flashlight.

1038
01:13:39.458 --> 01:13:40.125
- Behold.

1039
01:13:41.167 --> 01:13:43.583
Help! Help me!

1040
01:13:43.583 --> 01:13:45.083
- Bask in its beauty.

1041
01:13:46.083 --> 01:13:47.750
Help! Help me!

1042
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:50.458
Screw this.

1043
01:13:58.167 --> 01:13:59.042
- Oh god!

1044
01:14:01.667 --> 01:14:04.875
- I am the true treasure of the universe.

1045
01:14:04.875 --> 01:14:06.833
- What I eat I can become.

1046
01:14:08.167 --> 01:14:10.667
- You should not be afraid.

1047
01:14:10.667 --> 01:14:13.167
The pain is fleeting.

1048
01:14:13.167 --> 01:14:14.375
It is truly

1049
01:14:15.167 --> 01:14:16.083
wonderful.

1050
01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:19.125
Come to us.

1051
01:14:19.125 --> 01:14:20.042
Come to us.

1052
01:14:22.042 --> 01:14:23.250
Come to us!

1053
01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:24.667
Run!

1054
01:14:28.667 --> 01:14:32.542
- Jackie, no matter how
this turns out, thanks.

1055
01:14:32.542 --> 01:14:34.250
- I'm just sorry I got you in this mess.

1056
01:14:34.250 --> 01:14:36.167
- Don't apologize.

1057
01:14:36.167 --> 01:14:37.875
We made a good team.

1058
01:14:37.875 --> 01:14:39.167
Taylor and I haven't let anybody

1059
01:14:39.167 --> 01:14:40.667
in our lives in a long time.

1060
01:14:41.875 --> 01:14:44.542
I guess you're kind of family.

1061
01:14:50.208 --> 01:14:51.958
How touching.

1062
01:14:53.542 --> 01:14:54.958
- Where's my daughter?

1063
01:14:54.958 --> 01:14:57.500
- Well, I'm afraid she didn't make it.

1064
01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:58.208
- No!

1065
01:14:59.083 --> 01:15:00.250
- Kip!

1066
01:15:00.250 --> 01:15:01.583
You monster!
- Hey!

1067
01:15:01.583 --> 01:15:03.292
Get us out of here now.

1068
01:15:03.292 --> 01:15:04.292
- Let go of me.

1069
01:15:04.292 --> 01:15:06.083
- Do it or I kill him.

1070
01:15:07.958 --> 01:15:08.833
- Do it.

1071
01:15:11.083 --> 01:15:12.458
Go!

1072
01:15:23.792 --> 01:15:26.917
- You think you can run from a god?

1073
01:15:26.917 --> 01:15:30.125
I was asleep, but now I'm awake,

1074
01:15:30.125 --> 01:15:31.250
and I'm hungry.

1075
01:15:32.833 --> 01:15:35.708
If it's any solace,
you'll live forever.

1076
01:15:35.708 --> 01:15:37.000
- Is this where
I'm supposed to realize

1077
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.083
immortality is within my reach?

1078
01:15:39.083 --> 01:15:41.167
Succumb to its embrace?

1079
01:15:41.167 --> 01:15:43.167
- Yeah. I'm with her.

1080
01:15:45.083 --> 01:15:46.208
You gotta be out
your fricking mind

1081
01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:48.042
if you have me go back there.

1082
01:15:48.042 --> 01:15:50.083
- It's not about making you go back.

1083
01:15:50.083 --> 01:15:53.083
It's about giving me
time to come forward.

1084
01:15:58.833 --> 01:16:01.708
Oh god!

1085
01:16:05.958 --> 01:16:09.000
- I spent the last year
searching for the Deepstar.

1086
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.167
A bounty so big that the
entire galaxy could be yours.

1087
01:16:15.792 --> 01:16:17.667
It was all a lie.

1088
01:16:17.667 --> 01:16:19.042
There was no treasure.

1089
01:16:20.125 --> 01:16:22.167
I lost everything.

1090
01:16:22.167 --> 01:16:24.167
- What do you know about loss?

1091
01:16:24.167 --> 01:16:26.333
My daughter was all I had left.

1092
01:16:26.333 --> 01:16:28.042
- You're so melodramatic.

1093
01:16:29.125 --> 01:16:30.833
At least you'll see her soon.

1094
01:16:55.667 --> 01:16:56.833
- It can't get out.

1095
01:16:56.833 --> 01:16:58.250
- Yeah, that's kinda too bad.

1096
01:16:58.250 --> 01:16:59.833
I was kinda hoping to kick its ass.

1097
01:16:59.833 --> 01:17:01.833
- You wouldn't have been able to.

1098
01:17:01.833 --> 01:17:03.000
Let's get outta here.

1099
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.167
- You, uh, forgot something.

1100
01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:09.042
You dropped this.

1101
01:17:12.375 --> 01:17:13.875
- What?

1102
01:17:13.875 --> 01:17:15.917
No!

1103
01:17:20.375 --> 01:17:21.958
Why?

1104
01:17:21.958 --> 01:17:24.375
- You didn't let me finish my story.

1105
01:17:24.375 --> 01:17:27.250
I couldn't stand my
mother's screaming anymore,

1106
01:17:29.375 --> 01:17:30.250
so I,

1107
01:17:31.792 --> 01:17:33.208
I strangled her.

1108
01:17:35.042 --> 01:17:36.667
I was just a kid,

1109
01:17:37.708 --> 01:17:39.083
but it was my first kill.

1110
01:17:40.167 --> 01:17:42.083
I learned it's what I do best.

1111
01:17:43.875 --> 01:17:46.292
I killed my mom.

1112
01:17:46.292 --> 01:17:47.958
Now I killed yours.

1113
01:17:50.417 --> 01:17:51.417
Come on!

1114
01:18:19.167 --> 01:18:20.292
- You.

1115
01:18:20.292 --> 01:18:21.917
- How did you escape?

1116
01:18:21.917 --> 01:18:24.417
- Nothing can quench my
thirst for vengeance.

1117
01:18:24.417 --> 01:18:26.208
Where's Kip?

1118
01:18:26.208 --> 01:18:28.083
- He's busy right now.

1119
01:18:28.083 --> 01:18:31.250
I had hoped to look into
his eyes as the light left.

1120
01:18:31.250 --> 01:18:34.292
Pity. I guess she'll have to do.

1121
01:18:37.333 --> 01:18:38.333
Brace for impact.

1122
01:18:38.333 --> 01:18:39.208
- Ow!

1123
01:18:43.292 --> 01:18:45.958
- That must be Elnora
joining the party.

1124
01:18:45.958 --> 01:18:48.000
- Figures you and Elnora
would know each other.

1125
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.292
- I gave her the
code to my ship,

1126
01:18:49.292 --> 01:18:50.958
knowing she will find your body,

1127
01:18:51.958 --> 01:18:52.792
owe me a favor.

1128
01:18:57.833 --> 01:18:59.250
Don't worry.

1129
01:18:59.250 --> 01:19:01.083
The back of the ship is impenetrable.

1130
01:19:01.083 --> 01:19:02.792
She'd have to attack from the side.

1131
01:19:34.875 --> 01:19:37.042
- - Warning.
Structurally impacts

1132
01:19:37.042 --> 01:19:39.125
Shields at 72%.

1133
01:19:39.125 --> 01:19:40.833
- Can we talk about this?

1134
01:19:40.833 --> 01:19:42.958
- The time for talking is over.

1135
01:19:42.958 --> 01:19:44.875
I will destroy you.

1136
01:19:44.875 --> 01:19:46.417
I will rip your hair out-

1137
01:19:46.417 --> 01:19:47.875
- Okay.
- one by-

1138
01:20:38.042 --> 01:20:39.375
- Okay.

1139
01:20:39.375 --> 01:20:41.250
Let's go.

1140
01:21:27.667 --> 01:21:28.667
Evasive maneuvers.

1141
01:21:28.667 --> 01:21:30.000
- Seriously?

1142
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.458
Shields at 61%.

1143
01:21:39.417 --> 01:21:40.292
- Oh yeah?

1144
01:21:44.958 --> 01:21:45.833
Try this.

1145
01:22:08.125 --> 01:22:10.583
Shields at 54%.

1146
01:22:20.625 --> 01:22:21.667
Shield unstable.

1147
01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:28.667
- I give.

1148
01:22:28.667 --> 01:22:29.500
- And I'll take.

1149
01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:44.667
Shields at 33%

1150
01:22:44.667 --> 01:22:45.542
- Stupid!

1151
01:22:55.708 --> 01:22:57.042
- Okay.

1152
01:22:57.042 --> 01:22:57.917
That's it.

1153
01:23:12.333 --> 01:23:14.583
- Oh. I thought you'd be able to tell.

1154
01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:22.000
- Time to die, freak.

1155
01:23:29.167 --> 01:23:32.083
- It's not gonna work without this.

1156
01:23:43.208 --> 01:23:44.333
- Son of a...

1157
01:23:49.083 --> 01:23:51.042
How's that for some action?

1158
01:24:04.625 --> 01:24:06.583
- Shields unstable.
- Jackie.

1159
01:24:06.583 --> 01:24:08.208
- Oh, it's about time.

1160
01:24:08.208 --> 01:24:10.208
Shields at 29%.

1161
01:24:10.208 --> 01:24:11.750
- Elnora?
- Yeah.

1162
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:13.000
I can't shake her.

1163
01:24:14.083 --> 01:24:16.333
Shields at 11%.

1164
01:24:16.333 --> 01:24:17.750
- Kip.

1165
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:19.583
So good to see you.

1166
01:24:19.583 --> 01:24:21.708
- Elnora, can we just stop this?

1167
01:24:21.708 --> 01:24:24.708
- You stole something from me.

1168
01:24:24.708 --> 01:24:26.750
I won't stop,

1169
01:24:26.750 --> 01:24:28.250
ever.

1170
01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:29.542
- Okay.

1171
01:24:29.542 --> 01:24:30.417
We'll stop.

1172
01:24:31.292 --> 01:24:32.750
Full stop.

1173
01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:34.667
- Aye aye, captain.

1174
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:45.625
Shields at 0%.

1175
01:24:45.625 --> 01:24:48.208
- I'm probably gonna feel
really weird about this later,

1176
01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:51.208
but that felt pretty good.

1177
01:25:06.833 --> 01:25:11.500
- Mom?

1178
01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:14.500
- Taylor!

1179
01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:15.583
- Mom?

1180
01:25:15.583 --> 01:25:16.667
- Ah, Taylor!

1181
01:25:23.833 --> 01:25:25.292
- I'm sorry, Mom.

1182
01:25:30.708 --> 01:25:32.208
Dad!

1183
01:25:33.875 --> 01:25:35.333
- Kip, I'm so sorry about-

1184
01:25:35.333 --> 01:25:36.542
- Taylor!

1185
01:25:36.542 --> 01:25:38.458
- What?
- Taylor!

1186
01:25:40.250 --> 01:25:41.333
- Whoa!

1187
01:25:43.875 --> 01:25:46.250
Will you look at that. Hey!

1188
01:25:55.833 --> 01:25:57.208
- Dad.
- Taylor.

1189
01:25:58.167 --> 01:26:00.208
I thought I lost you.

1190
01:26:00.208 --> 01:26:04.333
- I told you, I would never
let that happen again.

1191
01:26:06.250 --> 01:26:08.375
- What happened?
Are you all right?

1192
01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:11.542
- Mom.

1193
01:26:11.542 --> 01:26:13.625
Yes, honey.

1194
01:26:15.875 --> 01:26:17.417
- Lacey!

1195
01:26:17.417 --> 01:26:19.292
- No, that's not her.

1196
01:26:20.375 --> 01:26:21.458
- How is this possible?

1197
01:26:25.333 --> 01:26:26.583
- I failed.

1198
01:26:26.583 --> 01:26:28.958
- Oh, honey, you didn't fail.

1199
01:26:28.958 --> 01:26:31.792
You fought hard, and you won,

1200
01:26:32.833 --> 01:26:34.208
and you didn't give up.

1201
01:26:36.917 --> 01:26:38.792
There isn't much time.

1202
01:26:38.792 --> 01:26:42.500
The monster has never
consumed pure essence before.

1203
01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:44.542
I can feel it fighting.

1204
01:26:44.542 --> 01:26:48.292
It can't control me, so it
will destroy what's left.

1205
01:26:49.375 --> 01:26:50.875
- Can you forgive me Lacey?

1206
01:26:50.875 --> 01:26:52.875
- There's nothing to forgive.

1207
01:26:52.875 --> 01:26:56.375
The most important
thing you've ever done

1208
01:26:56.375 --> 01:26:58.000
lives and breathes.

1209
01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.917
You made the right decision
to bring Taylor back.

1210
01:27:00.917 --> 01:27:02.292
It wasn't her time yet.

1211
01:27:03.250 --> 01:27:04.917
- I miss you so much.

1212
01:27:04.917 --> 01:27:08.458
- Someday we'll be together again.

1213
01:27:08.458 --> 01:27:12.458
I've been watching over
you from a beautiful place,

1214
01:27:13.583 --> 01:27:18.000
a place of love, and
that's all I feel for you.

1215
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.250
There's no sadness. No regret.

1216
01:27:21.625 --> 01:27:24.667
I'll return there and wait for you.

1217
01:27:25.875 --> 01:27:27.542
- I love you.

1218
01:27:27.542 --> 01:27:29.417
- I love you, Mom.

1219
01:27:29.417 --> 01:27:30.792
- I love you both.

1220
01:27:42.917 --> 01:27:44.375
- What happened?

1221
01:27:45.333 --> 01:27:46.333
- Something.

1222
01:27:48.792 --> 01:27:52.000
Taylor, you remember
when we used to just jump

1223
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.250
in the ship and head
out into deep space?

1224
01:27:55.625 --> 01:27:58.292
- No maps, no plans.

1225
01:27:58.292 --> 01:27:59.500
- Go wherever we want.

1226
01:28:00.542 --> 01:28:01.958
- Back in the game, baby.

1227
01:28:07.833 --> 01:28:09.375
- Is there room for one more?

1228
01:28:10.833 --> 01:28:11.875
Yes. Come on.

1229
01:28:24.375 --> 01:28:27.083
Well, at least we got the parts
we needed from their ship.

1230
01:28:27.083 --> 01:28:28.708
It's gonna be great

1231
01:28:28.708 --> 01:28:30.375
having a working hyperdrive again.

1232
01:28:30.375 --> 01:28:31.750
Ooh, can I drive?

1233
01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:33.375
Don't touch that.

1234
01:28:33.375 --> 01:28:36.792
Hyperjump
in three, two, one.

1235
01:28:36.792 --> 01:28:40.667
Jackie laughs
