00:04:14.892 --> 00:04:16.183
Oh, God. Oh.

2
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.850
- How are you doing, Nick?
- Hi.

3
00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:36.808
Morning, detective.

4
00:04:37.683 --> 00:04:38.850
You got to get back, folks.

5
00:04:39.767 --> 00:04:40.933
- Howdy.
- Morning.

6
00:04:44.267 --> 00:04:45.183
Up there.

7
00:04:50.558 --> 00:04:52.100
- How's it going, guys?
- Morning, Pete.

8
00:04:53.058 --> 00:04:54.267
Who was this fuckin' guy?

9
00:04:54.433 --> 00:04:56.767
Rock and roll, Gus. Johnny Boz.

10
00:04:57.225 --> 00:04:59.142
- I never heard of him.
- Before your time, cowboy.

11
00:04:59.308 --> 00:05:01.350
- Hey, Ronnie. Where are they hiding?
- Upstairs, to the right.

12
00:05:01.767 --> 00:05:05.392
Mid-sixties. He had five or six hits.
He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.

13
00:05:05.558 --> 00:05:06.642
Not now he don't.

14
00:05:09.058 --> 00:05:10.767
- Do we have a time of death.
- Almost.

15
00:05:10.933 --> 00:05:13.142
- You guys know Captain Talcott?
- Sure.

16
00:05:13.433 --> 00:05:15.558
- What's the Chief's office doin' here.
- Observing.

17
00:05:18.683 --> 00:05:19.683
What's it say, doc?

18
00:05:19.933 --> 00:05:22.142
Ninety-two degrees.
It's about six hours.

19
00:05:22.892 --> 00:05:25.225
Puts time of death around,
uh, 2:00 a.m. plus or minus.

20
00:05:25.392 --> 00:05:26.975
Can somebody close the drapes over there?

21
00:05:28.183 --> 00:05:30.058
- Geez, what a mess.
- Maid came in about an hour ago.

22
00:05:30.225 --> 00:05:32.308
Found the body. She's not a live-in.

23
00:05:32.725 --> 00:05:33.683
Maybe the maid did it.

24
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.267
She's 54 years old
and weighs 240 pounds.

25
00:05:36.433 --> 00:05:37.558
No bruises on the body.

26
00:05:38.017 --> 00:05:39.558
- It ain't the maid.
- Never know.

27
00:05:44.225 --> 00:05:45.142
Sorry.

28
00:05:45.725 --> 00:05:47.850
He left the club
with his girlfriend about midnight.

29
00:05:48.017 --> 00:05:49.183
That's the last time anybody saw him.

30
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:50.433
- What was it?
- Ice pick.

31
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.392
Left it on the coffee table
in the living room.

32
00:05:55.558 --> 00:05:57.892
There's cum stains
all over the sheets.

33
00:06:06.433 --> 00:06:07.350
Very impressive.

34
00:06:07.642 --> 00:06:09.225
He got off before he got offed.

35
00:06:09.933 --> 00:06:11.642
Gentlemen, this is sensitive.

36
00:06:11.933 --> 00:06:14.600
Mr. Boz was a major contributor
to the mayor's campaign.

37
00:06:14.767 --> 00:06:16.808
He was Chairman of the Board
of the Palace of Fine Arts--

38
00:06:16.975 --> 00:06:18.767
I thought you said
he was a rock and roll star.

39
00:06:18.933 --> 00:06:21.308
He was a retired rock and roll star.

40
00:06:21.475 --> 00:06:24.600
A civic-minded,
very respectable rock and roll star.

41
00:06:24.767 --> 00:06:25.933
What's that over there?

42
00:06:29.517 --> 00:06:31.892
It looks like some civic-minded,
very respectable cocaine.

43
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.558
Listen to me, Curran.
I'm gonna get a lot of heat on this.

44
00:06:38.308 --> 00:06:39.767
I don't want any mistakes.

45
00:06:45.808 --> 00:06:47.475
What's Boz's girlfriend's name?

46
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.100
Catherine Tramell, 162 Divisadero.

47
00:06:59.517 --> 00:07:00.683
Always a pleasure, Captain.

48
00:07:00.975 --> 00:07:02.433
He's up bright and early.

49
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.517
He doesn't usually punch in
till after his 18 holes.

50
00:07:05.767 --> 00:07:07.433
Johnny and the mayor
must have been very tight.

51
00:07:07.808 --> 00:07:08.850
- Hey.
- Yo.

52
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.475
Keep your three o'clock.

53
00:07:10.975 --> 00:07:11.808
Do you want me to work the case, Phil--

54
00:07:11.975 --> 00:07:13.642
- I said keep it.
- All right.

55
00:07:14.475 --> 00:07:15.350
I'll keep it.

56
00:07:49.267 --> 00:07:51.475
Morning. I'm Detective Curran,
this is Detective Moran.

57
00:07:51.683 --> 00:07:53.475
San Francisco Police Department.

58
00:07:53.725 --> 00:07:55.892
We'd like to speak to
a Ms. Catherine Tramell, please.

59
00:07:57.558 --> 00:07:58.517
Come in.

60
00:08:04.933 --> 00:08:07.100
Sit, please. Just a moment.

61
00:08:13.808 --> 00:08:16.600
Ain't that cute?
They got his and hers Picasso's.

62
00:08:16.933 --> 00:08:18.808
Gus, I didn't even know
you knew who Picasso was.

63
00:08:18.975 --> 00:08:20.392
Sure I do. It says right here.

64
00:08:20.683 --> 00:08:21.808
Hers is bigger.

65
00:08:33.267 --> 00:08:34.183
Sorry to bother you.

66
00:08:34.392 --> 00:08:36.392
Just got a couple of questions to ask.

67
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.975
- Are you vice?
- No, we're homicide.

68
00:08:39.267 --> 00:08:40.225
What do you want?

69
00:08:41.267 --> 00:08:43.642
When was the last time you saw John Boz?

70
00:08:45.058 --> 00:08:45.933
Is he dead?

71
00:08:48.183 --> 00:08:49.517
Why do you think he's dead?

72
00:08:49.933 --> 00:08:52.100
Well, you wouldn't be here
otherwise, would you?

73
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.808
Were you with him last night?

74
00:08:56.392 --> 00:08:57.892
You're looking for Catherine, not me.

75
00:09:01.058 --> 00:09:01.892
Who are you?

76
00:09:02.433 --> 00:09:03.350
I'm Roxy.

77
00:09:05.225 --> 00:09:06.225
I'm her friend.

78
00:09:11.308 --> 00:09:13.308
Well, Roxy, do you know
where your friend is?

79
00:09:15.767 --> 00:09:19.767
She's out at the beach house at Stinson.
Seadrift. 1402.

80
00:09:21.267 --> 00:09:22.600
Thanks.

81
00:09:25.017 --> 00:09:26.433
You're wasting your time.

82
00:09:29.475 --> 00:09:30.892
Catherine didn't kill him.

83
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.225
Gus...

84
00:10:46.725 --> 00:10:47.725
Ms. Tramell?

85
00:11:06.683 --> 00:11:09.350
Good afternoon. I'm Detective Curran,
this is Detective Moran.

86
00:11:09.517 --> 00:11:11.475
- We're with the San Francisco Police--
- I know who you are.

87
00:11:14.725 --> 00:11:15.933
So how did he die?

88
00:11:16.142 --> 00:11:17.142
He was murdered.

89
00:11:17.808 --> 00:11:18.642
Obviously.

90
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.308
- How was he murdered?
- With an ice pick.

91
00:11:26.933 --> 00:11:27.767
How long were you dating him?

92
00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.850
I wasn't dating him. I was fucking him.

93
00:11:35.642 --> 00:11:36.683
What are you? A pro?

94
00:11:38.142 --> 00:11:39.475
No. I'm an amateur.

95
00:11:41.225 --> 00:11:42.892
How long were you having sex with him?

96
00:11:43.517 --> 00:11:44.433
About a year and a half.

97
00:11:45.183 --> 00:11:47.100
- Were you with him last night?
- Yes.

98
00:11:47.558 --> 00:11:48.517
Did you leave the club with him?

99
00:11:48.933 --> 00:11:50.725
- Yes.
- Did you go home with him?

100
00:11:51.058 --> 00:11:54.642
No. We had a drink at the club.
We left together.

101
00:11:55.142 --> 00:11:56.933
He went home and I came out here.

102
00:11:57.142 --> 00:11:59.225
Was there anyone with you last night?

103
00:11:59.767 --> 00:12:02.808
No. I wasn't in the mood last night.

104
00:12:10.808 --> 00:12:12.767
Let me ask you something, Ms. Tramell?

105
00:12:15.017 --> 00:12:16.392
Are you sorry he's dead?

106
00:12:17.558 --> 00:12:20.225
Yeah. I liked fucking him.

107
00:12:26.767 --> 00:12:28.517
Look, I don't really feel
like talking anymore.

108
00:12:30.308 --> 00:12:32.517
Listen, lady,
we can do this downtown if you want.

109
00:12:32.975 --> 00:12:36.517
So read me my rights and arrest me,
and then I'll go downtown.

110
00:12:42.225 --> 00:12:44.100
Otherwise, get the fuck out of here.

111
00:12:52.475 --> 00:12:53.350
Please?

112
00:13:17.683 --> 00:13:18.558
Nice girl.

113
00:13:35.683 --> 00:13:37.558
I'm sorry, Beth. I got hung up in Stinson.

114
00:13:41.142 --> 00:13:42.100
How are you, Nick?

115
00:13:42.767 --> 00:13:43.683
I'm fine.

116
00:13:44.892 --> 00:13:46.350
Oh, come on, Beth. You know I'm fine.

117
00:13:46.558 --> 00:13:47.600
How long we gotta keep doing this?

118
00:13:47.767 --> 00:13:51.267
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to,
I suppose. Have a seat.

119
00:13:51.433 --> 00:13:52.767
It's bullshit, okay. You know it is.

120
00:13:52.933 --> 00:13:57.517
I know it is, but sit down anyway
so we can get it over with, okay?

121
00:14:05.683 --> 00:14:07.975
So, how are things?

122
00:14:09.475 --> 00:14:13.767
Things are fine. I told you, all right.
Things are fine.

123
00:14:14.517 --> 00:14:15.642
How is your personal life?

124
00:14:16.475 --> 00:14:18.100
My sex life is fine.

125
00:14:20.558 --> 00:14:23.350
My sex life is actually pretty shitty
since I stopped seeing you.

126
00:14:28.183 --> 00:14:29.725
Started developing calluses.

127
00:14:34.725 --> 00:14:35.642
Sorry.

128
00:14:38.475 --> 00:14:39.475
How's the booze?

129
00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.558
Haven't had a drink in three months.

130
00:14:42.517 --> 00:14:43.933
- What about the coke?
- No.

131
00:14:44.433 --> 00:14:45.392
No?

132
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.975
No. No, I'm working my ass off,
I'm off the sauce.

133
00:14:49.933 --> 00:14:51.100
I even stopped smoking.

134
00:14:53.392 --> 00:14:54.433
How's not smoking?

135
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.100
It sucks.

136
00:14:58.975 --> 00:15:02.558
Now, will you tell IA I'm just your
average healthy, totally fucked up cop,

137
00:15:03.225 --> 00:15:04.225
and let me outta here?

138
00:15:05.058 --> 00:15:05.975
Please?

139
00:15:12.725 --> 00:15:13.725
Yes.

140
00:15:15.517 --> 00:15:16.475
Thank you.

141
00:15:26.225 --> 00:15:27.475
I still miss you, Nick.

142
00:15:37.308 --> 00:15:38.392
- Hey, how you doing, Nick?
- Hi.

143
00:15:40.392 --> 00:15:42.392
Talcott's in there. They're waiting.
How'd it go?

144
00:15:42.933 --> 00:15:43.850
She misses me.

145
00:15:44.808 --> 00:15:46.558
Boy, when that girl mates, it's for life.

146
00:15:47.475 --> 00:15:49.142
All right. Let's start. Harrigan.

147
00:15:49.475 --> 00:15:52.100
Well, we got
31 stab wounds, neck and the chest.

148
00:15:52.267 --> 00:15:54.808
No usable prints, no forcible entry,
nothing missing.

149
00:15:54.975 --> 00:15:58.267
No prints on the ice pick either.
You can pick it up at any K-mart.

150
00:15:58.808 --> 00:16:01.683
The scarf was Hermes.
It's expensive.

151
00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:04.642
They sell about 20,000 a year, worldwide.

152
00:16:05.017 --> 00:16:07.892
The powder was cocaine,
high- quality, high-content.

153
00:16:08.058 --> 00:16:11.683
He inhaled it; there were
minute quantities on his lips and penis.

154
00:16:12.267 --> 00:16:15.308
Mr. Boz leaves five million dollars,
no direct survivors,

155
00:16:15.517 --> 00:16:16.683
no criminal record.

156
00:16:17.392 --> 00:16:18.975
Liked his drugs, he liked his girls,

157
00:16:19.183 --> 00:16:22.142
- he liked his rock and roll.
- He liked the mayor, too, right?

158
00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:29.517
What about his girlfriend?

159
00:16:29.808 --> 00:16:31.683
Is she relevant here?
Is she a suspect?

160
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:33.933
- She's a suspect.
- On what basis?

161
00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.642
Girlfriend: Catherine Tramell. Age 30.
No priors, no convictions.

162
00:16:37.808 --> 00:16:40.100

00:16:40.308 --> 00:16:42.308

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.517

00:16:45.683 --> 00:16:49.642
killed in a boating accident, 1978,

166
00:16:49.808 --> 00:16:52.433
Estimated assets $110 million.

167
00:16:52.892 --> 00:16:53.683
You're shitting me.

168
00:16:54.683 --> 00:16:57.183
Formerly engaged
to Manual Vasquez, deceased--

169
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:58.642
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Manny Vasquez?

170
00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.017
Manny Vasquez,
former middleweight contender,

171
00:17:01.183 --> 00:17:03.017
killed in the ring Atlantic City, 1984.

172
00:17:04.183 --> 00:17:05.850
I love it.
She's got a hundred million bucks.

173
00:17:06.017 --> 00:17:07.767
She fucks fighters
and rock and roll stars.

174
00:17:07.933 --> 00:17:10.142
And she's got a degree
in screwing with peoples' heads.

175
00:17:10.517 --> 00:17:12.892
You forgot about her degree in literature.
She's a writer.

176
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:15.267
She published a novel last year
under a pen name.

177
00:17:15.433 --> 00:17:16.475
Wanna know what it's about?

178
00:17:18.225 --> 00:17:21.225
It's about a retired rock and roll star
who gets murdered by his girlfriend.

179
00:17:35.058 --> 00:17:36.642
Page 67, cowboy.

180
00:17:37.767 --> 00:17:39.142
You know how she does the boyfriend?

181
00:17:40.183 --> 00:17:41.100
With an icepick...

182
00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:43.475
in bed...

183
00:17:43.975 --> 00:17:46.433
his hands tied with a white silk scarf.

184
00:17:51.808 --> 00:17:52.725
Dr. Garner?

185
00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.350
I've asked Dr. Lamott to consult with us.
This isn't really my turf.

186
00:17:59.017 --> 00:18:02.392
Dr. Lamott teaches the pathology
of psychopathic behavior at Stanford

187
00:18:02.558 --> 00:18:03.308
and is also a member

188
00:18:03.475 --> 00:18:05.558
of the Justice Department's
Psychological Profile team.

189
00:18:06.058 --> 00:18:06.933
Dr. Lamott?

190
00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:11.350
I see two possibilities.

191
00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:15.642
One. The person who wrote this book
is your murderer

192
00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.642
and acted out the killing described
in ritualistic, literal detail.

193
00:18:20.225 --> 00:18:23.225
Two. Someone who wants to harm the writer

194
00:18:23.433 --> 00:18:26.600
read the book and enacted the killing
described to incriminate her.

195
00:18:27.142 --> 00:18:29.183
What if the writer did it?
Then what are we dealing with?

196
00:18:30.517 --> 00:18:32.850
You're dealing with a devious,
diabolical mind.

197
00:18:33.558 --> 00:18:36.600
You see, this book had to have
been written at least six months,

198
00:18:36.767 --> 00:18:39.058
maybe even years, before it was published.

199
00:18:39.808 --> 00:18:41.683
Which means that the writer
had to have at least planned the crime,

200
00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:43.350
in the subconscious, back then.

201
00:18:43.725 --> 00:18:45.558
Now, the fact that she carried it out

202
00:18:45.892 --> 00:18:49.933
indicates psychopathic obsessive behavior
in terms not only of the killing itself,

203
00:18:50.225 --> 00:18:53.142
but also in terms of the applied
advance defense mechanism.

204
00:18:55.183 --> 00:18:57.475
You know,
sometimes I can't tell shit from shinola,

205
00:18:57.683 --> 00:18:58.433
Doc.

206
00:18:59.183 --> 00:19:00.475
What was all that you just said?

207
00:19:00.683 --> 00:19:03.100
- She intended the book to be her alibi.
- Correct.

208
00:19:03.725 --> 00:19:05.933
She's gonna say, "Do you think
I'd be dumb enough to kill anyone

209
00:19:06.142 --> 00:19:07.975
in the exact way I described in my book?

210
00:19:08.642 --> 00:19:10.517
I wouldn't do that,
because then I know I'd be the suspect.”

211
00:19:11.017 --> 00:19:13.142
So what if it's not the writer?
What if it's, uh...

212
00:19:13.308 --> 00:19:14.392
someone who read the book?

213
00:19:16.267 --> 00:19:18.517
You're dealing then
with someone so obsessed

214
00:19:19.183 --> 00:19:23.183
that he, or she, is willing to kill
an irrelevant and innocent victim

215
00:19:23.475 --> 00:19:26.058
in order to place the blame
on the person who wrote that book.

216
00:19:26.725 --> 00:19:29.975
I'm talking about a deep-seeded,
obsessional hatred;

217
00:19:30.517 --> 00:19:32.725
and an utter lack of respect
for human life.

218
00:19:39.517 --> 00:19:42.475
So we got a once-in-a-lifetime,
top-of-the-line

219
00:19:42.683 --> 00:19:45.558
loony-tune either way you cut it.
That's what you're saying, right, Doc?

220
00:19:47.975 --> 00:19:49.850
You're dealing with someone
very dangerous...

221
00:19:51.475 --> 00:19:52.600
and very ill.

222
00:19:58.433 --> 00:20:00.267
Come on, you know
there's no case here.

223
00:20:00.433 --> 00:20:01.975
You've got no physical evidence.

224
00:20:02.225 --> 00:20:03.433
She hasn't got an alibi.

225
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.308
Okay, she hasn't got an alibi,
she hasn't got a motive either.

226
00:20:06.933 --> 00:20:10.517
Believe me. Her defense would just beat us
to death with this copycat thing.

227
00:20:10.683 --> 00:20:12.558
Anybody who read the book
could have done it.

228
00:20:14.308 --> 00:20:16.308
So what do you wanna do now? Nothing?

229
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:18.475
We call her in for questioning.

230
00:20:18.642 --> 00:20:20.642
She's got enough money to burn
this whole department down.

231
00:20:20.808 --> 00:20:23.683
She was the last person
seen with the guy, Captain Talcott.

232
00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:25.267
I'll take the responsibility.

233
00:20:26.808 --> 00:20:27.933
It's yours.

234
00:20:30.892 --> 00:20:34.600
It won't do any good. She'll just waltz in
with some superstar lawyer

235
00:20:34.767 --> 00:20:37.642
who'll get us all canned
for wasting the taxpayer's money.

236
00:20:37.808 --> 00:20:40.100
- That's exactly what she'll do.
- No she won't.

237
00:20:43.017 --> 00:20:44.517
I don't think she'll hide behind anybody.

238
00:20:45.767 --> 00:20:47.142
I don't think she's gonna hide at all.

239
00:20:48.475 --> 00:20:50.558
Then she's as crazy as you are, Curran.

240
00:20:55.683 --> 00:20:59.142
You know what they say:
It takes one to know one.

241
00:21:26.283 --> 00:21:29.617
Ms. Tramell, we like you to come downtown
to answer a few questions for us.

242
00:21:30.408 --> 00:21:31.408
Are you arresting me?

243
00:21:32.783 --> 00:21:33.992
If that's the way you want to play it.

244
00:21:35.658 --> 00:21:37.408
Could I change
into something more appropriate?

245
00:21:38.408 --> 00:21:39.950
It'll only take a minute. Come on in.

246
00:21:44.908 --> 00:21:47.200
Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll be right back.

247
00:22:05.533 --> 00:22:06.575
- Hey, Gus.
- Hmm?

248
00:22:07.075 --> 00:22:08.700
So how long
is this gonna take?

249
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.117
I don't know.

250
00:22:15.575 --> 00:22:17.408
Do you always keep old newspapers around?

251
00:22:18.158 --> 00:22:20.367
Only when they make interesting reading.

252
00:22:36.367 --> 00:22:39.117
- I'm ready.
- You have the right to an attorney.

253
00:22:39.867 --> 00:22:41.158
Why would I need an attorney?

254
00:22:52.283 --> 00:22:53.283
Do you have a cigarette?

255
00:22:53.992 --> 00:22:55.033
I don't smoke.

256
00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:56.450
Yes, you do.

257
00:22:59.158 --> 00:23:01.408
- I quit.
- Congratulations.

258
00:23:13.867 --> 00:23:15.450
Thought you didn't have any cigarettes.

259
00:23:15.867 --> 00:23:17.658
Oh, I found some in my pocket.
Would you like one?

260
00:23:21.825 --> 00:23:23.283
I told you, I quit.

261
00:23:24.367 --> 00:23:25.492
It won't last.

262
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.533
You working on another book?

263
00:23:33.283 --> 00:23:34.242
Yes I am.

264
00:23:35.575 --> 00:23:38.283
It must really be something,
making stuff up all the time.

265
00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.533
Yeah, it teaches you to lie.

266
00:23:42.825 --> 00:23:43.908
How's that?

267
00:23:44.992 --> 00:23:46.783
You make stuff up,
it has to be believable.

268
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:48.825
It's called suspension of disbelief.

269
00:23:49.742 --> 00:23:52.492
I like that. "Suspension of disbelief."

270
00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.158
What's your new book about?

271
00:23:59.992 --> 00:24:02.867
A detective. He falls for the wrong woman.

272
00:24:09.325 --> 00:24:10.325
What happens?

273
00:24:11.033 --> 00:24:11.950
She kills him.

274
00:24:24.492 --> 00:24:26.992
I'm John Correli, Ms. Tramell.
Assistant district attorney.

275
00:24:27.158 --> 00:24:29.158
I have to inform you
this session's beings taped.

276
00:24:29.325 --> 00:24:30.658
This is Captain Talcott.

277
00:24:31.075 --> 00:24:33.617
- My pleasure.
- And Lieutenant Walker.

278
00:24:33.867 --> 00:24:36.242
- Hi.
- Can we get you anything? A cup of coffee?

279
00:24:36.408 --> 00:24:37.367
No, thank you.

280
00:24:37.575 --> 00:24:38.950
Are your attorneys gonna join us?

281
00:24:39.158 --> 00:24:41.283
Ms. Tramell has waived her rights
to an attorney.

282
00:24:45.408 --> 00:24:46.408
Did I miss something?

283
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:49.283
I told them that you wouldn't want
an attorney present.

284
00:24:49.742 --> 00:24:51.158
- Oh.
- Why have you waived your right

285
00:24:51.325 --> 00:24:52.533
to an attorney, Ms. Tramell?

286
00:24:53.658 --> 00:24:55.158
Why did you think I wouldn't want one?

287
00:24:55.575 --> 00:24:57.117
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.

288
00:24:57.992 --> 00:24:59.242
I have nothing to hide.

289
00:25:13.783 --> 00:25:16.325
There is, uh, no smoking
in this building, Ms. Tramell.

290
00:25:18.158 --> 00:25:20.283
What are you going to do?
Charge me with smoking?

291
00:25:34.075 --> 00:25:36.700
Would you tell us the nature
of your relationship with Mr. Boz?

292
00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.075
I had sex with him for about
a year and a half.

293
00:25:41.575 --> 00:25:42.992
I liked having sex with him.

294
00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:46.325
He wasn't afraid of experimenting.

295
00:25:48.742 --> 00:25:49.992
I like men like that.

296
00:25:51.283 --> 00:25:52.450
Men who give me pleasure.

297
00:25:55.492 --> 00:25:56.867
He gave me a lot of pleasure.

298
00:26:01.658 --> 00:26:02.658
You ever, uh...

299
00:26:03.658 --> 00:26:07.033
engage in any sado-masochistic activity?

300
00:26:08.783 --> 00:26:11.408
Exactly what did you have in mind,
Mr. Correli?

301
00:26:14.658 --> 00:26:16.492
- Did you ever tie him up?
- No.

302
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:17.950
You never tied him up.

303
00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:19.450
No.

304
00:26:20.117 --> 00:26:21.950
Johnny liked to use his hands too much.

305
00:26:22.867 --> 00:26:24.242
I like hands and fingers.

306
00:26:27.117 --> 00:26:30.325
You describe a, uh,
white silk scarf in your book.

307
00:26:30.742 --> 00:26:33.033
I've always had a fondness
for white silk scarves.

308
00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.033
They're good for all occasions.

309
00:26:35.908 --> 00:26:37.700
But you said you liked men
to use their hands.

310
00:26:37.908 --> 00:26:38.825
- Didn't you?
- No.

311
00:26:38.992 --> 00:26:41.408
I said I liked Johnny to use his hands

312
00:26:44.075 --> 00:26:47.242
I don't make any rules, Nick.
I go with the flow.

313
00:26:49.658 --> 00:26:51.450
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?

314
00:26:52.117 --> 00:26:54.408
I'd have to be pretty stupid
to write a book about a killing

315
00:26:54.575 --> 00:26:57.117
and then kill somebody the way
I described it in my book.

316
00:26:57.533 --> 00:26:59.367
I'd be announcing myself as the killer.

317
00:27:00.117 --> 00:27:00.992
I'm not stupid.

318
00:27:01.575 --> 00:27:03.200
We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.

319
00:27:03.367 --> 00:27:05.200
Maybe that's what you're counting on
to get you off the hook.

320
00:27:05.408 --> 00:27:07.075
Writing the book gives you an alibi.

321
00:27:07.283 --> 00:27:08.783
Yes it does, doesn't it?

322
00:27:11.867 --> 00:27:14.950
The answer is no. I didn't kill him.

323
00:27:18.075 --> 00:27:19.742
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?

324
00:27:20.242 --> 00:27:22.950
- Sometimes.
- Did you ever do drugs with Mr. Boz?

325
00:27:23.325 --> 00:27:25.450
- Sure.
- What kind of drugs?

326
00:27:26.033 --> 00:27:26.950
Cocaine.

327
00:27:27.908 --> 00:27:29.700
Have you ever fucked on cocaine, Nick?

328
00:27:44.658 --> 00:27:45.617
It's nice.

329
00:27:57.325 --> 00:27:59.367
You like playing games, don't you?

330
00:27:59.575 --> 00:28:03.867
I have a degree in psychology.
It goes with the turf. Games are fun.

331
00:28:04.742 --> 00:28:07.825
How about boxing? That's a game.
Was that fun too?

332
00:28:07.992 --> 00:28:09.867
I don't think that's relevant
to this inquiry.

333
00:28:11.825 --> 00:28:13.700
Boxing was fun till Manny died.

334
00:28:15.325 --> 00:28:16.575
How did you feel when he died?

335
00:28:17.075 --> 00:28:18.200
I loved him. It hurt.

336
00:28:18.617 --> 00:28:20.617
How did you feel when I told you
Johnny Boz had died?

337
00:28:22.283 --> 00:28:24.575
I felt like someone who read my book,
and was playing a game.

338
00:28:24.742 --> 00:28:26.033
- But it didn't hurt?
- No.

339
00:28:26.242 --> 00:28:27.658
Because you didn't love him...
That's right.

340
00:28:27.825 --> 00:28:29.033
...even though you were fucking him.

341
00:28:29.242 --> 00:28:30.450
You still get the pleasure.

342
00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.867
Didn't you ever fuck anybody else
when you were married, Nick?

343
00:28:34.575 --> 00:28:35.575
How did you know he was married?

344
00:28:36.408 --> 00:28:37.950
Maybe I was just guessing.

345
00:28:38.617 --> 00:28:39.783
What difference does it make?

346
00:28:44.742 --> 00:28:45.783
Would you like a cigarette, Nick?

347
00:28:53.908 --> 00:28:55.408
- You two know each other?
- No.

348
00:28:56.325 --> 00:28:57.242
No.

349
00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:01.867
How did you meet Mr. Boz?

350
00:29:02.242 --> 00:29:05.200
I wanted to write a book about the murder
of a retired rock and roll star.

351
00:29:05.783 --> 00:29:09.200
I went down to his club, I picked him up.
Then I had sex with him.

352
00:29:11.617 --> 00:29:14.533
You didn't feel anything for him.
You just had sex with him for your book.

353
00:29:14.908 --> 00:29:18.200
In the beginning.
Then I got to like what he did for me.

354
00:29:20.367 --> 00:29:22.158
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?

355
00:29:22.783 --> 00:29:24.867
I'm a writer, I use people
for what I write.

356
00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:26.575
Let the world beware.

357
00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.450
You want me to take a lie detector test?

358
00:29:42.117 --> 00:29:42.825
Wait here, please.

359
00:29:50.867 --> 00:29:53.700
No blips, no blood pressure variations,
no pulse variance.

360
00:29:53.867 --> 00:29:56.700
Either she's telling the truth
or I've never seen anyone like her.

361
00:29:59.658 --> 00:30:00.908
I guess that settles it.

362
00:30:04.575 --> 00:30:06.658
- She's lying.
- Forget it. You can fool me.

363
00:30:06.825 --> 00:30:09.033
-You cannot fool the machine.
-Trust me. It can be done.

364
00:30:09.242 --> 00:30:10.867
And what makes you such an expert?

365
00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.533
Cause I know people that have done it.

366
00:30:18.992 --> 00:30:19.867
Thank you.

367
00:30:20.408 --> 00:30:23.283
Yes. Thanks for coming in, Ms. Tramell.
Sorry to inconvenience you.

368
00:30:23.783 --> 00:30:25.075
Could someone give me a ride home?

369
00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:27.367
Sure.

370
00:30:29.533 --> 00:30:30.367
Thank you.

371
00:30:35.783 --> 00:30:36.742
Wanna get a drink?

372
00:30:48.075 --> 00:30:48.950
Rough day?

373
00:30:50.075 --> 00:30:50.908
Not really.

374
00:30:51.492 --> 00:30:53.367
Beating that machine can't be easy.

375
00:30:55.242 --> 00:30:57.742
If I was guilty,
and I wanted to beat that machine,

376
00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.117
it wouldn't be hard.

377
00:31:00.908 --> 00:31:02.075
Wouldn't be hard at all.

378
00:31:05.283 --> 00:31:08.783
You took a lie detector test after you
shot those two people, didn't you?

379
00:31:12.283 --> 00:31:13.408
I passed.

380
00:31:14.908 --> 00:31:17.700
You see? We're both innocent, Nick.

381
00:31:36.158 --> 00:31:38.158
You seem to know an awful lot about me.

382
00:31:39.783 --> 00:31:41.242
You know an awful lot about me.

383
00:31:43.825 --> 00:31:45.992
I don't know anything
that's not police business.

384
00:31:49.533 --> 00:31:51.158
You know I don't wear any underwear.

385
00:31:51.992 --> 00:31:52.992
Don't you, Nick?

386
00:32:02.075 --> 00:32:03.117
Thanks for the ride.

387
00:32:18.617 --> 00:32:20.533
- Get you another glass of wine?
- Yeah.

388
00:32:22.617 --> 00:32:23.742
- Hi, Nick.
- Evening.

389
00:32:26.825 --> 00:32:28.325
So what is all this "Nick" stuff?

390
00:32:28.492 --> 00:32:30.867
Nick, do you wanna cigarette?
Nick, can I have a ride?

391
00:32:31.033 --> 00:32:33.867
She didn't ask me to give her a ride.
She asked anybody.

392
00:32:34.033 --> 00:32:36.325
- And you volunteered.
- Hey, Nick. Evian?

393
00:32:36.492 --> 00:32:39.867
Uh, no Chuck. You get me a double
Black Jack on the rocks, please.

394
00:32:41.658 --> 00:32:42.617
What you doing, hos?

395
00:32:44.992 --> 00:32:46.617
I haven't had a drink in three months.

396
00:32:47.867 --> 00:32:48.950
That all right with you, cowboy?

397
00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:53.908
- She doesn't know me, okay.
- Here you go, Nick.

398
00:32:54.158 --> 00:32:56.575
I never seen her
before, uh, Gus and I talked to her.

399
00:32:57.367 --> 00:32:58.158
Thanks, Chuck.

400
00:32:58.325 --> 00:33:00.242
- You're sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

401
00:33:01.533 --> 00:33:02.492
Cheers.

402
00:33:11.242 --> 00:33:12.075
Now what?

403
00:33:12.575 --> 00:33:16.075
What now what? Now nothing.
She passed the polygraph. That's it.

404
00:33:16.283 --> 00:33:18.200
She knew how to beat it.
That's why she asked to take it.

405
00:33:18.408 --> 00:33:21.408
Now how in the fuck do you know?
What is it with you and this broad anyway?

406
00:33:21.783 --> 00:33:23.783
Oh, come on, Phil.
Do not let this one slide.

407
00:33:24.283 --> 00:33:26.325
What about her parents?
What about what else she published?

408
00:33:26.492 --> 00:33:28.492
Maybe all her books
got a funny way of coming true.

409
00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:31.742
Her parents died in an accident. I don't
give a shit what else she published.

410
00:33:31.908 --> 00:33:33.700
What are you all of a sudden?
A book critic?

411
00:33:33.908 --> 00:33:36.700
How did they die? Huh?
Was there an investigation?

412
00:33:37.117 --> 00:33:40.325
Now you're saying she killed her parents?
Did she kill Manny Vasquez, too?

413
00:33:41.658 --> 00:33:45.658
Not unless she climbed into the ring
and turned into one mean son of a bitch.

414
00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:50.200
Maybe she did, Gus. Maybe she grew herself
an Afro, developed a hell of a left hook,

415
00:33:50.408 --> 00:33:51.783
and put shoe polish all over her face.

416
00:33:51.992 --> 00:33:54.367
- Let's polygraph her again and ask her.
- Fuck you, Phil.

417
00:33:54.783 --> 00:33:55.867
-Fuck you, too Nick.

418
00:33:56.533 --> 00:33:57.908
Don't worry, Phil.
Nick will fuck himself.

419
00:33:58.075 --> 00:33:59.950
- Yeah, right.
- You guys are very funny.

420
00:34:00.367 --> 00:34:02.033
Hey, Chucky,
get me another double, will you?

421
00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.867
- Coming right up.
- Hey, Shooter...

422
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:07.658
Are you back on the Black Jack, Shooter?

423
00:34:07.992 --> 00:34:11.450
- We're discussing a case here, Marty.
- I know that. I have no doubts.

424
00:34:11.658 --> 00:34:12.575
Here you go, Nick.

425
00:34:13.283 --> 00:34:14.325
Oh!

426
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:17.783
A double, huh, Shooter? Hmm?

427
00:34:22.283 --> 00:34:23.533
I'm off-duty, Nilsen.

428
00:34:26.283 --> 00:34:29.658
You hear me?
I'm off-duty discussing a case.

429
00:34:29.825 --> 00:34:31.700
Now, IA shouldn't have
a problem with that.

430
00:34:34.908 --> 00:34:36.867
Maybe I should put in
for some overtime, huh?

431
00:34:39.367 --> 00:34:41.117
Don't work too hard, Shooter.

432
00:34:41.742 --> 00:34:43.033
Might drive you to drink.

433
00:34:46.533 --> 00:34:47.158
Stop riding me, man.

434
00:34:47.367 --> 00:34:49.450
- I'll kick your fucking teeth in.
- Hey!

435
00:34:49.742 --> 00:34:50.700
What's the problem?

436
00:34:51.575 --> 00:34:54.408
No problem, Doctor.
Here comes the shrink...

437
00:34:55.075 --> 00:34:55.950
- Oh, come on.
- ...huh, just in time

438
00:34:56.117 --> 00:34:57.367
to save her favorite patient.

439
00:34:57.533 --> 00:34:58.950
Just fuck off, Marty.

440
00:35:00.783 --> 00:35:03.117
You kids have a good time tonight, huh?

441
00:35:09.117 --> 00:35:11.575
- He's asking for it.
- That's right. So don't take the bait.

442
00:35:16.117 --> 00:35:17.033
You wanna go?

443
00:35:19.575 --> 00:35:20.533
- Yes.
- Let's go.

444
00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.242
Sometimes I think he started banging her

445
00:35:26.408 --> 00:35:28.242
just to get off the hook
with Internal Affairs.

446
00:35:28.408 --> 00:35:31.117
He ain't that way. He's got a heart.

447
00:37:01.908 --> 00:37:03.533
Nick!

448
00:37:04.408 --> 00:37:06.325
- Stop! No!
- That's right. Come on.

449
00:37:10.867 --> 00:37:11.783
No.

450
00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:16.200
You like it this way. Keep it down.

451
00:37:27.492 --> 00:37:28.492
Oh.

452
00:37:44.867 --> 00:37:45.908
What was she like?

453
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:48.450
- Who?
- Catherine Tramell.

454
00:37:51.992 --> 00:37:54.575
You had her pegged.
She used her book as an alibi.

455
00:37:57.825 --> 00:37:58.867
I met her at Berkeley.

456
00:38:02.242 --> 00:38:04.075
We were in some of the same classes.

457
00:38:05.033 --> 00:38:06.033
Why didn't you tell me?

458
00:38:07.825 --> 00:38:08.783
I'm telling you.

459
00:38:19.575 --> 00:38:21.158
You've never been like that before.

460
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.200
- Why?
- You tell me. You're the shrink.

461
00:38:28.283 --> 00:38:30.700
- You weren't making love to me.
- Who was I making love to?

462
00:38:31.117 --> 00:38:32.200
You weren't making love.

463
00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:39.492
I need a cigarette.

464
00:38:40.908 --> 00:38:41.950
I thought you said you quit.

465
00:38:47.867 --> 00:38:49.533
It's the top drawer in the foyer.

466
00:38:51.158 --> 00:38:52.325
Get it on your way out.

467
00:38:55.992 --> 00:38:56.825
Okay.

468
00:39:03.825 --> 00:39:05.242
Scotty.

469
00:39:06.575 --> 00:39:07.742
You look like dogshit.

470
00:39:07.908 --> 00:39:11.242
- Nah, he looks a little shrunk, is all.
- Not just in the head.

471
00:39:12.617 --> 00:39:16.575
All right. I made a couple of calls to
Berkeley. There was a murder in '80.

472
00:39:16.742 --> 00:39:21.575
A professor. In his bed.
Multiple stab wounds. With an icepick.

473
00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:25.117
Tramell was there then, wasn't she?

474
00:39:27.408 --> 00:39:29.325
University records say she was.

475
00:39:31.117 --> 00:39:33.408
Okay, let's move on this.
Gus, get out to Berkeley.

476
00:39:33.575 --> 00:39:35.492
Harrigan, find out
what else she's published.

477
00:39:35.658 --> 00:39:37.450
Andrews, you get me
that file on her parents' accident.

478
00:39:37.617 --> 00:39:40.367
Copy Beth on everything.
I want psychological input on this.

479
00:39:40.533 --> 00:39:41.283
What about me?

480
00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:43.617
You're already
getting psychological input, hos.

481
00:39:43.783 --> 00:39:45.783
You go soak your head
in a tub of ice water.

482
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:49.908
Nick...

483
00:39:55.783 --> 00:39:57.200
You see where she leads.

484
00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:00.617
Thank you.

485
00:41:34.158 --> 00:41:35.367
No!

486
00:42:13.408 --> 00:42:14.533
Uh-huh.

487
00:45:52.733 --> 00:45:54.692
Ain't you got nothing better to do
than come in here

488
00:45:54.858 --> 00:45:57.942
- and jack off the damn machine?
- What are you doing here, cowboy?

489
00:45:58.275 --> 00:46:00.900
I came in here
to jack off the damn machine.

490
00:46:01.817 --> 00:46:06.942
One dead psychology professor.
Noah Goldstein. Dr. Noah Goldstein.

491
00:46:07.567 --> 00:46:08.358
And guess what?

492
00:46:09.525 --> 00:46:10.650
He was her counselor.

493
00:46:11.442 --> 00:46:12.442
Was she a suspect?

494
00:46:12.817 --> 00:46:15.067
No, sir. They never even got
a statement from her.

495
00:46:16.983 --> 00:46:18.525
Hazel Dobkins?

496
00:46:19.567 --> 00:46:20.442
You know her?

497
00:46:21.233 --> 00:46:23.275
Couldn't get it
out of my head for years.

498
00:46:23.942 --> 00:46:26.567
Nice little housewife, three little kids,

499
00:46:26.775 --> 00:46:30.275
nice husband, wasn't porkin' around,
no financial problems.

500
00:46:31.025 --> 00:46:35.108
One day outta the clear blue sky,
she does 'em. All of 'em.

501
00:46:35.317 --> 00:46:36.317
Used a knife

502
00:46:36.483 --> 00:46:37.942
she got for a wedding present.

503
00:46:38.983 --> 00:46:41.275
Didn't even deny it. Sweet as honey.

504
00:46:42.192 --> 00:46:43.983
Said she didn't know why she done it.

505
00:46:58.067 --> 00:47:00.275
- Hi.
- Am I disturbing you?

506
00:47:01.275 --> 00:47:02.275
No. Come on in

507
00:47:04.358 --> 00:47:05.317
Let's go upstairs.

508
00:47:23.525 --> 00:47:25.525
I'm using you
for my detective in my book.

509
00:47:26.525 --> 00:47:27.567
You don't mind, do you?

510
00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:35.400
I was just gonna make
myself a drink. Do you want one?

511
00:47:35.775 --> 00:47:36.650
No, thanks.

512
00:47:36.942 --> 00:47:39.942
Oh, that's right. You're off
the Jack Daniels too, aren't you?

513
00:47:44.317 --> 00:47:46.400
Got a, uh, few more questions to ask you.

514
00:47:46.567 --> 00:47:47.775
I have some for you too.

515
00:47:48.442 --> 00:47:49.358
For my book.

516
00:47:59.692 --> 00:48:01.817
You have something against ice cubes?

517
00:48:03.108 --> 00:48:04.192
I like rough edges.

518
00:48:05.233 --> 00:48:06.358
So what do you wanna ask me?

519
00:48:08.525 --> 00:48:09.775
How does it feel to kill someone?

520
00:48:13.317 --> 00:48:14.275
You tell me.

521
00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.650
I don't know. But you do.

522
00:48:20.608 --> 00:48:22.275
It was an accident. They...

523
00:48:22.483 --> 00:48:23.650
They got in the line of fire.

524
00:48:27.775 --> 00:48:30.942
Four shootings in five years.
All accidents?

525
00:48:33.317 --> 00:48:35.733
They were drug buys.
I was working undercover.

526
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:40.025
You wanna tell me about
Professor Goldstein.

527
00:48:44.442 --> 00:48:46.150
Well, there's a name from the past.

528
00:48:46.317 --> 00:48:49.067
You want a name from the present?
What about Hazel Dobkins?

529
00:48:51.567 --> 00:48:54.108
Noah Goldstein was my counselor
in my freshman year.

530
00:48:55.525 --> 00:48:58.233
That's probably where I got the idea
for the icepick. For my book.

531
00:49:00.733 --> 00:49:02.733
Funny how the subconscious works.

532
00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:04.567
Hilarious.

533
00:49:06.858 --> 00:49:07.900
Hazel is my friend.

534
00:49:08.067 --> 00:49:10.567
Well, your friend
took out her whole family.

535
00:49:10.983 --> 00:49:13.775
Yes. She's helped me understand
homicidal impulse.

536
00:49:13.942 --> 00:49:15.983
Thought you would learn that at school.

537
00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:21.858
Only in theory. But you know
all about homicidal impulse...

538
00:49:22.942 --> 00:49:23.942
don't you, Shooter?

539
00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.108
Not in theory, in practice.

540
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:32.858
What happened? Did you get sucked into it?

541
00:49:34.067 --> 00:49:35.483
Did you like it too much?

542
00:49:38.525 --> 00:49:40.108
I don't know what you're talking about.

543
00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:44.775
Tell me about the coke, Nick.

544
00:49:47.733 --> 00:49:49.650
The day you shot those two tourists...

545
00:49:50.858 --> 00:49:52.275
how much coke did you do?

546
00:49:56.275 --> 00:49:59.233
Come on. You can tell me.

547
00:50:05.775 --> 00:50:08.442
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

548
00:50:09.608 --> 00:50:11.483
They never tested you, did they?

549
00:50:13.567 --> 00:50:14.900
Internal Affairs knew.

550
00:50:18.025 --> 00:50:20.275
Your wife knew too, didn't she?

551
00:50:26.358 --> 00:50:28.108
She knew what was going on.

552
00:50:31.692 --> 00:50:33.525
Nicky got too close to the flame.

553
00:50:41.483 --> 00:50:42.692
Nicky liked it.

554
00:50:48.108 --> 00:50:49.858
That's why she killed herself.

555
00:51:06.108 --> 00:51:07.025
Hiya, hon.

556
00:51:12.192 --> 00:51:13.608
You two have met, haven't you?

557
00:51:23.108 --> 00:51:26.858
You're gonna make
a terrific character, Nick.

558
00:51:36.992 --> 00:51:38.867
She's on the phone.
She'll be right with you, detective--

559
00:51:39.825 --> 00:51:42.033
Oh. I'm gonna
have to give you a call back.

560
00:51:42.325 --> 00:51:44.700
- Detective. Detective, you can't go in--
- Let me call you back.

561
00:51:45.825 --> 00:51:46.992
Who's got access to my file?

562
00:51:47.158 --> 00:51:50.117
- What are you talking about, Nick?
- Who has access to my goddamn file?

563
00:51:50.325 --> 00:51:53.742
Nobody. It's a confidential
psychiatric record, it would be illegal.

564
00:51:53.908 --> 00:51:56.617
Don't do it. Don't you fucking lie to me.

565
00:51:57.325 --> 00:51:58.700
- It's Internal Affairs. Was it?
- No.

566
00:51:59.117 --> 00:52:00.492
- No, Nick. Please.
- Who.

567
00:52:01.283 --> 00:52:02.533
It's, uh.. Nilsen.

568
00:52:14.783 --> 00:52:15.825
What do you want, Curran?

569
00:52:15.992 --> 00:52:17.825
You sold her my file, didn't you?

570
00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:20.033
What are you talking about?

571
00:52:20.658 --> 00:52:22.033
Catherine Tramell.

572
00:52:22.408 --> 00:52:23.533
How much did she pay you?

573
00:52:23.992 --> 00:52:25.242
Hey. Come on!

574
00:52:25.408 --> 00:52:26.450
- Let him go!
- Stop it!

575
00:52:27.742 --> 00:52:28.533
How much?

576
00:52:28.742 --> 00:52:29.533
Come on.

577
00:52:30.825 --> 00:52:33.783
Hey, back off. Just back off, Curran.

578
00:52:34.617 --> 00:52:36.617
Nice and easy now. Nice and easy.

579
00:52:37.867 --> 00:52:39.658
You fucked yourself, Shooter. You hear me?

580
00:52:39.825 --> 00:52:40.617
- You are out!
- Take it easy.

581
00:52:41.033 --> 00:52:43.408
- Cool it. Take it easy.
- You are out! You're out.

582
00:52:43.617 --> 00:52:45.867
- Okay, okay.
- Save it. Save it.

583
00:52:48.533 --> 00:52:49.450
Nick!

584
00:52:50.033 --> 00:52:52.325
- What's going down, hos?
- Nothing, all right. I'll be okay.

585
00:52:52.492 --> 00:52:54.033
No, sir. You won't.
They're gonna want your badge.

586
00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:55.533
I'm tired of being played with.

587
00:52:55.742 --> 00:52:58.158
You got a real conclusive way
of demonstrating that.

588
00:53:04.450 --> 00:53:07.325
She knows where I live and breathe.

589
00:53:09.617 --> 00:53:11.283
She's coming after me, Gus.

590
00:53:12.783 --> 00:53:14.200
What is it you got between you?

591
00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:18.575
I don't know.

592
00:53:19.117 --> 00:53:20.117
It's something though.

593
00:53:21.992 --> 00:53:22.992
Something.

594
00:53:24.075 --> 00:53:24.867
Yeah.

595
00:53:34.283 --> 00:53:38.117
George Jefferson is unfair.
He's short with no hair.

596
00:53:41.575 --> 00:53:42.533
Nick?

597
00:53:44.492 --> 00:53:45.533
Nick, are you there?

598
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:48.325
Go away, Beth. I don't wanna see you.

599
00:53:55.742 --> 00:53:56.950
I still have my key.

600
00:53:59.908 --> 00:54:01.533
Put 'em on the table and leave.

601
00:54:05.408 --> 00:54:07.033
Put 'em on the goddamn table
and leave?

602
00:54:07.242 --> 00:54:10.117
Damnit. Don't shut me out.
You owe me more than that.

603
00:54:12.742 --> 00:54:14.450
I don't owe you anything.

604
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:17.700
You don't owe me anything.

605
00:54:18.825 --> 00:54:21.283
We went to bed, what, ten, 15 times?

606
00:54:21.492 --> 00:54:24.242
Maybe it wasn't memorable enough
to, to carry an obligation.

607
00:54:27.033 --> 00:54:30.867
- Sometimes I really hate you.
- Oh! Why don't you get yourself

608
00:54:31.033 --> 00:54:34.617
some friendly little therapist
and work out some of that hostility?

609
00:54:35.075 --> 00:54:36.658
And maybe you can get off once in a while.

610
00:54:41.575 --> 00:54:42.575
Are you nuts?

611
00:54:53.617 --> 00:54:54.950
I'm sorry...

612
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:58.158
I don't usually act like that.

613
00:54:59.908 --> 00:55:01.450
How could you give him my file?

614
00:55:02.283 --> 00:55:03.283
I had to.

615
00:55:04.742 --> 00:55:07.033
He was going to recommend
your discharge from the force.

616
00:55:08.075 --> 00:55:10.700
He didn't buy my evaluation.
He said I wasn't objective.

617
00:55:11.158 --> 00:55:13.950
So I made a deal with him to review
the session notes himself.

618
00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:16.658
I didn't think he'd show them to anybody.

619
00:55:17.742 --> 00:55:18.700
You did it for me?

620
00:55:19.492 --> 00:55:22.200
Yes. I care about you.
I did it for you.

621
00:55:28.158 --> 00:55:31.408
Go away, Beth. Please, just go away.

622
00:56:00.033 --> 00:56:00.950
Yo.

623
00:56:06.242 --> 00:56:07.200
I'm on my way.

624
00:56:59.575 --> 00:57:03.492
One shot. Close range.
Probably a .38 caliber revolver.

625
00:57:05.283 --> 00:57:06.242
Give me your gun, Nick.

626
00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:17.658
You think that--

627
00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:26.575
I don't, hos,
but I got the minority opinion.

628
00:57:31.533 --> 00:57:32.492
Okay. I went after him.

629
00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:35.325
I lost my temper.

630
00:57:36.075 --> 00:57:38.950
You have any evidence that he showed
your psychiatric file to anyone?

631
00:57:40.783 --> 00:57:41.742
No.

632
00:57:46.033 --> 00:57:47.533
We'll speak with you afterwards,
Dr. Garner.

633
00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:49.117
I'd like to sit in. If you don't mind.

634
00:57:49.283 --> 00:57:50.658
- I'd really rather wait until after--
- I don't see anything wrong

635
00:57:50.825 --> 00:57:54.158
with Dr. Garner sitting in
if Detective Curran doesn't object.

636
00:57:59.867 --> 00:58:00.992
Where were you last night?

637
00:58:01.492 --> 00:58:02.575
Home. Watching TV.

638
00:58:03.033 --> 00:58:03.992
All night?

639
00:58:05.575 --> 00:58:06.533
Yes. All night.

640
00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:08.575
Were you drinking?

641
00:58:13.325 --> 00:58:14.325
Yeah, I was drinking.

642
00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:15.950
When did you start drinking again?

643
00:58:16.367 --> 00:58:17.367
Couple of days ago.

644
00:58:17.617 --> 00:58:21.117
I saw Detective Curran at his apartment
about ten o'clock last night.

645
00:58:21.283 --> 00:58:22.533
He was sober and lucid.

646
00:58:23.117 --> 00:58:25.700
I asked him in my capacity
as his departmental therapist

647
00:58:25.867 --> 00:58:27.908
about his altercation with Lt. Nilsen.

648
00:58:28.492 --> 00:58:30.783
He expressed regret
and displayed no hostility.

649
00:58:32.575 --> 00:58:33.825
How long were you at his apartment?

650
00:58:33.992 --> 00:58:35.158
About 15 minutes.

651
00:58:35.783 --> 00:58:38.075
I saw there was no reason
for my concern and left.

652
00:58:39.533 --> 00:58:41.367
There's no smoking in this building,
detective.

653
00:58:43.658 --> 00:58:45.367
What are you gonna do?
Charge me with smoking?

654
00:58:47.367 --> 00:58:48.325
Oh, for Christ--

655
00:58:48.533 --> 00:58:51.950
All right, Nick, I'm gonna ask you
this just once: for the record,

656
00:58:52.242 --> 00:58:53.700
did you kill Marty Nilsen?

657
00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:57.200
No.

658
00:58:58.992 --> 00:59:01.200
Come on. I'm gonna storm
into his office in front of everybody

659
00:59:01.367 --> 00:59:02.867
in the middle of the day
and kill him that night?

660
00:59:03.825 --> 00:59:04.950
I'm not that dumb.

661
00:59:05.367 --> 00:59:07.533
Going after him before
gets you off the hook for killing him.

662
00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:08.658
That's your alibi.

663
00:59:09.408 --> 00:59:12.492
Like writing a book about killing a guy
gets you off the hook for killing him.

664
00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:13.575
Good point.

665
00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:15.533
I don't understand.
What are you talking about? What book?

666
00:59:15.908 --> 00:59:17.200
Private joke, asshole.

667
00:59:17.367 --> 00:59:18.492
I don't think it's funny.

668
00:59:19.533 --> 00:59:21.117
You're going on leave, Curran...

669
00:59:21.825 --> 00:59:24.283
pending the outcome
of a psychiatric evaluation.

670
00:59:36.283 --> 00:59:38.367
Beth! I'll get my stuff in a minute.

671
00:59:41.575 --> 00:59:42.450
Beth!

672
00:59:44.492 --> 00:59:45.283
Thank you.

673
00:59:49.867 --> 00:59:51.075
It's the least I could do.

674
00:59:52.033 --> 00:59:54.742
Considering, I got you into this mess
with those reports.

675
00:59:54.908 --> 00:59:56.617
No. I mean it, thank you.

676
00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:02.075
How do you know Catherine Tramell
saw your file?

677
01:00:02.533 --> 01:00:04.867
She know things about me
that I only told you.

678
01:00:06.450 --> 01:00:07.783
She must really be something...

679
01:00:08.992 --> 01:00:10.367
from a clinical point of view.

680
01:00:11.575 --> 01:00:12.783
What was she like in school?

681
01:00:13.033 --> 01:00:15.700
I hardly knew her.
She gave me the creeps, though.

682
01:00:16.408 --> 01:00:17.367
I don't know why.

683
01:00:22.158 --> 01:00:24.742
Get some rest. Promise?

684
01:00:30.908 --> 01:00:32.242
Beth. I didn't mean what I said
yesterday--

685
01:00:32.408 --> 01:00:33.450
Yes you did.

686
01:00:34.992 --> 01:00:36.783
I'm a big girl. I can handle it.

687
01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:03.825
- Hey, you take care of yourself.
- What did you find out about the parents?

688
01:01:04.908 --> 01:01:05.950
You're on leave, man.

689
01:01:07.783 --> 01:01:10.658
You're on psycho leave. I mean,
I'm talking to a possible whacko here.

690
01:01:11.117 --> 01:01:13.492
Well, you know I'm whacko, Sam.
What did you find out?

691
01:01:17.617 --> 01:01:18.575
The boat blew.

692
01:01:19.783 --> 01:01:23.033
There was a leak in the fuel line.
There have been two previous repairs.

693
01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.867
They had a five mil policy on both of 'em.

694
01:01:25.075 --> 01:01:27.117
A real heavy investigation,
but they got zilch.

695
01:01:27.575 --> 01:01:30.117
Big goose-egg. It was an accident.

696
01:01:30.283 --> 01:01:31.992
IA's gonna talk to you
more about Nilsen.

697
01:01:32.158 --> 01:01:33.825
They're handling the investigation,
we're not.

698
01:01:33.992 --> 01:01:36.367
You stay in touch with Dr. Garner,
it'll help on the evaluation.

699
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:38.033
She killed him, Phil.

700
01:01:40.242 --> 01:01:42.492
- Beth? Now you've got Beth killing people?
- No, Catherine Tramell.

701
01:01:42.658 --> 01:01:43.575
It's part of her game.

702
01:01:44.617 --> 01:01:47.242
First you've got her stealing your file.
Now you've got her killing Nilsen.

703
01:01:48.033 --> 01:01:50.658
Forget about her for Christ sake?
Go somewhere. Sit in the sun.

704
01:01:50.867 --> 01:01:53.450
- Ger her the hell out of your system.
- You don't buy it, do you?

705
01:01:54.575 --> 01:01:56.075
She knew nobody would buy it.

706
01:01:56.825 --> 01:01:59.658
She knew I'd say she did it.
And she knew that nobody would buy it.

707
01:02:00.158 --> 01:02:02.408
She is screwing with your head, Nick.

708
01:02:02.617 --> 01:02:03.408
Stay away from her.

709
01:02:31.158 --> 01:02:32.408
I heard about what happened.

710
01:02:41.358 --> 01:02:42.942
What good's a shooter without his gun?

711
01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.900
How exactly did you find out?

712
01:02:46.358 --> 01:02:49.858
I have attorneys. They have friends.
I have friends.

713
01:02:50.775 --> 01:02:52.692
Money buys a lot of attorneys and friends.

714
01:02:53.275 --> 01:02:55.275
Well, I wouldn't know about that.
I don't have any money.

715
01:02:55.608 --> 01:02:58.733
I don't have any attorneys,
and Gus is my only real friend.

716
01:02:59.358 --> 01:03:00.983
I wasn't talking about real friends.

717
01:03:06.067 --> 01:03:07.400
Why doesn't Gus like me?

718
01:03:09.233 --> 01:03:10.192
I like you.

719
01:03:11.817 --> 01:03:13.275
- You do?
- Yes.

720
01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:16.942
You wanna go upstairs and have a drink?

721
01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:21.108
I didn't think you'd ask me.

722
01:03:22.817 --> 01:03:24.775
Then I guess you don't know
your character that well.

723
01:03:25.358 --> 01:03:28.317
Maybe, but we're learning.

724
01:03:29.233 --> 01:03:31.275
Pretty soon I'll know you better
than you know yourself.

725
01:03:31.983 --> 01:03:33.983
- Don't be too sure.
- Why not?

726
01:03:34.733 --> 01:03:36.400
- I'm very unpredictable.
- Unpredictable?

727
01:03:46.858 --> 01:03:48.650
You ought to put some warmth
into the place.

728
01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.442
You don't want it to reflect
on your personality.

729
01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:53.150
I'm not trying to fool anybody.

730
01:03:54.233 --> 01:03:56.108
Jack Daniel's all right?
It's gonna have to be.

731
01:03:56.567 --> 01:03:57.650
- Ice?
- Yeah, great.

732
01:04:07.233 --> 01:04:08.025
I was expecting you.

733
01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:15.358
K-mart. A buck sixty-five.

734
01:04:21.025 --> 01:04:22.400
Why don't you let me do this for you?

735
01:04:31.108 --> 01:04:32.692
You like watching me do it, don't you?

736
01:04:36.608 --> 01:04:41.067
Could I have a cigarette too, please?
See, I told you you'd start smoking again.

737
01:04:41.567 --> 01:04:42.525
Would you light it for me?

738
01:04:49.483 --> 01:04:50.317
Thanks.

739
01:04:53.317 --> 01:04:55.233
So how much
did you pay Nilsen for my file?

740
01:04:57.900 --> 01:04:59.900
Isn't he the policeman
that you shot, Shooter?

741
01:05:02.650 --> 01:05:04.400
What if I asked you
not to call me Shooter?

742
01:05:04.775 --> 01:05:07.400
Okay. How about if I call you Nicky?

743
01:05:09.733 --> 01:05:11.192
My wife used to call me Nicky.

744
01:05:12.733 --> 01:05:15.317
Yeah, I know. I like it.

745
01:05:20.692 --> 01:05:23.233
Cheers. My friends call me Catherine.

746
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:25.733
What Manny Vasquez used to call you?

747
01:05:26.483 --> 01:05:27.483
Bitch, mostly,

748
01:05:28.567 --> 01:05:30.025
but he meant it affectionately.

749
01:05:32.108 --> 01:05:33.067
Do you have any coke?

750
01:05:35.692 --> 01:05:36.983
I just love coke with Jack Daniels.

751
01:05:37.983 --> 01:05:39.067
Got a Pepsi in the fridge.

752
01:05:40.275 --> 01:05:42.275
Well, it's not really the same thing,
now is it?

753
01:05:44.025 --> 01:05:44.942
No, it's not.

754
01:05:48.192 --> 01:05:49.275
So where is this going?

755
01:05:50.233 --> 01:05:51.150
Hmm?

756
01:05:53.275 --> 01:05:54.233
What do you want from me?

757
01:05:58.275 --> 01:06:00.525
Say,
"What do you want from me, Catherine?"

758
01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:05.650
What the fuck
do you want from me, Catherine?

759
01:06:13.733 --> 01:06:14.858
I brought you something.

760
01:06:21.983 --> 01:06:23.817
Aren't you gonna say thank you?

761
01:06:25.233 --> 01:06:26.192
What's it about?

762
01:06:26.608 --> 01:06:28.358
It's about a boy who kills his parents.

763
01:06:28.525 --> 01:06:30.608
They have a plane.
He makes it look like an accident.

764
01:06:34.942 --> 01:06:35.733
Why'd he do that?

765
01:06:37.692 --> 01:06:39.358
To see if he could get away with it.

766
01:06:43.317 --> 01:06:44.358
When'd you write this?

767
01:06:45.817 --> 01:06:47.567
You mean, did I write it
before my parents died?

768
01:06:47.733 --> 01:06:48.692
Yeah.

769
01:06:53.483 --> 01:06:54.275
No.

770
01:06:55.233 --> 01:06:56.400
I wrote it years afterwards.

771
01:06:58.317 --> 01:07:00.067
You're not gonna stop
following me around now, are you?

772
01:07:00.233 --> 01:07:01.317
Just because you're on leave.

773
01:07:02.108 --> 01:07:03.275
Absolutely not.

774
01:07:05.317 --> 01:07:06.442
Good. I'd miss you.

775
01:07:07.233 --> 01:07:09.400
You could get in trouble, though.
You're not really a cop anymore.

776
01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:10.525
I'll risk it.

777
01:07:11.567 --> 01:07:13.858
-Why take the risk?
-To see if I can get away with it.

778
01:07:18.442 --> 01:07:19.483
How's your new book?

779
01:07:19.650 --> 01:07:21.317
It's practically
writing itself.

780
01:07:22.525 --> 01:07:25.775
Oh, I'll be leaving about midnight.
In case you are gonna follow me.

781
01:07:28.108 --> 01:07:29.733
I'll be at Johnny Boz's club.

782
01:07:29.983 --> 01:07:31.025
I'll meet you there.

783
01:07:33.733 --> 01:07:34.608
Hi, Gus.

784
01:07:51.775 --> 01:07:54.817
Forgive me for asking, hos,
and I don't mean to belabor the obvious,

785
01:07:55.317 --> 01:07:58.483
but why is it you've got your head
so far up your own ass?

786
01:07:59.150 --> 01:08:02.192
She wanna play. Fine, I can play.

787
01:08:04.067 --> 01:08:05.775
Everybody she plays with dies.

788
01:08:07.358 --> 01:08:08.400
I know what that's like.

789
01:09:04.567 --> 01:09:05.983
- Hi.
- Hi, babe.

790
01:09:08.108 --> 01:09:09.108
Looks good.

791
01:14:32.317 --> 01:14:36.983
Hey. Shh.

792
01:14:37.525 --> 01:14:38.650
Shh.

793
01:16:39.175 --> 01:16:41.050
If you don't leave her alone,
I'll kill you.

794
01:16:48.217 --> 01:16:50.008
Let me ask you something, Rocky.

795
01:16:52.217 --> 01:16:53.133
Man to man.

796
01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:58.050
I think she's the fuck of the century.

797
01:17:03.008 --> 01:17:03.967
What do you think?

798
01:17:09.008 --> 01:17:10.050
How long you been here?

799
01:17:12.258 --> 01:17:13.467
You like watching,

800
01:17:13.675 --> 01:17:14.550
don't you?

801
01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.300
She likes me to watch.

802
01:17:45.342 --> 01:17:46.592
Nicky...

803
01:18:05.217 --> 01:18:06.092
Fuck.

804
01:18:11.925 --> 01:18:13.342
<i>The beach</i>
<i>C</i>

805
01:18:36.425 --> 01:18:37.383
Hi.

806
01:18:57.175 --> 01:18:58.092
Good morning.

807
01:19:00.258 --> 01:19:02.967
Guess, uh, Roxy's not taking this
too well, huh?

808
01:19:03.425 --> 01:19:05.342
She's seen me fuck plenty of guys.

809
01:19:06.758 --> 01:19:09.342
Maybe she saw something
she's never seen before.

810
01:19:11.633 --> 01:19:13.092
She's seen everything before.

811
01:19:13.342 --> 01:19:15.717
Honey, I thought
I'd seen everything before.

812
01:19:16.633 --> 01:19:18.800
Did you really think it was so special?

813
01:19:19.925 --> 01:19:22.133
I told her I thought
it was the fuck of the century.

814
01:19:28.258 --> 01:19:29.258
Well, what do you think?

815
01:19:30.508 --> 01:19:32.050
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.

816
01:19:37.842 --> 01:19:39.008
What about Roxy?

817
01:19:39.550 --> 01:19:40.592
Is she more fun?

818
01:19:40.758 --> 01:19:43.425
Do you like her
to join us sometime?

819
01:19:44.592 --> 01:19:46.217
Did she join you and Johnny?

820
01:19:46.675 --> 01:19:48.633
No, Johnny felt intimidated.

821
01:19:49.383 --> 01:19:50.467
Look what happened to him.

822
01:19:51.925 --> 01:19:54.050
Tell me, Nicky,
were you frightened last night?

823
01:19:54.508 --> 01:19:57.383
That's the point, wasn't it?
That's what made it so good.

824
01:19:59.550 --> 01:20:02.550
- You shouldn't play this game.
- Why not? I like it.

825
01:20:03.758 --> 01:20:04.717
You're in over your head.

826
01:20:05.133 --> 01:20:08.258
Maybe.
But this is how I'll catch my killer.

827
01:20:13.050 --> 01:20:16.842
I'm not gonna confess all my secrets,
Nick, just because I have an orgasm.

828
01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.883
You won't learn anything
I don't want you to know.

829
01:20:21.258 --> 01:20:22.425
Yes, I will.

830
01:20:23.550 --> 01:20:24.508
And I'll nail you.

831
01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:27.383
You'll just fall in love with me.

832
01:20:29.133 --> 01:20:30.550
I'm in love with you already.

833
01:20:34.925 --> 01:20:36.050
But I'll nail you anyway.

834
01:20:38.425 --> 01:20:39.800
You can put that in your book.

835
01:21:03.167 --> 01:21:04.292
Thought I'd find you here.

836
01:21:05.125 --> 01:21:08.000
Where the fuck you been?
I've been over to your place.

837
01:21:08.167 --> 01:21:12.083
Easy, cowboy, easy. I wasn't there.

838
01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:14.625
I went over last night, too.

839
01:21:16.083 --> 01:21:17.458
Well, I wasn't there either.

840
01:21:24.167 --> 01:21:25.250
You fucked her.

841
01:21:26.875 --> 01:21:31.083
Goddamn dumb son of a bitch.
You fucked her.

842
01:21:32.083 --> 01:21:36.250
Goddamn, you are one dumb
son of a bitch.

843
01:21:36.417 --> 01:21:37.708
Next time I'll use a rubber.

844
01:21:37.875 --> 01:21:41.083
I don't give a flying chili-bean fart
about a rubber.

845
01:21:41.250 --> 01:21:42.375
Gus, Gus, Gus,
you're forgetting something.

846
01:21:42.542 --> 01:21:44.167
- I got it, Harry. How much?
- Thirty-three.

847
01:21:44.333 --> 01:21:45.333
Got it.

848
01:21:46.083 --> 01:21:48.125
I'm worried about him.
He's worried about rubbers.

849
01:21:48.292 --> 01:21:50.042
You gotta protect yourself, Gus.
You really do.

850
01:21:50.208 --> 01:21:51.542
What in the hell for?

851
01:21:52.792 --> 01:21:54.083
You think I'm getting any?

852
01:21:54.417 --> 01:21:58.000
I mean, sure, I can get laid
by goddamn blue-haired women.

853
01:21:58.292 --> 01:21:59.250
I don't like 'em.

854
01:21:59.750 --> 01:22:01.542
Don't knock it
till you've tried it.

855
01:22:08.042 --> 01:22:09.083
Feeling better?

856
01:22:09.292 --> 01:22:10.417
I feel fine.

857
01:22:12.208 --> 01:22:13.375
How could you fuck her?

858
01:22:15.083 --> 01:22:15.958
Gus, come on.

859
01:22:20.375 --> 01:22:21.667
You wanna die, hos?

860
01:22:22.708 --> 01:22:24.458
What is it? Those goddamn tourists?

861
01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.667
You still feel so bad about that
you're wigglin' your way into an icepick?

862
01:22:31.208 --> 01:22:33.667
Got too many goddamn tourists
coming here anyway.

863
01:22:34.042 --> 01:22:37.417
Plenty more goddamn tourists
where they goddamn came from.

864
01:22:47.542 --> 01:22:48.792
I'm not afraid of her.

865
01:22:49.167 --> 01:22:50.333
Why the hell not?

866
01:22:53.250 --> 01:22:56.167
I don't know. I'm just not.

867
01:22:56.583 --> 01:22:57.583
That's her pussy talking,

868
01:22:57.792 --> 01:22:58.875
it ain't your brain.

869
01:22:59.083 --> 01:23:01.417
Gus, come on. Gus...

870
01:23:03.583 --> 01:23:04.500
Disgusting.

871
01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:14.000
IA done did a track
on Lt. Martin D for Dickhead Nilsen.

872
01:23:14.708 --> 01:23:16.333
They found a safety deposit box

873
01:23:16.542 --> 01:23:19.250
with 50,000 dollars in it,
taken out three months ago,

874
01:23:19.417 --> 01:23:20.542
and not used since.

875
01:23:22.792 --> 01:23:25.125
It doesn't make sense.
She didn't know me three months ago.

876
01:23:26.208 --> 01:23:27.708
Maybe it wasn't her that paid him.

877
01:23:27.917 --> 01:23:30.500
Maybe the money was for something else.
How the fuck do I know?

878
01:23:34.375 --> 01:23:37.500
I'm just an old city cowboy
trying not to fall outta his saddle.

879
01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:54.042
- You all right, cowboy?
- Yeah.

880
01:23:54.292 --> 01:23:55.125
Yeah?

881
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:56.917
Come on, I'll drive you home.

882
01:23:57.667 --> 01:24:00.625
In that little pissant car of yours?
Hell, no.

883
01:24:01.125 --> 01:24:03.792
I ain't getting
no back pain disability retirement.

884
01:24:04.167 --> 01:24:09.042
I am gonna get me a full pension
and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.

885
01:24:09.208 --> 01:24:11.500
- Right. Move over. I'm driving you--
- You think I'd let you drive

886
01:24:11.667 --> 01:24:12.917
my Cadillac car?

887
01:24:13.167 --> 01:24:17.542
I ain't gonna let no head-up-his-ass
person drive my Cadillac car.

888
01:24:18.583 --> 01:24:19.917
Grow up!

889
01:26:19.333 --> 01:26:21.042
You wanna play, huh? Come on!

890
01:26:23.875 --> 01:26:25.042
Come on!

891
01:26:32.833 --> 01:26:33.375
Come on.

892
01:27:09.458 --> 01:27:10.375
Roxy...

893
01:27:24.542 --> 01:27:26.500
- All right. Ready?
- Okay.

894
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:33.917
Lieutenant!
I got the information.

895
01:27:34.083 --> 01:27:35.542
Well, get it down here.

896
01:27:36.042 --> 01:27:38.542
This is your statement? You signed
your name to this crock of shit?

897
01:27:38.708 --> 01:27:40.000
Why not? It was an accident.

898
01:27:40.167 --> 01:27:42.458
You're driving around North Beach,
for no particular reason,

899
01:27:42.625 --> 01:27:44.042
and this car won't get out of the way.

900
01:27:44.208 --> 01:27:45.750
I don't think she meant
to go off the edge, do you?

901
01:27:45.917 --> 01:27:47.875
- Could we have him for a minute here?
- No, you cannot.

902
01:27:48.792 --> 01:27:49.875
Don't fuck with me on this, Nick.

903
01:27:50.042 --> 01:27:52.000
I don't need a reason
to put your ass in a sling.

904
01:27:52.833 --> 01:27:54.250
Full name is Roxanne Hardy.

905
01:27:54.417 --> 01:27:56.125
Last known address,
Cloverdale, California.

906
01:27:56.292 --> 01:28:00.083
No priors, no convictions. The car
is registered to Catherine Tramell.

907
01:28:01.625 --> 01:28:03.625
- You knew her, didn't you?
- Gus and I met her at Tramell's house.

908
01:28:03.792 --> 01:28:05.000
All we did was write her name down.

909
01:28:05.167 --> 01:28:09.250
You wrote her name down, and then,
big surprise, she rolls her car

910
01:28:09.417 --> 01:28:12.208
down the hill in front of you and dies.
Is that what you're telling me?

911
01:28:12.375 --> 01:28:13.542
That's all I know.

912
01:28:14.958 --> 01:28:17.292
Well, you know what then? Fuck you, Nick.

913
01:28:18.625 --> 01:28:19.708
Fuck you!

914
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.208
I want you in Dr. Garner's office
at nine--

915
01:28:21.375 --> 01:28:23.125
I told you to stay away from Tramell.

916
01:28:23.292 --> 01:28:24.667
You didn't tell me
to stay away from the car!

917
01:28:24.833 --> 01:28:26.375
I said I want you at Dr. Garner's office
at nine o'clock.

918
01:28:26.542 --> 01:28:28.458
Who are you guys gonna sell
my file to now, huh?

919
01:28:30.958 --> 01:28:33.625
You are out of control, Curran.
You hear me?

920
01:28:41.250 --> 01:28:42.208
You see--

921
01:28:43.917 --> 01:28:47.875
Hello, Nick. This is Dr. Myron
and Dr. McElwaine.

922
01:28:48.292 --> 01:28:49.292
Nick.

923
01:28:50.208 --> 01:28:53.583
They've been asked to consult with me
on this psychiatric evaluation.

924
01:28:55.167 --> 01:28:56.042
Sit down, Nick.

925
01:29:04.208 --> 01:29:05.958
Nick, we understand
you've been having some difficulty

926
01:29:06.125 --> 01:29:07.458
controlling your temper lately.

927
01:29:08.167 --> 01:29:09.875
Only in regard to one person.

928
01:29:11.417 --> 01:29:14.500
Do you think Lieutenant Nilsen
deserved to die?

929
01:29:16.458 --> 01:29:19.208
I didn't know him well enough.
I won't miss him.

930
01:29:22.375 --> 01:29:27.542
Nick, when you recollect your childhood,
are your recollections pleasing to you?

931
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.125
Number one. I don't remember
how often I used to jerk off,

932
01:29:34.333 --> 01:29:35.125
but it was a lot.

933
01:29:35.792 --> 01:29:38.792
Number two. I wasn't pissed off
at my dad, even when I was old enough

934
01:29:38.958 --> 01:29:41.625
to know what he and mom were doing
in the bedroom. Number three.

935
01:29:42.417 --> 01:29:44.708
I don't look in the toilet
before I flush it. Number four.

936
01:29:44.917 --> 01:29:48.458
I haven't wet my bed for a long time.
Number five.

937
01:29:50.250 --> 01:29:51.792
Why don't the two of you
go fuck yourselves?

938
01:29:52.375 --> 01:29:53.333
I'm outta here.

939
01:30:01.458 --> 01:30:03.417
What is your problem?
I'm trying to help you.

940
01:30:03.583 --> 01:30:05.333
- Why won't you let me help you?
- I don't want your help. All right?

941
01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:07.083
- I don't need your help.
- Yes, you do.

942
01:30:07.375 --> 01:30:10.667
Something's going on.
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?

943
01:30:11.625 --> 01:30:15.000
- What is this interest you've got in her?
- My interest is in you, not her.

944
01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:17.458
She seduces people,
she manipulates people.

945
01:30:17.625 --> 01:30:19.500
- She'll do anything she can--
- I thought you hardly knew her.

946
01:30:20.250 --> 01:30:22.125
I know the type. I'm a psychologist.

947
01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:25.125
That means
you manipulate people too, Beth?

948
01:30:25.875 --> 01:30:29.125
You're a practicing psychologist.
You're better at it than she is.

949
01:30:31.708 --> 01:30:33.208
I feel sorry for you, Nick.

950
01:31:02.375 --> 01:31:03.292
Catherine!

951
01:31:09.708 --> 01:31:10.625
Catherine!

952
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.542
I should have known. I...

953
01:31:37.958 --> 01:31:42.125
I came into the house...
when you were down on the beach.

954
01:31:44.167 --> 01:31:46.250
She looked at me so strangely.

955
01:31:49.417 --> 01:31:51.167
She left right after you.

956
01:31:59.292 --> 01:32:01.292
I shouldn't have let her watch us.

957
01:32:04.333 --> 01:32:06.333
She wanted to watch me all the time.

958
01:32:13.458 --> 01:32:15.292
She tried to kill you, didn't she?

959
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:19.000
Did you like her to watch you?

960
01:32:19.542 --> 01:32:21.292
Do you think I told her to kill you?

961
01:32:22.125 --> 01:32:23.083
No.

962
01:32:27.083 --> 01:32:31.750
Everybody that I care about dies.

963
01:32:38.792 --> 01:32:40.042
It's okay. It's okay.

964
01:32:47.083 --> 01:32:47.917
It's okay.

965
01:32:52.625 --> 01:32:53.833
Make love to me.

966
01:33:13.917 --> 01:33:15.750
Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?

967
01:33:17.875 --> 01:33:19.625
For what? To set me up?

968
01:33:21.125 --> 01:33:23.000
She loved me. She wouldn't frame me.

969
01:33:24.417 --> 01:33:26.375
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny too.

970
01:33:27.583 --> 01:33:28.458
No, she didn't.

971
01:33:29.333 --> 01:33:31.375
She never got jealous before.

972
01:33:31.833 --> 01:33:33.208
She got excited.

973
01:33:36.958 --> 01:33:38.417
I don't have luck with women.

974
01:33:41.375 --> 01:33:42.417
There was this girl...

975
01:33:43.625 --> 01:33:45.167
I met while I was in college.

976
01:33:46.208 --> 01:33:47.667
I slept with her once.

977
01:33:48.625 --> 01:33:51.125
She started following me around,
taking my picture.

978
01:33:52.625 --> 01:33:55.750
She dyed her hair, copied my clothes.

979
01:33:57.042 --> 01:33:57.958
Lisa...

980
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.833
something Oberman.

981
01:34:06.208 --> 01:34:07.333
It was awful.

982
01:34:10.208 --> 01:34:12.250
I thought you didn't make confessions.

983
01:34:16.417 --> 01:34:17.833
I never did before.

984
01:34:29.167 --> 01:34:30.292
Another nice girl.

985
01:34:49.375 --> 01:34:50.708
How old was she when it happened?

986
01:34:51.083 --> 01:34:52.042
Sixteen.

987
01:34:53.042 --> 01:34:55.292
We seal juvenile records
until they're deceased.

988
01:34:55.667 --> 01:34:57.333
That's why you couldn't find it
in your computer.

989
01:34:58.250 --> 01:34:59.167
What was the motive?

990
01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:03.125
She said she didn't know herself.
Just sort of did it on impulse.

991
01:35:03.625 --> 01:35:04.958
The razor just happened to be there.

992
01:35:06.417 --> 01:35:07.208
It's what she said.

993
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.833
If you want, help yourself to some coffee.

994
01:35:15.042 --> 01:35:15.958
Thanks.

995
01:35:17.125 --> 01:35:19.417
I don't understand
what the hell's going on here, Gus.

996
01:35:19.917 --> 01:35:21.167
Ain't that hard, hos.

997
01:35:21.417 --> 01:35:23.917
This young farm girl got tired
of all that attention

998
01:35:24.083 --> 01:35:26.875
going to her little brothers,
so she fixed them.

999
01:35:28.167 --> 01:35:30.875
Just like ole Hazel Dobkins
fixed her whole family.

1000
01:35:31.125 --> 01:35:33.333
Except young Roxy here
didn't use a wedding present.

1001
01:35:33.917 --> 01:35:35.250
She used daddy's razor.

1002
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:48.292
It sure makes you wonder what they talked
about when they set themselves down

1003
01:35:48.458 --> 01:35:49.958
in front of the campfire at night.

1004
01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:52.708
You ever met a friend of hers
who hasn't killed somebody?

1005
01:35:53.917 --> 01:35:56.292
It must have beat your ordinary,
everyday girl talk.

1006
01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.583
I'm not sure anymore if she did it.

1007
01:35:59.583 --> 01:36:01.333
Which one are we talking about now, hos?

1008
01:36:01.667 --> 01:36:04.542
We know ole Hazel did it.
We know young Roxy did it.

1009
01:36:04.958 --> 01:36:05.875
And the other one...

1010
01:36:06.417 --> 01:36:10.333
Well, she got that magna cum laude pussy
on her that done fried up your brain.

1011
01:36:30.958 --> 01:36:33.250
Oberman, Mark W., Donald M.

1012
01:36:34.583 --> 01:36:35.750
Sorry. No Lisa.

1013
01:36:36.292 --> 01:36:37.375
You sure about the year?

1014
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:41.667
Catherine Tramell graduated in '83. Yeah.

1015
01:36:41.833 --> 01:36:44.292
She said Lisa Oberman
was here at the same time.

1016
01:36:48.458 --> 01:36:49.750
Yeah, we have Tramell.

1017
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:54.833
But no Lisa Oberman.

1018
01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:57.458
Are you sure about that?
There can't be a mistake?

1019
01:36:59.333 --> 01:37:01.417
Only if you're making it, Detective.

1020
01:37:13.833 --> 01:37:14.792
Hi.

1021
01:37:16.333 --> 01:37:18.500
Hazel, this is Nick.
I told you all about him.

1022
01:37:18.958 --> 01:37:20.458
Nick, this is Hazel Dobkins.

1023
01:37:21.167 --> 01:37:24.458
You're the shooter, aren't you?
Well, how are you?

1024
01:37:25.583 --> 01:37:27.875
Fine. Thank you.
Can I speak to you for a minute, please?

1025
01:37:28.583 --> 01:37:30.875
Honey, would you wait for me in the car?
I'll be right there.

1026
01:37:33.792 --> 01:37:34.792
Goodbye, Shooter.

1027
01:37:37.250 --> 01:37:39.000
You like to hang out
with murderers or what?

1028
01:37:40.250 --> 01:37:42.542
- You know that Roxy was--
- Yes, of course I knew.

1029
01:37:43.333 --> 01:37:46.208
Look, I write about unusual people,
and sometimes when I do my research,

1030
01:37:46.375 --> 01:37:47.625
I get involved with them.

1031
01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:49.958
It happened with you.

1032
01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:53.875
Killing isn't like smoking.

1033
01:37:55.333 --> 01:37:56.333
You can quit.

1034
01:37:59.875 --> 01:38:00.917
I've got to go.

1035
01:38:03.458 --> 01:38:05.417
I promised I'd get her home
by six o'clock.

1036
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:07.792
She just loves America's Most Wanted.

1037
01:38:08.375 --> 01:38:11.125
There was no Lisa Oberman
when you were at Berkeley.

1038
01:38:12.042 --> 01:38:14.292
What are you doing? Checking up on me?

1039
01:38:15.417 --> 01:38:16.333
For what?

1040
01:38:17.250 --> 01:38:18.333
I said Hoberman.

1041
01:38:21.417 --> 01:38:23.833
Hoberman. Lisa Hoberman. With an H.

1042
01:38:26.792 --> 01:38:27.625
You do?

1043
01:38:30.750 --> 01:38:31.833
All right. Thank you very much.

1044
01:38:37.708 --> 01:38:39.083
You know I can get
my butt kicked for this.

1045
01:38:39.958 --> 01:38:40.917
You're not even supposed to be in here.

1046
01:38:41.083 --> 01:38:42.500
Come on, Sam.
It's only gonna take a minute.

1047
01:38:42.667 --> 01:38:44.125
Yeah.

1048
01:38:53.125 --> 01:38:54.125
Bring it up.

1049
01:38:57.625 --> 01:38:58.875
It's Dr. Garner, isn't it?

1050
01:39:02.458 --> 01:39:03.500
Bring up '83.

1051
01:39:21.875 --> 01:39:23.125
You shouldn't leave your door open.

1052
01:39:25.667 --> 01:39:28.000
I didn't There's something wrong
with my lock.

1053
01:39:29.042 --> 01:39:29.833
What do you want, Nick?

1054
01:39:30.042 --> 01:39:31.208
Tell me about Catherine.

1055
01:39:34.292 --> 01:39:35.292
She told you, didn't she?

1056
01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.250
What did she tell me, Beth?

1057
01:39:42.375 --> 01:39:44.000
I slept with her once in school.

1058
01:39:45.208 --> 01:39:47.708
I was just a kid. I was experimenting.

1059
01:39:48.625 --> 01:39:49.875
It was just that one time.

1060
01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.750
She developed a fixation on me.

1061
01:39:54.833 --> 01:39:57.750
She styled her hair like mine.
She wore the same kind of clothes I did.

1062
01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.042
It scared me.

1063
01:40:03.083 --> 01:40:04.208
Isn't that what she told you?

1064
01:40:06.042 --> 01:40:07.292
She said it was you.

1065
01:40:08.708 --> 01:40:10.458
You dressed like her,
you dyed your hair blond.

1066
01:40:10.667 --> 01:40:12.750
I did dye my hair.
It had nothing to do with her.

1067
01:40:12.917 --> 01:40:15.208
- I was a redhead for a while too.
- Did you know Noah Goldstein?

1068
01:40:15.417 --> 01:40:16.333
I had him for two classes.

1069
01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:19.167
You saw all the reports, Beth.
Phil copied you. You never said anything.

1070
01:40:19.333 --> 01:40:20.708
Well, what am I supposed to say?

1071
01:40:21.250 --> 01:40:24.375
Hey, guys, I'm not gay,
but I did fuck your suspect.

1072
01:40:26.375 --> 01:40:29.292
I was embarrassed. It was the only time
I've been with a woman.

1073
01:40:32.875 --> 01:40:34.208
She's really sick, you know.

1074
01:40:35.083 --> 01:40:36.125
Do you know what she's doing?

1075
01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.542
She knows I went to Berkeley.
She knows I knew Noah.

1076
01:40:40.333 --> 01:40:42.000
She makes up this story about me.

1077
01:40:42.542 --> 01:40:44.667
She's handing you somebody
who's obsessed with her.

1078
01:40:44.833 --> 01:40:46.792
She didn't hand you to me.
She doesn't even know who you are.

1079
01:40:46.958 --> 01:40:48.417
She told me about a, uh, Lisa Hoberman.

1080
01:40:48.625 --> 01:40:51.750
She knows you'd find out
who Lisa Hoberman is. You're a good cop.

1081
01:40:53.333 --> 01:40:54.375
Did she tell you casually?

1082
01:40:55.333 --> 01:40:56.542
Make it seem irrelevant?

1083
01:40:59.125 --> 01:41:00.542
I mean, did she tell you in bed, Nick?

1084
01:41:04.625 --> 01:41:05.625
That's what I'd do.

1085
01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:10.500
Why did you change your name?

1086
01:41:11.292 --> 01:41:13.417
I got married. He called me Beth.

1087
01:41:14.375 --> 01:41:16.458
He was on staff at the clinic
down in Salinas.

1088
01:41:17.250 --> 01:41:18.167
Didn't last long.

1089
01:41:21.042 --> 01:41:25.042
Nick! God, do you really think
that I could kill someone?

1090
01:41:25.208 --> 01:41:26.833
I mean, I never even met Johnny Boz.

1091
01:41:27.042 --> 01:41:28.042
And what about Nilsen?

1092
01:41:28.208 --> 01:41:30.458
What possible motive
would I have to kill Nilsen?

1093
01:41:30.625 --> 01:41:31.792
You should get that lock fixed.

1094
01:41:32.167 --> 01:41:33.042
God!

1095
01:41:33.583 --> 01:41:36.167
She is evil. She is brilliant.

1096
01:42:02.042 --> 01:42:03.125
Did I scare you?

1097
01:42:04.625 --> 01:42:05.833
I wanted to surprise you.

1098
01:42:06.958 --> 01:42:07.958
What's wrong?

1099
01:42:08.458 --> 01:42:09.708
I found Lisa Hoberman.

1100
01:42:10.125 --> 01:42:11.333
Oh, you did? What is she doing?

1101
01:42:15.417 --> 01:42:17.250
Are you not gonna tell me
what she's doing?

1102
01:42:18.250 --> 01:42:20.583
- I thought we were done playing games.
- I did too.

1103
01:42:21.625 --> 01:42:23.250
She said you got it backwards.

1104
01:42:23.542 --> 01:42:25.708
She said you even styled your hair
like she did.

1105
01:42:26.792 --> 01:42:27.833
And you believed her?

1106
01:42:29.542 --> 01:42:32.667
I had to go down to the campus police
and file a report about her.

1107
01:42:35.250 --> 01:42:37.708
I suppose you still think
I kill people too, right?

1108
01:42:39.292 --> 01:42:40.208
No.

1109
01:42:42.917 --> 01:42:43.917
Liar.

1110
01:42:48.833 --> 01:42:51.458
- So who'd you say you're with?
- Homicide. San Francisco.

1111
01:42:54.875 --> 01:42:55.833
Here we go.

1112
01:42:57.375 --> 01:42:58.250
Kind of.

1113
01:42:59.125 --> 01:43:02.542
There was a report about a Lisa Hoberman,
January 1980, but it's outta here.

1114
01:43:02.708 --> 01:43:03.583
Who's got it?

1115
01:43:05.375 --> 01:43:08.042
One of your guys, Nilsen. You know him?

1116
01:43:08.792 --> 01:43:10.667
Yeah. Thanks a lot.

1117
01:43:12.125 --> 01:43:14.417
Yeah. Tell him to bring it back, will you?
He's had it a whole year.

1118
01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:18.542
So Nilsen had a report on Beth. So what?
You don't know what the hell was in it?

1119
01:43:18.708 --> 01:43:19.833
Catherine told me what was in it.

1120
01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.667
- If she's telling you the truth.
- Oh, Gus, don't you get it?

1121
01:43:23.042 --> 01:43:25.042
If Beth killed Johnny Boz
to frame Catherine,

1122
01:43:25.208 --> 01:43:27.000
she wouldn't want anybody
to know what happened in Berkeley.

1123
01:43:27.167 --> 01:43:30.042
But Nilsen found out about it.
And that gives her the motive to kill him.

1124
01:43:30.583 --> 01:43:33.208
Well, how did she know Nilsen found out,
if it happened?

1125
01:43:33.375 --> 01:43:35.417
He was IA. He-he probably asked her.

1126
01:43:35.667 --> 01:43:38.292
She'd have to be nuttier
than a 20 pound Christmas fruitcake.

1127
01:43:38.458 --> 01:43:41.083
She's not the one who hangs out
with multiple murderers,

1128
01:43:41.292 --> 01:43:42.917
- your girlfriend is.
- She's a writer, all right.

1129
01:43:43.083 --> 01:43:44.583
- That's her job.
- I don't buy it.

1130
01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:46.958
There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley
who knows what the hell happened.

1131
01:43:47.125 --> 01:43:48.958
I know what happened, all right.
Catherine told me.

1132
01:43:49.125 --> 01:43:52.250
-And everything she says has checked out.
-You got goddamn tweety-birds

1133
01:43:52.417 --> 01:43:53.250
- Fuck you, man.
- fluttering around in your head.

1134
01:43:53.417 --> 01:43:54.250
- That's what you got.
- Fuck it!

1135
01:43:54.542 --> 01:43:58.208
You think you can fuck like minks,
raise rugrats and live happily ever after?

1136
01:43:58.667 --> 01:43:59.792
Oh man!

1137
01:44:13.150 --> 01:44:14.150
How'd you get in here?

1138
01:44:15.775 --> 01:44:17.608
What's, uh, what's this?

1139
01:44:17.942 --> 01:44:19.692
I decided to give you a second chance.

1140
01:44:20.983 --> 01:44:21.983
I missed you.

1141
01:44:22.192 --> 01:44:24.108
I wasn't gone long enough
for you to miss me.

1142
01:44:25.317 --> 01:44:26.317
Did you miss me?

1143
01:44:27.442 --> 01:44:28.400
No.

1144
01:44:31.483 --> 01:44:32.442
Now?

1145
01:44:35.233 --> 01:44:36.108
No.

1146
01:44:39.067 --> 01:44:40.983
Why don't you come over here
and tell me no?

1147
01:44:45.983 --> 01:44:47.150
I've seen 'em before.

1148
01:44:47.650 --> 01:44:49.567
Yeah? Well, you might not see 'em again.

1149
01:44:51.067 --> 01:44:52.525
My book's nearly finished.

1150
01:44:53.025 --> 01:44:55.025
And my detective's almost dead.

1151
01:44:55.608 --> 01:44:58.525
- So I got time for a last cigarette?
- Afterwards.

1152
01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:13.442
I've got to do some research
tomorrow morning.

1153
01:45:14.275 --> 01:45:16.025
I'm good at research. I'll help you.

1154
01:45:17.275 --> 01:45:18.192
No thanks.

1155
01:45:19.192 --> 01:45:20.275
What are you researching?

1156
01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:24.483
Oh. A new ending to your book.

1157
01:45:25.817 --> 01:45:28.108
Oh really? What's the twist?

1158
01:45:28.858 --> 01:45:31.858
- The detective falls for the wrong girl...
- Uh-huh.

1159
01:45:32.858 --> 01:45:33.900
...but he doesn't die.

1160
01:45:37.358 --> 01:45:38.567
So what happens to them?

1161
01:45:41.442 --> 01:45:46.733
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats,
and live happily ever after.

1162
01:45:48.525 --> 01:45:49.525
It won't sell.

1163
01:45:51.858 --> 01:45:52.650
Why not?

1164
01:45:54.692 --> 01:45:55.942
Somebody has to die.

1165
01:45:59.733 --> 01:46:00.692
Why?

1166
01:46:02.608 --> 01:46:03.983
Somebody always does.

1167
01:46:22.525 --> 01:46:24.692
Good morning.
I'm looking for a Dr. Garner.

1168
01:46:24.858 --> 01:46:26.275
Oh, she doesn't work here anymore.

1169
01:46:26.525 --> 01:46:28.567
I think she's up in San Francisco
with the police.

1170
01:46:28.733 --> 01:46:31.483
Actually, I'm looking for her husband.
He works here too, doesn't he?

1171
01:46:31.900 --> 01:46:33.317
- Dr. Joseph Garner?
- Yeah.

1172
01:46:33.692 --> 01:46:35.025
- Was she married?
- You know him?

1173
01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:37.567
He died about five or six years ago.

1174
01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:40.692
- How did he die?
- He was shot.

1175
01:46:44.358 --> 01:46:45.275
Thank you.

1176
01:46:48.692 --> 01:46:49.858
He was walking home from work.

1177
01:46:50.608 --> 01:46:52.317
They only lived a couple of blocks
away from the clinic.

1178
01:46:53.192 --> 01:46:55.733
- Somebody just drove by and shot him.
- What was the murder weapon?

1179
01:46:56.025 --> 01:46:59.108
Revolver, .38. Unrecovered.
Watch yourself.

1180
01:46:59.650 --> 01:47:00.650
Were there any suspects?

1181
01:47:01.150 --> 01:47:04.192
No suspects, no motive. Unsolved.

1182
01:47:04.692 --> 01:47:06.192
Was his wife ever a suspect?

1183
01:47:08.650 --> 01:47:11.483
You know, one of your guys was down here
from 'Frisco, about a year ago.

1184
01:47:11.775 --> 01:47:13.650
He was asking the same exact thing.

1185
01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:16.067
Do you mind telling me
what the hell is going on?

1186
01:47:16.233 --> 01:47:18.275
- Routine.
- Routine?

1187
01:47:18.942 --> 01:47:20.400
Yeah. That's exactly what he said.

1188
01:47:20.983 --> 01:47:23.650
Now I got two of you guys come down here
and telling me it's "routine".

1189
01:47:24.150 --> 01:47:25.733
Do you remember
what the other guy's name was?

1190
01:47:27.358 --> 01:47:30.692
No. Can't really say that I do.

1191
01:47:31.608 --> 01:47:32.567
Nilsen?

1192
01:47:34.275 --> 01:47:35.650
Nilsen. Yeah, that was it.

1193
01:47:38.692 --> 01:47:40.942
- So was she ever a suspect?
- Nope.

1194
01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:45.067
There was some talk,
but it never panned out.

1195
01:47:45.983 --> 01:47:46.900
What kind of talk?

1196
01:47:48.108 --> 01:47:48.942
Girlfriend.

1197
01:47:49.567 --> 01:47:50.608
What? He had a girlfriend?

1198
01:47:51.733 --> 01:47:52.525
No.

1199
01:47:54.733 --> 01:47:55.608
She did.

1200
01:47:58.483 --> 01:47:59.275
Like I said,

1201
01:47:59.733 --> 01:48:00.692
it never panned out.

1202
01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:06.150
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Hope I helped you out.

1203
01:48:06.733 --> 01:48:09.400
Yes, you did. You sure did.

1204
01:48:12.742 --> 01:48:13.617
Catherine!

1205
01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:42.408
Hi. I missed you.

1206
01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:46.450
I finished my research.

1207
01:48:46.617 --> 01:48:48.033
- I finished my book.
- Yeah?

1208
01:48:48.867 --> 01:48:49.742
So how does it end?

1209
01:48:50.908 --> 01:48:53.783
I told you. She kills him.

1210
01:48:57.533 --> 01:48:58.533
Goodbye, Nick.

1211
01:49:01.325 --> 01:49:02.325
Goodbye?

1212
01:49:03.658 --> 01:49:05.908
Yeah. I finished my book.

1213
01:49:08.742 --> 01:49:11.950
Didn't you hear me? Your character's dead.

1214
01:49:14.450 --> 01:49:15.533
Goodbye.

1215
01:49:20.575 --> 01:49:24.075
What do you want? Flowers?
I'll send you an autographed copy.

1216
01:49:26.617 --> 01:49:28.242
What is this? Some kind of joke?

1217
01:49:33.950 --> 01:49:35.117
You playing a game here?

1218
01:49:36.492 --> 01:49:37.575
Games are over.

1219
01:49:39.950 --> 01:49:44.783
You were right.
It was the fuck of the century, Shooter.

1220
01:49:49.992 --> 01:49:50.950
Catherine?

1221
01:49:59.450 --> 01:50:00.325
I'll be right there.

1222
01:50:28.325 --> 01:50:31.117
Catherine Tramell's roommate,
freshman year. I just got a call from her.

1223
01:50:31.283 --> 01:50:32.908
She's over in Oakland. Come on.

1224
01:50:36.325 --> 01:50:38.408
I've been phoning people
from her dorm all day.

1225
01:50:38.575 --> 01:50:40.033
She must have heard
I was trying to reach her.

1226
01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:43.325
She says she knows all about Catherine
and Lisa Hoberman.

1227
01:50:46.825 --> 01:50:47.908
You feeling okay?

1228
01:50:48.533 --> 01:50:49.492
Yeah.

1229
01:50:50.283 --> 01:50:51.200
Here's something else.

1230
01:50:51.742 --> 01:50:54.950
Johnny Boz's psychiatrist
has an office on Van Ness.

1231
01:50:55.325 --> 01:50:59.158
Guess who he shares office space with?
Doctor Elizabeth Garner.

1232
01:51:02.700 --> 01:51:03.992
What in hell's the matter with you?

1233
01:51:06.367 --> 01:51:07.200
Hmm?

1234
01:51:19.492 --> 01:51:21.283
I'll be in Suite 405.

1235
01:51:24.242 --> 01:51:26.367
- Where the hell are you going?
- Going with you.

1236
01:51:26.783 --> 01:51:29.575
You're on leave, hos.
It ain't gonna take long.

1237
01:52:46.325 --> 01:52:47.283
Gus!

1238
01:53:17.617 --> 01:53:18.450
Gus!

1239
01:53:34.375 --> 01:53:35.292
Gus.

1240
01:53:54.083 --> 01:53:54.917
Freeze!

1241
01:53:55.833 --> 01:53:56.917
What are you doing here?

1242
01:53:57.125 --> 01:53:58.833
Put your hands up.
Put your fucking hands up.

1243
01:53:59.042 --> 01:54:01.500
I got a message on my machine
to meet Gus here. Where is he?

1244
01:54:01.667 --> 01:54:03.208
Don't move. Don't you move.

1245
01:54:03.583 --> 01:54:05.917
I know about your husband.
You still like girls, Beth?

1246
01:54:07.167 --> 01:54:08.083
What?

1247
01:54:09.625 --> 01:54:10.542
Take your hands out of your pockets.

1248
01:54:11.208 --> 01:54:12.917
- Take 'em out!
- What's wrong with you?

1249
01:54:13.125 --> 01:54:13.792
Take 'em out.

1250
01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:35.500
I loved you.

1251
01:54:52.750 --> 01:54:54.042
Oh, God!

1252
01:55:17.875 --> 01:55:19.125
What makes you think she had a gun?

1253
01:55:21.917 --> 01:55:23.875
What the hell was she doing here?
What was Gus doing here?

1254
01:55:26.208 --> 01:55:27.083
Nick?

1255
01:55:29.042 --> 01:55:30.000
Lieutenant.

1256
01:55:59.583 --> 01:56:00.375
One of ours.

1257
01:56:03.208 --> 01:56:04.125
Jesus.

1258
01:56:05.833 --> 01:56:07.167
We'll have to check Beth's apartment.

1259
01:56:11.625 --> 01:56:12.917
Thirty-eight caliber revolver.

1260
01:56:13.125 --> 01:56:14.458
In the bookcase behind some books.

1261
01:56:18.500 --> 01:56:19.792
Have ballistics check it for Nilsen.

1262
01:56:21.708 --> 01:56:23.542
Lieutenant,
you'd better come in here.

1263
01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:54.458
I guess that's it.

1264
01:57:15.833 --> 01:57:17.375
We checked. It's her size.

1265
01:57:17.917 --> 01:57:20.125
She must've heard you on the stairway
and dumped the stuff.

1266
01:57:20.292 --> 01:57:21.958
There's no suite 405
in that building.

1267
01:57:22.125 --> 01:57:23.917
Catherine Tramell's roommate
in her freshman year is dead.

1268
01:57:24.083 --> 01:57:25.667
She died of leukemia two years ago.

1269
01:57:25.833 --> 01:57:27.917
- Here's a fax of her death certificate.
- Okay, but what about Salinas?

1270
01:57:28.750 --> 01:57:29.708
Yeah?

1271
01:57:30.500 --> 01:57:31.708
Hold on. Jack?

1272
01:57:32.458 --> 01:57:35.542
Jack! Did you check Nilsen's office
for any files on Beth Garner?

1273
01:57:35.708 --> 01:57:37.250
- No police report from Berkeley.
- Yeah?

1274
01:57:37.417 --> 01:57:39.208
- Nothing at all about Salinas.
- Okay.

1275
01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:41.333
I'm back. Yeah.

1276
01:57:42.250 --> 01:57:43.125
Great.

1277
01:57:44.042 --> 01:57:47.250
Ballistics says the .38 we found
in her apartment was used on Nilsen.

1278
01:57:47.500 --> 01:57:49.583
No registration.
They're checking with Salinas.

1279
01:57:49.917 --> 01:57:52.583
The icepick was the same brand
and model as the Boz weapon.

1280
01:57:52.792 --> 01:57:55.167
We checked the tape machines
at Dr. Garner's apartment and her office,

1281
01:57:55.333 --> 01:57:58.250
both here and the one on Van Ness.
There's no message from Gus on any of 'em.

1282
01:57:58.417 --> 01:58:00.208
The tape in her apartment was unused.

1283
01:58:00.542 --> 01:58:04.042
And Johnny Boz's psychiatrist says
he thinks he remembers Dr. Garner and Boz

1284
01:58:04.208 --> 01:58:07.250
meeting at a Christmas party
at his house a year ago.

1285
01:58:11.292 --> 01:58:12.750
You just can't tell about people, can you.

1286
01:58:16.125 --> 01:58:17.917
Even the ones
you think you know inside and out.

1287
01:58:23.583 --> 01:58:24.875
Congratulations, Curran.

1288
01:59:18.758 --> 01:59:19.758
Hi.

1289
01:59:26.050 --> 01:59:27.217
I heard about what happened...

1290
01:59:30.217 --> 01:59:31.133
on TV.

1291
01:59:44.092 --> 01:59:46.633
I can't allow myself to care about you.

1292
01:59:51.092 --> 01:59:52.550
I can't allow myself...

1293
01:59:54.050 --> 01:59:54.967
to care...

1294
01:59:59.675 --> 02:00:04.342
I don't wanna do this.
Please, I don't wanna do this. I...

1295
02:00:06.383 --> 02:00:07.842
I lose everybody.

1296
02:00:09.175 --> 02:00:10.467
I don't wanna lose you.

1297
02:00:17.883 --> 02:00:19.175
I don't wanna lose you.

1298
02:01:57.842 --> 02:01:59.300
What do we do now, Nick?

1299
02:02:01.217 --> 02:02:02.675
Fuck like minks...

1300
02:02:04.967 --> 02:02:07.717
raise rugrats and live happily ever after.

1301
02:02:19.508 --> 02:02:20.758
I hate rugrats.

1302
02:02:23.967 --> 02:02:28.467
Fuck like minks, forget the rugrats,
and live happily ever after.
