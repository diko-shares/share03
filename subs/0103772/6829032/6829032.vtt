1
00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:17.082
Oh, God. Oh.

2
00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:32.749
- How are you doing, Nick?
- Hi.

3
00:04:36.707 --> 00:04:37.707
Morning, detective.

4
00:04:38.582 --> 00:04:39.748
You got to get back, folks.

5
00:04:40.666 --> 00:04:41.832
- Howdy.
- Morning.

6
00:04:45.166 --> 00:04:46.082
Up there.

7
00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:52.998
- How's it going, guys?
- Morning, Pete.

8
00:04:53.957 --> 00:04:55.165
Who was this fuckin' guy?

9
00:04:55.332 --> 00:04:57.665
Rock and roll, Gus.
Johnny Boz.

10
00:04:58.124 --> 00:05:00.040
- I never heard of him.
- Before your time, cowboy.

11
00:05:00.207 --> 00:05:02.248
- Hey, Ronnie. Where are they hiding?
- Upstairs, to the right.

12
00:05:02.666 --> 00:05:06.291
Mid-sixties. He had five or six hits.
He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.

13
00:05:06.457 --> 00:05:07.540
Not now he don't.

14
00:05:09.957 --> 00:05:11.665
- Do we have a time of death.
- Almost.

15
00:05:11.832 --> 00:05:14.040
- You guys know Captain Talcott?
- Sure.

16
00:05:14.332 --> 00:05:16.457
- What's the Chief's office doin' here.
- Observing.

17
00:05:19.582 --> 00:05:20.582
What's it say, doc?

18
00:05:20.832 --> 00:05:23.040
Ninety-two degrees.
It's about six hours.

19
00:05:23.791 --> 00:05:26.124
Put's time of death around,
uh, 2 a.m. plus or minus.

20
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:27.874
Can somebody close the drapes over there?

21
00:05:29.082 --> 00:05:30.957
- Geez, what a mess.
- Maid came in about an hour ago.

22
00:05:31.124 --> 00:05:33.207
Found the body.
She's not a live-in.

23
00:05:33.624 --> 00:05:34.582
Maybe the maid did it.

24
00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:37.165
She's 54 years old
and weighs 240 pounds.

25
00:05:37.332 --> 00:05:38.457
No bruises on the body.

26
00:05:38.916 --> 00:05:40.457
- It ain't the maid.
- Never know.

27
00:05:45.124 --> 00:05:46.040
Sorry.

28
00:05:46.624 --> 00:05:48.749
He left the club with his
girlfriend about midnight.

29
00:05:48.916 --> 00:05:50.082
That's the last time anybody saw him.

30
00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:51.332
- What was it?
- Ice pick.

31
00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:53.290
Left it on the coffee table
in the living room.

32
00:05:56.457 --> 00:05:58.790
There's come stains
all over the sheets.

33
00:06:07.332 --> 00:06:08.248
Very impressive.

34
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:10.124
He got off before he got offed.

35
00:06:10.832 --> 00:06:12.540
Gentlemen, this is sensitive.

36
00:06:12.832 --> 00:06:15.498
Mr. Boz was a major contributor
to the mayor's campaign.

37
00:06:15.666 --> 00:06:17.707
He was Chairman of the Board
of the Palace of Fine Arts--

38
00:06:17.874 --> 00:06:19.665
I thought you said
he was a rock and roll star.

39
00:06:19.832 --> 00:06:22.207
He was a retired rock and roll star.

40
00:06:22.374 --> 00:06:25.499
A civic-minded,
very respectable rock and roll star.

41
00:06:25.666 --> 00:06:26.832
What's that over there?

42
00:06:30.416 --> 00:06:32.791
It looks like some civic-minded,
very respectable cocaine.

43
00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:38.457
Listen to me, Curran.
I'm gonna get a lot of heat on this.

44
00:06:39.207 --> 00:06:40.665
I don't want any mistakes.

45
00:06:46.707 --> 00:06:48.373
What's Boz's girlfriend's name?

46
00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:52.999
Catherine Tramell,
162 Divisadero.

47
00:07:00.416 --> 00:07:01.582
Always a pleasure, Captain.

48
00:07:01.874 --> 00:07:03.332
He's up bright and early.

49
00:07:03.499 --> 00:07:06.415
He doesn't usually punch in
till after his 18 holes.

50
00:07:06.666 --> 00:07:08.332
Johnny and the mayor
must have been very tight.

51
00:07:08.707 --> 00:07:09.748
- Hey.
- Yo.

52
00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:11.374
Keep your three o'clock.

53
00:07:11.874 --> 00:07:12.707
Do you want me to work the case, Phil--

54
00:07:12.874 --> 00:07:14.540
- I said keep it.
- All right.

55
00:07:15.374 --> 00:07:16.249
I'll keep it.

56
00:07:50.166 --> 00:07:52.374
Morning. I'm Detective Curran,
this is Detective Moran.

57
00:07:52.582 --> 00:07:54.373
San Francisco Police Department.

58
00:07:54.624 --> 00:07:56.790
We'd like to speak to a Ms.
Catherine Tramell, please.

59
00:07:58.457 --> 00:07:59.415
Come in.

60
00:08:05.832 --> 00:08:07.998
Sit, please. Just a moment.

61
00:08:14.707 --> 00:08:17.498
Ain't that cute?
They got his and hers Picasso's.

62
00:08:17.832 --> 00:08:19.707
Gus, I didn't even know
you knew who Picasso was.

63
00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:21.290
Sure I do.
It says right here.

64
00:08:21.582 --> 00:08:22.707
Hers is bigger.

65
00:08:34.166 --> 00:08:35.082
Sorry to bother you.

66
00:08:35.291 --> 00:08:37.291
Just got a couple of questions to ask.

67
00:08:37.999 --> 00:08:39.874
- Are you vice?
- No, we're homicide.

68
00:08:40.166 --> 00:08:41.124
What do you want?

69
00:08:42.166 --> 00:08:44.541
When was the last time you saw John Boz?

70
00:08:45.957 --> 00:08:46.832
Is he dead?

71
00:08:49.082 --> 00:08:50.415
Why do you think he's dead?

72
00:08:50.832 --> 00:08:52.998
Well, you wouldn't be here
otherwise, would you?

73
00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:54.707
Were you with him last night?

74
00:08:57.291 --> 00:08:58.791
You're looking for Catherine,
not me.

75
00:09:01.957 --> 00:09:02.790
Who are you?

76
00:09:03.332 --> 00:09:04.248
I'm Roxy.

77
00:09:06.124 --> 00:09:07.124
I'm her friend.

78
00:09:12.207 --> 00:09:14.207
Well, Roxy, do you know
where your friend is?

79
00:09:16.666 --> 00:09:20.666
She's out at the beach house at Stinson.
Seadrift. 1402.

80
00:09:22.166 --> 00:09:23.499
Thanks.

81
00:09:25.916 --> 00:09:27.332
You're wasting your time.

82
00:09:30.374 --> 00:09:31.790
Catherine didn't kill him.

83
00:10:23.249 --> 00:10:24.124
Gus...

84
00:10:47.624 --> 00:10:48.624
Ms. Tramell?

85
00:11:07.082 --> 00:11:09.748
Good afternoon. I'm Detective Curran,
this is Detective Moran.

86
00:11:09.916 --> 00:11:11.874
- We're with the San Francisco Police--
- I know who you are.

87
00:11:15.124 --> 00:11:16.332
So how did he die?

88
00:11:16.541 --> 00:11:17.541
He was murdered.

89
00:11:18.207 --> 00:11:19.040
Obviously.

90
00:11:20.249 --> 00:11:22.707
- How was he murdered?
- With an ice pick.

91
00:11:27.332 --> 00:11:28.165
How long were you dating him?

92
00:11:30.499 --> 00:11:33.249
I wasn't dating him.
I was fucking him.

93
00:11:36.041 --> 00:11:37.082
What are you? A pro?

94
00:11:38.541 --> 00:11:39.874
No. I'm an amateur.

95
00:11:41.624 --> 00:11:43.290
How long were you having sex with him?

96
00:11:43.916 --> 00:11:44.832
About a year and a half.

97
00:11:45.582 --> 00:11:47.498
- Were you with him last night?
- Yes.

98
00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:48.915
Did you leave the club with him?

99
00:11:49.332 --> 00:11:51.123
- Yes.
- Did you go home with him?

100
00:11:51.457 --> 00:11:55.040
No. We had a drink at the club.
We left together.

101
00:11:55.541 --> 00:11:57.332
He went home and I came out here.

102
00:11:57.541 --> 00:11:59.624
Was there anyone with you last night?

103
00:12:00.166 --> 00:12:03.207
No.
I wasn't in the mood last night.

104
00:12:11.207 --> 00:12:13.165
Let me ask you something,
Ms. Tramell?

105
00:12:15.416 --> 00:12:16.791
Are you sorry he's dead?

106
00:12:17.957 --> 00:12:20.623
Yeah. I liked fucking him.

107
00:12:27.166 --> 00:12:28.916
Look, I don't really feel
like talking anymore.

108
00:12:30.707 --> 00:12:32.915
Listen, lady,
we can do this downtown if you want.

109
00:12:33.374 --> 00:12:36.915
So read me my rights and arrest me,
and then I'll go downtown.

110
00:12:42.624 --> 00:12:44.499
Otherwise, get the fuck out of here.

111
00:12:52.874 --> 00:12:53.749
Please?

112
00:13:18.082 --> 00:13:18.957
Nice girl.

113
00:13:36.082 --> 00:13:37.957
I'm sorry, Beth.
I got hung up in Stinson.

114
00:13:41.541 --> 00:13:42.499
How are you, Nick?

115
00:13:43.166 --> 00:13:44.082
I'm fine.

116
00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:46.749
Oh, come on, Beth.
You know I'm fine.

117
00:13:46.957 --> 00:13:47.998
How long we gotta keep doing this?

118
00:13:48.166 --> 00:13:51.666
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to,
I suppose. Have a seat.

119
00:13:51.832 --> 00:13:53.165
It's bullshit, okay.
You know it is.

120
00:13:53.332 --> 00:13:57.832
I know it is, but sit down anyway
so we can get it over with, okay?

121
00:14:06.082 --> 00:14:08.373
So, how are things?

122
00:14:09.874 --> 00:14:14.165
Things are fine. I told you,
all right. Things are fine.

123
00:14:14.916 --> 00:14:16.041
How is your personal life?

124
00:14:16.874 --> 00:14:18.499
My sex life is fine.

125
00:14:20.957 --> 00:14:23.748
My sex life is actually pretty
shitty since I stopped seeing you.

126
00:14:28.582 --> 00:14:30.123
Started developing calluses.

127
00:14:35.124 --> 00:14:36.040
Sorry.

128
00:14:38.874 --> 00:14:39.874
How's the booze?

129
00:14:40.499 --> 00:14:41.957
Haven't had a drink in three months.

130
00:14:42.916 --> 00:14:44.332
- What about the coke?
- No.

131
00:14:44.832 --> 00:14:45.790
No?

132
00:14:45.999 --> 00:14:49.374
No. No, I'm working my ass off,
I'm off the sauce.

133
00:14:50.332 --> 00:14:51.498
I even stopped smoking.

134
00:14:53.791 --> 00:14:54.832
How's not smoking?

135
00:14:55.499 --> 00:14:56.499
It sucks.

136
00:14:59.374 --> 00:15:02.957
Now, will you tell IA I'm just your
average healthy, totally fucked up cop,

137
00:15:03.624 --> 00:15:04.624
and let me outta here?

138
00:15:05.457 --> 00:15:06.373
Please?

139
00:15:13.124 --> 00:15:14.124
Yes.

140
00:15:15.916 --> 00:15:16.874
Thank you.

141
00:15:26.624 --> 00:15:27.874
I still miss you, Nick.

142
00:15:37.707 --> 00:15:38.790
- Hey, how you doing, Nick?
- Hi.

143
00:15:40.791 --> 00:15:42.791
Talcott's in there.
They're waiting. How'd it go?

144
00:15:43.332 --> 00:15:44.248
She misses me.

145
00:15:45.207 --> 00:15:46.957
Boy, when that girl mates,
it's for life.

146
00:15:47.874 --> 00:15:49.540
All right.
Let's start. Harrigan.

147
00:15:49.874 --> 00:15:52.499
Well, we got 31 stab wounds,
neck and the chest.

148
00:15:52.666 --> 00:15:55.207
No usable prints,
no forcible entry, nothing missing.

149
00:15:55.374 --> 00:15:58.665
No prints on the ice pick either.
You can pick it up at any K-mart.

150
00:15:59.207 --> 00:16:02.082
The scarf was Hermes.
It's expensive.

151
00:16:02.249 --> 00:16:05.040
They sell about 20,000 a year, worldwide.

152
00:16:05.416 --> 00:16:08.291
The powder was cocaine,
high-- quality, high-content.

153
00:16:08.457 --> 00:16:12.082
He inhaled it; there were minute
quantities on his lips and penis.

Liked his drugs,
he liked his girls,

157
00:16:19.582 --> 00:16:22.540
- he liked his rock and roll.
- He liked the mayor, too, right?

158
00:16:28.249 --> 00:16:29.915
What about his girlfriend?

159
00:16:30.207 --> 00:16:32.082
Is she relevant here?
Is she a suspect?

160
00:16:32.249 --> 00:16:34.332
- She's a suspect.
- On what basis?

00:17:08.332 --> 00:17:10.540
And she's got a degree in
screwing with peoples' heads.

175
00:17:10.916 --> 00:17:13.291
You forgot about her degree in literature.
She's a writer.

176
00:17:13.749 --> 00:17:15.665
She published a novel last
year under a pen name.

177
00:17:15.832 --> 00:17:16.873
Wanna know what it's about?

178
00:17:18.624 --> 00:17:21.624
It's about a retired rock and roll star
who gets murdered by his girlfriend.

179
00:17:35.457 --> 00:17:37.040
Page 67, cowboy.

180
00:17:38.166 --> 00:17:39.541
You know how she does the boyfriend?

181
00:17:40.582 --> 00:17:41.498
With an icepick...

182
00:17:42.499 --> 00:17:43.874
in bed...

183
00:17:44.374 --> 00:17:46.832
his hands tied with a white silk scarf.

184
00:17:52.207 --> 00:17:53.123
Dr. Garner?

185
00:17:55.499 --> 00:17:58.749
I've asked Dr. Lamott to consult with us.
This isn't really my turf.

186
00:17:59.416 --> 00:18:02.791
Dr. Lamott teaches the pathology of
psychopathic behavior at Stanford

187
00:18:02.957 --> 00:18:03.707
and is also a member

188
00:18:03.874 --> 00:18:05.957
of the Justice Department's
Psychological Profile team.

189
00:18:06.457 --> 00:18:07.332
Dr. Lamott?

190
00:18:10.249 --> 00:18:11.749
I see two possibilities.

191
00:18:12.499 --> 00:18:16.040
One. The person who wrote
this book is your murderer

192
00:18:16.499 --> 00:18:20.040
and acted out the killing described
in ritualistic, literal detail.

193
00:18:20.624 --> 00:18:23.624
Two.
Someone who wants to harm the writer

194
00:18:23.832 --> 00:18:26.998
read the book and enacted the killing
described to incriminate her.

195
00:18:27.541 --> 00:18:29.582
What if the writer did it?
Then what are we dealing with?

196
00:18:30.916 --> 00:18:33.249
You're dealing with a devious,
diabolical mind.

197
00:18:33.957 --> 00:18:36.998
You see, this book had to have
been written at least six months,

198
00:18:37.166 --> 00:18:39.457
maybe even years,
before it was published.

199
00:18:40.207 --> 00:18:42.082
Which means that the writer had to
have at least planned the crime,

200
00:18:42.249 --> 00:18:43.749
in the subconscious,
back then.

201
00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:45.957
Now, the fact that she carried it out

202
00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:50.332
indicates psychopathic obsessive behavior
in terms not only of the killing itself,

203
00:18:50.624 --> 00:18:53.540
but also in terms of the applied
advance defense mechanism.

204
00:18:55.582 --> 00:18:57.873
You know,
sometimes I can't tell shit from shinola,

205
00:18:58.082 --> 00:18:58.832
Doc.

206
00:18:59.582 --> 00:19:00.873
What was all that you just said?

207
00:19:01.082 --> 00:19:03.498
- She intended the book to be her alibi.
- Correct.

208
00:19:04.124 --> 00:19:06.332
She's gonna say, "Do you think
I'd be dumb enough to kill anyone

209
00:19:06.541 --> 00:19:08.374
in the exact way I described in my book?

210
00:19:09.041 --> 00:19:10.916
I wouldn't do that,
because then I know I'd be the suspect.”

211
00:19:11.416 --> 00:19:13.541
So what if it's not the writer?
What if it's, uh...

212
00:19:13.707 --> 00:19:14.790
someone who read the book?

213
00:19:16.666 --> 00:19:18.916
You're dealing then
with someone so obsessed

214
00:19:19.582 --> 00:19:23.582
that he, or she, is willing to kill
an irrelevant and innocent victim

215
00:19:23.874 --> 00:19:26.457
in order to place the blame on
the person who wrote that book.

216
00:19:27.124 --> 00:19:30.374
I'm talking about a deep-seeded,
obsessional hatred;

217
00:19:30.916 --> 00:19:33.124
and an utter lack of respect
for human life.

218
00:19:39.916 --> 00:19:42.874
So we got a once-in-a-lifetime,
top-of-the-line

219
00:19:43.082 --> 00:19:45.957
loony-tune either way you cut it.
That's what you're saying, right, Doc?

220
00:19:48.374 --> 00:19:50.249
You're dealing with someone
very dangerous...

221
00:19:51.874 --> 00:19:52.999
and very ill.

222
00:19:58.832 --> 00:20:00.665
Come on, you know
there's no case here.

223
00:20:00.832 --> 00:20:02.373
You've got no physical evidence.

224
00:20:02.624 --> 00:20:03.832
She hasn't got an alibi.

225
00:20:03.999 --> 00:20:06.707
Okay, she hasn't got an alibi,
she hasn't got a motive either.

226
00:20:07.332 --> 00:20:10.915
Believe me. Her defense would just beat
us to death with this copycat thing.

227
00:20:11.082 --> 00:20:12.957
Anybody who read the book
could have done it.

228
00:20:14.707 --> 00:20:16.707
So what do you wanna do now?
Nothing?

229
00:20:17.749 --> 00:20:18.874
We call her in for questioning.

230
00:20:19.041 --> 00:20:21.041
She's got enough money to burn
this whole department down.

231
00:20:21.207 --> 00:20:24.082
She was the last person
seen with the guy, Captain Talcott.

232
00:20:24.249 --> 00:20:25.665
I'll take the responsibility.

233
00:20:27.207 --> 00:20:28.332
It's yours.

234
00:20:31.291 --> 00:20:34.999
It won't do any good. She'll just
waltz in with some superstar lawyer

235
00:20:35.166 --> 00:20:38.041
who'll get us all canned for
wasting the taxpayer's money.

236
00:20:38.207 --> 00:20:40.498
- That's exactly what she'll do.
- No she won't.

237
00:20:43.416 --> 00:20:44.916
I don't think she'll hide behind anybody.

238
00:20:46.166 --> 00:20:47.541
I don't think she's gonna hide at all.

239
00:20:48.874 --> 00:20:50.957
Then she's as crazy as you are, Curran.

240
00:20:56.082 --> 00:20:59.540
It takes one to know one.

241
00:21:26.082 --> 00:21:29.415
Ms. Tramell, we like you to come downtown
to answer a few questions for us.

242
00:21:30.207 --> 00:21:31.207
Are you arresting me?

243
00:21:32.582 --> 00:21:33.790
If that's the way you want to play it.

244
00:21:35.457 --> 00:21:37.207
Could I change into
something more appropriate?

245
00:21:38.207 --> 00:21:39.748
It'll only take a minute.
Come on in.

246
00:21:44.707 --> 00:21:46.998
Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll be right back.

247
00:22:05.332 --> 00:22:06.373
- Hey, Gus.
- Hmm?

248
00:22:06.874 --> 00:22:08.499
So how long
is this gonna take?

249
00:22:08.999 --> 00:22:09.915
I don't know.

250
00:22:15.374 --> 00:22:17.207
Do you always keep old newspapers around?

251
00:22:17.957 --> 00:22:20.165
Only when they make interesting reading.

252
00:22:36.166 --> 00:22:38.916
- I'm ready.
- You have the right to an attorney.

253
00:22:39.666 --> 00:22:40.957
Why would I need an attorney?

254
00:22:52.082 --> 00:22:53.082
Do you have a cigarette?

255
00:22:53.791 --> 00:22:54.832
I don't smoke.

256
00:22:55.249 --> 00:22:56.249
Yes, you do.

257
00:22:58.957 --> 00:23:01.207
- I quit.
- Congratulations.

258
00:23:13.666 --> 00:23:15.249
Thought you didn't have any cigarettes.

259
00:23:15.666 --> 00:23:17.457
Oh, I found some in my pocket.
Would you like one?

260
00:23:21.624 --> 00:23:23.082
I told you, I quit.

261
00:23:24.166 --> 00:23:25.291
It won't last.

262
00:23:30.999 --> 00:23:32.332
You working on another book?

263
00:23:33.082 --> 00:23:34.040
Yes I am.

264
00:23:35.374 --> 00:23:38.082
It must really be something,
making stuff up all the time.

265
00:23:38.999 --> 00:23:40.332
Yeah, it teaches you to lie.

266
00:23:42.624 --> 00:23:43.707
How's that?

267
00:23:44.791 --> 00:23:46.582
You make stuff up,
it has to be believable.

268
00:23:46.749 --> 00:23:48.624
It's called suspension of disbelief.

269
00:23:49.541 --> 00:23:52.291
I like that.
"Suspension of disbelief."

270
00:23:54.999 --> 00:23:55.957
What's your new book about?

271
00:23:59.791 --> 00:24:02.666
A detective.
He falls for the wrong woman.

272
00:24:09.124 --> 00:24:10.124
What happens?

273
00:24:10.832 --> 00:24:11.748
She kills him.

274
00:24:24.291 --> 00:24:26.791
I'm John Correli, Ms. Tramell.
Assistant district attorney.

275
00:24:26.957 --> 00:24:28.957
I have to inform you
this session's beings taped.

276
00:24:29.124 --> 00:24:30.457
This is Captain Talcott.

277
00:24:30.874 --> 00:24:33.415
- My pleasure.
- And Lieutenant Walker.

278
00:24:33.666 --> 00:24:36.041
- Hi. - Can we get you anything?
A cup of coffee?

279
00:24:36.207 --> 00:24:37.165
No thank you.

280
00:24:37.374 --> 00:24:38.749
Are your attorneys gonna join us?

281
00:24:38.957 --> 00:24:41.082
Ms. Tramell has waived
her rights to an attorney.

282
00:24:45.207 --> 00:24:46.207
Did I miss something?

283
00:24:46.749 --> 00:24:49.082
I told them that you wouldn't
want an attorney present.

284
00:24:49.541 --> 00:24:50.957
- Oh.
- Why have you waived your right

285
00:24:51.124 --> 00:24:52.332
to an attorney, Ms. Tramell?

286
00:24:53.457 --> 00:24:54.957
Why did you think I wouldn't want one?

287
00:24:55.374 --> 00:24:56.915
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.

288
00:24:57.791 --> 00:24:59.041
I have nothing to hide.

289
00:25:13.582 --> 00:25:16.123
There is, uh, no smoking
in this building, Ms. Tramell.

290
00:25:17.957 --> 00:25:20.082
What are you going to do?
Charge me with smoking?

291
00:25:33.874 --> 00:25:36.499
Would you tell us the nature of
your relationship with Mr. Boz?

292
00:25:37.999 --> 00:25:39.874
I had sex with him for about
a year and a half.

293
00:25:41.374 --> 00:25:42.790
I liked having sex with him.

294
00:25:44.499 --> 00:25:46.124
He wasn't afraid of experimenting.

295
00:25:48.541 --> 00:25:49.791
I like men like that.

296
00:25:51.082 --> 00:25:52.248
Men who give me pleasure.

297
00:25:55.291 --> 00:25:56.666
He gave me a lot of pleasure.

298
00:26:01.457 --> 00:26:02.457
You ever, uh...

299
00:26:03.457 --> 00:26:06.832
engage in any sado-masochistic activity?

300
00:26:08.582 --> 00:26:11.207
Exactly what did you have in mind,
Mr. Correli?

301
00:26:14.457 --> 00:26:16.290
- Did you ever tie him up?
- No.

302
00:26:16.499 --> 00:26:17.749
You never tied him up.

303
00:26:18.249 --> 00:26:19.249
No.

304
00:26:19.916 --> 00:26:21.749
Johnny liked to use his hands too much.

305
00:26:22.666 --> 00:26:24.041
I like hands and fingers.

306
00:26:26.916 --> 00:26:30.124
You describe a, uh,
white silk scarf in your book.

307
00:26:30.541 --> 00:26:32.832
I've always had a fondness
for white silk scarves.

308
00:26:33.499 --> 00:26:34.832
They're good for all occasions.

309
00:26:35.707 --> 00:26:37.498
But you said you liked men
to use their hands.

310
00:26:37.707 --> 00:26:38.623
- Didn't you?
- No.

311
00:26:38.791 --> 00:26:41.207
I said I liked Johnny to use his hands

312
00:26:43.874 --> 00:26:47.040
I don't make any rules, Nick.
I go with the flow.

313
00:26:49.457 --> 00:26:51.248
Did you kill Mr.
Boz, Ms. Tramell?

314
00:26:51.916 --> 00:26:54.207
I'd have to be pretty stupid
to write a book about a killing

315
00:26:54.374 --> 00:26:56.915
and then kill somebody the way
I described it in my book.

316
00:26:57.332 --> 00:26:59.165
I'd be announcing myself as the killer.

317
00:26:59.916 --> 00:27:00.791
I'm not stupid.

318
00:27:01.374 --> 00:27:02.999
We know you're not stupid,
Ms. Tramell.

319
00:27:03.166 --> 00:27:04.999
Maybe that's what you're counting
on to get you off the hook.

320
00:27:05.207 --> 00:27:06.873
Writing the book gives you an alibi.

321
00:27:07.082 --> 00:27:08.582
Yes it does, doesn't it?

322
00:27:11.666 --> 00:27:14.749
The answer is no.
I didn't kill him.

323
00:27:17.874 --> 00:27:19.540
Do you use drugs,
Ms. Tramell?

324
00:27:20.041 --> 00:27:22.749
- Sometimes.
- Did you ever do drugs with Mr. Boz?

325
00:27:23.124 --> 00:27:25.249
- Sure.
- What kind of drugs?

326
00:27:25.832 --> 00:27:26.748
Cocaine.

327
00:27:27.707 --> 00:27:29.498
Have you ever fucked on cocaine, Nick?

328
00:27:44.457 --> 00:27:45.415
It's nice.

329
00:27:57.124 --> 00:27:59.165
You like playing games,
don't you?

330
00:27:59.374 --> 00:28:03.665
I have a degree in psychology.
It goes with the turf. Games are fun.

331
00:28:04.541 --> 00:28:07.624
How about boxing? That's a game.
Was that fun too?

332
00:28:07.791 --> 00:28:09.666
I don't think that's
relevant to this inquiry.

333
00:28:11.624 --> 00:28:13.499
Boxing was fun till Manny died.

334
00:28:15.124 --> 00:28:16.374
How did you feel when he died?

335
00:28:16.874 --> 00:28:17.999
I loved him. It hurt.

336
00:28:18.416 --> 00:28:20.416
How did you feel when I told
you Johnny Boz had died?

337
00:28:22.082 --> 00:28:24.373
I felt like someone who read my book,
and was playing a game.

338
00:28:24.541 --> 00:28:25.832
- But it didn't hurt?
- No.

339
00:28:26.041 --> 00:28:27.457
Because you didn't love him...
That's right.

340
00:28:27.624 --> 00:28:28.832
...even though you were fucking him.

341
00:28:29.041 --> 00:28:30.249
You still get the pleasure.

342
00:28:30.999 --> 00:28:33.665
Didn't you ever fuck anybody else
when you were married, Nick?

343
00:28:34.374 --> 00:28:35.374
How did you know he was married?

344
00:28:36.207 --> 00:28:37.748
Maybe I was just guessing.

345
00:28:38.416 --> 00:28:39.582
What difference does it make?

346
00:28:44.541 --> 00:28:45.582
Would you like a cigarette, Nick?

347
00:28:53.707 --> 00:28:55.207
- You two know each other?
- No.

348
00:28:56.124 --> 00:28:57.040
No.

349
00:29:00.499 --> 00:29:01.665
How did you meet Mr. Boz?

350
00:29:02.041 --> 00:29:04.999
I wanted to write a book about the
murder of a retired rock and roll star.

351
00:29:05.582 --> 00:29:08.998
I went down to his club, I picked him up.
Then I had sex with him.

352
00:29:11.416 --> 00:29:14.332
You didn't feel anything for him.
You just had sex with him for your book.

353
00:29:14.707 --> 00:29:17.998
In the beginning.
Then I got to like what he did for me.

354
00:29:20.166 --> 00:29:21.957
That's pretty cold,
ain't it, lady?

355
00:29:22.582 --> 00:29:24.665
I'm a writer, I use people
for what I write.

356
00:29:25.249 --> 00:29:26.374
Let the world beware.

357
00:29:30.499 --> 00:29:32.249
You want me to take a lie detector test?

358
00:29:41.916 --> 00:29:42.624
Wait here, please.

359
00:29:50.666 --> 00:29:53.499
No blips, no blood pressure variations,
no pulse variance.

360
00:29:53.666 --> 00:29:56.499
Either she's telling the truth or
I've never seen anyone like her.

361
00:29:59.457 --> 00:30:00.707
I guess that settles it.

362
00:30:04.374 --> 00:30:06.457
- She's lying.
- Forget it. You can fool me.

363
00:30:06.624 --> 00:30:08.832
- You cannot fool the machine.
- Trust me. It can be done.

364
00:30:09.041 --> 00:30:10.666
And what makes you such an expert?

365
00:30:11.999 --> 00:30:13.332
Cause I know people that have done it.

366
00:30:18.791 --> 00:30:19.666
Thank you.

367
00:30:20.207 --> 00:30:23.082
Yes. Thanks for coming in, Ms.
Tramell. Sorry to inconvenience you.

368
00:30:23.582 --> 00:30:24.873
Could someone give me a ride home?

369
00:30:26.249 --> 00:30:27.165
Sure.

370
00:30:29.332 --> 00:30:30.165
Thank you.

371
00:30:35.582 --> 00:30:36.540
Wanna get a drink?

372
00:30:47.874 --> 00:30:48.749
Rough day?

373
00:30:49.874 --> 00:30:50.707
Not really.

374
00:30:51.291 --> 00:30:53.166
Beating that machine can't be easy.

375
00:30:55.041 --> 00:30:57.541
If I was guilty,
and I wanted to beat that machine,

376
00:30:57.999 --> 00:30:58.915
it wouldn't be hard.

377
00:31:00.707 --> 00:31:01.873
Wouldn't be hard at all.

378
00:31:05.082 --> 00:31:08.582
You took a lie detector test after you
shot those two people, didn't you?

379
00:31:12.082 --> 00:31:13.207
I passed.

380
00:31:14.707 --> 00:31:17.498
You see?
We're both innocent, Nick.

381
00:31:35.957 --> 00:31:37.957
You seem to know an awful lot about me.

382
00:31:39.582 --> 00:31:41.040
You know an awful lot about me.

383
00:31:43.624 --> 00:31:45.790
I don't know anything
that's not police business.

384
00:31:49.332 --> 00:31:50.957
You know I don't wear any underwear.

385
00:31:51.791 --> 00:31:52.791
Don't you, Nick?

386
00:32:01.874 --> 00:32:02.915
Thanks for the ride.

387
00:32:17.916 --> 00:32:19.832
- Get you another glass of wine?
- Yeah.

388
00:32:21.916 --> 00:32:23.041
- Hi, Nick.
- Evening.

389
00:32:26.124 --> 00:32:27.624
So what is all this "Nick" stuff?

390
00:32:27.791 --> 00:32:30.166
Nick, do you wanna cigarette?
Nick, can I have a ride?

391
00:32:30.332 --> 00:32:33.165
She didn't ask me to give her a ride.
She asked anybody.

392
00:32:33.332 --> 00:32:35.623
- And you volunteered.
- Hey, Nick. Evian?

393
00:32:35.791 --> 00:32:39.166
Uh, no Chuck. You get me a double
Black Jack on the rocks, please.

394
00:32:40.957 --> 00:32:41.915
What you doing, hos?

395
00:32:44.291 --> 00:32:45.916
I haven't had a drink in three months.

396
00:32:47.166 --> 00:32:48.249
That all right with you, cowboy?

397
00:32:50.749 --> 00:32:53.207
- She doesn't know me, okay.
- Here you go, Nick.

398
00:32:53.457 --> 00:32:55.873
I never seen her before, uh,
Gus and I talked to her.

399
00:32:56.666 --> 00:32:57.457
Thanks, Chuck.

400
00:32:57.624 --> 00:32:59.540
- You're sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

401
00:33:00.832 --> 00:33:01.790
Cheers.

402
00:33:10.541 --> 00:33:11.374
Now what?

403
00:33:11.874 --> 00:33:15.374
What now what? Now nothing.
She passed the polygraph. That's it.

404
00:33:15.582 --> 00:33:17.498
She knew how to beat it.
That's why she asked to take it.

405
00:33:17.707 --> 00:33:20.707
Now how in the fuck do you know?
What is it with you and this broad anyway?

406
00:33:21.082 --> 00:33:23.082
Oh, come on, Phil.
Do not let this one slide.

407
00:33:23.582 --> 00:33:25.623
What about her parents?
What about what else she published?

408
00:33:25.791 --> 00:33:27.791
Maybe all her books got a
funny way of coming true.

409
00:33:27.999 --> 00:33:31.040
Her parents died in an accident. I don't
give a shit what else she published.

410
00:33:31.207 --> 00:33:32.998
What are you all of a sudden?
A book critic?

411
00:33:33.207 --> 00:33:35.998
How did they die? Huh?
Was there an investigation?

412
00:33:36.416 --> 00:33:39.624
Now you're saying she killed her parents?
Did she kill Manny Vasquez, too?

413
00:33:40.957 --> 00:33:44.957
Not unless she climbed into the ring
and turned into one mean son of a bitch.

414
00:33:46.249 --> 00:33:49.499
Maybe she did, Gus. Maybe she grew herself
an Afro, developed a hell of a left hook,

415
00:33:49.707 --> 00:33:51.082
and put shoe polish all over her face.

416
00:33:51.291 --> 00:33:53.666
- Let's polygraph her again and ask her.
- Fuck you, Phil.

417
00:33:54.082 --> 00:33:55.165
Fuck you, too Nick.

418
00:33:55.832 --> 00:33:57.207
Don't worry, Phil.
Nick will fuck himself.

419
00:33:57.374 --> 00:33:59.249
- Yeah, right.
- You guys are very funny.

420
00:33:59.666 --> 00:34:01.332
Hey, Chucky,
get me another double, will you?

421
00:34:01.499 --> 00:34:03.165
- Coming right up.
- Hey, Shooter...

422
00:34:04.249 --> 00:34:06.957
Are you back on the Black Jack, Shooter?

423
00:34:07.291 --> 00:34:10.749
- We're discussing a case here, Marty.
- I know that. I have no doubts.

424
00:34:10.957 --> 00:34:11.873
Here you go, Nick.

425
00:34:12.582 --> 00:34:13.623
Oh!

426
00:34:14.249 --> 00:34:17.082
A double, huh, Shooter? Hmm?

427
00:34:21.582 --> 00:34:22.832
I'm off-duty, Nilsen.

428
00:34:25.582 --> 00:34:28.957
You hear me?
I'm off-duty discussing a case.

429
00:34:29.124 --> 00:34:30.999
Now, IA shouldn't have
a problem with that.

430
00:34:34.207 --> 00:34:36.165
Maybe I should put in
for some overtime, huh?

431
00:34:38.666 --> 00:34:40.416
Don't work too hard, Shooter.

432
00:34:41.041 --> 00:34:42.332
Might drive you to drink.

433
00:34:45.832 --> 00:34:46.457
Stop riding me, man.

434
00:34:46.666 --> 00:34:48.749
- I'll kick your fucking teeth in.
- Hey!

435
00:34:49.041 --> 00:34:49.999
What's the problem?

436
00:34:50.874 --> 00:34:53.707
No problem, Doctor.
Here comes the shrink...

437
00:34:54.374 --> 00:34:55.249
- Oh, come on.
...huh, just in time

438
00:34:55.416 --> 00:34:56.666
To save her favorite patient.

439
00:34:56.832 --> 00:34:58.248
Just fuck off, Marty.

440
00:35:00.082 --> 00:35:02.415
You kids have a good time tonight, huh?

441
00:35:08.416 --> 00:35:10.874
- He's asking for it.
- That's right. So don't take the bait.

442
00:35:15.416 --> 00:35:16.332
You wanna go?

443
00:35:18.874 --> 00:35:19.832
- Yes.
- Let's go.

444
00:35:23.999 --> 00:35:25.540
Sometimes I think he started banging her

445
00:35:25.707 --> 00:35:27.540
just to get off the hook
with Internal Affairs.

446
00:35:27.707 --> 00:35:30.415
He ain't that way.
He's got a heart.

447
00:37:01.207 --> 00:37:02.832
Nick!

448
00:37:03.707 --> 00:37:05.623
- Stop! No!
- That's right. Come on.

449
00:37:10.166 --> 00:37:11.082
No.

450
00:37:13.749 --> 00:37:15.499
You like it this way.
Keep it down.

451
00:37:26.791 --> 00:37:27.791
Oh.

452
00:37:44.166 --> 00:37:45.207
What was she like?

453
00:37:46.249 --> 00:37:47.749
- Who?
- Catherine Tramell.

454
00:37:51.291 --> 00:37:53.874
You had her pegged.
She used her book as an alibi.

455
00:37:57.124 --> 00:37:58.165
I met her at Berkeley.

456
00:38:01.541 --> 00:38:03.374
We were in some of the same classes.

457
00:38:04.332 --> 00:38:05.332
Why didn't you tell me?

458
00:38:07.124 --> 00:38:08.082
I'm telling you.

459
00:38:18.874 --> 00:38:20.457
You've never been like that before.

460
00:38:21.499 --> 00:38:24.499
- Why?
- You tell me. You're the shrink.

461
00:38:27.582 --> 00:38:29.998
- You weren't making love to me.
- Who was I making love to?

462
00:38:30.416 --> 00:38:31.499
You weren't making love.

463
00:38:37.749 --> 00:38:38.790
I need a cigarette.

464
00:38:40.207 --> 00:38:41.248
I thought you said you quit.

465
00:38:47.166 --> 00:38:48.832
It's the top drawer in the foyer.

466
00:38:50.457 --> 00:38:51.623
Get it on your way out.

467
00:38:55.291 --> 00:38:56.124
Okay.

468
00:39:03.124 --> 00:39:04.540
Scotty.

469
00:39:05.874 --> 00:39:07.040
You look like dogshit.

470
00:39:07.207 --> 00:39:10.540
- Nah, he looks a little shrunk, is all.
- Not just in the head.

471
00:39:11.916 --> 00:39:15.874
All right. I made a couple of calls to
Berkeley. There was a murder in '80.

472
00:39:16.041 --> 00:39:20.541
A professor. In his bed.
Multiple stab wounds. With an icepick.

473
00:39:23.249 --> 00:39:24.415
Tramell was there then,
wasn't she?

474
00:39:26.707 --> 00:39:28.623
University records say she was.

475
00:39:30.416 --> 00:39:32.707
Okay, let's move on this.
Gus, get out to Berkeley.

476
00:39:32.874 --> 00:39:34.790
Harrigan, find out
what else she's published.

477
00:39:34.957 --> 00:39:36.748
Andrews, you get me that file
on her parents' accident.

478
00:39:36.916 --> 00:39:39.666
Copy Beth on everything.
I want psychological input on this.

479
00:39:39.832 --> 00:39:40.582
What about me?

480
00:39:40.749 --> 00:39:42.915
You're already getting
psychological input, hos.

481
00:39:43.082 --> 00:39:45.082
You go soak your head
in a tub of ice water.

482
00:39:48.249 --> 00:39:49.207
Nick...

483
00:39:55.082 --> 00:39:56.498
You see where she leads.

484
00:39:58.999 --> 00:39:59.915
Thank you.

485
00:41:33.457 --> 00:41:34.665
No!

486
00:42:12.707 --> 00:42:13.832
Uh-huh.

487
00:45:51.332 --> 00:45:53.290
Ain't you got nothing better
to do than come in here

488
00:45:53.457 --> 00:45:56.540
- and jack off the damn machine?
- What are you doing here, cowboy?

489
00:45:56.874 --> 00:45:59.499
I came in here to jack
off the damn machine.

490
00:46:00.416 --> 00:46:04.916
One dead psychology professor.
Noah Goldstein. Dr. Noah Goldstein.

491
00:46:06.166 --> 00:46:06.957
And guess what?

492
00:46:08.124 --> 00:46:09.249
He was her counselor.

493
00:46:10.041 --> 00:46:11.041
Was she a suspect?

494
00:46:11.416 --> 00:46:13.666
No, sir. They never even got
a statement from her.

495
00:46:15.582 --> 00:46:17.123
Hazel Dobkins?

496
00:46:18.166 --> 00:46:19.041
You know her?

497
00:46:19.832 --> 00:46:21.873
Couldn't get it
out of my head for years.

498
00:46:22.541 --> 00:46:25.166
Nice little housewife,
three little kids,

499
00:46:25.374 --> 00:46:28.874
nice husband, wasn't porkin' around,
no financial problems.

500
00:46:29.624 --> 00:46:33.707
One day outta the clear blue sky,
she does 'em. All of 'em.

501
00:46:33.916 --> 00:46:34.916
Used a knife

502
00:46:35.082 --> 00:46:36.540
she got for a wedding present.

503
00:46:37.582 --> 00:46:39.873
Didn't even deny it.
Sweet as honey.

504
00:46:40.791 --> 00:46:42.582
Said she didn't know why she done it.

505
00:46:56.666 --> 00:46:58.874
- Hi.
- Am I disturbing you?

506
00:46:59.874 --> 00:47:00.874
No. Come on in

507
00:47:02.957 --> 00:47:03.915
Let's go upstairs.

508
00:47:22.124 --> 00:47:24.124
I'm using you
for my detective in my book.

509
00:47:25.124 --> 00:47:26.165
You don't mind, do you?

510
00:47:30.499 --> 00:47:33.999
I was just gonna make
myself a drink. Do you want one?

511
00:47:34.374 --> 00:47:35.249
No, thanks.

512
00:47:35.541 --> 00:47:38.541
Oh, that's right. You're off the
Jack Daniels too, aren't you?

513
00:47:42.916 --> 00:47:44.999
Got a, uh,
few more questions to ask you.

514
00:47:45.166 --> 00:47:46.374
I have some for you too.

515
00:47:47.041 --> 00:47:47.957
For my book.

516
00:47:58.291 --> 00:48:00.416
You have something against ice cubes?

517
00:48:01.707 --> 00:48:02.790
I like rough edges.

518
00:48:03.832 --> 00:48:04.957
So what do you wanna ask me?

519
00:48:07.124 --> 00:48:08.374
How does it feel to kill someone?

520
00:48:11.916 --> 00:48:12.874
You tell me.

521
00:48:14.999 --> 00:48:16.249
I don't know. But you do.

522
00:48:19.207 --> 00:48:20.873
It was an accident. They...

523
00:48:21.082 --> 00:48:22.248
They got in the line of fire.

524
00:48:26.374 --> 00:48:29.540
Four shootings in five years.
All accidents?

525
00:48:31.916 --> 00:48:34.332
They were drug buys.
I was working undercover.

526
00:48:36.749 --> 00:48:38.624
You wanna tell me about
Professor Goldstein.

527
00:48:43.041 --> 00:48:44.749
Well, there's a name from the past.

528
00:48:44.916 --> 00:48:47.666
You want a name from the present?
What about Hazel Dobkins?

529
00:48:50.166 --> 00:48:52.707
Noah Goldstein was my
counselor in my freshman year.

530
00:48:54.124 --> 00:48:56.832
That's probably where I got the
idea for the icepick. For my book.

531
00:48:59.332 --> 00:49:01.332
Funny how the subconscious works.

532
00:49:01.999 --> 00:49:03.165
Hilarious.

533
00:49:05.457 --> 00:49:06.498
Hazel is my friend.

534
00:49:06.666 --> 00:49:09.166
Well, your friend
took out her whole family.

535
00:49:09.582 --> 00:49:12.373
Yes. She's helped me
understand homicidal impulse.

536
00:49:12.541 --> 00:49:14.582
Thought you would learn that at school.

537
00:49:16.249 --> 00:49:20.457
Only in theory. But you know
all about homicidal impulse...

538
00:49:21.541 --> 00:49:22.541
don't you, Shooter?

539
00:49:25.999 --> 00:49:27.707
Not in theory, in practice.

540
00:49:28.749 --> 00:49:31.457
What happened?
Did you get sucked into it?

541
00:49:32.666 --> 00:49:34.082
Did you like it too much?

542
00:49:37.124 --> 00:49:38.707
I don't know what you're talking about.

543
00:49:41.749 --> 00:49:43.374
Tell me about the coke, Nick.

544
00:49:46.332 --> 00:49:48.248
The day you shot those two tourists...

545
00:49:49.457 --> 00:49:50.873
how much coke did you do?

546
00:49:54.874 --> 00:49:57.832
Come on. You can tell me.

547
00:50:04.374 --> 00:50:07.040
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

548
00:50:08.207 --> 00:50:10.082
They never tested you,
did they?

549
00:50:12.166 --> 00:50:13.499
Internal Affairs knew.

550
00:50:16.624 --> 00:50:18.874
Your wife knew too,
didn't she?

551
00:50:24.957 --> 00:50:26.707
She knew what was going on.

552
00:50:30.291 --> 00:50:32.124
Nicky got too close to the flame.

553
00:50:40.082 --> 00:50:41.290
Nicky liked it.

554
00:50:46.707 --> 00:50:48.457
That's why she killed herself.

555
00:51:04.707 --> 00:51:05.623
Hiya, hon.

556
00:51:10.791 --> 00:51:12.207
You two have met,
haven't you?

557
00:51:21.707 --> 00:51:25.457
You're gonna make
a terrific character, Nick.

558
00:51:35.291 --> 00:51:37.166
She's on the phone.
She'll be right with you, detective--

559
00:51:38.124 --> 00:51:40.332
Oh. I'm gonna
have to give you a call back.

560
00:51:40.624 --> 00:51:42.999
- Detective. Detective, you can't go in--
- Let me call you back.

561
00:51:44.124 --> 00:51:45.290
Who's got access to my file?

562
00:51:45.457 --> 00:51:48.415
- What are you talking about, Nick?
- Who has access to my goddamn file?

563
00:51:48.624 --> 00:51:52.040
Nobody. It's a confidential psychiatric
record, it would be illegal.

564
00:51:52.207 --> 00:51:54.915
Don't do it.
Don't you fucking lie to me.

565
00:51:55.624 --> 00:51:56.999
- It's Internal Affairs. Was it?
- No.

566
00:51:57.416 --> 00:51:58.791
- No, Nick. Please.
- Who.

567
00:51:59.582 --> 00:52:00.832
It's, uh.. Nilsen.

568
00:52:13.082 --> 00:52:14.123
What do you want, Curran?

569
00:52:14.291 --> 00:52:16.124
You sold her my file,
didn't you?

570
00:52:16.999 --> 00:52:18.332
What are you talking about?

571
00:52:18.957 --> 00:52:20.332
Catherine Tramell.

572
00:52:20.707 --> 00:52:21.832
How much did she pay you?

573
00:52:22.291 --> 00:52:23.541
- Hey. Come on!

574
00:52:23.707 --> 00:52:24.748
- Let him go!
- Stop it!

575
00:52:26.041 --> 00:52:26.832
How much?

576
00:52:27.041 --> 00:52:27.832
Come on.

577
00:52:29.124 --> 00:52:32.082
Hey, back off.
Just back off, Curran.

578
00:52:32.916 --> 00:52:34.916
Nice and easy now.
Nice and easy.

579
00:52:36.166 --> 00:52:37.957
You fucked yourself, Shooter.
You hear me?

580
00:52:38.124 --> 00:52:38.915
- You are out!
- Take it easy.

581
00:52:39.332 --> 00:52:41.707
- Cool it. Take it easy.
- You are out! You're out.

582
00:52:41.916 --> 00:52:44.166
- Okay, okay.
- Save it. Save it.

583
00:52:46.832 --> 00:52:47.748
Nick!

584
00:52:48.332 --> 00:52:50.623
- What's going down, hos?
- Nothing, all right. I'll be okay.

585
00:52:50.791 --> 00:52:52.332
No, sir. You won't.
They're gonna want your badge.

586
00:52:52.499 --> 00:52:53.832
I'm tired of being played with.

587
00:52:54.041 --> 00:52:56.457
You got a real conclusive
way of demonstrating that.

588
00:53:02.749 --> 00:53:05.624
She knows where I live and breathe.

589
00:53:07.916 --> 00:53:09.582
She's coming after me, Gus.

590
00:53:11.082 --> 00:53:12.498
What is it you got between you?

591
00:53:15.999 --> 00:53:16.874
I don't know.

592
00:53:17.416 --> 00:53:18.416
It's something though.

593
00:53:20.291 --> 00:53:21.291
Something.

594
00:53:22.374 --> 00:53:23.165
Yeah.

595
00:53:32.582 --> 00:53:36.415
George Jefferson is unfair.
He's short with no hair.

596
00:53:39.874 --> 00:53:40.832
Nick?

597
00:53:42.791 --> 00:53:43.832
Nick, are you there?

598
00:53:44.249 --> 00:53:46.624
Go away, Beth.
I don't wanna see you.

599
00:53:54.041 --> 00:53:55.249
I still have my key.

600
00:53:58.207 --> 00:53:59.832
Put 'em on the table and leave.

601
00:54:03.707 --> 00:54:05.332
Put 'em on the goddamn table
and leave?

602
00:54:05.541 --> 00:54:08.416
Damnit. Don't shut me out.
You owe me more than that.

603
00:54:11.041 --> 00:54:12.749
I don't owe you anything.

604
00:54:14.249 --> 00:54:15.999
You don't owe me anything.

605
00:54:17.124 --> 00:54:19.582
We went to bed, what, ten,
15 times?

606
00:54:19.791 --> 00:54:22.541
Maybe it wasn't memorable enough
to, to carry an obligation.

607
00:54:25.332 --> 00:54:29.165
- Sometimes I really hate you.
- Oh! Why don't you get yourself

608
00:54:29.332 --> 00:54:32.915
some friendly little therapist and
work out some of that hostility?

609
00:54:33.374 --> 00:54:34.957
And maybe you can get off once in a while.

610
00:54:39.874 --> 00:54:40.874
Are you nuts?

611
00:54:51.916 --> 00:54:53.249
I'm sorry...

612
00:54:55.249 --> 00:54:56.457
I don't usually act like that.

613
00:54:58.207 --> 00:54:59.748
How could you give him my file?

614
00:55:00.582 --> 00:55:01.582
I had to.

615
00:55:03.041 --> 00:55:05.332
He was going to recommend
your discharge from the force.

616
00:55:06.374 --> 00:55:08.999
He didn't buy my evaluation.
He said I wasn't objective.

617
00:55:09.457 --> 00:55:12.248
So I made a deal with him to
review the session notes himself.

618
00:55:13.499 --> 00:55:14.957
I didn't think he'd show them to anybody.

619
00:55:16.041 --> 00:55:16.999
You did it for me?

620
00:55:17.791 --> 00:55:20.499
Yes. I care about you.
I did it for you.

621
00:55:26.457 --> 00:55:29.707
Go away, Beth.
Please, just go away.

622
00:55:58.332 --> 00:55:59.248
Yo.

623
00:56:04.541 --> 00:56:05.499
I'm on my way.

624
00:56:57.874 --> 00:57:01.790
One shot. Close range.
Probably a .38 caliber revolver.

625
00:57:03.582 --> 00:57:04.540
Give me your gun, Nick.

626
00:57:14.999 --> 00:57:15.957
You think that--

627
00:57:21.499 --> 00:57:24.874
I don't, hos,
but I got the minority opinion.

628
00:57:29.832 --> 00:57:30.790
Okay. I went after him.

629
00:57:32.749 --> 00:57:33.624
I lost my temper.

630
00:57:34.374 --> 00:57:37.249
You have any evidence that he showed
your psychiatric file to anyone?

631
00:57:39.082 --> 00:57:40.040
No.

632
00:57:44.332 --> 00:57:45.832
We'll speak with you afterwards,
Dr. Garner.

633
00:57:45.999 --> 00:57:47.415
I'd like to sit in.
If you don't mind.

634
00:57:47.582 --> 00:57:48.957
- I'd really rather wait until after--
- I don't see anything wrong

635
00:57:49.124 --> 00:57:52.457
with Dr. Garner sitting in if
Detective Curran doesn't object.

636
00:57:58.166 --> 00:57:59.291
Where were you last night?

637
00:57:59.791 --> 00:58:00.874
Home. Watching TV.

638
00:58:01.332 --> 00:58:02.290
All night?

639
00:58:03.874 --> 00:58:04.832
Yes. All night.

640
00:58:05.999 --> 00:58:06.874
Were you drinking?

641
00:58:11.624 --> 00:58:12.624
Yeah, I was drinking.

642
00:58:12.999 --> 00:58:14.249
When did you start drinking again?

643
00:58:14.666 --> 00:58:15.666
Couple of days ago.

644
00:58:15.916 --> 00:58:19.416
I saw Detective Curran at his apartment
about ten o'clock last night.

645
00:58:19.582 --> 00:58:20.832
He was sober and lucid.

646
00:58:21.416 --> 00:58:23.999
I asked him in my capacity
as his departmental therapist

647
00:58:24.166 --> 00:58:26.207
about his altercation with Lt.
Nilsen.

648
00:58:26.791 --> 00:58:29.082
He expressed regret
and displayed no hostility.

649
00:58:30.874 --> 00:58:32.124
How long were you at his apartment?

650
00:58:32.291 --> 00:58:33.457
About 15 minutes.

651
00:58:34.082 --> 00:58:36.373
I saw there was no reason
for my concern and left.

652
00:58:37.832 --> 00:58:39.665
There's no smoking in
this building, detective.

653
00:58:41.957 --> 00:58:43.665
What are you gonna do?
Charge me with smoking?

654
00:58:45.666 --> 00:58:46.624
Oh, for Christ--

655
00:58:46.832 --> 00:58:50.248
All right, Nick, I'm gonna ask you
- for the record,

656
00:58:50.541 --> 00:58:51.999
did you kill Marty Nilsen?

657
00:58:54.499 --> 00:58:55.499
No.

658
00:58:57.291 --> 00:58:59.499
Come on. I'm gonna storm into
his office in front of everybody

659
00:58:59.666 --> 00:59:01.166
in the middle of the day
and kill him that night?

660
00:59:02.124 --> 00:59:03.249
I'm not that dumb.

661
00:59:03.666 --> 00:59:05.832
Going after him before gets you
off the hook for killing him.

662
00:59:05.999 --> 00:59:06.957
That's your alibi.

663
00:59:07.707 --> 00:59:10.790
Like writing a book about killing a guy
gets you off the hook for killing him.

664
00:59:10.999 --> 00:59:11.874
Good point.

665
00:59:12.249 --> 00:59:13.832
I don't understand.
What are you talking about? What book?

666
00:59:14.207 --> 00:59:15.498
Private joke, asshole.

667
00:59:15.666 --> 00:59:16.791
I don't think it's funny.

668
00:59:17.832 --> 00:59:19.415
You're going on leave, Curran...

669
00:59:20.124 --> 00:59:22.582
pending the outcome
of a psychiatric evaluation.

670
00:59:34.582 --> 00:59:36.665
Beth!
I'll get my stuff in a minute.

671
00:59:39.874 --> 00:59:40.749
Beth!

672
00:59:42.791 --> 00:59:43.582
Thank you.

673
00:59:48.166 --> 00:59:49.374
It's the least I could do.

674
00:59:50.332 --> 00:59:53.040
Considering, I got you into
this mess with those reports.

675
00:59:53.207 --> 00:59:54.915
No. I mean it, thank you.

676
00:59:57.999 --> 01:00:00.374
How do you know Catherine
Tramell saw your file?

677
01:00:00.832 --> 01:00:03.165
She know things about me
that I only told you.

678
01:00:04.749 --> 01:00:06.082
She must really be something...

679
01:00:07.291 --> 01:00:08.666
from a clinical point of view.

680
01:00:09.874 --> 01:00:11.082
What was she like in school?

681
01:00:11.332 --> 01:00:13.998
I hardly knew her.
She gave me the creeps, though.

682
01:00:14.707 --> 01:00:15.665
I don't know why.

683
01:00:20.457 --> 01:00:23.040
Get some rest. Promise?

684
01:00:29.207 --> 01:00:30.540
Beth. I didn't mean what I said
yesterday--

685
01:00:30.707 --> 01:00:31.748
Yes you did.

686
01:00:33.291 --> 01:00:35.082
I'm a big girl.
I can handle it.

687
01:00:59.249 --> 01:01:01.624
- Hey, you take care of yourself.
- What did you find out about the parents?

688
01:01:02.707 --> 01:01:03.748
You're on leave, man.

689
01:01:05.582 --> 01:01:08.457
You're on psycho leave. I mean,
I'm talking to a possible whacko here.

690
01:01:08.916 --> 01:01:11.291
Well, you know I'm whacko, Sam.
What did you find out?

691
01:01:15.416 --> 01:01:16.374
The boat blew.

692
01:01:17.582 --> 01:01:20.832
There was a leak in the fuel line.
There have been two previous repairs.

693
01:01:20.999 --> 01:01:22.665
They had a five mil policy on both of 'em.

694
01:01:22.874 --> 01:01:24.915
A real heavy investigation,
but they got zilch.

695
01:01:25.374 --> 01:01:27.915
Big goose-egg.
It was an accident.

696
01:01:28.082 --> 01:01:29.790
IA's gonna talk to you
more about Nilsen.

697
01:01:29.957 --> 01:01:31.623
They're handling the investigation,
we're not.

698
01:01:31.791 --> 01:01:34.166
You stay in touch with Dr. Garner,
it'll help on the evaluation.

699
01:01:34.749 --> 01:01:35.832
She killed him, Phil.

700
01:01:38.041 --> 01:01:40.291
- Beth? Now you've got Beth killing
people? - No, Catherine Tramell.

701
01:01:40.457 --> 01:01:41.373
It's part of her game.

702
01:01:42.416 --> 01:01:45.041
First you've got her stealing your file.
Now you've got her killing Nilsen.

703
01:01:45.832 --> 01:01:48.457
Forget about her for Christ sake?
Go somewhere. Sit in the sun.

704
01:01:48.666 --> 01:01:51.249
- Ger her the hell out of your system.
- You don't buy it, do you?

705
01:01:52.374 --> 01:01:53.874
She knew nobody would buy it.

706
01:01:54.624 --> 01:01:57.457
She knew I'd say she did it.
And she knew that nobody would buy it.

707
01:01:57.957 --> 01:02:00.207
She is screwing with your head, Nick.

708
01:02:00.416 --> 01:02:01.207
Stay away from her.

709
01:02:28.957 --> 01:02:30.207
I heard about what happened.

710
01:02:38.957 --> 01:02:40.540
What good's a shooter without his gun?

711
01:02:41.999 --> 01:02:43.499
How exactly did you find out?

712
01:02:43.957 --> 01:02:47.457
I have attorneys.
They have friends. I have friends.

713
01:02:48.374 --> 01:02:50.290
Money buys a lot of attorneys and friends.

714
01:02:50.874 --> 01:02:52.874
Well, I wouldn't know about that.
I don't have any money.

715
01:02:53.207 --> 01:02:56.332
I don't have any attorneys,
and Gus is my only real friend.

716
01:02:56.957 --> 01:02:58.582
I wasn't talking about real friends.

717
01:03:03.666 --> 01:03:04.999
Why doesn't Gus like me?

718
01:03:06.832 --> 01:03:07.790
I like you.

719
01:03:09.416 --> 01:03:10.874
- You do?
- Yes.

720
01:03:12.957 --> 01:03:14.540
You wanna go upstairs and have a drink?

721
01:03:17.249 --> 01:03:18.707
I didn't think you'd ask me.

722
01:03:20.416 --> 01:03:22.374
Then I guess you don't know
your character that well.

723
01:03:22.957 --> 01:03:25.915
Maybe, but we're learning.

724
01:03:26.832 --> 01:03:28.873
Pretty soon I'll know you
better than you know yourself.

725
01:03:29.582 --> 01:03:31.582
- Don't be too sure.
- Why not?

726
01:03:32.332 --> 01:03:33.998
- I'm very unpredictable.
- Unpredictable?

727
01:03:44.457 --> 01:03:46.248
You ought to put some warmth
into the place.

728
01:03:46.999 --> 01:03:49.040
You don't want it to reflect
on your personality.

729
01:03:49.499 --> 01:03:50.749
I'm not trying to fool anybody.

730
01:03:51.832 --> 01:03:53.707
Jack Daniel's all right?
It's gonna have to be.

731
01:03:54.166 --> 01:03:55.249
- Ice?
- Yeah, great.

732
01:04:04.832 --> 01:04:05.623
I was expecting you.

733
01:04:10.749 --> 01:04:12.957
K-mart. A buck sixty-five.

734
01:04:18.624 --> 01:04:19.999
Why don't you let me do this for you?

735
01:04:28.707 --> 01:04:30.290
You like watching me do it,
don't you?

736
01:04:34.207 --> 01:04:38.665
Could I have a cigarette too, please?
See, I told you you'd start smoking again.

737
01:04:39.166 --> 01:04:40.124
Would you light it for me?

738
01:04:47.082 --> 01:04:47.915
Thanks.

739
01:04:50.916 --> 01:04:52.832
So how much did you
pay Nilsen for my file?

740
01:04:55.499 --> 01:04:57.499
Isn't he the policeman
that you shot, Shooter?

741
01:05:00.249 --> 01:05:01.999
What if I asked you
not to call me Shooter?

742
01:05:02.374 --> 01:05:04.999
Okay.
How about if I call you Nicky?

743
01:05:07.332 --> 01:05:08.790
My wife used to call me Nicky.

744
01:05:10.332 --> 01:05:12.915
Yeah, I know. I like it.

745
01:05:18.291 --> 01:05:20.832
Cheers.
My friends call me Catherine.

746
01:05:21.749 --> 01:05:23.332
What Manny Vasquez used to call you?

747
01:05:24.082 --> 01:05:25.082
Bitch, mostly,

748
01:05:26.166 --> 01:05:27.624
but he meant it affectionately.

749
01:05:29.707 --> 01:05:30.665
Do you have any coke?

750
01:05:33.291 --> 01:05:34.582
I just love coke with Jack Daniels.

751
01:05:35.582 --> 01:05:36.665
Got a Pepsi in the fridge.

752
01:05:37.874 --> 01:05:39.874
Well, it's not really the same thing,
now is it?

753
01:05:41.624 --> 01:05:42.540
No, it's not.

754
01:05:45.791 --> 01:05:46.874
So where is this going?

755
01:05:47.832 --> 01:05:48.748
Hmm?

756
01:05:50.874 --> 01:05:51.832
What do you want from me?

757
01:05:55.874 --> 01:05:58.124
Say, "What do you want
from me, Catherine?"

758
01:06:01.249 --> 01:06:03.249
What the fuck do you
want from me, Catherine?

759
01:06:11.332 --> 01:06:12.457
I brought you something.

760
01:06:19.582 --> 01:06:21.415
Aren't you gonna say thank you?

761
01:06:22.832 --> 01:06:23.790
What's it about?

762
01:06:24.207 --> 01:06:25.957
It's about a boy who kills his parents.

763
01:06:26.124 --> 01:06:28.207
They have a plane.
He makes it look like an accident.

764
01:06:32.541 --> 01:06:33.332
Why'd he do that?

765
01:06:35.291 --> 01:06:36.957
To see if he could get away with it.

766
01:06:40.916 --> 01:06:41.957
When'd you write this?

767
01:06:43.416 --> 01:06:45.166
You mean, did I write it
before my parents died?

768
01:06:45.332 --> 01:06:46.290
Yeah.

769
01:06:51.082 --> 01:06:51.873
No.

770
01:06:52.832 --> 01:06:53.998
I wrote it years afterwards.

771
01:06:55.916 --> 01:06:57.666
You're not gonna stop following
me around now, are you?

772
01:06:57.832 --> 01:06:58.915
Just because you're on leave.

773
01:06:59.707 --> 01:07:00.873
Absolutely not.

774
01:07:02.916 --> 01:07:04.041
Good. I'd miss you.

775
01:07:04.832 --> 01:07:06.998
You could get in trouble, though.
You're not really a cop anymore.

776
01:07:07.166 --> 01:07:08.124
I'll risk it.

777
01:07:09.166 --> 01:07:11.457
- Why take the risk?
- To see if I can get away with it.

778
01:07:16.041 --> 01:07:17.082
How's your new book?

779
01:07:17.249 --> 01:07:18.915
It's practically
writing itself.

780
01:07:20.124 --> 01:07:23.374
Oh, I'll be leaving about midnight.
In case you are gonna follow me.

781
01:07:25.707 --> 01:07:27.332
I'll be at Johnny Boz's club.

782
01:07:27.582 --> 01:07:28.623
I'll meet you there.

783
01:07:31.332 --> 01:07:32.207
Hi, Gus.

784
01:07:49.374 --> 01:07:52.415
Forgive me for asking, hos,
and I don't mean to belabor the obvious,

785
01:07:52.916 --> 01:07:56.082
but why is it you've got your
head so far up your own ass?

786
01:07:56.749 --> 01:07:59.790
She wanna play.
Fine, I can play.

787
01:08:01.666 --> 01:08:03.374
Everybody she plays with dies.

788
01:08:04.957 --> 01:08:05.998
I know what that's like.

789
01:09:02.166 --> 01:09:03.582
- Hi.
- Hi, babe.

790
01:09:05.707 --> 01:09:06.707
Looks good.

791
01:14:29.916 --> 01:14:34.416
Hey. Shh.

792
01:14:35.124 --> 01:14:36.249
Shh.

793
01:16:35.874 --> 01:16:37.749
If you don't leave her alone,
I'll kill you.

794
01:16:44.916 --> 01:16:46.707
Let me ask you something, Rocky.

795
01:16:48.916 --> 01:16:49.832
Man to man.

796
01:16:52.999 --> 01:16:54.749
I think she's the fuck of the century.

797
01:16:59.707 --> 01:17:00.665
What do you think?

798
01:17:05.707 --> 01:17:06.748
How long you been here?

799
01:17:08.957 --> 01:17:10.165
You like watching,

800
01:17:10.374 --> 01:17:11.249
don't you?

801
01:17:15.499 --> 01:17:16.999
She likes me to watch.

802
01:17:42.041 --> 01:17:43.291
Nicky...

803
01:18:01.916 --> 01:18:02.791
Fuck.

804
01:18:08.624 --> 01:18:10.040
The beach, C

805
01:18:33.124 --> 01:18:34.082
Hi.

806
01:18:53.874 --> 01:18:54.790
Good morning.

807
01:18:56.957 --> 01:18:59.665
Guess, uh, Roxy's not taking this
too well, huh?

808
01:19:00.124 --> 01:19:02.040
She's seen me fuck plenty of guys.

809
01:19:03.457 --> 01:19:06.040
Maybe she saw something
she's never seen before.

810
01:19:08.332 --> 01:19:09.790
She's seen everything before.

811
01:19:10.041 --> 01:19:12.416
Honey, I thought
I'd seen everything before.

812
01:19:13.332 --> 01:19:15.498
Did you really think it was so special?

813
01:19:16.624 --> 01:19:18.832
I told her I thought it was
the fuck of the century.

814
01:19:24.957 --> 01:19:25.957
Well, what do you think?

815
01:19:27.207 --> 01:19:28.748
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.

816
01:19:34.541 --> 01:19:35.707
What about Roxy?

817
01:19:36.249 --> 01:19:37.290
Is she more fun?

818
01:19:37.457 --> 01:19:40.123
Do you like her
to join us sometime?

819
01:19:41.291 --> 01:19:42.916
Did she join you and Johnny?

820
01:19:43.374 --> 01:19:45.332
No, Johnny felt intimidated.

821
01:19:46.082 --> 01:19:47.165
Look what happened to him.

822
01:19:48.624 --> 01:19:50.749
Tell me, Nicky,
were you frightened last night?

823
01:19:51.207 --> 01:19:54.082
That's the point, wasn't it?
That's what made it so good.

824
01:19:56.249 --> 01:19:59.249
- You shouldn't play this game.
- Why not? I like it.

825
01:20:00.457 --> 01:20:01.415
You're in over your head.

826
01:20:01.832 --> 01:20:04.957
Maybe.
But this is how I'll catch my killer.

827
01:20:09.749 --> 01:20:13.540
I'm not gonna confess all my secrets,
Nick, just because I have an orgasm.

828
01:20:15.499 --> 01:20:17.582
You won't learn anything
I don't want you to know.

829
01:20:17.957 --> 01:20:19.123
Yes, I will.

830
01:20:20.249 --> 01:20:21.207
And I'll nail you.

831
01:20:22.499 --> 01:20:24.082
You'll just fall in love with me.

832
01:20:25.832 --> 01:20:27.248
I'm in love with you already.

833
01:20:31.624 --> 01:20:32.749
But I'll nail you anyway.

834
01:20:35.124 --> 01:20:36.499
You can put that in your book.

835
01:20:59.666 --> 01:21:00.791
Thought I'd find you here.

836
01:21:01.624 --> 01:21:04.499
Where the fuck you been?
I've been over to your place.

837
01:21:04.666 --> 01:21:08.582
Easy, cowboy, easy.
I wasn't there.

838
01:21:09.249 --> 01:21:11.124
I went over last night, too.

839
01:21:12.582 --> 01:21:13.957
Well, I wasn't there either.

840
01:21:20.666 --> 01:21:21.749
You fucked her.

841
01:21:23.374 --> 01:21:27.582
Goddamn dumb son of a bitch.
You fucked her.

842
01:21:28.582 --> 01:21:32.748
Goddamn, you are one dumb
son of a bitch.

843
01:21:32.916 --> 01:21:34.207
Next time I'll use a rubber.

844
01:21:34.374 --> 01:21:37.582
I don't give a flying
chili-bean fart about a rubber.

845
01:21:37.749 --> 01:21:38.874
Gus, Gus, Gus,
you're forgetting something.

846
01:21:39.041 --> 01:21:40.666
- I got it, Harry. How much?
- Thirty-three.

847
01:21:40.832 --> 01:21:41.832
Got it.

848
01:21:42.582 --> 01:21:44.623
I'm worried about him.
He's worried about rubbers.

849
01:21:44.791 --> 01:21:46.541
You gotta protect yourself, Gus.
You really do.

850
01:21:46.707 --> 01:21:48.040
What in the hell for?

851
01:21:49.291 --> 01:21:50.582
You think I'm getting any?

852
01:21:50.916 --> 01:21:54.499
I mean, sure, I can get laid
by goddamn blue-haired women.

853
01:21:54.791 --> 01:21:55.749
I don't like 'em.

854
01:21:56.249 --> 01:21:58.040
Don't knock it
till you've tried it.

855
01:22:04.541 --> 01:22:05.582
Feeling better?

856
01:22:05.791 --> 01:22:06.916
I feel fine.

857
01:22:08.707 --> 01:22:09.873
How could you fuck her?

858
01:22:11.582 --> 01:22:12.457
Gus, come on.

859
01:22:16.874 --> 01:22:18.165
You wanna die, hos?

860
01:22:19.207 --> 01:22:20.957
What is it?
Those goddamn tourists?

861
01:22:22.499 --> 01:22:26.165
You still feel so bad about that you're
wigglin' your way into an icepick?

862
01:22:27.707 --> 01:22:30.165
Got too many goddamn
tourists coming here anyway.

863
01:22:30.541 --> 01:22:33.916
Plenty more goddamn tourists
where they goddamn came from.

864
01:22:44.041 --> 01:22:45.291
I'm not afraid of her.

865
01:22:45.666 --> 01:22:46.832
Why the hell not?

866
01:22:49.749 --> 01:22:52.665
I don't know. I'm just not.

867
01:22:53.082 --> 01:22:54.082
That's her pussy talking,

868
01:22:54.291 --> 01:22:55.374
it ain't your brain.

869
01:22:55.582 --> 01:22:57.915
Gus, come on. Gus...

870
01:23:00.082 --> 01:23:00.998
Disgusting.

871
01:23:06.749 --> 01:23:10.499
IA done did a track on It.
Martin D for Dickhead Nilsen.

872
01:23:11.207 --> 01:23:12.832
They found a safety deposit box

873
01:23:13.041 --> 01:23:15.749
with 50,000 dollars in I,
taken out three months ago,

874
01:23:15.916 --> 01:23:17.041
and not used since.

875
01:23:19.291 --> 01:23:21.624
It doesn't make sense.
She didn't know me three months ago.

876
01:23:22.707 --> 01:23:24.207
Maybe it wasn't her that paid him.

877
01:23:24.416 --> 01:23:26.999
Maybe the money was for something else.
How the fuck do I know?

878
01:23:30.874 --> 01:23:33.999
I'm just an old city cowboy trying
not to fall outta his saddle.

879
01:23:48.999 --> 01:23:50.540
- You all right, cowboy?
- Yeah.

880
01:23:50.791 --> 01:23:51.624
Yeah?

881
01:23:52.249 --> 01:23:53.415
Come on,
I'll drive you home.

882
01:23:54.166 --> 01:23:57.124
In that little pissant car of yours?
Hell, no.

883
01:23:57.624 --> 01:24:00.290
I ain't getting no back
pain disability retirement.

884
01:24:00.666 --> 01:24:05.166
I am gonna get me a full pension
and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.

885
01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:07.998
- Right. Move over. I'm driving you--
- You think I'd let you drive

886
01:24:08.166 --> 01:24:09.416
my Cadillac car?

887
01:24:09.666 --> 01:24:14.041
I ain't gonna let no head-up-his-ass
person drive my Cadillac car.

888
01:24:15.082 --> 01:24:16.415
Grow up!

889
01:26:15.832 --> 01:26:17.540
You wanna play, huh?
Come on!

890
01:26:20.374 --> 01:26:21.540
Come on!

891
01:26:29.332 --> 01:26:29.873
Come on.

892
01:27:05.957 --> 01:27:06.873
Roxy...

893
01:27:21.041 --> 01:27:22.999
- All right. Ready?
- Okay.

894
01:27:28.249 --> 01:27:30.415
Lieutenant!
I got the information.

895
01:27:30.582 --> 01:27:32.040
Well, get it down here.

896
01:27:32.541 --> 01:27:35.041
This is your statement? You signed
your name to this crock of shit?

897
01:27:35.207 --> 01:27:36.498
Why not? It was an accident.

898
01:27:36.666 --> 01:27:38.957
You're driving around North Beach,
for no particular reason,

899
01:27:39.124 --> 01:27:40.540
and this car won't get out of the way.

900
01:27:40.707 --> 01:27:42.248
I don't think she meant
to go off the edge, do you?

901
01:27:42.416 --> 01:27:44.374
- Could we have him for a minute here?
- No, you cannot.

902
01:27:45.291 --> 01:27:46.374
Don't fuck with me on this, Nick.

903
01:27:46.541 --> 01:27:48.499
I don't need a reason
to put your ass in a sling.

904
01:27:49.332 --> 01:27:50.748
Full name is Roxanne Hardy.

905
01:27:50.916 --> 01:27:52.624
Last known address,
Cloverdale, California.

906
01:27:52.791 --> 01:27:56.582
No priors, no convictions. The car
is registered to Catherine Tramell.

907
01:27:58.124 --> 01:28:00.124
- You knew her, didn't you?
- Gus and I met her at Tramell's house.

908
01:28:00.291 --> 01:28:01.499
All we did was write her name down.

909
01:28:01.666 --> 01:28:05.749
You wrote her name down, and then,
big surprise, she rolls her car

910
01:28:05.916 --> 01:28:08.707
down the hill in front of you and dies.
Is that what you're telling me?

911
01:28:08.874 --> 01:28:10.040
That's all I know.

912
01:28:11.457 --> 01:28:13.790
Well, you know what then?
Fuck you, Nick.

913
01:28:15.124 --> 01:28:16.207
Fuck you!

914
01:28:16.499 --> 01:28:17.707
I want you in Dr.
Garner's office at nine--

915
01:28:17.874 --> 01:28:19.624
I told you to stay away from Tramell.

916
01:28:19.791 --> 01:28:21.166
You didn't tell me
to stay away from the car!

917
01:28:21.332 --> 01:28:22.873
I said I want you at Dr.
Garner's office at nine o'clock.

918
01:28:23.041 --> 01:28:24.957
Who are you guys gonna sell
my file to now, huh?

919
01:28:27.457 --> 01:28:30.123
You are out of control, Curran.
You hear me?

920
01:28:37.249 --> 01:28:38.207
You see--

921
01:28:39.916 --> 01:28:43.874
Hello, Nick. This is Dr.
Myron and Dr. McElwaine.

922
01:28:44.291 --> 01:28:45.291
Nick.

923
01:28:46.207 --> 01:28:49.582
They've been asked to consult with
me on this psychiatric evaluation.

924
01:28:51.166 --> 01:28:52.041
Sit down, Nick.

925
01:29:00.207 --> 01:29:01.957
Nick, we understand you've
been having some difficulty

926
01:29:02.124 --> 01:29:03.457
controlling your temper lately.

927
01:29:04.166 --> 01:29:05.874
Only in regard to one person.

928
01:29:07.416 --> 01:29:10.499
Do you think Lieutenant
Nilsen deserved to die?

929
01:29:12.457 --> 01:29:15.207
I didn't know him well enough.
I won't miss him.

930
01:29:18.374 --> 01:29:22.874
Nick, when you recollect your childhood,
are your recollections pleasing to you?

931
01:29:26.999 --> 01:29:30.124
Number one. I don't remember
how often I used to jerk off,

932
01:29:30.332 --> 01:29:31.123
but it was a lot.

933
01:29:31.791 --> 01:29:34.791
Number two. I wasn't pissed off
at my dad, even when I was old enough

934
01:29:34.957 --> 01:29:37.623
to know what he and mom were doing
in the bedroom. Number three.

935
01:29:38.416 --> 01:29:40.707
I don't look in the toilet
before I flush it. Number four.

936
01:29:40.916 --> 01:29:44.457
I haven't wet my bed for a long time.
Number five.

937
01:29:46.249 --> 01:29:47.790
Why don't the two of you
go fuck yourselves?

938
01:29:48.374 --> 01:29:49.332
I'm outta here.

939
01:29:57.457 --> 01:29:59.415
What is your problem?
I'm trying to help you.

940
01:29:59.582 --> 01:30:01.332
- Why won't you let me help you?
- I don't want your help. All right?

941
01:30:01.499 --> 01:30:03.082
- I don't need your help.
- Yes, you do.

942
01:30:03.374 --> 01:30:06.665
Something's going on.
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?

943
01:30:07.624 --> 01:30:10.999
- What is this interest you've got in her?
- My interest is in you, not her.

944
01:30:11.499 --> 01:30:13.457
She seduces people,
she manipulates people.

945
01:30:13.624 --> 01:30:15.499
- She'll do anything she can--
- I thought you hardly knew her.

946
01:30:16.249 --> 01:30:18.124
I know the type.
I'm a psychologist.

947
01:30:18.749 --> 01:30:21.124
That means you manipulate
people too, Beth?

948
01:30:21.874 --> 01:30:25.124
You're a practicing psychologist.
You're better at it than she is.

949
01:30:27.707 --> 01:30:29.207
I feel sorry for you, Nick.

950
01:30:58.374 --> 01:30:59.290
Catherine!

951
01:31:05.707 --> 01:31:06.623
Catherine!

952
01:31:27.999 --> 01:31:29.540
I should have known. I...

953
01:31:33.957 --> 01:31:38.123
I came into the house...
when you were down on the beach.

954
01:31:40.166 --> 01:31:42.249
She looked at me so strangely.

955
01:31:45.416 --> 01:31:47.166
She left right after you.

956
01:31:52.291 --> 01:31:53.207
I...

957
01:31:55.291 --> 01:31:57.291
I shouldn't have let her watch us.

958
01:32:00.332 --> 01:32:02.332
She wanted to watch me all the time.

959
01:32:09.457 --> 01:32:11.290
She tried to kill you,
didn't she?

960
01:32:13.749 --> 01:32:14.999
Did you like her to watch you?

961
01:32:15.541 --> 01:32:17.291
Do you think I told her to kill you?

962
01:32:18.124 --> 01:32:19.082
No.

963
01:32:23.082 --> 01:32:27.582
Everybody that I care about dies.

964
01:32:34.791 --> 01:32:36.041
It's okay. It's okay.

965
01:32:43.082 --> 01:32:43.915
It's okay.

966
01:32:48.624 --> 01:32:49.832
Make love to me.

967
01:33:09.916 --> 01:33:11.749
Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?

968
01:33:13.874 --> 01:33:15.624
For what? To set me up?

969
01:33:17.124 --> 01:33:18.999
She loved me.
She wouldn't frame me.

970
01:33:20.416 --> 01:33:22.374
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny too.

971
01:33:23.582 --> 01:33:24.457
No, she didn't.

972
01:33:25.332 --> 01:33:27.373
She never got jealous before.

973
01:33:27.832 --> 01:33:29.207
She got excited.

974
01:33:32.957 --> 01:33:34.415
I don't have luck with women.

975
01:33:37.374 --> 01:33:38.415
There was this girl...

976
01:33:39.624 --> 01:33:41.165
I met while I was in college.

977
01:33:42.207 --> 01:33:43.665
I slept with her once.

978
01:33:44.624 --> 01:33:47.124
She started following me around,
taking my picture.

979
01:33:48.624 --> 01:33:51.749
She dyed her hair,
copied my clothes.

980
01:33:53.041 --> 01:33:53.957
Lisa...

981
01:33:55.999 --> 01:33:57.832
something Oberman.

982
01:34:02.207 --> 01:34:03.332
It was awful.

983
01:34:06.207 --> 01:34:08.248
I thought you didn't make confessions.

984
01:34:12.416 --> 01:34:13.832
I never did before.

985
01:34:24.666 --> 01:34:25.791
Another nice girl.

986
01:34:44.874 --> 01:34:46.207
How old was she when it happened?

987
01:34:46.582 --> 01:34:47.540
Sixteen.

988
01:34:48.541 --> 01:34:50.791
We seal juvenile records
until they're deceased.

989
01:34:51.166 --> 01:34:52.832
That's why you couldn't
find it in your computer.

990
01:34:53.749 --> 01:34:54.665
What was the motive?

991
01:34:55.999 --> 01:34:58.624
She said she didn't know herself.
Just sort of did it on impulse.

992
01:34:59.124 --> 01:35:00.457
The razor just happened to be there.

993
01:35:01.916 --> 01:35:02.707
It's what she said.

994
01:35:08.499 --> 01:35:10.332
If you want,
help yourself to some coffee.

995
01:35:10.541 --> 01:35:11.457
Thanks.

996
01:35:12.624 --> 01:35:14.915
I don't understand what the
hell's going on here, Gus.

997
01:35:15.416 --> 01:35:16.666
Ain't that hard, hos.

998
01:35:16.916 --> 01:35:19.416
This young farm girl got
tired of all that attention

999
01:35:19.582 --> 01:35:22.373
going to her little brothers,
so she fixed them.

1000
01:35:23.666 --> 01:35:26.374
Just like ole Hazel Dobkins
fixed her whole family.

1001
01:35:26.624 --> 01:35:28.832
Except young Roxy here
didn't use a wedding present.

1002
01:35:29.416 --> 01:35:30.749
She used daddy's razor.

1003
01:35:41.249 --> 01:35:43.790
It sure makes you wonder what they talked
about when they set themselves down

1004
01:35:43.957 --> 01:35:45.457
in front of the campfire at night.

1005
01:35:45.999 --> 01:35:48.207
You ever met a friend of hers
who hasn't killed somebody?

1006
01:35:49.416 --> 01:35:51.791
It must have beat your ordinary,
everyday girl talk.

1007
01:35:52.499 --> 01:35:54.082
I'm not sure anymore if she did it.

1008
01:35:55.082 --> 01:35:56.832
Which one are we talking about now, hos?

1009
01:35:57.166 --> 01:36:00.041
We know ole Hazel did it.
We know young Roxy did it.

1010
01:36:00.457 --> 01:36:01.373
And the other one...

1011
01:36:01.916 --> 01:36:05.832
Well, she got that magna cum laude pussy
on her that done fried up your brain.

1012
01:36:26.457 --> 01:36:28.748
Oberman, Mark W., Donald M.

1013
01:36:30.082 --> 01:36:31.248
Sorry. No Lisa.

1014
01:36:31.791 --> 01:36:32.874
You sure about the year?

1015
01:36:34.249 --> 01:36:37.165
Catherine Tramell graduated in '83.
Yeah.

1016
01:36:37.332 --> 01:36:39.790
She said Lisa Oberman
was here at the same time.

1017
01:36:43.957 --> 01:36:45.248
Yeah, we have Tramell.

1018
01:36:49.249 --> 01:36:50.332
But no Lisa Oberman.

1019
01:36:50.999 --> 01:36:52.957
Are you sure about that?
There can't be a mistake?

1020
01:36:54.832 --> 01:36:56.915
Only if you're making it, Detective.

1021
01:37:09.332 --> 01:37:10.290
Hi.

1022
01:37:11.832 --> 01:37:13.998
Hazel, this is Nick.
I told you all about him.

1023
01:37:14.457 --> 01:37:15.957
Nick, this is Hazel Dobkins.

1024
01:37:16.666 --> 01:37:19.957
You're the shooter,
aren't you? Well, how are you?

1025
01:37:21.082 --> 01:37:23.373
Fine. Thank you.
Can I speak to you for a minute, please?

1026
01:37:24.082 --> 01:37:26.373
Honey, would you wait for me in the car?
I'll be right there.

1027
01:37:29.291 --> 01:37:30.291
Goodbye, Shooter.

1028
01:37:32.749 --> 01:37:34.499
You like to hang out
with murderers or what?

1029
01:37:35.749 --> 01:37:38.040
- You know that Roxy was--
- Yes, of course I knew.

1030
01:37:38.832 --> 01:37:41.707
Look, I write about unusual people,
and sometimes when I do my research,

1031
01:37:41.874 --> 01:37:43.124
I get involved with them.

1032
01:37:44.499 --> 01:37:45.457
It happened with you.

1033
01:37:47.999 --> 01:37:49.374
Killing isn't like smoking.

1034
01:37:50.832 --> 01:37:51.832
You can quit.

1035
01:37:55.374 --> 01:37:56.415
I've got to go.

1036
01:37:58.957 --> 01:38:00.915
I promised I'd get her home
by six o'clock.

1037
01:38:01.249 --> 01:38:03.290
She just loves America's Most Wanted.

1038
01:38:03.874 --> 01:38:06.624
There was no Lisa Oberman
when you were at Berkeley.

1039
01:38:07.541 --> 01:38:09.791
What are you doing?
Checking up on me?

1040
01:38:10.916 --> 01:38:11.832
For what?

1041
01:38:12.749 --> 01:38:13.832
I said Hoberman.

1042
01:38:16.916 --> 01:38:19.332
Hoberman. Lisa Hoberman.
With an H.

1043
01:38:22.291 --> 01:38:23.124
You do?

1044
01:38:26.249 --> 01:38:27.332
All right.
Thank you very much.

1045
01:38:33.207 --> 01:38:34.582
You know I can get my
butt kicked for this.

1046
01:38:35.457 --> 01:38:36.415
You're not even supposed to be in here.

1047
01:38:36.582 --> 01:38:37.998
Come on, Sam.
It's only gonna take a minute.

1048
01:38:38.166 --> 01:38:39.624
Yeah.

1049
01:38:48.624 --> 01:38:49.624
Bring it up.

1050
01:38:53.124 --> 01:38:54.374
It's Dr. Garner, isn't it?

1051
01:38:57.957 --> 01:38:58.998
Bring up '83.

1052
01:39:17.374 --> 01:39:18.624
You shouldn't leave your door open.

1053
01:39:21.166 --> 01:39:23.499
I didn't There's something
wrong with my lock.

1054
01:39:24.541 --> 01:39:25.332
What do you want, Nick?

1055
01:39:25.541 --> 01:39:26.707
Tell me about Catherine.

1056
01:39:29.791 --> 01:39:30.791
She told you, didn't she?

1057
01:39:32.499 --> 01:39:33.749
What did she tell me, Beth?

1058
01:39:37.874 --> 01:39:39.499
I slept with her once in school.

1059
01:39:40.707 --> 01:39:43.207
I was just a kid.
I was experimenting.

1060
01:39:44.124 --> 01:39:45.374
It was just that one time.

1061
01:39:47.499 --> 01:39:49.249
She developed a fixation on me.

1062
01:39:50.332 --> 01:39:53.248
She styled her hair like mine.
She wore the same kind of clothes I did.

1063
01:39:53.499 --> 01:39:54.540
It scared me.

1064
01:39:58.582 --> 01:39:59.707
Isn't that what she told you?

1065
01:40:01.541 --> 01:40:02.791
She said it was you.

1066
01:40:04.207 --> 01:40:05.957
You dressed like her,
you dyed your hair blond.

1067
01:40:06.166 --> 01:40:08.249
I did dye my hair.
It had nothing to do with her.

1068
01:40:08.416 --> 01:40:10.707
- I was a redhead for a while too.
- Did you know Noah Goldstein?

1069
01:40:10.916 --> 01:40:11.832
I had him for two classes.

1070
01:40:11.999 --> 01:40:14.665
You saw all the reports, Beth.
Phil copied you. You never said anything.

1071
01:40:14.832 --> 01:40:16.207
Well, what am I supposed to say?

1072
01:40:16.749 --> 01:40:19.874
Hey, guys, I'm not gay,
but I did fuck your suspect.

1073
01:40:21.874 --> 01:40:24.790
I was embarrassed. It was the
only time I've been with a woman.

1074
01:40:28.374 --> 01:40:29.707
She's really sick, you know.

1075
01:40:30.582 --> 01:40:31.623
Do you know what she's doing?

1076
01:40:32.499 --> 01:40:35.040
She knows I went to Berkeley.
She knows I knew Noah.

1077
01:40:35.832 --> 01:40:37.498
She makes up this story about me.

1078
01:40:38.041 --> 01:40:40.166
She's handing you somebody
who's obsessed with her.

1079
01:40:40.332 --> 01:40:42.290
She didn't hand you to me.
She doesn't even know who you are.

1080
01:40:42.457 --> 01:40:43.915
She told me about a, uh,
Lisa Hoberman.

1081
01:40:44.124 --> 01:40:47.249
She knows you'd find out who Lisa
Hoberman is. You're a good cop.

1082
01:40:48.832 --> 01:40:49.873
Did she tell you casually?

1083
01:40:50.832 --> 01:40:52.040
Make it seem irrelevant?

1084
01:40:54.624 --> 01:40:56.040
I mean,
did she tell you in bed, Nick?

1085
01:41:00.124 --> 01:41:01.124
That's what I'd do.

1086
01:41:04.999 --> 01:41:05.999
Why did you change your name?

1087
01:41:06.791 --> 01:41:08.916
I got married.
He called me Beth.

1088
01:41:09.874 --> 01:41:11.957
He was on staff at the
clinic down in Salinas.

1089
01:41:12.749 --> 01:41:13.665
Didn't last long.

1090
01:41:16.541 --> 01:41:20.541
Nick! God, do you really think
that I could kill someone?

1091
01:41:20.707 --> 01:41:22.332
I mean,
I never even met Johnny Boz.

1092
01:41:22.541 --> 01:41:23.541
And what about Nilsen?

1093
01:41:23.707 --> 01:41:25.957
What possible motive
would I have to kill Nilsen?

1094
01:41:26.124 --> 01:41:27.290
You should get that lock fixed.

1095
01:41:27.666 --> 01:41:28.541
God!

1096
01:41:29.082 --> 01:41:31.665
She is evil.
She is brilliant.

1097
01:41:57.541 --> 01:41:58.624
Did I scare you?

1098
01:42:00.124 --> 01:42:01.332
I wanted to surprise you.

1099
01:42:02.457 --> 01:42:03.457
What's wrong?

1100
01:42:03.957 --> 01:42:05.207
I found Lisa Hoberman.

1101
01:42:05.624 --> 01:42:06.832
Oh, you did?
What is she doing?

1102
01:42:10.916 --> 01:42:12.749
Are you not gonna tell me
what she's doing?

1103
01:42:13.749 --> 01:42:16.082
- I thought we were done playing games.
- I did too.

1104
01:42:17.124 --> 01:42:18.749
She said you got it backwards.

1105
01:42:19.041 --> 01:42:21.207
She said you even styled
your hair like she did.

1106
01:42:22.291 --> 01:42:23.332
And you believed her?

1107
01:42:25.041 --> 01:42:28.166
I had to go down to the campus
police and file a report about her.

1108
01:42:30.749 --> 01:42:33.207
I suppose you still think
I kill people too, right?

1109
01:42:34.791 --> 01:42:35.707
No.

1110
01:42:38.416 --> 01:42:39.416
Liar.

1111
01:42:44.332 --> 01:42:46.957
- So who'd you say you're with?
- Homicide. San Francisco.

1112
01:42:50.374 --> 01:42:51.332
Here we go.

1113
01:42:52.874 --> 01:42:53.749
Kind of.

1114
01:42:54.624 --> 01:42:58.040
There was a report about a Lisa Hoberman,
January 1980, but it's outta here.

1115
01:42:58.207 --> 01:42:59.082
Who's got it?

1116
01:43:00.874 --> 01:43:03.540
One of your guys, Nilsen.
You know him?

1117
01:43:04.291 --> 01:43:06.166
Yeah. Thanks a lot.

1118
01:43:07.624 --> 01:43:09.915
Yeah. Tell him to bring it back,
will you? He's had it a whole year.

1119
01:43:10.999 --> 01:43:14.040
So Nilsen had a report on Beth. So what?
You don't know what the hell was in it?

1120
01:43:14.207 --> 01:43:15.332
Catherine told me what was in it.

1121
01:43:15.499 --> 01:43:18.165
- If she's telling you the truth.
- Oh, Gus, don't you get it?

1122
01:43:18.541 --> 01:43:20.541
If Beth killed Johnny Boz
to frame Catherine,

1123
01:43:20.707 --> 01:43:22.498
she wouldn't want anybody to
know what happened in Berkeley.

1124
01:43:22.666 --> 01:43:25.541
But Nilsen found out about it.
And that gives her the motive to kill him.

1125
01:43:26.082 --> 01:43:28.707
Well, how did she know Nilsen found out,
if it happened?

1126
01:43:28.874 --> 01:43:30.915
He was IA.
He-he probably asked her.

1127
01:43:31.166 --> 01:43:33.791
She'd have to be nuttier than
a 20 pound Christmas fruitcake.

1128
01:43:33.957 --> 01:43:36.582
She's not the one who hangs
out with multiple murderers,

1129
01:43:36.791 --> 01:43:38.416
- your girlfriend is.
- She's a writer, all right.

1130
01:43:38.582 --> 01:43:40.082
- That's her job.
- I don't buy it.

1131
01:43:40.249 --> 01:43:42.457
There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley
who knows what the hell happened.

1132
01:43:42.624 --> 01:43:44.457
I know what happened,
all right. Catherine told me.

1133
01:43:44.624 --> 01:43:47.749
- And everything she says has checked out.
- You got goddamn tweety-birds

1134
01:43:47.916 --> 01:43:48.749
- Fuck you, man.
- Fluttering around in your head.

1135
01:43:48.916 --> 01:43:49.749
- That's what you got.
- Fuck it!

1136
01:43:50.041 --> 01:43:53.707
You think you can fuck like minks,
raise rugrats and live happily ever after?

1137
01:43:54.166 --> 01:43:55.291
Oh man!

1138
01:44:08.249 --> 01:44:09.249
How'd you get in here?

1139
01:44:10.874 --> 01:44:12.707
What's, uh, what's this?

1140
01:44:13.041 --> 01:44:14.791
I decided to give you a second chance.

1141
01:44:16.082 --> 01:44:17.082
I missed you.

1142
01:44:17.291 --> 01:44:19.207
I wasn't gone long enough
for you to miss me.

1143
01:44:20.416 --> 01:44:21.416
Did you miss me?

1144
01:44:22.541 --> 01:44:23.499
No.

1145
01:44:26.582 --> 01:44:27.540
Now?

1146
01:44:30.332 --> 01:44:31.207
No.

1147
01:44:34.166 --> 01:44:36.082
Why don't you come over here
and tell me no?

1148
01:44:41.082 --> 01:44:42.248
I've seen 'em before.

1149
01:44:42.749 --> 01:44:44.665
Yeah?
Well, you might not see 'em again.

1150
01:44:46.166 --> 01:44:47.624
My book's nearly finished.

1151
01:44:48.124 --> 01:44:50.124
And my detective's almost dead.

1152
01:44:50.707 --> 01:44:53.623
- So I got time for a last cigarette?
- Afterwards.

1153
01:45:06.499 --> 01:45:08.540
I've got to do some research
tomorrow morning.

1154
01:45:09.374 --> 01:45:11.124
I'm good at research.
I'll help you.

1155
01:45:12.374 --> 01:45:13.290
No thanks.

1156
01:45:14.291 --> 01:45:15.374
What are you researching?

1157
01:45:16.499 --> 01:45:19.582
Oh.
A new ending to your book.

1158
01:45:20.916 --> 01:45:23.207
Oh really? What's the twist?

1159
01:45:23.957 --> 01:45:26.957
- The detective falls for
the wrong girl... - Uh-huh.

1160
01:45:27.957 --> 01:45:28.998
...but he doesn't die.

1161
01:45:32.457 --> 01:45:33.665
So what happens to them?

1162
01:45:36.541 --> 01:45:41.041
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats,
and live happily ever after.

1163
01:45:43.624 --> 01:45:44.624
It won't sell.

1164
01:45:46.957 --> 01:45:47.748
Why not?

1165
01:45:49.791 --> 01:45:51.041
Somebody has to die.

1166
01:45:54.832 --> 01:45:55.790
Why?

1167
01:45:57.707 --> 01:45:59.082
Somebody always does.

1168
01:46:17.624 --> 01:46:19.790
Good morning.
I'm looking for a Dr. Garner.

1169
01:46:19.957 --> 01:46:21.373
Oh, she doesn't work here anymore.

1170
01:46:21.624 --> 01:46:23.665
I think she's up in San
Francisco with the police.

1171
01:46:23.832 --> 01:46:26.582
Actually, I'm looking for her husband.
He works here too, doesn't he?

1172
01:46:26.999 --> 01:46:28.415
- Dr. Joseph Garner?
- Yeah.

1173
01:46:28.791 --> 01:46:30.124
- Was she married?
- You know him?

1174
01:46:30.499 --> 01:46:32.665
He died about five or six years ago.

1175
01:46:33.499 --> 01:46:35.790
- How did he die?
- He was shot.

1176
01:46:39.457 --> 01:46:40.373
Thank you.

1177
01:46:43.791 --> 01:46:44.957
He was walking home from work.

1178
01:46:45.707 --> 01:46:47.415
They only lived a couple of
blocks away from the clinic.

1179
01:46:48.291 --> 01:46:50.832
- Somebody just drove by and shot him.
- What was the murder weapon?

1180
01:46:51.124 --> 01:46:54.207
Revolver, .38. Unrecovered.
Watch yourself.

1181
01:46:54.749 --> 01:46:55.749
Were there any suspects?

1182
01:46:56.249 --> 01:46:59.290
No suspects,
no motive. Unsolved.

1183
01:46:59.791 --> 01:47:01.291
Was his wife ever a suspect?

1184
01:47:03.749 --> 01:47:06.582
You know, one of your guys was down
here from 'Frisco, about a year ago.

1185
01:47:06.874 --> 01:47:08.749
He was asking the same exact thing.

1186
01:47:09.499 --> 01:47:11.165
Do you mind telling me
what the hell is going on?

1187
01:47:11.332 --> 01:47:13.373
- Routine.
- Routine?

1188
01:47:14.041 --> 01:47:15.499
Yeah.
That's exactly what he said.

1189
01:47:16.082 --> 01:47:18.748
Now I got two of you guys come down
here and telling me it's "routine”.

1190
01:47:19.249 --> 01:47:20.832
Do you remember what the
other guy's name was?

1191
01:47:22.457 --> 01:47:25.790
No.
Can't really say that I do.

1192
01:47:26.707 --> 01:47:27.665
Nilsen?

1193
01:47:29.374 --> 01:47:30.749
Nilsen. Yeah, that was it.

1194
01:47:33.791 --> 01:47:36.041
- So was she ever a suspect?
- Nope.

1195
01:47:37.499 --> 01:47:40.165
There was some talk,
but it never panned out.

1196
01:47:41.082 --> 01:47:41.998
What kind of talk?

1197
01:47:43.207 --> 01:47:44.040
Girlfriend.

1198
01:47:44.666 --> 01:47:45.707
What? He had a girlfriend?

1199
01:47:46.832 --> 01:47:47.623
No.

1200
01:47:49.832 --> 01:47:50.707
She did.

1201
01:47:53.582 --> 01:47:54.373
Like I said,

1202
01:47:54.832 --> 01:47:55.790
it never panned out.

1203
01:47:58.999 --> 01:48:01.249
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Hope I helped you out.

1204
01:48:01.832 --> 01:48:04.498
Yes, you did. You sure did.

1205
01:48:07.541 --> 01:48:08.416
Catherine!

1206
01:48:35.499 --> 01:48:37.207
Hi. I missed you.

1207
01:48:39.999 --> 01:48:41.249
I finished my research.

1208
01:48:41.416 --> 01:48:42.832
- I finished my book.
- Yeah?

1209
01:48:43.666 --> 01:48:44.541
So how does it end?

1210
01:48:45.707 --> 01:48:48.582
I told you. She kills him.

1211
01:48:52.332 --> 01:48:53.332
Goodbye, Nick.

1212
01:48:56.124 --> 01:48:57.124
Goodbye?

1213
01:48:58.457 --> 01:49:00.707
Yeah. I finished my book.

1214
01:49:03.541 --> 01:49:06.749
Didn't you hear me?
Your character's dead.

1215
01:49:09.249 --> 01:49:10.332
Goodbye.

1216
01:49:15.374 --> 01:49:18.874
What do you want? Flowers?
I'll send you an autographed copy.

1217
01:49:21.416 --> 01:49:23.041
What is this?
Some kind of joke?

1218
01:49:28.749 --> 01:49:29.915
You playing a game here?

1219
01:49:31.291 --> 01:49:32.374
Games are over.

1220
01:49:34.749 --> 01:49:39.249
You were right.
It was the fuck of the century, Shooter.

1221
01:49:44.791 --> 01:49:45.749
Catherine?

1222
01:49:54.249 --> 01:49:55.124
I'll be right there.

1223
01:50:23.124 --> 01:50:25.915
Catherine Tramell's roommate,
freshman year. I just got a call from her.

1224
01:50:26.082 --> 01:50:27.707
She's over in Oakland.
Come on.

1225
01:50:31.124 --> 01:50:33.207
I've been phoning people
from her dorm all day.

1226
01:50:33.374 --> 01:50:34.832
She must have heard
I was trying to reach her.

1227
01:50:34.999 --> 01:50:38.124
She says she knows all about
Catherine and Lisa Hoberman.

1228
01:50:41.624 --> 01:50:42.707
You feeling okay?

1229
01:50:43.332 --> 01:50:44.290
Yeah.

1230
01:50:45.082 --> 01:50:45.998
Here's something else.

1231
01:50:46.541 --> 01:50:49.749
Johnny Boz's psychiatrist
has an office on Van Ness.

1232
01:50:50.124 --> 01:50:53.957
Guess who he shares office space with?
Doctor Elizabeth Garner.

1233
01:50:57.499 --> 01:50:58.790
What in hell's the matter with you?

1234
01:51:01.166 --> 01:51:01.999
Hmm?

1235
01:51:14.291 --> 01:51:16.082
I'll be in Suite 405.

1236
01:51:19.041 --> 01:51:21.166
- Where the hell are you going?
- Going with you.

1237
01:51:21.582 --> 01:51:24.373
You're on leave, hos.
It ain't gonna take long.

1238
01:52:41.124 --> 01:52:42.082
Gus!

1239
01:53:12.416 --> 01:53:13.249
Gus!

1240
01:53:28.874 --> 01:53:29.790
Gus.

1241
01:53:48.582 --> 01:53:49.415
Freeze!

1242
01:53:50.332 --> 01:53:51.415
What are you doing here?

1243
01:53:51.624 --> 01:53:53.332
Put your hands up.
Put your fucking hands up.

1244
01:53:53.541 --> 01:53:55.999
I got a message on my machine
to meet Gus here. Where is he?

1245
01:53:56.166 --> 01:53:57.707
Don't move. Don't you move.

1246
01:53:58.082 --> 01:54:00.415
I know about your husband.
You still like girls, Beth?

1247
01:54:01.666 --> 01:54:02.582
What?

1248
01:54:04.124 --> 01:54:05.040
Take your hands out of your pockets.

1249
01:54:05.707 --> 01:54:07.415
- Take 'em out!
- What's wrong with you?

1250
01:54:07.624 --> 01:54:08.290
Take 'em out.

1251
01:54:28.999 --> 01:54:29.999
I loved you.

1252
01:54:47.249 --> 01:54:48.540
Oh, God!

1253
01:55:12.374 --> 01:55:13.624
What makes you think she had a gun?

1254
01:55:16.416 --> 01:55:18.374
What the hell was she doing here?
What was Gus doing here?

1255
01:55:20.707 --> 01:55:21.582
Nick?

1256
01:55:23.541 --> 01:55:24.499
Lieutenant.

1257
01:55:54.082 --> 01:55:54.873
One of ours.

1258
01:55:57.707 --> 01:55:58.623
Jesus.

1259
01:56:00.332 --> 01:56:01.665
We'll have to check Beth's apartment.

1260
01:56:06.124 --> 01:56:07.415
Thirty-eight caliber revolver.

1261
01:56:07.624 --> 01:56:08.957
In the bookcase behind some books.

1262
01:56:12.999 --> 01:56:14.290
Have ballistics check it for Nilsen.

1263
01:56:16.207 --> 01:56:18.040
Lieutenant,
you'd better come in here.

1264
01:56:47.999 --> 01:56:48.957
I guess that's it.

1265
01:57:10.332 --> 01:57:11.873
We checked. It's her size.

1266
01:57:12.416 --> 01:57:14.624
She must've heard you on the
stairway and dumped the stuff.

1267
01:57:14.791 --> 01:57:16.457
There's no suite 405
in that building.

1268
01:57:16.624 --> 01:57:18.415
Catherine Tramell's roommate
in her freshman year is dead.

1269
01:57:18.582 --> 01:57:20.165
She died of leukemia two years ago.

1270
01:57:20.332 --> 01:57:22.415
- Here's a fax of her death certificate.
- Okay, but what about Salinas?

1271
01:57:23.249 --> 01:57:24.207
Yeah?

1272
01:57:24.999 --> 01:57:26.207
Hold on. Jack?

1273
01:57:26.957 --> 01:57:30.040
Jack! Did you check Nilsen's office
for any files on Beth Garner?

1274
01:57:30.207 --> 01:57:31.748
- No police report from Berkeley.
- Yeah?

1275
01:57:31.916 --> 01:57:33.707
- Nothing at all about Salinas.
- Okay.

1276
01:57:33.999 --> 01:57:35.832
I'm back. Yeah.

1277
01:57:36.749 --> 01:57:37.624
Great.

1278
01:57:38.541 --> 01:57:41.749
Ballistics says the .38 we found in
her apartment was used on Nilsen.

1279
01:57:41.999 --> 01:57:44.082
No registration.
They're checking with Salinas.

1280
01:57:44.416 --> 01:57:47.082
The icepick was the same brand
and model as the Boz weapon.

1281
01:57:47.291 --> 01:57:49.666
We checked the tape machines at Dr.
Garner's apartment and her office,

1282
01:57:49.832 --> 01:57:52.748
both here and the one on Van Ness.
There's no message from Gus on any of 'em.

1283
01:57:52.916 --> 01:57:54.707
The tape in her apartment was unused.

1284
01:57:55.041 --> 01:57:58.541
And Johnny Boz's psychiatrist says he
thinks he remembers Dr. Garner and Boz

1285
01:57:58.707 --> 01:58:01.748
meeting at a Christmas party
at his house a year ago.

1286
01:58:05.791 --> 01:58:07.249
You just can't tell about people,
can you.

1287
01:58:10.624 --> 01:58:12.415
Even the ones you think
you know inside and out.

1288
01:58:18.082 --> 01:58:19.373
Congratulations, Curran.

1289
01:59:12.957 --> 01:59:13.957
Hi.

1290
01:59:20.249 --> 01:59:21.415
I heard about what happened...

1291
01:59:24.416 --> 01:59:25.332
on TV.

1292
01:59:27.999 --> 01:59:28.832
I...

1293
01:59:38.291 --> 01:59:40.832
I can't allow myself to care about you.

1294
01:59:45.291 --> 01:59:46.749
I can't allow myself...

1295
01:59:48.249 --> 01:59:49.165
to care...

1296
01:59:53.874 --> 01:59:58.374
I don't wanna do this.
Please, I don't wanna do this. I...

1297
02:00:00.582 --> 02:00:02.040
I lose everybody.

1298
02:00:03.374 --> 02:00:04.665
I don't wanna lose you.

1299
02:00:12.082 --> 02:00:13.373
I don't wanna lose you.

1300
02:01:52.041 --> 02:01:53.499
What do we do now, Nick?

1301
02:01:55.416 --> 02:01:56.874
Fuck like minks...

1302
02:01:59.166 --> 02:02:01.916
raise rugrats and live happily ever after.

1303
02:02:13.707 --> 02:02:14.957
I hate rugrats.

1304
02:02:18.166 --> 02:02:22.666
Fuck like minks, forget the rugrats,
and live happily ever after.
