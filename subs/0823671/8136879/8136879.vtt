00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.242
<i>Have you ever wondered
how nature gets its glow?</i>

2
00:01:01.935 --> 00:01:03.820
<i>Who gives it light and color
as the seasons come and go?</i>

3
00:01:03.843 --> 00:01:07.143
<i>Who helps all creatures,
great and small,</i>

4
00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:09.728
<i>to walk, to swim, to fly?</i>

5
00:01:12.169 --> 00:01:14.404
<i>Who crafts such tiny details?</i>

6
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:19.775
<i>You might see them if you try.</i>

7
00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:26.787
<i>For it's all the work of fairies,
but they stay well out of sight.</i>

8
00:01:33.836 --> 00:01:38.469
<i>And the first time that a baby laughs,
a fairy's life takes flight.</i>

9
00:01:39.724 --> 00:01:41.153
<i>When the moon comes out</i>

10
00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.300
<i>To shine her face</i>

11
00:01:43.404 --> 00:01:46.056
<i>The birds are fast asleep</i>

12
00:01:46.157 --> 00:01:49.212
<i>And the lanterns hang from every post</i>

13
00:01:49.213 --> 00:01:52.268
The fairies leave their keep

14
00:01:52.365 --> 00:01:55.912
<i>They join their hands
and sing their songs</i>

15
00:01:56.014 --> 00:01:58.797
<i>That nary a soul can hear</i>

16
00:01:58.895 --> 00:02:01.677
<i>In the springtime
when the earth is new</i>

17
00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.246
<i>To the fairies they draw near</i>

18
00:02:06.351 --> 00:02:13.030
<i>To the fairies they draw near</i>

19
00:03:36.376 --> 00:03:37.871
- Hello.
- Hello.

20
00:03:37.977 --> 00:03:39.407
- Hello.
- Hi.

21
00:03:39.514 --> 00:03:41.074
- Hello.
- Hello.

22
00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:42.866
Hello?

23
00:03:43.995 --> 00:03:45.424
Queen Clarion.

24
00:03:56.284 --> 00:03:59.251
Born of laughter, clothed in cheer,

25
00:03:59.836 --> 00:04:02.040
happiness has brought you here.

26
00:04:02.555 --> 00:04:06.811
Welcome to Pixie Hollow.
I trust you found your way all right.

27
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.886
I think so.

28
00:04:10.748 --> 00:04:12.985
Now, let's see about those wings.

29
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.508
What are these things?

30
00:04:56.611 --> 00:04:59.261
They will help you
find your talent, little one.

31
00:04:59.362 --> 00:05:01.751
But how will I know which one is...

32
00:05:03.267 --> 00:05:04.609
You'll know.

33
00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:56.607
Hmm.

34
00:06:38.287 --> 00:06:39.245
Whoa!

35
00:06:39.342 --> 00:06:43.369
Never seen one glow that much before,
even for Vidia.

36
00:06:43.631 --> 00:06:45.192
You know,
I do believe you're right.

37
00:06:45.296 --> 00:06:48.971
Little daisy top
might be a very rare talent indeed.

38
00:06:57.135 --> 00:06:59.470
Come forward, tinker fairies,

39
00:06:59.568 --> 00:07:04.357
and welcome the newest member
of your talent guild, Tinker Bell.

40
00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:08.074
Glad we had a bath today, eh, Clank?

41
00:07:08.177 --> 00:07:09.519
- Excuse us!
- Coming through!

42
00:07:09.617 --> 00:07:11.984
Sorry! Make way for tinkers!

43
00:07:13.138 --> 00:07:16.750
Hady-hi, hady-ho, Miss Bell. I'm Clank.

44
00:07:17.362 --> 00:07:20.014
Splinters, Clank. Say it, don't spray it.

45
00:07:20.115 --> 00:07:23.464
Phineas T. Kettletree, Esquire,
at your service.

46
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:24.764
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

47
00:07:24.787 --> 00:07:27.820
Oh, foo! He's Bobble, I'm Clank.

48
00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:30.386
Clank, Bobble.

49
00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:34.574
We're pleased as a pile of
perfectly polished pots you're here.

50
00:07:34.677 --> 00:07:35.692
Uh...

51
00:07:35.925 --> 00:07:36.884
Me, too.

52
00:07:37.973 --> 00:07:40.941
Come on, Miss Bell.
There's so much to show you.

53
00:07:43.349 --> 00:07:47.921
You've arrived
at a most wondrous and glorious time.

54
00:07:48.021 --> 00:07:49.232
Really? Why?

55
00:07:49.334 --> 00:07:52.498
Why, it's almost time
for the changing of the seasons.

56
00:07:52.598 --> 00:07:56.722
You see, here in Pixie Hollow, there are
different realms for every time of year.

57
00:07:56.822 --> 00:07:57.858
Well, there's one up ahead.

58
00:08:02.712 --> 00:08:05.811
Winter Woods. It's always cold here.

59
00:08:05.911 --> 00:08:09.359
Look there! Snowflake and frost fairies
returning home for...

60
00:08:09.464 --> 00:08:12.017
For some well-deserved rest.

61
00:08:12.121 --> 00:08:15.504
Aye. They've just finished
bringing winter to the world.

62
00:08:16.858 --> 00:08:19.411
It's the off-season
for the autumn fairies, too.

63
00:08:19.514 --> 00:08:22.678
Always practicing
that perfect shade of amber, eh?

64
00:08:22.778 --> 00:08:24.502
And the fairies of Summer Glade

65
00:08:24.602 --> 00:08:26.513
still have plenty of time to get ready.

66
00:08:26.619 --> 00:08:28.724
But not as much
as the autumn fairies,

67
00:08:28.826 --> 00:08:30.201
of course, because, well...

68
00:08:30.299 --> 00:08:33.649
Yes, Clanky. Because
right now, fairies of every talent

69
00:08:33.755 --> 00:08:36.918
are preparing for my favorite season,
springtime!

70
00:08:38.395 --> 00:08:39.355
Oh!

71
00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:45.169
Get along.
Get along, little sproutlings, and dig.

72
00:08:49.981 --> 00:08:51.322
Hello, there!

73
00:08:52.669 --> 00:08:55.833
Come on, Miss Bell.
You've got to see where we live.

74
00:09:01.949 --> 00:09:04.023
Welcome to Tinker's Nook.

75
00:09:04.126 --> 00:09:06.166
Oh, wow!

76
00:09:15.328 --> 00:09:16.288
Oh.

77
00:09:17.728 --> 00:09:20.281
Come on.
There's so much to show you.

78
00:09:42.434 --> 00:09:43.514
Cute.

79
00:09:45.411 --> 00:09:46.720
Just taking some supplies down...

80
00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.438
They're taking supplies
down to the workshop.

81
00:09:52.131 --> 00:09:53.440
Let her go.

82
00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:55.011
Watch out for falling...

83
00:09:55.109 --> 00:09:57.443
Watch out for falling maple seeds!

84
00:10:00.773 --> 00:10:01.787
Wow!

85
00:10:12.102 --> 00:10:15.102
And over here is where most of us live.
There's your house...

86
00:10:15.207 --> 00:10:17.411
There's your house, Tinker Bell.

87
00:10:22.599 --> 00:10:24.291
- It's mine?
- Sure is.

88
00:10:24.968 --> 00:10:27.008
We were hoping the new arrival
would be one of us,

89
00:10:27.111 --> 00:10:29.413
so we got the place all ready.

90
00:10:29.512 --> 00:10:30.853
We rounded up some work clothes...

91
00:10:30.951 --> 00:10:33.254
- We didn't know your size.
- Yes, our apologies, but...

92
00:10:33.352 --> 00:10:35.873
- But they might be too big.
- Yeah, well, that's only...

93
00:10:35.977 --> 00:10:38.050
'Cause you're so tiny.

94
00:10:38.153 --> 00:10:39.561
That'll do, Clank.

95
00:10:39.657 --> 00:10:41.926
Please come on down to the workshop
when you're ready.

96
00:10:42.025 --> 00:10:43.717
Fairy Mary will want to meet you.

97
00:10:43.818 --> 00:10:44.996
Goodbye.

98
00:10:52.682 --> 00:10:53.642
Oh.

99
00:11:36.847 --> 00:11:38.440
Stop! What?

100
00:11:39.024 --> 00:11:42.734
A five-gauge twig for an axle?
Clank, I told you it took a seven.

101
00:11:42.832 --> 00:11:43.978
Oh, you said five.

102
00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:48.042
I said seven! Oh, Clank, I tell you,
sometimes you can be pretty,

103
00:11:48.145 --> 00:11:49.356
pretty...

104
00:11:52.338 --> 00:11:54.444
So pretty.

105
00:11:56.242 --> 00:11:59.504
- Who's that, then?
- It's Tinker Bell, you snail brain.

106
00:12:02.644 --> 00:12:04.782
Wow, everyone seems so busy.

107
00:12:04.883 --> 00:12:07.272
Well, spring won't spring itself.

108
00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:11.635
Indeed, my bellowing buddy.
And we tinkers are a big part of it.

109
00:12:11.732 --> 00:12:14.034
Allow us to elucidate, Miss Bell.

110
00:12:14.836 --> 00:12:17.683
- We fiddle and fix.
- We craft and create.

111
00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.628
- We carve acorn buckets.
- To hold flower paint.

112
00:12:20.725 --> 00:12:23.409
- Weave saddles and satchels.
- For birdies, you see.

113
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:26.379
- Make baskets and bushels.
- To carry the seeds!

114
00:12:26.485 --> 00:12:29.071
- When preparing for spring.
- We do all this and more!

115
00:12:29.174 --> 00:12:33.168
- Yes, being a tinker is never a bore!
- Yes, being a tinker is never a bore!

116
00:12:34.646 --> 00:12:35.725
That was great.

117
00:12:35.831 --> 00:12:40.436
So you see, Miss Bell, we help fairies
of every talent with our creations.

118
00:12:40.535 --> 00:12:44.114
Unfortunately, all those fairies
are out of luck this year.

119
00:12:44.216 --> 00:12:46.736
Unless we can actually
deliver these things to them.

120
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.174
The wagon repairs are finished, I trust?

121
00:12:52.632 --> 00:12:54.193
Yes, Fairy Mary.

122
00:12:54.456 --> 00:12:57.304
- Tip-top shape.
- No wheels missing whatsoever!

123
00:12:58.682 --> 00:13:00.089
Then let's see it.

124
00:13:00.185 --> 00:13:02.520
- Ah, you see... Well...
- See,

125
00:13:02.618 --> 00:13:05.717
- with your eyes?
- Define "see," actually...

126
00:13:05.914 --> 00:13:08.566
- You have to meet Tinker Bell!
- What? Who?

127
00:13:08.795 --> 00:13:11.445
- She's new, Fairy Mary.
- Nice to meet you.

128
00:13:11.546 --> 00:13:14.296
Rapture! A new charge on whom
we can lavish

129
00:13:14.394 --> 00:13:17.013
all our tinkering wisdom and expertise!

130
00:13:19.067 --> 00:13:20.889
Let me see those hands.

131
00:13:21.724 --> 00:13:24.539
Teetering teapots, so dainty.

132
00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:28.756
Don't worry, dear. We'll build up those
tinker muscles in no time.

133
00:13:28.924 --> 00:13:29.939
Okay.

134
00:13:30.109 --> 00:13:33.524
- Now, boys, the deliveries?
- Aye, we're on it.

135
00:13:33.629 --> 00:13:36.379
As a matter of fact,
we're heading out right this second.

136
00:13:36.477 --> 00:13:40.188
- But we've only got one wheel.
- What was that?

137
00:13:40.797 --> 00:13:44.475
Nothing really,
Clank was just asking...

138
00:13:44.575 --> 00:13:46.844
If I can go as well!

139
00:13:47.295 --> 00:13:49.816
- Yeah! Good one. Very nice.
- Yes! I wondered that,

140
00:13:49.919 --> 00:13:54.197
- if you could go with us. Yes.
- That's exactly what he was saying.

141
00:13:54.752 --> 00:13:56.476
Very well. Get on with it, then.

142
00:13:58.496 --> 00:14:01.115
Slow down, Cheese, I can't keep up!

143
00:14:02.273 --> 00:14:04.182
The mouse's name is Cheese?

144
00:14:04.288 --> 00:14:07.005
Must be.
He always comes when we yell it.

145
00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:37.050
Sprinting thistles!
Bobble! Bobble!

146
00:15:11.624 --> 00:15:16.611
Easy. Easy, boy. It's all right.
Fawn's got you.

147
00:15:17.864 --> 00:15:22.088
Easy. Easy, girl. It's all right.
Silvermist's got you.

148
00:15:23.241 --> 00:15:24.616
Oh, you all right, sugar cane?

149
00:15:24.713 --> 00:15:26.056
Be careful, Rosetta, she may faint!

150
00:15:27.114 --> 00:15:29.797
Elevate her legs. No, wait.
I mean her head.

151
00:15:29.898 --> 00:15:31.731
Wait, wait, wait. Okay.
If she's red, raise the head.

152
00:15:31.755 --> 00:15:33.827
If she's pale, raise the tail.

153
00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:35.914
Does she look pale or red?

154
00:15:36.044 --> 00:15:37.735
She looks squished.

155
00:15:38.443 --> 00:15:39.556
Sorry.

156
00:15:39.788 --> 00:15:42.788
Here, let me, raindrop.
So, what happened to you, anyway?

157
00:15:42.892 --> 00:15:45.129
- Well, I...
- It was sprinting thistles!

158
00:15:46.285 --> 00:15:48.357
Those weeds are an absolute menace.

159
00:15:48.461 --> 00:15:51.757
Always trampling things,
poking people in the petunia.

160
00:15:53.166 --> 00:15:54.626
Gather round, ladies.

161
00:15:54.733 --> 00:15:56.075
We've brought some selections

162
00:15:56.172 --> 00:15:59.206
from the new spring line
of tinker specialties!

163
00:15:59.309 --> 00:16:00.836
- All right!
- Show us, show us!

164
00:16:00.942 --> 00:16:03.844
- What'd you bring?
- Your rainbow tubes, Iridessa.

165
00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:06.503
Finally! Silvermist,
could you help me?

166
00:16:16.656 --> 00:16:17.638
Oh.

167
00:16:26.353 --> 00:16:27.880
What're you gonna do with that?

168
00:16:27.985 --> 00:16:29.840
I'm gonna take it to the mainland.

169
00:16:29.937 --> 00:16:31.082
What's the mainland?

170
00:16:31.185 --> 00:16:33.128
It's where we're gonna go
change winter to spring.

171
00:16:33.234 --> 00:16:35.755
The seasons change all the time there.

172
00:16:35.923 --> 00:16:38.345
I'll get to apply my artistic sensibilities.

173
00:16:38.451 --> 00:16:41.386
Yeah. And I'll have breakfast ready
for all the wittle fuzzies

174
00:16:41.491 --> 00:16:43.400
coming out of hibernation.

175
00:16:45.364 --> 00:16:47.152
We just follow the second star...

176
00:16:47.251 --> 00:16:49.706
Ride the breeze, follow the waves...

177
00:16:49.811 --> 00:16:51.699
All the way across the sea...

178
00:16:51.795 --> 00:16:53.585
And then, there it is.

179
00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:58.254
Wow! The mainland sounds flitterific!

180
00:17:01.333 --> 00:17:04.978
Yes. The glamorous lives
of the nature-talent fairies, eh?

181
00:17:05.077 --> 00:17:06.484
We'd love to stay and chat, but...

182
00:17:06.581 --> 00:17:10.094
But we tinkers
have real work to do. Right?

183
00:17:10.198 --> 00:17:13.297
- Don't get your wings in a bunch.
- Don't be like that.

184
00:17:13.398 --> 00:17:14.773
Nice to meet you all!

185
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:17.969
- You, too! Fly with you later!
- Fly with you later!

186
00:17:20.183 --> 00:17:21.525
Right! Here we are.

187
00:17:21.623 --> 00:17:23.695
A pretty large order of pollen pots
for the...

188
00:17:37.337 --> 00:17:39.858
Last thing is berry bushels
to deliver to the glen...

189
00:17:39.961 --> 00:17:42.101
Is it okay
if I just catch up with you later?

190
00:17:42.202 --> 00:17:43.630
Oh, I suppose.

191
00:17:44.377 --> 00:17:46.352
Can you find your way back?

192
00:17:46.681 --> 00:17:49.464
- Yeah, yeah. Sure I can.
- Well, I...

193
00:17:49.657 --> 00:17:52.113
- All right, then.
- Just be careful!

194
00:17:55.451 --> 00:17:56.410
Hi, there!

195
00:17:59.131 --> 00:18:00.277
Sorry.

196
00:18:00.668 --> 00:18:02.075
Vidia, right?

197
00:18:08.733 --> 00:18:11.450
We didn't officially meet.
I'm Tinker Bell.

198
00:18:12.221 --> 00:18:13.431
Oh, yes.

199
00:18:14.749 --> 00:18:15.895
The new girl.

200
00:18:15.997 --> 00:18:19.478
That's right! So, what's your talent?

201
00:18:21.342 --> 00:18:23.196
What do you think it is?

202
00:18:23.774 --> 00:18:29.044
You're a pollen-izer? Pollen-ator?
Pollen-picker? Pollen-plucker?

203
00:18:29.152 --> 00:18:32.632
I am a fast-flying fairy,
a true rare talent.

204
00:18:33.087 --> 00:18:35.455
And this is but a small part of what I do.

205
00:18:35.552 --> 00:18:39.064
I make breezes in the summer,
blow down leaves in the fall.

206
00:18:39.168 --> 00:18:41.852
My winds even brought you here, dear.

207
00:18:41.952 --> 00:18:44.702
Fairies of every talent depend on me.

208
00:18:45.599 --> 00:18:47.869
Hey, that's just like what I do.

209
00:18:49.217 --> 00:18:50.176
Excuse me?

210
00:18:50.305 --> 00:18:52.508
I mean, tinkers help fairies
of every talent, too.

211
00:18:52.609 --> 00:18:55.031
So we're kind of the same, you know?

212
00:18:57.314 --> 00:19:00.795
Sweetie, I make forces of nature.

213
00:19:01.283 --> 00:19:02.908
You make pots and kettles.

214
00:19:03.011 --> 00:19:07.103
I work up in the sky,
and you work down in a ditch.

215
00:19:07.747 --> 00:19:08.762
Hey!

216
00:19:08.867 --> 00:19:11.867
Don't get me wrong, sunshine.
Being a tinker is really swell and all,

217
00:19:11.972 --> 00:19:15.006
but I wouldn't go around
bragging about your talent.

218
00:19:15.108 --> 00:19:17.312
It's not like spring depends on you.

219
00:19:17.412 --> 00:19:18.874
Of course it does!

220
00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:22.429
And when I go to the mainland,
I'll prove just how important we are.

221
00:19:22.534 --> 00:19:24.421
When who goes to the mainland?

222
00:19:24.517 --> 00:19:27.234
Me, of course! For spring!

223
00:19:29.542 --> 00:19:32.096
Oh, of course. You'll prove it, huh?

224
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:33.404
Yes, I will.

225
00:19:33.509 --> 00:19:38.016
Well, I, for one,
am looking forward to that. Excuse me.

226
00:19:39.494 --> 00:19:41.185
No. Excuse me.

227
00:19:46.535 --> 00:19:48.446
"Mine is a rare talent."

228
00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:49.662
Ugh.

229
00:19:51.337 --> 00:19:53.540
Try and tell me tinkers don't matter.

230
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.029
I'll show her what a rare talent really is,
when I...

231
00:21:04.049 --> 00:21:05.031
Oh.

232
00:21:26.643 --> 00:21:29.064
- Hey, Tink, what you got there?
- Oh, hi.

233
00:21:30.291 --> 00:21:32.014
I don't know. I just found them.

234
00:21:33.363 --> 00:21:34.770
Lost things.

235
00:21:35.732 --> 00:21:37.325
- Lost things.
- Aye.

236
00:21:37.428 --> 00:21:41.225
Stuff gets lost and washes up
on Neverland from time to time.

237
00:21:41.333 --> 00:21:42.991
You know, from the mainland.

238
00:21:43.092 --> 00:21:45.133
These come from the mainland?

239
00:21:45.237 --> 00:21:47.790
That place sounds
more fascinating all the time.

240
00:21:47.893 --> 00:21:52.236
Berry bushels, check.
Pollen pots, check. Lost things, check.

241
00:21:52.951 --> 00:21:53.909
Huh?

242
00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:57.682
Lost things?
Why are you fiddling with that junk?

243
00:21:57.782 --> 00:21:59.059
Oh, um...

244
00:21:59.446 --> 00:22:01.967
Well, they were just so unusual.

245
00:22:02.071 --> 00:22:04.438
You mustn't be wasting your time
with that rubbish.

246
00:22:04.536 --> 00:22:06.992
And I won't have it
cluttering up my workshop.

247
00:22:07.096 --> 00:22:08.852
And as for you two,

248
00:22:09.625 --> 00:22:11.893
no more dilly-dallying around.

249
00:22:11.992 --> 00:22:14.295
And don't forget about
the Queen's review tonight.

250
00:22:14.393 --> 00:22:17.142
Goodness, there's still
so much to be done!

251
00:22:20.665 --> 00:22:22.007
Thank you.

252
00:22:22.649 --> 00:22:24.656
Sorry about your trinkets, Miss Bell.

253
00:22:24.761 --> 00:22:27.631
Well, we'd best be getting ready
for the review, anyway.

254
00:22:27.738 --> 00:22:29.810
What is the Queen's review?

255
00:22:29.913 --> 00:22:33.689
You see, the Queen is going to
review all the preparations for spring!

256
00:22:33.787 --> 00:22:37.617
Yeah, it's a good time for us tinkers
to show what we can do, eh?

257
00:22:37.723 --> 00:22:39.414
- Oh, indeed.
- Really?

258
00:22:40.027 --> 00:22:41.937
Like me. I can be a wheel.

259
00:22:42.651 --> 00:22:43.666
Hmm.

260
00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:47.319
Perfect. That's my chance.

261
00:23:42.115 --> 00:23:46.425
Okay, everybody, turn!
Ready for the base coat over here!

262
00:23:56.644 --> 00:24:01.347
Splendid, splendid. Stack those neatly,
plenty of time before the Queen arrives.

263
00:24:01.445 --> 00:24:02.590
It's the Queen!

264
00:24:02.693 --> 00:24:05.660
What? She's here? Now?
Play, music fairies.

265
00:24:06.692 --> 00:24:07.937
Yes, play!

266
00:24:22.792 --> 00:24:24.482
Queen Clarion, Your Illustriousness!

267
00:24:24.583 --> 00:24:28.642
As Minister of Spring,
I welcome you to Springtime Square.

268
00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.142
What? No fireworks, Minister?

269
00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:34.142
Oh, well, yeah, that could be arranged.
Light fairies! Light fairies!

270
00:24:34.248 --> 00:24:37.315
I'm teasing.
You always make such a fuss,

271
00:24:37.416 --> 00:24:40.166
and everything always
turns out wonderfully.

272
00:24:43.049 --> 00:24:45.636
Well, I think you'll find
that we have things well in hand.

273
00:24:45.737 --> 00:24:47.231
When the Everblossom blooms,

274
00:24:47.338 --> 00:24:49.760
we'll be ready to bring
spring to the mainland!

275
00:24:49.866 --> 00:24:52.006
Music to my ears.

276
00:24:52.106 --> 00:24:55.205
I know you've all put in months
of practice and preparation,

277
00:24:55.723 --> 00:24:58.374
but keep up the good work
these last few days,

278
00:24:58.475 --> 00:25:00.418
- because just as fairies...
- Queen Clarion!

279
00:25:02.219 --> 00:25:03.178
Huh?

280
00:25:03.531 --> 00:25:04.938
Queen Clarion!

281
00:25:06.315 --> 00:25:08.520
- Did I miss anything?
- No, no, no.

282
00:25:08.684 --> 00:25:10.113
Phew! Good.

283
00:25:10.668 --> 00:25:11.627
It's all right.

284
00:25:11.724 --> 00:25:13.447
I came up with some fantastic things

285
00:25:13.548 --> 00:25:16.004
for tinkers to use
when we go to the mainland.

286
00:25:18.189 --> 00:25:19.596
What's she talking about?

287
00:25:19.694 --> 00:25:21.221
Let me show you!

288
00:25:22.862 --> 00:25:25.961
First, baby chipmunks
can't eat the whole nut, right?

289
00:25:26.061 --> 00:25:28.299
Their little teeth can't chew big bites.

290
00:25:28.398 --> 00:25:31.715
So you just crank back this lever,
and it's...

291
00:25:40.912 --> 00:25:42.025
Whoops.

292
00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:45.900
- It's kind of a work in progress.
- Yes, yes, yes. Very clever.

293
00:25:48.081 --> 00:25:49.041
Oh!

294
00:25:49.137 --> 00:25:51.626
And I made this, too.
It's a flower-sprayer.

295
00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:54.796
- Tinker Bell, I...
- Here, allow me to demonstrate.

296
00:26:04.211 --> 00:26:05.324
Sorry.

297
00:26:05.811 --> 00:26:09.521
- But wait till you see this last one.
- Tinker Bell, sweetheart,

298
00:26:10.003 --> 00:26:11.694
has no one explained?

299
00:26:13.363 --> 00:26:14.825
Explained what?

300
00:26:15.252 --> 00:26:18.002
Tinker fairies
don't go to the mainland, dear.

301
00:26:18.261 --> 00:26:19.220
What?

302
00:26:19.284 --> 00:26:22.732
All of those things
are done by the nature-talent fairies.

303
00:26:22.836 --> 00:26:25.325
Your work is here in Pixie Hollow.

304
00:26:25.844 --> 00:26:28.911
- But I thought that...
- I'm sorry, Tinker Bell.

305
00:26:31.221 --> 00:26:34.867
Oh, okay. No. No, that's good.

306
00:26:34.966 --> 00:26:37.552
I mean,
I really couldn't make it anyway.

307
00:26:37.655 --> 00:26:42.325
So, good. Yeah.
This actually works out good.

308
00:26:42.808 --> 00:26:47.347
I mean, well...
So, I'm just gonna... Yeah.

309
00:27:04.089 --> 00:27:05.464
Back so soon?

310
00:27:06.138 --> 00:27:07.282
You didn't go?

311
00:27:07.385 --> 00:27:10.833
Goodness, no.
Far too much work to do down here.

312
00:27:20.412 --> 00:27:23.511
Vidia was right. Being a tinker stinks.

313
00:27:24.348 --> 00:27:26.072
Excuse me?

314
00:27:26.812 --> 00:27:29.879
It's just, why don't we get to go
to the mainland?

315
00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:35.097
The mainland? Who gives
a pile of pebbles about the mainland?

316
00:27:35.774 --> 00:27:38.196
But, Fairy Mary,
the other fairies get to go.

317
00:27:38.302 --> 00:27:41.369
Now, Tinker Bell,
are you a garden fairy?

318
00:27:42.239 --> 00:27:43.383
Well, no.

319
00:27:43.486 --> 00:27:45.820
- Are you a light fairy?
- No.

320
00:27:45.918 --> 00:27:48.569
Animal fairy? Water fairy, perhaps?

321
00:27:48.669 --> 00:27:50.077
No and no.

322
00:27:50.174 --> 00:27:54.201
No. You're not. You are a tinker.
It's who you are.

323
00:27:54.624 --> 00:27:56.053
Be proud of it.

324
00:27:57.376 --> 00:28:00.223
The day you can
magically make the flowers grow,

325
00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.964
or capture the rays of the sun
and whatnot, then you can go.

326
00:28:04.321 --> 00:28:06.459
Until then, your work is here.

327
00:28:30.339 --> 00:28:32.413
Good idea, Fairy Mary.

328
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:44.227
Get your pixie dust yet?

329
00:28:44.292 --> 00:28:45.252
Just did.

330
00:28:45.316 --> 00:28:47.105
- Nice day for flying.
- Sure is.

331
00:28:47.204 --> 00:28:48.164
Here you go, Silvermist.

332
00:28:48.261 --> 00:28:49.919
Thank you, Terence.

333
00:28:51.525 --> 00:28:53.380
I hope Tinker Bell is okay.

334
00:28:53.478 --> 00:28:55.747
I know. That poor little sapling.

335
00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.525
She looked pretty wilted yesterday.

336
00:28:58.631 --> 00:29:00.899
Well, I wouldn't blame her
if she stayed in bed all day.

337
00:29:00.998 --> 00:29:02.460
Morning, girls!

338
00:29:02.567 --> 00:29:03.568
- Tinker Bell?
- Tinker Bell?

339
00:29:03.591 --> 00:29:07.334
Guess what? I've decided I'm not
gonna be a tinker fairy anymore.

340
00:29:07.432 --> 00:29:08.391
- What?
- What?

341
00:29:08.488 --> 00:29:11.522
Well, I was thinking.
Why do I have to be a tinker?

342
00:29:11.624 --> 00:29:14.080
Just 'cause
some silly hammer glowed?

343
00:29:14.184 --> 00:29:16.738
I mean, who's to say
it wasn't some big mistake?

344
00:29:16.841 --> 00:29:19.045
Maybe I can just switch my talent.

345
00:29:19.146 --> 00:29:22.407
Switch your talent?
I don't know, Tinker Bell...

346
00:29:22.505 --> 00:29:25.059
If you could teach me your talents,
any of them,

347
00:29:25.162 --> 00:29:27.912
maybe I could show the Queen
I can work with nature, too.

348
00:29:29.419 --> 00:29:31.754
And then she'd let me go
to the mainland for spring.

349
00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:34.916
Oh, Tinker Bell.
That's just not how it works.

350
00:29:35.018 --> 00:29:37.702
- Well, maybe she could.
- She's right. She could.

351
00:29:37.803 --> 00:29:40.421
Well, I've never heard of someone
switching talents before.

352
00:29:40.523 --> 00:29:42.378
She's right. Me, neither.

353
00:29:42.539 --> 00:29:48.770
Look. You all do things that are
beautiful and magical and important.

354
00:29:49.068 --> 00:29:52.363
But me, well,

355
00:29:52.461 --> 00:29:56.039
there's gotta be more to my life
than just pots and kettles.

356
00:29:56.877 --> 00:29:59.627
All I'm asking
is that you give me a chance.

357
00:30:01.358 --> 00:30:02.732
I'll help you, Tinker Bell.

358
00:30:02.829 --> 00:30:04.422
Thank you, Sil.

359
00:30:04.526 --> 00:30:06.315
Me, too. Could be fun.

360
00:30:06.543 --> 00:30:10.317
Well, first time for everything, I guess.
What harm can come from trying?

361
00:30:10.415 --> 00:30:12.967
Well, I still think this is a bad idea.

362
00:30:15.504 --> 00:30:17.959
So, for your first day
of water fairy training,

363
00:30:18.064 --> 00:30:20.170
I could show you
how to make ripples in the pond.

364
00:30:20.272 --> 00:30:21.286
Okay!

365
00:30:21.392 --> 00:30:24.075
Or teach you how to talk
to the babbling brook.

366
00:30:24.176 --> 00:30:25.835
Oh, that sounds fun, too.

367
00:30:25.937 --> 00:30:29.035
Or wait, wait, wait.
I got it, I got it, I got it!

368
00:30:29.616 --> 00:30:32.202
Dewdrops on spider webs!

369
00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.924
Come on. I'll show you how to do it.

370
00:30:35.024 --> 00:30:37.294
- Good luck, Tink!
- You can do it!

371
00:30:38.834 --> 00:30:39.849
Oh, um...

372
00:30:39.954 --> 00:30:41.383
Go get 'em.

373
00:30:43.762 --> 00:30:49.392
Just cup your hands like this,
reach into the water, and...

374
00:30:50.067 --> 00:30:52.173
Okay, you've heard of a dewdrop?

375
00:30:52.276 --> 00:30:56.050
This is a don't drop.
That's water fairy humor.

376
00:30:57.076 --> 00:30:58.385
It's good.

377
00:30:58.965 --> 00:30:59.924
Come on.

378
00:30:59.988 --> 00:31:02.705
Okay, Tink, now,
this next part can be a little tricky.

379
00:31:02.805 --> 00:31:05.456
It takes a very steady,
delicate hand to...

380
00:31:08.245 --> 00:31:10.001
Where's your dewdrop?

381
00:31:10.262 --> 00:31:11.220
Oh.

382
00:31:12.629 --> 00:31:14.289
Forgot my dewdrop.

383
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:19.314
Hey! I did

384
00:31:20.215 --> 00:31:21.175
it.

385
00:31:21.271 --> 00:31:24.532
Shake that one off. Shake it off.
You can do this!

386
00:31:27.607 --> 00:31:30.805
That's it. That's it, Tink.
You're doing it! You're...

387
00:31:32.376 --> 00:31:34.066
Now, Tink, try to...

388
00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.459
No, no, sweetie, you need to...
Well, maybe if you...

389
00:31:38.616 --> 00:31:41.235
Well, you have to admire
her persistence.

390
00:31:41.497 --> 00:31:42.479
Tinker Bell!

391
00:31:42.585 --> 00:31:44.789
Although, sometimes hammers glow

392
00:31:45.433 --> 00:31:46.808
for a reason.

393
00:31:52.379 --> 00:31:53.426
Whoa.

394
00:32:05.501 --> 00:32:09.756
You know, you always struck me
as a light fairy kind of gal.

395
00:32:21.245 --> 00:32:23.733
<i>Here we go in the treasure...</i>

396
00:32:27.549 --> 00:32:29.468
- Have you seen Tink?
- No, thank you. Not thirsty!

397
00:32:31.646 --> 00:32:33.534
No, no. Not "drink," Tink!

398
00:32:33.855 --> 00:32:36.408
Pink? I like purple meself!

399
00:32:36.511 --> 00:32:39.130
Tink! Have you seen Tink?

400
00:32:39.231 --> 00:32:40.311
What?

401
00:32:40.864 --> 00:32:43.798
I do not stink! Maybe it's you, eh?

402
00:32:45.825 --> 00:32:47.712
Hey, have you seen Tink?

403
00:32:49.953 --> 00:32:53.302
- Fairy Mary's gonna be cross.
- Aye, Clank.

404
00:32:53.409 --> 00:32:55.598
We'd better take some of this
off Miss Bell's plate, so...

405
00:32:55.649 --> 00:32:58.007
- All right, then.
- No, no, no! Wait, wait, Clank!

406
00:33:03.523 --> 00:33:06.426
What are...
Will you two stop mucking about?

407
00:33:06.531 --> 00:33:09.663
- What Clank did was, he took it off...
- Bobble told me that I should...

408
00:33:09.763 --> 00:33:13.560
I see Tinker Bell has
got her work done, mysteriously.

409
00:33:14.147 --> 00:33:15.489
Where is she, anyway?

410
00:33:16.644 --> 00:33:19.099
Well, you see, she's...

411
00:33:19.492 --> 00:33:21.402
She went with Cheese to...

412
00:33:22.852 --> 00:33:25.721
No, no. Clank means
she went to get cheese, you see,

413
00:33:25.829 --> 00:33:28.699
- the food, for Cheese the mouse...
- Yes, the food, for Cheese the mouse.

414
00:33:28.805 --> 00:33:31.325
...because he was whining.

415
00:33:31.429 --> 00:33:32.388
Yeah. Like a baby.

416
00:33:32.485 --> 00:33:35.071
Like a wittle, wee baby, there.

417
00:33:47.143 --> 00:33:51.334
Okay, what can I teach you that's
gonna do the least amount of damage?

418
00:33:53.768 --> 00:33:56.189
Oh, I know. Follow me, Tinker Bell.

419
00:34:01.449 --> 00:34:05.475
The last light of day,
it's the richest kind of all!

420
00:34:05.578 --> 00:34:09.287
Wait for it. Wait for it.

421
00:34:09.385 --> 00:34:11.174
Okay, and now!

422
00:34:11.273 --> 00:34:13.063
Oh, wow.

423
00:34:15.337 --> 00:34:16.385
Huh?

424
00:34:18.346 --> 00:34:19.623
It's incredible.

425
00:34:19.723 --> 00:34:21.480
Now for the fun part.

426
00:34:22.347 --> 00:34:25.960
- Do you think it's heavy?
- No. It's light.

427
00:34:37.197 --> 00:34:38.506
Okay, okay.

428
00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.535
Stay.

429
00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:13.543
- Here, Tink. Let me...
- No! I almost got it.

430
00:35:13.648 --> 00:35:15.274
If I just get you started...

431
00:35:15.377 --> 00:35:17.232
This is impossible!

432
00:35:20.498 --> 00:35:21.708
Look out!

433
00:35:27.666 --> 00:35:28.877
Oh, no.

434
00:35:29.555 --> 00:35:31.214
Whoa!

435
00:35:34.356 --> 00:35:36.244
I wonder how it's going.

436
00:35:37.076 --> 00:35:38.864
Fly, Tink, fly!

437
00:35:39.508 --> 00:35:40.621
Uh-oh.

438
00:35:42.004 --> 00:35:43.019
We'll save you, Tink!

439
00:35:43.125 --> 00:35:45.012
Bob and weave!
Bob and weave!

440
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:47.248
Cover your tushy!

441
00:35:59.702 --> 00:36:01.938
- We fiddle and fix.
- Craft and create.

442
00:36:02.038 --> 00:36:04.079
- Carve acorn buckets.
- To hold flower paint.

443
00:36:04.182 --> 00:36:06.638
- Preparing for spring.
- We do all this and more.

444
00:36:06.743 --> 00:36:10.355
- Yes, being a tinker is never a bore!
- Yes, being a tinker is never a bore!

445
00:36:12.696 --> 00:36:14.834
Tinker Bell,
I'd like a word with you.

446
00:36:14.937 --> 00:36:16.245
Fairy Mary!

447
00:36:16.888 --> 00:36:21.395
See, I was on my deliveries,
and it's actually kind of...

448
00:36:21.497 --> 00:36:24.629
Save it.
I know what you've been up to, missy.

449
00:36:26.362 --> 00:36:29.145
And I had such high hopes for you.

450
00:36:40.027 --> 00:36:41.937
- You'd do well to listen to her...
- Why?

451
00:36:42.043 --> 00:36:43.898
So I can do this my whole life?

452
00:36:43.996 --> 00:36:46.899
I don't wanna be just a stupid tinker!

453
00:36:49.244 --> 00:36:52.026
No, no, not that you guys are...

454
00:36:53.436 --> 00:36:56.982
I didn't mean that... Guys, I wasn't...

455
00:36:59.164 --> 00:37:00.571
I have to go.

456
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:19.101
Now, flap them. Flap them.
That's it! Have fun!

457
00:37:23.808 --> 00:37:25.564
Hey, Tink! You ready?

458
00:37:25.985 --> 00:37:27.578
A little nervous, actually.

459
00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.234
Oh, don't be silly.
Come on, you'll be fine.

460
00:37:30.337 --> 00:37:32.956
We're teaching baby birds
how to fly.

461
00:37:33.665 --> 00:37:36.186
First, you have to get their attention.

462
00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:39.040
Smile and establish trust.

463
00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:45.216
See? Okay, open your wings, honey,
and flap them up and down.

464
00:37:45.507 --> 00:37:49.401
Up and down. That's the way.
Faster, faster.

465
00:37:49.507 --> 00:37:53.248
That's right. Yes! You're doing it! Okay.
Come out this way a little bit.

466
00:37:54.211 --> 00:37:58.969
You're okay. You're okay. You got it.
Keep flapping, keep flapping!

467
00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.923
Hey, why don't you help
that last little guy?

468
00:38:06.692 --> 00:38:11.035
Okay, okay.
Just smile and establish trust.

469
00:38:11.462 --> 00:38:12.739
Hi, there!

470
00:38:13.574 --> 00:38:17.371
Hey, little fella,
you wanna do some flap-flap today?

471
00:38:18.854 --> 00:38:20.796
Oh, sure you do!

472
00:38:20.902 --> 00:38:24.613
All you do is,
you just flap your wings, like this.

473
00:38:27.176 --> 00:38:30.307
No, no, no. None of that.
Come on. All we got to do is...

474
00:38:30.408 --> 00:38:31.367
Ow!

475
00:38:33.608 --> 00:38:35.877
Look. I'm going to level with you, okay?

476
00:38:35.977 --> 00:38:39.458
I kind of bombed out on
the whole water and light fairy things,

477
00:38:39.561 --> 00:38:41.830
and I'm starting to
run out of options here.

478
00:38:41.929 --> 00:38:44.350
If you could see fit
to flap your little wings

479
00:38:44.457 --> 00:38:46.726
and take flight
for a few measly seconds,

480
00:38:46.825 --> 00:38:50.087
I might be able to go to the mainland
and bring happiness to the world!

481
00:38:50.186 --> 00:38:52.040
What do you say?

482
00:38:52.873 --> 00:38:54.280
Wrong answer.

483
00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:58.312
If I end up making acorn kettles
for the rest of my life,

484
00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:00.321
I am holding you
personally responsible.

485
00:39:01.995 --> 00:39:03.817
Hey, hey. Look at this!

486
00:39:04.012 --> 00:39:08.802
Okay, just stop squirming.
Would you just... Hey!

487
00:39:09.483 --> 00:39:12.932
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm letting go. I am letting go.

488
00:39:17.516 --> 00:39:19.207
This is not working.

489
00:39:21.806 --> 00:39:25.123
Hey, maybe that guy can help.
He's a really good flyer.

490
00:39:26.574 --> 00:39:27.981
Hey, up there!

491
00:39:31.374 --> 00:39:32.422
Hawk!

492
00:39:42.864 --> 00:39:44.172
- What's happening?
- Quick, hide!

493
00:39:44.272 --> 00:39:45.482
Look out!

494
00:39:50.992 --> 00:39:53.294
A hawk! Tinker Bell's in trouble!

495
00:40:06.931 --> 00:40:08.142
- Hey!
- Vidia?

496
00:40:08.243 --> 00:40:10.065
This is my hiding spot!

497
00:40:12.084 --> 00:40:13.906
But it's all yours, now.

498
00:40:16.532 --> 00:40:17.515
No!

499
00:40:27.989 --> 00:40:31.022
- Get him!
- Get him!

500
00:40:36.245 --> 00:40:38.701
- What?
- You all right?

501
00:40:40.278 --> 00:40:41.391
So scary.

502
00:40:48.663 --> 00:40:50.354
Are you okay, Vidia?

503
00:40:53.625 --> 00:40:55.664
- Let me help you.
- Don't touch me! I'm fine!

504
00:40:55.768 --> 00:40:58.899
- But I was only trying to help.
- Well, stop trying.

505
00:41:03.545 --> 00:41:04.974
Tinker Bell...

506
00:41:06.425 --> 00:41:08.914
I can't hold water. I can't hold light.

507
00:41:09.018 --> 00:41:12.596
Birds hate me. I'm just so useless!

508
00:41:12.698 --> 00:41:13.843
Tink.

509
00:41:26.267 --> 00:41:29.050
Great.
I failed for the third time in a row.

510
00:41:30.011 --> 00:41:34.583
At this rate, I should get to
the mainland right about... Oh... Never!

511
00:41:36.701 --> 00:41:37.659
Huh?

512
00:42:29.219 --> 00:42:30.233
Yes!

513
00:42:38.916 --> 00:42:39.930
Sil!

514
00:43:23.241 --> 00:43:24.484
Beautiful.

515
00:43:52.044 --> 00:43:53.451
- You fixed it!
- Wow!

516
00:43:53.612 --> 00:43:55.369
- Beautiful!
- Amazing!

517
00:43:55.469 --> 00:43:56.502
What are you guys doing here?

518
00:43:56.525 --> 00:43:59.275
It might be
the sparkliest thing I've ever seen,

519
00:43:59.374 --> 00:44:00.836
and I've seen a lot of sparkly things!

520
00:44:00.942 --> 00:44:05.099
It's a really pretty thingy. What is it?

521
00:44:05.422 --> 00:44:07.048
I don't know. I just found it.

522
00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:11.372
Tinker Bell, don't you even realize
what you're doing? You're tinkering!

523
00:44:11.663 --> 00:44:14.958
What? No, no, this isn't... I was just...

524
00:44:15.247 --> 00:44:19.241
Creating those gadgets,
figuring things out, fixing stuff like this,

525
00:44:19.535 --> 00:44:21.226
that's what tinkering is, sweetie!

526
00:44:21.326 --> 00:44:24.644
Don't you like doing this?
Isn't it what you really love?

527
00:44:24.751 --> 00:44:27.173
Yeah! Who cares about
going to the mainland, anyway?

528
00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:29.516
Well, I do, remember?

529
00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.298
I want to see
where these things come from.

530
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.637
Why are you saying this?
Are you just giving up on me?

531
00:44:34.737 --> 00:44:38.087
I mean, aren't you going to teach me
to be a garden fairy anymore?

532
00:44:38.193 --> 00:44:40.779
Sweet pea, I think this is your talent.

533
00:44:41.362 --> 00:44:43.500
Tink, we just want you to be happy.

534
00:44:43.602 --> 00:44:46.417
If you really want me to be happy,
you'll help me get to the mainland

535
00:44:46.515 --> 00:44:48.108
like you promised.

536
00:44:49.363 --> 00:44:52.429
Please, Tinker Bell, just think about it.

537
00:45:29.272 --> 00:45:32.239
Will you teach me how to be
a fast-flying fairy?

538
00:45:34.551 --> 00:45:36.657
Please? I know I could do it!

539
00:45:36.792 --> 00:45:40.371
With your help, I could be flying
as fast as you in no time.

540
00:45:40.601 --> 00:45:44.595
Vidia, you're my last hope.
All my friends have given up on me.

541
00:45:46.042 --> 00:45:49.620
Rosetta won't even try to teach me
to be a garden fairy now.

542
00:45:50.042 --> 00:45:54.615
I bet I could at least paint some flowers
or plant some sproutlings.

543
00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:57.848
I mean,
there must be something I could do.

544
00:46:00.507 --> 00:46:03.856
Or if you really want to be
a garden fairy...

545
00:46:14.268 --> 00:46:16.473
Capture the sprinting thistles.

546
00:46:17.533 --> 00:46:21.494
Well, okay. I can do this. Yeah!

547
00:46:23.582 --> 00:46:25.273
Okay. Ready, Cheese?

548
00:46:27.934 --> 00:46:29.974
Come on. They're just weeds.

549
00:46:32.318 --> 00:46:35.865
Besides, there were only
seven or eight at the most, right?

550
00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:41.528
Hyah!

551
00:46:46.112 --> 00:46:50.368
We can do this. I know we can do this.
What do you say?

552
00:46:54.145 --> 00:46:55.323
Attaboy.

553
00:47:05.378 --> 00:47:07.167
This ought to be good.

554
00:47:19.044 --> 00:47:20.090
Hey!

555
00:47:20.197 --> 00:47:22.651
Come on, you!
Oh, come on!

556
00:47:23.269 --> 00:47:27.644
Just a bit this way!
It's working! It's working!

557
00:47:35.399 --> 00:47:36.576
Come on!

558
00:47:43.784 --> 00:47:46.599
Wait, wait, wait.
Come back! Come back!

559
00:47:48.806 --> 00:47:54.436
These things just won't listen!
Come on, Cheese. Go, go, go!

560
00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:02.342
Okay, definitely more than eight.

561
00:48:04.136 --> 00:48:07.170
Please file into the corral
in an orderly manner!

562
00:48:10.024 --> 00:48:11.072
Wait!

563
00:48:13.706 --> 00:48:15.495
Oh, no! Come on!

564
00:48:21.388 --> 00:48:22.795
Come on, now.

565
00:48:32.012 --> 00:48:34.695
Sorry. Sorry.
Excuse me. So sorry.

566
00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:36.683
This is the last batch.

567
00:48:40.686 --> 00:48:41.896
Look out!

568
00:48:42.286 --> 00:48:43.845
Sorry. Sorry!

569
00:49:35.443 --> 00:49:36.589
Oh, no.

570
00:49:36.756 --> 00:49:38.315
Tink. What happened?

571
00:49:38.419 --> 00:49:39.761
- I...
- Tinker Bell,

572
00:49:39.859 --> 00:49:41.201
what did you think you were doing?

573
00:49:41.299 --> 00:49:43.721
I was just... I was just trying to...

574
00:49:43.827 --> 00:49:45.770
I thought if I could capture
the thistles, then...

575
00:49:45.877 --> 00:49:49.390
There isn't a garden fairy alive
who can control those weeds!

576
00:49:49.492 --> 00:49:52.078
- What were you trying to prove?
- I...

577
00:49:52.181 --> 00:49:54.996
She's right, Tink.
This has all gone too far.

578
00:49:58.773 --> 00:50:00.683
By the second star!

579
00:50:03.350 --> 00:50:06.417
All the preparations for spring...
How did this...

580
00:50:14.487 --> 00:50:19.278
Queen Clarion, it was me.

581
00:50:20.056 --> 00:50:22.326
I did it. It was all my fault.

582
00:50:23.289 --> 00:50:24.631
Tinker Bell.

583
00:50:25.785 --> 00:50:27.192
I...

584
00:50:28.153 --> 00:50:29.430
I'm sorry.

585
00:50:44.379 --> 00:50:46.714
I don't think we can
fix this in time.

586
00:50:46.812 --> 00:50:49.747
We're going to have to cancel spring,
or postpone it at the very least.

587
00:50:49.852 --> 00:50:52.023
What, and put my
snowflake fairies back to work? Oh, no.

588
00:50:52.124 --> 00:50:53.652
But we can't! We can't do that!

589
00:50:53.756 --> 00:50:54.868
If the snow isn't melted,

590
00:50:54.972 --> 00:50:57.061
the seedlings won't grow,
the fruit won't ripen in the summer...

591
00:50:57.084 --> 00:50:59.386
And in the autumn,
there will be nothing to harvest.

592
00:50:59.485 --> 00:51:00.794
Spring must happen on time,

593
00:51:00.893 --> 00:51:02.551
or the balance of nature
will be undone!

594
00:51:02.653 --> 00:51:05.620
There must be something we can do!
Certainly this has happened before!

595
00:51:05.725 --> 00:51:07.864
It has!
Did you ever hear of the Ice Age?

596
00:51:07.966 --> 00:51:09.853
Settle down, all of you.

597
00:51:10.623 --> 00:51:14.879
Fairy Mary, is it even possible to redo
everything in such a short time?

598
00:51:20.735 --> 00:51:23.037
- No.
- Oh, no.

599
00:51:23.136 --> 00:51:25.558
We were so close,
and now it's all gone.

600
00:51:25.665 --> 00:51:27.289
Who's going to paint
our leaves now?

601
00:51:27.392 --> 00:51:28.985
The apples and pumpkins
will never grow.

602
00:51:29.087 --> 00:51:30.998
No rolling hills
covered in daffodils?

603
00:51:31.104 --> 00:51:33.079
And it took months to harvest
all those seeds!

604
00:51:33.184 --> 00:51:34.559
Animals waking
from hibernation

605
00:51:34.656 --> 00:51:36.545
will have nothing to eat!

606
00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:04.602
You okay, Tink?

607
00:52:05.701 --> 00:52:07.708
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

608
00:52:08.645 --> 00:52:13.402
I just came hoping to get a quick refill.
I'm going away for a while.

609
00:52:14.182 --> 00:52:15.141
Oh.

610
00:52:15.559 --> 00:52:19.487
- Well, how long you going to be gone?
- Well, actually, forever.

611
00:52:21.255 --> 00:52:22.912
Forever? Well,

612
00:52:24.486 --> 00:52:27.040
in that case,
a double scoop.

613
00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:30.143
Forever's a pretty long time, so I hear.

614
00:52:30.247 --> 00:52:31.676
Thanks, Terence.

615
00:52:31.782 --> 00:52:33.343
You know my name?

616
00:52:33.447 --> 00:52:35.716
Well, sure. Why wouldn't I?

617
00:52:36.039 --> 00:52:38.658
I don't know.
I'm just a dust-keeper guy.

618
00:52:39.592 --> 00:52:42.560
I'm not exactly seen as the most
important fairy in Pixie Hollow.

619
00:52:42.664 --> 00:52:44.487
Terence, what are you talking about?

620
00:52:44.585 --> 00:52:46.919
You're probably the most important one
there is!

621
00:52:47.017 --> 00:52:49.221
Without you,
no one would have any magic!

622
00:52:49.321 --> 00:52:51.907
Why, your talent makes you
who you are!

623
00:52:52.426 --> 00:52:55.208
- You should be proud of it! I mean...
- I am.

624
00:53:03.627 --> 00:53:06.377
I'd better get going.

625
00:53:42.127 --> 00:53:43.469
Hey, Cheese.

626
00:53:45.712 --> 00:53:48.330
"Be proud of your talent." What talent?

627
00:53:48.816 --> 00:53:51.751
I couldn't even get
these silly things to work.

628
00:54:04.434 --> 00:54:05.776
Lost things.

629
00:54:20.595 --> 00:54:21.872
That's it!

630
00:54:30.996 --> 00:54:32.688
Attention, everyone!

631
00:54:34.325 --> 00:54:36.715
I'm afraid I have distressing news.

632
00:54:38.262 --> 00:54:40.945
There is no way spring
can come on time.

633
00:54:41.782 --> 00:54:43.987
Months of work was lost,

634
00:54:44.086 --> 00:54:46.542
and it will take us months
to restore it all.

635
00:54:47.255 --> 00:54:49.776
So when the Everblossom
opens tomorrow,

636
00:54:50.136 --> 00:54:53.682
I'm afraid we will not be going
to the mainland for spring.

637
00:54:55.703 --> 00:54:58.551
Wait! I know how we can fix everything!

638
00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:01.302
Tinker Bell?

639
00:55:03.865 --> 00:55:05.720
Tinker Bell, I don't think this is...

640
00:55:05.818 --> 00:55:08.632
Just hear me out. Please.

641
00:55:09.721 --> 00:55:10.736
You!

642
00:55:13.913 --> 00:55:16.499
How long does it take you
to paint a ladybug?

643
00:55:16.602 --> 00:55:19.384
I don't know. 10, 15 minutes, I guess.

644
00:55:36.413 --> 00:55:40.025
See? We can build more.
I can show you how.

645
00:55:40.124 --> 00:55:43.671
Making paint, gathering seeds,
we can do it all in no time.

646
00:55:44.221 --> 00:55:46.109
We have to at least try!

647
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:49.845
Wait a...
Are we really gonna listen to her?

648
00:55:50.110 --> 00:55:52.566
She's the reason we're in this mess
in the first place!

649
00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:54.427
But I can fix it.

650
00:55:54.527 --> 00:55:58.935
Yippee! Tinker Bell's going to save us
with her dopey little doohickeys.

651
00:55:59.423 --> 00:56:02.488
- Hide the squirrels!
- What is your problem, Vidia?

652
00:56:02.622 --> 00:56:04.360
Why do you think
you're so much better than me?

653
00:56:04.383 --> 00:56:07.700
I am better than you, sweetie.
I didn't ruin spring.

654
00:56:07.807 --> 00:56:09.815
At least now I'm trying to help.

655
00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:12.254
Have you ever helped anyone
besides yourself?

656
00:56:12.352 --> 00:56:14.076
Well, I tried to help you!

657
00:56:14.176 --> 00:56:15.998
Maybe I should have told you
to capture the hawk

658
00:56:16.096 --> 00:56:17.952
instead of the thistles!

659
00:56:25.339 --> 00:56:28.339
Perhaps Tinker Bell was not
the only one responsible.

660
00:56:30.299 --> 00:56:33.846
It seems to me that
your fast-flying talent is well-suited

661
00:56:33.948 --> 00:56:37.210
to chasing down each and every one
of the thistles.

662
00:56:37.533 --> 00:56:38.514
Me?

663
00:56:38.749 --> 00:56:42.164
Yes. And I expect them all
to be returned to Needlepoint Meadow

664
00:56:42.269 --> 00:56:43.228
as soon as possible.

665
00:56:43.325 --> 00:56:45.628
But that could take forever!

666
00:56:45.726 --> 00:56:47.930
Then I suggest you get started.

667
00:56:57.247 --> 00:57:01.502
Now, Tinker Bell,
are you sure you can do this?

668
00:57:04.384 --> 00:57:05.399
Yes.

669
00:57:06.688 --> 00:57:10.168
Because I'm a tinker. It's who I am.

670
00:57:12.097 --> 00:57:13.919
And tinkers fix things.

671
00:57:15.457 --> 00:57:17.344
But I can't do it alone.

672
00:57:20.673 --> 00:57:22.462
Command us, Miss Bell.

673
00:57:23.170 --> 00:57:25.080
- I'll help.
- Show us how, Tink!

674
00:57:25.186 --> 00:57:27.073
- I'll help you.
- Me, too!

675
00:57:27.331 --> 00:57:32.798
Okay, gather up all the twigs you can,
all different sizes, and tree sap.

676
00:57:32.899 --> 00:57:36.128
We need lots of that.
But most importantly,

677
00:57:36.228 --> 00:57:39.610
we need to find lost things.

678
00:57:48.038 --> 00:57:49.663
Okay, what have you got?

679
00:57:49.766 --> 00:57:51.674
- How about this?
- Will this do?

680
00:57:51.781 --> 00:57:53.789
Can you use this fuzzy thing,
Miss Bell?

681
00:57:53.893 --> 00:57:55.202
- Oh, yeah!
- It's not fuzzy.

682
00:57:55.301 --> 00:57:57.635
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

683
00:58:00.806 --> 00:58:01.984
Twig.

684
00:58:02.086 --> 00:58:03.613
Hammer.

685
00:58:03.719 --> 00:58:06.469
Magnification, please. Thank you.

686
00:58:08.582 --> 00:58:10.470
And that's how you do it!

687
00:58:12.583 --> 00:58:14.755
Now, what do you suppose the...

688
00:58:25.546 --> 00:58:27.073
You smell funny.

689
00:58:28.682 --> 00:58:29.642
Oh!

690
00:58:31.594 --> 00:58:33.896
- I saw it first.
- I bumped into it.

691
00:58:34.698 --> 00:58:36.608
Just tie this off here.

692
00:58:37.034 --> 00:58:41.541
So, you just squeeze this,
then let it go, and...

693
00:58:42.795 --> 00:58:44.486
See? Simple!

694
00:58:47.371 --> 00:58:48.549
Now, just put the berries in,

695
00:58:48.651 --> 00:58:50.626
and we'll have plenty of paint
in no time!

696
00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:28.622
Six, seven and eight.

697
01:00:22.742 --> 01:00:26.092
You did it, Tinker Bell.
You saved spring.

698
01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:28.757
We all did it.

699
01:00:28.855 --> 01:00:31.889
Queen Clarion? Can't Tink
come with us to the mainland?

700
01:00:31.992 --> 01:00:34.893
Yeah, she's done so much
for everyone.

701
01:00:35.159 --> 01:00:38.421
No, no, you guys, really.
I don't need to go.

702
01:00:39.159 --> 01:00:41.069
Buttercup, it's what you wanted.

703
01:00:41.176 --> 01:00:43.632
It's okay. My work is here.

704
01:00:43.736 --> 01:00:45.624
And I still have so much to do. I gotta...

705
01:00:45.721 --> 01:00:47.412
Not here, you don't!

706
01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:49.268
Well... But I don't...

707
01:00:51.226 --> 01:00:52.470
Surprise, Miss Bell.

708
01:00:52.570 --> 01:00:55.417
We found your tiny dancer!

709
01:00:56.922 --> 01:01:00.086
Actually, I ran across this myself
many seasons ago.

710
01:01:00.667 --> 01:01:03.799
I didn't have a clue what it was
or how to fix it.

711
01:01:04.474 --> 01:01:09.461
But you did, Tinker Bell.
You are quite a rare talent indeed.

712
01:01:10.492 --> 01:01:14.452
And I'd imagine there's a little girl
out there who's missing this.

713
01:01:15.165 --> 01:01:17.052
What do you mean? How...

714
01:01:17.149 --> 01:01:19.702
I think that perhaps
a certain tinker fairy

715
01:01:19.805 --> 01:01:22.227
might have a job to do after all,

716
01:01:22.333 --> 01:01:23.577
on the mainland.

717
01:01:23.677 --> 01:01:25.139
You mean, I...

718
01:01:28.734 --> 01:01:30.055
- I knew you'd get to go!
- Oh, Tink!

719
01:01:30.078 --> 01:01:32.052
- We can help, Miss Bell.
- We can help. I'm strong.

720
01:01:32.158 --> 01:01:35.258
I'm so happy for you.
Come on. We gotta go line up.

721
01:01:36.286 --> 01:01:38.174
Thank you, Your Highness.

722
01:01:38.271 --> 01:01:40.638
But how will I find who it belongs to?

723
01:01:40.735 --> 01:01:42.558
You'll know. Now go!

724
01:01:50.367 --> 01:01:51.775
Good heavens.

725
01:01:52.544 --> 01:01:53.788
Thank you.

726
01:01:59.138 --> 01:02:02.171
Tink. Hey,
something to help you on the mainland.

727
01:02:04.321 --> 01:02:06.232
Terence, that's so sweet.

728
01:02:08.739 --> 01:02:10.266
Good luck, Tink.

729
01:02:10.659 --> 01:02:14.457
To the air, fairies! To the air!
The mainland awaits!

730
01:02:16.068 --> 01:02:20.770
<i>Come away
with me now to the sky</i>

731
01:02:20.868 --> 01:02:24.610
<i>Up o'er the hills and the sea</i>

732
01:02:24.708 --> 01:02:28.931
<i>Far beyond where our memories lie</i>

733
01:02:29.028 --> 01:02:33.152
<i>To a place where I'm free to be me</i>

734
01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:39.107
<i>Oh gather ye now one and all</i>

735
01:02:39.206 --> 01:02:43.713
<i>No matter what all ye may do</i>

736
01:02:43.815 --> 01:02:48.387
<i>Let the stars fill your soul
when the moon cradles all</i>

737
01:02:48.486 --> 01:02:53.190
<i>So to yourself be true</i>

738
01:02:54.535 --> 01:02:59.108
<i>The blanket of snow is all gone</i>

739
01:02:59.208 --> 01:03:02.919
<i>Each flower waits for the sun</i>

740
01:03:03.017 --> 01:03:07.295
<i>And the whispering tears of the rain</i>

741
01:03:07.401 --> 01:03:11.657
<i>Holds promise for everyone</i>

742
01:03:11.754 --> 01:03:15.432
<i>Then come away with me friends</i>

743
01:03:15.531 --> 01:03:19.840
<i>No matter where you call your home</i>

744
01:03:19.946 --> 01:03:23.559
<i>With a light in our hearts
We will never part</i>

745
01:03:23.659 --> 01:03:25.447
Fairies to the north!

746
01:03:25.930 --> 01:03:27.786
Fairies to the south!

747
01:03:27.947 --> 01:03:29.670
To the east and west!

748
01:03:40.109 --> 01:03:44.037
<i>Deep in the forest we go</i>

749
01:03:44.142 --> 01:03:45.418
<i>The creatures are all fast asleep</i>

750
01:03:45.517 --> 01:03:49.894
Wake up, sleepyheads!
Come on! There you go. Good squirrel.

751
01:03:49.998 --> 01:03:51.725
<i>With a kiss and a wink
we will waken our souls</i>

752
01:03:51.790 --> 01:03:55.238
<i>While always their safety we'll keep</i>

753
01:03:55.343 --> 01:03:58.987
<i>And then, then we'll dance
through the night</i>

754
01:03:59.118 --> 01:04:03.145
<i>Till the sunbeams sparkle at dawn</i>

755
01:04:03.248 --> 01:04:07.471
<i>And away we will go
Like last winter's snow</i>

756
01:04:07.568 --> 01:04:10.984
<i>Soon our work will be done</i>

757
01:04:11.089 --> 01:04:14.733
<i>Oh gather ye now one and all</i>

758
01:04:14.832 --> 01:04:18.629
<i>No matter what all ye may do</i>

759
01:04:18.736 --> 01:04:23.048
<i>Let the stars fill your soul
when the moon cradles all</i>

760
01:04:25.137 --> 01:04:29.164
<i>So to yourself be true</i>

761
01:04:42.067 --> 01:04:45.865
<i>Oh gather ye now one and all</i>

762
01:04:45.972 --> 01:04:49.835
<i>No matter what all ye may do</i>

763
01:04:49.941 --> 01:04:54.382
<i>Let the stars fill your soul
when the moon cradles all</i>

764
01:04:54.485 --> 01:04:58.709
<i>So to yourself be true</i>

765
01:05:05.079 --> 01:05:11.724
<i>So to yourself be true</i>

766
01:07:03.459 --> 01:07:05.598
Mummy! Guess what, guess what!

767
01:07:05.764 --> 01:07:08.001
Yes, Wendy.
What is it, darling?

768
01:07:14.372 --> 01:07:16.128
<i>A fairy's work is
much more than,</i>

769
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:17.244
<i>at first, it might appear.</i>

770
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:18.659
You did it!

771
01:07:19.525 --> 01:07:23.006
<i>Suppose your broken clock ticks,
though it hasn't in a year.</i>

772
01:07:24.166 --> 01:07:28.444
<i>Perchance you find a toy you lost,
or jingling bells you hear.</i>

773
01:07:31.175 --> 01:07:36.261
<i>It all means that
one very special fairy might be near.</i>

774
01:07:52.393 --> 01:07:56.420
<i>Watch all the flowers
dance with the wind</i>

775
01:07:56.522 --> 01:08:00.712
<i>Listen to snowflakes
whisper your name</i>

776
01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:04.193
<i>Feel all the wonder lifting your dreams</i>

777
01:08:04.298 --> 01:08:08.969
<i>You can fly</i>

778
01:08:09.068 --> 01:08:13.062
<i>Fly to who you are</i>

779
01:08:13.164 --> 01:08:17.059
<i>Climb upon your star</i>

780
01:08:17.165 --> 01:08:21.322
<i>You believe you'll find your wings</i>

781
01:08:21.422 --> 01:08:28.067
<i>Fly to your heart</i>

782
01:08:29.774 --> 01:08:33.636
<i>Touch every rainbow painting the sky</i>

783
01:08:33.742 --> 01:08:37.704
<i>Look at the magic glide
through your life</i>

784
01:08:37.806 --> 01:08:41.320
<i>A sprinkle of pixie dust circles the night</i>

785
01:08:41.424 --> 01:08:46.061
<i>You can fly</i>

786
01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:50.283
<i>Fly to who you are</i>

787
01:08:50.383 --> 01:08:54.246
<i>Climb upon your star</i>

788
01:08:54.352 --> 01:08:58.543
<i>When you believe
you'll find your wings</i>

789
01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:02.056
<i>Fly</i>

790
01:09:02.161 --> 01:09:06.090
<i>You can fly</i>

791
01:09:06.194 --> 01:09:10.221
<i>To your heart</i>

792
01:09:13.011 --> 01:09:18.925
<i>Rise to the heights of all you can be</i>

793
01:09:21.332 --> 01:09:27.312
<i>Soar on the hope of marvelous things</i>

794
01:09:27.413 --> 01:09:31.603
<i>Fly to who you are</i>

795
01:09:31.701 --> 01:09:35.596
<i>Climb upon your star</i>

796
01:09:35.702 --> 01:09:39.794
<i>When you believe
you'll find your wings</i>

797
01:09:39.894 --> 01:09:43.920
<i>Fly</i>

798
01:09:44.022 --> 01:09:47.951
<i>Everywhere you go</i>

799
01:09:48.054 --> 01:09:52.211
<i>Your soul will find a home</i>

800
01:09:52.311 --> 01:09:58.233
<i>You'll be free
to spread your wings</i>

801
01:09:58.424 --> 01:10:01.839
<i>Fly</i>

802
01:10:01.944 --> 01:10:08.623
<i>You can fly</i>

803
01:10:08.729 --> 01:10:12.886
<i>To your heart</i>
