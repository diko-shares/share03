Will you teach me how to be
a fast-flying fairy?

696
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.240
Please?
I know I could do it!

697
00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:32.080
With your help,
I could be flying
as fast as you in no time.

698
00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:34.800
Vidia,
you're my last hope.

699
00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:36.880
All my friends
have given up on me.

700
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.720
Rosetta won't even try
to teach me to be
a garden fairy now.

701
00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:46.960
I bet I could at least
paint some flowers
or plant some sproutlings.

702
00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:50.320
I mean, there must be
something I could do.

703
00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:56.600
Or if you really want
to be a garden fairy...

704
00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:00.880

the sprinting thistles.

706
00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:14.960
Well, okay.
I can do this.
Yeah!

707
00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:18.880
Okay. Ready, Cheese?

708
00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:23.840
Come on.
They're just weeds.

709
00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:29.960
Besides, there were only seven
or eight at the most, right?

710
00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:35.880
Hyah!

711
00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:45.080
We can do this.
I know we can do this.
What do you say?

712
00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:50.280
Attaboy.

713
00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.600
This ought to be good.

714
00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:16.080
Hey!

715
00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.760
TINKER BELL:
Come on, you!
Oh, come on!

716
00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:21.600
Just a bit this way!

717
00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:23.960
It's working!
It's working!

718
00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:33.280
Come on!

719
00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:40.640

720
00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:43.680
Wait, wait, wait.
Come back! Come back!

721
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.120
These things
just won't listen!

722
00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:52.640
Come on, Cheese. Go, go, go!

723
00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:00.120
Okay, definitely
more than eight.

724
00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:05.160
Please file into the corral
in an orderly manner!

725
00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:09.200
Wait!

726
00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:13.840
Oh, no! Come on!

727
00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:21.440
Come on, now.

TINKER BELL:
Sorry. Sorry.
Excuse me. So sorry.

730
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.920
This is the last batch.

00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:43.360
Sorry. Sorry!

734
00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:38.400
Oh, no.

735
00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:40.200
Tink. What happened?

736
00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:41.680
I...
Tinker Bell,

737
00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.200
what did you think
you were doing?

738
00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:45.800
I was just...
I was just trying to...

739
00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:47.920
I thought
if I could capture
the thistles, then...

740
00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:51.720
There isn't
a garden fairy alive who
can control those weeds!

741
00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:54.520
What were you
trying to prove?
I...

742
00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:57.560
She's right, Tink.
This has all
gone too far.

743
00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:03.480
By the second star!

744
00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:09.440
All the preparations
for spring... How did this...

745
00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:22.880
Queen Clarion, it was me.

746
00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:26.080
I did it.
It was all my fault.

747
00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:28.480
Tinker Bell.

748
00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:31.160
(WEEPING) I...

749
00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:33.480
I'm sorry.

750
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.520
SPRING: I don't think
we can fix this in time.

751
00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:53.160
We're going to
have to cancel spring,

752
00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:54.680
or postpone it
at the very least.

753
00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:57.000
WINTER: What, and put
my snowflake fairies
back to work? Oh, no.

754
00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:58.720
But we can't!
We can't do that!

755
00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:00.000
If the snow isn't melted,

756
00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:02.160
the seedlings won't grow,
the fruit won't ripen
in the summer...

757
00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:04.680
And in the autumn,
there will be
nothing to harvest.

758
00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:06.200
Spring must happen on time,

759
00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:08.000
or the balance of nature
will be undone!

760
00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:09.800
There must be
something we can do!

761
00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:11.200
Certainly this
has happened before!

762
00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:13.520
It has!
Did you ever hear
of the Ice Age?

763
00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:15.600
Settle down, all of you.

764
00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:17.400
Fairy Mary,

765
00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:20.880
is it even possible
to redo everything
in such a short time?

766
00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:29.360
No.
SPRING: Oh, no.

767
00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:32.000
We were so close,
and now it's all gone.

our leaves now?

will never grow.

SUMMER:
No rolling hills
covered in daffodils?

771
00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:39.840
SPRING: And it took months
to harvest all those seeds!

from hibernation

773
00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:43.440

You okay, Tink?

775
00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:15.920
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

776
00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:21.880
I just came hoping
to get a quick refill.
I'm going away for a while.

777
00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:23.640
Oh.

778
00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:25.600
Well, how long you
going to be gone?

779
00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:28.440
Well, actually, forever.

780
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.760
Forever? Well,

781
00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:36.120
(CHUCKLES)
in that case,
a double scoop.

782
00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:39.320
Forever's a pretty
long time, so I hear.

783
00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:40.960
Thanks, Terence.

784
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.640
You know my name?

785
00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:45.120
Well, sure.
Why wouldn't I?

786
00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:48.200
I don't know.
I'm just a dust-keeper guy.

787
00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:52.280
I'm not exactly seen
as the most important
fairy in Pixie Hollow.

Terence,
what are you
talking about?

789
00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:56.800
You're probably
the most important one
there is!

790
00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:59.200
Without you,
no one would have
any magic!

791
00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.000
Why, your talent
makes you who you are!

792
00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:03.960
You should be
proud of it! I mean...

793
00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:05.480
I am.

794
00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:17.120

Hey, Cheese.

796
00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:00.880
"Be proud of your talent."
What talent?

797
00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:04.400
I couldn't even get
these silly things
to work.

798
00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:19.040
Lost things.

799
00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:35.800
That's it!

Attention, everyone!

801
00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:51.280
I'm afraid I have
distressing news.

802
00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:55.720
There is no way spring
can come on time.

803
00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:58.880
Months of work was lost,

804
00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:01.560
and it will take us months
to restore it all.

805
00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:04.920
So when the Everblossom
opens tomorrow,

806
00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:08.960
I'm afraid
we will not be going
to the mainland for spring.

I don't think this is...

811

Just hear me out.
Please.

00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:26.800
You!

How long does it take you
to paint a ladybug?

10, 15 minutes,
I guess.

See? We can build more.
I can show you how.

Making paint, gathering seeds,
we can do it all in no time.

818
00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:03.640
We have to at least try!

00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:07.520
Wait a... Are we really
gonna listen to her?

820
00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:10.360
She's the reason
we're in this mess
in the first place!

you're so much
better than me?

better than you, sweetie.

I'm trying to help.

ever helped anyone

Well, I tried to help you!

830
00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:34.800
Maybe I should have told you
to capture the hawk

00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:36.840

was not the only
one responsible.

(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

835

your fast-flying talent
is well-suited

00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:01.960
Yes. And I expect
them all to be returned
to Needlepoint Meadow

as soon as possible.

take forever!

841
00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:07.960
Then I suggest
you get started.

842
00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:22.120
Now, Tinker Bell,
are you sure
you can do this?

843
00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:26.200
Yes.

844
00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:31.160
Because I'm a tinker.
It's who I am.

845
00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:35.080

Show us how, Tink!

and tree sap.

We need lots of that.
But most importantly,

we need to find lost things.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:12.320
Okay, what have you got?

855
01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.440
How about this?
Will this do?

856
01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.600
Can you use
this fuzzy thing,
Miss Bell?

857
01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.120
Oh, yeah!
It's not fuzzy.

I bumped into it.

TINKER BELL:
Just tie this off here.

869
01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:06.400
So, you just squeeze this,
then let it go, and...

870
01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:09.520
See? Simple!

871
01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.720
Now, just put
the berries in,

872
01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:15.880

of paint in no time!

You did it, Tinker Bell.
You saved spring.

877
01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:58.200
We all did it.

878
01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:01.440
Queen Clarion?
Can't Tink come with us
to the mainland?

879
01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:04.600
Yeah,
she's done so much
for everyone.

880
01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:08.280
No, no,
you guys, really.
I don't need to go.

881
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.040
Buttercup,
it's what you wanted.

882
01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:13.720
It's okay. My work is here.

883
01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:15.800
And I still have so
much to do. I gotta...

884
01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.640
FAIRY MARY:
Not here, you don't!

885
01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:19.600
Well... But I don't...

886
01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.920
Surprise, Miss Bell.

887
01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:25.960
We found your
tiny dancer!

888
01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:30.840
Actually,
I ran across this myself
many seasons ago.

889
01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:34.720
I didn't have
a clue what it was
or how to fix it.

890
01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.520
But you did,
Tinker Bell.

891
01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:40.480
You are quite
a rare talent indeed.

892
01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:45.840
And I'd imagine
there's a little girl
out there who's missing this.

893
01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:48.520
What do you mean? How...

894
01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:51.320
I think that perhaps
a certain tinker fairy

895
01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.960
might have a job
to do after all,

896
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.320
on the mainland.

you'd get to go!

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:04.160
We can help, Miss Bell.
We can help. I'm strong.

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:07.520
I'm so happy for you.
Come on.
We gotta go line up.

Thank you, Your Highness.

902
01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:13.160
But how will I find
who it belongs to?

903
01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:15.160
You'll know. Now go!

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:24.720

something to help you
on the mainland.

that's so sweet.
