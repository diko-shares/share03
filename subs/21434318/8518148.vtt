<i>Once you get to

36
00:01:57.494 --> 00:01:59.705
The notion that
people are idolizing

37
00:01:59.788 --> 00:02:02.124
{\an8}Jaycen 'Two-J's'
Jennings, it's ridiculous.

38
00:02:02.207 --> 00:02:03.417
{\an8}Jennings... And
he dropped it!

39
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.252
{\an8} <i>Has to make that play.</i>

40
00:02:05.335 --> 00:02:06.729
{\an8}And he went out there
and he didn't deliver,

41
00:02:06.753 --> 00:02:08.273
{\an8}and he hadn't delivered
the whole game.

42
00:02:08.505 --> 00:02:10.549
{\an8}<i>What's he call that
stupid dance? The Two-J's?</i>

43

{\an8}You're young, you're successful,

45
00:02:15.095 --> 00:02:16.263

{\an8}<i>He's chasing rings harder

48
00:02:21.018 --> 00:02:22.704
{\an8}<i>And you know what I say
about those housewives,</i>

49
00:02:22.728 --> 00:02:24.897
{\an8}<i>at least they stayed in one
city their whole career.</i>

50
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.481
{\an8}<i>Where's the loyalty?</i>

51
00:02:26.565 --> 00:02:28.275
{\an8}<i>But all that irrational-ass hate</i>

52
00:02:28.358 --> 00:02:30.277

valuable lesson.</i>

53
00:02:30.944 --> 00:02:33.363
{\an8}<i>Never, ever, ever</i>

That's bullshit.

114
00:05:08.935 --> 00:05:10.312
You're here now, so...

115
00:05:10.395 --> 00:05:11.563
Mothafucker, we had a plan.

116
00:05:11.646 --> 00:05:13.482
I create a dope-ass podcast,

117
00:05:13.565 --> 00:05:15.650
you get my dope ass
a commentary job,

118
00:05:16.109 --> 00:05:17.486
then I get back

119
00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:19.255
in the spotlight again.
Do you remember that?

120
00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:21.823
Yeah, of course, I remember
the motherfuckin' plan.

121
00:05:21.907 --> 00:05:25.368
But the problem with
the plan is that people

122
00:05:25.869 --> 00:05:27.537
say, for no good reason,

123
00:05:27.621 --> 00:05:29.623
that you're a selfish prick

124
00:05:29.706 --> 00:05:30.808
who's impossible to work with.

125
00:05:30.832 --> 00:05:32.667
- That's fucking bullshit!
- Well...

00:05:32.751 --> 00:05:33.919
Chip Collins.

127
00:05:34.002 --> 00:05:35.170
Don't they hate his ass?

128
00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:37.172
So, actually, yes.

129
00:05:37.255 --> 00:05:41.343
Chip Collins has a hate-love
ratio of 50-50. Okay?

130
00:05:41.426 --> 00:05:43.470
Yours is 95-5.

131
00:05:44.221 --> 00:05:46.932
Look, if I were you, I
would do some charity work.

132
00:05:47.015 --> 00:05:50.143
Get some positive PR for
your brand, maybe, uh...

133
00:05:50.227 --> 00:05:51.579
Why don't you start a
school for poor kids

134
00:05:51.603 --> 00:05:52.938
like LeBron, huh?

135
00:05:53.021 --> 00:05:55.524
Fuck LeBron James,
and fuck poor kids.

136
00:05:55.607 --> 00:05:57.442
You just need to do
your mothafuckin' job

137
00:05:57.526 --> 00:05:58.693
and get me back in the game.

138
00:05:58.777 --> 00:06:00.362
Man, if I were you, I would

139
00:06:00.445 --> 00:06:02.131
reconsider the <i>Dancing

140
00:06:02.155 --> 00:06:03.674
- that's a really good deal...
- Man, fuck you,

lookin' motherfucker!

142
00:06:05.367 --> 00:06:10.122

143
00:06:10.205 --> 00:06:11.498

Aladdin-looking mothafucker!

You know who the fuck I
am? I'm Jaycen Jennings.

146
00:06:16.503 --> 00:06:20.340
Well known, highly respected,
top-five receiver of all time.

147
00:06:21.133 --> 00:06:22.509
- Okay.
- Okay.

148
00:06:22.592 --> 00:06:23.986
So, go get my
mothafuckin' car, then.

149
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.263
Hey, hey, Two-J's, why
don't you just relax, man.

150
00:06:26.346 --> 00:06:27.740
The guy's just
trying to do his job.

151
00:06:27.764 --> 00:06:29.182

Acting like you don't

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.501
- Don't worry about
him. Fuck you, Gonzalez!

158
00:06:38.525 --> 00:06:39.901

159

160
00:06:45.073 --> 00:06:47.159

00:07:14.644 --> 00:07:16.980
{\an8}Put your phone away so that
we can begin sentencing.

172
00:07:17.063 --> 00:07:18.440
Oh, for sure, my bad.

173
00:07:18.815 --> 00:07:21.902
Mr. Jennings, you've plead
guilty to charges of speeding,

174
00:07:21.985 --> 00:07:24.905
{\an8}reckless endangerment and
damage to city property.

175
00:07:25.405 --> 00:07:26.573
These charges warrant that

176
00:07:26.656 --> 00:07:28.491
{\an8}you could spend five
years in prison.

177
00:07:28.575 --> 00:07:29.659
There it is.

178
00:07:29.743 --> 00:07:31.536
{\an8}But I've decided

179
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.622
{\an8}that I'm gonna go a
different direction.

180
00:07:34.372 --> 00:07:35.498
Thank you, Judge,

181
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.185
{\an8}for the celebrity
treatment. I appreciate it.

182
00:07:37.209 --> 00:07:38.585
{\an8}This motherfucker.

183
00:07:38.668 --> 00:07:41.421
{\an8}I'm recommending that
you spend 300 hours

184
00:07:41.504 --> 00:07:43.340
of community service
with the Long Beach

185
00:07:43.423 --> 00:07:45.217
{\an8}Parks and Recreations
Department.

186
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.968
{\an8}- The fuck?

187
00:07:47.052 --> 00:07:49.387
{\an8}Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait a minute, Judge.

188
00:07:49.471 --> 00:07:50.639
I thought I was getting like

189
00:07:50.722 --> 00:07:52.557
{\an8}some Martha Stewart
kinda treatment.

190
00:07:52.641 --> 00:07:54.017
{\an8}Community service in Long Beach,

191
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.260
that ain't gonna work for me.

192
00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.979
{\an8}You too good for the
community that raised you?

193
00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:59.999
{\an8}Or maybe you just
don't wanna go back,

194
00:08:00.023 --> 00:08:01.858
{\an8}after 20 years of
not being home,

195
00:08:01.942 --> 00:08:04.527
{\an8}in a orange vest and
a pooper-scooper.

196
00:08:05.111 --> 00:08:06.112
{\an8}Oh, shit.

197
00:08:09.699 --> 00:08:11.534
Janine? Is that you?

198
00:08:12.035 --> 00:08:14.746
{\an8}Freshman year, white
American history class?

199
00:08:15.247 --> 00:08:17.916
{\an8}Where we used to play
hide and go get it.

200
00:08:17.999 --> 00:08:19.668
Come on, girl, you
can't cut me no break?

201
00:08:20.168 --> 00:08:21.962
{\an8}My name is not Janine.

202
00:08:22.045 --> 00:08:23.088
Oh!

203
00:08:23.171 --> 00:08:24.256
{\an8}It's Tara.

204
00:08:26.174 --> 00:08:27.926
{\an8}We grew up on the same block.

205
00:08:28.468 --> 00:08:29.552
Fuck.

206
00:08:30.011 --> 00:08:31.596
{\an8}Your narcissistic ass.

207
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.115
{\an8}Just get the hell
out of my courtroom,

208
00:08:33.139 --> 00:08:35.350
{\an8}so I can call everybody
we grew up with

209
00:08:35.433 --> 00:08:37.894
{\an8}and tell them that they can
catch your Hollywood ass

210
00:08:37.978 --> 00:08:40.230
{\an8}right up in the park,
scooping up dog shit.

211
00:08:42.524 --> 00:08:43.525
Next!

212
00:08:47.487 --> 00:08:49.572
- You're moving too slow.

213
00:09:04.004 --> 00:09:06.506
Back in the hood,
picking up dog shit.

214
00:09:06.589 --> 00:09:08.300
Wow.

215
00:09:19.936 --> 00:09:20.937
Wow.

216
00:09:22.939 --> 00:09:24.566
Keys!
- Mothafucka!

217
00:09:25.066 --> 00:09:26.386
Cuz, the car don't
come with keys.

218
00:09:26.443 --> 00:09:27.920
Shut the fuck up
before I bust your head

219
00:09:27.944 --> 00:09:28.945
to the white meat, nigga.

220
00:09:29.029 --> 00:09:30.947
I start the car with my phone.

221
00:09:31.031 --> 00:09:33.408
Give me the motherfucking keys!

222
00:09:33.491 --> 00:09:35.785
Look, you can have
the phone and my car,

223
00:09:35.869 --> 00:09:37.388
just let me clear the
videos real quick.

224
00:09:37.412 --> 00:09:38.496
Niggas see this sex tape

00:09:38.872 --> 00:09:40.141

Lampanelli, I'm finished.

226
00:09:40.165 --> 00:09:41.458
Nigga, don't play with...

227
00:09:51.343 --> 00:09:52.385
Jaycen?

228
00:09:54.012 --> 00:09:55.055
Kareem?

229
00:09:55.138 --> 00:09:56.598
Nigga!

230
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.518
Mothafucka, you just put
a gun to my head, nigga.

231
00:10:00.602 --> 00:10:02.354
Relax, J, the safety was on.

232
00:10:02.896 --> 00:10:04.147
- It's on safe... No.

233
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.066
It ain't on safety. Damn.

234
00:10:06.149 --> 00:10:07.442
Imagine that.

235
00:10:07.525 --> 00:10:09.277
Ahh! Nigga. I've been trying

236
00:10:09.361 --> 00:10:10.987
to get in touch
with you for years.

237
00:10:11.071 --> 00:10:12.155
- Huh?
- Literally.

238
00:10:12.238 --> 00:10:13.406
For a million years.

239
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.200

242
00:10:19.913 --> 00:10:20.997
"Leave him alone.

243
00:10:21.081 --> 00:10:22.957
"Cuz, you hittin' him too much.

244
00:10:23.041 --> 00:10:24.334
"You a stalker.

245
00:10:24.417 --> 00:10:26.461
"You sweatin' him,

246
00:10:26.544 --> 00:10:28.505
I told her, "Girl,

247
00:10:28.588 --> 00:10:30.632
"He would never do
no shit like that."

248

249
00:10:32.217 --> 00:10:34.195

to get in touch with me.

Yeah, that's how
I feel about you,

00:10:36.513 --> 00:10:37.782
that's exactly how I
feel about you, cuz.

253
00:10:37.806 --> 00:10:39.849
Yeah, I knew it. I
knew that was right.

Come on now, dawg. Those

00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:33.922
Obviously, these cost more

297
00:12:34.005 --> 00:12:35.065
than everything in
your fuckin' house.

298
00:12:35.089 --> 00:12:36.591
You tryna tell me a janitor

- That nigga a crackhead.

303
00:12:44.307 --> 00:12:45.517
You lucky I'm on probation,

00:12:47.268 --> 00:12:48.829
Man, shut yo crackhead ass

308
00:12:53.942 --> 00:12:56.069
Hey, you in charge of these

00:12:56.152 --> 00:12:57.487
One second.

310
00:12:58.029 --> 00:13:01.699
I'm sorry, are you suggesting
that this is their fault?

311
00:13:01.783 --> 00:13:03.177
Lady, you're being
real rude right now.

312
00:13:03.201 --> 00:13:04.452
And I said, one second!

313
00:13:06.788 --> 00:13:08.039
Oh, shit!

314
00:13:08.998 --> 00:13:11.960
Mm! God damn, baby,

315
00:13:12.043 --> 00:13:14.128
Jaycen, uh, can you

316
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:16.172

319
00:13:19.592 --> 00:13:21.094
Hold on, Mama, you

320
00:13:21.177 --> 00:13:22.845
Mama? This little
piece of shit mine?

321
00:13:22.929 --> 00:13:24.472
You better watch your mouth.

322
00:13:24.556 --> 00:13:25.908
When the last time me and
you was together, what,

323
00:13:25.932 --> 00:13:27.642
'03, '04, Provo?

324
00:13:27.725 --> 00:13:28.726
You do the math.

325
00:13:29.227 --> 00:13:31.229
- Nah, he ain't mine.

326
00:13:31.729 --> 00:13:33.022
We're leaving, let's go.

327
00:13:33.606 --> 00:13:34.732
Already?

328
00:13:35.024 --> 00:13:36.794
Cherise, I drove all the way
to Long Beach just to see you.

329
00:13:36.818 --> 00:13:38.128
You came all the
way to Long Beach

330
00:13:38.152 --> 00:13:39.320
to pick up dog shit.

331
00:13:39.404 --> 00:13:40.905
Fuck Tara.

332
00:13:40.989 --> 00:13:43.533
Ain't nobody seen you
around here in 20 years.

333
00:13:43.616 --> 00:13:45.118
Let's go. Come on, boys.

334
00:13:45.201 --> 00:13:47.453
Let's let this man
serve his community.

335
00:13:47.537 --> 00:13:48.538
What about practice?

336
00:13:48.997 --> 00:13:50.290
It's canceled for today.

337
00:13:50.373 --> 00:13:52.000
Where's Coach?

338
00:13:52.083 --> 00:13:53.918
He quit, huh?
Come on, let's go.

339
00:13:54.002 --> 00:13:55.336
Hold on, let me get my stuff.

340
00:13:57.755 --> 00:14:01.134
<i>In football, you gotta
have a short memory.</i>

341
00:14:02.385 --> 00:14:03.386
<i>Fuck a play up,</i>

342
00:14:04.345 --> 00:14:06.598
<i>- and move on.</i>

343
00:14:07.307 --> 00:14:08.349
Hey, sweet face.

344
00:14:08.433 --> 00:14:09.517
I'm headed to the clinic

345
00:14:09.601 --> 00:14:10.661
and I'll be back in a few hours.

346
00:14:10.685 --> 00:14:11.728
- Okay?
- All right.

347
00:14:11.811 --> 00:14:13.131
- Mwah. Love you.
- Love you, too.

348
00:14:13.479 --> 00:14:16.190
- Too slow. Too slow.

349
00:14:17.275 --> 00:14:19.277
<i>That's exactly how
I live my life.</i>

350
00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.822
<i>Can't be wasting time
thinking about bullshit.</i>

351
00:14:22.905 --> 00:14:24.449
<i>Hurdles into the end zone.</i>

352
00:14:24.782 --> 00:14:27.493
<i>And Jaycen Jennings smoked
both defenders on that one.</i>

353
00:14:27.577 --> 00:14:28.703
Damn!

354
00:14:29.579 --> 00:14:31.998
<i>Like that one girl you was
always trippin' off of...</i>

355
00:14:33.833 --> 00:14:35.918
<i>No matter how good
she still look...</i>

356
00:14:38.046 --> 00:14:39.505
<i>I'm a firm believer.</i>

357
00:14:42.884 --> 00:14:44.484
- Hold this for me, okay?
- Jaycen, what?

358
00:14:45.094 --> 00:14:46.471
I love you, Cherise.

359
00:14:46.554 --> 00:14:49.015
<i>To stay outta the past.</i>

360
00:14:50.308 --> 00:14:52.226
No matter how good
she still looks.

361
00:14:55.313 --> 00:14:56.606
Did I say that already?

362
00:14:57.649 --> 00:14:59.025
Damn, I just said that.

363
00:15:02.695 --> 00:15:04.906
Who the fuck
ringing my doorbell?

364
00:15:04.989 --> 00:15:06.199
All right, I'm coming.

365
00:15:07.825 --> 00:15:10.787
Family. What's
happening, baby?

366
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.413
What the fuck is you doing here?

367
00:15:12.497 --> 00:15:14.832
Hey, man, I needed a place
to lay low for a while.

368
00:15:14.916 --> 00:15:16.834
- Man, this is beautiful, baby.
- For a while?

369
00:15:16.918 --> 00:15:18.294
Yeah, for a while, man.

370
00:15:18.378 --> 00:15:19.813
Well, how the fuck
you know where I live?

371
00:15:19.837 --> 00:15:21.214
How I know where you live?

372
00:15:21.589 --> 00:15:24.967
Oh, man, your phone bills,
man, your credit score, mail.

373
00:15:25.051 --> 00:15:27.428
Hey, man, you gotta be careful
who you give your number to.

374
00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:29.972
I mean, come on, you
know it's me, baby.

375
00:15:30.056 --> 00:15:32.558
And you know, I
got the THC. 100%.

376
00:15:33.142 --> 00:15:35.770
Pow. That shit will
make a nun get naked.

377
00:15:38.189 --> 00:15:40.233
<i>Yeah, name one nigga in the
hood that play like this</i>

378
00:15:40.316 --> 00:15:43.903
<i>I like my weed, uh</i>

379
00:15:43.986 --> 00:15:46.364
<i>- In the mornin' -
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah</i>

380
00:15:46.447 --> 00:15:49.200
<i>- I like my weed -
Said I like my weed</i>

381
00:15:49.283 --> 00:15:53.788
Man, them legalizing weed
put a dent in my capital,

382
00:15:53.871 --> 00:15:56.541
but that shit is bomb
as a mothafucker.

383
00:15:56.624 --> 00:15:59.001
You right, this shit is
bomb as a mothafucker.

384
00:15:59.085 --> 00:16:02.171
And look, the crazy
thing about it is,

385
00:16:02.255 --> 00:16:04.674
I copped the weed down
on 15th and Atlantic.

386
00:16:04.757 --> 00:16:06.008
Our old corner?

387
00:16:06.092 --> 00:16:07.844
Yeah, our spot.

388
00:16:07.927 --> 00:16:09.804
Where we used to
sling the pounds at.

389
00:16:09.887 --> 00:16:11.431
Cuz, you still selling weed?

390
00:16:13.599 --> 00:16:15.226
Have you ever sat
back and thought

391
00:16:15.309 --> 00:16:17.061
what you wanna do
with your life?

392
00:16:17.145 --> 00:16:21.232
Many a time, but I mean, look,
man, I got tattoos on my face.

393
00:16:21.983 --> 00:16:23.943
Ain't nobody fuckin'
with me, man.

394
00:16:24.026 --> 00:16:26.195
I feel you, homie,

395
00:16:26.279 --> 00:16:29.198
but I seen somebody today
from back in the day

396
00:16:29.282 --> 00:16:31.868
that didn't look like they
was doing too bad for herself.

397
00:16:31.951 --> 00:16:33.161
Cherise?

398
00:16:33.244 --> 00:16:35.872
- How you know?
- I can tell how

399
00:16:35.955 --> 00:16:37.331
you got that little
kiddy-ass grin

400
00:16:37.415 --> 00:16:38.684
on your face when
you say her name.

401
00:16:38.708 --> 00:16:39.935
Cuz, ain't nobody
grinning, nigga.

402
00:16:39.959 --> 00:16:41.878
Yes, you is. Boy,
you love that girl,

403
00:16:41.961 --> 00:16:43.421
- Cherise, man.

404
00:16:43.504 --> 00:16:45.344
Hey, but look, she thicker
than a motherfucker.

405
00:16:46.048 --> 00:16:48.050
I'm talkin' about
thicker than a Snicker.

406
00:16:48.134 --> 00:16:49.260
Shut up.

407
00:16:49.343 --> 00:16:51.743
And she doing good for herself,
she got the clinic down there

408
00:16:51.929 --> 00:16:53.848
where she helping the
kids with the broken arm.

409
00:16:53.931 --> 00:16:55.683
She help the people
with the dialysis.

410
00:16:55.767 --> 00:16:58.853
Man, she even help me when
I got stabbed that 17 times.

411
00:16:58.936 --> 00:17:00.480
Nigga, you got stabbed?

412
00:17:00.563 --> 00:17:03.603
- You ain't hear? They didn't tell you I almost lost my arm?
- No, let me see.

413
00:17:03.691 --> 00:17:04.817
Oh, Cuz, you...

414
00:17:04.901 --> 00:17:06.068
Damn!

415
00:17:06.152 --> 00:17:09.071
They said I lost
350,000 pounds of blood.

416
00:17:09.155 --> 00:17:10.156
That much blood?

417
00:17:10.531 --> 00:17:12.200
I ain't hear nothing
about that one.

418
00:17:12.283 --> 00:17:13.659
But anyway... What happened

419
00:17:13.743 --> 00:17:15.661
to you and Cherise
after high school, man?

420
00:17:15.745 --> 00:17:18.831
Come on, my nigga, you know,
your nigga can't be tied down.

421
00:17:18.915 --> 00:17:20.708
Right, right,
right, right, right.

422
00:17:20.792 --> 00:17:23.002
But you should've seen how
she was on me today though.

423
00:17:23.085 --> 00:17:24.879
But her little
cockblockin'-ass son

424
00:17:24.962 --> 00:17:26.339
and his little football team,

425
00:17:26.422 --> 00:17:27.941
they gotta hurry up
and find a head coach,

426
00:17:27.965 --> 00:17:29.550
so I can slide up on her

427
00:17:29.634 --> 00:17:32.011
and get my peep on at
the park every week.

428
00:17:32.094 --> 00:17:33.197
You know what I'm talking about?

429
00:17:33.221 --> 00:17:35.223
You tryna Emilio
Estevez that ass,

430
00:17:35.306 --> 00:17:36.432
that's what you's tryna do.

431
00:17:36.516 --> 00:17:37.517
Emilio who?

432
00:17:38.184 --> 00:17:39.477
Emilio Estevez.

433
00:17:40.019 --> 00:17:43.523
Man, he played the
coach on <i>Mighty Ducks.</i>

434
00:17:43.606 --> 00:17:46.734
Man, he ran a cold game
on Joshua Jackson's momma.

435
00:17:46.818 --> 00:17:49.028
First, he taught him
how to use the puck,

436
00:17:49.111 --> 00:17:50.780
then he turned around,

437
00:17:50.863 --> 00:17:52.573
taught her how to use the stick.

438
00:17:53.282 --> 00:17:54.784
Man, he got that pussy,

439
00:17:55.076 --> 00:17:58.287
and became an American hero
at the same mothafuckin' time.

440
00:18:00.289 --> 00:18:01.290
Kareem,

441
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:06.170
you kiddie movie genius
watching mothafucka.

442
00:18:06.254 --> 00:18:07.547
I could just see it now.

443
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:10.299
Jaycen Jennings,
football legend,

444
00:18:10.383 --> 00:18:12.426
- goes back...
- Yeah.

445
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:15.721
And saves a ol' raggedy-ass
Pop Warner football team

446
00:18:15.805 --> 00:18:16.806
in his neighborhood.

447
00:18:16.889 --> 00:18:18.057
Yeah, say that then.

448
00:18:18.516 --> 00:18:20.685
You know, people love when
people fuck with poor kids.

449
00:18:20.768 --> 00:18:23.938
This just may be my
way to get America

450
00:18:24.021 --> 00:18:25.273
and Cherise

451
00:18:25.356 --> 00:18:28.109
to fuck with Two-J's
all over again.

452
00:18:28.192 --> 00:18:30.278
You know, God works
in mysterious ways.

453
00:18:30.361 --> 00:18:31.988
- Really do.
- And I love you, boy.

454
00:18:32.071 --> 00:18:33.656
I love you, too.

455
00:18:33.739 --> 00:18:34.907
What the fuck?

456
00:18:36.367 --> 00:18:37.493
Kareem.

457
00:18:37.577 --> 00:18:39.161
Safety was on it, cuz.

458
00:18:40.371 --> 00:18:41.539
Oh, nope.

459
00:18:42.164 --> 00:18:44.083
The safety wasn't on it again.

460
00:18:44.166 --> 00:18:46.961
I'm gonna go home and put
some duct tape on the handle.

461
00:18:56.429 --> 00:18:57.889
- Aye, Ms. Cherise. Hmm.

462
00:18:57.972 --> 00:18:59.515
This new coach coming or what?

463
00:18:59.599 --> 00:19:01.142
There's a group
of girls posted up

464
00:19:01.225 --> 00:19:02.685
at the parking lot,
checking for me.

465
00:19:02.768 --> 00:19:04.186
Man, they ain't checking on you.

466
00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:06.397
Checking on this
big-ass <i>pito</i> right here.

467
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.316
Enough! No more dick talk.

468
00:19:08.399 --> 00:19:09.668
We've already talked about this.

469
00:19:09.692 --> 00:19:11.110
It's not cute. It's not funny.

470
00:19:11.527 --> 00:19:12.612
Stop smiling, Tony.

471
00:19:12.987 --> 00:19:14.787
It's very creepy. Nobody
likes the creepy kid.

472
00:19:14.822 --> 00:19:16.324
- Understand me?

473
00:19:16.407 --> 00:19:18.075
- Yes, Ms. Evans.
- Okay.

474
00:19:18.492 --> 00:19:20.244
God, I love it when she
puts me in my place.

475
00:19:20.328 --> 00:19:22.163
- What was that?
- Uh, nothing, nothing.

476
00:19:27.084 --> 00:19:28.085
Oh, shit.

477
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.296
What the...

478
00:19:30.379 --> 00:19:31.797
Damn, it's hella bright though.

479
00:19:31.881 --> 00:19:33.049
That's a Benz.

480
00:19:35.092 --> 00:19:36.469
What?

481
00:19:36.552 --> 00:19:37.929
That thing is so bright.

482
00:19:38.429 --> 00:19:39.972
That is nice.

483
00:19:42.141 --> 00:19:44.268
Yo, isn't that the
crackhead janitor

484
00:19:44.352 --> 00:19:45.912
that was cleaning up
poop the other day?

485
00:19:45.937 --> 00:19:47.396
Looking like a hip-hop pirate.

486
00:19:48.731 --> 00:19:49.732
You gotta be kidding me.

487
00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:52.568
Y'all thought I was a
crackhead janitor, huh?

488
00:19:52.652 --> 00:19:54.153
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yes.

489
00:19:54.236 --> 00:19:57.073
Well, turns out, I'm
a rich-ass celebrity.

490
00:19:57.156 --> 00:19:58.991
And when I heard
about y'all league

491
00:19:59.075 --> 00:20:00.284
not being able to find y'all

492
00:20:00.368 --> 00:20:02.453
one decent, respectable citizen

493
00:20:02.536 --> 00:20:04.080
to mentor you little dudes,

494
00:20:04.163 --> 00:20:06.040
shit kinda broke my heart.

495
00:20:06.123 --> 00:20:07.792
- What?
- So, I decided to work out

496
00:20:07.875 --> 00:20:09.251
a deal with the
Los Angeles County

497
00:20:09.335 --> 00:20:10.878
Community Outreach Program,

498
00:20:10.962 --> 00:20:12.254
so you could have

499
00:20:12.338 --> 00:20:15.341
football legend, Jaycen
'Two-J's' Jennings,

500
00:20:15.424 --> 00:20:18.010
as your new head coach.

501
00:20:18.094 --> 00:20:19.971
- Legend?

502
00:20:20.054 --> 00:20:21.305
Man, get outta here, dawg.

503
00:20:21.389 --> 00:20:22.640
Oh, shit, I know who he is.

504
00:20:22.723 --> 00:20:23.808
Good lookin' out.

505
00:20:24.141 --> 00:20:25.661
'Bout time y'all put
some respect on my name.

506
00:20:25.685 --> 00:20:27.937
Nah, he used a fake penis
to cheat on drug tests.

507
00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.231
You that same guy

508
00:20:30.314 --> 00:20:31.959
who tried to have sex
with a undercover cop

509
00:20:31.983 --> 00:20:33.359
the night before a playoff game.

510
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.028
Yeah, and the dude who also...

511
00:20:36.112 --> 00:20:38.155
Won one of these, you
booger-nosed mothafuckas.

512
00:20:38.239 --> 00:20:39.365
That's real? Bro,

513
00:20:39.907 --> 00:20:41.218
what's with you and all
these random knockoff shit?

514
00:20:41.242 --> 00:20:42.410
Knockoff?

515
00:20:42.493 --> 00:20:44.412
Nigga, my shit is
100% certified.

516
00:20:44.495 --> 00:20:46.539
- You fuckin' loser.
- Watch it, Jaycen.

517
00:20:46.622 --> 00:20:48.124
They ain't won a
game all season.

518
00:20:48.207 --> 00:20:49.917
They're losers.
It's just a fact.

519
00:20:50.418 --> 00:20:51.502
Damn.

520
00:20:52.086 --> 00:20:53.772
Let me get a picture with
y'all real quick for Twitter.

521
00:20:53.796 --> 00:20:54.880
What?

522
00:20:55.214 --> 00:20:56.934
Anybody got, like, a
clipboard or a whistle,

523
00:20:57.008 --> 00:20:58.485
so I can look like
I'm coaching for real?

524
00:20:58.509 --> 00:20:59.844
Fake-ass coach, man.

525
00:20:59.927 --> 00:21:01.405
- All right, fuck it.
No one wants you here.

526
00:21:01.429 --> 00:21:02.823
Man, don't be no
stranger to danger,

527
00:21:02.847 --> 00:21:04.032
squeeze in for this fuckin'
picture for Twitter,

528
00:21:04.056 --> 00:21:05.391
- come on.

529
00:21:05.474 --> 00:21:06.785
Some of y'all gonna
get some girlfriends

530
00:21:06.809 --> 00:21:08.310
when I finish with
this right here.

531
00:21:08.394 --> 00:21:10.229
Come on, man, don't be
flippin' me off, man,

532
00:21:10.312 --> 00:21:11.772
- give me some real shit, man.

533
00:21:13.024 --> 00:21:14.275
Got 'em! Yes, sir.

534
00:21:14.358 --> 00:21:15.735
Team dismissed.

535
00:21:15.818 --> 00:21:18.237
What? We got a game
against the best team

536
00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.780
in the league this weekend.

537
00:21:19.864 --> 00:21:21.299
And you haven't even
seen us practice.

538
00:21:21.323 --> 00:21:22.575
Go run them drills.

539
00:21:22.658 --> 00:21:24.535
- Drills?
- On the hop.

540
00:21:24.618 --> 00:21:27.997
Let's go. On the hop
means run, not walk.

541
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.249
Y'all got y'all a
coach now, hurry up.

542
00:21:30.332 --> 00:21:32.001
I don't know, man,
get your stuff, man.

543
00:21:32.084 --> 00:21:34.879
- And you, chocolate sundae.

544
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.215
What you doin' later
tonight? Wanna grab a drink?

545
00:21:39.008 --> 00:21:40.051
You still smoke?

546
00:21:45.806 --> 00:21:47.975
"Blessed as fuck to
share my greatness

547
00:21:48.059 --> 00:21:49.351
"with the next generation.

548
00:21:49.977 --> 00:21:52.605
"Prayer hands emoji.

549
00:21:52.688 --> 00:21:54.732
"Hashtag, giving
back is what I do.

550
00:21:55.399 --> 00:21:56.776
"More than an athlete.

551
00:21:56.859 --> 00:22:00.237
"Hashtag, poor kids
need love too."

552
00:22:02.698 --> 00:22:05.117
Man, you really click
in with them kids, huh?

553
00:22:05.618 --> 00:22:07.787
It really look like I give
a fuck about 'em, right?

554
00:22:09.246 --> 00:22:11.791
For real. For real,
man. That's real.

555
00:22:11.874 --> 00:22:14.376
Hey, man. I was thinkin' about

556
00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.378
what you said about
my life the other day,

557
00:22:16.462 --> 00:22:18.672
and then boom, it hit me.

558
00:22:19.548 --> 00:22:21.717
Assistant Coach Kareem.

559
00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:28.224
I don't think it's gonna
work, Kareem. That's not...

560
00:22:28.307 --> 00:22:29.433
I don't know, man.

561
00:22:29.725 --> 00:22:32.186
You offensive coach,
I'm defensive coach.

562
00:22:32.269 --> 00:22:34.188
Bam, we gonna be like
<i>Batman and Robin.</i>

563
00:22:34.271 --> 00:22:35.773
They gonna love it.

564
00:22:35.856 --> 00:22:37.942
I like your thought process
and your enthusiasm.

565
00:22:38.025 --> 00:22:40.778
This is a career move.
This is big for me, man.

566
00:22:40.861 --> 00:22:42.321
But, homie, I'm workin'

567
00:22:42.404 --> 00:22:44.156
on my clean-cut coaching
brand right here.

568
00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.600
Hey, man, don't say that, man,
don't do that. Don't do that.

569
00:22:46.784 --> 00:22:48.869
And you got a face
full of tattoos, so...

570
00:22:53.666 --> 00:22:54.750
Oh, you gonna unfollow me

571
00:22:54.834 --> 00:22:56.127
- 'cause of that?
- Yeah, yeah.

572
00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:57.770
- That's petty.
- You wanna play unfair?

573
00:22:57.878 --> 00:22:59.231
- That's petty, that's petty.
- You wanna play unfair?

574
00:22:59.255 --> 00:23:00.357
- That's fuckin' petty.
- What we doin'?

575
00:23:00.381 --> 00:23:01.566
What you mean,
"What we doin'?"

576
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:02.800
What we doin', man?

577
00:23:02.883 --> 00:23:04.426
Nigga, you not the
assistant coach.

578
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:08.264
- Like that?
- Yeah, it's like that.

579
00:23:11.183 --> 00:23:13.394
Where the fuck is you going,
cuz? This is my house.

580
00:23:13.477 --> 00:23:15.396
I'm 'bout to eat.
- Hold on, cuz.

581
00:23:15.479 --> 00:23:16.772
I'm taking the pizza poppers.

582
00:23:16.856 --> 00:23:17.940
Slow down, little nigga.

583
00:23:18.023 --> 00:23:19.567
It's my mothafuckin' house.

584
00:23:22.945 --> 00:23:24.155
Oh. Excuse me.

585
00:23:24.238 --> 00:23:25.281
You the new coach?

586
00:23:25.698 --> 00:23:27.217
Yeah, that's me. What,
somebody talkin' me up?

587
00:23:27.241 --> 00:23:29.410
Yeah. My son, Gary,

588
00:23:29.493 --> 00:23:31.370
told me you made him run a lap.

589
00:23:32.246 --> 00:23:33.247
I got my eye on you.

590
00:23:33.706 --> 00:23:34.707
Oh, Gary, baby.

591
00:23:35.124 --> 00:23:36.750
I got your inhaler on deck.

592
00:23:36.834 --> 00:23:39.086
You just say the word and
Momma be on that field

593
00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:41.338
faster than you can
say asthma attack.

594
00:23:44.091 --> 00:23:45.092
All right, y'all.

595
00:23:45.176 --> 00:23:46.886
You can grab your jerseys.

596
00:23:47.344 --> 00:23:48.679
I got 'em all
cleaned up for you.

597
00:23:48.762 --> 00:23:50.639
You gonna look fantastic
out there today.

598
00:23:50.723 --> 00:23:52.016
Oh, uh-uh. Hell, no.

599
00:23:52.099 --> 00:23:53.767
Wait a minute, let
me see this shit.

600
00:23:53.851 --> 00:23:55.603
Russell Athletics.

601
00:23:55.686 --> 00:23:58.147
Faded numbers. No
nicknames on the back.

602
00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:59.523
This is garbage.

603
00:23:59.607 --> 00:24:01.367
- This what we own?
- They're the Green team.

604
00:24:01.442 --> 00:24:03.319
Green team? We cool
with Green team?

605
00:24:03.402 --> 00:24:04.778
- Mm-hmm. Actually,

606
00:24:04.862 --> 00:24:06.155
I think it would
be quite amazing

607
00:24:06.238 --> 00:24:07.465
if we can name
ourself The Dragons.

608
00:24:07.489 --> 00:24:08.490
Man, quit it

609
00:24:09.033 --> 00:24:10.910
with your <i>Game of Thrones</i>
virgin-ass bullshit.

610
00:24:10.993 --> 00:24:12.745
Tre, you're a virgin
too. So be quiet.

611
00:24:12.828 --> 00:24:14.205
- And watch your mouth.

612
00:24:14.288 --> 00:24:15.664
This shit is depressing, man.

613
00:24:15.748 --> 00:24:17.374
Okay, enough.

614
00:24:22.171 --> 00:24:24.006
Positions! Line up!

615
00:24:26.592 --> 00:24:28.385
Now, that's how the fuck
you supposed to look

616
00:24:28.469 --> 00:24:30.471
when you come to a
game. Just like that.

617
00:24:31.555 --> 00:24:33.098
You dress the part,
you play the part.

618
00:24:33.724 --> 00:24:34.767
Oh, my God.

619
00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.195
Fuckin' Chip Collins.

620
00:24:46.278 --> 00:24:47.988
- Colonels!

621
00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.267
Is that a freaking
drill sergeant

622
00:24:59.291 --> 00:25:00.668
coaching the team,
what the hell?

623
00:25:00.751 --> 00:25:02.544
And what do men do? Dominate!

624
00:25:02.628 --> 00:25:03.629
And what do men do?

625
00:25:03.712 --> 00:25:04.713
Dominate!

626
00:25:04.797 --> 00:25:06.257
And what do men...

627
00:25:07.633 --> 00:25:09.760
Hold on. Is that...

628
00:25:09.843 --> 00:25:12.096
Oh, my Lord, Two-J's.

629
00:25:12.179 --> 00:25:16.267
Wow! You look, uh,
like a couch, man.

630
00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:17.977
Is everything okay?

631
00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.979
Are you living in
this park here?

632
00:25:20.062 --> 00:25:22.398
I know they say that
Black don't crack, but

633
00:25:22.481 --> 00:25:24.900
I see some fractures
in it right now.

634
00:25:24.984 --> 00:25:27.111
I don't live in this park.
I'm here working, coaching.

635
00:25:27.194 --> 00:25:29.363
- You're... You're coaching?
- Yes.

636
00:25:29.446 --> 00:25:30.739
- Children?
- Mm-hmm.

637
00:25:30.823 --> 00:25:32.408
Oh, the community service thing.

638
00:25:32.491 --> 00:25:34.451
'Cause you drive like
Helen Keller. Gotcha.

639
00:25:34.535 --> 00:25:35.869
- Fuck you, Chip.
- Look,

640
00:25:36.287 --> 00:25:38.223
I know, me and you haven't
seen eye to eye on everything.

641
00:25:38.247 --> 00:25:40.624
Okay, I've said some things.
You've tweeted some things.

642
00:25:40.708 --> 00:25:43.335
But let's put that aside

643
00:25:43.419 --> 00:25:45.546
and focus on the real
reason why we're here.

644
00:25:45.629 --> 00:25:46.755
And what's that?

645
00:25:47.298 --> 00:25:50.092
The positive PR we get from
coaching peewee football.

646
00:25:54.096 --> 00:25:56.265
Joking, man. I'm joking.

647
00:25:56.348 --> 00:25:58.183
No, the kids, we're
here to save the kids,

648
00:25:58.267 --> 00:26:00.269
you know, they'd be out
there doing drive-bys

649
00:26:00.352 --> 00:26:02.032
or whatever else you
guys do in Long Beach.

650
00:26:02.104 --> 00:26:03.355
We are here to be heroes.

651
00:26:03.439 --> 00:26:04.773
You're a hero. Okay?

652
00:26:04.857 --> 00:26:07.234
Government enforced,
but you're still a hero.

653
00:26:07.318 --> 00:26:08.569
I love you, man.

654
00:26:10.321 --> 00:26:12.156
Stretch louder!

655
00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:14.575
Bitch-ass, punk-ass bitch.

656
00:26:15.868 --> 00:26:17.077
Get up,

657
00:26:17.161 --> 00:26:18.620
get dressed, get
up and get to it.

658
00:26:18.704 --> 00:26:19.788
I don't got all day.

659
00:26:19.872 --> 00:26:21.112
I did not come out here to lose

660
00:26:21.165 --> 00:26:22.541
to no bitch-ass Chip Collins.

661
00:26:22.624 --> 00:26:24.102
Man, we got no shot
at winning this thing.

662
00:26:24.126 --> 00:26:25.726
I mean, you see their
team, they're huge.

663
00:26:25.794 --> 00:26:26.837
I know, right?

664
00:26:27.212 --> 00:26:28.440
I heard they only recruit
high-school dudes.

665
00:26:28.464 --> 00:26:30.341
I heard they lineman got a baby.

666
00:26:30.424 --> 00:26:32.134
Man, who gives a
fuck what they got?

667
00:26:32.217 --> 00:26:34.553
Put y'all helmets on and
don't fuckin' embarrass me.

668
00:26:34.636 --> 00:26:36.513
Let's go, on the
hop. Let's go!

669
00:26:37.806 --> 00:26:38.807
Yeah, that's it!

670
00:26:40.809 --> 00:26:42.269
Hustle, hustle, hustle!

671
00:26:43.479 --> 00:26:45.314
Be ready, guys, be ready!

672
00:26:45.397 --> 00:26:46.815
You are hungry.
You are hungry.

673
00:26:52.363 --> 00:26:53.822
Damn, he kicked the
shit outta that.

674
00:26:53.906 --> 00:26:55.324
I got it!

675
00:26:56.158 --> 00:26:57.951
Come on! Defense!

676
00:26:58.035 --> 00:26:59.328
- Ooh, shit.

677
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.413
Oh, come on, man.

678
00:27:01.497 --> 00:27:03.749
Booyah! That's what
I'm talkin' about.

679
00:27:03.832 --> 00:27:05.292
- Touchdown!

680
00:27:05.376 --> 00:27:06.543
Hell of a start there.

681
00:27:06.627 --> 00:27:07.711
First play?

682
00:27:07.795 --> 00:27:10.089
Let's go! Oh, get
some, little boy!

683
00:27:10.923 --> 00:27:12.508
You should call an ambulance.

684
00:27:12.591 --> 00:27:14.676
Two hundred points off
that kid's SAT score.

685
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:15.969
- Guaranteed.

686
00:27:16.053 --> 00:27:18.406
So, y'all don't know what the
fuck "don't embarrass me" mean?

687
00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:19.640
Damn!

688
00:27:19.723 --> 00:27:21.558
Tre, Tre, Tre.

689
00:27:21.642 --> 00:27:23.102
- Let's go, Tre.
- Go, go, go.

690
00:27:26.105 --> 00:27:27.189
- Oh, damn!

691
00:27:27.815 --> 00:27:29.942
- Oh, sh... Oh!

692
00:27:30.025 --> 00:27:31.652
Nice! Nice!

693
00:27:31.735 --> 00:27:33.415
Do you have a knife
wound in that shoulder?

694
00:27:35.864 --> 00:27:38.409
- Hey!
- That was filthy, young man.

695
00:27:38.492 --> 00:27:39.701
Catch him! He's so little!

696
00:27:41.412 --> 00:27:42.579
Fuckin' scary, Rise.

697
00:27:42.663 --> 00:27:44.123
We open.

698
00:27:44.206 --> 00:27:45.749
God damn it, you wide open!

699
00:27:45.833 --> 00:27:47.626
- Dang! Get that shit!

700
00:27:50.212 --> 00:27:51.338
Get your ass up! Get up!

701
00:27:51.755 --> 00:27:53.882
Let's go, let's go,
defense, markup!

702
00:27:53.966 --> 00:27:56.218
Great hands!
Bravo! Keep it up.

703
00:27:57.928 --> 00:27:59.012
- Look at this shit.

704
00:27:59.096 --> 00:28:00.931
- Whoo!

705
00:28:01.014 --> 00:28:02.182
Coach, I'm gonna be honest.

706
00:28:02.266 --> 00:28:03.546
I don't think I need this today.

707
00:28:03.934 --> 00:28:04.935
Aah!

708
00:28:05.477 --> 00:28:07.020
- Sorry mothafuckers!
- Sorry, Coach.

709
00:28:07.104 --> 00:28:08.480
God damn!

710
00:28:10.274 --> 00:28:12.067
Huddle! Huddle up,
damn it. Come on.

711
00:28:12.151 --> 00:28:13.318
What's the play?

712
00:28:13.819 --> 00:28:15.946
The play is get outta my
way and let me do my thing.

713
00:28:16.029 --> 00:28:17.030
- Aight?
- What?

714
00:28:17.114 --> 00:28:18.407
- Break!
- Bro, what?

715
00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:19.950
I'mma handle this on my own.

716
00:28:21.201 --> 00:28:24.830
- Let's go, Tre.
Down, set, hut!

717
00:28:28.542 --> 00:28:30.878
Ooh, shit! That
little mothafucka go!

718
00:28:30.961 --> 00:28:32.021
- Tre.
- Come on, come on, come on.

719
00:28:32.045 --> 00:28:33.213
What's going on over here?

720
00:28:33.297 --> 00:28:34.566
Hey, where's that
defense? Stop him.

721
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:35.632
- Go, go, go. Fuck you!

722
00:28:35.716 --> 00:28:37.301
Yes!
- Yes!

723
00:28:37.384 --> 00:28:38.844
God damn!

724
00:28:39.553 --> 00:28:41.263
Hey, where's the defense?

725
00:28:41.346 --> 00:28:42.598
What's going on over here?

726
00:28:42.681 --> 00:28:44.057
Yeah, yes, to the house, Tre.

727
00:28:44.141 --> 00:28:45.934
- Hell yeah!

728
00:28:46.018 --> 00:28:48.103
- Yes!

729
00:28:48.729 --> 00:28:50.105
Yes, sir! Quit it.

730
00:28:50.189 --> 00:28:52.149
Hey, Cherise, you sure
I ain't his daddy?

731
00:28:52.232 --> 00:28:53.233
You wish.

732
00:28:53.317 --> 00:28:54.526
Carl. Call that, Carl.

733
00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:55.986
I got a personal foul.

734
00:28:56.069 --> 00:28:57.905
Facemask on the offense.

735
00:28:57.988 --> 00:28:59.114
Thank you, Carl.

736
00:28:59.198 --> 00:29:00.532
15-yard penalty.
- Come on!

737
00:29:00.616 --> 00:29:02.826
- Replay third down.
- Ref, are you blind?

738
00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:04.453
It's okay, Tre. It's okay.

739
00:29:05.287 --> 00:29:06.788
I got unsportsmanlike conduct.

740
00:29:06.872 --> 00:29:08.373
- Oh, come on.
15-yard penalty.

741
00:29:08.457 --> 00:29:10.334
- I mean... Great job, Carl.

742
00:29:10.417 --> 00:29:12.377
Sometimes the ref is the MVP.

743
00:29:13.545 --> 00:29:15.214
Bro got a Mickey Mouse voice.

744
00:29:15.297 --> 00:29:16.715
Fifty bucks, he hasn't even

745
00:29:16.798 --> 00:29:18.800
- dropped his balls yet.

746
00:29:18.884 --> 00:29:20.177
Drop this!

747
00:29:22.721 --> 00:29:23.805
Hey!

748
00:29:23.889 --> 00:29:25.140
What the fuck is you all doing?

749
00:29:25.224 --> 00:29:26.517
Hey! What is going on

750
00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:27.726
- over here? Fight!

751
00:29:27.809 --> 00:29:29.895
All right. See,
that's what happens

752
00:29:29.978 --> 00:29:31.480
when you get
Two-J's. Great job.

753
00:29:31.563 --> 00:29:32.689
- Fuck! I need my inhaler.

754
00:29:32.773 --> 00:29:33.982
Gary!

755
00:29:34.066 --> 00:29:36.401
Absolute abomination. Okay?

756
00:29:36.485 --> 00:29:37.861
But Two-J's got 'em doin'

757
00:29:37.945 --> 00:29:39.422
the same thing that
they would be doing

758
00:29:39.446 --> 00:29:41.782
on the block right
here on the field.

759
00:29:41.865 --> 00:29:43.033
You a bitch, Chip!

760
00:29:43.367 --> 00:29:44.761
That's it, that's it.
I'm calling the game.

761
00:29:44.785 --> 00:29:46.703
Oh, come on, ref! Nobody
even fuckin' bleed!

762
00:29:46.787 --> 00:29:48.705
That ain't the...

763
00:29:49.164 --> 00:29:50.791
- God damn!

764
00:29:54.127 --> 00:29:55.128
Fuck!

765
00:29:56.213 --> 00:29:59.341
Great job out there. I
know, tough circumstances.

766
00:29:59.424 --> 00:30:01.385
<i>This is why you can't have</i>

767
00:30:01.468 --> 00:30:04.721
<i>an egotistical maniac
coaching peewee football.</i>

768
00:30:04.805 --> 00:30:07.140
"Hashtag, worst
role model ever."

769
00:30:08.559 --> 00:30:10.310
Be very careful with Two-J's.

770
00:30:10.394 --> 00:30:12.437
Guy's got gonorrhea
again. Don't touch him,

771
00:30:12.521 --> 00:30:13.921
- no hugging. All
right? Definitely.

772
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.403
Well, congratulations,
you little assholes.

773
00:30:19.486 --> 00:30:20.838
Got me looking like
a straight mark

774
00:30:20.862 --> 00:30:22.114
in front of the whole Internet.

775
00:30:22.197 --> 00:30:23.657
Bruh, they ain't even had beef!

776
00:30:24.616 --> 00:30:25.784
Man, I'm out this bitch.

777
00:30:25.867 --> 00:30:27.411
- Excuse me?
- I'm done listening

778
00:30:27.494 --> 00:30:29.204
to some washed-up
loser, has-been coach.

779
00:30:29.288 --> 00:30:30.431
Fuck you say to
me, little nigga?

780
00:30:30.455 --> 00:30:31.582
- Jaycen! You heard me.

781
00:30:31.665 --> 00:30:32.916
Go, go wait by the car.

782
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.294
Kid got a real fuckin'
attitude problem.

783
00:30:35.377 --> 00:30:37.546
What the fuck is wrong with you?

784
00:30:37.629 --> 00:30:40.090
These little kids already have
the world bringing them down,

785
00:30:40.173 --> 00:30:41.453
they don't need
you doing it too.

786
00:30:41.883 --> 00:30:43.803
You really think you're
better than everyone else

787
00:30:43.885 --> 00:30:45.613
because you played for a
professional sports team

788
00:30:45.637 --> 00:30:46.847
over two decades ago?

789
00:30:47.264 --> 00:30:48.682
It's like ever since you made

790
00:30:48.765 --> 00:30:50.475
that stupid Hail Mary
catch in high school,

791
00:30:50.559 --> 00:30:52.185
you've turned your
back on everybody

792
00:30:52.269 --> 00:30:53.604
who ever helped you. Fuck you.

793
00:30:53.687 --> 00:30:55.355
Helped me? Shit.

794
00:30:55.439 --> 00:30:57.024
Ain't nobody help me!

795
00:30:57.107 --> 00:30:59.651
I'm Jaycen Jennings. I
don't owe nobody shit.

796
00:31:00.485 --> 00:31:01.612
I'm self-made!

797
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:30.015
Man.
- Man, I love you, Coach.

798
00:31:30.098 --> 00:31:31.099
I love you too, son.

799
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:32.893
Way to go, superstar.

800
00:31:32.976 --> 00:31:34.478
- We did it.
- We did it.

801
00:31:34.561 --> 00:31:35.771
You did it.

802
00:31:38.982 --> 00:31:40.359
Jaycen?

803
00:31:42.361 --> 00:31:43.570
What up, Coach Feis?

804
00:31:44.363 --> 00:31:46.365
Jaycen-goddamn-Jennings.

805
00:31:46.448 --> 00:31:49.534
Oh, man, good to see you,
kid. It's been way too long.

806
00:31:49.618 --> 00:31:51.453
Yeah, it has been
a minute, right?

807
00:31:51.536 --> 00:31:53.497
It's been... 20 years, Jaycen.

808
00:31:53.997 --> 00:31:56.375
Jaycen? What happened
to "superstar," Coach?

809
00:31:56.458 --> 00:31:57.751
What's that?

810
00:31:57.834 --> 00:31:59.294
Coach, you used to
call me superstar.

811
00:31:59.836 --> 00:32:00.879
Did I? Hmm.

812
00:32:00.962 --> 00:32:02.339
Coach, are you okay?

813
00:32:02.422 --> 00:32:04.102
Yeah, I'm all right.
What's wrong with you?

814
00:32:05.175 --> 00:32:07.552
Get your ass in here, why
would I call you superstar?

815
00:32:07.636 --> 00:32:09.280
What's all those F's
on your tracksuit for?

816
00:32:09.304 --> 00:32:11.556
- Reminds me of my report card.

817
00:32:19.272 --> 00:32:21.817
God damn, Coach,

818
00:32:22.859 --> 00:32:25.445
this shit is exactly the
way it was when I was here.

819
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:27.256
Coach, you ain't
never really thought

820
00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.157
about, like,
upgrading your shit?

821
00:32:29.616 --> 00:32:30.826
No.

822
00:32:30.909 --> 00:32:31.910
Like your TV.

823
00:32:31.993 --> 00:32:34.037
This is a Zenith. The desk.

824
00:32:34.121 --> 00:32:35.414
This raggedy-ass couch.

825
00:32:35.497 --> 00:32:36.748
I love that couch.

826
00:32:36.832 --> 00:32:38.192
Come on, Coach, I
used to cut class

827
00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:39.835
and take naps on that
couch right there.

828
00:32:39.918 --> 00:32:41.002
Look at it now.

829
00:32:41.294 --> 00:32:43.630
Duct tape on it, books
holding up as a leg,

830
00:32:43.714 --> 00:32:44.840
the shit is a mess.

831
00:32:45.757 --> 00:32:46.925
You know what I think, Coach?

832
00:32:47.342 --> 00:32:49.761
I think I should make a
phone call to Italy 2000

833
00:32:49.845 --> 00:32:51.596
and get you a brand-new
couch up in here.

834
00:32:52.973 --> 00:32:54.413
Get you spooned and
groomed one time.

835
00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.994
No, no, forget about
that. What about you?

836
00:32:57.018 --> 00:32:58.578
What you been up to
these past 20 years?

837
00:32:58.603 --> 00:32:59.604
Shit.

838
00:33:00.105 --> 00:33:01.815
Honestly, I'm here

839
00:33:01.898 --> 00:33:03.658
because I don't know
what the fuck I'm doin'.

840
00:33:05.277 --> 00:33:06.319
That I see.

841
00:33:06.403 --> 00:33:08.697
"I see"? Come on, Coach.

842
00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:11.032
Now, you know, you the
only role model in my life.

843
00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.344
Do you remember
what you were like

844
00:33:13.368 --> 00:33:14.453
when you showed up here

845
00:33:14.536 --> 00:33:16.830
first practice of freshman year?

846
00:33:16.913 --> 00:33:18.874
I don't know, like a
baller from the jump,

847
00:33:18.957 --> 00:33:20.125
a diamond in the rough?

848
00:33:20.208 --> 00:33:22.085
Man, you were a pain in the ass.

849
00:33:22.169 --> 00:33:23.479
Come on, Coach,
see, that kinda talk

850
00:33:23.503 --> 00:33:24.605
with you just
dragging me like that,

851
00:33:24.629 --> 00:33:25.869
how am I gonna buy you a couch?

852
00:33:25.922 --> 00:33:27.442
You know what, Jaycen,
I appreciate it,

853
00:33:27.466 --> 00:33:29.068
but you know what, get
off my couch, man. Fuck.

854
00:33:29.092 --> 00:33:30.302
Hundreds of my players

855
00:33:30.385 --> 00:33:31.612
have sat on that
couch right there,

856
00:33:31.636 --> 00:33:32.846
and they've come in here

857
00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:34.490
and they've talked to
me about their lives

858
00:33:34.514 --> 00:33:35.974
and their dreams
and their goals.

859
00:33:36.057 --> 00:33:38.518
And you know better than anyone

860
00:33:38.602 --> 00:33:39.936
that kids from this area,

861
00:33:40.729 --> 00:33:42.397
they're underdogs in the world.

862
00:33:42.481 --> 00:33:45.734
They grow up with not
one advantage in life.

863
00:33:45.817 --> 00:33:47.986
And sometimes, that
door being open,

864
00:33:48.069 --> 00:33:50.197
and that old couch right there,

865
00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.616
might've been the only safe
haven that those kids had.

866
00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:54.719
So, when you come and talk to me

867
00:33:54.743 --> 00:33:56.578
about buying me a
new couch, yeah,

868
00:33:56.661 --> 00:33:58.079
all right, maybe I
need a new couch,

869
00:33:58.163 --> 00:33:59.998
because that one's
getting a little worn out.

870
00:34:00.081 --> 00:34:03.627
But, to me, I'd prefer to
give that couch a little TLC.

871
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:05.504
- Just a little love.
- Oh, shit!

872
00:34:06.087 --> 00:34:07.547
Oh, shit!

873
00:34:07.631 --> 00:34:11.343
You Jedi mind-tricking
mothafucka, you, Coach.

874
00:34:11.426 --> 00:34:12.511
I got it!

875
00:34:12.594 --> 00:34:14.262
You tellin' me that just because

876
00:34:14.346 --> 00:34:15.806
the kids that I'm coachin',

877
00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:19.059
they may be raggedy and rough
around the edges and shit...

878
00:34:19.142 --> 00:34:20.685
Wait a minute, man,
you're coaching?

879
00:34:20.769 --> 00:34:23.146
But they require TLC.

880
00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:26.233
And if I provide TLC,
they can be just as good

881
00:34:26.316 --> 00:34:27.651
as any team that's out there,

882
00:34:27.734 --> 00:34:29.820
and that is the key

883
00:34:29.903 --> 00:34:32.030
to becomin' a
mothafuckin' role model.

884
00:34:32.113 --> 00:34:33.740
I get you. I got you.

885
00:34:33.824 --> 00:34:36.034
You the Gandhi of this
mothafuckin' coaching shit.

886
00:34:36.117 --> 00:34:38.161
That's all I needed,
inspiration. I'm out.

887
00:34:40.455 --> 00:34:42.582
THC is some shit. Wow.

888
00:34:44.084 --> 00:34:45.085
Crazy!

889
00:34:52.425 --> 00:34:53.677
He shouldn't even be here.

890
00:34:55.846 --> 00:34:57.514
I don't want nothing
to do with this guy.

891
00:34:57.597 --> 00:34:58.640
This guy sucks.

892
00:35:00.392 --> 00:35:01.560
Wassup, wassup?

893
00:35:03.728 --> 00:35:06.022
Oh, I see y'all little
angry about my tardiness.

894
00:35:06.773 --> 00:35:08.692
Had that sick feeling in
the pit of your stomach

895
00:35:08.775 --> 00:35:10.068
of being abandoned again?

896
00:35:10.151 --> 00:35:11.862
Yeah.
- Well, good.

897
00:35:12.487 --> 00:35:14.698
That's just the way I want
you little assholes to feel.

898
00:35:14.781 --> 00:35:16.199
Okay, what? Now, when I first

899
00:35:16.283 --> 00:35:18.201
started coaching this team,

900
00:35:18.285 --> 00:35:20.245
I ain't believe
in none of y'all.

901
00:35:20.328 --> 00:35:21.705
Not even a li'l bit.

902
00:35:22.205 --> 00:35:25.584
Until I got Jedi
mind-tricked into realizing

903
00:35:25.667 --> 00:35:27.627
that I underestimated y'all.

904
00:35:27.711 --> 00:35:29.337
Same way niggas did me.

905
00:35:30.297 --> 00:35:32.215
- See, we the same.

906
00:35:32.299 --> 00:35:33.508
We underdogs.

907
00:35:34.134 --> 00:35:35.635
The dog underneath the dog

908
00:35:35.719 --> 00:35:37.596
that's always getting
pissed and shitted on.

909
00:35:38.221 --> 00:35:39.657
- Where's he getting at?
- But today,

910
00:35:39.681 --> 00:35:41.391
I'm done pissing and
shitting on you kids.

911
00:35:42.309 --> 00:35:43.509
Now, when I look at y'all now,

912
00:35:44.561 --> 00:35:46.855
I don't see a bunch of assholes.

913
00:35:46.938 --> 00:35:49.649
I see me, in every
last one of y'all.

914
00:35:50.734 --> 00:35:52.211
It ain't no limits
to what y'all can do

915
00:35:52.235 --> 00:35:54.654
with Jaycen Jennings
on the sideline,

916
00:35:54.738 --> 00:35:57.532
coaching and actually
givin' a fuck.

917
00:35:59.492 --> 00:36:00.744
Don't know what that means.

918
00:36:01.745 --> 00:36:03.246
That's it?

919
00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:04.456
That's your big speech?

920
00:36:04.998 --> 00:36:06.249
So, you're just gonna

921
00:36:06.333 --> 00:36:08.293
stop peeing and pooping
all over us now?

922
00:36:09.252 --> 00:36:11.796
Because you remember that
you were an underdog?

923
00:36:12.797 --> 00:36:14.925
Well, couldn't have
said it better myself.

924
00:36:15.008 --> 00:36:16.426
Corny as hell.

925
00:36:16.509 --> 00:36:17.945
All right now, get your
asses up, let's warm up.

926
00:36:17.969 --> 00:36:19.012
Let's go.

927
00:36:19.304 --> 00:36:20.889
What y'all sitting
around for? Let's go!

928
00:36:20.972 --> 00:36:22.307
Yeah, little mothafuckers.

929
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:23.600
- Warm up. Who's that guy?

930
00:36:23.975 --> 00:36:25.995
When Coach say, "Warm up,"
warm this mothafucker up!

931
00:36:26.019 --> 00:36:27.437
Let's go, I'll pump that pistol

932
00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.000
- up in here. Come
on, get it. Go, go.

933
00:36:29.064 --> 00:36:30.565
Get it. You think it's a game?

934
00:36:30.649 --> 00:36:33.193
Boy, I'll lay your ass down
right up in here, right now.

935
00:36:33.276 --> 00:36:36.613
I will clear this whole
mothafuckin' field out.

936
00:36:36.696 --> 00:36:38.323
Go, go, go, go.
- Kareem?

937
00:36:38.406 --> 00:36:40.367
Hey, what's up, Cherise, baby?

938
00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:42.786
Kareem, the fuck is
you doin' here, man?

939
00:36:42.869 --> 00:36:44.847
Hey, I know you say you ain't
want me up here coaching

940
00:36:44.871 --> 00:36:46.331
on a official capacity.

941
00:36:46.414 --> 00:36:47.499
But you know what I mean?

942
00:36:47.791 --> 00:36:49.101
I'm over here lingering
in the periphial.

943
00:36:49.125 --> 00:36:50.377
You feel me, cuz.

944
00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:51.812
You hear me, I just
wanted to come up here

945
00:36:51.836 --> 00:36:53.171
and drop a few of
them little gems

946
00:36:53.254 --> 00:36:54.839
on the knowledge that I have

947
00:36:54.923 --> 00:36:56.216
of the game. Hold up a minute.

948
00:36:56.299 --> 00:36:57.926
Man, you look like
you got a Pamper on!

949
00:36:58.009 --> 00:36:59.302
Pick that shit up!

950
00:36:59.386 --> 00:37:01.096
This how you gotta talk to 'em.

951
00:37:01.179 --> 00:37:03.264
Hey, Cherise, are
you single, baby?

952
00:37:03.348 --> 00:37:04.557
Oh.

953
00:37:04.641 --> 00:37:06.351
Oh, man.

954
00:37:06.434 --> 00:37:09.104
Nah, I'm just kidding, I
know my man, J, tryna smash.

955
00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.523
Check it out.

956
00:37:11.606 --> 00:37:13.233
This book right here

957
00:37:13.316 --> 00:37:15.360
gonna have y'all running
schemes like a pro.

958
00:37:15.443 --> 00:37:17.404
Yo, you don't got no
trick plays up in here?

959
00:37:17.487 --> 00:37:19.614
We don't need no
goddamn trick plays.

960
00:37:19.698 --> 00:37:20.949
But they're so fun.

961
00:37:21.032 --> 00:37:22.426
Trick plays are
dope as fuck though.

962
00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:24.661
I like trick
plays. I really do,

963
00:37:24.744 --> 00:37:26.162
I love 'em. I
love trick plays.

964
00:37:26.246 --> 00:37:28.081
Man, how the fuck
you get a playbook?

965
00:37:28.164 --> 00:37:30.250
I'm just saying, ain't
no tables of contents

966
00:37:30.333 --> 00:37:32.293
- or nothing up in here, babe.
- Anyway,

967
00:37:32.794 --> 00:37:34.462
this book right
here took your boy,

968
00:37:34.546 --> 00:37:38.174
Jaycen Jennings, to
superstar, legendary status.

969
00:37:38.258 --> 00:37:40.885
You mean a washed-up loser
coaching peewee in Long Beach?

970
00:37:40.969 --> 00:37:42.303
Nah, I'm talking about the nigga

971
00:37:42.387 --> 00:37:44.347
that had your momma
before she had you.

972
00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:47.225
Now learn the goddamn playbook

973
00:37:47.308 --> 00:37:48.643
- and quit playin' so much.

974
00:37:48.727 --> 00:37:50.437
Hut. Go.

975
00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:53.690
Again. Till we get it right.

976
00:37:54.232 --> 00:37:55.692
We not movin' on
to the next play

977
00:37:55.775 --> 00:37:56.919
till y'all get this shit right.

978
00:37:56.943 --> 00:37:58.194
Hut.

979
00:38:01.406 --> 00:38:02.407
- God damn it, Tony. Hut.

980
00:38:05.368 --> 00:38:06.786
Hand me that football.

981
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:08.038
Oh, man.

982
00:38:08.371 --> 00:38:10.123
Hey, dawg, you ever
touched a titty before?

983
00:38:10.206 --> 00:38:11.666
- What?

984
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:13.519
A titty. Have you ever
touched a titty before...

985
00:38:13.543 --> 00:38:14.586
- Be quiet.

986
00:38:14.669 --> 00:38:15.962
You ever touch a titty before?

987
00:38:16.046 --> 00:38:17.130
Man, of course I have.

988
00:38:17.213 --> 00:38:19.257
So many titties, all sizes.

989
00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:20.717
A, triple A, double D.

990
00:38:21.551 --> 00:38:22.844
Man ain't never
touched no titty.

991
00:38:22.927 --> 00:38:24.429
Those are battery sizes.

992
00:38:24.512 --> 00:38:25.722
Man, yes, I have.

993
00:38:26.139 --> 00:38:27.450
Don't project your lack
of titty touching onto me.

994
00:38:27.474 --> 00:38:28.850
Come here, man,
let me talk to you.

995
00:38:30.435 --> 00:38:31.936
Look, this ball right here.

996
00:38:32.604 --> 00:38:33.646
That's your titty.

997
00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:34.856
You gotta hold it tight.

998
00:38:34.939 --> 00:38:36.441
'Cause everybody
wants your titty.

999
00:38:36.524 --> 00:38:38.109
Do I have consent of
touching the titty?

1000
00:38:38.193 --> 00:38:39.360
What you just say?

1001
00:38:39.444 --> 00:38:40.588
I'm not just gonna touch a titty

1002
00:38:40.612 --> 00:38:41.852
if it doesn't wanna be touched.

1003
00:38:42.447 --> 00:38:43.727
Touching titties without consent

1004
00:38:43.782 --> 00:38:46.076
got my cousin 30
days in the county.

1005
00:38:46.159 --> 00:38:47.202
Oh, that's nice.

1006
00:38:47.577 --> 00:38:48.912
- Get your ass outta here.

1007
00:38:48.995 --> 00:38:50.455
You got my consent, okay?

1008
00:38:50.538 --> 00:38:51.539
Nice!

1009
00:38:51.956 --> 00:38:53.249
Let's run it again.
Let's run it.

1010
00:38:53.666 --> 00:38:57.212
Hey, I like the titty thang,
keep the titty thang, cuz.

1011
00:38:57.921 --> 00:38:59.506
- Fuck up.
- Keep that titty thang, cuz.

1012
00:38:59.589 --> 00:39:01.749
Back in it. Back on line.
Come on, y'all, run it again.

1013
00:39:03.676 --> 00:39:05.804
The things you do in practice,
you'll do in the game.

1014
00:39:06.221 --> 00:39:07.472
If you're sorry at practice,

1015
00:39:07.555 --> 00:39:09.224
you're gonna be
sorry in the game.

1016
00:39:09.307 --> 00:39:10.683
Let's go, on the hop.

1017
00:39:11.392 --> 00:39:12.977
- The fuck was that?

1018
00:39:13.061 --> 00:39:14.104
Come on, get it right.

1019
00:39:14.187 --> 00:39:15.480
- Yo! Get it together.

1020
00:39:15.563 --> 00:39:17.565
- One more time. Again.

1021
00:39:17.649 --> 00:39:19.109
- God damn it. Oh!

1022
00:39:19.192 --> 00:39:20.652
No butter finger anymore.

1023
00:39:20.735 --> 00:39:22.153
- Ooh!

1024
00:39:22.237 --> 00:39:23.321
Oh!

1025
00:39:23.404 --> 00:39:24.906
- What the fuck?

1026
00:39:24.989 --> 00:39:27.283
That's why I can't
stand your little ass.

1027
00:39:27.367 --> 00:39:29.035
- Hey! Come on, defense.

1028
00:39:29.119 --> 00:39:30.387
Make it look like
something, let's go!

1029
00:39:30.411 --> 00:39:31.412
Hut.

1030
00:39:32.789 --> 00:39:34.374
Oh!

1031
00:39:34.457 --> 00:39:36.584
Little mothafucker came
outta nowhere like a ghost.

1032
00:39:36.668 --> 00:39:38.211
- Yeah! See right there?

1033
00:39:38.294 --> 00:39:39.563
Everybody on the team
need to be hitting

1034
00:39:39.587 --> 00:39:41.297
like this right here.

1035
00:39:41.381 --> 00:39:43.299
Hey, your new name is Ghost.

1036
00:39:43.925 --> 00:39:45.176
I see you in there.

1037
00:39:45.969 --> 00:39:47.488
Little homie, let me
talk to you, come here.

1038
00:39:47.512 --> 00:39:49.430
Let's huddle up,
little mothafuckers.

1039
00:39:49.514 --> 00:39:51.224
Look, you can't be the
tiniest mothafucker

1040
00:39:51.307 --> 00:39:53.476
on the team and
the softest, man.

1041
00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:55.103
Quick question, real quick.

1042
00:39:55.186 --> 00:39:56.831
Who's your favorite
character on <i>Game of Thrones?</i>

1043
00:39:56.855 --> 00:39:58.273
Wait, what?

1044
00:39:58.356 --> 00:40:00.275
Do you like the midget
who drinks the wine?

1045
00:40:00.358 --> 00:40:02.235
The tall blonde with the sword?

1046
00:40:02.318 --> 00:40:03.987
Or the sister-fucker
with the iron hand?

1047
00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:05.405
Oh, my God!

1048
00:40:05.488 --> 00:40:07.088
- Coach, you're a fan...
- Uh-uh-uh-uh...

1049
00:40:07.991 --> 00:40:09.993
Shut the fuck up. It's
between me and you.

1050
00:40:10.076 --> 00:40:12.495
Oh. Yeah, yeah. Sorry, sorry.

1051
00:40:12.579 --> 00:40:14.789
I feel like I've always had
a thing for the dragons.

1052
00:40:14.873 --> 00:40:16.124
So, I guess Drogon.

1053
00:40:16.207 --> 00:40:17.917
Yeah, definitely Drogon.

1054
00:40:18.001 --> 00:40:19.521
He's so badass and
everyone's afraid...

1055
00:40:19.878 --> 00:40:21.438
That's what I'm looking
for right there.

1056
00:40:21.462 --> 00:40:22.742
You take that
spirit to the field

1057
00:40:22.797 --> 00:40:24.132
and you go full-on Drogon.

1058
00:40:24.215 --> 00:40:25.901
I want you flying around
and burning up shit,

1059
00:40:25.925 --> 00:40:28.261
and make 'em respect your
fire-breathing dragon ass.

1060
00:40:28.344 --> 00:40:31.014
- You hear me?
- Yes, Coach!

1061
00:40:32.098 --> 00:40:34.017
I don't know what kinda
inspirational bullshit

1062
00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:35.602
y'all working on over there,

1063
00:40:35.685 --> 00:40:38.188
but his goofy, nerdy ass
gonna always be a bitch.

1064
00:40:38.271 --> 00:40:39.814
Tre, I'm fuckin' you up.

1065
00:40:39.898 --> 00:40:41.232
- Come on, run it. Run it.

1066
00:40:41.316 --> 00:40:43.151
Hey, pick it up, you
little fat mothafucker,

1067
00:40:43.234 --> 00:40:44.235
pick it up!

1068
00:40:44.319 --> 00:40:45.486
Damn.

1069
00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:47.322
- You not going pro.

1070
00:40:47.405 --> 00:40:48.698
Right now you sorry.

1071
00:40:49.157 --> 00:40:51.743
I'm sorry I'm coaching you
sorry mothafuckers. Let's go.

1072
00:40:53.203 --> 00:40:55.079
If the ball hits your hand,

1073
00:40:55.163 --> 00:40:57.248
you're supposed to pick it
up. Y'all know the rule.

1074
00:40:57.332 --> 00:40:58.458
Yell bingo on the pick.

1075
00:40:58.541 --> 00:40:59.959
Go!

1076
00:41:00.043 --> 00:41:01.628
Oh, pick that up. Oh!

1077
00:41:01.711 --> 00:41:03.463
God damn it, sticky fingers.

1078
00:41:03.546 --> 00:41:05.089
Run it one more
time. Let me see

1079
00:41:05.173 --> 00:41:06.859
if this mothafucker can
get it right. Let's go.

1080
00:41:06.883 --> 00:41:08.760
Let's make a play, pretty boy.

1081
00:41:08.843 --> 00:41:09.987
Come on, what the fuck is that?

1082
00:41:10.011 --> 00:41:11.512
Hey, pretty boy!

1083
00:41:11.596 --> 00:41:12.722
- You! Me?

1084
00:41:12.805 --> 00:41:13.890
Bring your ass over here!

1085
00:41:14.474 --> 00:41:16.476
You missing pass after pass,

1086
00:41:16.559 --> 00:41:17.977
you got on all this
sweet-ass shit.

1087
00:41:18.061 --> 00:41:19.354
I dig this.

1088
00:41:19.437 --> 00:41:21.189
You know what, every

that swag you got on.

1090
00:41:23.274 --> 00:41:24.567
And come to think of it,

1091
00:41:24.651 --> 00:41:26.319

1092
00:41:26.402 --> 00:41:27.796
but you the only mothafucker

1093
00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:28.947
- Me? Yeah, you.

1094
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:30.132
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

1095
00:41:30.156 --> 00:41:31.491
Well, we know what

1096
00:41:31.574 --> 00:41:32.635
- you talkin' about. Yeah!
- Hey, hey, quit playin'.

1097
00:41:32.659 --> 00:41:33.802
Nah, ain't no "quit playin'."

1098
00:41:33.826 --> 00:41:35.054
The next time you come out here

1099
00:41:35.078 --> 00:41:36.621

1100
00:41:36.704 --> 00:41:38.790
and you can't back it
up out on the field,

1101
00:41:38.873 --> 00:41:40.593
we gonna kick your
little ass off the field.

1102
00:41:40.625 --> 00:41:42.102
- Ain't that right, Coach J?
- That's a fact.

1103
00:41:42.126 --> 00:41:43.562
You outta here. Now
get on over there, man.

1104
00:41:43.586 --> 00:41:44.796
Damn!

1105
00:41:44.879 --> 00:41:46.599
Stop acting like you
got a album coming out!

1106
00:41:47.006 --> 00:41:48.341
Bingo.

1107
00:41:48.424 --> 00:41:49.842
- Come here, something else.

1108
00:41:49.926 --> 00:41:51.886
- Bring that shit to
me. Run it, run it.

1109
00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:53.197
Took a long time
putting this shit on,

1110
00:41:53.221 --> 00:41:54.347
now take it off.

1111
00:41:54.639 --> 00:41:56.182

00:41:57.976 --> 00:41:59.143
Come on, whip out of 'em.

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:00.687

00:42:05.566 --> 00:42:07.485

00:42:13.449 --> 00:42:14.969
I'mma take them beads out his
mothafuckin' head next time.

1124
00:42:14.993 --> 00:42:17.495
Let's go. With your
Stevie-Wonder-looking ass.

1125
00:42:21.124 --> 00:42:22.250
Hey!

1126
00:42:22.333 --> 00:42:23.710
- Jaycen.
- What up?

1127
00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:26.379
A few of the kids
need a ride home.

1128
00:42:26.462 --> 00:42:28.923
Any way I can trust you
to get them home safely?

1129
00:42:29.007 --> 00:42:31.175
No fucking way. I'm not finna

1130
00:42:31.259 --> 00:42:32.736
have those little
dirty-ass booger eaters

1131
00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.429
fuckin' up my midnight
black leather.

1132
00:42:34.512 --> 00:42:36.347
Jaycen, I have to go to work.

1133
00:42:36.431 --> 00:42:38.891
And your players
need their coach

1134
00:42:38.975 --> 00:42:40.268
to give them a ride home.

1135
00:42:40.685 --> 00:42:42.228
Can you do that,

1136
00:42:42.312 --> 00:42:43.313
Coach?

1137
00:42:43.896 --> 00:42:46.399
Sure. Anything
for the children.

1138
00:42:47.859 --> 00:42:50.320
Fuck that leather.
It's only cow, right?

1139
00:42:51.237 --> 00:42:52.322
Yep.

1140
00:42:52.405 --> 00:42:53.406
Yep.

1141
00:42:57.577 --> 00:43:00.121
You got this grandpa
black interior?

1142
00:43:00.204 --> 00:43:02.290
- This shit is trash.

1143
00:43:02.373 --> 00:43:04.625
Yo, Coach, you dropping
me off first, right?

1144
00:43:04.709 --> 00:43:05.752
I gotta piss.

1145
00:43:05.835 --> 00:43:07.295
Nah, forget that. Hold it.

1146
00:43:07.378 --> 00:43:08.379
I can't.

1147
00:43:09.088 --> 00:43:11.382
'Cause you got a
little-ass dick.

1148
00:43:11.466 --> 00:43:13.026
Hey! What's that gotta
do with anything?

1149
00:43:13.634 --> 00:43:15.446
The bigger your dick, the
longer you can hold it.

1150
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:16.804
That makes sense to me.

1151
00:43:16.888 --> 00:43:19.307
I'm pretty sure that's
not how penises work.

1152
00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:21.225
Hey, hey, hey, enough
with that shit, man.

1153
00:43:21.309 --> 00:43:23.162
That's all y'all wanna talk
about is dicks and shit.

1154
00:43:23.186 --> 00:43:24.937
Shut the fuck up and
talk about some girls

1155
00:43:25.021 --> 00:43:26.564
or fuckin' cartoons
or something.

1156
00:43:27.732 --> 00:43:28.858
Little dick say what?

1157
00:43:28.941 --> 00:43:30.818
- What?
- You said what.

1158
00:43:30.902 --> 00:43:33.196
- We got him.

1159
00:43:33.279 --> 00:43:34.548
That's the oldest
trick in the book.

1160
00:43:34.572 --> 00:43:35.823
Okay.

1161
00:43:35.907 --> 00:43:38.201
With your <i>Squid
Game</i> lookin' ass.

1162
00:43:38.284 --> 00:43:39.535
All right, see you later, Tony.

1163
00:43:39.619 --> 00:43:40.661
See you, guys. Bye, Tony.

1164
00:43:40.745 --> 00:43:42.163
See ya.
- Hey, Tony.

1165
00:43:42.246 --> 00:43:43.807
You're gonna just leave
your shit in my car?

1166
00:43:43.831 --> 00:43:45.917
Uh, I'll just pick it up
from you next practice.

1167
00:43:46.334 --> 00:43:47.627
- See you, Coach.

1168
00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:49.087
- What was that about?

1169
00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:51.172
His parents think he
at Mathletes practice.

1170
00:43:51.255 --> 00:43:52.632
What the fuck is a Mathlete?

1171
00:43:52.715 --> 00:43:54.884
Only the coolest
after-school club

1172
00:43:54.967 --> 00:43:57.303
with the cleverest
play on words ever.

1173
00:43:58.721 --> 00:44:00.098
I hate you so much.

1174
00:44:00.181 --> 00:44:02.725
Hate the player. Wait,
no. Hate the game.

1175
00:44:02.809 --> 00:44:03.994
Hate the player, not the game.

1176
00:44:04.018 --> 00:44:05.686
Not the game.

1177
00:44:08.439 --> 00:44:11.234
Thanks for the ride. Hey,
it's cool right here.

1178
00:44:11.317 --> 00:44:13.277
My house is, like,
right down the street.

1179
00:44:13.778 --> 00:44:15.255
Come on, Dwayne,
it's raining outside.

1180
00:44:15.279 --> 00:44:16.673
I can't leave you
out here like that.

1181
00:44:16.697 --> 00:44:17.907
Nah, nah, it's cool.

1182
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:20.118
I'mma just, um, pop up in there

1183
00:44:20.201 --> 00:44:21.828

Okay.

1185
00:44:25.123 --> 00:44:27.291
All right. You get that.

1186
00:44:36.134 --> 00:44:37.861
<i>And we lit tonight, don't
worry 'bout tomorrow</i>

1187
00:44:37.885 --> 00:44:39.929
<i>When she with me, she feel

1188
00:44:40.012 --> 00:44:41.973
<i>And when I walk out, the
tings, they gon' follow</i>

1189
00:44:42.056 --> 00:44:43.349
<i>- Bitch, I'm the - Best</i>

1190
00:44:43.433 --> 00:44:46.436

You got pro caliber plays.

1198
00:45:00.366 --> 00:45:02.410
A hell of a coach/role model.

1199
00:45:02.493 --> 00:45:04.287
And now...

1200
00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:06.998
you got these.

1201
00:45:07.373 --> 00:45:08.708
Hey, that's crazy!

1202
00:45:08.791 --> 00:45:11.461
Look at those helmets.
- Whoa!

1203
00:45:13.045 --> 00:45:15.339
Yeah, $10,000 jerseys for y'all.

1204
00:45:15.423 --> 00:45:16.757
Are you tryna buy us off now?

1205
00:45:17.884 --> 00:45:19.594
- Shit, I ain't mad
at it. Thank you.

1206
00:45:20.052 --> 00:45:21.053
Drogon.

1207
00:45:21.554 --> 00:45:23.097
Ooh!
- House of Dragons style.

1208
00:45:23.181 --> 00:45:24.640
- No way! Pretty boy.

1209
00:45:25.183 --> 00:45:26.392
Now you look the part

1210
00:45:26.476 --> 00:45:27.703
- and you can play the part.
- Okay.

1211
00:45:27.727 --> 00:45:28.978
My favorite, Titties.

1212
00:45:29.937 --> 00:45:32.356
- The mysterious Ghost.

1213
00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.525
And this one for you, Superstar.

1214
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:36.736
And let's see who else we got.

1215
00:45:37.361 --> 00:45:40.698
So, is there a reason
why the word "Underdoggs"

1216
00:45:40.781 --> 00:45:42.366
has two Gs in it?

1217
00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:43.451
Two Gs?

1218
00:45:43.743 --> 00:45:44.994
Yeah!

1219
00:45:45.077 --> 00:45:46.329
- I got the two Gs right here.

1220
00:45:46.412 --> 00:45:47.413
Shit!

1221
00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:52.251
- Meet Killa and Skrilla!

1222
00:45:52.335 --> 00:45:54.670
Two dogs for two
Gs. You get it?

1223
00:45:54.754 --> 00:45:56.464
Kareem, what the
fuck is you doing?

1224
00:45:56.547 --> 00:45:57.798
I found 'em chained up

1225
00:45:57.882 --> 00:45:59.467
in the back of the
Wienerschnitzel.

1226
00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:00.885
Get these fuckin'
dogs outta here,

1227
00:46:00.968 --> 00:46:01.969
I'm tryna coach football.

1228
00:46:02.053 --> 00:46:03.763
The dogs like football too.

1229
00:46:03.846 --> 00:46:05.723
- Man, have a heart.

1230
00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.894
<i>I'm a Champion all day, born
this way, what about you?</i>

1231
00:46:09.977 --> 00:46:12.939
<i>I'm a Champion all day, born
this way, what about you?</i>

1232
00:46:13.022 --> 00:46:16.275
<i>I'm a Champion all day, born
this way, what about you?</i>

1233
00:46:16.984 --> 00:46:19.529
Mm-hmm. That's what
I'm talking about.

1234
00:46:19.612 --> 00:46:21.072
Look the part,
you play the part.

1235
00:46:21.155 --> 00:46:23.074
The way y'all look right
now, I see no excuse

1236
00:46:23.157 --> 00:46:24.637
for the Underdoggs
not to go out there

1237
00:46:24.742 --> 00:46:26.428
and get our first mothafuckin'
win of the season.

1238
00:46:26.452 --> 00:46:28.496
Yeah! Yeah!

1239
00:46:28.579 --> 00:46:31.082
Let's go. Underdoggs, on me,
"Underdoggs" on three. One...

1240
00:46:31.165 --> 00:46:32.625
Let's just get that
shit over with.

1241
00:46:32.708 --> 00:46:34.544
Damn, I'mma have to
carry your asses anyway.

1242
00:46:34.627 --> 00:46:36.337
Hater.

1243
00:46:39.131 --> 00:46:40.341
Let's make a play.

1244
00:46:40.841 --> 00:46:42.969
Do you understand what
you got goin' on here?

1245
00:46:43.594 --> 00:46:45.304
- We are fuckin' losers.
- Hey!

1246
00:46:45.388 --> 00:46:46.389
Losers. Hut!

1247
00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:49.767
- Get it off!
Get it off! Here!

1248
00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:51.227
Get it off! Let it go!

1249
00:46:52.562 --> 00:46:54.355
- What are you doing?
Throw the ball!

1250
00:46:54.438 --> 00:46:56.607
Stop being a fuckin'
hotdog, throw the ball.

1251
00:46:58.442 --> 00:46:59.670
What the hell's wrong with you?

1252
00:46:59.694 --> 00:47:01.362
Your daddy should've pulled out.

1253
00:47:01.445 --> 00:47:02.572
- Coach, come on. Hut.

1254
00:47:02.655 --> 00:47:04.156
Yo, make the play, Gary.

1255
00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:05.616
What you doing?

1256
00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:07.159
- What you doing?
- God damn it!

1257
00:47:08.411 --> 00:47:10.204
Oh, my God! He did it again.

1258
00:47:10.746 --> 00:47:12.164
Here! Here! Hit that shit.

1259
00:47:12.582 --> 00:47:13.791
Throw the ball!

1260
00:47:13.874 --> 00:47:15.418
Give him the ball, Tre.

1261
00:47:15.501 --> 00:47:17.628
- Throw the goddamn
ball! Oh, man!

1262
00:47:17.712 --> 00:47:20.089
You're a hardheaded-ass
quarterback.

1263
00:47:21.716 --> 00:47:23.509
- Let's go, baby.
- Hey!

1264
00:47:23.593 --> 00:47:25.511
Come on, little asshole.
Run the goddamn play.

1265
00:47:25.595 --> 00:47:26.596
Set.

1266
00:47:27.805 --> 00:47:29.015
Hut!

1267
00:47:29.765 --> 00:47:32.184
Tony, hit that shit. God damn!

1268
00:47:32.268 --> 00:47:33.853
What the fuck is you doing, Tre?

1269
00:47:33.936 --> 00:47:35.396
I got him!

1270
00:47:35.479 --> 00:47:36.814
Fuck!

1271
00:47:36.897 --> 00:47:38.458
Hey, man. That was
supposed to be a handoff.

1272
00:47:38.482 --> 00:47:40.067
You think I'd ever
hand it off to you?

1273
00:47:40.151 --> 00:47:41.193
- Screw you! The fuck!

1274
00:47:41.694 --> 00:47:43.738
Get off me!

1275
00:47:43.821 --> 00:47:44.989
What're y'all doin'?

1276
00:47:46.866 --> 00:47:47.992
Fight for real, man!

1277
00:47:48.075 --> 00:47:49.076
Watch it!

1278
00:47:49.493 --> 00:47:50.745
- Come here, come
here. Back up!

1279
00:47:50.828 --> 00:47:52.038
What's your problem?

1280
00:47:52.121 --> 00:47:54.415
Get off of me! Let me go!

1281
00:47:54.498 --> 00:47:56.042
Bro, man, let me go.

1282
00:47:56.125 --> 00:47:58.103
This shit ends right here
and right mothafuckin' now.

1283
00:47:58.127 --> 00:47:59.605
I've been givin' your
little ass a pass

1284
00:47:59.629 --> 00:48:01.130
'cause you Cherise's
kid and all,

1285
00:48:01.213 --> 00:48:03.174
but you're making it
difficult as fuck right now

1286
00:48:03.257 --> 00:48:05.843
for me and your teammates,
and we sick of your shit.

1287
00:48:05.926 --> 00:48:07.011
Man, fuck you!

1288
00:48:07.094 --> 00:48:08.929
And my teammates, everybody!

1289
00:48:09.013 --> 00:48:10.723
I don't owe nobody shit.

1290
00:48:10.806 --> 00:48:12.058
I'm self-made.

1291
00:48:18.189 --> 00:48:19.565
You sound just like me.

1292
00:48:19.649 --> 00:48:20.900
I ain't nothing like you.

1293
00:48:20.983 --> 00:48:22.568
You're a washed-up loser.

1294
00:48:26.405 --> 00:48:27.990
Yeah. You're right.

1295
00:48:28.866 --> 00:48:29.867
I am.

1296
00:48:31.452 --> 00:48:33.287
You wanna know how
I became a loser?

1297
00:48:33.913 --> 00:48:36.874
By doing the same dumbass
shit you doing right now.

1298
00:48:39.335 --> 00:48:42.088
No wonder why nobody wanted
to fuckin' play with me.

1299
00:48:42.171 --> 00:48:44.048
Shit is fuckin' irritating.

1300
00:48:44.924 --> 00:48:46.467
You know something though, Tre?

1301
00:48:47.677 --> 00:48:49.178
If you really wanna win a game,

1302
00:48:49.845 --> 00:48:51.180
stop pushing away

1303
00:48:51.263 --> 00:48:53.182
all the mothafuckers
that's on your team.

1304
00:48:53.849 --> 00:48:56.602
But if you ultimately
wanna become a loser,

1305
00:48:57.895 --> 00:49:02.441
keep doing the same
dumbass shit that I did.

1306
00:49:28.175 --> 00:49:30.469
Remember when in Season
3, when Khaleesi burns

1307
00:49:30.553 --> 00:49:31.738
the slaver's village
to the ground?

1308
00:49:31.762 --> 00:49:33.055
What is he talking about?

1309
00:49:33.139 --> 00:49:34.849
Oh, my God. You're a fan?

1310
00:49:34.932 --> 00:49:37.143
Make them bend their
mothafuckin' knee.

1311
00:49:38.686 --> 00:49:39.687
All right?

1312
00:49:40.187 --> 00:49:41.605
And you,

1313
00:49:41.689 --> 00:49:42.940
take care of that titty.

1314
00:49:43.023 --> 00:49:44.292
- Yeah, your titty,
man. All right?

1315
00:49:44.316 --> 00:49:45.419
"Underdoggs" on three.
One, two, three.

1316
00:49:45.443 --> 00:49:46.652
- Underdoggs! Underdoggs!

1317
00:49:48.696 --> 00:49:50.156
- Come on, Tre.

1318
00:49:50.239 --> 00:49:51.907
Stop fighting. Run
the goddamn play.

1319
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:53.951
Set.

1320
00:49:54.577 --> 00:49:55.578
Down.

1321
00:49:55.953 --> 00:49:56.954
Hut!

1322
00:49:58.456 --> 00:49:59.999
<i>Dracarys!</i>

1323
00:50:01.542 --> 00:50:02.769
Good block, Gary!
- Yes, yes, yes!

1324
00:50:02.793 --> 00:50:04.253
Go, Tony, go!

1325
00:50:04.336 --> 00:50:05.629
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1326
00:50:05.713 --> 00:50:07.173
- Oh, oh. God damn it,

1327
00:50:07.256 --> 00:50:08.632
good move! Good shit, baby!

1328
00:50:11.135 --> 00:50:12.470
Whoo!

1329
00:50:12.553 --> 00:50:14.030
Hold them titties.
Tony, hold them titties.

1330
00:50:14.054 --> 00:50:15.723
This is my titty,
this is my titty!

1331
00:50:15.806 --> 00:50:17.325
- To the house, to the house!
- This is my titty!

1332
00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:18.535
- To the mothafuckin' house!
- This is my titty,

1333
00:50:18.559 --> 00:50:19.559
- this is my titty!

1334
00:50:19.602 --> 00:50:20.728
Yeah!
- Yeah!

1335
00:50:20.811 --> 00:50:21.937
Touchdown!

1336
00:50:22.438 --> 00:50:23.731
- Yes!
- Yeah!

1337
00:50:23.814 --> 00:50:25.733
That's what I'm
talking about, man.

1338
00:50:27.026 --> 00:50:28.778
Hey, hey, whoo,

1339
00:50:28.861 --> 00:50:31.697
- whoo, hee, hee, yay!
- The two Js?

1340
00:50:32.239 --> 00:50:34.366
Excessive celebration.

1341
00:50:34.450 --> 00:50:35.890
- 15-yard penalty...
- Fuck you, ref!

1342
00:50:36.076 --> 00:50:37.429
- Enforced on the kickoff.
- We don't give a fuck.

1343
00:50:37.453 --> 00:50:38.893
Underdoggs celebrate,
get used to it.

1344
00:50:38.954 --> 00:50:40.456
We'll be back. Let's go!

1345
00:50:41.373 --> 00:50:42.875
Yo, Tre, shake that shit!

1346
00:50:45.294 --> 00:50:46.837
- Yes, yes, go to the house!

1347
00:50:46.921 --> 00:50:48.339
Good shit! Yeah!

1348
00:50:48.923 --> 00:50:52.343
Hey, hey, hey!

1349
00:50:52.426 --> 00:50:53.636
Eff your flag. Let's go!

1350
00:50:55.471 --> 00:50:56.806
Good block. Yes, sir!

1351
00:50:58.265 --> 00:50:59.600
Make the play. Go!

1352
00:50:59.683 --> 00:51:00.935
- Let's go! Touchdown!

1353
00:51:02.353 --> 00:51:04.104
To the house! To the house!

1354
00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:05.773
Great run, Gary.

1355
00:51:07.733 --> 00:51:08.734
This is my titty!

1356
00:51:09.318 --> 00:51:10.903
- Way to go, Tony!

1357
00:51:10.986 --> 00:51:12.655
Touchdown! Fuck yeah!

1358
00:51:13.447 --> 00:51:16.700
That's what I'm talking about.
Teamwork make a dream work.

1359
00:51:19.078 --> 00:51:20.704
Good shit, Superstar.

1360
00:51:20.788 --> 00:51:22.373
Yeah!
- Yeah, whatever.

1361
00:51:22.456 --> 00:51:23.916
You're still a washed-up loser.

1362
00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:27.253
Come here.

1363
00:51:27.336 --> 00:51:29.088
Come here!

1364
00:51:29.171 --> 00:51:32.007
I used to run track, you know,
that's why you fast like that.

1365
00:51:41.851 --> 00:51:44.103
Good game today, Coach.
Thanks for the ride.

1366
00:51:45.187 --> 00:51:46.188
This cool.

1367
00:51:46.772 --> 00:51:47.940
Thanks, Coach.

1368
00:51:48.023 --> 00:51:49.775
I'mma just pop up
in here and cop

1369
00:51:49.859 --> 00:51:52.339
- me some new shoes real quick.
- Me some new shoes real quick.

1370
00:51:52.945 --> 00:51:54.238
Man, no, you not.

1371
00:51:55.406 --> 00:51:57.491
Hmm. You know, when
I was your age,

1372
00:51:58.033 --> 00:52:00.452
this store used to be 7-Eleven.

1373
00:52:00.536 --> 00:52:02.413
And every day the school
bus dropped me off,

1374
00:52:02.496 --> 00:52:03.998
I race up in that mothafucker,

1375
00:52:04.081 --> 00:52:06.001
get me some Swishers or
some condoms or whatever,

1376
00:52:06.333 --> 00:52:08.210
but I never actually
bought anything.

1377
00:52:08.919 --> 00:52:10.713
I was just puttin' on a front,

1378
00:52:10.796 --> 00:52:13.090
so nobody'd see me walkin' home

1379
00:52:13.173 --> 00:52:14.717
to that trailer park
around the corner.

1380
00:52:16.468 --> 00:52:18.053
The trailer park
around the corner?

1381
00:52:19.889 --> 00:52:21.140
Damn, I didn't even know that.

1382
00:52:21.223 --> 00:52:22.766
Come on, cuz, are you crazy?

1383
00:52:22.850 --> 00:52:24.369
You tell everybody on
the team that you gonna

1384
00:52:24.393 --> 00:52:25.873
get you a new pair
of shoes every day.

1385
00:52:26.979 --> 00:52:28.188
You think we don't recognize

1386
00:52:28.272 --> 00:52:29.815
when you never
show up with none?

1387
00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:33.569
All right, fine.

1388
00:52:34.445 --> 00:52:35.988
It's just...

1389
00:52:36.864 --> 00:52:39.617
It's kinda embarrassing
to be the brokest kid

1390
00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:41.577
on a team of broke-ass kids.

1391
00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:43.537
Ain't nothin' to be
embarrassed about.

1392
00:52:43.621 --> 00:52:45.706
The best underdog stories

1393
00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:49.209
start out just like me
and you. You feel me?

1394
00:52:51.503 --> 00:52:53.589
You used to live in
a trailer park too?

1395
00:52:53.672 --> 00:52:55.841
Lot 4, unit C.

1396
00:52:57.009 --> 00:52:58.010
That was me.

1397
00:53:01.764 --> 00:53:02.765
All right, Coach.

1398
00:53:03.515 --> 00:53:05.142
You can just take me home.

1399
00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:10.397
Nah, think I got a better idea.

1400
00:53:12.066 --> 00:53:14.068
Set! Hut! Let's go, let's go.

1401
00:53:14.151 --> 00:53:15.591
Let's go, let's go,
defense, lock up.

1402
00:53:16.612 --> 00:53:17.988
Defense! Bingo!

1403
00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:21.241
Pick that shit up, Dwayne,
to the mothafuckin' house!

1404
00:53:21.325 --> 00:53:22.576
- Yes!
- Go! Go! Go!

1405
00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:23.661
Yes! Yes!

1406
00:53:23.744 --> 00:53:24.745
- Yes!
- Yeah!

1407
00:53:24.828 --> 00:53:25.829
Yes, way to go, Dwayne!

1408
00:53:27.665 --> 00:53:29.291
Yeah! Pretty Boy!

1409
00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:32.795
<i>Turns out, bein' an incredible</i>

1410
00:53:32.878 --> 00:53:33.879
<i>- role model...</i>
- Yeah!

1411
00:53:34.546 --> 00:53:36.507
Well, that shit is
easy as a mothafucker.

1412
00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:38.676
Just be real about who you are,

1413
00:53:38.759 --> 00:53:41.387
<i>and suddenly all of
them kids you inspired,</i>

1414
00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:43.472
<i>they gonna show the
world who they really be.</i>

1415
00:53:43.555 --> 00:53:44.598
Tony?

1416
00:53:46.308 --> 00:53:48.102
Mom, Dad.

1417
00:53:48.185 --> 00:53:49.478
What are you guys doing here?

1418
00:53:49.561 --> 00:53:51.480
We just got a call from
a man named Jaycen.

1419
00:53:51.563 --> 00:53:54.024
He said he was your coach and
that you had a game today?

1420
00:53:59.279 --> 00:54:00.447
Fuck it.

1421
00:54:00.864 --> 00:54:02.342
I haven't been going to
Mathletes practice, okay?

1422
00:54:02.366 --> 00:54:04.243
I never even signed up
for that stupid club.

1423
00:54:04.785 --> 00:54:05.869
I play football.

1424
00:54:05.953 --> 00:54:07.204
I love football.

1425
00:54:07.287 --> 00:54:08.872
I'm actually pretty good at it.

1426
00:54:08.956 --> 00:54:11.333
Even though I still fumble,
which I'm improving on,

1427
00:54:11.417 --> 00:54:13.137
especially if I imagine
the ball is a titty.

1428
00:54:15.004 --> 00:54:17.006
I know you're super
mad at me right now,

1429
00:54:17.089 --> 00:54:19.216
but if you could just
not be and let me play,

1430
00:54:19.299 --> 00:54:21.051
that would be really dope, okay?

1431
00:54:23.262 --> 00:54:25.597
Are you still gonna get
straight A's in school?

1432
00:54:26.724 --> 00:54:27.725
Yeah.

1433
00:54:31.478 --> 00:54:33.814
Okay. Have fun.

1434
00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:38.444
<i>Inspired not to
be little bitches</i>

1435
00:54:38.527 --> 00:54:40.112
<i>in front of their parents.</i>

1436
00:54:40.195 --> 00:54:43.240
Does his jersey say "Titties"?

1437
00:54:44.742 --> 00:54:46.160
<i>Inspired to shock the world.</i>

1438
00:54:46.243 --> 00:54:47.745
Set! Hut!

1439
00:54:47.828 --> 00:54:49.747
Let's go, defense. Let's go!

1440
00:54:51.832 --> 00:54:53.083
Yes! Way to go, Ghost!

1441
00:54:53.667 --> 00:54:55.252
Go! Hit that shit!

1442
00:54:55.335 --> 00:54:57.171
- Yes! Good shit!

1443
00:54:58.380 --> 00:54:59.715
Make the play!

1444
00:54:59.798 --> 00:55:01.925
- Hit it, Ghost!

1445
00:55:02.009 --> 00:55:03.469
- Yes!

1446
00:55:06.263 --> 00:55:07.598
Get outta here!

1447
00:55:12.895 --> 00:55:15.147
- She's a girl!
- She's a girl.

1448
00:55:16.565 --> 00:55:18.150
Oh, shit!

1449
00:55:18.233 --> 00:55:19.318
Fantastic.

1450
00:55:19.401 --> 00:55:20.944
Gary! I love you, baby,

1451
00:55:21.028 --> 00:55:23.655
but Momma's got a new
favorite player. Yes, ma'am!

1452
00:55:25.491 --> 00:55:27.951
You can let your hair
down now, baby girl.

1453
00:55:28.035 --> 00:55:29.369
Yeah!

1454
00:55:32.748 --> 00:55:34.875
So, to all you selfish
assholes out there,

1455
00:55:35.334 --> 00:55:36.543
just keep it real.

1456
00:55:36.627 --> 00:55:38.128
And if you do that,

1457
00:55:38.212 --> 00:55:40.422
then you can become
an inspiration,

1458
00:55:41.131 --> 00:55:42.674
just like I did.

1459
00:55:44.176 --> 00:55:45.969
<i>Break out the food
and the drinks</i>

1460
00:55:46.053 --> 00:55:48.680

00:55:48.764 --> 00:55:50.974

1466

<i>Timing couldn't be better</i>

1483
00:56:44.945 --> 00:56:46.613
Here's my hot wheel collection.

1484
00:56:46.697 --> 00:56:47.948
Do you need to add a few more?

1485
00:56:48.031 --> 00:56:49.408
Probably about five or six more.

1486
00:56:49.491 --> 00:56:51.660
- Yeah, I would say so.

1487
00:56:51.743 --> 00:56:52.953
- I was kidding.
- Oh.

1488
00:56:54.121 --> 00:56:55.122
That...

1489
00:56:55.664 --> 00:56:56.832
Is that Big Shirley?

1490
00:56:56.915 --> 00:56:58.208
Yeah, you know damn well

1491
00:56:58.292 --> 00:56:59.519
I wasn't gonna get
rid of Big Shirley.

1492
00:56:59.543 --> 00:57:00.836
Wait, is it actually
the same car

1493
00:57:00.919 --> 00:57:02.119
from high school or did you...

1494
00:57:02.462 --> 00:57:06.008
It is the exact same car
that me and you used to...

1495
00:57:06.091 --> 00:57:07.426
Uh-huh. Yeah, I got it.

1496
00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:11.847
So many memories in this car.

1497
00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:13.265
Oh, wow.

1498
00:57:13.348 --> 00:57:14.558
Cherise, do you realize

1499
00:57:14.641 --> 00:57:16.476
this is the first
time in so many years

1500
00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:18.538
that me and you have actually
been in a room alone?

1501
00:57:18.562 --> 00:57:20.522
Don't be nasty now.

1502
00:57:20.606 --> 00:57:21.815
I'm just saying.

1503
00:57:21.899 --> 00:57:23.984
We can finally
talk. Get caught up.

1504
00:57:24.067 --> 00:57:26.403
Talk about the things
you've been doing.

1505
00:57:27.154 --> 00:57:29.448
You know, places you've been.

1506
00:57:29.531 --> 00:57:32.242
The men you've been with
after I broke up with you.

1507
00:57:34.828 --> 00:57:36.413
I still find it
hilarious to this day

1508
00:57:36.496 --> 00:57:38.040
that you think you
broke up with me.

1509
00:57:38.123 --> 00:57:39.124
'Cause I did.

1510
00:57:39.208 --> 00:57:40.500
You didn't though.

1511
00:57:40.584 --> 00:57:42.044
But, you know what,
you're too much

1512
00:57:42.127 --> 00:57:44.171
of a insufferable egomaniac
to admit it, so...

1513
00:57:44.254 --> 00:57:45.923
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

1514
00:57:46.006 --> 00:57:48.050
Okay. Hypothetically,

1515
00:57:48.133 --> 00:57:50.469
let's say if I was to say it
for the first time, out loud,

1516
00:57:51.345 --> 00:57:53.680
that you did actually
break up with me,

1517
00:57:54.681 --> 00:57:55.849
what would you say?

1518
00:58:01.271 --> 00:58:03.649
I'd say that was a
really hard time for me.

1519
00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:06.652
I was so proud of you

1520
00:58:06.735 --> 00:58:08.403
and everything you
accomplished, but

1521
00:58:09.529 --> 00:58:11.365
I had my own goals and dreams,

1522
00:58:11.448 --> 00:58:13.283
and I couldn't spend
the rest of my life

1523
00:58:13.367 --> 00:58:14.910
being your plus-one.

1524
00:58:15.744 --> 00:58:17.579
And for the record, I
told you all of that.

1525
00:58:18.497 --> 00:58:20.874
But all you just kept
saying was, I was...

1526
00:58:22.584 --> 00:58:24.419
jealous of your shine.

1527
00:58:26.004 --> 00:58:27.714
Which was, you know,

1528
00:58:28.548 --> 00:58:29.591
hurtful.

1529
00:58:32.636 --> 00:58:34.388
Hypothetically.

1530
00:58:38.809 --> 00:58:40.310
Anyways, um,

1531
00:58:41.687 --> 00:58:43.355
I really should go
check on the kids.

1532
00:58:50.237 --> 00:58:51.381
Hold on, watch this, watch this.

1533
00:58:51.405 --> 00:58:52.948
No, give me a second time.

1534
00:58:53.031 --> 00:58:55.151
One more time, one more time.
One more time, one more.

1535
00:58:57.077 --> 00:58:58.453
Ayo, Ghost, do we have to,

1536
00:58:58.537 --> 00:58:59.913
like, not use words like "bitch"

1537
00:58:59.997 --> 00:59:01.331
- when we're around you? Dude.

1538
00:59:01.415 --> 00:59:02.666
Or "titties," I mean,

1539
00:59:02.749 --> 00:59:04.227
I gotta be able to
say "titties," right?

1540
00:59:04.251 --> 00:59:06.044
Bro, you're making this
so weird right now.

1541
00:59:06.128 --> 00:59:08.189
You're makin' it weird by
sayin' I'm makin' it weird.

1542
00:59:08.213 --> 00:59:09.533
Yo, you are all
making this weird.

1543
00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:12.134
So, stop being
such bitches. Jeez.

1544
00:59:12.217 --> 00:59:13.927
- Who she say
that to? Whatever.

1545
00:59:14.011 --> 00:59:15.451
Man, nobody listens
to her, for real.

1546
00:59:16.638 --> 00:59:17.681
Yo, what's she doing?

1547
00:59:19.474 --> 00:59:21.393
Bro, she's drinking.

1548
00:59:22.436 --> 00:59:23.645
No way!

1549
00:59:23.729 --> 00:59:24.980
She just drunk it.

1550
00:59:25.063 --> 00:59:26.690
She's gonna end up
like Kareem, bro.

1551
00:59:30.902 --> 00:59:31.903
What?

1552
00:59:33.613 --> 00:59:35.157
Say what?

1553
01:00:03.226 --> 01:00:05.896
Cherise, let me holla
at you real quick.

1554
01:00:08.231 --> 01:00:09.649
Look,

1555
01:00:09.733 --> 01:00:11.485
I know this is probably
coming way too late,

1556
01:00:12.235 --> 01:00:13.945
but, um, just so you know,

1557
01:00:14.571 --> 01:00:16.114
every girl I was with after you,

1558
01:00:16.198 --> 01:00:17.949
I thought about
you the whole time.

1559
01:00:21.787 --> 01:00:22.788
That's disturbing.

1560
01:00:22.871 --> 01:00:24.122
And a little flattering.

1561
01:00:24.498 --> 01:00:25.665
No.

1562
01:00:25.749 --> 01:00:27.292
- Not even a little.

1563
01:00:27.876 --> 01:00:29.669
Nah, but, uh, either way,

1564
01:00:30.253 --> 01:00:31.254
I'm sorry.

1565
01:00:31.963 --> 01:00:34.549
For pushing you away
and not supporting you.

1566
01:00:35.425 --> 01:00:36.718
For real.

1567
01:00:36.802 --> 01:00:37.803
Thank you.

1568
01:00:39.179 --> 01:00:40.389
Means a lot.

1569
01:00:44.684 --> 01:00:45.977
- Questions.
- Mm-hmm.

1570
01:00:46.061 --> 01:00:47.354
Wha... Who is that?

1571
01:00:47.437 --> 01:00:48.814
That's Two-J's,
what do you mean?

1572
01:00:48.897 --> 01:00:50.649
- What? That's me, baby.

1573
01:00:50.732 --> 01:00:53.360
I mean, I don't remember
the booty being like...

1574
01:00:53.443 --> 01:00:55.320
What, that's me, what
are you talkin' about?

1575
01:00:55.404 --> 01:00:58.031
I mean, I wish. No, I mean...

1576
01:00:58.115 --> 01:00:59.550
You wish that my
thing was like that?

1577
01:00:59.574 --> 01:01:01.701
No, I mean, I
shouldn't even be...

1578
01:01:01.785 --> 01:01:02.786
Where are the kids?

1579
01:01:03.245 --> 01:01:04.996
Oh, I see a goldfish.

1580
01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.456
I'mma try and hit it.

1581
01:01:07.124 --> 01:01:09.668
Yo, watch your aim!
Oh, shit. My bad, bro.

1582
01:01:09.751 --> 01:01:11.128
Oh, my God!

1583
01:01:12.712 --> 01:01:15.298
I know y'all not pissin'
in my mothafuckin' pool

1584
01:01:15.382 --> 01:01:16.800
with y'all little drunk asses.

1585
01:01:16.883 --> 01:01:19.261
Everybody out the pool. Now!

1586
01:01:19.344 --> 01:01:21.114
You heard what she said,
get the fuck out my pool

1587
01:01:21.138 --> 01:01:22.740
- with your little drunk asses.
- I saw you peeing.

1588
01:01:22.764 --> 01:01:24.850
You're all grounded. I
expected way more. Way more.

1589
01:01:24.933 --> 01:01:26.726
Kareem, nigga, wake your ass up!

1590
01:01:26.810 --> 01:01:29.104
Ahhh! Sorry, Momma!

1591
01:01:29.187 --> 01:01:30.480
Cuz, the kids been drinkin'.

1592
01:01:31.106 --> 01:01:32.357
Come on, dawg, don't go there.

1593
01:01:32.441 --> 01:01:34.901
We used to dip our
blunts in lighter fluid.

1594
01:01:34.985 --> 01:01:36.319
That's basically PCP.

1595
01:01:36.403 --> 01:01:37.923
Don't go there,
talkin' 'bout "Kareem."

1596
01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:41.491
Their parents gonna
whoop their ass anyway.

1597
01:01:41.575 --> 01:01:43.243
<i>I wanna dedicate this episode</i>

1598
01:01:43.326 --> 01:01:45.162
<i>to the Honorable Judge Tara.</i>

1599
01:01:45.245 --> 01:01:47.122

1600
01:01:47.205 --> 01:01:48.623
<i>- Who knew my calling</i>

1601
01:01:48.707 --> 01:01:49.708
<i>even before I did.</i>

1602
01:01:49.791 --> 01:01:51.585
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1603
01:01:51.668 --> 01:01:53.003
<i>Who would've thought</i>

1604
01:01:53.462 --> 01:01:55.273
<i>that pickin' up dog shit
would be so enlightening.</i>

1605
01:01:55.297 --> 01:01:56.590
Looks like that bus

1606
01:01:56.673 --> 01:01:57.942
knocked some sense into
that head of yours.

1607
01:01:57.966 --> 01:01:59.468
Yeah! Take 'em out!

1608
01:01:59.551 --> 01:02:00.886
Go! Go!

1609
01:02:00.969 --> 01:02:02.679
- Weak-ass coaches.
- Damn it!

1610
01:02:02.762 --> 01:02:04.014
Yeah, nigga, fuck y'all,

1611
01:02:04.097 --> 01:02:05.497
Underdoggs, nigga,
what's happenin'?

1612
01:02:05.807 --> 01:02:07.350
It's a beautiful day
to see my brother,

1613
01:02:07.434 --> 01:02:09.060
Two-J's, drop his ego,

1614
01:02:09.144 --> 01:02:10.312
<i>and commit to coaching</i>

1615
01:02:10.896 --> 01:02:12.457
<i>these little brothers and

1616
01:02:12.481 --> 01:02:14.292
And today, we celebrate
with our favorite food!

1617
01:02:14.316 --> 01:02:15.358
What we eatin', y'all?

1618
01:02:15.442 --> 01:02:17.652
Raising Cane's!

1619
01:02:17.736 --> 01:02:19.279
So I wanna give
a double shoutout

1620
01:02:19.362 --> 01:02:21.257
to my main man, Todd Graves,
for makin' it happen.

1621
01:02:21.281 --> 01:02:23.408
The CEO, Todd, what's
happenin', baby?

1622
01:02:23.492 --> 01:02:24.993
- Yeah!

1623
01:02:25.744 --> 01:02:27.496
<i>The Underdoggs keep improving</i>

1624
01:02:27.579 --> 01:02:28.788
<i>and they keep on winning.</i>

1625
01:02:28.872 --> 01:02:29.998
Touchdown!

1626
01:02:30.081 --> 01:02:31.166
Celebrate, God damn it!

1627
01:02:31.249 --> 01:02:32.918
This is my titty!

1628
01:02:33.001 --> 01:02:35.378
<i>And Titties hasn't
dropped the ball once.</i>

1629
01:02:35.462 --> 01:02:36.546
<i>Dracarys!</i>

01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:37.756
<i>Check this out.</i>

1631
01:02:38.381 --> 01:02:40.318
<i>These little assholes have
a bigger fanbase than me.</i>

1632
01:02:40.342 --> 01:02:42.260
<i>Can you believe that?</i>

1633
01:02:42.344 --> 01:02:44.387
I mean, how desperate is
this man for attention?

1634
01:02:44.471 --> 01:02:45.631
Maybe it's too much cannabis.

1635
01:02:45.972 --> 01:02:47.265
<i>Clearly this is a PR stunt.</i>

1636
01:02:47.349 --> 01:02:48.850
- Pop, pop, pop.
<i>Even the Two-J's</i>

1637
01:02:48.934 --> 01:02:50.310
<i>made a comeback.</i>

1638
01:02:50.393 --> 01:02:51.853
<i>I'm really feelin'
the love, y'all.</i>

1639
01:02:51.937 --> 01:02:53.206
<i>We're here for the
love of the game,</i>

1640
01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:54.523
<i>not the love of ganja.</i>

1641
01:02:54.606 --> 01:02:55.649
Put it down.

1642
01:02:56.107 --> 01:02:57.943
<i>Well, almost everyone.</i>

1643
01:02:58.026 --> 01:03:00.737
<i>And our last win brings us
not only to the championship,</i>

1644
01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:02.656
<i>but ironically, face to face</i>

1645
01:03:02.739 --> 01:03:05.992
<i>with that bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitch, Chip Collins.</i>

1646
01:03:06.076 --> 01:03:10.372
Which brings me to my next
lesson for the kids, revenge.

1647
01:03:11.873 --> 01:03:13.291
Hashtag,

1648
01:03:13.375 --> 01:03:17.003
best mothafuckin'
role model ever.

1649
01:03:17.796 --> 01:03:19.005
Now, how about that?

1650
01:03:22.634 --> 01:03:23.927
Hey, man.

1651
01:03:24.928 --> 01:03:26.096
Here, I got you.

1652
01:03:26.805 --> 01:03:28.056
Hey, Tre, Tre. Pass it up.

1653
01:03:29.432 --> 01:03:30.632
Yo, Ghost.
- Ghost, right here,

1654
01:03:30.684 --> 01:03:31.768
- right here.
- Ball up!

1655
01:03:34.479 --> 01:03:36.648
Ooh!
- Damn!

1656
01:03:36.731 --> 01:03:39.025
God damn! Shit!

1657
01:03:39.442 --> 01:03:41.820
You just threw that thing
like 40 yards, easy?

1658
01:03:41.903 --> 01:03:43.280
And? All right, y'all.

1659
01:03:43.363 --> 01:03:45.365
Warm up. Last practice
before the championship.

1660
01:03:45.448 --> 01:03:47.617
- Let's get cracking!
- Round up, hurry up!

1661
01:03:47.701 --> 01:03:49.035
Team momma, what's happening?

1662
01:03:49.119 --> 01:03:50.537
What's up? Ahh!

1663
01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:52.789
So, apparently,

1664
01:03:52.872 --> 01:03:55.458
Chip Collins has been talking
a lot of shit about you

1665
01:03:55.542 --> 01:03:56.982
- on his show lately.
- Don't tell me

1666
01:03:57.043 --> 01:03:58.479
you've been listening to
that garbage, Cherise!

1667
01:03:58.503 --> 01:04:00.338
I mean, what choice do I have?

1668
01:04:00.422 --> 01:04:02.549
My favorite podcast
got soft on me.

1669
01:04:02.632 --> 01:04:04.426
- Talking about unity

1670
01:04:04.509 --> 01:04:06.511
and working together.

1671
01:04:06.595 --> 01:04:08.179
Where else am I
supposed to indulge

1672
01:04:08.263 --> 01:04:09.681
my guilty pleasure of listening

1673
01:04:09.764 --> 01:04:12.851
to some hot-shit asshole
blow smoke every day?

1674
01:04:13.602 --> 01:04:15.812
Did I hear you say
"favorite podcast"?

1675
01:04:18.189 --> 01:04:21.151
Yeah, hold on, let me take
this call, Rise, real quick.

1676
01:04:21.234 --> 01:04:23.653

01:04:36.791 --> 01:04:38.376
the woke one
though, don't worry.

1686
01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:41.796
He tells me that he
is a big fan of yours,

1687

<i>and he's been
following the thing</i>

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

<i>he's getting so misty-eyed</i>

1693

that he's telling
me that it makes him

1694
01:04:52.515 --> 01:04:54.267
want to be a better role model.

1695
01:04:54.351 --> 01:04:55.620

<i>- Hilarious. I know,</i>

1696

<i>he's so full of shit.</i>

1697
01:04:56.728 --> 01:04:57.979
The point is, he knows

1698
01:04:58.063 --> 01:04:59.856

gold right now.

1699
01:04:59.939 --> 01:05:03.693

01:05:52.367 --> 01:05:54.327
<i>- Hey, so congrats, man.</i>

1725
01:05:54.411 --> 01:05:56.097
<i>Listen, it's all gonna
move pretty fast, okay?</i>

1726
01:05:56.121 --> 01:05:57.831
<i>My assistant's
emailing you right now.</i>

1727
01:05:57.914 --> 01:06:00.083
<i>They want you on Fox
Sports this Sunday</i>

1728
01:06:00.166 --> 01:06:01.726
<i>to make the announcement
and guest host.</i>

1729
01:06:01.793 --> 01:06:03.336
- No, no, no...
Game's on Sunday.

1730
01:06:03.628 --> 01:06:05.147
That shit ain't gonna work.
Sunday not gonna work for me.

1731
01:06:05.171 --> 01:06:06.607
You gonna have to call
'em and reschedule that.

1732
01:06:06.631 --> 01:06:08.025
<i>Hey, no, no, no,
don't pull this, man.</i>

1733
01:06:08.049 --> 01:06:09.134
<i>You have any idea</i>

1734
01:06:09.467 --> 01:06:10.861
<i>how tough it was for
me to convince them,</i>

1735
01:06:10.885 --> 01:06:12.679
that you wouldn't
pull any diva shit?

1736
01:06:12.762 --> 01:06:13.888
Look, the Underdoggs got

1737
01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:15.700
a championship game
to win this Sunday.

1738
01:06:15.807 --> 01:06:17.535
No, I don't think you fuckin'
understand, I don't care

1739
01:06:17.559 --> 01:06:19.686
<i>if it's your mother's funeral.</i>

1740
01:06:19.769 --> 01:06:22.105
<i>Do you understand that? If
you don't show up to set,</i>

1741
01:06:22.188 --> 01:06:23.314
<i>this is all over.</i>

1742
01:06:23.398 --> 01:06:25.108
It's finished.
Your credibility,

1743
01:06:25.191 --> 01:06:26.526
the show, all of it.

1744
01:06:28.361 --> 01:06:29.988
<i>Do you get that?</i>

1745
01:06:30.071 --> 01:06:31.781
Oh, hell nah, hang
up or something.

1746
01:06:31.865 --> 01:06:33.324
Yo, cancel that.

1747
01:06:33.408 --> 01:06:35.528
- Let me call you back, Kauff.
<i>- Wait, wait, do not...</i>

1748
01:06:37.287 --> 01:06:38.747
That's our game, man.

1749
01:06:38.830 --> 01:06:39.956
We got a chance at the game.

1750
01:06:40.039 --> 01:06:41.124
Don't do this to us.

1751
01:06:41.207 --> 01:06:42.226
We got the
championship game, man.

1752
01:06:42.250 --> 01:06:43.585
- Jaycen?
- What?

1753
01:06:45.003 --> 01:06:47.046
You're gonna screw us over
like every other coach.

1754
01:06:47.130 --> 01:06:48.214
That's what.

1755
01:06:48.298 --> 01:06:49.799
Another one.

1756
01:06:49.883 --> 01:06:51.217
This is bullshit.

1757
01:06:51.301 --> 01:06:52.570
Come on, man, y'all gotta
just let me think, man.

1758
01:06:52.594 --> 01:06:54.220
About what? Leaving us?

1759
01:06:54.304 --> 01:06:55.680
About my life, dawg.

1760
01:06:56.222 --> 01:06:57.542
I've been out here
coaching y'all,

1761
01:06:57.891 --> 01:06:59.660
but this phone call I got is
what I've been waitin' on.

1762
01:06:59.684 --> 01:07:01.352
What you expect me to do?

1763
01:07:01.436 --> 01:07:04.230
I've been out here livin' this
basic-ass retirement life.

1764
01:07:04.314 --> 01:07:05.899
- I'm sick of that shit. Damn.

1765
01:07:05.982 --> 01:07:07.275
I'm sorry. I ain't realize

1766
01:07:07.358 --> 01:07:08.443
it was making you miserable

1767
01:07:08.526 --> 01:07:09.861
hanging around basic-ass people.

1768
01:07:09.944 --> 01:07:11.321
Man, that ain't what I said.

1769
01:07:11.404 --> 01:07:13.323
No, that's exactly
what you said.

1770
01:07:13.406 --> 01:07:15.492
What, y'all bein' real
fucking selfish right now.

1771
01:07:15.575 --> 01:07:16.618
Yeah.

1772
01:07:18.036 --> 01:07:19.788
This is my dream
come true right here.

1773
01:07:22.248 --> 01:07:23.249
Damn.

1774
01:07:25.210 --> 01:07:26.461
Man, forget this.

1775
01:07:26.544 --> 01:07:27.670
Like that? For real?

1776
01:07:28.296 --> 01:07:29.798
After all I did for these kids,

1777
01:07:29.881 --> 01:07:31.174
that's how y'all gonna do me?

1778
01:07:31.257 --> 01:07:32.693
Y'all gonna let
these ungrateful kids

1779
01:07:32.717 --> 01:07:34.052
do me like this?

1780
01:07:34.135 --> 01:07:35.720
How you gonna do us like that?

1781
01:07:36.304 --> 01:07:37.388
There you go.

1782
01:07:37.889 --> 01:07:39.307
That's the JJ I know.

1783
01:07:39.974 --> 01:07:41.726
You know, for a second...

1784
01:07:43.728 --> 01:07:45.772
I actually thought you
wanted to help them.

1785
01:07:46.773 --> 01:07:48.024
Just for a second.

1786
01:07:49.025 --> 01:07:50.527
I feel stupid.

1787
01:07:52.779 --> 01:07:54.239
Damn, cuz.

1788
01:07:54.322 --> 01:07:57.575
Emilio Estevez gonna
be real disappointed.

1789
01:08:12.465 --> 01:08:13.466
Fuck.

1790
01:08:26.938 --> 01:08:28.314
Tre! Tre!

1791
01:08:28.398 --> 01:08:30.483
Hey, Tre! Hey!

1792
01:08:30.567 --> 01:08:31.734
It's okay.

1793
01:08:36.698 --> 01:08:39.450
Yo, Coach! I'm not
crazy. Right? Right?

1794
01:08:39.534 --> 01:08:41.578
I mean, ever since you
Jedi mind-tricked me

1795
01:08:41.661 --> 01:08:43.788
with all that poor-ass
couch and kid talk,

1796
01:08:43.872 --> 01:08:46.124
I've been nothing but
a positive role model

1797
01:08:46.207 --> 01:08:47.458
to them kids, man.

1798
01:08:47.542 --> 01:08:48.877
And now my shit blowin' up,

1799
01:08:49.544 --> 01:08:51.129
they want me to
stop what I'm doin',

1800
01:08:51.212 --> 01:08:53.131
continue doin' what
I'm doin' with them

1801
01:08:53.214 --> 01:08:54.424
and put my shit on pause.

1802
01:08:54.507 --> 01:08:56.009
What the fuck
kinda shit is that?

1803
01:08:56.718 --> 01:08:59.178
Listen, man, I'm sorry, Jaycen.

1804
01:08:59.262 --> 01:09:00.972
I mean, it's been
a long day for me.

1805
01:09:01.055 --> 01:09:03.391
But I gotta get
home to my family.

1806
01:09:04.183 --> 01:09:05.894
- You'll figure it out.
- Come on.

1807
01:09:05.977 --> 01:09:07.145
Family, Coach?

1808
01:09:07.228 --> 01:09:08.563
Hey, feel free to
use that couch.

1809
01:09:08.646 --> 01:09:09.689
Fuck that couch!

1810
01:09:12.817 --> 01:09:14.360
Damn, Jaycen.

1811
01:09:25.204 --> 01:09:26.915
<i>Everybody, welcome to</i>

1812
01:09:26.998 --> 01:09:29.208
<i>the Long Beach Youth
Football League Championship.</i>

1813
01:09:29.626 --> 01:09:31.002
<i>Once again, we have</i>

1814
01:09:31.085 --> 01:09:32.396
<i>the undefeated
Colonels looking to...</i>

1815
01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:35.173
Punish them for their sins.

1816
01:09:35.256 --> 01:09:36.591
Sinners!

1817
01:09:36.674 --> 01:09:38.259
- Slit their throats. Throats!

1818
01:09:38.676 --> 01:09:41.137
And what do men do? Dominate!

1819
01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:42.764
- And what do men do?
- Dominate!

1820
01:09:42.847 --> 01:09:43.973
Heads on spikes!

1821
01:09:44.557 --> 01:09:46.452
Yo, is it just me or do they
look like they got bigger?

1822
01:09:46.476 --> 01:09:48.186
- Heads on spikes!
- Heads on spikes!

1823
01:09:48.269 --> 01:09:49.562
Heads on spikes!

1824
01:09:49.896 --> 01:09:51.582
Okay, bring it in for a
prayer, guys. Come on in.

1825
01:09:51.606 --> 01:09:53.942
All right, all right, y'all,
hey, y'all, gather around.

1826
01:09:54.025 --> 01:09:56.110
Let's gather around.
Let's get it together.

1827
01:09:56.194 --> 01:09:57.737
Okay, now kids.

1828
01:09:57.820 --> 01:09:59.489
I know y'all haven't had

1829
01:09:59.989 --> 01:10:02.283
the best choices of
coaches at this point.

1830
01:10:02.742 --> 01:10:04.953
But I just wanna thank
you little mothafuckers

1831
01:10:05.036 --> 01:10:06.496
from the bottom of my heart

1832
01:10:07.038 --> 01:10:08.623
for accepting me

1833
01:10:08.706 --> 01:10:11.584
and lettin' me be
y'all coach at this...

1834
01:10:12.877 --> 01:10:14.295
I'm gettin' emotional.

1835
01:10:14.379 --> 01:10:15.672
Kareem, don't do it.

1836
01:10:15.755 --> 01:10:18.049
Kareem, get yourself
together. Kareem.

1837
01:10:18.132 --> 01:10:19.592
- Breathe. It's okay, Kareem.

1838
01:10:22.553 --> 01:10:23.930
Welcome to Fox Football Sunday.

1839
01:10:24.013 --> 01:10:26.015
I'm Curt Menefee,
alongside Terry Bradshaw,

1840
01:10:26.099 --> 01:10:28.142
Michael Strahan, Howie Long,

1841
01:10:28.226 --> 01:10:30.436
and joining us as a
guest host for the week

1842
01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:32.230
is a man who really
needs no introduction.

1843
01:10:32.313 --> 01:10:34.065
Always going above and beyond

1844
01:10:34.148 --> 01:10:35.900
the call of community service,

1845
01:10:35.984 --> 01:10:37.944
he's captured the
hearts and the minds

1846
01:10:38.027 --> 01:10:39.862
of the entire sports world,

1847
01:10:39.946 --> 01:10:41.489
inspiring us all,

1848
01:10:41.572 --> 01:10:44.117
forming a bond with
these incredible kids

1849
01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:45.576
that can never be broken.

1850
01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:47.328
Here at Fox Sports,

1851
01:10:47.412 --> 01:10:50.081
we consider ourselves a family,

1852
01:10:50.164 --> 01:10:51.833
and we couldn't be more excited

1853
01:10:51.916 --> 01:10:54.210
to welcome into our Fox family,

1854
01:10:54.293 --> 01:10:56.963
not just one of the greatest
players of all time,

1855
01:10:57.046 --> 01:10:58.631
but one of the best people.

1856
01:10:58.715 --> 01:11:01.551
Ladies and Gentlemen,
the new host of FS1's

1857
01:11:01.634 --> 01:11:03.845
<i>You Don't Want That Smoke
with Jaycen Jennings,</i>

1858
01:11:03.928 --> 01:11:06.889
the one and only Jaycen
Jennings. Welcome, JJ.

1859
01:11:06.973 --> 01:11:08.224
- Yeah.
- Welcome.

1860
01:11:08.307 --> 01:11:10.101
Two-J's! Welcome to
the Fox Family, man.

1861
01:11:22.363 --> 01:11:23.740
I gotta get home to my family.

1862
01:11:24.282 --> 01:11:25.283
Family.

1863
01:11:25.950 --> 01:11:27.410
Family.

1864
01:11:32.248 --> 01:11:33.916
I gotta piss. I'll
be right back.

1865
01:11:38.463 --> 01:11:40.131
Hey, I told you we
shouldn't hire him.

1866
01:11:40.214 --> 01:11:41.358
- I never liked his ass...
- I told you.

1867
01:11:41.382 --> 01:11:42.383
When he played.

1868
01:11:42.467 --> 01:11:43.551
And I sure as hell

1869
01:11:43.634 --> 01:11:44.794
- don't like him now.
- Right.

1870
01:11:45.136 --> 01:11:47.016
Why don't we take a quick,
uh, commercial break?

1871
01:11:47.305 --> 01:11:48.473
Oh, that was all on camera

1872
01:11:48.556 --> 01:11:50.683
while we just said all that?

1873
01:11:52.185 --> 01:11:53.311
Thank you, Father, so much

1874
01:11:53.394 --> 01:11:54.812
for inventing a hard plastic

1875
01:11:54.896 --> 01:11:57.065
that we can slam into
our opponents' faces,

1876
01:11:57.148 --> 01:11:59.358
causing irreparable
damage to their brains.

1877
01:11:59.442 --> 01:12:01.235
Now, I got a gang

1878
01:12:01.319 --> 01:12:03.738
of inspirational
speeches for y'all,

1879
01:12:04.197 --> 01:12:05.907
to bring y'all together.

1880
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:08.785
If I can find the mothafucker,
they in my pocket somewhere.

1881
01:12:09.786 --> 01:12:12.872
Oh, shit. Oh, you
don't need to see that.

1882
01:12:12.955 --> 01:12:14.290
There you are.

1883
01:12:14.957 --> 01:12:17.210
Vince Lombardi once said,

1884
01:12:17.710 --> 01:12:20.880
"The blood of a covenant
is thicker than a bitch."

1885
01:12:20.963 --> 01:12:22.507
- Oh, oh, oh.

1886
01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:24.008
Sorry, Cherise.

1887
01:12:24.092 --> 01:12:26.594
No, Vince Lombardi once said,

1888
01:12:26.677 --> 01:12:28.596
-"The blood of a covenant..."
"Of a covenant...

1889
01:12:30.932 --> 01:12:32.809
"is thicker than the
water of the womb."

1890
01:12:32.892 --> 01:12:34.185
Damn, bro.

1891
01:12:34.727 --> 01:12:36.145
Actually, that wasn't Lombardi.

1892
01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:38.106
That was God. In the Bible.

1893
01:12:38.648 --> 01:12:40.149
He looks like a
Black Princess Leia.

1894
01:12:40.566 --> 01:12:42.110
Gotta be hot in
that fuckin' jacket.

1895
01:12:42.610 --> 01:12:43.653
Why are you even here?

1896
01:12:44.112 --> 01:12:45.947
Good question, Superstar.

1897
01:12:46.030 --> 01:12:48.533
I was in the midst of my
triumphant television debut,

1898
01:12:48.616 --> 01:12:51.494
when all of a sudden I told
America I had to take a piss.

1899
01:12:51.577 --> 01:12:52.721
But really, it
was just an excuse

1900
01:12:52.745 --> 01:12:53.825
so I can get up outta there

1901
01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:55.432
and get down here
and talk to you kids.

1902
01:12:55.456 --> 01:12:56.916
And why the hell
would you do that?

1903
01:12:56.999 --> 01:12:59.127
Another excellent
question, Titties.

1904
01:12:59.210 --> 01:13:00.336
Let me tell you why.

1905
01:13:01.129 --> 01:13:02.130
Family.

1906
01:13:03.172 --> 01:13:04.932
A word that a lot of
people take for granted.

1907
01:13:05.925 --> 01:13:07.605
You know, some would
say, "Who needs family

1908
01:13:07.635 --> 01:13:11.013
"when you got money, fame,
and your own TV talk show?"

1909
01:13:11.556 --> 01:13:13.356
You know, I was at the
pinnacle of my comeback

1910
01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:16.978
when gap-tooth wearin' ass
Michael Strahan told me

1911
01:13:17.061 --> 01:13:19.230
I was about to become
a part of his family.

1912
01:13:20.064 --> 01:13:21.399
But you see,

1913
01:13:21.482 --> 01:13:23.109
he ain't a part of my family.

1914
01:13:23.693 --> 01:13:24.735
Y'all are.

1915
01:13:25.570 --> 01:13:27.155
That's what Coach
Feis was tryna tell me

1916
01:13:27.238 --> 01:13:28.739
this whole damn time.

1917
01:13:28.823 --> 01:13:30.950
Was I needed to find
my way back home

1918
01:13:31.492 --> 01:13:34.245
and get to my family.

1919
01:13:35.454 --> 01:13:36.956
Sorry I messed up.

1920
01:13:37.039 --> 01:13:38.332
Won't happen again.

1921
01:13:40.042 --> 01:13:41.169
So, what's up, family?

1922
01:13:41.252 --> 01:13:42.378
Anybody down to go whoop

1923
01:13:42.461 --> 01:13:44.005
on some bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitches

1924
01:13:44.088 --> 01:13:45.840
and win a championship or what?

1925
01:13:54.557 --> 01:13:56.184
Fuck, let's get it!

1926
01:13:57.685 --> 01:13:59.145
Underdoggs, on me.

1927
01:13:59.228 --> 01:14:00.479
"Underdoggs" on three.

1928
01:14:00.563 --> 01:14:03.774
One, two, three, Underdoggs!

1929
01:14:04.942 --> 01:14:07.153
I could've never said
a speech like that, J.

1930
01:14:07.236 --> 01:14:08.613
Where you going, cuz?

1931
01:14:09.405 --> 01:14:11.908
I need you on the sideline
for this one, Coach.

1932
01:14:12.909 --> 01:14:16.329
Oh! "Assistant Coach Kareem"!

1933
01:14:16.412 --> 01:14:18.289
In Old English letters,
just like you like it.

1934
01:14:18.372 --> 01:14:20.416
Momma! We made it!

1935
01:14:22.376 --> 01:14:23.628
Let's go!

1936
01:14:23.711 --> 01:14:24.921
Ready?

1937
01:14:25.004 --> 01:14:27.089
God bless America.

1938
01:14:27.173 --> 01:14:28.466
God bless the Colonels.

1939
01:14:28.549 --> 01:14:31.427
God bless Long Beach,
the nicer parts.

1940
01:14:31.886 --> 01:14:33.679
Bitch-ass, punk-ass bitch!

1941
01:14:33.763 --> 01:14:34.847
- Let's go!

1942
01:14:35.681 --> 01:14:37.308
Let's go, Underdoggs!

1943
01:14:38.392 --> 01:14:39.477
Run that offense, Tre.

1944
01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:41.479
Down! Set!

1945
01:14:43.606 --> 01:14:44.607
Hut!

1946
01:14:47.777 --> 01:14:50.112
Come on, Gary! Get it!

1947
01:14:51.155 --> 01:14:52.698
Good block! Good
fuckin' block!

1948
01:14:52.782 --> 01:14:54.009
Yeah! Go, go, go!
Hit that shit, Tony!

1949
01:14:54.033 --> 01:14:55.117
- Go! Go!
- Ooh, ooh!

1950
01:14:56.369 --> 01:14:58.454
- Yeah! Yes!

1951
01:14:58.537 --> 01:14:59.872
- Way to go! Hell yeah!
- Yeah!

1952
01:14:59.956 --> 01:15:01.058
That's what I'm talking about!

1953
01:15:01.082 --> 01:15:02.833
Yes!
- Ref! Carl!

1954
01:15:03.376 --> 01:15:05.419
No touchdown.
- What the fuck?

1955
01:15:06.462 --> 01:15:09.006
I got a holding on the offense.

1956
01:15:09.090 --> 01:15:10.633
That's a 10-yard penalty.

1957
01:15:12.343 --> 01:15:14.136
Replay, second down.

1958
01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:15.930
Ain't that the same
mothafuckin' ref

1959
01:15:16.013 --> 01:15:18.015
that got knocked out the
last time we played him?

1960
01:15:19.558 --> 01:15:20.601
Hell yeah.

1961
01:15:22.561 --> 01:15:23.771
Aye, ref.

1962
01:15:24.146 --> 01:15:26.065
If you take that Slick
Rick patch off your eye,

1963
01:15:26.148 --> 01:15:28.025
you'll see you made
the wrong call.

1964
01:15:28.109 --> 01:15:29.527
Okay, that's what
we like to see.

1965
01:15:29.610 --> 01:15:31.487
You lose an eye, the
other one gets stronger.

1966
01:15:31.570 --> 01:15:33.447
Go! Lock up, lock up.

1967
01:15:33.531 --> 01:15:34.532
Defense!

1968
01:15:35.324 --> 01:15:36.492
Oh, hey.

1969
01:15:36.575 --> 01:15:37.952
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1970
01:15:38.035 --> 01:15:39.954
Touchdown!

1971
01:15:40.037 --> 01:15:41.163
Touchdown!

1972
01:15:41.247 --> 01:15:42.790
Justice is served.

1973
01:15:42.873 --> 01:15:44.292
Let's go, let's go, Underdoggs.

1974
01:15:44.375 --> 01:15:45.894
- Let's go. Let's go.
You're still in it.

1975
01:15:45.918 --> 01:15:46.919
Set...

1976
01:15:47.003 --> 01:15:48.045
Let's go, D.

1977
01:15:48.129 --> 01:15:49.213
Go!

1978
01:15:51.716 --> 01:15:53.718
Let's go, let's go,
defense, lock up, lock up!

1979
01:15:55.261 --> 01:15:56.304
Yeah! Yes!

1980
01:15:56.387 --> 01:15:58.306
- Boom!
- Yeah. Dick in the dirt!

1981
01:15:58.389 --> 01:16:00.182
It's a lady, Timmy!

1982
01:16:00.266 --> 01:16:01.910
You want a lady to lay you
on your back like that,

1983
01:16:01.934 --> 01:16:02.977
I'll take you to Vegas.

1984
01:16:03.436 --> 01:16:04.895
I got a personal foul.

1985
01:16:04.979 --> 01:16:06.290
- Unnecessary
roughness. It's a foul.

1986
01:16:06.314 --> 01:16:07.523
On the defense.
- Oh, come on.

1987
01:16:07.606 --> 01:16:08.858
Come on, man. Number 42.

1988
01:16:08.941 --> 01:16:10.401
That's some solid
officiating, Carl.

1989
01:16:10.484 --> 01:16:12.111
These animals have
been getting away

1990
01:16:12.194 --> 01:16:13.362
with murder all season.

1991
01:16:13.446 --> 01:16:14.613
Shake it off, guys!

1992
01:16:17.658 --> 01:16:19.702
- Hut!

1993
01:16:19.785 --> 01:16:21.495
Let's go, Tre. Pass, pass!

1994
01:16:22.997 --> 01:16:24.749
That's holding on the offense.

1995
01:16:24.832 --> 01:16:26.083
No touchdown.

1996
01:16:26.167 --> 01:16:27.436
Get your ass back
to the Footlocker.

1997
01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:28.627
Go!

1998
01:16:29.045 --> 01:16:30.671
Let's go, defense!
Catch him, catch him!

1999
01:16:30.755 --> 01:16:31.756
Get the fuckin' ball!

2000
01:16:33.049 --> 01:16:35.092
Booyah!

2001
01:16:35.176 --> 01:16:37.345
Touchdown! Touchdown!

2002
01:16:40.639 --> 01:16:43.184
When God is on your
side, you cannot fail.

2003
01:16:43.809 --> 01:16:45.102
Hut!

2004
01:16:46.270 --> 01:16:47.521
Offsides.
- Really?

2005
01:16:47.605 --> 01:16:48.814
Oh, it's a pass, pass, pass.

2006
01:16:48.898 --> 01:16:50.107
What's going on over here?

2007
01:16:50.191 --> 01:16:51.400
- Personal foul... Come on!

2008
01:16:51.484 --> 01:16:53.204
- Roughing the passer.
- Great call, ref.

2009
01:16:53.944 --> 01:16:55.571
Red's on D, red's on D.

2010
01:16:55.654 --> 01:16:57.239
Lock up, lock up!

2011
01:16:57.323 --> 01:16:59.116
Oh, it's a pass, pass, pass!

2012
01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:00.785
- Pick that shit
up! Go, go, go!

2013
01:17:00.868 --> 01:17:02.453
- Yeah!
- Good defense, Dwayne.

2014
01:17:02.536 --> 01:17:04.246
- Good, D.
- Pass interference.

2015
01:17:04.330 --> 01:17:05.331
- Foul.
- Oh, come on,

2016
01:17:05.414 --> 01:17:06.791
with the late-flag shit, ref.

2017
01:17:06.874 --> 01:17:07.875
I ain't even touch him.

2018
01:17:07.958 --> 01:17:09.210
Go, go, get that shit.

2019
01:17:09.293 --> 01:17:10.419
I got a false start.

2020
01:17:10.503 --> 01:17:11.754
- Come on. Clipping.

2021
01:17:12.129 --> 01:17:13.398
- You're a ref for both
sides! Roughin' the passer.

2022
01:17:13.422 --> 01:17:14.507
Come on!

2023
01:17:14.590 --> 01:17:16.050
That one eye's working overtime.

2024
01:17:16.133 --> 01:17:17.468
No touchdown.

2025
01:17:17.551 --> 01:17:19.428
Automatic first down.

2026
01:17:19.512 --> 01:17:22.390
That's the type of officiating
we like. Keep it up.

2027
01:17:22.473 --> 01:17:24.058
How much you pay the ref, Chip?

2028
01:17:31.982 --> 01:17:32.983
Listen up.

2029
01:17:33.776 --> 01:17:34.902
I ain't gonna hold you.

2030
01:17:37.113 --> 01:17:38.280
We in a tough spot.

2031
01:17:38.781 --> 01:17:40.592
How we gonna win if they keep
calling stuff against us?

2032
01:17:40.616 --> 01:17:42.910
It's like the Battle of
the Bastards out there.

2033
01:17:42.993 --> 01:17:44.495
They're hate-fucking us, bro.

2034
01:17:44.578 --> 01:17:46.080
All up and down the field.

2035
01:17:46.163 --> 01:17:47.665
Hard. Right up the ass.

2036
01:17:55.714 --> 01:17:57.341
What are y'all bitchin' about?

2037
01:17:59.593 --> 01:18:02.221
Is this the first time we
had shit workin' against us?

2038
01:18:03.097 --> 01:18:04.390
Shit out of our control?

2039
01:18:06.142 --> 01:18:07.852
Man, we face that every day,

2040
01:18:07.935 --> 01:18:09.603
that's why we
Underdoggs, ain't it?

2041
01:18:11.272 --> 01:18:13.649
We always playin' from behind.

2042
01:18:13.732 --> 01:18:16.193
We gotta work twice as
hard to get half as far.

2043
01:18:17.445 --> 01:18:19.447
But the thing about
the Underdoggs is,

2044
01:18:19.530 --> 01:18:21.490
we never fold, we
never surrender.

2045
01:18:21.574 --> 01:18:22.908
When everybody count us out,

2046
01:18:22.992 --> 01:18:24.118
we believe in ourselves.

2047
01:18:26.579 --> 01:18:28.330
So, let's embrace that shit.

2048
01:18:28.414 --> 01:18:29.623
Let's embrace who we are.

2049
01:18:31.041 --> 01:18:32.835
Let's go out there
and shock the world.

2050
01:18:32.918 --> 01:18:34.170
Let's show everybody

2051
01:18:34.462 --> 01:18:35.647
what the mothafuckin'
Underdoggs are made of.

2052
01:18:35.671 --> 01:18:36.881
Hell yeah!

2053
01:18:36.964 --> 01:18:38.966
Yeah!

2054
01:18:40.468 --> 01:18:41.844
Yeah, we got this, dawg.

2055
01:18:43.304 --> 01:18:44.322
That's what I'm talkin' about.

2056
01:18:44.346 --> 01:18:45.764
Yo, Tre. Tre.

2057
01:18:49.101 --> 01:18:50.644
That's what's up, man.

2058
01:18:50.728 --> 01:18:52.897
Let's get dirty. Yeah!

2059
01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:54.064
Yeah!

2060
01:18:57.485 --> 01:18:59.695
Yeah, let's come out like
I wanted to come out.

2061
01:18:59.778 --> 01:19:01.780
- Let's go! Let's go!

2062
01:19:02.823 --> 01:19:05.242
Colonels, we're gonna keep on
followin' our destiny. Okay?

2063
01:19:05.326 --> 01:19:06.636
We had some rough
couple of moments.

2064
01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:08.096
- Right.
- Matter of fact, you played

2065
01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:09.760
absolutely pathetically
at certain points.

2066
01:19:09.955 --> 01:19:12.208
It's a miracle
we're up 24-nothing.

2067
01:19:12.291 --> 01:19:13.459
I had a lot to do with that.

2068
01:19:13.542 --> 01:19:14.686
Sometimes I can make miracle...

2069
01:19:14.710 --> 01:19:16.003
Yeah, let's fuckin' go!

2070
01:19:16.086 --> 01:19:17.086
Yes, come on! Man up!

2071
01:19:17.129 --> 01:19:19.608
It's time for that theme song.
New hair. New look. Let's get it!

2072
01:19:19.632 --> 01:19:20.758
Oh, shit. What's this?

2073
01:19:20.841 --> 01:19:22.051
There's some new ass to kick!

2074
01:19:22.134 --> 01:19:23.177
Doggs, go! Let's go!

2075
01:19:24.970 --> 01:19:26.290
<i>Little bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitches</i>

2076
01:19:26.430 --> 01:19:28.307
<i>You little bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitches</i>

2077
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:30.809
<i>You little bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitches</i>

2078
01:19:30.893 --> 01:19:33.145
<i>Little bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitches</i>

2079
01:19:33.646 --> 01:19:35.648
<i>Little bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitches</i>

2080
01:19:35.731 --> 01:19:38.484
<i>You little bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitches</i>

2081
01:19:38.567 --> 01:19:41.237
<i>You little bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitches</i>

2082
01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:43.531
<i>You little bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitches</i>

2083
01:19:43.614 --> 01:19:45.241
Oh, very nice, Two-J's.

2084
01:19:45.324 --> 01:19:46.784
Love the language.

2085
01:19:50.204 --> 01:19:51.372
Great jerseys, by the way.

2086
01:19:51.455 --> 01:19:53.815
What happened to the other ones?
They get repo'd at halftime?

2087
01:19:53.916 --> 01:19:56.001
<i>You little bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitches</i>

2088
01:19:56.085 --> 01:19:58.796
<i>Little bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitches</i>

2089
01:19:58.879 --> 01:20:00.756
<i>Little bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitches</i>

2090
01:20:01.423 --> 01:20:03.676
<i>Little bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitches</i>

2091
01:20:03.759 --> 01:20:05.010
- <i>Little bitch-ass</i>
- Seem, uh...

2092
01:20:05.094 --> 01:20:06.387
<i>- Punk-ass bitches</i> - angry.

2093
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:07.846
<i>Little bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitches</i>

2094
01:20:07.930 --> 01:20:09.223
Bitches!

2095
01:20:09.306 --> 01:20:10.325
<i>Little bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitches</i>

2096
01:20:10.349 --> 01:20:11.642
Why do they all seem so angry?

2097
01:20:11.725 --> 01:20:13.978
<i>Little bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitches</i>

2098
01:20:14.061 --> 01:20:15.247
<i>- Little bitch-ass</i> -
What's up with that?

2099
01:20:15.271 --> 01:20:16.730
<i>- Punk-ass bitches</i> - Whoo!

2100
01:20:16.814 --> 01:20:18.482
- Someone get me a
40! Go! Let's go!

2101
01:20:23.028 --> 01:20:24.113
Continue dominance, men.

2102
01:20:24.196 --> 01:20:25.364
Let's go!

2103
01:20:25.447 --> 01:20:26.824
Squash 'em.

2104
01:20:33.831 --> 01:20:35.082
Let's go!

2105
01:20:35.165 --> 01:20:36.417
Go! Go! Let's go!

2106
01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:37.585
Whoo!

2107
01:20:37.668 --> 01:20:40.421
Oh, shit! Go, go,
get that shit!

2108
01:20:40.504 --> 01:20:42.214
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
What's going on?

2109
01:20:42.298 --> 01:20:44.258
Put some hands on him.
What's going on here?

2110
01:20:44.341 --> 01:20:45.759
Yeah! Oh, good block!

2111
01:20:45.843 --> 01:20:47.094
Watch it! Red comin' in hot!

2112
01:20:47.177 --> 01:20:48.387
Spin on his ass, Tre.

2113
01:20:49.513 --> 01:20:50.598
Oh!

2114
01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:53.017
Yeah!

2115
01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:54.351
All day, all the way, Tre!

2116
01:20:54.435 --> 01:20:56.812
- Go, go, go, go! Yes!

2117
01:20:57.438 --> 01:20:58.939
Wassup!
- Yeah!

2118
01:20:59.023 --> 01:21:00.065
Touchdown.

2119
01:21:01.025 --> 01:21:02.735
Hey, ref, where's the call?

2120
01:21:02.818 --> 01:21:03.978
You took care of the referee?

2121
01:21:04.445 --> 01:21:05.613
No, Killa and Skrilla did.

2122
01:21:11.118 --> 01:21:13.120
No holding? Illegal formation?

2123
01:21:13.203 --> 01:21:14.455
Wassup now, Chip?

2124
01:21:14.538 --> 01:21:16.582
- Come on, Carl!

2125
01:21:16.665 --> 01:21:18.167
Let's go, D, lock up, let's go!

2126
01:21:18.250 --> 01:21:19.501
Pass, pass, pass.

2127
01:21:19.585 --> 01:21:20.878
- Yeah!

2128
01:21:20.961 --> 01:21:22.463
Good defense, Dwayne. Good, D.

2129
01:21:22.546 --> 01:21:23.964
Where's the call, huh?

2130
01:21:24.423 --> 01:21:25.424
Hut!

2131
01:21:26.925 --> 01:21:28.177
- First down.

2132
01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:29.261
Hell yeah!

2133
01:21:29.678 --> 01:21:31.013
<i>We got a chance, I can feel it.</i>

2134
01:21:31.096 --> 01:21:32.514
Go! Red's on D!

2135
01:21:32.598 --> 01:21:33.891
Red's on D!

2136
01:21:33.974 --> 01:21:35.559
Oh, it's a pass, pass, pass!

2137
01:21:35.643 --> 01:21:37.478
Bingo!
- Oh, shit! Good pick, Dwayne.

2138
01:21:38.062 --> 01:21:39.772
What the hell is going on here?

2139
01:21:39.855 --> 01:21:41.774
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

2140
01:21:41.857 --> 01:21:43.025
Stop him!
- Yeah!

2141
01:21:43.108 --> 01:21:44.109
Stop him!

2142
01:21:44.193 --> 01:21:46.111
Oh, Prime Time, Deion Sanders!

2143
01:21:46.487 --> 01:21:47.821
Touchdown!

2144
01:21:47.905 --> 01:21:49.782
Turn the fucking ball
over and embarrass me,

2145
01:21:49.865 --> 01:21:51.283
you useless piece of shit.

2146
01:21:51.367 --> 01:21:53.118
Get your asses back
to the sidelines.

2147
01:21:53.202 --> 01:21:54.787
Come on, y'all, we
runnin' outta time!

2148
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:56.955
Go, go, go, get that shit!

2149
01:21:57.039 --> 01:21:58.332
Clipping.

2150
01:21:58.415 --> 01:21:59.416
On the defense.

2151
01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:01.251
What is happening right now?

2152
01:22:03.045 --> 01:22:04.046
Down!

2153
01:22:05.214 --> 01:22:06.316
- Go, let's go!
- Come on, Gary!

2154
01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:07.925
- Hut!

2155
01:22:08.008 --> 01:22:09.718
Tony, hit that shit! Go!

2156
01:22:12.554 --> 01:22:15.182
- Touchdown.
- Air Tony like a mothafucker!

2157
01:22:15.265 --> 01:22:16.600
This isn't cheerleading.

2158
01:22:16.684 --> 01:22:18.227
What is this, Cirque du Soleil?

2159
01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:19.430
Touchdown.
- That's our Tony!

2160
01:22:19.478 --> 01:22:20.979
- That's my son!

2161
01:22:21.063 --> 01:22:22.874
You can't be jumping on top
of each other like that.

2162
01:22:22.898 --> 01:22:24.066
What the hell?

2163
01:22:24.149 --> 01:22:25.442
We on your mothafuckin' ass now.

2164
01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:29.071
I need one yard, first down,

2165
01:22:29.154 --> 01:22:30.948
and then you run out
that goddamn clock.

2166
01:22:31.031 --> 01:22:32.157
Get that goddamn ball back!

2167
01:22:32.241 --> 01:22:33.450
- Defense!
- Come on!

2168
01:22:33.534 --> 01:22:34.910
- Defense! Set! Hut!

2169
01:22:36.203 --> 01:22:37.246
Let's go!

2170
01:22:37.329 --> 01:22:40.016
Come on, come on, come on, make the
play, make the play, make the play!

2171
01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:40.916
Come on, come on, come on.

2172
01:22:40.999 --> 01:22:42.042
Make the hit!

2173
01:22:43.127 --> 01:22:44.878
- Yeah!
- You better, Ghost!

2174
01:22:45.421 --> 01:22:47.131
Oh, God damn it!

2175
01:22:47.923 --> 01:22:49.133
What is wrong with you?

2176
01:22:49.216 --> 01:22:50.968
I said do not fuck
this up for me!

2177
01:22:51.051 --> 01:22:52.678
You just got dominated, bitch!

2178
01:22:54.596 --> 01:22:56.348
First down, Green Team.

2179
01:22:57.182 --> 01:22:59.560
Come on, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

2180
01:22:59.643 --> 01:23:01.270
Good shit! Way to go!

2181
01:23:01.353 --> 01:23:02.730
Come on, y'all, gather around.

2182
01:23:09.820 --> 01:23:10.821
Man.

2183
01:23:11.822 --> 01:23:14.241
Twenty-five years ago, I
was in this same situation.

2184
01:23:14.324 --> 01:23:15.367
Right.

2185
01:23:15.659 --> 01:23:18.162
Down by three,
championship on the line,

2186
01:23:18.245 --> 01:23:19.872
and then bam!

2187
01:23:19.955 --> 01:23:21.248
Mothafuckin' miracle happen.

2188
01:23:21.707 --> 01:23:23.685
Talkin' about when you caught
the Hail Mary in end zone?

2189
01:23:23.709 --> 01:23:25.228
Hell yeah, how you
know about that play?

2190
01:23:25.252 --> 01:23:26.412
That shit way older than you.

2191
01:23:26.879 --> 01:23:28.338
Been watching me
on YouTube, huh?

2192
01:23:28.922 --> 01:23:30.132
Guess I am your role model.

2193
01:23:30.215 --> 01:23:31.508
Bruh...

2194
01:23:31.592 --> 01:23:33.192
What y'all say, let's
run that shit back?

2195
01:23:34.011 --> 01:23:35.888
- Yo, what about a
trick play? Yeah.

2196
01:23:35.971 --> 01:23:37.347
I love a trick play.

2197
01:23:37.431 --> 01:23:39.099
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

2198
01:23:39.183 --> 01:23:41.727
Yeah, I think it's time we
pull out our secret weapon.

2199
01:23:41.810 --> 01:23:43.854
Great idea, Tony.
Trick or treat, y'all.

2200
01:23:43.937 --> 01:23:45.537
"Underdoggs" on three.
Underdoggs, on me.

2201
01:23:45.606 --> 01:23:47.399
- One, two, three,
Underdoggs! Underdoggs!

2202
01:23:47.483 --> 01:23:50.527
Let's go. Let's go!
Run that shit, Tre!

2203
01:23:50.611 --> 01:23:52.654
What are you waiting for?
Get the hell out there!

2204
01:23:53.238 --> 01:23:54.531
Let's go! Go!

2205
01:23:57.409 --> 01:23:59.137
Men, I need a stop here,
and your life depends on it.

2206
01:23:59.161 --> 01:24:00.601
Come on, come on,
pull this shit off.

2207
01:24:00.662 --> 01:24:02.372
- Come on! Whoo!

2208
01:24:02.456 --> 01:24:04.208
- Let's go! Down!

2209
01:24:04.291 --> 01:24:06.126
- Go Underdoggs!
- Come on!

2210
01:24:06.210 --> 01:24:08.128
Set!
- Let's go, homie, let's go!

2211
01:24:08.879 --> 01:24:10.380
Ghost!

2212
01:24:12.382 --> 01:24:13.884
Wait, wait. What's
goin' on over here?

2213
01:24:13.967 --> 01:24:15.403
Come on, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

2214
01:24:15.427 --> 01:24:16.470
What's she doin' here?

2215
01:24:16.553 --> 01:24:17.873
Hold on, she doesn't
play offense.

2216
01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:19.056
I don't trust her.

2217
01:24:19.348 --> 01:24:21.642
Eyes on her! That
little girl's a psycho!

2218
01:24:28.190 --> 01:24:29.775
Winter is coming!

2219
01:24:29.858 --> 01:24:31.693
- Hut! <i>Dracarys!</i> Hut!

2220
01:24:31.777 --> 01:24:33.320
Run it. Run it.

2221
01:24:33.403 --> 01:24:34.905
What's going on here?

2222
01:24:36.156 --> 01:24:37.658
- Follow him! I'm
open! I'm open!

2223
01:24:37.741 --> 01:24:39.381
- He's gettin' the ball.
- Run it, run it.

2224
01:24:39.451 --> 01:24:40.661
Lock him off, lock him off.

2225
01:24:40.744 --> 01:24:41.763
She's passing to the midget!

2226
01:24:41.787 --> 01:24:43.247
Wait for it. Now!

2227
01:24:43.330 --> 01:24:44.706
Throw that bitch,
Ghost! Let it go!

2228
01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:46.333
What the f... Who's
she throwing it to?

2229
01:24:50.796 --> 01:24:52.548
<i>America loves an underdog.</i>

2230
01:24:53.841 --> 01:24:55.008
<i>The slept on.</i>

2231
01:24:55.717 --> 01:24:56.844
<i>The little guy.</i>

2232
01:24:57.427 --> 01:24:59.805
<i>The one no one believes
can achieve greatness.</i>

2233
01:24:59.888 --> 01:25:01.265
Good catch! Get to the house!

2234
01:25:01.348 --> 01:25:03.225
Tackle him! Tackle him!

2235
01:25:03.308 --> 01:25:05.185
<i>But you know what
they love more?</i>

2236
01:25:06.061 --> 01:25:07.271
<i>Nothin'.</i>

2237
01:25:07.354 --> 01:25:08.981
<i>Because watchin' underdogs win</i>

2238
01:25:09.690 --> 01:25:11.859
<i>is some seriously
inspiring shit.</i>

2239
01:25:22.202 --> 01:25:23.245
Fuck!

2240
01:25:23.328 --> 01:25:25.414
Yes! I did it!

2241
01:25:25.998 --> 01:25:27.541
I did it!

2242
01:25:28.041 --> 01:25:29.668
Oh, my...

2243
01:25:30.210 --> 01:25:31.670
- Tony.

2244
01:25:34.298 --> 01:25:35.424
Fuck!

2245
01:25:35.507 --> 01:25:36.717
Fuck!

2246
01:25:37.426 --> 01:25:40.137
<i>But watching them lose
in devastating fashion...</i>

2247
01:25:43.181 --> 01:25:44.433
It was right there.

2248
01:25:51.356 --> 01:25:52.357
You all right?

2249
01:25:56.111 --> 01:25:58.906
<i>Well, that shit turns out
to be even more inspiring.</i>

2250
01:26:00.991 --> 01:26:03.327
Aye, at least you
held on to that titty.

2251
01:26:10.542 --> 01:26:12.419
<i>Fuck the scoreboard.</i>

2252
01:26:12.502 --> 01:26:15.088
<i>Fuck the cheap-ass
plastic trophy.</i>

2253
01:26:15.172 --> 01:26:17.132
<i>Fuck the bitch-ass,
punk-ass bitches</i>

2254
01:26:17.215 --> 01:26:18.759
<i>that think they better than you.</i>

2255
01:26:19.509 --> 01:26:20.820
Ain't nothin' to be
sad about, Titties.

2256
01:26:20.844 --> 01:26:23.055
Y'all played y'all
asses off today.

2257
01:26:23.138 --> 01:26:24.389
From the moment I came out here

2258
01:26:24.473 --> 01:26:26.183
as y'all coach till today,

2259
01:26:26.975 --> 01:26:28.310
y'all made me proud.

2260
01:26:28.852 --> 01:26:30.437
Y'all made me a different man.

2261
01:26:31.104 --> 01:26:32.147
I love y'all.

2262
01:26:32.773 --> 01:26:34.876
Keep your head up. Come on,
your family wanna see you.

2263
01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:36.360
- Let's go.

2264
01:26:36.777 --> 01:26:38.463
<i>One little bullshit</i> -
<i>ass setback ain't nothin'</i>

2265
01:26:38.487 --> 01:26:40.697
<i>after a lifetime of
bullshit-ass setbacks.</i>

2266
01:26:40.781 --> 01:26:42.258
- That's all right, baby.
- We love you!

2267
01:26:42.282 --> 01:26:43.575
Heads up, heads up!

2268
01:26:43.659 --> 01:26:44.660
It's okay!

2269
01:26:45.702 --> 01:26:46.745
Yeah.

2270
01:26:47.996 --> 01:26:48.997
Wow.

2271
01:26:49.456 --> 01:26:50.832
Put that chin up.

2272
01:26:50.916 --> 01:26:51.917
Way to go, superstar.

2273
01:26:52.417 --> 01:26:53.585
Superstar?

2274
01:26:54.086 --> 01:26:56.546
What can I say? I'm a Jedi
mind-trickin' mothafucker.

2275
01:26:58.048 --> 01:26:59.567
- Love you, Coach.
- I love you too, son.

2276
01:26:59.591 --> 01:27:00.592
Go celebrate.

2277
01:27:00.968 --> 01:27:02.761
Champions again!

2278
01:27:02.844 --> 01:27:04.805
Champions again!

2279
01:27:05.931 --> 01:27:07.683
All right, y'all.

2280
01:27:07.766 --> 01:27:09.369
You know what's happenin'. We
gotta go shake their hands,

2281
01:27:09.393 --> 01:27:11.728
- let's go.

2282
01:27:11.812 --> 01:27:13.563
Offense doesn't
win championship!

2283
01:27:13.647 --> 01:27:15.273
Defense doesn't
win championship!

2284
01:27:15.357 --> 01:27:17.776
- Coaching wins championships!
- Yo, Coach.

2285
01:27:18.318 --> 01:27:19.569
Oh.

2286
01:27:20.362 --> 01:27:21.613
Good game.

2287
01:27:24.366 --> 01:27:25.534
Thank you. Good game, Coach.

2288
01:27:26.702 --> 01:27:28.745
Got a talented group here.

2289
01:27:29.705 --> 01:27:31.748
Aye, but don't get
it twisted though.

2290
01:27:31.832 --> 01:27:33.750
We gonna fuck you
mothafuckers up next season.

2291
01:27:34.876 --> 01:27:35.961
No cap.

2292
01:27:54.104 --> 01:27:55.397
What if I...

2293
01:27:56.273 --> 01:27:58.316
told you, hypothetically...

2294
01:27:59.526 --> 01:28:00.694
I was really proud of you.

2295
01:28:01.862 --> 01:28:04.114
I would say you
was feelin' me...

2296
01:28:04.614 --> 01:28:06.074
hypothetically, of course.

2297
01:28:06.158 --> 01:28:07.409
Right.

2298
01:28:11.997 --> 01:28:13.165
You still smoke?

2299
01:28:21.339 --> 01:28:23.175
<i>One defeat doesn't
mean you're defeated.</i>

2300
01:28:24.259 --> 01:28:26.219
<i>That shit only makes
an underdog hungrier.</i>

2301
01:28:26.845 --> 01:28:30.265
<i>Hungrier for the next
opportunity to defy the odds</i>

2302
01:28:30.348 --> 01:28:32.267
<i>and come back
stronger than ever.</i>

2303
01:28:32.350 --> 01:28:33.351
<i>Because, you see,</i>

2304
01:28:33.727 --> 01:28:35.062
<i>the true power of the underdog</i>

2305
01:28:35.687 --> 01:28:38.523
<i>is that they never let
themselves be beat.</i>

2306
01:28:39.608 --> 01:28:40.942
<i>And at the end of the day,</i>

2307
01:28:41.651 --> 01:28:43.445
<i>right there is the definition</i>

2308
01:28:44.071 --> 01:28:46.823
<i>of ultimate
mothafuckin' greatness.</i>
