2
00:01:04.456 --> 00:01:05.858
911, what's your emergency?

3
00:01:05.892 --> 00:01:08.360
My husband, something's wrong,
he's not listening to me.

4
00:01:08.393 --> 00:01:10.262
All right, ma'am,
I need you to remain calm.

5
00:01:10.295 --> 00:01:11.931
Can you tell me what's wrong
with your husband?

6
00:01:11.964 --> 00:01:13.432
He's not talking or listening,

7
00:01:13.465 --> 00:01:14.901
he just keeps walking
into the forest.

8
00:01:14.934 --> 00:01:16.669
Does he have any history
of sleepwalking?

9
00:01:16.703 --> 00:01:18.336
No, he never does this.

10
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.806
All right,
I need you to stay calm.

11
00:01:22.574 --> 00:01:24.509
911, please state
your emergency.

12
00:01:24.543 --> 00:01:26.378
I don't know
what the fuck is going on,

13
00:01:26.411 --> 00:01:28.280
but you're gonna need
to send somebody out here quick

14
00:01:28.313 --> 00:01:29.614
to see this shit.

15
00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:32.551
911.

16
00:01:32.584 --> 00:01:35.655
I think someone
is talking to me.

17
00:01:35.688 --> 00:01:37.589
I hear a voice.

18
00:01:37.622 --> 00:01:40.358
Ma'am, is there somebody
there with you?

19
00:01:40.392 --> 00:01:41.661
No, there's nobody.

20
00:01:41.694 --> 00:01:42.929
There's nobody here.

21
00:01:45.898 --> 00:01:48.500
Uh, I'm trapped in my room.

22
00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:50.870
There's something
blocking my door.

23
00:01:50.903 --> 00:01:52.805
Sir, can you describe it?

24
00:01:52.839 --> 00:01:55.775
Um, no.

25
00:01:55.808 --> 00:01:57.309
I can't.

26
00:01:58.745 --> 00:02:00.278
How many of them are there?

27
00:02:00.312 --> 00:02:03.015
Uh, like six or seven of them.

28
00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.751
What are they doing now?

29
00:02:04.784 --> 00:02:08.353
They're just standing there
staring at it.

30
00:02:08.386 --> 00:02:09.722
Should I get my gun?

31
00:02:09.756 --> 00:02:11.858
No, sir, don't do that.

32
00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.596
Let's go.

33
00:02:51.631 --> 00:02:53.565
Make sure all your phones
are turned off

34
00:02:53.598 --> 00:02:56.501
and not on silent, thank you.

35
00:02:56.535 --> 00:02:57.837
Come on.

36
00:03:11.884 --> 00:03:14.386
All right, guys.

37
00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.489
Your time starts now, one hour.

38
00:03:36.042 --> 00:03:38.110
Hey, I need to go
to the bathroom.

39
00:03:38.144 --> 00:03:39.946
No, you don't, Jake.

40
00:03:53.592 --> 00:03:55.161
Hey.

41
00:03:55.194 --> 00:03:57.630
That's for Lizzie,
can you pass it to her?

42
00:04:09.075 --> 00:04:10.877
Let's hear what you got.

43
00:04:17.683 --> 00:04:19.752
I wanna hear it, let's go.

44
00:04:19.785 --> 00:04:22.822
"Wanna Netflix at mine,
then make out a little? LOL."

45
00:04:26.993 --> 00:04:29.695
Okay, I know
you didn't write that.

46
00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.631
Jake, why are you being stupid?

47
00:04:31.664 --> 00:04:33.199
What, it wasn't me, it was her!

48
00:04:33.232 --> 00:04:35.533
I'm not a her!

49
00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:40.006
Look, just
no more talking, okay?

50
00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.074
Everybody get back to work.

51
00:06:16.002 --> 00:06:18.536
Slow down, please, slow down.

52
00:06:20.773 --> 00:06:22.141
What's going on?

53
00:06:30.716 --> 00:06:33.686
Okay, just hang on, okay?

54
00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:36.188
Just sit tight, okay?

55
00:06:36.222 --> 00:06:39.759
Let me see what I can do,
all right?

56
00:06:39.792 --> 00:06:41.327
Okay.

57
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.297
Class, I need
to finish this outside.

58
00:06:45.331 --> 00:06:47.733
Rory, you're gonna be my eyes
in the sky, okay?

59
00:06:47.767 --> 00:06:49.601
Everyone listen to Rory,

60
00:06:49.635 --> 00:06:51.603
and I'll be right back, okay?

61
00:06:51.637 --> 00:06:53.571
Can I go to the bathroom now?

62
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.002
Yeah, fuck this.

63
00:07:23.035 --> 00:07:25.071
Jake, can you be quiet?

64
00:07:25.104 --> 00:07:26.372
Is nobody else
hearing this shit?

65
00:07:26.405 --> 00:07:27.873
Dude, I'm gonna tell
Mr. Johnson.

66
00:07:27.907 --> 00:07:29.275
No, I'm not gonna pretend
things are fine

67
00:07:29.308 --> 00:07:31.609
just 'cause Mr. Johnson did.

68
00:07:31.644 --> 00:07:33.045
Shit is clearly going down.

69
00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:34.346
How do you know?

70
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.948
For one, that fucking cabinet

71
00:07:35.981 --> 00:07:38.117
sounds like
there's a huge dil...

72
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.019
looks like it's gonna explode,

73
00:07:40.052 --> 00:07:41.987
and two, did you guys see
Mr. Johnson's face?

74
00:07:42.021 --> 00:07:45.224
That was a total
"shit's going down" face.

75
00:07:45.257 --> 00:07:47.793
The guy cannot hold his bluff.

76
00:08:00.139 --> 00:08:02.274
Jake, as stand-in
substitute teacher,

77
00:08:02.308 --> 00:08:05.277
- I want you to sit down.
- That's not even real.

78
00:08:13.919 --> 00:08:15.921
Hello, this is the office.

79
00:08:15.955 --> 00:08:20.860
Um, we're initiating a lockdown
for anyone on campus,

80
00:08:20.893 --> 00:08:23.362
so please stay in the classroom

81
00:08:23.395 --> 00:08:26.031
if you're still on campus

82
00:08:26.065 --> 00:08:27.733
and wait
for further instructions.

83
00:08:27.766 --> 00:08:28.934
Do not attempt to leave.

84
00:08:28.968 --> 00:08:31.871
Stay in the classroom.
Thank you.

85
00:08:31.904 --> 00:08:33.672
Hear how she sounded?

86
00:08:33.706 --> 00:08:34.974
She sounded
just like Mr. Johnson.

87
00:08:35.007 --> 00:08:36.442
- That means...
- Shit's going down.

88
00:08:36.475 --> 00:08:38.244
I wonder if it's Brandon.

89
00:08:38.277 --> 00:08:41.113
I know he collects, like,
shotguns and rifles and shit.

90
00:08:41.147 --> 00:08:42.715
I don't wanna get shot.

91
00:08:42.748 --> 00:08:45.050
- And what do you suggest?
- We should get our phones

92
00:08:45.084 --> 00:08:47.119
out of this locked
vibrating cabinet,

93
00:08:47.153 --> 00:08:50.055
but I'm not The Rock,
so we can't.

94
00:08:51.457 --> 00:08:55.261
Why'd he take his fucking keys?

95
00:09:12.945 --> 00:09:15.247
Yes, yes, that's right,
it seems to be hovering

96
00:09:15.281 --> 00:09:17.917
maybe two, three feet
above the ground.

97
00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:21.353
Military personnel
won't let us get close...

98
00:09:21.387 --> 00:09:23.022
I'm sorry, we're having trouble
hearing you.

99
00:09:23.055 --> 00:09:26.458
I said we're not able
to get any closer...

100
00:09:26.492 --> 00:09:28.360
Paul, you still there?

101
00:09:28.394 --> 00:09:29.495
Yeah, I'm still here.

102
00:09:29.528 --> 00:09:34.033
There seems to be a local man
walking towards this...

103
00:09:34.066 --> 00:09:37.736
He's just walking towards
the object and it seems...

104
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.471
- Paul?
- We're not able

105
00:09:39.505 --> 00:09:42.908
- to get any closer to this...
- Stand down, sir.

106
00:09:42.942 --> 00:09:44.376
Stand down!

107
00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:45.911
They're raising their weapons
on the man.

108
00:09:45.945 --> 00:09:48.314
- I said stay where you are!
- Oh, fuck, oh, shi...

109
00:09:51.317 --> 00:09:53.085
Let's get our phones.

110
00:10:01.227 --> 00:10:02.928
Okay, here.

111
00:10:02.962 --> 00:10:04.797
Um...

112
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.398
Rory, what are you doing?

113
00:10:06.432 --> 00:10:08.334
Hiding from the shooter.

114
00:10:08.367 --> 00:10:09.768
Okay.

115
00:10:12.871 --> 00:10:16.075
Uh, I don't think
it's a shooter.

116
00:10:16.108 --> 00:10:18.811
I got three missed calls
from my mom.

117
00:10:18.844 --> 00:10:22.881
That's weird,
she never fucking calls me.

118
00:10:22.915 --> 00:10:25.117
Nobody seems to know
why the school's on lockdown.

119
00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.086
I think we need to leave.

120
00:10:27.119 --> 00:10:27.987
It's a lockdown.

121
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.089
That means we stay
locked down, right?

122
00:10:30.122 --> 00:10:32.057
Shut up, I'm trying
to call my mom.

123
00:10:32.091 --> 00:10:34.226
Dude, our teacher
didn't come back for us.

124
00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.427
Nobody else is here.

125
00:10:35.461 --> 00:10:37.029
Fuck, why is she not
picking up?

126
00:10:37.062 --> 00:10:39.198
You're just speculating.

127
00:10:39.231 --> 00:10:40.432
What am I speculating about?

128
00:10:40.466 --> 00:10:42.301
This is a frickin' lockdown.

129
00:10:42.334 --> 00:10:44.169
What if it's aliens?

130
00:10:57.249 --> 00:10:58.884
Ash.

131
00:11:03.856 --> 00:11:05.457
- Jesus.
- Fuck.

132
00:11:11.196 --> 00:11:13.198
What the fuck?

133
00:11:16.368 --> 00:11:17.870
Fuck.

134
00:11:26.445 --> 00:11:28.580
I think this is
a good time to go.

135
00:11:28.614 --> 00:11:30.516
Jake, we don't even know
what's out there.

136
00:11:30.549 --> 00:11:32.351
Out there is the exit.

137
00:11:32.384 --> 00:11:34.353
We want to exit
the situation, right?

138
00:11:34.386 --> 00:11:36.055
What? No.

139
00:11:36.088 --> 00:11:37.556
We do what's reasonable,
I mean, come on,

140
00:11:37.589 --> 00:11:40.159
remember Mr. Johnson's
scared shitless face?

141
00:11:40.192 --> 00:11:43.128
He didn't come back for us,
we're on our own.

142
00:11:43.162 --> 00:11:46.198
Or maybe he couldn't come back.

143
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.102
Fucking jets.

144
00:11:50.135 --> 00:11:51.103
It's like death
,

145
00:11:51.136 --> 00:11:52.271
let's go, let's go.

146
00:11:52.304 --> 00:11:55.040
No, it doesn't feel safe
out there.

147
00:11:58.344 --> 00:12:00.012
Nowhere is safe.

148
00:12:00.045 --> 00:12:01.480
I say we move out.

149
00:12:37.282 --> 00:12:39.318
Ash.

150
00:12:39.351 --> 00:12:41.420
What's wrong?

151
00:12:41.453 --> 00:12:43.222
There's something there.

152
00:12:58.671 --> 00:13:00.205
Holy shit.

153
00:13:01.708 --> 00:13:03.242
What is that?

154
00:13:03.275 --> 00:13:04.943
I... I don't know.

155
00:13:18.323 --> 00:13:20.325
What is that thing?

156
00:13:22.361 --> 00:13:25.097
It's taking up
the whole hallway.

157
00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:27.499
Does that mean
we can't get out?

158
00:13:39.511 --> 00:13:42.147
Fuck.

159
00:13:42.181 --> 00:13:44.416
"Report object
to authorities ASAP"?

160
00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:46.051
"Get the fuck out
if you see one."

161
00:13:46.084 --> 00:13:48.987
"Reported missing persons:
4,200."

162
00:13:49.021 --> 00:13:51.190
"If you hear voices,
go to the hospital."

163
00:13:51.223 --> 00:13:53.492
Some people are saying
it's talking to them.

164
00:14:12.177 --> 00:14:14.213
Holy shit.

165
00:14:14.246 --> 00:14:16.248
That shouldn't happen.

166
00:14:16.281 --> 00:14:17.750
No, it fucking shouldn't.

167
00:14:26.325 --> 00:14:28.628
Maybe it's transporting them
somewhere.

168
00:14:30.562 --> 00:14:33.398
Why does everything you say
have to sound super scary?

169
00:14:33.432 --> 00:14:36.335
M... maybe everyone's
on the other side of it?

170
00:14:36.368 --> 00:14:38.470
Hello?

171
00:14:38.504 --> 00:14:41.373
Mr. Johnson, I don't wanna be
in charge anymore.

172
00:14:54.687 --> 00:14:56.455
Let's find another way out.

173
00:14:56.488 --> 00:14:58.390
What if we go inside it?

174
00:15:00.827 --> 00:15:02.762
Uh, okay?

175
00:15:02.795 --> 00:15:05.097
You're a weirdo
and you're crazy.

176
00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:06.565
It's official.

177
00:15:06.598 --> 00:15:10.335
What are you talking about?

178
00:15:10.369 --> 00:15:13.372
Maybe it takes us somewhere.

179
00:15:13.405 --> 00:15:17.075
Like somewhere else.

180
00:15:17.109 --> 00:15:18.745
I don't want to go
somewhere else,

181
00:15:18.778 --> 00:15:22.114
I want to just get
the fuck outta here.

182
00:15:22.147 --> 00:15:23.248
I'm with Jake.

183
00:15:23.282 --> 00:15:24.651
You're crazy.

184
00:15:29.154 --> 00:15:30.723
There might be an exit up here.

185
00:15:30.757 --> 00:15:32.190
Maybe it's a bathroom.

186
00:15:32.224 --> 00:15:34.092
Who the hell knows
at this point?

187
00:15:59.752 --> 00:16:00.887
Ash.

188
00:16:21.406 --> 00:16:23.575
Ash, what are you thinking?

189
00:16:26.478 --> 00:16:29.581
I was just getting
a closer look.

190
00:16:29.615 --> 00:16:30.650
Ash.

191
00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:34.453
You can tell me anything.

192
00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:09.621
What the fuck was that?

193
00:17:09.656 --> 00:17:11.758
Jake, please, stop.

194
00:17:18.965 --> 00:17:20.967
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

195
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.535
You need to calm down.

196
00:17:32.277 --> 00:17:33.646
- Don't touch her.
- Guys, stop.

197
00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.447
Jake, it's okay.

198
00:17:38.651 --> 00:17:39.652
You know what, yeah, no,

199
00:17:39.686 --> 00:17:42.587
I'm not gonna play this game.

200
00:17:44.791 --> 00:17:46.726
I don't fucking fight girls.

201
00:17:49.729 --> 00:17:51.998
What are you doing?

202
00:17:52.031 --> 00:17:53.900
Guys, stop it!

203
00:17:56.334 --> 00:17:57.637
Guys!

204
00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:59.005
- God, you guys, stop it.
- I don't have my glasses,

205
00:17:59.038 --> 00:18:01.440
I can't see.

206
00:18:01.473 --> 00:18:02.541
Watch out!

207
00:18:07.546 --> 00:18:08.781
Sorry.

208
00:18:10.717 --> 00:18:13.418
Ash? You okay?

209
00:18:13.452 --> 00:18:15.554
I'm sorry, I just got scared.

210
00:18:15.587 --> 00:18:16.756
I'm sorry!

211
00:18:30.602 --> 00:18:32.805
Did they just...

212
00:18:38.443 --> 00:18:39.444
I'm sorry.

213
00:18:39.478 --> 00:18:41.781
I didn't mean to.

214
00:18:41.814 --> 00:18:42.982
I couldn't see them.

215
00:18:43.015 --> 00:18:44.817
Why would you do that?

216
00:18:44.851 --> 00:18:45.885
I was just trying
to defend mys...

217
00:18:45.918 --> 00:18:47.586
No.

218
00:19:05.071 --> 00:19:07.472
It's all my fault.

219
00:19:12.544 --> 00:19:14.446
Ash?

220
00:19:14.479 --> 00:19:16.082
Ash, what are you doing?

221
00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.497
Fuck.

222
00:19:47.113 --> 00:19:48.815
Rory?

223
00:19:52.852 --> 00:19:54.519
Jake?

224
00:19:59.591 --> 00:20:00.860
Ash.

225
00:21:30.883 --> 00:21:33.485
Hey, folks,
it's Martin Midnight,

226
00:21:33.518 --> 00:21:36.488
and this is Midnight Buzz

227
00:21:36.521 --> 00:21:38.925
where we explore the strange,

228
00:21:38.958 --> 00:21:40.159
the paranormal,

229
00:21:40.192 --> 00:21:41.994
the unexplained,

230
00:21:42.028 --> 00:21:45.031
and the downright weird
of the week.

231
00:21:45.064 --> 00:21:46.132
Midnighters, welcome.

232
00:21:46.165 --> 00:21:48.734
A big show, we've got a lot
to talk about tonight.

233
00:21:48.768 --> 00:21:50.236
As you probably know,

234
00:21:50.269 --> 00:21:52.504
unless you've been living
in a hole,

235
00:21:52.537 --> 00:21:53.873
these things...
and you know exactly

236
00:21:53.906 --> 00:21:55.708
what I'm talking about,
I think the scientists

237
00:21:55.741 --> 00:21:56.943
have finally named them

238
00:21:56.976 --> 00:21:59.477
a fucking
brilliantly stupid name,

239
00:21:59.511 --> 00:22:02.648
doors... started appearing
all over the world

240
00:22:02.682 --> 00:22:04.116
just a few weeks ago,

241
00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:06.886
and as we all know,
shit has been getting

242
00:22:06.919 --> 00:22:11.023
really, really, well, weird.

243
00:22:11.057 --> 00:22:13.491
Many millions
of our loved ones

244
00:22:13.525 --> 00:22:14.860
have gone missing, folks,

245
00:22:14.894 --> 00:22:17.930
and, you know,
many more are presumed dead.

246
00:22:17.964 --> 00:22:20.933
But listen,
the even weirder thing

247
00:22:20.967 --> 00:22:23.002
is that some have returned

248
00:22:23.035 --> 00:22:26.005
from wherever the fuck
they've been.

249
00:22:26.038 --> 00:22:28.107
And the Knockers program,
my God,

250
00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.643
this thing apparently
goes into effect today.

251
00:22:30.676 --> 00:22:31.476
Have you guys heard about this?

252
00:22:31.509 --> 00:22:35.047
This thing has
literal volunteers,

253
00:22:35.081 --> 00:22:39.885
people volunteering
to go into the doors.

254
00:22:39.919 --> 00:22:44.657
Yeah, the same things
that cause people to kill

255
00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:47.693
or make people go crazy.

256
00:22:47.727 --> 00:22:50.763
You know, it's fucking baffling.

257
00:22:50.796 --> 00:22:52.898
I don't know what's more stupid:

258
00:22:52.932 --> 00:22:54.767
the offensive term "Knockers,"

259
00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:55.901
I mean, come on,

260
00:22:55.935 --> 00:22:58.637
or the people who think
it's a good idea

261
00:22:58.671 --> 00:23:02.274
for civilians
to go into a door.

262
00:23:02.308 --> 00:23:06.611
But we'll see in
the next 24 hours, I guess.

263
00:23:06.645 --> 00:23:08.647
Good luck, volunteers.

264
00:23:26.832 --> 00:23:29.035
I'm an incubator of life.

265
00:23:31.037 --> 00:23:32.738
I can't move.

266
00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.176
I'm stuck.

267
00:23:37.209 --> 00:23:39.912
Waiting.

268
00:23:39.945 --> 00:23:42.314
Always waiting for a wave.

269
00:23:46.385 --> 00:23:48.821
You're a wave.

270
00:23:48.854 --> 00:23:51.724
You flow.

271
00:23:51.757 --> 00:23:53.692
You rage.

272
00:23:57.129 --> 00:24:00.766
You exist by being shapeless,

273
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:06.305
yet I exist only through shape.

274
00:24:06.338 --> 00:24:10.176
The shape that you created.

275
00:24:10.209 --> 00:24:12.845
I'm blocked.

276
00:24:12.878 --> 00:24:14.612
I'm trapped.

277
00:24:16.382 --> 00:24:18.651
A prisoner to the ocean...

278
00:24:20.719 --> 00:24:23.189
...waiting for
your shapeless form

279
00:24:23.222 --> 00:24:25.191
to consume me,

280
00:24:25.224 --> 00:24:27.760
and I fucking hate it.

281
00:24:34.033 --> 00:24:36.969
I don't know,
that's all I've got so far.

282
00:24:38.671 --> 00:24:40.372
I like it!

283
00:24:40.406 --> 00:24:44.276
I love how badass
you made the waves.

284
00:24:46.679 --> 00:24:48.647
It's like, you know,
billions of years

285
00:24:48.681 --> 00:24:51.350
of just shaping each other.

286
00:24:51.383 --> 00:24:53.419
It's unreal.

287
00:24:53.452 --> 00:24:55.121
Poor rocks.

288
00:24:57.156 --> 00:24:59.191
It kind of sucks.

289
00:25:00.993 --> 00:25:03.395
They're rocks.

290
00:25:03.429 --> 00:25:07.166
That's their purpose,
they don't have a choice.

291
00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:14.240
You worried about the rocks?

292
00:25:14.273 --> 00:25:16.175
Rocks got you down?

293
00:25:17.376 --> 00:25:20.146
You wanna do some rock therapy?

294
00:25:20.179 --> 00:25:21.714
I'm a good listener!

295
00:25:21.747 --> 00:25:22.915
I really am!

296
00:25:22.948 --> 00:25:24.750
- No.
- All right.

297
00:25:24.783 --> 00:25:26.185
Rocks are tough.

298
00:25:26.218 --> 00:25:27.786
Like you.

299
00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.054
They're tough, they're strong,

300
00:25:29.088 --> 00:25:31.824
they're independent women
like you.

301
00:25:39.999 --> 00:25:41.800
Phaser set to kill, Captain.

302
00:25:41.834 --> 00:25:43.903
Okay, let's practice
some gun safety.

303
00:25:43.936 --> 00:25:45.437
All right?

304
00:26:50.269 --> 00:26:51.303
So you're telling me
you really wouldn't want

305
00:26:51.337 --> 00:26:53.339
to live here, huh?

306
00:26:53.372 --> 00:26:55.808
Too moody and kinda cold.

307
00:26:55.841 --> 00:26:59.445
Well, it's the future,
just stay inside.

308
00:26:59.478 --> 00:27:02.114
How come you never ask me
where I wanna live, huh?

309
00:27:04.116 --> 00:27:06.418
Where do you wanna live, Beck?

310
00:27:06.452 --> 00:27:08.487
Did I mention I love you?

311
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.222
Not while you're this Vince.

312
00:27:10.256 --> 00:27:12.858
I don't like this Vince either.

313
00:27:12.891 --> 00:27:15.327
What Vince do you want?

314
00:27:15.361 --> 00:27:17.096
You gotta ask it on your own.

315
00:27:17.129 --> 00:27:20.065
Yo, Knockers!

316
00:27:20.099 --> 00:27:21.400
Got eyes on them.

317
00:27:21.433 --> 00:27:22.901
Where you been?

318
00:27:22.935 --> 00:27:25.337
- You gotta bump it, dude.
- Knockers inbound.

319
00:27:25.371 --> 00:27:27.339
Now you may speak.

320
00:27:27.373 --> 00:27:28.841
My guys confirmed
that the house structure

321
00:27:28.874 --> 00:27:30.376
is stable enough for now.

322
00:27:52.031 --> 00:27:53.999
Poor rocks.

323
00:27:58.137 --> 00:28:00.406
How do they stand it
for so long?

324
00:28:05.411 --> 00:28:07.479
I don't want to be a rock.

325
00:28:22.294 --> 00:28:25.397
I want to be a wave.

326
00:28:25.431 --> 00:28:27.566
Three cans, please.

327
00:28:30.569 --> 00:28:32.471
- Where's Prince?
- No, no, sideways,

328
00:28:32.504 --> 00:28:34.006
take it sideways, sideways.

329
00:28:34.039 --> 00:28:35.174
Take it, take it now.

330
00:28:35.207 --> 00:28:37.009
- Take it now.
- Oh, God.

331
00:28:37.042 --> 00:28:38.277
So I've been thinking about it,

332
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:40.045
that thing with the birds?

333
00:28:40.079 --> 00:28:42.214
So you know every time
Whiz does that thing?

334
00:28:42.247 --> 00:28:44.483
You know, when it kind of
throws off our compass,

335
00:28:44.516 --> 00:28:46.552
I think what's happening

336
00:28:46.585 --> 00:28:48.187
is the same thing
with the birds.

337
00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:50.322
He does the thing, they die,
they fall out of the sky.

338
00:28:50.356 --> 00:28:52.458
- That makes sense.
- It's just a theory, but...

339
00:28:56.095 --> 00:28:57.196
You guys ready to get weird?

340
00:28:57.229 --> 00:28:59.164
Can you get this?

341
00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:07.973
You guys are too cute.

342
00:29:08.006 --> 00:29:09.608
You got your phaser, Becky?

343
00:29:09.642 --> 00:29:11.210
Right here,
and it's set to kill.

344
00:29:11.243 --> 00:29:14.113
- Don't shoot.
- KT421, this is HQ,

345
00:29:14.146 --> 00:29:17.483
- do you copy?
- KT421, copy.

346
00:29:17.516 --> 00:29:19.385
KT421, you have been
given green light

347
00:29:19.418 --> 00:29:20.619
to enter your door.

348
00:29:20.653 --> 00:29:22.321
You have a go-ahead.

349
00:29:22.354 --> 00:29:24.223
Copy that, it's about time.

350
00:29:24.256 --> 00:29:25.624
I also want to remind
you that your boys

351
00:29:25.658 --> 00:29:28.160
only have 12 minutes
to get out.

352
00:29:28.193 --> 00:29:30.496
Um, sorry, ma'am,
did you say 12 minutes?

353
00:29:30.529 --> 00:29:33.265
The Astoria team got 15,
what's up with that?

354
00:29:33.298 --> 00:29:36.101
Well, Astoria team
didn't make it.

355
00:29:36.135 --> 00:29:37.936
So that's your new time,
Lieutenant.

356
00:29:40.105 --> 00:29:41.106
Wait, what was that?

357
00:29:43.242 --> 00:29:45.544
I keep getting
this fucking Spanish station.

358
00:30:31.356 --> 00:30:32.624
What is this?

359
00:30:47.606 --> 00:30:48.741
Knockers, come in.

360
00:30:48.775 --> 00:30:50.509
You guys got 12 minutes
inside that door.

361
00:30:50.542 --> 00:30:52.344
- You hear me?
- Yeah, copy.

362
00:30:52.377 --> 00:30:54.480
Entering the house now.

363
00:30:54.513 --> 00:30:56.615
Why is he so fucking annoying?

364
00:30:56.649 --> 00:30:58.484
Your mic's still on, Becky.

365
00:31:04.189 --> 00:31:05.357
Knockers here.

366
00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:06.659
It seems as though the door

367
00:31:06.693 --> 00:31:09.194
is pulling shit towards it.

368
00:31:09.228 --> 00:31:11.597
Huh.

369
00:31:11.631 --> 00:31:14.166
Unit K138 approaching our door.

370
00:31:22.441 --> 00:31:24.176
This one's huge.

371
00:31:24.209 --> 00:31:26.713
- That's what she said.
- Ew.

372
00:31:30.549 --> 00:31:32.752
I don't want to be a rock.

373
00:31:32.785 --> 00:31:35.454
Whoa, did you guys hear that?

374
00:31:35.487 --> 00:31:38.156
Yeah.

375
00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:40.259
Smooth jazz.

376
00:31:40.292 --> 00:31:42.361
Whiz, begin that timer.

377
00:31:42.394 --> 00:31:43.730
Don't lose your shit
in there, guys.

378
00:31:43.763 --> 00:31:46.498
Three, two, one.

379
00:32:04.383 --> 00:32:06.184
Welcome.

380
00:32:14.526 --> 00:32:17.764
Did we just beam in?

381
00:32:17.797 --> 00:32:20.198
Dreams do come true.

382
00:32:20.232 --> 00:32:22.702
Looks like we're on
the other side of the house.

383
00:32:22.735 --> 00:32:25.805
Room is void of color,
but kinda cool.

384
00:32:25.838 --> 00:32:29.474
Doesn't seem to be
the same house.

385
00:32:29.508 --> 00:32:31.109
Did this room get bigger?

386
00:32:31.143 --> 00:32:33.646
Maybe. I see three doorways.

387
00:32:40.687 --> 00:32:42.554
All right, where to first?

388
00:32:42.588 --> 00:32:44.724
I call dibs
on this pink hallway.

389
00:32:44.757 --> 00:32:46.425
If we split up,
we can document more.

390
00:32:46.458 --> 00:32:48.695
Yeah, I'm not sure
that's a good idea.

391
00:32:48.728 --> 00:32:50.529
Cool.

392
00:32:50.562 --> 00:32:52.264
Beck, you know,
we don't all have a gun.

393
00:32:52.297 --> 00:32:53.800
It's a phaser!

394
00:32:59.371 --> 00:33:02.240
You have 11 minutes remaining.

395
00:33:30.737 --> 00:33:34.641
Lights don't work.

396
00:33:34.674 --> 00:33:37.442
The symmetry is pretty dope.

397
00:33:37.476 --> 00:33:39.578
Upload this shit.

398
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:53.492
Hello?

399
00:34:00.365 --> 00:34:03.402
I think I found something.

400
00:34:03.435 --> 00:34:06.204
Dead leaves scattered
on the floor,

401
00:34:06.238 --> 00:34:08.407
not a good sign.

402
00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.308
Keep it together, Pat.

403
00:34:10.342 --> 00:34:12.812
It's not anything
you can't handle.

404
00:34:33.398 --> 00:34:36.435
Source of sound appears
to be coming from a woman.

405
00:34:36.468 --> 00:34:38.871
Why are you looking at me
like that?

406
00:34:40.807 --> 00:34:44.242
Possible door entity.

407
00:34:44.276 --> 00:34:50.016
She appears to be
very, very real.

408
00:34:50.049 --> 00:34:52.417
I'm in some sort of room.

409
00:34:52.451 --> 00:34:54.486
Flowers.

410
00:34:54.519 --> 00:34:56.823
What the fuck is going on?

411
00:34:56.856 --> 00:34:59.992
Excuse me, do you have a name?

412
00:35:00.026 --> 00:35:02.628
How can you not remember
my name?

413
00:35:02.662 --> 00:35:06.431
It's Rose.

414
00:35:06.465 --> 00:35:07.867
No, it's not.

415
00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.737
Nine minutes.

416
00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:24.951
It's a kitchen.

417
00:35:24.984 --> 00:35:26.384
It's all white.

418
00:35:29.889 --> 00:35:35.995
There's various objects
facing weird directions.

419
00:35:36.028 --> 00:35:38.631
There's baby bottles
upside down.

420
00:35:43.368 --> 00:35:44.569
There's a cradle.

421
00:35:50.943 --> 00:35:53.980
Seems to be moving on its own.

422
00:35:56.682 --> 00:35:58.450
It's empty.

423
00:36:27.747 --> 00:36:31.416
This rooms seems to be
'80s chic.

424
00:36:31.449 --> 00:36:32.752
Oh, this guy went national!

425
00:36:32.785 --> 00:36:34.486
Nice!

426
00:36:34.519 --> 00:36:35.955
Looks like he played shortstop.

427
00:36:35.988 --> 00:36:39.591
Uh, clock is set
at three o'clock.

428
00:36:39.624 --> 00:36:41.861
Got a weird marble bust here.

429
00:36:41.894 --> 00:36:43.963
What's up, dude?

430
00:36:53.739 --> 00:36:57.944
Appears to be another room
identical to the previous,

431
00:36:57.977 --> 00:37:01.080
but slightly more awesome.

432
00:37:01.113 --> 00:37:02.414
What?

433
00:37:02.447 --> 00:37:05.450
Science nerd beer bong.

434
00:37:05.483 --> 00:37:11.157
This bust seems
a little more melancholy.

435
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:15.928
Uh, this clock's set at six.

436
00:37:15.962 --> 00:37:20.599
Next room, similar to the last.

437
00:37:20.633 --> 00:37:23.636
Got some globe action.

438
00:37:23.669 --> 00:37:27.907
Another slightly pissed bust.

439
00:37:30.176 --> 00:37:32.879
Clock set at nine.

440
00:37:32.912 --> 00:37:36.883
This room is darker,

441
00:37:36.916 --> 00:37:39.886
a little more fucking creepy.

442
00:37:39.919 --> 00:37:45.557
Uh, this bust has
some sort of square eyes.

443
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:06.012
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

444
00:38:06.045 --> 00:38:07.579
Hey, relax.

445
00:38:07.612 --> 00:38:08.781
Can you hear me?

446
00:38:10.548 --> 00:38:11.817
Hey, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on,

447
00:38:11.851 --> 00:38:12.985
listen to my voice,
listen to my voice.

448
00:38:13.019 --> 00:38:13.986
Don't do this to me, I'm sorry.

449
00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:15.087
Come back, come back,
come back, it's okay.

450
00:38:15.121 --> 00:38:17.189
Rose, I'm sorry, stop,
stop, stop, please, please.

451
00:38:17.223 --> 00:38:19.926
Hey, hey.

452
00:38:19.959 --> 00:38:21.694
Come back.

453
00:38:25.064 --> 00:38:27.833
- What the f...
- I miss you, Patty.

454
00:38:33.039 --> 00:38:35.141
Are you gonna leave me again?

455
00:38:45.418 --> 00:38:46.953
Hey.

456
00:38:48.888 --> 00:38:51.223
You feeling better?

457
00:38:53.292 --> 00:38:57.997
Super rough morning.

458
00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:59.899
It's still spotty.

459
00:38:59.932 --> 00:39:02.034
I finished the wall.

460
00:39:06.973 --> 00:39:11.711
Are you ready
for Dr. Chang's class?

461
00:39:11.744 --> 00:39:14.180
I think he likes us.

462
00:39:16.983 --> 00:39:19.251
Hello.

463
00:39:24.023 --> 00:39:27.059
Honey, you okay?

464
00:39:27.093 --> 00:39:29.862
Stay back.

465
00:39:31.964 --> 00:39:34.166
Honey.

466
00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.801
Don't call me that.

467
00:39:35.835 --> 00:39:38.671
Beck, what's wrong?

468
00:39:38.704 --> 00:39:41.841
Is she okay?

469
00:39:41.874 --> 00:39:43.976
What is this?

470
00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:45.211
What is this?

471
00:39:45.244 --> 00:39:47.146
Is the baby okay?

472
00:39:47.179 --> 00:39:48.314
What?

473
00:39:50.316 --> 00:39:51.583
What'd you do to me?

474
00:39:51.616 --> 00:39:55.087
What did I do to you?

475
00:39:55.121 --> 00:39:57.723
Stop this right now.

476
00:39:57.757 --> 00:39:59.959
Stop what?

477
00:39:59.992 --> 00:40:02.294
Do you notice it?

478
00:40:02.328 --> 00:40:05.765
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

479
00:40:17.176 --> 00:40:19.345
We chose to do this together.

480
00:40:19.378 --> 00:40:21.814
I didn't choose this.

481
00:40:21.847 --> 00:40:25.151
Now just put your toy down,
this is ridiculous.

482
00:40:25.184 --> 00:40:27.086
Calm down, Beck.

483
00:40:27.119 --> 00:40:29.055
This isn't good for the baby.

484
00:40:29.088 --> 00:40:32.892
This is the door,
this is the door.

485
00:40:32.925 --> 00:40:35.995
Babe, the door was
three years ago.

486
00:40:36.028 --> 00:40:37.863
No, no.

487
00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:48.307
Caution, five minutes remaining.

488
00:40:54.313 --> 00:40:56.382
Ah, God.

489
00:41:03.789 --> 00:41:05.324
What'd I tell you
about these, okay?

490
00:41:05.357 --> 00:41:07.359
How many times?

491
00:41:23.709 --> 00:41:25.277
What the fuck?

492
00:41:56.342 --> 00:41:58.777
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

493
00:42:36.248 --> 00:42:38.851
- Do you need your meds?
- No!

494
00:42:38.884 --> 00:42:40.352
You okay?

495
00:42:40.386 --> 00:42:42.388
Ugh!

496
00:42:45.224 --> 00:42:47.026
- Babe, it's okay.
- I'm not your babe.

497
00:42:47.059 --> 00:42:49.295
Come on, look at me.

498
00:42:49.328 --> 00:42:51.830
Babe, stop, babe, it's okay.

499
00:42:57.436 --> 00:42:59.338
Babe.

500
00:42:59.371 --> 00:43:00.873
Come on.

501
00:43:00.906 --> 00:43:02.474
You're gonna
murder me with a toy?

502
00:43:02.508 --> 00:43:04.410
- Really?
- It's not a toy.

503
00:43:04.443 --> 00:43:06.478
We chose this, baby, just,

504
00:43:06.512 --> 00:43:08.247
just put the toy down.

505
00:43:11.283 --> 00:43:13.819
Come on.

506
00:43:13.852 --> 00:43:16.021
Caution,
three minutes remaining.

507
00:43:16.055 --> 00:43:17.856
It's a phaser.

508
00:44:08.841 --> 00:44:12.044
I re-entered a new room.

509
00:44:30.429 --> 00:44:32.298
It's a picture of me and Beck.

510
00:44:46.512 --> 00:44:48.080
Who the hell are you?

511
00:44:52.518 --> 00:44:55.087
Who the fuck are you?

512
00:45:09.034 --> 00:45:12.371
Caution,
three minutes remaining.

513
00:45:12.404 --> 00:45:14.173
Who are you?

514
00:45:14.206 --> 00:45:17.309
I'm... I'm... I'm in
some kind of hallucination

515
00:45:17.343 --> 00:45:19.178
that looks like
Beck and my apartment.

516
00:45:19.211 --> 00:45:21.513
There are copies of myself,

517
00:45:21.547 --> 00:45:23.949
clearly entities
created by the door.

518
00:45:23.982 --> 00:45:25.451
Wha... what did you call me?

519
00:45:25.484 --> 00:45:28.887
One of the copies is engaging
in a conversation with me.

520
00:45:28.921 --> 00:45:30.589
Yeah, there you go again.

521
00:45:30.622 --> 00:45:31.590
- Caution...
- Beck!

522
00:45:31.623 --> 00:45:32.925
You think you're the real Vince?

523
00:45:32.958 --> 00:45:34.326
Beck, I'm getting
psychosis beeps!

524
00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.095
You really think
you're the real Vince.

525
00:45:36.128 --> 00:45:37.896
Beck, I need help!

526
00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:39.498
What makes you so sure?

527
00:45:39.531 --> 00:45:41.066
- Caution.
- Which one of us

528
00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:42.669
is wearing the suit,
huh, smart guy?

529
00:45:44.704 --> 00:45:46.305
Nice try.

530
00:45:46.338 --> 00:45:47.473
He's right.

531
00:45:49.341 --> 00:45:51.610
This is probably
a hallucination.

532
00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:55.948
We're probably entities.

533
00:45:55.981 --> 00:45:57.216
No, I don't think so.

534
00:45:57.249 --> 00:46:01.220
Man, I told you,
I'm wearing the suit!

535
00:46:01.253 --> 00:46:03.555
I said I got the suit.

536
00:46:07.159 --> 00:46:10.062
Caution,
two minutes remaining.

537
00:46:12.331 --> 00:46:14.066
This isn't happening.

538
00:46:43.128 --> 00:46:44.229
Hey.

539
00:46:55.441 --> 00:46:57.976
This our home?

540
00:46:58.010 --> 00:46:59.311
It's the door.

541
00:46:59.344 --> 00:47:01.480
Okay, that's why you're
seeing these copies.

542
00:47:01.513 --> 00:47:02.682
Copies?

543
00:47:19.565 --> 00:47:22.301
What, what's happening?

544
00:47:27.172 --> 00:47:29.174
- What's happening?
- Babe, look at me,

545
00:47:29.208 --> 00:47:31.744
we're entering psychosis.

546
00:47:31.778 --> 00:47:35.013
- They aren't real.
- Shut up!

547
00:47:37.316 --> 00:47:39.451
Who's the real Vince?

548
00:47:39.485 --> 00:47:42.287
Babe, look at me.

549
00:47:42.321 --> 00:47:45.090
I am.

550
00:47:45.123 --> 00:47:48.460
- I'm real.
- Babe, he's lying.

551
00:47:48.494 --> 00:47:50.562
I'm real.

552
00:47:53.198 --> 00:47:55.067
Maybe it's what we're wearing.

553
00:47:57.202 --> 00:47:58.170
Why are you wearing rain gear?

554
00:47:58.203 --> 00:47:59.371
It's sunny out.

555
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:06.211
Oh, come on.

556
00:48:06.245 --> 00:48:08.213
Come on, since when does
the fuckin' door make sense,

557
00:48:08.247 --> 00:48:10.549
babe, listen!

558
00:48:10.582 --> 00:48:11.718
Babe, listen to me.

559
00:48:18.457 --> 00:48:21.226
Alert.

560
00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:24.329
Get close.

561
00:48:24.363 --> 00:48:25.497
Get close.

562
00:48:29.234 --> 00:48:33.238
Hawaiian shirt, jeans.

563
00:48:33.272 --> 00:48:35.340
Sweater, pants.

564
00:48:35.374 --> 00:48:37.777
Babe, please put the gun down.

565
00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:41.380
Babe, put down the phaser.

566
00:48:41.413 --> 00:48:43.415
What did you say?

567
00:48:43.448 --> 00:48:45.617
Babe, babe,
he's fucking conning you.

568
00:48:45.652 --> 00:48:46.719
Okay, I'm sorry,

569
00:48:46.753 --> 00:48:48.855
I'm sorry that I forgot
that it's a phaser, but...

570
00:48:48.888 --> 00:48:52.190
Told me you were pregnant.

571
00:48:52.224 --> 00:48:54.827
What'd you say?

572
00:48:54.861 --> 00:48:57.195
What did you say?

573
00:48:57.229 --> 00:48:58.163
That day at the beach,

574
00:48:58.196 --> 00:49:01.333
and you said you didn't wanna,

575
00:49:01.366 --> 00:49:03.770
you didn't wanna keep it, but...

576
00:49:03.803 --> 00:49:06.171
Baby.

577
00:49:06.204 --> 00:49:08.240
But then I told you to keep it.

578
00:49:16.515 --> 00:49:17.616
I remember that.

579
00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:18.685
I got a nose bleed,

580
00:49:18.718 --> 00:49:21.119
and it got all over our clothes.

581
00:49:21.153 --> 00:49:22.521
Look at your shirt.

582
00:49:26.558 --> 00:49:29.194
I'm sorry I pushed you.

583
00:49:29.227 --> 00:49:32.397
I'm sorry I lied.

584
00:49:32.431 --> 00:49:36.535
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

585
00:49:40.673 --> 00:49:44.309
He's the real Vince.

586
00:49:44.343 --> 00:49:45.678
Hear that?

587
00:49:45.712 --> 00:49:47.613
I'm the OG.

588
00:49:51.216 --> 00:49:53.251
Sorry, dude, nothing personal.

589
00:50:00.459 --> 00:50:02.527
Danger.

590
00:50:07.399 --> 00:50:09.769
I don't wanna be a rock anymore.

591
00:50:09.802 --> 00:50:11.303
What, what the fuck...

592
00:50:25.952 --> 00:50:27.419
It's my turn.

593
00:50:37.864 --> 00:50:39.732
It's my turn to be a wave.

594
00:50:42.669 --> 00:50:43.836
Okay.

595
00:50:59.986 --> 00:51:02.922
Okay, uh, Midnighters, wow,

596
00:51:02.955 --> 00:51:06.291
it's, um...

597
00:51:06.324 --> 00:51:09.494
So now what, huh?

598
00:51:09.528 --> 00:51:11.698
Jesus.

599
00:51:11.731 --> 00:51:14.000
It's been, uh,

600
00:51:14.033 --> 00:51:16.368
weeks since the disastrous

601
00:51:16.401 --> 00:51:19.237
Knockers program,

602
00:51:19.271 --> 00:51:21.606
and we are definitely worse off
than when we started.

603
00:51:21.641 --> 00:51:26.478
You know, I wish I could say
that this is all weird,

604
00:51:26.511 --> 00:51:29.682
but the government failures
like this are far from weird,

605
00:51:29.716 --> 00:51:31.583
and you know exactly
what I'm talkin' about.

606
00:51:31.616 --> 00:51:33.920
It's all part of that
Big Brother bullshit

607
00:51:33.953 --> 00:51:35.554
that we've all eaten up since

608
00:51:35.587 --> 00:51:36.889
the start of
modern civilization.

609
00:51:36.923 --> 00:51:39.357
But you know
what's different, folks,

610
00:51:39.391 --> 00:51:41.526
now is that we have birds

611
00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:44.764
and fuckin' satellites
falling from the sky,

612
00:51:44.797 --> 00:51:47.299
crazy weather shifts
that make zero sense,

613
00:51:47.332 --> 00:51:48.266
and not to mention

614
00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:52.772
half of the world's
population is missing.

615
00:51:52.805 --> 00:51:54.539
Open your eyes!

616
00:51:57.877 --> 00:51:59.879
You know what, though,
I'll tell ya nature must be

617
00:51:59.912 --> 00:52:01.814
loving less humans right now,

618
00:52:01.848 --> 00:52:03.448
but I sure am

619
00:52:03.482 --> 00:52:06.686
pretty weirded out.

620
00:52:06.719 --> 00:52:11.523
And is this even
reality right now? Fuck!

621
00:52:11.556 --> 00:52:13.926
Fuck if I know.

622
00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:15.928
But...

623
00:52:15.962 --> 00:52:18.831
what Midnight does know, folks,

624
00:52:18.865 --> 00:52:21.500
is that it's getting worse,

625
00:52:21.533 --> 00:52:25.437
and we deserve answers.

626
00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:29.474
So, stay tuned for
my next guest tomorrow,

627
00:52:29.508 --> 00:52:33.780
who has some interesting
answers for us.

628
00:52:33.813 --> 00:52:37.717
This is Martin Midnight.

629
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:39.584
Stay weird.

630
00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:09.447
...know about you,
but I'm pretty sure that

631
00:53:09.481 --> 00:53:11.818
if I had one of those
things in my backyard,

632
00:53:11.851 --> 00:53:13.052
I'd call someone.

633
00:53:13.085 --> 00:53:15.587
But that's not the best part,
she named it.

634
00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:17.522
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
let's talk about something

635
00:53:17.556 --> 00:53:18.891
very important here.

636
00:53:18.925 --> 00:53:22.128
- What did she call it?
- Ready for the name?

637
00:53:22.161 --> 00:53:23.996
- Ferdinand.
- Whoa, what?

638
00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:26.032
- Ferdinand the door?
- Yeah, that's right.

639
00:53:26.065 --> 00:53:28.500
And on that note, to all
of my listeners out there,

640
00:53:28.533 --> 00:53:30.468
please take heed,
if you see a door,

641
00:53:30.502 --> 00:53:31.971
report it to
the local authorities.

642
00:53:32.004 --> 00:53:34.106
Don't approach it.

643
00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:37.609
And for God's sakes,
don't name them!

644
00:53:37.643 --> 00:53:38.978
Be safe and call for help, okay?

645
00:53:39.011 --> 00:53:41.681
Stay inside,
and in the meantime...

646
00:54:52.985 --> 00:54:55.955
Hi, Jamal Adkins, day four.

647
00:54:55.988 --> 00:54:57.757
Let's proceed.

648
00:55:01.127 --> 00:55:02.494
Hey, buddy.

649
00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:08.134
How are we feeling today?

650
00:55:08.167 --> 00:55:11.671
Tell you what,
I am feeling very good,

651
00:55:11.704 --> 00:55:15.041
and it's because of you.

652
00:55:15.074 --> 00:55:18.576
And I know that it's
gonna be a good day.

653
00:55:18.610 --> 00:55:22.114
And that should make you feel

654
00:55:22.148 --> 00:55:23.883
pretty good.

655
00:55:29.554 --> 00:55:31.623
Hmm.

656
00:55:31.657 --> 00:55:33.960
I see.

657
00:55:33.993 --> 00:55:36.662
Same foul mood as yesterday.

658
00:55:36.696 --> 00:55:40.900
But, we're not gonna
let that stop us

659
00:55:40.933 --> 00:55:43.102
with the work we have to do,

660
00:55:43.135 --> 00:55:47.740
which is plenty.

661
00:55:47.773 --> 00:55:49.909
So we tried that yesterday,
and it didn't work.

662
00:55:49.942 --> 00:55:52.845
So, we need to
try something else.

663
00:55:52.878 --> 00:55:54.747
Well, we did.

664
00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:56.082
We tried that yesterday.

665
00:55:57.883 --> 00:55:59.617
Look, I know you're from

666
00:55:59.652 --> 00:56:01.787
an advanced civilization,
but I was here.

667
00:56:01.821 --> 00:56:06.225
We tried that, and we need
to try something else.

668
00:56:06.258 --> 00:56:10.029
Maybe if we stuck
in more frequencies.

669
00:56:12.131 --> 00:56:14.734
See if we can get anything

670
00:56:14.767 --> 00:56:16.969
besides mud.

671
00:56:17.003 --> 00:56:18.204
Am I coming through?

672
00:56:18.237 --> 00:56:19.972
Hello, hello?

673
00:56:22.607 --> 00:56:25.978
Hello?

674
00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:36.621
Hey.

675
00:56:36.655 --> 00:56:38.858
- Hello, friend.
- Hello?

676
00:56:41.093 --> 00:56:42.862
What about now?

677
00:56:53.105 --> 00:56:54.874
Hello?

678
00:57:19.665 --> 00:57:20.866
Hello?

679
00:57:25.004 --> 00:57:26.172
Hello.

680
00:57:33.679 --> 00:57:37.149
Let's talk.

681
00:57:37.183 --> 00:57:39.985
Whoa.

682
00:57:40.019 --> 00:57:42.188
Holy fucking Christ.

683
00:57:45.825 --> 00:57:48.828
Can...

684
00:57:48.861 --> 00:57:49.929
Can you hear me?

685
00:57:49.962 --> 00:57:53.666
- Can you...
- Yes, Jamal Adkins.

686
00:57:53.699 --> 00:57:55.000
Social security number,

687
00:57:55.034 --> 00:57:57.670
765-56-7682.

688
00:57:57.703 --> 00:58:02.741
Holy fuck, holy, holy fuck!

689
00:58:02.775 --> 00:58:04.043
You can just call me Jamal.

690
00:58:04.076 --> 00:58:08.314
- You can just...
- Hi, Jamal.

691
00:58:08.347 --> 00:58:10.249
Hello.

692
00:58:10.282 --> 00:58:13.252
Friend, Jamal, buddy.

693
00:58:13.285 --> 00:58:15.821
Hey, can I,

694
00:58:15.855 --> 00:58:17.423
can I get you to
talk to the camera?

695
00:58:17.456 --> 00:58:20.359
Can you answer some
questions for the camera?

696
00:58:20.392 --> 00:58:23.162
I... Can you tell

697
00:58:23.195 --> 00:58:26.098
the camera who you are?

698
00:58:26.132 --> 00:58:28.234
I'm your friend.

699
00:58:28.267 --> 00:58:30.069
How are you?

700
00:58:30.102 --> 00:58:32.104
I'm pretty fucking good.

701
00:58:32.138 --> 00:58:36.709
I'm pretty fucking good,
can you, can you tell me

702
00:58:36.742 --> 00:58:39.778
where, where are you from?

703
00:58:39.812 --> 00:58:44.250
We have come upon the planet.

704
00:58:44.283 --> 00:58:48.020
We watch sentient beings.

705
00:58:48.053 --> 00:58:49.455
- You stay alive...
- Jamal?

706
00:58:49.488 --> 00:58:53.726
- ...for now.
- Friend.

707
00:58:53.759 --> 00:58:56.862
Can you tell the camera
what your species is?

708
00:58:56.896 --> 00:58:59.198
We archive.

709
00:58:59.231 --> 00:59:02.468
We will refresh all of you.

710
00:59:02.501 --> 00:59:05.204
We archive Earth.

711
00:59:44.410 --> 00:59:46.378
- Cathy.
- Jamal.

712
00:59:46.412 --> 00:59:48.013
Please, come here.

713
00:59:53.219 --> 00:59:55.988
- Um, this is Leo.
- 'Sup, I'm Leo.

714
00:59:56.021 --> 00:59:57.089
I'm her boyfriend.

715
00:59:57.122 --> 00:59:59.391
Oh.

716
00:59:59.425 --> 01:00:01.794
Jamal.

717
01:00:01.827 --> 01:00:03.395
Sorry.

718
01:00:03.429 --> 01:00:04.530
Those organic?

719
01:00:04.563 --> 01:00:07.366
No.

720
01:00:13.205 --> 01:00:14.940
Are you ready?

721
01:00:14.974 --> 01:00:17.776
- Yes, ready.
- Mm-hm.

722
01:00:23.449 --> 01:00:26.285
He chews loudly
when he's nervous.

723
01:00:26.318 --> 01:00:28.254
I'm not nervous.

724
01:00:28.287 --> 01:00:29.521
I, you know,

725
01:00:29.555 --> 01:00:31.523
we're lucky to be in one piece

726
01:00:31.557 --> 01:00:34.326
with those doors
out there killing people.

727
01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:36.895
I'm pretty sure they're here for
more than just killing people.

728
01:00:39.498 --> 01:00:44.570
Um, did you go crazy before
they let you go, or after?

729
01:00:44.603 --> 01:00:46.171
Jesus, Leo.

730
01:00:46.205 --> 01:00:47.306
No offense.

731
01:00:47.339 --> 01:00:51.343
He was fired for his brilliant,
yet controversial ideas.

732
01:00:51.377 --> 01:00:52.978
I'm sorry.

733
01:00:53.012 --> 01:00:55.014
What did you wanna
tell us, Jamal?

734
01:00:55.047 --> 01:00:59.451
Literally,
on the edge of my seat.

735
01:00:59.485 --> 01:01:02.888
Cathy, I asked you to come here
because you're my friend,

736
01:01:02.921 --> 01:01:06.892
and I know that we haven't
seen each other much lately,

737
01:01:06.925 --> 01:01:11.397
but you're still
my most trusted companion

738
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:13.932
in the scientific community.

739
01:01:13.966 --> 01:01:18.103
Um, Leo, you're here

740
01:01:18.137 --> 01:01:19.438
'cause Cathy brought you.

741
01:01:19.471 --> 01:01:23.108
But if Cathy trusts you,
then I trust you.

742
01:01:23.142 --> 01:01:25.844
Oh, that's great, yeah,
that's great.

743
01:01:25.878 --> 01:01:27.212
Either you end my anticipation,

744
01:01:27.246 --> 01:01:30.215
or I'm gonna end
both of your lives.

745
01:01:30.249 --> 01:01:32.117
I have a door.

746
01:01:32.151 --> 01:01:33.319
That's my announcement,

747
01:01:33.352 --> 01:01:35.854
which you both

748
01:01:35.888 --> 01:01:36.989
kind of ruined.

749
01:01:37.022 --> 01:01:40.392
But I have a door.

750
01:01:40.426 --> 01:01:42.094
Bullshit!

751
01:01:42.127 --> 01:01:44.596
No, if you had a door,

752
01:01:44.631 --> 01:01:47.032
there would be, like,
a million of those Knockers here

753
01:01:47.066 --> 01:01:49.468
- sterilizing this entire place.
- Sure, if they knew,

754
01:01:49.501 --> 01:01:52.971
they'd be here,
but I didn't report it.

755
01:01:55.274 --> 01:01:56.909
Can we see it?

756
01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:11.190
Jamal's been talking about
an alien invasion for years.

757
01:02:11.223 --> 01:02:13.926
Yeah, that makes sense.

758
01:02:13.959 --> 01:02:15.928
So tell us more about this door.

759
01:02:15.961 --> 01:02:17.329
Well, the thing is,

760
01:02:17.363 --> 01:02:19.565
I found a way to
communicate with this one.

761
01:02:19.598 --> 01:02:20.700
Oh, you can communicate with it,

762
01:02:20.734 --> 01:02:23.469
but the government can't even
seem to make contact?

763
01:02:23.502 --> 01:02:25.604
I'm better than the government.

764
01:02:25.638 --> 01:02:26.939
Uh, no offense,

765
01:02:26.972 --> 01:02:28.974
but how are you better than

766
01:02:29.007 --> 01:02:30.509
billions of dollars
of technology

767
01:02:30.542 --> 01:02:32.978
and scientific research?

768
01:02:33.011 --> 01:02:34.513
No offense.

769
01:02:34.546 --> 01:02:36.115
Just trust me.

770
01:02:46.058 --> 01:02:48.293
Yeah, so I,

771
01:02:48.327 --> 01:02:49.228
I could hear it.

772
01:02:49.261 --> 01:02:52.164
It was talking to me,
like, in my head.

773
01:02:52.197 --> 01:02:55.167
Wait, you hear voices?

774
01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:57.970
It's just right up here
around the bend.

775
01:02:58.003 --> 01:03:00.272
Let me just get this set up.

776
01:03:15.487 --> 01:03:17.489
Hey, this is Jamal.

777
01:03:17.523 --> 01:03:19.091
Are you there, friend?

778
01:03:27.599 --> 01:03:30.068
Careful, these are
really dangerous.

779
01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:38.210
Hi, Jamal, buddy.

780
01:03:43.048 --> 01:03:44.651
Yeah!

781
01:03:44.684 --> 01:03:47.252
Yeah, this is your buddy, Jamal.

782
01:03:47.286 --> 01:03:49.121
I'm here with
my friend, Cathy,

783
01:03:49.154 --> 01:03:52.191
I want you to meet
friend Cathy.

784
01:03:52.224 --> 01:03:56.462
And, and this is Leo.

785
01:03:56.495 --> 01:04:00.065
What's up, Jamal, buddies?

786
01:04:05.304 --> 01:04:08.173
- Can I say something to it?
- Of course.

787
01:04:15.113 --> 01:04:18.116
Hi, I'm Cathy.

788
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:21.654
Hello, Cathy, friend.

789
01:04:31.631 --> 01:04:33.733
Oh, my God!

790
01:04:38.136 --> 01:04:40.138
What do we call it?

791
01:04:40.172 --> 01:04:42.341
I don't know,
I never got its name.

792
01:04:42.374 --> 01:04:44.811
I've just been calling it
friend and buddy.

793
01:04:44.844 --> 01:04:47.079
My name is

794
01:04:51.818 --> 01:04:55.320
Um, do you have a nickname?

795
01:04:55.354 --> 01:04:57.724
Something we can call you?

796
01:04:57.757 --> 01:05:00.392
Lamaj.

797
01:05:00.425 --> 01:05:05.765
- Lamaj.
- Lamaj.

798
01:05:05.798 --> 01:05:08.500
Lamaj is...

799
01:05:08.534 --> 01:05:10.335
Lamaj, Lamaj is

800
01:05:10.369 --> 01:05:12.805
- Jamal backwards.
- Jamal.

801
01:05:15.374 --> 01:05:16.508
Friend.

802
01:05:19.779 --> 01:05:21.613
Told me yesterday that

803
01:05:21.648 --> 01:05:22.749
they're here studying us,

804
01:05:22.782 --> 01:05:26.251
that the doors are
collecting data.

805
01:05:30.222 --> 01:05:34.593
Maybe this one's
studying friendship.

806
01:05:41.166 --> 01:05:44.136
Lamaj, why are you here?

807
01:05:44.169 --> 01:05:47.139
We come to archive.

808
01:05:47.172 --> 01:05:48.574
Archive what?

809
01:05:51.143 --> 01:05:52.578
Archive what?

810
01:05:54.179 --> 01:05:55.581
Humanity.

811
01:06:13.198 --> 01:06:15.868
This is huge.

812
01:06:15.902 --> 01:06:19.605
This could be it for us.

813
01:06:19.639 --> 01:06:22.541
And it could put us on the map.

814
01:06:22.574 --> 01:06:25.344
Well, how do you mean,
which map?

815
01:06:25.377 --> 01:06:27.346
Don't you see?

816
01:06:27.379 --> 01:06:29.381
We can learn the secrets
of the universe

817
01:06:29.414 --> 01:06:32.785
through what Lamaj knows.

818
01:06:32.819 --> 01:06:36.789
We can be cosmic explorers
like we always talked about.

819
01:06:41.493 --> 01:06:42.361
Life can't just be teaching

820
01:06:42.394 --> 01:06:44.296
a bunch of low-level
astronomy classes

821
01:06:44.329 --> 01:06:47.299
to kids who don't give a shit.

822
01:06:47.332 --> 01:06:49.736
Nah, this is huge.

823
01:06:51.804 --> 01:06:53.906
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

824
01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:57.609
I just, I think
we should go slow.

825
01:06:57.644 --> 01:06:59.277
Come on, Jamal.

826
01:06:59.311 --> 01:07:01.848
Isn't this why you
called me here, for this?

827
01:07:09.421 --> 01:07:10.723
Okay.

828
01:07:12.524 --> 01:07:14.192
We can go slow.

829
01:07:16.628 --> 01:07:19.766
We'll report it
when we're ready.

830
01:07:19.799 --> 01:07:20.900
When, when we're ready, uh,

831
01:07:20.933 --> 01:07:24.937
babe, can... babe, can you not
go any closer to that...

832
01:07:24.971 --> 01:07:27.774
Those doors are murdering
people all over the world!

833
01:07:27.807 --> 01:07:29.842
All the doors are different,
this door hasn't killed anybody.

834
01:07:29.876 --> 01:07:31.343
It's just here
to communicate with us.

835
01:07:31.376 --> 01:07:33.311
Oh, okay, yeah, Jamal.

836
01:07:33.345 --> 01:07:35.848
I know that you think
you and the door are homies,

837
01:07:35.882 --> 01:07:38.617
all right, but you
have no fucking clue

838
01:07:38.651 --> 01:07:39.652
what this thing

839
01:07:39.686 --> 01:07:41.253
could actually be plotting

840
01:07:41.286 --> 01:07:43.656
with the rest
of the doors, okay?

841
01:07:43.690 --> 01:07:46.258
How do you know that we're
not getting poisoned right now

842
01:07:46.291 --> 01:07:49.294
by some nuclear radiation
from this fucking thing?

843
01:07:49.327 --> 01:07:54.466
May be, but we can't bury
any attempt with assumptions.

844
01:07:59.639 --> 01:08:01.573
You have all
the secrets, don't you?

845
01:08:01.606 --> 01:08:02.809
Okay, look,

846
01:08:02.842 --> 01:08:04.609
do you guys at least understand

847
01:08:04.644 --> 01:08:06.679
how many people are
in danger right now?

848
01:08:06.713 --> 01:08:08.547
Because this thing

849
01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:10.382
hasn't been quarantined yet?

850
01:08:10.415 --> 01:08:11.416
Seriously, like, what if,

851
01:08:11.450 --> 01:08:13.786
- if it liquefies...
- Step away from the door, ma'am!

852
01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:15.922
Oh, Christ.

853
01:08:15.955 --> 01:08:17.690
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to
step away from the the door.

854
01:08:17.724 --> 01:08:19.025
Oh, for crying out fucking loud.

855
01:08:19.058 --> 01:08:20.459
Step away from the door!

856
01:08:20.492 --> 01:08:22.795
Come over here, get away.

857
01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:23.996
Come on, babe, come on.

858
01:08:24.030 --> 01:08:27.299
- Holy shit!
- Yeah.

859
01:08:27.332 --> 01:08:28.835
Leo, this thing's
frickin' huge!

860
01:08:28.868 --> 01:08:30.737
Leo, did you call the cops?

861
01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:34.272
Okay, Ricky is a friend.

862
01:08:34.306 --> 01:08:36.308
Ma'am, ma'am, stop right there.

863
01:08:36.341 --> 01:08:37.977
- Just stop, okay?
- What she doin'?

864
01:08:38.010 --> 01:08:39.846
She paces when she's nervous.

865
01:08:39.879 --> 01:08:40.980
Ma'am, stop right there!

866
01:08:41.013 --> 01:08:42.514
Stop right there!

867
01:08:42.547 --> 01:08:44.717
Stop, just you're
making the sheriff nervous...

868
01:08:44.751 --> 01:08:46.418
Ma'am, stop right now!

869
01:08:46.451 --> 01:08:48.420
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Ricky, Ricky.
- You guys are all in violation

870
01:08:48.453 --> 01:08:51.456
of ordinance 256,
unlawful engagement with a door.

871
01:08:51.490 --> 01:08:52.859
- Whose property is this?
- It's mine.

872
01:08:52.892 --> 01:08:54.794
Who are you, step away
from that table, sir!

873
01:08:54.827 --> 01:08:56.461
Sir, away from the table!

874
01:08:56.495 --> 01:08:58.296
On your knees, on your knees!

875
01:08:58.330 --> 01:09:00.599
- Can you just chill with that...
- What is your name? Shut up!

876
01:09:00.633 --> 01:09:02.034
What is your name, sir?

877
01:09:02.068 --> 01:09:05.470
Jamal Adkins, buddy.

878
01:09:07.339 --> 01:09:09.642
The fuckin' door just talk?

879
01:09:09.675 --> 01:09:11.744
- Absolutely not.
- Yes.

880
01:09:11.778 --> 01:09:14.412
This is unit 421,
I'm gonna need backup.

881
01:09:14.446 --> 01:09:15.580
You stay right there, sir.

882
01:09:15.614 --> 01:09:17.750
- I'm not moving.
- Shut up, shut up!

883
01:09:17.784 --> 01:09:20.787
- Can you just lower the gun?
- Quit pacin'!

884
01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:21.988
You stay put!

885
01:09:22.021 --> 01:09:23.790
- Lamaj.
- Sir, shut up!

886
01:09:23.823 --> 01:09:24.657
Can you just put the gun down?

887
01:09:24.690 --> 01:09:26.993
This is 421, I need backup stat,
please.

888
01:09:27.026 --> 01:09:28.527
Lamaj, a little help please?

889
01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:29.729
Who you talkin' to?

890
01:09:29.762 --> 01:09:32.765
This is 421,
I need backup right now!

891
01:09:32.799 --> 01:09:35.367
- Shut up, you shut up!
- Just calm down.

892
01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:38.037
I repeat, 421, I need backup.

893
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:38.704
Oh, my God, what?

894
01:09:38.738 --> 01:09:42.541
What the fuck are you doing?

895
01:09:42.574 --> 01:09:44.010
Holy shit!

896
01:09:49.048 --> 01:09:50.783
Fuck.

897
01:09:53.786 --> 01:09:54.921
You!

898
01:10:32.658 --> 01:10:34.626
Hi, friend.

899
01:10:37.697 --> 01:10:41.634
It's time to refresh.

900
01:11:37.522 --> 01:11:38.891
Holy shit, joining
the conversation

901
01:11:38.925 --> 01:11:40.026
this is a big one, guys.

902
01:11:40.059 --> 01:11:42.194
All the way from sunny Seattle

903
01:11:42.228 --> 01:11:44.864
is Parallel Worlds theorist...

904
01:11:44.897 --> 01:11:46.531
that's one of the show's
favorite magazines,

905
01:11:46.564 --> 01:11:49.802
by the way... Dr. Alan Price.

906
01:11:49.835 --> 01:11:52.672
- So good to have you.
- Thank you.

907
01:11:52.705 --> 01:11:55.041
Yeah, so, uh, Dr. Price,
I'm gonna just jump right in.

908
01:11:55.074 --> 01:11:59.745
These doors...
you know, what are these things?

909
01:11:59.779 --> 01:12:02.480
What do they want,
and what's next?

910
01:12:02.514 --> 01:12:05.583
What do... Talk to me, Alan.

911
01:12:05.617 --> 01:12:07.987
Well, it's easy to say that
the arrival of the doors

912
01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:10.522
has changed everything.

913
01:12:10.555 --> 01:12:11.724
Whether that's missing people,

914
01:12:11.757 --> 01:12:16.228
or humans returning
cosmically evolved.

915
01:12:16.262 --> 01:12:18.530
And what I can
tell you for sure is

916
01:12:18.563 --> 01:12:21.767
it will continue.

917
01:12:21.801 --> 01:12:23.269
Dr. Price, you're, um,

918
01:12:23.302 --> 01:12:26.238
you've been
around the doors, right?

919
01:12:26.272 --> 01:12:28.641
Yes, you can say that.

920
01:12:28.674 --> 01:12:31.543
So, talk to me,
what do they want?

921
01:12:31.576 --> 01:12:33.245
You know, what are they?

922
01:12:33.279 --> 01:12:35.815
They are our
cosmic consciousness.

923
01:12:38.918 --> 01:12:40.720
Fuck.

924
01:12:40.753 --> 01:12:44.256
Well, that certainly
passes my weird test, what...

925
01:12:44.290 --> 01:12:46.959
Can you elaborate a little bit?

926
01:12:46.993 --> 01:12:50.830
They are a kind of...

927
01:12:50.863 --> 01:12:56.068
arbiter for existence.

928
01:12:56.102 --> 01:12:58.204
Arbiter?

929
01:12:58.237 --> 01:12:59.972
You mean, like a judge?

930
01:13:00.006 --> 01:13:02.208
No, not at all.

931
01:13:02.241 --> 01:13:04.210
Their intelligence allows them

932
01:13:04.243 --> 01:13:08.214
to operate on a complex,
multidimensional reality.

933
01:13:08.247 --> 01:13:11.050
They are everything all at once.

934
01:13:11.083 --> 01:13:13.819
We are them, they are us.

935
01:13:13.853 --> 01:13:15.955
You can even consider them

936
01:13:15.988 --> 01:13:18.623
God, but more.

937
01:13:21.027 --> 01:13:23.628
Well, how 'bout that, folks?

938
01:13:23.662 --> 01:13:26.932
Doors may be God.

939
01:13:26.966 --> 01:13:28.968
Dr. Price,

940
01:13:29.001 --> 01:13:32.338
so should we be stockin' up
on toilet paper?

941
01:13:32.371 --> 01:13:34.340
Should we be dustin' off
our shotguns?

942
01:13:34.373 --> 01:13:36.675
What do you think?

943
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:38.144
I assure you,

944
01:13:38.177 --> 01:13:41.313
there is nothing
you can do to stop them.

945
01:13:41.347 --> 01:13:43.115
Nor should you.

946
01:13:43.149 --> 01:13:47.319
You see, the doors decide
and control everything.

947
01:13:47.353 --> 01:13:50.289
Their process is quite perfect.

948
01:13:53.359 --> 01:13:54.960
Uh...

949
01:13:56.996 --> 01:14:00.733
Dr. Price, you're very
fuckin' weird.

950
01:14:00.766 --> 01:14:03.636
And I love weird,

951
01:14:03.669 --> 01:14:06.839
but you're saying
there's nothing we can do?

952
01:14:06.872 --> 01:14:09.708
Yes, there is.

953
01:14:09.742 --> 01:14:10.943
Great, like what?

954
01:14:10.976 --> 01:14:13.345
What do we do?

955
01:14:13.379 --> 01:14:17.016
Wait to be refreshed.

956
01:14:17.049 --> 01:14:18.317
Refreshed?

957
01:14:20.686 --> 01:14:21.921
Like, what are we,

958
01:14:21.954 --> 01:14:25.024
some kinda web browser?

959
01:14:29.095 --> 01:14:31.764
Uh, Dr. Price, you're...

960
01:14:31.797 --> 01:14:34.366
You okay there? Your signal
cut out for a second.

961
01:14:37.937 --> 01:14:39.238
Accept it.

962
01:14:41.907 --> 01:14:43.409
Accept what?

963
01:14:43.442 --> 01:14:45.077
Once the doors

964
01:14:45.111 --> 01:14:47.780
tether into all of
mankind's consciousness,

965
01:14:47.813 --> 01:14:51.917
the shift into the next
created reality will ensue.

966
01:14:51.951 --> 01:14:55.387
We are all awakening.

967
01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:10.669
Yeah, uh...

968
01:15:10.703 --> 01:15:14.240
Dr. Price, is it true that

969
01:15:14.273 --> 01:15:15.808
the people who
come out of the doors

970
01:15:15.841 --> 01:15:17.042
are altered in some way?

971
01:15:17.076 --> 01:15:19.411
Can you tell us
a little more about that?

972
01:15:22.982 --> 01:15:26.018
You know the answer.

973
01:15:26.051 --> 01:15:27.920
I really don't.

974
01:15:27.953 --> 01:15:28.988
You tell me.

975
01:15:29.021 --> 01:15:31.457
This is all a test.

976
01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:34.293
A way for the doors
to collect information

977
01:15:34.326 --> 01:15:36.362
in order for them to decide

978
01:15:36.395 --> 01:15:40.366
what our next re-interpreted
reality will be.

979
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:48.407
Dr. Price, have you been
in contact with the doors?

980
01:15:52.111 --> 01:15:54.079
Accept it, Paul.

981
01:15:56.849 --> 01:15:58.350
How do you know my name?

982
01:16:01.921 --> 01:16:05.724
- What the fuck is this?
- What the fuck is this?

983
01:16:05.758 --> 01:16:07.259
Your memories,

984
01:16:07.293 --> 01:16:11.163
fears, doubts, desires,

985
01:16:11.197 --> 01:16:14.066
they all will be absorbed...

986
01:16:14.099 --> 01:16:16.869
refreshed.

987
01:16:16.902 --> 01:16:19.004
Do not be afraid.

988
01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:26.178
- Are the doors telling you this?
- Are the doors telling you this?

989
01:16:26.212 --> 01:16:28.047
No, Paul.

990
01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:31.217
I do not speak to the doors.

991
01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:33.385
I feel them.

992
01:16:33.419 --> 01:16:36.855
Something the human
species has forgot,

993
01:16:36.889 --> 01:16:39.959
feeling.

994
01:16:39.992 --> 01:16:43.796
You, too, have forgotten, Paul.

995
01:16:43.829 --> 01:16:46.498
In your search to exploit
the events in this world

996
01:16:46.532 --> 01:16:48.934
so you can feel

997
01:16:48.968 --> 01:16:50.436
important,

998
01:16:50.469 --> 01:16:52.805
and in control.

999
01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:56.442
Does it hurt,

1000
01:16:56.475 --> 01:17:00.346
you hiding behind your image?

1001
01:17:00.379 --> 01:17:03.949
Does it hurt, you using my

1002
01:17:03.983 --> 01:17:05.251
strange behavior

1003
01:17:05.284 --> 01:17:08.420
as entertainment?

1004
01:17:08.454 --> 01:17:10.556
Does it hurt,

1005
01:17:10.589 --> 01:17:15.094
you knowing that you
do not have control right now?

1006
01:17:18.397 --> 01:17:22.134
The process has started.

1007
01:17:22.167 --> 01:17:23.502
Do you feel it?

1008
01:17:26.872 --> 01:17:28.540
Accept it!

1009
01:17:32.978 --> 01:17:34.413
It's already happening.

1010
01:17:44.623 --> 01:17:47.526
Embrace your new reality.

1011
01:18:07.112 --> 01:18:10.949
That's right, accept it.

1012
01:18:10.983 --> 01:18:15.187
Embrace it,
embrace your new reality.

1013
01:18:51.256 --> 01:18:53.225
Welcome.
