[electronic beeping]

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:45.962
-Hi, honey.
-Hi, Mom.

5
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.552
-You feeling any better?
-A little bit.

6
00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:56.097
-Guess what?
-What?

7
00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:57.640
Your grandfather's here.

8
00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:00.727
Mom, can't you tell him I'm sick?

9
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.564
You're sick?
That's why he's here.

10
00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:05.899
He'll pinch my cheek.

11
00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:07.525
I hate that.

12
00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:08.943
Maybe he won't.

13
00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:13.865
Hey, how is the sickie? Huh?

14
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:19.746
I think I'll leave you two pals alone.

15
00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.873
I brought you a special present.

16
00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:24.125
-What is it?
-Open it up.

17
00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:31.549
-A book?
-That's right.

18
00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:34.886
When I was your age,
television was called books.

19
00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:37.013
And this is a special book.

20
00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:40.558
It was the book my father
used to read to me when I was sick,

21
00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:43.269
and I used to read it
to your father.

22
00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:45.230
And today,
I'm gonna read it to you.

23
00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.983
-Has it got any sports in it?
-Are you kidding?

24
00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:52.946
Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge,

25
00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:56.533
giants, monsters, chases, escapes,

26
00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:59.494
true love, miracles.

27
00:01:59.577 --> 00:02:03.081
Doesn't sound too bad.
I'll try and stay awake.

28
00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:06.543
Well, thank you very much.
Very nice of you.

29
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.004
Your vote of confidence
is overwhelming.

30
00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:11.714
All right.

Chapter one.

34
00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:25.520
Buttercup was raised on a small farm
in the country of Florin.

35
00:02:25.603 --> 00:02:28.356
Her favorite pastimes
were riding her horse

36
00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.860
and tormenting the farm boy
that worked there.

37
00:02:31.943 --> 00:02:35.780
His name was Westley,
but she never called him that."

38
00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:37.782
Isn't that
a wonderful beginning?

39
00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:41.369
[grandson]
Yeah, it's really good.

[grandfather] "Nothing gave Buttercup
as much pleasure

41
00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:45.874
as ordering Westley around."

00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:49.085
Farm boy,
polish my horse's saddle.

43
00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:52.046
I want to see my face
shining in it by morning.

44
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.798
As you wish.

45
00:02:57.093 --> 00:03:00.138
[grandfather] "'As you wish'
was all he ever said to her."

46
00:03:03.057 --> 00:03:05.560
Farm boy, fill these with water.

47
00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:09.147
Please?

48
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.648
As you wish.

49
00:03:15.778 --> 00:03:17.906
[grandfather] "That day,
she was amazed to discover

50
00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.949
that when he was saying,
'As you wish,'

51
00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.868
what he meant was,
'I love you.'

52
00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:29.334
And even more amazing was the day
she realized she truly loved him back."

53
00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:32.420
Farm boy...

54
00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:39.802
fetch me that pitcher.

55
00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:57.403
As you wish.

56
00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:09.165
[grandson] Hold it. Hold it.

57
00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.085
What is this?
Are you trying to trick me?

58
00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:14.087
Where's the sports?

59
00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:16.965
Is this a kissing book?

60
00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:18.758
Wait. Just wait.

61
00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:20.677
When does it get good?

62
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.887
Keep your shirt on.
Let me read.

63
00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:26.474
"Westley had no money
for marriage,

64
00:04:26.557 --> 00:04:28.851
so he packed his few belongings
and left the farm

65
00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.853
to seek his fortune
across the sea.

66
00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:34.274
It was a very emotional time
for Buttercup."

67
00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:36.109
[grandson]
I don't believe this.

68
00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:40.071
I fear I'll never
see you again.

69
00:04:40.154 --> 00:04:42.031
Of course you will.

70
00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:45.368
But what if something
happens to you?

71
00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:49.664
Hear this now.

72
00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.793
I will always come for you.

73
00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:57.088
But how can you be sure?

74
00:04:58.131 --> 00:04:59.424
This is true love.

75
00:05:01.592 --> 00:05:03.344
Do you think this happens
every day?

[grandfather] "Westley
didn't reach his destination.

When Buttercup got the news
that Westley was murdered..."

80
00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:28.703

Murdered by pirates is good.

"...she went into her room
and shut the door.

82
00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:33.875
And for days,
she neither slept nor ate."

83
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:36.711
I will never love again.

a commoner like yourselves.

93
00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:21.130
you will not find her common

now.

95
00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.425
Would you like to meet her?

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:26.511
[all] Yes!

Although the law of the land
gave Humperdinck the right

to choose his bride,

104
00:07:01.337 --> 00:07:03.589

107
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.685

was in her daily ride."

-[man] A word, my lady?

We are but poor,
lost circus performers.

110
00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:37.206
Is there a village nearby?

111
00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:40.793
There is nothing nearby,
not for miles.

112
00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:43.838
Then there will be no one
to hear you scream.

113
00:07:45.673 --> 00:07:46.549
[gasps]

114
00:07:51.929 --> 00:07:53.431
What is that you're ripping?

115
00:07:53.514 --> 00:07:56.017
It is fabric from the uniform
of an army officer of Guilder.

116
00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:57.935
Who is Guilder?

117
00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:01.606
The country across the sea.
The sworn enemy of Florin.

118
00:08:01.689 --> 00:08:02.732
Go!

119
00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:05.401
Once the horse
reaches the castle,

120
00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.195
the fabric will make
the prince suspect

121
00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:09.989
the Guilderians
have abducted his love.

122
00:08:10.072 --> 00:08:12.533
When he finds her body dead
on the Guilder frontier,

123
00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:14.952
his suspicions will be
totally confirmed.

124
00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:17.538
You never said anything
about killing anyone.

125
00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:20.208
I've hired you
to help me start a war.

126
00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:22.335
It's a prestigious
line of work

127
00:08:22.418 --> 00:08:24.462
with a long
and glorious tradition.

128
00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:28.299
I just don't think it's right
killing an innocent girl.

129
00:08:28.382 --> 00:08:30.593
Am I going mad

130
00:08:30.676 --> 00:08:33.554
or did the word "think"
escape your lips?

131
00:08:33.638 --> 00:08:37.391
You were not hired for your brains,
you hippopotamic landmass!

132
00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:39.143
I agree with Fezzik.

133
00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:42.021
Oh! The sot has spoken.

134
00:08:42.104 --> 00:08:44.315
What happens to her is not
truly your concern.

135
00:08:44.398 --> 00:08:47.860
I will kill her! And remember this.
Never forget this!

136
00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:49.278
When I found you,

137
00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:52.990
you were so slobbering drunk
you couldn't buy brandy!

138
00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:56.994
And you!
Friendless. Brainless.

139
00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:59.247
Helpless! Hopeless!

140
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.542
Do you want me to send you back
to where you were?

141
00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:05.545
Unemployed? In Greenland?

142
00:09:18.474 --> 00:09:20.184
That Vizzini,

143
00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:23.187
he can fuss.

144
00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:25.231
Fuss. Fuss.

145
00:09:25.314 --> 00:09:28.442
I think he like to scream at us.

146
00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:31.612
Probably he means no harm.

147
00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:36.784
He's really very short on charm.

148
00:09:36.867 --> 00:09:39.787
[sighs] You have
a great gift for rhyme.

149
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.248
Yes. Yes. Some other time.

150
00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:43.916
[Vizzini] Enough of that!

151
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.044
[Inigo] Fezzik,
are there rocks ahead?

152
00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:49.297
[Fezzik] If there are,
we'll all be dead.

153
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.799
[Vizzini] No more rhymes now,
I mean it!

154
00:09:51.882 --> 00:09:54.719
-[Fezzik] Anybody want a peanut?
-[Vizzini grunting]

155
00:10:03.644 --> 00:10:04.937
We'll reach the cliffs
by dawn.

156
00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:08.399
Why are you doing that?

157
00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:10.985
Are you sure
nobody's follow us?

158
00:10:11.068 --> 00:10:13.446
That would be inconceivable.

159
00:10:13.529 --> 00:10:16.949
Despite what you think,
you will be caught.

160
00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:20.077
And when you are,
the Prince will see you all hanged.

161
00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:22.872
Of all the necks
on this boat, Highness,

162
00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:25.458
the one you should be
worrying about is your own.

163
00:10:30.504 --> 00:10:33.841
Stop doing that!
We can all relax. It's almost over.

164
00:10:33.924 --> 00:10:35.926
You are sure
nobody's follow us?

165
00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:36.886
[Vizzini] As I told you,

166
00:10:36.969 --> 00:10:41.390
it would be absolutely, totally
and in all other ways inconceivable.

167
00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:43.392
No one in Guilder knows
what we've done

168
00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:46.854
and no one in Florin
could have gotten here so fast.

169
00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:51.442
Out of curiosity,
why do you ask?

170
00:10:51.525 --> 00:10:54.487
No reason. Suddenly,
I just happen to look behind us

171
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:55.738
and something is there.

172
00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:56.781
What?

173
00:11:04.872 --> 00:11:08.542
Probably some local fisherman
out for a pleasure cruise at night

174
00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:11.170
through eel-infested waters.

175
00:11:11.253 --> 00:11:12.588
[water splashes]

176
00:11:12.671 --> 00:11:15.674
What? Go in! Get after her!

177
00:11:15.758 --> 00:11:17.426
I don't swim.

178
00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.261
I only dog paddle.

179
00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:20.179
[grunts]

180
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.807
Veer left!

181
00:11:25.976 --> 00:11:27.978
Left! Left!

182
00:11:32.858 --> 00:11:35.736
[shrieking]

183
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.656
[Vizzini] Do you know what
that sound is, Highness?

184
00:11:38.739 --> 00:11:41.325
Those are
the shrieking eels!

185
00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:43.869
If you don't believe me,
just wait.

186
00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:46.330
They always grow louder

187
00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:49.625
when they're about
to feed on human flesh!

188
00:11:49.708 --> 00:11:50.793
[gasps]

189
00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:54.088
If you swim back now,

190
00:11:54.171 --> 00:11:57.508
I promise no harm
will come to you.

191
00:11:57.591 --> 00:12:00.719
I doubt you'll get such an offer
from the eels.

192
00:12:00.803 --> 00:12:01.804
[shrieking]

193
00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:09.687
[screaming]

194
00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:12.898
She doesn't get eaten
by the eels at this time.

195
00:12:13.941 --> 00:12:14.942
What?

196
00:12:15.025 --> 00:12:16.277
The eel doesn't get her.

197
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.155
I'm explaining to you
because you look nervous.

198
00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:21.907
I wasn't nervous.

199
00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:27.913
Maybe I was a little bit concerned,
but that's not the same thing.

200
00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:30.374
Because we can stop now
if you want.

201
00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:34.086
No, you could read
a little bit more if you want.

202
00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:38.591
"Do you know what
that sound is, Highness?

203
00:12:38.674 --> 00:12:40.968
Those are the shrieking eels."

204
00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:43.471
We're past that, Grandpa.
You read it already.

205
00:12:43.554 --> 00:12:45.890
Oh. Oh, my goodness.

206
00:12:45.973 --> 00:12:48.601
I did. I'm sorry.
I beg your pardon.

207
00:12:49.059 --> 00:12:51.687
All right. All right.
Let's see, she was in the water.

208
00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:53.564
The eel was coming after her.

209
00:12:53.647 --> 00:12:56.984
She was frightened.
The eel started to charge her, and then...

210
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.198
Put her down.
Just put her down.

211
00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:08.454
I think he's getting closer.

212
00:13:08.537 --> 00:13:11.540
He's no concern of ours.
Sail on!

213
00:13:12.249 --> 00:13:14.335
I suppose you think
you're brave, don't you?

214
00:13:15.169 --> 00:13:16.837
Only compared to some.

215
00:13:23.385 --> 00:13:25.429
[Inigo] Look!
He's right on top of us!

216
00:13:26.388 --> 00:13:28.557
I wonder if he is using
the same wind we are using.

217
00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:32.102
Whoever he is,
he's too late. See?

218
00:13:34.688 --> 00:13:36.649
The Cliffs of Insanity!

219
00:13:36.732 --> 00:13:40.611
Hurry up! Move the thing!

220
00:13:40.694 --> 00:13:43.072
And that other thing!

221
00:13:44.865 --> 00:13:45.908
Move it!

222
00:13:50.996 --> 00:13:54.124
We're safe. Only Fezzik
is strong enough to go up our way.

223
00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:57.044
He'll have to sail around for hours
till he finds a harbor.

224
00:14:13.435 --> 00:14:14.937
[suspenseful music playing]

225
00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:27.658
[birds cawing]

226
00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:46.844
He's climbing the rope
and he's gaining on us.

227
00:14:46.927 --> 00:14:48.470
Inconceivable.

228
00:14:51.015 --> 00:14:52.182
Faster!

229
00:14:52.266 --> 00:14:54.143
[Fezzik] I thought
I was going faster.

230
00:14:54.226 --> 00:14:56.562
You were supposed
to be this colossus.

231
00:14:56.645 --> 00:15:00.149
You were this great legendary thing.
And yet, he gains!

232
00:15:00.232 --> 00:15:03.903
Well, I'm carrying three people,
and he got only himself.

233
00:15:03.986 --> 00:15:05.195
I do not accept excuses.

234
00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:07.531
I'm just going to have to
find myself a new giant, that's all.

235
00:15:07.615 --> 00:15:10.701
Don't say that, Vizzini. Please?

236
00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:19.501
Did I make it clear
that your job is at stake?

237
00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:21.170
[suspenseful music playing]

238
00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:36.101
[grunting]

239
00:16:20.688 --> 00:16:22.481
He's got very good arms.

240
00:16:24.525 --> 00:16:27.528
He didn't fall? Inconceivable.

241
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.697
You keep using that word.

242
00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.241
I do not think it means
what you think it means.

243
00:16:34.451 --> 00:16:36.203
My God. He's climbing.

244
00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:38.414
Whoever he is,

245
00:16:38.497 --> 00:16:41.333
he's obviously seen us with the Princess
and must, therefore, die.

246
00:16:41.417 --> 00:16:42.543
You, carry her.

247
00:16:42.626 --> 00:16:44.378
We'll head straight
for the Guilder frontier.

248
00:16:44.461 --> 00:16:45.504
Catch up when he's dead.

249
00:16:45.587 --> 00:16:48.215
If he falls, fine.
If not, the sword.

250
00:16:49.216 --> 00:16:50.676
I'm going to duel him
left-handed.

251
00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:52.886
You know
what a hurry we're in!

252
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.097
It's the only way
I can be satisfied.

253
00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.850
If I use my right,
over too quickly.

254
00:16:57.933 --> 00:16:59.560
Oh, have it your way.

255
00:17:07.192 --> 00:17:10.195
You be careful.
People in masks cannot be trusted.

256
00:17:11.905 --> 00:17:13.449
I'm waiting!

257
00:17:26.545 --> 00:17:27.629
Hello there!

258
00:17:31.675 --> 00:17:32.634
Slow going?

259
00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:37.056
Look, I don't mean to be rude,
but this is not as easy as it looks,

260
00:17:37.139 --> 00:17:39.349
so I'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't distract me.

261
00:17:39.433 --> 00:17:40.893
-Sorry.
-Thank you.

262
00:17:51.445 --> 00:17:53.572
I don't suppose
you could speed things up?

263
00:17:53.655 --> 00:17:57.868
If you're in such a hurry,
you could lower a rope or a tree branch,

264
00:17:57.951 --> 00:17:59.787
or find something
useful to do.

265
00:18:00.788 --> 00:18:04.166
I could do that.
I have got some rope up here.

266
00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:06.293
But I do not think
you would accept my help,

267
00:18:06.376 --> 00:18:08.462
since I am only waiting around
to kill you.

268
00:18:09.505 --> 00:18:11.381
That does put a damper
on our relationship.

269
00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:16.220
But I promise I will not kill you
until you reach the top.

270
00:18:16.804 --> 00:18:20.057
That's very comforting,
but I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.

271
00:18:20.557 --> 00:18:22.059
I hate waiting.

272
00:18:23.393 --> 00:18:25.354
I could give you my word
as a Spaniard.

273
00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:28.941
[grunting] No good.
I've known too many Spaniards.

274
00:18:29.024 --> 00:18:30.901
Is there any way
you'll trust me?

275
00:18:31.568 --> 00:18:33.237
Nothing comes to mind.

276
00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:36.865
I swear on the soul of my father,
Domingo Montoya,

277
00:18:37.991 --> 00:18:39.618
you will reach the top alive.

278
00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:41.829
Throw me the rope.

279
00:19:11.775 --> 00:19:13.610
Thank you.

280
00:19:13.694 --> 00:19:16.029
[stammers] We'll wait until you're ready.

281
00:19:17.364 --> 00:19:18.782
Again, thank you.

282
00:19:32.129 --> 00:19:34.840
I do not mean to pry,

283
00:19:34.923 --> 00:19:38.552
but you don't by any chance happen to have
six fingers on your right hand?

284
00:19:40.637 --> 00:19:42.389
Do you always begin
conversations this way?

285
00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.851
My father was slaughtered
by a six-fingered man.

286
00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:55.277
He was a great sword maker,
my father.

287
00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.946
When the six-fingered man
appeared and requested a special sword,

288
00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.781
my father took the job.

289
00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:03.327
He slaved a year
before he was done.

290
00:20:13.629 --> 00:20:15.339
I've never seen its equal.

291
00:20:17.174 --> 00:20:20.302
The six-fingered man
returned and demanded it,

292
00:20:20.385 --> 00:20:23.472
but at one-tenth
his promised price.

293
00:20:23.555 --> 00:20:26.099
My father refused.

294
00:20:26.183 --> 00:20:29.895
Without a word, the six-fingered man
slashed him through the heart.

295
00:20:31.355 --> 00:20:32.898
I loved my father.

296
00:20:32.981 --> 00:20:36.151
So, naturally, I challenged
his murderer to a duel.

297
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.029
I failed.

298
00:20:40.864 --> 00:20:43.408
The six-fingered man
leave me alive.

299
00:20:44.785 --> 00:20:46.620
But he gave me these.

300
00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:50.415
How old were you?

301
00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:52.376
I was 11 years old.

302
00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.629
When I was strong enough,

303
00:20:55.712 --> 00:20:59.174
I dedicated my life
to the study of fencing.

304
00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:03.762
So, the next time we meet,
I will not fail.

305
00:21:05.722 --> 00:21:08.475
I will go up
to the six-fingered man and say,

306
00:21:09.226 --> 00:21:13.272
"Hello. My name
is Inigo Montoya.

307
00:21:14.356 --> 00:21:18.360
You killed my father.
Prepare to die."

308
00:21:20.487 --> 00:21:22.364
You've done nothing
but study swordplay?

309
00:21:23.532 --> 00:21:25.617
More pursue it
than study, lately.

310
00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:28.328
You see, I cannot find him.

311
00:21:28.412 --> 00:21:31.623
It has been 20 years now.
I'm starting to lose confidence.

312
00:21:31.707 --> 00:21:33.834
I just work for Vizzini
to pay the bills.

313
00:21:33.917 --> 00:21:35.711
There's not a lot of money
in revenge.

314
00:21:38.338 --> 00:21:41.133
Well, I certainly hope
you find him someday.

315
00:21:41.216 --> 00:21:42.467
You're ready then?

316
00:21:42.551 --> 00:21:44.177
Whether I am or not,
you've been more than fair.

317
00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:47.639
You seem a decent fellow.
I hate to kill you.

318
00:21:47.723 --> 00:21:50.183
You seem a decent fellow.
I hate to die.

319
00:21:52.144 --> 00:21:53.770
Begin.

320
00:22:25.719 --> 00:22:27.971
You are using
Bonetti's defense against me, huh?

321
00:22:28.055 --> 00:22:31.266
I thought it fitting,
considering the rocky terrain.

322
00:22:31.349 --> 00:22:34.102
Naturally, you must expect me
to attack with Capo Ferro.

323
00:22:34.186 --> 00:22:37.814
Naturally. But I find that Thibault
cancels out Capo Ferro, don't you?

324
00:22:39.691 --> 00:22:41.526
Unless the enemy
has studied his Agrippa.

325
00:22:43.528 --> 00:22:45.072
Which I have!

326
00:22:50.077 --> 00:22:51.912
-You are wonderful.
-Thank you.

327
00:22:51.995 --> 00:22:53.497
I've worked hard
to become so.

328
00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.540
I admit that you are
better than I am.

329
00:22:55.624 --> 00:22:57.000
Then why are you smiling?

330
00:22:57.084 --> 00:22:59.002
Because I know something
you don't know.

331
00:22:59.086 --> 00:23:00.253
And what is that?

332
00:23:00.337 --> 00:23:02.047
I am not left-handed.

333
00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.556
[grunting]

334
00:23:13.767 --> 00:23:14.851
You are amazing.

335
00:23:14.935 --> 00:23:16.978
I ought to be,
after 20 years.

336
00:23:17.062 --> 00:23:19.231
[grunting] There's something
I ought to tell you.

337
00:23:19.314 --> 00:23:20.482
Tell me.

338
00:23:21.191 --> 00:23:22.609
I'm not left-handed either.

339
00:23:49.553 --> 00:23:50.846
Who are you?

340
00:23:50.929 --> 00:23:52.472
No one of consequence.

341
00:23:52.556 --> 00:23:54.057
I must know.

342
00:23:54.141 --> 00:23:55.767
Get used to disappointment.

343
00:23:55.851 --> 00:23:57.269
Okay.

344
00:23:57.602 --> 00:23:59.604
[suspenseful music playing]

345
00:24:26.715 --> 00:24:27.924
[Inigo grunting]

346
00:24:38.435 --> 00:24:40.061
[panting]

347
00:24:40.145 --> 00:24:42.063
Kill me quickly.

348
00:24:42.147 --> 00:24:43.899
I would as soon destroy
a stained-glass window

349
00:24:43.982 --> 00:24:45.817
as an artist like yourself.

350
00:24:45.901 --> 00:24:48.236
However, since I can't have
you following me, either...

351
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.404
[groans]

352
00:24:52.574 --> 00:24:55.118
Please understand, I hold you
in the highest respect.

353
00:25:07.172 --> 00:25:08.757
Inconceivable!

354
00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.967
Give her to me.
Catch up with us quickly.

355
00:25:11.051 --> 00:25:12.302
What do I do?

356
00:25:12.385 --> 00:25:15.055
Finish him.
Finish him your way!

357
00:25:15.138 --> 00:25:17.557
Oh, good. My way.
Thank you, Vizzini.

358
00:25:18.934 --> 00:25:20.060
Which one's my way?

359
00:25:20.894 --> 00:25:23.939
Pick up one of those rocks.
Get behind the boulder.

360
00:25:24.022 --> 00:25:26.858
In a few minutes, the man in black
will come running around the bend.

361
00:25:26.942 --> 00:25:30.445
The minute his head is in view,
hit it with the rock!

362
00:25:32.697 --> 00:25:35.158
My way's not
very sportsmanlike.

363
00:26:04.521 --> 00:26:07.649
I did that on purpose.
I didn't have to miss.

364
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.776
I believe you.

365
00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:12.279
So what happens now?

366
00:26:13.071 --> 00:26:15.240
We face each other
as God intended.

367
00:26:15.323 --> 00:26:20.328
Sportsmanlike. No tricks. No weapons.
Skill against skill alone.

368
00:26:21.204 --> 00:26:24.541
You mean, you'll put down your rock
and I'll put down my sword,

369
00:26:24.624 --> 00:26:26.835
and we'll try and kill each other
like civilized people?

370
00:26:27.377 --> 00:26:28.878
I could kill you now.

371
00:26:29.754 --> 00:26:34.175
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly
in your favor at hand-fighting.

372
00:26:35.051 --> 00:26:38.138
It's not my fault for being
the biggest and the strongest.

373
00:26:38.221 --> 00:26:39.597
I don't even exercise.

374
00:26:44.894 --> 00:26:45.812
[grunts]

375
00:26:51.651 --> 00:26:53.695
[grunting]

376
00:26:59.868 --> 00:27:02.579
Look, are you just fiddling around
with me, or what?

377
00:27:02.662 --> 00:27:05.165
I just want you to feel
you're doing well.

378
00:27:05.248 --> 00:27:07.167
I hate for people
to die embarrassed.

379
00:27:09.711 --> 00:27:10.754
You're quick.

380
00:27:10.837 --> 00:27:12.172
And a good thing, too.

381
00:27:12.255 --> 00:27:13.423
Why are you wearing a mask?

382
00:27:13.506 --> 00:27:16.009
Were you burned by acid
or something like that?

383
00:27:16.092 --> 00:27:17.761
No, it's just that they're
terribly comfortable.

384
00:27:17.844 --> 00:27:19.429
I think everyone will be
wearing them in the future.

385
00:27:23.767 --> 00:27:27.020
[grunting] I just figured why
you give me so much trouble.

386
00:27:28.188 --> 00:27:29.230
[groaning]

387
00:27:29.314 --> 00:27:31.858
Why's that, do you think?

388
00:27:31.941 --> 00:27:37.322
Well, I haven't fought
just one person for so long.

389
00:27:37.405 --> 00:27:38.406
[grunts]

390
00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.950
I've been specializing
in groups,

391
00:27:41.034 --> 00:27:44.746
battling gangs for local charities,
that kind of thing.

392
00:27:45.497 --> 00:27:46.998
[grunts]

393
00:27:47.082 --> 00:27:50.460
Why should that make
such a... [grunts] difference?

394
00:27:50.543 --> 00:27:53.380
Well, you see,
you use different moves...

395
00:27:53.463 --> 00:27:58.718
[grunting] when you're fighting
half a dozen people

396
00:27:58.802 --> 00:28:03.556
than when you only have to be
worried about one.

397
00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:20.281
I don't envy you the headache
you will have when you awake.

398
00:28:20.365 --> 00:28:24.244
But in the meantime,
rest well and dream of large women.

399
00:28:42.303 --> 00:28:46.349
There was a mighty duel.

400
00:28:48.601 --> 00:28:52.897
It ranged all over.
They were both masters.

401
00:28:52.981 --> 00:28:55.316
Who won? How did it end?

402
00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.695
The loser ran off alone...

403
00:29:00.363 --> 00:29:02.407
but the winner

404
00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:06.453
followed those footprints
toward Guilder.

405
00:29:06.536 --> 00:29:07.912
Shall we track them both?

406
00:29:08.872 --> 00:29:11.958
The loser is nothing.
Only the Princess matters.

407
00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.837
Clearly, this was all planned
by warriors of Guilder.

408
00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:19.257
We must all be ready
for whatever lies ahead.

409
00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:20.592
Could this be a trap?

410
00:29:20.675 --> 00:29:23.511
I always think
everything could be a trap,

411
00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:26.139
-which is why I'm still alive.
-[horse neighs]

412
00:29:35.565 --> 00:29:38.693
So, it is down to you

413
00:29:38.777 --> 00:29:40.528
and it is down to me.

414
00:29:43.448 --> 00:29:46.493
If you wish her dead,
by all means, keep moving forward.

415
00:29:47.994 --> 00:29:49.412
Let me explain.

416
00:29:49.496 --> 00:29:50.872
There's nothing to explain.

417
00:29:50.955 --> 00:29:53.666
You're trying to kidnap
what I've rightfully stolen.

418
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:56.586
Perhaps an arrangement
can be reached?

419
00:29:56.669 --> 00:30:00.381
There will be no arrangement,
and you're killing her.

420
00:30:00.465 --> 00:30:01.382
[gasps]

421
00:30:03.802 --> 00:30:06.638
Well, if there can be no arrangement,
then we are at an impasse.

422
00:30:06.721 --> 00:30:10.975
I'm afraid so. I can't compete
with you physically,

423
00:30:11.059 --> 00:30:13.144
and you're no match
for my brains.

424
00:30:13.228 --> 00:30:14.354
You're that smart?

425
00:30:14.437 --> 00:30:15.522
Let me put it this way.

426
00:30:15.605 --> 00:30:18.775
Have you ever heard of Plato,
Aristotle, Socrates?

427
00:30:18.858 --> 00:30:19.859
Yes.

428
00:30:19.943 --> 00:30:20.985
Morons.

429
00:30:21.069 --> 00:30:22.195
Really?

430
00:30:23.238 --> 00:30:25.740
In that case, I challenge you
to a battle of wits.

431
00:30:25.824 --> 00:30:26.825
For the Princess?

432
00:30:28.368 --> 00:30:29.494
To the death?

433
00:30:30.745 --> 00:30:32.247
I accept.

434
00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:34.207
Good, then pour the wine.

435
00:30:49.973 --> 00:30:52.016
Inhale this,
but do not touch.

436
00:30:54.435 --> 00:30:55.728
I smell nothing.

437
00:30:55.812 --> 00:30:58.314
What you do not smell is
called iocane powder.

438
00:30:58.398 --> 00:31:00.733
It is odorless, tasteless,
dissolves instantly in liquid,

439
00:31:00.817 --> 00:31:03.278
and is among the more deadly poisons
known to man.

440
00:31:03.361 --> 00:31:04.362
Hmm.

441
00:31:23.965 --> 00:31:25.258
[chuckles]

442
00:31:26.593 --> 00:31:29.012
All right.
Where is the poison?

443
00:31:29.095 --> 00:31:31.055
The battle of wits has begun.

444
00:31:31.139 --> 00:31:33.099
It ends when you decide,
and we both drink

445
00:31:33.182 --> 00:31:36.394
and find out who is right
and who is dead.

446
00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.147
But it's so simple.

447
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:42.442
All I have to do is divine
from what I know of you.

448
00:31:42.525 --> 00:31:44.319
Are you the sort of man

449
00:31:44.402 --> 00:31:47.405
who would put the poison
into his own goblet or his enemy's?

450
00:31:47.488 --> 00:31:50.408
Now, a clever man would put
the poison into his own goblet

451
00:31:50.491 --> 00:31:51.409
because he would know

452
00:31:51.492 --> 00:31:53.703
that only a great fool would reach
for what he was given.

453
00:31:53.786 --> 00:31:54.787
I'm not a great fool,

454
00:31:54.871 --> 00:31:57.916
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of you.

455
00:31:57.999 --> 00:32:00.543
But you must have known
I was not a great fool.

456
00:32:00.627 --> 00:32:01.669
You would've counted on it,

457
00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:04.881
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me.

458
00:32:04.964 --> 00:32:06.257
You've made your decision,
then?

459
00:32:06.341 --> 00:32:07.634
Not remotely.

460
00:32:07.717 --> 00:32:10.970
Because iocane comes from Australia,
as everyone knows,

461
00:32:11.054 --> 00:32:13.556
and Australia is entirely
peopled with criminals,

462
00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.309
and criminals are used
to having people not trust them,

463
00:32:16.392 --> 00:32:17.852
as you are not trusted by me,

464
00:32:17.936 --> 00:32:20.271
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of you.

465
00:32:20.355 --> 00:32:22.440
Truly, you have
a dizzying intellect.

466
00:32:22.523 --> 00:32:24.400
Wait till I get going.

467
00:32:24.484 --> 00:32:26.444
-Where was I?
-Australia.

468
00:32:26.527 --> 00:32:27.654
Yes. Australia.

469
00:32:27.737 --> 00:32:30.239
And you must have suspected
I would have known the powder's origin,

470
00:32:30.323 --> 00:32:32.742
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me.

471
00:32:32.825 --> 00:32:34.035
You're just stalling now.

472
00:32:34.118 --> 00:32:36.579
You'd like to think that,
wouldn't you?

473
00:32:36.663 --> 00:32:39.666
You've beaten my giant,
which means you're exceptionally strong,

474
00:32:39.749 --> 00:32:41.793
so you could've put the poison
in your own goblet,

475
00:32:41.876 --> 00:32:43.378
trusting on your strength
to save you,

476
00:32:43.461 --> 00:32:46.255
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of you.

477
00:32:46.339 --> 00:32:50.093
But you've also bested my Spaniard,
which means you must've studied,

478
00:32:50.176 --> 00:32:53.012
and in studying,
you must have learned that man is mortal,

479
00:32:53.096 --> 00:32:56.307
so you would've put the poison
as far from yourself as possible,

480
00:32:56.391 --> 00:32:59.227
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me.

481
00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:01.437
You're trying to trick me
into giving away something.

482
00:33:01.521 --> 00:33:02.397
It won't work.

483
00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.691
It has worked!
You've given everything away.

484
00:33:04.774 --> 00:33:06.275
I know where the poison is.

485
00:33:06.359 --> 00:33:07.276
Then make your choice.

486
00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.195
I will, and I choose...

487
00:33:09.278 --> 00:33:10.822
What in the world can that be?

488
00:33:10.905 --> 00:33:12.240
What? Where?

489
00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:15.493
I don't see anything.

490
00:33:15.576 --> 00:33:17.495
Oh. I... I could've sworn
I saw something.

491
00:33:17.578 --> 00:33:19.288
No matter.

492
00:33:19.372 --> 00:33:21.457
[chuckling]

493
00:33:21.541 --> 00:33:23.042
What's so funny?

494
00:33:23.126 --> 00:33:24.877
I'll tell you in a minute.

495
00:33:24.961 --> 00:33:26.713
First, let's drink.

496
00:33:26.796 --> 00:33:29.757
Me from my glass
and you from yours.

497
00:33:42.645 --> 00:33:44.063
[chuckling]

498
00:33:44.147 --> 00:33:45.314
You guessed wrong.

499
00:33:45.398 --> 00:33:47.150
You only think
I guessed wrong.

500
00:33:47.233 --> 00:33:48.151
That's what's so funny!

501
00:33:48.234 --> 00:33:50.111
I switched glasses
when your back was turned!

502
00:33:50.194 --> 00:33:54.365
[laughing] You fool, you fell victim
to one of the classic blunders.

503
00:33:54.449 --> 00:33:57.577
The most famous is never get involved
in a land war in Asia,

504
00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.663
but only slightly less
well known is this.

505
00:34:00.747 --> 00:34:04.834
Never go in against a Sicilian
when death is on the line!

506
00:34:04.917 --> 00:34:06.919
[laughing]

507
00:34:11.382 --> 00:34:12.300
[body thuds]

508
00:34:19.766 --> 00:34:20.808
Who are you?

509
00:34:20.892 --> 00:34:22.643
I'm no one to be trifled with.

510
00:34:22.727 --> 00:34:24.353
That is all you ever need know.

511
00:34:25.396 --> 00:34:28.941
To think, all that time
it was your cup that was poisoned.

512
00:34:29.025 --> 00:34:30.693
They were both poisoned.

513
00:34:31.819 --> 00:34:34.989
I spent the last few years
building up an immunity to iocane powder.

514
00:34:38.576 --> 00:34:40.745
Someone has beaten a giant.

515
00:34:43.039 --> 00:34:45.792
There will be great suffering
in Guilder if she dies.

516
00:35:01.641 --> 00:35:02.809
-[breathes heavily]
-Catch your breath.

517
00:35:02.892 --> 00:35:04.602
If you'll release me,

518
00:35:04.685 --> 00:35:07.480
whatever you ask for ransom,
you'll get it, I promise you.

519
00:35:07.563 --> 00:35:09.690
[laughing]

520
00:35:09.982 --> 00:35:12.652
And what is that worth,
the promise of a woman?

521
00:35:12.735 --> 00:35:14.028
You're very funny, Highness.

522
00:35:14.112 --> 00:35:16.572
I was giving you a chance.

523
00:35:16.656 --> 00:35:18.324
It does not matter where you take me.

524
00:35:18.407 --> 00:35:20.743
There's no greater hunter
than Prince Humperdinck.

525
00:35:20.827 --> 00:35:24.080
He can track a falcon on a cloudy day.
He can find you.

526
00:35:24.163 --> 00:35:25.665
You think your dearest love
will save you?

527
00:35:25.748 --> 00:35:27.750
I never said
he was my dearest love,

528
00:35:27.834 --> 00:35:30.086
and yes, he will save me.
That I know.

529
00:35:30.962 --> 00:35:33.756
You admit to me
you do not love your fiance?

530
00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.466
He knows I do not love him.

531
00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:37.635
Are not capable of love,
is what you mean.

532
00:35:40.096 --> 00:35:41.472
I have loved more deeply

533
00:35:41.556 --> 00:35:44.016
than a killer like yourself
could ever dream.

534
00:35:47.019 --> 00:35:48.813
That was a warning,
Highness.

535
00:35:48.896 --> 00:35:50.523
The next time,
my hand flies on its own,

536
00:35:50.606 --> 00:35:53.276
for where I come from,
there are penalties when a woman lies.

537
00:35:59.657 --> 00:36:02.034
Iocane. I'd bet my life on it.

538
00:36:03.202 --> 00:36:05.454
And there are
the Princess's footprints.

539
00:36:05.538 --> 00:36:08.166
She is alive, or was,
an hour ago.

540
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.462
If she is otherwise when I find her,
I shall be very put out.

541
00:36:20.178 --> 00:36:21.387
Rest, Highness.

542
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:22.388
I know who you are.

543
00:36:22.471 --> 00:36:24.640
Your cruelty
reveals everything.

544
00:36:24.724 --> 00:36:26.851
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts.
Admit it.

545
00:36:26.934 --> 00:36:28.686
With pride.

546
00:36:28.769 --> 00:36:30.354
What can I do for you?

547
00:36:30.438 --> 00:36:33.357
You can die slowly,
cut into a thousand pieces.

548
00:36:33.441 --> 00:36:35.109
[clicking tongue]

549
00:36:35.193 --> 00:36:38.946
Hardly complimentary, Your Highness.
Why loose your venom on me?

550
00:36:40.114 --> 00:36:41.741
You killed my love.

551
00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:45.620
It's possible.
I kill a lot of people.

552
00:36:47.288 --> 00:36:50.666
Who was this love of yours?
Another prince like this one?

553
00:36:51.626 --> 00:36:53.753
Ugly, rich and scabby?

554
00:36:53.836 --> 00:36:57.131
No, a farm boy. Poor.

555
00:36:57.215 --> 00:36:59.050
Poor and perfect.

556
00:37:00.176 --> 00:37:03.054
With eyes like the sea
after a storm.

557
00:37:06.557 --> 00:37:08.309
On the high seas
your ship attacked,

558
00:37:08.392 --> 00:37:10.436
and the Dread Pirate Roberts
never takes prisoners.

559
00:37:10.519 --> 00:37:12.438
I can't afford
to make exceptions.

560
00:37:12.521 --> 00:37:14.774
I mean, once word leaks out
that a pirate has gone soft,

561
00:37:14.857 --> 00:37:15.900
people begin to disobey you,

562
00:37:15.983 --> 00:37:17.902
and then it's nothing
but work, work, work all the time.

563
00:37:17.985 --> 00:37:19.362
You mock my pain!

564
00:37:19.445 --> 00:37:21.239
Life is pain, Highness.

565
00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:24.033
Anyone who says differently
is selling something.

566
00:37:28.162 --> 00:37:31.207
I remember this farm boy
of yours, I think.

567
00:37:32.208 --> 00:37:34.126
This would be what?
Five years ago?

568
00:37:35.419 --> 00:37:37.755
Does it bother you to hear?

569
00:37:37.838 --> 00:37:39.757
Nothing you can say will upset me.

570
00:37:41.008 --> 00:37:43.761
He died well.
That should please you.

571
00:37:44.345 --> 00:37:46.514
No bribe attempts or blubbering.

572
00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:52.561
He simply said, "Please.
Please, I need to live."

573
00:37:53.771 --> 00:37:56.691
It was the "please"
that caught my memory.

574
00:37:56.774 --> 00:37:58.818
I asked him what was
so important for him.

575
00:37:59.819 --> 00:38:01.487
"True love," he replied.

576
00:38:04.615 --> 00:38:07.994
And then he spoke of a girl
of surpassing beauty and faithfulness.

577
00:38:08.077 --> 00:38:09.912
I can only assume he meant you.

578
00:38:10.746 --> 00:38:12.540
You should bless me
for destroying him

579
00:38:12.623 --> 00:38:14.542
before he found out
what you really are.

580
00:38:15.376 --> 00:38:16.669
And what am I?

581
00:38:16.752 --> 00:38:19.422
Faithfulness he talked of, madam.
Your enduring faithfulness.

582
00:38:19.505 --> 00:38:21.424
Now tell me truly.
When you found out he was gone,

583
00:38:21.507 --> 00:38:23.217
did you get engaged
to your prince that same hour,

584
00:38:23.301 --> 00:38:25.052
or did you wait a whole week
out of respect for the dead?

585
00:38:25.136 --> 00:38:27.847
You mocked me once.
Never do it again!

586
00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:29.307
I died that day!

587
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:30.933
[horses galloping]

588
00:38:33.436 --> 00:38:35.479
You can die, too, for all I care!

589
00:38:35.563 --> 00:38:36.397
[grunts]

590
00:38:37.356 --> 00:38:41.319
[shouting] As you wish.

591
00:38:41.402 --> 00:38:44.655
Oh, my sweet Westley!
What have I done?

592
00:38:45.364 --> 00:38:47.825
[Buttercup groaning]

593
00:38:47.908 --> 00:38:49.994
[pirate groaning]

594
00:39:04.508 --> 00:39:08.179
Disappeared.
He must have seen us closing in,

595
00:39:08.262 --> 00:39:11.057
which might account
for his panicking into error.

596
00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:14.435
Unless I am wrong,
and I am never wrong,

597
00:39:14.518 --> 00:39:16.604
they are headed dead
into the Fire Swamp.

598
00:39:28.616 --> 00:39:30.117
Can you move at all?

599
00:39:30.201 --> 00:39:34.538
Move? You're alive.
If you want, I can fly.

600
00:39:40.127 --> 00:39:43.172
I told you I would always
come for you.

601
00:39:43.255 --> 00:39:44.465
Why didn't you wait for me?

602
00:39:45.383 --> 00:39:47.676
Well, you were dead.

603
00:39:48.511 --> 00:39:50.596
Death cannot stop true love.

604
00:39:52.348 --> 00:39:54.517
All it can do is delay it for a while.

605
00:39:55.976 --> 00:39:57.937
I will never doubt again.

606
00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:00.898
There will never be a need.

607
00:40:04.527 --> 00:40:06.987
[grandson] Oh, no, no, please.

608
00:40:07.071 --> 00:40:09.156
What is it?
What's the matter?

609
00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.367
They're kissing again.

610
00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:13.744
Do we have to hear the kissing part?

611
00:40:13.828 --> 00:40:16.205
Someday, you may not
mind so much.

612
00:40:16.288 --> 00:40:18.833
Skip on to the Fire Swamp.
That sounded good.

613
00:40:18.916 --> 00:40:21.001
Oh. [slurps]

614
00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:23.295
You're sick. I'll humor you.

615
00:40:24.505 --> 00:40:26.799
So, now,
where were we here?

616
00:40:27.383 --> 00:40:29.218
Oh, okay.

617
00:40:29.301 --> 00:40:34.265
"Westley and Buttercup
raced along the ravine floor."

618
00:40:34.348 --> 00:40:35.349
[horse neighing]

619
00:40:35.433 --> 00:40:37.643
Ha! Your pig fiance is too late.

620
00:40:39.645 --> 00:40:42.440
A few more steps
and we'll be safe in the Fire Swamp.

621
00:40:43.566 --> 00:40:44.859
[Buttercup] We'll never survive.

622
00:40:44.942 --> 00:40:45.860
[Westley] Nonsense.

623
00:40:45.943 --> 00:40:48.154
You're only saying that
because no one ever has.

624
00:40:50.823 --> 00:40:52.658
[growling]

625
00:40:53.826 --> 00:40:55.911
[owl hooting]

626
00:41:09.133 --> 00:41:10.217
[animal squealing]

627
00:41:12.386 --> 00:41:13.679
[growling]

628
00:41:15.598 --> 00:41:17.057
It's not that bad.

629
00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:21.812
I'm not saying I'd like to build
a summer home here,

630
00:41:21.896 --> 00:41:23.898
but the trees
are actually quite lovely.

631
00:41:24.356 --> 00:41:25.900
[creaking]

632
00:41:25.983 --> 00:41:27.151
[thuds]

633
00:41:45.753 --> 00:41:46.921
[ominous popping]

634
00:41:50.925 --> 00:41:51.884
[gasps and screams]

635
00:41:57.431 --> 00:41:59.433
[whimpers]

636
00:42:02.478 --> 00:42:04.730
Well, now,
that was an adventure.

637
00:42:04.813 --> 00:42:07.191
Singed a bit, were you?

638
00:42:07.274 --> 00:42:08.108
You?

639
00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:13.072
[ominous popping]

640
00:42:15.616 --> 00:42:17.701
Well, one thing I will say,

641
00:42:17.785 --> 00:42:20.120
the Fire Swamp certainly does
keep you on your toes.

642
00:42:21.205 --> 00:42:22.498
[creaks and thuds]

643
00:42:27.002 --> 00:42:29.755
[Westley] This will all soon be
but a happy memory,

644
00:42:29.838 --> 00:42:32.383
because Roberts' ship,
Revenge, is anchored at the far end,

645
00:42:32.466 --> 00:42:34.552
and I, as you know,
am Roberts.

646
00:42:34.635 --> 00:42:35.844
But how is that possible,

647
00:42:35.928 --> 00:42:37.721
since he's been
marauding 20 years

648
00:42:37.805 --> 00:42:39.890
and you only left me
five years ago?

649
00:42:39.974 --> 00:42:42.810
I, myself, am often surprised
at life's little quirks.

650
00:42:42.893 --> 00:42:44.812
[ominous popping]

651
00:42:45.813 --> 00:42:48.440
See, what I told you before
about saying "please" was true.

652
00:42:49.984 --> 00:42:53.279
It intrigued Roberts,
as did my description of your beauty.

653
00:42:54.196 --> 00:42:56.532
Finally Roberts decided something.

654
00:42:56.615 --> 00:42:58.826
He said, "All right, Westley.

655
00:42:58.909 --> 00:43:01.745
I've never had a valet.
You can try it for tonight.

656
00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:03.998
I'll most likely kill you
in the morning."

657
00:43:04.081 --> 00:43:06.125
Three years, he said that.

658
00:43:06.208 --> 00:43:08.127
"Good night, Westley. Good work.

659
00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:10.754
Sleep well.
I'll most likely kill you in the morning."

660
00:43:10.838 --> 00:43:13.132
It was a fine time for me.
I was learning to fence, to fight,

661
00:43:13.215 --> 00:43:15.384
anything anyone
would teach me.

662
00:43:15.467 --> 00:43:17.970
And Roberts and I
eventually became friends.

663
00:43:18.053 --> 00:43:19.471
And then it happened.

664
00:43:19.555 --> 00:43:22.474
What? Go on.

665
00:43:22.558 --> 00:43:25.102
Roberts had grown so rich,
he wanted to retire.

666
00:43:25.185 --> 00:43:28.105
So he took me to his cabin
and told me a secret.

667
00:43:30.608 --> 00:43:32.818
"I am not the Dread
Pirate Roberts," he said.

668
00:43:32.901 --> 00:43:34.278
"My name is Ryan.

669
00:43:34.361 --> 00:43:37.364
I inherited the ship
from the previous Dread Pirate Roberts,

670
00:43:37.448 --> 00:43:39.241
just as you
will inherit it from me.

671
00:43:39.325 --> 00:43:42.119
The man I inherited it from was not
the real Dread Pirate Roberts either.

672
00:43:42.202 --> 00:43:44.330
His name was Cummerbund.

673
00:43:44.413 --> 00:43:46.498
The real Roberts had been
retired 15 years

674
00:43:46.582 --> 00:43:49.126
and living like a king in Patagonia."
Thank you.

675
00:43:49.209 --> 00:43:51.670
Then he explained the name
was the important thing

676
00:43:51.754 --> 00:43:53.631
for inspiring the necessary fear.

677
00:43:53.714 --> 00:43:56.967
You see, no one would surrender
to the Dread Pirate Westley.

678
00:43:58.552 --> 00:44:01.221
So, we sailed ashore,
took on an entirely new crew,

679
00:44:01.305 --> 00:44:03.474
and he stayed aboard
for a while, as first mate,

680
00:44:03.557 --> 00:44:05.726
all the time
calling me Roberts.

681
00:44:05.809 --> 00:44:07.728
Once the crew believed,
he left the ship

682
00:44:07.811 --> 00:44:10.064
and I have been Roberts
ever since.

683
00:44:10.147 --> 00:44:11.440
Except, now that we're together,

684
00:44:11.523 --> 00:44:14.026
I shall retire and hand the name
over to someone else.

685
00:44:14.109 --> 00:44:15.903
Is everything clear to you?

686
00:44:20.658 --> 00:44:21.617
[gasping]

687
00:44:43.972 --> 00:44:45.766
[snarling]

688
00:44:47.685 --> 00:44:49.770
[sniffing]

689
00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:02.825
[both gasping]

690
00:45:07.329 --> 00:45:08.622
[Buttercup coughing]

691
00:45:16.046 --> 00:45:17.089
[coughing]

692
00:45:18.173 --> 00:45:20.175
[breathing heavily]

693
00:45:22.428 --> 00:45:23.929
[coughing]

694
00:45:39.445 --> 00:45:40.821
[animal snarling]

695
00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:51.457
We'll never succeed.

696
00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:53.542
We may as well die here.

697
00:45:55.794 --> 00:45:59.256
No. No.
We have already succeeded.

698
00:46:01.592 --> 00:46:05.179
I mean, what are the three terrors
of the Fire Swamp?

699
00:46:05.262 --> 00:46:08.015
One, the flame spurt.
No problem.

700
00:46:08.098 --> 00:46:11.518
There's a popping sound preceding each.
We can avoid that.

701
00:46:11.602 --> 00:46:13.937
Two, the lightning sand,

702
00:46:14.021 --> 00:46:15.939
but you were clever enough
to discover what that looks like,

703
00:46:16.023 --> 00:46:17.649
so in the future,
we can avoid that, too.

704
00:46:17.733 --> 00:46:20.277
Westley, what about
the R.O.U.Ss?

705
00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:23.447
Rodents Of Unusual Size?
I don't think they exist.

706
00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:24.364
-[growling]
-[grunts]

707
00:46:29.286 --> 00:46:30.412
[snarling]

708
00:46:33.081 --> 00:46:34.875
[screaming]

709
00:46:37.544 --> 00:46:38.420
[grunts]

710
00:46:42.841 --> 00:46:44.801
[growling]

711
00:47:00.234 --> 00:47:01.276
Westley!

712
00:47:04.905 --> 00:47:06.949
[grunting]

713
00:47:15.999 --> 00:47:17.167
[Buttercup grunts]

714
00:47:24.216 --> 00:47:25.259
[groaning]

715
00:47:26.635 --> 00:47:28.387
[screaming]

716
00:47:28.845 --> 00:47:30.097
[ominous popping]

717
00:47:32.933 --> 00:47:34.101
[animal shrieking]

718
00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:43.527
[growling]

719
00:47:48.365 --> 00:47:50.325
[squealing]

720
00:48:15.434 --> 00:48:16.810
[Buttercup] We did it.

721
00:48:19.104 --> 00:48:20.647
Now, was that so terrible?

722
00:48:24.109 --> 00:48:25.110
[horse neighing]

723
00:48:32.075 --> 00:48:33.368
Surrender.

724
00:48:33.452 --> 00:48:35.162
You mean, you wish
to surrender to me?

725
00:48:35.245 --> 00:48:36.496
Very well. I accept.

726
00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:39.082
I give you
full marks for bravery.

727
00:48:39.166 --> 00:48:41.001
Don't make yourself a fool.

728
00:48:41.084 --> 00:48:42.711
Ah, but how will you capture us?

729
00:48:42.794 --> 00:48:44.630
We know the secrets
of the Fire Swamp.

730
00:48:44.713 --> 00:48:46.089
We can live there
quite happily for some time,

731
00:48:46.173 --> 00:48:48.133
so whenever you feel like dying,
feel free to visit.

732
00:48:48.925 --> 00:48:51.595
[Humperdinck]
I tell you once again, surrender!

733
00:48:51.678 --> 00:48:53.388
[Westley] It will not happen.

734
00:48:53.472 --> 00:48:55.223
For the last time, surrender!

735
00:48:55.307 --> 00:48:56.600
Death first!

736
00:48:56.683 --> 00:48:58.644
Will you promise not to hurt him?

737
00:48:58.727 --> 00:48:59.686
What was that?

738
00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:01.229
What was that?

739
00:49:01.938 --> 00:49:05.525
If we surrender,
and I return with you,

740
00:49:05.609 --> 00:49:07.819
will you promise
not to hurt this man?

741
00:49:07.903 --> 00:49:11.448
May I live a thousand years
and never hunt again.

742
00:49:11.531 --> 00:49:14.534
He is a sailor
on the pirate ship Revenge.

743
00:49:14.618 --> 00:49:16.703
Promise to return him
to his ship.

744
00:49:17.371 --> 00:49:19.206
I swear it will be done.

745
00:49:21.958 --> 00:49:23.960
Once we're out of sight,
take him back to Florin

746
00:49:24.044 --> 00:49:25.962
and throw him in the Pit of Despair.

747
00:49:26.046 --> 00:49:28.173
I swear it will be done.

748
00:49:29.633 --> 00:49:33.387
I thought you were dead once
and it almost destroyed me.

749
00:49:34.054 --> 00:49:38.225
I could not bear it if you died again,
not when I could save you.

750
00:49:51.113 --> 00:49:54.616
Come, sir.
We must get you to your ship.

751
00:50:01.623 --> 00:50:05.627
We are men of action.
Lies do not become us.

752
00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.131
Well spoken, sir.

753
00:50:16.138 --> 00:50:17.681
What is it?

754
00:50:17.764 --> 00:50:20.016
You have six fingers
on your right hand.

755
00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:21.893
Someone was looking for you.

756
00:50:23.228 --> 00:50:25.397
[water dripping]

757
00:50:26.106 --> 00:50:27.274
[door opens]

758
00:50:29.234 --> 00:50:30.527
[door closes]

759
00:51:07.814 --> 00:51:08.899
Where am I?

760
00:51:08.982 --> 00:51:11.401
[hoarsely] The Pit of Despair.

761
00:51:11.485 --> 00:51:12.819
Don't even think...

762
00:51:12.903 --> 00:51:14.404
[clearing throat]

763
00:51:16.865 --> 00:51:18.700
[normally] Don't even think
about trying to escape.

764
00:51:18.784 --> 00:51:20.660
The chains are far too thick.

765
00:51:21.203 --> 00:51:25.165
And don't dream of being rescued either.
The only way in is secret.

766
00:51:25.624 --> 00:51:28.502
Only the Prince, the Count and I know
how to get in and out.

767
00:51:29.336 --> 00:51:32.631
-Then I'm here till I die?
-Till they kill you, yeah.

768
00:51:38.887 --> 00:51:40.347
Then why bother curing me?

769
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:42.641
The Prince and the Count
always insist

770
00:51:42.724 --> 00:51:45.143
on everyone being healthy
before they're broken.

771
00:51:45.227 --> 00:51:46.895
So, it's to be torture?

772
00:51:48.688 --> 00:51:49.898
I can cope with torture.

773
00:51:53.026 --> 00:51:54.069
You don't believe me?

774
00:51:55.529 --> 00:51:58.073
You survived the Fire Swamp.
You must be very brave.

775
00:51:59.115 --> 00:52:01.827
But nobody withstands
the machine. [chuckles]

776
00:52:16.842 --> 00:52:18.927
She's been like that
ever since the Fire Swamp.

777
00:52:20.178 --> 00:52:22.639
It's my father's failing health
that's upsetting her.

778
00:52:23.807 --> 00:52:25.684
Of course.

779
00:52:27.727 --> 00:52:30.605
[grandfather] "The King died
that very night,

780
00:52:30.689 --> 00:52:32.816
and before the following dawn,

781
00:52:32.899 --> 00:52:35.151
Buttercup and Humperdinck
were married.

782
00:52:35.735 --> 00:52:38.071
And at noon,
she met her subjects again

783
00:52:38.154 --> 00:52:39.865
this time as their queen."

784
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:42.701
My father's
final words were...

785
00:52:42.784 --> 00:52:44.494
[grandson]
Hold it. Hold it, Grandpa.

786
00:52:44.578 --> 00:52:47.664
You read that wrong.
She doesn't marry Humperdinck.

787
00:52:47.747 --> 00:52:50.041
She marries Westley.
I'm just sure of it.

788
00:52:50.125 --> 00:52:52.168
After all
that Westley did for her,

789
00:52:52.252 --> 00:52:55.213
if she didn't marry him,
it wouldn't be fair.

790
00:52:55.297 --> 00:52:57.173
Well, who says life is fair?

791
00:52:57.257 --> 00:53:00.635
Where is that written?
Life isn't always fair.

792
00:53:00.719 --> 00:53:03.346
I'm telling you,
you're messing up the story.

793
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:04.681
Now, get it right!

794
00:53:04.806 --> 00:53:08.226
-Do you want me to go on with this?
-Yes.

795
00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:10.520
All right then.
No more interruptions.

796
00:53:10.604 --> 00:53:15.275
"At noon, she met her subjects again,
this time as their queen."

797
00:53:15.358 --> 00:53:18.778
My father's final words were,

798
00:53:18.862 --> 00:53:21.489
"Love her as I loved her,

799
00:53:21.573 --> 00:53:23.450
and there will be joy."

800
00:53:24.618 --> 00:53:27.203
I present to you your queen,

801
00:53:27.287 --> 00:53:30.624
Queen Buttercup.

802
00:53:31.374 --> 00:53:32.834
[people muttering]

803
00:53:32.918 --> 00:53:34.586
[bugles playing]

804
00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:43.219
[woman] Boo!

805
00:53:43.887 --> 00:53:45.847
Boo!

806
00:53:45.931 --> 00:53:48.266
Boo!

807
00:53:48.350 --> 00:53:49.809
Why do you do this?

808
00:53:49.893 --> 00:53:53.730
Because you had love in your hands
and you gave it up!

809
00:53:53.813 --> 00:53:56.232
But they would've killed Westley
if I hadn't done it.

810
00:53:56.316 --> 00:53:58.610
Your true love lives,

811
00:53:58.693 --> 00:54:00.320
and you marry another!

812
00:54:00.403 --> 00:54:03.073
True love saved her
in the Fire Swamp

813
00:54:03.156 --> 00:54:05.241
and she treated it
like garbage.

814
00:54:05.325 --> 00:54:08.828
And that's what she is,
the queen of refuse!

815
00:54:08.912 --> 00:54:11.581
So bow down to her
if you want, bow to her.

816
00:54:11.665 --> 00:54:15.335
Bow to the queen of slime,
the queen of filth,

817
00:54:15.418 --> 00:54:17.587
the queen of putrescence!

818
00:54:17.671 --> 00:54:19.881
Boo! Boo!

819
00:54:19.965 --> 00:54:22.425
Rubbish! Filth! Slime!

820
00:54:22.509 --> 00:54:25.887
Muck! Boo! Boo!

821
00:54:25.971 --> 00:54:27.389
Boo!

822
00:54:27.472 --> 00:54:28.640
[gasping]

823
00:54:30.725 --> 00:54:32.644
[grandfather] "It was ten days
till the wedding.

824
00:54:32.727 --> 00:54:34.479
The King still lived,

825
00:54:34.562 --> 00:54:37.399
but Buttercup's nightmares
were growing steadily worse."

826
00:54:37.732 --> 00:54:41.277
[grandson] See? Didn't I tell you
she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?

827
00:54:41.361 --> 00:54:43.279
[grandfather] Yes, you're very smart.
Shut up.

828
00:54:44.114 --> 00:54:48.201
It comes to this.
I love Westley. I always have.

829
00:54:48.952 --> 00:54:50.662
I know now, I always will.

830
00:54:50.745 --> 00:54:53.790
If you tell me
I must marry you in ten days,

831
00:54:53.873 --> 00:54:56.334
please believe
I will be dead by morning.

832
00:55:03.508 --> 00:55:05.927
I could never cause you grief.

833
00:55:07.053 --> 00:55:08.972
Consider our wedding off.

834
00:55:10.098 --> 00:55:14.477
You, uh, returned
this Westley to his ship?

835
00:55:14.561 --> 00:55:15.729
Yes.

836
00:55:16.187 --> 00:55:17.939
Then we will simply alert him.

837
00:55:19.024 --> 00:55:21.317
Beloved...

838
00:55:21.401 --> 00:55:24.529
are you certain
he still wants you?

839
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:29.034
After all, it was you who did the leaving
in the Fire Swamp.

840
00:55:29.117 --> 00:55:30.785
Not to mention that, uh,

841
00:55:30.869 --> 00:55:33.496
pirates are not known
to be men of their words.

842
00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:35.999
My Westley
will always come for me.

843
00:55:37.584 --> 00:55:39.002
Uh...

844
00:55:42.922 --> 00:55:44.841
I suggest a deal.

845
00:55:44.924 --> 00:55:47.677
You'll write four copies
of a letter.

846
00:55:47.761 --> 00:55:50.930
I'll send my four fastest ships,
one in each direction.

847
00:55:51.598 --> 00:55:54.517
The Dread Pirate Roberts is always
close to Florin this time of year.

848
00:55:54.601 --> 00:55:57.479
We'll run up the white flag
and deliver your message.

849
00:55:57.562 --> 00:56:00.523
If Westley wants you,
bless you both.

850
00:56:01.983 --> 00:56:03.026
If not...

851
00:56:06.446 --> 00:56:09.949
please consider me
as an alternative to suicide.

852
00:56:11.451 --> 00:56:12.702
Are we agreed?

853
00:56:16.915 --> 00:56:20.376
Your princess is really
quite a winning creature.

854
00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:23.129
A trifle simple, perhaps,
but her appeal is undeniable.

855
00:56:23.213 --> 00:56:25.048
I know. The people
are quite taken with her.

856
00:56:25.423 --> 00:56:26.966
It's odd,

857
00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:29.928
but when I hired Vizzini to have
her murdered on our engagement day,

858
00:56:30.011 --> 00:56:31.513
I thought that was clever.

859
00:56:31.596 --> 00:56:32.972
But it's going to be
so much more moving

860
00:56:33.056 --> 00:56:35.558
when I strangle her
on our wedding night.

861
00:56:35.642 --> 00:56:39.270
Once Guilder is blamed,
the nation will be truly outraged.

862
00:56:39.354 --> 00:56:41.231
They'll demand we go to war.

863
00:56:41.314 --> 00:56:42.732
[chuckling]

864
00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:46.861
Now, where is that secret knot?

865
00:56:48.113 --> 00:56:49.781
It's impossible to find.

866
00:56:51.991 --> 00:56:53.451
Ah!

867
00:56:53.535 --> 00:56:55.411
Are you coming down
into the pit?

868
00:56:55.495 --> 00:56:56.996
Westley's got
his strength back.

869
00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:59.541
I'm starting him
on the machine tonight.

870
00:56:59.624 --> 00:57:01.626
Tyrone,

871
00:57:01.709 --> 00:57:04.379
you know how much I love
watching you work.

872
00:57:04.462 --> 00:57:06.840
But I've got my country's
500th anniversary to plan,

873
00:57:06.923 --> 00:57:09.259
my wedding to arrange,
my wife to murder,

874
00:57:09.342 --> 00:57:12.554
and Guilder to frame for it.
I'm swamped.

875
00:57:15.932 --> 00:57:17.517
Get some rest.

876
00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:20.228
If you haven't got your health,
you haven't got anything.

877
00:57:37.287 --> 00:57:38.496
Beautiful, isn't it?

878
00:57:39.706 --> 00:57:42.208
Took me half a lifetime
to invent it.

879
00:57:43.710 --> 00:57:47.130
I'm sure you've discovered
my deep and abiding interest in pain.

880
00:57:47.213 --> 00:57:50.383
At present, I'm writing
the definitive work on the subject.

881
00:57:50.467 --> 00:57:52.844
So, I want you to be
totally honest with me

882
00:57:52.927 --> 00:57:54.721
on how the machine
makes you feel.

883
00:57:55.722 --> 00:57:59.184
This being our first try,
I'll use the lowest setting.

884
00:58:16.326 --> 00:58:17.619
[groaning]

885
00:58:28.671 --> 00:58:29.672
[grunting]

886
00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:39.015
As you know, the concept
of the suction pump is centuries old.

887
00:58:40.558 --> 00:58:42.185
Really, that's all this is,

888
00:58:42.268 --> 00:58:45.730
except that instead of sucking water,
I'm sucking life.

889
00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:49.734
I've just sucked
one year of your life away.

890
00:58:50.527 --> 00:58:53.029
I might one day
go as high as five,

891
00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:55.782
but I really don't know
what that would do to you.

892
00:58:55.865 --> 00:58:57.742
So, let's just start
with what we have.

893
00:58:58.743 --> 00:59:01.579
What did this do to you?
Tell me.

894
00:59:01.663 --> 00:59:05.416
And remember,
this is for posterity, so be honest.

895
00:59:05.875 --> 00:59:07.210
How do you feel?

896
00:59:07.961 --> 00:59:09.671
[whimpering]

897
00:59:12.090 --> 00:59:14.008
Interesting.

898
00:59:21.558 --> 00:59:22.809
[Yellin clears throat]

899
00:59:23.893 --> 00:59:25.019
Yellin.

900
00:59:25.103 --> 00:59:26.104
Sire.

901
00:59:35.905 --> 00:59:37.907
As Chief Enforcer
of all Florin,

902
00:59:37.991 --> 00:59:40.034
I trust you
with this secret.

903
00:59:40.702 --> 00:59:43.955
Killers from Guilder
are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest

904
00:59:44.038 --> 00:59:47.333
and plan to murder my bride
on our wedding night.

905
00:59:48.918 --> 00:59:51.379
My spy network has
heard no such news.

906
00:59:51.462 --> 00:59:52.755
[Buttercup] Any word from Westley?

907
00:59:54.882 --> 00:59:56.968
Too soon, my angel.

908
00:59:57.385 --> 00:59:58.511
Patience.

909
00:59:58.595 --> 00:59:59.721
He will come for me.

910
00:59:59.804 --> 01:00:01.097
Of course.

911
01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:08.146
She will not be murdered!

912
01:00:08.396 --> 01:00:11.608
On the day of the wedding,
I want the Thieves' Forest emptied

913
01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:13.776
and every inhabitant arrested.

914
01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:16.029
[sighing] Many of the thieves
will resist.

915
01:00:16.112 --> 01:00:18.281
My regular enforcers
will be inadequate.

916
01:00:18.364 --> 01:00:19.699
Form a Brute Squad, then!

917
01:00:20.533 --> 01:00:23.578
I want the Thieves' Forest
emptied before I wed.

918
01:00:23.661 --> 01:00:25.288
It won't be easy, sire.

919
01:00:25.371 --> 01:00:27.332
Try ruling the world sometime.

920
01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:32.587
[people clamoring]

921
01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:34.631
[grandfather] "The day
of the wedding arrived.

922
01:00:34.714 --> 01:00:38.009
The Brute Squad had their hands full
carrying out Humperdinck's orders."

923
01:00:38.092 --> 01:00:39.385
[neighing]

924
01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:40.803
[men shouting]

925
01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:46.809
-Is everybody out?
-Almost.

926
01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:48.978
There's a Spaniard
giving us some trouble.

927
01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:51.272
Well, you give him
some trouble.

928
01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:53.566
Move.

929
01:00:58.154 --> 01:01:00.281
I am waiting for you, Vizzini.

930
01:01:01.449 --> 01:01:05.662
You told me to go back
to the beginning, so I have.

931
01:01:05.745 --> 01:01:09.540
This is where I am
and this is where I will stay.

932
01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:12.085
I will not be moved.

933
01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:14.212
Ho, there!

934
01:01:15.463 --> 01:01:17.590
I do not budge.
Keep your "Ho, there."

935
01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:19.175
But the Prince gave orders.

936
01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:22.136
[grunting]

937
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:23.888
So did Vizzini.

938
01:01:23.971 --> 01:01:26.307
When a job went wrong,
you went back to the beginning.

939
01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:29.686
Well, this is where we got the job,
so it's the beginning.

940
01:01:30.103 --> 01:01:32.146
And I am staying
till Vizzini comes.

941
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:33.898
You, Brute, come here!

942
01:01:33.981 --> 01:01:36.317
I am waiting

943
01:01:36.401 --> 01:01:38.611
for Vizzini.

944
01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:41.656
[Fezzik] You surely are a meanie.

945
01:01:49.831 --> 01:01:51.290
Hello.

946
01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:52.625
It's you.

947
01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:54.168
True.

948
01:01:54.252 --> 01:01:55.253
[groans]

949
01:01:56.337 --> 01:01:57.672
You don't look so good.

950
01:01:57.755 --> 01:01:59.006
[sputtering]

951
01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:00.258
Ugh.

952
01:02:00.341 --> 01:02:01.801
You don't smell
so good either.

953
01:02:02.343 --> 01:02:05.680
Perhaps not.
I feel fine.

954
01:02:08.474 --> 01:02:09.559
[thudding]

955
01:02:09.642 --> 01:02:12.145
[grandfather] "Fezzik and Inigo
were reunited.

956
01:02:12.228 --> 01:02:15.898
And as Fezzik nursed
his inebriated friend back to health,

957
01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:17.942
he told Inigo of Vizzini's death

958
01:02:18.025 --> 01:02:19.736
and the existence
of Count Rugen,

959
01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:21.028
the six-fingered man.

960
01:02:21.529 --> 01:02:23.573
Considering Inigo's
life-long search,

961
01:02:23.656 --> 01:02:25.700
he handled the news
surprisingly well.

962
01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:31.914
Fezzik took great care
in reviving Inigo."

963
01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:34.792
That's enough!
That's enough!

964
01:02:35.293 --> 01:02:38.171
Where is this Rugen now,
so I may kill him?

965
01:02:38.546 --> 01:02:40.673
He's with the Prince
in the castle.

966
01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:43.551
But the castle gate
is guarded by 30 men.

967
01:02:43.968 --> 01:02:45.052
[grunting]

968
01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:49.974
How many could you handle?

969
01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:52.226
I don't think more than ten.

970
01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.733
Leaving 20 for me.

971
01:03:00.401 --> 01:03:02.445
At my best, I could
never defeat that many.

972
01:03:06.073 --> 01:03:09.285
I need Vizzini to plan.
I have no gift for strategy.

973
01:03:09.368 --> 01:03:10.953
But Vizzini is dead.

974
01:03:11.579 --> 01:03:14.707
No. Not Vizzini.

975
01:03:15.666 --> 01:03:17.502
I need the man in black.

976
01:03:18.002 --> 01:03:18.920
What?

977
01:03:19.003 --> 01:03:22.340
Look. He bested you
with strength, your greatness.

978
01:03:22.423 --> 01:03:24.509
He bested me with steel.

979
01:03:24.592 --> 01:03:26.761
He must have
outthought Vizzini.

980
01:03:26.844 --> 01:03:30.723
And a man who can do that
can plan my castle onslaught any day.

981
01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:32.683
-Let's go.
-Where?

982
01:03:32.767 --> 01:03:33.893
Find the man in black,
obviously.

983
01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:35.311
But you don't know
where he is.

984
01:03:35.394 --> 01:03:37.146
Don't bother me with trifles.

985
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:39.690
After 20 years, at last my father's soul
will be at peace.

986
01:03:39.774 --> 01:03:41.567
There will be blood tonight!

987
01:03:52.995 --> 01:03:55.164
Rise and report.

988
01:03:55.248 --> 01:03:56.791
[Yellin] The Thieves' Forest
is emptied.

989
01:03:56.874 --> 01:03:58.876
Thirty men guard
the castle gate.

990
01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:02.088
Double it.
My princess must be safe.

991
01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:03.840
The gate has but one key.

992
01:04:05.758 --> 01:04:07.260
And I carry that.

993
01:04:07.343 --> 01:04:09.595
[footsteps approaching]

994
01:04:10.179 --> 01:04:13.182
Ah! My dulcet darling.

995
01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:17.603
Tonight, we marry.

996
01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:20.773
Tomorrow morning,
your men will escort us to Florin Channel,

997
01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:25.528
where every ship in my armada
waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.

998
01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:28.573
Every ship but your four fastest,
you mean.

999
01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:33.578
Every ship
but the four you sent.

1000
01:04:33.661 --> 01:04:37.623
Yes. Yes, of course.
Naturally, not those four.

1001
01:04:39.917 --> 01:04:41.377
[Clearing throat] Your Majesty.

1002
01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:46.924
You never sent the ships.

1003
01:04:47.675 --> 01:04:49.343
Don't bother lying.

1004
01:04:50.261 --> 01:04:53.097
It doesn't matter.
Westley will come for me anyway.

1005
01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:55.016
You're a silly girl.

1006
01:04:55.099 --> 01:04:57.059
Yes, I am a silly girl,

1007
01:04:57.143 --> 01:05:00.062
for not having seen sooner
that you are nothing but a coward

1008
01:05:00.146 --> 01:05:01.522
with a heart full of fear.

1009
01:05:02.857 --> 01:05:06.777
I would not say such things
if I were you.

1010
01:05:06.861 --> 01:05:09.906
Why not? You can't hurt me.

1011
01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:13.826
Westley and I are joined
by the bonds of love.

1012
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:15.745
And you cannot track that,

1013
01:05:15.828 --> 01:05:18.331
not with
a thousand bloodhounds.

1014
01:05:18.414 --> 01:05:22.251
And you cannot break it,
not with a thousand swords.

1015
01:05:22.335 --> 01:05:24.754
And when I say
you're a coward,

1016
01:05:24.837 --> 01:05:25.963
that is only because

1017
01:05:26.047 --> 01:05:28.549
you are the slimiest weakling
ever to crawl the earth!

1018
01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:34.305
I would not say
such things if I were you!

1019
01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:51.072
You truly love each other,

1020
01:05:51.155 --> 01:05:53.032
and so you might have been
truly happy.

1021
01:05:53.115 --> 01:05:55.785
Not one couple in a century
has that chance,

1022
01:05:55.868 --> 01:05:57.536
no matter what
the storybooks say.

1023
01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:01.082
And so,
I think no man in a century

1024
01:06:01.165 --> 01:06:03.668
will suffer as greatly
as you will.

1025
01:06:06.712 --> 01:06:08.005
Not to 50!

1026
01:06:08.089 --> 01:06:10.341
[yelling]

1027
01:06:20.351 --> 01:06:21.811
[yelling]

1028
01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:32.113
Fezzik. Fezzik, listen.

1029
01:06:32.863 --> 01:06:33.823
Do you hear?

1030
01:06:33.906 --> 01:06:36.826
That is the sound
of ultimate suffering.

1031
01:06:36.909 --> 01:06:40.162
My heart made that sound
when Rugen slaughtered my father.

1032
01:06:40.246 --> 01:06:41.831
The man in black
makes it now.

1033
01:06:41.914 --> 01:06:43.124
The man in black?

1034
01:06:43.207 --> 01:06:45.001
His true love is marrying
another tonight,

1035
01:06:45.084 --> 01:06:47.503
so who else has the cause
for ultimate suffering?

1036
01:06:47.586 --> 01:06:51.007
Excuse me. Pardon me, it's important.
Fezzik, please.

1037
01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:53.551
[shouting] Everybody, move!

1038
01:06:54.552 --> 01:06:55.886
Thank you.

1039
01:07:03.894 --> 01:07:05.730
[Inigo]
Where is the man in black?

1040
01:07:06.647 --> 01:07:08.441
You get there
from this grove, yes?

1041
01:07:10.276 --> 01:07:12.862
Fezzik, jog his memory.

1042
01:07:18.409 --> 01:07:21.037
I'm sorry, Inigo.
I didn't mean to jog him so hard.

1043
01:07:22.413 --> 01:07:24.123
Inigo?

1044
01:07:25.207 --> 01:07:29.295
Father, I have failed you
for 20 years.

1045
01:07:30.212 --> 01:07:32.882
Now, our misery can end.

1046
01:07:32.965 --> 01:07:35.009
Somewhere...

1047
01:07:35.092 --> 01:07:37.636
Somewhere close by
is a man who can help us.

1048
01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:43.517
I cannot find him alone.
I need you.

1049
01:07:45.519 --> 01:07:48.314
I need you to guide my sword.

1050
01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:50.107
Please.

1051
01:07:52.109 --> 01:07:53.903
Guide my sword.

1052
01:08:44.411 --> 01:08:45.955
He's dead.

1053
01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:48.249
Just is not fair.

1054
01:08:48.332 --> 01:08:51.127
Grandpa, Grandpa,
wait. Wait.

1055
01:08:51.836 --> 01:08:54.046
What did Fezzik mean,
"He's dead"?

1056
01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:56.799
I mean, he didn't mean "dead."

1057
01:08:58.050 --> 01:09:00.678
Westley's only faking, right?

1058
01:09:01.929 --> 01:09:03.806
You want me
to read this or not?

1059
01:09:04.723 --> 01:09:06.142
Who gets Humperdinck?

1060
01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:08.060
I don't understand.

1061
01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:10.396
Who kills Prince Humperdinck?

1062
01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:12.815
At the end?
Somebody's gotta do it.

1063
01:09:12.898 --> 01:09:14.441
Is it Inigo? Who?

1064
01:09:14.525 --> 01:09:17.361
Nobody. Nobody kills him.

1065
01:09:17.444 --> 01:09:18.946
He lives.

1066
01:09:19.029 --> 01:09:20.823
You mean, he wins?

1067
01:09:20.906 --> 01:09:23.742
Jesus, Grandpa,
what did you read me this thing for?

1068
01:09:24.743 --> 01:09:26.453
You know,
you've been very sick

1069
01:09:26.537 --> 01:09:28.497
and you're taking this story
very seriously.

1070
01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:30.624
I think we ought to
stop now.

1071
01:09:31.709 --> 01:09:34.211
No, I'm okay. I'm okay.

1072
01:09:34.295 --> 01:09:36.672
Sit down. I'm all right.

1073
01:09:38.132 --> 01:09:39.216
Okay.

1074
01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:41.844
All right, now, let's see.
Where were we?

1075
01:09:41.927 --> 01:09:44.180
Oh, yes.

1076
01:09:45.139 --> 01:09:46.974
In the Pit of Despair.

1077
01:09:49.727 --> 01:09:51.604
Well...

1078
01:09:51.687 --> 01:09:54.190
The Montoyas have
never taken defeat easily.

1079
01:09:54.273 --> 01:09:55.649
Come along, Fezzik.
Bring the body.

1080
01:09:55.733 --> 01:09:57.109
The body?

1081
01:09:57.985 --> 01:09:59.028
Have you any money?

1082
01:09:59.111 --> 01:10:00.362
I have a little.

1083
01:10:01.071 --> 01:10:03.782
I just hope it's enough
to buy a miracle, that's all.

1084
01:10:06.911 --> 01:10:08.621
[knocking on door]

1085
01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:09.830
[Miracle Max] Go away!

1086
01:10:13.792 --> 01:10:14.919
What? What?

1087
01:10:15.002 --> 01:10:17.838
Are you the Miracle Max who worked
for the King all those years?

1088
01:10:17.922 --> 01:10:20.007
The King's
stinking son fired me,

1089
01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:22.801
and thank you so much
for bringing up such a painful subject.

1090
01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:24.929
While you're at it,
why don't you give me a nice paper cut

1091
01:10:25.012 --> 01:10:25.971
and pour lemon juice on it?

1092
01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:27.181
We're closed!

1093
01:10:31.393 --> 01:10:32.770
Beat it, or I'll call
the Brute Squad.

1094
01:10:32.853 --> 01:10:34.188
I'm on the Brute Squad.

1095
01:10:34.271 --> 01:10:35.898
You are the Brute Squad.

1096
01:10:35.981 --> 01:10:38.234
We need a miracle.
It's very important.

1097
01:10:38.317 --> 01:10:40.527
Look, I'm retired.
And besides,

1098
01:10:40.611 --> 01:10:43.197
why would you want someone
the King's stinking son fired?

1099
01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:45.157
I might kill whoever
you wanted me to miracle.

1100
01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:46.659
He's already dead.

1101
01:10:47.284 --> 01:10:50.037
He is, huh? I'll take a look.
Bring him in.

1102
01:11:04.635 --> 01:11:06.303
I've seen worse.

1103
01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:13.352
Sir?

1104
01:11:14.436 --> 01:11:15.896
-Sir?
-Huh?

1105
01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:17.606
We're in a terrible rush.

1106
01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:19.024
Don't rush me, sonny.

1107
01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:21.568
You rush a miracle man,
you get rotten miracles.

1108
01:11:21.652 --> 01:11:22.820
You got money?

1109
01:11:22.903 --> 01:11:24.196
Sixty-five.

1110
01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.907
[scoffing]
I never worked for so little,

1111
01:11:26.991 --> 01:11:29.118
except once, and that was
a very noble cause.

1112
01:11:29.827 --> 01:11:31.620
This is noble, sir.

1113
01:11:32.788 --> 01:11:34.999
His wife is crippled.

1114
01:11:35.624 --> 01:11:38.419
His children are
on the brink of starvation.

1115
01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:40.713
Are you a rotten liar.

1116
01:11:41.213 --> 01:11:44.717
I need him to help avenge my father,
murdered these 20 years.

1117
01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:47.803
Your first story was better.
Where's that bellows cranny?

1118
01:11:47.886 --> 01:11:50.889
He probably owes you money, huh?
Well, I'll ask him.

1119
01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:52.558
He's dead. He can't talk.

1120
01:11:52.641 --> 01:11:54.268
[scatting]

1121
01:11:54.351 --> 01:11:56.061
Look who knows so much, huh.

1122
01:11:56.145 --> 01:12:00.316
Well, it just so happens that
your friend here is only mostly dead.

1123
01:12:00.399 --> 01:12:03.694
There's a big difference
between mostly dead and all dead.

1124
01:12:03.777 --> 01:12:05.070
Please, open his mouth.

1125
01:12:06.739 --> 01:12:10.909
Now, mostly dead
is slightly alive.

1126
01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:14.079
Now, all dead...
Well, with all dead,

1127
01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:15.831
there's usually only one thing
that you can do.

1128
01:12:15.914 --> 01:12:17.291
What's that?

1129
01:12:17.374 --> 01:12:19.293
Go through his clothes
and look for loose change.

1130
01:12:25.507 --> 01:12:26.800
Hey!

1131
01:12:26.884 --> 01:12:29.470
Hello in there! Hey!

1132
01:12:29.553 --> 01:12:31.305
What's so important?

1133
01:12:31.388 --> 01:12:34.183
What you got here
that's worth living for?

1134
01:12:38.479 --> 01:12:39.980
True

1135
01:12:40.064 --> 01:12:41.857
love.

1136
01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:43.317
True love. You heard him.

1137
01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:45.194
You could not ask for
a more noble cause than that.

1138
01:12:45.778 --> 01:12:49.990
Sonny, true love is the greatest thing
in the world,

1139
01:12:50.074 --> 01:12:51.367
except for a nice M.L.T.

1140
01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:52.868
A mutton, lettuce
and tomato sandwich

1141
01:12:52.951 --> 01:12:54.620
when the mutton
is nice and lean

1142
01:12:54.703 --> 01:12:56.246
and the tomato is ripe.

1143
01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:58.457
[smacking lips]
They're so perky. I love that.

1144
01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:02.419
But that's not what he said.
He distinctly said, "To blave."

1145
01:13:02.503 --> 01:13:05.589
And as we all know,
"to blave" means "to bluff." Huh?

1146
01:13:05.672 --> 01:13:07.216
So you're probably playing cards
and he cheated...

1147
01:13:07.299 --> 01:13:09.551
Liar! Liar!

1148
01:13:09.635 --> 01:13:10.552
Liar!

1149
01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:12.054
Get back, witch!

1150
01:13:12.137 --> 01:13:13.180
I'm not a witch, I'm your wife!

1151
01:13:13.263 --> 01:13:14.932
But after what you just said,

1152
01:13:15.015 --> 01:13:16.975
I'm not even sure
I want to be that anymore.

1153
01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:18.268
You never had it so good.

1154
01:13:18.352 --> 01:13:20.312
"True love."
He said "true love," Max.

1155
01:13:20.396 --> 01:13:21.897
Don't say another word,
Valerie.

1156
01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:24.441
He's afraid. Ever since
Prince Humperdinck fired him,

1157
01:13:24.525 --> 01:13:25.984
his confidence is shattered.

1158
01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:26.902
Why'd you say that name?

1159
01:13:26.985 --> 01:13:28.946
You promised me that
you would never say that name!

1160
01:13:29.029 --> 01:13:29.947
What, Humperdinck?

1161
01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:32.783
-[shouting]
-Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Humperdinck.

1162
01:13:32.866 --> 01:13:34.993
Humperdinck! Humperdinck!

1163
01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:36.495
I'm not listening!

1164
01:13:36.578 --> 01:13:38.330
-True love lies expiring...
-[shuddering]

1165
01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:41.041
...and you don't have the decency
to say why you won't help.

1166
01:13:41.125 --> 01:13:42.334
Nobody's hearing nothing.

1167
01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:43.752
Humperdinck! Humperdinck!

1168
01:13:43.836 --> 01:13:45.129
[Inigo]
This is Buttercup's true love.

1169
01:13:45.212 --> 01:13:47.923
If you heal him, he will
stop Humperdinck's wedding.

1170
01:13:48.006 --> 01:13:49.007
Humperdinck!

1171
01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:50.217
Wait, wait.

1172
01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:52.010
I make him better,
Humperdinck suffers?

1173
01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:54.555
Humiliations galore.

1174
01:13:55.472 --> 01:13:56.974
[laughing]

1175
01:13:57.057 --> 01:13:58.851
[vocalizing]

1176
01:13:58.934 --> 01:14:01.854
That is a noble cause.
Give me the 65. I'm on the job.

1177
01:14:01.937 --> 01:14:02.813
[exclaims]

1178
01:14:06.567 --> 01:14:08.318
That's a miracle pill?

1179
01:14:08.402 --> 01:14:11.155
The chocolate coating
makes it go down easier.

1180
01:14:11.238 --> 01:14:14.450
But you have to wait
15 minutes for full potency.

1181
01:14:14.533 --> 01:14:17.578
And you shouldn't go in swimming after
for at least... What?

1182
01:14:17.661 --> 01:14:19.329
-An hour. A good hour.
-Yeah, an hour.

1183
01:14:19.413 --> 01:14:20.956
Thank you for everything.

1184
01:14:21.039 --> 01:14:21.874
Okay.

1185
01:14:22.541 --> 01:14:24.084
Bye-bye, boys.

1186
01:14:24.168 --> 01:14:26.044
Have fun
storming the castle.

1187
01:14:26.128 --> 01:14:27.129
Think it'll work?

1188
01:14:27.212 --> 01:14:28.255
It would
take a miracle.

1189
01:14:28.338 --> 01:14:29.965
-Bye-bye!
-Bye!

1190
01:14:30.048 --> 01:14:31.550
[sheep bleating]

1191
01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:37.389
[grunting]

1192
01:14:42.603 --> 01:14:45.189
Inigo, there's more than 30.

1193
01:14:45.272 --> 01:14:47.566
What's the difference?

1194
01:14:47.649 --> 01:14:50.903
We've got him. Help me here.

1195
01:14:51.945 --> 01:14:53.405
We'll have to force-feed him.

1196
01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:54.698
Has it been 15 minutes?

1197
01:14:54.781 --> 01:14:55.991
We can't wait.

1198
01:14:56.074 --> 01:14:57.868
The wedding's in half an hour.

1199
01:14:57.951 --> 01:14:59.620
We must strike in the hustle
and the bustle beforehand.

1200
01:14:59.703 --> 01:15:01.371
Tilt his head back.

1201
01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:03.874
Open his mouth.

1202
01:15:08.504 --> 01:15:11.548
How long do we have to wait
before if we know if the miracle works?

1203
01:15:11.632 --> 01:15:13.300
Your guess is as good as mine.

1204
01:15:13.383 --> 01:15:15.719
I'll beat you at your part.
I'll take you both together!

1205
01:15:15.802 --> 01:15:17.638
I guess not very long.

1206
01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:20.766
Why won't my arms move?

1207
01:15:20.849 --> 01:15:22.643
You've been
mostly dead all day.

1208
01:15:22.726 --> 01:15:26.480
We had Miracle Max
make a pill to bring you back.

1209
01:15:26.563 --> 01:15:29.608
Who are you?
Are we enemies?

1210
01:15:29.691 --> 01:15:32.611
Why am I on this wall?
Where is Buttercup?

1211
01:15:32.694 --> 01:15:34.196
Let me explain.

1212
01:15:34.279 --> 01:15:36.615
No, there is too much.
Let me sum up.

1213
01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:39.243
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck
in a little less than half an hour,

1214
01:15:39.326 --> 01:15:41.453
so all we have to do is
get in, break up the wedding,

1215
01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:45.123
steal the princess, make our escape.
After I kill Count Rugen.

1216
01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:47.626
That doesn't leave much time
for dilly-dallying.

1217
01:15:47.709 --> 01:15:50.963
You just wiggled your finger.
That's wonderful.

1218
01:15:51.046 --> 01:15:54.132
I've always been a quick healer.
What are our liabilities?

1219
01:15:54.216 --> 01:15:57.261
There is but one working castle gate.
Come on.

1220
01:16:00.597 --> 01:16:03.433
And it is guarded by 60 men.

1221
01:16:03.517 --> 01:16:04.560
And our assets?

1222
01:16:04.643 --> 01:16:07.938
Your brains,
Fezzik's strength, my steel.

1223
01:16:08.021 --> 01:16:10.065
That's it? Impossible.

1224
01:16:11.024 --> 01:16:12.025
If I had a month to plan,

1225
01:16:12.109 --> 01:16:14.611
maybe I could come up
with something, but this...

1226
01:16:14.695 --> 01:16:17.781
You just shook your head.
That doesn't make you happy?

1227
01:16:21.285 --> 01:16:25.706
My brains, his steel
and your strength against 60 men,

1228
01:16:25.789 --> 01:16:28.917
and you think a little head jiggle
is supposed to make me happy? Hmm?

1229
01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:32.879
If we only had a wheelbarrow,
that would be something.

1230
01:16:34.089 --> 01:16:36.341
Where did we put the wheelbarrow
the albino had?

1231
01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:37.968
Over the albino, I think.

1232
01:16:38.802 --> 01:16:41.680
Why didn't you list that
among our assets in the first place?

1233
01:16:42.764 --> 01:16:44.141
[sighing]

1234
01:16:44.224 --> 01:16:46.018
What I wouldn't give
for a holocaust cloak.

1235
01:16:46.101 --> 01:16:47.644
There, we cannot help you.

1236
01:16:48.979 --> 01:16:50.272
Will this do?

1237
01:16:50.355 --> 01:16:52.816
-Where did you get that?
-At Miracle Max's.

1238
01:16:52.899 --> 01:16:55.068
It fit so nice,
he said I could keep it.

1239
01:16:55.152 --> 01:16:57.154
All right, all right.
Come on. Help me up.

1240
01:17:00.073 --> 01:17:02.117
-Now, I'll need a sword, eventually.
-Why?

1241
01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:03.493
You can't even lift one.

1242
01:17:03.577 --> 01:17:05.996
True, but that's hardly
common knowledge, is it?

1243
01:17:06.079 --> 01:17:10.250
Thank you. Now, there may be problems
once we're inside.

1244
01:17:10.334 --> 01:17:12.919
I'll say.
How do I find the Count?

1245
01:17:13.003 --> 01:17:14.379
Once I do,
how do I find you again?

1246
01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:15.756
Once I find you again,
how do we escape?

1247
01:17:15.839 --> 01:17:18.842
Don't pester him.
He's had a hard day.

1248
01:17:18.925 --> 01:17:21.553
Right. Right. Sorry.

1249
01:17:25.724 --> 01:17:27.434
-Inigo.
-What?

1250
01:17:27.517 --> 01:17:29.311
I hope we win.

1251
01:17:30.270 --> 01:17:32.481
[Humperdinck]
You don't seem excited, my little muffit.

1252
01:17:33.273 --> 01:17:34.399
Should I be?

1253
01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:37.152
Brides often are, I'm told.

1254
01:17:37.235 --> 01:17:39.279
I do not marry tonight.

1255
01:17:40.530 --> 01:17:41.823
My Westley will save me.

[organ playing]

1259

[garbling] Marriage.

1260
01:18:37.045 --> 01:18:40.757
Marriage is what
brings us together

1261
01:18:40.841 --> 01:18:42.843
today.

1262
01:18:42.926 --> 01:18:46.513
Marriage,
that blessed arrangement,

1263
01:18:47.347 --> 01:18:48.974
that dream

1264
01:18:49.057 --> 01:18:51.309
within a dream.

1265
01:18:51.768 --> 01:18:54.813
[Yellin] Stand your ground, men!
Stand your ground!

[Yellin] Stand your ground!

I am the Dread Pirate Roberts!

[men exclaiming]

1270
01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:11.121
There will be no survivors!

1271

-Now?
-Not yet.

1272
01:19:13.123 --> 01:19:16.835
My men are here, I am here,

1273
01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:21.298
but soon you will not be here.

1274
01:19:21.923 --> 01:19:23.550
-Now!
-Light him.

1275
01:19:26.386 --> 01:19:28.889
The Dread Pirate Roberts

1276
01:19:28.972 --> 01:19:32.017
takes no survivors.

1277
01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:34.186
All your worst nightmares

1278
01:19:34.269 --> 01:19:36.938
are about to come true!

1279
01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:39.441
Then love,

1280
01:19:39.524 --> 01:19:41.943
true love,

1281
01:19:42.027 --> 01:19:44.696
will follow you

1282
01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:46.782
forever.

1283
01:19:46.865 --> 01:19:49.534
The Dread Pirate Roberts

[all clamoring]

[Yellin] Stay where you are.
Stand and fight.

1287

Stay where you are!

1288
01:20:05.342 --> 01:20:07.844
So treasure your love...

1289
01:20:07.928 --> 01:20:09.638
Skip to the end.

1290
01:20:09.721 --> 01:20:11.389
Have you the ring?

[rumbling]

1292
01:20:13.892 --> 01:20:15.310
Here comes my Westley now.

1293
01:20:15.393 --> 01:20:17.604
Fezzik, the portcullis!

1294

[grunting]

1295
01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:25.737
Your Westley is dead.

1296
01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:26.947
I killed him myself.

1297
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:29.241
Then why is there fear
behind your eyes?

1298
01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:35.539
Give us the gate key.

1299
01:20:35.622 --> 01:20:37.624
I have no gate key.

1300
01:20:37.707 --> 01:20:40.293
Fezzik, tear his arms off.

1301
01:20:40.377 --> 01:20:42.087
Oh, you mean this gate key.

1302
01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:46.299
And do you,
Princess Buttercup...

1303
01:20:46.383 --> 01:20:49.302
Man and wife!
Say, "Man and wife!"

1304
01:20:49.386 --> 01:20:51.304
Man and wife.

1305
01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:54.224
Escort the bride
to the honeymoon suite.

1306
01:20:54.307 --> 01:20:55.433
I'll be there shortly.

1307
01:20:57.644 --> 01:20:59.145
He didn't come.

1308
01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:36.099
Kill the dark one
and the giant,

1309
01:21:36.182 --> 01:21:38.268
but leave the third
for questioning.

[soldiers grunting]

1311
01:21:49.779 --> 01:21:53.199
Hello.
My name is Inigo Montoya.

1312
01:21:54.534 --> 01:21:58.121
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.

1313
01:22:22.562 --> 01:22:25.440
Fezzik! I need you!

1314
01:22:25.523 --> 01:22:27.108
I can't leave him alone.

1315
01:22:27.192 --> 01:22:29.945
He's getting away from me,
Fezzik! Please!

1316

Fezzik!

1317
01:22:36.284 --> 01:22:37.577
I'll be right back.

1319
01:22:45.710 --> 01:22:47.170
Thank you.

1320
01:22:48.421 --> 01:22:49.965
Strange wedding.

1321
01:22:50.048 --> 01:22:52.509
Yes, a very strange wedding.

1322
01:22:53.885 --> 01:22:55.261
Come along.

1323
01:23:01.351 --> 01:23:02.686
What was that for?

1324
01:23:02.769 --> 01:23:05.105
Because you've always been
so kind to me.

1325
01:23:05.188 --> 01:23:07.148
And I won't be
seeing you again,

1326
01:23:07.232 --> 01:23:10.151
since I'm killing myself
once we reach the honeymoon suite.

1327
01:23:10.902 --> 01:23:12.237
Won't that be nice?

1328
01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:14.990
She kissed me! [laughing]

1329

Sorry, Father.

01:24:04.414 --> 01:24:05.874
I tried.

1333
01:24:06.916 --> 01:24:07.959
I tried.

1334
01:24:09.669 --> 01:24:11.838
You must be
that little Spanish brat

1335
01:24:11.921 --> 01:24:14.883
I taught a lesson to
all those years ago.

1336
01:24:15.341 --> 01:24:16.843
Simply incredible.

1337
01:24:17.761 --> 01:24:21.097
Have you been chasing me your whole life,
only to fail now?

1338
01:24:21.681 --> 01:24:24.684
I think that's the worst thing
I've ever heard.

1339
01:24:26.019 --> 01:24:27.312
How marvelous.

to damage yours.

why won't you hold me?

At a time like this?

think to say? "Gently"?

sense of vengeance.

into trouble someday.

[Tyrone grunts]

01:27:22.987 --> 01:27:25.240
Westley,
will you ever forgive me?

1375
01:27:25.323 --> 01:27:27.492
What hideous sin
have you committed lately?

1376
01:27:27.575 --> 01:27:31.287
I got married. I didn't want to.
It all happened so fast.

1377
01:27:31.371 --> 01:27:33.122
-It never happened.
-What?

1378
01:27:33.206 --> 01:27:34.249
It never happened.

1379
01:27:34.332 --> 01:27:35.625
But it did. I was there.

1380
01:27:35.708 --> 01:27:37.001
This old man said,
"Man and wife."

1381
01:27:37.085 --> 01:27:38.628
Did you say, "I do"?

1382
01:27:40.004 --> 01:27:42.590
No. We sort of
skipped that part.

1383
01:27:42.674 --> 01:27:44.968
Then you're not married.

1384
01:27:45.051 --> 01:27:46.970
If you didn't say it,
you didn't do it.

1385
01:27:48.721 --> 01:27:50.556
Wouldn't you agree,
Your Highness?

1386
01:27:51.808 --> 01:27:54.936
A technicality that will
shortly be remedied.

1387
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:57.897
But first things first.

1388
01:28:00.858 --> 01:28:02.610
-To the death.
-[Westley] No!

1389
01:28:03.027 --> 01:28:04.112
To the pain.

1390
01:28:06.447 --> 01:28:08.366
I don't think I'm quite familiar
with that phrase.

1391
01:28:08.449 --> 01:28:09.575
I'll explain.

1392
01:28:09.659 --> 01:28:12.912
And I'll use small words,
so that you'll be sure to understand,

1393
01:28:12.996 --> 01:28:15.623
you warthog-faced buffoon.

1394
01:28:17.083 --> 01:28:22.005
That may be the first time in my life
a man has dared insult me.

1395
01:28:22.213 --> 01:28:24.590
It won't be the last.

1396
01:28:24.674 --> 01:28:26.217
"To the pain" means
the first thing you lose

1397
01:28:26.301 --> 01:28:27.719
will be your feet,
below the ankles.

1398
01:28:28.553 --> 01:28:32.473
Then your hands at the wrists.
Next, your nose.

1399
01:28:32.557 --> 01:28:36.686
And then my tongue, I suppose?
I killed you too quickly the last time,

1400
01:28:36.769 --> 01:28:39.480
a mistake I don't mean
to duplicate tonight.

1401
01:28:39.564 --> 01:28:40.857
I wasn't finished!

1402
01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:43.818
The next thing you lose will be
your left eye, followed by your right.

1403
01:28:43.901 --> 01:28:47.155
And then my ears. I understand.
Let's get on with it.

1404
01:28:47.238 --> 01:28:50.575
Wrong! Your ears you keep,
and I'll tell you why.

1405
01:28:52.618 --> 01:28:55.913
So that every shriek of every child
at seeing your hideousness

1406
01:28:55.997 --> 01:28:57.790
will be yours to cherish.

1407
01:28:58.666 --> 01:29:00.793
Every babe that weeps
at your approach,

1408
01:29:00.877 --> 01:29:03.755
every woman who cries out,
"Dear, God, what is that thing?"

1409
01:29:03.838 --> 01:29:06.466
will echo in your perfect ears.

1410
01:29:07.675 --> 01:29:09.844
That is what "to the pain" means.

1411
01:29:09.927 --> 01:29:12.138
It means I leave you in anguish,

1412
01:29:12.221 --> 01:29:15.433
wallowing in freakish misery forever.

1413
01:29:18.144 --> 01:29:19.520
I think you're bluffing.

1414
01:29:19.604 --> 01:29:21.689
It's possible, pig.

1415
01:29:21.773 --> 01:29:23.149
I might be bluffing.

1416
01:29:23.691 --> 01:29:26.694
It's conceivable,
you miserable, vomitous mass,

1417
01:29:26.778 --> 01:29:29.572
that I'm only lying here
because I lack the strength to stand.

1418
01:29:31.115 --> 01:29:32.575
Then again...

1419
01:29:34.118 --> 01:29:36.120
perhaps I have
the strength after all.

1420
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:55.973
Drop your sword.

1421
01:29:58.518 --> 01:29:59.769
[sword drops]

1422
01:30:00.478 --> 01:30:01.521
Have a seat.

1423
01:30:06.317 --> 01:30:07.777
Tie him up.

1424
01:30:09.278 --> 01:30:11.280
Make it as tight
as you like.

1425
01:30:11.364 --> 01:30:12.490
[Humperdinck] Oh.

1426
01:30:15.827 --> 01:30:17.161
Where's Fezzik?

1427
01:30:17.245 --> 01:30:19.288
-I thought he was with you.
-No.

1428
01:30:19.372 --> 01:30:20.748
In that case...

1429
01:30:21.624 --> 01:30:22.667
Help him.

1430
01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:24.001
Why does Westley
need helping?

1431
01:30:24.752 --> 01:30:26.295
[Inigo] Because he has
no strength.

1432
01:30:26.379 --> 01:30:28.881
I knew it. I knew you were bluffing!
I knew he was bluffing.

1433
01:30:28.965 --> 01:30:30.842
Shall I dispatch him
for you?

1434
01:30:30.925 --> 01:30:32.760
Thank you, but no.
Whatever happens to us,

1435
01:30:32.844 --> 01:30:35.138
I want him to live a long life,
alone with his cowardice.

1436
01:30:36.097 --> 01:30:37.723
[Fezzik] Inigo!

1437
01:30:37.807 --> 01:30:40.309
Inigo, where are you?

1438
01:30:41.686 --> 01:30:43.813
Oh, there you are.

1439
01:30:43.896 --> 01:30:46.524
Inigo, I saw
the prince's stables.

1440
01:30:46.607 --> 01:30:49.569
And there they were.
Four white horses.

1441
01:30:49.652 --> 01:30:54.157
And I thought, "There are four of us,
if we ever find the lady."

1442
01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:55.366
Hello, lady.

1443
01:30:57.118 --> 01:31:00.246
So I took them with me,
in case we ever bumped into each other.

1444
01:31:00.329 --> 01:31:02.540
I guess we just did.

1445
01:31:03.124 --> 01:31:05.960
Fezzik, you did
something right.

1446
01:31:06.043 --> 01:31:09.046
Don't worry,
I won't let it go to my head.

1447
01:31:28.482 --> 01:31:31.611
You know,
it's very strange.

1448
01:31:32.570 --> 01:31:35.489
I have been in
the revenge business so long,

1449
01:31:35.573 --> 01:31:37.617
now that it's over,

1450
01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:39.785
I don't know what to do
with the rest of my life.

1451
01:31:41.329 --> 01:31:43.497
Have you ever
considered piracy?

1452
01:31:43.581 --> 01:31:45.374
You'd make a wonderful
Dread Pirate Roberts.

1453
01:31:53.007 --> 01:31:54.383
[horses neigh]

1454
01:31:58.262 --> 01:32:00.514
[grandfather]
"They rode to freedom.

1455
01:32:00.598 --> 01:32:04.393
And as dawn arose,
Westley and Buttercup knew they were safe.

1456
01:32:04.477 --> 01:32:06.938
A wave of love
swept over them,

1457
01:32:07.021 --> 01:32:08.856
and as they reached
for each other..."

1458
01:32:12.485 --> 01:32:13.694
What? What?

1459
01:32:13.778 --> 01:32:16.197
No, it's kissing again.
You don't want to hear that.

1460
01:32:18.074 --> 01:32:19.659
I... I don't mind so much.

1461
01:32:21.661 --> 01:32:22.870
Okay.

1462
01:32:24.997 --> 01:32:28.459
"Since the invention of the kiss,
there have been five kisses

1463
01:32:28.542 --> 01:32:31.963
that were rated the most passionate,
the most pure.

1464
01:32:32.046 --> 01:32:34.048
This one left them all behind.

1465
01:32:39.345 --> 01:32:40.638
The end."

1466
01:32:43.641 --> 01:32:45.977
Now, I think
you ought to go to sleep.

1467
01:32:46.769 --> 01:32:47.770
Okay.

1468
01:32:50.231 --> 01:32:51.524
[grandfather] Okay.

1469
01:32:52.608 --> 01:32:53.985
Okay.

1470
01:32:56.696 --> 01:32:58.030
Okay.

1471
01:32:58.906 --> 01:33:00.408
All right.

1472
01:33:03.411 --> 01:33:04.829
So long.

1473
01:33:06.539 --> 01:33:08.040
Grandpa?

1474
01:33:11.335 --> 01:33:14.964
Maybe you could come over
and read it again to me tomorrow.

1475
01:33:17.425 --> 01:33:19.343
As you wish.
