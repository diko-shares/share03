00:00:02,563 --> 00:00:03,890
Hey. Thanks for swinging by.

2
00:00:03,914 --> 00:00:05,682
Ye-ah, no sweat. We were doing
a prep at 26th and Cal.

3
00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:06,683
What's going on?

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,784
There's been a rash of ODs.

5
00:00:07,818 --> 00:00:08,785
They're coming in in waves.

6
00:00:08,819 --> 00:00:10,353
Third one today just coded.

7
00:00:10,421 --> 00:00:12,522
- Heroin?
- Yeah, but definitely laced.

8
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:13,990
Probably fentanyl.

9
00:00:14,024 --> 00:00:16,492
I haven't seen anything
like this since...

10
00:00:16,527 --> 00:00:17,627
ever.

11
00:00:17,661 --> 00:00:18,628
I'll put a call in to Narcotics...

12
00:00:18,662 --> 00:00:19,796
see what they know.

13
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,997
Can we get the CFD paperwork?

14
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:22,332
I want to see where
these paramedic calls

15
00:00:22,366 --> 00:00:23,499
are originating from.

16
00:00:23,534 --> 00:00:25,468
They're coming in from
all over the city.

17
00:00:25,502 --> 00:00:27,470
I've got another one.
Narcan's wearing off.

18
00:00:27,504 --> 00:00:30,340
Give him another 2 of Narcan...
slow IV push.

19
00:00:31,942 --> 00:00:33,309
All right, I'll pull together
a detailed list when I can.

20
00:00:33,344 --> 00:00:34,377
- I got to go.
- Thanks, man,

21
00:00:34,445 --> 00:00:35,645
Thanks.

22
00:00:37,815 --> 00:00:40,116
Oh, man.

23
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,985
We got to roll.

24
00:00:46,523 --> 00:00:47,490
What do we got?

25
00:00:47,524 --> 00:00:48,958
A call came in.

26
00:00:48,993 --> 00:00:51,494
Suspicious package by the lake.

27
00:00:51,528 --> 00:00:53,997
Family was setting up for
their kid's birthday party.

28
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:56,899
Roger and Ashley Basinski over here.

29
00:00:56,967 --> 00:00:58,635
The mother found a backpack

30
00:00:58,669 --> 00:01:00,403
soaked in what she believed to be blood.

31
00:01:00,471 --> 00:01:01,638
Recovered right over here.

32
00:01:01,672 --> 00:01:03,339
She open it?

33
00:01:03,374 --> 00:01:05,541
Yeah, found a surprise inside.

34
00:01:05,576 --> 00:01:07,143
- You want to talk to 'em?
- Yeah.

35
00:01:07,177 --> 00:01:08,311
All right.

36
00:01:08,345 --> 00:01:10,647
All right, guys...

37
00:01:23,894 --> 00:01:24,927
Fentanyl?

38
00:01:26,163 --> 00:01:27,597
300 K worth.

39
00:01:27,665 --> 00:01:29,732
My guy in Narcotics says
recently they've been

40
00:01:29,767 --> 00:01:31,601
pulling heroin off the streets
that's been cut with it.

41
00:01:31,669 --> 00:01:33,569
Makes it, like, 1,000 times more potent.

42
00:01:33,604 --> 00:01:35,905
It's killing people all over Chicago.

43
00:01:39,743 --> 00:01:41,511
Hey, Sarge.

44
00:01:41,545 --> 00:01:45,014
I heard Mouse came looking
to get a felony dropped

45
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:48,017
so he could re-enlist.

46
00:01:48,052 --> 00:01:49,585
And if he did?

47
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,121
I think he's carrying
around a lot of guilt

48
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:54,691
that we made it home safe

49
00:01:54,725 --> 00:01:57,460
and friends of ours didn't.

50
00:02:05,736 --> 00:02:07,203
Grab a shoulder. Grab a shoulder.

51
00:02:07,237 --> 00:02:08,738
Are you all right?

52
00:02:08,772 --> 00:02:11,107
Get her out of here; get
her to her parents.

53
00:02:13,777 --> 00:02:15,812
Be careful.

54
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:20,583
- Oh!
- Oh, man.

55
00:02:20,617 --> 00:02:22,752
God.

56
00:02:22,786 --> 00:02:24,220
Oh, my God.

58
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:44,050
Back in '06, we had freezer trucks

59
00:02:44,075 --> 00:02:45,409
parked out back filled with stiffs

60
00:02:45,443 --> 00:02:47,714
from all the heat-related deaths.

61
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:49,740
We actually ran out of toe tags.

62
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:51,175
All of these are from fentanyl?

63
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,045
Last two weeks have been insane.

64
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,746
Dealers get the cut wrong,

65
00:02:55,781 --> 00:02:57,782
your heart stops instantly.

66
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,884
Okay.

67
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:03,621
Cause of death on your DOA
is blunt head trauma.

68
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:06,757
Abrasions on both shoulders

69
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:09,694
match the width of the backpack
recovered at the scene.

70
00:03:09,728 --> 00:03:10,928
You find any drugs in his system?

71
00:03:10,963 --> 00:03:13,030
Toxicology report came back clean.

72
00:03:13,065 --> 00:03:15,032
But you may be able to run with this.

73
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:17,468
His skin was bloated from
the time in the water...

74
00:03:17,536 --> 00:03:19,570
ballparking at seven hours.

75
00:03:19,605 --> 00:03:21,706
Clear as day now that he's dried out.

76
00:03:27,145 --> 00:03:28,479
So how's the online dating going?

77
00:03:28,547 --> 00:03:29,747
Oh, my God, shush.

78
00:03:29,781 --> 00:03:30,982
Okay, sorry.

79
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:32,550
Can I talk to you guys?

80
00:03:32,584 --> 00:03:33,618
Oh, God, is that her, uh...

81
00:03:33,652 --> 00:03:34,952
Yeah, it's her bad news voice.

82
00:03:39,758 --> 00:03:43,494
Julie, there's no easy way to say this.

83
00:03:43,562 --> 00:03:45,596
You're being transferred
back to your foot beat

84
00:03:45,631 --> 00:03:46,931
at 26th and Cal.

85
00:03:46,965 --> 00:03:48,766
What the hell? She just got here.

86
00:03:51,236 --> 00:03:53,104
It's Fogel.

87
00:03:53,138 --> 00:03:55,606
Because she didn't consent
to being his piece of ass?

88
00:03:55,641 --> 00:03:56,774
I am well aware of the particulars...

89
00:03:56,808 --> 00:03:58,609
- I mean, you got to be...
- Burgess!

90
00:04:02,514 --> 00:04:05,516
I brought you in at
management discretion.

91
00:04:05,584 --> 00:04:06,764
He went over me.

92
00:04:06,866 --> 00:04:08,700
He went over the union.

93
00:04:08,734 --> 00:04:10,435
He is a commander,

94
00:04:10,503 --> 00:04:13,872
and there is nothing more I can do.

95
00:04:13,906 --> 00:04:15,440
I'm sorry.

96
00:04:15,508 --> 00:04:17,609
This is your last shift at 21.

97
00:04:26,452 --> 00:04:28,453
We'll fight it.

98
00:04:37,263 --> 00:04:39,397
Hey, anything come back on the tattoo?

99
00:04:39,432 --> 00:04:41,633
Yeah, I went through the intake
records at the morgue...

100
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:45,403
checked every death certificate
from April 22, 2010...

101
00:04:45,438 --> 00:04:46,404
by hand.

102
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,405
They're not online.

103
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,573
So that's a no then?

104
00:04:48,607 --> 00:04:50,742
No.

105
00:04:50,776 --> 00:04:52,644
It's Grace Clarendon.

106
00:04:52,712 --> 00:04:54,746
leukemia.

107
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,947
She was 14.

108
00:04:57,883 --> 00:04:59,150
Damn.

109
00:04:59,218 --> 00:05:01,753
LKA for her mother is at
the bottom of the page,

110
00:05:01,787 --> 00:05:03,888
right hand side.

111
00:05:03,923 --> 00:05:05,790
You're welcome.

112
00:05:18,304 --> 00:05:19,504
Theresa Clarendon?

113
00:05:19,572 --> 00:05:20,605
- Yeah.
- I'm Detective Dawson.

114
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,906
This is Detective Olinsky.

115
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:23,174
No, I asked Mr. Harrison

116
00:05:23,242 --> 00:05:24,743
to give me another week
to put the rent together.

117
00:05:24,777 --> 00:05:26,010
Please don't throw me out.

118
00:05:26,078 --> 00:05:29,781
Uh, we're, uh... we're
here about your son.

119
00:05:29,815 --> 00:05:33,017
Why? What happened to him?

120
00:05:33,085 --> 00:05:34,786
Ma'am, I'm gonna show you a photo.

121
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:42,327
That's his tattoo.

122
00:05:45,998 --> 00:05:48,366
God, is he okay?

123
00:05:48,434 --> 00:05:49,968
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

124
00:06:01,714 --> 00:06:05,350
When we placed Grace to rest,

125
00:06:05,384 --> 00:06:08,653
I just assumed

126
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:10,388
Tyler would be the one

127
00:06:10,456 --> 00:06:12,490
to lay me next to her.

128
00:06:14,126 --> 00:06:15,794
Ms. Clarendon,

129
00:06:15,828 --> 00:06:18,830
is there any chance that
your son might have been

130
00:06:18,864 --> 00:06:20,698
mixed up in something illegal?

131
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:22,734
Like what?

132
00:06:22,802 --> 00:06:25,403
When Tyler was found, he
was wearing a backpack

133
00:06:25,471 --> 00:06:26,871
filled with narcotics.

134
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,676
Tyler had a problem with that

135
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,845
when he got back from overseas.

136
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,880
He was in the military.

137
00:06:35,915 --> 00:06:38,383
He was trying to get his life together.

138
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:39,851
He got a job.

139
00:06:39,885 --> 00:06:41,419
Doing what?

140
00:06:41,487 --> 00:06:43,822
Landscaping, he said.

141
00:06:43,856 --> 00:06:44,856
I don't know the details.

142
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,825
I saw him mostly on Facebook.

143
00:06:46,859 --> 00:06:48,726
He have any recent posts?

144
00:07:08,047 --> 00:07:10,682
This friend... you know him?

145
00:07:12,184 --> 00:07:13,751
<i>Tyler Clarendon.</i>

146
00:07:16,188 --> 00:07:18,857
This woman outlived both her kids.

147
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:21,593
His new best friend was Tony Chin.

148
00:07:21,627 --> 00:07:22,727
20.

149
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:24,028
Junior at Central Chicago U.

150
00:07:24,063 --> 00:07:25,897
No criminal record, but
the last few weeks,

151
00:07:25,931 --> 00:07:28,600
he suddenly appears all over
Tyler's social media profile.

152
00:07:28,634 --> 00:07:30,201
Mouse, you dump his phone records?

153
00:07:30,236 --> 00:07:32,804
Yeah, there's dozens of calls
between Tyler and Tony Chin,

154
00:07:32,872 --> 00:07:34,138
all less than two minutes in duration

155
00:07:34,206 --> 00:07:35,740
and at all sorts of crazy hours.

156
00:07:35,774 --> 00:07:38,042
Have Atwater and Ruzek
take a run at this guy.

157
00:07:38,077 --> 00:07:40,945
You know, uh, Tyler...

158
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,148
he was 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine.

159
00:07:44,216 --> 00:07:45,617
- When?
- '08.

160
00:07:45,651 --> 00:07:48,486
He was spitting distance
from us in Kandahar.

161
00:07:48,554 --> 00:07:50,755
All right, well, they saw some action.

162
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:52,090
Yeah, they did.

163
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,838
What part of "do not disturb"
you having trouble with?

164
00:08:06,906 --> 00:08:08,506
The Chicago PD part.

165
00:08:08,574 --> 00:08:10,008
Hey.

166
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:12,944
Look, I-I... I didn't know.

167
00:08:12,978 --> 00:08:14,112
It's okay. I understand.

168
00:08:14,146 --> 00:08:15,113
We all look alike.

169
00:08:15,147 --> 00:08:16,814
African-Americans?

170
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:17,949
Wha...

171
00:08:17,983 --> 00:08:19,183
Cops...

172
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:21,452
the same cops who heard that

173
00:08:21,487 --> 00:08:23,588
apparently you're the guy to talk to.

174
00:08:23,622 --> 00:08:24,856
About what?

175
00:08:24,924 --> 00:08:27,792
About your buddy Tyler right here.

176
00:08:27,826 --> 00:08:29,494
I met him at a party I DJ'd.

177
00:08:29,528 --> 00:08:30,795
I didn't know him that well.

178
00:08:30,829 --> 00:08:32,030
Really?

179
00:08:32,097 --> 00:08:33,665
Then why you been calling
him day and night?

180
00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:35,633
He did a little work
for me at the parties,

181
00:08:35,668 --> 00:08:38,169
providing refreshments.

182
00:08:38,203 --> 00:08:40,538
Refreshments, huh?

183
00:08:40,606 --> 00:08:41,873
Okay, it's... it's not like that.

184
00:08:41,941 --> 00:08:44,542
- I'm talking beer...
- Tony, please.

185
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,045
Don't act as stupid as that
haircut makes you look.

186
00:08:47,112 --> 00:08:48,947
You guys were running dope together.

187
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:50,982
Right? Tony...

188
00:08:51,016 --> 00:08:52,684
I... I don't know what
you're talking about.

189
00:08:52,718 --> 00:08:54,619
I'm a... I'm a Phi Beta
Kappa honor student,

190
00:08:54,653 --> 00:08:56,287
and I've got a chem
midterm on Friday, so...

191
00:08:56,322 --> 00:08:58,156
Let me guess what happened.

192
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,825
Tyler... he wanted a little
bit bigger cut, right?

193
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:02,627
So you take a baseball bat...

194
00:09:02,661 --> 00:09:03,861
crack him in the head with it.

195
00:09:05,998 --> 00:09:07,665
Damn.

196
00:09:10,903 --> 00:09:14,572
Hey, Officer, do you mind
if I grab my wallet?

197
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,240
I don't want you, you know, shooting me

198
00:09:16,308 --> 00:09:17,842
as I reach for it, so...

199
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,182
Yeah, any more questions,
contact my lawyer.

200
00:09:24,216 --> 00:09:25,817
Wow, you have one on retainer.

201
00:09:25,851 --> 00:09:27,218
Yeah, this conversation's over.

202
00:09:29,588 --> 00:09:31,055
For now.

203
00:09:33,225 --> 00:09:34,859
It's never gonna end with that guy.

204
00:09:34,893 --> 00:09:37,697
There's got to be
something that we can do.

205
00:09:37,722 --> 00:09:39,489
Private security, I guess?

206
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,533
Ride out the year.

207
00:09:42,568 --> 00:09:44,228
Bid back into 21st legit,

208
00:09:44,268 --> 00:09:45,802
and then no one can touch you.

209
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,437
Hey, are you okay?

210
00:09:49,462 --> 00:09:50,629
Did somebody hurt you?

211
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,676
My mom... she hurt my dad real bad.

212
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,244
Call it in. What's your name, buddy?

213
00:09:54,312 --> 00:09:55,579
- Chase.
- 2113, this is an emergency.

214
00:09:55,647 --> 00:09:56,680
Roll another squad to
32nd and Princeton.

215
00:09:56,714 --> 00:09:57,848
You got a last name?

216
00:09:57,882 --> 00:09:58,915
Chase, you're gonna be fine.

217
00:09:58,983 --> 00:10:00,317
- We're gonna help your dad.
- Okay.

218
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:01,518
Hey, look at me. We're gonna help you.

219
00:10:01,552 --> 00:10:03,487
All right?

220
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:05,522
That's my house, the one with the flag.

221
00:10:05,556 --> 00:10:06,890
Chase, can you stay with these officers?

222
00:10:06,924 --> 00:10:08,592
- Yeah?
- Yeah, go in the back.

223
00:10:13,731 --> 00:10:15,399
Hey.

224
00:10:18,436 --> 00:10:19,670
Chicago PD!

225
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,241
Clear.

226
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:25,542
- Clear.
- Sir?

227
00:10:25,576 --> 00:10:27,411
Chicago PD. Don't move.

228
00:10:27,445 --> 00:10:29,713
Got you, Tay. Coming up behind.

229
00:10:29,747 --> 00:10:33,550
- Clear.
- Sir, I need to see your hands.

230
00:10:33,584 --> 00:10:35,552
Sir, do not move your
hands from that table!

231
00:10:35,586 --> 00:10:37,954
Chicago PD!

232
00:10:38,022 --> 00:10:40,390
Help me.

233
00:10:40,425 --> 00:10:41,692
Please.

234
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:43,260
I don't want to die.

235
00:10:44,362 --> 00:10:45,529
Help.

236
00:10:49,538 --> 00:10:50,634
Is he gonna be all right?

237
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:54,128
We'll know more when we get to Med.

238
00:10:54,163 --> 00:10:56,831
Where's your mom?

239
00:10:57,295 --> 00:10:59,396
Hey. Chase?

240
00:10:59,421 --> 00:11:01,589
Can you tell me where your mom is?

241
00:11:01,623 --> 00:11:03,758
I don't know.

242
00:11:03,792 --> 00:11:05,559
It's okay.

243
00:11:05,594 --> 00:11:08,262
Hey, it's okay.

244
00:11:08,296 --> 00:11:10,331
Don't worry.

245
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,301
And that's when your wife got violent?

246
00:11:14,336 --> 00:11:17,671
Yeah, uh, my ex.

247
00:11:19,674 --> 00:11:22,743
We had words. She went nuts.

248
00:11:22,778 --> 00:11:26,313
Stabbed me with a steak knife.

249
00:11:26,348 --> 00:11:28,315
But when she saw the blood,

250
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,184
she panicked and ran out.

251
00:11:33,288 --> 00:11:34,855
She, um...

252
00:11:34,923 --> 00:11:36,690
she ever do anything like this before?

253
00:11:37,793 --> 00:11:39,360
No.

254
00:11:39,427 --> 00:11:40,861
Just a lot of bitching.

255
00:11:42,464 --> 00:11:44,532
But I'll take the knife every time.

256
00:11:45,934 --> 00:11:49,470
And Chase was where for all of this?

257
00:11:49,504 --> 00:11:51,972
Napping.

258
00:11:52,007 --> 00:11:54,675
I couldn't find my phone.

259
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:57,378
So I yelled for him.

260
00:11:57,445 --> 00:12:00,548
He came in.

261
00:12:00,615 --> 00:12:03,684
He was crying.

262
00:12:03,718 --> 00:12:05,886
He hugged me.

263
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:09,890
That's how come he got blood on him.

264
00:12:11,626 --> 00:12:14,228
Then he ran to get help.

265
00:12:14,296 --> 00:12:17,832
There's no other immediate
family in Chicago?

266
00:12:17,866 --> 00:12:19,867
- Outside of his mother?
- Yeah.

267
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:21,969
Uh-uh.

268
00:12:22,003 --> 00:12:24,471
We both moved from St.
John, Indiana, years ago.

269
00:12:26,474 --> 00:12:29,243
All right, well, we put an
investigative alert on her.

270
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:32,379
Chase...

271
00:12:32,414 --> 00:12:35,983
Chase'll have to go with DCFS.

272
00:12:36,017 --> 00:12:37,852
Can you take him?

273
00:12:40,722 --> 00:12:43,891
Please?

274
00:12:43,925 --> 00:12:45,426
Just till I get out of here.

275
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,367
You know what, Jay?

276
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:54,568
It's not your call.

277
00:12:54,603 --> 00:12:57,438
I promised that I would look out for you

278
00:12:57,505 --> 00:12:58,672
when we came home.

279
00:12:58,707 --> 00:13:00,741
That is what I'm doing.

280
00:13:00,775 --> 00:13:02,877
Why are you so insistent
that it has to be right now?

281
00:13:04,713 --> 00:13:05,946
Take a couple months off.

282
00:13:06,014 --> 00:13:07,281
Just clear your head, and then if you...

283
00:13:07,349 --> 00:13:09,783
No, if I wait, the post
will be gone in six months.

284
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:10,918
All right?

285
00:13:10,952 --> 00:13:12,019
If I don't reenlist now, it's done.

286
00:13:12,053 --> 00:13:13,287
Greg, it's a war.

287
00:13:13,355 --> 00:13:14,889
They're not really turning people away.

288
00:13:14,923 --> 00:13:16,891
Do you have any idea what it's like?

289
00:13:16,925 --> 00:13:20,060
I sit behind that desk and watch
you go out every single day...

290
00:13:20,095 --> 00:13:21,762
go out and see action.

291
00:13:21,796 --> 00:13:23,964
Do you have any idea how
that actually makes me feel?

292
00:13:24,032 --> 00:13:25,699
Then take the police exam!

293
00:13:25,734 --> 00:13:27,568
No, I was born to be a soldier!

294
00:13:27,602 --> 00:13:29,703
A soldier, man!

295
00:13:30,972 --> 00:13:32,940
If it comes down to it, I will die one.

296
00:13:32,974 --> 00:13:34,775
Are you crazy?

297
00:13:35,944 --> 00:13:37,544
Sorry to interrupt.

298
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:40,381
Uh, your guy from Narcotics, Martinez...
he called back.

299
00:13:40,415 --> 00:13:42,082
They got a line on the
dealer who changed his cut

300
00:13:42,117 --> 00:13:44,084
from lactose to fentanyl.

301
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:46,320
Thanks.

302
00:14:05,106 --> 00:14:08,442
Black ball cap, black
hoodie, white sneakers.

303
00:14:08,476 --> 00:14:09,743
Heavyset guy?

304
00:14:09,778 --> 00:14:11,111
Yeah, didn't dig the nickname "Chunk,"

305
00:14:11,146 --> 00:14:13,480
so he took a tire iron
to some guy's dome.

306
00:14:13,515 --> 00:14:14,648
Goes by "Red" now.

307
00:14:14,683 --> 00:14:15,816
Quite the entrepreneur.

308
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,418
Been working double shifts...

309
00:14:17,452 --> 00:14:18,752
managing a spot during the day

310
00:14:18,787 --> 00:14:20,421
and handling the cut at night.

311
00:14:20,455 --> 00:14:22,823
Meaning he knows the
source of the supply.

312
00:14:22,857 --> 00:14:23,924
Yup.

313
00:14:26,761 --> 00:14:29,964
Hey, man, I'm looking for two.

314
00:14:29,998 --> 00:14:31,966
Who sent you?

315
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,434
Red, come on, man.

316
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:35,836
I was here like...
like, three weeks ago.

317
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,638
<i>Come on, man. Cash money.</i>

318
00:14:37,672 --> 00:14:39,440
<i>You know I'm good for it.</i>

319
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,615
All right.

320
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,683
We got a positive.

321
00:14:49,718 --> 00:14:50,718
I repeat, we got a positive.

322
00:14:50,785 --> 00:14:52,519
Black hat, black hoodie, white shoes.

323
00:14:56,391 --> 00:14:59,026
Chicago PD. Let me see your hands.

324
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,527
Hey, Red.

325
00:15:00,562 --> 00:15:03,030
- You know who we are.
- Man, I ain't got nothing.

326
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:05,666
Oops.

327
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,568
Mustache on Jackson...

328
00:15:07,635 --> 00:15:08,869
I drew it.

329
00:15:08,903 --> 00:15:10,671
My bills.

330
00:15:17,846 --> 00:15:20,080
Man, I don't know nothing about nothing.

331
00:15:20,148 --> 00:15:23,751
Bro, if it was me,

332
00:15:23,818 --> 00:15:25,019
I'd be a hell of a lot more worried

333
00:15:25,053 --> 00:15:26,887
about these drug-induced homicides.

334
00:15:26,921 --> 00:15:28,188
I don't even know what that is.

335
00:15:28,223 --> 00:15:29,556
Nine bodies so far.

336
00:15:29,591 --> 00:15:31,191
I didn't serve any of those hypes.

337
00:15:31,226 --> 00:15:32,192
It's your dope in 'em.

338
00:15:32,227 --> 00:15:33,827
Might as well be your bullet.

339
00:15:37,832 --> 00:15:39,600
So what you looking for exactly?

340
00:15:41,536 --> 00:15:43,070
You've been inside two years

341
00:15:43,104 --> 00:15:45,906
and been picked up how many times?

342
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,008
Hey.

343
00:15:49,577 --> 00:15:51,178
What do you think we're looking for?

344
00:15:57,085 --> 00:15:59,853
All right, but here's the deal.

345
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,724
I'll give you my supplier,

346
00:16:03,758 --> 00:16:04,925
but I'm not a rat.

347
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,701
'Cause this dude, he
ain't one of my boys.

348
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,201
So this don't count as ratting.

349
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,902
Makes perfect sense to me.

350
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,305
Name's Scoot. White dude.

351
00:16:14,372 --> 00:16:15,439
Scoot?

352
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,274
Yeah.

353
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,576
He's really...

354
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,644
white.

355
00:16:23,381 --> 00:16:25,282
What's he look like?

356
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,284
Just a real white dude.

357
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,753
Wear them lumberjack shirts.

358
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,557
One time, I went to him.

359
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:35,925
I met him at this... this mini-mart.

360
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,628
- Where?
- Right off the lake.

361
00:16:37,662 --> 00:16:39,897
Slid down LSD up north.

362
00:16:39,931 --> 00:16:41,632
Some rich-ass neighborhood.

363
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:42,900
Lawrence or something.

364
00:16:42,934 --> 00:16:44,335
All right, when was this?

365
00:16:44,402 --> 00:16:46,337
Two Mondays ago.

366
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,307
Check it out.

367
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:56,680
This is from two weeks ago?

368
00:16:56,748 --> 00:16:57,782
Yeah.

369
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,650
The black dude... never seen him before.

370
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:01,652
That other guy, he comes
in here every other week

371
00:17:01,686 --> 00:17:05,289
looking for White Owl
cigars and rolling papers.

372
00:17:05,323 --> 00:17:06,690
He loves those blunts.

373
00:17:06,758 --> 00:17:08,192
And you wouldn't believe
how much fuel he burns

374
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,360
in that boat of his, either.

375
00:17:09,427 --> 00:17:10,494
Where can we find him?

376
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,363
What'd he do, huh?

377
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,465
- Parking tickets.
- Okay.

378
00:17:14,499 --> 00:17:16,634
I got you. I don't know where he lives.

379
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,602
Uh, but he's got a boat at the marina.

380
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:21,605
Uh, just a few days ago I had to
take some propane tanks to him.

381
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,340
They were having some kind of rager.

382
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,876
Yeah, I could show you
where the slip is at.

383
00:17:26,978 --> 00:17:28,212
"Whiplash."

384
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,549
- Well, there she is.
- With a gash in the hull.

385
00:17:31,616 --> 00:17:34,185
What if this wasn't a murder at all,

386
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,853
just a high-speed accident?

387
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:38,455
Either way, we're after a fentanyl ring.

388
00:17:42,994 --> 00:17:45,196
Waypoints for Blind River, Ontario,

389
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,365
Mackinaw City, Michigan, and Chicago.

390
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:53,370
We ran a quantitative and
qualitative analysis

391
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,839
on the sample from the lake.

392
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,674
It's not coming back as fentanyl.

393
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:57,808
What are you talking about?

394
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,710
Chemically, fentanyl's a pharmaceutical

395
00:17:59,744 --> 00:18:01,579
designed to treat cancer patients...

396
00:18:01,646 --> 00:18:05,549
potent enough that a molecule
on the head of a pin is deadly,

397
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,585
but if even a molecule's altered,

398
00:18:07,652 --> 00:18:09,320
then technically, it's not
a controlled substance.

399
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:10,888
That's what I'm talking about.

400
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:12,756
Do you know how many OD's
we have off this stuff

401
00:18:12,824 --> 00:18:13,757
down at Med?

402
00:18:13,825 --> 00:18:14,758
I do.

403
00:18:14,826 --> 00:18:16,393
But they OD'd on fentanyl

404
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,761
that had been fully processed.

405
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:18,863
The batch you found in the backpack

406
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:19,997
hadn't been activated yet,

407
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,532
which I'm assuming they were gonna do

408
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:22,900
when they got to Chicago.

409
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:25,569
So you're saying that our batch

410
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,004
is off by a molecule?

411
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:28,672
That is correct.

412
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,344
Yeah, I got him.

413
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,879
They're coming in right now. Thanks.

414
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,614
Sarge?

415
00:18:36,681 --> 00:18:38,415
- Sarge, you want to see this.
- Yeah?

416
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,453
High-speed impact would be consistent

417
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:44,621
with blunt force trauma to our vic.

418
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:45,890
So I think the owner of the boat

419
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,458
is the one bringing the
fentanyl in from Canada.

420
00:18:47,525 --> 00:18:48,592
Mm.

421
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,428
Just got the test results back from ISP.

422
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,365
Technically, it's not fentanyl.

423
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:55,699
What?

424
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:58,936
Apparently the manufacturer's
altered molecules

425
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,271
so that this stuff wouldn't be

426
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,573
on the U.S. government's
controlled substance list.

427
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:04,375
Until it's activated,

428
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,643
it's basically baby powder.

429
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:08,912
So we don't have a case?

430
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:19,091
Oh, excelent.

431
00:19:19,278 --> 00:19:20,433
Perfect, thanks.

432
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,559
And this, um, is Sergeant Platt,

433
00:19:22,626 --> 00:19:23,560
who I've been telling you about.

434
00:19:23,627 --> 00:19:24,692
Hey.

435
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:26,108
You a Hawks fan?

436
00:19:29,644 --> 00:19:32,445
That's great, because I
really need a wingman

437
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,970
to keep an eye on this game

438
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:35,739
while I'm chained to this desk.

439
00:19:35,773 --> 00:19:38,208
Will you do that for me?

440
00:19:38,242 --> 00:19:39,543
- Sure.
- Thanks.

441
00:19:39,577 --> 00:19:40,744
Don't forget your shirt.

442
00:19:40,778 --> 00:19:42,479
- Sit right over there, buddy.
- You got it?

443
00:19:44,315 --> 00:19:47,617
Kid's mom takes a
nursing course at Lakeside.

444
00:19:47,652 --> 00:19:49,286
Ends in an hour.

445
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,154
Why would someone stab their husband

446
00:19:51,222 --> 00:19:52,289
and then go to class?

447
00:19:52,323 --> 00:19:54,991
'Cause some people are crazy, Burgess.

448
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,068
Leigh Crewes.

449
00:20:05,102 --> 00:20:06,570
Yeah?

450
00:20:06,604 --> 00:20:08,738
Were you at your ex-husband's
place earlier this morning?

451
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:10,273
Yeah, so?

452
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:12,108
Did you have words with him?

453
00:20:12,143 --> 00:20:14,477
He insulted
me and screamed at me,

454
00:20:14,512 --> 00:20:15,612
if that's what you mean.

455
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:17,614
Did it make you mad enough to stab him?

456
00:20:17,648 --> 00:20:19,149
What?

457
00:20:21,085 --> 00:20:22,452
I didn't stab him.

458
00:20:22,486 --> 00:20:24,521
Gerry's crazy.

459
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,091
He's been making threats for years...

460
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,693
said he'd do anything to keep Chase.

461
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,695
Okay, did you ever file
a restraining order?

462
00:20:31,762 --> 00:20:33,363
Do you have any paperwork
to back this up?

463
00:20:33,431 --> 00:20:35,165
No.

464
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:38,201
Ma'am, now is the time
to get ahead of this.

465
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:39,336
You got to tell us the truth,

466
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,503
or you're never gonna
see your kid again.

467
00:20:40,538 --> 00:20:41,504
- No!
- Whoa.

468
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:42,806
He's not well!

469
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,107
He's been going through
a serious depression.

470
00:20:44,141 --> 00:20:45,108
I understand that, ma'am.

471
00:20:45,142 --> 00:20:46,176
Can you put your hands on the roof?

472
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,611
Uh-uh, no way. I didn't do anything.

473
00:20:47,645 --> 00:20:49,112
Ma'am, hands on the roof.
I understand that.

474
00:20:49,146 --> 00:20:50,113
- Put your hands on the roof.
- I'm not kidding.

475
00:20:50,147 --> 00:20:51,281
We'll sort it out later.

476
00:20:51,315 --> 00:20:55,051
I can't believe this! It's okay.

477
00:21:07,064 --> 00:21:09,366
- Detective Olinsky.
- Ms. Clarendon.

478
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,234
Hey. Hi.

479
00:21:11,302 --> 00:21:13,803
Have you...

480
00:21:13,838 --> 00:21:16,339
figured out who killed Tyler?

481
00:21:16,374 --> 00:21:17,540
Not yet.

482
00:21:17,575 --> 00:21:20,410
But I promise to contact
you as soon as we do.

483
00:21:20,478 --> 00:21:22,379
At first, I couldn't bring myself

484
00:21:22,413 --> 00:21:24,347
to go through Tyler's things,

485
00:21:24,382 --> 00:21:28,218
but when I did, I found this.

486
00:21:28,252 --> 00:21:32,389
He was applying to the
Chicago Fire Department.

487
00:21:32,423 --> 00:21:36,693
So are you sure he was
involved in something illegal?

488
00:21:36,727 --> 00:21:39,729
Because I'm going to have
to deal with his loss,

489
00:21:39,764 --> 00:21:42,332
and knowing that maybe he
turned his life around

490
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:44,768
would give me some comfort.

491
00:21:47,872 --> 00:21:49,839
You can tell me.

492
00:21:52,276 --> 00:21:55,111
I'm sorry, but it's looking
like he was involved.

493
00:22:09,894 --> 00:22:12,095
- Hey, Will.
- Hey, Kev.

494
00:22:12,129 --> 00:22:15,098
- What's up?
- How you doing on the case?

495
00:22:15,132 --> 00:22:16,366
Covering every angle.

496
00:22:19,537 --> 00:22:22,305
You got to get this stuff
off the streets, Jay.

497
00:22:22,373 --> 00:22:24,307
I just declared a 16-year-old girl.

498
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,242
Sophomore at Rutherford High.

499
00:22:26,277 --> 00:22:28,745
Her mother found out I had a
brother who's a detective.

500
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:30,613
She asked me to give you that.

501
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:34,784
I don't mean to push, man.

502
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:36,920
I just... I need you to know.

503
00:22:36,954 --> 00:22:38,388
It's not just career junkies.

504
00:22:38,422 --> 00:22:39,489
Kids are dying out there.

505
00:22:39,557 --> 00:22:42,625
Yeah. Okay.

506
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,461
All right.

507
00:22:44,495 --> 00:22:46,296
- Got it?
- Yeah.

508
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:49,165
Sarge, boat's owned by John
and Christie Fitzgerald.

509
00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:50,633
They're a well-connected Chicago couple

510
00:22:50,668 --> 00:22:52,502
who made a good chunk of
change in construction.

511
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,636
I just checked with Customs.

512
00:22:53,671 --> 00:22:54,804
As of three days ago,

513
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:56,172
they've been on vacation in Italy.

514
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,474
Any border crossing to Canada?

515
00:22:57,508 --> 00:22:58,475
None.

516
00:22:58,509 --> 00:22:59,642
But their son, Scott,

517
00:22:59,677 --> 00:23:01,311
attends Central Chicago U.

518
00:23:01,345 --> 00:23:02,645
Goes by "Scoot."

519
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,281
He and Tony Chin were
in Chem I together.

520
00:23:05,316 --> 00:23:06,916
All right, Mouse, get me a
nexus on the phone records

521
00:23:06,951 --> 00:23:09,352
for him, Tony Chin, and Tyler.

522
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,954
And have patrol pick this Scoot up

523
00:23:10,988 --> 00:23:11,955
and bring him in here.

524
00:23:11,989 --> 00:23:13,690
I want to talk to that guy.

525
00:23:26,637 --> 00:23:29,472
You not wanting to be here isn't
gonna work either, Mouse.

526
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:34,277
- I talked to him.
- I'm not talking to you.

527
00:23:34,311 --> 00:23:35,845
You want to stay, then do your job.

528
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,782
You don't want to stay, that's
a separate conversation.

529
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:40,950
I've done my job.

530
00:23:40,985 --> 00:23:43,553
I've done my job since
the day I got here.

531
00:23:43,621 --> 00:23:44,821
Busted my ass for you.

532
00:23:44,855 --> 00:23:46,389
I never... never once asked for OT.

533
00:23:46,457 --> 00:23:48,558
And all I'm asking for is a favor...

534
00:23:48,626 --> 00:23:50,827
a favor so that maybe I can live my life

535
00:23:50,861 --> 00:23:52,295
the way that I'd like to.

536
00:23:52,329 --> 00:23:54,397
Don't go out like this, Mouse.

537
00:23:56,534 --> 00:23:57,867
You've come too far.

538
00:24:00,404 --> 00:24:01,704
You know, maybe Voight's right.

539
00:24:01,739 --> 00:24:03,239
Maybe I just need to clear out of here.

540
00:24:03,307 --> 00:24:05,341
What are you gonna do
with your felony record?

541
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,810
You gonna go back to boosting stereos?

542
00:24:06,844 --> 00:24:08,244
That guy on the board...
that could've been me

543
00:24:08,312 --> 00:24:09,412
when I came back here...

544
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,014
high, doing something
stupid and dangerous.

545
00:24:11,048 --> 00:24:13,249
Greg, that is not you.
That's not you now.

546
00:24:13,317 --> 00:24:14,717
I am telling you, Jay,

547
00:24:14,752 --> 00:24:17,554
if I lose my job because
of a bender or whatever...

548
00:24:17,588 --> 00:24:21,257
I'm looking at Tyler, and
that could've been me.

549
00:24:21,325 --> 00:24:22,492
It still could be me.

550
00:24:22,526 --> 00:24:24,761
- No.
- Hey, hey, guys.

551
00:24:24,829 --> 00:24:26,329
We're done here.

552
00:24:26,363 --> 00:24:28,431
Okay? We are on a case.

553
00:24:28,499 --> 00:24:30,266
Mouse, go back to your desk.

554
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:31,668
Yeah.

555
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:36,005
Come on.

556
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,507
- Hey.
- I'm, I'm...

557
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:39,342
I'm gonna get through to him.

558
00:24:39,376 --> 00:24:40,944
And he's gonna be all right.

559
00:24:41,011 --> 00:24:42,745
Listen.

560
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,747
What you two went through

561
00:24:44,782 --> 00:24:48,384
and what you carry is real.

562
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,453
And you know that if you ever
need my help carrying it,

563
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:51,721
you just have to ask me.

564
00:24:51,755 --> 00:24:53,923
Why are you not listening to him?

565
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:56,392
Because going back is not
the right move for him.

566
00:24:56,427 --> 00:24:57,694
For you.

567
00:24:57,728 --> 00:25:00,797
Him going back is not
the right move for you.

568
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:04,968
But if it was... if you were
the one that wanted to go...

569
00:25:05,035 --> 00:25:07,570
would you let anybody stand in your way?

570
00:25:14,311 --> 00:25:15,945
Come on.

571
00:25:22,061 --> 00:25:23,529
How's it going, Scoot?

572
00:25:25,264 --> 00:25:27,899
Mind if I call you Scoot?

573
00:25:27,933 --> 00:25:29,934
I have no idea why I'm here.

574
00:25:30,002 --> 00:25:31,202
Well...

575
00:25:31,236 --> 00:25:34,539
We found a boat in your
mom and dad's name.

576
00:25:34,573 --> 00:25:36,941
It's got a pretty big-sized
dent in its hull.

577
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,580
Okay.

578
00:25:45,951 --> 00:25:48,052
Look, I was running bud.

579
00:25:48,086 --> 00:25:49,554
From Canada.

580
00:25:49,588 --> 00:25:51,455
Super easy. No harm done.

581
00:25:51,523 --> 00:25:54,692
Just a little recreational marijuana.

582
00:25:54,726 --> 00:25:57,295
And then I meet this guy Tony Chin

583
00:25:57,362 --> 00:25:58,563
in my class.

584
00:25:58,597 --> 00:26:00,398
And...

585
00:26:00,432 --> 00:26:02,233
yeah, this is him.

586
00:26:02,267 --> 00:26:04,235
Tony thinks he's a gangster.

587
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:06,404
But the real guy is his uncle, Mr. Ng.

588
00:26:09,274 --> 00:26:10,908
First name Walter?

589
00:26:10,943 --> 00:26:12,543
Yeah. Yeah, him.

590
00:26:14,379 --> 00:26:17,081
So Tony tells him about our thing.

591
00:26:17,115 --> 00:26:19,550
Next thing we know, Ng is sweating us

592
00:26:19,585 --> 00:26:22,220
to bring in fentanyl on the same route.

593
00:26:22,254 --> 00:26:23,387
And I told Tony, "Hey, man,

594
00:26:23,422 --> 00:26:24,422
"I'll drive the boat;

595
00:26:24,456 --> 00:26:26,123
"I'll get it to the dealers.

596
00:26:26,158 --> 00:26:27,658
But the other stuff, you
got to figure out."

597
00:26:27,726 --> 00:26:30,428
So, like, him recruiting the...

598
00:26:30,462 --> 00:26:32,597
losers to wear the backpacks?

599
00:26:32,631 --> 00:26:34,098
That's all him.

600
00:26:34,132 --> 00:26:35,600
Losers like Tyler.

601
00:26:42,975 --> 00:26:44,675
These the losers you're talking about?

602
00:26:48,113 --> 00:26:49,580
That night...

603
00:26:49,615 --> 00:26:50,648
what happened?

604
00:26:53,518 --> 00:26:54,986
There was a heavy fog.

605
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,520
I didn't want to go, I swear.

606
00:26:56,588 --> 00:26:57,521
Mm-hmm.

607
00:26:57,589 --> 00:26:59,991
But Ng put a gun on the table.

608
00:27:01,693 --> 00:27:04,028
I had no choice.

609
00:27:04,096 --> 00:27:05,463
You don't say no to him.

610
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:08,132
I don't, anyway.

611
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,638
What did you hit?

612
00:27:13,672 --> 00:27:18,276
I guess Tyler was seasick,
leaning over the edge, and...

613
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:21,345
I didn't see the buoy until
the boat clipped it.

614
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,114
This is murder

615
00:27:23,148 --> 00:27:24,181
we're looking at.

616
00:27:26,685 --> 00:27:28,519
Maybe...

617
00:27:28,553 --> 00:27:31,022
maybe we can leave some
of it out of the report,

618
00:27:31,056 --> 00:27:34,692
but, I mean, you're gonna
have to help us take down Ng.

619
00:27:37,362 --> 00:27:40,164
What do you mean, help
you bring him down?

620
00:27:40,198 --> 00:27:43,000
We set it up. You go in.

621
00:27:43,035 --> 00:27:44,535
- We got eyes on...
- Like, undercover?

622
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:47,171
Correct.

623
00:27:47,205 --> 00:27:48,639
Ng is a killer.

624
00:27:50,575 --> 00:27:54,045
How long you think you're
gonna last at Stateville?

625
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,713
Scoot?

626
00:28:08,593 --> 00:28:10,194
You know, what you're going through

627
00:28:10,228 --> 00:28:12,763
is really hard.

628
00:28:12,831 --> 00:28:15,533
But it is all gonna work out, okay?

629
00:28:19,237 --> 00:28:20,438
You know, my mom...

630
00:28:20,505 --> 00:28:24,342
boy, she could get really angry, too.

631
00:28:24,376 --> 00:28:27,745
But I always knew it wasn't my fault.

632
00:28:29,448 --> 00:28:31,782
It's important for you
to realize that, Chase.

633
00:28:34,219 --> 00:28:36,587
My dad's the one who gets real angry.

634
00:28:53,405 --> 00:28:57,608
I don't like
owing people favors.

635
00:28:57,642 --> 00:28:59,477
You and me both.

636
00:28:59,544 --> 00:29:02,780
But is it possible to hack
into someone's phone remotely?

637
00:29:02,814 --> 00:29:04,382
Uh, technically, yes. Legally, no.

638
00:29:04,416 --> 00:29:05,549
Why?

639
00:29:05,584 --> 00:29:07,718
Because this kid Burgess
and Tay picked up

640
00:29:07,753 --> 00:29:09,787
is about to lose his mom
on an agg assault charge.

641
00:29:09,821 --> 00:29:13,090
I need to make sure it went down
the way her ex said it did.

642
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:15,493
This is the dad's phone
number, name, and DOB.

643
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,429
Okay, well, I will see what I can see.

644
00:29:18,463 --> 00:29:19,764
Thanks, Mouse.

645
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:22,466
Yeah, you got it.

646
00:29:24,336 --> 00:29:26,771
Hey.

647
00:29:26,805 --> 00:29:28,272
Hey, what's up?

648
00:29:28,306 --> 00:29:30,474
Um, listen, man.

649
00:29:33,512 --> 00:29:35,746
Do whatever it is you need to do.

650
00:29:35,781 --> 00:29:38,516
All right?

651
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:40,117
I'm behind you...

652
00:29:40,152 --> 00:29:41,752
100%.

653
00:29:45,424 --> 00:29:46,457
Walter Ng.

654
00:29:46,491 --> 00:29:48,359
Hardcore crime boss in Chinatown.

655
00:29:48,427 --> 00:29:49,794
Alleged to be in everything
from prostitution

656
00:29:49,828 --> 00:29:51,462
to high-stakes gambling.

657
00:29:51,496 --> 00:29:53,798
He's been identified as the
source of the fentanyl

658
00:29:53,832 --> 00:29:55,166
coming into Chicago,

659
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,135
so he is responsible by
coercion for Tyler's death.

660
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,437
His operation's slick.

661
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:01,639
The modified fentanyl
originates in China

662
00:30:01,673 --> 00:30:05,209
and gets shipped to Ng's connect
in Blind River, Ontario.

663
00:30:05,277 --> 00:30:06,377
And our boy Scoot...

664
00:30:06,445 --> 00:30:07,878
he zips up from the marina.

665
00:30:07,946 --> 00:30:10,614
Tony Chin brings a couple of
college kids to mule it down.

666
00:30:10,649 --> 00:30:13,617
Marine unit says they put
oxygen tanks and a GPS

667
00:30:13,652 --> 00:30:15,519
in weighted backpacks
along with the dope.

668
00:30:15,554 --> 00:30:16,687
If the Coast Guard rolls up,

669
00:30:16,721 --> 00:30:19,223
dump the bag, come
back later that night,

670
00:30:19,291 --> 00:30:21,492
press a button, and boom...
floats to the surface.

671
00:30:21,526 --> 00:30:24,161
Then from Canada, they head here,

672
00:30:24,196 --> 00:30:26,163
south of Mackinaw City, Michigan.

673
00:30:26,198 --> 00:30:28,332
They stop to refuel at Rowley's Bay.

674
00:30:28,366 --> 00:30:29,500
Then down into Chicago.

675
00:30:29,534 --> 00:30:31,702
Where Scoot gives the drugs to Red

676
00:30:31,736 --> 00:30:33,204
and several other scumbag dealers,

677
00:30:33,238 --> 00:30:34,572
and they sell it to kids on the street.

678
00:30:34,639 --> 00:30:36,006
We can't touch Ng

679
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:38,260
because he's modifying the
chemistry of the fentanyl.

680
00:30:38,292 --> 00:30:41,095
Yeah, but as soon as he
processes it here in Chicago,

681
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,956
we can hit him with calculated
criminal drug conspiracy

682
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,072
and accessory to murder.

683
00:30:45,104 --> 00:30:48,207
Any word on why he allows
himself to be called Scoot?

684
00:30:49,275 --> 00:30:51,076
None yet.

685
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,644
Yo, Sarge, you got to see this.

686
00:30:52,712 --> 00:30:54,546
Scoot made contact.

687
00:30:55,615 --> 00:30:57,282
Okay, I'm listening.

688
00:30:57,317 --> 00:30:59,318
They're building a temporary lab.

689
00:30:59,385 --> 00:31:00,452
Tony and me are supposed to meet there

690
00:31:00,486 --> 00:31:01,720
to process the fentanyl.

691
00:31:01,754 --> 00:31:03,055
Good, when and where?

692
00:31:03,089 --> 00:31:05,157
Tonight. Location TBD.

693
00:31:05,225 --> 00:31:06,491
Ng's gonna be there, too.

694
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,994
He's usually there when
you process the fentanyl?

695
00:31:10,129 --> 00:31:12,231
No, but...

696
00:31:12,265 --> 00:31:13,465
what?

697
00:31:13,499 --> 00:31:15,334
Now you don't want him?

698
00:31:15,401 --> 00:31:17,603
Fine, I'll text him...

699
00:31:17,637 --> 00:31:19,638
tell him not to show up.

700
00:31:23,276 --> 00:31:25,477
Ng wants it done, so he'll
be there for pickup.

701
00:31:31,017 --> 00:31:32,985
All lined up, Sarge.

702
00:31:34,354 --> 00:31:36,154
Yeah.

703
00:31:37,657 --> 00:31:39,124
That is a UC phone.

704
00:31:39,158 --> 00:31:40,592
It looks and acts like a regular phone,

705
00:31:40,627 --> 00:31:41,994
so if anybody checks it out,

706
00:31:42,028 --> 00:31:45,097
they won't be able to tell
that it transmits audio to us.

707
00:31:46,032 --> 00:31:47,299
And what's that?

708
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:48,634
<i>This is a pinhole camera.</i>

709
00:31:48,668 --> 00:31:50,135
<i>Whichever way this is looking</i>

710
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:52,004
<i>is the way we're gonna be able to see.</i>

711
00:31:52,038 --> 00:31:53,105
<i>Okay.</i>

712
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:57,276
- This guy's gonna kill me.
- No.

713
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,510
He is.

714
00:31:58,544 --> 00:32:00,178
Scoot, I know you're out
of your element here,

715
00:32:00,213 --> 00:32:02,047
but we are very much in ours, okay?

716
00:32:02,115 --> 00:32:03,482
So trust us.

717
00:32:03,516 --> 00:32:04,650
Relax.

718
00:32:04,684 --> 00:32:06,518
Okay.

719
00:32:06,552 --> 00:32:08,353
- Come on.
- All right.

720
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:26,705
We're through the south entrance.

721
00:32:43,723 --> 00:32:45,057
We're in.

722
00:32:47,727 --> 00:32:49,094
Switch over.

723
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:54,666
We're in position.

724
00:32:54,701 --> 00:32:55,767
Standing by.

725
00:33:14,587 --> 00:33:15,787
<i>Mr. Ng sent me.</i>

726
00:33:26,766 --> 00:33:28,300
Okay, there's Tony Chin.

727
00:33:28,368 --> 00:33:29,868
<i>Hurry up. You're late.</i>

728
00:33:29,902 --> 00:33:31,136
<i>Everything ready to go?</i>

729
00:33:33,706 --> 00:33:35,707
Mm, along with some trigger-pullers.

730
00:33:42,815 --> 00:33:44,583
Does anybody see Ng?

731
00:33:44,617 --> 00:33:45,938
<i>Negative.</i>

732
00:33:46,103 --> 00:33:48,146
<i>No, nothing.</i>

733
00:33:52,118 --> 00:33:53,252
There's the buyer.

734
00:33:53,286 --> 00:33:55,020
I don't see Ng, Sarge.

735
00:33:55,088 --> 00:33:56,688
Do you?

736
00:33:57,991 --> 00:33:59,157
Stand by.

737
00:34:02,762 --> 00:34:04,963
Something's not right.

738
00:34:04,998 --> 00:34:06,298
All right, but the converted fentanyl's

739
00:34:06,332 --> 00:34:07,599
about to walk out the door.

740
00:34:12,672 --> 00:34:14,706
He's leaving. Got to go now.

741
00:34:14,774 --> 00:34:16,041
Move in.

742
00:34:16,109 --> 00:34:17,042
Go. Go!

743
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,977
Chicago PD! Nobody move!

744
00:34:19,012 --> 00:34:20,512
Chicago PD! Get back!

745
00:34:20,546 --> 00:34:21,780
- Don't move! Don't move!
- Stop!

746
00:34:23,116 --> 00:34:24,316
Chicago PD! Everybody's hands, now!

747
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,484
- Now, now!
- Back it up!

748
00:34:25,518 --> 00:34:26,685
- Get down on the ground!
- Walk this way.

749
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,387
- Get on the ground!
- Walk this way.

750
00:34:28,454 --> 00:34:31,290
- Keep your hands spread out!
- Get on the ground!

751
00:34:31,324 --> 00:34:33,625
Police! Freeze! Turn around!

752
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,661
Turn around. Turn around.

753
00:34:35,695 --> 00:34:37,229
Don't look at me. Look at the ground!

754
00:34:37,297 --> 00:34:38,664
Don't move!

755
00:34:38,698 --> 00:34:40,198
Drop it!

756
00:34:40,233 --> 00:34:41,466
On your knees.

757
00:34:42,669 --> 00:34:45,107
Get down. Hands behind your back.

758
00:34:48,623 --> 00:34:50,364
Man, why are you cuffing me?

759
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,623
I did what you guys asked.

760
00:34:51,657 --> 00:34:53,091
I knew it, you piece of sh...

761
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:54,759
- Shut your mouth.
- You're on your own, dude.

762
00:34:58,664 --> 00:35:00,632
Tony Chin.

763
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:01,733
Stand him up.

764
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,470
Where's your uncle?

765
00:35:05,504 --> 00:35:06,671
He's supposed to be here.

766
00:35:06,739 --> 00:35:08,340
I don't know what you're talking about.

767
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:10,175
Yeah.

768
00:35:10,243 --> 00:35:11,509
Well, kid, guess what.

769
00:35:11,577 --> 00:35:13,745
You got caught holding the bag.

770
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:17,482
Murder, calculated
criminal drug conspiracy.

771
00:35:17,516 --> 00:35:18,583
Haul him in.

772
00:35:50,283 --> 00:35:52,117
You can't park there.

773
00:35:58,858 --> 00:36:01,459
Sergeant Voight to see Walter Ng.

774
00:36:02,695 --> 00:36:04,329
Open that door.

775
00:36:06,132 --> 00:36:07,565
This way.

776
00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:10,802
Policeman coming your way.

777
00:36:20,646 --> 00:36:21,746
What's up, Walter?

778
00:36:21,814 --> 00:36:23,815
Sergeant.

779
00:36:25,918 --> 00:36:28,253
Let me get this straight.

780
00:36:28,321 --> 00:36:31,189
You served up your own nephew?

781
00:36:31,223 --> 00:36:33,325
Man, isn't that against some kind of...

782
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,260
tradition or something?

783
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:36,261
Tony?

784
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:37,429
Is that who you're talking about?

785
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:38,530
Mm.

786
00:36:38,564 --> 00:36:39,764
Tony's had a drug and alcohol problem

787
00:36:39,832 --> 00:36:41,232
for years now.

788
00:36:41,267 --> 00:36:43,368
Gets to a point where you just, uh,

789
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:44,769
stop answering the phone.

790
00:36:46,339 --> 00:36:48,606
I got to admit...

791
00:36:48,674 --> 00:36:50,442
we really thought we had you this time.

792
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:52,277
Whatever that means.

793
00:36:52,345 --> 00:36:56,448
It means you keep running
your illegal card games,

794
00:36:56,515 --> 00:37:00,285
counterfeit watches, massage parlors.

795
00:37:00,353 --> 00:37:02,620
You take your chances; we'll take ours.

796
00:37:03,723 --> 00:37:05,890
But if you pump any more
fentanyl into my city,

797
00:37:05,925 --> 00:37:08,793
they're gonna be pulling
you out of the river.

798
00:37:08,861 --> 00:37:10,261
You understand?

799
00:37:11,464 --> 00:37:12,564
Sure.

800
00:37:19,872 --> 00:37:21,706
That was a yes or no question.

801
00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:25,810
Yes.

802
00:37:25,878 --> 00:37:27,445
I understand.

803
00:37:40,993 --> 00:37:43,395
I tunneled in on that dude's cell phone.

804
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:45,330
There's something you
should take a look at.

805
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,668
Oh, Lord.

806
00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:52,670
Will you send that to Burgess and Tay?

807
00:37:52,738 --> 00:37:54,806
Sure.

808
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,776
And, um, I heard you were looking

809
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,511
to get a felony disappeared.

810
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:07,352
I mean, how did you even...

811
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,520
Jay told me.

812
00:38:17,263 --> 00:38:20,532
17 Google searches on a
"Journal of Medicine" study

813
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:23,468
about non-fatal stab wounds?

814
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:25,003
What?

815
00:38:25,037 --> 00:38:27,439
Were you monitoring my phone?

816
00:38:27,473 --> 00:38:28,606
Is that even legal?

817
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:29,874
You said your ex stabbed
you in the neck,

818
00:38:29,942 --> 00:38:31,776
but your wound's not
consistent with that.

819
00:38:31,811 --> 00:38:33,978
She's 5'6". You're what, 6'3"?

820
00:38:34,013 --> 00:38:35,480
- I was sitting down.
- Oh.

821
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:37,816
You do a lot of arguing
sitting down, Jerry?

822
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:40,452
Look, you lost it.

823
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:42,720
You did a crazy thing.

824
00:38:42,788 --> 00:38:44,322
But if you ever want
to see your boy again,

825
00:38:44,356 --> 00:38:45,957
now is the time to tell the truth.

826
00:38:57,036 --> 00:38:58,970
Nine years of marriage.

827
00:39:00,072 --> 00:39:02,407
I gave up my job so I could stay home

828
00:39:02,475 --> 00:39:03,808
and take care of Chase.

829
00:39:05,077 --> 00:39:07,679
And she walks out for a classmate.

830
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:11,583
I gave her everything.

831
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,818
And now she won't even talk to me.

832
00:39:22,061 --> 00:39:24,429
So your mom never hurt your dad.

833
00:39:24,497 --> 00:39:25,430
You know that, right?

834
00:39:25,498 --> 00:39:27,599
- Yeah.
- Okay.

835
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:29,601
'Cause I have somebody here to see you.

836
00:39:29,668 --> 00:39:30,702
- Hi.
- Mom!

837
00:39:30,736 --> 00:39:32,837
Oh, sweetheart.

838
00:39:32,872 --> 00:39:35,607
We're going home, sweetheart.

839
00:39:35,674 --> 00:39:37,575
Thank you.

840
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,043
Yeah.

841
00:39:39,078 --> 00:39:41,012
So then who hurt my dad?

842
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:45,917
We'll talk about this. We got to go.

843
00:40:05,137 --> 00:40:06,905
- Hi.
- Yes?

844
00:40:08,574 --> 00:40:11,876
So, uh, Tyler can be
buried next to Grace.

845
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:21,619
Okay.

846
00:40:27,393 --> 00:40:28,993
Look.

847
00:40:29,061 --> 00:40:31,829
It's really easy for a woman
to catch a rep on this job,

848
00:40:31,897 --> 00:40:34,098
whether or not you deserve it.

849
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:36,634
It looks like I'm never
gonna get the chance to...

850
00:40:39,738 --> 00:40:42,674
Go after what you want, Kim.

851
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:43,975
Don't wait.

852
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:03,795
Come on in.

853
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:08,132
Sergeant.

854
00:41:08,167 --> 00:41:10,868
Yeah?

855
00:41:10,936 --> 00:41:13,171
I just wanted to...

856
00:41:13,205 --> 00:41:15,540
I just wanted to reiterate
my desire and my commitment

857
00:41:15,608 --> 00:41:17,809
to one day be detailed
up to Intelligence.

858
00:41:19,778 --> 00:41:21,446
I know that it was offered once before,

859
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,383
but I felt that I still had
something to learn in patrol.

860
00:41:25,451 --> 00:41:26,718
And I'm glad that I stayed.

861
00:41:26,785 --> 00:41:28,620
Yeah.

862
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:31,022
But if the opportunity ever
presented itself again,

863
00:41:31,056 --> 00:41:33,725
I... I just want you to know

864
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:36,027
that it would be the best
decision that you ever made

865
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:38,563
to have me be a part of your unit.

866
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:47,639
That's all.

867
00:41:47,673 --> 00:41:49,707
Be ready.

868
00:41:51,477 --> 00:41:52,543
I will.

869
00:41:52,578 --> 00:41:54,646
I am.
