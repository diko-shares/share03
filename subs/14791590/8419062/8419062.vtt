00:01:50.812 --> 00:01:53.948
(Rishi speaks in Hindi)

15
00:01:53.982 --> 00:01:56.183
- [Rishi] Somebody
fucked up my tire.

16
00:01:58.853 --> 00:02:01.488
(group laughing)

17
00:02:04.926 --> 00:02:06.094
- Rishi, it's no problem.

18
00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:07.829
You still got the
trailer at home, right?

19
00:02:07.862 --> 00:02:08.663
- Yes, boss.
- Okay.

20
00:02:08.696 --> 00:02:10.130
Pete, take my SUV,

21
00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:12.934
go get his trailer, come
back and pick him up.

22
00:02:12.967 --> 00:02:13.768
- Why me?

23
00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:14.602
How is this my fault?

24
00:02:14.636 --> 00:02:16.037
- Why?

25
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.605
Why are you always
arguing with me?

26
00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:19.974
Take my SUV, go back
and get the trailer,

27
00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:21.441
come back, and pick him up.

28
00:02:23.077 --> 00:02:23.878
- Not cool, Ellis.

29
00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:25.613
- What'd you say?

30
00:02:25.647 --> 00:02:26.514
It's not cool.

31
00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:28.983
You're right, Tommy.

32
00:02:29.017 --> 00:02:30.450
Rishi, you come with us.

33
00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:32.620
Tommy's gonna wait for Pete.

34
00:02:32.654 --> 00:02:33.453
- Wait, what?

35
00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:34.756
Why?

36
00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:36.156
- To give you a little time
to think about thinking twice

37
00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.893
before you open up your
fucking mouth again.

38
00:02:38.926 --> 00:02:40.427
Now, after you drop him off,

39
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.930
I want you to take
my SUV to my house,

40
00:02:42.964 --> 00:02:44.866
park it in the
driveway, lock the door,

41
00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:46.601
put the keys in the mailbox,

42
00:02:46.634 --> 00:02:49.103
and don't you fucking
drive like an animal.

43
00:02:49.137 --> 00:02:50.605
I don't want you
waking up my neighbors.

44
00:02:50.638 --> 00:02:51.438
You got it?

45
00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:52.073
- Got it.

46
00:02:52.106 --> 00:02:52.940
- You got it?

47
00:02:52.974 --> 00:02:54.174
- Got it.

48
00:02:54.876 --> 00:02:55.677
- Let's go.

49
00:02:57.545 --> 00:02:58.813
- Hey.

50
00:02:58.846 --> 00:03:00.247
Watch your fucking mouth.

51
00:03:00.915 --> 00:03:01.916
- [Ellis] Let's go.

52
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.919
- Keys, please.

53
00:03:04.952 --> 00:03:06.353
- You put a scratch in it

54
00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:07.220
and I'll shave your fucking
head in your sleep, you hear me?

55
00:03:07.254 --> 00:03:08.623
- Junior.
- I'm serious.

56
00:03:08.656 --> 00:03:09.957
- [Keko] Come on.

57
00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.668
(Tommy sighs)

58
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.045

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.815

(suspenseful music)

66
00:03:53.735 --> 00:03:55.069

Whoa. (groaning)

70
00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:06.147
What are you doing?

71
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.882
Who, hey, hey.

72
00:04:07.915 --> 00:04:09.550
- [Man] Shut up.

73
00:04:09.584 --> 00:04:10.283
- Okay.

74
00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:14.956
- [Man] Now you went to
a house in Queen Anne.

75
00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.257
You killed a man and a woman.

76
00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.093
There was a girl.

77
00:04:19.127 --> 00:04:20.695
(Tommy grunting)

78
00:04:20.728 --> 00:04:21.763
Where is she?

79
00:04:21.796 --> 00:04:23.131
- I don't know.

80
00:04:23.164 --> 00:04:24.599
I just send messages.

81
00:04:24.632 --> 00:04:25.833
- [Man] Good.

82
00:04:25.867 --> 00:04:27.902
That's exactly what
I need you to do.

83
00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:29.302
- I can memorize it.

84
00:04:29.336 --> 00:04:30.905
- [Man] No need.

85
00:04:30.938 --> 00:04:31.906
I'll just use your hand.

86
00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:33.306
(blade whooshing)

87
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.108
(blade slices)
(Tommy screaming)

88
00:04:34.142 --> 00:04:36.978
(brooding music)

89
00:04:41.883 --> 00:04:44.051
- [Interviewer] What about
these bizarre child abductions

90
00:04:44.085 --> 00:04:45.586
all over the metro area?

91
00:04:46.687 --> 00:04:47.922
- [Martin] Well, ever
since this president

92
00:04:47.955 --> 00:04:48.923
weakened our military,

93
00:04:48.956 --> 00:04:50.323
we sent a signal to the world

94
00:04:50.357 --> 00:04:51.491
that they can do
whatever they want

95
00:04:51.526 --> 00:04:53.528
and we're just gonna
sit down and take it.

96
00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:54.996
- [Interviewer] Wait,
wait, wait, wait.

97
00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:57.698
How do you connect the president
to this wave of abductions?

98
00:04:57.732 --> 00:04:59.299
- [Martin] If we show weakness,

99
00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:02.069
bad hombres will always
use it against us.

100
00:05:02.103 --> 00:05:04.238
Now they want our children.

101
00:05:04.272 --> 00:05:05.139
- [Interviewer] What
about you, Roger?

102
00:05:05.173 --> 00:05:06.574
What do you think?

103
00:05:06.607 --> 00:05:08.176
- [Roger] I have to
disagree with Martin.

104
00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:09.644
This is not about geopolitics.

105
00:05:09.677 --> 00:05:11.279
This is something
darker than that.

106
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:12.814
- [Interviewer] Like what?

107
00:05:12.847 --> 00:05:15.016
- [Roger] I believe we
have an alien problem.

108
00:05:15.783 --> 00:05:16.884
- You know what?

109
00:05:16.918 --> 00:05:19.020
When we get there, you go.

110
00:05:19.053 --> 00:05:20.387
I'll skip the freak Show.

111
00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:23.057
- What?

112
00:05:26.794 --> 00:05:29.362
- I'm not wasting my
time talking to tweakers.

113
00:05:30.832 --> 00:05:33.000
- I guess I'll do
my fucking job then.

114
00:05:33.968 --> 00:05:36.771
(brooding music)

115
00:05:43.077 --> 00:05:46.080
(car horn honking)

116
00:05:47.748 --> 00:05:50.785
(ominous music)

117
00:05:50.818 --> 00:05:53.386
(cat howling)

118
00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:58.926
(cat howling)

119
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.006
(fist pounding)

120
00:06:15.877 --> 00:06:18.613
(door clicking)

121
00:06:19.614 --> 00:06:20.114
- Hey.

122
00:06:22.316 --> 00:06:23.784
- [Santiago] Hey.

123
00:06:25.686 --> 00:06:26.386
- What?

124
00:06:28.256 --> 00:06:30.224
- I'm Detective Santiago.

125
00:06:30.258 --> 00:06:31.592
I'm here to speak
to Wendy Osborne

126
00:06:31.626 --> 00:06:33.127
about a missing two year boy.

127
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.962
- Oh, oh, yeah.

128
00:06:36.664 --> 00:06:37.164
What?

129
00:06:38.232 --> 00:06:39.432
You find him?

130
00:06:39.466 --> 00:06:40.167
- Okay, Wendy,

131
00:06:41.602 --> 00:06:43.971
let me enlighten you
about how life works

132
00:06:44.005 --> 00:06:45.740
outside your crank filled hut.

133
00:06:47.108 --> 00:06:48.910
When you call the police,

134
00:06:48.943 --> 00:06:51.379
the police officer
responds to the call.

135
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:54.215
Then he or she takes
an initial report.

136
00:06:54.248 --> 00:06:55.316
Then the detective, that's me,

137
00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:57.385
conducts a full investigation

138
00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:59.486
in order to solve
the issue at hand.

139
00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.022
And unfortunately,
that includes asking

140
00:07:01.055 --> 00:07:03.958
a lot of stupid questions
to a lot of dopey people.

141
00:07:05.226 --> 00:07:06.493
Can you understand that?

142
00:07:07.795 --> 00:07:08.495
- I got it.

143
00:07:10.398 --> 00:07:11.165
- [Santiago] Okay.

144
00:07:14.268 --> 00:07:16.871
You said that your
son was missing

145
00:07:16.904 --> 00:07:19.874
when you got back from the
grocery store, is that correct?

146
00:07:19.907 --> 00:07:20.775
- Yeah.

147
00:07:20.808 --> 00:07:22.209
(bell dings)

148
00:07:22.243 --> 00:07:23.711
- [Santiago] And aside from.

149
00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.014
- Put it in here.

150
00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:36.456
Yeah, just, just
put it anywhere.

151
00:07:39.327 --> 00:07:40.227
Okay.

152
00:07:41.195 --> 00:07:43.998
(brooding music)

153
00:07:51.305 --> 00:07:52.173
Are we done?

154
00:07:54.008 --> 00:07:56.410
- I, I, I'm, I'm confused.

155
00:07:56.444 --> 00:07:58.145
When you reported
your son missing-

156
00:07:58.179 --> 00:07:59.146
- It was her.

157
00:08:00.982 --> 00:08:02.083
(door clicks)

158
00:08:02.116 --> 00:08:03.017
She did.

159
00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:05.586
She called the fuzz.

160
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.423
That one, she's
always up in my shit.

161
00:08:09.457 --> 00:08:12.093
I told her it was none
of her goddamn business.

162
00:08:12.126 --> 00:08:13.461
- You people are animals.

163
00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:14.695
- [Wendy] Oh, you're an animal.

164
00:08:14.729 --> 00:08:16.496
- Where's that sweet baby?

165
00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.100
You probably pawned
him for some smack.

166
00:08:19.133 --> 00:08:20.768
She belongs in jail.

167
00:08:20.801 --> 00:08:23.270
- No, you should get arrested!
- No, no, no!

168
00:08:23.304 --> 00:08:24.739
- And put in hospice.

169
00:08:24.772 --> 00:08:27.041
You and your dried up cunt
can go dry up in jail.

170
00:08:27.074 --> 00:08:28.676
- [Neighbor] They're
gonna drag you out.

171
00:08:28.709 --> 00:08:31.012
- Oh, you think you're
better than everybody.

172
00:08:31.045 --> 00:08:33.247
- [Santiago] I think that,

173
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.850
I think I fucking hate people.

174
00:08:38.352 --> 00:08:40.788
It is what it is, I guess.

175
00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:43.824
But what it is, is
definitely shit.

176
00:08:44.725 --> 00:08:45.626
- So it's gonna be a win.

177
00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:46.894
It's gonna be an easy slash

178
00:08:46.927 --> 00:08:49.764
and Jim and Carol are
gonna be really happy.

179
00:08:49.797 --> 00:08:50.664
- You did a great job today.

180
00:08:50.698 --> 00:08:52.099
- It was a team effort.

181
00:08:55.803 --> 00:08:57.438
Ah, it's Sue, do you
mind if I take this?

182
00:08:57.471 --> 00:08:58.672
- No, not at all.

183
00:08:58.706 --> 00:08:59.940
Hey, do you want me to
order you something?

184
00:08:59.974 --> 00:09:00.674
- Coffee, please.

185
00:09:00.708 --> 00:09:02.076
- Okay, say hi to the family.

186
00:09:02.109 --> 00:09:03.611
- I will, I will.

187
00:09:04.945 --> 00:09:05.546
Hey babe.

188
00:09:05.579 --> 00:09:06.781
- [Susan] Where are you?

189
00:09:06.814 --> 00:09:08.315
- I'm just out to
lunch with the boss.

190
00:09:09.216 --> 00:09:10.418
Everything okay?

191
00:09:10.451 --> 00:09:12.653
- [Susan] You forgot
it was early out today.

192
00:09:12.686 --> 00:09:16.057
- [Max] Shit, I, I
completely forgot.

193
00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:17.324
Is she mad at me?

194
00:09:17.358 --> 00:09:18.292
- Everything's good here.

195
00:09:18.325 --> 00:09:19.827
Do you wanna talk to her?

196
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.530
She might be willing
to forgive you.

197
00:09:21.562 --> 00:09:22.763
- [Max] Yes, of course.

198
00:09:23.597 --> 00:09:24.799
- Hi Daddy.

199
00:09:24.832 --> 00:09:26.467
- I'm so sorry, I forgot
to pick you up today.

200
00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.269
- That's okay, Daddy.

201
00:09:29.103 --> 00:09:30.304
- [Max] Were you scared?

202
00:09:30.337 --> 00:09:31.839
- Nah, I knew you forgot.

203
00:09:31.872 --> 00:09:32.673
- [Max] What are you doing?

204
00:09:32.706 --> 00:09:33.908
- I'm drawing.

205
00:09:33.941 --> 00:09:35.676
Are you coming to my
cheerleading practice?

206
00:09:35.709 --> 00:09:36.844
- Honey, I wish I could.

207
00:09:36.877 --> 00:09:38.547
I just have to work really late

208
00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:41.348
and get this done
before the weekend.

209
00:09:41.382 --> 00:09:43.918
- You're always working.

210
00:09:43.951 --> 00:09:46.620
- How about when I
come home tonight,

211
00:09:46.654 --> 00:09:49.390
I will read you a book,
not mommy, but daddy?

212
00:09:49.423 --> 00:09:51.025
- Okay, bye daddy.

213
00:09:51.058 --> 00:09:51.659
- Okay, bye honey.

214
00:09:51.692 --> 00:09:52.860
I love you.

215
00:09:52.893 --> 00:09:54.495
- [Susan] That's
all you get, daddy.

216
00:09:54.529 --> 00:09:55.729
- Rough crowd.

217
00:09:55.763 --> 00:09:56.997
(group chattering)

218
00:09:57.031 --> 00:09:58.933
- Hey Rishi, I hear
you eat dick like a-

219
00:09:58.966 --> 00:09:59.867
- Yo, what's up?

220
00:10:01.068 --> 00:10:02.002
This is Jerry.

221
00:10:03.204 --> 00:10:04.371
Ellis said to say hi.

222
00:10:07.675 --> 00:10:09.310
- [Jerry] It's nice
to meet you guys.

223
00:10:10.545 --> 00:10:11.580
- Ellis sent you?

224
00:10:11.612 --> 00:10:12.313
- Yeah.

225
00:10:14.115 --> 00:10:14.815
- Have a seat.

226
00:10:20.421 --> 00:10:22.089
Hey, Rishi, you can
eat that shrimp?

227
00:10:22.857 --> 00:10:24.225
- Nah.

228
00:10:24.258 --> 00:10:25.092
- You don't like shrimp?

229
00:10:25.126 --> 00:10:26.694
- I don't eat Croatians.

230
00:10:30.231 --> 00:10:31.365
- What did you say?

231
00:10:31.398 --> 00:10:34.569
- I said I don't eat Croatians.

232
00:10:34.603 --> 00:10:37.705
- Hey, Rishi, I'll take
all your Croatians.

233
00:10:37.738 --> 00:10:40.741
- You mean crustacean
you fucking moron?

234
00:10:40.774 --> 00:10:43.177
- I don't eat sea cockroaches.

235
00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.614
- Why did you order shrimp if
you're not going to eat it?

236
00:10:45.646 --> 00:10:47.014
- The menu said prawn.

237
00:10:47.047 --> 00:10:49.618
I thought prawn was like
chicken or something.

238
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:50.718
- Shrimp is good.

239
00:10:51.986 --> 00:10:54.421
- Could taste like a big
titties mom's asshole.

240
00:10:54.455 --> 00:10:56.591
but I'm not eating
the motherfucker.

241
00:10:56.625 --> 00:10:58.325
- [Roxy] Are you
gonna eat the shrimp?

242
00:11:05.366 --> 00:11:06.433
- Did you meet everyone?

243
00:11:08.302 --> 00:11:09.737
- Yeah.

244
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:10.738
Best I could.

245
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.209
- Now why don't we cut
right to the chase?

246
00:11:16.477 --> 00:11:17.912
What can you bring
to this party?

247
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.681
- Professionalism.

248
00:11:22.016 --> 00:11:23.918
Got my sources and I know
how to handle things.

249
00:11:26.153 --> 00:11:27.988
The way I look at
it, my job is to,

250
00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:30.824
is to help you sleep at night.

251
00:11:32.126 --> 00:11:35.262
- I don't know, boss, but
something about this guy stinks.

252
00:11:35.296 --> 00:11:36.730
- Big John brought him.

253
00:11:46.473 --> 00:11:47.775
- Hey, Big John.

254
00:11:50.077 --> 00:11:51.546
Do I stink?

255
00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:52.813
- Don't smell bad to me.

256
00:11:55.216 --> 00:11:57.785
- You know, I would never
ever let a green horn

257
00:11:57.818 --> 00:11:59.787
take on a job like this.

258
00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.823
- I'm just looking for a
little bit of stability,

259
00:12:02.856 --> 00:12:06.293
and I'm hoping that
if I do my job right,

260
00:12:06.327 --> 00:12:07.895
you're happy with it,

261
00:12:07.928 --> 00:12:09.664
then maybe one day
you'll put in a good word

262
00:12:09.698 --> 00:12:10.764
for me at the firm.

263
00:12:14.368 --> 00:12:19.440
- Listen, kid, everybody
thinks this trade is, is easy,

264
00:12:20.207 --> 00:12:21.108
but it's not.

265
00:12:22.209 --> 00:12:23.911
It's just like every
other big corporation,

266
00:12:23.944 --> 00:12:26.814
you got people under you,
you got people above you.

267
00:12:26.847 --> 00:12:28.015
But at the end of the day,

268
00:12:28.048 --> 00:12:29.450
you still gotta
pay all your bills.

269
00:12:29.483 --> 00:12:32.654
You gotta pay your, your
mortgage, your property taxes.

270
00:12:32.687 --> 00:12:34.922
- Well, if you're
passing out advice,

271
00:12:34.955 --> 00:12:37.157
I'd take it anytime, man.

272
00:12:37.191 --> 00:12:38.125
Just wanna work.

273
00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.328
(traffic humming)

274
00:12:41.362 --> 00:12:43.864
- Hey, look, I, I
should probably go in

275
00:12:43.897 --> 00:12:45.099
and finish this lunch,

276
00:12:45.132 --> 00:12:48.168
but I will try and be
home as soon as possible

277
00:12:48.202 --> 00:12:51.506
and I'll read our little
nugget of book, okay?

278
00:12:51.539 --> 00:12:53.407
- Okay.
- All right, I love you.

279
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.609
- [Susan] I love you too.

280
00:12:54.643 --> 00:12:55.442
- Bye, honey.

281
00:13:02.283 --> 00:13:03.384
(group chattering)

282
00:13:03.417 --> 00:13:04.519
- Is everything okay?

283
00:13:04.552 --> 00:13:06.521
- Yeah, everything's great.

284
00:13:06.554 --> 00:13:07.888
Find anything you like.

285
00:13:07.921 --> 00:13:09.223
- Steak salad.

286
00:13:09.256 --> 00:13:10.257
I'm celebrating.

287
00:13:10.291 --> 00:13:12.026
- It's really good
here, trust me.

288
00:13:13.427 --> 00:13:15.496
All right, what do I want?

289
00:13:16.363 --> 00:13:19.199
(Jerry laughing)

290
00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:24.305
Hey, give me one second.

291
00:13:25.439 --> 00:13:27.074
I'll be right back.

292
00:13:28.809 --> 00:13:30.210
(Jerry laughs)

293
00:13:30.244 --> 00:13:32.681
- And just before
it was executed

294
00:13:32.714 --> 00:13:34.181
by the great state of Texas,

295
00:13:34.214 --> 00:13:36.850
my Uncle Davey said, kid,
"I got some advice for you."

296
00:13:37.719 --> 00:13:38.986
"Your home is your temple."

297
00:13:39.019 --> 00:13:41.723
"Never, ever bring your
business home with you,

298
00:13:41.756 --> 00:13:43.457
otherwise, you'll
always be working."

299
00:13:44.693 --> 00:13:46.360
"Keep your professional
life separate

300
00:13:46.393 --> 00:13:47.529
from your personal life."

301
00:13:50.598 --> 00:13:51.498
- [Max] Jerry.

302
00:13:52.567 --> 00:13:53.735
What are you doing here?

303
00:13:53.768 --> 00:13:55.469
Haven't heard from
you in months.

304
00:13:55.503 --> 00:13:56.303
Hey, hey.

305
00:13:58.773 --> 00:13:59.574
- Hey, what's up?

306
00:14:00.908 --> 00:14:03.010
Listen, this is not a
good time for me, man.

307
00:14:03.043 --> 00:14:04.445
- What's going on?

308
00:14:04.478 --> 00:14:06.548
- Can you not see I'm
talking business, man?

309
00:14:10.851 --> 00:14:12.886
I'll holler at you
when I can, all right?

310
00:14:13.921 --> 00:14:15.489
- What's your deal?

311
00:14:15.523 --> 00:14:17.324
- Well, what's my deal, man?

312
00:14:19.561 --> 00:14:20.894
You need to get outta here, man.

313
00:14:20.928 --> 00:14:23.263
I'll call you when
I can, all right?

314
00:14:23.297 --> 00:14:25.232
You're doing this
to me way too much.

315
00:14:27.802 --> 00:14:28.636
What are you deaf?

316
00:14:30.437 --> 00:14:31.905
I said get outta here, dude.

317
00:14:33.207 --> 00:14:34.041
- Okay.

318
00:14:34.074 --> 00:14:35.643
- [Jerry] Yeah, okay.

319
00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.650
(ominous music)

320
00:14:42.684 --> 00:14:44.251
- Everything okay?

321
00:14:44.284 --> 00:14:47.454
- That guy there is
a, he's my lawyer.

322
00:14:48.556 --> 00:14:49.724
Got me a plea deal

323
00:14:49.758 --> 00:14:51.959
and got out of
Walla Walla early.

324
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.430
Guess the guy thinks we're
friends now or something.

325
00:14:56.463 --> 00:14:59.466
Keeps, keeps asking me
for referrals and shit.

326
00:15:00.502 --> 00:15:03.605
Fucking lawyers,
blood sucking pricks.

327
00:15:05.673 --> 00:15:06.674
- Okay, kids, we're
finished here.

328
00:15:06.708 --> 00:15:07.908
I gotta get home.

329
00:15:07.941 --> 00:15:08.877
I got a new table
being delivered.

330
00:15:08.909 --> 00:15:10.110
I wanna make sure those assholes

331
00:15:10.144 --> 00:15:11.979
don't shatter the
glass this time.

332
00:15:30.532 --> 00:15:32.667
- What are you drinking?

333
00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:33.868
- Coffee.

334
00:15:33.902 --> 00:15:37.271
- Hey, hun, do you
have a business card?

335
00:15:38.405 --> 00:15:39.306
- Yeah.

336
00:15:40.941 --> 00:15:42.142
- My brother's
down in Walla Walla

337
00:15:42.176 --> 00:15:44.344
and he's PD officer
is fucking useless

338
00:15:44.378 --> 00:15:46.046
and I hear you're
a big shot fixer,

339
00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:48.949
so I may need some
of your services.

340
00:15:48.982 --> 00:15:51.018
- But we don't do criminal law.

341
00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:52.352
- I was talking to him.

342
00:15:53.755 --> 00:15:56.423
- Um, no criminal law, really?

343
00:15:56.457 --> 00:15:59.259
- No, we're real
estate attorneys.

344
00:15:59.293 --> 00:16:00.728
- Ah.
- Just real estate.

345
00:16:00.762 --> 00:16:02.029
- Such a bummer.

346
00:16:04.064 --> 00:16:06.400
Can I keep your card anyways?

347
00:16:06.433 --> 00:16:07.301
- Yeah, go ahead.

348
00:16:08.335 --> 00:16:11.405
Do whatever you want with it.

349
00:16:11.438 --> 00:16:12.139
- See ya.

350
00:16:14.141 --> 00:16:16.376
- Who was that?

351
00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:17.978
- I have no idea.

352
00:16:18.847 --> 00:16:20.280
That was just weird, right?

353
00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:23.050
You know what?

354
00:16:24.351 --> 00:16:25.954
She was sitting at that table
where my brother was at.

355
00:16:26.019 --> 00:16:28.222
And-
- Your brother?

356
00:16:28.255 --> 00:16:30.023
- He's not there anymore.

357
00:16:30.057 --> 00:16:32.760
(traffic humming)

358
00:16:33.928 --> 00:16:35.128
- How was your weekend?

359
00:16:36.698 --> 00:16:37.765
- Boring.

360
00:16:37.799 --> 00:16:40.300
- You think
everything is boring.

361
00:16:40.334 --> 00:16:41.034
- Isn't it?

362
00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:44.004
- Yeah, what's you cats do?

363
00:16:45.405 --> 00:16:46.106
- Nothing.

364
00:16:48.408 --> 00:16:51.378
- Come on, I haven't seen
you guys for three days.

365
00:16:51.411 --> 00:16:53.815
- We watched that
movie last night.

366
00:16:53.848 --> 00:16:56.016
- Yeah, but you
wouldn't like it, Dad.

367
00:16:56.049 --> 00:16:58.920
It had a happy ending.

368
00:16:58.953 --> 00:17:00.187
- Can I go to Japan?

369
00:17:01.823 --> 00:17:02.790
- You fucking with me.

370
00:17:04.091 --> 00:17:06.260
- Listen, I, I got
it all figured out.

371
00:17:06.293 --> 00:17:08.897
Tickets, trains, where to stay.

372
00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.632
I got money.

373
00:17:10.665 --> 00:17:12.032
I, I saved it from working

374
00:17:12.065 --> 00:17:14.468
at the farmer's
market on weekends.

375
00:17:14.502 --> 00:17:16.004
I just need help with
the plane ticket,

376
00:17:16.036 --> 00:17:18.105
but I could pay for the
most of the trip myself.

377
00:17:18.973 --> 00:17:20.173
- I'll talk to grandma.

378
00:17:21.809 --> 00:17:23.243
Maybe she could pay for it.

379
00:17:25.813 --> 00:17:27.782
- Wait, I wanna go to Japan too.

380
00:17:29.283 --> 00:17:31.051
- No, no, no, you're
you're not going with me.

381
00:17:31.084 --> 00:17:32.319
- Why not?

382
00:17:32.352 --> 00:17:33.888
- Because you're annoying.

383
00:17:33.922 --> 00:17:36.123
- How come always
gets what he wants?

384
00:17:36.156 --> 00:17:37.659
- God, you're such
a whiny little shit.

385
00:17:37.692 --> 00:17:38.560
- And you're a dick.

386
00:17:38.593 --> 00:17:40.394
- Hey, hey, hey.

387
00:17:40.427 --> 00:17:41.128
All right.

388
00:17:42.564 --> 00:17:43.363
Quit your bitching.

389
00:17:51.539 --> 00:17:54.074
(phone ringing)

390
00:17:57.912 --> 00:18:00.447
- Jerry, what the
hell was that, huh?

391
00:18:01.716 --> 00:18:02.617
Jerry?

392
00:18:04.786 --> 00:18:05.720
Jerry, you there?

393
00:18:07.555 --> 00:18:08.556
Hey man.

394
00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:11.124
(ominous music)

395
00:18:13.061 --> 00:18:16.129
Jerry, can you hear me?

396
00:18:20.635 --> 00:18:23.370
(siren wailing)

397
00:18:24.572 --> 00:18:27.441
(suspenseful music)

398
00:18:31.546 --> 00:18:33.146
He'll call back.

399
00:18:33.881 --> 00:18:36.618
(ominous music)

400
00:18:46.728 --> 00:18:48.495
(computer ringing)

401
00:18:48.529 --> 00:18:49.597
- Hi.

402
00:18:49.631 --> 00:18:51.032
- [Max] Hey.

403
00:18:51.065 --> 00:18:52.800
- I thought you
would be home soon.

404
00:18:52.834 --> 00:18:54.468
- I know, I know, I'm sorry.

405
00:18:54.502 --> 00:18:56.370
Is she asleep?

406
00:18:56.403 --> 00:18:58.205
- Yeah, she's
sleeping after a bath.

407
00:18:58.238 --> 00:18:59.774
She was just out like a light.

408
00:18:59.807 --> 00:19:01.475
- I think I'm gonna have to
pull another all nighter.

409
00:19:01.509 --> 00:19:04.545
This presentation I gotta
do it at 9:00 AM tomorrow

410
00:19:04.579 --> 00:19:06.114
and it's just.

411
00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:08.315
- (scoffs) Again.

412
00:19:08.348 --> 00:19:11.284
- Hey, you didn't tell Ari
about our trip, did you?

413
00:19:11.318 --> 00:19:13.487
- [Susan] No, of course not.

414
00:19:13.521 --> 00:19:14.388
- Good, good.

415
00:19:14.421 --> 00:19:16.691
(tense ominous music)
(Max groans)

416
00:19:16.724 --> 00:19:17.959
- Was that a brain zap?

417
00:19:17.992 --> 00:19:19.127
- [Max] Mm-hmm.

418
00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:22.597
- [Susan] Are you gonna be okay?

419
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:24.899
(Max groans)

420
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.334
- Oh, man.

421
00:19:27.367 --> 00:19:28.936
- But you have your
pills on you, right?

422
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:31.338
- [Max] (sighs) No.

423
00:19:31.371 --> 00:19:34.241
I, I didn't think I was
gonna stay here this long.

424
00:19:35.475 --> 00:19:36.476
- Max.

425
00:19:36.511 --> 00:19:38.211
- I know, I know,
I know, I know.

426
00:19:38.245 --> 00:19:40.515
I promise I'll take them as
soon as I get home tomorrow.

427
00:19:40.548 --> 00:19:42.517
- [Susan] And when will that be?

428
00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:44.217
- Before noon.

429
00:19:44.251 --> 00:19:46.754
And then it's straight family
quality time, I promise.

430
00:19:46.788 --> 00:19:48.556
- Okay, bye baby.

431
00:19:48.589 --> 00:19:49.590
- [Max] Love you.

432
00:19:49.624 --> 00:19:50.490
See you soon.

433
00:19:55.328 --> 00:19:58.331
(doorbell buzzing)

434
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:03.671
(button clicks)

435
00:20:03.705 --> 00:20:05.272
- Yeah.

436
00:20:05.305 --> 00:20:07.775
- [Jerry] Hey, it's Jerry.

437
00:20:07.809 --> 00:20:09.944
Can I, can I come in?

438
00:20:10.978 --> 00:20:13.014
- Yeah, Jerry, come up.

439
00:20:13.047 --> 00:20:13.948
I'm buzzing you in.

440
00:20:13.981 --> 00:20:16.718
(buzzer buzzes)

441
00:20:24.926 --> 00:20:25.960
- [Ari] Mommy.

442
00:20:27.729 --> 00:20:30.164
- What are you
doing up right now?

443
00:20:30.198 --> 00:20:32.499
You're supposed to be
sleeping, aren't you sleepy?

444
00:20:32.533 --> 00:20:33.233
- Uh-uh.

445
00:20:33.266 --> 00:20:35.235
- Okay, Jerry, come up.

446
00:20:35.268 --> 00:20:36.504
Your Uncle Jerry's stopping by.

447
00:20:36.537 --> 00:20:38.472
You can say hi then
back to bed, okay?

448
00:20:40.108 --> 00:20:42.342
(ominous music)

449
00:20:42.375 --> 00:20:45.445
(Jerry whimpering)

450
00:20:52.053 --> 00:20:52.954
- I'm so sorry.

451
00:20:54.122 --> 00:20:54.989
I am.

452
00:20:55.022 --> 00:20:57.725
- Oh my God, Jerry.

453
00:20:57.759 --> 00:20:59.927
(footsteps tapping)

454
00:20:59.961 --> 00:21:02.597
(suspenseful music)

455
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:05.432
(brooding music)

456
00:21:09.402 --> 00:21:11.404
- Even if the PUD had expired,

457
00:21:11.438 --> 00:21:13.473
the regular zoning
laws and fire codes

458
00:21:13.508 --> 00:21:16.309
would not allow the complex
to be built next to the mall.

459
00:21:16.343 --> 00:21:17.845
And from what I've been hearing,

460
00:21:17.879 --> 00:21:19.080
there's a lot of talk

461
00:21:19.113 --> 00:21:20.214
about putting in a
dog park next to us.

462
00:21:20.248 --> 00:21:22.517
So as far as I'm concerned,

463
00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:23.951
Jean, I'm in a meeting.

464
00:21:27.588 --> 00:21:30.725
- Max Kelly, Detective Santiago.

465
00:21:31.626 --> 00:21:33.027
Can I have a word with you?

466
00:21:33.995 --> 00:21:35.897
- Oh, Jean, one minute please.

467
00:21:37.297 --> 00:21:38.166
What's this about?

468
00:21:38.199 --> 00:21:39.299
- Outside.

469
00:21:40.968 --> 00:21:43.771
(dramatic music)

470
00:21:44.739 --> 00:21:46.874
- [Susan] You forgot
it was early out today.

471
00:21:47.842 --> 00:21:49.342
Do you wanna talk to her?

472
00:21:49.376 --> 00:21:51.579
She might be willing
to forgive you.

473
00:21:53.181 --> 00:21:54.849
- [Ari] Hi, daddy.

474
00:21:55.516 --> 00:21:57.652
Nah, I knew you forgot.

475
00:21:57.685 --> 00:21:58.719
I'm drawing.

476
00:21:58.753 --> 00:22:00.922
Are you coming to my
cheerleading practice?

477
00:22:00.955 --> 00:22:04.424
You're always working.

478
00:22:04.457 --> 00:22:05.860
Okay, bye daddy.

479
00:22:10.463 --> 00:22:12.800
(group chattering)

480
00:22:12.834 --> 00:22:14.334
- Thank you, Kristy.

481
00:22:15.368 --> 00:22:16.070
Thank you.

482
00:22:17.238 --> 00:22:18.606
Corner's preliminary.

483
00:22:19.372 --> 00:22:20.373
- It's about time.

484
00:22:23.144 --> 00:22:25.980
- Victim one, Dr. Susan Kelly.

485
00:22:26.013 --> 00:22:27.480
Multiple stab wounds.

486
00:22:27.515 --> 00:22:31.351
Second victim was FBI
agent Gerald Kelly.

487
00:22:31.384 --> 00:22:34.021
This guy's brother,
multiple stab wounds,

488
00:22:34.055 --> 00:22:35.923
couple of missing fingers,

489
00:22:35.957 --> 00:22:39.560
other fingers had paper clips
inserted under their nails.

490
00:22:41.729 --> 00:22:44.532
- [Vasquez] This looks
pretty black and white to me.

491
00:22:44.565 --> 00:22:46.433
Daddy comes home early,

492
00:22:46.466 --> 00:22:48.870
finds mommy with the
brother going at it.

493
00:22:48.903 --> 00:22:50.638
It's a crime of passion.

494
00:22:53.307 --> 00:22:56.944
- What we have is
a dead FBI agent.

495
00:22:56.978 --> 00:22:59.347
The feds are gonna take
this over in a heartbeat.

496
00:22:59.379 --> 00:23:00.548
So we've gotta get
outta their way

497
00:23:00.581 --> 00:23:01.983
and focus on finding that child

498
00:23:02.016 --> 00:23:04.118
while we still have
any jurisdiction left.

499
00:23:04.151 --> 00:23:05.485
- This guy's clean.

500
00:23:05.519 --> 00:23:07.822
Someone murdered his family

501
00:23:07.855 --> 00:23:09.523
so why don't we
cut him some slack

502
00:23:09.557 --> 00:23:12.560
and uh, think about it, it
could be one of us in there.

503
00:23:15.763 --> 00:23:18.833
- [Vasquez] How can you
be so sure it wasn't him?

504
00:23:19.901 --> 00:23:22.103
- Because I'm a very
good judge of character.

505
00:23:22.136 --> 00:23:24.372
(Daniels scoffs)

506
00:23:24.404 --> 00:23:25.706
What?

507
00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:27.407
- Let's just say good judgment's

508
00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.010
not the first thing
that pops into my head

509
00:23:29.043 --> 00:23:30.745
when I see your pretty face.

510
00:23:32.046 --> 00:23:33.981
- Oh, you wanna go there?

511
00:23:34.015 --> 00:23:35.616
- No.

512
00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:37.184
- I want you to go in
there and talk to this man.

513
00:23:38.219 --> 00:23:41.055
- This guy and I
sat for 12 years

514
00:23:41.088 --> 00:23:42.957
in the same black and white.

515
00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:45.126
We had a coffee together,
had lunch together.

516
00:23:46.426 --> 00:23:49.563
Look at him now, the
big fucking boss.

517
00:23:52.033 --> 00:23:52.934
Sure.

518
00:23:58.406 --> 00:24:00.875
(Daniels sighs)

519
00:24:00.908 --> 00:24:03.010
- Takes a few decades
to get to know him.

520
00:24:05.212 --> 00:24:08.649
(brooding music)

521
00:24:08.683 --> 00:24:11.652
- You and your
brother got arrested

522
00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.822
drifting cars in
the parking lot.

523
00:24:16.223 --> 00:24:17.191
The abandoned steam plant.

524
00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:20.795
Joined the Navy.

525
00:24:23.331 --> 00:24:24.464
What happened to you?

526
00:24:26.133 --> 00:24:27.134
Dishonorable discharge.

527
00:24:30.137 --> 00:24:31.072
- It's complicated.

528
00:24:34.108 --> 00:24:35.242
- It always is, isn't it?

529
00:24:44.452 --> 00:24:48.522
Your brother, Agent Kelly
called you at 9:00 PM,

530
00:24:50.091 --> 00:24:51.125
what he'd want?

531
00:24:51.158 --> 00:24:53.527
- I don't know, all right.

532
00:24:53.561 --> 00:24:55.896
He called me, I
couldn't hear anything.

533
00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:58.165
Thought he'd call me
back, but he never did.

534
00:24:59.333 --> 00:25:00.434
- And when you saw
him at the restaurant,

535
00:25:00.468 --> 00:25:02.103
did you recognize
anybody was with him?

536
00:25:02.136 --> 00:25:03.537
- No.

537
00:25:03.571 --> 00:25:05.039
I didn't recognize
anyone with him.

538
00:25:06.273 --> 00:25:07.675
Have you found my daughter yet?

539
00:25:10.211 --> 00:25:11.645
- We're knocking on every door.

540
00:25:13.481 --> 00:25:15.116
We're also searching
all over Discovery Park

541
00:25:15.149 --> 00:25:16.684
an Lincoln Park.

542
00:25:16.717 --> 00:25:19.720
We have to plan for
any possible scenario.

543
00:25:23.891 --> 00:25:25.893
Look, I got two kids of my own,

544
00:25:25.926 --> 00:25:28.996
so it could be me
in your situation.

545
00:25:30.765 --> 00:25:32.900
Trust me when I
tell you that I'm,

546
00:25:32.933 --> 00:25:34.602
I care and I'm
gonna do everything

547
00:25:34.635 --> 00:25:36.303
I can to find your daughter.

548
00:25:48.049 --> 00:25:48.983
- What are they like?

549
00:25:50.885 --> 00:25:51.786
- Who?

550
00:25:53.454 --> 00:25:54.722
- Your, your kids?

551
00:25:59.193 --> 00:26:00.227
- (sighs) I don't know.

552
00:26:01.829 --> 00:26:03.597
Typical teenagers, I guess.

553
00:26:06.567 --> 00:26:07.968
Don't get to see them much.

554
00:26:10.638 --> 00:26:11.739
Probably my fault.

555
00:26:13.574 --> 00:26:15.042
Having trouble with the Mrs.

556
00:26:17.878 --> 00:26:22.750
But when we're together, it's
all, all good quality time.

557
00:26:27.321 --> 00:26:30.057
- Should have been all quantity.

558
00:26:31.125 --> 00:26:31.892
- [Santiago] What?

559
00:26:34.762 --> 00:26:38.933
- Any time you spend with
your child is quality time.

560
00:26:41.503 --> 00:26:44.338
What would you do
if you were me?

561
00:26:46.907 --> 00:26:48.375
- [Santiago] How do you mean?

562
00:26:50.678 --> 00:26:53.647
- If you found out
someone murdered,

563
00:26:53.681 --> 00:26:58.652
murdered your whole
family, what would you do?

564
00:27:01.122 --> 00:27:05.326
- Oh, uh, buddy, I'm,
I'm the wrong guy to ask.

565
00:27:06.293 --> 00:27:10.164
- What would you do?

566
00:27:12.199 --> 00:27:14.034
- Well

567
00:27:18.139 --> 00:27:19.740
I'm a simple man

568
00:27:21.675 --> 00:27:25.679
and so I probably would
put them on a chair.

569
00:27:27.148 --> 00:27:28.115
- Oh, shit.

570
00:27:31.952 --> 00:27:35.789
- And then I would wack them
with one of them nail bats.

571
00:27:37.024 --> 00:27:38.359
You know, the ones
with the nails

572
00:27:38.392 --> 00:27:40.027
and the barbed wire all over.

573
00:27:43.998 --> 00:27:46.700
Then I would swing
until my arms fell off.

574
00:27:48.102 --> 00:27:49.504
I can't even think
about that shit

575
00:27:49.538 --> 00:27:52.106
without getting my
fucking blood boiling.

576
00:27:52.139 --> 00:27:56.210
But fucking monsters
don't get a second chance

577
00:27:58.345 --> 00:28:00.147
because they will do it again.

578
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:04.586
(door clicks)

579
00:28:04.619 --> 00:28:07.421
(door bangs)

580
00:28:07.454 --> 00:28:08.657
- [Daniels] Detective Santiago,

581
00:28:08.689 --> 00:28:10.424
may I have a word with
you outside please.

582
00:28:20.669 --> 00:28:22.770
Mr. Kelly, I'm so
sorry about that.

583
00:28:22.803 --> 00:28:26.173
That is not a reflection on
this department in any way.

584
00:28:26.207 --> 00:28:28.342
- [Max] Look, I can't
sit here anymore.

585
00:28:28.375 --> 00:28:29.511
- Well, you can't go home.

586
00:28:29.544 --> 00:28:31.779
Your house is a crime
scene right now.

587
00:28:31.812 --> 00:28:33.781
You'd be better off
staying here with us.

588
00:28:34.616 --> 00:28:35.716
- Am I free to go?

589
00:28:37.017 --> 00:28:39.386
- [Daniels] Yes,
of course you are.

590
00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:40.955
Where are you going?

591
00:28:42.756 --> 00:28:45.492
(ominous music)

592
00:28:46.794 --> 00:28:51.398
(birds chirping)
(group chattering)

593
00:28:52.299 --> 00:28:54.768
(Max crying)

594
00:29:05.513 --> 00:29:08.249
(ominous music)

595
00:29:41.215 --> 00:29:43.484
(Max crying)

596
00:29:51.859 --> 00:29:54.395
(suspenseful music)

597
00:29:54.428 --> 00:29:56.665
- Don't make a fucking sound.

598
00:29:56.698 --> 00:29:57.898
(Max grunts)
(elbow thuds)

599
00:29:57.931 --> 00:29:59.567
(elbow thuds)
(Big John groans)

600
00:29:59.601 --> 00:30:00.535
(Max grunts)

601
00:30:00.568 --> 00:30:01.736
(body thuds)

602
00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:03.037
- Who the fuck are you?

603
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:04.506
- I'm Jerry's friend.

604
00:30:04.539 --> 00:30:05.640
- What are you doing here?

605
00:30:05.674 --> 00:30:06.807
- Had no place to go.

606
00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:09.877
- What's in the bag?

607
00:30:12.714 --> 00:30:14.516
- [Big John] Take it.

608
00:30:31.131 --> 00:30:33.535
- What the fuck you
doing with an M68?

609
00:30:34.835 --> 00:30:36.970
- I just carrying them
with me for good luck.

610
00:30:37.004 --> 00:30:40.575
You know, as in I never know
when I'm gonna need good luck.

611
00:30:42.109 --> 00:30:44.044
Kind of like a
condom in my pocket.

612
00:30:44.779 --> 00:30:45.680
Oh, Jerry told me to give you-

613
00:30:45.714 --> 00:30:47.214
- Hey, hey, hey.

614
00:30:52.186 --> 00:30:54.121
- Jerry said, "If
anything happened to him

615
00:30:54.154 --> 00:30:55.856
give 'em only to you."

616
00:30:55.889 --> 00:30:58.325
Jerry had a bad feeling

617
00:30:58.359 --> 00:31:00.961
when Ellis suddenly
changed the plans.

618
00:31:00.994 --> 00:31:02.630
- What, what plan?

619
00:31:04.198 --> 00:31:06.066
Look man, I don't understand
what you're talking about.

620
00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.102
- What the fuck you
don't understand?

621
00:31:08.135 --> 00:31:10.572
We all in this shit
because of you bitch.

622
00:31:10.605 --> 00:31:11.773
- What are you talking about?

623
00:31:11.806 --> 00:31:13.907
- You blew his fucking cover.

624
00:31:13.941 --> 00:31:15.943
He was working his
way into the crew.

625
00:31:15.976 --> 00:31:18.879
Everything was going fine
till your dumb ass showed up.

626
00:31:18.912 --> 00:31:21.649
(ominous music)

627
00:31:23.718 --> 00:31:25.319
- It's been about
over a half hour.

628
00:31:30.491 --> 00:31:31.458
Should I bring him in?

629
00:31:33.628 --> 00:31:34.529
Okay.

630
00:31:36.063 --> 00:31:40.134
- The firm traffics human
organs, hearts, livers, kidneys.

631
00:31:41.268 --> 00:31:42.737
They dice up little kids
and sell 'em like parts

632
00:31:42.771 --> 00:31:44.839
for like a fucking
Toyota truck, man.

633
00:31:44.873 --> 00:31:46.708
We used to sell guns
for the cartels,

634
00:31:46.741 --> 00:31:48.543
but the cut up kids for money,

635
00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:51.579
that shit ain't Christian yo.

636
00:31:51.613 --> 00:31:52.614
(knuckles tapping)

637
00:31:52.647 --> 00:31:53.447
- [Vasquez] Mr. Kelly.

638
00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:54.682
It's Detective Vasquez.

639
00:31:55.784 --> 00:31:57.351
- Fuck!
- She's a cop.

640
00:31:57.384 --> 00:31:58.419
She can help us.

641
00:31:58.452 --> 00:32:01.121
Look, I'm looking for
my daughter, all right?

642
00:32:01.155 --> 00:32:03.825
So you're gonna tell her
everything you just told me.

643
00:32:03.858 --> 00:32:04.726
- We can't, man.

644
00:32:04.759 --> 00:32:05.593
We can't.

645
00:32:05.627 --> 00:32:07.127
- [Max] Why?

646
00:32:07.161 --> 00:32:08.696
- Because she's one of them.

647
00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:10.130
(knuckles tapping)

648
00:32:10.164 --> 00:32:13.000
- [Vasquez] Mr. Kelly, you're
not supposed to be here.

649
00:32:13.601 --> 00:32:14.401
- You best leave, man.

650
00:32:14.435 --> 00:32:15.570
I'll take care of her.

651
00:32:16.604 --> 00:32:17.938
Go!

652
00:32:17.971 --> 00:32:21.041
(suspenseful music)

653
00:32:26.881 --> 00:32:29.751
(door clicks)

654
00:32:29.784 --> 00:32:32.654
(footsteps tapping)

655
00:32:42.897 --> 00:32:44.498
- No fucking way.

656
00:32:46.568 --> 00:32:47.802
What the fuck happened?

657
00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:50.204
- Basically, guy beat
the shit outta me.

658
00:32:50.237 --> 00:32:52.072
Ran out through the fire escape.

659
00:32:52.105 --> 00:32:54.208
- Everyone's looking for you.

660
00:32:54.241 --> 00:32:55.476
- I know.

661
00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:58.580
I came looking for the
cash to bring it to Ellis.

662
00:32:58.613 --> 00:33:00.113
- Oh really?

663
00:33:00.147 --> 00:33:02.483
(gun banging)
(Big John groans)

664
00:33:02.517 --> 00:33:07.589
(Big John gurgling)
(ominous music)

665
00:33:16.497 --> 00:33:18.999
Where is the money?

666
00:33:19.032 --> 00:33:24.004
- (chuckles) Get you on
the other side, bitch.

667
00:33:25.239 --> 00:33:26.975
(suspenseful music)
(grenade thuds)

668
00:33:27.007 --> 00:33:27.976
- Oh fuck!

669
00:33:28.008 --> 00:33:30.512
(explosion booming)

670
00:33:30.545 --> 00:33:33.413
(car alarm wailing)

671
00:33:34.582 --> 00:33:35.550
- Oh, shit.

672
00:33:38.151 --> 00:33:41.221
(suspenseful music)

673
00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:59.774
(brooding music)

674
00:34:10.618 --> 00:34:13.688
(melancholic music)

675
00:34:59.567 --> 00:35:01.970
(brooding music)

676
00:35:02.003 --> 00:35:05.172
(seagulls squawking)

677
00:35:09.644 --> 00:35:12.714
(suspenseful music)

678
00:35:25.593 --> 00:35:26.761
(keys clicking)

679
00:35:26.794 --> 00:35:30.163
(high pitched tone)

680
00:35:30.197 --> 00:35:32.834
(Max groaning)

681
00:35:34.736 --> 00:35:37.237
(body thuds)

682
00:35:40.041 --> 00:35:42.510
(Max groans)

683
00:36:03.598 --> 00:36:05.332
(birds chirping)

684
00:36:05.365 --> 00:36:08.368
(group chattering)

685
00:36:08.402 --> 00:36:09.637
(door clicks)
(body thuds)

686
00:36:09.671 --> 00:36:12.573
(Santiago grunts)

687
00:36:19.647 --> 00:36:20.815
- What is this?

688
00:36:20.848 --> 00:36:23.383
- That is $50,000 in cash.

689
00:36:23.417 --> 00:36:26.788
We found that in Detective
Vasquez's apartment last night.

690
00:36:26.821 --> 00:36:27.889
That and a pound of blow.

691
00:36:32.727 --> 00:36:33.628
She was your partner.

692
00:36:39.567 --> 00:36:42.269
(Santiago sighs)

693
00:36:42.302 --> 00:36:44.105
- Feel free to check my
apartment and you find anything,

694
00:36:44.138 --> 00:36:46.239
you know, give half to Hanna

695
00:36:46.273 --> 00:36:48.275
because I'm fucking
behind on rent.

696
00:36:51.145 --> 00:36:52.714
- Didn't I tell you
the Max Kelly case

697
00:36:52.747 --> 00:36:53.715
was with the Feds now?

698
00:36:55.049 --> 00:36:57.284
- You certainly made a point
to mention something equivalent

699
00:36:57.317 --> 00:36:58.285
to that statement.

700
00:37:04.826 --> 00:37:09.664
- [Daniels] Max Kelly's
military records, roadside bomb.

701
00:37:11.132 --> 00:37:14.936
Only survivor, head
trauma, and PTSD.

702
00:37:16.504 --> 00:37:18.573
He spent a couple of years
in Massachusetts recovering

703
00:37:18.606 --> 00:37:20.273
so who knows?

704
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:29.851
- So that's it?

705
00:37:31.619 --> 00:37:33.855
- They closed the case
as a murder suicide.

706
00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:36.958
- Don't make any sense.

707
00:37:38.226 --> 00:37:40.494
- Focus on finding
those kids, would you?

708
00:37:40.528 --> 00:37:41.562
- Right.

709
00:37:41.596 --> 00:37:42.630
Okie dokie.

710
00:37:46.934 --> 00:37:50.104
- Santi, if I find out
you're dirty, I swear to God,

711
00:37:50.138 --> 00:37:51.939
I'll put a fucking
bullet in your head.

712
00:37:55.308 --> 00:37:56.010
- Sounds fair.

713
00:38:01.249 --> 00:38:05.318
(door thuds)
(Santiago groans)

714
00:38:05.352 --> 00:38:10.024
(traffic humming)
(birds chirping)

715
00:38:10.892 --> 00:38:13.561
(group chattering)

716
00:38:18.331 --> 00:38:20.835
- (sighs) When's
he gonna get here?

717
00:38:22.937 --> 00:38:26.073
- Let me just wrap this up
and I will be right with you.

718
00:38:27.975 --> 00:38:30.645
- I'm here to meet with Mr.
Tank, not his secretary.

719
00:38:37.585 --> 00:38:40.955
- I understand it's unusual
to go by different pronouns,

720
00:38:40.988 --> 00:38:44.525
but I prefer the mister as it
seems to be less disruptive

721
00:38:44.559 --> 00:38:46.561
for official business.

722
00:38:48.029 --> 00:38:49.096
- You're Mr. Tank.

723
00:38:50.898 --> 00:38:52.533
- It's a man's world.

724
00:38:52.567 --> 00:38:54.035
The fact that you assumed

725
00:38:54.068 --> 00:38:56.904
I wasn't a person worthy
of power proves my point.

726
00:39:00.074 --> 00:39:01.108
- And why meet here?

727
00:39:02.677 --> 00:39:05.313
- I believe it is better to
meet in a friendly environment

728
00:39:05.345 --> 00:39:08.282
where you and I can feel
safe and comfortable

729
00:39:08.316 --> 00:39:09.517
to speak openly.

730
00:39:10.383 --> 00:39:11.085
Don't you agree?

731
00:39:13.754 --> 00:39:14.655
- And who's he?

732
00:39:16.224 --> 00:39:20.427
- That is Kevin, my assistant.

733
00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:22.029
May I offer you a latte?

734
00:39:22.897 --> 00:39:24.431
Come on, blend in.

735
00:39:24.464 --> 00:39:25.933
Do you like milk in your coffee?

736
00:39:25.967 --> 00:39:27.268
Do you like it sweet?

737
00:39:27.301 --> 00:39:28.536
- I'm fine.

738
00:39:28.569 --> 00:39:31.672
- Can you please get him
a half-caf vanilla latte

739
00:39:31.706 --> 00:39:34.709
with six pumps of vanilla
and whipped cream on top?

740
00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:40.147
Make sure you use the app
so I can redeem my points.

741
00:39:47.054 --> 00:39:50.390
You receive a very fair
fee for your services,

742
00:39:50.423 --> 00:39:52.793
and over time you
have been considered

743
00:39:52.827 --> 00:39:55.162
to be a valuable
asset to the firm.

744
00:39:56.797 --> 00:39:59.967
May I ask how it is
that you ended up

745
00:40:00.001 --> 00:40:03.905
with an FBI agent
infiltrating your team?

746
00:40:03.938 --> 00:40:05.907
- He came from a
very reliable source.

747
00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:08.209
- And where's this
reliable source now?

748
00:40:08.242 --> 00:40:10.111
- That's been taken care of.

749
00:40:10.144 --> 00:40:11.279
- [Mr. Tank] And the FBI agent?

750
00:40:11.312 --> 00:40:12.813
- That's been
taken care of also.

751
00:40:14.348 --> 00:40:15.182
- And the currency?

752
00:40:17.251 --> 00:40:18.418
- I'm working on that.

753
00:40:24.424 --> 00:40:26.827
- Based on what has
transgressed here,

754
00:40:26.861 --> 00:40:29.897
I'm left with two
possible conclusions.

755
00:40:29.931 --> 00:40:34.335
One is that your judgment
is no longer reliable,

756
00:40:34.368 --> 00:40:37.437
which in our business
is not a good virtue

757
00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:40.808
or two, that you
were somehow involved

758
00:40:40.841 --> 00:40:43.010
in an elaborate piece of fiction

759
00:40:43.044 --> 00:40:46.681
in order to bamboozle the
firm for your last demotion.

760
00:40:46.714 --> 00:40:49.583
I know, I know, it's a
ridiculous speculation.

761
00:40:49.617 --> 00:40:52.485
And what you have done for
the firm over the years

762
00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:54.855
has been taken into account

763
00:40:54.889 --> 00:40:59.126
and it has gotten you
a one time courtesy.

764
00:41:00.828 --> 00:41:03.664
I trust you will
rectify the situation.

765
00:41:03.698 --> 00:41:08.402
Neither you, the firm,
myself, nor Kevin here,

766
00:41:08.436 --> 00:41:12.472
wish this issue to go
in any other direction.

767
00:41:18.746 --> 00:41:22.216
I understand you used to run
weapons to the Mexican cartels.

768
00:41:23.884 --> 00:41:24.585
- Yes.

769
00:41:28.923 --> 00:41:31.726
(brooding music)

770
00:41:33.294 --> 00:41:35.096
I'm very good at what I do.

771
00:41:35.129 --> 00:41:37.497
- And yet here I am.

772
00:41:39.066 --> 00:41:40.201
And there you are.

773
00:41:41.501 --> 00:41:44.538
Now go do your
job, you old cunt.

774
00:41:47.508 --> 00:41:50.544
(ominous music)

775
00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:01.222
(door clicks)

776
00:42:01.255 --> 00:42:03.424
(suspenseful music)

777
00:42:03.457 --> 00:42:04.592
(door bangs)

778
00:42:04.625 --> 00:42:08.963
(high pitched tone)
(Max groaning)

779
00:42:08.996 --> 00:42:11.232
(Max groaning)

780
00:42:14.268 --> 00:42:16.904
(Max groaning)

781
00:42:26.013 --> 00:42:28.549
(suspenseful music)

782
00:42:28.582 --> 00:42:31.252
(Max groaning)

783
00:42:41.462 --> 00:42:44.265
(dramatic music)

784
00:43:07.088 --> 00:43:10.291
(birds chirping)

785
00:43:10.324 --> 00:43:13.661
(seagulls squawking)

786
00:43:17.665 --> 00:43:21.635
(fast tempo suspenseful music)

787
00:43:28.342 --> 00:43:31.078
(tool whirring)

788
00:43:35.249 --> 00:43:37.985
(tool whirring)

789
00:43:40.555 --> 00:43:45.626
(Max grunting)
(knives thudding)

790
00:43:48.095 --> 00:43:51.632
(birds chirping)
(traffic humming)

791
00:43:51.665 --> 00:43:54.368
- Hey dad, when are
you gonna move back in?

792
00:43:57.338 --> 00:43:58.806
- [Santiago] I don't know, son.

793
00:43:58.839 --> 00:44:01.942
- [Ray] Well, I'm just saying
you better think of something.

794
00:44:04.945 --> 00:44:05.646
- Why?

795
00:44:10.084 --> 00:44:11.685
- I think mom's got
a new boyfriend.

796
00:44:11.719 --> 00:44:12.953
- Jesus, Ray.

797
00:44:12.987 --> 00:44:13.888
Shut up.

798
00:44:14.855 --> 00:44:16.257
- Kenny something.

799
00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:18.159
She was telling
grandma on the phone.

800
00:44:20.161 --> 00:44:22.429
- Mom just said, "He was
nice to her from work."

801
00:44:23.731 --> 00:44:25.634
I guess he likes her
and gave her flowers.

802
00:44:25.666 --> 00:44:29.236
- See, Dad, how come you
never bring mom flowers?

803
00:44:30.337 --> 00:44:32.173
- Why do you always
like to stir the pot?

804
00:44:41.516 --> 00:44:44.351
(birds chirping)

805
00:44:51.358 --> 00:44:53.127
(car horn honking)

806
00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:56.130
(car doors clicking)

807
00:44:58.332 --> 00:45:01.135
(car doors banging)

808
00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:06.774
- Love you, love you.

809
00:45:11.513 --> 00:45:13.214
- Hi.

810
00:45:13.247 --> 00:45:13.948
Be right there.

811
00:45:17.652 --> 00:45:18.819
Thanks for bringing them up.

812
00:45:18.852 --> 00:45:20.487
The ER was a combat zone today.

813
00:45:21.822 --> 00:45:24.024
- Yeah, yeah, no problem.

814
00:45:25.359 --> 00:45:27.361
- Do you know when I'll be
able to pay that hospital bill

815
00:45:27.394 --> 00:45:28.929
from Ray's thing?

816
00:45:28.963 --> 00:45:31.899
It's been a high 120 days and
it could go to collections.

817
00:45:32.967 --> 00:45:35.869
- I'm sorry, I, I
get paid on Thursday.

818
00:45:35.903 --> 00:45:37.672
Can waiting until them?

819
00:45:37.706 --> 00:45:38.806
- I think so.

820
00:45:41.175 --> 00:45:42.776
- How are you?

821
00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:43.844
- [Hanna] I'm fine.

822
00:45:46.747 --> 00:45:49.416
- Hey, I wanted to
ask you if I could,

823
00:45:50.451 --> 00:45:51.352
if we could sit down one day

824
00:45:51.385 --> 00:45:53.387
and talk about this whole thing.

825
00:45:54.288 --> 00:45:55.523
- What thing?

826
00:45:55.557 --> 00:45:57.592
We got several things.

827
00:45:57.626 --> 00:46:00.294
- I mean, this whole
separation thing.

828
00:46:00.327 --> 00:46:02.697
- (scoffs) If you
have time for a chat,

829
00:46:02.731 --> 00:46:04.566
have a chat with
our kids, would you?

830
00:46:04.599 --> 00:46:07.535
Because I can move on, but
these kids, they need a father.

831
00:46:08.502 --> 00:46:10.004
They didn't need all this drama

832
00:46:10.037 --> 00:46:12.507
you put them through so you
could fucking find yourself.

833
00:46:14.308 --> 00:46:15.276
They put on a good face,

834
00:46:15.309 --> 00:46:18.445
but you're gonna
break their hearts.

835
00:46:19.748 --> 00:46:21.081
And I can't afford
to get new ones.

836
00:46:22.182 --> 00:46:22.883
- What?

837
00:46:25.386 --> 00:46:26.287
- I gotta go.

838
00:46:34.028 --> 00:46:36.665
(fast tempo upbeat music)

839
00:46:36.698 --> 00:46:39.867
(group chattering)

840
00:47:18.339 --> 00:47:21.008
(Ellis grunts)

841
00:47:21.041 --> 00:47:25.412
- Mr. Ofstein, thank
you for meeting with me.

842
00:47:25.446 --> 00:47:26.514
How's young Michael?

843
00:47:27.414 --> 00:47:28.516
- Fine.

844
00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:29.718
Thank God.

845
00:47:29.751 --> 00:47:31.218
- [Ellis] Yeah,
that's good to hear.

846
00:47:31.251 --> 00:47:35.690
- It was my understanding that
our business had concluded.

847
00:47:35.724 --> 00:47:38.526
- Yes, we seem to have
one small problem.

848
00:47:40.227 --> 00:47:42.296
The man that you
delivered the money to,

849
00:47:43.397 --> 00:47:44.532
he was an FBI agent.

850
00:47:46.166 --> 00:47:48.603
- The money was
delivered to the person

851
00:47:48.636 --> 00:47:50.270
that you sent to collect.

852
00:47:50.304 --> 00:47:51.673
- This is true.

853
00:47:51.706 --> 00:47:55.610
But unfortunately for the both
of us, he was an FBI agent.

854
00:47:57.512 --> 00:47:58.546
- Are we all compromised?

855
00:47:58.580 --> 00:47:59.614
- No, no problem at all.

856
00:47:59.647 --> 00:48:00.948
I took care of everything,

857
00:48:00.981 --> 00:48:03.016
but unfortunately
the money is missing.

858
00:48:04.351 --> 00:48:06.855
So I'm gonna have to ask
you to make another deposit.

859
00:48:06.887 --> 00:48:08.288
- [Mr. Ofstein] How much?

860
00:48:08.322 --> 00:48:09.089
- The full amount.

861
00:48:10.224 --> 00:48:12.594
- What happens on your
end is your problem.

862
00:48:12.627 --> 00:48:13.795
- No, I'm sure young Michael

863
00:48:13.828 --> 00:48:15.597
is worth any amount
of money to you.

864
00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:16.230
- Are you threatening me?

865
00:48:16.263 --> 00:48:17.398
- [Ellis] No.

866
00:48:17.431 --> 00:48:18.499
No, not at all.

867
00:48:18.533 --> 00:48:19.400
- With all due, respect.

868
00:48:19.433 --> 00:48:20.267
- Respect?

869
00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:24.271
Now there's a fine word.

870
00:48:24.304 --> 00:48:25.372
Respect.

871
00:48:26.808 --> 00:48:28.576
Where would young
Michael be without me?

872
00:48:28.610 --> 00:48:30.010
I'll tell you where he'd be.

873
00:48:30.043 --> 00:48:31.979
He'd be dead and in the ground.

874
00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:35.082
And you stand here and
you thank God for that.

875
00:48:36.116 --> 00:48:37.519
How about thanking me?

876
00:48:38.352 --> 00:48:39.253
- Unbelievable.

877
00:48:40.588 --> 00:48:42.256
- [Ellis] What's that?

878
00:48:42.289 --> 00:48:45.560
- Your boss, Mr. Tank, she
said you might try this.

879
00:48:45.593 --> 00:48:47.094
How about we give her a call?

880
00:48:54.536 --> 00:48:56.403
Don't contact me ever again.

881
00:49:03.477 --> 00:49:04.945
- You motherfucker.

882
00:49:10.652 --> 00:49:11.653
Rich prick.

883
00:49:12.419 --> 00:49:13.555
Fucking shit!

884
00:49:14.622 --> 00:49:16.691
Goddamn rich motherfucker!

885
00:49:16.724 --> 00:49:18.459
(door bangs)
(upbeat music)

886
00:49:18.492 --> 00:49:19.694
Fuck, goddammit!

887
00:49:20.695 --> 00:49:22.029
Son of a bitch!

888
00:49:22.062 --> 00:49:23.898
No fucking respect!

889
00:49:23.932 --> 00:49:25.232
(Ellis yelling)

890
00:49:25.265 --> 00:49:27.468
- I'm gonna go check on
the boss, later boys.

891
00:49:27.501 --> 00:49:29.771
(Ellis yelling)

892
00:49:29.804 --> 00:49:31.438
(door banging)

893
00:49:31.472 --> 00:49:33.741
(man groaning)

894
00:49:33.775 --> 00:49:37.679
(door banging)
(man groaning)

895
00:49:37.712 --> 00:49:38.746
(man groaning)
(Ellis grunting)

896
00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:39.614
(door banging)

897
00:49:39.647 --> 00:49:41.549
- What a motherfucker!

898
00:49:42.717 --> 00:49:43.618
Shh.

899
00:49:50.224 --> 00:49:52.192
(traffic humming)
(car horn honking)

900
00:49:52.226 --> 00:49:55.462
(Keko singing gently)

901
00:49:58.131 --> 00:50:01.368
(Keko singing gently)

902
00:50:02.504 --> 00:50:04.606
(Rishi speaking in
foreign language)

903
00:50:04.639 --> 00:50:08.342
(suspenseful music)

904
00:50:08.375 --> 00:50:09.409
(dramatic music)

905
00:50:09.443 --> 00:50:12.212
(group chattering)

906
00:50:18.586 --> 00:50:20.788
- Captain!

907
00:50:20.822 --> 00:50:23.123
- [Daniels] Yeah.

908
00:50:23.156 --> 00:50:24.291
- Check this out.

909
00:50:24.324 --> 00:50:25.025
- Yeah.

910
00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:27.662
- So I was going through
all the kidnappings

911
00:50:27.695 --> 00:50:29.296
in the past eight months,

912
00:50:29.329 --> 00:50:31.331
and this just jumped out at me.

913
00:50:31.365 --> 00:50:33.066
Take a look at
all the addresses.

914
00:50:37.572 --> 00:50:39.473
- Okay, it's all
over the city, so?

915
00:50:41.208 --> 00:50:44.111
- Yeah, but they are
all shit neighborhoods.

916
00:50:44.144 --> 00:50:45.980
I noticed most of the
reports were filed by people

917
00:50:46.014 --> 00:50:48.750
with priors, tweakers,
people on SSI,

918
00:50:48.783 --> 00:50:51.051
welfare, foster parents.

919
00:50:51.084 --> 00:50:53.353
Then I took the medical
records for all children

920
00:50:53.387 --> 00:50:55.890
on the organ wait list
all over the state.

921
00:50:55.924 --> 00:50:57.357
And guess what?

922
00:50:57.391 --> 00:50:59.794
5% of them dropped
from the list.

923
00:50:59.827 --> 00:51:00.795
Dead you say?

924
00:51:00.828 --> 00:51:02.396
Far from it.

925
00:51:02.429 --> 00:51:03.998
Healthy as shit.

926
00:51:04.032 --> 00:51:07.167
But all kids are from
either wealthy people

927
00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:09.369
or people who recently
acquired a large debt

928
00:51:09.403 --> 00:51:12.139
or cashed out their retirement
funds or sold stock.

929
00:51:13.541 --> 00:51:15.442
- And you got warrants for
all these reports, right?

930
00:51:15.475 --> 00:51:16.476
- Listen to me.

931
00:51:18.078 --> 00:51:20.548
I think a lot of these
fucking shitty parents

932
00:51:20.582 --> 00:51:23.150
are selling their
babies for parts.

933
00:51:26.286 --> 00:51:27.689
- Organ trafficking.

934
00:51:27.722 --> 00:51:29.524
- Yaba doodles, big bear,

935
00:51:29.557 --> 00:51:31.291
body snatchers of
the third kind.

936
00:51:32.392 --> 00:51:34.261
- That's why nobody's
asked for a ransom.

937
00:51:35.563 --> 00:51:37.097

951
00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:14.401
Come on, get!

954
00:52:22.342 --> 00:52:25.445
Never, ever, ever
come to my house.

955
00:52:25.479 --> 00:52:27.180
- Sorry, boss.
- Take a chill pill, bro.

956
00:52:27.214 --> 00:52:28.248
- What did you say?

957
00:52:29.751 --> 00:52:32.587
Did he just tell me to
take a chill pill, bro?

958
00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:33.487
- Tommy is gone.

959
00:52:34.856 --> 00:52:37.091
When I got back there, the
joint was full of cops.

960
00:52:37.125 --> 00:52:38.392
They blocked off the
streets and everything.

961
00:52:38.425 --> 00:52:40.828
When I got back to your
car, this was on the seat.

962
00:52:40.862 --> 00:52:42.229
- [Roxy] Let me see this.

963
00:52:46.199 --> 00:52:48.368
- Jesus Christ, it's
8:30 in the morning.

964
00:52:48.402 --> 00:52:49.704
Give me your weed, idiot.

965
00:52:50.972 --> 00:52:52.172
Come on.

966
00:52:56.511 --> 00:52:57.310
Gimme that.

967
00:52:59.947 --> 00:53:01.248
- What are we gonna do, man?

968
00:53:03.216 --> 00:53:04.384
- [Ellis] Get your
feet off there.

969
00:53:04.418 --> 00:53:05.920
- Jesus, it's just a table.

970
00:53:05.953 --> 00:53:08.355
- It is not just a table.

971
00:53:08.388 --> 00:53:11.258
This is an original 1964

972
00:53:11.291 --> 00:53:14.862
one of a kind $10,000
Danish coffee table.

973
00:53:16.363 --> 00:53:18.198
- I thought you got it at Ikea.

974
00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:21.468
(Ellis laughs)

975
00:53:22.436 --> 00:53:25.139
- Okay, don't anybody move.

976
00:53:25.173 --> 00:53:27.374
And please don't touch anything.

977
00:53:29.110 --> 00:53:30.745
- [Keko] You're a
disrespectful asshole.

978
00:53:30.778 --> 00:53:31.746
- That was a good one.

979
00:53:31.779 --> 00:53:34.381
Guys, you gotta
chill the fuck out.

980
00:53:34.414 --> 00:53:36.383
- If you tell me to chill
the fuck out one more time.

981
00:53:36.416 --> 00:53:37.317
- Chill the fuck out.

982
00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:38.619
- [Roxy] All right, find out.

983
00:53:39.754 --> 00:53:41.055
(Rishi speaking in
foreign language)

984
00:53:41.089 --> 00:53:42.757
- Shut the fuck up, Rishi.

985
00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:43.925
(Pete chattering)

986
00:53:43.958 --> 00:53:45.425
- [Roxy] Tell me to chill again.

987
00:53:49.362 --> 00:53:50.631
(Rishi speaking in
foreign language)

988
00:53:50.665 --> 00:53:52.133
- [Pete] Shut the fuck up, man.

989
00:53:52.166 --> 00:53:53.266
God.

990
00:53:55.837 --> 00:53:58.305
- [Roxy] This is all
your fucking fault.

991
00:53:58.338 --> 00:53:59.941
- [Pete] My fault?

992
00:53:59.974 --> 00:54:01.274
Fucking Ellis's fault.

993
00:54:06.814 --> 00:54:07.949
- Get out of the way.

994
00:54:10.952 --> 00:54:11.786
- Boss, I'm gonna open this.

995
00:54:11.819 --> 00:54:12.854
- [Ellis] Go ahead.

996
00:54:17.558 --> 00:54:19.459
- Oh you fucking idiot!

997
00:54:19.493 --> 00:54:22.496
- All right, we got
a situation here.

998
00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:24.198
Obviously the firm's trying
to send us a message.

999
00:54:24.232 --> 00:54:25.465
If we don't find
that money soon,

1000
00:54:25.499 --> 00:54:28.368
we're all gonna end up
in a landfill somewhere.

1001
00:54:28.401 --> 00:54:29.469
- I'll talk to them.

1002
00:54:34.041 --> 00:54:35.342
- You'll talk to who?

1003
00:54:36.177 --> 00:54:37.879
- I'll talk to the firm.

1004
00:54:37.912 --> 00:54:38.880
Straighten things out.

1005
00:54:41.115 --> 00:54:41.916
- Huh?

1006
00:54:41.949 --> 00:54:42.850
Gimme that box.

1007
00:54:44.451 --> 00:54:45.953
That's a good idea.

1008
00:54:47.021 --> 00:54:48.790
- Right, fuck, I told you guys.

1009
00:54:48.823 --> 00:54:50.258
Jesus Christ.

1010
00:54:50.323 --> 00:54:51.826
Fucking finally, you
gotta trust me more.

1011
00:54:51.859 --> 00:54:52.760
- Yeah.

1012
00:54:54.228 --> 00:54:55.696
Would you get it
over with, please?

1013
00:54:55.730 --> 00:54:59.066
(suspenseful music)
(knife thuds)

1014
00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:01.769
(Pete groaning)

1015
00:55:04.872 --> 00:55:08.042
(body thuds)

1016
00:55:08.075 --> 00:55:10.077
- Big mouth, motherfucker.

1017
00:55:10.111 --> 00:55:11.411
Told you to keep
your mouth shut.

1018
00:55:11.444 --> 00:55:12.980
- Shut the fuck
up you small cock.

1019
00:55:13.014 --> 00:55:14.182
Move.

1020
00:55:14.215 --> 00:55:16.050
- God, it's a new car,
you'd take it too.

1021
00:55:19.153 --> 00:55:20.054
Damn, he's fat.

1022
00:55:31.833 --> 00:55:32.800
(birds chirping)

1023
00:55:32.834 --> 00:55:35.136
- Thank you for meeting
with us Mr. Ostein.

1024
00:55:35.169 --> 00:55:36.504
Just a few questions.

1025
00:55:38.306 --> 00:55:40.340
- I don't understand
why I'm here.

1026
00:55:40.373 --> 00:55:41.075
What's going on?

1027
00:55:42.743 --> 00:55:44.444
- If understand this
right, your son, Michael,

1028
00:55:44.477 --> 00:55:47.215
was on a wait list for a kidney,

1029
00:55:47.248 --> 00:55:48.950
but then he suddenly
dropped from the list.

1030
00:55:49.851 --> 00:55:51.586
- Did your son die, sir?

1031
00:55:52.787 --> 00:55:54.387
- No.

1032
00:55:54.421 --> 00:55:56.356
No, no, no, he's fine.

1033
00:55:58.626 --> 00:56:00.862
- I, I don't understand.

1034
00:56:00.895 --> 00:56:02.964
- He got a transplant.

1035
00:56:02.997 --> 00:56:04.632
Is that why I'm here?

1036
00:56:04.665 --> 00:56:07.467
- Your son was on a
very long waiting list.

1037
00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:08.736
You want to tell us where you

1038
00:56:08.769 --> 00:56:10.571
end up getting the kidney from?

1039
00:56:10.605 --> 00:56:12.773
- We rushed him into China.

1040
00:56:12.807 --> 00:56:13.875
Huashan Hospital.

1041
00:56:15.408 --> 00:56:18.913
Wasn't easy nor cheap,
but I had the means

1042
00:56:18.946 --> 00:56:20.848
and he is my son.

1043
00:56:20.882 --> 00:56:23.818
Huashan Hospital is a fantastic
teaching hospital by way.

1044
00:56:25.418 --> 00:56:26.120
- Is this you?

1045
00:56:29.991 --> 00:56:32.793
(brooding music)

1046
00:56:35.830 --> 00:56:38.398
(ominous music)

1047
00:56:40.334 --> 00:56:42.270
First I thought
that was your lunch,

1048
00:56:42.303 --> 00:56:44.038
but then I read the big labels.

1049
00:56:44.071 --> 00:56:45.472
Can you read it?

1050
00:56:45.506 --> 00:56:48.042
Yeah, you landed
in China with it.

1051
00:56:48.075 --> 00:56:50.745
And I'm sure that wasn't
on the SkyMall catalog.

1052
00:56:52.445 --> 00:56:54.481
And I was thinking
if someone sold you

1053
00:56:56.183 --> 00:56:57.752
a good kidney in
the black market,

1054
00:56:59.153 --> 00:57:01.956
and since a good kidney could
only last for 24 to 36 hours,

1055
00:57:03.557 --> 00:57:06.459
you had plenty of time to
hop on your corporate jet

1056
00:57:06.493 --> 00:57:08.796
and deliver just in time
to save your kid's life.

1057
00:57:11.599 --> 00:57:13.834
- Mr. Ofstein, I
have children too.

1058
00:57:16.003 --> 00:57:19.740
I understand you did what you
did to save your child's life.

1059
00:57:19.774 --> 00:57:21.342
But unfortunately, another child

1060
00:57:21.375 --> 00:57:22.977
had to die to make that happen.

1061
00:57:27.515 --> 00:57:30.518
(brooding music)

1062
00:57:43.097 --> 00:57:43.998
- Fuck.

1063
00:57:45.465 --> 00:57:48.002
I, i had to do it, okay?

1064
00:57:48.035 --> 00:57:49.003
That's my son.

1065
00:57:51.672 --> 00:57:53.107
- Who contacted you?

1066
00:57:55.643 --> 00:57:57.778
- Some dirt bagging named Ellis,

1067
00:57:59.313 --> 00:58:01.015
tried to fucking extort
me for more money

1068
00:58:01.048 --> 00:58:02.249
after I already paid him.

1069
00:58:04.352 --> 00:58:06.053
Said the FBI took my money.

1070
00:58:08.723 --> 00:58:11.692
- Would you like an attorney
before you say anything else?

1071
00:58:20.968 --> 00:58:22.670
- No, I'm fine.

1072
00:58:25.306 --> 00:58:27.074
- Where can we find this Ellis?

1073
00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:37.852

want a macchiato.

- She wants an update.

1117
01:01:35.462 --> 01:01:37.131

time she wants to meet

1121
01:01:58.219 --> 01:02:00.689
just give me a phone call,
we can make an appointment.

We meet somewhere neutral,
like two civilized people.

1123
01:02:04.892 --> 01:02:06.760
- [Kevin] How about the money?

1124
01:02:06.794 --> 01:02:07.962
- I'm working on that.

1125
01:02:09.964 --> 01:02:11.098
But you're not making it easy

1126
01:02:11.131 --> 01:02:13.067

The firm got to him.

1141
01:03:24.838 --> 01:03:26.440
- No, it's not the firm.

1142
01:03:27.975 --> 01:03:29.877
I believe we have
another player.

1143
01:03:30.811 --> 01:03:32.212

(door bangs)

1151
01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.389
- [Max] Where is my daughter?

1152
01:05:24.324 --> 01:05:25.926
- Do we have business together?

1153
01:05:34.935 --> 01:05:38.939
Holy hoochie coochie
man. (laughs)

1154
01:05:38.972 --> 01:05:40.708
Well, this all makes sense now.

1155
01:05:43.010 --> 01:05:43.711
- Where's Ari?

1156
01:05:45.446 --> 01:05:48.482
- I'm glad you're here because
a few things I wanna explain.

1157
01:05:49.851 --> 01:05:51.051
First of all, I
understand your anger

1158
01:05:51.084 --> 01:05:53.353
about what happened
to your, your wife,

1159
01:05:53.387 --> 01:05:55.022
and your brother, and your kid.

1160
01:05:55.956 --> 01:05:57.124
But I gotta tell you,

1161
01:05:57.157 --> 01:06:00.127
that was all on your
lying two-faced brother.

1162
01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.830
You see, I trusted
him with some money

1163
01:06:01.863 --> 01:06:04.031
that did not belong to me.

1164
01:06:04.064 --> 01:06:05.800
Then after a long conversation

1165
01:06:05.834 --> 01:06:08.736
and a detailed manicure
by my assistant,

1166
01:06:08.770 --> 01:06:10.270
he became a little
more reasonable.

1167
01:06:10.304 --> 01:06:12.973
So I decided not to kill him
if he gave me my money back.

1168
01:06:14.341 --> 01:06:18.979
But then he lied to me again
and he went to your house.

1169
01:06:20.113 --> 01:06:22.316
So you see, we thought
that was his family.

1170
01:06:23.918 --> 01:06:26.053
So all of this is

1171
01:06:26.086 --> 01:06:30.491
because of your lying two-faced
piece of shit brother.

1172
01:06:31.659 --> 01:06:32.627
- Where's my daughter?

1173
01:06:33.628 --> 01:06:35.797
(suspenseful music)

1174
01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:37.699
- Oh, she's right behind you.

1175
01:06:37.732 --> 01:06:38.933
(club thuds)

1176
01:06:38.967 --> 01:06:40.300
(body thuds)

1177
01:06:40.334 --> 01:06:41.603
- [Junior] How was that boss?

1178
01:06:41.636 --> 01:06:43.303
- [Ellis] That was good, Junior.

1179
01:06:45.372 --> 01:06:48.041
(Max grunting)

1180
01:06:51.679 --> 01:06:54.314
(Max grunting)

1181
01:06:55.517 --> 01:06:56.216
- Fuckers.

1182
01:07:01.956 --> 01:07:03.625
I'm gonna kill you.

1183
01:07:04.458 --> 01:07:07.127
(metal clicks)

1184
01:07:11.431 --> 01:07:12.534

1185

(Max groaning)

1195
01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.550
- Junior, boss is
not gonna like this.

1196
01:08:03.885 --> 01:08:05.653
(Junior speaks in
foreign language)

1197
01:08:05.687 --> 01:08:08.121
- Sooner you tell Ellis
what he needs to know,

1198
01:08:08.155 --> 01:08:09.256
better off you'll be.

1199
01:08:11.726 --> 01:08:14.963
Or I'll have to carve you
like I did your bitch wife.

1200
01:08:14.996 --> 01:08:17.832

(Max groaning)

1204
01:08:39.087 --> 01:08:41.121

1205
01:08:44.826 --> 01:08:46.094
- No.

1206
01:08:46.126 --> 01:08:48.763
(Max groaning)

1207
01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:54.769

1208
01:08:56.236 --> 01:08:58.573
What are you doing?

1209
01:08:58.606 --> 01:08:59.974
Goddamn you.

1210
01:09:00.008 --> 01:09:02.142
What did I tell you
about this kind of shit?

1211
01:09:07.915 --> 01:09:08.816
Ugh.

1212
01:09:10.183 --> 01:09:12.820
I apologize for
these barbarians.

1213
01:09:12.854 --> 01:09:14.388
This is not my style.

1214
01:09:19.393 --> 01:09:20.828

Hey, hold on, hold on.

1218

(Max groaning)

1219
01:09:34.642 --> 01:09:35.743
I'm so sorry.

1220
01:09:35.777 --> 01:09:37.011
You must think I'm a monster.

I'm not a monster.

1224
01:09:57.699 --> 01:09:58.700
- Where is she?

1225
01:09:59.499 --> 01:10:00.902
- Your daughter's fine.

1226
01:10:02.436 --> 01:10:03.938
I have a little
proposal for you,

1227
01:10:05.439 --> 01:10:06.774
but first you have
to give me your word

1228
01:10:06.808 --> 01:10:10.477
that you're gonna drop
this whole situation

1229
01:10:13.147 --> 01:10:14.314
about your wife

1230
01:10:14.347 --> 01:10:15.917
and that piece of
shit brother of yours.

1231
01:10:17.250 --> 01:10:19.020
What's done is done and
I can't change the past.

1232
01:10:19.053 --> 01:10:21.923
I wish I could but I can't.

1233
01:10:24.491 --> 01:10:26.226
You see, I know how you feel.

1234
01:10:27.427 --> 01:10:32.232
I lost a son at 17, that leaves
a deep hole in your heart.

1235
01:10:33.167 --> 01:10:34.234
Great pain.

1236
01:10:35.737 --> 01:10:36.771
But unlike me,

1237
01:10:36.804 --> 01:10:39.372
you have the opportunity
to become a daddy again.

1238
01:10:39.406 --> 01:10:41.274
So you tell me where my money is

1239
01:10:42.242 --> 01:10:43.945
and I'll return your
daughter to you.

1240
01:10:47.715 --> 01:10:51.686
Junior, make sure
your phone is charged.

1241
01:10:52.854 --> 01:10:54.354
- Okay, I'm gonna go.

1242
01:10:57.792 --> 01:11:02.730
- Now when all this is done,
our business is concluded.

1243
01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:06.934
I need your word on that.

1244
01:11:08.002 --> 01:11:10.805
(Max exhales)

1245
01:11:10.838 --> 01:11:12.206
Go get Roxy.

1246
01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:13.040
We're gonna go
for a little ride.

1247
01:11:13.074 --> 01:11:13.975
- Yes, boss.

1248
01:11:16.309 --> 01:11:20.313
- You have to trust me because
we're both victims here.

1249
01:11:23.518 --> 01:11:24.952
Do I have your word?

1250
01:11:30.024 --> 01:11:32.827
(dramatic music)

1251
01:11:38.699 --> 01:11:39.934
When we get back,

1252
01:11:39.967 --> 01:11:41.836
I'm gonna need you to take
Junior to the Butcher.

1253
01:11:43.336 --> 01:11:46.808
He conned me and now
has to pay the price.

1254
01:11:50.443 --> 01:11:54.949
Yeah, I'm gonna put a
whole new crew together.

1255
01:11:58.686 --> 01:12:01.354
(birds chirping)

1256
01:12:05.425 --> 01:12:08.461
(cigarette hissing)

1257
01:12:10.765 --> 01:12:12.700
(gun clicks)

1258
01:12:12.733 --> 01:12:14.702
- Anyone seen a human chop shop?

1259
01:12:18.506 --> 01:12:20.340
What are you a henchman?

1260
01:12:20.373 --> 01:12:21.075
Guess what?

1261
01:12:22.409 --> 01:12:24.111
I wipe my ass with
fucking henchman.

1262
01:12:25.478 --> 01:12:28.783
Looks like they left you
here to watch the shop,

1263
01:12:28.816 --> 01:12:30.718
which makes you
disposable, puto.

1264
01:12:35.089 --> 01:12:35.990
- Huh?

1265
01:12:38.391 --> 01:12:42.063
(suspenseful music)

1266
01:12:42.096 --> 01:12:44.832
(ominous music)

1267
01:12:51.873 --> 01:12:55.509
(Santiago speaking
in foreign language)

1268
01:12:55.543 --> 01:12:57.612
- Keep fucking walking.

1269
01:12:59.247 --> 01:13:00.480
What the fuck is this?

1270
01:13:01.448 --> 01:13:03.351
(Max groaning)

1271
01:13:03.383 --> 01:13:06.520
Max Kelly, you're alive.

1272
01:13:07.955 --> 01:13:08.856
- [Junior] Duh.

1273
01:13:08.890 --> 01:13:09.957
- Shut the fuck up.

1274
01:13:12.793 --> 01:13:14.427
Cut him loose.

1275
01:13:14.461 --> 01:13:15.696
Cut him loose!

1276
01:13:20.868 --> 01:13:22.069
(Max groaning)

1277
01:13:22.103 --> 01:13:24.071
What the fuck happened?

1278
01:13:27.341 --> 01:13:29.543
- Just trying to
stop the monsters.

1279
01:13:33.413 --> 01:13:34.916
(Santiago speaks in
foreign language)

1280
01:13:34.949 --> 01:13:36.584
Fucking back up.

1281
01:13:36.617 --> 01:13:40.420
(speaks in foreign language)

1282
01:13:41.389 --> 01:13:42.489
You're gonna see
your fucking dad

1283
01:13:42.523 --> 01:13:44.158
and your mom in fucking prison.

1284
01:13:45.159 --> 01:13:46.928
Enjoy your nights there, dog.

1285
01:13:48.461 --> 01:13:49.263
(suspenseful music)

1286
01:13:49.297 --> 01:13:52.166
(Santiago grunting)

1287
01:13:57.437 --> 01:14:00.141
- Go to sleep, go to sleep.

1288
01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:13.321
- No, no.

1289
01:14:13.354 --> 01:14:14.121
(Max grunts)
(birds chirping)

1290
01:14:14.155 --> 01:14:15.823
(door bangs)

1291
01:14:15.856 --> 01:14:18.458
(brooding music)

1292
01:14:22.863 --> 01:14:24.065
- Ah, true fire.

1293
01:14:24.098 --> 01:14:25.166
- Look at all this shit.

1294
01:14:26.534 --> 01:14:27.768
Look through these boxes.

1295
01:14:27.802 --> 01:14:29.737
I got the other half.
- Ha, ha, yeah, yeah.

1296
01:14:35.142 --> 01:14:40.214
- What the fuck is this?

1297
01:14:43.117 --> 01:14:44.484
Motherfucker.

1298
01:15:00.534 --> 01:15:02.436
Yo fucker, I gotta go
show this shit to Ellis.

1299
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:03.571
Keep looking.

1300
01:15:21.122 --> 01:15:23.491
(Rishi laughs)

1301
01:15:23.524 --> 01:15:25.059
- [Rishi] Hey, come here.

1302
01:15:26.694 --> 01:15:27.561
- What's that?

1303
01:15:29.730 --> 01:15:30.698
Are you fucking serious?

1304
01:15:30.731 --> 01:15:33.034
- Who's the boss now, bitch?

1305
01:15:33.067 --> 01:15:34.835
- Oh, pack this shit up.

1306
01:15:40.007 --> 01:15:40.708
Oh, fuck.

1307
01:15:43.044 --> 01:15:45.079
(Rishi grunting)

1308
01:15:45.112 --> 01:15:47.114
(ominous music)

1309
01:15:47.148 --> 01:15:50.217
(suspenseful music)

1310
01:15:52.353 --> 01:15:54.155
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1311
01:15:54.188 --> 01:15:57.058
(explosion booming)

1312
01:16:00.661 --> 01:16:04.031
(building crumbling)

1313
01:16:04.065 --> 01:16:06.867
(fire crackling)

1314
01:16:13.941 --> 01:16:14.742
- Oh, shit.

1315
01:16:20.181 --> 01:16:23.017
(birds chirping)

1316
01:16:28.823 --> 01:16:33.694
(Santiago groans)

1317
01:16:35.530 --> 01:16:38.632

1320
01:16:54.815 --> 01:16:56.250
(footsteps tapping)

1321
01:16:56.283 --> 01:16:57.552
Well, my friend looks like

1322
01:16:57.586 --> 01:16:59.487
we have a little bit
of a situation, huh?

1323
01:16:59.521 --> 01:17:00.988
Have to make a
slight adjustment.

1324
01:17:04.593 --> 01:17:05.594
Shit.

1325
01:17:05.626 --> 01:17:08.362
(phone buzzing)

1326
01:17:11.031 --> 01:17:11.732
This is Ellis.

1327
01:17:13.834 --> 01:17:16.637
Yeah, I'll be there.

1328
01:17:19.073 --> 01:17:21.842
Well, Junior, well, it looks
like you got a little bit

1329
01:17:21.876 --> 01:17:23.777
of your own medicine
now, didn't you?

1330
01:17:27.748 --> 01:17:30.818
(suspenseful music)

1331
01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:38.792
(birds chirping)

1332
01:17:38.826 --> 01:17:41.795
(group chattering)

1333
01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:50.871
Can we just get this over with?

1334
01:17:52.206 --> 01:17:53.707
(case clicks)

1335
01:17:53.741 --> 01:17:55.342
- Hell is that?

1336
01:17:55.376 --> 01:17:57.444
(gun banging)

1337
01:17:57.478 --> 01:17:58.712
(woman screams)
(gun bangs)

1338
01:17:58.746 --> 01:18:01.415
(ominous music)

1339
01:18:10.491 --> 01:18:12.259
(door clicks)

1340
01:18:12.293 --> 01:18:14.061
(suspenseful music)

1341
01:18:14.094 --> 01:18:15.696
(door bangs)

1342
01:18:15.729 --> 01:18:18.465
(phone buzzing)

1343
01:18:19.266 --> 01:18:20.234
- Captain Daniels.

1344
01:18:21.502 --> 01:18:23.170
- [Santiago] The
bastard is not home.

1345
01:18:24.104 --> 01:18:26.240
- And what about the black SUV?

1346
01:18:26.273 --> 01:18:27.841
- [Santiago] Nope.

1347
01:18:29.410 --> 01:18:30.778
- All right, well stay put.

1348
01:18:30.811 --> 01:18:32.813
Let me know if anything happens.

1349
01:18:32.846 --> 01:18:35.349
Do not go inside until
I get you a warrant.

1350
01:18:35.382 --> 01:18:36.984
Do you understand?

1351
01:18:37.017 --> 01:18:38.653
Just keep your eyes open, okay?

1352
01:18:38.687 --> 01:18:40.655
Just report from the curb

1353
01:18:40.689 --> 01:18:42.990
and just let me know if
anything odd happens.

1354
01:18:43.924 --> 01:18:44.959
- I'll try my best.

1355
01:18:48.295 --> 01:18:51.398
(slow tempo guitar music)

1356
01:18:51.432 --> 01:18:54.268
So you want me sit down
in the car all afternoon

1357
01:18:54.301 --> 01:18:56.237
and, and wait, right?

1358
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:57.805
- I'm downloading
his credit report

1359
01:18:57.838 --> 01:19:00.642
and his credit card
statements to you as we speak.

1360
01:19:00.675 --> 01:19:01.775
Check 'em out.

1361
01:19:01.809 --> 01:19:05.179
(Santiago choking)

1362
01:19:05.212 --> 01:19:06.615
Are you okay?

1363
01:19:06.648 --> 01:19:07.748
- Yep.

1364
01:19:08.415 --> 01:19:09.850
(Santiago coughs)

1365
01:19:09.883 --> 01:19:11.452
- Just let me know if
anything odd happens.

1366
01:19:22.530 --> 01:19:25.332
(birds chirping)

1367
01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:38.012
(car engine roaring)
(tires screeching)

1368
01:19:42.916 --> 01:19:45.486
(door clicks)

1369
01:19:57.831 --> 01:20:00.568
(ominous music)

1370
01:20:02.803 --> 01:20:06.206
(ashes rustling)

1371
01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:08.442
(urn thuds)

1372
01:20:10.745 --> 01:20:13.548
(car engine roaring)
(suspenseful music)

1373
01:20:13.581 --> 01:20:16.483
(car door clicks)

1374
01:20:26.695 --> 01:20:27.828
- Fuck, fuck.

1375
01:20:40.608 --> 01:20:43.877
(car engine roaring)

1376
01:20:52.721 --> 01:20:55.356
(ominous music)

1377
01:22:01.488 --> 01:22:03.390
- Where's my daughter?

1378
01:22:05.926 --> 01:22:07.027
- Don't do it, Max!

1379
01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:08.095
Don't do it!

1380
01:22:09.329 --> 01:22:11.533
- What the fuck
are you doing here?

1381
01:22:11.566 --> 01:22:13.300
- Shut the fuck up, fuck face!

1382
01:22:13.333 --> 01:22:13.967
- Bullshit!

1383
01:22:14.001 --> 01:22:15.537
(gun bangs)

1384
01:22:15.570 --> 01:22:16.270
- This is between him and I.

1385
01:22:18.205 --> 01:22:19.808
He's not leaving with you.

1386
01:22:19.841 --> 01:22:21.175
- Put the gun down!

1387
01:22:23.210 --> 01:22:25.379
You don't, don't fucking move!

1388
01:22:27.314 --> 01:22:28.917
- [Max] He's not
leaving with you.

1389
01:22:28.949 --> 01:22:31.553
(ominous music)

1390
01:22:31.586 --> 01:22:32.486
- Motherfucker.

1391
01:22:34.254 --> 01:22:38.058
I don't want to shoot you,
but I will fucking kill you.

1392
01:22:38.091 --> 01:22:39.326
Think about it, Max.

1393
01:22:39.359 --> 01:22:40.027
- No!

1394
01:22:41.361 --> 01:22:43.698
- Hey, you want justice, right?

1395
01:22:43.731 --> 01:22:44.632
What about the other kids?

1396
01:22:44.666 --> 01:22:46.200
What about the other parents?

1397
01:22:46.233 --> 01:22:47.434
They want justice too.

1398
01:22:48.302 --> 01:22:50.672
Don't take that away from them.

1399
01:22:50.705 --> 01:22:54.107
Max, this isn't about you.

1400
01:23:21.903 --> 01:23:23.003
- Thank you.

1401
01:23:27.074 --> 01:23:30.010
Don't even think about
that chocking shit again

1402
01:23:30.043 --> 01:23:32.012
or I'll shoot you
in the fucking face.

1403
01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:39.019
You turn around.

1404
01:23:40.622 --> 01:23:42.022
Hands behind your back.

1405
01:23:45.894 --> 01:23:47.060
- Where's my daughter?

1406
01:23:48.362 --> 01:23:50.832
- You got a lot of nerve
asking me about your daughter

1407
01:23:50.865 --> 01:23:52.767
after you desecrated
my dead son.

1408
01:23:55.670 --> 01:23:57.304
Let me think about this.

1409
01:23:58.472 --> 01:24:01.743
Was she a kidney donor
or a, or a heart donor?

1410
01:24:02.810 --> 01:24:05.045
I get all confused.

1411
01:24:05.078 --> 01:24:06.948
Yeah, this organ business,
I never liked it.

1412
01:24:06.981 --> 01:24:09.416
I'm, I'm a weapons
and drug person.

1413
01:24:10.752 --> 01:24:13.453
This is, you know, but
now that I think about it,

1414
01:24:14.488 --> 01:24:16.089
well, part of her
could be in California.

1415
01:24:16.123 --> 01:24:17.759
The other part could
be in the East Coast.

1416
01:24:17.792 --> 01:24:18.960
I don't know.

1417
01:24:18.993 --> 01:24:22.062
And you, you little shit,

1418
01:24:22.095 --> 01:24:24.164
you better fucking
watch every word you say

1419
01:24:24.197 --> 01:24:26.066
'cause we got eyes
on little Ray Ray.

1420
01:24:28.703 --> 01:24:30.470
(chuckles) Yeah.

1421
01:24:30.504 --> 01:24:32.040
It was your old partner's idea.

1422
01:24:32.072 --> 01:24:34.174
I gotta say I thought
it was pretty good.

1423
01:24:34.207 --> 01:24:36.511
'Cause little Ray Ray
will make a good donor.

1424
01:24:37.979 --> 01:24:39.079
- The fuck.

1425
01:24:44.786 --> 01:24:46.119
What a fucking prick.

1426
01:24:47.622 --> 01:24:48.957
What a fucking idiot.

1427
01:24:48.990 --> 01:24:50.390
- Oh, come on.

1428
01:24:50.424 --> 01:24:51.626
Don't be too hard on yourself.

1429
01:24:51.659 --> 01:24:53.595
You know I never lose.

1430
01:24:53.628 --> 01:24:55.362
- No, not you.

1431
01:24:55.395 --> 01:24:57.732
I'm not talking about
you, you fucking prick.

1432
01:25:00.133 --> 01:25:01.401
I'm talking about me.

1433
01:25:02.704 --> 01:25:04.539
I'm so fucking stupid.

1434
01:25:06.239 --> 01:25:07.942
(Santiago laughs)

1435
01:25:07.976 --> 01:25:10.812
(cuffs clicking)

1436
01:25:12.412 --> 01:25:15.449
This is a federal case.

1437
01:25:18.418 --> 01:25:19.854
I have no jurisdiction.

1438
01:25:23.758 --> 01:25:24.659
My bad.

1439
01:25:30.765 --> 01:25:32.165
You're on your own, bitch.

1440
01:25:34.102 --> 01:25:37.905
(slow tempo suspenseful music)

1441
01:25:46.781 --> 01:25:49.617
(fast tempo suspenseful music)
(knife clangs)

1442
01:25:49.651 --> 01:25:51.552
(knife whooshing)

1443
01:25:51.586 --> 01:25:54.689
(knife whooshing)

1444
01:25:54.722 --> 01:25:57.825
(knife whooshing)

1445
01:25:57.859 --> 01:25:58.660
(Ellis grunts)
(knife thuds)

1446
01:25:58.693 --> 01:25:59.927
(Ellis screams)

1447
01:25:59.961 --> 01:26:02.730
(Ellis groaning)

1448
01:26:04.532 --> 01:26:07.467
(Ellis groans)

1449
01:26:07.501 --> 01:26:12.573
(ominous music)
(Ellis groaning)

1450
01:26:22.315 --> 01:26:24.686
- Is that all you got?

1451
01:26:24.719 --> 01:26:27.320
(Ellis groaning)

1452
01:26:33.828 --> 01:26:34.796
Yeah, fuck.

1453
01:26:36.764 --> 01:26:38.966
(Ellis groaning)

1454
01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.269
(suspenseful music)

1455
01:26:46.107 --> 01:26:48.676
(bat tapping)

1456
01:26:57.018 --> 01:27:01.823
(Max grunting)
(bat thudding)

1457
01:27:06.194 --> 01:27:11.264
(bat thuds)
(Max grunts)

1458
01:27:11.799 --> 01:27:12.399
- For Ari.

1459
01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:14.102
(Max grunts)
(bat thuds)

1460
01:27:14.135 --> 01:27:16.871
(blood splattering)

1461
01:27:16.904 --> 01:27:19.807
(flesh squishing)

1462
01:27:22.777 --> 01:27:24.979
(Max spits)

1463
01:27:25.847 --> 01:27:28.583
(phone ringing)

1464
01:27:49.369 --> 01:27:52.305
(phone buzzing)

1465
01:27:58.646 --> 01:27:59.614
- Hello.

1466
01:27:59.647 --> 01:28:01.149
- [Hanna] Hey, Dave,
how's it going?

1467
01:28:01.182 --> 01:28:03.751
- Yeah, thanks for
calling me back.

1468
01:28:04.719 --> 01:28:05.753
So you heard my message, right?

1469
01:28:05.787 --> 01:28:06.654
- [Hanna] Yes.

1470
01:28:07.655 --> 01:28:08.556
- Yeah.

1471
01:28:10.290 --> 01:28:12.260
I swear I'll do anything.

1472
01:28:12.292 --> 01:28:13.460
If you want me to
quit, I'll quit.

1473
01:28:13.493 --> 01:28:16.264
(Hanna chattering)

1474
01:28:16.296 --> 01:28:17.064
And I love you.

1475
01:28:18.666 --> 01:28:21.401
I need you and those
little fucking pricks.

1476
01:28:21.434 --> 01:28:22.502
(Hanna chattering)

1477
01:28:22.537 --> 01:28:23.805
That didn't come out right.

1478
01:28:23.838 --> 01:28:24.972
I, I, I really?

1479
01:28:25.940 --> 01:28:28.643
(Hanna chattering)

1480
01:28:28.676 --> 01:28:29.677
Really.

1481
01:28:29.710 --> 01:28:31.679
- [Hanna] Yes, but
only if you promise.

1482
01:28:31.712 --> 01:28:33.147
- Yeah.

1483
01:28:33.181 --> 01:28:34.081
Yeah.

1484
01:28:35.216 --> 01:28:36.951
Great, great, great.

1485
01:28:37.952 --> 01:28:38.986
I will, I'll see you soon.

1486
01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:40.121
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1487
01:28:40.154 --> 01:28:41.289
(Hanna chattering)

1488
01:28:41.321 --> 01:28:42.023
Yeah.

1489
01:28:43.691 --> 01:28:44.992
Yeah, okay.

1490
01:28:45.026 --> 01:28:47.662
- [Daniels] Santiago.

1491
01:28:47.695 --> 01:28:48.696
- Yeah.

1492
01:28:48.729 --> 01:28:50.097
- [Daniels] Get
your ass in here.

1493
01:28:50.131 --> 01:28:52.967
- Oh, damn, I'll
call you back, okay?

1494
01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:53.901
Yeah.

1495
01:28:57.972 --> 01:28:58.873
Yep.

1496
01:28:59.874 --> 01:29:03.678
(News Anchor chattering)

1497
01:29:03.711 --> 01:29:05.378
- Send up a flag and
we will definitely

1498
01:29:05.412 --> 01:29:06.814
cut back to you immediately.

1499
01:29:06.848 --> 01:29:08.448
Welcome back.

1500
01:29:08.481 --> 01:29:10.785
We go live now to Mike Tilliam,
who's there at the scene.

1501
01:29:10.818 --> 01:29:12.920
Mike tell us, what's
the new information?

1502
01:29:15.289 --> 01:29:16.724
- Here I am with Juan,

1503
01:29:16.757 --> 01:29:19.994
who works at the club where
this horrible murder took place.

1504
01:29:20.027 --> 01:29:21.461
Juan, tell us what happened.

1505
01:29:22.797 --> 01:29:26.399
- I was taking the trash
out and I heard the screams,

1506
01:29:26.433 --> 01:29:28.669
you know, and I
came out the back

1507
01:29:28.703 --> 01:29:32.472
and I saw this big
guy with a hoodie

1508
01:29:32.506 --> 01:29:34.041
on top of this black guy.

1509
01:29:35.343 --> 01:29:38.445
When he looked at
me, I saw his face.

1510
01:29:38.478 --> 01:29:42.783
He was, how you say in English?

1511
01:29:44.218 --> 01:29:48.388
(speaking in Spanish)

1512
01:29:49.422 --> 01:29:52.894
(speaking in Spanish)

1513
01:29:52.927 --> 01:29:56.297
- Juan says, "That the
assailant was very palido,"

1514
01:29:56.330 --> 01:29:58.966
which is Spanish for
someone very pale.

1515
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.602
Police will give us an
update in about an hour.

1516
01:30:01.636 --> 01:30:04.005
Who is this palido man?

1517
01:30:04.038 --> 01:30:08.142
Where is he and why did he
commit this terrible crime

1518
01:30:08.175 --> 01:30:09.409
is anyone's guess.

1519
01:30:10.211 --> 01:30:11.979
Back to you at the studio.

1520
01:30:12.013 --> 01:30:13.413
- Breaking now,

1521
01:30:13.446 --> 01:30:14.949
the bodies recovered
at Artie's Coffee Shop

1522
01:30:14.982 --> 01:30:17.919
have now been identified
as Renata Turner

1523
01:30:17.952 --> 01:30:19.687
who had been missing
since Interpol

1524
01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:22.356
raided one of her London
homes three years ago.

1525
01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:25.927
And also professional
assassin Andre Jurgen,

1526
01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:29.664
who was a member of the
highly trained German GSG 9.

1527
01:30:29.697 --> 01:30:32.833
Police say the suspect
drove off in a cargo van.

1528
01:30:32.867 --> 01:30:35.136
The story is still
wide and breaking.

1529
01:30:35.169 --> 01:30:36.537
Stay with us for the latest.

1530
01:30:43.277 --> 01:30:44.812
- Who's fucking with me, Santi?

1531
01:30:46.314 --> 01:30:48.249
And who is this palido

1532
01:30:48.282 --> 01:30:50.051
they keep talking
about on the news?

1533
01:30:53.321 --> 01:30:54.522
- Yeah.

1534
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:58.793
The world is full
of strange things.

1535
01:31:00.962 --> 01:31:01.996
- What did you do?

1536
01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:07.500
What's with the stupid grin?

1537
01:31:09.737 --> 01:31:11.539
- I'm gonna see
Hanna and the boys.

1538
01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:15.509
I, I think I'm
gonna move back in.

1539
01:31:16.444 --> 01:31:17.712
- You're moving back in?

1540
01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:20.281
Okay, well, that's
good for you, man.

1541
01:31:20.314 --> 01:31:21.582
I, that's good.

1542
01:31:21.615 --> 01:31:22.817
I appreciate that.

1543
01:31:22.850 --> 01:31:23.617
That's good.

1544
01:31:23.651 --> 01:31:24.618
I'm happy for you.

1545
01:31:25.853 --> 01:31:27.121
- Yeah.

1546
01:31:27.154 --> 01:31:30.958
Hey, remember when we found
that Xylazine and the opioids

1547
01:31:30.992 --> 01:31:31.792
in the baby's crib?

1548
01:31:31.826 --> 01:31:33.728
- Sure.
- And you found that gun

1549
01:31:34.729 --> 01:31:35.830
in the serial box.

1550
01:31:38.566 --> 01:31:39.967
You saved my life that day.

1551
01:31:41.168 --> 01:31:43.037
I never thanked you for it.

1552
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:45.039
- Shut the fuck up
and get outta here.

1553
01:31:48.142 --> 01:31:48.943
Santi.

1554
01:31:49.877 --> 01:31:51.278
Tell the boys,
Uncle Jeff says hi.

1555
01:31:57.084 --> 01:32:00.254
- Come back and see me
sometime. (chuckles)

1556
01:32:09.330 --> 01:32:13.000
(group chattering)

1557
01:32:13.034 --> 01:32:14.035
- Ah!

1558
01:32:14.068 --> 01:32:15.236
- That's right, Ray Ray.

1559
01:32:16.504 --> 01:32:17.304
- It's your turn.

1560
01:32:17.338 --> 01:32:18.706
Someone's turn.

1561
01:32:18.739 --> 01:32:20.307
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

1562
01:32:23.344 --> 01:32:24.245
- Yeah.

1563
01:32:25.846 --> 01:32:26.747
Yeah!

1564
01:32:28.115 --> 01:32:29.316
Ah, yeah.

1565
01:32:32.319 --> 01:32:33.621
(bag thuds)

1566
01:32:33.654 --> 01:32:34.855
Come on, Sam Sam.

1567
01:32:36.557 --> 01:32:37.358
(bag thuds)

1568
01:32:37.391 --> 01:32:38.759
- Oh, so close.

1569
01:32:38.793 --> 01:32:40.628
- All right, go then.

1570
01:32:40.661 --> 01:32:43.197
(phone dings)

1571
01:32:43.230 --> 01:32:45.099
- [Hanna] Oh, seriously?

1572
01:32:47.068 --> 01:32:49.270
- No, no, somebody
needs an address.

1573
01:32:51.872 --> 01:32:53.274
- Oh!

1574
01:32:53.307 --> 01:32:54.975
You have to go, we can go one.

1575
01:32:56.177 --> 01:32:57.378
- No, no.

1576
01:32:57.411 --> 01:32:59.046
You're my priority from now on.

1577
01:32:59.080 --> 01:32:59.847
Yeah.

1578
01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:01.082
- Really?

1579
01:33:01.115 --> 01:33:02.950
Is everything okay?

1580
01:33:02.983 --> 01:33:03.684
- Yeah.

1581
01:33:04.485 --> 01:33:06.120
Everything's fantabulous.

1582
01:33:07.455 --> 01:33:08.523
- [Ray] Ugh!

1583
01:33:08.557 --> 01:33:10.291
- Oh, my God.

1584
01:33:10.324 --> 01:33:12.326
- Nasty.
- Get a room really?

1585
01:33:14.028 --> 01:33:16.063
(Hanna laughs)

1586
01:33:16.097 --> 01:33:17.331
- Ah, shut up.

1587
01:33:18.299 --> 01:33:21.435
(bags thudding)

1588
01:33:21.469 --> 01:33:23.104
Throw it, throw it.

1589
01:33:24.605 --> 01:33:26.107
(wings fluttering)

1590
01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:27.509
(brooding music)

1591
01:33:27.542 --> 01:33:30.344
(knuckles tapping)

1592
01:33:31.312 --> 01:33:33.881
(door clicks)

1593
01:33:35.049 --> 01:33:35.950
- What?

1594
01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:39.687
You called?

1595
01:33:42.123 --> 01:33:43.657
I got this.

1596
01:33:43.691 --> 01:33:45.626
I got some tar left.

1597
01:33:46.260 --> 01:33:48.229
I got some, I got some.

1598
01:33:49.864 --> 01:33:50.464
What?

1599
01:33:50.498 --> 01:33:51.398
Whoa, hey!

1600
01:33:52.666 --> 01:33:54.168
(door bangs)

1601
01:33:54.201 --> 01:33:56.103
(Wendy screaming)

1602
01:33:56.137 --> 01:33:57.539
(bat thudding)

1603
01:33:57.572 --> 01:34:01.142
(suspenseful music)

1604
01:34:01.175 --> 01:34:03.711
(ominous music)

1605
01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:08.282
(tense ominous music)

1606
01:34:08.315 --> 01:34:11.118
(wings fluttering)

1607
01:34:15.456 --> 01:34:20.327
(clutch clicks)
(car engine roaring)

1608
01:34:21.495 --> 01:34:24.231
