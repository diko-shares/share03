It seems you have some talent
behind the wheel.

157

Out of curiosity,
when was the last time you raced?

158
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:14.397

162
00:21:26.827 --> 00:21:31.706
You're familiar with the Death Race
and the driver the fans call Frankenstein?

163

that he's forced to wear a mask.

164

165
00:21:41.216 --> 00:21:43.342
and therein lies my problem.

166
00:21:43.927 --> 00:21:46.262
No one knows yet, but poor Frank died

167
00:21:46.346 --> 00:21:49.640

not long after his last race.

168

to keep the legend alive.

174
00:22:12.414 --> 00:22:14.957
Why don't you just tell the truth?

175
00:22:15.959 --> 00:22:18.627
The audience wants to see Frank again.

176
00:22:19.546 --> 00:22:22.715
He moves them. Inspires them.

177
00:22:23.425 --> 00:22:26.802
And in this world,
that's not so easy to come by.

178
00:22:30.349 --> 00:22:32.892
What makes you think for a second

179
00:22:33.352 --> 00:22:36.187
I would risk my life doing this for you?

180
00:22:37.689 --> 00:22:39.398
Win five races,

181
00:22:40.108 --> 00:22:41.650
you go free.

182
00:22:42.944 --> 00:22:44.779
Those are the rules.

183
00:22:45.447 --> 00:22:47.448
And Frank has won four.

184
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:50.242
Win one more,

185
00:22:51.578 --> 00:22:53.037
you walk.

186
00:22:54.289 --> 00:22:56.290
Call it intuition, but...

187
00:22:59.711 --> 00:23:04.048
I don't think you belong in here
with the rest of these animals.

188
00:23:06.635 --> 00:23:08.636
I might surprise you.

189
00:23:21.274 --> 00:23:24.443
The race is Friday, and I need your decision.

190
00:23:25.946 --> 00:23:28.614
Ten seconds from now,
l will retract this offer,

191
00:23:28.698 --> 00:23:34.120
and extend it to Prisoner 68815,
James Francis Barlini,

192
00:23:34.204 --> 00:23:38.040
who, clearly not of your caliber,
will be quite enthusiastic about it.

193
00:23:38.792 --> 00:23:43.879
And you, unfortunately, will need to
spend your incarceration in solitary.

194
00:23:44.589 --> 00:23:47.883
Since now I know your dirty little secret.

195
00:23:48.135 --> 00:23:50.302
I'm sure you'll find solitary preferable

196
00:23:50.387 --> 00:23:54.473
to what Mr. Pachenko and his friends
have in mind for you.

197
00:23:55.725 --> 00:23:58.936
You're a skilled driver.
Your chances are good.

198
00:24:00.605 --> 00:24:03.441
I'm offering you your freedom, Mr. Ames.

199
00:24:05.152 --> 00:24:08.863
If it's not worth risking your life for,
what is?

200
00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:27.256
All right, turn her up and tighten the lines!
She's hemorrhaging!

201
00:24:30.177 --> 00:24:31.385
Ma'am.

202
00:24:31.511 --> 00:24:34.680
You don't have to call me "ma'am."
You know that.

203
00:24:36.016 --> 00:24:39.059
This is Mr. Ames. You know why he's here.

204
00:24:39.561 --> 00:24:41.061
Oh, I do now.

205
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:44.356
The race is less than a week away.

206
00:24:44.441 --> 00:24:46.734
I have great confidence in you.

207
00:24:48.195 --> 00:24:51.405
Well, then,
I'll leave you two to get acquainted.

208
00:24:55.076 --> 00:24:58.704
Jensen Garner Ames.
Moved to the States at 24 years old.

209
00:24:58.788 --> 00:25:03.584
Named after a car, the Jensen Interceptor.
A threetime local speedway champion.

210
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:07.004
You've done your homework.
Or do you just know everything?

211
00:25:07.088 --> 00:25:10.090
Jensen Interceptor. I had one.

212
00:25:10.592 --> 00:25:12.801
Handled like a school bus.

213
00:25:13.762 --> 00:25:16.764
Call me Coach. Everyone does.

214
00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:19.266
Gunner. Lists.

215
00:25:21.102 --> 00:25:22.603
This is Frank.

216
00:25:23.772 --> 00:25:25.689
I'll show you around.

217
00:25:26.441 --> 00:25:28.359
<font color="#FF0000">LISTS:</font> We have a fully functioning
auto shop,

218
00:25:28.443 --> 00:25:30.653
just like you'd find in the outside world.

219
00:25:30.779 --> 00:25:35.741
Each team has their own shop.
We don't help them. They don't help us.

220
00:25:35.825 --> 00:25:38.744
To the inmates, you're Jensen Ames,
the new grease monkey.

221
00:25:38.828 --> 00:25:41.163
<font color="#FF0000">LISTS:</font> Nobody will know you're Frank
except us on the team

222
00:25:41.289 --> 00:25:42.289
and a handful of the guards.

223
00:25:42.374 --> 00:25:43.457
Nobody will talk.

224
00:25:43.542 --> 00:25:44.959
How can you be so sure?

225
00:25:45.043 --> 00:25:50.297
Hennessey. In here, she is judge,
jury and executioner.

226
00:25:50.715 --> 00:25:54.593
The race is her baby.
Anyone who threatens it, she kills.

227
00:25:54.678 --> 00:25:57.638
The audience for the race has halved
since Frank's been out of the game,

228
00:25:57.722 --> 00:25:59.723
and so has the corporation's profit.

229
00:25:59.808 --> 00:26:01.850
That's why she needs you.

230
00:26:03.353 --> 00:26:05.145
What's back there?

231
00:26:06.147 --> 00:26:08.107
That's a good question.

232
00:26:08.191 --> 00:26:12.194
Hennessey's had a whole wing
of the prison in isolation for a month.

233
00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.154
Working on something.

234
00:26:14.698 --> 00:26:16.824
Time to meet the Monster.

235
00:26:21.871 --> 00:26:24.123
Mustang V8 Fastback.

236
00:26:24.207 --> 00:26:27.167
Took the best and made it better.

237
00:26:28.044 --> 00:26:32.089
That's a V8 Roush 5.4 liter
with a Ford Racing supercharger

238
00:26:32.173 --> 00:26:34.633
putting out 850 horsepower and close to...

239
00:26:34.718 --> 00:26:39.471
Seven hundred pounds of torque
with sequential multiport fuel injection.

240
00:26:39.556 --> 00:26:42.266
Looks like there's a 250 hp NOS unit.

241
00:26:43.518 --> 00:26:45.019
Just in case.

242
00:26:47.689 --> 00:26:51.650
Then we had some fun customizing
your personal protection package.

243
00:26:51.735 --> 00:26:55.696
Threequarter inch steel plate,
front and sides.

244
00:26:56.364 --> 00:27:00.409
Bulletproof glass will be here,
here and there.

245
00:27:00.535 --> 00:27:06.040
And in the rear, a sixinch
solid steel shield we call

246
00:27:08.209 --> 00:27:09.877
"the tombstone."

247
00:27:11.046 --> 00:27:15.883
Oil, smoke, and napalm for defense.

248
00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:20.846
And twin 30millimeter
beItfed machine guns for offense.

249
00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:22.556
So where's the ammo?

250
00:27:22.807 --> 00:27:25.684
We get that on race day.
Pity.

251
00:27:25.769 --> 00:27:28.896
Yeah. Everyone thinks that, first time.

252
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.147
Thinks what?

253
00:27:30.231 --> 00:27:33.609
About turning the guns on the guards,
about escaping.

254
00:27:33.735 --> 00:27:35.944
No, I wasn't thinking that.

255
00:27:36.071 --> 00:27:37.655
Well, I'm glad, because

256
00:27:37.739 --> 00:27:41.283
Hennessey has got electric kill switches
in all the guns in all the cars.

257
00:27:41.409 --> 00:27:45.996
And all the guard towers are fortified,
and their guns are bigger than your guns.

258
00:27:46.081 --> 00:27:47.831
But did I mention the helicopters,

259
00:27:47.916 --> 00:27:49.792
and aIso the fact
that we're on an island here

260
00:27:49.918 --> 00:27:51.627
a mile from the nearest shoreline?

261
00:27:51.753 --> 00:27:56.090
The only way in or out of here
is on that one skinny bridge you came in on.

262
00:28:09.938 --> 00:28:11.355
What's that?

263
00:28:11.815 --> 00:28:14.149
Most important part of the car.

264
00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:28.497
How many people has Frank killed?

265
00:28:28.832 --> 00:28:35.629
Twenty. The mortality rate
is average 62.2% per race.

266
00:28:36.464 --> 00:28:38.465
So Frank beat the odds four times.

267
00:28:39.634 --> 00:28:42.970
Yeah. Till they beat him.

268
00:28:58.319 --> 00:29:01.655
<font color="#FF0000">COACH:</font> The race takes place in three stages
over three days.

269
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:02.781
The first two stages,

270
00:29:02.866 --> 00:29:05.576
you just got to try and get rid of
as much of the competition as you can

271
00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:08.245
while getting your own skinny ass
over the line alive.

272
00:29:08.329 --> 00:29:12.708
Third stage is where speed counts.
First one over that line wins.

273
00:29:13.877 --> 00:29:17.337
Tomorrow morning,
you meet your navigator, Case.

274
00:29:18.506 --> 00:29:21.133
She'll help you navigate the course,
reload your weapons

275
00:29:21.217 --> 00:29:23.135
and help with the running of the car.

276
00:29:23.219 --> 00:29:25.679
I'd like to talk to her ahead of time,
before the race.

277
00:29:25.764 --> 00:29:28.223
Yeah. I'd like a bigtittie girl
to lick peanut butter off my toes.

278
00:29:28.349 --> 00:29:29.767
That ain't gonna happen.

279
00:29:29.851 --> 00:29:32.144
It's still a prison, man. She's a chick.

280
00:29:32.228 --> 00:29:35.147
They get bussed in
from the women's facility upstate.

281
00:29:35.231 --> 00:29:38.108
It's all about ratings,
fast cars, pretty women.

282
00:29:38.193 --> 00:29:41.153
Yeah, Machine Gun Joe is the only one
that has a male navigators.

283
00:29:41.237 --> 00:29:42.446
'Cause he's gay.

284
00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:47.159
Actually, it's 'cause he goes through them
so fast, the audience gets squeamish.

285
00:29:47.243 --> 00:29:50.370
Yeah, he goes through them.
Through their ass.

286
00:29:50.747 --> 00:29:55.709
He cuts each kill into his skin
as a souvenir, right here.

287

00:54:38.650 --> 00:54:40.901
Please excuse us, Mr. Ulrich.

516
00:54:43.905 --> 00:54:46.240
And take Mr. James with you.

517
00:54:58.628 --> 00:55:01.046
Do you recognize these people?

518
00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:04.091
Because your daughter will.

519
00:55:04.175 --> 00:55:06.176
They're her new parents.

520
00:55:06.845 --> 00:55:08.595
What's her name?

521
00:55:09.222 --> 00:55:10.431
Piper.

522
00:55:11.766 --> 00:55:14.768
That's the man she'll grow up calling Daddy.

523
00:55:16.563 --> 00:55:19.023
Unless you do something about it.

524
00:55:21.026 --> 00:55:22.818
Where is she now?

525
00:55:22.902 --> 00:55:26.363
Oh, I'm sure I have her address
around here somewhere.

526
00:55:26.906 --> 00:55:29.199
You're a smart man, Mr. Ames.

527
00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:33.245
Play my game, we both go home happy.

528
00:55:34.539 --> 00:55:37.708
The man who killed my wife
is in this prison.

529
00:55:39.085 --> 00:55:42.629
I wonder what he'll say
when I ask him why he did it.

530
00:55:42.714 --> 00:55:46.508
Why don't you look in a mirror? Ask him.

531
00:55:48.136 --> 00:55:52.222
Poor Piper. It must be hard
growing up with that knowledge.

532
00:55:53.141 --> 00:55:55.809
That your father killed your mother.

533
00:56:16.456 --> 00:56:18.290
You wanted a monster.

534
00:56:19.542 --> 00:56:21.377

Because I'm not a prisoner.

539
00:56:54.577 --> 00:56:58.914
I qualified for parole three years ago.

540

Got as far as the gate.

541
00:57:02.419 --> 00:57:06.004
They got a name for it,
somethingorother syndrome.

542
00:57:08.216 --> 00:57:12.469

since I've been in here.

What did they send you away for?
Oh, plenty.

546
00:57:22.272 --> 00:57:23.730
And nothing.

547
00:57:24.399 --> 00:57:27.526
To what do we owe
the pleasure of your company?

548
00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:31.405
I killed my wife.
Bullshit.

549
00:57:33.658 --> 00:57:36.702
You're a hard man,
but you ain't no wife killer.

550
00:57:36.786 --> 00:57:39.496
How do you know?
I've met my share.

551
00:57:40.832 --> 00:57:43.459
But you, the way you looked at her...

552
00:57:44.043 --> 00:57:47.546
You couldn't do that
if you'd killed her mother. So...

553
00:57:50.675 --> 00:57:52.426
I say bullshit.

554
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:56.638

555
00:58:00.602 --> 00:58:04.104
What would you say if I told you
Hennessey had my wife killed

556
00:58:04.189 --> 00:58:08.692
and me framed for it so she could
bring me in here to be her Frankenstein?

557
00:58:08.776 --> 00:58:11.361
What would you say to that bullshit?

558
00:58:16.951 --> 00:58:18.619
Her name was Suzy.

559
00:58:21.789 --> 00:58:24.708
I was always headed here. Always knew.

560
00:58:27.295 --> 00:58:28.754
She didn't.

561
00:58:32.634 --> 00:58:35.219
She was my chance at something eIse.

562
00:58:41.059 --> 00:58:43.769
And that bitch took her away from me.

It's my life back.

633

I'd have killed him, too.
I didn't kill him!

634
01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:22.704
He wouldn't quit.
I just wanted to make sure he didn't win.

635
01:07:22.788 --> 01:07:27.125
Why would Hennessey want that?
To keep Frank here, racing.

636
01:07:29.628 --> 01:07:31.046
And yesterday?

637
01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:32.547

So I'm not supposed to win, either.

are you really the best future
she could possibly have?

807
01:27:09.807 --> 01:27:14.144
Are you really daddy material?
Or deep down, are you something eIse?

on that track is where you belong,

867
01:34:27.078 --> 01:34:28.620
Give me that!

868
01:34:29.038 --> 01:34:34.709
Okay, cocksucker, fuck with me,
and we'll see who shits on the sidewalk.

869
01:34:38.923 --> 01:34:40.799
Somebody's mad right now.

870
01:34:40.925 --> 01:34:43.134
Nobody fucks with my car.

871
01:34:45.304 --> 01:34:46.680
Son of a bitch!

872
01:34:46.764 --> 01:34:48.056
Get the choppers in the air!

873
01:34:48.599 --> 01:34:51.267
Come on. Off the ground. Go, go, go!

875
01:35:09.787 --> 01:35:11.329
So what's your real name?

876
01:35:11.455 --> 01:35:13.498
I don't have the time for small talk.

877
01:35:13.624 --> 01:35:16.084
Just want to know who I'm riding with.

878
01:35:19.463 --> 01:35:22.006
Jensen Ames.

879
01:35:23.634 --> 01:35:25.468
Like...
Like the car.

880
01:35:25.594 --> 01:35:26.678
Like the car.

881
01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:31.349
Well, Jensen Ames, I hope you got a plan,

882
01:35:31.517 --> 01:35:33.601
'cause it's not like
we're going to get very far.

883
01:35:33.686 --> 01:35:34.936
You're right.

884
01:35:36.272 --> 01:35:37.313
We won't.

885
01:35:45.781 --> 01:35:47.866
Now would be a good time.

886
01:36:08.345 --> 01:36:10.221
Very nice modification.

Bon voyage, Frank.

01:36:52.681 --> 01:36:54.599
Choppers have a visual, ma'am.

890
01:37:07.112 --> 01:37:08.780
Good luck, Joe.

891
01:37:25.422 --> 01:37:28.758
Get me a pilot.
I need to talk to a pilot right now.

892
01:37:29.218 --> 01:37:30.343
Okay. You're on.

893
01:37:30.427 --> 01:37:31.928
Stay with Frankenstein! Don't lose him.

894
01:37:40.729 --> 01:37:43.314
Sure you're up for this?
I'm sure.

895
01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:44.691
I owe it to Frank.

896
01:37:44.775 --> 01:37:47.485
Besides, Hennessey already gave me
my release papers.

897
01:37:47.611 --> 01:37:49.779
They have to let me out.

898
01:39:00.476 --> 01:39:02.685
They've stopped him, ma'am.

Come on. Let's get out of here.

905
01:40:30.733 --> 01:40:31.899
Nice.

906
01:40:33.318 --> 01:40:36.404
The fact you have duds like these
might make someone question your...

907
01:40:36.488 --> 01:40:38.906
My taste?
Yeah. So to speak.

908
01:40:38.991 --> 01:40:41.075
I don't know about you,
but I'm headed to Miami.

909
01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:42.827
Miami's good.

910
01:40:43.662 --> 01:40:45.663
I'll meet you down there.

911
01:40:46.957 --> 01:40:49.000
Once I got my baby girl.

912
01:40:56.008 --> 01:40:58.676
It's a shame I didn't get to
take care of that bitch Hennessey.

913
01:40:58.802 --> 01:41:01.429
Yeah. That is a shame.

914
01:41:13.358 --> 01:41:14.984
Frankenstein has been retrieved.

915
01:41:15.069 --> 01:41:18.154
And, ma'am, ratings are off the charts.

916
01:41:19.198 --> 01:41:22.366

Damn.

921
01:41:43.347 --> 01:41:45.014

Yep. You better get used to it.

01:42:44.658 --> 01:42:45.992
Think we got a little company.

What took you so long?

932
01:43:30.287 --> 01:43:32.455
Had trouble getting
my release papers approved.

933
01:43:32.539 --> 01:43:35.541
Wait here.
There's someone I want you to meet.

934
01:43:39.630 --> 01:43:41.380
Look at her.

935
01:43:42.382 --> 01:43:44.050
She has beautiful eyes.

936
01:43:44.176 --> 01:43:45.593
They're her mother's.

Five hundred.

942
01:43:56.688 --> 01:43:58.064

01:44:03.904 --> 01:44:06.405
Something I've thought about
for a long time.

This is what I decided.

947

No one in this world is perfect.
Heaven knows I'm not.

948
01:44:15.165 --> 01:44:18.584
But I love her more than
anyone else possibly could.

949

In the end, that's all that matters.

950

Something better.

951
