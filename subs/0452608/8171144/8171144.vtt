1
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.880
Damn it!

2
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.740
Rear armor?
Shot to hell!

3
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.060
You better drop back..

4
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.830
It's the last lap
We can win this.

5
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.000
Why don't the son of a bitch just die?

6
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.130
Oil

7
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.270
Out

8
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.900
Smoke!

9
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.940
Finished!

10
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.700
Give me the napalm!
-Nothing works!

11
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.550
Drop the tombstone, on my mark

12
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.970
Three...

13
00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.480
Two...

14
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.690
One...

15
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.410
Got you now, motherfucker

16
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:04.790
Mark!

17
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.440
Shit!

18
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.940
Fuck!

19
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.810
Thats how you wanna do it?!
Okay!

20
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.230
He's still coming, our tank is exposed

21
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.150
He got us, Frank. You have to drop back

22
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.160
It's a quarter mile to the line, I can make it.

23
00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.800
Sayonara, Frankie

24
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.100
Punch out
I'm sorry

25
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.440
40 years...Longer than my marriage

26
00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.040
Sounds like you're gonna miss this place
Still can't believe they closed it down

27
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.920
Just like that

28
00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.130
The only thing I'm gonna miss
is my paycheck.

29
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.430
Well, it was an honest work
for honest men.

30
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.190
I got a family to feed.
Theres no work out there

31
00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.110
I heard that they might be hiring, down at the docks

32
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.160
5 men, maybe

33
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.420
Hey.. thanks man
Thanks Jensen

34
00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.460
Collect your final paycheck, and leave

35
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.720
The main gate will be locked in 15 minutes

36
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.410
Get ready to be ripped off boys

37
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:56.630
Collect your paychecks, and leave the premises in orderly manor
The main gate will be locked in 15 minutes

38
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:06.760
Cash or check?

39
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.090
Better make it cash.

40
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:11.910
Three hundred dollars..

41
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.380
I've worked 120 hours in the last two weeks.

42
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:16.420
Cash fee..Next!

43
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:17.640
Cash fee??

44
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.180
You wanted cash? There's a fee.  You want check instead..?

45
00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.900
Seeing as the company is out of business, not exactly.

46
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.990
You don't like it, there's the complaint box.

47
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.240
Next!

48
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.570
I never get it, self fulfilling prophecy

49
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.610
We're honest workers, we're just like you guys!

50
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.240
What the hell are you doing here?

51
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.500
Are you ok, Ross?

52
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:11.340
Hi honey.

53
00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.720
Sorry I'm so late.

54
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.850
Nice day at work?

55
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.260
Yeah... Just fine.

56
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:26.190
Give me that shirt.

57
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:33.290
They called the riot police, it got ugly.
I don't deserve you.

58
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:40.140
You're a good man, Jensen Ames
And it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks, but me.

59
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:51.080
So 300 dollars, thats all they gave us

60
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.180
We'll make it last,
We always do.

61
00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:57.600
I'm gonna start tomorrow

62
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.990
I think you're forgetting that I married you,
for your non-financial assets.

63
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.620
Did you now?

64
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:33.350
Daddy's home

65
00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:35.810
Is it you who's making all that noise?

66
00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.030
What does little Piper want?
You want a story?

67
00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.290
You know you won't understand it..

68
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.340
..But it'll be good practice for me.

69
00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:55.860
What the hell..

70
00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.160
Let's go crazy.

71
00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.610
Something smells good

72
00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.090
Honey!

73
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.100
Suzy!

74
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:45.620
Stay on the ground!

75
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:47.710
Stay where you are!

76
00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.000
Don't move!

77
00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.120
Get up against the wall.

78
00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.260
Stop!

79
00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:23.730
Prisoner, step back

80
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:36.050
Happy Holidays.

81
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:15.060
Good morning
Good morning, Warden

82
00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:19.190
Good morning, Ma'am

83
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:23.760
There goes the baddest ass in the yard

84
00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.760
Sounds like you in love, homie.

85
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:27.630
I am.

86
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.460
Damn, I had to wake up for this..

87
00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.310
Is it my imagination, or is
this shit getting worse?

88
00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:52.150
Whats this supposed to be?

89
00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:54.110
Oatmeal

90
00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.280
I think..

91
00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:58.540
How do you fuck up oatmeal?

92
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:03.130
Who's the new guy?

93
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.640
Jensen Ames
The driver?

94
00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.060
Never heard of him.

95
00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:11.820
Oh yeah. I saw him race years ago. He was good.

96
00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:13.910
He did some time upstate.

97
00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:15.870
Killed his career.

98
00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:20.010
Holder of the fastest laps at Willard, Union, and Butler.

99
00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:23.970
I hope he's as fast off the track as he is on.

100
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.180
Never a dull day

101
00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:52.830
Let's get the fuck out of here.

102
00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:01.350
Heads up, its Pachenko

103
00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.350
So you're the wife killer?

104
00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:19.560
It takes a big man, to kill a woman..

105
00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:26.000
Suppose you rape kiddies too

106
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.090
You hear that everyone?

107
00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.050
The guy kills women...rapes kiddies.

108
00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:37.020
What do you think we gonna do about that?

109
00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:51.640
Get on the ground, now!

110
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:53.560
Nobody move!

111
00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.700
Nobody move!

112
00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:04.800
I guess he didn't like the oatmeal either.

113
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:12.980
Prisoner No. 77119, ma'am.

114
00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:15.700
Thank you, Mr. Ulrich

115
00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:20.370
This prison is the home to murderers, rapists..

116
00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.510
..And violent offenders of every kind.

117
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:27.850
The United States Penal System sends me the worst of the worst.

118
00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:33.650
But the men you've provoked..
Well, let's just say Mr. Ames

119
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:37.460
that the life term you've joined us for may be
a lot shorter than you think.

120
00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:44.060
I understand tradition. Soften up the new guy
And a slipping good time had by all.

121
00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:54.580
Foul language is an issue.. for me.

122
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:11.410
While looking over your record,
I couldn't help noticing your occupational history.

123
00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:14.590
It seems you have some talent behind the wheel.

124
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:22.310
Out of curiosity, when was the last time you raced?

125
00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:26.780
It's been a while.
I lost my license.

126
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:29.410
What if I could help you?

127
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:32.210
Get my license back?

128
00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:35.720
I had something else in mind.

129
00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:43.660
You're familiar with the Death Race,
and the driver the fans call Frankenstein?

130
00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:48.630
A man so disfigured by crashes,
that he's forced to wear a mask.

131
00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:52.430
His return to the track is highly anticipated..

132
00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.850
And therein lies my problem.

133
00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:59.320
No one knows yet, but poor Frank died on an operating table

134
00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.410
Not long after his last race.

135
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:06.880
Anyone can wear the mask,
But not just anyone can drive the car.

136
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:12.350
You have the skills required to keep the legend alive.

137
00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.570
I want you to become Frankenstein.

138
00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:20.700
No thanks.

139
00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:23.500
He's dead.

140
00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.010
Why don't you just tell the truth?

141
00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:30.430
The audience wants to see Frank again.

142
00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.820
He moves them. Inspires them.

143
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.780
And in this world that's not so easy to come by.

144
00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:47.720
What makes you think for a second,
I would risk my life doing this for you?

145
00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:53.110
Win five races, you go free.

146
00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.080
Those are the rules

147
00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:59.000
And Frank has won four.

148
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:05.350
Win one more, you walk.

149
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:07.860
Call it intuition, but

150
00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:14.750
I don't think you belong in here with the rest of these animals.

151
00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:20.260
I might surprise you.

152
00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:36.460
The race is Friday, and I need your decision.

153
00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.230
You're a skilled driver.
Your chances are good

154
00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:45.150
I'm offering you your freedom, Mr. Ames.

155
00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:51.080
If it's not worth risking your life for,
what is?

156
00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:08.620
Now turn her up, and tie the lines.

157
00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:16.850
Ma'am
You don't have to call me Ma'am, you know that.

158
00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:19.270
This is Mr Ames

159
00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.150
You know why he's here.

160
00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:22.870
I do now..

161
00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:26.460
Race is less than a week away

162
00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.460
I have great confidence in you.

163
00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.270
Well then, I'll leave you two to get acquaintant.

164
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:40.570
Jensen Garner Ames.
Moved to the states at twenty-four years old.

165
00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.290
Named after a car, the Jensen Intercepter.

166
00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:48.850
A three time local speedway champion.
You've done your homework, or do you just know everything?

167
00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:54.980
Jensen Intercepter. I had one.
Handled like a school bus.

168
00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.700
Call me Coach, everyone does.

169
00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:01.420
Gunner.. Lists.

170
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.180
This's Frank.

171
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:06.850
I'll show you around

172
00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:12.030
We have a fully functioning autoshop.
Just like you'd find in the outside world.

173
00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:17.870
Each team has their own shop.
We don't help them, They don't help us.

174
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.710
With the inmates you're Jensen Ames, new greasemonkey.

175
00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.240
Nobody will know you're Frank, except us on the team, and a handful of the guards.

176
00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.360
Nobody will talk.

177
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:27.940
How can you be so sure?
-Hennessey..

178
00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:32.200
In here, she's Judge, Jury and Executioner

179
00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.200
The race is her baby.
Anyone who threatens it, she kills.

180
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:39.800
The audience for the race is half,
since Frank has been out of the game

181
00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.890
And so is the corporations profit
Thats why she needs you.

182
00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:46.440
What's back there?

183
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.240
Thats a good question.

184
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.370
Hennessey has had a whole wing of the prison in isolation for a month.

185
00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:55.540
Working on something.

186
00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:58.090
Time to meet the monster.

187
00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:09.120
Mustang V8 Fastback
Took the best, and made it better.

188
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:14.010
That's a V8 Rouch 5.4 liter, with a Ford Racing supercharger.

189
00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:16.760
Putting out 850 horsepower, and close to..

190
00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:20.140
750lbs. of torque with sequential module port fuel injection.

191
00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.450
Looks like there's a 250HP NOS unit.

192
00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:26.700
Just in case.

193
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:33.590
Then we had some fun,
Customizing a personal protection package.

194
00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.730
3 quarter inch steel plate, front, sides.

195
00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:41.780
Bulletproof glasses will here.. here.. and there.

196
00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:52.010
And in the rear.. the 6 inch solid steel shield we call
'The Tombstone'

197
00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:58.440
Oil.. Smoke
And napalm for defence.

198
00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:02.750
Twin 30mm belt fed machine guns for offense.

199
00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.120
So where's the ammo?

200
00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.300
We get that on race day.

201
00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:11.140
Pity.
Yeah, everyone thinks that...the first time.

202
00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:12.180
Thinks what?

203
00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:15.320
About turning the guns on the guards. About escaping.

204
00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:17.410
No, I wasn't thinking that.

205
00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:22.840
Well I'm glad, because Hennessey's got electric kill switches on all the guns on all the cars.

206
00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:28.270
And all the guard towers are fortified,
and their guns are bigger than your guns.

207
00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:33.320
Oh, did I mention the helicopters and also the fact that
we're on an island here a mile from the nearest shoreline?

208
00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:37.660
The only way in or out of here is on that one skinny bridge you came in on.

209
00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:54.740
What's that?
The most important part of the car.

210
00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:20.470
The race takes place in 3 stages over 3 days.

211
00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:24.150
The first two stages you just gotta try
and get rid of as much of the competition as you can.

212
00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:26.570
While getting your own skinny ass over the line alive.

213
00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:31.500
Third stage is where speed counts
First one over that line wins.

214
00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:36.130
Tomorrow morning you'll meet your navigator Case.

215
00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:41.560
She'll help you navigate the course, reload your weapons,
and help with the running of the car.

216
00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.240
I'd like to talk to her ahead of time before the race.

217
00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:47.540
Yeah, I'd like a big-tittied girl to lick peanut butter off my toes.
But it ain't gonna happen.

218
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.420
This is still a prison, man. She's a chick.

219
00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:53.220
They get bussed in from the women's facility upstate.

220
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:56.720
It's all about ratings. Fast cars, pretty women...

221
00:26:56.770 --> 00:27:01.150
Machine Gun Joe's the only one that has male navigators,
'cause he's gay.

222
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:05.700
Actually it's because he goes through them so fast,
and audience gets squeamish.

223
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.040
Yeah he goes through them...through their ass.

224
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:14.350
He cuts each kill into his skin as a souvenir, right here.

225
00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:16.150
What about the rest of the drivers?

226
00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:17.360
Lists?

227
00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:20.070
14K

228
00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:24.290
First generation Chinese-american.
10th generation Triad.

229
00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:29.340
His father sent him to business school
He's the only man in here who holds a degree from the MIT

230
00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:33.690
He's killed 4 men off the track (That we know of)
Another 7 on it.

231
00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:36.610
Hector Grimm, The Grimm Reaper.

232
00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:41.790
The man is a master. clinical psychopath.
Three time consecutive life sentences.

233
00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:46.220
He's killed 6 men off the track,
Another 12 on it.

234
00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:50.480
You've already met the local chapter of
The Brotherhood.

235
00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:54.530
Their driver, Pachenko, has killed 9 men on the track.

236
00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:56.450
Nobody knows how many off.

237
00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:01.340
Travis Colt, our local superstar.

238
00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:04.010
Used to race for NASCAR.
-Yeah,he was good too.

239
00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:09.060
Until he fell asleep behind the wheel of his Mercedez,
with the help of a bottle of scotch and a handful of ludes.

240
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:13.450
Wiped out the entire patio of Moscala, sent a dozen people to the hospital...

241
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:15.330
Killed three of them.

242
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:20.260
Technically, best driver in here but
a mean son of a bitch quitter.

243
00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:21.260
Ladies..

244
00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:30.490
I hear your man Frank's still in the infirmary with
15 unhealed fractures

245
00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:33.660
I also hear he's not gonna make the race.

246
00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:35.290
You hear a lot.

247
00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:38.260
Who's the new fish?

248
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:40.010
Greasemonkey.

249
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.140
Well well. Monkey.

250
00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:49.160
I got a new name for you.. Igor

251
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:53.170
Because you about the ugliest motherfucker out here in this prison yo!

252
00:28:57.010 --> 00:28:58.050
It's funny, huh?

253
00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:08.700
You tell Frank when you see him
This race is between me and him.

254
00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:14.550
This time won't be infirmary, it'll be the morgue.

255
00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:17.430
I'll be sure to pass it on.

256
00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:22.950
Lets get out of here..

257
00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:28.460
Man, that's one angry homo.

258
00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:39.780
Who're they?

259
00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:42.080
Work detail..

260
00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:45.000
Get to work on the track,
for good behavior.

261
00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:47.840
Those are GPS tracking bracelets.

262
00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.510
In case someone decides to go for a swim..

263
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:39.260
The ring.

264
00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.230
This was the old Frank's.

265
00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:52.370
It got melted to his hand.

266
00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:25.200
Frankenstein! Frankenstein! Frankenstein!

267
00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:52.680
Asshole

268
00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:00.150
He's all yours.

269
00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:06.960
Don't talk to the other drivers. Frank never did.
Part of the mystique.

270
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.880
Let the mask do the work.

271
00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.640
Here comes trouble.

272
00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:56.740
Thats your girl.

273
00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.990
I'm Case.
Frank.

274
00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:33.790
Well you don't sound like Frank.

275
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.640
Don't sweat it, I know.
I drove with Frank.

276
00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:42.980
I'll watch your back.
Better then you watched his, I hope.

277
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:52.960
You're still here.. I guess I got to work
a little harder.

278
00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:55.340
Get back to your car, prisoner

279
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:01.330
You sure know how to make friends.

280
00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:08.750
Case, this is mirror glass. No one can see in,
so you might want to take the mask off.

281
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:10.250
Unless you like it under there..

282
00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.260
How the hell does he drive in that thing?

283
00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:21.580
What?

284
00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:23.640
You're better looking than the last Frank.

285
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:27.140
Few crashes should change that..

286
00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:32.860
Start the transmission.

287
00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.450
3, 2, 1

288
00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.040

Travis Colt!

302
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:30.650
Audience favorite Frankenstein resumes his bitter grudgematch with Machine Gun Joe!

303
00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:36.200
Frankenstein returns to the track after his 6 month absence!
-They've missed him.

304
00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.410
He's the man, that just won't die!

305
00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:44.510
12 millions hit, on his angle alone
And he hasn't even started the engine.

306
00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:47.850
We'll do 45 million viewers today.

307
00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:56.910
So what are you in for?
They say I killed a cop.

308
00:35:59.000 --> 00:35:59.880
Did you do it?

309
00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.710
Yeah.

310
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:03.550
Bad cop?

311
00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:05.720
Good cop..

312
00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:09.560
Lousy husband.

313
00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:14.450
Frank, Case.. you read me?
We hear you.

314
00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:17.120
This is a 3 lap race.

315
00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:20.250
Hennessey doesn't activate the weapons 'til lap 2.

316
00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:28.440
Remember it's first come, first serve. So it pays to be out in front.

317
00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.120
This is it.

318
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:35.950
Countdown

319
00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:55.110
Are you sure he can deliver?

320
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:12.080
Dive left toward 100 feet.

321
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.550
15 ... 20
Now

322
00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:29.070
Punch it, hard left up ahead.

323
00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.870
He seems to be handling himself.

324
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:11.830
Wakey!

325
00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:24.360
Fuck!

326
00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.090
We're being passed, you gotta catch up!

327
00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:42.480
Bro, I know what I'm doing!

328
00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:48.600
Man just leave them!
-Shut up man...I know what the hell I'm doin'!

329
00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:52.040
What you gonna do?

330
00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:08.870
You can't go head-to-head with Joe like this, he'll tear you apart.

331
00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:16.210
Listen to him, before you get us both killed.

332
00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:13.370
You read me?!

333
00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:19.920
There's a shortcut to the left.

334
00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:18.290
Case, help him out of there!

335
00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:21.750
There!

336
00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:30.180
You don't think I see that?!

337
00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:28.840
He's takin' a shortcut!

338
00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:51.080
Activate Swords and Shields.

339
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.250
Swords are the main guns.

340
00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:00.290
Shields trigger the napalm, oil and smoke.

341
00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:22.270
Activate Death Heads.

342
00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:25.280
Death Heads activated.

343
00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:32.830
Get it baby!

344
00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:58.140
Score that one for the Reaper, baby!

345
00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:04.450
Thank you!
-Don't mention it. -Come on it's all clear.

346
00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:15.530
Fuck you puto! Fuck you!

347
00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:19.660
Got guns!

348
00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:36.470
Oil!

349
00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:48.980
Damn!

350
00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:51.590
"Tu hermanos puto!" mother fucker!

351
00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:52.470
Oh yeah!

352
00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:54.720
What the fuck?!

353
00:42:58.040 --> 00:42:59.250
We gotta get back in the race!

354
00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:54.720
Fucking Reaper baby, can't kill me.

355
00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:57.060
You can burn me.

356
00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:00.510
You can fuckin' shoot me, but you just can't fuckin' kill me!

357
00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:13.300
Get that off my window when we get back.

358
00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.870
Streaming to 46 million viewers ma'am.

359
00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:26.250
I'm back!

360
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:47.340
Thanks
- My pleasure.

361
00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:48.810
Shield, up ahead!

362
00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:52.190
Son of a bitch!

363
00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:54.600
Just stole a Shield from Colt!

364
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:57.240
Defense weapons are on!

365
00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:02.990
Let him have it.

366
00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:05.160
Napalm won't fire!

367
00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:06.710
Smoke!

368
00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:14.130
Again?!

369
00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:12.090
No smoke, no oil...no napalm!

370
00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:22.300
Fuck man!

371
00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:29.350
Remember me motherfucker?!

372
00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:39.320
Coach!

373
00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:42.290
The Tombstone won't take much more of this!

374
00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:48.630
Frank, Case...those 50 caliber shells will be through the Tombstone in a matter of seconds.

375
00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:51.600
My advice...either lose him or kill him.

376
00:45:58.670 --> 00:45:59.990
Unhook the napalm.

377
00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:06.770
Get on my lap!

378
00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:07.520
What?

379
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:09.100
Get on my lap!

380
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:29.510
What the hell?

381
00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:35.290
Merry Christmas asshole!

382
00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:36.800
Aw shit!

383
00:46:58.730 --> 00:46:59.570
Nice work.

384
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:23.840
Where's he goin'?

385
00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:25.970
Shortcut! Punch it, we can beat him!

386
00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:37.770
Look out!

387
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.160
Grim, Colt, and Siad are gone.

388
00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.540
Six remaining drivers alive.

389
00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:01.840
Subscribe to stage 2 now.

390
00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:18.040
We have 14 hours gentlemen, so let's get to work.

391
00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:19.320
Starting with this...

392
00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:25.240
So what happened out there Case?
-Got distracted.

393
00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:26.970
He got distracted?

394
00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:38.630
Coach!

395
00:48:39.370 --> 00:48:40.920
What?!
-Look at this!

396
00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:42.630
Oil sprays were fine.

397
00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:45.260
Well I'll be damned.

398
00:48:55.410 --> 00:48:56.120
Stop

399
00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:20.130
What can I do for you Mr. Ames?

400
00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:25.140
You're all lucky a driver like me just happened to turn up in your prison when I did.

401
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:26.890
I'm more than lucky.

402
00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:29.090
I'm blessed.

403
00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:33.320
Sometimes it's like the right hand of God is sitting on my shoulder.

404
00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:38.560
I'm not racing tomorrow.

405
00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:41.690
Go fuck yourself.

406
00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:43.270
Wait.

407
00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:47.270
Take his shackles off.

408
00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:03.340
Excuse us Mr. Ulrich.

409
00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:08.730
And take Mr. James with you

410
00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:23.190
Do you recognize these people?

411
00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:28.610
Because your daughter will.  They're her new parents.

412
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.940
What's her name?

413
00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:33.160
Piper.

414
00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:37.710
That's the man she'll grow up calling daddy.

415
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:41.970
Unless you do something about it.

416
00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:44.750
Where's she now?

417
00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:48.090
Oh I'm sure I have her address around here somewhere.

418
00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:52.070
You're a smart man Mr. Ames.

419
00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:56.370
Play my game, we both go home happy.

420
00:50:57.670 --> 00:51:00.170
The man who killed my wife is in this prison.

421
00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:04.810
I wonder what he'll say when I ask him why he did it.

422
00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:09.780
Why don't you look in a mirror, and ask him.

423
00:51:11.410 --> 00:51:17.990
Poor Piper...Must be hard growing up without knowing.
That your father killed your mother.

424
00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:41.050
You wanted a monster?

425
00:51:42.550 --> 00:51:44.230
You've got one.

426
00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:05.290
She has your eye.

427
00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:10.870
They're her mother's.

428
00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:14.580
So why do you wear a number, Coach?

429
00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:17.090
Because I'm not a prisoner.

430
00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:21.930
I qualified for parole 3 years ago.

431
00:52:22.770 --> 00:52:29.360
I got as far as the gate.
They got a name for it...something or other -Syndrome.

432
00:52:31.450 --> 00:52:35.670
Simple fact is...the world's changed since I've been in here.

433
00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:37.970
Don't know it, don't much want to.

434
00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:41.600
But this? This I know.

435
00:52:41.790 --> 00:52:43.040
What'd they send you away for?

436
00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:46.280
Oh plenty...or nothing.

437
00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:49.700
To what do we owe the pleasure of your company?

438
00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:52.960
I killed my wife.

439
00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:54.790
Bullshit.

440
00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:59.390
You're a hard man but you ain't no wife killer.

441
00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:00.640
How do you know?

442
00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:02.940
I've met my share.

443
00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:06.530
And you, the way you look at her.

444
00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:09.240
Couldn't do that if you killed her mother.

445
00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:10.740
So...

446
00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:15.130
I say bullshit.

447
00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:18.990
Coach

448
00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:26.410
What would you say if I told you Hennessey had my wife killed?

449
00:53:27.490 --> 00:53:30.250
And me framed for it so she could bring me in here to be her Frankenstein.

450
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:33.630
What would you say to that bullshit?

451
00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:41.480
Her name was Suzy.

452
00:53:45.070 --> 00:53:47.160
Was always headed here, always knew.

453
00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:51.460
She didn't.

454
00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:57.760
She was my chance at something else.

455
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:06.030
That bitch took her away from me.

456
00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:27.740
The days may be long on the land which the Lord, I giveth thee.

457
00:54:57.760 --> 00:54:58.210
Kill...

458
00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:54.340
Thou shalt not...

459
00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:17.890
You should take a break, get some sleep.

460
00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:19.850
I'm okay Lists.

461
00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:28.620
Concentration for the race...
Concentration that's what you need.  You gotta get your rest.

462
00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:37.040
Maybe you're right.

463
00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.340
I'll take that break after all.

464
00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:47.890
Good call.

465
00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:51.140
Got can't grind for shit.

466
00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:24.800
Lookin' for me?

467
00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:29.510
Him him!

468
00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:41.230
You killed my wife!

469
00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:48.670
Well then...maybe I did.

470
00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:54.660
I don't care if the queen bitch wants to save you for the track.

471
00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:58.330
Nobody disrespects the Brotherhood and lives.

472
00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:01.340
Put him down.

473
00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:05.090
I'm gonna take your head.

474
00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:26.320
Who is this fuck?!

475
00:58:24.620 --> 00:58:25.750
Just let me go.

476
00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:28.380
Let me go man.

477
00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:34.230
I'll do anything.

478
00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:37.520
You're gonna die here.

479
00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:39.730
Fuck you!

480
00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:47.030
Now now boys.  Let's save that for the track...huh?

481
00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:13.300
Coach!

482
00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:15.140
Take a look at this!

483
00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:26.150
What the hell are they building here?

484
00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:32.400
You'll find out soon enough.

485
00:59:46.090 --> 00:59:47.000
Prisoner

486
00:59:51.050 --> 00:59:52.010
Time to get ready.

487
00:59:59.310 --> 01:00:02.350
Welcome to the next installment of Death Race.

488
01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:04.440
Stage 2 begins...

489
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:07.480
Grim, Cold and Siad are gone.

490
01:00:07.690 --> 01:00:09.360
6 remaining drivers alive.

491
01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:13.240
14K, Pachenko...

492
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:15.110
Riggins...

493
01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:17.240
Carson...

494
01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.990
3 time winner, Machine Gun Joe.

495
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:25.330
And starting from the back of the grid, his archrival Frankenstein.

496
01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:28.540
This could be the last time we see Frankenstein race.

497
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:31.420
Just one more victory and he wins his freedom.

498
01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:33.840
If Joe doesn't kill him first.

499
01:00:35.890 --> 01:00:38.430
Over 50 million viewers have already subscribed.

Subscribe to stage 2 now.

502
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:05.790
Pay attention.

503
01:01:18.390 --> 01:01:19.220
Where is he?

504
01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:24.560
What are you doing?

505
01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:29.100
What's he doing?

506
01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:36.200
He's dropping back.

507
01:01:39.450 --> 01:01:40.570
We're gonna have a little talk.

508
01:01:40.570 --> 01:01:43.080
We're gonna be done by the time we leave the tunnel.

509
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:48.460
What?

510
01:01:45.450 --> 01:01:46.620
Did you kill the old Frank?

511
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.250
Tunnel comes in fast.

512
01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.750
Remember what happened to that napalm canister?

513
01:01:57.090 --> 01:01:59.220
It'd be a real shame for that to happen to you.

514
01:02:04.270 --> 01:02:05.560
Did you kill the old Frank?

515
01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:10.310
I sabotaged his rear weapons.

516
01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:11.730
Why?

517
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:14.150
Hennessy...

518
01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:17.820
She said she signed my release papers.  It's my life back.

519
01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:21.450
I didn't kill him.

520
01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:20.110
And you killed him too...

521
01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:24.410
He wouldn't quit. I just wanted to make sure he didn't win.

522
01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:26.290
Why would Hennessy want that?

523
01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:29.370
To keep Frank here...racing.

524
01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:32.590
Yesterday?

525
01:02:33.290 --> 01:02:34.590
She wanted me to set you back.

526
01:02:35.050 --> 01:02:37.670
So...I'm not supposed to win either?

527
01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.760
Just to make it exciting.

528
01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:47.600
That's all I wanted to know.

529
01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:52.270
Hold tight.

530
01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:12.000
Come on! Lap 2!

531
01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:34.480
Damn!

532
01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:43.320
He's going after Pachenko.

533
01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:22.840
Shield ahead, take defense.

534
01:04:23.570 --> 01:04:24.320
No

535
01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.530
There's someone I need to kill.

536
01:04:31.370 --> 01:04:34.370
You're out in front, who you gonna shoot at?

537
01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:37.380
You're a dead man!

538
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:44.930
I told you to take defense!

539
01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:02.440
He's too heavily armored!

540
01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:08.660
Fuck!

541
01:05:11.490 --> 01:05:12.410
Hit the smoke.

542
01:06:02.550 --> 01:06:04.380
This is a race, you don't go backwards.

543
01:06:15.310 --> 01:06:17.020
You don't get out of the car.

544
01:06:30.070 --> 01:06:31.280
It was Hennessy...

545
01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:34.950
Hennessy!
-I know...she's next.

546
01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:51.340
Frank's out of his car.

547
01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:52.550
What?

548
01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:55.310
He stepped out of his car!
-Okay, I see it.

549
01:06:55.810 --> 01:06:58.390
I need guns.
-Yeah, Sword coming up in 50 yards.

550
01:07:02.730 --> 01:07:05.320
What happened?
-I don't know, somebody must've grabbed them.

551
01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:07.440
What you mean somebody grabbed them?

552
01:07:07.650 --> 01:07:11.450
Look man...I thought it was lit.
-What you mean you thought?

553
01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:13.620
Man get the fuck outta my car!

554
01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:14.910
What?

555
01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:17.660
I said get the fuck outta my car!

556
01:07:34.970 --> 01:07:37.260
Hell no!

557
01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:38.770
Wait man, wait!

558
01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.770
Don't let me down boy...

559
01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:02.750
Release the Dreadnaught.

560
01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:14.720
Coach!

561
01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:27.650
Well I guess we know what she was buildin' now...

562
01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:37.450
Activate weapons.

563
01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:53.800
Christ!

564
01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:32.210
Coach, any ideas?
-Just have to tough it out I guess.

565
01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:35.880
Hennessy will take it off once she's pumped up the ratings.

566
01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:40.390
You sure about that?

567
01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:02.160
The hell is that thing going?

568
01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:08.480
Fuck me..

569
01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.120
Lists.

570
01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:26.540
Receiving?

571
01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:28.370
Need to patch me through to another car.

572
01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:29.670
On it...

573
01:11:36.050 --> 01:11:36.750
Joe!

574
01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:39.090
Who is this?

575
01:11:39.550 --> 01:11:41.090
-Frank
-What do you want?

576
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:43.220
How about we play a little offense?

577
01:11:46.930 --> 01:11:48.350
I hope you know what you're doing.

578
01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:10.970
Now that's entertainment.

579
01:13:12.770 --> 01:13:13.600
Damn it!

580
01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:31.240
Frankenstein! Frankenstein!

581
01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:46.590
Nice reflexes there, Igor.

582
01:13:50.010 --> 01:13:51.680
Race car reflexes.

583
01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:55.270
You look lost pal.

584
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:57.350
Not this time.

585
01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:02.190
Got this feeling that you and Frank are close.

586
01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:05.320
Real close

587
01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:09.740
That weird accent, you even kind of sound like him.

588
01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:14.040
I was wondering...what if you...got in an accident.

589
01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:17.620
Would that throw Frank off his game a little bit?

590
01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:24.510
I doubt it. The sick fucked up guy that he is.

591
01:14:30.390 --> 01:14:31.050
He's cool.

592
01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:26.550
He just want to kill you?

593
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:37.520
So I guess I'll...see him later, right?

594
01:14:41.190 --> 01:14:42.690
Let's roll.

595
01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:04.000
Ma'am with all respect...

596
01:15:05.250 --> 01:15:08.590
What're we going to do?
-We're going to kill him of course.

597
01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:10.890
You want me to kill Frankenstein?

598
01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:14.010
Don't be stupid.  Frankenstein can't die.

599
01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:17.220
After all, he's just a mask.

600
01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:47.760
Tonight is the final leg of the Death Race.

601
01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:51.930
And perhaps a new champion will arise.

602
01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:54.260
A five times winner.

603
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:58.640
The first man ever to gain his freedom.

604
01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:04.360
The world gave you to me because you are not fit to be a part of it.

605
01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:10.820
You are not fit to be husbands.  You are not fit to be fathers.

606
01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:16.080
And were to dangerous to live with the rest of us.

607
01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:18.790
What is this shit, man?

608
01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:21.910
But when you race tonight.

609
01:16:22.410 --> 01:16:25.670
Know that the eyes of the world are upon you.

610
01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:59.410
And know that the very same world that rejected you, now lives and breathes with you.

611
01:16:59.870 --> 01:17:03.750
And it draws inspiration from your courage.

612
01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:06.710
No one's ever gonna win 5 races.

613
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:08.540
So...race well.

614
01:17:09.210 --> 01:17:11.170
Nobody's ever getting out of here.

615
01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:15.010
And know that I consider you all, my heroes.

616
01:17:26.850 --> 01:17:28.560
I wanna show you something.

617
01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:33.690
Can't kill me...

618
01:17:33.690 --> 01:17:35.110
I'm the fucking Reaper.

619
01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:42.160
You can burn me, you can shoot me.

620
01:17:42.910 --> 01:17:44.410
But you can't fucking-

621
01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:02.260
Gunner, Lists...

622
01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:45.540
There...

623
01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:06.600
Will Hennessy's inspectors care if we add a half gallon of reserve tank?

624
01:18:07.150 --> 01:18:10.360
Another half gallon?
You got a fuel tank that holds 35 gallons.

625
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:12.690
What the hell do you want another half gallon for?

626
01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:15.280
Coach.

627
01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.450
Let's give the man what he wants.

628
01:18:21.410 --> 01:18:22.370
Where are you going?

629
01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:31.960
This is not good

630
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:48.850
Real brave coming over here.

631
01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:58.860
I'm gonna win this race, because I want out of this shit hole.

632
01:19:00.450 --> 01:19:06.620
I've already won 3 races. Two more, and I'm smoking cohebas in Miami.

633
01:19:10.290 --> 01:19:12.420
Frank might wanna think about that.

634
01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:16.710
Because I'm gone...outta here.

635
01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:20.340
Then maybe it's his turn.

636
01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:23.050
Maybe he's thinking it's the other way around.

637
01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:31.900
From here on out, stay the fuck out of my pit.

638
01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:42.070
Hey!

639
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:47.080
Think you and Frank should have a little talk.

640
01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:56.710
Welcome to the final installment of Death Race.

641
01:19:57.170 --> 01:19:58.630
Seven men dead.

642
01:19:58.880 --> 01:19:59.840
Siad

643
01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:00.930
Grim

644
01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:02.390
Colt

645
01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:03.480
Pachenko

646
01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:05.020
Carson

647
01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:09.660
Riggins, and 14K are all dead.

648
01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:13.330
Just Frankenstein and Machine Gun Joe survived.

649
01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:15.790
Frank racing for his freedom.

650
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.640
And Joe doing anything to stop him.

651
01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:22.110
It's "mano e mano" and there will be no mercy.

652
01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:25.990
Tonight, only one man will walk off this track alive.

653
01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:28.830
A record 70 million are already watching.

654
01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:32.710
Join them! Subscribe to the final stage now!

655
01:20:36.630 --> 01:20:38.130
It's an honor to navigate for you Sir.

656
01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:41.970
We won't have time to get acquainted.

657
01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:39.880
They call me Nathan
-Save it...

658
01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:46.720
The hell are those?

659
01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:50.470
Model 7 Russian State's Armory RPGs.

660
01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:54.690
Armor piercing, self arming...accurate to a thousand yards.

661
01:20:56.610 --> 01:20:57.520
That's what I thought.

662
01:21:04.450 --> 01:21:05.910
Prisoner, step back.

663
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:19.090
I thought maybe you could use a little inspiration.

664
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:25.180
Your release papers.

665
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:29.510
All you have to do is walk off that track alive.

666
01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:32.350
Well...and win of course.

667
01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:45.610
But if you do win, I want you to think about staying here.

668
01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:50.490
As Frankenstein.

669
01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:53.040
Pfft...yeah.

670
01:21:54.290 --> 01:21:55.830
I can see the appeal.

671
01:21:57.580 --> 01:22:00.210
What would you do with your freedom?

672
01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:02.590
Go back to your daughter?

673
01:22:03.130 --> 01:22:04.380
That's the idea.

674
01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:10.050
The thing is...are you really the best future she could possibly have?

675
01:22:11.970 --> 01:22:16.480
Are you really daddy material, or deep down are you something else?

676
01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:26.030
If you decided that out there on that track is where you belong.

677
01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:33.160
It would be the most unselfish act of love, I've ever seen.

678
01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:39.040
Just something to think about.

679
01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:22.170
What's this?
-Small modification.

680
01:23:24.090 --> 01:23:26.050
So Hennessy tells me, if you're going to win.

681
01:23:26.410 --> 01:23:27.710
I'm supposed to stop you.

682
01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:29.800
Oh yeah?
-Yeah.

683
01:23:32.210 --> 01:23:34.390
Sounds like the odds are staked against us.

684
01:23:34.970 --> 01:23:36.140
Then do what you do best.

685
01:23:38.930 --> 01:23:39.640
Drive.

686
01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:54.620
Gentlemen, this should be interesting.

687
01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:20.180
Lit Sword up ahead.

688
01:24:20.730 --> 01:24:21.730
Deactivate that.

689
01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:23.520
Sir?
-Just do it.

690
01:24:25.650 --> 01:24:26.440
Push it back on.

691
01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:28.780
Weapons are up!

692
01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:30.610
Damn it!

693
01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:42.330
Shit

694
01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:45.580
Lit Shield up ahead.

695
01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:51.050
Damn it!

696
01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:53.430
What happened?
-Hennessy must've deactivated it.

697
01:24:53.630 --> 01:24:54.510
Bitch!

698
01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:02.390
Light me up!

699
01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:10.780
It's party time.

700
01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:43.640
Coach, we gotta get some fire power.

701
01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:45.850
Nothing lit for a half lap.

702
01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:47.230
We won't last that long!

703
01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:28.150
Drop the Tombstone.
-What?

704
01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:29.560
Do it.

705
01:26:34.150 --> 01:26:35.070
On my mark.

706
01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:36.530
Three ...

707
01:26:38.490 --> 01:26:39.450
Two ...

708
01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:41.830
One ...

709
01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:45.040
Mark!

710
01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:49.790
Damn it!

711
01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:53.880
That shit don't work twice playboy!

712
01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:01.890
Shit!

713
01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:03.680
Shield at a quarter lap.

714
01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:07.230
You hear that? Lit Shield at a quarter lap.

715
01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:23.200
He's coming up fast!

716
01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:26.160
Let them get the Shield.

717
01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:27.910
Keep the viewers interested.

718
01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:40.090
Son of a bitch, he got the Shield.

719
01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:50.020
Arm the explosive...Just in case.

720
01:27:57.230 --> 01:27:58.360
Yo Franken'freak!

721
01:27:58.530 --> 01:28:01.990
This Villager's got a pitch fork, and it's headed straight up your ass!

722
01:28:29.140 --> 01:28:30.100
What just happened?

723
01:28:38.190 --> 01:28:40.490
Yeah boy!

724
01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:44.300
They're off the track. They're escaping!

725
01:28:44.410 --> 01:28:45.410
They're headed for the bridge.

726
01:28:45.950 --> 01:28:47.410
Their weapons, hit the killswitches!

727
01:28:51.330 --> 01:28:53.620
Seventy million viewers ma'am, they're all watching!

728
01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:56.000
Shut the webcast down!

729
01:28:56.250 --> 01:28:59.000
Shut it down!
-Shut the fucking computers down now!

730
01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:05.510
Get out, get out, get out now!

731
01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:06.390
Get out!

732
01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:17.190
Yo Frankenstein, it's good we had that little talk.

733
01:29:20.650 --> 01:29:22.440
You gave that bitch a good show huh?

734
01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:29.910
Give me that!

735
01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:32.250
Okay cock sucker.

736
01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:37.420
Fuck with me, and we'll see who shits on the sidewalk!

737
01:29:41.300 --> 01:29:42.880
Somebody's mad right now...

738
01:29:43.300 --> 01:29:44.930
Nobody fucks with my car.

739
01:29:47.140 --> 01:29:48.100
Son of a bitch!

740
01:29:48.890 --> 01:29:50.010
Get the choppers in the air!

741
01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:13.500
We're not gonna get very far.

742
01:30:13.790 --> 01:30:14.500
You're right

743
01:30:24.050 --> 01:30:25.130
Now would be a good time?

744
01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:48.610
Very nice modification.

745
01:30:51.410 --> 01:30:54.910
That extra half gallon reserve tank should see you through to the finish.

746
01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:58.920
Bon voyage, Frank

747
01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:32.070
Choppers have a visual, ma'am.

748
01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:46.300
Joe?

749
01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:05.730
Give me a pilot, I need to talk to a pilot right now.

750
01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:08.690
You're on.

751
01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:10.360
Stay with Frankenstein, don't lose him!

752
01:32:18.830 --> 01:32:22.540
Sure you're up for this?
-I'm sure, I owe it to Frank.

753
01:32:23.130 --> 01:32:26.960
Besides, Hennessy already gave me my release papers. They have to left me out.

754
01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:40.120
They stopped him, ma'am.

755
01:34:14.610 --> 01:34:18.620
Keep your hands where we can see them.
You are under arrest

756
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:24.830
I repeat: keep your hands where we can see them.
You are under arrest

757
01:34:30.090 --> 01:34:33.010
Hey Igor, Merry Christmas.

758
01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:44.100
Let's get out of here.

759
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:09.670
Nice.

760
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:14.630
The fact that you have clothes like these, makes a man question you're-

761
01:35:14.710 --> 01:35:15.590
My taste.

762
01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:16.800
Yeah, so to speak.

763
01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:19.180
I don't know about you but I'm headed to Miami.

764
01:35:19.390 --> 01:35:20.260
Yeah, Miami's good.

765
01:35:22.180 --> 01:35:23.180
I'll meet you down there.

766
01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:36.860
It's a shame I didn't get to take care of that bitch, Hennessy.

767
01:35:25.180 --> 01:35:26.480
Once I got my baby girl.

768
01:35:37.110 --> 01:35:39.740
Yeah, it is a shame.

769
01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:56.460
Frankenstein has been retrieved.
And ma'am...ratings are off the charts.

770
01:35:57.130 --> 01:35:59.760
Gifts and congratulations are already coming in.

771
01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:03.100
You win again.

772
01:36:04.260 --> 01:36:05.470
Mr. Ulrich...

773
01:36:07.890 --> 01:36:09.060
I always win.

774
01:36:12.190 --> 01:36:12.980
Damn...

775
01:36:21.410 --> 01:36:22.870
I love this game

776
01:36:56.230 --> 01:36:57.820
So we had to fix this car?

777
01:36:58.530 --> 01:37:02.240
Don't know how many times we're gonna keep doing this.

778
01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:04.870
Damn it!

779
01:37:05.870 --> 01:37:08.620
You say you want me to live a life of an honest man, huh?

780
01:37:08.910 --> 01:37:10.540
Yeah, you better get used to it.

781
01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:17.840
Igor!

782
01:38:00.750 --> 01:38:01.710
What took you so long?

783
01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:03.670
Had trouble getting my release papers approved.

784
01:38:04.130 --> 01:38:05.720
Wait here, there's someone I want you to meet.

785
01:38:11.180 --> 01:38:15.600
Look at her...she has beautiful eyes.

786
01:38:15.810 --> 01:38:16.690
They're her mothers.

787
01:38:17.230 --> 01:38:18.230
Where'd you get the rims?

788
01:38:19.150 --> 01:38:21.900
I won it...card game.
-Yeah right...

789
01:38:22.110 --> 01:38:22.900
No really!

790
01:38:25.650 --> 01:38:26.490
500...

791
01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:25.650
How many horse power is in this engine?

792
01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:31.990
Someone once asked me, did I think I was the best future for my little girl.

793
01:38:33.790 --> 01:38:37.080
No one in this world is perfect. Heaven knows, I'm not.

794
01:38:38.420 --> 01:38:41.000
But I love her more than anyone else possibly could.

795
01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:43.300
In the end...

796
01:38:49.760 --> 01:39:49.760
