00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.671
(drumroll)

2
00:00:06.047 --> 00:00:08.591
(rousing orchestral
fanfare playing)

3
00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.354
(fanfare ends)

4
00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:20.622
(sniffing)

5
00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:27.879
(thump)

6
00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:06.626
(screams)

7
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.467
(wails)

8
00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.222
(screams)

9
00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:27.147
(continues screaming)

10
00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:37.407
(screams)

11
00:02:44.747 --> 00:02:47.959
(screaming)

12
00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:56.801
Ohh!

13
00:02:57.343 --> 00:03:00.221
(squawks)

14
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.384
(groaning)

15
00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:46.684
(continues groaning)

16
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:57.195
Well, why not call it
the Big Chill or the Nippy Era?

17
00:03:57.278 --> 00:04:00.323
I'm just sayin',
how do we know it's an Ice Age?

18
00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:03.243
Because of all the ice!

19
00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:07.705
Well, things
just got a little chillier.

20
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:11.834
-Help! Help!
-Help! Help!

21
00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:15.046
Come on, kids, let's go!
The traffic's moving.

22
00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:16.965
But, but, but, Dad!

23
00:04:17.715 --> 00:04:20.385
No buts. You can
play extinction later.

24
00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:23.554
Aw, okay.
Come on, guys.

25
00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:26.182
So, where's Eddie?

26
00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:28.434
He said something about
being on the verge,

27
00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:31.437
-of an evolutionary breakthrough.
-Really?

28
00:04:33.147 --> 00:04:35.775
Oh, I'm flying!

29
00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:38.569
Some breakthrough.

30
00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:40.822
-(gasps)
-Look out!

31
00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:43.658
-You're going the wrong way!
-(shouting)

32
00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:45.410
Raging mammoth!

33
00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:57.338
Hey, do the world a favor!
Move your issues off the road!

34
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.634
If my trunk was that small,
I wouldn't draw attention to myself, pal.

35
00:05:02.343 --> 00:05:05.555
Give me a break.
We... We've been waddlin' all day.

36
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.476
Oh, go ahead.
Follow the crowd.

37
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.437
It'll be quieter when you're gone.

38
00:05:13.604 --> 00:05:16.149
Ah, come on.
If he wants to freeze to death, let him.

39
00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:24.490
(snoring)

40
00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:25.742
(yelps)
Huh?

41
00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:27.910
Hey, hey, I'm up.
I'm up.

42
00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:32.957
Hey, rise and shine, everybody.

43
00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:36.252
Huh? Zak? Marshall?

44
00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.422
Bertie? Uncle Fungus?

45
00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:42.592
Where is everybody?
Come on, guys.

46
00:05:42.675 --> 00:05:46.304
We're gonna miss the mi...
the mi... the migration.

47
00:05:46.387 --> 00:05:48.681
(cricket chirping)

48
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.558
They left without me.

49
00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:53.353
They do this every year.

50
00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:58.191
Why? Doesn't anyone love me?

51
00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:03.154
Isn't there anyone
who cares about Sid the Sloth?

52
00:06:05.823 --> 00:06:07.617
All right,
I'll just go by myself.

53
00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:11.746
-(squish)
-Oh, sick.

54
00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:15.166
Hey, wide body!
Curb it next time!

55
00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:17.585
Oh, jeez. Oh, yuck! Oh!

56
00:06:18.002 --> 00:06:20.755
I can't believe it.
Fresh wild greens.

57
00:06:20.838 --> 00:06:24.675
-Frank, where did you ever?
-Go ahead. Dig in.

58
00:06:25.676 --> 00:06:28.388
A dandelion!
I thought the frost wiped 'em all out.

59
00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:29.972
All but one.

60
00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:35.812
Oh, it makes me so...
Oh, I... Oh, yuck!

61
00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:37.730
This has definitely
not been my day.

62
00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:39.440
I mean, you know
what I'm saying, buddy?

63
00:06:40.441 --> 00:06:44.112
Oh, what a mess. Hey, you rhinos,
you know, you have really tiny brains.

64
00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:46.489
Did you know that?
No, it's just a fact. No offense.

65
00:06:46.864 --> 00:06:48.324
You probably don't even know
what I'm talkin' about.

66
00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:51.077
(chuckles)
Oh, yummo!

67
00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:57.041
A dandelion. Must be the last one
of the season. Mmm! Mmm!

68
00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:59.085
-Mmm!
-Carl?

69
00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:02.213
-Easy, Frank.
-He ruined our salad.

70
00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:05.258
Oh, oh, my mistake, fellas.
My mistake.

71
00:07:05.341 --> 00:07:07.885
I mean, let me, let me...
No, no, seriously, I...

72
00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:10.680
Let me take care of this.
W-What? What is this?

73
00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:14.600
Pine cones!
Oh, my goodness! They're my favorite.

74
00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:17.603
Mmm! Delicious.

75
00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:21.065
Ow. Uh, that's uh, good eatin'.

76
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:23.609
But don't let me
hog them all up. Oh, no.

77
00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:25.945
Here, you have some.
Tasty, isn't it?

78
00:07:26.362 --> 00:07:27.530
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

79
00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:29.949
Now?

80
00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:32.577
Now.

81
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.787
(screaming)

82
00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:39.584
Hey!

83
00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:42.128
(hoofbeats)

84
00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:46.507
-Just pretend that I'm not here.
-Man, I wanted to hit him at full speed.

85
00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:49.260
That's okay, Frank.
We'll have some fun with him.

86
00:07:49.343 --> 00:07:52.054
Don't let them impale me.
Please. I want to live!

87
00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:55.141
-Get off me.
-Come on. You're making a scene.

88
00:07:55.224 --> 00:07:58.352
Uh-huh. We'll just take our furry piñata
and go, if you don't mind.

89
00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:01.647
Hey, buddy, if it's not them today,
it's just someone else tomorrow.

90
00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:04.025
Well, I'd rather it
not be today, okay?

91
00:08:04.108 --> 00:08:07.612
Look, we're gonna break your neck
so you don't feel a thing. How's that?

92
00:08:07.695 --> 00:08:10.698
Wait a minute. I thought
rhinos were vegetarians.

93
00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:12.492
-An excellent point.
-Shut up.

94
00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:15.495
Who says we're gonna
eat him after we kill him?

95
00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:16.537
Yeah, come on, move it.

96
00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:19.582
You know, I don't like animals
that kill for pleasure.

97
00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:22.752
-Save it for a mammal that cares.
-I'm a mammal that cares.

98
00:08:23.419 --> 00:08:27.298
Okay, look, if either of you make it
across that sinkhole in front of you,

99
00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:28.466
you get the sloth.

100
00:08:28.549 --> 00:08:31.427
That's right, you losers.
You take one step, and you're dead!

101
00:08:36.682 --> 00:08:39.727
-You were bluffing, huh?
-Yeah. Yeah, that was a bluff.

102
00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:42.396
-Get him!
-Get him!

103
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:51.948
(screaming)

104
00:08:58.621 --> 00:08:59.872
Who-hoo!
(screams)

105
00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:15.471
(screams)

106
00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:20.601
A dandelion?

107
00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:26.232
Whoo-hoo! We did it!
We did it!

108
00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:30.027
-Wh... What?
-(screams)

109
00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:36.117
You have beautiful eyes.

110
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.661
Get off my face.

111
00:09:39.453 --> 00:09:40.788
Whoa. You and me,

112
00:09:40.871 --> 00:09:43.791
we make a great team. I mean,
whattaya say we just head south together.

113
00:09:43.874 --> 00:09:46.419
Great. Yeah. Hey, jump up
on my back and relax the whole way.

114
00:09:46.502 --> 00:09:48.337
-Wow, really?
-No.

115
00:09:48.796 --> 00:09:50.339
Wait.
Aren't you going south?

116
00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:53.092
The change of seasons?
Migration instincts?

117
00:09:53.175 --> 00:09:55.886
-Any of this ringin' a bell?
-I guess not. Bye.

118
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.472
Okay, then. Thanks for the help.
I can take it from here.

119
00:09:59.807 --> 00:10:01.726
Hey, you overgrown weasel!

120
00:10:02.059 --> 00:10:03.603
Wait till we get down there!

121
00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:06.188
Whoa! That whole south thing
is way overrated.

122
00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:08.858
The heat, the crowds. Who needs it?
I mean, isn't this great?

123
00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:12.528
You and me, two bachelors
knocking about in the wild.

124
00:10:12.945 --> 00:10:16.782
No, you just want a bodyguard so you don't
become somebody's side dish.

125
00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:19.201
You're a very shrewd mammal.

126
00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:22.330
Okay, then you lead the way,
Mr. Big, uh... I didn't get the name.

127
00:10:22.413 --> 00:10:24.248
-Manfred.
-Manfred? Yuck, man.

128
00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:26.125
How about Manny,
the Moody Mammoth?

129
00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:30.046
Or Manny the Melancholy...
Manny the... (gasps)

130
00:10:32.214 --> 00:10:33.716
Stop following me.

131
00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:37.345
Okay, okay,
so you've got issues.

132
00:10:37.428 --> 00:10:39.889
Look, you won't even know I'm here.
I'll just zip the lip.

133
00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:41.599
'Cause when I say "mmm,"
I'm "mmm."

134
00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:22.390
(baby laughing)

135
00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:29.689
MALE VOICE: Oh, look at the cute
little baby, Diego.

136
00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:35.152
Isn't it nice
he'll be joining us for breakfast?

137
00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:37.571
It wouldn't be breakfast
without him.

138
00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:40.991
Especially since
his daddy wiped out half our pack

139
00:11:41.075 --> 00:11:43.035
and wears our skin
to keep warm.

140
00:11:43.452 --> 00:11:46.622
An eye for an eye.
Don't you think?

141
00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:50.418
Let's show that human what happens
when he messes with sabers.

142
00:11:50.501 --> 00:11:53.295
Alert the troops.
We attack at dawn.

143
00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:59.051
And, Diego, bring me
that baby... alive.

144
00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.846
If I'm gonna enjoy my revenge,

145
00:12:02.304 --> 00:12:04.056
I want it to be fresh.

146
00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:23.617
Ohh!
(panting)

147
00:12:25.828 --> 00:12:28.038
Whew. I'm wiped out.

148
00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:29.623
That's your shelter?

149
00:12:30.082 --> 00:12:33.169
Hey, you're a big guy.
You got a lot of wood. I'm a little guy.

150
00:12:33.252 --> 00:12:34.253
You got half a stick.

151
00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:38.966
Yeah, but with my little stick,
and my highly evolved brain... Ow!

152
00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:41.343
I shall create fire.

153
00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:42.928
Fascinating.

154
00:12:44.054 --> 00:12:48.058
We'll see if brains triumph over brawn
tonight, now, won't we?

155
00:12:48.934 --> 00:12:51.812
(thunder crashing)

156
00:12:53.564 --> 00:12:55.357
Hey, I think
I saw a spark.

157
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:03.616
Uh, any chance I could squeeze in there
with you, Manny, old pal?

158
00:13:03.699 --> 00:13:06.202
Oh, isn't there
someone else you can annoy?

159
00:13:06.702 --> 00:13:10.080
Friends, family,
poisonous reptiles?

160
00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:11.916
Oh, my family abandoned me.

161
00:13:12.249 --> 00:13:14.502
They just kinda migrated
without me.

162
00:13:15.336 --> 00:13:18.923
You should see what they did last year.
They woke up early,

163
00:13:19.006 --> 00:13:20.966
and then they quietly tied
my hands and feet

164
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.343
and they gagged me with a field mouse...

165
00:13:22.426 --> 00:13:24.887
and barricaded the cave door
and covered their tracks...

166
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:29.099
and went through water
so I'd lose their scent and, and, and...

167
00:13:29.183 --> 00:13:32.478
-And who needs 'em anyway.
-(thunder crashing)

168
00:13:34.855 --> 00:13:36.315
So what about you?
You have family?

169
00:13:41.445 --> 00:13:44.031
Okay, you're tired. I see.
Well, we'll talk more in the morning.

170
00:13:44.698 --> 00:13:46.867
Ow! Ow!
Ah, ah! Ow! Ow!

171
00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:50.538
Uh, Manfred? Manfred?
Could you scooch over a drop?

172
00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:54.083
Oh, come on!
Nobody falls asleep that fast!

173
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.835
Manny!

174
00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:10.641
(straining, panting)

175
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.128
(groans)

176
00:15:00.774 --> 00:15:03.694
(growling)

177
00:15:05.529 --> 00:15:08.324
(barking)

178
00:15:09.116 --> 00:15:11.160
(barking continues)

179
00:15:11.243 --> 00:15:13.954
(calls out)

180
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.380
(growling, barking)

181
00:16:47.881 --> 00:16:49.800
There's Diego.
Fall back!

182
00:16:56.598 --> 00:16:59.476
-Where's the baby?
-I lost it over the falls.

183
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.853
You lost it?

184
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.734
I want that baby, Diego.

185
00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:08.694
-I'll get it.
-You'd better,

186
00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:11.530
unless you want to serve yourself
as a replacement.

187
00:17:11.613 --> 00:17:13.198
We'll go up to Half Peak.

188
00:17:13.824 --> 00:17:14.950
Meet us there.

189
00:17:16.243 --> 00:17:18.203
It had better be alive.

190
00:17:19.621 --> 00:17:21.665
Can we trust you with that, Diego?

191
00:17:22.082 --> 00:17:23.083
Let's go!

192
00:17:36.555 --> 00:17:37.681
(dog whimpers)

193
00:17:39.349 --> 00:17:42.186
(barking, shouting)

194
00:17:47.483 --> 00:17:49.526
And then she picked this hair
off my shoulder and says, "Look,

195
00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:51.361
if you're gonna have
an extra mating dance,

196
00:17:51.445 --> 00:17:53.614
at least pick a female
with the same color pelt."

197
00:17:53.697 --> 00:17:54.531
Right? And I thought,

198
00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:57.409
"Whoa, she's gonna go praying mantis
on me." You know what I'm sayin'.

199
00:17:57.493 --> 00:18:00.412
Hey, if you find a mate in life,
you should be loyal.

200
00:18:00.496 --> 00:18:02.581
In your case, grateful.
Now, get away from me.

201
00:18:02.664 --> 00:18:04.708
Well, I think, mating for life
is stupid.

202
00:18:04.792 --> 00:18:06.668
I mean, there's plenty of Sid
to go around, you know?

203
00:18:08.879 --> 00:18:09.713
Manny?

204
00:18:11.507 --> 00:18:12.341
Manny?

205
00:19:06.311 --> 00:19:09.189
Look at that.
He's okay.

206
00:19:21.076 --> 00:19:22.327
She's gone.

207
00:19:33.213 --> 00:19:35.716
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Manny,
Manny, are you forgetting something?

208
00:19:35.799 --> 00:19:36.967
No.

209
00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:38.177
But-- but you just saved him.

210
00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:41.180
Yeah, well, I'm still trying to
get rid of the last thing I saved.

211
00:19:41.513 --> 00:19:43.307
But you can't leave him here.

212
00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:44.892
(baby cooing)

213
00:19:47.936 --> 00:19:51.190
Look, there's smoke.
That's his herd right up the hill.

214
00:19:51.732 --> 00:19:54.401
-We should return him.
-Let's get something straight here, okay?

215
00:19:54.484 --> 00:19:57.654
There is no "we."
There never was a "we."

216
00:19:57.738 --> 00:20:00.616
In fact, without me,
there wouldn't even be a "you."

217
00:20:02.284 --> 00:20:03.619
Just up the hill.

218
00:20:03.702 --> 00:20:08.999
Listen very carefully.
I'm not going.

219
00:20:09.416 --> 00:20:12.502
Fine. Be a jerk.
I'll take care of him.

220
00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:15.130
Oh, yeah, that's good.
You'll take care of him.

221
00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:17.799
You can't even take care of yourself.
This I gotta see.

222
00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:19.092
I'll return you.

223
00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:21.887
We don't need that
meany-weeny mammoth, do we?

224
00:20:22.346 --> 00:20:23.388
No, we don't.

225
00:20:41.865 --> 00:20:45.535
(straining)

226
00:20:53.752 --> 00:20:56.129
You're an embarrassment to nature.
Do you know that?

227
00:20:57.839 --> 00:21:02.344
This is cake!
I'm fine! I'm fine! I'm gonna die.

228
00:21:09.601 --> 00:21:10.727
(baby cooing)

229
00:21:14.398 --> 00:21:16.608
(baby laughing)

230
00:21:16.692 --> 00:21:17.526
Manny!

231
00:21:19.653 --> 00:21:20.487
(baby laughs)

232
00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:21.655
(growls)

233
00:21:26.827 --> 00:21:29.621
(roars)

234
00:21:30.872 --> 00:21:33.375
(clears throat)
Um, that pink thing is mine.

235
00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:35.502
Uh, no, actually,
that pink thing belongs to us.

236
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:42.384
Us? You two are
a bit of an odd couple.

237
00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:44.177
There is no us!

238
00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:47.180
I see. Can't have one of your own,
so you want to adopt.

239
00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:50.726
Look, I'm sorry to interrupt your snack,
but we got to go.

240
00:21:51.059 --> 00:21:54.563
The baby? Please.
I was returning him to his herd.

241
00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:57.983
-Oh, yeah. Nice try, bucktooth.
-You calling me a liar?

242
00:21:58.066 --> 00:22:00.485
-I didn't say that.
-You were thinking it.

243
00:22:01.111 --> 00:22:05.741
-I don't like this cat. He reads minds.
-Name's Diego, friend.

244
00:22:06.074 --> 00:22:07.826
Manfred. And I'm not your friend.

245
00:22:08.243 --> 00:22:10.495
Fine, Manfred.

246
00:22:11.788 --> 00:22:13.915
If you're looking for the humans,
you're wasting your time.

247
00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:17.669
-They left this morning.
-Thanks for the advice. Now beat it.

248
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:20.380
All right, I'll help you
bring it to its herd.

249
00:22:20.464 --> 00:22:22.758
But promise me that you'll
leave me alone after that.

250
00:22:22.841 --> 00:22:24.468
Okay. Okay, deal.

251
00:22:24.551 --> 00:22:26.219
-Hey, what's your problem?
-You are my problem.

252
00:22:26.303 --> 00:22:28.555
Well, I think you're stressed,
and that's why you eat so much.

253
00:22:28.638 --> 00:22:30.682
I mean, It's hard to get fat
on a vegan diet.

254
00:22:30.766 --> 00:22:31.850
I'm not fat.

255
00:22:31.933 --> 00:22:33.060
It's all this fur.

256
00:22:33.143 --> 00:22:35.645
-It makes me look poofy.
-All right.

257
00:22:35.729 --> 00:22:38.357
You have fat hair,
but when you're ready to talk, I'm here.

258
00:22:42.152 --> 00:22:43.779
MANFRED: What are you doing?
Just drop it on the ledge.

259
00:22:45.572 --> 00:22:47.449
SID: Shouldn't we make sure
they found him?

260
00:22:47.532 --> 00:22:49.868
-Good idea.
-Oh, no, no. No, no, wait, wait, wait!

261
00:22:49.951 --> 00:22:51.328
(screams)

262
00:22:51.411 --> 00:22:53.455
Don't spear me!

263
00:22:56.291 --> 00:22:58.085
Oh, this is a problem.

264
00:22:58.627 --> 00:23:02.297
Now what? Oh, that's perfect.

265
00:23:04.508 --> 00:23:06.259
(baby cooing)

266
00:23:08.261 --> 00:23:09.471
-(baby laughing)
-Hey, hey, hey.

267
00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:24.027
(baby cooing)

268
00:23:31.326 --> 00:23:32.536
(baby laughing)

269
00:23:33.537 --> 00:23:36.081
-I told you they were gone.
-Well, look who it is.

270
00:23:36.164 --> 00:23:38.667
Don't you have some poor,
defenseless animal to disembowel?

271
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:39.751
Oh, they couldn't be far.

272
00:23:39.835 --> 00:23:42.629
I mean, they went this way
or this way or maybe...

273
00:23:42.712 --> 00:23:45.215
You don't know much
about tracking, do you?

274
00:23:45.298 --> 00:23:48.635
Hey, I'm a sloth. I see a tree,
eat a leaf. That's my tracking.

275
00:23:49.302 --> 00:23:50.762
You didn't miss them by much.

276
00:23:51.555 --> 00:23:54.850
It's still green.
They headed north two hours ago.

277
00:23:55.225 --> 00:23:57.185
"Hey, it's still green.
They headed north two hours ago."

278
00:24:00.939 --> 00:24:01.773
(laughing)

279
00:24:01.857 --> 00:24:03.108
You don't need this aggravation.

280
00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.903
Give me the baby.

281
00:24:06.987 --> 00:24:09.364
I can track humans down
a lot faster than you can.

282
00:24:09.448 --> 00:24:12.117
And you're just a good citizen
helping out, right?

283
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.244
I just know where
the humans are going.

284
00:24:14.327 --> 00:24:18.165
Glacier Pass. Everybody knows they have
a settlement on the other side.

285
00:24:20.375 --> 00:24:22.252
Well, unless
you know how to track,

286
00:24:22.335 --> 00:24:25.046
you're never gonna reach them
before the pass closes up with snow,

287
00:24:25.505 --> 00:24:27.966
which should be, like, tomorrow.

288
00:24:28.592 --> 00:24:32.637
So you can give that baby to me
or go get lost in a blizzard.

289
00:24:32.721 --> 00:24:33.972
It's your choice.

290
00:24:41.104 --> 00:24:42.772
Here's your little bundle of joy.

291
00:24:42.856 --> 00:24:44.357
We're returning it to the humans.

292
00:24:45.192 --> 00:24:50.906
Aw, the big, bad tigey-wigey
gets left behind. Poor tigey-wigey.

293
00:24:50.989 --> 00:24:53.825
Sid, tigey-wigey's
gonna lead the way.

294
00:24:56.661 --> 00:25:00.290
Uh, uh, Manny, can I...
can I talk to you for a second?

295
00:25:00.373 --> 00:25:02.375
No. The sooner we find the humans,

296
00:25:02.459 --> 00:25:06.463
the sooner I get rid of Mr. Stinky
Droolface and the baby too.

297
00:25:08.715 --> 00:25:11.510
You won't always have Jumbo
around to protect you.

298
00:25:11.593 --> 00:25:15.096
And when that day comes,
I suggest you watch your back,

299
00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:16.723
'cause I'll be chewing on it.

300
00:25:17.182 --> 00:25:20.227
Hey,<i> Uber </i>tracker,
up front where I can see you!

301
00:25:21.186 --> 00:25:22.354
Help me.

302
00:25:31.071 --> 00:25:37.994
(baby crying)

303
00:25:38.078 --> 00:25:42.123
Oh, you got to make it stop.
I can't take it anymore!

304
00:25:42.207 --> 00:25:44.209
I've eaten things that
didn't complain as much!

305
00:25:44.292 --> 00:25:46.503
-He won't stop squirming.
-You're holding it wrong!

306
00:25:46.586 --> 00:25:48.547
-Watch its head!
-Just put it down!

307
00:25:49.005 --> 00:25:51.174
Jeez, pick him up, put him down.
(gibberish)

308
00:25:51.633 --> 00:25:54.719
-Its nose is dry.
-That means something's wrong with it.

309
00:25:55.053 --> 00:25:56.888
Someone should lick it.
Just in case.

310
00:25:56.972 --> 00:25:57.806
I'll do it.

311
00:25:57.889 --> 00:26:00.058
Hey, he's wearing one
of those baby thingies.

312
00:26:00.141 --> 00:26:02.477
-So?
-So if he poops, where does it go?

313
00:26:04.813 --> 00:26:07.065
-(crying)
-Humans are disgusting.

314
00:26:07.399 --> 00:26:11.152
-Okay, you, check for poop.
-Hey, why am I the poop checker?

315
00:26:11.236 --> 00:26:14.239
Because returning the runt was your idea.
Because you're small and insignificant.

316
00:26:14.322 --> 00:26:15.991
And because
I'll pummel you if you don't.

317
00:26:16.783 --> 00:26:18.952
-Why else?
-Now, Sid!

318
00:26:20.954 --> 00:26:24.291
-(crying continues)
-Eww! Yuck!

319
00:26:24.374 --> 00:26:27.127
Eww! I mean, my goodness.

320
00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:28.587
All right, look out, look out.
Coming through.

321
00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:29.504
Hey, watch out!

322
00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:32.716
-Stop waving that thing around!
-Ooh, ooh, I'm gonna slip.

323
00:26:38.221 --> 00:26:39.556
SID: It's clean!

324
00:26:39.639 --> 00:26:42.183
-Got ya! (laughs)
-(crying)

325
00:26:42.684 --> 00:26:44.477
-Will you cut it out?
-(chuckles)

326
00:26:44.936 --> 00:26:46.104
(crying)

327
00:26:46.521 --> 00:26:48.356
Hey, do that again.
He likes it.

328
00:26:49.649 --> 00:26:50.525
(snickers)

329
00:26:51.568 --> 00:26:53.028
It's making me feel better, too.

330
00:26:53.528 --> 00:26:55.947
-(crying)
-Here, you hold it.

331
00:26:57.073 --> 00:26:58.491
(chuckles)

332
00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:01.828
(giggles)

333
00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:05.206
-(crying)
-Here, turn him towards me!

334
00:27:05.665 --> 00:27:09.753
Where's the baby?
There he is!

335
00:27:11.254 --> 00:27:15.717
Where's the baby?
There he is!

336
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.594
(crying)

337
00:27:17.969 --> 00:27:19.471
Stop it!
You're scaring him!

338
00:27:21.556 --> 00:27:23.767
(stomach growling)

339
00:27:24.476 --> 00:27:25.727
I bet he's hungry.

340
00:27:26.269 --> 00:27:28.021
-How 'bout some milk?
-Ooh, I'd love some!

341
00:27:28.104 --> 00:27:29.898
Not you! The baby!

342
00:27:29.981 --> 00:27:32.692
Well, I ain't exactly
lactating right now, pal.

343
00:27:32.776 --> 00:27:35.111
You're a little low on the food chain
to be mouthing off, aren't...

344
00:27:35.195 --> 00:27:38.865
Enough!
(echoing)

345
00:27:39.574 --> 00:27:40.408
(object drops)

346
00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:42.494
-Food!
-Food!

347
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:44.954
(squawking)

348
00:27:51.878 --> 00:27:55.840
<i>♪ I don't know</i>
<i>but I've been told ♪</i>

349
00:27:56.174 --> 00:28:00.053
<i>♪ End of the world</i>
<i>be mighty cold ♪</i>

350
00:28:00.679 --> 00:28:03.139
Prepare for the Ice Age!

351
00:28:03.223 --> 00:28:05.684
Protect the dodo way of life!

352
00:28:05.767 --> 00:28:09.312
Survival separates the dodo
from the beast!

353
00:28:11.147 --> 00:28:13.817
<i>Protect the dodo way of life!</i>

354
00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:17.070
<i>-Prepare for the Ice Age!</i>
-Ice Age?

355
00:28:17.404 --> 00:28:18.863
I've heard of these crackpots.

356
00:28:21.658 --> 00:28:23.118
(squawks)
Intruders!

357
00:28:23.201 --> 00:28:26.538
Now don't fall in.
If you do, you will definitely...

358
00:28:26.621 --> 00:28:28.665
Intruders! Intru...
(squawks)

359
00:28:29.332 --> 00:28:30.166
Eww.

360
00:28:30.625 --> 00:28:31.710
Burn and die.

361
00:28:33.628 --> 00:28:35.130
Hey, can we have
our melon back?

362
00:28:35.463 --> 00:28:37.716
-Junior's hungry and, uh...
-No way!

363
00:28:37.799 --> 00:28:40.218
This is our private stockpile
for the Ice Age.

364
00:28:40.301 --> 00:28:43.888
Subarctic temperatures will force us
underground for a million billion years.

365
00:28:44.264 --> 00:28:45.473
So you got three melons?

366
00:28:48.059 --> 00:28:52.063
If you weren't smart enough to plan ahead,
then doom on you.

367
00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:55.275
Doom on you.
Doom on you.

368
00:28:55.775 --> 00:28:56.818
Get away from me.

369
00:28:56.901 --> 00:28:59.988
-Doom on you.
-Oh, no! No!

370
00:29:01.489 --> 00:29:05.326
Retrieve the melon!
Tae kwon dodos, attack!

371
00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:07.328
(Karate yelling)

372
00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.047
The melon!

373
00:29:18.131 --> 00:29:21.050
The melon! The melon!
The melon! The melon!

374
00:29:22.177 --> 00:29:23.928
There goes our last female.

375
00:29:31.603 --> 00:29:35.440
Got it, got it, got it, got it...
Don't got it.

376
00:29:36.608 --> 00:29:38.902
The last melon!

377
00:29:40.403 --> 00:29:41.988
(gobbling)

378
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:53.124
(yells)

379
00:29:54.042 --> 00:29:55.710
(yelling)

380
00:30:24.155 --> 00:30:25.240
(squeals)

381
00:31:05.071 --> 00:31:06.489
Aw, Sid!

382
00:31:07.198 --> 00:31:08.783
Now we gotta find more food!

383
00:31:13.371 --> 00:31:16.165
Right. More to the right.
More to the right!

384
00:31:16.249 --> 00:31:17.667
Hey, look at that.
Dinner and a show.

385
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:22.338
Left, left, left!
(screaming)

386
00:31:25.884 --> 00:31:29.637
Now to find a meal
befitting a conquering hero.

387
00:31:32.473 --> 00:31:35.894
What ho? A foe? Come on! Come on.
You want a piece of me?

388
00:31:35.977 --> 00:31:37.645
(Karate yell)

389
00:31:39.272 --> 00:31:41.983
Spoils worthy of such a noble...

390
00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:51.826
Bedtime, squirt.

391
00:32:02.045 --> 00:32:03.922
Oh, the triumphant return.

392
00:32:04.422 --> 00:32:05.715
Huh? Oh, that.

393
00:32:08.468 --> 00:32:09.427
I'm so full.

394
00:32:10.386 --> 00:32:12.805
How 'bout a good-night kiss
for your big buddy Sid?

395
00:32:12.889 --> 00:32:16.476
-Shh. He's asleep.
-I was talking to you.

396
00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:19.187
Fine. I'll tuck myself in.

397
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:22.148
(yawns)

398
00:32:25.985 --> 00:32:28.696
All right. Good night.

399
00:32:37.747 --> 00:32:39.374
SID: (yawning)

400
00:32:41.668 --> 00:32:44.379
(mumbling)

401
00:32:48.132 --> 00:32:49.050
(yells)

402
00:32:50.677 --> 00:32:53.054
-Ahh!
-Will you stop it!

403
00:32:54.097 --> 00:32:56.391
All right, all right.
Just trying to relax.

404
00:33:00.561 --> 00:33:01.729
(sucking)

405
00:33:02.647 --> 00:33:04.691
-MANFRED: Oy.
-SID: (snoring)

406
00:33:06.317 --> 00:33:08.277
(snoring)

407
00:33:47.316 --> 00:33:48.860
(rustling)

408
00:33:52.572 --> 00:33:53.406
What the...

409
00:33:53.489 --> 00:33:56.034
Go ahead, slice me.
It'll be the last thing you ever do.

410
00:33:56.117 --> 00:33:59.412
-I'm working here, you waste of fur.
-Frustrated, Diego?

411
00:33:59.954 --> 00:34:02.540
Tracking down helpless infants
too difficult for you?

412
00:34:03.041 --> 00:34:04.667
What are you two doing here?

413
00:34:05.126 --> 00:34:07.295
Soto's getting tired of waiting.

414
00:34:07.378 --> 00:34:10.423
Yeah, yeah.
He said come back with the baby...

415
00:34:10.798 --> 00:34:13.342
or don't come back at all!
(laughs)

416
00:34:14.177 --> 00:34:16.095
Well, I have a message for Soto.

417
00:34:16.512 --> 00:34:18.806
Tell him I'm bringing the baby.

418
00:34:20.266 --> 00:34:24.103
And tell him I'm bringing...
a mammoth.

419
00:34:25.271 --> 00:34:27.774
-A mammoth?
-Mammoths never travel alone.

420
00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:31.903
Well, this one does,
and I'm leading him to Half Peak.

421
00:34:31.986 --> 00:34:33.029
Mmm.

422
00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.741
-Look at all that meat. Let's get him!
-Not yet!

423
00:34:37.825 --> 00:34:39.994
We'll need the whole pack
to bring this mammoth down.

424
00:34:40.328 --> 00:34:41.496
Get everyone ready.

425
00:34:43.081 --> 00:34:43.915
Now!

426
00:35:08.356 --> 00:35:11.150
-Where's the baby?
-You lost it?

427
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:14.112
-Sid!
-Sid!

428
00:35:15.029 --> 00:35:18.908
Ooh, it's so ugly.
It's positively adorable.

429
00:35:18.991 --> 00:35:22.703
Hello, pumpkin.
Hello, little baldy bean.

430
00:35:23.079 --> 00:35:26.749
-Where'd you find it?
-Ah, the poor kid. All alone in the wild.

431
00:35:27.166 --> 00:35:30.628
Sabers were closing in on him,
so I just snatched him.

432
00:35:30.711 --> 00:35:32.505
Oh, so brave.

433
00:35:32.588 --> 00:35:37.176
Yeah, well, he needed me,
and I only wish I had one of my own too.

434
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:42.390
-Really? I find that attractive in a male.
-Oh, alas.

435
00:35:42.473 --> 00:35:44.809
Who wouldn't want a family,
I always say.

436
00:35:45.852 --> 00:35:49.355
-Where have you been hiding?
-Yeah, well, you know.

437
00:35:51.399 --> 00:35:53.025
(laughs)

438
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:56.946
Cute kid, huh? So, so as I was
saying, ladies, uh...

439
00:35:57.905 --> 00:35:59.740
(gasps)
Oh, hey!

440
00:36:00.199 --> 00:36:03.077
-Hi, Manny.
-What's the matter with you?

441
00:36:04.745 --> 00:36:08.875
Excuse me, ladies. You just keep
marinating, and I'll be right back.

442
00:36:11.127 --> 00:36:12.378
Sexy.

443
00:36:14.046 --> 00:36:17.550
Oh, he's not much to look at,
but it's so hard to find a family guy.

444
00:36:17.633 --> 00:36:20.720
Tell me about it.
All the sensitive ones get eaten.

445
00:36:21.554 --> 00:36:23.472
No, no, no, no!
M-M-Manny, please.

446
00:36:23.556 --> 00:36:25.057
I'm begging you.
I need him.

447
00:36:25.391 --> 00:36:27.393
What, a good-looking guy
like you?

448
00:36:27.476 --> 00:36:30.938
-Aw, you say that, but you don't mean it.
-No, seriously, look at you.

449
00:36:31.022 --> 00:36:33.524
SID: Aw, those ladies,
they don't stand a chance.

450
00:36:33.608 --> 00:36:35.443
You have a very cruel
sense of humor.

451
00:36:35.526 --> 00:36:36.903
Hey, don't let me cramp your style.

452
00:36:36.986 --> 00:36:39.030
Oh, thanks, Manny.
You're a pal. You're the best.

453
00:36:39.113 --> 00:36:42.742
-Without Pinky.
-No, M-M-Manny, I need him.

454
00:36:42.825 --> 00:36:45.995
(humming)

455
00:36:46.078 --> 00:36:48.956
So, ladies, where were we?

456
00:36:49.457 --> 00:36:52.001
-Carl?
-Easy, Frank.

457
00:36:52.084 --> 00:36:54.045
-(growling)
-(screaming)

458
00:36:55.004 --> 00:36:57.506
Pretty tail walks by,
and suddenly he moves like a cheetah.

459
00:36:58.216 --> 00:37:02.553
And that tiger. Yeah, Mr. Great Tracker.
Can't even find a sloth.

460
00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:04.639
What am I?
Their wet nurse?

461
00:37:05.556 --> 00:37:07.433
What are you looking at, bone bag?

462
00:37:07.516 --> 00:37:08.392
(giggling)

463
00:37:09.352 --> 00:37:12.104
Look at you. You're gonna grow
into a great predator.

464
00:37:13.481 --> 00:37:14.440
I don't think so.

465
00:37:14.815 --> 00:37:19.820
What do you got? You got a little
patch of fur, no fangs, no claws.

466
00:37:20.655 --> 00:37:23.616
You're folds of skin,
wrapped in... mush.

467
00:37:24.408 --> 00:37:25.993
What's so threatening
about you?

468
00:37:31.832 --> 00:37:34.085
Hey, does this look like
a petting zoo to you, huh?

469
00:37:35.169 --> 00:37:36.045
(screams)

470
00:37:36.128 --> 00:37:37.004
(laughing)

471
00:37:38.047 --> 00:37:41.092
Okay. All right, wise guy.
You just earned a time-out.

472
00:37:44.553 --> 00:37:46.931
Oh, you think that's funny?
How 'bout this?

473
00:37:49.725 --> 00:37:51.352
You'll be a little snack
for the owls.

474
00:37:54.438 --> 00:37:56.232
You're a brave little squirt.
I'll give you that.

475
00:38:01.862 --> 00:38:05.324
Whoa! Oh, thank goodness.
Thank goodness.

476
00:38:05.408 --> 00:38:10.788
Oh, no! A tiger!
Help! Help!

477
00:38:10.871 --> 00:38:13.207
-Where's the baby?
-Oh, he's fine. Manfred has him.

478
00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:16.377
Just put me in your mouth.
Come on. Hurry up. Ohh!

479
00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:19.463
He got me! Oh, help.

480
00:38:19.547 --> 00:38:20.673
-(hoofbeats)
-Get away from me.

481
00:38:21.215 --> 00:38:23.301
He went this way.
Over here.

482
00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:27.013
(snarls)

483
00:38:32.351 --> 00:38:35.146
No! Carl, the tiger
beat us to him.

484
00:38:36.856 --> 00:38:37.982
Wait a minute.

485
00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:43.070
(sniffs, grunts)

486
00:38:44.405 --> 00:38:45.614
He's dead, all right.

487
00:38:45.948 --> 00:38:48.576
Ohh! Carnivores
have all the fun.

488
00:38:50.369 --> 00:38:53.539
Oh, gosh. I hate breaking
their hearts like that.

489
00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.833
Ah, but you know how it is.

490
00:38:57.043 --> 00:38:58.711
All right, thanks.
Uh, you can put me down now.

491
00:39:00.463 --> 00:39:02.465
M-Manny! Manny!

492
00:39:03.049 --> 00:39:04.842
Guys, I thought
we were in a hurry.

493
00:39:04.925 --> 00:39:07.970
Oh, and Diego, spit that out.
You don't know where it's been.

494
00:39:10.139 --> 00:39:11.932
Boy, for a second there,

495
00:39:12.016 --> 00:39:15.394
-I actually thought you were gonna eat me.
-I don't eat junk food.

496
00:39:15.478 --> 00:39:18.230
(laughs) I thought you were gonna...
I thought you were gonna...

497
00:39:18.773 --> 00:39:19.607
Were you?

498
00:39:22.443 --> 00:39:25.237
Come on, wait up. Wait up!
Come on, come on, fellas.

499
00:39:25.321 --> 00:39:28.366
-Can you wait a second, please?
Hey, fellas!
<i>-♪ On my way ♪</i>

500
00:39:28.699 --> 00:39:32.370

00:39:38.584 --> 00:39:42.129

-Don't make me reach back there!
-Yeah, well, he started it!

508
00:39:57.812 --> 00:39:59.772
I don't care who started it!
I'll finish it!

Hiya, Diego.

524
00:41:04.211 --> 00:41:05.129
Hey, Sid.

525
00:41:06.714 --> 00:41:08.674
-You're lost, aren't you?
-No.

526
00:41:08.757 --> 00:41:11.886
-I know exactly where we are.
-Ask him directions.

527
00:41:12.928 --> 00:41:15.473
-I don't need directions.
-Fine. I'll ask him.

528
00:41:15.848 --> 00:41:18.309
Hey, buddy,
you see any humans go by here?

529
00:41:20.978 --> 00:41:24.023
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love this game.
I love this game. Okay, okay.

530
00:41:25.107 --> 00:41:28.110
SID: Three words.
First word. Uh, stomp.

531
00:41:28.194 --> 00:41:31.947
-SID: No, no. Stamp, stamp.
-MANFRED: Let me try. Uh,pack!

532
00:41:32.031 --> 00:41:35.993
Good one, Manny.
Pack of... Long teeth and claws.

533
00:41:37.661 --> 00:41:40.956
-Pack of wolves? Pack of...
-Pack of bears?

534
00:41:41.624 --> 00:41:44.960
-MANFRED: Pack of fleas?
-SID: Pack of whiskers? Pack of noses?

535
00:41:45.044 --> 00:41:47.254

-Pack of lies.

543
00:42:40.975 --> 00:42:44.228
Hey! Great news.
I found a shortcut!

544
00:42:47.273 --> 00:42:48.399
What do you mean, shortcut?

545
00:42:48.482 --> 00:42:50.985
I mean faster than
the long way around.

546
00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:54.238
-Ow! I know what a shortcut is!
-Look.

547
00:42:54.321 --> 00:42:57.074
Either we slip through there
and beat the humans to Glacier Pass,

548
00:42:57.157 --> 00:42:58.867
or we take the long way
and miss 'em.

549
00:42:59.285 --> 00:43:02.204
Through there?
What do you take me for?

550
00:43:02.871 --> 00:43:06.166
This time tomorrow,
you could be a free mammoth.

551
00:43:06.667 --> 00:43:09.503
DIEGO: Or a nanny. Personally,
I never get tired of peekaboo.

552
00:43:09.587 --> 00:43:11.380
Hey, guys. Hey, guys.
Check this out.

553
00:43:11.463 --> 00:43:15.926
-(groaning)
-Sid, the tiger found a shortcut.

554
00:43:19.638 --> 00:43:21.348
No, thanks. I choose life.

555
00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:24.143
Then I suggest
you take the shortcut.

556
00:43:24.643 --> 00:43:27.396
-Are you threatening me?
-Move, sloth!

557
00:43:27.479 --> 00:43:29.064
(echoing)

558
00:43:30.024 --> 00:43:33.152
(rumbling)

559
00:43:33.235 --> 00:43:34.403
Way to go, tiger.

560
00:43:35.821 --> 00:43:37.156
Quick! Inside!

561
00:44:01.305 --> 00:44:03.265
Okay, I vote shortcut.

562
00:44:18.322 --> 00:44:21.659
Come on, guys. Stick together.
It's easy to get lost in here.

563
00:44:36.757 --> 00:44:38.425
Uh, guys?

564
00:44:54.316 --> 00:44:55.192
(yelps)

565
00:44:56.276 --> 00:44:57.861
(chuckles)
A fish.

566
00:45:01.657 --> 00:45:02.991
(screams)

567
00:45:39.528 --> 00:45:42.990
-Bah.
-Will you keep up, please?

568
00:45:43.073 --> 00:45:45.409
Hard enough to keep track
of one baby.

569
00:45:51.832 --> 00:45:54.668
(screams)

570
00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:30.788
(laughing)

571
00:46:30.871 --> 00:46:32.164
I gotcha!

572
00:46:46.345 --> 00:46:48.138
Oww!

573
00:46:49.473 --> 00:46:51.767
-Captain, iceberg ahead!
-(screaming)

574
00:46:54.311 --> 00:46:55.437
(sighs)

575
00:46:58.357 --> 00:47:00.692
-Oh, no.
-(screaming)

576
00:47:05.447 --> 00:47:07.199
(baby laughing)

577
00:47:46.113 --> 00:47:48.448
(baby laughing)

578
00:47:49.867 --> 00:47:52.578
Wow! Whoo! Yeah!

579
00:47:52.661 --> 00:47:53.996
Who's up for round two?

580
00:47:55.998 --> 00:47:57.749
Oh.
(clears throat)

581
00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:00.377
T-T-Tell the kid
to be more careful.

582
00:48:03.338 --> 00:48:08.760
(sniffing)
Ah!

583
00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:43.462
Look, look! Tigers!

584
00:48:44.922 --> 00:48:45.839
-Yeech!
-(baby whimpering)

585
00:48:46.882 --> 00:48:48.050
No, it's okay, it's okay.

586
00:48:48.133 --> 00:48:51.386
Look, the tigers
are just playing tag with the antelope...

587
00:48:53.639 --> 00:48:54.681
with their teeth.

588
00:48:55.515 --> 00:48:57.851
Come on, Sid.
Let's play tag.

589
00:48:58.268 --> 00:49:01.897
-You're it.
-(chuckles) Sure.

590
00:49:02.606 --> 00:49:04.358
Okay, okay, okay,
where are the sloths?

591
00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:06.526
You know, you never see
any sloths in these things.

592
00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:09.363
Have you ever noticed?
Oh, look, Manny. A mammoth.

593
00:49:09.446 --> 00:49:11.365
Ooh. Somebody pinch me.

594
00:49:11.448 --> 00:49:15.243
Hey, hey, this fat one
looks just like you. Aww!

595
00:49:15.744 --> 00:49:18.872
SID: And he's got a family.
Oh, and he's happy.

596
00:49:19.665 --> 00:49:23.168
Look, he's playing with his kid.
See, Manny, that's your problem.

597
00:49:23.251 --> 00:49:25.754
-That's what mammoths are supposed to do.
-Sid.

598
00:49:25.837 --> 00:49:28.090
Find a she-moth, have
little baby mammoths and, and...

599
00:49:28.173 --> 00:49:29.049
Sid!

600
00:49:29.132 --> 00:49:30.634
-What? But...
-Shut up.

601
00:49:32.928 --> 00:49:37.432
Oh.

602
00:49:51.321 --> 00:49:52.280
(trumpets)

603
00:49:59.204 --> 00:50:00.831
(trumpeting)

604
00:50:24.354 --> 00:50:26.648
(trumpeting)

605
00:51:49.189 --> 00:51:52.234
(whining, sniffing)

606
00:52:02.202 --> 00:52:06.706
(whining, sniffing)

607
00:52:59.384 --> 00:53:01.511
MANFRED:
Well, would you look at that.

608
00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:04.848
The tiger actually did it.
There's Half Peak.

609
00:53:04.931 --> 00:53:07.392
Next stop, Glacier Pass.

610
00:53:07.976 --> 00:53:09.769
How could I ever
have doubted you.

611
00:53:09.853 --> 00:53:13.106
Did you hear that, little fella?
You're almost home.

612
00:53:14.107 --> 00:53:15.483
(baby coos)

613
00:53:18.612 --> 00:53:19.487
My feet are sweating.

614
00:53:19.571 --> 00:53:21.573
Do we have to get
a news flash every time...

615
00:53:21.656 --> 00:53:22.949
your body does something?

616
00:53:23.033 --> 00:53:24.534
He's doing it for attention.
Just ignore him.

617
00:53:24.618 --> 00:53:28.246
Seriously.
My feet are really hot. Ow. Ow.

618
00:53:28.747 --> 00:53:31.124
-Ow. Ow.
-(rumbling)

619
00:53:33.668 --> 00:53:35.921
-Tell me that was your stomach.
-Shh!

620
00:53:36.004 --> 00:53:38.089
I'm sure it was just thunder.

621
00:53:38.632 --> 00:53:41.301
From underground?

622
00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:45.138
Run!

623
00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:05.158
-Come on, keep up with me.
-I would if you were moving!

624
00:54:09.246 --> 00:54:11.539
-Wow. I wish I could jump like that.
-Wish granted.

625
00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:13.792
(screams)

626
00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:17.963
Come on! Move faster!

627
00:54:18.046 --> 00:54:20.507
Have you noticed the river of lava?

628
00:54:40.193 --> 00:54:41.152
Hold Pinky!

629
00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:08.096
Whoa!

630
00:55:13.226 --> 00:55:14.477
-Manny!
-(trumpets)

631
00:55:27.657 --> 00:55:29.159
Manny, Manny,
Manny, you okay?

632
00:55:29.242 --> 00:55:31.703
Come on, come on.
Say something. Anything!

633
00:55:32.329 --> 00:55:34.497
(mumbles)

634
00:55:34.581 --> 00:55:36.624
What? What?
I can't hear you.

635
00:55:36.708 --> 00:55:39.002
-You're standing on my trunk.
-Oh.

636
00:55:39.085 --> 00:55:40.462
(gasps)

637
00:55:41.087 --> 00:55:43.757
-Oh, you're okay! You're okay!
-Why did you do that?

638
00:55:44.674 --> 00:55:46.926
You could have died
trying to save me.

639
00:55:47.761 --> 00:55:49.054
That's what you do in a herd.

640
00:55:50.513 --> 00:55:51.681
You look out for each other.

641
00:55:52.599 --> 00:55:54.976
Well, thanks.

642
00:55:57.270 --> 00:56:00.815
I don't know about you guys, but we are
the weirdest herd I've ever seen.

643
00:56:18.249 --> 00:56:20.168
(laughing)

644
00:56:20.251 --> 00:56:22.879
I can't wait to get my claws
in that mammoth!

645
00:56:23.421 --> 00:56:26.883
No one touches the mammoth
until I get that baby.

646
00:56:29.969 --> 00:56:33.181
First, I'm gonna slice
its hindquarters into sections.

647
00:56:33.264 --> 00:56:35.642
I'm gonna put the white meat
in one pile and the dark in another.

648
00:56:35.725 --> 00:56:38.436
-Hey, knock it off! I'm starving!
-Next, the shoulders.

649
00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:41.398
Occasionally tough,
but extremely juicy.

650
00:56:41.481 --> 00:56:43.149
I told you to knock it off!

651
00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:46.736
Save your energy!
Mammoths don't go down easy.

652
00:56:47.987 --> 00:56:50.281
There's only one way to do it.

653
00:56:50.365 --> 00:56:52.659
First you have
to force it into a corner.

654
00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:57.372
Cut off its retreat.
And when you three have it trapped,

655
00:56:57.789 --> 00:56:59.290
I'll go for the throat.

656
00:56:59.958 --> 00:57:00.792
(gulps)

657
00:57:09.926 --> 00:57:12.137
Guys, we gotta get this kid
out of the wind.

658
00:57:16.933 --> 00:57:19.060
-How much further?
-Three miles.

659
00:57:19.144 --> 00:57:20.186
I'm beat.

660
00:57:21.187 --> 00:57:22.564
We'll get there in the morning.

661
00:57:25.817 --> 00:57:26.651
What are you doing?

662
00:57:26.985 --> 00:57:29.195
I'm putting sloths on the map.

663
00:57:32.407 --> 00:57:35.160
Yeah, why don't you make it realistic
and draw him lying down?

664
00:57:35.618 --> 00:57:37.078
And make him rounder.

665
00:57:40.206 --> 00:57:41.040
DIEGO:
Perfect.

666
00:57:41.124 --> 00:57:43.835
Ha ha.
I forgot how to laugh.

667
00:57:51.509 --> 00:57:52.969
I'm a genius!

668
00:57:57.307 --> 00:58:02.061
From now on, you'll have to refer to me
as Sid, Lord of the Flame.

669
00:58:02.145 --> 00:58:05.607
Hey, Lord of the Flame,
your tail's on fire.

670
00:58:06.816 --> 00:58:10.320
-(screaming)
-(baby laughing)

671
00:58:12.322 --> 00:58:13.156
Ahh!

672
00:58:13.948 --> 00:58:17.660
Thank you. From now on,
I'm gonna call you Diego.

673
00:58:17.744 --> 00:58:19.454
Lord of Touch Me and You're Dead.

674
00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:23.124
I'm just kidding,
you little knucklehead.

675
00:58:23.666 --> 00:58:24.834
MANFRED: Hey, lovebirds.

676
00:58:26.252 --> 00:58:27.086
Look at this.

677
00:58:32.091 --> 00:58:34.052
I don't believe it.

678
00:58:47.732 --> 00:58:51.486
Come here, you little biped.
Come here, you little wormy worm.

679
00:58:52.862 --> 00:58:55.823
Come to Uncle Sid.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

680
00:58:56.199 --> 00:58:58.034
This way. This way.

681
00:58:59.244 --> 00:59:00.787
No, no, no, no.
Go to him.

682
00:59:03.122 --> 00:59:03.957
Go to him.

683
00:59:06.376 --> 00:59:09.712
-Um, okay.
-(coos)

684
00:59:10.255 --> 00:59:13.800
Good job.
Uh, keep practicing.

685
00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:20.598
Look at that.
Our little guy's growing up. (sneezes)

686
00:59:22.559 --> 00:59:23.476
All right, come on.

687
00:59:24.227 --> 00:59:25.520
Sleep time, Lumpy.

688
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:32.527
Look at that big pushover.

689
00:59:34.862 --> 00:59:38.825
You know what, Diego, I've never had
a friend who would risk his life for me.

690
00:59:39.450 --> 00:59:43.621
Yeah. Manny's...
He's a good guy.

691
00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:45.081
Yeah, he is.

692
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.210
Well, good night.

693
01:00:18.906 --> 01:00:20.908
-(pop)
-Ohh!

694
01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:23.411
SID: All right, let's get you
all cleaned up.

695
01:00:23.494 --> 01:00:26.414
I mean, what's your daddy gonna say if you
go back all schmutzy and stinky like this?

696
01:00:27.206 --> 01:00:29.709
(slurps)
Let me just clean that up.

697
01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:32.128
That looks good.
A little bit here.

698
01:00:32.211 --> 01:00:33.838
You clean up nice, little fella.

699
01:00:34.255 --> 01:00:37.133
I think he's starting to look like me.
Hey, Diego, what do you think?

700
01:00:39.927 --> 01:00:42.138
-Maybe we shouldn't do this.
-Why not?

701
01:00:42.221 --> 01:00:45.933
Because if we save him, he'll grow up to
be a hunter. Who do you think he'll hunt?

702
01:00:46.351 --> 01:00:48.645
Maybe because we save him,
he won't hunt us. Ow!

703
01:00:48.728 --> 01:00:51.314
Yeah, and maybe he'll grow fur
and a long, skinny neck...

704
01:00:51.397 --> 01:00:52.565
DIEGO: and call you Mama!

705
01:00:53.941 --> 01:00:54.942
What's your problem?

706
01:00:56.194 --> 01:00:58.655
Nothing. Let's go.
I'm freezing my tail off.

707
01:01:18.466 --> 01:01:20.635
Hey, Diego!
You frozen back there?

708
01:01:25.098 --> 01:01:26.057
Get down!

709
01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:27.225
-What?
-Shh!

710
01:01:27.308 --> 01:01:29.519
-Get down and follow me.
-Hey, what's going on?

711
01:01:29.602 --> 01:01:30.895
At the bottom of Half Peak,

712
01:01:32.563 --> 01:01:34.565
there's an ambush waiting for you.

713
01:01:34.649 --> 01:01:36.651
-What?
-What do you mean, ambush?

714
01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:40.238
You set us up.

715
01:01:40.321 --> 01:01:43.116
It was my job! I was supposed to
get the baby, but then...

716
01:01:43.199 --> 01:01:44.826
You brought us home for dinner.

717
01:01:45.159 --> 01:01:46.869
That's it.
You're out of the herd!

718
01:01:47.286 --> 01:01:50.164
-I'm sorry.
-No, you're not. Not yet.

719
01:01:50.248 --> 01:01:51.666
Listen, I can help you.

720
01:01:51.999 --> 01:01:54.085
Stay close, Sid.
We can fight our way out!

721
01:01:54.168 --> 01:01:57.213
You can't! The pack's too strong.
You have to trust me.

722
01:01:57.296 --> 01:01:59.757
Trust you? Why in the world
would we trust you?

723
01:02:00.591 --> 01:02:02.176
Because I'm your only chance.

724
01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:18.151
Hello, ladies.

725
01:02:19.444 --> 01:02:21.487
Hey, look who decided
to show up.

726
01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:24.741
Diego, I was beginning
to worry about you.

727
01:02:25.116 --> 01:02:27.660
No need to worry.
In about two minutes,

728
01:02:27.744 --> 01:02:31.289
you'll be satisfying
your taste for revenge.

729
01:02:31.372 --> 01:02:32.832
Very nice.

730
01:02:33.374 --> 01:02:36.502
I see the sloth,
and he's got the baby!

731
01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:39.422
Don't give away your positions
until you see the mammoth.

732
01:02:39.505 --> 01:02:43.092
-He's the one we have to surprise.
-(whining)

733
01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:45.094
You want to maul something,
don't you, Zeke?

734
01:02:45.178 --> 01:02:46.804
Uh-huh. I wanna maul.

735
01:02:47.805 --> 01:02:50.266
-Then what are you waiting for?
-(roars)

736
01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:54.979
No! I said
wait for the mammoth!

737
01:03:07.867 --> 01:03:09.243
Whoo-hoo!

738
01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:19.712
Whee! Back scratcher!
Ha ha! Eat my powder!

739
01:03:33.684 --> 01:03:36.646
Whee! Oh!
Loop-de-loop!

740
01:03:38.898 --> 01:03:40.650
Slalom! Slalom, baby!

741
01:03:44.445 --> 01:03:45.530
Whoo-hoo!

742
01:03:48.574 --> 01:03:50.076
(screams)

743
01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:10.304
SID: Sorry, fellas!
He got a little frostbite.

744
01:04:12.181 --> 01:04:13.015
Get him!

745
01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:18.604
Surprise!

746
01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:28.239
Okay, follow me. We'll pick up Sid
and get out of here while we can.

747
01:04:28.906 --> 01:04:30.575
Come on, Diego.

748
01:04:30.658 --> 01:04:32.660
Let's bring this mammoth down.

749
01:04:45.214 --> 01:04:47.216
There he is. Ah.

750
01:04:49.552 --> 01:04:51.387
-(growling)
-That's right. Where's the baby?

751
01:04:51.971 --> 01:04:53.431
-(roars)
-(screams)

752
01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:58.519
Survival of the fittest!

753
01:04:59.395 --> 01:05:01.939
I don't think so. Yeah.

754
01:05:13.326 --> 01:05:17.663
-What are you doing?
-Leave the mammoth alone.

755
01:05:20.791 --> 01:05:23.210
Fine. I'll take you down first.

756
01:05:37.058 --> 01:05:38.768
(bellows, trumpets)

757
01:05:39.852 --> 01:05:41.187
(bellows)

758
01:06:14.595 --> 01:06:15.638
(baby yells)

759
01:06:20.893 --> 01:06:21.727
(thud)

760
01:06:33.864 --> 01:06:35.282
(growls)

761
01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:40.705
We did it!

762
01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:56.762
Yeah. We were some team, huh?

763
01:06:58.055 --> 01:07:00.933
Were? Come on.
We're still a team.

764
01:07:01.976 --> 01:07:04.020
I'm, uh, sorry I set you up.

765
01:07:04.979 --> 01:07:07.440
Ah, you know me.
I'm too lazy to hold a grudge.

766
01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:12.570
Hey, knock it off, squirt.

767
01:07:14.321 --> 01:07:15.281
You got to be strong.

768
01:07:16.615 --> 01:07:19.076
You have to take care
of Manfred and Sid.

769
01:07:20.911 --> 01:07:21.912
Especially Sid.

770
01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:26.542
Come on, you can lick this.
You're a tiger.

771
01:07:26.959 --> 01:07:29.253
Look, I'll carry you.
Come on, what do you say?

772
01:07:29.795 --> 01:07:32.256
SID: Come on, Diego, come on.

773
01:07:32.631 --> 01:07:34.341
Tell him he's gonna
be okay, Manny.

774
01:07:36.218 --> 01:07:37.136
DIEGO:
Listen.

775
01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:39.388
You have to leave me here.

776
01:07:40.181 --> 01:07:43.309
If those humans get through the pass,
you'll never catch them.

777
01:07:44.935 --> 01:07:46.062
You didn't have to do that.

778
01:07:48.147 --> 01:07:49.774
That's what you do in a herd.

779
01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:32.626
(growling)

780
01:09:33.919 --> 01:09:35.129
(barking)

781
01:09:43.053 --> 01:09:44.722
(barking, shouting)

782
01:09:44.805 --> 01:09:45.639
(grunts)

783
01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:47.224
(cooing)

784
01:11:06.595 --> 01:11:09.515
Don't forget about us, okay?

785
01:11:13.018 --> 01:11:14.561
We won't forget about you.

786
01:11:55.477 --> 01:11:56.562
<i>SID:</i>
<i>Bye.</i>

787
01:11:58.188 --> 01:12:01.150
-Good-bye. Good-bye.
-Sid.

788
01:12:01.817 --> 01:12:05.112
SID: Bye. Bye.

789
01:12:09.366 --> 01:12:11.243
That's right!
Where's the baby?

790
01:12:11.827 --> 01:12:14.079
Come on, Sid.
Let's head south.

791
01:12:32.389 --> 01:12:33.515
SID: Bye.

792
01:12:35.559 --> 01:12:36.643
Save your breath, Sid.

793
01:12:37.144 --> 01:12:38.520
You know humans can't talk.

794
01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.440
Diego? You're okay!

795
01:12:41.815 --> 01:12:42.900
Nine lives, baby!

796
01:12:42.983 --> 01:12:45.861
Yea! You're okay!
You're okay!

797
01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:49.615
I could kiss you!
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!

798
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:51.825
Yuck! Yuck!
(spits)

799
01:12:51.909 --> 01:12:53.660
Well, welcome back, partner.
Want a lift?

800
01:12:53.994 --> 01:12:56.705
No, thanks. I've got to save
whatever dignity I've got left.

801
01:12:57.081 --> 01:12:58.582
You're hanging out
with us now buddy.

802
01:12:58.665 --> 01:13:01.543
Dignity's got nothing to do with it.
But I'll take that lift.

803
01:13:01.627 --> 01:13:04.129
-Yeah, climb aboard.
-Pick me up, buddy.

804
01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:05.381
Yee-ha! Mush!

805
01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:08.300
Or not mush. Either way.

806
01:13:11.970 --> 01:13:14.515
This is gonna be
the best migration ever!

807
01:13:14.848 --> 01:13:17.101
I'm tellin' ya, I'll show you
all my favorite watering holes.

808
01:13:17.184 --> 01:13:19.520
And I turn brown when the fungus
in my fur dries out.

809
01:13:19.603 --> 01:13:20.896
Yeah, sounds very attractive.

810
01:13:20.979 --> 01:13:23.565
You know, this whole
Ice Age thing's getting old.

811
01:13:23.649 --> 01:13:25.901
You know what I could go for?
Global warming.

812
01:13:26.318 --> 01:13:27.945
-MANFRED: Oy.
-DIEGO: Keep dreaming.

813
01:13:28.028 --> 01:13:28.862
No, really!

814
01:14:16.410 --> 01:14:20.539
(grunting)

815
01:14:23.417 --> 01:14:24.418

816
01:14:28.338 --> 01:14:33.093

817

818
01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:49.860
(thump)

819
01:15:22.392 --> 01:15:25.354
