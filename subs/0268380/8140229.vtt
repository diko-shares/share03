00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.909
Why not call it the Big Chill
or the Nippy Era?

2
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.868
I'm just sayin',
how do we know it's an ice age?

3
00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.868
Because of all the ice!

4
00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:59.388
Well, things just got a little chillier.

5
00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:02.868
Help. Help.

6
00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:06.107
Come on, kids. Let's go.
The traffic's movin'.

7
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.388
But, Dad...

8
00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:11.187
No buts.
You can play extinction later.

9
00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:14.747
OK. Come on, guys.

10
00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:16.987
So, where's Eddie?

11
00:04:17.108 --> 00:04:20.748
He said something about being
on the verge of an evolutionary breakthrough.

12
00:04:20.828 --> 00:04:22.427
Really?

13
00:04:23.348 --> 00:04:25.826
I'm flying!

14
00:04:27.108 --> 00:04:29.187
Some breakthrough.

15
00:04:29.788 --> 00:04:33.627
- Look out!
- You're going the wrong way.

16
00:04:33.667 --> 00:04:35.866
Crazy mammoth!

17
00:04:41.107 --> 00:04:46.626
Hey! Do the world a favour.
Move your issues off the road.

18
00:04:46.707 --> 00:04:51.146
If my trunk was that small,
I wouldn't draw attention to myself, pal.

19
00:04:51.226 --> 00:04:54.746
Give me a break.
We've been waddlin' all day.

20
00:04:56.507 --> 00:04:59.146
Go ahead, follow the crowd.

21
00:04:59.226 --> 00:05:01.425
It'll be quieter when you're gone.

22
00:05:02.267 --> 00:05:05.624
Come on. If he wants to
freeze to death, let him.

23
00:05:14.945 --> 00:05:17.184
I'm up.

24
00:05:19.265 --> 00:05:22.024
Rise and shine, everybody.

25
00:05:22.105 --> 00:05:24.424
Zak? Marshall?

26
00:05:24.506 --> 00:05:27.664
Bertie? Uncle Fungus?

27
00:05:27.704 --> 00:05:31.423
Where is everybody?
Come on, guys, we're gonna miss the mi...

28
00:05:31.505 --> 00:05:34.424
the mi... gration.

29
00:05:35.984 --> 00:05:40.903
They left without me.
They do this every year.

30
00:05:42.264 --> 00:05:45.143
Why? Doesn't anyone love me?

31
00:05:45.184 --> 00:05:49.743
Isn't there anyone
who cares about Sid the Sloth?

32
00:05:52.304 --> 00:05:54.422
All right, I'll just go by myself.

33
00:05:56.664 --> 00:05:58.102
Sick!

34
00:05:58.143 --> 00:06:01.142
Hey, wide body!
Kerb it next time.

35
00:06:01.264 --> 00:06:03.662
Oh, jeez.
Oh, yuck!

36
00:06:03.703 --> 00:06:06.542
I can't believe it.
Fresh wild greens.

37
00:06:06.583 --> 00:06:09.302
Frank, where did you ever...?

38
00:06:09.382 --> 00:06:12.382
- Go ahead. Dig in.
- A dandelion.

39
00:06:12.463 --> 00:06:15.901
- I thought the frost wiped 'em all out.
- All but one.

40
00:06:17.102 --> 00:06:20.982
It makes me so...
I wanna... Yuck.

41
00:06:21.022 --> 00:06:25.341
This has definitely not been my day.
You know what I'm sayin', buddy?

42
00:06:25.421 --> 00:06:29.301
What a mess. You rhinos have
really tiny brains. Did you know that?

43
00:06:29.382 --> 00:06:34.100
It's just a fact. No offence. You probably
don't even know what I'm talkin' about.

44
00:06:35.021 --> 00:06:36.221
Yummo.

45
00:06:36.302 --> 00:06:39.860
A dandelion.
Must be the last one of the season.

46
00:06:42.262 --> 00:06:44.500
- Carl...
- Easy, Frank.

47
00:06:44.582 --> 00:06:46.980
He ruined our salad.

48
00:06:47.861 --> 00:06:50.660
My mistake.
That was my mistake. Let me...

49
00:06:51.141 --> 00:06:53.659
Seriously, let me take care of this.

50
00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.300
What is this?
Pine cones.

51
00:06:56.341 --> 00:06:59.219
Oh, my goodness.
They're my favourite.

52
00:07:00.181 --> 00:07:04.539
Delicious.
That's good eating.

53
00:07:04.621 --> 00:07:08.019
But don't let me hog them all up.
Here, you have some.

54
00:07:08.059 --> 00:07:11.019
<i>Tasty, isn't it?
Bon appétit.</i>

55
00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:13.099
Now?

56
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.579
Now.

57
00:07:25.019 --> 00:07:28.978
- Just pretend that I'm not here.
- I wanted to hit him at full speed.

58
00:07:29.019 --> 00:07:34.137
- That's OK. We'll have some fun with him.
- Don't let them impale me. I wanna live.

59
00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:37.017
- Get off me.
- Come on, you're makin' a scene.

60
00:07:37.099 --> 00:07:40.178
We'll just take our furry piñata and go.

61
00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:43.177
Buddy, if it's not them today,
it's just someone else tomorrow.

62
00:07:43.218 --> 00:07:45.577
Well, I'd rather it not be today. OK?

63
00:07:45.618 --> 00:07:48.897
Look, we'll break your neck
so you don't feel a thing. How's that?

64
00:07:48.978 --> 00:07:51.937
Wait a minute.
I thought rhinos were vegetarians.

65
00:07:52.017 --> 00:07:54.096
- An excellent point.
- Shut up.

66
00:07:54.138 --> 00:07:56.657
Who says we're gonna eat him
after we kill him?

67
00:07:56.698 --> 00:07:57.697
Yeah, move it.

68
00:07:57.777 --> 00:08:00.537
You know, I don't like animals
that kill for pleasure.

69
00:08:00.617 --> 00:08:03.896
- Save it for a mammal that cares.
- I'm a mammal that cares.

70
00:08:03.977 --> 00:08:09.256
OK, if either of you make it across that
sinkhole in front of ya, you get the sloth.

71
00:08:09.297 --> 00:08:12.856
That's right, you losers.
You take one step and you're dead.

72
00:08:16.897 --> 00:08:20.696
- You were bluffing, huh?
- Yeah, that was a bluff.

73
00:08:21.336 --> 00:08:23.135
Get him!

74
00:08:57.615 --> 00:08:59.773
A dandelion?

75
00:09:02.574 --> 00:09:05.133
We did it!

76
00:09:12.494 --> 00:09:16.613
- You have beautiful eyes.
- Get off my face.

77
00:09:17.293 --> 00:09:21.292
Whoa, you and me, we make a great team.
What do you say we head south together?

78
00:09:21.334 --> 00:09:23.692
Great. Jump on my back
and relax the whole way.

79
00:09:23.773 --> 00:09:25.732
- Wow, really?
- No.

80
00:09:25.773 --> 00:09:30.132
Wait, aren't you going south?
The change of seasons, migration instincts.

81
00:09:30.213 --> 00:09:32.892
- Any of this a-ringin' a bell?
- I guess not. Bye.

82
00:09:32.973 --> 00:09:35.771
OK, then. Thanks for the help.
I can take it from here.

83
00:09:36.773 --> 00:09:40.332
Hey, you overgrown weasel.
Wait till we get down there.

84
00:09:41.053 --> 00:09:44.691
That whole south thing is way overrated.
The heat, the crowds - who needs it?

85
00:09:44.773 --> 00:09:49.171
Isn't this great? You and me,
two bachelors knockin' about in the wild.

86
00:09:49.252 --> 00:09:52.931
No. You just want a bodyguard
so you don't become somebody's side dish.

87
00:09:52.972 --> 00:09:55.211
You're a very shrewd mammal.

88
00:09:55.292 --> 00:09:58.131
OK then, you lead the way, Mr Big...
Didn't get the name.

89
00:09:58.212 --> 00:10:00.010
- Manfred.
- Yuck.

90
00:10:00.051 --> 00:10:05.929
How about Manny the Moody Mammoth?
Or Manny the Melancholy... Manny the...

91
00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:09.649
Stop following me.

92
00:10:11.251 --> 00:10:16.769
OK, so you've got issues. You won't
even know I'm here. I'll just zip the lip.

93
00:10:58.728 --> 00:11:02.887
Look at the cute little baby, Diego.

94
00:11:05.168 --> 00:11:10.407
- Isn't it nice he'll be joining us for breakfast?
- It wouldn't be breakfast without him.

95
00:11:10.448 --> 00:11:16.006
Especially since his daddy wiped out half
our pack and wears our skin to keep warm.

96
00:11:16.087 --> 00:11:19.087
An eye for an eye, don't you think?

97
00:11:19.167 --> 00:11:22.606
Let's show that human what happens
when he messes with sabres.

98
00:11:22.688 --> 00:11:26.687
Alert the troops.
We attack at dawn.

99
00:11:26.727 --> 00:11:31.166
And, Diego, bring me that baby alive.

100
00:11:31.207 --> 00:11:36.366
If I'm gonna enjoy my revenge,
I want it to be fresh.

101
00:11:57.526 --> 00:12:00.805
- I'm wiped out.
- That's your shelter?

102
00:12:00.885 --> 00:12:03.684
You're a big guy.
You got a lotta wood. I'm a little guy.

103
00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:05.524
You got half a stick.

104
00:12:05.605 --> 00:12:11.724
But with my little stick and my highly
evolved brain, I shall create fire.

105
00:12:12.125 --> 00:12:13.844
Fascinating.

106
00:12:14.165 --> 00:12:18.644
We'll see if brains triumph
over brawn tonight. Now, won't we?

107
00:12:23.204 --> 00:12:25.123
Think I saw a spark.

108
00:12:29.484 --> 00:12:32.843
Any chance I could squeeze
in there with you, Manny, ol' pal?

109
00:12:32.924 --> 00:12:35.722
Isn't there someone else you can annoy?

110
00:12:35.804 --> 00:12:39.203
Friends? Family?
Poisonous reptiles?

111
00:12:39.283 --> 00:12:44.083
My family abandoned me.
They just kinda migrated without me.

112
00:12:44.164 --> 00:12:46.402
You should see what they did last year.

113
00:12:46.444 --> 00:12:49.442
They woke up early
and tied my hands and feet

114
00:12:49.483 --> 00:12:52.203
and they gagged me with a fieldmouse,
and barricaded the cave door,

115
00:12:52.283 --> 00:12:55.762
covered their tracks,
went through water so I'd lose their scent,

116
00:12:55.842 --> 00:12:58.882
and... who needs 'em, anyway?

117
00:13:02.883 --> 00:13:05.601
So what about you?
You have family?

118
00:13:08.922 --> 00:13:12.282
OK, you're tired. I see.
Well, we'll talk more in the morning.

119
00:13:14.642 --> 00:13:16.361
Manfred?

120
00:13:16.442 --> 00:13:19.001
Could you scooch over a drop?

121
00:13:19.041 --> 00:13:22.040
Come on.
Nobody falls asleep that fast.

122
00:13:22.082 --> 00:13:24.000
Manny!

123
00:16:07.993 --> 00:16:10.153
There's Diego. Fall back.

124
00:16:16.353 --> 00:16:19.071
- Where's the baby?
- I lost it over the falls.

125
00:16:19.113 --> 00:16:21.752
You lost it?

126
00:16:24.473 --> 00:16:26.952
- I want that baby.
- I'll get it.

127
00:16:27.032 --> 00:16:30.591
You'd better, unless you want
to serve yourself as a replacement.

128
00:16:30.673 --> 00:16:35.031
We'll go up to Half Peak.
Meet us there.

129
00:16:35.072 --> 00:16:37.631
It had better be alive.

130
00:16:38.432 --> 00:16:40.871
Can we trust you with that, Diego?

131
00:16:40.952 --> 00:16:43.350
Let's go!

132
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:08.869
She picked a hair off my shoulder and says,
"If you're gonna have an extra mating dance,

133
00:17:08.951 --> 00:17:11.429
at least pick a female
with the same colour pelt."

134
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:14.590
I thought, "She's gonna go
praying mantis on me."

135
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:18.710
If you find a mate in life, you should be loyal.
In your case, grateful.

136
00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:21.628
- Now get away from me.
- I think mating for life is stupid.

137
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:24.549
There's plenty of Sid to go around.

138
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:29.068
Manny?

139
00:18:20.787 --> 00:18:24.146
Look at that. He's OK.

140
00:18:34.827 --> 00:18:36.625
She's gone.

141
00:18:46.506 --> 00:18:49.025
Hey, Manny. Are you forgetting something?

142
00:18:49.105 --> 00:18:50.305
No.

143
00:18:50.386 --> 00:18:54.305
- But you just saved him.
- I'm trying to get rid of the last thing I saved.

144
00:18:54.386 --> 00:18:56.784
But you can't leave him here.

145
00:19:00.585 --> 00:19:03.983
Look, there's smoke.
That's his herd right up the hill.

146
00:19:04.065 --> 00:19:08.024
- We should return him.
- Let's get this straight. There is no "we".

147
00:19:08.105 --> 00:19:12.664
There never was a "we".
In fact, without me, there wouldn't be a "you".

148
00:19:14.385 --> 00:19:20.983
- Just up the hill.
- Listen very carefully. I'm not going.

149
00:19:21.064 --> 00:19:26.703
- Fine, be a jerk. I'll take care of him.
- Oh, yeah. That's good.

150
00:19:26.784 --> 00:19:29.342
You can't even take care of yourself.
This, I gotta see.

151
00:19:29.423 --> 00:19:33.502
I'll return you. We don't need
that meany-weany mammoth, do we?

152
00:19:33.583 --> 00:19:35.622
No, we don't.

153
00:20:03.502 --> 00:20:06.101
You're an embarrassment to nature.
Do you know that?

154
00:20:07.581 --> 00:20:10.381
This is cake. I'm fine.

155
00:20:10.421 --> 00:20:12.141
I'm gonna die.

156
00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.220
Manny!

157
00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:44.140
- That pink thing is mine.
- Actually, that pink thing belongs to us.

158
00:20:47.059 --> 00:20:50.379
"Us"? You two are a bit of an odd couple.

159
00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.139
There is no "us".

160
00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.178
I see. Can't have one of your own,
so you want to adopt.

161
00:20:55.219 --> 00:20:58.458
Look, I'm sorry to interrupt
your snack, but we gotta go.

162
00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:02.059
The baby? Please.
I was returning him to his herd.

163
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.297
- Nice try, bucktooth.
- You callin' me a liar?

164
00:21:05.379 --> 00:21:07.937
- I didn't say that.
- You were thinkin' it.

165
00:21:07.979 --> 00:21:11.418
I don't like this cat.
He reads minds.

166
00:21:11.498 --> 00:21:14.897
- Name's Diego, friend.
- Manfred, and I'm not your friend.

167
00:21:14.979 --> 00:21:18.457
Fine, Manfred.

168
00:21:18.539 --> 00:21:21.937
If you're lookin' for the humans,
you're wastin' your time. They left.

169
00:21:22.018 --> 00:21:25.097
Thanks for the advice.
Now beat it.

170
00:21:25.138 --> 00:21:29.057
All right, I'll help you bring it to its herd,
but promise me to leave me alone after that.

171
00:21:29.098 --> 00:21:32.337
- OK, deal. What's your problem?
- You are my problem.

172
00:21:32.418 --> 00:21:36.816
I think you're stressed, so you eat too much.
It's hard to get fat on a vegan diet.

173
00:21:36.897 --> 00:21:40.816
I'm not fat. It's all this fur.
It makes me look poofy.

174
00:21:40.897 --> 00:21:44.656
All right, you have fat hair.
But when you're ready to talk, I'm here.

175
00:21:47.617 --> 00:21:50.696
What are you doin'?
Just drop it on the ledge.

176
00:21:50.737 --> 00:21:54.016
- Shouldn't we make sure they found him?
- Good idea.

177
00:21:54.057 --> 00:21:56.496
No, no. Wait.

178
00:21:56.576 --> 00:21:58.975
Don't spear me.

179
00:22:01.896 --> 00:22:04.535
- This is a problem.
- Now what?

180
00:22:05.655 --> 00:22:08.015
That's perfect.

181
00:22:36.855 --> 00:22:39.373
- I told you they were gone.
- Well, look who it is.

182
00:22:39.454 --> 00:22:41.893
Don't you have some
poor animal to disembowel?

183
00:22:41.934 --> 00:22:45.773
They couldn't be far.
I mean, they went this way, or this way?

184
00:22:45.853 --> 00:22:48.133
You don't know much
about tracking, do you?

185
00:22:48.214 --> 00:22:51.892
I'm a sloth. I see a tree, eat a leaf.
That's my tracking.

186
00:22:51.974 --> 00:22:54.213
You didn't miss them by much.

187
00:22:54.254 --> 00:22:57.492
It's still green.
They headed north two hours ago.

188
00:22:57.573 --> 00:22:59.772
"They headed north two hours ago."

189
00:23:04.134 --> 00:23:06.692
You don't need this aggravation.

190
00:23:07.652 --> 00:23:11.372
Give me the baby. I can track
humans down a lot faster than you.

191
00:23:11.452 --> 00:23:14.052
And you're just
a good citizen helpin' out, right?

192
00:23:14.093 --> 00:23:17.452
- I just know where the humans are going.
- Glacier Pass.

193
00:23:17.532 --> 00:23:20.332
Everybody knows they have
a settlement on the other side.

194
00:23:21.891 --> 00:23:26.652
Unless you know how to track, you'll never
reach them before snow closes the pass.

195
00:23:26.692 --> 00:23:29.570
Which should be, like, tomorrow.

196
00:23:29.612 --> 00:23:35.411
So, you can give that baby to me,
or go get lost in a blizzard. It's your choice.

197
00:23:41.771 --> 00:23:45.570
Here's your little bundle of joy.
We're returning it to the humans.

198
00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:51.249
The big, bad tigey-wigey gets left behind.
Poor tigey-wigey.

199
00:23:51.331 --> 00:23:54.090
Sid, tigey-wigey is gonna lead the way.

200
00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:00.889
- Manny, can I talk to you for a second?
- No.

201
00:24:00.931 --> 00:24:04.770
The sooner we find the humans,
the sooner I get rid of Mr Stinky Drool-Face,

202
00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:07.329
and the baby, too.

203
00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:10.849
You won't always have
Jumbo around to protect you.

204
00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:16.369
And when that day comes, I suggest you
watch your back, cos I'll be chewin' on it.

205
00:24:16.449 --> 00:24:20.049
Hey, über-tracker.
Up front, where I can see you.

206
00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:21.648
Help me.

207
00:24:36.369 --> 00:24:40.288
You gotta make it stop.
I can't take it any more.

208
00:24:40.369 --> 00:24:44.447
- I've eaten things that complained less.
- He won't stop squirming.

209
00:24:44.488 --> 00:24:46.567
- Watch its head.
- Just put it down.

210
00:24:46.648 --> 00:24:49.086
Jeez, "pick him up, put him down..."

211
00:24:49.168 --> 00:24:52.487
- Its nose is dry.
- That means something's wrong with it.

212
00:24:52.568 --> 00:24:55.487
- Someone should lick it. Just in case.
- I'll do it.

213
00:24:55.527 --> 00:24:57.886
- He's wearing one of those baby thingies.
- So?

214
00:24:57.968 --> 00:25:00.646
So if he poops, where does it go?

215
00:25:02.687 --> 00:25:06.686
- Humans are disgusting.
- OK, you. Check for poop.

216
00:25:06.768 --> 00:25:09.726
- Why am I the poop-checker?
- Because returning him was your idea,

217
00:25:09.767 --> 00:25:13.405
because you're small and insignificant,
and because I'll pummel you if you don't.

218
00:25:13.447 --> 00:25:16.286
- Why else?
- Now, Sid!

219
00:25:20.007 --> 00:25:23.525
Yuck! I mean, my goodness.

220
00:25:23.606 --> 00:25:25.885
- Look out. Coming through.
- Watch out!

221
00:25:25.967 --> 00:25:29.045
- Stop wavin' that thing around.
- I'm gonna slip.

222
00:25:34.086 --> 00:25:36.964
It's clean. Got ya.

223
00:25:38.366 --> 00:25:40.765
Will you cut it out?

224
00:25:41.845 --> 00:25:43.965
Do that again. He likes it.

225
00:25:46.806 --> 00:25:48.844
It's makin' me feel better too.

226
00:25:49.966 --> 00:25:52.364
Here, you hold it.

227
00:25:58.365 --> 00:26:00.123
Turn him towards me.

228
00:26:00.165 --> 00:26:03.323
Where's the baby?

229
00:26:03.364 --> 00:26:05.602
There he is.

230
00:26:05.684 --> 00:26:08.963
Where's the baby?

231
00:26:09.044 --> 00:26:10.043
There he is.

232
00:26:12.084 --> 00:26:14.523
Stop it. You're scarin' him.

233
00:26:18.484 --> 00:26:20.842
- I bet he's hungry.
- How about some milk?

234
00:26:20.924 --> 00:26:23.802
- I'd love some.
- Not you. The baby.

235
00:26:23.883 --> 00:26:26.482
Well, I ain't exactly lactating right now, pal.

236
00:26:26.523 --> 00:26:28.562
You're a little low on the food chain
to mouth off...

237
00:26:28.603 --> 00:26:30.243
Enough!

238
00:26:34.843 --> 00:26:36.762
Food.

239
00:26:44.683 --> 00:26:48.642
I don't know, but I've been told!

240
00:26:48.722 --> 00:26:52.721
End of the world be mighty cold!

241
00:26:53.122 --> 00:26:55.481
Prepare for the ice age.

242
00:26:55.561 --> 00:26:58.001
Protect the dodo way of life.

243
00:26:58.042 --> 00:27:02.201
Survival separates the dodos from the beasts.

244
00:27:05.721 --> 00:27:08.040
Prepare for the ice age.

245
00:27:08.122 --> 00:27:11.000
- Ice age?
- I've heard of these crackpots.

246
00:27:13.721 --> 00:27:16.160
- Intruders!
- Now, don't fall in.

247
00:27:16.241 --> 00:27:19.080
- If you do, you will definitely...
- Intruders!

248
00:27:21.561 --> 00:27:23.719
..burn and die.

249
00:27:24.721 --> 00:27:27.799
Can we have our melon back?
Junior's hungry and...

250
00:27:27.881 --> 00:27:31.039
No way. This is our private
stockpile for the ice age.

251
00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:34.759
Subarctic temperatures will force us
underground for a billion years.

252
00:27:35.159 --> 00:27:37.638
So you got three melons?

253
00:27:38.599 --> 00:27:42.479
If you weren't smart enough
to plan ahead, then doom on you.

254
00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.678
Doom on you.
Doom on you.

255
00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.558
Get away from me.

256
00:27:48.879 --> 00:27:50.479
Oh, no! No!

257
00:27:51.559 --> 00:27:55.317
Retrieve the melon.
Tae kwon dodos, attack!

258
00:28:06.199 --> 00:28:08.198
The melon!

259
00:28:11.038 --> 00:28:13.637
There goes our last female.

260
00:28:20.598 --> 00:28:23.277
- Got it.
- Don't got it.

261
00:28:25.077 --> 00:28:27.556
The last melon.

262
00:29:50.074 --> 00:29:54.552
Ah, Sid!
Now we gotta find more food.

263
00:29:56.913 --> 00:29:59.631
More to the right.

264
00:30:00.672 --> 00:30:02.432
Look at that. Dinner and a show.

265
00:30:02.513 --> 00:30:04.432
Left!

266
00:30:10.193 --> 00:30:13.791
Now to find a meal
befitting a conquering hero.

267
00:30:16.232 --> 00:30:20.071
What ho? A foe? Come on.
You want a piece of me?

268
00:30:22.751 --> 00:30:25.871
Spoils worthy of such a noble...

269
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:36.110
Bedtime, squirt.

270
00:30:44.431 --> 00:30:47.469
Oh, the triumphant return.

271
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:49.709
Oh, that.

272
00:30:50.671 --> 00:30:55.149
I'm so full. How about a good-night
kiss for your big buddy, Sid?

273
00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:58.629
- He's asleep.
- I was talking to you.

274
00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:02.349
Fine, I'll tuck myself in.

275
00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:10.908
All right, good night.

276
00:31:32.109 --> 00:31:34.187
Will you stop it?

277
00:31:34.269 --> 00:31:37.587
All right, all right.
I was trying to relax.

278
00:31:42.748 --> 00:31:44.347
Oy.

279
00:32:30.865 --> 00:32:34.065
- What the...?
- Slice me. It'll be the last thing you ever do.

280
00:32:34.145 --> 00:32:37.304
- I'm workin' here, you waste of fur.
- Frustrated, Diego?

281
00:32:37.385 --> 00:32:40.664
Tracking down helpless infants
too difficult for you?

282
00:32:40.745 --> 00:32:45.024
- What are you two doin' here?
- Soto's getting tired of waiting.

283
00:32:45.065 --> 00:32:50.064
He said, "Come back with the baby,
or don't come back at all."

284
00:32:51.304 --> 00:32:53.503
Well, I have a message for Soto.

285
00:32:53.544 --> 00:32:56.263
Tell him I'm bringing the baby.

286
00:32:57.064 --> 00:33:01.262
And tell him I'm bringing a mammoth.

287
00:33:01.945 --> 00:33:04.503
- A mammoth?
- Mammoths never travel alone.

288
00:33:04.584 --> 00:33:08.743
This one does,
and I'm leading him to Half Peak.

289
00:33:09.944 --> 00:33:12.183
Look at all that meat.
Let's get him.

290
00:33:12.263 --> 00:33:16.382
Not yet. We'll need the whole pack
to bring this mammoth down.

291
00:33:16.423 --> 00:33:18.982
Get everyone ready.

292
00:33:19.023 --> 00:33:21.062
Now.

293
00:33:43.261 --> 00:33:46.741
- Where's the baby?
- You lost it?

294
00:33:47.822 --> 00:33:49.061
Sid!

295
00:33:49.822 --> 00:33:53.300
It's so ugly.
Positively adorable.

296
00:33:53.381 --> 00:33:57.180
Hello, pumpkin.
Hello, little baldy bean.

297
00:33:57.221 --> 00:34:01.140
- Where'd you find it?
- The poor kid, all alone in the wild.

298
00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.380
Sabres were closing in on him.

299
00:34:03.461 --> 00:34:06.500
- So I just snatched him.
- So brave.

300
00:34:06.581 --> 00:34:11.020
Yeah, well... He needed me,
and I only wish I had one of my own, too.

301
00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:14.900
Really? I find that attractive in a male.

302
00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:19.179
Alas. Who wouldn't want
a family, I always say.

303
00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:22.819
- Where've you been hiding?
- Yeah, well... You know...

304
00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:30.339
Cute kid, huh?
So, as I was saying, ladies...

305
00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:36.259
- Hi, Manny.
- What's the matter with you?

306
00:34:37.219 --> 00:34:41.938
Excuse me, ladies. You just keep
marinating and I'll be right back.

307
00:34:43.939 --> 00:34:45.377
Sexy.

308
00:34:46.339 --> 00:34:49.578
He's not much to look at,
but it's so hard to find a family guy.

309
00:34:49.658 --> 00:34:53.057
Tell me about it.
All the sensitive ones get eaten.

310
00:34:53.538 --> 00:34:57.017
No, no, no, Manny.
Please, I'm begging you. I need him.

311
00:34:57.058 --> 00:34:59.217
What? A good-lookin' guy like you?

312
00:34:59.298 --> 00:35:02.297
- You say that, but you don't mean it.
- No, seriously. Look at you.

313
00:35:02.339 --> 00:35:04.897
Those ladies, they don't stand a chance.

314
00:35:04.977 --> 00:35:08.377
- You have a very cruel sense of humour.
- Don't let me cramp your style.

315
00:35:08.418 --> 00:35:10.176
Thanks. You're a pal.

316
00:35:10.258 --> 00:35:13.696
- Without Pinky.
- Manny, I need him.

317
00:35:17.097 --> 00:35:20.017
So, ladies, where were we?

318
00:35:20.097 --> 00:35:23.776
- Carl...
- Easy, Frank.

319
00:35:25.497 --> 00:35:29.655
Pretty tail walks by, suddenly he moves
like a cheetah. And that tiger...

320
00:35:29.696 --> 00:35:33.375
Yeah, Mr Great Tracker.
Can't even find a sloth.

321
00:35:33.456 --> 00:35:37.176
What am I, the wet nurse?
What are you lookin' at, bone bag?

322
00:35:39.296 --> 00:35:42.935
Look at you. You're gonna
grow into a great predator.

323
00:35:42.976 --> 00:35:47.494
I don't think so. What have you got?
You got a little patch of fur.

324
00:35:47.576 --> 00:35:50.015
No fangs, no claws.

325
00:35:50.096 --> 00:35:55.454
You're folds of skin wrapped in mush.
What's so threatening about you?

326
00:36:00.855 --> 00:36:04.094
Does this look like
a petting zoo to you? Huh?

327
00:36:06.895 --> 00:36:10.373
OK. All right, wise guy.
You just earned a time-out.

328
00:36:13.054 --> 00:36:16.254
You think that's funny?
How about this?

329
00:36:17.534 --> 00:36:19.973
A little snack for the owls.

330
00:36:22.374 --> 00:36:25.732
You're a brave little squirt,
I'll give you that.

331
00:36:31.214 --> 00:36:32.892
Thank goodness.

332
00:36:32.974 --> 00:36:35.773
Oh, no! A tiger.

333
00:36:35.814 --> 00:36:38.252
Help! Help!

334
00:36:38.334 --> 00:36:40.533
- Where's the baby?
- Manfred has him.

335
00:36:40.573 --> 00:36:43.451
Just put me in your mouth.
Come on, hurry up.

336
00:36:43.493 --> 00:36:46.452
He got me. Help.

337
00:36:46.533 --> 00:36:50.452
- Get away from me.
- It went this way. Over here.

338
00:36:58.972 --> 00:37:02.651
No, Carl...
The tiger beat us to him.

339
00:37:03.171 --> 00:37:05.690
Wait a minute.

340
00:37:10.412 --> 00:37:14.970
- He's dead all right.
- No... Carnivores have all the fun.

341
00:37:17.292 --> 00:37:21.730
Oh, gosh. I hate breaking their hearts
like that. But you know how it is.

342
00:37:22.691 --> 00:37:25.810
All right, thanks.
You can put me down now.

343
00:37:25.851 --> 00:37:28.010
Manny!

344
00:37:28.091 --> 00:37:30.170
Guys, I thought we were in a hurry.

345
00:37:30.251 --> 00:37:34.010
And, Diego, spit that out.
You don't know where it's been.

346
00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:38.810
Boy. For a second there,
I actually thought you were gonna eat me.

347
00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:41.849
- I don't eat junk food.
- Thought you were gonna...

348
00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:44.769
I thought you were gonna... Were you?

349
00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:49.688
Come on, wait up.

350
00:37:49.729 --> 00:37:52.968
Can you wait a second, please?
Hey, fellas...

351
00:37:55.049 --> 00:37:57.049
Thanks for waiting.

352
00:37:57.089 --> 00:37:59.687
Three, two, one...

353
00:38:02.449 --> 00:38:04.848
Sure is faithful.

354
00:38:18.488 --> 00:38:20.768
- Don't make me reach back.
- He started it.

355
00:38:20.848 --> 00:38:22.967
I don't care who started it.
I'll finish it.

356
00:38:55.366 --> 00:38:58.166
Modern architecture.
It'll never last.

357
00:39:11.927 --> 00:39:14.005
Hiya, Manny.

358
00:39:15.726 --> 00:39:18.005
Hi, Diego.

359
00:39:24.686 --> 00:39:26.644
Hey, Sid.

360
00:39:26.965 --> 00:39:30.564
- You're lost, aren't you?
- No, I know exactly where we are.

361
00:39:30.645 --> 00:39:32.884
Ask him directions.

362
00:39:32.964 --> 00:39:35.524
- I don't need directions.
- Fine. I'll ask him.

363
00:39:35.604 --> 00:39:38.843
Buddy, you see any humans go by here?

364
00:39:41.684 --> 00:39:44.523
I love this game. OK, OK...

365
00:39:44.565 --> 00:39:48.883
Three words.
First word. Stomp. No. Stamp.

366
00:39:48.924 --> 00:39:50.963
Let me try...
Pack.

367
00:39:51.043 --> 00:39:55.162
Good one, Manny.
Pack of... Long teeth and claws.

368
00:39:56.644 --> 00:39:58.602
Pack of wolves?
Pack of...

369
00:39:58.644 --> 00:40:01.282
Pack of bears?
Pack of fleas?

370
00:40:01.363 --> 00:40:03.322
Pack of whiskers?
Pack of noses?

371
00:40:03.403 --> 00:40:05.763
- Pachyderm?
- Pack of lies.

372
00:40:05.843 --> 00:40:07.682
Pack of troubles.
Pack a wallop.

373
00:40:07.763 --> 00:40:10.362
Pack of birds.
Pack of flying fish.

374
00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:00.640
Hey, great news.
I found a short cut.

375
00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:07.278
- What do you mean, short cut?
- I mean faster than the long way around.

376
00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.599
I know what a short cut is.

377
00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:14.639
Look, either we beat the humans to Glacier
Pass or we take the long way and miss 'em.

378
00:41:14.679 --> 00:41:18.398
Through there?
What do you take me for?

379
00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:21.759
This time tomorrow,
you could be a free mammoth.

380
00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:24.679
Or a nanny.
Personally, I never get tired of peekaboo.

381
00:41:24.719 --> 00:41:27.558
Hey, guys. Check this out.

382
00:41:29.638 --> 00:41:31.718
Sid, the tiger found a short cut.

383
00:41:34.319 --> 00:41:38.877
- No, thanks. I choose life.
- Then I suggest you take the short cut.

384
00:41:38.958 --> 00:41:42.038
- Are you threatening me?
- Move, sloth!

385
00:41:47.278 --> 00:41:48.797
Way to go, tiger.

386
00:41:49.958 --> 00:41:52.037
Quick. Inside.

387
00:42:14.077 --> 00:42:16.955
OK, I vote short cut.

388
00:42:30.556 --> 00:42:34.195
Come on, guys. Stick together.
It's easy to get lost in here.

389
00:42:49.115 --> 00:42:51.114
Guys?

390
00:43:07.714 --> 00:43:09.674
A fish.

391
00:43:50.313 --> 00:43:55.270
Will you keep up, please?
Hard enough to keep track of one baby.

392
00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:39.588
I gotcha.

393
00:44:55.549 --> 00:44:58.028
Captain, iceberg ahead.

394
00:45:04.069 --> 00:45:05.147
Oh, no.

395
00:45:55.545 --> 00:45:58.425
Yeah! Who's up for round two?

396
00:46:01.826 --> 00:46:04.784
Tell the kid to be more careful.

397
00:46:43.423 --> 00:46:45.143
Look. Tigers.

398
00:46:48.104 --> 00:46:52.742
It's OK. Look, the tigers are just
playing tag with the antelope.

399
00:46:54.703 --> 00:46:58.982
- With their teeth.
- Come on, Sid. Let's play tag.

400
00:46:59.062 --> 00:47:01.062
You're it.

401
00:47:02.223 --> 00:47:05.302
Sure. OK, OK, OK.
Where are the sloths?

402
00:47:05.342 --> 00:47:08.342
You know, you never see any sloths.
Have you ever noticed?

403
00:47:08.382 --> 00:47:11.742
- Look, Manny. A mammoth.
- Somebody pinch me.

404
00:47:11.782 --> 00:47:15.661
This fat one looks just like you.

405
00:47:15.743 --> 00:47:17.861
And he's got a family.

406
00:47:17.943 --> 00:47:21.221
And he's happy.
Look, he's playing with his kid.

407
00:47:21.301 --> 00:47:24.980
See, Manny? That's your problem.
That's what mammoths are supposed to do.

408
00:47:25.021 --> 00:47:27.580
- Sid...
- Find a she-mmoth, have baby mammoths...

409
00:47:27.622 --> 00:47:29.340
- Sid.
- What?

410
00:47:29.381 --> 00:47:31.539
- Shut up.
- But...

411
00:50:50.332 --> 00:50:52.531
Well, would you look at that.

412
00:50:52.611 --> 00:50:55.571
The tiger actually did it.
There's Half Peak.

413
00:50:55.652 --> 00:50:58.250
Next stop, Glacier Pass.

414
00:50:58.292 --> 00:51:02.210
- How could I ever have doubted you?
- Did you hear that, little fella?

415
00:51:02.291 --> 00:51:04.570
You're almost home.

416
00:51:08.851 --> 00:51:09.850
My feet are sweating.

417
00:51:09.931 --> 00:51:13.049
Do we have to get a newsflash
every time your body does something?

418
00:51:13.131 --> 00:51:17.730
- Just ignore him.
- Seriously. My feet are really hot.

419
00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:25.449
Tell me that was your stomach.

420
00:51:25.489 --> 00:51:27.650
I'm sure it was just thunder.

421
00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:30.769
From underground?

422
00:51:49.969 --> 00:51:52.048
Come on.
Keep up with me.

423
00:51:52.088 --> 00:51:53.968
I would if you were moving.

424
00:51:57.328 --> 00:52:00.128
- I wish I could jump like that.
- Wish granted.

425
00:52:04.528 --> 00:52:08.767
- Come on, move faster.
- Have you noticed the river of lava?

426
00:52:26.607 --> 00:52:28.526
Hold Pinky.

427
00:52:58.925 --> 00:53:00.124
Manny!

428
00:53:12.365 --> 00:53:17.163
Manny, Manny, you OK?
Say something. Anything.

429
00:53:19.164 --> 00:53:21.163
What? I can't hear you.

430
00:53:21.243 --> 00:53:23.563
You're standing on my trunk.

431
00:53:25.083 --> 00:53:28.723
- You're OK.
- Why did you do that?

432
00:53:28.803 --> 00:53:31.442
You could have died, trying to save me.

433
00:53:31.523 --> 00:53:36.482
That's what you do in a herd.
You look out for each other.

434
00:53:36.523 --> 00:53:39.082
Well... thanks.

435
00:53:40.763 --> 00:53:45.322
I don't know about you guys,
but we are the weirdest herd I've ever seen.

436
00:54:02.922 --> 00:54:05.922
I can't wait to get
my claws in that mammoth.

437
00:54:05.962 --> 00:54:10.281
No one touches the mammoth
until I get that baby.

438
00:54:12.362 --> 00:54:15.400
First, I'll slice its hind quarters into sections.

439
00:54:15.481 --> 00:54:19.519
- I'll put the white meat in one pile and...
- Knock it off. I'm starving.

440
00:54:19.562 --> 00:54:23.120
Next, the shoulders.
Occasionally tough, but extremely juicy.

441
00:54:23.201 --> 00:54:26.280
- I told you to knock it off.
- Save your energy.

442
00:54:26.362 --> 00:54:29.240
Mammoths don't go down easy.

443
00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:31.720
There's only one way to do it.

444
00:54:31.801 --> 00:54:34.319
First you have to force it into a corner.

445
00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:38.759
Cut off its retreat.
And when you three have it trapped,

446
00:54:38.841 --> 00:54:40.639
I'll go for the throat.

447
00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:53.318
Guys, we gotta get this kid outta the wind.

448
00:54:57.319 --> 00:54:59.558
- How much further?
- Three miles.

449
00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:01.318
I'm beat.

450
00:55:01.359 --> 00:55:03.919
We'll get there in the morning.

451
00:55:05.879 --> 00:55:09.477
- What are you doin'?
- I'm putting sloths on the map.

452
00:55:12.199 --> 00:55:15.038
Why don't you make it realistic
and draw him lying down?

453
00:55:15.078 --> 00:55:17.317
And make him rounder.

454
00:55:19.679 --> 00:55:23.397
- Perfect.
- Ha-ha... I forgot how to laugh.

455
00:55:30.438 --> 00:55:32.677
I'm a genius.

456
00:55:35.518 --> 00:55:40.836
From now on you'll have to
refer to me as Sid, Lord of the Flame.

457
00:55:40.877 --> 00:55:44.316
Hey, Lord of the Flame.
Your tail's on fire.

458
00:55:52.077 --> 00:55:55.796
Thank you. From now on,
I'm gonna call you Diego...

459
00:55:55.877 --> 00:55:58.156
Lord of Touch Me and You're Dead.

460
00:55:58.237 --> 00:56:01.555
I'm just kiddin', you little knucklehead.

461
00:56:01.637 --> 00:56:03.836
Hey, lovebirds...

462
00:56:03.876 --> 00:56:05.835
Look at this.

463
00:56:09.436 --> 00:56:12.355
I don't believe it.

464
00:56:24.355 --> 00:56:29.314
Come here, you little biped.
Come here, you little wormy-worm.

465
00:56:29.355 --> 00:56:32.354
Come to Uncle Sid.

466
00:56:32.435 --> 00:56:34.514
This way. This way.

467
00:56:35.395 --> 00:56:37.154
No, no. Go to him.

468
00:56:39.074 --> 00:56:40.194
Go to him.

469
00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:44.833
OK...

470
00:56:46.034 --> 00:56:49.953
Good job. Keep practisin'.

471
00:56:52.434 --> 00:56:55.633
Look at that.
Our little guy is growing up.

472
00:56:57.954 --> 00:57:01.272
All right, come on.
Sleep time, lumpy.

473
00:57:05.993 --> 00:57:08.752
Look at that big pushover.

474
00:57:09.514 --> 00:57:13.752
You know, Diego, I've never had
a friend who would risk his life for me.

475
00:57:14.193 --> 00:57:18.272
Yeah, Manny's a good guy.

476
00:57:18.672 --> 00:57:21.231
Yeah, he is.

477
00:57:21.312 --> 00:57:24.111
Well, good night.

478
00:57:54.431 --> 00:57:59.749
Let's get you all cleaned up. What's your
daddy gonna say if you go back all stinky?

479
00:58:00.511 --> 00:58:04.670
Let me just clean that up.
That looks good. A little bit here.

480
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:08.189
- You clean up nice, little fella.
- I think he's starting to look like me.

481
00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:10.669
Diego, what do you think?

482
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:14.269
- Maybe we shouldn't do this.
- Why not?

483
00:58:14.310 --> 00:58:17.949
If we save him, he'll grow up to be a hunter.
And who do you think he'll hunt?

484
00:58:17.989 --> 00:58:20.508
Maybe because we save him,
he won't hunt us.

485
00:58:20.550 --> 00:58:24.948
And maybe he'll grow fur and
a long skinny neck and call you Mama.

486
00:58:25.469 --> 00:58:30.588
- What's your problem?
- Nothing. Let's go. I'm freezing my tail off.

487
00:58:49.188 --> 00:58:51.267
Hey, Diego.
You frozen back there?

488
00:58:55.347 --> 00:58:57.426
- Get down.
- What?

489
00:58:57.469 --> 00:58:59.547
- Get down and follow me.
- What's goin' on?

490
00:58:59.628 --> 00:59:04.427
At the bottom of Half Peak,
there's an ambush waiting for you.

491
00:59:04.507 --> 00:59:07.346
- What?
- What do you mean, ambush?

492
00:59:08.827 --> 00:59:10.906
- You set us up.
- It was my job.

493
00:59:10.947 --> 00:59:14.426
- I was supposed to get the baby, but then...
- You brought us home for dinner.

494
00:59:14.467 --> 00:59:17.186
- That's it. You're out of the herd.
- I'm sorry.

495
00:59:17.266 --> 00:59:19.225
No, you're not. Not yet.

496
00:59:19.306 --> 00:59:22.945
- Listen, I can help you.
- Stay close, Sid. We can fight our way out.

497
00:59:23.026 --> 00:59:26.145
You can't. The pack's too strong.
You have to trust me.

498
00:59:26.227 --> 00:59:28.825
Trust you?
Why in the world would we trust you?

499
00:59:29.507 --> 00:59:31.545
Because I'm your only chance.

500
00:59:44.545 --> 00:59:46.584
Hello, ladies.

501
00:59:47.345 --> 00:59:52.624
- Look who decided to show up.
- Diego, I was beginning to worry about you.

502
00:59:52.665 --> 00:59:58.704
No need to worry. In about two minutes
you'll be satisfying your taste for revenge.

503
00:59:58.745 --> 01:00:00.463
Very nice.

504
01:00:00.505 --> 01:00:03.824
I see the sloth.
And he's got the baby!

505
01:00:03.864 --> 01:00:09.063
Don't give away your positions until you
see the mammoth. He's the one to surprise.

506
01:00:10.064 --> 01:00:12.583
You want to maul something, don't you?

507
01:00:12.664 --> 01:00:16.503
- I wanna maul.
- Then what are you waiting for?

508
01:00:18.983 --> 01:00:22.503
No! I said wait for the mammoth.

509
01:00:42.742 --> 01:00:45.942
Backscratcher.
Eat my powder.

510
01:01:00.342 --> 01:01:01.941
Loop-de-loop.

511
01:01:03.381 --> 01:01:05.661
Slalom! Slalom, baby.

512
01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:34.019
Sorry, fellas.
He got a little frostbite.

513
01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:36.619
Get him!

514
01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:41.859
Surprise!

515
01:01:47.139 --> 01:01:51.579
OK, follow me. We'll pick up Sid
and get outta here while we can.

516
01:01:51.659 --> 01:01:56.218
Come on, Diego.
Let's bring this mammoth down.

517
01:02:07.378 --> 01:02:09.578
There he is.

518
01:02:11.499 --> 01:02:13.858
That's right.
Where's the baby?

519
01:02:17.578 --> 01:02:20.097
Survival of the fittest.

520
01:02:20.818 --> 01:02:23.857
I don't think so. Yeah...

521
01:02:34.097 --> 01:02:38.695
- What are you doing?
- Leave the mammoth alone.

522
01:02:41.418 --> 01:02:44.416
Fine. I'll take you down first.

523
01:03:57.132 --> 01:03:59.211
We did it.

524
01:04:11.413 --> 01:04:13.972
We were some team, huh?

525
01:04:14.692 --> 01:04:18.011
Were? Come on, we're still a team.

526
01:04:18.093 --> 01:04:20.931
I'm sorry I set you up.

527
01:04:20.972 --> 01:04:24.131
You know me -
I'm too lazy to hold a grudge.

528
01:04:27.251 --> 01:04:30.011
Knock it off, squirt.

529
01:04:30.091 --> 01:04:32.171
You gotta be strong.

530
01:04:32.212 --> 01:04:35.690
You have to take care of Manfred and Sid.

531
01:04:36.611 --> 01:04:38.370
Especially Sid.

532
01:04:38.411 --> 01:04:42.370
Come on, you can lick this.
You're a tiger.

533
01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:44.930
Look, I'll carry you.
What do you say?

534
01:04:45.290 --> 01:04:47.729
Come on, Diego.

535
01:04:47.811 --> 01:04:49.929
Tell him he's going to be OK, Manny.

536
01:04:51.370 --> 01:04:54.889
Listen, you have to leave me here.

537
01:04:54.970 --> 01:04:59.009
If those humans get through the pass,
you'll never catch them.

538
01:04:59.611 --> 01:05:02.569
You didn't have to do that.

539
01:05:02.650 --> 01:05:05.328
That's what you do in a herd.

540
01:08:13.001 --> 01:08:16.639
Don't forget about us. OK?

541
01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:22.279
We won't forget about you.

542
01:08:59.879 --> 01:09:01.316
Bye.

543
01:09:02.478 --> 01:09:03.878
Goodbye.

544
01:09:03.958 --> 01:09:05.917
- Goodbye.
- Sid...

545
01:09:05.958 --> 01:09:09.358
Bye. Bye...

546
01:09:13.117 --> 01:09:15.477
That's right. Where's the baby?

547
01:09:15.518 --> 01:09:18.397
Come on, Sid.
Let's head south.

548
01:09:35.196 --> 01:09:37.195
Bye.

549
01:09:38.277 --> 01:09:41.676
Save your breath, Sid.
You know humans can't talk.

550
01:09:42.076 --> 01:09:44.076
Diego? You're OK.

551
01:09:44.156 --> 01:09:45.515
Nine lives, baby.

552
01:09:46.436 --> 01:09:48.355
You're OK.

553
01:09:49.756 --> 01:09:51.995
I could kiss ya.

554
01:09:52.076 --> 01:09:53.675
Yuck!

555
01:09:53.756 --> 01:09:55.835
Welcome back, partner.
Wanna lift?

556
01:09:55.875 --> 01:09:58.714
No thanks. I gotta save
whatever dignity I've got left.

557
01:09:58.795 --> 01:10:02.315
You're hanging out with us.
Dignity's got nothing to do with it.

558
01:10:02.395 --> 01:10:05.715
- But I'll take that lift.
- Climb aboard.

559
01:10:05.755 --> 01:10:10.234
Yee-ha, mush.
Or not mush. Either way.

560
01:10:13.074 --> 01:10:15.674
This is gonna be the best migration ever.

561
01:10:15.755 --> 01:10:18.114
I'll show you all my
favourite watering holes.

562
01:10:18.115 --> 01:10:20.473
I turn brown when the
fungus in my fur dries.

563
01:10:20.555 --> 01:10:24.233
- Sounds very attractive.
- This whole ice age thing is getting old.

564
01:10:24.314 --> 01:10:27.514
You know what I could go for?
Global warming.
