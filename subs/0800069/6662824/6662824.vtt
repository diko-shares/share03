00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.040
No! No! No! No! No!

2
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.350
- No! No!
- Die!

3
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.530
<i>Colonel Redding.</i>
<i>Now there's a piece of work.</i>

4
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.200
<i>I can't believe he's having us</i>
<i>wire up this hellhole.</i>

5
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.180
<i>He's obsessed with something.</i>
<i>What's he expecting to find down there?</i>

6
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.540
Ghosts of old miners?

7
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.710
They're here!
Hey.

8
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.080
You ready to test 'em?

9
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.090
All right. You got everybody?

10
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.060
Number one's dead.

11
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.290
Oh.

12
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.090
How about now?

13
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.730
- <i>Whoa. Good there.</i>
- <i>How about the security dummies?</i>

14
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.040
They're dead too.

15
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.400
Hold on.

16
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.840
<i>What the hell?</i>

17
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.540
<i>What you got?</i>

18
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.820
- I got a shitload of false readings. Stand by.
- <i>Again?</i>

19
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.820
- <i>What's going on in here?</i>
- <i>Damn it!</i>

20
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.920
- We just lost our feed.
- I'll go check the main junction.

21
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.830
<i>Spooky down there, isn't it?</i>

22
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.070
<i>We were the first ones</i>
<i>in there since the '50s.</i>

23
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.800
<i>Maybe it is haunted.</i>
<i>Glad it's you and not me in there.</i>

24
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.480
Aw, fuck!

25
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.110
- <i>What's with the junction box?</i>
- It's history.

26
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.710
Our friends the rats again.

27
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.050
They love the taste
of the insulation.

28
00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.560
All right, I'll call base. Should be able
to get a backup here in an hour or so. Shit.

29
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.890
Dr. Wilson,
have you seen Foster?

30
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.490
Calibrating the infrared sensor
up top the mountain.

31
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.470
- Dumb sons of bitches.
- Sorry, Colonel Redding.

32
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.740
<i>Guys aren't supposed to be here</i>
<i>without a goddamn escort!</i>

33
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.980
Wilson.

34
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.860
Wilson?

35
00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.450
<i>Wilson, come in.</i>

36
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.170
<i>Where are these guys?</i>

37
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.500
<i>Han, do you read me? It's Foster.</i>

38
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.570
<i>Han, come in.</i>

39
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.040
<i>Han, it's Foster.</i>

40
00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.910
Hi.

41
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.560
Are you... lost?

42
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.730
My name is Dr. Foster.
Uh-

43
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.960
Do you- Do you have a name?

44
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.440
- "Roonawee."
- "Roonawee"?

45
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.140
- Run away!
- Run away?

46
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.440
Foster?

47
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.320
Foster!

48
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.800
<i>Now, where are you?</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

49
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.700
Come out of your holes.

50
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.430
Come on, you cocksucker
motherfucker sons of bitches!

51
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.110
Foster!

52
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.990
- Go! Go! Move out! Move out! Go!
- Keep moving! Keep mov-

53
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.360
<i>Go!</i>

54
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.400
- Oh, shit!
- Take cover!

55
00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.990
<i>Come on, Crank!</i>

56
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:58.530
- Whoa!
- Ow!

57
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.510
- Leave it!
- I gotta get my helmet.

58
00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.240
<i>Spitter, forget your fucking helmet!</i>
<i>Get back here!</i>

59
00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.740
- It's not supposed to be this bad!
- Die!

60
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:13.310
- <i>America's mothers suck cock!</i>
- What the fuck did you say?

61
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.550
- <i>Your American mothers suck cock!</i>
- <i>Uh, Crank?</i>

62
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.180
<i>Fuck you!</i>
<i>America number one, bitch!</i>

63
00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.750
<i>Crank, no! No!</i>

64
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.300
- Crank!
- Let's move, pussies!

65
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:30.700
Crank, you dumb motherfucker!
Don't freak out!

66
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.800
- <i>I know what to do. Get out of the way.</i>
- <i>Give him some cover!</i>

67
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.970
- I got this. I got this.
- <i>You get out!</i>

68
00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:42.780
- <i>This is fortress of Allah!</i>
- Napoleon, get the door.

69
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:44.780
- <i>What?</i>
- Get the door, man!

70
00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:47.820
- I can't hear you!
- Get the fuckin' door!
- Fuck!

71
00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:50.580
- <i>This is the mother of all doors!</i>
- <i>Fall back!</i>

72
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.990
- Shit! Take cover!
- Run!

73
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.890
Shit!

74
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.890
Mama!

75
00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:06.600
<i>You killed my babies!</i>

76
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.470
- You killed my babies! You killed my babies!
- <i>Watch out.</i>

77
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.740
- <i>Watch her.</i>
- We didn't mean to.

78
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:18.180
- No! Napoleon!
- Kaboom!

79
00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:21.310
Oh, you're dead.

80
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:23.360
Idiot!

81
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:28.920
A stunning display of
individual and group stupidity.

82
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.990
Seventeen civilians killed,
and yourselves.

83
00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:35.660
I'm in fucking awe!

84
00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:39.830
Cole! Never leave cover
to retrieve your helmet!

85
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.700
You won't have a head
to put it on anyway.

86
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:46.340
<i>Johnson, do not drop your weapon</i>
<i>to protect your ears.</i>

87
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.640
You are better off
deaf than dead.

88
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.010
Medina, since you are not
Rambo resurrected...

89
00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:54.880
do not charge while
your head is securely up your ass.

90
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.550
That's how innocent people get killed.
And you, Napoleon.

91
00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:02.990
- It's Napoli, Sarge.
- You're quite the killer, aren't you, Napoleon?

92
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.690
Almost got your whole squad
blown to hell in six seconds.

93
00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:08.890
<i>That's a mighty impressive body count</i>
<i>for somebody who's against the war.</i>

94
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.960
- What?
- Oh, yeah. Your brother didn't tell you?

95
00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.230
Pretty mouth here's
got himself a bumper sticker.

96
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:17.800
It says,
"Conversation, not confrontation."

97
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.400
- What's up with that shit?
- You against the war, Doonesbury?

98
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.710
Not all wars, Sarge. I just think
that the president lies too much.

99
00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.910
All presidents lie, asshole!
That's their fucking job.

100
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:31.980
- Yes, sir.
- No president has told the truth since Truman.

101
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.080
- And do you know what he said?
- No, Sarge.

102
00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.030
He said that
the buck stops <i>here</i>!

103
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.030
Now, you have all
failed combat...

104
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.040
and are therefore
officially dead.

105
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.500
Congratu-fucking-lations.

106
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.010
Fall in at that deuce and a half
with all gear.

107
00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:50.700
<i>We will deploy to the</i>
<i>Agave Ridge rifle range.</i>

108
00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.540
There, you can complete your
failure of these exercises...

109
00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:56.640
by blowin' each other's
dead heads off!

110
00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.620
And on our way,
we're stopping at Sector 16...

111
00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:02.590
to deliver equipment to scientists
who are working there.

112
00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:07.360
This is a top secret area,
so do not wander off or talk to anybody.

113
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:11.190
Now, get your sorry rookie butts
in the back of that truck, now!

114
00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.200
Let's go! Let's go!

115
00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:17.070
Let's go, Spitter! If I had some steak
on a string, you'd move real fast!

116
00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.720
Jesus!
How big is this place?

117
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.390
It's about 1,300 square miles.
They used to test nuclear weapons here.

118
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:52.910
Well, isn't it radioactive then?

119
00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:56.600
- Not according to the army.
- Fuck.

120
00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.240
<i>Maybe I should thank Napoleon.</i>

121
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:03.750
<i>If we're all officially dead</i>
<i>like Sarge said...</i>

122
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.550
<i>I won't be tried</i>
<i>for war crimes.</i>

123
00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.650
The killing of innocent mannequins
is serious shit.

124
00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.250
- Where I come from, it's never good to be dead.
- <i>Aw, Crank.</i>

125
00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.760
You're takin' all the fun
out of the afterlife.

126
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.350
Shove the afterlife up your ass.

127
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:20.590
- <i>That's cold, man.</i>
- Clyde, huh?

128
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:24.970
Made the same mistake when I was a kid.
So is Clyde still your dude?

129
00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.840
Uh, yeah, Stump.
Clyde's still my dude.

130
00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.270
Stump, that's her son.
He's, like, four years old.

131
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.970
That is so fucked up.

132
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:38.810
<i>One good thing</i>
<i>about being dead-</i>

133
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:40.820
Wouldn't have to listen
to all your bullshit.

134
00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:44.650
- Oh.
- That's all there is out here.
Just a bunch of bullshit.

135
00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.660
This bullshit's
got a crazy past.

136
00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:49.750
You guys know they used to use this
as a test ground for A-bombs?

137
00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:52.860
<i>You guys know</i>
<i>this used to be a test ground for A-bombs?</i>

138
00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:56.060
- Who the fuck asked you, peace-ass shit boy?
- <i>Oh, right.</i>

139
00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.230
I'm sorry. I forgot I was
dealing with Rambo resurrected.

140
00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:02.500
You Rambo resurrect my balls, bitch.

141
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:07.240
You with the-

142
00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:09.870
- <i>Whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>
- <i>Come on, Crank!</i>

143
00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.420
- You wanna die young, <i>cabrón</i>?
- <i>You guys, stop!</i>

144
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:15.010
- I'll kill you right now!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Crank!

145
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:23.050
I killed somebody once.

146
00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:26.530
It was easy.
That's why it's so dangerous.

147
00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:34.910
I don't fuckin'
like that guy.

148
00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:38.170
Well, I don't like bein' out here havin'
to put up with you, but I deal with it.

149
00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.110
<i>So deal with it.</i>

150
00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:49.280
- Thanks.
- <i>Don't mind Crank.</i>

151
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.020
He's just
a cranky motherfucker.

152
00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:41.460
- They're so top secret, they're invisible, huh?
- <i>You got that right.</i>

153
00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.920
Hello!

154
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.650
- Oh, leg's asleep.
- Dick's asleep.

155
00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:06.320
- You wanna wake it up?
- Nah, that's your daddy's job.

156
00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.330
Hey, you two, cut the bullshit.

157
00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.500
Off-load that crate.
Put it in the tent. Spitter, get me base.

158
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:14.970
National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner
calling Yuma Flats Base. Over.

159
00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.670
<i>National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner</i>
<i>calling Yuma Flats Base.</i>

160
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.540
Over.

161
00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.670
- Nothing, sir. It's the hills.
- <i>Keep trying.</i>

162
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:34.660
<i>National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner</i>
<i>to Yuma Flats Base. Over.</i>

163
00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:40.070
Hello?

164
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.670
- Private Crackhead.
- Sarge?

165
00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:46.830
See if you can find Colonel Redding.
He's supposed to be the security over here.

166
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:52.540
See these cables? They run into that old bunker
over there. Check it out. Watch your step.

167
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:54.910
- Yes, sir, Sergeant.
- Private Mickey Mouse.

168
00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:58.780
See if you can find some gas. There's gotta
be some cans around here somewhere.

169
00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.980
Yes, Sergeant.

170
00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:07.860
Napoleon,
where the fuck are you goin'?

171
00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:10.400
- I was just gonna use the facility.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

172
00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:14.190
You are in mountain assault training.
There are no port-a-potties in Kandahar.

173
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:17.500
You will take your dumps
behind the cactus with the scorpions.

174
00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:20.060
- Do you understand me?
- What do I use for T.P., sir?

175
00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.940
Use your fuckin' hand.

176
00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:24.940
Yes, Sarge.

177
00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.090
<i>Yo!</i>

178
00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:14.620
Colonel Redding?

179
00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:21.520
Stupid bats!

180
00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:27.900
No gas, sir,
but I found this.

181
00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:31.770
Satellite phone.
Must've been how they contacted base.

182
00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.110
- <i>I don't think it's working.</i>
- Man, somebody's got a temper.

183
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.840
Mine's all buttoned up, Sarge.
Nobody's home.

184
00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.440
Whose radio's that?

185
00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:45.920
- Must be one of theirs.
- <i>Wilson? Han? You there?</i>

186
00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.960
- Hello?
- Who the fuck is this?

187
00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:56.470
This is Sergeant Jeffrey Millstone
of the U.S. National Guard.

188
00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.600
<i>Who is this,</i>
<i>and what's your position?</i>

189
00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:01.270
<i>I need help.</i>

190
00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.200
<i>I'm up the hill.</i>

191
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.940
<i>Are you in distress?</i>

192
00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:10.980
Fuck! Spitter, what's
the range on these things?

193
00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:13.020
Couple miles.
Line of sight.

194
00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:16.610
- Sarge.
- Looks like a signal mirror.

195
00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:19.660
<i>It's gotta be him.</i>

196
00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:23.130
- We're on a search and rescue mission.
- That's right, we are!

197
00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.130
Shut the fuck up!

198
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.530
I said search and rescue,
not fuckin' spring break.

199
00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.540
I want you back here with weapons
and gear for a climbing assault in five.

200
00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:36.170
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir, Sarge.

201
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.080
No disrespect, but do you
really think it's a good idea...

202
00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:41.080
goin' up there without
contacting headquarters?

203
00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:44.410
Do you like
fucking with me, Napoleon?

204
00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.380
I think you do.
You know what?

205
00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:49.150
You're officially in charge
of guarding the latrine.

206
00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.090
Not using it,
but guarding it.

207
00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.180
I want you to stand on one leg
and hold your rifle over your fucking head...

208
00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.860
and make sure that no one
steals or molests that port-a-potty...

209
00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:00.960
or I will have your Gomer Pyle ass
court-martialed immediately.

210
00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:03.830
Do you understand what I'm saying
to you? Do you understand me?

211
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.130
Yeah, I'll go.
I just think that it's a bad idea.

212
00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:09.170
- Get over there and guard
that fuckin' latrine, now!
- Sir, yes, sir!

213
00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:14.940
- Live ammo or blanks?
- One live mag each weapon. It's heavier.

214
00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:19.540
Flashlights and hydration packs too.
The more weight, the better for you clowns.

215
00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:23.210
<i>You're halfway through your training,</i>
<i>and you look like a bunch of raw recruits.</i>

216
00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:27.230
<i>You're a disgrace to the U.S. National Guard,</i>
<i>and you wouldn't last five minutes in combat.</i>

217
00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:30.630
One leg, Gomer Pyle!

218
00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.960
<i>The rest of you,</i>
<i>get your asses up that hill.</i>

219
00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:37.370
<i>And wipe those silly smiles</i>
<i>off your faces now!</i>

220
00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.970
Let's move!
One leg, Pyle!

221
00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:48.140
<i>One leg!</i>

222
00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.650
- You're so bad.
- Company, halt! Johnson!

223
00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.740
- Sir?
- You stay here.

224
00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.260
<i>Spitter's coming with us. Get on</i>
<i>the main radio and try to raise somebody.</i>

225
00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.560
If you can get through to a medevac,
the guy'll have a hell of a better chance.

226
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:06.060
- Now, move.
- Yes, Sarge.

227
00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:08.070
Don't forget to write.

228
00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:13.500
Get goin'! Turn around!
One leg!

229
00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.500
<i>One leg, Gomer Pyle!</i>

230
00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.730
<i>Mayday. Mayday. This is</i>
<i>the National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner...</i>

231
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.270
calling the Yuma Flats Base
requesting a medevac.

232
00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.600
Over.

233
00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:52.010
Hello?

234
00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:57.040
<i>Shit.</i>

235
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.720
Mayday. Mayday. This is
the National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner...

236
00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:06.260
calling the Yuma Flats Base
requesting a medevac.

237
00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:08.190
Over.

238
00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.850
What the hell are scientists
doing way the hell out here?

239
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.860
There's nothing but
rocks and rattlesnakes.

240
00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:15.900
Army business, dumb ass,
and definitely none of your business.

241
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:18.130
But, Sarge,
I am in the army.

242
00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.800
Which gives you the right
to shut the fuck up!

243
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:23.210
Okay. I'll just
shut the fuck up then.

244
00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.210
How many people
are supposed to be here?

245
00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.010
I have no idea.
Maybe we can ask him up there.

246
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.480
<i>What are we supposed</i>
<i>to do when we find this dude?</i>

247
00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:32.480
Well, it depends
on how bad he is.

248
00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:34.990
We wait for a medevac,
or we'll hump him down by hand.

249
00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:38.820
I know I'm not supposed to talk,
Sarge, but I hope-

250
00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:41.720
<i>Shit, man!</i>

251
00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.990
Come on, pull!
I got you, Mickey!

252
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:51.830
<i>Hello?</i>

253
00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.840
- Shit.
- <i>You saved my life, Sarge.</i>

254
00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:56.640
Yeah, well, nobody's perfect.

255
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:58.640
<i>How far down does that thing go?</i>

256
00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:01.300
<i>China?</i>

257
00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:07.680
Could be a hundred feet deep
or a hundred years old.

258
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:10.520
Just waitin' to suck
your ass in.

259
00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:14.360
So keep your eyes open.
There's a lot of old mines around here.

260
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:17.190
- How's your ankle, Mickey?
- I'm fine, I'm fine. Let's go.

261
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:23.690
- We cannot afford to slow down.
- Come on, Sarge. Let's go.

262
00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:27.540
- Ow!
- Head back to base camp.

263
00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:30.730
- Oh, come on, Sarge.
- Mick, back to camp.

264
00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:34.250
Now.
That's an order.

265
00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.880
What the fuck is everybody
lookin' at? Let's keep movin'!

266
00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:56.130
Screw it.

267
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:05.570
- Hey! You're not supposed to do that.
- Duty calls.

268
00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:10.810
Mayday. Mayday. This is
the National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner...

269
00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.220
<i>calling the Yuma Flats Base</i>
<i>requesting a medevac.</i>

270
00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:16.220
Over.

271
00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:18.780
<i>Mayday. Mayday.</i>

272
00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:22.260
<i>This is the National Guard Yankee-Five-Niner</i>
<i>calling the Yuma Flats Base-</i>

273
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.520
- Oh, fuck! Fuck!
- What?

274
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:56.580
- There's a hand in the shitter!
- What?

275
00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:01.120
Check it out!
Oh, fuckin'-

276
00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:10.040
Oh!

277
00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:12.440
There's nobody in there.

278
00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:15.110
Down... there.

279
00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:35.860
- Who was that guy?
- Shit-Man the Barbarian! I have no idea!

280
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:38.130
Help me!

281
00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:45.040
- Oh, man.
- <i>Oh, God!</i>

282
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:50.710
<i>I can't tell one rock from another.</i>

283
00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:54.910
It was between those three.

284
00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:59.690
Seems like that's
the only way up right there.

285
00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.750
- That ain't so bad.
- Nah, man.

286
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:03.920
Not so bad at all...

287
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.900
if you're
a fuckin' squirrel.

288
00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:20.510
- What's with all these cuts?
- I don't know.

289
00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:31.720
Who did this to you?

290
00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.890
They're... here.

291
00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:41.770
Who's they?

292
00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.470
None of the cuts
were that deep.

293
00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:56.880
- Massive infection.
- What?

294
00:25:56.950 --> 00:26:00.750
Shit stinks because it's full of pathogens.

295
00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:04.810
Whoever did this to him
wanted him to die slowly.

296
00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:06.980
What kind of person
could do that to someone?

297
00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.720
I honestly don't know.

298
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.230
Let's go, Delmar.

299
00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:21.330
<i>There you go.</i>

300
00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:27.130
<i>Pick your spots.</i>

301
00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:31.980
Find the creases.

302
00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.410
<i>You got it.</i>
<i>You got it!</i>

303
00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:44.390
- Ow!
- <i>Keep goin', soldier.</i>

304
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:49.930
There you go. That's what
I'm talkin' about, Delmar.

305
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.370
- <i>Whoo! Nice!</i>
- <i>All right. All right!</i>

306
00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:00.940
- <i>All right!</i>
- <i>Yeah! Spider-Man!</i>

307
00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:03.280
You are officially
a bad motherfucker.

308
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:07.810
<i>Stump, you're up next.</i>
<i>The rest of you, get your asses ready.</i>

309
00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.030
Love you, Mommy.

310
00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:39.480
<i>Take your time and pick your spots, Stump.</i>

311
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.850
Asshole!

312
00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.890
Oh, easy.
Sarge says we're moving out.

313
00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.890
Well, make some noise
next time you come up behind me!

314
00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:52.830
Yeah, whatever.
Look, I'm just the messenger.

315
00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.720
<i>Chicks, man.</i>

316
00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.580
Hello? Hello?

317
00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:12.110
<i>Over. Hello?</i>
<i>Hello? Over.</i>

318
00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:18.090
- <i>Hello? Hello? Over.</i>
- You get through to 'em?

319
00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.350
This radio sucks!

320
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.560
Hello? Sarge?
Anybody?

321
00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.900
Holy shit!

322
00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:37.570
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no, no, no!

323
00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:41.130
- No!
- Oh, my God!

324
00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.580
- Shit!
- What are you doin'?

325
00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:49.620
- Fuck!
- What?

326
00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:52.380
Where's your rifle?

327
00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:56.650
<i>Oh, God, it's gone!</i>

328
00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.290
Oh, God!

329
00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:06.660
- Let's just get up there.
- No, no, no, no, no. We're not goin' up that hill.

330
00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.300
I'm not hiding down here
waiting for them to come down!

331
00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:11.740
What? You scared?

332
00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:16.410
It's not about being scared. It's about not
making idiotic and possibly fatal decisions.

333
00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.920
Right. I forgot
who I was speaking to.

334
00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:22.080
The same genius
who got his whole squad blown to hell.

335
00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:27.490
Didn't you hear what he said?
Someone is here. You wanna die like him?

336
00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.820
Let's just get up
with the others.

337
00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:38.860
Hello, Sarge?
Hello, Sarge?

338
00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.170
<i>Hello? Sarge?</i>
<i>Anyone?</i>

339
00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:51.050
Can anybody out there read me?

340
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:31.920
Napoleon!

341
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:36.020
- What?
- I don't know-

342
00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:41.030
Amber!

343
00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.590
Hey!

344
00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:52.610
Hey!

345
00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:00.250
Napoleon!

346
00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:11.960
Did I hit him?

347
00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:18.960
Mickey! Mickey!

348
00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:24.300
- Hey, who was that?
- Mickey, something's going on!
Oh, God. Are you all right?

349
00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:27.870
Yeah, I just twisted my ankle-

350
00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:30.310
Hold on!

351
00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:34.550
Holy shit! Fuck!

352
00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:37.880
Hold on! Hold on!
I got you!

353
00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.950
Oh, shit! Oh, God!

354
00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.960
- Shit!
- Hold on! I got you!

355
00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:45.620
Shoot the fucker! Shoot him!

356
00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:48.830
- <i>Shoot him!</i>
- I can't see in there!

357
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:54.400
I don't have a shot!

358
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:57.170
Fucking help me, man!

359
00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:05.310
<i>Don't let go! Mickey!</i>

360
00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:09.820
Oh, God!
Oh!

361
00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:14.990
Mickey!

362
00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:23.460
- <i>Oh, God!</i>
- Mickey!

363
00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:27.460
Man, this is some bullshit.

364
00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:40.010
- What?
- Thought I heard something.

365
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.520
- <i>A shot.</i>
- <i>This is a military base.</i>

366
00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:45.110
People are shootin'
all over the place.

367
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:49.180
I think it came from camp. Has anybody
checked in with Amber recently?

368
00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:52.390
Mickey's down there by now.
You know he's got her in a tent...

369
00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.760
and they're doin'
a whole nother kind of training.

370
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:56.860
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

371
00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:59.030
- <i>Sarge, up there!</i>
- <i>I see it!</i>

372
00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:03.160
- Another one.
- You two, get your asses up here!

373
00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.330
Come on.

374
00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:07.900
<i>Hello!</i>

375
00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:13.110
Hello!

376
00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.690
Oh, no.

377
00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:28.000
The red and black high-top forces.
What?

378
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:32.260
- And it's my size too?
- What the fuck's it doing way up here?

379
00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:34.930
Now, if we could only find
the other ones, we'd be in business.

380
00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:38.030
<i>Sarge, over here!</i>

381
00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:42.280
<i>Sarge!</i>

382
00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:53.410
<i>What the fuck is in his head?</i>

383
00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.220
- Private Crackhead, fish it out.
- <i>Huh?</i>

384
00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:58.920
<i>Shit.</i>

385
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:12.260
"Dr. Paul Foster.
Department of Defense."

386
00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:16.280
Looks like we found
one of our scientists.

387
00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:20.480
- Lock and load.
- This isn't supposed to happen
on an army base, man.

388
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:23.250
- In the middle of a U.S. military facility.
- <i>The size of Rhode Island.</i>

389
00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:26.780
Look, if some asshole wants to go nuts,
this is a damn good place to do it.

390
00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:29.120
<i>Spitter, get Amber on the radio.</i>

391
00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:34.290
Stark Nine. Stark Nine. Amber,
this is Spitter. You read me? Over.

392
00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:40.900
Stark Nine. Stark Nine.
Amber, this is Spitter. You read me? Over.

393
00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.070
There's too much interference.

394
00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:51.480
- <i>Sarge, we should go back down-</i>
- Amber's fine. She's got Mick and Napoleon.

395
00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:53.540
- <i>Help me.</i>
- That their radio?

396
00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:57.320
Let me have it.
Colonel Redding, is this you?

397
00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:02.990
Hello?
Can you hear me?

398
00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:09.700
<i>That wasn't</i>
<i>the same voice as before.</i>

399
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:13.130
<i>Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't.</i>
<i>But if somebody's hurt, we're gonna help him.</i>

400
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.600
<i>And if somebody is fucking with us,</i>
<i>we're gonna find out who it is.</i>

401
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:18.670
- Sarge-
- I told you before, this isn't spring break.

402
00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:21.510
One way or the other,
lives are at stake.

403
00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:24.710
That's how it is.

404
00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:26.720
<i>Crank, Spitter,</i>
<i>you stay with me on lead.</i>

405
00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:30.150
Missy, Stump, Delmar,
you bring up the rear. Watch our backs.

406
00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:33.880
Stay alert and stay alive.
Let's move.

407
00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.770
You hear somethin'?

408
00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:30.870
I don't know.
Maybe a bird?

409
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:33.420
- Keep your eyes open.
- Okay.

410
00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.220
What the fuck was that?

411
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:51.200
Aw, shit!

412
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:54.710
- What the fuck-
- No!

413
00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:57.800
<i>Sarge!</i>

414
00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:01.810
- Spitter! Fuck!
- Oh, fuck, man! Sarge!

415
00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.580
That was Spit, man.

416
00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:06.620
<i>Sarge!</i>

417
00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.650
- Sarge!
- <i>I didn't mean to do that!</i>

418
00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:11.380
<i>Sarge!</i>

419
00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:16.060
You hurt? You hurt?

420
00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:18.100
- I didn't mean to do that.
- Do what?

421
00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:21.260
Sarge!
Sarge! Sarge!

422
00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:23.300
Sarge!

423
00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:25.930
- What do we do?
- Go get me the medi-pack.

424
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.770
Medi-pack? D!
Medi-pack! Bring it over here!

425
00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:39.780
Fuck, man! Fuck.

426
00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:44.120
- What happened?
- I swear, man, this dude
just popped out of nowhere.

427
00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:46.350
- <i>He stabbed Spit in the back.</i>
- Hey, man.

428
00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:48.450
<i>I didn't mean to.</i>
<i>Fuck, man.</i>

429
00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:51.520
- <i>Is he okay? Is he okay?</i>
- Sarge?

430
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.760
Sarge?
Come on, breathe.

431
00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:59.030
Breathe, Sarge.

432
00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:01.300
Sarge, stay with us.

433
00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:03.310
- <i>Sarge!</i>
- What do we need?

434
00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:05.310
What do you need?

435
00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:07.470
<i>Crank!</i>

436
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:09.480
Missy,
what do you need?

437
00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:12.640
<i>Crank! Crank!</i>
<i>Tell them, man! Tell them!</i>

438
00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:16.020
<i>It was an accident.</i>
<i>It was a fucking accident.</i>

439
00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:22.890
They're fucking with us.
These guys are smart.

440
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:34.860
<i>Amber?</i>
<i>Where's Mickey?</i>

441
00:38:56.790 --> 00:39:00.090
Watch between the rocks.
Under your feet too.

442
00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.890
- That's how they got Mickey?
- That's how they did it.

443
00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:04.960
God.

444
00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:11.810
What is it?

445
00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:16.010
<i>What do you see, Delmar?</i>

446
00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:19.170
It's nothin'.
We're almost there.

447
00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:35.460
All right, guys.
Let's rig a line and get Sarge down.

448
00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:39.730
- I'm going down with him.
- Sorry, Spit. I don't know how
to rig for a two-man.

449
00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.740
- <i>Yeah, me either, man.</i>
- I can do it.

450
00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:47.800
All right. All right.
Let's make it happen.

451
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:55.420
- You need two, right?
- Yeah.

452
00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:58.220
<i>Oh, and a couple</i>
<i>of those carabiners.</i>

453
00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:03.590
<i>Prop him up.</i>

454
00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:06.060
Yo, prop him up.

455
00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:09.100
- You sure you know what you're doing?
- Double bowline.

456
00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:11.160
- <i>Right knot for the job.</i>
- You sure about that?

457
00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:15.300
- I was an Eagle Scout.
- It better fuckin' hold.

458
00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:17.570
Come on, Spit.
Let's do it.

459
00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:29.610
You ready?
All right.

460
00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:36.590
I'm sorry, Spitter.
It's the only way.

461
00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:40.290
If he's loose, he'll fall out of his harness.
Okay?

462
00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:42.300
Mm-hmm.

463
00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:45.130
Okay.

464
00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:49.370
- <i>See you down there,</i> cabrón<i>.</i>
- Okay, man.

465
00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:52.170
Okay?

466
00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:55.040
Easy. Easy.

467
00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:58.050
<i>Okay.</i>

468
00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:00.310
<i>You got it, Spitter.</i>

469
00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:02.320
All right, man.
Plant your feet.

470
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:04.450
Take it easy.

471
00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:06.620
<i>Right there, Spitter.</i>
<i>You got it. Plant your feet, man.</i>

472
00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:08.750
- You're doin' good, Spitter.
- <i>Little more. Little more.</i>

473
00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:10.320
Right there.

474
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:13.360
<i>Napoleon, get your thumb</i>
<i>out of your ass and help us out!</i>

475
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:15.300
- <i>You comfortable?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

476
00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:18.490
<i>You're looking good, man.</i>
<i>Keep it right there.</i>

477
00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:20.700
- All right, slow down. I'm about to lose visual.
- <i>Slow down a little.</i>

478
00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:24.070
<i>Keep it slow, Spitter.</i>

479
00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:26.080
<i>Yo, slow down.</i>
<i>Slow down.</i>

480
00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:31.050
<i>Spitter! Spitter! Spit-</i>

481
00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:34.850
- Spitter!
- What happened?

482
00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.390
<i>What- What happened?</i>

483
00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:40.250
- <i>What happened?</i>
- He's fuckin' dead, man.

484
00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:43.380
- What the fuck happened?
- <i>He's fuckin' dead.</i>

485
00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:53.330
Your fuckin' knot didn't hold,
you lying faggot!

486
00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:56.170
- <i>The rope must've broke.</i>
- The rope didn't break.

487
00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:58.170
- <i>Exactly.</i>
- It was cut.

488
00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:05.240
Oh, man, we're gettin' picked off
one by one here.

489
00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:07.010
You motherfuckers!

490
00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:10.050
You motherfuckers are dead!

491
00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:12.280
<i>You hear me?</i>

492
00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:15.550
Dead!

493
00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:17.590
Aw, shit!

494
00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:19.750
Where are the ropes?

495
00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:23.730
- <i>Hey, who's got the rest of the ropes?</i>
- I put 'em up there.

496
00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.630
They're gone.
They're not here.

497
00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:29.370
We can't get down
without the ropes.

498
00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:32.970
<i>Who the hell is doing all of</i>
<i>this fuckin' bullshit to us?</i>

499
00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:36.210
<i>Whoever these fuckers are,</i>
<i>they want us dead.</i>

500
00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:40.110
<i>No, that's where they want us-</i>
<i>thinkin' we got no chance.</i>

501
00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:42.950
We're gonna get out
of this together.

502
00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:45.080
Let's think about that.

503
00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:46.990
- How do we get down?
- <i>There's gotta be a way.</i>

504
00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:49.460
They got up here.
We'll take the same way down.

505
00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:03.940
<i>Watch your step. It's a long way down.</i>

506
00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:13.070
Damn!

507
00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:32.100
<i>You're not gonna like this.</i>

508
00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:35.000
What?

509
00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:37.600
Oh, fuck, man!

510
00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:40.340
Another dead end!

511
00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:43.310
No way we're gettin' down
without ropes. I told you!

512
00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:45.310
We go back and find another way.

513
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:49.920
Oh, shit!

514
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:52.320
D., why the fuck are we
moving towards the weird noises?

515
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:54.320
- <i>Just shut the hell up!</i>
- <i>You shut the hell up!</i>

516
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:56.380
<i>This is bullshit!</i>

517
00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:02.230
- D...!
- Shh!

518
00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.870
Holy shit.

519
00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:14.180
- Go ahead and shoot.
- Let's get some first aid.

520
00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:16.340
- Coming up.
- Napoleon, watch our backs.

521
00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:19.470
- <i>Got it.</i>
- <i>Colonel Redding.</i>

522
00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:22.380
Just hang on, sir, okay?
We're gonna get you out of here.

523
00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:26.010
Where's your C.O.?
Where's your commanding officer?

524
00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:28.520
We lost him.

525
00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:32.390
- Better let me see those wounds, sir.
- You don't have a fucking clue!

526
00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:38.700
Shit!

527
00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:45.100
Sir, if you know something
we should know, now's the time.

528
00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:49.740
<i>I just needed a little proof.</i>

529
00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:52.080
- Proof of what?
- What's going on here, Colonel?

530
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:55.680
It's not the fucks
in caves...

531
00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:58.720
halfway around the world
that keep me up at night.

532
00:44:58.790 --> 00:45:00.450
<i>Mm-mmm.</i>

533
00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:04.590
They're right here in the middle
of our own goddamn base.

534
00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:06.790
<i>People still living</i>
<i>in the mines.</i>

535
00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:10.130
<i>They thought they got rid of them,</i>
<i>but I knew they didn't.</i>

536
00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:13.400
- You knew about these fuckers?
- One or two more nights...

537
00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:17.430
I-I-I-I could've had 'em
blown back to the Stone Age.

538
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:21.380
Tell us what to do, Colonel.
How do we get out of here?

539
00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:23.380
<i>That's a good fuckin' question, isn't it?</i>

540
00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:27.650
You could-You could
go down through the mines...

541
00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:30.550
<i>except they'd kill you</i>
<i>for sure.</i>

542
00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:33.090
All except the girls.

543
00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:36.320
You ladies, they'll keep you alive
for breeding...

544
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:38.830
<i>and trying to get</i>
<i>their numbers back up.</i>

545
00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:40.830
What?

546
00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:44.990
Yeah, whatever, asshole.
How do we get down this hill?

547
00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:48.630
Simple.

548
00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:58.010
What the fuck?
What the fuck was that, man?

549
00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:36.850
I don't know how much more
of this I can take.

550
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:42.720
- I'm so fucking scared.
- We're gonna get through this.

551
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:44.780
<i>We're gonna make it</i>
<i>out of here, okay?</i>

552
00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:46.830
You think?

553
00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:50.860
Have to.
I'm the only real family Clyde's got.

554
00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:53.530
Give anything just to
smell his hair again.

555
00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:57.040
You never talk about him.

556
00:46:58.710 --> 00:47:03.150
Work's work. Family is-
I don't know- sacred.

557
00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:05.340
I always tried
keeping the two separate.

558
00:47:07.690 --> 00:47:10.090
I guess that's all bullshit now.

559
00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:20.020
He's beautiful.

560
00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:22.590
Now!

561
00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:33.110
<i>Yeah!</i>

562
00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:36.040
<i>Biatch!</i>

563
00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:41.610
<i>Is he dead?</i>

564
00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:43.590
Fuckin'-A!

565
00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:46.180
Got him.

566
00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:49.380
- You all right?
- Mm-hmm.

567
00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:52.760
That's the piece of shit
that jumped me back at camp.

568
00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:55.890
<i>I think he killed Mickey too.</i>

569
00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:03.200
Damn.
He's fuckin' ugly.

570
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:06.900
- <i>Fuckin' stinks.</i>
- He's fucking big, man.

571
00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:10.540
Still, nothing a little
hot lead can't fix.

572
00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:14.280
<i>Hot lead?</i>
<i>Listen to you, man.</i>

573
00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:17.250
Yeah, well, it's just one.
How many are left?

574
00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:19.290
Hey, bring 'em on, man.

575
00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:23.290
Hey.
You guys did good.

576
00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:25.620
- Thanks.
- Smells like shit.

577
00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:28.820
<i>Yeah! We got this.</i>

578
00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:57.990
Where's Missy?

579
00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:00.000
<i>Hey, Missy?</i>

580
00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:02.830
- Shit!
- It's Missy!

581
00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:05.100
There!

582
00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:09.540
Watch yourselves.

583
00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:21.020
<i>Missy!</i>

584
00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:23.850
Missy!

585
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:33.690
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on.
Delmar, you heard what that dude said.

586
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:35.700
We should climb down, man.

587
00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:38.890
- <i>What are you talkin' about?</i>
- <i>I'm talkin' about you and me.</i>

588
00:49:38.970 --> 00:49:42.740
We don't need ropes. We can
make it down freestyle no sweat, man.

589
00:49:42.810 --> 00:49:44.710
- Let's just do it.
- What about the rest of us?

590
00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:47.570
- What about Missy?
- We can get down fast, and you know it.

591
00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:51.050
The rest of you guys, just-just hang tough,
and we're gonna bring back some help.

592
00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:54.480
- Fuck that!
- We stick together. It's the best way.

593
00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:56.080
- <i>We separate-</i>
- We're dead.

594
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:58.880
<i>You got that right.</i>

595
00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:03.590
- Stump.
- I'm gonna take my chances, man.

596
00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:09.260
<i>Stump. Stay with us, man. Come on.</i>

597
00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:13.330
- When I get down, I'm gonna bring back help.
- This is stupid, man!

598
00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:16.130
Crank, <i>that</i> is
fuckin' stupid, man.

599
00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:21.300
I'm gonna bring back help.

600
00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:25.110
Shit.

601
00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:33.410
You guys ready for this?

602
00:50:33.490 --> 00:50:35.550
We got your back.

603
00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:58.470
<i>It stinks in here.</i>

604
00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:02.040
- <i>You see anything?</i>
- <i>There's only</i>
<i>one way they could've gone.</i>

605
00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:22.400
Dead end?
Where the fuck are they?

606
00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:28.030
<i>Guys.</i>

607
00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:39.150
Down here.

608
00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:56.930
I can't see shit.

609
00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:04.480
I'll check it out.
Wait for my signal.

610
00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:30.460
- <i>You good?</i>
- Clear!

611
00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:45.240
Shit!

612
00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:49.920
Oh, God.

613
00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:54.360
Oh, my God!

614
00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.200
Get 'em off me!

615
00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:01.860
You're fine.
It's all right.

616
00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:10.710
Jesus Christ.

617
00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:13.050
<i>You cool, Napoleon?</i>

618
00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:17.250
Yeah, I think so.
Aw, Jesus!

619
00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:20.590
- Come on, Crank.
- Where the hell are we?

620
00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:22.650
Next level down.

621
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:33.030
<i>All right. Okay.</i>

622
00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:51.290
Fuck!

623
00:53:55.490 --> 00:53:57.650
It's just fuckin' rocks.

624
00:53:57.730 --> 00:54:00.250
You're not gonna-

625
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:04.760
I'm not gonna let
you bastards get me.

626
00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:08.790
Not me, not today.
It's not gonna happen.

627
00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:15.800
Hey, guys.

628
00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:17.870
There's a breeze.

629
00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:33.650
<i>Hey.</i>

630
00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:46.340
Shit.

631
00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:54.550
This is where the fuckers hid
to cut the ropes.

632
00:54:57.350 --> 00:54:59.290
We can't just leave them
down there.

633
00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:03.490
<i>There's nothing we can do for 'em now except</i>
<i>find Missy and get the fuck out of here.</i>

634
00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:05.990
Missy's probably
dead too.

635
00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:09.290
<i>You're not doing anybody</i>
<i>any good talking like that.</i>

636
00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:01.780
Come on.

637
00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:15.560
<i>Delmar!</i>

638
00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:20.600
Delmar.

639
00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:46.720
Help me! Oh, God!

640
00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:49.130
Oh, no!

641
00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:01.740
<i>Is it a dead end?</i>

642
00:57:01.810 --> 00:57:05.710
<i>No. No, it goes through.</i>

643
00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:08.380
- How deep is it?
- Let's see.

644
00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:42.410
How many do you think
there are?

645
00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:45.010
Who knows?
Too many.

646
00:57:48.690 --> 00:57:50.960
- What are you doing?
- Saving one for myself.

647
00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:53.360
Hey!

648
00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:55.360
Do you remember
what Crank said?

649
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:57.560
"Dead is never better."

650
00:57:57.630 --> 00:57:59.660
We're gonna get
out of here.

651
00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:03.570
It's just-

652
00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:06.580
- Amber!
- Napoleon!

653
00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:09.370
Hang on! Shit!

654
00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:13.650
<i>Fuck!</i>

655
00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:17.080
- What the hell?
- Shit!

656
00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:19.280
Come on.

657
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:25.320
<i>You guys all right?</i>

658
00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:29.150
Amber.

659
00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:32.430
<i>Napoleon!</i>

660
00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:42.280
Where's my rifle?

661
00:58:42.350 --> 00:58:44.340
You okay? Shit.

662
00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:46.350
<i>Amber!</i>

663
00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:48.040
You guys all right?

664
00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:50.780
Yeah. We're all right.

665
00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:54.860
We're gonna find
a way down.

666
00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:58.220
- No problem.
- Hang on.

667
00:58:58.290 --> 00:59:00.290
Shit!

668
00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:13.810
Napoleon.

669
00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:19.880
What are you doing?

670
00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:34.820
Napoleon.

671
00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:41.740
I thought I heard something.

672
00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:52.310
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

673
00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:56.120
I think that's the level
they're on.

674
00:59:56.190 --> 00:59:59.820
- Do you think we could climb down without gear?
- <i>See that beam?</i>

675
00:59:59.890 --> 01:00:02.260
<i>If we can make it across,</i>
<i>we slide down that.</i>

676
01:00:02.330 --> 01:00:05.090
I think I can make
that jump.

677
01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:06.990
What are you doing?

678
01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:10.290
Crank? Crank? Wait!

679
01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:12.330
- <i>Crank!</i>
- Fuck!

680
01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:16.300
Shit!

681
01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:19.710
Delmar, your arm!

682
01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:21.510
<i>Your arm!</i>

683
01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.180
Hang on!

684
01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:41.730
Thanks.

685
01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:44.160
Let's keep it moving.

686
01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.130
Let's go.

687
01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:43.690
Oh, God.

688
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:47.290
Want.

689
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:53.730
Mama.

690
01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:57.140
Pretty.

691
01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:03.070
Dirty cunt!

692
01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:06.640
- No!
- Come here.

693
01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:09.280
Mine!

694
01:02:16.830 --> 01:02:19.120
So sweet.

695
01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:47.410
No. Was her. Papa. No.

696
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:05.530
- No.
- You give me baby.

697
01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:11.580
- Shit.
- Goddamn it. Come on.

698
01:03:11.650 --> 01:03:14.050
Motherfucker!

699
01:03:17.650 --> 01:03:19.590
<i>Missy!</i>

700
01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:22.320
<i>Help me!</i>

701
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:25.290
<i>Somebody, help me!</i>

702
01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:03.220
Shit. It's Stump's headband.

703
01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:05.230
What?

704
01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:11.070
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

705
01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:13.510
Oh, shit.

706
01:04:21.350 --> 01:04:24.050
Where is he?

707
01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:26.250
There!

708
01:04:29.290 --> 01:04:32.730
<i>There!</i>

709
01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:49.240
- Okay!
- Got you.

710
01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:08.460
Mine!

711
01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:23.210
Enough!

712
01:05:31.490 --> 01:05:33.920
<i>Kill them all.</i>

713
01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:38.160
Napoleon.
We gotta go.

714
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:40.820
He's got a gun.
Come on.

715
01:06:19.370 --> 01:06:21.100
Napoleon?

716
01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:29.680
The hatch. Get the hatch.
Get the hatch!

717
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:31.540
Shh! Shh.

718
01:06:33.450 --> 01:06:36.420
<i>Missy? Missy?</i>

719
01:06:36.490 --> 01:06:38.480
<i>Which way?</i>

720
01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:42.990
You safe here.

721
01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:46.190
<i>Safe.</i>

722
01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:49.200
<i>I'm right behind you. Let's go.</i>

723
01:06:51.370 --> 01:06:53.360
Goddamn.

724
01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:04.810
What the hell happened here?

725
01:07:16.290 --> 01:07:19.090
Come on, bitch!

726
01:07:23.770 --> 01:07:26.200
Yeah, baby!
It's all about volume!

727
01:07:26.270 --> 01:07:27.930
- <i>Gotta have volume!</i>
- It's Crank.

728
01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:32.730
- You okay?
- I'm all right. I'm all right.

729
01:07:32.810 --> 01:07:36.900
Lone Ranger shoulder wound.
Missed the bone completely.

730
01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:38.970
Damn.

731
01:07:42.290 --> 01:07:44.880
- You good?
- Yeah. Yeah.

732
01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:50.590
Who you fucking with, huh?
Who you fucking with?

733
01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:54.060
Crank? Crank?

734
01:07:54.130 --> 01:07:56.560
<i>You got any ammo left?</i>

735
01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:02.760
Fuck.

736
01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:05.000
<i>I'm out too.</i>

737
01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:16.410
Delmar. Your bayonet.

738
01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:23.460
- Crank. Delmar.
- Shit.

739
01:08:23.530 --> 01:08:25.520
Down here.

740
01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.090
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

741
01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:29.930
Oh, shit.
You guys are alive!

742
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.770
What happened to you?
Delmar, are you all right?

743
01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:37.930
- Be a hell of a lot better when we get out of here.
- Were you shot?

744
01:08:38.010 --> 01:08:40.480
- <i>I'm fine. It's nothing.</i>
- <i>You sure?</i>

745
01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:43.170
- Hi.
- Shit!

746
01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:45.680
What the hell is that?

747
01:08:45.750 --> 01:08:48.310
- He's okay.
- Are you out of your goddamn mind?
He's one of them.

748
01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:52.290
- No, he just saved our lives.
- <i>No fear. You come.</i>

749
01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:54.790
<i>Follow me.</i>

750
01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:01.460
Come.

751
01:09:30.230 --> 01:09:32.220
<i>This way.</i>

752
01:09:36.970 --> 01:09:39.800
- Whoa, whoa. You good?
- I'm all right.

753
01:09:39.870 --> 01:09:42.340
Don't worry.
I'm all right.

754
01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:44.570
We gotta get him outta here.

755
01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:46.770
Missy's not that far.
You heard her screams.

756
01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:49.440
How are we gonna get her outta
here without any goddamn ammo?

757
01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:52.880
- <i>We can fight 'em with rocks</i>
<i>and rifle butts if we have to.</i>
- Who's Rambo resurrected now?

758
01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:55.250
- I just wanna get everyone outta here.
- Yeah?

759
01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:58.620
- Well, tell that to Mickey and Spitter and Stump!
- Crank! Shut the hell up!

760
01:09:58.690 --> 01:10:02.220
- You trust that guy?
- He hid us from them. He didn't give us up.

761
01:10:02.290 --> 01:10:04.950
- We don't have any choice. We have to trust him.
- Bullshit!

762
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:08.260
- God knows where he's taking us.
- <i>To be honest with you...</i>

763
01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:12.530
I'm not sure God knows
anything about this place.

764
01:10:16.610 --> 01:10:18.730
Through here.

765
01:10:18.810 --> 01:10:21.440
Must through here.

766
01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:42.400
Jesus.

767
01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:48.670
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

768
01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:55.970
- <i>Holy shit!</i>
- <i>Oh, man!</i>

769
01:10:56.050 --> 01:10:59.240
Oh, God.

770
01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:08.920
- <i>Geez!</i>
- <i>What the fuck!</i>

771
01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:22.030
Oh, man.

772
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:46.930
Oh, my God!
It's Mickey!

773
01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.430
- <i>Don't look!</i>
- <i>Oh, God!</i>

774
01:11:53.740 --> 01:11:56.330
<i>You sick fuck! You should be shot!</i>

775
01:11:56.410 --> 01:11:58.810
- I should kill you!
- Crank!

776
01:11:58.870 --> 01:12:03.000
What, man? Why you always trying
to shut me down, Delmar, huh?

777
01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:06.140
- Don't freak out. Don't freak out.
- What the fuck?

778
01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:09.180
Don't freak out.
D-Don't freak out.

779
01:12:09.250 --> 01:12:12.310
- <i>Fuck, Delmar!</i>
- What?

780
01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:17.350
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait! Delmar.

781
01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:18.860
Delmar.

782
01:12:18.930 --> 01:12:23.630
Delmar.
What the fuck, man?

783
01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:25.560
You were hit twice?

784
01:12:29.410 --> 01:12:33.810
Oh, fuck. Why didn't-
Why didn't you tell me?

785
01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:37.840
Don't do this, man.
Don't do this!

786
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:42.010
Don't do this.
Don't leave me, man.

787
01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:44.450
Don't fucking leave me.

788
01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:49.580
Fuck!

789
01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:51.750
<i>Get me a medi-pack.</i>
<i>Napoleon!</i>

790
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:55.520
Get me- Get me a medi-pack.
Come on.

791
01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:59.590
Crank.

792
01:12:59.670 --> 01:13:01.860
I'm not gonna leave him.

793
01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:05.030
I'm not gonna leave him here.
You sick fuck!

794
01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:08.440
- You're not gonna have him!
- Okay, okay.

795
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:12.280
I'm gonna get you outta here.

796
01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:14.370
Get us outta here.

797
01:13:20.190 --> 01:13:22.180
Come.

798
01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:29.090
Come on.

799
01:13:50.650 --> 01:13:53.210
I'll get you outta here.

800
01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:15.140
<i>Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!</i>

801
01:14:15.210 --> 01:14:17.970
<i>I bet this leads outside!</i>

802
01:14:18.050 --> 01:14:20.280
Help me get this fuckin' door open.

803
01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:27.150
- <i>Come on!</i>
- Hey, would you forget it, Crank?

804
01:14:31.490 --> 01:14:34.720
Would you forget it? It's a blast door.
You're never gonna get it open.

805
01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:38.670
Fuck you!

806
01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:43.770
We need to get outta here,
you fucking retard!

807
01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:46.140
- Crank!
- How the fuck do we get outta here?

808
01:14:46.210 --> 01:14:49.440
- What about Missy?
- Would you get off this shit that she's alive?

809
01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:52.480
Missy is fucking dead!
Okay?

810
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:54.780
Just like the rest of 'em.

811
01:14:54.850 --> 01:14:57.980
Just like we're gonna be if
we don't get the fuck outta here!

812
01:14:58.050 --> 01:15:01.220
We are <i>not</i> leaving
this place without her.

813
01:15:01.290 --> 01:15:03.190
You're stupid, okay?

814
01:15:05.290 --> 01:15:09.750
How the fuck do we get outta here, man?
Which way is it?

815
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:12.700
What's over there?
What's over here?

816
01:15:12.770 --> 01:15:15.500
- <i>I'm going back for her!</i>
- Amber, stay here.

817
01:15:15.570 --> 01:15:17.200
- Guys!
- Amber?

818
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:20.300
<i>Oh, shit. Guys!</i>
<i>Check it out!</i>

819
01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:23.140
Everything we need.

820
01:15:23.210 --> 01:15:25.980
Hey!

821
01:15:26.050 --> 01:15:28.980
Everything we fucking need!

822
01:15:29.050 --> 01:15:31.490
<i>No touch. No touch.</i>

823
01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:34.550
- <i>No touch. No touch!</i>
- Amber.

824
01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:36.850
Please, don't. Hey!

825
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:41.760
- I'm begging you.
- I'd go back for you.

826
01:15:43.870 --> 01:15:45.800
Amber!

827
01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:52.770
Oh, yeah.

828
01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:55.440
Oh, yeah. Oh, shit.

829
01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:06.680
Oh, dynamite. Perfect.

830
01:16:11.230 --> 01:16:16.030
Oh, yeah. I'm gonna get
outta here after all.

831
01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:24.900
Oh, yeah. Oh, Delmar.
We're getting outta here, baby.

832
01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:32.540
What the-

833
01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:39.240
Fuck!

834
01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:47.690
<i>Oh, God. Crank!</i>

835
01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:51.390
- Oh, God. You okay?
- I'm all right.

836
01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:53.460
Crank!

837
01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:58.410
Crank?

838
01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:02.240
Crank!

839
01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:14.110
It's Missy.

840
01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:15.630
Let's do it.

841
01:19:56.050 --> 01:19:58.950
- Missy's phone.
- What?

842
01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:01.550
Do you still have

What are you doing?
