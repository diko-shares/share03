1
00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:04.703
Finally, a nice, big haunted
house for us to investigate.

2
00:00:04.705 --> 00:00:07.272
When the entity can --
runs down the hall,

3
00:00:07.274 --> 00:00:09.475
Sometimes it hissing at you.

4
00:00:09.477 --> 00:00:10.809
What we just heard was like --

5
00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:15.414
I have to get out.

6
00:00:15.416 --> 00:00:18.017
She's a human spirit.
She's suffering.

7
00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:19.852
Are you going after
my best friend?

8
00:00:19.854 --> 00:00:21.653
It's upstairs!

9
00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:23.022
Now!
It's up here now!

10
00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:28.494
From here on out,
we all stay together.

11
00:00:33.067 --> 00:00:36.268
They are the spirit hunters.

12
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.470
I feel something
behind me.

13
00:00:38.472 --> 00:00:40.939
They are who people call
when they are tormented

14
00:00:40.941 --> 00:00:44.510
By entities that circle back
night after night,

15
00:00:44.512 --> 00:00:47.179
Entities bent on destroying
the lives of the living.

16
00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:49.848
- Ho!
- Does this look like

17
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.517
The night
that you were murdered?

18
00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.752
These spirits are often trapped,

19
00:00:53.754 --> 00:00:55.387
Repeating the same trauma

20
00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:58.223
Over and over.

21
00:00:58.225 --> 00:00:59.691
The mission
of the spirit hunters

22
00:00:59.693 --> 00:01:03.562
Is to help the living
by breaking the cycle of...

23
00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:05.164
The ghost loop.

24
00:01:07.535 --> 00:01:11.070
The spirit hunters are in
prairie du rocher, illinois --

25
00:01:11.072 --> 00:01:14.440
A tiny village of only
650 people

26
00:01:14.442 --> 00:01:17.643
46 miles south of st. Louis.

27
00:01:17.645 --> 00:01:19.578
They are meeting
connie and susie,

28
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.581
The owner and manager of the
town's only bed and breakfast.

29
00:01:24.652 --> 00:01:26.085
It's pretty well
every day

30
00:01:26.087 --> 00:01:29.755
There's going to be
some type of incident.

31
00:01:29.757 --> 00:01:31.190
I felt like there
was somebody

32
00:01:31.192 --> 00:01:32.724
Looking over my shoulder.

33
00:01:32.726 --> 00:01:34.893
I mean the chill
would go up me,

34
00:01:34.895 --> 00:01:36.962
The hair would stand up
on the back of my neck,

35
00:01:36.964 --> 00:01:38.764
And the attic
door would open.

36
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:41.266
It's gotten known that,
you know, we're haunted.

37
00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:43.535
It has
taken business away.

38
00:01:43.537 --> 00:01:45.137
People are afraid to come.

39
00:01:48.676 --> 00:01:50.776
This area is beautiful.

40
00:01:50.778 --> 00:01:52.511
I don't see
a lot of people out,

41
00:01:52.513 --> 00:01:54.313
But I see
a lot of houses.

42
00:01:54.315 --> 00:01:57.483
It feels so empty.

43
00:01:57.485 --> 00:01:59.084
Looks abandoned.

44
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.723
There it is, guys.
There it is.

45
00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:08.994
Look at that attic
up there.

46
00:02:08.996 --> 00:02:11.763
Well, that's creepy.

47
00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:14.733
Finally, a nice, big haunted
house for us to investigate.

48
00:02:17.138 --> 00:02:19.638
The team hopes to break
the ghost loop

49
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.040
And save the business
from bankruptcy.

50
00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:23.775
But sean and kris
want to hear

51
00:02:23.777 --> 00:02:26.278
Susie and connie's story
firsthand.

52
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.781
Well, I purchased it
beginning of last year.

53
00:02:32.753 --> 00:02:35.087
I walked
into the back door

54
00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:37.322
And there was just --

55
00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:39.558
It sounded like someone
was bowling upstairs.

56
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.128
I mean there was doors
being slammed.

57
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.830
Like something was upset.

58
00:02:44.832 --> 00:02:46.198
Sounds really stressful.

59
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.066
So, you buy
this bed and breakfast

60
00:02:48.068 --> 00:02:50.435
And then you find out
that it's haunted...
Right.

61
00:02:50.437 --> 00:02:52.571
...And there's things
that are going on here.
Right, right.

62
00:02:52.573 --> 00:02:56.108
It's very evident
that the woman --

63
00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.044
We've named her
the woman in white --

64
00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:01.713
Is...

65
00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:03.348
...I guess
caught in a loop.

66
00:03:05.152 --> 00:03:07.119
So the ghost loop
of activity

67
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:08.720
That you're experiencing
throughout the house,

68
00:03:08.722 --> 00:03:10.889
Where does it go,
where does it end?

69
00:03:10.891 --> 00:03:14.026
She starts in
the new orleans room,

70
00:03:14.028 --> 00:03:15.761
Kind of walks down
the hall...

71
00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:23.101
...And then she ascends
into the attic.

72
00:03:23.103 --> 00:03:25.370
Sometimes I'll be upstairs,
and I can just feel

73
00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:27.172
Something go by me
really quick

74
00:03:27.174 --> 00:03:29.708
And almost brush
through your hair.

75
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.109
But when you turn
and look again,

76
00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:32.644
Of course
there's no one there.

77
00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:36.782
I mean, it just
sends chills down me.

78
00:03:36.784 --> 00:03:39.851
I've also been sitting
in there and heard a growl.

79
00:03:39.853 --> 00:03:42.788
Yes, which makes my skin crawl
even more.

80
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.357
- I can do without that.
- Right. I don't blame you.

81
00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.125
It seems like
it's very aggressive

82
00:03:47.127 --> 00:03:49.728
And it is trying
to make itself known.

83
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.396
In your opinion,

84
00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:53.732
Who do you think
this lady is?

85
00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:57.436
The original owner's name
is constance,

86
00:03:57.438 --> 00:03:59.905
Which just happens
to be<i> my</i> name.

87
00:03:59.907 --> 00:04:02.874
Wow.
Yeah.

88
00:04:02.876 --> 00:04:07.813
Conner house was built
by constance conner in 1906.

89
00:04:07.815 --> 00:04:10.616
Constance famously had
the town divert its main street

90
00:04:10.618 --> 00:04:11.984
To accommodate her new home

91
00:04:11.986 --> 00:04:15.354
And force travelers
to go by the family business.

92
00:04:15.356 --> 00:04:17.155
This strong-willed woman
lived in the house

93
00:04:17.157 --> 00:04:19.091
For the rest of her life,

94
00:04:19.093 --> 00:04:22.427
Dying in her own bed in 1939.

95
00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:24.963
Once constance conner
passed away,

96
00:04:24.965 --> 00:04:27.699
There was a woman
and her son

97
00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:31.637
Who had the house
for the next 25, 30 years,

98
00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.306
And it was
a boarding house.

99
00:04:34.308 --> 00:04:36.275
Boarding houses operated
as places

100
00:04:36.277 --> 00:04:38.410
Where people could find
cheap accommodation

101
00:04:38.412 --> 00:04:41.980
During the mid 19th century
to the 1930s.

102
00:04:41.982 --> 00:04:44.216
The housing boom in the 1950s

103
00:04:44.218 --> 00:04:46.551
Made boarding house obsolete,

104
00:04:46.553 --> 00:04:48.820
And some became places
where the unwanted,

105
00:04:48.822 --> 00:04:50.856
Such as the mentally ill,

106
00:04:50.858 --> 00:04:54.092
Were hidden away from society.

107
00:04:54.094 --> 00:04:55.661
There was a woman
that contacted me

108
00:04:55.663 --> 00:04:57.462
And said that
she stayed here

109
00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:59.698
And the room
that is now the bathroom,

110
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.300
It wasn't a bathroom
at that time.

111
00:05:01.302 --> 00:05:03.268
It was a bedroom.

112
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.605
And no one was allowed
in that room.

113
00:05:06.607 --> 00:05:09.708
The room was kept for
undesirables

114
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.511
Like an unwed mother

115
00:05:12.513 --> 00:05:15.514
Or someone that had
a mental illness.

116
00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:20.752
Now a ghost loop begins
in the undesirable room

117
00:05:20.754 --> 00:05:22.821
And races through the house
to the attic.

118
00:05:24.692 --> 00:05:27.726
The activity
is driving business away.

119
00:05:27.728 --> 00:05:30.462
When people call now, they'll
give me the reservation --

120
00:05:30.464 --> 00:05:32.130
They may even give me
the credit card --

121
00:05:32.132 --> 00:05:33.532
And all of a sudden
they're like,

122
00:05:33.534 --> 00:05:36.601
"wait a second, is this
the property that's haunted?

123
00:05:36.603 --> 00:05:39.838
Well, you know, aunt marge
is not gonna stay there.
Right. Wow.
That's right.

124
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.940
This is not gonna happen,"
you know.

125
00:05:41.942 --> 00:05:44.843
If this doesn't work,
I'm not sure exactly
what we're gonna do.

126
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.014
I have visions before we go
to some locations

127
00:05:49.016 --> 00:05:52.017
And this vision
was of a woman,

128
00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:54.052
And she was staring
at a picture of herself.

129
00:05:54.054 --> 00:05:56.922
It was framed, and she was
punching it until it cracked,

130
00:05:56.924 --> 00:05:59.057
And she had, like,
dark hair.

131
00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:00.525
I'm not sure

132
00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:02.060
If that has something to do
with the property,

133
00:06:02.062 --> 00:06:04.062
But, you know, I'm definitely
taking note to it

134
00:06:04.064 --> 00:06:06.031
Considering
what happens here.

135
00:06:06.033 --> 00:06:07.866
Did you see the picture

136
00:06:07.868 --> 00:06:10.435
That's hanging
in the house?
No.

137
00:06:10.437 --> 00:06:12.704
Inside the parlor
is a picture connie found

138
00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:15.741
When she bought
the house and now displays.

139
00:06:15.743 --> 00:06:19.144
Well, that looks like the
woman that I saw my my vision.

140
00:06:19.146 --> 00:06:22.447
Dark hair,
white complexion.
Yeah.

141
00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:24.449
Did you see the light
just flicker?
Yeah.
Yeah.

142
00:06:24.451 --> 00:06:27.119
As we're talking
about the lady in white.

143
00:06:27.121 --> 00:06:28.520
Let's go this way.

144
00:06:28.522 --> 00:06:30.989
She usually walks
from this room

145
00:06:30.991 --> 00:06:33.825
And paces up and down
the hall.

146
00:06:33.827 --> 00:06:37.362
And then that's why we think
the door is always open.

147
00:06:37.364 --> 00:06:39.931
- Wow.
- We close it, it opens.

148
00:06:39.933 --> 00:06:43.301
It's always opening?
It's always opening,
yeah.

149
00:06:43.303 --> 00:06:47.906
we have
stood here and watched it open.

150
00:06:47.908 --> 00:06:50.041
Wow.

151
00:06:50.043 --> 00:06:53.812
It's really impressive
up here -- thick.
My god.

152
00:06:53.814 --> 00:06:57.082
Like, oof --
I'm, like, super anxious.

153
00:06:57.084 --> 00:06:58.617
Yeah, it's like
a dizzy feeling.

154
00:06:58.619 --> 00:07:00.519
- Wow.<i> I'm</i> dizzy.
- Yeah.

155
00:07:00.521 --> 00:07:03.054
It's like the air's --
yeah, but I don't get --
I'm up here all the time.

156
00:07:03.056 --> 00:07:05.557
I don't get dizzy.

157
00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:08.560
The energy proves too much
for connie and susie,

158
00:07:08.562 --> 00:07:09.895
And they leave
the spirit hunters

159
00:07:09.897 --> 00:07:11.396
To their investigation.

160
00:07:16.437 --> 00:07:18.437
- How we doing guys?
- What's up, guys?

161
00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:21.473
So there is<i> huge</i> stakes.

162
00:07:21.475 --> 00:07:23.675
They really need to have
the business come back

163
00:07:23.677 --> 00:07:25.076
Into this
bed and breakfast.

164
00:07:25.078 --> 00:07:26.678
And this haunting,
what they're experiencing,

165
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.314
Is stopping people
from staying here.

166
00:07:29.316 --> 00:07:31.283
- Wow, this is huge, guys.
- Yeah.

167
00:07:31.285 --> 00:07:32.484
Really feel
for these ladies.

168
00:07:32.486 --> 00:07:34.085
We got to do whatever it takes
to help them.

169
00:07:34.087 --> 00:07:35.787
- Let's do it.
- Let's go.

170
00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:38.423
Before they begin, sean
lets the rest of the team in

171
00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:41.693
On a clue that might help with
the rest of the investigation.

172
00:07:41.695 --> 00:07:42.928
When I told you guys
about that vision

173
00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.630
I had about the woman
hidden in the picture.

174
00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:47.632
Well, they said that there's
a picture in the house

175
00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:49.768
They believe
is the lady in white,

176
00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.070
And they actually showed me
the picture right over here,

177
00:07:52.072 --> 00:07:54.706
And it looks exactly
like the woman.

178
00:07:54.708 --> 00:07:55.774
- My god, dude.
- No, no, no, no.

179
00:07:55.776 --> 00:07:57.108
No, no-no-no-no, no.
- Holy ****.

180
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.510
That's the girl
from your dream?
Yeah.

181
00:07:58.512 --> 00:08:00.679
Why don't you guys
start up in the attic...
M'kay.

182
00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:02.414
...And definitely
be careful

183
00:08:02.416 --> 00:08:04.616
Because it is
<i> oppressive</i> up there.
Okay.

184
00:08:04.618 --> 00:08:07.452
All of us were
affected by it.
I mean, even eric being in this
house for a short time,

185
00:08:07.454 --> 00:08:09.955
Look at him.
He's looking pale now.
Yeah, I'm not really
feeling that good.

186
00:08:09.957 --> 00:08:11.256
You look a little off.
We all --

187
00:08:11.258 --> 00:08:12.657
And even the<i> homeowner.</i>
Yeah.

188
00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:14.159
She actually
was giving us a tour

189
00:08:14.161 --> 00:08:15.827
When we actually went up
in the attic.

190
00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:17.362
She's like, "I've never
felt this way,"

191
00:08:17.364 --> 00:08:18.930
And she felt queasy.
We were all sitting there --

192
00:08:18.932 --> 00:08:20.332
Like our equilibrium
was off.

193
00:08:20.334 --> 00:08:23.134
- That's exactly how I feel.
- Highly, highly active property.

194
00:08:23.136 --> 00:08:24.636
There's a lot to cover.

195
00:08:24.638 --> 00:08:26.404
Just be careful
and mindful

196
00:08:26.406 --> 00:08:27.973
Of your emotions
and how you're feeling

197
00:08:27.975 --> 00:08:29.941
Because whatever
is upstairs

198
00:08:29.943 --> 00:08:32.143
Was tapping into
not just<i> our</i> energy

199
00:08:32.145 --> 00:08:34.746
But also
connie's energy, too.
Yeah.

200
00:08:34.748 --> 00:08:38.517
While sean, eric, and kris
start in the new orleans suite

201
00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:40.318
The onset of the ghost loop,

202
00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.954
Matt and califf
go to where it ends --

203
00:08:42.956 --> 00:08:44.489
The attic.

204
00:08:44.491 --> 00:08:46.291
- Alright, brother, let's go.
- Alright.

205
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.029
A lot of space.

206
00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:53.431
H- holy ****.

207
00:08:54.935 --> 00:08:57.335
It's very unwelcoming.

208
00:09:01.174 --> 00:09:03.508
Like why am I
out of breath, you know?

209
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:04.609
Take a second.

210
00:09:04.611 --> 00:09:07.045
Breathe. Breathe.

211
00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:07.913
It's heavy.

212
00:09:07.915 --> 00:09:09.447
Now focus.

213
00:09:09.449 --> 00:09:11.182
Let's see if there's
an actual reason

214
00:09:11.184 --> 00:09:13.385
For any of this
to be happening.
Okay.
Let's do it.

215
00:09:13.387 --> 00:09:15.654
Okay?
Yeah.

216
00:09:15.656 --> 00:09:16.721
I don't know, man.

217
00:09:19.826 --> 00:09:22.394
I just feel like
we're being watched.

218
00:09:28.702 --> 00:09:30.368
Alright, well, I'm gonna start
the spirit box.

219
00:09:37.177 --> 00:09:38.877
who's here
with us right now?

220
00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:40.278
Tell us your name.

221
00:09:44.952 --> 00:09:47.218
That was a lady.
That was a woman.

222
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.787
what's your name?

223
00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:52.724
Please.

224
00:09:52.726 --> 00:09:53.992
Do you need our help?

225
00:09:59.733 --> 00:10:01.533
Is there anything
evil here?

226
00:10:01.535 --> 00:10:03.668
If so, come through
this box right now.

227
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.170
Show yourself.

228
00:10:09.643 --> 00:10:11.242
What is your name?

229
00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.146
Conner.
Conner!

230
00:10:25.225 --> 00:10:28.660
The spirit hunters are in
prairie du rocher, illinois,

231
00:10:28.662 --> 00:10:30.261
Investigating a ghost loop

232
00:10:30.263 --> 00:10:32.230
That is having
a devastating effect

233
00:10:32.232 --> 00:10:33.832
On this bed and breakfast.

234
00:10:33.834 --> 00:10:35.900
It's gotten known
that there's --

235
00:10:35.902 --> 00:10:36.935
You know, we're haunted.

236
00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:43.241
This is definitely
a reoccurring thing.

237
00:10:45.278 --> 00:10:47.712
It has taken
business away.
Yeah.

238
00:10:47.714 --> 00:10:50.782
People are afraid
to come.

239
00:10:50.784 --> 00:10:54.185
The building began
as the home of constance conner,

240
00:10:54.187 --> 00:10:56.921
Who is rumored
to still haunt its halls.

241
00:10:56.923 --> 00:10:58.623
what is your name?

242
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.561
Conner.
Conner!

243
00:11:03.563 --> 00:11:06.164
But it was also once
a boarding house

244
00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:08.633
That, in its years of decline,
had one room

245
00:11:08.635 --> 00:11:11.536
For what locals
called "undesirables,"

246
00:11:11.538 --> 00:11:14.739
People who were forcibly kept
from society.

247
00:11:14.741 --> 00:11:16.608
From what I understand,

248
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.843
That means unwed mother

249
00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:22.614
Or someone that had
a mental illness.

250
00:11:22.616 --> 00:11:26.117
Eric, sean, and kris
are investigating that room,

251
00:11:26.119 --> 00:11:29.087
Which is also where the ghost
loop starts every night.

252
00:11:31.758 --> 00:11:34.592
Let's shut off some lights and
make it a little darker in here.

253
00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:40.365
So, you want to start
with the portable gateway?

254
00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:41.933
Yeah, let's start
with the portable gateway.

255
00:11:41.935 --> 00:11:44.936
see who's here with us.

256
00:11:44.938 --> 00:11:46.371
You feel anything.

257
00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:48.440
Kind of feeling
the lady's energy.

258
00:11:48.442 --> 00:11:51.876
Let's give her a chance
to speak to us.

259
00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:58.349
You don't have
to be afraid of us!

260
00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:02.487
We ask that the lady in white
come forward...

261
00:12:02.489 --> 00:12:05.790
...And speak through the device
that sean is holding.

262
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.697
Were you held captive
in this room?

263
00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:17.435
What happened in this room?

264
00:12:22.843 --> 00:12:24.209
Do not leave?
Do not leave.

265
00:12:24.211 --> 00:12:26.644
Wow!
Do you need our help?

266
00:12:26.646 --> 00:12:28.179
Can we help you?

267
00:12:29.983 --> 00:12:31.683
Are you trapped here still?

268
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.221
Why did they imprison
you up here?

269
00:12:44.698 --> 00:12:46.297
I don't like that.

270
00:12:49.536 --> 00:12:51.970
What is your name?

271
00:12:51.972 --> 00:12:53.705
Anne.

272
00:12:53.707 --> 00:12:55.240
Anna's here.

273
00:12:55.242 --> 00:12:56.975
Now we know her name.

274
00:12:56.977 --> 00:12:59.110
Anna?
She wants help.

275
00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:01.446
I mean, she's making
her presence known.

276
00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:11.422
who's here
with us right now?

277
00:13:11.424 --> 00:13:13.057
What is your name?

278
00:13:15.262 --> 00:13:17.629
Conner.
Conner!

279
00:13:17.631 --> 00:13:21.332
My god.
It was a female voice, too!

280
00:13:21.334 --> 00:13:24.068
Holy.
That was clear as day.

281
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.071
Are we speaking
with<i> constance</i> conner?

282
00:13:29.476 --> 00:13:31.342
Yeah.

283
00:13:31.344 --> 00:13:32.610
It just said hi!

284
00:13:32.612 --> 00:13:35.213
Hi, constance.

285
00:13:35.215 --> 00:13:36.214
- Hi.
- Hi.

286
00:13:36.216 --> 00:13:38.149
Holy!

287
00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:39.317
- Constance.
- Talk to her!

288
00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:41.386
Constance,
we're here to help you.

289
00:13:43.089 --> 00:13:44.756
I almost want to...

290
00:13:44.758 --> 00:13:46.624
I almost want to sit
at that table.

291
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.300
Constance,
are you still with us?

292
00:13:57.337 --> 00:13:58.636
Constance.

293
00:13:58.638 --> 00:14:01.773
Can you come here
and sit down with us, please?

294
00:14:01.775 --> 00:14:04.075
Suddenly constance goes quiet

295
00:14:04.077 --> 00:14:06.144
And another voice takes over.

296
00:14:06.146 --> 00:14:08.646
We're not talking to you.

297
00:14:08.648 --> 00:14:09.881
That male voice
coming through

298
00:14:09.883 --> 00:14:11.482
Doesn't sound nice.

299
00:14:11.484 --> 00:14:13.351
Constance, are you there?

300
00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:20.391
Constance,
my name is matt.

301
00:14:20.393 --> 00:14:23.127
What did they do to you
when you were alive?

302
00:14:26.399 --> 00:14:27.999
Knife?
Knife?

303
00:14:28.001 --> 00:14:29.334
From a male voice.

304
00:14:29.336 --> 00:14:31.603
Who are you?!

305
00:14:31.605 --> 00:14:33.171
I'm talking to the man
that's here.

306
00:14:33.173 --> 00:14:34.339
Who are you?

307
00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.577
We're right here.

308
00:14:39.579 --> 00:14:42.313
I'm talking to the man
that's in this house.

309
00:14:42.315 --> 00:14:44.716
Let's go.

310
00:14:44.718 --> 00:14:45.850
He said, "alright."

311
00:14:45.852 --> 00:14:47.118
Alright.

312
00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.786
You tell me
when and where to be.

313
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.056
It just said
"warning," bro.

314
00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:54.359
It's a male spirit
that just said "warning."

315
00:14:54.361 --> 00:14:56.227
Is that
your warning to me?

316
00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:58.830
Are you going after
my best friend?

317
00:14:58.832 --> 00:15:00.431
He said yes, dude.

318
00:15:00.433 --> 00:15:02.901
We're getting these voices
coming through the spirit box.

319
00:15:02.903 --> 00:15:06.938
One is a female
who we do believe is constance,

320
00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:10.041
And another is --
we're not sure if it's evil.

321
00:15:10.043 --> 00:15:12.210
We're not exactly
sure what it is.

322
00:15:12.212 --> 00:15:14.345
Are we sure that's not
a woman's voice?

323
00:15:14.347 --> 00:15:16.047
Matt knows aggressive spirits

324
00:15:16.049 --> 00:15:18.516
Can take on female
or male voices

325
00:15:18.518 --> 00:15:19.817
To intimidate the living.

326
00:15:19.819 --> 00:15:22.186
This could be a female spirit.

327
00:15:22.188 --> 00:15:25.623
Meanwhile, sean and kris
go to the "undesirable" room

328
00:15:25.625 --> 00:15:27.659
To draw out the spirit anna,

329
00:15:27.661 --> 00:15:30.194
Who they think
was confined there.

330
00:15:30.196 --> 00:15:33.398
Was this area
of the house a prison to you?

331
00:15:41.775 --> 00:15:44.943
<i> was this area</i>
<i> of the house a prison to you?</i>

332
00:15:52.986 --> 00:15:54.552
The hell was that?

333
00:15:54.554 --> 00:15:57.021
That was a woman.

334
00:15:57.023 --> 00:16:00.158
<i> Who was this area of house</i>
<i> a prison to you?</i>

335
00:16:05.265 --> 00:16:06.631
anna.
Let's do it again,

336
00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:08.566
And let's confirm the name
if we can.

337
00:16:12.172 --> 00:16:13.771
Is your name anna?

338
00:16:17.377 --> 00:16:20.778
Alright.

339
00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.814
<i> is your name anna?</i>

340
00:16:24.617 --> 00:16:26.417
Dude, does it say,
"yes, it is?"

341
00:16:28.855 --> 00:16:30.421
That says, "yes, it is."
says, "yes, it is."

342
00:16:30.423 --> 00:16:31.556
Yep.

343
00:16:32.993 --> 00:16:35.526
Yes, it is.

344
00:16:35.528 --> 00:16:38.463
Just feeling this overall
very negative energy --

345
00:16:38.465 --> 00:16:40.598
Really awful things
have happened here.

346
00:16:44.471 --> 00:16:48.973
During the day, it looks
very peaceful and calm.

347
00:16:48.975 --> 00:16:52.443
But at night, it has
a totally different vibe to it.

348
00:16:58.018 --> 00:16:59.617
I don't like this house.

349
00:16:59.619 --> 00:17:01.152
I like how it makes<i> me</i> feel.

350
00:17:01.154 --> 00:17:04.422
I don't like watching
how it makes my teammates feel.

351
00:17:04.424 --> 00:17:07.792
It's a very creepy feeling
and it's a very,

352
00:17:07.794 --> 00:17:10.595
"don't come here,
don't come here," vibe.

353
00:17:16.436 --> 00:17:19.971
whatever's here, don't be afraid
to speak with me.

354
00:17:24.144 --> 00:17:26.411
Eric.
It's calling me out.

355
00:17:28.348 --> 00:17:30.381
I was a little creeped out.

356
00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:33.084
I mean, this is the most
active location we've been on.

357
00:17:35.588 --> 00:17:37.789
Was something trying
to drain my energy before,

358
00:17:37.791 --> 00:17:40.291
'cause I really didn't
feel good in his home.

359
00:17:48.501 --> 00:17:49.801
What happened to you?

360
00:17:49.803 --> 00:17:52.370
I need to know what happened
to you in this room.

361
00:17:52.372 --> 00:17:53.938
Help.

362
00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.240
We're going to help you.
That's why we're here.

363
00:17:58.511 --> 00:17:59.510
Rope.

364
00:17:59.512 --> 00:18:01.312
Was somebody hung
in this house?

365
00:18:08.054 --> 00:18:10.888
You trying to tell me
you were hung in this house?

366
00:18:13.093 --> 00:18:16.227
Was someone hung in this hall?
I heard you say "rope."

367
00:18:18.164 --> 00:18:19.597
Blood.

368
00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:22.266
Again that spider web feeling
on the side of my face.

369
00:18:25.905 --> 00:18:26.938
Wow.

370
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.073
That's really unsettling...

371
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.009
...To say the least.

372
00:18:32.011 --> 00:18:33.010
Anna's dangerous.

373
00:18:33.012 --> 00:18:34.178
You know, she's a human spirit.

374
00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.446
She's suffering.

375
00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:37.115
- It's upstairs!
- It's up here now!

376
00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:38.649
We just **** heard it!

377
00:18:38.651 --> 00:18:39.484
Holy --

378
00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.128
At this bed and breakfast
in illinois,

379
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.630
Connie and susie are being
attacked by a ghost loop

380
00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:54.732
They call the lady in white.

381
00:18:57.971 --> 00:18:59.737
Sometimes, it hisses at you

382
00:18:59.739 --> 00:19:01.405
And pushes you.

383
00:19:01.407 --> 00:19:03.941
While sean and kris
discover an entity named anna

384
00:19:03.943 --> 00:19:06.043
Who was locked away
from society...

385
00:19:08.681 --> 00:19:10.915
...Eric finds out
what may have happened to her.

386
00:19:12.085 --> 00:19:13.084
Rope.

387
00:19:13.086 --> 00:19:15.987
Was somebody hung
in his house?

388
00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:18.122
That's really unsettling...

389
00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:21.425
...To say the least.

390
00:19:21.427 --> 00:19:24.028
Dude, what happened?
Like, I don't know
what happened in this house

391
00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:26.264
But a voice said "rope."

392
00:19:26.266 --> 00:19:27.999
I don't know if someone
was hung in this house.

393
00:19:30.069 --> 00:19:31.802
They've always thought
that someone may have been

394
00:19:31.804 --> 00:19:33.304
Hung up in the attic.

395
00:19:33.306 --> 00:19:35.907
We don't know if there's any
factual evidence behind that,

396
00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:37.875
But that's something
to pay attention to.

397
00:19:37.877 --> 00:19:40.878
I'm just really taken aback.
I didn't expect that.

398
00:19:44.617 --> 00:19:47.051
Now the team
is settling in for an overnight

399
00:19:47.053 --> 00:19:48.486
In the bed and breakfast

400
00:19:48.488 --> 00:19:50.922
To see what connie's customers
are suffering through.

401
00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:56.060
You have to get down to exactly
what's taking place here,

402
00:19:56.062 --> 00:19:57.328
And this is a business.

403
00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:58.396
People are staying here,

404
00:19:58.398 --> 00:19:59.730
And this is when
it's happening to them,

405
00:19:59.732 --> 00:20:01.199
So this is why we're here.

406
00:20:36.102 --> 00:20:38.202
I am currently
in the mississippi room

407
00:20:38.204 --> 00:20:40.104
Trying to get some sleep,

408
00:20:40.106 --> 00:20:42.506
But I don't think
I'm gonna be able to.

409
00:20:42.508 --> 00:20:45.309
Every time I shut my eyes,
I hear a tapping sound

410
00:20:45.311 --> 00:20:48.179
To the left of me
near the bathroom,

411
00:20:48.181 --> 00:20:52.016
And it it's like something
is trying to get my attention.

412
00:20:52.018 --> 00:20:53.351
I'm so drained.

413
00:20:53.353 --> 00:20:54.986
I just want to go to bed,

414
00:20:54.988 --> 00:20:57.955
But I don't think
I'm gonna be able to.

415
00:21:01.828 --> 00:21:04.562
As the time
for the ghost loop approaches,

416
00:21:04.564 --> 00:21:06.264
Kris becomes more sensitive

417
00:21:06.266 --> 00:21:08.099
To the frenetic energy
of the house.

418
00:21:10.003 --> 00:21:11.335
I just can feel somebody

419
00:21:11.337 --> 00:21:13.437
Pacing back and forth
like they're lost,

420
00:21:13.439 --> 00:21:15.640
And it's just this
constant cycle.

421
00:21:15.642 --> 00:21:18.542
Whatever is here,
whoever this lady and white is,

422
00:21:18.544 --> 00:21:19.677
She's lost.

423
00:21:19.679 --> 00:21:21.012
She doesn't know
what's happening.

424
00:21:21.014 --> 00:21:24.448
She's not aware
that she has passed on,

425
00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:26.717
And that's the issue
that we're having.

426
00:21:26.719 --> 00:21:28.686
She is trapped in this loop.

427
00:21:34.494 --> 00:21:36.193
There's something that is here

428
00:21:36.195 --> 00:21:37.695
That is trapping her

429
00:21:37.697 --> 00:21:40.231
And keeping her here.

430
00:21:40.233 --> 00:21:43.867
Sean and eric sense
the changing energy, as well,

431
00:21:43.869 --> 00:21:46.037
And are drawn to where
the ghost loop begins.

432
00:21:49.175 --> 00:21:52.209
This is where we got
the most responses so far.

433
00:21:52.211 --> 00:21:54.745
This place is a whirlwind
of energies and emotions.

434
00:21:57.817 --> 00:21:58.983
Anna?

435
00:22:01.154 --> 00:22:03.454
Don't be afraid
to speak with me.

436
00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:08.259
I'm here to help you.

437
00:22:11.898 --> 00:22:13.831
Was somebody killed here
in this house?

438
00:22:16.803 --> 00:22:18.336
How were they killed?

439
00:22:22.875 --> 00:22:25.710
Hung?
Hung!

440
00:22:25.712 --> 00:22:27.211
Can you tell us
which room?

441
00:22:31.751 --> 00:22:33.150
- The attic.
- In the attic!

442
00:22:33.152 --> 00:22:35.519
- The attic.
- In the attic.

443
00:22:35.521 --> 00:22:36.620
When?

444
00:22:40.893 --> 00:22:43.961
Sean and eric rushed
to investigate in the attic

445
00:22:43.963 --> 00:22:47.531
But were stopped
in the path of the ghost loop.

446
00:22:49.836 --> 00:22:51.769
The **** was that?

447
00:22:51.771 --> 00:22:53.904
Did you hear that?
Who did that?

448
00:22:53.906 --> 00:22:55.206
Hold on.
- Did you heard it, too?

449
00:22:55.208 --> 00:22:56.741
Did you hear that? Matt!

450
00:22:56.743 --> 00:22:58.275
What?!

451
00:22:58.277 --> 00:22:59.877
What?
- Did you hear it?

452
00:22:59.879 --> 00:23:01.946
- Are you by yourself?
- Yes!

453
00:23:01.948 --> 00:23:04.281
I've experienced
a lot of disembodied voices

454
00:23:04.283 --> 00:23:06.016
In my time over the years.

455
00:23:06.018 --> 00:23:07.418
I mean, I was the loudest

456
00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:09.320
Disembodied voice
I've ever heard.

457
00:23:09.322 --> 00:23:11.989
- Freaking me out.
- Dude, so we were just standing

458
00:23:11.991 --> 00:23:14.125
Right there.
My god.
What?

459
00:23:14.127 --> 00:23:16.093
- We were standing right here.
- Calm, calm.

460
00:23:16.095 --> 00:23:18.763
We were standing right here.
We were waiting for matt.
My god.

461
00:23:18.765 --> 00:23:20.865
We were gonna go up there
and do a session,

462
00:23:20.867 --> 00:23:22.032
And dude.

463
00:23:22.034 --> 00:23:24.201
Holy...!
My god.

464
00:23:24.203 --> 00:23:26.670
- My god!
- My god!

465
00:23:26.672 --> 00:23:28.739
It was so loud.
- Dude, literally, it was --

466
00:23:31.077 --> 00:23:33.644
My god!
We literally
just freaked the **** out.

467
00:23:33.646 --> 00:23:35.279
We go upstairs and sean and eric

468
00:23:35.281 --> 00:23:37.314
Are running around the house
like madmen, freaking out.

469
00:23:37.316 --> 00:23:38.916
But what we just heard
was like something

470
00:23:38.918 --> 00:23:40.951
Out of a horror movie.

471
00:23:40.953 --> 00:23:43.821
I mean, no words are coming out
of their faces that make sense.

472
00:23:43.823 --> 00:23:47.224
It just --
that went for like a good --

473
00:23:47.226 --> 00:23:49.260
So eric and I make our way
up to the attic.

474
00:23:49.262 --> 00:23:52.830
And literally it was --

475
00:23:52.832 --> 00:23:54.231
It was just like that.

476
00:23:54.233 --> 00:23:56.500
And...Like...

477
00:23:56.502 --> 00:23:58.002
I hear the sound.

478
00:23:58.004 --> 00:23:59.770
We just **** heard it!

479
00:23:59.772 --> 00:24:01.439
- It's upstairs!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

480
00:24:01.441 --> 00:24:03.140
- Are you serious?!
- Grab that.

481
00:24:03.142 --> 00:24:04.208
Holy --

482
00:24:10.616 --> 00:24:14.084
Customers are staying away
from this bed and breakfast

483
00:24:14.086 --> 00:24:15.653
Because of a ghost loop.

484
00:24:20.593 --> 00:24:22.660
The spirit hunters are
investigating overnight

485
00:24:22.662 --> 00:24:25.429
To see what evidence
they can collect...

486
00:24:25.431 --> 00:24:26.897
Can you tell
us which room?

487
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:29.366
- The attic.
- In the attic!

488
00:24:34.273 --> 00:24:36.941
...But instead, find
themselves caught in the loop.

489
00:24:38.611 --> 00:24:40.544
The **** was that?

490
00:24:40.546 --> 00:24:42.680
Did you hear that?
Who did that?

491
00:24:42.682 --> 00:24:43.981
Hold on.
- Did you heard it, too?

492
00:24:43.983 --> 00:24:45.516
Did you hear that? Matt!

493
00:24:45.518 --> 00:24:47.051
What?!

494
00:24:47.053 --> 00:24:48.652
What?
- Did you hear it?

495
00:24:48.654 --> 00:24:51.155
- Are you by yourself?
- Yes!

496
00:24:51.157 --> 00:24:52.690
It was insane.

497
00:24:52.692 --> 00:24:54.391
- What?
- I mean, that was the loudest

498
00:24:54.393 --> 00:24:56.327
Disembodied voice
I've ever heard.

499
00:24:56.329 --> 00:24:59.463
We were just standing
right there.
My god.
What?

500
00:24:59.465 --> 00:25:01.165
We go upstairs and sean and eric

501
00:25:01.167 --> 00:25:02.566
Are running around
the house like madmen.

502
00:25:02.568 --> 00:25:04.435
Holy...!
My god.

503
00:25:04.437 --> 00:25:06.570
- My god.
- My god!

504
00:25:06.572 --> 00:25:09.273
It just --
that went for like a good --

505
00:25:09.275 --> 00:25:11.242
Seriously?
That's how good it was.
No joke.
Dude, like, seriously.

506
00:25:11.244 --> 00:25:13.644
I see a vent right above us,
so clearly I'm gonna go up there

507
00:25:13.646 --> 00:25:15.813
And look to see the sound
could've come through the vent.

508
00:25:15.815 --> 00:25:17.414
Sean, stand here.

509
00:25:17.416 --> 00:25:19.884
So eric and I
made our way up to the attic.

510
00:25:19.886 --> 00:25:22.987
My god, dude.
I know.

511
00:25:22.989 --> 00:25:24.622
- Hey, sean.
- Yeah.

512
00:25:24.624 --> 00:25:26.490
There's no vent opening
up here.

513
00:25:26.492 --> 00:25:28.058
What you heard is legit.

514
00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:29.493
That was incredible.
Straight up legit.

515
00:25:29.495 --> 00:25:31.028
We stepped
into the center and then...

516
00:25:32.698 --> 00:25:34.465
We just **** heard it!

517
00:25:34.467 --> 00:25:36.033
- It's upstairs!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

518
00:25:36.035 --> 00:25:37.968
- Are you serious?!
- Holy --

519
00:25:39.972 --> 00:25:42.106
- That was -- my god, dude.
- You both heard it again?

520
00:25:42.108 --> 00:25:45.342
- Dude, it just **** --
- ...My...God.

521
00:25:45.344 --> 00:25:48.445
Everybody please,
let's just give it a moment.

522
00:25:48.447 --> 00:25:50.047
my god...

523
00:25:50.049 --> 00:25:51.415
It makes your skin crawl.

524
00:25:51.417 --> 00:25:53.984
You literally want
to jump out of your own skin.

525
00:25:53.986 --> 00:25:55.386
My --

526
00:25:55.388 --> 00:25:58.155
Like, I hear the sound
with eric,

527
00:25:58.157 --> 00:25:59.623
And we both lost it
'cause it was literally --

528
00:25:59.625 --> 00:26:01.091
It felt like
the sound came through

529
00:26:01.093 --> 00:26:03.594
The side of my head
in between us.

530
00:26:03.596 --> 00:26:06.797
No, dude that was the
most disgusting sound
I've ever heard in my life.

531
00:26:06.799 --> 00:26:10.568
This thing truly sounds
terrifying.

532
00:26:13.105 --> 00:26:16.106
It's like sex.
It sounds just gross.

533
00:26:16.108 --> 00:26:18.042
Welcome to that
experience, man.

534
00:26:18.044 --> 00:26:20.244
This is actual, like, tracking

535
00:26:20.246 --> 00:26:22.846
For what the lady in white does.

536
00:26:22.848 --> 00:26:25.616
I've also been sitting
in there and heard a growl.

537
00:26:25.618 --> 00:26:29.620
Yes, which makes
my skin crawl even more.

538
00:26:29.622 --> 00:26:32.890
Part of her repertoire,
part of how she lets
people know she's there.

539
00:26:37.163 --> 00:26:39.630
From here on out,
we all stay together

540
00:26:39.632 --> 00:26:41.999
For the rest of the night,
we're together.

541
00:26:57.917 --> 00:26:59.783
After a sleepless night,

542
00:26:59.785 --> 00:27:02.620
Califf reaches out
to prior owners of conner house,

543
00:27:02.622 --> 00:27:06.090
Steve and cheryl stiebel,
to gather more information.

544
00:27:06.092 --> 00:27:08.826
So, tell me how the house
came into your life.

545
00:27:08.828 --> 00:27:11.061
My interest in the house
was to save it, to preserve it.

546
00:27:11.063 --> 00:27:13.864
It was in pretty sad shape
on the inside.

547
00:27:13.866 --> 00:27:16.000
Yeah, water was running
down the walls.

548
00:27:16.002 --> 00:27:18.569
When I was renovating,
I'd be working here by myself,

549
00:27:18.571 --> 00:27:20.037
And I would notice

550
00:27:20.039 --> 00:27:22.206
Somebody walk down the hall
on the second floor.

551
00:27:22.208 --> 00:27:23.574
What did this person
look like?

552
00:27:23.576 --> 00:27:26.777
I just seen like a shadow,
just a flash.

553
00:27:29.548 --> 00:27:31.315
Well,in paranormal theory,
what happens

554
00:27:31.317 --> 00:27:33.250
Is when you renovate a place
and you take away

555
00:27:33.252 --> 00:27:35.753
The look that the spirit
is used to,

556
00:27:35.755 --> 00:27:37.021
It actually rouses up activity

557
00:27:37.023 --> 00:27:40.090
And brings about more activity
in a more...

558
00:27:40.092 --> 00:27:41.592
Malevolent manner

559
00:27:41.594 --> 00:27:43.661
Because they're now in a place
they're not familiar with.

560
00:27:45.965 --> 00:27:49.066
Connie and susie also
did renovations to the home,

561
00:27:49.068 --> 00:27:51.402
Which could explain why
the activity has increased

562
00:27:51.404 --> 00:27:53.937
To manifest into a ghost loop.

563
00:27:53.939 --> 00:27:55.939
Do you believe
this place is haunted?

564
00:27:55.941 --> 00:27:57.374
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes.

565
00:27:59.278 --> 00:28:01.745
Based on our experiences.
Based on our experience,
it's haunted.

566
00:28:03.349 --> 00:28:05.749
There is also evidence
that those who were considered

567
00:28:05.751 --> 00:28:09.687
Undesirable members of society
were confined there

568
00:28:09.689 --> 00:28:12.956
During the home's time
as a boarding house.

569
00:28:12.958 --> 00:28:16.560
The room that is now
the en suite for the
new orleans room

570
00:28:16.562 --> 00:28:19.997
Was kept for undesirables.

571
00:28:19.999 --> 00:28:21.364
An unwed mother

572
00:28:21.366 --> 00:28:24.401
Or someone that had
a mental illness.

573
00:28:29.341 --> 00:28:33.343
Following this lead, califf
meets with counselor karen lundy

574
00:28:33.345 --> 00:28:36.780
To see how undesirables
were treated.

575
00:28:36.782 --> 00:28:38.415
Nowadays, it's a lot easier
to talk about.

576
00:28:38.417 --> 00:28:39.616
It's a lot more mainstream
to discuss

577
00:28:39.618 --> 00:28:40.784
Mental health
and those things.

578
00:28:40.786 --> 00:28:42.286
In the '50s,
was it that way?

579
00:28:42.288 --> 00:28:45.622
I would say there was still
a faction of people

580
00:28:45.624 --> 00:28:48.392
That were afraid
of the mentally ill.

581
00:28:48.394 --> 00:28:50.728
In the 1950s,
an unwed pregnant mother,

582
00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:51.895
Would that be somebody
that would fall

583
00:28:51.897 --> 00:28:53.130
In the realm
of undesirable?

584
00:28:53.132 --> 00:28:55.466
I think in the eyes of many,
it would've been.

585
00:28:55.468 --> 00:28:58.736
That was shameful
behavior.

586
00:28:58.738 --> 00:29:02.372
If the entity known as anna
was considered an undesirable,

587
00:29:02.374 --> 00:29:05.209
She may have been kept away
from the other boarders.

588
00:29:05.211 --> 00:29:06.877
Even in the 1950s,

589
00:29:06.879 --> 00:29:10.114
Unwed mothers were seen
as a detriment to society.

590
00:29:10.116 --> 00:29:11.749
They were often put in
similar situations

591
00:29:11.751 --> 00:29:13.684
As those who were considered
mentally ill...

592
00:29:18.557 --> 00:29:20.891
Let me go.

593
00:29:20.893 --> 00:29:23.427
...In conditions that
by today's standards

594
00:29:23.429 --> 00:29:26.663
Could only be described
as torturous.

595
00:29:26.665 --> 00:29:28.832
They were still practicing

596
00:29:28.834 --> 00:29:30.601
Some questionable types
of therapy

597
00:29:30.603 --> 00:29:33.103
Such as bed restraints,

598
00:29:33.105 --> 00:29:36.540
Straitjackets,
electroshock therapy,

599
00:29:36.542 --> 00:29:38.876
Things that weren't
necessarily helpful

600
00:29:38.878 --> 00:29:41.211
Or working for people.

601
00:29:41.213 --> 00:29:43.347
These treatments
could've been adopted

602
00:29:43.349 --> 00:29:45.149
To keep anna under control,

603
00:29:45.151 --> 00:29:46.750
Treatments that were
terrible enough

604
00:29:46.752 --> 00:29:49.153
To push the sane into madness.

605
00:29:53.125 --> 00:29:55.826
The team sits down
to figure out the game plan.

606
00:29:57.363 --> 00:29:58.829
There's certainly a lot
that's happened here,

607
00:29:58.831 --> 00:30:00.964
I think more so than initially
what we thought

608
00:30:00.966 --> 00:30:04.067
Before we arrived here
in illinois.

609
00:30:04.069 --> 00:30:05.269
There's actually
another name at play

610
00:30:05.271 --> 00:30:06.870
That we came up with.

611
00:30:09.408 --> 00:30:12.342
Anna is the woman considered
an undesirable

612
00:30:12.344 --> 00:30:13.343
Who was locked away.

613
00:30:13.345 --> 00:30:14.545
Is your name anna?

614
00:30:17.817 --> 00:30:20.184
And I got a female saying,
"I was imprisoned."

615
00:30:20.186 --> 00:30:21.785
Is this the room
they locked you in?

616
00:30:23.088 --> 00:30:24.521
- What the --
- it was here.

617
00:30:26.926 --> 00:30:29.660
The big thing only discusses
how mental health was treated

618
00:30:29.662 --> 00:30:31.228
And looked at
in the 1950s-kind of era

619
00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:32.896
For what we're dealing with.
You're gone.

620
00:30:32.898 --> 00:30:34.464
You are locked away.
You are shunned.

621
00:30:34.466 --> 00:30:35.866
Quarantined.
Yeah.

622
00:30:35.868 --> 00:30:38.936
Anna very well could've suffered
from mental illness

623
00:30:38.938 --> 00:30:41.305
Or was just an unwed mother
who went crazy

624
00:30:41.307 --> 00:30:43.674
Because of how she was treated.

625
00:30:43.676 --> 00:30:45.709
This was a boarding house,
and this is where

626
00:30:45.711 --> 00:30:47.611
A lot of these "undesirables"
were pushed

627
00:30:47.613 --> 00:30:49.246
And forced to be suffering

628
00:30:49.248 --> 00:30:51.114
In all sorts of mental,
psychological,

629
00:30:51.116 --> 00:30:53.784
And emotional situations
that they had no control over.

630
00:30:53.786 --> 00:30:55.652
Who do you think anna is?

631
00:30:55.654 --> 00:30:57.454
I think anna
is the lady in white.

632
00:30:59.892 --> 00:31:02.826
Every single experience
that we have had,

633
00:31:02.828 --> 00:31:04.228
Where does it lead to?

634
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:05.829
The attic.

635
00:31:05.831 --> 00:31:07.865
The lady in white escaped
from her room

636
00:31:07.867 --> 00:31:10.534
And ran to the attic
to kill herself.

637
00:31:10.536 --> 00:31:13.103
Absolutely, and that's
obviously why we all thought

638
00:31:13.105 --> 00:31:15.305
We have to build this trigger
environment in the attic,

639
00:31:15.307 --> 00:31:17.641
Whatever is necessary
that we have to do as a team

640
00:31:17.643 --> 00:31:18.876
To build
these trigger environments

641
00:31:18.878 --> 00:31:21.445
To help the families
we get involved with.

642
00:31:21.447 --> 00:31:24.214
And most importantly,
I think that we need to help

643
00:31:24.216 --> 00:31:28.285
This lady in white, anna,
to find peace.

644
00:31:28.287 --> 00:31:32.256
It's gonna be the most elaborate
trigger environment to date.

645
00:31:34.994 --> 00:31:37.728
For this trigger
environment,

646
00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:40.264
I'm going to transform the attic

647
00:31:40.266 --> 00:31:42.733
Into one of
the undesirable rooms

648
00:31:42.735 --> 00:31:43.834
Anna was kept in.

649
00:31:45.638 --> 00:31:48.839
I got straight jackets
and bed restraints

650
00:31:48.841 --> 00:31:50.641
From anna's day.

651
00:31:50.643 --> 00:31:53.410
I got a wheelchair
she could've been bound to.

652
00:31:53.412 --> 00:31:54.878
It breaks my heart

653
00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.047
To know that a young woman

654
00:31:57.049 --> 00:31:59.883
Lives her life like this.

655
00:31:59.885 --> 00:32:04.321
Anna is there somebody here
hat's trapping you?

656
00:32:04.323 --> 00:32:05.322
Get me out.

657
00:32:05.324 --> 00:32:07.024
My god, dude!

658
00:32:07.026 --> 00:32:08.659
- Holy --
- where's the knife?

659
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:20.637
The spirit hunters have
discovered the ghost loop

660
00:32:20.639 --> 00:32:23.307
Threatening connie, susie,
and their customers

661
00:32:23.309 --> 00:32:24.574
At the bed and breakfast

662
00:32:24.576 --> 00:32:26.476
Is a woman named anna.

663
00:32:29.348 --> 00:32:31.648
When the bed and breakfast
was a boarding house,

664
00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:33.583
Anna was confined to her room

665
00:32:33.585 --> 00:32:35.285
Where she suffered
terrible abuse.

666
00:32:37.523 --> 00:32:40.257
Now, eric has created
a trigger environment

667
00:32:40.259 --> 00:32:42.726
Replicating the horror
anna was subjected to.

668
00:32:43.762 --> 00:32:45.062
You know, it makes me sad

669
00:32:45.064 --> 00:32:47.965
That this woman
was held captive here

670
00:32:47.967 --> 00:32:49.533
Against her will

671
00:32:49.535 --> 00:32:51.835
And in shackles, restraints.

672
00:32:51.837 --> 00:32:54.338
I mean, that's a terrible way
to live.

673
00:32:56.742 --> 00:32:58.442
With the cameras set,

674
00:32:58.444 --> 00:32:59.843
The team takes their place

675
00:32:59.845 --> 00:33:02.212
Within this
disturbing environment.

676
00:33:05.017 --> 00:33:08.051
The ultimate hope
is to relate

677
00:33:08.053 --> 00:33:09.720
To the woman in white...

678
00:33:09.722 --> 00:33:11.421
man...

679
00:33:11.423 --> 00:33:13.523
...To let her know
that we're here.

680
00:33:13.525 --> 00:33:16.360
We're there during those events
that she endured

681
00:33:16.362 --> 00:33:18.562
So this way we can really
have her connect with us,

682
00:33:18.564 --> 00:33:21.832
Communicate with us and,
ultimately, listen to us

683
00:33:21.834 --> 00:33:24.434
So we can send her into light
and find peace.

684
00:33:24.436 --> 00:33:25.802
How we feeling brother?

685
00:33:25.804 --> 00:33:29.072
Can't imagine being stuck
in one of these things.

686
00:33:29.074 --> 00:33:30.273
I'm helpless.

687
00:33:30.275 --> 00:33:31.608
I'm agitated.

688
00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:36.480
I'm basically
using myself as bait.

689
00:33:36.482 --> 00:33:37.714
god,

690
00:33:37.716 --> 00:33:39.983
I really don't want to be
doing this right now.

691
00:33:39.985 --> 00:33:41.718
You want to switch?

692
00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.854
No.
- I honestly don't want to be

693
00:33:43.856 --> 00:33:46.056
In this attic right now.

694
00:33:46.058 --> 00:33:48.725
I don't want to be
shackled up to a bed,

695
00:33:48.727 --> 00:33:50.360
But I have to show
this lady in white

696
00:33:50.362 --> 00:33:52.029
That I understand
what she went through.

697
00:33:53.699 --> 00:33:55.799
I'm putting
the phasma box on

698
00:33:55.801 --> 00:33:58.468
To hear what it's trying
to say to us.

699
00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:59.970
And then I'm using
the sls cam

700
00:33:59.972 --> 00:34:03.340
To see
where the spirit is.

701
00:34:03.342 --> 00:34:05.909
Whose bed
are you nearby, anna?

702
00:34:05.911 --> 00:34:08.011
Say their name
or put one of the devices --

703
00:34:08.013 --> 00:34:09.179
Turn them on.

704
00:34:19.992 --> 00:34:21.291
That's going crazy.

705
00:34:24.129 --> 00:34:26.430
- I'm 28?
- I'm 28.
- I'm 28?

706
00:34:26.432 --> 00:34:27.464
She's 28.
-28?

707
00:34:27.466 --> 00:34:29.499
I'm literally gonna be 28...

708
00:34:29.501 --> 00:34:31.435
- Wow.
- ...In less than a month.

709
00:34:31.437 --> 00:34:33.437
You were 28 when you died?

710
00:34:33.439 --> 00:34:35.338
Is that why you were
relating to kris.

711
00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:36.940
My god...

712
00:34:36.942 --> 00:34:38.375
Anna and I are both 28.

713
00:34:38.377 --> 00:34:39.743
She feels a connection to me,

714
00:34:39.745 --> 00:34:42.279
And I also feel
a connection to her.

715
00:34:42.281 --> 00:34:44.614
And I know that she's trying
to communicate with me.

716
00:34:44.616 --> 00:34:46.750
Anna were you
an unwed mother?

717
00:34:50.289 --> 00:34:51.721
Wow.

718
00:34:51.723 --> 00:34:53.690
Can you appear
next to kris's bed

719
00:34:53.692 --> 00:34:55.559
So we can see you?
Op!

720
00:34:55.561 --> 00:34:58.895
It was right over kris's bed,
right over her head.

721
00:34:58.897 --> 00:35:01.765
I saw the stick figure
show up right next to her bed

722
00:35:01.767 --> 00:35:04.101
And it looked as if it was
reaching out for her head.

723
00:35:08.674 --> 00:35:10.474
Is that how you
were shackled in bed?

724
00:35:13.712 --> 00:35:15.011
- Get me out.
- Get me out.

725
00:35:15.013 --> 00:35:17.114
- It's saying, "get me out."
- wow.

726
00:35:17.116 --> 00:35:21.585
Ultimate hope is to relate
to the woman in white,

727
00:35:21.587 --> 00:35:24.087
To let her know that we're there
during those events

728
00:35:24.089 --> 00:35:25.422
That she endured.

729
00:35:25.424 --> 00:35:26.590
Eric, are you okay?

730
00:35:26.592 --> 00:35:28.458
Can you appear
and confirm with us

731
00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:30.594
If you had a baby?

732
00:35:30.596 --> 00:35:32.562
You were pregnant.

733
00:35:32.564 --> 00:35:34.764
My god, dude.

734
00:35:34.766 --> 00:35:36.733
Is it my bed?
Yes.
Yep.

735
00:35:36.735 --> 00:35:38.602
Anna do you feel
a connection with me

736
00:35:38.604 --> 00:35:42.606
Because I'm around
the same age as you?

737
00:35:42.608 --> 00:35:44.875
my god.
They just went off --

738
00:35:44.877 --> 00:35:46.710
The both of them
at the same time.
My god.

739
00:35:46.712 --> 00:35:47.911
Literally in sync.

740
00:35:52.084 --> 00:35:53.517
We got whipped.

741
00:35:53.519 --> 00:35:55.652
- We got whipped!
- We got whipped.

742
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:59.589
Where you beat, anna?

743
00:35:59.591 --> 00:36:02.792
Did they beat you here?

744
00:36:02.794 --> 00:36:04.127
Both of them.

745
00:36:04.129 --> 00:36:05.996
These things are going off
at the same time.

746
00:36:05.998 --> 00:36:08.331
Do you know many
times this has done
this? This is crazy.
Never.

747
00:36:08.333 --> 00:36:10.667
I've never seen this before.

748
00:36:10.669 --> 00:36:14.104
Anna, I hate to ask this.

749
00:36:14.106 --> 00:36:15.739
Did you hang yourself?

750
00:36:19.878 --> 00:36:21.478
there you go.

751
00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.079
Both of them went off
at the same time.

752
00:36:23.081 --> 00:36:24.347
My gosh.

753
00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:27.450
She took her
own life in this attic.

754
00:36:27.452 --> 00:36:29.186
This confirms
that the ghost loop

755
00:36:29.188 --> 00:36:32.722
Is anna escaping
from the undesirable room

756
00:36:32.724 --> 00:36:35.292
And fleeing to the attic
to commit suicide.

757
00:36:37.296 --> 00:36:38.361
- Help!
- She just said help!

758
00:36:38.363 --> 00:36:40.063
She just said help.
My god.

759
00:36:40.065 --> 00:36:41.565
Guys, we have to help her.

760
00:36:41.567 --> 00:36:43.333
Let's get you
out of the restraints.

761
00:36:43.335 --> 00:36:44.834
How am I gonna
get my foot out?

762
00:36:44.836 --> 00:36:48.038
I know that anna
felt the need to escape

763
00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:50.640
Because all I want to do
is bolt out of there.

764
00:36:54.346 --> 00:36:56.079
The emotion of the situation

765
00:36:56.081 --> 00:36:58.081
Suddenly overwhelms califf.

766
00:36:58.083 --> 00:37:00.417
At this point,
my mind is pretty well blank.

767
00:37:00.419 --> 00:37:02.652
I can't breathe,
I can't really function...

768
00:37:04.456 --> 00:37:06.756
...And I just have to get out.
I have to get out.

769
00:37:17.035 --> 00:37:20.237
The spirit hunters have placed
themselves in the same situation

770
00:37:20.239 --> 00:37:22.572
The ghost loop would've endured

771
00:37:22.574 --> 00:37:25.308
In order to gain her trust.

772
00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:27.978
I don't want to be
shackled up to a bed,

773
00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:29.713
But I have to show
this lady in a white

774
00:37:29.715 --> 00:37:31.314
That I understand
what she went through.

775
00:37:32.884 --> 00:37:34.017
- Get me out.
- Get me out.

776
00:37:34.019 --> 00:37:35.752
It said, "get me out."
- wow.

777
00:37:35.754 --> 00:37:37.053
How am I gonna get
my foot out?

778
00:37:37.055 --> 00:37:38.121
Where's the knife?

779
00:37:38.123 --> 00:37:39.689
After connecting with kris,

780
00:37:39.691 --> 00:37:43.260
Anna's torment
hits home with califf.

781
00:37:43.262 --> 00:37:45.795
At this point,
my mind is pretty well blank.

782
00:37:45.797 --> 00:37:47.931
I can't breathe,
I can't really function...

783
00:37:49.768 --> 00:37:52.168
...And I just have to get out.
I have to get out.

784
00:38:00.112 --> 00:38:01.278
I'm okay.

785
00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.647
Yeah, I'm okay.

786
00:38:07.619 --> 00:38:09.886
I mean, we literally put
ourselves in the same positions

787
00:38:09.888 --> 00:38:11.721
That they were in at that time.

788
00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:18.194
I don't really have words, but
it hit a chord in me emotionally

789
00:38:18.196 --> 00:38:20.530
Because, you know, I've lost
people that I love to suicide.

790
00:38:22.534 --> 00:38:23.933
But, I mean, at the end
of the day, we all do

791
00:38:23.935 --> 00:38:26.603
What we have to do
to get things done.

792
00:38:26.605 --> 00:38:28.505
As califf rejoins the team,

793
00:38:28.507 --> 00:38:31.641
Sean and kris begin
to cross the spirit over.

794
00:38:33.045 --> 00:38:35.979
Anna, are you with us?

795
00:38:35.981 --> 00:38:37.781
I'm here.
I'm here.

796
00:38:37.783 --> 00:38:39.683
Anna, you shouldn't
be here.

797
00:38:39.685 --> 00:38:42.185
You died too soon.
We acknowledge that.

798
00:38:42.187 --> 00:38:45.455
We understand
what happened to you.

799
00:38:45.457 --> 00:38:47.123
It is time to let go.

800
00:38:49.227 --> 00:38:50.694
Whatever you went through
in life

801
00:38:50.696 --> 00:38:52.529
You have to let go of it.

802
00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:56.199
Said, "return."
- "return?"

803
00:38:56.201 --> 00:38:58.368
Good.
- Return home!

804
00:38:58.370 --> 00:39:00.203
You're spiritual being of light

805
00:39:00.205 --> 00:39:02.072
That needs to return
to the light.

806
00:39:02.074 --> 00:39:04.941
Anna, do you see
the light?

807
00:39:04.943 --> 00:39:07.410
You didn't deserve
to die when you did.

808
00:39:07.412 --> 00:39:09.779
You don't belong here
anymore.

809
00:39:09.781 --> 00:39:11.114
I ask you, archangel michael,

810
00:39:11.116 --> 00:39:13.316
To bring forth the white light
of the holy ghost

811
00:39:13.318 --> 00:39:16.686
And let anna find the true peace
she deserves.

812
00:39:16.688 --> 00:39:18.521
We understand
what you went through.

813
00:39:18.523 --> 00:39:21.358
I laid in that bed.
You have to find the light.

814
00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:22.992
I know that you can see it.

815
00:39:24.963 --> 00:39:25.829
Safer!

816
00:39:25.831 --> 00:39:27.197
- Safer.
- Safer.

817
00:39:27.199 --> 00:39:29.099
It did say,
"the light -- safer."

818
00:39:29.101 --> 00:39:32.836
That's what it said.
The light -- safer.

819
00:39:32.838 --> 00:39:35.071
Will you return to the light?

820
00:39:40.278 --> 00:39:42.779
Anna, please.
You have to go.

821
00:39:46.251 --> 00:39:47.617
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

822
00:39:47.619 --> 00:39:50.387
Thanks. Female said thanks.
Thanks. She said thanks.

823
00:39:50.389 --> 00:39:51.721
Wow.

824
00:39:52.924 --> 00:39:55.558
Dude, it literally said,
"the light -- safer."

825
00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.127
Doesn't feel
like that threatening voice

826
00:39:57.129 --> 00:39:58.495
That we've caught
this whole time.
No.

827
00:39:58.497 --> 00:40:01.631
And it got so quiet.

828
00:40:01.633 --> 00:40:03.099
- Yeah.
- Are you good?

829
00:40:03.101 --> 00:40:04.634
I'm good.

830
00:40:04.636 --> 00:40:07.137
You, like, have a glowing aura
around you.

831
00:40:07.139 --> 00:40:08.638
Like, you were almost...

832
00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.408
Her, you know.

833
00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:15.078
Like, I can cry
but not because I'm sad --

834
00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.647
Because I'm just so happy.
- It's a good feeling.

835
00:40:17.649 --> 00:40:20.116
I mean, she was trapped here
for a long time and...

836
00:40:20.118 --> 00:40:21.684
I mean, she's gone.

837
00:40:21.686 --> 00:40:24.888
This is the most
emotional crossing over

838
00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:27.023
I've ever been a part of.

839
00:40:27.025 --> 00:40:28.491
Good work.

840
00:40:28.493 --> 00:40:31.261
Let's bless this place.
- Yeah.

841
00:40:31.263 --> 00:40:32.695
It was beautiful.

842
00:40:32.697 --> 00:40:35.231
That commands you
and all spirits of any kind

843
00:40:35.233 --> 00:40:37.534
To harmlessly depart.

844
00:40:37.536 --> 00:40:41.604
That was...An experience
I'll never forget.

845
00:40:41.606 --> 00:40:43.840
It wasn't just empathizing
for the spirit.

846
00:40:43.842 --> 00:40:45.341
It was being there with her.

847
00:40:47.879 --> 00:40:49.846
This whole investigation

848
00:40:49.848 --> 00:40:53.049
Was probably
the toughest one we've done.

849
00:40:53.051 --> 00:40:54.918
If anna walked into
the room right now,

850
00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:57.120
The first thing to come out of
my mouth is, "I'm sorry.

851
00:40:57.122 --> 00:40:59.022
I'm sorry that we
as human beings failed you.

852
00:40:59.024 --> 00:41:02.258
I'm sorry that we as people
treated you like an animal

853
00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:03.760
And caged you instead
of doing what was right

854
00:41:03.762 --> 00:41:05.094
And trying to help you.

855
00:41:05.096 --> 00:41:07.997
You deserve better
from us as people,

856
00:41:07.999 --> 00:41:10.400
And you deserve better
from this world and this life."

857
00:41:14.139 --> 00:41:17.740
Hey, ladies.
Hey.
Hi.

858
00:41:17.742 --> 00:41:19.042
I'm dying to know
what happened.

859
00:41:19.044 --> 00:41:21.344
Did you find out anything?
- We actually found out

860
00:41:21.346 --> 00:41:23.746
And got substantial evidence
that this lady in white,

861
00:41:23.748 --> 00:41:25.181
Her name was anna,

862
00:41:25.183 --> 00:41:27.951
And she was
imprisoned in this home

863
00:41:27.953 --> 00:41:30.019
Back when it was
a boarding home.

864
00:41:30.021 --> 00:41:32.489
We were able to communicate
with her and convince her

865
00:41:32.491 --> 00:41:34.390
To find the peace
that she deserves.

866
00:41:34.392 --> 00:41:36.426
You could feel it.
All of us can feel her

867
00:41:36.428 --> 00:41:38.661
Letting go
and finding the light.

868
00:41:38.663 --> 00:41:40.296
Well, we really
