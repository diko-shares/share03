1
00:00:06.073 --> 00:00:08.540
What the **** was that?

2
00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:10.142
You alright?

3
00:00:10.144 --> 00:00:12.411
What happened?

4
00:00:12.413 --> 00:00:15.347
**** that. Nope.
Nope, nope, nope.

5
00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:16.982
What is it?

6
00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:19.284
Holy ****.

7
00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:21.687
Crazy-ass ****
is happening down here.

8
00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.856
We're coming right now.

9
00:00:23.858 --> 00:00:27.393
They are the spirit hunters.

10
00:00:27.395 --> 00:00:29.395
I feel something
behind me.

11
00:00:29.397 --> 00:00:31.964
They are who people call
when they are tormented

12
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:35.300
By entities that circled back,
night after night.

13
00:00:35.302 --> 00:00:38.137
Entities bent on destroying
the lives of the living.

14
00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:41.206
Holy!
Does this look
like the night

15
00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:42.408
That you were murdered?

16
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.676
These spirits
are often trapped,

17
00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:48.947
Repeating the same trauma
over and over.

18
00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:51.617
The mission of the spirit
hunters is to help the living

19
00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:58.157
By breaking the cycle
of the ghost loop.

20
00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:00.959
The spirit hunters
are in palatka, florida.

21
00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:04.830
It's a small town in the north
central part of the state,

22
00:01:04.832 --> 00:01:07.900
About 100 miles
north of orlando.

23
00:01:07.902 --> 00:01:10.035
Theresa has called
the team for help

24
00:01:10.037 --> 00:01:12.237
With a ghost loop haunting

25
00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:15.007
That has terrorized
her whole family.

26
00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.845
I see her crawling out of one
bedroom, through the hallway,

27
00:01:19.847 --> 00:01:22.414
Up the ceiling,
into the other bedroom.

28
00:01:25.186 --> 00:01:26.785
It keeps coming back.

29
00:01:31.392 --> 00:01:33.859
Theresa has lived on
this 22-acre plot of land

30
00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:35.928
All her life,

31
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.463
Which has been handed down
in the family

32
00:01:37.465 --> 00:01:39.765
Throughout the generations.

33
00:01:39.767 --> 00:01:42.701
Total shift of energy once
we drove in here, right, guys?

34
00:01:42.703 --> 00:01:45.003
Theresa reports
being repeatedly visited

35
00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:46.505
By a female entity

36
00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:50.576
Who terrorizes her family
on a nightly basis.

37
00:01:50.578 --> 00:01:54.313
This place is probably
really creepy at night.
Yeah.

38
00:01:54.315 --> 00:01:57.516
We're on a mission to help
any individuals

39
00:01:57.518 --> 00:01:59.051
In the country
that are experiencing

40
00:01:59.053 --> 00:02:01.086
Any sort of negative energy,
where they don't feel like

41
00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:03.122
They're safe in their home.

42
00:02:03.124 --> 00:02:07.726
What theresa's experiencing is a
ghost loop.

43
00:02:07.728 --> 00:02:10.696
And the spirit hunters
are here to break that loop.

44
00:02:10.698 --> 00:02:14.032
But before they do,
kris and sean want to hear

45
00:02:14.034 --> 00:02:16.401
Theresa's story firsthand.

46
00:02:16.403 --> 00:02:18.103
So I know we've talked
on the phone.

47
00:02:18.105 --> 00:02:20.005
Can you go into, like,
description

48
00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:23.342
Of exactly what you've been
seeing and experiencing?

49
00:02:23.344 --> 00:02:26.044
When I see her,
she's in one end of the house,

50
00:02:26.046 --> 00:02:27.779
Which is the hallway.

51
00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:31.150
And she'll come out
from my boy's bedroom,

52
00:02:31.152 --> 00:02:33.152
Crawling on the ceiling...

53
00:02:35.523 --> 00:02:40.692
...And then into my other son's
room, over and over again.

54
00:02:45.466 --> 00:02:46.798
Crawling around...
Yes.

55
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.501
...Over and over again
through the hallway.
Absolutely.

56
00:02:49.503 --> 00:02:52.070
When I walk into a room,
I can feel the energy,

57
00:02:52.072 --> 00:02:54.840
And there's definitely
a negative presence there.

58
00:02:54.842 --> 00:03:02.781
Her skin is, like, disfigured,
gray, just matted long hair,

59
00:03:02.783 --> 00:03:07.519
And it's black and it's dirty,
and it's very frightening.

60
00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:08.887
How long has it been?

61
00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:11.823
It's been about, um...

62
00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:13.825
Over five years.

63
00:03:13.827 --> 00:03:16.728
Wow.
So a really long time.
Really,
really long time.

64
00:03:18.766 --> 00:03:21.733
The entity appears
in her younger son's bedroom,

65
00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:24.770
Crawls across the ceiling...

66
00:03:24.772 --> 00:03:27.573
And into her eldest son's room.

67
00:03:27.575 --> 00:03:31.276
And as a mother,
knowing that something is going

68
00:03:31.278 --> 00:03:35.747
From one of your son's bedroom
to another son's bedroom is...

69
00:03:36.917 --> 00:03:38.850
...Y-you just --
it terrifies you

70
00:03:38.852 --> 00:03:40.285
And you just don't know
what to do.

71
00:03:40.287 --> 00:03:43.789
And you can't really talk
to people about it.

72
00:03:43.791 --> 00:03:46.124
I know that this is a pretty
massive property.

73
00:03:46.126 --> 00:03:48.060
What are some of the things
that has happened here,

74
00:03:48.062 --> 00:03:50.195
That you're aware of?
History-wise.

75
00:03:50.197 --> 00:03:52.497
My grandmother said that there
are multiple

76
00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:56.635
Stillborn babies
buried out here.

77
00:03:56.637 --> 00:04:01.206
In the early 20th century,
stillborn deaths were common.

78
00:04:01.208 --> 00:04:03.609
Those stillborns
went unregistered

79
00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:05.444
Because the poor families
of the area

80
00:04:05.446 --> 00:04:08.046
Couldn't afford to pay
for both the birth and death

81
00:04:08.048 --> 00:04:12.517
Certificates that were required,
due to an 1874 law.

82
00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.019
That meant women
were often forced

83
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:16.555
To bury their stillborns
in wooded areas,

84
00:04:16.557 --> 00:04:20.058
In secret,
under the cover of night.

85
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.196
We lived in another part of
this property in a mobile home,

86
00:04:24.198 --> 00:04:26.098
While we were waiting
to build this house.

87
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.233
And we would hear a baby cry.

88
00:04:28.235 --> 00:04:30.569
Actually where I was living,

89
00:04:30.571 --> 00:04:33.472
Just a few feet from that
is where I was told

90
00:04:33.474 --> 00:04:35.407
That they were buried.

91
00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:38.677
How has this ghost loop affected
your life with your family,

92
00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:40.078
Your friends?

93
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.147
So I don't have people over.

94
00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:45.951
My grandchildren can't even come
over and stay with me anymore.

95
00:04:45.953 --> 00:04:48.353
What if it tried
to harm somebody?

96
00:04:48.355 --> 00:04:51.957
I want my house back,
I want my family back.

97
00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:54.593
I'm ready to get some help
and I'm ready to put this

98
00:04:54.595 --> 00:04:58.196
All behind me
and move on with my life.

99
00:04:58.198 --> 00:04:59.865
Yeah. Theresa,
we're here for you.

100
00:05:04.438 --> 00:05:07.105
The team splits up for
the preliminary investigation

101
00:05:07.107 --> 00:05:09.308
Of theresa's massive property.

102
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.844
Kris, matt, and califf
will investigate

103
00:05:12.846 --> 00:05:14.479
The site of the ghost loop.

104
00:05:17.251 --> 00:05:21.286
Meanwhile, sean and eric go
to the stillborn burial grounds.

105
00:05:21.288 --> 00:05:23.722
They follow the hunch
that the loop is connected

106
00:05:23.724 --> 00:05:26.458
To a stillborn buried here.

107
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.293
There's been a lot of things
that have happened

108
00:05:28.295 --> 00:05:29.561
In that hallway.

109
00:05:29.563 --> 00:05:31.496
She's seen, like,
a decrepit lady.

110
00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:33.265
What are you thinking?
Pull an evp session real quick?

111
00:05:33.267 --> 00:05:34.733
Yeah.

112
00:05:34.735 --> 00:05:36.601
Alright, were doing
an evp session right now

113
00:05:36.603 --> 00:05:38.337
In theresa's house.

114
00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:39.604
Is there anybody here
tonight,

115
00:05:39.606 --> 00:05:41.306
That would like
to speak with us?

116
00:05:43.277 --> 00:05:46.678
If anyone is here,
can you show us a sign?

117
00:05:49.283 --> 00:05:51.650
I keep looking in that hallway.
I don't know why.

118
00:05:51.652 --> 00:05:53.385
Well, I'm looking up there
right now

119
00:05:53.387 --> 00:05:56.388
And I could have sworn
I saw something shift.

120
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.422
It almost looked like the
speaker moved,

121
00:05:57.424 --> 00:05:58.523
Because it's so black.

122
00:05:58.525 --> 00:05:59.725
So I don't know if
I'm actually seeing

123
00:05:59.727 --> 00:06:01.827
A ball of black energy.

124
00:06:01.829 --> 00:06:04.363
Yeah. Still rolling
on the recorder.

125
00:06:04.365 --> 00:06:06.264
It looked like a shift.

126
00:06:06.266 --> 00:06:08.133
Like this thing
right here just moved.

127
00:06:08.135 --> 00:06:11.636
Is that the sign?
Did you show us that sign?

128
00:06:18.912 --> 00:06:20.946
Hey, kris.

129
00:06:20.948 --> 00:06:23.682
Kris, matt,
and califf enter the room

130
00:06:23.684 --> 00:06:25.217
Where the ghost loop begins.

131
00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:28.186
The entire time you guys
were out there,

132
00:06:28.188 --> 00:06:29.755
In here there's been
pops and creaks

133
00:06:29.757 --> 00:06:31.723
And all types of stuff.
Okay.

134
00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:33.091
There's something
happening here and --

135
00:06:33.093 --> 00:06:35.293
Do you feel that?
That's the energy.

136
00:06:35.295 --> 00:06:36.528
Do you feel tense?
Because I feel super tense.

137
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.896
Yeah. I walked in here
in chills.

138
00:06:37.898 --> 00:06:41.066
You have chills and it's obvious
that you can feel that.

139
00:06:41.068 --> 00:06:43.101
Yeah.
Where do you feel worst?

140
00:06:43.103 --> 00:06:44.403
Here.
Towards the back?

141
00:06:44.405 --> 00:06:46.104
Back closet?

142
00:06:46.106 --> 00:06:48.607
Do you have a light?
What do you feel?

143
00:06:48.609 --> 00:06:50.208
God, dude, that is like...

144
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.878
My gosh, guys.

145
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.679
There's definitely
something here.

146
00:06:54.681 --> 00:06:57.616
At the same time,
sean and eric

147
00:06:57.618 --> 00:07:00.085
Travel to the stillborn
burial grounds.

148
00:07:02.456 --> 00:07:03.522
Immediately
we were walking up,

149
00:07:03.524 --> 00:07:04.756
I felt pressure on my chest.

150
00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:06.258
It was as if I couldn't
breathe for a second.

151
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.693
I'm going to bring
a phasma box out in this.

152
00:07:08.695 --> 00:07:12.230
A phasma box is a database
of sound samples

153
00:07:12.232 --> 00:07:14.633
That these spirits
can manipulate into words.

154
00:07:14.635 --> 00:07:16.268
And see if we can get
some confirmations

155
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.471
That could be linked to what's
going on in theresa home.

156
00:07:19.473 --> 00:07:22.174
Okay. Sounds good.

157
00:07:22.176 --> 00:07:25.010
If there's any energies here,
we appreciate

158
00:07:25.012 --> 00:07:29.114
If you come forward and speak
with us, use these devices.

159
00:07:29.116 --> 00:07:31.616
Talk to me,
I'm sensitive to your energy.

160
00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:34.119
So we can figure out
what happened to you.

161
00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:36.021
Definitely got a creepy vibe
down here, man.

162
00:07:44.131 --> 00:07:45.897
How close are we to --

163
00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:49.801
Watching?
Are you watching us?

164
00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:52.304
How close are we to where
the babies are buried?

165
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.876
Am I standing near it?

166
00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:07.085
Did it say,
"that was my son"?

167
00:08:07.087 --> 00:08:09.588
It sounded like,
"that was my son."

168
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.723
Did you lose a son?

169
00:08:13.694 --> 00:08:15.927
"I did,"
in a female voice.

170
00:08:15.929 --> 00:08:17.529
My god. Wow.

171
00:08:17.531 --> 00:08:20.031
I got chills, because
that's been my impression.

172
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.470
Are you hearing
something?

173
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:40.018
Something creeping up
behind sean?

174
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.386
Something's moving.

175
00:08:44.525 --> 00:08:46.958
Dude, did you ****
just hear that?

176
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.027
What happened?
I just heard
a **** kid.

177
00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:50.962
I just heard a baby noise.
You heard a
disembodied voice?

178
00:08:50.964 --> 00:08:53.431
Disembodied,
I **** you not.

179
00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:05.610
The spirit hunters
are in palatka, florida,

180
00:09:05.612 --> 00:09:07.312
Investigating a ghost loop

181
00:09:07.314 --> 00:09:12.217
Terrorizing local residents,
theresa, and her family.

182
00:09:12.219 --> 00:09:14.619
Night after night,
the spirit emerges

183
00:09:14.621 --> 00:09:16.922
From theresa's
youngest son's room,

184
00:09:16.924 --> 00:09:21.526
Crawls along the ceiling to then
enter her eldest son's room.

185
00:09:21.528 --> 00:09:23.395
The team has split up
to perform

186
00:09:23.397 --> 00:09:26.331
A preliminary investigation
of the property.

187
00:09:26.333 --> 00:09:30.435
While eric and sean investigate
the stillborn burial grounds.

188
00:09:30.437 --> 00:09:33.071
Dude, did you
**** just hear that?

189
00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:35.040
What happened?
I just heard
a **** kid.

190
00:09:35.042 --> 00:09:37.375
What is this?

191
00:09:37.377 --> 00:09:39.444
Kris, matt, and califf

192
00:09:39.446 --> 00:09:41.813
Investigate the scene
of the ghost loop.

193
00:09:41.815 --> 00:09:43.648
This closet is what I was
drawn to first.

194
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:44.883
Really?
What is this?

195
00:09:44.885 --> 00:09:47.752
Why are there holes
in the wall?

196
00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:50.488
She did mention that her sons
made the holes in the walls.

197
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.223
She said that it was
kind of out of anger,

198
00:09:52.225 --> 00:09:54.025
So I'm just wondering
if something

199
00:09:54.027 --> 00:09:56.294
Provoked their energy.
Look at this.

200
00:09:56.296 --> 00:09:59.130
Often the young are targeted
by aggressive spirits,

201
00:09:59.132 --> 00:10:01.266
Because they are closer
to the spirit world.

202
00:10:01.268 --> 00:10:04.002
This can lead to the child
embodying the spirits

203
00:10:04.004 --> 00:10:05.837
And their negative energy.

204
00:10:05.839 --> 00:10:10.442
My thought right now is that
this thing is still hiding.

205
00:10:13.246 --> 00:10:15.180
While kris, matt, and califf

206
00:10:15.182 --> 00:10:17.215
Are investigating the house,

207
00:10:17.217 --> 00:10:20.819
Sean and eric are at
the stillborn burial grounds.

208
00:10:20.821 --> 00:10:22.921
I just heard a **** kid.
I just heard a baby noise.

209
00:10:22.923 --> 00:10:24.322
You just heard
a disembodied voice?

210
00:10:24.324 --> 00:10:26.157
Disembodied.

211
00:10:26.159 --> 00:10:27.892
It wasn't like a baby cry.

212
00:10:27.894 --> 00:10:30.495
It was like a baby noise,
like a little humming.

213
00:10:30.497 --> 00:10:33.732
Recording a disembodied voice
one can hear with a human ear,

214
00:10:33.734 --> 00:10:36.501
Is considered a class
a voice phenomenon,

215
00:10:36.503 --> 00:10:39.604
Which means this spirit
has incredible energy.

216
00:10:44.344 --> 00:10:46.444
Are you trying
to get our attention?

217
00:10:53.654 --> 00:10:55.687
The phasma box goes quiet,

218
00:10:55.689 --> 00:10:58.657
So eric and sean expand
their investigation area.

219
00:11:05.499 --> 00:11:07.232
Did that just say "eric"?

220
00:11:07.234 --> 00:11:08.900
Did you just say my name?

221
00:11:13.407 --> 00:11:15.507
Why don't you try doing
a spirit box session?

222
00:11:21.648 --> 00:11:23.948
Alright.

223
00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.418
Anyone here
want to communicate with us?

224
00:11:29.256 --> 00:11:31.356
Sean just heard
little baby cries.

225
00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:33.224
That you trying
to get our attention?

226
00:11:35.395 --> 00:11:39.164
Something here is just draining
the batteries in the spirit box.

227
00:11:45.505 --> 00:11:48.973
Gone forever.
Gone forever. My god.

228
00:11:48.975 --> 00:11:51.309
If we go back to the baby
grave site,

229
00:11:51.311 --> 00:11:54.312
Will you point to where
they're buried for us?

230
00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:00.618
Yes.
Yes. Let's go.
Let's go.

231
00:12:04.491 --> 00:12:08.093
This room feels gross,
like heavy and gross.

232
00:12:08.095 --> 00:12:10.462
As soon as I walked in,
my heart started to race

233
00:12:10.464 --> 00:12:14.099
And I can feel coldness
in my arms.

234
00:12:14.101 --> 00:12:17.168
Well, what do
you want to do?

235
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.237
I think I need
a few minutes in here.

236
00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:21.906
By yourself?
By myself.

237
00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:23.108
Whatever you need.

238
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.577
I'm good. I'm good.
Let's do it.

239
00:12:25.579 --> 00:12:28.279
Being an empath,
kris knows she can summon

240
00:12:28.281 --> 00:12:31.116
The entity more easily
if she isolates herself

241
00:12:31.118 --> 00:12:32.817
From the rest of the team.

242
00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:34.119
I'm going
to grab a walkie...
Okay.

243
00:12:34.121 --> 00:12:35.386
...And then we'll have one
out there too.

244
00:12:35.388 --> 00:12:36.955
So if anything happens,

245
00:12:36.957 --> 00:12:39.057
We're watching you
and we can hear you.
Okay.

246
00:12:39.059 --> 00:12:41.960
Okay?
Yeah.

247
00:12:41.962 --> 00:12:45.764
I've set up three infrared
dvr cameras.

248
00:12:45.766 --> 00:12:47.799
I have one camera set up
in the back bedroom

249
00:12:47.801 --> 00:12:49.534
Shooting towards that closet.

250
00:12:49.536 --> 00:12:51.936
This is the room where
the ghost loop originates.

251
00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:54.806
I have another camera shooting
right down the hallway,

252
00:12:54.808 --> 00:12:56.040
This is where
the spirit travels

253
00:12:56.042 --> 00:12:58.109
Along the ceiling
from the back bedroom.

254
00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:00.378
And then the last camera
is in the other bedroom,

255
00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.548
Which is where
the spirit travels to.

256
00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:04.616
Check, check, check.

257
00:13:10.791 --> 00:13:13.258
<i> Alright. I'm going</i>
<i> to try to trigger this thing.</i>

258
00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:18.363
<i> You know that I'm here.</i>

259
00:13:18.365 --> 00:13:22.233
I know you know who I am.

260
00:13:22.235 --> 00:13:23.968
What was that?

261
00:13:28.675 --> 00:13:31.643
I know you made that sound.

262
00:13:31.645 --> 00:13:33.144
That's why I'm here.

263
00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:37.515
<i> So we're going to hang out</i>
<i> for a few minutes.</i>

264
00:13:37.517 --> 00:13:39.050
<i> I want to know</i>
<i> why you're making</i>

265
00:13:39.052 --> 00:13:44.656
<i> Theresa feel the way</i>
<i> she's feeling.</i>

266
00:13:44.658 --> 00:13:46.191
Alright, matt.
Head to the hallway,

267
00:13:46.193 --> 00:13:48.059
Stand by the door, in case
we need you back there quickly.

268
00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:49.260
Okay,
you got the walkie?

269
00:13:49.262 --> 00:13:50.695
I got the walkie.

270
00:13:50.697 --> 00:13:52.897
<i> I'm getting really hot.</i>
<i> Am I getting really hot,</i>

271
00:13:52.899 --> 00:13:55.266
<i> Because you're trying</i>
<i> to enter my energy field?</i>

272
00:13:55.268 --> 00:13:58.269
<i> Are you making me</i>
<i> burn up right now?</i>

273
00:13:58.271 --> 00:13:59.871
Ride the corner,
make sure that if we need

274
00:13:59.873 --> 00:14:03.074
To move in quick, we can.

275
00:14:03.076 --> 00:14:06.110
<i> Tell us why you're here.</i>

276
00:14:13.486 --> 00:14:15.186
He's watching the closet.

277
00:14:18.425 --> 00:14:19.624
<i> You'll mess with theresa. Why?</i>

278
00:14:19.626 --> 00:14:21.893
<i> Because her energy</i>
<i> is vulnerable,</i>

279
00:14:21.895 --> 00:14:23.595
<i> Because you broke her down?</i>

280
00:14:23.597 --> 00:14:27.665
<i> She's lost friends,</i>
<i> it's ruined relationships.</i>

281
00:14:27.667 --> 00:14:30.702
<i> And that's what you wanted.</i>
<i> But why?</i>

282
00:14:30.704 --> 00:14:34.138
<i> Tell me why.</i>

283
00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.708
<i> I'm sensing a female energy.</i>

284
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:37.976
We're going to the closet now.

285
00:14:37.978 --> 00:14:39.777
We've got no eyes
on the closet whatsoever.

286
00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:46.918
<i> It really pisses me off, that</i>
<i> you could ruin someone's life.</i>

287
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.686
<i> I feel something behind me.</i>

288
00:14:50.924 --> 00:14:55.426
<i> Okay, you're here.</i>

289
00:14:55.428 --> 00:14:58.696
<i> Tell me why you're doing this.</i>

290
00:14:58.698 --> 00:14:59.998
- Something just happened to her.
- Yep.

291
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.299
<i> I can feel you.</i>

292
00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:07.338
<i> Guys, I'm getting a whiff</i>
<i> of that sulfur smell.</i>

293
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.941
Now that kris
has summoned the entity...

294
00:15:09.943 --> 00:15:11.409
Copy that.
...Califf and matt

295
00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:14.545
Bring in a spirit box
to communicate.

296
00:15:14.547 --> 00:15:19.884
So what's the obsession
with these two rooms?

297
00:15:25.525 --> 00:15:28.026
What are you afraid of?

298
00:15:28.028 --> 00:15:30.561
Are you afraid that we hold
the key to end this loop?

299
00:15:31.731 --> 00:15:34.399
Wow.
My god.
What was that?

300
00:15:43.677 --> 00:15:46.611
Theresa and her family
are being plagued

301
00:15:46.613 --> 00:15:49.147
By the ghost loop
of a female entity

302
00:15:49.149 --> 00:15:52.917
Crawling from one of theresa's
son's rooms to another.

303
00:15:52.919 --> 00:15:56.721
While sean and eric investigate
the stillborn burial ground,

304
00:15:56.723 --> 00:16:00.491
Kris, matt, and califf,
make contact with who they think

305
00:16:00.493 --> 00:16:03.094
Is the female energy
causing the loop.

306
00:16:06.666 --> 00:16:09.100
What's the obsession
with these two rooms?

307
00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:14.072
What are you afraid of?

308
00:16:14.074 --> 00:16:16.741
Are you afraid that we hold
the key to end this loop?

309
00:16:22.716 --> 00:16:25.149
My god.
What was that?

310
00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:26.317
Did we hit a nerve?

311
00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:28.252
I felt that.

312
00:16:28.254 --> 00:16:30.755
I don't mean to be scared,
but, like, holy ****.
My god.

313
00:16:30.757 --> 00:16:34.692
The spirit just jabbed me.
This thing has a lot of energy.

314
00:16:34.694 --> 00:16:37.362
It's scary,
but I won't let it bully me.

315
00:16:37.364 --> 00:16:39.731
Did you poke me in my side?

316
00:16:39.733 --> 00:16:42.734
Didn't hurt, so good try,
but it tickled.

317
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.503
Sounded like a kid.

318
00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:46.904
Sounded like
a **** kid.

319
00:16:49.976 --> 00:16:54.212
My god. Guys, maybe there's
a child trying to come through.

320
00:16:54.214 --> 00:16:56.247
Or it's the ghost loop,
pretending to be a child.

321
00:16:56.249 --> 00:16:59.684
While califf, matt, and kris
continue their investigation

322
00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:02.220
In the home,
a spirit has led

323
00:17:02.222 --> 00:17:07.025
Sean and eric back to
the stillborn burial grounds.

324
00:17:07.027 --> 00:17:09.994
They bring out the sls camera,

325
00:17:09.996 --> 00:17:12.630
Which shows the spirits
in the form of stick figures.

326
00:17:17.337 --> 00:17:22.206
I want you to show us where
the babies are buried.

327
00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:42.226
My god.

328
00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:44.062
It's right next
to you, bro.

329
00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:46.130
Are you serious?
It's over your left shoulder.

330
00:17:46.132 --> 00:17:48.966
Dude.

331
00:17:48.968 --> 00:17:50.601
Man.

332
00:17:50.603 --> 00:17:54.005
A spirit reached out to us
and said, "this is my son."

333
00:17:54.007 --> 00:17:55.840
I have to follow that lead.

334
00:17:55.842 --> 00:17:57.241
Where you're standing
to the left of me,

335
00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:58.776
Is that where
your son's buried?

336
00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:05.183
Can you point to where
the baby's buried?

337
00:18:05.185 --> 00:18:08.319
To the left?
Who's left? Sean's left?

338
00:18:08.321 --> 00:18:11.222
But it must be,
that's where it's standing.
Yes, there it is.

339
00:18:11.224 --> 00:18:13.658
So you're saying right
in this area here?

340
00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:19.964
If a spirit
stops communicating,

341
00:18:19.966 --> 00:18:22.934
Sometimes it's beneficial
to swap the questioner.

342
00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:25.470
Here, switch it up.
This change in
personal energy

343
00:18:25.472 --> 00:18:28.039
Can reopen the door
to the spirit world.

344
00:18:31.244 --> 00:18:34.512
Who's the entity that was just
standing in front of sean?

345
00:18:37.484 --> 00:18:40.518
Were you showing us where
the body's buried over there?

346
00:18:46.159 --> 00:18:47.358
To your left.

347
00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.726
It said to your left?
It said to your left.

348
00:18:48.728 --> 00:18:50.261
That's the second
it's said that.

349
00:18:50.263 --> 00:18:51.696
It's got to be right here.
That's two times.

350
00:18:51.698 --> 00:18:54.632
Is this where
the baby's buried?

351
00:18:59.806 --> 00:19:02.273
Di-- dude,
it said "dig it."

352
00:19:02.275 --> 00:19:05.042
Is that what you
want us to do, dig?

353
00:19:05.044 --> 00:19:06.110
Do it.
Do it.

354
00:19:09.282 --> 00:19:10.882
Dude, I'm in shock.
Me too.

355
00:19:10.884 --> 00:19:12.950
We got some
incredible evidence, sean.

356
00:19:12.952 --> 00:19:15.887
I began to form a theory
that the ghost keeps pushing us

357
00:19:15.889 --> 00:19:17.522
To the stillborn burial ground.

358
00:19:17.524 --> 00:19:19.924
Theresa told us
it was a female spirit,

359
00:19:19.926 --> 00:19:22.226
Could it have
buried a baby here?

360
00:19:22.228 --> 00:19:25.029
The preliminary investigation
of theresa's property

361
00:19:25.031 --> 00:19:27.532
Has yielded
some incredible results.

362
00:19:27.534 --> 00:19:30.801
Through the evidence, the team
has discovered a female entity

363
00:19:30.803 --> 00:19:33.504
Along with a childlike voice
in the house.

364
00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:35.840
While at the stillborn
burial grounds,

365
00:19:35.842 --> 00:19:38.075
A spirit appeared to eric
and sean,

366
00:19:38.077 --> 00:19:43.181
Said, "that was my son,"
and to, "dig a grave."

367
00:19:43.183 --> 00:19:46.317
But there's one more lead
the team needs to follow.

368
00:19:46.319 --> 00:19:48.419
Califf has uncovered evidence
of a bridge

369
00:19:48.421 --> 00:19:51.856
On theresa's property
that has a tragic past.

370
00:19:51.858 --> 00:19:53.791
Califf talks
to longtime resident

371
00:19:53.793 --> 00:19:55.927
And former law
enforcement officer, doug.

372
00:19:55.929 --> 00:19:58.763
How you doing today?
You know theresa
pretty well?

373
00:19:58.765 --> 00:20:00.932
How familiar are you
with the property,

374
00:20:00.934 --> 00:20:04.035
As far as old roads
and bridges?

375
00:20:04.037 --> 00:20:07.538
There's signs of an old bridge
down here on the creek

376
00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.808
And this road here
came all the way through

377
00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:13.811
And that's where it crossed
the bridge down there.

378
00:20:13.813 --> 00:20:16.714
The pylon is still there
from that bridge.-

379
00:20:16.716 --> 00:20:19.016
Looking at the history
of the county,

380
00:20:19.018 --> 00:20:23.487
There was an epidemic
as far as people being lynched

381
00:20:23.489 --> 00:20:25.690
In the county
and the surrounding areas.

382
00:20:25.692 --> 00:20:27.858
I had a picture of --
it's not very clear --

383
00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:32.129
That someone gave me one time,
of a hanging, there.

384
00:20:32.131 --> 00:20:34.665
And I was told it was the last
one that they did there.

385
00:20:34.667 --> 00:20:36.500
What year?
I don't know,

386
00:20:36.502 --> 00:20:39.170
I think it was
in the 1920s or something.

387
00:20:39.172 --> 00:20:42.306
In the 1920s, florida
was a frontier state

388
00:20:42.308 --> 00:20:44.875
With a history
of racial violence.

389
00:20:44.877 --> 00:20:48.279
However, the town of palatka
was a well-known safe haven

390
00:20:48.281 --> 00:20:51.916
Due to its tolerant but strict
sheriff, peter hagan.

391
00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:55.353
In 1924, that all changed
when a new sheriff,

392
00:20:55.355 --> 00:20:57.688
R.J. Hancock, was elected.

393
00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:59.890
A known klan sympathizer,

394
00:20:59.892 --> 00:21:02.493
Lynching and mob violence
became common.

395
00:21:02.495 --> 00:21:04.028
That was the kind of thing
that was going on

396
00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.731
Around the country,

397
00:21:06.733 --> 00:21:08.332
Especially in the south.

398
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:14.839
Califf, kris, and matt decide
to investigate the old bridge

399
00:21:14.841 --> 00:21:17.441
Where the lynchings
allegedly occurred,

400
00:21:17.443 --> 00:21:19.910
To see if there's
a connection to the ghost loop.

401
00:21:19.912 --> 00:21:22.480
It doesn't look like
many people come back here.

402
00:21:22.482 --> 00:21:24.815
Probably a lot
of snakes.
Okay.

403
00:21:24.817 --> 00:21:29.086
So if I scream, it's more
than likely a snake.

404
00:21:34.694 --> 00:21:37.695
Matt, are you rolling?
Yeah.

405
00:21:37.697 --> 00:21:40.731
I'm really feeling
this over here, guys.

406
00:21:47.674 --> 00:21:49.273
Be careful through here,
it's all slick, man.

407
00:21:49.275 --> 00:21:51.309
Got it.

408
00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:53.878
I'm feeling that spot
right there by that tree.

409
00:21:56.849 --> 00:21:58.749
Unless I missed my guess,

410
00:21:58.751 --> 00:22:00.217
That's the foundation
of the old bridge.

411
00:22:00.219 --> 00:22:02.386
Holy crap.
I got goose bumps.

412
00:22:11.931 --> 00:22:14.231
It's really heavy.

413
00:22:14.233 --> 00:22:16.267
People died here.
Yeah.

414
00:22:16.269 --> 00:22:19.837
There's a lot of devastation and
unjust things that happened.

415
00:22:19.839 --> 00:22:23.741
You guys want to get
the spirit box out?

416
00:22:23.743 --> 00:22:26.677
Okay, so you know
why we're here,

417
00:22:26.679 --> 00:22:31.582
We're here to investigate
this bridge.

418
00:22:31.584 --> 00:22:33.117
Can you come through for us?

419
00:22:38.624 --> 00:22:40.524
How do you feel
right now?

420
00:22:40.526 --> 00:22:43.260
Really heavy pressure kind of
in the back of my head.

421
00:22:43.262 --> 00:22:44.662
Right here in the back
of my neck.
Really?

422
00:22:44.664 --> 00:22:46.163
Yes.
Yeah, it's still scary.

423
00:22:46.165 --> 00:22:48.833
Just because it's during the day
does not mean we're comfortable.

424
00:22:48.835 --> 00:22:51.135
It's still
a really weird vibe.

425
00:22:57.176 --> 00:22:59.810
Were there
lynchings here?

426
00:22:59.812 --> 00:23:01.746
What the hell was that?

427
00:23:03.449 --> 00:23:07.785
Okay. Put the spirit box
on the foundation.

428
00:23:07.787 --> 00:23:12.923
Does anybody need help?
Are you trapped by this bridge?

429
00:23:12.925 --> 00:23:13.858
It said "yes."

430
00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.127
My god.
Holy ****.

431
00:23:25.438 --> 00:23:27.371
Although the team
has found evidence

432
00:23:27.373 --> 00:23:30.141
Of a female spirit
in the house...

433
00:23:30.143 --> 00:23:33.043
<i> I'm sensing</i>
<i> a female energy.</i>

434
00:23:33.045 --> 00:23:35.513
...And in the stillborn
burial grounds...

435
00:23:35.515 --> 00:23:38.182
Did you lose a son?

436
00:23:38.184 --> 00:23:40.785
"I did,"
in a female voice.

437
00:23:40.787 --> 00:23:44.755
...That could be causing the
ghost loop in theresa's home,

438
00:23:44.757 --> 00:23:48.559
Califf is following another
lead of a high activity area

439
00:23:48.561 --> 00:23:52.062
That was allegedly once used
for lynchings in the 1920s.

440
00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.134
Put the spirit box
on the foundation.

441
00:23:57.136 --> 00:24:02.206
Does anybody need help?
Are you trapped by this bridge?

442
00:24:02.208 --> 00:24:03.207
It said yes.

443
00:24:03.209 --> 00:24:05.009
My god.

444
00:24:05.011 --> 00:24:06.677
This property is just bad.

445
00:24:09.449 --> 00:24:14.552
Do you have anything
to do with the home?

446
00:24:14.554 --> 00:24:16.120
Anything to do with that at all?

447
00:24:19.358 --> 00:24:22.159
Are you a spirit from the house?

448
00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:34.638
Although this residual energy
is an echo of a tragic past,

449
00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.340
It's not connected
to the ghost loop,

450
00:24:36.342 --> 00:24:38.976
And in no way is that going to
help us solve this mystery.

451
00:24:38.978 --> 00:24:42.179
Alright, let's
wrap it up. Get back.

452
00:24:42.181 --> 00:24:44.548
Now that the
investigation has concluded,

453
00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:48.152
The team reconvenes
to go over the evidence.

454
00:24:48.154 --> 00:24:49.820
It's been a crazy, crazy
couple of days, man.

455
00:24:49.822 --> 00:24:53.657
I mean, we started off
in the house.

456
00:24:53.659 --> 00:24:55.860
When I was in there
doing a spirit session,

457
00:24:55.862 --> 00:24:58.028
I was poked right on my side.

458
00:25:00.099 --> 00:25:02.233
My god.
What was that?

459
00:25:02.235 --> 00:25:05.369
A child came through,
as well as a lady.

460
00:25:05.371 --> 00:25:07.805
<i> I feel something behind me.</i>

461
00:25:07.807 --> 00:25:12.510
<i> Okay.</i>
<i> I'm sensing a female energy.</i>

462
00:25:12.512 --> 00:25:16.313
So sean and I went down
to the stillborn baby cemetery.

463
00:25:18.417 --> 00:25:20.017
We were using the sls.

464
00:25:20.019 --> 00:25:24.188
I actually saw an entity
appear next to sean.

465
00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:26.557
My god, it's right
next to you, bro.

466
00:25:26.559 --> 00:25:28.626
Are you serious?
It's over your
left shoulder.

467
00:25:28.628 --> 00:25:30.794
Dude.

468
00:25:30.796 --> 00:25:33.397
And we got a voice
out of the spirit box

469
00:25:33.399 --> 00:25:34.932
That actually told us to dig.

470
00:25:34.934 --> 00:25:36.867
- Are you, like --
- to the left.

471
00:25:36.869 --> 00:25:38.669
Yeah, I'm getting goose bumps
talking about it.
Goose bumps, yeah,
right now.

472
00:25:38.671 --> 00:25:39.904
And you know what's
most important,

473
00:25:39.906 --> 00:25:41.238
Is that all these little pieces
of the puzzle

474
00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.140
We're all pulling together here,
they're all correlating

475
00:25:43.142 --> 00:25:45.342
With what theresa has told us
during our interview with her.

476
00:25:45.344 --> 00:25:48.913
She'll come out
from my boy's bedroom,

477
00:25:48.915 --> 00:25:55.052
Crawling on the ceiling.
It's just so frightening.

478
00:25:55.054 --> 00:25:57.254
The repetitive haunting
of this thing,

479
00:25:57.256 --> 00:25:59.557
Crawling around the ceiling
and going back and forth

480
00:25:59.559 --> 00:26:02.660
To those two bedrooms
where her sons slept,

481
00:26:02.662 --> 00:26:03.994
There's some sort of connection
of why

482
00:26:03.996 --> 00:26:05.829
This thing is attracted
to the boy energy,

483
00:26:05.831 --> 00:26:08.365
Because of this potential child
that was lost.

484
00:26:08.367 --> 00:26:10.668
It's very possible
for this entity, this woman,

485
00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:12.002
To be looking
for her child.
Yes.

486
00:26:12.004 --> 00:26:14.071
Causing all this havoc
and wreaking all of this stuff

487
00:26:14.073 --> 00:26:16.574
Because she can't
find her child.

488
00:26:16.576 --> 00:26:18.108
I'm convinced this one entity

489
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:20.578
Trying to communicate
in different voices

490
00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:22.880
Is a mother searching
for her child.

491
00:26:22.882 --> 00:26:25.616
And I think that leads us
to our trigger environment.

492
00:26:25.618 --> 00:26:27.151
Basically,
a trigger environment

493
00:26:27.153 --> 00:26:28.953
Is a place
within a haunted location.

494
00:26:28.955 --> 00:26:32.256
It's made in order
to provoke this spirit

495
00:26:32.258 --> 00:26:33.324
And it's going to
come towards us

496
00:26:33.326 --> 00:26:34.792
And we're going to get it out.

497
00:26:34.794 --> 00:26:37.194
Considering what we experienced
over there in the grave site

498
00:26:37.196 --> 00:26:38.596
And what we've experienced
in the house,

499
00:26:38.598 --> 00:26:41.265
We should create
some sort of nursery.

500
00:26:41.267 --> 00:26:43.400
A nursery will trigger
what the female spirit

501
00:26:43.402 --> 00:26:47.938
May have hoped for in life --
bringing up a healthy baby boy.

502
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.540
And create some sort
of environment

503
00:26:49.542 --> 00:26:51.208
As a proper burial
to the mother

504
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.010
And the child
near the grave site.

505
00:26:53.012 --> 00:26:55.346
This trigger
environment will help the spirit

506
00:26:55.348 --> 00:26:59.049
Cross over, where she will find
rest with her lost son.

507
00:26:59.051 --> 00:27:00.484
We know the stillborns
were buried

508
00:27:00.486 --> 00:27:01.719
At the turn of
the century.

509
00:27:01.721 --> 00:27:04.188
The stillborn graveyard
stopped in the '20s,

510
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:05.589
So I think that
kind of gives us an idea

511
00:27:05.591 --> 00:27:08.993
Of what time frame to make
this trigger environment.

512
00:27:08.995 --> 00:27:10.894
A nursery and a grave site.

513
00:27:10.896 --> 00:27:14.565
Lure the spirit out,
break this ghost loop.

514
00:27:14.567 --> 00:27:17.735
A lot of these families are,
I mean, they're living in fear.

515
00:27:17.737 --> 00:27:21.071
We're not here to just
capture activity and bail.

516
00:27:21.073 --> 00:27:24.942
If we don't help these families,
our work is not done.

517
00:27:29.915 --> 00:27:34.318
The spirit hunters
create two trigger environments.

518
00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.721
The first, a turn-of-the-century
nursery in the room

519
00:27:37.723 --> 00:27:39.890
Where the ghost loop
keeps returning.

520
00:27:43.663 --> 00:27:46.997
The second, a ritual burial

521
00:27:46.999 --> 00:27:50.000
That will unite the female
entity with her lost son.

522
00:27:52.138 --> 00:27:53.604
The idea of
the trigger environment

523
00:27:53.606 --> 00:27:55.439
Personalizes it
for that spirit.

524
00:27:55.441 --> 00:28:00.511
So if that spirit's lost,
or scared, or angry,

525
00:28:00.513 --> 00:28:03.480
We're essentially building a
superconductor for these things.

526
00:28:03.482 --> 00:28:06.583
What the ****?
Who's that?

527
00:28:06.585 --> 00:28:09.086
**** that.
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

528
00:28:23.302 --> 00:28:25.869
The spirit hunters
have identified the ghost loop

529
00:28:25.871 --> 00:28:27.838
That is terrifying theresa,

530
00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:31.675
As a mother searching
for her lost child.

531
00:28:31.677 --> 00:28:35.546
Although theresa's family owned
this property for generations,

532
00:28:35.548 --> 00:28:38.649
Theresa's grandmother witnessed
poor women of the area

533
00:28:38.651 --> 00:28:41.285
Burying their stillborns
on the property.

534
00:28:41.287 --> 00:28:43.153
At the turn of the 20th century,

535
00:28:43.155 --> 00:28:46.857
56% of americans
lived below the poverty line

536
00:28:46.859 --> 00:28:49.226
And the rate of stillborn births
was high.

537
00:28:49.228 --> 00:28:51.128
Most of these women
had no recourse

538
00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:54.031
But to bury these
lost souls in secret.

539
00:28:54.033 --> 00:28:57.067
The spirit causing the ghost
loop is one of these women,

540
00:28:57.069 --> 00:28:59.402
Desperately searching
for her lost child.

541
00:29:02.908 --> 00:29:04.675
So the spirit hunters
have created

542
00:29:04.677 --> 00:29:06.510
Two trigger environments.

543
00:29:08.514 --> 00:29:12.082
A turn-of-the-century nursery
to lure the female entity.

544
00:29:21.894 --> 00:29:24.795
Where the entity will be
reunited with her lost child

545
00:29:24.797 --> 00:29:26.630
In their final resting place.

546
00:29:32.905 --> 00:29:36.440
For this triggering,
the team has split into two.

547
00:29:36.442 --> 00:29:38.108
Matt, kris, and califf

548
00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:41.879
Will await the entity's arrival
at the grave site.

549
00:29:41.881 --> 00:29:46.216
While eric and sean draw
the entity out to the nursery.

550
00:29:46.218 --> 00:29:49.319
Alright, eric.
We have the back bedroom,

551
00:29:49.321 --> 00:29:50.721
Which is on the top left.

552
00:29:50.723 --> 00:29:54.057
We got the trigger environment
here on the top right

553
00:29:54.059 --> 00:29:56.527
And then we have the hallway,
just in case the entity

554
00:29:56.529 --> 00:29:58.729
Peeks its head out.

555
00:29:58.731 --> 00:30:00.464
What I think we should do
is just start out

556
00:30:00.466 --> 00:30:03.433
In the main trigger
environment.
Nursery.

557
00:30:03.435 --> 00:30:06.904
Let's get
the gateway setup.
Yeah.

558
00:30:06.906 --> 00:30:09.239
The gateway is actually
a glorified spirit box.

559
00:30:09.241 --> 00:30:11.809
It actually sifts through
frequencies of a radio,

560
00:30:11.811 --> 00:30:13.443
But on top of that
it has a gating noise

561
00:30:13.445 --> 00:30:16.180
That actually eliminates
a lot of the white noise.

562
00:30:16.182 --> 00:30:20.517
You can hear the spirits
talk clearer

563
00:30:20.519 --> 00:30:22.386
And see what kind of
communication we can get

564
00:30:22.388 --> 00:30:24.154
With this environment
we've creative.

565
00:30:30.329 --> 00:30:33.730
Ready to get to
this graveyard.
Let's go.

566
00:30:33.732 --> 00:30:36.099
My.

567
00:30:36.101 --> 00:30:38.435
This is so much creepier
at night.
Yeah.

568
00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:46.877
The stillborns being buried here

569
00:30:46.879 --> 00:30:50.747
And just being left
to be forgotten about.

570
00:30:50.749 --> 00:30:52.983
Just...

571
00:30:52.985 --> 00:30:56.153
I mean, I don't even know what
I feel right now...

572
00:30:57.756 --> 00:31:00.023
...As a dad.

573
00:31:00.025 --> 00:31:01.792
I feel like I'm going
to throw up.

574
00:31:01.794 --> 00:31:03.393
Are you serious?
Yeah.

575
00:31:05.698 --> 00:31:07.264
What the hell was that?

576
00:31:10.569 --> 00:31:12.236
I saw a light right here.

577
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:20.944
What do you feel, califf?

578
00:31:20.946 --> 00:31:23.113
It's that constant feeling
of being watched.

579
00:31:26.485 --> 00:31:28.252
God, it feels gross out here.

580
00:31:35.861 --> 00:31:37.461
We placed the gateway
in the crib,

581
00:31:37.463 --> 00:31:40.197
Because this is the most
emotionally charged area

582
00:31:40.199 --> 00:31:42.065
Of the trigger environment.

583
00:31:45.838 --> 00:31:47.804
The woman who
lost a child,

584
00:31:47.806 --> 00:31:50.007
Can you come forward
and say something?

585
00:31:54.446 --> 00:31:57.080
Use this device,
project your energy through it.

586
00:32:00.786 --> 00:32:03.186
What the hell was that?
What was that?

587
00:32:03.188 --> 00:32:04.688
My god.
It's smoking.

588
00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:08.225
The gateway is smoking, sean.
Smoke coming out of it.

589
00:32:08.227 --> 00:32:09.626
Are you kidding me?

590
00:32:13.465 --> 00:32:15.866
Eric to matt.

591
00:32:15.868 --> 00:32:17.668
<i> Go for matt.</i>

592
00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:20.337
When you used the gateway
last night,

593
00:32:20.339 --> 00:32:22.639
Did you fiddle with
any of the wires at all?

594
00:32:22.641 --> 00:32:26.410
It's smoking. We heard a loud
popping noise and it's smoking.

595
00:32:26.412 --> 00:32:28.612
I didn't do anything.
I didn't unplug anything.

596
00:32:28.614 --> 00:32:30.013
I didn't plug anything in.

597
00:32:30.015 --> 00:32:32.749
<i> I didn't do anything</i>
<i> to that thing.</i>

598
00:32:32.751 --> 00:32:34.851
Copy that.

599
00:32:34.853 --> 00:32:37.921
As soon as we put it into
the trigger environment, boom.

600
00:32:37.923 --> 00:32:40.290
We've been using this for over
a year, this has never happened.

601
00:32:40.292 --> 00:32:42.592
This thing
is definitely pissed.

602
00:32:42.594 --> 00:32:46.830
Spirits can sabotage equipment
by creating power surges.

603
00:32:46.832 --> 00:32:49.766
Sean replaces the gateway
with a tablet spirit box

604
00:32:49.768 --> 00:32:53.236
To communicate with the entity.

605
00:32:54.907 --> 00:32:57.774
You were seen crawling along
the hallway up on the ceiling.

606
00:32:57.776 --> 00:33:00.610
We want to see you.

607
00:33:00.612 --> 00:33:02.279
You can pop all of our equipment
all you want,

608
00:33:02.281 --> 00:33:06.616
But in the end,
our faith protects us

609
00:33:06.618 --> 00:33:08.285
And you're going to leave
theresa alone.

610
00:33:10.556 --> 00:33:13.724
Free me. I think it just said,
"free me."

611
00:33:13.726 --> 00:33:15.592
I'm going to
free you, ma'am.

612
00:33:15.594 --> 00:33:17.995
We are going to do everything
we can to help you.

613
00:33:19.164 --> 00:33:20.330
Please.

614
00:33:20.332 --> 00:33:22.866
She just screamed, "please."

615
00:33:22.868 --> 00:33:24.768
What just happened?
Are you kidding me?

616
00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:26.470
No way. Dude.

617
00:33:26.472 --> 00:33:27.838
You're kidding me.

618
00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.774
I'm feeling really weird
in here right now, bro.

619
00:33:30.776 --> 00:33:32.142
My tablet just popped.

620
00:33:32.144 --> 00:33:35.479
It made a pop noise
and it's completely dead.

621
00:33:35.481 --> 00:33:37.581
This -- that -- now that --
now that turns --

622
00:33:37.583 --> 00:33:39.282
Makes it really weird, man.

623
00:33:41.387 --> 00:33:43.220
Eric to matt.

624
00:33:48.994 --> 00:33:50.761
I hope they're
alright right out there.

625
00:33:52.598 --> 00:33:55.465
It seems like califf
is feeling something.
Yeah.

626
00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:00.170
What the ****
was that?

627
00:34:00.172 --> 00:34:03.106
You alright?
What happened?

628
00:34:05.477 --> 00:34:08.111
**** that.
Nope, nope, nope, nope.
What? What?

629
00:34:08.113 --> 00:34:09.413
**** that.
What?
What is it?

630
00:34:17.923 --> 00:34:20.457
After building a
nursery trigger environment

631
00:34:20.459 --> 00:34:23.960
To lure the female entity
looking for her son,

632
00:34:23.962 --> 00:34:25.962
Eric and sean were
able to engage

633
00:34:25.964 --> 00:34:28.732
The spirit in the nursery.

634
00:34:28.734 --> 00:34:31.802
Free me. I think it just said,
"free me."

635
00:34:31.804 --> 00:34:33.236
But after a power surge

636
00:34:33.238 --> 00:34:35.572
From the entity
blows up their equipment...

637
00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:40.410
Eric to matt.

638
00:34:40.412 --> 00:34:43.780
...The spirit disappears.

639
00:34:43.782 --> 00:34:45.515
Eric and I brought
the spirit to the nursery

640
00:34:45.517 --> 00:34:47.250
To tell it we'll cross it over.

641
00:34:47.252 --> 00:34:49.986
Our hope is that it's gone to
the second trigger environment,

642
00:34:49.988 --> 00:34:53.256
So we can reunite her
with her son.

643
00:34:53.258 --> 00:34:55.258
I just hope the rest
of the team are ready.

644
00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:01.098
What the ****
was that?

645
00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:02.866
You alright?

646
00:35:02.868 --> 00:35:04.000
What happened?

647
00:35:06.805 --> 00:35:08.905
**** that.
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

648
00:35:08.907 --> 00:35:10.874
What?
What is it?

649
00:35:10.876 --> 00:35:14.044
Holy ****.

650
00:35:14.046 --> 00:35:16.279
Holy ****!

651
00:35:16.281 --> 00:35:18.748
Dude, I've never seen him
like that.

652
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:20.717
Holy **** dude, no.

653
00:35:23.388 --> 00:35:26.890
No.
Dude, this thing
is going off.

654
00:35:26.892 --> 00:35:29.726
Look at this.
Are you good?

655
00:35:29.728 --> 00:35:34.431
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.
What happened?

656
00:35:34.433 --> 00:35:35.866
Do you copy, eric?

657
00:35:35.868 --> 00:35:37.467
Are you guys alright
out there?

658
00:35:37.469 --> 00:35:39.402
<i> Yeah, you guys need</i>
<i> to come down here.</i>

659
00:35:39.404 --> 00:35:41.638
<i> Things are getting weird.</i>

660
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.406
We're coming right now.

661
00:35:43.408 --> 00:35:45.742
<i> We're walking out</i>
<i> of the house right now.</i>

662
00:35:51.116 --> 00:35:54.117
anyway, I've
been doing this for a long time.

663
00:35:54.119 --> 00:35:57.621
I was looking on the tree line
I saw a red flash of light,

664
00:35:57.623 --> 00:35:59.156
So I figured might as well
get over there quick

665
00:35:59.158 --> 00:36:00.524
And see what that was.

666
00:36:03.195 --> 00:36:05.595
And as soon as I go over there,
I came up the hill,

667
00:36:05.597 --> 00:36:09.232
I looked down and it was like
the nastiest face

668
00:36:09.234 --> 00:36:12.802
You could possibly imagine was
like right there just looking.

669
00:36:12.804 --> 00:36:14.971
But I've never seen
anything that was like,

670
00:36:14.973 --> 00:36:17.040
You're coming to hell, like,
you're coming with me.

671
00:36:17.042 --> 00:36:19.910
Ever in my life.
And it just...

672
00:36:21.513 --> 00:36:24.514
Was it a lady?
Yeah.

673
00:36:24.516 --> 00:36:26.650
If you can imagine
a woman's face

674
00:36:26.652 --> 00:36:30.220
And all the life
being sucked out of it,

675
00:36:30.222 --> 00:36:32.122
That's pretty much
what you would see.

676
00:36:40.699 --> 00:36:42.432
<i> What's going on</i>
<i> down there, man?</i>

677
00:36:42.434 --> 00:36:44.534
Califf went off by himself

678
00:36:44.536 --> 00:36:46.603
Down in the little graveyard,

679
00:36:46.605 --> 00:36:48.939
Looks down
and sees a face of a woman.

680
00:36:51.443 --> 00:36:54.978
We're getting really,
really close to the exact answer

681
00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:57.013
We need to close
this ghost loop.

682
00:36:57.015 --> 00:36:59.349
Copy that.
<i> Over and out.</i>

683
00:37:02.254 --> 00:37:06.389
I've never seen him act
like that.

684
00:37:06.391 --> 00:37:08.725
Here come
the guys now.

685
00:37:08.727 --> 00:37:10.360
You guys alright?

686
00:37:10.362 --> 00:37:14.064
Not even close.
Not even close.

687
00:37:14.066 --> 00:37:15.432
It was crazy in there.

688
00:37:15.434 --> 00:37:17.934
I've never been happier
to see you guys in my life.

689
00:37:17.936 --> 00:37:20.170
It's been an incredible,
one hell of a night.

690
00:37:20.172 --> 00:37:21.204
But how do we end this?

691
00:37:21.206 --> 00:37:22.772
Alright guys, by creating

692
00:37:22.774 --> 00:37:24.774
The first trigger
environment in the home,

693
00:37:24.776 --> 00:37:26.276
We definitely lured
this spirit out

694
00:37:26.278 --> 00:37:27.911
And it messed with
all of our equipment.

695
00:37:27.913 --> 00:37:29.679
You guys were out here
and created

696
00:37:29.681 --> 00:37:32.382
This trigger environment.
It was lured out here.

697
00:37:32.384 --> 00:37:34.751
The team regroups
to speak to the entity

698
00:37:34.753 --> 00:37:36.720
That has revealed
itself to califf.

699
00:37:36.722 --> 00:37:39.389
Whoever suffered here
and led to a tragic death,

700
00:37:39.391 --> 00:37:41.625
You deserve to find peace.

701
00:37:41.627 --> 00:37:43.827
I am sick and tired
of watching my back.

702
00:37:46.732 --> 00:37:49.599
It is on you, dude.

703
00:37:49.601 --> 00:37:51.501
Are you saying
something's attached to him?

704
00:37:54.139 --> 00:37:55.639
What is attached to me?

705
00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:01.344
Grave.
It just said grave.

706
00:38:01.346 --> 00:38:04.247
I heard that.

707
00:38:04.249 --> 00:38:05.882
So if the grave is attached
to me,

708
00:38:05.884 --> 00:38:09.619
What would happen if I brought
the grave to the graveyard?

709
00:38:09.621 --> 00:38:11.621
So this thing's attached
to me

710
00:38:11.623 --> 00:38:13.590
And it's attached to me
because I'm a dad.

711
00:38:13.592 --> 00:38:15.091
I'm going to walk
to the cemetery.

712
00:38:15.093 --> 00:38:16.593
I'm going to lay
in that coffin.

713
00:38:16.595 --> 00:38:17.961
Why don't you come join me?

714
00:38:17.963 --> 00:38:19.162
You got holy water on you?

715
00:38:19.164 --> 00:38:21.731
Of course I do.
Okay.

716
00:38:21.733 --> 00:38:23.266
By putting myself down there,

717
00:38:23.268 --> 00:38:25.769
I was essentially bringing
her down there with me.

718
00:38:28.206 --> 00:38:32.442
You know, this is not part
of what I bargained for.

719
00:38:32.444 --> 00:38:34.277
Alright.
What do you want from me?

720
00:38:37.182 --> 00:38:39.249
Weird thing --
definitely colder.

721
00:38:46.058 --> 00:38:49.859
It just said kindred spirits.

722
00:38:49.861 --> 00:38:52.729
Kindred spirits could
mean the female entity

723
00:38:52.731 --> 00:38:55.298
Has chosen califf to bring
her to the grave

724
00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.967
Because he is a parent.

725
00:38:57.969 --> 00:39:01.004
What we're missing here
is the little child here.

726
00:39:01.006 --> 00:39:05.875
He knows best what
kind of pain she went through.

727
00:39:05.877 --> 00:39:08.545
With califf placing the doll
in the casket,

728
00:39:08.547 --> 00:39:10.580
The team unites
this female entity

729
00:39:10.582 --> 00:39:13.450
With her long-lost child...

730
00:39:14.853 --> 00:39:17.354
...And they will find peace.

731
00:39:17.356 --> 00:39:18.688
Goodnight, little one.

732
00:39:21.927 --> 00:39:23.660
This right here,

733
00:39:23.662 --> 00:39:25.128
This is us taking it
to the next level

734
00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:28.832
And showing the respect
and a true memorial

735
00:39:28.834 --> 00:39:32.869
To what this poor woman
went through, losing her child.

736
00:39:32.871 --> 00:39:35.872
Please lord, bring forth the
white light of the holy ghost

737
00:39:35.874 --> 00:39:37.874
And let this woman
and this child

738
00:39:37.876 --> 00:39:41.211
Who have suffered
truly tragic deaths, find peace

739
00:39:41.213 --> 00:39:43.546
And go towards the light
to be with their loved ones

740
00:39:43.548 --> 00:39:45.315
Where they truly deserve to be.

741
00:39:45.317 --> 00:39:47.150
We ask you this through christ,
our lord.

742
00:39:47.152 --> 00:39:49.552
Amen.

743
00:39:49.554 --> 00:39:53.490
Performing the ritual burial,
we are breaking the loop.

744
00:40:04.636 --> 00:40:07.804
I actually got
a flash of a white dove.

745
00:40:10.409 --> 00:40:12.709
I truly believe that we sent her
in the light tonight.

746
00:40:22.421 --> 00:40:26.556
Theresa, we came in and we
figured out who this entity was,

747
00:40:26.558 --> 00:40:29.392
And it was a mother
looking for her child.

748
00:40:29.394 --> 00:40:32.228
We believe that her entity
is attracted to you

749
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:33.496
Because you're a mother.

750
00:40:33.498 --> 00:40:36.666
She wants what you have
and she's envious

751
00:40:36.668 --> 00:40:39.102
And if you think about it,
she was going back and forth

752
00:40:39.104 --> 00:40:40.870
Between both
of your sons' rooms.

753
00:40:40.872 --> 00:40:44.374
That constant loop of energy.
She's looking for something.

754
00:40:44.376 --> 00:40:46.943
And losing a child
is terrible.

755
00:40:46.945 --> 00:40:49.179
No one needs to go through that.
No one should.

756
00:40:49.181 --> 00:40:50.480
Yeah, I can't imagine.

757
00:40:50.482 --> 00:40:53.883
I mean, as a mother, I just,
I can't even think of it.

758
00:40:53.885 --> 00:40:56.853
And by acknowledging that
and showing her a proper burial,

759
00:40:56.855 --> 00:40:58.254
Especially for her child,

760
00:40:58.256 --> 00:41:00.990
We helped her
to find peace and rest.

761
00:41:00.992 --> 00:41:03.359
God, what a tragic thing.

762
00:41:03.361 --> 00:41:08.331
I feel like the energy has
changed a lot in the house.

763
00:41:08.333 --> 00:41:11.568
I do, too. I feel like
you're more relaxed.

764
00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:13.636
You know, we blessed
the property.

765
00:41:13.638 --> 00:41:15.171
We put holy water
and blessed salt

766
00:41:15.173 --> 00:41:16.906
In every corner
of every room of this house.

767
00:41:16.908 --> 00:41:19.075
We said prayers
and put blessed medals

768
00:41:19.077 --> 00:41:20.109
In the four corners
of the property

769
00:41:20.111 --> 00:41:21.578
To keep
the negative energy out.

770
00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.213
Thank you.

771
00:41:23.215 --> 00:41:24.514
It's going to
take me a little while

772
00:41:24.516 --> 00:41:25.982
To wrap my head
around all of it

773
00:41:25.984 --> 00:41:30.286
Because I've been, in my mind
thinking it was evil,

774
00:41:30.288 --> 00:41:33.590
When in fact it was just
something crying for help.

775
00:41:33.592 --> 00:41:36.125
So now that she's found what
she's been looking for,

776
00:41:36.127 --> 00:41:38.661
It's over.

777
00:41:38.663 --> 00:41:42.799
Thank you guys so much.
I can't even begin to...

778
00:41:42.801 --> 00:41:45.468
Alright, so you always
have our support theresa.

779
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:49.105
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you, theresa.
God bless.

780
00:41:49.107 --> 00:41:51.074
You have no idea how much
this means to me. Thank you.

781
00:41:51.076 --> 00:41:52.408
Absolutely.
Yeah, it goes
beyond this.

782
00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:54.177
Bye pookey.
We're always here.

783
00:41:54.179 --> 00:41:56.679
I know you are.
Thank you.
Thank you.
