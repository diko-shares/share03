00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,120
<i>Hey</i>

2
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,600
<i>Hey</i>

3
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,360
<i>Get on the floor, straight feel the funk</i>

4
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,040
<i>It's real enough to make its rhythm pump</i>

5
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,760
<i>It's living this up
to do whatever you want</i>

6
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,520
<i>Dance around, don't
matter if the rhythm is off</i>

7
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,480
<i>Girl, show your body to
the fella that's watching</i>

8
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,200
<i>Too much romance and
pretend to be stopping</i>

9
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,800
<i>Another shot of booze,
I'm gonna be nauseous</i>

10
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,880
<i>You better be cautious</i>

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,120
<i>It's so much fun</i>

12
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,520
<i>to dance and let loose, don't think</i>

13
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,200
<i>The actions are based on animal instinct</i>

14
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,200
<i>The left step, right
step, front step, back step</i>

15
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,440
<i>Right on point and I
never even practiced</i>

16
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,040
<i>Come on, lady, please</i>

17
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,920
<i>do some crazy things</i>

18
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,560
<i>I need you to get with me</i>

19
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,320
<i>so we can freak this beat</i>

20
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,800
<i>Do what you want to do</i>

21
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,480
<i>Don't be afraid</i>

22
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,440
<i>if you want to move</i>

23
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,200
<i>Do what you want to do</i>

24
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,080
<i>Don't be afraid</i>

25
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,200
<i>if you want to move</i>

26
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,920
Corinne. You just made it.

27
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,160
Is everything okay?

28
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,360
<i>'Cause that will seem
like a starter step</i>

29
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,160
<i>Made moves all others would not forget</i>

30
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,000
<i>So as not to slip,
I'm gonna tug my pants</i>

31
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,920
<i>adjust my stance, sugar
push, clutch your hands</i>

32
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,600
<i>as we whip back and
forth like rubber bands</i>

33
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,760
<i>I huff and pant in a trance
'cause I love to dance</i>

34
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,400
<i>Do what you want to do</i>

35
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,680
<i>That's right, that's right</i>

36
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,160
<i>Don't be afraid</i>

37
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,720
<i>'Cause I'm gonna move</i>

38
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,800
<i>All right, and I'm dancing</i>

39
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,800
Jake?

40
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,760
Hey, Jake... my bad.

41
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,480
Wasn't she gonna meet you?

42
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,720
She was.

43
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,360
Well, she's not here,
and you're up next.

44
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,880
I know.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,960
All right.

46
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,600
Here we go with our next couple

47
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,520
in the showcase swing division,

48
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,920
David Olson and Lindsay Demetri.

49
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,080
<i>Driving my car, riding down the road</i>

50
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,040
<i>I got the stereo on</i>

51
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,440
<i>I'm about to explode</i>

52
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,680
<i>Blue sky shining and the sun burning hot</i>

53
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,440
<i>I keep expecting a call</i>

54
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,080
<i>I guess she must have forgot</i>

55
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,200
<i>Get to her house</i>

56
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,280
<i>Put my dancing shoes on</i>

57
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,800
<i>But when I knocked on the
door she was already gone</i>

58
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,920
Where were you?

59
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,320
Sorry.

60
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,760
Hell, if we hadn't got picked
to dance last this year...

61
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,760
Your ring.

62
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,320
Jake, appearances only.

63
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,320
You'll get it back after we dance.

64
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,440
So I guess it's really over, huh?

65
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,680
Oh, come on. Let's not do this.

66
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,960
You're the one that ended it.

67
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,800
You don't want to compete
anymore, and, well, I...

68
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,960
Well, you don't want to marry
someone with my condition.

69
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,320
That's not true, and you know it.

70
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,880
Shh!

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,640
<i>Just sitting around, baby,
waiting for the phone to ring</i>

72
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,240
<i>Laying around with my dancing shoes on</i>

73
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,040
<i>By the time I got there
she was already gone</i>

74
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,320
Look, are you gonna be there for me?

75
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,960
Oh, you think I would bail on you?

76
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,000
Focus. Okay, Jake?

77
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,040
I'll try.

78
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,080
Give it up for David and Lindsay.

79
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,840
Yeah.

80
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,600
Let's hear it for David and Lindsay.

81
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,480
What a great night here
at the 2002 U.S. Open.

82
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,960
Well, here we go with our final couple,

83
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,040
the defending U.S. Open
swing dance champions,

84
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,400
Jake Mitchell and Corinne Kennedy.

85
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,600
- That's the guy.
- What do you mean?

86
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,040
It's the guy with the...

87
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,440
Oh, you can hardly tell.

88
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,360
I'll be off to the side.

89
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,120
When you're ready, just flag me on.

90
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,920
But other than that, I'm all set to go.

91
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,360
You got it.

92
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,800
Hi.

93
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,800
Excuse me.

94
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,480
I'm just wondering what your
presentation is on today.

95
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,040
Whatever.

96
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,480
Did you just see that?

97
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,080
Yes, I did.

98
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,560
What's so funny?

99
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,520
Nothing.

100
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,960
Okay, folks.

101
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,080
Let's have all cell
phones off or on vibrate.

102
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,240
I can wait all day.

103
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,800
Today as part of our Red Ribbon Week,

104
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,640
we have a special guest.

105
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,160
Let's treat him with that
Millburn Middle School respect.

106
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,040
Please welcome Mr. Jake Mitchell.

107
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,960
Thank you.

108
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,520
I'm here to speak to
you today about, um...

109
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,120
Disability awareness

110
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:15,440
and what disability
awareness means t... to you.

111
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,440
I think the first
question I should ask is...

112
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,960
How long would you listen to me

113
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,520
if I talked that way the whole time?

114
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,120
Do I look normal to you?

115
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,640
Yes.

116
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,920
I'm disabled.

117
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,400
Can you see my disability?

118
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,760
No.

119
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,520
Who wants to guess
what my disability is?

120
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,200
Anybody?

121
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,360
You with the orange shirt.

122
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,560
Are you blind?

123
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,080
No, I could see your orange shirt.

124
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,160
You're retarded.

125
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,280
Oh, no, no, no.

126
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,000
Not your disability, my disability.

127
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,520
Okay, I'll tell you.

128
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,600
I'm deaf.

129
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,000
Go ahead.

130
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,840
Then how did you answer those questions?

131
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,920
I can read lips.

132
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,320
Plus, I have two little hearing aids

133
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,240
that you can't even see
unless you look real close.

134
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,440
And if I look straight in the
direction of the person talking,

135
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,520
I can hear them.

136
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,600
So you're not deaf?

137
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,800
Technically, I am.

138
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,480
I have extreme hearing
loss in both ears.

139
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,560
I also have a little button
on these hearing aids,

140
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,080
and all I have to do is
push that button once,

141
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
and I can't hear a thing.

142
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,000
I can mute anybody I want.

143
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,120
Now, you can't see my disability.

144
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,880
Others may have
disabilities you can see.

145
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,080
You would be amazed

146
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,360
at what so-called
disabled people can do.

147
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,960
What can you do?

148
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,560
Funny you should ask.

149
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,920
I am a two-time U.S.
Open swing dance champion.

150
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,600
Then show us something.

151
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,440
Oh, no, no, no. No.

152
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,480
Yeah, show us something. Come on.

153
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,440
Well, maybe... maybe I
could. Maybe I could.

154
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,160
No, no, I can't. I can't.

155
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,640
You guys really want to see something?

156
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,680
Yeah!

157
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,720
Allow me to introduce
my former dance partner.

158
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,600
Please welcome Corinne Kennedy.

159
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,880
Maestro, turn that music up, way up.

160
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,840
<i>Well, get up, get up, get up</i>

161
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,360
<i>and move your body to this</i>

162
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,640
<i>with a little bit of rhythm
when you're twisting your hips</i>

163
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,160
<i>Head swinging, honey, back and forth</i>

164
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,760
<i>That's of course because we're dancing</i>

165
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,440
<i>Sweat down the body on my backside</i>

166
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,520
<i>Acting a fool 'cause I
been sipping too much jack</i>

167
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,520
<i>Thinking of who gonna
be the lady I dance with</i>

168
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,000
<i>The mood is right, my moves are tight</i>

169
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,080
<i>Let's groove</i>

170
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,440
<i>Lady, let me feel ya</i>

171
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,480
<i>I know that you like it</i>

172
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,400
<i>Your body on my body</i>

173
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,080
<i>I'm so excited</i>

174
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,240
<i>What about you?</i>

175
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,320
<i>Can you feel me, girl?</i>

176
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,440
<i>Then move, do you want me, girl?</i>

177
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,440
<i>Then move if you feel the vibe</i>

178
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,600
<i>We're dancing, dancing</i>

179
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,920
<i>Lady, let me feel ya</i>

180
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,920
<i>I know that you like it</i>

181
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,920
<i>Your body on my body</i>

182
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,760
<i>I'm so excited</i>

183
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,840
<i>What about you?</i>

184
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,920
<i>Do you want me, girl?</i>

185
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,760
<i>Then move, can you feel me, girl?</i>

186
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,600
<i>then move, and if you wanna be free</i>

187
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,360
<i>then dance, baby, dance, baby, dance</i>

188
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,480
Well, that was fun.

189
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,280
We still got it, Jakey.

190
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,040
What do we have, Corinne?

191
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,160
Oh, don't you remember
when we were the best?

192
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,400
We were doing it together?

193
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,120
I remember a few more things.

194
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,080
Yeah, like what?

195
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,320
Like you have a boyfriend.

196
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,840
Yes, and you were my fiance.

197
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,040
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.

198
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,360
Hi, I'm Jessica.

199
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,840
I'm one of the teachers here.

200
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,480
That was so incredible.

201
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,960
I have never, ever seen these kids

202
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,680
respond to anything like that.

203
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,040
Thanks. They really seemed to like it.

204
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,120
I have so many questions.

205
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,520
What does the music sound
like through your hearing aids?

206
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,600
I don't know.

207
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,920
I turn them off when I dance.

208
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,480
Oh, really? Why?

209
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,160
I feel the vibrations of the music.

210
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,400
Oh.

211
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,880
That's why you turn
the music up so loud.

212
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,040
Got it.

213
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,640
And where else can I see you dance?

214
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,880
Oh, we don't compete anymore.

215
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,840
He teaches, and I'm a judge.

216
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,920
Are you a dancer?

217
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,160
No.

218
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,480
I mean, you know,

219
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,160
growing up, I did ballet,
tap, jazz for about 12 years,

220
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,320
but I, uh... I've never
done anything like this.

221
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,720
Want to learn West Coast swing?

222
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,240
Um...

223
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,480
actually, do you teach wedding couples?

224
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,000
I could have you and your fiance

225
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,280
swinging in no time.

226
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,160
Thanks.

227
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,200
Okay. We'll be there.

228
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,400
Great.

229
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,160
Again, that was so amazing, both of you.

230
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,080
Thanks.

231
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,960
Great sale.

232
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,480
Thanks for inviting me today, Jake.

233
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,280
Bye.

234
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,200
You're still the coolest
guy on the dance floor,

235
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,880
and then you turn into a geek around me.

236
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,600
Can't help it.

237
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,840
Hey.

238
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,280
Did we say good-bye yet?

239
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,280
Yes, Jake.

240
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,840
Ever think about competing again?

241
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,280
No, I'm strictly a spectator now.

242
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,320
Whatever you say.

243
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,280
Here we have Bob and Paula
doing a wonderful walking step

244
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,520
as Toby and Harmony pass on the outside

245
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,720
with a turning box step.

246
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,240
And here's the crowd
favorite, Gary and Susan...

247
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,800
Is it on? Robot Chicken, it started?

248
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,880
No.

249
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,200
- What the hell...
- No!

250
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,600
Come on. What are you doing?

251
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,760
Oh, okay. What'd I miss?

252
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,000
Ugh, I... I got to take this. Hold on.

253
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,800
Vader, how's my favorite Sith?

254
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,640
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

255
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,160
Just slow down.

256
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,000
Have you thought more
about our dance lessons?

257
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,200
Absolutely not.

258
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,840
But if that is what
you want to do, then...

259
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,960
- I do.
- I'm there.

260
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,720
I made an appointment
for us Tuesday night,

261
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,640
so please make sure you get off work,

262
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,720
'cause I really want to go...

263
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,800
Shh.

264
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,320
Okay, I take it I'm not supposed to talk

265
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
during the show.

266
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,800
What ever gave you that impression?

267
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,000
That's enough! That's enough!

268
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,320
This is serious business.

269
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,120
I'll shut up now.

270
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,360
No, you push off of me on beat three.

271
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,760
I'm trying. I'm trying, yeah?

272
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,160
Stop trying, and do it right.

273
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,960
Come on. Ready?

274
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,760
Hello, Gunmay and Ritu.
How are you tonight?

275
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,920
We would be fine

276
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,360
if she could get the steps right.

277
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,560
I see you're practicing the
sugar push, one of the basic...

278
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,280
One of the basic moves
of West Coast swing.

279
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,360
We know.

280
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,520
So how are you doing with it?

281
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,880
Not too well, my friend.

282
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,120
Okay, uh, let me see it, all right?

283
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,960
Five, six, seven, and...

284
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,720
uh, okay, all right.

285
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,320
First thing, you have
to wait for the music.

286
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,600
You have to wait for the music.

287
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,520
- You have to be ready.
- You have to be ready.

288
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,640
- I am the instructor.
- I am the instruct...

289
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,360
Sorry, Jake. This is a ridiculous...

290
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,800
Okay, time-out.

291
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,960
Ritu, can I lead you?

292
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,560
All right, good luck.

293
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,920
Five, six, seven, eight.

294
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,520
Walk, walk, triple step.

295
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,560
Triple step. Perfect.

296
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,800
Now you try it.

297
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,480
She only gets it right
when she is with you.

298
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,760
Tell me why that is.

299
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,800
Excuse me.

300
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,560
Oh, sorry. Wrong room.

301
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,920
You must be looking for Danielle.

302
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,480
She's parlor A.

303
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,360
Okay.

304
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,760
No, it's very funny.

305
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,880
I disagree.

306
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,080
You don't know how it is.

307
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,240
What?

308
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,640
You're saying I don't know you by now?

309
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,200
How long have we been teaching here?

310
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,480
Five years.

311
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,880
Right, and it's been the
same way the whole time.

312
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,760
The only place I could
control my stupidity

313
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,440
around women is on the dance floor.

314
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,520
Yeah.

315
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,840
But he ended up mastering the whip

316
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,920
like it was an art form.

317
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,120
I'll see you later. Okay, dude?

318
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,200
Jake! Hey, buddy.

319
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,680
- Hey, Keith.
- Hola.

320
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,960
Where you been?

321
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,240
Cheryl and I were volunteering

322
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,880
at an orphanage in South Africa.

323
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,560
Call me. Okay.

324
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,920
Keith and Cheryl.

325
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,400
I taught them when they were 12.

326
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,280
Yeah? You seen them dance?

327
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,880
They're incredible.

328
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,160
Yeah, they're just not normal.

329
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,160
Normal people have flaws.

330
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,280
Normal?

331
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,880
You are an idiot in
front of gorgeous women,

332
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,960
and me, I'm...

333
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,360
You're a lesbian who likes men.

334
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,560
Yeah, well, they're easier to talk to

335
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,280
and be with.

336
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,960
But I still am attracted to women.

337
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,640
Wow, Jake, you did pretty good
with me climbing all over you.

338
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,200
Maybe today is turning around for you.

339
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,080
Well, I didn't say stop.

340
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,160
Look, if you want me to fall
or hurt myself or something,

341
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,240
I will.

342
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,120
Don't press your luck, buddy.

343
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,080
And according to rule number 22,

344
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,480
you place the emphatic words
of a sentence at the end.

345
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,200
Please study.

346
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,240
I'd really appreciate that.

347
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,080
Miss Donovan?

348
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,480
Yes, Bri?

349
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,400
Why are you so sad?

350
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,440
Sad? Me?

351
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,680
I don't know. You just seem really sad.

352
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,800
Hmm. I don't know.

353
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,400
Okay.

354
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,320
- Jess?
- Hmm?

355
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,200
Hello? Where'd you go?

356
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,320
One of my students just
asked me why I seem so sad.

357
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,560
Well, did you explain to them
that the grind of this place

358
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,080
has sucked all the
happiness out of our souls?

359
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,240
Wow.

360
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,320
You're filled with
lots of positive energy.

361
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
Oh, I read a lot of Tony Robbins.

362
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,280
Yeah, all right, but
that's not how I sell.

363
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,120
I find out what the customer needs,

364
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,560
and then I adapt the software
to the specific application.

365
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,760
If I went in there

366
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,520
with the standard "our
stuff is great" speech,

367
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,120
would I be making 500 grand a year?

368
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,120
I don't think so.

369
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,560
What?

370
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,240
No, I find out what
the customer's pain is,

371
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,040
and then I tell them how our
software is gonna ease it.

372
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,360
N... no. Unacceptable.

373
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,040
Unacc... acceptable, not.

374
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,360
Unacc... unacceptable.

375
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,680
- Shh.
- It's also impossible.

376
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,360
You cannot pull a purchase order.

377
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,440
No one does that.

378
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,280
You can't do it. I can't allow it.

379
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,880
It's not only impossible;
it's unethical,

380
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,320
and it's downright rude is what it is.

381
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,400
You hear me?

382
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,640
It's... I'm... I
don't know.

383
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,120
Because I'm in an elevator, and it's...

384
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,200
I'm not getting...
it's... hello?

385
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,240
Okay, you have five
students in studio C.

386
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,960
Okay.

387
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

388
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,800
We're here for our
first private dance lesson

389
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,720
with Jake Mitchell.

390
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,920
Did I talk to you on the
phone? We're the wedding couple.

391
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,040
Oh, yeah, okay.

392
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,600
Yeah, you can pay for half of it now

393
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,240
and then half of it
next time you come in.

394
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,200
Listen, there is no
way they are pulling out.

395
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,280
What?

396
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,160
Money.

397
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,360
No, we are not... we're not...

398
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,080
we are not pushing this
to the third quarter.

399
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,440
That is craziness.

400
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,600
Third quarter. Whoo.

401
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,520
I've been there.

402
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,720
Listen very carefully

403
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,240
to the next words I'm
about to say to you.

404
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,400
Can you please turn that off?

405
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,920
Hold on one minute.

406
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,680
- Honey?
- Hmm?

407
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,240
I got to go in the office.

408
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,160
No, you're not.

409
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,760
Uh, what are you gonna do?

410
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,720
Is there any way we can reschedule?

411
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,720
Uh, we have a 24-hour cancellation policy.

412
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,880
I don't care about the fee.

413
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,400
I'm... I'm... look, I'm
about to fumble

414
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,680
a multimillion-dollar deal
with Rutgers University.

415
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,840
Rutgers University, I mean, they're...

416
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,960
Oh, my God.
What can I do to help?

417
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,280
Fine.

418
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,360
Go. I'll stay.

419
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,440
Are you sure?

420
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,320
Mm... hmm. I'll take the train home.

421
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,600
Thank you so much, honey.

422
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,800
I promise I'll make it up to you.

423
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,480
- Go.
- Honestly.

424
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,720
Okay, listen to me.

425
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,280
He's very busy.

426
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,920
You either get him
on the phone, help me,

427
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,240
or do an on-site presentation.

428
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,200
Uh, it's just around there. Studio B.

429
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,280
Thanks.

430
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,320
Bye.

431
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,560
Those are my glory days.

432
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,480
I would love to have
seen you back then.

433
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,160
Where's your fiance?

434
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,040
Oh, he couldn't make it.

435
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,040
He probably figured taking
lessons from a deaf guy

436
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,720
wasn't the smartest
thing to do in the world.

437
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,520
No, I never mentioned it.

438
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,520
He just had this huge crisis at work.

439
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,040
Well, how about I
give you the basics,

440
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,800
and you could fill him in?

441
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,480
If you can do that
with a phone in your hand,

442
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,840
he would love it.

443
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,440
He'd rather talk on the
phone than dance with you?

444
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,960
Amazing, huh?

445
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,440
Not exactly the word I had in mind.

446
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,040
So the basics.

447
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,120
Okay.

448
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,240
The basics.

449
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,760
Wow. That was fantastic.

450
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,200
It's my special move.

451
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,280
Okay, West Coast swing is
danced in a straight line.

452
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,560
- It's called the slot.
- Okay.

453
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,640
All right. Ready?

454
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,880
- Why?
- Step. Step.

455
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,720
It all started in the
1940s with Dean Collins,

456
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,560
who is considered the
father of West Coast swing.

457
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,040
He was asked to dance in a straight line

458
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,320
for the movie cameras.

459
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,080
So where are the movie cameras now?

460
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,880
The general idea stuck around.

461
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,040
So if I want you to walk by,
I simply step to the side.

462
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,800
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

463
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,160
Step, step, triple step, triple step.

464
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,440
- Good.
- All right.

465
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,120
- Simple enough?
- Yeah, it's pretty easy.

466
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,920
- Okay, let's try it again.
- Okay.

467
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,200
<i>I'm gonna love her as the day</i>

468
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,920
<i>turns into night</i>

469
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,240
Hi, I'm Brianna. Nice to meet you.

470
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,680
You too.

471
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,520
Hi, can I have an
iced coffee, please?

472
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,520
Sure.

473
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,080
Here you go. Hey.

474
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,160
Thank you.

475
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,240
That's great.

476
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,480
Hey, idiot!

477
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,080
Dude.

478
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,160
Sorry.

479
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,200
Just take the coffee. I'm busy.

480
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,800
Wow. Okay.

481
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,040
Happens all the time.

482
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,240
- Iced coffee?
- Yes, thank you.

483
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,120
Just so you know, he's deaf.

484
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,720
Ah, Jessica.

485
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,520
- Hi.
- Hey.

486
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,040
This is my new student, Jessica.

487
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,600
These are some old dance acquaintances,

488
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,640
- Lisa and Matt.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

489
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,720
Hi, Lisa, nice to meet you.

490
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,800
Hi, Matt.

491
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,000
Ooh, I really prefer Madison.

492
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,080
Oh.

493
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,600
What? When did this start?

494
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,800
Last week.

495
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,880
Lisa and Mat...

496
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,240
...ison.

497
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,560
Madison are competitors on
the West Coast swing circuit.

498
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,760
Oh.

499
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,280
Yeah, and I'm sorry,
but we have to run.

500
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,440
We were just leaving to rehearse.

501
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,520
So are you ready?

502
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,640
- We'll see ya.
- All right.

503
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,800
It was nice to meet you.

504
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,840
Nice to meet you, Lisa.
Bye, Matt... ison.

505
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,720
What's with the gloves?

506
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,280
Lisa's got major OCD.

507
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,720
Can't touch anyone's hands.

508
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,880
Wow.

509
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,240
Dancing may not be
the best career choice.

510
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,000
She's the normal one of the pair,

511
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,760
between her and Madison.

512
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,120
Hey, you want to join me?

513
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,040
Yeah, sure. Why not?

514
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,240
So after I stopped competing,

515
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,800
I got a job teaching
dance, and here I am.

516
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,000
So how often do you speak at schools?

517
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,360
Only five, six times a year.

518
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,600
Really? That's it?

519
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,680
You're so good at it.

520
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,000
I mean, notjust the dancing part,

521
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,960
but I would have never
guessed you were handicapped,

522
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,400
that you were disabled, that... you...

523
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,960
I'm so sorry.

524
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,080
What words do you use?

525
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,440
Hard of hearing, deaf, little "d".

526
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,560
It all works.

527
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,840
Little "d"?

528
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,160
It means I wasn't born deaf.

529
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,800
I had an ear infection when I was 16,

530
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,400
and at the swimming pool later...

531
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,840
So you must be terrified
of swimming pools.

532
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,400
Wow, nobody's ever
asked me that before.

533
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,920
I guess I am.

534
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,600
I definitely stay away from them.

535
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,120
Not just because of what happened.

536
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,360
- I also have chicken legs.
- You have chicken legs?

537
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,880
When I was younger,
I'd turn sideways,

538
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,720
and I'd hear, "Where's
Jake? Did he disappear?"

539
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,320
I was the official
skinniest kid in school.

540
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,560
Oh, my... I was the
flattest girl in school.

541
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,640
All the boys made fun of me.

542
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,720
Thank God for puberty, right?

543
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,040
Ketchup.

544
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,800
So why did you start dancing?

545
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,600
I guess I was happy being
the center of attention

546
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,680
on my own terms,

547
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,800
people looking at me

548
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,040
for what I wanted
them to look at me for.

549
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,760
I can't believe I'm
telling you all this.

550
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,640
Why? Are you uncomfortable?

551
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,320
Surprisingly, no. You?

552
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,160
Pretty comfortable.

553
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,160
My glasses are really dirty.

554
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,960
Uh, so I've got five more
lessons to get you and...

555
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,040
Kent.

556
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,520
Five more lessons to get you and Kent

557
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,800
ready for your wedding.

558
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,880
Let him know he'll learn
quicker if he actually shows up.

559
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,040
You think?

560
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,600
Yeah, dancing's not really his thing.

561
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,800
Well, we could change that.

562
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,680
Do you guys have plans
this Friday night?

563
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,800
No.

564
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,840
You do now.

565
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,880
Okay.

566
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,960
<i>We're going downtown</i>

567
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,240
<i>Downtown</i>

568
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,080
<i>Yeah, I said we're going downtown</i>

569
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,200
<i>- Let's go
- Downtown</i>

570
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,520
<i>We're going downtown</i>

571
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,680
<i>Oh, we're going downtown</i>

572
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,520
Whoo!

573
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,480
All right.

574
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,120
Want to do one more?

575
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,360
Oh, no, no, no.

576
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,960
Well, it's always a pleasure, Irene.

577
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,680
Well, thank you for
dancing with an old lady.

578
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,080
What are you, like, 45 now?

579
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,360
I'm 72.

580
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,240
Ah, 72 years young.

581
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,880
Yes.

582
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,920
I got to get laid tonight.

583
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,840
<i>What you want</i>

584
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,840
<i>you can't have</i>

585
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,000
<i>What you need</i>

586
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,080
<i>you better grab</i>

587
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,560
<i>'Cause there's a light</i>

588
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,280
Welcome, ma'am.

589
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,000
<i>Yeah, you got the
voices in the brain, baby</i>

590
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,400
<i>driving you insane, child</i>

591
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,480
<i>What you want</i>

592
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,760
<i>Ugh!</i>

593
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,040
<i>Tattooed gypsies are
dancing in the flames</i>

594
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,800
<i>When the angels sing their song</i>

595
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,600
<i>the devil whispers your name</i>

596
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,000
Hey, guys.

597
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,080
Hi.

598
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,160
You must be Kent.

599
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,240
Yeah, hi. How are you?

600
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,320
Very nice to meet you.

601
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,400
- And you.
- Great.

602
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,840
You guys want to get something to drink?

603
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,480
- Yeah, definitely.
- Yes.

604
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,040
Feeling a little out of place here.

605
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,520
Oh, don't worry.

606
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,880
You'll feel better after you're
in the dance contest tonight.

607
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,360
I'm kidding.

608
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,760
Frankie, whatever my friends want,

609
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,840
put it on my tab.

610
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,920
Sure.

611
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,320
Wow, you can really
feel the energy here.

612
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,760
Welcome to the Eastern Classic.

613
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,920
It's a small competition,
but it's always great fun.

614
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,760
Tons of social dancing.

615
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,560
So wait. What are
they doing right now?

616
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,040
Uh, this is the pro-am competition.

617
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,520
Teachers dance with students.

618
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,640
They're all just beginners.

619
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,880
You want to get a closer look?

620
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,960
Yeah.

621
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,360
Wait. Hold on.

622
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,240
Honey, come.

623
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,200
What? Come where?

624
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,560
To watch the dance.

625
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,240
No. I'm good right here.

626
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,440
Bar. Stable, safe.

627
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,000
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

628
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,760
I don't want to get
caught in some conga line.

629
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,200
Those things, they are dangerous.

630
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,600
People tailgate and... nah.

631
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,080
You go ahead, though.

632
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,000
Fine.

633
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,720
Can I get a Macallan,
please, a 25, if you got it.

634
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,760
Thank you.

635
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,680
It's cold.

636
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,120
<i>Do you remember when</i>

637
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,880
<i>you were 16</i>

638
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,200
What is your name?

639
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,120
My name is... can't! Kent.

640
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,560
How about a dance, Kent?

641
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,720
I don't...

642
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,800
My name is Frederic.

643
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,000
Yeah?

644
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,080
What's up?

645
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,200
Coming through.

646
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,920
Ooh, another step
closer, and you'll know.

647
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,840
Another Scotch, please.

648
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,000
I saw you checking me out.

649
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,720
You know, I can almost guarantee

650
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,600
I was not checking you out.

651
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,280
You don't need to play
games with me, Kent doll.

652
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,400
Can I get a double martini

653
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,040
and a blunt object, anything to...

654
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,520
Fred, we have to dance
in, like, five minutes.

655
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,600
Chill, baby.

656
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,200
Can't I take a break for a second?

657
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,280
No, you can't. Come on.

658
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,840
Jill's been waiting for you.

659
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,000
Get on the floor.

660
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,640
Let's give a big round of applause

661
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,240
to our pro-am division.

662
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,120
Greatjob.

663
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,240
Next up on the dance floor,

664
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,800
let's welcome our professional
strictly swing dancers.

665
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,600
You know, Jess, you could
compete in the pro-am division.

666
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,800
I've had one lesson.

667
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,640
I'm totally serious.

668
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,160
You're serious?

669
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,280
It does look like fun.

670
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,320
I... I wish I could.

671
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,120
That would be amazing,

672
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,480
but I wouldn't have time.

673
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,560
You could make the time.

674
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,680
Time for what?

675
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,240
Jessica's thinking about competing.

676
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,600
No, I... I mean...

677
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,840
I thought we were taking
these lessons for our wedding.

678
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,960
We are.

679
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,440
I mean, maybe I could do both.

680
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,120
You, my friend, are a good salesman.

681
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,240
It's how I make my living.

682
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,400
That's funny. So do I.

683
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,000
How are you going to
find the time for both?

684
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,040
Hey, look, if it's too
big a financial commitment

685
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,200
All right, excuse me.

686
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,840
It's not too big of a
financial commitment.

687
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,520
I make about 300 grand
a year plus medical.

688
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,000
They give me a card.
It's not a big deal.

689
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,320
<i>Now I'm standing here all alone</i>

690
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,960
<i>wonderin' why my baby's gone</i>

691
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:30,000
<i>way down yonder by the apple tree</i>

692
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,800
<i>you know</i>

693
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,040
Wow.

694
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,920
He's amazing.

695
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,600
- Stop.
- Hey.

696
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,400
<i>Way down yonder by the pumpkin patch</i>

697
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,640
Do you think I should compete?

698
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,000
I think we should get out of here.

699
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,480
Come on, honey. These people are weird.

700
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,560
Weird is good.

701
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,680
Weird is weird. Come on.

702
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,520
Uh, Jake, we're gonna get going.

703
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,480
Thanks a lot. It's been an education.

704
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,560
- Okay.
- Bye.

705
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,760
See you guys at the next private.

706
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,840
You know it.

707
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,920
What's wrong with you?

708
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,040
Nothing.

709
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,520
For... oh, God.

710
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,240
Uh, nothing.

711
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,160
Yeah, that's great, you guys.

712
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,240
- Wow.
- Yeah!

713
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,720
As ourjudges go back
to tabulate their scores,

714
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,680
ladies and gentlemen,
this dance floor is yours.

715
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,400
- Wait. That...
- Let me get that for you, sir.

716
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,480
That's a...
you went... you went to AC?

717
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,840
No, dude, if it was any other night,

718
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,440
we would have gladlyjoined you.

719
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,040
Foam party?

720
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,600
Stop it.

721
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,320
Want to dance?

722
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,200
<i>Hey, lover</i>

723
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,560
<i>please come home</i>

724
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:14,000
<i>Oh, my baby</i>

725
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,960
<i>please come home</i>

726
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,680
<i>I thought I saw your mother</i>

727
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:30,560
<i>just the other day</i>

728
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:35,320
<i>I wanted to know how you're doing</i>

729
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,440
<i>She said you're doing okay</i>

730
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:45,160
<i>I had a dream, baby</i>

731
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,160
<i>I looked in your eyes</i>

732
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,520
Enough.

733
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,600
Oh, come on.

734
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,240
You know what this guy was doing.

735
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,120
He brought you here
so he could hustle you.

736
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,920
I really like this, Kent.

737
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,680
I mean, if you can
stand there and tell me

738
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,880
you will take every one
of our wedding lessons.

739
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,160
You know I can't do that.

740
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,240
Come on, I can't...

741
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,000
I can't accommodate that schedule.

742
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,720
Yeah. No, you just don't want to.

743
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,920
You don't want to make the time.

744
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,120
Oh, honey, that is just so

745
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,880
- True.
- True.

746
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,960
It is true.

747
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,160
All right, you got me there.

748
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,320
Yeah.

749
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,840
Is that so wrong? You're right.

750
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,400
I don't want to bust out the Lindy

751
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,880
for my family or my friends
or my clients, all right?

752
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,560
Come on, I have a career
to think about here.

753
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,920
Well, I have a career too.

754
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,160
Yeah, I know you do, and
it's a very respectable one,

755
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,120
but come on, teachers are...

756
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,560
Oh, what? Oh, what?

757
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,600
Teachers are what?

758
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,160
Hot and socially pliable.

759
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,720
Where are you going?

760
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,360
I'm telling Jake I'm gonna compete.

761
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,160
Hey.

762
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,280
Hey.

763
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,080
Okay.

764
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,320
I want to compete.

765
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,400
So what about the lessons with Kent?

766
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,480
Oh, yeah, no, no.

767
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,400
He'll be relieved.

768
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,080
Are you stuck in the door?

769
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,160
Oh, this?

770
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,320
No.

771
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,440
Okay, so I will
see you at the studio.

772
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,520
Perfect.

773
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,800
Great.

774
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,760
Are you... are you certain
you want to do this?

775
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:28,040
Yes, Kent, I am.

776
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,080
Live the dream.

777
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,600
She was a student.

778
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,920
I would never sleep with a student.

779
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,000
I was a student.

780
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,320
You were a student a long time ago.

781
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,440
Oh, so now I'm too old.

782
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,920
- Kalle...
- Oh, that's nice.

783
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,840
Kalle, I
just... if you...

784
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,360
Just hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

785
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,440
Hi. Jake Mitchell?

786
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,800
Oh, yes. Studio B.

787
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,000
Thanks.

788
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,200
Was that your new girlfriend?

789
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,480
Listen right now. I am at work.

790
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,120
I can't talk about this,
so I'm going to hang up.

791
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,200
No, I need to hang up.

792
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,280
Kalle, I have to go.

793
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,560
I'm hanging up right now.

794
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,240
And inside roll. Three and four.

795
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,320
Five and six.

796
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,760
Oh, gosh. That's so much fun.

797
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,840
I love it.

798
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,120
Yeah.

799
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,200
Yeah.

800
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,120
All right, try the steps on your own.

801
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,680
So how'd you meet Kent?

802
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,040
On a cruise ship.

803
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,880
I was there with my family,
and he was there to meet girls.

804
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,520
What does your
family think about him?

805
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,680
Mom thinks I won the lottery.

806
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,600
It's too bad he couldn't be here.

807
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,480
He might have been a great dancer.

808
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,560
No.

809
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,960
All right. Let's try it again.

810
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,040
Okay.

811
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,640
Sh...

812
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,920
What are you doing?

813
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,720
I'm dancing.

814
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,080
Mm, dancing. Okay.

815
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,800
Kent and I are taking
dance lessons for our wedding.

816
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,280
Kent? Kent is taking dance lessons?

817
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,520
Yup.

818
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,040
Okeydokey.

819
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,040
Oh, that, I have to see.

820
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:32,560
So is there a future
Mrs. Mitchell in your life?

821
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,160
I guess you don't want to talk about it.

822
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,520
Don't want to talk about what?

823
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,600
The fact that I'm an idiot.

824
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,400
You were talking to me
when my back was turned.

825
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,720
I was.

826
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,960
Happens all the time.

827
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,880
I figured I must be missing
out on some great stuff.

828
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,520
I got to get these things fixed.

829
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,920
So what did you want to talk about?

830
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,040
Oh, I was wondering,

831
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,520
is there a future Mrs.
Mitchell in your life?

832
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,720
No. Well, once, almost.

833
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,480
Corinne?

834
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,080
How did you know?

835
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,960
People talk.

836
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,560
Really?

837
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,040
Yeah, they talk about you a lot.

838
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,240
Wow. That's so strange.

839
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,560
I don't hear anything.

840
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,120
That's the part you would be missing.

841
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,480
<i>What I find is peace of mind</i>

842
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,800
Five, six, seven, eight.

843
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,680
Very nice.

844
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,840
<i>When I see the way</i>

845
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,800
I said to him, "Oh, it's
the email that's stupid...

846
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,960
...and not you. "

847
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,400
And of course, he takes
major offense to that.

848
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,280
And that doesn't help my situation.

849
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,640
- So I'm just tempted...
- Can use you?

850
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,600
Software's been tested,
like, a million times.

851
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,800
And some secretary's not
gonna... about to screw up...

852
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,160
honey, look, I really don't
have time for this. I'm sorry.

853
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,280
Okay, but here I am,

854
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,680
trying to make a sale, and this woman,

855
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,040
she's completelyjeopardizing
it with her incompetence.

856
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,960
No, she should be shot.

857
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:52,000
<i>When I feel the rain</i>

858
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,760
Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't looking.

859
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,160
Not good. Blind girl, deaf guy.

860
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,400
- Let me start it over.
- Okay.

861
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,800
<i>When I see the waves</i>

862
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,520
<i>crashing on the sand</i>

863
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,680
Thank you.

864
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,960
Are you spying on me?

865
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,240
Uh, you need a better hiding place.

866
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,760
How are the dance lessons going?

867
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,880
They are so much fun.

868
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,040
Is Kent actually keeping up?

869
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,480
He is, actually.

870
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,240
Be nice.

871
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,040
Thank you.

872
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,400
It was lovely.

873
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,120
So tell us about this
little dance thing of yours.

874
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,560
Oh, it's been going so great.

875
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,720
We started with some advanced patterns.

876
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,520
Oh, any silver-level moves?

877
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,040
Katie, it takes years to
even attempt those moves.

878
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,800
Your uncle and I are gold-level students

879
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,880
at Arthur Murray.

880
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,600
- Wow.
- Oh, wow.

881
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,240
Why are you focused
on dancing, anyway?

882
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,080
Your mom's looking for some grandkids.

883
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,960
Now, why would you say that?

884
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,960
You Donovan women are all alike.

885
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,400
Uh, Carl, so when are we
gonna talk about getting me

886
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,240
in front of that I.T. guy of yours?

887
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,960
Uh, it's not that easy, Kent.

888
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,400
Really, for a gold-level V.P. like yourself,

889
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,200
I kind of find that hard to believe.

890
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,200
Would anyone care for some more wine?

891
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,280
Not for me. Thanks.

892
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,360
I'm good. Thank you.

893
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,880
I'll have another.

894
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,200
N... now, just do me a favor
and hear me out, all right?

895
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,120
What is the most important
aspect of a firewall,

896
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,240
as far as you're concerned?

897
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,800
Hang on. I got to take this.

898
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,760
All right.

899
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,400
So how are you enjoying
your dance lessons?

900
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,600
Now, what?

901
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,240
- Dance...
- Yes, dance lessons.

902
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,760
They... they're... ah, they're...
well, they're difficult.

903
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,600
Kent, can you help me
with the creme brulee?

904
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,360
Creme brulee needs help?

905
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,720
It's very heavy cream.

906
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,400
- Would you, um
- I'll go fire up the acetylene torch.

907
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,560
Um, ouch.

908
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,240
Ow.

909
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,600
It's my gold-level move.

910
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,000
Did you get a load of
what this guy was saying?

911
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,440
Here I am in the middle of my pitch,

912
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,560
and he takes a call?

913
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,080
He picks up the phone
in the middle of it?

914
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,160
How rude is that?

915
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,600
Oh, please. Are you kidding me?

916
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,800
Can you get the plates?

917
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,920
And this whole Arthur Murray
dance lessons... I mean, God.

918
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,360
- Yeah, that was weird, man.
- Yeah.

919
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,440
That was... what was that?

920
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,720
Gold level.

921
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,600
And silver level and golden levels.

922
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,880
I got to mind to...

923
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,280
close him is what I should do,

924
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,800
because he's family, and
it would be easy to do.

925
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,920
But it'd cost something,

926
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,240
about another 50 grand
if we did do that.

927
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,920
Well, you'll see him
at Donnie's wedding.

928
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,400
He wants us both to be
in the wedding party.

929
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,480
He does?

930
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,800
When... when... when
is that?

931
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,360
June 8th. It's a Friday night.

932
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,720
- You know why that's good?
- Why?

933
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,000
That is a good thing

934
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,960
because June 8th is still
in the second quarter.

935
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,560
Oh, really? It's
in the second quarter.

936
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,640
It's always about business, isn't it?

937
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,480
Of course it's always about business.

938
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,160
Everything's about business.

939
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,400
Oh, really?

940
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,400
Yeah, surely you've
heard of funny business.

941
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,120
You've heard of monkey
business. I know that.

942
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,600
Haven't you? I know you have.

943
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,400
Okay, Kent, why don't you
talk me through your pitch?

944
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,120
Carl.

945
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,800
All right.

946
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,880
Wow.

947
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,440
That was good.

948
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,520
That was really good.

949
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,760
- Really?
- Yeah.

950
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,040
I'll, uh, burn a DVD
of what we just taped.

951
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,760
Perfect.

952
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,400
I'm just gonna practice.

953
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,360
Great.

954
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,440
That's it.

955
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:50,960
<i>You want me tied up</i>

956
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,520
<i>bound forever in love</i>

957
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:59,720
<i>Your plans for me are made</i>

958
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:05,040
<i>Got a life together set in stone</i>

959
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,080
<i>but until you change</i>

960
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,880
<i>I'm leaving you alone</i>

961
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,440
<i>I don't want to be your valentine</i>

962
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,840
<i>and I won't ever vow to you</i>

963
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,600
<i>All your words I still see through</i>

964
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:27,240
<i>The only one stuck on you is you</i>

965
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,560
<i>my valentine</i>

966
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,440
Four, five, six, seven, eight.

967
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,880
Ah, that was good.

968
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,600
My gloves are coming off.

969
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,720
It's scaring me.

970
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,200
Hey, Jake. So what do you think so far?

971
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,600
It was beautiful.

972
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,800
Thanks.

973
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,240
We should do it again.

974
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,360
Want to get the end, yeah.

975
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,600
<i>I can't be your valentine</i>

976
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,360
<i>my valentine</i>

977
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,200
Okay.

978
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,960
- I want you to do the walk.
- Okay.

979
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,360
Hey.

980
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,000
Why don't you still compete?

981
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,080
What's up?

982
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,600
Why don't you still compete?

983
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,800
The champs are all kids now.

984
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,320
I wouldn't stand a chance against them.

985
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,320
They... well, you just saw it.

986
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,600
But you're a world champion.

987
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,240
No, I'm not.

988
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,560
What are you talking about?

989
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,800
You and Corinne are
two-time U.S. Open champions.

990
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,040
Not how I see it.

991
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,640
Corinne and I were
two-time second place.

992
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,880
The judges disagreed.

993
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,640
They wanted to give the
award to the deaf guy.

994
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,520
Hey, at least I got the sympathy vote.

995
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,920
You're not getting away that easy.

996
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,280
What do you want to hear?

997
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,360
You don't believe what
you preach in your speeches?

998
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,960
Jess, I'm just being a realist.

999
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,840
The champs nowadays are
all 18- to 20-year-olds,

1000
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,040
and they do moves that
would put me in the hospital.

1001
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,840
I think you can do it.

1002
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,120
I'm deaf, Jess.

1003
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,400
Yeah, and you use it as a crutch.

1004
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,480
See you tomorrow night
at Danielle's party.

1005
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,600
Okay. See you tomorrow night.

1006
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,520
You know, you should bring Kent.

1007
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,280
<i>Dance with me</i>

1008
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,240
<i>I want to be your partner</i>

1009
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,760
<i>Can't you see?</i>

1010
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,920
<i>The music is just starting</i>

1011
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,800
<i>Night is falling</i>

1012
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,440
<i>and I am calling</i>

1013
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:46,040
<i>Dance with me</i>

1014
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,720
<i>Fantasy</i>

1015
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,760
<i>could never be so killing</i>

1016
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,320
<i>I feel free</i>

1017
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,360
<i>I hope that you are willing</i>

1018
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,360
<i>Pick the beat up</i>

1019
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,800
<i>and kick your feet up</i>

1020
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,400
<i>Dance with me</i>

1021
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:08,880
<i>Let it lift you off the ground</i>

1022
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,920
<i>Starry eyes</i>

1023
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,640
<i>and love is all around us</i>

1024
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:20,560
<i>I can take you where you want to go</i>

1025
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,880
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

1026
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,680
<i>Dance with me</i>

1027
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,960
Hello.

1028
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,240
Hey, what are you doing?

1029
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,480
Hey, Dani.

1030
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,600
Just watching the video

1031
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,120
of when me and Jessica
won the U.S. Open.

1032
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,080
You and who?

1033
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,760
Jess... uh, Corinne.

1034
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,200
You've been drinking.

1035
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,360
How many have you had?

1036
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,040
I don't know.

1037
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,520
Five?

1038
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,160
Okay, let's just talk
tomorrow night at the party.

1039
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,200
Good night.

1040
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,080
Ms. Donovan?

1041
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,320
Do you know what the test is on?

1042
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,200
Ten principles of composition.

1043
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,240
Test on Tuesday.

1044
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,320
Please study.

1045
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,800
Wow. You look handsome.

1046
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,920
Thank you, and you look beautiful.

1047
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,520
Thanks.

1048
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,800
You're a little
overdressed, but I like it.

1049
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,320
Why? What do you mean?

1050
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,040
You forgot.

1051
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,400
Of course I didn't forget.

1052
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,760
Your dance function... what?

1053
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,240
Have fun with your clients.

1054
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,360
Wait. Wait. Wait a minute.

1055
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,040
It's been in my calendar for weeks.

1056
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,880
Seriously?

1057
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,640
Would I have booked a
limo if I wasn't seriously?

1058
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,240
Come here. Look... look at this.

1059
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:42,000
Come on.

1060
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,080
Oh, my God. You're insane.

1061
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,200
Yeah, for neglecting you.

1062
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,480
Now, come on.

1063
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,840
Let's go get liquored up
and watch you wow the masses.

1064
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,920
Okay, I love you, okay.

1065
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,960
Thank God for that.

1066
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,760
Yes, sir?

1067
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,400
Hey, I need you to rebook
Ichido for tomorrow night,

1068
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,760
and tell him... I don't know...
it's a family emergency.

1069
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,600
But do me a favor.
Rebook another limo, okay?

1070
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,400
Ready?

1071
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,440
National Weather Service
said we might get some rain,

1072
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,880
so we should get some coats and hats.

1073
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,000
<i>Here I am</i>

1074
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:35,480
<i>hanging out</i>

1075
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,480
<i>with nothing to do</i>

1076
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,800
<i>I wonder</i>

1077
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,760
<i>pretty lady</i>

1078
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:49,200
<i>will I party with you?</i>

1079
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,640
Hey, good to see you guys.

1080
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,000
How are you, man? Good to see you.

1081
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,080
Are you hearing yourself?
Are you hearing yourself?

1082
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,240
This is what I'm telling you.

1083
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,320
You're breaking up with me

1084
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,800
because I keep getting food poisoning?

1085
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,960
I'm breaking up with
you because you're bulimic.

1086
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,640
Oh, so now I'm too fat for you.

1087
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,720
That's what it is, isn't it?

1088
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,280
- No, no, it's
- Jake!

1089
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,560
I have to talk to you right now.

1090
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,680
Hey. Hey.

1091
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,320
We're in the middle of something!

1092
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,440
This is the problem.

1093
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,080
You never want to finish discussing...

1094
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,560
Thanks for that.

1095
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,960
I was actually trying to sneak by.

1096
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,200
Oy.

1097
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,800
So what was up with you
last night anyway, drunkie?

1098
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,240
I'm thinking about competing again.

1099
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,480
With Corinne?

1100
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,560
It's crazy.

1101
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:27,640
I know I'm not good enough.

1102
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,520
Says who?

1103
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,280
I don't know. Me, I guess.

1104
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,400
Well, you're gonna believe

1105
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,880
whatever you tell yourself anyway.

1106
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,080
Come on.

1107
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,040
Okay, she's gone.

1108
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,080
I dance. Whoo!

1109
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,440
<i>And I see the waves</i>

1110
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,040
<i>crashing on the sand</i>

1111
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,120
- Jess.
- Hi.

1112
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,560
Ah. Hey, how you doing, Kent?

1113
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,840
Good. How are you?

1114
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,360
Good.

1115
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,640
Yeah, I'm just here
to see the little lady

1116
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,720
do her stuff on the floor, you know.

1117
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,960
I am so excited. My
first dance costume.

1118
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,160
Is it still coming tomorrow?

1119
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,280
Yes, it is.

1120
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,240
Yay.

1121
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,360
Are you gonna be wearing

1122
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,200
one of those pink shirts
with the lightning bolt

1123
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,480
and you got feathers and glitter?

1124
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,920
- Yes, Kent, I am.
- That is awesome.

1125
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,200
Do you want to try our routine?

1126
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,240
- You read my mind.
- Yes.

1127
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,640
I'm sorry about yesterday.

1128
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,640
Don't worry about it.

1129
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,640
I think I needed a kick in the ass.

1130
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,520
<i>See my life</i>

1131
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:32,480
<i>and now I know that I have been so blind</i>

1132
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,800
Darling, would you mind
getting me a glass of wine?

1133
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,240
- Of course.
- Thank you.

1134
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,480
<i>Takes me to a better place</i>

1135
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,200
<i>and I don't need anything</i>

1136
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,920
<i>anything at all</i>

1137
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,520
Oh, Corinne.

1138
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,920
So I heard you and Jake
maybe would dance again.

1139
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,680
Really?

1140
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,560
That's the first I'm hearing of it.

1141
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,840
Hmm.

1142
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,880
<i>Yeah, take me to a better place, lord</i>

1143
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,400
<i>Take me to a better place, baby</i>

1144
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,800
<i>Take me to a better place, yeah</i>

1145
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,880
<i>Take me, take, take me to a better place</i>

1146
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,360
<i>Oh, I said, going downtown</i>

1147
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:16,400
<i>Lord, take me down, take me</i>

1148
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,800
Wow!

1149
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,520
That was awesome.

1150
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,680
I turned it up a notch.

1151
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:22,640
Wow.

1152
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,920
You were amazing, honey.

1153
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:24,880
That was great, and you...

1154
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,160
Excuse me for a second.

1155
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,320
I just want to talk to somebody.

1156
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,680
All righty.

1157
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,200
I don't know how we are
gonna make our reservation

1158
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,720
if we don't leave now.

1159
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,280
- Hey, hot stuff.
- Hey.

1160
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,560
So that's your new student, huh?

1161
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,640
Yeah.

1162
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,400
I think maybe you
guys should compete.

1163
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,880
We're gonna compete in pro-am.

1164
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,640
Yeah, that did not look
like the pro-am to me.

1165
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,600
You think you can get away from me?

1166
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,160
What part of "I'm
breaking up with you"

1167
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,320
do you not understand?

1168
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,800
What's that? What's the smile?

1169
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,280
I just puked in your dance bag.

1170
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,000
Kalle, I just broke those shoes in.

1171
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:05,520
<i>Senoritas make me want to say</i>

1172
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:10,880
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1173
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,720
What are you doing?

1174
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,120
I never knew you were so flexible.

1175
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,080
Do me a favor.

1176
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,560
Show me that dip that you did.

1177
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:25,600
No, you went back...

1178
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:26,560
What are you doing?

1179
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,720
We're on the street.

1180
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:28,680
Yeah, so?

1181
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,320
Kent, people are watching.

1182
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,440
- So?
- We're in the street.

1183
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,960
Jess, can I talk to you for a second?

1184
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,520
- Sure.
- No.

1185
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,560
Hold on.

1186
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,680
Hi.

1187
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,440
- Hey.
- Hey.

1188
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,680
Would you consider competing with me?

1189
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,640
I thought we were.

1190
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:45,920
Not the pro-am.

1191
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,600
I'm talking about the
title at the U.S. Open.

1192
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:48,760
What?

1193
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,720
I'm so excited that you want to compete,

1194
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:51,680
but with me?

1195
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,640
Yes.

1196
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,040
Am I good enough?

1197
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,920
Hell, Jess, I don't even
know if I'm good enough,

1198
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:56,880
but I want to find out.

1199
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,160
It's, like, one more round.

1200
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,920
I just want to see if I
could truly do it this time.

1201
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,360
Yeah, but why don't you ask Corinne?

1202
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,800
I think you and I have a connection.

1203
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:03,920
Jess?

1204
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,440
Okay. I'll be right there.

1205
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,480
Uh-huh.

1206
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,560
I'm not a professional dancer.

1207
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,440
I mean, I have a
fiance. I have no time...

1208
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:17,280
Look, Jess, I think you
and I can be champions.

1209
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,120
You have no idea how good you are.

1210
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,400
We'll work three times as hard.

1211
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:23,160
You'll be amazed at the
level I can get you to.

1212
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,800
Are you sure you want to do this?

1213
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,320
Yes, I do.

1214
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,800
I don't know.

1215
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:35,480
Jess, do this with me.

1216
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,080
I don't... I mean, I... I... oh.

1217
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,880
I... okay.

1218
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:42,880
All right.

1219
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:43,960
Really?

1220
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:44,960
Yes, I will.

1221
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:45,920
I have to go.

1222
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,080
- Okay.
- I'll see you later.

1223
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,800
You're crazy.

1224
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,920
Thank you.

1225
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,600
<i>Let's be who you want to be</i>

1226
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,760
<i>Like every day you're living
life as it's supposed to be</i>

1227
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,080
<i>Let's see if your mind is free</i>

1228
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,480
<i>Let the groove flow naturally</i>

1229
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,760
<i>Let's go</i>

1230
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,040
<i>Let's see if your mind is free</i>

1231
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,200
<i>Let the funk flip a beat so naturally</i>

1232
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,880
<i>Let's be who you want to be</i>

1233
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,760
<i>Like every day you're living
life as it's supposed to be</i>

1234
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,720
<i>Hold on for life</i>

1235
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,760
<i>Spins
out-of-bounds</i>

1236
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,600
<i>Such a beautiful day</i>

1237
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,360
<i>With a sound supply we've got the time</i>

1238
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,440
<i>Will you stay awhile?</i>

1239
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:20,600
<i>If the dream is real</i>

1240
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,640
<i>If I touch the sky mine fades away</i>

1241
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,200
<i>I get down in the galaxy
that ain't moving every day</i>

1242
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,680
<i>takes over me</i>

1243
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:31,760
<i>Take it over</i>

1244
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,920
No, you got to hit that break.

1245
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:33,880
It's on five.

1246
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,880
Oh.

1247
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,160
Most music breaks on odd beats.

1248
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,640
One, three, five, seven.

1249
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,760
You have to accelerate the
move to shave the beat off.

1250
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:40,800
Okay, let's try it again.

1251
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:41,760
Okay.

1252
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,680
One, two, and three, four.

1253
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,720
Five, six, good.

1254
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,520
One, two, three, four.

1255
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,120
No. This is gonna be tough.

1256
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,240
I'll get it. I'll get it.

1257
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,840
You're taking a mostly six-count dance

1258
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,160
and adapting it to
eight-count music, okay?

1259
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,360
I'm just a little nervous.

1260
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,960
You can't be nervous
on the dance floor.

1261
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,480
Why are you being so hard on me?

1262
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,920
'Cause you're not listening to me.

1263
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:00,880
I am listening.

1264
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,720
This is just a brand-new routine.

1265
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,320
Hold on. Did you just turn on your...

1266
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,040
Did you just mute me?

1267
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,400
No, it's the way I feel the music.

1268
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,720
You know that.

1269
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,880
But you're not listening
to your dance partner.

1270
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,520
It's not that type of listening.

1271
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,360
Well, how are we supposed
to have a connection

1272
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:19,440
when you're in your own little world?

1273
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:22,280
Jess, I can't change
the way I dance, all right?

1274
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,960
Come on, now.

1275
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,840
We'll move on to something else.

1276
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,280
You're doing great.

1277
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,800
<i>You know my love is true</i>

1278
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,320
<i>When your love is real,
what else is there to do</i>

1279
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,520
<i>In an empty room</i>

1280
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:36,120
<i>set my mind for you like I always do</i>

1281
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,320
<i>Let the dreamer be</i>

1282
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,520
<i>Flying how so good up above my head</i>

1283
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,880
<i>I get down in a galaxy
that ain't moving every day</i>

1284
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,920
<i>takes over me</i>

1285
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,080
Ms. Donovan?

1286
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,360
Do you know what the test is on?

1287
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,880
It's on caring, caring about life.

1288
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,920
Not caring about what
people think of you.

1289
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,240
Not caring about money.

1290
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,200
Wake up!

1291
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,720
Time is passing by.

1292
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:05,760
Your life is going!

1293
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:06,960
It's going so fast!

1294
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:07,920
You just need to wake up!

1295
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,200
That is what the test is on!

1296
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:12,720
It's on living! Living life!

1297
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,520
Ms. Donovan.

1298
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:19,280
I asked you if you knew
what the test was on.

1299
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:23,880
Elements of style,
the first three chapters.

1300
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,280
Hey.

1301
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,560
Mm, takeout again.

1302
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,600
When do I have time to cook?

1303
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:48,680
Excuse me.

1304
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,800
When do you have time for anything?

1305
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,120
You're never around here anymore.

1306
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,520
Neither are you!

1307
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,600
Oh, I can't wait until this
stupid dance thing is over

1308
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,800
and our lives can get back to normal.

1309
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,720
Nice. I'm sorry.

1310
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,920
Thank you.

1311
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:21,480
We'll be together
Friday night, right?

1312
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:25,480
It's still our date night?

1313
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,520
I invited Rebecca
and Curt over on Friday.

1314
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,160
Curt's got a new promotion at EMG,

1315
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,480
and I got to talk to him about it.

1316
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,840
We'll do it another night.

1317
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,880
I understand.

1318
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,240
<i>There's something in a song</i>

1319
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,080
That's it! Fantastic!

1320
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,480
<i>I am falling, and
there's nothing I can do</i>

1321
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,680
Okay.

1322
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:51,760
<i>It's come to here and now</i>

1323
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,480
<i>Don't matter why or how</i>

1324
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,960
<i>My heart is dancing</i>

1325
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,160
Very good. Great.

1326
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,680
Let's try it one more time.

1327
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,880
Ready? Five, six, seven, eight.

1328
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,040
Great.

1329
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,000
Now, I want you to practice
this everywhere you go.

1330
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:07,480
<i>I always dreamed of it</i>

1331
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,440
<i>I always wanted it</i>

1332
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:14,800
<i>I always hoped that it</i>

1333
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,080
<i>would be just like this</i>

1334
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,120
<i>just like this</i>

1335
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:22,840
<i>I never thought I would</i>

1336
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,080
<i>I never had it so good</i>

1337
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,040
So I have this idea for
the opening of our routine.

1338
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,040
Okay.

1339
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,200
Okay, face the mirror.

1340
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,680
Now, just fall backwards.

1341
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,160
What?

1342
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,640
Do you trust me?

1343
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:35,600
Yes.

1344
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,840
Then just fall backwards.

1345
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:37,880
Ready?

1346
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,200
And...

1347
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,080
Oh, my...

1348
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,680
- That's called a neck drop.
- Okay.

1349
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,760
We'll do that twice. Then
I'll grab you like this.

1350
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,040
Lift you up.

1351
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,320
<i>The world is spinning</i>

1352
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,760
<i>and it's all because of you</i>

1353
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,080
And, uh, put you back.

1354
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,360
It's just an idea.

1355
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,440
I like it.

1356
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,680
Kent, I'm just really not convinced

1357
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,160
by the latest test results.

1358
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,160
If it wasn't the
most compatible software

1359
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,160
with handhelds worldwide,
I wouldn't be selling it.

1360
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,480
Trust me.

1361
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,240
Jess and I, we want
to start a family soon.

1362
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,640
Don't we, honey?

1363
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,000
Sit down.

1364
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,040
Yeah.

1365
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:18,400
<i>I never thought I would</i>

1366
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:22,320
<i>I never had it so good</i>

1367
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:25,760
<i>I never knew I could</i>

1368
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:28,040
<i>have itjust like this</i>

1369
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,560
<i>just like this</i>

1370
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,840
<i>Just like this</i>

1371
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:38,800
Hey.

1372
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,040
What?

1373
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,000
That's not the pattern
you choreographed.

1374
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,960
Oh, had a brain freeze.

1375
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:47,280
Yeah. Don't let it happen again.

1376
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:51,000
<i>I always dreamed of it</i>

1377
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,520
<i>I always wanted it</i>

1378
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,080
Four, five, and six. Nice.

1379
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,320
I had the best day at school.

1380
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,680
All my kids are finally
starting to open up to me.

1381
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,120
That's so fantastic, Jess.

1382
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,640
- Yeah.
- Here we go.

1383
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,600
<i>Just like this</i>

1384
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:07,320
Whoo!

1385
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,240
You're all right.

1386
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,040
How'd I do, teach?

1387
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,600
Oh, you're getting better.

1388
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,200
Okay, good.

1389
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,480
All right.

1390
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,360
You look great.

1391
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,280
Those dance classes are paying off.

1392
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,320
Thank you.

1393
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,840
Is Kent a national champion yet?

1394
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,920
Uh, no. He's not dancing anymore.

1395
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,240
Oh, that's too bad.

1396
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,160
I had this great image
of him twirling you

1397
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,400
while talking on his Bluetooth.

1398
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,720
- Okay, guess what.
- What?

1399
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:38,960
I'm gonna compete.

1400
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,080
- You are?
- Yeah.

1401
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,080
With who?

1402
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,320
Jake Mitchell.

1403
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,080
That cute motivational speaker?

1404
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,040
Yeah.

1405
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,440
Oh, my God. That is fantastic.

1406
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:50,640
You think so?

1407
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,400
I do.

1408
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,120
Great class today, Ms. Donovan.

1409
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,320
Yeah, it was, wasn't it?

1410
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,000
<i>In a month or two</i>

1411
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,720
<i>met a beauty queen on a Saturday</i>

1412
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,120
<i>on an empty tune</i>

1413
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,840
<i>in a room we rented named Anne Marie</i>

1414
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,520
<i>Want to talk to her,
want to get with her</i>

1415
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,200
<i>Want to move that girl</i>

1416
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,640
<i>I can see when she blinded me</i>

1417
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,640
Whoa!

1418
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,960
That keeps happening.

1419
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:33,760
It does.

1420
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:34,920
So I watched a video

1421
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,880
of you and Corinne
last night on YouTube.

1422
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,280
- Really?
- Yeah.

1423
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,000
Hey, did you also see
that soft porn I did?

1424
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,920
I did.

1425
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,240
So what did you think?

1426
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,400
Well, I agree with you.

1427
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,040
There is no connection.

1428
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,720
And you can see that?

1429
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:55,120
Yeah, and, um, I can
also see it's your fault.

1430
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,760
It's my fault?

1431
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,760
Yeah, because when you
shut off your hearing aids,

1432
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,480
you're shutting out your partner.

1433
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,080
I dance better with them off.

1434
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,240
You dance alone with them off.

1435
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,200
Don't get me wrong.

1436
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,840
You're a great dancer.

1437
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,000
But you are out there
doing a solo routine.

1438
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,920
So you're the teacher now?

1439
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,400
That's what I do.

1440
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,920
I'll think about it.

1441
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,480
Look, I'm glad your
mind's on the routine.

1442
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,440
Tomorrow night at the North River Bar,

1443
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,160
the current champs are in town.

1444
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,000
You should come watch them dance.

1445
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,120
Uh, I can't.

1446
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,920
I've got a wedding to go to with Kent.

1447
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,240
That's too bad.

1448
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,000
Wait.

1449
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:38,760
What time will they be there?

1450
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:43,760
Perfect.

1451
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:44,960
If we hurry,

1452
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,840
we can make it to the
North River Bar in time.

1453
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:50,040
Can't this day just
be about us... and them?

1454
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,480
Don't make me feel guilty.

1455
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:52,800
Honestly, we talked about this.

1456
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,640
I really want to see these dancers.

1457
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,080
Don't you think that it hurts me

1458
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,160
that you're spending all
this time with another man?

1459
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:01,000
Honestly, no.

1460
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,760
Are you having an affair with him?

1461
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,960
Kent, I'm not
getting sex from anyone.

1462
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:09,080
Good.

1463
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,120
I don't want you to go.

1464
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:14,720
Hey, excuse me, buddy.

1465
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,160
Hey, want to get up here?

1466
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,120
Help us out.

1467
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,360
Come on. Come on. A little dance.

1468
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,840
A little dance. A little groove, baby.

1469
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,320
Come on.

1470
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,520
Okay, right this way, sir.
Thanks for helping us out.

1471
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,320
Here's your bag. You can
stand with these guys.

1472
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,640
I'll tell you what's going on.

1473
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,720
Ladies and gentlemen, if
you'll please take your seats.

1474
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,800
We got a little something
special for you this evening.

1475
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,720
Now, in case you're wondering
what the bags are for,

1476
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,040
what these gentlemen are gonna do,

1477
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,520
they're gonna put them on their heads,

1478
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:40,760
and when I hit the music,

1479
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,480
they're gonna dance
like nobody's watching.

1480
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,480
Okay, can you dig that?

1481
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,680
- Yes!
- All right.

1482
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,240
Now, this is where
the audience comes in.

1483
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:49,400
You're gonna cheer
for your dancer, okay,

1484
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,520
the dancer that's your
favorite, all right?

1485
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:55,600
Gentlemen, put your bags on your heads.

1486
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:56,800
Hit it, Kelly.

1487
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:00,400
<i>I want to groove tonight</i>

1488
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,600
All right, boys.

1489
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:03,760
All right, let's hear it.

1490
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,440
Let's hear it for the guys.

1491
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:07,360
Yeah!

1492
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:08,480
Come on.

1493
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,080
These guys are risking
everything out here

1494
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,960
for you people.

1495
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:12,920
They're loving it.

1496
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,000
Okay, guys.

1497
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,600
Okay, that's good.

1498
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,080
Okay. Okay.

1499
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,560
Let's hear it for number
one, dancer number one.

1500
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,680
Okay. Okay. All right. He's grooving.

1501
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,040
Number two? Number two?

1502
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,320
How about number three, folks?

1503
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,120
Number three, show 'em what you got.

1504
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,080
All right!

1505
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,480
Keep going, number three.

1506
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:37,360
Lucky he has a good job, Jess.

1507
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,280
All right.

1508
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,840
Yeah. Yeah.

1509
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:48,640
Yeah.

1510
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:51,120
Okay. Okay, guys.

1511
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,880
Guys.

1512
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,800
Okay, all right. All right.

1513
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,640
Okay, groomsmen, you
can take off your bags.

1514
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,440
Come on, he's a good sport.

1515
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:04,480
A good sport.

1516
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:05,960
Hey, hey, what's your name, buddy?

1517
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,280
- That was
- Kent Krandel.

1518
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,480
Kent Krandel.

1519
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,160
And where'd you learn those moves, man?

1520
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:14,760
Well, Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo.

1521
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,320
Thanks for being a good sport, Kent.

1522
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,880
Give it up for Kent, everybody.

1523
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,720
Rock star.

1524
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:26,320
Oh, God.

1525
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,120
Hee.

1526
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:30,080
How was I?

1527
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,720
You were foolish.

1528
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,080
But you handled it well.

1529
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,160
Oh, my God, I hope that
Bob Licando didn't see it.

1530
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,040
Well, if he did, I hope
he thought I was funny.

1531
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,000
I can't believe you make
a total ass of yourself

1532
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,360
and all you can think
about is Bob Licando.

1533
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,560
Total ass is what
pays the bills, okay?

1534
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:45,520
Don't forget that.

1535
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:47,240
My dad taught me that.

1536
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,680
That's no way to behave.

1537
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,440
A person should have a certain
professionalism and dignity.

1538
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,920
Shut up, Carl.

1539
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,560
All right, I'm sorry.

1540
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,800
Getting a little tipsy.

1541
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,240
Yeah.

1542
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,200
I guess you're expecting
me to drive us home tonight,

1543
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,880
so why don't you give me the keys?

1544
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,880
Joey C. said we could
stay in his room tonight.

1545
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,320
Does he have an extra bed?

1546
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:11,680
No, we're sleeping on the floor.

1547
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,160
No, we're not sleeping on the floor.

1548
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,880
Tomorrow morning, I
got a meeting with Bob.

1549
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,920
We're gonna lock it up.
We're gonna tie that sucker...

1550
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,160
Give me the keys.

1551
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,640
We're not... no, we're not going home.

1552
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:20,760
Now, honey, we're not going...

1553
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,000
Give me the keys. I'm leaving.

1554
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:23,000
Whoa, embarrassing me.

1555
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,400
Stop it... you're... give...

1556
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:25,880
Okay. Okay. You're embarrassing me.

1557
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,280
Woman, do what I say.

1558
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,880
All right, you want to...
you want to go home

1559
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,880
so you can dream about
your dance instructor?

1560
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,280
What is that supposed to mean?

1561
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,120
Nothing.

1562
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,360
Look, I can't do this anymore.

1563
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,640
I can't do this.

1564
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:43,920
What? What? Just back it up.

1565
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,640
What... hold on. Okay. Come on.

1566
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,480
We... we were on board.

1567
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:50,840
We... we were... we were
building a team here.

1568
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,680
Your team and my team are
not playing the same game.

1569
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,720
What? So you don't
want to marry me anymore?

1570
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,240
You know what?

1571
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:06,360
You're already married to your work.

1572
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:13,080
Kent, hey.

1573
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,440
Bob.

1574
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,280
Let's... let's talk
about my server problem.

1575
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,400
Let me... let me buy you a drink.

1576
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,360
- All right.
- Okay.

1577
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,920
I got a "serve her" problem.

1578
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,120
I just think that
returning a phone call

1579
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,080
is the considerate thing to do.

1580
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:33,560
But what do I know?

1581
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,240
Call me, damn it, okay?

1582
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,400
Call me.

1583
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:40,280
I need you.

1584
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,240
Kalle?

1585
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,200
Did Jessica call?

1586
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,800
Oh, uh, no. No, she didn't.

1587
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,000
No one ever calls anyone,

1588
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:52,200
because women are
ruthless troll maggots.

1589
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,560
Hi. I'm Bonnie.

1590
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,720
Two, three, and four. Under arm turn.

1591
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,920
One, two, three, and four.

1592
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,600
Five and six, sugar push.

1593
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,760
Two, three, and four. Dip, and five.

1594
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,320
Six, seven, and eight.

1595
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:14,880
And a one, two, three, and four.

1596
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,600
Oh!

1597
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,920
Go whip! Two, three, and four.

1598
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,200
Five and six, seven and eight.

1599
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:22,920
- Bon?
- Yes.

1600
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:25,000
Hi.

1601
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:26,000
What are you doing?

1602
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:28,040
Grading papers.

1603
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,320
And you?

1604
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,520
I'm having a crisis.

1605
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,360
Oh. Man troubles?

1606
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:33,320
Yeah.

1607
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,440
I broke up with Kent.

1608
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,800
I'm sorry.

1609
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,200
Are you happy about this?

1610
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,960
No?

1611
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,840
Look, I know you weren't
the biggest Kent fan

1612
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,920
Jess, look at you.

1613
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,080
You're wearing contacts.

1614
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,040
Your hair is down.

1615
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,680
You're beautiful.

1616
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,240
You're alive.

1617
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:54,400
Jess, you're happy.

1618
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:55,680
I know.

1619
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:59,280
Can't you see what's
making you happy?

1620
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,200
Dancing.

1621
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:04,000
You didn't really
need me to tell you that.

1622
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,640
But Jake knows the dance world.

1623
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,040
And he doesn't think we can win.

1624
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,120
Who cares?

1625
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,640
What do you think?

1626
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:25,000
Corinne, what are you doing here?

1627
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:27,160
I wanted to see you, Jakey.

1628
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,560
And why is that?

1629
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,640
Where's your student?

1630
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:32,440
I don't know.

1631
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,040
Well, I guess you need
someone to dance with.

1632
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,120
What does that mean?

1633
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,640
Just means I'm here.

1634
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:44,760
Jake, I think you and I
should put a routine together.

1635
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:45,880
It's not too late. We could...

1636
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,120
No.

1637
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:49,600
You sure about that?

1638
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,880
You really want to step
out on the U.S. Open floor

1639
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,240
with your student?

1640
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,240
Jake, you won with me.

1641
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,440
I don't see it that way.

1642
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,840
There's another reason
why I want to do this.

1643
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,520
What are you saying?

1644
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:05,040
Oh, come on.

1645
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,280
Jake.

1646
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,360
Wait. What about Terry?

1647
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:09,800
Oh, Terry's a jerk.

1648
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,320
Didn't stop you
from sleeping with him

1649
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:12,280
when we were engaged.

1650
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,240
Yeah, I was drunk.

1651
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:15,160
Three times a week?

1652
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,800
Don't make a mistake here.

1653
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,840
I am the best you are ever gonna get.

1654
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:23,560
Jackpot.

1655
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:24,800
What?

1656
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,000
I guess I hit the jackpot.

1657
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,560
I won you.

1658
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,680
Yes. Yes, you did.

1659
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,200
But it's too late.

1660
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,320
Fine.

1661
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,720
You won't win with her.
You're not good enough.

1662
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,320
You always made me feel that way,

1663
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:39,000
didn't you, Cori?

1664
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,720
I got to go.

1665
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,200
You really think you have a
shot against Keith and Cheryl?

1666
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:45,480
I've been judging them all year.

1667
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,960
You don't stand a chance.

1668
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,080
See you at the Open.

1669
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:52,240
Yeah, I'll be looking forward to it.

1670
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:26,640
Hi.

1671
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:27,760
Where were you?

1672
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:28,720
I was worried.

1673
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:29,960
I sent you, like, 20 texts.

1674
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,080
I'm sorry.

1675
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,160
I turned my phone off.

1676
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:35,200
Do you want to come in?

1677
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,120
Where's Kent?

1678
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:43,080
Uh, we broke up.

1679
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,560
Oh, I'm sorry.

1680
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:48,160
Yeah, it sucks.

1681
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,960
I thought a lot about what
you said the other night.

1682
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,160
Oh, yeah?

1683
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:57,000
The truth is, I got to
dance the way I know how.

1684
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,360
Okay.

1685
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,040
It's fine if you need to do that.

1686
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:02,320
- Wait.
- Hmm, what?

1687
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:04,280
Jess, when I saw Keith and Cheryl.

1688
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,280
- Mm-hmm?
- I don't know.

1689
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,720
I don't know if we can beat them, Jess.

1690
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:08,680
Why?

1691
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,120
They're incredible.

1692
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,480
- Yeah?
- They have so much polish.

1693
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,480
So?

1694
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:13,760
We could rehearse 20 hours a day

1695
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:15,000
and not do what they do out there.

1696
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,360
Well, who cares?

1697
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,440
The only chance we
have is our chemistry.

1698
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:19,400
Uh-huh.

1699
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,480
- Our connection.
- Yeah.

1700
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,680
Look, if we have this feeling

1701
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,400
and if we can get that
feeling to the audience

1702
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:24,680
and they can feel what we feel...

1703
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:37,080
What did that feel like?

1704
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,680
Feels like we could win.

1705
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,160
Uh-huh.

1706
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,400
<i>Whiskey, wine, and cigarettes</i>

1707
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,640
<i>Well, they're okay but
they're not the best</i>

1708
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:57,320
<i>Nothing quite compares
to that bathtub gin</i>

1709
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,080
<i>Drink it fast or sip it slow</i>

1710
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,160
<i>It'll warm you right down to your toes</i>

1711
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:04,840
<i>If you like it sweet, have
yourself a sloe gin fizz</i>

1712
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,160
<i>The lights go down</i>

1713
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:12,080
<i>The room begins to sway</i>

1714
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,920
<i>like a blue velvet dream</i>

1715
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:18,080
<i>The band starts to play</i>

1716
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,120
<i>Play it, Curly</i>

1717
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:22,520
<i>Across the dance floor</i>

1718
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:27,600
<i>a man's coming my way</i>

1719
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:28,680
<i>There's a light in his eyes</i>

1720
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:29,960
<i>He's got something to say</i>

1721
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:32,120
<i>If he buys me some
gin, it might go his way</i>

1722
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:33,560
<i>I'm not so bad and I'm not so good</i>

1723
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:34,600
<i>But if he asks me to dance</i>

1724
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,480
<i>I bet I would</i>

1725
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,400
Hello?

1726
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:47,560
Door was unlocked.

1727
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:51,560
What? Do you got a
problem with letting me in?

1728
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,800
You just gonna sit
there and ig... ignore me?

1729
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:55,080
That's perfect.

1730
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:59,480
Look, I just want you
to know that I know.

1731
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:00,640
I know.

1732
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:03,080
You and my woman, you
got a thing going on.

1733
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,560
Am I offending you? Huh?

1734
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:08,200
Am I offending the great swing dancer?

1735
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:11,400
Yeah, well, you go to
hell, Mr. Bojangles.

1736
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,560
I'm sorry.

1737
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:14,840
I didn't... yeah, I did mean that!

1738
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:17,320
You go right to hell!

1739
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:18,600
Sorry.

1740
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:19,960
I'm...

1741
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,720
I don't know what the
hell I'm even doing here.

1742
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,040
I'm the one having an affair.

1743
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:28,520
I was having an affair with myjob.

1744
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:31,960
Look, I'm gonna move
on, but before I do, I

1745
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:37,680
you got to promise me
you'll take care of her.

1746
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,720
Man, you are cool.

1747
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,360
<i>- Can you feel it?
- Yeah, yeah</i>

1748
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:50,720
<i>One taste and I wanted more</i>

1749
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:52,520
<i>Want to get back, get back on the floor</i>

1750
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,240
<i>Want to take this night to the maximum</i>

1751
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,000
<i>Find the right one and dance with her</i>

1752
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,800
<i>My heart beats to the bass and drum</i>

1753
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,400
<i>Feels like my pulse
and the groove are one</i>

1754
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,520
<i>From moonlight to the morning sun</i>

1755
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,280
<i>I'm gonna move my body
till the music's done</i>

1756
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:05,120
<i>Yeah, move it, move
it, shake it, shake it</i>

1757
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:06,640
<i>Move around, got to move around</i>

1758
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:08,960
<i>Got to move it, move
it, shake it, shake it</i>

1759
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:10,560
<i>I'm gonna break it down</i>

1760
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,200
I've seen you before, haven't I?

1761
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:18,640
Well, of course.

1762
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:19,600
I'm Danielle.

1763
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:20,800
You seem more normal

1764
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:22,840
than most of the people around here.

1765
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,640
Well, my ex-girlfriend might disagree.

1766
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,840
Hold it right there, Mr. Sister.

1767
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,280
You're a dude, aren't you?

1768
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,320
Are you kidding me?

1769
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,040
Oh, my God.

1770
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:34,480
<i>Won't wait, no, I won't wait</i>

1771
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:35,440
I've got to move

1772
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:36,640
<i>I've got to shake</i>

1773
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:38,440
<i>Move it, move it, shake it, shake it</i>

1774
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:39,760
<i>Move around, got to move around</i>

1775
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,960
<i>The music has got to me</i>

1776
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,440
<i>I got to shake it out</i>

1777
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,440
<i>Move it, move it, shake it, shake it</i>

1778
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:47,200
<i>I'm gonna break it down</i>

1779
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:49,000
<i>Move every part of me</i>

1780
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,640
<i>I'm gonna break it down</i>

1781
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:51,880
<i>Down</i>

1782
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,320
<i>Got to move it, got to move it</i>

1783
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:56,880
<i>You've got to move</i>

1784
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,160
<i>You've got to move</i>

1785
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,600
<i>Move</i>

1786
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,640
<i>You got to move</i>

1787
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:11,440
Give it up for Randal and Melanie.

1788
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,560
I'm so sick of dancers.

1789
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:17,720
Me too.

1790
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,840
I'm sick of women.

1791
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:23,480
Me too.

1792
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:26,040
Can I get you a drink?

1793
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,640

1818
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:07,440
Give it up for Bill
McGee and Courtney Stevens.

1819
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:09,720
Yeah.

1820
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,080
I would love to thank
all of our vendors...

1821
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:14,800
You screwed up that
second turn, Courtney.

1822
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:17,360
You screwed up my life, Bill.

1823
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:18,360
I love the dance world.

1824
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:19,360
Put your hands together

1825
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:22,520

<i>You want me tied up</i>

1827
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,760

<i>Your plans for me are made</i>

1829
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:50,240
<i>Got a life together set in stone</i>

1830
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:52,920
<i>But until you change</i>

1831
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:58,440
<i>I'm leaving you alone</i>

1832
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,600
<i>I don't want to be your valentine</i>

1833
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:05,400
<i>And I won't ever vow to you</i>

1834
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,720
<i>All your words I still see through</i>

1835
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:12,080
<i>The only one stuck on you is you</i>

1836
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:16,200
<i>my valentine</i>

1837
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:17,520
There they are.

1838
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:19,080
Keith and Cheryl.

1839
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:20,640
But they're just so damn nice.

1840
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:28,600
<i>If your heart won't give</i>

1841
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:29,960
<i>it only takes</i>

1842
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:34,760
<i>then I won't give you mine to break</i>

1843
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,720
- Hey.
- Hey.

1844
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:37,720
So the rumors were true.

1845
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,080
You actually are going to compete.

1846
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,760
Yup, this is my
partner, Jessica Donovan.

1847
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:41,800
Hi.

1848
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,360
So what made you
want to compete again,

1849
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:45,040
being this old and all?

1850
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:51,400
<i>I can't be your valentine</i>

1851
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,560
<i>I can't be your valentine</i>

1852
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:59,880
<i>My valentine</i>

1853
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:00,840
All right!

1854
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,520
All right, Lisa!

1855
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:16,200
Give it up for Matt
Connor and Lisa Knight.

1856
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:19,360
Oh, yeah.

1857
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:24,760
Madison Connor and Lisa Knight.

1858
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:26,000
God, Lisa. The gloves.

1859
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:27,480
Do you really need them for this dance?

1860
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:28,520
You almost broke my fingers.

1861
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:29,480
Yes, I need them, Matt.

1862
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:30,440
...ison!

1863
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:31,520
Mattison!

1864
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,000
You guys having a good time tonight?

1865
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,440
They seem really happy.

1866
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:35,400
They do.

1867
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,000
We have something special for you.

1868
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:40,320
Please welcome Keith
Miller and Cheryl Holoka.

1869
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,000
<i>- Yeah
- Yeah</i>

1870
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:47,600
<i>Welcome to L.A.</i>

1871
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:49,240
<i>city of dreams</i>

1872
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:50,600
<i>where it's paved with gold</i>

1873
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:53,480
<i>The streets at night
bathed in neon light</i>

1874
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,720
<i>like I just stepped into a dream</i>

1875
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:59,800
<i>I'm just sliding around,
the night's upside down</i>

1876
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:04,120
<i>To see the stars I
got to look at my feet</i>

1877
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:06,280
<i>The street's alive like a dragon</i>

1878
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:10,520
<i>You can almost feel it breathe</i>

1879
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:13,080
<i>The street bums and freaks
make the scene complete</i>

1880
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:17,320
<i>Yeah, viva Los Angeles</i>

1881
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,720
<i>Nighttime in the city</i>

1882
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:22,920
<i>It's got everything you need</i>

1883
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:24,640
<i>They're all strutting their stuff</i>

1884
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,400
<i>some are wanting it rough</i>

1885
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:28,200
<i>They all start at the top</i>

1886
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,360
<i>But I'm gonna make it</i>

1887
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,080
<i>As I pound my feet</i>

1888
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,680
<i>come on, look at me I can barely speak</i>

1889
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,560
<i>Walking through the
middle of a crowded street</i>

1890
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:40,400
<i>See, I was lost in the
rhythm but I found the beat</i>

1891
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:41,960
<i>Can't you see I'm waiting so anxiously</i>

1892
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,720
<i>staring at your hips
where my hands should be</i>

1893
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,160
<i>I move slick and I talk the same</i>

1894
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,160
<i>We can be our own stars on
the walk of fame, come on</i>

1895
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,280
<i>Out here on the dance floor</i>

1896
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:52,680
<i>where everything comes alive</i>

1897
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,280
<i>She got a license to fly</i>

1898
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,120
<i>She got a license to steal</i>

1899
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:57,800
<i>Bet she even got a license</i>

1900
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:03,560
<i>for her shiny, sexy red high heels</i>

1901
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,720
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

1902
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:19,720
Give it up for Keith
Miller and Cheryl Holoka.

1903
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:20,680
Good luck.

1904
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:21,640
Thanks.

1905
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,400
Thanks, Keith.

1906
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,840
Jake? Jake.

1907
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:28,720
I had to come down
and wish you the luck.

1908
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:29,680
Thanks, Dani.

1909
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:31,160
Of course.

1910
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:32,280
Wait. Wait. Wait.

1911
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,680
I have to introduce you
to my new girlfriend.

1912
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:35,760
This is Tina.

1913
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:37,800
She's very cute, but she can't dance.

1914
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,760
- Make sure to root for us.
- Yeah.

1915
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:40,960
Break a leg.

1916
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:42,400
He can't hear you.

1917
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:43,480
Come on. Let's go.

1918
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,280
You guys ready for our final couple?

1919
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,240
I can't believe it.

1920
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,000
I didn't do anything stupid.

1921
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,160
What does that mean?

1922
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:52,520
Put your hands together for...

1923
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:53,800
It means I'm in love with you.

1924
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,760
Jake Mitchell and Jessica Donovan.

1925
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:10,800
Way to go, Jake!

1926
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,560
Yeah, nice!

1927
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:23,240
<i>I stand here and wonder</i>

1928
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,840
<i>what's happening to me</i>

1929
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:27,920
You got it, Jake!

1930
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:33,160
<i>My woman is leaving</i>

1931
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:37,640
<i>How could this be?</i>

1932
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:42,400
<i>It was in the early evening</i>

1933
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:47,320
<i>I think it was in the month of May</i>

1934
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:52,280
<i>I was hanging out in California</i>

1935
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,480
<i>and a pretty thing came my way</i>

1936
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:59,720
<i>You're my lady</i>

1937

Bravo!

1963
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:55,160
One more time.

1964
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,480
Jake and Jessica.

1965
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:00,440
How about a big round of applause

1966
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:04,240
for all of our competitors tonight?

1967
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:05,200
You listened.

1968
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:06,240
What do you think?

1969
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:07,960
Should we bring them back out here?

1970
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:09,160
Ladies and gentlemen,

1971
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,040

01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:17,920
Oh, that was intense.

<i>It's living this up,
so do whatever you want</i>

1980

<i>Dance around, don't
matter if the rhythm is off</i>

01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:46,280
I'm sorry.

1983
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,720
Oh, okay.

1984
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:50,440
Step, step, triple step, triple step.

1985
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,720
<i>So much fun</i>

1986
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,040
<i>Dance and let loose, don't think</i>

1987
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:54,920
<i>The actions are based on animal instinct</i>

1988
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:56,840
<i>The left step, right
step, front step, back step</i>

1989
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,080

<i>Do what you want to do</i>

1995
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,600
<i>Don't be afraid</i>

1996
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:12,840
<i>If you want to move</i>

1997
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,760
<i>I lost competitions
'cause I lacked the skill</i>

1998
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,560
<i>Now I'm champ at the
annual Jack and Jills</i>

1999
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:18,160
<i>I send all challengers back to the hills</i>

2000
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:19,280
<i>Give them the chills</i>

2001
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:20,760
<i>Photographers flashin' the stills</i>

2002
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,440
<i>'cause that will seem
like a starter step</i>

2003
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,040
<i>Made moves all others would not forget</i>

2004
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:25,560
<i>So as not to slip,
I'm gonna tug my pants</i>

2005
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:27,480
<i>Adjust my stance, sugar
push, clutch your hands</i>

2006
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,160
<i>As we whip back and
forth like rubber bands</i>

2007
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:31,040
<i>I huff and pant in a trance
'cause I love to dance</i>

2008
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:33,880
<i>Do what you want to do</i>

2009
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,600
