1
00:00:32.657 --> 00:00:34.825
Oh, yeah.

2
00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:37.036
<i>Oh, you're so good.</i>

3
00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:40.372
Oh, yes. I am the best, baby.

4
00:00:40.456 --> 00:00:42.791
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>
Oh. Oh, that was a tit.

5
00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:45.252
That is a tit! Yes!

6
00:00:45.336 --> 00:00:47.296
<i>Oh, you're so big!</i>

7
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.673
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that's right, baby.

8
00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:52.676
<i>Oh, doggie wants to hide his bone.
Yes!</i>

9
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.678
<i>Oh, yeah!
I'm bone smuggling, baby.</i>

10
00:00:54.762 --> 00:00:56.847
Man, would you shut up?

11
00:00:56.931 --> 00:00:59.350
Hey, Jimmy. Just wanted
to say sweet dreams.

12
00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:01.351
Yeah, yeah. Sweet dreams.
Good night, Mom.

13
00:01:01.435 --> 00:01:03.311
Kiss good night.

14
00:01:04.772 --> 00:01:06.690
Something wrong
with the reception?

15
00:01:06.774 --> 00:01:08.066
Yeah. Yeah.

16
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.317
There's this nature show...

17
00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:10.736
<i>Take it off.</i>
...that I'm trying to watch.

18
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.488
And the birds
are all scrambled

19
00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:14.657
and I can't even...
<i>Do me! Yes!</i>

20
00:01:14.782 --> 00:01:17.326
<i>Baby! Ride me like a pony!</i>

21
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.953
The thing must be broken

22
00:01:19.036 --> 00:01:21.246
or I sat on the remote
or something.

23
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.497
Getting ready for bed, Son?

24
00:01:22.623 --> 00:01:23.749
Yup, I'm all set, Dad.
I'm all set.

25
00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:24.875
Yeah?
No! No, I think

26
00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:26.919
he's tried to watch
some illegal channels here.

27
00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:28.421
Illegal...
Illegal channels?

28
00:01:28.504 --> 00:01:29.963
This is just
bad reception, honey.

29
00:01:30.047 --> 00:01:32.049
<i>Oh, spank my hairy ass!
What's that?</i>

30
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:33.342
<i>Oh, baby!</i>

31
00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:35.928
You know what? Here.
Just give me this, please...

32
00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:38.806
Oh, my God!
And let's get this...

33
00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:42.851
Okay, okay. Let's... What the
hell's the matter with this thing?

34
00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:44.186
<i>Yes!</i>

35
00:01:54.905 --> 00:01:57.282
Illegal channels? Shit!

36
00:01:57.366 --> 00:02:00.619
If there's any channel that should be
illegal, it's that "all-woman's" channel.

37
00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:04.331
Yeah. Lifetime supply of
pantyhose or some shit.

38
00:02:04.415 --> 00:02:07.126
<i>Hey, did you</i> see <i>The Little
Mermaid on</i> TV <i>the other night?</i>

39
00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:09.920
No.
Ariel, man. She's so hot!

40
00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:11.588
She's a mermaid, dude.

41
00:02:11.672 --> 00:02:13.965
Yeah, Oz.
But not when she's on land.

42
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.970
Come on, Vicky, it's Stifler's
party. We got to go. It'll be great.

43
00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:22.308
Why? All that happens at Stifler's
parties is people get drunk and do it.

44
00:02:22.391 --> 00:02:23.683
Yeah.

45
00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:25.686
Now, come on, Kevin.
Open it.

46
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.064
It's a big, thick envelope,
Vicky. You got in.

47
00:02:29.148 --> 00:02:31.150
If you think so,
just open it.

48
00:02:31.233 --> 00:02:32.275
Fine.

49
00:02:40.284 --> 00:02:43.996
"Dear Miss Latham, we're sorry but
after keeping you on the waiting list

50
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.084
"for the past couple of months, we've
decided that you are now rejected."

51
00:02:48.167 --> 00:02:50.043
Shut up!

52
00:02:50.127 --> 00:02:51.336
You got in.

53
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.047
Yes! I love you!

54
00:02:55.591 --> 00:02:56.717
Okay.

55
00:03:04.433 --> 00:03:06.643
Hey, you think I should wear
this shirt to Stifler's party?

56
00:03:06.727 --> 00:03:08.854
You've worn that shirt for,
like, three days in a row, man!

57
00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:10.898
Guys. She said it.

58
00:03:10.981 --> 00:03:12.190
Said what?

59
00:03:12.274 --> 00:03:13.525
She said she loves me.

60
00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.861
Holy shit, dude! The
"L" word? Oh, man!

61
00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:18.364
Cornell's not that far
from U of M.

62
00:03:18.447 --> 00:03:20.198
Yeah, it's only, like,
seven hours.

63
00:03:20.282 --> 00:03:22.033
Oh, and you get to
drive across Canada.

64
00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:23.869
Beautiful country.

65
00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:26.246
Whatever. It's doable.

66
00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:29.582
What we should do today,
in band.

67
00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:33.504
Instead of playing our instruments
regularly, we should play them backwards.

68
00:03:33.587 --> 00:03:35.797
That'll be so funny!
Yeah.

69
00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:41.845
No offense,
but you're talking about

70
00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:44.932
a post-high school,
long-distance relationship.

71
00:03:45.015 --> 00:03:47.017
And you and Kevin
haven't even done it yet.

72
00:03:47.101 --> 00:03:48.727
That's not why
we're going out.

73
00:03:48.811 --> 00:03:52.397
What do you expect him to drive
to Cornell for? Milk and cookies?

74
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:55.066
We're gonna have sex when
he's ready and I'm ready.

75
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:57.027
It's got to be
completely perfect.

76
00:03:57.111 --> 00:03:59.738
I want the right time, the
right moment, the right place...

77
00:03:59.822 --> 00:04:02.991
Vicky, it's not a space
shuttle launch. It's sex.

78
00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:09.456
Finch. Here's the
man we are looking for.

79
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.500
Gentlemen.
What's going on, buddy?

80
00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:13.002
Same old.

81
00:04:13.085 --> 00:04:14.836
Finch.
You got the Latin homework?

82
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.254
Oh.

83
00:04:20.843 --> 00:04:23.428
It means, "My dog ate it."
It's Latin. It's a joke.

84
00:04:23.512 --> 00:04:27.599
It's a Latin joke. Yeah,
Latin. Just drink your coffee.

85
00:04:27.683 --> 00:04:29.267
You know, Jim,
it's mochaccino.

86
00:04:29.351 --> 00:04:30.352
What?

87
00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:32.771
What I'm drinking, it's
mochaccino. It's not coffee.

88
00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:34.064
'Nova!

89
00:04:35.691 --> 00:04:36.858
What's up, dude?

90
00:04:36.942 --> 00:04:39.235
You coming to the party
tonight, Ozzie, you fuck face?

91
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.405
Depends if my date
wants to stop by.

92
00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:42.740
I'm working
on something new.

93
00:04:42.823 --> 00:04:44.991
I got an idea
about something new.

94
00:04:45.075 --> 00:04:47.243
How about you guys
actually locate your dicks,

95
00:04:47.328 --> 00:04:50.122
remove the shrink-wrap
and fucking use them!

96
00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:53.834
Dude, it's gonna happen.
She's a college chick.

97
00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:56.295
Oh, right.
I'll see you guys tonight.

98
00:04:56.378 --> 00:04:59.381
I'll look for you
in the no-fucking section.

99
00:05:03.552 --> 00:05:07.639
All right. I'm shooting for a
9:00 ETA, beer in hand by five after.

100
00:05:07.723 --> 00:05:09.224
Breath check.

101
00:05:11.352 --> 00:05:12.728
Thank you.

102
00:05:20.611 --> 00:05:21.903
I wish
you wouldn't do that.

103
00:05:21.987 --> 00:05:23.989
So, you got something up
your sleeve for tonight?

104
00:05:24.073 --> 00:05:26.408
This is a foolproof plan,
my friend.

105
00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:28.994
I have a serious question
to ask you guys. Okay.

106
00:05:29.078 --> 00:05:32.289
You know Nadia the Czechoslovakian
chick? She might be there tonight.

107
00:05:32.373 --> 00:05:35.000
Now, do you think
she would prefer

108
00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.504
laid-back Jim, or

109
00:05:43.175 --> 00:05:44.509
cool, hip Jim?

110
00:05:44.593 --> 00:05:46.928
I don't think it really matters
with that shirt you're wearing.

111
00:05:47.012 --> 00:05:50.140
What? Correct me if I'm wrong
but you're the one with the girlfriend

112
00:05:50.224 --> 00:05:51.975
and you're still
stranded on third base.

113
00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:54.853
Hey, at least I know what
third base feels like, okay?

114
00:05:54.937 --> 00:05:56.355
You're still
just a batboy.

115
00:05:56.438 --> 00:05:57.856
Batboy. Batboy.

116
00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.232
What are you
talking about?

117
00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:02.319
Guys,

118
00:06:02.403 --> 00:06:05.697
what exactly does
third base feel like?

119
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:07.783
You wanna take this one?

120
00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:11.495
Like warm apple pie.

121
00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:13.205
Yeah?
Yeah.

122
00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:16.542
Apple pie, huh?
Uh-huh.

123
00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:19.294
McDonald's or homemade?

124
00:06:19.378 --> 00:06:22.130
Gentlemen, destiny awaits.

125
00:06:24.967 --> 00:06:28.053
<i>It's been one week
since you looked at me</i>

126
00:06:28.137 --> 00:06:30.055
<i>Cooked your head to the side
and said, I'm angry</i>

127
00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:33.267
That's number five and six
for the Stif-meister!

128
00:06:33.934 --> 00:06:35.518
Oh, yeah.

129
00:06:35.603 --> 00:06:37.438
Oops!

130
00:06:37.521 --> 00:06:40.106
Holy!
Hey!

131
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.360
Nadia! Buenos <i>dias.</i>
Glad you could make it.

132
00:06:44.445 --> 00:06:46.530
I'll be back
for you later.

133
00:06:52.786 --> 00:06:55.079
Now the party's startin'!
How you doing?

134
00:06:55.164 --> 00:06:57.583
Welcome to Stifler's
Palace of Love, fellas.

135
00:06:57.666 --> 00:07:00.710
The keg's back there! Enjoy!
Yeah.

136
00:07:00.794 --> 00:07:04.047
Vicky, Jessica! Great to see
you. Glad you could make it.

137
00:07:04.131 --> 00:07:06.633
Haha, bitches!

138
00:07:06.717 --> 00:07:08.427
Sherman!

139
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.970
What the fuck
are you doing here?

140
00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.394
Fellas! What's going on?

141
00:07:17.478 --> 00:07:20.814
Sherman. Not much.
Just scoping the babes.

142
00:07:20.898 --> 00:07:24.776
Indeed!
Some fine ladies here, boys.

143
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.113
Confidence is high.
Repeat. Confidence is high.

144
00:07:28.197 --> 00:07:30.616
Sherman is moving
to DEFCON 2.

145
00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:33.284
Full strategic arsenal
ready for deployment.

146
00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:34.370
Hey!

147
00:07:34.453 --> 00:07:36.121
You have something
going tonight, Sherman?

148
00:07:36.205 --> 00:07:39.082
You see that Central chick,
Bernette?

149
00:07:39.166 --> 00:07:40.250
NO- No.

150
00:07:40.334 --> 00:07:43.420
She's around. Seems
she's taken a liking to me.

151
00:07:44.129 --> 00:07:48.466
Fellas, it's time she
experienced the Sherminator.

152
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.802
Yeah, okay, Sherman.
Whatever.

153
00:07:50.886 --> 00:07:54.848
I'm a sophisticated sex robot
sent back through time

154
00:07:54.932 --> 00:07:58.727
to change the future
for one lucky lady.

155
00:07:58.811 --> 00:08:00.312
Go get them, tiger.

156
00:08:00.396 --> 00:08:01.480
I'll be back!

157
00:08:04.233 --> 00:08:06.193
Hopeless.
Completely.

158
00:08:06.276 --> 00:08:08.403
Hey, Vic.
Hi.

159
00:08:08.487 --> 00:08:11.615
Oh, shit. Guys, guys.

160
00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:14.910
There's Nadia and
she just looked at me.

161
00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:16.161
She just looked at me.

162
00:08:16.245 --> 00:08:18.997
Well, why don't you
go talk to her?

163
00:08:19.081 --> 00:08:21.208
Yeah.

164
00:08:21.291 --> 00:08:24.502
Yeah, you're
right, Kev. I should just go talk to her.

165
00:08:26.088 --> 00:08:28.882
Yeah, I could do that. Sure.

166
00:08:28.966 --> 00:08:30.092
Sure.

167
00:08:32.344 --> 00:08:35.263
Kev? Kev?

168
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.816
Yeah. Yeah.

169
00:08:48.736 --> 00:08:53.236
<i>At last</i>

170
00:08:56.493 --> 00:08:59.037
<i>My love</i>

171
00:08:59.121 --> 00:09:02.374
<i>Has come along</i>

172
00:09:04.585 --> 00:09:09.085
<i>My lonely days are over</i>

173
00:09:11.425 --> 00:09:13.260
That's great!

174
00:09:13.343 --> 00:09:17.138
<i>And life is like a song</i>

175
00:09:21.101 --> 00:09:23.561
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah</i>

176
00:09:23.645 --> 00:09:25.897
<i>At last</i>

177
00:09:27.316 --> 00:09:29.109
See you later.

178
00:09:29.193 --> 00:09:31.361
<i>The stars above</i>

179
00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:39.661
We're here for the party.

180
00:09:39.745 --> 00:09:42.497
What party?
There's no party.

181
00:09:47.503 --> 00:09:51.798
Weird. Try the house
down the street.

182
00:09:56.011 --> 00:09:58.596
So, what's your major?

183
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.723
Post-modern
feminist thought.

184
00:10:00.808 --> 00:10:04.770
Oh, cool.
Great night, isn't it?

185
00:10:04.853 --> 00:10:05.979
Sure.

186
00:10:07.523 --> 00:10:12.023
Yeah, it's just something about the
springtime that's just cool, you know?

187
00:10:13.028 --> 00:10:16.239
Like the smell of fresh rain
or something.

188
00:10:16.323 --> 00:10:17.407
Mmm.

189
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.869
Suck me, beautiful.

190
00:10:20.953 --> 00:10:22.621
What did you just say?

191
00:10:22.704 --> 00:10:23.913
Suck me, beautiful.

192
00:10:26.708 --> 00:10:31.208
My friends call me "'Nova,"
as in Casanova.

193
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.256
That's pathetic.

194
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.926
Jeez, you don't have
to laugh at me.

195
00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:39.470
Well, there's just some things
you need to learn, that's all.

196
00:10:39.555 --> 00:10:42.182
Like what? Well, you've
got to tone it down.

197
00:10:42.266 --> 00:10:44.226
You don't need to come
to a place like Lookout Point

198
00:10:44.309 --> 00:10:47.145
and spout off cheese
ball lines to be romantic.

199
00:10:47.229 --> 00:10:48.438
Okay.

200
00:10:48.522 --> 00:10:50.607
You have to pay
attention to a girl.

201
00:10:50.691 --> 00:10:54.945
Be sensitive to her feelings.
Relationships are reciprocal.

202
00:10:55.028 --> 00:10:58.531
Come on, Casanova. I'll
take you back to your friends.

203
00:11:04.204 --> 00:11:08.499
Vicky, think it's time to take
the next step in our relationship?

204
00:11:08.584 --> 00:11:09.668
Tonight?

205
00:11:09.751 --> 00:11:12.086
Yeah, it's such
a perfect evening.

206
00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:14.840
I mean, it's how you've
always pictured it, isn't it?

207
00:11:14.923 --> 00:11:17.133
Man, my farts
fucking stink!

208
00:11:17.217 --> 00:11:20.511
Dude, you gotta take
a shit! You smell like a yeti!

209
00:11:21.555 --> 00:11:22.764
Or not.

210
00:11:24.224 --> 00:11:25.600
Just relax.

211
00:11:30.105 --> 00:11:32.065
You actually said that?

212
00:11:34.109 --> 00:11:36.027
Shut up!

213
00:11:36.111 --> 00:11:37.946
You did a hell of a lot
better than I did with Nadia.

214
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.199
Oh, thanks, Jim, that's
great. That's really reassuring.

215
00:11:41.283 --> 00:11:43.868
Hey, no problem, 'Nova.

216
00:11:43.952 --> 00:11:47.747
Hey, don't call me 'Nova
anymore. I'm a... I'm a fraud.

217
00:11:47.831 --> 00:11:50.333
You guys are pathetic.

218
00:11:50.417 --> 00:11:53.336
I'm gonna find myself
a little hottie.

219
00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.798
"Suck me, beautiful!"

220
00:12:02.262 --> 00:12:03.221
Let me know.

221
00:12:03.305 --> 00:12:04.389
Okay.

222
00:12:04.473 --> 00:12:05.849
Keep going.

223
00:12:06.975 --> 00:12:09.644
I should be able
to talk to girls.

224
00:12:09.728 --> 00:12:11.896
I'm articulate.

225
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.357
You know, I got a 720
on my SAT verbal.

226
00:12:14.441 --> 00:12:16.526
Bullshit.
There's no way.

227
00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.321
I kid you not, man.
Look. Listen.

228
00:12:20.739 --> 00:12:24.075
Copious. Verisimilitude.

229
00:12:24.993 --> 00:12:27.954
Oh, oh. Now.

230
00:12:38.966 --> 00:12:41.176
Suck me, beautiful!

231
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.261
Damn it, Stifler.

232
00:12:42.344 --> 00:12:43.595
Checkout time!

233
00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:45.597
Please, vacate the room.

234
00:12:45.681 --> 00:12:47.766
You are such a jerk.

235
00:12:53.188 --> 00:12:56.065
God, I can't believe how many
cool people are at this party.

236
00:12:56.149 --> 00:12:57.233
Yup.

237
00:12:59.903 --> 00:13:01.946
And you got a keg too!

238
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:03.072
Wow!

239
00:13:03.156 --> 00:13:04.490
Indeed.

240
00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:12.916
Oh, wait.
I left my beer downstairs.

241
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.751
No. No. Here, babe!

242
00:13:17.587 --> 00:13:18.963
Thanks.

243
00:13:19.047 --> 00:13:22.050
You're really beautiful. Oh.

244
00:13:22.134 --> 00:13:24.010
Really?

245
00:13:24.094 --> 00:13:25.220
Oh, yeah.

246
00:13:40.402 --> 00:13:43.822
You know what? I don't
know if I want to be doing this.

247
00:13:43.905 --> 00:13:45.031
Doing what?

248
00:13:45.115 --> 00:13:48.034
You know, like,
if we hook up tonight,

249
00:13:48.118 --> 00:13:52.618
tomorrow I'll just be some girl
you go telling all your friends about.

250
00:13:52.706 --> 00:13:54.332
No way!

251
00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:58.503
Steve, you could at least
look at me when you say that!

252
00:13:58.587 --> 00:14:01.423
Look. Sarah,

253
00:14:02.174 --> 00:14:06.261
I wouldn't go telling stories
or anything about you.

254
00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:10.845
I promise. So, just relax,

255
00:14:10.932 --> 00:14:14.769
take it slow and
let the good times roll.

256
00:14:17.022 --> 00:14:18.356
Okay.

257
00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.691
All right.

258
00:14:27.449 --> 00:14:28.950
What's wrong?

259
00:14:31.453 --> 00:14:33.455
What's wrong?
What is it?

260
00:14:37.125 --> 00:14:38.251
Xenophobic.

261
00:14:38.335 --> 00:14:39.669
Oh!

262
00:14:45.926 --> 00:14:46.968
Regurgitation.

263
00:14:47.052 --> 00:14:48.303
I know that one.

264
00:14:49.721 --> 00:14:50.847
Kevin likes it.

265
00:14:50.931 --> 00:14:52.891
He likes getting head.

266
00:14:52.974 --> 00:14:55.476
Gee, what a total shocker.
What about you, Vicky?

267
00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.937
I mean, have you just
never had one with Kevin,

268
00:14:58.021 --> 00:15:00.064
or have you never had one,
period?

269
00:15:00.148 --> 00:15:02.650
I've had one.

270
00:15:02.734 --> 00:15:04.694
I think.
Okay.

271
00:15:04.778 --> 00:15:08.573
That's a no. No wonder
you're not psyched about sex.

272
00:15:08.657 --> 00:15:10.700
You tell me you never
even had one manually?

273
00:15:10.784 --> 00:15:12.118
I've never tried it.

274
00:15:12.202 --> 00:15:14.037
You've never
double-clicked your mouse?

275
00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.582
Ha-ha, nice!

276
00:15:17.666 --> 00:15:20.585
Jesus! Stifler,
how much did you drink, man?

277
00:15:20.669 --> 00:15:23.755
Hey, Stifler?
How's the pale ale?

278
00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:25.423
FUCK you!

279
00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.261
That's Stifler's mom?

280
00:15:30.345 --> 00:15:31.929
Yup.

281
00:15:32.013 --> 00:15:36.513
Shit. I cannot believe a fine woman
like this produced a guy like Stifler.

282
00:15:37.018 --> 00:15:39.603
Dude, that chick's a MILF.

283
00:15:39.688 --> 00:15:41.064
What the hell is that?

284
00:15:41.148 --> 00:15:44.067
M-I-L-F.
Mom I'd like to fuck.

285
00:15:44.151 --> 00:15:45.652
Yeah, dude!

286
00:15:45.735 --> 00:15:47.486
Oh, ho, yeah!

287
00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:48.947
Yeah! MILF! MILF!
Yeah! MILF! MILF!

288
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:50.823
Hey, guys. Guys. Guys.

289
00:15:50.907 --> 00:15:52.158
Come here.

290
00:15:52.242 --> 00:15:54.285
Sherman, what's going on?

291
00:15:54.369 --> 00:15:58.790
Yeah, don't you think you
fellas could try a little tact?

292
00:15:58.874 --> 00:16:01.626
I got company,
if you know what I mean?

293
00:16:04.754 --> 00:16:06.130
She's hot!

294
00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:14.180
If Sherman has sex before I
do, I'm gonna be really pissed.

295
00:16:15.056 --> 00:16:18.893
Sherman?
The Sherminator?

296
00:16:21.354 --> 00:16:22.897
Come on, man.

297
00:16:25.066 --> 00:16:27.735
MILF! MIFL!
MILF! MILF!

298
00:16:28.153 --> 00:16:32.115
Dude,hey,dude. What
are you doing to her, dude?

299
00:16:32.199 --> 00:16:34.576
Oh, my God, bro. Dude.

300
00:16:35.994 --> 00:16:38.037
Enough of this
blow job bullshit.

301
00:16:38.121 --> 00:16:39.497
I gotta get laid already.

302
00:16:39.581 --> 00:16:42.542
That's nice.
Really, really nice.

303
00:16:42.626 --> 00:16:44.669
Can I have a ride?
Sure.

304
00:16:45.962 --> 00:16:48.047
Vicky, wait.
Not for you.

305
00:16:49.633 --> 00:16:52.886
Yeti! I am the Yeti!

306
00:17:02.229 --> 00:17:04.189
Good morning, gentlemen.
Finch.

307
00:17:04.272 --> 00:17:05.606
Where were you
last night, huh?

308
00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:07.441
What happened to that
foolproof plan of yours?

309
00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:12.026
Well, I was going for a fashionably-late
entrance and I was too late.

310
00:17:12.572 --> 00:17:14.115
So, no ladies left.

311
00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:16.743
It was a very
special night, very special.

312
00:17:17.953 --> 00:17:19.329
Guys. Guys.

313
00:17:22.249 --> 00:17:23.708
I'll never forget this.

314
00:17:23.792 --> 00:17:26.085
Oh, I'll never forget it,
either.

315
00:17:26.169 --> 00:17:27.670
Thank you.

316
00:17:30.924 --> 00:17:32.926
Well, bye.

317
00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:35.637
Bye.

318
00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:42.560
Fellas, say goodbye
to Chuck Sherman, the boy.

319
00:17:42.644 --> 00:17:45.355
I am now a man.

320
00:17:45.438 --> 00:17:47.731
I highly recommend
you join the club.

321
00:17:47.816 --> 00:17:52.316
We were doing the wild
thing all night. I'm exhausted.

322
00:17:53.154 --> 00:17:56.031
I don't get it. I mean, how
the hell did you do that?

323
00:17:57.659 --> 00:18:00.828
It was just my time.
It was just my time.

324
00:18:02.622 --> 00:18:04.665
Best of luck
to you boys.

325
00:18:07.335 --> 00:18:09.545
- I cannot believe this.
- Come on, guys.

326
00:18:09.629 --> 00:18:12.340
You know, we should
be happy for Sherman.

327
00:18:15.343 --> 00:18:17.053
No, we shouldn't be.

328
00:18:17.137 --> 00:18:19.597
You know, I put in months
of quality time with Vicky.

329
00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:22.600
Sherman meets a chick
for one night and scores.

330
00:18:22.684 --> 00:18:23.685
This is just wrong.

331
00:18:23.768 --> 00:18:25.436
No shit.

332
00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.523
How the hell am I supposed
to become Mr. Sensitive Man?

333
00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:32.444
You know, we're all gonna go to college
as virgins. You realize this, right?

334
00:18:32.527 --> 00:18:35.112
I mean, they probably have
special dorms for people like us.

335
00:18:35.196 --> 00:18:39.696
All right. I got an idea. But
it's got to stay between us.

336
00:18:40.201 --> 00:18:42.494
It's really simple. We just
got to make an agreement.

337
00:18:42.579 --> 00:18:45.456
No. It's more than
an agreement.

338
00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.041
What? A bet?
A pact.

339
00:18:47.125 --> 00:18:49.627
No money involved. More
important than any bet.

340
00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:53.214
Here's the deal. We all
get laid before we graduate.

341
00:18:54.758 --> 00:18:57.761
Dude, it's not like I haven't
been trying to get laid.

342
00:18:58.011 --> 00:18:59.429
Think about when
you work out, Oz.

343
00:18:59.512 --> 00:19:00.930
You gotta have
someone there, right?

344
00:19:01.014 --> 00:19:03.975
Someone to spot you.
Someone to keep you motivated.

345
00:19:04.059 --> 00:19:06.311
Well, that's exactly what
we can do for each other.

346
00:19:06.394 --> 00:19:08.813
I mean, we'll be there
to keep each other on track.

347
00:19:08.897 --> 00:19:11.024
Separately, we are flawed
and vulnerable, but together,

348
00:19:11.107 --> 00:19:13.484
we are the masters
of our sexual destiny.

349
00:19:13.568 --> 00:19:15.820
Their tiger-style kung fu is strong.

350
00:19:15.904 --> 00:19:17.405
But our dragon-style
will defeat it.

351
00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:19.073
Guys!
The Shaolin masters

352
00:19:19.157 --> 00:19:21.159
from East and West
must unite!

353
00:19:21.242 --> 00:19:23.619
Fight, and find out who
is number one. Guys!

354
00:19:23.703 --> 00:19:25.996
Come on. You're
ruining my moment here.

355
00:19:26.081 --> 00:19:28.792
This is our
very manhood at stake.

356
00:19:28.875 --> 00:19:31.419
We must make a stand,
here and now.

357
00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:36.090
No longer will our penises
remain flaccid and unused!

358
00:19:36.174 --> 00:19:40.261
We will fight for every man out there
who isn't getting laid and should be.

359
00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:43.890
This is our day.
This is our time.

360
00:19:43.973 --> 00:19:48.185
And, by God, we will not stand by and
watch history condemn us into celibacy.

361
00:19:48.269 --> 00:19:49.853
Amen. Yes.
I like that.

362
00:19:49.938 --> 00:19:53.858
We will make a stand. We
will succeed. About time!

363
00:19:53.942 --> 00:19:56.027
We will get laid!

364
00:19:56.111 --> 00:19:57.237
Yeah!

365
00:19:59.155 --> 00:20:02.408
Now, the sex. It's got to
be valid, consensual sex.

366
00:20:02.492 --> 00:20:05.620
No prostitutes. That's
what you're thinking, Finch.

367
00:20:06.454 --> 00:20:07.997
Busted.

368
00:20:08.081 --> 00:20:10.833
So, basically,
prom is our last chance.

369
00:20:10.917 --> 00:20:13.377
Oh, dude. Prom sucks.
I know,

370
00:20:13.461 --> 00:20:15.463
but you gotta
think about it this way.

371
00:20:15.547 --> 00:20:17.090
I mean,
all the parties afterwards?

372
00:20:17.173 --> 00:20:18.799
The chicks are going to
want to do it.

373
00:20:18.883 --> 00:20:22.386
Yeah, yeah, he's right. It's,
like, tradition or something.

374
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:23.804
The Rose Bowl.

375
00:20:23.888 --> 00:20:25.514
So, that gives us...

376
00:20:25.598 --> 00:20:27.683
Exactly three weeks
to the day.

377
00:20:29.811 --> 00:20:32.104
We're gonna do this.
All right, to the next step!

378
00:20:32.188 --> 00:20:34.064
Next step!
Next step!

379
00:20:36.109 --> 00:20:40.609
<i>I have visions I was in them
I was looking into the mirror</i>

380
00:20:40.947 --> 00:20:43.824
<i>To see a little
bit clearer</i>

381
00:20:43.908 --> 00:20:46.660
<i>The rottenness
and evil in me</i>

382
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:53.330
<i>Fingertips have memories Mine
can't forget the curves of your body</i>

383
00:20:53.501 --> 00:20:56.879
<i>And when
I feel a bit naughty</i>

384
00:20:57.172 --> 00:20:59.716
<i>I run it up the flagpole
and see</i>

385
00:20:59.799 --> 00:21:02.885
<i>Who salutes
but no one ever does</i>

386
00:21:02.969 --> 00:21:07.469
<i>I'm not sick,
but I'm not well</i>

387
00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.934
<i>And I'm so hot</i>

388
00:21:11.019 --> 00:21:13.980
<i>'Cause I'm in hell</i>

389
00:21:15.148 --> 00:21:19.648
<i>Been around the world and found
that only stupid people are breeding</i>

390
00:21:20.361 --> 00:21:24.323
<i>The cretins cloning and
feeding and I don't even own a TV</i>

391
00:21:24.407 --> 00:21:26.033
Well, did you get
the flowers?

392
00:21:28.369 --> 00:21:30.913
<i>Hear the voices in my head,
I swear to God</i>

393
00:21:30.997 --> 00:21:33.791
<i>It sounds like
they're snoring</i>

394
00:21:33.875 --> 00:21:36.377
<i>But if you're bored,
then you're boring</i>

395
00:21:36.961 --> 00:21:39.546
<i>The agony and the irony</i>

396
00:21:39.631 --> 00:21:42.675
<i>They're killing me, whoa!</i>

397
00:21:42.759 --> 00:21:47.138
<i>I'm not sick,
but I'm not well</i>

398
00:21:47.222 --> 00:21:50.600
<i>And I'm so hot</i>

399
00:21:50.683 --> 00:21:53.060
<i>'Cause I'm in hell</i>

400
00:21:54.771 --> 00:21:56.773
Don't worry. You'll get
her back soon enough.

401
00:21:56.856 --> 00:21:58.941
You think so?
Sure, she likes you.

402
00:21:59.025 --> 00:22:00.609
Well, I like her too.

403
00:22:00.693 --> 00:22:02.444
Do you love her?

404
00:22:02.529 --> 00:22:05.323
You know what? You
can't really ask me that.

405
00:22:05.406 --> 00:22:08.575
Well, if you want to get her in the
sack, I mean, just tell her you love her.

406
00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.119
That's how I was duped.

407
00:22:10.203 --> 00:22:11.454
Look, Jessica,

408
00:22:11.538 --> 00:22:13.581
I don't want to dupe her.

409
00:22:15.375 --> 00:22:19.462
All right. What you need to do is
learn how to press a girl's buttons.

410
00:22:19.546 --> 00:22:21.256
You have to give her
what she's never had.

411
00:22:21.339 --> 00:22:22.757
What's that?

412
00:22:22.966 --> 00:22:24.592
Let me give you a hint.

413
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:28.804
Oh, Kev! Yeah.

414
00:22:29.597 --> 00:22:32.266
¿Comprende?
You mean an orgasm.

415
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:34.602
You got it, stud!
Well, you know,

416
00:22:34.686 --> 00:22:36.729
I'm... I'm pretty sure
that I've given her a...

417
00:22:36.813 --> 00:22:38.689
No, you haven't.

418
00:22:38.773 --> 00:22:41.525
Well, there was one time...
No.

419
00:22:42.902 --> 00:22:43.903
Oh, man.

420
00:22:43.987 --> 00:22:45.238
Look, kid, it's up to you.

421
00:22:45.321 --> 00:22:48.282
The big L or the big O.

422
00:22:48.783 --> 00:22:50.075
Dickhead!

423
00:22:50.493 --> 00:22:52.578
You gotta see this.

424
00:22:52.662 --> 00:22:54.455
<i>Do you believe in magic</i>

425
00:22:54.539 --> 00:22:55.873
<i>In a young girl's heart</i>

426
00:22:55.957 --> 00:22:59.460
<i>How the music can free her
whenever it starts</i>

427
00:22:59.586 --> 00:23:03.339
<i>And it's magic
if the music is groovy</i>

428
00:23:03.423 --> 00:23:04.966
<i>It makes you feel happy</i>

429
00:23:05.049 --> 00:23:06.842
What did you cocks
do to him?

430
00:23:06.926 --> 00:23:09.678
<i>I'll tell you about the
magic It'll free your soul</i>

431
00:23:09.762 --> 00:23:14.262
<i>But it's like trying to tell a
stranger 'bout rock 'n' roll</i>

432
00:23:14.392 --> 00:23:16.435
Great. See you next time.

433
00:23:21.024 --> 00:23:22.942
Hey, guys.
Came to watch me in action?

434
00:23:23.026 --> 00:23:24.068
Yeah.

435
00:23:24.152 --> 00:23:25.570
I think you sounded
pretty good.

436
00:23:25.653 --> 00:23:26.779
Yeah, man.

437
00:23:26.863 --> 00:23:28.948
I think you need
your balls reattached.

438
00:23:29.032 --> 00:23:30.450
Hey, keep it down, dude.

439
00:23:30.533 --> 00:23:31.992
What the fuck
are you doing here?

440
00:23:32.076 --> 00:23:34.703
This place is an
untapped resource.

441
00:23:34.787 --> 00:23:36.121
I mean, check it out.

442
00:23:36.205 --> 00:23:38.415
These vocal jazz girls
are hot.

443
00:23:38.499 --> 00:23:41.335
Why the hell is he
joining jazz choir so late?

444
00:23:41.419 --> 00:23:44.880
Maybe he's preparing for
another senior year at East?

445
00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:47.717
You guys,
we don't even know him.

446
00:23:51.387 --> 00:23:52.888
You dipshit!

447
00:23:52.972 --> 00:23:56.725
You're expecting to score with
some goody-goody choir girl pries?

448
00:23:56.809 --> 00:24:01.309
These chicks don't know me. I can
work the sensitive angle here, fellas!

449
00:24:01.481 --> 00:24:03.900
You know, it's just like
that college chick told me.

450
00:24:03.983 --> 00:24:06.944
All that you gotta do
is just ask them questions

451
00:24:07.028 --> 00:24:09.321
and listen to what
they have to say and shit.

452
00:24:09.405 --> 00:24:12.658
I don't know, man. That
sounds like a lot of work!

453
00:24:17.038 --> 00:24:18.581
Just a second!

454
00:24:23.544 --> 00:24:25.879
Come in. Come in.

455
00:24:25.964 --> 00:24:27.715
Oh, Jim, you're here.

456
00:24:27.799 --> 00:24:31.636
I was just walking by
your room and...

457
00:24:31.719 --> 00:24:33.804
And, you know,
I was thinking,

458
00:24:33.888 --> 00:24:38.225
"Boy, it's been a long time since
we've had a little father-son chat."

459
00:24:39.644 --> 00:24:43.731
Oh! I almost forgot.
I... I bought some magazines.

460
00:24:44.774 --> 00:24:47.777
Do you want to just flip
to the center section?

461
00:24:49.278 --> 00:24:51.989
Well, this is the...
This is the female form.

462
00:24:52.073 --> 00:24:55.076
And they have
focused on the breasts

463
00:24:55.159 --> 00:24:59.659
which are used primarily
to feed young infants

464
00:24:59.747 --> 00:25:03.083
and also in foreplay.

465
00:25:03.167 --> 00:25:04.293
Right.

466
00:25:04.377 --> 00:25:07.838
This is...
This is Hustler.

467
00:25:07.922 --> 00:25:11.592
And this is a much more
exotic magazine.

468
00:25:11.676 --> 00:25:16.176
Now, they have decided to
focus more on the pubic region...

469
00:25:16.556 --> 00:25:20.351
Right. Uh-huh.
...the whole groin area.

470
00:25:20.518 --> 00:25:22.520
Look at the expression
on her face.

471
00:25:22.603 --> 00:25:24.271
You see that?
See what she's doing?

472
00:25:24.689 --> 00:25:27.942
She's kind of looking
right into your eyes saying,

473
00:25:28.026 --> 00:25:31.320
"Hey, big boy.
Hey, how you doing?"

474
00:25:31.863 --> 00:25:33.447
You see?
Right.

475
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:39.453
Shaved is a magazine
I'm not too familiar with,

476
00:25:39.537 --> 00:25:42.331
but, again,
if you flip to the center

477
00:25:44.292 --> 00:25:46.335
section...

478
00:25:46.419 --> 00:25:50.214
Well, you see the detail that,
that they go into in this picture here.

479
00:25:50.298 --> 00:25:51.382
Yeah.

480
00:25:51.466 --> 00:25:54.427
It almost looks like
a tropical plant or some

481
00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:56.345
underwater thing.
Yeah. Yes.

482
00:25:56.471 --> 00:25:58.347
Do you know what a
clitoris is? Oh, my God.

483
00:25:58.473 --> 00:26:00.516
Well, don't say, "Oh..."
Yes, I know what a clitoris is.

484
00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.892
Oh, you do. Oh, I see.
Yes, you do.

485
00:26:01.976 --> 00:26:04.103
I forgot, you've been there
and back. You know everything.

486
00:26:04.187 --> 00:26:05.354
I've learned about it
in Sex Ed.

487
00:26:05.438 --> 00:26:06.897
I really don't need you
to talk about clitoris.

488
00:26:06.981 --> 00:26:08.107
I'm trying to
make this painless...

489
00:26:08.191 --> 00:26:10.359
You know what? I'm sorry.
Okay? I'm sorry.

490
00:26:10.443 --> 00:26:11.444
<i>No, no, no.</i>

491
00:26:11.527 --> 00:26:14.780
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

492
00:26:14.864 --> 00:26:16.240
I shouldn't have
got hot there.

493
00:26:16.324 --> 00:26:18.242
Well, you know what
I'm going to do, Jim.

494
00:26:18.326 --> 00:26:20.745
I'm going to just
leave these books here

495
00:26:20.828 --> 00:26:24.456
for you to peruse at your...
At your leisure.

496
00:26:25.416 --> 00:26:26.542
Wait!

497
00:26:32.632 --> 00:26:34.342
Well, safer than a tube sock.

498
00:26:36.969 --> 00:26:39.471
Okay, that... That
was good. Yeah.

499
00:26:42.475 --> 00:26:44.018
See you at dinner.

500
00:26:44.102 --> 00:26:45.812
Yeah. I'll see you at dinner.

501
00:26:46.813 --> 00:26:48.940
So, Finch,
this is your plan?

502
00:26:49.023 --> 00:26:52.151
You know, I don't think girls
are into the whole mini-golf thing.

503
00:26:52.235 --> 00:26:54.487
Kevin, I'm sure
that they're not.

504
00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:58.073
Actually, there is one small matter
that I need to ask for your cooperation in.

505
00:26:58.157 --> 00:26:59.700
In the spirit of this
whole pact, you know?

506
00:26:59.784 --> 00:27:00.910
Sure, what do you need?

507
00:27:00.993 --> 00:27:02.828
Whatever you hear about me,
you agree.

508
00:27:02.912 --> 00:27:04.788
And tell all the boys
the same thing.

509
00:27:04.872 --> 00:27:08.625
Look, I gotta go.
16 minutes round-trip.

510
00:27:08.709 --> 00:27:11.169
You know, Finch, it's,
it's senior year.

511
00:27:11.254 --> 00:27:14.298
I mean, don't you think it's time you
learned how to take a dump at school?

512
00:27:14.382 --> 00:27:17.093
When was the last time you
looked at the facilities in this school?

513
00:27:25.017 --> 00:27:26.810
Excuse me.

514
00:27:26.894 --> 00:27:28.478
That's Paul Finch, right?

515
00:27:28.563 --> 00:27:29.647
Yeah.

516
00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:32.649
Well, you've seen him
in the locker room, right?

517
00:27:32.733 --> 00:27:33.817
Yeah.

518
00:27:33.901 --> 00:27:37.237
So, my friends, they
want to know. Is it true?

519
00:27:37.321 --> 00:27:40.198
You know,
that he's equipped.

520
00:27:40.283 --> 00:27:43.494
I have no idea. Finch
showers with his bathing suit on.

521
00:27:43.578 --> 00:27:45.121
I mean...

522
00:27:46.205 --> 00:27:49.791
As a matter of fact, it
is true. The guy's huge!

523
00:27:49.876 --> 00:27:51.335
Does he have a date
for the prom yet?

524
00:27:51.419 --> 00:27:53.170
No, definitely not.

525
00:27:53.254 --> 00:27:54.964
All right. Thanks.

526
00:27:56.132 --> 00:27:57.258
Oh, man!

527
00:27:59.177 --> 00:28:03.677
So I was thinking maybe you could
give me some advice, brother to brother.

528
00:28:04.432 --> 00:28:07.476
<i>I thought you might know
a trick or something to make her...</i>

529
00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.770
Orgasm?
Yeah.

530
00:28:10.438 --> 00:28:11.856
What's good here?

531
00:28:11.939 --> 00:28:13.565
Try the spicy tuna
hand roll. <i>What?</i>

532
00:28:14.108 --> 00:28:17.444
How do you do that? Hey, never
mind that. Listen, pay attention.

533
00:28:17.528 --> 00:28:20.489
Is that all that you're interested
in, trying to get your girl into bed?

534
00:28:20.573 --> 00:28:24.118
No, it'd be good to be able
to, you know, return the favor.

535
00:28:24.202 --> 00:28:26.704
<i>Be nice to know she enjoys
things as much as I do.</i>

536
00:28:26.787 --> 00:28:29.956
See that? That's good. That's what
I wanted to hear. Now, you qualify.

537
00:28:30.416 --> 00:28:31.625
Qualify for what?

538
00:28:31.709 --> 00:28:33.627
My man, you've just
inherited the Bible.

539
00:28:37.215 --> 00:28:39.675
<i>It originally started
as a sex manual,</i>

540
00:28:39.759 --> 00:28:42.428
<i>this book that some guys
brought back from Amsterdam.</i>

541
00:28:42.511 --> 00:28:45.889
<i>And each year it got passed on to
one East student who was worthy.</i>

542
00:28:45.973 --> 00:28:50.394
<i>Now, it's full of all sorts of stuff
that guys have added over the years.</i>

543
00:28:52.396 --> 00:28:56.608
<i>But you have to keep it a secret
and return it at the end of the year.</i>

544
00:28:56.692 --> 00:28:59.569
<i>All right.
So now you know. Good luck.</i>

545
00:29:07.912 --> 00:29:10.122
<i>If you
believe in magic Magic</i>

546
00:29:10.206 --> 00:29:14.706
<i>Don't you bother to choose if it's
jug band music or rhythm and blues</i>

547
00:29:15.294 --> 00:29:18.755
<i>Just go and listen
It will start with a smile</i>

548
00:29:18.839 --> 00:29:22.592
<i>That won't wipe off your face
no matter how hard you try</i>

549
00:29:22.677 --> 00:29:27.177
<i>Your feet start tapping and you
can't seem to find, how you got there</i>

550
00:29:28.182 --> 00:29:30.893
<i>Do you believe in magic?</i>

551
00:29:30.977 --> 00:29:35.477
<i>Scooby-dooby doo bah
Scoo-Scooby-dooby Dooby-dooby doo bah</i>

552
00:29:35.731 --> 00:29:37.858
<i>Yeah, magic</i>

553
00:29:38.526 --> 00:29:40.069
What was that?

554
00:29:41.362 --> 00:29:43.364
Sorry.
No, it was good.

555
00:29:46.033 --> 00:29:49.286
Well, it, uh...
It came from the heart.

556
00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:52.956
Well, keep it coming.
All right, people, good work!

557
00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.959
Now, don't forget. The state
competition's a couple of weeks away

558
00:29:56.043 --> 00:29:58.211
so keep on it, okay?

559
00:30:09.557 --> 00:30:11.100
Not bad, Chris.

560
00:30:12.268 --> 00:30:13.519
Really?

561
00:30:15.229 --> 00:30:18.232
Yeah.
Thanks, Heather, right?

562
00:30:19.108 --> 00:30:22.444
So, you've got this sort of
Frank Sinatra thing going on.

563
00:30:22.528 --> 00:30:26.698
Right. I feel like I've discovered
this whole new side of me.

564
00:30:26.782 --> 00:30:29.409
I mean,
music is so expressive.

565
00:30:30.453 --> 00:30:33.038
Okay. I mean, I agree, but,

566
00:30:33.122 --> 00:30:36.166
aren't you supposed to be out,
like, trying to decapitate someone

567
00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:37.834
with your lacrosse stick
or something?

568
00:30:37.918 --> 00:30:40.462
Oh, sure. Sure.

569
00:30:40.546 --> 00:30:42.673
You know, I know what
people think. It's like,

570
00:30:42.757 --> 00:30:45.509
"Oz, he's just this
kick-ass lacrosse player."

571
00:30:45.593 --> 00:30:48.387
You know, I also play football,
by the way, but that's, like,

572
00:30:48.471 --> 00:30:50.139
that's not all that I am,
you know?

573
00:30:50.222 --> 00:30:51.348
Of course, I didn't...

574
00:30:51.432 --> 00:30:55.932
I mean, it really bothers me when
people try to pigeonhole me like that.

575
00:30:56.479 --> 00:30:57.605
You?

576
00:30:58.773 --> 00:31:00.775
You think
I don't get that?

577
00:31:00.858 --> 00:31:04.820
God, it's like just because I don't
get drunk and barf every weekend

578
00:31:04.904 --> 00:31:09.404
that people say, "Oh, look. There's
this goody two-shoes choir girl pries."

579
00:31:09.575 --> 00:31:12.786
Yeah. So, like,
what else do you do?

580
00:31:13.788 --> 00:31:17.124
Well, the same things you do,

581
00:31:17.208 --> 00:31:19.543
like hang out with friends
and stuff.

582
00:31:19.627 --> 00:31:20.711
Why? What do you think I do?

583
00:31:20.795 --> 00:31:22.004
Oh, I...

584
00:31:22.088 --> 00:31:25.132
I just realized that I don't
know anything about you.

585
00:31:25.216 --> 00:31:26.550
I was interested.

586
00:31:26.634 --> 00:31:30.179
Oh, well,
what do you want to know?

587
00:31:30.262 --> 00:31:33.139
You know, stuff, about you.

588
00:31:35.976 --> 00:31:37.352
All right.

589
00:31:39.939 --> 00:31:42.274
Mom, I'm home!

590
00:32:39.874 --> 00:32:42.167
Oh, yeah. Oh!

591
00:32:46.964 --> 00:32:50.592
Jim!
It's not what it looks like.

592
00:32:55.639 --> 00:32:59.851
Well, we'll just tell your
mother that, that we ate it all.

593
00:33:40.726 --> 00:33:43.437
<i>Goal by
number eight, Chris Ostreicher.</i>

594
00:33:46.815 --> 00:33:49.275
Nice game.
Nice game. Good game.

595
00:33:52.738 --> 00:33:55.490
Hey, what are you
doing here?

596
00:33:55.574 --> 00:33:59.119
Just enjoying my first
exhilarating lacrosse experience.

597
00:33:59.203 --> 00:34:01.788
You kicked butt.
Oh, thanks.

598
00:34:02.456 --> 00:34:05.125
Chris... Oh, you can
call me Oz, if you want.

599
00:34:05.209 --> 00:34:07.127
Do I have to?
You can call me Ostreicher.

600
00:34:07.211 --> 00:34:08.378
What's your middle name?

601
00:34:08.462 --> 00:34:09.629
No, forget it.

602
00:34:09.713 --> 00:34:11.131
Come on.
I won't tell anyone.

603
00:34:11.215 --> 00:34:13.133
Well, neither will I.

604
00:34:13.801 --> 00:34:14.968
Okay.

605
00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:20.474
So, I had this thought, and

606
00:34:20.558 --> 00:34:22.810
it may seem like
it's way out of left field.

607
00:34:22.893 --> 00:34:24.269
I don't know if you can,

608
00:34:24.353 --> 00:34:27.647
but since I'm not going with
anybody, I thought that maybe...

609
00:34:27.731 --> 00:34:30.358
Those guys sucked ass!

610
00:34:30.442 --> 00:34:33.278
Choir chick, what the
hell are you doing here?

611
00:34:33.362 --> 00:34:37.616
Well, I was
asking Chris to prom.

612
00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.410
So, do you want to go?

613
00:34:39.493 --> 00:34:42.829
Oh, yeah!
That would be great.

614
00:34:43.831 --> 00:34:46.333
Well, just don't expect Oz
to pay for the limo!

615
00:34:46.417 --> 00:34:49.294
Stifler, fuck! I mean...

616
00:34:50.462 --> 00:34:53.673
Why do you got to be
so insensitive all the time?

617
00:34:54.633 --> 00:34:55.759
What?

618
00:34:57.511 --> 00:35:00.805
Whatever. Look, don't forget.
My cottage after prom.

619
00:35:00.889 --> 00:35:02.557
On Lake Michigan.

620
00:35:04.351 --> 00:35:06.728
Hey, wait up, you pussies.
Where you going?

621
00:35:08.522 --> 00:35:10.857
Well, I gotta...
I gotta hit the showers now

622
00:35:10.941 --> 00:35:14.694
but I think this is gonna
be really, really good.

623
00:35:14.778 --> 00:35:17.280
Yeah. Me too.

624
00:35:17.364 --> 00:35:18.448
All right.

625
00:35:18.532 --> 00:35:20.700
Bye. Bye.
Bye.

626
00:35:26.707 --> 00:35:30.627
'Appening Oz!
Working with the choir chick?

627
00:35:30.711 --> 00:35:34.506
What do you say, fellas? I just dig
those cute little sweaters she wears.

628
00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:37.050
Nuts you do,
you little horn dog.

629
00:35:38.385 --> 00:35:41.388
Yeah! Yeah, baby!

630
00:35:41.472 --> 00:35:45.392
Spank me! Spank me!
Hit that high C.

631
00:35:51.482 --> 00:35:53.692
Come on!
What's going on here?

632
00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:00.699
I was being selfish
and majorly insensitive.

633
00:36:00.783 --> 00:36:03.535
I'm a... I'm a total idiot.
I mean, a fool, a buffoon.

634
00:36:03.619 --> 00:36:05.996
I think shithead
really says it.

635
00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.874
You know what? You're
right. I'm a shithead,

636
00:36:08.957 --> 00:36:10.833
and I want to
make it up to you.

637
00:36:10.918 --> 00:36:12.920
Oh, yeah? How?

638
00:36:15.381 --> 00:36:16.924
<i>Oh, make me over</i>

639
00:36:17.007 --> 00:36:19.509
Vicky.
Your parents are downstairs.

640
00:36:19.593 --> 00:36:21.136
Kevin, don't stop!

641
00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:22.512
Just a second.

642
00:36:22.763 --> 00:36:25.682
<i>A walking study</i>

643
00:36:25.766 --> 00:36:28.310
<i>In demonology</i>

644
00:36:28.394 --> 00:36:31.355
<i>Hey, so glad
you could make it</i>

645
00:36:31.438 --> 00:36:33.148
<i>Yeah, now you really made it</i>

646
00:36:34.316 --> 00:36:37.527
Hon, can you tell Vic
to come on down for supper?

647
00:36:38.612 --> 00:36:40.196
Holy shit!

648
00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:43.199
You know there's
no lock on your door?

649
00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:53.168
Oh! I'm coming! I'm coming!

650
00:36:57.256 --> 00:36:58.757
Oh, Jim!
Dad.

651
00:36:58.841 --> 00:37:02.219
Hi, I was just looking at the
old family portrait out here.

652
00:37:03.303 --> 00:37:05.388
Well, that was a fun day,
wasn't it?

653
00:37:05.472 --> 00:37:08.224
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.

654
00:37:08.308 --> 00:37:11.728
Jim, I want to
talk about masturbation.

655
00:37:11.812 --> 00:37:16.312
Now, I just want you to know
that it's, it's a perfectly normal thing.

656
00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:18.568
And I have to admit,
you know,

657
00:37:18.652 --> 00:37:23.152
I did a fair bit of masturbating
when I was a little younger.

658
00:37:23.282 --> 00:37:27.077
I, I used to call it
"stroking the salami."

659
00:37:27.161 --> 00:37:30.581
Yeah, you know,
"pounding the ol' pud."

660
00:37:30.664 --> 00:37:33.541
I never did it
with baked goods.

661
00:37:33.625 --> 00:37:34.834
But you know
your Uncle Mort?

662
00:37:34.918 --> 00:37:37.503
He "pinched the one-eyed
snake" five, six times a day.

663
00:37:37.588 --> 00:37:41.675
See, it's like,
practice for the big game.

664
00:37:41.759 --> 00:37:45.137
You see?
It's like... It's like,

665
00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:48.348
banging a tennis ball
against a brick wall.

666
00:37:48.432 --> 00:37:52.436
Which can be fun. It can
be fun, but it's not a game.

667
00:37:52.519 --> 00:37:54.896
Right. No.
It's not a game.

668
00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:58.316
What you want is you want
a partner to return the ball.

669
00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.193
Do you want a partner?

670
00:38:00.277 --> 00:38:02.153
Yeah. Yeah,
yeah, I want a partner.

671
00:38:02.237 --> 00:38:04.072
You do want a partner?
Oh, I want a partner.

672
00:38:04.198 --> 00:38:06.950
You want a partner.
Good. Good. Of course.

673
00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:09.786
Good.

674
00:38:11.038 --> 00:38:13.790
So, once Hal
becomes king, he has to take on

675
00:38:13.874 --> 00:38:16.793
the responsibilities of
leadership and turn his back

676
00:38:16.877 --> 00:38:19.629
on his old,
drunken friend, Falstaff.

677
00:38:19.713 --> 00:38:24.008
You see, Hal is going through a
rite of passage, much like you all are.

678
00:38:24.092 --> 00:38:28.471
So make most of the time you've
got left together. You'll miss it later.

679
00:38:28.847 --> 00:38:30.974
So, does your tongue
cramp up?

680
00:38:31.058 --> 00:38:33.602
No. You get kind of
dizzy, though.

681
00:38:33.685 --> 00:38:34.769
Wow.

682
00:38:34.853 --> 00:38:38.398
That's amazing. She's probably
gonna want to do it soon.

683
00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.987
All right.
Class dismissed.

684
00:38:46.824 --> 00:38:50.327
Still questing after
the Holy Grail, huh, guys?

685
00:38:54.998 --> 00:38:56.791
Hey, where's Finch?

686
00:38:56.875 --> 00:38:59.460
Oh, he went home
to take a shit.

687
00:38:59.545 --> 00:39:00.879
I don't get it.
I just don't.

688
00:39:00.963 --> 00:39:03.715
How does a guy like that
get this sudden reputation?

689
00:39:03.799 --> 00:39:05.217
What reputation?

690
00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:06.551
Observe.

691
00:39:07.344 --> 00:39:11.598
Excuse me. Do you
know who Paul Finch is?

692
00:39:11.682 --> 00:39:15.435
Yeah! He's the guy
with the tattoo, right?

693
00:39:15.519 --> 00:39:18.688
You know, the eagle and the
blazing fire and all that stuff.

694
00:39:20.148 --> 00:39:24.318
Well, if you guys see him later,
will you tell him Courtney says hi?

695
00:39:24.403 --> 00:39:25.487
Bye.

696
00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.659
Okay. Explain.

697
00:39:30.742 --> 00:39:31.868
I can't.

698
00:39:31.952 --> 00:39:33.912
I don't know how
he's doing it.

699
00:39:34.955 --> 00:39:37.332
I guess that
just leaves Jim trailing.

700
00:39:37.416 --> 00:39:39.876
Jimbo!
Better sack up, buddy!

701
00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.212
Yeah, I know.
I'm working on it, all right?

702
00:39:42.296 --> 00:39:43.588
James?

703
00:39:43.672 --> 00:39:46.883
You are very good in the
world history class, yes?

704
00:39:46.967 --> 00:39:49.761
Me? Yes. No...

705
00:39:49.845 --> 00:39:51.054
Yes, I am.

706
00:39:51.138 --> 00:39:53.598
Perhaps you could
help me with my studies.

707
00:39:54.641 --> 00:39:55.725
Yeah. Absolutely.

708
00:39:55.809 --> 00:39:58.019
That would
be... That would be great sometime.

709
00:39:58.103 --> 00:39:59.646
How about tomorrow?

710
00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:02.733
Well, I have
ballet practice.

711
00:40:02.816 --> 00:40:06.069
Perhaps, I could come
by your house afterwards?

712
00:40:06.153 --> 00:40:08.155
I could change clothes
at your place.

713
00:40:11.158 --> 00:40:13.827
Oh. Yeah.

714
00:40:13.911 --> 00:40:16.455
I suppose
that would be okay. Sure.

715
00:40:25.839 --> 00:40:27.131
Nice car!

716
00:40:28.216 --> 00:40:29.383
I'm glad you think so.

717
00:40:29.468 --> 00:40:30.760
You don't like it?

718
00:40:30.844 --> 00:40:34.138
No, I like the car. By the
way, though, about prom?

719
00:40:34.222 --> 00:40:37.433
That was a bad idea.
I'm sorry I invited you.

720
00:40:37.517 --> 00:40:38.893
What are you
talking about?

721
00:40:38.977 --> 00:40:40.436
Please.

722
00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:43.981
I asked you because I thought you
might actually be worth going with.

723
00:40:44.066 --> 00:40:47.277
But you are just a jock.
No, wait. You're a jerk.

724
00:40:48.487 --> 00:40:50.947
Wait! I don't understand.

725
00:40:51.031 --> 00:40:54.617
I saw you making fun of me
with your lacrosse buddies.

726
00:40:54.701 --> 00:40:56.035
Heather, I wasn't
making fun of you.

727
00:40:56.119 --> 00:40:58.704
Give me a break.
You're so full of it.

728
00:41:02.042 --> 00:41:03.585
Fuck me!

729
00:41:03.669 --> 00:41:07.422
There's gonna be an Eastern
European chick naked in your house.

730
00:41:07.506 --> 00:41:09.883
And you're not gonna
do anything about that?

731
00:41:09.967 --> 00:41:13.095
What am I gonna do, huh?
Broadcast her over the Internet?

732
00:41:14.012 --> 00:41:16.597
Yeah.
You can do that?

733
00:41:22.062 --> 00:41:24.189
No. I cannot
do that to her.

734
00:41:24.815 --> 00:41:27.734
Jim, get some
fucking balls.

735
00:41:28.235 --> 00:41:30.654
If you don't have the guts
to photograph a naked chick,

736
00:41:30.737 --> 00:41:32.572
how you gonna
sleep with one?

737
00:41:33.198 --> 00:41:35.366
I don't like the kid,
but he's got a point.

738
00:41:35.909 --> 00:41:39.162
See, even shit-brick
knows you should do it.

739
00:41:39.246 --> 00:41:42.958
All you gotta do is set up some sort
of private link or whatever on the net

740
00:41:43.041 --> 00:41:44.417
and tell me the address.

741
00:41:44.835 --> 00:41:47.546
You can send me
the address too.

742
00:41:47.629 --> 00:41:49.464
I'll save you a seat.

743
00:41:50.882 --> 00:41:55.382
<i>How sweet
it is to be loved by you, by you</i>

744
00:41:56.054 --> 00:41:59.098
<i>I needed the shelter
of someone's arms</i>

745
00:41:59.182 --> 00:42:00.641
<i>Someone's arms</i>

746
00:42:00.726 --> 00:42:02.519
There you were

747
00:42:02.602 --> 00:42:04.353
<i>You were, oh</i>

748
00:42:04.438 --> 00:42:08.938
<i>I needed someone to
understand my ups and downs</i>

749
00:42:09.234 --> 00:42:11.361
There you were

750
00:42:11.445 --> 00:42:14.906
Okay, that was good, but I
want to thicken up that solo.

751
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:18.493
Michigan State is this Saturday,
and I want that part to smoke.

752
00:42:18.577 --> 00:42:19.828
Yeah, I know,
my timing's off.

753
00:42:19.911 --> 00:42:24.081
No, it's not that. I think it'll work
better as a duet with a tenor part.

754
00:42:24.166 --> 00:42:25.584
I'll do it.

755
00:42:27.627 --> 00:42:28.753
Dick.

756
00:42:29.421 --> 00:42:32.132
I'll do it.
Great. See you tomorrow.

757
00:42:39.222 --> 00:42:40.973
Why are you doing this?

758
00:42:41.058 --> 00:42:42.142
'Cause I want to.

759
00:42:42.225 --> 00:42:46.562
Yeah? Well, you can't
fake this. You better practice.

760
00:43:00.535 --> 00:43:01.827
Come in.

761
00:43:03.038 --> 00:43:07.538
Jim? There's a, a young
lady here to see you.

762
00:43:07.918 --> 00:43:09.920
Hey, Nadia.
Hi, James. Ready to study?

763
00:43:10.003 --> 00:43:12.755
Oh, he's always ready to study.
He's a real bookworm, this kid.

764
00:43:12.839 --> 00:43:14.090
Dad.
I mean,

765
00:43:14.174 --> 00:43:16.217
he's not, not one of those
nerdy guys but...

766
00:43:16.301 --> 00:43:17.593
Dad!

767
00:43:17.677 --> 00:43:21.013
Well, I'll, I'll let you two
hit the books.

768
00:43:25.435 --> 00:43:27.061
You want a beer?

769
00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.606
Oh, there we go.

770
00:43:30.148 --> 00:43:31.649
Come on, move!

771
00:43:32.609 --> 00:43:36.904
Steve! It's my computer!
And I wanna use it!

772
00:43:36.988 --> 00:43:38.239
Shut up!

773
00:43:38.698 --> 00:43:41.909
Oh, you need
to... You need to change, right?

774
00:43:41.993 --> 00:43:44.203
Do you mind?
No. No, not at all.

775
00:43:44.287 --> 00:43:48.124
Please, you know. Just go
ahead and get un... Get changed.

776
00:43:48.208 --> 00:43:51.294
I'll, I'll go downstairs
and start studying up.

777
00:43:51.378 --> 00:43:52.879
Yeah.
Okay.

778
00:43:53.713 --> 00:43:56.132
All right, there he goes.
Oh.

779
00:43:56.216 --> 00:43:58.134
Now we're in business.

780
00:44:00.679 --> 00:44:02.722
Back in a sec.
Jimmy, honey...

781
00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:19.155
<i>He pauses shaving and he
tells himself that he is the bomb</i>

782
00:44:19.239 --> 00:44:23.739
<i>She has her curlers set Her
credit cards are paying the funds</i>

783
00:44:23.827 --> 00:44:26.120
<i>He's not that old
I've been told</i>

784
00:44:26.204 --> 00:44:27.622
Here she is.

785
00:44:29.166 --> 00:44:30.667
Did I miss anything?

786
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:32.835
No. You are just in time.

787
00:44:32.919 --> 00:44:35.379
- Oh. Oh!
- This is incredible.

788
00:44:36.756 --> 00:44:39.008
Oh, my God!
This is too much.

789
00:44:39.092 --> 00:44:42.845
Oh, did you see?
Oh, there that goes. Oh, geez.

790
00:44:42.929 --> 00:44:45.014
God bless the Internet.

791
00:44:46.892 --> 00:44:49.019
- Do it. Take it off.
- Oh, my God.

792
00:44:49.102 --> 00:44:50.103
Oh!

793
00:44:50.187 --> 00:44:53.148
Oh, thank you, God, for
this wonderful, wonderful day.

794
00:44:53.231 --> 00:44:55.191
Man, she takes
her vitamins.

795
00:44:55.275 --> 00:44:57.986
<i>And it is way
too unhealthy</i>

796
00:44:58.069 --> 00:45:00.071
<i>Often they've typically</i>

797
00:45:00.155 --> 00:45:02.073
Stop hyperventilating.

798
00:45:06.953 --> 00:45:11.374
This is, like, the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

799
00:45:11.458 --> 00:45:12.750
I know.

800
00:45:14.628 --> 00:45:19.128
Can you believe... This is definitely
one of Stifler's best ideas ever.

801
00:45:19.466 --> 00:45:20.967
What is she...
She's touching my stuff.

802
00:45:21.092 --> 00:45:23.427
- Why is she touching my stuff?
- Man, let her touch.

803
00:45:23.553 --> 00:45:26.806
She's going through my stuff!
Nadia can touch anything she wants.

804
00:45:34.231 --> 00:45:36.441
Oh.
Oh, no. Oh, no.

805
00:45:36.566 --> 00:45:39.026
No, no. Oh, nice
collection there, Jim.

806
00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:41.987
She's gonna leave.
She's definitely gonna...

807
00:45:42.072 --> 00:45:44.699
She's getting comfortable.
She's not gonna leave.

808
00:45:44.783 --> 00:45:46.701
She reads the articles.

809
00:46:00.173 --> 00:46:01.340
Is she?

810
00:46:02.801 --> 00:46:04.636
She's going downstairs.

811
00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:13.770
Oh, my God!
JACKPOT, baby!

812
00:46:13.853 --> 00:46:15.187
Can you believe this?

813
00:46:15.272 --> 00:46:16.898
I have an announcement
that I would like to make.

814
00:46:16.982 --> 00:46:21.482
There is a gorgeous woman
masturbating on my bed!

815
00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:23.821
Thank you, Nadia!

816
00:46:23.905 --> 00:46:27.658
If you ever had a chance
with Nadia, this is it.

817
00:46:28.952 --> 00:46:30.244
What am I supposed
to do, Kev?

818
00:46:30.745 --> 00:46:31.871
Seduce her.

819
00:46:34.207 --> 00:46:35.875
What the hell
would I say?

820
00:46:35.959 --> 00:46:39.170
Go over there and ask her
if she needs an extra hand.

821
00:46:39.254 --> 00:46:40.255
That's stupid, Kev.
I can't...

822
00:46:40.338 --> 00:46:42.965
That's not stupid! You're
stupid if you don't go!

823
00:46:43.049 --> 00:46:44.967
Come on!
Get over there!

824
00:46:45.051 --> 00:46:46.385
Get going, man.
She's prime.

825
00:46:46.469 --> 00:46:47.553
Get out of here!

826
00:46:47.637 --> 00:46:51.015
She's waiting for you.
Okay, all right. I'm going.

827
00:46:51.099 --> 00:46:52.308
Go! Go!
I'm going!

828
00:46:52.392 --> 00:46:54.394
Go!Go!Go!Go!
Oh, shit.

829
00:47:03.653 --> 00:47:07.323
<i>She's open
waiting for more</i>

830
00:47:07.407 --> 00:47:11.907
<i>And I know he's only
looking to score</i>

831
00:47:12.037 --> 00:47:15.206
<i>And it's way too unhealthy
Often they've typically</i>

832
00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:16.582
Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.

833
00:47:16.666 --> 00:47:20.002
<i>Been starved
for attention before</i>

834
00:47:23.089 --> 00:47:25.549
Oh, boy. Oh, God.
Oh, crap. Oh, no.

835
00:47:28.345 --> 00:47:29.429
Hello?

836
00:47:29.512 --> 00:47:32.181
Looks like Jim addressed
the e-mail wrong.

837
00:47:32.265 --> 00:47:33.349
What?

838
00:47:33.433 --> 00:47:36.769
It went out to every mailbox
in the East High directory.

839
00:47:36.853 --> 00:47:38.354
God, how juvenile.

840
00:47:39.064 --> 00:47:40.565
Hey, hey, hey, guys!

841
00:47:40.648 --> 00:47:41.690
<i>Baby!</i>

842
00:47:41.775 --> 00:47:45.111
Check this out!
Oh, my God! Wow!

843
00:47:47.906 --> 00:47:48.948
Oh.

844
00:47:50.617 --> 00:47:54.704
Please, God,
let this be it.

845
00:47:54.788 --> 00:47:55.997
Please?

846
00:48:00.543 --> 00:48:01.877
Somebody's going in there.

847
00:48:06.966 --> 00:48:09.259
Here you go.
That's what you need to do.

848
00:48:09.344 --> 00:48:11.137
That guy's in my trig class.
Oh, no.

849
00:48:13.973 --> 00:48:15.975
Looks like you could
use an extra hand.

850
00:48:16.059 --> 00:48:17.226
Jim!

851
00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:19.854
Well... Oh, God.
Shame on you.

852
00:48:19.938 --> 00:48:22.565
Yeah, shame on me.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

853
00:48:22.649 --> 00:48:25.276
You know, I'm just gonna go.
Well,

854
00:48:26.736 --> 00:48:28.404
you have seen me.

855
00:48:29.489 --> 00:48:31.699
Now, it's my turn to see you.

856
00:48:33.618 --> 00:48:34.827
Strip!

857
00:48:36.663 --> 00:48:38.247
Strip?
Slowly.

858
00:48:40.834 --> 00:48:43.419
You mean, like,
strip, strip?

859
00:48:43.503 --> 00:48:44.712
For me.

860
00:48:46.923 --> 00:48:48.758
What is he talking
to her about?

861
00:48:48.842 --> 00:48:50.593
No idea.

862
00:48:50.677 --> 00:48:53.262
Come on, Jim. People
are viewing. Get to business.

863
00:48:56.850 --> 00:48:58.101
Perfect!

864
00:48:59.936 --> 00:49:02.563
Move, James! Move!
Yeah, yeah. Move.

865
00:49:10.947 --> 00:49:13.366
Go, trig boy!
It's your birthday!

866
00:49:24.419 --> 00:49:26.045
No! No. No.
Please, God.

867
00:49:27.547 --> 00:49:28.548
What's going on?

868
00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:36.513
Yes!
All right. Get in the mix!

869
00:49:36.598 --> 00:49:37.807
See there.
Oh, okay.

870
00:49:40.727 --> 00:49:42.103
This is disgusting.

871
00:49:43.062 --> 00:49:44.980
What the fuck is this?

872
00:49:47.525 --> 00:49:49.151
Cut it out, man!

873
00:49:54.657 --> 00:49:55.783
Yeah.

874
00:50:08.922 --> 00:50:10.089
Freak.

875
00:50:15.178 --> 00:50:17.096
He did not just
take out that chair.

876
00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:18.556
Yup, he took out the chair.

877
00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:20.850
More, more, you bad boy!

878
00:50:20.934 --> 00:50:24.729
Oh, yeah, I'm bad.
I'm naughty, baby. Yeah!

879
00:50:25.605 --> 00:50:27.481
Oh, God!

880
00:50:29.234 --> 00:50:31.819
<i>Calling your name</i>

881
00:50:31.903 --> 00:50:34.322
<i>Calling your name</i>

882
00:50:34.405 --> 00:50:36.907
Now, come to me.

883
00:50:36.991 --> 00:50:38.534
Oh, yeah.

884
00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:49.044
Here we go.
He's in, man.

885
00:50:49.462 --> 00:50:50.463
<i>Calling</i>

886
00:50:50.547 --> 00:50:51.756
This just got
a hell of a lot better.

887
00:50:51.839 --> 00:50:53.382
Be gentle.

888
00:50:53.466 --> 00:50:54.842
Okay.

889
00:50:56.803 --> 00:50:59.889
<i>Calling your name</i>

890
00:50:59.973 --> 00:51:02.642
<i>Calling your name</i>

891
00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:08.981
Oh!
Jim?

892
00:51:09.357 --> 00:51:10.858
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

893
00:51:10.942 --> 00:51:14.236
Oh. Oh!
You've done that before, dude.

894
00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:15.446
Houston,
we have a problem.

895
00:51:18.491 --> 00:51:20.784
What happened?
What did he do?

896
00:51:21.494 --> 00:51:22.620
He blew it.

897
00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:24.998
I guess I'll be going now.

898
00:51:25.081 --> 00:51:29.581
No, no, no, ' not done,
Nadia. I've got reserves.

899
00:51:30.837 --> 00:51:33.548
Nadia, please, please.
I'm begging you.

900
00:51:33.631 --> 00:51:36.592
Well, I do like
your dirty magazines.

901
00:51:36.676 --> 00:51:41.176
You do? Okay.
Well. Did, did you see this one?

902
00:51:42.056 --> 00:51:46.556
This here is your, is your
more exotic, risque magazine.

903
00:51:47.061 --> 00:51:49.229
He's pulling out the porn.
He's desperate.

904
00:51:49.314 --> 00:51:50.732
Jim, just wait
till she leaves.

905
00:51:51.024 --> 00:51:53.609
Very arousing women.
They arouse me...

906
00:51:53.693 --> 00:51:55.736
They arouse me
very, very much.

907
00:51:55.820 --> 00:52:00.157
But... But not as
arousing as you.

908
00:52:00.241 --> 00:52:03.619
Oh, Jim!
Oh, God!

909
00:52:08.207 --> 00:52:09.541
Yes!
Yes!

910
00:52:11.836 --> 00:52:13.587
He's ruining daisy!

911
00:52:17.008 --> 00:52:20.386
So, "shaved"
is the expression?

912
00:52:24.599 --> 00:52:25.891
Holy shit.

913
00:52:25.975 --> 00:52:27.393
Holy shit!

914
00:52:27.602 --> 00:52:29.020
Holy shit!

915
00:52:29.479 --> 00:52:30.605
Holy shit!

916
00:52:30.688 --> 00:52:32.272
Touch me, Jim.

917
00:52:34.942 --> 00:52:36.068
Here.

918
00:52:36.653 --> 00:52:38.613
Oh. Oh.

919
00:52:39.989 --> 00:52:40.990
Again?

920
00:52:41.074 --> 00:52:42.450
Not again.

921
00:52:42.575 --> 00:52:44.076
Not again, man!

922
00:52:44.535 --> 00:52:45.619
Is that possible?

923
00:52:46.245 --> 00:52:47.746
What a loser.

924
00:52:51.834 --> 00:52:52.918
Hey!

925
00:53:15.483 --> 00:53:19.945
<i>I needed someone
to understand my ups and downs</i>

926
00:53:20.029 --> 00:53:22.781
There you were

927
00:53:23.491 --> 00:53:27.286
<i>With sweet love
and devotion</i>

928
00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:30.039
<i>Deeply touching my emotion</i>

929
00:53:30.123 --> 00:53:34.623
<i>I just wanna stop
and thank you, baby</i>

930
00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:39.382
Hey, minute man!
Shut up.

931
00:53:39.465 --> 00:53:41.717
You know... You know you're
supposed to be supportive.

932
00:53:41.801 --> 00:53:44.970
Hey, you think you still
got a chance with Nadia?

933
00:53:46.305 --> 00:53:48.932
No. Her sponsors here
saw the thing on the net.

934
00:53:49.016 --> 00:53:51.351
I really don't think
they liked it.

935
00:53:51.436 --> 00:53:53.312
How do you know that?

936
00:53:53.438 --> 00:53:55.565
She's already on a plane
back home.

937
00:53:55.648 --> 00:53:56.815
Yeah.

938
00:53:57.608 --> 00:54:01.570
You know, guys? Maybe I'm
just not good with girls, period.

939
00:54:01.654 --> 00:54:04.990
No, no, no, really, really. Like, like I
was born without that part of the brain.

940
00:54:05.074 --> 00:54:07.076
I mean,
I can't talk to girls.

941
00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:08.953
And when I do talk to them,
I screw it up.

942
00:54:09.036 --> 00:54:12.664
Yeah, well, come prom, those
excuses aren't going to do you any good.

943
00:54:16.085 --> 00:54:20.005
And one time at band camp,
we weren't supposed to have pillow fights

944
00:54:20.089 --> 00:54:23.342
but we had a pillow fight,
and it was so much fun.

945
00:54:23.426 --> 00:54:27.926
And this one time, we all lost our music
and we were supposed to play this song,

946
00:54:28.473 --> 00:54:32.973
but we didn't know it, so we just made
it up and we kept playing and playing

947
00:54:33.895 --> 00:54:38.107
and the conductor didn't know what
we were doing, and it was so funny.

948
00:54:38.191 --> 00:54:40.568
So, you're pissed
about something, huh.

949
00:54:40.651 --> 00:54:42.152
You know what I do
when I'm angry?

950
00:54:42.236 --> 00:54:45.614
I just play some Bach on
my flute. It's so relaxing.

951
00:54:45.698 --> 00:54:47.116
I learned to do that
at band camp.

952
00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:49.202
Hold on.

953
00:54:49.285 --> 00:54:52.288
You have no idea
why I'm angry?

954
00:54:52.371 --> 00:54:54.206
Is it because we have
a test tomorrow?

955
00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:58.790
Sometimes I get cranky when I
know I have a big test to study for.

956
00:54:59.295 --> 00:55:01.964
Yeah.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

957
00:55:02.048 --> 00:55:04.800
I thought so because this
one time at band camp...

958
00:55:04.884 --> 00:55:06.385
What's your name?

959
00:55:06.469 --> 00:55:08.471
Michelle.
Okay. Michelle.

960
00:55:11.224 --> 00:55:13.517
Do you want to be
my date for the prom?

961
00:55:13.601 --> 00:55:16.437
Really? You seriously
want to go with me?

962
00:55:20.691 --> 00:55:22.651
Yes. Seriously.

963
00:55:22.735 --> 00:55:24.695
Are we going to Steve
Stifler's party afterwards?

964
00:55:24.779 --> 00:55:27.114
Because that
would be so cool.

965
00:55:27.198 --> 00:55:29.408
Sure, whatever you want.

966
00:55:29.492 --> 00:55:31.994
Cool! We're gonna have
such a good time.

967
00:55:32.078 --> 00:55:36.373
It'll be like this one time at band
camp when we all had a campfire...

968
00:55:51.848 --> 00:55:52.932
Hi.

969
00:55:54.809 --> 00:55:56.352
How'd you know I was here?

970
00:55:56.435 --> 00:55:57.769
Stifler told me.

971
00:55:58.938 --> 00:56:00.314
Talked to Stifler?

972
00:56:00.398 --> 00:56:02.525
Well, I needed to find you.

973
00:56:02.608 --> 00:56:05.694
We're gonna have to
work on that song.

974
00:56:05.778 --> 00:56:09.072
Okay. I'm glad you came by.

975
00:56:09.156 --> 00:56:10.907
So you work nights?

976
00:56:13.202 --> 00:56:14.411
My dad's the manager.

977
00:56:14.495 --> 00:56:16.121
Really?

978
00:56:16.205 --> 00:56:19.082
Cool. Tell him
the subs are great.

979
00:56:21.711 --> 00:56:23.212
So you're going
to Michigan next year?

980
00:56:23.296 --> 00:56:24.297
Yeah.

981
00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:27.132
My parents want me to go
to Northwestern, but...

982
00:56:27.216 --> 00:56:30.469
I don't wanna write all those
extra essays they make you do.

983
00:56:30.553 --> 00:56:31.720
I mean, how am I
supposed to know

984
00:56:31.804 --> 00:56:35.432
what my "most emotionally
significant moment" was?

985
00:56:35.516 --> 00:56:40.016
So when my U of M acceptance came
in December, I just said the hell with it.

986
00:56:40.688 --> 00:56:42.314
Onions?
What?

987
00:56:43.316 --> 00:56:45.276
You want onions?

988
00:56:45.359 --> 00:56:46.985
Oh, no, thank you.

989
00:56:49.739 --> 00:56:52.074
So what are you
gonna major in?

990
00:56:52.158 --> 00:56:54.410
State's got a good
business school,

991
00:56:54.493 --> 00:56:57.162
and I could probably walk
onto the lacrosse team.

992
00:56:57.246 --> 00:56:59.998
Well, you've probably got it
pretty figured out, then, huh?

993
00:57:00.082 --> 00:57:04.294
I mean, business is okay,
and lacrosse is awesome, but,

994
00:57:04.378 --> 00:57:07.422
what am I gonna be, a
professional lacrosse player?

995
00:57:07.506 --> 00:57:09.382
I really have no idea.

996
00:57:09.467 --> 00:57:12.344
Thank God. I thought
I was the only one.

997
00:57:13.346 --> 00:57:14.680
Well, you're not.

998
00:57:16.349 --> 00:57:18.184
So we're gonna be
close next year.

999
00:57:26.609 --> 00:57:28.485
You mean East Lansing
and Ann Arbor?

1000
00:57:28.569 --> 00:57:29.820
Yeah.

1001
00:57:31.864 --> 00:57:32.990
What are you
talking about?

1002
00:57:33.074 --> 00:57:35.618
I'm sorry, but I can't
go to the prom with you.

1003
00:57:35.701 --> 00:57:37.536
I'm holding out
for someone else.

1004
00:57:38.496 --> 00:57:40.706
You gotta be fucking
kidding me.

1005
00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:44.335
I know it's a long shot, but I
figure Paul Finch might ask me.

1006
00:57:45.086 --> 00:57:47.838
Finch. Shit-brick.

1007
00:57:48.881 --> 00:57:51.508
Oh, gosh. I forgot.

1008
00:57:51.592 --> 00:57:53.844
You look okay.

1009
00:57:53.928 --> 00:57:56.597
I mean, the scars
healed really well.

1010
00:57:57.515 --> 00:57:59.517
Hey, Stifler.
Eat shit.

1011
00:58:02.269 --> 00:58:04.104
What was that all about?

1012
00:58:04.188 --> 00:58:06.773
He's still embarrassed
because Finch kicked his ass.

1013
00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:08.526
Who told you that?

1014
00:58:09.235 --> 00:58:10.945
What do you mean,
"no comment"?

1015
00:58:11.028 --> 00:58:12.320
Did you two hook up
or something?

1016
00:58:12.405 --> 00:58:14.198
What, are you kidding? No.

1017
00:58:14.281 --> 00:58:17.575
Then how did all this
get started?

1018
00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:20.996
Well, I guess it's all right
for me to tell you now.

1019
00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:25.167
That reputation of his isn't
going anywhere. Cheese, please.

1020
00:58:25.251 --> 00:58:27.253
Finch comes up to me
and says, "Jessica,

1021
00:58:27.336 --> 00:58:29.921
"I need your help with this,
blah, blah, etcetera."

1022
00:58:30.006 --> 00:58:32.633
So I said, "All right.
Pay me 200 bucks,

1023
00:58:32.717 --> 00:58:35.511
"and I'll tell a couple of girls
that you're dynamite in bed."

1024
00:58:35.594 --> 00:58:37.721
So he did, and I did.

1025
00:58:37.805 --> 00:58:39.014
That actually works?

1026
00:58:39.098 --> 00:58:40.349
Well, duh! Of course.

1027
00:58:40.433 --> 00:58:43.018
Naturally, I embellished
a little bit.

1028
00:58:43.102 --> 00:58:45.395
Did you hear that Finch had
an affair with an older woman?

1029
00:58:45.479 --> 00:58:47.606
No, I didn't hear that one.

1030
00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:49.775
That one was my favorite.

1031
00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:52.527
Dude, that cheerleader.

1032
00:58:52.611 --> 00:58:53.778
<i>Thank</i> you, <i>baby</i>

1033
00:58:53.863 --> 00:58:55.698
She wants me.
She calls me up...

1034
00:58:55.781 --> 00:59:00.281
<i>How sweet it is
to be loved by you</i>

1035
00:59:00.411 --> 00:59:03.372
Oh, my God, you're gay!

1036
00:59:03.456 --> 00:59:05.708
Sing it with me.
You know the words.

1037
00:59:05.791 --> 00:59:08.877
No thanks, man. You've
been singing that shit all week.

1038
00:59:08.961 --> 00:59:12.714
If you try that at MSU this
Saturday, I'll kick your ass.

1039
00:59:12.798 --> 00:59:14.591
Our last game
is this Saturday.

1040
00:59:15.718 --> 00:59:16.802
Yeah, well, shit.

1041
00:59:20.389 --> 00:59:24.017
I've got this lacrosse game. It's
really important. It's our last game.

1042
00:59:24.101 --> 00:59:27.646
Central almost beat us last time, so
this time I really wanna kick their ass.

1043
00:59:27.730 --> 00:59:30.524
But it's gonna be cool,
because the game's at State

1044
00:59:30.608 --> 00:59:32.901
which means afterwards
I'll be able to stop by.

1045
00:59:32.985 --> 00:59:35.070
So you can't sing
at the competition.

1046
00:59:36.322 --> 00:59:38.115
Heather, I'm sorry.
I totally blew it.

1047
00:59:38.199 --> 00:59:39.491
It's okay.

1048
00:59:39.575 --> 00:59:42.119
You should do
what makes you happy.

1049
00:59:44.455 --> 00:59:48.083
All right. Listen, thanks
for understanding.

1050
00:59:48.167 --> 00:59:49.293
Yeah.

1051
00:59:51.504 --> 00:59:53.839
So,I guess
I'll see you later?

1052
01:00:10.064 --> 01:00:11.857
Hey, Kevin.

1053
01:00:11.941 --> 01:00:13.442
You seen shit-brick lately?

1054
01:00:14.026 --> 01:00:16.945
Why? What did you do to him?

1055
01:00:17.029 --> 01:00:18.697
Me? Nothing.

1056
01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:22.117
See, I'm the one
whose ass he kicked.

1057
01:00:22.201 --> 01:00:24.953
But, I'll tell you
one thing, though.

1058
01:00:25.538 --> 01:00:28.332
I don't think he's gonna have a
problem shitting in school anymore.

1059
01:00:28.415 --> 01:00:31.543
Slipped a little something
into his mochaccino.

1060
01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:35.214
Oh, God!

1061
01:00:36.382 --> 01:00:38.550
Oh! Oh!

1062
01:00:44.598 --> 01:00:45.807
Jesus.

1063
01:00:47.309 --> 01:00:49.102
Right this way, sir.

1064
01:00:55.734 --> 01:00:56.985
Oh, God.

1065
01:01:27.766 --> 01:01:28.975
Oh, no.

1066
01:01:30.436 --> 01:01:31.770
It's gonna be fun.

1067
01:01:31.854 --> 01:01:35.148
You know it's just gonna be some
crappy band and stupid decorations.

1068
01:01:35.232 --> 01:01:36.399
You're just
saying that

1069
01:01:36.483 --> 01:01:38.902
because prom's a week away
and you don't have a date.

1070
01:01:38.986 --> 01:01:41.321
No, no, no.
I don't want a date.

1071
01:01:42.281 --> 01:01:46.201
Finch is going stag
and so am I.

1072
01:01:46.285 --> 01:01:49.204
God, he's like so refined.

1073
01:01:50.456 --> 01:01:52.541
You think that older woman
thing is true?

1074
01:01:52.625 --> 01:01:56.003
Yeah, it's true.
It was Stifler's mom.

1075
01:01:59.173 --> 01:02:01.341
Joanie, was that you?

1076
01:02:01.425 --> 01:02:03.635
- Oh!
- Can't hold it.

1077
01:02:03.719 --> 01:02:04.761
Oh!

1078
01:02:11.685 --> 01:02:12.936
Ew!

1079
01:02:35.584 --> 01:02:36.710
Yeah!

1080
01:02:40.005 --> 01:02:42.757
Kev?
I think we've come

1081
01:02:42.841 --> 01:02:44.926
a really long way
since homecoming.

1082
01:02:45.010 --> 01:02:46.469
Yeah, we have.

1083
01:02:46.553 --> 01:02:51.053
Maybe it's time we start to
express ourselves in new ways.

1084
01:02:52.726 --> 01:02:54.769
Yeah.
You wanna do it?

1085
01:02:54.853 --> 01:02:57.730
Yeah.
I love you.

1086
01:02:59.483 --> 01:03:01.026
It's your turn.

1087
01:03:03.070 --> 01:03:05.363
That's not what
I was thinking.

1088
01:03:06.073 --> 01:03:09.618
Sex. It's always about sex.

1089
01:03:09.702 --> 01:03:11.870
It's not always about sex.

1090
01:03:12.871 --> 01:03:15.748
I just thought it was
about sex this time.

1091
01:03:19.336 --> 01:03:23.715
Look, Vicky, love is a term
that gets thrown around

1092
01:03:23.799 --> 01:03:25.967
and, and people
don't mean it.

1093
01:03:26.051 --> 01:03:29.179
When I say it, I want it
to be more than words.

1094
01:03:29.263 --> 01:03:31.932
You know? I want
it to be... Perfect.

1095
01:03:34.226 --> 01:03:35.727
Exactly.

1096
01:03:36.228 --> 01:03:38.772
Okay, Albert. You ready?
No problemo.

1097
01:03:40.065 --> 01:03:43.943
<i>I close my eyes at night</i>

1098
01:03:44.028 --> 01:03:45.738
Come on, Heather.
Work with me here.

1099
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:54.704
Goal, Ostreicher!

1100
01:03:55.205 --> 01:03:58.625
All right, Oz!
Atta boy, Ozzie!

1101
01:03:58.709 --> 01:03:59.876
Yeah, baby!

1102
01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:02.545
- We're crushing you losers!
- Let's go, fellas!

1103
01:04:02.629 --> 01:04:03.838
Come on!

1104
01:04:06.925 --> 01:04:11.304
<i>Bumblebee, bumblebee,
bumblebee, bumblebee, bumblebee</i>

1105
01:04:11.388 --> 01:04:13.723
Focus on the music.
Think melody.

1106
01:04:13.807 --> 01:04:15.183
Let the music be my guide.

1107
01:04:15.267 --> 01:04:16.643
That would be a start.

1108
01:04:27.529 --> 01:04:29.781
Who's the man? Stifler!

1109
01:04:32.284 --> 01:04:34.369
Huddle up, guys! Huddle up!

1110
01:04:42.127 --> 01:04:46.381
Huddle up! Come on! Okay.

1111
01:04:46.465 --> 01:04:48.550
All right, all right!

1112
01:04:48.634 --> 01:04:50.636
Good hustle, guys.
Good hustle.

1113
01:04:50.719 --> 01:04:55.219
But you can still lose. You all
saw what happened to Oz out there.

1114
01:04:55.974 --> 01:05:00.474
I don't want to ever see any of
you thinking you're gonna score.

1115
01:05:01.313 --> 01:05:04.316
You don't score
until you score.

1116
01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:07.027
Until you score.
That's right, baby!

1117
01:05:07.111 --> 01:05:09.655
It all boils down to today.

1118
01:05:09.738 --> 01:05:13.116
For you seniors,
this marks the culmination

1119
01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:16.161
of the past four years.
Culmination.

1120
01:05:17.162 --> 01:05:20.915
I want you to think
about what this means to you.

1121
01:05:20.999 --> 01:05:24.460
Do you guys wanna look back
on your days at East

1122
01:05:24.545 --> 01:05:27.256
and know that you used
the time you had?

1123
01:05:27.339 --> 01:05:30.508
- Hell, yeah!
- You do!

1124
01:05:32.761 --> 01:05:34.679
Good attitude, Ostreicher.

1125
01:05:34.763 --> 01:05:36.139
Good luck, fellas.

1126
01:05:37.057 --> 01:05:40.310
Christ, I didn't tell you
to leave the game.

1127
01:05:40.394 --> 01:05:41.603
I'm sorry, Coach.

1128
01:05:41.687 --> 01:05:44.523
You got someplace more
important to be, Ostreicher?

1129
01:05:44.606 --> 01:05:45.732
Yeah.

1130
01:05:47.568 --> 01:05:48.986
Ostreicher!

1131
01:05:50.028 --> 01:05:53.865
Oz? Fuckface?

1132
01:05:53.949 --> 01:05:55.367
Ostreicher!

1133
01:06:21.602 --> 01:06:23.895
Hey, Oz!
Ozmeister!

1134
01:06:24.855 --> 01:06:26.398
Oh, great.
What about the game?

1135
01:06:26.482 --> 01:06:27.691
I'm not playing.

1136
01:06:27.774 --> 01:06:29.776
You're missing
the game for us?

1137
01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:32.529
No, I'm missing
the game for you.

1138
01:06:35.616 --> 01:06:38.285
Does this mean I'm not
gonna get to do the duet?

1139
01:06:38.368 --> 01:06:39.702
Albert, you suck.

1140
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.876
I don't think
he's coming back.

1141
01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:49.379
<i>Close my eyes at night</i>

1142
01:06:49.463 --> 01:06:50.672
<i>Close my eyes</i>

1143
01:06:50.756 --> 01:06:54.134
<i>Wondering where would I be
without you in my life</i>

1144
01:06:54.218 --> 01:06:55.510
<i>Oh</i>

1145
01:06:55.594 --> 01:06:57.846
<i>Everything I did
was just a bore</i>

1146
01:06:57.930 --> 01:06:59.181
<i>Just a bore</i>

1147
01:06:59.264 --> 01:07:02.976
<i>Everywhere I went
seems I been there before</i>

1148
01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:05.312
<i>But you brighten up for me
But you brighten up for me</i>

1149
01:07:05.437 --> 01:07:07.355
<i>All of my days
All of my days</i>

1150
01:07:07.439 --> 01:07:09.232
<i>With a love so sweet</i>

1151
01:07:09.316 --> 01:07:10.692
<i>In so many ways</i>

1152
01:07:10.776 --> 01:07:13.195
<i>I just wanna stop</i>

1153
01:07:13.278 --> 01:07:15.029
<i>And thank you, baby
And thank you, baby</i>

1154
01:07:15.113 --> 01:07:17.698
<i>I just wanna stop</i>

1155
01:07:17.783 --> 01:07:19.367
<i>And thank you, baby
And thank you, baby</i>

1156
01:07:19.451 --> 01:07:20.910
<i>Thank you, baby</i>

1157
01:07:20.994 --> 01:07:22.996
<i>How sweet it is
How sweet it is</i>

1158
01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:25.624
<i>To be loved by you
To be loved by you</i>

1159
01:07:28.669 --> 01:07:31.171
Yeah, Oz!
You fucking rule!

1160
01:07:31.255 --> 01:07:33.882
Fucking rule!
Yeah!

1161
01:07:36.635 --> 01:07:38.637
Maybe the words
aren't that important.

1162
01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:40.930
It's like, I know he really
cares about me, you know?

1163
01:07:41.014 --> 01:07:43.224
Even if he can't say it,
he does.

1164
01:07:43.308 --> 01:07:47.103
And yeah, he always talks about sex,
but that's okay, 'cause he's a guy, right?

1165
01:07:47.187 --> 01:07:48.813
He's got a dick.
He's a guy.

1166
01:07:48.897 --> 01:07:50.315
Right.

1167
01:07:50.399 --> 01:07:51.817
Wait. Is this
translation right?

1168
01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:54.819
"Go home, bird teacher.
I've had enough."

1169
01:07:54.903 --> 01:07:57.322
I don't know.
I got it from Kevin.

1170
01:07:58.490 --> 01:08:01.493
So, does it hurt?
What?

1171
01:08:01.577 --> 01:08:04.913
You know, sex.
Does it hurt?

1172
01:08:04.997 --> 01:08:08.875
Yeah. I mean, the first time
you do it, you know, it hurts.

1173
01:08:08.959 --> 01:08:13.254
But then you, you do it
again and again and again...

1174
01:08:13.338 --> 01:08:16.382
It just starts to feel good.
Really good.

1175
01:08:16.466 --> 01:08:19.177
Okay, so say
I don't do it.

1176
01:08:20.679 --> 01:08:22.013
And then
I go off to college.

1177
01:08:22.097 --> 01:08:24.432
I might end up doing it
with some random guy

1178
01:08:24.516 --> 01:08:26.434
who totally turns out
to be a jerk.

1179
01:08:26.518 --> 01:08:28.102
This is true.

1180
01:08:28.186 --> 01:08:31.063
And I'll wish I would've
done it with Kevin.

1181
01:08:31.148 --> 01:08:33.066
So go do it with Kevin.

1182
01:08:34.026 --> 01:08:36.445
You think? Yeah.
You're... You're ready.

1183
01:08:36.528 --> 01:08:39.864
You're woman. Look at you.
You're ready for sex.

1184
01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:41.366
You're right.
I know.

1185
01:08:41.491 --> 01:08:43.701
I'm gonna do it. I'm
gonna have sex. Now.

1186
01:08:43.785 --> 01:08:45.912
And it's gonna be right,
and it's gonna be just perfect.

1187
01:08:45.996 --> 01:08:48.206
Perfect sex.
Thanks, Jessica.

1188
01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:49.541
Please.

1189
01:08:51.335 --> 01:08:52.502
Kevin.

1190
01:08:53.795 --> 01:08:55.004
Kevin.

1191
01:08:57.299 --> 01:09:00.552
I wanna
have sex. Now?

1192
01:09:05.724 --> 01:09:06.891
Prom.

1193
01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:14.979
<i>As you walk up those steps
and garner your award</i>

1194
01:09:15.692 --> 01:09:19.779
<i>Try not to forget about me</i>

1195
01:09:19.863 --> 01:09:23.116
<i>'Cause I was there when
you had no one else to hold</i>

1196
01:09:25.410 --> 01:09:28.663
<i>You used to look
just like a saint</i>

1197
01:09:28.747 --> 01:09:30.540
<i>Stumbling towards</i>

1198
01:09:30.624 --> 01:09:34.753
<i>Yours and God's
very own quarantine</i>

1199
01:09:34.836 --> 01:09:39.257
<i>You used to never think
you'd ever grow old</i>

1200
01:09:49.518 --> 01:09:52.103
You must be excited
about the big night tonight.

1201
01:09:52.187 --> 01:09:53.479
Thrilled.

1202
01:09:54.564 --> 01:09:55.815
Who's the lucky girl?

1203
01:09:57.484 --> 01:09:59.360
Michelle.

1204
01:09:59.444 --> 01:10:01.737
Yeah.
Michelle.

1205
01:10:02.614 --> 01:10:04.616
She must be very special.

1206
01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:06.493
Oh, she's special,
all right.

1207
01:10:06.576 --> 01:10:09.787
I'm sure she is special if you
picked her out of the whole bunch.

1208
01:10:13.834 --> 01:10:17.254
Jim, I'm just gonna say one
thing before you leave tonight.

1209
01:10:19.047 --> 01:10:22.091
I want you to be
very, very careful

1210
01:10:23.885 --> 01:10:26.262
when you're putting on

1211
01:10:26.346 --> 01:10:27.805
the corsage.

1212
01:10:32.644 --> 01:10:33.728
Okay, Dad.

1213
01:10:33.812 --> 01:10:35.772
Promise me.
I promise.

1214
01:10:56.752 --> 01:10:56.793
<i>Midnight at the oasis</i>

1215
01:10:56.793 --> 01:11:00.505
<i>Midnight at the oasis</i>

1216
01:11:02.048 --> 01:11:06.052
<i>Send your camel to bed</i>

1217
01:11:07.345 --> 01:11:10.848
<i>Shadows painting our faces</i>

1218
01:11:10.932 --> 01:11:15.432
<i>Traces of romance
in our heads</i>

1219
01:11:17.522 --> 01:11:20.858
<i>Heaven's holding
a half-moon</i>

1220
01:11:22.694 --> 01:11:26.447
<i>Shining just for us</i>

1221
01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:31.578
<i>Let's slip off
to a sand dune</i>

1222
01:11:31.661 --> 01:11:33.788
<i>Real soon</i>

1223
01:11:33.872 --> 01:11:36.958
<i>And kick up a little dust</i>

1224
01:11:37.042 --> 01:11:41.542
<i>Come on
Cactus is our friend</i>

1225
01:11:42.130 --> 01:11:46.259
<i>He'll point out the way</i>

1226
01:11:46.343 --> 01:11:49.095
You know, at band camp,
we have dances like this,

1227
01:11:49.179 --> 01:11:51.139
only they're way funner.

1228
01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:55.810
<i>Till the evening ends</i>

1229
01:11:55.894 --> 01:11:58.062
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

1230
01:12:06.154 --> 01:12:09.240
All right, status check.
Where do you guys stand?

1231
01:12:09.324 --> 01:12:13.119
Finch, we know where you are,
but can't really use that as an excuse.

1232
01:12:13.203 --> 01:12:14.996
Jim?

1233
01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:19.501
My date's a flute-toting band dork.
Does that answer your question?

1234
01:12:19.584 --> 01:12:23.004
Oz, is this vocal-jazz shit
gonna pay off or what?

1235
01:12:23.088 --> 01:12:25.757
Kevin, what's with
the attitude?

1236
01:12:25.841 --> 01:12:28.718
Attitude? Me?

1237
01:12:28.802 --> 01:12:31.429
I think you guys should be
a little more enthusiastic.

1238
01:12:32.222 --> 01:12:34.098
This is the night
we've been waiting for.

1239
01:12:34.182 --> 01:12:36.225
We're in this together.
You guys can't back out.

1240
01:12:36.309 --> 01:12:39.895
Kev, you don't need us to get
laid. Are you afraid or something?

1241
01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:43.274
No. Come on.
We made a pact.

1242
01:12:43.859 --> 01:12:46.653
You can't break that.
You guys are gonna have to...

1243
01:12:46.736 --> 01:12:50.489
Have to what, Kev, huh?
I don't have to do shit.

1244
01:12:50.574 --> 01:12:54.828
Forget it already. I am so sick
and tired of all this bullshit pressure.

1245
01:12:54.911 --> 01:12:59.123
I've never even had sex, and
already, I can't stand it. I hate sex!

1246
01:12:59.207 --> 01:13:02.293
And I'm not gonna stand around here
busting my balls over something that,

1247
01:13:02.377 --> 01:13:05.046
quite frankly,
isn't that damn important.

1248
01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:06.923
I'm gonna go hang out
with that geek over there

1249
01:13:07.007 --> 01:13:11.011
'cause at least she has something
else to talk about besides sex.

1250
01:13:11.094 --> 01:13:12.303
Goddamn.

1251
01:13:14.389 --> 01:13:15.515
Yeah.

1252
01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:20.228
You know, at least I learned
how to shit in school, buddy.

1253
01:13:20.312 --> 01:13:22.188
Hey, Finch.

1254
01:13:22.272 --> 01:13:25.024
Wanna dance?
Yeah.

1255
01:13:26.318 --> 01:13:28.945
<i>Oooh</i>

1256
01:13:30.322 --> 01:13:31.823
How come you have no date?

1257
01:13:31.907 --> 01:13:34.117
I like to keep
my options open.

1258
01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:36.160
I got something for you.

1259
01:13:38.496 --> 01:13:40.164
Consider it
a consolation prize.

1260
01:13:43.335 --> 01:13:45.879
Jessica, this is great! Wow!

1261
01:13:45.962 --> 01:13:48.547
Felt sort of guilty
about taking your money.

1262
01:13:48.632 --> 01:13:50.258
You spent $200 on this?

1263
01:13:50.342 --> 01:13:54.429
No, I spent 50 on the flask,
150 on the earrings.

1264
01:13:56.056 --> 01:13:58.224
These are...
Let me just clarify

1265
01:13:58.308 --> 01:14:00.852
that you have no chance
of scoring with me, Finch.

1266
01:14:00.936 --> 01:14:02.604
Of course not!

1267
01:14:02.687 --> 01:14:05.189
So I take it you and
Sherman are pretty close, huh?

1268
01:14:05.273 --> 01:14:07.316
You met at that party
a while back, right?

1269
01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:09.360
Yeah, we were up
all night together.

1270
01:14:09.444 --> 01:14:12.530
We had one of those
amazingly deep conversations

1271
01:14:12.614 --> 01:14:15.908
where you feel like you
really get to know someone.

1272
01:14:16.868 --> 01:14:18.953
Deep conversation, huh?

1273
01:14:19.037 --> 01:14:21.205
Is that what you call it?

1274
01:14:21.289 --> 01:14:23.207
What else would I call it?

1275
01:14:30.173 --> 01:14:31.883
<i>Thank you, Great Falls.</i>

1276
01:14:31.967 --> 01:14:35.261
<i>We're gonna take a little
break. You are beautiful.</i>

1277
01:14:39.307 --> 01:14:40.599
You suck!

1278
01:14:44.396 --> 01:14:46.231
<i>Excuse me, everyone.</i>

1279
01:14:47.399 --> 01:14:49.609
<i>Sorry to interrupt.</i>

1280
01:14:49.693 --> 01:14:52.237
<i>I just thought
you all should know this.</i>

1281
01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:54.822
<i>Chuck Sherman is a liar.</i>

1282
01:14:54.906 --> 01:14:56.782
<i>I never had sex with him.</i>

1283
01:14:56.866 --> 01:14:58.993
<i>He's never had sex
with anyone.</i>

1284
01:14:59.077 --> 01:15:01.079
<i>I know this because
he told me.</i>

1285
01:15:01.162 --> 01:15:04.290
<i>Once he tried to screw
a grapefruit, but that's all.</i>

1286
01:15:04.374 --> 01:15:06.959
<i>Oh. He also told me
that when he gets nervous,</i>

1287
01:15:07.043 --> 01:15:08.794
<i>he sometimes
wets his pants.</i>

1288
01:15:08.878 --> 01:15:10.838
<i>Thank you for your time.</i>

1289
01:15:25.395 --> 01:15:28.564
Guess what?
Not interested.

1290
01:15:28.648 --> 01:15:33.148
Kevin. Come on, man. The bus
to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.

1291
01:15:33.361 --> 01:15:35.696
I'm not going.
What?

1292
01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:37.031
Why not?

1293
01:15:38.575 --> 01:15:42.161
Look, things didn't really
turn out how I wanted them to.

1294
01:15:43.621 --> 01:15:45.873
I mean, I don't even know
what I'm doing.

1295
01:15:45.957 --> 01:15:49.502
I'm acting like I've got
everything together tonight.

1296
01:15:49.586 --> 01:15:53.381
I know that Vicky's gonna
ask me if I love her, and

1297
01:15:53.465 --> 01:15:55.550
I don't know
what I'm gonna say.

1298
01:15:55.633 --> 01:15:57.217
I mean,
I'm on the brink.

1299
01:15:57.302 --> 01:16:00.972
I'm just about to do it.
I should be psyched.

1300
01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:04.976
I don't know. Maybe you're
right. Maybe I am just scared.

1301
01:16:05.852 --> 01:16:09.063
Come on, Kev.
Tonight is the night.

1302
01:16:09.147 --> 01:16:12.191
We, we are finally going to a
post-prom party on the lake.

1303
01:16:12.275 --> 01:16:15.236
We have been waiting
for this for four years.

1304
01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:18.740
Why else have we been friends
with Stifler all this time, right?

1305
01:16:18.823 --> 01:16:20.366
We were friends
with Stifler?

1306
01:16:21.493 --> 01:16:22.869
Hey, look.

1307
01:16:24.621 --> 01:16:27.332
Sherman didn't
even get laid.

1308
01:16:27.415 --> 01:16:29.834
He didn't?
No, he pissed himself.

1309
01:16:31.294 --> 01:16:32.420
What?

1310
01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:35.924
We'll tell you on the bus.

1311
01:16:36.007 --> 01:16:39.260
I'm gonna go inside
and grab my bag.

1312
01:16:39.344 --> 01:16:41.179
My date, too, perhaps?

1313
01:16:43.556 --> 01:16:45.683
Stifler's mom got it
in the divorce.

1314
01:16:45.767 --> 01:16:47.727
That reminds me
of this one time...

1315
01:16:47.811 --> 01:16:50.605
Hey, can I ask you
a question?

1316
01:16:50.688 --> 01:16:53.440
How come you don't have
any stories? I've got lots of them

1317
01:16:53.525 --> 01:16:55.777
and you don't have any.

1318
01:16:55.860 --> 01:16:59.029
Oh, I've got stories.
Believe me. They're just...

1319
01:16:59.114 --> 01:17:01.866
They're just a little more
risque than tales of band camp.

1320
01:17:01.991 --> 01:17:06.453
Are they gross or something?
Like guy stuff? Tell me!

1321
01:17:06.538 --> 01:17:08.206
Okay. You want a story?

1322
01:17:08.289 --> 01:17:11.000
Here's a story.
Stifler finds this beer...

1323
01:17:14.629 --> 01:17:16.797
This is the nicest room
in the house.

1324
01:17:16.881 --> 01:17:18.340
Kev, it's perfect.

1325
01:17:30.895 --> 01:17:33.272
You guys are gonna
fuck, aren't you?

1326
01:17:33.356 --> 01:17:35.816
Fuckers!
Fuckers, fuckers!

1327
01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:38.611
Fuckers, fuckers, fuckers!

1328
01:17:39.863 --> 01:17:42.156
Out.
Come on!

1329
01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:44.659
Get out.
Man!

1330
01:18:02.552 --> 01:18:04.679
There's something I've been
meaning to tell you, Heather.

1331
01:18:04.762 --> 01:18:07.181
What's that?

1332
01:18:07.265 --> 01:18:10.643
It's gonna sound really
bad, but, I want you to know...

1333
01:18:12.312 --> 01:18:13.688
You see...

1334
01:18:15.064 --> 01:18:17.608
I'm a virgin, and...

1335
01:18:19.402 --> 01:18:22.029
Well, me, Kevin,
Jim and Finch were...

1336
01:18:22.113 --> 01:18:24.615
We all made this pact

1337
01:18:24.699 --> 01:18:27.702
that we would
lose our virginity

1338
01:18:27.785 --> 01:18:30.329
before high school
was over,

1339
01:18:30.413 --> 01:18:34.125
and tonight is supposed to
be the night that we all do it.

1340
01:18:35.043 --> 01:18:37.211
This isn't the best way
to proposition me.

1341
01:18:37.295 --> 01:18:39.880
No, that's...
That's not what I mean.

1342
01:18:39.964 --> 01:18:41.632
What I mean is...

1343
01:18:43.468 --> 01:18:46.554
Look, do you know what
made me leave that game?

1344
01:18:46.638 --> 01:18:50.058
See, Coach, he was
giving us this speech about

1345
01:18:50.141 --> 01:18:53.394
not slacking off when you see
the opportunity to score...

1346
01:18:53.478 --> 01:18:54.937
This isn't
any better, Chris.

1347
01:18:55.021 --> 01:18:57.815
<i>No, see...
You see, Heather,</i>

1348
01:18:57.899 --> 01:19:00.776
what I realized
is that with you,

1349
01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:04.738
it's not like
I'm running towards a goal

1350
01:19:04.822 --> 01:19:07.324
looking for the best way
to score.

1351
01:19:08.368 --> 01:19:11.037
This may sound
a little corny, but,

1352
01:19:11.913 --> 01:19:14.081
l feel like
I've already won.

1353
01:19:16.542 --> 01:19:19.545
And I care about you a lot.

1354
01:19:22.131 --> 01:19:23.507
Oz, I know.

1355
01:19:25.843 --> 01:19:26.927
You called me Oz.

1356
01:19:27.011 --> 01:19:29.346
Well, yeah.

1357
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:31.432
It's what your friends
call you.

1358
01:19:31.516 --> 01:19:34.644
I mean, I feel like
I'm one of your friends now.

1359
01:19:34.727 --> 01:19:37.354
And your girlfriend?

1360
01:19:40.233 --> 01:19:44.612
<i>I never thought
that I could love like this</i>

1361
01:19:44.696 --> 01:19:47.949
<i>This feeling inside me
is growing</i>

1362
01:19:48.032 --> 01:19:52.532
<i>I never thought
that you would come</i>

1363
01:20:12.515 --> 01:20:14.058
Are you lost?

1364
01:20:18.146 --> 01:20:20.982
You're Stifler's mom.

1365
01:20:21.065 --> 01:20:23.150
No, no, not lost. Just...

1366
01:20:24.485 --> 01:20:26.487
You know, taking the tour.

1367
01:20:28.448 --> 01:20:32.076
Hey, thank you for letting us
have this wonderful party.

1368
01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:35.121
As if there was an
alternative in the matter.

1369
01:20:40.585 --> 01:20:42.587
50, YOU enjoying yourself?

1370
01:20:42.670 --> 01:20:45.798
I'm three sheets
to the wind, ma'am.

1371
01:20:46.382 --> 01:20:48.550
I'm so happy for you.

1372
01:20:48.634 --> 01:20:50.344
But it takes the edge off,
doesn't it?

1373
01:20:52.263 --> 01:20:53.847
Where's your
little date tonight?

1374
01:20:53.931 --> 01:20:55.766
No date. It was...

1375
01:20:55.850 --> 01:20:57.977
It was a bathroom incident.

1376
01:20:59.103 --> 01:21:00.395
Pardon me?

1377
01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:01.731
Never mind.

1378
01:21:06.444 --> 01:21:09.155
You have anything to drink?

1379
01:21:09.238 --> 01:21:12.324
I believe the kegs
are upstairs.

1380
01:21:12.408 --> 01:21:14.868
That is what
the cretins drink.

1381
01:21:14.952 --> 01:21:16.954
I'm talking about alcohol,
liquor.

1382
01:21:17.038 --> 01:21:19.999
The good stuff.
All right.

1383
01:21:22.001 --> 01:21:23.794
I got some scotch.

1384
01:21:23.878 --> 01:21:25.045
Single malt?

1385
01:21:25.129 --> 01:21:26.547
Aged 18 years.

1386
01:21:28.383 --> 01:21:30.093
The way I like it.

1387
01:21:34.305 --> 01:21:37.141
Why don't you go grab
a glass from the bar?

1388
01:21:38.768 --> 01:21:40.436
I think I should.

1389
01:21:41.479 --> 01:21:42.813
Allow me.

1390
01:21:44.941 --> 01:21:46.734
You know it's
a bitching party.

1391
01:21:46.818 --> 01:21:49.987
The Stif-man always
comes through in the clutch.

1392
01:21:53.825 --> 01:21:56.494
And then he just
puked his brains out.

1393
01:21:56.577 --> 01:21:59.621
That is a nasty story.
Yep, I told you.

1394
01:21:59.705 --> 01:22:03.667
Do you want to hear a nasty
story of mine? It's sort of sexual.

1395
01:22:05.753 --> 01:22:08.380
Yeah! Yeah, let's hear it.

1396
01:22:08.464 --> 01:22:12.964
Okay, well, this one time at band
camp, we were playing this game.

1397
01:22:13.469 --> 01:22:16.972
I don't know if you know it,
but it's called "Spin the Bottle."

1398
01:22:17.056 --> 01:22:21.143
And I had to kiss this guy
named Mark Wander on the lips.

1399
01:22:21.227 --> 01:22:22.853
And...
And he plays trombone...

1400
01:22:23.521 --> 01:22:25.648
So how do you want to be?

1401
01:22:25.731 --> 01:22:28.400
Like, how do you
want to do it?

1402
01:22:29.735 --> 01:22:32.612
I don't know.
How do you?

1403
01:22:32.697 --> 01:22:37.197
Like normal style.
The missionary position.

1404
01:22:40.079 --> 01:22:41.246
Okay.

1405
01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:48.504
Kay?

1406
01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:52.424
Yeah?
I wanna hear you say it.

1407
01:22:52.508 --> 01:22:53.592
Okay.

1408
01:22:57.054 --> 01:22:58.388
Victoria...

1409
01:23:00.057 --> 01:23:01.433
I love you.

1410
01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:04.394
I love you.

1411
01:23:17.366 --> 01:23:19.159
<i>Don't stray</i>

1412
01:23:19.243 --> 01:23:21.745
<i>Don't ever go away</i>

1413
01:23:21.829 --> 01:23:24.581
<i>I should be much
too smart for this</i>

1414
01:23:24.665 --> 01:23:27.209
<i>You know it gets
the better of me</i>

1415
01:23:27.293 --> 01:23:31.505
<i>Sometimes,
when you and I collide</i>

1416
01:23:31.589 --> 01:23:32.715
Oh. My hair.

1417
01:23:32.798 --> 01:23:34.633
<i>I fall into
an ocean of you</i>

1418
01:23:34.717 --> 01:23:36.760
<i>Pull me out in time</i>

1419
01:23:36.844 --> 01:23:38.679
<i>Don't let me drown</i>

1420
01:23:38.763 --> 01:23:41.056
<i>Let me down</i>

1421
01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:42.432
You Okay?

1422
01:23:43.643 --> 01:23:46.687
Yeah. Go slow.

1423
01:23:47.688 --> 01:23:50.399
<i>Say you'll stay</i>

1424
01:23:50.483 --> 01:23:53.944
<i>Don't come and go</i>

1425
01:23:54.028 --> 01:23:56.071
<i>Like you do</i>

1426
01:23:57.865 --> 01:24:00.534
<i>Sway my Way</i>

1427
01:24:00.618 --> 01:24:03.704
<i>Yeah, I need to know</i>

1428
01:24:03.788 --> 01:24:06.457
<i>All about you</i>

1429
01:24:07.959 --> 01:24:10.294
<i>Say you'll stay</i>

1430
01:24:10.378 --> 01:24:12.880
So the end of
the story is you

1431
01:24:12.964 --> 01:24:15.508
had to kiss the guy
for 20 seconds.

1432
01:24:15.591 --> 01:24:19.678
Yes! And he was such a dork.
Everyone laughed at me

1433
01:24:19.762 --> 01:24:22.181
but I didn't care
because it was so funny.

1434
01:24:22.265 --> 01:24:23.557
I get it.

1435
01:24:23.641 --> 01:24:27.478
And this one time at band
camp, I stuck a flute in my pussy.

1436
01:24:31.315 --> 01:24:32.441
Excuse me?

1437
01:24:32.525 --> 01:24:35.236
What? You don't think
I know how to get myself off?

1438
01:24:35.319 --> 01:24:38.697
Hell, that's what half of
band camp is. Sex Ed.

1439
01:24:38.781 --> 01:24:42.493
So are we gonna screw soon?
'Cause I'm getting kinda antsy.

1440
01:24:50.710 --> 01:24:52.086
This'll do.

1441
01:24:54.839 --> 01:24:55.881
Ow!

1442
01:24:58.843 --> 01:25:03.343
Now, I have two rubbers. Wear
them both. It'll desensitize you.

1443
01:25:03.431 --> 01:25:06.600
I don't want you coming
so damn early this time.

1444
01:25:08.144 --> 01:25:10.271
What makes you think
that I would come early?

1445
01:25:10.354 --> 01:25:12.606
Come on.
I saw you on the net.

1446
01:25:12.690 --> 01:25:14.692
Why do you think
I accepted this date?

1447
01:25:14.775 --> 01:25:16.568
You're a sure thing.

1448
01:25:19.488 --> 01:25:20.864
Yes, I am.

1449
01:25:22.617 --> 01:25:26.662
So I said, "This is very obviously
a Piero della Francesca."

1450
01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:38.920
So, would you object if I said
that you were quite striking?

1451
01:25:41.260 --> 01:25:45.138
Mr. Finch, are you
trying to seduce me?

1452
01:25:45.222 --> 01:25:46.473
Yes, ma'am, I am.

1453
01:25:46.557 --> 01:25:49.685
<i>And here's to you,
Mrs. Robinson</i>

1454
01:25:49.769 --> 01:25:54.190
<i>Jesus loves you
more than you will know</i>

1455
01:25:54.273 --> 01:25:56.817
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa</i>

1456
01:25:56.901 --> 01:26:00.154
<i>Stand up tall,
Mrs. Robinson</i>

1457
01:26:00.237 --> 01:26:02.113
<i>God in heaven smiles
on those who pray</i>

1458
01:26:02.198 --> 01:26:04.200
You're dead.

1459
01:26:04.283 --> 01:26:06.660
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

1460
01:26:06.744 --> 01:26:08.162
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

1461
01:26:11.165 --> 01:26:13.750
<i>Sway my Way</i>

1462
01:26:13.834 --> 01:26:16.837
<i>Yeah, I need to know</i>

1463
01:26:16.921 --> 01:26:20.341
<i>All about you</i>

1464
01:26:20.424 --> 01:26:22.968
<i>And there's no cure</i>

1465
01:26:23.052 --> 01:26:25.596
<i>And no way to be sure</i>

1466
01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:28.140
<i>Why everything's
turned inside out</i>

1467
01:26:28.224 --> 01:26:30.142
<i>instilling so much doubt</i>

1468
01:26:30.226 --> 01:26:32.603
<i>It makes me so tired</i>

1469
01:26:32.687 --> 01:26:35.481
<i>I feel so uninspired</i>

1470
01:26:35.564 --> 01:26:38.149
<i>My head is battling
with my heart</i>

1471
01:26:38.234 --> 01:26:41.987
<i>My logic has been torn apart
And now</i>

1472
01:26:42.113 --> 01:26:44.532
- I had no idea you'd be this good.
- Neither did I.

1473
01:26:44.615 --> 01:26:46.491
Oh, Finchy. Finch.

1474
01:26:46.575 --> 01:26:49.494
Oh, Stifler's mom, whoa!
Finchy!

1475
01:26:57.878 --> 01:26:59.004
Okay, let's go.

1476
01:26:59.088 --> 01:27:01.381
What's my name?
Say my name, bitch!

1477
01:27:01.465 --> 01:27:03.341
Michelle, Michelle.

1478
01:27:05.010 --> 01:27:06.302
JIM; Oh, God.

1479
01:27:34.915 --> 01:27:36.666
That was a great night, huh?

1480
01:27:40.254 --> 01:27:41.421
Yeah.

1481
01:27:43.007 --> 01:27:46.260
I mean, I just can't believe
we had our senior prom.

1482
01:27:46.343 --> 01:27:48.428
I know.

1483
01:27:48.512 --> 01:27:50.514
It went by so fast.

1484
01:27:50.598 --> 01:27:52.057
Yeah, it did.

1485
01:27:53.184 --> 01:27:54.351
Kevin?

1486
01:27:59.523 --> 01:28:03.276
Next year with you going to
Ann Arbor and me going to Ithaca,

1487
01:28:05.279 --> 01:28:07.406
it's not gonna work, is it?

1488
01:28:08.491 --> 01:28:10.618
No. Don't say that.

1489
01:28:10.701 --> 01:28:13.286
I mean,
we could make it work.

1490
01:28:14.497 --> 01:28:16.874
It'll be perfect.
No, Kevin.

1491
01:28:18.834 --> 01:28:21.169
But... See, that's
what I've been realizing

1492
01:28:21.253 --> 01:28:24.339
is that nothing's perfect.

1493
01:28:24.423 --> 01:28:26.675
And you can't
plan everything.

1494
01:28:28.719 --> 01:28:32.055
Well, I guess
you will be pretty far away.

1495
01:28:33.766 --> 01:28:36.685
And we'll be on our own,
meeting new people.

1496
01:28:41.190 --> 01:28:42.941
Last night, though.

1497
01:28:46.779 --> 01:28:48.405
I wasn't lying.

1498
01:28:50.991 --> 01:28:52.242
I know.

1499
01:29:08.759 --> 01:29:10.177
She's gone.

1500
01:29:12.429 --> 01:29:14.305
Oh, my God.
She used me.

1501
01:29:14.390 --> 01:29:15.766
I was used.

1502
01:29:18.435 --> 01:29:19.811
I was used.

1503
01:29:20.771 --> 01:29:21.855
Cool!

1504
01:29:24.316 --> 01:29:26.026
What's this door locked...

1505
01:29:26.110 --> 01:29:27.820
Mom, where's...

1506
01:29:29.572 --> 01:29:32.324
Mom? Shit-brick?

1507
01:29:32.408 --> 01:29:33.659
Hey, Stifler.

1508
01:29:36.245 --> 01:29:38.705
<i>Do do do
Do do do do</i>

1509
01:29:39.331 --> 01:29:41.624
I just gotta say
that women,

1510
01:29:43.002 --> 01:29:46.714
like a fine wine,
only get better with age.

1511
01:29:46.797 --> 01:29:50.926
Of course, I have no basis
for comparison, but

1512
01:29:51.010 --> 01:29:52.302
it was good.

1513
01:29:52.386 --> 01:29:54.721
So you almost made it,
huh, Oz?

1514
01:29:54.805 --> 01:29:57.182
I'll just say that we had
a great night together.

1515
01:29:57.266 --> 01:29:59.226
Hang in there, buddy.

1516
01:29:59.310 --> 01:30:00.644
You'll get there.

1517
01:30:00.728 --> 01:30:03.772
You know, guys, I
think we're falling in love.

1518
01:30:06.150 --> 01:30:07.442
Wow.

1519
01:30:07.526 --> 01:30:09.986
That's great, man.
That's awesome.

1520
01:30:11.322 --> 01:30:14.158
You know what
the coolest thing is, guys?

1521
01:30:14.241 --> 01:30:16.785
It's this.
You know, right now.

1522
01:30:16.869 --> 01:30:20.205
It's true. I mean, after this,
everything's gonna be different.

1523
01:30:20.289 --> 01:30:22.040
After getting laid?

1524
01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:24.918
After high school.

1525
01:30:25.002 --> 01:30:26.712
Here's to the next step.

1526
01:30:26.795 --> 01:30:27.796
To the next step.

1527
01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:29.172
To the next step.

1528
01:30:29.256 --> 01:30:30.924

01:30:56.742 --> 01:30:58.785
<i>Like Harrison Ford
I'm getting frantic</i>

1538
01:30:58.869 --> 01:31:01.204
<i>Like Sting I'm tantric Like
Snickers guaranteed to satisfy</i>

1539
01:31:01.288 --> 01:31:03.123
<i>Like Kurosawa
I make mad films</i>

1540
01:31:03.207 --> 01:31:05.417
<i>Okay, I don't make films but
if I did they'd have a samurai</i>

1541
01:31:05.501 --> 01:31:08.003
<i>Gonna get a set of better clubs
gonna find the kind with tiny nubs</i>

1542
01:31:08.087 --> 01:31:09.797
<i>So my irons aren't always
flying off the backswing</i>

1543
01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:11.715
<i>Gonna get in tune with
Sailor Moon 'cause that cartoon</i>

1544
01:31:11.799 --> 01:31:14.176
<i>Has got the boom anime babes
that make me think the wrong thing</i>

1545
01:31:14.259 --> 01:31:16.219
<i>How can I help it if I think
you're funny when you're mad</i>

1546
01:31:16.303 --> 01:31:18.471
<i>Trying hard not to smile
though I feel bad</i>

1547
01:31:18.555 --> 01:31:20.098
<i>I'm the kind of guy
who laughs at a funeral</i>

1548
01:31:20.182 --> 01:31:21.308
Sweetheart?

1549
01:31:21.392 --> 01:31:21.767
<i>Can't understand what I mean
You soon will</i>

1550
01:31:21.767 --> 01:31:21.850
<i>Can't understand what I mean
You soon will</i>

1551
01:31:21.850 --> 01:31:22.684
<i>Can't understand what I mean
You soon will</i>

1552
01:31:22.768 --> 01:31:24.644
<i>It's been one week
since you looked at me</i>

1553
01:31:24.728 --> 01:31:26.479
<i>Dropped your arms to
the side and said, I'm sorry</i>

1554
01:31:26.563 --> 01:31:30.817
<i>Hello to your mother your
brother significant other</i>

<i>And I'm here
to free your mind</i>

1557
01:31:41.078 --> 01:31:44.998
<i>Kick off your shoes the blues
and use anything but your mind</i>

1558
01:31:45.082 --> 01:31:49.582
<i>'Cause this is
the summertime</i>

1559
01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:54.420
<i>And it's here
to free your mind</i>

1560
01:31:55.676 --> 01:32:00.176
<i>How many other people
can you save today?</i>

1561
01:32:00.472 --> 01:32:04.972
<i>Don't you think it's high
time that you sail away?</i>

1562
01:32:05.394 --> 01:32:09.894
<i>Leave today
Don't fall behind</i>

1563
01:32:10.274 --> 01:32:14.361
<i>Try something new Turn
into you if only for a short time</i>

1564
01:32:14.445 --> 01:32:18.945
<i>I am the summertime</i>

1565
01:32:19.116 --> 01:32:23.616
<i>And I'm here
to free your mind</i>

1566
01:32:33.797 --> 01:32:36.257
<i>Love is tragic
Love is bold</i>

1567
01:32:36.341 --> 01:32:40.053
<i>You will always do
what you are told</i>

1568
01:32:44.183 --> 01:32:46.727
<i>Love is hard
Love is strong</i>

1569
01:32:46.810 --> 01:32:49.979
<i>You will never say
that you were wrong</i>

1570
01:32:54.610 --> 01:32:57.237
<i>I don't know
when I got bitter</i>

1571
01:32:57.321 --> 01:33:01.821
<i>Love is surely better
when it's gone</i>

1572
01:33:03.702 --> 01:33:06.329
<i>'Cause you wanted more</i>

1573
01:33:06.413 --> 01:33:08.915
<i>More than I could give</i>

1574
01:33:08.999 --> 01:33:11.584
<i>More than I could handle</i>

1575
01:33:11.668 --> 01:33:14.379
<i>And a life
that I can't live</i>

1576
01:33:14.463 --> 01:33:16.923

<i>And a love
that isn't there</i>

1580
01:33:36.777 --> 01:33:39.446
<i>Love is color
Love is love</i>

1581
01:33:39.530 --> 01:33:42.616
<i>Love is never saying
you're too proud</i>

1582
01:33:47.246 --> 01:33:49.873
<i>Love is trusting
Love is honest</i>

1583
01:33:49.957 --> 01:33:53.251
<i>Love is not a hand
that holds you down</i>

1584
01:33:57.714 --> 01:34:00.299
<i>I don't know
when I got bitter</i>

1585
01:34:00.384 --> 01:34:04.884

better when it's gone</i>

when I am down</i>

1595
01:34:37.546 --> 01:34:41.091

on the ground</i>
