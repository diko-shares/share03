00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.150
Ohh, you're so good.

2
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.150
Ohh, yes. I am the best, baby.

3
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.150
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh. Oh, that was a tit.

4
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.160
- That is a tit! Yes!

5
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.160
Oh, you're so big!

6
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.160
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that's right, baby.

7
00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.160
- Oh, doggie wants to hide his bone.
- Yes!

8
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.160
Oh, yeah!
I'm bone smuggling, baby.

9
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.160
- Man, would you shut up!

10
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.160
Hey, Jimmy.
Just wanted to say sweet dreams.

11
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.160
Yeah, yeah.
Sweet dreams. Good night, Mom.

12
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.160
- Kiss good night.

13
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.160
- Something wrong with the reception?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.

14
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.120
- There's this nature show
I'm trying to watch.
- Take it off.

15
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.120
- The birds are all scrambled
and I can't even—
- Do me! Yes!

16
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.120
- Baby! Ride me like a pony!

17
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.120
- The thing must be broken or I
sat on the remote or something.

18
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.120
- Getting ready for bed, son?
- Yup, I'm all set, Dad. I'm all set.

19
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.120
- Yeah?
- No! I think he's trying
to watch some illegal channels.

20
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.120
- Illegal— Illegal channels?
- This is just bad reception, honey.

21
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.120
- Oh, spank my hairy ass!
- What's that?

22
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.120
- Ooh, baby!
- You know what? Here.
Just give me this, please—

23
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.120
- Oh, my God!
- And let's get this— Ohh!

24
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.120
Okay, okay. Let's, uh— What the hell's
the matter with this thing?

25
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.120
Yes!

26
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.090
Illegal channels?
Shit!

27
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.080
If there's any channel that should be
illegal, it's that all-woman's channel.

28
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.090
- Lifetime supply of pantyhose or some shit.
- Yeah.

29
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.090
Hey, uh, did you see The Little Mermaid
on TV the other night?

30
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.090
- No.
- Ariel, man. She's so hot!

31
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.090
- Yeah, Oz. But not when she's on land.
- She's a mermaid, dude.

32
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.090
Come on, Vicky, it's Stifler's
party. We got to go. It'll be great.

33
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.090
Why? All that happens at Stifler's parties
is people get drunk and do it.

34
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.090
Yeah.

35
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.090
Now, come on, Kevin.
Open it.

36
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.090
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky.
You got in.

37
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.090
If you think so, just open it.

38
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.050
- Fine.

39
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.050
Hmm.

40
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.050
"Dear Miss Latham: We're sorry but
after keeping you on the waiting list...

41
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.050
for the past couple of months, we've
decided that you are now rejected."

42
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.050
- Shut up!

43
00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.050
- You got in.
- Yes! I love you!

44
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.050
Okay.

45
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.050
Hey, you think I should wear
this shirt to Stifler's party?

46
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.060
You've worn that shirt for,
like, three days in a row, man!

47
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.060
Guys.
She said it.

48
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.060
- Said what?
- She said she loves me.

49
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.020
- Holy shit, dude! The "L" word?
- Oh, man!

50
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.020
Cornell's not that far from UofM.

51
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.020
Yeah, it's only, like, seven hours.

52
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.020
Oh, and you get
to drive across Canada.

53
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.020
- Beautiful country.
- Whatever. It's doable.

54
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.020
Wh-What we should
do today, in band.

55
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.020
Instead of playing our instruments
regularly, we should play them backwards.

56
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.020
- That'll be so funny!
- Yeah.

57
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.020
No offence, but you're talking about
a post-high school,
long-distance relationship.

58
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.020
And you and Kevin
haven't even done it yet.

59
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.020
That's not why we're going out.

60
00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.020
What do you expect him to drive
to Cornell for? Milk and cookies?

61
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.020
We're going to have sex
when he's ready and I'm ready.

62
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.980
It's got to be completely perfect.

63
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.980
I want the right time,
the right moment, the right place—

64
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.980
Vicky, it's not
a space shuttle launch. It's sex.

65
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.980
- Finch.
- Here's the man we are looking for.

66
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.980
- Gentlemen.
- What's going on, buddy?

67
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.980
- Same ol'--
- Finch. You got the Latin homework?

68
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.990
Oh.

69
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.990
It means, "My dog ate it."
It's Latin. It's a joke.

70
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.990
- It's a Latin joke.
- Yeah, Latin. Just drink your coffee.

71
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.990
- No, Jim, it's mochaccino.
- What?

72
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.990
What I'm drinking, it's mochaccino.
It's not coffee.

73
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.990
'Nova!

74
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.950
- What's up, dude?

75
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.950
You coming to the party
tonight, Ozzie, you fuckface?

76
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.950
Uh, depends if my date
wants to stop by.

77
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.950
- I'm working on something new.
- I got an idea about something new.

78
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.950
How about you guys
actually locate your dicks,

79
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.950
remove the shrink-wrap
and fucking use them!

80
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.950
Dude, it's going to happen.
She's a college chick.

81
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.950
Oh, right.
I'll see you guys tonight.

82
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.950
I'll look for you
in the no-fucking section.

83
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.950
All right. I'm shooting for a 9:00 ETA.
Beer in hand by five after.

84
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.950
Breath check.

85
00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.950
- Thank you.

86
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.910
- I wish you wouldn't do that.
- So, you got something
up your sleeve for tonight?

87
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.910
This is a foolproof plan,
my friend.

88
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.910
I have a serious question
to ask you guys. Okay.

89
00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.910
You know Nadia the Czechoslovakian
chick? She might be there tonight.

90
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:41.910
Now, do you think she would prefer...

91
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.920
laid-back Jim...

92
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:47.920
or...

93
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.920
cool, hip Jim?

94
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.920
I don't think it really matters
with that shirt you're wearing.

95
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.920
What? Correct me if I'm wrong but
you're the one with the girlfriend...

96
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.920
and you're still
stranded on third base.

97
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.920
Hey, at least I know what
third base feels like, okay?

98
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.920
- You're still just a batboy.
- Batboy. Batboy.

99
00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.920
- What are you talking about?

100
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.880
Guys, uh—

101
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.880
What exactly does
third base feel like?

102
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.880
You want to take this one?

103
00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.880
- Like warm apple pie.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

104
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.880
- Apple pie, huh?
- Uh-huh.

105
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.880
- McDonald's or homemade?

106
00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.880
Gentlemen, destiny awaits.

107
00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.880

111
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.880

Nadia! Buenos dias.
Glad you could make it.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.840
- Another party sultan!
- How you doing?

116
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.850
Welcome to Stifler's
Palace of Love, fellows.

117

Vicky, Jessica! Great to see you.
Glad you could make it.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.850
Haha, bitches!

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:23.850
Fellows!
What's going on?

124
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.850
Sherman. Not much.
Just, uh, scoping the babes.

125
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.810
- Indeed! Some fine ladies here, boys.
- Uh-huh.

126
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.810
Confidence is high.
Repeat. Confidence is high.

127
00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:36.810
Sherman is moving to DEFCON 2.

128
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.810
- Full strategic arsenal
ready for deployment.

129
00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:42.810
You have something
going tonight, Sherman?

130
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.810
You see that
Central chick, Bernette?

131
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.810
- Um, no.
- No.

132
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.810
She's around.
Seems she's taken a liking to me.

133
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.810
Fellows, it's time she experienced...
the Shermanator.

134
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:57.810
Yeah, okay, Sherman. Whatever.

135
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:01.810

What party?
There's no party.

161
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:58.710
Weird.
Try the house down the street.

162
00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.710
So, what's your major?

163
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:07.710
Post-modern feminist thought.

164
00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.710
Oh, cool.
Great night, isn't it?

165
00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:13.710
Sure.

166
00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:19.670
Yeah, it's just something about the
springtime that's just cool, you know?

167
00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:23.670
- Like the smell of fresh rain or something.
- Mmm.

168
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.670
Suck me, beautiful.

169
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:28.670
What did you just say?

170
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:32.670
- Suck me, beautiful.

171
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:37.670
My friends call me "'Nova,"
as in Casanova.

172
00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:40.680
That's pathetic.

173
00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:43.680
Jeez, you don't
have to laugh at me.

174
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.680
Well, there's just some things
you need to learn, that's all.

175
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.680
- Like what?
- Well, you've got to tone it down.

176
00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:50.680
You don't need to come
to a place like Lookout Point...

177
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.680
and spout off
cheeseball lines to be romantic.

178
00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.680
- Okay.
- You have to pay attention to a girl.

179
00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:01.640
Be sensitive to her feelings.
Relationships are reciprocal.

180
00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:05.640
Come on, Casanova.
I'll take you back to your friends.

181
00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.640
Vicky, think it's time to take
the next step in our relationship?

182
00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.640
- Tonight?
- Yeah, it's such a perfect evening.

183
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.640
I mean, it's how you've
always pictured it, isn't it?

184
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.640
Damn, my parts fucking stink!

185
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.640
Dude, you got to take a shit!
You smell like a Yeti!

186
00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.640
Or not.

187
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.640
Just relax.

188
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.640
You actually said that?

189
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.600
- Shut up!

190
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.600
You did a hell of a lot better
than I did with Nadia.

191
00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.600
Oh, thanks, Jim, that's great.
That's really reassuring.

192
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.600
Hey, no problem, 'Nova.

193
00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.600
Hey, don't call me 'Nova anymore.
I'm a— I'm a fraud.

194
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:56.600
You guys are pathetic.

195
00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.610
I'm going to find myself
a little hottie.

196
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:03.610
"Suck me, beautiful"!

197
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.610
- Let me know.
- Okay.

198
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:13.610
Keep going.

199
00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:15.610
I should be able
to talk to girls.

200
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.610
I'm articulate.

201
00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:20.610
You know, I got a 720
on my S.A.T. verbal.

202
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.570
Bullshit.
There's no way.

203
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:27.570
I kid you not, man.
Look. Listen.

204
00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:31.570
- Copious. Verisimilitude.
- Mmm.

205
00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.570
Oh, ohh. Now.

206
00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:38.570
Ohh.

207
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.570
Suck me, beautiful!

208
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.570
- Damn it, Stifler.
- Checkout time!

209
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:55.570
- Please, vacate the room.
- You are such a jerk.

210
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.570
God, I can't believe how many
cool people are at this party.

211
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:06.530
Yup.

212
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.530
And you got a keg too!

213
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:11.530
- Wow!
- Indeed.

214
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.540
Oh, wait.
I left my beer downstairs.

215
00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.540
No. No.
Here, babe!

216
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.540
Thanks.

217
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.540
You're really beautiful. Oh—

218
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.540
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

219
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.500
You know what? I don't know
if I want to be doing this.

220
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.500
- Doing what?
- You know, like, if we hook up tonight,

221
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.500
tomorrow I'll just be some girl
you go telling all your friends about.

222
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.500
No way!

223
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.500
Steve, you could at least look at me
when you say that!

224
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.500
Look. Sarah,

225
00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.500
I— I wouldn't go telling
stories or anything about you.

226
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:17.500
I promise.
So, just... relax,

227
00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:21.510
take it slow...
and let the good times roll.

228
00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.460
- Okay.
- All right.

229
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.470
What's wrong?

230
00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:40.470
What's wrong?
What is it?

231
00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:47.470
- Xenophobic.

232
00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:51.470
Oh!

233
00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:54.470
- Regurgitation.
- I know that one.

234
00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:59.470
- Kevin likes it.
- He likes getting head.

235
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:01.470
Gee, what a total shocker.
What about you, Vicky?

236
00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:04.470
I mean, h-have you just
never had one with Kevin...

237
00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:06.470
or have you never
had one, period?

238
00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:08.430
I've had one.

239
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:10.430
- I think.
- Okay.

240
00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:14.430
That's a no. No wonder
you're not psyched about sex.

241
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:16.430
You tell me you never
even had one manually?

242
00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:20.430
- I've never tried it.
- You've never double-clicked your mouse?

243
00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:23.430
- Ha-ha, nice!

244
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.430
- Jesus! Stifler,
how much did you drink, man?

245
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:30.430
Hey, Stifler?
How's the pale ale?

246
00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:33.430
- Fuck you!
- Ooh, whoo!

247
00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:38.440
- That's Stifler's mom?
- Yup.

248
00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:43.440
Shit. I cannot believe a fine woman
like this produced a guy like Stifler.

249
00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:47.440
- Dude, that chick's a "MILF."
- What the hell is that?

250
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.400
- M-I-L-F— Mom I'd like to fuck.
- Yeah, dude!

251
00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.400
Oh-ho, yeah!

252
00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.400
- Yeah! MILF! MILF!
- Hey, guys— Guys. Guys.

253
00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:00.400
- Come here.
- Sherman, what's going on?

254
00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.400
Yeah, uh— Don't you think you fellows
could try a little tact?

255
00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:09.400
I got company,
if you know what I mean?

256
00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.400
She's hot!

257
00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:21.400
If Sherman has sex before I do,
I'm going to be really pissed.

258
00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:26.400
Sherman?
The Shermanator?

259
00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.400
- Come on, man.

260
00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.360
MILF! MILF!

261
00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:37.360
MILF! MILF! Dude, hey, dude.
What are you doing to her, dude?

262
00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:41.360
Oh, my God, bro, dude.

263
00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:44.360
- Enough of this blow job bullshit.

264
00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:48.360
- I've got to get laid already.
- That's nice. Really, really nice.

265
00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.360
- Can I have a ride?
- Sure.

266
00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.370
- Vicky, wait.
- Not for you.

267
00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:59.370
Yeti!
I am the Yeti!

268
00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:10.370
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Finch.

269
00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:14.330
Where were you last night, huh?
What happened to that foolproof plan of yours?

270
00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:17.330
Well, I was going for a fashionably-late
entrance and I was too late.

271
00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:20.330
So, no ladies left.

272
00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:23.330
It was a very
special night, very special.

273
00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:25.330
- Guys. Guys.

274
00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:32.330
- I'll never forget this.
- Oh, I'll never forget it, either.

275
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:36.330
- Thank you.
- Uhh.

276
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:40.330
- Well, bye.
- Bye.

277
00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:42.330
Bye.

278
00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:48.330
Fellows, say good-bye
to Chuck Sherman, the boy.

279
00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:51.330
I... am now a man.

280
00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:54.330
I highly recommend
you join the club.

281
00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:59.290
We were doing the wild thing...
all night. I'm exhausted.

282
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:02.290
I don't get it. I mean,
how the hell did you do that?

283
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:07.290
It was just my time.
It was just my time.

284
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.300
Best of luck to you boys.

285
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.300
- I cannot believe this.
- Come on, guys.

286
00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:19.300
You know, we should
be happy for Sherman.

287
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.300
No, we shouldn't be.

288
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.300
You know, I put in months
of quality time with Vicky.

289
00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.300
Sherman meets a chick
for one night and scores.

290
00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.300
- This is just wrong.
- No shit.

291
00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.300
How the hell am I supposed
to become Mr. Sensitive Man?

292
00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.260
You know, we're all going to go to college
as virgins. You realize this, right?

293
00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.260
I mean, they probably have special dorms
for people like us.

294
00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.260
All right. I got an idea.
But it's got to stay between us.

295
00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.260
It's really simple. We just
got to make an agreement.

296
00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.260
Er, nah. It's—
It's more than an agreement.

297
00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.260
- What? A bet?
- A pact.

298
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.260
No money involved.
More important than any bet.

299
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.260
Here's the deal.
We all get laid before we graduate.

300
00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.260
Dude, it's not like I haven't
been trying to get laid.

301
00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.260
Think about when you work out, Oz.
You got to have someone there, right?

302
00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.260
Someone to spot you.
Someone to keep you motivated.

303
00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.260
Well, that's exactly what
we can do for each other.

304
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.270
I mean, we'll be there
to keep each other on track.

305
00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.260
Separately, we are flawed
and vulnerable, but together,

306
00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.220
we are the masters
of our sexual destiny.

307
00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.220
Their tiger-style
kung fu is strong.

308
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.220
But our dragon-style
will defeat it.

309
00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:27.230
- Guys!
- The Shaolin masters from East and West must unite!

310
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.230
- Fight, and find out who is number one.
- Guys!

311
00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:34.230
Come on. You're ruining my moment here.
This is our very manhood at stake.

312
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:37.230
We must make a stand,
here and now.

313
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:42.230
No longer will our penises
remain flaccid and unused!

314
00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:46.230
We will fight for every man out there
who isn't getting laid and should be.

315
00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:49.230
This is our day.
This is our time.

316
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:54.230
And, by God, we will not stand by and
watch history condemn us into celibacy.

317
00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:56.230
- Amen. Yes.
- I like that.

318
00:19:56.690 --> 00:20:00.190
- We will make a stand. We will succeed.
- About time!

319
00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:03.190
- We will get laid!
- Yeah! Yeah!

320
00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:08.190
Now, the sex: It's got
to be valid, consensual sex.

321
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:12.190
- No prostitutes.
That's what you're thinking, Finch.

322
00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:14.190
Busted.

323
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:17.190
So, basically,
prom is our last chance.

324
00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:19.190
- Oh, dude. Prom sucks.
- I know,

325
00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:21.190
but you've got to think
about it this way.

326
00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:25.190
I mean, all the parties afterwards?
The chicks are going to want to do it.

327
00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:29.190
- Yeah, he's right. It's tradition or something.
- The Rose Bowl.

328
00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:34.200
- So, that gives us—
- Exactly three weeks to the day.

329
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:39.200
- We're going to do this.
- All right, to the next step!
- Next step!

330
00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:40.200
Next step!

331
00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:42.150

- Do you love her?

- Do you love her?

358
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:11.090
Um, you know what?
You can't really ask me that.

359
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:14.090
Well, if you want to get
her in the sack, I mean,
just tell her you love her.

All right.
What you need to do...

363
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:25.090
is learn how to press
a girl's buttons.

364
00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:27.090
You have to give her
what she's never had.

365
00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:31.090
- What's that?
- Let me give you a hint.

Ohh, Kev! Uhh. Yeah.

- Well, you know,

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.090
I'm-I'm pretty sure that I've...
given her a—

370
00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:47.050
- No, you haven't.
- Well, there was one time—

371
00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:50.050
- No.
- Oh, man.

372
00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:55.050

- Hey, guys. Came to watch me in action?
- Yeah.

382
00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.020
- I-I think you sounded pretty good.
- Yeah, man.

383
00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.020
I think you need
your balls reattached.

384
00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.020
- Hey, keep it down, dude.
- What the fuck are you doing here?

385
00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.020
This place
is an untapped resource.

386
00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.020
I mean, check it out.

387
00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.020
- These vocal jazz girls are hot.
- Why the hell is he joining jazz choir so late?

388
00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.020
- Maybe he's preparing for
another senior year at East?

389
00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:55.020
You guys, we don't even know him.

390
00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.020
You dipshit!

391
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.020
You're expecting
to score with some...

392
00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.020
goody-goody choirgirl priss?

393
00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.020
These chicks don't know me. I can work
the sensitive angle here, fellows!

394
00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:09.980
You know, it's just like
that college chick told me.

395
00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.980
All that you got to do
is just ask 'em questions...

396
00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.980
and listen to what
they have to say and shit.

397
00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.980
I don't know, man.
That sounds like a lot of work!

398
00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.990
- Uh, just a second!

399
00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:30.990
Come in. Come in.

400
00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:33.990
Oh, Jim, you're here.

401
00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:37.990
Uh, I was just walking
by your room and uh—

402
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:41.990
And, you know, I was thinking, "Boy,
it's been a long time since we've had...

403
00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:43.990
a little
father-son, uh-uh, chat."

404
00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:49.990
Oh! I almost forgot.
I, uh, I bought some magazines.

405
00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:52.950
Do you just want to flip
to the centre section?

406
00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:57.950
Well, this is the—
this is the, uh, female form.

407
00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:00.950
And they have
focused on the breasts,

408
00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:05.950
uh, which are used primarily
to, uh, feed young infants...

409
00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:09.950
- and, uh— and also, uh, in foreplay.
- Right.

410
00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:13.950
This is, uh—
This is Hustler.

411
00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:17.950
And this is a much
more exotic magazine.

412
00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:21.950
Now, they have decided to focus
on the, uh, pubic region—

413
00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:25.950
- Right. Uh-huh.
- The whole groin area.

414
00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:29.950
Look at the expression on her face.
You see that? See what's she's doing?

415
00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:32.910
She's kind of looking
right into your eyes saying,

416
00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:36.910
"Hey, big boy.
Hey, how you doing?"

417
00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.920
- You see?
- Right.

418
00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.920
Shaved is a magazine
I'm not too familiar with,

419
00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:49.920
- but, again,
if you flip to the centre...

420
00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:51.920
section—

421
00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:56.920
Well, you see the detail that, uh,
that they go into in this picture here.

422
00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:59.920
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
- It almost looks like a tropical plant or something...

423
00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:01.920
- underwater... thing.
- Yeah. Yes.

424
00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:04.920
- Do you know what a clitoris is?
- Oh, my God.

425
00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:06.920
- Well, don't say, "Oh—"
- Yes, I know what a clitoris is.

426
00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:08.920
Oh, you do. Oh, I see. Yes, you do.
I forgot you've been there and back.

427
00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:10.920
- You know everything—
- I've learned about it in Sex Ed—

428
00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.920
- I really don't need you to talk about clitoris.
- I'm trying to make this painless—

429
00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.880
- You know what? I'm sorry. Okay?
- No-no-no.

430
00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.880
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

431
00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.880
I shouldn't have got hot there.

432
00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:24.880
Well, you know what
I'm going to do, Jim.

433
00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:26.880
I'm going to just
leave these books here...

434
00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.880
for you to, uh, peruse at your, uh—
at your leisure.

435
00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.880
Wait!

436
00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:39.880
Well, safer than a tube sock.

437
00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.890
- Okay, that— That was good.
- Yeah.

438
00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:51.890
- See you at dinner.
- Uh, yeah. I'll see you at dinner.

439
00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:54.890
So, Finch, this is your plan?

440
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:57.850
You know, I don't think girls are
into the whole mini-golf thing.

441
00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:59.850
Kevin, I'm sure that they're not.

442
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:03.850
Actually, there is one small matter that
I need to ask for your cooperation in.

443
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:06.850
- In the spirit of this whole pact, you know?
- Sure, what do you need?

444
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:09.850
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
And tell all the boys the same thing.

445
00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:13.850
Look, I got to go.
Sixteen minutes round-trip.

446
00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:16.850
You know, Finch,
it's— it's senior year.

447
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:19.850
I mean, don't you think it's time you
learned how to take a dump at school?

448
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:22.850
When was the last time you looked
at the facilities in this school?

449
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:31.850
- Excuse me.

450
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:34.850
Uh, that's Paul Finch, right?

451
00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:37.810
- Yeah.
- You've seen him in the locker room, right?

452
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:42.810
- Uh, yeah.
- My friends want to know. Is it true?

453
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:45.810
You know, that he's... equipped.

454
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:49.810
I have no idea. Finch showers
with his bathing suit on.

455
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:51.810
I mean, uh—

456
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:55.810
As a matter of fact, it is true.
The guy's huge!

457
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:58.810
- Does he have a date for the prom yet?
- No, definitely not.

458
00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:00.810
All right. Thanks.

459
00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:04.820
Oh, man!

460
00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:09.820
So I was thinking maybe you could
give me some advice, brother to brother.

461
00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:12.820
I thought you might know a trick
or something to make her—

462
00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.820
- Orgasm?
- Yeah.
- What's good here?

463
00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.780
- Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
- What?

464
00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.780
- How do you do that?
- Hey, never mind that. Listen, pay attention.

465
00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.780
Is that all that you're interested in,
trying to get your girl into bed?

466
00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.780
No, it'd be good to be able to,
you know, return the favour.

467
00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:32.780
Be nice to know she enjoys
things as much as I do.

468
00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.780
See that? That's good. That's what
I wanted to hear. Now, you qualify.

469
00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:39.780
- Qualify for what?
- My man, you've just inherited the Bible.

470
00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.780
It originally started
as a sex manual,

471
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.780
this book that some guys
brought back from Amsterdam.

472
00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.780
And each year it got passed on to one
East student who was worthy.

473
00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:54.780
Now, it's full of all sorts of stuff
that guys have added over the years.

474
00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:02.740
But you have to keep it a secret
and return it at the end of the year.

475
00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:06.740
All right.
So now you know. Good luck.

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:04.710
so keep on it, okay?

490
00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:17.710
Not bad, Chris.

491
00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:19.710
Really?

492
00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:22.710
Thanks, uh, Heather, right?

493
00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:24.670
Yeah.

494
00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:27.670
So, you've got this sort of
Frank Sinatra thing going on.

495
00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:32.670
Right. I feel like I've
discovered this whole new side of me.

496
00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:34.680
I mean, uh,
music is so expressive.

497
00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:38.680
Okay.
I mean, I agree, but...

498
00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:41.680
aren't you supposed to be out,
like, trying to decapitate someone...

499
00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:45.680
- with your lacrosse stick or something?
- Oh, sure. Sure.

500
00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:47.680
You know, I know what
people think. It's like,

501
00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:50.680
"Oz, he's just this
kick-ass lacrosse player."

502
00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:53.680
You know, I also play football,
by the way, but that's, like,

503
00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:57.680
- that's not all that I am, you know?
- Of course, I didn't—

504
00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:01.680
I mean, it really bothers me when
people try to pigeonhole me like that.

505
00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:03.680
You?

506
00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:06.640
You think I don't get that?

507
00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.640
God, it's like just because I don't
get drunk and barf every weekend...

508
00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:13.640
that people say, "Oh, look. There's
this Goody Two-Shoes choirgirl priss."

509
00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:18.640
Yeah. So, like,
what else do you do?

510
00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:21.640
Well, the same things you do,

511
00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:24.640
Like hang out
with friends and stuff.

512
00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.640
- Why? What do you think I do?
- Oh, I—

513
00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:30.640
I just realized that I don't
know anything about you.

514
00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:35.640
- I was interested.
- Oh, well, what do you want to know?

515
00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:38.640
You know, stuff... about you.

516
00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.650
All right.

517
00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:48.600
Mom, I'm home!

518
00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:46.570
Oh, yeah. Oh!

519
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:54.570
- Jim!
- It's not what it looks like.

520
00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:03.580
Well, we'll just tell your
mother that, uh— that, uh—

521
00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:05.580
we ate it all.

522
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.540
Goal by number eight,
Chris Ostreicher.

523
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.500
- Nice game.
- Nice game. Good game.

524
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.500
Hey, what are you doing here?

525
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.500
Just enjoying my first exhilarating
lacrosse experience.

526
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.500
- You kicked butt.
- Oh, thanks.

527
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.500
- Um, Chris—
- Oh, you can call me Oz, if you want.

528
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.500
- Do I have to?
- You can call me Ostreicher.

529
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.510
- What's your middle name?
- Nah, forget it.

530
00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.510
- Come on. I won't tell anyone.
- Well, neither will I.

531
00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:22.510
Okay. Um.

532
00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.510
So, I had this thought and—

533
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:28.510
It may seem like
it's way out of left field.

534
00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:32.510
I don't know if you can, but since
I'm not going with anybody, I thought that maybe—

535
00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:35.470
Those guys sucked ass!

536
00:34:35.970 --> 00:34:37.470
Choir chick, what the hell
are you doing here?

537
00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:42.470
Well, uh, I was
asking Chris to prom.

538
00:34:42.970 --> 00:34:44.470
So, do you want to go?

539
00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:48.470
Oh, yeah!
That would be great.

540
00:34:48.970 --> 00:34:51.470
Well, just don't
expect Oz to pay for the limo!

541
00:34:51.970 --> 00:34:54.470
Stifler, fuck!
I mean—

542
00:34:54.970 --> 00:34:59.470
Why do you have to be so
insensitive all the time?

543
00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:02.470
What?

544
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:06.470
Whatever. Look, uh, don't forget.
My cottage after prom.

545
00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:08.470
On Lake Michigan.

546
00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:11.470
Hey, wait up, you pussies.
Where you going?

547
00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:16.430
Ah, well, I got to—
I got to hit the showers now,

548
00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:20.430
but I think this is going to
be really, really good.

549
00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:24.430
- Yeah. Me too.
- All right.

550
00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:26.430
- Bye.
- Bye. Bye.

551
00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:35.440
- 'Appending Oz!
- Working with the choir chick?

552
00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:39.440
What do you say, fellows? I just dig
those cute little sweaters she wears.

553
00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:43.440
- Nuts you do, you little horn dog.

554
00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:46.440
Yeah!
Yeah, baby!

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:50.440

574
00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:10.370
Hi, I was just looking
at the old family portrait out here.

575
00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:13.370
Well, that was
a fun day wasn't it?

576
00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:15.370
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

577
00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:20.370
Jim, I want to talk
about masturbation.

578
00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:24.330
Now, I just want you to know that
it's-it's a perfectly normal, uh, thing.

579
00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:26.330
And I have
to admit, uh, you know.

580
00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:31.330
I did a fair bit of masturbating
when I was a little younger.

581
00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:35.330
- I, uh— I used to call it
"stroking the salami."

582
00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:38.330
Yeah, you know,
"pounding the old pud."

583
00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:41.330
I never did it
with baked goods.

584
00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:45.330
But you know your Uncle Mort?
He "pinched the one-eyed snake" five, six times a day.

585
00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:49.330
See, it's like, uh,
practice for the big game.

586
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:53.330
You see?
It's like— It's like...

587
00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:55.340
banging a tennis ball
against a brick wall.

588
00:37:56.790 --> 00:38:00.340
Which can be fun.
It can be fun, but it's not a game.

589
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:02.290
- Right. No.
- It's not a game.

590
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:06.300
What you want is you want
a partner to return the ball.

591
00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:10.300
- Do you want a partner?
- Yeah. Yeah-Yeah, I want a partner.

592
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.300
- You do want a partner?
- Oh, I want a partner.

593
00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:16.300
- Want a partner. Good. Good.
- Of course.

594
00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.300
Good.

595
00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:22.300
So, once Hal becomes king,
he has to take on...

596
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.300
the responsibilities of leadership
and turn his back...

597
00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.300
on his old,
drunken friend, Falstaff.

598
00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:32.300
You see, Hal is going through a...
rite of passage, much like you all are.

599
00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:36.300
So make most of the time you've got
left together. You'll miss it later.

600
00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.300
- So, does your tongue cramp up?

601
00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:43.300
- Nah. You get kind of dizzy, though.
- Wow.

602
00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:47.260
That's amazing. She's probably
going to want to do it soon.

603
00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:52.260
- All right. Class dismissed.

604
00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:59.260
Still questing after the Holy Grail,
huh, guys?

605
00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.260
Hey, uh, where's Finch?

606
00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.260
- Oh, he went home to take a shit.

607
00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.260
I don't get it.
I just don't.

608
00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.260
How does a guy like that
get this sudden reputation?

609
00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:15.270
- What reputation?
- Observe.

610
00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:19.270
Ex-Excuse me.
Do you know who Paul Finch is?

611
00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:22.270
Yeah! He's the guy
with the tattoo, right?

612
00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:28.230
- You know, the eagle and the
blazing fire and that stuff.

613
00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:32.230
Well, um, if you guys see him later,
will you tell him Courtney says hi?

614
00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:35.230
Bye.

615
00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:39.230
- Okay. Explain.

616
00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:42.230
I can't. I don't
know how he's doing it.

617
00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:45.230
I, uh— I guess that
just leaves Jim trailing.

618
00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:47.230
- Aw, Jimbo!
- Better sack up, buddy!

619
00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:49.230
Yeah, I know.
I'm working on it, all right?

620
00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:52.230
James?

621
00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:54.230
You are very good
in the world history class, yes?

622
00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:58.230
- Me? Y-Yes. No, uh—

623
00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:01.230
- Yes, I am.
- Perhaps you could help me with my studies.

624
00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:04.230
Uh, yeah. Absolutely.

625
00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:06.230
Tha-Tha-Tha— That would be—
That would be great sometime.

626
00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:10.190
- How about tomorrow?
- Well, I have ballet practice.

627
00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:14.190
Perhaps I could come
by your house afterwards?

628
00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:16.190
I could change
clothes at your place.

629
00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:21.190
Oh. Uh... yeah.

630
00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:25.190
I suppose that
would be okay. Sure.

631
00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:36.200
- Nice car!

632
00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:38.200
- I'm glad you think so.
- You don't like it?

633
00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:42.200
No, I like the car.
By the way, though, about prom?

634
00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:45.200
That was a bad idea.
I'm sorry I invited you.

635
00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:48.200
- What are you talking about?
- Please.

636
00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:52.160
I asked you because I thought you might
actually be worth going with.

637
00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:55.160
But you are just a jock.
No, wait. You're a jerk.

638
00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:58.160
Wait!
I don't understand.

639
00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:02.160
I saw you making fun of me
with your lacrosse buddies.

640
00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:04.160
Heather, I wasn't
making fun of you.

641
00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:07.160
Give me a break.
You're so full of it.

642
00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:15.160
Fuck me! There's going to be an Eastern
European chick naked in your house.

643
00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:17.160
And you're not going to
do anything about that?

644
00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:21.160
What am I going to do, huh?
Broadcast her over the Internet?

645
00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:25.160
- Yeah.
- You can do that?

646
00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:32.120
[Scoffs]
No. I cannot do that to her.

647
00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:36.120
Jim, get some fucking balls.

648
00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:40.120
If you don't have the guts
to photograph a naked chick,
how you going to sleep with one?

649
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:43.120
I don't like the kid,

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.540
- Hey, minute man!
- Shut up.

822
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.550
You know— You know you're
supposed to be supportive.

823
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.500
Hey, you think you still
got a chance with Nadia?

824
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.500
No. Her sponsors here
saw the thing on the 'net.

825
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.500
I-I really don't
think they liked it.

826
00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:08.510
How do you know that?

827
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.510
- She's already on a plane back home.

828
00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:12.510
Yeah.

829
00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:16.510
You know, guys? Maybe I'm just
not good with girls, period.

830
00:54:17.010 --> 00:54:19.510
No-no-no, really-really. Like— Like I
was born without that part of the brain.

831
00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:21.510
I mean, I can't talk to girls.

832
00:54:21.970 --> 00:54:23.510
And when I do talk
to them, I screw it up.

833
00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:27.510
Yeah, well, come prom those excuses
aren't going to do you any good.

834
00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:32.510
And one time at band camp,

835
00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:34.510
we weren't supposed
to have pillow fights,

836
00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:38.510
but we had a pillow fight,
and it was so much fun.

837
00:54:38.970 --> 00:54:43.470
A-And this one time,
we all lost our music
and we were supposed to play this song,

838
00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:48.470
but we didn't know it, so we just made
it up and we kept playing and playing,

839
00:54:48.970 --> 00:54:52.470
and the conductor didn't know
what we were doing, and it was so funny.

840
00:54:52.970 --> 00:54:54.470
- So, you're pissed about something, huh.

841
00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:56.470
You know what
I do when I'm angry?

842
00:54:57.970 --> 00:55:00.470
I just play some Bach on my flute.
It's so relaxing.

843
00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:03.470
- I learned to do that at band camp.
- Hold on, uh—

844
00:55:03.930 --> 00:55:06.470
You have no idea why I'm angry?

845
00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:10.470
Is it because we have a test tomorrow?
Sometimes I get cranky...

846
00:55:10.930 --> 00:55:13.480
- when I know I have
a big test to study for.

847
00:55:13.930 --> 00:55:17.480
- Yeah, that's pretty much it.
- I thought so...

848
00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:20.480
- because this one time at band camp—
- W-What's your name?

849
00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:22.480
- Michelle.
- O-Okay.

850
00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:24.430
Michelle, um—

851
00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:27.440
Do you want to be
my date for the prom?

852
00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:31.440
Really? You seriously
want to go with me?

853
00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:37.440
Yes. Seriously.

854
00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:41.440
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party
afterwards? Because that would be so cool.

855
00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:46.440
- Sure, whatever you want.
- Cool! We're going to have such a good time.

856
00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:52.440
It'll be like this one time at band camp
when we all had a campfire—

857
00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:09.400
Hi.

858
00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:13.400
- How'd you know I was here?
- Stifler told me.

859
00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:17.400
- Talked to Stifler?
- Well, I needed to find you.

860
00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:19.400
We're going to have
to work on that song.

861
00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:23.400
Okay.
I'm glad you came by.

862
00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:25.400
So you work nights?

863
00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:30.400
- My dad's the manager.
- Really?

864
00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:33.410
Cool. Tell him
the subs are great.

865
00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:38.410
- So you're going to Michigan next year?
- Yeah.

866
00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:41.410
My parents want me to go
to Northwestern, but...

867
00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:44.410
I don't want to write all those
extra essays they make you do.

868
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:50.370
I mean, how am I supposed to know
what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?

869
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:55.370
So when my UofM acceptance came in
December, I just said the hell with it.

870
00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:57.370
- Onions?
- What?

871
00:56:57.870 --> 00:56:59.370
You, uh, want onions?

872
00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:01.370
Oh, no, thank you.

873
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:07.370
So what are you
going to major in?

874
00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:11.370
State's got a good business school,
and I could probably walk-on to the lacrosse team.

875
00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:15.370
Well, you've probably got it
pretty figured out, then, huh?

876
00:57:15.830 --> 00:57:19.370
I mean, business is okay,
and lacrosse is awesome, but...

877
00:57:19.830 --> 00:57:22.370
what am I going to be,
a professional lacrosse player?

878
00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:24.370
I really have no idea.

879
00:57:24.830 --> 00:57:27.370
Thank God.
I thought I was the only one.

880
00:57:27.830 --> 00:57:29.330
Well, you're not.

881
00:57:31.830 --> 00:57:33.330
So we're going to be
close next year.

882
00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:43.330
You mean East Lansing
and Ann Arbor?

883
00:57:43.830 --> 00:57:46.330
Yeah.

884
00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:48.340
What are you talking about?

885
00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:52.340
I can't go to the prom with you.
I'm holding out for someone else.

886
00:57:52.790 --> 00:57:54.340
You got to be fucking kidding me.

887
00:57:54.790 --> 00:57:59.340
I know it's a long shot, but I figure
Paul Finch might ask me.

888
00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:03.340
Finch.
shit-brick.

889
00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:06.340
Oh, gosh.
I-I forgot.

890
00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:08.340
You look okay.

891
00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:12.300
I-I mean, the scars
healed really well.

892
00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:14.300
- Hey, Stifler.
- Eat shit.

893
00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:18.300
What was that all about?

894
00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:23.300
- He's still embarrassed
because Finch kicked his ass.
- Who told you that?

895
00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:25.300
What do you mean, "no comment"?

896
00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:28.300
- Did you two hook up or something?
- What, are you kidding? No.

897
00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:32.300
Then how did all this
get started?

898
00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:35.300
Well, I guess it's all right
for me to tell you now.

899
00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:39.300
That reputation of his isn't
going anywhere. Cheese, please.

900
00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:42.300
Finch comes up to me
and says, "Jessica,

901
00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:44.300
I need your help with this,
blah, blah, etcetera."

902
00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:47.300
So I said, "All right.
Pay me 200 bucks,

903
00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:50.300
and I'll tell a couple of girls
that you're dynamite in bed."

904
00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:52.260
So he did, and I did.

905
00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:55.260
- That actually works?
- Well, duh! Of course.

906
00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:57.260
Naturally, I embellished
a little bit.

907
00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:00.260
Did you hear that Finch had
an affair with an older woman?

908
00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:02.270
No, I didn't hear that one.

909
00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:04.260
That one was my favourite.

910
00:59:05.770 --> 00:59:07.270
Do that cheerleader.

911
00:59:07.770 --> 00:59:10.270
- ♪ Thank you, baby ♪
- She wants me. She calls me up—

912
00:59:10.770 --> 00:59:15.270
♪ How sweet it is
to be loved by you ♫

913
00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:18.270
Oh, my God, you're gay!

914
00:59:18.730 --> 00:59:20.270
Sing it with me.
You know the words.

915
00:59:20.730 --> 00:59:23.270
No, thanks, man. You've been
singing that shit all week.

916
00:59:23.730 --> 00:59:27.270
If you try that at M.S.U.
this Saturday, I'll kick your ass.

917
00:59:27.730 --> 00:59:29.270
Our last game is this Saturday.

918
00:59:29.730 --> 00:59:31.270
Yeah, well, shit.

919
00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:38.230
I've got this lacrosse game. It's
really important. It's our last game.

920
00:59:38.730 --> 00:59:42.230
Central almost beat us last time, so
this time I really want to kick their ass.

921
00:59:42.730 --> 00:59:45.230
But it's going to be cool,
because the game's at State,

922
00:59:45.730 --> 00:59:48.230
which means afterwards
I'll be able to stop by.

923
00:59:48.730 --> 00:59:50.230
So you can't sing
at the competition.

924
00:59:50.730 --> 00:59:52.230
Heather, I'm sorry.
I totally blew it.

925
00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:57.230
It's okay. You should...
do what makes you happy.

926
00:59:59.690 --> 01:00:03.230
All right. Listen,
thanks for understanding.

927
01:00:03.690 --> 01:00:05.230
Yeah.

928
01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:08.230
So, uh, I guess
I'll see you later?

929
01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:11.230
Mm-hmm.

930
01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:26.200
Hey, Kevin.

931
01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:31.200
- You seen shit-brick lately?
- Why? What did you do to him?

932
01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:33.200
Me? Nothing.

933
01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:36.200
See, I'm the one
whose ass he kicked.

934
01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:39.200
But, uh, I'll tell you
one thing, though.

935
01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:43.200
I don't think he's going to have a problem
shitting in school anymore.

936
01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:45.200
Slipped a little something
into his mochaccino.

937
01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:50.200
Oh, God!

938
01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:53.200
Oh! Oh!

939
01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:01.160
Jesus.

940
01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:04.160
Right this way, sir.

941
01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:13.160
Oh, God.

942
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:44.130
- Oh, no.

943
01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:47.130
It's going to be fun.

944
01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:49.130
You know it's just going to be
some crappy band and stupid decorations.

945
01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:53.130
You're just saying that because
prom's a week away and you don't have a date.

946
01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:56.130
No, no, no.
I don't want a date.

947
01:01:56.630 --> 01:02:00.130
- Finch is going stag and...
so am I.

948
01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:04.130
God, he's like so... refined.

949
01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:07.130
- You think that older woman
thing is true?

950
01:02:07.590 --> 01:02:10.130
Yeah, it's true.
It was Stifler's mom.

951
01:02:12.590 --> 01:02:16.130
- Joanie, was that you?

952
01:02:16.590 --> 01:02:18.130
- Oh!
- Can't hold it.

953
01:02:18.590 --> 01:02:21.090
Oh!

954
01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:54.100
- Yeah!

955
01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:57.100
Kev?
I think we've come...

956
01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:01.060
- a really long way since homecoming.
- Yeah, we have.

957
01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.060
Maybe it's time...

958
01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:07.060
we start to express ourselves
in new ways.

959
01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:09.060
- Yeah.
- You want to do it?

960
01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:12.060
- Yeah.
- I love you.

961
01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:16.060
It's your turn.

962
01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:20.060
That's not
what I was thinking.

963
01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:24.060
Sex. It's always about sex.

964
01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:27.060
It's not always about sex.

965
01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:30.060
I just thought it was
about sex this time.

966
01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:38.060
Look, Vicky, love is a term
that gets thrown around,

967
01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.060
and-and people don't mean it.

968
01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:43.020
When I say it, I want it
to be more than words.

969
01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:46.020
- You know? I want it to be—
- Perfect.

970
01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:50.020

01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:30.990
- Let the music be my guide.
- That would be a start.

982
01:04:42.490 --> 01:04:43.990
Who's the man?
Stifler!

983
01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:48.990
Huddle up, guys! Huddle up!

984
01:04:57.450 --> 01:05:00.990
Huddle up!
Come on! Okay.

985
01:05:01.450 --> 01:05:02.990
All right, all right!

986
01:05:03.450 --> 01:05:04.990
- Good hustle, guys.
- Good hustle.

987
01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:09.950
But you can still lose. You all saw
what happened to Oz out there.

988
01:05:10.450 --> 01:05:14.960
I don't want to ever see any of you
thinking you're going to score.

989
01:05:15.450 --> 01:05:17.960
You don't score until you score.

990
01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:20.960
- Until you score.
- That's right, baby!

991
01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:22.960
It all boils down to today.

992
01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:26.960
For you seniors,
this marks the culmination...

993
01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:29.960
- of the past four years.
- Culmination.

994
01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:34.960
I want you to think about
what this means to you.

995
01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:37.960
Do you guys want to look back
on your days at East...

996
01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:41.960
and know that you used
the time you had?

997
01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:44.960
- Hell, yeah!
- You do!

998
01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:49.920
- Ah! Good attitude, Ostreicher.
- Good luck, fellows.

999
01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:53.920
Christ, I didn't tell you
to leave the game.

1000
01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:55.920
I'm sorry, Coach.

1001
01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:58.920
You got someplace more important
to be, Ostreicher?

1002
01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:00.920
Yeah.

1003
01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:02.920
Ostreicher!

1004
01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:07.920
Oz?
Fuckface?

1005
01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:10.920
Ostreicher!

1006
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:37.890
- Hey, Oz!
- Ozmeister!

1007
01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:40.890
- Oh, great.
- What about the game?

1008
01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:43.890
- I'm not playing.
- You're missing the game for us?

1009
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:46.890
No, I'm missing the game for you.

1010
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:53.890
- D-Does this mean I'm not
going to get to do the duet?
- Albert, you suck.

1011
01:06:59.350 --> 01:07:00.890

aren't that important.

1025

It's like, I know he
really cares about me, you know?

1026
01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:56.820
Even if he can't say it, he does.

1027
01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:00.820
And yeah, he always talks about sex, but
that's okay, 'cause he's a guy, right?

1028
01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:03.820
- He's got a dick. He's a guy.
- Right.

1029
01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:05.820
Wait. Is this translation right?

1030
01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:08.820
"Go home, bird teacher.
I've had enough."

1031
01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:11.820
I don't know.
I got it from Kevin.

1032
01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:15.820
- So, does it hurt?
- What?

1033
01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:18.820
You know— sex.
Does it hurt?

1034
01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:22.820
Yeah. I mean, the first time
you do it, you know, it hurts.

1035
01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:26.820
But then you, you do it again
and again and again—

1036
01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:30.820
It just starts to feel good.
Really good.

1037
01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:33.820
Okay, so say I don't do it.

1038
01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:38.780
And then I go off to college. I might
end up doing it with some random guy...

1039
01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:41.780
- who totally turns out to be a jerk.
- This is true.

1040
01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:44.780
And I'll wish I would've
done it with Kevin.

1041
01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:46.780
So go do it with Kevin.

1042
01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:50.780
- You think?
- Yeah. You're— You're ready.

1043
01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:54.790
- You're woman. Look at you.
You're ready for sex.
- You're right.

1044
01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:56.790

I'm going to have sex.

Are you afraid or something?

No. Come on.

Have to what, Kev, huh?
I don't have to do shit.

1104
01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:08.580
Forget it already. I am so sick
and tired of all this bullshit pressure.

1105
01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:12.580
I've never even had sex, and already,
I can't stand it. I hate sex!

1106
01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:16.580
And I'm not going to stand around here
busting my balls over something that,

1107
01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:18.580
quite frankly,
isn't that damn important.

1108
01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:20.580
I'm going to go hang out
with that geek over there...

1109
01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:23.580
'cause at least she has something else
to talk about besides sex.

1110
01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:25.540
Goddamn.

1111
01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:30.540
Yeah.

1112
01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:33.540

how to shit in school, buddy.

1113
01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:36.540
Hey, Finch.

1114
01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.540

1119

Jessica, this is great!
Wow!

1120
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.550
- Felt sort of guilty

1121
01:14:05.010 --> 01:14:07.510
No, I spent 50 on the flask,
150 on the earrings.

1122
01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:11.510
- These are, uh—
- Let me just clarify...

1123
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:16.510
- that you have no chance
of scoring with me, Finch.
- Of course not!

1124
01:14:17.010 --> 01:14:18.510
So I take it you and Sherman
are pretty close, huh?

1125
01:14:20.010 --> 01:14:21.510
You met at that party
a while back, right?

1126
01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:23.510
Yeah, we were
up all night together.

1127
01:14:24.010 --> 01:14:26.510
We had one of those
amazingly deep conversations...

1128
01:14:27.010 --> 01:14:29.510
where you feel like
you really get to know someone.

1129
01:14:29.970 --> 01:14:32.510
Deep conversation, huh?

1130
01:14:32.970 --> 01:14:34.510
Is that what you call it?

1131
01:14:35.970 --> 01:14:37.510
What else would I call it?

1132
01:14:43.970 --> 01:14:45.510
Thank you, Great Falls.

1133
01:14:45.970 --> 01:14:48.510
We're going to take a little break.
You are beautiful.

1134
01:14:53.970 --> 01:14:55.470
You suck!

1135
01:14:58.970 --> 01:15:00.470
Excuse me, everyone.

1136
01:15:00.970 --> 01:15:02.470
Sorry to interrupt.

1137
01:15:02.970 --> 01:15:05.470
I just thought
you all should know this.

1138
01:15:05.970 --> 01:15:08.480
Chuck Sherman is a liar.

1139
01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:10.480
I never had sex with him.

1140
01:15:10.930 --> 01:15:14.480
He's never had sex with anyone.
I know this because he told me.

1141
01:15:14.930 --> 01:15:18.480
Once he tried to screw
a grapefruit, but that's all.

1142
01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:22.480
Oh. He also told me that when he gets
nervous, he sometimes wets his pants.

1143
01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:26.480
- Thank you for your time.

1144
01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:42.440
- Guess what?
- Not interested.

1145
01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:46.440
Kevin. Come on, man. The bus
to Stifler's is going to be here soon.

1146
01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:48.440
- I'm not going.
- What?

1147
01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:52.440
Why not?

1148
01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:57.440
Look, things didn't really
turn out how I wanted them to.

1149
01:15:57.900 --> 01:15:59.440
I mean, I don't even
know what I'm doing.

1150
01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:03.440
I-I'm acting like I've got
everything together tonight.

1151
01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:06.440
I know that Vicky's going to
ask me if I love her, and...

1152
01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:08.440
I don't know
what I'm going to say.

1153
01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:10.440
I mean, I'm on the brink.

1154
01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:14.400
I'm just about to do it.
I should be psyched.

1155
01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:18.400
I don't know. Maybe you're right.
Maybe I am just scared.

1156
01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:22.400
Come on, Kev.
Tonight is the night.

1157
01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:26.410
We-We are finally going
to a post-prom party on the lake.

1158
01:16:26.910 --> 01:16:28.410
We have been waiting for this
for four years.

1159
01:16:28.910 --> 01:16:31.410
Why else have we been friends
with Stifler all this time, right?

1160
01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:35.410
We were friends with Stifler?

1161
01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:37.410
Hey, look.

1162
01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:41.410
Sherman didn't even get laid.

1163
01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:43.410
- He didn't?
- No, he pissed himself.

1164
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:46.410
- What?

1165
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:49.410
We'll tell you on the bus.

1166
01:16:49.870 --> 01:16:53.410
I'm going to go inside
and grab my bag.

1167
01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:55.370
My date too, perhaps?

1168
01:16:57.870 --> 01:16:59.370
Stifler's mom
got it in the divorce.

1169
01:16:59.870 --> 01:17:01.370
That reminds me of this one time—

1170
01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:04.370
Hey, can I ask you a question?

1171
01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:07.370
How come you don't have any stories?
I've got lots of them,

1172
01:17:07.870 --> 01:17:09.370
and you don't have any.

1173
01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:12.370
Oh, I've got stories.
Believe me. They're just, uh—

1174
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:15.370
They're just a little
more risqué than tales of band camp.

1175
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:20.370
Are they gross or something?
Like guy stuff? Tell me!

1176
01:17:20.830 --> 01:17:22.370
Okay.
You want a story?

1177
01:17:22.830 --> 01:17:24.370
Here's a story.
Stifler finds this beer—

1178
01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:32.380
This is the nicest room in the house.
- Kev, it's perfect.

1179
01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:46.340
- You guys are going to fuck,
aren't you?

1180
01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:49.340
Fuckers!
Fuckers, fuckers!

1181
01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.340
Fuckers, fuckers, fuckers!

1182
01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:55.340
- Out.
- Aw, come on!

1183
01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:58.340
- Get out.
- Aw, man!

1184
01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:18.300
There's something
I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.

1185
01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.300
What's that?

1186
01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:23.300
It's going to sound
really bad, but, uh,

1187
01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:25.300
I want you to know.

1188
01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:28.300
You see, uh,

1189
01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:33.300
I'm a virgin, and, uh—

1190
01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:35.300
Well, me, Kevin, Jim
and Finch were—

1191
01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:38.300
We all made this pact...

1192
01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:41.300
that we would
lose our virginity...

1193
01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:43.300
before high school was over,

1194
01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:46.300
and tonight is supposed
to be the night that we all do it.

1195
01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:50.310
This isn't the best way
to proposition me.

1196
01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:53.310
No, that's—
That's not what I mean.

1197
01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:56.310
W-What I mean is, uh—

1198
01:18:57.770 --> 01:18:59.270
Look, do you know
what made me leave that game?

1199
01:18:59.770 --> 01:19:03.270
See, Coach, he was giving us
this speech about...

1200
01:19:03.770 --> 01:19:06.270
not slacking off when you see
the opportunity to score—

1201
01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:08.270
This isn't any better, Chris.

1202
01:19:08.770 --> 01:19:10.270
No, you see—
You see, Heather,

1203
01:19:11.770 --> 01:19:13.270
what I realized is that...

1204
01:19:13.770 --> 01:19:18.270
with you, it's...
not like I'm running towards a goal...

1205
01:19:18.770 --> 01:19:21.270
Looking for
the best way to score.

1206
01:19:21.730 --> 01:19:25.270
This may sound
a little corny, but...

1207
01:19:25.730 --> 01:19:27.270
I feel like I've already won.

1208
01:19:30.730 --> 01:19:34.270
And, uh, I care about you a lot.

1209
01:19:35.730 --> 01:19:38.270
Oz, I know.

1210
01:19:39.730 --> 01:19:42.230
- You called me Oz.
- Well, yeah.

1211
01:19:42.730 --> 01:19:44.230
It's what your friends call you.

1212
01:19:44.730 --> 01:19:47.230
I mean, I feel like I'm
one of your friends now.

1213
01:19:47.730 --> 01:19:51.230
And... your girlfriend?

1214
01:19:53.730 --> 01:19:58.230
♪ Ain't never thought that
I could love like this ♪

1215
01:19:58.730 --> 01:20:01.240
♪ This feeling inside me
is growing ♪

1216
01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:06.240
♪ I never thought that
you would care ♫

1217
01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:27.200
Are you lost?

1218
01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:34.200
You're Stifler's mom.
Uh—

1219
01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:37.200
No, no, not lost.
Just, um,

1220
01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:39.200
you know, taking the tour.

1221
01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:46.200
Hey, uh, thank you for letting
us have this wonderful party.

1222
01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:48.200
As if there was
an alternative in the matter.

1223
01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:56.200
So, you enjoying yourself?

1224
01:20:56.660 --> 01:20:59.200
I'm... three sheets
to the wind, ma'am.

1225
01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:02.200
I'm so happy for you.

1226
01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:04.160
But it takes the edge off,
doesn't it?

1227
01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:09.160
- Where's your little date tonight?
- No date. It was—

1228
01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:11.160
It was a bathroom incident.

1229
01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:16.160
- Pardon me?
- Never mind.

1230
01:21:20.670 --> 01:21:22.160
You have anything to drink?

1231
01:21:22.670 --> 01:21:24.170
I believe the kegs are upstairs.

1232
01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:28.170
That is what the cretins drink.

1233
01:21:28.630 --> 01:21:30.170
I'm talking about alcohol, liquor.

1234
01:21:30.630 --> 01:21:33.170
- The good stuff.
- All right.

1235
01:21:35.630 --> 01:21:37.170
I got some scotch.

1236
01:21:37.630 --> 01:21:42.170
- Single malt?
- Aged 18 years.

1237
01:21:42.630 --> 01:21:44.170
The way I like it.

1238
01:21:47.630 --> 01:21:50.130
Why don't you go
grab a glass from the bar?

1239
01:21:52.630 --> 01:21:55.130
I think I should.

1240
01:21:55.630 --> 01:21:57.130
Allow me.

1241
01:21:58.630 --> 01:22:00.130
You know it's a bitching party.

1242
01:22:00.630 --> 01:22:03.130
The Stif-man
always comes through in the clutch.

1243
01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:10.130
And then he just
puked his brains out.

1244
01:22:10.590 --> 01:22:13.130
- That is a nasty story.
- Yep, I told you.

1245
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:15.130
Do you want to hear
a nasty story of mine?

1246
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:17.130
It's sort of sexual.

1247
01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:22.130
Yeah!
Yeah, let's hear it.

1248
01:22:22.590 --> 01:22:27.090
Okay, well, this one time at band camp,
we were playing this game.

1249
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:30.090
I don't know if you know it,
but it's called "Spin the Bottle."

1250
01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:34.090
And I had to kiss this guy
named Mark Wander on the lips.

1251
01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:36.100
And-And he plays trombone—

1252
01:22:36.590 --> 01:22:39.100
So how do you want to be?

1253
01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:42.100
Like... how do you want to do it?

1254
01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:46.100
I don't know.
How do you?

1255
01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:51.100
Like... normal style.
The missionary position.

1256
01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:54.100
Okay.

1257
01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:03.100
Kev?

1258
01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:05.100
- Yeah?
- I want to hear you say it.

1259
01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:07.100
Okay.

1260
01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:13.060
Victoria,

1261
01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:15.060
I love you.

1262
01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:19.060

So the end of the story is you...

1282
01:24:27.490 --> 01:24:29.030
had to kiss the guy
for 20 seconds.

1283
01:24:29.490 --> 01:24:32.990
Yes! And he was such a dork.
Everyone laughed at me...

1284
01:24:33.490 --> 01:24:36.990
- but I didn't care
because it was so funny.
- I get it.

1285
01:24:37.490 --> 01:24:40.990
And this one time at band camp,
I stuck a flute in my pussy.

1286
01:24:41.490 --> 01:24:42.990
Hmm.

1287
01:24:43.490 --> 01:24:44.990
Excuse me?

1288
01:24:45.490 --> 01:24:47.990
What? You don't think I know
how to get myself off?

1289
01:24:48.490 --> 01:24:51.990
Hell, that's what
half of band camp is— Sex Ed.

1290
01:24:52.490 --> 01:24:54.990
So are we going to screw soon,
'cause I'm getting kind of antsy.

1291
01:25:04.450 --> 01:25:06.000
This'll do. Whoo-hoo!

1292
01:25:08.450 --> 01:25:12.000
Ow!

1293
01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:13.960
Now, I have two rubbers.
Wear them both. It'll desensitize you.

1294
01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:16.960
Now, I have two rubbers.
Wear them both. It'll desensitize you.

1295
01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:18.960
I don't want you coming
so damn early this time.

1296
01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:23.960
What makes you think
that I would come early?

1297
01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:27.960
Come on. I saw you on the 'net.
Why do you think I accepted this date?

1298
01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:30.960
- You're a sure thing.

1299
01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:35.960
Yes, I am.

1300
01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:39.960
So I said, "This is very obviously
a Piero della Francesca."

1301
01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:42.960
Hmm.

1302
01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:52.960
So, uh, would you object if I said
that you were quite striking?

1303
01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:57.920
Mr. Finch, are you
trying to seduce me?

Yeah.

1333
01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:58.860
I mean, I just can't believe
we had our senior prom.

1334
01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:02.820
I know.
It went by so fast.

1335
01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:05.820
Yeah, it did.

1336
01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:07.820
Kevin?

1337
01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:14.820
Next year with you
going to Ann Arbor...

1338
01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:17.820
and me going to Ithaca,

1339
01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:21.820
it's not going to work, is it?

1340
01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:23.820
No.
Don't say that.

1341
01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:25.820
I mean, we could make it work.

1342
01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:29.820
- It'll be perfect.
- No, Kevin.

1343
01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:33.820
- But—
- See, that's what I've been realizing...

1344
01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:36.820
is that... nothing's perfect.

1345
01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:41.780
And you can't plan everything.

1346
01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:45.780
Well, I guess...
you will be pretty far away.

1347
01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:49.790
And we'll be on our own,
meeting new people.

1348
01:28:54.290 --> 01:28:55.790
Last night, though.

1349

1351
01:29:22.250 --> 01:29:24.750
She's gone.
Wha—

1352
01:29:25.250 --> 01:29:26.750
Oh, my God.
She used me.

1353
01:29:28.250 --> 01:29:28.750
I was used.

1354
01:29:31.250 --> 01:29:34.750
