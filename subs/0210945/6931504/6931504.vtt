00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.420
<i>In Virginia,</i>

2
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.780
<i>high school football
is a way of life.</i>

3
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.860
<i>It's bigger than Christmas day.</i>

4
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.180
<i>My daddy coached in Alexandria.</i>

5
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.740
<i>He worked so hard,
my mama left him,</i>

6
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.180
<i>but I stayed with Coach.</i>

7
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.580
<i>He needed me on that field.</i>

8
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.900
<i>Up until 1971 in Alexandria,</i>

9
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.100
<i>there was no race mixing.</i>

10
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.180
<i>Then the school board
forced us to integrate.</i>

11
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.060
<i>They combined the white school
and the black school into one</i>

12
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.940
<i>called
T.C. Williams High School.</i>

13
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.940
Murderer! Murderer!

14
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.660
<i>That summer
a black teenager was killed</i>

15
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.660
<i>by a white store owner,</i>

16
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.180
<i>and the city was
on the verge of exploding.</i>

<i>♪ Well, my mind

18

<i>Blue left!
Blue left! Left!</i>

21
00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.580
Come on, Kurt, don't let Ray
back you down like that!

22
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.500
You're twice his size!

23
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.820
What are they doing?

24
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.180
If they keep playing like that,
we'll lose every game!

25
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.860
I didn't think that was so bad.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.100
Looks good, Gerry.
I can see you been working.

28
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.860
Thanks.
Thanks a lot, Coach.

29
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.740
Listen, with the schools
integrating and all,

30
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.116
some of the guys are
worried about losing

31
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.380
their starting positions.

32
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.780
Well, that's something we're
just gonna have to figure out,

33
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.260
but you don't worry
about that now.

34
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.780
You just keep at it.
All right?

35
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.060
Yes, Coach.

36
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.260
<i>Hey, guys! Guys!</i>

37
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.980
<i>It's comin' down!</i>

38
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.100
It's comin' down at the store!

39
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.276
They want to burn the place up

40
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.020
'cause that colored kid
got shot.

41
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.580
Come on, man, let's go.

42
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.140
Coach?

43
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.260
You just get Sheryl

49
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.140
You boys are gonna cool off,

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.700
help me finish
packing my things.

51
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.820
Gerry, son, your heart's
in the right place,

52
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.916
but you ought to know better

53
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.316
than to embarrass
the coach like that.

54
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.156
Hell, why don't you just
kick them all off the team?

55
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.260
I don't want to play with
any of those black animals.

56
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.540
<i>I see him.</i>

57
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.100
Who are you?

58
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.300
I'm Herman Boone. I'm
the new assistant coach.

59
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.020
<i>Well, from the looks of things,</i>

60
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.340
<i>I'd say we got all the help
we need around here.</i>

61
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.780
Why ain't you outside there

62
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.220
with all your
little friends, hollerin'?

63
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.620
This was the time that
was arranged for me

64
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.020
to meet with Coach Yoast.

65
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.940
I never miss an appointment.

66
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.260
Well, maybe you just
better reschedule.

67
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.156
Coach Boone, the school
board made the decision

68
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.860
to put you on my staff.
I did not hire you.

69
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.980
Well, I came up here
to coach at G.W.

70
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.220
I didn't ask the schools
to redistrict.

71
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.980
I didn't ask to be
assigned to your staff,

72
00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.460
so I guess we're both
in a situation

73
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.540
we don't want to be in.

74
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.900
But I can guarantee
you this, Coach,

75
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.100
I come to win.

76
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.100
<i>Win? Coach Yoast
here has been nominated</i>

77
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.500
<i>to the Virginia
High School Hall of Fame.</i>

78
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.860
<i>15 winning seasons.</i>

79
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.580
I won a couple of titles
down in North Carolina.

80
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.100
That's double "A" ball.

81
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.940
This here's Virginia.
We play triple "A."

82
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.220
What an opportunity
for me then...

83
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.500
to learn...
from the best.

84
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.580
<i>♪ Ooh, I bet
you're wonderin' how I knew ♪</i>

85
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.540
Are those people the movers?

86
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.020
No. Looks like
they're moving in here.

87
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.180
How many of them are there?

88
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.780
It only takes one.

89
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.220
Then we're gonna be
overrun by 'em.

90
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.220
<i>Mommy, where are you
taking my teddy bear?</i>

91
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.500
That. Come on, y'all.
Ohh.

92
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.540
Where is everybody?

93
00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.500
Nicky, yes.

94
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.220
<i>Look there, here
comes some more of 'em.</i>

95
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.460
<i>That's Dr. Day, that
Negro from the school board.</i>

96
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.260
<i>What's he doing here?</i>

97
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.540
<i>The school board has decided
that Negro Herman Boone</i>

98
00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.940
is gonna be
the head coach at T.C.

99
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.460
It's not fair!
My daddy's head coach!

100
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.300
<i>This is gonna be
his Hall of Fame year!</i>

101
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.820
<i>No one is trying to take away</i>

102
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.780
your daddy's future
place in the hall.

103
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.620
You can't just walk in here
and take my daddy's job away!

104
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.900
That is enough, Sheryl.
That's enough.

105
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.860
Sheryl!

106
00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.500
It's all right, Bill.
I feel the same way.

107
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.740
It's those agitators
and race-mixers

108
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.700
<i>I feel like taking a swat at.</i>

109
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.220
<i>Troublemakers in
the Berg are ready</i>

110
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.380
<i>to put a torch to the city.</i>

111
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.100
You want us to burn up
like Watts?

112
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.740
Every head coach in
the system is white.

113
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.500
We had to give them something.

114
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.260
It's the world we live in,
God help us all.

115
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.340
I left North Carolina
because I was passed over

116
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.420
for a job that I had
rightfully earned.

117
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.260
Gave it to a white coach
down there

118
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.140
couldn't even tie up
his own football cleats.

119
00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.700
Now you are asking me

120
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.820
<i>to do the same thing
to this man?</i>

121
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.100
I can't do that.

122
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.380
<i>Herman?</i>

123
00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.100
Folks in Carolina say
you marched with Dr. King.

124
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.540
Say you stood toe-to-toe
with the Klan.

125
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.980
Said you're a race man.

126
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.980
That's right.
I'm also a family man.

127
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.780
Coach Boone, black folks
have never had

128
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.780
anything in this city
to call their own

129
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.980
except humiliation and despair.

130
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.460
Dr. Day, excuse me.

131
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.620
Herman, I think you'd
better look outside.

132
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.100
So, you see,
we need you, Coach Boone.

133
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.140
Come on, meet the people.

134
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.140
Coach Boone,
I'm Charles Campbell.

135
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.580
This here is my boy Julius.

136
00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.220
He can be the finest
defensive end

137
00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.620
in the whole state
if you push him to it.

138
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.900
I've heard a lot about you.

139
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.500
You're like an answer
to our prayers.

140
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.516
Now, wait a minute. I'm not
an answer to your prayers.

141
00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.460
I'm not a savior
or Jesus Christ,

142
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.140
Martin Luther King,
or the Easter bunny.

143
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.220
I'm a football coach,
that's all.

144
00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.540
Just a football coach.

145
00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:14.740
You're <i>our</i> coach.

146
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.260
You're <i>our</i> coach!

147
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.940
Coach Boone!

148
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:27.380
<i>Boone! Boone! Boone!</i>

149
00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.620
What do you want?

150
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.100
Is Coach Yoast here?

151
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.180
<i>We're busy...</i>

152
00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.860
interviewing
for head coaching jobs.

153
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.500
Gotten 11 offers and
certainly no time for you.

154
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.500
Well, come on in.
I've got an office out back.

155
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.980
<i>Look, I can't
even spell diplomacy,</i>

156
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.220
<i>and I'm sorry about
the way things went down,</i>

157
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.260
<i>but make no mistake,
I am qualified</i>

158
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.396
to be this school's head coach.

159
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.820
Sure. You've been in,
what,

160
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.780
4 or 5 programs
in the past 10 years?

161
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.420
<i>With 4 or 5 championships.</i>

162
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.820
<i>This isn't about me.</i>

163
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.220
I'm worried about my boys.

164
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.300
<i>Well, I ain't gonna
cook 'em and eat 'em.</i>

165
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.980
The best player will play.
Color won't matter.

166
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.580
<i>From the looks of our
little situation we got here,</i>

167
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.580
I'd say it's about
all that does.

168
00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:34.300
Yeah, you're right.

169
00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.780
<i>We're in a tough spot, Coach,</i>

170
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.420
you, me, the whole city.

171
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.740
I think it would go a long
way to smooth things over

172
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.020
if you would stay,
work on the staff,

173
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.700
be a defensive coordinator,
assistant head coach.

174
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.660
Work under you?

175
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.540
If that's the way you see it.

176
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.700
Good night, Coach.

177
00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.740
<i>It's been a rare privilege</i>

178
00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.820
<i>to have lived here
as long as I have</i>

179
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.060
coaching your boys.

180
00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.340
I'll be taking the year off...

181
00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.700
<i>No.</i>

182
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.020
After which
I'll be moving to Loudon

183
00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.340
and taking the head coaching
job at Loudon High.

184
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.340
- I say boycott T.C. Williams!
- Tell 'em, Fred!

185
00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.780
Our boys aren't playing
for some "Coach Coon!"

186
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.860
Coach, he stole your job.

187
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.660
<i>I'm not playing for him.</i>

188
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.900
I started a petition, and I'm
sitting this season out.

189
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:29.380
<i>Only place you're going to sit</i>

190
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.980
is back in that chair, Gerry.

191
00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.500
I appreciate it, though.

192
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.060
<i>Boycott T.C.!
Boycott the school!</i>

193
00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.820
Stop this, Fred.
You know none of these boys

194
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.740
can afford to go
to some other district

195
00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:40.820
just to play ball.

196
00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.420
They sit this one out,

197
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.020
they put their futures
on the line.

198
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.100
Coach, I'm out, too.

199
00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.340
<i>I'm not playing for no thief.</i>

200
00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:48.820
Don't do this.

201
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.140
Don't make this any harder
for me than it already is.

202
00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.820
Coach, if you go, I go.

203
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.020
<i>I only play
for you, Coach Yoast.</i>

204
00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.460
<i>Don't go, Coach.
You can't leave us.</i>

205
00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.500
Coach Yoast!
Coach Yoast! Coach Yoast!

206
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.620
We'll be all right, Coach.

207
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.060
I've coached most of these boys

208
00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.460
since they were your age.

209
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.076
I've seen them grow up
in front of my eyes,

210
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.540
almost like
they were my own kids.

211
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:17.740
Almost.

212
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.940
This is a heck of a time
to be abandoning them

213
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.420
to look out for
themselves, ain't it?

214
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.700
So... what are you
gonna do?

215
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.220
<i>We gonna play some ball, y'all!</i>

216
00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.700
Black inside, black inside,
black inside.

217
00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.340
<i>Yo, Petey,
how many yards you figure</i>

218
00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:38.740
you gonna get this season, bro?

219
00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.820
You know, I ain't one
to brag, big Blue,

220
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.860
but I figure on
at least a thousand.

221
00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:44.900
<i>But I ain't one to brag.</i>

222
00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.420
Didn't I tell you
all them white boys

223
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.780
weren't gonna play
for no brother?

224
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.220
Well, who needs 'em, baby?

225
00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.740
From now on the Titans gonna be
powered by soul power, bro.

226
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:56.900
♪ He said soul power ♪

227
00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.260
Shut up.

228
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:13.500
Put your hand down.

229
00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:14.500
You're smiling.

230
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:15.500
Yes.

231
00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.860
Yes, sir.
Why are you smiling?

232
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.940
'Cause I love football.
Football's fun.

233
00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:22.980
Fun, sir. It's fun?

234
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:23.980
- Yes.
- You sure?

235
00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:24.980
I think...

236
00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.060
Now you're thinkin'.

237
00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.740
First you smile,
then you thinkin'.

238
00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.300
You think football is still fun?

239
00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:30.380
Uh, yes.

240
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.380
Sir.

241
00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.380
- Yes... no, sir.
- No?

242
00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.860
It was fun.

243
00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.460
Not anymore, though, is it?

244
00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:37.580
Not right now.

245
00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.380
It's not fun anymore.
Not even a little bit.

246
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:40.940
Uh... no.

247
00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:42.836
Make up your mind.
Think since you're thinking.

248
00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.500
Go on, think.
Is it fun?

249
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.620
- No, sir.
- No?

250
00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:46.620
Absolutely not?

251
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:47.780
Zero fun, sir.

252
00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.780
All right, listen up.
I'm Coach Boone.

253
00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:53.940
I'm gonna tell you all
about how much "fun"

254
00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.140
you're gonna have this season.

255
00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.300
We leave for camp,
Gettysburg College,

256
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.260
August 15th, 7:29 A.M.

257
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.060
<i>If you report at 7:30,</i>

258
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.900
you will not be playing
football this season,

259
00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.420
you will be watching.

260
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.940
You will wear
a jacket, shirt, and tie.

261
00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.420
If you don't have one, buy one.

262
00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.860
Can't afford one,
borrow one from your old man.

263
00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:15.940
If you don't have an old man,

264
00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.820
then find a drunk,
trade him for his.

265
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.756
'Cause I guarantee you
there isn't a bum on the street

266
00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:22.180
<i>that looks as raggedy
and ridiculous</i>

267
00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.700
<i>as what I'm looking at
right now.</i>

268
00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:25.740
<i>This is no democracy.</i>

269
00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.740
It is a dictatorship.

270
00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.260
I am the law.

271
00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:36.020
If you survive camp,
you will be on the team.

272
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.380
If you survive.

273
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:40.660
Check 'em in, Coach.

274
00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.300
Checkin' 'em in.

275
00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.780
I'm Coach Hinds,
your offensive line coach.

276
00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:47.140
Yell out your name and position
starting from the right.

277
00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.900
Petey Jones, running back.

278
00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.700
<i>The</i> running back, y'all.

279
00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:51.780
<i>Whatever, Petey.</i>

280
00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.220
<i>Get outta here!</i>

281
00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:56.940
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Jerry Harris, quarterback.</i>

282
00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:00.020
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah, Rev!

283
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:00.940
Rev?

284
00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.980
It's just a nickname.

285
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:06.020
<i>And who in the name
of heaven might you be?</i>

286
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.780
Louie Lastik, offensive lineman.

287
00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.220
Naval family, just moved
here from Bayonne.

288
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.100
Someone said football,
so I come runnin'.

289
00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:15.420
What's goin' on, everybody?

290
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.300
With him calling the shots,
ain't none of us

291
00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.620
gonna see nothin'
but the bench this year.

292
00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.180
He ain't calling
the shots. You'll play.

293
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.820
<i>You have just disrupted</i>

294
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.420
my first team meeting

295
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.980
in an unacceptable fashion.

296
00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.500
This is my team now.

297
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:49.956
Either you're with that
or you're not.

298
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.940
I'm here, ain't I?
Let's talk football.

299
00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.060
Let's talk football.

300
00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.740
I run the defense...

301
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.940
As a part of my team strategy.

302
00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:59.940
Now, I have never seen
an assistant coach's name

303
00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.740
in the newspaper
for losing a game.

304
00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:03.260
I want a job for Coach Tyrell.

305
00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.740
He's been with me for 10 years.

306
00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.580
I won't leave him
out in the cold.

307
00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.300
You don't get me without him.

308
00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.940
You're overcooking
my grits, Coach.

309
00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:16.820
All right. I will
<i>allow</i> Coach Tyrell

310
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.260
to coach the special team,

311
00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.300
but I will have my eye on him.

312
00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.820
And you.

313
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.156
Good morning, good morning,
Coaches, how are you?

314
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.380
Good morning to you.

315
00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:33.460
Looks good today, doesn't it?

316
00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.820
Just wanted to let you know
what the offense is doing.

317
00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:37.700
Awful skinny playbook, ain't it?

318
00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.780
I run 6 plays, split veer.
It's like novocaine.

319
00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.540
Just give it time, always works.

320
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:44.660
See you on the bus.

321
00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.060
Be patient, Bill.
Your time will come.

322
00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:50.060
Herman, here we go.

323
00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.740
Here we go.

324
00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.300
How can I help you boys?

325
00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:57.820
I'm Gerry Bertier,

326
00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.580
the only all-American
you got on this team.

327
00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:02.860
You want any of us
to play for you,

328
00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.340
<i>you reserve half
the open positions</i>

329
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.660
<i>for Hammond players,</i>

330
00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:07.620
<i>half the offense,
half the special teams.</i>

331
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.620
We don't need any of
your people on defense.

332
00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:10.700
We're already set.

333
00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.140
Uh-huh. Don't need
none of my people?

334
00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.140
What did you say
your name was, Jerry?

335
00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.500
Gerry.

336
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.420
No, you must have said
Jerry, like Lewis,

337
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.220
which would make you
Dean Martin, right?

338
00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.100
Ladies and gentlemen,
I got an announcement to make.

339
00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:28.100
We got Jerry Lewis
and Dean Martin

340
00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:30.020
<i>going to camp with us
here this year.</i>

341
00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.700
<i>Jerry tells the jokes,</i>

342
00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:34.420
Dean sings the songs
and gets the girl.

343
00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.580
Let's give them
a round of applause.

344
00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.940
Where's your folks, Gerry?

345
00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:47.740
Your parents, are they here?

346
00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.020
Where are they?

347
00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:51.460
<i>That's my mother.</i>

348
00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:52.780
<i>That's your mama?</i>

349
00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.660
Very nice.
How are you?

350
00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.220
Take a good look at her.

351
00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:58.660
'Cause once you get on that bus,

352
00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.180
you ain't got no mama no more.

353
00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.660
You got your brothers
on the team,

354
00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.220
and you got your daddy.

355
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.980
Now, you know who
your daddy is, don't you?

356
00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:10.540
Gerry, if you want to play
on this football team,

357
00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:15.740
you answer me when I ask you
who is your daddy.

358
00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.380
Who's your daddy, Gerry?

359
00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.780
Who's your daddy?

360
00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:23.300
You.

361
00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.780
Uh-huh. And whose team
is this?

362
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:30.260
<i>Is this your team,
or is this your daddy's team?</i>

363
00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:31.820
Yours.

364
00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.260
Mm-hmm. Get on the bus.

365
00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:39.340
Put your jacket on first
and get on the bus.

366
00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:40.420
OK.

367
00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.500
<i>Uh, Dean?</i>

368
00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:48.020
Fix that tie, son.

369
00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.460
All right, listen up,
I want everybody off the bus.

370
00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.860
Let's go. Follow me. Everybody.
Let's go right now.

371
00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.140
<i>Why we got to get off the bus?</i>

372
00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.820
<i>What are they doing, man?</i>

373
00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.100
All right,
everybody, off the bus.

374
00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:13.620
Listen up, I don't care

375
00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.820
if you're black, green,
blue, white, or orange,

376
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.500
I want all of my defensive
players on this side,

377
00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.940
all players going out
for offense over here.

378
00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.140
Right now.

379
00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.620
Let's move! Let's move!
Let's move! Let's move!

380
00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.980
You and you, offensive bus.
Sit together.

381
00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.740
You and you, defensive bus.
Sit together.

382
00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:32.300
Get comfortable, too,

383
00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.740
because the person that
I have you sitting next to

384
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.460
is the same one
you'll be rooming with

385
00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:39.540

I don't want to see

<i>♪ When I die ♪</i>

406
00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:51.500

Why don't you look at your wall
and I'll look at mine?

408
00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:54.980
I'll look wherever I want to,

409

and I don't want to be
looking at that for 2 weeks.

410
00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.020
Then you better use your
X-ray vision, Superman,

411
00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.460
and look right through it,
'cause it ain't comin' down.

412
00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.420
Fight!

413
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.220
<i>Fight?</i>

420
00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:25.660
Get off me!

421
00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.140
Bunch of tough guys, huh?

422
00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:32.580
You look like a bunch
of fifth-grade sissies

423
00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.740
<i>after a cat fight.</i>

424
00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.740
You got anger. That's good.

425
00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:38.580
<i>You're gonna need it, son.</i>

426
00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.180
You got aggression.
That's even better.

427
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.460
<i>You're gonna need that, too,</i>

428
00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.900
<i>but any 2-year-old child
can throw a fit.</i>

429
00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:48.740
<i>Football is about
controlling that anger.</i>

430
00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:51.780
Harnessing that aggression
into a team effort

431
00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:54.100
<i>to achieve perfection!</i>

432
00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.620
<i>Some coaches, they cut a player</i>

433
00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.540
if they think
he's not up to snuff.

434
00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.060
When they think
he's hurting the team.

435
00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.060
This is a public school program.

436
00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.460
I will never, ever cut a player

437
00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:07.980
who comes out to play for me,

438
00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.460
but when you put
that uniform on,

439
00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.380
that Titan uniform,
you better come to work.

440
00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:18.260
We will be perfect...

441
00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:19.780
in every aspect of the game.

442
00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.900
<i>You drop a pass, you run a mile.</i>

443
00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.260
<i>You miss a blocking assignment,
you run a mile.</i>

444
00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:25.980
<i>You fumble the football,</i>

445
00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:30.860
<i>and I will break my foot off
in your John Brown hindparts...</i>

446
00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.500
and then you will run a mile.

447
00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.180
Perfection!

448
00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:38.620
Let's go to work.

449
00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.860
<i>Move!
Move those feet!</i>

450
00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.100
Get up, boy! Get up! Get up!

451
00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:49.660
Keep those heads up!

452
00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.820
Keep those feet moving!

453
00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.340
<i>Everything
we gonna do is changing.</i>

454
00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.100
We are change.

455
00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:56.820
We're gonna change
the way we run.

456
00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.260
We're gonna change
the way we eat.

457
00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.716
We're gonna change
the way we block.

458
00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.180
We're gonna change
the way we tackle.

459
00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:04.820
We're gonna change
the way we win.

460
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.020
<i>Defense is desire!</i>

461
00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.100
<i>Fire and desire.</i>

462
00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.860
Defense! Come on!

463
00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:15.820
Get up. Get outta here.
Go run. Go.

464
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:23.980
<i>Keep those legs movin'!
Keep those legs apart!</i>

465
00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.540
<i>Keep movin', keep movin'.</i>

466
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.476
<i>Keep that ball with you till
you get outta the briar patch.</i>

467
00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.900
Show me, son! Show me, 'Bama!

468
00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.140
Show me, 'Bama!

469
00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:33.140
Jump on that ball carrier
like a starving man

470
00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:34.820
on a Christmas ham.

471
00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.220
Hut!

472
00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.060
Fumble! Fumble!

473
00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:42.420
<i>What is wrong with you?</i>

474
00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:43.756
<i>Why are you fumbling
my football?</i>

475
00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:44.980
My blockers were bad.

476
00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:45.980
Your blockers ain't got nothin'

477
00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:47.740
to do with you holding the ball!

478
00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:49.276
Did your blockers
fumble the football,

479
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.860
or did you fumble the football?

480
00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:51.940
I did, sir.

481
00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.396
All right. How many
feet are in a mile?

482
00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:55.220
How many feet are in a mile?

483
00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.500
5,280 feet!

484
00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:01.700
You pick this ball up,
you run every one of them!

485
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.980
You're killing me, Petey!
You're killing me!

486
00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:16.980
What you doing, man?

487
00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.940
Eating lunch.

488
00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.940
I see you eating lunch.

489
00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.940
But why you eating over here?

490
00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:26.420
Why don't you go on over there
and eat with your people?

491
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.900
Man, I don't have any people.

492
00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:30.340
I'm with everybody, Julius.

493
00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.300
<i>He's just
a light-skinned brother.</i>

494
00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.980
Yeah, and I'm
a dark-skinned cracker.

495
00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.980
Come on, Julius, he's
just another blessed child

496
00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.340
in God's loving family.

497
00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.580
Come on, Blue, let me...

498
00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:51.300
<i>Lord, we come
before you today...</i>

499
00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:55.260
<i>and ask you to soften
big Julius Campbell's heart.</i>

500
00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:58.620
Look at that traitor.

501
00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.380
And Rev?
He better be praying

502
00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:03.300
I block for his black behind.

503
00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.300
Yeah, but, Ray,
if you don't block

504
00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:06.980
you're not gonna start.

505
00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:09.300
I'll start.

506
00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:10.660
I'll just bide my time.

507
00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.540
I got some plays we won
the city title with last year.

508
00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.860
Got some trick plays,
some stuff that might

509
00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:20.020
fire up the boys'
imaginations a little bit.

510
00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.980
Trick plays?

511
00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:23.876
<i>I think unless the boys
start having a little fun</i>

512
00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.956
they're not gonna put points
up on that board for you.

513
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.420
<i>You worry about your defense.</i>

514
00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.716
Let me worry about the offense.

515
00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.180
All right.

516
00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.100
Lastik!

517
00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:43.100
I want you to tell me something

518
00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:44.660
about one of your
black teammates.

519
00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:45.940
Sir, yes, sir!

520
00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.380
I'm rooming with Blue, sir,

521
00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:50.300
and I noticed he wears those
leopard-spotted underwears,

522
00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:51.860
bikini-style, sir!

523
00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.860
OK, maybe somebody
who's not your roommate.

524
00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:56.780
Sir, I eat lunch with Rev.

525
00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.700
<i>That's Jerry Harris, sir!</i>

526
00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.620
<i>People call him Rev
'cause he's always praying,</i>

527
00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.900
and he won't abide
a foul tongue, sir!

528
00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:05.860
And what is the Rev gonna
do after high school?

529
00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:07.380
I don't know.

530
00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.700
Go to college
and all that, I guess.

531
00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.316
What about you?
You gonna go to college?

532
00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:12.740
Oh, not me, Coach.

533
00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.300
I ain't a brainiac like Rev.

534
00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:15.860
Think you got a future
in football?

535
00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.980
Heck, no. I just figure
if I got to be in school

536
00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:20.956
I might as well hit some
people while I'm at it.

537
00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:22.740
All right, I like that.

538
00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.460
A self-aware man, I like that.

539
00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.740
But if you don't go to college,

540
00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.900
it's not gonna be because
you're not qualified,

541
00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:30.900
so I want you to bring me
your test scores

542
00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.276
at the end of every week, and
we'll go over them together, OK?

543
00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.180
We'll keep that
between you and me.

544
00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.380
OK.

545
00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:40.140
So, what kind of music
does the Rev like?

546
00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:41.860
<i>Me and Rev both
dig on The Temptations.</i>

547
00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:42.940
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

548
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.060

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:49.060

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.660
Anybody else?

557
00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.300
No volunteers?

558
00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.180
Campbell?

559
00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:17.020
Bertier?

560
00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.660
<i>No, huh?</i>

561
00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:28.300
Each one of you
will spend time every day

562
00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.100
with a teammate of
a different race.

563
00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.740
<i>You will learn
about him and his family,</i>

564
00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:35.300
<i>his likes, his dislikes.</i>

565
00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:38.220
You will report back to me

566
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:41.060
until you meet every one
of your teammates.

567
00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:44.700
Until that time,
we go to 3-a-day practices.

568
00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.220
<i>You continue
to ignore each other,</i>

569
00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.620
<i>we'll go to 4-a-day practices.</i>

570
00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.140
Now, is there any part of this
you don't understand?

571
00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:55.020
Let's see.
What's your daddy's name?

572
00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:57.020
I mean, you do have
a daddy right?

573
00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:00.260
I have a father,
and his name is Eric.

574
00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:02.140
And what's he do?

575
00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:04.420
Wait, he does have a job, right?

576
00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:09.140
♪♪<i>♪ They're gonna</i>
<i>put me in the movies ♪</i>

577
00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:13.540
Huh? Yes! This one.

578
00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:15.940
I don't even have
to ask, but I will.

579
00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:17.420
What do you think of this one?

580
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.420
Does the term "cruel
and unusual punishment"

581
00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.180
mean anything to you?

582
00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.100
2 minutes to go in the game.

583
00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:26.836
The other team is out there,
they're tired.

584
00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:28.500
Fourth quarter.
Fourth quarter.

585
00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.380
Fourth quarter.

586
00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.940
Nobody from my family
ever went to no college.

587
00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.020
I'll tutor you, Louie.

588
00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:35.500
<i>I'm white trash!</i>

589
00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:37.340
I ain't gonna get
no C-plus grades!

590
00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:39.460
I'm just down-home, no-good,

591
00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:42.420
never-goin'-to-no-college
white trash, man!

592
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.996
Would you hurry up
and get off the phone?

593
00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.236
I got to call my girl, too, man!

594
00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:46.500
Say it right now.

595
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:50.300
<i>Oh, oh, don't do this right now.</i>

596
00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:52.580
Hey, man, what is this,
<i>Wild Kingdom?</i>

597
00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:53.700
Shut up, y'all!

598
00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.380
Mating habits of
the mountain gorillas?

599
00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.540
Gerry, you say it, or I'm
not hanging up the phone.

600
00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.860
<i>Say it right now.</i>

601
00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:02.300
I love you, sugar.

602
00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:04.860
Ha ha ha!
"I love you, sugar!"

603
00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:06.020
Left!

604
00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:07.540
<i>Let's go!</i>

605
00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:08.780
<i>Watch it!
Watch it!</i>

606
00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:10.900
<i>Set! Hut!</i>

607
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.300
<i>Get him!
Get him! Get him!</i>

608
00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.140
<i>What are y'all doing?</i>

609
00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.940
44 stack! You're supposed
to know your jobs!

610
00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.460
Campbell, you're playing
selfish, show-off football.

611
00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:24.580
<i>Hold your man down.</i>

612
00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.100
Don't you single me out
like that.

613
00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:27.716
What, you think
I'm stupid or something?

614
00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.140
Listen, I'm the team captain,

615
00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:30.660
and I don't need you
up in my face...

616
00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:33.740
<i>We're here to
play football, y'all.</i>

617
00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:35.140
<i>Let's play football.</i>

618
00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.220
Doc?

619
00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:38.620
I got it.

620
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.380
Y'all didn't come
out here to practice!

621
00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:42.740
'Cause champions pay the price!

622
00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:45.140
Lookin' like a bunch
of bums out here!

623
00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:48.460
<i>Who's a coward?
Cowards won't block.</i>

624
00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.580
<i>Cowards won't tackle.</i>

625
00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:53.260
Cowards won't go after fumbles.

626
00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:54.740
<i>Coach, we need a water break.</i>

627
00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:55.820
<i>We been out here all day.</i>

628
00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:58.900
What did you say?

629
00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:00.500
I said we need a water break.

630
00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.500
You need a water break.

631
00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:05.540
Water is for cowards.
Water makes you weak.

632
00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:07.940
Water is for washing
blood off that uniform,

633
00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:09.940
and you don't get
no blood on my uniform.

634
00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:12.700
Boy, you must be
outside your mind!

635
00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:15.260
<i>We are going to do up-downs</i>

636
00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:18.980
until Blue is no longer
tired and thirsty.

637
00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.300
<i>Coach!</i>

638
00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:39.340
There's a fine line
between tough and crazy,

639
00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:41.420
and you're flirting with it.

640
00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.220
<i>All right, get some water.</i>

641
00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:54.900
<i>I'll take that.</i>

642
00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:56.820
Hey, wait your turn, boy.

643
00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.140
Who you calling a boy, cracker?

644
00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:03.300
Quit it, jerks!

645
00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:06.220
Come on! You're all acting
like a bunch of sissies!

646
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:07.740
<i>Quit it!</i>

647
00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:20.860
All right, man, listen.
I'm Gerry, you're Julius.

648
00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.340
Let's get some particulars

649
00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:23.916
and just get this
over with, all right?

650
00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.460
- Particulars?
- Yeah.

651
00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:26.580
No matter what I tell you,

652
00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.236
you ain't never gonna know
nothing about me.

653
00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:31.300
Listen, I ain't runnin'
any more of these 3-a-days.

654
00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:32.996
What I got to say,
you really don't want to hear

655
00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:36.340
'cause honesty ain't too high
on your people's priority list.

656
00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.300
Honesty?
You want honesty?

657
00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:41.500
All right, <i>honestly,</i>
I think you're nothing.

658
00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:42.940
<i>Nothing but a pure waste</i>

659
00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.740
<i>of God-given talent.</i>

660
00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:46.740
You don't listen to nobody, man.

661
00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:48.820
Not even Doc or Boone!

662
00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.740
Shiver push on the line
every time, man.

663
00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:53.100
You blow right past 'em!

664
00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:56.620
<i>Push 'em!
Pull 'em! Do something!</i>

665
00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:58.620
You can't run over
everybody in this league,

666
00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.140
and every time you do, you
leave one of your teammates

667
00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:03.100
hanging out to dry...
Me in particular!

668
00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:06.300
Why should I give a hoot
about you, huh?

669
00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:08.220
Or anybody else out there?

670
00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:10.076
You want to talk about a waste,
you the captain?

671
00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:11.100
Right.

672
00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:13.156
- Captain's supposed to be the leader, right?
- Right.

673
00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:14.900
You got a job? You
been doing your job?

674
00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:16.220
I've been doing my job.

675
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.260
Then why don't you tell
your white buddies

676
00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.316
to block for Rev better?
'Cause they have not blocked

677
00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.540
for him worth a plugged nickel,
and you know it!

678
00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:26.820
<i>Nobody plays!
Yourself included!</i>

679
00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:29.620
I'm supposed to wear
myself out for the team?

680
00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.940
What team?!

681
00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.740
No. No, what
I'm gonna do is,

682
00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:36.740
I'm gonna look out for myself,

683
00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.100
and I'm gonna get mine.

684
00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:41.020
See, man?

685
00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:43.340
That's the worst attitude
I ever heard.

686
00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.340
Attitude reflects
leadership, Captain.

687
00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:01.900
<i>Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go!</i>

688
00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.900
<i>Wake up, gentlemen, it's late.</i>

689
00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.260
<i>It's 3 A.M. In the morning.</i>

690
00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:08.340
<i>All right, listen up.</i>

691
00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:11.780
<i>You will follow Doc, myself,
and the other coaches,</i>

692
00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.900
we're gonna take a little
run through the woods.

693
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:16.140
If you get lost along the way,

694
00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:18.300
don't bother
coming back to camp.

695
00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.420
Just hitchhike
your hindparts on home.

696
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:21.780
Any questions?

697
00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:23.740
Coach, this is a high
school football team.

698
00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:27.140
We're not in the marines here.

699
00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.500
Let's go.

700
00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:30.580

<i>This is Gettysburg.</i>

718
00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:37.180
<i>This is where they fought
the Battle of Gettysburg.</i>

719
00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:43.220
50,000 men died right here
on this field,

720
00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:46.380
fightin' the same fight

721
00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:49.180
that we're still fightin'
amongst ourselves...

722
00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:52.220
today.

723
00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:54.260
<i>This green field right here</i>

724
00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:56.020
<i>was painted red.</i>

725
00:32:56.100 --> 00:33:00.580
<i>Bubbling with the blood
of young boys.</i>

726
00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:02.300
Smoke...

727
00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:08.860
and hot lead pouring
right through their bodies.

728
00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:13.220
Listen to their souls, men.

729
00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:17.380
<i>"I killed my brother
with malice in my heart."</i>

730
00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:23.580
"Hatred destroyed my family."

731
00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:26.460
<i>You listen...</i>

732
00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:31.460
and you take a lesson
from the dead.

733
00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:37.020
If we don't come together...

734
00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:41.100
<i>right now,
on this hallowed ground...</i>

735
00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.260
then we, too, will be destroyed.

736
00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:47.700
Just like they were.

737
00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:51.540
I don't care if you
like each other or not,

738
00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:53.900
<i>but you will respect each other,</i>

739
00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:54.980
<i>and maybe...</i>

740
00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:58.180
I don't know, maybe we'll...

741
00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:03.140
learn to play this game
like men.

742
00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:04.340
<i>Hut!</i>

743
00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:09.060
Here we go!

744
00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:11.500
All right.

745
00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:15.260
We'll be out here all night,
until we get this thing right.

746
00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:16.420
Let's go.

747
00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:17.620
<i>Let's go, team, pick it up!</i>

748
00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:18.780
On the ball, Rev.

749
00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:20.100
<i>Come on, everybody.</i>

750
00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:21.420
<i>Get it right!</i>

751
00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.460
<i>Ready!</i>

752
00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:25.740

<i>Check blue!</i>

754
00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:29.300
<i>There it is. Whoo!</i>

755
00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:30.580
<i>Let's go! Hut!</i>

756
00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:35.860
<i>Get him!
Get him! Get him!</i>

757
00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:40.340
What was that, Ray?

758
00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:41.820
Whatever it is,
it ain't blockin'!

759
00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:42.900
Give me a break, Gerry.

760
00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:44.316
You want a break?
I'll give you a break!

761
00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:45.580
Wait a minute, wait, wait.

762
00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:46.660
Let them handle this.

763
00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:48.260
If we get to Rev once,
just one time,

764
00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:49.836
<i>I swear to God,
I'm gonna hit you so hard,</i>

765
00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.100
<i>by the time you come to,</i>

766
00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:52.516
<i>ooh, boy, you're gonna
need a new haircut.</i>

767
00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:54.860
You understand me? Uhh!

768
00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:57.500
<i>Let's play, fellas!</i>

769
00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:01.540
On the ball.
Let's run it again.

770
00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.100
Ready!

771
00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:07.460
<i>All right.</i>

772
00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:08.420
<i>Muskrat!</i>

773
00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:11.140
<i>Set! Hut!</i>

774
00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:19.420
Get off me!

775
00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.780
You all right, big Petey?

776
00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:22.780
You all right?

777
00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:24.460
You really stuck him, Campbell.

778
00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:26.460
Yeah, I love me
a little contact, Petey!

California.

800

This is my son Ronnie,
and he's a quarterback.

801
00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:26.420
How you doing, Ronnie?
This is Coach Yoast.

802
00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:27.660
My pleasure.

803
00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:29.740
We're pretty set at the,
uh, quarterback, Colonel,

you may want to check out
Wilson or Hamilton.

806
00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:36.180

Hold up, hold up.
Listen, now, Blue.

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:00.196
Why are you talking about
Bertier's mama like that?

840
00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.860
See, now, you
making me angry, man.

841
00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:03.900

to shave them old legs
of hers, bro.

846
00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:11.380

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:27.060
Man, I just gave your

00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:21.140
and turn it back over to Yoast.

1050
00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:23.420
One game, just like that?

1051
00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:26.260
<i>What about my family?</i>

1052
00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:27.340
We just got here.

1053
00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:28.916
They just expect me
to pick up and move?

1054
00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:30.220
What about my girls?

1055
00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:33.420
I... I don't know
what to say, I...

1056

winnin' and losin'.

1070

<i>Like all the other schools

1074
00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:35.420
<i>they're all white.</i>

1075
00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:39.020
They don't have
to worry about race.

1076
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:40.860
We do.

1077
00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:44.740
<i>But we're better for it, men.</i>

1078
00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:47.980
Let me tell you something.
You don't let anything...

1079
00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:50.020
nothin'...

1080
00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:51.540
come between us.

1081
00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:53.420
<i>Nothin' tears us apart.</i>

1082
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:54.740
<i>Greek mythology,</i>

1083
00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:58.020
<i>the titans were greater
even than the gods.</i>

1084
00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:00.580
<i>They ruled their universe
with absolute power.</i>

1085
00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:02.460
<i>Well, that football field
out there tonight,</i>

1086
00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:04.380
<i>that's our universe.</i>

1087
00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:06.940
Let's rule it like titans.

1088
00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:08.300
Got it!

1089
00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:16.140
<i>So the Titans defense</i>

1090
00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:17.860
<i>takes the field
for the first time</i>

1091
00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:19.460
<i>against the Hayfield Hawks,</i>

1092
00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:21.220
<i>led by quarterback Daniel Cullum</i>

1093
00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:23.700
<i>on the Hawks 32-yard line.</i>

1094
00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:28.620
We're moving like molasses
out there,

1095
00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:29.940
for crying out loud!

1096
00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:31.540
I mean, come on!

1097
00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:35.340
Mama.

1098
00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:38.980
Are all white girls that crazy?

1099
00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:40.340
What?

1100
00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:42.780
You guys can do
better than that... uhh!

1101
00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:44.300
Yeah!

1102
00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:46.460
<i>Huddle up.
Fellas, huddle up.</i>

1103
00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:47.900
Bosley? Where's Alan?

1104
00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:49.980
Alan, you've got to
stick your man!

1105
00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:51.836
They're gonna score on us
all night if you don't...

1106
00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:53.116
He's too fast, Gerry.
I can't stick with him.

1107
00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:55.020
<i>Let's go, let's go!</i>

1108
00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:56.700
22! Hut!

1109
00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:03.540
<i>Touchdown, Hawks!</i>

1110
00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:11.300
Shape up that defense, Yoast.

1111
00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:12.596
You just worry
about your offense.

1112
00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:14.700
Hey, they score again,
I'm takin' over.

1113
00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:21.220
Ready!

1114
00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:22.500
<i>That's it!</i>

1115
00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:23.820
<i>Watch him!
Watch him!</i>

1116
00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:24.940
<i>Set!</i>

1117
00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:27.620
<i>Hut! Hut!</i>

1118
00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:35.476
Petey, get over here!
What are you doing, son?

1119
00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:37.300
You missed the block by a mile.

1120
00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:39.700
You didn't even have the
football to fumble this time.

1121
00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:41.700
There's no excuse!
No excuse!

1122
00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:43.180
<i>You want to play
football or not?</i>

1123
00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:45.300
Do you want to play football...

1124
00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:46.660
Boy, get over there
on the bench?

1125
00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:51.420
Herb, take over for me.

1126
00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:52.660
You got it.

1127
00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:55.940
Petey!
You all right?

1128
00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:58.700
I was a 2-year starter
at G.W.

1129
00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:00.380
All this yelling he's doing,

1130
00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:02.540
it... it don't do nothing
but make me play worse.

1131
00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:03.860
I can't play for this man.

1132
00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:05.620
You come play linebacker for me.

1133
00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:08.340
23's killing us. I want
you to get out there,

1134
00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:10.100
I want you to cover him for me.

1135
00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:12.220
- You want me to go in now?
- Yeah.

1136
00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:14.180
I can't! I... I...

1137
00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:16.100
I haven't practiced
with the defense. I can't.

1138
00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:17.940
<i>That doesn't matter.
Just get out there.</i>

1139
00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:19.796
I want you to cover 23.
That's all you have to do.

1140
00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:21.260
<i>We'll talk about the rest of it</i>

1141
00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:22.820
<i>when we put this one away.</i>

1142
00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:25.860
You think Yoast is trying to
let them score on purpose?

1143
00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:26.860
What?

1144
00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:27.860
Do you?

1145
00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:29.180
Oh, come on, Herman.

1146
00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:30.540
OK, let's go.

1147
00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:35.140
What is Petey doing in there?

1148
00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:42.220
<i>Looks like Yoast
is trying him out on defense.</i>

1149
00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:44.380
He's taking Alan out.
Yoast!

1150
00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:46.020
Herman, Herman, Herman.

1151
00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:48.460
Come on. Let's see.
Let's see what happens.

1152
00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:49.740
It might be all right.

1153
00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:52.500
It's OK. You're OK.
You're OK. OK.

1154
00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:54.140
Don't you take out my son!

1155
00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:56.780
He's gettin' beat like he
stole somethin', Mr. Bosley.

1156
00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:58.460
You just stay out of it, girl!

1157
00:50:58.540 --> 00:50:59.956
He's just getting beat,
that's all I'm saying.

1158
00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:01.060

Virginia can hear you, baby.

I think they all heard
you fumble, man.

1182

Second of all, who won the game?

1183

My dad is...

1184
00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:16.836
Don't worry about it.
It's not your fault.

1185
00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:18.420
They... they like to show off,

1186
00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:19.620
and that's what they do.

1187
00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:20.980
Wait, wait, wait.
"They"?

1188
00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:22.140
Yeah. What?

1189
00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:23.380
I heard you say "they."

1190
00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:25.380
Yeah, they. Them.
Them over there.

00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:27.276

1220
00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:40.940
Oh, man, that's history, bro.
It's on me. Come on.

1221
00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:46.700
<i>♪ So lonely ♪</i>

1222
00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:51.940
<i>♪ Without you ♪</i>

1223
00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:53.540
<i>♪ But our love ♪</i>

1224
00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:55.460
We're full tonight, boys.

1225
00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:58.140
What? There's tables
all over the place, man.

1226
00:53:58.220 --> 00:53:59.860
What are you talking about?

1227
00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:01.860
Well, this is my establishment.

1228
00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:05.020
I reserve the right
to refuse service to anybody.

1229
00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:07.700
<i>Yeah, that means
you, too, hippie boy.</i>

1230
00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:09.180
Now, y'all want
somethin' to eat,

1231
00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:10.660
you can take these boys out back

1232
00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:12.540
and pick it up from the kitchen.

1233
00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:13.940
What'd I tell you, man?

1234
00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:15.260
Yo, come on, Petey, man!

1235
00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:16.740
Petey, I didn't know, man.

1236
00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:18.820
I told you! What you
mean you didn't know?!

1237
00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:20.196
You think I was
playing with you?!

1238
00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:21.500
Man, he didn't know, Petey.

1239
00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:23.100
Blue, he don't want to know.

1240
00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:25.700
You pull some crap like that,

1241
00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:27.036
you better be able
to back it up.

1242
00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:28.260
Man, let's go, man.

1243
00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:29.860
Why don't you
cool out? Cool out!

1244
00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:30.980
Let's go, Rev.

1245
00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:33.460
<i>Man, let's go, man.</i>

1246
00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:34.420
What happened?

1247
00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:36.740
This man acting
a fool tonight, man.

1248
00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:37.820
<i>Petey.</i>

1249
00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:39.380
Man, don't even talk
to that man, man.

1250
00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:41.100
He acting all crazy
and stuff, man.

1251
00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:42.420
<i>It don't even make no sense.</i>

1252
00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:43.700
<i>Petey.</i>

1253
00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:45.460
<i>He know the man's
from out of town.</i>

1254
00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:49.860
5 times... 5 times,
player of the week.

1255
00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:52.380
He's not some
walk-on scrub, Yoast.

1256
00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:54.540
<i>The boy's a player.
He's a star.</i>

1257
00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:56.220
<i>And he busted his butt for you.</i>

1258
00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:58.220
This is all your doing,
you blacks.

1259
00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:00.380
That is enough.

1260
00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:01.900
<i>It's my call.</i>

1261
00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:03.220
<i>Now listen.</i>

1262
00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:05.580
You just go on home now, Fred,

1263
00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:08.020
before you do something
that you're going to regret.

1264
00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:17.180
Yeah, well...

1265
00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:18.756
I guess we won't be seeing
much of him, huh?

1266
00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:20.220
I will.

1267
00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:21.900
He's on the deacon
board with me.

1268
00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:26.900
<i>All right,
listen, about Petey...</i>

1269
00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:28.620
no thanks required, Coach.

1270
00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:31.460
Thanks?

1271
00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:34.220
You challenged my authority

1272
00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:36.580
in front of the entire
football team, Coach.

1273
00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:38.740
<i>Now, you think you're
doing these boys a favor</i>

1274
00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:41.380
<i>taking them aside every time
I come down on them,</i>

1275
00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:45.260
protecting them
from big bad Boone.

1276
00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:47.380
You're cutting my legs
from under me.

1277
00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:49.796
Some of the boys
just don't respond well

1278
00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:51.100
to public criticism.

1279
00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:52.580
<i>I tell them
what they need to know,</i>

1280
00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:54.380
<i>but I don't humiliate them</i>

1281
00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:57.140
<i>in front of the team.</i>

1282
00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:58.780
Which boys are you
talking about?

1283
00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:02.100
<i>Which ones you talking about?</i>

1284
00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:04.260
<i>I come down on Bertier.
I don't see you coddle him.</i>

1285
00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:07.300
Come down on Sunshine.

1286
00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:10.180
Don't see you grab his hand,
take him off to the side.

1287
00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:13.460
<i>Which boys
are you talking about?</i>

1288
00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:15.540
Now, I may be a mean cuss,

1289
00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:17.140
but I'm the same mean cuss

1290
00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:20.500
with everybody out there
on that football field.

1291
00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:21.500
The world don't give a damn

1292
00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:22.956
about how sensitive
these kids are...

1293
00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:25.380
Especially the young black kids.

1294
00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:28.380
<i>You ain't doing
these kids a favor</i>

1295
00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:29.940
<i>by patronizing them.</i>

1296
00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:34.140
You're crippling them.

1297
00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:36.500
You're crippling them for life.

1298
00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:47.300
Gerry, what are you doing?

1299
00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:49.300
I'm going down to the Berg.

1300
00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:50.300
<i>The Berg?</i>

1301
00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:51.300
Yep.

1302
00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:53.700
What are you doing at the Berg?

1303
00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:55.700
<i>I'm going to play
basketball with Julius.</i>

1304
00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:57.036
<i>Then we're going to
come back here for dinner.</i>

1305
00:56:57.060 --> 00:56:59.340
Gerry, if your father
was still alive...

1306
00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:01.020
Ma, would...

1307
00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:03.340
Just give him a chance.
Just get to know him.

1308
00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:04.620
Listen to him for 2 seconds.

1309
00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:07.140
I don't want to get to know him.

1310
00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:11.460
You are coming to church
with your mother.

1311
00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:15.900
Right, right, right!

1312
00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:17.020
He's mine!

1313
00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:18.100
Hut!

1314
00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:25.380
<i>You blew your assignment!</i>

1315
00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:27.276
Man, I'm covering for you.
Don't get in my face.

1316
00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:29.380
Yo, cool out.
Cool out.

1317
00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:31.500
Where you at?

1318
00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:32.940
What planet you on tonight?

1319
00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:35.220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1320
00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:36.340
I mean, it's fine, man.

1321
00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:37.476
I knew you was going
to stand me up.

1322
00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:38.596
I figured you weren't
going to make out

1323
00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:39.620
to the Berg, no way.

1324
00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:40.660
I knew you was all talk,

1325
00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:41.620
but now you making us look bad

1326
00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:42.620
out there on the field.

1327
00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:44.380
Don't talk to me, man.

1328
00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:45.756
You ain't got nothing
to say to me.

1329
00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:48.060
Why the clouds, Sunshine?

1330
00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:49.780
I can't make that pitch, Petey.

1331
00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:51.980
You ain't gonna
never play anyway,

1332
00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:54.500
unless we're up by 50 points.

1333
00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:55.716
And seeing as how
we ain't never gonna be

1334
00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:56.740
up by no 50 points,

1335
00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:58.700
you might as well
just sit back, relax,

1336
00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:00.060
and enjoy the bench.

1337
00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:01.740
How's it going, yo?

1338
00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:04.220
Man, I didn't sign up
to play like this.

1339
00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:06.100
These guys we're playing
got no heart.

1340
00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:07.780
We play like this
against Groveton,

1341
00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:09.020
we're going down.

1342
00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:11.300
<i>OK, Offense.
Offense, let's go.</i>

1343
00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:15.660
<i>Hut!</i>

1344
00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:21.580
<i>Touchdown, Titans!</i>

1345
00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:23.420
<i>Game, Titans!</i>

1346
00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:33.380
How you doing, Coach?

1347
00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:35.260
Good morning.

1348
00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:36.260
Where's your dad?

1349
00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:37.380
He's in his office.

1350
00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:38.820
<i>Nicky, you all right?</i>

1351
00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:40.500
Yes, Daddy.

1352
00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:41.580
OK.

1353
00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:43.060
What you doing?

1354
00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:46.020
Shooting some hoops.

1355
00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:47.660
Want to play?

1356
00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:55.700
I just did my nails.

1357
00:58:57.060 --> 00:58:59.740
<i>How you doing?
Tyrell.</i>

1358
00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:01.500
Coach... ahem...
If you don't need me,

1359
00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:02.740
I'm going to...

1360
00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:04.220
<i>I'm going to wait out back.</i>

1361
00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:05.300
<i>All right, Herb.</i>

1362
00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:08.900
<i>Coach Boone, to what
do I owe this surprise?</i>

1363
00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:10.140
Have a seat.

1364
00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:13.580
I'll get straight to it.

1365
00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:15.060
We won't survive another game

1366
00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:16.500
like the one we played
last Friday,

1367
00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:19.540
so I spoke to Mr. Vernon
the math teacher,

1368
00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:22.300
asked him to look at
the game film from Groveton,

1369
00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:24.340
who we got next week.

1370
00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:27.300
<i>I asked him
to analyze it for me.</i>

1371
00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:29.500
<i>Every coach has
certain tendencies...</i>

1372
00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:32.700
All of them except Ed Henry.

1373
00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:34.660
The only time
we'd be seeing Ed Henry

1374
00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:36.460
is at the state championship.

1375
00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:46.180
Well, gosh, this is...

1376
00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:47.780
this is great stuff...

1377
00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:50.180
<i>Every quarter broken down,</i>

1378
00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:52.180
<i>how many times they run
each play. I mean...</i>

1379
00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:54.660
You like that, huh?

1380
00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:57.540
We'll be very tough
defensively with this.

1381
00:59:57.620 --> 00:59:59.100
I think so.

1382
01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:02.420
I brought Nicky by.

1383
01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:03.980
She was asking me about Sheryl.

1384
01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:05.116
<i>I'm getting
ready to take her over</i>

1385
01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:07.180
<i>to some of her friends' house.</i>

1386
01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:09.140
Anytime you want to
bring her by the house,

1387
01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:10.940
we'd be more than
happy to have her.

1388
01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:29.700
<i>Oh, he's so cute.</i>

1389
01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:32.220
<i>He's in my third period class.</i>

1390
01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:37.420
What y'all staring
at old Sunshine for?

1391
01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.140
I'm the one dominating
on the field.

1392
01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:40.516
He ain't played
a minute all year.

1393
01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:42.220
Who cares about the field?

1394
01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:44.316
Well, I don't want to be
the one to break your heart,

1395
01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:45.940
but Sunshine's from California.

1396
01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:47.900
Yeah. A California
dreamboat.

1397
01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:49.580
No.

1398
01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:52.060
Sunshine is from California.

1399
01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:53.980
He's a Californian...

1400
01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:55.540
You talking to my girl?

1401
01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:57.900
I don't see any
livestock around here,

1402
01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:00.820
so I don't know what
you talkin' 'bout.

1403
01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:04.580
<i>It's a fight!</i>

1404
01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:05.660
<i>Guys, stop it!</i>

1405
01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:07.220
<i>Get off me. Get off me.</i>

1406
01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:10.900
<i>You want some?</i>

1407
01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:12.780
Hey, hey, break it up.

1408
01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:14.260
Break...

1409
01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:15.420
<i>Get your hands off me, man!</i>

1410
01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:17.380
<i>Hey, get off me!</i>

1411
01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:18.500
Come here, man.

1412
01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:23.300
Petey, get these girls
out of here.

1413
01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.300
Get out of here!

1414
01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:26.300
Uncle Tom traitor!

1415
01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:27.380
Uncle Tom!

1416
01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:29.140
I know you didn't call me
no Uncle Tom.

1417
01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:30.980
Y'all better
back off me now, man.

1418
01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:32.260
Go! Move!

1419
01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:33.356
Looks like you went to the zoo

1420
01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:35.460
and made some
new friends, Bertier.

1421
01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:39.340
Oh, big smart guy, huh?

1422
01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:50.980
<i>Marie has asked about Sheryl.</i>

1423
01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:52.516
<i>Wanted to know if she could
come over and spend the night.</i>

1424
01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:54.516
I told her I'd run it by you,
see what you thought.

1425
01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:56.020
Yeah.

1426
01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:57.276
She's over
at the Boones' tonight.

1427
01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:58.940
I was going to swing by

1428
01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:00.300
on my way home and pick her up.

1429
01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:02.620
Over at the Boones', huh?

1430
01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:03.940
Yeah.

1431
01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:10.060
So that's the way it is, huh?

1432
01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:11.316
Yeah, you haven't changed a bit.

1433
01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:13.020
You was the one trying
to please everybody,

1434
01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:14.660
be the nice guy.

1435
01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:17.700
Sooner or later,
a man's got to pick sides.

1436
01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:21.740
<i>As for me, well, I'm...
I'm not going to put myself</i>

1437
01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:23.876
- through the rest of the
season with that uppity... <i>- Hey.</i>

1438
01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:26.220
I brought you here.

1439
01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:28.740
I want you with me,

1440
01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:30.900
but you got to do
what you got to do.

1441
01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:36.980
That's all you can say to me

1442
01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:38.540
after all we've been through?

1443
01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:39.540
<i>Do what you got to do?</i>

1444
01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:40.620
Hey, Herb...

1445
01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:41.780
You go to hell.

1446
01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:54.020
<i>That veer's getting better.</i>

1447
01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:55.700
<i>I'll admit that.</i>

1448
01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:57.300
<i>But you're still weak
on the left side.</i>

1449
01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:58.820
We're not weak on the left side.

1450
01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:01.420
We just got to work harder
on the left side, that's all.

1451
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.276
- That's not the problem.
- What is the problem?

1452
01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:05.076
You think it is, but it ain't.
It's your pass reads.

1453
01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:06.660
It's not... It's a run anyway.

1454
01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:08.076
It's not a pass.
The veer is a run.

1455
01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:10.340
All right, you two,
that's enough of that.

1456
01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:13.700
Sheryl, don't you want
to play with Nicky?

1457
01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:16.540
I hate playing with dolls.

1458
01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:19.100
I'm not playing.
I'm accessorizing.

1459
01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:20.396
Yeah, why don't you
go accessorize?

1460
01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:22.900
Don't you want to go
accessorize with...

1461
01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:27.180
<i>Hey, "Coach Coon!"</i>

1462
01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:32.380
In the back.
In the back.

1463
01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:34.380
<i>Mommy!</i>

1464
01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:57.860
Where's Coach, man?

1465
01:03:57.940 --> 01:03:58.996
What do he want with us now?

1466
01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:00.636
Coaches ain't called
this meeting tonight.

1467
01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:01.580
We did.

1468
01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:02.940
We outta here.

1469
01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:04.740
<i>Y'all gonna
walk out on your teammate?</i>

1470
01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:05.780
He say he got something to say.

1471
01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:06.740
Y'all got to listen to him.

1472
01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:08.060
Turn around, turn around.

1473
01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:09.620
Where you going?
Turn around.

1474
01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:11.620
Coach Boone brought us
this far, y'all,

1475
01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:14.580
but he ain't going to be
there for us forever, man.

1476
01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:17.220
So what?
We won a few games.

1477
01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:20.260
And y'all fools
think that's something?

1478
01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:22.060
Man, that ain't nothing, y'all.

1479
01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:23.620
<i>And you know what else?</i>

1480
01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:25.780
<i>We ain't nothing, either.</i>

1481
01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:29.020
Yeah, we came together
in camp. Cool.

1482
01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:30.340
But then we're right back here,

1483
01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:31.780
and the world tells us

1484
01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:33.460
that they don't want us
to be together.

1485
01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:34.980
<i>We fall apart</i>

1486
01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:37.620
<i>like we ain't a damn bit
of nothing, man.</i>

1487
01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:39.780
<i>And y'all think
we done won something?</i>

1488
01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:42.340
<i>Man, we ain't won
nothing, y'all...</i>

1489
01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:44.260
<i>Nothing.</i>

1490
01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:45.516
<i>Rev, what's that you're always</i>

1491
01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:46.620
<i>telling me when I get sick</i>

1492
01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:49.460

We're playing Groveton
Friday night, y'all.

1510
01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:37.340
You all gonna play like
you ain't got no heart?

1511
01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:38.580
No!

1512
01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:39.980
Do you all want a victory?

1513
01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:41.060
Yeah!

1514
01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:42.540

01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:43.700

Yeah!

1518
01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:53.740
Like I said,

1519
01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:55.220
we will not be intimidated.

1520
01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:56.820
We're going to play
football games.

1521
01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:59.620
Hatred, violence
will not intimidate us.

1522
01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:00.700
<i>Is that why you need</i>

1523
01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:01.820
<i>the state troopers, Coach?</i>

1524
01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:04.060
Look, I don't need no
John Brown state troopers.

1525
01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:05.356
And you can tell whoever
threw this brick

1526
01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:06.380
through my window

1527
01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:07.900
they can come visit me anytime.

1528
01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:08.900
I'll be at home.

1529
01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:10.180
I think it's time you stopped

1530
01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:12.420
antagonizing everybody and
learned a little humility.

1531
01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:13.580
Humility, huh?

1532
01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:16.020
You know, if you could
just keep your mouth shut

1533
01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:17.900
and if you didn't brag so much...

1534
01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:19.380
I see.
So you're blaming me

1535
01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:20.620
for what happened last night?

1536
01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:23.100
No. I am talking about
setting a good example

1537
01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:24.900
for our boys
and for the community.

1538
01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:26.780
I don't scratch my head
unless it itches,

1539
01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:28.780
and I don't dance unless
I hear some music.

1540
01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:31.220
I will not be intimidated.
That's just the way it is.

1541
01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:32.916
If you want to carry
your sinful pride with you

1542
01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:34.460
to your grave,
that's your business,

1543
01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:36.700
<i>But when your sins
endanger my little girl,</i>

1544
01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:38.380
it becomes mine.

1545
01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:39.740
<i>My sins?</i>

1546
01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:41.740
You think my sins
had something to do

1547
01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:43.420
with what happened last night?

1548
01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.340
<i>I'm sorry about what
happened to your daughter,</i>

1549
01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:46.700
<i>I really am,</i>

1550
01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:48.180
but maybe you got a small taste

1551
01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:49.940
of what my girls go through.

1552
01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:53.860
Welcome to <i>my</i> life, Yoast.

1553
01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:04.220
What's going on?

1554
01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:05.340
Coach.

1555
01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:09.380
Uh, we wanted to let you know

1556
01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:10.340
we was going to warm up

1557
01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:12.620
a little different tonight.

1558
01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:15.220
<i>This is the first
true test of the season</i>

1559
01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:17.220
<i>for the undefeated
T.C. Williams Titans,</i>

1560
01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:19.140
<i>'cause tonight,
they're going up against</i>

1561
01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:22.020
<i>the undefeated Groveton Lions.</i>

1562
01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:24.420
<i>Their all-state noseguard
Kip Tyler</i>

1563
01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:26.780
<i>is as mean as
a copperhead snake.</i>

1564

Not at quarterback, son.

1618
01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:49.820
I can't make that pitch, Coach.

1619
01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:50.900
Yes, you can.

1620
01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:54.100
When I was 15 years old,

1621
01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:55.660
I lost my mother and my father

1622
01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:58.100
in the same month, Ronnie...
The same month.

1623
01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:00.260
12 brothers and sisters.
I was the youngest one,

1624
01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:01.980
but they were all
looking up to me.

1625
01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:04.180
Now, I wasn't ready yet,
either, but they needed me.

- Yes, sir.

1752
01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:26.180
leadership on and off the field

1753
01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:28.020
and high moral standards
as well.

1754
01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:29.700
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1755
01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:34.020
<i>let me introduce to you
the 1971 Hall of Fame nominees.</i>

1756
01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:38.260
Come on, Daddy.

1757
01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:43.020
When we played Jefferson,

1758
01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:45.420
we were down by 4
with 10 seconds left.

1759
01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:47.340
So we blitzed the safety
from the weak side...

1760
01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:52.340
Heck of a season
the Titans are having, Coach.

1761
01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:54.060
Too bad it's got to end.

1762
01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:56.740
Oh, we're still in it, Lyle.

1763
01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:57.980
Taber's boys are pretty good,

1764
01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:00.180
but I think we'll take
'em in the regional.

1765
01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:03.220
Well, not if we have anything
to say about it.

1766
01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:05.940
You just leave this to us, Bill.

1767
01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:10.380
Boone's out, and you're
head coach again.

1768
01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:13.580
And all roads lead
to the Hall of Fame.

1769
01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:14.620
<i>Coach Taber?</i>

1770
01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:16.196
What do you think
of the Titans, Coach?

1771
01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:17.516
Think you have a chance
against that defense

1772
01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:19.060
they have over there
at T.C.?

1773
01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:22.460
<i>Ton, Billy, Ray,
come on over here.</i>

1774
01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:25.980
<i>Boys. These are
my all-American tackles.</i>

1775
01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:27.580
Prize bulls who don't do nothin'

1776
01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:29.620
but knock the chocolate
out of folks.

1777
01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:31.580
<i>Is it true
you're not gonna trade films</i>

1778
01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:32.820
<i>with Coach Boone?</i>

1779
01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:35.820
I'm not gonna do anything
to help that monkey.

1780
01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:39.780
<i>Well...</i>

1781
01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:42.940
what are we going
to do about this?

1782
01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:45.700
We're gonna get ready
for Saturday.

1783
01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:47.380
See you out there on the field.

1784
01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:51.180
<i>Hut!</i>

1785
01:17:57.780 --> 01:17:59.100
<i>Hey, Mr. Official.</i>

1786
01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:01.420
Mr. Official, can I talk
to you for a second?

1787
01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:03.700
Back off, Coach, if you
want to stay in this game.

1788
01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:06.260
Hut!

1789
01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:12.180
I've got holding on 78 white.

1790
01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:14.940
Are you trying to cheat
my boys out of the game?

1791
01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:16.140
15 more yards.

1792
01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:18.500
<i>Let 'em play, Ref, let 'em play.</i>

1793
01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:20.660
Let 'em play!
Let the boys play!

1794
01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:21.660
Cheater!

1795
01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:22.660
Coach, come on.

1796
01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:23.740
<i>Cheater!</i>

1797
01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:24.940
<i>Coach.</i>

1798
01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:33.380
Go, go, go, go!

1799
01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:40.900
<i>Oh, come on!
What was that?!</i>

1800
01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:44.460
What are you, blind?

1801
01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:45.900
<i>That wasn't a hold.</i>

1802
01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:48.860
Oh, come on, that was
such a bad call.

1803
01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:53.580
Titus!

1804
01:18:57.260 --> 01:18:59.900
<i>Give him a piece of your mind!</i>

1805
01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:06.180
I know all about it, Titus.

1806
01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:07.780
What are you
talking about, Bill?

1807
01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:09.180
You call this game fair,

1808
01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:11.500
or I'll go to the papers.

1809
01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:14.180
I don't care
if I go down with ya,

1810
01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:16.900
but before God, I swear I'll see

1811
01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:19.540
every last one of you
thrown in jail.

1812
01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:21.060
You dig your own grave.

1813
01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:23.140
OK.

1814
01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:24.860
Defense! On me!

1815
01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:28.100
OK, Petey, don't you drift
to the strong side.

1816
01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:30.156
Coach, they're callin' a holding
penalty on me every time.

1817
01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:31.620
Did I ask for your excuses?

1818
01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.580
<i>You want to act like a star,</i>

1819
01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:34.796
you better give me
a star effort,

1820
01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:36.420
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

1821
01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:39.740
Forget about him!

1822
01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:42.380
<i>Alan, you're in!</i>

1823
01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:43.700
Come on!

1824
01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:45.780
All right, now,

1825
01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:48.860
I don't want them
to gain another yard.

1826
01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:51.580
<i>You blitz all night!</i>

1827
01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:52.956
If they cross
the line of scrimmage,

1828
01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:54.820
I'm gonna take
every last one of you out.

1829
01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:56.580
<i>You make sure...</i>

1830
01:19:56.660 --> 01:19:59.980
they remember forever

1831
01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:02.060
the night they played
the Titans.

1832
01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:06.660
Leave no doubt!

1833
01:20:08.980 --> 01:20:10.100
<i>Set!</i>

1834
01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:12.060

<i>Real comfortable.</i>

1839
01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:57.460
You did good!

1840
01:20:57.540 --> 01:20:59.460
That one was for you, Coach.

All right, baby.
All right.

1842
01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:03.300
You brought us here, Coach.

1843
01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:04.940

Don't move.

Go on.
It's OK.

1882
01:22:50.380 --> 01:22:51.620
- Man.
- What's up, man?

1883
01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:53.300
Let's get out of here.

1884
01:22:53.380 --> 01:22:54.980
Let's go paint the town
or something.

1885

Let's go. Let's go.

1890
01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:02.420
I don't know.

1891

I... I don't know,
but I'm gonna go. All right?

1892
01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:06.580
- You gonna go?
- Yeah, man.

1893
01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:08.940
I want to go, man, but you
know what I mean, man.

1894
01:23:09.020 --> 01:23:10.020
I know.
I'll see ya.

1895
01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:24.500
Looks like you weren't the one

1896
01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:26.460
with the mixed-up
priorities, huh?

1897
01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:28.100
Emma...

1898
01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:30.860
I think it's gonna
take me a little longer

1899
01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:32.740

1900
01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:33.940
But, um...

1901
01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:39.220
I just wanted you to know
that I'm gonna try.

1902

Good-bye, Gerry.

01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:51.060
Make me a promise?

1905
01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:53.420
You'll be there to root for us

1906
01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:55.620

01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:23.420
I wanted it, too.

1915
01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:26.780
But there's always next year
or the year after that.

1916
01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:29.140
As long as it takes
for them to wise up.

1917
01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:32.220
Wouldn't want it now anyway.

1918
01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:34.340

01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:48.900
Daddy! You're home!

1924

My girls! Mmm-ah!

1925
01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:52.540
Give me a kiss.

1926
01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:54.180
Congratulations, Herman.

1927
01:24:54.260 --> 01:24:55.500
All right. Mmm.

1928
01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:57.100
What'd I tell you, baby, huh?

1929
01:24:57.180 --> 01:24:59.580
Yeah, we can't get too
far ahead of ourselves.

1930
01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:02.780
We still got to get
Ed Henry and Marshall.

1931
01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:04.100

1940
01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:25.100

01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:48.700
He ain't all right?
He all right?

1964
01:26:48.780 --> 01:26:49.820
He's, uh...

1965
01:26:49.900 --> 01:26:51.140
How's he doing?

1966
01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:56.620
Not too good.
Not too good.

1967
01:26:56.700 --> 01:26:58.300
How well is he doing?

1968
01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:00.460
How bad is it?

1969
01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:02.020
How bad is it?

1970
01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:05.060
He's paralyzed
from the waist down.

1971
01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:08.660
Don't say that to me.
Don't say that to me.

1972
01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:14.740
Sorry, Mrs. Bertier.

1973
01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:19.540
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1974
01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:23.820
He doesn't want to see
anybody but you, Julius.

1975
01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:25.260
Yes, ma'am.

1976
01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:26.940
You be strong.

1977
01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:28.300
Yes, ma'am.

1978
01:27:28.380 --> 01:27:32.420
Those tears are not gonna
make my boy walk again.

1979
01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:44.540
Only kin's allowed in here.

1980
01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:48.020
Alice, are you blind?

1981
01:27:48.100 --> 01:27:51.420
Don't you see
the family resemblance?

1982
01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:53.460
<i>That's my brother.</i>

1983
01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:57.220
All right.

1984
01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:12.380
Oh, man.

1985
01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:14.700
Well, you think
I look banged up,

1986
01:28:14.780 --> 01:28:16.580
you should see my Camaro.

1987
01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:21.540
Man, I sure am sorry, man.

1988
01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:24.220
I should have
been there with you.

1989
01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:27.620
What are you talking about?

1990
01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:30.220
You would've been in that bed
right next to me.

1991
01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:32.980
You can't be hurt like this.

1992
01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:38.140
You... you're Superman.

1993
01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:46.900
I was afraid of you, Julius.

1994
01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:53.460
<i>I only saw what I was afraid of.</i>

1995
01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:56.980
And now I know I was
only hating my brother.

1996
01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:01.940
I'll tell you what, though.

1997
01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:04.460
Um, when all this is over...

1998
01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:07.020
me and you are gonna move out

1999
01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:08.580
to the same
neighborhood together.

2000
01:29:08.660 --> 01:29:12.460
OK? And, um...

2001
01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:16.260
and we'll get old,
and we'll get fat.

2002
01:29:16.340 --> 01:29:18.260
And there ain't gonna be
all this black-white

2003
01:29:18.340 --> 01:29:19.340
between us.

2004
01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:27.620
Left side.

2005
01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:31.540
Strong side.

2006
01:29:38.580 --> 01:29:39.780
Good morning.

2007
01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:41.020
Good morning.

2008
01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:45.460
Uh, the Marshall film.

2009
01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:46.860
<i>Well, that's good.</i>

2010
01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:48.196
We're gonna have
to be real sharp

2011
01:29:48.220 --> 01:29:51.140
on the offensive
and defensive sides

2012
01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:52.460
of the football.

2013
01:29:52.540 --> 01:29:53.980
Figure we give the kids

2014
01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:55.516
a couple of extra
practices this week,

2015
01:29:55.540 --> 01:29:57.060
make sure they stay focused.

2016
01:29:57.140 --> 01:30:00.300
Got a press conference
today at 12 noon.

2017
01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:02.740
Press conference?

2018
01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:06.060
Listen, what we do here
amongst ourselves is one thing,

2019
01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:08.260
but we are not gonna
parade around

2020
01:30:08.380 --> 01:30:10.036
talking about football
at a time like this.

2021
01:30:10.060 --> 01:30:11.556
Hold on. I'm not talking
about parading.

2022
01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:13.500
I'm talking about
going out there,

2023
01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:15.380
presentin' a strong,
united front.

2024
01:30:15.460 --> 01:30:17.500
Now, I'm hurtin'...

2025
01:30:17.580 --> 01:30:19.380
just like you are, Yoast,

2026
01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:22.220
but the season is not over yet.

2027
01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:25.020
I did... We did not come this far

2028
01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:27.420
to just break down and lose now.

2029
01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:30.860
Everything's not always
about winning and losing.

2030
01:30:30.940 --> 01:30:32.860
I'm a winner.

2031
01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:36.500
I'm going to win.

2032
01:30:36.580 --> 01:30:39.900
Is this even about
football anymore?

2033
01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:42.100
Or is it just about you?

2034
01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:44.860
<i>Coach Boone...</i>

2035
01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:47.460
<i>Uh, Coach, you lost Bertier...</i>

2036
01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:49.100
<i>Is your defense in trouble?</i>

2037
01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:51.660
You cannot replace
a Gerry Bertier...

2038
01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:56.580
<i>as a player or person.</i>

2039
01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:03.100
I don't know, Mama.

2040
01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:08.900
Maybe Yoast was right.

2041
01:31:08.980 --> 01:31:10.900
Maybe I pushed 'em too hard.

2042
01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:13.100
Gerry had an accident.

2043
01:31:14.980 --> 01:31:17.060
Sometimes life's just hard.

2044
01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:20.140
For no reason at all.

2045
01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:22.900
You think I was blinded
by my own ambition?

2046
01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:27.700
Mm. Whatever kind
of ambition it took

2047
01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:30.500
to do what you did
around here...

2048
01:31:30.580 --> 01:31:33.220
this world could use
a lot more of it, Herman.

2049
01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:46.660
<i>Hey, Coach.</i>

2050
01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:47.780
Hey, Coach.

2051
01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:49.180
How you doing?

2052
01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:57.180
This for me?

2053
01:31:57.260 --> 01:32:00.700
I want you to be my eyes
out there, all right?

2054
01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:04.020
<i>Any of these guys slack off,</i>

2055
01:32:04.100 --> 01:32:05.940
<i>you just let me know.</i>

2056
01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:07.740
You bet I will.

2057
01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:11.900
How you doing, Gerry?

2058
01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:13.620
<i>I'm all right, Coach.</i>

2059
01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:15.276
I was just talking
to these guys about Marshall,

2060
01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:16.340
trying to get 'em...

2061
01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:18.620
You don't need to talk
about football now.

2062
01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:21.140
I think this is a good
time for reflection

2063
01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:22.300
and for prayer...

2064
01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:23.860
Coach...

2065
01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:25.740
I'm hurt.

2066
01:32:25.820 --> 01:32:26.980
I ain't dead.

2067
01:32:27.060 --> 01:32:29.460
No, you're not.

2068
01:32:29.540 --> 01:32:31.220
<i>No, you're not.</i>

2069
01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:35.220
You know, I've been,
uh, reading up

2070
01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:37.620
<i>on the activities
that they got for people</i>

2071
01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:40.060
<i>in wheelchairs and such.</i>

2072
01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:42.980
They got Olympics.

2073
01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:47.300
<i>This is the granddaddy</i>

2074
01:32:47.380 --> 01:32:49.980
<i>of state high school football
championships.</i>

2075
01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:51.820
<i>The Virginia triple "A."</i>

2076
01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:54.820
<i>It just doesn't get any better.</i>

2077
01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:56.740
<i>We have
Coach Herman Boone's Titans</i>

2078
01:32:56.820 --> 01:32:58.980
<i>vs. the legend, Ed Henry,</i>

2079
01:32:59.060 --> 01:33:03.060
<i>with over 250 wins in 30 years.</i>

2080
01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:04.980
Amen.

2081
01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:06.020
Amen.

2082
01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:07.140
Let's go!

2083
01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:14.500
Lastik, what's the matter?

2084
01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:17.460
I'm eligible.

2085
01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:21.180
Well, um, I'm glad
to hear that, son,

2086
01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:22.580
but I'm already married.

2087
01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:26.620
I got a C-plus average, Coach.

2088
01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:28.620
I'm going to college.

2089
01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:32.180
All right, fantastic.

2090
01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:34.180
Coach? Coach?

2091
01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:36.380
I just want to say I'm sorry.

2092
01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:38.860
You abandoned your team
in their moment of need, Petey.

2093
01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:39.956
"Sorry" won't make up for that.

2094
01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:41.220
Yeah, I know, but...

2095
01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:43.300
listen, I want to play for you.

2096
01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:45.180
I want to play
for the championship.

2097
01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:46.740
You can play for me next year.

2098
01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:48.100
You sit on that bench.

2099
01:33:48.180 --> 01:33:50.140
Show me you can support
your teammates.

2100
01:33:50.220 --> 01:33:52.100
You'll start again as a senior.

2101
01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:01.380

2102
01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:03.740

2104

Hi, I'm Emma Hoyt.

2121
01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:15.980
Oh. Oh, I guess
we never met, huh?

2122
01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:17.876
Uh, excuse me, young lady.
You can't be here right now.

2123
01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:20.500
<i>You gonna have
to get back to your seat.</i>

2124
01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:24.020
Well, now we've met.

2125
01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:27.660
Yeah.
It's nice to meet you.

2126
01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:29.300
Good luck, Julius.

2127
01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:30.500
2! 21!

2128
01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:31.580
<i>Whoa! Wait!</i>

2129
01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:32.860
What the hell's going on?

2130
01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:33.980
Shotgun.

2131
01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:35.500
Who do they think they are,

2132
01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:36.660
the New York Jets?

2133
01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:37.660
<i>Switch! Switch!</i>

2134
01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:38.740
Get 9!

2135
01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:41.420
<i>Get 9!
Bosley, move!</i>

2136
01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:44.740
<i>Move it up! Line up!
Get Bosley! Get 9! Get 9!</i>

2137
01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:47.660
All right, let's go!

2138
01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:48.740
Hut hut!

2139
01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:55.180
Real good.

2140
01:35:55.260 --> 01:35:56.420
Keep it up.
Shotgun rush.

2141
01:35:56.500 --> 01:35:59.700
<i>Cover 3!
Go to cover 3! Pass!</i>

2142
01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:01.140
Hut!

2143
01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:12.180
Put some pressure
on that Q.B.

2144
01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:13.660
They got all day
to throw, Coach.

2145
01:36:13.740 --> 01:36:15.260
You just worry
about your offense.

2146
01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:19.780
<i>Let's go!
Swing it! Swing it!</i>

2147
01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:20.900
<i>Set!</i>

2148
01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:21.860
<i>Get set! Get set!</i>

2149
01:36:21.940 --> 01:36:23.620
Hut!

2150
01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:27.740
Yeah!

2151
01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:31.660
<i>No!</i>

2152
01:36:31.740 --> 01:36:32.940
<i>What's wrong, Gerry?</i>

2153
01:36:33.060 --> 01:36:35.500
<i>Do not come in here!</i>

2154
01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:38.636
They got receivers
everywhere out there.

2155
01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:40.460
It's like watching
<i>Monday Night Football.</i>

2156
01:36:40.540 --> 01:36:42.380
Good hustle, good hustle,
good hustle.

2157
01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:44.340
Just give him a little cushion.

2158
01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:46.076
And when they throw
that ball, you stick him.

2159
01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:47.180
- Ready?
- Break!

2160
01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:51.220
Ready?!

2161
01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:53.460
<i>Red, 57!</i>

2162
01:36:53.540 --> 01:36:54.820
<i>Red, 57!</i>

2163
01:36:54.900 --> 01:36:57.660
Hut! Hut hut!

2164
01:37:02.980 --> 01:37:04.380
<i>Titans star quarterback,</i>

2165
01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:07.940
<i>Ronnie Bass, gains 6 yards.</i>

2166
01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:09.820
What you think? You
think we got a chance?

2167
01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:11.436
Got to give me some way
to disguise that coverage.

2168
01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:12.796
Let's start thinking
about it. Let's go.

2169
01:37:12.820 --> 01:37:14.220
<i>Ready!</i>

2170
01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:16.180
Set!

2171
01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:17.260
<i>Hut!</i>

2172
01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:29.100
They're a mile ahead of us.

2173
01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:30.356
He's a mile ahead of you, Coach.

2174
01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:31.716
If your defense
would stop somebody,

2175
01:37:31.740 --> 01:37:33.340
we'd get the ball a little more.

2176
01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:34.820
<i>Well, the Titans
gave 'em a scare,</i>

2177
01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:37.740
<i>but Ed Henry looks
supremely confident.</i>

2178
01:37:37.820 --> 01:37:40.180
<i>T.C. Williams
goes in at the half</i>

2179
01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:41.940
<i>trailing 7-0.</i>

2180
01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:43.540
<i>Coach!</i>

2181
01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:44.660
Sweetheart.

2182
01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:45.836
You better get back
to your seat.

2183
01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:47.540
I can't, Coach.
What?

2184
01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:49.740
Ed Henry's got Boone's
number, sure as shootin'.

2185
01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:53.580
And you ain't doin' nothin'
against that shotgun.

2186
01:37:53.660 --> 01:37:54.820
Look, Coach...

2187
01:37:54.900 --> 01:37:57.580
now ain't the time to be proud.

2188
01:37:57.700 --> 01:38:00.020
It's all right.
We're in a fight.

2189
01:38:01.100 --> 01:38:03.660
You boys are doing
all that you can do.

2190
01:38:03.740 --> 01:38:05.180
Anybody can see that.

2191
01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:09.820
Win or lose...

2192
01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:11.620
we gonna walk out
of this stadium tonight

2193
01:38:11.740 --> 01:38:13.340
with our heads held high.

2194
01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:16.900
Do your best.

2195
01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:19.020
That's all anybody can ask for.

2196
01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:20.300
No, it ain't, Coach.

2197
01:38:20.420 --> 01:38:24.340
With all due respect, uh,
you demanded more of us.

2198
01:38:24.420 --> 01:38:26.740
You demanded perfection.

2199
01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:30.500
Now, I ain't saying that
I'm perfect, 'cause I'm not.

2200
01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:33.140
And I ain't gonna never be.
None of us are.

2201
01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:37.500
But we have won every single
game we have played till now.

2202
01:38:37.580 --> 01:38:40.700
So this team is perfect.

2203
01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:44.100
We stepped out on that field
that way tonight.

2204
01:38:44.180 --> 01:38:47.140
And, uh, if it's all the same
to you, Coach Boone,

2205
01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:49.220
<i>that's how we want to leave it.</i>

2206
01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:50.620
<i>Yeah.</i>

2207
01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:53.700
I hope you boys have learned
as much from me this year

2208
01:38:53.780 --> 01:38:55.940
as I've learned from you.

2209
01:38:56.020 --> 01:38:59.300
You've taught this city how
to trust the soul of a man

2210
01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:01.220
rather than the look of him.

2211
01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:04.580
And I guess it's about time
I joined the club.

2212
01:39:04.660 --> 01:39:07.500
Herman! I sure could
use your help.

2213
01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:09.780
Ed Henry's kicking my ass
out there.

2214
01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:12.380
Listen up.
This is our time now.

2215
01:39:12.460 --> 01:39:14.380
Second half is our time!

2216
01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:15.940
We gonna make some changes
on defense.

2217
01:39:15.980 --> 01:39:17.540
They're spreading us out
too far.

2218
01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:21.780
We gonna put Sunshine, Alan,
Glascoe, Davis.

2219
01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:24.420
You gonna play both ways,
rest of the game.

2220
01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:25.700
I don't want a receiver

2221
01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:27.500
to get across that line
of scrimmage.

2222
01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:29.900
Coach Yoast will tell you
where you're playing, all right?

2223
01:39:29.980 --> 01:39:31.500
Let's go. It's our time.
Everybody in.

2224
01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:33.620
Our time! Our time!
Our time!

2225
01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:35.820
Titans on 3! 1, 2, 3!

2226
01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:36.900
Titans!

2227
01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:39.340
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!

2228
01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:40.620
All right, Julius.

2229
01:39:40.700 --> 01:39:42.060
We're gonna go 52 monster.

2230
01:39:42.140 --> 01:39:43.820
I know that's all
you need to know.

2231
01:39:43.900 --> 01:39:45.596
All right, we're going
zone, Alan. I need...

2232
01:39:45.620 --> 01:39:46.716
Sir, I could play
with Roosevelt.

2233
01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:48.820
But I cannot play
with these guys.

2234
01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:50.460
No, I tell you what.

2235
01:39:50.540 --> 01:39:52.140
I didn't warm the bench all year

2236
01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:54.020
so I could watch us
go down on my account.

2237
01:39:54.100 --> 01:39:57.260
Put Petey in.
He's better.

2238
01:39:57.340 --> 01:39:59.580
<i>You want him to take your spot,</i>

2239
01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:01.620
you go give it to him.

2240
01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:04.260
Thank you.

2241
01:40:19.180 --> 01:40:20.180
All right, Petey!

2242
01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:22.060
All right!
That was beautiful!

2243
01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:25.540

Look, 48's offsides!

2268

You got eyes!

Gun-right, 84, X-flat.

2271
01:41:37.340 --> 01:41:39.700
And tell Tommy to watch
the free safety. Go.

2272

Get right in there, Blue.
You know what I'm talking about.

2273

You can't be afraid.

2274

He's offsides!
He's lining up offsides!

2275
01:41:46.940 --> 01:41:48.660
Got to hold them here, Defense!

2276

Whoa! Pass! Pass!

2278
01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:54.740

Ohh, Petey!

2292
01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:42.620
Coach.

2293
01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:43.900
Get a time-out!
Time-out!

2294
01:42:43.980 --> 01:42:45.716
Coach, they're slanting to
our strong side every time.

2295
01:42:45.740 --> 01:42:46.756
You got to catch 'em
in that slant

2296
01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:47.780
and let 'em overpursue.

2297
01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:49.100
He's onto your game.

2298
01:42:49.180 --> 01:42:52.420
You got to throw something
at him he's not ready for.

2299
01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:55.300
- Rev! Where's Rev?
- Yes, sir.

2300
01:42:55.380 --> 01:42:57.316
- All right, listen, you ready to run?
- Yes, sir.

2301
01:42:57.340 --> 01:42:59.940
Fake 23 blast...

2302
01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:01.700
with a backside George reverse.

2303
01:43:01.780 --> 01:43:03.620
You got that?
Fake 23 blast

2304
01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:05.020
with a backside George reverse.

2305
01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:06.156
Like your life depended upon it.

2306
01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:08.220
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go get 'em!

2307
01:43:08.300 --> 01:43:10.300
<i>The Titans take the field</i>

2308
01:43:10.380 --> 01:43:14.060
<i>with time to run one final play
for the state championship.</i>

2309
01:43:14.140 --> 01:43:16.180
I thought he was injured.

2310
01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:17.620
I guess not.

2311
01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:19.620
Why are they
bringing in a Q.B.?

2312
01:43:19.700 --> 01:43:21.140
<i>The Titans have 75 yards</i>

2313
01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:22.460
<i>to get to the end zone.</i>

2314
01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:24.780
Oh, my gosh.
I can't watch this.

2315
01:43:24.860 --> 01:43:26.460
I can't watch this. No.

2316
01:43:26.540 --> 01:43:27.940
What? What?
Sheryl, what's wrong?

2317
01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:29.340
No, I can't watch it.

2318
01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:30.420
Sheryl!

2319
01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:32.860
No, it's too bad.
Not now. Not now.

2320
01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:38.820
They're gonna throw it deep.
Cover deep!

2321
01:43:38.940 --> 01:43:41.380
<i>Watch
the deep pass! Cover it deep!</i>

2322
01:43:41.460 --> 01:43:44.260
Ready! Set! Hut!

2323
01:44:25.820 --> 01:44:27.300
Well, that's it, boys.

2324
01:44:27.380 --> 01:44:28.460
That's it.

2325
01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:29.980
Good season.

2326
01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:31.140
It's all right.

2327
01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:33.220
Yes! Yes!

2328
01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:34.420
Come on.

2329
01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:39.500
Congratulations, Coach.

2330
01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:40.740
All right.
Thank you, Coach.

2331
01:44:40.820 --> 01:44:42.340
You did a good job.
Played a fine game.

2332
01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:45.660
I know football,

2333
01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:47.780
but what you did
with those boys...

2334
01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:50.900
<i>You were the right man
for the job, coach!</i>

2335
01:44:50.980 --> 01:44:52.860
You're a Hall of Famer
in my book.

2336
01:45:18.580 --> 01:45:21.940
<i>The Titans
danced their way into history.</i>

2337
01:45:22.020 --> 01:45:23.900
<i>13 and 0, the perfect season.</i>

2338
01:45:23.980 --> 01:45:25.900
<i>State champions
and first runner-up</i>

2339

<i>for the national championship.</i>

2340
01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:30.100
<i>Second-best high school team
in the country.</i>

2341
01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:33.340
<i>Gerry Bertier won a gold medal
for the shot put</i>

2342
01:45:33.420 --> 01:45:34.900
<i>in the wheelchair games.</i>

2343
01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:37.180
<i>Daddy coached him.</i>

<i>10 years later, Gerry died.</i>

2345
01:45:39.780 --> 01:45:42.580
<i>And that's what brought us
back here today.</i>

2346
01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:46.540
<i>Gerry is gone,
but his spirit lives on.</i>

2347
01:45:46.620 --> 01:45:49.500
<i>People say that it can't work,
black and white.</i>

2348
01:45:49.580 --> 01:45:52.220
<i>Well, here we make it work
every day.</i>

2349
