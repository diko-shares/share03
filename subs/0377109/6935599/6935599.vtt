[wind blowing]

3
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.820
- [man] Hey.
- [gasps]

4
00:01:46.903 --> 00:01:48.572
Hey.

5
00:01:50.824 --> 00:01:52.451
I wanna show you something.

6
00:01:53.744 --> 00:01:55.537
What?

7
00:01:58.957 --> 00:02:01.126
[clears throat]

8
00:02:02.753 --> 00:02:05.672
Have you ever seen
something so scary

9
00:02:05.756 --> 00:02:08.467
that you had to show
to someone else?

10
00:02:09.092 --> 00:02:10.469
Um...

11
00:02:10.552 --> 00:02:13.639
I mean, like, you know,
a movie or something.

12
00:02:13.722 --> 00:02:15.432
Well...

13
00:02:15.515 --> 00:02:20.562
I've got the scariest
freakin' movie you'll ever see.

14
00:02:20.646 --> 00:02:24.858
Now... A buddy of mine
actually turned me on to it.

15
00:02:24.941 --> 00:02:26.902
And, uh, he made me a copy.

16
00:02:26.985 --> 00:02:30.238
So... I did one for you.

17
00:02:30.322 --> 00:02:32.324
You brought me here
to watch a video?

18
00:02:32.407 --> 00:02:36.161
Well, two minutes. OK?
Two minutes and it'll all be over.

19
00:02:36.244 --> 00:02:38.789
It's totally underground stuff.

20
00:02:38.872 --> 00:02:42.376
- I thought we were gonna just...
- No, we will. We will.

21
00:02:42.417 --> 00:02:46.129
You just gotta see this.
I'm telling you, it's...

22
00:02:46.254 --> 00:02:49.508
- How about after we...?
- No, you need to watch it now.

23
00:02:51.635 --> 00:02:53.637
OK?

24
00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.976
What's so scary about it?

25
00:03:11.697 --> 00:03:13.657
You'll see.

26
00:03:28.505 --> 00:03:32.718
[breathing heavily]

27
00:03:34.136 --> 00:03:37.389
Play it. Just play the thing.

28
00:03:37.472 --> 00:03:40.267
Come on,
I got two minutes here, please.

29
00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:17.053
[TV static]

30
00:04:21.141 --> 00:04:24.561
[panting nervously]

31
00:04:24.603 --> 00:04:27.022
Emily, play the goddamn tape!

32
00:04:27.105 --> 00:04:33.028
[humming, hissing]

00:04:33.111 --> 00:04:35.781

35
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.662
[sighs]

36
00:04:49.544 --> 00:04:53.632
[whining continues]

37
00:04:53.715 --> 00:04:56.676
[phone ringing]

38
00:05:00.555 --> 00:05:03.725
[high-pitched electronic whine]

39
00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:07.103
[ringing continues]

40
00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:19.282
- Hello?
- [man] Hey, man, you made it.

41
00:05:19.366 --> 00:05:22.661
I knew you'd come through.
You got somebody to watch it, huh?

42
00:05:23.995 --> 00:05:27.123
[sighing] Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, man.

43
00:05:27.165 --> 00:05:29.751
Some stupid chick
from my school.

44
00:05:29.835 --> 00:05:32.712
[man] Good. I was afraid
you didn't believe me, man.

45
00:05:32.796 --> 00:05:36.675
Now it's her problem. She doesn't
get someone else to watch it in a week,

46
00:05:36.758 --> 00:05:38.760
I swear she's dead.

47
00:05:38.844 --> 00:05:41.096
So, did you tell her what happens

48
00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:43.723
or you just gonna let her
find out for herself?

49
00:05:43.807 --> 00:05:45.350
[water gurgling]

50
00:05:45.433 --> 00:05:47.978
[man] Jake?

51
00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:50.647
Come on, it's over, dude.

52
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.818
Jake. This isn't funny, man.

53
00:05:54.901 --> 00:05:57.362
-Jake?
- [hangs up phone]

54
00:05:57.445 --> 00:05:59.364
Emily?

55
00:06:14.671 --> 00:06:15.922
Emily!

56
00:06:20.635 --> 00:06:22.470
Emily!

57
00:06:22.554 --> 00:06:26.266
- Emily, what the hell did you do?
- I played it, I just didn't look.

58
00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:28.935
[TV static]

59
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.441
[static stops]

00:06:34.524 --> 00:06:40.071
[rumbling, hissing]

00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:55.295
[breathing heavily]

62
00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:59.299
[distant shout]

63
00:06:59.382 --> 00:07:02.886
[screaming]

64
00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:07.891

66
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.781
[woman chuckling]

67
00:07:22.864 --> 00:07:25.700
Come on, Aidan, let's go home.

68
00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:23.466
It was the right choice.
No question.

69
00:08:29.055 --> 00:08:32.851
Aidan, dinner's ready.

70
00:08:34.978 --> 00:08:37.522
[sighs] Damn.

71
00:08:39.482 --> 00:08:41.151
Aidan!

72
00:08:56.458 --> 00:09:00.378
OK, now, before you say anything,
I followed the recipe this time.

73
00:09:00.462 --> 00:09:03.548
Just 'cause it doesn't look
like the one in the magazine,

74
00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:06.676
doesn't mean to say
it won't taste good.

75
00:09:10.346 --> 00:09:14.517
Those are great, honey.
Got a really good eye.

76
00:09:20.315 --> 00:09:22.776
He'd be proud of you.

77
00:09:23.526 --> 00:09:25.612
Thanks, Rachel.

78
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:32.410
You know, it wouldn't kill you
to call me "mom" now and again.

79
00:09:32.494 --> 00:09:34.871
"Ma-II "Mommy-II

80
00:09:34.996 --> 00:09:38.500
Something besides "Rachel".

81
00:09:38.583 --> 00:09:40.460
Yeah, I like "Rachel".

82
00:09:40.502 --> 00:09:43.213
Well, "mom" has its charms too,
you know.

83
00:09:43.338 --> 00:09:45.548
But "Rachel"
is more your personality.

84
00:09:45.632 --> 00:09:46.841
Really?

85
00:09:47.717 --> 00:09:52.597
Well, Rachel declares dinnertime.

86
00:09:59.604 --> 00:10:02.774
It's working out great,
don't you think?

87
00:10:02.857 --> 00:10:06.152
All of this space and fresh air.

88
00:10:06.277 --> 00:10:09.823
We have a yard.
It's really great.

89
00:10:18.456 --> 00:10:21.292
Listen, honey...

90
00:10:25.547 --> 00:10:27.507
...we didn't do anything wrong.

91
00:10:29.342 --> 00:10:32.428
We did what anyone would do.

92
00:10:34.347 --> 00:10:37.016
We started over.

93
00:10:51.865 --> 00:10:54.993
- [knocking]
- Yeah.

94
00:10:56.369 --> 00:10:59.205
- Hey.
- Hey.

95
00:11:00.206 --> 00:11:03.793
Uh, you know how they can tell
you used to work at a real newspaper?

96
00:11:03.877 --> 00:11:06.212
You're the only one
who closes your door.

97
00:11:06.296 --> 00:11:08.464
Habit.

98
00:11:12.594 --> 00:11:15.972
Uh, I wanted to talk
to you about my editorial.

99
00:11:16.055 --> 00:11:18.308
Those changes OK?

100
00:11:18.391 --> 00:11:21.895
Well, I asked you to copy edit it
and you rewrote it.

101
00:11:21.978 --> 00:11:24.189
Just the part
about the bond measure.

102
00:11:24.272 --> 00:11:25.773
That was the whole thing.

103
00:11:25.815 --> 00:11:28.693
The bridge would get
the money, not the riverfront.

104
00:11:29.402 --> 00:11:31.988
Yeah. Uh...

105
00:11:32.071 --> 00:11:34.574
Rachel. [clears throat]

106
00:11:34.657 --> 00:11:36.534
You know,
a big news day in Astoria

107
00:11:36.618 --> 00:11:40.705
is a school board meeting, a car wreck
and a cat in a tree. That's big news.

108
00:11:40.788 --> 00:11:44.584
You sure this is the job
you're looking for?

109
00:11:44.667 --> 00:11:47.503
Well, I'm around for my son more.

110
00:11:47.587 --> 00:11:49.255
In Seattle, I wasn't.

111
00:11:50.882 --> 00:11:52.842
Good a reason as any.

112
00:11:52.926 --> 00:11:56.387
I'm glad to see you're
settling in. I like the...

113
00:11:56.471 --> 00:11:57.972
Max, while you're here,

114
00:11:58.056 --> 00:12:01.017
have you given any thought
to that piece for tomorrow?

115
00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.061
You know what?
Don't worry about it.

116
00:12:03.144 --> 00:12:04.979
[door shuts]

117
00:12:05.063 --> 00:12:08.399
[man on radio]
It's 442 Ridgecrest.

118
00:12:08.483 --> 00:12:10.693
[woman on radio] Repeat that.
It's what?

119
00:12:10.777 --> 00:12:13.571
[man] Ridgecrest. Ridgecrest!

120
00:12:13.655 --> 00:12:16.866
I've talked to the medical
examiner. They're on their way.

121
00:12:16.908 --> 00:12:18.826
[man #2] Squad 19 to respond.

122
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:21.204
[woman] Can we keep
this channel clear?

123
00:12:21.287 --> 00:12:23.915
- The police found a body.
- Possible homicide.

124
00:12:23.998 --> 00:12:27.335
- Please, we should be so lucky.
- What are they saying?

125
00:12:27.377 --> 00:12:32.006
"High school student, male, 17.
Address, 442 Ridgecrest.

126
00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:35.551
Found the house flooded,
a girlfriend hiding in the basement."

127
00:12:35.635 --> 00:12:39.764
- Suspect or witness, they don't know.
- The guy was dead in front of the TV.

128
00:12:39.847 --> 00:12:43.226
[man] They keep on talking
about his face.

129
00:12:43.309 --> 00:12:45.561
What about his face?

130
00:12:45.645 --> 00:12:49.732
[woman on radio] All emergency units,
area Astoria, switch to Tack Five.

131
00:12:49.816 --> 00:12:52.860
[indistinct radio chatter]

132
00:12:57.448 --> 00:12:59.909
[car approaching]

133
00:13:05.373 --> 00:13:07.625
[woman] Detective.

134
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.962
Detective, you have a minute?
Was it homicide or wasn't it?

135
00:13:11.045 --> 00:13:12.588
You know how he died.

136
00:13:24.892 --> 00:13:27.020
[man] I just have
a few last questions.

137
00:13:27.103 --> 00:13:30.106
If you could walk me
through it again.

138
00:14:02.847 --> 00:14:06.100
[woman] It's just horrible.
80 young.

139
00:14:47.975 --> 00:14:50.186
[gasping]

140
00:14:51.437 --> 00:14:54.399
[breathing nervously]

141
00:14:57.443 --> 00:14:59.529
[crying] No.

142
00:15:00.613 --> 00:15:04.992
No, please, not here.

143
00:15:05.076 --> 00:15:08.121
[men chattering]

144
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:22.218
[whimpering]

145
00:15:22.301 --> 00:15:23.928
[girl] I found you.

146
00:15:24.011 --> 00:15:25.596
[hissing]

147
00:15:25.638 --> 00:15:28.850
[grunting, panting]

148
00:15:42.405 --> 00:15:45.700
We only made one copy.

149
00:15:47.493 --> 00:15:50.913
Oh, God.

150
00:15:57.712 --> 00:16:00.006
- Excuse me, sir.
- Hold on.

151
00:16:00.047 --> 00:16:01.549
<i>—</i> Yeah?

152
00:16:01.632 --> 00:16:05.136
- Rachel Keller from the Daily Astorian.
- We'll make a statement.

153
00:16:05.219 --> 00:16:08.181
- I need to know about the girl.
- We'll make a statement.

154
00:16:08.264 --> 00:16:10.099
She hasn't said a word, has she?

155
00:16:10.933 --> 00:16:14.437
You're welcome to wait.
Excuse me.

156
00:16:17.398 --> 00:16:20.193
[man] Watch your step.
Have a seat here, OK?

157
00:16:20.276 --> 00:16:23.237
Have a seat.
I just want you to relax for me.

158
00:16:23.321 --> 00:16:24.864
[man #2] You can't keep her.

159
00:16:24.947 --> 00:16:28.034
- [man #1] Focus on the walls.
- [man #2] We wanna take her.

160
00:16:28.117 --> 00:16:30.786
- [woman] She'll talk to us.
- [man #1] I understand.

161
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:33.372
I'm just gonna ask
a few questions. Please.

162
00:16:33.414 --> 00:16:36.834
- Be right back, Emily.
- Thank you. Thank you.

163
00:16:36.918 --> 00:16:40.838
All right. Give me his number.
Yeah. All right.

164
00:16:54.852 --> 00:16:57.021
Emily.

165
00:16:57.855 --> 00:17:01.984
Emily, listen to me.
I know what happened.

166
00:17:02.068 --> 00:17:03.653
I know.

167
00:17:03.736 --> 00:17:06.948
Now, you have to tell me.
The tape.

168
00:17:10.368 --> 00:17:12.828
Did you watch it?

169
00:17:15.248 --> 00:17:18.626
Do you know who else
has watched it?

170
00:17:19.835 --> 00:17:23.464
Has anyone else watched it?

171
00:17:25.258 --> 00:17:26.551
Then where is it?

172
00:17:26.592 --> 00:17:30.638
Hey, you.
Get away from her. Ray.

173
00:17:30.721 --> 00:17:34.183
Emily, talk to me.

174
00:17:34.267 --> 00:17:36.185
[man] I want her out of here.
Now.

175
00:17:36.269 --> 00:17:39.021
You can tell me, Emily.

176
00:20:18.806 --> 00:20:22.643
[hissing]

177
00:20:22.727 --> 00:20:25.312

No.

00:20:28.399 --> 00:20:32.153
[panting] Not here, Samara.

180
00:20:32.194 --> 00:20:34.280
Not here.

181

Rachel?

187
00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:47.686

Rachel! Rachel!

195
00:22:44.034 --> 00:22:46.036
Honey, what is it?

196
00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.414
- What's wrong? Huh?
- [panting]

197
00:22:48.539 --> 00:22:51.083
Look at me. Shh.

198
00:22:51.166 --> 00:22:54.628
- OK? What is it?
- I had a nightmare.

199
00:22:54.753 --> 00:22:59.049
That's all right.
We all have them.

200
00:23:00.676 --> 00:23:04.013
Oh, God, you're soaked.
And you're freezing.

201
00:23:04.138 --> 00:23:07.308
Let's get you out of
these clothes. Come on.

202
00:23:07.391 --> 00:23:08.767
Aidan?

203
00:23:09.476 --> 00:23:11.979
What happened in your nightmare?

204
00:23:15.357 --> 00:23:19.987
I woke up and you weren't here.
You weren't here.

205
00:23:21.405 --> 00:23:25.701
I'm here now, honey.
I'm right here, OK?

206
00:23:27.578 --> 00:23:29.330
Listen.

207
00:23:29.413 --> 00:23:33.417
All you have to do is call my
name and I'll follow your voice.

208
00:23:34.418 --> 00:23:36.962
OK?

209
00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:42.384
Even if I have to come right down
into that nightmare with you.

210
00:23:43.761 --> 00:23:45.679
So tell me what happened.

211
00:23:48.474 --> 00:23:50.643
Hmm?

212
00:23:50.726 --> 00:23:52.186
I don't remember.

213
00:23:53.062 --> 00:23:54.480
You don't remember?

214
00:23:55.522 --> 00:23:57.524
I don't remember.

- [kids laughing]

217
00:24:32.059 --> 00:24:33.560
[Rachel] Aidan.

218
00:24:40.359 --> 00:24:42.194
Aidan.

219
00:24:46.073 --> 00:24:49.326
Honey. You heard me?

220
00:24:49.451 --> 00:24:51.328
I've been calling your name.

221
00:24:52.496 --> 00:24:54.790
I'm... sorry.

222
00:24:56.458 --> 00:24:59.294
- You ready to go?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

223
00:25:02.631 --> 00:25:04.425
OK.

224
00:25:45.966 --> 00:25:48.635
[people chattering]

225
00:26:02.066 --> 00:26:05.235
[Rachel] So we'll just swing by
and see what they have, OK?

226
00:26:05.319 --> 00:26:08.572
And you can keep a watch on
the backyard stuff. How's that?

227
00:26:13.494 --> 00:26:17.331
Look at all this stuff.
Who do you think buys this crap?

228
00:26:18.874 --> 00:26:21.001
[Aidan] Rachel.

229
00:26:21.085 --> 00:26:22.878
Sorry.

230
00:26:24.671 --> 00:26:27.466
What's wrong, honey?
You all right? Huh?

231
00:26:27.549 --> 00:26:28.842
Mm-hmm.

232
00:26:28.926 --> 00:26:31.678
I'm just a little cold, Rachel.

233
00:26:31.762 --> 00:26:35.599
- I'm gonna take a look around.
- All right.

234
00:26:36.517 --> 00:26:38.602
Stay close.

235
00:26:40.312 --> 00:26:42.272

[man] You gotta wait
for the whistle.

249
00:28:45.187 --> 00:28:49.191

[carnival music playing]

259
00:30:24.411 --> 00:30:25.996
Are you in there?

260
00:30:26.872 --> 00:30:28.832
Aidan?

261
00:30:34.755 --> 00:30:37.799
Why didn't you answer me, honey?
What are you...?

262
00:30:38.759 --> 00:30:40.093
Jesus.

263
00:30:40.135 --> 00:30:44.181
Jesus, you're freezing, honey.
What's going on? Are you sick?

264
00:30:44.264 --> 00:30:45.891
Talk to me, honey.

265
00:30:45.974 --> 00:30:48.643
Talk to me. What's going on?

266
00:30:48.727 --> 00:30:51.897
- What is it?
- I'm cold.

267
00:30:56.777 --> 00:31:00.280
It's OK. It's OK.

268
00:31:12.042 --> 00:31:15.754
Honey, when did this start?

269
00:31:15.837 --> 00:31:17.964
Was it last night,

270
00:31:18.048 --> 00:31:20.217
or this morning?

271
00:31:21.343 --> 00:31:23.512
I don't remember.

272
00:31:23.637 --> 00:31:26.473
I know you don't like me prying,
but this is important.

273
00:31:28.892 --> 00:31:31.520
Was it your nightmare?

274
00:31:31.603 --> 00:31:33.522
I really don't remember, Rachel.

275
00:31:33.605 --> 00:31:35.774
I need you to try.

276
00:31:37.234 --> 00:31:40.821
You're sick, all right? And we
need to know what started it.

277
00:31:40.904 --> 00:31:43.031
Aidan.

278
00:31:47.911 --> 00:31:50.038
Was she in your nightmare?

- What's the matter, honey?

"Don't stop."

294
00:33:15.165 --> 00:33:18.084
You said, "Don't stop."

[deer grunting]

296
00:33:56.248 --> 00:33:58.166

298
00:34:22.941 --> 00:34:26.236
OK. Let's see.

299
00:34:30.574 --> 00:34:32.242
That's impossible.

300
00:34:34.035 --> 00:34:36.371
Rachel...

301
00:34:37.247 --> 00:34:38.832
...what's happening?

302
00:34:43.962 --> 00:34:45.797
[Rachel] Yeah, hi, um...

303
00:34:45.922 --> 00:34:47.841
My son is very sick

304
00:34:47.966 --> 00:34:50.218
and I'd like to
talk to someone who...

305
00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:58.184
Well, it's his temperature.
It's... it's five degrees low.

306
00:35:25.128 --> 00:35:28.965
Yeah. Well, then,
I'll hold for the on-call nurse.

307
00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.177
[clicks]

308
00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:34.012
Hello?

309
00:35:34.721 --> 00:35:36.181
Hello?

00:36:05.794 --> 00:36:07.379
Aidan?

312
00:36:07.462 --> 00:36:10.965
Honey, the power just went out.
Are you OK up there?

313
00:36:15.345 --> 00:36:17.055
Aidan?

314
00:36:21.059 --> 00:36:23.812
Honey, this shouldn't be open.

315
00:36:23.937 --> 00:36:25.313
God.

316
00:36:26.189 --> 00:36:29.734
[scratching]

317
00:36:42.038 --> 00:36:45.208
Aidan, let's go. Get out of bed.

318
00:36:49.629 --> 00:36:52.924
Aidan, what are you
doing over there?

319
00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:57.721
Get back in bed right now.

320
00:36:57.804 --> 00:37:00.682
I saw something.

321
00:37:02.392 --> 00:37:06.646
- [crackling]
- [rumbling]

322
00:37:12.193 --> 00:37:14.237
Aidan...

323
00:37:14.279 --> 00:37:17.532
Move! Get away.
Get away from there.

324
00:37:18.366 --> 00:37:21.119
Honey, let's go. Come on.

325
00:37:27.542 --> 00:37:29.961
- [Aidan] I saw it.
- [Rachel panting]

326
00:37:30.044 --> 00:37:33.256
- I saw it in my head.
- Let's go.

327
00:37:47.228 --> 00:37:51.024
[fog horn blaring]

328
00:37:54.611 --> 00:37:56.404
[people chattering]

329
00:37:56.488 --> 00:37:58.573
Oh, Miss Keller...

330
00:37:58.656 --> 00:38:01.910
- About my story. I...
- Not now.

331
00:38:12.378 --> 00:38:17.342
Now, listen, sweetie.
Last night I found a tape.

332
00:38:17.425 --> 00:38:19.385
It was one of hers.

333
00:38:19.469 --> 00:38:22.806
And I made it so we'd never
have to see it again.

334
00:38:24.682 --> 00:38:28.019
But if she knows that,

335
00:38:28.102 --> 00:38:31.523
what I did might
make her wanna hurt us.

336
00:38:31.606 --> 00:38:36.402
Am I right?
Do you know something, honey?

337
00:38:36.486 --> 00:38:39.531
Look, if you know why she's here,
you have to tell me.

338
00:38:39.614 --> 00:38:42.116
Aidan...

339
00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:44.953
...is she here to hurt you?

340
00:38:46.663 --> 00:38:48.706
Honey.

341
00:38:56.673 --> 00:38:58.424
[whispering] She can hear us.

342
00:39:01.511 --> 00:39:03.721
She hears everything.

343
00:39:05.306 --> 00:39:08.643
Except when we sleep.

344
00:39:08.726 --> 00:39:10.937
She can't hear us
when we sleep?

345
00:39:11.771 --> 00:39:14.816
What does that mean?

346
00:39:14.941 --> 00:39:17.318
We have to sleep.

347
00:39:17.402 --> 00:39:19.445
[knocking]

348
00:39:19.529 --> 00:39:22.699
[Max] Rachel,
may I come in, please?

349
00:39:22.782 --> 00:39:24.617
Yeah.

350
00:39:27.662 --> 00:39:29.789
What happened to your car?

351
00:39:29.873 --> 00:39:31.875
Your car. Apparently it's wrecked.

352
00:39:31.916 --> 00:39:35.545
- Are you guys OK?
- Yeah. We got hit.

353
00:39:35.628 --> 00:39:37.881
[Max] And no one's hurt?

354
00:39:37.964 --> 00:39:40.592
That's good.

355
00:39:40.675 --> 00:39:44.387
Aidan, right? Hi, I'm Max.

356
00:39:46.097 --> 00:39:48.975
- Is he all right?
- He's sick.

357
00:39:49.058 --> 00:39:50.935
How sick?

358
00:39:56.316 --> 00:39:59.235
Max,

359
00:39:59.319 --> 00:40:01.279
I need your help.

360
00:40:36.022 --> 00:40:37.565
Here.

361
00:40:37.607 --> 00:40:39.651
I'll get some more blankets.

362
00:40:39.734 --> 00:40:42.737
The house is yours if there's
anything you need at all.

363
00:40:42.779 --> 00:40:44.989
[Rachel] OK. Thanks.

364
00:40:45.073 --> 00:40:46.824
- Here.
- Thank you.

365
00:40:46.908 --> 00:40:49.827
- Shouldn't he be at a hospital?
- No, he's fine.

366
00:40:49.911 --> 00:40:51.120
The bath?

367
00:40:51.204 --> 00:40:53.957
Just down the hall.
I'll get it started.

368
00:40:55.083 --> 00:40:56.834
Honey.

369
00:40:58.544 --> 00:41:01.047
I'm gonna go home
and get some of our things.

370
00:41:01.631 --> 00:41:06.010
Then we'll leave here
and never come back, OK?

371
00:41:10.014 --> 00:41:11.891
[Rachel] Let's get you warmed up.

372
00:41:11.975 --> 00:41:14.644
Not the best water pressure,
but it works.

373
00:41:14.727 --> 00:41:17.480
It's good, thanks.
I don't know why we lost power.

374
00:41:17.563 --> 00:41:18.815
The block seemed fine.

375
00:41:18.898 --> 00:41:21.901
I have plenty of candles
in case the problem spreads.

376
00:41:21.985 --> 00:41:24.028
Go ahead and get in.
Get you warmed up.

377
00:41:24.112 --> 00:41:26.656
Max, I just need
to go back to my house,

378
00:41:26.739 --> 00:41:28.950
get a few things,
some medicine.

379
00:41:29.033 --> 00:41:30.910
Do you mind if you could...?

380
00:41:30.994 --> 00:41:33.413
- I'll watch him. Of course.
- OK, thanks.

381
00:41:33.496 --> 00:41:36.332
Honey, go ahead and get in.
Let's go. Let's go.

382
00:41:38.042 --> 00:41:40.962
We need to raise your temperature.
Now, let's get in.

383
00:41:41.045 --> 00:41:44.215
Aidan, what's wrong?
It's just water.

384
00:41:44.298 --> 00:41:47.760
- We need to raise your temperature...
- I don't want to, Rachel.

385
00:41:47.844 --> 00:41:50.263
Do you want me
to get in with you?

386
00:41:50.346 --> 00:41:54.142
Let's go then.
Aidan. Come on, let's go.

387
00:41:54.976 --> 00:41:56.936
That's it.

388
00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:00.023
Come on, honey.
Let's go. Let's go.

389
00:42:00.106 --> 00:42:02.400
That's it. That's it.

390
00:42:03.484 --> 00:42:05.486
That's better, right?

391
00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:09.365
See? It's nice and warm.

392
00:42:09.449 --> 00:42:12.994
It's OK. Just relax.

393
00:42:36.934 --> 00:42:38.478
[wailing]

394
00:44:11.154 --> 00:44:14.657
[water pouring]

395
00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:16.951
[phone ringing]

396
00:44:23.332 --> 00:44:25.126
[Max] Hello?

397
00:44:25.209 --> 00:44:28.629
Officer Ray. How you doing?

398
00:44:28.754 --> 00:44:32.300
Yeah, good, good. All right,
what do you got for me?

399
00:44:32.383 --> 00:44:35.303
Mm-hmm. Right.

400
00:44:35.344 --> 00:44:37.555
Yeah. Yeah.

401
00:44:37.638 --> 00:44:40.850
Yeah, well, that all
sounds like page 26.

402
00:44:40.933 --> 00:44:43.102
You don't have any headlines?

403
00:44:44.145 --> 00:44:46.105
No?

404
00:44:46.189 --> 00:44:48.566
Well, business is business.

405
00:44:48.649 --> 00:44:51.986
Yeah. No, no, I'm good.
Real good.

406
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:54.822
Could you do me a little favour
while I've got you?

407
00:44:54.906 --> 00:44:57.241
Could you look into
your accident reports

408
00:44:57.325 --> 00:45:00.494
and see if there was an accident
with a woman and her son?

409
00:45:00.578 --> 00:45:02.705
"K" for Keller.

410
00:45:02.788 --> 00:45:05.416
No, no, I'm just trying
to get a story straight.

411
00:45:05.499 --> 00:45:07.460
[door squeaks shut]

412
00:45:07.543 --> 00:45:09.003
Ray?

413
00:45:09.086 --> 00:45:11.797
Ray, let me call you right back. OK.

414
00:45:16.969 --> 00:45:18.721
[knocking]

415
00:45:18.846 --> 00:45:21.557
Everything OK in there?

416
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:31.400
Uh, Aidan, could you, uh,
unlock the door, please?

417
00:45:31.484 --> 00:45:34.820
[knocking] Aidan, can you hear me?

418
00:45:51.629 --> 00:45:53.673
Aidan, please, unlock the door!

419
00:45:53.756 --> 00:45:55.091
Aidan, open the door!

420
00:45:55.925 --> 00:45:58.261
Aidan. Aidan. Aidan!

421
00:45:58.344 --> 00:46:00.805
He's in the bath.
It was open a second ago.

422
00:46:00.888 --> 00:46:03.975
- Aidan, open the door!
- I'll get something to break it.

423
00:46:04.058 --> 00:46:06.978
Aidan, open up the door.
I'm right here.

424
00:46:07.061 --> 00:46:09.146
Honey, can you hear me? Please.

425
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:11.315
You need to open up the door.

426
00:46:11.399 --> 00:46:13.025
Aidan!

427
00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:17.905
Aidan.

428
00:46:17.989 --> 00:46:19.991
Aidan.

429
00:46:20.992 --> 00:46:22.660
Oh, my God.

430
00:46:31.877 --> 00:46:33.129
Aidan!

431
00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:34.463
Aidan.

432
00:46:34.547 --> 00:46:37.008
Please, honey, open the...

433
00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:44.974
Oh, my God.

434
00:46:51.689 --> 00:46:53.316
Oh!

435
00:46:53.399 --> 00:46:55.276
Aidan.

436
00:46:59.572 --> 00:47:02.700
Aidan. Aidan.

437
00:47:02.783 --> 00:47:06.120
Look at me. Aidan, look at me.
Look at me.

438
00:47:25.348 --> 00:47:27.683
[coughing]

439
00:47:33.064 --> 00:47:34.357
Mommy!

440
00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:36.025
[shrieks]

441
00:47:47.328 --> 00:47:49.663
[Max] Rachel, no!

442
00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:53.626
[coughing]

443
00:47:53.709 --> 00:47:55.836
Baby. Oh.

444
00:47:57.755 --> 00:48:00.800
Oh, my God.
Baby, I'm sorry.

445
00:48:02.843 --> 00:48:06.013
It wasn't him. It wasn't him.

446
00:48:06.097 --> 00:48:07.890
I was just trying to help.

447
00:48:07.973 --> 00:48:11.936
OK, Rachel, let's just
get him out of there.

448
00:48:19.443 --> 00:48:22.530
Why is she doing this to me?

449
00:48:22.613 --> 00:48:23.989
I'm here now, baby.

450
00:48:24.073 --> 00:48:27.076
- Why is she doing this to me?
- It's OK, Aidan.

451
00:48:27.159 --> 00:48:29.912
- We're gonna get you to a hospital.
- No!

452
00:48:29.954 --> 00:48:32.081
- They can't do anything.
- [coughing]

453
00:48:32.164 --> 00:48:34.500
You asked for help,
you're gonna get help.

454
00:48:34.583 --> 00:48:36.377
He gets to a hospital. Now.

455
00:48:47.555 --> 00:48:50.391
[crying]

456
00:48:55.438 --> 00:48:58.274
[man] We're working to raise
his core temperature.

457
00:48:58.357 --> 00:49:00.317
He was at 90 degrees
when he came in.

458
00:49:00.401 --> 00:49:05.823
- He wasn't outside overnight?
- No. He was at home with me.

459
00:49:05.906 --> 00:49:09.285
A body doesn't develop
severe hypothermia on its own.

460
00:49:09.368 --> 00:49:13.247
Whatever the cause, he's fighting it.
Seems like he's stabilizing.

461
00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:16.834
- And he's just sleeping now?
- Right.

462
00:49:16.917 --> 00:49:19.837
And having some kind of dream.

463
00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:39.398
What's the story, Rachel?

464
00:49:41.567 --> 00:49:45.112
They stabilized his temperature.

465
00:49:45.196 --> 00:49:47.615
I mean the story
with you and Aidan.

466
00:49:47.698 --> 00:49:49.825
You seem awfully hard on him.

467
00:49:55.372 --> 00:49:59.585
Look, I know
it's a stressful time for you.

468
00:49:59.627 --> 00:50:02.922
Moving. It's a whole new life.

469
00:50:03.964 --> 00:50:06.967
Maybe you should tell me.

470
00:50:11.263 --> 00:50:15.893
All I ever tried to do for him
was the right thing,

471
00:50:16.018 --> 00:50:18.479
and it only ever
made things worse.

472
00:50:18.562 --> 00:50:21.815
Then it wasn't
the right thing, was it?

473
00:50:38.582 --> 00:50:40.876
[Rachel] What do you see?

474
00:50:44.713 --> 00:50:46.799
Well, it's Aidan.

475
00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:52.012
- Is that a girl there?
- Why is she in the picture?

476
00:50:52.096 --> 00:50:55.057
- Why? How would I know?
- Why is she in all of them?

477
00:50:57.935 --> 00:51:00.145
Her name's Samara.

478
00:51:01.522 --> 00:51:06.026
She was murdered by her mother.
Left to die at the bottom of a well.

479
00:51:07.278 --> 00:51:10.531
- Wait, she's... she's who?
- She didn't die.

480
00:51:10.614 --> 00:51:15.452
At least, not her ghost.
I kept it alive for Aidan.

481
00:51:15.536 --> 00:51:18.664
I let it out,
it spread and then we ran.

482
00:51:18.747 --> 00:51:22.876
- What are you talking about?
- I know this sounds crazy,

483
00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:27.381
but she's here now.
She's found us.

484
00:51:27.464 --> 00:51:29.592
And I thought it was
just to hurt Aidan,

485
00:51:29.675 --> 00:51:33.429
but it's more than that.
She wants to be him.

486
00:51:33.512 --> 00:51:37.182
And she wants to live
for real this time.

487
00:51:44.648 --> 00:51:48.652
You tell me, who can help me?

488
00:51:49.361 --> 00:51:52.364
- Who?
- I'm sure there's a rational...

489
00:51:52.448 --> 00:51:55.117
You take his picture
and tell me why she's in it.

490
00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:57.453
- Rachel.
- You take his picture.

491
00:51:57.536 --> 00:52:01.290
It's proof that he's what?
He's got a ghost inside him?

492
00:52:01.373 --> 00:52:05.294
No. The proof
is what will happen.

493
00:52:16.096 --> 00:52:17.222
[Rachel] Aidan,

494
00:52:17.306 --> 00:52:21.435
you said Samara
couldn't hear us when we sleep.

495
00:52:22.728 --> 00:52:25.356
Well, you're sleeping now.

496
00:52:28.108 --> 00:52:30.986
Tell me how to stop her, honey.

497
00:52:32.237 --> 00:52:34.156
Tell me how to help you.

498
00:52:34.239 --> 00:52:37.326
Just tell me,
I'll do anything, I swear.

499
00:52:52.466 --> 00:52:54.885
[gasping]

500
00:53:00.307 --> 00:53:04.144
- [woman singing softly]
- [low rumbling]

501
00:53:04.228 --> 00:53:07.898
[electronic whirring]

502
00:53:08.023 --> 00:53:11.735
[woman singing softly]

503
00:53:25.833 --> 00:53:27.626
[woman screaming]

504
00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:31.505
[high-pitched scream]

505
00:53:34.174 --> 00:53:36.552
[grinding]

506
00:53:37.678 --> 00:53:41.306
[breathing heavily]

507
00:53:48.564 --> 00:53:50.607
Aidan?

508
00:53:52.151 --> 00:53:54.820
- Aidan?
- Miss Keller?

509
00:53:57.239 --> 00:53:59.992
Hello, I'm Dr Emma Temple.

510
00:54:00.075 --> 00:54:04.371
I'm a consulting physician
at County Child Services.

511
00:54:04.455 --> 00:54:07.374
Well, I was hoping to speak
with Aidan when he wakes up.

512
00:54:10.461 --> 00:54:13.005
Is everything all right in here?

513
00:54:13.088 --> 00:54:15.591
Yeah. It's fine. Thank you.

514
00:54:15.674 --> 00:54:18.385
[Dr Temple] I was hoping
to speak with you as well.

515
00:54:18.469 --> 00:54:23.640
It's Rachel, isn't it?
Yeah, about his situation.

516
00:54:23.724 --> 00:54:27.186
[Rachel] Sorry, what kind
of doctor did you say you were again?

517
00:54:27.311 --> 00:54:28.729
I'm a psychiatrist.

518
00:54:28.812 --> 00:54:33.942
Yeah. I spoke with a Dr, um...

519
00:54:34.026 --> 00:54:36.904
...Koji in Seattle. Aidan's doctor.

520
00:54:36.945 --> 00:54:39.490
Look, if we could
maybe talk later.

521
00:54:39.573 --> 00:54:45.162
Right. Um, Dr Koji mentioned
that you dealt with some PPD

522
00:54:45.245 --> 00:54:47.372
when Aidan was born.

523
00:54:47.456 --> 00:54:48.957
Postpartum depression.

524
00:54:49.041 --> 00:54:51.126
That was the first month.
That's all.

525
00:54:51.251 --> 00:54:53.629
I understand. It's very common.

526
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:57.966
I mean, a lot of women have trouble
adapting to the stresses of motherhood.

527
00:54:58.050 --> 00:55:02.638
What does this have to do with
what's going on with my son right now?

528
00:55:02.763 --> 00:55:06.183
Have you been
under stress lately?

529
00:55:06.266 --> 00:55:09.853
Have you ever found that you were...

530
00:55:09.937 --> 00:55:13.315
...unable to experience love for Aidan?

531
00:55:13.398 --> 00:55:17.027
- What?
- Have you hurt him,

532
00:55:17.110 --> 00:55:18.654
however unintentionally?

533
00:55:18.695 --> 00:55:21.490
Have you left him alone?
Abandoned him?

534
00:55:21.573 --> 00:55:25.577
I'd like to be with my son,
please, if you don't mind.

535
00:55:27.621 --> 00:55:29.998
Yeah, of course.

536
00:55:31.166 --> 00:55:33.502
I'm sorry, Rachel.

537
00:55:34.711 --> 00:55:36.630
[beeping]

538
00:55:36.713 --> 00:55:38.340
Until we can talk further,

539
00:55:38.423 --> 00:55:42.219
I cannot let you be alone with him.

540
00:55:43.387 --> 00:55:44.805
I'm his mother.

541
00:55:46.265 --> 00:55:49.476
There are bruises on his body.

542
00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:52.604
He was hypothermic
and very near death.

543
00:55:52.688 --> 00:55:54.982
That is not because of me.

544
00:55:59.361 --> 00:56:02.072
[Dr Temple] He's gonna
be all right. He will.

545
00:56:02.197 --> 00:56:04.533
But you need to leave.

546
00:56:04.616 --> 00:56:06.910
Now, please.

547
00:56:12.708 --> 00:56:16.044
[whispering] You can't have him,
Samara.

548
00:56:16.128 --> 00:56:19.965
You're going back
to where you came from.

549
00:56:45.532 --> 00:56:48.785
All I wanna know is what her
history was before the Morgans.

550
00:56:48.869 --> 00:56:51.371
I'm sorry, but the
privacy laws still apply.

551
00:56:51.455 --> 00:56:55.626
Well, was she really adopted?
Can you at least tell me that much?

552
00:56:55.667 --> 00:56:59.046
- Was their story true?
- Samara Morgan was adopted, yes.

553
00:56:59.129 --> 00:57:01.924
But you won't tell me from who?

554
00:57:02.007 --> 00:57:05.344
- I'd lose my job if I did.
- [sighing] Look, ma'am,

555
00:57:05.427 --> 00:57:09.306
my son has a medical condition
that his doctors don't even understand.

556
00:57:09.389 --> 00:57:11.642
This little girl
had the same condition.

557
00:57:11.725 --> 00:57:16.063
Now, if I knew what caused that,
it could save his life.

558
00:57:16.188 --> 00:57:20.192
[woman] All I can say is you
should speak to the Morgans.

559
00:57:20.275 --> 00:57:24.196
They're dead.
They both killed themselves.

560
00:58:55.454 --> 00:58:58.665
Whoa! Look out. Early birds.

561
00:58:58.707 --> 00:59:01.001
Marty Savide,
Stevens Northwest Realty.

562
00:59:01.084 --> 00:59:03.503
- Hi.
- Uh, come in.

563
00:59:03.628 --> 00:59:07.007
I thought I put 12.30 on the ad.
For the open house.

564
00:59:07.090 --> 00:59:09.718
- How'd you get around the gate?
- Well, I just...

565
00:59:09.843 --> 00:59:11.470
Ah! Who cares? Come on.

566
00:59:11.553 --> 00:59:15.474
Make me an offer
over asking and it's yours.

567
00:59:15.557 --> 00:59:18.351
OK, then, don't mind me.

568
00:59:18.435 --> 00:59:22.773
My first try with these things,
took off flying. [chuckling]

569
00:59:23.607 --> 00:59:25.609
There we go.

570
00:59:25.692 --> 00:59:27.611
What do you think?

571
00:59:27.694 --> 00:59:31.782
Um, a little colour will really
turn the place around.

572
00:59:31.865 --> 00:59:33.658
It's got a wonderful history.

573
00:59:33.742 --> 00:59:35.786
Working horse ranch.
How about that?

574
00:59:35.911 --> 00:59:40.791
And there's even this cute little
tree house thing way up in the barn.

575
00:59:40.874 --> 00:59:45.504
Um, is the place being
sold unfurnished or...?

576
00:59:45.587 --> 00:59:48.256
The previous owners
didn't leave anything behind?

577
00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:53.929
Well, there were some things
that were left, after they...

578
00:59:54.012 --> 00:59:55.222
...moved.

579
00:59:55.305 --> 00:59:57.891
We're storing all that
in the basement.

580
00:59:57.974 --> 01:00:00.060
There's a basement?

581
01:00:00.143 --> 01:00:04.314
Uh... Well, you betcha.
No extra charge.

582
01:00:04.356 --> 01:00:06.441
Right this way.

583
01:00:09.069 --> 01:00:12.739
[low rumbling]

584
01:00:16.201 --> 01:00:19.162
[Savide] Uh, if you don't mind,
I'm the welcome wagon.

585
01:00:19.246 --> 01:00:21.289
Gotta open up the gate for everyone.

586
01:00:21.373 --> 01:00:23.500
So please,
just make yourself at home.

587
01:00:23.583 --> 01:00:28.130
Do you know what happened
to them? The previous owners?

588
01:00:28.213 --> 01:00:30.423
I believe they bought
a condo in Phoenix.

589
01:00:30.507 --> 01:00:31.842
Really?

590
01:02:24.621 --> 01:02:27.707
[music box music plays]

591
01:03:46.077 --> 01:03:48.830
[woman singing softly]

592
01:03:58.089 --> 01:04:00.258
Her mother.

593
01:04:04.929 --> 01:04:06.222
[gasps]

594
01:04:32.374 --> 01:04:34.626
I'll take it from here.

595
01:04:40.131 --> 01:04:43.593
Hello, Aidan, I'm Dr Temple.

596
01:04:43.676 --> 01:04:45.095
How are you feeling?

597
01:04:48.431 --> 01:04:50.558
Aidan?

598
01:04:52.227 --> 01:04:56.106
You know,
I'd really like to help you.

599
01:04:56.189 --> 01:04:59.442
Can you tell me
how you're feeling?

600
01:05:01.569 --> 01:05:03.238
Where's my mommy?

601
01:05:03.363 --> 01:05:07.617
Well, she'll be here soon.
She's on her way.

602
01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:10.286
I want Mommy.

603
01:05:10.370 --> 01:05:12.330
Yeah, I know you do.

604
01:05:12.414 --> 01:05:14.707
Your mommy
wants to be with you too.

605
01:05:14.833 --> 01:05:17.544
So where is she?

606
01:05:17.627 --> 01:05:19.337
She went home.

607
01:05:19.421 --> 01:05:22.298
She didn't think that you
were gonna wake up so soon.

608
01:05:22.382 --> 01:05:24.050
I wanna go home too.

609
01:05:24.175 --> 01:05:26.511
Well, you will.

610
01:05:26.553 --> 01:05:30.640
We just have to...
We just have to get you...

611
01:05:34.477 --> 01:05:36.604
You're freezing.

612
01:05:37.897 --> 01:05:40.191
I wanna go home to Mommy.

613
01:05:42.277 --> 01:05:45.905
Well, we need to talk about her.

614
01:05:45.989 --> 01:05:48.908
Can you tell me
about Mommy a little bit?

615
01:05:50.452 --> 01:05:53.246
She loves me.

616
01:05:53.371 --> 01:05:55.373
I know that she does.

617
01:05:55.498 --> 01:06:00.086
She went looking for me.
She tried to find me.

618
01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:02.547
It means she loves me.

619
01:06:03.673 --> 01:06:05.633
I don't understand.

620
01:06:09.137 --> 01:06:10.805
Can I go home now?

621
01:06:12.807 --> 01:06:15.643
No, honey,
you're not well enough.

622
01:06:19.272 --> 01:06:21.107
Can I go home?

623
01:06:21.816 --> 01:06:23.401
No.

624
01:06:31.367 --> 01:06:33.536
I'm sorry.

625
01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:45.089
Then I have
to show you something.

626
01:07:42.605 --> 01:07:44.440
It won't stop.

627
01:07:49.946 --> 01:07:52.782
[exhales]

628
01:08:28.651 --> 01:08:32.238
[woman] I'm gonna walk you
just around the corner here.

629
01:08:46.794 --> 01:08:49.964
Her name was Evelyn.

630
01:08:50.048 --> 01:08:52.550
She came to us
eight months pregnant.

631
01:08:52.634 --> 01:08:54.469
- Did she have her baby here?
- Yes.

632
01:08:54.552 --> 01:08:56.471
And you arranged
for the adoption?

633
01:08:56.554 --> 01:08:58.222
That's right.

634
01:08:58.264 --> 01:09:02.268
- And the father?
- There was none.

635
01:09:04.062 --> 01:09:06.356
Half the mothers
that come to us say that.

636
01:09:06.439 --> 01:09:09.400
So, what did she think
got her pregnant?

637
01:09:09.484 --> 01:09:10.610
Evelyn wasn't well.

638
01:09:10.693 --> 01:09:13.488
She had been having problems
during the pregnancy:

639
01:09:13.613 --> 01:09:16.032
Hallucinations, visions.

640
01:09:16.115 --> 01:09:19.535
She believed some thing
had come for her baby

641
01:09:19.619 --> 01:09:22.121
from the waters of the world
beyond this one.

642
01:09:22.205 --> 01:09:24.415
I'm sorry. Did you say water?

643
01:09:24.499 --> 01:09:29.337
Well, we all envision
the afterlife differently.

644
01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:34.342
For Evelyn,
it's just what she believed.

645
01:09:34.467 --> 01:09:38.596
As you might imagine, she suffered
severe postpartum depression.

646
01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:41.933
She blamed her troubles
on her child.

647
01:09:42.016 --> 01:09:44.936
So she tried to kill it.

648
01:09:50.525 --> 01:09:53.444
- All babies are a challenge.
- [baby cooing]

649
01:09:53.486 --> 01:09:57.990
But Samara, she never cried.

650
01:09:58.074 --> 01:09:59.992
Never.

651
01:10:00.076 --> 01:10:02.620
Except when her mother
would try to bathe her.

652
01:10:02.704 --> 01:10:06.666
Then she'd scream like it
was the end of the world.

653
01:10:11.838 --> 01:10:13.798
It was the screaming that woke us.

654
01:10:13.881 --> 01:10:16.175
[baby screaming and crying]

655
01:10:22.223 --> 01:10:24.934
- Evelyn, don't!
- [crying continues]

656
01:10:30.148 --> 01:10:32.191
[woman] Evelyn!

657
01:10:32.275 --> 01:10:34.527
Evelyn, stop!

658
01:10:47.248 --> 01:10:49.542
[woman] She was trying
to drown the baby.

659
01:10:49.625 --> 01:10:52.003
The baby was taken from her,
of course.

660
01:10:52.086 --> 01:10:54.589
Evelyn was institutionalized.

661
01:10:54.714 --> 01:10:57.216
And all those pictures
she'd been collecting,

662
01:10:57.300 --> 01:11:00.470
they finally made sense.

663
01:11:03.723 --> 01:11:06.768
Did she say why she did it?

664
01:11:06.851 --> 01:11:10.438
She felt she had to kill
her baby to save it.

665
01:12:10.498 --> 01:12:13.042
I'm here to see a patient.
Her name's Evelyn.

666
01:12:13.125 --> 01:12:15.753
- I don't know her last name.
- Evelyn?

667
01:12:15.837 --> 01:12:17.964
That's right.

668
01:12:19.966 --> 01:12:21.843
Evelyn's expecting you.

669
01:12:21.926 --> 01:12:24.554
Every few years, one of you
comes to see Evelyn.

670
01:12:24.637 --> 01:12:27.807
She's like a freakin'
patron saint or something.

671
01:12:27.849 --> 01:12:30.643
Got a problem with your kid,
don't you?

672
01:12:30.726 --> 01:12:34.021
[woman singing softly]

673
01:12:36.524 --> 01:12:38.568
Something wrong?

674
01:12:38.651 --> 01:12:41.988
That song. I know it.

675
01:12:42.113 --> 01:12:44.115
Yeah. They all do.

676
01:12:50.621 --> 01:12:52.415
Hey, Evelyn.

677
01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:56.460
You were right as rain.
You got a visitor today.

678
01:12:56.544 --> 01:12:59.130
Hope she's some help
to your troubles.

679
01:12:59.213 --> 01:13:01.215
Ten minutes.

680
01:13:01.299 --> 01:13:04.969
- [scissors cutting]
- [woman humming]

681
01:13:07.179 --> 01:13:10.391
My name's Rachel.

682
01:13:10.474 --> 01:13:12.560
But you know that.

683
01:13:18.107 --> 01:13:21.402
[Evelyn] Some days I
sort of have a feeling.

684
01:13:22.570 --> 01:13:24.906
A feeling?

685
01:13:24.989 --> 01:13:27.742
This is about your child.

686
01:13:31.787 --> 01:13:32.830
It's...

687
01:13:35.207 --> 01:13:37.919
- It's about yours.
- [cutting stops]

688
01:13:38.002 --> 01:13:40.004
Samara.

689
01:13:47.511 --> 01:13:50.014
They don't dream, you know.

690
01:13:51.098 --> 01:13:53.267
The dead don't dream.

691
01:13:57.229 --> 01:13:59.357
Look, something's happened
to my son.

692
01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:02.610
- You have to sleep to dream.
- It has to do with your daughter.

693
01:14:02.693 --> 01:14:04.654
And the dead never sleep.

694
01:14:04.737 --> 01:14:06.030
They wait...

695
01:14:07.698 --> 01:14:10.159
...and watch for a way back.

696
01:14:12.453 --> 01:14:15.289
But they never sleep.

697
01:14:15.373 --> 01:14:18.334
- That's why dreams are safe.
- I'm sorry, I just...

698
01:14:18.376 --> 01:14:22.088
I don't have a lot of time.
Please, I need your help.

699
01:14:22.213 --> 01:14:24.382
I have to know.
Can you tell me?

700
01:14:26.050 --> 01:14:28.344
Why did you try
to kill your baby?

701
01:14:30.388 --> 01:14:32.390
Why?

702
01:14:34.016 --> 01:14:36.060
Because my baby told me to.

703
01:14:37.269 --> 01:14:39.522
Just like yours will tell you.

704
01:14:39.605 --> 01:14:42.900
And you have to do it.

705
01:14:42.984 --> 01:14:45.861
- You have to send it back.
- What?

706
01:14:51.784 --> 01:14:55.079
They stopped me.

707
01:14:55.162 --> 01:14:58.541
- Don't let them stop you.

01:34:38.970 --> 01:34:40.889
[crashing]

890
01:35:07.081 --> 01:35:08.541
Samara!

891
01:35:09.584 --> 01:35:12.045
Here I am, Samara.

892
01:35:13.963 --> 01:35:16.883
Just like you wanted.

893
01:35:19.093 --> 01:35:22.597
But you leave him alone!

894
01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:24.390
You hear me?

895
01:35:26.476 --> 01:35:28.895
[electric buzzing]

896
01:35:31.773 --> 01:35:33.566
[Samara] Help me.

897
01:35:43.201 --> 01:35:46.162
It's always open.

898
01:35:46.246 --> 01:35:50.625
Her only way out
is always open.

899
01:36:13.481 --> 01:36:18.194
[Samara muffled] Mommy.

900
01:36:29.330 --> 01:36:32.500
Mommy!

901
01:36:38.423 --> 01:36:41.384
Mommy.

902
01:36:58.276 --> 01:37:02.447
[high-pitched squeal]

903
01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:15.084
[breathing heavily]

904
01:38:19.399 --> 01:38:21.734
[panting, straining]

905
01:38:35.832 --> 01:38:39.127
- Mommy!
- I'm not your fucking mommy.

906
01:38:40.711 --> 01:38:43.256
[gasping]

907
01:39:04.944 --> 01:39:06.821
[Aidan] Rachel.

908
01:39:12.535 --> 01:39:15.913
[whirring]

909
01:39:24.255 --> 01:39:26.215
[Aidan] Rachel.

910
01:39:31.137 --> 01:39:33.097
Rachel.

911
01:40:25.316 --> 01:40:26.984
Rachel.

912
01:40:29.987 --> 01:40:31.364
Rachel.

913
01:40:31.489 --> 01:40:35.243
- Can you hear me?
- I can hear you.

914
01:40:35.326 --> 01:40:37.828
[Aidan] I'm right here.

915
01:41:06.399 --> 01:41:08.192
[silence]

916
01:41:08.276 --> 01:41:09.402
[Aidan] Rachel.

917
01:41:12.238 --> 01:41:14.365
Rachel!

918
01:41:16.492 --> 01:41:18.494
You're here.

919
01:41:20.204 --> 01:41:23.916
- You're here, Rachel.
- Of course I'm here.

920
01:41:23.958 --> 01:41:26.961
I followed your voice.

921
01:41:29.046 --> 01:41:30.923
What happened?

922
01:41:33.175 --> 01:41:35.803
It's over, honey.

923
01:41:36.804 --> 01:41:39.557
She's not coming back.

924
01:41:39.599 --> 01:41:42.435
How do you know, Rachel?

925
01:41:45.271 --> 01:41:47.440
I know.

926
01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:51.319
I promise.

927
01:41:56.407 --> 01:41:58.409
I promise.

928
01:41:58.492 --> 01:42:01.162
I love you, Mommy.

929
01:42:03.414 --> 01:42:05.666
Promise me something?

930
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:09.378
Yeah. Anything, Mom. Anything.

931
01:42:09.503 --> 01:42:11.964
Just call me Rachel.

932
01:42:13.674 --> 01:42:15.343
At least for a while.

933
01:43:00.596 --> 01:43:03.432
[whirring, hissing]
