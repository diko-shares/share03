00:00:05.794 --> 00:00:07.234
(woman sings softly)

2
00:00:11.032 --> 00:00:12.372
(wind blowing)

3
00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:44.955
- (man) Hey.
- (gasps)

4
00:01:45.026 --> 00:01:46.126
Hey.

5
00:01:49.364 --> 00:01:50.304
I wanna show you something.

6
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.200
What?

7
00:01:57.706 --> 00:01:58.866
(clears throat)

8
00:02:01.243 --> 00:02:04.083
Have you ever seen
something so scary

9
00:02:04.145 --> 00:02:06.345
that you had to show
to someone else?

10
00:02:07.216 --> 00:02:08.576
Um...

11
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.290
I mean, like, you know,
a movie or something.

12
00:02:12.153 --> 00:02:13.823
Well...

13
00:02:13.888 --> 00:02:17.458
Okay, I've got
the scariest freakin' movie
you'll ever see.

14
00:02:19.261 --> 00:02:22.161
Now... A buddy of mine
actually turned me on to it.

15
00:02:23.232 --> 00:02:25.302
And, uh,
he made me a copy.

16
00:02:25.367 --> 00:02:27.637
So... I did one for you.

17
00:02:29.103 --> 00:02:30.243
You brought me here
to watch a video?

18
00:02:31.072 --> 00:02:32.972
Well, two minutes. Okay?

19
00:02:33.041 --> 00:02:34.481
Two minutes
and it'll all be over.

20
00:02:34.543 --> 00:02:36.583
It's totally
underground stuff.

21
00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:38.909
I thought we
were gonna just...

22
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.620
No, we will. We will.

23
00:02:40.682 --> 00:02:44.992
You just gotta see this.
I'm telling you, it's...

24
00:02:45.053 --> 00:02:47.263
- How about after we...?
- No, you need to
watch it now.

25
00:02:49.224 --> 00:02:50.294
Okay?

26
00:02:55.997 --> 00:02:57.667
What's so scary about it?

27
00:03:10.111 --> 00:03:11.381
You'll see.

28
00:03:26.361 --> 00:03:27.801
(breathing heavily)

29
00:03:32.667 --> 00:03:34.967
Play it.
Just play the thing.

30
00:03:36.338 --> 00:03:37.838
Come on, I got
two minutes here, please.

31
00:04:02.196 --> 00:04:02.926
(TV static)

32
00:04:05.266 --> 00:04:06.696
(panting nervously)

33
00:04:23.251 --> 00:04:24.791
Emily, play the goddamn tape!

34
00:04:25.887 --> 00:04:27.387
(humming, hissing)

35
00:04:33.995 --> 00:04:35.325
(rumbling)

36
00:04:35.397 --> 00:04:36.827
(whining, gurgling)

37
00:04:44.038 --> 00:04:45.008
(sighs)

38
00:04:48.109 --> 00:04:49.509
(whining continues)

39
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.550
(phone ringing)

40
00:04:58.853 --> 00:05:00.393
(high-pitched
electronic whine)

41
00:05:01.823 --> 00:05:03.463
(ringing continues)

42
00:05:15.904 --> 00:05:18.344
- Hello?
- (man) Hey, man, you made it.

43
00:05:18.407 --> 00:05:20.677
I knew you'd come through.
You got somebody to watch it,
huh?

44
00:05:20.742 --> 00:05:24.682
(sighing) Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, man.

45
00:05:25.714 --> 00:05:28.984
Some stupid chick
from my school.

46
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.090
(man) Good. I was afraid
you didn't believe me, man.

47
00:05:32.153 --> 00:05:34.523
Now it's her problem.
She doesn't get someone else
to watch it in a week,

48
00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:37.389
I swear she's dead.

49
00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:39.759
So, did you tell her
what happens

50
00:05:39.828 --> 00:05:42.158
or you just gonna let her
find out for herself?

51
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.970
(water gurgling)

52
00:05:44.032 --> 00:05:45.032
(man) Jake?

53
00:05:46.568 --> 00:05:48.438
Come on, it's over, dude.

54
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.310
Jake. This isn't funny, man.

55
00:05:53.374 --> 00:05:55.914
- Jake?
- (hangs up phone)

56
00:05:55.977 --> 00:05:56.907
Emily?

57
00:06:12.527 --> 00:06:13.697
Emily!

58
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Emily!

59
00:06:21.235 --> 00:06:21.865
Emily, what the hell
did you do?

60
00:06:22.804 --> 00:06:23.974
I played it,
I just didn't look.

61
00:06:25.006 --> 00:06:26.106
(TV static)

62
00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:32.749
(static stops)

63
00:06:33.648 --> 00:06:35.178
(rumbling, hissing)

64
00:06:50.632 --> 00:06:51.802
(breathing heavily)

65
00:06:55.504 --> 00:06:56.744
(distant shout)

66
00:06:57.506 --> 00:06:58.506
(screaming)

67
00:07:02.243 --> 00:07:03.183
(humming)

68
00:07:06.548 --> 00:07:08.118
(TV static, hissing)

69
00:07:19.293 --> 00:07:21.233
(woman chuckling)

70
00:07:21.295 --> 00:07:23.055
Come on, Aidan,
let's go home.

71
00:08:17.852 --> 00:08:21.192
It was the right choice.
No question.

72
00:08:27.461 --> 00:08:30.201
Aidan, dinner's ready.

73
00:08:33.367 --> 00:08:35.037
(sighs) Damn.

74
00:08:37.538 --> 00:08:39.538
Aidan!

75
00:08:55.189 --> 00:08:59.589
Okay, now, before you say
anything, I followed
the recipe this time.

76
00:08:59.661 --> 00:09:01.301
So just 'cause it doesn't look
like the one in the magazine,

77
00:09:02.496 --> 00:09:04.796
doesn't mean to say
it won't taste good.

78
00:09:08.937 --> 00:09:11.767
Those are great, honey.
Got a really good eye.

79
00:09:18.546 --> 00:09:19.646
He'd be proud of you.

80
00:09:21.716 --> 00:09:23.046
Thanks, Rachel.

81
00:09:27.355 --> 00:09:30.155
You know, it wouldn't kill you
to call me "mom"
now and again.

82
00:09:31.159 --> 00:09:33.359
"Ma." "Mommy."

83
00:09:33.427 --> 00:09:35.197
Something besides "Rachel."

84
00:09:36.965 --> 00:09:39.065
Yeah, I like "Rachel."

85
00:09:39.133 --> 00:09:41.503
Well, "mom" has
its charms too, you know?

86
00:09:41.569 --> 00:09:43.539
But "Rachel"
is more your personality.

87
00:09:43.604 --> 00:09:44.674
Really?

88
00:09:46.007 --> 00:09:49.777
Well, Rachel
declares dinnertime.

89
00:09:58.052 --> 00:10:01.162
It's working out great,
don't you think?

90
00:10:01.222 --> 00:10:04.632
All of this space
and fresh air.

91
00:10:04.693 --> 00:10:07.133
We have a yard.
It's really great.

92
00:10:16.905 --> 00:10:18.305
Listen, honey...

93
00:10:24.078 --> 00:10:25.248
...we didn't do
anything wrong.

94
00:10:27.782 --> 00:10:29.722
We did what
anyone would do.

95
00:10:32.721 --> 00:10:34.121
We started over.

96
00:10:50.271 --> 00:10:51.441
(knocking)

97
00:10:51.505 --> 00:10:52.405
Yeah.

98
00:10:54.642 --> 00:10:56.782
- Hey.
- Hey.

99
00:10:59.347 --> 00:11:02.347
Uh, you know how they can
tell you used to work
at a real newspaper?

100
00:11:02.416 --> 00:11:04.646
You're the only one
who closes your door.

101
00:11:04.719 --> 00:11:05.889
Habit.

102
00:11:11.125 --> 00:11:14.425
Uh, I wanted to talk
to you about my editorial.

103
00:11:14.495 --> 00:11:16.995
Those changes okay?

104
00:11:17.065 --> 00:11:19.765
Well, I asked you to copy edit
it and you rewrote it.

105
00:11:20.802 --> 00:11:22.502
Well, just the part
about the bond measure.

106
00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.140
That was the whole thing.

107
00:11:24.205 --> 00:11:28.105
It's the bridge that would get
the money, not the riverfront.

108
00:11:28.176 --> 00:11:31.376
Yeah, uh... Rachel.
(clears throat)

109
00:11:33.247 --> 00:11:35.377
You know,
a big news day in Astoria

110
00:11:35.449 --> 00:11:37.989
is a school board meeting,
a car wreck
and a cat in a tree.

111
00:11:38.052 --> 00:11:39.422
That's big news.

112
00:11:39.487 --> 00:11:42.117
You sure this is the job
you're looking for?

113
00:11:43.157 --> 00:11:45.857
Well, I'm around
for my son more.

114
00:11:45.927 --> 00:11:47.057
In Seattle, I wasn't.

115
00:11:49.463 --> 00:11:50.463
Good a reason as any.

116
00:11:51.866 --> 00:11:54.836
I'm glad to see you're
settling in. I like the...

117
00:11:54.903 --> 00:11:57.113
Hey, Max, while you're here,

118
00:11:57.171 --> 00:11:59.371
have you given any thought
to that piece for tomorrow?

119
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.840
You know what?
Don't you worry about it.

120
00:12:01.976 --> 00:12:03.176
(door shuts)

121
00:12:03.244 --> 00:12:07.024
(man on radio)
It's 442 Ridgecrest.

122
00:12:07.081 --> 00:12:08.981
(woman on radio) Repeat that.
It's what?

123
00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:12.420
(man) Ridgecrest. Ridgecrest!

124
00:12:12.486 --> 00:12:14.816
I've talked
to the medical examiner.
They're on their way.

125
00:12:14.889 --> 00:12:16.829
(man #2) Squad 19 to respond.

126
00:12:16.891 --> 00:12:19.791
(woman) Squad 19, can we keep
this channel clear, please?

127
00:12:19.861 --> 00:12:22.731
- The police found a body.
- Possible homicide.

128
00:12:22.797 --> 00:12:26.627
- Please, we should
be so lucky.
- What are they saying?

129
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:30.670
"High school student,
male, 17.
Address, 442 Ridgecrest.

130
00:12:30.738 --> 00:12:34.278
Found the house partially
flooded, and a girlfriend
hiding in the basement."

131
00:12:34.342 --> 00:12:35.912
Suspect or witness,
they don't know.

132
00:12:35.977 --> 00:12:38.177
The guy was dead
right in front of the TV.

133
00:12:38.246 --> 00:12:40.846
(man) They keep on talking
about his face.

134
00:12:41.682 --> 00:12:43.952
What about his face?

135
00:12:44.018 --> 00:12:47.188
(woman on radio) All emergency
units, area Astoria,
switch to Tack Five.

136
00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:51.430
(indistinct radio chatter)

137
00:12:54.795 --> 00:12:56.255
(car approaching)

138
00:13:03.704 --> 00:13:06.514
(woman) Detective.

139
00:13:06.574 --> 00:13:09.684
Detective, you have a minute?
Was it homicide or wasn't it?

140
00:13:09.743 --> 00:13:11.253
You know how he died,
don't you?

141
00:13:24.225 --> 00:13:25.655
(man) I just have
a few last questions.

142
00:13:25.726 --> 00:13:27.526
If you could walk me
through it again.

143
00:14:01.529 --> 00:14:03.199
(woman) It's just horrible.
So young.

144
00:14:17.979 --> 00:14:19.209
(gasping)

145
00:14:25.886 --> 00:14:27.386
(breathing nervously)

146
00:14:55.383 --> 00:14:56.523
(crying) No.

147
00:14:58.953 --> 00:15:00.423
No, please, not here.

148
00:15:02.923 --> 00:15:04.333
(men chattering)

149
00:15:19.007 --> 00:15:20.237
(whimpering)

150
00:15:20.308 --> 00:15:21.638
(girl) I found you.

151
00:15:22.376 --> 00:15:23.306
(hissing)

152
00:15:24.078 --> 00:15:25.608
(grunting, panting)

153
00:15:40.894 --> 00:15:42.434
We only made one copy.

154
00:15:45.933 --> 00:15:47.703
Oh, God.

155
00:15:55.876 --> 00:15:57.576
- Excuse me, sir.
- Hold on.

156
00:15:58.546 --> 00:15:59.876
- Yeah?
- Hi.

157
00:15:59.947 --> 00:16:01.047
I'm Rachel Keller
from the Daily Astorian.

158
00:16:02.216 --> 00:16:03.746
We'll make a statement.

159
00:16:03.817 --> 00:16:05.087
I need to know about the girl.

160
00:16:05.153 --> 00:16:06.453
We'll make a statement.

161
00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.060
She hasn't said a word,
has she?

162
00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.760
You're welcome to wait.
Excuse me.

163
00:16:16.064 --> 00:16:19.274
(man) Watch your step.
Have a seat here, okay?

164
00:16:19.333 --> 00:16:22.173
Have a seat.
I just want you
to relax for me.

165
00:16:22.236 --> 00:16:24.706
(man #2) You can't
keep her here.

166
00:16:24.772 --> 00:16:26.942
- (man #1) Focus on the walls.
- (man #2) We wanna take her.

167
00:16:27.007 --> 00:16:28.437
- (woman) She'll talk to us.
- (man #1) I understand.

168
00:16:28.509 --> 00:16:31.549
I'm just gonna ask
a few questions. Please.

169
00:16:31.612 --> 00:16:33.352
- Be right back, Emily.
- Thank you. Thank you.

170
00:16:36.317 --> 00:16:38.747
All right. Give me his number.
Yeah. All right.

171
00:16:53.501 --> 00:16:54.471
Emily.

172
00:16:56.537 --> 00:17:00.107
Emily, listen to me.
I know what happened.

173
00:17:00.574 --> 00:17:02.314
I know.

174
00:17:02.376 --> 00:17:04.676
Now, you have to tell me.
The tape.

175
00:17:08.916 --> 00:17:10.346
Did you watch it?

176
00:17:14.088 --> 00:17:16.218
Do you know who else
has watched it?

177
00:17:18.526 --> 00:17:20.426
Has anyone else watched it?

178
00:17:23.797 --> 00:17:25.197
Then where is it?

179
00:17:25.266 --> 00:17:28.466
Hey, you.
Get away from her. Ray.

180
00:17:29.069 --> 00:17:32.209
Emily, talk to me.

181
00:17:32.273 --> 00:17:34.343
(man) I want her out of here.
Now.

182
00:17:34.408 --> 00:17:36.208
You can tell me, Emily.

183
00:20:17.605 --> 00:20:18.705
(hissing)

184
00:20:20.808 --> 00:20:21.838
(whining)

185
00:20:24.144 --> 00:20:24.954
No.

186
00:20:26.747 --> 00:20:28.247
(panting)

187
00:20:28.316 --> 00:20:31.446
Not here, Samara.
Not here.

188
00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.260
(whining, groaning)

189
00:20:44.565 --> 00:20:45.995
(hissing, rumbling)

190
00:20:51.204 --> 00:20:52.614
(water gurgling)

191
00:21:23.103 --> 00:21:24.043
Rachel?

192
00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:27.610
Rachel?

193
00:21:36.283 --> 00:21:37.723
(breathing heavily)

194
00:21:44.224 --> 00:21:45.394
Rachel?

195
00:22:04.311 --> 00:22:05.051
(electronic whirring)

196
00:22:07.581 --> 00:22:09.121
(breathing nervously)

197
00:22:11.952 --> 00:22:13.392
(water gurgling)

198
00:22:33.807 --> 00:22:34.777
Rachel!

199
00:22:35.409 --> 00:22:36.709
(straining)

200
00:22:37.745 --> 00:22:39.705
(muffled) Rachel! Rachel!

201
00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:41.850
Rachel! Rachel!

202
00:22:42.583 --> 00:22:43.753
Honey, what is it?

203
00:22:44.818 --> 00:22:47.088
- What's wrong? Huh?
- (panting)

204
00:22:47.154 --> 00:22:49.594
Look at me. Shh.

205
00:22:49.657 --> 00:22:51.987
- Okay? What is it?
- I had a nightmare.

206
00:22:53.393 --> 00:22:56.663
That's all right.
We all have them.

207
00:22:58.932 --> 00:23:02.872
Oh, God, you're soaked.
And you're freezing.

208
00:23:02.936 --> 00:23:05.566
Let's get you out of
these clothes. Come on.

209
00:23:05.973 --> 00:23:06.943
Aidan?

210
00:23:08.208 --> 00:23:10.608
What happened
in your nightmare?

211
00:23:14.047 --> 00:23:17.987
I woke up
and you weren't here.
You weren't here.

212
00:23:20.153 --> 00:23:23.493
I'm here now, honey.
I'm right here, okay?

213
00:23:26.059 --> 00:23:28.359
Listen.

214
00:23:28.428 --> 00:23:31.128
All you have to do
is call my name
and I'll follow your voice.

215
00:23:32.633 --> 00:23:33.733
Okay?

216
00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:40.010
Even if I have to come
right down into that
nightmare with you.

217
00:23:42.242 --> 00:23:43.612
So tell me what happened.

218
00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.120
Hmm?

219
00:23:49.016 --> 00:23:49.916
I don't remember.

220
00:23:51.318 --> 00:23:52.448
You don't remember?

221
00:23:54.154 --> 00:23:55.194
I don't remember.

222
00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:17.950
(rumbling)

223
00:24:26.687 --> 00:24:29.717
- (Rachel muffled) Aidan.
- (kids laughing)

224
00:24:30.357 --> 00:24:31.257
(Rachel) Aidan.

225
00:24:39.032 --> 00:24:39.972
Aidan.

226
00:24:44.672 --> 00:24:46.712
Honey. You heard me?

227
00:24:48.141 --> 00:24:49.041
I've been calling your name.

228
00:24:51.111 --> 00:24:52.581
I'm... sorry.

229
00:24:54.948 --> 00:24:57.118
- You ready to go?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

230
00:25:01.188 --> 00:25:02.058
Okay.

231
00:25:49.803 --> 00:25:51.273
(people chattering)

232
00:26:01.414 --> 00:26:04.084
(Rachel) So we'll just
swing by and see
what they have, okay?

233
00:26:04.151 --> 00:26:06.721
And you can keep a watch
on the backyard stuff.
How's that?

234
00:26:12.592 --> 00:26:15.062
Look at all this stuff.
Who do you think
buys this crap?

235
00:26:17.264 --> 00:26:18.634
(Aidan) Rachel.

236
00:26:19.332 --> 00:26:20.302
Sorry.

237
00:26:23.637 --> 00:26:26.037
What's wrong, honey?
You all right? Huh?

238
00:26:26.106 --> 00:26:27.406
Mm-hmm.

239
00:26:27.474 --> 00:26:29.014
I'm just a little cold,
Rachel.

240
00:26:30.811 --> 00:26:32.581
I'm gonna take a look around.

241
00:26:32.646 --> 00:26:33.946
All right.

242
00:26:35.182 --> 00:26:36.252
Stay close.

243
00:26:37.785 --> 00:26:39.345
(chattering continues)

244
00:27:17.557 --> 00:27:18.757
(low rumble)

245
00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:28.370
Would you like
a marble, ma'am?

246
00:27:28.435 --> 00:27:29.895
(chattering fades out)

247
00:27:31.671 --> 00:27:32.871
(snorts)

248
00:27:59.366 --> 00:28:00.396
(squeaking)

249
00:28:02.635 --> 00:28:03.435
(Rachel) Aidan?

250
00:28:09.042 --> 00:28:10.882
(kids yelling playfully)

251
00:28:13.646 --> 00:28:14.776
Aidan?

252
00:28:25.525 --> 00:28:26.425
Aidan.

253
00:28:30.898 --> 00:28:31.928
(faucet squeaking)

254
00:28:32.465 --> 00:28:33.765
(rumbling)

255
00:28:39.172 --> 00:28:40.242
Aidan?

256
00:28:40.307 --> 00:28:41.977
(man) You gotta wait
for the whistle.

257
00:28:43.811 --> 00:28:45.511
- (boy) Here I go!
- (kids laughing)

258
00:28:48.849 --> 00:28:49.949
Aidan.

259
00:28:52.752 --> 00:28:53.922
(faucet squeaking)

260
00:28:56.323 --> 00:28:57.493
(low rumbling)

261
00:29:02.462 --> 00:29:03.502
(buzzing)

262
00:29:37.898 --> 00:29:39.298
(breathing heavily)

263
00:29:55.448 --> 00:29:56.548
(rumbling)

264
00:30:04.657 --> 00:30:06.157
(shutter clicking)

265
00:30:15.802 --> 00:30:16.942
Aidan!

266
00:30:18.972 --> 00:30:20.942
(carnival music playing)

267
00:30:22.943 --> 00:30:24.043
Are you in there?

268
00:30:25.578 --> 00:30:26.508
Aidan?

269
00:30:33.186 --> 00:30:35.386
Why didn't you
answer me, honey?
What are you...?

270
00:30:36.723 --> 00:30:38.533
Jesus.

271
00:30:38.591 --> 00:30:41.961
Jesus, you're freezing, honey.
What's going on? Are you sick?

272
00:30:42.595 --> 00:30:43.595
Talk to me, honey.

273
00:30:44.797 --> 00:30:46.997
Talk to me. What's going on?

274
00:30:47.067 --> 00:30:49.237
- What is it?
- I'm cold.

275
00:30:55.575 --> 00:30:57.505
It's okay. It's okay.

276
00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:12.490
Honey, when did this start?

277
00:31:14.461 --> 00:31:16.001
Was it last night,

278
00:31:16.729 --> 00:31:18.099
or this morning?

279
00:31:19.899 --> 00:31:22.039
I don't remember.

280
00:31:22.102 --> 00:31:24.302
I know
you don't like me prying,
but this is important.

281
00:31:27.674 --> 00:31:29.284
Was it your nightmare?

282
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:31.380
I really don't remember,
Rachel.

283
00:31:32.012 --> 00:31:33.512
I need you to try.

284
00:31:35.915 --> 00:31:39.385
You're sick, all right? And we
need to know what started it.

285
00:31:39.452 --> 00:31:40.422
Aidan.

286
00:31:46.593 --> 00:31:48.003
Was she in your nightmare?

287
00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:58.710
Rachel!

288
00:32:00.173 --> 00:32:01.073
(screeching)

289
00:32:06.379 --> 00:32:07.349
(grunting)

290
00:32:12.619 --> 00:32:13.849
(gasps)

291
00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.790
(Aidan panting) Don't stop.

292
00:32:15.855 --> 00:32:17.115
Don't stop.

293
00:32:18.691 --> 00:32:21.561
- Go! Drive! Drive!
- What's the matter, honey?

294
00:32:21.628 --> 00:32:23.028
Just don't stop the car!

295
00:32:23.096 --> 00:32:24.556
(grunting, snorting)

296
00:32:42.949 --> 00:32:44.449
(Rachel) Get down!

297
00:32:50.323 --> 00:32:51.623
- (engine revving)
- (tires screeching)

298
00:32:52.892 --> 00:32:54.132
- (grunting)
- (gasps)

299
00:32:58.065 --> 00:32:59.425
(shrieking)

300
00:33:05.138 --> 00:33:06.468
(both panting)

301
00:33:10.277 --> 00:33:11.577
"Don't stop."

302
00:33:13.646 --> 00:33:14.946
You said, "Don't stop."

303
00:33:15.014 --> 00:33:16.424
(deer grunting)

304
00:33:54.854 --> 00:33:55.794
Don't stop.

305
00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:20.709
(beeping)

306
00:34:21.714 --> 00:34:23.454
Okay. Let's see.

307
00:34:28.921 --> 00:34:29.861
That's impossible.

308
00:34:32.625 --> 00:34:33.585
Rachel...

309
00:34:35.595 --> 00:34:36.555
...what's happening?

310
00:34:42.535 --> 00:34:44.135
(Rachel) Yeah, hi, um...

311
00:34:44.204 --> 00:34:45.944
My son is very sick

312
00:34:46.005 --> 00:34:47.735
and I'd like to
talk to someone who...

313
00:34:51.644 --> 00:34:55.724
Well, it's his temperature.
It's... it's five degrees low.

314
00:35:23.876 --> 00:35:26.546
Yeah.
Well, then, I'll hold for
the on-call nurse.

315
00:35:29.649 --> 00:35:30.779
(clicks)

316
00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:31.780
Hello?

317
00:35:32.985 --> 00:35:33.815
Hello?

318
00:35:45.097 --> 00:35:46.427
(wind howling)

319
00:36:04.217 --> 00:36:06.287
Aidan?

320
00:36:06.353 --> 00:36:09.363
Honey,
the power just went out.
Are you okay up there?

321
00:36:13.793 --> 00:36:14.733
Aidan?

322
00:36:19.566 --> 00:36:21.696
Honey, this shouldn't be open.

323
00:36:22.201 --> 00:36:23.471
God.

324
00:36:23.536 --> 00:36:24.766
(scratching)

325
00:36:41.153 --> 00:36:42.963
Aidan, let's go.
Get out of bed.

326
00:36:48.328 --> 00:36:50.658
Aidan, what are you doing
over there?

327
00:36:52.865 --> 00:36:54.595
Get back in bed right now.

328
00:36:56.369 --> 00:36:57.769
I saw something.

329
00:37:02.309 --> 00:37:04.279
- (crackling)
- (rumbling)

330
00:37:10.783 --> 00:37:11.723
Aidan...

331
00:37:13.152 --> 00:37:15.422
Move! Get away.
Get away from there.

332
00:37:16.689 --> 00:37:18.689
Honey, let's go. Come on.

333
00:37:26.733 --> 00:37:28.503
- (Aidan) I saw it.
- (Rachel breathing heavily)

334
00:37:28.568 --> 00:37:30.768
- I saw it in my head.
- Let's go.

335
00:37:45.885 --> 00:37:47.385
(fog horn blaring)

336
00:37:52.792 --> 00:37:54.932
(people chattering)

337
00:37:54.994 --> 00:37:56.434
Oh, Ms. Keller...

338
00:37:57.397 --> 00:37:59.467
- About my story. I...
- Not now.

339
00:38:10.943 --> 00:38:15.053
Now, listen, sweetie.
Last night I found a tape.

340
00:38:16.048 --> 00:38:18.018
It was one of hers.

341
00:38:18.084 --> 00:38:20.554
And I made it so we'd never
have to see it again.

342
00:38:23.089 --> 00:38:24.659
But if she knows that,

343
00:38:26.459 --> 00:38:28.059
what I did might
make her wanna hurt us.

344
00:38:30.096 --> 00:38:33.326
Am I right?
Do you know something, honey?

345
00:38:35.034 --> 00:38:37.104
Look, if you know why she's
here, you have to tell me.

346
00:38:38.204 --> 00:38:39.114
Aidan...

347
00:38:41.007 --> 00:38:42.777
...is she here to hurt you?

348
00:38:45.111 --> 00:38:46.081
Honey.

349
00:38:55.321 --> 00:38:56.091
(whispering)She can hear us.

350
00:39:00.159 --> 00:39:01.589
She hears everything.

351
00:39:03.663 --> 00:39:05.403
Except when we sleep.

352
00:39:07.366 --> 00:39:08.696
She can't hear us
when we sleep?

353
00:39:10.236 --> 00:39:11.696
What does that mean?

354
00:39:13.339 --> 00:39:14.769
We have to sleep.

355
00:39:15.508 --> 00:39:16.708
(knocking)

356
00:39:18.277 --> 00:39:20.477
(Max) Rachel,
may I come in, please?

357
00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:22.150
Yeah.

358
00:39:26.318 --> 00:39:28.618
What happened to your car?

359
00:39:28.688 --> 00:39:30.758
Your car.
Apparently it's wrecked.

360
00:39:30.823 --> 00:39:33.133
- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah. We got hit.

361
00:39:34.193 --> 00:39:35.663
(Max) And no one's hurt?

362
00:39:36.362 --> 00:39:37.632
That's good.

363
00:39:39.231 --> 00:39:41.401
Aidan, right?
Hi, I'm Max.

364
00:39:44.571 --> 00:39:46.871
- Is he all right?
- He's sick.

365
00:39:46.939 --> 00:39:47.769
How sick?

366
00:39:54.714 --> 00:39:58.654
Max, I need your help.

367
00:40:34.954 --> 00:40:35.894
Here.

368
00:40:35.955 --> 00:40:38.485
I'll get some more blankets.

369
00:40:38.558 --> 00:40:40.588
The house is yours if there's
anything you need at all.

370
00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.660
(Rachel) Okay. Thanks.

371
00:40:43.496 --> 00:40:45.356
- Here.
- Thank you.

372
00:40:45.431 --> 00:40:46.501
Shouldn't he be at a hospital?

373
00:40:46.566 --> 00:40:48.166
No, he's fine.

374
00:40:48.234 --> 00:40:49.674
The bath?

375
00:40:49.736 --> 00:40:51.196
Just down the hall.
I'll get it started.

376
00:40:53.372 --> 00:40:54.542
Honey.

377
00:40:57.209 --> 00:40:58.849
I'm gonna go home
and get some of our things.

378
00:41:00.246 --> 00:41:03.246
Then we'll leave here
and never come back, okay?

379
00:41:08.821 --> 00:41:11.121
(Rachel) Let's get you
warmed up.

380
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:12.730
Not the best water pressure,
but it works.

381
00:41:12.792 --> 00:41:14.332
It's good, thanks.

382
00:41:14.393 --> 00:41:17.063
I don't know
why we lost power.
The block seemed fine.

383
00:41:17.129 --> 00:41:19.929
I have plenty of candles
in case the problem spreads.

384
00:41:19.999 --> 00:41:22.699
Let's go ahead and get in.
Get you warmed up.

385
00:41:22.769 --> 00:41:25.299
Max, I just need
to go back to my house,

386
00:41:25.371 --> 00:41:27.271
get a few things,
some medicine.

387
00:41:27.339 --> 00:41:29.839
Do you mind if you could...?

388
00:41:29.909 --> 00:41:32.009
- I'll watch him. Of course.
- Okay, thanks.

389
00:41:32.078 --> 00:41:34.808
Honey, go ahead and get in.
Let's go. Let's go.

390
00:41:36.649 --> 00:41:39.349
We need to
raise your temperature.
Now, let's get in.

391
00:41:39.418 --> 00:41:41.688
Aidan, what's wrong?
It's just water.

392
00:41:42.922 --> 00:41:44.522
We need to raise
your temperature...

393
00:41:44.591 --> 00:41:46.361
I don't want to,
Rachel.

394
00:41:46.425 --> 00:41:48.755
Do you want me
to get in with you?

395
00:41:48.828 --> 00:41:51.628
Let's go then.
Aidan. Come on, let's go.

396
00:41:53.432 --> 00:41:54.702
That's it.

397
00:41:55.702 --> 00:41:57.742
Come on, honey.
Let's go. Let's go.

398
00:41:58.537 --> 00:42:00.067
That's it. That's it.

399
00:42:01.841 --> 00:42:03.881
That's better, right?

400
00:42:03.943 --> 00:42:06.213
See? It's nice and warm.

401
00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:09.980
It's okay. Just relax.

402
00:42:35.942 --> 00:42:36.982
(wailing)

403
00:44:09.235 --> 00:44:10.395
(water pouring)

404
00:44:12.905 --> 00:44:14.265
(phone ringing)

405
00:44:21.914 --> 00:44:23.484
(Max) Hello?

406
00:44:23.549 --> 00:44:27.319
Officer Ray.
How you doing?

407
00:44:27.386 --> 00:44:29.416
Yeah, good, good. All right,
what do you got for me?

408
00:44:30.823 --> 00:44:34.333
Mm-hmm. Right.
Yeah. Yeah.

409
00:44:36.095 --> 00:44:39.125
Yeah, well, that all
sounds like page 26.

410
00:44:39.198 --> 00:44:41.168
You don't have any headlines?

411
00:44:42.668 --> 00:44:43.438
No?

412
00:44:44.904 --> 00:44:47.014
Well, business is business.

413
00:44:47.073 --> 00:44:49.413
Yeah. No, no, I'm good.
Real good.

414
00:44:51.043 --> 00:44:53.713
Could you do me a little favor
while I've got you?

415
00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:55.780
Could you look into
your accident reports

416
00:44:55.848 --> 00:44:58.918
and see
if there was an accident
with a woman and her son?

417
00:44:58.985 --> 00:45:00.345
"K" for Keller.

418
00:45:01.988 --> 00:45:03.588
No, no, I'm just trying
to get a story straight.

419
00:45:03.655 --> 00:45:05.055
(door squeaks shut)

420
00:45:06.258 --> 00:45:07.658
Ray?

421
00:45:07.726 --> 00:45:09.996
Ray, let me call you
right back. Okay.

422
00:45:15.567 --> 00:45:17.437
(knocking)

423
00:45:17.503 --> 00:45:19.213
Everything okay in there?

424
00:45:25.011 --> 00:45:28.821
Uh, Aidan, could you, uh,
unlock the door, please?

425
00:45:30.582 --> 00:45:32.482
(knocking) Aidan,
can you hear me?

426
00:45:50.302 --> 00:45:52.042
Aidan, please,
unlock the door!

427
00:45:52.104 --> 00:45:53.814
Aidan, open the door!

428
00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:56.810
Aidan. Aidan. Aidan!

429
00:45:56.876 --> 00:45:59.476
He's in the bath.
It was open a second ago.

430
00:45:59.545 --> 00:46:02.705
- Aidan, open the door!
- I'll get something
to break it.

431
00:46:02.781 --> 00:46:05.181
Aidan, open up the door.
I'm right here.

432
00:46:05.251 --> 00:46:07.691
Honey, can you hear me?
Please.

433
00:46:07.753 --> 00:46:09.763
You need to open up the door.

434
00:46:09.822 --> 00:46:10.862
Aidan!

435
00:46:14.526 --> 00:46:15.826
Aidan.

436
00:46:15.895 --> 00:46:16.895
Aidan.

437
00:46:17.563 --> 00:46:18.933
Oh, my God.

438
00:46:30.576 --> 00:46:31.576
Aidan!

439
00:46:31.643 --> 00:46:32.913
Aidan.

440
00:46:32.979 --> 00:46:34.879
Please, honey, open the...

441
00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.490
Oh, my God.

442
00:46:50.429 --> 00:46:51.229
Oh!

443
00:46:57.736 --> 00:46:58.966
Aidan.

444
00:46:59.038 --> 00:47:01.068
Aidan. Aidan.

445
00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:03.910
Look at me. Aidan, look at me.
Look at me.

446
00:47:29.468 --> 00:47:30.568
(coughing)

447
00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:33.110
Mommy!

448
00:47:35.507 --> 00:47:36.607
(shrieks)

449
00:47:45.918 --> 00:47:47.388
(Max) Rachel, no!

450
00:47:49.755 --> 00:47:51.085
(coughing)

451
00:47:51.958 --> 00:47:53.228
Baby. Oh.

452
00:47:55.995 --> 00:47:58.225
Oh, my God.
Baby, I'm sorry.

453
00:48:01.733 --> 00:48:03.603
It wasn't him.
It wasn't him.

454
00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:06.340
I was just trying to help.

455
00:48:06.405 --> 00:48:09.235
Okay, Rachel, let's just
get him out of there.

456
00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:20.020
Why is she doing this to me?

457
00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:22.820
I'm here now, baby.

458
00:48:22.888 --> 00:48:25.388
- Why is she doing this to me?
- It's okay, Aidan.

459
00:48:25.457 --> 00:48:26.927
We're gonna get you
to a hospital.

460
00:48:26.993 --> 00:48:28.763
No!

461
00:48:28.827 --> 00:48:31.297
- They can't do anything.
- (coughing)

462
00:48:31.363 --> 00:48:32.863
You asked for my help,
you're gonna get my help.

463
00:48:32.931 --> 00:48:34.171
He gets to a hospital,
Rachel. Now.

464
00:48:46.378 --> 00:48:47.378
(crying)

465
00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:56.820
(man) We're working to raise
his core temperature.

466
00:48:56.888 --> 00:48:58.988
He was at 90 degrees
when he came in.

467
00:48:59.058 --> 00:49:02.588
- He wasn't outside overnight?
- No. He was at home with me.

468
00:49:04.596 --> 00:49:08.196
A body doesn't develop
severe hypothermia on its own.

469
00:49:08.267 --> 00:49:10.097
Whatever the cause,
he's fighting it.

470
00:49:10.169 --> 00:49:11.739
Seems like he's stabilizing.

471
00:49:11.803 --> 00:49:13.573
- And he's just sleeping now?
- Right.

472
00:49:15.341 --> 00:49:17.341
And having some kind of dream.

473
00:49:35.361 --> 00:49:37.201
What's the story, Rachel?

474
00:49:40.199 --> 00:49:42.199
They stabilized
his temperature.

475
00:49:43.902 --> 00:49:46.272
I mean the story
with you and Aidan.

476
00:49:46.338 --> 00:49:47.638
You seem awfully
hard on him.

477
00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:57.280
Look, I know
it's a stressful time for you.

478
00:49:58.150 --> 00:50:00.450
Moving.
It's a whole new life.

479
00:50:02.488 --> 00:50:04.358
Maybe you should tell me.

480
00:50:10.028 --> 00:50:13.068
All I ever tried to do for him
was the right thing,

481
00:50:14.433 --> 00:50:16.273
and it only ever
made things worse.

482
00:50:17.203 --> 00:50:18.373
Then it wasn't
the right thing, was it?

483
00:50:37.389 --> 00:50:39.229
(Rachel) What do you see?

484
00:50:43.061 --> 00:50:44.531
Well, it's Aidan.

485
00:50:47.032 --> 00:50:50.842
- Is that a girl there?
- Why is she in the picture?

486
00:50:50.902 --> 00:50:52.672
- Why? How would I know?
- Why is she in all of them?

487
00:50:56.642 --> 00:50:57.812
Her name's Samara.

488
00:51:00.011 --> 00:51:02.051
She was murdered
by her mother.

489
00:51:02.114 --> 00:51:04.324
Left to die
at the bottom of a well.

490
00:51:05.717 --> 00:51:09.317
- Wait, she's... she's who?
- She didn't die.

491
00:51:09.388 --> 00:51:12.758
At least, not her ghost.
I kept it alive for Aidan.

492
00:51:14.193 --> 00:51:17.603
I let it out,
it spread and then we ran.

493
00:51:17.663 --> 00:51:20.333
- What are you talking about?
- I know this sounds crazy,

494
00:51:21.567 --> 00:51:24.567
but she's here now.
She's found us.

495
00:51:26.372 --> 00:51:28.412
And I thought it was
just to hurt Aidan,

496
00:51:28.474 --> 00:51:31.144
but it's more than that.
She wants to be him.

497
00:51:32.211 --> 00:51:34.611
And she wants to live
for real this time.

498
00:51:43.222 --> 00:51:46.232
You tell me,
who can help me?

499
00:51:47.193 --> 00:51:48.433
Who?

500
00:51:48.494 --> 00:51:50.804
I'm sure there's a rational...

501
00:51:50.862 --> 00:51:53.602
You take his picture
and tell me why she's in it.

502
00:51:53.665 --> 00:51:56.195
- Rachel.
- You take his picture.

503
00:51:56.268 --> 00:51:58.398
It's proof that he's what?
He's got a ghost inside him?

504
00:51:59.671 --> 00:52:02.411
No. The proof
is what will happen.

505
00:52:14.986 --> 00:52:18.856
(Rachel) Aidan,
you said Samara couldn't
hear us when we sleep.

506
00:52:21.193 --> 00:52:22.893
Well, you're sleeping now.

507
00:52:26.465 --> 00:52:28.565
Tell me how to stop her,
honey.

508
00:52:30.902 --> 00:52:32.672
Tell me how to help you.

509
00:52:32.738 --> 00:52:34.908
Just tell me,
I'll do anything, I swear.

510
00:52:50.389 --> 00:52:51.419
(gasping)

511
00:52:56.728 --> 00:52:58.558
- (woman singing softly)
- (low rumbling)

512
00:53:02.401 --> 00:53:03.601
(electronic whirring)

513
00:53:07.406 --> 00:53:09.276
(woman singing softly)

514
00:53:24.022 --> 00:53:25.662
(woman screaming)

515
00:53:26.525 --> 00:53:28.225
(high-pitched scream)

516
00:53:32.331 --> 00:53:33.601
(grinding)

517
00:53:36.234 --> 00:53:37.674
(breathing heavily)

518
00:53:46.845 --> 00:53:47.775
Aidan?

519
00:53:50.882 --> 00:53:52.282
- Aidan?
- Ms. Keller?

520
00:53:56.087 --> 00:53:58.717
Hello, I'm Dr. Emma Temple.

521
00:53:58.790 --> 00:54:01.530
I'm a consulting physician
at County Child Services.

522
00:54:03.329 --> 00:54:05.029
Well, I was hoping to speak
with Aidan when he wakes up.

523
00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:10.640
Is everything all right
in here?

524
00:54:11.437 --> 00:54:14.367
Yeah. It's fine.
Thank you.

525
00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:16.480
(Dr. Temple) I was hoping
to speak with you as well.

526
00:54:16.542 --> 00:54:19.752
It's Rachel, isn't it?
Yeah, about his situation.

527
00:54:23.014 --> 00:54:25.454
(Rachel) I'm sorry,
what kind of doctor
did you say you were again?

528
00:54:25.517 --> 00:54:27.287
I'm a psychiatrist.

529
00:54:27.353 --> 00:54:30.923
Yeah. I spoke
with a Dr., um...

530
00:54:32.691 --> 00:54:35.491
...Koji in Seattle.
Aidan's doctor.

531
00:54:35.561 --> 00:54:38.331
Look, if we could
maybe talk later.

532
00:54:38.397 --> 00:54:42.897
Right. Um, Dr. Koji mentioned
that you dealt with some PPD

533
00:54:43.669 --> 00:54:45.869
when Aidan was born.

534
00:54:45.937 --> 00:54:47.437
Postpartum depression.

535
00:54:47.506 --> 00:54:49.376
That was the first month.
That's all.

536
00:54:49.441 --> 00:54:52.241
I understand.
It's very common.

537
00:54:52.310 --> 00:54:56.850
I mean, a lot of women
have trouble adapting
to the stresses of motherhood.

538
00:54:56.915 --> 00:55:01.245
What does this have to do
with what's going on
with my son right now?

539
00:55:01.319 --> 00:55:04.759
Have you been
under stress lately?

540
00:55:04.823 --> 00:55:08.633
Have you ever found
that you were...

541
00:55:08.694 --> 00:55:12.034
...unable to experience love
for Aidan?

542
00:55:12.097 --> 00:55:14.667
- What?
- Have you hurt him,

543
00:55:15.567 --> 00:55:16.837
however unintentionally?

544
00:55:16.902 --> 00:55:20.172
Have you left him alone?
Abandoned him?

545
00:55:20.238 --> 00:55:23.438
I'd like to be with my son,
please, if you don't mind.

546
00:55:26.111 --> 00:55:27.451
Yeah, of course.

547
00:55:29.648 --> 00:55:31.118
I'm sorry, Rachel.

548
00:55:33.719 --> 00:55:35.389
(beeping)

549
00:55:35.454 --> 00:55:36.624
Until we can talk further,

550
00:55:36.688 --> 00:55:39.428
I cannot let you
be alone with him.

551
00:55:41.593 --> 00:55:42.633
I'm his mother.

552
00:55:44.730 --> 00:55:46.770
There are bruises on his body.

553
00:55:47.999 --> 00:55:50.699
He was hypothermic
and very near death.

554
00:55:50.769 --> 00:55:52.699
That is not because of me.

555
00:55:57.809 --> 00:56:00.209
(Dr. Temple) He's gonna be
all right, Rachel. He will.

556
00:56:00.278 --> 00:56:01.848
But you need to leave.

557
00:56:03.482 --> 00:56:04.782
Now, please.

558
00:56:11.823 --> 00:56:13.833
(whispering)
You can't have him, Samara.

559
00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:17.730
You're going back
to where you came from.

560
00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:47.460
All I wanna know is
what her history was
before the Morgans.

561
00:56:47.526 --> 00:56:50.496
I'm sorry, but the
privacy laws still apply.

562
00:56:50.562 --> 00:56:53.502
Well, was she really adopted?
Can you at least
tell me that much?

563
00:56:54.332 --> 00:56:55.732
Was their story true?

564
00:56:55.801 --> 00:56:56.901
Samara Morgan
was adopted, yes.

565
00:56:58.003 --> 00:57:00.743
But you won't tell me
from who?

566
00:57:00.806 --> 00:57:04.376
- I'd lose my job if I did.
- (sighing) Look, ma'am,

567
00:57:04.442 --> 00:57:07.712
my son has a medical condition
that his doctors
don't even understand.

568
00:57:07.779 --> 00:57:10.249
This little girl
had the same condition.

569
00:57:10.315 --> 00:57:15.015
Now, if I knew
what caused that,
it could save his life.

570
00:57:15.086 --> 00:57:19.056
(woman) All I can say is you
should speak to the Morgans.

571
00:57:19.124 --> 00:57:21.894
They're dead.
They both killed themselves.

572
00:58:53.885 --> 00:58:56.985
Whoa! Look out.
Early birds.

573
00:58:57.055 --> 00:58:59.485
Marty Savide,
Stevens Northwest Realty.

574
00:58:59.557 --> 00:59:02.427
- Hi.
- Uh, come in.

575
00:59:02.493 --> 00:59:06.033
I thought
I put 12:30 on the ad.
For the open house.

576
00:59:06.097 --> 00:59:07.767
- How'd you get
around the gate?
- Well, I just...

577
00:59:07.833 --> 00:59:10.103
Ah! Who cares? Come on.

578
00:59:10.168 --> 00:59:12.798
Make me an offer
over asking and it's yours.

579
00:59:14.272 --> 00:59:16.882
Okay, then, don't mind me.

580
00:59:16.942 --> 00:59:18.782
My first try
with these things,
took off flying.

581
00:59:19.277 --> 00:59:20.577
(chuckling)

582
00:59:22.213 --> 00:59:23.253
There we go.

583
00:59:24.282 --> 00:59:26.322
What do you think?

584
00:59:26.384 --> 00:59:29.664
Um, a little color will really
turn the place around.

585
00:59:30.555 --> 00:59:32.415
It's got a wonderful history.

586
00:59:32.490 --> 00:59:34.590
Working horse ranch.
How about that?

587
00:59:34.660 --> 00:59:37.700
And there's even this cute
little tree house thing
way up in the barn.

588
00:59:39.264 --> 00:59:43.204
Um, is the place being
sold unfurnished or...?

589
00:59:44.636 --> 00:59:46.066
The previous owners
didn't leave anything behind?

590
00:59:47.639 --> 00:59:51.679
Well, there were some things
that were left, after they...

591
00:59:52.711 --> 00:59:54.111
...moved.

592
00:59:54.179 --> 00:59:56.579
We're storing all that
in the basement.

593
00:59:56.648 --> 00:59:58.678
There's a basement?

594
00:59:58.750 --> 01:00:02.690
Uh... Well, you betcha.
No extra charge.

595
01:00:02.754 --> 01:00:04.124
Right this way.

596
01:00:07.726 --> 01:00:09.056
(low rumbling)

597
01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.800
(Savide)
Uh, if you don't mind,
I'm the welcome wagon.

598
01:00:17.869 --> 01:00:19.469
Gotta open up the gate
for everyone else.

599
01:00:19.537 --> 01:00:22.137
So please,
just make yourself at home.

600
01:00:22.207 --> 01:00:24.977
Do you know what happened
to them? The previous owners?

601
01:00:26.812 --> 01:00:28.682
I believe they bought
a condo in Phoenix.

602
01:00:28.747 --> 01:00:29.817
Really?

603
01:02:22.961 --> 01:02:23.901
(music box music plays)

604
01:03:11.176 --> 01:03:13.106
(woman singing softly)

605
01:03:56.621 --> 01:03:57.921
Her mother.

606
01:04:03.028 --> 01:04:04.058
(gasps)

607
01:04:30.855 --> 01:04:32.455
I'll take it from here.

608
01:04:38.829 --> 01:04:40.599
Hello, Aidan,
I'm Dr. Temple.

609
01:04:41.866 --> 01:04:42.966
How are you feeling?

610
01:04:46.871 --> 01:04:48.011
Aidan?

611
01:04:50.808 --> 01:04:53.508
You know,
I'd really like to help you.

612
01:04:54.812 --> 01:04:57.122
Can you tell me
how you're feeling?

613
01:05:00.018 --> 01:05:01.118
Where's my mommy?

614
01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:05.820
Well, she'll be here soon.
She's on her way.

615
01:05:05.890 --> 01:05:07.260
I want Mommy.

616
01:05:08.659 --> 01:05:10.129
Yeah, I know you do.

617
01:05:11.062 --> 01:05:12.402
Your mommy
wants to be with you too.

618
01:05:13.598 --> 01:05:14.998
So where is she?

619
01:05:16.034 --> 01:05:18.044
She went home.

620
01:05:18.103 --> 01:05:20.743
She didn't think that you
were gonna wake up so soon.

621
01:05:20.805 --> 01:05:21.665
I wanna go home too.

622
01:05:23.008 --> 01:05:25.108
Well, you will.

623
01:05:25.176 --> 01:05:27.446
We just have to...
We just have to get you...

624
01:05:32.817 --> 01:05:34.217
You're freezing.

625
01:05:36.654 --> 01:05:38.024
I wanna go home to Mommy.

626
01:05:40.825 --> 01:05:42.985
Well, we need
to talk about her.

627
01:05:44.562 --> 01:05:46.662
Can you tell me
about Mommy a little bit?

628
01:05:48.766 --> 01:05:50.096
She loves me.

629
01:05:51.436 --> 01:05:53.166
I know that she does.

630
01:05:54.239 --> 01:05:56.609
She went looking for me.
She tried to find me.

631
01:05:58.643 --> 01:06:00.253
It means she loves me.

632
01:06:02.213 --> 01:06:03.483
I don't understand.

633
01:06:07.585 --> 01:06:08.585
Can I go home now?

634
01:06:11.256 --> 01:06:13.516
No, honey,
you're not well enough.

635
01:06:17.595 --> 01:06:18.725
Can I go home?

636
01:06:20.031 --> 01:06:21.031
No.

637
01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:31.040
I'm sorry.

638
01:06:40.418 --> 01:06:42.588
Then I have
to show you something.

639
01:07:40.845 --> 01:07:42.175
It won't stop.

640
01:07:48.619 --> 01:07:49.689
(exhales)

641
01:08:26.924 --> 01:08:29.294
(woman) I'm gonna walk you
just around the corner here.

642
01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:46.880
Her name was Evelyn.

643
01:08:48.579 --> 01:08:50.949
She came to us
eight months pregnant.

644
01:08:51.015 --> 01:08:53.445
- Did she have her baby here?
- Yes.

645
01:08:53.518 --> 01:08:55.288
And you arranged
for the adoption?

646
01:08:55.353 --> 01:08:57.393
That's right.

647
01:08:57.455 --> 01:08:59.585
- And the father?
- There was none.

648
01:09:02.627 --> 01:09:05.027
Half the mothers
that come to us say that.

649
01:09:05.095 --> 01:09:07.495
So, what did she think
got her pregnant?

650
01:09:07.565 --> 01:09:09.025
(woman) Evelyn wasn't well.

651
01:09:09.099 --> 01:09:11.899
She had been having problems
during the pregnancy:

652
01:09:11.969 --> 01:09:13.739
Hallucinations, visions.

653
01:09:14.972 --> 01:09:18.082
She believed some thing
had come for her baby

654
01:09:18.142 --> 01:09:20.452
from the waters of the world
beyond this one.

655
01:09:20.511 --> 01:09:22.911
I'm sorry.
Did you say water?

656
01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:28.020
Well, we all envision
the afterlife differently.

657
01:09:28.085 --> 01:09:31.215
For Evelyn,
it's just what she believed.

658
01:09:33.090 --> 01:09:37.160
As you might imagine,
she suffered severe
postpartum depression.

659
01:09:37.228 --> 01:09:40.398
She blamed her troubles
on her child.

660
01:09:40.465 --> 01:09:42.265
So she tried to kill it.

661
01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:50.940
- All babies are a challenge.
- (baby cooing)

662
01:09:52.076 --> 01:09:55.446
But Samara, she never cried.

663
01:09:56.647 --> 01:09:57.617
Never.

664
01:09:58.916 --> 01:10:01.316
Except when her mother
would try to bathe her.

665
01:10:01.386 --> 01:10:04.216
Then she'd scream like it
was the end of the world.

666
01:10:10.295 --> 01:10:12.595
It was the screaming
that woke us.

667
01:10:12.663 --> 01:10:13.833
(baby screaming and crying)

668
01:10:20.671 --> 01:10:22.841
- Evelyn, don't!
- (crying continues)

669
01:10:28.513 --> 01:10:29.853
(woman) Evelyn!

670
01:10:30.515 --> 01:10:31.845
Evelyn, stop!

671
01:10:46.196 --> 01:10:48.666
(woman) She was trying
to drown the baby.

672
01:10:48.733 --> 01:10:50.503
The baby was taken from her,
of course.

673
01:10:50.568 --> 01:10:52.398
Evelyn was institutionalized.

674
01:10:53.638 --> 01:10:55.968
And all those pictures
she'd been collecting,

675
01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:57.680
they finally made sense.

676
01:11:02.146 --> 01:11:03.876
Did she say why she did it?

677
01:11:05.316 --> 01:11:07.746
She felt she had to kill
her baby to save it.

678
01:12:09.079 --> 01:12:11.849
I'm here to see a patient.
Her name's Evelyn.

679
01:12:11.916 --> 01:12:14.146
- I don't know her last name.
- Evelyn?

680
01:12:14.218 --> 01:12:15.518
That's right.

681
01:12:18.489 --> 01:12:20.729
Evelyn's expecting you.

682
01:12:20.791 --> 01:12:23.191
Every few years, one of you
comes to see Evelyn.

683
01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:26.330
She's like a freakin' patron
saint or something.

684
01:12:26.397 --> 01:12:27.767
Got a problem with your kid,
don't you?

685
01:12:27.832 --> 01:12:29.572
(woman singing softly)

686
01:12:35.139 --> 01:12:36.769
Something wrong?

687
01:12:36.841 --> 01:12:39.441
That song. I know it.

688
01:12:40.344 --> 01:12:41.814
Yeah. They all do.

689
01:12:49.219 --> 01:12:51.019
Hey, Evelyn.

690
01:12:51.088 --> 01:12:53.858
You were right as rain.
You got a visitor today.

691
01:12:54.959 --> 01:12:57.459
Hope she's some help
to your troubles.

692
01:12:57.528 --> 01:12:59.228
Ten minutes.

693
01:12:59.296 --> 01:13:00.696
- (scissors cutting)
- (woman humming)

694
01:13:05.670 --> 01:13:07.070
My name's Rachel.

695
01:13:08.539 --> 01:13:10.009
But you know that.

696
01:13:16.747 --> 01:13:19.177
(Evelyn) Some days I
sort of have a feeling.

697
01:13:20.951 --> 01:13:22.021
A feeling?

698
01:13:23.353 --> 01:13:25.023
This is about your child.

699
01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:30.730
It's...

700
01:13:33.664 --> 01:13:35.474
- It's about yours.
- (cutting stops)

701
01:13:35.533 --> 01:13:36.673
Samara.

702
01:13:46.010 --> 01:13:47.880
They don't dream, you know.

703
01:13:49.379 --> 01:13:50.919
The dead don't dream.

704
01:13:55.686 --> 01:13:58.856
Look, something's happened
to my son.

705
01:13:58.923 --> 01:14:00.693
- You have to sleep to dream.
- It has to do
with your daughter.

706
01:14:00.758 --> 01:14:03.188
And the dead never sleep.

707
01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:04.500
They wait...

708
01:14:05.896 --> 01:14:07.796
...and watch for a way back.

709
01:14:10.901 --> 01:14:11.941
But they never sleep.

710
01:14:14.171 --> 01:14:16.971
- That's why dreams are safe.
- I'm sorry, I just...

711
01:14:17.041 --> 01:14:19.841
I don't have a lot of time.
Please, I need your help.

712
01:14:20.711 --> 01:14:22.081
I have to know.
Can you tell me?

713
01:14:24.582 --> 01:14:26.122
Why did you try
to kill your baby?

714
01:14:28.719 --> 01:14:29.719
Why?

715
01:14:32.389 --> 01:14:33.819
Because my baby told me to.

716
01:14:35.793 --> 01:14:37.803
Just like yours
will tell you.

717
01:14:37.862 --> 01:14:39.662
And you have to do it.

718
01:14:41.599 --> 01:14:43.729
- You have to send it back.
- What?

719
01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:51.580
They stopped me.

720
01:14:53.644 --> 01:14:56.084
- Don't let them stop you.
- What?

721
01:14:58.749 --> 01:15:00.119
Listen to the voices.

722
01:15:01.285 --> 01:15:02.115
What are you talking about?

723
01:15:03.353 --> 01:15:05.823
Because it's our fault.
We did it.

724
01:15:05.890 --> 01:15:07.960
Yes. We did it. Yes.

725
01:15:08.025 --> 01:15:10.155
It was you.
It was you! You did it!

726
01:15:10.227 --> 01:15:11.127
What did I do?

727
01:15:12.062 --> 01:15:13.262
(door unbolting)

728
01:15:14.565 --> 01:15:16.225
(man) Evelyn, that's enough.

729
01:15:18.669 --> 01:15:20.039
I love my son.

730
01:15:22.406 --> 01:15:25.106
(man) Come on.
It's all right.

731
01:15:25.175 --> 01:15:26.135
I'm sorry, ma'am,
that's enough for today.

732
01:15:28.378 --> 01:15:29.608
Let's go.

733
01:15:30.214 --> 01:15:31.584
What did I do?

734
01:15:33.417 --> 01:15:34.717
You let the dead get in.

735
01:15:37.688 --> 01:15:39.058
(man) Let's go.

736
01:15:52.737 --> 01:15:54.167
What should I do?

737
01:15:56.406 --> 01:15:57.906
Be a good mother.

738
01:16:00.510 --> 01:16:01.950
Listen to your baby.

739
01:16:06.951 --> 01:16:08.591
Listen to your baby.

740
01:16:14.959 --> 01:16:16.629
Listen to your baby.

741
01:16:19.096 --> 01:16:20.726
Listen to your baby.

742
01:16:22.099 --> 01:16:23.869
Listen to your baby.

743
01:16:23.934 --> 01:16:25.244
- (cutting resumes)
- (humming continues)

744
01:16:56.333 --> 01:16:57.333
(TV static)

745
01:17:05.876 --> 01:17:07.846
(knocking) Aidan?

746
01:17:13.117 --> 01:17:13.947
Hey.

747
01:17:17.654 --> 01:17:19.794
Shouldn't you, uh...

748
01:17:19.857 --> 01:17:21.557
Shouldn't you be
at the hospital?

749
01:17:21.625 --> 01:17:22.955
No. I'm here
waiting for my mommy.

750
01:17:24.428 --> 01:17:25.298
Okay.

751
01:17:27.464 --> 01:17:30.874
Well, you can't really
leave till the hospital
says it's okay.

752
01:17:32.336 --> 01:17:33.966
You were very,
very sick.

753
01:17:36.673 --> 01:17:38.213
You're all right now?

754
01:17:44.481 --> 01:17:45.821
The cable setup at my house,

755
01:17:45.883 --> 01:17:48.353
the TV needs to be
on channel three.

756
01:17:50.154 --> 01:17:52.064
She loves me.
She loves me not.

757
01:17:53.423 --> 01:17:55.393
- Thank you, Max.
- Sure.

758
01:17:58.796 --> 01:18:01.126
She loves me!

759
01:18:01.198 --> 01:18:02.298
Look, Mandy!

760
01:18:05.569 --> 01:18:07.839
I think I'm gonna puke.

761
01:18:07.905 --> 01:18:09.865
Why don't you do something
productive with your life?

762
01:18:12.676 --> 01:18:15.176
Say, Billy,
if you like fish so much...

763
01:18:15.245 --> 01:18:16.245
Your mom loves you,
you know.

764
01:18:17.848 --> 01:18:19.348
She loves you a lot.

765
01:18:24.221 --> 01:18:25.791
You'd tell someone
if you weren't sure
about that, right?

766
01:18:27.224 --> 01:18:30.394
Like, if she'd been
hurting you somehow.

767
01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:35.170
Did she ever treat you
like you're someone else?

768
01:18:36.733 --> 01:18:39.343
I'm not somebody else.
I'm Aidan.

769
01:18:39.403 --> 01:18:41.543
- I know.
- We don't need anyone else.

770
01:18:41.605 --> 01:18:42.805
That's right.

771
01:18:42.873 --> 01:18:47.243
We don't need you,
that doctor or anyone else.

772
01:18:48.278 --> 01:18:49.178
Okay?

773
01:18:51.949 --> 01:18:53.049
Okay.

774
01:19:07.131 --> 01:19:08.801
What are you doing?

775
01:19:10.801 --> 01:19:13.041
I was just gonna
take a picture of you.

776
01:19:13.103 --> 01:19:13.973
No.

777
01:19:17.307 --> 01:19:19.907
- It'll be for your mom.
- No.

778
01:19:19.977 --> 01:19:23.277
Why not? What's wrong
with taking your picture?

779
01:19:23.347 --> 01:19:26.717
I'll tell you what's wrong
if you promise not to take it.

780
01:19:26.783 --> 01:19:27.783
But that's only
if you promise.

781
01:19:28.986 --> 01:19:30.386
Fine. I promise.

782
01:19:39.964 --> 01:19:41.004
So, Aidan, what's the story?

783
01:20:02.286 --> 01:20:07.356
(on TV)
* We're happy when we're sad

784
01:20:07.424 --> 01:20:10.634
* We're always feeling sad

785
01:20:10.694 --> 01:20:12.064
(Rachel) Hello?

786
01:20:12.963 --> 01:20:16.573
- (TV) How are you?
- Terrible.

787
01:20:16.633 --> 01:20:22.973
* That's why we're happy
when we're sad *

788
01:20:28.979 --> 01:20:30.009
Max?

789
01:20:32.716 --> 01:20:34.046
Are you here?

790
01:20:46.330 --> 01:20:48.700
- You're home!
- (gasping) Oh, God.

791
01:20:48.765 --> 01:20:51.495
What are you doing here?
I thought you were
at the hospital.

792
01:20:52.336 --> 01:20:53.396
No. I'm here, Mommy.

793
01:20:56.540 --> 01:20:59.080
- What did you say?
- I said I'm here.

794
01:21:02.779 --> 01:21:04.079
Is Max here?

795
01:21:05.782 --> 01:21:06.882
No.

796
01:21:08.052 --> 01:21:09.922
But his coat...

797
01:21:18.295 --> 01:21:20.595
He went away.
You wanna watch
some TV with me?

798
01:21:21.999 --> 01:21:23.099
Uh...

799
01:21:24.568 --> 01:21:26.838
(TV turns on)

800
01:21:26.903 --> 01:21:30.443
I, uh, I just have to get
something from the car. Okay?

801
01:21:36.913 --> 01:21:38.153
I love you, Mommy.

802
01:22:18.922 --> 01:22:19.722
Max.

803
01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:31.600
Max?

804
01:22:35.305 --> 01:22:36.605
(screaming)

805
01:23:12.342 --> 01:23:15.882
(TV) Goldfish must have water
in order to exist.

806
01:23:15.945 --> 01:23:18.245
But goldfish hate cats.

807
01:23:25.255 --> 01:23:28.685
While on the other hand,
cats hate water.

808
01:23:37.434 --> 01:23:38.444
(crying)

809
01:24:02.992 --> 01:24:04.192
Rachel.

810
01:24:07.597 --> 01:24:09.427
Are you sleeping, Rachel?

811
01:24:11.535 --> 01:24:14.395
I am. She makes me sleep
all the time now.

812
01:24:15.605 --> 01:24:17.265
Aidan.

813
01:24:17.341 --> 01:24:19.411
Shh.
Just keep sleeping, Rachel.

814
01:24:20.544 --> 01:24:23.854
So she can't hear us.
It's the only way.

815
01:24:23.913 --> 01:24:25.553
You have to show her, Rachel.

816
01:24:26.283 --> 01:24:27.153
Show her she can't stay.

817
01:24:28.485 --> 01:24:29.445
In you.

818
01:24:31.221 --> 01:24:33.191
How? How do I do that?

819
01:24:34.958 --> 01:24:36.128
Take me to where
she's afraid of.

820
01:24:38.495 --> 01:24:40.795
- You know where
she's afraid of.
- (mouths word)

821
01:24:40.864 --> 01:24:41.834
Take me there...

822
01:24:44.033 --> 01:24:46.073
- ...and kill me.
- Aidan, no.

823
01:24:46.136 --> 01:24:48.736
Shh. Rachel,
keep sleeping.

824
01:24:48.805 --> 01:24:50.605
She won't stay if she knows
you'll kill me.

825
01:24:53.143 --> 01:24:55.783
- (Aidan) It's the only way.
- I can't do it. I can't.

826
01:25:01.818 --> 01:25:02.688
Then she stays.

827
01:25:05.322 --> 01:25:07.362
- (whirring)
- (gasping) She's heard us.

828
01:25:09.926 --> 01:25:11.126
(panting)

829
01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:24.870
(TV indistinct)

830
01:25:29.979 --> 01:25:30.909
Honey?

831
01:25:32.449 --> 01:25:34.149
I thought you were sleeping,
Mommy.

832
01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:39.520
I was, but I had a bad dream.

833
01:25:39.589 --> 01:25:40.519
You must've had a nightmare.

834
01:25:42.025 --> 01:25:44.525
It's all right.
We all have them.

835
01:25:47.997 --> 01:25:49.697
Will you stay with me now?

836
01:25:50.534 --> 01:25:52.944
- Stay?
- Stay for always.

837
01:25:56.873 --> 01:25:58.983
Yeah. Yeah.

838
01:25:59.042 --> 01:26:01.352
Alrighty.
Let's watch some TV together.

839
01:26:02.045 --> 01:26:05.475
It's kind of late, honey.

840
01:26:08.452 --> 01:26:10.822
Don't you think
you should sleep?

841
01:26:14.958 --> 01:26:16.288
I never sleep.

842
01:26:23.433 --> 01:26:26.773
Then let Mommy
make you something.

843
01:27:45.515 --> 01:27:47.975
Something wrong?
You seem sad.

844
01:27:51.054 --> 01:27:53.524
No, honey, I'm not sad.

845
01:27:54.424 --> 01:27:56.064
I'm just tired, that's all.

846
01:27:59.262 --> 01:28:00.962
Well, now you have me
to protect you.

847
01:28:17.213 --> 01:28:18.953
(woman singing on TV)

848
01:28:33.463 --> 01:28:35.903
* You ain't
the biggest catfish
in the deep blue sea *

849
01:28:49.646 --> 01:28:52.316
(Aidan) Take me to where
she's afraid of.

850
01:28:52.382 --> 01:28:54.122
You know where
she's afraid of.

851
01:28:55.752 --> 01:28:58.022
You have to show her, Rachel.

852
01:28:58.087 --> 01:28:59.717
Show her she can't stay.

853
01:29:02.759 --> 01:29:04.489
(Evelyn) Listen to the voices.

854
01:29:04.561 --> 01:29:07.031
You have to listen
to the voices.

855
01:29:11.601 --> 01:29:14.471
(echoing) Be a good mother.
Be a good mother.

856
01:29:16.105 --> 01:29:17.605
Listen to your baby.

857
01:30:14.263 --> 01:30:15.433
I'm sorry.

858
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.170
I'm so sorry.

859
01:30:20.604 --> 01:30:22.044
But you can't stay.

860
01:30:30.647 --> 01:30:32.747
What are you doing?
Rachel!

861
01:30:34.283 --> 01:30:35.123
What are you doing?

862
01:30:36.119 --> 01:30:37.849
It's me.

863
01:30:37.921 --> 01:30:40.191
- It's not her, Rachel.
- I know, baby.

864
01:30:40.256 --> 01:30:41.186
It's me.

865
01:30:42.692 --> 01:30:44.932
I love you.
Mommy, I love you.

866
01:30:46.029 --> 01:30:47.159
I know, baby.

867
01:30:49.733 --> 01:30:51.103
I love you too.

868
01:31:05.515 --> 01:31:07.115
But you're not my son.

869
01:31:16.359 --> 01:31:17.589
(gasping)

870
01:31:32.475 --> 01:31:33.775
(squealing)

871
01:31:46.189 --> 01:31:47.119
Mommy.

872
01:32:02.138 --> 01:32:03.068
Aidan.

873
01:32:05.274 --> 01:32:08.014
Aidan. Aidan. Aidan.

874
01:32:14.183 --> 01:32:15.153
Honey.

875
01:32:18.354 --> 01:32:21.164
Breathe. Baby, breathe.

876
01:32:22.225 --> 01:32:24.655
Please.
I know it's you, honey.

877
01:32:24.728 --> 01:32:25.858
Aidan.

878
01:32:28.665 --> 01:32:30.025
Aidan, please.

879
01:32:32.936 --> 01:32:33.836
Rachel.

880
01:32:38.207 --> 01:32:39.137
Yeah.

881
01:32:40.376 --> 01:32:41.746
I'm right here.

882
01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:44.780
You're okay.

883
01:32:45.715 --> 01:32:47.745
Everything's all right, honey.

884
01:32:52.288 --> 01:32:53.758
You were sleeping.

885
01:32:54.924 --> 01:32:56.734
You were just sleeping.

886
01:33:03.366 --> 01:33:04.866
(high-pitched squeal)

887
01:33:08.204 --> 01:33:09.074
(eerie whining)

888
01:33:14.277 --> 01:33:15.077
No.

889
01:33:18.481 --> 01:33:19.821
(water flowing)

890
01:33:29.793 --> 01:33:30.963
(Aidan) She wants me again.

891
01:33:34.230 --> 01:33:35.100
No.

892
01:33:43.239 --> 01:33:45.109
Rachel, what are you doing?

893
01:33:48.778 --> 01:33:51.848
All she wants is a mother.
That's all she wants.

894
01:33:56.219 --> 01:33:58.789
And she'll keep coming
till she finds one.

895
01:33:59.689 --> 01:34:01.729
(Aidan) Come on!
Come back!

896
01:34:01.791 --> 01:34:03.361
Get away from her!
Rachel!

897
01:34:04.193 --> 01:34:05.733
Get away from her!

898
01:34:09.065 --> 01:34:10.225
You can't have my son.

899
01:34:14.871 --> 01:34:16.071
So take me.

900
01:34:17.774 --> 01:34:19.014
Rachel! No!

901
01:34:25.882 --> 01:34:27.452
Rachel! Rachel!

902
01:34:36.092 --> 01:34:37.032
(crashing)

903
01:35:05.521 --> 01:35:06.321
Samara!

904
01:35:07.857 --> 01:35:09.357
Here I am, Samara.

905
01:35:12.661 --> 01:35:14.201
Just like you wanted.

906
01:35:17.666 --> 01:35:18.726
But you leave him alone!

907
01:35:21.104 --> 01:35:22.274
You hear me?

908
01:35:23.372 --> 01:35:25.012
(electric buzzing)

909
01:35:30.013 --> 01:35:31.253
(Samara) Help me.

910
01:35:41.791 --> 01:35:43.131
It's always open.

911
01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:47.500
Her only way out
is always open.

912
01:36:11.955 --> 01:36:15.315
(Samara muffled) Mommy.

913
01:36:27.370 --> 01:36:29.870
Mommy!

914
01:36:36.479 --> 01:36:39.149
Mommy.

915
01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:46.220
(high-pitched squeal)

916
01:36:52.561 --> 01:36:54.001
(breathing heavily)

917
01:37:10.346 --> 01:37:12.176
(panting, straining)

918
01:38:34.497 --> 01:38:36.627
- Mommy!
- I'm not your fucking mommy.

919
01:38:38.767 --> 01:38:40.267
(gasping)

920
01:39:03.226 --> 01:39:04.556
(Aidan) Rachel.

921
01:39:06.595 --> 01:39:07.695
(whirring)

922
01:39:22.845 --> 01:39:24.175
(Aidan) Rachel.

923
01:39:29.618 --> 01:39:30.588
Rachel.

924
01:40:23.206 --> 01:40:24.366
Rachel.

925
01:40:28.144 --> 01:40:29.154
Rachel.

926
01:40:30.146 --> 01:40:32.316
- Can you hear me?
- I can hear you.

927
01:40:33.849 --> 01:40:35.419
(Aidan) I'm right here.

928
01:41:04.547 --> 01:41:05.577
(silence)

929
01:41:06.715 --> 01:41:08.075
(Aidan) Rachel.

930
01:41:10.719 --> 01:41:11.719
Rachel!

931
01:41:14.957 --> 01:41:16.157
You're here.

932
01:41:18.627 --> 01:41:20.627
- You're here, Rachel.
- Of course I'm here.

933
01:41:22.231 --> 01:41:23.831
I followed your voice.

934
01:41:27.236 --> 01:41:28.596
What happened?

935
01:41:31.774 --> 01:41:33.214
It's over, honey.

936
01:41:35.043 --> 01:41:36.653
She's not coming back.

937
01:41:38.381 --> 01:41:40.181
How do you know, Rachel?

938
01:41:43.786 --> 01:41:44.746
I know.

939
01:41:47.756 --> 01:41:48.856
I promise.

940
01:41:54.730 --> 01:41:55.800
I promise.

941
01:41:56.999 --> 01:41:58.469
I love you, Mommy.

942
01:42:01.770 --> 01:42:03.340
Promise me something?

943
01:42:04.373 --> 01:42:06.813
Yeah. Anything, Mom.
Anything.

944
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:09.450
Just call me Rachel.

945
01:42:12.248 --> 01:42:13.778
At least for a while.
