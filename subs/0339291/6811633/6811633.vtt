00:35:11.526 --> 00:35:14.236
I think... I think our parents
used to play it for us.

535
00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:17.823
They certainly did, as I did for mine.

- Oh, yes.

537

You're Olaf and we're not letting you in.

is a tad askew.

You can't be buying this.

- We've got to get a message to him.
- Leave that to me.

616
00:40:02.566 --> 00:40:04.984
I was feeding the moray,

617
00:40:05.361 --> 00:40:09.072
and of course I got cocky.

618
00:40:09.323 --> 00:40:13.076
And that's all it takes.
That's all it takes is one time.

619
00:40:15.704 --> 00:40:16.996
Just once.

620
00:40:17.331 --> 00:40:19.999
I had the kipper in my mouth
and I offered it.

621
00:40:20.334 --> 00:40:24.212
And there was a team from
National Geographic that were there.

622
00:40:24.296 --> 00:40:25.713
They were filming the whole thing

623
00:40:25.798 --> 00:40:29.175
and, well, a lot of people
don't know this about the moray,

624
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:32.887
but you think this can't be
a tremendously strong animal.

625
00:40:33.013 --> 00:40:35.390
Sure, it has a certain amount
of strength,

626
00:40:35.975 --> 00:40:38.560
but how does it pull a man's face
into a cave?

627
00:40:38.686 --> 00:40:43.273
Anyway, long story short,
the bends, the reconstructive surgery,

628
00:40:43.357 --> 00:40:48.778
but yes, from my understanding,
Peru is a wonderful place.

629
00:40:49.238 --> 00:40:51.072
The beaches. The people.

631
00:40:53.868 --> 00:40:55.660
Relaxed guardianship laws?

632
00:40:57.204 --> 00:40:59.164
Did I say that?

633
00:41:00.458 --> 00:41:01.749

00:41:02.251 --> 00:41:06.796

a wonderful gift for storytelling.

- Doesn't he, children?
- Oh, yeah.

00:41:14.638 --> 00:41:16.389

640
00:41:20.019 --> 00:41:23.354
Yeah, sure. I'll take a shot at that.

643
00:41:27.443 --> 00:41:29.194

they're hard to locate.

647
00:41:37.828 --> 00:41:40.705
and go ahead and
start the party without me.

648
00:41:40.789 --> 00:41:43.124
I'm not sure I brought my milking gear.

649
00:41:43.209 --> 00:41:45.418

(CLEARING THROAT)

1376
01:29:52.887 --> 01:29:54.971
Don't worry, children.

1377
01:29:55.056 --> 01:29:58.517
I'm sure the authorities will catch up
with Count Olaf very soon.

1378
01:29:59.519 --> 01:30:03.605
We'll all never have to deal
with that terrible man again.

1379
01:30:06.901 --> 01:30:08.735
Before we leave,

1380
01:30:09.821 --> 01:30:14.116
perhaps there's time
for just one last stop.

1381
01:31:22.852 --> 01:31:24.603
(BELL RINGING)

1382
01:31:30.568 --> 01:31:32.152
(RINGING)

1383
01:31:38.075 --> 01:31:39.826
(RINGING CONTINUES)

1384
01:32:00.097 --> 01:32:03.391
"Violet, Klaus and Sunny."
It's addressed to us.

1385
01:32:03.476 --> 01:32:05.435
Look at all these postmarks.

1386
01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:07.854
It's been to England

1387
01:32:07.939 --> 01:32:10.440
and Rome and Kenya and Iceland.

1388
01:32:10.608 --> 01:32:14.027
- I don't know where these are from.
- Who's it from?

1389
01:32:20.701 --> 01:32:22.494
Mom and Dad.

1390
01:32:37.134 --> 01:32:38.593
It's the letter.

1391
01:32:39.303 --> 01:32:41.304
The letter that never came.

1392
01:32:45.393 --> 01:32:47.352
"Dearest children,

1393
01:32:47.436 --> 01:32:50.313
"since we've been abroad
we have missed you all so much.

1394
01:32:51.190 --> 01:32:55.277
"Certain events have compelled us
to extend our travels.

1395
01:32:55.361 --> 01:32:57.195
"One day, when you're older,

1396
01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:00.156
"you will learn all about the people
we have befriended

1397
01:33:00.241 --> 01:33:02.158
"and the dangers we have faced.

1398
01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:05.912
"At times the world can seem
an unfriendly and sinister place.

1399
01:33:05.997 --> 01:33:09.624
"But believe us when we say that
there is much more good in it than bad.

1400
01:33:09.709 --> 01:33:12.502
"All you have to do is look hard enough.

1401
01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:15.046
"And what might seem to be
a series of unfortunate events

1402
01:33:15.131 --> 01:33:18.008
"may, in fact,
be the first steps of a journey.

1403
01:33:19.385 --> 01:33:22.095
"We hope to have you back
in our arms soon, darlings.

1404
01:33:22.179 --> 01:33:24.389
"But in case this letter
arrives before our return,

1405
01:33:24.473 --> 01:33:26.182
"know that we love you.

1406
01:33:27.602 --> 01:33:30.729
"It fills us with pride to know that
no matter what happens in this life,

1407
01:33:30.813 --> 01:33:34.107
"that you will take care of each other
with kindness and bravery

1408
01:33:34.191 --> 01:33:37.152
"and selflessness, as you always have.

1409
01:33:37.236 --> 01:33:40.614
"And remember one thing,
my darlings, and never forget it.

1410
01:33:41.032 --> 01:33:44.826
"That no matter where we are, know
that as long as you have each other,

1411
01:33:44.910 --> 01:33:47.996
"you have your family and you are home.

1412
01:33:48.706 --> 01:33:50.915
"Your loving parents."

1413

<i>SNICKET: Passing the torch is a rite
of passage that can take many forms.</i>

1414
01:34:13.356 --> 01:34:17.484
<i>But perhaps the least known
and most surprising</i>

1415
01:34:17.568 --> 01:34:20.278
<i>is the passing of a spyglass.</i>

1416
01:34:38.464 --> 01:34:43.301
<i>Dear reader, there are people in the
world who know no misery and woe,</i>

1417
01:34:43.386 --> 01:34:45.845
<i>and they take comfort in cheerful films</i>

1418
01:34:45.930 --> 01:34:49.099
<i>about twittering birds
and giggling elves.</i>

1419
01:34:49.183 --> 01:34:52.560
<i>There are people who know that
there's always a mystery to be solved,</i>

1420
01:34:52.645 --> 01:34:54.437
<i>and they take comfort in researching</i>

1421
01:34:54.522 --> 01:34:57.857
<i>and writing down
any important evidence.</i>

1422
01:34:59.485 --> 01:35:02.779
<i>But this story is not about such people.</i>

1423
01:35:02.863 --> 01:35:06.366
<i>This story is about the Baudelaires.</i>

1424
01:35:06.450 --> 01:35:10.870
<i>And they are the sort of people who
know that there's always something.</i>

1425
01:35:10.955 --> 01:35:14.165
<i>Something to invent, something to read,</i>

1426
01:35:14.250 --> 01:35:17.252
<i>something to bite and something to do</i>

1427
01:35:17.336 --> 01:35:21.548
<i>to make a sanctuary,
no matter how small.</i>

1428
01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:34.894
<i>And for this reason, I am happy to say,</i>

1429
01:35:34.979 --> 01:35:40.066
<i>the Baudelaires
were very fortunate indeed.</i>

1430
01:46:15.077 --> 01:46:18.954
<i>CAPTAIN SHAM:
Oh, the captain loved the ladies</i>

1431
01:46:19.039 --> 01:46:21.540

But he's on the hook for life</i>

1433
01:46:25.379 --> 01:46:29.173
<i>Well, I guess he shouldn't of oughta
But he drowned her in the water</i>

1434
01:46:29.257 --> 01:46:33.177
<i>And then a flounder downed her
That's why they never found her</i>
