"In order to affect a timely halt

3
00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:08.546
a state of emergency is declared
for these territories

4
00:01:08.615 --> 00:01:11.243

duly appointed representative

Right to verdict by a jury of peers,
suspended.

A dangerous song to be singing...

...for any who are
ignorant of its meaning.

52
00:05:57.938 --> 00:05:59.838
Particularly a woman.

53
00:06:01.408 --> 00:06:03.774
Particularly a woman alone.

54
00:06:04.544 --> 00:06:06.739
What makes you think
she's alone?

55
00:06:11.351 --> 00:06:12.841
You protect her?

56
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.220
And what makes you think
I need protecting?

57
00:06:16.623 --> 00:06:18.921
Your master's expecting us.

58
00:06:18.992 --> 00:06:23.361
And an unexpected death'd
cast a slight pall on our meeting.

59
00:06:24.965 --> 00:06:26.398
Pick those feet up!

60
00:06:28.335 --> 00:06:30.064
On the double!

61
00:06:31.471 --> 00:06:33.302
Eyes front!

62
00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:43.776
No, no, no. None.

63
00:07:11.912 --> 00:07:14.608
lt always takes me
about a week to get my sea legs.

64
00:07:14.681 --> 00:07:16.842
I was throwing up horribly
the last time.

65
00:07:28.195 --> 00:07:31.255
Steady as she goes.

66
00:07:33.633 --> 00:07:34.622
All right.

67
00:07:38.338 --> 00:07:40.238
Have you heard anything from Will?

68
00:07:40.307 --> 00:07:42.639
I trust young Turner
to acquire the charts

69
00:07:42.709 --> 00:07:46.145
and you to remember your place
in the presence of Captain Sao Feng.

70
00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.739
Is he that terrifying?

71
00:07:48.815 --> 00:07:53.752
He's much like myself, but absent my
merciful nature and sense of fair play.

72
00:08:08.768 --> 00:08:11.362
We're through. Make ready.

73
00:08:17.878 --> 00:08:19.072
Hurry now.

74
00:08:25.485 --> 00:08:29.353
Do you think because she is a woman
we would not suspect her of treachery?

75
00:08:31.691 --> 00:08:33.716
Well, when you put it that way...

76
00:08:34.394 --> 00:08:36.191
Remove. Please.

77
00:09:21.041 --> 00:09:24.067
Remove. Please.

78
00:10:09.322 --> 00:10:13.588
Captain Barbossa,
welcome to Singapore.

79
00:10:18.164 --> 00:10:19.290
More steam.

80
00:10:41.855 --> 00:10:42.844
None of that.

81
00:10:42.922 --> 00:10:46.881
If things don't go the way we want,
then we're the only chance they've got.

82
00:10:53.166 --> 00:10:57.762
I understand that you have
a request to make of me.

83
00:10:57.837 --> 00:11:00.897
More of a proposal to put to ye.

84
00:11:01.307 --> 00:11:06.711
I've a venture underway and I find
myself in need of a ship and a crew.

85
00:11:07.747 --> 00:11:11.547
Hmm. It's an odd coincidence.

86
00:11:11.618 --> 00:11:14.712
Because you happen to have
a ship and a crew you don't need?

87
00:11:14.788 --> 00:11:17.188
No.

88
00:11:17.257 --> 00:11:19.885
Because earlier this day,
not far from here,

89
00:11:19.959 --> 00:11:23.918
a thief broke into
my most revered uncle's temple

90
00:11:24.064 --> 00:11:27.090
and tried to make off with these.

91
00:11:28.735 --> 00:11:31.431
The navigational charts.

92
00:11:32.072 --> 00:11:35.803
The route to the Farthest Gate.

93
00:11:38.311 --> 00:11:42.771
Would'nt it be amazing
if this venture of yours

94
00:11:42.849 --> 00:11:46.250
took you to the world beyond this one?

95
00:11:46.319 --> 00:11:49.186
It would strain credulity at that.

96
00:12:03.236 --> 00:12:07.935
This is the thief.
Is his face familiar to you?

97
00:12:10.744 --> 00:12:14.180
Then I guess he has
no further need for it.

98
00:12:14.514 --> 00:12:15.503
No, no!

99
00:12:24.424 --> 00:12:29.327
You come into my city
and you betray my hospitality.

100
00:12:30.196 --> 00:12:33.688
- I assure you I had no idea...
- That he would get caught!

101
00:12:38.104 --> 00:12:41.267
You intend to attempt the voyage
to Davy Jones' Locker.

102
00:12:41.341 --> 00:12:43.673
But I cannot help but wonder...

103
00:12:45.345 --> 00:12:46.710
Why?

104
00:12:56.156 --> 00:13:01.890
The song has been sung.
The time is upon us.

105
00:13:02.395 --> 00:13:06.161
We must convene the Brethren Court.

106
00:13:06.232 --> 00:13:12.193
As one of the nine pirate lords,
you must honor the call.

107
00:13:14.073 --> 00:13:15.233
More steam.

108
00:13:22.215 --> 00:13:23.739
More steam!

109
00:13:30.857 --> 00:13:34.349
- There is a price on all our heads.
- Aye.

110
00:13:34.427 --> 00:13:36.327
It is true.

111
00:13:36.396 --> 00:13:39.661
It seems the only way a pirate
can turn a profit anymore...

112
00:13:41.301 --> 00:13:44.702
...is by betraying other pirates.

113
00:13:44.771 --> 00:13:47.137
We must put
our differences aside.

114
00:13:47.207 --> 00:13:48.265
Wait for the signal.

115
00:13:48.341 --> 00:13:51.504
The First Brethren Court
gave us rule of the seas.

116
00:13:51.578 --> 00:13:56.242
But now that rule is being challenged
by Lord Cutler Beckett.

117
00:13:56.382 --> 00:13:59.112
Against East India
Trading Company,

118
00:13:59.185 --> 00:14:01.847
what value is the Brethren Court?

119
00:14:02.522 --> 00:14:04.353
What can any of us do?

120
00:14:04.424 --> 00:14:07.257
You can fight!
Get off me!

121
00:14:07.327 --> 00:14:10.785
You are Sao Feng,
the pirate lord of Singapore.

122
00:14:10.864 --> 00:14:15.563
You command in an age of piracy
where bold captains sail free waters.

123
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:19.505
Where waves aren't measured in feet,
but as increments of fear,

124
00:14:19.572 --> 00:14:21.836
and those who pass the test
become legend.

125
00:14:22.475 --> 00:14:25.273
Would you have that era
come to an end on your watch?

126
00:14:25.812 --> 00:14:28.474
The most notorious pirates
from around the world

127
00:14:28.548 --> 00:14:30.539
are uniting against our enemy,

128
00:14:30.617 --> 00:14:33.711
and yet you sit here
cowering in your bathwater!

129
00:14:39.158 --> 00:14:41.058
Elizabeth Swann.

130
00:14:41.594 --> 00:14:45.291
There is more to you
than meets the eye, isn't there?

131
00:14:46.065 --> 00:14:50.024
And the eye does not go wanting.

132
00:14:51.571 --> 00:14:56.941
But I cannot help but notice
you have failed to answer my question.

133
00:14:58.278 --> 00:15:01.679
What is it you seek
in Davy Jones' Locker?

134
00:15:01.748 --> 00:15:02.942
Jack Sparrow.

135
00:15:05.985 --> 00:15:08.044
He's one of the pirate lords.

136
00:15:13.927 --> 00:15:15.417
The only reason...

137
00:15:16.429 --> 00:15:20.456
...I would want Jack Sparrow returned
from the land of the dead...

138
00:15:21.167 --> 00:15:24.500
...is so I can send him back myself!

139
00:15:28.975 --> 00:15:33.207
Jack Sparrow holds
one of the nine pieces of eight.

140
00:15:33.279 --> 00:15:36.737
He failed to pass it along
to a successor before he died.

141
00:15:36.816 --> 00:15:39.444
So we must go and get him back.

142
00:15:44.657 --> 00:15:47.990
So you admit...

143
00:15:48.328 --> 00:15:50.592
...you have deceived me.

144
00:15:50.663 --> 00:15:52.062
Weapons!

145
00:15:55.268 --> 00:15:56.462
Weapons.

146
00:15:57.136 --> 00:16:01.129
Sao Feng, I assure you,
our intentions are strictly honorable.

147
00:16:08.247 --> 00:16:11.148
Drop your weapons or I kill the man!

148
00:16:13.586 --> 00:16:15.383
Kill him. He's not our man.

149
00:16:17.457 --> 00:16:20.358
If he's not with you,
and he's not with us...

150
00:16:21.027 --> 00:16:22.927
...who's he with?

151
00:16:22.996 --> 00:16:25.396
Charge!

152
00:16:46.252 --> 00:16:47.241
Will!

153
00:17:01.634 --> 00:17:04.159
Look out! Look behind you!

154
00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.402
Ready!

155
00:17:09.976 --> 00:17:10.965
Fire.

156
00:17:20.787 --> 00:17:21.776
Chart!

157
00:17:47.447 --> 00:17:48.471
Boo!

158
00:17:52.819 --> 00:17:57.449
Company! Make ready. Set. Fire!

159
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:05.419
Company!

160
00:18:05.498 --> 00:18:07.591
Make ready. Set.

161
00:18:10.536 --> 00:18:12.731
Fire!

162
00:18:28.554 --> 00:18:30.988
It's an odd coincidence, isn't it?

163
00:18:31.057 --> 00:18:35.994
The East India Trading Company finds me
the day you show up in Singapore.

164
00:18:36.062 --> 00:18:37.495
It is coincidence only.

165
00:18:41.234 --> 00:18:45.102
If you want to make a deal with Beckett,
you need what I offer.

166
00:18:46.339 --> 00:18:50.833
You cross Barbossa.
You are willing to cross Jack Sparrow.

167
00:18:51.277 --> 00:18:53.939
Why should I expect any better?

168
00:18:54.013 --> 00:18:56.880
I need the Black Pearl
to free my father.

169
00:19:00.153 --> 00:19:01.780
You're helping me to get it.

170
00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:12.363
Uh-oh.

171
00:19:17.703 --> 00:19:19.170
Fire in the hole.

172
00:19:37.356 --> 00:19:38.550
Thank you, Jack.

173
00:19:38.624 --> 00:19:40.717
Thank you, Jack.

174
00:19:42.962 --> 00:19:45.760
- You have the charts?
- And better yet.

175
00:19:46.399 --> 00:19:49.163
- A ship and a crew.
- Where's Sao Feng?

176
00:19:49.235 --> 00:19:52.068
He'll cover our escape
and meet us at Shipwreck Cove.

177
00:19:52.138 --> 00:19:53.969
This way. Be quick.

178
00:20:00.313 --> 00:20:03.009
Haul the snotters with a will!

179
00:20:03.082 --> 00:20:04.777
Keep it taut.

180
00:20:05.851 --> 00:20:08.843
Secure provisions
and stow the cargo.

181
00:20:08.921 --> 00:20:11.754
There's no place left
for Sao Feng to cower.

182
00:20:12.358 --> 00:20:14.724
Do you think he will honor the call?

183
00:20:15.294 --> 00:20:17.262
I cannot say.

184
00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:20.394
There's an evil on these seas

185
00:20:20.466 --> 00:20:25.802
that even the most staunch and
bloodthirsty pirates have come to fear.

186
00:21:32.905 --> 00:21:34.372
A piece of eight.

187
00:21:35.107 --> 00:21:36.836
Nine of them, you say.

188
00:21:36.909 --> 00:21:40.003
Our new friend in Singapore
was very specific, sir.

189
00:21:40.079 --> 00:21:41.671
Nine pieces of eight.

190
00:21:41.747 --> 00:21:44.307
What's the significance of that,
I wonder.

191
00:21:44.383 --> 00:21:46.715
Nothing can hold against the armada.

192
00:21:46.786 --> 00:21:49.016
Not with the Flying Dutchman
at the lead.

193
00:21:49.088 --> 00:21:50.612
Nothing we know of.

194
00:21:51.991 --> 00:21:55.324
Did your friend mention
where the Brethren Court are meeting?

195
00:21:55.394 --> 00:21:58.124
He was mum on that, sir.

196
00:21:58.197 --> 00:21:59.664
Hmm.

197
00:21:59.732 --> 00:22:02.166
Then he knows the value of information.

198
00:22:02.234 --> 00:22:05.032
Better keep this between ourselves.

199
00:22:05.104 --> 00:22:08.403
We don't want anyone
running off to Singapore, do we?

200
00:22:10.276 --> 00:22:15.009
- Ah, admiral.
- You summoned me, Lord Beckett.

201
00:22:15.081 --> 00:22:17.811
Yes. Something for you there.

202
00:22:17.883 --> 00:22:21.250
Your new station deserves an old friend.

203
00:22:35.034 --> 00:22:38.367
- Not more requisition orders.
- No, sir.

204
00:22:38.437 --> 00:22:39.995
Execution.

205
00:22:45.878 --> 00:22:48.073
The Brethren know they face extinction.

206
00:22:49.081 --> 00:22:53.450
All that remains is for them to decide
where they make their final stand.

207
00:23:18.244 --> 00:23:21.441
No one said anything about cold.

208
00:23:21.514 --> 00:23:25.280
I'm sure there must be
a good reason for our suffering.

209
00:23:26.285 --> 00:23:29.220
Why don't that obeah woman
bring Jack back the same way

210
00:23:29.288 --> 00:23:33.816
- she brought back Barbossa?
- Because Barbossa was only dead.

211
00:23:35.127 --> 00:23:39.393
Jack Sparrow is taken, body and soul,

212
00:23:39.465 --> 00:23:44.630
to a place not of death, but punishment.

213
00:23:44.703 --> 00:23:48.537
The worst fate a person
can bring upon himself...

214
00:23:48.974 --> 00:23:51.204
...stretching on forever.

215
00:23:51.644 --> 00:23:55.136
That's what awaits
at Davy Jones' Locker.

216
00:23:59.318 --> 00:24:02.685
Yeah. I knew there was a good reason.

217
00:24:13.666 --> 00:24:15.930
Nothing here is set.

218
00:24:17.136 --> 00:24:19.297
These can't be
as accurate as modern charts.

219
00:24:19.371 --> 00:24:24.035
No. But it leads to more places.

220
00:24:30.115 --> 00:24:31.639
"Over the edge.

221
00:24:31.717 --> 00:24:34.151
Over again."

222
00:24:35.988 --> 00:24:38.684
"Sunrise sets.

223
00:24:38.757 --> 00:24:41.749
Flash of green."

224
00:24:42.628 --> 00:24:46.621
Do you care to interpret,
Captain Barbossa?

225
00:24:47.433 --> 00:24:52.302
Ever gazed upon the green flash,
Master Gibbs?

226
00:24:52.371 --> 00:24:56.933
I reckon I seen my fair share.
Happens on rare occasion.

227
00:24:57.009 --> 00:25:00.809
The last glimpse of sunset,
a green flash shoots up into the sky.

228
00:25:01.213 --> 00:25:04.205
Some go their whole lives
without ever seeing it.

229
00:25:04.283 --> 00:25:07.116
Some claim to have seen it who ain't.
And some say...

230
00:25:07.186 --> 00:25:11.350
It signals when a soul
comes back to this world from the dead.

231
00:25:15.928 --> 00:25:19.523
- Sorry.
- Trust me, young Master Turner.

232
00:25:19.598 --> 00:25:22.931
It's not getting to the land
of the dead that's the problem.

233
00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:26.933
It's getting back.

234
00:26:07.479 --> 00:26:07.580
Bosun!
Head to wind! Lift the sail!

235
00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:12.176
Bosun!
Head to wind! Lift the sail!

236
00:26:12.251 --> 00:26:13.479
Aye, aye, sir!

237
00:26:15.654 --> 00:26:18.748
Bloody hell. There's nothing left.

238
00:26:18.824 --> 00:26:22.191
Jones is a loose cannon, sir.

239
00:26:22.661 --> 00:26:24.629
Fetch the chest.

240
00:26:25.331 --> 00:26:27.492
And the governor?

241
00:26:28.267 --> 00:26:32.033
He's been asking questions
about the heart.

242
00:26:32.605 --> 00:26:34.436
Does he know?

243
00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:41.673
Then perhaps his usefulness
has run its course.

244
00:27:41.907 --> 00:27:43.932
Step lively, men.

245
00:27:44.376 --> 00:27:45.934
Step lively!

246
00:27:48.013 --> 00:27:49.207
Stand fast!

247
00:27:55.921 --> 00:27:57.616
Steady, men.

248
00:28:03.395 --> 00:28:09.265
Go. All of you.
And take that infernal thing with you.

249
00:28:09.334 --> 00:28:12.303
I will not have it on my ship!

250
00:28:12.371 --> 00:28:15.898
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that...
because I will.

251
00:28:15.974 --> 00:28:18.875
Because it seems to be
the only way to ensure

252
00:28:18.944 --> 00:28:22.345
that this ship do as directed
by the company.

253
00:28:27.553 --> 00:28:29.987
We need prisoners to interrogate,

254
00:28:30.055 --> 00:28:33.252
which tends to work best
when they're alive.

255
00:28:33.325 --> 00:28:37.227
The Dutchman sails
as its captain commands.

256
00:28:37.296 --> 00:28:41.198
And its captain
is to sail it as commanded.

257
00:28:43.802 --> 00:28:47.898
I would have thought you'd learned that
when I ordered you to kill your pet.

258
00:28:48.874 --> 00:28:52.571
This is no longer your world, Jones.

259
00:28:53.412 --> 00:28:56.779
The immaterial has become...

260
00:28:57.916 --> 00:28:59.645
...immaterial.

261
00:29:00.753 --> 00:29:02.846
Charge your bayonets.

262
00:29:41.827 --> 00:29:44.227
How long do we continue not talking?

263
00:29:48.233 --> 00:29:50.758
Once we rescue Jack,
everything'll be fine.

264
00:29:53.872 --> 00:29:55.305
Then we rescue Jack.

265
00:30:20.599 --> 00:30:23.796
For what we want most...

266
00:30:25.804 --> 00:30:29.103
...there is a cost
must be paid in the end.

267
00:30:40.385 --> 00:30:45.322
- Barbossa, ahead!
- Aye, we're good and lost now.

268
00:30:46.225 --> 00:30:48.853
- Lost?
- For certain you have to be lost

269
00:30:48.927 --> 00:30:50.918
to find a place as can't be found.

270
00:30:50.996 --> 00:30:53.362
Elseways, everyone
would know where it was.

271
00:30:53.632 --> 00:30:56.100
- We're gaining speed.
- Aye.

272
00:30:57.102 --> 00:30:58.694
To stations!

273
00:30:59.805 --> 00:31:01.204
All hands to stations!

274
00:31:01.273 --> 00:31:04.037
Huh?

275
00:31:04.109 --> 00:31:07.010
Rudder full. Hard aport! Gather way.

276
00:31:07.079 --> 00:31:11.914
Nay! Belay that!
Let her run straight and true!

277
00:31:13.819 --> 00:31:15.047
Blimey.

278
00:31:29.067 --> 00:31:32.434
- You've doomed us all.
- Don't be so unkind.

279
00:31:32.504 --> 00:31:35.166
You may not survive
to pass this way again,

280
00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:39.074
and these be the last
friendly words you'll hear.

281
00:31:43.849 --> 00:31:45.077
Tie her off.

282
00:31:50.756 --> 00:31:52.451
Hard aport.

283
00:32:01.199 --> 00:32:03.224
Hold on!

284
00:32:35.167 --> 00:32:39.797
Strike your colors,
you blooming cockroaches.

285
00:32:39.871 --> 00:32:45.400
Dead men tell no tales.

286
00:33:33.592 --> 00:33:35.025
My peanut.

287
00:33:36.628 --> 00:33:38.687
Haul the halyard. Slacken braces.

288
00:33:38.764 --> 00:33:41.062
Aye, captain.
Slacken braces.

289
00:33:41.133 --> 00:33:43.260
Step lively with a will.

290
00:33:43.335 --> 00:33:44.927
- Aye, aye.
- Right away, sir.

291
00:33:45.003 --> 00:33:46.698
I want a fire down below!

292
00:33:49.808 --> 00:33:53.539
- Help.
- Man the yards, you filthy toads.

293
00:34:04.523 --> 00:34:08.323
Haul! Haul!

294
00:34:08.393 --> 00:34:11.260
Haul the sheets handsomely.
Scandalize the lateens.

295
00:34:11.329 --> 00:34:13.126
- Aye, sir.
- Right away, sir.

296
00:34:27.145 --> 00:34:29.113
- Mr. Sparrow?
- Aye, cap'n.

297
00:34:29.881 --> 00:34:32.611
What say you about
the condition of this tack line?

298
00:34:33.318 --> 00:34:36.754
- It be proper to my eyes, sir.
- Proper?

299
00:34:36.822 --> 00:34:40.690
It is neither proper nor suitable, sir.
It is not acceptable nor adequate.

300
00:34:40.759 --> 00:34:43.193
It is, in obvious fact, an abomination.

301
00:34:43.261 --> 00:34:46.788
Begging your pardon, sir,
but if you gave a man another chance.

302
00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:49.133
Shall I?

303
00:34:53.105 --> 00:34:56.165
It's that sort of thinking
got us into this mess.

304
00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:01.777
We have lost speed and, therefore, time.

305
00:35:01.847 --> 00:35:06.079
Precious time,
which cannot be recovered once lost.

306
00:35:06.151 --> 00:35:07.948
Do you understand?

307
00:35:08.019 --> 00:35:11.147
- Aye, aye, captain.
- Do you now?

308
00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:14.887
It will all have to be redone.
All of it.

309
00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.428
And let this serve
as a lesson to the lot of you.

310
00:35:17.496 --> 00:35:20.988
Doldrums, sir,
has the entire crew on edge.

311
00:35:21.066 --> 00:35:24.035
I have no sympathy
for any of you feculent maggots,

312
00:35:24.102 --> 00:35:27.003
and no more patience
to pretend otherwise.

313
00:35:29.808 --> 00:35:33.801
Gentlemen, I wash my hands
of this weirdness.

314
00:35:44.356 --> 00:35:45.755
No wind.

315
00:35:46.258 --> 00:35:48.226
Of course, there's no bloody wind.

316
00:35:49.861 --> 00:35:52.329
My soul I do swear for a breeze.

317
00:35:52.397 --> 00:35:57.232
Gust. Whisper. A tiny, miniature lick.

318
00:36:10.015 --> 00:36:12.506
Yes, sir, I know, but why?
Why would he do that?

319
00:36:12.584 --> 00:36:14.279
Because he's a lummox, isn't he?

320
00:36:14.352 --> 00:36:18.049
We shall have a magnificent
garden party and you're not invited.

321
00:36:31.303 --> 00:36:32.736
Shoo.

322
00:36:51.756 --> 00:36:53.018
A rock.

323
00:37:20.318 --> 00:37:23.879
Now we're being followed by rocks.
Never had that before.

324
00:37:24.189 --> 00:37:25.178
Oh.

325
00:37:26.658 --> 00:37:28.216
A rope.

326
00:39:48.933 --> 00:39:52.027
This truly is a godforsaken place.

327
00:39:52.804 --> 00:39:55.864
I don't see Jack.
I don't see anyone.

328
00:39:57.208 --> 00:39:58.835
He's here.

329
00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:02.209
Davy Jones never once
gave up that what he took.

330
00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:03.713
And does it matter?

331
00:40:03.782 --> 00:40:06.842
We're trapped here by your doing.
No different than Jack.

332
00:40:10.021 --> 00:40:15.186
Witty Jack is closer than you think.

333
00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.358
Impossible.

334
00:41:03.007 --> 00:41:03.996
Boat.

335
00:41:10.381 --> 00:41:14.283
Slap me thrice
and hand me to me mama. It's Jack.

336
00:41:23.428 --> 00:41:26.124
- It's the captain!
- A sight for sore eyes.

337
00:41:26.197 --> 00:41:27.289
Hide the rum.

338
00:41:27.365 --> 00:41:29.299
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Aye, cap'n.

339
00:41:29.367 --> 00:41:30.732
I thought so.

340
00:41:30.802 --> 00:41:33.771
I expect you're able
to account for your actions, then.

341
00:41:33.838 --> 00:41:34.827
Sir?

342
00:41:34.906 --> 00:41:38.933
There's been a perpetual and virulent
lack of discipline upon my vessel. Why?

343
00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:41.342
- Why is that, sir?
- Sir, you're...

344
00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:44.978
You're in Davy Jones' Locker, cap'n.

345
00:41:48.686 --> 00:41:51.985
I know that.
I know where I am.

346
00:41:52.056 --> 00:41:56.288
- And don't think I don't.
- Jack Sparrow.

347
00:41:56.995 --> 00:41:58.860
Oh, Hector.

348
00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:00.864
It's been too long. Has'nt it?

349
00:42:00.932 --> 00:42:05.733
Aye. Isla de Muerta, remember?
You shot me.

350
00:42:07.138 --> 00:42:09.003
No, I didn't.

351
00:42:09.073 --> 00:42:11.166
Tia Dalma, out and about, eh?

352
00:42:11.242 --> 00:42:15.144
You add an agreeable sense
of the macabre to any delirium.

353
00:42:16.481 --> 00:42:18.381
He thinks we're a hallucination.

354
00:42:19.284 --> 00:42:20.945
William, tell me something:

355
00:42:21.019 --> 00:42:25.046
Have you come because you need my help
to save a certain distressing damsel,

356
00:42:25.123 --> 00:42:28.684
or rather, damsel in distress?
Either one.

357
00:42:29.227 --> 00:42:30.216
No.

358
00:42:30.295 --> 00:42:32.729
Well, then,
you wouldn't be here, would you?

359
00:42:32.797 --> 00:42:36.790
So you can't be here.
Q.E.D., you're not really here.

360
00:42:36.868 --> 00:42:38.233
Jack.

361
00:42:40.405 --> 00:42:42.339
This is real. We're here.

362
00:42:53.318 --> 00:42:55.980
- The Locker, you say?
- Aye.

363
00:42:56.421 --> 00:42:58.719
We've come to rescue you.

364
00:43:00.325 --> 00:43:03.852
Have you, now?
That's very kind of you.

365
00:43:03.928 --> 00:43:07.261
But it would seem that
as I possess a ship and you don't,

366
00:43:07.398 --> 00:43:11.494
you're the ones in need of rescuing,
and I'm not sure as I'm in the mood.

367
00:43:12.337 --> 00:43:15.864
I see my ship. Right there.

368
00:43:19.377 --> 00:43:20.901
Can't spot it.

369
00:43:20.979 --> 00:43:24.312
Must be a tiny little thing
hiding somewhere behind the Pearl.

370
00:43:24.382 --> 00:43:27.180
Jack, Cutler Beckett
has the heart of Davy Jones.

371
00:43:27.251 --> 00:43:30.618
- He controls the Flying Dutchman.
- He's taking over the seas.

372
00:43:30.688 --> 00:43:33.555
The song has been sung.
The Brethren Court is called.

373
00:43:33.625 --> 00:43:37.425
Leave you alone for a minute, look
what happens. Everything's gone to pot.

374
00:43:37.495 --> 00:43:40.157
Aye. The world
needs you back something fierce.

375
00:43:40.231 --> 00:43:42.028
And you need a crew.

376
00:43:44.135 --> 00:43:46.330
Why should I sail with any of you?

377
00:43:46.404 --> 00:43:49.896
Four of you have tried to kill me
in the past. One of you succeeded.

378
00:43:53.645 --> 00:43:57.081
Oh, she's not told you.

379
00:43:57.148 --> 00:43:59.981
You'll have loads to talk about
while you're here.

380
00:44:01.352 --> 00:44:02.819
As for you...

381
00:44:04.055 --> 00:44:09.925
Now... don't tell me
you didn't enjoy it at the time.

382
00:44:10.895 --> 00:44:12.954
Fair enough. All right, you're in.

383
00:44:13.031 --> 00:44:14.965
Don't need you. You scare me.

384
00:44:15.033 --> 00:44:18.901
Gibbs, you can come. Marty. Mm...

385
00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:20.631
Cotton.

386
00:44:20.705 --> 00:44:25.233
Cottors parrot, I'm a little iffy, but
at least I'll have someone to talk to.

387
00:44:26.411 --> 00:44:27.708
Who are you?

388
00:44:27.779 --> 00:44:30.077
Tai Huang. These are my men.

389
00:44:30.748 --> 00:44:34.582
- Where do your allegiances lie?
- With the highest bidder.

390
00:44:35.019 --> 00:44:38.682
- I have a ship.
- That makes you the highest bidder.

391
00:44:38.756 --> 00:44:42.783
Good man. Weigh anchor, all hands.
Prepare to make sail.

392
00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:44.054
Weigh anchor.

393
00:44:47.632 --> 00:44:49.224
Jack...

394
00:44:50.568 --> 00:44:54.163
Which way are you going, Jack?

395
00:44:56.307 --> 00:44:59.606
Trim that sail.
Slack windward brace and sheet.

396
00:44:59.677 --> 00:45:02.237
- Haul the pennant line.
- Haul the pennant line.

397
00:45:02.313 --> 00:45:03.746
What are you doing?

398
00:45:03.815 --> 00:45:06.409
- What are you doing?
- No, what are you doing?

399
00:45:06.484 --> 00:45:09.248
- What are you doing?
- No, what are you doing?

400
00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:11.811
What are you?
Captain gives orders on the ship.

401
00:45:11.889 --> 00:45:14.050
The captain of the ship
is giving orders.

402
00:45:14.625 --> 00:45:17.617
- My ship, makes me captain.
- They be my charts.

403
00:45:17.695 --> 00:45:20.186
That makes you "chartman."

404
00:45:20.264 --> 00:45:25.167
Stow it! The both of you!
That's an order! Understand?!

405
00:45:31.008 --> 00:45:34.205
Sorry. I just thought
with the captain issue in doubt,

406
00:45:34.278 --> 00:45:37.213
I'd throw in my name for consideration.

407
00:45:37.281 --> 00:45:38.543
Sorry.

408
00:45:43.287 --> 00:45:45.585
- I'd vote for you.
- Yeah?

409
00:46:20.992 --> 00:46:22.857
You left Jack to the Kraken.

410
00:46:23.928 --> 00:46:26.055
He's rescued now. It's done with.

411
00:46:29.233 --> 00:46:31.201
Will, I had no choice.

412
00:46:32.436 --> 00:46:34.301
You chose not to tell me.

413
00:46:35.239 --> 00:46:36.968
I couldn't.

414
00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:39.901
It wasn't your burden to bear.

415
00:46:40.912 --> 00:46:42.777
But I did bear it, didn't I?

416
00:46:44.482 --> 00:46:46.347
I just didn't know what it was.

417
00:46:47.151 --> 00:46:48.778
I thought...

418
00:46:49.954 --> 00:46:51.945
You thought I loved him.

419
00:47:00.464 --> 00:47:04.298
If you make your choices alone,
how can I trust you?

420
00:47:07.305 --> 00:47:08.602
You can't.

421
00:47:37.168 --> 00:47:38.328
Eerie.

422
00:47:40.104 --> 00:47:42.265
That's downright macabre.

423
00:47:47.812 --> 00:47:51.475
I wonder what would happen if you
dropped a cannonball on one of them?

424
00:48:01.392 --> 00:48:03.587
Be disrespectful, it would.

425
00:48:03.661 --> 00:48:07.427
They should be
in the care of Davy Jones.

426
00:48:09.066 --> 00:48:12.229
That was the duty
him was charged with...

427
00:48:12.536 --> 00:48:15.232
...by the goddess, Calypso.

428
00:48:17.108 --> 00:48:20.908
To ferry those who die at sea
to the other side.

429
00:48:24.215 --> 00:48:26.183
And every ten years...

430
00:48:26.984 --> 00:48:29.111
...him could come ashore...

431
00:48:30.154 --> 00:48:34.454
...to be with she
who love him... truly.

432
00:48:38.796 --> 00:48:41.390
But the man has become a monster.

433
00:48:41.999 --> 00:48:46.026
So he wasn't always... tentacley?

434
00:48:48.139 --> 00:48:49.299
No.

435
00:48:51.509 --> 00:48:53.909
Him was a man...

436
00:48:53.978 --> 00:48:55.969
...once.

437
00:49:03.287 --> 00:49:05.312
Now there's boats coming.

438
00:49:12.997 --> 00:49:15.761
They're not a threat to us. Am I right?

439
00:49:16.367 --> 00:49:18.961
We are nothing but ghosts to them.

440
00:49:19.036 --> 00:49:21.300
It's best just let them be.

441
00:49:35.786 --> 00:49:38.254
It's my father. We've made it back.

442
00:49:38.322 --> 00:49:40.882
Father! Father, here, look here!

443
00:49:42.693 --> 00:49:43.785
Elizabeth.

444
00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:47.254
We're not back.

445
00:49:54.372 --> 00:49:55.396
Father!

446
00:49:58.676 --> 00:50:02.168
Elizabeth. Are you dead?

447
00:50:03.414 --> 00:50:04.745
No. No.

448
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:07.445
I think I am.

449
00:50:07.518 --> 00:50:09.509
No, you can't be.

450
00:50:10.654 --> 00:50:13.521
There was this chest, you see.

451
00:50:14.291 --> 00:50:17.954
It's odd.
At the time it seemed so important.

452
00:50:18.629 --> 00:50:19.857
Come aboard.

453
00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:21.693
And a heart.

454
00:50:21.766 --> 00:50:27.033
I learned that if you stab the heart,
yours must take its place.

455
00:50:27.104 --> 00:50:30.631
And you will sail the seas for eternity.

456
00:50:30.708 --> 00:50:33.700
The Dutchman must have a captain.

457
00:50:34.779 --> 00:50:36.770
Silly thing to die for.

458
00:50:37.148 --> 00:50:40.379
Someone, cast a line.
Come back with us!

459
00:50:42.219 --> 00:50:43.311
Come on.

460
00:50:44.388 --> 00:50:48.620
A touch... of destiny.

461
00:50:51.495 --> 00:50:52.792
Take the line.

462
00:50:55.299 --> 00:50:57.494
I'm so proud of you, Elizabeth.

463
00:50:57.568 --> 00:50:59.297
Father, the line! Take the line!

464
00:51:03.107 --> 00:51:05.439
- She must not leave the ship!
- Father!

465
00:51:05.509 --> 00:51:09.775
Please come with us!
Please! No! I won't leave you!

466
00:51:10.414 --> 00:51:12.405
I'll give your love to your mother.

467
00:51:12.483 --> 00:51:15.350
- Please, I won't let you go!
- Elizabeth.

468
00:51:15.419 --> 00:51:17.478
Elizabeth.

469
00:51:23.594 --> 00:51:24.856
Is there a way?

470
00:51:29.667 --> 00:51:31.362
Him at peace.

471
00:51:38.776 --> 00:51:40.334
No water.

472
00:51:41.479 --> 00:51:43.572
Why is all but the rum gone?

473
00:51:45.216 --> 00:51:46.649
Rum's gone too.

474
00:51:54.825 --> 00:51:59.455
If we cannot escape
these doldrums before night,

475
00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:03.432
I fear we will sail on trackless seas.

476
00:52:03.501 --> 00:52:06.732
Doomed to roam the reach between worlds.

477
00:52:07.538 --> 00:52:08.630
Forever.

478
00:52:08.706 --> 00:52:12.665
With no water, forever
looks to be arriving a mite too soon.

479
00:52:13.244 --> 00:52:14.973
Why doesn't he do something?

480
00:52:15.379 --> 00:52:18.246
- Me eye. Give it back!
- There's no sense to it.

481
00:52:18.315 --> 00:52:22.649
And the green flash
happens at sunset, not sunrise.

482
00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:27.684
"Over the edge." Ah, it's
driving me over the blooming edge.

483
00:52:28.325 --> 00:52:30.293
Sunrises don't set.

484
00:52:34.798 --> 00:52:36.698
"Up is down."

485
00:52:36.767 --> 00:52:39.258
Well, that's just maddeningly un-helpful.

486
00:52:39.336 --> 00:52:41.304
Why are these things never clear?

487
00:52:41.372 --> 00:52:44.205
- Clear as mud, Jackie.
- What? Eh?

488
00:52:47.878 --> 00:52:50.369
- Stab the heart.
- Don't stab the heart.

489
00:52:50.447 --> 00:52:53.610
- Come again?
- The Dutchman must have a captain.

490
00:52:53.684 --> 00:52:56.209
That's even more
than less than un-helpful.

491
00:52:56.287 --> 00:52:59.051
Sail the seas for eternity.

492
00:52:59.123 --> 00:53:02.058
- I love the sea.
- What about port?

493
00:53:02.126 --> 00:53:04.117
I prefer rum. Rum's good.

494
00:53:04.195 --> 00:53:09.189
Making port. Where we can get rum,
and salty wenches...

495
00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:13.195
- Once every 10 years.
- What'd he say?

496
00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:16.728
- Once every 10 years.
- Ten years is a long time, mate.

497
00:53:16.807 --> 00:53:19.139
Even longer given the deficit of rum.

498
00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:21.474
But eternity is longer still.

499
00:53:22.213 --> 00:53:25.239
And how will you be spending it? Dead?

500
00:53:25.916 --> 00:53:27.315
Or not?

501
00:53:27.384 --> 00:53:31.252
- The immortal Captain Sparrow.
- Oh, I like that.

502
00:53:31.555 --> 00:53:33.887
Come sunset, it won't matter.

503
00:53:36.694 --> 00:53:38.389
Not sunset.

504
00:53:41.665 --> 00:53:42.859
Sundown.

505
00:53:43.834 --> 00:53:46.359
And rise. Up.

506
00:53:47.638 --> 00:53:48.832
What's that?

507
00:53:51.642 --> 00:53:54.770
What is that?
I don't know. What do you think?

508
00:53:54.845 --> 00:53:56.540
- Where?
- There.

509
00:54:18.335 --> 00:54:19.666
What is it?

510
00:54:31.715 --> 00:54:33.546
He's rocking the ship.

511
00:54:33.884 --> 00:54:35.511
We're rocking the ship.

512
00:54:39.623 --> 00:54:42.490
Aye. He's onto it.

513
00:54:44.795 --> 00:54:46.524
He's rocking the ship.

514
00:54:46.597 --> 00:54:48.997
We'll tie each other
to the mast upside down,

515
00:54:49.066 --> 00:54:51.728
so when the boat flips
we'll be the right way up.

516
00:54:52.836 --> 00:54:54.360
Time it with the swell.

517
00:54:56.006 --> 00:54:59.703
Loose the cannons, you lazy bilge rats.

518
00:55:01.445 --> 00:55:05.074
Unstow the cargo. Let it shift.

519
00:56:10.047 --> 00:56:11.412
Now up...

520
00:56:12.983 --> 00:56:14.314
...is down.

521
00:57:50.314 --> 00:57:52.305
This was your idea.

522
00:57:53.884 --> 00:57:56.375
Blessed sweet westerlies!

523
00:57:57.521 --> 00:57:58.510
We're back!

524
00:58:02.326 --> 00:58:03.623
It's the sunrise.

525
00:58:16.773 --> 00:58:18.764
Parley?

526
00:58:18.842 --> 00:58:21.310
We need our pistols!
Get untied, hurry!

527
00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:38.159
All right, then!

528
00:58:38.228 --> 00:58:41.356
The Brethren Court
is a-gathering at Shipwreck Cove.

529
00:58:41.431 --> 00:58:45.128
And, Jack, you and I are a-going.
There'll be no arguing that point.

530
00:58:45.202 --> 00:58:46.601
I is arguing the point.

531
00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:50.299
If there's pirates a-gathering,
I'm pointing my ship the other way.

532
00:58:50.374 --> 00:58:53.810
The pirates are gathering
to fight Beckett, and you're a pirate.

533
00:58:53.877 --> 00:58:56.175
Fight or not,
you're not running, Jack.

534
00:58:56.246 --> 00:58:59.272
If we don't stand together,
they'll hunt us down one by one,

535
00:58:59.349 --> 00:59:00.976
till there be none left but you.

536
00:59:01.885 --> 00:59:07.346
Quite like the sound of that.
Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate.

537
00:59:07.424 --> 00:59:08.448
Aye.

538
00:59:08.959 --> 00:59:13.328
And you'll be fighting Jones alone.
How does that figure into your plan?

539
00:59:13.397 --> 00:59:15.388
I'm still working on that.

540
00:59:15.465 --> 00:59:19.959
But I will not be going back
to the Locker, mate. Count on that.

541
00:59:25.642 --> 00:59:26.973
Wet powder.

542
00:59:29.713 --> 00:59:33.240
Wait! We can still use them as clubs!

543
00:59:35.252 --> 00:59:37.777
- Ow!
- Sorry. Effective, though.

544
00:59:38.889 --> 00:59:40.914
There's fresh water on this island.

545
00:59:40.991 --> 00:59:44.620
We can re-supply there and get back
to shooting each other later.

546
00:59:44.928 --> 00:59:47.726
You lead the shore party.
I'll stay with my ship.

547
00:59:48.198 --> 00:59:50.632
I'll not be leaving
my ship in your command.

548
00:59:50.701 --> 00:59:54.330
Why don't you both go ashore
and leave the ship in my command.

549
00:59:55.572 --> 00:59:56.903
Temporarily.

550
01:00:14.725 --> 01:00:16.283
Mind the boat.

551
01:00:27.337 --> 01:00:30.238
- Criminy.
- Odds bodkins!

552
01:00:49.259 --> 01:00:51.250
Careful! Careful!

553
01:00:52.796 --> 01:00:54.696
You stupid fish!

554
01:00:54.831 --> 01:00:56.799
Actually it's a cephalopod.

555
01:00:57.267 --> 01:00:58.461
Serves you right.

556
01:00:58.602 --> 01:01:01.594
Pin, I bet people
would pay a shilling to see this.

557
01:01:01.672 --> 01:01:04.835
And another shilling
for a sketch of them sitting atop!

558
01:01:04.908 --> 01:01:07.934
Pintel and Ragetti, Kraken slayers.

559
01:01:08.011 --> 01:01:10.844
We could serve up
a slice as a souvenir.

560
01:01:10.914 --> 01:01:13.508
Still thinking of running, Jack?

561
01:01:14.284 --> 01:01:16.775
Think you can outrun the world?

562
01:01:22.459 --> 01:01:26.293
You know, the problem
with being the last of anything...

563
01:01:26.363 --> 01:01:29.059
...by and by, there be none left at all.

564
01:01:30.467 --> 01:01:35.461
Sometimes things come back, mate.
We're living proof, you and me.

565
01:01:35.539 --> 01:01:38.667
Aye, but that's a gamble
of long odds, ain't it?

566
01:01:39.376 --> 01:01:42.038
There's never
a guarantee of coming back.

567
01:01:42.546 --> 01:01:45.208
But passing on, that's dead certain.

568
01:01:48.585 --> 01:01:51.577
Summoning the Brethren Court,
then, is it?

569
01:01:51.655 --> 01:01:53.384
It's our only hope, lad.

570
01:01:54.791 --> 01:01:57.783
That's a sad commentary
in and of itself.

571
01:01:59.429 --> 01:02:02.091
The world used to be a bigger place.

572
01:02:04.768 --> 01:02:06.668
The world's still the same.

573
01:02:08.605 --> 01:02:11.369
There's just... less in it.

574
01:02:33.663 --> 01:02:35.995
Poisoned. Fouled by the body.

575
01:02:38.802 --> 01:02:42.602
Eh, I know him. He was in Singapore!

576
01:02:42.672 --> 01:02:44.663
- Singapore.
- Captain!

577
01:02:47.511 --> 01:02:48.603
Hoy!

578
01:02:49.679 --> 01:02:51.476
We got company!

579
01:03:02.959 --> 01:03:04.654
He's the captain.

580
01:03:15.105 --> 01:03:16.402
Sao Feng...

581
01:03:16.473 --> 01:03:20.967
...you showing up here,
it is truly a remarkable coincidence.

582
01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:25.407
Jack Sparrow.

583
01:03:27.384 --> 01:03:29.477
You paid me great insult once.

584
01:03:29.553 --> 01:03:31.043
That doesn't sound like me.

585
01:03:35.959 --> 01:03:38.120
Shall we just call it square, then?

586
01:03:38.662 --> 01:03:39.822
Release her.

587
01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:44.464
- She's not part of the bargain.
- And what bargain be that?

588
01:03:45.335 --> 01:03:47.326
You heard Captain Turner.

589
01:03:48.872 --> 01:03:51.466
- Release her!
- "Captain Turner"?

590
01:03:51.541 --> 01:03:54.305
Aye, the perfidious rotter
led a mutiny against us!

591
01:03:54.377 --> 01:03:56.937
I need the Pearl to free my father.

592
01:03:57.013 --> 01:03:59.504
That's the only reason
I came on this voyage.

593
01:04:00.050 --> 01:04:02.883
Why didn't you tell me
you were planning this?

594
01:04:02.953 --> 01:04:05.148
It was my burden to bear.

595
01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:11.690
He needs the Pearl.
Captain Turner needs the Pearl.

596
01:04:11.761 --> 01:04:15.822
And you felt guilty.
And you and your Brethren Court.

597
01:04:16.867 --> 01:04:19.802
Did no one come to save me
just because they missed me?

598
01:04:29.012 --> 01:04:30.479
I'm standing with them.

599
01:04:32.649 --> 01:04:38.315
I'm sorry, Jack, but there is an
old friend who wants to see you first.

600
01:04:38.388 --> 01:04:42.017
I'm not certain I can survive
any more visits from old friends.

601
01:04:44.427 --> 01:04:46.657
Here is your chance to find out.

602
01:04:56.072 --> 01:04:57.733
Curious.

603
01:04:57.807 --> 01:05:00.970
Your friends appear
to be quite desperate, Jack.

604
01:05:01.044 --> 01:05:05.572
Perhaps they no longer believe that
a gathering of squabbling pirates

605
01:05:05.649 --> 01:05:07.617
can defeat the Flying Dutchman.

606
01:05:08.351 --> 01:05:11.787
And so despair leads to betrayal.

607
01:05:12.188 --> 01:05:16.181
But you and I are no strangers
to betrayal, are we?

608
01:05:18.962 --> 01:05:20.452
It's not here, Jack.

609
01:05:21.865 --> 01:05:23.264
What? What isn't?

610
01:05:23.333 --> 01:05:27.827
The heart of Davy Jones.
It's safely aboard the Dutchman,

611
01:05:27.904 --> 01:05:30.930
and so unavailable for use as leverage

612
01:05:31.007 --> 01:05:33.669
to satisfy your debt
to the good captain.

613
01:05:33.743 --> 01:05:37.008
By my reckoning,
that account has been settled.

614
01:05:37.147 --> 01:05:39.206
By your death?

615
01:05:39.282 --> 01:05:41.341
And yet here you are.

616
01:05:41.885 --> 01:05:44.513
Close your eyes
and pretend it's all a bad dream.

617
01:05:44.587 --> 01:05:46.020
That's how I get by.

618
01:05:46.923 --> 01:05:50.552
And if Davy Jones
were to learn of your survival?

619
01:05:51.161 --> 01:05:52.628
Ship oars.

620
01:05:52.696 --> 01:05:54.254
Ship oars.

621
01:05:54.564 --> 01:05:56.156
Be on your guard, men.

622
01:05:58.802 --> 01:06:00.667
My men are crew enough.

623
01:06:00.737 --> 01:06:02.898
Company ship, company crew.

624
01:06:03.974 --> 01:06:06.875
You agreed.
The Black Pearl was to be mine.

625
01:06:07.777 --> 01:06:09.176
And so it was.

626
01:06:12.248 --> 01:06:15.308
Perhaps you'll consider
an alternative arrangement.

627
01:06:15.385 --> 01:06:20.618
One which requires absolutely
nothing from you but information.

628
01:06:27.063 --> 01:06:31.762
Regarding the Brethren Court, no doubt.
In exchange for fair compensation?

629
01:06:32.836 --> 01:06:34.895
Square my debt with Jones...

630
01:06:35.939 --> 01:06:37.804
...guarantee my freedom?

631
01:06:37.874 --> 01:06:39.501
Of course.

632
01:06:39.576 --> 01:06:41.510
It's just good business.

633
01:06:42.579 --> 01:06:47.380
Were I in a divulgatory mood,
what then might I divulge?

634
01:06:47.450 --> 01:06:49.645
Everything.

635
01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:51.417
Where are they meeting?

636
01:06:52.222 --> 01:06:54.213
Who are the pirate lords?

637
01:06:55.191 --> 01:06:58.388
What is the purpose
of the nine pieces of eight?

638
01:06:59.029 --> 01:07:02.157
Prepare the brig.

639
01:07:04.834 --> 01:07:09.737
Beckett agreed the Black Pearl
was to be mine.

640
01:07:09.806 --> 01:07:13.469
He's not going to give up the only ship
as can outrun the Dutchman, is he?

641
01:07:20.617 --> 01:07:24.986
Shame they're not bound to honor
the code of the Brethren, isn't it?

642
01:07:25.055 --> 01:07:28.286
Because honor's
a hard thing to come by nowadays.

643
01:07:28.958 --> 01:07:32.155
There is no honor
to remaining with the losing side.

644
01:07:32.228 --> 01:07:36.756
Leaving it for the winning side,
that's just good business.

645
01:07:36.833 --> 01:07:40.701
- The losing side, you say?
- They have the Dutchman.

646
01:07:40.770 --> 01:07:42.260
Now the Pearl!

647
01:07:43.273 --> 01:07:45.207
And what do the Brethren have?

648
01:07:45.909 --> 01:07:48.969
We have Calypso.

649
01:07:56.753 --> 01:07:59.119
Calypso.

650
01:08:01.191 --> 01:08:03.182
An old legend.

651
01:08:04.327 --> 01:08:09.264
No. The goddess herself,
bound in human form.

652
01:08:09.699 --> 01:08:14.966
Imagine all the power of the seas
brought to bear against our enemy.

653
01:08:15.038 --> 01:08:20.340
I intend to release her.
But for that I need the Brethren Court.

654
01:08:22.712 --> 01:08:24.304
All the Court.

655
01:08:26.182 --> 01:08:27.877
You can keep Barbossa.

656
01:08:27.951 --> 01:08:32.012
The belligerent homunculus and
his friend with the wooden eye, both.

657
01:08:32.088 --> 01:08:34.613
And Turner. Especially Turner.

658
01:08:34.691 --> 01:08:38.149
The rest go with me on the Pearl.
I'll lead you to Shipwreck Cove,

659
01:08:38.228 --> 01:08:42.562
where I will hand you the pirates
and you will not hand me to Jones.

660
01:08:42.632 --> 01:08:47.160
- Bloody fair deal, don't you think?
- And what becomes of Miss Swann?

661
01:08:49.906 --> 01:08:52.033
What interest is she to you?

662
01:08:54.577 --> 01:08:56.943
What are you proposing, captain?

663
01:08:57.013 --> 01:09:00.005
What be accepting, cap'n?

664
01:09:01.484 --> 01:09:03.850
- The girl.
- What?

665
01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:05.478
Jack.

666
01:09:06.156 --> 01:09:07.953
I've just recalled.

667
01:09:08.024 --> 01:09:13.018
I've got this wonderful compass,
which points to whatever I want.

668
01:09:13.563 --> 01:09:15.827
So for what do I need you?

669
01:09:15.899 --> 01:09:17.924
Elizabeth is not part of any bargain.

670
01:09:18.735 --> 01:09:20.066
Out of the question.

671
01:09:20.136 --> 01:09:21.933
It was not a question.

672
01:09:22.005 --> 01:09:23.768
Points to the thing you want most.

673
01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:26.035
And that is not
the Brethren Court, is it?

674
01:09:26.109 --> 01:09:29.340
- Then what is, Jack?
- Me.

675
01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:32.441
- Dead.
- Done.

676
01:09:32.515 --> 01:09:35.177
What? Not done.

677
01:09:35.251 --> 01:09:37.811
You got us into this.
If it frees us, then done!

678
01:09:37.887 --> 01:09:38.979
Damn.

679
01:09:43.193 --> 01:09:46.959
Although, if I kill you,
then I can use the compass

680
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:51.524
to find Shipwreck Cove,
is it, on my own.

681
01:09:51.868 --> 01:09:54.234
Cut out the middle man, as it were.

682
01:09:54.304 --> 01:09:56.033
Elizabeth, they are pirates.

683
01:09:56.105 --> 01:09:59.597
I have had more than enough
experience dealing with pirates!

684
01:10:00.210 --> 01:10:02.576
Then we have an accord?

685
01:10:04.447 --> 01:10:07.007
With me killed,
you'd arrive at the cove,

686
01:10:07.083 --> 01:10:10.280
find it a stronghold,
nigh impregnable...

687
01:10:10.353 --> 01:10:13.288
...able to withstand blockade for years.

688
01:10:13.356 --> 01:10:17.918
Then you'd be wishing, "lf only there
was someone I had not killed inside

689
01:10:18.061 --> 01:10:21.497
to ensure that the pirates
then come outside."

690
01:10:22.365 --> 01:10:24.265
And you can accomplish all this?

691
01:10:25.568 --> 01:10:28.628
You may kill me,
but you may never insult me.

692
01:10:28.972 --> 01:10:30.030
Who am I?

693
01:10:32.342 --> 01:10:34.037
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

694
01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:39.040
Done!

695
01:11:12.315 --> 01:11:13.475
Man overboard!

696
01:11:27.563 --> 01:11:28.757
You're mad.

697
01:11:29.065 --> 01:11:32.296
Thank goodness.
If I wasn't, this'd probably never work.

698
01:11:49.986 --> 01:11:53.149
And that was without
even a single drop of rum.

699
01:12:00.663 --> 01:12:05.430
Send this pestilent, traitorous,
cowhearted, yeasty codpiece to the brig.

700
01:12:07.670 --> 01:12:09.331
Which ship do we follow?

701
01:12:09.405 --> 01:12:14.069
Signal the Dutchman to track down
Sao Feng. We follow the Pearl.

702
01:12:15.044 --> 01:12:17.569
How soon can we have
the ship ready to pursue?

703
01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:21.747
She's going down!

704
01:12:21.818 --> 01:12:23.342
Stand clear!

705
01:12:27.457 --> 01:12:32.360
Do you think he plans it all out,
or just makes it up as he goes along?

706
01:12:34.230 --> 01:12:35.219
Sir.

707
01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:23.636
By this time tomorrow, we will arrive
at Shipwreck Cove and you will be free.

708
01:13:26.182 --> 01:13:27.581
Calypso.

709
01:13:28.684 --> 01:13:30.151
Excuse me?

710
01:13:31.187 --> 01:13:35.283
Not a name you fancy, I imagine,
out of the many that you have...

711
01:13:35.858 --> 01:13:37.485
...but it is what we call you.

712
01:13:39.395 --> 01:13:40.589
We being who?

713
01:13:45.334 --> 01:13:47.131
You confirm it.

714
01:13:48.504 --> 01:13:49.903
Confirm what?

715
01:13:51.174 --> 01:13:55.770
- You've told me nothing.
- The Brethren Court, not I.

716
01:13:55.845 --> 01:14:00.441
The First Brethren Court,
whose decision I would have opposed.

717
01:14:01.551 --> 01:14:03.451
They bound you to human form

718
01:14:03.519 --> 01:14:06.977
so the rule of the seas
would belong to man and not...

719
01:14:07.056 --> 01:14:08.819
To me.

720
01:14:11.394 --> 01:14:16.263
But one such as you should never
be anything less than what you are.

721
01:14:16.332 --> 01:14:18.926
Pretty speech from a captor.

722
01:14:19.001 --> 01:14:22.994
But words whispered
through prison bars lose their charm.

723
01:14:23.339 --> 01:14:26.331
Can I be blamed for my efforts?

724
01:14:28.311 --> 01:14:32.577
All men are drawn to the sea,
perilous though it may be.

725
01:14:32.648 --> 01:14:36.448
And some men offer desire
as justification for their crimes.

726
01:14:37.487 --> 01:14:40.012
I offer simply my desire.

727
01:14:41.491 --> 01:14:42.981
And in return?

728
01:14:44.093 --> 01:14:48.029
I would have your gifts,
should you choose to give them.

729
01:14:52.101 --> 01:14:56.094
And if I should choose not?

730
01:14:57.607 --> 01:14:59.575
Then I will take...

731
01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:01.934
...your fury.

732
01:15:27.737 --> 01:15:29.034
Sao Feng?

733
01:15:30.606 --> 01:15:31.732
Here.

734
01:15:32.141 --> 01:15:33.608
Please.

735
01:15:39.482 --> 01:15:43.009
With all nine pieces of eight...

736
01:15:45.488 --> 01:15:47.547
...you will be free.

737
01:15:49.392 --> 01:15:50.518
Take it!

738
01:15:52.361 --> 01:15:54.192
You are captain now.

739
01:15:55.364 --> 01:15:56.388
Me?

740
01:15:59.035 --> 01:16:03.631
Go in my place to Shipwreck Cove.

741
01:16:05.708 --> 01:16:08.302
Captain! The ship is taken.
We cannot...

742
01:16:09.745 --> 01:16:13.306
Forgive me... Calypso.

743
01:16:22.558 --> 01:16:23.650
Sao.

744
01:16:28.764 --> 01:16:30.459
What did he tell you?

745
01:16:35.538 --> 01:16:37.403
He made me captain.

746
01:16:39.675 --> 01:16:41.905
Set! Fire!

747
01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:49.375
You are not my captain.

748
01:16:49.652 --> 01:16:50.983
Elizabeth.

749
01:16:51.854 --> 01:16:53.412
James. James.

750
01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.128
Thank God, you're alive.

751
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:02.388
Your father'll be overjoyed

752
01:17:02.465 --> 01:17:05.298
- to know you're safe.
- My father's dead.

753
01:17:05.768 --> 01:17:08.498
No, that can't be true.
He returned to England.

754
01:17:09.505 --> 01:17:11.439
Did Lord Beckett tell you that?

755
01:17:12.742 --> 01:17:15.506
Who among you
do you name as captain?

756
01:17:15.578 --> 01:17:17.068
Captain. Her.

757
01:17:17.146 --> 01:17:18.807
Her.

758
01:17:21.684 --> 01:17:22.776
Captain?

759
01:17:22.852 --> 01:17:26.515
Tow the ship.
Put the prisoners in the brig.

760
01:17:27.823 --> 01:17:29.791
The captain shall have my quarters.

761
01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:32.827
Thank you, sir.

762
01:17:32.895 --> 01:17:36.626
- But I prefer to remain with my crew.
- Elizabeth.

763
01:17:36.699 --> 01:17:38.189
I swear.

764
01:17:39.135 --> 01:17:40.193
I did not know.

765
01:17:40.269 --> 01:17:44.399
Know what?
Which side you chose?

766
01:17:52.415 --> 01:17:54.178
Well, now you do.

767
01:18:02.858 --> 01:18:03.847
Bootstrap?

768
01:18:12.468 --> 01:18:13.765
Bootstrap.

769
01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:15.498
Bill Turner?

770
01:18:16.639 --> 01:18:17.765
Bootstrap.

771
01:18:26.949 --> 01:18:28.849
You know my name.

772
01:18:32.354 --> 01:18:33.719
Yes, I know your son.

773
01:18:35.791 --> 01:18:37.315
Will Turner.

774
01:18:38.761 --> 01:18:39.853
William.

775
01:18:45.735 --> 01:18:48.226
He made it. He's alive.

776
01:18:48.304 --> 01:18:52.536
And now he sends you to tell me
that he's coming to get me.

777
01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:56.876
God's wounds. He's on his way.

778
01:18:56.946 --> 01:18:58.311
Yes, Will is alive.

779
01:18:59.749 --> 01:19:01.307
And he wants to help you.

780
01:19:06.789 --> 01:19:10.418
He can't help me. He won't come.

781
01:19:11.193 --> 01:19:12.751
But you're his father.

782
01:19:13.596 --> 01:19:15.359
I know you.

783
01:19:16.198 --> 01:19:17.756
He spoke of you.

784
01:19:19.735 --> 01:19:22.898
He can't save me.
He can't come because of you.

785
01:19:24.273 --> 01:19:25.297
Me?

786
01:19:26.842 --> 01:19:28.571
You're Elizabeth.

787
01:19:29.945 --> 01:19:31.412
Yes, I'm Elizabeth.

788
01:19:33.215 --> 01:19:38.175
If Jones be slain,
he who slays him must take his place.

789
01:19:38.754 --> 01:19:41.621
Captain... Forever.

790
01:19:44.493 --> 01:19:47.462
The Dutchman
must always have a captain.

791
01:19:48.164 --> 01:19:50.257
And if he saves me...

792
01:19:51.467 --> 01:19:53.332
...he loses you.

793
01:19:56.305 --> 01:19:57.397
I see.

794
01:19:59.375 --> 01:20:01.240
He won't pick me.

795
01:20:02.178 --> 01:20:04.339
I wouldn't pick me.

796
01:20:09.418 --> 01:20:10.942
Tell him not to come.

797
01:20:13.155 --> 01:20:15.282
Tell him to stay away.

798
01:20:16.592 --> 01:20:18.617
Tell him it's too late.

799
01:20:20.196 --> 01:20:22.460
I'm already a part of the ship...

800
01:20:24.533 --> 01:20:26.160
...and the crew.

801
01:20:28.337 --> 01:20:29.326
Bootstrap.

802
01:20:32.408 --> 01:20:34.308
You know my name.

803
01:20:35.211 --> 01:20:37.304
You know my name.

804
01:20:38.547 --> 01:20:40.378
Yes, I know your son.

805
01:20:41.383 --> 01:20:43.078
William.

806
01:20:45.688 --> 01:20:47.656
He's coming for me.

807
01:20:48.357 --> 01:20:49.847
Wait and see.

808
01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:52.291
You'll see.

809
01:20:53.696 --> 01:20:55.459
He promised.

810
01:21:11.881 --> 01:21:13.815
Swing her over.

811
01:21:15.017 --> 01:21:16.780
Ready those lines.

812
01:21:28.530 --> 01:21:29.690
Sir.

813
01:21:33.068 --> 01:21:34.933
A breadcrumb trail.

814
01:21:35.004 --> 01:21:39.338
- And we're meant to follow.
- A betrayer among them?

815
01:21:39.408 --> 01:21:44.573
- Or a trap?
- A gambit by a skilled opponent.

816
01:21:45.881 --> 01:21:49.874
- Adjust course, lieutenant.
- Sir?

817
01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:53.984
We can only hope
to reach our destination

818
01:21:54.056 --> 01:21:56.081
before they run out of bodies.

819
01:22:09.738 --> 01:22:12.798
You escaped the brig
even quicker than I expected.

820
01:22:13.742 --> 01:22:17.143
William, do you notice anything?

821
01:22:18.814 --> 01:22:20.042
Rather...

822
01:22:20.449 --> 01:22:23.976
...do you notice something
that is not there to be noticed?

823
01:22:24.753 --> 01:22:27.745
- You haven't raised an alarm.
- Odd, isn't it?

824
01:22:27.823 --> 01:22:29.290
Not as odd as this.

825
01:22:30.693 --> 01:22:33.161
Come up with this
all by your lonesome, did you?

826
01:22:33.228 --> 01:22:36.254
I said to myself, "Think like Jack."

827
01:22:36.632 --> 01:22:38.827
This is what you've arrived at?

828
01:22:38.901 --> 01:22:42.234
Lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove
so as to gain his trust...

829
01:22:42.304 --> 01:22:44.135
...accomplish your own ends?

830
01:22:44.206 --> 01:22:46.003
It's like you don't know me at all.

831
01:22:49.311 --> 01:22:52.405
And how does your dearly beloved
feel about this plan?

832
01:22:53.782 --> 01:22:55.113
Ah.

833
01:22:55.718 --> 01:22:58.243
You've not seen fit
to trust her with it.

834
01:23:01.623 --> 01:23:03.181
I'm losing her, Jack.

835
01:23:03.926 --> 01:23:07.862
Every step I make for my father
is a step away from Elizabeth.

836
01:23:08.330 --> 01:23:12.027
If you choose to lock your heart away,
you'll lose her for certain.

837
01:23:12.568 --> 01:23:15.765
If I might lend a machete
to your intellectual thicket...

838
01:23:16.939 --> 01:23:18.907
...avoid the choice altogether.

839
01:23:19.742 --> 01:23:21.209
Change the facts.

840
01:23:22.277 --> 01:23:25.269
Let someone else dispatch Jones.

841
01:23:26.048 --> 01:23:27.379
Who?

842
01:23:31.653 --> 01:23:32.642
You?

843
01:23:34.990 --> 01:23:38.391
Death has a curious way
of reshuffling one's priorities.

844
01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:41.987
I slip aboard the Dutchman,
find the heart, stab the beating thing,

845
01:23:42.064 --> 01:23:43.827
your father's free from his debt,

846
01:23:43.899 --> 01:23:46.629
you're free to be
with your charming murderess.

847
01:23:46.702 --> 01:23:50.536
You're willing to cut out your heart
and bind yourself to the Dutchman...

848
01:23:50.606 --> 01:23:54.565
...forever?
- No, mate. I'm free forever.

849
01:23:54.643 --> 01:23:58.670
Free to sail the seas beyond the edges
of the map. Free from death itself.

850
01:23:59.014 --> 01:24:01.073
You have to do the job though, Jack.

851
01:24:01.150 --> 01:24:04.210
You have to ferry souls
to the next world.

852
01:24:04.853 --> 01:24:07.447
Or end up just like Jones.

853
01:24:09.525 --> 01:24:11.516
I don't have the face for tentacles.

854
01:24:13.362 --> 01:24:15.922
But immortal has to
count for something, eh?

855
01:24:19.935 --> 01:24:21.095
What's this for?

856
01:24:21.170 --> 01:24:23.866
Think like me. It'll come to you.

857
01:24:37.119 --> 01:24:39.519
My regards to Davy Jones.

858
01:24:44.793 --> 01:24:46.260
I hate him.

859
01:24:50.833 --> 01:24:51.959
Come with me.

860
01:24:55.537 --> 01:24:56.765
Quickly.

861
01:25:05.814 --> 01:25:07.076
What are you doing?

862
01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:10.775
Choosing a side.

863
01:25:35.310 --> 01:25:39.269
Do not go to Shipwreck Cove. Beckett
knows of the meeting of the Brethren.

864
01:25:39.348 --> 01:25:41.680
I fear there may be
a traitor among them.

865
01:25:43.018 --> 01:25:45.145
It's too late to earn my forgiveness.

866
01:25:46.388 --> 01:25:49.186
I had nothing to do
with your father's death.

867
01:25:51.393 --> 01:25:54.385
But that does not absolve me
of my other sins.

868
01:25:57.933 --> 01:25:58.991
Come with us.

869
01:26:03.071 --> 01:26:04.766
James, come with me.

870
01:26:05.974 --> 01:26:07.874
Who goes there?

871
01:26:10.646 --> 01:26:12.580
Go. I will follow.

872
01:26:14.183 --> 01:26:15.844
You're lying.

873
01:26:18.587 --> 01:26:21.488
Our destinies have been entwined,
Elizabeth...

874
01:26:23.859 --> 01:26:25.383
...but never joined.

875
01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:33.595
Go, now.

876
01:26:39.575 --> 01:26:41.736
Back to your station, sailor.

877
01:26:43.579 --> 01:26:48.846
- No one leaves the ship.
- Stand down. That's an order.

878
01:26:48.917 --> 01:26:50.612
That's an order.

879
01:26:51.687 --> 01:26:54.349
Part of the crew, part of the ship.

880
01:26:54.423 --> 01:26:57.187
Part of the crew,
part of the ship. Part of the crew...

881
01:26:57.259 --> 01:27:00.160
- Steady, man.
- Part of the crew, part of the ship.

882
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:02.629
All hands, prisoner escape!

883
01:27:02.965 --> 01:27:05.195
- Belay that!
- James!

884
01:27:16.945 --> 01:27:19.038
Prisoner escape!

885
01:27:21.483 --> 01:27:23.144
James! No!

886
01:27:32.227 --> 01:27:35.025
- The admiral's dead.
- Admiral's dead?

887
01:27:35.097 --> 01:27:37.122
- The admiral's dead.
- Admiral's dead.

888
01:27:40.335 --> 01:27:42.895
To the captain's cabin!

889
01:27:42.971 --> 01:27:44.962
Back to the ship.

890
01:27:46.942 --> 01:27:50.878
James Norrington. Do you fear death?

891
01:28:00.222 --> 01:28:02.281
I take that as a "no."

892
01:28:06.795 --> 01:28:08.319
Nice sword.

893
01:28:29.284 --> 01:28:34.312
The Dutchman is under my command.

894
01:28:36.825 --> 01:28:39.123
For now.

895
01:28:54.901 --> 01:28:56.960
Look alive and keep a weather eye.

896
01:28:57.037 --> 01:28:59.437
Not for naught
it's called Shipwreck Island.

897
01:28:59.506 --> 01:29:02.942
Where lies Shipwreck Cove
and the town of Shipwreck.

898
01:29:03.009 --> 01:29:05.443
You heard him. Step lively.

899
01:29:05.512 --> 01:29:07.844
For all that pirates are clever clogs,

900
01:29:07.914 --> 01:29:10.747
we are unimaginative
when it comes to naming things.

901
01:29:10.817 --> 01:29:12.045
Aye.

902
01:29:12.119 --> 01:29:16.249
I once sailed with a geezer who lost
both of his arms and part of his eye.

903
01:29:16.323 --> 01:29:17.915
What'd you call him?

904
01:29:19.092 --> 01:29:20.320
Larry.

905
01:29:24.030 --> 01:29:26.999
I do not renege
on a bargain once struck.

906
01:29:27.067 --> 01:29:29.058
But we agreed on ends only.

907
01:29:29.136 --> 01:29:32.105
The means are mine to decide.

908
01:29:32.172 --> 01:29:34.663
Caution, Barbossa.

909
01:29:34.741 --> 01:29:38.973
Do not forget it was by my power
you return from the dead.

910
01:29:39.045 --> 01:29:42.879
Or what it mean if you fail me.

911
01:29:46.153 --> 01:29:49.020
Don't you forget
why you had to bring me back.

912
01:29:49.089 --> 01:29:52.820
Why I could not leave Jack
to his well-deserved fate.

913
01:29:53.727 --> 01:29:56.252
It took nine pirate lords
to bind you, Calypso.

914
01:29:56.797 --> 01:30:00.096
And it'll take no less than nine
to set you free.

915
01:30:00.167 --> 01:30:02.362
Masters Pintel and Ragetti.

916
01:30:04.204 --> 01:30:07.298
Take this fishwife to the brig.

917
01:30:09.142 --> 01:30:11.269
Right this way, Mrs. Fish.

918
01:30:39.105 --> 01:30:43.098
I cannot be summoned
like some mongrel pup.

919
01:30:43.176 --> 01:30:45.110
Apparently, you can.

920
01:30:45.645 --> 01:30:47.306
I believe you know each other.

921
01:30:52.173 --> 01:30:56.303
Come to join my crew again,
Master Turner?

922
01:30:56.377 --> 01:30:57.742
Not yours.

923
01:30:58.179 --> 01:30:59.373
His.

924
01:31:00.281 --> 01:31:02.408
Jack Sparrow sends his regards.

925
01:31:03.518 --> 01:31:05.349
Sparrow?

926
01:31:06.788 --> 01:31:08.380
You didn't tell him.

927
01:31:08.456 --> 01:31:11.687
We rescued Jack from the Locker
along with the Black Pearl.

928
01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:15.361
What else have you not told me?

929
01:31:16.131 --> 01:31:20.124
There is an issue far more troublesome.

930
01:31:21.469 --> 01:31:25.064
I believe you're familiar
with a person called Calypso.

931
01:31:27.709 --> 01:31:29.404
Not a person.

932
01:31:30.145 --> 01:31:31.203
A heathen god.

933
01:31:31.279 --> 01:31:34.806
One who delights in cursing men
with their wildest dreams

934
01:31:34.883 --> 01:31:38.216
and then revealing them to be
hollow and naught but ash.

935
01:31:38.286 --> 01:31:41.414
- The world is well rid of her.
- Not quite so well, actually.

936
01:31:42.323 --> 01:31:44.917
The Brethren Court
intends to release her.

937
01:31:45.727 --> 01:31:47.524
No! They cannot!

938
01:31:47.595 --> 01:31:50.564
The First Court
promised to imprison her forever.

939
01:31:50.632 --> 01:31:53.601
- That was our agreement.
- Your agreement?

940
01:31:56.137 --> 01:32:00.130
I showed them how to bind her.

941
01:32:00.208 --> 01:32:02.176
She could not be trusted.

942
01:32:02.243 --> 01:32:04.074
I... She gave me no choice.

943
01:32:04.646 --> 01:32:07.581
We must act before they release her.

944
01:32:07.649 --> 01:32:09.412
You loved her.

945
01:32:10.652 --> 01:32:12.620
She's the one.

946
01:32:12.687 --> 01:32:14.678
And then you betrayed her.

947
01:32:14.756 --> 01:32:18.556
She pretended to love me.

948
01:32:18.626 --> 01:32:22.392
She betrayed me.

949
01:32:25.233 --> 01:32:28.760
And after which betrayal
did you cut out your heart, I wonder.

950
01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:34.736
Do not test me.

951
01:32:34.809 --> 01:32:36.538
I hadn't finished that.

952
01:32:38.546 --> 01:32:40.673
You will free my father.

953
01:32:41.382 --> 01:32:43.850
And you will guarantee
Elizabeth's safety.

954
01:32:43.918 --> 01:32:45.510
Along with my own.

955
01:32:45.587 --> 01:32:48.147
Your terms are steep, Mr. Turner.

956
01:32:48.223 --> 01:32:50.987
We will expect fair value in return.

957
01:32:51.426 --> 01:32:55.362
There is only one price I will accept:

958
01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:58.490
Calypso murdered.

959
01:33:00.401 --> 01:33:02.733
Calypso's aboard the Black Pearl.

960
01:33:04.806 --> 01:33:08.173
Jack has sailed
the Black Pearl to Shipwreck Cove.

961
01:33:09.210 --> 01:33:14.443
And with you no longer aboard her,
how do you propose to lead us there?

962
01:33:26.294 --> 01:33:28.854
What is it you want most?

963
01:34:00.795 --> 01:34:02.353
Look at them all.

964
01:34:02.430 --> 01:34:06.526
There's not been a gathering
like this in our lifetime.

965
01:34:07.335 --> 01:34:09.326
And I owe them all money.

966
01:34:14.742 --> 01:34:17.210
As he who issued summons,

967
01:34:17.278 --> 01:34:21.840
I convene this,
the Fourth Brethren Court.

968
01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:29.378
To confirm your lordship
and right to be heard,

969
01:34:29.490 --> 01:34:34.223
present now your pieces of eight,
my fellow cap'ns.

970
01:34:42.370 --> 01:34:45.567
Those aren't pieces of eight.
They're just pieces of junk.

971
01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:49.371
Aye. The original plan was to use
nine pieces of eight to bind Calypso.

972
01:34:49.444 --> 01:34:53.778
But when the First Court met,
the Brethren were to a one skint broke.

973
01:34:54.482 --> 01:34:55.540
So change the name.

974
01:34:56.751 --> 01:35:00.949
To "nine pieces of whatever we happened
to have in our pockets at the time?"

975
01:35:01.022 --> 01:35:03.354
Oh, yes. That sounds very piratey.

976
01:35:06.995 --> 01:35:09.486
Master Ragetti, if you will.

977
01:35:10.298 --> 01:35:13.290
I kept it safe, just like
you said when you gave it to me.

978
01:35:13.368 --> 01:35:16.462
Aye, you have.
But now I need it back.

979
01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:20.432
Sparrow.

980
01:35:26.547 --> 01:35:30.176
Might I point out that
we are still short one pirate lord,

981
01:35:30.251 --> 01:35:34.210
and I'm as content as a cucumber
to wait until Sao Feng joins us.

982
01:35:34.288 --> 01:35:35.880
Sao Feng is dead.

983
01:35:38.026 --> 01:35:40.119
He fell to the Flying Dutchman.

984
01:35:40.361 --> 01:35:41.487
The plagued ship.

985
01:35:42.730 --> 01:35:46.131
He made you captain? They're
giving the bloody title away now.

986
01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:49.169
- £¡Que lo manden al diablo!
- Listen. Listen to me.

987
01:35:49.237 --> 01:35:51.467
Our location has been betrayed.

988
01:35:51.539 --> 01:35:55.168
Jones is under the command of
Lord Beckett. They're on their way here.

989
01:35:55.243 --> 01:35:58.940
- Who is this betrayer?
- Not likely anyone among us.

990
01:35:59.313 --> 01:36:01.338
- Where's Will?
- Not among us.

991
01:36:01.416 --> 01:36:04.146
It matters not how they found us.
The question is,

992
01:36:04.218 --> 01:36:06.709
what will we do now that they have?

993
01:36:06.788 --> 01:36:08.278
We fight.

994
01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:15.796
Shipwreck Cove is a fortress.

995
01:36:15.863 --> 01:36:18.661
A well-supplied fortress.

996
01:36:19.267 --> 01:36:23.067
There is no need to fight
if they cannot get to us.

997
01:36:23.838 --> 01:36:27.205
There be a third course.

998
01:36:28.443 --> 01:36:30.877
In another age, at this very spot,

999
01:36:30.945 --> 01:36:36.440
the First Brethren Court captured the
sea goddess and bound her in her bones.

1000
01:36:39.187 --> 01:36:40.620
That was a mistake.

1001
01:36:41.622 --> 01:36:44.386
Oh, we tamed the seas
for ourselves, aye.

1002
01:36:45.359 --> 01:36:48.453
But opened the door
to Beckett and his ilk.

1003
01:36:50.465 --> 01:36:52.899
Better were the days
when mastery of seas

1004
01:36:52.967 --> 01:36:56.801
came not from bargains
struck with eldritch creatures,

1005
01:36:56.871 --> 01:37:01.240
but from the sweat of a mars brow
and the strength of his back alone.

1006
01:37:01.309 --> 01:37:03.140
You all know this to be true.

1007
01:37:03.978 --> 01:37:05.343
Gentlemen.

1008
01:37:06.447 --> 01:37:07.607
Ladies.

1009
01:37:12.253 --> 01:37:15.245
We must free Calypso.

1010
01:37:24.265 --> 01:37:26.699
- Shoot him.
- Cut out his tongue!

1011
01:37:26.767 --> 01:37:30.669
Shoot him, cut out his tongue, then
shoot his tongue. And trim that beard.

1012
01:37:30.738 --> 01:37:33.263
Sao Feng would've agreed with Barbossa.

1013
01:37:33.341 --> 01:37:36.242
Calypso was our enemy then,
she will be our enemy now.

1014
01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:38.244
It's unlikely her mood's improved.

1015
01:37:38.312 --> 01:37:42.146
I would still agree with Sao Feng.
We release Calypso.

1016
01:37:42.216 --> 01:37:45.151
- You threaten me?
- I silence you.

1017
01:37:57.398 --> 01:38:00.561
- This is madness.
- This is politics.

1018
01:38:00.635 --> 01:38:03.229
Meanwhile, our enemies
are bearing down upon us.

1019
01:38:03.304 --> 01:38:05.829
If they not be here already.

1020
01:38:42.043 --> 01:38:44.409
My sweet.

1021
01:38:44.712 --> 01:38:46.839
You come for me.

1022
01:38:47.815 --> 01:38:52.775
- You were expecting me.
- It has been torture.

1023
01:38:52.853 --> 01:38:57.085
Trapped in this single form.

1024
01:38:57.625 --> 01:38:59.991
Cut off from the sea.

1025
01:39:00.461 --> 01:39:03.055
From all that I love.

1026
01:39:04.332 --> 01:39:05.731
From you.

1027
01:39:06.434 --> 01:39:10.962
Ten years I devoted
to the duty you charged to me.

1028
01:39:12.340 --> 01:39:17.744
Ten years I looked after
those who died at sea.

1029
01:39:18.412 --> 01:39:22.974
And, finally,
when we could be together again...

1030
01:39:24.752 --> 01:39:28.552
...you weren't there.

1031
01:39:28.956 --> 01:39:31.550
Why weren't you there?

1032
01:39:34.962 --> 01:39:36.589
It's my nature.

1033
01:39:37.798 --> 01:39:42.394
Would you love me
if I was anything but what I am?

1034
01:39:43.571 --> 01:39:47.371
I do not love you.

1035
01:39:49.877 --> 01:39:53.574
Many things you were, Davy Jones.

1036
01:39:54.649 --> 01:39:56.776
But never cruel.

1037
01:39:57.618 --> 01:40:00.587
You have corrupted your purpose...

1038
01:40:01.956 --> 01:40:04.550
...and so your self.

1039
01:40:05.626 --> 01:40:10.495
And you did hide away
what should always have been mine.

1040
01:40:30.384 --> 01:40:33.444
Calypso.

1041
01:40:36.490 --> 01:40:38.355
I will be free.

1042
01:40:40.294 --> 01:40:43.991
And when I am,
I would give you my heart.

1043
01:40:44.765 --> 01:40:47.757
And we would be together always.

1044
01:40:48.402 --> 01:40:51.769
If only you had a heart to give.

1045
01:40:56.544 --> 01:40:58.603
Why did you come?

1046
01:41:15.896 --> 01:41:21.061
And what fate have you planned
for your captors?

1047
01:41:21.469 --> 01:41:23.460
The Brethren Court?

1048
01:41:25.439 --> 01:41:30.240
All of them, the last thing
they will learn in this life...

1049
01:41:30.311 --> 01:41:33.007
...is how cruel I can be.

1050
01:41:37.585 --> 01:41:42.045
And what of your fate, Davy Jones?

1051
01:41:43.524 --> 01:41:47.016
My heart will always belong to you.

1052
01:42:00.408 --> 01:42:04.208
It was the First Court
what imprisoned Calypso.

1053
01:42:04.278 --> 01:42:06.576
We should be the ones to set her free.

1054
01:42:06.647 --> 01:42:10.981
And in her gratitude,
she will see fit to grant us boons.

1055
01:42:11.051 --> 01:42:13.519
Whose boons? Your boons?

1056
01:42:13.587 --> 01:42:16.579
Utterly deceptive twaddle-speak, says I.

1057
01:42:16.657 --> 01:42:21.060
If you have a better alternative,
please, share.

1058
01:42:22.329 --> 01:42:23.353
Cuttlefish.

1059
01:42:24.565 --> 01:42:26.624
Aye.

1060
01:42:27.601 --> 01:42:30.229
Let us not, dear friends,

1061
01:42:30.304 --> 01:42:33.296
forget our dear friends, the cuttlefish.

1062
01:42:33.841 --> 01:42:36.036
Flipping glorious little sausages.

1063
01:42:36.110 --> 01:42:40.069
Pen them up together, they'll devour
each other without a second thought.

1064
01:42:40.147 --> 01:42:41.409
Human nature, isn't it?

1065
01:42:41.482 --> 01:42:43.507
Or... Or fish nature.

1066
01:42:43.584 --> 01:42:47.315
So, yes, we could hole up here
well-provisioned and well-armed.

1067
01:42:47.388 --> 01:42:49.549
Half of us would be dead
within the month.

1068
01:42:49.623 --> 01:42:53.559
Which seems quite grim to me,
any way you slice it. Or...

1069
01:42:55.429 --> 01:42:56.760
Uh...

1070
01:42:58.499 --> 01:43:04.267
As my learned colleague
so naively suggests,

1071
01:43:04.338 --> 01:43:08.331
we can release Calypso, and we
can pray that she will be merciful.

1072
01:43:09.844 --> 01:43:11.106
I rather doubt it.

1073
01:43:11.912 --> 01:43:15.905
Can we pretend she's anything
other than a woman scorned

1074
01:43:15.983 --> 01:43:18.850
like which fury hell hath no? We cannot.

1075
01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:23.285
Res ipsa loquitur, tabula in naufragio.

1076
01:43:23.357 --> 01:43:26.121
We are left with but one option.

1077
01:43:26.193 --> 01:43:30.061
I agree with, and I cannot believe
the words are coming out of me mouth...

1078
01:43:32.366 --> 01:43:35.301
...Captain Swann. We must fight.

1079
01:43:35.369 --> 01:43:38.600
- You've always run away from a fight.
- Have not.

1080
01:43:38.672 --> 01:43:39.730
- Have so.
- Have not.

1081
01:43:39.874 --> 01:43:40.932
- Have so.
- Have not!

1082
01:43:41.075 --> 01:43:44.238
- You have so, and you know it.
- Have not. Slander and calumny.

1083
01:43:44.311 --> 01:43:48.611
I have only ever embraced that
oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.

1084
01:43:48.682 --> 01:43:52.880
I submit that here now
that is what we all must do:

1085
01:43:52.953 --> 01:43:54.352
We must fight...

1086
01:43:55.122 --> 01:43:56.612
...to run away.

1087
01:43:56.690 --> 01:43:59.022
- Aye!
- Aye!

1088
01:44:00.794 --> 01:44:05.231
As per the code, an act of war,
and this be exactly that,

1089
01:44:05.299 --> 01:44:08.200
can only be declared by the pirate king.

1090
01:44:08.269 --> 01:44:10.829
- You made that up.
- Did I, now?

1091
01:44:10.905 --> 01:44:15.433
I call on Cap'n Teague,
keeper of the code.

1092
01:44:16.443 --> 01:44:19.879
Sri Sumbhajee proclaims
this all to be folly!

1093
01:44:21.515 --> 01:44:24.006
Hang the code. Who cares a...?

1094
01:44:32.026 --> 01:44:33.857
Code is the law.

1095
01:44:45.873 --> 01:44:47.864
You're in my way, boy.

1096
01:44:57.084 --> 01:44:59.712
- The code.
- The code.

1097
01:44:59.787 --> 01:45:02.051
As set forth by Morgan and Bartholomew.

1098
01:45:20.074 --> 01:45:24.033
- That can't... How did...
- Sea turtles, mate.

1099
01:45:26.914 --> 01:45:28.404
Sea turtles.

1100
01:45:43.197 --> 01:45:45.893
Ah. Barbossa is right.

1101
01:45:45.966 --> 01:45:47.456
Hang on a minute.

1102
01:45:48.936 --> 01:45:50.904
"It shall be the duties, as the king,

1103
01:45:50.971 --> 01:45:54.429
to declare war,
parley with shared adversaries..."

1104
01:45:54.508 --> 01:45:55.497
Fancy that.

1105
01:45:55.576 --> 01:45:58.044
There has not been a king
since the First Court.

1106
01:45:58.112 --> 01:45:59.773
And that's not likely to change.

1107
01:45:59.847 --> 01:46:01.872
- Not likely.
- Why not?

1108
01:46:02.016 --> 01:46:04.644
See, the pirate king
is elected by popular vote.

1109
01:46:04.718 --> 01:46:08.210
And each pirate
only ever votes for hisself.

1110
01:46:08.288 --> 01:46:09.380
I call for a vote.

1111
01:46:14.194 --> 01:46:16.560
I vote for Ammand the corsair.

1112
01:46:16.630 --> 01:46:19.190
Capitaine Chevalle,
the penniless Frenchman.

1113
01:46:19.566 --> 01:46:22.228
Sri Sumbhajee
votes for Sri Sumbhajee.

1114
01:46:23.137 --> 01:46:25.071
Mistress Ching.

1115
01:46:25.139 --> 01:46:26.538
Gentleman Jocard.

1116
01:46:27.241 --> 01:46:29.801
- Elizabeth Swann.
- Barbossa.

1117
01:46:29.877 --> 01:46:31.640
Vallenueva!

1118
01:46:32.479 --> 01:46:33.810
Elizabeth Swann.

1119
01:46:34.848 --> 01:46:36.782
- What?
- I know. Curious, isn't it?

1120
01:46:39.319 --> 01:46:40.946
Vote for me. Vote for me.

1121
01:46:43.424 --> 01:46:44.823
What you talking about?

1122
01:46:44.892 --> 01:46:45.984
No!

1123
01:46:46.060 --> 01:46:49.689
Am I to understand that you lot
will not be keeping to the code, then?

1124
01:46:58.572 --> 01:46:59.766
Very well.

1125
01:47:03.143 --> 01:47:08.137
What say you, Captain Swann,
king of the Brethren Court?

1126
01:47:10.117 --> 01:47:12.449
Prepare every vessel that floats.

1127
01:47:13.287 --> 01:47:14.447
At dawn...

1128
01:47:16.023 --> 01:47:17.217
...we're at war.

1129
01:47:21.028 --> 01:47:24.623
And so we shall go to war.

1130
01:47:38.312 --> 01:47:39.301
What?

1131
01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:43.078
You've seen it all,
done it all. You survived.

1132
01:47:43.617 --> 01:47:46.450
That's the trick, isn't it?
To survive?

1133
01:47:47.020 --> 01:47:50.478
It's not just about
living forever, Jackie.

1134
01:47:54.428 --> 01:47:58.524
The trick is
living with yourself forever.

1135
01:48:02.569 --> 01:48:03.729
How's Mum?

1136
01:48:10.677 --> 01:48:12.201
She looks great.

1137
01:48:33.634 --> 01:48:37.229
The enemy is here! Let's take them!

1138
01:49:00.594 --> 01:49:03.085
Abandon ship. Abandon ship.

1139
01:49:12.039 --> 01:49:13.199
Parley?

1140
01:50:09.997 --> 01:50:13.626
You be the cur that led
these wolves to our door.

1141
01:50:13.700 --> 01:50:17.898
Don't blame Turner.
He was merely the tool of your betrayal.

1142
01:50:17.971 --> 01:50:22.499
If you wish to see its grand architect,
look to your left.

1143
01:50:25.913 --> 01:50:27.608
My hands are clean in this.

1144
01:50:28.649 --> 01:50:29.809
Figuratively.

1145
01:50:30.350 --> 01:50:32.818
My actions were my own
and to my own purpose.

1146
01:50:32.886 --> 01:50:36.322
- Jack had nothing to do with it.
- Well spoke. Listen to the tool.

1147
01:50:36.390 --> 01:50:38.358
Will, I've been aboard the Dutchman.

1148
01:50:39.293 --> 01:50:42.626
I understand the burden you bear,
but I fear that cause is lost.

1149
01:50:43.463 --> 01:50:47.331
No cause is lost if there is
but one fool left to fight for it.

1150
01:50:49.569 --> 01:50:54.472
If Turner wasn't acting on your behalf,
then how did he come to give me this?

1151
01:50:55.676 --> 01:51:00.636
You made a deal with me, Jack, to
deliver the pirates. And here they are.

1152
01:51:01.415 --> 01:51:04.782
Don't be bashful. Step up.
Claim your reward.

1153
01:51:04.851 --> 01:51:08.753
Your debt to me
is still to be satisfied.

1154
01:51:08.822 --> 01:51:13.782
One hundred years in servitude
aboard the Dutchman. As a start.

1155
01:51:14.461 --> 01:51:17.692
That debt was paid, mate.
With some help.

1156
01:51:17.764 --> 01:51:20.164
- You escaped.
- Technically.

1157
01:51:20.233 --> 01:51:22.292
I propose an exchange.

1158
01:51:24.371 --> 01:51:26.236
Will leaves with us...

1159
01:51:26.974 --> 01:51:28.737
...and you can take Jack.

1160
01:51:30.844 --> 01:51:31.833
Done.

1161
01:51:32.512 --> 01:51:34.207
- Undone.
- Done.

1162
01:51:34.281 --> 01:51:37.808
Jack's one of the nine pirate lords.
You have no right.

1163
01:51:37.884 --> 01:51:39.351
King.

1164
01:51:41.855 --> 01:51:45.916
- As you command, your nibs.
- Blackguard!

1165
01:51:51.131 --> 01:51:54.828
If ye have something to say,
I might be saying something as well.

1166
01:51:57.504 --> 01:51:59.529
First to the finish, then?

1167
01:52:20.827 --> 01:52:23.387
Do you fear death?

1168
01:52:24.931 --> 01:52:26.694
You've no idea.

1169
01:52:29.636 --> 01:52:31.501
Advise your Brethren,

1170
01:52:31.571 --> 01:52:34.665
you can fight, and all of you will die.

1171
01:52:34.741 --> 01:52:39.269
Or you can not fight,
in which case only most of you will die.

1172
01:52:39.846 --> 01:52:41.939
You murdered my father.

1173
01:52:43.316 --> 01:52:45.307
He chose his own fate.

1174
01:52:45.952 --> 01:52:48.682
And you have chosen yours.

1175
01:52:48.755 --> 01:52:50.814
We will fight.

1176
01:52:51.425 --> 01:52:53.222
And you will die.

1177
01:52:58.031 --> 01:52:59.658
So be it.

1178
01:53:05.672 --> 01:53:07.037
King?

1179
01:53:07.107 --> 01:53:09.940
Of the Brethren Court.
Courtesy of Jack.

1180
01:53:10.444 --> 01:53:12.776
Maybe he really
does know what he's doing.

1181
01:53:19.219 --> 01:53:20.208
Bravo!

1182
01:53:21.254 --> 01:53:25.452
You've successfully arrived aboard
the Dutchman as per the overall scheme.

1183
01:53:25.525 --> 01:53:27.254
- Look
- Oh, yes. Chapeau, mate.

1184
01:53:27.327 --> 01:53:30.387
Except for this sojourn in the brig,
it's utter clockwork.

1185
01:53:31.665 --> 01:53:32.825
Go away.

1186
01:53:32.899 --> 01:53:36.062
- What, back to the Locker?
- Not without you, Jackie.

1187
01:53:36.903 --> 01:53:37.995
Stab the heart.

1188
01:53:43.877 --> 01:53:49.008
Live forever as captain
of the Flying Dutchman.

1189
01:53:52.819 --> 01:53:54.411
Then again...

1190
01:53:55.255 --> 01:53:56.950
...if you're in the brig...

1191
01:53:58.458 --> 01:54:00.449
...who's to stab the heart?

1192
01:54:02.963 --> 01:54:05.830
Does seem to put immortality
a bit out of reach.

1193
01:54:07.567 --> 01:54:09.300
Peanut.

1194
01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:12.565
We'll need to use the Black Pearl
as a flagship to lead the attack.

1195
01:54:12.636 --> 01:54:16.800
- Oh, will we now?
- All right, Mrs. Fish. Come on.

1196
01:54:17.408 --> 01:54:20.844
Barbossa, you can't release her.

1197
01:54:20.911 --> 01:54:22.811
We need to give Jack a chance.

1198
01:54:23.414 --> 01:54:28.351
Apologies, Your Majesty. Too long
my fate has not been in me own hands.

1199
01:54:31.221 --> 01:54:32.518
No longer.

1200
01:54:34.525 --> 01:54:36.220
The enemy...

1201
01:54:37.394 --> 01:54:39.726
...has opted for oblivion.

1202
01:54:42.866 --> 01:54:44.493
Ready the fleet.

1203
01:54:44.735 --> 01:54:47.465
- To your stations.
- To your stations.

1204
01:54:53.944 --> 01:54:57.107
Be there some manner
of rite or incantation?

1205
01:54:57.181 --> 01:54:58.443
Aye.

1206
01:54:58.882 --> 01:55:02.147
The items brought together, done.

1207
01:55:02.219 --> 01:55:04.619
Items to be burned...

1208
01:55:05.289 --> 01:55:07.450
...and someone must speak the words:

1209
01:55:07.524 --> 01:55:11.016
"Calypso, I release you
from your human bonds."

1210
01:55:11.095 --> 01:55:12.084
Is that it?

1211
01:55:12.663 --> 01:55:16.724
'Tis said it must be spoken
as if to a lover.

1212
01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:18.495
Ooh!

1213
01:55:22.573 --> 01:55:27.875
Calypso, I release you
from your human bonds!

1214
01:55:37.454 --> 01:55:41.515
- Is that it?
- No, no, no. He didn't say it right.

1215
01:55:46.463 --> 01:55:47.487
He didn't...

1216
01:55:47.965 --> 01:55:49.830
You have to say it right.

1217
01:55:58.442 --> 01:55:59.431
Calypso...

1218
01:56:04.815 --> 01:56:07.249
...I release you from your human bonds.

1219
01:56:25.836 --> 01:56:27.531
Tia Dalma.

1220
01:56:29.973 --> 01:56:31.304
Calypso.

1221
01:56:33.777 --> 01:56:37.941
When the Brethren Court imprisoned you,
who was it that told them how?

1222
01:56:40.384 --> 01:56:44.286
- Who was it that betrayed you?
- Name him.

1223
01:56:45.556 --> 01:56:47.319
Davy Jones.

1224
01:57:01.338 --> 01:57:05.172
This is it! This is it!

1225
01:57:47.784 --> 01:57:49.547
Calypso!

1226
01:57:51.755 --> 01:57:56.886
I come before you as but a servant,
humble and contrite.

1227
01:57:58.795 --> 01:58:03.664
I have fulfilled me vow
and now ask your favor.

1228
01:58:06.703 --> 01:58:09.695
Spare meself, me ship, me crew...

1229
01:58:10.107 --> 01:58:14.567
...but unleash your fury upon those who
dare pretend themselves your masters...

1230
01:58:15.078 --> 01:58:16.238
...or mine.

1231
01:59:14.171 --> 01:59:15.433
Is that it?

1232
01:59:18.175 --> 01:59:20.166
Why, she's no help at all.

1233
01:59:23.880 --> 01:59:25.177
What now?

1234
01:59:26.083 --> 01:59:27.345
Nothing.

1235
01:59:28.151 --> 01:59:31.086
Our final hope has failed us.

1236
01:59:58.548 --> 02:00:01.540
- It's not over.
- There's still a fight to be had.

1237
02:00:01.618 --> 02:00:05.554
We've an armada against us, and
with the Dutchman, there's no chance.

1238
02:00:05.622 --> 02:00:07.920
There's only a fool's chance.

1239
02:00:07.991 --> 02:00:10.755
Revenge won't bring
your father back, Miss Swann,

1240
02:00:10.827 --> 02:00:14.092
and it's not something
I'm intending to die for.

1241
02:00:19.069 --> 02:00:20.559
You're right.

1242
02:00:25.942 --> 02:00:27.910
Then what shall we die for?

1243
02:00:31.615 --> 02:00:33.014
You will listen to me.

1244
02:00:33.750 --> 02:00:35.012
Listen!

1245
02:00:37.954 --> 02:00:43.017
The Brethren will still be looking here
to us, to the Black Pearl, to lead.

1246
02:00:43.593 --> 02:00:45.026
And what will they see?

1247
02:00:45.529 --> 02:00:48.862
Frightened bilge rats
aboard a derelict ship? No.

1248
02:00:48.932 --> 02:00:53.164
No, they will see free men and freedom!

1249
02:00:53.236 --> 02:00:56.672
And what the enemy will see
is the flash of our cannons.

1250
02:00:56.740 --> 02:01:01.973
They will hear the ring of our swords,
and they will know what we can do.

1251
02:01:04.681 --> 02:01:06.979
By the sweat of our brows,

1252
02:01:07.050 --> 02:01:09.382
and the strength of our backs...

1253
02:01:09.786 --> 02:01:12.778
...and the courage of our hearts.

1254
02:01:15.492 --> 02:01:16.982
Gentlemen...

1255
02:01:19.696 --> 02:01:21.163
...hoist the colors.

1256
02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:24.633
Hoist the colors.

1257
02:01:24.701 --> 02:01:26.999
- Hoist the colors.
- Hoist the colors!

1258
02:01:27.070 --> 02:01:29.129
Aye.

1259
02:01:29.206 --> 02:01:32.869
The wind's on our side, boys.
That's all we need!

1260
02:01:34.845 --> 02:01:36.938
Hoist the colors!

1261
02:02:27.998 --> 02:02:30.193
We have a favorable wind, sir.

1262
02:02:30.934 --> 02:02:32.128
Oh, so we do.

1263
02:02:32.769 --> 02:02:35.738
Signal Jones to give no quarter.

1264
02:02:36.773 --> 02:02:38.832
That should brighten his day.

1265
02:02:42.779 --> 02:02:46.715
To arms! We give no quarter!

1266
02:02:55.959 --> 02:02:57.756
Calypso.

1267
02:03:24.387 --> 02:03:27.322
Have you noticed,
on top of everything, it's raining?

1268
02:03:27.390 --> 02:03:28.448
That's a bad sign.

1269
02:03:28.525 --> 02:03:33.462
Man the capstan. Raise the main topyard.
Keep that powder dry.

1270
02:03:48.078 --> 02:03:49.909
Maelstrom!

1271
02:03:53.116 --> 02:03:55.141
Captain Barbossa!

1272
02:03:56.086 --> 02:03:58.111
We need you at the helm.

1273
02:04:00.624 --> 02:04:02.990
Aye, that be true.

1274
02:04:05.295 --> 02:04:10.255
Brace up yards,
you cack-handed deck apes.

1275
02:04:10.500 --> 02:04:14.402
Dying is the day worth living for.

1276
02:04:24.714 --> 02:04:26.341
Veer off!

1277
02:04:26.416 --> 02:04:28.680
She'll not harm us.

1278
02:04:29.185 --> 02:04:31.517
Full-bore and into the abyss.

1279
02:04:32.222 --> 02:04:33.553
Are you mad?

1280
02:04:33.623 --> 02:04:36.592
Ha! You afraid to get wet?

1281
02:04:46.136 --> 02:04:48.502
She's on our stern and gaining.

1282
02:04:48.571 --> 02:04:54.134
More speed!
Haul your wind and hold your water.

1283
02:05:01.117 --> 02:05:03.517
Bow cannons!

1284
02:05:04.020 --> 02:05:06.488
Blow the cannons!

1285
02:05:17.367 --> 02:05:20.268
Take us out or they'll overbear us.

1286
02:05:20.337 --> 02:05:25.240
Nay. Further in.
We'll cut across to faster waters.

1287
02:05:26.443 --> 02:05:28.536
Prepare to broadside.

1288
02:05:38.989 --> 02:05:41.253
Captain the guns. Bear a hand.

1289
02:05:41.324 --> 02:05:45.158
Muster your courage, men.
At the ready.

1290
02:05:52.335 --> 02:05:55.930
Think like the whelp. Think like
the whelp. Think like the whelp.

1291
02:05:56.006 --> 02:05:58.201
Hinges. Hinges.

1292
02:05:58.274 --> 02:05:59.571
Think like the whelp.

1293
02:05:59.642 --> 02:06:01.075
Half-barrel hinges.

1294
02:06:01.177 --> 02:06:02.474
Leverage.

1295
02:06:07.450 --> 02:06:09.680
Wish us luck, boys. We'll need it.

1296
02:06:11.154 --> 02:06:13.987
- I miss him already.
- He is quite charming, isn't he?

1297
02:06:14.057 --> 02:06:15.615
Nobody move.

1298
02:06:16.693 --> 02:06:18.456
I dropped me brain.

1299
02:06:28.338 --> 02:06:31.102
Batten down the hatches!

1300
02:06:32.409 --> 02:06:34.434
Stand to your guns.

1301
02:06:35.011 --> 02:06:37.502
Midship canoneers, sight the masts.

1302
02:06:41.751 --> 02:06:44.185
Main battery at the ready!

1303
02:06:48.758 --> 02:06:53.024
Hold there!
Wait till we're board-and-board.

1304
02:06:57.600 --> 02:06:59.329
Fire!

1305
02:06:59.702 --> 02:07:04.036
- Fire!
- Fire! Fire all!

1306
02:07:04.974 --> 02:07:06.134
Fire!

1307
02:07:10.013 --> 02:07:11.571
Fire!

1308
02:07:21.157 --> 02:07:22.624
Come on, men.

1309
02:07:32.635 --> 02:07:37.265
It be too late
to alter course now, mateys.

1310
02:07:41.644 --> 02:07:43.874
Halt there or we'll shoot.

1311
02:07:45.381 --> 02:07:46.507
Good one.

1312
02:07:48.985 --> 02:07:51.010
I just come to get me effects.

1313
02:07:52.622 --> 02:07:56.820
Admirable though it may be, why are
you here when you could be elsewhere?

1314
02:07:56.893 --> 02:07:59.157
Someone has to stay
and guard the chest.

1315
02:08:00.630 --> 02:08:05.192
There's no question, there's a breakdown
in military discipline on this vessel.

1316
02:08:05.268 --> 02:08:06.929
I blame the fish people.

1317
02:08:07.003 --> 02:08:11.372
Oh, so fish people,
by dint of being fish people,

1318
02:08:11.441 --> 02:08:14.672
automatically aren't
as disciplined as non-fish people?

1319
02:08:14.744 --> 02:08:17.110
Seems contributory,
is all I'm suggesting.

1320
02:08:17.180 --> 02:08:22.083
It's true, if there were no fish people,
there'd be no need to guard the chest.

1321
02:08:22.152 --> 02:08:25.588
And if there were no chest
we wouldn't need to be here to guard it.

1322
02:08:33.129 --> 02:08:35.154
Prepare to board!

1323
02:08:36.799 --> 02:08:37.993
Cover!

1324
02:08:54.651 --> 02:08:56.380
No!

1325
02:09:22.312 --> 02:09:27.272
Lookee here, boys. A lost bird.

1326
02:09:27.350 --> 02:09:31.252
A lost bird that never learned to fly.

1327
02:09:32.555 --> 02:09:34.318
To my great regret.

1328
02:09:35.625 --> 02:09:36.751
But...

1329
02:09:39.495 --> 02:09:41.486
...never too late to learn, eh?

1330
02:09:49.672 --> 02:09:51.139
Whoa!

1331
02:09:57.780 --> 02:10:01.113
The chest, hand it over.

1332
02:10:01.184 --> 02:10:03.015
I can set you free, mate.

1333
02:10:03.086 --> 02:10:06.112
My freedom was forfeited long ago.

1334
02:10:53.169 --> 02:10:54.500
Elizabeth.

1335
02:10:58.274 --> 02:10:59.502
Elizabeth.

1336
02:11:00.543 --> 02:11:01.908
Will you marry me?

1337
02:11:03.713 --> 02:11:05.544
I don't think now's the best time.

1338
02:11:09.352 --> 02:11:11.411
Now may be the only time.

1339
02:11:16.626 --> 02:11:17.820
I love you.

1340
02:11:23.766 --> 02:11:26.291
I've made my choice. What's yours?

1341
02:11:27.136 --> 02:11:28.433
Barbossa.

1342
02:11:29.906 --> 02:11:31.339
Marry us.

1343
02:11:32.442 --> 02:11:35.104
I'm a little busy at the moment.

1344
02:11:41.317 --> 02:11:43.308
Barbossa, now.

1345
02:11:44.987 --> 02:11:46.318
Fine, then.

1346
02:11:57.200 --> 02:12:00.328
Dearly beloved,
we be gathered here today...

1347
02:12:01.037 --> 02:12:04.564
To nail your gizzards
to the mast, you poxy cur.

1348
02:12:09.445 --> 02:12:12.471
Elizabeth Swann,
do you take me to be your husband?

1349
02:12:12.548 --> 02:12:14.516
- I do.
- Great.

1350
02:12:20.990 --> 02:12:23.254
Will Turner, do you take me...

1351
02:12:24.527 --> 02:12:26.256
...to be your wife...

1352
02:12:30.666 --> 02:12:32.634
...in sickness and in health...

1353
02:12:33.536 --> 02:12:35.766
...with health being the less likely?

1354
02:12:42.979 --> 02:12:44.207
I do.

1355
02:12:46.482 --> 02:12:49.383
As captain, I now pronounce you...

1356
02:12:52.355 --> 02:12:54.186
You may kiss...

1357
02:13:03.065 --> 02:13:04.498
You may kiss...

1358
02:13:09.472 --> 02:13:11.133
Just kiss.

1359
02:13:49.846 --> 02:13:51.507
Leave it.

1360
02:14:03.759 --> 02:14:06.421
You can do nothing without the key.

1361
02:14:06.496 --> 02:14:07.963
I already have the key.

1362
02:14:09.232 --> 02:14:10.665
No, you don't.

1363
02:14:12.168 --> 02:14:13.465
Oh, that key.

1364
02:14:49.539 --> 02:14:50.528
No!

1365
02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:20.091
Oi. My pistol.

1366
02:15:47.797 --> 02:15:49.196
Turner.

1367
02:15:54.203 --> 02:15:55.192
Fire!

1368
02:16:01.143 --> 02:16:02.701
Thank you, Jack.

1369
02:16:32.541 --> 02:16:34.065
Stop! It's me.

1370
02:16:36.579 --> 02:16:39.480
It's Will. Your son.

1371
02:17:08.277 --> 02:17:09.642
Ha!

1372
02:17:40.609 --> 02:17:42.076
Go!

1373
02:18:00.496 --> 02:18:04.557
Harridan! You'll see no mercy from me.

1374
02:18:04.633 --> 02:18:06.965
That's why I brought this.

1375
02:18:26.388 --> 02:18:29.619
I'm not going to kill you.
I made you a promise.

1376
02:18:38.234 --> 02:18:39.565
Missed.

1377
02:18:40.770 --> 02:18:45.639
Did you forget?
I'm a heartless wretch.

1378
02:19:02.191 --> 02:19:05.490
Ah. Love.

1379
02:19:05.861 --> 02:19:09.353
A dreadful bond.

1380
02:19:10.132 --> 02:19:15.126
And yet, so easily severed.

1381
02:19:15.204 --> 02:19:20.403
Tell me, William Turner,
do you fear death?

1382
02:19:20.476 --> 02:19:21.909
Do you?

1383
02:19:32.655 --> 02:19:36.352
Heady tonic, holding life and death
in the palm of one's hand.

1384
02:19:36.959 --> 02:19:41.362
You're a cruel man, Jack Sparrow.

1385
02:19:42.231 --> 02:19:44.665
Cruel is a matter of perspective.

1386
02:19:45.234 --> 02:19:46.792
Is it?

1387
02:20:12.561 --> 02:20:13.687
Will?

1388
02:20:15.297 --> 02:20:17.891
Look at me! Stay with me!
You're all right.

1389
02:20:23.772 --> 02:20:25.433
William?

1390
02:20:25.875 --> 02:20:27.570
My son.

1391
02:20:39.455 --> 02:20:42.947
Will? Will?
Look at me. Look at me!

1392
02:20:46.662 --> 02:20:50.564
You will not forestall my judgment.

1393
02:21:06.348 --> 02:21:08.009
Calypso.

1394
02:21:13.856 --> 02:21:19.317
She's taking us down! Make quick
or it's the Locker for us all!

1395
02:21:50.292 --> 02:21:51.350
No.

1396
02:21:55.464 --> 02:21:56.954
No, no.

1397
02:21:57.032 --> 02:21:58.761
No!

1398
02:22:00.035 --> 02:22:04.335
Part of the crew.
Part of the ship, part of the crew.

1399
02:22:04.406 --> 02:22:07.898
Part of the ship, part of the crew.

1400
02:22:07.977 --> 02:22:10.002
Don't leave me.

1401
02:22:11.313 --> 02:22:13.008
Don't. No!

1402
02:22:13.082 --> 02:22:14.947
I won't leave you.

1403
02:22:25.060 --> 02:22:27.255
The Dutchman must have a captain.

1404
02:22:30.599 --> 02:22:32.590
Hold on.

1405
02:23:26.321 --> 02:23:27.982
Thank goodness, Jack.

1406
02:23:28.057 --> 02:23:32.016
The armada's still out there. The
Endeavor's coming up hard to starboard,

1407
02:23:32.094 --> 02:23:36.190
and I think it's time we embrace that
oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.

1408
02:23:36.265 --> 02:23:38.893
Never actually been one for tradition.

1409
02:23:43.872 --> 02:23:46.898
Close haul her.
Luff the sails and lay her in irons.

1410
02:23:46.975 --> 02:23:49.239
Belay that,
or we'll be a sitting duck.

1411
02:23:49.311 --> 02:23:50.642
Belay that "belay that."

1412
02:23:50.712 --> 02:23:52.475
- But the arma...
- Belay.

1413
02:23:52.581 --> 02:23:54.845
- The Endeav...
- Stow. Shut it.

1414
02:24:07.930 --> 02:24:09.955
What are they waiting for?

1415
02:24:10.933 --> 02:24:13.902
He expects us to honor our agreement.

1416
02:24:16.071 --> 02:24:18.904
Ready guns and gun ports.

1417
02:24:22.644 --> 02:24:27.547
It's nothing personal, Jack.
It's just good business.

1418
02:24:54.409 --> 02:24:56.900
Ah, she survived.

1419
02:25:22.037 --> 02:25:25.404
- Ready on the guns.
- Guns ready.

1420
02:25:26.041 --> 02:25:28.202
Full canvas.

1421
02:25:28.277 --> 02:25:30.643
Aye, full canvas.

1422
02:25:55.170 --> 02:25:56.467
Orders, sir.

1423
02:25:59.942 --> 02:26:01.068
Sir!

1424
02:26:01.710 --> 02:26:02.699
Cap'n.

1425
02:26:03.145 --> 02:26:05.773
- Fire.
- Fire!

1426
02:26:05.847 --> 02:26:07.906
- Fire!
- Fire!

1427
02:26:07.983 --> 02:26:09.951
Fire, all!

1428
02:26:20.529 --> 02:26:23.430
Orders? Orders, sir?

1429
02:26:35.811 --> 02:26:37.278
Sir, what do you command?

1430
02:26:37.913 --> 02:26:39.244
It's just...

1431
02:26:41.350 --> 02:26:43.045
...good business.

1432
02:26:44.753 --> 02:26:46.084
Abandon ship!

1433
02:26:46.154 --> 02:26:50.181
- Abandon ship!
- All hands, abandon ship!

1434
02:28:15.944 --> 02:28:17.673
They're turning away!

1435
02:28:30.025 --> 02:28:31.890
Wind in your sails.

1436
02:28:37.132 --> 02:28:39.191
Shiver me timbers.

1437
02:29:00.188 --> 02:29:02.247
Captain Turner!

1438
02:29:16.905 --> 02:29:18.998
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Cap'n?

1439
02:29:20.208 --> 02:29:23.200
- You may throw my hat if you like.
- Aye, aye, cap'n.

1440
02:29:23.278 --> 02:29:24.973
Hooray!

1441
02:29:27.215 --> 02:29:28.978
Now go and get it.

1442
02:29:47.402 --> 02:29:48.994
Orders, sir?

1443
02:29:53.275 --> 02:29:57.302
You're no longer bound
to the Dutchman. You're free.

1444
02:29:57.379 --> 02:29:59.370
Aye.

1445
02:29:59.448 --> 02:30:01.848
That's a fine thing, but...

1446
02:30:03.452 --> 02:30:08.151
...by my reckoning,
I still have a debt that has to be paid.

1447
02:30:08.223 --> 02:30:09.815
If you'll have me.

1448
02:30:13.862 --> 02:30:15.727
On the wheel, then, Mr. Turner.

1449
02:30:17.098 --> 02:30:19.089
Aye, Captain Turner.

1450
02:30:34.049 --> 02:30:36.711
This ship
has a purpose again.

1451
02:30:36.785 --> 02:30:38.810
And where we are bound...

1452
02:30:39.488 --> 02:30:41.956
...she cannot come.

1453
02:30:42.023 --> 02:30:43.991
One day ashore.

1454
02:30:44.059 --> 02:30:46.152
Ten years at sea.

1455
02:30:47.128 --> 02:30:49.961
That's a steep price
for what's been done.

1456
02:30:52.133 --> 02:30:54.124
Depends on the one day.

1457
02:30:56.905 --> 02:30:59.465
Your chariot awaits, Your Highness.

1458
02:31:03.278 --> 02:31:05.269
The oars are inside.

1459
02:31:16.892 --> 02:31:18.860
Mrs. Turner.

1460
02:31:23.765 --> 02:31:25.323
Goodbye, poppet.

1461
02:31:31.139 --> 02:31:32.436
Jack.

1462
02:31:33.675 --> 02:31:36.200
It would never
have worked out between us.

1463
02:31:39.548 --> 02:31:42.016
Keep telling yourself that, darling.

1464
02:31:45.453 --> 02:31:47.318
Once was quite enough.

1465
02:31:49.724 --> 02:31:51.715
Thank you.

1466
02:32:11.046 --> 02:32:13.037
I'm going to need the other one.

1467
02:32:45.046 --> 02:32:47.037
It's nearly sunset.

1468
02:33:06.201 --> 02:33:07.896
It's always belonged to you.

1469
02:33:13.675 --> 02:33:15.233
Will you keep it safe?

1470
02:33:17.045 --> 02:33:18.205
Yes.

1471
02:33:22.217 --> 02:33:23.309
Yes.

1472
02:33:43.238 --> 02:33:44.227
Will!

1473
02:33:59.821 --> 02:34:01.982
Keep a weather eye on the horizon.

1474
02:34:30.852 --> 02:34:34.151
Granted it tends to list to port,
and has been, on occasion,

1475
02:34:34.222 --> 02:34:36.452
known to frighten young women.

1476
02:34:36.524 --> 02:34:40.893
But I promise you,
you will not be disappointed.

1477
02:34:41.596 --> 02:34:42.722
Is that it?

1478
02:34:43.331 --> 02:34:44.855
The Black Pearl.

1479
02:34:45.500 --> 02:34:47.593
It's not very big.

1480
02:34:47.669 --> 02:34:50.069
Love, that is a dinghy.

1481
02:34:50.138 --> 02:34:55.508
My vessel is magnificent
and fierce and huge-ish and...

1482
02:34:55.977 --> 02:34:59.105
...gone. Why is it gone?

1483
02:35:00.048 --> 02:35:01.640
Is that it there?

1484
02:35:02.851 --> 02:35:03.977
Yes, there it is.

1485
02:35:04.986 --> 02:35:06.214
Why is it there?

1486
02:35:07.589 --> 02:35:09.147
It's much larger up close.

1487
02:35:09.224 --> 02:35:11.590
Jack, you promised
to take us for a ride.

1488
02:35:11.659 --> 02:35:15.595
- I was to be given the first ride.
- What? You?

1489
02:35:15.663 --> 02:35:18.257
- Not what he said.
- I never!

1490
02:35:20.068 --> 02:35:24.198
Mr. Gibbs? Any particular reason
why my ship is gone?

1491
02:35:24.272 --> 02:35:27.105
The ship? We're on the ship.

1492
02:35:29.744 --> 02:35:32.611
Jack! The ship's gone!

1493
02:35:32.680 --> 02:35:33.738
Really?

1494
02:35:35.784 --> 02:35:39.049
Ladies! Will you please shut it?

1495
02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:42.487
Listen to me.
Yes, I lied to you.

1496
02:35:42.557 --> 02:35:44.047
No, I don't love you.

1497
02:35:44.125 --> 02:35:47.219
Of course it makes you look fat.
I've never been to Brussels.

1498
02:35:47.295 --> 02:35:50.025
It is pronounced "egregious."

1499
02:35:50.098 --> 02:35:54.125
By the way, no, I've never actually
met Pizarro, but I love his pies.

1500
02:35:54.202 --> 02:35:56.898
And all of this pales
to utter insignificance

1501
02:35:56.971 --> 02:36:00.702
in light of the fact that
my ship is once again gone. Savvy?

1502
02:36:13.254 --> 02:36:16.189
- Take what you can.
- Give nothing back.

1503
02:36:20.094 --> 02:36:24.121
Tell me, ladies,
what do you know of sea turtles?

1504
02:36:24.199 --> 02:36:25.291
Sea turtles?

1505
02:36:25.567 --> 02:36:27.797
Let me tell you
the amazing story of Cap...

1506
02:36:27.869 --> 02:36:30.531
All men up the ratlines.

1507
02:36:30.939 --> 02:36:33.737
All men up the ratlines!

1508
02:36:38.880 --> 02:36:41.110
Oh, you want a taste of this?

1509
02:36:42.617 --> 02:36:45.814
Oh, that's a good boy!
You're Daddy's boy.

1510
02:36:45.887 --> 02:36:48.515
Oh, yes, you are.
Oh, yes, you are.

1511
02:36:48.590 --> 02:36:49.579
Sir?

1512
02:36:50.959 --> 02:36:53.484
Some of the men don't feel
entirely settled

1513
02:36:53.561 --> 02:36:56.052
- about leaving Captain Jack behind.
- Again.

1514
02:36:56.197 --> 02:36:59.098
- Again.
- Is that so?

1515
02:36:59.367 --> 02:37:03.030
It would make us feel a whole lot
better regarding our fortunes

1516
02:37:03.104 --> 02:37:05.800
if we could see that item
you told us about.

1517
02:37:05.874 --> 02:37:08.035
- On the charts.
- Aye.

1518
02:37:08.142 --> 02:37:09.541
With our own eyes.

1519
02:37:09.611 --> 02:37:13.206
To help put an ease
to our burden of guilt, so to speak.

1520
02:37:13.648 --> 02:37:15.479
Ah.

1521
02:37:15.550 --> 02:37:17.780
Feast your eyes upon this, mateys.

1522
02:37:18.186 --> 02:37:20.711
There's more than one way
to live forever.

1523
02:37:20.788 --> 02:37:24.519
Gents, I give you
the Fountain of Youth.

1524
02:37:35.303 --> 02:37:37.168
