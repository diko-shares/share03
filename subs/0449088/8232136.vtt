182
00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.760
It is coincidence only.

183
00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.400
[gun cocks]

184
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.360
If you want to make a deal with Beckett,
you need what I offer.

185
00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:51.080
You cross Barbossa.
You are willing to cross Jack Sparrow.

186
00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.240
Why should I expect any better?

187
00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.120
I need the Black Pearl
to free my father.

188
00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.080
You're helping me to get it.

189
00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.600
[squawks] Uh-oh.

190
00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.440
Fire in the hole.

191
00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.120
[popping and exploding]

192
00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.840
[man screaming]

193
00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:38.800
Thank you, Jack.

194
00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.960
- [screeches]
- [squawk] Thank you, Jack.

195
00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.040
- You have the charts?
- And better yet.

196
00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.440
- A ship and a crew.
- Where's Sao Feng?

197
00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.320
He'll cover our escape
and meet us at Shipwreck Cove.

198
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.240
This way. Be quick.

199
00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.280
[Gibbs] Haul the snotters with a will!

200
00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.040
[Pintel] Keep it taut.

201
00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.120
[Gibbs] Secure provisions
and stow the cargo.

202
00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.000
There's no place left
for Sao Feng to cower.

203
00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.000
Do you think he will honor the call?

204
00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.520
I cannot say.

205
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.680
There's an evil on these seas

206
00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:26.080
that even the most staunch and
bloodthirsty pirates have come to fear.

207
00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.720
[cannon fire booming]

208
00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.640
A piece of eight.

209
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.080
Nine of them, you say.

210
00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.280
Our new friend in Singapore
was very specific, sir.

211
00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.920
Nine pieces of eight.

212
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.600
What's the significance of that,
I wonder.

213
00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.960
Nothing can hold against the armada.

214
00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.280
Not with the Flying Dutchman
at the lead.

215
00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.880
Nothing we know of.

216
00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:55.600
Did your friend mention
where the Brethren Court are meeting?

217
00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.400
He was mum on that, sir.

218
00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.960
Hmm.

219
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.440
Then he knows the value of information.

220
00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.280
Better keep this between ourselves.

221
00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.680
We don't want anyone
running off to Singapore, do we?

222
00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:15.280
- Ah, admiral.
- You summoned me, Lord Beckett.

223
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.080
Yes. Something for you there.

224
00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:21.520
Your new station deserves an old friend.

225
00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.640
- Not more requisition orders.
- No, sir.

226
00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.280
Execution.

227
00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.960
[sword unsheathed]

228
00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.320
The Brethren know they face extinction.

229
00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:53.720
All that remains is for them to decide
where they make their final stand.

230
00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.680
No one said anything about cold.

231
00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.520
I'm sure there must be
a good reason for our suffering.

232
00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:29.480
Why don't that obeah woman
bring Jack back the same way

233
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:34.080
- she brought back Barbossa?
- Because Barbossa was only dead.

234
00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:39.680
Jack Sparrow is taken, body and soul,

235
00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:44.880
to a place not of death, but punishment.

236
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.800
The worst fate a person
can bring upon himself...

237
00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.480
...stretching on forever.

238
00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:55.400
That's what awaits
at Davy Jones' Locker.

239
00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.960
Yeah. I knew there was a good reason.

240
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.400
[groaning]

241
00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.200
[shudders] Nothing here is set.

242
00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.600
These can't be
as accurate as modern charts.

243
00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:24.320
No. But it leads to more places.

244
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.920
"Over the edge.

245
00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.440
Over again."

246
00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.960
"Sunrise sets.

247
00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:42.040
Flash of green."

248
00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.920
Do you care to interpret,
Captain Barbossa?

249
00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:52.560
Ever gazed upon the green flash,
Master Gibbs?

250
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:57.200
I reckon I seen my fair share.
Happens on rare occasion.

251
00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:01.080
The last glimpse of sunset,
a green flash shoots up into the sky.

252
00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.480
Some go their whole lives
without ever seeing it.

253
00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.400
Some claim to have seen it who ain't.
And some say...

254
00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:11.640
It signals when a soul
comes back to this world from the dead.

255
00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.800
- Sorry.
- Trust me, young Master Turner.

256
00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:23.200
It's not getting to the land
of the dead that's the problem.

257
00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.200
It's getting back.

258
00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:12.440
[man] Bosun!
Head to wind! Lift the sail!

259
00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.760
[man 2] Aye, aye, sir!

260
00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.040
Bloody hell. There's nothing left.

261
00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.480
Jones is a loose cannon, sir.

262
00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:24.880
Fetch the chest.

263
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.760
And the governor?

264
00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:32.320
He's been asking questions
about the heart.

265
00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.720
Does he know?

266
00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.920
Then perhaps his usefulness
has run its course.

267
00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.520
- [organ playing]
- [sighing]

268
00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.920
[music box playing]

269
00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.400
[music box stops]

270
00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.200
[man] Step lively, men.

271
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.200
Step lively!

272
00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.480
Stand fast!

273
00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.880
Steady, men.

274
00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:09.520
Go. All of you.
And take that infernal thing with you.

275
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.560
I will not have it on my ship!

276
00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:16.160
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that...
because I will.

277
00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.160
Because it seems to be
the only way to ensure

278
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.640
that this ship do as directed
by the company.

279
00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.240
We need prisoners to interrogate,

280
00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:33.520
which tends to work best
when they're alive.

281
00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:37.520
The Dutchman sails
as its captain commands.

282
00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:41.480
And its captain
is to sail it as commanded.

283
00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:48.200
I would have thought you'd learned that
when I ordered you to kill your pet.

284
00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.880
This is no longer your world, Jones.

285
00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:57.040
The immaterial has become...

286
00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.920
...immaterial.

287
00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.120
[Norrington] Charge your bayonets.

288
00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:07.040
[heartbeat]

289
00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.480
How long do we continue not talking?

290
00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:51.040
Once we rescue Jack,
everything'll be fine.

291
00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.600
Then we rescue Jack.

292
00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:24.080
For what we want most...

293
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:29.360
...there is a cost
must be paid in the end.

294
00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:45.600
- Barbossa, ahead!
- Aye, we're good and lost now.

295
00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.160
- Lost?
- For certain you have to be lost

296
00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.200
to find a place as can't be found.

297
00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.640
Elseways, everyone
would know where it was.

298
00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.360
- We're gaining speed.
- Aye.

299
00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.000
To stations!

300
00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.480
All hands to stations!

301
00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.320
- [men shouting]
- Huh?

302
00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:07.280
Rudder full. Hard aport! Gather way.

303
00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:12.160
Nay! Belay that!
Let her run straight and true!

304
00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.320
Blimey.

305
00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:32.680
- You've doomed us all.
- Don't be so unkind.

306
00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.440
You may not survive
to pass this way again,

307
00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.360
and these be the last
friendly words you'll hear.

308
00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:45.360
Tie her off.

309
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:49.040
[muttering]

310
00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.720
Hard aport.

311
00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.400
[men shouting]

312
00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.520
Hold on!

313
00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:35.360
- [music playing]
- [cannons firing]

314
00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:40.080
[man laughs] Strike your colors,
you blooming cockroaches.

315
00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:45.680
[man 2] Dead men tell no tales.

316
00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.600
[echoing]

317
00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.200
[man sniffing]

318
00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.880
[gunshot]

319
00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.320
My peanut.

320
00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.960
Haul the halyard. Slacken braces.

321
00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.320
Aye, captain.
Slacken braces.

322
00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.520
Step lively with a will.

323
00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.200
-Aye, aye.
-Right away, sir.

324
00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.000
I want a fire down below!

325
00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.840
- Help.
- Man the yards, you filthy toads.

326
00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.200
[muffled groaning]

327
00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.800
[clucking]

328
00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:08.600
[all] Haul! Haul!

329
00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:11.520
Haul the sheets handsomely.
Scandalize the lateens.

330
00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.400
- Aye, sir.
- Right away, sir.

331
00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.360
- Mr. Sparrow?
- Aye, cap'n.

332
00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.880
What say you about
the condition of this tack line?

333
00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:37.040
- It be proper to my eyes, sir.
- Proper?

334
00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:40.960
It is neither proper nor suitable, sir.
It is not acceptable nor adequate.

335
00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.480
It is, in obvious fact, an abomination.

336
00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:47.040
Begging your pardon, sir,
but if you gave a man another chance.

337
00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.400
- Shall I?
- [unsheathes sword]

338
00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:56.440
It's that sort of thinking
got us into this mess.

339
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.080
We have lost speed and, therefore, time.

340
00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:06.360
Precious time,
which cannot be recovered once lost.

341
00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.240
Do you understand?

342
00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:11.400
- [all] Aye, aye, captain.
- Do you now?

343
00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:15.160
It will all have to be redone.
All of it.

344
00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.720
And let this serve
as a lesson to the lot of you.

345
00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:21.240
Doldrums, sir,
has the entire crew on edge.

346
00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:24.280
I have no sympathy
for any of you feculent maggots,

347
00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.240
and no more patience
to pretend otherwise.

348
00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:34.080
Gentlemen, I wash my hands
of this weirdness.

349
00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.040
No wind.

350
00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:48.480
Of course, there's no bloody wind.

351
00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:52.600
My soul I do swear for a breeze.

352
00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:57.480
Gust. Whisper. A tiny, miniature lick.

353
00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.800
Yes, sir, I know, but why?
Why would he do that?

354
00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.560
Because he's a lummox, isn't he?

355
00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:18.320
We shall have a magnificent
garden party and you're not invited.

356
00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:33.000
Shoo.

357
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.280
A rock.

358
00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:24.160
Now we're being followed by rocks.
Never had that before.

359
00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.440
Oh.

360
00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.520
A rope.

361
00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:37.480
[grunting]

362
00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.920
[panting]

363
00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:11.880
[rumbling]

364
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.840
[coughing and gagging]

365
00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:52.320
This truly is a godforsaken place.

366
00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:56.160
I don't see Jack.
I don't see anyone.

367
00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:59.120
He's here.

368
00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:02.480
Davy Jones never once
gave up that what he took.

369
00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.000
And does it matter?

370
00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:07.120
We're trapped here by your doing.
No different than Jack.

371
00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:15.440
Witty Jack is closer than you think.

372
00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.640
Impossible.

373
00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.240
Boat.

374
00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:14.560
Slap me thrice
and hand me to me mama. It's Jack.

375
00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.400
- It's the captain!
- A sight for sore eyes.

376
00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:27.560
[parrot] Hide the rum.

377
00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.560
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Aye, cap'n.

378
00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.000
I thought so.

379
00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:34.040
I expect you're able
to account for your actions, then.

380
00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.120
Sir?

381
00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:39.200
There's been a perpetual and virulent
lack of discipline upon my vessel. Why?

382
00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.640
- Why is that, sir?
- Sir, you're...

383
00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:45.280
You're in Davy Jones' Locker, cap'n.

384
00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:52.280
I know that.
I know where I am.

385
00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:56.560
- And don't think I don't.
- Jack Sparrow.

386
00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:59.160
Oh, Hector.

387
00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.160
It's been too long. Hasn't it?

388
00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:06.000
Aye. Isla de Muerta, remember?
You shot me.

389
00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.280
No, I didn't.

390
00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:11.440
Tia Dalma, out and about, eh?

391
00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:15.400
You add an agreeable sense
of the macabre to any delirium.

392
00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.680
He thinks we're a hallucination.

393
00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:21.200
William, tell me something:

394
00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:25.360
Have you come because you need my help
to save a certain distressing damsel,

395
00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:28.960
or rather, damsel in distress?
Either one.

396
00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:30.520
No.

397
00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.000
Well, then,
you wouldn't be here, would you?

398
00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:37.040
So you can't be here.
Q.E.D., you're not really here.

399
00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:38.520
[Elizabeth] Jack.

400
00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.600
This is real. We're here.

401
00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:56.240
- The Locker, you say?
- Aye.

402
00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:59.000
We've come to rescue you.

403
00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:04.120
Have you, now?
That's very kind of you.

404
00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.560
But it would seem that
as I possess a ship and you don't,

405
00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:11.760
you're the ones in need of rescuing,
and I'm not sure as I'm in the mood.

406
00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:16.160
I see my ship. Right there.

407
00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:21.200
Can't spot it.

408
00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:24.560
Must be a tiny little thing
hiding somewhere behind the Pearl.

409
00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:27.440
Jack, Cutler Beckett
has the heart of Davy Jones.

410
00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:30.920
- He controls the Flying Dutchman.
- He's taking over the seas.

411
00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:33.840
The song has been sung.
The Brethren Court is called.

412
00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:37.720
Leave you alone for a minute, look
what happens. Everything's gone to pot.

413
00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.400
Aye. The world
needs you back something fierce.

414
00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:42.280
And you need a crew.

415
00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.600
Why should I sail with any of you?

416
00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:50.160
Four of you have tried to kill me
in the past. One of you succeeded.

417
00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:57.360
Oh, she's not told you.

418
00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:00.280
You'll have loads to talk about
while you're here.

419
00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.120
As for you...

420
00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:10.200
Now... don't tell me
you didn't enjoy it at the time.

421
00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:13.240
Fair enough. All right, you're in.

422
00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:15.240
Don't need you. You scare me.

423
00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:19.160
Gibbs, you can come. Marty. Mm...

424
00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.920
- Cotton.
- [parrot squawks]

425
00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:25.520
Cotton's parrot, I'm a little iffy, but
at least I'll have someone to talk to.

426
00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:27.960
Who are you?

427
00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:30.320
Tai Huang. These are my men.

428
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.840
- Where do your allegiances lie?
- With the highest bidder.

429
00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:38.960
- I have a ship.
- That makes you the highest bidder.

430
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.080
Good man. Weigh anchor, all hands.
Prepare to make sail.

431
00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.320
[parrot] Weigh anchor.

432
00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.480
[Barbossa] Jack...

433
00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:54.440
Which way are you going, Jack?

434
00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:59.880
Trim that sail.
Slack windward brace and sheet.

435
00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:02.480
- Haul the pennant line.
- Haul the pennant line.

436
00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:04.000
What are you doing?

437
00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:06.680
- What are you doing?
- No, what are you doing?

438
00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:09.520
- What are you doing?
- No, what are you doing?

439
00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:12.080
What are you?
Captain gives orders on the ship.

440
00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:14.360
The captain of the ship
is giving orders.

441
00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:17.880
- My ship, makes me captain.
- They be my charts.

442
00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:20.480
That makes you "chartman."

443
00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:25.440
Stow it! The both of you!
That's an order! Understand?!

444
00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:34.480
Sorry. I just thought
with the captain issue in doubt,

445
00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:37.480
I'd throw in my name for consideration.

446
00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:38.840
Sorry.

447
00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:45.880
- I'd vote for you.
- Yeah?

448
00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:23.120
You left Jack to the Kraken.

449
00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.320
He's rescued now. It's done with.

450
00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.480
Will, I had no choice.

451
00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:34.600
You chose not to tell me.

452
00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:37.280
I couldn't.

453
00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.160
It wasn't your burden to bear.

454
00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:43.040
But I did bear it, didn't I?

455
00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.600
I just didn't know what it was.

456
00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:49.080
I thought...

457
00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.240
You thought I loved him.

458
00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:04.560
If you make your choices alone,
how can I trust you?

459
00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:08.880
You can't.

460
00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:29.640
[ship creaking]

461
00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:31.520
[gasps]

462
00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.600
Eerie.

463
00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.520
That's downright macabre.

464
00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:51.760
I wonder what would happen if you
dropped a cannonball on one of them?

465
00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:56.440
[both chuckling]

466
00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.840
Be disrespectful, it would.

467
00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:07.680
They should be
in the care of Davy Jones.

468
00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:12.520
That was the duty
him was charged with...

469
00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.520
...by the goddess, Calypso.

470
00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:21.200
To ferry those who die at sea
to the other side.

471
00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:26.440
And every ten years...

472
00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:29.360
...him could come ashore...

473
00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:34.720
...to be with she
who love him... truly.

474
00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:41.680
But the man has become a monster.

475
00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:46.320
So he wasn't always... tentacley?

476
00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:49.560
No.

477
00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:54.200
Him was a man...

478
00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:56.240
...once.

479
00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:05.560
Now there's boats coming.

480
00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:16.040
They're not a threat to us. Am I right?

481
00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:19.240
We are nothing but ghosts to them.

482
00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.600
It's best just let them be.

483
00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:38.520
It's my father. We've made it back.

484
00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:41.160
Father! Father, here, look here!

485
00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:44.080
Elizabeth.

486
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.520
We're not back.

487
00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:55.680
Father!

488
00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:02.480
Elizabeth. Are you dead?

489
00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:05.000
No. No.

490
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.720
I think I am.

491
00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.800
No, you can't be.

492
00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:13.800
There was this chest, you see.

493
00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:18.240
It's odd.
At the time it seemed so important.

494
00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:20.160
Come aboard.

495
00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.000
And a heart.

496
00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:27.320
I learned that if you stab the heart,
yours must take its place.

497
00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:30.920
And you will sail the seas for eternity.

498
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.000
The Dutchman must have a captain.

499
00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:37.040
Silly thing to die for.

500
00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:40.680
Someone, cast a line.
Come back with us!

501
00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:43.600
Come on.

502
00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:48.880
A touch... of destiny.

503
00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.040
Take the line.

504
00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:57.760
I'm so proud of you, Elizabeth.

505
00:50:57.840 --> 00:50:59.560
Father, the line! Take the line!

506
00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:05.680
- She must not leave the ship!
- Father!

507
00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:10.040
Please come with us!
Please! No! I won't leave you!

508
00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:12.720
I'll give your love to your mother.

509
00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:15.600
- Please, I won't let you go!
- Elizabeth.

510
00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:17.760
- Elizabeth.
- [sobbing]

511
00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:25.120
Is there a way?

512
00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.640
Him at peace.

513
00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:40.600
No water.

514
00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:43.840
Why is all but the rum gone?

515
00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:46.920
Rum's gone too.

516
00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:59.760
If we cannot escape
these doldrums before night,

517
00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:03.720
I fear we will sail on trackless seas.

518
00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:07.000
Doomed to roam the reach between worlds.

519
00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:08.920
Forever.

520
00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:12.920
With no water, forever
looks to be arriving a mite too soon.

521
00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:15.280
Why doesn't he do something?

522
00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:18.520
- [Ragetti] Me eye. Give it back!
- There's no sense to it.

523
00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:22.960
And the green flash
happens at sunset, not sunrise.

524
00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:27.960
[Gibbs] "Over the edge." Ah, it's
driving me over the blooming edge.

525
00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:30.560
Sunrises don't set.

526
00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.960
[Jack] "Up is down."

527
00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:39.520
Well, that's just maddeningly unhelpful.

528
00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:41.600
Why are these things never clear?

529
00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:44.480
- Clear as mud, Jackie.
- What? Eh?

530
00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:50.640
- Stab the heart.
- Don't stab the heart.

531
00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:53.880
- Come again?
- The Dutchman must have a captain.

532
00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:56.480
That's even more
than less than unhelpful.

533
00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:59.320
Sail the seas for eternity.

534
00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:02.320
- I love the sea.
- What about port?

535
00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:04.400
I prefer rum. Rum's good.

536
00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:09.480
Making port. Where we can get rum,
and salty wenches...

537
00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:13.480
- Once every 10 years.
- What'd he say?

538
00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:17.000
- Once every 10 years.
- Ten years is a long time, mate.

539
00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:19.400
Even longer given the deficit of rum.

540
00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:21.760
But eternity is longer still.

541
00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:25.520
And how will you be spending it? Dead?

542
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:27.600
Or not?

543
00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:31.520
- The immortal Captain Sparrow.
- Oh, I like that.

544
00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:34.160
Come sunset, it won't matter.

545
00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:38.680
Not sunset.

546
00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.160
Sundown.

547
00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:46.640
And rise. Up.

548
00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:49.120
What's that?

549
00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:55.040
What is that?
I don't know. What do you think?

550
00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:56.840
- Where?
- There.

551
00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.880
[Jack grunting, stammers]

552
00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:19.920
What is it?

553
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.840
He's rocking the ship.

554
00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:35.760
We're rocking the ship.

555
00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:42.760
Aye. He's onto it.

556
00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:45.000
[creaking]

557
00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:46.800
He's rocking the ship.

558
00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:49.240
We'll tie each other
to the mast upside down,

559
00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:52.000
so when the boat flips
we'll be the right way up.

560
00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:54.640
Time it with the swell.

561
00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:59.960
Loose the cannons, you lazy bilge rats.

562
00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:05.360
Unstow the cargo. Let it shift.

563
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.800
[crew shouting in Chinese]

564
00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:58.640
[ship creaking]

565
00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:02.280
[screaming]

566
00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:11.680
Now up...

567
00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:14.600
...is down.

568
00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:36.400
[coughing]

569
00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:46.760
[squawks]

570
00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:52.600
This was your idea.

571
00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:56.640
Blessed sweet westerlies!

572
00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:58.760
We're back!

573
00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:03.920
It's the sunrise.

574
00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:19.040
- [screeches]
- Parley?

575
00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:21.600
We need our pistols!
Get untied, hurry!

576
00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:38.440
All right, then!

577
00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:41.640
The Brethren Court
is a-gathering at Shipwreck Cove.

578
00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:45.400
And, Jack, you and I are a-going.
There'll be no arguing that point.

579
00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:46.880
I is arguing the point.

580
00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:50.560
If there's pirates a-gathering,
I'm pointing my ship the other way.

581
00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:54.080
The pirates are gathering
to fight Beckett, and you're a pirate.

582
00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:56.440
Fight or not,
you're not running, Jack.

583
00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:59.560
If we don't stand together,
they'll hunt us down one by one,

584
00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:01.240
till there be none left but you.

585
00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:07.640
Quite like the sound of that.
Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate.

586
00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:08.720
Aye.

587
00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:13.600
And you'll be fighting Jones alone.
How does that figure into your plan?

588
00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:15.680
I'm still working on that.

589
00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:20.240
But I will not be going back
to the Locker, mate. Count on that.

590
00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:21.360
[clicks]

591
00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:24.680
[guns clicking]

592
00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:27.240
Wet powder.

593
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.520
Wait! We can still use them as clubs!

594
00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:38.040
- Ow!
- Sorry. Effective, though.

595
00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:41.200
There's fresh water on this island.

596
00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:44.880
We can resupply there and get back
to shooting each other later.

597
00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:48.000
You lead the shore party.
I'll stay with my ship.

598
00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:50.880
I'll not be leaving
my ship in your command.

599
00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:54.600
Why don't you both go ashore
and leave the ship in my command.

600
00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:57.200
Temporarily.

601
00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:01.760
[telescope opening]

602
01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.560
[shouting]

603
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.560
[squawks] Mind the boat.

604
01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.520
- Criminy.
- Odds bodkins!

605
01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:48.000
[seagulls cawing]

606
01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:51.520
Careful! Careful!

607
01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:54.960
You stupid fish!

608
01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:57.080
Actually it's a cephalopod.

609
01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:58.760
Serves you right.

610
01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:01.880
[Ragetti] Pin, I bet people
would pay a shilling to see this.

611
01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:05.120
And another shilling
for a sketch of them sitting atop!

612
01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:08.200
Pintel and Ragetti, Kraken slayers.

613
01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:11.120
[Ragetti] We could serve up
a slice as a souvenir.

614
01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.800
Still thinking of running, Jack?

615
01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:17.040
Think you can outrun the world?

616
01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:26.560
You know, the problem
with being the last of anything...

617
01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:29.320
...by and by, there be none left at all.

618
01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:35.760
Sometimes things come back, mate.
We're living proof, you and me.

619
01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:38.960
Aye, but that's a gamble
of long odds, ain't it?

620
01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:42.320
There's never
a guarantee of coming back.

621
01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:45.520
But passing on, that's dead certain.

622
01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:51.840
Summoning the Brethren Court,
then, is it?

623
01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.680
It's our only hope, lad.

624
01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:58.040
That's a sad commentary
in and of itself.

625
01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:02.360
The world used to be a bigger place.

626
01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.960
The world's still the same.

627
01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:11.640
There's just... less in it.

628
01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:36.240
Poisoned. Fouled by the body.

629
01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:42.880
Eh, I know him. He was in Singapore!

630
01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:44.920
- [squawks] Singapore.
- Captain!

631
01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:48.880
Hoy!

632
01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:51.720
We got company!

633
01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:04.920
He's the captain.

634
01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.760
[shouting]

635
01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:16.680
Sao Feng...

636
01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:21.280
...you showing up here,
it is truly a remarkable coincidence.

637
01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:25.680
[Sao Feng] Jack Sparrow.

638
01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:29.760
You paid me great insult once.

639
01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.320
That doesn't sound like me.

640
01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.680
[groans]

641
01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:38.400
Shall we just call it square, then?

642
01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:40.120
Release her.

643
01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:44.760
- She's not part of the bargain.
- And what bargain be that?

644
01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:47.640
You heard Captain Turner.

645
01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:51.760
- Release her!
- "Captain Turner"?

646
01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:54.600
Aye, the perfidious rotter
led a mutiny against us!

647
01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:57.200
I need the Pearl to free my father.

648
01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:59.800
That's the only reason
I came on this voyage.

649
01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:03.120
Why didn't you tell me
you were planning this?

650
01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:05.440
It was my burden to bear.

651
01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:12.000
He needs the Pearl.
Captain Turner needs the Pearl.

652
01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:16.120
And you felt guilty.
And you and your Brethren Court.

653
01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:20.080
Did no one come to save me
just because they missed me?

654
01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.760
I'm standing with them.

655
01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:38.600
I'm sorry, Jack, but there is an
old friend who wants to see you first.

656
01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:42.320
I'm not certain I can survive
any more visits from old friends.

657
01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:46.920
Here is your chance to find out.

658
01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.040
Curious.

659
01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:01.240
Your friends appear
to be quite desperate, Jack.

660
01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:05.880
Perhaps they no longer believe that
a gathering of squabbling pirates

661
01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:07.880
can defeat the Flying Dutchman.

662
01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:12.040
And so despair leads to betrayal.

663
01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:16.480
But you and I are no strangers
to betrayal, are we?

664
01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.720
It's not here, Jack.

665
01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:23.560
What? What isn't?

666
01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:28.080
The heart of Davy Jones.
It's safely aboard the Dutchman,

667
01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:31.240
and so unavailable for use as leverage

668
01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:33.920
to satisfy your debt
to the good captain.

669
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.280
By my reckoning,
that account has been settled.

670
01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.480
[Beckett] By your death?

671
01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.600
And yet here you are.

672
01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:44.800
Close your eyes
and pretend it's all a bad dream.

673
01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.280
That's how I get by.

674
01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:50.840
And if Davy Jones
were to learn of your survival?

675
01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:52.920
[man] Ship oars.

676
01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:54.560
[man 2] Ship oars.

677
01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.400
Be on your guard, men.

678
01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:00.920
My men are crew enough.

679
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.160
Company ship, company crew.

680
01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:07.120
You agreed.
The Black Pearl was to be mine.

681
01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.440
And so it was.

682
01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:15.600
[Beckett] Perhaps you'll consider
an alternative arrangement.

683
01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:20.880
One which requires absolutely
nothing from you but information.

684
01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:32.040
Regarding the Brethren Court, no doubt.
In exchange for fair compensation?

685
01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:35.160
Square my debt with Jones...

686
01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:38.080
...guarantee my freedom?

687
01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:39.800
Of course.

688
01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:41.800
It's just good business.

689
01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:47.640
Were I in a divulgatory mood,
what then might I divulge?

690
01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:49.920
Everything.

691
01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:51.680
Where are they meeting?

692
01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:54.480
Who are the pirate lords?

693
01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:58.640
What is the purpose
of the nine pieces of eight?

694
01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:02.440
[man] Prepare the brig.

695
01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:10.000
Beckett agreed the Black Pearl
was to be mine.

696
01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:13.760
He's not going to give up the only ship
as can outrun the Dutchman, is he?

697
01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:25.240
Shame they're not bound to honor
the code of the Brethren, isn't it?

698
01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:28.560
Because honor's
a hard thing to come by nowadays.

699
01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:32.440
There is no honor
to remaining with the losing side.

700
01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:37.040
Leaving it for the winning side,
that's just good business.

701
01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:40.960
- The losing side, you say?
- They have the Dutchman.

702
01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:42.520
Now the Pearl!

703
01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:45.480
And what do the Brethren have?

704
01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:49.240
We have Calypso.

705
01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:59.360
[laughs] Calypso.

706
01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:03.480
An old legend.

707
01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:09.560
No. The goddess herself,
bound in human form.

708
01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:15.240
Imagine all the power of the seas
brought to bear against our enemy.

709
01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:20.600
I intend to release her.
But for that I need the Brethren Court.

710
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.560
All the Court.

711
01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:28.160
You can keep Barbossa.

712
01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:32.280
The belligerent homunculus and
his friend with the wooden eye, both.

713
01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:34.920
And Turner. Especially Turner.

714
01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:38.400
The rest go with me on the Pearl.
I'll lead you to Shipwreck Cove,

715
01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:42.840
where I will hand you the pirates
and you will not hand me to Jones.

716
01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:47.440
- Bloody fair deal, don't you think?
- And what becomes of Miss Swann?

717
01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:52.320
What interest is she to you?

718
01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:57.240
What are you proposing, captain?

719
01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:00.280
What be accepting, cap'n?

720
01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:04.120
- The girl.
- What?

721
01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:05.760
Jack.

722
01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:08.240
I've just recalled.

723
01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:13.280
I've got this wonderful compass,
which points to whatever I want.

724
01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:16.120
So for what do I need you?

725
01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.200
Elizabeth is not part of any bargain.

726
01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.320
Out of the question.

727
01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:22.200
It was not a question.

728
01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:24.040
Points to the thing you want most.

729
01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:26.280
And that is not
the Brethren Court, is it?

730
01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:29.640
- Then what is, Jack?
- Me.

731
01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.720
- Dead.
- Done.

732
01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:35.480
What? Not done.

733
01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:38.080
You got us into this.
If it frees us, then done!

734
01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.280
Damn.

735
01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:47.240
Although, if I kill you,
then I can use the compass

736
01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:51.840
to find Shipwreck Cove,
is it, on my own.

737
01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:54.480
Cut out the middle man, as it were.

738
01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.320
Elizabeth, they are pirates.

739
01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:59.880
I have had more than enough
experience dealing with pirates!

740
01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:02.840
Then we have an accord?

741
01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:07.280
With me killed,
you'd arrive at the cove,

742
01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:10.560
find it a stronghold,
nigh impregnable...

743
01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:13.560
...able to withstand blockade for years.

744
01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:18.160
Then you'd be wishing, "If only there
was someone I had not killed inside

745
01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:21.760
to ensure that the pirates
then come outside."

746
01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.520
And you can accomplish all this?

747
01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:28.880
You may kill me,
but you may never insult me.

748
01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:30.320
Who am I?

749
01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.320
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

750
01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.080
[rumbling]

751
01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:39.320
Done!

752
01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:53.120
- [man shouting]
- [cannon fire]

753
01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:13.720
[man] Man overboard!

754
01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.040
You're mad.

755
01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:32.600
Thank goodness.
If I wasn't, this'd probably never work.

756
01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.560
[Jack shouting]

757
01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:53.440
And that was without
even a single drop of rum.

758
01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:05.720
Send this pestilent, traitorous,
cowhearted, yeasty codpiece to the brig.

759
01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:09.640
Which ship do we follow?

760
01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:14.320
Signal the Dutchman to track down
Sao Feng. We follow the Pearl.

761
01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:17.840
How soon can we have
the ship ready to pursue?

762
01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:20.240
[wood cracking]

763
01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:22.000
[man] She's going down!

764
01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:23.640
[man 2] Stand clear!

765
01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:32.640
Do you think he plans it all out,
or just makes it up as he goes along?

766
01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.480
Sir.

767
01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.560
[speaking Chinese]

768
01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:23.920
By this time tomorrow, we will arrive
at Shipwreck Cove and you will be free.

769
01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:27.880
Calypso.

770
01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:30.400
Excuse me?

771
01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:35.560
Not a name you fancy, I imagine,
out of the many that you have...

772
01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:37.760
...but it is what we call you.

773
01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:40.880
We being who?

774
01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:47.400
You confirm it.

775
01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:50.200
Confirm what?

776
01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:56.080
- You've told me nothing.
- The Brethren Court, not I.

777
01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:00.720
The First Brethren Court,
whose decision I would have opposed.

778
01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.760
They bound you to human form

779
01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:07.240
so the rule of the seas
would belong to man and not...

780
01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:09.080
To me.

781
01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:16.560
But one such as you should never
be anything less than what you are.

782
01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:19.200
Pretty speech from a captor.

783
01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:23.280
But words whispered
through prison bars lose their charm.

784
01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:26.600
Can I be blamed for my efforts?

785
01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:32.840
All men are drawn to the sea,
perilous though it may be.

786
01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:36.720
And some men offer desire
as justification for their crimes.

787
01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:40.280
I offer simply my desire.

788
01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:43.280
And in return?

789
01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:48.280
I would have your gifts,
should you choose to give them.

790
01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:56.360
And if I should choose not?

791
01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:59.840
Then I will take...

792
01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:02.200
...your fury.

793
01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:07.040
[grunting]

794
01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:09.200
[Elizabeth panting]

795
01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:19.480
[pirates shouting]

796
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.320
Sao Feng?

797
01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:32.000
Here.

798
01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:33.880
Please.

799
01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:43.280
With all nine pieces of eight...

800
01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:47.840
...you will be free.

801
01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:50.800
Take it!

802
01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.480
You are captain now.

803
01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:56.680
Me?

804
01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:03.920
Go in my place to Shipwreck Cove.

805
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.560
Captain! The ship is taken.
We cannot...

806
01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:13.560
Forgive me... Calypso.

807
01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:21.680
[explosions and shouting]

808
01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:23.920
Sao.

809
01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:30.720
What did he tell you?

810
01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:37.680
He made me captain.

811
01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:42.200
Set! Fire!

812
01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.640
You are not my captain.

813
01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:51.240
Elizabeth.

814
01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:53.680
James. James.

815
01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.400
Thank God, you're alive.

816
01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:02.680
Your father'll be overjoyed

817
01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:05.600
- to know you're safe.
- My father's dead.

818
01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:08.760
No, that can't be true.
He returned to England.

819
01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:11.720
Did Lord Beckett tell you that?

820
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.760
Who among you
do you name as captain?

821
01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:17.360
Captain. Her.

822
01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:19.120
[all] Her.

823
01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:23.080
Captain?

824
01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:26.760
Tow the ship.
Put the prisoners in the brig.

825
01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:30.080
The captain shall have my quarters.

826
01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.120
Thank you, sir.

827
01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:36.920
- But I prefer to remain with my crew.
- Elizabeth.

828
01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:38.440
I swear.

829
01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:40.440
I did not know.

830
01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:44.680
Know what?
Which side you chose?

831
01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:54.480
Well, now you do.

832
01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:04.160
Bootstrap?

833
01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:09.960
[chuckling]

834
01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:14.040
Bootstrap.

835
01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:15.800
Bill Turner?

836
01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:18.040
[man] Bootstrap.

837
01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:29.120
You know my name.

838
01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:34.000
Yes, I know your son.

839
01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:37.600
Will Turner.

840
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.160
William.

841
01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.520
He made it. He's alive.

842
01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:52.800
And now he sends you to tell me
that he's coming to get me.

843
01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:57.160
God's wounds. He's on his way.

844
01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:58.560
Yes, Will is alive.

845
01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:01.600
And he wants to help you.

846
01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:10.720
He can't help me. He won't come.

847
01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.040
But you're his father.

848
01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:15.640
I know you.

849
01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:18.040
He spoke of you.

850
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.200
He can't save me.
He can't come because of you.

851
01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:25.560
Me?

852
01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:28.840
You're Elizabeth.

853
01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:31.680
Yes, I'm Elizabeth.

854
01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:38.440
If Jones be slain,
he who slays him must take his place.

855
01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.920
Captain... Forever.

856
01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:47.760
The Dutchman
must always have a captain.

857
01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:50.560
And if he saves me...

858
01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:53.600
...he loses you.

859
01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:57.680
I see.

860
01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:01.520
He won't pick me.

861
01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:04.600
I wouldn't pick me.

862
01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:11.240
Tell him not to come.

863
01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:15.560
Tell him to stay away.

864
01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:18.920
Tell him it's too late.

865
01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:22.760
I'm already a part of the ship...

866
01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:26.440
...and the crew.

867
01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:29.640
Bootstrap.

868
01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:34.600
You know my name.

869
01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:37.600
You know my name.

870
01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:40.640
Yes, I know your son.

871
01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:43.360
William.

872
01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:47.920
He's coming for me.

873
01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:50.160
Wait and see.

874
01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:52.560
You'll see.

875
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.720
He promised.

876
01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:14.080
[man] Swing her over.

877
01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:17.040
Ready those lines.

878
01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:29.960
Sir.

879
01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.200
[Beckett] A breadcrumb trail.

880
01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:39.600
- And we're meant to follow.
- A betrayer among them?

881
01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:44.880
- Or a trap?
- A gambit by a skilled opponent.

882
01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:50.160
- Adjust course, lieutenant.
- Sir?

883
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.240
We can only hope
to reach our destination

884
01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:56.400
before they run out of bodies.

885
01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.080
You escaped the brig
even quicker than I expected.

886
01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.400
William, do you notice anything?

887
01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:20.320
Rather...

888
01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:24.240
...do you notice something
that is not there to be noticed?

889
01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:28.040
- You haven't raised an alarm.
- Odd, isn't it?

890
01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:29.600
Not as odd as this.

891
01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:33.400
Come up with this
all by your lonesome, did you?

892
01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:36.560
I said to myself, "Think like Jack."

893
01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:39.080
This is what you've arrived at?

894
01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:42.520
Lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove
so as to gain his trust...

895
01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:44.440
...accomplish your own ends?

896
01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:46.240
It's like you don't know me at all.

897
01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:52.680
And how does your dearly beloved
feel about this plan?

898
01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:55.400
Ah.

899
01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.520
You've not seen fit
to trust her with it.

900
01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:03.440
I'm losing her, Jack.

901
01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:08.120
Every step I make for my father
is a step away from Elizabeth.

902
01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:12.280
If you choose to lock your heart away,
you'll lose her for certain.

903
01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:16.040
If I might lend a machete
to your intellectual thicket...

904
01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:19.160
...avoid the choice altogether.

905
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.480
Change the facts.

906
01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:25.560
Let someone else dispatch Jones.

907
01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:27.640
Who?

908
01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:32.920
You?

909
01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:38.640
Death has a curious way
of reshuffling one's priorities.

910
01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:42.280
I slip aboard the Dutchman,
find the heart, stab the beating thing,

911
01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:44.120
your father's free from his debt,

912
01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:46.920
you're free to be
with your charming murderess.

913
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.840
You're willing to cut out your heart
and bind yourself to the Dutchman...

914
01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:54.840
- ...forever?
- No, mate. I'm free forever.

915
01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:58.960
Free to sail the seas beyond the edges
of the map. Free from death itself.

916
01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:01.320
You have to do the job though, Jack.

917
01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:04.520
You have to ferry souls
to the next world.

918
01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:07.720
- Or end up just like Jones.
- [groans]

919
01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:11.800
I don't have the face for tentacles.

920
01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:16.200
But immortal has to
count for something, eh?

921
01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:21.360
What's this for?

922
01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:24.160
Think like me. It'll come to you.

923
01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:39.800
My regards to Davy Jones.

924
01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:46.560
I hate him.

925
01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:52.240
Come with me.

926
01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:57.040
Quickly.

927
01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:07.360
What are you doing?

928
01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:11.080
Choosing a side.

929
01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:32.240
[whispering in Chinese]

930
01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:39.560
Do not go to Shipwreck Cove. Beckett
knows of the meeting of the Brethren.

931
01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:41.920
I fear there may be
a traitor among them.

932
01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:45.440
It's too late to earn my forgiveness.

933
01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:49.440
I had nothing to do
with your father's death.

934
01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:54.640
But that does not absolve me
of my other sins.

935
01:25:58.200 --> 01:25:59.280
Come with us.

936
01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:05.040
James, come with me.

937
01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:08.120
[Bootstrap Bill] Who goes there?

938
01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:12.840
Go. I will follow.

939
01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:16.160
You're lying.

940
01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:21.760
Our destinies have been entwined,
Elizabeth...

941
01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:25.640
...but never joined.

942
01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:33.880
Go, now.

943
01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:42.000
Back to your station, sailor.

944
01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:49.120
- No one leaves the ship.
- Stand down. That's an order.

945
01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:50.880
That's an order.

946
01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:54.640
Part of the crew, part of the ship.

947
01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:57.480
Part of the crew,
part of the ship. Part of the crew...

948
01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:00.440
- Steady, man.
- Part of the crew, part of the ship.

949
01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:02.880
All hands, prisoner escape!

950
01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:05.480
- Belay that!
- James!

951
01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:14.920
[screaming]

952
01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:19.320
[man] Prisoner escape!

953
01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:23.400
James! No!

954
01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:35.280
- The admiral's dead.
- Admiral's dead?

955
01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:37.400
- The admiral's dead.
- Admiral's dead.

956
01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:43.200
- To the captain's cabin!
- [all] Aye!

957
01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:45.240
Back to the ship.

958
01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:51.160
James Norrington. Do you fear death?

959
01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:02.560
I take that as a "no."

960
01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:08.600
Nice sword.

961
01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:34.600
The Dutchman is under my command.

962
01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:39.400
For now.

963
01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:57.240
Look alive and keep a weather eye.

964
01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:59.720
Not for naught
it's called Shipwreck Island.

965
01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:03.240
Where lies Shipwreck Cove
and the town of Shipwreck.

966
01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:05.720
You heard him. Step lively.

967
01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:08.160
For all that pirates are clever clogs,

968
01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:11.040
we are unimaginative
when it comes to naming things.

969
01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:12.320
Aye.

970
01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:16.520
I once sailed with a geezer who lost
both of his arms and part of his eye.

971
01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:18.200
What'd you call him?

972
01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:20.600
Larry.

973
01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:27.280
I do not renege
on a bargain once struck.

974
01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:29.320
But we agreed on ends only.

975
01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:32.360
The means are mine to decide.

976
01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:34.960
Caution, Barbossa.

977
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:39.280
Do not forget it was by my power
you return from the dead.

978
01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:43.200
Or what it mean if you fail me.

979
01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:49.320
Don't you forget
why you had to bring me back.

980
01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:53.120
Why I could not leave Jack
to his well-deserved fate.

981
01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:56.520
It took nine pirate lords
to bind you, Calypso.

982
01:29:57.080 --> 01:30:00.360
And it'll take no less than nine
to set you free.

983
01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:02.640
Masters Pintel and Ragetti.

984
01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:07.600
Take this fishwife to the brig.

985
01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:11.520
Right this way, Mrs. Fish.

986
01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:43.400
I cannot be summoned
like some mongrel pup.

987
01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:45.400
Apparently, you can.

988
01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:47.560
I believe you know each other.

989
01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:52.120
[chuckles]

990
01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:56.320
Come to join my crew again,
Master Turner?

991
01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:57.760
Not yours.

992
01:30:58.200 --> 01:30:59.440
His.

993
01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:02.440
Jack Sparrow sends his regards.

994
01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:05.400
Sparrow?

995
01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:08.440
You didn't tell him.

996
01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:11.720
We rescued Jack from the Locker
along with the Black Pearl.

997
01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:15.400
What else have you not told me?

998
01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:20.160
There is an issue far more troublesome.

999
01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:25.120
I believe you're familiar
with a person called Calypso.

1000
01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:29.440
Not a person.

1001
01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:31.240
A heathen god.

1002
01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:34.840
One who delights in cursing men
with their wildest dreams

1003
01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:38.240
and then revealing them to be
hollow and naught but ash.

1004
01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:41.480
- The world is well rid of her.
- Not quite so well, actually.

1005
01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:44.960
The Brethren Court
intends to release her.

1006
01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:47.560
No! They cannot!

1007
01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:50.600
The First Court
promised to imprison her forever.

1008
01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:53.640
- That was our agreement.
- Your agreement?

1009
01:31:56.160 --> 01:32:00.160
I showed them how to bind her.

1010
01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:02.200
She could not be trusted.

1011
01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:04.120
I... She gave me no choice.

1012
01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:07.600
We must act before they release her.

1013
01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:09.440
You loved her.

1014
01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:12.640
She's the one.

1015
01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:14.720
And then you betrayed her.

1016
01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:18.600
She pretended to love me.

1017
01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:22.400
She betrayed me.

1018
01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:28.800
And after which betrayal
did you cut out your heart, I wonder.

1019
01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:34.760
Do not test me.

1020
01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:36.560
I hadn't finished that.

1021
01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:40.680
You will free my father.

1022
01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:43.840
And you will guarantee
Elizabeth's safety.

1023
01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:45.520
Along with my own.

1024
01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:48.200
Your terms are steep, Mr. Turner.

1025
01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:51.040
We will expect fair value in return.

1026
01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:55.360
There is only one price I will accept:

1027
01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:58.560
Calypso murdered.

1028
01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:02.760
Calypso's aboard the Black Pearl.

1029
01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:08.200
Jack has sailed
the Black Pearl to Shipwreck Cove.

1030
01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:14.480
And with you no longer aboard her,
how do you propose to lead us there?

1031
01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:28.920
What is it you want most?

1032
01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:02.400
Look at them all.

1033
01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:06.560
There's not been a gathering
like this in our lifetime.

1034
01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:09.360
And I owe them all money.

1035
01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:13.480
[murmuring]

1036
01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:17.240
As he who issued summons,

1037
01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:21.880
I convene this,
the Fourth Brethren Court.

1038
01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:24.760
[murmuring]

1039
01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:29.440
To confirm your lordship
and right to be heard,

1040
01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:34.240
present now your pieces of eight,
my fellow cap'ns.

1041
01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:45.600
Those aren't pieces of eight.
They're just pieces of junk.

1042
01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:49.400
Aye. The original plan was to use
nine pieces of eight to bind Calypso.

1043
01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:53.840
But when the First Court met,
the Brethren were to a one skint broke.

1044
01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:55.560
So change the name.

1045
01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:01.000
To "nine pieces of whatever we happened
to have in our pockets at the time?"

1046
01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:03.360
Oh, yes. That sounds very piratey.

1047
01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.520
Master Ragetti, if you will.

1048
01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:13.360
I kept it safe, just like
you said when you gave it to me.

1049
01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:16.520
Aye, you have.
But now I need it back.

1050
01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:20.480
Sparrow.

1051
01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:30.200
Might I point out that
we are still short one pirate lord,

1052
01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:34.240
and I'm as content as a cucumber
to wait until Sao Feng joins us.

1053
01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:35.920
[Elizabeth] Sao Feng is dead.

1054
01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:40.160
He fell to the Flying Dutchman.

1055
01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:41.520
The plagued ship.

1056
01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:46.160
He made you captain? They're
giving the bloody title away now.

1057
01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:49.200
- ¡Qué lo manden al diablo!
- Listen. Listen to me.

1058
01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:51.520
Our location has been betrayed.

1059
01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:55.200
Jones is under the command of
Lord Beckett. They're on their way here.

1060
01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:58.960
- Who is this betrayer?
- Not likely anyone among us.

1061
01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:01.400
- Where's Will?
- Not among us.

1062
01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:04.200
It matters not how they found us.
The question is,

1063
01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:06.720
what will we do now that they have?

1064
01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:08.320
We fight.

1065
01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:15.840
Shipwreck Cove is a fortress.

1066
01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:18.720
A well-supplied fortress.

1067
01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:23.080
There is no need to fight
if they cannot get to us.

1068
01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:27.240
There be a third course.

1069
01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:30.920
In another age, at this very spot,

1070
01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:36.480
the First Brethren Court captured the
sea goddess and bound her in her bones.

1071
01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:40.640
That was a mistake.

1072
01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:44.440
Oh, we tamed the seas
for ourselves, aye.

1073
01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:48.480
But opened the door
to Beckett and his ilk.

1074
01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:52.960
Better were the days
when mastery of seas

1075
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.800
came not from bargains
struck with eldritch creatures,

1076
01:36:56.920 --> 01:37:01.280
but from the sweat of a man's brow
and the strength of his back alone.

1077
01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:03.160
You all know this to be true.

1078
01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.360
Gentlemen.

1079
01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:07.640
Ladies.

1080
01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:15.280
We must free Calypso.

1081
01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:24.240
[clamoring]

1082
01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:26.720
- Shoot him.
- Cut out his tongue!

1083
01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:30.680
Shoot him, cut out his tongue, then
shoot his tongue. And trim that beard.

1084
01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:33.320
Sao Feng would've agreed with Barbossa.

1085
01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:36.280
Calypso was our enemy then,
she will be our enemy now.

1086
01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:38.280
It's unlikely her mood's improved.

1087
01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:42.160
I would still agree with Sao Feng.
We release Calypso.

1088
01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:45.160
- You threaten me?
- I silence you.

1089
01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:48.320
[all shouting]

1090
01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:00.600
- This is madness.
- This is politics.

1091
01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:03.280
Meanwhile, our enemies
are bearing down upon us.

1092
01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:05.840
If they not be here already.

1093
01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:08.400
[shouting and gunfire in distance]

1094
01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:16.720
[music box playing]

1095
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.320
[music box stops]

1096
01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:32.560
[another music box playing]

1097
01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:44.440
My sweet.

1098
01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:46.880
You come for me.

1099
01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:52.800
- You were expecting me.
- It has been torture.

1100
01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:57.120
Trapped in this single form.

1101
01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:00.040
Cut off from the sea.

1102
01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:03.080
From all that I love.

1103
01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:05.760
From you.

1104
01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:11.000
Ten years I devoted
to the duty you charged to me.

1105
01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:17.760
Ten years I looked after
those who died at sea.

1106
01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:23.000
And, finally,
when we could be together again...

1107
01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:28.600
- ...you weren't there.
- [music box stops]

1108
01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:31.600
Why weren't you there?

1109
01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:36.600
It's my nature.

1110
01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:42.440
Would you love me
if I was anything but what I am?

1111
01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:47.400
I do not love you.

1112
01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:53.640
Many things you were, Davy Jones.

1113
01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:56.800
But never cruel.

1114
01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:00.640
You have corrupted your purpose...

1115
01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:04.600
...and so your self.

1116
01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:10.520
And you did hide away
what should always have been mine.

1117
01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:12.960
[gasping]

1118
01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:33.480
Calypso.

1119
01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:38.360
I will be free.

1120
01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:44.000
And when I am,
I would give you my heart.

1121
01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:47.800
And we would be together always.

1122
01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:51.800
If only you had a heart to give.

1123
01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:58.640
Why did you come?

1124
01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:21.080
And what fate have you planned
for your captors?

1125
01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:23.520
The Brethren Court?

1126
01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:30.240
All of them, the last thing
they will learn in this life...

1127
01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:33.040
...is how cruel I can be.

1128
01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:42.080
And what of your fate, Davy Jones?

1129
01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:47.080
My heart will always belong to you.

1130
01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:55.560
- [shouting]
- [glass breaking]

1131
01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:04.240
It was the First Court
what imprisoned Calypso.

1132
01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:06.600
We should be the ones to set her free.

1133
01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:11.000
And in her gratitude,
she will see fit to grant us boons.

1134
01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:13.560
Whose boons? Your boons?

1135
01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:16.600
Utterly deceptive twaddle-speak, says I.

1136
01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:21.120
If you have a better alternative,
please, share.

1137
01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:23.400
Cuttlefish.

1138
01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:26.640
Aye.

1139
01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:30.280
Let us not, dear friends,

1140
01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:33.320
forget our dear friends, the cuttlefish.

1141
01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:36.080
Flipping glorious little sausages.

1142
01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:40.120
Pen them up together, they'll devour
each other without a second thought.

1143
01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:41.440
Human nature, isn't it?

1144
01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:43.560
Or... Or fish nature.

1145
01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:47.360
So, yes, we could hole up here
well-provisioned and well-armed.

1146
01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:49.600
Half of us would be dead
within the month.

1147
01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:53.600
Which seems quite grim to me,
any way you slice it. Or...

1148
01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:56.800
Uh...

1149
01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:04.320
As my learned colleague
so naively suggests,

1150
01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:08.360
we can release Calypso, and we
can pray that she will be merciful.

1151
01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:11.160
I rather doubt it.

1152
01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:15.960
Can we pretend she's anything
other than a woman scorned

1153
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.880
like which fury hell hath no? We cannot.

1154
01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:23.320
Res ipsa loquitur, tabula in naufragio.

1155
01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:26.160
We are left with but one option.

1156
01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:30.080
I agree with, and I cannot believe
the words are coming out of me mouth...

1157
01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:35.360
...Captain Swann. We must fight.

1158
01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:38.640
- You've always run away from a fight.
- Have not.

1159
01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:39.760
- Have so.
- Have not.

1160
01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:40.960
- Have so.
- Have not!

1161
01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:44.280
- You have so, and you know it.
- Have not. Slander and calumny.

1162
01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:48.640
I have only ever embraced that
oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.

1163
01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:52.920
I submit that here now
that is what we all must do:

1164
01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:54.360
We must fight...

1165
01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:56.640
...to run away.

1166
01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:59.040
- Aye!
- [all] Aye!

1167
01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:05.240
As per the code, an act of war,
and this be exactly that,

1168
01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:08.200
can only be declared by the pirate king.

1169
01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:10.880
- You made that up.
- Did I, now?

1170
01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:15.480
I call on Cap'n Teague,
keeper of the code.

1171
01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:19.880
Sri Sumbhajee proclaims
this all to be folly!

1172
01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:24.080
- Hang the code. Who cares a...?
- [gunshot]

1173
01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:33.920
Code is the law.

1174
01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:47.920
You're in my way, boy.

1175
01:44:57.080 --> 01:44:59.760
- The code.
- The code.

1176
01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:02.080
As set forth by Morgan and Bartholomew.

1177
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.280
[whistles]

1178
01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:24.080
- That can't... How did...
- Sea turtles, mate.

1179
01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:25.440
[barks]

1180
01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:28.440
Sea turtles.

1181
01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:45.920
Ah. Barbossa is right.

1182
01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:47.480
[Jack] Hang on a minute.

1183
01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:50.960
"It shall be the duties, as the king,

1184
01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:54.480
to declare war,
parley with shared adversaries..."

1185
01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:55.520
Fancy that.

1186
01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:58.080
There has not been a king
since the First Court.

1187
01:45:58.160 --> 01:45:59.840
And that's not likely to change.

1188
01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:01.920
- Not likely.
- Why not?

1189
01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:04.640
See, the pirate king
is elected by popular vote.

1190
01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:08.240
And each pirate
only ever votes for hisself.

1191
01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:09.400
I call for a vote.

1192
01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:13.040
- [murmuring]
- [playing guitar]

1193
01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:16.600
I vote for Ammand the corsair.

1194
01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:19.200
Capitaine Chevalle,
the penniless Frenchman.

1195
01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:22.240
Sri Sumbhajee
votes for Sri Sumbhajee.

1196
01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:25.080
Mistress Ching.

1197
01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:26.560
Gentleman Jocard.

1198
01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:29.840
- Elizabeth Swann.
- Barbossa.

1199
01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:31.680
Vallenueva!

1200
01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:33.840
Elizabeth Swann.

1201
01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:36.800
- What?
- I know. Curious, isn't it?

1202
01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:41.000
Vote for me. Vote for me.

1203
01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:44.880
What you talking about?

1204
01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:46.040
No!

1205
01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:49.720
Am I to understand that you lot
will not be keeping to the code, then?

1206
01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:52.000
[string breaks]

1207
01:46:58.600 --> 01:46:59.800
Very well.

1208
01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:08.200
What say you, Captain Swann,
king of the Brethren Court?

1209
01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:12.480
Prepare every vessel that floats.

1210
01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:14.480
At dawn...

1211
01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:17.240
...we're at war.

1212
01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:24.640
[high-pitched]
And so we shall go to war.

1213
01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:27.880
[all shouting]

1214
01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:39.360
What?

1215
01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:43.080
You've seen it all,
done it all. You survived.

1216
01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:46.480
That's the trick, isn't it?
To survive?

1217
01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:50.520
It's not just about
living forever, Jackie.

1218
01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:58.560
The trick is
living with yourself forever.

1219
01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:03.760
How's Mum?

1220
01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:12.240
She looks great.

1221
01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:37.280
The enemy is here! Let's take them!

1222
01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:39.560
[shouting]

1223
01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:52.000
[shouting stops]

1224
01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:03.120
[parrot] Abandon ship. Abandon ship.

1225
01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:13.240
Parley?

1226
01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:13.680
You be the cur that led
these wolves to our door.

1227
01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:17.920
Don't blame Turner.
He was merely the tool of your betrayal.

1228
01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:22.560
If you wish to see its grand architect,
look to your left.

1229
01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:27.640
My hands are clean in this.

1230
01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:29.840
Figuratively.

1231
01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:32.840
My actions were my own
and to my own purpose.

1232
01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:36.360
- Jack had nothing to do with it.
- Well spoke. Listen to the tool.

1233
01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:38.400
Will, I've been aboard the Dutchman.

1234
01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:42.640
I understand the burden you bear,
but I fear that cause is lost.

1235
01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:47.360
No cause is lost if there is
but one fool left to fight for it.

1236
01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:54.480
If Turner wasn't acting on your behalf,
then how did he come to give me this?

1237
01:50:55.680 --> 01:51:00.680
You made a deal with me, Jack, to
deliver the pirates. And here they are.

1238
01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:04.800
Don't be bashful. Step up.
Claim your reward.

1239
01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:08.800
[Jones] Your debt to me
is still to be satisfied.

1240
01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:13.800
One hundred years in servitude
aboard the Dutchman. As a start.

1241
01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:17.720
That debt was paid, mate.
With some help.

1242
01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:20.200
- [Jones] You escaped.
- Technically.

1243
01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:22.320
I propose an exchange.

1244
01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:26.280
Will leaves with us...

1245
01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:28.760
...and you can take Jack.

1246
01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:31.880
Done.

1247
01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:34.240
- Undone.
- Done.

1248
01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:37.840
Jack's one of the nine pirate lords.
You have no right.

1249
01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:39.360
King.

1250
01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:45.960
- As you command, your nibs.
- Blackguard!

1251
01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:54.840
If ye have something to say,
I might be saying something as well.

1252
01:51:57.520 --> 01:51:59.560
First to the finish, then?

1253
01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:23.400
Do you fear death?

1254
01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:26.720
You've no idea.

1255
01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:31.560
Advise your Brethren,

1256
01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:34.720
you can fight, and all of you will die.

1257
01:52:34.760 --> 01:52:39.320
Or you can not fight,
in which case only most of you will die.

1258
01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:41.960
You murdered my father.

1259
01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:45.360
He chose his own fate.

1260
01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.720
And you have chosen yours.

1261
01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:50.880
We will fight.

1262
01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:53.240
And you will die.

1263
01:52:58.080 --> 01:52:59.680
So be it.

1264
01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:07.080
[Will] King?

1265
01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:09.960
Of the Brethren Court.
Courtesy of Jack.

1266
01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:12.800
Maybe he really
does know what he's doing.

1267
01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:20.280
Bravo!

1268
01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:25.480
You've successfully arrived aboard
the Dutchman as per the overall scheme.

1269
01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:27.280
- Look
- Oh, yes. Chapeau, mate.

1270
01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:30.440
Except for this sojourn in the brig,
it's utter clockwork.

1271
01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:32.880
Go away.

1272
01:53:32.960 --> 01:53:36.120
- What, back to the Locker?
- Not without you, Jackie.

1273
01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:38.040
Stab the heart.

1274
01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:49.040
Live forever as captain
of the Flying Dutchman.

1275
01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:54.480
Then again...

1276
01:53:55.280 --> 01:53:56.960
...if you're in the brig...

1277
01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:00.480
...who's to stab the heart?

1278
01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:05.840
Does seem to put immortality
a bit out of reach.

1279
01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:09.280
Peanut.

1280
01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:12.720
We'll need to use the Black Pearl
as a flagship to lead the attack.

1281
01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:17.000
- Oh, will we now?
- All right, Mrs. Fish. Come on.

1282
01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:21.000
Barbossa, you can't release her.

1283
01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:23.000
We need to give Jack a chance.

1284
01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:28.480
Apologies, Your Majesty. Too long
my fate has not been in me own hands.

1285
01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:32.680
No longer.

1286
01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:36.400
The enemy...

1287
01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:39.880
...has opted for oblivion.

1288
01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:44.680
Ready the fleet.

1289
01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:47.640
- To your stations.
- [man] To your stations.

1290
01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:57.280
Be there some manner
of rite or incantation?

1291
01:54:57.360 --> 01:54:58.600
Aye.

1292
01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:02.320
The items brought together, done.

1293
01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:04.800
Items to be burned...

1294
01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:07.600
...and someone must speak the words:

1295
01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:11.200
"Calypso, I release you
from your human bonds."

1296
01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:12.240
Is that it?

1297
01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:16.880
'Tis said it must be spoken
as if to a lover.

1298
01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:18.680
[all] Ooh!

1299
01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:28.040
Calypso, I release you
from your human bonds!

1300
01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:41.680
- Is that it?
- No, no, no. He didn't say it right.

1301
01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:47.680
He didn't...

1302
01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:50.000
You have to say it right.

1303
01:55:58.600 --> 01:55:59.600
Calypso...

1304
01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:07.440
...I release you from your human bonds.

1305
01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:27.680
Tia Dalma.

1306
01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:31.440
Calypso.

1307
01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:38.120
When the Brethren Court imprisoned you,
who was it that told them how?

1308
01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:44.480
- Who was it that betrayed you?
- Name him.

1309
01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:47.480
Davy Jones.

1310
01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:05.320
This is it! This is it!

1311
01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:10.520
[rope chafing]

1312
01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:25.640
[snapping]

1313
01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:49.680
Calypso!

1314
01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:57.040
I come before you as but a servant,
humble and contrite.

1315
01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:03.840
I have fulfilled me vow
and now ask your favor.

1316
01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:09.880
Spare meself, me ship, me crew...

1317
01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:14.720
...but unleash your fury upon those who
dare pretend themselves your masters...

1318
01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:16.400
...or mine.

1319
01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:27.320
[yelling indistinct incantation]

1320
01:59:04.200 --> 01:59:06.200
[wincing]

1321
01:59:14.320 --> 01:59:15.600
Is that it?

1322
01:59:18.320 --> 01:59:20.320
Why, she's no help at all.

1323
01:59:24.040 --> 01:59:25.320
What now?

1324
01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:27.520
Nothing.

1325
01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:31.280
Our final hope has failed us.

1326
01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:34.920
[wind gusting]

1327
01:59:58.720 --> 02:00:01.720
- It's not over.
- There's still a fight to be had.

1328
02:00:01.800 --> 02:00:05.720
We've an armada against us, and
with the Dutchman, there's no chance.

1329
02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:08.080
There's only a fool's chance.

1330
02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:10.920
Revenge won't bring
your father back, Miss Swann,

1331
02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:14.240
and it's not something
I'm intending to die for.

1332
02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:20.720
You're right.

1333
02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:28.080
Then what shall we die for?

1334
02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:33.200
You will listen to me.

1335
02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:35.200
Listen!

1336
02:00:38.120 --> 02:00:43.200
The Brethren will still be looking here
to us, to the Black Pearl, to lead.

1337
02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:45.200
And what will they see?

1338
02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:49.040
Frightened bilge rats
aboard a derelict ship? No.

1339
02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:53.360
No, they will see free men and freedom!

1340
02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:56.840
And what the enemy will see
is the flash of our cannons.

1341
02:00:56.880 --> 02:01:02.160
They will hear the ring of our swords,
and they will know what we can do.

1342
02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:07.160
By the sweat of our brows,

1343
02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:09.560
and the strength of our backs...

1344
02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:12.960
...and the courage of our hearts.

1345
02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:17.160
Gentlemen...

1346
02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:21.320
...hoist the colors.

1347
02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:24.800
Hoist the colors.

1348
02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:27.160
- Hoist the colors.
- Hoist the colors!

1349
02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:29.280
Aye.

1350
02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:33.040
The wind's on our side, boys.
That's all we need!

1351
02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:34.920
[shouting]

1352
02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.080
Hoist the colors!

1353
02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:40.080
[shouting in Chinese]

1354
02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:30.360
We have a favorable wind, sir.

1355
02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:32.320
Oh, so we do.

1356
02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:35.920
Signal Jones to give no quarter.

1357
02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:39.000
That should brighten his day.

1358
02:02:42.960 --> 02:02:46.880
To arms! We give no quarter!

1359
02:02:56.120 --> 02:02:57.920
Calypso.

1360
02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:01.160
- [thunder rumbling]
- [screeching]

1361
02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:27.480
Have you noticed,
on top of everything, it's raining?

1362
02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:28.640
That's a bad sign.

1363
02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:33.640
Man the capstan. Raise the main topyard.
Keep that powder dry.

1364
02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:36.400
[thunderclap]

1365
02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:50.080
Maelstrom!

1366
02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:55.320
[Elizabeth] Captain Barbossa!

1367
02:03:56.240 --> 02:03:58.280
We need you at the helm.

1368
02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:03.160
Aye, that be true.

1369
02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:10.400
Brace up yards,
you cack-handed deck apes.

1370
02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:14.600
Dying is the day worth living for.

1371
02:04:24.880 --> 02:04:26.520
Veer off!

1372
02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:28.840
She'll not harm us.

1373
02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:31.680
Full-bore and into the abyss.

1374
02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:33.720
Are you mad?

1375
02:04:33.760 --> 02:04:36.760
Ha! You afraid to get wet?

1376
02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:48.640
She's on our stern and gaining.

1377
02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:54.280
More speed!
Haul your wind and hold your water.

1378
02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:03.680
Bow cannons!

1379
02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:06.640
[man] Blow the cannons!

1380
02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:20.440
Take us out or they'll overbear us.

1381
02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:25.400
Nay. Further in.
We'll cut across to faster waters.

1382
02:05:26.600 --> 02:05:28.720
Prepare to broadside.

1383
02:05:39.160 --> 02:05:41.440
Captain the guns. Bear a hand.

1384
02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:45.360
Muster your courage, men.
At the ready.

1385
02:05:52.520 --> 02:05:56.080
Think like the whelp. Think like
the whelp. Think like the whelp.

1386
02:05:56.200 --> 02:05:58.360
Hinges. Hinges.

1387
02:05:58.440 --> 02:05:59.720
Think like the whelp.

1388
02:05:59.800 --> 02:06:01.240
Half-barrel hinges.

1389
02:06:01.360 --> 02:06:02.640
Leverage.

1390
02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:09.880
Wish us luck, boys. We'll need it.

1391
02:06:11.320 --> 02:06:14.160
- I miss him already.
- He is quite charming, isn't he?

1392
02:06:14.200 --> 02:06:15.800
Nobody move.

1393
02:06:16.880 --> 02:06:18.640
I dropped me brain.

1394
02:06:21.640 --> 02:06:23.640
[thunderclap]

1395
02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:31.280
Batten down the hatches!

1396
02:06:32.560 --> 02:06:34.600
Stand to your guns.

1397
02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:37.680
Midship cannoneers, sight the masts.

1398
02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:44.360
Main battery at the ready!

1399
02:06:48.920 --> 02:06:53.200
Hold there!
Wait till we're board-and-board.

1400
02:06:57.760 --> 02:06:59.520
Fire!

1401
02:06:59.880 --> 02:07:04.200
- Fire!
- Fire! Fire all!

1402
02:07:05.120 --> 02:07:06.280
Fire!

1403
02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:11.760
Fire!

1404
02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:22.760
Come on, men.

1405
02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:37.440
It be too late
to alter course now, mateys.

1406
02:07:41.800 --> 02:07:44.040
Halt there or we'll shoot.

1407
02:07:45.560 --> 02:07:46.680
Good one.

1408
02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:51.160
I just come to get me effects.

1409
02:07:52.800 --> 02:07:56.960
Admirable though it may be, why are
you here when you could be elsewhere?

1410
02:07:57.040 --> 02:07:59.320
Someone has to stay
and guard the chest.

1411
02:08:00.800 --> 02:08:05.360
There's no question, there's a breakdown
in military discipline on this vessel.

1412
02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:07.120
I blame the fish people.

1413
02:08:07.160 --> 02:08:11.520
Oh, so fish people,
by dint of being fish people,

1414
02:08:11.600 --> 02:08:14.840
automatically aren't
as disciplined as non-fish people?

1415
02:08:14.920 --> 02:08:17.280
Seems contributory,
is all I'm suggesting.

1416
02:08:17.320 --> 02:08:22.240
It's true, if there were no fish people,
there'd be no need to guard the chest.

1417
02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:25.760
And if there were no chest
we wouldn't need to be here to guard it.

1418
02:08:28.720 --> 02:08:31.720
[men shouting]

1419
02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:35.360
Prepare to board!

1420
02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:38.160
Cover!

1421
02:08:42.520 --> 02:08:45.040
- [groaning]
- [grunts]

1422
02:08:54.840 --> 02:08:56.520
No!

1423
02:09:03.880 --> 02:09:05.840
[chuckles]

1424
02:09:21.240 --> 02:09:22.400
[Jones chuckles]

1425
02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:27.440
Lookee here, boys. A lost bird.

1426
02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:31.400
A lost bird that never learned to fly.

1427
02:09:32.720 --> 02:09:34.480
To my great regret.

1428
02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:36.920
But...

1429
02:09:39.680 --> 02:09:41.680
...never too late to learn, eh?

1430
02:09:47.240 --> 02:09:49.760
[screaming]

1431
02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:51.280
Whoa!

1432
02:09:57.920 --> 02:10:01.280
The chest, hand it over.

1433
02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:03.200
I can set you free, mate.

1434
02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:06.280
My freedom was forfeit long ago.

1435
02:10:53.320 --> 02:10:54.640
Elizabeth.

1436
02:10:58.440 --> 02:10:59.640
Elizabeth.

1437
02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:02.080
Will you marry me?

1438
02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:05.720
I don't think now's the best time.

1439
02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:11.600
Now may be the only time.

1440
02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:18.000
I love you.

1441
02:11:23.920 --> 02:11:26.480
I've made my choice. What's yours?

1442
02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:28.600
Barbossa.

1443
02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:31.520
Marry us.

1444
02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:35.280
I'm a little busy at the moment.

1445
02:11:41.480 --> 02:11:43.480
Barbossa, now.

1446
02:11:45.160 --> 02:11:46.480
Fine, then.

1447
02:11:57.360 --> 02:12:00.520
Dearly beloved,
we be gathered here today...

1448
02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:04.720
To nail your gizzards
to the mast, you poxy cur.

1449
02:12:09.600 --> 02:12:12.640
Elizabeth Swann,
do you take me to be your husband?

1450
02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:14.680
- I do.
- Great.

1451
02:12:21.160 --> 02:12:23.400
Will Turner, do you take me...

1452
02:12:24.720 --> 02:12:26.400
...to be your wife...

1453
02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:32.800
...in sickness and in health...

1454
02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:35.920
...with health being the less likely?

1455
02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:44.400
I do.

1456
02:12:46.640 --> 02:12:49.560
As captain, I now pronounce you...

1457
02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:54.360
You may kiss...

1458
02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:55.800
[cackles]

1459
02:13:03.240 --> 02:13:04.640
You may kiss...

1460
02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:11.280
Just kiss.

1461
02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:33.680
[monkey screeches]

1462
02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:51.680
Leave it.

1463
02:14:03.920 --> 02:14:06.600
You can do nothing without the key.

1464
02:14:06.680 --> 02:14:08.120
I already have the key.

1465
02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:10.840
No, you don't.

1466
02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:13.640
Oh, that key.

1467
02:14:49.720 --> 02:14:50.720
No!

1468
02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:20.240
Oi. My pistol.

1469
02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:29.080
[screams]

1470
02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:49.360
Turner.

1471
02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:55.360
Fire!

1472
02:15:58.360 --> 02:16:01.240
[muffled grunting]

1473
02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:02.880
Thank you, Jack.

1474
02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:34.240
Stop! It's me.

1475
02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:39.680
It's Will. Your son.

1476
02:17:08.440 --> 02:17:09.800
Ha!

1477
02:17:25.440 --> 02:17:27.360
[screams]

1478
02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:38.720
- [thud]
- [both grunt]

1479
02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:42.240
Go!

1480
02:18:00.640 --> 02:18:04.760
Harridan! You'll see no mercy from me.

1481
02:18:04.800 --> 02:18:07.120
That's why I brought this.

1482
02:18:21.440 --> 02:18:22.960
[Elizabeth grunting]

1483
02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:29.760
I'm not going to kill you.
I made you a promise.

1484
02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:38.320
[yells]

1485
02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:39.760
Missed.

1486
02:18:40.960 --> 02:18:45.800
Did you forget?
I'm a heartless wretch.

1487
02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:05.640
Ah. Love.

1488
02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:09.520
A dreadful bond.

1489
02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:15.320
And yet, so easily severed.

1490
02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:20.560
Tell me, William Turner,
do you fear death?

1491
02:19:20.640 --> 02:19:22.080
[Jack] Do you?

1492
02:19:24.480 --> 02:19:26.840
[heart beating]

1493
02:19:32.840 --> 02:19:36.520
Heady tonic, holding life and death
in the palm of one's hand.

1494
02:19:37.120 --> 02:19:41.520
You're a cruel man, Jack Sparrow.

1495
02:19:42.400 --> 02:19:44.840
Cruel is a matter of perspective.

1496
02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:46.960
Is it?

1497
02:19:49.040 --> 02:19:50.840
- [groans]
- [gasps]

1498
02:20:12.720 --> 02:20:13.880
Will?

1499
02:20:15.440 --> 02:20:18.040
Look at me! Stay with me!
You're all right.

1500
02:20:23.920 --> 02:20:25.600
William?

1501
02:20:26.040 --> 02:20:27.720
My son.

1502
02:20:39.600 --> 02:20:43.120
Will? Will?
Look at me. Look at me!

1503
02:20:46.840 --> 02:20:50.760
You will not forestall my judgment.

1504
02:21:03.440 --> 02:21:05.080
[gasping]

1505
02:21:06.520 --> 02:21:08.160
Calypso.

1506
02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:19.480
She's taking us down! Make quick
or it's the Locker for us all!

1507
02:21:50.480 --> 02:21:51.520
No.

1508
02:21:55.640 --> 02:21:57.160
No, no.

1509
02:21:57.200 --> 02:21:58.960
No!

1510
02:22:00.200 --> 02:22:04.480
[all] Part of the crew.
Part of the ship, part of the crew.

1511
02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:08.080
Part of the ship, part of the crew.

1512
02:22:08.160 --> 02:22:10.160
Don't leave me.

1513
02:22:11.480 --> 02:22:13.160
Don't. No!

1514
02:22:13.240 --> 02:22:15.120
I won't leave you.

1515
02:22:25.200 --> 02:22:27.440
The Dutchman must have a captain.

1516
02:22:30.760 --> 02:22:31.760
Hold on.

1517
02:23:26.480 --> 02:23:28.160
Thank goodness, Jack.

1518
02:23:28.240 --> 02:23:32.200
The armada's still out there. The
Endeavor's coming up hard to starboard,

1519
02:23:32.240 --> 02:23:36.360
and I think it's time we embrace that
oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.

1520
02:23:36.400 --> 02:23:39.080
Never actually been one for tradition.

1521
02:23:44.040 --> 02:23:47.080
Close haul her.
Luff the sails and lay her in irons.

1522
02:23:47.120 --> 02:23:49.440
Belay that,
or we'll be a sitting duck.

1523
02:23:49.480 --> 02:23:50.800
Belay that "belay that."

1524
02:23:50.880 --> 02:23:52.640
- But the arma...
- Belay.

1525
02:23:52.760 --> 02:23:55.000
- The Endeav...
- Stow. Shut it.

1526
02:24:08.120 --> 02:24:10.120
What are they waiting for?

1527
02:24:11.120 --> 02:24:14.080
He expects us to honor our agreement.

1528
02:24:16.240 --> 02:24:19.080
[man] Ready guns and gun ports.

1529
02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:27.720
It's nothing personal, Jack.
It's just good business.

1530
02:24:54.560 --> 02:24:57.080
Ah, she survived.

1531
02:25:01.880 --> 02:25:04.200
[grunting and moaning]

1532
02:25:22.200 --> 02:25:25.560
- Ready on the guns.
- [all] Guns ready.

1533
02:25:26.200 --> 02:25:28.360
Full canvas.

1534
02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:30.800
Aye, full canvas.

1535
02:25:55.360 --> 02:25:56.640
Orders, sir.

1536
02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:01.240
Sir!

1537
02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:02.880
Cap'n.

1538
02:26:03.320 --> 02:26:05.920
- Fire.
- Fire!

1539
02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.080
- Fire!
- Fire!

1540
02:26:08.160 --> 02:26:10.120
Fire, all!

1541
02:26:20.720 --> 02:26:23.600
Orders? Orders, sir?

1542
02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:37.440
Sir, what do you command?

1543
02:26:38.080 --> 02:26:39.440
It's just...

1544
02:26:41.520 --> 02:26:43.240
...good business.

1545
02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:46.280
Abandon ship!

1546
02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:50.360
- Abandon ship!
- All hands, abandon ship!

1547
02:27:29.480 --> 02:27:32.320
- [glass shatters]
- [explosions]

1548
02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:17.840
They're turning away!

1549
02:28:17.920 --> 02:28:20.920
[shouting]

1550
02:28:30.200 --> 02:28:32.040
[squawks] Wind in your sails.

1551
02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:39.360
Shiver me timbers.

1552
02:28:48.800 --> 02:28:51.600
[shouting, cheering]

1553
02:29:00.360 --> 02:29:02.400
Captain Turner!

1554
02:29:17.080 --> 02:29:19.160
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Cap'n?

1555
02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:23.400
- You may throw my hat if you like.
- Aye, aye, cap'n.

1556
02:29:23.440 --> 02:29:25.120
Hooray!

1557
02:29:27.400 --> 02:29:29.120
Now go and get it.

1558
02:29:47.560 --> 02:29:49.160
Orders, sir?

1559
02:29:53.440 --> 02:29:57.440
You're no longer bound
to the Dutchman. You're free.

1560
02:29:57.560 --> 02:29:59.560
Aye.

1561
02:29:59.640 --> 02:30:02.000
That's a fine thing, but...

1562
02:30:03.640 --> 02:30:08.320
...by my reckoning,
I still have a debt that has to be paid.

1563
02:30:08.400 --> 02:30:09.960
If you'll have me.

1564
02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:15.880
On the wheel, then, Mr. Turner.

1565
02:30:17.280 --> 02:30:19.280
Aye, Captain Turner.

1566
02:30:34.200 --> 02:30:36.880
[Bootstrap Bill] This ship
has a purpose again.

1567
02:30:36.960 --> 02:30:39.000
And where we are bound...

1568
02:30:39.680 --> 02:30:42.120
...she cannot come.

1569
02:30:42.160 --> 02:30:44.160
One day ashore.

1570
02:30:44.200 --> 02:30:46.360
Ten years at sea.

1571
02:30:47.280 --> 02:30:50.120
That's a steep price
for what's been done.

1572
02:30:52.320 --> 02:30:54.320
Depends on the one day.

1573
02:30:57.040 --> 02:30:59.640
Your chariot awaits, Your Highness.

1574
02:31:03.440 --> 02:31:05.440
The oars are inside.

1575
02:31:17.040 --> 02:31:19.040
Mrs. Turner.

1576
02:31:23.920 --> 02:31:25.520
Goodbye, poppet.

1577
02:31:31.320 --> 02:31:32.600
Jack.

1578
02:31:33.840 --> 02:31:36.400
It would never
have worked out between us.

1579
02:31:39.720 --> 02:31:42.200
Keep telling yourself that, darling.

1580
02:31:45.600 --> 02:31:47.480
Once was quite enough.

1581
02:31:49.920 --> 02:31:51.920
Thank you.

1582
02:32:11.200 --> 02:32:13.200
I'm going to need the other one.

1583
02:32:45.200 --> 02:32:47.200
It's nearly sunset.

1584
02:33:03.640 --> 02:33:05.640
[heart beating]

1585
02:33:06.360 --> 02:33:08.080
It's always belonged to you.

1586
02:33:13.840 --> 02:33:15.400
Will you keep it safe?

1587
02:33:17.200 --> 02:33:18.360
Yes.

1588
02:33:22.360 --> 02:33:23.520
Yes.

1589
02:33:43.400 --> 02:33:44.400
Will!

1590
02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.160
Keep a weather eye on the horizon.

1591
02:34:31.040 --> 02:34:34.320
Granted it tends to list to port,
and has been, on occasion,

1592
02:34:34.400 --> 02:34:36.600
known to frighten young women.

1593
02:34:36.680 --> 02:34:41.080
But I promise you,
you will not be disappointed.

1594
02:34:41.760 --> 02:34:42.920
Is that it?

1595
02:34:43.480 --> 02:34:45.040
The Black Pearl?

1596
02:34:45.680 --> 02:34:47.760
It's not very big.

1597
02:34:47.840 --> 02:34:50.240
Love, that is a dinghy.

1598
02:34:50.280 --> 02:34:55.680
My vessel is magnificent
and fierce and huge-ish and...

1599
02:34:56.120 --> 02:34:59.280
...gone. Why is it gone?

1600
02:35:00.240 --> 02:35:01.800
Is that it there?

1601
02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:04.160
Yes, there it is.

1602
02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:06.400
Why is it there?

1603
02:35:07.760 --> 02:35:09.320
It's much larger up close.

1604
02:35:09.400 --> 02:35:11.760
[sighs] Jack, you promised
to take us for a ride.

1605
02:35:11.800 --> 02:35:15.760
- I was to be given the first ride.
- What? You?

1606
02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:18.440
- Not what he said.
- [gasps] I never!

1607
02:35:20.240 --> 02:35:24.360
Mr. Gibbs? Any particular reason
why my ship is gone?

1608
02:35:24.440 --> 02:35:27.280
The ship? We're on the ship.

1609
02:35:29.920 --> 02:35:32.800
Jack! The ship's gone!

1610
02:35:32.840 --> 02:35:33.920
Really?

1611
02:35:35.960 --> 02:35:39.200
Ladies! Will you please shut it?

1612
02:35:39.280 --> 02:35:42.640
Listen to me.
Yes, I lied to you.

1613
02:35:42.720 --> 02:35:44.240
No, I don't love you.

1614
02:35:44.320 --> 02:35:47.400
Of course it makes you look fat.
I've never been to Brussels.

1615
02:35:47.480 --> 02:35:50.200
It is pronounced "egregious."

1616
02:35:50.280 --> 02:35:54.320
By the way, no, I've never actually
met Pizarro, but I love his pies.

1617
02:35:54.360 --> 02:35:57.080
And all of this pales
to utter insignificance

1618
02:35:57.160 --> 02:36:00.880
in light of the fact that
my ship is once again gone. Savvy?

1619
02:36:13.440 --> 02:36:16.320
- Take what you can.
- Give nothing back.

1620
02:36:20.240 --> 02:36:24.320
Tell me, ladies,
what do you know of sea turtles?

1621
02:36:24.360 --> 02:36:25.480
Sea turtles?

1622
02:36:25.720 --> 02:36:27.960
Let me tell you
the amazing story of Cap...

1623
02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.680
[Barbossa] All men up the ratlines.

1624
02:36:31.120 --> 02:36:33.880
All men up the ratlines!

1625
02:36:39.040 --> 02:36:41.280
Oh, you want a taste of this?

1626
02:36:42.800 --> 02:36:46.000
Oh, that's a good boy!
You're Daddy's boy.

1627
02:36:46.040 --> 02:36:48.720
Oh, yes, you are.
Oh, yes, you are.

1628
02:36:48.760 --> 02:36:49.760
Sir?

1629
02:36:51.120 --> 02:36:53.680
Some of the men don't feel
entirely settled

1630
02:36:53.720 --> 02:36:56.200
- about leaving Captain Jack behind.
- Again.

1631
02:36:56.400 --> 02:36:59.240
- Again.
- Is that so?

1632
02:36:59.560 --> 02:37:03.200
It would make us feel a whole lot
better regarding our fortunes

1633
02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:05.960
if we could see that item
you told us about.

1634
02:37:06.040 --> 02:37:08.240
- On the charts.
- Aye.

1635
02:37:08.320 --> 02:37:09.720
With our own eyes.

1636
02:37:09.760 --> 02:37:13.400
To help put an ease
to our burden of guilt, so to speak.

1637
02:37:13.800 --> 02:37:15.640
Ah.

1638
02:37:15.720 --> 02:37:17.920
Feast your eyes upon this, mateys.

1639
02:37:18.360 --> 02:37:20.920
There's more than one way
to live forever.

1640
02:37:20.960 --> 02:37:24.720
Gents, I give you
the Fountain of Youth.

1641
02:37:35.440 --> 02:37:37.320
