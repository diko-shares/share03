1
00:01:04,987 --> 00:01:07,573
- Upstairs!
- What's going on?

2
00:01:07,698 --> 00:01:08,740
Who are you?

3
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:12,870
Dade! Dade!

4
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:14,913
Knock it down.

5
00:01:16,874 --> 00:01:19,209
The defendant, Dade Murphy,

6
00:01:19,543 --> 00:01:23,172
who calls himself 'Zero Cool',

7
00:01:23,297 --> 00:01:28,177
has repeatedly committed criminal acts
of a malicious nature.

8
00:01:28,302 --> 00:01:32,723
This defendant possesses
a superior intelligence,

9
00:01:32,848 --> 00:01:37,311
which he uses to a destructive
and antisocial end.

10
00:01:38,771 --> 00:01:46,771
His computer virus crashed 1507 systems,
including Wall Street trading systems,

11
00:01:46,987 --> 00:01:52,075
single-handedly causing a seven-point
drop in the New York stock market.

12
00:01:52,785 --> 00:01:57,539
Dade Murphy, I hereby fine
your family $45,000.

13
00:01:58,499 --> 00:02:02,920
I sentence you to probation.
You are forbidden to use a computer

14
00:02:03,045 --> 00:02:07,216
or a touchtone telephone until
the day of your 18th birthday.

15
00:04:38,742 --> 00:04:41,370
- Dade?
- Yeah, Mom?

16
00:04:41,578 --> 00:04:43,122
What are you doing?

17
00:04:45,124 --> 00:04:47,709
Taking over a TV network.

18
00:04:48,252 --> 00:04:52,422
Finish up, honey. Go to sleep.
And happy birthday.

19
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,265
Security, Norm...

20
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,390
Norman speaking.

21
00:05:02,474 --> 00:05:05,644
Norman. This is Mr Eddie Vedder
from Accounting.

22
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:09,773
I had a power surge here at home
that wiped out a file I was working on.

23
00:05:10,732 --> 00:05:13,652
I'm in big trouble.
You know anything about computers?

24
00:05:15,195 --> 00:05:16,363
Gee...

25
00:05:16,488 --> 00:05:21,160
My BLT drive on my computer
just went AWOL,

26
00:05:21,285 --> 00:05:25,622
and I have this big project
due tomorrow for Mr Kawasaki.

27
00:05:25,747 --> 00:05:27,958
If I screw up, he'll make me
commit Hari-kari.

28
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,172
You know these Japanese
management techniques.

29
00:05:34,173 --> 00:05:36,675
Could you read me
the number on the modem?

30
00:05:38,594 --> 00:05:41,096
It's a little boxy thing
with switches on it.

31
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:43,182
It lets my computer
talk to the one there.

32
00:05:43,307 --> 00:05:44,307
212...

33
00:05:44,308 --> 00:05:48,854
5554240.

34
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:17,216
So-called American Indians, Latinos,
and blacks are genetically mediocre.

35
00:06:17,341 --> 00:06:19,134
Yak, yak, yak.

36
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:21,303
Get a job.

37
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:57,840
You are about to experience
the awe and mystery

38
00:06:57,965 --> 00:06:59,466
which reaches from
the inner mind

39
00:06:59,591 --> 00:07:02,928
to... The Outer Limits.

40
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:15,649
Zero...

41
00:07:17,109 --> 00:07:18,109
No, wait.

42
00:07:30,581 --> 00:07:31,290
Unbelievable.

43
00:07:31,498 --> 00:07:33,000
A hacker.

44
00:07:39,548 --> 00:07:43,051
Yeah, okay, Acid Burn. That's enough.

45
00:08:29,223 --> 00:08:31,350
Shit on me!

46
00:08:37,022 --> 00:08:40,317
Good morning.
Did you unpack your stuff yet?

47
00:08:42,444 --> 00:08:44,196
Up all night again?

48
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:47,407
Can this wait until both
of my eyes are open?

49
00:08:50,494 --> 00:08:54,289
Can I cut the electricity to his room
so he'll get some sleep?

50
00:08:54,414 --> 00:08:58,085
He's been playing with his computer
all night for a week.

51
00:08:58,877 --> 00:09:00,879
Yes, he could be playing with himself.

52
00:09:02,464 --> 00:09:04,925
Yes, I’ll ask. Dade,

53
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,469
you like girls, don't you?

54
00:09:07,594 --> 00:09:10,639
Yeah. I just haven't found one
as charming as you.

55
00:09:12,641 --> 00:09:14,476
You haven't done anything stupid, right?

56
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:17,104
Right, Dade?

57
00:09:17,271 --> 00:09:18,397
Right, Mom.

58
00:09:18,772 --> 00:09:20,441
And I’m still a virgin.

59
00:09:36,123 --> 00:09:38,667
You hooked it up to the phone,
didn't you?

60
00:09:39,126 --> 00:09:42,129
Dade, turn the shower off!

61
00:09:44,381 --> 00:09:47,718
You screw up again
and you won't get into college.

62
00:10:00,564 --> 00:10:03,025
I'm sorry we had to move
in your senior year.

63
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,945
I didn't want to sell the house
but I had to take this job. You know that.

64
00:10:08,447 --> 00:10:11,033
You'll love New York.
It's the city that never sleeps.

65
00:10:48,737 --> 00:10:52,407
I miss you, too, baby.
Claro que sí.

66
00:10:53,617 --> 00:10:55,119
Excuse me.

67
00:10:55,619 --> 00:10:57,538
Chill, man. I’m talking to Venezuela.

68
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,040
I'm sorry. Where's the principal's office?

69
00:11:00,165 --> 00:11:01,583
I can't help you, kid.

70
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,558
Do you have your transfer forms?

71
00:11:19,977 --> 00:11:22,604
It's a straightforward question.

72
00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:29,945
Do you speak English?

73
00:11:30,195 --> 00:11:32,531
Sorry, you wanted...

74
00:11:32,656 --> 00:11:34,158
Transfer forms.

75
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:45,210
Are you coming?

76
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:01,560
The gym is through there
and the cafeteria is through there.

77
00:12:02,102 --> 00:12:04,146
Great. Cool.

78
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:09,151
What's your name?

79
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:11,570
Kate. Kate Libby.

80
00:12:12,362 --> 00:12:13,822
Here's your class.

81
00:12:14,156 --> 00:12:16,909
My class.
I'm not in your class?

82
00:12:17,701 --> 00:12:19,578
No, you're not in my class.

83
00:12:22,915 --> 00:12:24,416
Give me time.

84
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,084
- You new?
- Yeah.

85
00:12:26,835 --> 00:12:28,420
Tell him about the pool, Kate.

86
00:12:29,671 --> 00:12:30,671
Pool?

87
00:12:30,672 --> 00:12:34,343
There's an Olympic-size
swimming pool on the roof.

88
00:12:35,135 --> 00:12:36,929
Take the stairs over there.

89
00:12:37,971 --> 00:12:40,349
Yeah. Sure.

90
00:12:42,392 --> 00:12:43,769
Thanks.

91
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:49,817
Hey! Hold the door!

92
00:12:54,988 --> 00:12:56,073
No pool.

93
00:13:30,315 --> 00:13:32,568
Oh, my God. He found the pool.

94
00:13:37,072 --> 00:13:38,449
I'm Mr Simpson.

95
00:13:38,574 --> 00:13:42,619
I'm subbing for Ms Bayless,
who was arrested at the anti-fur rally.

96
00:13:45,372 --> 00:13:51,128
I know some of you kids got computers
at home, but these are school property.

97
00:13:57,301 --> 00:14:01,138
Chapter One.
'Designing Graphical Interface'.

98
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,022
What's your interest in Kate Libby?

99
00:14:10,147 --> 00:14:12,065
Academic, purely sexual?

100
00:14:12,274 --> 00:14:13,901
Homicidal.

101
00:14:14,568 --> 00:14:17,488
What's up, man? I’m the Phreak.

102
00:14:18,238 --> 00:14:21,200
The Fantom Phreak?
The King of Nynex?

103
00:14:23,452 --> 00:14:25,204
I know you play the game.

104
00:14:25,537 --> 00:14:27,998
Phreak, Phreak, Phreak.
Dude, dude, dude.

105
00:14:28,207 --> 00:14:31,794
Joey! One more 'dude'
and I’ll slap the shit out of you.

106
00:14:32,461 --> 00:14:36,590
You gotta stop letting your mama
dress you, man. You're hopeless!

107
00:14:38,258 --> 00:14:40,636
- Check it.
- I need a handle.

108
00:14:42,346 --> 00:14:44,723
I don't have an identity
until I have a handle.

109
00:14:44,848 --> 00:14:48,102
You're right about that.
Check it. Friday.

110
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,192
Wait. How about The Master of Disaster?

111
00:14:55,317 --> 00:14:57,528
You're utterly hopeless, man.

112
00:14:57,653 --> 00:15:00,072
Ultra Laser... Doctor Doom!

113
00:15:16,672 --> 00:15:19,550
Tell me what you need. Records?
Tapes? Any kind of format or disk.

114
00:15:19,675 --> 00:15:23,303
Check this out, each of you.
Compilation tapes of my own making.

115
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:25,431
I call this 'The Greatest Zukes Album',

116
00:15:25,556 --> 00:15:30,978
featuring Hendrix, Joplin,
Mama Cass, Belushi,

117
00:15:31,103 --> 00:15:35,357
all great artists who asphyxiated
on their own vomit!

118
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:38,068
You can't get this in stores!

119
00:15:48,912 --> 00:15:51,748
Please deposit $5
for the first minute.

120
00:15:54,042 --> 00:15:55,042
Thank you.

121
00:15:55,085 --> 00:15:56,503
No, thank you.

122
00:16:27,034 --> 00:16:29,453
That's a nice score for a girl.

123
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,874
Think you can do better?

124
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:37,044
I’ll give it a shot.

125
00:16:51,975 --> 00:16:54,019
Is this kid bothering you, Kate?

126
00:16:54,937 --> 00:16:56,897
Could I get some room here?

127
00:16:57,773 --> 00:16:59,525
Why don't you come up here?

128
00:17:38,063 --> 00:17:39,148
He's good!

129
00:17:49,867 --> 00:17:52,327
Well, it looks like I’m on top.

130
00:17:56,373 --> 00:17:59,793
Congratulations.
No-one's ever beat her before.

131
00:18:00,043 --> 00:18:01,920
You just made an enemy for life.

132
00:18:04,548 --> 00:18:06,884
Boy meets world. Let's go.

133
00:18:26,028 --> 00:18:28,113
- Who's that?
- Curtis.

134
00:18:29,656 --> 00:18:30,824
What's he do?

135
00:18:30,949 --> 00:18:33,827
You're looking at it.
He looks slick all day.

136
00:18:36,497 --> 00:18:37,497
Joey!

137
00:19:17,454 --> 00:19:18,789
What's up?

138
00:19:24,962 --> 00:19:28,090
Oh, my God! You...?

139
00:19:39,977 --> 00:19:41,603
Way cool!

140
00:19:43,272 --> 00:19:44,690
You saw that?

141
00:19:45,107 --> 00:19:46,483
What the hell is going on?

142
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,819
Pool on the roof must be leaking.

143
00:19:58,912 --> 00:20:00,956
Oh, man. This is going to be good.

144
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:11,425
'God gave men brains larger than dogs

145
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,511
so they wouldn't hump women's legs
at cocktail parties'.

146
00:20:15,137 --> 00:20:16,137
Ruth Libby.

147
00:20:17,765 --> 00:20:21,560
I'm not sure your mother qualifies
as a significant 20th century author.

148
00:20:21,685 --> 00:20:24,354
Her last book sold 2 million copies.

149
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:33,447
'Angelheaded hipsters burning for
the ancient heavenly connection

150
00:20:33,572 --> 00:20:37,409
'to the starry dynamo
in the machinery of the night'.

151
00:20:37,534 --> 00:20:38,660
Ginsberg.

152
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:42,206
Nice. Very nice.

153
00:20:44,082 --> 00:20:46,126
He's not in this class.

154
00:20:46,585 --> 00:20:47,795
I said give me time.

155
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:51,965
He's not enrolled in this class.

156
00:20:52,257 --> 00:20:54,218
Well, he's on my list.

157
00:21:07,106 --> 00:21:11,527
'Of all the things I’ve lost,
I miss my mind the most'.

158
00:21:11,777 --> 00:21:13,362
Ozzy Osbourne.

159
00:21:13,487 --> 00:21:16,115
You. What is your name?

160
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,784
Emmanuel Goldstein, sir.

161
00:21:19,535 --> 00:21:22,704
You, however, are not on my list.

162
00:21:23,997 --> 00:21:26,250
This isn't wood shop class?

163
00:21:31,171 --> 00:21:33,841
Class crashing. Come on.

164
00:21:33,966 --> 00:21:35,384
Now get out.

165
00:21:37,177 --> 00:21:38,887
Thank you, sir.

166
00:21:45,727 --> 00:21:47,187
How was school?

167
00:21:50,357 --> 00:21:52,693
- What did we learn in school today?
- Revenge.

168
00:21:52,818 --> 00:21:55,487
Ahh. Did we meet someone special?

169
00:21:55,904 --> 00:21:57,489
No. No-one special.

170
00:21:59,283 --> 00:22:03,454
I have to get back to work.
Would you please try to fill these out?

171
00:22:04,496 --> 00:22:05,496
Don't worry,

172
00:22:05,581 --> 00:22:07,541
it's only the rest of your life.

173
00:22:09,042 --> 00:22:12,796
Anything else?
Want me to mow the lawn?

174
00:22:12,921 --> 00:22:15,466
Oops, I forgot. New York, no grass.

175
00:22:16,341 --> 00:22:17,551
And unpack.

176
00:22:41,658 --> 00:22:45,204
You can sit at home
and do absolutely nothing

177
00:22:45,996 --> 00:22:48,415
and your name goes through
17 computers a day.

178
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,794
'1984'? Yeah, right. That's a typo.

179
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:57,091
Orwell's here and living large.
We have no names, man. No names!

180
00:22:58,175 --> 00:22:59,384
Can I score a fry?

181
00:23:00,469 --> 00:23:02,304
Meet Cereal Killer.

182
00:23:02,429 --> 00:23:03,931
As in Fruit Loops.

183
00:23:04,056 --> 00:23:05,891
But he does know things.

184
00:23:06,058 --> 00:23:07,893
Anyway, guys, listen.

185
00:23:08,727 --> 00:23:10,771
I'm in this computer, right?
I'm looking around...

186
00:23:10,896 --> 00:23:12,898
You got those Crayola books?

187
00:23:13,023 --> 00:23:14,900
Yeah, technicolour rainbow.

188
00:23:16,527 --> 00:23:17,319
Green one.

189
00:23:17,444 --> 00:23:19,530
What is that? Let me see?

190
00:23:19,655 --> 00:23:22,908
- What are these?
- International UNIX environments.

191
00:23:23,033 --> 00:23:24,701
Luscious orange.

192
00:23:24,827 --> 00:23:28,330
Computer security criteria...
DOD standards.

193
00:23:29,748 --> 00:23:32,292
The pink-shirt book... guide to IBM PCs.

194
00:23:32,417 --> 00:23:35,754
So-called due to the nasty pink shirt
the guy wears on the cover.

195
00:23:35,879 --> 00:23:37,673
Devil book, the UNIX bible.

196
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:40,384
- What's that?
- Dragon book, compiler design.

197
00:23:42,344 --> 00:23:44,221
- What's that?
- The Red book.

198
00:23:44,346 --> 00:23:46,723
NSA-trusted networks.

199
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:50,894
Otherwise known as 'The Ugly Red Book
That Won't Fit On A Shelf'.

200
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:55,357
Anyway, guys. Come on.
I'm in this computer, right.

201
00:23:55,983 --> 00:24:00,904
I'm looking around, throwing commands.
I don't know what it does or anything.

202
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:02,197
It's choice.

203
00:24:02,322 --> 00:24:06,243
It's beautiful. Four hours
just messing around in there.

204
00:24:06,368 --> 00:24:09,246
Finally, I figure out...

205
00:24:09,413 --> 00:24:11,039
that it's a bank.

206
00:24:11,582 --> 00:24:15,669
Okay, wait. It's a bank. So, this morning,
I check the paper,

207
00:24:15,794 --> 00:24:21,383
some cash machine in, like, Bumsville,
Idaho, spits out $700 into the street.

208
00:24:21,508 --> 00:24:23,218
- That's kinda cool.
- That was me.

209
00:24:23,343 --> 00:24:26,346
- I did that.
- You did this from your house?

210
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,475
Are you stoned or stupid?

211
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,604
You don't hack a bank from your house!
You get nailed by the FBI.

212
00:24:33,729 --> 00:24:35,105
Are your brains in your ass?

213
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,732
Don't you know anything?

214
00:24:36,857 --> 00:24:39,485
It's universally stupid, man.

215
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:43,113
I don't know things because you guys
won't tell me anything. Right?

216
00:24:43,238 --> 00:24:45,157
What are the three most used passwords?

217
00:24:45,282 --> 00:24:48,994
'Love', 'Secret' and 'Sex'.

218
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:51,872
But not in that order, necessarily. Right?

219
00:24:51,997 --> 00:24:56,919
Don't forget 'God'. System operators
love to use 'God'. Male ego.

220
00:24:57,211 --> 00:25:02,091
To be elite, you have to do a righteous
hack, not this accidental shit.

221
00:25:03,175 --> 00:25:06,970
Which means you score
one of those Gibsons, man.

222
00:25:07,096 --> 00:25:11,183
Those supercomputers they use
to do physics and look for oil.

223
00:25:11,308 --> 00:25:13,852
No way, man. Security is too tight.

224
00:25:14,895 --> 00:25:16,939
Maybe. But if I wanted to hack
some heavy metal,

225
00:25:17,064 --> 00:25:20,651
I’d work my way in
through some back door.

226
00:25:20,901 --> 00:25:26,115
Oh, man. Wouldn't you just love
to get one of those Gibsons?

227
00:25:27,032 --> 00:25:28,867
Who ate all of my fries?

228
00:25:30,494 --> 00:25:33,330
- Joey!
- No, I didn't touch your fries.

229
00:25:34,164 --> 00:25:37,084
- Cereal, man. You owe me a pack.
- Lt was him.

230
00:25:38,127 --> 00:25:39,927
- Lay off that shit, man.
- I’m gonna hit you!

231
00:26:40,314 --> 00:26:44,568
Yes! Home run, home run. Okay, okay.

232
00:26:46,236 --> 00:26:47,905
You and me, Lucy.

233
00:26:48,697 --> 00:26:50,491
We're gonna show them, baby.

234
00:26:50,991 --> 00:26:51,991
Ow!

235
00:27:23,607 --> 00:27:24,191
Mr Belford?

236
00:27:24,441 --> 00:27:27,736
My name is The Plague.

237
00:27:27,903 --> 00:27:31,365
Mr The Plague, something weird
is happening on the net.

238
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:34,159
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?

239
00:27:34,243 --> 00:27:37,663
One of the Gibsons is working really hard.

240
00:27:37,746 --> 00:27:41,333
We got one person on-line
but with the workload of 10 users.

241
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:42,835
I think we got a hacker.

242
00:27:47,881 --> 00:27:50,843
Okay, we need proof that we were here.

243
00:27:54,263 --> 00:27:56,598
Yeah. Garbage. Give me Garbage.

244
00:28:08,235 --> 00:28:09,903
Shit.

245
00:28:36,764 --> 00:28:38,015
Never fear,

246
00:28:39,016 --> 00:28:40,559
I is here.

247
00:28:41,685 --> 00:28:46,774
- I located the activity to terminal 23.
- Let's echo 23, see what's up.

248
00:29:03,207 --> 00:29:05,292
God wouldn't be up this late.

249
00:29:19,223 --> 00:29:20,223
Shit!

250
00:29:20,307 --> 00:29:24,728
Get me the switching control centre.
I need to trace this call.

251
00:29:31,568 --> 00:29:34,279
Hold on, Mom. Hold on one second.

252
00:29:35,197 --> 00:29:38,325
- Open the door, Joseph.
- Yeah, okay.

253
00:29:40,202 --> 00:29:41,286
There you go.

254
00:29:41,745 --> 00:29:43,705
Bed. Sleep.

255
00:29:45,374 --> 00:29:46,375
Now!

256
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,628
Sweet dreams, Joseph.

257
00:29:53,715 --> 00:29:54,715
He's gone.

258
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,301
Did you get a trace?

259
00:29:56,468 --> 00:29:57,928
Yeah, we got him.

260
00:29:58,303 --> 00:29:59,471
Good.

261
00:30:14,236 --> 00:30:15,612
Nice place, huh?

262
00:30:19,533 --> 00:30:22,119
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn?

263
00:30:22,244 --> 00:30:25,831
- You know who he is?
- No. Don't know who he is.

264
00:30:25,956 --> 00:30:26,957
Do you?

265
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:32,212
Nikon! Lord Nikon, this is...

266
00:30:32,337 --> 00:30:33,714
Crash Override.

267
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:36,216
Never heard of you.
You done anything?

268
00:30:36,341 --> 00:30:37,341
No.

269
00:30:39,261 --> 00:30:40,596
Come on!

270
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:46,101
What? Your Mom buy you
a 'puter for Christmas?

271
00:30:48,145 --> 00:30:51,231
- Does he know anything?
- Sure. He's elite.

272
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,900
Come in.

273
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:03,577
- Nikon, can I crash at your place tonight?
- Again?

274
00:31:05,245 --> 00:31:06,245
Yeah, sure.

275
00:31:10,918 --> 00:31:13,045
Hackers penetrate and ravage

276
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:16,757
public and private computer systems,
infecting them with viruses...

277
00:31:16,882 --> 00:31:18,509
Who are these guys?

278
00:31:19,593 --> 00:31:23,388
Richard Gill.
Hacker enemy number one. Real boner.

279
00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:26,725
Showtime. Showtime!

280
00:31:30,854 --> 00:31:32,648
- What's going on?
- Four,

281
00:31:32,773 --> 00:31:35,943
three, two, one...

282
00:31:38,028 --> 00:31:39,446
Welcome to our show!

283
00:31:39,571 --> 00:31:40,571
Hack the Planet!

284
00:31:40,656 --> 00:31:42,866
Hack the Planet!

285
00:31:43,659 --> 00:31:47,079
For late night hacks, Jolt Cola,
soft drink of the elite hacker.

286
00:31:47,204 --> 00:31:49,581
- Who are these guys?
- That's Razor and Blade.

287
00:31:50,582 --> 00:31:51,583
Razor and Blade?

288
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:54,169
That's right. This is a pay-phone.

289
00:31:55,045 --> 00:31:56,046
Don't ask.

290
00:31:56,505 --> 00:31:59,883
As you can see, this is just a simple
micro-cassette recorder.

291
00:32:00,008 --> 00:32:03,637
Hook it up to the phone,
and drop in five bucks in quarters.

292
00:32:03,762 --> 00:32:07,182
Record the tone the coins make,
hang up, get your money back.

293
00:32:07,307 --> 00:32:10,727
Never again pay for a service
that would be cheap,

294
00:32:10,853 --> 00:32:13,188
if it weren't run
by profiteering gluttons.

295
00:32:13,313 --> 00:32:16,900
Remember, hacking is more than
just a crime. It's a survival trait.

296
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,405
I'm a real wild child,
I’m a wild one

297
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,324
I’m a wild one

298
00:32:26,243 --> 00:32:29,913
Thank you! Thank you very much!

299
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:35,127
Joey! Joey! Thank you!

300
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:36,669
Freeze!

301
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,963
- What?
- Get out of there!

302
00:32:38,088 --> 00:32:39,088
Out!

303
00:32:39,339 --> 00:32:42,009
- Joey!
- Get in there!

304
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:44,011
Sit down!

305
00:32:44,678 --> 00:32:45,678
Lucy!

306
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:47,931
Where are you taking her?

307
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:50,476
Joey!

308
00:32:59,526 --> 00:33:01,653
- How's it going, Ray?
- Looks good, sir.

309
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,614
We got an uncorrupted hard drive.

310
00:33:03,947 --> 00:33:05,699
In English, please.

311
00:33:05,949 --> 00:33:07,785
I didn't protect the President
for ten years

312
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:09,828
to finish my career
feeling like an idiot.

313
00:33:09,953 --> 00:33:13,957
I'm sorry, sir. He didn't have time
to erase his computer files.

314
00:33:14,082 --> 00:33:17,961
Good. Let's finish up here.
Take him in for interrogation.

315
00:33:18,337 --> 00:33:20,297
Agent Gill, can you spare a moment?

316
00:33:21,006 --> 00:33:22,549
Why, of course, Jennifer.

317
00:33:22,883 --> 00:33:26,637
- Joey!
- How dangerous are hackers?

318
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:32,768
Hackers penetrate and ravage public
and private computer systems,

319
00:33:32,893 --> 00:33:36,605
infecting them with viruses
and stealing sensitive materials.

320
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,440
These people are terrorists.

321
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:57,209
Morning, gentlemen.

322
00:33:57,376 --> 00:33:58,752
Please, be seated.

323
00:33:59,545 --> 00:34:02,548
I see we're still dressing
in the dark, Eugene.

324
00:34:02,881 --> 00:34:06,468
Once again, don't call me Eugene.

325
00:34:06,635 --> 00:34:08,095
Our recent intruder

326
00:34:08,262 --> 00:34:13,600
penetrated using a superuser account,
giving him access to our whole system.

327
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:17,229
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.

328
00:34:17,938 --> 00:34:22,234
Someone didn't bother reading my memo
on commonly used passwords.

329
00:34:22,401 --> 00:34:26,321
As I meticulously pointed out,
the foremost used passwords are...

330
00:34:26,488 --> 00:34:31,410
'Love', 'Sex', 'Secret' and 'God'.

331
00:34:31,577 --> 00:34:35,372
So would Your Holiness
care to change her password?

332
00:34:36,582 --> 00:34:39,418
A hacker planted the virus.

333
00:34:40,169 --> 00:34:41,628
Virus?

334
00:34:44,631 --> 00:34:49,428
Yesterday, the ballast program
for a supertanker training model

335
00:34:49,595 --> 00:34:53,640
mistakenly thought the vessel was empty
and flooded its tanks.

336
00:34:53,807 --> 00:34:55,434
Excuse me?

337
00:34:56,226 --> 00:34:59,062
The little boat flipped over.

338
00:34:59,229 --> 00:35:04,067
A virus planted within the Gibson system
claimed responsibility.

339
00:35:04,234 --> 00:35:05,319
It left a note?

340
00:35:10,115 --> 00:35:15,370
Unless $5 million is transferred
to the following account in 7 days,

341
00:35:15,537 --> 00:35:18,457
I will capsize five tankers
in the Ellingson fleet.

342
00:35:18,624 --> 00:35:21,001
- Ls that...?
- That is the virus.

343
00:35:21,168 --> 00:35:23,087
Leonardo da Vinci.

344
00:35:23,504 --> 00:35:27,883
We have 26 ships at sea
and don't know which ones are infected.

345
00:35:28,175 --> 00:35:31,970
Well, put the ship's ballast
under manual control.

346
00:35:32,137 --> 00:35:33,597
There's no such thing any more.

347
00:35:33,722 --> 00:35:36,100
These ships are totally computerised.

348
00:35:36,266 --> 00:35:38,727
They rely on satellite navigation

349
00:35:38,894 --> 00:35:43,649
which links them to our network,
and the virus, wherever they are.

350
00:35:44,066 --> 00:35:45,859
What are we supposed to do?

351
00:35:47,069 --> 00:35:50,239
Luckily, you have a gifted
and talented security officer.

352
00:35:50,405 --> 00:35:54,159
I traced the hacker's call.
The Secret Service picked him up.

353
00:35:54,326 --> 00:35:58,914
I’ll search his files for the original
virus code and eliminate it.

354
00:35:59,081 --> 00:36:02,334
We expect you
to get on this right away.

355
00:36:04,211 --> 00:36:07,381
- How soon?
- As fast as I can.

356
00:36:07,548 --> 00:36:12,010
This is common in corporations
as large as ours. Don't worry about it.

357
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:15,722
The Secret Service
is helping us out, 100 percent.

358
00:36:17,558 --> 00:36:18,767
We'll be in touch.

359
00:36:19,309 --> 00:36:21,103
What the hell was that all about?

360
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:24,565
I had to move fast.
The hacker copied my garbage file.

361
00:36:24,731 --> 00:36:25,731
What?

362
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:29,486
I created da Vinci so we could
get the Secret Service

363
00:36:29,653 --> 00:36:33,073
to arrest the hacker and seize
the equipment, which we can't do alone.

364
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:39,705
- I don't want to go to jail for this.
- Relax. Think about the $25 million.

365
00:36:39,872 --> 00:36:46,211
But you created a virus that's going to
cause a worldwide ecological disaster.

366
00:36:46,378 --> 00:36:49,298
Just to arrest some hacker kid?

367
00:36:49,465 --> 00:36:51,258
Basically, yes.

368
00:36:51,967 --> 00:36:54,803
Jesus! You're sick, Eugene.

369
00:36:55,137 --> 00:36:56,305
I’ll take care of this.

370
00:36:57,514 --> 00:37:01,643
I can cancel it any time.
I don't need the code.

371
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:04,188
What better way to confiscate the disk

372
00:37:04,354 --> 00:37:07,357
and find out how much of
the garbage file was copied.

373
00:37:08,567 --> 00:37:09,567
Get it!

374
00:37:11,111 --> 00:37:13,781
Why did I ever trust you?

375
00:37:15,532 --> 00:37:19,578
Get the file, otherwise
you'll lose all your toys.

376
00:37:27,294 --> 00:37:31,215
Did you find the virus program
on the disks we confiscated?

377
00:37:31,715 --> 00:37:35,844
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.

378
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:42,518
Then he stashed it somewhere,
or he has an accomplice.

379
00:37:45,395 --> 00:37:50,067
We'll release him. Keep tight surveillance
and see if he leads us to your disk.

380
00:37:55,614 --> 00:37:59,743
Unit 3, outside suspect
Joey Pardella's apartment.

381
00:37:59,868 --> 00:38:02,955
Suspect still grounded... by his mother.

382
00:38:03,622 --> 00:38:04,832
Listen to this bullshit.

383
00:38:05,374 --> 00:38:09,920
'This is our world now. The world
of the electron and the switch,

384
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:12,089
'the beauty of the baud.

385
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:17,010
'We exist without nationality,
skin colour or religious bias.

386
00:38:17,177 --> 00:38:20,347
'You wage wars, murder,
cheat, lie to us,

387
00:38:20,514 --> 00:38:24,184
'and try to make us believe it's for
our own good, yet we're the criminals.

388
00:38:24,351 --> 00:38:28,814
'Yes, I am a criminal.
My crime is that of curiosity.

389
00:38:28,981 --> 00:38:33,569
'I am a hacker
and this is my manifesto.'

390
00:38:34,987 --> 00:38:36,613
Right? Manifesto?

391
00:38:36,822 --> 00:38:37,822
'You may stop me,

392
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:40,701
'but you can't stop us all.'

393
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:42,995
That's cool.

394
00:38:43,162 --> 00:38:45,205
- Cool?
- Yeah, cool.

395
00:38:45,372 --> 00:38:46,498
You think it's cool?

396
00:38:46,665 --> 00:38:51,628
- It's cool.
- It's not cool. It's commie bullshit.

397
00:38:59,762 --> 00:39:01,805
Can I crash at your place tonight?

398
00:39:02,848 --> 00:39:04,099
What's with him?

399
00:39:04,266 --> 00:39:07,394
His parents missed Woodstock
and he's been making up for it since.

400
00:39:07,561 --> 00:39:09,354
You hear about Joey's bust?

401
00:39:11,273 --> 00:39:14,026
Probably had something to do
with that bank in Idaho.

402
00:39:14,234 --> 00:39:16,028
You think he could hack a Gibson?

403
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:20,657
- Did you talk to him?
- No. His mom says he's grounded

404
00:39:20,824 --> 00:39:24,787
for his next three lifetimes. And no
'consorting with computer friends'.

405
00:39:25,204 --> 00:39:27,289
The Secret Service is out to get him.

406
00:39:27,748 --> 00:39:30,250
Want to go to a big party tonight?

407
00:39:30,876 --> 00:39:32,086
It's at Kate's.

408
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,420
I thought so.

409
00:39:35,923 --> 00:39:37,216
A little pelvis.

410
00:39:38,258 --> 00:39:39,343
A little pelvis.

411
00:39:57,528 --> 00:39:59,488
What the hell are you doing?

412
00:39:59,905 --> 00:40:01,115
Plague!

413
00:40:01,406 --> 00:40:02,658
Plague!

414
00:40:03,826 --> 00:40:04,826
Gill.

415
00:40:05,702 --> 00:40:07,287
I think we got something.

416
00:40:07,663 --> 00:40:10,707
Yuk!... Hard copy!

417
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,044
Dade Murphy.

418
00:40:15,921 --> 00:40:18,048
- Secret Service!
- Don't move!

419
00:40:18,173 --> 00:40:18,882
What are you...?

420
00:40:19,007 --> 00:40:20,342
Shut up!

421
00:40:22,177 --> 00:40:24,596
What are you doing? Get off me!

422
00:40:26,765 --> 00:40:27,765
God!

423
00:40:28,267 --> 00:40:31,019
Sit on the bed and keep your hands
where we can see them.

424
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,274
The year was 1988.

425
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:40,195
A nasty virus crashed
1,500 systems in one day.

426
00:40:43,282 --> 00:40:44,825
1,507.

427
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,743
It got you 7 years' probation.

428
00:40:47,661 --> 00:40:50,330
No computer. No touchtone phones.

429
00:40:51,915 --> 00:40:54,501
Must have been hell, huh, Zero Cool?

430
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:00,674
A virus has been planted in
the Ellingson Mineral computer system.

431
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:03,218
You were our prime suspect.

432
00:41:03,343 --> 00:41:06,805
Till we trashed your stuff
and found no trace of it.

433
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:11,685
We believe that Joey Pardella
is involved in this Ellingson virus.

434
00:41:11,977 --> 00:41:17,191
He or his accomplice has a disk that
Mr Belford needs to disable that virus.

435
00:41:18,358 --> 00:41:20,402
We want you to help us find it.

436
00:41:20,527 --> 00:41:21,527
Gill.

437
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:34,917
Loser.

438
00:41:37,669 --> 00:41:40,339
I can't believe you were only 11
when you wrote this.

439
00:41:43,592 --> 00:41:45,636
It's quite an impressive virus.

440
00:41:48,222 --> 00:41:49,223
Dade.

441
00:41:51,016 --> 00:41:55,938
I know how you might feel about narking
on your friends, but... we're hackers.

442
00:41:56,105 --> 00:42:00,734
For us, there's no such thing
as family and friends.

443
00:42:00,943 --> 00:42:05,739
We're each our own country,
with temporary allies and enemies.

444
00:42:08,867 --> 00:42:10,536
Let's make a treaty.

445
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:14,832
I'm sorry. Who are you?

446
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,839
I'm the one who understands you.

447
00:42:22,714 --> 00:42:25,384
Now, can we be allies?

448
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:31,348
Nah. I don't play well with others.

449
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,575
Shit! Come on!

450
00:42:50,075 --> 00:42:52,911
Watch which friends you do play with.

451
00:42:53,078 --> 00:42:58,959
With your record, you could land in jail
or get expelled. No college. No future.

452
00:42:59,835 --> 00:43:03,714
Exiled from everyone
and everything you love.

453
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:08,886
I’ll be in touch.

454
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:12,556
He's fine.
Oh, and Dade,

455
00:43:14,141 --> 00:43:17,102
- try to stay out of trouble, okay?
- Blow me.

456
00:43:18,604 --> 00:43:19,688
Thank you.

457
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:29,967
Her Mom makes big bucks
writing books for women.

458
00:44:30,259 --> 00:44:33,679
Stuff like 'Women Who Love Men
Who Are Emotional Amoebae'.

459
00:44:34,388 --> 00:44:35,639
That explains a lot.

460
00:44:52,614 --> 00:44:55,951
Big man, stepping in.
Coming through.

461
00:44:56,535 --> 00:44:59,788
Big man, big boots.
You look good, girl.

462
00:45:03,751 --> 00:45:07,880
- Yo, what's up, Nikon?
- In the house, man. Thanks.

463
00:45:08,422 --> 00:45:09,882
Dade, man. You made it.

464
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,135
Houston, we have lift-off.

465
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:16,263
Three o'clock. Check it.
Don't look right away!

466
00:45:16,388 --> 00:45:17,931
Look at her, man.

467
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:26,857
Lisa Blair.
26 East 7th Street, apartment 16.

468
00:45:26,982 --> 00:45:28,233
5554817.

469
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,234
Boom!

470
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:32,863
- How'd you know that?
- I got a photographic memory.

471
00:45:33,655 --> 00:45:34,823
It's a curse.

472
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:36,283
Lisa!

473
00:45:42,122 --> 00:45:47,419
Oh! Look at that pooper, man.
Spandex, it's a privilege, not a right.

474
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:56,762
Hi, my name's Vicki and I’m an addict.

475
00:45:58,263 --> 00:46:00,808
Hi. My name's Hank and I’m an addict.

476
00:46:03,268 --> 00:46:04,645
My name's Joey, but...

477
00:46:05,813 --> 00:46:06,897
I’m not an addict.

478
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:09,316
No, really. Listen.

479
00:46:09,525 --> 00:46:11,193
I got in trouble with my computer.

480
00:46:11,318 --> 00:46:15,364
My lawyer told the judge I’m an addict,
but I’m not addicted to my computer.

481
00:46:15,823 --> 00:46:16,823
No, really.

482
00:46:17,491 --> 00:46:18,575
I'm not an addict.

483
00:46:18,951 --> 00:46:19,951
I'm not.

484
00:46:21,537 --> 00:46:22,871
Can I get some more coffee?

485
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,261
Yo! Check this out.
This is insanely great.

486
00:46:37,386 --> 00:46:39,513
It's got a 28.8 bps modem.

487
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,599
- Yeah? Display?
- Active matrix.

488
00:46:42,724 --> 00:46:44,852
A million psychedelic colours.

489
00:46:44,977 --> 00:46:46,562
This baby is sweet.

490
00:46:47,479 --> 00:46:50,274
- I want it.
- I want it to have my children.

491
00:46:50,566 --> 00:46:52,566
- Bet it looks crispy in the dark.
- Hit the light.

492
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:11,795
Shit!

493
00:47:13,088 --> 00:47:15,132
Come on. Get out.

494
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:17,676
- Was that her top?
- One-handed.

495
00:47:18,093 --> 00:47:19,428
Difficulty rating?

496
00:47:20,596 --> 00:47:21,597
Seven.

497
00:47:24,516 --> 00:47:28,687
Wow!... Burn's wetware
matches her software.

498
00:47:30,355 --> 00:47:31,732
Burn?

499
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:34,818
What are you doing here?

500
00:47:34,943 --> 00:47:37,780
We're sorry! Just looking
at your fly laptop.

501
00:47:37,905 --> 00:47:39,364
It's hype, you know.

502
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:40,949
You're in the butter zone now, baby.

503
00:47:44,119 --> 00:47:45,454
Yeah, it is.

504
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:48,540
I want to triple the RAM.

505
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:53,420
Leopard boy and the deceptor cons.

506
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:58,467
Kate! You're not going into that
computer shit now, right?

507
00:48:00,427 --> 00:48:01,678
Later, babe.

508
00:48:03,263 --> 00:48:06,183
- Yeah, right.
- The sensitive type.

509
00:48:08,435 --> 00:48:09,812
What's he doing here?

510
00:48:09,937 --> 00:48:11,563
He's my guest, Burn.

511
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:13,107
You're Acid Burn?!

512
00:48:13,273 --> 00:48:15,150
You booted me out of OTV.

513
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:18,654
- What?
- I’m Crash Override.

514
00:48:19,404 --> 00:48:22,241
You're the moron
who's been invading my turf?

515
00:48:23,909 --> 00:48:25,160
Whoa, whoa! Crash...

516
00:48:25,285 --> 00:48:26,286
and Burn!

517
00:48:39,133 --> 00:48:41,343
Murphy kid turn you down?

518
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:47,891
I disguised myself as an Alabama State
Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.

519
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:49,309
Pervert.

520
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,020
What are you talking about?

521
00:48:54,481 --> 00:48:58,277
The FBI computer holds files
on 20 million Americans.

522
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:00,946
I just hacked into it.

523
00:49:01,447 --> 00:49:02,990
Congratulations.

524
00:49:03,699 --> 00:49:07,661
I have access to every piece of data
stored on Dade Murphy's parents.

525
00:49:08,746 --> 00:49:14,168
His parents separated five years ago,
reconciled, then divorced last year.

526
00:49:14,293 --> 00:49:15,419
Custody battle.

527
00:49:15,586 --> 00:49:17,755
Boy chose to go with his mother.

528
00:49:18,172 --> 00:49:19,172
So?

529
00:49:20,507 --> 00:49:25,721
So, we get the mother, we get the boy.

530
00:50:12,684 --> 00:50:14,311
What the hell are you doing?

531
00:50:15,229 --> 00:50:17,064
It's cool, I’m just looking.

532
00:50:18,607 --> 00:50:21,276
- It's too much machine for you.
- Yeah?

533
00:50:32,454 --> 00:50:34,748
I hope you don't screw like you type.

534
00:50:41,672 --> 00:50:43,424
It has a killer refresh rate.

535
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,512
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.

536
00:50:48,637 --> 00:50:51,932
It's not just the chip. Lt has a PCI bus.

537
00:50:52,057 --> 00:50:54,184
But... you knew that.

538
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:56,478
Indeed.

539
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:59,106
RISC architecture is going
to change everything.

540
00:50:59,231 --> 00:51:01,692
Yeah. RISC is good.

541
00:51:06,697 --> 00:51:09,867
Sure this sweet machine's
not going to waste?

542
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:14,621
Crash Override. What was it?

543
00:51:14,913 --> 00:51:19,084
'Mess with the best, die like the rest'?

544
00:51:19,752 --> 00:51:20,753
Yeah.

545
00:51:25,507 --> 00:51:26,884
Are you challenging me?

546
00:51:27,009 --> 00:51:28,093
Name your stakes.

547
00:51:29,178 --> 00:51:32,473
If I win, you become my slave.

548
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:35,559
Your slave?

549
00:51:36,101 --> 00:51:37,311
You wish.

550
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:41,273
You'll do shit work.
Scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.

551
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:43,317
Deal. And if I win?

552
00:51:43,442 --> 00:51:45,778
Make it my first born.

553
00:51:45,903 --> 00:51:48,322
- Make it our first date.
- You won't win.

554
00:51:49,531 --> 00:51:50,741
And you have to smile.

555
00:51:50,866 --> 00:51:53,535
I don't do dates.

556
00:51:54,286 --> 00:51:57,498
But I don't lose, either. So you're on.

557
00:52:03,879 --> 00:52:06,715
Here's the deal, the chosen contest:

558
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:10,636
To hassle Secret Service Agent
Richard Gill and get one back for Joey.

559
00:52:16,183 --> 00:52:20,395
Our decisions are final
by a vote of two to one. No appeals.

560
00:52:23,232 --> 00:52:26,610
The duel will last
until we declare a winner.

561
00:52:30,155 --> 00:52:34,910
Use only the access codes
and passwords in your collection.

562
00:52:35,035 --> 00:52:36,453
No help from us.

563
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:43,168
Talking to me?

564
00:52:45,212 --> 00:52:46,630
Any questions?

565
00:52:46,755 --> 00:52:50,467
Yeah. Who's going to notify
his next of kin?

566
00:53:43,729 --> 00:53:45,898
He's in the personal ads.

567
00:53:48,942 --> 00:53:53,530
'Disappointed white male, cross-dresser,
looking for discreet friend

568
00:53:53,655 --> 00:53:55,991
'to bring dreams to reality.

569
00:53:56,116 --> 00:54:01,747
'Leather, lace and water sports.
Transvestites welcome.'

570
00:54:01,872 --> 00:54:05,084
I know where you can stick it.

571
00:54:05,876 --> 00:54:08,921
I just want to lick
your earlobes and your lips.

572
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:11,799
You want to lick something? Lick this!

573
00:54:12,966 --> 00:54:14,760
That's why they call me Stallion.

574
00:54:14,885 --> 00:54:16,303
That's disgusting!

575
00:54:16,637 --> 00:54:18,347
My heart is steaming for you...

576
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,934
- ..spank you with...
- I’ll spank your ass!

577
00:54:22,101 --> 00:54:24,394
- ..turn you over and...
- Agghh!

578
00:54:24,937 --> 00:54:25,937
Animal!

579
00:55:10,232 --> 00:55:13,527
Hey!... Hey! Do you know who I am?

580
00:55:13,652 --> 00:55:15,529
Do you know who I am?

581
00:55:38,677 --> 00:55:43,015
This is Accounting, sir. You inquired
about Agent Richard Gill?

582
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,140
Yes.

583
00:55:44,141 --> 00:55:47,978
- Our records indicate he's deceased.
- I’m what?

584
00:55:48,103 --> 00:55:49,438
- Dead.
- Dead?

585
00:55:49,563 --> 00:55:52,733
Yeah. Like rigor mortis, habeas corpus.

586
00:55:52,858 --> 00:55:56,111
- Very impressive.
- Superhero-like, even.

587
00:55:57,154 --> 00:55:58,280
Yeah, whatever.

588
00:55:59,323 --> 00:56:00,616
What's the score?

589
00:56:03,744 --> 00:56:04,745
Tie.

590
00:56:06,872 --> 00:56:09,416
Come on. Due to Mr Gill's
untimely demise,

591
00:56:09,541 --> 00:56:12,836
- you'll have to improvise the next round.
- Right.

592
00:56:13,879 --> 00:56:15,297
I win,

593
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:18,217
you wear a dress on our date.

594
00:56:19,343 --> 00:56:20,344
And if I win,

595
00:56:20,969 --> 00:56:22,346
so do you.

596
00:56:27,351 --> 00:56:28,351
Deal.

597
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:07,640
Dade.

598
00:57:08,976 --> 00:57:11,854
I didn't know your size,
so... I guessed.

599
00:57:13,939 --> 00:57:15,566
You will stick with the deal?

600
00:57:26,618 --> 00:57:27,619
Thanks.

601
00:57:41,133 --> 00:57:45,637
You wanted to know who I am, Zero Cool?
Let me explain...

602
00:57:45,763 --> 00:57:47,765
the new world order.

603
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:51,226
Governments and corporations
need people like you...

604
00:57:51,351 --> 00:57:53,020
and me.

605
00:57:53,145 --> 00:57:57,733
We are the samurai,
the keyboard cowboys.

606
00:57:57,816 --> 00:57:59,735
And those other people out there,

607
00:57:59,902 --> 00:58:03,989
who have no idea what's going on,
are the cattle.

608
00:58:04,156 --> 00:58:06,283
Moo.

609
00:58:06,408 --> 00:58:10,496
I need your help. You need my help.

610
00:58:10,621 --> 00:58:13,624
Let me help you earn your spurs.

611
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,043
Think about it.

612
00:58:17,503 --> 00:58:20,589
Enjoy the laptop... Cool.

613
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,884
Tell me where the disk is.

614
00:58:31,058 --> 00:58:32,935
You look pitiful.

615
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:39,316
Okay, you're not grounded any more.

616
00:59:05,676 --> 00:59:08,595
- Yo, what's up?
- I gotta talk to you, man. Listen.

617
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,474
- I copied a garbage file.
- So? A garbage file has shit in it.

618
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:14,768
It's hot or something.

619
00:59:14,893 --> 00:59:19,606
Joey, a garbage file holds odd data.
Stuff that's been erased.

620
00:59:19,731 --> 00:59:21,733
I copied it from Ellingson, okay?

621
00:59:21,859 --> 00:59:24,695
They're asking me about it.
Will you take a look for me?

622
00:59:27,906 --> 00:59:29,408
Shit, Joey. You got a tail.

623
00:59:30,868 --> 00:59:31,869
Shit!

624
01:00:17,206 --> 01:00:20,084
I am watching you.

625
01:00:23,295 --> 01:00:24,505
Wake up.

626
01:00:26,381 --> 01:00:27,466
Ramon?

627
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:31,053
Wake up. Ramon, it's time for school.

628
01:00:32,137 --> 01:00:33,138
Come on.

629
01:00:35,766 --> 01:00:37,893
Stick your hands up! Don't move!

630
01:00:38,018 --> 01:00:39,186
Déjà vu!

631
01:00:39,311 --> 01:00:43,023
You're under arrest under the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.

632
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:44,858
¡La computadora de mierda!

633
01:00:44,983 --> 01:00:46,860
¡Que Te dije de no estar
jugando con esa

634
01:00:46,985 --> 01:00:49,363
- computadora!
- What are you waiting for? Arrest me!

635
01:01:00,749 --> 01:01:03,001
You get one call.

636
01:01:04,294 --> 01:01:05,629
Uno.

637
01:01:06,422 --> 01:01:08,048
Understand?

638
01:01:23,147 --> 01:01:25,065
Operator Services?

639
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:27,234
- I’m having trouble with a number.
- What number, please?

640
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:29,319
5554202.

641
01:01:29,445 --> 01:01:31,029
- Just one moment.
- Thank you.

642
01:01:32,614 --> 01:01:34,783
- Hello?
- It's me. I’m freaking.

643
01:01:34,908 --> 01:01:39,204
Joey really hacked into Ellingson.
He gave me the disk he copied

644
01:01:39,329 --> 01:01:42,166
and now I'm in jail
for some serious shit!

645
01:01:42,291 --> 01:01:45,961
Stuff I didn't even do, like inserting
a virus called 'da Vinci'?

646
01:01:46,086 --> 01:01:48,088
And they keep asking about you guys.

647
01:01:48,213 --> 01:01:49,798
- Think they're gonna bust us?
- Yeah.

648
01:01:49,923 --> 01:01:52,968
You better figure out what's on that disk
'cause we're being framed.

649
01:01:53,093 --> 01:01:55,220
It's in the place where
I put that thing once.

650
01:02:31,215 --> 01:02:32,215
Hi.

651
01:02:34,051 --> 01:02:35,531
Now I see what all the fuss is about.

652
01:02:42,434 --> 01:02:43,977
You have company.

653
01:02:47,564 --> 01:02:49,733
- Nice room.
- We need your help.

654
01:02:51,735 --> 01:02:53,946
Do my ears deceive me?

655
01:02:56,490 --> 01:02:59,743
No, no. Truce, you guys.
We got a higher purpose here.

656
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:02,121
A wake-up call for
the Nintendo generation.

657
01:03:02,246 --> 01:03:03,956
We demand free access to data.

658
01:03:04,081 --> 01:03:06,750
Well, it comes with some responsibility.

659
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,213
'When I was a child, I spoke as a child,
I thought as a child.

660
01:03:11,338 --> 01:03:14,383
'But when I became a man,
I put away childish things'.

661
01:03:14,925 --> 01:03:18,053
What? It's Corinthians One,

662
01:03:18,178 --> 01:03:21,890
Chapter 13, verse 11, you know?
Come on.

663
01:03:26,311 --> 01:03:28,689
Phreak and Joey are being framed.

664
01:03:28,814 --> 01:03:31,191
Can you help us find out
what's on this disk?

665
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,443
I can't.

666
01:03:32,943 --> 01:03:36,196
Everybody who touches that disk
gets arrested. I can't risk arrest.

667
01:03:36,321 --> 01:03:37,531
I'm sorry.

668
01:03:41,827 --> 01:03:44,079
Maybe I should go to the bathroom.

669
01:03:51,879 --> 01:03:53,380
What is it with you?

670
01:03:54,381 --> 01:03:58,927
We're supposed to be on the same side
and we really need your help.

671
01:04:00,554 --> 01:04:02,389
I really need your help.

672
01:04:04,683 --> 01:04:07,102
I'm sorry. I can't.

673
01:04:11,565 --> 01:04:13,108
Could you copy the disk?

674
01:04:13,233 --> 01:04:17,196
And just hide it in case we get busted
so we have a copy for our lawyers.

675
01:04:17,321 --> 01:04:19,281
Something that hasn't been
tampered with.

676
01:04:23,911 --> 01:04:25,954
You guys help yourself
to anything in the fridge.

677
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,581
Cereal has.

678
01:04:33,796 --> 01:04:36,215
Okay. I’ll copy it.

679
01:04:36,423 --> 01:04:37,423
Thank you.

680
01:04:44,681 --> 01:04:46,558
The girl. The girl has the disk I need.

681
01:04:47,851 --> 01:04:50,312
I told you.
I don't play well with others.

682
01:04:51,105 --> 01:04:53,023
Turn on your laptop.

683
01:04:53,857 --> 01:04:56,026
Set it to receive a file.

684
01:05:03,951 --> 01:05:08,080
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon
in the state of Washington.

685
01:05:09,498 --> 01:05:12,835
Forgery, embezzlement,
two drug convictions

686
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:17,214
plus jumping parole. Once arrested,
she will have no trial,

687
01:05:17,339 --> 01:05:21,552
she will not pass 'Go',
she will go directly to jail.

688
01:05:21,677 --> 01:05:27,558
Then I change this file back to the
original and your mom disappears.

689
01:05:27,683 --> 01:05:28,892
That's bullshit.

690
01:05:29,518 --> 01:05:33,439
What can I tell you?
Computers never lie, kid.

691
01:05:34,523 --> 01:05:40,279
Your mom will be arrested,
handcuffed and later strip-searched.

692
01:05:40,362 --> 01:05:43,073
You lay a finger on her and I’ll kill you.

693
01:05:43,949 --> 01:05:46,243
Kid, don't threaten me.

694
01:05:46,702 --> 01:05:51,331
There are worse things than death...
and I can do all of them.

695
01:06:30,746 --> 01:06:31,914
Talk to me.

696
01:06:32,039 --> 01:06:35,584
I got it. But Kate didn't know
what's on it,

697
01:06:35,709 --> 01:06:37,711
she came to me to figure it out.

698
01:06:38,587 --> 01:06:41,423
She didn't plant the virus.
You leave her alone.

699
01:06:41,548 --> 01:06:45,385
Don't worry, kid. If she’s innocent,

700
01:06:45,511 --> 01:06:47,012
she'll be fine.

701
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:51,433
Your mommy's safe now, okay?

702
01:08:14,183 --> 01:08:15,183
Kate, Listen.

703
01:08:15,893 --> 01:08:17,019
Hold on.

704
01:08:17,186 --> 01:08:19,938
- I have to tell you something.
- Hold on!

705
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:23,442
- It's so lean and clean.
- Looks like a hacker wrote it.

706
01:08:24,151 --> 01:08:25,861
Come here. Look at this.

707
01:08:26,487 --> 01:08:28,280
This thing is tense.

708
01:08:29,323 --> 01:08:30,949
That's ill, man.

709
01:08:31,450 --> 01:08:32,910
It's incomplete.

710
01:08:34,286 --> 01:08:37,831
This'll take forever to figure out.
I’ll make some coffee.

711
01:08:41,210 --> 01:08:42,669
Tag, you're in.

712
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,837
- It's not a virus. It's a worm.
- What's it eat?

713
01:10:07,004 --> 01:10:08,797
It nibbles. You see all of this?

714
01:10:08,922 --> 01:10:12,176
This is all of Ellingson's
financial transactions.

715
01:10:12,342 --> 01:10:15,846
From million dollar deals
to $10 some guy pays for gas.

716
01:10:16,013 --> 01:10:17,973
The worm eats a few cents
from each transaction.

717
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:20,601
No-one's caught it because
the money isn't really gone.

718
01:10:20,768 --> 01:10:22,561
It's just data being shifted around.

719
01:10:22,728 --> 01:10:26,940
And when the worm's ready, it zips out
with the money and erases its tracks.

720
01:10:27,065 --> 01:10:29,485
Joey got cut off before he got
to that part. Check it out.

721
01:10:29,651 --> 01:10:33,697
Here it's already running
at twice the speed as when it started.

722
01:10:33,864 --> 01:10:36,533
- At this rate, the run ends in...
- ..two days.

723
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:41,288
- It's already eaten about...
- ..21 .8 million bucks.

724
01:10:42,623 --> 01:10:45,626
Whoever wrote this
needs someone to take the fall.

725
01:10:45,751 --> 01:10:48,504
That's Phreak and Joey and us.

726
01:10:48,670 --> 01:10:52,883
We have to find out where the money's
going before the worm disappears,

727
01:10:53,050 --> 01:10:55,344
so we can find out who created it.

728
01:10:55,511 --> 01:10:56,720
I know who wrote it!

729
01:10:57,221 --> 01:10:58,221
What?

730
01:10:58,263 --> 01:10:59,890
This Ellingson security creep.

731
01:11:00,516 --> 01:11:03,602
I gave him a copy of the disk
you gave me.

732
01:11:03,769 --> 01:11:04,769
You what?

733
01:11:04,812 --> 01:11:06,522
I didn't know what was on it.

734
01:11:06,647 --> 01:11:10,067
Oh, man! That's universally stupid, man.

735
01:11:10,234 --> 01:11:11,777
Yo, man. You're an amateur.

736
01:11:13,445 --> 01:11:14,530
Why did he come to you?

737
01:11:14,696 --> 01:11:16,490
I’ve got a record.

738
01:11:16,907 --> 01:11:18,534
I was Zero Cool.

739
01:11:18,659 --> 01:11:24,832
Zero Cool crashed 1,507 systems
in one day. Biggest crash in history.

740
01:11:24,998 --> 01:11:28,001
Front page New York Times,
August 10, 1988.

741
01:11:29,336 --> 01:11:31,046
I thought you was black, man.

742
01:11:31,672 --> 01:11:34,007
Yo, man, this is Zero Cool!

743
01:11:34,925 --> 01:11:36,009
That's far out!

744
01:11:36,176 --> 01:11:37,553
This is Zero Cool, man!

745
01:11:38,971 --> 01:11:40,514
Yeah, that's great.

746
01:11:40,973 --> 01:11:41,973
There goes MIT.

747
01:11:42,057 --> 01:11:44,143
- I’ll make it up!
- How?

748
01:11:45,436 --> 01:11:46,645
I’ll hack the Gibson.

749
01:11:46,812 --> 01:11:48,814
They'll trace you like that, man.

750
01:11:48,981 --> 01:11:50,774
The cops will find you
with a smoking gun.

751
01:11:50,899 --> 01:11:52,151
Fucked if I care, man.

752
01:11:52,317 --> 01:11:55,487
Even with the password,
it'd take you ten minutes to get in,

753
01:11:55,654 --> 01:11:57,281
then you'd have to find the files.

754
01:11:57,406 --> 01:11:59,658
The cops would have you in five minutes.

755
01:11:59,825 --> 01:12:02,494
Oh, wow! We are fried!

756
01:12:02,619 --> 01:12:05,122
Never send a boy to do a woman's job.

757
01:12:05,289 --> 01:12:07,374
With me, we can do it in seven.

758
01:12:07,624 --> 01:12:10,169
I help, we do it in six.

759
01:12:10,335 --> 01:12:14,548
I gotta save all your asses!
I help, we do it in five minutes.

760
01:12:14,715 --> 01:12:17,176
Okay. Let's go shopping.

761
01:12:45,579 --> 01:12:46,663
You know,

762
01:12:47,289 --> 01:12:52,336
if I didn't live by a strict code of honour,
I might take advantage of this situation.

763
01:12:52,461 --> 01:12:54,505
Erotically, as it were.

764
01:13:19,196 --> 01:13:21,115
All right. Hold it right there.

765
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:27,704
Shit!

766
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:29,873
My subway defence system.

767
01:13:35,629 --> 01:13:37,172
He's way down there.

768
01:13:38,966 --> 01:13:39,967
Ta-da!

769
01:13:40,509 --> 01:13:44,012
- Yo, brain-dead... the manual!
- Oops!

770
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:51,061
Hey!

771
01:13:51,645 --> 01:13:52,646
Truck!

772
01:13:56,859 --> 01:13:57,860
Find it?

773
01:13:59,153 --> 01:14:02,489
The phone's all right. The problem
must be somewhere else.

774
01:14:42,404 --> 01:14:46,658
They had a large chunk
of the garbage file?

775
01:14:49,453 --> 01:14:53,040
- How much do they know?
- Enough to implicate us.

776
01:14:53,165 --> 01:14:55,834
You said the worm was untraceable.

777
01:14:55,959 --> 01:14:58,921
Yeah... to civilians.
But they're hackers.

778
01:14:59,046 --> 01:15:02,716
Don't worry.
We just launch the da Vinci virus.

779
01:15:03,383 --> 01:15:06,303
- Then they'll all be put away.
- Launch the da Vinci virus?

780
01:15:06,428 --> 01:15:10,182
- You can't do that.
- No-one believes the guilty.

781
01:15:10,307 --> 01:15:16,188
By the time they realise the truth,
we'll be long gone with all our money.

782
01:15:16,939 --> 01:15:20,067
Look, there is no right and wrong.

783
01:15:20,275 --> 01:15:23,153
There is only fun... and boring.

784
01:15:24,154 --> 01:15:27,741
A 30-year prison sentence
sounds pretty dull to me.

785
01:15:28,075 --> 01:15:29,535
Who do you prefer serves it?

786
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:32,246
Us... or them?

787
01:15:50,055 --> 01:15:55,477
Unless $5 million is transferred
to the following account in seven days,

788
01:15:55,602 --> 01:15:58,647
I will capsize five Ellingson tankers.

789
01:15:58,772 --> 01:16:01,150
The virus goes off
tomorrow at 10.30AM,

790
01:16:01,275 --> 01:16:03,986
and those hackers tried
to get into our system again.

791
01:16:04,111 --> 01:16:07,114
I insist you take more strenuous action

792
01:16:07,239 --> 01:16:11,201
or Ellingson Mineral will hold
the Secret Service responsible.

793
01:16:14,872 --> 01:16:18,292
Get me arrest warrants
on Kate Libby, alias Acid Burn,

794
01:16:18,417 --> 01:16:20,836
Emmanuel Goldstein,
alias Cereal Killer,

795
01:16:20,961 --> 01:16:23,922
Dade Murphy,
alias Crash Override, also known as

796
01:16:24,047 --> 01:16:28,969
Zero Cool, and Paul Cook,
alias Lord Nikon.

797
01:16:29,303 --> 01:16:31,764
Pick them up tomorrow at 9.00AM.

798
01:16:33,599 --> 01:16:34,641
Snoop on to them

799
01:16:34,767 --> 01:16:36,810
as they snoop on to us.

800
01:16:42,024 --> 01:16:46,612
- Yeah, it's Kate.
- Hey, Burn. We got a little problem.

801
01:17:04,671 --> 01:17:05,756
So, what've we got?

802
01:17:05,881 --> 01:17:10,427
Well, 50 passwords, plus whatever
Polaroid-head got inside Ellingson.

803
01:17:10,552 --> 01:17:12,179
I got a lot, right?

804
01:17:12,513 --> 01:17:14,348
I don't know how many, but...

805
01:17:15,307 --> 01:17:16,433
my head hurts.

806
01:17:16,558 --> 01:17:18,060
Yo, check this out.

807
01:17:18,936 --> 01:17:20,562
- What's a da Vinci virus?
- What?

808
01:17:20,687 --> 01:17:25,484
It's a memo about how they'll deal with
the oil spills that happened on the 14th.

809
01:17:26,610 --> 01:17:27,945
What oil spills?

810
01:17:29,988 --> 01:17:33,784
- Brain-dead. Today's the 13th.
- Well, this hasn't happened yet.

811
01:17:33,992 --> 01:17:36,662
The 14th is the day the worm ends it run.

812
01:17:39,415 --> 01:17:43,001
Isn't the da Vinci virus
what Phreak's being charged with?

813
01:17:43,127 --> 01:17:47,131
Look. 'infecting ballast programs
of Ellingson tankers'.

814
01:17:47,423 --> 01:17:48,549
They blame hackers!

815
01:17:48,674 --> 01:17:49,675
Damn!

816
01:17:49,967 --> 01:17:51,927
A worm and a virus?

817
01:17:52,094 --> 01:17:53,637
The plot thickens.

818
01:17:59,685 --> 01:18:01,562
Whoa, whoa! Where are you going?

819
01:18:01,687 --> 01:18:02,688
I got an idea.

820
01:18:03,313 --> 01:18:05,649
We got a few hours until we're arrested.

821
01:18:05,774 --> 01:18:08,694
Stay low. I’m going to get help.

822
01:18:08,819 --> 01:18:10,446
I'll beep you.

823
01:18:12,948 --> 01:18:13,949
Are you coming?

824
01:18:18,454 --> 01:18:20,497
May the Force be with you, man.

825
01:18:48,942 --> 01:18:50,402
There they are!

826
01:18:50,944 --> 01:18:54,323
Razor and Blade?! They're flakes!

827
01:18:54,490 --> 01:18:57,951
They're elite! Let's get 'em.

828
01:19:49,837 --> 01:19:53,006
Get off the stage, man! Get off!

829
01:20:16,655 --> 01:20:18,115
I lost them!

830
01:20:19,825 --> 01:20:21,118
Where were you?

831
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:38,093
I don't like this.

832
01:20:43,098 --> 01:20:45,350
I definitely don't like this.

833
01:20:45,642 --> 01:20:47,728
What do you want?

834
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:53,776
We come in peace.

835
01:20:55,903 --> 01:20:58,572
We need your help, if you're up to it.

836
01:20:59,865 --> 01:21:02,076
She's buff. Ballsy.

837
01:21:03,118 --> 01:21:04,161
Let's keep her.

838
01:21:04,328 --> 01:21:05,454
Waste the dude.

839
01:21:12,461 --> 01:21:17,257
A virus called da Vinci will cause
oil spills tomorrow at 10.30AM.

840
01:21:17,633 --> 01:21:20,094
It's somehow connected to that worm.

841
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:25,099
We need you to overload the Gibson so
we can kill da Vinci and copy the worm.

842
01:21:25,682 --> 01:21:28,519
She's rabid... but cute.

843
01:21:29,019 --> 01:21:31,688
See, we're very busy.

844
01:21:31,855 --> 01:21:37,945
A TV network that wishes to remain
nameless is interested in our show.

845
01:21:38,862 --> 01:21:40,239
Let's go, Kate.

846
01:21:43,117 --> 01:21:44,493
Wait.

847
01:21:45,369 --> 01:21:47,371
Nobody said no.

848
01:21:47,955 --> 01:21:52,167
But you will need more than
just two media icons like us.

849
01:21:52,709 --> 01:21:53,709
You need an army.

850
01:21:53,836 --> 01:21:59,007
That's it. An electronic army.
If I were us,

851
01:21:59,174 --> 01:22:03,053
I’d get on the Internet,
send out a major distress signal.

852
01:22:03,637 --> 01:22:05,097
Hackers of the world, unite!

853
01:22:05,389 --> 01:22:07,015
How will you take care of the cops?

854
01:22:27,661 --> 01:22:29,163
I'm blowing up!

855
01:22:29,288 --> 01:22:31,874
It's Kate. Grand Central.
Let's hit it!

856
01:23:40,526 --> 01:23:41,610
You're the man!

857
01:23:42,611 --> 01:23:43,611
You're the man!

858
01:24:04,341 --> 01:24:06,260
Joey, you made it!

859
01:24:10,764 --> 01:24:13,475
Okay. Use your best viruses
to buy us some time.

860
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,436
We must get in and copy the worm.

861
01:24:17,980 --> 01:24:20,023
I had to do that to break the tension.

862
01:24:20,899 --> 01:24:23,610
- Cereal. Go fix the phones.
- Roger.

863
01:24:25,863 --> 01:24:27,656
Joey, take his place.

864
01:24:28,866 --> 01:24:30,784
- Me?
- Take his place. Do it.

865
01:24:30,993 --> 01:24:32,411
You can do it.

866
01:24:33,454 --> 01:24:34,455
Ready?

867
01:24:36,165 --> 01:24:37,791
Let's boot up.

868
01:25:33,639 --> 01:25:37,184
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Nothing. Just a minor glitch.

869
01:25:37,309 --> 01:25:40,521
A minor glitch with you seems
to turn into a major catastrophe.

870
01:25:46,693 --> 01:25:48,695
There's a new virus in the database.

871
01:25:48,821 --> 01:25:50,072
What's happening?

872
01:25:50,197 --> 01:25:52,324
It's eating memory. What do I do?

873
01:25:52,449 --> 01:25:53,617
Type 'cookie', you idiot.

874
01:25:53,742 --> 01:25:55,661
I’ll head them off at the pass.

875
01:25:59,915 --> 01:26:02,459
We have a bug attacking all log-in files.

876
01:26:02,584 --> 01:26:04,962
Run anti-virus.
Give me a systems display.

877
01:26:12,302 --> 01:26:13,846
Die, dickweeds!

878
01:26:17,516 --> 01:26:19,101
A rabbit's in the system.

879
01:26:19,226 --> 01:26:20,226
Send a flu shot.

880
01:26:20,227 --> 01:26:22,980
Rabbit? Flu shot? Someone talk to me.

881
01:26:23,105 --> 01:26:27,234
A rabbit replicates till it overloads
a file then spreads like cancer.

882
01:26:27,359 --> 01:26:28,444
Cancer?

883
01:26:29,278 --> 01:26:33,407
Row, row, row your boat

884
01:26:33,532 --> 01:26:35,909
Gently down the stream.

885
01:26:36,034 --> 01:26:38,954
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,

886
01:26:39,079 --> 01:26:41,498
Life is but a dream.

887
01:26:43,125 --> 01:26:44,752
Whoa! Falling off!

888
01:26:45,627 --> 01:26:47,379
It's a Gibson, it's finding us too fast.

889
01:27:03,061 --> 01:27:05,898
There's too many garbage files.
I need more time.

890
01:27:12,613 --> 01:27:17,367
They're at Grand Central station,
lower level. Don't screw up.

891
01:27:17,493 --> 01:27:18,952
Get out of here!

892
01:27:19,078 --> 01:27:22,206
Everyone, let's move! Move it!

893
01:27:22,623 --> 01:27:24,458
Get the hell out of the way! Come on!

894
01:27:24,583 --> 01:27:26,251
Grand Central!

895
01:27:30,547 --> 01:27:34,384
Game's over. Last chance to get out
of this without a prison sentence.

896
01:27:34,510 --> 01:27:35,870
You're not good enough to beat me.

897
01:27:35,969 --> 01:27:39,640
Maybe I’m not. But we are,

898
01:27:39,765 --> 01:27:42,226
- you asshole!
- Give it up!

899
01:27:43,310 --> 01:27:46,021
Just give it up.

900
01:27:49,817 --> 01:27:51,276
Are we fashionably late?

901
01:27:57,199 --> 01:27:58,534
Okay, let's go!

902
01:29:05,559 --> 01:29:08,979
We have massive infection.
Multiple GPI viruses...

903
01:29:09,104 --> 01:29:10,355
..from remote nodes.

904
01:29:10,481 --> 01:29:12,983
- They're going for the kernel.
- Colonel who?

905
01:29:13,108 --> 01:29:15,152
The command processor. The brain!

906
01:29:15,277 --> 01:29:17,362
Cancer, brain. Brain cancer!

907
01:29:18,030 --> 01:29:19,156
What's going on?

908
01:29:19,281 --> 01:29:21,658
In short, Duke, a shitstorm.

909
01:29:23,702 --> 01:29:25,579
Move! Go!

910
01:30:06,745 --> 01:30:08,330
I found it!

911
01:30:09,039 --> 01:30:10,332
I found it!

912
01:30:34,898 --> 01:30:37,359
This is the end, my friend.

913
01:30:39,027 --> 01:30:40,320
Thank you for calling.

914
01:30:43,907 --> 01:30:44,950
Shit!

915
01:30:45,117 --> 01:30:46,410
He got me!

916
01:30:47,077 --> 01:30:48,328
Joey's getting stupid busy.

917
01:30:49,830 --> 01:30:53,333
Joey, go after the worm.
You're the closest.

918
01:30:54,835 --> 01:30:58,338
It's root, slash, period, 'workspace',

919
01:30:58,464 --> 01:31:01,216
slash, period, 'garbage', period.

920
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:06,054
Out of the way!

921
01:31:09,475 --> 01:31:11,769
Out of the way! Freeze!

922
01:31:15,773 --> 01:31:16,773
Come on!

923
01:31:42,466 --> 01:31:43,466
All right! Wow!

924
01:31:45,052 --> 01:31:46,136
Kill the Gibson!

925
01:31:46,261 --> 01:31:47,262
Roger that.

926
01:31:53,227 --> 01:31:56,188
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Is that all you got?

927
01:31:56,772 --> 01:31:59,191
Come on! Let's see what else you can do.

928
01:31:59,316 --> 01:32:04,238
You talking to me, huh?
Are you nuts? Come at me!

929
01:32:07,950 --> 01:32:09,743
They're in the kernel.

930
01:32:09,868 --> 01:32:11,078
Help me!

931
01:32:13,747 --> 01:32:16,667
The tankers have stopped capsizing.

932
01:32:16,792 --> 01:32:18,544
Ballast tanks emptying.

933
01:32:18,669 --> 01:32:20,129
Should be okay.

934
01:32:33,308 --> 01:32:35,102
Little pissant!

935
01:32:47,489 --> 01:32:48,490
Yes!

936
01:32:50,784 --> 01:32:52,327
Let's get outta here!

937
01:32:52,453 --> 01:32:53,453
Freeze!

938
01:33:13,265 --> 01:33:15,476
They're trashing our rights, man.

939
01:33:15,642 --> 01:33:18,645
They're trashing the flow of data.

940
01:33:18,812 --> 01:33:19,980
Trashing!

941
01:33:20,272 --> 01:33:21,356
Trashing!

942
01:33:21,648 --> 01:33:22,649
Trashing!

943
01:33:23,567 --> 01:33:25,277
Hack the planet!

944
01:33:25,569 --> 01:33:27,446
- Hack the planet!
- Shut up and get in!

945
01:33:27,613 --> 01:33:29,406
Hack the planet!

946
01:33:29,656 --> 01:33:30,991
Hack the planet!

947
01:33:38,707 --> 01:33:40,918
- Hello.
- We caught them.

948
01:33:41,085 --> 01:33:42,961
- Good.
- Red-handed.

949
01:33:43,921 --> 01:33:46,131
You won't be having
any more trouble from them.

950
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:04,149
Me, all right? I did it.
She knows shit about computers.

951
01:34:05,859 --> 01:34:07,569
She's just my girlfriend.

952
01:34:10,406 --> 01:34:12,866
I suggest you modify your attitude,

953
01:34:12,991 --> 01:34:14,701
because you are floating

954
01:34:14,827 --> 01:34:16,620
and I am about to flush your ass.

955
01:34:18,288 --> 01:34:21,458
Mrs Murphy is here to see you, sir.

956
01:34:28,757 --> 01:34:31,718
- Are you crazy? What are you doing?
- Trying to help you.

957
01:34:38,225 --> 01:34:39,935
- Dade.
- What?

958
01:34:41,311 --> 01:34:42,396
Thanks for your help.

959
01:34:48,902 --> 01:34:51,029
Your son is in big trouble.

960
01:34:51,363 --> 01:34:55,743
He violated his probation and
has engaged in criminal activities.

961
01:34:56,618 --> 01:34:58,829
My son happens to be a genius.

962
01:34:58,954 --> 01:35:03,083
He understands things that you won't
comprehend if you live to be 100.

963
01:35:03,208 --> 01:35:05,836
He would never use his knowledge
to harm others.

964
01:35:05,961 --> 01:35:08,005
The news crew you requested is here.

965
01:35:08,130 --> 01:35:10,257
Good. I have some things to tell them.

966
01:35:10,507 --> 01:35:14,344
Your son is facing 30 felony counts
in an ongoing investigation.

967
01:35:14,511 --> 01:35:16,889
You face arrest if you do that.

968
01:35:17,014 --> 01:35:18,807
I don't care if I face certain death.

969
01:35:18,932 --> 01:35:21,643
Mrs Murphy stays right here.

970
01:35:23,687 --> 01:35:25,564
Wow. She's great.

971
01:35:27,066 --> 01:35:28,066
Yeah.

972
01:35:30,402 --> 01:35:31,570
..and attacked the Ellingson network.

973
01:35:31,737 --> 01:35:34,823
Is this the last we've seen
of this kind of espionage?

974
01:35:35,991 --> 01:35:39,078
No. Hackers are a grave threat
to the national security.

975
01:35:39,203 --> 01:35:42,164
This incident just proves
that we need

976
01:35:42,289 --> 01:35:44,833
- increased funding to stop...
- We're getting interference.

977
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,294
Hola, boys and girls.
It is I, Cereal Killer,

978
01:35:47,419 --> 01:35:52,591
making my first worldwide
global television appearance.

979
01:35:53,175 --> 01:35:55,427
Yes, that's right.

980
01:35:55,594 --> 01:35:59,098
I'm here to tell you about this heinous
scheme hatched within Ellingson Mineral.

981
01:36:00,182 --> 01:36:01,182
But for what?

982
01:36:01,183 --> 01:36:03,727
World domination? Nay.

983
01:36:03,894 --> 01:36:07,189
Something far more tacky.

984
01:36:07,648 --> 01:36:13,404
A virus called da Vinci, that would cause
Ellingson tankers to capsize,

985
01:36:13,529 --> 01:36:18,242
was to be blamed on innocent hackers.
This virus was really a smokescreen.

986
01:36:18,367 --> 01:36:25,207
What could be so important to protect
that someone would create such a nasty,

987
01:36:25,332 --> 01:36:28,168
anti-social, uncool virus program?

988
01:36:28,293 --> 01:36:29,378
But why?

989
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:32,464
Could it be to cover the tracks
of this worm program?

990
01:36:32,589 --> 01:36:35,676
A worm that was to steal 25 million bucks.

991
01:36:35,926 --> 01:36:38,846
The password for this worm
belongs to Margo Wallace,

992
01:36:38,971 --> 01:36:42,015
- head of Public Relations at Ellingson.
- Oh, my God!

993
01:36:42,141 --> 01:36:44,059
And Eugene Belford,

994
01:36:44,184 --> 01:36:47,688
- computer security officer.
- Son of a bitch!

995
01:36:48,355 --> 01:36:53,235
What's this? The account in the Bahamas
where the money was to be stashed?

996
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:54,445
I think so.

997
01:36:54,570 --> 01:36:56,321
Unlucky!

998
01:36:58,198 --> 01:36:59,366
Yo.

999
01:36:59,491 --> 01:37:01,368
I kinda feel like God.

1000
01:37:06,582 --> 01:37:07,916
Plague?

1001
01:37:10,419 --> 01:37:11,420
Eugene?

1002
01:37:21,847 --> 01:37:27,561
I don't even know how to work the VCR
let alone a computer. Get off!

1003
01:37:27,686 --> 01:37:33,525
Listen, I’ll make a deal. Eugene Belford.
I know where his mother is.

1004
01:37:33,650 --> 01:37:36,111
Get off me! I need a lawyer!

1005
01:37:46,705 --> 01:37:48,665
Here you are, Mr Babbage.

1006
01:37:48,791 --> 01:37:52,878
Flight time to Tokyo is 14 hours.
Can I get you anything else?

1007
01:37:53,003 --> 01:37:55,380
Just a pillow, please.

1008
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:02,805
Thank you.

1009
01:38:05,265 --> 01:38:07,101
You're welcome.

1010
01:38:07,226 --> 01:38:09,937
What's going on? Let go of me!
Stewardess!

1011
01:38:10,062 --> 01:38:12,773
I’ll never fly this airline again!

1012
01:38:23,325 --> 01:38:25,452
You look good in a dress.

1013
01:38:26,537 --> 01:38:28,414
You would have looked better.

1014
01:38:35,170 --> 01:38:37,047
Wanna go for a swim?

1015
01:38:47,766 --> 01:38:50,769
I can't believe they decided you won.

1016
01:38:51,770 --> 01:38:56,150
They didn't. The guys felt it was
the only way I’d get a date.

1017
01:38:59,361 --> 01:39:00,529
Anyway,

1018
01:39:02,322 --> 01:39:04,032
you're pretty good.

1019
01:39:04,408 --> 01:39:05,868
You're elite.

1020
01:39:07,619 --> 01:39:08,787
Yeah?

1021
01:39:09,329 --> 01:39:14,042
If you'd said that at the start,
you would have avoided a lot of trouble.

1022
01:39:26,138 --> 01:39:27,598
Beat that!

1023
01:39:41,195 --> 01:39:42,404
You know,

1024
01:39:44,364 --> 01:39:48,285
- I’ve been having these weird...
- ..dreams.
