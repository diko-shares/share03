No, sir. He was dropped about
15 miles inland near Neuville.

even survived the jump,

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.480
Instead they mis-dropped, scattered
all their sticks into the wind.

- Yes, sir. Sector four is secure.

We...

307
00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:26.980
We took out towed 88s
here, here and here.

308
00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:28.730
They'd already gotten four
of our Shermans

309
00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:30.110
and a number
of our deuce and a halves.

310
00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:33.150
These two minefields
are actually one big one.

311
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:34.900
We tried to make our way up
through the middle of it,

312
00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:37.360
but it turned into a mixed,
high-density field,

313
00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:38.570
little bit of everything.

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:42.490

pot mines. A-200s,

the little wooden bastards
that the mine detectors don't pick up.

316
00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:50.630
This road here, they placed
big mushrooms, Teller Mine 43s,

317
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:51.880
I guess for our tanks,

318
00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:55.460
from here right up
to the edge of the village. Right here.

319

called the engineers.

321
00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:01.180
We had higher
support expectations, sir.

322

company without artillery.

324

325
00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:12.270
We turned them over
to MPs from the 29th.

326
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:17.320
What about our casualties?

327
00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:20.070
Well, the figures

328
00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:24.950
were 35 dead, times two wounded.

329
00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:28.290
They just didn't wanna
give up those 88s.

330
00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:32.960
It was a tough assignment.
That's why you got it.

331
00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.550
Yes, sir.

332
00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.300

333
00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:42.180

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.870
HORVATH: It's not gonna be easy
finding one particular soldier

344
00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.120
in the middle of this
whole goddamn war.

345
00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:14.670
Like finding a needle
in a stack of needles.

346
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:16.340
But what about the company?

347
00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:19.720
We take the pick of the litter
and the rest get folded into Baker.

348
00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.510
Jesus Christ.

349
00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:23.640
They took away your company?

350
00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:28.220
It wasn't my company. It was
the Army's. So they told me, anyway.

351
00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:32.270
Give me Reiben on BAR, Jackson,
Wade, Beasley and Caparzo.

352
00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:33.770
Beasley's dead.

353
00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:36.650
All right, Mellish, then.
We got anybody speaks French?

354
00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:40.570
- Not that I know of.
- What about Talbot?

355
00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:43.700
- This morning.
- Oh. All right.

356
00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:46.200
I'm gonna go try to dig up
another interpreter.

357

on the beach.

- Sarge, what we gonna do?
- Okay, listen up...

360
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:52.120
- What?
- What are we gonna do?

361
00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:53.970
You're going home wrapped
in an American flag

362
00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.040

in your ass, Caparzo, you smart ass.

363
00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:57.880
- Now, listen up.
- I thought you liked it in the ass.

364
00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.680
- What?
- I thought you liked it in the ass.

365
00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.090
Attention!

366
00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:03.430
As you were.

367
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:05.590
I'm looking
for Corporal Upham, Timothy E.

368
00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.010
Yes, sir. I'm Upham, sir.

369
00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:08.720
I understand you speak
French and German.

370
00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:10.600
- Yes, sir.
- How's your accent?

371
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.350
Just a slight one in French,
but my German's clean.

372
00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:14.150
- Has a touch of Bavarian, sir.
- Very good.

373
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:15.770
You've been reassigned to me.
Grab your gear.

374
00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.230
- We're going to a place called Neuville.
- Yes, sir.

375
00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.480
- When was this updated?
- Updated as of 0830 hour this morning.

376
00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:22.820
- Sir...
- This is the 12th SS Panzer.

377
00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:24.740
These are the two axes
that advance south.

378
00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.280
- Sir, there are Germans in Neuville.
- There are artillery up here, sir.

379
00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:30.080
- That's what I understand. Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

380
00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.330
Sir, there are a lot
of Germans in Neuville.

381
00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:33.500
You have a problem with that, Corporal?

382
00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:36.040
No, sir. Just if you consider
I've never been in combat, sir.

383
00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:37.760
I make maps and I translate.
And that's...

384
00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:40.750
I need someone who speaks
French and German.

385
00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:42.590
- Yes, sir.
- My two guys were killed.

386
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:45.340
Yes, sir. It's just that I haven't
held a weapon since basic training, sir.

387
00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:48.050
Did you fire the weapon
in basic training?

388
00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:49.350
Yes, sir.

389
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:52.180
- Well, then, get your gear.
- Yes, sir.

390
00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:55.600
Sir, may I bring...

391
00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.860
May I bring my typewriter, sir?

392
00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:08.280
Yes, sir.

393
00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:13.330
Thank you very much, sir.

394
00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:15.790
- That a souvenir?
- No, sir.

395
00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:18.040
Take your time, Corporal.

396
00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:24.920
You should look
on the bright side of things, Corporal.

397
00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:26.130
Yes, sir.

398
00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:29.260
For one thing,
you don't need to carry those.

399
00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:32.310
- You'll need that.
- I'll need that, sir. Yes, sir.

I was just wondering
where you're from, that's...

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:51.890
- Caparzo, is it?
- Hey, drop dead, Corporal.

408
00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:53.100
Got you.

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:55.390
And another thing.
Every time you salute the captain,

410
00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:57.680
you make him a target for the Germans.

411
00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:59.560
So do us a favor. Don't do it.

412
00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.600
Especially when I'm standing
next to him, <i>capisci?</i>

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.730

414
00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:07.530
- Hey. Watch your rifle.
- Sorry.

415
00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:08.860
Actually, it's about the...

416
00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:10.400
It's supposed to be about
the bonds of brotherhood

417
00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:12.410
that develop between
soldiers during war.

418
00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:14.570

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:21.540
Why don't you ask
the captain where he's from?

422
00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:26.000
Yeah, ask the captain. He'll tell you
everything you wanna know about him.

423
00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:28.260
You wanna explain
the math of this to me?

424
00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:30.630

of risking the lives of the eight of us

supposed to mean, Corporal, huh?

435
00:42:57.370 --> 00:42:59.040
We're all supposed to die. Is that it?

436
00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.870
Upham's talking about

437

- Yes, sir.
- We all have orders we have to follow.

And that supersedes everything,
including your mothers.

Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

the mission's FUBAR, sir?

Especially if you think
the mission's FUBAR.

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:18.310
- What's FUBAR?
- Oh, it's German. Yeah.

443
00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:20.970
Never heard of that.

444
00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:24.350
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.

445
00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:28.060
Well, by all means,
share it with the squad.

446
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:30.360
Well, from my way of thinking, sir,

447
00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:32.820
this entire mission
is a serious mis-allocation

448
00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:35.320
of valuable military resources.

449
00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:37.320
Yeah. Go on.

450
00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:39.870
Well, it seems to me, sir,
that God gave me a special gift,

451
00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:43.250
made me a fine instrument of warfare.

452
00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:46.040

Now, this is the way to gripe!

Continue, Jackson.

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.380
Well, what I mean by that, sir,

455
00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:52.170
is if you was to put me
and this here sniper rifle anywhere,

456
00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:55.010
up to and including one mile
of Adolf Hitler

Oh, that's brilliant, bumpkin.

460
00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:05.270
So, Captain, what about you?
I mean, you don't gripe at all?

461
00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:07.770
I don't gripe to you, Reiben.
I'm a captain.

Gripes go up, not down. Always up.

You gripe to me,

464
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:15.780
I gripe to my superior officers,
so on, so on and so on.

465
00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:17.660
I don't gripe to you.
I don't gripe in front of you.

466
00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:19.740
You should know that as a Ranger.

467
00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:21.700
I'm sorry, sir, but...

468
00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:24.620
Let's say you weren't a captain,
or maybe I was a major.

469
00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:26.500
What would you say then?

470
00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:28.380
Well, in that case,

471
00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:30.540
I'd say this is an
excellent mission, sir,

valuable objective, sir,

00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:48.250
- Yes, sir!
- And get Ryan up here.

677
00:59:50.590 --> 00:59:53.510
LIEUTENANT: Ryan! Ryan,
front and center!

678
00:59:54.010 --> 00:59:55.300
Ryan!

679
00:59:58.970 --> 01:00:00.970
Here comes our boy.

680
01:00:08.770 --> 01:00:11.480
Told you he was an asshole.

681
01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:15.110
- Sir, Private Ryan reporting as ordered.
- At ease.

682
01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:19.030
Captain Miller, 2nd Rangers.
He wants a word with you.

683
01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:22.160
This way.

684
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.790
All right. Take a knee.

685
01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:38.680
Private, I'm afraid
I have some bad news for you.

686
01:00:46.350 --> 01:00:50.060
Well, there isn't any real
easy way to say this, so...

687
01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:55.690
So I'll just say it.
Your brothers are dead.

688
01:00:57.110 --> 01:01:00.870
We have orders to come get you

689
01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:04.040
because you're going home.

690
01:01:17.970 --> 01:01:20.590
Oh, my God. My brothers are dead.

691
01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:31.690
(CRYING) I was supposed to
take them fishing when we got home.

692
01:01:34.570 --> 01:01:36.240
(RYAN SNIFFLING)

693
01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:48.580
MILLER: I'm so sorry, James.
I can't tell you how much.

694
01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:54.250
- How... How did they die?
- They were killed in action.

695
01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:59.680
That can't be. They're...

696
01:02:00.430 --> 01:02:04.390
That... That can't be.
My brothers are still in grammar school.

697
01:02:07.770 --> 01:02:10.730
- You're James Ryan?
- Yeah.

698
01:02:11.850 --> 01:02:14.610
James Francis Ryan from Iowa?

699
01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:17.650
James Frederick Ryan, Minnesota.

700
01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:26.830
What? Does that mean
my brothers are okay?

701
01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:28.620
Yeah, I'm sure they're fine.

702
01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:30.500
Are you sure they're okay, though?

703
01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:32.000
We're looking
for a different Private Ryan.

704
01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:34.080
This is just a big foul-up.

705
01:02:34.170 --> 01:02:36.050
How do you know?
How can you be sure?

706
01:02:36.130 --> 01:02:40.260
How do you know the foul-up isn't
that his brothers are okay and that...

707
01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:42.510
Lieutenant, I'm sorry for the trouble.

708
01:02:42.590 --> 01:02:46.760
I just wrote them a letter right
before I left. I got to get home.

709
01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:50.020
I got to get home right now.

710
01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.600
- I wanna go home.
- SOLDIER: Easy, now.

711
01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.060
- So, where in the hell is our Ryan?
- I don't know.

712
01:02:55.150 --> 01:02:57.230
Are you in touch with your CO?

713
01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:59.190
- That figures.
- What unit's your Ryan in?

714
01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.490
Baker Company, 506th.

715
01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:03.110
The guy with the broken foot,
he's 506, right?

716
01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.870
Yeah. Charlie, I think.

717
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:06.620
- You think?
- Yeah.

718
01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:09.950
Ryan? Don't know... Man!

719
01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:12.620
- MILLER: Where was your drop zone?
- Just inside of Vierville.

720
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:15.580
MILLER: Vierville? How the hell did you
end up way up here?

721
01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:18.920
You got me, sir. C-47 took heavy fire.

722
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.760
Pilot went crazy trying to get out
of there, turning every which way.

723
01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:25.800
Took more fire on the drop.
Got messy. I ended up here.

724
01:03:25.890 --> 01:03:27.930
I haven't seen a single guy
from my stick, sir.

725
01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:29.430
God knows where they are.

726
01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:31.230
Anybody from Baker Company
have, like, a big mouth?

727
01:03:31.310 --> 01:03:33.100
Talk about where the drop zone
might've been?

728
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:36.690
No, sir, but I know Baker Company
had the same rally point as us.

729
01:03:36.770 --> 01:03:38.020
Show me.

730
01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:40.440
My men are beat.

731
01:03:40.530 --> 01:03:42.490
We're gonna hold up here
for about three hours.

732
01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:45.110
We'll pull out after dark.

733
01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:48.120
Got anything left in this town
like a three-star hotel?

734
01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:51.410
Something with clean sheets
and soft pillows and room service?

735
01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:54.960
- How about a nice, comfy church?
- We'll take that.

736
01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:57.880
What have you heard?
How's it all falling together?

737
01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.590
Well, we got the beachhead secure.

738
01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:02.300
Problem is Monty's taking
his time moving on Caen.

739
01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:04.630
We can't pull out till he's ready, so...

740
01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:07.340
- That guy's overrated.
- No argument here.

741
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:10.220
You gotta take Caen,
so you can take Saint-LG.

742
01:04:10.310 --> 01:04:12.220
You got to take Saint-LG
to take Valognes.

743
01:04:12.310 --> 01:04:13.980
Valognes, you got Cherbourg.

744
01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:17.400
- Cherbourg, you got Paris.
- Paris, you get Berlin.

745
01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:20.230
And then that big boat home.

746
01:04:23.570 --> 01:04:25.110
We sure as hell
could use you around here,

747
01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:27.410
but I understand what you're doing.

748
01:04:27.490 --> 01:04:29.120
- You do?
- Yeah.

749
01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:31.830
I got a couple of brothers myself.

750
01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:34.910
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

751
01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:39.250
No, I mean it. Find him. Get him home.

752
01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:49.680
HORVATH: What's with your hand?

753
01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:52.970
I don't know.

754
01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:56.020
It started in Portsmouth

755
01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:57.770
when they brought us
down for embarkation.

756
01:04:57.900 --> 01:04:59.350
It comes and goes.

757
01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:02.360
Well, you may have to get
yourself a new line of work.

758
01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:05.820
This one doesn't seem
to agree with you anymore.

759
01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:09.820
(LAUGHING)

760
01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:12.450
What?

761
01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.670
- What?
- Nothing.

762
01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:22.210
What was the name
of that kid at Anzio?

763
01:05:22.290 --> 01:05:24.800
The one that was always walking
around on his hands, you know?

764
01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:28.510
And he was singing that song
about the man on the flying trapeze.

765
01:05:28.590 --> 01:05:30.300
- Vecchio.
- Vecchio.

766
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:32.050
(BOTH LAUGHING)

767
01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:38.230
Yeah, Vecchio.

768
01:05:38.310 --> 01:05:40.190
He was a goofy kid.

769
01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:44.940
Remember, he used to pee
a "V" on everybody's jacket

770
01:05:45.030 --> 01:05:48.320
for Vecchio, for victory.

771
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:56.700
MILLER: He was so short.
He was a midget, wasn't he?

772
01:05:56.790 --> 01:05:59.540
"How did you get to be a Ranger?"

773
01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:02.040
HORVATH: He got shot in the foot once,
didn't he,

774
01:06:02.130 --> 01:06:03.130
when he was walking on his hands?

775
01:06:03.210 --> 01:06:06.170
MILLER: Yeah. He could walk
faster on his hands.

776
01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:10.340
He could run faster on his hands than...

777
01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:14.640
Vecchio.

778
01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:17.020
Yeah.

779
01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:20.020
Caparzo.

780
01:06:26.530 --> 01:06:31.450
You see, when you end up
killing one of your men,

781
01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:35.450
you tell yourself it happened

782
01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:41.170
so you could save the lives
of two or three or 10 others.

783
01:06:42.830 --> 01:06:44.880
Maybe 100 others.

784
01:06:49.090 --> 01:06:52.050
Do you know how many men
I've lost under my command?

785
01:06:52.130 --> 01:06:54.390
- How many?
- Ninety-four.

786
01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:01.560
But that means I've saved the lives
of 10 times that many, doesn't it?

787
01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:05.940
Maybe even 20, right?
Twenty times as many?

788
01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:14.410
And that's how simple it is.

789
01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:17.030
That's how you...

790
01:07:18.370 --> 01:07:21.040
That's how you rationalize
making the choice

791
01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.620
between the mission and the men.

792
01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:27.170
Except this time, the mission is a man.

793
01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:32.930
This Ryan better be worth it.

794
01:07:35.930 --> 01:07:38.720
He'd better go home,
cure some disease,

795
01:07:38.810 --> 01:07:42.310
or invent a longer-lasting
light bulb or something.

796
01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:44.860
'Cause the truth is
I wouldn't trade 10 Ryans

797
01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:47.690
for one Vecchio or one Caparzo.

798
01:07:47.770 --> 01:07:49.110
Amen.

799
01:07:51.490 --> 01:07:53.610
Look. There it goes again.

800
01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:57.620
Sir, are you all right?

801
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:06.170
Now, look, we're gonna
move out in two hours.

802
01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:08.540
Why don't you get some sleep?

803
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:11.670
REIBEN: I don't know how he does it.
MELLISH: What's that?

804
01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:14.420
Falls asleep like that.
I mean, look at him.

805
01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:17.550
The guy's lights out the minute
his head hits the pack.

806
01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:19.220
Clear conscience.

807
01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:20.890
Yeah. What's that saying?

808
01:08:20.970 --> 01:08:24.140
"If God's on our side,
who the hell could be on theirs?"

809
01:08:24.230 --> 01:08:26.810
"If God be for us,
who could be against us?"

810
01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:29.020
REIBEN: Yeah, what did I say?

811
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:33.360
WADE: Well, actually, the trick to
falling asleep is trying to stay awake.

812
01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:35.240
How is that, Wade?

813
01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:40.280
Well, when my mother was an intern,
she used to work late through the night,

814
01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:42.910
sleep through the day.

815
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.830
So the only time that we ever got
to talk about anything

816
01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:46.370
was when she'd get home.

817
01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:49.000
So what I used to do,
I used to lie in my bed

818
01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:50.590
and try to stay awake
as long as I could,

819
01:08:50.670 --> 01:08:54.420
but it never worked
'cause the harder I tried,

820
01:08:54.510 --> 01:08:56.720
the faster I'd fall asleep.

821
01:08:58.090 --> 01:09:00.100
REIBEN: Yeah. Well, that wouldn't have
mattered none in my house.

822
01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:02.310
My ma, she would've come home,
shook me awake,

823
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:04.220
chatted me up till dawn.

824
01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:06.850
I swear, that woman
was never too tired to talk.

825
01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:10.940
Yeah. That's probably the only time
she could get a word in.

826
01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:18.530
Funny thing is,
sometimes she'd come home early,

827
01:09:18.610 --> 01:09:21.280
and I'd pretend to be asleep.

828
01:09:21.370 --> 01:09:25.000
- MELLISH: Who? Your mum?
- Yeah.

829
01:09:27.710 --> 01:09:30.710
She'd stand in the doorway,
looking at me.

830
01:09:31.170 --> 01:09:33.590
And I'd just keep my eyes shut.

831
01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:39.970
And I knew she just wanted
to find out about my day,

832
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:43.010
that she came home early

833
01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:46.390
just to talk to me.

834
01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:53.820
And I still wouldn't move.
I'd still pretend to just be asleep.

835
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:03.330
I don't know why I did that.

836
01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:20.470
MILLER: We only got a couple of hours.
Shut up and go to sleep.

837
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:32.100
Captain? Sir?

838
01:10:34.150 --> 01:10:35.610
Corporal?

839
01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:43.910
How you doing there? Are you all right?

840
01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:47.080
Yeah, I think this is
all good for me, sir.

841
01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:49.960
Really?

842
01:10:50.710 --> 01:10:52.210
How is that?

843
01:10:56.130 --> 01:10:58.670
"War educates the senses,"

844
01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:00.720
"calls into action the will,"

845
01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:03.510
"perfects the physical constitution,"

846
01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:06.760
"brings men into such swift
and close collision"

847
01:11:06.850 --> 01:11:09.980
"in critical moments
that man measures man."

848
01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:13.150
Yeah. Well, I guess
that's Emerson's way

849
01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:15.400
of finding the bright side.

850
01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:19.150
- You know Emerson, sir?
- I know some.

851
01:11:23.610 --> 01:11:27.660
So, where are you from, Captain?
What'd you do before the war?

852
01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:32.000
What's the pool up to?

853
01:11:35.330 --> 01:11:38.170
You know, I think it's around 300, sir.

854
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.670
Well, when it gets up to 500,

855
01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:44.010
I'll give you the answers,
and we'll split the money.

856
01:11:44.090 --> 01:11:46.090
How about that?

857
01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:49.760
Well, if that's the way you feel, sir.
I feel it's my duty under your command

858
01:11:49.850 --> 01:11:54.100
to suggest that we wait
until it gets up to 1,000, sir.

859
01:11:55.810 --> 01:11:58.320
What if we don't live that long?

860
01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:04.570
- 500?
- 500 would be good, yeah.

861
01:12:04.650 --> 01:12:06.620
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

862
01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:12.000
- Get some sleep, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

863
01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:24.340
(DISTANT EXPLOSIONS)

864
01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:20.810
SOLDIER 1: Who's got sulfa powder?

865
01:13:23.190 --> 01:13:27.360
Medic! My buddy's bleeding!
He needs a tourniquet!

866
01:13:27.450 --> 01:13:28.950
- Wade.
- Yes, sir?

867
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:30.990
- See what you can do.
- Yes, sir.

868
01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:34.410
Hold on, fellas. It
won't be much longer.

869
01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:36.450
How we doing here?

870
01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.370
All right.

871
01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:41.000
Yeah, doing all right.
Don't worry about it.

872
01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:42.840
Doc's in town.

873
01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:44.380
It's all right. It's all right.

874
01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:45.960
Don't worry, fellas.

875
01:13:46.050 --> 01:13:48.590
The 29th Infantry's breaking through,
they'll be here soon.

876
01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:51.050
SOLDIER 1: Plasma.
Anybody got plasma?

877
01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:54.970
- Captain. Hey, Captain.
- Soldier, you want to fill me in?

878
01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:57.020
Yeah. Lieutenant DeWindt, sir.

879
01:13:57.100 --> 01:14:00.730
99th Troop Carrier Squadron,
carrying in 327th Glider Infantry.

880
01:14:00.810 --> 01:14:02.400
This one was mine, sir.

881
01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:03.900
- I was the pilot.
- Private?

882
01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:05.480
- Twenty-two men dead.
- Private, take care of...

883
01:14:05.570 --> 01:14:08.400
I ended up over there without a scratch.
It took my co-pilot's head right off.

884
01:14:08.490 --> 01:14:10.110
Well, where's the unit?
Who are these people?

885
01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:13.200
Well, the guys we came in with, sir,
they headed off first night.

886
01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:14.580
Haven't seen them since.

887
01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:18.710
Meantime, other guys keep showing up,
one, two, half-dozen at a time.

888
01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:21.580
Then some officer'll come along
and patch together a mixed unit,

889
01:14:21.670 --> 01:14:22.870
head off to make trouble, sir.

890
01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.130
SOLDIER 2: Water.
I need a canteen over here.

891
01:14:24.210 --> 01:14:26.210
We're looking for a Private James Ryan.

892
01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:28.550
He's in Baker Company,
the 506 of the 101st.

893
01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:30.970
No, you got me, sir.
A lot of guys come in and out of here.

894
01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:32.510
- Upham.
- Yes, sir.

895
01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:34.430
Check out that squad.
See if Ryan's in it.

896
01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:36.180
Yes, sir.

897
01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:39.020
Reiben.

898
01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:43.560
Smell that leg right there.
Find out if it's south of cheese.

899
01:14:49.190 --> 01:14:50.530
WADE: What?

900
01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:53.490
<i>Juden.</i>

901
01:14:55.410 --> 01:14:57.370
- Juden.
- SOLDIER: Keep moving.

902
01:14:57.450 --> 01:14:59.330
- Keep moving!
- Juden.

903
01:15:00.250 --> 01:15:02.620
<i>I'm Juden, you know?</i>

904
01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:07.460
Yeah, I couldn't pry him out of there,
hard as I tried.

905
01:15:07.550 --> 01:15:09.760
- I'd need a winch.
- Yeah.

906
01:15:13.890 --> 01:15:15.180
HORVATH: Stars.

907
01:15:15.550 --> 01:15:20.100
Yep, Brigadier General Amend,
Deputy Commander, 101st.

908
01:15:20.930 --> 01:15:23.480
Some fucking genius had the great idea

909
01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.110
of welding a couple of steel plates

910
01:15:25.190 --> 01:15:28.480
onto our deck to keep
the general safe from ground fire.

911
01:15:28.570 --> 01:15:30.150
Unfortunately,
they forgot to tell me about it

912
01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:32.650
until we were just getting airborne.

913
01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:35.740
Well, that's like trying
to fly a freight train. Okay.

914
01:15:36.370 --> 01:15:39.740
Gross overload.
Trim characteristics all shot to hell.

915
01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:43.120
I nearly broke both my arms
trying to keep her level.

916
01:15:43.210 --> 01:15:45.330
(STAMMERING) And when we released,

917
01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:47.710
you know, I out as hard as I could,

918
01:15:47.790 --> 01:15:51.300
tried to gain some altitude
and still keep her from stalling.

919
01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:55.550
We came down like a fucking meteor.
And this is how we ended up.

920
01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:01.020
And the others, they stopped easy
enough okay though, you know?

921
01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:04.850
We were just... We were just
too damn heavy, you know?

922
01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:06.770
The grass was wet.

923
01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:09.730
Downward slope and all.

924
01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:12.360
Twenty-two guys dead.

925
01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:18.660
- All that for a general?
- One man.

926
01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:24.210
- A lot of that going around.
- FUBAR.

927
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:26.790
- FUBAR.
- FUBAR.

928
01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:28.960
FUBAR.

929
01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:31.170
You all got that right.

930
01:16:31.670 --> 01:16:33.630
Hey, I looked up "FUBAR"
in the German dictionary.

931
01:16:33.670 --> 01:16:34.790
There's no "FUBAR"in there.

932
01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:36.050
- MILLER: Upham.
- Yes, sir?

933
01:16:36.130 --> 01:16:38.770
There's more paratroops out there.
Find out if one of them is Ryan.

934
01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:40.220
UPHAM: Yes, sir.

935
01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:42.970
Oh, you might want
to check these out, sir.

936
01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:44.600
Dog tags.

937
01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:47.600
More than I really want to count, sir.

938
01:16:48.810 --> 01:16:51.650
I've covered a lot of bodies, sir.

939
01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:53.190
MILLER: Jackson.

940
01:16:53.820 --> 01:16:56.650
- Start going through those.
- Yes, sir.

941
01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:59.490
I'll help.

942
01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:04.250
What do you think, Jackson? Do you
think that little prick's in there?

943
01:17:04.330 --> 01:17:07.330
Well, if he is, I'm gonna find him.
I bet that son of a bitch is here.

944
01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:09.330
I got big money saying
this guy's still alive.

945
01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:11.540
MELLISH: 10 bucks says I nail him first.

946
01:17:11.630 --> 01:17:14.260
- Let's see who we got in here.
- You mugs don't stand a chance.

947
01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:16.220
All right, you think this little
shit bird is in here or what?

948
01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:18.010
Just keep looking.

949
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:20.640
All right. Gary Ianico.

950
01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.510
Ben Rubino. Mike Cessacchio.

951
01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:24.390
I swear.
All the guineas are buying it, huh?

952
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:26.270
MELLISH: Oh, come on,
not the right name.

953
01:17:26.350 --> 01:17:29.350
Wee Willie Winkie,
that's a buddy of yours.

954
01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:31.980
REIBEN: We gotta find this prick.

955
01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:38.150
Where is this son of a bitch?

956
01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:40.780
Don't mix them up, Jackson, all right?
Keep them in your own fucking pile.

957
01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:43.200
How am I supposed to know
who we got?

958
01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:45.950
Why don't you just shut up,
Reiben? All right.

959
01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:49.540
REIBEN: Everybody be friends.
MELLISH: Cranky there, huh?

960
01:17:50.670 --> 01:17:53.460
- I think I got a winner.
- What you talking about?

961
01:17:53.550 --> 01:17:55.000
Ryan.

962
01:17:55.210 --> 01:17:57.800
- Ryan.
- Take a look at that, Mellish.

963
01:17:58.340 --> 01:17:59.630
You know what?
You're a genius. You really are.

964
01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:01.550
R-I-E-N-N-E.

965
01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:03.600
That's Rienne and that's French.
All right.

966
01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.840
- You know what that means?
- JACKSON: It means nothing.

967
01:18:05.850 --> 01:18:07.810
MELLISH: What beats three of a kind?
JACKSON: I got shit here.

968
01:18:07.890 --> 01:18:11.600
- I got all guys from New York.
- MELLISH: I got a full house.

969
01:18:11.690 --> 01:18:13.820
REIBEN: Do you need a hand with that?
MELLISH: I got a full house.

970
01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:16.540
- I got you beat. I got the straight flush.
- Full house, he's got.

971
01:18:16.570 --> 01:18:19.950
You were looking at my tags.
You're cheating, you know?

972
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:22.160
- Ryan.
- Fucking unreal, this guy.

973
01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:24.830
REIBEN: Do you need a hand with that?
Can you read that shit?

974
01:18:24.910 --> 01:18:27.500
Jesus Christ. Look at this poor bastard.

975
01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:29.290
MELLISH: I guess they're
not bullet-proof, huh?

976
01:18:29.370 --> 01:18:30.670
REIBEN: Guess not. All right'?

977
01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:32.170
I don't like
what he's got between his ears.

978
01:18:32.250 --> 01:18:35.170
JACKSON: Sort of like what you fellas
got between your legs.

979
01:18:35.250 --> 01:18:37.340
MELLISH: We got to give him that.
REIBEN: That's not bad.

980
01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:38.920
Not bad with you, Jackson.

981
01:18:39.010 --> 01:18:41.010
All right, I got three of a kind.
All right.

982
01:18:41.090 --> 01:18:42.260
- Full house.
- What the hell are you doing?

983
01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:44.850
The whole goddamn
Airborne's watching.

984
01:18:44.930 --> 01:18:46.390
These aren't poker chips.

985
01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:50.310
- JACKSON: All right, all right, all right.
- Put them back in there!

986
01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:15.500
He's not here.

987
01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:22.440
Maybe we should bust up
into a couple of different groups, huh?

988
01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:23.680
And wander the woods
like Hansel and Gretel,

989
01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:24.840
calling his name.

990
01:19:24.970 --> 01:19:28.100
He's bound to hear us sooner
or later. Ryan!

991
01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:31.350
That might be
a little hard to do, Captain.

992
01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:34.230
Maybe the locals have seen him.
Hey, you know...

993
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:35.560
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

994
01:19:35.650 --> 01:19:38.440
Ryan? James Ryan?
<i>Merci. Merci beaucoup.</i>

995
01:19:38.650 --> 01:19:41.150
Ryan! Anybody know Ryan,
101st Airborne?

996
01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:45.030
Ryan? You know a guy named Ryan?
Private James Ryan from Iowa?

997
01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:47.160
Anybody know a Ryan?

998
01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:49.580
James Ryan!

999
01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:55.630
Hey, Joe, doesn't Mandelsohn pal
around with a Ryan from C Company?

1000
01:19:55.710 --> 01:19:59.000
- Yeah. I think so.
- Bring him up here, would you?

1001
01:20:08.350 --> 01:20:10.910
- Do you know Private Ryan?
- You're gonna have to speak up, sir.

1002
01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:12.180
(YELLING) You're gonna have to
speak up, sir.

1003
01:20:12.270 --> 01:20:13.940
- My hearing is not good!
- It comes and goes!

1004
01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:15.230
- It comes and goes!
- A German grenade went off

1005
01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:17.150
- next to his ear.
- A grenade went off right by my head!

1006
01:20:17.230 --> 01:20:20.270
Got it, got it. Do you
know Private Ryan?

1007
01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:21.820
Who?

1008
01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:24.360
Private Ryan! James Ryan!

1009
01:20:24.450 --> 01:20:28.660
- Jimmy Ryan?
- James! James Francis Ryan!

1010
01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:32.580
- No, no, no. James Francis Ryan.
- All right. Get me a pencil.

1011
01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:35.000
Something to write on.
Something to write on.

1012
01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.580
Quick! Quick! Come on, a pencil!

1013
01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:41.130
A small one, sir.

1014
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:42.880
Write this down.

1015
01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.920
James Francis Ryan, question mark.

1016
01:20:45.050 --> 01:20:46.800
Iowa, question mark.

1017
01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:49.390
Do you know him? Does he know him?

1018
01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:51.560
Read the message. Look.

1019
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:57.400
- Yeah. Of course I know him, sir.
- Does he know where he is?

1020
01:21:01.230 --> 01:21:04.610
Yeah, yeah. We missed
our drop zone by about 20 miles,

1021
01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:08.030
ended up way over
by Bumville or some damn place.

1022
01:21:08.110 --> 01:21:11.240
Him, me and a couple of other guys
were coming here to the rally point,

1023
01:21:11.330 --> 01:21:16.500
ran into a Colonel who was gathering
up men to go to Ramelle.

1024
01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:17.920
Ramelle.

1025
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.460
To baby-sit a bridge.
That's the last I've seen of him, sir.

1026
01:21:20.590 --> 01:21:22.460
Great! Great! Thank you.

1027
01:21:22.590 --> 01:21:24.840
Write thank... Read, and thank you.

1028
01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:27.430
- MANDELSOHN: You're welcome!
- Assemble on me.

1029
01:21:29.590 --> 01:21:31.600
Thank you, Lieutenant.

1030
01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:35.600
Ramelle.

1031
01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:39.310
We're here. There.

1032
01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:45.030
Ramelle is on the Merderet River,
right here, just to the southwest of us.

1033
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:47.490
You know anything about this bridge
he was talking about, Captain?

1034
01:21:47.610 --> 01:21:51.450
Yep. The target has
always been Cherbourg.

1035
01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:55.700
We can't push on Paris
until we take a deep water port.

1036
01:21:55.790 --> 01:21:57.580
And Rommel knows that,

1037
01:21:57.660 --> 01:21:59.250
so he's gonna try to get his armor

1038
01:21:59.330 --> 01:22:02.710
across the Merderet river
anywhere he can.

1039
01:22:02.790 --> 01:22:04.870
That way, he can hit
our invasion forces in the flank

1040
01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:07.550
when we make
the big right turn to Cherbourg.

1041
01:22:07.630 --> 01:22:09.340
That makes any village on that river

1042
01:22:09.470 --> 01:22:12.720
with an intact bridge
solid gold real estate.

1043
01:22:33.410 --> 01:22:34.830
Let's go.

1044
01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:45.670
MELLISH: Captain.

1045
01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:26.000
HORVATH: What the hell is that?

1046
01:23:27.210 --> 01:23:30.340
MILLER: A radar site.
It's gotta be out of action.

1047
01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:35.220
Looks like we got something in that.
Sandbag bunker right under the station.

1048
01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:39.270
- See it?
- Yeah. That's my guess, too.

1049
01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:42.440
What is it?

1050
01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:45.400
Machine gun. Probably MG42.

1051
01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:47.770
Jesus. Is that what got those guys?

1052
01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:49.780
Maybe one of them's our boy.

1053
01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:53.280
MILLER: No, their patches are 82nd,
so your luck's not that good.

1054
01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:55.450
Yeah, well, I don't know how fast
the rest of you betties are,

1055
01:23:55.530 --> 01:23:58.030
but I'm thinking we detour
this way quick and quiet,

1056
01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:01.160
the krauts will never
even know we were here.

1057
01:24:01.250 --> 01:24:04.830
So, Captain, what I'm trying to say is
why don't we just go around the thing?

1058
01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:08.340
I hear what you're saying,
but we can't go around it.

1059
01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:11.840
I'm with Reiben on this one, sir.

1060
01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:16.050
- I mean, we left them 88s.
- For the Air Force.

1061
01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:20.220
The Air Force isn't gonna spend
ordnance on one machine gun.

1062
01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:22.140
Captain...

1063
01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:25.060
We can still skip it
and accomplish our mission.

1064
01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:28.110
I mean, this isn't our
mission, right, sir?

1065
01:24:28.190 --> 01:24:30.400
Oh. That's what
you want to do, Mellish?

1066
01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:31.940
You just want to leave it here,
so they can ambush

1067
01:24:32.030 --> 01:24:33.390
the next company that comes along?

1068
01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:34.840
No, sir. That's not what I'm saying.

1069
01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:37.660
I'm simply saying
it seems like an unnecessary risk,

1070
01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:39.200
given our objective, sir.

1071
01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:42.040
Our objective is to win the war.

1072
01:24:45.250 --> 01:24:49.250
Sir, I just... I don't have
a good feeling about this one.

1073
01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:55.470
When was the last time
you felt good about anything?

1074
01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:19.530
All right, three runners
with suppressing fire.

1075
01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:22.830
Mellish, you hook to the right.
I'll go up the middle.

1076
01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:24.660
Who's going left?

1077
01:25:31.090 --> 01:25:32.920
Who's going left?

1078
01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:38.760
I'll do it.

1079
01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:42.310
- I'll go left.
- All right.

1080
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:45.180
Upham, switch off with Jackson,
and you linger in the rear.

1081
01:25:45.270 --> 01:25:46.730
Yes, sir.

1082
01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:52.270
We advance and keep pressure on him
till he has to change out his barrels.

1083
01:25:53.110 --> 01:25:55.070
I think we should be able
to hit him from grenade range.

1084
01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:59.450
- Maybe I should go up the middle, sir.
- The way you run? I don't think so.

1085
01:25:59.530 --> 01:26:03.280
- Maybe I should go left, sir.
- Maybe you should shut up.

1086
01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:06.450
Reiben, base of fire.

1087
01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:17.760
Mags and clips where
you can reach them, and...

1088
01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:20.800
And extra grenades
for the base runners.

Get up here!

of the extra medical kit!

- More sulfa, Mellish.
- HORVATH: I got him. I got him, Wade.

- You're gonna be all right.
- Listen to my voice.

- I guess it just skinned the arm, sir.
- Get it cleaned and dressed.

1173
01:32:45.190 --> 01:32:48.230
Sir? Sir, you're gonna
let them kill him?

1174
01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:53.490
- This is not right, sir.
- You can help him with the bodies.

1175
01:32:55.820 --> 01:32:57.660
What is happening?

1176
01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:49.520
American.

1177
01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:53.190
I like American.

- Yeah. That's what you think.

01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:23.140
Come on. Yeah.

1185
01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:36.440
Please... I like America.

1186
01:35:37.770 --> 01:35:39.990

Captain.

1199
01:36:35.620 --> 01:36:37.500
Captain, this isn't right.

1200
01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:41.130
You know this. He's a prisoner.
He surrendered.

1201
01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:43.800
He surrendered, sir!

1202
01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:56.190
Tell him

1203
01:36:58.190 --> 01:37:01.530
to march 1,000 paces in that direction,

1204
01:37:01.650 --> 01:37:02.860
then he can take off the blindfold.

1205
01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:04.030
We'll be gone, and he turns himself in

1206
01:37:04.150 --> 01:37:05.950
to the first Allied patrol
he comes across.

1207
01:37:06.030 --> 01:37:07.030
- Thank you, sir.
- REIBEN: You gotta be kidding me.

1208
01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:09.950
- We're letting him go?
- He's a POW, Reiben.

1209
01:37:10.030 --> 01:37:14.370
Can't take him with us.
Our guys'll pick him up sooner or later.

1210

Only if he doesn't get picked up
by his own Wehrmacht first,

1211
01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:30.050
then thrown back into circulation.

1212
01:37:32.220 --> 01:37:34.640
Captain, you just let the enemy go.

1213
01:37:34.730 --> 01:37:37.640
- This is such bullshit.
- Y'all got that right.

1214
01:37:37.730 --> 01:37:39.730
Bullshit? Right. This is bullshit?

1215
01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:41.900
- Shooting a prisoner, that'd be okay?
- Upham, shut your mouth.

1216
01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:43.070
It's against the goddamn rules!

1217
01:37:43.190 --> 01:37:47.240
Yeah. The goddamn rules
just walked off with your new friend.

1218
01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:53.410
But I guess that was
the decent thing to do, huh, Captain?

1219
01:38:00.210 --> 01:38:02.540
Get your gear. Let's go.

1220
01:38:05.010 --> 01:38:07.090
You heard him. Gear up.

1221
01:38:08.430 --> 01:38:10.260
The Captain just gave you an order.

1222
01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:14.180
Yeah. Like the one he gave
to take this machine gun.

1223
01:38:14.260 --> 01:38:17.390
- That was a real doozy, wasn't it, Sarge.
- Soldier, you are way out of line.

1224
01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:20.730
Yes, sir. That was one hell of a call,
coming to take this nest,

1225
01:38:20.810 --> 01:38:23.570
but what the hell? We only lost
one of our guys, going for it.

1226
01:38:23.650 --> 01:38:25.980
I swear, I hope Mama Ryan's
real fucking happy,

1227
01:38:26.110 --> 01:38:29.650
knowing that little Jimmy's life is a little
bit more important than two of our guys!

1228
01:38:29.780 --> 01:38:32.740
But then again, we haven't
found him yet, have we? Huh?

1229
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:36.160
- HORVATH: Here you go.
- Get the hell off me!

1230

HORVATH: Reiben, get up.

1231
01:38:39.790 --> 01:38:42.920
Gear up. Fall in.

1232
01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:50.180
I'm done with this mission.

1233
01:38:55.140 --> 01:38:56.810
Hey! Hey!

1234
01:38:58.770 --> 01:39:00.810
- UPHAM: Sir.
- Don't walk away from your Captain.

1235
01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:03.190
- Reiben, get back in line.
- No, sir.

1236
01:39:03.310 --> 01:39:04.650
I'll spend the rest
of my life in the stockade

1237
01:39:04.770 --> 01:39:06.070
if I have to, but I'm done with this.

1238
01:39:06.150 --> 01:39:08.440
- I'm not gonna ask you again, soldier.
- Captain!

1239
01:39:08.530 --> 01:39:09.860
All right, now. This is bullshit!

1240
01:39:09.990 --> 01:39:12.450
- Fall in!
- You're gonna shoot me over Ryan?

1241
01:39:12.530 --> 01:39:13.910
No. I'm gonna shoot you
'cause I don't like you.

1242
01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:16.950
- UPHAM: Sir, listen...
- Sir, if he wants to go, just let him go!

1243
01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:20.370
Are you letting this happen?
Captain! You see this?

1244
01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:23.540
- Captain? Sir? Sir, Ryan's dead.
- Bullshit!

1245
01:39:23.670 --> 01:39:26.090
- Sir, we have a situation you might...
- That is bullshit!

1246
01:39:26.170 --> 01:39:28.670
Captain, I have a sixth sense about
these things. I know it in my bones.

1247
01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:31.680
We don't kill that son-of-a-bitch kraut.
Now you're gonna shoot me?

1248
01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:34.280
- He's better than you.
- Then why don't you just do it, Sarge?

1249
01:39:34.340 --> 01:39:36.010
Do it, man. Put one in my leg
and give me that...

1250
01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:38.770
I'm gonna shoot you
in your big goddamn mouth!

1251
01:39:38.850 --> 01:39:40.270
Well, put your money
where your mouth is...

1252
01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:41.770
- You don't know when to shut up.
- Do it!

1253
01:39:41.850 --> 01:39:43.440
- You don't know how to shut up.
- Pull the trigger, already!

1254
01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:44.860
Captain, please!

1255
01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:48.190
- What's the pool on me up to?
- What?

1256
01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:51.030
- You are a coward son of a bitch!
- I'm waiting, Sarge.

1257
01:39:51.110 --> 01:39:54.780
Mike, what's the pool
on me up to right now?

1258
01:39:54.870 --> 01:39:56.660
What's it up to?

1259
01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:01.870
What is it, $300? Is that it? 300?
I'm a schoolteacher.

1260
01:40:06.460 --> 01:40:08.710
I teach English composition

1261
01:40:10.050 --> 01:40:12.220
in this little town called
Addley, Pennsylvania.

1262
01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:14.050
The last 11 years,

1263
01:40:14.890 --> 01:40:17.890
I've been at
Thomas Alva Edison High School.

1264
01:40:19.810 --> 01:40:23.480
I was the coach of the baseball team
in the springtime.

1265
01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:27.690
I'll be doggone.

1266
01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:31.650
MILLER: Back home, when I'd tell people
what I do for a living,

1267
01:40:31.740 --> 01:40:34.650
they'd think, "Well, that figures."

1268
01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:38.740
But over here, it's a...

1269
01:40:40.370 --> 01:40:42.040
A big...

1270
01:40:43.290 --> 01:40:44.960
A big mystery...

1271
01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.710
So I guess I've changed some.

1272
01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:54.590
Sometimes I wonder
if I've changed so much

1273
01:40:54.670 --> 01:40:59.220
my wife is even going to recognize me
whenever it is I get back to her.

1274
01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:03.310
And how I'll ever be able to...

1275
01:41:05.850 --> 01:41:08.480
To tell her about days like today.

1276
01:41:11.110 --> 01:41:12.480
Ah! Ryan...

1277
01:41:14.190 --> 01:41:17.360
I don't know anything about Ryan.
I don't care.

1278
01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:21.700
The man means nothing to me,
it's just a name. But if...

1279
01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:26.040
You know, if going to Ramelle

1280
01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:27.710
and finding him, so he can go home,

1281
01:41:27.790 --> 01:41:29.420
if that earns me the right
to get back to my wife

1282
01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:33.800
well, then... Then that's my mission.

1283
01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:37.430
You want to leave?

1284
01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:40.550
You want to go off and fight the war?

1285
01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:44.890
All right.

1286
01:41:46.230 --> 01:41:48.770
All right, I won't stop you.

1287
01:41:48.850 --> 01:41:51.440
I'll even put in the paperwork.

1288
01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:57.780
I just know that every man I kill,
the farther away from home I feel.

We've been expecting a probe.
That must have been it.

James Francis Ryan?

1313
01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:51.260
Yes, sir. How'd you guess that?

1314
01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:05.990
MILLER: Looks like you guys
got hit pretty hard.

1315

HENDERSON: Yes, sir.
Small unit action.

1316
01:46:12.030 --> 01:46:15.620
They came in,
and beat the hell out of us with 88s.

1317
01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:25.380
Tell you what, sir, if you're our
relief, I'm gonna file a complaint.

1318
01:46:25.460 --> 01:46:27.420
I wouldn't blame you.

Who's your CO?

01:46:31.510 --> 01:46:34.310
HENDERSON: It would have been
Captain Jennings, sir.

1321
01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:38.850
I'm afraid the best we can muster up
right now is a corporal.

1322
01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:41.480
So, what are you guys all about?

1323
01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:44.570
We're here for him. Ryan.

Yes, sir.

Yeah. I'm afraid so.

You might want to take
some time with this.

1334
01:47:42.580 --> 01:47:45.630
If there's someplace
you want to go and...

1335
01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:57.560
- What's this all about?
- Ryan lost his brothers.

1336
01:47:57.640 --> 01:48:00.020
- Which one?
- All of them.

1337
01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:06.360
You...

1338
01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:12.280
You came all the way
out here to tell me that?

1339
01:48:13.990 --> 01:48:16.160
Well, you're going home.

1340
01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:20.240
Our orders are to bring you back.

1341
01:48:23.540 --> 01:48:25.170
Bring me back?

1342
01:48:27.540 --> 01:48:31.050
Corporal Henderson, I don't mean
to leave you even more shorthanded,

1343
01:48:31.130 --> 01:48:32.470
but orders are orders.

1344
01:48:32.550 --> 01:48:35.390
Any communication about when
you're going to be relieved up here?

1345
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:36.720
Sir, there's no way to tell. I mean,

1346
01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:38.390
we have no idea
what's happening south of us.

1347
01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:39.810
I have my orders, too, sir.

1348
01:48:39.890 --> 01:48:41.810
They don't include me
abandoning my post.

1349
01:48:41.890 --> 01:48:44.810
I understand that,
but this changes things.

1350
01:48:44.890 --> 01:48:47.230
I don't see that it does, sir.

1351
01:48:48.860 --> 01:48:51.900
The Chief of Staff
for the United States Army says it does.

1352
01:48:51.980 --> 01:48:54.820
Sir, our orders are to hold
this bridge at all cost.

1353
01:48:54.900 --> 01:48:57.410
Now, our planes in the 82nd
have taken out every bridge

1354
01:48:57.530 --> 01:48:59.490
across the Merderet
with the exception of two.

1355
01:48:59.580 --> 01:49:01.160
One at Valognes and this one here.

1356
01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:02.500
We let the Germans take them,

1357
01:49:02.580 --> 01:49:04.160
we're gonna lose our foothold
and have to displace.

1358
01:49:04.250 --> 01:49:07.750
MILLER: Private, your outfit
wants to stay, that's one thing.

1359
01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:08.920
But your party's over here.

1360
01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.170
Sir, I can't leave
until at least reinforcements...

1361
01:49:11.250 --> 01:49:13.670
You got three minutes
to gather your gear.

1362
01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:15.840
Sir, what about them?
I mean, there's barely hardly enough...

1363
01:49:15.930 --> 01:49:17.430
REIBEN: Hey, asshole!

1364
01:49:18.180 --> 01:49:22.060
Two of our guys already died
trying to find you, all right?

1365
01:49:27.100 --> 01:49:29.770
- Sir?
- That's right.

1366
01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:44.160
- What were their names?
- Irwin Wade and Adrian Caparzo.

1367
01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:47.670
Wade and...

1368
01:49:49.170 --> 01:49:50.630
Caparzo.

1369
01:50:03.010 --> 01:50:05.430
(WHISPERS) It doesn't make any sense.

1370
01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:11.770
It doesn't make sense, sir.
Why? Why do I deserve to go?

1371
01:50:11.860 --> 01:50:16.030
Why not any of these guys?
They all fought just as hard as me!

1372
01:50:19.660 --> 01:50:22.740
Is that what they're
supposed to tell your mother

1373
01:50:22.830 --> 01:50:26.160
when they send her another
folded American flag?

1374
01:50:33.380 --> 01:50:35.800
Tell her that when you found me,

1375
01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:39.550
I was here and I was
with the only brothers that I have left,

1376
01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:42.890
and that there's no way
I was gonna desert them.

1377
01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:46.220
I think she'll understand that.

1378
01:50:46.350 --> 01:50:49.310
There's no way I'm leaving this bridge.

1379
01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:34.400
What are your orders?

1380
01:51:36.230 --> 01:51:39.570
Sergeant, we have crossed
some strange boundary here.

1381
01:51:40.570 --> 01:51:43.160
The world has taken a turn
for the surreal.

1382
01:51:43.240 --> 01:51:46.080
Clearly, but the question still stands.

1383
01:51:46.740 --> 01:51:49.750
I don't know. What do you think?

1384
01:51:50.790 --> 01:51:53.580
HORVATH: You don't want to know
what I think.

1385
01:51:55.460 --> 01:51:57.130
No, Mike, I do.

1386
01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:02.130
Well, part of me thinks the kid's right.

1387
01:52:02.260 --> 01:52:04.760
What's he done to deserve this?

1388
01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:08.810
He wants to stay here, fine,
let's leave him and go home.

1389
01:52:10.100 --> 01:52:11.350
Yeah.

1390
01:52:11.930 --> 01:52:17.020
But another part of me thinks
what if, by some miracle, we stay

1391
01:52:17.110 --> 01:52:19.780
and actually make it out of here?

1392
01:52:20.650 --> 01:52:24.280
Someday we might look back on this
and decide that

1393
01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:27.780
saving Private Ryan
was the one decent thing

1394
01:52:27.870 --> 01:52:30.790
we were able to pull out of this whole

1395
01:52:30.870 --> 01:52:33.000
God-awful, shitty mess.

1396
01:52:34.670 --> 01:52:37.170
That's what I was thinking, sir.

1397
01:52:38.340 --> 01:52:40.500
Like you said, Captain,

1398
01:52:42.300 --> 01:52:44.010
we do that,

1399
01:52:44.470 --> 01:52:47.300
we all earn the right to go home.

1400
01:52:50.140 --> 01:52:51.680
Oh, brother.

1401
01:52:55.140 --> 01:52:57.480
TRASK: This is everything.

1402
01:52:58.190 --> 01:53:03.820
You got the two 30-caliber machine
guns, 17 grenades, 11 Hawkins mines.

1403
01:53:04.570 --> 01:53:07.910
You got the two bazookas,
but they only got eight rounds left,

1404
01:53:07.990 --> 01:53:10.200
and assorted small arms.

1405
01:53:10.330 --> 01:53:13.790
We had a 60 mortar
but an arty round took it out.

1406
01:53:13.870 --> 01:53:16.540
Might as well be spit wads
if they roll on us with tanks.

1407
01:53:16.670 --> 01:53:19.880
- Which they're sure to do.
- What are you thinking, sir?

1408
01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:24.590
Well, I'm thinking they're going to try
to whip around the flanks.

1409
01:53:29.180 --> 01:53:31.430
Unless we can draw
them up this main road here

1410
01:53:31.510 --> 01:53:32.640
in between these buildings

1411
01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:36.690
where all the rubble makes
a bit of a bottleneck.

1412
01:53:36.770 --> 01:53:38.810
- Disable 'em?
- If we can.

1413
01:53:38.900 --> 01:53:40.480
Make that tank a 60-ton roadblock.

1414
01:53:40.560 --> 01:53:42.400
We do that, we got
a fighting chance at their flanks.

1415
01:53:42.530 --> 01:53:44.900
Yes, sir that's good. Split them up.
Don't let them mass anywhere.

1416
01:53:45.030 --> 01:53:47.950
Hit them hard as we can, one-on-one,
and fall back to the bridge.

1417
01:53:48.030 --> 01:53:50.240
Machine gun on the move down here,
and number two up high somewhere

1418
01:53:50.370 --> 01:53:52.370
to piss a little bad news down
on their heads.

1419
01:53:52.450 --> 01:53:54.700
MILLER: That would be the idea.

1420
01:53:55.250 --> 01:53:56.710
Jackson.

1421
01:53:57.370 --> 01:53:59.630
If we can, I'd like to get you up
in that bell tower.

1422
01:53:59.710 --> 01:54:02.750
- Yes, sir.
- Give you a little company if you need it.

1423
01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:04.880
Yes, sir. Some company couldn't hurt.

1424
01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:09.010
I'd say a .30 with about
1,000 rounds would be okay.

1425
01:54:09.090 --> 01:54:11.140
Parker, job opportunity.

1426
01:54:11.220 --> 01:54:13.220
Yeah. Well, it's not the worst idea
ever, Captain.

1427
01:54:13.310 --> 01:54:14.890
It's just that everything depends
on getting the tank

1428
01:54:14.970 --> 01:54:17.060
down this main road for us
to knock out, right?

1429
01:54:17.230 --> 01:54:20.230
So how the hell do you
plan on doing that?

1430
01:54:20.730 --> 01:54:21.730
HORVATH: Reiben's right.

1431
01:54:21.810 --> 01:54:23.650
As our esteemed colleague
from the Airborne pointed out,

1432
01:54:23.730 --> 01:54:26.030
what we got here are
a bunch of spit wads,

1433
01:54:26.110 --> 01:54:29.950
so how do we stop the tank
if we get it to commit?

1434
01:54:30.070 --> 01:54:32.450
Give it a rabbit to chase.

1435
01:54:32.580 --> 01:54:35.700
We could hit the tank in the tracks.

1436
01:54:35.790 --> 01:54:37.910
Yeah, but with what?

1437
01:54:39.580 --> 01:54:43.420
- Well, we could try a sticky bomb.
- RYAN: Sticky bomb, sir?

1438
01:54:44.630 --> 01:54:48.470
- Sir, are you making that up?
- No. It's in the field manual.

1439
01:54:48.590 --> 01:54:50.430
You check it out if you want to.

1440
01:54:50.510 --> 01:54:52.600
RYAN: We seem to be out
of field manuals, sir.

1441
01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:54.600
Perhaps you can enlighten us?

1442
01:54:54.680 --> 01:54:56.140
All right, you have
some demolition, don't you?

1443
01:54:56.270 --> 01:54:58.180
Some TNT or some composition B?

1444
01:54:58.270 --> 01:54:59.980
Yeah, that, sir, is the one thing
we got plenty of.

1445
01:55:00.100 --> 01:55:02.740
I got that bridge wired with enough
composition B to blow it twice.

1446
01:55:02.810 --> 01:55:04.820
All right. You can spare some, then.

1447
01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:08.150
You take a standard-issue GI sock,

1448
01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:11.360
cram it with as much
comp B as it can hold,

1449
01:55:11.450 --> 01:55:13.910
rig up a simple fuse,

1450
01:55:13.990 --> 01:55:16.540
then you coat the whole thing
with axle grease.

1451
01:55:16.620 --> 01:55:21.120
That way, when you throw it, it should
stick. It's a bomb that sticks.

1452
01:55:21.210 --> 01:55:22.830
It's a sticky bomb.

1453
01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:25.360
You come up with a better way
to knock the tracks off a tank,

1454
01:55:25.460 --> 01:55:27.050
I'm all ears.

1455
01:55:27.130 --> 01:55:30.670
This is good.
Now we got to surrender our socks.

1456
01:55:45.150 --> 01:55:46.650
Haul away.

1457
01:56:00.660 --> 01:56:04.580
All right, select the field of fire.
Crossfire with the one in the bell tower.

1458
01:56:04.670 --> 01:56:08.000
All right, I can cover
12 to nine from here.

1459
01:56:11.220 --> 01:56:13.340
- Easy!
- I got her!

1460
01:56:47.710 --> 01:56:49.550
Here are the mines.

1461
01:57:00.470 --> 01:57:02.890
For being the best we can do,

1462
01:57:02.980 --> 01:57:06.980
that forward machine gun
is not in a terrible firing position.

1463
01:57:09.650 --> 01:57:12.150
And this position right here,

1464
01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:15.820
this is the Alamo.

1465
01:57:16.410 --> 01:57:20.080
They push us back this far,
last man alive blows the bridge.

1466
01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:22.200
We only got a 30-second delay
on that fuse,

1467
01:57:22.290 --> 01:57:24.330
so let everyone know that
if you are that last man

1468
01:57:24.410 --> 01:57:28.500
you better hurry your ass off,
or you're not going to be alive long.

1469
01:57:28.580 --> 01:57:32.000
Captain? Where am I during all this?

1470
01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:34.880
Never more than
two feet away from me,

1471
01:57:34.970 --> 01:57:37.180
and that's not negotiable.

1472
01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:40.760
I'll get some ammo. Come on.

1473
01:57:43.770 --> 01:57:45.060
- Hey, Upham.
- Yes.

1474
01:57:45.140 --> 01:57:47.020
- Listen to me, all right?
- Yeah.

1475
01:57:47.100 --> 01:57:48.650
- You're listening?
- Yes.

1476
01:57:48.770 --> 01:57:50.810
All right, we're gonna be displacing

1477
01:57:50.940 --> 01:57:52.520
and falling back like crazy
sons of bitches.

1478
01:57:52.610 --> 01:57:53.690
Right up there.

1479
01:57:53.780 --> 01:57:57.240
So you got to be Johnny on the spot
with the ammo, or we're dead.

1480
01:57:57.320 --> 01:57:59.030
- Right.
- You understand that?

1481
01:57:59.110 --> 01:58:01.410
- Johnny on the spot.
- Yeah.

1482
01:58:01.490 --> 01:58:04.620
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yes.

1483
01:58:04.950 --> 01:58:06.210
You know, when we were
shipping out of England

1484
01:58:06.290 --> 01:58:08.250
the supply sergeant was handing
out cartons of cigarettes,

1485
01:58:08.330 --> 01:58:11.460
and I said "No, thank you,
I don't smoke."

1486
01:58:12.460 --> 01:58:14.050
"I don't smoke."

1487
01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:18.840
- Quite a situation, huh?
- Unbelievable.

1488
01:58:20.180 --> 01:58:25.720
Here. Fucked up beyond
all recognition, right?

1489
01:58:26.180 --> 01:58:28.060
You got that right.

1490
01:58:30.310 --> 01:58:31.690
FUBAR.

1491
01:58:34.020 --> 01:58:35.070
Ouch.

1492
01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:36.990
- Yeah, well...
- FUBAR.

1493
01:58:37.070 --> 01:58:39.570
It's going to be a real show, huh?

1494
01:58:39.660 --> 01:58:41.570
Yeah. Okay.

1495
01:58:47.830 --> 01:58:49.500
Take it easy.

1496
01:58:50.670 --> 01:58:52.130
FUBAR.

01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:34.420
- RYAN: Who's that singing, sir?
- Edith Piaf.

1499
01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:39.380
RYAN: What's she so upset about?

1500
01:59:40.220 --> 01:59:41.760
Her lover left her,

1501
01:59:41.880 --> 01:59:45.350
but she still sees his face
everywhere she goes.

1502
01:59:46.510 --> 01:59:48.390
That would do it.

1503
02:00:17.710 --> 02:00:20.670
"Even life itself only represents you."

1504
02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:26.390
"Sometimes I dream
that I'm in your arms."

1505
02:00:26.470 --> 02:00:28.890
What was that part?
She sang that before.

1506
02:00:28.970 --> 02:00:31.350
- The chorus. It's the chorus.
- The chorus.

1507
02:00:32.100 --> 02:00:34.730
"And you speak softly in my ear"

1508
02:00:36.610 --> 02:00:39.020
"and you say things"

1509
02:00:39.110 --> 02:00:41.530
"that make my eyes close."

1510
02:00:43.860 --> 02:00:45.950
"And I find that marvelous."

1511
02:00:46.030 --> 02:00:48.660
- Again, Upham...
- Yes.

1512
02:00:49.370 --> 02:00:53.710
...to be honest with you,
I find myself curiously aroused by you.

1513
02:00:53.790 --> 02:00:54.790
(MEN LAUGHING)

1514
02:00:54.870 --> 02:00:58.380
- Marvelous.
- No, it's really a melancholy song.

1515
02:00:58.460 --> 02:01:02.170
At the beginning of the song, she says,
"And then one day, you left."

1516
02:01:02.300 --> 02:01:06.300
"You left me, and I've been
desperate ever since."

1517
02:01:06.390 --> 02:01:09.560
"I see you all over the sky,
I see you all over the Earth."

1518
02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:11.310
Jesus, Upham,
any more songs like this,

1519
02:01:11.390 --> 02:01:13.110
the krauts aren't going
to have to shoot me.

1520
02:01:13.180 --> 02:01:16.020
I'm just going to slit my own wrists.

1521
02:01:16.150 --> 02:01:18.810
You know,
you're a strange bird, Upham.

1522
02:01:18.900 --> 02:01:20.770
Sorry, it's Edith, you know.

1523
02:01:20.860 --> 02:01:22.860
You know what
that song reminds me of?

1524
02:01:22.990 --> 02:01:25.650
It reminds me of Mrs. Rachel Troubowitz
and what she said to me

1525
02:01:25.740 --> 02:01:27.240
the day I left for basic.

1526
02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:29.870
What, "Don't touch me"?

1527
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:32.540
No. Mrs. Rachel Troubowitz
is our super's wife.

1528
02:01:32.660 --> 02:01:35.460
She comes into my mom's shop
to try on a few things, all right?

1529
02:01:35.540 --> 02:01:39.330
And she's easily, like, a 44 double E.

1530
02:01:39.420 --> 02:01:41.040
- Double E?
- These things are massive.

1531
02:01:41.170 --> 02:01:42.380
Those are big.

1532
02:01:42.500 --> 02:01:45.840
No. And I've got her convinced
that she's, like, a 42 D, all right?

1533
02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:47.630
So we're in the dressing room,
she's trying to squeeze

1534
02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:51.180
into this side-cut,
silk-ribboned, triple-panel girdle

1535
02:01:51.350 --> 02:01:53.520
with the shelf-lift brassiere.

1536
02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:56.190
And it's beautiful 'cause she's just
pouring out of this thing, you know?

1537
02:01:56.270 --> 02:01:58.070
- Is it really tight?
- No, no. It's beautiful.

1538
02:01:58.100 --> 02:01:59.560
And she sees me, and she can tell

1539
02:01:59.690 --> 02:02:02.270
I got a hard-on the size
of the Statue of Liberty, all right?

1540
02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:04.400
And she says to me,
"Richard, calm down."

1541
02:02:04.530 --> 02:02:06.990
And she says, "When you're over there,"

1542
02:02:07.070 --> 02:02:08.950
"if you see anything that upsets you,"

1543
02:02:09.030 --> 02:02:12.120
"or if you're ever scared,
I want you to close your eyes"

1544
02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:15.250
"and think of these. You understand?"

1545
02:02:16.710 --> 02:02:18.870
So I said, "Yes, ma'am."

1546
02:02:32.050 --> 02:02:34.060
RYAN: Are you all right, sir?

1547
02:02:35.100 --> 02:02:37.890
Yeah, I'm just keeping the rhythm.

1548
02:02:42.770 --> 02:02:45.730
Is it true you were
a teacher back home?

1549
02:02:46.780 --> 02:02:48.240
Yes.

1550
02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:50.660
See, that's something I could never do,
you know.

1551
02:02:50.740 --> 02:02:55.240
Not after the way me and my brothers
treated our teachers. No, sir.

1552
02:02:57.580 --> 02:03:00.000
I had 1,000 kids like you.

1553
02:03:06.260 --> 02:03:08.920
I can't see my brothers' faces.

1554
02:03:10.260 --> 02:03:12.970
I've been trying,
and I can't see their faces at all.

1555
02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:15.260
Has that ever happened to you?

1556
02:03:15.350 --> 02:03:17.770
You gotta think of a context.

1557
02:03:19.940 --> 02:03:22.060
What does that mean?

1558
02:03:22.150 --> 02:03:23.690
Well, you don't just think
about their faces.

1559
02:03:23.770 --> 02:03:28.440
You think about something specific,
something you've done together.

1560
02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:35.120
Well, when I think of home,
I think of something specific.

1561
02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:38.290
I think of my hammock in the backyard,

1562
02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:43.460
or my wife pruning the rose bushes
in a pair of my old work gloves.

1563
02:03:47.800 --> 02:03:51.090
This one night, two of my brothers came

1564
02:03:51.170 --> 02:03:54.180
and woke me up in
the middle of the night,

1565
02:03:55.010 --> 02:03:58.060
and they said
they had a surprise for me.

1566
02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:01.770
So they took me to the barn,
up into the loft,

1567
02:04:01.850 --> 02:04:04.810
and there was my oldest brother Dan

1568
02:04:05.980 --> 02:04:09.030
(LAUGHING) with Alice. Alice Jardine.

1569
02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:16.200
I mean, picture a girl who just took
a nosedive from the ugly tree

1570
02:04:16.330 --> 02:04:18.910
and hit every branch coming down.

1571
02:04:20.830 --> 02:04:23.500
And Dan's got her shirt off.

1572
02:04:23.580 --> 02:04:26.380
So he's working on this bra
and he's trying to get it off

1573
02:04:26.500 --> 02:04:29.670
and all of a sudden,
Sean just screams out,

1574
02:04:30.510 --> 02:04:33.880
"Danny, you're a young man!
Don't do it!"

1575
02:04:36.510 --> 02:04:40.020
And so Alice Jardine hears this
and she screams, and she jumps up,

1576
02:04:40.140 --> 02:04:41.770
and she tries to get
running out of the barn,

1577
02:04:41.850 --> 02:04:43.060
but she's still got this shirt
over her head.

1578
02:04:43.190 --> 02:04:47.360
She goes running right into the wall
and knocks herself out.

1579
02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:51.650
So now Dan is just so mad at us,
he starts coming after us,

1580
02:04:51.740 --> 02:04:54.110
but at the same time,
Alice is over there unconscious.

1581
02:04:54.200 --> 02:04:55.700
He's got to wake her up.

1582
02:04:55.820 --> 02:04:59.080
So he grabs her by a leg
and he's dragging her.

1583
02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:02.370
At the same time, he picks up a shovel
and he's going after Sean.

1584
02:05:02.500 --> 02:05:04.620
And Sean said,
"What are you trying to hit me for?"

1585
02:05:04.710 --> 02:05:06.830
"I just did you a favor."

1586
02:05:08.670 --> 02:05:10.550
And so this makes Dan more angry.

1587
02:05:10.670 --> 02:05:13.590
He tries to swing this thing.
He loses the shovel.

1588
02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:16.390
It goes out of his grasp
and hits a kerosene lantern.

1589
02:05:16.510 --> 02:05:19.100
The thing explodes,
the whole barn almost goes up

1590
02:05:19.220 --> 02:05:21.390
because of this thing.

1591
02:05:36.240 --> 02:05:38.120
That was it. That was the last...
That was...

1592
02:05:38.240 --> 02:05:39.780
Dan went off to basic next day.

1593
02:05:39.910 --> 02:05:43.500
That was the last night
the four of us were together.

1594
02:05:43.580 --> 02:05:45.710
That was two years ago.

1595
02:05:47.580 --> 02:05:48.960
Oh, my...

1596
02:05:50.920 --> 02:05:54.460
Tell me about your wife
and those rose bushes.

1597
02:05:55.720 --> 02:05:57.090
No.

1598
02:05:58.260 --> 02:06:00.970
No. That one I save just for me.
