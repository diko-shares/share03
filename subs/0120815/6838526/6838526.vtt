They'd already gotten four
of our Shermans

and a number
of our deuce and a halves.

310

These two minefields
are actually one big one.

311

We tried to make our way up
through the middle of it,

give up those 88s.

It was a tough assignment.
That's why you got it.

finding one particular soldier

344
00:38:52.957 --> 00:38:54.124
in the middle of this
whole goddamn war.

345
00:38:54.208 --> 00:38:56.669
Like finding a needle
in a stack of needles.

346
00:38:56.752 --> 00:38:58.337
But what about the company?

347
00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:01.715
We take the pick of the litter
and the rest get folded into Baker.

348
00:39:01.799 --> 00:39:03.509

349
00:39:03.592 --> 00:39:05.636
They took away your company?

350
00:39:05.719 --> 00:39:10.224
It wasn't my company. It was
the Army's. So they told me, anyway.

351
00:39:10.307 --> 00:39:14.270
Give me Reiben on BAR, Jackson,
Wade, Beasley and Caparzo.

352
00:39:14.353 --> 00:39:15.771
Beasley's dead.

353
00:39:15.855 --> 00:39:18.649
All right, Mellish, then.
We got anybody speaks French?

354
00:39:18.732 --> 00:39:22.570
- Not that I know of.
- What about Talbot?

355
00:39:22.653 --> 00:39:25.656
- This morning.
- Oh. All right.

356
00:39:26.115 --> 00:39:28.200
I'm gonna go try to dig up
another interpreter.

357

on the beach.

- Okay, listen up...

360
00:39:32.746 --> 00:39:34.123
- What?
- What are we gonna do?

361
00:39:34.206 --> 00:39:35.916

in an American flag

362

in your ass, Caparzo, you smart ass.

363
00:39:38.127 --> 00:39:39.879
- Now, listen up.
- I thought you liked it in the ass.

364
00:39:39.962 --> 00:39:41.297
- What?
- I thought you liked it in the ass.

365
00:39:41.964 --> 00:39:44.091
Attention!

366
00:39:44.174 --> 00:39:45.426

367
00:39:45.509 --> 00:39:47.595
I'm looking
for Corporal Upham, Timothy E.

368
00:39:47.678 --> 00:39:49.013
Yes, sir. I'm Upham, sir.

369
00:39:49.096 --> 00:39:50.723
I understand you speak
French and German.

370
00:39:50.806 --> 00:39:52.600
- Yes, sir.
- How's your accent?

371
00:39:52.683 --> 00:39:54.351
Just a slight one in French,
but my German's clean.

372
00:39:54.435 --> 00:39:56.103
- Has a touch of Bavarian, sir.
- Very good.

373
00:39:56.186 --> 00:39:57.771
You've been reassigned to me.
Grab your gear.

374
00:39:57.855 --> 00:40:00.232
- We're going to a place called Neuville.
- Yes, sir.

375
00:40:00.316 --> 00:40:02.484
- When was this updated?
- Updated as of 0830 hour this morning.

376
00:40:02.568 --> 00:40:04.820
- Sir...
- This is the 12th SS Panzer.

377
00:40:04.904 --> 00:40:06.739
These are the two axes
that advance south.

378
00:40:06.822 --> 00:40:09.283
- Sir, there are Germans in Neuville.
- There are artillery up here, sir.

379
00:40:09.366 --> 00:40:12.077
- That's what I understand. Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

380
00:40:12.161 --> 00:40:14.330
Sir, there are a lot
of Germans in Neuville.

381
00:40:14.413 --> 00:40:15.497
You have a problem with that, Corporal?

382
00:40:15.581 --> 00:40:18.042
No, sir. Just if you consider
I've never been in combat, sir.

383
00:40:18.125 --> 00:40:19.752
I make maps and I translate.
And that's...

384
00:40:19.835 --> 00:40:22.755
I need someone who speaks
French and German.

385
00:40:22.838 --> 00:40:24.590
- Yes, sir.
- My two guys were killed.

386
00:40:24.673 --> 00:40:27.343
Yes, sir. It's just that I haven't
held a weapon since basic training, sir.

387
00:40:27.426 --> 00:40:30.054
Did you fire the weapon
in basic training?

388
00:40:30.137 --> 00:40:31.347
Yes, sir.

389
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:34.183
- Well, then, get your gear.
- Yes, sir.

390
00:40:35.309 --> 00:40:37.561
Sir, may I bring...

391
00:40:41.357 --> 00:40:43.859
May I bring my typewriter, sir?

392
00:40:48.906 --> 00:40:50.282
Yes, sir.

393
00:40:53.535 --> 00:40:55.329
Thank you very much, sir.

00:40:55.412 --> 00:40:57.790
- That a souvenir?
- No, sir.

395
00:40:57.873 --> 00:41:00.042
Take your time, Corporal.

396
00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:06.924
You should look
on the bright side of things, Corporal.

397
00:41:07.007 --> 00:41:08.133
Yes, sir.

398
00:41:08.217 --> 00:41:11.261
For one thing,
you don't need to carry those.

399
00:41:11.345 --> 00:41:14.306
- You'll need that.
- I'll need that, sir. Yes, sir.

where you're from, that's...

- Hey, drop dead, Corporal.

Every time you salute the captain,

410
00:42:37.473 --> 00:42:39.683
you make him a target for the Germans.

411
00:42:39.767 --> 00:42:41.560
So do us a favor. Don't do it.

412
00:42:41.643 --> 00:42:44.605

next to him, <i>capisci?</i>

- Hey. Watch your rifle.
- Sorry.

415
00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:50.861
Actually, it's about the...

416
00:42:50.944 --> 00:42:52.404
It's supposed to be about
the bonds of brotherhood

417
00:42:52.488 --> 00:42:54.406
that develop between
soldiers during war.

418
00:42:54.490 --> 00:42:56.575

Why don't you ask
the captain where he's from?

00:43:03.624 --> 00:43:08.003
Yeah, ask the captain. He'll tell you
everything you wanna know about him.

423
00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:10.255
You wanna explain
the math of this to me?

424

supposed to mean, Corporal, huh?

00:43:39.368 --> 00:43:41.036
We're all supposed to die. Is that it?

436
00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.872
Upham's talking about

- Yes, sir.
- We all have orders we have to follow.

including your mothers.

the mission's FUBAR, sir?

Especially if you think
the mission's FUBAR.

- What's FUBAR?
- Oh, it's German. Yeah.

443

Never heard of that.

444
00:44:03.058 --> 00:44:06.353
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.

445
00:44:07.146 --> 00:44:10.065
Well, by all means,
share it with the squad.

446
00:44:10.149 --> 00:44:12.359
Well, from my way of thinking, sir,

447
00:44:12.442 --> 00:44:14.820
this entire mission
is a serious misallocation

448
00:44:14.903 --> 00:44:17.322
of valuable military resources.

449
00:44:17.406 --> 00:44:19.324
Yeah. Go on.

450
00:44:19.408 --> 00:44:21.869
Well, it seems to me, sir,
that God gave me a special gift,

451
00:44:21.952 --> 00:44:25.247
made me a fine instrument of warfare.

452
00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:28.041

Continue, Jackson.

Well, what I mean by that, sir,

455
00:44:31.461 --> 00:44:34.173
is if you was to put me
and this here sniper rifle anywhere,

456
00:44:34.256 --> 00:44:36.967

Oh, that's brilliant, bumpkin.

460
00:44:44.224 --> 00:44:47.269
So, Captain, what about you?
I mean, you don't gripe at all?

461
00:44:47.352 --> 00:44:49.771
I don't gripe to you, Reiben.
I'm a captain.

00:44:54.234 --> 00:44:57.779
I gripe to my superior officers,
so on, so on and so on.

465
00:44:57.863 --> 00:44:59.656
I don't gripe to you.
I don't gripe in front of you.

466
00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:01.742
You should know that as a Ranger.

467
00:45:01.825 --> 00:45:03.702
I'm sorry, sir, but...

468
00:45:03.785 --> 00:45:06.622
Let's say you weren't a captain,
or maybe I was a major.

469

What would you say then?

Well, in that case,

471
00:45:10.459 --> 00:45:12.544

- Not to mention one of our men.

677
01:00:23.955 --> 01:00:27.208
Lieutenant, redeploy that bazooka
to the right side of the road.

678
01:00:27.458 --> 01:00:30.253
- Yes, sir!
- And get Ryan up here.

679
01:00:32.588 --> 01:00:35.508
LIEUTENANT: Ryan! Ryan,
front and center!

680
01:00:36.008 --> 01:00:37.301
Ryan!

681
01:00:40.930 --> 01:00:42.974
Here comes our boy.

682
01:00:50.773 --> 01:00:53.442
Told you he was an asshole.

683
01:00:54.777 --> 01:00:57.113
- Sir, Private Ryan reporting as ordered.
- At ease.

684
01:00:57.613 --> 01:01:01.033
Captain Miller, 2nd Rangers.
He wants a word with you.

685
01:01:02.618 --> 01:01:04.120
This way.

686
01:01:04.996 --> 01:01:07.790
All right. Take a knee.

687
01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:20.678
Private, I'm afraid
I have some bad news for you.

688
01:01:28.352 --> 01:01:32.064
Well, there isn't any real
easy way to say this, so...

689
01:01:34.442 --> 01:01:37.653
So I'll just say it.
Your brothers are dead.

690
01:01:39.113 --> 01:01:42.825
We have orders to come get you

691
01:01:43.826 --> 01:01:45.995
because you're going home.

692
01:01:59.967 --> 01:02:02.595
Oh, my God. My brothers are dead.

693
01:02:10.019 --> 01:02:13.689
(CRYING) I was supposed to
take them fishing when we got home.

694
01:02:16.567 --> 01:02:18.194
(RYAN SNIFFLING)

695
01:02:27.370 --> 01:02:30.581
MILLER: I'm so sorry, James.
I can't tell you how much.

696
01:02:31.874 --> 01:02:36.254
- How... How did they die?
- They were killed in action.

697
01:02:38.756 --> 01:02:41.676
That can't be. They're...

698
01:02:42.385 --> 01:02:46.389
That... That can't be.
My brothers are still in grammar school.

699
01:02:49.767 --> 01:02:52.728
- You're James Ryan?
- Yeah.

700
01:02:53.854 --> 01:02:56.607
James Francis Ryan from Iowa?

701
01:02:57.108 --> 01:02:59.652
James Frederick Ryan, Minnesota.

702
01:03:06.575 --> 01:03:08.828
What? Does that mean
my brothers are okay?

703
01:03:08.911 --> 01:03:10.621
Yeah, I'm sure they're fine.

704
01:03:10.705 --> 01:03:12.498
Are you sure they're okay, though?

705
01:03:12.581 --> 01:03:14.000
We're looking
for a different Private Ryan.

706
01:03:14.083 --> 01:03:16.085
This is just a big foul-up.

707
01:03:16.168 --> 01:03:18.045
How do you know?
How can you be sure?

708
01:03:18.129 --> 01:03:22.258
How do you know the foul-up isn't
that his brothers are okay and that...

709
01:03:22.341 --> 01:03:24.510
Lieutenant, I'm sorry for the trouble.

710
01:03:24.593 --> 01:03:28.764
I just wrote them a letter right
before I left. I got to get home.

711
01:03:30.057 --> 01:03:32.018
I got to get home right now.

712
01:03:32.101 --> 01:03:34.603
- I wanna go home.
- SOLDIER: Easy, now.

713
01:03:35.521 --> 01:03:37.023
- So, where in the hell is our Ryan?
- I don't know.

714
01:03:37.106 --> 01:03:39.191
Are you in touch with your CO?

715
01:03:39.275 --> 01:03:41.193
- That figures.
- What unit's your Ryan in?

716
01:03:41.277 --> 01:03:43.487
Baker Company, 506th.

717
01:03:43.571 --> 01:03:45.114
The guy with the broken foot,
he's 506, right?

718
01:03:45.197 --> 01:03:46.866
Yeah. Charlie, I think.

719
01:03:46.949 --> 01:03:48.617
- You think?
- Yeah.

720
01:03:48.701 --> 01:03:51.954
Ryan? Don't know... Man!

721
01:03:52.038 --> 01:03:54.623
- MILLER: Where was your drop zone?
- Just inside of Vierville.

722
01:03:54.707 --> 01:03:57.585
MILLER: Vierville? How the hell did you
end up way up here?

723
01:03:57.668 --> 01:04:00.880
You got me, sir. C-47 took heavy fire.

724
01:04:00.963 --> 01:04:03.758
Pilot went crazy trying to get out
of there, turning every which way.

725
01:04:03.841 --> 01:04:07.803
Took more fire on the drop.
Got messy. I ended up here.

726
01:04:07.887 --> 01:04:09.930
I haven't seen a single guy
from my stick, sir.

727
01:04:10.014 --> 01:04:11.432
God knows where they are.

728
01:04:11.515 --> 01:04:13.225
Anybody from Baker Company
have, like, a big mouth?

729
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:15.102
Talk about where the drop zone
might've been?

730
01:04:15.186 --> 01:04:18.689
No, sir, but I know Baker Company
had the same rally point as us.

731
01:04:18.773 --> 01:04:20.024
Show me.

732
01:04:21.359 --> 01:04:22.401
My men are beat.

733
01:04:22.485 --> 01:04:24.487
We're gonna hold up here
for about three hours.

734
01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:27.114
We'll pull out after dark.

735
01:04:27.198 --> 01:04:30.076
Got anything left in this town
like a three-star hotel?

736
01:04:30.159 --> 01:04:33.412
Something with clean sheets
and soft pillows and room service?

737
01:04:33.496 --> 01:04:36.916
- How about a nice, comfy church?
- We'll take that.

738
01:04:36.999 --> 01:04:39.877
What have you heard?
How's it all falling together?

739
01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.587
Well, we got the beachhead secure.

740
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:44.256
Problem is Monty's taking
his time moving on Caen.

741
01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:46.634
We can't pull out till he's ready, so...

742
01:04:46.717 --> 01:04:49.345
- That guy's overrated.
- No argument here.

743
01:04:49.428 --> 01:04:52.223
You gotta take Caen,
so you can take Saint-Lô.

744
01:04:52.306 --> 01:04:54.225
You got to take Saint-Lô
to take Valognes.

745
01:04:54.308 --> 01:04:55.976
Valognes, you got Cherbourg.

746
01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:59.397
- Cherbourg, you got Paris.
- Paris, you get Berlin.

747
01:04:59.855 --> 01:05:02.191
And then that big boat home.

748
01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:07.113
We sure as hell
could use you around here,

749
01:05:07.196 --> 01:05:09.407
but I understand what you're doing.

750
01:05:09.490 --> 01:05:11.117
- You do?
- Yeah.

751
01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:13.828
I got a couple of brothers myself.

752
01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:16.872
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

753
01:05:17.248 --> 01:05:21.210
No, I mean it. Find him. Get him home.

754
01:05:29.677 --> 01:05:31.679
HORVATH: What's with your hand?

755
01:05:33.139 --> 01:05:34.974
I don't know.

756
01:05:36.684 --> 01:05:37.977
It started in Portsmouth

757
01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:39.728
when they brought us
down for embarkation.

758
01:05:39.895 --> 01:05:41.355
It comes and goes.

759
01:05:41.439 --> 01:05:44.316
Well, you may have to get
yourself a new line of work.

760
01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:47.820
This one doesn't seem
to agree with you anymore.

761
01:05:50.281 --> 01:05:51.824
(LAUGHING)

762
01:05:53.075 --> 01:05:54.410
What?

763
01:05:59.081 --> 01:06:00.666
- What?
- Nothing.

764
01:06:01.417 --> 01:06:04.211
What was the name
of that kid at Anzio?

765
01:06:04.295 --> 01:06:06.755
The one that was always walking
around on his hands, you know?

766
01:06:06.922 --> 01:06:10.509
And he was singing that song
about the man on the flying trapeze.

767
01:06:10.593 --> 01:06:12.303
- Vecchio.
- Vecchio.

768
01:06:12.386 --> 01:06:14.054
(BOTH LAUGHING)

769
01:06:18.893 --> 01:06:20.227
Yeah, Vecchio.

770
01:06:20.311 --> 01:06:22.188
He was a goofy kid.

771
01:06:23.939 --> 01:06:26.942
Remember, he used to pee
a "V" on everybody's jacket

772
01:06:27.026 --> 01:06:30.279
for Vecchio, for victory.

773
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:38.704
MILLER: He was so short.
He was a midget, wasn't he?

774
01:06:38.787 --> 01:06:41.540
"How did you get to be a Ranger?"

775
01:06:42.791 --> 01:06:44.043
HORVATH: He got shot in the foot once,
didn't he,

776
01:06:44.126 --> 01:06:45.127
when he was walking on his hands?

777
01:06:45.211 --> 01:06:48.172
MILLER: Yeah. He could walk
faster on his hands.

778
01:06:49.298 --> 01:06:52.343
He could run faster on his hands than...

779
01:06:55.262 --> 01:06:56.639
Vecchio.

780
01:06:57.765 --> 01:06:59.016
Yeah.

781
01:07:00.643 --> 01:07:02.019
Caparzo.

782
01:07:08.526 --> 01:07:13.447
You see, when you end up
killing one of your men,

783
01:07:14.323 --> 01:07:17.451
you tell yourself it happened

784
01:07:17.535 --> 01:07:23.165
so you could save the lives
of two or three or 10 others.

785
01:07:24.833 --> 01:07:26.835
Maybe 100 others.

786
01:07:31.090 --> 01:07:34.051
Do you know how many men
I've lost under my command?

787
01:07:34.134 --> 01:07:36.345
- How many?
- Ninety-four.

788
01:07:37.763 --> 01:07:43.519
But that means I've saved the lives
of 10 times that many, doesn't it?

789
01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:47.940
Maybe even 20, right?
Twenty times as many?

790
01:07:54.029 --> 01:07:56.365
And that's how simple it is.

791
01:07:57.324 --> 01:07:59.034
That's how you...

792
01:08:00.369 --> 01:08:03.038
That's how you rationalize
making the choice

793
01:08:03.122 --> 01:08:05.624
between the mission and the men.

794
01:08:06.041 --> 01:08:09.169
Except this time, the mission is a man.

795
01:08:12.464 --> 01:08:14.925
This Ryan better be worth it.

796
01:08:17.928 --> 01:08:20.723
He'd better go home,
cure some disease,

797
01:08:20.806 --> 01:08:24.310
or invent a longer-lasting
light bulb or something.

798
01:08:25.102 --> 01:08:26.812
'Cause the truth is
I wouldn't trade 10 Ryans

799
01:08:26.895 --> 01:08:29.690
for one Vecchio or one Caparzo.

800
01:08:29.773 --> 01:08:31.066
Amen.

801
01:08:33.485 --> 01:08:35.613
Look. There it goes again.

802
01:08:36.655 --> 01:08:39.575
Sir, are you all right?

803
01:08:44.872 --> 01:08:48.167
Now, look, we're gonna
move out in two hours.

804
01:08:48.250 --> 01:08:50.502
Why don't you get some sleep?

805
01:08:50.586 --> 01:08:53.672
REIBEN: I don't know how he does it.
MELLISH: What's that?

806
01:08:53.756 --> 01:08:56.425
Falls asleep like that.
I mean, look at him.

807
01:08:56.508 --> 01:08:59.553
The guy's lights out the minute
his head hits the pack.

808
01:08:59.637 --> 01:09:01.221
Clear conscience.

809
01:09:01.305 --> 01:09:02.890
Yeah. What's that saying?

810
01:09:02.973 --> 01:09:06.143
"If God's on our side,
who the hell could be on theirs?"

811
01:09:06.226 --> 01:09:08.812
"If God be for us,
who could be against us?"

812
01:09:08.896 --> 01:09:11.023
REIBEN: Yeah, what did I say?

813
01:09:11.106 --> 01:09:15.361
WADE: Well, actually, the trick to
falling asleep is trying to stay awake.

814
01:09:15.444 --> 01:09:17.196
How is that, Wade?

815
01:09:17.279 --> 01:09:22.284
Well, when my mother was an intern,
she used to work late through the night,

816
01:09:22.368 --> 01:09:24.870
sleep through the day.

817
01:09:24.953 --> 01:09:26.830
So the only time that we ever got
to talk about anything

818
01:09:26.914 --> 01:09:28.374
was when she'd get home.

819
01:09:28.457 --> 01:09:31.001
So what I used to do,
I used to lie in my bed

820
01:09:31.085 --> 01:09:32.586
and try to stay awake
as long as I could,

821
01:09:32.670 --> 01:09:36.382
but it never worked
'cause the harder I tried,

822
01:09:36.465 --> 01:09:38.717
the faster I'd fall asleep.

823
01:09:40.094 --> 01:09:42.054
REIBEN: Yeah. Well, that wouldn't have
mattered none in my house.

824
01:09:42.137 --> 01:09:44.306
My ma, she would've come home,
shook me awake,

825
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:46.225
chatted me up till dawn.

826
01:09:46.642 --> 01:09:48.852
I swear, that woman
was never too tired to talk.

827
01:09:48.936 --> 01:09:52.940
Yeah. That's probably the only time
she could get a word in.

828
01:09:56.985 --> 01:10:00.531
Funny thing is,
sometimes she'd come home early,

829
01:10:00.614 --> 01:10:03.242
and I'd pretend to be asleep.

830
01:10:03.325 --> 01:10:06.995
- MELLISH: Who? Your mum?
- Yeah.

831
01:10:09.665 --> 01:10:12.668
She'd stand in the doorway,
looking at me.

832
01:10:13.168 --> 01:10:15.587
And I'd just keep my eyes shut.

833
01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:21.969
And I knew she just wanted
to find out about my day,

834
01:10:22.553 --> 01:10:25.013
that she came home early

835
01:10:26.432 --> 01:10:28.392
just to talk to me.

836
01:10:31.603 --> 01:10:35.816
And I still wouldn't move.
I'd still pretend to just be asleep.

837
01:10:43.031 --> 01:10:45.325
I don't know why I did that.

838
01:10:58.881 --> 01:11:02.468
MILLER: We only got a couple of hours.
Shut up and go to sleep.

839
01:11:11.226 --> 01:11:14.104
Captain? Sir?

840
01:11:16.148 --> 01:11:17.566
Corporal?

841
01:11:22.821 --> 01:11:25.908
How you doing there? Are you all right?

842
01:11:26.074 --> 01:11:29.077
Yeah, I think this is
all good for me, sir.

843
01:11:30.496 --> 01:11:31.955
Really?

844
01:11:32.706 --> 01:11:34.208
How is that?

845
01:11:38.128 --> 01:11:40.672
"War educates the senses,

846
01:11:40.756 --> 01:11:42.716
"calls into action the will,

847
01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:45.511
"perfects the physical constitution,

848
01:11:45.886 --> 01:11:48.764
"brings men into such swift
and close collision

849
01:11:48.847 --> 01:11:51.975
"in critical moments
that man measures man."

850
01:11:52.434 --> 01:11:55.145
Yeah. Well, I guess
that's Emerson's way

851
01:11:55.604 --> 01:11:57.356
of finding the bright side.

852
01:11:57.439 --> 01:12:01.109
- You know Emerson, sir?
- I know some.

853
01:12:05.614 --> 01:12:09.618
So, where are you from, Captain?
What'd you do before the war?

854
01:12:11.662 --> 01:12:13.997
What's the pool up to?

855
01:12:17.334 --> 01:12:20.170
You know, I think it's around 300, sir.

856
01:12:21.004 --> 01:12:23.674
Well, when it gets up to 500,

857
01:12:23.757 --> 01:12:26.009
I'll give you the answers,
and we'll split the money.

858
01:12:26.093 --> 01:12:28.095
How about that?

859
01:12:28.178 --> 01:12:31.765
Well, if that's the way you feel, sir.
I feel it's my duty under your command

860
01:12:31.849 --> 01:12:36.103
to suggest that we wait
until it gets up to 1,000, sir.

861
01:12:37.813 --> 01:12:40.315
What if we don't live that long?

862
01:12:43.485 --> 01:12:46.572
- 500?
- 500 would be good, yeah.

863
01:12:46.655 --> 01:12:48.615
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

864
01:12:51.243 --> 01:12:53.996
- Get some sleep, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

865
01:13:04.339 --> 01:13:06.341
(DISTANT EXPLOSIONS)

866
01:14:00.562 --> 01:14:02.814
SOLDIER 1: Who's got sulfa powder?

867
01:14:05.192 --> 01:14:09.321
Medic! My buddy's bleeding!
He needs a tourniquet!

868
01:14:09.404 --> 01:14:10.948
- Wade.
- Yes, sir?

869
01:14:11.031 --> 01:14:12.991
- See what you can do.
- Yes, sir.

870
01:14:13.075 --> 01:14:16.411
Hold on, fellas.
It won't be much longer.

871
01:14:16.578 --> 01:14:18.413
How we doing here?

872
01:14:19.081 --> 01:14:20.374
All right.

873
01:14:20.457 --> 01:14:23.001
Yeah, doing all right.
Don't worry about it.

874
01:14:23.085 --> 01:14:24.836
Doc's in town.

875
01:14:25.253 --> 01:14:26.380
It's all right. It's all right.

876
01:14:26.463 --> 01:14:27.965
Don't worry, fellas.

877
01:14:28.048 --> 01:14:30.592
The 29th Infantry's breaking through,
they'll be here soon.

878
01:14:30.676 --> 01:14:33.011
SOLDIER 1: Plasma.
Anybody got plasma?

879
01:14:33.095 --> 01:14:36.974
- Captain. Hey, Captain.
- Soldier, you want to fill me in?

880
01:14:37.057 --> 01:14:39.017
Yeah. Lieutenant DeWindt, sir.

881
01:14:39.101 --> 01:14:42.729
99th Troop Carrier Squadron,
carrying in 327th Glider Infantry.

882
01:14:42.813 --> 01:14:44.356
This one was mine, sir.

883
01:14:44.439 --> 01:14:45.857
- I was the pilot.
- Private?

884
01:14:45.941 --> 01:14:47.484
- Twenty-two men dead.
- Private, take care of...

885
01:14:47.567 --> 01:14:50.404
I ended up over there without a scratch.
It took my co-pilot's head right off.

886
01:14:50.487 --> 01:14:52.114
Well, where's the unit?
Who are these people?

887
01:14:52.197 --> 01:14:55.200
Well, the guys we came in with, sir,
they headed off first night.

888
01:14:55.283 --> 01:14:56.576
Haven't seen them since.

889
01:14:56.660 --> 01:15:00.706
Meantime, other guys keep showing up,
one, two, half-dozen at a time.

890
01:15:00.789 --> 01:15:03.583
Then some officer'll come along
and patch together a mixed unit,

891
01:15:03.667 --> 01:15:04.793
head off to make trouble, sir.

892
01:15:04.876 --> 01:15:06.128
SOLDIER 2: Water.
I need a canteen over here.

893
01:15:06.211 --> 01:15:08.213
We're looking for a Private James Ryan.

894
01:15:08.296 --> 01:15:10.549
He's in Baker Company,
the 506 of the 101st.

895
01:15:10.632 --> 01:15:12.968
No, you got me, sir.
A lot of guys come in and out of here.

896
01:15:13.051 --> 01:15:14.511
- Upham.
- Yes, sir.

897
01:15:14.594 --> 01:15:16.430
Check out that squad.
See if Ryan's in it.

898
01:15:16.513 --> 01:15:18.181
Yes, sir.

899
01:15:19.558 --> 01:15:20.976
Reiben.

900
01:15:21.476 --> 01:15:25.564
Smell that leg right there.
Find out if it's south of cheese.

901
01:15:31.194 --> 01:15:32.529
WADE: What?

902
01:15:34.281 --> 01:15:35.490
<i>Juden.</i>

903
01:15:37.409 --> 01:15:39.369
<i>- Juden.</i>
- SOLDIER: Keep moving.

904
01:15:39.453 --> 01:15:41.329
- Keep moving!
<i>- Juden.</i>

905
01:15:42.247 --> 01:15:44.624
I'm <i>Juden,</i> you know?

906
01:15:46.835 --> 01:15:49.421
Yeah, I couldn't pry him out of there,
hard as I tried.

907
01:15:49.504 --> 01:15:51.757
- I'd need a winch.
- Yeah.

908
01:15:55.886 --> 01:15:57.179
HORVATH: Stars.

909
01:15:57.554 --> 01:16:02.100
Yep, Brigadier General Amend,
Deputy Commander, 101st.

910
01:16:02.934 --> 01:16:05.479
Some fucking genius had the great idea

911
01:16:05.562 --> 01:16:07.105
of welding a couple of steel plates

912
01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:10.442
onto our deck to keep
the general safe from ground fire.

913
01:16:10.525 --> 01:16:12.152
Unfortunately,
they forgot to tell me about it

914
01:16:12.235 --> 01:16:14.613
until we were just getting airborne.

915
01:16:14.696 --> 01:16:17.699
Well, that's like trying
to fly a freight train. Okay.

916
01:16:18.366 --> 01:16:21.745
Gross overload.
Trim characteristics all shot to hell.

917
01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:25.123
I nearly broke both my arms
trying to keep her level.

918
01:16:25.207 --> 01:16:27.334
(STAMMERING) And when we released,

919
01:16:27.417 --> 01:16:29.711
you know, I cut as hard as I could,

920
01:16:29.795 --> 01:16:33.298
tried to gain some altitude
and still keep her from stalling.

921
01:16:33.381 --> 01:16:37.552
We came down like a fucking meteor.
And this is how we ended up.

922
01:16:39.721 --> 01:16:42.974
And the others, they stopped easy
enough okay though, you know?

923
01:16:43.058 --> 01:16:46.853
We were just... We were just
too damn heavy, you know?

924
01:16:46.937 --> 01:16:48.730
The grass was wet.

925
01:16:49.564 --> 01:16:51.733
Downward slope and all.

926
01:16:52.442 --> 01:16:54.361
Twenty-two guys dead.

927
01:16:57.155 --> 01:17:00.659
- All that for a general?
- One man.

928
01:17:02.911 --> 01:17:06.206
- A lot of that going around.
- FUBAR.

929
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:08.750
- FUBAR.
- FUBAR.

930
01:17:09.543 --> 01:17:10.961
FUBAR.

931
01:17:11.044 --> 01:17:13.171
You all got that right.

932
01:17:13.672 --> 01:17:15.590
Hey, I looked up "FUBAR"
in the German dictionary.

933
01:17:15.674 --> 01:17:16.675
There's no "FUBAR" in there.

934
01:17:16.758 --> 01:17:18.009
- MILLER: Upham.
- Yes, sir?

935
01:17:18.093 --> 01:17:20.679
There's more paratroops out there.
Find out if one of them is Ryan.

936
01:17:20.762 --> 01:17:22.180
UPHAM: Yes, sir.

937
01:17:22.264 --> 01:17:24.975
Oh, you might want
to check these out, sir.

938
01:17:25.058 --> 01:17:26.601
Dog tags.

939
01:17:26.685 --> 01:17:29.604
More than I really want to count, sir.

940
01:17:30.814 --> 01:17:33.650
I've covered a lot of bodies, sir.

941
01:17:33.775 --> 01:17:35.193
MILLER: Jackson.

942
01:17:35.819 --> 01:17:38.655
- Start going through those.
- Yes, sir.

943
01:17:39.906 --> 01:17:41.449
I'll help.

944
01:17:43.702 --> 01:17:46.246
What do you think, Jackson? Do you think
that little prick's in there?

945
01:17:46.329 --> 01:17:49.332
Well, if he is, I'm gonna find him.
I bet that son of a bitch is here.

946
01:17:49.416 --> 01:17:51.334
I got big money saying
this guy's still alive.

947
01:17:51.418 --> 01:17:53.545
MELLISH: 10 bucks says I nail him first.

948
01:17:53.628 --> 01:17:56.214
- Let's see who we got in here.
- You mugs don't stand a chance.

949
01:17:56.298 --> 01:17:58.216
All right, you think this little
shit bird is in here or what?

950
01:17:58.300 --> 01:17:59.968
Just keep looking.

951
01:18:00.468 --> 01:18:02.637
All right. Gary Ianico.

952
01:18:02.721 --> 01:18:04.514
Ben Rubino. Mike Cessacchio.

953
01:18:04.598 --> 01:18:06.391
I swear.
All the guineas are buying it, huh?

954
01:18:06.474 --> 01:18:08.226
MELLISH: Oh, come on,
not the right name.

955
01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:11.354
Wee Willie Winkie,
that's a buddy of yours.

956
01:18:11.605 --> 01:18:13.982
REIBEN: We gotta find this prick.

957
01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.155
Where is this son of a bitch?

958
01:18:20.238 --> 01:18:22.782
Don't mix them up, Jackson, all right?
Keep them in your own fucking pile.

959
01:18:22.866 --> 01:18:25.202
How am I supposed to know
who we got?

960
01:18:25.285 --> 01:18:27.954
Why don't you just shut up,
Reiben? All right.

961
01:18:28.038 --> 01:18:31.541
REIBEN: Everybody be friends.
MELLISH: Cranky there, huh?

962
01:18:32.667 --> 01:18:35.462
- I think I got a winner.
- What you talking about?

963
01:18:35.545 --> 01:18:37.005
Ryan.

964
01:18:37.214 --> 01:18:39.799
- Ryan.
- Take a look at that, Mellish.

965
01:18:40.342 --> 01:18:41.635
You know what?
You're a genius. You really are.

966
01:18:41.718 --> 01:18:43.553
R-I-E-N-N-E.

967
01:18:43.637 --> 01:18:45.597
That's Rienne and that's French.
All right.

968
01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.766
- You know what that means?
- JACKSON: It means nothing.

969
01:18:47.849 --> 01:18:49.768
MELLISH: What beats three of a kind?
JACKSON: I got shit here.

970
01:18:49.851 --> 01:18:53.605
- I got all guys from New York.
- MELLISH: I got a full house.

971
01:18:53.688 --> 01:18:55.774
REIBEN: Do you need a hand with that?
MELLISH: I got a full house.

972
01:18:55.857 --> 01:18:57.108
I got you beat.

973
01:18:57.192 --> 01:18:58.443
- I got the straight flush.
- Full house, he's got.

974
01:18:58.526 --> 01:19:01.947
You were looking at my tags.
You're cheating, you know?

975
01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:04.115
- Ryan.
- Fucking unreal, this guy.

976
01:19:04.199 --> 01:19:06.785
REIBEN: Do you need a hand with that?
Can you read that shit?

977
01:19:06.868 --> 01:19:09.454
Jesus Christ. Look at this poor bastard.

978
01:19:09.537 --> 01:19:11.289
MELLISH: I guess they're
not bullet-proof, huh?

979
01:19:11.373 --> 01:19:12.666
REIBEN: Guess not. All right?

980
01:19:12.749 --> 01:19:14.167
I don't like
what he's got between his ears.

981
01:19:14.251 --> 01:19:17.128
JACKSON: Sort of like what you fellas
got between your legs.

982
01:19:17.212 --> 01:19:19.297
MELLISH: We got to give him that.
REIBEN: That's not bad.

983
01:19:19.381 --> 01:19:20.882
Not bad with you, Jackson.

984
01:19:21.007 --> 01:19:22.968
All right, I got three of a kind.
All right.

985
01:19:23.051 --> 01:19:24.219
- Full house.
- What the hell are you doing?

986
01:19:24.344 --> 01:19:26.805
The whole goddamn
Airborne's watching.

987
01:19:26.888 --> 01:19:28.390
These aren't poker chips.

988
01:19:28.473 --> 01:19:29.724
JACKSON: All right, all right,
all right.

989
01:19:29.808 --> 01:19:32.310
Put them back in there!

990
01:19:55.834 --> 01:19:57.502
He's not here.

991
01:20:01.923 --> 01:20:04.342
Maybe we should bust up
into a couple of different groups, huh?

992
01:20:04.426 --> 01:20:05.677
And wander the woods
like Hansel and Gretel,

993
01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:06.845
calling his name.

994
01:20:06.928 --> 01:20:10.098
He's bound to hear us sooner
or later. Ryan!

995
01:20:10.181 --> 01:20:13.351
That might be
a little hard to do, Captain.

996
01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:16.229
Maybe the locals have seen him.
Hey, you know...

997
01:20:16.313 --> 01:20:17.522
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

998
01:20:17.605 --> 01:20:20.442
Ryan? James Ryan?
<i>Merci. Merci beaucoup.</i>

999
01:20:20.608 --> 01:20:23.153
Ryan! Anybody know Ryan,
101st Airborne?

1000
01:20:23.236 --> 01:20:27.032
Ryan? You know a guy named Ryan?
Private James Ryan from Iowa?

1001
01:20:27.115 --> 01:20:29.159
Anybody know a Ryan?

1002
01:20:29.617 --> 01:20:31.578
James Ryan!

1003
01:20:31.661 --> 01:20:37.625
Hey, Joe, doesn't Mandelsohn pal
around with a Ryan from C Company?

1004
01:20:37.709 --> 01:20:41.004
- Yeah. I think so.
- Bring him up here, would you?

1005
01:20:50.305 --> 01:20:52.891
- Do you know Private Ryan?
- You're gonna have to speak up, sir.

1006
01:20:52.974 --> 01:20:54.184
(YELLING) You're gonna have to
speak up, sir.

1007
01:20:54.267 --> 01:20:55.935
- My hearing is not good!

- It comes and goes!
- A German grenade went off

1009
01:20:57.312 --> 01:20:59.147
- next to his ear.
- A grenade went off right by my head!

1010
01:20:59.230 --> 01:21:02.275
Got it, got it.
Do you know Private Ryan?

1011
01:21:02.359 --> 01:21:03.818
Who?

1012
01:21:03.902 --> 01:21:06.363
Private Ryan! James Ryan!

1013
01:21:06.446 --> 01:21:10.658
- Jimmy Ryan?
- James! James Francis Ryan!

1014
01:21:10.742 --> 01:21:14.579
- No, no, no. James Francis Ryan.
- All right. Get me a pencil.

1015
01:21:14.662 --> 01:21:16.998
Something to write on.
Something to write on.

1016
01:21:17.082 --> 01:21:19.584
Quick! Quick! Come on, a pencil!

1017
01:21:21.336 --> 01:21:23.129
A small one, sir.

1018
01:21:23.755 --> 01:21:24.881
Write this down.

1019
01:21:24.964 --> 01:21:26.925
James Francis Ryan, question mark.

1020
01:21:27.008 --> 01:21:28.802
Iowa, question mark.

1021
01:21:28.885 --> 01:21:31.388
Do you know him? Does he know him?

1022
01:21:31.471 --> 01:21:33.515
Read the message. Look.

1023
01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:39.354
- Yeah. Of course I know him, sir.
- Does he know where he is?

1024
01:21:43.233 --> 01:21:46.611
Yeah, yeah. We missed
our drop zone by about 20 miles,

1025
01:21:46.694 --> 01:21:50.031
ended up way over
by Bumville or some damn place.

1026
01:21:50.115 --> 01:21:53.243
Him, me and a couple of other guys
were coming here to the rally point,

1027
01:21:53.326 --> 01:21:58.498
ran into a Colonel who was gathering
up men to go to Ramelle.

1028
01:21:58.832 --> 01:21:59.916
Ramelle.

1029
01:21:59.999 --> 01:22:02.460
To baby-sit a bridge.
That's the last I've seen of him, sir.

1030
01:22:02.544 --> 01:22:04.462
Great! Great! Thank you.

1031
01:22:04.546 --> 01:22:06.840
Write thank... Read, and thank you.

1032
01:22:06.923 --> 01:22:09.384
- MANDELSOHN: You're welcome!
- Assemble on me.

1033
01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:13.596
Thank you, Lieutenant.

1034
01:22:16.182 --> 01:22:17.600
Ramelle.

1035
01:22:19.144 --> 01:22:21.312
We're here. There.

1036
01:22:21.729 --> 01:22:27.026
Ramelle is on the Merderet River,
right here, just to the southwest of us.

1037
01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:29.487
You know anything about this bridge
he was talking about, Captain?

1038
01:22:29.571 --> 01:22:33.450
Yep. The target has
always been Cherbourg.

1039
01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:37.704
We can't push on Paris
until we take a deep water port.

1040
01:22:37.787 --> 01:22:39.581
And Rommel knows that,

1041
01:22:39.664 --> 01:22:41.249
so he's gonna try to get his armor

1042
01:22:41.332 --> 01:22:44.711
across the Merderet river
anywhere he can.

1043
01:22:44.794 --> 01:22:46.796
That way, he can hit
our invasion forces in the flank

1044
01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:49.549
when we make
the big right turn to Cherbourg.

1045
01:22:49.632 --> 01:22:51.342
That makes any village on that river

1046
01:22:51.426 --> 01:22:54.721
with an intact bridge
solid gold real estate.

1047
01:23:15.408 --> 01:23:16.826
Let's go.

1048
01:23:26.294 --> 01:23:27.670
MELLISH: Captain.

1049
01:24:06.042 --> 01:24:08.002
HORVATH: What the hell is that?

1050
01:24:09.212 --> 01:24:12.340
MILLER: A radar site.
It's gotta be out of action.

1051
01:24:12.423 --> 01:24:17.220
Looks like we got something in that.
Sandbag bunker right under the station.

1052
01:24:18.388 --> 01:24:21.266
- See it?
- Yeah. That's my guess, too.

1053
01:24:22.684 --> 01:24:24.435
What is it?

1054
01:24:25.103 --> 01:24:27.397
Machine gun. Probably MG42.

1055
01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:29.774
Jesus. Is that what got those guys?

1056
01:24:29.857 --> 01:24:31.776
Maybe one of them's our boy.

1057
01:24:31.901 --> 01:24:35.280
MILLER: No, their patches are 82nd,
so your luck's not that good.

1058
01:24:35.363 --> 01:24:37.448
Yeah, well, I don't know how fast
the rest of you betties are,

1059
01:24:37.532 --> 01:24:40.034
but I'm thinking we detour
this way quick and quiet,

1060
01:24:40.118 --> 01:24:43.162
the krauts will never
even know we were here.

1061
01:24:43.246 --> 01:24:46.833
So, Captain, what I'm trying to say is
why don't we just go around the thing?

1062
01:24:46.916 --> 01:24:50.336
I hear what you're saying,
but we can't go around it.

1063
01:24:51.963 --> 01:24:53.840
I'm with Reiben on this one, sir.

1064
01:24:53.923 --> 01:24:58.052
- I mean, we left them 88s.
- For the Air Force.

1065
01:24:58.136 --> 01:25:02.223
The Air Force isn't gonna spend
ordnance on one machine gun.

1066
01:25:02.682 --> 01:25:04.142
Captain...

1067
01:25:05.184 --> 01:25:07.020
We can still skip it
and accomplish our mission.

1068
01:25:07.103 --> 01:25:10.106
I mean, this isn't
our mission, right, sir?

1069
01:25:10.189 --> 01:25:12.400
Oh. That's what
you want to do, Mellish?

1070
01:25:12.483 --> 01:25:13.943
You just want to leave it here,
so they can ambush

1071
01:25:14.027 --> 01:25:15.320
the next company that comes along?

1072
01:25:15.403 --> 01:25:16.779
No, sir. That's not what I'm saying.

1073
01:25:16.863 --> 01:25:19.657
I'm simply saying
it seems like an unnecessary risk,

1074
01:25:19.741 --> 01:25:21.200
given our objective, sir.

1075
01:25:21.284 --> 01:25:24.037
Our objective is to win the war.

1076
01:25:27.248 --> 01:25:31.252
Sir, I just... I don't have
a good feeling about this one.

1077
01:25:33.755 --> 01:25:37.467
When was the last time
you felt good about anything?

1078
01:25:58.363 --> 01:26:01.532
All right, three runners
with suppressing fire.

1079
01:26:01.616 --> 01:26:04.827
Mellish, you hook to the right.
I'll go up the middle.

1080
01:26:04.952 --> 01:26:06.663
Who's going left?

1081
01:26:13.086 --> 01:26:14.921
Who's going left?

1082
01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:20.760
I'll do it.

1083
01:26:21.719 --> 01:26:24.305
- I'll go left.
- All right.

1084
01:26:24.389 --> 01:26:27.183
Upham, switch off with Jackson,
and you linger in the rear.

1085
01:26:27.266 --> 01:26:28.726
Yes, sir.

1086
01:26:29.435 --> 01:26:34.273
We advance and keep pressure on him
till he has to change out his barrels.

1087
01:26:35.108 --> 01:26:37.068
I think we should be able
to hit him from grenade range.

1088
01:26:37.151 --> 01:26:41.406
- Maybe I should go up the middle, sir.
- The way you run? I don't think so.

1089
01:26:41.489 --> 01:26:45.284
- Maybe I should go left, sir.
- Maybe you should shut up.

1090
01:26:46.077 --> 01:26:48.454
Reiben, base of fire.

1091
01:26:56.838 --> 01:26:59.757
Mags and clips where
you can reach them, and...

1092
01:26:59.841 --> 01:27:02.802
And extra grenades
for the base runners.

Shut up with that filthy pig latin.

01:33:06.957 --> 01:33:08.876
Jackson, you're hit.

1172
01:33:11.045 --> 01:33:12.296
Shit.

1173
01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:16.217
- I guess it just skinned the arm, sir.
- Get it cleaned and dressed.

1174
01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:18.719

- I don't care what he says, Upham.

1177
01:33:27.186 --> 01:33:30.231
Sir? Sir, you're gonna
let them kill him?

1178
01:33:31.232 --> 01:33:35.486
- This is not right, sir.
- You can help him with the bodies.

1179
01:33:37.822 --> 01:33:39.657
What is happening?

1180
01:35:30.142 --> 01:35:31.518
American.

1181
01:35:33.437 --> 01:35:35.189

01:36:03.384 --> 01:36:05.135
Come on. Yeah.

1203
01:37:17.624 --> 01:37:19.460
Captain, this isn't right.

1204
01:37:19.585 --> 01:37:23.130
You know this. He's a prisoner.
He surrendered.

1205
01:37:23.797 --> 01:37:25.799
He surrendered, sir!

1206
01:37:36.477 --> 01:37:38.187
Tell him

1207
01:37:40.189 --> 01:37:43.525
to march 1,000 paces in that direction,

1208
01:37:43.650 --> 01:37:44.860
then he can take off the blindfold.

1209
01:37:44.985 --> 01:37:46.028
We'll be gone, and he turns himself in

1210
01:37:46.153 --> 01:37:47.905
to the first Allied patrol
he comes across.

1211
01:37:47.988 --> 01:37:49.031
- Thank you, sir.
- REIBEN: You gotta be kidding me.

1212
01:37:49.156 --> 01:37:51.950
- We're letting him go?
- He's a POW, Reiben.

1213
01:37:52.034 --> 01:37:56.372
Can't take him with us.
Our guys'll pick him up sooner or later.

1214
01:38:07.007 --> 01:38:09.259
Only if he doesn't get picked up
by his own Wehrmacht first,

1215
01:38:09.343 --> 01:38:12.054
then thrown back into circulation.

1216
01:38:14.181 --> 01:38:16.642
Captain, you just let the enemy go.

1217
01:38:16.725 --> 01:38:19.645
- This is such bullshit.
- Y'all got that right.

1218
01:38:19.728 --> 01:38:21.730
Bullshit? Right. This is bullshit?

1219
01:38:21.855 --> 01:38:23.899
- Shooting a prisoner, that'd be okay?
- Upham, shut your mouth.

1220
01:38:24.024 --> 01:38:25.067
It's against the goddamn rules!

1221
01:38:25.192 --> 01:38:29.238
Yeah. The goddamn rules
just walked off with your new friend.

1222
01:38:31.156 --> 01:38:35.411
But I guess that was
the decent thing to do, huh, Captain?

1223
01:38:42.209 --> 01:38:44.545
Get your gear. Let's go.

1224
01:38:47.005 --> 01:38:49.049
You heard him. Gear up.

1225
01:38:50.426 --> 01:38:52.261
The Captain just gave you an order.

1226
01:38:52.344 --> 01:38:56.181
Yeah. Like the one he gave
to take this machine gun.

1227
01:38:56.265 --> 01:38:57.891
That was a real doozy, wasn't it, Sarge.

1228
01:38:57.975 --> 01:38:59.393
Soldier, you are way out of line.

1229
01:38:59.476 --> 01:39:02.729
Yes, sir. That was one hell of a call,
coming to take this nest,

1230
01:39:02.813 --> 01:39:05.566
but what the hell? We only lost
one of our guys, going for it.

1231
01:39:05.649 --> 01:39:07.985
I swear, I hope Mama Ryan's
real fucking happy,

1232
01:39:08.068 --> 01:39:09.278
knowing that little Jimmy's life

1233
01:39:09.361 --> 01:39:11.655
is a little bit more important
than two of our guys!

1234
01:39:11.738 --> 01:39:14.741
But then again, we haven't
found him yet, have we? Huh?

1235
01:39:16.743 --> 01:39:18.162
- HORVATH: Here you go.
- Get the hell off me!

1236
01:39:18.245 --> 01:39:19.997
HORVATH: Reiben, get up.

1237
01:39:21.748 --> 01:39:24.918
Gear up. Fall in.

1238
01:39:29.965 --> 01:39:32.176
I'm done with this mission.

1239
01:39:37.139 --> 01:39:38.765
Hey! Hey!

1240
01:39:40.767 --> 01:39:42.811
- UPHAM: Sir.
- Don't walk away from your Captain.

1241
01:39:42.936 --> 01:39:45.189
- Reiben, get back in line.
- No, sir.

1242
01:39:45.272 --> 01:39:46.648
I'll spend the rest
of my life in the stockade

1243
01:39:46.773 --> 01:39:48.066
if I have to, but I'm done with this.

1244
01:39:48.150 --> 01:39:50.444
- I'm not gonna ask you again, soldier.
- Captain!

1245
01:39:50.527 --> 01:39:51.862
All right, now. This is bullshit!

1246
01:39:51.945 --> 01:39:54.448
- Fall in!
- You're gonna shoot me over Ryan?

1247
01:39:54.531 --> 01:39:55.908
No. I'm gonna shoot you
'cause I don't like you.

1248
01:39:55.991 --> 01:39:57.034
UPHAM: Sir, listen...

1249
01:39:57.117 --> 01:39:58.952
Sir, if he wants to go, just let him go!

1250
01:39:59.036 --> 01:40:02.372
Are you letting this happen?
Captain! You see this?

1251
01:40:02.456 --> 01:40:05.542
- Captain? Sir? Sir, Ryan's dead.
- Bullshit!

1252
01:40:05.626 --> 01:40:08.086
- Sir, we have a situation you might...
- That is bullshit!

1253
01:40:08.170 --> 01:40:10.672
Captain, I have a sixth sense about
these things. I know it in my bones.

1254
01:40:10.797 --> 01:40:13.634
We don't kill that son-of-a-bitch kraut.
Now you're gonna shoot me?

1255
01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:16.220
- He's better than you.
- Then why don't you just do it, Sarge?

1256
01:40:16.303 --> 01:40:17.971
Do it, man. Put one in my leg
and give me that...

1257
01:40:18.096 --> 01:40:20.724
I'm gonna shoot you
in your big goddamn mouth!

1258
01:40:20.807 --> 01:40:22.267
Well, put your money
where your mouth is...

1259
01:40:22.351 --> 01:40:23.727
- You don't know when to shut up.
- Do it!

1260
01:40:23.810 --> 01:40:25.437
- You don't know how to shut up.
- Pull the trigger, already!

1261
01:40:25.521 --> 01:40:26.855
Captain, please!

1262
01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:30.192
- What's the pool on me up to?
- What?

1263
01:40:30.317 --> 01:40:32.986
- You are a coward son of a bitch!
- I'm waiting, Sarge.

1264
01:40:33.111 --> 01:40:36.740
Mike, what's the pool
on me up to right now?

1265
01:40:36.823 --> 01:40:38.659
What's it up to?

1266
01:40:39.284 --> 01:40:43.830
What is it, $300? Is that it? 300?
I'm a schoolteacher.

1267
01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:50.671
I teach English composition

1268
01:40:52.005 --> 01:40:54.174
in this little town called
Addley, Pennsylvania.

1269
01:40:54.299 --> 01:40:56.051
The last 11 years,

1270
01:40:56.843 --> 01:40:59.888
I've been at
Thomas Alva Edison High School.

1271
01:41:01.807 --> 01:41:05.477
I was the coach of the baseball team
in the springtime.

1272
01:41:08.021 --> 01:41:09.690
I'll be doggone.

1273
01:41:10.357 --> 01:41:13.610
MILLER: Back home, when I'd tell people
what I do for a living,

1274
01:41:13.694 --> 01:41:16.655
they'd think, "Well, that figures."

1275
01:41:18.532 --> 01:41:20.742
But over here, it's a...

1276
01:41:22.369 --> 01:41:24.037
A big...

1277
01:41:25.289 --> 01:41:26.957
A big mystery.

1278
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.711
So I guess I've changed some.

1279
01:41:33.380 --> 01:41:36.550
Sometimes I wonder
if I've changed so much

1280
01:41:36.675 --> 01:41:41.221
my wife is even going to recognize me
whenever it is I get back to her.

1281
01:41:42.723 --> 01:41:45.309
And how I'll ever be able to...

1282
01:41:47.853 --> 01:41:50.480
To tell her about days like today.

1283
01:41:53.108 --> 01:41:54.484
Ah! Ryan...

1284
01:41:56.194 --> 01:41:59.364
I don't know anything about Ryan.
I don't care.

1285
01:42:00.032 --> 01:42:03.702
The man means nothing to me,
it's just a name. But if...

1286
01:42:05.537 --> 01:42:08.040
You know, if going to Ramelle

1287
01:42:08.165 --> 01:42:09.666
and finding him, so he can go home,

1288
01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:11.418
if that earns me the right
to get back to my wife

1289
01:42:11.501 --> 01:42:15.756
well, then... Then that's my mission.

1290
01:42:17.841 --> 01:42:19.426
You want to leave?

1291
01:42:19.509 --> 01:42:22.554
You want to go off and fight the war?

1292
01:42:25.432 --> 01:42:26.892
All right.

1293
01:42:28.226 --> 01:42:30.771
All right, I won't stop you.

1294
01:42:30.854 --> 01:42:33.440
I'll even put in the paperwork.

1295
01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:39.780
I just know that every man I kill,
the farther away from home I feel.

Yes, sir. How'd you guess that?

1321
01:46:45.025 --> 01:46:47.986
MILLER: Looks like you guys
got hit pretty hard.

1322

HENDERSON: Yes, sir.
Small unit action.

1323
01:46:54.034 --> 01:46:57.621
They came in,
and beat the hell out of us with 88s.

Tell you what, sir,
if you're our relief,

1325

I'm gonna file a complaint.

HENDERSON: It would have been
Captain Jennings, sir.

1329
01:47:16.389 --> 01:47:20.852
I'm afraid the best we can muster up
right now is a corporal.

1330
01:47:20.936 --> 01:47:23.480
So, what are you guys all about?

1331

01:47:45.418 --> 01:47:47.420
What is this about?

1336
01:47:49.255 --> 01:47:52.092
Your brothers were killed in combat.

1337
01:47:58.890 --> 01:48:00.517
Which ones?

1338
01:48:03.436 --> 01:48:04.938
All of them.

1339
01:48:14.781 --> 01:48:16.408
On the level?

1340
01:48:17.784 --> 01:48:19.786
Yeah. I'm afraid so.

1341
01:48:22.539 --> 01:48:24.457
You might want to take
some time with this.

1342
01:48:24.582 --> 01:48:27.627
If there's someplace
you want to go and...

1343
01:48:36.636 --> 01:48:39.556
- What's this all about?
- Ryan lost his brothers.

1344
01:48:39.639 --> 01:48:41.975
- Which one?
- All of them.

1345
01:48:46.980 --> 01:48:48.314
You...

1346
01:48:50.984 --> 01:48:54.279
You came all the way
out here to tell me that?

1347
01:48:55.989 --> 01:48:58.158
Well, you're going home.

1348
01:48:59.659 --> 01:49:02.245
Our orders are to bring you back.

1349
01:49:05.498 --> 01:49:07.167
Bring me back?

1350
01:49:09.502 --> 01:49:13.006
Corporal Henderson, I don't mean
to leave you even more shorthanded,

1351
01:49:13.131 --> 01:49:14.466
but orders are orders.

1352
01:49:14.549 --> 01:49:17.385
Any communication about when
you're going to be relieved up here?

1353
01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:18.720
Sir, there's no way to tell. I mean,

1354
01:49:18.845 --> 01:49:20.346
we have no idea
what's happening south of us.

1355
01:49:20.472 --> 01:49:21.806
I have my orders, too, sir.

1356
01:49:21.890 --> 01:49:23.767
They don't include me
abandoning my post.

1357
01:49:23.850 --> 01:49:26.770
I understand that,
but this changes things.

1358
01:49:26.853 --> 01:49:29.230
I don't see that it does, sir.

1359
01:49:30.857 --> 01:49:33.860
The Chief of Staff
for the United States Army says it does.

1360
01:49:33.985 --> 01:49:36.821
Sir, our orders are to hold
this bridge at all cost.

1361
01:49:36.905 --> 01:49:39.407
Now, our planes in the 82nd
have taken out every bridge

1362
01:49:39.532 --> 01:49:41.493
across the Merderet
with the exception of two.

1363
01:49:41.576 --> 01:49:43.161
One at Valognes and this one here.

1364
01:49:43.244 --> 01:49:44.496
We let the Germans take them,

1365
01:49:44.579 --> 01:49:46.122
we're gonna lose our foothold
and have to displace.

1366
01:49:46.206 --> 01:49:49.709
MILLER: Private, your outfit
wants to stay, that's one thing.

1367
01:49:49.834 --> 01:49:50.877
But your party's over here.

1368
01:49:51.002 --> 01:49:53.171
Sir, I can't leave
until at least reinforcements...

1369
01:49:53.254 --> 01:49:55.673
You got three minutes
to gather your gear.

1370
01:49:55.757 --> 01:49:57.842
Sir, what about them?
I mean, there's barely hardly enough...

1371
01:49:57.926 --> 01:49:59.427
REIBEN: Hey, asshole!

1372
01:50:00.178 --> 01:50:04.057
Two of our guys already died
trying to find you, all right?

1373
01:50:09.062 --> 01:50:11.773
- Sir?
- That's right.

1374
01:50:21.658 --> 01:50:26.162
- What were their names?
- Irwin Wade and Adrian Caparzo.

1375
01:50:28.123 --> 01:50:29.666
Wade and...

1376
01:50:31.167 --> 01:50:32.585
Caparzo.

1377
01:50:45.014 --> 01:50:47.433
(WHISPERS) It doesn't make any sense.

1378
01:50:49.519 --> 01:50:53.773
It doesn't make sense, sir.
Why? Why do I deserve to go?

1379
01:50:53.857 --> 01:50:58.027
Why not any of these guys?
They all fought just as hard as me!

1380
01:51:01.656 --> 01:51:04.742
Is that what they're
supposed to tell your mother

1381
01:51:04.826 --> 01:51:08.163
when they send her another
folded American flag?

1382
01:51:15.378 --> 01:51:17.797
Tell her that when you found me,

1383
01:51:17.881 --> 01:51:21.551
I was here and I was
with the only brothers that I have left,

1384
01:51:21.634 --> 01:51:24.888
and that there's no way
I was gonna desert them.

1385
01:51:26.055 --> 01:51:28.224
I think she'll understand that.

1386
01:51:28.308 --> 01:51:31.311
There's no way I'm leaving this bridge.

1387
01:52:14.312 --> 01:52:16.356
What are your orders?

1388
01:52:18.191 --> 01:52:21.569
Sergeant, we have crossed
some strange boundary here.

1389
01:52:22.528 --> 01:52:25.156
The world has taken a turn
for the surreal.

1390
01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:28.076
Clearly, but the question still stands.

1391
01:52:28.743 --> 01:52:31.704
I don't know. What do you think?

1392
01:52:32.789 --> 01:52:35.583
HORVATH: You don't want to know
what I think.

1393
01:52:37.460 --> 01:52:39.128
No, Mike, I do.

1394
01:52:40.838 --> 01:52:44.133
Well, part of me thinks the kid's right.

1395
01:52:44.217 --> 01:52:46.761
What's he done to deserve this?

1396
01:52:46.844 --> 01:52:50.807
He wants to stay here, fine,
let's leave him and go home.

1397
01:52:52.058 --> 01:52:53.351
Yeah.

1398
01:52:53.893 --> 01:52:59.023
But another part of me thinks
what if, by some miracle, we stay

1399
01:52:59.107 --> 01:53:01.734
and actually make it out of here?

1400
01:53:02.652 --> 01:53:06.281
Someday we might look back on this
and decide that

1401
01:53:06.364 --> 01:53:09.784
saving Private Ryan
was the one decent thing

1402
01:53:09.867 --> 01:53:12.787
we were able to pull out of this whole

1403
01:53:12.870 --> 01:53:14.998
God-awful, shitty mess.

1404
01:53:16.666 --> 01:53:19.168
That's what I was thinking, sir.

1405
01:53:20.336 --> 01:53:22.505
Like you said, Captain,

1406
01:53:24.299 --> 01:53:26.009
we do that,

1407
01:53:26.467 --> 01:53:29.262
we all earn the right to go home.

1408
01:53:32.140 --> 01:53:33.683
Oh, brother.

1409
01:53:37.145 --> 01:53:39.439
TRASK: This is everything.

1410
01:53:40.189 --> 01:53:45.820
You got the two 30-caliber machine
guns, 17 grenades, 11 Hawkins mines.

1411
01:53:46.571 --> 01:53:49.907
You got the two bazookas,
but they only got eight rounds left,

1412
01:53:49.991 --> 01:53:52.201
and assorted small arms.

1413
01:53:52.285 --> 01:53:55.788
We had a 60 mortar
but an arty round took it out.

1414
01:53:55.872 --> 01:53:58.541
Might as well be spit wads
if they roll on us with tanks.

1415
01:53:58.624 --> 01:54:01.878
- Which they're sure to do.
- What are you thinking, sir?

1416
01:54:01.961 --> 01:54:06.591
Well, I'm thinking they're going to try
to whip around the flanks.

1417
01:54:11.137 --> 01:54:13.431
Unless we can draw
them up this main road here

1418
01:54:13.514 --> 01:54:14.640
in between these buildings

1419
01:54:14.724 --> 01:54:18.686
where all the rubble makes
a bit of a bottleneck.

1420
01:54:18.770 --> 01:54:20.813
- Disable 'em?
- If we can.

1421
01:54:20.897 --> 01:54:22.482
Make that tank a 60-ton roadblock.

1422
01:54:22.565 --> 01:54:24.400
We do that, we got
a fighting chance at their flanks.

1423
01:54:24.484 --> 01:54:26.903
Yes, sir that's good. Split them up.
Don't let them mass anywhere.

1424
01:54:26.986 --> 01:54:29.947
Hit them hard as we can, one-on-one,
and fall back to the bridge.

1425
01:54:30.031 --> 01:54:32.241
Machine gun on the move down here,
and number two up high somewhere

1426
01:54:32.325 --> 01:54:34.369
to piss a little bad news down
on their heads.

1427
01:54:34.452 --> 01:54:36.662
MILLER: That would be the idea.

1428
01:54:37.246 --> 01:54:38.706
Jackson.

1429
01:54:39.332 --> 01:54:41.626
If we can, I'd like to get you up
in that bell tower.

1430
01:54:41.709 --> 01:54:42.710
Yes, sir.

1431
01:54:42.794 --> 01:54:44.754
Give you a little company
if you need it.

1432
01:54:44.837 --> 01:54:46.881
Yes, sir. Some company couldn't hurt.

1433
01:54:46.964 --> 01:54:51.010
I'd say a.30 with about
1,000 rounds would be okay.

1434
01:54:51.094 --> 01:54:53.137
Parker, job opportunity.

1435
01:54:53.221 --> 01:54:55.223
Yeah. Well, it's not the worst idea
ever, Captain.

1436
01:54:55.306 --> 01:54:56.891
It's just that everything depends
on getting the tank

1437
01:54:56.974 --> 01:54:59.060
down this main road for us
to knock out, right?

1438
01:54:59.185 --> 01:55:02.230
So how the hell do you
plan on doing that?

1439
01:55:02.688 --> 01:55:03.731
HORVATH: Reiben's right.

1440
01:55:03.815 --> 01:55:05.650
As our esteemed colleague
from the Airborne pointed out,

1441
01:55:05.733 --> 01:55:08.027
what we got here are
a bunch of spit wads,

1442
01:55:08.111 --> 01:55:11.948
so how do we stop the tank
if we get it to commit?

1443
01:55:12.031 --> 01:55:14.450
Give it a rabbit to chase.

1444
01:55:14.534 --> 01:55:17.703
We could hit the tank in the tracks.

1445
01:55:17.787 --> 01:55:19.872
Yeah, but with what?

1446
01:55:21.582 --> 01:55:25.420
- Well, we could try a sticky bomb.
- RYAN: Sticky bomb, sir?

1447
01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:30.466
- Sir, are you making that up?
- No. It's in the field manual.

1448
01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:32.427
You check it out if you want to.

1449
01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:34.595
RYAN: We seem to be out
of field manuals, sir.

1450
01:55:34.679 --> 01:55:36.597
Perhaps you can enlighten us?

1451
01:55:36.681 --> 01:55:38.141
All right, you have
some demolition, don't you?

1452
01:55:38.224 --> 01:55:40.184
Some TNT or some composition B?

1453
01:55:40.268 --> 01:55:41.978
Yeah, that, sir, is the one thing
we got plenty of.

1454
01:55:42.061 --> 01:55:44.730
I got that bridge wired with enough
composition B to blow it twice.

1455
01:55:44.814 --> 01:55:46.816
All right. You can spare some, then.

1456
01:55:46.899 --> 01:55:50.153
You take a standard-issue GI sock,

1457
01:55:50.236 --> 01:55:53.364
cram it with as much
comp B as it can hold,

1458
01:55:53.448 --> 01:55:55.908
rig up a simple fuse,

1459
01:55:55.992 --> 01:55:58.536
then you coat the whole thing
with axle grease.

1460
01:55:58.619 --> 01:56:00.788
That way, when you throw it,

1461
01:56:00.872 --> 01:56:03.124
it should stick.
It's a bomb that sticks.

1462
01:56:03.207 --> 01:56:04.834
It's a sticky bomb.

1463
01:56:04.917 --> 01:56:07.336
You come up with a better way
to knock the tracks off a tank,

1464
01:56:07.420 --> 01:56:09.046
I'm all ears.

1465
01:56:09.130 --> 01:56:12.675
This is good.
Now we got to surrender our socks.

1466
01:56:27.148 --> 01:56:28.649
Haul away.

1467
01:56:42.663 --> 01:56:44.665
All right, select the field of fire.

1468
01:56:44.749 --> 01:56:46.584
Crossfire with the one
in the bell tower.

1469
01:56:46.667 --> 01:56:49.962
All right, I can cover
12 to nine from here.

1470
01:56:53.216 --> 01:56:55.301
- Easy!
- I got her!

1471
01:57:29.669 --> 01:57:31.546
Here are the mines.

1472
01:57:42.473 --> 01:57:44.892
For being the best we can do,

1473
01:57:44.976 --> 01:57:48.980
that forward machine gun
is not in a terrible firing position.

1474
01:57:51.649 --> 01:57:54.151
And this position right here,

1475
01:57:56.195 --> 01:57:57.822
this is the Alamo.

1476
01:57:58.406 --> 01:58:02.076
They push us back this far,
last man alive blows the bridge.

1477
01:58:02.159 --> 01:58:04.203
We only got a 30-second delay
on that fuse,

1478
01:58:04.287 --> 01:58:06.330
so let everyone know that
if you are that last man

1479
01:58:06.414 --> 01:58:10.501
you better hurry your ass off,
or you're not going to be alive long.

1480
01:58:10.585 --> 01:58:14.005
Captain? Where am I during all this?

1481
01:58:14.922 --> 01:58:16.882
Never more than
two feet away from me,

1482
01:58:16.966 --> 01:58:19.176
and that's not negotiable.

1483
01:58:20.303 --> 01:58:22.722
I'll get some ammo. Come on.

1484
01:58:25.766 --> 01:58:27.059
- Hey, Upham.
- Yes.

1485
01:58:27.143 --> 01:58:29.020
- Listen to me, all right?
- Yeah.

1486
01:58:29.103 --> 01:58:30.646
- You're listening?
- Yes.

1487
01:58:30.730 --> 01:58:32.815
All right, we're gonna be displacing

1488
01:58:32.898 --> 01:58:34.525
and falling back like crazy
sons of bitches.

1489
01:58:34.609 --> 01:58:35.693
Right up there.

1490
01:58:35.776 --> 01:58:39.238
So you got to be Johnny on the spot
with the ammo, or we're dead.

1491
01:58:39.322 --> 01:58:41.032
- Right.
- You understand that?

1492
01:58:41.115 --> 01:58:43.409
- Johnny on the spot.
- Yeah.

1493
01:58:43.492 --> 01:58:46.621
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yes.

1494
01:58:46.912 --> 01:58:48.205
You know, when we were
shipping out of England

1495
01:58:48.289 --> 01:58:50.249
the supply sergeant was handing
out cartons of cigarettes,

1496
01:58:50.333 --> 01:58:53.419
and I said "No, thank you,
I don't smoke."

1497
01:58:54.420 --> 01:58:56.047
"I don't smoke."

1498
01:58:57.882 --> 01:59:00.843
- Quite a situation, huh?
- Unbelievable.

1499
01:59:02.178 --> 01:59:07.725

1511
02:00:22.174 --> 02:00:23.759

1512
02:00:23.843 --> 02:00:27.346

everywhere she goes.

1513
02:00:28.514 --> 02:00:30.391

Sorry, it's Edith, you know.

1534
02:02:02.858 --> 02:02:04.860
You know what
that song reminds me of?

1535
02:02:04.944 --> 02:02:07.655
It reminds me of Mrs. Rachel Troubowitz
and what she said to me

1536
02:02:07.738 --> 02:02:09.240
the day I left for basic.

1537
02:02:09.323 --> 02:02:11.867
What, "Don't touch me"?

1538
02:02:11.951 --> 02:02:14.537
No. Mrs. Rachel Troubowitz
is our super's wife.

1539
02:02:14.620 --> 02:02:17.456
She comes into my mom's shop
to try on a few things, all right?

1540
02:02:17.540 --> 02:02:21.335
And she's easily, like, a 44 double E.

1541
02:02:21.418 --> 02:02:23.045
- Double E?
- These things are massive.

1542
02:02:23.128 --> 02:02:24.380
Those are big.

1543
02:02:24.463 --> 02:02:27.842
No. And I've got her convinced
that she's, like, a 42 D, all right?

1544
02:02:27.925 --> 02:02:29.635
So we're in the dressing room,
she's trying to squeeze

1545
02:02:29.718 --> 02:02:33.180
into this side-cut,
silk-ribboned, triple-panel girdle

1546
02:02:33.305 --> 02:02:35.516
with the shelf-lift brassiere.

1547
02:02:35.599 --> 02:02:38.185
And it's beautiful 'cause she's just
pouring out of this thing, you know?

1548
02:02:38.269 --> 02:02:40.020
- Is it really tight?
- No, no. It's beautiful.

1549
02:02:40.104 --> 02:02:41.564
And she sees me, and she can tell

1550
02:02:41.647 --> 02:02:44.275
I got a hard-on the size
of the Statue of Liberty, all right?

1551
02:02:44.358 --> 02:02:46.402
And she says to me,
"Richard, calm down."

1552
02:02:46.485 --> 02:02:48.988
And she says, "When you're over there,

1553
02:02:49.071 --> 02:02:50.948
"if you see anything that upsets you,

1554

1556
02:02:58.706 --> 02:03:00.833

RYAN: Are you all right, sir?

1558
02:03:17.099 --> 02:03:19.852
Yeah, I'm just keeping the rhythm.

1559
02:03:24.773 --> 02:03:27.693
Is it true you were
a teacher back home?

1560
02:03:28.777 --> 02:03:30.237
Yes.

1561
02:03:30.321 --> 02:03:32.656

you know.

treated our teachers. No, sir.

1563

I had 1,000 kids like you.

1564
02:03:48.213 --> 02:03:50.925
I can't see my brothers' faces.

1565
02:03:52.259 --> 02:03:54.970
I've been trying,
and I can't see their faces at all.

1566
02:03:55.054 --> 02:03:57.264
Has that ever happened to you?

1567
02:03:57.348 --> 02:03:59.725
You gotta think of a context.

1568
02:04:01.936 --> 02:04:04.063
What does that mean?

1569
02:04:04.146 --> 02:04:05.689
Well, you don't just think
about their faces.

1570
02:04:05.773 --> 02:04:10.402
You think about something specific,
something you've done together.

1571
02:04:14.156 --> 02:04:17.117
Well, when I think of home,
I think of something specific.

1572
02:04:17.201 --> 02:04:20.287
I think of my hammock in the backyard,

1573
02:04:21.121 --> 02:04:25.459
or my wife pruning the rose bushes
in a pair of my old work gloves.

1574
02:04:29.755 --> 02:04:33.092
This one night, two of my brothers came

1575
02:04:33.175 --> 02:04:36.178
and woke me up in
the middle of the night,

1576
02:04:37.012 --> 02:04:40.057
and they said
they had a surprise for me.

1577
02:04:40.599 --> 02:04:43.769
So they took me to the barn,
up into the loft,

1578
02:04:43.852 --> 02:04:46.814
and there was my oldest brother Dan

1579
02:04:47.940 --> 02:04:51.026
(LAUGHING) with Alice. Alice Jardine.

1580
02:04:53.988 --> 02:04:58.200
I mean, picture a girl who just took
a nosedive from the ugly tree

1581
02:04:58.283 --> 02:05:00.911
and hit every branch coming down.

1582
02:05:02.830 --> 02:05:05.499
And Dan's got her shirt off.

1583
02:05:05.582 --> 02:05:08.377
So he's working on this bra
and he's trying to get it off

1584
02:05:08.460 --> 02:05:11.672
and all of a sudden,
Sean just screams out,

1585
02:05:12.506 --> 02:05:15.884
"Danny, you're a young man!
Don't do it!"

1586
02:05:18.470 --> 02:05:22.016
And so Alice Jardine hears this
and she screams, and she jumps up,

1587
02:05:22.141 --> 02:05:23.767
and she tries to get
running out of the barn,

1588
02:05:23.851 --> 02:05:25.060
but she's still got this shirt
over her head.

1589
02:05:25.144 --> 02:05:29.356
She goes running right into the wall
and knocks herself out.

1590
02:05:29.481 --> 02:05:33.652
So now Dan is just so mad at us,
he starts coming after us,

1591
02:05:33.736 --> 02:05:36.113
but at the same time,
Alice is over there unconscious.

1592
02:05:36.196 --> 02:05:37.698
He's got to wake her up.

1593
02:05:37.823 --> 02:05:41.076
So he grabs her by a leg
and he's dragging her.

1594
02:05:41.160 --> 02:05:44.371
At the same time, he picks up a shovel
and he's going after Sean.

1595
02:05:44.496 --> 02:05:46.623
And Sean said,
"What are you trying to hit me for?

1596
02:05:46.707 --> 02:05:48.834
"I just did you a favor."

1597
02:05:50.669 --> 02:05:52.546
And so this makes Dan more angry.

1598
02:05:52.671 --> 02:05:55.591
He tries to swing this thing.
He loses the shovel.

1599
02:05:55.674 --> 02:05:58.385
It goes out of his grasp
and hits a kerosene lantern.

1600
02:05:58.510 --> 02:06:01.096
The thing explodes,
the whole barn almost goes up

1601
02:06:01.180 --> 02:06:03.348
because of this thing.

1602
02:06:18.197 --> 02:06:20.115
That was it. That was the last...
That was...

1603
02:06:20.199 --> 02:06:21.784
Dan went off to basic next day.
