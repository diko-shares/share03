00:00:06,699 --> 00:00:09,538
I see all these girls coming on to
him. I think he might be gay.

2
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:12,418
We have found a spacious,
rent-free hall.

3
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:14,618
You mean you're moving
into the community centre?

4
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:18,378
We're going to be flatmates.

5
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:21,538
I'm your new probation worker.
You cross me

6
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,178
and I will...

7
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:25,458
fuck you like you have
never been fucked before.

8
00:00:25,549 --> 00:00:26,948
Who are you?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,959
I'm Lola.
I'm a trainee probation worker.

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,919
You're a trainee probation worker?

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,919
Is that going to be
a problem for you?

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,159
Get your stuff. Time to go.

13
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,719
Where to?

14
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,719
Take me home.

15
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,719
Looks like rain.

16
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,519
Will you behave?

17
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,119
Honestly it's shaping up to be
a beautiful day, this.

18
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,119
It's full of wonder, and endless
possibility. Look at it.

20
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,159
Are you sure you don't need it?

21
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,159
No. Take it. It's yours.

22
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,759
Look at you. All grown up.

23
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,599
I remember
when you used to have nightmares.

24
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,599
You used to get into bed -
my bed - and we'd snuggle up.

25
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,839
You were all... snuggly.

26
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,319
Was I?

27
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,319
Look, just because me and your dad
aren't together any more...

28
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,119
You know I'm still here for you,
right?

29
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,559
Sure.

30
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,559
Great. I think we're good to go.

31
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,399
OK.

32
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,119
So... that was fucking weird, eh?

33
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,039
What?

34
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,399
The thing with your step-mum
coming onto you.

35
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,639
What? She wasn't!

36
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,479
Mmm.

37
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,319
That? That's just how she is.

38
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,439
She's... she's very affectionate.

39
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,679
When she wants to fuck someone.

40
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,119
She used to have sex with me dad.

41
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,519
You know, there are bounds,
whatever they are,

42
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,359
and we - me and her...

43
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,199
I'm out of them and so is she.
Just out of bounds.

44
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,199
So if I'd have had sex with your
dad, you wouldn't sleep with me?

45
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,879
Jesus.

46
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,159
Now I've got an image of you
having sex with me dad.

47
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,159
Uh-huh.

48
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,759
Was it from behind?

49
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,759
It is now!

50
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,239
I fucked your mum.

51
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,399
I didn't.

52
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,399
So, new TV. Big moment. You could
come over later and watch a DVD.

53
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,199
You live in the Community Centre.

54
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,759
I'm not going all the way home
and coming back, again.

55
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,719
You could not go home
and watch a DVD.

56
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,719
All right. Just as long as you're
not one of those man-child wankers

57
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,239
who's obsessed with Star Wars.

58
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,279
It's Harry Potter with me.

59
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,959
You know what really intrigued me
about the whole franchise?

60
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,639
At what point does it become OK
to want to fuck Hermione?

61
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,559
Me? I'm a Goblet Of Fire man.

62
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,119
Yeah? Yeah.

63
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,519
Eh, don't forget to sign on.
How do they expect us to survive

64
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,679
on single benefits when there's
two of us?

65
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,679
I'm not sure the benefit system was
designed for situations like ours.

66
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,959
Go and see Mum and Dad.

67
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,839
See if you can't guilt-trip them
into giving you some money.

68
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,879
Steal if you have to.

69
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,519
Dad usually keeps a couple of quid

70
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,519
under that crappy polar bear
paperweight thing.

71
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,159
Look, I'm not your slave.

72
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,119
Go and get some crisps.
Cheese and onion.

73
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,399
No, fuck it,
let's go exotic - prawn cocktail.

74
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,319
Do you want to be Rudy One,
or do you want to be Rudy Two?

75
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,319
I'll be Rudy Too -
spelled T, double O, because I am.

76
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,519
I get it. Will you...
What's wrong with me toothbrush?

77
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,199
You don't have a toothbrush.

78
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,399
I'm sharing with Finn.

79
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,479
Does he know that?

80
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,879
Does he need to know that?

81
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,599
Look, you take care of your teeth
and I'll take care of mine.

82
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,319
You really are a petty,
selfish little man.

83
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,319
There's no crisps for you.
Just fuck off.

84
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,319
Yeah.

85
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,599
Fuck it.

86
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,759
"I'll be Rudy Too - T, double O,
because I am." You fucking...

87
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,599
What, did you forget something?

88
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,359
Is that a ukulele? What the bloody
hell are you doing with that?

89
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,039
You know them things
remind me of him.

90
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,879
Yeah, well, when you're locked
in a prison cell 23 hours a day,

91
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,879
there's not much else to do than
masturbate and play ukulele.

92
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,319
What? No hug?

93
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,519
What are you doing here?

94
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,079
I came to see you.

95
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,679
I feel at least you owe me
an apology for getting me sent down.

96
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,719
I don't know what you're
talking about, mate.

97
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,719
You two sent me out to get us
some Curly Wurlys.

98
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,279
The police just so happened to know
exactly where I'd be.

99
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,519
You're a fucking psychopath.
You're a liability, mate.

100
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,279
You nearly battered that guy
half to death.

101
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,599
I taught him a valuable lesson.

102
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,879
You bit his frigging ear off.

103
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,119
He should've listened.

104
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,879
What's the point in having ears
if you don't use them?
Yeah, what about his nose?

105
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,159
His nose was just for the comedy.

106
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,839
I've got a present for you.

107
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,839
Have you?

108
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,319
I believe this is yours.

109
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,119
Ah, you're all right.
I've gone off them.

110
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,439
They're... they're very sugary.
You know...

111
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,439
Take it.

112
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,079
Take it.
I don't want to.

113
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,079
Take the fucking candy bar, take it!
Take it, take it.

114
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,399
Fuck it.

115
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,639
What do you say?

116
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,439
Thank you.

117
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,439
That wasn't so bad, was it?

118
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,239
Please, please...

119
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,519
Bye-bye.

120
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,719
Oh, you handsome bastard.

121
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,679
Hello.

122
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,519
Was there something you wanted?

123
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,759
I like watching other people work.

124
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,199
You can take over if you like.

125
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,879
Nah, I'm good, thanks.

126
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,919
Now scrub the fucking wall.

127
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,559
Are you allowed to talk to us
like that?

128
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,879
Are you going to report me?

129
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,439
Scrub it.

130
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,439
Fuck you.

131
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,999
Is this some kind of power trip
to you?

132
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,879
Now he's getting it.

133
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,879
You know, maybe I came down here
last night

134
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,439
and graffitied all over the walls

135
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,279
just so I could watch you
scrub it off.

136
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,239
Yeah. Right.

137
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,239
Sure you did.

138
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,639
You intrigue me.

139
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,639
Just to restate the obvious,
me and you is never going to happen.

140
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,319
From what I can see, it isn't
going to happen with anyone.

141
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,559
When was the last time
you even got laid?

142
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,519
Fuck off.

143
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,359
Has it been a while?

144
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,359
What are we talking, like,
a couple of months? Six?

145
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,199
A year?

146
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,439
How do you know it still works?

147
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,439
One thing's for certain.
You'll never find out.

148
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,159
What happened?

149
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,159
Did someone hurt you?

150
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,879
You don't know anything about me,
so don't act like you do.

151
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,959
You act all tough and sassy.
That's an act.

152
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,639
I see right through you.

153
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,919
Take your hand off me.

154
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,759
Or what?

155
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,239
We're just talking.

156
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,679
You stay the fuck away from me.

157
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,679
I can't, I can't do that now.
I'm drawn to you.

158
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,559
You're special.
I enjoyed our little chat.

159
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,119
To be continued, yeah?

160
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,967
You're acting again.

161
00:13:14,636 --> 00:13:18,135
We forgot the remote control
for the TV. There's no remote.

162
00:13:18,205 --> 00:13:20,324
And to a guy,
that's like losing a testicle.

163
00:13:20,325 --> 00:13:22,484
It's like losing three testicles.

164
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:24,124
We need to go round to
Lisa's to get it.

165
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,244
And by "we", I mean you need to
drive me round there.

166
00:13:26,245 --> 00:13:30,044
And there's no way you can just get
up and walk over to the TV
when you need to change channels?

167
00:13:30,045 --> 00:13:33,044
Is that a joke? This isn't the '70s.

168
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:37,044
OK. Whatever.

169
00:13:48,805 --> 00:13:52,804
Are you OK?

170
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:57,044
This whole thing with inviting me
over to watch a DVD.

171
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,844
It's cos you want to
get in my knickers, right?

172
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:02,964
Is that a trick question?

173
00:14:02,965 --> 00:14:04,524
I just want you to be
straight with me.

174
00:14:04,525 --> 00:14:06,164
It's not a deal breaker.

175
00:14:06,165 --> 00:14:09,484
It's not like I need to be fingering
a girl to enjoy a movie,

176
00:14:09,485 --> 00:14:10,764
you know far from it.

177
00:14:10,765 --> 00:14:13,884
I mean if we're going there,
I'll settle for a kiss,

178
00:14:13,885 --> 00:14:16,404
maybe a feel of your tits.

179
00:14:16,405 --> 00:14:19,324
Are we haggling?
I feel like I'm in a Moroccan souk.

180
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:22,404
Go and get the remote control.

181
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:26,404
Right.

182
00:14:32,645 --> 00:14:36,644
I forgot the remote control.

183
00:14:44,645 --> 00:14:45,764
Were you checking me out?

184
00:14:45,765 --> 00:14:49,764
What? No. Who? I, I was...

185
00:14:50,845 --> 00:14:52,564
The remote control. Thank God.

186
00:14:52,565 --> 00:14:54,524
It's like losing three testicles.

187
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:58,484
Finn, relax. It's not like you
haven't seen my arse before.

188
00:14:58,485 --> 00:15:01,004
At least you think I've got
something worth looking at.

189
00:15:01,005 --> 00:15:05,004
I should probably go.

190
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:06,284
What?

191
00:15:06,285 --> 00:15:10,284
When I was with your dad,
did you fancy me?

192
00:15:10,565 --> 00:15:14,204
No. Why would you? You're...
No.

193
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:18,204
Well, I'm closer to your age
than I am your dad's.

194
00:15:18,965 --> 00:15:20,604
I know what teenage boys are like.

195
00:15:20,605 --> 00:15:24,604
Not this one. I'm like exams,
sport, girls me own age.

196
00:15:25,885 --> 00:15:29,884
I know you used to, um, masturbate
over those topless photos of me.

197
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:34,124
You've got the wrong guy.

198
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:38,124
Er, I found them
hidden under your mattress.

199
00:15:39,045 --> 00:15:40,844
You know I...

200
00:15:40,845 --> 00:15:44,844
probably
shouldn't say this but... I liked it.

201
00:15:48,445 --> 00:15:52,004
The thought of you...

202
00:15:52,005 --> 00:15:55,284
touching yourself
while you looked at me.

203
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:56,764
Long time ago. It's all a blur.

204
00:15:56,765 --> 00:15:58,764
Can I please just get
the remote control?

205
00:15:58,765 --> 00:16:02,284
Sure.

206
00:16:02,285 --> 00:16:03,324
Thanks.

207
00:16:03,325 --> 00:16:05,804
I still think of you, looking at me.

208
00:16:05,805 --> 00:16:07,564
That's nice.

209
00:16:09,725 --> 00:16:11,684
Are you out of your fucking mind?

210
00:16:11,685 --> 00:16:14,644
I think about you and me.

211
00:16:14,645 --> 00:16:17,044
You shouldn't be doing that.

212
00:16:17,045 --> 00:16:18,284
Oh, yeah?
No.

213
00:16:18,285 --> 00:16:19,764
What the fuck!?

214
00:16:19,765 --> 00:16:23,044
No, no, no. Don't do, don't do that.

215
00:16:23,045 --> 00:16:25,924
No, no! Yes, yes...

216
00:16:44,405 --> 00:16:48,404
Shall we go to bed?

217
00:16:48,885 --> 00:16:52,884
I just need to use your bathroom.

218
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:07,884
One remote control.
Mission accomplished.

219
00:17:07,885 --> 00:17:09,964
Let's go.
Are you OK?

220
00:17:09,965 --> 00:17:12,244
I'm good. Remote control in hand.

221
00:17:12,245 --> 00:17:15,684
Start the engine.

222
00:17:15,685 --> 00:17:19,684
You come in my mouth and then you
go running back to your girlfriend!

223
00:17:19,765 --> 00:17:22,644
Good one. She's hilarious.
Mental. Drive the car.

224
00:17:22,645 --> 00:17:25,324
Your boyfriend just
put his cock in my mouth.

225
00:17:25,325 --> 00:17:27,804
In her dreams.

226
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:31,204
Jess. I'm sorry. It was an accident!

227
00:17:31,205 --> 00:17:34,964
These things happen!

228
00:17:34,965 --> 00:17:38,964
I'm such a mess.
I'm such a fucking mess.

229
00:17:46,205 --> 00:17:49,804
Probably best not to tell me dad
about any of this.

230
00:17:49,805 --> 00:17:51,124
I really don't see it
helping anyone.

231
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:54,124
You're walking away?

232
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:58,124
You're just like him,
you're just like your dad.

233
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:01,044
He's definitely taller.

234
00:18:01,045 --> 00:18:02,724
I thought you liked me?

235
00:18:02,725 --> 00:18:06,124
I do.

236
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,364
I like your hair.

237
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:11,244
I just...

238
00:18:11,245 --> 00:18:15,244
I have to...
I've left a chicken in the oven.

239
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:50,884
I went to go and see Mum and Dad.

240
00:18:50,885 --> 00:18:51,924
Mum's not very happy.

241
00:18:51,925 --> 00:18:55,484
She says she caught Dad
staring at some woman's tits
in the Happy Eater.

242
00:18:55,485 --> 00:18:59,484
Dad said he was admiring her blouse,
which seems very unlikely.

243
00:19:02,885 --> 00:19:06,764
I don't know why
he puts up wi' her shit.

244
00:19:06,765 --> 00:19:10,764
He should cave her skull in with
that crappy polar bear paperweight.

245
00:19:12,365 --> 00:19:13,924
What's up with you?

246
00:19:13,925 --> 00:19:15,764
It's more a question
of what's in me.

247
00:19:15,765 --> 00:19:19,764
Have you taken an E?

248
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,764
You're high enough as it is.

249
00:19:21,765 --> 00:19:24,324
I'm, I'm sitting this one out,
thank you very much.

250
00:19:24,325 --> 00:19:28,324
Absolutely ridiculous
idea you stu...

251
00:19:30,885 --> 00:19:32,524
It's you.

252
00:19:32,525 --> 00:19:34,844
Nice to see me, to see me.

253
00:19:34,845 --> 00:19:37,204
What have you done wi' him?

254
00:19:37,205 --> 00:19:38,764
Where's Rudy one?

255
00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:41,404
He's in here. Ain't he?

256
00:19:41,405 --> 00:19:42,964
What d'you want?

257
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:45,404
If you want to get psychological?

258
00:19:45,405 --> 00:19:49,404
I reckon Freud would probably say
I wanted to fuck me mum.

259
00:19:51,605 --> 00:19:55,204
I'd say, "Freud you haven't seen our
mum lately. Maybe Auntie Barbara."

260
00:19:55,205 --> 00:19:56,924
Auntie Barbara's dead.

261
00:19:56,925 --> 00:19:59,804
Well then, I guess
she's off the menu.

262
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:03,804
We'll leave town.
We'll do whatever you want.

263
00:20:03,925 --> 00:20:05,204
Just please let him go.

264
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:07,564
You think he's your friend?

265
00:20:07,565 --> 00:20:11,564
When I pitched up here this morning,
he had your toothbrush up his arse.

266
00:20:14,325 --> 00:20:15,764
It was a joke man!

267
00:20:15,765 --> 00:20:18,564
Get back in there, you.

268
00:20:18,565 --> 00:20:22,564
That's the last we'll hear from you.

269
00:20:22,845 --> 00:20:26,844
Bollocks.

270
00:20:34,965 --> 00:20:38,964
Fuck.

271
00:21:44,673 --> 00:21:46,352
So that was weird, right?

272
00:21:46,362 --> 00:21:49,361
The whole crazy thing with Lisa.
I can explain.

273
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,219
You can explain how you fucked her?

274
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,859
I didn't fuck her. Who's that?

275
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,659
His stepmum.
He's a stepmother-fucker.

276
00:21:56,745 --> 00:21:58,104
Oh, man!

277
00:21:58,105 --> 00:22:01,004
One, she isn't me stepmum
and two, I didn't fuck her.

278
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:02,932
She just sucked him off.

279
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:04,032
You're a stepmother-sucker?

280
00:22:04,126 --> 00:22:05,445
One, I didn't suck anything.

281
00:22:05,446 --> 00:22:07,365
Two, she's a woman,
she hasn't got a penis.

282
00:22:07,366 --> 00:22:09,365
Oh, she's the stepmother-sucker.

283
00:22:09,366 --> 00:22:13,365
No! One, she isn't me stepmum. Two...

284
00:22:14,206 --> 00:22:15,685
Can we talk about something else?

285
00:22:15,686 --> 00:22:18,085
So she did suck you off?

286
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:22,045
Only technically.
It was an accident.

287
00:22:22,046 --> 00:22:24,565
You tripped
and inserted your cock in her mouth?

288
00:22:24,566 --> 00:22:28,245
We're in the kitchen and suddenly
she starts going down on me.

289
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:32,245
Before I could stop her, she gets me
out and rams it in her...

290
00:22:33,206 --> 00:22:35,205
and I was like, "Whoa!"
And then I was like...

291
00:22:35,206 --> 00:22:37,925
Coming in her mouth.

292
00:22:37,926 --> 00:22:40,765
Thank you. I think everyone got it.

293
00:22:40,766 --> 00:22:44,205
If you really wanted to stop her,
you could have grabbed a fork

294
00:22:44,206 --> 00:22:47,925
and then rammed it in her eye.

295
00:22:47,926 --> 00:22:49,085
Perhaps a little extreme?

296
00:22:49,086 --> 00:22:52,325
Why don't you just tell the truth?

297
00:22:52,326 --> 00:22:54,285
Oh, I'm sure you put up
a huge fight,

298
00:22:54,286 --> 00:22:57,485
but then you felt the tip
of your cock slide into her mouth

299
00:22:57,486 --> 00:23:01,485
and it were all warm, weren't it?
And wet and grabby.

300
00:23:01,726 --> 00:23:05,445
"I am getting my dick sucked!
I am fucking invincible!"

301
00:23:05,446 --> 00:23:09,125
You just had to spray your seed
down the back of her throat,

302
00:23:09,126 --> 00:23:10,765
you couldn't help yourself.

303
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:12,125
Do you know why?

304
00:23:12,126 --> 00:23:16,125
Cos you're pathetic.

305
00:23:19,126 --> 00:23:23,125
You deserve better.

306
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:30,165
Prick. Aren't you?

307
00:23:35,566 --> 00:23:37,965
Someone's got his period. Jess.

308
00:23:37,966 --> 00:23:41,965
You're full of shit.

309
00:23:43,246 --> 00:23:46,645
Stepmother-sucker. Sweet.

310
00:23:46,646 --> 00:23:50,645
She isn't my step...

311
00:23:52,246 --> 00:23:54,885
What are you doing?

312
00:23:54,886 --> 00:23:58,885
Nothing. I wasn't doing anything.

313
00:24:00,686 --> 00:24:04,165
Don't lie to me.

314
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:08,165
Because if there's one thing I hate
more than paedophiles...

315
00:24:09,126 --> 00:24:13,125
it's liars.

316
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:18,685
OK. I'll definitely remember that.

317
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:23,125
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

318
00:24:24,886 --> 00:24:28,885
What's the magic word?

319
00:24:29,126 --> 00:24:30,485
Excuse me?

320
00:24:30,486 --> 00:24:34,445
Say the magic word.

321
00:24:34,446 --> 00:24:38,125
Excuse me.

322
00:24:38,126 --> 00:24:42,125
That's two words. Word. Singular.

323
00:24:42,686 --> 00:24:44,205
Try again.

324
00:24:44,206 --> 00:24:47,045
Please?

325
00:24:47,046 --> 00:24:50,765
Please? Please, what?

326
00:24:50,766 --> 00:24:54,765
I...I don't know.

327
00:24:55,686 --> 00:24:59,645
I don't know the magic word.

328
00:24:59,646 --> 00:25:03,645
Were we given a magic word?

329
00:25:06,806 --> 00:25:10,765
The magic word...

330
00:25:10,766 --> 00:25:14,365
is "potato".

331
00:25:14,366 --> 00:25:18,365
Potato.

332
00:25:35,246 --> 00:25:38,325
Hi.

333
00:25:38,326 --> 00:25:39,365
Drink?

334
00:25:39,366 --> 00:25:43,365
Vodka.

335
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:51,845
Ice?

336
00:26:07,686 --> 00:26:09,085
You going to pay for that?

337
00:26:09,086 --> 00:26:13,085
Are you going to make me pay for it?

338
00:26:14,246 --> 00:26:16,605
You sure you're a trainee
probation worker?

339
00:26:16,606 --> 00:26:18,245
Because you don't act like one.

340
00:26:18,246 --> 00:26:22,245
Maybe I only want to be a probation
worker so I can meet bad boys.

341
00:26:24,926 --> 00:26:27,765
Is that right?

342
00:26:27,766 --> 00:26:31,245
Finn.

343
00:26:31,246 --> 00:26:32,485
What're you doing here?

344
00:26:32,486 --> 00:26:34,805
I wanted to talk to
you about yesterday.

345
00:26:34,806 --> 00:26:37,525
Right. OK. Always good to talk.

346
00:26:37,526 --> 00:26:40,565
I didn't mean to freak you out.
I-I know I came on quite strong.

347
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:42,165
You probably think I'm insane.

348
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:44,725
No. You're, you're kooky.
You're definitely kooky.

349
00:26:44,726 --> 00:26:47,965
I don't want you to think of me
as... as your stepmum.

350
00:26:47,966 --> 00:26:50,525
I don't, because you aren't.

351
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:54,525
You and Dad never married.
Never married.

352
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:58,725
Right. So there's... there's no
reason that we can't be together.

353
00:26:58,726 --> 00:27:02,725
Except there is. I'm dying.

354
00:27:03,286 --> 00:27:05,165
No, I'm obviously not dying.

355
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:07,245
I could be.

356
00:27:07,246 --> 00:27:11,245
Finn, I know it's complicated.
I know you have feelings for me

357
00:27:12,286 --> 00:27:15,085
and the last thing that
I want to do is mess it up.

358
00:27:15,086 --> 00:27:19,085
We can... take things slowly.

359
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:23,005
Slow is good. Slow is very good.

360
00:27:23,006 --> 00:27:25,725
Let's slow things right down,
to a crawl.

361
00:27:25,726 --> 00:27:28,725
Why don't you come round tonight?
We can talk...

362
00:27:28,726 --> 00:27:32,725
Tonight? Is... is that slow?
That seems pretty fast.

363
00:27:33,846 --> 00:27:37,845
Do you like me or not?

364
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:44,125
Of course I like you. OK?

365
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:45,365
I like your hair.

366
00:27:45,366 --> 00:27:49,365
So you'll come round tonight?

367
00:27:49,446 --> 00:27:52,565
I'll cook your favourite.

368
00:27:52,566 --> 00:27:56,565
Excellent.

369
00:28:06,606 --> 00:28:09,845
They've been there all night.

370
00:28:09,846 --> 00:28:11,205
I'll leave them to it, then.

371
00:28:11,206 --> 00:28:14,165
Well, do you want a drink?

372
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:16,285
I was going to have one
before we close up.

373
00:28:16,286 --> 00:28:20,285
OK.

374
00:28:25,366 --> 00:28:27,125
What do you think she's thinking?

375
00:28:27,126 --> 00:28:28,285
I think she's thinking,

376
00:28:28,286 --> 00:28:31,205
"Why is Curtis drinking with
a trainee probation worker?"

377
00:28:31,206 --> 00:28:35,205
Maybe she thinks we're fucking.

378
00:28:37,246 --> 00:28:40,525
Would you like people to think that?

379
00:28:40,526 --> 00:28:41,605
I guess it depends.

380
00:28:41,606 --> 00:28:44,245
On what?

381
00:28:44,246 --> 00:28:48,245
Whether we are.

382
00:28:52,246 --> 00:28:54,645
Good night?

383
00:28:54,646 --> 00:28:58,045
It's work, you know.

384
00:28:58,046 --> 00:29:02,045
So, erm... where's that guy
I always see you with in here?

385
00:29:03,966 --> 00:29:06,725
Careful. That sounds like
you're interested in me

386
00:29:06,726 --> 00:29:10,045
and from what I hear,
you're not interested in girls.

387
00:29:10,046 --> 00:29:13,565
You think I'm gay?
Who told you that?

388
00:29:13,566 --> 00:29:14,605
Curtis.

389
00:29:14,606 --> 00:29:17,685
He said you're always knocking back
girls when they come on to you.

390
00:29:17,686 --> 00:29:18,965
And that makes me gay?

391
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,085
I don't know. Does it?

392
00:29:20,086 --> 00:29:24,085
Having sex with men -
that makes you gay.

393
00:29:25,886 --> 00:29:29,885
So if you're not gay, how comes you
knock all these girls back?

394
00:29:30,406 --> 00:29:34,405
Well... if I was really smooth...

395
00:29:37,686 --> 00:29:39,925
then I would look you in the eye

396
00:29:39,926 --> 00:29:43,405
and I would say,

397
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:47,405
"Because they're not you."

398
00:29:50,846 --> 00:29:54,685
I could see a girl going for that.
Not me.

399
00:29:54,686 --> 00:29:57,725
Other girls.

400
00:29:57,726 --> 00:30:01,725
I should close up.

401
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:06,165
D'you want to come back to mine
for a drink?

402
00:30:06,966 --> 00:30:08,045
Forget I asked.

403
00:30:08,046 --> 00:30:12,045
No. It's just, erm...

404
00:30:14,486 --> 00:30:16,845
Sure.

405
00:30:16,846 --> 00:30:20,845
Be right back.

406
00:30:35,246 --> 00:30:37,725
My, er... My neighbour's
just called me.

407
00:30:37,726 --> 00:30:41,725
He said my flat's been broken into.
I have to go.

408
00:30:41,846 --> 00:30:44,765
If you didn't want to come back
to mine, why didn't you just say?

409
00:30:44,766 --> 00:30:46,445
You make up some bullshit story?

410
00:30:46,446 --> 00:30:48,005
It's not like that.
What is it, then?

411
00:30:48,006 --> 00:30:52,005
It's not you.

412
00:31:00,406 --> 00:31:04,405
You scared the shit out of me,
you stupid prick!

413
00:31:04,486 --> 00:31:06,285
What are you doing?

414
00:31:06,286 --> 00:31:07,805
Following you.

415
00:31:07,806 --> 00:31:11,045
You know what? I'm really not
in the mood for your creepy shit!

416
00:31:11,046 --> 00:31:12,805
Bad night?

417
00:31:12,806 --> 00:31:16,805
Do you want to talk about it?

418
00:31:17,846 --> 00:31:21,845
What's your problem?
What do you want from me?

419
00:31:22,606 --> 00:31:25,805
Do you want to fuck me?
You know what?

420
00:31:25,806 --> 00:31:29,405
Get it out of your system. Go ahead!
Come on! Fuck me!

421
00:31:29,406 --> 00:31:33,405
Don't talk like that.
That isn't who you are.

422
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:39,765
You're better than that.

423
00:31:39,766 --> 00:31:42,645
So now you don't want to
have sex with me?

424
00:31:42,646 --> 00:31:46,645
I want to give you something pure
and something honest.

425
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:51,085
I see them cunts, lying to you.

426
00:31:51,086 --> 00:31:53,165
They don't know how special you are.

427
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:57,165
They're not fit to lick
the shit off me own boots.

428
00:32:00,046 --> 00:32:02,925
Me? I'd find the dog that
did that shit

429
00:32:02,926 --> 00:32:06,925
and I'll wring its furry
little neck.

430
00:32:09,846 --> 00:32:12,085
That's quite a speech.

431
00:32:12,086 --> 00:32:16,085
Hmm, I'll never lie to you.

432
00:32:16,646 --> 00:32:20,645
See you tomorrow.

433
00:32:33,006 --> 00:32:36,405
Lisa. Hey! I'm really sorry
I couldn't come round last night.

434
00:32:36,406 --> 00:32:40,405
It's a funny story.
Don't do that.

435
00:32:40,726 --> 00:32:44,485
Lisa! Lisa! Listen, listen to me!
Do not tell me Dad!

436
00:32:44,486 --> 00:32:48,485
Lisa? Lisa?!

437
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:21,165
Dad?

438
00:33:23,966 --> 00:33:27,965
Hi.

439
00:33:28,686 --> 00:33:31,045
I really need to do some exercise.

440
00:33:31,046 --> 00:33:32,725
I just thought I'd swing by.

441
00:33:32,726 --> 00:33:34,685
Why's that?

442
00:33:34,686 --> 00:33:38,685
You know, cos I wanted to let
you know I love you.

443
00:33:38,686 --> 00:33:42,685
I don't say it enough.
I love you, Dad.

444
00:33:42,926 --> 00:33:44,005
Lisa told me.

445
00:33:44,006 --> 00:33:47,925
She's lying. She's a fucking liar!

446
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:49,805
Well, what did she tell you?

447
00:33:49,806 --> 00:33:51,005
She told me what happened.

448
00:33:51,006 --> 00:33:52,525
Oh, did she?

449
00:33:52,526 --> 00:33:56,205
She says she sucked your cock.

450
00:33:56,206 --> 00:33:59,245
What's she like?
What a crazy thing to say!

451
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:01,445
Fuck!

452
00:34:01,446 --> 00:34:04,565
I tried to stop her.
She's on her knees,

453
00:34:04,566 --> 00:34:08,565
ramming my cock in her mouth like
a starving African at a food camp.

454
00:34:08,806 --> 00:34:10,285
It sounds worse than it is.

455
00:34:10,286 --> 00:34:12,205
You f...

456
00:34:12,206 --> 00:34:14,925
How could you do that?
Jesus, Finn!

457
00:34:14,926 --> 00:34:16,405
Dad, I'm sorry.

458
00:34:16,406 --> 00:34:18,405
It's fucking sick!
That's your stepmum.

459
00:34:18,406 --> 00:34:22,005
Is it? You two never married so...

460
00:34:22,006 --> 00:34:23,365
Oh, right!

461
00:34:23,366 --> 00:34:27,365
Dad, I am so sorry.

462
00:34:29,646 --> 00:34:33,645
Look, I'm not your dad.

463
00:34:33,766 --> 00:34:36,565
You think I'm fucking joking?
I'm not your dad.

464
00:34:36,566 --> 00:34:39,245
I took you on.

465
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:41,805
And I raised you, even though
I knew you weren't mine.

466
00:34:41,806 --> 00:34:44,205
You f... You do this to me?

467
00:34:44,206 --> 00:34:48,205
Wh-wh-what are you talking
about? Of course you're me dad.

468
00:34:49,566 --> 00:34:51,645
You have to be. Look at us.

469
00:34:51,646 --> 00:34:54,245
Look how short we are!

470
00:34:54,246 --> 00:34:58,245
You're not mine, Finn.
You never were.

471
00:34:59,926 --> 00:35:02,231
So now you know, you can fuck off.

472
00:35:11,915 --> 00:35:15,914
I am going to tear each
and every one of you a new arsehole.

473
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:19,998
You! You're down for two.

474
00:35:20,049 --> 00:35:22,168
Is there a problem?
Shut it, Snoop Dogg.

475
00:35:22,247 --> 00:35:23,246
Snoop Dogg?

476
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:27,166
Which one of you little fuckers
stole the wedding cake?

477
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:31,166
I think the bride ate it.
I saw her earlier.

478
00:35:33,127 --> 00:35:37,126
She is no stranger
to the dessert trolley.

479
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:46,526
You're on three.

480
00:35:46,527 --> 00:35:50,526
Three arseholes.

481
00:35:53,447 --> 00:35:57,446
My office, one at a time.

482
00:35:58,087 --> 00:36:00,046
We'll start with you,
my little princess.

483
00:36:00,047 --> 00:36:01,566
Why me? I didn't take anything.

484
00:36:03,887 --> 00:36:07,006
"Why, Mama?"

485
00:36:07,007 --> 00:36:11,006
You all just made my list of people
to fuck up today.

486
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:15,086
I guarantee you won't shit
right for a week.

487
00:36:18,967 --> 00:36:20,446
So who took the cake?

488
00:36:20,447 --> 00:36:23,566
Odds are it was a fat person.

489
00:36:23,567 --> 00:36:26,406
Cos they're weak,
and they're craven,

490
00:36:26,407 --> 00:36:30,406
and they fuckin' love cake.

491
00:36:33,727 --> 00:36:36,006
Testing, testing, one, two, three.

492
00:36:49,367 --> 00:36:51,846
Where's the probation worker?

493
00:36:51,847 --> 00:36:55,166
I hate to disappoint you...

494
00:36:55,167 --> 00:36:59,126
but the probation worker
won't be joining us.

495
00:36:59,127 --> 00:37:00,246
How come?

496
00:37:00,247 --> 00:37:04,246
Cos somebody's
locked him in the toilets.

497
00:37:05,407 --> 00:37:08,006
He's not a happy man.

498
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:11,326
Have you thought about what
I said to you?

499
00:37:11,327 --> 00:37:15,326
What's happened to you?

500
00:37:15,847 --> 00:37:16,886
You changed.

501
00:37:16,887 --> 00:37:19,366
I tell you what. I'll show you mine,
if you show me yours.

502
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:22,326
I'm talking secrets,
rather than genitals.

503
00:37:22,327 --> 00:37:24,166
Why should I tell you anything?

504
00:37:24,167 --> 00:37:28,166
What's the point in talking
if it's just more bullshit?

505
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:31,766
OK.

506
00:37:31,767 --> 00:37:33,286
You first.

507
00:37:33,287 --> 00:37:35,686
You're different.
What's going on with you?

508
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:37,006
There's three of me.

509
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:39,606
There's the two you've met already,
and then there's me.

510
00:37:39,607 --> 00:37:41,406
I'm a whole different person.

511
00:37:50,847 --> 00:37:54,286
It's your go.

512
00:37:54,287 --> 00:37:58,286
Someone hurt you, didn't they?

513
00:37:58,727 --> 00:38:00,286
Who was he?

514
00:38:00,287 --> 00:38:03,006
I thought he was my best friend.

515
00:38:03,007 --> 00:38:04,886
Where are they, the other Rudys?

516
00:38:04,887 --> 00:38:08,886
What's the saying?
You, er, keep your friends close...

517
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,606
and your enemies closer.

518
00:38:14,607 --> 00:38:15,806
They're your enemies?

519
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:25,286
Now it's my turn.

520
00:38:25,287 --> 00:38:29,166
This bloke. What did he do?

521
00:38:29,167 --> 00:38:33,166
I used to have an eating disorder.

522
00:38:34,767 --> 00:38:38,766
I wasn't, I wasn't very happy.

523
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:40,526
Danny was there for me.

524
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:44,086
He was the only person
I could talk to.

525
00:38:44,087 --> 00:38:47,526
I told him stuff.

526
00:38:47,527 --> 00:38:49,326
Things I've never told anyone else.

527
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,126
We started sleeping together.

528
00:38:52,127 --> 00:38:54,446
Just like that,
he stopped calling me.

529
00:38:54,447 --> 00:38:57,486
He moved on to some other
messed-up girl. He befriended her.

530
00:38:57,487 --> 00:39:01,486
And then he fucked her.

531
00:39:05,007 --> 00:39:09,006
I took some pills and washed them
down with a bottle of vodka.

532
00:39:10,087 --> 00:39:14,086
I guess I wanted to die.

533
00:39:15,007 --> 00:39:17,006
Everything he has ever said to me
was a lie.

534
00:39:24,167 --> 00:39:25,286
Where were you before?

535
00:39:25,287 --> 00:39:27,886
I was in prison.

536
00:39:27,887 --> 00:39:31,886
The two other Rudys betrayed me,
set me up.

537
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:39,206
Betrayed by the two people
I was closest to.

538
00:39:40,087 --> 00:39:44,086
Have you been with anyone else
since him?

539
00:39:44,487 --> 00:39:48,486
I haven't even kissed a guy
in over three years.

540
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:54,086
Why were you in prison?

541
00:39:54,087 --> 00:39:55,486
I enjoy hurting people.

542
00:41:34,407 --> 00:41:38,406
What do you want from me?

543
00:41:38,727 --> 00:41:41,566
All my life, I've wanted to know
what it would feel like

544
00:41:41,567 --> 00:41:44,486
to kill someone.

545
00:41:44,487 --> 00:41:48,486
From the moment I saw you,
I knew you were the one.

546
00:41:49,847 --> 00:41:52,126
I want to know what it feels like,

547
00:41:52,127 --> 00:41:54,846
to slowly squeeze the life
out of your body.

548
00:41:54,847 --> 00:41:58,566
I want to feel you go limp
in my hands.

549
00:41:58,567 --> 00:42:02,566
I want to share this with you.

550
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:06,326
Don't struggle. Ssshhh.

551
00:42:06,327 --> 00:42:10,326
You're so beautiful.

552
00:42:28,887 --> 00:42:30,446
You lied to me.

553
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:32,726
Let the other Rudys go.

554
00:42:32,727 --> 00:42:34,686
It's over. Let them go.

555
00:42:34,687 --> 00:42:35,686
Kiss me.

556
00:42:35,687 --> 00:42:36,846
Let them go.

557
00:42:36,847 --> 00:42:40,566
Kiss me.

558
00:42:59,527 --> 00:43:02,966
That wasn't so bad, was it?

559
00:43:02,967 --> 00:43:05,286
You get out there now.

560
00:43:05,287 --> 00:43:09,286
Get yourself some cock.

561
00:43:09,807 --> 00:43:11,166
Promise me.

562
00:43:11,167 --> 00:43:12,366
I promise.

563
00:43:12,367 --> 00:43:15,086
Yeah.

564
00:43:15,087 --> 00:43:19,086
Let them go. Please. For me.

565
00:43:28,727 --> 00:43:32,246
What does it feel like?

566
00:43:32,247 --> 00:43:34,766
To kill someone?

567
00:43:34,767 --> 00:43:35,926
It's horrible.

568
00:43:35,927 --> 00:43:39,926
Seriously?

569
00:43:40,767 --> 00:43:44,766
Where's the fun in that?

570
00:43:58,767 --> 00:44:02,766
I'll get the shovels.

571
00:44:18,487 --> 00:44:19,846
Your dad isn't your dad?

572
00:44:19,847 --> 00:44:23,326
So wait, who is your dad?

573
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,326
Turns out me mum
was a bit of a slut.

574
00:44:25,327 --> 00:44:26,526
No.

575
00:44:26,527 --> 00:44:27,926
Quite a lot of a slut.

576
00:44:27,927 --> 00:44:31,926
A huge, gigantic... Oh,
I'm trying not to think about it.

577
00:44:33,367 --> 00:44:37,086
No, it just could be anyone.
Could be me, could be him.

578
00:44:37,087 --> 00:44:39,326
Except you would have needed
to travel back in time.

579
00:44:39,327 --> 00:44:42,566
It was him.
He had the power to rewind time.

580
00:44:42,567 --> 00:44:45,246
I didn't travel through time
to fuck his mum.

581
00:44:45,247 --> 00:44:47,846
Yeah, well, I'm gonna side with him,
because of the whole...

582
00:44:47,847 --> 00:44:51,846
skin tone thing.
So, going over here.

583
00:44:57,927 --> 00:45:01,086
I'm sorry.

584
00:45:01,087 --> 00:45:05,086
The whole Lisa thing.
I'm a fucking idiot.

585
00:45:06,847 --> 00:45:09,606
Are we...

586
00:45:09,607 --> 00:45:12,486
Are we OK?

587
00:45:12,487 --> 00:45:15,886
You are a fucking idiot
and a total prick...

588
00:45:15,887 --> 00:45:19,886
just a really big, purple bell-end.

589
00:45:23,007 --> 00:45:25,846
We're fine.

590
00:45:25,847 --> 00:45:27,766
So if you're not doing
anything later,

591
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:31,766
d'you want to not go home
and watch a DVD with me?

592
00:45:33,767 --> 00:45:37,766
Some other time. Stabbing someone
to death with a pair of scissors.

593
00:45:39,327 --> 00:45:43,326
Not really a popcorn moment.

594
00:45:56,967 --> 00:46:00,966
I got you a present.

595
00:46:08,407 --> 00:46:12,406
So you are a bad boy after all.

596
00:46:18,847 --> 00:46:22,846
That is fucking nice cake.

597
00:46:28,487 --> 00:46:31,246
What needs to be done...
needs to be done.

598
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:33,366
You're going to bring him
back to life, aren't you?

599
00:46:33,367 --> 00:46:34,526
You used me.

600
00:46:34,527 --> 00:46:36,566
He says he's going to kill me.

601
00:46:36,567 --> 00:46:38,006
I think Curtis is in trouble.

602
00:46:38,007 --> 00:46:39,966
I'm not going to let that happen.

603
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:41,646
He attacked me.

604
00:46:41,647 --> 00:46:43,686
Have you got any jelly?

605
00:46:43,687 --> 00:46:44,926
What do you need jelly for?

606
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:47,526
I would've thought that was pretty
friggin' obvious. Check that out.

607
00:46:47,527 --> 00:46:49,726
Where are you,
you little shit? Come on!

608
00:46:49,727 --> 00:46:52,006
Some things were just not
meant to be.

609
00:46:52,007 --> 00:46:54,326
Are you sure we can't...

610
00:46:54,327 --> 00:46:58,326
manufacture some sort of
a happy ending?

611
00:46:58,351 --> 00:47:22,155
