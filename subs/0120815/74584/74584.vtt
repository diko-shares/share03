00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,499
Hey! the beer!

2
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Yes, sweety...

3
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,050
Take a beer.

4
00:03:19,917 --> 00:03:21,635
Who wants more champagne?!

5
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,630
Are you crazy or what?!

6
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:26,834
Bruce!

7
00:03:26,835 --> 00:03:28,460
Steve... so sorry man...

8
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:29,921
I'm sorry...

9
00:03:29,922 --> 00:03:31,043
What did we say?

10
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,502
Friends only, just relax...

11
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,751
and...

12
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,209
don't break anything!

13
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,334
I'm serious, Bruce...

14
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,502
this place's gonna look like
no one have been here.

15
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:42,749
Don't worry..., when we're clone.

16
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,879
I'll set it personally
and everything is in its place.

17
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,375
Do you want a drink?

18
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:51,381
Come on man... relax, have a drink!

19
00:03:51,382 --> 00:03:52,749
What's up sis!

20
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,299
Ohh! there's your funny
face of yours again...

21
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,878
What happened in England?
How's school?

22
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:02,335
It's just awful..., and you bloody jerk,
will you stop calling me sis?

23
00:04:02,336 --> 00:04:04,006
You know I don't like it.

24
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:06,885
And what about your friends?

25
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,082
Really weird...

26
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,629
She is a friend of Nick...,
one of his blind dates.

27
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,469
To me, she looks like the killer
from "Friday 13th".

28
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:16,842
Relax, have a good time.

29
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,416
With your friends?

30
00:04:19,417 --> 00:04:20,509
No, thanks.

31
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:25,711
Ok then... When we get back you
complain to dad..., stop being a snore.

32
00:04:25,712 --> 00:04:28,835
With your attitude you're gonna end up
old, alone and bitter.

33
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:32,713
I will do if you keep on at me
all the time! Just leave me alone!

34
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,219
Come on... Try to socialize a bit more.

35
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,083
Well...

36
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,174
maybe I have noticed somebody
interesting in your party.

37
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:42,926
It's a pretty bad taste, sis.

38
00:04:42,927 --> 00:04:44,715
Look who's talking, bro.

39
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:48,257
Emma is a little weird, don't you think?

40
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,751
HEY, are you ok?

41
00:04:51,752 --> 00:04:53,673
Yes... I just get a little seasick,
I'm fine.

42
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,922
Speaking of weirdos...

43
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:02,128
Come on Samantha, be nice...
After all she's my sister in law.

44
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:04,048
All my condolences, sweet heart.

45
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:08,012
I'm pretty sure she's a spoiled
little brad.

46
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,250
Right?

47
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:15,046
Well..., at least Bruce isn't like that.

48
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:19,344
I wouldn't really trust him around here.

49
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:24,087
Are you sure you're ok? Seriously,
you're really starting to freak me out.

50
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:27,419
Michelle, I have to tell you something..

51
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,295
Come on girls!, what are you doing here?!

52
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:34,092
Come to the party! We're gonna a
christen the boat! Come on!

53
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:35,801
Let's christen the boat!

54
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,506
I told you this was a great plan.

55
00:05:57,042 --> 00:05:59,295
Look, the best part is still to come,

56
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,502
you can't hear a soul.

57
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,127
Helloooo!

58
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,215
Hey!..., listen...

59
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:12,506
we're going inside, Ok?
We will back in a minute...

60
00:06:12,507 --> 00:06:16,050
Ok..., but don't forget: if you fuck up
anything of my dad's, we're fired...

61
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:17,964
after he cuts your balls off,
of course.

62
00:06:17,965 --> 00:06:19,335
Don't worry...

63
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:22,636
I wouldn't do anything to annoy the
brain boss, you know me.

64
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:23,833
Ciao, mate.

65
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,085
Hey, Michelle...

66
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:33,465
just a moment, sir...
Come here!

67
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:53,169
We have to stop the bleeding!

68
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:56,511
Are you alright, man? Oh, man!

69
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:59,136
I didn't mean to, Steve...
Are you alright, man?

70
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:02,345
Oh my god!..., Steve, I didn't mean
to do that, man!

71
00:07:02,346 --> 00:07:03,374
I'm so sorry...

72
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,416
Shut up jerk! Bring the first-aid kit!

73
00:07:05,417 --> 00:07:07,966
Someone get the first-aid kit!
Nick, go and get the first-aid kit!

74
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:10,006
Cover it!..., it's really deep...

75
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:10,709
Shut up!

76
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,374
Is still glass in there?

77
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:15,458
Easy with the foot..., easy, easy...
It's really deep!

78
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,752
Are you guys stupid?!
Who the hell emptied the first-aid kit?!

79
00:07:18,753 --> 00:07:21,671
I though we should stock out
in case we run out...

80
00:07:21,672 --> 00:07:23,965
Run out?! The only possibility
to run... Fuck you!

81
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:26,044
I'm sorry!, It wasn't on purpose...

82
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,294
Oh, man...

83
00:07:28,295 --> 00:07:31,136
All right! everybody stay calm, I'm
gonna take the boat back to the port...

84
00:07:31,137 --> 00:07:33,791
No, no!..., you're not gonna take
the boat back to the port.

85
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:36,136
We've got three hours to reach the port,
he's losing a lot of blood...

86
00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:38,476
it's better if they just sew him up
in this town..., come on, let's go!

87
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,500
Go, let's go!

88
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,130
Easy, easy...

89
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,209
Don't worry too much about it, you know...
my brother gets a little bit mad...

90
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,835
he'll soon get over it.

91
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,130
He'll get over it.

92
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:21,876
Come on, we find to find a doctor,
a first-aid kit..., anything.

93
00:09:21,877 --> 00:09:22,877
Guys!

94
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,835
Guys!, that curtain just closed.

95
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,209
There's somebody there.

96
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,334
Go check it...

97
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:29,583
Come on!

98
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,125
Hello?!

99
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,173
Is anybody there?
Hello?!

100
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:41,919
Please, we need help!

101
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,545
This place gives me the creeps.

102
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,544
I wouldn't mind living here...

103
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,176
except with more people, of course.

104
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,176
Hey, kid! Come here!

105
00:09:58,042 --> 00:10:00,340
Congratulations Bruce! Really...

106
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,385
don't you get tired of fucking up
so much?!

107
00:10:16,292 --> 00:10:17,292
Jesus!

108
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:23,957
Hey shrimp, come here...

109
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,255
I'm not gonna a hurt you.

110
00:10:25,256 --> 00:10:26,672
I know that.

111
00:10:27,042 --> 00:10:30,124
Look..., one of my friends is hurt
and he needs help.

112
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,957
You can't stay here...,
you must leave.

113
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,677
Don't worry, as soon as we heal
my friends wounds we'll leave, ok?

114
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:38,170
I'm not allowed to talk to strangers.

115
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,672
Fine then, look..., I'm Nick.

116
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,457
Nice to meet you, ok?
Now you know me...

117
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,298
so now you can tell me
where the doctor is, ok?

118
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,593
Hello!, is anyone there?!

119
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:03,583
Bruce!

120
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,125
What happened?

121
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:11,658
Don't ask, mate..., don't ask.

122
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,208
Look!

123
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,333
Hello?

124
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:23,293
Anybody here?
Hello?

125
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:28,293
Is anybody there?

126
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:30,708
Hello...

127
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Hello?

128
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,423
Ok, take everything we might need...

129
00:11:42,424 --> 00:11:45,261
bandages, hydrogen peroxide,
alcohol...

130
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:47,714
We have plenty of that.

131
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,923
What the hell Bruce!,
stop being an ass...

132
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,083
Shit!

133
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,398
Don't worry, don't worry..., look...

134
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,171
we're not here to rob,
we are just looking for some help, ok?

135
00:12:05,172 --> 00:12:07,419
Our friend is injured and
he needs a doctor... Relax...

136
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,919
Come on guys, let's get out of here.

137
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,125
Come on...

138
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,583
Take it easy...

139
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:18,922
Relax..
Calm down...

140
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,083
Let's get out of here.

141
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:26,917
Let's go!

142
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,464
What's wrong with you?

143
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,547
Open the door!

144
00:12:35,792 --> 00:12:36,792
Nut case!

145
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:40,207
We're just trying to ask for help
and he's got a freaking harpoon!

146
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:40,879
Sophie!

147
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,923
Does this look like
the right time for photos?

148
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,582
Because you say so?

149
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,959
Sophie, cut it out...

150
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,378
don't act like a ten-year-old.

151
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:51,879
Sophie, put the camera away and
go look for help, please!

152
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,174
That's a brilliant idea...
Are you all crazy or what?!

153
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:57,920
Ask for help in this crazy old town?!

154
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,005
Whatever!

155
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:04,090
We have to keep looking...
It's an Olympus, no?

156
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:06,010
It's a really good camera.

157
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:09,833
Easy, easy...

158
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,334
Guys!

159
00:13:12,335 --> 00:13:14,051
We need to split up..., guys!

160
00:13:14,052 --> 00:13:18,627
Bruce..., I'll take him...
you... take Sophie with you.

161
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,507
Do that again sweetheart and
I'll make you eat that camera.

162
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,001
Sophie, come on!

163
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,125
Hurry!

164
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:33,755
Sophie, come on!

165
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,332
You've slept with her, don't you?

166
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,333
What?!

167
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:47,550
Who?

168
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:51,758
Sophie..., come on Bruce,
she melts every time you look at her.

169
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,541
But she's a friend.

170
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:54,624
A friend!?

171
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,798
Bruce, you've seen her twice your life.

172
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:57,999
She's just a kid!

173
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,469
She seems pretty grown up to me.

174
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:01,541
Samantha...

175
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:02,132
What?

176
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,423
You're getting like this again,
you always get like this.

177
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:06,625
Like what?

178
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:08,417
You know what?

179
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,374
Now that you mention it,

180
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,375
she's not bad.

181
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:17,919
It was a joke Samantha...

182
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:20,885
What the hell are we doing?

183
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:24,174
Wouldn't it be better if we just go
back to the boat and get out of here?

184
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:28,751
Why don't you tell that to your boyfriend,
the new Indiana Jones?

185
00:14:28,752 --> 00:14:31,048
I've seen a house on the hill
from the boat.

186
00:14:31,542 --> 00:14:34,169
Well, ok Indy, show us where
that house is,

187
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,918
because all I can see here...

188
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:38,716
are three lost idiots
in the middle of nowhere.

189
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:45,917
Steve!

190
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,459
I would've taken the boat and
we'd be halfway home by now.

191
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:53,842
My brother is a real...

192
00:14:53,843 --> 00:14:55,960
Hey!, be careful what you say
about your brother,

193
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,171
he's a good guy,...

194
00:14:57,172 --> 00:14:59,631
He did this whole thing for Michelle.

195
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,964
Yeah, that fat cow..., but you know what?

196
00:15:01,965 --> 00:15:04,460
I bet they won't even last more
than six months,

197
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:07,129
and I bet that's more than you
and your blind date.

198
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,464
Do we have to put up
with this little star?

199
00:15:09,465 --> 00:15:12,332
I'm sure if we No her alive
nobody will notice.

200
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,334
Just forget about her.

201
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:20,175
You know...

202
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,628
if this trip was meant to
cheer up Michelle,

203
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:24,874
we're doing a pretty crappy job-

204
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,082
You mean you're doing a great job of it,

205
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,256
first of all, you fuck Steve's foot,
and know you wanna fuck his sister?

206
00:15:29,257 --> 00:15:30,624
Sam: You're a spaz!

207
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,627
Oh yeah!, I'm the paranoid one...

208
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:35,716
Don't you ever think about
looking her again.

209
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,500
Not a peep!

210
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:41,634
Scout's honor!

211
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,630
I'm not kidding, Bruce.

212
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:48,885
I'm really serious.

213
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,251
You're incredible!

214
00:15:51,252 --> 00:15:52,593
Sam, when you get like this,

215
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:56,052
you know..., it's best to just ignore you.

216
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,545
Samantha...

217
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,794
I just feel really weird,

218
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:12,920
as if someone is watching us.

219
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:19,124
What's wrong with Michelle?

220
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,207
Hasn't your boyfriend told you?

221
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,209
No..., I should have asked
your dying brother..

222
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,381
Ok Sophie, that's enough...
and you too, Emma.

223
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,959
This is really bad timing, come on.

224
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,624
Are you gonna tell why we organize
this social rave?

225
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,625
Sophie...!

226
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:34,958
God!

227
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,551
It's none of your business Sophie.

228
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,293
Look, Michelle...

229
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,128
Michelle was just feeling depressed,

230
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,378
and Steve just wanted to do something
nice to cheer her up, ok?

231
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:49,592
That's all!

232
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,551
You not hear that?

233
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,717
What?

234
00:17:14,718 --> 00:17:16,085
Is the baby scared?

235
00:17:16,292 --> 00:17:18,841
Stop being a jerk, it's not your style.

236
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,217
Just joking.

237
00:17:20,218 --> 00:17:22,210
Apparently it's not time for jokes.

238
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,175
Where're you going?

239
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:33,880
Are you from the town?

240
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:39,590
You can't make any noise.

241
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:47,169
Ok, look...,
we're not gonna make any noise,

242
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:50,669
but tell us where the doctor is, ok?...,
just those guys with white lab coats...

243
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,793
Nick, leave it...

244
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,791
Look, my brother is really hurt...

245
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:56,339
and he needs help.

246
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:58,499
He doesn't need help anymore,

247
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,500
you do.

248
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,756
Excuse me, what did you say?

249
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:04,669
You shouldn't left him alone.

250
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,547
He isn't alone.

251
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,089
What are you laughing at?

252
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,177
Laughter isn't very common
around here, and you'll se.

253
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,754
Great, she's off her rockers...
another one off her rockers.

254
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,882
Well, just leave it...,
let's go and find this house, right?

255
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,172
Where're you going?

256
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:25,880
Where're you going?

257
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,666
Wherever you do,

258
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:32,544
don't make noise.

259
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,336
She is totally bizarre.

260
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,005
Michelle, where are you going?

261
00:19:06,006 --> 00:19:08,207
Hold on, I think I see someone..

262
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,461
Michelle... don't leave me here!

263
00:19:12,042 --> 00:19:13,042
Michelle!

264
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:15,214
Wait 'till the rest show up!

265
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:19,917
Hello?

266
00:19:26,292 --> 00:19:27,292
Hello?

267
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:32,542
Spaz?!

268
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:38,709
Come on Samantha...

269
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,085
we are here for Michelle.

270
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:50,667
What is it?

271
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,710
Samantha... what's wrong?

272
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,333
What's wrong?!

273
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,093
He is already here...

274
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:14,009
don't make a sound..., don't you move...,
and don't you even breath.

275
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,131
He knows you're here.

276
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,751
Oh, no...!

277
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:33,922
Steve!

278
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:37,167
Steve!

279
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,377
Steve!

280
00:20:41,167 --> 00:20:43,920
Steve! Steveee!

281
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:54,919
Steveee!

282
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:03,792
Samantha...

283
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:05,958
what is it?

284
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,127
Steveee!

285
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,218
Come on.. come on... come on!

286
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,125
Michelle!

287
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,300
What's wrong?!

288
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,676
Where's Steve?

289
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:26,376
They've taken him.

290
00:21:26,377 --> 00:21:27,707
Who?! What!

291
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,051
Who's taken him?, Michelle look at me...

292
00:21:29,052 --> 00:21:30,168
Weren't you together?

293
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:34,052
Who's taken him?
Who's taken him?

294
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,291
Michelle... Michelle...

295
00:21:37,292 --> 00:21:38,214
Where's he?

296
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:39,551
Michelle, is he in that house?

297
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,500
Where?

298
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:46,259
Open the door...

299
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,334
Michelle...

300
00:21:47,335 --> 00:21:49,131
Who are you?, Open the door!

301
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:52,416
Open the fucking door!

302
00:21:52,417 --> 00:21:53,919
Is he in there?

303
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,375
Steve!

304
00:21:57,792 --> 00:21:58,792
Steve...

305
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,125
Jesus!

306
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:04,794
How dare you shout in my house!?

307
00:22:04,795 --> 00:22:06,635
Do you want get us all killed?

308
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:08,843
I saved your life, honey...

309
00:22:09,292 --> 00:22:13,420
Now you just leave this town and get out
of here, while you still can..

310
00:22:13,421 --> 00:22:16,169
Could you please tell us what's
going on? Where's Steve?

311
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,794
Try the house on the hill...

312
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:22,047
Now just leave here and leave us alone...
Please!

313
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,500
Ok.

314
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:30,666
I'll go crazy.

315
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:32,044
We have to get the boat and get help.

316
00:22:32,045 --> 00:22:34,044
No, we have to find Steve, please...

317
00:22:34,045 --> 00:22:36,261
He has the keys of the boat!

318
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:38,667
Michelle...

319
00:22:39,917 --> 00:22:41,669
I'm gonna go and look for Steve.

320
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:43,833
Samantha...

321
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,250
Let's go...

322
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,459
We have to go.

323
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:47,917
Come on...

324
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,375
Bruce!

325
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,922
Oh my god...

326
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:04,669
check this place out.

327
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,050
There's no one inside.

328
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:32,044
God, it stinks.

329
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,083
Hello...?

330
00:23:49,417 --> 00:23:50,464
Who's there?

331
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:09,583
Hello?!

332
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:11,458
Hello!

333
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Hello!

334
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,547
Is anybody here?

335
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:16,249
Sophieee!

336
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,250
Steve?

337
00:24:17,292 --> 00:24:20,091
Sophie! I'm here!

338
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,832
Where are you?

339
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,335
Steve? Steve!

340
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:25,916
Sophie, please!

341
00:24:25,917 --> 00:24:27,544
Sophieee!

342
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:29,130
Sophie!

343
00:24:30,542 --> 00:24:32,255
We've got to find the way to get in.

344
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,469
But we don't know what's
waiting for us inside...

345
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:37,052
Emma! my brother is in that house!

346
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,127
Sophieee!

347
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:43,504
Well, fine, just get out of here!
I'm going in.

348
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:45,255
I don't like the look of this...

349
00:24:45,256 --> 00:24:47,627
I'm gonna go back down
to the village and get some help.

350
00:24:47,628 --> 00:24:50,378
But we can't leave Steve here.
That was him!

351
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:52,958
Fuck!

352
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:56,542
Steve!

353
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,797
Get out of here!

354
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:06,002
Open the door!

355
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:13,335
Shit!, there's no way to get in...

356
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,627
Help!

357
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:04,755
Help!

358
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:08,172
Who are you?

359
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:14,335
Who are you?

360
00:26:14,792 --> 00:26:16,419
What do you want?

361
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:22,713
My brother... where is my brother?!

362
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:29,714
Steve!

363
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,503
I can't take anymore...

364
00:26:36,042 --> 00:26:37,669
you have to escape.

365
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:39,881
Who've done this to you?

366
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,923
Get out of here.

367
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:45,004
Don't worry, I'll get you out of here.

368
00:26:48,958 --> 00:26:52,132
But... don't make any noise.

369
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:16,002
Don't be afraid.

370
00:28:18,542 --> 00:28:19,794
I'm your friend.

371
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:22,134
Are you lost?

372
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,249
Can I help you?

373
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,378
What's going on?,
you said that my friend...

374
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,335
You smell good.

375
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:34,167
Listen...

376
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:37,551
you're all in danger...

377
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,416
you can't make noise, not a sound...

378
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:47,093
he doesn't like strangers,
and he doesn't like noise.

379
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:50,084
Where are your friends?

380
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:54,252
They're up at the house on the hill,
they wanted to go inside.

381
00:28:54,253 --> 00:28:56,796
They can't go inside,
nobody can't go inside there.

382
00:28:56,797 --> 00:28:58,510
Why does anybody want to help us?

383
00:28:58,511 --> 00:29:00,749
Because everybody is afraid...

384
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,923
except of me...
I can help you.

385
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:05,005
Believe me...

386
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:08,803
the only person you can trust
around here is good old Doe.

387
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:14,710
This doesn't look like
the house of a killer.

388
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:34,426
Look at this view!

389
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:36,464
All right...

390
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:41,176
And dinner is served!

391
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:44,052
Excellent! I guess if no one is here...

392
00:30:45,292 --> 00:30:47,841
Have yourselves,
do you want some carpaccio?

393
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:49,426
How can you think of food now?

394
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:51,755
You're incredible Bruce.

395
00:30:51,756 --> 00:30:53,297
Do you want some?
No!

396
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:55,131
This place gives me the creeps...

397
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,252
everything is just so weird...

398
00:30:58,083 --> 00:31:00,707
They've got all this classic food...

399
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:04,042
and the pool... is totally nasty.

400
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:13,252
What?
The boat!

401
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,291
So we've got dinner...

402
00:31:18,292 --> 00:31:19,885
and we just need drinks.

403
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:25,457
A red wine...
would go perfect with this carpaccio.

404
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:27,753
Are you even listening to yourself, Bruce?

405
00:31:27,754 --> 00:31:29,798
Can you really be so insensitive?

406
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:32,927
I remind you that we are here
because of you...

407
00:31:33,542 --> 00:31:36,625
and you're talking about
a freaking carpaccio?!

408
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:39,586
It's your fault, Bruce... your fault!

409
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,416
I..., I would...

410
00:31:43,417 --> 00:31:45,832
I? I what, Bruce...
I what?!

411
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:47,959
I was the funny guy,
I was the guy messing everything up!

412
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,752
Cut it out Michelle!

413
00:31:48,753 --> 00:31:49,753
Shut up Sam!

414
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:52,085
Do you care what happen to Steve?

415
00:31:52,086 --> 00:31:53,249
Of course I do.

416
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:56,709
Then stop... fucking up!

417
00:32:46,917 --> 00:32:49,796
Only you can save us.

418
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:53,130
What do you want?

419
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:56,257
To die in peace...

420
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:59,927
he will kill all of you.

421
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,500
Who?

422
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:08,802
What? What!?

423
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,593
You're dreaming...

424
00:33:37,708 --> 00:33:39,676
and it will not be a good sleep.

425
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:43,256
And what happened to these
people wasn't either.

426
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:46,669
For a while, it was all quiet...

427
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:51,842
but one horrible day people began
to disappear mysteriously.

428
00:33:56,542 --> 00:33:58,590
One after an another...

429
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:02,796
everyone involved in their death
were brutally murdered.

430
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,218
We all knew who was to blame...

431
00:34:10,542 --> 00:34:13,921
but until we saw his empty grave
we could not believe it.

432
00:34:14,542 --> 00:34:16,670
The evil man had returned.

433
00:34:18,292 --> 00:34:20,715
We started raiding the woods
to hunt him...

434
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:23,710
but our rage turned into prayer.

435
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:26,926
We tried to hide in our village...

436
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:28,835
anywhere possible...

437
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,672
but it was useless.

438
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,424
At the end,
we took refugee in our homes...

439
00:34:50,917 --> 00:34:52,965
and in the most absolute silence...

440
00:34:54,208 --> 00:34:56,051
but we still kept dying.

441
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:12,676
Now there're only a few of us,

442
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:14,880
and we're hungry...

443
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:17,676
so you will be our dinner.

444
00:36:51,917 --> 00:36:53,419
I like this boy,

445
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:55,255
I want to save him,

446
00:36:56,417 --> 00:36:58,090
can he be my friend?

447
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:01,086
You can't save anyone,

448
00:37:01,792 --> 00:37:03,169
you know the rules.

449
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:05,505
What a pity...

450
00:37:06,167 --> 00:37:07,544
he looks so nice...

451
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:10,711
He's gonna kill them all.

452
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:13,260
Then I'll tell him...

453
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,672
the next one...

454
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:20,215
is gonna be you.

455
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,968
OK... Ok.

456
00:38:09,125 --> 00:38:10,798
You cannot be my friend...

457
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:13,294
now it's too late.

458
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,710
What do you mean it's too late?

459
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:17,464
Help me get out of here.

460
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:18,750
Then...

461
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:20,209
I die.

462
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:22,427
Are you just gonna a leave me
here like this?

463
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:24,051
You're already dead.

464
00:38:24,583 --> 00:38:28,087
All those who make noise
cannot be my friend.

465
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:30,130
He's coming now.

466
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:41,300
Who do you live with?

467
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:44,589
With my father.

468
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:47,333
And your mother?

469
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:49,667
Dead.

470
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:52,083
Oh god...

471
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:54,168
I'm sorry.

472
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:56,877
My mother died too,

473
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:58,713
in a car accident...

474
00:38:58,714 --> 00:39:00,585
it was dark and she was
driving home late...

475
00:39:00,586 --> 00:39:02,130
Mine hanged herself.

476
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:10,426
Do you have any brothers or sisters?

477
00:39:11,625 --> 00:39:12,877
A baby sister.

478
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
So cute!

479
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:18,843
She's dead too.

480
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:24,801
Michelle, I'm really sorry... I mean...

481
00:39:26,542 --> 00:39:27,919
of course..., I didn't...

482
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:30,127
hurt Steve on purpose, you know.

483
00:39:31,042 --> 00:39:32,919
The bottle broke, he step on the glass...

484
00:39:34,417 --> 00:39:35,794
Accidents happen.

485
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,170
You know what I've realized, Bruce?

486
00:39:40,542 --> 00:39:42,965
That under that pretty face of yours,

487
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:45,211
you are a bad person.

488
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:49,258
You're a selfish and bad person.

489
00:39:50,542 --> 00:39:51,542
Michelle...

490
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:54,585
Michelle, you can't mean that...

491
00:39:55,417 --> 00:39:56,755
Steve was my best friend.

492
00:39:56,756 --> 00:40:00,505
Was? What do you mean was?
Steve is alive, Ok... he's alive!

493
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:10,842
What the fuck!

494
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:13,333
I've seen her...
Sam!

495
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:14,334
What?

496
00:40:14,335 --> 00:40:15,749
We can't stay here.

497
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,798
Without Steve? No, Sam!, No!

498
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:20,043
Michelle listen to me, ok?

499
00:40:20,044 --> 00:40:23,041
I've seen a little girl...
in the bathroom...

500
00:40:23,042 --> 00:40:24,760
(Sam, what's wrong)
What are you talking about?

501
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:26,999
I've seen her twice already!
We have to get out.

502
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,469
There's someone else here?
Yes! There's someone else here, Bruce!

503
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,506
I'm not going anywhere without Steve.

504
00:40:31,507 --> 00:40:33,594
Michelle, we have to get out...

505
00:40:34,042 --> 00:40:37,091
No matter what, we need to get
the fuck out of here, ok?

506
00:40:37,092 --> 00:40:38,291
What little girl?

507
00:40:38,292 --> 00:40:40,881
A little girl!
What little girl, Sam?!

508
00:40:40,882 --> 00:40:42,377
What did she tell you, Samantha?

509
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:45,175
That girl.

510
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:50,708
Oh my god...

511
00:40:51,542 --> 00:40:53,761
can stupidity be contagious, Bruce?

512
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,252
Thanks a lot, Sam.

513
00:40:58,958 --> 00:40:59,880
I swear.

514
00:40:59,881 --> 00:41:01,343
What did she tell you?

515
00:41:01,344 --> 00:41:02,999
Ok! look, look...

516
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,501
This is what we're gonna do, ok?

517
00:41:04,502 --> 00:41:08,209
We're gonna search the house,
and if Steve isn't here we'll go, ok?

518
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:10,927
I promise, but I need you now Sam...
Please...

519
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,626
Put yourself together...

520
00:41:12,627 --> 00:41:14,002
Ok...
Yeah?

521
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:26,214
How do you do it?

522
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,218
Your feet don't make a sound.

523
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:32,218
My father liked silence.

524
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:35,927
If we made any noise he would hurt us.

525
00:41:36,417 --> 00:41:37,919
How do you manage with that?

526
00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:40,169
Why it's so difficult?

527
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:46,958
Doe?

528
00:41:49,833 --> 00:41:50,833
Doe!

529
00:41:55,458 --> 00:41:56,458
Doe...

530
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:14,175
Doe...

531
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:19,709
Doe...

532
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:22,875
Yes?!

533
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,548
We learnt not to make a peep.

534
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:30,083
Come on...

535
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:33,085
we are very close now.

536
00:42:46,167 --> 00:42:47,167
Nothing here.

537
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:13,712
You have broken his silence.

538
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,424
He wants one of you.

539
00:43:23,292 --> 00:43:24,589
Come closer...

540
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:27,377
closer...

541
00:43:27,917 --> 00:43:29,840
closer to me.

542
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:43,925
Trust me... Together we can beat him.

543
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:51,086
She can save us.

544
00:43:52,708 --> 00:43:54,210
Who are you talking about?

545
00:43:55,625 --> 00:43:58,094
You'll never want to give him...

546
00:44:02,708 --> 00:44:06,133
something you're carrying inside.

547
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:27,958
Sam...

548
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:29,917
What's wrong?

549
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:31,750
Samantha...

550
00:44:32,375 --> 00:44:33,791
I've talked to her.

551
00:44:33,792 --> 00:44:34,918
What? Who?

552
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:36,550
The little girl.

553
00:44:37,333 --> 00:44:38,710
What little girl?
I've talked to her.

554
00:44:38,711 --> 00:44:41,547
Sam, ok..., I know you're scared,
it's normal to see...

555
00:44:41,548 --> 00:44:44,011
Bruce, I'm not losing my mind!
Listen to me, ok?

556
00:44:44,792 --> 00:44:47,011
She told me things that
you don't even know.

557
00:44:47,458 --> 00:44:48,458
Ok?

558
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:50,425
What?

559
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:51,709
What dis she tell you?

560
00:44:55,042 --> 00:44:56,544
I'm pregnant.

561
00:45:02,792 --> 00:45:03,918
Christ...

562
00:45:05,292 --> 00:45:07,294
that little girl has some timing.

563
00:45:07,542 --> 00:45:08,542
Come here.

564
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,797
Samantha...

565
00:45:14,708 --> 00:45:16,130
That's... wow!

566
00:45:29,583 --> 00:45:30,583
Michelle...

567
00:45:31,292 --> 00:45:34,375
Michelle, I'm so sorry...
I wanted to tell you before...

568
00:45:34,583 --> 00:45:36,460
I tried, I tried to tell you...

569
00:45:38,792 --> 00:45:39,957
What was that?

570
00:45:39,958 --> 00:45:41,358
Come on! Come on girls..., come on!

571
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:45,585
Emma, where were you?

572
00:45:46,542 --> 00:45:47,542
With her.

573
00:45:48,167 --> 00:45:49,167
She is Doe.

574
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:51,919
She wants to help us.

575
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:54,877
She says that somebody wants to hurt us.

576
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:56,718
That's what the girl told me too.

577
00:45:56,719 --> 00:45:57,916
He'll find you.

578
00:45:57,917 --> 00:45:58,632
What?

579
00:45:58,633 --> 00:45:59,633
Who?

580
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:00,750
My father.

581
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:05,292
Ever since my mother hanged herself
everything changed...

582
00:46:06,792 --> 00:46:09,341
He lost it, he closed the factory and...

583
00:46:09,342 --> 00:46:10,926
Where's this guy now?

584
00:46:12,417 --> 00:46:14,340
He could be anywhere.

585
00:46:15,417 --> 00:46:19,718
That's completely irrelevant to
anything we are talking about...

586
00:46:19,958 --> 00:46:23,087
Where is Steve?

587
00:46:23,833 --> 00:46:25,551
It's too late for him.

588
00:46:27,167 --> 00:46:30,291
Ok... I'm pretty done
with playing games...

589
00:46:30,292 --> 00:46:33,626
So you're gonna tell me where Steve is,
right now!

590
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:35,709
You must leave, right now.

591
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,666
I'm not going anywhere without Steve!

592
00:46:37,667 --> 00:46:39,761
You'd better talk about his whereabouts...
Michelle!

593
00:46:39,762 --> 00:46:42,082
Michelle! Look at you anywhere.

594
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:45,166
Ok... This person, who by the way
we don't even know...

595
00:46:45,167 --> 00:46:48,171
tells us some bullshit stories,
and we are just supposed to believe her?

596
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:49,919
Are we really that stupid?

597
00:46:50,542 --> 00:46:52,041
You shouldn't shout.

598
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:54,541
And now you're telling me to shut up?

599
00:46:54,542 --> 00:46:56,957
Who the fuck do you think you are?!

600
00:46:56,958 --> 00:46:59,632
Not told you to shut up,
she just told you to keep it low.

601
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:01,965
Michelle, the girl told me be quiet too.

602
00:47:01,966 --> 00:47:03,801
Come on Sam, not you too...

603
00:47:06,417 --> 00:47:08,886
Hey! hey! I'm not done
talking to you!

604
00:47:10,958 --> 00:47:12,628
Get the door, Sam!
What are you doing?!

605
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:14,548
Get the door, come on...
Take her down!

606
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:17,551
Come on! Down here!

607
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,343
Last chance idiot!

608
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,049
Where is Steve?!

609
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,094
He used to hit us all the time.

610
00:47:28,625 --> 00:47:30,252
He locked us in the house...

611
00:47:31,917 --> 00:47:34,841
and things would calm down
if we stayed quiet.

612
00:47:37,917 --> 00:47:41,217
He blamed us for our mother's death,
so we had to do something.

613
00:47:41,218 --> 00:47:43,832
Oh yeah... I'm so heartbroken for you!

614
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:47,258
Look lady..., do you know where
our friend is, or not?!

615
00:47:47,958 --> 00:47:50,052
Michael would come to make fun of us...

616
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:53,457
and that really bothered my father.

617
00:47:53,458 --> 00:47:54,458
What!?

618
00:47:54,917 --> 00:47:56,169
They all came...

619
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:59,131
and they hurt us, they hurt us bad...

620
00:48:00,083 --> 00:48:03,007
and all my father wanted
was silence, and...

621
00:48:04,167 --> 00:48:05,291
he got it.

622
00:48:05,292 --> 00:48:06,919
Michelle, please... no...

623
00:48:08,542 --> 00:48:11,751
Your daughter is gonna be called
the same as my baby sister.

624
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:18,999
What the fuck are you talking about?!

625
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,924
Where is Steve?!

626
00:48:22,417 --> 00:48:23,634
Dead...

627
00:48:25,042 --> 00:48:26,919
like the baby you lost.

628
00:48:32,708 --> 00:48:34,426
How do you know that?

629
00:48:42,958 --> 00:48:44,460
We have to get out of here.

630
00:48:46,042 --> 00:48:47,544
Emma, where's Sophie and Nick?

631
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:50,093
Emma! Where are they?!

632
00:48:50,792 --> 00:48:52,957
I though they were with you...

633
00:48:52,958 --> 00:48:54,551
they tried to get into the house...

634
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:57,130
We have to find them, oh my god!

635
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:03,002
What the fuck was that!

636
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:27,459
Oh my god!

637
00:49:30,125 --> 00:49:31,172
Her lips...

638
00:49:32,042 --> 00:49:33,385
just like the girl.

639
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:35,167
Who?

640
00:49:35,208 --> 00:49:38,417
I won't let him hurt her...

641
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:40,083
Her...

642
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:47,458
Sam...

643
00:49:47,958 --> 00:49:49,335
Help!

644
00:49:50,667 --> 00:49:51,667
Come on!

645
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:02,926
Oh my god!

646
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,542
Doe?

647
00:50:05,542 --> 00:50:07,215
What the hell happened?!

648
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:29,250
Go...

649
00:50:29,792 --> 00:50:30,918
Get out of here...

650
00:50:31,625 --> 00:50:32,501
Run...

651
00:50:32,502 --> 00:50:34,582
Go! Go! Run! Go!

652
00:50:34,583 --> 00:50:36,666
Everybody, out! Go!

653
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:37,839
Open the door!

654
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:41,174
Open the door!
Block that door!

655
00:50:43,667 --> 00:50:45,635
Open!
It's locked!

656
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:47,260
Sam, open the door!

657
00:50:48,083 --> 00:50:49,083
Come on!

658
00:50:49,958 --> 00:50:52,006
Just run! Come on!

659
00:50:54,917 --> 00:50:55,917
Samantha!

660
00:50:56,083 --> 00:50:57,209
Come with me!

661
00:59:26,417 --> 00:59:27,589
Michelle!

662
00:59:57,083 --> 00:59:58,083
Bruce!

663
01:00:03,542 --> 01:00:04,168
Ok...

664
01:00:04,169 --> 01:00:05,794
This way..., come on!

665
01:00:39,042 --> 01:00:40,669
Please don't go!

666
01:00:47,833 --> 01:00:48,833
Help us!

667
01:01:06,208 --> 01:01:08,176
He only wants you...

668
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:11,093
let your boyfriend go...

669
01:01:12,042 --> 01:01:13,715
if you want to save him.

670
01:01:14,208 --> 01:01:15,209
Samantha!

671
01:01:15,917 --> 01:01:16,541
What is it?!

672
01:01:16,542 --> 01:01:17,542
Don't go!

673
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:20,542
Come on!

674
01:01:21,833 --> 01:01:22,833
Come on!

675
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,167
Run!

676
01:01:37,542 --> 01:01:38,919
It's locked!
Samy!

677
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:00,333
Please...

678
01:02:01,792 --> 01:02:02,918
we're just looking for help!

679
01:02:03,958 --> 01:02:05,255
You have to help us.

680
01:02:05,583 --> 01:02:06,874
You woke him up...

681
01:02:06,875 --> 01:02:08,213
you shouldn't be here...

682
01:02:08,214 --> 01:02:09,835
Our friends have disappeared!

683
01:02:10,792 --> 01:02:12,009
Leave me alone.

684
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:13,752
He's gone crazy!

685
01:02:13,958 --> 01:02:14,958
Ok!

686
01:02:15,125 --> 01:02:17,469
He's killed Doe!
He's killed his own daughter!

687
01:02:23,083 --> 01:02:25,302
Doe has been dead for a long time...

688
01:02:25,583 --> 01:02:26,926
I buried all of them...

689
01:02:27,083 --> 01:02:28,916
now he knows where I am...

690
01:02:28,917 --> 01:02:30,840
and it's time to deal with what I did.

691
01:02:31,417 --> 01:02:33,340
He won't leave you alive...

692
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:35,832
if he doesn't want to.

693
01:02:35,833 --> 01:02:37,176
Will see about that!
Sure you will!

694
01:02:37,177 --> 01:02:39,636
Come on Samantha! Run! Run!

695
01:02:43,042 --> 01:02:44,042
Bruce!

696
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,626
Come on!
I'm trying!

697
01:02:49,627 --> 01:02:52,094
Bruce... We have to leave
this village right now!

698
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:53,250
I'm trying!

699
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:54,459
Bruce, come on!

700
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:55,835
Calm down, Samy!

701
01:03:12,167 --> 01:03:13,669
We took the help to get out of here.

702
01:03:19,958 --> 01:03:20,958
It's Nick!

703
01:03:21,875 --> 01:03:23,047
I've got to help him.

704
01:03:24,042 --> 01:03:25,042
Nick!

705
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:27,922
Nick! Come on man!

706
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:32,924
I warned you...

707
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
What's the matter?

708
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:36,500
Come on!

709
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:37,833
Jesus!

710
01:03:41,875 --> 01:03:42,875
Nick!

711
01:03:47,083 --> 01:03:48,209
Samantha!

712
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:11,333
Bruce!

713
01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:15,375
Bruce!

714
01:04:20,167 --> 01:04:21,167
Bruce!

715
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:39,792
Bruce!

716
01:04:50,625 --> 01:04:51,717
Samantha!

717
01:04:53,042 --> 01:04:54,042
Run!

718
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:00,797
Samantha!

719
01:05:04,833 --> 01:05:05,833
Samantha!

720
01:06:31,083 --> 01:06:32,082
Don't move.

721
01:06:32,083 --> 01:06:32,957
He's outside!

722
01:06:32,958 --> 01:06:33,958
Ok...

723
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,378
I know, it's been like this for
so many years, honey...

724
01:06:40,708 --> 01:06:41,800
Do you want some water?

725
01:06:53,083 --> 01:06:54,426
Sit down... sit down.

726
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,010
Come on... sit down.

727
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:02,002
Who killed Steve?

728
01:07:03,958 --> 01:07:06,586
I'll try to explain you...
don't worry, don't' worry... ok?

729
01:07:11,333 --> 01:07:14,633
His wife hanged herself because
she couldn't leave in silence.

730
01:07:15,542 --> 01:07:18,044
That crazy man closed the fish factory...

731
01:07:18,045 --> 01:07:22,252
and locked himself up with his daughters
in the most inscrutable silence.

732
01:07:23,667 --> 01:07:26,341
We knew that he mistreated his daughters,

733
01:07:26,708 --> 01:07:30,542
but it never dawned on us that
he would kill one of our children.

734
01:07:31,458 --> 01:07:34,462
We found Michael dead in the woods,
near his house.

735
01:07:37,458 --> 01:07:39,460
Hatred possessed all of us.

736
01:07:39,958 --> 01:07:41,756
We wanted revenge.

737
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:45,802
An eye for an eye,
and a tooth for a tooth.

738
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:51,633
The dogs followed the murderer's scent
up to the house on the hill.

739
01:07:52,833 --> 01:07:55,052
We knew what we did was wrong...

740
01:07:55,667 --> 01:07:57,795
and we went too far.

741
01:08:00,792 --> 01:08:02,920
Those girls suffered so much...

742
01:08:03,542 --> 01:08:05,670
but it wasn't their fault at all.

743
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:09,174
We let the dogs go so
they could finish him off.

744
01:08:11,708 --> 01:08:13,255
But to our horror...

745
01:08:13,833 --> 01:08:15,676
they attacked the girls instead...

746
01:08:16,208 --> 01:08:18,552
possessed by our rage.

747
01:08:19,125 --> 01:08:22,334
We couldn't do anything
for those poor creatures.

748
01:08:24,583 --> 01:08:29,464
Before he died, he said he would come
back to kill us one by one...

749
01:08:29,958 --> 01:08:33,917
and seal our lips for
telling all those lies.

750
01:08:34,875 --> 01:08:36,291
After a short while,

751
01:08:36,292 --> 01:08:40,627
the people from the town started
appearing dead with their lips Doe up.

752
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:43,291
We all knew it was him,

753
01:08:43,292 --> 01:08:45,624
and he's still with us...

754
01:08:45,625 --> 01:08:49,957
and he will be, until he finishes
carrying out his promise...

755
01:08:49,958 --> 01:08:52,086
and gets his daughters back.

756
01:08:53,958 --> 01:08:55,801
We dug up their graves...

757
01:08:56,417 --> 01:08:58,590
but the bodies were never found...

758
01:08:58,591 --> 01:08:59,835
never.

759
01:09:06,167 --> 01:09:07,168
Listen...

760
01:09:08,125 --> 01:09:13,124
nobody can leave here
until what's his is returned.

761
01:09:13,125 --> 01:09:16,005
Well, I'm not staying.., I'm taking the
boat and I'm getting out of here.

762
01:09:16,458 --> 01:09:18,672
But everybody who's tried that has died.

763
01:09:18,673 --> 01:09:20,590
What the hell are we supposed to do?!

764
01:09:20,591 --> 01:09:22,551
Just live in silence, honey.

765
01:09:22,792 --> 01:09:24,590
But what about your son?

766
01:09:24,875 --> 01:09:28,709
He's not my son, his real parents
didn't listen to me either,

767
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:30,551
just like you aren't.

768
01:09:36,708 --> 01:09:39,382
Then we have to try to leave
without making any noise.

769
01:09:39,383 --> 01:09:41,423
Honey, he knows you're here.

770
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:45,628
We have to take our chances...

771
01:09:46,125 --> 01:09:47,125
Yes?"

772
01:09:48,875 --> 01:09:49,875
Yes?

773
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:07,752
I'm cold...

774
01:12:08,417 --> 01:12:10,636
I feel so alone...

775
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:14,720
and I only have bad memories.

776
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:20,918
I suffer all the pain
that my father causes.

777
01:12:23,333 --> 01:12:25,381
He'll come to look for you...

778
01:12:25,833 --> 01:12:31,590
and he'll tell you that everything will be
different when your daughter is born.

779
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:39,008
Tell him..., that not until
he stops killing...

780
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:42,174
will I be able to go in peace.

781
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,423
Only you can save us.

782
01:12:51,792 --> 01:12:55,217
Remember everything that I've told you...

783
01:12:55,958 --> 01:12:59,383
or else, he'll kill you
when your daughter is born.

784
01:13:01,333 --> 01:13:03,210
You have to tell.

785
01:13:04,792 --> 01:13:09,172
I hope that the pain will be
washed away with time...

786
01:13:09,792 --> 01:13:13,092
like the sand disappears in the sea.

787
01:13:31,917 --> 01:13:33,760
Now you're both safe.

788
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,717
Why?

789
01:13:53,958 --> 01:13:55,335
Michael would...

790
01:13:57,542 --> 01:13:59,010
come and laugh at us.

791
01:14:10,458 --> 01:14:13,086
Until one day I killed him
and sealed his lips shut...

792
01:14:14,833 --> 01:14:16,835
to never hear that laugh again.

793
01:14:18,375 --> 01:14:21,219
We were afraid that our father
would punish us...

794
01:14:22,667 --> 01:14:24,340
and we couldn't let that happen.

795
01:14:26,208 --> 01:14:28,461
I got the people on the village to...

796
01:14:29,167 --> 01:14:31,886
to believe that it was my father
that killed him.

797
01:14:34,792 --> 01:14:38,922
He had to pay for the death of my mother
and everything he did to us.

798
01:14:40,917 --> 01:14:42,385
They came after...

799
01:14:43,333 --> 01:14:44,755
and buried...

800
01:14:45,583 --> 01:14:46,880
the three of us.

801
01:14:52,667 --> 01:14:54,465
They all though I was dead...

802
01:15:01,208 --> 01:15:02,710
but I survived.

803
01:15:56,042 --> 01:15:57,715
It's not our fault.

804
01:15:57,875 --> 01:16:00,344
Everybody had to pay
for killing my sister.

805
01:16:05,875 --> 01:16:07,752
But you're gonna save them.

806
01:16:12,125 --> 01:16:14,298
Once my little sister is born...

807
01:16:16,292 --> 01:16:18,169
everything will be different.
