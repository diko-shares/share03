1
00:02:00.955 --> 00:02:02.055
Movement.

2
00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:04.455
Two men.

3
00:02:06.055 --> 00:02:07.455
Approximately

4
00:02:09.955 --> 00:02:11.656
40 goats.

5
00:02:11.856 --> 00:02:15.356
They're not on anybody's side.
We don't have to shoot them.

6
00:02:16.556 --> 00:02:17.656
Egress?

7
00:02:18.456 --> 00:02:23.056
Primary over the top, secondary
down the road, tertiary to the river.

8
00:02:24.556 --> 00:02:27.556
No one can track you through the water
except a fish.

9
00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:40.457
Sarah's headed off to nursing school
next month.

10
00:02:41.557 --> 00:02:43.057
She sewed that herself.

11
00:02:43.357 --> 00:02:44.557
It's beautiful.

12
00:02:46.757 --> 00:02:48.958
You sure this is
a peacekeeping mission?

13
00:02:49.758 --> 00:02:52.458
Normally there isn't any peace
to start with.

14
00:02:54.458 --> 00:02:56.458
This shit's awful calm.

15
00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:10.335
-Not at these coordinates.
-Yes, sir.

16
00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:11.535
Go ahead and plot an alternate.

17
00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:12.759
Yes, sir.

18
00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:16.159
<i>Command Post, Command Post,
this is TS-129, over.</i>

19
00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.859
Sir, I have visual confirmation
of TS-129's current position.

20
00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.459
<i>Mission accomplished, en route to
extract site. Distance eight klicks. Over.</i>

21
00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:25.460
<i>Command Post, Command Post,

22
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.160
<i>I have friendly forces moving
towards extraction point, over.</i>

23
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.560
Heads up, our boys are coming through.

24
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.460
<i>Viper, this is CP. Be advised,</i>

25
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.760
<i>possible hostile forces approaching
TS-129 at their 12:00.</i>

26
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.260
Call them out.

27
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.660
Target.

28
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.160
Sector Bravo, deep.

29
00:03:42.361 --> 00:03:44.461
Vehicle, belt-fed weapon.

30
00:03:44.761 --> 00:03:45.761
Range it.

31
00:03:50.161 --> 00:03:51.861
870 yards and closing.

32
00:03:52.861 --> 00:03:55.261
Wind, three-quarter value, push 2 left.

33
00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:59.461
900 yards. Wide spot on the road.

34
00:04:01.162 --> 00:04:02.262
On target.

35
00:04:02.462 --> 00:04:03.662
Hold scope.

36
00:04:03.862 --> 00:04:05.162
Fire when ready.

37
00:04:08.762 --> 00:04:09.762
Hit.

38
00:04:15.662 --> 00:04:18.562
<i>Command Post, this is Viper.
Hostile threat down, over.</i>

39
00:04:18.762 --> 00:04:22.063
<i>Viper, this is Command Post.
We copy your traffic, over.</i>

40
00:04:32.463 --> 00:04:34.663
Call it in. It's time to go.

41
00:04:35.063 --> 00:04:36.939
Command Post, this is Viper.
Mission accomplished.

42
00:04:36.963 --> 00:04:37.964
-Packing up.
-Shit!

43
00:04:38.164 --> 00:04:41.364
<i>Viper, be advised larger hostile forces
approaching near sector Bravo.</i>

44
00:04:41.564 --> 00:04:43.764
Weren't supposed to be
hostiles that close!

45
00:04:51.064 --> 00:04:55.164
Crooked tree.
675, 30 miles an hour, three-mil lead.

46
00:05:00.865 --> 00:05:04.265
Position to machine gun.
900, three-quarter value.

47
00:05:04.865 --> 00:05:06.065
Fire when ready.

48
00:05:10.265 --> 00:05:13.765
<i>Jefe. 920. Three-quarter value.</i>

49
00:05:14.065 --> 00:05:16.966
-I see it, Donnie. I see it.
-Fire when ready.

50
00:05:25.866 --> 00:05:28.186
-They don't know where we are.
-But they might get lucky!

51
00:05:30.666 --> 00:05:32.666
<i>Command Post, Command Post,
this is Viper.</i>

52
00:05:32.866 --> 00:05:34.967
<i>Enemy forces
have been stopped. Break.</i>

53
00:05:35.267 --> 00:05:37.867
<i>Friendlies are continuing on
to extract point. Break.</i>

54
00:05:38.067 --> 00:05:41.767
<i>We're receiving small arms and
indirect fire from hostile troops. Break.</i>

55
00:05:44.667 --> 00:05:46.067
Command Post, do you read me?

56
00:05:46.267 --> 00:05:47.467
Shut it down.

57
00:05:47.567 --> 00:05:48.667
They're highly-trained men,

58
00:05:48.867 --> 00:05:51.468
eight kilometres inside a country
we are not supposed to be in.

59
00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:53.968
I'm sure they'll get out just fine.
Shut it down now.

60
00:05:54.168 --> 00:05:55.568
<i>Radio check. Do you read me?</i>

61
00:05:55.768 --> 00:05:57.768
-Okay, wrap it up. Let's go!
<i>-Do you read me?</i>

62
00:05:57.868 --> 00:06:00.388
-Pull out those tracks.
-Pull out those tracks and pack it up!

63
00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:14.369
Intelligence said
they didn't have air support!

64
00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:15.669
Call it in!

65
00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:21.669
Shit! The channel's down!

66
00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:22.969
That's impossible!

67
00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:24.469
The comm link's dead!

68
00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:27.269
They left us here.
Don't worry, we're getting home!

69
00:07:09.172 --> 00:07:10.272
Donnie?

70
00:07:12.872 --> 00:07:14.072
Donnie!

71
00:08:42.777 --> 00:08:44.177
Come on, boy!

72
00:08:45.977 --> 00:08:47.177
Come on, Sam!

73
00:08:48.977 --> 00:08:50.977
What're you doing, huh?
What're you doing?

74
00:08:51.177 --> 00:08:52.177
Come on.

75
00:08:52.377 --> 00:08:53.577
What? I got nothing.

76
00:08:53.677 --> 00:08:54.677
What?

77
00:08:55.778 --> 00:08:57.778
All right, come on, let's go. Let's go.

78
00:09:00.178 --> 00:09:01.578
That's a good boy.

79
00:09:14.779 --> 00:09:16.279
Good boy.

80
00:09:22.079 --> 00:09:24.779
{\an8}Well, let's see what lies
they're trying to sell us today.

81
00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:30.079
Here, boy.

82
00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:32.479
Good boy.

83
00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.380
Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger.

84
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.080
USMC, retired.

85
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.481
He is the best there is.

86
00:09:51.781 --> 00:09:54.181
His last assignment went wrong.

87
00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:57.581
Put in unfriendly territory on a loan-out
and left as expendable.

88
00:09:57.881 --> 00:10:01.181
Opposing force sent an attack
helicopter and a hundred-man company.

89
00:10:01.381 --> 00:10:04.081
His best friend and spotter was killed.

90
00:10:04.281 --> 00:10:05.481
No official report.

91
00:10:05.681 --> 00:10:09.782
Ghost report says he inflicted
70 percent casualties, the rest fled.

92
00:10:09.982 --> 00:10:11.982
The agency asset
that left them there to die?

93
00:10:12.182 --> 00:10:15.182
Suddenly removed from
the face of the earth two weeks after.

94
00:10:15.582 --> 00:10:17.382
They never laid it at Bob Lee's feet.

95
00:10:17.582 --> 00:10:19.182
He retired a week later.

96
00:10:19.282 --> 00:10:22.282
I guess Bob Lee didn't think
he was expendable.

97
00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:34.783
Grows and shoots his own food.

98
00:10:34.983 --> 00:10:37.183
Yeah, he rarely ventures out at all.

99
00:10:37.383 --> 00:10:41.283
This is a man
with a history of duty and patriotism.

100
00:10:41.483 --> 00:10:44.983
-Not as punch lines, but as core beliefs.
-Aye.

101
00:10:45.383 --> 00:10:48.584
Some people don't know what to do
when their belief system collapses.

102
00:10:49.484 --> 00:10:51.184
Bob Lee is one of those.

103
00:11:01.284 --> 00:11:02.484
You sure, boy?

104
00:11:15.785 --> 00:11:19.185
Nope. I ain't buying. I don't want any.

105
00:11:19.485 --> 00:11:22.985
You guys turn around and go back
to wherever you came from.

106
00:11:23.986 --> 00:11:26.386
Bob Lee Swagger?

107
00:11:26.586 --> 00:11:28.486
My name is Colonel Isaac Johnson.

108
00:11:28.986 --> 00:11:30.186
You're a hard man to find.

109
00:11:30.286 --> 00:11:31.486
But not hard enough.

110
00:11:31.686 --> 00:11:33.186
Come a long way to see you.

111
00:11:33.586 --> 00:11:35.486
We have some business
needs your attention.

112
00:11:35.586 --> 00:11:37.262
You wanna use your low gear
going down the road

113
00:11:37.286 --> 00:11:38.286
or your brakes'll go.

114
00:11:38.586 --> 00:11:41.286
-Come here. Come here, boy.
-Don't do that.

115
00:11:42.487 --> 00:11:45.687
Come near the porch I didn't invite you,
you'd have to shoot the dog.

116
00:11:46.987 --> 00:11:48.387
That's a slow draw you got there.

117
00:11:48.587 --> 00:11:49.987
Sure you want to do that?

118
00:11:50.487 --> 00:11:52.063
Shoot a dog in this county
on a man's land,

119
00:11:52.087 --> 00:11:54.463
I'd bury you in the hill,
and tell the sheriff a month or two later.

120
00:11:54.487 --> 00:11:55.587
He understands.

121
00:11:57.087 --> 00:11:58.487
Take your hand off your weapon.

122
00:11:58.787 --> 00:11:59.787
Slowly.

123
00:12:00.188 --> 00:12:03.088
So the gunnery sergeant
doesn't have to bury you in the hill.

124
00:12:05.388 --> 00:12:07.088
I don't carry a gun.

125
00:12:11.488 --> 00:12:12.488
You know what that is?

126
00:12:12.788 --> 00:12:14.588
It's a Congressional Medal of Honour.

127
00:12:15.188 --> 00:12:16.688
They don't hand those out easy.

128
00:12:16.888 --> 00:12:17.988
Yours?

129
00:12:18.188 --> 00:12:19.489
Yeah.

130
00:12:19.589 --> 00:12:21.489
Your father had one, didn't he?

131
00:12:21.689 --> 00:12:23.189
What did you do?

132
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:26.989
Something foolhardy.
Kept some other boys alive.

133
00:12:27.289 --> 00:12:28.989
Will you give me five minutes?

134
00:12:31.489 --> 00:12:33.089
Yeah, your dog stays outside.

135
00:12:34.489 --> 00:12:35.989
Come on, boy. Get in there.

136
00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:41.390
I need you to plan
a presidential assassination.

137
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:42.690
Whose president?

138
00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:43.890
Ours.

139
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:46.890
I didn't say "execute".

140
00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:48.790
Plan.

141
00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:51.490
So it can be stopped.

142
00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:55.190
There's gonna be an attempt on the life
of the President in the next two weeks.

143
00:12:55.391 --> 00:12:58.591
Code was broken
on an anonymous transmission.

144
00:13:00.591 --> 00:13:02.291
It was internal.

145
00:13:02.491 --> 00:13:04.791
We can't go to the usual agencies.

146
00:13:04.991 --> 00:13:07.691
The government itself
has been penetrated.

147
00:13:07.891 --> 00:13:13.091
The President has three
public engagements during that time.

148
00:13:13.391 --> 00:13:17.792
Baltimore, Philadelphia,
Washington, D.C.

149
00:13:18.092 --> 00:13:20.792
Standard Secret Service
protective cordon

150
00:13:21.192 --> 00:13:23.792
is out to 880 yards.

151
00:13:23.992 --> 00:13:28.492
But this intercept claims that the shot
will be taken from beyond a mile.

152
00:13:28.792 --> 00:13:31.592
We need you to scout,
tell us how you would do it,

153
00:13:32.092 --> 00:13:33.493
so we could stop it.

154
00:13:34.493 --> 00:13:38.893
I'm not entirely convinced
that a shot like this could be made.

155
00:13:40.493 --> 00:13:42.593
But let's not take the chance.

156
00:13:43.893 --> 00:13:45.993
Your longer shots
were never confirmed.

157
00:13:46.193 --> 00:13:47.993
That's because long shots
generally go places

158
00:13:48.193 --> 00:13:50.794
you wouldn't wanna have
to go afterwards to confirm them.

159
00:13:51.094 --> 00:13:53.594
Confirmation's a desk pogue's problem.

160
00:13:54.494 --> 00:13:56.694
You know what it takes
to make a shot at that range?

161
00:13:56.894 --> 00:13:58.334
Everything comes into play that far.

162
00:13:58.494 --> 00:14:01.494
Humidity, elevation, temperature,
wind, spindrift.

163
00:14:01.694 --> 00:14:03.134
There's a 6-to10-second flight time

164
00:14:03.194 --> 00:14:05.354
so you have to shoot
at where the target's going to be.

165
00:14:05.394 --> 00:14:08.394
Even the Coriolis effect,
the spin of the Earth, comes into play.

166
00:14:08.594 --> 00:14:10.871
President'll be wearing body armour.
That means a headshot,

167
00:14:10.895 --> 00:14:11.995
at over a mile.

168
00:14:12.295 --> 00:14:14.471
You believe there's a shooter involved
capable of making this shot?

169
00:14:14.495 --> 00:14:15.695
Yes.

170
00:14:15.895 --> 00:14:18.371
Well, then you got a real problem.
You need to find the shooter.

171
00:14:18.395 --> 00:14:20.695
That's being worked on
from another direction.

172
00:14:20.895 --> 00:14:22.495
We need you to do this.

173
00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:24.595
Don't really like the President much.

174
00:14:24.795 --> 00:14:26.595
Didn't like the one before
that much, either.

175
00:14:26.695 --> 00:14:28.496
You like the idea of the President?

176
00:14:28.896 --> 00:14:30.296
Living in a free country?

177
00:14:30.596 --> 00:14:32.896
Do we allow America
to be ruled by thugs?

178
00:14:33.096 --> 00:14:34.796
Sure, some years we do.

179
00:14:36.096 --> 00:14:38.796
I believe you stood before a flag

180
00:14:39.496 --> 00:14:40.696
and solemnly swore

181
00:14:41.696 --> 00:14:45.396
that you'd support and defend
the Constitution of the United States

182
00:14:45.596 --> 00:14:47.197
against all enemies,

183
00:14:47.397 --> 00:14:48.897
foreign and domestic.

184
00:14:49.197 --> 00:14:50.997
I think your five minutes is up.

185
00:15:00.497 --> 00:15:01.997
Listen to me, son.

186
00:15:04.197 --> 00:15:06.198
I don't want you to turn on the TV
next week

187
00:15:07.498 --> 00:15:09.698
and see the President dead,

188
00:15:09.898 --> 00:15:12.398
and know you could've done
something about it.

189
00:15:13.398 --> 00:15:15.398
Don't do that to yourself.

190
00:15:36.199 --> 00:15:37.899
Is that the new one?

191
00:15:38.199 --> 00:15:39.299
The truck.

192
00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:42.300
You got the big engine in there?

193
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.800
Wow, look at that, huh? Eight-litre V8.

194
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:49.700
Thing's so big, EPA doesn't even bother
to give you the gas mileage for it.

195
00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.400
You mind if I take a picture?

196
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.800
This is beautiful.

197
00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.901
Someone will be at this number
night or day.

198
00:16:07.301 --> 00:16:09.801
You see what he did?
He didn't need a photo of the engine.

199
00:16:10.001 --> 00:16:12.201
No, he doesn't give a rat's ass
about the engine.

200
00:16:12.401 --> 00:16:13.801
He's trained in counterintel.

201
00:16:14.001 --> 00:16:16.201
Backed up far enough
to take a picture of the plates.

202
00:16:16.401 --> 00:16:17.801
This is our guy.

203
00:16:18.002 --> 00:16:19.402
I thought he turned you down.

204
00:16:19.602 --> 00:16:21.902
He said yes. He just doesn't know it yet.

205
00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:38.806
1,760's a mile.

206
00:17:39.706 --> 00:17:43.206
It's a far piece, Sam.
Think the President ought to worry?

207
00:18:15.208 --> 00:18:16.808
Yeah, I think he better worry.

208
00:18:31.609 --> 00:18:33.309
Yeah, he'll be fine.

209
00:18:34.509 --> 00:18:38.309
Just feed him once a day. Read him
a few ballistics tables if he looks Ionely.

210
00:18:38.509 --> 00:18:39.709
Yep. I'm out.

211
00:18:41.609 --> 00:18:43.009
Come here, buddy.

212
00:18:43.809 --> 00:18:45.009
Okay.

213
00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:49.010
Think you'll be able to tough it out
without me for a couple days?

214
00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:51.010
Yeah.

215
00:20:18.115 --> 00:20:20.215
<i>This is Command Post.
What's your status? Over.</i>

216
00:20:20.415 --> 00:20:22.115
Yeah, we're finishing up here on 6th.

217
00:20:22.315 --> 00:20:25.015
<i>Roger that. We copy.
Checkpoint down, over.</i>

218
00:20:38.016 --> 00:20:42.616
Before you stands Independence Hall,
the birthplace of the United States

219
00:20:43.016 --> 00:20:45.716
and one of the most important buildings
in American history.

220
00:20:46.316 --> 00:20:48.016
Built in 1732...

221
00:20:48.216 --> 00:20:50.216
Keep a visual eye on 72nd...

222
00:20:50.416 --> 00:20:52.792
...both the Declaration of Independence
and the U.S. Constitution

223
00:20:52.816 --> 00:20:54.917
were debated and signed here.

224
00:21:03.617 --> 00:21:04.617
Out of the three cities,

225
00:21:04.717 --> 00:21:07.517
there's only one with
a reasonably high chance of success.

226
00:21:08.317 --> 00:21:09.557
There was no room in Baltimore.

227
00:21:09.617 --> 00:21:11.193
Street isn't wide enough to correct
for the windage,

228
00:21:11.217 --> 00:21:12.817
buildings are in the way.

229
00:21:13.118 --> 00:21:14.518
D.C.'s a pure suicide mission.

230
00:21:14.718 --> 00:21:16.894
I mean, unless you're sure
your shooter's interested in 70 virgins

231
00:21:16.918 --> 00:21:18.094
waiting for him in the afterlife,

232
00:21:18.118 --> 00:21:19.518
I'd rule that out.

233
00:21:19.718 --> 00:21:21.118
Shot's got to be taken from Philly.

234
00:21:21.618 --> 00:21:23.418
<i>From beyond 1,800 yards, though.</i>

235
00:21:23.618 --> 00:21:25.018
<i>It's one of six possible locations,</i>

236
00:21:25.218 --> 00:21:28.018
<i>approximately five storeys
above the President's location.</i>

237
00:21:28.718 --> 00:21:31.218
<i>Flight time of the bullet that distance
is five to six seconds.</i>

238
00:21:31.419 --> 00:21:32.795
<i>They'll have to wait
till he takes the podium,</i>

239
00:21:32.819 --> 00:21:34.319
<i>several lines into his speech.</i>

240
00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:37.119
<i>That way he'd be completely static,
obviously at his most exposed.</i>

241
00:21:37.419 --> 00:21:39.219
<i>Shot requires a large-calibre weapon.</i>

242
00:21:39.319 --> 00:21:41.919
<i>Expect the bullet to be handmade,
bronzed alloy turned on a lathe.</i>

243
00:21:42.319 --> 00:21:43.495
<i>Slightly lower ballistics coefficient,</i>

244
00:21:43.519 --> 00:21:44.619
touch more slippery.

245
00:21:44.819 --> 00:21:46.219
Least that's what I'd do.

246
00:21:46.419 --> 00:21:48.619
You can kill him from that far away?

247
00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.796
Mile and a half, the bullet's
going to strike with more energy

248
00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:53.980
than a.44 Magnum point blank.

249
00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:55.720
Yeah, I think you can kill him.

250
00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.520
<i>The challenge is the wind.</i>

251
00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.520
<i>Lightest breeze uncorrected
at that distance</i>

252
00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.020
<i>is enough to ruin the shot.</i>

253
00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.220
<i>He's gonna need indicators between
the podium and the shooting position.</i>

254
00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.920
<i>Velocity corrections are easy,</i>

255
00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.896
<i>but an angle change,
that becomes a trig problem.</i>

256
00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.821
<i>He's gotta do that in his head on the fly.</i>

257
00:22:10.021 --> 00:22:12.901
<i>Without something to gauge, your shot's
just too tough to make cold bore.</i>

258
00:22:13.121 --> 00:22:16.021
<i>Impressive recon and report, son.</i>

259
00:22:16.221 --> 00:22:18.121
<i>Move too soon, we lose him.</i>

260
00:22:18.321 --> 00:22:19.621
<i>We want to take him alive.</i>

261
00:22:20.321 --> 00:22:23.221
If we don't know who hired him,
it could just happen again.

262
00:22:24.621 --> 00:22:28.722
We'll have six
three-man teams standing by.

263
00:22:30.022 --> 00:22:31.522
Gunnery Sergeant Swagger?

264
00:22:31.722 --> 00:22:32.822
A moment?

265
00:22:35.022 --> 00:22:37.322
You've done your country
a great service, son.

266
00:22:37.522 --> 00:22:38.522
-On the day...
-Look...

267
00:22:38.822 --> 00:22:39.922
Listen.

268
00:22:40.722 --> 00:22:43.922
You're one of the few people
who knows what to look for.

269
00:22:45.023 --> 00:22:46.823
I could use a spotter.

270
00:23:53.826 --> 00:23:55.626
<i>Thank you, Philadelphia.</i>

271
00:23:55.926 --> 00:23:57.826
The President speaks in 20 minutes.

272
00:23:58.026 --> 00:23:59.627
<i>...before you on this stage...</i>

273
00:23:59.827 --> 00:24:02.327
Notify our teams. Check their positions.

274
00:24:02.627 --> 00:24:05.527
<i>...patriots met in Independence Hall
and created a document,</i>

275
00:24:05.727 --> 00:24:07.427
<i>the Declaration of Independence...</i>

276
00:24:07.627 --> 00:24:08.727
Sir?

277
00:24:08.827 --> 00:24:10.603
<i>...and a country,
the United States of America,</i>

278
00:24:10.627 --> 00:24:11.927
<i>that changed the world.</i>

279
00:24:12.227 --> 00:24:14.427
<i>Philadelphia is our home. We are...</i>

280
00:24:14.627 --> 00:24:16.347
<i>Stand by, all teams.
This is Listening Post.</i>

281
00:24:16.527 --> 00:24:19.228
<i>Flashlight's current location
is approaching Checkpoint Jason.</i>

282
00:24:20.328 --> 00:24:22.728
<i>All sniper teams
send update on your sitrep.</i>

283
00:24:23.828 --> 00:24:26.328
<i>Stand by.
Yes, I have a clear line of sight.</i>

284
00:24:33.228 --> 00:24:34.628
<i>Copy that.</i>

285
00:24:34.828 --> 00:24:37.129
<i>Post 18 clear, over.</i>

286
00:24:37.329 --> 00:24:39.829
<i>Post 19, please report.
What's your status?</i>

287
00:24:40.829 --> 00:24:43.329
All clear.
There's really nothing going on here.

288
00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:45.829
<i>The Archbishop of Ethiopia...</i>

289
00:24:46.029 --> 00:24:48.589
<i>The President will be awarding
the Philadelphia Brotherhood Medal</i>

290
00:24:48.729 --> 00:24:51.229
<i>{\an8}to His Grace Desmond Mutumbo,
the Archbishop of Ethiopia.</i>

291
00:24:51.429 --> 00:24:53.829
<i>{\an8}There's been some controversy
surrounding the Archbishop</i>

292
00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:57.130
<i>{\an8}as he's been speaking out
regarding the atrocities in his country.</i>

293
00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:59.690
<i>{\an8}He plans to meet with the President
right after the ceremony</i>

294
00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:01.030
<i>to discuss these matters.</i>

295
00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:03.430
<i>These are great times.</i>

296
00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:06.630
<i>These are historic times.</i>

297
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:10.030
<i>And these are troubled times, as well.</i>

298
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:14.231
<i>This medal that your country...</i>

299
00:25:14.431 --> 00:25:15.531
Yellow ribbons.

300
00:25:15.831 --> 00:25:18.231
Yeah, people put those up
to remember the troops.

301
00:25:18.431 --> 00:25:20.531
No, they tie those low around trees.

302
00:25:21.031 --> 00:25:22.831
These are windage flags.

303
00:25:23.231 --> 00:25:24.607
Roughly the location
I'd have put them in

304
00:25:24.631 --> 00:25:26.131
for a shot from the steeple.

305
00:25:26.331 --> 00:25:28.431
Yeah. Maybe.

306
00:25:28.731 --> 00:25:30.631
No, definitely.
He knows what he's doing.

307
00:25:30.831 --> 00:25:32.872
You guys got a team in place
to take out the church?

308
00:25:32.932 --> 00:25:35.808
They'll move right before the shot
is taken, when his focus is elsewhere.

309
00:25:35.832 --> 00:25:39.332
<i>...raises its head
and confronts freedom,</i>

310
00:25:39.632 --> 00:25:44.732
<i>but slyly, subtly,
chokes it off at the root.</i>

311
00:25:45.032 --> 00:25:48.632
<i>And it is our responsibility</i>

312
00:25:48.832 --> 00:25:50.933
<i>to find these dark weeds.</i>

313
00:25:51.733 --> 00:25:55.733
<i>Flashlight has arrived.
I say again, Flashlight has arrived.</i>

314
00:25:58.133 --> 00:25:59.833
<i>-Lf you just joined us...</I>
-Hi.

315
00:26:00.033 --> 00:26:02.533
Officer Timmons, our local resource.

316
00:26:04.033 --> 00:26:05.233
Bob Lee Swagger.

317
00:26:07.033 --> 00:26:10.034
It is a real honour to meet you.

318
00:26:10.234 --> 00:26:11.834
You're unsnapped, officer.

319
00:26:12.834 --> 00:26:15.234
Shit. Oh, fuck.

320
00:26:15.434 --> 00:26:17.634
Don't want to lose that now, do I?

321
00:26:17.834 --> 00:26:20.234
Again, it's an honour.

322
00:26:23.234 --> 00:26:28.135
<i>...of our stewardship of this great...</i>

323
00:26:28.535 --> 00:26:31.835
-That our guy in the collar?
-The Archbishop of Ethiopia.

324
00:26:32.135 --> 00:26:34.235
He's getting a medal. Know it?

325
00:26:34.435 --> 00:26:36.435
HOA. Horn of Africa. Yeah.

326
00:26:36.635 --> 00:26:38.535
You know I worked there?

327
00:26:38.735 --> 00:26:40.711
You know what they say
about the first thing that you feel

328
00:26:40.735 --> 00:26:42.535
when you shoot a civilian, right?

329
00:26:42.635 --> 00:26:44.836
-Recoil of your rifle?
-Right.

330
00:26:45.036 --> 00:26:46.436
That's very original.

331
00:26:47.336 --> 00:26:49.736
<i>Thank you, Archbishop,
for those inspiring words.</i>

332
00:26:49.936 --> 00:26:52.336
The President speaks next.

333
00:26:52.536 --> 00:26:53.736
All teams stand by.

334
00:26:55.336 --> 00:26:59.136
<i>Agent Gibson, we read your fly-by.
Situation all clear, over.</i>

335
00:26:59.436 --> 00:27:00.936
<i>Agent James, all clear.</i>

336
00:27:01.136 --> 00:27:03.137
<i>Now it gives me enormous pleasure...</i>

337
00:27:03.337 --> 00:27:05.413
-Got wind at three, full value.
<i>...to introduce to you</i>

338
00:27:05.437 --> 00:27:07.237
<i>the President of the United States.</i>

339
00:27:07.337 --> 00:27:09.337
Make it four-and-a-half minutes
of angle.

340
00:27:10.437 --> 00:27:12.437
Three-mil hold, in case the wind dies.

341
00:27:36.038 --> 00:27:37.638
He's loaded.

342
00:27:37.838 --> 00:27:41.639
Altitude, humidity,
temperature accounted for.

343
00:27:43.039 --> 00:27:45.339
<i>In the city that was the capital of...</i>

344
00:27:45.539 --> 00:27:46.939
We got to take him.

345
00:27:47.239 --> 00:27:48.539
Ten seconds.

346
00:27:48.639 --> 00:27:51.239
Wind matches his setup.

<i>-I say again. Flashlight is down.</i>

351

<i>-The President has been shot.
-There's mass confusion...</i>

352
00:28:20.141 --> 00:28:22.041
Has the President been shot?

353
00:28:24.741 --> 00:28:25.941
<i>Right at the church steeple.</i>

354
00:28:29.641 --> 00:28:30.741

355
00:28:31.641 --> 00:28:33.341
How could you fucking miss?

356
00:28:33.541 --> 00:28:36.542
Thirty seconds, clear out.
Chase him down.

357
00:28:36.742 --> 00:28:38.242

-Please.

368

Please help me. Please. They shot me.

369
00:29:24.544 --> 00:29:26.644
-FBI. Put your hands up!
-Please. Hey.

370
00:29:28.944 --> 00:29:29.944
Save me.

371
00:29:31.045 --> 00:29:32.145
What?

372
00:29:40.245 --> 00:29:41.545
Give me the keys.

373
00:29:41.745 --> 00:29:44.345
I didn't shoot the President.
Timmons was a setup.

374
00:29:45.945 --> 00:29:47.045
Help!

375
00:29:48.645 --> 00:29:50.846
FBI! Took my weapon and my car.

376
00:29:55.846 --> 00:29:58.446
Don't worry, I already shot him twice.
You all right?

Timmons called it in?

404
00:31:38.451 --> 00:31:40.552
Right on time, like he was supposed to.

405
00:31:40.752 --> 00:31:42.628
-Before he shot him again.
-Yeah, well, he's been hit twice,

406
00:31:42.652 --> 00:31:45.428
so unless he can stop the bleeding
without going to the hospital or a doctor,

407
00:31:45.452 --> 00:31:46.552
it doesn't really matter.

408
00:31:46.752 --> 00:31:50.452

Dead guy in the front seat?

426
00:34:52.062 --> 00:34:55.962
I want the banks of this river lined
for 30 miles, five minutes ago.

427
00:34:56.362 --> 00:34:58.262
All right.
Let's start the search downriver.

428
00:35:19.163 --> 00:35:22.564
I'm here with Officer Timmons,
who pursued the suspect on foot.

429
00:35:23.064 --> 00:35:25.264
Officer, can you tell us what happened?

430

<i>Early reports indicate that the assailant</i>

441
00:37:37.071 --> 00:37:39.971
<i>{\an8}may have been hit
as many as two times.</i>

442
00:37:40.171 --> 00:37:42.771
<i>{\an8}Meanwhile, the FBI has been
unwilling to comment</i>

443
00:37:42.971 --> 00:37:45.171
<i>{\an8}on information that an agent of theirs</i>

444
00:37:45.371 --> 00:37:49.372

<i>At this time, no sign of Swagger

447
00:37:55.972 --> 00:37:57.872
You have embarrassed this office.

448
00:37:57.972 --> 00:38:02.172
You will be facing a review from the
Office of Professional Responsibility.

449
00:38:02.572 --> 00:38:03.572
Sir...

450
00:38:04.972 --> 00:38:06.673
Well, I don't feel embarrassed.

A Force Recon Marine Scout Sniper

452
00:38:08.973 --> 00:38:11.773
disarmed me three weeks
out of the academy.

453
00:38:11.973 --> 00:38:14.973
If anything, I feel lucky to be alive.

454
00:38:22.773 --> 00:38:25.074
Why'd he say
he didn't shoot the President?

455
00:38:25.274 --> 00:38:26.574
Because he didn't.

456
00:38:30.474 --> 00:38:33.174
Also, he said Timmons was a setup.

457
00:38:33.474 --> 00:38:34.674
He never said that.

458
00:38:34.874 --> 00:38:36.974
City cop managed to spot,
shoot this guy twice.

459
00:38:37.074 --> 00:38:38.474
You got your ass kicked.

460
00:38:38.674 --> 00:38:39.974
You're misremembering.

461
00:38:40.574 --> 00:38:42.774
That's normal
under extreme stress events.

462
00:38:43.875 --> 00:38:45.675
Have you given
your official statement yet?

463
00:38:45.975 --> 00:38:48.775
Because I would be very cautious
about what went in it.

464
00:38:48.975 --> 00:38:52.975
Well, maybe I should wait for the report
to come out, read it and then remember.

465
00:38:53.475 --> 00:38:55.375
Can you believe this fucking guy?

466
00:38:57.875 --> 00:38:58.975
There you go.

467
00:38:59.675 --> 00:39:00.751

00:40:09.179 --> 00:40:12.179
Can't sell you nothing.
Just lost our power.

Please. I got cash,

477
00:40:14.779 --> 00:40:16.380
Ain't gonna be able to find nothing.

478

Please, all I need is a marinade needle,
some salt, some sugar,

479
00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:20.580
couple bottles of water.

480
00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:22.580
How many?

481
00:41:08.582 --> 00:41:11.483
Well, sir, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to hear that.

482
00:41:11.783 --> 00:41:14.183
I'm sure she's
a really nice Christian woman

483
00:41:14.383 --> 00:41:17.083

of those things here.

00:41:17.283 --> 00:41:19.459
-Yeah. Okay, well...
<i>-The FBI released a video letter...</i>

493
00:41:39.984 --> 00:41:42.084

-No.

494
00:42:43.888 --> 00:42:45.588
Yeah, wait, wait. Where was this?

495
00:42:58.188 --> 00:42:59.188
And? Yes?

496
00:42:59.388 --> 00:43:02.469
She thinks it was him, but it was dark
because the power was out in the store.

497

-What'd he buy?
-Gotta be.

498

500
00:43:08.589 --> 00:43:11.089
Salt, water, an injector could be used

but what's with the sugar?

502
00:43:12.489 --> 00:43:13.865
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold that! Hold that!

503
00:43:13.889 --> 00:43:15.465
Well, sugar's been used to treat
battlefield wounds

504
00:43:15.489 --> 00:43:16.489
for hundreds of years.

505
00:43:16.689 --> 00:43:18.789
It has something to do
with osmotic pressure.

506
00:43:18.989 --> 00:43:21.390
It was popular
during the Napoleonic War.

00:45:18.596 --> 00:45:19.896
I know who you are.

515
00:45:20.096 --> 00:45:22.796
You're Bob Lee. Swagger.
Donnie's old partner.

516
00:45:22.996 --> 00:45:25.496
Look, I didn't shoot the President.

517
00:45:25.796 --> 00:45:26.796
I know.

518
00:45:26.996 --> 00:45:27.896
You do?

519
00:45:27.996 --> 00:45:31.397
The President's not dead.
Ethiopian Archbishop is.

520
00:45:33.697 --> 00:45:36.097
Why in the hell
would somebody want to shoot him?

521
00:45:36.897 --> 00:45:38.017
Look, you're a nurse, right?

522
00:45:38.197 --> 00:45:42.597
No. No, that was Donnie's dream.
I couldn't stand the blood.

523
00:45:42.897 --> 00:45:44.097
I teach the third grade.

524
00:45:44.697 --> 00:45:46.297
-Please.
-Look, you should go.

525
00:45:46.497 --> 00:45:47.498
Please.

526
00:45:47.798 --> 00:45:48.898
Please?

527
00:45:49.198 --> 00:45:51.098
I didn't do whatever they said I did.

528
00:45:51.798 --> 00:45:52.798
I swear.

529
00:45:53.298 --> 00:45:55.398
I'm in some bad trouble
and I need some help.

530
00:45:55.598 --> 00:45:57.998
I wouldn't have come all the way here
to lie to you.

531
00:46:01.598 --> 00:46:04.198
You still figuring on shooting me?

532
00:46:04.398 --> 00:46:07.099
Only that shotgun's a little long
to bring up fast.

533
00:46:07.399 --> 00:46:10.299
Look, if you're going to do it,
just get it over with.

534
00:46:10.599 --> 00:46:12.399
I ain't got nowhere else to go.

535
00:46:15.799 --> 00:46:19.299
Pull the truck in the garage.
The neighbours'll be up in a minute.

536
00:46:19.599 --> 00:46:21.099
You'd best call me Sarah.

537
00:46:21.199 --> 00:46:22.399
All right.

538
00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:39.800
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

539
00:47:08.602 --> 00:47:09.602
Hello?

540
00:47:09.802 --> 00:47:11.678
<i>This is 911. We received a hang-up
from this location.</i>

541
00:47:11.702 --> 00:47:14.102
Yeah, neighbour's dog knocked over
the trash cans

542
00:47:14.302 --> 00:47:16.702
and scared the hell out of me.
Everything's fine. Thanks.

543
00:47:16.902 --> 00:47:17.902
<i>Okay, then.</i>

544
00:47:24.003 --> 00:47:27.003
Seems you call the police and hang up
without saying anything,

545
00:47:27.203 --> 00:47:29.203
they call you back right away.

546
00:47:35.603 --> 00:47:37.904
I should've come
and seen you in person.

547
00:47:41.004 --> 00:47:43.204
Before. I mean, then.

548
00:47:43.404 --> 00:47:44.804
Yeah, I read the letter.

549
00:47:46.804 --> 00:47:48.104
It was okay.

550
00:47:50.304 --> 00:47:52.404
And once a year I got the flowers.

551
00:47:55.004 --> 00:47:56.505
You don't look real good.

552
00:47:57.905 --> 00:48:01.605
I'm supposed to be dead.
Been a long night.

553
00:48:01.905 --> 00:48:03.705
Why aren't you?

554
00:48:03.905 --> 00:48:06.205
Well, the U.S. Government spent
a lot of time and money

555
00:48:06.405 --> 00:48:08.105
teaching me how not to die

556
00:48:08.305 --> 00:48:10.705
after they got done teaching me
how to kill people.

557
00:48:12.205 --> 00:48:14.405
So how is it I'm supposed to help you?

558
00:48:15.806 --> 00:48:19.806
You can do a running cross-stitch,
finish it with an embroidery knot?

559
00:48:20.106 --> 00:48:21.206
Yeah.

560
00:48:31.006 --> 00:48:32.906
You got to try to spread it out.

561
00:48:33.106 --> 00:48:35.407
It's gonna look odd
you buy it all in one place.

562
00:48:43.907 --> 00:48:46.607
How can it be three years ago
when it seems like ten?

563
00:48:50.607 --> 00:48:52.108
Mileage can be rough.

564
00:49:03.608 --> 00:49:05.308
No one ever beats me in.

565
00:49:12.709 --> 00:49:13.909
You never left.

566
00:49:14.909 --> 00:49:16.909
Everyone keeps telling me I'm crazy.

567
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:20.109
Like I didn't see what I saw,
or heard what I heard.

568
00:49:21.409 --> 00:49:23.709
I'm not crazy, though.
You think I'm crazy?

569
00:49:25.209 --> 00:49:27.209
Where did all this stuff come from?

570
00:49:28.109 --> 00:49:31.010
At first I thought
it was Washington, Quantico.

571
00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:35.010
I checked and it didn't.
It just magically arrived.

572
00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:39.510
Cooperating agencies, ATF, NRO,
places that don't even have initials

573
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:42.410
they cooperate
in times of national emergency.

574
00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:44.290
You need to get some sleep.

575
00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:47.011
You know that the first
ballistics diagram got here

576
00:49:47.211 --> 00:49:48.911
22 minutes after the shooting.

577
00:49:49.211 --> 00:49:50.211
We're good at our jobs.

578
00:49:50.411 --> 00:49:52.887
12 minutes after the shooting,
they were still scrambling choppers.

579
00:49:52.911 --> 00:49:54.011
The scene was locked down.

580
00:49:55.411 --> 00:49:58.511
How did they get a reverse azimuth
10 minutes after that?

581
00:49:58.711 --> 00:49:59.987
I mean, we work
for the federal government.

582
00:50:00.011 --> 00:50:01.291
We're not that good at our jobs.

583
00:50:02.211 --> 00:50:03.787
<i>-You want to see something?
-Probably not.</i>

584
00:50:03.811 --> 00:50:05.111
<i>I downloaded this.</i>

585
00:50:05.311 --> 00:50:06.472
<i>This is a full-scale printout</i>

586
00:50:06.512 --> 00:50:09.412
of a target Swagger shot
two years ago at 1,000 yards.

587
00:50:09.712 --> 00:50:12.812
I punched in the holes myself.
It was at a competition.

588
00:50:13.012 --> 00:50:17.612
I read an article. It said Swagger shot
a silver dollar at a grand.

589
00:50:17.912 --> 00:50:19.012
Five shots,

590
00:50:19.412 --> 00:50:20.612
at 1,000 yards,

591
00:50:20.812 --> 00:50:23.012
an inch-and-a-half spread.
An inch and a half!

592
00:50:25.513 --> 00:50:27.089
<i>It was the capital of the United States...</i>

593
00:50:27.113 --> 00:50:30.513
That's the flag behind the President.
It's barely waving.

594
00:50:30.713 --> 00:50:32.153
<i>This is the wind speed and direction</i>

595
00:50:32.313 --> 00:50:33.589
<i>according to the
National Weather Service</i>

596
00:50:33.613 --> 00:50:35.813
<i>at the time of the shot. I did the math.</i>

597
00:50:36.013 --> 00:50:38.513
Now, how does a man who can do that

598
00:50:39.513 --> 00:50:42.614
miss by two-and-a-half feet
at 2,000 yards?

599
00:50:43.414 --> 00:50:44.414
<i>I don't get it.</i>

600
00:50:44.714 --> 00:50:47.314
You've had a long night.
Let it go and get some sleep.

601
00:50:47.614 --> 00:50:49.614
You know, I saw Timmons interviewed.

602
00:50:49.814 --> 00:50:51.914
He said he was walking foot patrol,

603
00:50:52.214 --> 00:50:54.614
saw a rifle barrel
sticking out of a window,

604
00:50:54.914 --> 00:50:57.514
went upstairs to investigate,
and shot Swagger.

605
00:50:57.814 --> 00:50:59.614
No sniper sticks his rifle
out of a window.

606
00:50:59.814 --> 00:51:02.415
They shoot from cover,
back in the room.

607
00:51:02.915 --> 00:51:04.715
It doesn't make any sense.

608
00:51:07.115 --> 00:51:08.891
-I'm gonna talk to Timmons.
-No, you're not.

609
00:51:08.915 --> 00:51:10.915
Why? 'Cause they're gonna fire me
if I do?

610
00:51:11.815 --> 00:51:14.415
Timmons was killed by a mugger
in an alley last night.

611
00:51:18.815 --> 00:51:20.816
In a conspiracy,
all loose ends are trimmed.

612
00:51:21.416 --> 00:51:23.216
Jack Ruby shoots Oswald?

613
00:51:23.416 --> 00:51:25.316
Bad things happen to good people.

614
00:51:25.516 --> 00:51:26.836
Yeah, not that quick, they don't.

615
00:51:32.616 --> 00:51:34.916
Well, I stopped the bleeding
temporarily.

616
00:51:35.916 --> 00:51:38.017
But it'll cut loose again.

617
00:51:41.617 --> 00:51:44.217
Cut out and scrub away
anything that's dead,

618
00:51:44.517 --> 00:51:47.217
working your way out,
sewing it together

619
00:51:47.517 --> 00:51:50.217
and you got to try to make sure
you don't re-infect it.

620
00:51:52.717 --> 00:51:54.117
You ready for this?

621
00:51:56.418 --> 00:51:59.018
I'm going to do all those Whip-It!'s
and pass out.

622
00:52:02.418 --> 00:52:03.718
Good luck, okay?

623
00:53:17.722 --> 00:53:21.022
<i>I need you to plan
a presidential assassination.</i>

624
00:53:21.222 --> 00:53:22.522
<i>That our guy in the collar?</i>

625
00:53:22.822 --> 00:53:23.922
<i>Whose president?</i>

626
00:53:24.022 --> 00:53:25.422
<i>I didn't say "execute".</i>

627
00:53:25.622 --> 00:53:28.323
<i>He's getting a medal. Know it?</i>

628
00:53:28.623 --> 00:53:30.723
<i>The Archbishop of Ethiopia.</i>

629
00:53:35.223 --> 00:53:36.623
<i>You need to find the shooter.</i>

630
00:53:40.023 --> 00:53:41.023
No.

631
00:55:34.329 --> 00:55:36.829
Two-and-a-half days, shot twice,
no sign?

632
00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:38.430
Find me something.

633
00:55:38.530 --> 00:55:40.630
Maybe he crawled into a hole and died.

634
00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:43.630
He's not dead.

635
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:46.830
Tear apart his life.

636
00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:48.330
Again.

637
00:55:53.530 --> 00:55:54.530
Go okay?

638
00:55:59.931 --> 00:56:01.231
I've been hallucinating.

639
00:56:04.331 --> 00:56:06.131
Something I need to tell you.

640
00:56:09.431 --> 00:56:11.231
Ralphie's dead.

641
00:56:11.431 --> 00:56:12.631
Who's Ralphie?

642
00:56:13.631 --> 00:56:15.032
Well, they said you shot your dog

643
00:56:15.232 --> 00:56:17.032
'cause you knew
you weren't coming back.

644
00:56:17.332 --> 00:56:18.732
They said that, huh?

645
00:56:23.132 --> 00:56:24.532
Name was Sam.

646
00:56:25.632 --> 00:56:28.032
He was a good dog.
I raised him from a pup.

647
00:56:32.232 --> 00:56:33.333
You okay?

648
00:56:35.333 --> 00:56:36.333
No.

649
00:56:37.533 --> 00:56:39.133
What are you gonna do?

650
00:56:40.733 --> 00:56:42.333
I'll get better.

651
00:56:44.233 --> 00:56:46.633
Then I'm going to burn
their playhouse down.

652
00:57:22.635 --> 00:57:23.735
Can I help you?

653
00:57:52.737 --> 00:57:53.737
Hold still.

654
00:58:05.438 --> 00:58:07.238
I been meaning to ask you.

655
00:58:08.038 --> 00:58:09.638
You have a boyfriend?

656
00:58:11.838 --> 00:58:12.838
Why?

657
00:58:14.038 --> 00:58:16.538
Am I still supposed to be
the grieving widow?

658
00:58:16.738 --> 00:58:18.238
It's been three years.

659
00:58:18.338 --> 00:58:19.338
No.

660
00:58:20.038 --> 00:58:21.614
Just wonder if I'm gonna have
to shoot somebody

661
00:58:21.638 --> 00:58:22.814
walks through that door
without knocking,

662
00:58:22.838 --> 00:58:24.639
wondering where you've been.

663
00:58:27.039 --> 00:58:28.539
Well, no.

664
00:58:28.739 --> 00:58:30.939
Nothing steady. No boyfriend.

665
00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:56.740
Not bad.

666
00:58:58.040 --> 00:58:59.640
A little stiff, but...

667
00:59:01.441 --> 00:59:02.541
Hey.

668
00:59:03.741 --> 00:59:06.241
You know, you would've made
one hell of a nurse.

669
00:59:07.641 --> 00:59:09.441
That was really brave, what you did.

670
00:59:09.941 --> 00:59:11.041
You saved my life.

671
00:59:15.141 --> 00:59:17.641
I'm better. I better get to it.

672
00:59:17.841 --> 00:59:20.042
They're never gonna stop chasing you.

673
00:59:21.242 --> 00:59:22.342
Never.

674
00:59:23.642 --> 00:59:25.642
They're never gonna stop looking.

675
00:59:27.742 --> 00:59:30.842
{\an8}In the meantime,
they need someone else to find.

676
00:59:31.042 --> 00:59:32.442
I'm going to give them him.

677
00:59:32.742 --> 00:59:34.042
Excuse me?

678
00:59:35.242 --> 00:59:38.243
May be a way to get two birds
with that stone, too.

679
00:59:46.943 --> 00:59:48.743
-Swagger?
-Hey.

680
00:59:58.544 --> 01:00:01.144
The gun Donnie learned to hunt with
when he was a kid.

681
01:00:03.044 --> 01:00:06.344
It ain't much, but it shoots true.

682
01:00:06.644 --> 01:00:08.944
I cleaned and oiled it
before I put it away.

683
01:00:09.144 --> 01:00:10.144
You sure?

684
01:00:11.444 --> 01:00:12.544
Yeah.

685
01:00:16.745 --> 01:00:18.045
Why'd you go?

686
01:00:18.845 --> 01:00:20.545
When they came to see you.

687
01:00:22.945 --> 01:00:25.045
They know which buttons to press.

688
01:00:26.045 --> 01:00:28.221
I'm still enough of a sucker,
you press that patriot button,

689
01:00:28.245 --> 01:00:31.645
I'll sit up in my chair and say,
"Which way you want me to go, boss?"

690
01:00:31.945 --> 01:00:35.346
I mean, I ain't real proud of it,
but I ain't ashamed, either.

691
01:00:36.946 --> 01:00:38.246
You know, I got a plan,

692
01:00:39.646 --> 01:00:41.846
but I think I'm going to need your help.

693
01:00:42.146 --> 01:00:43.946
Okay. I'll do it.

694
01:00:44.746 --> 01:00:46.946
I haven't even told you what it is yet.

695
01:00:47.746 --> 01:00:48.746
I know.

696
01:00:56.647 --> 01:00:57.747
Look.

697
01:00:58.847 --> 01:01:00.147
It was my fault.

698
01:01:02.947 --> 01:01:03.947
What?

699
01:01:07.447 --> 01:01:09.548
You know, with Donnie.
I should never have...

700
01:01:16.648 --> 01:01:17.648
What?

701
01:01:22.848 --> 01:01:24.448
Don't you dare.

702
01:01:26.548 --> 01:01:29.449
Don't you try and take that
away from him.

703
01:01:30.649 --> 01:01:34.249
He knew exactly what he was doing
when he enlisted.

704
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:35.625
He knew exactly what he was doing

705
01:01:35.649 --> 01:01:38.349
when he enrolled
in scout sniper training.

706
01:01:40.149 --> 01:01:42.049
He loved what he did.

707
01:01:42.249 --> 01:01:44.149
No one made him do it.

708
01:01:46.650 --> 01:01:48.650
That ain't yours to carry.

709
01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:53.250
You're right.

710
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:56.250
I'm sorry I tried.

711
01:02:22.251 --> 01:02:23.452
It's okay.

712
01:02:29.452 --> 01:02:31.652
<i>I need you to meet with this FBI agent.</i>

713
01:02:31.852 --> 01:02:34.452
<i>Use him to flush Johnson
out of his hiding place.</i>

714
01:02:34.752 --> 01:02:38.552
<i>Give him the vehicle ID number.
He'll do what he's trained to do.</i>

715
01:02:38.852 --> 01:02:41.153
<i>You get in and get out.
Don't get caught.</i>

716
01:02:41.653 --> 01:02:43.153
<i>You get caught, I get caught.</i>

717
01:02:43.353 --> 01:02:44.853
You know what that is?

718
01:02:46.653 --> 01:02:49.253
Says he didn't shoot no one,
but I don't know.

719
01:02:49.453 --> 01:02:50.733
Well, he's been staying with me.

720
01:02:50.953 --> 01:02:52.853
Who's been staying with you?
Bob Lee Swagger?

721
01:03:01.654 --> 01:03:05.454
The plates are probably fake.
Pretty sure the other number's real.

722
01:03:05.754 --> 01:03:07.254
-And what is this?
-A VIN number.

723
01:03:07.554 --> 01:03:10.554
Seems no one goes through
the trouble to change them anymore.

724
01:03:11.854 --> 01:03:14.654
And you're going to sit real still
until I'm long gone.

725
01:03:46.556 --> 01:03:47.876
See the guy in the Eagles jacket?

726
01:04:13.458 --> 01:04:15.258
Excuse me, sir.
Can I see some ID, please?

727
01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:24.658
Sir, I'm going to need you
to take off your hat

728
01:04:24.958 --> 01:04:25.958
and show me some ID.

729
01:04:30.158 --> 01:04:31.659
I'm not gonna ask you again.

730
01:04:33.259 --> 01:04:34.959
Take your hat off, asshole!

731
01:04:44.059 --> 01:04:46.759
Get on the ground!
Get your ass on the ground!

732
01:05:20.261 --> 01:05:21.461
Hey, how's it going?

733
01:05:23.261 --> 01:05:24.461
Hey, John.

734
01:05:48.063 --> 01:05:49.163
-Hey, Ed?
-Yeah.

735
01:05:49.363 --> 01:05:51.163
You got that Stevens file
we wanted back?

736
01:05:53.763 --> 01:05:56.763
How badly do you want to know?
Because this will get you fired.

737
01:05:57.263 --> 01:06:02.663
Well, I have to go before
the Office of Professional Responsibility

738
01:06:03.063 --> 01:06:04.864
in 45 minutes for a review.

739
01:06:05.164 --> 01:06:08.064
I'm gonna get fired anyway.
I'm done worrying about that.

740
01:06:09.364 --> 01:06:11.264
What do you think?

741
01:06:12.064 --> 01:06:14.364
I think that CNN got the tapes
before we did,

742
01:06:14.564 --> 01:06:16.764
already edited together
to show the angles.

743
01:06:17.064 --> 01:06:18.064
Who delivered them?

744
01:06:18.264 --> 01:06:21.464
An unnamed agency
who will never confirm or deny.

745
01:06:21.764 --> 01:06:23.665
They denied, which is a...

746
01:06:26.265 --> 01:06:29.365
Which is a confirmation of sorts.

747
01:06:29.565 --> 01:06:31.265
Of what?

748
01:06:31.465 --> 01:06:34.865
That you are asking questions
way outside your pay grade.

749
01:06:35.265 --> 01:06:36.305
Oh, come on, just tell me.

750
01:06:36.365 --> 01:06:38.005
You don't want to be here
for that review.

751
01:06:38.065 --> 01:06:41.466
They don't have to stop at firing you.
They can charge you and hold you.

752
01:06:50.466 --> 01:06:53.966
The ASAC's job
comes with Delta clearance.

753
01:06:57.166 --> 01:06:58.466
-Thank you.
-Go.

754
01:07:05.667 --> 01:07:07.567
This is a copy of a chat room transcript.

755
01:07:07.767 --> 01:07:10.767
These guys talk about everything.
I didn't give it much thought at the time.

756
01:07:10.967 --> 01:07:13.267
We just traced it to a doughnut shop
with free WiFi.

757
01:07:13.567 --> 01:07:16.167
But this,
this is a Delta-level clearance request

758
01:07:16.367 --> 01:07:19.068
out of the FBI field office in Philadelphia
seven minutes ago.

759
01:07:19.368 --> 01:07:21.768
Funny thing,
Google Maps puts the doughnut shop

760
01:07:22.068 --> 01:07:24.468
only three blocks away
from the field office.

761
01:07:24.668 --> 01:07:27.568
There's only one guy who met
with Swagger before he disappeared.

762
01:07:27.768 --> 01:07:28.968
He lives in Philly.

763
01:07:29.268 --> 01:07:30.668
And he works for the FBI.

764
01:07:31.968 --> 01:07:33.268
Nicholas Memphis.

765
01:07:33.768 --> 01:07:37.069
...really strange company.
Contracts with a lot of the Fortune 500.

766
01:07:37.369 --> 01:07:39.969
Offices in Virginia, Delaware,
registered in Panama.

767
01:07:40.269 --> 01:07:41.989
They own a boat
that's flagged out of Libya.

768
01:07:42.169 --> 01:07:43.245
<i>They're definitely not government,</i>

769
01:07:43.269 --> 01:07:45.869
<i>but they have high ex-military contacts
like you wouldn't believe.</i>

770
01:07:46.169 --> 01:07:47.269
<i>These are contractors.</i>

771
01:07:47.369 --> 01:07:49.769
<i>I can't tell
what this company does, but...</i>

772
01:07:51.569 --> 01:07:52.669
Hey.

773
01:07:52.769 --> 01:07:53.869
Hey, hey, hey!

774
01:07:58.870 --> 01:07:59.870
<i>Memphis?</i>

775
01:08:00.070 --> 01:08:01.070
<i>Memphis!</i>

776
01:08:08.370 --> 01:08:10.070
For a man who didn't know much,

777
01:08:10.270 --> 01:08:13.371
you sure took a long,
painful time to tell it.

778
01:08:13.671 --> 01:08:15.271
Get him some water.

779
01:08:24.371 --> 01:08:25.471
Good.

780
01:08:36.072 --> 01:08:37.172
Got to pee yet?

781
01:08:37.472 --> 01:08:39.172
Got to flush them drugs
out of your system.

782
01:08:39.272 --> 01:08:41.553
Look awful suspicious
if you were to go and shoot yourself

783
01:08:41.772 --> 01:08:43.872
pumped full of the same shit
the agency uses.

784
01:08:44.072 --> 01:08:45.972
I'm not going to shoot myself.

785
01:08:46.872 --> 01:08:47.872
Sure you will.

786
01:08:48.972 --> 01:08:50.373
Take him out. Get him ready.

787
01:08:50.573 --> 01:08:51.573
No!

788
01:08:57.273 --> 01:08:58.373
That's my gun.

789
01:08:58.473 --> 01:08:59.573
Yeah.

790
01:09:00.073 --> 01:09:02.373
You wrote a real touching
suicide note, too.

791
01:09:02.673 --> 01:09:04.873
All overwrought with guilt
about your mistakes.

792
01:09:12.074 --> 01:09:13.474
Quit your struggling.

793
01:09:17.174 --> 01:09:20.774
This thing works.
It's not the first time we've used it.

794
01:09:25.374 --> 01:09:27.075
Russo. Russo!

795
01:09:27.275 --> 01:09:28.875
Davis, get out here!

796
01:09:33.775 --> 01:09:35.775
What is the goddamn hold-up?

797
01:10:13.477 --> 01:10:16.577
Don't kill me, please!
Don't kill me! I believe you!

798
01:10:16.777 --> 01:10:17.777
Kill you?

799
01:10:17.977 --> 01:10:20.577
Had enough chances.
I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.

800
01:10:21.778 --> 01:10:24.478
What kind of asshole'd
think up a thing like this?

801
01:10:32.878 --> 01:10:35.978
Not bad with a poodle shooter
and a makeshift silencer, huh?

802
01:10:37.478 --> 01:10:39.478
Help me toss these boys in the water?

803
01:10:39.678 --> 01:10:41.879
You set me up and you used me as bait!

804
01:10:42.179 --> 01:10:44.779
You think? Flushed them out, didn't it?

805
01:10:45.079 --> 01:10:45.979
I was kind of hoping to keep one alive,

806
01:10:46.079 --> 01:10:48.079
but they were
kind of determined to kill you.

807
01:10:48.379 --> 01:10:50.479
You can hire a good lawyer,
and I'll call the Bureau.

808
01:10:50.679 --> 01:10:52.479
They can work out some kind of deal.

809
01:10:53.579 --> 01:10:56.419
This is explainable. You can prove
that you didn't shoot the Archbishop.

810
01:10:56.479 --> 01:10:57.639
I don't think you understand.

811
01:10:57.779 --> 01:10:58.880
These boys killed my dog.

812
01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:04.780
Hey, this is the 21st century.
You can't go to war with these people.

813
01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:06.480
In the end, the law is all...

814
01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:09.180
In the end,
the law'll never catch and hold them.

815
01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:10.756
In a year or two,
they'll be back in business.

816
01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:13.180
New names, new messenger boys,
same old story.

817
01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:14.580
And I'll be dead.

818
01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:16.680
It's gonna be
some hard, hairy work, Pork.

819
01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:19.057
There's gonna be more shooting,
and more people are gonna die.

820
01:11:19.081 --> 01:11:22.181
Now, I didn't start it, but be sure as hell
I mean to see it through.

821
01:11:22.381 --> 01:11:24.781
So you get it straight. You in or you out?

822
01:11:28.181 --> 01:11:29.541
You know, I missed a meeting today

823
01:11:29.681 --> 01:11:32.981
where I was going to get fired
for unprofessional conduct

824
01:11:33.181 --> 01:11:35.982
because I was kidnapped by people
that don't exist.

825
01:11:40.882 --> 01:11:42.182
I'll take his legs.

826
01:11:42.382 --> 01:11:43.782
It's a good call, Pork.

827
01:11:44.582 --> 01:11:47.282
You're trying to tell me
a rookie FBI agent

828
01:11:47.482 --> 01:11:49.082
overpowered and killed
the three of them?

829
01:11:49.282 --> 01:11:50.382
No.

830
01:11:51.082 --> 01:11:54.883
They were shot from a distance
of about 200 yards.

831
01:11:56.883 --> 01:11:58.083
With a.22.

832
01:12:00.083 --> 01:12:02.183
-Swagger's alive.
-Yes.

833
01:12:02.383 --> 01:12:03.783
And that young kid,

834
01:12:04.183 --> 01:12:05.683
FBI Agent

835
01:12:08.183 --> 01:12:09.383
Nick Memphis,

836
01:12:09.483 --> 01:12:13.084
who managed to pry out
a Delta-level clearance,

837
01:12:13.384 --> 01:12:16.984
hasn't come back to the office
and is out there with him.

838
01:12:19.284 --> 01:12:20.284
What?

839
01:12:20.384 --> 01:12:22.484
I just went over
Swagger's financials again.

840
01:12:22.984 --> 01:12:26.484
Once a year, he sent flowers
to someone with his Visa card.

841
01:12:26.784 --> 01:12:29.084
I cracked the FTD database,
got an address.

842
01:12:29.284 --> 01:12:32.385
Donnie Fenn's widow.
Anniversary of his death.

843
01:12:32.685 --> 01:12:33.861
She went back to using
her maiden name,

844
01:12:33.885 --> 01:12:36.085
which is why we missed it the first time.

845
01:12:37.385 --> 01:12:39.161
She's maybe the only person
in the entire world

846
01:12:39.185 --> 01:12:41.225
that would believe anything
that Swagger had to say.

847
01:12:41.385 --> 01:12:44.585
Look. Keene City, Kentucky.

848
01:12:44.885 --> 01:12:46.485
It's just within driving range.

849
01:12:47.485 --> 01:12:50.086
-What are you waiting for? Take the jet.
-All right.

850
01:12:57.986 --> 01:12:59.586
We've given Swagger a new war,

851
01:13:00.186 --> 01:13:01.586
he's found a new spotter.

852
01:13:02.986 --> 01:13:04.486
This is about to get worse.

853
01:13:33.688 --> 01:13:35.288
I think we're here.

854
01:13:36.488 --> 01:13:37.588
Hey. Swagger.

855
01:13:42.088 --> 01:13:43.488
I think we're here.

856
01:13:46.689 --> 01:13:48.689
Welcome to Tennessee.

857
01:13:48.889 --> 01:13:50.889
Patron state of shooting stuff.

858
01:13:53.289 --> 01:13:54.689
Hey, who is this guy?

859
01:13:54.789 --> 01:13:58.189
This guy was the greatest gunsmith
east of the Mississippi. He's a legend.

860
01:13:58.489 --> 01:14:00.609
He knows more about guns
and the people who shoot them

861
01:14:00.689 --> 01:14:01.689
than Smith & Wesson.

862
01:14:01.789 --> 01:14:04.366
Don't really matter anymore. He knew
we were coming the last three miles.

863
01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:05.666
-You mind your manners.
-All right.

864
01:14:05.690 --> 01:14:09.090
You boys come a long way.
What you looking for?

865
01:14:09.490 --> 01:14:10.590
Wisdom.

866
01:14:12.690 --> 01:14:14.290
You come to the wrong place.

867
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:15.590
Maybe.

868
01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:17.566
Say a man wanted to fire a bullet
from one rifle

869
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:19.090
and have it match exactly to another.

870
01:14:19.190 --> 01:14:20.590
Could that be done?

871
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:21.791
Take a seat.

872
01:14:22.691 --> 01:14:23.791
Have a chair, son.

873
01:14:28.191 --> 01:14:31.891
If you could get a bullet that had been
shot clean through the first rifle,

874
01:14:32.291 --> 01:14:33.691
could make the grooves match.

875
01:14:33.791 --> 01:14:35.991
Kind of thing ain't been done
in a long time, though.

876
01:14:36.291 --> 01:14:37.867
The bullet that was taken
out of the Archbishop

877
01:14:37.891 --> 01:14:39.391
was completely mangled on impact.

878
01:14:39.591 --> 01:14:41.692
FBI match was metallurgical.

879
01:14:41.992 --> 01:14:42.992
Thank you, Mother.

880
01:14:43.192 --> 01:14:45.668
Yeah, but you couldn't guarantee that
going in, so they had to be sure.

881
01:14:45.692 --> 01:14:47.992
And I still can't figure out
how they could be.

882
01:14:51.092 --> 01:14:52.592
-Good coffee?
-Yep.

883
01:14:54.692 --> 01:14:57.692
Look on your left, there.
Second shelf down.

884
01:14:58.693 --> 01:15:00.793
Red leather spine.

885
01:15:01.093 --> 01:15:03.893
Written by a guy named Schofeld.

886
01:15:05.193 --> 01:15:08.893
Put it there 15 years ago.
Don't figure it's moved since then.

887
01:15:28.794 --> 01:15:30.894
Yeah. Paper patching.

888
01:15:31.194 --> 01:15:34.194
State of the art. 1870s Africa.

889
01:15:34.394 --> 01:15:35.495
Paper-wrapped bullet.

890
01:15:35.795 --> 01:15:38.095
No metal on metal
going down the barrel.

891
01:15:38.395 --> 01:15:41.295
Grooves would match.
Paper unwinds at the muzzle.

892
01:15:41.495 --> 01:15:43.395
Leaves no traces when it hits.

893
01:15:43.695 --> 01:15:47.095
Interesting question, though.
Hope I satisfied you.

894
01:15:47.295 --> 01:15:48.495
I got another one.

895
01:15:49.395 --> 01:15:50.395
I thought you might.

896
01:15:50.595 --> 01:15:53.395
Suppose I was looking for a man
to make a 2,200-yard cold-bore shot.

897
01:15:53.696 --> 01:15:55.296
Who's alive that could do that?

898
01:15:55.896 --> 01:15:59.896
Seems I heard about a shot like that
being made not too long ago.

899
01:16:00.196 --> 01:16:03.196
Said the guy's name
was Bob Lee Swagger.

900
01:16:03.396 --> 01:16:05.496
Never met the man,
so I wouldn't know him.

901
01:16:05.696 --> 01:16:07.096
Yeah, they said that, all right.

902
01:16:07.196 --> 01:16:10.796
They also said
that artificial sweeteners were safe,

903
01:16:11.896 --> 01:16:14.397
and WMDs were in Iraq,

904
01:16:14.697 --> 01:16:17.197
and Anna Nicole married for love!

905
01:16:19.197 --> 01:16:20.997
Would've been
a bad job to take, though.

906
01:16:21.197 --> 01:16:22.197
How come?

907
01:16:22.397 --> 01:16:24.897
Whoever took that shot's
probably dead now.

908
01:16:25.097 --> 01:16:26.897
That's how a conspiracy works.

909
01:16:27.097 --> 01:16:30.598
Them boys on the grassy knoll,
they were dead within three hours.

910
01:16:30.798 --> 01:16:34.598
Buried in the damn desert.
Unmarked graves out past Terlingua.

911
01:16:34.898 --> 01:16:36.198
And you know this for a fact?

912
01:16:36.398 --> 01:16:37.998
Still got the shovel.

913
01:16:40.298 --> 01:16:42.098
Sake of argument,
somebody other than him?

914
01:16:42.298 --> 01:16:43.698
There was a guy in Russia.

915
01:16:43.898 --> 01:16:45.498
They locked his ass up.

916
01:16:46.298 --> 01:16:48.899
Another one in France.
I know he's dead.

917
01:16:49.999 --> 01:16:51.699
There was one guy,

918
01:16:51.899 --> 01:16:54.099
but he don't shoot no more.

919
01:16:54.599 --> 01:16:57.199
A brutal son of a bitch.

920
01:16:57.399 --> 01:17:00.399
Most boys shoot to kill.
He'd shoot to wound,

921
01:17:01.299 --> 01:17:02.899
wait till his friends come to help,

922
01:17:03.299 --> 01:17:04.499
kill them too.

923
01:17:04.699 --> 01:17:06.699
Turned one target into four.

924
01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:11.100
Men, women, children.
Killed them by the hundreds.

925
01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:13.600
The other side wanted him. Bad.

926
01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:18.900
Finally narrowed his hide down
to an abandoned six-storey building.

927
01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:22.100
They quit the subtle tactics.

928
01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:24.900
They called in an artillery strike.

929
01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:26.901
Levelled a square block.

930
01:17:27.101 --> 01:17:29.101
Brought the building down on his ass.

931
01:17:29.401 --> 01:17:31.701
Some say he crawled out of there.

932
01:17:31.901 --> 01:17:33.501
Some say he died.

933
01:17:33.801 --> 01:17:35.601
Never heard from him no more.

934
01:17:36.401 --> 01:17:37.701
Fuck me.

935
01:17:38.001 --> 01:17:39.001
What?

936
01:17:39.101 --> 01:17:40.501
I met the son of a bitch.

937
01:17:45.002 --> 01:17:47.902
Yeah. The world ain't what it seems,
is it, Gunnie?

938
01:17:49.002 --> 01:17:50.102
No, sir.

939
01:17:50.302 --> 01:17:51.802
You keep that in mind.

940
01:17:51.902 --> 01:17:53.702
The moment you think you got it figured,

941
01:17:53.902 --> 01:17:54.902
you're wrong.

942
01:17:58.902 --> 01:17:59.902
He got a name?

943
01:18:05.503 --> 01:18:06.903
<i>Hey, it's me, Nick.</i>

944
01:18:07.003 --> 01:18:09.803
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in?

945
01:18:10.703 --> 01:18:12.603
-Yeah.
<i>-Are you okay? Nick, where are you?</i>

946
01:18:12.803 --> 01:18:14.003
It's better I don't tell you.

947
01:18:14.903 --> 01:18:17.203
Look, do you have a pen?

948
01:18:17.403 --> 01:18:19.603
<i>I need you to find someone.
Mikhaylo Sczerbiak.</i>

949
01:18:19.903 --> 01:18:20.903
-Yeah.
<i>-You got it?</i>

950
01:18:21.004 --> 01:18:22.004
I got it.

951
01:18:22.204 --> 01:18:23.904
Man, this is hard to spell.

952
01:18:30.204 --> 01:18:33.204
Swagger is going to go
with what he knows.

953
01:18:33.404 --> 01:18:35.604
He'll try to track the shooter.

954
01:18:35.804 --> 01:18:37.304
He won't get far that way.

955
01:18:37.504 --> 01:18:38.904
Yes, he will.

956
01:18:39.104 --> 01:18:41.105
-How's that?
-We're going to help him.

957
01:18:41.205 --> 01:18:44.105
Sometimes to catch a wolf,
you need to tie the bait to a tree.

958
01:18:51.505 --> 01:18:53.105
And what happens to the bait?

959
01:18:54.705 --> 01:18:56.005
Hard to say.

960
01:18:57.105 --> 01:18:59.606
But that's the nature of being the bait.

961
01:19:12.706 --> 01:19:15.006
<i>-Hey, it's Nick. Did you find him?</i>
-He's in Virginia.

962
01:19:16.206 --> 01:19:18.207
An end we thought was tied up

963
01:19:18.507 --> 01:19:19.607
came untied.

964
01:19:20.607 --> 01:19:22.207
Meaning, Colonel?

965
01:19:22.307 --> 01:19:24.007
Swagger is still alive.

966
01:19:27.607 --> 01:19:28.807
Oh, my.

967
01:19:29.607 --> 01:19:34.007
I need to land a transport plane
without a customs check.

968
01:19:35.908 --> 01:19:39.408
I'm certain I don't want to know,
but what's on the plane?

969
01:19:41.308 --> 01:19:43.008
Crew we used in Ethiopia.

970
01:19:43.208 --> 01:19:46.108
Twenty-four good, hard men.

971
01:19:46.308 --> 01:19:48.308
Weapons and gear.

972
01:19:48.508 --> 01:19:50.008
Only 24?

973
01:19:51.508 --> 01:19:52.808
Do kill him.

974
01:19:54.609 --> 01:19:56.509
No loose ends this time.

975
01:19:57.509 --> 01:19:58.909
Night, Colonel.

976
01:20:00.409 --> 01:20:01.509
Good night, Senator.

977
01:20:20.410 --> 01:20:21.410
Hello?

978
01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:25.010
Someone there?

979
01:21:01.412 --> 01:21:02.412
Now look.

980
01:21:03.112 --> 01:21:04.912
Look what you've done now.

981
01:21:08.313 --> 01:21:09.613
Give me that.

982
01:21:09.813 --> 01:21:12.613
I don't want you to hurt yourself. Okay?

983
01:21:21.313 --> 01:21:23.113
Where's your boyfriend?

984
01:21:25.414 --> 01:21:26.914
{\an8}What if it's a trap?

985
01:21:27.314 --> 01:21:28.714
Oh, it's a trap.

986
01:21:28.914 --> 01:21:31.114
Guaranteed. Every time.

987
01:21:33.114 --> 01:21:34.714
Question is, for whom?

988
01:21:36.314 --> 01:21:38.014
-You got your list, right?
-Yep.

989
01:21:38.214 --> 01:21:40.414
All right, you make sure you stick to it.

990
01:22:08.516 --> 01:22:09.516
Let's go.

991
01:22:15.016 --> 01:22:16.916
Okay, so what are these for again?

992
01:22:17.716 --> 01:22:19.416
Tear gas is going to be on my remote.

993
01:22:19.616 --> 01:22:21.117
Right.

994
01:22:21.217 --> 01:22:25.217
Napalm on the first floor.
Pipe bombs on the rest of them.

995
01:22:25.517 --> 01:22:29.417
Gotta be very careful with these.
It's got a 15-foot kill radius.

996
01:22:29.717 --> 01:22:31.817
So what exactly
are we getting ready for?

997
01:22:32.017 --> 01:22:33.317
For as much as we can be.

998
01:22:46.618 --> 01:22:48.718
All right, you got
four enemy combatants.

999
01:22:48.918 --> 01:22:50.518
Take them one by one.

1000
01:22:50.718 --> 01:22:52.558
Keep shooting.
Don't let anything distract you.

1001
01:23:01.319 --> 01:23:02.319
Fuck!

1002
01:23:04.619 --> 01:23:06.919
Didn't I say
don't let anything distract you?

1003
01:23:07.219 --> 01:23:09.519
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.
Let's see it.

1004
01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:27.220
No. No.

1005
01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:29.620
It's just you and me, baby.

1006
01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:30.720
No!

1007
01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:35.321
You got three guards.

1008
01:23:36.321 --> 01:23:37.621
One at your 2:00,

1009
01:23:39.121 --> 01:23:40.121
12:00

1010
01:23:41.621 --> 01:23:42.621
and 10:00.

1011
01:23:51.321 --> 01:23:52.321
Danger close. 2:00,

1012
01:23:52.521 --> 01:23:53.622
<i>fifty yards.</i>

1013
01:24:57.025 --> 01:24:58.125
<i>You got one right on you.</i>

1014
01:24:58.625 --> 01:24:59.625
20 yards and closing.

1015
01:25:50.328 --> 01:25:51.628
Go check the perimeter.

1016
01:25:52.128 --> 01:25:53.628
And tell the others to stay alert.

1017
01:25:53.728 --> 01:25:55.328
I'm on it. Right away, sir.

1018
01:26:29.630 --> 01:26:31.310
Swagger, you got one above you
on the roof.

1019
01:26:49.831 --> 01:26:51.031
You killed all three?

1020
01:26:52.031 --> 01:26:53.331
There were four.

1021
01:26:54.331 --> 01:26:57.632
I want Johnson's real name.
I want to know who he works for.

1022
01:26:57.932 --> 01:26:59.808
I want to know why it was worth
going through that much effort

1023
01:26:59.832 --> 01:27:01.232
to kill the Archbishop.

1024
01:27:02.232 --> 01:27:03.632
Aren't you the one that shot him?

1025
01:27:03.932 --> 01:27:05.832
And if I don't know any of those things?

1026
01:27:06.032 --> 01:27:07.192
Then you're of no worth to me

1027
01:27:07.232 --> 01:27:09.232
and I might as well shoot you now
and leave.

1028
01:27:13.632 --> 01:27:15.933
Johnson's had a lot of names.

1029
01:27:16.133 --> 01:27:19.733
Don't know one's any more real
than the next.

1030
01:27:20.033 --> 01:27:21.633
Knowing would only be dangerous.

1031
01:27:23.333 --> 01:27:24.833
He's ex-army.

1032
01:27:25.033 --> 01:27:27.333
Pretty sure he was a full-bird colonel.

1033
01:27:30.733 --> 01:27:31.833
Go on.

1034
01:27:33.633 --> 01:27:36.334
They came for me,
like they came for you.

1035
01:27:37.634 --> 01:27:39.934
Recruitment for a single job.

1036
01:27:41.634 --> 01:27:43.034
They like the wounded.

1037
01:27:44.234 --> 01:27:45.834
Easier to use

1038
01:27:47.034 --> 01:27:48.934
and then throw away
when you are done.

1039
01:27:50.334 --> 01:27:52.234
Timmons, you, me...

1040
01:27:55.035 --> 01:27:59.735
Once you've been a wolf, it's hard
to be staked down like a goat.

1041
01:28:01.035 --> 01:28:05.535
This is just one dead man
talking to another.

1042
01:28:06.935 --> 01:28:08.135
And the Archbishop?

1043
01:28:09.835 --> 01:28:13.536
You want to take all suspicions away
when you shoot someone,

1044
01:28:13.936 --> 01:28:16.236
wait till he's standing
next to the President.

1045
01:28:17.736 --> 01:28:19.136
What was he going to say?

1046
01:28:20.236 --> 01:28:21.436
The truth.

1047
01:28:21.736 --> 01:28:25.036
That nothing, no matter how horrible,

1048
01:28:25.336 --> 01:28:28.636
ever really happens
without the approval of the government.

1049
01:28:29.036 --> 01:28:30.837
Over there, and here.

1050
01:28:33.037 --> 01:28:34.737
The problem isn't the doing.

1051
01:28:36.337 --> 01:28:38.337
It's the people in power having to admit

1052
01:28:38.937 --> 01:28:39.937
that they knew.

1053
01:28:41.737 --> 01:28:44.437
The prisoners are tortured
at Abu Ghraib,

1054
01:28:44.637 --> 01:28:46.737
and only the underlings go to jail.

1055
01:28:47.537 --> 01:28:49.138
Their bosses knew.

1056
01:28:49.338 --> 01:28:51.338
We know their bosses knew.

1057
01:28:51.538 --> 01:28:52.638
But you don't say it.

1058
01:28:52.938 --> 01:28:54.538
What exactly happened in Africa?

1059
01:28:54.638 --> 01:28:57.038
Somehow the villagers didn't think

1060
01:28:57.338 --> 01:28:59.238
that an oil pipeline

1061
01:28:59.838 --> 01:29:02.538
was a good enough reason
to move their village

1062
01:29:02.838 --> 01:29:06.039
to a place
where the spirit gods didn't exist.

1063
01:29:06.239 --> 01:29:07.239
Drink?

1064
01:29:07.339 --> 01:29:08.615
So they asked them all nicely to move

1065
01:29:08.639 --> 01:29:10.115
and when they didn't,
they just killed them all?

1066
01:29:10.139 --> 01:29:11.139
No.

1067
01:29:11.239 --> 01:29:12.439
They didn't ask.

1068
01:29:12.839 --> 01:29:14.239
They just killed them.

1069
01:29:14.339 --> 01:29:15.339
AII.

1070
01:29:15.539 --> 01:29:18.439
So the next village
won't need to be asked.

1071
01:29:18.639 --> 01:29:19.839
They'll just go.

1072
01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:35.740
There is a mass grave with 400 bodies,

1073
01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:39.640
men, women, children,

1074
01:29:39.940 --> 01:29:44.341
under the oil pumping station
10 kilometres over the Eritrean border.

1075
01:29:46.241 --> 01:29:47.641
You should know.

1076
01:29:47.841 --> 01:29:51.741
You covered the retreat
of the contractors who did the job.

1077
01:29:53.241 --> 01:29:55.841
Of course, you weren't supposed
to survive that, either.

1078
01:30:05.142 --> 01:30:06.242
Who runs Johnson?

1079
01:30:06.442 --> 01:30:08.742
A senator. From Montana, I think.

1080
01:30:10.342 --> 01:30:11.942
You don't get it.

1081
01:30:12.442 --> 01:30:14.442
There is no head to cut off.

1082
01:30:15.742 --> 01:30:17.442
It's a conglomerate.

1083
01:30:18.142 --> 01:30:20.743
If one of them betrays the principles

1084
01:30:22.443 --> 01:30:24.543
of the accrual of money and power,

1085
01:30:25.843 --> 01:30:27.443
the others betray him.

1086
01:30:28.643 --> 01:30:30.043
What it is

1087
01:30:32.343 --> 01:30:34.543
is human weakness.

1088
01:30:36.043 --> 01:30:38.844
You can't kill that with a gun.

1089
01:30:46.744 --> 01:30:47.744
Swagger.

1090
01:30:47.944 --> 01:30:48.944
<i>Swagger.</i>

1091
01:30:49.144 --> 01:30:51.744
<i>You got to get out of there.
They're everywhere.</i>

1092
01:30:52.744 --> 01:30:55.644
Had to keep you till they got here.

1093
01:30:57.145 --> 01:31:00.345
Lying wasn't going to hold you.

1094
01:31:01.245 --> 01:31:02.745
You would have known.

1095
01:31:07.845 --> 01:31:11.045
By the way, they've got your woman.

1096
01:31:14.145 --> 01:31:15.146
<i>Swagger.</i>

1097
01:31:15.446 --> 01:31:18.646
They're 20 yards and closing.
You got to get out of there.

1098
01:31:20.646 --> 01:31:22.446
-Bug out. Go to hide two.
<i>-Roger that.</i>

1099
01:31:54.548 --> 01:31:56.148
Swagger, I'm in position two.

1100
01:31:57.148 --> 01:31:58.268
You got to get out of there.

1101
01:31:58.348 --> 01:31:59.748
<i>-They're all over the place.</i>
-Hey!

1102
01:32:00.448 --> 01:32:01.748
<i>Calm down.</i>

1103
01:32:01.948 --> 01:32:04.348
Blow the pipe bombs outside on my call,
okay? You got it?

1104
01:32:04.748 --> 01:32:06.448
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I got it.

1105
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:15.149
Listen very carefully.

1106
01:32:15.249 --> 01:32:16.749
On my one, you blow the pipe bombs,

1107
01:32:16.949 --> 01:32:18.049
<i>then the gas.</i>

1108
01:32:19.049 --> 01:32:20.649
Three, two, one...

1109
01:32:50.651 --> 01:32:51.851
Hit it. Hit the napalm.

1110
01:33:46.954 --> 01:33:47.954
Swagger!

1111
01:33:55.154 --> 01:33:56.354
You got it.

1112
01:34:07.755 --> 01:34:08.855
<i>Swagger!</i>

1113
01:34:11.355 --> 01:34:12.855
<i>Swagger!</i>

1114
01:34:13.655 --> 01:34:14.855
Swagger!

1115
01:34:21.556 --> 01:34:23.316
You got to bug out
on my go behind that barn.

1116
01:34:23.456 --> 01:34:24.456
Okay.

1117
01:34:24.556 --> 01:34:25.556
-You ready?
-Yeah.

1118
01:34:25.856 --> 01:34:26.856
Go!

1119
01:34:30.356 --> 01:34:31.356
Come on!

1120
01:34:59.758 --> 01:35:01.134
You got to gun it to that tree line.

1121
01:35:01.158 --> 01:35:02.158
What?

1122
01:35:02.358 --> 01:35:04.318
You got five shots left.
Gotta draw that bird out.

1123
01:35:04.358 --> 01:35:05.558
Okay. Okay.

1124
01:35:05.758 --> 01:35:07.558
-On my cover, all right?
-Okay.

1125
01:35:09.358 --> 01:35:10.358
All right, go!

1126
01:35:23.759 --> 01:35:25.259
Pull up! Pull up!

1127
01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:42.360
Time to go!

1128
01:36:00.261 --> 01:36:01.261
Let me take a look.

1129
01:36:01.661 --> 01:36:02.661
Not right now.

1130
01:36:03.161 --> 01:36:04.361
Morning, beautiful.

1131
01:36:04.661 --> 01:36:06.761
-See this weird shootout in Virginia?
-Sir...

1132
01:36:06.961 --> 01:36:11.062
Shells everywhere, helicopter remnants,
blood. No bodies, though, right?

1133
01:36:11.362 --> 01:36:14.862
And they get fingerprints
off the cartridge cases.

1134
01:36:15.062 --> 01:36:18.162
First set positively IDed
as Bob Lee Swagger.

1135
01:36:20.062 --> 01:36:23.362
Second set belongs
to Special Agent Nick Memphis

1136
01:36:24.062 --> 01:36:25.362
of the FBI.

1137
01:36:25.762 --> 01:36:27.262
What? That's gotta be wrong.

1138
01:36:30.663 --> 01:36:33.963
Now, the only reasonable question
to ask after that is,

1139
01:36:36.463 --> 01:36:37.663
what the fuck is going on?

1140
01:36:43.663 --> 01:36:44.963
Great shot!

1141
01:36:48.564 --> 01:36:50.964
-All yours, Dan!
-Good shooting!

1142
01:36:51.164 --> 01:36:54.364
I'm beginning to think that you were
the wrong man for the job.

1143
01:36:56.064 --> 01:36:57.464
Think what you want.

1144
01:37:00.164 --> 01:37:03.864
It appears we misjudged
the gunnery sergeant.

1145
01:37:05.865 --> 01:37:07.765
There's always a confused soul

1146
01:37:07.965 --> 01:37:10.465
that thinks that one man
can make a difference.

1147
01:37:11.665 --> 01:37:14.665
And you have to kill him
to convince him otherwise.

1148
01:37:17.265 --> 01:37:19.165
That's the hassle with democracy.

1149
01:37:19.665 --> 01:37:20.665
Pull!

1150
01:37:35.066 --> 01:37:36.866
...fire under their asses,
you understand me?

1151
01:37:37.066 --> 01:37:38.566
We need those results now.

1152
01:37:38.766 --> 01:37:41.242
Anna, you guys, you take the team...
Anna! ...to the roadhouse.

1153
01:37:41.266 --> 01:37:43.667
Okay, I don't care who it is right now.
I don't give...

1154
01:37:43.967 --> 01:37:46.967
Guys! We got Memphis on the line.

1155
01:37:47.167 --> 01:37:48.367
Start a trace.

1156
01:37:49.367 --> 01:37:50.867
Got it. I'm on it.

1157
01:37:51.067 --> 01:37:53.167
Nick. Hey, it's Howard here.
How are you?

1158
01:37:53.567 --> 01:37:56.567
Things have gotten a little complicated.
I got Bob Lee Swagger in custody.

1159
01:37:57.667 --> 01:37:59.567
Yeah, turns out he's not dead, Howard.

1160
01:37:59.767 --> 01:38:02.268
Yeah, I know. Word of that possibility
had begun to reach us.

1161
01:38:03.168 --> 01:38:04.268
Got him.

1162
01:38:04.468 --> 01:38:06.244
Were you in a gunfight
in Virginia last night?

1163
01:38:06.268 --> 01:38:08.868
Like I said,
things have gotten a little complicated.

1164
01:38:09.068 --> 01:38:13.268
Well, obviously the best thing for you
would be to bring him in, right?

1165
01:38:13.568 --> 01:38:15.368
Oh, no. I can't do that.

1166
01:38:15.568 --> 01:38:16.568
Why?

1167
01:38:16.668 --> 01:38:18.868
It's gotten too deep.
It's not clear who can be trusted.

1168
01:38:19.569 --> 01:38:21.769
-But we're the FBI, son.
<i>-Yeah, I know.</i>

1169
01:38:22.269 --> 01:38:23.369
Yeah, I'll keep in touch.

1170
01:38:23.769 --> 01:38:24.769
Oh, Nick, wait...

1171
01:38:24.969 --> 01:38:26.769
Son of a bitch.

1172
01:38:26.969 --> 01:38:28.089
-Did we get that?
-Got him.

1173
01:38:28.169 --> 01:38:29.245
-Let's move.
-They're on an interstate

1174
01:38:29.269 --> 01:38:31.369
-outside Bozeman, Montana.
-Let's move!

1175
01:38:37.169 --> 01:38:38.170
This is Swagger.

1176
01:38:38.370 --> 01:38:40.246
<i>-Colonel Johnson here.</i>
-Figured you'd be listening.

1177
01:38:40.270 --> 01:38:42.570
-It appears you have nowhere to go.
<i>-Colonel?</i>

1178
01:38:43.170 --> 01:38:44.270
If it is "Colonel"?

1179
01:38:44.470 --> 01:38:45.570
It is.

1180
01:38:47.170 --> 01:38:50.170
-I have something you want.
<i>-Well, it seems so do I.</i>

1181
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:57.771
<i>Over the Eritrean border,
there is a mass grave with 400 bodies.</i>

1182
01:38:58.171 --> 01:39:00.771
<i>Men, women, children.</i>

1183
01:39:02.071 --> 01:39:03.947
Tell you what, I'll give it to you
and we'll call it even.

1184
01:39:03.971 --> 01:39:05.491
I just want someone there I can trust.

1185
01:39:05.671 --> 01:39:08.071
I'm amenable.
Who do you have in mind?

1186
01:39:08.271 --> 01:39:10.071
How about that guy from U2
with the glasses?

1187
01:39:10.271 --> 01:39:12.571
Friend of Nelson Mandela and all.
He seems trustworthy.

1188
01:39:12.771 --> 01:39:14.672
Bono? You want them to get Bono?

1189
01:39:14.972 --> 01:39:18.072
My colleague's questioning
my choice. Okay,

1190
01:39:18.372 --> 01:39:21.672
I see how that could be a tough
problem. You know, last minute and all.

1191
01:39:22.772 --> 01:39:24.572
How about six-term senator
Charles Meachum

1192
01:39:24.872 --> 01:39:26.072
<i>from Montana?</i>

1193
01:39:26.372 --> 01:39:28.972
<i>Seems like a pretty good
second choice, don't you think?</i>

1194
01:39:30.872 --> 01:39:32.072
I don't think so.

1195
01:39:32.272 --> 01:39:34.973
I'm gonna provide you
with two numbers, then we'll talk.

1196
01:39:35.173 --> 01:39:37.673
Point 732. Point 648.

1197
01:39:38.373 --> 01:39:39.473
And what the hell is that?

1198
01:39:39.673 --> 01:39:42.833
Those are the last three digits, down to
a few metres of latitude and longitude,

1199
01:39:42.973 --> 01:39:44.773
of an oil pipeline pumping station
in Eritrea

1200
01:39:45.073 --> 01:39:46.273
<i>with 400 bodies underneath.</i>

1201
01:39:47.073 --> 01:39:48.173
Where are we meeting?

1202
01:39:49.873 --> 01:39:51.974
Somewhere I can see you,

1203
01:39:53.074 --> 01:39:55.774
coming from a goddamn long way off.

1204
01:41:04.377 --> 01:41:05.678
Where's your boy?

1205
01:41:20.078 --> 01:41:21.678
Well, I'm here.

1206
01:41:30.479 --> 01:41:31.479
He's here.

1207
01:41:31.679 --> 01:41:32.879
Look, look, look.

1208
01:41:33.879 --> 01:41:35.779
There's your boy.
There's your boy, baby.

1209
01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:46.580
Come on, come on. Look, look. Look up.

1210
01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:58.080
Okay.

1211
01:42:41.683 --> 01:42:43.283
I think I broke a rib!

1212
01:42:45.083 --> 01:42:46.183
Don't move!

1213
01:42:46.583 --> 01:42:47.983
Is there anybody else?

1214
01:42:48.683 --> 01:42:49.683
No.

1215
01:43:16.585 --> 01:43:19.185
He head-shoots me, spasm kills her!

1216
01:43:20.485 --> 01:43:22.385
You got no shot!

1217
01:43:22.585 --> 01:43:25.885
No shot, Swagger!
You hear that, Swagger?

1218
01:43:28.785 --> 01:43:30.485
You got no shot!

1219
01:43:31.185 --> 01:43:33.786
What are you gonna do? Come on!

1220
01:43:42.886 --> 01:43:44.486
It's over for you, buddy!

1221
01:43:49.586 --> 01:43:52.087
No shot! Okay, fuck him.

1222
01:44:06.287 --> 01:44:07.687
Not bad!

1223
01:44:07.887 --> 01:44:10.088
Pretty good! He went for the shot.

1224
01:44:12.588 --> 01:44:13.588
Christ.

1225
01:44:31.489 --> 01:44:32.489
How can we help you?

1226
01:44:32.789 --> 01:44:34.789
Guest at the motel last night
gave me $100

1227
01:44:34.989 --> 01:44:36.789
to bring this by here at 3:00 p.m.

1228
01:44:40.489 --> 01:44:41.589
Let's move!

1229
01:45:10.491 --> 01:45:11.591
You all right?

1230
01:45:12.391 --> 01:45:13.391
Yeah.

1231
01:45:23.692 --> 01:45:24.692
Search him.

1232
01:45:24.792 --> 01:45:26.292
I don't carry a weapon,

1233
01:45:29.392 --> 01:45:30.492
ordinarily.

1234
01:45:31.192 --> 01:45:33.192
I'm licensed to carry that in this state.

1235
01:45:41.293 --> 01:45:42.493
Pull the pilot.

1236
01:45:44.193 --> 01:45:46.193
Put your weapon down! Put it down!

1237
01:45:46.393 --> 01:45:47.493
Put your gun down!

1238
01:45:47.693 --> 01:45:48.693
Easy. Easy.

1239
01:45:59.193 --> 01:46:00.394
Sarah.

1240
01:46:01.294 --> 01:46:02.894
Give me the gun.

1241
01:46:03.694 --> 01:46:05.394
It's okay. Give me the gun.

1242
01:46:14.894 --> 01:46:15.994
You okay?

1243
01:46:16.094 --> 01:46:18.695
Put them up. Keep them up.

1244
01:46:18.895 --> 01:46:20.395
Nice shooting, Gunnie.

1245
01:46:21.495 --> 01:46:23.995
Yeah, you got what you came for.

1246
01:46:24.195 --> 01:46:26.315
I think it's time you owe us
your side of the bargain.

1247
01:46:26.495 --> 01:46:27.495
You do, huh?

1248
01:46:27.695 --> 01:46:30.595
Yes, I do, son. I certainly do.

1249
01:46:31.295 --> 01:46:34.195
Why don't we think about all this
that has gone on

1250
01:46:34.495 --> 01:46:36.195
just as a preamble?

1251
01:46:36.295 --> 01:46:38.096
You got any plans after this?

1252
01:46:38.796 --> 01:46:43.096
You have a rather unique skill set.
I'd be interested in offering you a job.

1253
01:46:43.396 --> 01:46:45.496
Work? For you?

1254
01:46:45.696 --> 01:46:49.296
It's not really as bad as it seems.
It's all gonna be done in any case.

1255
01:46:49.596 --> 01:46:52.996
You might as well be on the side
that gets you well paid for your efforts.

1256
01:46:53.196 --> 01:46:55.197
And what side are you on?

1257
01:46:55.397 --> 01:46:58.097
There are no sides.
There's no Sunnis and Shiites.

1258
01:46:58.397 --> 01:46:59.673
There's no Democrats and Republicans.

1259
01:46:59.697 --> 01:47:01.897
There's only haves and have-nots.

1260
01:47:02.097 --> 01:47:04.897
What exactly does working for you
entail, Senator?

1261
01:47:05.397 --> 01:47:08.497
Raping and murdering innocent women
and children, you sick fuck?

1262
01:47:08.797 --> 01:47:10.573
You sanctioned the mass murder
of an entire village

1263
01:47:10.597 --> 01:47:11.773
so a pipeline could go through.

1264
01:47:11.797 --> 01:47:13.297
One village!

1265
01:47:13.498 --> 01:47:15.398
And it brought stability to the region.

1266
01:47:15.598 --> 01:47:18.598
Which means that no one
chops off their arms

1267
01:47:18.898 --> 01:47:20.598
because their
grandmother's grandfather

1268
01:47:20.798 --> 01:47:22.398
belonged to a different tribe.

1269
01:47:23.398 --> 01:47:24.898
They like us down there, boy.

1270
01:47:31.899 --> 01:47:33.899
This is a country

1271
01:47:34.699 --> 01:47:36.899
where the Secretary of Defense

1272
01:47:39.099 --> 01:47:40.699
can go on TV

1273
01:47:41.099 --> 01:47:43.199
and tell the American public,

1274
01:47:43.499 --> 01:47:46.899
oh, that " This is about freedom!
It's not about oil!"

1275
01:47:47.899 --> 01:47:49.799
And nobody questions him,

1276
01:47:49.899 --> 01:47:51.476
because they don't want to hear
the answer

1277
01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:52.700
because it's a lie!

1278
01:47:55.300 --> 01:47:59.300
There's only so many places
at the table, Gunnie.

1279
01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:01.500
Now are you on the inside,

1280
01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:03.100
or are you on the out?

1281
01:48:10.301 --> 01:48:11.501
It's the FBI!

1282
01:48:12.501 --> 01:48:14.001
It's gonna be okay. Hold this.

1283
01:48:16.701 --> 01:48:19.901
<i>If one of them betrays
the principles of the accrual...</i>

1284
01:48:20.201 --> 01:48:21.801
I don't think so, Senator.

1285
01:48:26.101 --> 01:48:27.902
-What are you doing?
-Saving our lives.

1286
01:48:28.502 --> 01:48:30.678
-That proved you were innocent!
-Nobody out here is innocent!

1287
01:48:30.702 --> 01:48:34.402
This stuff's plutonium.
Nobody can handle it without dying.

1288
01:48:34.702 --> 01:48:38.002
You hand it over to the authorities,
it's just gonna disappear, along with us!

1289
01:48:38.202 --> 01:48:41.102
Unless you want to get buried
in the hills outside Terlingua.

1290
01:48:41.302 --> 01:48:42.802
I'm out, old man!

1291
01:48:43.002 --> 01:48:45.703
I'm just a peckerwood who lives
in the hills with too many guns.

1292
01:48:45.903 --> 01:48:47.103
You happy?

1293
01:48:51.503 --> 01:48:53.203
Where do you think you're going?

1294
01:48:53.303 --> 01:48:54.703
Washington!

1295
01:48:54.903 --> 01:48:59.103
You going to shoot
a sitting U.S. Senator in the back?

1296
01:48:59.403 --> 01:49:00.903
Lord knows I want to.

1297
01:49:01.903 --> 01:49:03.303
I didn't think so.

1298
01:49:04.604 --> 01:49:05.704
Let him go.

1299
01:49:06.804 --> 01:49:08.404
They've got your rifle.

1300
01:49:10.004 --> 01:49:12.404
From the beginning,
they've always had your rifle.

1301
01:49:12.604 --> 01:49:14.104
Recovered at the site.

1302
01:49:21.604 --> 01:49:24.105
You can talk as much as you want,
but in the end,

1303
01:49:24.705 --> 01:49:27.105
you're going to die by lethal injection,

1304
01:49:27.305 --> 01:49:29.705
and I'm going to go back
to what I was doing.

1305
01:49:35.005 --> 01:49:36.105
I won.

1306
01:49:37.205 --> 01:49:38.505
You lost.

1307
01:49:39.405 --> 01:49:41.406
Get used to the idea, son.

1308
01:49:42.006 --> 01:49:43.306
I'm not your son.

1309
01:49:58.106 --> 01:50:00.307
-Drop your weapons! Put it down now!
-Don't move!

1310
01:50:00.507 --> 01:50:03.907
Special Agent Nick Memphis, FBI!
Don't shoot!

1311
01:50:04.107 --> 01:50:06.207
-Down, now!
-On the ground!

1312
01:50:06.907 --> 01:50:07.907
I said get down!

1313
01:50:27.308 --> 01:50:29.808
-Could I free my hands, please?
-It's okay.

1314
01:50:30.008 --> 01:50:31.608
Thank you, sir.

1315
01:50:33.108 --> 01:50:34.708
Thanks for bringing her.

1316
01:50:40.309 --> 01:50:42.809
Hey. I'm sorry about everything.

1317
01:50:43.009 --> 01:50:45.209
It's not your fault. It is what it is.

1318
01:50:49.109 --> 01:50:51.709
This is Attorney General Russert.

1319
01:50:52.709 --> 01:50:55.210
-Director Brandt.
-Sir.

1320
01:50:55.410 --> 01:50:57.610
Senator Meachum couldn't be
with us today.

1321
01:50:57.810 --> 01:50:59.910
I'm sure we can manage without him.

1322
01:51:00.110 --> 01:51:02.310
Sergeant Swagger,
you asked for this meeting.

1323
01:51:03.510 --> 01:51:06.610
Against my better judgement,
I've agreed to it as a favour to the FBI.

1324
01:51:06.810 --> 01:51:08.210
What the hell am I doing here?

1325
01:51:08.510 --> 01:51:10.510
You've got nothing on me. I'm covered.

1326
01:51:11.110 --> 01:51:12.410
Call the Joint Chief.

1327
01:51:14.111 --> 01:51:15.431
That won't be necessary, Colonel,

1328
01:51:15.611 --> 01:51:17.811
as I have already received
no less than a dozen calls

1329
01:51:18.011 --> 01:51:20.411
from highly-ranked
and powerfully-placed individuals

1330
01:51:20.611 --> 01:51:22.011
telling me to let you go.

1331
01:51:22.111 --> 01:51:25.111
But the joy of checks and balances
in our government is that I can,

1332
01:51:26.211 --> 01:51:27.611
and am, indeed, required by law,

1333
01:51:27.811 --> 01:51:29.911
to tell them to fuck off.

1334
01:51:30.111 --> 01:51:31.788
This is about evidence
and finding out the truth,

1335
01:51:31.812 --> 01:51:33.712
so you sit there and be quiet.

1336
01:51:37.412 --> 01:51:39.312
Sergeant, you've got five minutes.

1337
01:51:39.512 --> 01:51:40.612
Thank you.

1338
01:51:42.912 --> 01:51:44.512
This is my weapon.

1339
01:51:44.712 --> 01:51:46.912
No question about it, don't deny it.

1340
01:51:47.112 --> 01:51:49.552
You recovered it at the scene
moments after the assassination.

1341
01:51:49.612 --> 01:51:50.613
We agree?

1342
01:51:51.313 --> 01:51:52.989
It's been in the FBI's possession
ever since,

1343
01:51:53.013 --> 01:51:54.389
hasn't been tampered with in any way?

1344
01:51:54.413 --> 01:51:55.913
No. Absolutely not.

1345
01:51:56.113 --> 01:51:58.113
-You fire the weapon?
-There was no point.

1346
01:51:58.313 --> 01:52:00.413
The slug was mangled
beyond recognition.

1347
01:52:00.613 --> 01:52:03.413
It was, however,
an exact metallurgical match.

1348
01:52:03.613 --> 01:52:05.813
Right. Definitely my bullets.

1349
01:52:07.113 --> 01:52:08.714
Definitely my gun.

1350
01:52:08.814 --> 01:52:11.214
Special Agent Memphis,
you believe I shot that Archbishop?

1351
01:52:11.414 --> 01:52:12.814
Nope. No, I don't.

1352
01:52:13.114 --> 01:52:15.414
-Have any proof of this fact?
-No.

1353
01:52:15.714 --> 01:52:17.014
-Trust me?
-Yep.

1354
01:52:17.314 --> 01:52:18.314
Really trust me?

1355
01:52:18.714 --> 01:52:19.814
Yeah.

1356
01:52:20.814 --> 01:52:21.914
With your life?

1357
01:52:22.614 --> 01:52:23.914
-Yep.
-Good.

1358
01:52:25.614 --> 01:52:27.896
-What the hell are you doing?
-Put that weapon down now!

1359
01:52:28.015 --> 01:52:30.715
If you're zeroed for 600,
you ought to aim a little lower.

1360
01:52:31.015 --> 01:52:32.591
Ain't gonna make a difference
this close.

1361
01:52:32.615 --> 01:52:33.891
Only thing
that's gonna make a difference

1362
01:52:33.915 --> 01:52:35.315
is whether I'm crazy or not.

1363
01:52:41.815 --> 01:52:43.515
I could keep doing this all day,

1364
01:52:44.315 --> 01:52:45.816
with every weapon in my house.

1365
01:52:46.416 --> 01:52:49.316
I swapped all the firing pins
before I left the house. I always do.

1366
01:52:49.516 --> 01:52:51.516
Looks right, need a micrometer to tell.

1367
01:52:52.016 --> 01:52:53.316
But the gun don't shoot.

1368
01:52:53.816 --> 01:52:55.892
That bullet you got out of that bishop
was fired from my weapon,

1369
01:52:55.916 --> 01:52:57.616
but a week before, at a can of stew.

1370
01:52:57.716 --> 01:53:00.916
I did take an oath to defend this country
from all enemies, foreign and domestic.

1371
01:53:01.116 --> 01:53:03.316
I just didn't figure I'd end up
quite this involved.

1372
01:53:03.617 --> 01:53:05.293
But at the end of the day,
when all the dust settles,

1373
01:53:05.317 --> 01:53:07.817
you can't hide from the truth,
you son of a bitch.

1374
01:53:09.217 --> 01:53:10.317
Whatever.

1375
01:53:11.117 --> 01:53:12.517
Who gives a shit?

1376
01:53:14.017 --> 01:53:15.417
Nice presentation.

1377
01:53:15.617 --> 01:53:17.317
But none of it sticks to me.

1378
01:53:18.517 --> 01:53:21.617
Gentlemen, this meeting is over.

1379
01:53:21.817 --> 01:53:23.018
Done.

1380
01:53:23.218 --> 01:53:24.518
I'll be seeing you.

1381
01:53:24.618 --> 01:53:27.618
He's right. There's nothing
to prove he did anything.

1382
01:53:28.018 --> 01:53:29.118
Yeah, in this country.

1383
01:53:29.218 --> 01:53:31.718
Sir, you should take a look at these.

1384
01:53:37.218 --> 01:53:42.519
These images are from a classified file
showing a village of people in Africa

1385
01:53:42.919 --> 01:53:45.419
that were exterminated
by the colonel and his associates.

1386
01:53:45.719 --> 01:53:46.719
My God.

1387
01:53:46.819 --> 01:53:47.919
Look around you.

1388
01:53:48.619 --> 01:53:50.619
This isn't the Horn of Africa.

1389
01:53:50.819 --> 01:53:52.319
That's all hearsay.

1390
01:53:52.519 --> 01:53:55.019
This is the land of the free
and the home of the brave.

1391
01:53:55.319 --> 01:53:56.619
And I'm free to go.

1392
01:53:57.319 --> 01:53:59.040
Colonel, your moral compass is
so fucked up,

1393
01:53:59.220 --> 01:54:02.920
I'll be shocked if you manage
to find your way back to the parking lot.

1394
01:54:03.220 --> 01:54:05.220
Regardless of how I feel about this,

1395
01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:07.920
these events occurred
in another country,

1396
01:54:08.020 --> 01:54:09.220
outside of our laws.

1397
01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:11.820
So that's it? That's the best you can do?

1398
01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:14.020
This isn't the World Court, Sergeant.

1399
01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:17.120
And I don't have the jurisdiction
to detain the colonel

1400
01:54:17.421 --> 01:54:19.981
for crimes he may or may not have
committed on another continent.

1401
01:54:20.121 --> 01:54:23.521
-Sir, I urge you to reconsider...
-There's nothing to reconsider, son.

1402
01:54:27.121 --> 01:54:28.721
I win.

1403
01:54:28.921 --> 01:54:30.021
You lose.

1404
01:54:30.821 --> 01:54:31.921
Again.

1405
01:54:34.221 --> 01:54:35.721
This is ridiculous.

1406
01:54:58.123 --> 01:55:01.423
For the record, I don't like the way
this turned out any more than you do.

1407
01:55:02.223 --> 01:55:04.123
But this is the world we live in.

1408
01:55:04.323 --> 01:55:07.023
And justice does not always prevail.

1409
01:55:07.223 --> 01:55:08.223
It's not the Wild West,

1410
01:55:08.523 --> 01:55:10.723
where you can clean up the streets
with a gun.

1411
01:55:12.023 --> 01:55:14.724
Even though sometimes
that's exactly what's needed.

1412
01:55:19.524 --> 01:55:21.924
Bob Lee Swagger, you're free to go.

1413
01:55:26.224 --> 01:55:27.924
Unshackle the sergeant.

1414
01:55:31.325 --> 01:55:33.425
I'd say that's quite a shot, Senator.

1415
01:55:33.725 --> 01:55:34.925
In the face.

1416
01:55:36.325 --> 01:55:38.425
You heard that expression,

1417
01:55:38.725 --> 01:55:40.825
"You didn't know whether to shit
or go blind"?

1418
01:55:45.025 --> 01:55:48.025
You should've seen the look
on the Attorney General's face.

1419
01:55:49.225 --> 01:55:53.326
Did he give his
checks-and-balances speech?

1420
01:55:53.726 --> 01:55:56.926
"This is about evidence and the truth!"

1421
01:55:57.226 --> 01:55:59.626
And then you just said to him,

1422
01:55:59.826 --> 01:56:01.226
"Fuck you!"

1423
01:56:02.226 --> 01:56:04.526
"Hold my cigar, Mr A.G."

1424
01:56:06.926 --> 01:56:08.127
"Fuck you!

1425
01:56:09.927 --> 01:56:12.227
"The truth is what I say it is!"

1426
01:56:19.427 --> 01:56:21.727
You know, you got to be
out of the country in the morning.

1427
01:56:21.927 --> 01:56:23.627
You're going to Ecuador.

1428
01:56:27.128 --> 01:56:30.528
Well, we're having some problems
with the locals.

1429
01:56:30.828 --> 01:56:34.128
We have our personnel on the ground
ready to neutralise the problem, but...

1430
01:56:34.628 --> 01:56:36.228
Well, they've requested you.

1431
01:56:38.128 --> 01:56:39.428
It's solvable.

1432
01:56:42.128 --> 01:56:43.328
They requested you...

1433
01:56:45.529 --> 01:56:46.729
Swagger.

1434
01:56:51.629 --> 01:56:52.729
Turn off the lights!

1435
01:57:00.029 --> 01:57:01.229
Get my car.

1436
01:57:01.429 --> 01:57:02.529
Get my car.

1437
01:57:22.631 --> 01:57:23.631
Do something.

1438
01:57:24.231 --> 01:57:25.331
Do something!

1439
01:57:33.731 --> 01:57:34.831
Where is he?

1440
01:57:47.632 --> 01:57:48.732
He's under the floor!

1441
01:58:19.534 --> 01:58:21.034
You don't need to kill me.

1442
01:58:22.434 --> 01:58:24.034
You don't need to kill me. It was them.

1443
01:58:24.534 --> 01:58:25.634
It was them.

1444
01:58:28.234 --> 01:58:30.834
God damn it! Just wait a minute!

1445
01:58:33.334 --> 01:58:35.635
Hold it just a minute. Hold it.

1446
01:58:37.935 --> 01:58:41.135
Are you out of your mind?
Are you out of your damn mind?

1447
01:58:41.535 --> 01:58:44.235
I am a United States senator!

1448
01:58:44.535 --> 01:58:45.535
Exactly.

1449
02:05:32.185 --> 02:05:34.186
English
