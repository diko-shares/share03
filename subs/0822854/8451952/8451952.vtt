will be taken from beyond a mile.

164

That's because long shots
generally go places

to make a shot at that range?

168
00:13:57.123 --> 00:13:59.592

169
00:13:59.658 --> 00:14:01.993
Humidity, elevation,
temperature, wind, spindrift.

170
00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:05.473
There's a 6-to-10-second flight time so you
have to shoot at where the target's going to be.

171
00:14:05.497 --> 00:14:08.600
Even the Coriolis effect, the spin of the Earth,
comes into play.

00:14:08.666 --> 00:14:11.869

01:08:24.082 --> 01:08:25.984
Good.

852
01:08:33.558 --> 01:08:36.928
-(RETCHING)
-Got to pee yet?

853
01:08:36.995 --> 01:08:38.997
Got to flush them drugs
out of your system.

854
01:08:39.063 --> 01:08:41.466
Look awful suspicious if you were
to go and shoot yourself

855
01:08:41.533 --> 01:08:44.068
pumped full of the same shit
the agency uses.

856
01:08:44.135 --> 01:08:46.505
I'm not going to shoot myself.

857
01:08:46.571 --> 01:08:50.141
Sure you will.
Take him out. Get him ready.

858
01:08:50.208 --> 01:08:52.010
No!

859
01:08:52.076 --> 01:08:54.378
(GROANING)

860
01:08:57.014 --> 01:08:59.550
-That's my gun.
-Yeah.

861
01:08:59.617 --> 01:09:01.785
You wrote a real touching
suicide note, too.

862
01:09:01.852 --> 01:09:05.323
All overwrought with guilt
about your mistakes.

863
01:09:11.028 --> 01:09:13.597
Quit your struggling.

864
01:09:16.667 --> 01:09:19.970
This thing works.
It's not the first time we've used it.

865
01:09:25.175 --> 01:09:27.177
Russo. Russo!

866
01:09:27.244 --> 01:09:30.614
-Davis, get out here!
-(GRUNTING)

867
01:09:31.949 --> 01:09:33.584
(GROANS)

868
01:09:33.651 --> 01:09:36.987
What is the goddamn hold-up?

869
01:10:12.555 --> 01:10:16.225
Don't kill me, please!
Don't kill me! I believe you!

870
01:10:16.292 --> 01:10:20.096
Kill you? Had enough chances.
I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.

871
01:10:20.162 --> 01:10:24.401
What kind of asshole'd
think up a thing like this?

872
01:10:30.706 --> 01:10:32.140
(GRUNTING)

873
01:10:32.207 --> 01:10:36.244
Not bad with a poodle shooter
and a makeshift silencer, huh?

874
01:10:36.311 --> 01:10:38.947
Help me toss these boys in the water?

875
01:10:39.014 --> 01:10:41.383
You set me up
and you used me as bait!

876
01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:44.620
You think? Flushed them out, didn't it?

877
01:10:44.686 --> 01:10:47.699
I was kind of hoping to keep one alive,
but they were kind of determined to kill you.

878
01:10:47.723 --> 01:10:50.225
You can hire a good lawyer,
and I'll call the Bureau.

879
01:10:50.291 --> 01:10:53.595
They can work out some kind of deal.

880
01:10:53.662 --> 01:10:56.040
This is explainable. You can prove that
you didn't shoot the archbishop.

881
01:10:56.064 --> 01:10:59.000
I don't think you understand.
These boys killed my dog.

882
01:11:01.603 --> 01:11:04.673
Hey, this is the 21st century.
You can't go to war with these people.

883
01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:06.007
In the end, the law is all...

884
01:11:06.074 --> 01:11:08.677
In the end, the law'll never catch
and hold them.

885
01:11:08.744 --> 01:11:10.779
In a year or two,
they'll be back in business.

886
01:11:10.846 --> 01:11:14.348
New names, new messenger boys,
same old story. And I'll be dead.

887
01:11:14.415 --> 01:11:16.417
It's gonna be some hard,
hairy work, Pork.

888
01:11:16.484 --> 01:11:18.895
There's gonna be more shooting,
and more people are gonna die.

889
01:11:18.919 --> 01:11:22.022
Now, I didn't start it, but be sure
as hell I mean to see it through.

890
01:11:22.089 --> 01:11:24.559
So you get it straight.
You in or you out?

891
01:11:27.294 --> 01:11:29.063
You know, I missed a meeting today

892
01:11:29.129 --> 01:11:32.032
where I was going to get fired
for unprofessional conduct

893
01:11:32.099 --> 01:11:35.836
because I was kidnapped
by people that don't exist.

894
01:11:39.674 --> 01:11:41.676
I'll take his legs.

895
01:11:41.742 --> 01:11:43.978
It's a good call, Pork.

896
01:11:44.044 --> 01:11:46.747
You're trying to tell me
a rookie FBI agent

897
01:11:46.814 --> 01:11:49.216
overpowered and killed the three of them?

898
01:11:49.283 --> 01:11:50.785
No.

899
01:11:50.851 --> 01:11:54.622
They were shot from a distance
of about 200 yards.

900
01:11:55.923 --> 01:11:57.925
With a .22.

901
01:12:00.093 --> 01:12:01.961
-Swagger's alive.
-Yes.

902
01:12:02.028 --> 01:12:03.930
And that young kid,

903
01:12:03.997 --> 01:12:07.000
FBI Agent

904
01:12:07.066 --> 01:12:09.002
Nick Memphis,

905
01:12:09.068 --> 01:12:12.806
who managed to pry out
a Delta-level clearance,

906
01:12:12.872 --> 01:12:17.511
hasn't come back to the office
and is out there with him.

907
01:12:19.345 --> 01:12:21.781
-What?
-I just went over Swagger's financials again.

908
01:12:21.848 --> 01:12:26.085
Once a year, he sent flowers
to someone with his Visa card.

909
01:12:26.152 --> 01:12:29.422
I cracked the FTD database,
got an address.

910
01:12:29.489 --> 01:12:31.825
Donnie Fenn's widow.
Anniversary of his death.

911
01:12:31.891 --> 01:12:36.663
She went back to using her maiden name,
which is why we missed it the first time.

912
01:12:36.730 --> 01:12:38.898
She's maybe the only person
in the entire world

913
01:12:38.965 --> 01:12:41.100
that would believe anything
that Swagger had to say.

914
01:12:41.167 --> 01:12:43.770
Look. Keene City, Kentucky.

915
01:12:43.837 --> 01:12:46.071
It's just within driving range.

916
01:12:46.138 --> 01:12:49.041
What are you waiting for?
Take the jet.

917
01:12:49.107 --> 01:12:50.643
All right.

918
01:12:56.915 --> 01:13:00.085
We've given Swagger a new war,

919
01:13:00.152 --> 01:13:01.787
he's found a new spotter.

920
01:13:01.854 --> 01:13:04.823
This is about to get worse.

921
01:13:31.683 --> 01:13:34.819
I think we're here.

922
01:13:36.287 --> 01:13:38.723
Hey. Swagger.

923
01:13:41.693 --> 01:13:43.728
I think we're here.

924
01:13:46.163 --> 01:13:48.700
Welcome to Tennessee.

925
01:13:48.766 --> 01:13:51.102
Patron state of shooting stuff.

926
01:13:52.570 --> 01:13:54.538
Hey, who is this guy?

927
01:13:54.606 --> 01:13:56.974
This guy was the greatest gunsmith
east of the Mississippi.

928
01:13:57.041 --> 01:13:58.643
He's a legend.

929
01:13:58.710 --> 01:14:01.746
He knows more about guns and the people
who shoot them than Smith & Wesson.

930
01:14:01.813 --> 01:14:04.457
Don't really matter anymore. He knew
we were coming the last three miles.

931
01:14:04.481 --> 01:14:06.283
-You mind your manners.
-All right.

932
01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:09.386
You boys come a long way.
What you looking for?

933
01:14:09.453 --> 01:14:11.455
Wisdom.

934
01:14:11.522 --> 01:14:14.659
-You come to the wrong place.
-Maybe.

935
01:14:14.726 --> 01:14:17.428
Say a man wanted to fire a bullet
from one rifle

936
01:14:17.494 --> 01:14:19.362
and have it match exactly to another.

937
01:14:19.429 --> 01:14:22.365
-Could that be done?
-Take a seat.

938
01:14:22.432 --> 01:14:24.735
Have a chair, son.

939
01:14:27.503 --> 01:14:31.441
If you could get a bullet that had been
shot clean through the first rifle,

940
01:14:31.507 --> 01:14:33.409
could make the grooves match.

941
01:14:33.476 --> 01:14:35.879
Kind of thing ain't been done
in a long time, though.

942
01:14:35.946 --> 01:14:39.349
The bullet that was taken out of the archbishop
was completely mangled on impact.

943
01:14:39.415 --> 01:14:41.284
FBI match was metallurgical.

944
01:14:41.351 --> 01:14:44.320
-Thank you, Mother.
-Yeah, but you couldn't guarantee that going in.

945
01:14:44.387 --> 01:14:48.191
So they had to be sure. And I still
can't figure out how they could be.

946
01:14:51.261 --> 01:14:54.230
-Good coffee?
-Yep.

947
01:14:54.297 --> 01:14:58.334
Look on your left, there.
Second shelf down.

948
01:14:58.401 --> 01:15:00.804
Red leather spine.

949
01:15:00.871 --> 01:15:03.907
Written by a guy named Schofeld.

950
01:15:03.974 --> 01:15:08.678
Put it there 15 years ago.
Don't figure it's moved since then.

951
01:15:20.690 --> 01:15:24.226
(ROOSTER CROWING)

952
01:15:27.730 --> 01:15:31.100
Yeah. Paper patching.

953
01:15:31.166 --> 01:15:33.736
State of the art. 1870s Africa.

954
01:15:33.803 --> 01:15:35.170
Paper-wrapped bullet.

955
01:15:35.237 --> 01:15:37.406
No metal on metal
going down the barrel.

956
01:15:37.472 --> 01:15:41.376
Grooves would match.
Paper unwinds at the muzzle.

957
01:15:41.443 --> 01:15:43.045
Leaves no traces when it hits.

958
01:15:43.112 --> 01:15:46.849
Interesting question, though.
Hope I satisfied you.

959
01:15:46.916 --> 01:15:50.185
-I got another one.
-I thought you might.

960
01:15:50.252 --> 01:15:53.521
Suppose I was looking for a man to make
a 2,200-yard cold-bore shot.

961
01:15:53.587 --> 01:15:55.556
Who's alive that could do that?

962
01:15:55.623 --> 01:15:59.694
Seems I heard about a shot like that
being made not too long ago.

963
01:15:59.761 --> 01:16:03.031
Said the guy's name
was Bob Lee Swagger.

964
01:16:03.097 --> 01:16:05.633
Never met the man,
so I wouldn't know him.

965
01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:07.401
Yeah, they said that, all right.

966
01:16:07.468 --> 01:16:11.639
They also said that artificial
sweeteners were safe,

967
01:16:11.706 --> 01:16:14.175
and WMDs were in Iraq,

968
01:16:14.242 --> 01:16:17.045
and Anna Nicole married for love!

969
01:16:18.813 --> 01:16:21.215
Would've been
a bad job to take, though.

970
01:16:21.282 --> 01:16:22.717
How come?

971
01:16:22.784 --> 01:16:24.819
Whoever took that shot's
probably dead now.

972
01:16:24.886 --> 01:16:26.487
That's how a conspiracy works.

973
01:16:26.554 --> 01:16:30.992
Them boys on the grassy knoll,
they were dead within three hours.

974
01:16:31.059 --> 01:16:34.562
Buried in the damn desert.
Unmarked graves out past Terlingua.

975
01:16:34.628 --> 01:16:37.998
-And you know this for a fact?
-Still got the shovel.

976
01:16:40.167 --> 01:16:42.102
Sake of argument,
somebody other than him?

977
01:16:42.169 --> 01:16:45.605
There was a guy in Russia.
They locked his ass up.

978
01:16:45.672 --> 01:16:49.276
Another one in France.
I know he's dead.

979
01:16:49.342 --> 01:16:51.011
There was one guy,

980
01:16:51.078 --> 01:16:53.947
but he don't shoot no more.

981
01:16:54.014 --> 01:16:56.416
A brutal son of a bitch.

982
01:16:56.483 --> 01:17:00.587
Most boys shoot to kill.
He'd shoot to wound,

983
01:17:00.653 --> 01:17:04.324
wait till his friends come to help,
kill them too.

984
01:17:04.391 --> 01:17:07.227
Turned one target into four.

985
01:17:07.294 --> 01:17:10.430
Men, women, children.
Killed them by the hundreds.

986
01:17:10.497 --> 01:17:13.533
The other side wanted him. Bad.

987
01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:19.172
Finally narrowed his hide down to an
abandoned six-story building.

988
01:17:19.239 --> 01:17:21.809
They quit the subtle tactics.

989
01:17:21.875 --> 01:17:24.576
They called in an artillery strike.

990
01:17:24.643 --> 01:17:26.278
Leveled a square block.

991
01:17:26.345 --> 01:17:28.781
Brought the building down on his ass.

992
01:17:28.848 --> 01:17:31.250
Some say he crawled out of there.

993
01:17:31.317 --> 01:17:33.519
Some say he died.

994
01:17:33.585 --> 01:17:35.922
Never heard from him no more.

995
01:17:35.988 --> 01:17:38.825
-Fuck me.
-What?

996
01:17:38.891 --> 01:17:40.492
I met the son of a bitch.

997
01:17:45.197 --> 01:17:47.766
Yeah. The world ain't what it seems,
is it, Gunnie?

998
01:17:47.834 --> 01:17:49.568
No, sir.

999
01:17:49.635 --> 01:17:51.237
You keep that in mind.

1000
01:17:51.303 --> 01:17:53.806
The moment you think
you got it figured,

1001
01:17:53.873 --> 01:17:56.075
you're wrong.

1002
01:17:57.676 --> 01:18:00.312
He got a name?

1003
01:18:00.379 --> 01:18:02.414
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

1004
01:18:04.984 --> 01:18:06.785
<i>Hey, it's me, Nick.</i>

1005
01:18:06.853 --> 01:18:10.221
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in?

1006
01:18:10.288 --> 01:18:12.590
-Yeah.
<i>-Are you okay? Nick, where are you?</i>

1007
01:18:12.657 --> 01:18:17.128
It's better I don't tell you.
Look, do you have a pen?

1008
01:18:17.195 --> 01:18:19.664
<i>I need you to find someone.

1009
01:18:19.730 --> 01:18:21.099
-Yeah.
<i>-You got it?</i>

1010
01:18:21.166 --> 01:18:23.935
-I got it.
-Man, this is hard to spell.

1011
01:18:29.274 --> 01:18:32.777
Swagger is going to go
with what he knows.

1012
01:18:32.844 --> 01:18:34.712
He'll try to track the shooter.

1013
01:18:34.779 --> 01:18:37.382
He won't get far that way.

1014
01:18:37.448 --> 01:18:39.084
Yes, he will.

1015
01:18:39.150 --> 01:18:41.352
-How's that?
-We're going to help him.

1016
01:18:41.419 --> 01:18:44.422
Sometimes to catch a wolf,
you need to tie the bait to a tree.

1017
01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:52.430
And what happens to the bait?

1018
01:18:54.465 --> 01:18:56.800
Hard to say.

1019

-What are you doing?
-Saving our lives.

1365

-That proved you were innocent!
-Nobody out here is innocent!

1366
01:48:30.467 --> 01:48:33.871
This stuff's plutonium.
Nobody can handle it without dying.

1367
01:48:33.938 --> 01:48:35.906
You hand it over to the authorities,

1368
01:48:35.973 --> 01:48:38.008
it's just gonna disappear, along with us!

1369
01:48:38.075 --> 01:48:41.178
Unless you want to get buried
in the hills outside Terlingua.

1370
01:48:41.245 --> 01:48:42.913
I'm out, old man!

1371
01:48:42.980 --> 01:48:46.350
I'm just a peckerwood who lives
in the hills with too many guns.

1372
01:48:46.416 --> 01:48:48.352

Washington!

1376
01:48:55.292 --> 01:48:59.496
You going to shoot a sitting U.S.
senator in the back?

1377
01:48:59.563 --> 01:49:03.300
-Lord knows I want to.
-I didn't think so.

1378
01:49:04.501 --> 01:49:06.569
SWAGGER: Let him go.

1379
01:49:06.636 --> 01:49:09.338
They've got your rifle.

1380
01:49:09.405 --> 01:49:12.208
From the beginning,
they've always had your rifle.

1381
01:49:12.275 --> 01:49:14.243
Recovered at the site.

1382
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:23.887
You can talk as much as you want,
but in the end,

1383
01:49:23.953 --> 01:49:27.290
you're going to die by lethal injection,

1384
01:49:27.356 --> 01:49:30.860
and I'm going to go back
to what I was doing.

1385
01:49:34.864 --> 01:49:37.901
I won. You lost.

1386
01:49:37.967 --> 01:49:41.437
Get used to the idea, son.

1387
01:49:41.504 --> 01:49:43.673
I'm not your son.

Put it down now!

1389

Don't shoot!

1391

-Mm-hmm.

1396
01:50:40.561 --> 01:50:42.797
Hey. I'm sorry about everything.

1397
01:50:42.864 --> 01:50:45.933
It's not your fault. It is what it is.

1398
01:50:49.136 --> 01:50:52.539
This is Attorney General Russert.

1399
01:50:52.606 --> 01:50:55.009
-Director Brandt.
-Sir.

1400
01:50:55.076 --> 01:50:57.478
Senator Meachum
couldn't be with us today.

1401
01:50:57.544 --> 01:50:59.280
I'm sure we can manage without him.

1402
01:50:59.346 --> 01:51:03.217
Sergeant Swagger,
you asked for this meeting.

1403
01:51:03.284 --> 01:51:06.520
Against my better judgment,
I've agreed to it as a favor to the FBI.

1404
01:51:06.587 --> 01:51:09.690
What the hell am I doing here?
You've got nothing on me.

1405
01:51:09.757 --> 01:51:11.959
I'm covered. Call the Joint Chief.

1406
01:51:13.194 --> 01:51:15.196
That won't be necessary, Colonel,

1407
01:51:15.262 --> 01:51:18.065
as I have already received
no less than a dozen calls

1408
01:51:18.132 --> 01:51:20.301
from highly-ranked and
powerfully-placed individuals

1409
01:51:20.367 --> 01:51:22.236
telling me to let you go.

1410
01:51:22.303 --> 01:51:25.671
But the joy of checks and balances
in our government is that I can,

1411
01:51:25.738 --> 01:51:29.342
and am, indeed, required by law,
to tell them to fuck off.

1412
01:51:29.409 --> 01:51:32.045
This is about evidence
and finding out the truth,

1413
01:51:32.112 --> 01:51:35.348
so you sit there and be quiet.

1414
01:51:36.783 --> 01:51:38.651
Sergeant, you've got five minutes.

1415
01:51:38.718 --> 01:51:40.520
Thank you.

1416
01:51:42.755 --> 01:51:44.257
This is my weapon.

1417
01:51:44.324 --> 01:51:46.426
No question about it, don't deny it.

1418
01:51:46.492 --> 01:51:49.262
You recovered it at the scene
moments after the assassination.

1419
01:51:49.329 --> 01:51:50.463
We agree?

1420
01:51:50.530 --> 01:51:52.698
It's been in the FBI's possession
ever since,

1421
01:51:52.765 --> 01:51:54.300
hasn't been tampered with in any way?

1422
01:51:54.367 --> 01:51:55.969
No. Absolutely not.

1423
01:51:56.036 --> 01:51:58.038
-You fire the weapon?
-There was no point.

1424
01:51:58.104 --> 01:52:00.273
The slug was mangled
beyond recognition.

1425
01:52:00.340 --> 01:52:03.143
It was, however,
an exact metallurgical match.

1426
01:52:03.209 --> 01:52:06.512
Right. Definitely my bullets.

1427
01:52:06.579 --> 01:52:08.448
Definitely my gun.

1428
01:52:08.514 --> 01:52:11.316
Special Agent Memphis,
you believe I shot that archbishop?

1429
01:52:11.383 --> 01:52:13.118
Nope. No, I don't.

1430
01:52:13.185 --> 01:52:15.420
-Have any proof of this fact?
-No.

1431
01:52:15.487 --> 01:52:17.056
-Trust me?
-Yep.

1432
01:52:17.122 --> 01:52:20.525
-Really trust me?
-Yeah.

1433
01:52:20.592 --> 01:52:22.227
With your life?

1434
01:52:22.294 --> 01:52:25.264
-Yep.
-Good.

1435
01:52:25.330 --> 01:52:28.033
What the hell are you doing?
Put that weapon down now!

1436
01:52:28.100 --> 01:52:30.735
If you're zeroed for 600,
you ought to aim a little lower.

1437
01:52:30.802 --> 01:52:32.671
Ain't gonna make a difference this close.

1438
01:52:32.737 --> 01:52:36.408
Only thing that's gonna make a difference
is whether I'm crazy or not.

1439
01:52:38.844 --> 01:52:41.246
(CLICKING)

1440
01:52:41.313 --> 01:52:45.384
I could keep doing this all day,
with every weapon in my house.

1441
01:52:45.450 --> 01:52:49.388
I swapped all the firing pins
before I left the house. I always do.

1442
01:52:49.454 --> 01:52:51.523
Looks right, need a micrometer to tell.

1443
01:52:51.590 --> 01:52:53.792
But the gun don't shoot.

1444
01:52:53.859 --> 01:52:56.137
That bullet you got out of that bishop
was fired from my weapon,

1445
01:52:56.161 --> 01:52:57.962
but a week before, at a can of stew.

1446
01:52:58.029 --> 01:53:00.740
I did take an oath to defend this country from
all enemies, foreign and domestic.

1447
01:53:00.764 --> 01:53:03.234
I just didn't figure I'd end up
quite this involved.

1448
01:53:03.301 --> 01:53:05.379
But at the end of the day,
when all the dust settles,

1449
01:53:05.403 --> 01:53:09.073
you can't hide from the truth,
you son of a bitch.

1450
01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:12.543
Whatever. Who gives a shit?

1451
01:53:12.610 --> 01:53:15.146
Nice presentation.

1452
01:53:15.213 --> 01:53:17.916
But none of it sticks to me.

1453
01:53:17.982 --> 01:53:21.385
Gentlemen, this meeting is over.

1454
01:53:21.452 --> 01:53:22.786
Done.

1455
01:53:22.853 --> 01:53:24.555
I'll be seeing you.

1456
01:53:24.622 --> 01:53:27.425
He's right. There's nothing
to prove he did anything.

1457
01:53:27.491 --> 01:53:29.727
Yeah, in this country.

1458
01:53:29.793 --> 01:53:32.596
Sir, you should take a look at these.

1459
01:53:36.500 --> 01:53:39.303
These images are from a classified file

1460
01:53:39.370 --> 01:53:41.772
showing a village of people in Africa

1461
01:53:41.839 --> 01:53:44.874
that were exterminated
by the colonel and his associates.

1462
01:53:44.942 --> 01:53:48.278
RUSSERT: My God. Look around you.

1463
01:53:48.345 --> 01:53:51.748
This isn't the Horn of Africa.
That's all hearsay.

1464
01:53:51.814 --> 01:53:54.484
This is the land of the free
and the home of the brave.

1465
01:53:54.551 --> 01:53:57.287
And I'm free to go.

1466
01:53:57.354 --> 01:53:59.489
RUSSERT: Colonel,
your moral compass is so fucked up,

1467
01:53:59.556 --> 01:54:02.068
I'll be shocked if you manage
to find your way back to the parking lot.

1468
01:54:02.092 --> 01:54:05.328
Regardless of how I feel about this,

1469
01:54:05.395 --> 01:54:08.565
these events occurred in another
country, outside of our laws.

1470
01:54:08.631 --> 01:54:11.801
So that's it?
That's the best you can do?

1471
01:54:11.868 --> 01:54:14.604
This isn't the World Court, Sergeant.

1472
01:54:14.671 --> 01:54:16.974
And I don't have the jurisdiction
to detain the colonel

1473
01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:19.842
for crimes he may or may not have
committed on another continent.

1474
01:54:19.909 --> 01:54:21.744
Sir, I urge you to reconsider...

1475
01:54:21.811 --> 01:54:24.681
There's nothing to reconsider, son.

1476
01:54:26.616 --> 01:54:29.718
I win. You lose.

1477
01:54:29.785 --> 01:54:31.353
Again.

1478
01:54:33.655 --> 01:54:36.358
This is ridiculous.

1479
01:54:56.979 --> 01:54:58.780
For the record,

1480
01:54:58.847 --> 01:55:01.717
I don't like the way this turned out
any more than you do.

1481
01:55:01.783 --> 01:55:03.819
But this is the world we live in.

1482
01:55:03.885 --> 01:55:06.989
And justice does not always prevail.

1483
01:55:07.056 --> 01:55:11.660
It's not the Wild West, where you can
clean up the streets with a gun.

1484
01:55:11.727 --> 01:55:15.097
Even though sometimes
that's exactly what's needed.

1485
01:55:19.267 --> 01:55:22.437

1486

Attorney General's face.

01:55:48.496 --> 01:55:53.168
Did he give his
checks-and-balances speech?

1494
01:55:53.234 --> 01:55:56.304
"This is about evidence and the truth!"

1495
01:55:56.371 --> 01:55:59.440
And then you just said to him,

1496
01:55:59.507 --> 01:56:02.043
"Fuck you!"
