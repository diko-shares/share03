1
00:02:00.041 --> 00:02:02.377
He stole the chip, he's inside.

2
00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:05.380
Fucker!

3
00:02:28.785 --> 00:02:30.119
Kirill!

4
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:32.872
Time to work.

5
00:04:12.453 --> 00:04:18.418
At 0030 hours, the mission
deviated from the set parameters.

6
00:04:18.543 --> 00:04:22.423
It wasn't part of the plan
for our agent to get shot in the back.

7
00:04:27.638 --> 00:04:29.139
Identity confirmed.

8
00:04:29.473 --> 00:04:32.894
McGrath was uploading some data
to us when he was killed.

9
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.190
Take a look at this.
I'm not sure yet exactly what it is.

10
00:04:39.194 --> 00:04:42.990
A fragment of a complex molecule.
- Gibbons.

11
00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.452
We think it's a link
to a Soviet bio-weapon

12
00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:48.163
called Silent Night.

13
00:04:48.497 --> 00:04:51.583
James, what the hell is he doing here?
- I called him in.

14
00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:54.629
We've lost three agents already.
You could use the help.

15
00:04:54.755 --> 00:04:58.050
I found out your agents were killed by
this group, Anarchy 99.

16
00:04:58.175 --> 00:05:02.597
They're ex-military. They can smell
the training on our agents a mile away.

17
00:05:02.848 --> 00:05:06.852
Sir, I think it's time we tried
something new.

18
00:05:15.697 --> 00:05:18.617
These guys aren't ours.
Who are they? CIA?

19
00:05:18.868 --> 00:05:23.039
No, civilians. Convicts, mercs,
contract killers.

20
00:05:23.206 --> 00:05:25.542
The best and brightest
of the bottom of the barrel.

21
00:05:25.667 --> 00:05:30.048
They're the scum of the earth.
- Programmable, expendable, effective.

22
00:05:30.924 --> 00:05:33.009
I think it's our best shot.

23
00:05:33.177 --> 00:05:36.222
Do we want to drop another
mouse in the snake pit?

24
00:05:36.514 --> 00:05:39.934
Or send our own snake
and let him crawl in?

25
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.943
Sacramento, California

26
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.534
Come on, Pepe. This is unbelievable.

27
00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:55.787
Hello!

28
00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:58.708
Well, it's about time. Now, listen...

29
00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:02.045
Were you coming from Tijuana?
I don't mean to be rude.

30
00:06:02.212 --> 00:06:05.048
Keep it out of the sun.
I don't want the paint to fade.

31
00:06:05.216 --> 00:06:08.720
Do you understand English?
I pay enough for you people.

32
00:06:12.976 --> 00:06:16.229
Come on, Janelle.
You're gonna love this place.

33
00:06:17.064 --> 00:06:19.775
Dick, how are you?
- This is Janelle.

34
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.746
Call 911 .
- Who's driving my car?

35
00:06:36.671 --> 00:06:39.633
Senator Hotchkiss!
California state Senate!

36
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.094
Listen, somebody just stole my car!

37
00:07:07.626 --> 00:07:10.504
You, in the red Corvette!
Pull over immediately!

38
00:07:10.671 --> 00:07:15.134
Yeah, yeah. These monkeys are
following me because I took this car.

39
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:18.221
Obviously the car doesn't belong to me,
it's not my style.

40
00:07:18.514 --> 00:07:23.687
It belongs to Dick, Dick Hotchkiss,
a California state senator.

41
00:07:23.854 --> 00:07:26.857
You remember Dick.
He tried to ban rap music

42
00:07:27.066 --> 00:07:30.111
because he feels the lyrics
promote violence.

43
00:07:30.237 --> 00:07:31.697
It's music, Dick!

44
00:07:32.072 --> 00:07:36.578
He also wants to pull every video game
off every shelf in the country

45
00:07:36.703 --> 00:07:42.543
because he feels that the video games
diminish the intelligence of our youth.

46
00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:44.671
Come on, Dick.

47
00:07:45.547 --> 00:07:47.674
It's the only education we got.

48
00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:53.223
You're a bad man.
You know what we do to bad men.

49
00:07:53.557 --> 00:07:54.850
We punish them.

50
00:07:55.184 --> 00:08:01.065
Dick, you've just entered
the Xander zone.

51
00:08:01.566 --> 00:08:04.653
I'm coming in hot with a side of bacon!

52
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.208
Go!

53
00:08:36.109 --> 00:08:37.151
Pull it!

54
00:08:57.802 --> 00:08:59.513
Yes!

55
00:09:24.835 --> 00:09:26.838
Go get the cameras! Go!

56
00:09:31.803 --> 00:09:34.597
Moral is, don't be a dick, Dick!

57
00:09:40.731 --> 00:09:44.985
You guys got the cameras?
All right, let's go, let's go!

58
00:09:51.034 --> 00:09:52.535
Peace out!

59
00:10:24.993 --> 00:10:26.995
Outstanding.

60
00:10:27.579 --> 00:10:28.997
Thank you.

61
00:10:30.624 --> 00:10:32.751
What's up?
- You invited these people?

62
00:10:32.919 --> 00:10:34.045
Of course not.

63
00:10:39.094 --> 00:10:40.887
That's my dog! What's up?

64
00:10:41.012 --> 00:10:43.932
Today was off the hook!
You're psycho, bro!

65
00:10:44.099 --> 00:10:46.935
Psycho? That was off the chain, man!

66
00:10:47.061 --> 00:10:52.318
Yo, yo, yo! What's up with that crazy
trick that we've been hearing about?

67
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.822
My Superman seat-grab barrel roll?
- Word.

68
00:10:55.947 --> 00:10:58.575
I'm still working on it.

69
00:11:00.286 --> 00:11:02.079
You're a hard guy to get a hold of.

70
00:11:02.789 --> 00:11:06.836
You know, an athlete like you should
really have his own video game.

71
00:11:07.003 --> 00:11:10.715
Jordan King. I can make it happen.

72
00:11:11.299 --> 00:11:14.552
I'll hold on to this for later.
- You do that.

73
00:11:19.935 --> 00:11:22.938
You know he'll never sell out.
That's why he is who he is.

74
00:11:23.147 --> 00:11:25.900
So you need to relax.
Who invited you, anyway?

75
00:11:25.984 --> 00:11:27.902
Shut up.

76
00:11:32.868 --> 00:11:36.789
Listen, this is for real. I can get us
an advance on Internet pre-sales.

77
00:11:36.914 --> 00:11:39.792
So you need to just go to Pago Pago
or something.

78
00:11:40.043 --> 00:11:43.004
Get some girls, do them all.
I don't care. Go on vacation.

79
00:11:43.171 --> 00:11:46.926
It's Bora Bora, J.
I got enough girls here.

80
00:11:47.052 --> 00:11:49.930
Since when did you care so much
about money?

81
00:11:50.055 --> 00:11:53.058
I just need you to lay low
till the heat's off, okay?

82
00:11:53.559 --> 00:11:58.189
I run a secret website. I got tapes to
make and I can't do that with you in jail.

83
00:11:58.649 --> 00:12:01.653
Did you see that?
- I don't care. Listen to me.

84
00:12:02.529 --> 00:12:03.530
I'm untouchable.

85
00:12:13.083 --> 00:12:15.545
Let's go! Get out! Move!

86
00:12:15.712 --> 00:12:17.589
Okay, I'll turn down the music.

87
00:12:25.056 --> 00:12:27.600
It was only a Corvette.

88
00:12:32.024 --> 00:12:34.902
Let's go, baby.
Your order is getting cold.

89
00:12:39.908 --> 00:12:43.746
Want coffee?
- Can you give me some hash browns?

90
00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:47.584
Sure.
- Make them sloppy. I like them runny.

91
00:12:48.252 --> 00:12:49.628
How did I get here?

92
00:12:49.962 --> 00:12:54.592
Two big guys dropped you off 10 minutes
ago. Told me to look after you.

93
00:12:54.759 --> 00:12:57.179
You look like you could use
some coffee.

94
00:13:13.241 --> 00:13:14.909
You all right?

95
00:13:15.076 --> 00:13:16.661
Fine.

96
00:13:31.221 --> 00:13:34.766
I said, you got a problem, boy?

97
00:13:35.142 --> 00:13:36.643
No. No problem.

98
00:13:37.688 --> 00:13:39.898
Nobody make a move!
- Nobody move!

99
00:13:40.024 --> 00:13:44.612
Just couldn't let him leave.
Keep your goddamned mouth shut!

100
00:13:44.737 --> 00:13:48.950
Keep still or you'll stop breathing.
- Empty the goddamn register!

101
00:13:53.957 --> 00:13:55.667
Get back!

102
00:13:55.918 --> 00:13:57.670
Get back. Get back!

103
00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:07.056
Well done, Mr. Cage.
- Who the hell are you?

104
00:14:07.683 --> 00:14:11.228
The name's Gibbons. Augustus Gibbons.

105
00:14:11.812 --> 00:14:14.189
You seem upset. ls there a problem?

106
00:14:14.691 --> 00:14:16.943
What is this place?
- Looks like a diner.

107
00:14:17.194 --> 00:14:19.196
That's clever.

108
00:14:20.031 --> 00:14:22.951
You almost had me going there
for a while.

109
00:14:23.076 --> 00:14:27.164
I was a bit groggy before,
then I started noticing things.

110
00:14:28.332 --> 00:14:31.669
Like, you got a stockbroker over here,
all dressed up

111
00:14:31.795 --> 00:14:36.968
reading the Financial Times
on Sunday when the market's closed.

112
00:14:37.093 --> 00:14:40.680
Unlikely, but okay, I can go with that.

113
00:14:40.848 --> 00:14:44.852
I could even go with the stick-up man
packing a cop-issue Beretta.

114
00:14:45.019 --> 00:14:49.024
But you want to know where you blew it?
With her.

115
00:14:49.275 --> 00:14:52.153
My aunt was in the restaurant business.

116
00:14:52.279 --> 00:14:56.867
There's no way a career waitress
comes to work in high heels.

117
00:14:57.034 --> 00:14:59.411
She'd have blisters
the size of pancakes.

118
00:14:59.912 --> 00:15:03.250
And if she ain't real, then this whole
thing ain't real.

119
00:15:03.751 --> 00:15:07.088
That's how I knew that this bozo
wouldn't get a shot off

120
00:15:07.214 --> 00:15:10.092
even if we waited
till St. Patrick's Day.

121
00:15:12.219 --> 00:15:15.222
Because there's nothing but blanks
in these guns.

122
00:15:16.267 --> 00:15:20.104
And no offense,

123
00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:24.776
but their performances were terrible.

124
00:15:30.367 --> 00:15:34.079
That's good. That's very good.

125
00:15:34.163 --> 00:15:37.249
It's your turn, pretty boy.

126
00:15:39.127 --> 00:15:43.256
What the hell is going on here?
- It was a test that you aced.

127
00:15:44.009 --> 00:15:48.013
He seems to have a poor attitude.
- Excuse me?

128
00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.892
Should we throw him back?
- Hell, no. I love his attitude.

129
00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.021
Let's take this to the next level.
Get on the Sat-Com.

130
00:15:55.147 --> 00:15:57.274
Take what to the next level?

131
00:15:57.609 --> 00:16:00.779
Yo! Take what?
- I want everybody out in 10 minutes.

132
00:16:00.905 --> 00:16:03.825
I don't play this game.

133
00:16:03.908 --> 00:16:07.245
Get Mike a doctor or he'll look like me.
- I got a party.

134
00:16:07.579 --> 00:16:09.998
Shut him up.
- And pay for my windows!

135
00:16:17.341 --> 00:16:21.220
Why is it always the assholes
who pass the tests?

136
00:16:44.333 --> 00:16:47.962
You guys haven't been
to any diners lately?

137
00:16:50.214 --> 00:16:52.007
Diner finalists.

138
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.229
What, no coffee?
- Yeah.

139
00:17:02.563 --> 00:17:04.857
Here comes the ROTC.
- Here we go.

140
00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:08.278
Where's my peanuts?
- Nice.

141
00:17:10.073 --> 00:17:12.075
Can you ask for the stewardess?

142
00:17:16.288 --> 00:17:20.250
Standing by to deploy drogue.
- Roger, deploying drogue parachute.

143
00:17:29.388 --> 00:17:31.348
This will hurt.
- What the hell?

144
00:17:46.033 --> 00:17:48.160
Release drogue now.
- Roger.

145
00:17:50.205 --> 00:17:52.415
This ain't right!

146
00:17:52.666 --> 00:17:54.334
I live for this shit!

147
00:18:13.149 --> 00:18:14.901
Not bad!

148
00:18:17.197 --> 00:18:18.949
Let's do that again!

149
00:18:33.091 --> 00:18:36.136
Holy shit. This is Colombia.

150
00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:39.306
Cocaine, man. These are coke plants!

151
00:18:45.189 --> 00:18:46.649
No keys.

152
00:18:48.401 --> 00:18:52.655
What the hell are you doing?
- You know what this shit's worth?

153
00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.661
What now? Is this another test?

154
00:18:57.746 --> 00:19:01.042
Let's go across the river. Let's go!
- Yeah, good idea! Good idea!

155
00:19:09.218 --> 00:19:12.680
You monkeys are too good for me.
I failed this test.

156
00:19:15.393 --> 00:19:17.937
You guys got something to drink?

157
00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:32.330
Nice to see you again, fellas.

158
00:19:32.622 --> 00:19:34.290
Yeah, you too.

159
00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:38.003
Boy, they went all out on this one.

160
00:20:06.413 --> 00:20:08.039
You've got to be kidding.

161
00:20:15.133 --> 00:20:17.135
Okay, funny guys.

162
00:20:17.719 --> 00:20:21.139
I'll show you what we do
when you get in our business.

163
00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:25.770
What? Hog-tie us and force us
to listen to your bad accent?

164
00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.814
No.

165
00:20:28.357 --> 00:20:33.446
We cut their Achilles tendon and watch
them flop around like a marionette.

166
00:20:33.738 --> 00:20:38.411
Unless you have something to tell me,
something I need to know?

167
00:20:38.662 --> 00:20:41.164
Okay. You're short.

168
00:20:43.876 --> 00:20:48.172
My friend says you could use a haircut
to update your style. Get off me.

169
00:20:50.175 --> 00:20:51.469
Shut up!

170
00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.807
Two seconds ago you told us to talk.
Now it's "Shut up?"

171
00:20:55.891 --> 00:21:00.145
I don't mean to nitpick, but you're
the worst at this torture thing.

172
00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:05.903
You slap me again,
I'm going to throw you a beating.

173
00:21:11.869 --> 00:21:14.371
I hope they're paying you
extra for this.

174
00:21:14.872 --> 00:21:18.877
You know what, funny guy?
Maybe I'll cut off your nose first.

175
00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:21.463
Funny guy.

176
00:21:21.756 --> 00:21:26.344
What's funny is, this actually smells
like real blood.

177
00:21:27.805 --> 00:21:31.893
I hope you like it, because it's the
last thing you're going to smell.

178
00:21:56.924 --> 00:21:59.635
I'm hit! I'm hit! I'm hit!

179
00:22:06.185 --> 00:22:07.645
Virg! Give me a hand.

180
00:22:18.993 --> 00:22:19.994
This is the Colombian army!

181
00:22:20.244 --> 00:22:21.870
Give up, you're surrounded!

182
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:28.838
Try to walk, T.J. Try to walk.

183
00:22:28.964 --> 00:22:30.799
Virg! Get out here!

184
00:22:32.217 --> 00:22:35.429
To hell with this.
Every man for himself.

185
00:22:58.291 --> 00:23:00.001
I'll get us some wheels.

186
00:23:00.877 --> 00:23:02.337
Hang in there.

187
00:23:02.713 --> 00:23:03.672
Good luck.

188
00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.306
The guy on the bike,
that's the drug lord!

189
00:24:19.682 --> 00:24:20.851
Let's get him!

190
00:24:38.455 --> 00:24:39.456
T.J.!

191
00:25:56.884 --> 00:25:59.679
X! I'm over here! X!

192
00:26:18.786 --> 00:26:20.371
There he is!

193
00:27:27.788 --> 00:27:29.790
We toasted his ass!

194
00:27:41.179 --> 00:27:42.305
I got us a bike.

195
00:27:48.521 --> 00:27:50.189
Pussies!

196
00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:04.081
Look who it is. Frankenstein. Uncuff me
so I can beat the shit out of you.

197
00:28:04.208 --> 00:28:07.670
Relax, X, you just graduated
at the head of your class.

198
00:28:07.879 --> 00:28:11.299
What are you talking about?
You almost got us killed.

199
00:28:11.716 --> 00:28:14.093
We knew the army was moving.
- Excuse me?

200
00:28:14.219 --> 00:28:17.973
It was my idea to send you as
a decoy. How do you like that?

201
00:28:22.355 --> 00:28:25.358
You're pretty fast for an old man.
- Get up.

202
00:28:28.362 --> 00:28:30.072
Walk with me.

203
00:28:31.949 --> 00:28:36.538
I believe under the right
circumstances, a man can change.

204
00:28:36.872 --> 00:28:40.751
For instance, last night you exhibited
courage, leadership,

205
00:28:40.877 --> 00:28:43.296
and willingness to protect
a man you hardly knew.

206
00:28:43.755 --> 00:28:46.968
So give me a medal.
- I'd rather give you a job.

207
00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:51.097
Look at me. Do I look like a fan
of law enforcement?

208
00:28:51.348 --> 00:28:53.767
This is your lucky day, Xander.

209
00:28:53.935 --> 00:28:56.396
This is your chance
to pay your Uncle Sam,

210
00:28:56.813 --> 00:28:58.982
for all your wonderful freedoms.

211
00:28:59.107 --> 00:29:00.901
The job's not that difficult.

212
00:29:01.111 --> 00:29:04.823
I want you to meet people and
find out what you can about them.

213
00:29:04.948 --> 00:29:06.741
What type of people?

214
00:29:06.867 --> 00:29:12.039
Dangerous, dirty, tattooed,
uncivilized. Your kind of people.

215
00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:14.836
Hold up.

216
00:29:15.879 --> 00:29:20.300
My kind of people would say,
"Kiss my ass, scarface."

217
00:29:21.761 --> 00:29:24.889
Usually I'd take my gun,
press it to your temple,

218
00:29:24.973 --> 00:29:28.018
and ask you very politely
to do what I want.

219
00:29:28.144 --> 00:29:31.856
But you're not afraid of death.
That puts us in a quandary.

220
00:29:31.982 --> 00:29:35.319
We better call this a day, then.
- Not just yet.

221
00:29:36.821 --> 00:29:39.449
You ever watch lions at the zoo?

222
00:29:40.283 --> 00:29:44.956
You can tell which were captured
in the wild by the look in their eyes.

223
00:29:45.081 --> 00:29:46.165
The wild cat.

224
00:29:47.042 --> 00:29:50.295
She remembers running across the plain,
the thrill of the hunt.

225
00:29:50.421 --> 00:29:54.383
Four hundred pounds of killing fury
locked in a box.

226
00:29:55.176 --> 00:29:58.013
But after a while,
their eyes glaze over,

227
00:29:58.264 --> 00:30:01.100
and you can tell their soul has died.

228
00:30:01.476 --> 00:30:03.895
The same thing happens to a man.

229
00:30:04.021 --> 00:30:06.815
Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary
is no joke.

230
00:30:06.941 --> 00:30:10.946
They'll take a wild man and
throw him in solitary just for fun.

231
00:30:11.238 --> 00:30:16.494
No more mountains to board,
no more oceans to surf.

232
00:30:16.911 --> 00:30:22.125
Just a 6-by-8 cell with no window
and only a bucket to shit in.

233
00:30:23.044 --> 00:30:25.506
You can avoid that
by doing me this favor.

234
00:30:25.965 --> 00:30:28.009
You don't have shit on me.

235
00:30:28.175 --> 00:30:32.096
I noticed you have three X's
tattooed on the back of your neck.

236
00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:37.979
I think that's rather appropriate since
you're looking at three strikes.

237
00:30:38.105 --> 00:30:42.568
Grand theft, reckless endangerment,
and that bridge stunt of yours

238
00:30:43.027 --> 00:30:45.237
makes you a three-time loser.

239
00:30:45.405 --> 00:30:48.366
Maybe you ought to call yourself
"Triple X."

240
00:30:49.368 --> 00:30:54.124
But if you do what I want, I'll make
all your transgressions go away,

241
00:30:54.249 --> 00:30:58.003
and let you get back
to that pathetic excuse of a life.

242
00:30:59.964 --> 00:31:02.425
Or you think maybe
I should be like you.

243
00:31:03.969 --> 00:31:07.056
Get all shot up for the old
Stars and Stripes.

244
00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:11.978
I bet that flag is a real comfort
every time you look in the mirror.

245
00:31:12.104 --> 00:31:17.026
A small price I paid for putting
foot to ass for my country.

246
00:31:21.533 --> 00:31:24.369
So, what's it going to be, Triple X?

247
00:31:24.453 --> 00:31:27.122
You want to get on a plane,

248
00:31:27.289 --> 00:31:32.044
or is "Kiss my ass, scarface"
your final answer?

249
00:31:42.183 --> 00:31:45.436
Prague, Czech Republic

250
00:32:00.913 --> 00:32:02.540
Yo. What's your name, slick?

251
00:32:02.959 --> 00:32:04.127
My name is Ivan.

252
00:32:04.293 --> 00:32:08.422
Ivan? What's your name, buddy?
- My name is Ivan.

253
00:32:08.507 --> 00:32:10.300
You're both Ivan?

254
00:32:39.836 --> 00:32:41.421
Take a seat.

255
00:32:42.214 --> 00:32:45.009
Idiots! Where is the American agent?

256
00:32:45.177 --> 00:32:46.178
This is him, Sir.

257
00:32:47.847 --> 00:32:50.349
We better order another bodybag.

258
00:32:51.226 --> 00:32:53.228
Guys, what's up?

259
00:32:54.855 --> 00:32:56.231
I told you to sit down.

260
00:32:56.565 --> 00:33:00.320
I've just been on a plane for 12 hours.
I think I'll stand.

261
00:33:00.404 --> 00:33:03.532
My name is Milan Sova,
Czech secret police.

262
00:33:03.991 --> 00:33:06.410
Here, you are under my jurisdiction.

263
00:33:06.494 --> 00:33:09.080
You take my orders, you do what I say.

264
00:33:09.247 --> 00:33:12.585
If you become any kind of an
inconvenience, I'll shoot you.

265
00:33:13.211 --> 00:33:15.588
That's great.
Is this where I'm staying?

266
00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:19.218
Your government is putting pressure
on mine.

267
00:33:19.343 --> 00:33:23.305
This is an internal Czech affair
that you are interfering with.

268
00:33:23.431 --> 00:33:26.393
I will warn you once:
Don't shit in my lawn.

269
00:33:26.519 --> 00:33:31.316
Get whatever information
your government seeks and get out.

270
00:33:31.608 --> 00:33:33.276
Let's get this straight.

271
00:33:33.444 --> 00:33:37.240
You may not want me here,
but I definitely don't want to be here.

272
00:33:37.407 --> 00:33:40.620
Two, I've never been
under anyone's jurisdiction.

273
00:33:41.412 --> 00:33:43.831
Three, if you're going to shoot anybody

274
00:33:44.124 --> 00:33:46.501
shoot that monkey
that sold you the suit.

275
00:33:46.835 --> 00:33:49.337
Now, I'm tired. I'm going to sleep.

276
00:33:51.341 --> 00:33:53.886
Be ready in three hours.

277
00:33:58.475 --> 00:34:01.269
Everybody in this club
has two things in common:

278
00:34:01.395 --> 00:34:07.443
They're rich and they're criminals.
- I'll fit in, except for the rich part.

279
00:34:21.879 --> 00:34:25.383
Remember, we don't know each other.
- I wish we didn't.

280
00:34:39.567 --> 00:34:42.236
Yeah, can I get a cranberry club soda?

281
00:34:43.279 --> 00:34:46.824
Throw this back there?
I'll tip you something.

282
00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:49.286
Put it in the back.

283
00:34:50.539 --> 00:34:53.500
How much? Do I get a ticket?

284
00:34:58.465 --> 00:35:01.510
That's them. Anarchy 99.

285
00:35:01.885 --> 00:35:03.554
You see the guy on the couch?

286
00:35:03.889 --> 00:35:06.350
That's Yorgi. He's the leader.

287
00:35:06.433 --> 00:35:11.188
He owns this club and five others like
it. All, how do you say, cash cows.

288
00:35:11.356 --> 00:35:12.857
American?!

289
00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:18.906
Guys, I'm American.
I'm going to see Yorgi. Yorgi!

290
00:35:19.241 --> 00:35:21.410
Hey, Yorgi! I hear you're the guy--

291
00:35:25.331 --> 00:35:27.458
I heard you're the guy
to talk to about cars.

292
00:35:27.917 --> 00:35:29.210
Take yourself outside.

293
00:35:29.586 --> 00:35:31.881
Take myself outside? I'm just--

294
00:35:33.633 --> 00:35:36.386
Okay. I'm not welcome.

295
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:39.181
Guess you'd rather have cops
in your club.

296
00:35:42.435 --> 00:35:43.436
Want to talk?

297
00:35:43.979 --> 00:35:47.567
Hey, you silly boy. Come with me
and show me the cop,

298
00:35:47.859 --> 00:35:49.861
and don't be mistake.

299
00:35:50.028 --> 00:35:53.406
See that guy there,
with the suit made out of drapes?

300
00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:55.325
That's a cop.

301
00:36:00.249 --> 00:36:03.502
Is there a problem?
I just had a drink, you know?

302
00:36:04.004 --> 00:36:08.801
I already paid. I'm going to
give a big tip, you know?

303
00:36:15.184 --> 00:36:18.521
So, what is this all about?
I've done nothing.

304
00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:22.275
You've done nothing?
Who do you work for?

305
00:36:23.402 --> 00:36:25.612
I work in a bank. So what?

306
00:36:26.364 --> 00:36:27.991
You've got to be...

307
00:36:28.617 --> 00:36:31.995
What are you doing? Stop it! Stop it!

308
00:36:34.332 --> 00:36:36.501
What's that, your bus pass?

309
00:36:36.627 --> 00:36:39.547
Czech 5-0. Czech 5-0.

310
00:36:42.009 --> 00:36:43.010
Leave my club.

311
00:36:46.431 --> 00:36:47.932
How did you know?

312
00:36:48.016 --> 00:36:53.355
When he was paying for his drinks, he
was flashing his badge to half the bar.

313
00:36:53.522 --> 00:36:54.606
Cops like plague.

314
00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:58.945
No matter how many you pay, there's
always another with his hand out.

315
00:36:59.071 --> 00:37:01.407
I'm from the streets.
I know cops, believe me.

316
00:37:01.574 --> 00:37:06.371
I appreciate you bringing this to our
attention. My question to you is why?

317
00:37:06.872 --> 00:37:09.626
I figure, no one likes cops
crashing their party.

318
00:37:09.918 --> 00:37:12.587
I figure, I do you a solid,
we could talk.

319
00:37:14.215 --> 00:37:16.592
I just want to buy cars, man.

320
00:37:18.052 --> 00:37:20.304
Is this guy going to hump my leg?

321
00:37:22.057 --> 00:37:23.434
What's your name?

322
00:37:26.021 --> 00:37:27.355
Xander Cage.

323
00:37:29.442 --> 00:37:30.985
I knew it.

324
00:37:31.068 --> 00:37:35.322
You are amazing on snowboard,
motorbike, everything.

325
00:37:35.448 --> 00:37:37.910
You're awesome.
- Thank you, man.

326
00:37:38.036 --> 00:37:42.374
My brother is crazy too,
and a great admirer of yours.

327
00:37:42.499 --> 00:37:46.044
He has seen your tapes many times.
Now we can talk business.

328
00:37:46.337 --> 00:37:47.880
This way, please.

329
00:37:48.548 --> 00:37:50.091
Yelena.

330
00:37:52.428 --> 00:37:55.389
Welcome to the Xander zone.

331
00:37:55.974 --> 00:37:58.643
Now, that's funny. That's funny.

332
00:37:58.978 --> 00:38:00.813
Sit down, Mr. Cage.

333
00:38:00.938 --> 00:38:02.606
My friends call me X.

334
00:38:02.941 --> 00:38:05.570
So, X, what exactly are you wanting?

335
00:38:06.946 --> 00:38:11.117
Ferraris, high-end pasta rockets,
10 to start.

336
00:38:14.079 --> 00:38:18.417
This car, number 10, will be very
difficult to find in Europe.

337
00:38:18.626 --> 00:38:23.924
That one's for me. I put it in there
to get something out of the deal.

338
00:38:24.092 --> 00:38:25.593
Well, you certainly know your cars.

339
00:38:25.969 --> 00:38:29.389
Yeah. Cars, bikes, boards. You name it.

340
00:38:29.598 --> 00:38:32.643
I like anything fast enough
to do something stupid in.

341
00:38:32.977 --> 00:38:33.937
Yes.

342
00:38:34.146 --> 00:38:38.567
Ten cars is hardly worth the effort.
A lousy 1 .5 million, U.S.

343
00:38:39.152 --> 00:38:41.154
Now, hold on a second.

344
00:38:41.363 --> 00:38:46.493
The American buyers I represent,
to them, 10 cars is an appetizer.

345
00:38:46.661 --> 00:38:50.458
And it's a mil max, sister.
- How about a million four?

346
00:38:50.666 --> 00:38:53.961
I was thinking more like a mil two.

347
00:38:56.423 --> 00:38:59.051
Do you know what a wire transfer is?

348
00:38:59.426 --> 00:39:00.886
Is she for real?

349
00:39:01.012 --> 00:39:03.849
Sweetheart, is there anything
you need to do?

350
00:39:03.974 --> 00:39:07.060
Let us big boys have a conversation.

351
00:39:07.353 --> 00:39:09.939
"Conversation," a word
with four syllables.

352
00:39:10.106 --> 00:39:13.109
Do you want some ice
before your brain overheats?

353
00:39:13.402 --> 00:39:18.492
Ice. Yeah, you could chisel some off
your heart, if you could find it.

354
00:39:23.498 --> 00:39:28.503
This would work a lot faster, princess,
if I had an account number.

355
00:39:32.426 --> 00:39:37.181
You have 48 hours
to complete the transfer.

356
00:39:37.432 --> 00:39:40.185
Don't waste my time.
- I wouldn't dream of it.

357
00:39:41.061 --> 00:39:46.192
I might throw in a couple extra
bucks and send you to charm school.

358
00:39:51.449 --> 00:39:54.452
Now that business is finished,
we party.

359
00:39:57.123 --> 00:39:59.041
Bitches, come!

360
00:40:25.658 --> 00:40:26.909
Yeah?

361
00:40:32.332 --> 00:40:34.960
Shit, I thought this was a cell phone.

362
00:40:35.127 --> 00:40:36.128
Have a nice rest?

363
00:40:36.754 --> 00:40:39.216
Dial it down.
I got to sleep an hour ago.

364
00:40:39.341 --> 00:40:43.554
You were given a specific list of cars.
Who told you to alter it?

365
00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:46.641
The cars sucked.
They would've seen through it.

366
00:40:46.767 --> 00:40:49.561
You guys should switch travel agents.

367
00:40:50.104 --> 00:40:52.106
I got that info you wanted.

368
00:40:52.273 --> 00:40:54.234
Hang on a second.

369
00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:56.945
You guys ready for this?

370
00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:05.330
Names, birthdays,
ranks in the Red Army.

371
00:41:05.623 --> 00:41:07.960
Favorite foods? How did you get this?

372
00:41:08.127 --> 00:41:12.089
Kolya, Yorgi's younger brother,
happens to be an action sports fanatic.

373
00:41:12.256 --> 00:41:13.924
So naturally, he's a fan.

374
00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:17.637
But when you kill a bottle of vodka
in three swigs, you'll talk.

375
00:41:17.971 --> 00:41:19.931
I got something else.
- What?

376
00:41:20.057 --> 00:41:23.937
Their personal bank account number.
Where did I put that?

377
00:41:28.693 --> 00:41:32.155
Stolen cars, nightclubs, prostitution,
extortion.

378
00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:35.993
What's the big deal?
We got criminals like this in the U.S.

379
00:41:36.161 --> 00:41:38.413
Your job isn't to ask questions.

380
00:41:38.664 --> 00:41:42.626
Well, I did my job, thank you.
I'm coming home.

381
00:41:43.002 --> 00:41:44.128
Not just yet.

382
00:41:44.254 --> 00:41:48.968
You're a victim of your own success.
Get closer to these guys.

383
00:41:49.052 --> 00:41:52.222
They're cool, but not that cool.
- Go deeper.

384
00:41:52.389 --> 00:41:55.142
I'll send a guy with a care package
to help you.

385
00:41:55.226 --> 00:42:00.023
I thought we had a deal.
- You change cars, I change the deal.

386
00:42:00.148 --> 00:42:02.275
Do this for me, you can come home.

387
00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:07.949
If you send someone to save the world,
make sure they like it the way it is.

388
00:42:18.963 --> 00:42:23.176
I have a really firm chest.
I bench, like, 225.

389
00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:26.180
Like, bench. Weight room. Bye.

390
00:42:26.263 --> 00:42:30.727
That's him.
- Wait. You're Triple X?

391
00:42:31.062 --> 00:42:34.649
You're the care package?
- Agent Toby Lee Shavers.

392
00:42:34.774 --> 00:42:36.108
Come on.

393
00:42:36.276 --> 00:42:39.738
You have to rate high
to get Gibbons to send this stuff.

394
00:42:40.072 --> 00:42:44.995
I kind of wish I was going with you,
mixed up in the fury of the situation.

395
00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:48.248
Crazy. License to kill,
death, destruction, mayhem.

396
00:42:48.374 --> 00:42:53.338
Got a gun under your pillow. Never know
when some freak villain will pop out.

397
00:42:55.090 --> 00:42:57.175
How long you been with the agency?
- Two days.

398
00:42:57.343 --> 00:42:59.972
You're shitting me. No way.

399
00:43:00.139 --> 00:43:02.141
That sucks.

400
00:43:02.725 --> 00:43:04.977
Yeah, it sucks, but it beats jail.

401
00:43:05.145 --> 00:43:07.272
It sucks because I spent six years

402
00:43:07.439 --> 00:43:12.111
in the basement of some windowless,
NSA, gadget freak room, man.

403
00:43:12.236 --> 00:43:14.698
And I got a degree.
I got a degree from MIT.

404
00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:17.743
Phi Beta Kappa, magna cum laude.

405
00:43:17.994 --> 00:43:22.707
And they probably picked you up,
what, pumping iron in San Quentin?

406
00:43:22.999 --> 00:43:26.252
You ever get punched in the face
for talking too much?

407
00:43:26.337 --> 00:43:27.672
Show me the stuff.

408
00:43:29.007 --> 00:43:32.427
This one made my career,
the definition of perfection:

409
00:43:32.678 --> 00:43:36.140
My multi-purpose, multi-function
field revolver.

410
00:43:39.186 --> 00:43:41.481
I like this.
- Then you'll love these.

411
00:43:41.773 --> 00:43:45.151
These are all attachment darts.
See the green ones?

412
00:43:45.402 --> 00:43:47.362
Datura knockout darts.

413
00:43:47.488 --> 00:43:51.450
Guy goes down for 12 hours, wakes
up, doesn't know who he is,

414
00:43:51.785 --> 00:43:55.123
and his head's splitting
like a cord of firewood.

415
00:43:55.373 --> 00:43:58.209
I was shot twice by those.

416
00:43:58.377 --> 00:44:01.964
And the red ones are tranquilizer
and blood-splatter darts.

417
00:44:02.048 --> 00:44:06.010
Looks like a kill shot
without the aftereffects. Like death.

418
00:44:06.136 --> 00:44:08.513
You've got exploding and
surveillance darts,

419
00:44:08.931 --> 00:44:13.060
and your standard .44-caliber
bullets, if you want to get nasty.

420
00:44:13.729 --> 00:44:17.233
A little wet work. You know
what I'm talking about, right?

421
00:44:21.529 --> 00:44:23.740
Knocked over a few 7-Elevens, have we?

422
00:44:24.075 --> 00:44:29.080
No, I had my leg in a cast for three
months. All I did was play video games.

423
00:44:29.206 --> 00:44:31.041
That's a really sad story.

424
00:44:31.208 --> 00:44:33.335
Check this out, on to my baby.

425
00:44:36.089 --> 00:44:38.718
Eagle Eyes. Nine enhanced-vision modes.

426
00:44:39.093 --> 00:44:43.097
Every little boy's dream:
the penetrator mode.

427
00:44:43.265 --> 00:44:44.391
Check it out.

428
00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:55.487
My God.

429
00:44:55.613 --> 00:44:59.242
She's checking you out, man.
- I'll hang on to these.

430
00:44:59.576 --> 00:45:01.995
Now, on to my latest achievement.

431
00:45:02.246 --> 00:45:05.500
I just put the finishing touches
on them last week.

432
00:45:06.252 --> 00:45:07.962
What do you think?

433
00:45:08.212 --> 00:45:11.132
Bandages?
- No, Mr. X, watch and learn.

434
00:45:11.257 --> 00:45:14.343
There's enough primer
to blow a hole in a vault

435
00:45:14.469 --> 00:45:18.390
vaporize a human, or whatever agents
like you might find a use for.

436
00:45:18.976 --> 00:45:20.310
And check this out.

437
00:45:20.436 --> 00:45:23.022
The detonator. How cool is that?

438
00:45:25.984 --> 00:45:29.154
You might want to back up for this.
- It's a bandage.

439
00:45:29.488 --> 00:45:31.490
Just get behind the wall.

440
00:45:33.327 --> 00:45:34.620
You ready?

441
00:45:34.995 --> 00:45:37.122
I've always wanted to say this.

442
00:45:38.499 --> 00:45:40.084
Fire in the hole.

443
00:46:02.988 --> 00:46:05.073
It's loaded.

444
00:46:26.683 --> 00:46:30.646
So, what do you think? Beautiful.

445
00:46:31.523 --> 00:46:33.567
You like the cars?

446
00:46:34.526 --> 00:46:37.195
I love the cars, they're dope.

447
00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:42.201
You like the money?
- I love money, but I do not have it.

448
00:46:42.285 --> 00:46:46.666
You look like you're doing very well.
All these employees, beautiful cars.

449
00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:49.294
This is no time for being funny.

450
00:47:02.519 --> 00:47:07.483
You didn't think I wasn't good for it?
- It never crossed my mind.

451
00:47:10.111 --> 00:47:14.116
A cargo ship's waiting for you
in Rijeka. Here's the address.

452
00:47:17.162 --> 00:47:18.371
This place is dope.

453
00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:21.708
This one's mine?

454
00:47:22.126 --> 00:47:23.502
Car number 10.

455
00:47:24.086 --> 00:47:27.674
Kolya found it hiding in Berlin.
It was very difficult to find.

456
00:47:28.134 --> 00:47:29.510
No! Please.

457
00:47:29.635 --> 00:47:33.097
Allow me. You were kind enough
to give me the money.

458
00:47:41.358 --> 00:47:42.609
Now, please

459
00:47:43.152 --> 00:47:44.570
drive.

460
00:47:49.242 --> 00:47:50.535
No, allow me.

461
00:48:03.176 --> 00:48:07.265
You're all right, Yorgi.
- Everything's all right with vodka.

462
00:48:07.724 --> 00:48:11.645
You must come to party tonight.
Big party at one of my clubs.

463
00:48:12.271 --> 00:48:13.355
Yeah?
- Yes.

464
00:48:33.546 --> 00:48:35.632
What's going on, my friend?

465
00:48:35.758 --> 00:48:39.303
You tell me.
You got a sniper up there or what?

466
00:48:39.429 --> 00:48:41.639
He's not with us, he must be with you.

467
00:48:41.765 --> 00:48:44.768
Bullshit! Tell your men to get down,

468
00:48:45.228 --> 00:48:48.733
or I'll give you another hole to
breathe out of. Are we clear?

469
00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:57.242
All right. It's not yours.

470
00:48:57.368 --> 00:48:59.412
Let's go and get him together.

471
00:49:33.245 --> 00:49:35.998
Son of a bitch.
That same cop from the club.

472
00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:37.708
Filthy cop.

473
00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:11.541
Most people talk a lot.
Few are up for the moment.

474
00:50:12.335 --> 00:50:15.088
Welcome to Anarchy 99.

475
00:51:07.106 --> 00:51:10.652
Did you enjoy that?
- Yeah.

476
00:51:10.945 --> 00:51:13.948
Good, because it will
never happen again.

477
00:51:40.264 --> 00:51:41.974
After you.
- No, after you.

478
00:51:42.099 --> 00:51:44.935
No, after you.
- No, I insist.

479
00:51:50.193 --> 00:51:51.194
That's it.

480
00:51:53.947 --> 00:51:56.199
Last chance to tuck me in.

481
00:51:58.035 --> 00:51:59.453
Good morning.

482
00:53:28.335 --> 00:53:31.588
It's none of my business, but a power
drill and some titanium bits

483
00:53:31.714 --> 00:53:33.424
will get you a lot further than that
camera.

484
00:53:33.674 --> 00:53:36.010
You're not supposed to be in here.

485
00:53:36.135 --> 00:53:38.179
I was on my way to the bathroom.

486
00:53:40.682 --> 00:53:42.643
What's your excuse?

487
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:45.230
I don't need an excuse.

488
00:53:48.109 --> 00:53:49.402
You're good.

489
00:53:51.112 --> 00:53:52.947
But not that good.

490
00:53:53.073 --> 00:53:56.286
I came in here to photograph
Yorgi's safe.

491
00:53:56.411 --> 00:53:59.164
I thought it might be worth
a lot to somebody.

492
00:53:59.331 --> 00:54:03.127
Come on. You're cold,
intelligent and vicious.

493
00:54:05.171 --> 00:54:07.215
It's your eyes that give you away.

494
00:54:08.466 --> 00:54:11.178
They gave you away
when I shot that cop.

495
00:54:13.974 --> 00:54:15.767
What are you going to do now?

496
00:54:20.064 --> 00:54:22.692
Now I'm going to take you to lunch.

497
00:54:24.445 --> 00:54:28.074
And that cop I shot, isn't dead.

498
00:54:48.557 --> 00:54:51.185
I have some information for you.

499
00:54:53.064 --> 00:54:58.028
I can always use information. Who
is this? How did you get this number?

500
00:54:59.071 --> 00:55:04.285
Yes. Important information
that you need about Xander Cage.

501
00:55:14.464 --> 00:55:18.718
So you don't like foreigners, do you?
- No, you're a pig.

502
00:55:20.138 --> 00:55:22.182
Is your boyfriend a pig too?

503
00:55:22.308 --> 00:55:25.019
You should recognize one of your kind.

504
00:55:25.144 --> 00:55:27.062
Now, tell me about the cop.

505
00:55:29.191 --> 00:55:32.569
What if I told you I'm not
who you think I am?

506
00:55:34.114 --> 00:55:36.074
That I could get you out of
the mess you're in?

507
00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:38.410
Really? And what mess am I in?

508
00:55:38.536 --> 00:55:43.583
The mess that makes you sneak around
the castle when everyone's asleep.

509
00:55:44.042 --> 00:55:45.043
The cop?

510
00:55:48.215 --> 00:55:52.052
See this?
It's called a blood-splatter dart.

511
00:55:52.136 --> 00:55:56.349
The impact's real, but it's harmless.
Red paint, mostly.

512
00:55:58.268 --> 00:55:59.227
Why?

513
00:56:01.188 --> 00:56:02.565
I'm a secret agent.

514
00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:12.284
Are you sure you don't want
to embarrass me?

515
00:56:13.036 --> 00:56:15.331
Come on.
- What's so funny about that?

516
00:56:17.041 --> 00:56:19.210
I mean, look at you.

517
00:56:19.419 --> 00:56:22.047
I work for the NSA.

518
00:56:24.508 --> 00:56:26.552
You're funny, you know that?

519
00:56:30.683 --> 00:56:32.476
Yelena, it's Kirill.

520
00:56:33.186 --> 00:56:37.023
Yorgi found out that Cage
is an American agent.

521
00:56:37.524 --> 00:56:42.446
Do you understand what I'm telling you?
You are in danger, my love.

522
00:56:43.282 --> 00:56:46.035
The building across the street.
The statue.

523
00:56:47.328 --> 00:56:50.456
Bring him outside. I will do the rest.

524
00:56:57.383 --> 00:56:59.552
What was that, your boyfriend?

525
00:57:05.684 --> 00:57:09.354
Let's say you are who you say you are.

526
00:57:11.107 --> 00:57:14.153
What can you do for me?
- What do you want?

527
00:57:15.404 --> 00:57:20.660
I want immunity from prosecution,
asylum in the U.S. and citizenship.

528
00:57:21.203 --> 00:57:23.455
How about a condo on South Beach
and a rich boyfriend?

529
00:57:23.581 --> 00:57:25.626
Those I can get for myself.

530
00:57:27.211 --> 00:57:30.339
What do you want?
- I need to know more about Anarchy 99.

531
00:57:30.590 --> 00:57:33.092
You want to know about Anarchy 99?

532
00:57:33.635 --> 00:57:37.222
You've seen the girls,
the clubs, the parties.

533
00:57:37.389 --> 00:57:41.186
What you don't see
is what goes on during the day.

534
00:57:41.603 --> 00:57:46.650
There's been a lot of activity in the
last year. People coming in and out.

535
00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:50.697
Russian scientists.
- Well, what are they up to?

536
00:57:51.365 --> 00:57:54.411
They go in the basement
and I'm not allowed in.

537
00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:57.748
Now's a good time for you
to get invited.

538
00:57:58.374 --> 00:58:04.380
Yorgi knows you're an agent.
Kirill is waiting with his rifle.

539
00:58:10.389 --> 00:58:11.723
Where--?
- Don't look!

540
00:58:13.142 --> 00:58:15.102
There's a back door.

541
00:58:15.269 --> 00:58:17.354
They'll know you warned me.

542
00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:21.109
If you go out the front,
he'll put a bullet in your eye.

543
00:58:31.581 --> 00:58:34.334
You still packing?
- Always.

544
00:58:34.542 --> 00:58:36.420
Get ready to use it.

545
00:58:39.466 --> 00:58:42.469
What's your plan?
- He's still in love with you.

546
00:58:42.636 --> 00:58:48.142
He'll wait for a clear shot.
- That's your plan? Thank you. Great.

547
00:59:12.381 --> 00:59:13.382
Draw!

548
01:00:03.193 --> 01:00:04.778
He's on the way.

549
01:00:42.617 --> 01:00:47.289
Gibbons! My favorite kidnapper.
Next time send a limo.

550
01:00:54.506 --> 01:00:56.592
You've got to be kidding me.

551
01:00:56.801 --> 01:01:00.763
You already broke me.
No need to get cruel and unusual.

552
01:01:04.518 --> 01:01:06.520
A ticket? Now, that's funny.

553
01:01:06.687 --> 01:01:09.357
Where am I going to go now?
- Home.

554
01:01:10.234 --> 01:01:11.235
Home?

555
01:01:11.527 --> 01:01:13.654
Your cover's blown. You're not useful.

556
01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:15.323
That's it? I'm done?

557
01:01:15.448 --> 01:01:18.993
No tricks. We have enough intel
to move forward.

558
01:01:19.328 --> 01:01:24.084
With what?
- Sweeper team: quick, clean, effective.

559
01:01:24.376 --> 01:01:27.296
Don't worry about it.
It'll all be over soon.

560
01:01:27.714 --> 01:01:31.092
You mean a sweeper team
to come in and kill everybody?

561
01:01:31.384 --> 01:01:34.053
Not all of them are as bad
as you think.

562
01:01:34.346 --> 01:01:38.309
You had to shoot a cop. How
"not as bad as I think" could they be?

563
01:01:38.477 --> 01:01:40.562
Okay, look.

564
01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:44.526
We've got a complication.
There's a girl. Yelena.

565
01:01:44.693 --> 01:01:46.361
There's always a girl.

566
01:01:46.445 --> 01:01:50.491
She wants out and I sent her back in
to get more intel for you.

567
01:01:50.616 --> 01:01:54.621
There's no time to play favorites.
The cards have been dealt.

568
01:01:54.788 --> 01:01:57.541
What do you mean
the cards have been dealt?

569
01:01:57.667 --> 01:01:59.794
You don't even know her, man.

570
01:02:01.546 --> 01:02:05.009
By the way, that bank number
you gave us?

571
01:02:05.635 --> 01:02:11.391
Your friends and Yelena have made
some large cash transfers

572
01:02:11.517 --> 01:02:15.688
to a group of Russian scientists
known to specialize and traffic

573
01:02:15.772 --> 01:02:18.525
in biological weapons.

574
01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:22.071
She had nothing to do with it.
- Go home.

575
01:02:22.155 --> 01:02:24.073
She ain't--!
- That's an order.

576
01:02:44.557 --> 01:02:45.516
How's it going?

577
01:02:45.642 --> 01:02:46.852
Life is shit!

578
01:02:47.145 --> 01:02:49.063
Yeah, well what can you do?

579
01:04:42.661 --> 01:04:45.789
Through this door,
you are with us to the end.

580
01:04:45.956 --> 01:04:49.293
Are you sure that's what you want?
- I'm sure.

581
01:06:29.291 --> 01:06:33.880
This is Ahab. Think of it as
solar-powered submarine.

582
01:06:34.256 --> 01:06:37.176
It can circumnavigate the globe
to reach its target.

583
01:06:37.343 --> 01:06:42.265
It need only surface to gather sunshine
and to do its business.

584
01:06:42.682 --> 01:06:45.311
What is it? What's its business?

585
01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:50.859
Dropping off presents to all
the good little boys and girls.

586
01:07:00.371 --> 01:07:03.374
My team will be finished tomorrow.

587
01:07:04.126 --> 01:07:05.085
How about you?

588
01:07:06.128 --> 01:07:08.839
We're finished now.

589
01:07:40.796 --> 01:07:41.755
Nikolai!

590
01:07:42.173 --> 01:07:44.133
Bring the rockets.

591
01:08:21.345 --> 01:08:24.224
The detonator is for you.

592
01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.412
Yorgi! The binary agents are mixing

593
01:09:16.496 --> 01:09:18.541
it will kill us all!

594
01:09:28.844 --> 01:09:31.388
Looks like little white mouse.

595
01:09:34.894 --> 01:09:36.646
Bye-bye, little mouse.

596
01:09:54.501 --> 01:09:55.919
My God.

597
01:10:57.495 --> 01:11:01.499
They did their job
and now they were liability.

598
01:11:02.459 --> 01:11:06.255
We don't need anyone
talking about our business.

599
01:11:11.554 --> 01:11:16.309
The gas gets sucked through the
extractor fans, passed into water,

600
01:11:16.435 --> 01:11:20.356
and broken down to become,
once again, completely harmless.

601
01:11:24.278 --> 01:11:26.196
So quiet.

602
01:11:29.159 --> 01:11:32.704
I know now why they call it
Silent Night.

603
01:11:41.507 --> 01:11:42.925
Let's get some food.

604
01:12:18.344 --> 01:12:20.263
Find out what's going on!

605
01:12:54.513 --> 01:12:55.639
What the hell was that?

606
01:13:02.357 --> 01:13:03.691
That works.

607
01:14:30.882 --> 01:14:32.425
Fire in the hole.

608
01:15:01.711 --> 01:15:04.672
Sova. What are you doing here, man?

609
01:15:04.756 --> 01:15:08.386
First you set me up in the bar.
Then you shoot me in the back.

610
01:15:08.553 --> 01:15:11.973
My boss does it to me.
I did it to you. It's a vicious circle.

611
01:15:12.474 --> 01:15:13.934
You think it's funny?
- No.

612
01:15:14.351 --> 01:15:16.812
You didn't take it personally, did you?

613
01:15:17.021 --> 01:15:20.733
I did what I had to do to get in.
We're on the same side.

614
01:15:20.901 --> 01:15:23.822
I'm sorry. I switched sides.

615
01:15:24.489 --> 01:15:28.785
You pushed me too far. My government
doesn't pay as well as Yorgi.

616
01:15:29.745 --> 01:15:31.914
My government pays twice as much--

617
01:15:32.373 --> 01:15:34.875
Think you could just walk
into the spy business,

618
01:15:35.043 --> 01:15:40.466
and have all the angles figured out?
- What are you going to do, shoot me?

619
01:15:40.592 --> 01:15:42.594
Where? In the head, to be quick?

620
01:15:42.719 --> 01:15:45.972
Or in the chest for an open casket,
so I can see your heart?

621
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:48.392
Can I think about it?

622
01:15:56.445 --> 01:15:57.696
What are you doing?!

623
01:15:57.821 --> 01:16:01.700
I heard you talking. I could tell
where you were in the room.

624
01:16:03.454 --> 01:16:05.790
What are you doing with the lvans?

625
01:16:09.794 --> 01:16:10.878
What's going on?

626
01:16:10.962 --> 01:16:14.591
There's something I didn't
have the time to tell you.

627
01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.760
I'm an agent as well.

628
01:16:16.969 --> 01:16:20.515
I'm an agent for FSB,
Russian lntelligence.

629
01:16:20.641 --> 01:16:22.685
You know, like your CIA.

630
01:16:22.810 --> 01:16:25.771
I've been undercover for two years.
- Two years?

631
01:16:25.939 --> 01:16:28.775
What was your plan,
let them die of old age?

632
01:16:28.901 --> 01:16:30.444
There was no plan.

633
01:16:30.569 --> 01:16:34.991
A year ago, lntelligence gets
reorganized, I stop getting orders.

634
01:16:35.576 --> 01:16:39.997
They forget about me. And I did what
I must to survive. You understand?

635
01:16:40.457 --> 01:16:43.627
What do I understand?
I've been an agent for a week.

636
01:16:43.794 --> 01:16:46.756
But my boss needs to know
what we know now.

637
01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:49.718
Okay?
- Okay.

638
01:16:50.803 --> 01:16:54.849
The submarine's purpose is to deploy
a nerve agent called Silent Night.

639
01:16:55.016 --> 01:16:58.269
It's been missing since
the Soviet Union's collapse in '91.

640
01:16:58.478 --> 01:16:59.772
It can kill millions.

641
01:16:59.856 --> 01:17:02.942
We knew they were up to something.
You found out.

642
01:17:03.235 --> 01:17:07.489
That's excellent work, Triple X.
- There was never a sweeper team.

643
01:17:08.866 --> 01:17:11.869
If I said don't jump off
the Empire State Building...

644
01:17:12.037 --> 01:17:15.542
You're right. I'd definitely do it.
- I inspired you.

645
01:17:15.667 --> 01:17:19.045
I'm an authority figure,
that's what I'm supposed to do.

646
01:17:19.463 --> 01:17:21.465
Look, my men are on this now.

647
01:17:21.632 --> 01:17:24.885
It's time for you to come home.
- What about Yelena?

648
01:17:28.349 --> 01:17:31.519
I'm not authorized to give her asylum.

649
01:17:32.854 --> 01:17:35.982
But I promise it'll be done
by the time you get here.

650
01:17:37.568 --> 01:17:40.613
Come home, Xander. That's an order.

651
01:17:57.552 --> 01:18:00.221
How soon can Yorgi launch this thing?

652
01:18:03.892 --> 01:18:07.229
You were told to go home!
Your people are handling--

653
01:18:07.563 --> 01:18:09.357
How soon, Yelena?

654
01:18:11.861 --> 01:18:14.572
Soon. But it's not our problem anymore!

655
01:18:14.739 --> 01:18:17.659
If they get ahead of schedule,
it's everyone's.

656
01:18:17.743 --> 01:18:21.997
He's got an army, a fortress.
You don't stand a chance!

657
01:18:22.248 --> 01:18:26.962
I've risked my life for stupid reasons.
This is the first one that makes sense.

658
01:18:27.296 --> 01:18:31.801
This is not one of your stunts.
You'll die in this, you know that.

659
01:18:34.263 --> 01:18:36.682
If you don't go back in there

660
01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:40.896
he'll know something's wrong.

661
01:18:41.021 --> 01:18:44.858
You can't ask me to go back there.
You can't.

662
01:18:47.779 --> 01:18:52.660
You want to know something ironic?
I volunteered for this assignment.

663
01:18:53.954 --> 01:18:56.790
I wanted to make a difference.

664
01:18:57.834 --> 01:18:59.544
I fought for it.

665
01:19:03.298 --> 01:19:04.632
Then finish it.

666
01:19:22.322 --> 01:19:25.575
Remember what I told you,
after you kissed me?

667
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:28.579
Never again?
- I lied.

668
01:19:46.978 --> 01:19:50.315
But when you break it down,
I'm a simple man.

669
01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:52.692
I'd be happy with a beautiful
Czech girl--

670
01:19:52.818 --> 01:19:56.780
Hey, geek!
Got new orders from Gibbons. Get in.

671
01:20:01.787 --> 01:20:04.999
I want all that in here.
- Done.

672
01:20:05.291 --> 01:20:08.711
The castle's covered
with surveillance cameras.

673
01:20:09.755 --> 01:20:12.341
That's why we cannot get close enough.

674
01:20:14.761 --> 01:20:20.059
Hang on. That's why I need to
knock out the communications tower

675
01:20:20.393 --> 01:20:22.395
at the base of the mountain.

676
01:20:28.027 --> 01:20:31.281
Is there anyone here
who knows how to fly a plane?

677
01:20:32.491 --> 01:20:33.867
I can.

678
01:20:41.043 --> 01:20:43.797
Too much turbulence
around these mountains!

679
01:20:43.922 --> 01:20:46.675
Just get me in line with that tower!

680
01:20:46.801 --> 01:20:48.386
I'll do the rest!

681
01:21:02.027 --> 01:21:02.986
Go now!

682
01:22:25.088 --> 01:22:26.506
Viktor! We got company!

683
01:22:31.387 --> 01:22:34.390
Catch him fast. Kill him slow!

684
01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:26.717
Nothing like fresh powder.

685
01:27:03.637 --> 01:27:07.725
Yelena, my sweet dove,
did you get confused?

686
01:27:08.184 --> 01:27:12.856
Your assignment was to kill the cop
after he killed X.

687
01:27:13.899 --> 01:27:18.446
Not good for undercover agent
from Russian lntelligence.

688
01:27:22.911 --> 01:27:25.914
I knew about you all along,

689
01:27:26.164 --> 01:27:31.421
and it was my pleasure to twist
you and use you how I saw fit.

690
01:27:33.173 --> 01:27:34.466
And you.

691
01:27:39.472 --> 01:27:42.226
Of all people,
I thought you'd understand

692
01:27:42.519 --> 01:27:44.771
what I'm trying to accomplish.

693
01:27:45.439 --> 01:27:47.232
Can you imagine?

694
01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:50.903
Imagine a city like Prague vanishing

695
01:27:51.237 --> 01:27:54.198
in a cloud of poison gas.

696
01:27:54.449 --> 01:27:57.703
Then Hamburg, London, Washington.

697
01:27:58.204 --> 01:28:03.543
Imagine not knowing who did it, or why.
And so they turn on each other.

698
01:28:03.794 --> 01:28:07.756
These guys attack those guys.
Those guys invade these guys.

699
01:28:07.882 --> 01:28:10.844
Soon, whole world implodes.

700
01:28:10.970 --> 01:28:14.432
Imagine governments disappearing.

701
01:28:14.516 --> 01:28:16.393
And in the end

702
01:28:16.518 --> 01:28:20.898
imagine facing absolute,
beautiful freedom.

703
01:28:25.613 --> 01:28:28.741
But neither of you will be there
to see it.

704
01:28:30.827 --> 01:28:32.829
Like Viktor.

705
01:28:35.833 --> 01:28:37.543
Like Kolya.

706
01:29:24.018 --> 01:29:25.728
Cover me!

707
01:29:35.407 --> 01:29:37.492
Get me out of this thing!

708
01:29:41.622 --> 01:29:44.834
He took the hard drive.
He's going to launch Ahab!

709
01:29:50.884 --> 01:29:52.719
Pick one.

710
01:30:03.441 --> 01:30:04.859
Ivan, take out that nest!

711
01:30:25.843 --> 01:30:27.803
You have to turn the safety off.

712
01:30:51.833 --> 01:30:53.960
Hold them off as long as you can.

713
01:30:55.796 --> 01:30:57.714
See you, my friend.

714
01:31:54.202 --> 01:31:55.954
Come on, baby.

715
01:32:04.714 --> 01:32:07.675
Stop! He's got us pinned down.

716
01:32:11.598 --> 01:32:12.891
Shit.

717
01:32:13.141 --> 01:32:14.851
You got a bazooka!

718
01:32:14.977 --> 01:32:19.148
Stop thinking Prague police and start
thinking PlayStation. Blow shit up!

719
01:32:19.607 --> 01:32:22.945
This is not bazooka.
This is heat-seeker rocket.

720
01:32:25.657 --> 01:32:26.908
Heat-seeker?

721
01:32:28.243 --> 01:32:29.577
Set it.

722
01:32:33.916 --> 01:32:36.586
The son of a bitch is smoking.

723
01:32:53.149 --> 01:32:56.069
I told him that cigarette
would kill him one day.

724
01:33:57.102 --> 01:33:59.271
Learn how to shoot, piece of shit!

725
01:34:25.011 --> 01:34:27.305
Quick! Help me pull him out!

726
01:34:31.978 --> 01:34:34.147
It will hit the city in 30 minutes!

727
01:34:48.916 --> 01:34:51.252
Guys. I need a helicopter.

728
01:34:52.128 --> 01:34:54.297
I need transportation. I need a--

729
01:35:01.473 --> 01:35:05.018
X, there you are.
I gave you everything you wanted.

730
01:35:05.185 --> 01:35:07.270
This thing will damn near fly now.

731
01:35:07.563 --> 01:35:10.484
You screwed me.
Gibbons didn't authorize this.

732
01:35:10.776 --> 01:35:12.486
He'll hang us both out to dry.

733
01:35:12.778 --> 01:35:14.530
Agent Shavers.
- Yeah?

734
01:35:14.906 --> 01:35:17.575
I'm going to give you
a field promotion.

735
01:35:17.826 --> 01:35:21.163
Take over, finish the mop-up.
You're in charge.

736
01:35:21.956 --> 01:35:25.878
Yes, sir! I'm the man for the job!
I won't let you down!

737
01:35:27.004 --> 01:35:28.630
Wait! Wait! Wait!

738
01:35:29.173 --> 01:35:31.008
Almost forgot the manual. You'll need
this.

739
01:35:31.176 --> 01:35:33.929
Hey, X. Go kick some ass.

740
01:35:54.913 --> 01:35:58.875
That thing must be going 80 mph!
How do we stop it?!

741
01:35:59.043 --> 01:36:03.089
We can't! The controls
are on the bubble panel.

742
01:36:03.215 --> 01:36:05.008
You see it?
- Yeah.

743
01:36:05.133 --> 01:36:07.303
The hard drive's in there!

744
01:36:07.554 --> 01:36:11.975
You got the manual. See if Shavers
put in anything we could use.

745
01:36:12.059 --> 01:36:15.062
He's got very bad handwriting.
- Come on!

746
01:36:15.521 --> 01:36:20.694
Flame throwers, mini-bombs, exploding
hubcaps, rocket launchers!

747
01:36:21.237 --> 01:36:24.991
This is a tank.
You can't use any of it on Ahab.

748
01:36:25.117 --> 01:36:28.704
Silent Night only breaks down
in deep water.

749
01:36:29.622 --> 01:36:31.874
I'll have to get on it!
- What?

750
01:36:33.210 --> 01:36:35.088
I'll have to get on it.

751
01:36:42.221 --> 01:36:46.934
Our surveillance puts Ahab
22 minutes outside of Prague.

752
01:36:47.102 --> 01:36:51.733
We should evacuate the city.
- 22 minutes for 1 .5 million people?

753
01:36:52.108 --> 01:36:55.695
Call air support. We may need
to blow it out of the water.

754
01:36:56.113 --> 01:36:58.949
-If we hit that thing--
-This city will die.

755
01:36:59.116 --> 01:37:01.160
And the crisis will be contained!

756
01:37:01.287 --> 01:37:03.122
One city's better than 10.

757
01:37:05.667 --> 01:37:09.212
Another thing: A blue GTO
is traveling parallel to Ahab.

758
01:37:20.935 --> 01:37:23.646
Shit! Does this road
go back to the river?

759
01:37:24.064 --> 01:37:26.316
Come on! Check the GPS!

760
01:37:28.152 --> 01:37:31.615
Yes, it does!
Fifteen miles at the town of Davle!

761
01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:52.181
There's got to be something here
we could use.

762
01:37:52.349 --> 01:37:56.353
Harpoon gun, parachutes
built into seats, ejectable roof.

763
01:37:56.645 --> 01:37:58.648
It's all useless!

764
01:38:00.192 --> 01:38:01.526
How far are we?

765
01:38:03.195 --> 01:38:06.198
The river is just beyond
the next village.

766
01:38:15.335 --> 01:38:18.547
I'm going through!
Use the rocket launcher!

767
01:38:18.714 --> 01:38:20.299
Twenty-two!
- Hit it!

768
01:38:24.012 --> 01:38:26.515
That was a flamethrower!
Use the rockets!

769
01:38:26.641 --> 01:38:29.769
It's 32! I told you!
I told you he had bad handwriting!

770
01:38:30.062 --> 01:38:31.146
Hit it!

771
01:39:05.605 --> 01:39:09.318
Shavers loaded this thing.
We're missing something.

772
01:39:09.735 --> 01:39:12.613
There are more weapons
here on the back. Look.

773
01:39:23.169 --> 01:39:27.257
Take the wheel!
- What? You're crazy!

774
01:39:32.054 --> 01:39:33.305
The brake! The brake!

775
01:39:36.268 --> 01:39:37.602
The gas! The gas!

776
01:39:50.744 --> 01:39:52.204
X, what are you doing?

777
01:39:53.122 --> 01:39:54.874
Five minutes to target.

778
01:40:00.297 --> 01:40:02.299
X, talk to me! What are you doing?

779
01:40:02.758 --> 01:40:05.720
You said there was an ejectable roof.
- Right here!

780
01:40:05.888 --> 01:40:07.014
Hit it!

781
01:40:21.156 --> 01:40:23.700
Shit! It's out of range!

782
01:40:23.826 --> 01:40:27.288
There's a bridge! Cross the bridge!
- Okay.

783
01:40:41.931 --> 01:40:43.182
Come on.

784
01:40:46.729 --> 01:40:47.771
Come on!

785
01:40:50.233 --> 01:40:52.652
Got you!
- Yes!

786
01:40:54.238 --> 01:40:57.241
I wish I had a camera!
- What you talking about?

787
01:40:57.408 --> 01:40:59.828
This is gonna be one hell of a trick.

788
01:41:55.355 --> 01:41:56.940
Three minutes to target.

789
01:43:48.911 --> 01:43:50.663
One minute to target.

790
01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:53.290
Move! Move! Move!

791
01:43:54.125 --> 01:43:55.751
Out of the way!

792
01:44:14.818 --> 01:44:15.986
Eyes!

793
01:44:33.006 --> 01:44:34.841
Ten seconds to target.

794
01:44:43.853 --> 01:44:45.187
Target in sight.

795
01:44:45.730 --> 01:44:49.484
Call the jets off.
Tell the jets to stand down!

796
01:45:02.209 --> 01:45:04.795
Welcome to the Xander zone!

797
01:45:45.095 --> 01:45:50.476
Zero contamination level. I understand,
sir. Zero contamination level.

798
01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:03.074
You Yelena?

799
01:46:04.660 --> 01:46:06.120
Mr. Gibbons.

800
01:46:06.997 --> 01:46:09.833
I promised Xander
you could go to America.

801
01:46:10.292 --> 01:46:12.127
I'm a man of my word.

802
01:46:12.295 --> 01:46:15.215
It doesn't make much difference now,
does it?

803
01:46:41.163 --> 01:46:44.291
He's alive! He's alive! Come here!

804
01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:55.806
Get him out of there, double-time.
Go! Move!

805
01:46:57.934 --> 01:47:00.854
Bora Bora!
- What? I can't hear you!

806
01:47:04.192 --> 01:47:05.902
Bora Bora.

807
01:47:31.851 --> 01:47:32.977
You're getting burnt.

808
01:47:38.734 --> 01:47:40.360
Xander, you there ?

809
01:47:41.070 --> 01:47:44.992
I know you're there, Xander. I've got
you here on satellite magnification.

810
01:47:49.247 --> 01:47:52.876
Call me. We got a whole
new thing to talk about.

811
01:47:53.961 --> 01:47:56.171
Something very important has come up.

812
01:47:57.131 --> 01:47:58.758
By the way

813
01:47:59.051 --> 01:48:02.096
you passed the test. The Gibbons test.

814
01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:07.185
You gotta be kidding me.
