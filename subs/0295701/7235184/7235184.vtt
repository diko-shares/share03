00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:04.992
He stole the chip, he's inside.

2
00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:07.858
I see him.

3
00:02:31.254 --> 00:02:32.754
Kirill!

4
00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:35.447
Time to work.

5
00:22:20.707 --> 00:22:25.358
This is the Colombian army!
Give up, you're surrounded!

6
00:24:18.771 --> 00:24:21.490
The guy on the bike,
that's the drug lord!

7
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:22.938
Let's get him!

8
00:26:20.962 --> 00:26:22.634
There he is!

9
00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.449
We toasted his ass!

10
00:32:45.135 --> 00:32:47.153
Idiots! Where is the American agent?

11
00:32:47.155 --> 00:32:48.412
This is him, sir.

12
00:32:49.942 --> 00:32:52.615
We better order another body bag.

13
00:46:04.805 --> 00:46:07.035
It's loaded.

14
01:08:48.724 --> 01:08:50.331
- How's it going?
- Life is shit!

15
01:08:50.333 --> 01:08:52.000
- Yeah, well, what can you do?
- Life is shit!

16
01:13:04.675 --> 01:13:08.325
My team will be finished tomorrow.

17
01:13:08.327 --> 01:13:09.316
How about you?

18
01:13:09.779 --> 01:13:12.577
We're finished now.

19
01:13:46.629 --> 01:13:48.020
Bring the rockets.

20
01:14:25.716 --> 01:14:27.694
The detonator is for you.

21
01:15:17.646 --> 01:15:19.955
Yorgi! The binary agents are mixing.

22
01:15:20.512 --> 01:15:22.628
It will kill us all!

23
01:17:45.588 --> 01:17:47.287
Let's get some food.

24
01:18:58.656 --> 01:18:59.850
What the hell was that?

25
01:28:29.461 --> 01:28:30.780
Viktor! We got company!

26
01:28:35.136 --> 01:28:38.629
Catch him fast. Kill him slow!

27
01:36:07.297 --> 01:36:09.208
Ivan, take out that nest!
