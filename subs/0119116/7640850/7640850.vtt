1
00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:43.212
Ha! Ha!

2
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.553
Come, come!

3
00:02:57.844 --> 00:02:59.266
Please! Please! Please!

4
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:17.160
Aziz. Aziz.

5
00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:22.415
Aziz, light!

6
00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:24.166
Aziz, light.

7
00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:27.750
Good.

8
00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:30.464
We start again.

9
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.267
"When the three planets are in eclipse,
the black hole, like a door, is opened.

10
00:03:36.425 --> 00:03:38.018
Evil comes...

11
00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:40.770
...spreading terror and chaos."

12
00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:44.354
See the snake, Billy? The ultimate evil.

13
00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:47.486
- Make sure you get the snake.
- Yes, I've got your snakes.

14
00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:49.146
I got all the snakes.

15
00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:51.565
So when is this snake act
supposed to occur?

16
00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:55.157
Huh? Well, if this is the five...

17
00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:57.446
...and this is the one...

18
00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:03.952
Every 5000 years.

19
00:04:04.995 --> 00:04:07.919
So I've got some time, then.

20
00:04:15.464 --> 00:04:17.637
Ah, you bring them water.

21
00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:20.181
Good boy. I will take it to them.

22
00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:22.641
Go with God. Be safe from evil.

23
00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:28.068
You see here these
different peoples, or symbols of people...

24
00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:33.403
...gathering together the four elements
of life: water, fire, earth, air...

25
00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:35.283
...around a fifth one.

26
00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:36.864
A fifth...

27
00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:39.033
...element.

28
00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:44.205
Forgive me, lord.

29
00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:46.335
They already know too much.

30
00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:52.088
Ah, Father.

31
00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:55.220
- Yes, how are you today?
- Well, Billy. You have some glasses?

32
00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:57.551
- Of course.
- Father, I'm so glad to see you.

33
00:04:57.714 --> 00:04:59.182
It's the most extraordinary thing.

34
00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:01.719
I mean, look,
it's the greatest find in history.

35
00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:04.058
Yes. You must be parched.

36
00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:07.065
Oh, yes, yes. I'm sorry.

37
00:05:09.768 --> 00:05:11.611
It's like a battle plan.

38
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.740
Here, the good. Here, the evil.

39
00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:19.411
And here, a weapon against evil.

40
00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:23.073
I'm going to be famous.

41
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.414
Then... Then let us...
Let us toast to your fame.

42
00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:28.874
Oh, yes. To fame.

43
00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:30.751
Salute.

44
00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:38.047
You can't drink a toast with water.
Billy, in my sack, the grappa.

45
00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:39.556
Yes.

46
00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:52.477
This I don't understand.
But this...

47
00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:54.112
This could be something...

48
00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:56.277
...prehistoric.

49
00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:57.941
Maybe. I don't know.

50
00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:00.944
But wait.

51
00:06:01.278 --> 00:06:02.621
Here.

52
00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:11.962
Look, look.

53
00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:24.471
They're here.

54
00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.641
This man...

55
00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:34.277
...this perfect being.

56
00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:36.817
I know this is the key. I know it.

57
00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:45.322
This divine light they talk about.

58
00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:47.490
What is divine light?

59
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.167
Aziz, light!

60
00:06:52.162 --> 00:06:54.130
Much better. Thank you, Aziz.

61
00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:12.307
My lord.

62
00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:58.528
Father, this is the most
unbelievable thing I have ever seen.

63
00:07:58.687 --> 00:07:59.904
Don't you think...?

64
00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:04.492
Ah... Ah... Ah...

65
00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:06.745
Are you German?

66
00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:13.081
Lord, I know he was about
to discover everything.

67
00:08:13.243 --> 00:08:16.292
But there is no worry.
I was there in time.

68
00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:19.587
Priest, you and those before you...

69
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:22.127
...have served us well.

70
00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:24.136
But war is coming.

71
00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:27.424
Stones not safe on Earth anymore.

72
00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:46.284
This...

73
00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:48.282
...is really amazing.

74
00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:21.524
The fifth element.

75
00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:25.489
Take the stones.

76
00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:07.232
My lord...

77
00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:11.198
...if you take the weapon, we will be
defenseless when evil returns.

78
00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:15.912
In 300 years, when evil returns...

79
00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:18.042
...so shall we.

80
00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:27.544
Oh, professor.

81
00:10:28.002 --> 00:10:29.094
Professor.

82
00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:37.057
Don't move!

83
00:10:39.013 --> 00:10:40.390
- I have a gun!
- Billy.

84
00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:44.027
Please, understand.
They are our friends.

85
00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:45.402
Friends?

86
00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:48.987
Father, they've killed the professor!
They're monsters!

87
00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:51.072
I'll explain everything. Billy.

88
00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:53.366
- You're with them?
- Billy, look at me.

89
00:10:53.528 --> 00:10:54.780
Look at me. I am your friend.

90
00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:57.369
- No, Father.
- Billy, look at me!

91
00:10:57.532 --> 00:11:01.628
Please, put the gun down.

92
00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:03.254
No.

93
00:11:03.413 --> 00:11:04.881
Billy, no!

94
00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:13.802
Hurry! The wall is closing!

95
00:11:13.965 --> 00:11:15.592
Here is your mission now:

96
00:11:15.758 --> 00:11:19.808
Pass your knowledge to the next priest
as it was passed on to you.

97
00:11:19.971 --> 00:11:23.601
I will do as you command, but please,
hurry, you still have time.

98
00:11:23.766 --> 00:11:25.768
Time not important.

99
00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:28.438
Only life important.

100
00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:44.705
I will fulfill my mission!

101
00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:46.464
You can count on me!

102
00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:53.137
I will pass the knowledge
until your return.

103
00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.293
- Anything yet?
- No, sir.

104
00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:25.795
- Not even a temperature?
- The thermo-analyzers have jammed.

105
00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:28.332
One of them shows a million degrees,
the others minus 5000.

106
00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:30.629
Let's see it.

107
00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:49.022
It's taking shape.

108
00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:09.172
Send out a probe.

109
00:13:10.373 --> 00:13:14.753
Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the Federated Territories.

110
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.054
On air with General Staedert
in 30 seconds.

111
00:13:27.056 --> 00:13:30.230
Oh, I saved this seat for you, Father.

112
00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.989
- President on the line, sir.
- We're in position, Mr. President.

113
00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:38.243
I have to address the Supreme Council
in 10 minutes. Just the facts, general.

114
00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:41.120
There are no results from the chemical
and molecular analysis as yet.

115
00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:42.747
All the calibers are overshot.

116
00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:44.748
We're initiating
a thermonucleatic imaging.

117
00:13:44.907 --> 00:13:47.626
So, what you're saying is,
you don't know what this is.

118
00:13:47.785 --> 00:13:50.129
Not yet, sir. All we know is,
it just keeps getting bigger.

119
00:13:50.288 --> 00:13:51.380
Recommendation?

120
00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:54.588
My philosophy, Mr. President,
is shoot first and ask questions later.

121
00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:57.174
I don't like uninvited guests.

122
00:13:57.337 --> 00:13:59.760
- All right, then, Staedert...
- Mr. President?

123
00:14:00.798 --> 00:14:02.141
Yes?

124
00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.930
Priest Vito Cornelius,
expert of astrophenomenon.

125
00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:10.775
I have a different theory
to offer you, sir.

126
00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:12.610
You have 20 seconds.

127
00:14:19.233 --> 00:14:20.906
Imagine for a moment that this...

128
00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:24.289
...thing is not anything
that can be identified...

129
00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:26.620
...because it prefers not to be.

130
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:30.624
Wherever there is life,
it brings death...

131
00:14:31.621 --> 00:14:35.467
- ...because it is evil. Absolute evil.
- One more reason to shoot first.

132
00:14:35.625 --> 00:14:38.299
Evil begets evil, Mr. President.

133
00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:40.964
Shooting will only make it stronger.

134
00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:47.478
Probe will obtain its objective
in five seconds.

135
00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:53.935
Growth rate is at 27 percent.

136
00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:56.981
Your theory is interesting, but we don't
have time to go into that now.

137
00:14:57.146 --> 00:15:00.650
Time is of no importance,
Mr. President. Only life is important.

138
00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:03.286
You're right.
That's exactly what we're gonna do.

139
00:15:03.444 --> 00:15:06.493
We're gonna protect the life
of some 200 billion of my fellow citizens.

140
00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:08.203
General, you may fire when ready.

141
00:15:08.366 --> 00:15:11.586
Up-front loading of a 120-ZR missile.
Marker lights on the objective.

142
00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:19.506
Its structure has just solidified
on the surface.

143
00:15:19.669 --> 00:15:23.390
I think it's anticipating the attack.
Anticipation denotes intelligence.

144
00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:27.598
The most terrible intelligence imaginable,
Mr. President.

145
00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:32.811
120's loaded.

146
00:15:32.974 --> 00:15:36.695
The ship is in combat formation.
Missiles are loaded, Mr. President.

147
00:15:36.853 --> 00:15:38.696
- Staedert.
- Yes, sir.

148
00:15:38.855 --> 00:15:41.699
- I have a doubt.
- I don't, Mr. President.

149
00:15:51.909 --> 00:15:53.536
Staedert?

150
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.713
What happened?
Staedert, can you hear me?

151
00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:57.715
Staedert? What happened, Staedert?

152
00:15:57.874 --> 00:16:00.343
- Did you destroy it?
- I'm about to, sir.

153
00:16:06.215 --> 00:16:08.968
The planet has increased
in diameter by 200 percent.

154
00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:10.557
It's moving towards the ship.

155
00:16:15.516 --> 00:16:18.235
What...? What do we have
that's bigger than 240?

156
00:16:18.394 --> 00:16:19.737
Nothing, sir.

157
00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:24.318
Staedert, do you hear me?
Get out of there.

158
00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:27.738
I don't want an incident.
Do you hear me, Staedert?

159
00:16:27.904 --> 00:16:31.078
Get out of there.
Can you hear me, Staedert?

160
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.208
Do you understand? Listen.

161
00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:34.914
This is the president.
That's an order.

162
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.299
Do you understand me?
Do you hear me?

163
00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:42.552
Get out of there! Answer me!

164
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.587
Good God!

165
00:17:07.818 --> 00:17:09.616
Four a day.

166
00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:23.467
I'm trying.

167
00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:26.136
To quit is my goal.

168
00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:31.559
Hey, hey, hey.

169
00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:33.219
I'm up.

170
00:17:35.805 --> 00:17:37.307
All right, I'm up.

171
00:17:37.473 --> 00:17:38.816
God.

172
00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:42.316
Yeah. Yeah. Yes?

173
00:17:42.478 --> 00:17:44.731
Hey, dog brain, Finger here.

174
00:17:44.897 --> 00:17:47.070
- Hi, sweetie.
- I love you too, major...

175
00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:49.406
...but you haven't called me that
since basic training.

176
00:17:49.569 --> 00:17:52.743
- I was talking to the cat.
- Oh, yeah, I forgot...

177
00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:55.499
...you still prefer your cat
to the real thing.

178
00:17:55.658 --> 00:17:57.160
At least the cat comes back.

179
00:17:57.326 --> 00:18:00.876
You still pining for that two-timing slut?
There are a million women out there.

180
00:18:01.038 --> 00:18:04.838
I don't want a million women.
I just want one.

181
00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:07.003
The perfect one.

182
00:18:07.169 --> 00:18:11.675
- It don't exist, major.
- Yeah, I know. Ugh.

183
00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:13.843
- What?
- I just found a picture of you.

184
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:15.478
- Oh, how do I look?
- Like shit.

185
00:18:15.636 --> 00:18:17.138
Must be an old picture.

186
00:18:17.305 --> 00:18:20.479
Listen, you gotta bring me your hack
for a six-month overhaul.

187
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:21.858
- Negative.
- ASAP.

188
00:18:22.184 --> 00:18:23.686
I don't need one.

189
00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:27.528
Hey, you forgetting who sat next to you
for 1000 missions? I know how you drive.

190
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:32.196
Finger, I drive a cab now,
not a space fighter.

191
00:18:32.361 --> 00:18:36.036
Okay, so tell me. How many points
you got left on your license?

192
00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:38.371
Major, how many points?

193
00:18:38.534 --> 00:18:39.911
At least 50.

194
00:18:40.077 --> 00:18:42.546
Know what?
You gotta learn how to lie better.

195
00:18:42.705 --> 00:18:44.048
See you tonight.

196
00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:51.256
Welcome to paradise.

197
00:18:51.422 --> 00:18:53.049
Welcome to Fhloston Paradise.

198
00:18:53.215 --> 00:18:56.139
It's Ruby Rhod, your main man,
and I will tell you live at 5...

199
00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:59.602
...the name of the winner of the
super-green Gemini Croquette Contest!

200
00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:02.984
The winner will go with me
for two days to Fhloston Paradise.

201
00:19:03.142 --> 00:19:04.894
So tune in to Radio Cosmos.

202
00:19:05.061 --> 00:19:08.065
Don't watch it all day, sweetie.
It'll rot your brain.

203
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.573
For a perfect world.

204
00:19:14.403 --> 00:19:16.576
- Give me the cash.
- Been here long?

205
00:19:16.739 --> 00:19:19.208
Yeah, long enough.
Come on, give me the cash.

206
00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:22.541
Is that a Z-140? Alleviated titanium.

207
00:19:22.703 --> 00:19:25.422
- Neurocharged assault model.
- Yeah. Yeah.

208
00:19:26.415 --> 00:19:28.042
Good thing for me it's not loaded.

209
00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:32.426
- What do you mean, it's not loaded?
- Well, you have to...

210
00:19:32.922 --> 00:19:35.596
You have to push
that little yellow button to load it.

211
00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:40.604
Take your time.

212
00:19:40.763 --> 00:19:42.606
Oh, God.

213
00:19:43.557 --> 00:19:45.184
You want me to...?

214
00:19:45.351 --> 00:19:46.773
Okay.

215
00:19:48.604 --> 00:19:49.947
There you go.

216
00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:51.608
Give me the cash!

217
00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.032
That's a very dangerous gun.

218
00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:03.453
You know, maybe you better let me
hang on to this one for you, huh?

219
00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:05.664
- You don't mind, do you?
- No.

220
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:09.505
- You sure?
- No. Take it. I don't need it.

221
00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:16.466
That's a very nice hat.

222
00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:17.975
You like it?

223
00:20:18.759 --> 00:20:19.931
God!

224
00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:27.731
Please enter your license.

225
00:20:27.893 --> 00:20:29.987
Yes, yes, just a minute.

226
00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:32.907
Welcome on board, Mr. Dallas.

227
00:20:34.108 --> 00:20:36.952
Good morning. Sleep well?
Yeah, me too.

228
00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:40.164
- I had a horrible nightmare.
- Propulsion 2X4.

229
00:20:44.452 --> 00:20:47.171
You have five points left
on your license.

230
00:20:47.329 --> 00:20:49.832
Yeah, thank you for reminding me.

231
00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:53.127
Have a nice day.

232
00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:55.512
Why not?

233
00:21:04.013 --> 00:21:05.310
You have 48 hours.

234
00:21:05.473 --> 00:21:08.477
That's the length of time it needs
to adapt itself to our living conditions.

235
00:21:08.642 --> 00:21:10.736
- And then?
- And then it will be too late.

236
00:21:10.895 --> 00:21:14.320
The goal of this thing is not
to fight over money or power...

237
00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:19.537
...but to exterminate life.
All forms of life.

238
00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:22.665
So what you're telling me, Father,
there's nothing that can stop this.

239
00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:25.163
There is only one thing.

240
00:21:29.997 --> 00:21:33.672
The Mondoshawan have
the only weapon to defeat evil.

241
00:21:33.834 --> 00:21:35.882
Four elements...

242
00:21:36.504 --> 00:21:38.506
...gathered around a fifth...

243
00:21:38.881 --> 00:21:43.432
...supreme being, the ultimate warrior,
created to protect life.

244
00:21:43.594 --> 00:21:46.689
Together they produce what
the ancients called the Light of Creation.

245
00:21:46.847 --> 00:21:50.442
Able to bring life to the farthest reaches
of the universe.

246
00:21:50.601 --> 00:21:54.981
But if evil stands there...

247
00:21:56.565 --> 00:21:57.782
Then what?

248
00:21:57.942 --> 00:22:01.947
Then light turns to dark.
Life to death...

249
00:22:02.112 --> 00:22:03.580
...forever.

250
00:22:05.616 --> 00:22:08.085
Sir, there's a Mondoshawan spaceship
at the frontier...

251
00:22:08.244 --> 00:22:10.588
...requesting permission
to enter our territory.

252
00:22:11.622 --> 00:22:15.422
Give it permission to enter
our territory with our warmest regards.

253
00:22:15.584 --> 00:22:16.631
Thank you.

254
00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:18.800
Permission to enter granted.

255
00:22:35.604 --> 00:22:37.106
Showtime.

256
00:23:18.814 --> 00:23:20.191
We are lost.

257
00:23:21.483 --> 00:23:23.281
Aknot, we are connected to Earth.

258
00:23:27.823 --> 00:23:29.541
Mr. Zorg's office.

259
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:30.997
It's Aknot.

260
00:23:31.327 --> 00:23:34.627
I'm so glad to hear you, Aknot.

261
00:23:34.788 --> 00:23:37.211
The mission is accomplished.

262
00:23:38.167 --> 00:23:40.841
You'll have what you asked for
in a few hours.

263
00:23:42.171 --> 00:23:44.674
Good. I'll meet you at my factory.

264
00:23:45.007 --> 00:23:47.226
The attack was launched
by two unregistered warships.

265
00:23:47.384 --> 00:23:49.182
Close all borders and declare
a state of general alert.

266
00:23:49.345 --> 00:23:50.346
Yes, sir.

267
00:23:50.512 --> 00:23:51.729
Try to make contact
with the Mondoshawans.

268
00:23:51.889 --> 00:23:53.141
- We owe them an explanation.
- Sir.

269
00:23:53.307 --> 00:23:56.857
Three hundred years of waiting,
for nothing.

270
00:23:57.603 --> 00:23:59.446
Father,
you should go home now and rest.

271
00:23:59.605 --> 00:24:00.948
No.

272
00:24:01.106 --> 00:24:02.699
The Mondoshawan...

273
00:24:03.192 --> 00:24:05.194
I am their contact on Earth.
They will come for me.

274
00:24:05.361 --> 00:24:08.911
Father, this is government business now.
I will keep you informed.

275
00:24:11.867 --> 00:24:14.370
The rescue team has reported
from the Mondoshawan crash site.

276
00:24:14.536 --> 00:24:15.958
Any survivors?

277
00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:17.418
Only one.

278
00:24:20.709 --> 00:24:22.211
That what you call a survivor?

279
00:24:22.378 --> 00:24:24.472
A few cells are still alive.
It's more than I need.

280
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.052
- Have you identified it?
- We tried...

281
00:24:26.215 --> 00:24:27.683
...but the computer went off the charts.

282
00:24:27.841 --> 00:24:30.720
You see, normal human beings
have 40 DNA memo groups...

283
00:24:30.886 --> 00:24:33.480
...which is more than enough
for any species to perpetuate itself.

284
00:24:33.639 --> 00:24:36.643
This has 200,000 memo groups.

285
00:24:41.146 --> 00:24:45.777
- Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
- Yeah, can't wait to meet him.

286
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:55.252
You okay, general? Over here.

287
00:24:55.661 --> 00:24:57.584
Excuse me.

288
00:25:02.626 --> 00:25:05.095
Okay, general, I want
to show you something here.

289
00:25:05.671 --> 00:25:08.424
This is a normal human
DNA chain, okay?

290
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:10.763
You, me, anybody, right?

291
00:25:10.926 --> 00:25:12.269
Watch this.

292
00:25:13.303 --> 00:25:16.603
The compositional elements
of his DNA chain are the same as ours.

293
00:25:16.765 --> 00:25:20.019
There's more of them, tightly packed,
with infinite genetic knowledge.

294
00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:22.938
Almost like this being was engineered.

295
00:25:27.026 --> 00:25:28.403
- Is there any danger?
- No, no, no.

296
00:25:28.569 --> 00:25:30.537
We put it through
the cellular hygiene detector.

297
00:25:30.696 --> 00:25:32.790
The cell is, for lack of a better word...

298
00:25:33.407 --> 00:25:34.784
...perfect.

299
00:25:36.076 --> 00:25:38.078
Okay, go ahead.

300
00:25:38.245 --> 00:25:39.963
But Mr. Perfect better be polite.

301
00:25:40.122 --> 00:25:42.216
Otherwise, I turn him into cat food.

302
00:25:42.708 --> 00:25:44.005
Activate it.

303
00:26:15.491 --> 00:26:16.868
Tissue processing.

304
00:26:30.547 --> 00:26:33.676
Ten seconds to ultraviolet protection.

305
00:26:39.556 --> 00:26:41.274
This is the last phase.

306
00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:43.276
The cells are bombarded
by greasy solar atoms...

307
00:26:43.435 --> 00:26:45.608
...which forces the body
to react to protect itself.

308
00:26:45.771 --> 00:26:47.239
That means growing skin.

309
00:26:47.397 --> 00:26:48.774
Wonderful.

310
00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:56.452
Reconstruction complete.

311
00:26:59.785 --> 00:27:01.378
Remove the shield.

312
00:27:09.795 --> 00:27:12.298
I told you. Perfect.

313
00:27:20.806 --> 00:27:22.058
Thermal bandages.

314
00:27:26.436 --> 00:27:30.816
I'd, um, like to take a few pictures...

315
00:27:31.733 --> 00:27:33.110
...for the archives.

316
00:28:33.754 --> 00:28:35.256
- What's she saying?
- I don't know.

317
00:28:35.422 --> 00:28:37.015
Activate the phonic detector.

318
00:28:49.645 --> 00:28:51.864
Is, uh...? Is that thing solid?

319
00:28:52.022 --> 00:28:53.490
- Unbreakable.
- Good.

320
00:29:03.659 --> 00:29:05.161
If you want out...

321
00:29:05.494 --> 00:29:09.215
...you're going to have to learn
to develop those communication skills.

322
00:29:27.224 --> 00:29:28.567
General alert.

323
00:29:55.252 --> 00:29:56.720
Perfect.

324
00:30:01.174 --> 00:30:03.017
Ladder on 18.

325
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:05.262
Two men with me.
The rest in the main ventilation.

326
00:30:05.429 --> 00:30:06.430
Okay, sir.

327
00:30:25.532 --> 00:30:26.704
This way.

328
00:31:02.235 --> 00:31:03.987
Okay, lady, stay calm.

329
00:31:04.154 --> 00:31:05.747
This is the police.

330
00:31:06.239 --> 00:31:07.991
There's nowhere else to go.

331
00:31:08.158 --> 00:31:12.129
So you're gonna slowly turn around
and put your hands on the floor.

332
00:31:12.287 --> 00:31:13.914
Do you understand me?

333
00:31:17.292 --> 00:31:18.635
She doesn't.

334
00:31:43.485 --> 00:31:45.158
I think we need a flying unit here.

335
00:31:47.114 --> 00:31:51.119
This is the police. This is the police.

336
00:31:51.284 --> 00:31:53.252
We are processing your identification.

337
00:31:53.412 --> 00:31:55.915
Please put your arms up
and follow our instructions.

338
00:32:08.009 --> 00:32:09.306
She has no file.

339
00:32:18.437 --> 00:32:19.859
She dove off.

340
00:32:32.826 --> 00:32:34.328
You just had an accident.

341
00:32:34.494 --> 00:32:37.498
Yes, I know I just had an accident,
you daffy bastard!

342
00:32:39.082 --> 00:32:41.210
- You have one point left on your license.
- You have one point...

343
00:32:41.376 --> 00:32:42.923
Look out!

344
00:32:43.086 --> 00:32:44.679
No, no! Left!

345
00:32:49.009 --> 00:32:50.886
I can't believe it. Shit.

346
00:32:56.725 --> 00:32:58.227
Any survivors?

347
00:33:04.232 --> 00:33:05.734
Hi.

348
00:33:08.778 --> 00:33:10.030
Are you okay?

349
00:33:37.432 --> 00:33:38.900
Boom.

350
00:33:39.059 --> 00:33:41.562
Boom. Yeah, I understand "boom."

351
00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:44.022
Bada boom.

352
00:33:44.606 --> 00:33:47.234
Big. Big bada boom.

353
00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:48.572
Big...

354
00:33:48.735 --> 00:33:50.328
Bada big boom.

355
00:33:50.487 --> 00:33:51.784
- Big boom.
- Yeah.

356
00:33:51.947 --> 00:33:54.746
- Yeah, big bada boom.
- Bada boom.

357
00:33:54.908 --> 00:33:57.286
Big boom. Big bada boom.

358
00:34:00.622 --> 00:34:01.999
You're lucky you're not dead.

359
00:34:05.752 --> 00:34:07.846
This is a police control.

360
00:34:08.004 --> 00:34:10.803
Please keep your hands
on the wheel.

361
00:34:10.966 --> 00:34:13.970
You have an unauthorized passenger
in your vehicle.

362
00:34:14.135 --> 00:34:16.058
We are going to arrest her.

363
00:34:16.221 --> 00:34:17.894
Thank you for your cooperation.

364
00:34:18.056 --> 00:34:19.478
Sorry, honey.

365
00:34:19.641 --> 00:34:21.564
Looks like this is your ride.

366
00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:23.444
Open the door.

367
00:34:24.604 --> 00:34:26.902
- Akta.
- Better do what they say.

368
00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.777
Sorry.

369
00:34:52.966 --> 00:34:55.094
"Please...

370
00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:57.308
...help."

371
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:59.017
I've only got one point left
on my license...

372
00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:03.026
...and I need that to get back to the garage
and get the cab a six-month overhaul.

373
00:35:03.184 --> 00:35:04.857
You understand?

374
00:35:06.438 --> 00:35:08.816
Can you please open
the passenger door?

375
00:35:09.858 --> 00:35:12.862
Ple... Please...

376
00:35:14.362 --> 00:35:16.330
...help.

377
00:35:17.991 --> 00:35:19.493
I can't.

378
00:35:24.122 --> 00:35:25.544
I repeat...

379
00:35:25.707 --> 00:35:27.835
...can you please open
your passenger door?

380
00:35:28.001 --> 00:35:30.220
Yeah, yeah, sure.

381
00:35:30.378 --> 00:35:31.880
Why not?

382
00:35:45.935 --> 00:35:47.687
Thank you for your cooperation.

383
00:35:50.857 --> 00:35:52.200
Help.

384
00:35:53.693 --> 00:35:55.695
Finger's gonna kill me.

385
00:36:03.745 --> 00:36:05.247
Emergency! Emergency!

386
00:36:05.413 --> 00:36:07.336
One point has been
removed from your license.

387
00:36:07.499 --> 00:36:09.376
Yes, I know!

388
00:36:09.542 --> 00:36:10.964
...on your license.

389
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:16.432
This is so stupid.

390
00:36:17.759 --> 00:36:20.057
All units assist
in pursuit of yellow cab, Level 10.

391
00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:21.893
Unit 47, we're on the way...

392
00:36:22.055 --> 00:36:23.728
...as soon as we finish lunch.

393
00:36:26.685 --> 00:36:28.608
Two golden menus.

394
00:36:29.062 --> 00:36:31.781
- Thank you.
- I'm too old, too tired...

395
00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:34.409
...and too hungry
to go chasing some hot rod.

396
00:36:36.277 --> 00:36:37.779
Thank you so much.

397
00:36:41.408 --> 00:36:43.752
And I'm definitely too thirsty.

398
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:46.083
Look out!

399
00:36:48.581 --> 00:36:49.878
Whoa.

400
00:36:50.291 --> 00:36:51.793
We got lucky.

401
00:36:53.128 --> 00:36:55.756
If they don't chase you after a mile,
they don't chase you.

402
00:37:03.012 --> 00:37:04.229
Maybe it's two miles.

403
00:37:05.724 --> 00:37:07.146
Hang on.

404
00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:19.488
Look, lady, I only speak two
languages: English and bad English!

405
00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:22.953
Run an ID.

406
00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:29.836
Don't get me wrong, I'm for conversation,
but maybe you could shut up for a minute!

407
00:37:31.499 --> 00:37:33.217
I get nothing. He's got a scan blocker.

408
00:37:33.376 --> 00:37:36.129
Means he's a car thief. Blast him.

409
00:37:40.425 --> 00:37:42.098
I don't know what you did
to piss these guys off...

410
00:37:44.512 --> 00:37:46.981
...but they are really pissed off!
Hold on!

411
00:38:04.491 --> 00:38:06.334
I think we're safe for a while.

412
00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:33.728
You want to play it soft?
We'll play it soft.

413
00:38:33.895 --> 00:38:37.240
You want to play it hard?
Let's play it hard.

414
00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.044
We make it to the fog,
we'll be all right.

415
00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.207
If we make the fog.

416
00:39:12.225 --> 00:39:15.104
How do they expect us
to find anything in this shit?

417
00:39:20.733 --> 00:39:24.738
We're just gonna wait here for a little while
until things quiet down, if you don't mind.

418
00:39:25.738 --> 00:39:27.115
Hey.

419
00:39:38.626 --> 00:39:39.752
Shit.

420
00:39:49.095 --> 00:39:50.438
You okay?

421
00:39:52.432 --> 00:39:53.649
Priest.

422
00:39:54.142 --> 00:39:56.941
You don't need a priest,
you just need a doctor. You'll be all right.

423
00:39:57.103 --> 00:39:59.947
Vito Cornelius.

424
00:40:00.106 --> 00:40:01.153
What?

425
00:40:01.316 --> 00:40:02.989
Priest.

426
00:40:06.279 --> 00:40:07.326
Yes?

427
00:40:07.822 --> 00:40:10.120
I'm, uh, looking for a priest.

428
00:40:10.283 --> 00:40:13.082
Weddings are one floor down,
my son. Congratulations.

429
00:40:15.413 --> 00:40:17.336
She's not my bride. She's my fare.

430
00:40:17.498 --> 00:40:19.421
She's looking for a priest
named Vito Cornelius.

431
00:40:19.584 --> 00:40:21.507
The phone book said he lived here.

432
00:40:21.669 --> 00:40:24.718
Yes, that's me,
but I don't know who she is.

433
00:40:24.881 --> 00:40:27.509
Nobody knows who she is.
No file, no ID, nothing.

434
00:40:27.675 --> 00:40:29.723
She's got a tattoo on this arm here.

435
00:40:30.887 --> 00:40:32.605
Tattoo?

436
00:40:42.482 --> 00:40:43.904
Fifth...

437
00:40:44.359 --> 00:40:45.611
...element.

438
00:40:51.199 --> 00:40:52.917
Finger's gonna kill me.

439
00:40:53.076 --> 00:40:55.670
- Hey! Wake up!
- Who are you?

440
00:40:55.828 --> 00:40:58.206
I brought the girl, remember?
The redhead.

441
00:41:00.416 --> 00:41:04.421
She just dropped in on me.
Started speaking this bizarre language.

442
00:41:04.587 --> 00:41:06.965
It's not bizarre.
It's the divine language.

443
00:41:07.131 --> 00:41:08.883
- The ancient language...
- Okay.

444
00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:12.179
...spoken throughout the universe
before time was time. He...

445
00:41:13.721 --> 00:41:15.018
He's a she.

446
00:41:15.181 --> 00:41:16.558
You noticed that, huh?

447
00:41:17.433 --> 00:41:18.776
Yes.

448
00:41:24.065 --> 00:41:26.409
- It's a miracle.
- Miracle she's not dead.

449
00:41:26.567 --> 00:41:28.240
We've not a moment to lose.
Wake her up.

450
00:41:28.403 --> 00:41:33.785
But gently, because this woman is
mankind's most precious possession.

451
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:35.577
She is perfect.

452
00:41:40.248 --> 00:41:41.670
Perfect.

453
00:41:48.673 --> 00:41:49.925
More dignified.

454
00:41:50.091 --> 00:41:51.638
Hey, lady...

455
00:41:51.801 --> 00:41:53.098
...wake up.

456
00:42:05.606 --> 00:42:07.950
You're right, I shouldn't have done that.
I shouldn't have done that.

457
00:42:08.109 --> 00:42:10.578
It was wrong to kiss you.
He said to wake you gently.

458
00:42:10.737 --> 00:42:12.205
You're right. You're right.

459
00:42:14.699 --> 00:42:17.623
Just thought you might
remember me from the cab.

460
00:42:18.202 --> 00:42:19.374
Remember?

461
00:42:19.537 --> 00:42:20.629
"Bada boom"?

462
00:42:21.706 --> 00:42:23.299
- "Big bada boom"?
- Boom?

463
00:42:23.708 --> 00:42:26.336
Boom. Big bada boom.
In the cab. Here, look.

464
00:42:26.502 --> 00:42:29.005
I drive a cab. This is me.

465
00:42:29.172 --> 00:42:30.799
Korben Dallas.

466
00:42:31.716 --> 00:42:33.138
Korben. You understand?

467
00:42:33.718 --> 00:42:35.846
Here. Take it, go ahead.

468
00:42:36.763 --> 00:42:38.936
You can call me
when you learn how to speak English.

469
00:42:40.641 --> 00:42:42.234
Oop. Ah.

470
00:42:42.393 --> 00:42:43.861
Just kidding. Kidding.

471
00:42:46.314 --> 00:42:47.816
And you... What is your name?

472
00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:50.493
You.

473
00:42:50.651 --> 00:42:52.244
Korben.

474
00:42:54.739 --> 00:42:57.868
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai
Ekbat De Sebat.

475
00:42:58.868 --> 00:43:00.666
Good. That's...

476
00:43:01.329 --> 00:43:03.002
That whole thing's your name, huh?

477
00:43:03.873 --> 00:43:05.796
Do you have...

478
00:43:07.001 --> 00:43:08.253
...a shorter name?

479
00:43:08.419 --> 00:43:11.093
Not "yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh."

480
00:43:11.255 --> 00:43:12.507
Short.

481
00:43:14.675 --> 00:43:15.927
Korben Dallas.

482
00:43:19.055 --> 00:43:20.307
Leeloo.

483
00:43:22.517 --> 00:43:23.860
Leeloo.

484
00:43:24.769 --> 00:43:26.191
Korben, Leeloo.

485
00:43:26.521 --> 00:43:28.194
Leeloo, Korben.

486
00:43:45.998 --> 00:43:47.671
Father, are you sure
she's a supreme being?

487
00:43:47.834 --> 00:43:49.757
Absolutely sure.

488
00:43:49.919 --> 00:43:52.672
Old friends. Okay. Yeah, you're right.

489
00:43:52.839 --> 00:43:56.218
Listen, do you think you could ask her
if I could have the gun back, please?

490
00:43:56.384 --> 00:43:58.386
- What's your name?
- Korben Dallas.

491
00:43:59.595 --> 00:44:02.064
Thank you, Mr. Dallas, for all your help.
Thank you so much.

492
00:44:02.223 --> 00:44:04.225
You've been so kind,
but now the girl needs rest...

493
00:44:04.392 --> 00:44:06.565
...because she's been
on a long trip.

494
00:44:06.727 --> 00:44:08.946
Yes, I know.
I was there when she landed.

495
00:44:09.856 --> 00:44:11.483
Wait, wait, hey. Wait, wait, Father.

496
00:44:11.649 --> 00:44:15.153
She said something I didn't understand.
Well, I didn't understand any of it...

497
00:44:15.319 --> 00:44:19.119
- ...but what does "ekto gamat" mean?
- "Never without my permission."

498
00:44:19.824 --> 00:44:21.326
That's what I thought.

499
00:44:29.625 --> 00:44:31.343
I shouldn't have kissed her.

500
00:44:36.757 --> 00:44:39.931
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.
I forgot your food.

501
00:44:42.096 --> 00:44:44.440
How about some nice Thai food
to apologize, huh?

502
00:44:44.599 --> 00:44:46.601
Yeah, yeah, hold on. What?

503
00:44:46.767 --> 00:44:49.236
Hey, buddy, I'm waiting all day here.

504
00:44:49.395 --> 00:44:51.113
- Finger.
- Where is the cab?

505
00:44:51.272 --> 00:44:53.070
Car's running fine.
Purring like a kitten.

506
00:44:53.232 --> 00:44:55.109
"Fine." What "fine"?

507
00:44:55.276 --> 00:44:58.120
I know you, Dallas.
"Fine" ain't in your vocabulary.

508
00:44:58.279 --> 00:45:00.577
Come on, you can tell
your old buddy Finger what happened.

509
00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:02.788
- What? You save the planet?
- Listen.

510
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:05.749
You dinged the fender again. Right?
You dinged the goddamn fender.

511
00:45:05.912 --> 00:45:10.634
Finger, I was on my way over to see you
and a big fare fell in my lap.

512
00:45:10.791 --> 00:45:13.635
You know, one of these really big fares
that you just can't resist.

513
00:45:13.794 --> 00:45:16.092
Oh. How big?

514
00:45:24.472 --> 00:45:26.315
Five-nine...

515
00:45:26.891 --> 00:45:28.143
...blue eyes...

516
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:30.311
...long legs, great skin.

517
00:45:30.645 --> 00:45:32.488
You know. Perfect.

518
00:45:32.647 --> 00:45:34.240
Uh-huh. I see.

519
00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:38.198
And this perfect fare,
she got a name?

520
00:45:38.694 --> 00:45:40.492
Yeah.

521
00:45:40.655 --> 00:45:42.123
Leeloo.

522
00:45:49.372 --> 00:45:50.669
What's she doing?

523
00:45:50.831 --> 00:45:53.835
Learning our history,
the last 5000 years that she's missed.

524
00:45:54.001 --> 00:45:55.674
Been asleep for quite a while, you know.

525
00:46:07.932 --> 00:46:11.027
Father, I know she's been through a lot,
but we don't have much time.

526
00:46:11.185 --> 00:46:12.357
Yes, you're right.

527
00:46:14.855 --> 00:46:17.699
Chicken. Good.

528
00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:22.572
Chicken.

529
00:46:27.326 --> 00:46:30.705
I'm really sorry to interrupt you...

530
00:46:30.871 --> 00:46:32.248
...but the case...

531
00:46:32.748 --> 00:46:34.375
...with the stones...

532
00:46:35.543 --> 00:46:36.590
...where is it?

533
00:46:38.963 --> 00:46:40.215
Stolen?

534
00:46:42.758 --> 00:46:45.477
Who in God's name
would do such a thing?

535
00:46:50.474 --> 00:46:53.603
Excuse me, sir. The council is worried
about the economy heating up.

536
00:46:53.769 --> 00:46:56.443
They wondered
if it'd be possible to fire 500,000.

537
00:46:56.605 --> 00:46:59.449
Maybe from one of the smaller companies
where no one would notice...

538
00:46:59.608 --> 00:47:01.076
...like one of the cab companies.

539
00:47:01.235 --> 00:47:03.112
Fire one million.

540
00:47:03.279 --> 00:47:05.577
But 500,000...

541
00:47:10.077 --> 00:47:12.580
One million. Fine, sir.

542
00:47:12.997 --> 00:47:14.749
Sorry to have disturbed you.

543
00:47:24.091 --> 00:47:25.764
Oh, it's, uh...

544
00:47:25.926 --> 00:47:27.803
- It's for the Supreme...
- Yes, yes, yes.

545
00:47:29.555 --> 00:47:31.273
Oh, sorry.

546
00:47:32.099 --> 00:47:36.445
I didn't know your size, and I found you
this makeup box, okay?

547
00:47:36.604 --> 00:47:39.699
- You just put it like that.
- Thank you.

548
00:47:39.857 --> 00:47:42.110
Yes, there was a man with a limp...

549
00:47:42.818 --> 00:47:45.947
...came here about a month ago
asking questions about the stones.

550
00:47:46.113 --> 00:47:47.615
He said he was an art dealer.

551
00:47:50.659 --> 00:47:52.332
What was his name?

552
00:47:54.288 --> 00:47:56.040
I'm so bad with names.

553
00:48:02.296 --> 00:48:05.766
- They really make her...
- Perfect, I know.

554
00:48:10.054 --> 00:48:11.681
What did she say?

555
00:48:13.265 --> 00:48:15.768
She says she knows
exactly where they are.

556
00:48:19.313 --> 00:48:23.159
My dear Aknot, how about those
two little planes that you borrowed?

557
00:48:24.068 --> 00:48:27.163
Aknot, is that you? What an ugly face.

558
00:48:27.321 --> 00:48:28.664
It doesn't suit you.

559
00:48:29.365 --> 00:48:30.992
Take it off.

560
00:48:33.244 --> 00:48:34.496
That's better.

561
00:48:34.662 --> 00:48:36.460
Never be ashamed of who you are.

562
00:48:36.622 --> 00:48:38.090
You're warriors. Be proud.

563
00:48:38.666 --> 00:48:41.670
So what if the federal government
scattered your people to the wind.

564
00:48:41.836 --> 00:48:44.965
What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

565
00:48:45.131 --> 00:48:48.761
Your time for revenge
is at hand. Voilà.

566
00:48:48.926 --> 00:48:50.644
The ZF-1.

567
00:48:53.305 --> 00:48:56.730
It's light. Handle's adjustable for easy
carrying. Good for righties and lefties.

568
00:48:56.892 --> 00:48:58.940
Breaks down into four parts,
undetectable by x-ray.

569
00:48:59.103 --> 00:49:01.071
Ideal for quick, discreet interventions.

570
00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:02.652
A word on firepower:

571
00:49:02.815 --> 00:49:06.365
Titanium recharger, 3000-round clip
with bursts of 3 to 300.

572
00:49:06.527 --> 00:49:09.371
With the replay button,
another Zorg invention, it's even easier.

573
00:49:10.489 --> 00:49:11.661
One shot...

574
00:49:12.658 --> 00:49:15.537
...and replay sends every following shot
to the same location.

575
00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:26.010
And to finish the job,
all the Zorg oldies but goldies.

576
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:27.722
Rocket launcher.

577
00:49:29.925 --> 00:49:33.054
Arrow launcher with exploding
or poisonous gas heads.

578
00:49:34.472 --> 00:49:37.066
Very practical.
Our famous net launcher.

579
00:49:38.601 --> 00:49:40.069
The always-efficient flamethrower.

580
00:49:44.398 --> 00:49:45.490
My favorite.

581
00:49:46.025 --> 00:49:50.576
And for the grand finale,
the all-new ice-cube system.

582
00:49:59.163 --> 00:50:02.588
Four full crates
delivered right on time.

583
00:50:03.417 --> 00:50:07.422
And what about you, my dear Aknot?
Did you bring me what I asked you for?

584
00:50:08.714 --> 00:50:10.432
Yes.

585
00:50:15.763 --> 00:50:17.436
Magnificent.

586
00:50:21.727 --> 00:50:22.774
This...

587
00:50:24.396 --> 00:50:26.649
This case is empty.

588
00:50:28.275 --> 00:50:30.448
- What do you mean, empty?
- Empty...

589
00:50:30.611 --> 00:50:32.284
...the opposite of full.

590
00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:35.784
This case is supposed to be full!

591
00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:39.957
Anyone care to explain?

592
00:50:42.206 --> 00:50:46.256
The Guardians gave the stones
to someone they could trust.

593
00:50:49.421 --> 00:50:51.469
Who took another route.

594
00:50:52.925 --> 00:50:55.678
She's supposed
to contact this person...

595
00:50:55.844 --> 00:50:57.471
...in a hotel.

596
00:51:01.642 --> 00:51:04.646
And she's looking
for the address. Easy.

597
00:51:06.605 --> 00:51:07.822
Dot.

598
00:51:12.236 --> 00:51:15.115
It's Planet Fhloston,
in the Angel Constellation.

599
00:51:16.949 --> 00:51:19.577
- We're saved.
- I'm screwed.

600
00:51:19.743 --> 00:51:22.041
You asked for a case.
We brought you a case.

601
00:51:22.204 --> 00:51:24.673
A case with four stones in it!

602
00:51:24.832 --> 00:51:27.130
Not one or two or three, but four!

603
00:51:27.293 --> 00:51:28.510
Four stones!

604
00:51:28.669 --> 00:51:31.468
What the hell am I supposed to do
with an empty case?

605
00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:33.849
We are warriors, not merchants.

606
00:51:34.008 --> 00:51:37.137
But you can still count!
Look, it's easy. Look at my fingers.

607
00:51:37.303 --> 00:51:38.771
Four stones, four crates.

608
00:51:38.929 --> 00:51:41.853
Zero stones, zero crates!

609
00:51:42.683 --> 00:51:44.185
Pack everything up!
We're out of here!

610
00:51:47.479 --> 00:51:49.573
We risked our lives.

611
00:51:49.732 --> 00:51:53.657
I believe a little compensation is in order.

612
00:51:53.819 --> 00:51:57.995
Oh. So you are merchants after all.

613
00:51:59.366 --> 00:52:02.040
Leave him one crate for the cause.

614
00:52:05.039 --> 00:52:07.758
I don't like warriors.
Too narrow-minded, no subtlety...

615
00:52:07.916 --> 00:52:11.170
...and worse, they fight
for hopeless causes, honor.

616
00:52:11.337 --> 00:52:14.216
Honor's killed millions of people.
Hasn't saved a single one.

617
00:52:14.381 --> 00:52:16.850
I'll tell you what I do like, though: a killer.

618
00:52:17.009 --> 00:52:20.513
A dyed-in-the-wool killer, cold-blooded,
clean, methodical and thorough.

619
00:52:20.679 --> 00:52:22.681
Now, a real killer,
when he picked up the ZF-1...

620
00:52:22.848 --> 00:52:26.273
...would've immediately asked about
the red button on the bottom of the gun.

621
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:46.213
Bring me the priest.

622
00:52:48.791 --> 00:52:51.214
I got everything here we need
to know about Fhloston Paradise...

623
00:52:51.377 --> 00:52:53.050
...and a detailed blueprint
of the entire hotel.

624
00:52:53.212 --> 00:52:56.216
Good work, my son. Now all we've got
to do is find a way of getting there.

625
00:52:56.382 --> 00:52:58.931
It's not gonna be easy. There's
a charity ball on Fhloston tomorrow.

626
00:52:59.093 --> 00:53:02.393
Flights are full, and with the celebrities,
the hotel will be guarded like a fortress.

627
00:53:02.554 --> 00:53:04.147
But there must be a way
of getting there.

628
00:53:08.644 --> 00:53:10.442
No.

629
00:53:10.604 --> 00:53:11.981
I'll get it.

630
00:53:13.607 --> 00:53:14.608
Weddings?

631
00:53:17.277 --> 00:53:18.369
Not really.

632
00:53:18.529 --> 00:53:21.373
- Mr. Zorg would like to talk to you.
- Mister who?

633
00:53:21.532 --> 00:53:23.250
Mr. Zorg.

634
00:53:23.784 --> 00:53:27.254
Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg.

635
00:53:30.958 --> 00:53:33.086
It's nice to see you again, Father.

636
00:53:33.252 --> 00:53:35.630
Ah, I remember you now.

637
00:53:36.130 --> 00:53:38.724
The so-called art dealer.

638
00:53:38.882 --> 00:53:42.978
I'm glad you got your memory back,
because you're gonna need it.

639
00:53:45.097 --> 00:53:46.599
Where are the stones?

640
00:53:47.433 --> 00:53:50.778
I don't know. And even if I did know,
I wouldn't tell somebody like you.

641
00:53:51.145 --> 00:53:52.271
Why?

642
00:53:52.938 --> 00:53:56.158
- What's wrong with me?
- I try to serve life.

643
00:53:57.484 --> 00:53:59.157
But you only...

644
00:53:59.486 --> 00:54:01.454
...seem to want to destroy it.

645
00:54:01.613 --> 00:54:03.286
Ah, Father...

646
00:54:04.116 --> 00:54:07.336
...you're so wrong. Let me explain.

647
00:54:11.331 --> 00:54:13.333
Life, which you so nobly serve...

648
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:16.344
...comes from destruction,
disorder and chaos.

649
00:54:16.503 --> 00:54:18.130
Now, take this empty glass.

650
00:54:18.297 --> 00:54:21.016
Here it is, peaceful, serene, boring.

651
00:54:21.175 --> 00:54:23.018
But if it is...

652
00:54:23.886 --> 00:54:25.229
...destroyed...

653
00:54:29.391 --> 00:54:31.769
Look at all these little things.
So busy now.

654
00:54:31.935 --> 00:54:34.358
Notice how each one is useful.

655
00:54:37.316 --> 00:54:41.162
What a lovely ballet ensues,
so full of form and color.

656
00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:44.699
Now, think about all those people
that created them.

657
00:54:44.865 --> 00:54:46.162
Technicians, engineers.

658
00:54:46.325 --> 00:54:49.249
Hundreds of people who will be able
to feed their children tonight...

659
00:54:49.411 --> 00:54:53.291
...so those children can grow big and
strong and have children of their own...

660
00:54:53.457 --> 00:54:54.879
...and so on and so forth.

661
00:54:55.042 --> 00:54:58.046
Thus adding to the great chain...

662
00:54:58.545 --> 00:55:00.047
...of life.

663
00:55:02.508 --> 00:55:04.101
Water. Fruit.

664
00:55:04.259 --> 00:55:07.103
You see, Father, by creating
a little destruction...

665
00:55:07.262 --> 00:55:08.354
A cherry.

666
00:55:08.514 --> 00:55:10.391
...I'm, in fact, encouraging life.

667
00:55:10.891 --> 00:55:13.770
In reality, you and I are
in the same business.

668
00:55:14.728 --> 00:55:15.729
Cheers.

669
00:55:33.038 --> 00:55:35.086
Where's the robot
to pat you on the back?

670
00:55:36.708 --> 00:55:37.834
Or the engineer?

671
00:55:43.215 --> 00:55:45.934
Or their children, maybe?

672
00:55:54.935 --> 00:55:59.065
You see now how all your so-called
power counts for absolutely nothing?

673
00:55:59.731 --> 00:56:04.282
How your entire empire of destruction
comes crashing down...

674
00:56:04.444 --> 00:56:08.620
...all because of one, little cherry.

675
00:56:21.837 --> 00:56:23.589
You saved my life...

676
00:56:23.755 --> 00:56:25.974
...and in return, I'll spare yours...

677
00:56:26.633 --> 00:56:27.759
...for now.

678
00:56:28.427 --> 00:56:29.770
You're a monster, Zorg.

679
00:56:31.763 --> 00:56:33.356
I know.

680
00:56:37.227 --> 00:56:39.980
Torture who you have to,
the president, I don't care.

681
00:56:40.147 --> 00:56:41.945
Just bring me those stones.

682
00:56:42.482 --> 00:56:44.325
You have one hour.

683
00:56:58.999 --> 00:57:01.969
It's gobbling up all the communications
satellites in the galaxy.

684
00:57:02.127 --> 00:57:04.846
Why in the hell is it eating up
all the satellites?

685
00:57:05.005 --> 00:57:06.803
We're working on it, Mr. President.

686
00:57:18.518 --> 00:57:21.021
I've contacted the Mondoshawan.
They deplore the incident...

687
00:57:21.188 --> 00:57:22.656
...but they accept our apologies.

688
00:57:22.814 --> 00:57:25.067
And the stones?
Did you find them in the wreckage?

689
00:57:25.233 --> 00:57:27.656
- The stones weren't aboard the ship.
- What do you mean?

690
00:57:27.819 --> 00:57:30.698
The Mondoshawan never
fully trusted the human race.

691
00:57:30.864 --> 00:57:32.616
They gave the stones
to someone they do trust.

692
00:57:33.533 --> 00:57:36.537
Her name is Plavalaguna.
She's a diva.

693
00:57:36.703 --> 00:57:40.048
And she's going to sing at a charity ball
in Fhloston Paradise in a few hours.

694
00:57:40.207 --> 00:57:41.925
She has the stones with her.

695
00:57:42.084 --> 00:57:44.462
The Mondoshawans have accepted
an offer to help.

696
00:57:44.628 --> 00:57:47.802
All we have to do is send someone to get
the stones and bring them back to her.

697
00:57:47.965 --> 00:57:49.057
Excellent.

698
00:57:51.885 --> 00:57:54.388
I want this operation
to be discreet as possible.

699
00:57:54.554 --> 00:57:56.773
No troops. No big operation.

700
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:59.397
I want your best man
to go undercover.

701
00:57:59.559 --> 00:58:01.402
I have the perfect one.

702
00:58:05.399 --> 00:58:07.401
- You got a message.
- Yeah.

703
00:58:07.567 --> 00:58:09.569
Not gonna open it?
Could be important.

704
00:58:09.736 --> 00:58:12.910
Yeah. Like the last two I got
were important.

705
00:58:13.407 --> 00:58:16.707
First one was from my wife
telling me she's leaving.

706
00:58:17.035 --> 00:58:21.006
The second one was from my lawyer
telling me he was leaving with my wife.

707
00:58:21.415 --> 00:58:22.917
That is bad luck.

708
00:58:23.083 --> 00:58:24.426
But grandfather say:

709
00:58:24.584 --> 00:58:27.963
"It never rain every day."
This is good news, guaranteed.

710
00:58:29.172 --> 00:58:30.298
I bet your lunch.

711
00:58:31.383 --> 00:58:32.680
Okay.

712
00:58:35.721 --> 00:58:36.893
Come on.

713
00:58:39.391 --> 00:58:40.643
You are fired.

714
00:58:41.977 --> 00:58:44.196
Oh, I'm sorry.

715
00:58:47.607 --> 00:58:48.779
Well...

716
00:58:50.110 --> 00:58:51.362
At least I won lunch.

717
00:58:51.528 --> 00:58:55.783
Good philosophy.
See good in bad. I like.

718
00:58:55.949 --> 00:58:57.622
- Hello.
- Korben, sweetheart.

719
00:58:58.201 --> 00:59:00.169
You got broken fingers?
You can't punch my number?

720
00:59:00.328 --> 00:59:02.456
- Hi, Mom.
- Seventeen messages.

721
00:59:02.622 --> 00:59:06.092
Don't tell me your machine is broken.
Those things are good for 1000 years.

722
00:59:06.251 --> 00:59:09.755
Mr. Kim, you should go.
This is gonna take a minute.

723
00:59:09.921 --> 00:59:12.845
You wouldn't even feed your pussycat,
who you obviously love more than me.

724
00:59:13.008 --> 00:59:15.306
- But she didn't breast-feed you. I did.
- Goodbye, Mr. Dallas.

725
00:59:16.928 --> 00:59:18.475
Ah, fortune for you.

726
00:59:18.638 --> 00:59:21.562
...Up on me. Oh, Christ,
I'll never be a grandmother.

727
00:59:21.725 --> 00:59:24.023
- It bring you good luck!
- Yeah, sure.

728
00:59:31.193 --> 00:59:33.696
You know my poor body's failing me.
You have to take me on this trip.

729
00:59:33.862 --> 00:59:35.489
Ma, what are you talking about?

730
00:59:35.655 --> 00:59:37.453
I get it. You want to make
your only mother beg. Is that it?

731
00:59:37.616 --> 00:59:41.337
No, I don't want to make you beg.
All I want is an explanation. I just got in.

732
00:59:41.495 --> 00:59:44.339
I just smashed my cab.
I lost my job. I got mugged.

733
00:59:44.498 --> 00:59:47.798
Besides that, everything's peachy.
Thanks for asking.

734
00:59:48.376 --> 00:59:50.879
Now, will you just settle down
and explain this to me calmly.

735
00:59:51.046 --> 00:59:56.143
Oh, so you don't know you won a trip
to Fhloston Paradise for two for 10 days.

736
00:59:56.301 --> 01:00:00.226
I suppose you're just gonna leave me
on the lunar surface to freeze my ass off.

737
01:00:00.972 --> 01:00:05.318
If I'd have won a trip, I'd know about it.
Somebody would've notified me.

738
01:00:06.686 --> 01:00:10.031
Korben, they've been blaring your name
out on the radio for the last hour.

739
01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:16.492
Ma, I'll call you back.

740
01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:23.420
General Munro, how nice to see you
in the 5000 block.

741
01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:26.835
Nice apartment, major.

742
01:00:27.415 --> 01:00:30.794
Looks like you settled into a wonderful life.
Heard you lost your job.

743
01:00:32.087 --> 01:00:33.589
You heard that, huh?

744
01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:37.343
Well, don't worry. I'll get another job.

745
01:00:37.509 --> 01:00:39.511
Don't bother. We have one for you.

746
01:00:40.178 --> 01:00:42.897
"Major Dallas, you've been selected
for a mission of the utmost importance."

747
01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:45.150
- What mission?
- To save the world.

748
01:00:46.017 --> 01:00:47.860
"You leave immediately
for Fhloston Paradise.

749
01:00:48.019 --> 01:00:51.819
Retrieve four stones from the diva
Plavalaguna and bring them back."

750
01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:54.531
- Any questions?
- Yeah, just one. Why me?

751
01:00:54.693 --> 01:00:56.195
I retired six months ago,
you remember?

752
01:00:56.361 --> 01:00:57.829
Three reasons.

753
01:00:58.196 --> 01:01:02.167
One, as a member of the Elite Special
Forces Unit of the federated army...

754
01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:05.545
...you are an expert in the use of weapons
and spacecraft needed for this mission.

755
01:01:06.371 --> 01:01:09.591
Two, of all the members of your unit,
you're the most highly decorated.

756
01:01:09.749 --> 01:01:11.968
- And the third one?
- Of all the members of your unit...

757
01:01:12.127 --> 01:01:14.095
...you're the only one left alive.

758
01:01:14.754 --> 01:01:15.801
You check your messages?

759
01:01:15.964 --> 01:01:17.762
No, I've had enough good news
for one day.

760
01:01:17.924 --> 01:01:19.096
Might be important.

761
01:01:21.845 --> 01:01:22.892
You're a winner!

762
01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:26.354
You've won the annual Gemini Contest
and a trip to Fhloston Paradise for two.

763
01:01:29.561 --> 01:01:30.904
Here are your tickets.

764
01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:33.072
- You rigged the contest?
- Uh-huh.

765
01:01:33.481 --> 01:01:34.903
Congratulations.

766
01:01:37.485 --> 01:01:39.328
You couldn't think of anything
a little more discreet, huh?

767
01:01:39.487 --> 01:01:41.581
Old tricks are the best tricks, eh?

768
01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:44.584
Major Iceborg will accompany you
as your wife.

769
01:01:47.662 --> 01:01:48.914
I am not going.

770
01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:51.416
Why not?

771
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:04.012
Excuse me, general.

772
01:02:06.181 --> 01:02:08.434
Who is it? Who is it?

773
01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:12.862
- My wife.
- You remarried?

774
01:02:13.021 --> 01:02:15.991
Yes. No. I just met this girl,
but I'm gonna marry her.

775
01:02:16.149 --> 01:02:18.072
I love her,
but she hates the military.

776
01:02:18.235 --> 01:02:20.203
She knows that the military
ruined my last marriage.

777
01:02:20.362 --> 01:02:23.115
She can't have anything to do with it.
If she sees you, she'll kill me.

778
01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:24.954
- Major...
- Look, you gotta hide somewhere.

779
01:02:25.116 --> 01:02:26.493
You gotta help me.
Just hide somewhere.

780
01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.833
There's only one door,
where can we hide?

781
01:02:32.958 --> 01:02:36.178
- Major, we don't have time for this.
- It's just for one minute.

782
01:02:36.336 --> 01:02:38.384
You have no idea
how much you're helping me.

783
01:02:38.546 --> 01:02:40.640
No idea... You have no idea.

784
01:02:40.799 --> 01:02:43.143
- I'm going to be happily married.
- Major! Major! Major!

785
01:02:43.301 --> 01:02:44.803
- What?
- The three of us won't fit in there.

786
01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:46.768
Sure you will.

787
01:02:47.555 --> 01:02:49.307
Major!

788
01:02:49.683 --> 01:02:51.026
You're on my foot.

789
01:02:51.184 --> 01:02:52.527
Major! Major!

790
01:02:57.691 --> 01:02:59.193
Hi.

791
01:02:59.651 --> 01:03:02.370
I'm really sorry to have to resort
to these methods, Mr. Wallace...

792
01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:04.202
- Dallas.
- Dallas.

793
01:03:04.364 --> 01:03:07.618
We heard about your luck on the radio,
and we need your tickets for Fhloston.

794
01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:09.752
Is this the way priests
usually take vacations?

795
01:03:09.911 --> 01:03:11.584
We're not going on vacation.
We're on a mission.

796
01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:13.043
What kind of mission?

797
01:03:13.665 --> 01:03:15.793
We have to save the world, my son.

798
01:03:17.585 --> 01:03:20.759
- You're gonna save the world?
- Yes!

799
01:03:24.342 --> 01:03:26.470
Down there. Down there.

800
01:03:35.186 --> 01:03:36.859
This is a police control.

801
01:03:37.188 --> 01:03:39.691
This is not an exercise.

802
01:03:42.068 --> 01:03:44.412
Come on, get in.
One minute, all right?

803
01:03:45.113 --> 01:03:46.490
Just stay here for one minute,
I promise.

804
01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:49.660
- This is a police control.
- Don't touch anything.

805
01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:52.420
This is not an exercise.

806
01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:55.128
Can you please spread your legs...

807
01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:57.463
...and place your hands
in the yellow circles?

808
01:03:57.625 --> 01:03:59.127
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna save your ass...

809
01:03:59.294 --> 01:04:00.546
...so you can save the world.

810
01:04:00.712 --> 01:04:01.964
Yeah, but I...

811
01:04:03.757 --> 01:04:05.976
I think this is the door.
There's no name and no number.

812
01:04:06.134 --> 01:04:07.306
Let's see it.

813
01:04:12.057 --> 01:04:13.730
Sir, are you classified as human?

814
01:04:13.892 --> 01:04:16.566
Negative. I am a meat Popsicle.

815
01:04:19.397 --> 01:04:20.569
I found him.

816
01:04:21.024 --> 01:04:22.651
Mr. Korben Dallas?

817
01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:27.031
Sir, can you put your hands
in the yellow circles, please?

818
01:04:30.241 --> 01:04:31.914
Smoke you!

819
01:04:32.911 --> 01:04:34.254
Wrong answer.

820
01:04:37.332 --> 01:04:40.051
The police control is now terminated.

821
01:04:41.044 --> 01:04:44.423
Thank you for your cooperation.
Have a nice day.

822
01:04:44.589 --> 01:04:47.468
Okay, we got the guy.
Wasn't easy, but we bagged him.

823
01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:49.932
- Thanks for the tip.
- Glad to be of help, my friend.

824
01:04:50.428 --> 01:04:53.272
The guy's just been arrested
for uranium smuggling.

825
01:04:53.431 --> 01:04:54.933
Everything's going as planned.

826
01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:57.694
All I have to do now is go
to the airport, take his place...

827
01:04:57.852 --> 01:05:00.355
...and I'll be in Fhloston
in less than four hours.

828
01:05:00.772 --> 01:05:03.116
Don't come back without the stones.

829
01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:22.131
Korben Dallas. We got him.

830
01:05:22.293 --> 01:05:23.419
Perfect.

831
01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:25.634
Akanit, take command.

832
01:05:26.214 --> 01:05:28.717
Go to Fhloston and get the stones.

833
01:05:28.883 --> 01:05:30.726
If Zorg really wants them...

834
01:05:30.885 --> 01:05:33.058
...he'll have to negotiate.

835
01:05:33.221 --> 01:05:35.815
Revenge is at hand.

836
01:05:39.144 --> 01:05:43.490
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I forgot about the autowash.

837
01:05:44.065 --> 01:05:45.908
There's an autowash
in that shower.

838
01:05:51.656 --> 01:05:53.499
I'm so sorry.

839
01:05:53.867 --> 01:05:54.993
Autowash.

840
01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:58.004
Autowash, yes.
Autowash, in the shower.

841
01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:02.171
You know, it's funny.
I've met you twice today.

842
01:06:02.333 --> 01:06:05.337
Both times,
you've ended up in my arms.

843
01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.763
It's my lucky day.

844
01:06:09.007 --> 01:06:11.556
Lucky day.

845
01:06:13.553 --> 01:06:15.396
Yeah.

846
01:06:21.019 --> 01:06:22.441
Did you hear something?

847
01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:24.864
Cornelius.

848
01:06:30.904 --> 01:06:32.201
Autowash.

849
01:06:33.448 --> 01:06:35.951
- I'm so sorry. Sorry.
- I don't need your help.

850
01:06:40.205 --> 01:06:42.458
- Want a cup of coffee?
- Yes, please.

851
01:06:43.208 --> 01:06:44.551
Autowash.

852
01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:47.466
Coffee's not really my specialty.

853
01:06:48.963 --> 01:06:51.967
But you must drink a lot of coffee,
being a priest, huh?

854
01:06:58.473 --> 01:07:01.727
No, I know. I'm not proud of what I did.
I had no choice.

855
01:07:13.071 --> 01:07:14.573
I'll take the mission.

856
01:07:31.422 --> 01:07:32.844
- Did you get them?
- Yeah, I got them.

857
01:07:33.007 --> 01:07:34.634
Good.

858
01:07:38.012 --> 01:07:40.356
- "Leeloo Dallas."
- "Multi-pass."

859
01:07:40.515 --> 01:07:42.267
"Korben David Dallas." Perfect.

860
01:07:44.852 --> 01:07:47.196
No, no. I can't possibly be
your husband. I'm too old.

861
01:07:47.355 --> 01:07:49.107
Now, David is...

862
01:07:49.524 --> 01:07:51.822
...in great shape. He'll protect you.

863
01:07:51.985 --> 01:07:56.240
Now, please, go to the diva, collect
the stones and meet me at the temple.

864
01:07:56.406 --> 01:07:57.783
Now. Yes.

865
01:07:59.117 --> 01:08:00.334
Okay.

866
01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:03.963
Final call for Fhloston Paradise.

867
01:08:04.872 --> 01:08:07.375
Last call for Fhloston Paradise.
Hurry up.

868
01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:10.712
Uh...

869
01:08:10.878 --> 01:08:12.130
The tickets.

870
01:08:12.297 --> 01:08:15.016
- ID, please.
- I'm sorry.

871
01:08:16.301 --> 01:08:18.395
- There.
- In here?

872
01:08:18.553 --> 01:08:19.645
Thank you!

873
01:08:19.804 --> 01:08:20.896
Mr. Dallas?

874
01:08:21.055 --> 01:08:23.524
Uh... Yeah.

875
01:08:23.683 --> 01:08:25.981
Congratulations on winning the contest.

876
01:08:26.144 --> 01:08:28.067
Oh, right. Okay.

877
01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:29.856
- Sorry for the mess.
- The mess?

878
01:08:30.023 --> 01:08:31.149
The garbage.

879
01:08:31.858 --> 01:08:33.360
Oh, right... It's K...

880
01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:37.363
Whoo! Made it!

881
01:08:37.864 --> 01:08:40.037
I was so afraid
I wasn't gonna make this flight...

882
01:08:40.199 --> 01:08:42.873
...so I sent David here to come
and pick up my boarding pass.

883
01:08:43.036 --> 01:08:44.629
- But, um...
- But now David has to go.

884
01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:46.664
Thank you. Bye.

885
01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.588
I am Korben Dallas.

886
01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:53.304
Please report infractions to the spaceport.

887
01:08:53.463 --> 01:08:54.840
And this is?

888
01:08:55.882 --> 01:08:58.180
Leeloo Dallas. Multi-pass.

889
01:08:58.593 --> 01:09:00.140
- Yeah. Lee... Multi-pass.
- Multi-pass.

890
01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:02.021
She knows it's a multi-pass.
Leeloo Dallas.

891
01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:05.150
My wife. We're newlyweds.
Just met. You know how it is.

892
01:09:05.308 --> 01:09:09.029
Bump into each other, sparks happen...
Yeah, she knows it's a multi-pass.

893
01:09:09.187 --> 01:09:10.689
Yeah. Anyway, we're in love.

894
01:09:11.356 --> 01:09:15.031
I mean, I know
she's made to be strong.

895
01:09:15.193 --> 01:09:18.538
She's also so fragile, so human.
You know what I mean?

896
01:09:23.076 --> 01:09:24.953
- Do you want some more?
- Yeah.

897
01:09:28.456 --> 01:09:29.503
Make that two.

898
01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:31.088
Oh, David. David?

899
01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:33.548
- Where's Leeloo?
- She's on the plane with Mr. Dallas.

900
01:09:34.087 --> 01:09:35.259
- What?!
- I'm sorry, Father.

901
01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:37.640
I didn't know what to do.
I thought he was gonna kill me.

902
01:09:37.799 --> 01:09:39.551
But this is not possible.

903
01:09:40.093 --> 01:09:41.640
This is not possible.

904
01:09:41.803 --> 01:09:43.100
You want some more?

905
01:09:43.262 --> 01:09:44.605
This is all my fault.

906
01:09:45.473 --> 01:09:48.101
I am the servant. It is my mission.
I shouldn't have given it to you.

907
01:09:48.267 --> 01:09:49.268
I know.

908
01:09:51.104 --> 01:09:53.072
- Here's the key to the temple.
- Oh, no.

909
01:09:53.231 --> 01:09:56.906
Prepare for our arrival.
I go to face my destiny. Yes.

910
01:09:58.236 --> 01:10:00.409
I don't want to go to Egypt.

911
01:10:02.281 --> 01:10:04.079
Thank you!

912
01:10:04.242 --> 01:10:06.290
Dallas? Korben Dallas?

913
01:10:08.454 --> 01:10:09.580
Yeah, that's me.

914
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:12.758
Just a minute, please.

915
01:10:18.589 --> 01:10:20.762
It will take just one more minute.

916
01:10:29.767 --> 01:10:31.769
We'll be right back.

917
01:10:35.314 --> 01:10:38.158
Oh, Mr. Dallas. Oh, um,
we really need you right now.

918
01:10:38.317 --> 01:10:41.787
Ruby Rhod is broadcasting live
and he needs you for an interview.

919
01:10:41.946 --> 01:10:43.163
Miss?

920
01:10:43.614 --> 01:10:44.706
Multi-pass.

921
01:10:48.661 --> 01:10:51.665
Tell Aknot that plan A flopped.
Go to plan B.

922
01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:55.294
Aliens ahead. Spread out.

923
01:11:04.844 --> 01:11:06.517
Backup unit, zone 18.

924
01:11:16.981 --> 01:11:19.655
Mr. Ruby Rhod is the biggest radio star,
you know.

925
01:11:19.817 --> 01:11:21.694
It's a great honor to be on his talk show.

926
01:11:22.445 --> 01:11:25.164
- He's so green.
- Yes, I'm sure you're very excited.

927
01:11:25.323 --> 01:11:27.371
But I'm on my vacation
and I don't want to be bothered.

928
01:11:27.533 --> 01:11:29.501
I prefer to remain anonymous.

929
01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:34.840
Korben Dallas!

930
01:11:34.999 --> 01:11:39.220
Here he is! The one and only winner
of the Gemini Croquette Contest.

931
01:11:39.378 --> 01:11:42.723
This boy is fueled like fire,
so start melting, ladies...

932
01:11:42.882 --> 01:11:45.886
...because the boy is hotter than hot.
He's hot, hot, hot!

933
01:11:48.387 --> 01:11:50.560
The right size, the right build,
the right hair, the right on.

934
01:11:50.723 --> 01:11:51.815
Right on.

935
01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:53.226
Right on, right on.

936
01:11:53.392 --> 01:11:55.520
And he's got something to say...

937
01:11:55.686 --> 01:11:58.064
...to those 50 billion pairs
of ears out there.

938
01:11:58.689 --> 01:11:59.906
Pop it, D-man.

939
01:12:03.194 --> 01:12:04.912
Um, hi.

940
01:12:05.404 --> 01:12:07.327
Unbelievable.

941
01:12:09.826 --> 01:12:12.500
Quiver, ladies, quiver.
He's gonna set the world on fire.

942
01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:14.039
Right here from 5 to 7.

943
01:12:14.205 --> 01:12:17.755
You'll know everything
there is to know about the D-man.

944
01:12:17.917 --> 01:12:19.339
His dreams...

945
01:12:19.502 --> 01:12:20.879
...his desires...

946
01:12:21.045 --> 01:12:23.798
...his most intimates of intimates.

947
01:12:23.965 --> 01:12:26.764
And from what I'm looking at, intimate
is this studmuffin's middle name.

948
01:12:26.926 --> 01:12:28.769
So tell me, my man...

949
01:12:28.928 --> 01:12:30.396
...you nervous in the service?

950
01:12:33.266 --> 01:12:34.893
Not really.

951
01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:39.235
Freeze those knees because Korben's
in the place and he's on the case.

952
01:12:39.397 --> 01:12:43.277
Yesterday's frog
will be tomorrow's prince...

953
01:12:43.442 --> 01:12:45.740
...of Fhloston Paradise!

954
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:49.074
The hotel of a thousand and one follies,
lollies and lick-them-lollies.

955
01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:51.743
A magic fountain flow
of non-stop wine, women...

956
01:12:51.909 --> 01:12:53.661
...and hootchie-kootchie-koo...

957
01:12:53.828 --> 01:12:55.421
...all night long.

958
01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:59.050
♪ All night long
All night ♪

959
01:13:00.668 --> 01:13:01.965
Ooh.

960
01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:06.549
Start licking your stamps, little girlies...

961
01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:09.310
...because this guy's gonna
have you writing home to Mama.

962
01:13:09.468 --> 01:13:12.597
Right, here, from 5 to 7,
I'll be your voice, your tongue...

963
01:13:12.763 --> 01:13:14.481
...and I'll be hot on the trail
of the sexiest man of the year:

964
01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.938
D-man, your man...

965
01:13:19.312 --> 01:13:20.404
...my man.

966
01:13:22.815 --> 01:13:24.442
End of transmission.

967
01:13:24.609 --> 01:13:26.327
Okay, Ruby. See you tomorrow at 5.

968
01:13:27.653 --> 01:13:29.155
How was it?

969
01:13:29.322 --> 01:13:31.324
- Oh! Wow.
- Oh!

970
01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:33.492
It was just absolutely green.

971
01:13:34.994 --> 01:13:36.086
Green like what?

972
01:13:36.996 --> 01:13:38.339
Crystal green.

973
01:13:38.497 --> 01:13:40.716
Any kind of green you want...

974
01:13:40.875 --> 01:13:43.628
...tree green, emerald, pond green.

975
01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:59.527
Korben, sweetheart, what was that?
It was bad! It had nothing!

976
01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:03.030
No fire! No energy! No nothing! You know
I have a show to run here. You know?

977
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:04.862
And it must pop, pop, pop!

978
01:14:05.024 --> 01:14:06.492
So tomorrow, from 5 to 7...

979
01:14:06.651 --> 01:14:09.905
...will you please act like you have
more than a two-word vocabulary.

980
01:14:10.821 --> 01:14:12.994
It must be green!
Okay? Okay?

981
01:14:13.366 --> 01:14:16.336
Can I talk to you for a second?
Can I just talk to you?

982
01:14:16.994 --> 01:14:19.747
I didn't come here to play
Pumba on the radio.

983
01:14:19.914 --> 01:14:22.838
So tomorrow, from 5 to 7,
you're gonna give yourself a hand.

984
01:14:23.334 --> 01:14:25.678
- Green?
- Super-green.

985
01:14:27.672 --> 01:14:29.299
Dallas? Korben Dallas?

986
01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:30.717
That's me.

987
01:14:31.801 --> 01:14:35.055
I only have one Korben Dallas on my list,
and he's already checked in, okay?

988
01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:42.236
That's impossible.
I am Korben Dallas.

989
01:14:42.561 --> 01:14:45.189
Sorry, sir. Boarding is finished.

990
01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:48.068
Wait, wait, wait!

991
01:14:48.234 --> 01:14:51.204
Hey, hey, hey!
I need to talk to someone!

992
01:14:51.362 --> 01:14:53.080
I don't believe this!

993
01:14:54.073 --> 01:14:57.373
This is a police control.

994
01:14:57.535 --> 01:15:00.209
- Okay, I'm sorry. I'm calm.
- Put your hands in the yellow circles.

995
01:15:00.371 --> 01:15:02.123
There's been a mistake.
There's been a mistake.

996
01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:04.758
To make your flight
as short as possible...

997
01:15:04.917 --> 01:15:07.136
...our flight attendants are switching
on the sleep regulator...

998
01:15:07.294 --> 01:15:10.093
...which will regulate your sleeping
during the flight.

999
01:15:14.468 --> 01:15:15.594
Thank you.

1000
01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:19.978
Hi.

1001
01:15:20.141 --> 01:15:22.815
- Oh, you speak English now.
- Yes. I learn.

1002
01:15:22.977 --> 01:15:24.103
Good.

1003
01:15:24.937 --> 01:15:26.780
Leeloo, we are not on vacation.

1004
01:15:26.939 --> 01:15:30.443
I'm on a very important mission.
I work for some very important people.

1005
01:15:30.609 --> 01:15:33.579
If I hadn't come to get you, you would be
in big trouble. Do you understand that?

1006
01:15:33.738 --> 01:15:36.116
- Do you understand? Big trouble?
- Yes.

1007
01:15:36.282 --> 01:15:38.284
But you, no trouble.

1008
01:15:39.326 --> 01:15:41.499
Me, fifth element.

1009
01:15:42.288 --> 01:15:44.211
Supreme being.

1010
01:15:44.999 --> 01:15:47.127
Me protect you.

1011
01:15:50.421 --> 01:15:51.638
Sleep.

1012
01:15:54.717 --> 01:15:56.640
- Sweet dreams, Mr. Dallas.
- No, wait...

1013
01:16:00.848 --> 01:16:03.192
Sleep regulator operative
in zone one, captain.

1014
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:05.728
Thank you.
Zone two, are you operative?

1015
01:16:06.353 --> 01:16:07.696
Zone two?

1016
01:16:07.855 --> 01:16:09.357
Yeah, everything's ready, captain.

1017
01:16:09.523 --> 01:16:11.150
- Mr. Rhod.
- What?

1018
01:16:11.317 --> 01:16:13.365
You're gonna have to assume
your individual position.

1019
01:16:13.527 --> 01:16:15.404
I don't want one position,
I want all positions!

1020
01:16:16.739 --> 01:16:18.161
Mr. Rhod!

1021
01:16:19.742 --> 01:16:22.370
- Parasites in landing gear.
- Ground, you copy?

1022
01:16:22.536 --> 01:16:24.083
Got it. Front gear.

1023
01:16:24.246 --> 01:16:26.999
Hey, man, give me some heat, man!

1024
01:16:27.166 --> 01:16:30.841
We need some heat here, man!
Give me some heat!

1025
01:16:31.837 --> 01:16:34.135
Some heat over here, man!

1026
01:16:34.298 --> 01:16:37.518
Good shit, man.
Put the heat over here, man!

1027
01:16:51.148 --> 01:16:54.994
Thank you!
Thank you very much!

1028
01:16:57.738 --> 01:16:59.911
Come, come, come, come.
Give me this. Give me this.

1029
01:17:03.202 --> 01:17:04.374
Take that.

1030
01:17:05.037 --> 01:17:06.914
Mr. Rhod!

1031
01:17:08.207 --> 01:17:09.880
You can call me Ruby.

1032
01:17:11.418 --> 01:17:13.091
Fueled and ready to go.

1033
01:17:14.296 --> 01:17:16.594
- Yep.
- I'll buy you one, man.

1034
01:17:19.009 --> 01:17:20.556
Have you taken off already?

1035
01:17:21.345 --> 01:17:24.349
- I'm not on the plane.
- What?

1036
01:17:24.515 --> 01:17:27.894
The real Dallas took my place.
I don't understand.

1037
01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:29.528
Are you making fun of me?

1038
01:17:29.687 --> 01:17:31.906
No, no, no! I swear! I swear!

1039
01:17:32.064 --> 01:17:35.159
I never felt this way before
with a human.

1040
01:17:35.317 --> 01:17:38.116
- Really?
- Yeah!

1041
01:17:38.571 --> 01:17:42.292
I've tried everything, sir. There's
no other way of getting on this plane.

1042
01:17:50.416 --> 01:17:53.215
- Ground is clear.
- Roger. Ready for lift-off?

1043
01:17:53.377 --> 01:17:54.629
Confirmed.

1044
01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:03.304
Not there. No, please, not there.
Please, not there.

1045
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:05.143
- Power pressure?
- Primed.

1046
01:18:09.852 --> 01:18:11.274
- Protection?
- Confirmed.

1047
01:18:11.979 --> 01:18:13.526
Power increase.

1048
01:18:13.689 --> 01:18:14.781
Ten seconds.

1049
01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:16.442
I am...

1050
01:18:17.151 --> 01:18:18.368
...a little...

1051
01:18:19.069 --> 01:18:21.288
- ...disappointed.
- Five.

1052
01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:24.121
And if there is one thing
I do not like...

1053
01:18:24.283 --> 01:18:26.706
- Three...
- ...it is to be...

1054
01:18:26.869 --> 01:18:28.462
...two...

1055
01:18:28.621 --> 01:18:30.419
- ...disappointed.
- ...one...

1056
01:18:30.581 --> 01:18:32.629
Sorry, sir.
This will never happen again.

1057
01:18:33.083 --> 01:18:35.085
- I know.
- ...lift-off.

1058
01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:49.684
- Landing gear secure.
- Roger. Checklist for light speed.

1059
01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:18.179
Sir, we're finally getting something.

1060
01:19:19.004 --> 01:19:20.631
It's sending radio wavelengths.

1061
01:19:21.048 --> 01:19:24.302
- What does it want with radio waves?
- Maybe it wants to make a call.

1062
01:19:29.014 --> 01:19:30.687
Zorg's office.

1063
01:19:31.725 --> 01:19:34.103
I told you I did not want
to be disturbed.

1064
01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:37.365
I know you don't want to be disturbed
except if it's Mr. Shadow...

1065
01:19:37.523 --> 01:19:39.241
...and it's Mr. Shadow on the line.

1066
01:19:49.201 --> 01:19:51.203
It's Shadow again.

1067
01:19:51.578 --> 01:19:53.080
Zorg here.

1068
01:19:53.247 --> 01:19:58.048
- Am I disturbing you?
- No, no, no, I was just...

1069
01:20:00.379 --> 01:20:01.596
Where are you?

1070
01:20:02.256 --> 01:20:04.554
SHADOW:
Not far now.

1071
01:20:06.051 --> 01:20:07.098
Good.

1072
01:20:07.761 --> 01:20:09.229
Good, good.

1073
01:20:09.388 --> 01:20:13.734
How are the stones?

1074
01:20:13.892 --> 01:20:17.897
Fine. Fine. Just fine.
I'll have the...

1075
01:20:18.272 --> 01:20:21.742
I'll have the four stones
that you asked for any time now...

1076
01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:23.618
...but it wasn't easy.

1077
01:20:23.777 --> 01:20:26.246
My costs have tripled.

1078
01:20:27.114 --> 01:20:32.917
Money is of no importance.

1079
01:20:33.746 --> 01:20:39.424
I want the stones.

1080
01:20:39.585 --> 01:20:41.428
The stones...

1081
01:20:42.755 --> 01:20:45.008
...will be here.

1082
01:20:47.009 --> 01:20:48.852
I'll see to it personally.

1083
01:20:49.011 --> 01:20:52.436
I will be among you...

1084
01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:54.437
...soon.

1085
01:20:57.269 --> 01:20:59.988
- We lost it.
- We lost the signal.

1086
01:21:00.147 --> 01:21:01.945
Damn!

1087
01:21:19.166 --> 01:21:22.386
We've begun our descent.

1088
01:21:22.544 --> 01:21:24.512
The local time is 3:20 p.m.

1089
01:21:24.671 --> 01:21:28.551
Auto-temperature is currently
85 degrees Fahrenheit.

1090
01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:31.766
We do hope you've enjoyed your flight
and hope to see you again soon.

1091
01:21:51.365 --> 01:21:54.585
Welcome to paradise.

1092
01:22:05.379 --> 01:22:08.007
Excuse me, dear. Excuse me.
Thank you. Excuse me, please.

1093
01:22:28.402 --> 01:22:30.200
Wow.

1094
01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:44.547
Parasites in main ventilation.

1095
01:22:44.710 --> 01:22:46.428
Again? Don't worry, I'll get it.

1096
01:22:52.718 --> 01:22:54.220
Aah!

1097
01:22:55.262 --> 01:22:58.436
- Have we arrived yet?
- Yeah.

1098
01:22:58.599 --> 01:23:00.067
Oh, good.

1099
01:23:00.559 --> 01:23:03.563
We have 12 swimming pools
and two on the rooftop.

1100
01:23:03.729 --> 01:23:06.778
All the restaurants are
between Level 2 and Level 10.

1101
01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:11.070
The planet Fhloston has 400 beaches,
all accessible until 5 p.m.

1102
01:23:11.236 --> 01:23:14.706
Then the airship goes higher to offer you
a better view with your dinner.

1103
01:23:14.865 --> 01:23:16.913
- Is the diva here yet?
- Not yet.

1104
01:23:17.075 --> 01:23:19.624
Are there any tickets left for this opera?
I'm a really big fan.

1105
01:23:19.786 --> 01:23:22.255
You have a seat reserved, front row...

1106
01:23:22.414 --> 01:23:24.508
...next to Ruby Rhod!

1107
01:23:24.666 --> 01:23:27.761
He's so talented, don't you think?
I just love him. He's so sexy.

1108
01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:31.390
Anyway, he has your ticket for the show,
and he'll be here in 20 minutes.

1109
01:23:32.799 --> 01:23:34.847
Do you know where I can
get something to wear?

1110
01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:41.059
- Enjoy your evening, Mr. Dallas.
- Thank you.

1111
01:23:47.231 --> 01:23:48.778
Hello?

1112
01:23:48.941 --> 01:23:51.444
I never should've pushed you out.

1113
01:23:51.610 --> 01:23:53.453
- Ma?
- I was in labor for days...

1114
01:23:53.612 --> 01:23:55.330
...and this is how you repay me?

1115
01:23:55.489 --> 01:23:57.912
- I should've just gotten a robot.
- Come on, Ma.

1116
01:23:58.075 --> 01:24:00.624
Don't "come on, Ma" me.
I should be there, not you.

1117
01:24:00.786 --> 01:24:03.084
- I need a tan. I need a cocktail.
- Ma...

1118
01:24:25.811 --> 01:24:27.154
Get the case in.

1119
01:24:31.149 --> 01:24:32.867
Hello, Ms. Diva. I'm Fog.

1120
01:24:33.026 --> 01:24:36.451
Welcome to the... I am, uh, security.

1121
01:24:36.947 --> 01:24:39.826
Welcome to the... Tall...

1122
01:24:58.176 --> 01:25:00.520
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure. Yeah.

1123
01:25:00.679 --> 01:25:02.522
- What's your name?
- Fog.

1124
01:25:04.808 --> 01:25:08.028
Ms. Plavalaguna wants you to know
how glad she is that you're here.

1125
01:25:08.186 --> 01:25:11.156
She'll give you what you've come
to get after the concert.

1126
01:25:11.315 --> 01:25:12.362
Stay here.

1127
01:25:14.526 --> 01:25:19.657
You're listening
to Radio Cosmos and it is now 5 p.m.

1128
01:25:19.823 --> 01:25:21.996
- Helm to 108.
- Yes, sir.

1129
01:25:23.535 --> 01:25:25.003
Helm 108!

1130
01:25:25.162 --> 01:25:26.288
Helm to 108.

1131
01:25:26.455 --> 01:25:31.131
Time to join
Ruby Rhod and Korben Dallas...

1132
01:25:31.293 --> 01:25:35.594
...the lucky winner
of the Gemini Croquette Contest.

1133
01:25:35.756 --> 01:25:38.930
Coming at you live from Fhloston...

1134
01:25:39.092 --> 01:25:40.389
...Paradise!

1135
01:25:42.095 --> 01:25:45.565
Ruby Rhod at your service for two hours
with Korben and the hotel manager...

1136
01:25:45.724 --> 01:25:48.568
...and Miss Gemini Croquette
in person...

1137
01:25:48.727 --> 01:25:50.821
...and 8000 other lucksters here...

1138
01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:55.826
...to enjoy the privilege of the unique
concert of Miss Plavalaguna!

1139
01:25:55.984 --> 01:25:57.452
Bzzz!

1140
01:25:59.237 --> 01:26:01.490
And now we enter what must be...

1141
01:26:01.657 --> 01:26:04.331
...the most beautiful concert hall
in all the universe!

1142
01:26:04.493 --> 01:26:08.589
A perfect replica
of the old opera house...

1143
01:26:09.081 --> 01:26:10.754
...but who cares?

1144
01:26:10.916 --> 01:26:14.546
To my right, a row of ministers,
more sinisters than ministers.

1145
01:26:14.711 --> 01:26:18.215
To my left, Baby Ray,
star of stage and screen.

1146
01:26:18.382 --> 01:26:21.226
He's not gonna get much out
of this concert, because he's stone-deaf!

1147
01:26:22.094 --> 01:26:23.562
To who?

1148
01:26:24.221 --> 01:26:27.566
And here we have Roy Von Baker,
king of laser ball.

1149
01:26:27.724 --> 01:26:31.228
And here, the Emperor of Kodar Japhet
and his lovely daughter.

1150
01:26:31.395 --> 01:26:34.615
"I love to sing,"
she recently confessed to me.

1151
01:26:34.773 --> 01:26:37.276
By the way, I have a recording
of her talented voice.

1152
01:26:39.736 --> 01:26:42.114
I'll play you the rest of the song
after the concert, because right now...

1153
01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:45.124
...it's time for Korben to say
the word of the day.

1154
01:26:45.742 --> 01:26:49.588
So tell me, my man,
you happy here in the big world?

1155
01:26:51.581 --> 01:26:53.458
Thrilled.

1156
01:26:54.459 --> 01:26:57.429
And now champagne!

1157
01:27:03.468 --> 01:27:05.812
Commercial! Commercial!

1158
01:27:05.971 --> 01:27:07.644
Break for 30 seconds.

1159
01:27:07.806 --> 01:27:09.433
Bzzz!

1160
01:27:24.281 --> 01:27:25.578
Showtime.

1161
01:29:17.894 --> 01:29:21.569
Commander, I have a ship in trouble
requesting permission to dock for repairs.

1162
01:29:21.731 --> 01:29:23.074
Put him in the docking garage.

1163
01:29:23.233 --> 01:29:24.951
- Inform security.
- Sir.

1164
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:26.578
Permission granted for one hour.

1165
01:29:26.736 --> 01:29:27.908
More than I need.

1166
01:29:41.585 --> 01:29:42.928
Yes?

1167
01:29:43.086 --> 01:29:45.088
Champagne for the diva.

1168
01:29:45.422 --> 01:29:46.924
I'll take it.

1169
01:30:21.124 --> 01:30:23.047
I found it.

1170
01:30:57.994 --> 01:30:58.995
Get her!

1171
01:31:08.171 --> 01:31:09.388
Huh?

1172
01:32:33.131 --> 01:32:34.553
It was an ambush.

1173
01:32:38.261 --> 01:32:42.437
If it's war they want,
it's war they'll get!

1174
01:32:45.435 --> 01:32:49.611
Bravo! Bravo!

1175
01:32:49.773 --> 01:32:51.400
My compliments, little lady.

1176
01:32:51.566 --> 01:32:55.616
Thank you for doing all the dirty work.
I couldn't have done a better job myself.

1177
01:32:56.446 --> 01:32:57.868
Hand over the stones.

1178
01:33:38.321 --> 01:33:40.540
Nobody move!
We're taking over the ship!

1179
01:33:45.203 --> 01:33:46.705
Hands up!

1180
01:34:01.177 --> 01:34:03.396
Ruby! Ruby!

1181
01:34:54.898 --> 01:34:56.445
I know this music.

1182
01:34:58.776 --> 01:35:00.904
Let's change the beat.

1183
01:35:07.243 --> 01:35:09.587
Something's happening here.
I think we're being attacked.

1184
01:35:09.746 --> 01:35:11.965
I don't know who they are,
but they're everywhere. Wait.

1185
01:35:12.123 --> 01:35:14.296
I see one of them.
They're warriors, and they're ugly.

1186
01:35:14.459 --> 01:35:17.633
They got big teeth and they got big
foreheads and big ears, and they stink.

1187
01:35:17.795 --> 01:35:18.796
Mangalores.

1188
01:35:21.591 --> 01:35:24.060
The government sent me
to help you. Just stay calm.

1189
01:35:24.219 --> 01:35:28.349
If somebody hears this,
come and get me. I'm in the first row.

1190
01:35:30.391 --> 01:35:33.110
- You must give her the stones.
- Who?

1191
01:35:33.269 --> 01:35:34.987
The fifth element.

1192
01:35:35.146 --> 01:35:39.322
The supreme being sent to Earth
to save the universe.

1193
01:35:39.484 --> 01:35:42.203
- Leeloo?
- Yes.

1194
01:35:43.029 --> 01:35:46.408
But she's more fragile
than she seems.

1195
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:48.998
She needs your help...

1196
01:35:49.702 --> 01:35:51.670
...and your love...

1197
01:35:51.829 --> 01:35:55.424
...or she will die.

1198
01:35:59.462 --> 01:36:02.056
- No, no, no. Stay with me.
- Help!

1199
01:36:09.347 --> 01:36:13.523
If you want something done,
do it yourself.

1200
01:36:14.269 --> 01:36:17.694
Come on, honey. You can't die.
Come on. Listen to me. Wake up!

1201
01:36:17.855 --> 01:36:19.402
- Where are the stones?
- What?

1202
01:36:19.565 --> 01:36:22.034
The stones. Where are the stones?

1203
01:36:22.193 --> 01:36:23.445
The stones.

1204
01:36:37.208 --> 01:36:39.051
They're not here.

1205
01:36:39.877 --> 01:36:42.050
The stones, where are they?

1206
01:36:43.589 --> 01:36:45.091
In me.

1207
01:36:45.508 --> 01:36:47.385
What? What?

1208
01:36:53.683 --> 01:36:55.902
Oh, my God, Korben.
Korben, another one coming.

1209
01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:57.903
Korben.
Korben, I think we should go.

1210
01:36:58.062 --> 01:36:59.564
One minute. Just give me a minute.

1211
01:36:59.731 --> 01:37:01.574
Hey, you!

1212
01:37:02.108 --> 01:37:03.826
I said, you.

1213
01:37:03.985 --> 01:37:05.703
- I'm not with him.
- Where's the other?

1214
01:37:09.490 --> 01:37:11.083
I said, one minute.
Ruby, hold this gun.

1215
01:37:11.242 --> 01:37:13.620
- What? What do you want me to do?
- Hold this gun.

1216
01:37:13.786 --> 01:37:15.584
- Come on. Put your hand on it.
- Oh, my God.

1217
01:37:15.747 --> 01:37:17.545
- Got it? Hold it.
- What do I do?

1218
01:37:17.707 --> 01:37:19.584
If he moves, squeeze the trigger.

1219
01:37:20.585 --> 01:37:22.428
I don't feel right.
I don't feel right, Korben.

1220
01:37:22.587 --> 01:37:24.931
The stones are "in me."

1221
01:37:34.599 --> 01:37:36.818
Korben, I got a headache.
This ain't me.

1222
01:37:51.616 --> 01:37:52.868
Ruby...

1223
01:37:55.328 --> 01:37:57.547
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

1224
01:37:57.705 --> 01:37:58.957
Think he's gonna be okay?

1225
01:38:06.547 --> 01:38:08.970
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Korben.
Another one coming.

1226
01:38:11.511 --> 01:38:13.354
Aw, shit.
Three coming, Korben. Three.

1227
01:38:15.723 --> 01:38:18.021
Listen, you guard this with your life...

1228
01:38:18.184 --> 01:38:20.528
...or you're gonna look like
this guy right here. You green?

1229
01:38:20.686 --> 01:38:22.529
- Green.
- Super-green?

1230
01:38:22.688 --> 01:38:24.156
- Super-green.
- Is that your idea...

1231
01:38:24.315 --> 01:38:25.737
...of a discreet operation?

1232
01:38:25.900 --> 01:38:29.700
Don't worry, sir. I know my man.
He'll calm things down.

1233
01:38:42.166 --> 01:38:43.463
All right.

1234
01:38:56.973 --> 01:38:58.600
Move! Move!

1235
01:38:59.767 --> 01:39:01.735
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1236
01:39:01.894 --> 01:39:04.693
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is amazing.

1237
01:39:06.732 --> 01:39:08.985
- Let me do it.
- Right.

1238
01:39:15.616 --> 01:39:18.870
Oh, my God. Korben Dallas, Korben,
my man. Korben Dallas is in trouble.

1239
01:39:21.873 --> 01:39:23.750
Hey. Ray!

1240
01:39:25.793 --> 01:39:26.794
The gun!

1241
01:39:28.671 --> 01:39:30.514
Give me the gun. The gun. The gun!

1242
01:39:30.673 --> 01:39:36.271
I'm gonna go and try to see
if I can see something a little closer.

1243
01:39:52.862 --> 01:39:54.660
Yes, the gun. Yeah.

1244
01:40:03.873 --> 01:40:04.920
Thanks, Ray.

1245
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:09.504
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Don't shoot! I'm not armed!

1246
01:40:09.670 --> 01:40:10.717
Get up!

1247
01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:13.349
You've got the wrong guy!
Don't shoot!

1248
01:40:13.508 --> 01:40:14.805
I'm not armed! I'm not armed!

1249
01:40:18.429 --> 01:40:19.521
Oh, my God.

1250
01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:21.023
I'm on vacation.

1251
01:40:21.182 --> 01:40:25.312
It's... Don't shoot me, please.
I'm on a vacation. I won a...

1252
01:40:26.687 --> 01:40:27.813
...contest.

1253
01:40:27.980 --> 01:40:31.610
Gemini Croquette's
to Fhloston Paradise.

1254
01:40:34.195 --> 01:40:35.822
Down.

1255
01:40:37.281 --> 01:40:39.375
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- Get down!

1256
01:40:41.452 --> 01:40:43.170
I think he's trying to say
something to me.

1257
01:40:43.329 --> 01:40:44.956
Get down!

1258
01:40:58.719 --> 01:40:59.845
Sorry. Sorry, my man.

1259
01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:10.524
Korben. Korben?
Where are you, man?

1260
01:41:11.857 --> 01:41:14.485
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Korben.

1261
01:41:14.652 --> 01:41:16.905
They're coming.
Korben, they're coming.

1262
01:41:18.739 --> 01:41:20.241
Korben!

1263
01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:22.827
- Don't move.
- What?

1264
01:41:33.212 --> 01:41:36.091
- What you doing?
- Count to 10.

1265
01:41:44.181 --> 01:41:46.149
- Korben? Was that a bomb?
- Just shut up and count!

1266
01:41:46.309 --> 01:41:49.358
One, two, three, four, five...

1267
01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:51.773
...six, seven, eight...

1268
01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:54.863
...nine...

1269
01:42:18.424 --> 01:42:19.721
Ten.

1270
01:42:25.681 --> 01:42:29.606
I am very disappointed!

1271
01:42:30.227 --> 01:42:32.400
Korben, my man. Korben,
what are you looking for?

1272
01:42:32.563 --> 01:42:33.815
Control room.

1273
01:42:35.608 --> 01:42:37.281
- This is it.
- I'll be over here, all right?

1274
01:42:37.443 --> 01:42:38.945
Let's go! Let's go!

1275
01:42:42.239 --> 01:42:43.832
Quiet! Quiet!

1276
01:42:45.326 --> 01:42:47.670
- You in charge?
- Yeah.

1277
01:42:47.828 --> 01:42:49.330
How many of them are out there?

1278
01:42:50.414 --> 01:42:52.087
- I don't know.
- Let's count.

1279
01:42:55.586 --> 01:42:57.634
Seven on the left. Five on the right.

1280
01:43:04.095 --> 01:43:06.097
Four on the right. Two on the left.

1281
01:43:07.473 --> 01:43:10.147
We need to find the leader.
Mangalores won't fight without the leader.

1282
01:43:10.643 --> 01:43:13.066
One more shot
and we start killing hostages.

1283
01:43:14.146 --> 01:43:17.366
- That's the leader.
- Send someone to negotiate.

1284
01:43:19.527 --> 01:43:21.871
I... I... I...
I've never negotiated.

1285
01:43:22.029 --> 01:43:24.031
You mind if I try?

1286
01:43:24.198 --> 01:43:25.950
No, no. Sure, sure. Sure.

1287
01:43:26.117 --> 01:43:28.620
We're sending somebody in
to negotiate!

1288
01:43:37.503 --> 01:43:39.597
Anybody else wanna negotiate?

1289
01:43:39.755 --> 01:43:42.474
Where did he learn
to negotiate like that?

1290
01:43:42.967 --> 01:43:44.310
I wonder.

1291
01:43:48.806 --> 01:43:50.149
Where's Ruby?

1292
01:43:51.142 --> 01:43:52.610
I thought he was dead.

1293
01:43:52.768 --> 01:43:53.815
Master!

1294
01:43:54.478 --> 01:43:57.197
It was nothing, really.
It was just a helping hand.

1295
01:43:57.648 --> 01:44:00.026
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Ruby Rhod...

1296
01:44:00.192 --> 01:44:02.286
...still alive. Aah!

1297
01:44:02.445 --> 01:44:05.039
What's wrong with you? It hurt!

1298
01:44:07.199 --> 01:44:09.201
Wow. Zoom.

1299
01:44:11.036 --> 01:44:14.836
Korben, I realize that you must be
pretty mad at me...

1300
01:44:14.999 --> 01:44:17.468
...but I want you to know
that I am fighting for a noble cause.

1301
01:44:17.626 --> 01:44:20.425
Yes, you're trying to save the world.
I remember.

1302
01:44:20.921 --> 01:44:22.889
Right now, I'm trying
to save Leeloo, Father.

1303
01:44:23.048 --> 01:44:25.847
- Leeloo's in trouble?
- When is Leeloo not in trouble?

1304
01:44:26.010 --> 01:44:28.433
- There. Where is that?
- That's the diva's suite.

1305
01:44:29.221 --> 01:44:30.973
Leeloo.

1306
01:44:32.683 --> 01:44:34.936
Leeloo. Hang on.

1307
01:44:38.314 --> 01:44:41.614
Here, come on. How the hell do you
get yourself into these positions?

1308
01:44:42.735 --> 01:44:44.032
Come on.

1309
01:44:47.239 --> 01:44:50.243
Yeah, I'm here. It's all right.
It's all right. Everything's okay now.

1310
01:44:50.701 --> 01:44:51.748
Listen.

1311
01:44:54.455 --> 01:44:57.379
I got the stones. All right,
just take it easy, all right?

1312
01:45:00.044 --> 01:45:04.015
My man, my man, my man.
What's this thing with all these numbers?

1313
01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:11.722
It's... It's...

1314
01:45:11.889 --> 01:45:13.812
No, no, no.

1315
01:45:13.974 --> 01:45:15.601
Because if it was a bomb...

1316
01:45:15.768 --> 01:45:19.363
...the alarms would go off because all
these hotels have bomb detectors. Right?

1317
01:45:22.024 --> 01:45:24.026
This is a Type A alert.

1318
01:45:24.193 --> 01:45:27.914
For security reasons,
the hotel must be evacuated.

1319
01:45:29.114 --> 01:45:30.787
Please proceed calmly
to the lifeboats...

1320
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:32.452
Stay calm!

1321
01:45:32.618 --> 01:45:34.120
...located in the main hallways.

1322
01:45:34.286 --> 01:45:35.503
Please, stay calm!

1323
01:45:41.126 --> 01:45:43.800
Korben. Korben, my man,
you know how to stop this, right?

1324
01:45:45.923 --> 01:45:47.550
Korben?

1325
01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:52.810
Two minutes to complete evacuation.

1326
01:45:54.807 --> 01:45:57.651
- Get back!
- Evacuation! Evacuation!

1327
01:45:57.810 --> 01:46:01.155
Sorry, sir, you can't stay here.
There's a bomb in the hotel.

1328
01:46:06.110 --> 01:46:07.282
I know.

1329
01:46:22.251 --> 01:46:25.050
- I don't want to die.
- Please, my son.

1330
01:46:25.629 --> 01:46:26.972
Get in. Get in.

1331
01:46:31.802 --> 01:46:34.601
One minute to total evacuation.

1332
01:46:39.059 --> 01:46:40.311
This one.

1333
01:46:43.814 --> 01:46:45.612
Forty-five seconds.

1334
01:46:48.819 --> 01:46:50.446
Get her strapped in.

1335
01:46:55.326 --> 01:46:58.205
Korben, Korben. Korben, my man,
you know how to fly this thing?

1336
01:46:58.370 --> 01:46:59.622
Just like driving a cab.

1337
01:47:04.376 --> 01:47:06.174
But the door?
How we gonna get out the door?

1338
01:47:19.683 --> 01:47:21.526
Fifteen seconds.

1339
01:47:26.315 --> 01:47:29.865
Ten, nine, eight...

1340
01:47:30.027 --> 01:47:34.498
...seven, six, five...

1341
01:47:51.340 --> 01:47:53.183
For the honor.

1342
01:47:57.179 --> 01:47:58.305
Oh, no.

1343
01:47:58.931 --> 01:48:00.183
You should hold on.

1344
01:48:13.195 --> 01:48:14.367
Come on.

1345
01:48:22.538 --> 01:48:23.755
Like driving a cab.

1346
01:48:25.749 --> 01:48:28.423
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is now 7 p.m. Time for the news.

1347
01:48:28.585 --> 01:48:30.553
See you tomorrow
for a new adventure.

1348
01:48:30.921 --> 01:48:32.594
End of transmission.

1349
01:48:33.549 --> 01:48:35.551
That's the best show I ever did.

1350
01:48:38.345 --> 01:48:41.189
Mr. President, Major Dallas has
the five elements on board...

1351
01:48:41.348 --> 01:48:44.101
...and the priest is guiding them
directly to the temple.

1352
01:48:48.731 --> 01:48:50.074
We're saved.

1353
01:49:06.248 --> 01:49:08.922
The diva said
that I should take care of you.

1354
01:49:09.918 --> 01:49:12.546
Humans act so strange.

1355
01:49:12.713 --> 01:49:13.930
What do you mean?

1356
01:49:15.632 --> 01:49:17.634
Everything you created...

1357
01:49:17.801 --> 01:49:19.428
...is used to destroy.

1358
01:49:19.803 --> 01:49:21.476
Yeah.

1359
01:49:21.638 --> 01:49:25.313
We call it human nature.
You learn about that on your screen?

1360
01:49:25.476 --> 01:49:28.320
I'm not finished yet. I'm up to V.

1361
01:49:29.146 --> 01:49:30.489
V is good.

1362
01:49:30.939 --> 01:49:32.816
Some very good words in V.

1363
01:49:32.983 --> 01:49:34.280
Like what?

1364
01:49:36.612 --> 01:49:37.955
Valiant.

1365
01:49:38.530 --> 01:49:40.032
Vulnerable.

1366
01:49:42.159 --> 01:49:43.832
Very beautiful.

1367
01:49:55.631 --> 01:49:58.134
Oh, of course, Munro!

1368
01:49:59.468 --> 01:50:01.971
- Mr. President?
- Yes, now what?

1369
01:50:02.137 --> 01:50:04.014
I... I...

1370
01:50:05.307 --> 01:50:06.684
We have a problem.

1371
01:50:12.189 --> 01:50:13.532
What do you mean,
it's advancing?

1372
01:50:13.690 --> 01:50:17.411
It's moving at incredible speed.
We're having trouble following it.

1373
01:50:21.824 --> 01:50:25.169
And do you have any idea
where it's heading?

1374
01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.879
Korben, there's a general
on the phone.

1375
01:50:35.712 --> 01:50:37.885
I'll give you to the president.

1376
01:50:38.549 --> 01:50:41.519
Major Dallas, I first would like
to salute a warrior.

1377
01:50:41.677 --> 01:50:43.395
You're a shining example
of this army's might.

1378
01:50:43.554 --> 01:50:45.227
- Mr. President.
- In the name of the Federation...

1379
01:50:45.389 --> 01:50:46.891
- ...and its territories...
- Any idea when you're gonna be...

1380
01:50:47.057 --> 01:50:48.183
...getting to the point?

1381
01:50:50.561 --> 01:50:55.362
Okay. There's a ball of fire 1200 miles
in diameter heading straight for Earth...

1382
01:50:55.524 --> 01:50:58.869
...and we have no idea how to stop it.
That's the problem.

1383
01:51:02.197 --> 01:51:03.699
How much time do we have?

1384
01:51:04.700 --> 01:51:08.204
If its speed remains constant,
in an hour and 57 minutes.

1385
01:51:09.246 --> 01:51:11.248
I'll call you back in two hours.

1386
01:51:11.415 --> 01:51:14.419
Hello? Hello? Hello?

1387
01:52:24.321 --> 01:52:26.289
They just landed in the desert.

1388
01:52:28.659 --> 01:52:30.206
Good job, David.

1389
01:52:31.912 --> 01:52:34.165
- Put her in the center.
- Where? Here?

1390
01:52:41.922 --> 01:52:43.674
You got it figured out, Father?

1391
01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:46.389
This one should be fire.

1392
01:52:46.551 --> 01:52:48.519
- You know how all this works?
- Theoretically, yes.

1393
01:52:48.679 --> 01:52:52.149
- Theoretically?
- The four stones should go around.

1394
01:52:52.307 --> 01:52:54.355
The fifth element should be
in the middle...

1395
01:52:54.518 --> 01:52:57.647
...and then the weapon
against evil should work.

1396
01:52:57.813 --> 01:52:59.565
You've never seen this work before,
have you?

1397
01:52:59.731 --> 01:53:01.358
No.

1398
01:53:01.525 --> 01:53:04.950
Every weapon has a manual.
I'm sure this has one too.

1399
01:53:13.245 --> 01:53:16.044
That's it. That's it.
Match up the symbols. Go! Go!

1400
01:53:17.708 --> 01:53:18.755
Wind.

1401
01:53:20.627 --> 01:53:22.675
My man, what you doing?

1402
01:53:22.838 --> 01:53:24.761
- What?
- What you doing?

1403
01:53:25.966 --> 01:53:27.764
Trying to keep you
in the DJ business.

1404
01:53:31.471 --> 01:53:32.563
Fire.

1405
01:53:34.016 --> 01:53:35.108
Done.

1406
01:53:35.267 --> 01:53:39.113
- So, what happens now?
- So now, we have to open them.

1407
01:53:40.230 --> 01:53:43.609
- And you know how to do that, right?
- Theoretically...

1408
01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:46.452
- ...no.
- No.

1409
01:53:51.283 --> 01:53:54.036
Leeloo, wake up, honey, wake up.
You have to help us.

1410
01:53:54.202 --> 01:53:57.081
Leeloo. How do you open these stones?

1411
01:53:58.290 --> 01:54:00.258
Wind blows.

1412
01:54:01.752 --> 01:54:03.299
Fire burns.

1413
01:54:03.462 --> 01:54:06.807
Yes, I know all that.
But how do you open these stones?

1414
01:54:07.132 --> 01:54:08.429
Rain...

1415
01:54:11.803 --> 01:54:13.271
...falls.

1416
01:54:16.767 --> 01:54:18.440
Leeloo. Leeloo.

1417
01:54:19.770 --> 01:54:21.113
What does it mean?

1418
01:54:22.939 --> 01:54:24.236
I think that...

1419
01:54:24.399 --> 01:54:25.776
- Maybe it's a charade.
- What?

1420
01:54:25.942 --> 01:54:27.285
A game or something.

1421
01:54:27.444 --> 01:54:30.197
If we don't get these stones open
in five minutes, we're all dead.

1422
01:54:30.364 --> 01:54:31.911
- Dead?
- Yes, dead.

1423
01:54:44.544 --> 01:54:45.841
Too late.

1424
01:54:47.631 --> 01:54:50.805
- We've lost contact with them.
- Three minutes.

1425
01:54:52.302 --> 01:54:55.306
I think mine is broken.
Why I gotta get the broke one?

1426
01:55:03.814 --> 01:55:05.487
We're never gonna make it.

1427
01:55:10.445 --> 01:55:12.994
Korben. Korben, it moved!

1428
01:55:14.449 --> 01:55:15.826
What'd you do?
Show me what you did.

1429
01:55:15.992 --> 01:55:18.336
- Nothing.
- Shut up, shut up!

1430
01:55:18.495 --> 01:55:21.465
Calm down. Show me what you did.
Take me through it, step by step.

1431
01:55:21.623 --> 01:55:23.842
- I was just standing here like this.
- Quickly.

1432
01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:28.346
Okay, and I put my hands on the top
like this, and I said:

1433
01:55:29.214 --> 01:55:31.182
"We're not gonna make it."

1434
01:55:32.843 --> 01:55:34.095
That's it?

1435
01:55:42.853 --> 01:55:44.196
RUBY:
Korben, my man.

1436
01:55:44.855 --> 01:55:46.323
Wind.

1437
01:55:46.731 --> 01:55:49.029
She said, "Wind... Wind blows."

1438
01:55:56.908 --> 01:55:58.410
Everyone take a stone.

1439
01:55:58.743 --> 01:56:01.713
Water for water. Fire for fire.
Earth for earth. Go, now!

1440
01:56:04.124 --> 01:56:05.341
Earth.

1441
01:56:05.500 --> 01:56:07.047
- Open the other one.
- Okay.

1442
01:56:20.265 --> 01:56:22.438
K... Korben.

1443
01:56:22.893 --> 01:56:25.271
Korben, my man, I have no fire.

1444
01:56:25.437 --> 01:56:27.656
I have no matches.
Do you have any matches?

1445
01:56:27.814 --> 01:56:30.192
I stopped smoking. If I knew...
I mean... Father, you smoke?

1446
01:56:30.358 --> 01:56:33.077
Got some matches? Matches?
We need some fire.

1447
01:56:34.362 --> 01:56:36.080
We all gonna die.

1448
01:56:43.288 --> 01:56:44.756
Don't breathe.

1449
01:57:03.975 --> 01:57:05.101
Fire.

1450
01:57:05.810 --> 01:57:06.936
One minute.

1451
01:57:07.103 --> 01:57:08.605
Let's go. Let's go. Leeloo.

1452
01:57:08.772 --> 01:57:11.821
Wake up. Wake up.
It's time for you to work now.

1453
01:57:12.526 --> 01:57:14.119
Protect life...

1454
01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:16.572
...until death.

1455
01:57:16.738 --> 01:57:19.617
No, no, Leeloo! Listen to me!
Listen to me. Listen.

1456
01:57:19.783 --> 01:57:22.457
Listen, I know you're very tired.
I know you're very tired.

1457
01:57:22.619 --> 01:57:26.419
I'll take you on a vacation when
we're done. I swear, just you and me.

1458
01:57:26.581 --> 01:57:29.960
But if you don't do something right now,
we're all gonna die. You understand?

1459
01:57:30.126 --> 01:57:34.051
What's the use of saving life
when you see what you do with it?

1460
01:57:34.214 --> 01:57:36.808
It'll be entering the atmosphere
in 40 seconds.

1461
01:57:38.218 --> 01:57:39.811
Leeloo, you're right.

1462
01:57:39.970 --> 01:57:41.813
But there are some things...

1463
01:57:41.972 --> 01:57:44.646
...very nice things worth saving,
some beautiful things.

1464
01:57:45.141 --> 01:57:47.018
Beautiful things.

1465
01:57:47.978 --> 01:57:49.446
Like love?

1466
01:57:49.604 --> 01:57:51.606
Yes, love. That's good. That's good.

1467
01:57:51.773 --> 01:57:54.572
That's a good example.
Like love. Love is worth saving.

1468
01:57:55.151 --> 01:57:56.994
I don't know love.

1469
01:57:58.863 --> 01:58:00.240
I don't know love.

1470
01:58:00.407 --> 01:58:02.705
I was built to protect, not to love.

1471
01:58:02.867 --> 01:58:05.711
So there's no use for me
other than this.

1472
01:58:05.870 --> 01:58:08.293
No, no, no, you're wrong.
You're wrong. You're wrong.

1473
01:58:08.999 --> 01:58:12.003
I need you. I need you, very much.

1474
01:58:13.753 --> 01:58:14.970
Why?

1475
01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:19.935
Because...

1476
01:58:20.844 --> 01:58:23.347
Tell her, Korben.

1477
01:58:24.681 --> 01:58:27.400
Tell me. Please.

1478
01:58:27.559 --> 01:58:29.402
Why do you need me?

1479
01:58:30.145 --> 01:58:33.024
- Because...
- Tell me.

1480
01:58:35.191 --> 01:58:36.693
- Tell me.
- Because I...

1481
01:58:36.860 --> 01:58:38.362
Because I love you.

1482
01:58:39.571 --> 01:58:40.914
I love you.

1483
01:58:44.951 --> 01:58:49.081
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

1484
01:58:49.623 --> 01:58:53.048
...six, five, four, three...

1485
01:58:53.418 --> 01:58:55.841
...two, one.

1486
01:59:33.833 --> 01:59:37.963
Scanner imaging
has confirmed the dark planet: dead.

1487
01:59:38.630 --> 01:59:41.509
The planet seems to have stopped
at 62 miles from impact.

1488
01:59:53.061 --> 01:59:54.404
Yes!

1489
01:59:54.562 --> 01:59:56.690
What's wrong with you?
What you screaming for?

1490
01:59:56.856 --> 01:59:59.200
Every five minutes, it's something.
A bomb or something.

1491
01:59:59.359 --> 02:00:01.782
I'm leaving. Bzz!

1492
02:00:15.375 --> 02:00:16.592
Mr. President.

1493
02:00:16.751 --> 02:00:19.504
Let me introduce you to Professor
Mactilburgh who runs the center.

1494
02:00:19.671 --> 02:00:21.469
It's an honor to receive you,
Mr. President.

1495
02:00:21.631 --> 02:00:23.258
Yes, well...
Where are my two heroes?

1496
02:00:23.425 --> 02:00:27.225
Oh, they were so tired from their ordeal,
we put them in the reactor this morning.

1497
02:00:27.387 --> 02:00:29.310
I have 19 more meetings after this one.

1498
02:00:29.472 --> 02:00:31.895
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Let me see if they're revived.

1499
02:00:32.058 --> 02:00:33.184
Thank you.

1500
02:00:33.351 --> 02:00:34.898
We go live in one minute,
Mr. President.

1501
02:00:35.061 --> 02:00:36.483
Mm-hm.

1502
02:00:42.277 --> 02:00:43.654
Ah...

1503
02:00:43.820 --> 02:00:45.322
They're...

1504
02:00:46.531 --> 02:00:48.454
...not ready.

1505
02:00:48.616 --> 02:00:49.868
They need...

1506
02:00:50.034 --> 02:00:52.833
- ...five more minutes.
- You have 20 seconds.

1507
02:00:52.996 --> 02:00:55.169
No, ma'am.
No, no, I tried. No, ma'am.

1508
02:00:55.331 --> 02:00:56.457
Who's that?

1509
02:00:56.624 --> 02:00:58.217
Some woman.
Claims to be Korben's mother.

1510
02:00:58.376 --> 02:01:00.128
Well, give it here.

1511
02:01:00.670 --> 02:01:05.346
Mrs. Dallas, this is the president.
On behalf of the Federation...

1512
02:01:05.508 --> 02:01:07.510
Please, that doesn't even sound like him.

1513
02:01:07.677 --> 02:01:09.850
The president's an idiot.
You don't sound like an idiot.

1514
02:01:10.013 --> 02:01:12.766
If you don't want to talk to your mother,
just avoid me like usual.

1515
02:01:12.932 --> 02:01:16.903
I'll just throw myself in traffic.
I'll just Saran Wrap myself to the bed...
