{7511}{7641}Cameron Poe, you have pleaded guilty|to manslaughter in the first degree.
{7643}{7713}With your military skills,|you are a deadly weapon...
{7715}{7792}and are not subject to the same laws|as other people that are provoked...
{7794}{7854}because you can respond|with deadly force.
{7856}{7955}lt is the order of this court that you|be remanded to a federal penitentiary...
{7957}{8083}where you shall remain incarcerated|for a term not less than 7 to 10 years.
{8168}{8285}"Con Air"|action-thriller, USA, 1997
{8303}{8346}Hello, pretty girl.
{8349}{8402}Come, come. Bring it here. Hey! Hey!
{8482}{8599}Dearest Tricia, l think of you always.|Your smile, your laugh.
{8602}{8694}l'm not angry. The blame's|gotta fall on me.
{8695}{8783}l am, however, torn apart|when l think that l won't...
{8786}{8847}be there to see our child|come into the world...
{8850}{8921}cradled in your arms,|and her first smile.
{8963}{9019}l got your package.|Those pink coconut things...
{9022}{9078}have made me quite popular.
{9079}{9197}Met a guy just the other day.|Baby-O. He sure does love 'em.
{9251}{9330}And now our daughter, beautiful Casey.
{9331}{9390}l watch her grow|in the pictures you send.
{9391}{9458}l showed 'em to Baby-O.|His reaction was simple.
{9459}{9522}He said, ''Thank God|she looks like her mama.''
{9523}{9582}l'd have to agree.
{9583}{9673}lt's funny, but here l am in maybe|the worst place on earth, and yet...
{9675}{9734}somehow l feel like|the luckiest man alive.
{9898}{10013}Dear Daddy, l started today at|the Little Sunshine Day Care Center.
{10015}{10085}My teacher is Miss Gordon. She is nice.
{10087}{10169}We go to playtime, and we all have|to hold hands when we walk there.
{10171}{10247}Dear Casey, it was so good|to read your letter.
{10250}{10297}l'm glad you like your teacher.
{10299}{10358}We don't exactly have|a playtime like you.
{10361}{10465}We do go outside, though. But|normally, we don't hold hands.
{10559}{10650}My wife and l will have|our Margaritas on the yacht.
{10817}{10894}Dear Daddy, today was|my first day at first grade.
{10895}{10993}l didn't like it. l don't want|to go back tomorrow.
{10995}{11103}This boy, Scotty Dalton, has|black teeth and calls me names.
{11106}{11198}Mama says l have to go back.|Tell her not to make me.
{11199}{11314}Dear Casey, hopefully this finds you|still goin' to the first grade.
{11315}{11418}School is very important.|Your mama's right.
{11419}{11495}Now, don't you worry|about little Scotty Dalton.
{11498}{11589}Sometimes you meet people like that,|but don't let 'em get you down.
{11691}{11798}Dear Daddy, are you ever comin' home?
{11801}{11873}Dear Casey, of course l'm comin' home.
{11875}{11954}ln just a little while longer, and all|the things we missed doin' together...
{11957}{12005}you can be sure we'll do.
{12007}{12114}Dear Hummingbird, break out|the fine china, chill the lemonade...
{12115}{12170}tie a yellow ribbon|'round the old oak tree...
{12171}{12266}'cause this boy's comin' home to|his ladies, comin' home forever.
{12269}{12377}l just hope l'm not a disappointment|to Casey or to you.
{12379}{12447}Love, Cameron.
{12449}{12527}''My daddy is coming home|on July 14th.

{12709}{12798}l can't wait to meet you, honey. lsn't|that the cutest thing you ever heard?
{12801}{12850}Yeah, man.
{12890}{12950}Hey, now,|what is this?
{12952}{13052}l can't see my little daughter|on her birthday without bringin'|her a gift, now can l?
{13054}{13111}Yeah, man,|but that's a bunny rabbit.
{13113}{13168}That's all right. l mean,|she'll like it, right? l mean, what?
{13170}{13254}lt's either this or a tube|of toothpaste and two packs|of Pall Malls at the canteen.
{13256}{13376}- Now, that's a present.|- l'll remember that on your birthday.
{13378}{13433}Yeah, you do that, man.
{13550}{13641}''lt having been made to appear to|the United States Parole Commission...
{13643}{13736}Cameron Poe is eligible|to be paroled.""
{13738}{13830}Shit, might be a long time before l see|somethin' like that with my name on it.
{13994}{14105}- You'll get your own date|someday, Baby-O.|- l ain't worried about that, man.
{14107}{14193}Yeah, but like at this new prison you're|goin' to, who's gonna watch your back?
{14195}{14272}God's got my back.|You know what l'm sayin'?
{14322}{14376}l'm goin' home, son!
{14378}{14442}Wait, don't be gettin' all juicy|on me, all right? Get off me.
{14487}{14533}Step out.
{14613}{14686}Good-bye. Good night.
{14882}{14945}The U.S. Marshal Service|annually flies...
{14947}{15025}155,000 prisoners|around the country...
{15027}{15100}for transfers, legal hearings|and medical exams.
{15102}{15198}As you know, today's flight|is a special one.
{15201}{15281}We're populating Alabama's|Feltham Penitentiary...
{15283}{15356}the newest super-max facility|in the system.
{15358}{15436}This place was designed|to warehouse the worst of the worst.
{15438}{15530}Now, most of these guys|are lifers, some on death row.
{15532}{15628}Pure predators,|each and every one of them.
{15689}{15765}- Hey, lady!|- Lady's a dog in a Walt Disney movie.
{15767}{15826}My name is Bishop.|Guard Bishop to you.
{15829}{15913}Well, l gotta be gettin' my shot|before we go gettin' on|some airplane, Guard Bishop.
{15915}{16017}- What's your name?|- Odell. They didn't give me|my shot last night.
{16019}{16134}Okay, you're diabetic? All|right, your insulin's on board.|We'll give it to you in flight.
{16162}{16210}- Cameron Poe.|- Yes, ma'am.
{16212}{16256}You know you're still under full|restraints till you're processed...
{16258}{16309}and released from your original|prison, understand?
{16311}{16389}Yes, ma'am. As long as l make it home|on time, it makes no never mind.
{16391}{16458}- lt's my daughter's birthday.|- Well, congratulations.
{16460}{16556}l got locked down three months before|she was born. She ain't never seen me.
{16558}{16615}- And why not?|- No way was she gonna meet her daddy...
{16617}{16706}in a prison visitor room|surrounded by homemade cookies and...
{16709}{16769}and love-starved murderers.
{16771}{16876}- No way.|- What you got here is a walking,|talking reason to rehabilitate.
{16963}{17081}So today let's exemplify|our three operative words:
{17083}{17160}firm, fair and vigilant.
{17187}{17229}Now, let's go to work.
{17231}{17290}We off-load six in Carson City,|the rest are sheeted to Feltham.
{17293}{17345}Good. Let's go deal|with the DEA boys.
{17447}{17485}- You know this guy?|- Haven't had the pleasure.
{17487}{17541}He's a piece of work,|a real piece of work.
{17579}{17648}Duncan, good to see you.|She sure is beautiful.
{17650}{17737}Hey, beautiful? Sunsets are beautiful.|Newborn babies are beautiful.
{17739}{17788}This, this is|fucking spectacular!
{17790}{17865}Duncan, this is Vince Larkin.|He's overseeing the transpo.
{17867}{17941}Vince,|Duncan Malloy, DEA.
{17943}{18032}Nice to meet ya. l'm sure|we're gonna have a good time|working on this together.
{18421}{18489}- Hey, Willie.|- Boys!|- How ya doin'?|- What's up, Chief?
{18491}{18551}- You know each other?|- Vince Larkin.|- Sims, DEA. Good to meet you, Larkin.
{18553}{18599}This is our file on your man,|Francisco Cindino, son of Eduardo...
{18600}{18639}prime mover of narcotics|from Colombia.
{18641}{18715}lt's gonna be|an all-star flight.
{18717}{18779}This kid's a potential fountain of|information about the family business.
{18781}{18830}- Eleven and a half okay?|- Yeah.
{18832}{18886}Look at him.|Nice college boy, right?
{18888}{18935}We interrogated him for months.|He gave up nothing.
{18936}{18989}This is our last chance|before the FBl gets him.
{18991}{19040}Over my dead body|those assholes get the glory.
{19042}{19098}We pick up Mr Cindino|in Carson City.
{19100}{19169}From then until the plane hits Alabama,|we've got two hours to get him to talk.
{19171}{19217}We got you a seat right next|to him, and he's known to be...
{19219}{19263}somewhat garrulous|in the company of thieves.
{19265}{19314}Garrulous?|What the fuck is garrulous?
{19316}{19410}That would be loquacious, verbose,|effusive. How about ''chatty''?
{19412}{19458}What's with dictionary boy,|here?
{19460}{19532}Thesaurus boy, l think,|is more appropriate.
{19534}{19584}- You got your gun?|- Yeah.
{19586}{19652}- Whoa, whoa. Gun?|- We got rules, gentlemen.
{19654}{19735}- Yeah. So do we. Our agents go armed.|- No one carries on this flight.
{19737}{19791}l've got a small arsenal|in the belly of the plane.
{19793}{19862}A pistol in the cockpit|lockbox. That's it.
{19864}{19910}Other than that, we keep|the plane like a prison.
{19912}{19960}No weapon|on the aircraft, period.
{19962}{20024}My man does not get on|that plane without his gun.
{20026}{20084}Then your man|doesn't get on the plane.
{20166}{20219}Okay, Willie,|give it to him.
{20250}{20298}Give him the gun.
{20458}{20507}- Avoid eye contact.|- l got it.
{20509}{20603}- ln the pen, it's a sign of aggression.|- Larkin, l got it.
{20605}{20655}Okay.
{20708}{20766}Foxtrot Charlie,|we are ready to disembark.
{20768}{20851}Waiting your go|on separatee transfer.
{20853}{20918}Well, we told you today's flight|would be special.
{20920}{21002}- That's William Bedford,|aka ''Billy Bedlam.''|- The mass murderer?
{21004}{21082}The same. He caught his wife in bed|with another man. Left her alone.
{21084}{21156}Drove four towns over|to his wife's family's house.
{21158}{21212}Killed her parents, her brothers, her|sisters, even her dog.
{21214}{21255}Scan him.
{21257}{21316}And who is that|good-looking brother on screen?
{21318}{21388}Nathan Jones,|aka ''Diamond Dog.''
{21390}{21447}Former general of|the Black Guerrillas.
{21449}{21506}He blew up a meeting of the National|Rifle Association saying...
{21508}{21595}and l quote, ''They represented the|basest negativity of the white race.''
{21597}{21694}He wrote a book in prison called|Reflections ln A Diamond Eye.
{21696}{21756}New York Times called it ''A wake-up|call for the black community.''
{21758}{21822}They're talking to Denzel|for the movie.
{22074}{22122}Close door number one.
{22186}{22234}This one's done it all.|Kidnapping...
{22236}{22294}robbery, murder,|extortion.
{22296}{22375}Foxtrot Charlie, perimeter is secured.|You are cleared to release.
{22426}{22531}His name is Cyrus Grissom,|aka ''Cyrus the Virus.''
{22533}{22615}Thirty-nine years old,|25 of them spent in our institutions.
{22617}{22707}But he's bettered himself inside. Earned|two degrees, including his Juris Doctor.
{22709}{22824}He also killed 11 fellow inmates,|incited three riots and escaped twice.
{22826}{22885}Likes to brag that he killed|more men than cancer.
{22887}{22929}Okay, open wide.
{22931}{22975}Lift your tongue.
{23037}{23144}Cyrus is a poster child|for the criminally insane. He's|a true product of the system.
{23146}{23242}What's that supposed to mean? Uh, what|is he, one of these sociology majors...
{23244}{23303}who thinks we're responsible|for breeding these animals?
{23305}{23379}No, but l could point a few fingers|if it would make you feel comfortable.
{23624}{23706}Ah, look at this walking penis.|Boy, you are one skinny Negro.
{23708}{23764}- Easy man. Shit.|- Open up.
{23766}{23824}Oh, man, it smells like|somebody shit in your mouth.
{23826}{23872}He told me he loved me.
{23874}{23942}- Get out of my face.|- All right, all right. Shit.
{24054}{24119}- Hey, Larkin, who's that guy?|- That is Cameron Poe.
{24121}{24204}A parolee hitchin' a ride home.|He's a nobody.
{24225}{24277}Okay, let's do it.
{24279}{24380}Willie, nobody on the plane knows|your classification, not even my guards.
{24439}{24476}- Guard Bishop.|- Hey, Larkin.
{24478}{24527}Tell me, Skip, is|the U.S. Marshal Service...
{24529}{24600}in the habit of employing|annoying, wiseass bookworm creeps?
{24602}{24641}Larkin's one of the best|we got.
{24644}{24726}Yeah, well, l'd still like to|crush his larynx with my boot.
{24799}{24849}Scan him.
{24851}{24892}Face me.
{24975}{25056}- What's this shit?|- lt's my daughter.
{25058}{25099}l don't care if it's|the weepin' mama of Christ.
{25101}{25149}There's no personal possessions|on this airplane.
{25152}{25210}Just as long as you know l'll be|gettin' that back at some point.
{25212}{25280}Are you tellin' me what l'm|gonna be doin' here, numb-nuts?
{25282}{25328}- You heard me.|- Hey, hey, hey.
{25330}{25376}Come on,|break it up.
{25450}{25551}Oh, now, look at this fashion statement.|The do-rag gotta go, homeboy.
{25609}{25676}- Right here.|- Attention, officers.
{25678}{25771}- Final check, all restraints.|- Sweet bird of freedom.
{25773}{25824}Take off|in three minutes.
{25826}{25928}What's up, man?|Oh, shit. What's up?
{25930}{25987}l thought you was someone else.|Pinball Parker.
{25989}{26097}Armed robber, arsonist, dope fiend. l'm|a hell of a nice guy. l just got caught.
{26100}{26173}Aw, shucks.
{26289}{26349}- All right, face me.|- l got him.
{26352}{26400}Come on.
{26450}{26496}Open.
{26680}{26728}You guys are late|for the party.
{26730}{26796}- Okay.|- Let's go, sweetheart.
{26933}{26981}What's up, Cochise?
{26984}{27037}How?
{27040}{27095}Hey, man, l'm just fuckin' with you,|all right? Don't get all...
{27097}{27166}''Wounded Knee'' on me|and shit.
{27217}{27262}You look like|you wanna scalp a nigger.
{27316}{27384}What you lookin' at,|punk?
{27386}{27473}Nothin'. l was just|admirin' your cage.
{27475}{27521}Fits you pretty good.
{27566}{27636}Well, welcome aboard.
{27638}{27701}My, my. As l look around l see|a lot of celebrities among us.
{27704}{27824}l see 11 Current Affairs,|two Hard Copies, and a genuine|Geraldo interviewee.
{27826}{27882}But l got to tell you,|gentlemen, none of this impresses me.
{27884}{27960}Because we have rules on this aircraft,|and they're gonna be enforced.
{27962}{28023}lt's a lot like kindergarten.|You'll keep your hands to yourself.
{28025}{28116}You keep the decibel level down.|And if any of you should feel|the need to scream...
{28118}{28184}spit or bite,|you get the treatment.
{28186}{28257}- Fuck you, pig.|- Gag and bag this Nazi muffin.
{28331}{28380}See, this kind of thing|puts me in a foul mood.
{28382}{28459}These rules will be enforced.|lf there's a hint of trouble...
{28461}{28563}if any of you so much as passes|gas in my direction, it offends|my delicate nasal passages...
{28565}{28673}your testicles will become|my personal property.
{28676}{28762}That's pretty clear.|Good.

{47259}{47333}- What about the loose shelf screw?|- What the hell is this?
{47335}{47382}Looks like cocaine.
{47489}{47582}- What, do you got something there?|- l don't know. lt's all soft.
{47695}{47745}What about the rest|of the pigs?
{47747}{47854}Be patient, now. They haven't|ceased to be useful yet.
{47855}{47917}Okay, old man.|Now you're Mr Popovitch.
{47919}{48007}Gentlemen, you'll reach the|Nevada pen in about two hours.
{48010}{48063}The tape's just a little|precaution in case any of you...
{48066}{48171}are rocked by the sudden impulse|to squeal like a pig.
{48174}{48266}Not that we don't trust you.|But let's face it, you're criminals.
{48319}{48389}- Come on, man, move your head up.|- l want to stay on.
{48391}{48430}What?

{49047}{49129}Get him up.|Get the cuffs off him.

{49255}{49321}- What the hell are you doin'?|- Stayin'.
{49323}{49391}They're gaggin' everybody|for the bus ride to the pen.
{49394}{49477}lt'll be hours before the Feds discover|what happened. By then you'll be dead.
{49479}{49609}- So will she.|- Poe, think of your little girl.
{49611}{49718}Now, what would my daughter|think of me if l left you like|this to get dishonored and die?
{49719}{49789}You keep acting like you're still|a Ranger, we're all gonna be in trouble.
{49791}{49866}You're not that guy anymore.|You're a convict.

{65589}{65638}What's the plan? You, uh,|you-you-you do have a plan, don't you?
{65641}{65686}We're workin' on it.
{65689}{65752}Contingency plans for something|like this don't exist.
{65754}{65825}-The situation's|never been contemplated.|-Well, you better start contemplating...
{65828}{65953}'cause this is a situation that|needs to get unfucked right now!
{65956}{66042}l want a chopper. Make that a few|of 'em. They need to be armed.
{66045}{66124}l don't care if it's National|Guard, Air Force, whatever.
{66125}{66173}Just get 'em here,|and get 'em here now.
{66265}{66321}- What do you want to do with him?|- l don't know.
{66322}{66417}But this is no way to treat|a national treasure. Let him out.
{66448}{66529}- You sure?|- Love your work.
{67253}{67336}They're headed southeast|toward Arizona.
{67530}{67625}- Pinball didn't make it.|- No?
{67628}{67716}That's too bad.|l liked Pinball.
{67718}{67796}- What do you want?|- l wanna know what the plan is.
{67797}{67857}Why you care?
{67858}{67950}l got just as much ridin' on this|as you. We're all convicts here.
{67953}{68000}Cyrus Grissom,|do you copy?
{68002}{68052}Cyrus Grissom,|do you copy?
{68053}{68128}Yes, l copy.|ldentify yourself.
{68129}{68221}This is United States Marshal Vince|Larkin and Duncan Malloy of the DEA.
{68222}{68308}Oh, Agent Malloy. l'm so sorry|about your associate.
{68310}{68394}Nothing is quite as sad as seeing|a grown man pissing his pants.
{68396}{68449}Listen, Grissom,|you puny, fucking animal!
{68452}{68516}When l get through with you, you'll be|beggin' 'em for the electric chair.
{68517}{68568}Hey, l don't like him.
{68569}{68641}lf he speaks again, this|conversation is terminated.
{68644}{68753}He doesn't want to talk again.|Really. He's done talking.|He's leaving the building, okay?
{68756}{68815}Good, then l'll talk to you.|Here are the rules.
{68817}{68884}First l ask a question,|then you ask a question.
{68885}{68925}Okay.|What's your question?
{68928}{69004}ln Carson City, your bulls|were onto us. How?
{69005}{69084}- One of the guards--|- One of the guards--
{69085}{69180}One of the guards faked a heart attack|and we had to remove his restraints.
{69183}{69232}All right?
{69233}{69280}l see.|And what's your question?
{69281}{69336}Where you goin'|with my plane, Cyrus?
{69337}{69409}- We're going to Disneyland.|- You're lying, Cyrus.
{69412}{69512}So are you, Vince.|Oh, nothin'
{69513}{69620}Makes me sadder than the agent|lost his bladder in the
{69621}{69677}Airplane
{69736}{69824}Lerner Airfield, Poe. Middle of nowhere.|That's our rendezvous point.
{69825}{69907}Forty-nine minutes from anything|resembling authority.
{69909}{69968}So, now you know.
{69969}{70035}Your attention, please.|Flight 475--
{70037}{70124}You excited? Yeah?|Sure look pretty.
{70269}{70332}- Mrs. Poe?|- That's right.
{70333}{70396}My name's Grant,|U.S. Marshal Service.
{70399}{70492}There's been a slight problem|on your husband's flight.|Your presence is requested.
{70493}{70557}l have a jet|standing by.
{70705}{70797}Yee-ha!|What's on your mind, hillbilly?
{70799}{70881}What was l thinking about?
{70883}{70944}Oh, yeah. Yee-ha.|That's right.
{70945}{71040}l was just wonderin' what a black|militant, uh, that would be you...
{71043}{71125}was doin' takin' orders from|a white boy on a power trip.
{71128}{71223}-Don't you think that's strange?|-lt's a means to an end,|my white friend.
{71228}{71284}A means to an end.|See...
{71285}{71368}l's can play house nigger till's|we get to where we're goin'.
{71369}{71476}And then,|the day of the dog begins.
{71692}{71748}So what was that|all about?
{71749}{71816}Oh, nothin',|except they somehow managed...
{71817}{71920}to get every creep and freak|in the universe onto this one plane...
{71921}{72019}and then somehow managed|to let them take it over...
{72021}{72120}and then somehow managed to stick us|right smack in the middle.
{72289}{72328}Hi, Garland.
{72399}{72493}Here's the jacket on Cameron Poe.|His wife's on the way here now.
{72494}{72541}U.S. Ranger,|highly decorated.
{72543}{72587}Did a little hell-raising when|he was a kid, but nothing serious.
{72589}{72644}Explain to me|why any of this matters.
{72645}{72705}Fact one. We got a plane up there filled|with killers, rapists and thieves...
{72708}{72780}and we got this guy Cameron Poe,|in on an involuntary manslaughter beef.
{72781}{72853}Non-gang affiliated. He's|a parolee hitchin' a ride home.
{72855}{72940}Fact two. Poe has a chance|to get off the plane.
{72943}{73003}Doesn't do it. Why?
{73005}{73092}Fact three. Our guard, Falzon,|said a convict named Cameron Poe...
{73095}{73149}planted Sims's|tape recorder on him.
{73153}{73262}These are interesting facts.|You do the math on this, and|we got an ally on that plane.
{73264}{73350}Ally? This guy is a criminal.|A murderer.
{73351}{73465}Read the file. Got in a drunken brawl|defending his wife and he killed a guy.
{73466}{73496}Could have happened to any one|of us, including you and me.
{73497}{73538}l am not one|of these animals.
{73540}{73604}Oh, that's original! When exactly|did they all become animals?
{73606}{73683}When they stopped giving a damn|about the law, about civilization.
{73685}{73779}''The degree of civilization|in a society can be judged|by observing its prisoners.''
{73781}{73851}Dostoevsky said that|after doing a little time.
{73853}{73967}''Fuck you!'' Cyrus Grissom|said that after putting a bullet|in my agent's head. Okay?
{73969}{74027}The issue here is how the plane|is brought down.
{74029}{74076}Shoot it down.
{74078}{74174}Yeah. When exactly did this|become a DEA jurisdiction?
{74176}{74239}The second the DEA agent|was murdered.
{74241}{74307}l am authorized to bring Agent Sims's|killers to justice using...
{74309}{74380}and l quote,|''All necessary means.''
{74382}{74452}- That does not include|shooting down my plane.|- Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.
{74454}{74520}ls that right? Tell me you're|not seriously entertaining this.
{74522}{74587}Vince, this is|a drastic situation we got.
{74589}{74672}-Those are our men up there!|-All of whom signed a no-hostage|clause. They know the score.
{74675}{74757}Who are you to decide the value|of a man's life? There are|innocent people up there!
{74759}{74843}About time.
{74845}{74931}-For what? About time for what?|-Attack choppers. We're going after 'em.
{75066}{75143}Goddamn it!|Skip, don't do this!
{75145}{75216}This man is in an irrational state|of mind! His head isn't on straight.
{75219}{75311}Fuck off, Marshal Larkin.|Your job's finished. This flight's full.
{75533}{75647}Gentlemen, in roughly|five hours, we will be flying|over the shores of Mexico.
{75650}{75719}But first we have|to change aircraft.
{75722}{75779}Thank you, and have|a pleasant flight.
{75780}{75903}- What's the ETA, Swamp Thing?|- At 228 miles an hour,|about 71 minutes.
{75904}{75992}The only problem is, we're not doing|228 miles an hour. We're doing 205.
{75995}{76083}We're draggin', baby.|The landing gear ain't all|the way up. We're gonna be late.
{76084}{76167}- No, no, no. Cyrus,|that's unacceptable.|- Check out the gear.
{76168}{76235}- What the hell do l know|about landing gear?|- Learn.
{76312}{76360}Hillbilly!
{76362}{76407}Poe.
{76518}{76611}- Yeah?|- Cyrus wants you to check out|the landing gear.
{76614}{76687}Then l'll get to see some nice|scenery whippin' by down there.
{76818}{76863}Trees and stuff.
{77348}{77423}Goddamn! So that's|what happened to Pinball.
{77424}{77503}Cut him loose. He's slowin'|us down. Dead weight.
{77504}{77567}Not exactly|a proper burial.
{77570}{77628}Look at our shit|over there.
{78111}{78144}Hurry up.
{78206}{78255}Hillbilly.
{78258}{78296}Gotcha.
{78327}{78387}Hurry up, man.
{78526}{78572}Bye, Pinball.
{78911}{78983}Oh, boy! You see that?|You see?
{78986}{79107}Every time we get her waxed,|l get ten feet from the car wash|and then, pow, bird shit.
{79110}{79191}Well, it's supposed to be|good luck.
{79242}{79302}- Light's changed.|- Oh, damn.
{79857}{79911}- You were in the ''Q,'' right?|- Yeah.
{79913}{79996}And l heard you say|you had 15 years.
{80027}{80067}That's right.
{80068}{80167}But then that would put you|on north block. Right?
{80169}{80240}Yeah.
{80243}{80304}Yeah. Funny thing.
{80307}{80423}l was on north block.|l don't know you.
{80425}{80507}Well, you know what,|uh, pal?
{80508}{80619}What do you think that means?|Nothin'. Not diddly shit.
{80621}{80679}You see, there were 160 cats|on north block...
{80680}{80787}and l didn't want to know 159|of them, which included you.
{80788}{80848}What do you think|about that?
{80849}{80896}Yeah.
{81088}{81152}He's a font|of misplaced rage.
{81155}{81260}Name your cliche. Mother held|him too much, or not enough.
{81263}{81328}Last picked at kick ball,|late-night sneaky uncle. Whatever.
{81373}{81464}Now he's so angry, moments of|levity actually cause him pain.
{81492}{81531}Gives him headaches.
{81532}{81596}Happiness, for|that gentleman, hurts.
{81623}{81672}What's wrong with him?
{81675}{81751}My first thought would be|a lot.
{81817}{81857}- Hello.|- Hello.
{81860}{81913}- Hi. l'm, l'm Vince Larkin.|- l'm Tricia Poe.
{81916}{82001}Nice to meet ya.|This, this must be Casey.
{82004}{82071}- Hello, Casey.|- Hello, Vince Larkin.|- Nice to meet ya.
{82097}{82144}So how are you doin'?
{82147}{82203}l'm sorry. That's, uh-- Scratch|that. Dumb question. You--
{82205}{82288}You wanted to see your husband today,|and then this whole thing happened.
{82291}{82371}Maybe you could just tell me|exactly what's going on here and--
{82372}{82444}We're doing everything we can|to get the plane down.
{82445}{82519}Actually, that's w-why l wanted|to talk to you.
{82621}{82680}Hey, wait. W-Where'd you get|the rims, man?
{82683}{82755}My personal shit's|down in the belly.
{82799}{82861}- Hey, those are my shades.|- They're mine now, sister.
{82864}{82911}Men!
{83059}{83151}lt seems that your husband,|Cameron...
{83153}{83211}had an opportunity to get off|the plane and he didn't do it.
{83212}{83275}And l was hoping|you could...
{83277}{83363}maybe help me|figure out why.
{83365}{83447}That would make two of us.|l don't know.
{83448}{83497}l mean, it's possible,|it's, it's not uncommon...
{83500}{83593}that some parolees actually fear|their release date.
{83596}{83683}A certain degree of institutionalization|sets in. Fear of coming home.
{83685}{83745}- Fear of living in society.|Any of this make sense?|- No, no.
{83748}{83839}That's not Cameron. l mean, if you, if|you knew him, if you read his letters...
{83840}{83907}or if you talked to him|on the phone, you'd know that--
{83909}{84011}l mean, he's been waitin' for this day|for eight years. He's not gonna--
{84069}{84179}l mean, look, he's got this little,|this little girl to come home to.
{84224}{84279}Wouldn't you...
{84281}{84331}do the same thing?
{84400}{84475}There'd have to be a pretty strong|reason to keep me on that plane.
{84477}{84551}Well, knowing Cameron,|l'm sure there is a good reason.
{84603}{84717}Uh, maybe, if you, if you do|see him or if you talk to him...
{84720}{84820}maybe you could just tell him|to come home, all right?
{84823}{84881}Be kinda nice|to have him around.
{84904}{84952}You got it.
{84977}{85029}Vince, line one.
{85085}{85135}This body fell out|of the sky.
{85136}{85239}Vince Larkin? This is Ted Grasso,|Fresno Police Department.
{85241}{85297}We got a problem here|with a corpse.
{85332}{85372}Yeah, it fell out|of the sky.
{85375}{85421}l don't think|he's an astronaut.
{85424}{85496}Then what's this got|to do with me?
{85499}{85563}lt's got your name|written all over it.
{85691}{85759}Last transponder tag|was in Arizona.
{85760}{85817}Body falls here,|in Fresno.
{85820}{85887}Lerner Airfield.|They're turning around.
{85888}{85927}- They're coming back.|Can you get me Chief--|- Devers.
{85929}{85976}Please. Thank you.
{85979}{86033}- Vince?|- Turn around.
{86036}{86103}Plane's headed to Lerner Airfield. lt's|a small strip about 100 miles from here.
{86105}{86196}Horseshit! We're tailing the|transponder tag into Arizona.
{86199}{86255}Listen to me.|A body fell from the sky.
{86256}{86315}lt had a note on it.
{86316}{86388}We got 'em vectored|at 12:00 and 30 miles.
{86391}{86487}- Vince, please, son.|We're right on his tail.|- Just listen to me!
{86489}{86547}lt was to me!|The note on the body was to me!
{86548}{86601}- You're chasing the wrong--|- Aw, shut up.
{86604}{86635}Hello?
{86676}{86739}Guys, guys! l need a plane|or a chopper now!
{86740}{86800}Hey, you and me both.|l'm all out.
{86801}{86867}l've got to get to Lerner Airfield|and l've got about 50 minutes.
{86868}{86920}Got a fast car,|you can drive it.
{87015}{87073}Larkin. Vince Larkin.|l'm with the Marshal Services.
{87076}{87139}Send whatever you got. Sheriff,|state trooper, national guard.
{87140}{87199}Hold on one minute.
{87265}{87325}Your men should proceed|with extreme caution.
{87328}{87387}lt's only a matter of time|before they find the weapons hold.
{87493}{87557}Larkin. Vince Larkin.|Marshal Services.
{87560}{87605}How do you think|l got the number?
{87745}{87828}''...appears to the United States|Parole Commission that--''
{87866}{87917}Poe.
{87920}{88000}Man! Oh, yeah!
{88040}{88100}Put the bunny|back in the box.
{88149}{88235}l knew you was a punk.|And l was right.
{88237}{88313}You been playin' us|all along.
{88315}{88376}You a free man.
{88378}{88471}l said, put the bunny...
{88473}{88533}back in the box.
{89280}{89333}Die, punk!
{89528}{89623}Why couldn't you put the bunny|back in the box?
{89681}{89769}Next, folks, below and to your left,|you'll see the vertical Renoir Cliffs.
{89838}{89912}We're seconds away from|establishing visual contact.
{89958}{90025}Holy shit!
{90027}{90103}Abort! Abort! Abort!
{90105}{90221}lf that aircraft's carrying|30 prisoners, l'm Elvis Presley.
{90246}{90315}''Uncle Bob's Scenic Tours.''
{90356}{90434}Shit!
{90436}{90530}Three hundred fuckin' miles|to apprehend Ma and Pa fucking Kettle!
{90532}{90600}We need to get|to Lerner Airfield now!
{90602}{90655}Get me Vince Larkin.
{90902}{90960}Two went down,|one came up.
{90962}{91040}- Wasn't my fault.|- Well, you don't have to tell me.
{91042}{91108}Most murders are crimes|of necessity rather than desire.
{91110}{91212}But the great ones,|Dahmer, Gacy, Bundy...
{91214}{91270}- they did it because it excited them.|- Don't you--
{91317}{91368}l got nothing in common|with them, with you.
{91370}{91453}Don't you talk to me!|They were insane.
{91456}{91540}Now you're talking|semantics.
{91542}{91636}What if l told you insane|was working 50 hours a week|in some office for 50 years...
{91638}{91704}at the end of which|they tell you to piss off?
{91706}{91764}Ending up|in some retirement village...
{91766}{91872}hoping to die before suffering|the indignity of trying to make|it to the toilet on time.
{91912}{91966}Wouldn't you consider that|to be insane?
{91968}{92104}Murdering 30 people,|semantics or not, is insane!
{92144}{92188}One girl...
{92190}{92240}l drove through three states|wearing her head as a hat.
{92242}{92313}lt's my daughter's birthday|today.
{92315}{92389}So please feel free|not to share everything with me.
{93853}{93949}All right, you damn peckerwoods,|crack the knuckles and hit the crystals.
{93951}{94007}We're putting this baby|down in a sandbox.
{94223}{94293}Lerner Tower,|do you copy?
{94295}{94369}Lerner Tower,|are you there, Phil?
{94486}{94524}Come on, answer me.
{94526}{94588}l am landing.
{95266}{95315}Oh, my God.
{95317}{95369}Look out!
{97153}{97221}Lerner Airfield.|l'm so glad to be here.
{97298}{97364}Thank you|for choosing Con Air.
{97409}{97509}- Where's the plane, Francisco?|- l don't know. Have patience.
{97511}{97603}The last guy who told me to have|patience? l burned him down,|and bagged his ashes.
{97605}{97653}Cyrus, it'll be here.
{97830}{97919}Hey, you stupid sons of bitches!|Jesus Christ!
{98063}{98124}l hope he likes sand.
{98126}{98205}-Muchacho, run and check out the|tower. Have a look-see, yeah?|-All right.
{98207}{98251}You come with us.
{98357}{98420}- Let's go. We're gettin' off.|- Boss, l can't.|- Yes, you can. Come on!
{98422}{98485}- You shouldn't move him.|- l'm getting him off of this plane.
{98487}{98583}You, you can't move him. He's|too far along. He could go into shock.
{98585}{98640}She's right, Poe.|Go on, man.
{98642}{98699}l'm not leaving|without you, or you.
{98701}{98772}Ah, listen. Here we go.|Ranger boy.
{98774}{98853}- Right.|- Goddamn it, Poe!
{98855}{98917}Man, it's time to fight,|fuck or hit the fence.
{98919}{98978}- l suggest you hit the fence.|- He's right.
{98980}{99037}Just go.
{99039}{99120}All right. Here's how it's gonna play.|l'm gonna get you that needle.
{99122}{99187}Whatever you say, man.|Just do what you gotta do.
{99189}{99227}Fuck.
{99229}{99296}All right, you just hang on.|Don't die on me.
{99309}{99429}Swing low, sweet chariot
{99431}{99503}Comin' for|to carry me home
{99505}{99595}Oh, no. What the hell|you think you're doin'?
{99596}{99663}- lt's time to off the pigs.|- You can't do that.
{99664}{99736}- Tell me why.|- They're hostages. We need 'em.
{99739}{99853}- But why the fuck you care?|- Hey, man, come on.
{99855}{99951}l can't think of a thing|l'd like better...
{99953}{100059}than to put a bullet in the brain base|of every one of these fuckers!
{100061}{100156}But the fact of the matter is,|how well you know this Cindino?
{100159}{100233}l mean, l don't know him that|well myself. Just what l read.
{100236}{100318}Like how he firebombed|that senator's yacht with two|of his own cousins on board.
{100319}{100370}So what's your point?
{100372}{100433}Why would he sweat|about killing some hired guns|once they'd served his purpose?
{100435}{100527}- Now think about that.|- What exactly are we discussing here?
{100529}{100587}Poe don't want me|to off the pigs.
{100589}{100679}Well, it's not difficult to surmise how|Nathan here feels about killing guards.
{100681}{100743}And my own proclivities|are, uh...
{100745}{100875}well-known and, uh,|often-lamented facts of penal lore.
{100876}{100945}What l'm wonderin' is why you have|any opinion about it at all.
{100947}{101015}Cyrus, this is your barbecue,|man, and it tastes good.
{101016}{101121}But l was just sayin' to Mr. Dog over|here, that if it was my barbecue...
{101123}{101215}l'd wait for that old jumbo jet|in the sky before l start|killin' our only leverage.
{101216}{101283}- Shut the fuck up!|- Don't you want to get high|and get laid?
{101284}{101319}- Shit.|- Oh, fuck this!
{101321}{101430}Put the gun down.|Put the gun down, Nathan.
{101432}{101494}Poe's right.|We're goin' to Plan ''B.''
{101496}{101564}Gonna get a refuelling truck|and a tractor.
{101567}{101624}So get back there|and dig the plane out.
{102039}{102147}No. Yes!
{102525}{102636}- Viking, 'bout time to go|and get that tractor, yeah?|- Right.
{102677}{102743}- l'll get the fuel truck.|- Thanks, Poe.
{102745}{102811}You've proven to be|a most useful mammal.
{102813}{102900}''Many hands make light work.''|My daddy taught me that.
{102903}{102963}- You know what my daddy taught me?|- What's that?
{102965}{103062}- Nothin'.|- Self-educated man.
{103123}{103204}-Have you found Vince Larkin?|-We're having trouble reaching him, sir.
{103207}{103272}Of course, you're having trouble|reaching him!
{103275}{103385}He's off saving the rain forest|or recycling his sandals or some shit.
{104201}{104259}Holy shit!
{104413}{104495}Hey! We've got company!
{104496}{104546}Hey!
{104548}{104609}We've got company!
{104641}{104709}Go get Cyrus.
{104711}{104751}Yo, Cyrus!
{104919}{104968}How long we got|till they get here, Nathan?
{104971}{105063}Ten, twelve minutes, tops.
{105263}{105346}Hey, what's your name?|Wanna play?
{105625}{105671}Nice jet.
{105673}{105751}You can take Cindino and leave|the rest to rot for all l care.
{105752}{105848}You fire that weapon, 20 pissed-off|prisoners are gonna hear it.
{105972}{106061}Well, hooray for the sounds|of fuckin' silence.
{106063}{106107}Freeze!
{106571}{106622}- You're Cameron Poe.|- That's right.
{106624}{106691}- l'm Larkin.|- Hello, Larkin.
{106692}{106747}- l got your message.|- Where are the troops?
{106749}{106815}- They'll be here.|- ''They'll be here''?
{106817}{106883}Uh-huh. ln a minute.
{106885}{106975}Listen, Poe,|can l lower this?
{106976}{107050}- Go ahead.|- You gonna lower yours?
{107052}{107127}Sorry, boss, but there's only|two men l trust.
{107129}{107187}One of them's me.|The other's not you.
{107239}{107327}- So Cindino was running|a drag on everyone.|- Yeah.
{107329}{107393}lf you can't trust a South American|drug lord, who can you trust, huh?
{107457}{107553}- That was a joke.|- l'm glad you told me. Now|l gotta get back to the plane.
{107593}{107664}You're a free man, Poe.|What are you doin'?
{107667}{107747}l can't trade a friend's life|for my own, Larkin. That's all.
{107749}{107815}You got a friend on board?
{107816}{107911}See, l knew l was right|about you. l read your file.
{107912}{107997}You're not such a bad guy. Just always|in the wrong place at the wrong time.
{107999}{108051}Good-bye, Larkin.
{108099}{108156}l spoke to your wife.
{108305}{108366}- ln person?|- ln person.
{108391}{108437}And your little girl.
{108488}{108559}You saw Casey?
{108669}{108739}lf this thing goes bad, Larkin,|l'm afraid my daughter...
{108740}{108819}won't understand.
{108820}{108923}lf you talk to my wife again,|you tell her...
{108925}{108971}l love her.
{108997}{109067}She's my hummingbird.
{109069}{109181}But l couldn't leave|a fallen man behind.
{109241}{109315}You'll do that for me,|won't you, Larkin?
{109317}{109417}Sure l will.|What are you gonna do for me?
{109419}{109477}What do you think|l'm gonna do?
{109479}{109527}l'm gonna save|the fuckin' day.

{128840}{128901}All right!
{128904}{128963}Where the skies|are so blue
{128965}{129024}Define irony.
{129026}{129078}Bunch of idiots|dancing on a plane...
{129080}{129203}to a song made famous by a band|that died in a plane crash.
{129377}{129436}ln Birmingham|they love the governor
{129494}{129562}We all did|what we could do

{129990}{130096}Someone alerted the authorities|at Carson City.
{130098}{130169}Someone told them|about our Lerner rendezvous.
{130172}{130245}Someone even killed|poor Billy Bedlam.
{130248}{130367}Now, could this all|be coincidence? Perhaps.
{130369}{130460}Then someone went|and tied a rope to our plane.
{130462}{130569}So l ask you,|what is going on?
{130572}{130688}And l answer.|We have a traitor in our midst.
{130690}{130787}Now, how do we flush|a traitor?
{130789}{130857}l don't know,|but at the count of three...
{130860}{130918}l will find out who is|on my team and who is not.

{132745}{132840}- l'm feeling like maybe|l'm not supposed to make it.|- You're gonna make it.
{132890}{132952}Cyrus Grissom, this is|Special Agent Vince Larkin.
{132954}{133060}We will shoot the plane down|if you do not respond now.
{133104}{133203}All l can think about is like,|there ain't no God.
{133205}{133272}That He don't exist.
{133328}{133449}- Hey, where you goin'?|- l'm gonna show you God does exist!
{133577}{133620}Fire!
{133622}{133699}Malloy, you son of a bitch!|Cease fire!
