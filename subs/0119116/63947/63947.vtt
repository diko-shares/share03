1
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,130
Danny, give me my shirt!

2
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,174
Come and get it.

3
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:24,458
Don't you think that maybe we're taking
this hazing thing a little bit too far?

4
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,043
I absolutely do not.

5
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,545
Hey!

6
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,173
Cassidy!

7
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,527
- Hey, give me a beer. Come on, man.
- Get your own, pretty boy.

8
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,195
- Don't be a dick.
- Get your own.

9
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:56,532
Hey, move it, douche bag. Get out of here.

10
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,368
Mmm. Sudsy!

11
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,705
Hey, Chugs! Give me a beer! And a BJ.

12
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,347
Hey, what the fuck?

13
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,217
Hey, no! You both, out! Now!

14
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,554
Some massive titties!

15
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,314
How long have you been a Theta?

16
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,149
- Do you want one?
- No, thanks.

17
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,738
- Hey, Ellie, up here.
- I got to go. Sorry.

18
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,948
It wasn't that hard a question.

19
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,497
Asshole!

20
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,006
- Where are we going, Claire?
- Hurry up. Jessica's waiting.

21
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:41,136
Goodbye, virginity! Yeah! Theta Pi rules!

22
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:45,515
I think I'm gonna be sick. Look out below!

23
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,853
Heather, get a room.

24
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:55,567
Hey, boys. Out, out, out!

25
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,820
- I just got tested. It's cool.
- Okay.

26
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,616
Cassidy, my room, Theta toast, now.

27
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,410
- Have you seen Andy?
- Hos before bros.

28
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,996
Uh, Claire, line up those shots!

29
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,707
None of that Jell-O crap.
Mama needs to get her buzz on.

30
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,000
Thetas!

31
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,294
This party kicks off our senior year.

32
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:19,675
But first, shout outs. Claire,
I like being your friend, because

33
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:23,345
it makes me multi-cultural
without having to do anything.

34
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,724
- That's so racist.
- Okay. Okay.

35
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,270
Chugs, I love you, because
you're always willing to try anything new

36
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,563
and you don't give a damn
what anyone thinks.

37
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,024
Is this a bad time to tell you
I boned your dad?

38
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,986
Gross.

39
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,029
It was after the divorce.

40
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:46,201
Ellie, I love you because you are
always there to help with homework.

41
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,078
You're like a spell check with a nice rack.

42
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,209
Okay, Cass, I love you
because you're so real.

43
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,586
That's just because
she can't afford fake ones.

44
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:01,425
I love you, Jessica,
because you make being a bitch an art form.

45
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,552
Hear, hear!

46
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:07,848
Theta Pi, we honor thee!
From life to death, sorority!

47
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,313
Wait, wait, wait, where's Megan?
She should be here for this.

48
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,565
Oh, I forgot.

49
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:20,277
Let me show you something
that is sure to be a YouTube classic.

50
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,031
Gather round, ladies.
Chugs, grab the laptop.

51
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,490
What are you guys up to?

52
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,786
Baby, I love you so much.
- Oh, my God.

53
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,246
Is that Garret?

54
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,582
I thought Megan dumped him
after he cheated on her.

55
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:36,668
Well, apparently, she took him back.

56
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,254
- What can I say? My brother's good in bed.
- Chugs.

57
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,089
- That's so gross.
You guys are sick.

58
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,008
Did Megan get a little work done
over the summer?

59
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,594
What? You thought she gained
four bra sizes in three months?

60
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,305
God, is this all he's got?

61
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,724
Yeah, what is this?
The Dry Hump Olympics?

62
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,105
Come on, guys, this is gross.
Oh, my God.

63
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:58,648
Why isn't she moving?

64
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,901
We gave Garret a little something
to put into her drink.

65
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,277
Told him it'd help put her in the mood.

66
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,529
You let your brother give her roofies?

67
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,114
Come on, roofie sex isn't that bad.

68
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,949
You get laid
and you get a good night's sleep.

69
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,786
- It's true.
Chugs.

70
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,747
Finally, we're getting somewhere.

71
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:19,294
- Ooh! Looks like he's kissing a corpse.
Exactly. This is the best prank ever.

72
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,471
Oh, my God.

73
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,556
- Oh, my God. Megan. Jesus Christ.
Guys, what the hell?

74
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,183
Baby?
Holy shit, you guys.

75
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:36,186
- We got to do something.
- Baby, are you okay? Jesus Christ.

76
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,729
Jesus!
Let's go!

77
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,106
My God.

78
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,818
You guys...

79
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,153
She's convulsing and there's
shit coming out of her mouth.

80
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,571
- What?
- Yeah, I don't...

81
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,989
What the fuck did you do?

82
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,658
I didn't do...
I slipped her the pills you gave me.

83
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,159
I said give her one!

84
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,244
- I didn't know!
- Guys!

85
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,079
- She's not breathing.
We have to clear her airway.

86
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,163
Why doesn't somebody call an ambulance?

87
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,498
There's no time. Here.

88
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,625
Give me the keys. Get me the Escalade now!

89
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,252
- I'm going.
- Claire! Hey!

90
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,711
Yep. I'm on it.

91
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,052
That is so hot.

92
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,178
Chugs!

93
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,975
What? No tongue?

94
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,686
Easy there, Lezzie Lohan.
This is make-believe, remember?

95
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,771
- What is going on?
- She's okay?

96
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:23,692
No, I'm not okay. I have fake puke
all over my $800 silk sheets.

97
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:24,943
What exactly is happening?

98
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,903
- Garret cheated on me.
- Didn't you cheat on him first?

99
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:30,407
Details! That little bitch boy
cheated on a Theta.

100
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,826
You cheat on one Theta,
you cheat on every Theta.

101
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,496
Also he says, "I love you,"
like, 15 times every time we do it.

102
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,165
But Garret is Chugs' brother.

103
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:41,418
My brother, who slipped my Theta sister
pills he thought were roofies.

104
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,712
My brother who also rushed Tri Pi.

105
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,964
Whose motto is, "We'll try any pie. "

106
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,799
That boy needs to be taught a lesson.

107
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,718
So if they weren't roofies,
then what were they?

108
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,886
Vitamin B-12.

109
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,471
You know that helps prevent anemia?

110
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:56,141
Too bad it doesn't prevent bulimia.
That's something Megan could actually use.

111
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,646
Show time.

112
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,071
I can't even tell if she's breathing or not.

113
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,281
I think she's turning cold.

114
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,408
Don't say that to me!
Don't tell me that!

115
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,826
How far are we from the hospital?

116
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,370
I don't know. I think I took a wrong turn.
I'm totally freaking out.

117
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,414
- What!
- She's not gonna make it!

118
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,500
Oh, my God, she's dead.
She really fucking died.

119
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,835
She died and it's my fault.
I'm gonna go to fucking jail!

120
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,672
Hey! Watch my car!

121
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,425
Okay, you know what?
Everybody calm down. Garret, this is all...

122
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,511
Oh, my God! She's really dead!

123
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:36,097
I need help. I need help.
Chugs, I want to call Mom right now.

124
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,526
Where are we going?

125
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,653
Garret, we're gonna take care of this. Okay?

126
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,239
- I'm gonna call for help.
- No, no, no!

127
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,448
Hey, we all had...

128
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,701
I'm calling the fucking cops.
You guys had nothing to do with this.

129
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,912
Really? Who gave you the roofies?
Jessica did.

130
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,914
And she died at a party
at our sorority house.

131
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,999
They'll close down our chapter for sure.

132
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:06,628
- Right, Ellie?
- Yeah. Any illicit drugs use on campus

133
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,463
is an automatic
two-year chapter suspension.

134
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,882
I don't care about that! She's dying!

135
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,264
There's no signal.
Garret, look at me.

136
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:20,976
Look at me. Look at me, all right?
Hey, you've got to look at me.

137
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,145
- We can make all this go away.
How?

138
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,731
Trust me. I know a place.

139
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:28,984
Okay. All right.

140
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,279
Okay.

141
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,240
Claire, turn up here.

142
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,693
Get on the ground. Shh.

143
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,696
Garret, there's a blanket in the back. Get it.

144
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,951
I guess I'll get it.

145
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,218
What's happening? I can't see.

146
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,137
Shh. You're dead, dummy.

147
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,140
So the only thing to settle on is the body.

148
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:46,353
Do we wrap it in the blanket as it is,
or do we chop it into little pieces first?

149
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:50,523
Okay. Let's try not to leave our DNA
all over the place. Thank you.

150
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,234
So, what's it gonna be?

151
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,570
One big chunk or little bits and pieces?

152
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,698
In premed, we learned that if there's air
in the lungs or the chest cavity

153
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,158
the body will float to the surface.

154
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:03,036
Yeah, she's right. We can't have her body
floating to the top.

155
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,371
Yeah. Somebody will find her.

156
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,831
What about those implants?
Does silicone float?

157
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,463
All right. Everybody spread out and find
sharp rocks to dismember the body with.

158
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,739
So how long
are you gonna keep this going?

159
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,617
Yeah, I mean I kind of agree
with Cass.

160
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,452
This is funny and all, but...

161
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,623
You're right. That's why we're doing it.

162
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,792
Because it's funny.

163
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,757
Oh, my God!

164
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,427
There's no air in her lungs now.
What the hell did you do?

165
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:03,972
There's no air in her lungs now.
There's no air in her lungs now.

166
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,809
- Oh, my God, what did you do?
- You mean, she wasn't dead?

167
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,186
Shut the fuck up!

168
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,397
Ellie! Ellie! Help me stop the bleeding.

169
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,482
Start on her.

170
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,985
Oh, my God, Megan!

171
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,948
Oh, my God!

172
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,997
Somebody call 911.

173
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,169
God!

174
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,340
I don't have any reception!

175
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,092
Anyone?

176
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,136
We can't move her!

177
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,390
Come on, Megan!

178
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:09,162
Somebody get in the car
and drive until you get a signal.

179
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,830
Wait, no. Wait, you guys.

180
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:12,999
She's dead.

181
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,418
- No, no, no.
- Cassidy, look at her. She's dead.

182
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,337
She couldn't be more dead.

183
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,055
What are we gonna do?

184
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,562
We need to talk about this for a minute.

185
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,731
Do you want to put her
in the car and go back?

186
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,233
We could.

187
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:42,695
Maybe. But we all need to be prepared
with what comes with that.

188
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,030
What does that mean?

189
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:47,492
Well, maybe we should call
our parents first.

190
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,160
I mean, Megan's dead.

191
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:54,666
And we're all responsible,
so we're gonna need lawyers.

192
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,834
But Garret did it.

193
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,170
Yes, and Garret will be going to jail,
but we are all just as responsible.

194
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,590
Garret? I am not letting my little brother go
to jail for a stupid prank! No way!

195
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,592
What, do you want to leave Megan
out here?

196
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,677
Why not?

197
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,470
I mean, everything we said a minute ago
is still true.

198
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,097
Nobody knows we're here except us.

199
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:12,100
That's true.
- Oh, my God, you can't be serious.

200
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,602
- She's our sister.
That's also true.

201
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:19,023
Megan was our sister. And we loved her.

202
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:22,485
But I also know that Megan loved us.

203
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,779
And Theta Pi.

204
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,907
Would she want us to go down like this?

205
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,953
Throw away our lives
and destroy the people we love?

206
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,291
Yes, Claire. Didn't your dad have
a heart attack last year?

207
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,418
Enough, Jessica.
I know what you're trying to do.

208
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,961
What am I trying to do?

209
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:43,006
I'm trying to make the best
out of a tragic situation.

210
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,799
You're the one who suggested
we just leave her out here.

211
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,510
No, I did not, and you know that!
There's right and there's wrong.

212
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,804
I agree. But it's also wrong

213
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:54,017
to destroy the lives of our families
for mistakes that we have made.

214
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:57,103
All I can see is my father's face
when he hears all this.

215
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,855
It'll kill him.

216
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,190
Jessica doesn't care about
your father, Claire.

217
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,651
The only thing she cares about is herself.

218
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:07,280
Think about it. If this gets out,
Kyle's daddy won't let him be with her,

219
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,157
because a killer in the family
doesn't look very good

220
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,825
when you're running for Senate.

221
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,827
What about your Mr. Perfect?

222
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,412
You really think
Andy's gonna stay with you after this?

223
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,331
This has nothing to do with him.

224
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:19,334
This decision affects the rest of our lives!

225
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,503
All right? Every job.
Every relationship we ever have.

226
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,130
People will know.

227
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,842
Shit! What the fuck
did you guys make me do, man?

228
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,344
This is fucked!

229
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,640
Maybe we should vote on it.

230
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:38,102
What? I cannot believe my ears. What
happened to the tenets of sisterhood?

231
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,188
Trust, honor, respect.

232
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,231
Well, you forgot two.

233
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,526
Secrecy and solidarity.

234
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,530
There is a dead person here.
A girl that we murdered.

235
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,907
Accidentally!

236
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,283
Listen to yourself. All of you.

237
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,578
This is not something you just sweep
under the rug or choose to forget.

238
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,288
You have to live with this forever!

239
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,165
I completely agree, Cassidy.

240
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:05,254
I'm just trying to figure out
how we're going to live with it.

241
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,596
I can't help but think

242
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,766
what I would want if I were lying
where Megan is now.

243
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,228
I could tell you what I wouldn't want.

244
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,564
I wouldn't want you guys
to throw away your lives

245
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,901
over something that cannot be changed.

246
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:32,281
Because that's how much I love
each and every one of you.

247
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,371
Shall we vote?

248
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,499
Vote all you want.
Ellie and I know the truth. Right, Ellie?

249
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,211
Ellie?

250
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:52,885
Look, Cass. Everything you said was right.

251
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:58,599
You're stronger than me, okay?
And you guys aren't on scholarship.

252
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,102
I don't see a way out of this.

253
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,979
There is no way out of this.

254
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:06,441
Well, maybe there is.

255
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,448
Oh, my God,
have you lost your fucking mind?

256
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,245
I'm gonna make this very easy on all of you.

257
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,877
Forget her. You guys, the last time
we saw Megan was at the party.

258
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:29,547
She disappeared.
And we never saw her again.

259
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,549
Okay?

260
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,635
If we all stick to the same story,
no one will ever know, right?

261
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,846
You guys can say
whatever the hell you want to say.

262
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,930
No.

263
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,476
You're gonna say
what we tell you to say. Okay?

264
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,228
Are you gonna kill me, too?

265
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,983
Cass, we can't let you do that.

266
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,359
No. Let her go. It doesn't matter.

267
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,820
She's gonna have to walk for three miles
before she gets any reception.

268
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,989
But now, later, if she tells the cops,
goodbye, life.

269
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,700
Come on, you guys. We have no choice.

270
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,661
Come on, help me lift her.

271
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,627
Come on. Come on.

272
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,577
Ready?

273
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,752
- Ready? One, two...
- Wait!

274
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,925
What if this is a mistake?
I mean, if we cross this line...

275
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,553
Look at the hole in her chest, Ellie.
The line's already been crossed.

276
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,720
Three.

277
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,437
You guys, I still can't get a signal.

278
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,318
Where is she?

279
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,240
Don't worry. At least she'll be warm, Cass.

280
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,617
We wrapped her up
in your bloody jacket first.

281
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,744
Oh, my God.

282
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:32,253
And we all agreed.
We won't tell anyone what you did.

283
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,215
- What I did?
- How you killed Megan with the tire iron.

284
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,719
We're sisters. We'll protect you.

285
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,679
You can count on us.

286
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:46,559
Trust, respect, honor,
secrecy and solidarity.

287
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,520
You wouldn't.

288
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:53,608
We did. We're not gonna let this
ruin our lives, Cassidy.

289
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,902
And there's no reason you have to, either.

290
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,946
You guys, it is not that simple.
You can't do this, okay?

291
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,990
Do you know what it's like
to live with a secret like this?

292
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,450
Of course we do.

293
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,951
We're Theta Pi.

294
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:08,623
Now let's go wash the blood off in the lake.
And get back to the party.

295
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,806
We knew you'd come around, Cass.

296
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,602
Thank you, Cassidy.

297
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,146
Come on.

298
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,257
As I stand
here with you today,

299
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,676
I'm reminded of one of my favorite quotes.

300
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:04,679
"Reputation comes
from the company you keep. "

301
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:09,684
Well, thanks to you all,
the company I've kept these past four years

302
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:14,188
has provided me with a reputation
I will always be proud of.

303
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,190
Congratulations, graduates.

304
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,025
Good luck. And God bless.

305
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:29,370
To my sisters at Theta Pi,
not just for four years, but forever.

306
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:33,207
Congrats, ladies.
Ellie, you drink like a girl.

307
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,960
Ooh. That went up my nose.

308
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,795
Here, Jess. Have a sip.

309
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,714
Cheers!
Cheers!

310
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,221
I'm gonna miss you guys.

311
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,349
This is gonna be awful.

312
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,184
So, let's skip it.

313
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,437
We don't have to go to
some stupid luncheon.

314
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:57,565
My mother is a legacy.
She wants to see the house.

315
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,401
Think about the good side.
You live through tonight,

316
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:03,112
then tomorrow, we drive down
to my parents' place

317
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,364
and wake up to waves crashing
on the beach.

318
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,742
Yeah, well, if I thought
we'd be waking up in the same bed,

319
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:10,870
- maybe it would give me a thrill.
- My parents still think it's the '50s.

320
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:14,957
Mmm-hmm. Did I mention that I know
some great hotels in the area?

321
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,672
Hey, what happened to you
and your sisters, anyway?

322
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,759
You were all so close,
then after Megan disappeared...

323
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,385
Could we not talk about that?

324
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,430
I keep hoping you'll change your mind.

325
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,640
Can we please just talk about
something else?

326
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,226
I just want you to know I'm here for you.

327
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,370
I think you put this on wrong.

328
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,460
And you definitely put this on wrong.

329
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,966
Let me guess. I put these on wrong, too.

330
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,326
I'm so excited.

331
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,329
- It's so pretty.
- Wow. Look at this place.

332
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,997
You'd almost think nice people lived here.

333
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,249
Hey, be nice.

334
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,171
And there's the devil herself.

335
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:49,176
Mr. and Mrs. Tappan!
I haven't seen you in forever.

336
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,803
Hi, Jessica.

337
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:54,682
Well, well, well, if it isn't the boy
who has taken our little Cassidy away.

338
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,725
She's a big girl.
She can make her own decisions.

339
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:00,855
Careful. Don't you know? Earth and fire
can't break the bonds of Theta Pi.

340
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,857
After all, we're sisters.

341
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,317
Excuse me.

342
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,778
So, where is everyone? Chugs?

343
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,363
Chugs...

344
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,073
Well, you know Chugs.

345
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:14,743
She's always willing to help out
with a little freshman orientation.

346
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,292
You taste like vomit.

347
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,712
That's because I threw up before.
But I ate a mint, so you're fine.

348
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,717
Oops! I forgot to wear underwear.

349
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,430
And it's really cold down there.

350
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,059
Maybe you could warm it up for me?

351
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,897
This whole thing's kind of grossing me out.

352
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:48,319
Whatever. Move it, loser.
Not my fault you're gay.

353
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:55,534
This has been the best four years
of our lives.

354
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,787
The best five years for some of us.
Not mentioning any names.

355
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,080
Becky Reed.

356
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,959
We have this luncheon every year

357
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,962
to celebrate the long-lasting ties
of sisterhood.

358
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:10,090
And to remember that our motto,

359
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:16,055
"Trust, respect, honor,
secrecy and solidarity,"

360
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,349
are truly words that last a lifetime.

361
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:21,227
As you can see by looking
at the east wing of the house,

362
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,270
renovations are getting underway.

363
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:27,441
So the house, like our sisterhood,
will be stronger than ever.

364
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,277
We have our beloved housemother to thank

365
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,946
for all of her hard work
on getting this done.

366
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,572
Thank you, Mrs. Crenshaw.

367
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,865
Thank you.

368
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:51,131
However, as happy as this day is,
there's still one whom we cannot forget.

369
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,385
One of our sisters is still missing.

370
00:25:55,428 --> 00:26:00,266
And we hope and pray
that she will come back to us.

371
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,270
To Megan.

372
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,356
No frigging way.

373
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,150
We love and miss you always.

374
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,494
Well, as you can see, some of us
are still a little overwhelmed by it all.

375
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,254
Okay, who up and faints anymore?

376
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:31,589
It's okay. I told them it was the heat.

377
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,508
- It was Megan. I know it was her.
- It was her sister, dumbass.

378
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,719
And might I say, you played it real cool.

379
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:42,558
Hi. I'm so sorry.
I did not mean to scare you, Ellie.

380
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:43,892
How'd she know my name?

381
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:48,272
I'm Maggie. I met you before.
All of you. When I was 15.

382
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:51,525
Right. You're bigger. You've grown up.

383
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,363
I decided I'm coming to Rosman next year.

384
00:26:57,032 --> 00:27:00,075
I think it's important for my sister.
You know, some closure.

385
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,287
And I think it'd be good
for my parents, too, so...

386
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,955
So, how are they doing?

387
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,166
Okay. They couldn't come today.

388
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,710
It's still way too hard.

389
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,046
But I didn't want to miss it.

390
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,674
Anyways, I just wanted to come by
and say hello

391
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:19,178
and let you guys know that I'm gonna be
rushing Theta Pi next year.

392
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,804
I'm gonna be sick.

393
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,850
We'd be lucky to have you.

394
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:29,605
Um, you guys having a party tonight?

395
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:33,192
Yeah. Yeah. You know,
you should totally come.

396
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:37,196
Wait, no, you're rushing next year
and that violates Greek rules of recruiting.

397
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,907
Well, I won't tell if you guys won't.

398
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:44,078
Well, we have to go.
Sorry about tonight, but I'll tell you what,

399
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,081
I will personally see to your future
as a Theta Pi next year.

400
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,041
- Okay.
- Okay.

401
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,709
- Nice to meet you guys.
- You, too.

402
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,961
Friend me on Facebook, I'll totally confirm.

403
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,255
- Bye.
Bye.

404
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:00,803
Was it just me,
or was that girl all sorts of creepy.

405
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:01,970
Can't imagine why.

406
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,806
No way she's getting in with that outfit.

407
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,141
Who is ready to party?

408
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,143
That would be me.
That would be me.

409
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,105
That's what I was looking for.

410
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,272
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

411
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,358
- Hi, you.
- Hi.

412
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,527
Chugs, your mom? Smoking.

413
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,278
I would definitely have
a sip of that MILF-shake.

414
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,490
- Hey!
- If I wasn't dating you, of course, Claire.

415
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:24,451
Okay, we have two hours
before this place is packed.

416
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,453
I got to get to my shrink. Score some Oxys.

417
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,373
Hey, you think if you blow him,
you can get enough for everyone?

418
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,125
- Kyle, excuse me.
- What? I'm serious.

419
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:34,795
I wish it were that painless. Unfortunately
for me, he's more of an ass man.

420
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:39,258
Okay, you guys, it's on.
Tonight we bring the house down.

421
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,342
That we do.

422
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,636
Kyle, can you and Mickey
go get some decorations from the cellar?

423
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,555
- Yeah. Let's do it.
- Yeah, we can do that.

424
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:45,973
- Thanks. Bye.
- Bye.

425
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,350
You are so whipped.
Speak for yourself, pretty boy.

426
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,978
It's Ellie's.

427
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,197
What? Oh, my God.

428
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,491
Who sent this?
What the hell?

429
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,535
- Oh, my God.
- Is this a joke?

430
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,245
Garret! I'm gonna kill him.

431
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:10,497
Garret? What the fuck is this, Chugs?

432
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,291
It's a joke. It's a really bad joke.

433
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,667
This is beyond sick.

434
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,169
Okay. Why would Garret do this?

435
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:18,422
I can think of a reason. He's gone psycho
and he wants to kill us all.

436
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:19,840
Hey, he's not...

437
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:25,095
Guys! Look, I know my brother.
Okay, yes, he's sort of

438
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:30,017
lost his way, but I know him, okay? And...

439
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,479
Look, he developed
this weird sense of humor

440
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,441
since the accident,
and this is just his way of saying...

441
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:40,152
Oh, happy graduation? That's real funny.

442
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,361
What the hell are we gonna do?

443
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:44,072
Nothing. That's why delete was invented.

444
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,991
Hey, guys.
- Delete it, Claire.

445
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:51,246
So, now all we have to do
is get rid of Crenshaw

446
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,123
and get this place ready for the party.

447
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:57,377
Ellie, can you be in charge
with freshman cleaning up the place?

448
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,046
If Cassidy helps me.

449
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,839
I'm not...

450
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,967
Please don't say you're not coming.
How is that gonna look?

451
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,052
I don't care how it looks.

452
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,554
To be honest, Jessica,
I don't really care if we get caught.

453
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,681
I just don't want to share a cell with you.

454
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,142
Don't act all holier than thou.

455
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,603
You could have gone to the cops
if you really wanted to.

456
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,707
- Hey.
- What you doing?

457
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,251
Careful what you say, I just pinned you.

458
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,795
Hey, I'm just updating my Facebook.
I just wrote,

459
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:42,756
"Andy has just graduated
and can't wait to take his girl fishing. "

460
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,133
I told you, I'll go to your parents,

461
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:48,262
if you and your dad catch the fish,
your mom cooks the fish and I eat the fish.

462
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,597
- It's not that complicated.
- Lazy! God!

463
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,432
- Hey.
- To think, I was gonna ask

464
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,018
if you wanted to come to Europe with me
this summer.

465
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,229
Look, Andy,

466
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,149
there's some things
you really don't know about me.

467
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,777
Hey, if it's the morning breath,
trust me, I know.

468
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,612
No, I'm being serious.

469
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,198
I'll tell you everything tonight
on the way to your parents.

470
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,534
And I just have one more favor.

471
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,828
I've kind of been sucked
into this thing at Theta.

472
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:14,496
Would you mind coming with me
to the house

473
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,540
just for the beginning of the party,
and then we can leave?

474
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,210
- Yeah. Anything for you.
- You're the best.

475
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:24,131
Really. You're the most wonderful thing
in my life.

476
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:27,968
And I'd do anything for you.

477
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,846
Really? Well, we'll test that theory tonight.

478
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,808
- Okay, I'll see you in an hour.
- Cool. Bye.

479
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,902
Okay, ladies,
I know the rules.

480
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:49,448
You get the house to yourself
the last night you spend in Theta Pi.

481
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,992
And I trust that you will show this place

482
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:56,330
the same respect
that you've shown me the past four years.

483
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,041
- Of course.
- That was a joke.

484
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:03,003
Now I know that during your time here,

485
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,547
I was forced to give most of you
a write-up or two.

486
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:09,176
But trust me, for every boy
that I threw out of here,

487
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:13,013
there were five times I knew about it
and didn't say one thing.

488
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:17,476
And sometimes there were five boys
in one night. Right, Chugs?

489
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,354
I have a lot of areas that need attention.
I don't know.

490
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,438
Slut!
What are you looking at?

491
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:25,317
Anyway, I hope, as you girls prepare
to go out into the world,

492
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,820
that the things that you've learned
here in Theta Pi

493
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:32,866
will always help to guide you
to do the right thing.

494
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:36,203
And now, to make sure
you don't forget me or each other,

495
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,663
a little gift.

496
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,250
I'm sorry. It's really nice.

497
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:47,381
There are 22 links in each chain.

498
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,509
One for every graduating Theta Pi senior.

499
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:53,387
When you wear these bracelets,
you will always remember

500
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:56,390
just how strong the bonds
of sisterhood are.

501
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,059
Thank you.
- Please!

502
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,687
Okay, I'm out of here.

503
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,731
- You girls behave yourselves.
- We will.

504
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:07,317
Well, screw it. That'll never happen.

505
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:11,571
Just make sure you don't hurt yourselves
or the house. All right?

506
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,115
- No problem, Mrs. Crenshaw.
- All right.

507
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,741
- Thank you, Mrs. Crenshaw.
- Bye, girls!

508
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,535
Bye.
- Bye-bye.

509
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:20,914
What is this? Silver-coated?
I'm never gonna wear this.

510
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,583
Excuse me. Move, bitches.

511
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,252
Jess, wait up. Give me a hug.

512
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,505
- Bye, Mrs. Crenshaw.
- Bye.

513
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:49,651
Seconds to your elevator
from the station

514
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:53,655
How can I resist that kind of invitation?

515
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:57,117
Come on, chicken.
One last time in the hot tub?

516
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:02,289
You're crazy, there's people all around.
I say we just head upstairs, huh?

517
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,292
What have you got there, Claire?

518
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,627
I don't think the bubble bath
will be good for the jets.

519
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,634
No, not the boobies.

520
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,137
So...

521
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,223
Okay.

522
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,642
I'm gonna do it.

523
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,162
Dr. Rosenberg?

524
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,418
Anybody home?

525
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,636
Hello?

526
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,031
Dr. Rosenberg?

527
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,748
Hello?

528
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,544
Dr. Rosenberg?

529
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,467
Doc? I'm here for my 5:00.

530
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,608
Dr. Rosenberg!

531
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:59,656
Hi. Sorry about this.
The last session ended abruptly.

532
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,199
Where are the keys?

533
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,119
They're on the... Hey.

534
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:08,790
There's no reason you and I can't finish
what my last patient started.

535
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:13,378
Have I mentioned
all the sample prescriptions I have

536
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,921
with no place to go?

537
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:20,719
Okay. I'm gonna go freshen up.

538
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:45,410
Excuse me.
You have to schedule an appointment.

539
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,308
Hey, Jess, it's me. Look,

540
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,061
I'm not gonna make it back
until after the party starts

541
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:14,898
'cause Dr. Rosenberg's really making me
earn the pills this time.

542
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,067
But I'll see you later? Bye.

543
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,218
Cheers, slut.

544
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,646
Really?

545
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,069
Hello?

546
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:11,121
I don't have time for "Catch Me, Rape Me. "

547
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:53,496
Theta Pi, bitches!

548
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,417
Guys, it's 6:00 and I'm already wasted.

549
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,753
Yeah, and by 10:00, she'll be pregnant.

550
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:15,769
Okay.

551
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,444
Senator Tyson.

552
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,614
It is so nice to see you.

553
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,033
I apologize. I wasn't able
to make your luncheon.

554
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:32,452
I just flew in
from a Commerce Committee meeting.

555
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,953
That's no problem.

556
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,503
- Where's Kyle?
- He'll be along.

557
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:45,715
This is nice for us. Gives us a chance
to talk. Sort out a few things.

558
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,258
Thank you.

559
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,471
Jessica, may I be frank?

560
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:55,141
You are a spirited girl.

561
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,018
Oh, thank you, sir.

562
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,437
I didn't mean that as a compliment.

563
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,272
As I'm sure you've heard,

564
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:04,651
there are rumblings I might get
a vice presidential nod.

565
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,194
Yes, sir.

566
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:10,198
In my experience,
there are two kinds of girls in this world.

567
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:14,452
The ones you spend your life with
and the ones you burn hard with.

568
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,997
Problem is that I'm not sure
what kind you are.

569
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,167
But I am sure that Kyle wants
to spend his life with you.

570
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:27,048
Sir, I've been dreaming my whole life
to marry someone like Kyle.

571
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,758
I don't like surprises.

572
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:31,344
Okay.

573
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,806
When I pick up a book,
the first thing I do is read the last page.

574
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:40,186
I'll be watching you, Jessica.
Don't give me any surprises.

575
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:43,356
Otherwise this dream
you've had your whole life, well,

576
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,483
it all goes away.

577
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:50,655
Senator Tyson, I won't disappoint you.

578
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,200
I know you won't. I know you won't.

579
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,035
I'm sorry.

580
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,832
I am so sorry.
I was riding my bike and I got a flat.

581
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,375
Yeah. Well, nothing to worry about, son.

582
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:05,628
Your charming young lady
and I were just catching up.

583
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,339
She is a charmer, isn't she?

584
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,604
Looks like someone's been hard at work.

585
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:25,523
- Hey.
- Yeah.

586
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,900
Could you put your eyes back in your head?

587
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,735
At least until I leave the room?
Sure can.

588
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:29,903
Thanks.

589
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,865
Seriously, dude, the party starts in an hour.

590
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,325
Go get ready!
I'm going!

591
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,785
Okay. Good. Bye.

592
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:39,913
Are you gonna be all right?

593
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,581
Sure. Why wouldn't I be all right?

594
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:45,877
I'm good, Cass. Just let me help clean up.
That goes in the basement. I'll take it down.

595
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,176
That's tacky.

596
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,262
- I'm worried about her.
- Who?

597
00:41:56,597 --> 00:42:00,266
Ellie. What is gonna happen to her
when she leaves this place?

598
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,434
What do I care?

599
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,603
I don't need her to do my term papers
for me anymore.

600
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:07,273
Jessica, I think that we have different
definitions of the word "sister. "

601
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,236
I'm gonna go take a shower.
That's not an invitation.

602
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,631
Wow. Yoga is working wonders
on your ass.

603
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:20,221
Sorry. Didn't know this was ocupado.

604
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,474
FYI, waxing isn't just for floors anymore.

605
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,312
Riley?

606
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:28,980
Are you a senior?

607
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,357
Because last time I checked,
this was a senior bathroom.

608
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,860
Do I have to start checking stalls again?

609
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,028
Fuck.

610
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,030
No, I didn't think so.

611
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,115
You can leave now.

612
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,535
Actually. Wait. Drop your towel first.

613
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:45,371
My room's on the other side of the...

614
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,540
Without rules, there would be chaos.

615
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:52,545
Fine. But if you wanted to see perfect tits,
all you had to do was ask.

616
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,218
What?

617
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,225
I keep thinking about that text.

618
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,894
Claire...

619
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:13,191
Garret is a little bitch.
He says we made him kill Megan?

620
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:14,525
As if.

621
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:16,569
Seriously, Claire, grow a pair.

622
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,364
Jessica, I've always had your back.

623
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:21,449
But you've never had a backbone.

624
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:57,068
Hello?

625
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,594
Hello?

626
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,520
Hey, Ellie,
see if there's more vodka down there.

627
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:15,730
Okay.

628
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,086
Okay, more vodka.

629
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,174
Hello?

630
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,763
Anybody there?

631
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:54,268
Where the hell
would they keep more vodka?

632
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,489
No. No.

633
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:10,076
Damn it! Shit.

634
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:14,747
Oh, this is really dumb.

635
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:22,839
"Here lies Ellie Morris,
and she never got laid. "

636
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:57,206
Ellie. Whoa.

637
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,417
You all right?

638
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,921
What are you...
What are you doing down here?

639
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,590
I'm looking for you.

640
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:08,926
Cassidy said you might need some help.

641
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:16,601
We killed her, you guys.
Don't you understand that?

642
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,811
We dumped her body down a mineshaft!

643
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,062
- Why can't you understand that?
- Hey, Ellie,

644
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,898
there are 30 other girls behind that door

645
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:24,483
that probably shouldn't know
we murdered our sorority sister, okay?

646
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,027
This isn't happening. It's not possible.

647
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,321
Okay, seriously, everyone just relax

648
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:31,324
- for two seconds.
- Relax? The last time I saw that jacket,

649
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,951
you wrapped it around a dead body
and dropped it down a mineshaft.

650
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,828
- Where's the rest of it?
It's a prank.

651
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:38,706
It's the only explanation. It's...
Somebody's playing a prank.

652
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:41,667
Yeah, or maybe Megan came back
from the dead and she wants to kill us.

653
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,002
- How about that?
No, listen.

654
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:45,463
Ellie, we didn't want to tell you,
but we got a text message earlier

655
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:48,132
and we think that this is Garret
playing a sick joke on us.

656
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,051
- Garret?
Yes.

657
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:51,385
He came back?

658
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:55,306
He's gone psycho. He's left the compound.
Where the hell is Chugs, anyway?

659
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,183
She left me a message.
She'll be here when the party starts.

660
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:01,020
The party's already started!
I'm sorry, but it has.

661
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,564
We all deserve to die.

662
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,399
Hi, it's Chugs. Leave a message after the...

663
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,945
Chugs, we need to know where
your brother is and we need to know now.

664
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:11,739
Please, call back whenever you get this.

665
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:16,994
- We're dead. We're so dead.
- Nobody is dead, Ellie.

666
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,371
Well, Megan.

667
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:21,832
This is Garret. Garret is harmless.
That's not the problem.

668
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:25,670
- Then what is the problem?
- Well, Garret's gone nuts!

669
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:29,423
Guys, if he blabs,
that's orange jumpsuits for all of us.

670
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:30,549
What do we do?

671
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:32,510
- We're calling the police.
No.

672
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:35,054
We stick together. Above all else.

673
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:37,807
Why is it that the only time
you want to stick together

674
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:40,393
- is when your ass is on the line?
- And we wait for Chugs

675
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,311
to put a pin in her brother.

676
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:46,732
But for now,
let's get ready and go downstairs

677
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,943
- and enjoy the party.
Like that's gonna happen.

678
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:50,444
If we do not go to our own party,

679
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:53,823
we might as well magic-marker "guilty"
across our foreheads.

680
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:56,909
And if anybody sees Garret,
come get me, I will deal with him.

681
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,662
But what about the jacket?

682
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,247
Hide it, Ellie.

683
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,496
Help yourself.

684
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:46,375
Yeah, I can see this ending well.

685
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,392
Boo!

686
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:53,651
Oh, my God, I so want to be anywhere
but here right now.

687
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:57,154
- You're not alone.
- I promise we'll leave soon.

688
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:04,078
Get off.

689
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,382
Are you deaf or stupid?

690
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:19,677
Claire, what is your problem?
All right? Relax. Come on.

691
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:22,263
I just don't want you grinding
all your business all over me.

692
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:25,432
Yeah? Well, you didn't seem
to mind my business today in the hot tub.

693
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:26,725
You know, Mickey,

694
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,562
it'd be really nice to have someone
who cared enough to read a situation.

695
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:31,730
The situation is that
it's the last night of college, all right?

696
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:35,234
I could catch action off
any of these girls. All right?

697
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:37,153
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

698
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,781
Well, catch this action, asshole.

699
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:01,844
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

700
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:05,097
I'm a sea pig!

701
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:18,861
Dick!

702
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:34,084
Hey, sweetie. How are you?

703
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,215
So me and Claire just broke up.

704
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:43,219
She hit me. Can you believe it?
It's ridiculous.

705
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:48,641
But you, you look really pretty tonight.
I wanted to tell you that.

706
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:51,143
Really nice. I like this.

707
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:55,814
The whole braid thing you got going.

708
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:02,071
Mickey? If you touch me again,
I'll fucking kill you.

709
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,491
Okay. We'll talk later.

710
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:13,415
Come on, I'll push you up. Go.
Okay.

711
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,417
I can't...

712
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:19,463
Ladies? Girls. I think I know what you want.

713
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:24,677
Show a little skin, you're in.

714
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:27,513
Hmm?

715
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:30,891
Step into my office. Do excuse the mess.

716
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:39,108
Just one flash. That's it.

717
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:40,859
That's negotiable.

718
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,363
What was that?

719
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:47,283
Ladies? Stay. Okay? I got the passes.

720
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:52,204
Hello?

721
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:57,209
Buddy, you graduated. That's awesome.

722
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,211
We're all real impressed.

723
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,046
- However, you're blocking...
- Hey!

724
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,548
- Yeah?
- We're gonna pass.

725
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,301
- No. You're not gonna pass.
- No, you're just a little too creepy.

726
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:09,179
- Yeah. And you're not real hot, either.
- That's not very nice.

727
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,808
Hey, thanks a lot, buddy.

728
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:15,644
Ladies?

729
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:21,025
Ellie? Hey, we were just messing around.

730
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:23,902
It's nothing worth talking to Claire about.

731
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,030
Right, Ellie? Ellie!

732
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:28,741
You're better off
without him, Claire.

733
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,415
I'm really glad you stayed.

734
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,420
Cass, I want you to know that

735
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:45,716
I think it's great
that you've turned into a better person.

736
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:48,761
I have not become a better person.
I'm far from it.

737
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:52,139
No, I mean, with the charity work

738
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:56,435
and all the other stuff you've done
and getting away from this place.

739
00:55:58,813 --> 00:55:59,897
I...

740
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:05,944
We made a huge mistake
not going to the cops.

741
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:09,448
Yeah, we made

742
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,535
a string of bad choices that night.

743
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:16,622
And right now there's not much
we can do about it.

744
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:18,791
We are sisters.

745
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:23,712
And right now all we can do
is stick together and get through this thing.

746
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:25,547
Yeah.

747
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:29,760
Yeah.

748
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,887
Ellie?

749
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:38,477
Ellie?

750
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,146
Are you up here?

751
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:49,196
All right, look, I... I can admit
I've been kind of a jerk, all right?

752
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:55,661
But I promise if you come out,
I'll apologize and we can

753
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,539
kiss and make up.

754
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:03,919
What are you doing?

755
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:05,796
Who the fuck are you?

756
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:21,812
Please! Help me!

757
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:29,445
Please! Help me! Help me, please!

758
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:34,491
That dude's fucking wasted.

759
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,076
Please help me!

760
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:38,954
Why are you doing this to me?

761
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:41,665
Help me! Help me! Help!

762
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,349
Why are you doing this to me?

763
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,894
Oh, my God!

764
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:12,988
Help! Help! Oh, my God!

765
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:17,242
Help me! I need help! Help!

766
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:37,304
I think you need some more mascara.

767
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:41,433
- Yeah, I do. Thanks.
- Yeah.

768
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,479
Oh, God, Ellie's falling apart.

769
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:46,897
What now?

770
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,869
Excuse me, honey.

771
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,204
Is everything okay?

772
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:05,541
Yeah. Ellie's just freaking out. As usual.

773
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:10,170
I thought you said you had everything
under control.

774
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,338
I do.

775
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,467
You better.

776
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:22,975
Ellie? You okay?

777
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:26,687
- What? What now, Ellie?
Enough! Shh!

778
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:31,900
Okay, we don't have time for this.
Just... First word?

779
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:33,485
First syllable?

780
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,697
- Okay, go!
- He was wearing a hooded graduation...

781
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:38,282
Somebody in a graduation gown?

782
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:41,994
A hooded graduation gown?
Ellie, it's Graduation Day.

783
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:44,746
Half the Greek system is
in hooded graduation gowns right now.

784
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:46,373
Did he have two eyes?
Did he have two ears?

785
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:48,166
Okay, stop! Jessica, stop.

786
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,043
- What?
- Let her talk.

787
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:53,672
He... He...

788
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:01,179
Okay, if you can't tell us,
you're going to show us.

789
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:02,639
- No! Please! No!
Okay.

790
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:04,808
- We'll go together. We'll go together.
Ellie!

791
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:08,520
- No!
- Can't we just leave her?

792
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:11,732
You guys go ahead.
I'm gonna stay with her.

793
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:12,899
Good.

794
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:23,452
This is stupid.
We're missing the party of the year.

795
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:26,538
I know. Why couldn't Ellie
have had a nervous breakdown tomorrow?

796
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:30,417
You know, Cassidy, sometimes
when you're sarcastic like that,

797
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:34,504
it really makes you sound like a bitch.
And nobody likes a bitch.

798
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,344
Oh, my God.

799
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:47,142
It's Mickey. I would know
those ugly-ass shoes anywhere.

800
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:48,894
Is he dead?

801
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:53,398
Well, he has a fucking tire iron
through his head.

802
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:57,569
Do you think it's the same one
that killed Megan?

803
01:00:57,612 --> 01:01:00,739
You make it sound like
the tire iron killed Megan by itself.

804
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:03,200
Thank you for the grammar lesson.

805
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:07,496
I'm just saying it looks a little updated,
doesn't it? Like someone's

806
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:09,623
pimped it out.

807
01:01:13,711 --> 01:01:16,046
Oh, my God,
are you seeing this?

808
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:18,090
Who shot this?

809
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:21,176
This is from Megan's phone.
Look at the angle.

810
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:35,607
This can't be Megan.
She's rotting in a mineshaft.

811
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:37,275
This has to be Garret.

812
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,282
We can't let him do that.

813
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:45,951
If Garret or Megan are killing people,

814
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,577
we have bigger problems
than him texting the police.

815
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:49,788
We cannot let Ellie see this text message.

816
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:52,249
Shit. Too late.

817
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:54,918
Okay, I'm gonna go get the Escalade.
And you go round up the girls.

818
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:56,503
Okay. Where are we going?

819
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:58,338
You read the text.
We're gonna go down to the lake

820
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:01,133
and put an end to this once and for all.

821
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,303
- What is it?
- Get in the car. Jessica's driving.

822
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,472
What did you guys find?

823
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:11,685
Mickey is dead. We have to go now, okay?
I'll be there in two minutes.

824
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:14,813
What?

825
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:24,489
- Do I know you?
- I imagine. Yeah.

826
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:27,659
You sell weed on the quad, right?

827
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:31,663
No, I was the valedictorian.
At your graduation?

828
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:35,250
- Today?
- No.

829
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:41,798
- Andy, I really need to talk to you.
- Yeah?

830
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:45,051
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I just...

831
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:48,889
There's something I need to take care of.

832
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:51,683
I want you to go to your parents'
and I'll meet you there tomorrow.

833
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,185
Cass, this is ridiculous. I'll stay.

834
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:55,103
- We'll drive down together.
- No. Just do me this one favor.

835
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,813
I promise I'll tell you everything tomorrow.

836
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:59,816
Just go get in the car.
Go. Okay? For me.

837
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:02,486
All right, fine.

838
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:07,866
Sorry. Just doing a little redecorating.

839
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:20,921
I gotta go.

840
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:31,723
That was so beautiful.

841
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:34,184
- I don't understand. Why Mickey?
I don't know.

842
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:36,394
Maybe because he was a dick.

843
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:39,689
Out of my way, bitches!
Jessica!

844
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:40,732
Chill out!

845
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:45,695
Look, we have 14 minutes before that clip
is sent to the police.

846
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:47,989
I'd rather not spend my childbearing years
in lockup.

847
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,742
Does anyone have a weapon?
Mace? Anything?

848
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:53,620
Yeah, there's a chainsaw
in the glove box.

849
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,918
Ellie, you've got to stop doing that.

850
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:02,254
Where the hell are you going?

851
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,506
Where are you guys going?
Is the party over already?

852
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:06,216
I thought I said not to come.

853
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:09,261
Funny thing. It turns out it's not actually
against Greek rules after all.

854
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:12,848
- Yeah, but we told you to stay away, so...
- Yeah. But then I thought,

855
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:15,517
"Why would I listen to a lying bitch
like you?"

856
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:19,271
By the way, my sister hated you. Peace.

857
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,066
Hey, Jessica, we gotta go.

858
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:24,401
I'm gonna deal with you later.

859
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:28,780
You might want to deal with that hair first,
'cause it looks like shit.

860
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:32,367
Okay.

861
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:37,289
She'd have made a great Theta.

862
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:47,048
Megan's alive, you guys.

863
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:48,967
Ellie, you're being
borderline retarded right now.

864
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:51,678
She's not alive. Garret is doing this.

865
01:04:56,475 --> 01:04:58,768
There should be
a flashlight in there.

866
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:00,937
No, but there's a flare gun.

867
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:04,149
Daddy has an overactive imagination.

868
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:05,650
Good for us.

869
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:10,113
Stay close, okay? Keep our heads on.
This could be anyone.

870
01:05:11,532 --> 01:05:13,241
Okay, so no flashlight.

871
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:16,828
Do we have, like, a lighter?
A light? Anything?

872
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:18,371
Hold on.

873
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:27,422
You know this was all your fault.

874
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:30,008
- You guys made me do this.
- Back the fuck up, psycho!

875
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:32,260
- Calm down. Calm down.
- Calm down?

876
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:34,971
- He killed Mickey.
- You guys, it's the other half.

877
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:37,307
You fucking... You fucking bitches!

878
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:41,394
Where'd you get that jacket?
And whose blood is that on you?

879
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:42,812
It's mine.

880
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:45,607
Fuck you! You made me...

881
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,409
Oh, my God!

882
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:58,536
Take that, you freak show.

883
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,997
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

884
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:03,917
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God, he's not moving.

885
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:06,461
Well, it looks like he won't be sending us
any more video clips.

886
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:08,380
What the fuck did you do, Jessica?

887
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:11,216
- He was coming at you with a knife.
- It was a piece of a mirror!

888
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:14,552
Same diff. Should I have waited for him
to stab you guys?

889
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:17,222
You should be thanking me right now.

890
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:20,141
Okay, three-to-one odds he's still alive.

891
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:34,322
Or not.

892
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:36,408
Garret?

893
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:41,955
My God. He cut his own wrists.

894
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:43,665
No.
- He didn't kill Mickey.

895
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:46,918
No, hold on. Let's take a field trip
to reality for a second.

896
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:51,840
He sent half the jacket to us, killed Mickey
and then slit his wrist in guilt.

897
01:06:51,924 --> 01:06:55,760
You guys, it's not Megan.
We killed her. She's dead.

898
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:59,973
Oh, yeah? Well, he got the same message
we did. From Megan's phone.

899
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:03,893
Now do you believe me? It's Megan.

900
01:07:05,229 --> 01:07:07,605
There's only one way to find out.

901
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:09,107
Oh, Jesus.

902
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:22,370
Slower, slower! Easy.

903
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:32,297
- Give me as much light as you can!
- This is it.

904
01:07:35,634 --> 01:07:36,968
More slack!

905
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:43,475
Wait! The chain!

906
01:07:43,934 --> 01:07:45,310
Oh, my God!

907
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:47,312
Cassidy!

908
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:50,732
Cass!
Cass!

909
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:54,027
Cassidy?

910
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,156
Cassidy, are you okay?

911
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:00,116
Yeah.

912
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:02,869
We're gonna get you
out of there, okay?

913
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:08,625
Oh, my God, Cass!
Sorry.

914
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,503
Nice, Ellie.

915
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:22,972
Do you see Megan down there?
What's going on, Cass?

916
01:08:32,316 --> 01:08:34,109
Can you see anything?

917
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:37,278
Cass?

918
01:08:38,322 --> 01:08:41,116
I see the blanket, but I don't see Megan.

919
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:18,236
- Where is everybody?
- Probably dead.

920
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:21,656
Yeah. And then the corpses
drove their cars home, idiot.

921
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:22,907
Bitch.

922
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:27,704
Bucky? Where did everybody go?

923
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:30,290
After-party at Rho Sigma Nu.

924
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:33,835
- What's that noise?
- The Jacuzzi. It overheated.

925
01:09:33,919 --> 01:09:35,628
See you guys there?

926
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:39,090
I still can't get Chugs
on the phone.

927
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:43,303
Maybe Megan won't kill us.
I mean, we are sisters. Sisters for life, right?

928
01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:46,014
Yeah, that ought to trump
dumping her down a mineshaft.

929
01:09:46,098 --> 01:09:48,600
We cannot just leave his body at the lake.

930
01:09:48,642 --> 01:09:49,934
I don't care what you guys do,

931
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:52,145
but I'm gonna go find Kyle
to make sure he's okay

932
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:54,606
and then I'm getting my stuff
and I'm getting the hell out of here,

933
01:09:54,648 --> 01:09:56,566
and never looking back.

934
01:09:57,318 --> 01:10:00,445
- I'm gonna shut that thing off.
- No! Wait! Don't go alone.

935
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:01,779
I'm good.

936
01:10:21,675 --> 01:10:22,800
Kyle?

937
01:10:26,096 --> 01:10:30,016
Kyle? Kyle? It's me! Kyle?

938
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:55,500
Fuck.

939
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:01,547
Oh!

940
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:03,758
Great.

941
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:18,523
Okay, drunkees, out!

942
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,525
Fine.

943
01:11:22,069 --> 01:11:25,863
Out! Out! Out! Get out!

944
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:27,323
Oh, my gosh! What the fuck?

945
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:29,409
- You're kind of sexy.
- Bye!

946
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:33,454
Come on, baby, let's go.

947
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:35,248
What's your guys' names?

948
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:26,924
Is somebody gonna turn off the music
or do I have to do everything myself?

949
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:32,597
- You okay, Ellie?
- No.

950
01:12:36,643 --> 01:12:40,813
Ellie, come on,
you gotta get it together. Okay?

951
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:44,609
Finally, Chugs.

952
01:12:49,114 --> 01:12:51,991
"Jess, Cass and Ellie,
I'm gonna miss the party. "

953
01:12:58,624 --> 01:12:59,665
No!

954
01:13:00,667 --> 01:13:03,211
How come that didn't include Claire?

955
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:05,838
Oh, gosh! I can't...

956
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:07,632
Door won't open!

957
01:13:07,674 --> 01:13:09,217
Hurry up, Cass!

958
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:11,552
Oh, my God!

959
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:14,555
Give me your hand, Claire.
Give me your hand!

960
01:13:19,311 --> 01:13:21,854
Please, help me, please!

961
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:27,026
Claire, no!

962
01:13:31,865 --> 01:13:34,200
Oh, my God! Help!

963
01:13:39,998 --> 01:13:41,499
- Help!
- Claire!

964
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:54,929
Claire?

965
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:25,918
Go, go! Go, go, go!
What?

966
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:27,378
Kyle!

967
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:34,010
She's here. It's Megan
and she's gonna kill all of us.

968
01:14:34,052 --> 01:14:35,511
It's okay. It's okay.

969
01:14:37,097 --> 01:14:38,806
- Let's go. Come on, Ellie!
- Oh, my God!

970
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:39,974
Kyle?

971
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:42,560
Kyle?

972
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:44,437
Kyle!

973
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:48,566
Oh, God.

974
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:51,527
Kyle, is that you?

975
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:55,323
Kyle?

976
01:14:59,912 --> 01:15:04,373
- What are you doing in my bed?
- Oh, I met the cutest boy.

977
01:15:04,416 --> 01:15:06,250
- This one.
- That's my boy.

978
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:07,752
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

979
01:15:07,794 --> 01:15:10,713
Awkward. Anyways, you mind giving us
a little space?

980
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:13,591
We were just kind of getting started
when you pulled up, and...

981
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:18,596
By the way, I know
you fucked Megan's boyfriend. She told me.

982
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:22,517
- Hmm. Payback's such a bitch.
- You're a bitch!

983
01:15:28,398 --> 01:15:29,607
Stop it!

984
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:33,444
You're such a whore!

985
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,325
- I'll kill you.
- She's in the house.

986
01:15:39,409 --> 01:15:42,036
- Who's in the house?
- Shut the fuck up!

987
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:45,206
Stop it!

988
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:55,925
Screw this.

989
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:30,751
Mrs. Crenshaw, it's me, Jessica.

990
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:33,838
I know. You've had that
coming for four years.

991
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:35,673
I saw what you did.

992
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:39,176
We didn't mean to kill Megan.

993
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:41,429
What?

994
01:16:41,513 --> 01:16:44,432
Kill Megan?
I was talking about trashing my house.

995
01:16:44,516 --> 01:16:47,810
You killed my sister? You fucking bitch!

996
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:53,190
- Talk.
- Okay, listen. It was an accident

997
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:55,860
and we'll explain everything later,
but right now Claire is dead,

998
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:59,447
Mickey's dead, Chugs is dead
and we don't know if Megan is alive or not.

999
01:16:59,531 --> 01:17:01,699
Wait. So Megan is not dead?

1000
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:04,827
We don't know!
We need to get the hell out of here.

1001
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,912
- Who else is here?
- Kyle.

1002
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:09,498
- Is he in on this thing?
- No.

1003
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:15,046
- Lie to me again.
- Okay, I told Kyle about Megan.

1004
01:17:15,088 --> 01:17:19,216
Of course, you did!
What's with this "sisters for life" crap?

1005
01:17:19,259 --> 01:17:22,511
Was I the only one that didn't tell anybody?

1006
01:17:22,554 --> 01:17:24,055
Where is Kyle?

1007
01:17:25,015 --> 01:17:28,476
Don't look at me.
He left as soon as he heard you coming.

1008
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:32,063
Well, he, she or it
is about to get two rounds to the face.

1009
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:35,566
You girls wait in Jessica's room.
And call the police.

1010
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:39,111
Wow, who knew Mrs. Crenshaw
was such a badass?

1011
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:40,237
Where's your phone?

1012
01:17:41,114 --> 01:17:42,198
Mine?

1013
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:45,076
I don't know.
I think I dropped it somewhere.

1014
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:47,453
Where's your phone, Ellie? Ellie!

1015
01:17:47,537 --> 01:17:49,246
I don't really know
where my phone is right now.

1016
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:52,249
I've had kind of a crazy day.
And I don't really...

1017
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:55,753
There's been a lot of shit
going down here.

1018
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:58,047
So can you just give me a minute?

1019
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:01,175
I don't understand. You're saying
that you think my sister's alive?

1020
01:18:01,259 --> 01:18:03,010
We don't know anything for sure, Maggie.

1021
01:18:06,264 --> 01:18:10,601
- Maybe she got her.
- Oh, my God! No! Megan!

1022
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:13,437
- No, don't go out there.
Wait. Wait.

1023
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:16,023
What? I tried to warn her.

1024
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:36,961
Come to mama.

1025
01:18:52,352 --> 01:18:54,645
Please don't think I'm afraid of you.

1026
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:57,648
I run a house with 50 crazy bitches.

1027
01:18:58,650 --> 01:19:00,401
You guys, that's coming
from the back of the house.

1028
01:19:00,485 --> 01:19:01,527
We can make a run for it.

1029
01:19:01,611 --> 01:19:04,655
You guys can do whatever you want.
I'm staying here.

1030
01:19:04,698 --> 01:19:07,658
If I can get to Mickey's body,
I can get his phone and we can call for help.

1031
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:09,326
Okay, well, I'm going with you.

1032
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:13,497
Okay, I could use your cover with the ax.
But you work with me, understand?

1033
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:15,666
I don't want to turn around
and not be able to find you.

1034
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:19,837
Cassidy! Seriously?
After everything we've been through?

1035
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:23,841
Okay, Ellie? If you get a chance to run,
take it. Don't worry about us.

1036
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:25,301
- Okay.
Okay.

1037
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:34,685
Meg?

1038
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:41,317
Megan?

1039
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:44,111
It's Mags.

1040
01:20:15,852 --> 01:20:16,977
God!

1041
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:40,835
You stay the fuck away from my girls.

1042
01:20:47,759 --> 01:20:48,926
Megan?

1043
01:20:56,059 --> 01:20:57,393
You there?

1044
01:21:10,156 --> 01:21:12,533
Megan? Is that you?

1045
01:21:16,329 --> 01:21:17,663
Oh, my God.

1046
01:21:28,675 --> 01:21:30,593
I have to do something.

1047
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:37,099
Okay, okay.

1048
01:21:40,687 --> 01:21:41,770
Shit.

1049
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:53,657
Come on.

1050
01:21:57,329 --> 01:21:59,246
Please, God, don't let me get killed.

1051
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:03,167
- Please, God, don't let me get killed.
- Stop giving him ideas.

1052
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:06,712
- Okay.
- Come on.

1053
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:17,181
Kyle?

1054
01:22:19,225 --> 01:22:20,809
What are you doing here?

1055
01:22:20,852 --> 01:22:24,229
When I heard you calling, I was...

1056
01:22:24,314 --> 01:22:25,564
I heard gunshots.

1057
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:29,985
- Why are you wearing that gown?
- And why aren't you wearing any pants?

1058
01:22:30,028 --> 01:22:32,947
- I threw something on, because...
- You fucked her, didn't you?

1059
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:34,657
- I need you to get a hold of yourself.
- You fucked her!

1060
01:22:34,699 --> 01:22:36,825
Don't tell me to calm down!

1061
01:22:40,246 --> 01:22:42,748
I warned you, Jessica.

1062
01:22:42,832 --> 01:22:45,834
You just couldn't hold it together,
could you?

1063
01:22:47,003 --> 01:22:51,090
Put the ax down.
Honey, I really don't want to hurt you.

1064
01:22:54,761 --> 01:22:57,054
What do you think you're doing?

1065
01:22:59,099 --> 01:23:01,141
Give me the phone!

1066
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:02,685
Can't breathe.

1067
01:23:02,727 --> 01:23:05,270
I told you, Jessica, this can't get out.

1068
01:23:05,355 --> 01:23:06,563
Jessica, help me!

1069
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:08,899
Help? Don't you know anything
about Jessica?

1070
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,567
She's a power whore.

1071
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:13,237
She'll do anything, as long...

1072
01:23:13,279 --> 01:23:16,865
As long as you keep your dick
in your pants, scumbag.

1073
01:23:16,908 --> 01:23:18,409
Are you crazy?

1074
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:22,955
Do you have any idea
what my father is capable of?

1075
01:23:23,039 --> 01:23:26,583
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe
I'm fucking the wrong guy!

1076
01:23:26,626 --> 01:23:29,712
- That's it.
- Cassidy! Shit!

1077
01:23:29,754 --> 01:23:32,923
- Some sister she turned out to be.
- Hey, asshole!

1078
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:39,179
Come on! Come on, come on, come on.

1079
01:23:41,057 --> 01:23:42,433
The window!

1080
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:47,896
- Shit! The scaffolding.
- Well, good plan!

1081
01:23:47,939 --> 01:23:52,443
Come on, Jess! Cass? Let's hug it out.

1082
01:23:54,821 --> 01:23:57,114
Okay. Who the hell lit the house
on fire? Shit!

1083
01:23:57,198 --> 01:23:58,574
Oh, my God.

1084
01:23:58,616 --> 01:24:00,117
Ladies?

1085
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:12,129
Jessica! Come on, babe. I'm sorry.

1086
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:22,306
Come on.

1087
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:38,655
- Oh, my God! It's Megan! Oh, my God!
- She looks terrible.

1088
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:56,048
I'm really starting to think
he's not marriage material.

1089
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:03,013
My dad

1090
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:05,182
is gonna be

1091
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:07,392
very angry.

1092
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:18,862
I can't let my father hang out to dry for this.

1093
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:22,491
And we're not leaving here
until we come up with a story.

1094
01:25:24,702 --> 01:25:27,871
I guess your boyfriend's not here
to protect you, huh?

1095
01:25:35,713 --> 01:25:38,048
- Guess again.
- Andy?

1096
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:39,466
It's okay.

1097
01:25:39,843 --> 01:25:42,052
- Oh, my God. You didn't leave?
- It's okay.

1098
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:45,097
I couldn't, Cass. I knew you were in trouble.

1099
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:49,977
What... What happened?

1100
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:53,897
- This place isn't safe.
- You saved me.

1101
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:57,067
Yeah. And I always will.

1102
01:25:57,735 --> 01:26:00,612
You don't need this place. These people.

1103
01:26:01,364 --> 01:26:04,908
I'm the one who's never gonna let anything
happen to you.

1104
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:20,757
Oh, my God.

1105
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:26,597
- What?
- You?

1106
01:26:27,891 --> 01:26:28,932
You?

1107
01:26:29,809 --> 01:26:32,603
You know what? It's okay. This is okay.

1108
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:37,649
We can fix this. I mean, this is fixable, so...

1109
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:42,905
Andy, you can count on us.
The five tenets of sister...

1110
01:26:45,116 --> 01:26:48,785
That girl really needs to learn
to keep her mouth shut.

1111
01:26:48,828 --> 01:26:53,248
I know, Cassidy. I know everything.
Ellie told me.

1112
01:26:54,083 --> 01:26:59,046
Some of the things she said
about some of the things you did...

1113
01:27:00,673 --> 01:27:03,050
- You killed...
- I freed us.

1114
01:27:04,969 --> 01:27:06,011
Hey.

1115
01:27:06,304 --> 01:27:07,638
Admit it.

1116
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:11,475
These are horrible people. Playing house.

1117
01:27:11,559 --> 01:27:14,686
Sitting around circling each other's fat.
Drinking their lives away.

1118
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:17,356
You've been trying to get away for a year.

1119
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:20,817
- I'm just helping you cut the cord.
- You killed everybody.

1120
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:23,528
Well, everybody that knew had to die.

1121
01:27:23,613 --> 01:27:24,988
Claire, Chugs.

1122
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:27,824
You told Crenshaw. Jessica told Kyle.

1123
01:27:27,867 --> 01:27:29,952
And I'm sure Claire told Mickey.

1124
01:27:29,994 --> 01:27:32,913
You know, and even if she didn't,
that guy really was a dick.

1125
01:27:32,997 --> 01:27:34,790
I didn't kill Garret.

1126
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:36,625
Give me some credit there.

1127
01:27:36,668 --> 01:27:38,502
Now, then again,
that kid was so ready to snap,

1128
01:27:38,586 --> 01:27:41,505
he had the suicide hotline on speed dial.

1129
01:27:41,547 --> 01:27:44,299
I'm feeling
a little under-appreciated here, Cassidy.

1130
01:27:44,342 --> 01:27:47,552
Don't you see?
You've been attached to this forever.

1131
01:27:47,637 --> 01:27:49,221
One of them gets drunk, gets blabby.

1132
01:27:49,305 --> 01:27:51,265
Some girl overhears it in the bathroom.

1133
01:27:51,349 --> 01:27:53,141
Another spills the beans to her therapist.

1134
01:27:53,184 --> 01:27:56,561
Do you really want to be dealing
with this for the rest of your life?

1135
01:27:56,646 --> 01:27:58,689
For the rest of our lives?

1136
01:27:59,816 --> 01:28:03,527
Now today I gave the valedictorian speech.
Remember?

1137
01:28:04,153 --> 01:28:07,072
"Reputation comes
from the company you keep. "

1138
01:28:07,949 --> 01:28:09,950
And the company you keep?

1139
01:28:11,369 --> 01:28:12,577
Bitches.

1140
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:17,249
Do you know what that word "valedictorian"
comes from?

1141
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:19,751
It's from the Latin. Vale dicere.

1142
01:28:21,212 --> 01:28:22,879
"To say farewell. "

1143
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:26,800
Well, to the bitches of Theta Pi,

1144
01:28:28,761 --> 01:28:30,554
I'm saying farewell.

1145
01:28:32,181 --> 01:28:33,765
Are you with me?

1146
01:28:42,233 --> 01:28:43,567
Yes.

1147
01:28:43,651 --> 01:28:45,485
I knew you would be.

1148
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:50,615
It's for the best. For us. For our future.
Hell, for society in general.

1149
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:53,452
Great.

1150
01:28:58,708 --> 01:29:00,959
Now let's go kill Ellie,
then we're off to my folks' summer house

1151
01:29:01,044 --> 01:29:02,377
for some well-deserved R&R.

1152
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:05,589
- Wait. Ellie?
- Of course. Come on, we'll both do Ellie.

1153
01:29:05,631 --> 01:29:07,758
You're always saying
we need to do more stuff together.

1154
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:11,094
I'm with you on everything, but Ellie?
I mean, she's okay.

1155
01:29:11,137 --> 01:29:12,929
You're joking, right?

1156
01:29:13,765 --> 01:29:16,933
She's the weakest of them all.
Hell, she told me.

1157
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:21,730
But, Andy, the house is on fire.
We gotta go.

1158
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:23,815
We better move fast.

1159
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:29,279
Call her name.

1160
01:29:29,947 --> 01:29:31,948
- Ellie will come to you.
- Ellie!

1161
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:35,285
Ellie! Hey, Andy,
we need to leave right now, okay?

1162
01:29:36,662 --> 01:29:39,998
Okay. You go wait for me outside.

1163
01:29:41,084 --> 01:29:43,377
- I'll take care of Ellie.
- Okay.

1164
01:29:56,974 --> 01:29:59,476
Go tell Ellie to meet me in the basement.

1165
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:01,520
There's the team spirit.

1166
01:30:08,694 --> 01:30:09,861
Ellie?

1167
01:30:12,115 --> 01:30:14,491
Ellie, where are you? Come on, come on.

1168
01:30:14,575 --> 01:30:16,952
- What? What?
- Okay, we've got to get out of here now.

1169
01:30:16,994 --> 01:30:18,328
- Is it safe?
- No, it's not safe,

1170
01:30:18,371 --> 01:30:19,579
but it's not getting any safer.

1171
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:20,872
What?

1172
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:28,964
Why would you lie to me? Why?

1173
01:30:29,006 --> 01:30:31,550
Do you have any idea
what I've done to give you back your life?

1174
01:30:31,634 --> 01:30:33,009
Ellie, run!

1175
01:30:39,559 --> 01:30:42,227
I am very, very disappointed in you.

1176
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:49,443
I pinned you, and you left.

1177
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:51,486
I guess my cell phone
took a Greyhound out of town.

1178
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:53,071
Yeah, good one.

1179
01:30:58,661 --> 01:31:01,830
Help! Ellie! Cassidy!

1180
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:05,542
Help! It's Maggie! I'm trapped!

1181
01:31:08,588 --> 01:31:09,671
Help!

1182
01:31:11,507 --> 01:31:12,716
Help me!

1183
01:31:18,973 --> 01:31:20,140
Maggie!

1184
01:31:21,058 --> 01:31:23,059
I'm trapped!
- Fuck. Okay.

1185
01:31:26,105 --> 01:31:28,607
- Okay, try and jump over.
- What?

1186
01:31:28,691 --> 01:31:30,901
I left your sister.
I'm not gonna leave you, too.

1187
01:31:30,943 --> 01:31:32,819
Get the fuck over here.

1188
01:31:32,904 --> 01:31:33,904
Oh!

1189
01:31:34,238 --> 01:31:36,198
I'm getting goose bumps.

1190
01:31:38,701 --> 01:31:40,744
You might want to stay there, Maggie.

1191
01:31:40,828 --> 01:31:43,413
Out of the fire, into the tire iron.
Do you know what I mean?

1192
01:31:43,456 --> 01:31:44,539
Andy, leave her alone!

1193
01:31:44,582 --> 01:31:47,250
Come over here,
I'll be happy to kill you first.

1194
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:59,596
Not to worry, Maggie.

1195
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:03,099
What kind of guy would I be
if I let you burn to death?

1196
01:32:07,146 --> 01:32:09,940
- Andy, don't do this!
- Stop it! Just stop it!

1197
01:32:10,024 --> 01:32:13,109
I will, but you need to stand perfectly still.

1198
01:32:30,419 --> 01:32:31,503
Hey.

1199
01:32:33,714 --> 01:32:37,467
Come on, Maggie!
Come on, get over! Come on.

1200
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:41,096
- Maggie! Come on, come on, come on.
- Watch out!

1201
01:32:41,806 --> 01:32:44,474
Oh, my God! Get off of her!

1202
01:32:56,362 --> 01:32:57,654
Oh, fuck!

1203
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:05,537
- Andy, please help me.
- I tried to help you.

1204
01:33:06,706 --> 01:33:08,748
You didn't want my help, remember?

1205
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:11,543
Do you know how many times
I tried to get you to tell me the truth?

1206
01:33:11,627 --> 01:33:13,503
I practically begged you.

1207
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:19,801
But no.
You decided to protect your girlfriends.

1208
01:33:20,845 --> 01:33:23,179
I loved you so much, Cass.

1209
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:27,350
I thought you were different.
But as it turns out, you were just the same.

1210
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:29,227
Sisters till the end.

1211
01:33:31,731 --> 01:33:34,816
Well, as this year's valedictorian,

1212
01:33:36,235 --> 01:33:39,362
- I guess it's time to say...
- Farewell, asshole.

1213
01:34:03,262 --> 01:34:06,222
Maggie, use the curtain to wrap yourself up.

1214
01:34:09,685 --> 01:34:11,144
Grab my hand.

1215
01:34:24,450 --> 01:34:26,034
I thought I told you to get out of here.

1216
01:34:26,077 --> 01:34:29,371
You did,
but then I thought, "What are sisters for?"

1217
01:34:31,457 --> 01:34:34,125
Don't touch me, trust me

1218
01:34:34,210 --> 01:34:35,669
You disgust me

1219
01:34:35,753 --> 01:34:39,881
Tried to shove me
in your daddy's money

1220
01:34:39,924 --> 01:34:42,384
But I'm better on my own

1221
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:46,096
I've got some things
that I do better on my own

1222
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:51,601
I'll show you how
you turn my insides out

1223
01:34:51,852 --> 01:34:53,937
Get the hell away from me

1224
01:34:54,021 --> 01:34:56,481
It's an emergency

1225
01:34:56,899 --> 01:34:59,609
Turn me black and blue

1226
01:35:00,194 --> 01:35:02,278
Get the hell away from me

1227
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:04,614
All of my friends agree

1228
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:07,784
I gotta run away from you

1229
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:16,918
The house is clear.
Come on, let's go.

1230
01:35:29,974 --> 01:35:34,436
Do you remember all we had?

1231
01:35:36,021 --> 01:35:39,107
How we loved it all

1232
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:42,819
Such a perfect world

1233
01:35:44,530 --> 01:35:47,490
We trusted all

1234
01:35:51,537 --> 01:36:04,090
Theta Pi says goodbye!
Theta Pi says goodbye!

1235
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:26,988
Don't push it
your bullshit don't phase me

1236
01:36:27,031 --> 01:36:31,159
You can cut me but I won't bleed baby

1237
01:36:31,202 --> 01:36:34,037
'Cause I'm better on my own

1238
01:36:34,121 --> 01:36:38,208
I've got some things
that I do better on my own

1239
01:36:38,292 --> 01:36:42,545
I'll show you how
you turn yourself around

1240
01:36:43,214 --> 01:36:47,383
Get the hell away from me
It's an emergency

1241
01:36:48,385 --> 01:36:51,012
Turn me black and blue

1242
01:36:51,555 --> 01:36:55,725
Get the hell away from me
All of my friends agree

1243
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:59,229
I gotta break away from you

1244
01:37:02,024 --> 01:37:04,984
Do you remember all we had?

1245
01:37:06,445 --> 01:37:09,322
How we loved it all

1246
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:13,493
Such a perfect world

1247
01:37:14,787 --> 01:37:18,039
That we trusted all

1248
01:37:19,041 --> 01:37:21,084
Now it's time

1249
01:37:21,126 --> 01:37:23,127
To let go

1250
01:37:34,348 --> 01:37:38,434
Baby don't touch me, trust me
Don't touch me

1251
01:37:38,519 --> 01:37:41,604
Baby don't touch me, trust me

1252
01:37:41,647 --> 01:37:45,817
Get the hell away from me
It's an emergency

1253
01:37:46,819 --> 01:37:49,445
Turn me black and blue

1254
01:37:49,989 --> 01:37:53,992
Get the hell away from me
All of my friends agree

1255
01:37:54,076 --> 01:37:57,787
I gotta break away from you

1256
01:37:59,123 --> 01:38:02,458
Get the hell away from me
It's an emergency

1257
01:38:02,793 --> 01:38:06,129
Better on my own
Turn me black and blue

1258
01:38:06,672 --> 01:38:10,800
Get the hell away from me
All of my friends agree

1259
01:38:11,176 --> 01:38:14,554
Better on my own
And away from you

1260
01:38:23,564 --> 01:38:26,566
Headlights tearing through the fog

1261
01:38:26,650 --> 01:38:29,652
Top down, hear the engine call

1262
01:38:29,695 --> 01:38:32,739
So cold, burning through the black

1263
01:38:32,823 --> 01:38:35,825
Wait up, daddy's coming back

1264
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:38,870
You're so alone
Back at the door

1265
01:38:38,954 --> 01:38:41,956
I'm coming home
Back at the door

1266
01:38:41,999 --> 01:38:45,043
You need your fix
Back at the door

1267
01:38:45,127 --> 01:38:48,379
Gonna give you more

1268
01:38:48,505 --> 01:38:51,174
Coming down, gonna take you away

1269
01:38:51,258 --> 01:38:54,177
This night won't wait for you

1270
01:38:54,219 --> 01:38:57,138
I'm the one you love, gonna take you away

1271
01:38:57,306 --> 01:39:00,350
This night won't wait for you

1272
01:39:00,434 --> 01:39:06,689
Every time I brake into the light
I glance a moment in your eyes

1273
01:39:06,941 --> 01:39:09,943
I can taste your cries
