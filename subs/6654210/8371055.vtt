696
00:50:02.958 --> 00:50:05.002

698
00:50:08.755 --> 00:50:10.382

699
00:50:10.465 --> 00:50:12.801

-(KNOCKING)
-Come in.

701
00:50:22.394 --> 00:50:24.062
Is it okay if I look around?

702
00:50:24.146 --> 00:50:25.814
Be my guest.

703
00:50:45.375 --> 00:50:47.336
These are all you, aren't they?

704
00:50:48.587 --> 00:50:50.464
They're people I once was.

705
00:50:51.965 --> 00:50:53.175
All of them.

706
00:50:56.053 --> 00:50:57.554
Wow.

707
00:50:57.638 --> 00:50:59.973
That's cool. You look happy.

708
00:51:01.475 --> 00:51:02.935
I was.

709
00:51:04.144 --> 00:51:05.771
Who's that guy?

710
00:51:05.854 --> 00:51:08.357
In that picture, he was Abel.

711
00:51:09.608 --> 00:51:14.238
Before then, other names, other faces.

712
00:51:14.321 --> 00:51:15.822
But the soul...

713
00:51:16.782 --> 00:51:18.867
the soul was always him.

714
00:51:18.951 --> 00:51:21.828
So, what? You loved each other
through multiple lives?

715
00:51:22.788 --> 00:51:24.915
These are all the same place.

716
00:51:24.998 --> 00:51:28.001

717
00:51:30.128 --> 00:51:33.173
I'll find you in the Beginning.

718
00:51:33.257 --> 00:51:34.549
ABEL: I love you.

719
00:51:34.633 --> 00:51:38.220
When each of us
would find ourselves in a new life,

720
00:51:38.303 --> 00:51:40.013
this is where Abel and I would go.

721
00:51:40.097 --> 00:51:42.391
You're reincarnated.
How would you know where to go?

722
00:51:43.642 --> 00:51:47.396
Most of us have a reawakening
that begins young.

723
00:51:47.479 --> 00:51:50.107
Starts with small things, memories,

724
00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:52.359
feelings about a place, dreams.

725
00:51:53.235 --> 00:51:54.861
By puberty,

726
00:51:54.945 --> 00:51:56.947
most Infinites have full recall.

727
00:51:57.030 --> 00:52:00.909
(SCOFFS) Right around the time
they diagnosed me schizophrenic.

728
00:52:02.369 --> 00:52:04.538
So what happened if you died young
and got separated?

729
00:52:05.122 --> 00:52:06.331
For an Infinite...

730
00:52:07.499 --> 00:52:09.459
death isn't the end, it's like...

731
00:52:10.335 --> 00:52:12.629

732
00:52:12.713 --> 00:52:15.340

always meeting back at the same place.

735
00:52:24.182 --> 00:52:25.183
He was Dethroned.

736
00:52:28.145 --> 00:52:30.314
He's trapped on a computer somewhere.

737
00:52:31.481 --> 00:52:34.985
My last life, I got my memories back...

738
00:52:36.695 --> 00:52:38.322
and realized he was gone.

739
00:52:46.538 --> 00:52:48.832
It's not my memories that matter, Evan.

740
00:52:50.667 --> 00:52:51.668
It's yours.

00:52:58.592 --> 00:53:01.178

Between the car accident, the electroshock

758
00:54:12.749 --> 00:54:15.836
and the steel plate in his head,
his mind is fractured.

759
00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:18.088
Something in there
won't let the memories flow.

760

I'm afraid the Artisan is our last hope.
