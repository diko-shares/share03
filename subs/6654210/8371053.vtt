00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:56.138
<i>There are among us a people,</i>

2
00:00:56.223 --> 00:01:00.184
<i>gifted with a perfect memory
of all their past lives.</i>

3
00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:03.187
<i>They call themselves... Infinites.</i>

4
00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:09.944
<i>Among the Infinites,
two groups have vied for power.</i>

5
00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:12.404
<i>On one side the Believers,</i>

6
00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:14.073
<i>dedicated to using their knowledge</i>

7
00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:17.326
<i>for the protection and growth
of all humanity.</i>

8
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.828
<i>Against them stand the Nihilists,</i>

9
00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:22.206
<i>who see this power as a curse.</i>

10
00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:25.584
<i>New technologies have given the Nihilists</i>

11
00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:28.587
<i>an opportunity to end all life on Earth.</i>

12
00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:32.299
<i>And the race is on for its control.</i>

13
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.750
<i>Treadway, tell me you got it.</i>

14
00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:09.837
Yeah. Yeah, I got it. I got it.

15
00:02:20.724 --> 00:02:21.974
<i>Might be delayed a little.</i>

16
00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:24.018
<i>-I'm headed to meet you now.</i>
-Copy that.

17
00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:46.999
<i>Treadway, you okay?</i>

18
00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:48.751
We can't let him get the Egg back.

19
00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.881
I can't believe
Bathurst would go this far.

20
00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:55.125
He's not the man we remember.

21
00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:57.051
Shit.

22
00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.400
Shit.

23
00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:40.135
Abel, I'm gonna take a shortcut.
Meet me at the freeway.

24
00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:19.735
They got it blocked off.

25
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.197
-Get to the base of the crane.
-Treadway, listen.

26
00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:24.656
Do not go up that bridge.

27
00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:35.792
<i>Treadway? Treadway?</i>

28
00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:40.672
Abel, listen to me.

29
00:05:41.674 --> 00:05:44.092
If I fail, look inside.

30
00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:46.405
I don't know what miracle
you think you're gonna pull off,

31
00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:49.056
but there's a 150-foot gap
in front of you.

32
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.807
What is his plan?

33
00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:51.618
Leona. Please.

34
00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:56.832
Leona, wake up. Wake up.

35
00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:28.614
I'll find you in the Beginning.

36
00:07:29.657 --> 00:07:30.657
I love you.

37
00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:55.557
<i>Did you ever have a dream so real...
it felt like a memory?</i>

38
00:07:57.518 --> 00:08:00.312
<i>You ever catch yourself in the mirror
and it's a surprise?</i>

39
00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:04.066
<i>Like you expected to see
someone else's face</i>

40
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.442
<i>staring back at you.</i>

41
00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:13.700
<i>All these people all going somewhere,
all doing something.</i>

42
00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:15.869
<i>But what does it all add up to?</i>

43
00:08:16.537 --> 00:08:17.954
<i>Maybe if I knew the answer,</i>

44
00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:20.165
<i>all the little things
might click together.</i>

45
00:08:20.249 --> 00:08:21.792
{\an8}<i>They might make sense.</i>

46
00:08:22.543 --> 00:08:24.920
{\an8}<i>-Hey. Hi.
-Evan. Right on time.</i>

47
00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:26.963
Nice to see you. How are ya?

48
00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:29.424
-Any trouble getting here?
-No. No, not at all.

49
00:08:30.843 --> 00:08:32.803
<i>Third interview this week.</i>

50
00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:34.596
-Here he is.
-Hey, gentlemen.

51
00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:36.014
Hey. How are you?

52
00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:38.266
-Pleasure to meet you.
-Evan, great to meet you.

53
00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:39.870
Thank you for your time.
I really appreciate it.

54
00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:41.603
-Right.
-Wow.

55
00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:43.939
Beautiful place you have here.
Absolutely gorgeous.

56
00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:46.483
I just got a couple questions
if you don't mind.

57
00:08:46.567 --> 00:08:47.901
Of course.

58
00:08:47.985 --> 00:08:52.906
There are a couple of question marks
in your past.

59
00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:54.658
I recognize that.

60
00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:58.578
You're the first face people see

61
00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:01.081
when they walk into my restaurant.

62
00:09:01.165 --> 00:09:02.582
And they'd be greeted with a smile.

63
00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:05.210
I have had some issues in the past.

64
00:09:05.294 --> 00:09:07.546
I did a full background check
on you, Mr. McCauley.

65
00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:10.674
I spoke to some of your past employers.

66
00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:15.053
And you know what?
They all said the same thing.

67
00:09:15.888 --> 00:09:18.140
I'm interested to hear
what they had to say.

68
00:09:18.766 --> 00:09:22.144
They say you're great!
They say you're smart. He's a smart guy.

69
00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:24.104
Smart guy right here, huh?

70
00:09:24.188 --> 00:09:26.440
That's all good.
I guess I've got the job then.

71
00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:27.983
When do I start?

72
00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:31.361
Tell me about the customer you attacked.

73
00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:33.530
He assaulted a waitress.

74
00:09:33.614 --> 00:09:34.948
So you broke his arm.

75
00:09:35.032 --> 00:09:37.325
I did. It was unintentional.

76
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.579
Excuse me, but he grabbed her ass.

77
00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:44.291
I asked him to leave politely.
He put his hands on me.

78
00:09:44.375 --> 00:09:46.668
No charges were ever filed.
Everything was dismissed.

79
00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:49.880
So you just walked out
of a shift at Locanda

80
00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:52.799
and you never came back?

81
00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:55.010
I had a personal issue.
That was six years ago.

82
00:09:55.094 --> 00:09:58.722
Yeah, your manager told me
that you were institutionalized.

83
00:10:00.099 --> 00:10:02.419
-For two weeks.
-Two weeks. Melanie, it's just two weeks.

84
00:10:02.477 --> 00:10:03.810
Just two weeks.

85
00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:08.064
Look. My struggles with mental illness
are a part of my past.

86
00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:10.942
I haven't had so much
as an eye twitch since.

87
00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:12.027
I think, if anything,

88
00:10:12.111 --> 00:10:14.988
getting through what I've been through
only makes me stronger.

89
00:10:15.072 --> 00:10:19.326
And I am 100% confident
in my ability to manage here.

90
00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:21.745
Thanks for coming in today, Evan.

91
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:24.289
Please. Look, I know what it looks like.

92
00:10:24.373 --> 00:10:27.125
But my illness isn't an issue
you have to worry about.

93
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:30.462
-I promise you-- 
-Hey, we'll be in touch, okay?

94
00:10:35.676 --> 00:10:36.802
No, you won't.

95
00:10:37.386 --> 00:10:38.553
Excuse me?

96
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:41.473
Look, I know the brush-off when I hear it.

97
00:10:41.557 --> 00:10:46.728
Mr. McCauley, you are clearly awesome
at dealing with conflict.

98
00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:48.146
You have no idea.

99
00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:50.899
Thanks for coming in. But you're right.

100
00:10:50.983 --> 00:10:53.527
I don't think I will need
to be calling you.

101
00:10:54.737 --> 00:10:57.364
You think you know my story
because you ran a background check

102
00:10:57.448 --> 00:10:58.865
and made a couple of phone calls?

103
00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:02.953
I knew yours when I shook
your well-moisturized hand.

104
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.330
Thank you for your time.

105
00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:08.208
<i>I get it. I do.</i>

106
00:11:08.292 --> 00:11:10.252
<i>Who's going to hire
a diagnosed schizophrenic</i>

107
00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:11.503
<i>with a history of violence,</i>

108
00:11:11.587 --> 00:11:15.131
<i>when there's a dozen candidates out there
with sparkling clean records?</i>

109
00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:18.301
<i>But what's really on my mind
is if I can't get a job,</i>

110
00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:19.719
<i>I can't pay rent this month.</i>

111
00:11:21.472 --> 00:11:24.349
<i>I mean, dry-cleaning this suit
wasn't exactly free.</i>

112
00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:30.689
<i>And more than that, I've gotta get
something together real quick,</i>

113
00:11:30.773 --> 00:11:32.941
<i>because these meds, they're running out.</i>

114
00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:35.193
<i>And once they do, shit gets real.</i>

115
00:11:56.632 --> 00:11:58.633
<i>Are there things you just know how to do?</i>

116
00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:02.804
<i>Like, no one's ever showed you.</i>

117
00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:07.225
<i>Somehow each step
in the process makes sense.</i>

118
00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:25.577
<i>Like you're remembering it.</i>

119
00:12:26.787 --> 00:12:28.079
<i>Not learning it.</i>

120
00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:48.308
For reals, you really
made that shit yourself, man?

121
00:12:48.392 --> 00:12:50.560
-Yep.
-Damn.

122
00:12:50.645 --> 00:12:53.355
Hey, yo, Ronny. Yo, Ronny.

123
00:12:54.023 --> 00:12:55.732
-Evan, man.
-Hey.

124
00:12:57.193 --> 00:13:01.112
As requested.
Kimotsuki-styled iron. Handcrafted.

125
00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:02.364
One of a kind.

126
00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:05.450
Oh, hell, yeah.

127
00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:10.038
Hattori Hanzo, yo.

128
00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:13.416
-Damn. Nice.
-Goddamn.

129
00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:14.793
Get off me.

130
00:13:14.877 --> 00:13:17.212
Now, let's get this man paid.

131
00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:19.547
You get high off this shit?

132
00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:21.841
No. Clozapine. It's an antipsychotic.

133
00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:24.094
You get paid in pills?

134
00:13:24.178 --> 00:13:25.720
Evan here's on "Ronny-care."

135
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:28.390
Yeah. Dr. Ronny.

136
00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:31.059
Why don't you, like,
get them at Duane Reade?

137
00:13:31.143 --> 00:13:33.645
'Cause Evan don't wanna talk
to shrinks every two weeks, right?

138
00:13:33.729 --> 00:13:36.272
Yeah. Evan can't afford
400 bucks a month on a scrip.

139
00:13:36.357 --> 00:13:37.983
Yo, Wikipedia.

140
00:13:38.609 --> 00:13:42.404
-What's the capital of Brakina Fatso?
-Yeah.

141
00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:44.239
It's pronounced Burkina Faso.

142
00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:46.116
Ouagadougou.
Could I have my pills, please?

143
00:13:48.285 --> 00:13:50.745
Shit, man. Forgot my count, man.

144
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.288
You made that up.

145
00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:56.292
Damn, man!

146
00:13:58.004 --> 00:14:02.841
Nah. Homeboy knows everything. He a freak.

147
00:14:03.592 --> 00:14:05.218
How do you know so much?

148
00:14:05.302 --> 00:14:06.803
Honestly, I wish I knew.

149
00:14:06.887 --> 00:14:08.138
Makes me nuts.

150
00:14:08.764 --> 00:14:10.473
Could I have my pills, please?

151
00:14:14.103 --> 00:14:18.273
Dang, girl. You eyeballing my boy
like he a steak dinner.

152
00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:23.194
Yo, yo. What's gunpowder made of?

153
00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:26.823
74% potassium nitrate, 13% charcoal.

154
00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:29.034
-Okay.
-Damn.

155
00:14:29.118 --> 00:14:30.118
Impressive, man.

156
00:14:33.789 --> 00:14:34.956
I said eyes on me.

157
00:14:36.083 --> 00:14:37.792
Come on, Ronny.

158
00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:40.754
There you go, man. Sixty packages.

159
00:14:40.838 --> 00:14:42.172
That's only 55.

160
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:44.090
For real?

161
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:46.634
Close enough.

162
00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:48.887
The hell it is. I live on those.

163
00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:53.099
Sixty. Hey. Hey.

164
00:14:53.184 --> 00:14:56.061
You wanted the real thing, right?
That is it.

165
00:14:56.145 --> 00:14:58.897
That is folded over 70 times.
Carbon-treated steel.

166
00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:00.899
Take your damn hands off me.

167
00:15:01.525 --> 00:15:03.485
You better tell your boy
to learn how to count.

168
00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:05.153
The deal was for 60 bags.

169
00:15:05.237 --> 00:15:07.614
Yeah? Well, that's all we got.

170
00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:10.533
You don't like it,
you can go back to Bellevue.

171
00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:14.954
Get the gat on homeboy.

172
00:15:16.874 --> 00:15:18.208
I wanna test this shit out.

173
00:15:22.379 --> 00:15:25.757
Yo, what's gunpowder made of?

174
00:15:25.841 --> 00:15:26.841
Hold out your arm.

175
00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:28.176
Showtime.

176
00:15:30.846 --> 00:15:32.430
Hold out your arm.

177
00:15:35.684 --> 00:15:37.018
Get up.

178
00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:40.522
Put your arm there.
Now, it's your neck or arm, baby.

179
00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:42.023
You choose.

180
00:15:43.984 --> 00:15:45.318
Ronny, that's not a toy, bro.

181
00:15:45.402 --> 00:15:46.861
Mind your business, Evan.

182
00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:48.613
Come on, Ronny. This ain't funny.

183
00:15:57.206 --> 00:15:59.040
Oh, God! My fingers!

184
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:03.002
I think it works, huh, Ronny?

185
00:16:03.087 --> 00:16:05.797
-Cut my goddamn fingers off, man!
-You'll be all right.

186
00:16:06.674 --> 00:16:09.092
Hey, sweetheart,
why don't you head on home now?

187
00:16:09.176 --> 00:16:10.927
You're tripping, bro.

188
00:16:11.011 --> 00:16:13.138
You are done, homey. You're a dead fool.

189
00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:14.681
I don't know, Ronny.

190
00:16:14.765 --> 00:16:17.934
You're talking to a guy who buys
antipsychotic medication from you.

191
00:16:18.018 --> 00:16:21.104
I'm feeling a little unbalanced right now.

192
00:16:21.188 --> 00:16:24.190
Maybe the best way to get
the voices in my head to stop talking

193
00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:25.650
is to cut yours off.

194
00:16:25.734 --> 00:16:27.068
Do you think it would help?

195
00:16:28.696 --> 00:16:31.698
No. Don't fire. Don't shoot. It's cool.

196
00:16:31.782 --> 00:16:33.533
We're cool, man. We're cool. All right?

197
00:16:33.617 --> 00:16:37.162
Hey, dickhead. Grab my pills. Now.

198
00:16:37.246 --> 00:16:38.663
There you go.

199
00:16:39.248 --> 00:16:41.082
-You're crazy, man.
-If I was crazy,

200
00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:43.418
I'd have chopped you up
in little pieces a long time ago.

201
00:16:43.502 --> 00:16:44.752
Give me my pills.

202
00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:49.424
And you listen to me, Ronny.
I'm not crazy, okay?

203
00:16:49.508 --> 00:16:51.843
I'm just misunderstood. All right?

204
00:17:45.689 --> 00:17:47.232
-Help!
-Leona!

205
00:18:21.976 --> 00:18:26.271
NYPD picked up an Evan McCauley.
Drug deal gone south.

206
00:18:27.439 --> 00:18:29.440
Cops found a sword on him.

207
00:18:30.442 --> 00:18:32.527
Blade was made with a process

208
00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:35.863
hasn't been used since Edo Japan.

209
00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:37.156
<i>So?</i>

210
00:18:38.075 --> 00:18:40.118
He claims he forged it himself.

211
00:18:40.869 --> 00:18:42.787
<i>Another broker-turned-hipster blacksmith.</i>

212
00:18:43.706 --> 00:18:46.165
Oh, ye of little faith.
Are you seeing this, Nora?

213
00:18:47.209 --> 00:18:49.335
<i>-Treadway?</i>
-Precisely.

214
00:18:50.337 --> 00:18:53.631
<i>If we know, Bathurst knows.</i>

215
00:18:53.716 --> 00:18:54.882
Be careful.

216
00:18:55.884 --> 00:18:57.093
<i>Thanks, Mom.</i>

217
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.367
Tell us when you're done, sir.

218
00:19:21.452 --> 00:19:22.785
Can I get my phone call?

219
00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:26.080
Supposed to get a phone call.

220
00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:43.681
You're dressed way too nice
to be an NYPD detective, so...

221
00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.434
must be a doctor.

222
00:19:48.645 --> 00:19:50.021
Not a thing?

223
00:19:51.273 --> 00:19:53.316
No recognition at all?

224
00:19:55.944 --> 00:19:57.695
I think I should feel hurt.

225
00:20:00.741 --> 00:20:04.660
Do you remember... Syracuse?

226
00:20:04.745 --> 00:20:06.287
Syracuse.

227
00:20:06.372 --> 00:20:07.538
The siege.

228
00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:10.625
Second Punic War.

229
00:20:12.795 --> 00:20:13.878
Where we first met.

230
00:20:14.463 --> 00:20:17.215
Well, not quite the thrill ride
of the First Punic War,

231
00:20:17.299 --> 00:20:18.591
but sequels are tough, huh?

232
00:20:19.968 --> 00:20:21.302
You disappoint me.

233
00:20:21.387 --> 00:20:23.429
Well, join the club.

234
00:20:23.514 --> 00:20:24.597
I notice...

235
00:20:27.017 --> 00:20:28.017
you didn't sign it.

236
00:20:31.939 --> 00:20:33.022
Then again...

237
00:20:34.858 --> 00:20:36.943
craftsmanship like this...

238
00:20:38.404 --> 00:20:41.364
you didn't need to... did you?

239
00:20:41.448 --> 00:20:44.200
I made a sword. Is that a crime?

240
00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:47.995
Evan McCauley.

241
00:20:48.956 --> 00:20:52.083
Diagnosed with schizophrenia at 14...

242
00:20:53.001 --> 00:20:56.045
after carving the words "Look inside"

243
00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.257
into your chest with a box cutter.

244
00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:02.802
Electroshock proved unhelpful.

245
00:21:03.595 --> 00:21:04.595
But these...

246
00:21:06.223 --> 00:21:07.598
are not bad, eh?

247
00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:14.897
-Doctor, can I-- 
-Please. Go ahead.

248
00:21:18.485 --> 00:21:22.530
At 16, attempted suicide via car crash,

249
00:21:22.614 --> 00:21:26.159
necessitating the steel plate
in your skull.

250
00:21:26.869 --> 00:21:29.829
Spent the rest of your early life
bouncing around

251
00:21:29.913 --> 00:21:33.332
between psych hospitals and foster homes.

252
00:21:33.417 --> 00:21:35.460
Well, I only cut
a couple of his fingers off.

253
00:21:35.544 --> 00:21:38.546
I don't think I'm gonna need to plead
insanity on this one, am I, Doctor?

254
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:39.797
I'm curious.

255
00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:42.508
"Look inside."

256
00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:46.554
-Why those words?
-Why not?

257
00:22:12.414 --> 00:22:16.250
Which one of these... is yours?

258
00:22:17.586 --> 00:22:20.171
You can skip the-- 
whatever the hell this is

259
00:22:20.255 --> 00:22:21.964
because none of that is mine.

260
00:22:26.512 --> 00:22:28.179
You're not supposed to have that in here.

261
00:22:36.939 --> 00:22:38.189
What's going on here?

262
00:22:39.024 --> 00:22:40.191
Hey, Officer.

263
00:22:58.794 --> 00:23:00.878
Hey, what the hell is going on here?

264
00:23:07.469 --> 00:23:08.636
Pick it up.

265
00:23:09.471 --> 00:23:10.471
What?

266
00:23:11.765 --> 00:23:12.765
Pick it up.

267
00:23:18.772 --> 00:23:19.981
Paris.

268
00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:21.732
1794.

269
00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:24.860
The last meal of the Comte d'Anjou.

270
00:23:29.533 --> 00:23:30.825
A Bordeaux.

271
00:23:31.743 --> 00:23:33.619
Not a bad choice for a last meal.

272
00:23:35.205 --> 00:23:36.330
Was it yours?

273
00:23:38.625 --> 00:23:41.354
I wish I knew what you were talking about,
but I don't know what to tell-- 

274
00:23:41.378 --> 00:23:42.628
Jesus!

275
00:23:42.713 --> 00:23:44.964
Every time you say, "I don't know,"

276
00:23:45.757 --> 00:23:48.092
this trigger gets pulled.

277
00:23:52.889 --> 00:23:54.682
-Is it yours?
-I don't know-- 

278
00:23:54.766 --> 00:23:56.309
Are you out of your mind?

279
00:23:56.393 --> 00:23:58.873
-We're in a police station! Officer!
-The room is soundproof!

280
00:23:58.937 --> 00:24:00.438
They won't even hear it when I put

281
00:24:00.522 --> 00:24:04.275
250 grams of lead
through the back of your skull.

282
00:24:10.824 --> 00:24:12.533
-Is it yours?
-Yes.

283
00:24:12.618 --> 00:24:14.410
Okay, yes, it's mine. Are you happy?

284
00:24:14.494 --> 00:24:15.494
Jesus!

285
00:24:17.623 --> 00:24:20.416
Lying... won't help.

286
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.252
Look, I'm just a guy
who was at the wrong place

287
00:24:23.337 --> 00:24:25.379
at the wrong time. That's all.

288
00:24:25.464 --> 00:24:26.756
Last chance, Evan.

289
00:24:28.425 --> 00:24:32.053
Is... it... yours?

290
00:25:12.469 --> 00:25:14.387
There's the Treadway I know!

291
00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:26.107
Little trick I learned from you.

292
00:25:29.695 --> 00:25:31.195
Hello, old friend.

293
00:25:53.677 --> 00:25:54.844
Whoa!

294
00:25:58.724 --> 00:25:59.932
Get in!

295
00:26:13.321 --> 00:26:14.697
-Hold on.
-Shit!

296
00:26:34.259 --> 00:26:35.885
Go! Turn! Turn!

297
00:26:48.648 --> 00:26:49.648
Oh, shit!

298
00:26:52.569 --> 00:26:54.195
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

299
00:26:55.864 --> 00:26:56.864
Go! Go!

300
00:27:01.912 --> 00:27:02.912
Inside!

301
00:27:04.122 --> 00:27:06.499
-Hold tight.
-Oh, sh...

302
00:27:16.843 --> 00:27:17.843
Cover!

303
00:27:20.305 --> 00:27:21.806
What are you waiting for? Let's go!

304
00:27:22.516 --> 00:27:24.391
-Go the other way!
-Take the wheel.

305
00:27:24.476 --> 00:27:26.060
-What?
-Get out of the car!

306
00:27:26.144 --> 00:27:29.146
Yeah, sure. Retractable steering wheel.
No problem. That's perfectly normal.

307
00:27:32.442 --> 00:27:34.401
-Reverse.
-Shoot that son of a bitch.

308
00:27:41.326 --> 00:27:42.868
Move! Clear the street!

309
00:27:43.453 --> 00:27:44.703
Shoot the driver!

310
00:27:49.584 --> 00:27:50.876
Jesus Christ!

311
00:27:55.131 --> 00:27:56.257
Who are they?

312
00:28:01.388 --> 00:28:02.388
Relax, it's bulletproof.

313
00:28:06.142 --> 00:28:07.518
180 now!

314
00:28:24.828 --> 00:28:25.828
Don't stop.

315
00:29:10.582 --> 00:29:12.333
-Can I ask you a question?
-Yeah, sure.

316
00:29:12.417 --> 00:29:13.626
Who the hell are you?

317
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:15.169
I'm Nora Brightman.

318
00:29:15.253 --> 00:29:17.755
Okay. But who was that dude back there?

319
00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:20.090
Bathurst. You didn't recognize him?

320
00:29:20.175 --> 00:29:22.301
No, I didn't. But clearly you did.

321
00:29:22.385 --> 00:29:24.094
Well, you've known him a long time.

322
00:29:24.179 --> 00:29:27.431
I've never seen that man in my life.
Him, I think I'd remember.

323
00:29:27.515 --> 00:29:29.516
Well, not in this life, maybe.

324
00:29:29.601 --> 00:29:31.727
Maybe I bumped into him
during the Second Punic War?

325
00:29:31.811 --> 00:29:34.229
Or maybe it was the French Revolution.
I'm bad with dates.

326
00:29:34.314 --> 00:29:35.481
-You remember that?
-No.

327
00:29:35.565 --> 00:29:37.316
I don't remember the French Revolution.

328
00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.902
I figured it out. I see now. I get it.

329
00:29:39.986 --> 00:29:42.279
-You do?
-None of this is real.

330
00:29:42.364 --> 00:29:45.115
It's a psychotic break.
I'm gonna wake up in a hospital somewhere,

331
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.368
drooling all over myself,
strung out on lithium.

332
00:29:47.452 --> 00:29:49.012
Is that easier to believe than the idea

333
00:29:49.037 --> 00:29:51.205
that maybe destiny
has something more in store for you?

334
00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:54.667
Destiny? Where I come from,
we got bills to pay, rent to make.

335
00:29:54.751 --> 00:29:57.294
-Nobody's got time for destiny.
-That's a shame.

336
00:30:13.186 --> 00:30:15.562
I know you've been
looking for answers, Evan.

337
00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:17.940
You're not crazy. You never have been.

338
00:30:18.024 --> 00:30:20.943
No, I'm not crazy. I'm just delusional.

339
00:30:21.027 --> 00:30:23.529
Do you ever find yourself
drawn to places you've never been?

340
00:30:23.613 --> 00:30:26.333
Do you ever see a picture of a place
and just know you've been there?

341
00:30:26.408 --> 00:30:27.741
Do you know things you shouldn't?

342
00:30:27.826 --> 00:30:31.453
Do you pick things up fast,
almost as if you're remembering skills,

343
00:30:31.538 --> 00:30:32.621
not learning them?

344
00:30:32.706 --> 00:30:34.415
I've told a dozen therapists this.

345
00:30:34.499 --> 00:30:37.126
I've been analyzed every way possible,
a hundred times over.

346
00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:38.585
It doesn't mean anything.

347
00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.796
Do you dream in other languages?

348
00:30:44.634 --> 00:30:47.553
That's what schizophrenia is.
Different people, same head.

349
00:30:47.637 --> 00:30:51.098
Well, what if it was the same person,
different lives?

350
00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:53.434
-You're talking about reincarnation.
-Yeah.

351
00:30:54.185 --> 00:30:57.021
You can forge a sword
because you were a blacksmith.

352
00:30:57.105 --> 00:30:59.606
You speak Russian
because you were Russian.

353
00:30:59.691 --> 00:31:01.400
Look, I hate to break it to you.

354
00:31:01.484 --> 00:31:04.737
It's a comforting idea,
souls moving from one body to the next.

355
00:31:04.821 --> 00:31:08.323
But it's basically a spiritual equivalent
of "better luck next time." Okay?

356
00:31:08.408 --> 00:31:10.367
Nothing more and nothing less.

357
00:31:10.452 --> 00:31:12.286
Feel safe and warm
inside all that cynicism?

358
00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:14.515
-I do, actually.
-And how's that working out for you?

359
00:31:14.539 --> 00:31:17.499
What, in the grand scheme of things?
Like big-picture shit? Not so great.

360
00:31:17.584 --> 00:31:19.376
But I'm good. I'm surviving.

361
00:31:21.129 --> 00:31:25.174
The visions you've had your entire life,
Evan, aren't hallucinations.

362
00:31:25.258 --> 00:31:26.550
They're memories.

363
00:31:27.844 --> 00:31:30.554
So, you're saying
that a hundred doctors were wrong?

364
00:31:30.638 --> 00:31:31.889
Fifty medications didn't work

365
00:31:31.973 --> 00:31:35.100
because I'm really
a reincarnated Russian blacksmith?

366
00:31:35.685 --> 00:31:36.685
This is real.

367
00:31:37.979 --> 00:31:40.105
I'm real.

368
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:43.525
Oh, yeah? Well, this is no version
of reincarnation I've ever heard of.

369
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:44.985
Buddhist, Hindu, Sikh.

370
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:47.154
They believe each life begins
with a clean slate.

371
00:31:47.906 --> 00:31:50.491
The answers you've been
looking for all your life...

372
00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:53.702
all you gotta do is get on that plane.

373
00:31:57.415 --> 00:31:59.750
You know what I'm really
asking myself right now is?

374
00:32:00.877 --> 00:32:03.879
What if the craziest thing I've heard-- 
and this is some crazy shit-- 

375
00:32:03.963 --> 00:32:06.443
Is actually the first thing
that's ever made any goddamn sense?

376
00:32:09.469 --> 00:32:13.305
I don't gotta go feed the cat, so...
let's go.

377
00:32:40.917 --> 00:32:41.917
Go on.

378
00:33:03.606 --> 00:33:05.315
They left from a private airport.

379
00:33:05.984 --> 00:33:07.651
It was an unlisted flight.

380
00:33:09.654 --> 00:33:10.863
She was there fast.

381
00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:13.490
Too fast.

382
00:33:14.701 --> 00:33:17.578
The sword hadn't been in the system
for more than a few hours.

383
00:33:18.413 --> 00:33:20.914
-Then they have a base here in New York.
-I want it found.

384
00:33:21.583 --> 00:33:23.500
It will lead us to Evan McCauley.

385
00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:25.711
He will lead us to the Egg.

386
00:33:26.379 --> 00:33:27.462
Again.

387
00:33:48.484 --> 00:33:50.611
We call ourselves the Infinite.

388
00:33:50.695 --> 00:33:53.363
Less than 500 souls from across the globe,

389
00:33:53.448 --> 00:33:57.618
all born with the ability
to remember all our past lives

390
00:33:57.702 --> 00:33:59.462
and the skills we've learned
in each of them.

391
00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:02.372
There are two groups within the Infinites,

392
00:34:02.457 --> 00:34:07.002
Bathurst and the Nihilists,
who just want the world to end,

393
00:34:07.086 --> 00:34:09.421
and us... the Believers.

394
00:34:10.215 --> 00:34:11.965
And what is it that we believe?

395
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:15.093
We believe that our gift
is a responsibility.

396
00:34:16.012 --> 00:34:19.973
That it's up to us to leave humanity
better off than we found it.

397
00:34:20.058 --> 00:34:21.058
Yeah?

398
00:34:22.352 --> 00:34:24.144
I think I'm gonna need these.

399
00:34:57.345 --> 00:34:59.596
-Hey.
-Hey.

400
00:34:59.681 --> 00:35:00.681
Thanks.

401
00:35:03.059 --> 00:35:05.018
It's a long way from Arthur Avenue.

402
00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:08.647
It always blows my mind.

403
00:35:09.816 --> 00:35:11.817
We call it the Hub.

404
00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:19.548
This is the place where you're gonna get
your memories back, Evan.

405
00:35:22.203 --> 00:35:23.495
We'll be landing soon.

406
00:35:39.095 --> 00:35:42.472
-Recognize anything?
-I'm pretty sure I'd remember this.

407
00:35:43.391 --> 00:35:45.767
It used to be dedicated
to scientific research.

408
00:35:45.852 --> 00:35:48.186
Anthropology and linguistics.

409
00:35:48.271 --> 00:35:50.439
All of us using what we've learned.

410
00:35:50.523 --> 00:35:53.650
Life after life
for the advancement of mankind.

411
00:35:53.735 --> 00:35:54.943
And what is it now?

412
00:35:56.237 --> 00:35:58.488
Headquarters for the losing side
in the war.

413
00:36:03.703 --> 00:36:05.871
Bathurst is the master of combat.

414
00:36:05.955 --> 00:36:07.331
Hundreds of lifetimes.

415
00:36:16.174 --> 00:36:18.050
You must be prepared for everything.

416
00:36:26.601 --> 00:36:28.352
He's the apex predator in our world.

417
00:36:31.564 --> 00:36:32.564
Again.

418
00:36:41.699 --> 00:36:42.699
Why are they bowing?

419
00:36:43.534 --> 00:36:45.786
They're hoping you're Heinrich Treadway.

420
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.829
-Again!
-Reincarnated.

421
00:36:47.914 --> 00:36:48.914
Heinrich?

422
00:36:49.874 --> 00:36:51.917
It was a popular name in the '50s.

423
00:36:52.001 --> 00:36:53.460
In the '50s.

424
00:36:53.544 --> 00:36:56.797
Great for rock 'n' roll,
but lousy for names, I guess.

425
00:36:56.881 --> 00:36:59.174
The 1750s.

426
00:37:02.345 --> 00:37:04.179
What do I know that you need so bad?

427
00:37:04.972 --> 00:37:07.599
That's why you're here, to find out.

428
00:37:31.082 --> 00:37:34.251
-This is Treadway's room.
-Are you asking me or telling me?

429
00:37:35.378 --> 00:37:38.672
I must've really screwed up
on my last incarnation.

430
00:37:38.756 --> 00:37:39.756
Why would you say that?

431
00:37:40.758 --> 00:37:42.843
Have you seen where I live in this life?

432
00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:51.768
That's Treadway's Himalaya diary.

433
00:37:55.731 --> 00:37:57.315
That was me.

434
00:37:58.443 --> 00:37:59.985
When I was Leona Warrick.

435
00:38:01.446 --> 00:38:03.822
And that was Treadway.

436
00:38:11.664 --> 00:38:13.665
Two days after that picture was taken,

437
00:38:13.749 --> 00:38:15.250
Treadway saved my life.

438
00:38:16.752 --> 00:38:19.421
There's a reason you picked that book.

439
00:38:20.465 --> 00:38:22.090
All this tells me is what he did.

440
00:38:23.092 --> 00:38:24.968
None of it tells me who he was.

441
00:38:25.887 --> 00:38:27.888
Here we can study anything and everything.

442
00:38:27.972 --> 00:38:31.099
Space, time, scale. It's all relevant.

443
00:38:32.226 --> 00:38:34.311
That doesn't seem like much.

444
00:38:34.395 --> 00:38:36.521
Welcome to my virtual sandbox.

445
00:38:36.606 --> 00:38:38.857
-Name's Garrick.
-Hi.

446
00:38:38.941 --> 00:38:40.984
Garrick is our head
of technology and research.

447
00:38:41.068 --> 00:38:42.777
He doesn't look like much.

448
00:38:43.863 --> 00:38:45.906
Goddamn, it's good to see you again.

449
00:38:46.491 --> 00:38:48.617
It's nice to meet you, too.

450
00:38:48.701 --> 00:38:51.411
Don't worry.
All this shit, it just gets weirder.

451
00:38:52.038 --> 00:38:53.497
Okay.

452
00:38:53.581 --> 00:38:54.831
Now let's get started.

453
00:38:54.916 --> 00:38:55.916
Follow me.

454
00:38:59.545 --> 00:39:00.795
Stand there for me, please.

455
00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:02.839
Okay.

456
00:39:19.941 --> 00:39:21.501
That's the guy from the police station.

457
00:39:22.193 --> 00:39:25.153
Bathurst.
He and Treadway were once friends.

458
00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:28.698
A dozen lifetimes. Wars, peace.
They stood together

459
00:39:28.783 --> 00:39:31.076
at some of the greatest moments
in human history.

460
00:39:32.328 --> 00:39:34.162
Then Bathurst lost faith.

461
00:39:34.247 --> 00:39:38.250
For the last 300 years,
he's been looking for a way out.

462
00:39:38.334 --> 00:39:40.877
He needed a way to stop reincarnating.

463
00:39:40.962 --> 00:39:42.712
He wants it all to end.

464
00:39:42.797 --> 00:39:45.173
That's why he made this.

465
00:40:15.538 --> 00:40:16.538
<i>The Egg.</i>

466
00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:19.791
<i>Designed to kill
every living thing on Earth.</i>

467
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:22.294
<i>That seems a little drastic.</i>

468
00:40:23.337 --> 00:40:25.380
<i>If there's nothing left alive,</i>

469
00:40:25.464 --> 00:40:27.966
<i>there's nothing left to reincarnate into.</i>

470
00:40:30.803 --> 00:40:34.014
<i>It attacks life at the source, DNA...</i>

471
00:40:34.849 --> 00:40:37.642
<i>unwinding the very fabric of existence.</i>

472
00:40:38.311 --> 00:40:41.396
<i>Every plant, every animal, every person.</i>

473
00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.689
Mama!

474
00:40:42.773 --> 00:40:43.940
Jordan!

475
00:40:47.528 --> 00:40:48.820
I'm coming!

476
00:40:55.578 --> 00:40:59.289
<i>Like unplugging a computer
when a program freezes.</i>

477
00:40:59.373 --> 00:41:00.957
<i>Only when he pulls this plug,</i>

478
00:41:01.042 --> 00:41:03.251
<i>seven billion people will go with him.</i>

479
00:41:04.587 --> 00:41:07.547
<i>Everything it kills
accelerates the process.</i>

480
00:41:12.219 --> 00:41:15.930
God! Holy shit, that felt freaking real!

481
00:41:16.015 --> 00:41:18.892
Without you, none of us
would be here right now.

482
00:41:18.976 --> 00:41:20.310
What are you talking about?

483
00:41:20.394 --> 00:41:23.146
Last cycle, you raided Bathurst's lab,

484
00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:25.023
stole the Egg, killed his Einstein

485
00:41:25.107 --> 00:41:26.483
and everyone who helped build it,

486
00:41:26.567 --> 00:41:28.568
leaving him with no way to recreate it.

487
00:41:28.653 --> 00:41:31.988
You took the secret
of the Egg's whereabouts to your grave.

488
00:41:32.073 --> 00:41:35.116
Bathurst spent this entire lifetime
looking for it.

489
00:41:35.201 --> 00:41:38.203
And he's getting closer and closer
to finding it every day.

490
00:41:38.871 --> 00:41:40.705
That's why he tracked you down
in New York.

491
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:42.040
So I get on the plane,

492
00:41:42.124 --> 00:41:44.834
you get all my memories back
and I save the whole world. That's it?

493
00:41:44.919 --> 00:41:46.795
That's pretty much basically it, right?

494
00:41:46.879 --> 00:41:48.672
Told you it was gonna get weird.

495
00:41:48.756 --> 00:41:50.006
So, what now?

496
00:41:53.803 --> 00:41:55.428
Tell me good news, Nora.

497
00:41:55.513 --> 00:42:00.058
<i>Bryan Porter.
Treadway had a gift with steel, didn't he?</i>

498
00:42:00.142 --> 00:42:01.434
<i>Impeccable.</i>

499
00:42:01.519 --> 00:42:04.688
<i>Your friends in the NYPD
were certainly impressed with it.</i>

500
00:42:04.772 --> 00:42:08.608
<i>Unfortunately, their encryption skills
are less than impeccable.</i>

501
00:42:09.652 --> 00:42:10.819
<i>Led us right to you.</i>

502
00:42:21.997 --> 00:42:24.791
You do know we have easier ways
of doing things now, right?

503
00:42:25.793 --> 00:42:26.793
Newer...

504
00:42:28.045 --> 00:42:30.338
almost never means better.

505
00:42:39.807 --> 00:42:42.976
We're going to uncover
Evan McCauley's location.

506
00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:45.145
We'll brute-force your encryption.

507
00:42:46.689 --> 00:42:50.108
But I'd consider it... a courtesy...

508
00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:52.110
if you just...

509
00:42:53.779 --> 00:42:55.280
sped the process up.

510
00:42:58.993 --> 00:42:59.993
Tell us where he is.

511
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:10.670
Okay.

512
00:43:12.214 --> 00:43:13.423
I know where he is.

513
00:43:16.218 --> 00:43:17.218
Of course I do.

514
00:43:18.554 --> 00:43:21.806
I know exactly where he is. I just...

515
00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:26.936
I, um...

516
00:43:27.021 --> 00:43:32.734
I sometimes have difficulties...
with my memory.

517
00:43:32.818 --> 00:43:33.818
Memory.

518
00:43:33.903 --> 00:43:39.741
I remember when you used to gather honey
on the fields of Marathon.

519
00:43:41.744 --> 00:43:46.247
Just another reminder
of how nothing stays the same.

520
00:43:56.467 --> 00:43:57.801
Would you care for some?

521
00:44:03.224 --> 00:44:05.475
You know what real torture is?

522
00:44:05.559 --> 00:44:07.018
Listening to you?

523
00:44:07.728 --> 00:44:14.192
Real torture... isn't physical pain...
but human stupidity.

524
00:44:14.985 --> 00:44:18.905
Being surrounded by it, engulfed in it.

525
00:44:18.989 --> 00:44:21.366
Lifetime after lifetime.

526
00:44:22.326 --> 00:44:25.203
People with their idiot grins!

527
00:44:25.287 --> 00:44:27.956
Their infuriating pleasantries!

528
00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:29.958
Their need for approval!

529
00:44:30.042 --> 00:44:33.753
Their unctuous attempts
to be loved and validated!

530
00:44:33.838 --> 00:44:37.465
They are walking, talking obituaries

531
00:44:38.175 --> 00:44:40.677
on the back page of a dying newspaper,

532
00:44:40.761 --> 00:44:44.430
at the bottom of a birdcage,
in the corner of a filthy living room

533
00:44:44.515 --> 00:44:45.974
of a hoarder cat lady!

534
00:44:46.058 --> 00:44:48.685
-And we are forced...
-You'll never understand...

535
00:44:48.769 --> 00:44:51.855
-...to live amongst them over and over...
-...friendship, love...

536
00:44:51.939 --> 00:44:53.815
-...endlessly.
-...trust.

537
00:44:53.899 --> 00:44:57.485
-That is the true definition of torture.
-You still don't understand about faith!

538
00:44:57.570 --> 00:45:01.114
Faith! Blah, blah, blah!

539
00:45:01.198 --> 00:45:02.407
Faith!

540
00:45:03.325 --> 00:45:04.325
Faith.

541
00:45:06.245 --> 00:45:08.037
I'm tired of faith.

542
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:12.375
God must show me his face.

543
00:45:25.931 --> 00:45:29.225
But thank you... for enlightening me.

544
00:45:47.036 --> 00:45:49.162
You kept his fucking body?

545
00:45:49.246 --> 00:45:50.830
Sexy son of a bitch, isn't he?

546
00:45:50.915 --> 00:45:52.582
No. He's a dead guy floating in water.

547
00:45:52.666 --> 00:45:54.500
That's pretty much my worst nightmare.

548
00:45:54.585 --> 00:45:57.670
Actually, it's a crotonic acid matrix.
Keeps the cells alive.

549
00:45:57.755 --> 00:45:59.881
Oh. That makes it
that much better. Thank you.

550
00:45:59.965 --> 00:46:02.842
We're trying to understand
the science behind what we are.

551
00:46:10.142 --> 00:46:11.684
Treadway believed that humans

552
00:46:11.769 --> 00:46:14.646
are capable of so much more
than we realized.

553
00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:17.330
Is this what you're telling me?
I'm not living up to my potential?

554
00:46:17.399 --> 00:46:19.484
I've heard that speech before.

555
00:46:19.568 --> 00:46:21.235
Treadway pushed past boundaries

556
00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:23.863
others might call paranormal, superhuman.

557
00:46:23.948 --> 00:46:26.866
He can manipulate the energy
of the world around him.

558
00:46:26.951 --> 00:46:28.409
I don't even know what that means.

559
00:46:28.494 --> 00:46:30.370
What it means is you'll have skills

560
00:46:30.454 --> 00:46:32.956
beyond anything you've ever imagined.

561
00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:36.584
Those abilities are very deep.
Below the conscious level.

562
00:46:37.586 --> 00:46:40.046
I'm down. How do we get them back?

563
00:46:42.841 --> 00:46:45.259
<i>Here, we retrain your memory.</i>

564
00:46:45.344 --> 00:46:48.763
<i>We combine the physical and the mental
to develop new neural pathways.</i>

565
00:46:57.439 --> 00:46:59.273
<i>Memories are held in every organ...</i>

566
00:47:00.609 --> 00:47:02.026
<i>every cell in your body.</i>

567
00:47:11.078 --> 00:47:14.247
Regression takes the kind of concentration
it takes years to develop.

568
00:47:14.957 --> 00:47:16.207
This is a shortcut.

569
00:47:17.501 --> 00:47:20.670
We shock your mind
into syncing with the system.

570
00:47:52.578 --> 00:47:53.828
It's working.

571
00:47:53.912 --> 00:47:57.373
I'm seeing increased activity
in all his memory centers.

572
00:48:30.115 --> 00:48:31.115
Hey!

573
00:48:48.801 --> 00:48:49.801
Come on.

574
00:48:52.429 --> 00:48:54.722
-That's not Treadway.
-Really?

575
00:48:54.807 --> 00:48:56.307
He just beat you.

576
00:48:56.391 --> 00:48:58.351
Treadway would've killed me.

577
00:49:05.484 --> 00:49:06.692
Wow.

578
00:49:07.486 --> 00:49:09.487
She wasn't kidding
about being at war, huh?

579
00:49:10.197 --> 00:49:12.031
Improving the human condition.

580
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:16.285
Sometimes you do it
by painting a chapel ceiling...

581
00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:18.621
Yeah. And sometimes
you drop them from a mile out.

582
00:49:18.705 --> 00:49:20.623
Don't touch that.

583
00:49:20.707 --> 00:49:22.208
Okay, okay.

584
00:49:26.338 --> 00:49:28.464
That's no gun I've ever seen before.

585
00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:32.051
We're reverse-engineering
Bathurst's Dethroner.

586
00:49:32.636 --> 00:49:36.305
A Dethroner? I mean, dude,
who's coming up with these names?

587
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:37.390
Look...

588
00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:41.144
you can't kill an Infinite.
You kill the body, but...

589
00:49:41.228 --> 00:49:43.980
-They get reincarnated.
-Yeah.

590
00:49:45.232 --> 00:49:48.693
This implants in your head

591
00:49:48.777 --> 00:49:51.237
and pulls out your consciousness,

592
00:49:52.656 --> 00:49:55.449
your soul, and onto a digital chip.

593
00:49:55.534 --> 00:49:57.910
Your soul gets stuck on a disk
and breaks the cycle.

594
00:49:59.955 --> 00:50:05.001
Over 200 of our brothers and sisters
are lost in that digital purgatory.

595
00:50:06.837 --> 00:50:08.546
You come face to face with this,

596
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:12.508
my advice... find a way
to die the old-fashioned way.

597
00:50:17.264 --> 00:50:18.264
Come in.

598
00:50:22.394 --> 00:50:24.061
Okay if I look around?

599
00:50:24.146 --> 00:50:25.813
Be my guest.

600
00:50:45.375 --> 00:50:47.335
These are all you, aren't they?

601
00:50:48.545 --> 00:50:50.296
They're people I once was.

602
00:50:52.007 --> 00:50:53.007
All of them.

603
00:50:56.011 --> 00:50:59.680
Wow. That's cool. You look happy.

604
00:51:01.433 --> 00:51:02.433
I was.

605
00:51:04.102 --> 00:51:05.228
Who's that guy?

606
00:51:05.812 --> 00:51:08.356
In that picture, he was Abel.

607
00:51:09.608 --> 00:51:13.736
Before then, other names... other faces.

608
00:51:14.321 --> 00:51:15.321
But the soul...

609
00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:18.282
the soul was always him.

610
00:51:18.992 --> 00:51:21.619
So, what? You loved each other
through multiple lives?

611
00:51:22.704 --> 00:51:24.163
These are all the same place.

612
00:51:24.957 --> 00:51:28.000
Angkor Wat. What we call the Beginning.

613
00:51:30.128 --> 00:51:32.296
I'll find you in the Beginning.

614
00:51:33.257 --> 00:51:34.548
I love you.

615
00:51:34.633 --> 00:51:37.551
When each of us
would find ourselves in a new life,

616
00:51:38.428 --> 00:51:40.012
this is where Abel and I would go.

617
00:51:40.097 --> 00:51:42.390
You're reincarnated.
How would you know where to go?

618
00:51:43.642 --> 00:51:46.811
Most of us have a reawakening
that begins young.

619
00:51:47.521 --> 00:51:50.273
Starts with small things, memories,

620
00:51:50.357 --> 00:51:52.233
feelings about a place, dreams.

621
00:51:53.193 --> 00:51:56.946
By puberty...
most Infinites have full recall.

622
00:51:58.532 --> 00:52:00.908
Right around the time
they diagnosed me schizophrenic.

623
00:52:02.452 --> 00:52:04.537
So what happened
if you died young and got separated?

624
00:52:05.122 --> 00:52:06.122
For an Infinite...

625
00:52:07.499 --> 00:52:11.836
death isn't the end, it's like...
turning the page in a book.

626
00:52:12.754 --> 00:52:15.339
Next chapter, same story.

627
00:52:16.383 --> 00:52:17.383
That's crazy.

628
00:52:18.176 --> 00:52:21.178
New lives, new bodies,
always meeting back at the same place.

629
00:52:24.182 --> 00:52:25.182
He was Dethroned.

630
00:52:28.145 --> 00:52:29.854
He's trapped on a computer somewhere.

631
00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:34.900
My last life, I got my memories back...

632
00:52:36.695 --> 00:52:38.237
and realized he was gone.

633
00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:48.748
It's not my memories that matter, Evan.

634
00:52:50.667 --> 00:52:51.667
It's yours.

635
00:52:58.592 --> 00:53:01.177
Your last life, in Mexico,

636
00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:04.221
where did you hide the Egg?

637
00:53:26.411 --> 00:53:27.953
<i>Where's the Egg?</i>

638
00:53:37.631 --> 00:53:39.423
Where is it?

639
00:53:49.059 --> 00:53:50.259
-He's spiking.
-Shut it down.

640
00:53:54.439 --> 00:53:58.067
Hey, you're okay. You're okay.
Hey. Hey, just breathe.

641
00:53:58.151 --> 00:53:59.568
-I need to get up.
-Breathe.

642
00:53:59.653 --> 00:54:01.237
Kovic, check his vitals.

643
00:54:01.321 --> 00:54:03.364
What happened in there, Evan?
What did you see?

644
00:54:03.448 --> 00:54:06.242
Your neural network fired off
like the Fourth of July.

645
00:54:06.827 --> 00:54:09.472
I've been seeing this stuff all my life.
It still doesn't make any sense.

646
00:54:09.496 --> 00:54:10.913
Why can't he remember anything?

647
00:54:10.997 --> 00:54:12.677
Between the car accident, the electroshock

648
00:54:12.749 --> 00:54:15.835
and the steel plate in his head,
his mind is fractured.

649
00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:18.087
Something in there
won't let the memories flow.

650
00:54:18.171 --> 00:54:22.633
I can't get them out.
I'm afraid the Artisan is our last hope.

651
00:54:29.307 --> 00:54:31.392
He'll achieve recall soon.

652
00:54:33.478 --> 00:54:34.937
If he hasn't already.

653
00:54:43.655 --> 00:54:48.742
Hundreds of lifetimes,
and it all comes down to these few hours.

654
00:54:51.121 --> 00:54:53.122
If we don't find him...

655
00:54:55.333 --> 00:54:57.585
before he gets his memories back,

656
00:54:58.962 --> 00:55:00.296
we lose the Egg...

657
00:55:02.048 --> 00:55:03.174
forever.

658
00:55:05.343 --> 00:55:09.930
The wheels keep turning and we can never...

659
00:55:11.766 --> 00:55:13.017
escape.

660
00:55:17.772 --> 00:55:19.690
We go at dawn.

661
00:56:12.619 --> 00:56:14.870
It's been a while, Otto.

662
00:56:14.955 --> 00:56:19.667
No one's called me by that name in...
so many lifetimes.

663
00:56:28.885 --> 00:56:30.636
Hello, my love.

664
00:56:32.138 --> 00:56:33.138
What happened to you?

665
00:56:35.392 --> 00:56:37.643
You were so beautiful.

666
00:56:38.687 --> 00:56:40.062
As were you.

667
00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:42.356
You don't miss it?

668
00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:43.816
The agility...

669
00:56:45.026 --> 00:56:46.026
the vibrancy...

670
00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:48.821
being confined to this?

671
00:56:48.905 --> 00:56:51.865
You see me as something broken. I don't.

672
00:56:53.201 --> 00:56:55.661
You're the cripple, Otto.

673
00:56:55.745 --> 00:56:58.038
-Crippled by your cowardice.
-Cowardice?

674
00:56:58.123 --> 00:57:03.210
No. I'm crippled... by my memory.

675
00:57:03.295 --> 00:57:07.214
You get your memories back
over years. Not me.

676
00:57:07.299 --> 00:57:11.427
I get it all back as my brain forms.
In the womb.

677
00:57:11.511 --> 00:57:16.765
Endless hours, days, weeks, months.

678
00:57:16.850 --> 00:57:18.225
No room to move!

679
00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:22.980
Nothing for my brain to do but eat itself.

680
00:57:23.064 --> 00:57:26.775
All these lifetimes,
the magnitude of this gift,

681
00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:29.194
and you haven't learned a thing.

682
00:57:29.279 --> 00:57:30.738
I have to get out.

683
00:57:31.906 --> 00:57:33.449
I have to make it stop.

684
00:57:34.534 --> 00:57:38.037
Don't do it. Don't give him anything.

685
00:57:39.372 --> 00:57:40.748
Where is Treadway?

686
00:57:47.714 --> 00:57:49.214
We storming the beach at Normandy?

687
00:57:49.883 --> 00:57:51.759
You never know with the Artisan.

688
00:57:53.053 --> 00:57:54.053
Let's get ready.

689
00:58:29.839 --> 00:58:31.131
Color out, please.

690
00:58:34.719 --> 00:58:36.887
So, the Artisan's a gambler?

691
00:58:36.971 --> 00:58:38.514
No, he's a hedonist.

692
00:58:38.598 --> 00:58:41.850
Infinite lives,
infinite opportunity for debauchery.

693
00:58:41.935 --> 00:58:43.352
Sounds like my kinda guy.

694
00:59:37.615 --> 00:59:39.742
Alexa, music off.

695
00:59:40.326 --> 00:59:41.952
Get him cleaned up and outta here.

696
00:59:42.996 --> 00:59:44.997
You're operating on dead guys now?

697
00:59:45.081 --> 00:59:47.666
Da Vinci used to cut into human cadavers

698
00:59:47.751 --> 00:59:50.794
so that he could better understand
the human form.

699
00:59:50.879 --> 00:59:52.004
For me...

700
00:59:52.088 --> 00:59:54.131
I'm all about that brain, baby.

701
00:59:55.884 --> 00:59:58.469
But you know that all too well.

702
00:59:58.553 --> 01:00:03.307
Oh, what a beautiful cranial arch
you got this time around.

703
01:00:03.391 --> 01:00:07.603
I could better examine it
if I severed your head from your neck.

704
01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:09.897
Like Treadway did to me when last we met.

705
01:00:09.981 --> 01:00:11.815
-Try it.
-Oh.

706
01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.442
Bathurst took the Hub.

707
01:00:16.905 --> 01:00:19.072
-Does he have the Egg?
-No.

708
01:00:19.657 --> 01:00:21.116
Think we'd be here if he did?

709
01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:25.662
Wherever it is, it's still in his head.

710
01:00:27.957 --> 01:00:28.957
Treadway?

711
01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:30.709
So they say.

712
01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:34.505
Wait. Is he blocked?

713
01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:39.718
Well, well, well, look at this.

714
01:00:39.803 --> 01:00:40.803
Huh.

715
01:00:41.846 --> 01:00:45.432
So... your hard drive got fragged,

716
01:00:45.517 --> 01:00:48.727
which means we're gonna
have to reset your memory.

717
01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:53.524
And, Heinrich, I gotta tell ya,
I'm really gonna enjoy this.

718
01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:57.319
Check this out.

719
01:01:00.615 --> 01:01:03.492
You're all familiar with the idea
that when you die,

720
01:01:03.576 --> 01:01:05.953
your life flashes before your eyes, right?

721
01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:09.915
This machine enhances that experience,

722
01:01:09.999 --> 01:01:12.251
prolonging your sense of time,

723
01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:17.631
allowing you to restore
or reorder everything inside.

724
01:01:17.715 --> 01:01:19.842
This-- This right here

725
01:01:19.926 --> 01:01:24.137
is the closest you're gonna get
to a total mental reboot.

726
01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:26.908
Are you planning on trying to drown me?

727
01:01:26.975 --> 01:01:28.433
'Cause I got a thing about drowning.

728
01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:30.727
-Which is?
-I don't like it!

729
01:01:30.812 --> 01:01:33.647
What kind of success rate
is this guy working with anyway?

730
01:01:33.731 --> 01:01:36.358
Confidence is... high.

731
01:01:36.442 --> 01:01:38.443
Yeah, and so are you, obviously.

732
01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:41.029
Okay. Hey.

733
01:01:41.114 --> 01:01:43.615
I like you this time around.
You're actually funny.

734
01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:47.870
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you're usually kind of a jerk.

735
01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:49.663
-It's true.
-Yeah, she gets it.

736
01:01:49.747 --> 01:01:52.457
-So, I'm supposed to trust this guy?
-I wouldn't.

737
01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:55.127
First, I resent the gender labeling.

738
01:01:55.211 --> 01:01:58.505
Second, you can trust
that we share the same goal.

739
01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:00.007
Really? Which is?

740
01:02:00.091 --> 01:02:03.969
Bathurst wants to what,
destroy every living thing on Earth?

741
01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:05.220
Well, that's gonna ruin

742
01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:07.639
a pretty great party
I've got goin' on here.

743
01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:09.641
This guy's out of his mind. Hey-- 

744
01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:12.814
There's a reason
you didn't bring me here before.

745
01:02:13.855 --> 01:02:16.565
-I could die in there.
-Yeah.

746
01:02:18.067 --> 01:02:19.067
Could it work?

747
01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:22.404
It could.

748
01:02:24.073 --> 01:02:26.533
But you have a choice, Evan.

749
01:02:26.618 --> 01:02:28.660
No, I don't have a choice.

750
01:02:29.495 --> 01:02:33.415
I-- I can't let anybody else get hurt
because of what's in my head.

751
01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:45.344
All right. Leap-of-faith time.

752
01:02:46.888 --> 01:02:49.306
Let's just do it now
before I change my mind. All right?

753
01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:51.850
Let's go. Turn your machine on.

754
01:02:51.935 --> 01:02:53.602
Ooh. Ready to go for a swim?

755
01:02:53.686 --> 01:02:57.147
-Yes. This is gonna be so fun!
-Just shut up and turn it on.

756
01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:20.504
<i>...prolongs your sense of time.</i>

757
01:03:23.257 --> 01:03:26.134
Whatever happens,
don't let them stop until it's done.

758
01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:11.596
He'll hold his breath
as long as he can, and then...

759
01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:13.682
base instinct takes over.

760
01:04:30.241 --> 01:04:31.366
Twenty-two. Too many.

761
01:04:34.287 --> 01:04:35.912
Twenty. No more. And 18.

762
01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:56.183
Oh, my God. He's drowning.

763
01:04:56.768 --> 01:04:58.477
That's the whole idea.

764
01:05:02.607 --> 01:05:05.901
-Maybe we should pull him out.
-He's not there yet. Two more minutes.

765
01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:14.910
Abel, listen to me. If I fail...

766
01:05:19.832 --> 01:05:21.166
Come on.

767
01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:22.250
Nora...

768
01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:24.294
He's dying.

769
01:05:24.378 --> 01:05:26.379
We're close. We are close.

770
01:05:30.384 --> 01:05:32.052
Doesn't have a pulse!

771
01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:35.597
Get him out!

772
01:05:41.813 --> 01:05:42.813
Come on! Come on.

773
01:05:53.658 --> 01:05:55.117
Okay. Okay.

774
01:05:56.828 --> 01:05:58.120
Get out of the way.

775
01:06:02.708 --> 01:06:03.708
No!

776
01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:11.842
Come on.

777
01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:17.556
He's gone.

778
01:06:20.852 --> 01:06:22.185
We killed him.

779
01:06:46.294 --> 01:06:49.462
<i>If I fail, look inside.</i>

780
01:07:14.322 --> 01:07:16.406
Evan, you're okay. Just breathe.

781
01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:35.050
I am Treadway. I am Treadway.

782
01:07:45.353 --> 01:07:46.603
Hey. Whoa, whoa.

783
01:07:49.941 --> 01:07:50.941
I'm Treadway.

784
01:07:54.487 --> 01:07:57.822
If you are Treadway, answer this.

785
01:07:59.033 --> 01:08:00.867
Do you know where the Egg is?

786
01:08:21.305 --> 01:08:22.305
Yes.

787
01:08:22.974 --> 01:08:24.432
-Yes?
-Yes.

788
01:08:25.142 --> 01:08:27.769
Look inside. Look inside.

789
01:08:30.606 --> 01:08:33.066
We were trained to think of bodies
as unimportant, right?

790
01:08:33.150 --> 01:08:35.318
-Right.
-Just shells meant to be discarded.

791
01:08:36.153 --> 01:08:40.031
Well, Treadway knew the one place...
that nobody would look.

792
01:08:55.673 --> 01:08:57.924
Abel? Abel, listen to me.

793
01:08:58.009 --> 01:09:00.135
If I fail, look inside.

794
01:09:00.845 --> 01:09:02.178
It's in his body.

795
01:09:02.972 --> 01:09:04.055
Back at the Hub.

796
01:09:07.518 --> 01:09:09.644
It's been there the whole time. Come on.

797
01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:13.815
I am shocked that that worked.

798
01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:22.824
I knew it was you the whole time.
That's why I let you win.

799
01:09:22.908 --> 01:09:23.950
Oh, you let me, huh?

800
01:09:24.035 --> 01:09:27.537
Whoo! I don't know about you guys,
but I could use a drink.

801
01:09:27.621 --> 01:09:29.080
Come on, we don't have time for-- 

802
01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:31.791
Security lockdown!

803
01:09:36.172 --> 01:09:38.840
-I'm hit.
-You all right?

804
01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:47.015
Hey! Follow me.

805
01:09:47.099 --> 01:09:49.934
-Come on. We gotta go.
-Open emergency lift.

806
01:09:54.565 --> 01:09:55.982
-We gotta go. We gotta go.
-Wait!

807
01:09:56.067 --> 01:09:57.627
Are you crazy? They're about to breach!

808
01:09:57.651 --> 01:10:00.737
We're not running, all right?
I'm tired of running.

809
01:10:00.821 --> 01:10:03.239
-I'm gonna fight 'em right now.
-Hang in there, Trace.

810
01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:10.080
She's dead.

811
01:10:10.164 --> 01:10:11.456
Oh, sh...

812
01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:14.167
Guys, we need to leave now.

813
01:10:21.675 --> 01:10:23.676
-I'm staying.
-What?

814
01:10:23.761 --> 01:10:25.303
We stay here, we fight 'em now.

815
01:10:30.184 --> 01:10:32.727
-You're leaking like the Titanic.
-I'm fine.

816
01:10:32.812 --> 01:10:35.688
If you die here, who stops Bathurst?

817
01:10:36.399 --> 01:10:37.565
He's right.

818
01:10:38.484 --> 01:10:39.692
Hey.

819
01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:43.363
You make this worth it, dziecko.

820
01:10:44.365 --> 01:10:45.740
Then buy me some time.

821
01:10:47.159 --> 01:10:48.535
Open weapons room door.

822
01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:52.288
Good luck.

823
01:12:05.779 --> 01:12:06.779
Careful, sir.

824
01:12:08.491 --> 01:12:09.491
Oh, I will be.

825
01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:18.726
We're taking Treadway's body to Scotland.

826
01:13:18.811 --> 01:13:19.852
Very well.

827
01:13:21.689 --> 01:13:23.064
Keep him alive.

828
01:13:23.148 --> 01:13:26.484
I'll do the best I can,
but he's lost a lot of blood.

829
01:13:28.445 --> 01:13:29.779
The keys are in the car.

830
01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:54.429
Heinrich.

831
01:13:55.139 --> 01:13:57.181
Good of you to join us.

832
01:14:00.227 --> 01:14:02.937
I only wish you were here to see this...

833
01:14:04.356 --> 01:14:05.982
to understand your...

834
01:14:07.693 --> 01:14:09.819
your role in this.

835
01:14:16.577 --> 01:14:18.286
The end of all our debates.

836
01:14:45.856 --> 01:14:48.358
The end of all things.

837
01:14:52.529 --> 01:14:54.280
Have it cleaned and tested.

838
01:14:55.074 --> 01:14:57.158
Make sure it's the real thing.

839
01:14:57.743 --> 01:14:58.826
Is it really over?

840
01:14:59.662 --> 01:15:00.995
Not quite yet.

841
01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:04.082
Never underestimate Treadway.

842
01:15:32.403 --> 01:15:33.945
You're awake.

843
01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:35.113
Where am I?

844
01:15:35.906 --> 01:15:39.158
I told Nora I'd wait with you
until you woke up.

845
01:15:40.119 --> 01:15:42.120
You're in my safe house.

846
01:15:42.871 --> 01:15:46.249
-What are you doing?
-I'm doing your morphine!

847
01:15:47.459 --> 01:15:50.253
-Where is she?
-Huh? Oh, she went after Bathurst.

848
01:15:51.255 --> 01:15:52.630
Oh, shit.

849
01:15:52.715 --> 01:15:55.466
She's not doing this alone. No way.

850
01:15:57.428 --> 01:15:59.887
Whoa, whoa! Come on, man.

851
01:15:59.972 --> 01:16:03.641
You try running out now, you'll bleed out
before you reach the compound.

852
01:16:03.726 --> 01:16:06.436
If we're going down,
we're going down together.

853
01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:09.147
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

854
01:16:09.231 --> 01:16:11.274
I just patched you up, man.

855
01:16:12.317 --> 01:16:14.360
Let me catch you up
on the current situation.

856
01:16:15.112 --> 01:16:17.321
If Bathurst gets his way, we're all done.

857
01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:18.865
There's no more second chances.

858
01:16:19.575 --> 01:16:21.200
I'm gonna get the Egg and kill him.

859
01:16:22.619 --> 01:16:24.162
She told me you were one of us.

860
01:16:24.663 --> 01:16:26.330
Obviously, you're just full of shit.

861
01:16:28.542 --> 01:16:32.044
Diagnostics are done.
The bomb is ready for the Egg.

862
01:16:32.129 --> 01:16:33.755
Have them load it on the plane.

863
01:16:42.306 --> 01:16:44.140
Come here, you bastard.

864
01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:46.768
Do you think he'll...

865
01:16:48.228 --> 01:16:49.812
let us do this?

866
01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:52.940
No?

867
01:16:59.239 --> 01:17:01.073
The end of all things.

868
01:17:08.165 --> 01:17:09.165
Go.

869
01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:34.959
Move, move, move! On the rig! Let's go!

870
01:19:09.912 --> 01:19:11.120
Move, move!

871
01:20:37.082 --> 01:20:41.043
Dropping in three, two, one.

872
01:20:56.435 --> 01:20:57.893
-Do you need a ride?
-Love one.

873
01:20:59.479 --> 01:21:01.897
-You okay?
-No. Don't ask.

874
01:21:15.037 --> 01:21:16.287
Did you see that?

875
01:22:18.558 --> 01:22:20.392
Nora, you okay?

876
01:22:20.477 --> 01:22:21.560
Okay, come on.

877
01:22:22.604 --> 01:22:23.604
I got you.

878
01:22:29.069 --> 01:22:30.444
I'll get you out of here. Come on.

879
01:22:31.696 --> 01:22:32.696
Oh, shit.

880
01:22:36.451 --> 01:22:39.036
You all right? Oh, shit.

881
01:22:39.121 --> 01:22:41.038
Hey. We gotta get you out of here.

882
01:22:49.214 --> 01:22:51.799
-You gonna be okay to move?
-Yeah, I'll be fine.

883
01:22:51.883 --> 01:22:52.925
Okay. Come on.

884
01:23:32.799 --> 01:23:35.176
-You gotta go.
-Bathurst is getting away.

885
01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:38.262
His hard drives are here.
I have to destroy them and free them all.

886
01:23:39.514 --> 01:23:40.806
I'll see you again.

887
01:25:23.994 --> 01:25:26.745
We'll be landing in Glasgow
in 16 minutes, sir.

888
01:25:27.914 --> 01:25:28.914
Stay low.

889
01:25:30.792 --> 01:25:32.001
Use TFR.

890
01:25:35.797 --> 01:25:36.797
Oh, my God.

891
01:25:39.968 --> 01:25:42.052
Come on. Come on.

892
01:25:48.143 --> 01:25:49.351
They're all here.

893
01:25:50.353 --> 01:25:51.562
All the souls.

894
01:25:52.647 --> 01:25:53.897
We have to free them all.

895
01:25:57.527 --> 01:25:59.236
Nora. Nora, hey. Hey.

896
01:25:59.321 --> 01:26:02.406
Stay with me, okay? We are so close.

897
01:26:03.241 --> 01:26:05.367
Let's blow some shit up, huh?

898
01:26:27.349 --> 01:26:28.349
Shit!

899
01:26:29.392 --> 01:26:30.642
We've lost engine three, sir.

900
01:26:38.610 --> 01:26:40.130
We're gonna have to land the aircraft.

901
01:26:48.328 --> 01:26:50.454
What the hell are you doing? Sir!

902
01:26:58.171 --> 01:27:00.547
Please. You're gonna crash
the aircraft. Sir!

903
01:28:06.865 --> 01:28:08.866
It's impossible.

904
01:28:10.243 --> 01:28:11.994
I-Impossible.

905
01:28:23.673 --> 01:28:25.193
He's opened the bloody top hatch, sir.

906
01:29:17.227 --> 01:29:18.644
You disappoint me.

907
01:29:20.897 --> 01:29:22.814
No recognition whatsoever, huh?

908
01:29:23.858 --> 01:29:25.108
I think I should feel hurt.

909
01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:30.155
Car crash? Steel plate, remember?

910
01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:51.463
Treadway, you can't deactivate it!

911
01:31:52.632 --> 01:31:54.257
It's happening!

912
01:32:36.259 --> 01:32:38.009
No!

913
01:33:11.878 --> 01:33:14.421
<i>Death isn't the end. Not for us.</i>

914
01:33:15.006 --> 01:33:16.673
<i>Maybe not for any of us.</i>

915
01:33:16.758 --> 01:33:19.050
<i>New chapter, same story.</i>

916
01:33:20.970 --> 01:33:22.304
I can carry you out.

917
01:33:22.889 --> 01:33:24.139
No way.

918
01:33:24.724 --> 01:33:25.724
I'll free them.

919
01:33:27.351 --> 01:33:28.435
Here.

920
01:33:31.814 --> 01:33:33.690
-I'll see you around.
-Yeah.

921
01:33:46.913 --> 01:33:49.122
<i>I'll find you in the Beginning.</i>

922
01:33:49.207 --> 01:33:50.373
<i>I love you.</i>

923
01:34:08.768 --> 01:34:10.268
<i>I ask myself...</i>

924
01:34:11.354 --> 01:34:13.605
<i>what did being Evan McCauley teach me?</i>

925
01:34:20.321 --> 01:34:23.657
<i>If each new life is a chance
to build on what was,</i>

926
01:34:23.741 --> 01:34:26.618
<i>a chance to press forward
to the best of what could be...</i>

927
01:34:28.621 --> 01:34:29.621
Go, go, go!

928
01:34:30.498 --> 01:34:33.542
<i>...why will some of us have to pick up
the sword and fight again...</i>

929
01:34:47.431 --> 01:34:49.266
<i>while others discover a new beginning?</i>

930
01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:03.780
Nora?

931
01:35:12.582 --> 01:35:15.458
<i>It's hope. That's what I learned.</i>

932
01:35:15.543 --> 01:35:18.962
<i>Yes, we fall. Yes, we fail.</i>

933
01:35:19.046 --> 01:35:21.715
<i>Yes, sometimes we screw up
everything we touch.</i>

934
01:35:21.799 --> 01:35:24.426
<i>But each moment we live
is connected by a belief</i>

935
01:35:24.510 --> 01:35:29.764
<i>that the actions we take
will next day, next week, next life</i>

936
01:35:29.849 --> 01:35:31.641
<i>add up to something more,</i>

937
01:35:31.726 --> 01:35:33.935
<i>something bigger than yourself.</i>

938
01:35:50.494 --> 01:35:54.039
<i>And next... well, the possibilities are...</i>

939
01:35:55.041 --> 01:35:56.041
<i>infinite.</i>

940
01:37:07.697 --> 01:37:08.697
So...

941
01:37:09.573 --> 01:37:13.284
when your son starts asking questions
about his past,

942
01:37:13.369 --> 01:37:14.369
give me a call.

943
01:37:24.213 --> 01:37:26.339
{\an8}He says he's just a child.

944
01:37:26.924 --> 01:37:27.966
What about your sword?

945
01:37:29.552 --> 01:37:32.220
That's not my sword. It's his.

946
01:37:37.435 --> 01:37:39.936
Artisan, what took you so long?

947
01:37:40.855 --> 01:37:42.147
See you soon, Treadway.

948
01:46:10.747 --> 01:46:12.748
English
