-Okay.

00:33:04.712 --> 00:33:07.746
La Madrina isn't the only
family enterprise in town.

And to get to her?

426
00:33:09.817 --> 00:33:12.117
Well, they'll find
you two in your beds

427
00:33:12.219 --> 00:33:13.852

428
00:33:13.954 --> 00:33:16.254

What do you think?

445
00:34:44.878 --> 00:34:47.679
I think you've already
given her, like, five watches.

446
00:34:49.216 --> 00:34:51.349
Good point.

Where's Alberto?

00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:58.590
He should be on his way
to Medell n, no?

449
00:34:58.692 --> 00:35:00.425
He must be busy.

00:35:00.527 --> 00:35:03.361
Yes... of course.

the pleasure is all mine.

what I require

481
00:36:28.582 --> 00:36:32.017
is someone
who knows exactly what to do,

I even say it.

483
00:36:34.087 --> 00:36:36.254

00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:50.319
Oh, really?

739
00:53:50.421 --> 00:53:51.220
No.

740
00:53:51.322 --> 00:53:52.487
I beg to differ.

741
00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:54.056
Tell me what you want.

742
00:53:54.158 --> 00:53:56.058
Another car?

743
00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:57.459
No?

744
00:53:57.561 --> 00:53:59.127
Maybe...

745
00:53:59.230 --> 00:54:00.295
A horse?

746
00:54:00.397 --> 00:54:01.630
You love horses!

Anything! Anything.

748
00:54:04.068 --> 00:54:05.000
I'll get it.

00:54:05.102 --> 00:54:07.336
I just want you.

Congratulations.

00:56:15.367 --> 00:56:17.533
I overheard a nurse
talking about his penis.

00:56:36.488 --> 00:56:38.388
No, I love it.

Don't pout, Rodolfo.

00:57:23.868 --> 00:57:25.868
It was my idea.

795
00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:28.137
We're taking out
her enemies.

isn't that right, Michael?

811
00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:08.845
Tomorrow, we slit their throats

812
00:58:08.947 --> 00:58:11.914
and feed them
their own testicles.

00:58:13.818 --> 00:58:15.685

Susan!

926
01:04:46.842 --> 01:04:49.977
I saw a picture of her
in the paper.

927
01:04:50.079 --> 01:04:53.180
She married
some football player,

928
01:04:53.282 --> 01:04:55.782
already has
two little kids.

929
01:04:55.885 --> 01:05:00.254
They're so adorable,
I could have eaten them up.

930
01:05:00.356 --> 01:05:01.655
So cute!

Where'd you get that,

933
01:05:15.571 --> 01:05:16.737
by the way?

934
01:05:16.839 --> 01:05:18.538
It's very nice.

935
01:05:18.641 --> 01:05:20.874
I'm...

936

Oh, you know,
I'm here to collect, Tom.

937

Collect what?

938
01:05:24.213 --> 01:05:26.780
You owe La Madrina
380 grand.

What are you
talking about?

940
01:05:28.784 --> 01:05:30.484
She owes us.

941
01:05:30.586 --> 01:05:33.553
Could that be true?

942
01:05:33.656 --> 01:05:34.988
I don't know.
Maybe.

943
01:05:35.090 --> 01:05:37.190
If you could
just... Wait.

944

[Tom]: This is how she
takes care of her debts?

948
01:05:47.603 --> 01:05:49.970
You'll rot in hell
for this!

949
01:05:50.072 --> 01:05:51.571
It's nothing personal, Tom.

950
01:05:51.674 --> 01:05:54.141
We're just trying
to get the job done.

951

And brother,
she wants your head too.

No, no. Uber. Uber, no.
Y-You cannot cut my head off.

Please!

Can't you just shoot me?

955
01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:05.886
No, I can't
just shoot you.

956
01:06:05.988 --> 01:06:07.287
That'd make
too much noise.

957
01:06:07.389 --> 01:06:08.922
I got a silencer
in the car.

958
01:06:09.024 --> 01:06:10.958
Yes. Yes,
kill me with that.

959

Fine. We'll use--
We'll use a silencer.

01:06:16.632 --> 01:06:17.931
I mean, if my kids wake up
to me without a head--

Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa.
Your kids are here?

They're sleeping.

They-- They didn't
see anything.

965
01:06:23.572 --> 01:06:26.206
Tom! We're gonna have
to cancel them, too.

No. Please! No. Please!

967
01:06:27.977 --> 01:06:29.409
We're gonna have to talk
to Madrina

968
01:06:29.511 --> 01:06:30.677
before we do that.

969
01:06:30.779 --> 01:06:33.213
I'm gonna talk
to La Madrina first.

970
01:06:33.315 --> 01:06:37.551
Tom, I'm trying
to do you a favor here.

971
01:06:37.653 --> 01:06:39.920
See this crazy shit?

972
01:06:40.022 --> 01:06:42.689
You want your kids
to turn out like me?

973
01:06:42.791 --> 01:06:43.724
I don't think so.

Sorry, man.

to spare them.
