370
00:31:39.216 --> 00:31:40.084
-Get rid of him.
-He didn't talk.

371
00:31:40.186 --> 00:31:41.522
-He got caught.
-He's in jail.

372
00:31:41.624 --> 00:31:42.693
-Get rid of him!
-All right.

<i> Maybe I was too close.</i>

<i> They headed to Miami,</i>
<i> where business was booming,</i>

377
00:31:53.965 --> 00:31:58.311
<i> and all that competition</i>
<i>ignited her thirst for blood,</i>

<i> motorcycle assassins.</i>

00:32:09.383 --> 00:32:11.053
<i> Soon enough,</i>

382
00:32:11.156 --> 00:32:13.528
<i> every cartel in the city</i>
<i> wanted her dead.</i>

383
00:32:13.631 --> 00:32:16.538
<i> It was time</i>
<i> to step up security,</i>

384
00:32:16.641 --> 00:32:18.913
<i> and she demanded the best.</i>

385
00:32:21.255 --> 00:32:24.096
I hear you might be
looking for a job.

386
00:32:24.199 --> 00:32:26.070
I might.

387
00:32:26.172 --> 00:32:27.341
Unfortunately,

388
00:32:27.443 --> 00:32:29.682
my employers
seem to die a lot.

389
00:32:29.784 --> 00:32:31.187
Great.

390
00:32:31.289 --> 00:32:33.728
And you call yourself
head of security?

391
00:32:33.831 --> 00:32:35.167
I apologize.

392
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:37.207
They insisted
on coming.

393
00:32:37.309 --> 00:32:41.287
Mama's little
soldiers, huh?

394
00:32:41.389 --> 00:32:43.929
You got this, right?

395
00:32:44.031 --> 00:32:46.036
Don't need me.

396
00:32:46.138 --> 00:32:47.675
That's right.

397

This is just
a courtesy meeting.

398
00:32:49.249 --> 00:32:51.253
Okay, quiet.
I swear to god,

399
00:32:51.355 --> 00:32:52.357
if you say
another word--

400
00:32:52.459 --> 00:32:53.227
It's fine.
It's fine.

401
00:32:53.329 --> 00:32:55.902
Let them speak.
Really.

402
00:32:57.643 --> 00:33:00.785
Well, seeing as this is
a courtesy meeting--

403
00:33:00.888 --> 00:33:04.597
here's my two cents.

404
00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:07.742
La Madrina isn't the only
family enterprise in town.

405
00:33:07.844 --> 00:33:09.715
And to get to her?

406
00:33:09.817 --> 00:33:12.123
Well, they'll find
you two in your beds

407
00:33:12.225 --> 00:33:13.862
and cut your tongues out,

408
00:33:13.964 --> 00:33:16.269
and you'll never
see them coming.

409
00:33:19.984 --> 00:33:21.220
[chuckles]

410
00:33:22.526 --> 00:33:24.430
Let's go, turds.

411
00:33:24.533 --> 00:33:26.872
I hear you have
another brother.

412
00:33:37.877 --> 00:33:39.113
You see?

413
00:33:39.215 --> 00:33:41.922
Uber's not interested
in the family business.

414
00:33:42.024 --> 00:33:43.159
I mean, look at him.

415
00:33:43.261 --> 00:33:46.136
He wants
the blonde girlfriend

416
00:33:46.238 --> 00:33:49.915
and to be
Mr. All-American.

417
00:34:28.345 --> 00:34:30.784

420

Huh?

421
00:34:36.538 --> 00:34:37.439
Rudy's here.

422
00:34:37.541 --> 00:34:39.245
Oh.

423
00:34:40.551 --> 00:34:43.226
For Carolina's birthday
tomorrow.

424
00:34:43.328 --> 00:34:44.998
What do you think?

425
00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:47.908
I think you've already
given her, like, five watches.

426
00:34:49.448 --> 00:34:51.586
Good point.

427
00:34:54.498 --> 00:34:55.734
Where's Alberto?

428
00:34:55.836 --> 00:34:58.844
He should be on his way
to Medell n, no?

429
00:34:58.946 --> 00:35:00.683
He must be busy.

430
00:35:00.786 --> 00:35:03.626
Yes... of course.

431
00:35:03.729 --> 00:35:04.897
Those girls certainly

432
00:35:04.999 --> 00:35:06.268

their big-boobed chests

434
00:35:08.076 --> 00:35:10.817
now, can they?

435
00:35:10.919 --> 00:35:12.556
Mm?

436
00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.543
Madrina.

437
00:35:28.645 --> 00:35:31.084
I can truly say
the pleasure is all mine.

438
00:35:31.187 --> 00:35:33.526
Why, look at that.

439
00:35:33.628 --> 00:35:37.506
Already we agree
on something, Rodolfo.

440
00:35:37.608 --> 00:35:38.944
Rudy.

441
00:35:39.047 --> 00:35:41.385
I prefer Rodolfo.

442
00:35:41.488 --> 00:35:44.027
I have
a statistics final.

443
00:35:44.129 --> 00:35:45.265
Where is Susan,
my love?

444
00:35:45.367 --> 00:35:47.004
You always
study together.

445
00:35:47.106 --> 00:35:47.840
Susan?

446
00:35:47.942 --> 00:35:49.011
My girlfriend.

447

Home.

448
00:35:50.652 --> 00:35:51.887
Apparently she's been spending
a bit too much time

449
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:54.362
at the spic drug den.

450
00:35:54.464 --> 00:35:56.870
The "spic drug den"?

451
00:35:56.972 --> 00:35:58.543
Who says this?

452
00:35:58.645 --> 00:36:00.315
Probably her dad.

453
00:36:00.417 --> 00:36:01.686
He likes to run his mouth
after a few scotches.

454
00:36:01.788 --> 00:36:04.161
No big deal.
I gotta go study.

for a woman before, Rodolfo?

00:36:20.116 --> 00:36:22.288
Well, with all due respect...

458
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:24.495
no one has.

459
00:36:24.597 --> 00:36:27.372
What I need,

460
00:36:27.474 --> 00:36:28.944
what I require

461
00:36:29.046 --> 00:36:32.489
is someone
who knows exactly what to do,

462
00:36:32.591 --> 00:36:34.461
before
I even say it.

463
00:36:34.564 --> 00:36:36.736
Then what you need is me.

464
00:36:36.838 --> 00:36:38.676
Good.

465
00:36:38.778 --> 00:36:41.686

That slut's father.

Maybe this is not the best time
for personal business.

Nobody insults
this family.

Nobody.

still standing there? Huh?

923
01:05:35.182 --> 01:05:36.517
I don't know.
Maybe.

924
01:05:36.619 --> 01:05:38.724
If you could
just... Wait.

925
01:05:38.827 --> 01:05:41.300
I could show you
the bank statements that--

926
01:05:41.402 --> 01:05:43.540
[gasps intensely]

927
01:05:44.813 --> 01:05:46.282
What the hell,
man?

928
01:05:46.385 --> 01:05:49.059
[Tom]: This is how she
takes care of her debts?

929
01:05:49.161 --> 01:05:51.534
You'll rot in hell
for this!

930
01:05:51.636 --> 01:05:53.138
It's nothing personal, Tom.

931
01:05:53.242 --> 01:05:55.714
We're just trying
to get the job done.

932
01:05:57.321 --> 01:05:59.627
And brother,
she wants your head too.

933
01:05:59.730 --> 01:06:03.273
No, no. Uber. Uber, no.
Y-You cannot cut my head off.

934
01:06:03.375 --> 01:06:04.376
Please!

935
01:06:04.479 --> 01:06:05.915
Can't you just shoot me?

936
01:06:06.017 --> 01:06:07.487
No, I can't
just shoot you.

937
01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:08.891
That'd make
too much noise.

938
01:06:08.993 --> 01:06:10.530
I got a silencer
in the car.

939
01:06:10.632 --> 01:06:12.570
Yes. Yes,
kill me with that.

940
01:06:13.809 --> 01:06:16.617
Fine. We'll use--
We'll use a silencer.

941
01:06:16.719 --> 01:06:18.155
Thank you.

942
01:06:18.258 --> 01:06:19.560
I mean, if my kids wake up
to me without a head--

943
01:06:19.662 --> 01:06:22.102
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa.
Your kids are here?

944
01:06:22.204 --> 01:06:23.540
[Tom]:
They're sleeping.

945
01:06:23.642 --> 01:06:25.112
They-- They didn't
see anything.

946
01:06:25.214 --> 01:06:27.854
Tom! We're gonna have
to cancel them, too.

947
01:06:27.956 --> 01:06:29.526
No. Please! No. Please!

948
01:06:29.629 --> 01:06:31.065
We're gonna have to talk
to Madrina

949
01:06:31.167 --> 01:06:32.335
before we do that.

950
01:06:32.438 --> 01:06:34.877
I'm gonna talk
to La Madrina first.

951
01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:39.225
Tom, I'm trying
to do you a favor here.

952
01:06:39.328 --> 01:06:41.600
See this crazy shit?

953
01:06:41.702 --> 01:06:44.375
You want your kids
to turn out like me?

954
01:06:44.478 --> 01:06:45.413
I don't think so.

955
01:06:45.515 --> 01:06:46.784
Here.

956
01:06:48.793 --> 01:06:50.095
Sorry, man.

957
01:06:56.618 --> 01:07:00.563
He's got kids upstairs
that are asleep.

958
01:07:00.665 --> 01:07:02.368
And?

959
01:07:03.475 --> 01:07:05.078
Well, he wants us
to spare them.

960
01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:07.252
Oh.

961
01:07:11.535 --> 01:07:13.472
What would you do?

962
01:07:16.317 --> 01:07:18.656
I guess...

963
01:07:18.758 --> 01:07:20.395
I mean,
they're just kids.

964
01:07:21.735 --> 01:07:24.008
Yeah.

965
01:07:26.049 --> 01:07:29.525
Do you know
what my favorite thing is

966
01:07:29.628 --> 01:07:31.733
in<i>  Godfather II?</i>

967
01:07:34.143 --> 01:07:37.920
"Don't even leave a seed."

968
01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:40.362
Remember that?

969
01:07:40.464 --> 01:07:42.636
Yeah, I think so.

970
01:07:42.738 --> 01:07:44.542
Vito,

971
01:07:44.645 --> 01:07:47.117
he watches his mom
get killed by, uh...

Don Ciccio,

973
01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:49.425
when he was a boy?

974
01:07:49.527 --> 01:07:53.272
Yes, and Vito escapes,
remember?

975
01:07:53.374 --> 01:07:56.548
And when he becomes a man,
he...

976
01:07:56.652 --> 01:07:58.455
He stabs Don Ciccio.

977
01:07:58.557 --> 01:07:59.660
Yeah.

978
01:07:59.762 --> 01:08:03.003
And he looks him in the eye
and he tells him that.

979
01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:07.619
"Don't even

980
01:08:07.721 --> 01:08:09.526

I'm so very proud of you.

991
01:09:46.884 --> 01:09:48.521
Thank you, Mama.

992
01:09:48.623 --> 01:09:51.966
Now you have Jesus
inside of you,

993
01:09:52.068 --> 01:09:54.541
and He will protect you,

994
01:09:54.643 --> 01:09:56.782
just like He protects me.

995
01:09:56.884 --> 01:09:59.089
Yes. Amen.

nuts again, huh?

she's Al Capone.

What do you need, Dario?

1011
01:10:49.158 --> 01:10:51.363
To be done!

1012
01:10:51.465 --> 01:10:53.202
I did my job.

1013
01:10:53.305 --> 01:10:56.079
There's no controlling her
anymore.

1014

I'm afraid
that's not possible.

1015
01:10:59.894 --> 01:11:03.102
She moves
too much product.

1016
01:11:03.205 --> 01:11:04.807
She's indispensable.

1017
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:06.580
She murdered
two kids, Pablo.

1018
01:11:06.683 --> 01:11:09.055
Which is unfortunate.

to be gone.

You're like a brother to me,
Dario.

I would do anything for you,

but not this.

1023
01:11:26.415 --> 01:11:27.617
I would not
be running for Congress

without her, hmm?

1025
01:11:34.541 --> 01:11:37.249
Just keep
doing your job.
