1
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.539
Lydia! Kitty!

2
00:03:00.033 --> 00:03:02.819
My dear Mr Bennet, have you heard?

3
00:03:02.994 --> 00:03:07.702
Netherfield Park is let at last. Do you
not want to know who has taken it?

4
00:03:07.914 --> 00:03:13.916
As you wish to tell me, my dear,
I doubt I have any choice in the matter.

5
00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:22.799
Kitty, what have I told you
about listening at the door?

6
00:03:23.011 --> 00:03:25.797
There's a Mr Bingley
arrived from the North.

7
00:03:25.971 --> 00:03:29.221
- Five thousand a year!
- Really?

8
00:03:29.391 --> 00:03:31.015
- He's single!
- Who's single?

9
00:03:31.226 --> 00:03:33.895
A Mr Bingley, apparently. Kitty!

10
00:03:34.062 --> 00:03:35.936
How can that possibly affect them?

11
00:03:36.147 --> 00:03:38.269
Mr Bennet, how can
you be so tiresome?

12
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.812
You know he must marry one of them.

13
00:03:40.984 --> 00:03:43.023
That is his design in settling here?

14
00:03:43.236 --> 00:03:45.442
You must go and visit him at once.

15
00:03:45.655 --> 00:03:48.572
Good heavens. People.

16
00:03:51.034 --> 00:03:55.114
For we may not visit if you do not,
as you well know, Mr Bennet.

17
00:03:55.288 --> 00:03:59.499
- Are you listening? You never listen.
- You must, Papa! At once!

18
00:03:59.667 --> 00:04:02.204
There's no need. I already have.

19
00:04:02.961 --> 00:04:04.835
- You have?
- When?

20
00:04:05.005 --> 00:04:08.587
Oh, Mr Bennet,
how can you tease me so?

21
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.171
Have you no compassion
for my poor nerves?

22
00:04:11.385 --> 00:04:14.967
You mistake me, my dear.
I have the highest respect for them.

23
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.430
They've been my constant
companions these twenty years.

24
00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:19.595
Papa!

25
00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:21.054
- Is he amiable?
- Who?

26
00:04:21.227 --> 00:04:23.599
- Is he handsome?
- He's sure to be.

27
00:04:23.812 --> 00:04:26.978
With 5,000 a year, it would
not matter if he had warts.

28
00:04:27.148 --> 00:04:28.524
Who's got warts?

29
00:04:28.691 --> 00:04:31.941
I will consent to his marrying
whichever girl he chooses.

30
00:04:32.153 --> 00:04:36.364
- So will he come to the ball tomorrow?
- I believe so.

31
00:04:37.616 --> 00:04:41.447
- Mr Bennet!
- I have to have your muslin!

32
00:04:41.619 --> 00:04:44.454
- I'll lend you my green slippers!
- They were mine.

33
00:04:44.622 --> 00:04:48.370
- I'll do your mending for a week.
- I'll retrim your new bonnet.

34
00:04:48.583 --> 00:04:50.291
Two weeks I'll do it for.

35
00:05:28.701 --> 00:05:31.867
It's not the same!
It's not the same.

36
00:05:41.962 --> 00:05:43.919
I can't breathe.

37
00:05:46.758 --> 00:05:49.462
I think one of my
toes just came off.

38
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.601
If every man does not end
the evening in love with you,

39
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.561
then I'm no judge of beauty.

40
00:06:02.771 --> 00:06:05.772
- Or men.
- No, they are far too easy to judge.

41
00:06:05.941 --> 00:06:07.483
They're not all bad.

42
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.521
Humourless poppycocks,
in my limited experience.

43
00:06:10.695 --> 00:06:12.983
One day, someone
will catch your eye,

44
00:06:13.197 --> 00:06:15.569
and then you'll have
to watch your tongue.

45
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.045
How good of you to come.

46
00:06:38.218 --> 00:06:40.887
Which of the painted
peacocks is our Mr Bingley?

47
00:06:41.054 --> 00:06:43.805
He's on the right.
On the left is his sister.

48
00:06:43.973 --> 00:06:49.014
- The person with the quizzical brow?
- That is his good friend, Mr Darcy.

49
00:06:49.227 --> 00:06:53.604
- He looks miserable, poor soul.
- He may be, but poor he is not.

50
00:06:53.773 --> 00:06:54.769
Tell me.

51
00:06:54.982 --> 00:06:57.734
10,000 a year, and he
owns half of Derbyshire.

52
00:06:57.902 --> 00:06:59.941
The miserable half.

53
00:07:27.343 --> 00:07:32.218
Mr Bennet, you must introduce
him to the girls immediately.

54
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.931
Smile at Mr Bingley. Smile.

55
00:07:51.489 --> 00:07:52.484
Mary.

56
00:07:52.698 --> 00:07:55.615
Mr Bingley, my eldest daughter you know.

57
00:07:56.743 --> 00:08:01.203
Mrs Bennet, Miss Jane Bennet,
Elizabeth and Miss Mary Bennet.

58
00:08:01.372 --> 00:08:05.120
It is a pleasure. I have two others,
but they're already dancing.

59
00:08:05.292 --> 00:08:07.664
I'm delighted to make your acquaintance.

60
00:08:07.878 --> 00:08:13.168
And may I introduce Mr Darcy
of Pemberley in Derbyshire.

61
00:08:32.815 --> 00:08:35.022
How do you like it
here in Hertfordshire?

62
00:08:35.234 --> 00:08:37.191
Very much.

63
00:08:37.361 --> 00:08:40.694
The library at Netherfield,
I've heard, is one of the finest.

64
00:08:40.864 --> 00:08:45.324
It fills me with guilt. I'm not a good
reader. I prefer being out of doors.

65
00:08:45.535 --> 00:08:48.072
Oh, I mean, I can read, of course.

66
00:08:48.287 --> 00:08:51.702
And I'm not suggesting
you can't read out of doors.

67
00:08:51.873 --> 00:08:55.621
I wish I read more, but there
seem to be so many other things to do.

68
00:08:55.793 --> 00:08:58.082
That's exactly what I meant.

69
00:09:01.215 --> 00:09:05.128
Mama, Mama! You will never, ever
believe what we're about to tell you.

70
00:09:05.301 --> 00:09:07.922
- Tell me!
- She's going to take the veil.

71
00:09:08.095 --> 00:09:10.467
- The regiment are coming!
- Officers?

72
00:09:10.639 --> 00:09:13.889
They're going to be stationed
the whole winter, right here.

73
00:09:14.059 --> 00:09:16.596
- Officers?
- As far as the eye can see.

74
00:09:23.067 --> 00:09:26.980
Oh, look. Jane's dancing
with Mr Bingley.

75
00:09:27.153 --> 00:09:28.647
Mr Bennet.

76
00:09:42.833 --> 00:09:46.913
- Do you dance, Mr Darcy?
- Not if I can help it.

77
00:10:05.811 --> 00:10:08.895
I didn't know you were coming
to see me. What's the matter?

78
00:10:09.106 --> 00:10:14.775
We are a long way from Grosvenor
Square, are we not, Mr Darcy?

79
00:10:14.944 --> 00:10:17.150
I've never seen so many pretty girls.

80
00:10:17.363 --> 00:10:19.818
You were dancing with
the only handsome girl.

81
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:22.990
She is the most beautiful
creature I have ever beheld.

82
00:10:23.159 --> 00:10:27.536
- But her sister Elizabeth is agreeable.
- Perfectly tolerable.

83
00:10:27.705 --> 00:10:31.998
Not handsome enough to tempt me.
Return to your partner and enjoy her smiles.

84
00:10:32.167 --> 00:10:34.622
You're wasting your time with me.

85
00:10:38.589 --> 00:10:43.131
Count your blessings, Lizzie. If he
liked you, you'd have to talk to him.

86
00:10:43.343 --> 00:10:44.588
Precisely.

87
00:10:44.803 --> 00:10:47.507
I wouldn't dance with
him for all of Derbyshire,

88
00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.052
let alone the miserable half.

89
00:11:52.694 --> 00:11:54.152
Wait!

90
00:12:11.084 --> 00:12:16.588
- I enjoyed that so much, Miss Lucas.
- How well you dance, Mr Bingley.

91
00:12:16.756 --> 00:12:19.044
I've never enjoyed a dance so much.

92
00:12:19.258 --> 00:12:22.093
My daughter Jane is a
splendid dancer, is she not?

93
00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.217
She is indeed.

94
00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.429
Your friend Miss Lucas is a
most amusing young woman.

95
00:12:28.599 --> 00:12:30.307
Oh, yes, I adore her.

96
00:12:30.476 --> 00:12:34.639
- It is a pity she's not more handsome.
- Mama!

97
00:12:34.813 --> 00:12:38.312
Oh, but Lizzie would never
admit that she's plain.

98
00:12:38.483 --> 00:12:42.729
Of course, it's my Jane who's
considered the beauty of the county.

99
00:12:42.903 --> 00:12:43.899
Mama, please!

100
00:12:44.112 --> 00:12:47.196
When she was 15, a gentleman
was so much in love with her,

101
00:12:47.365 --> 00:12:49.571
I was sure he would make her an offer.

102
00:12:49.742 --> 00:12:53.324
However, he did write her
some very pretty verses.

103
00:12:53.495 --> 00:12:54.740
And that put paid to it.

104
00:12:54.913 --> 00:12:58.329
I wonder who discovered the power
of poetry in driving away love.

105
00:12:58.541 --> 00:13:01.874
- I thought poetry was the food of love.
- Of a fine, stout love.

106
00:13:02.044 --> 00:13:05.543
But if it is only a vague inclination,
one poor sonnet will kill it.

107
00:13:05.756 --> 00:13:08.756
So, what do you recommend
to encourage affection?

108
00:13:09.717 --> 00:13:15.719
Dancing. Even if one's
partner is barely tolerable.

109
00:13:38.158 --> 00:13:41.657
Mr Bingley is just what
a young man ought to be.

110
00:13:41.828 --> 00:13:45.327
- Sensible, good-humoured...
- Handsome, conveniently rich...

111
00:13:45.498 --> 00:13:48.333
Marriage should not be
driven by thoughts of money.

112
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.706
Only deep love will
persuade me to marry.

113
00:13:50.919 --> 00:13:55.545
- Which is why I'll end up an old maid.
- Do you really believe he liked me?

114
00:13:55.715 --> 00:13:59.214
He danced with you most of the night,
and stared at you the rest.

115
00:13:59.385 --> 00:14:02.385
I give you leave to like him.
You've liked many stupider.

116
00:14:02.596 --> 00:14:05.845
You're a great deal too apt
to like people in general.

117
00:14:06.015 --> 00:14:07.972
All the world is
good in your eyes.

118
00:14:08.184 --> 00:14:11.433
Not his friend. I still can't
believe what he said about you.

119
00:14:11.645 --> 00:14:14.017
Mr Darcy?

120
00:14:14.189 --> 00:14:18.980
I'd more easily forgive his vanity
had he not wounded mine.

121
00:14:19.151 --> 00:14:21.938
But no matter. I doubt
we shall ever speak again.

122
00:14:53.472 --> 00:14:55.595
He danced with Miss Lucas.

123
00:14:55.766 --> 00:14:57.639
We were all there, dear.

124
00:14:57.809 --> 00:14:59.932
It is a shame she's not more handsome.

125
00:15:00.103 --> 00:15:02.854
There's a spinster in the
making and no mistake.

126
00:15:03.022 --> 00:15:05.691
The fourth with a Miss
King of little standing,

127
00:15:05.858 --> 00:15:07.980
and the fifth again with Jane.

128
00:15:08.193 --> 00:15:11.443
If he had any compassion,
he would've sprained his ankle.

129
00:15:11.613 --> 00:15:12.775
The way you carry on,

130
00:15:12.947 --> 00:15:16.031
you'd think our girls look
forward to a grand inheritance.

131
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.488
When you die,
which may be very soon,

132
00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:23.203
they will be left without a roof over
their head nor a penny to their name.

133
00:15:23.373 --> 00:15:26.955
- Please, it's ten in the morning.
- A letter to Miss Bennet, ma'am.

134
00:15:27.126 --> 00:15:30.625
From Netherfield Hall.

135
00:15:30.837 --> 00:15:34.502
Praise the Lord. We are saved!

136
00:15:34.716 --> 00:15:39.673
Make haste, Jane,
make haste. Oh, happy day!

137
00:15:41.179 --> 00:15:43.717
It is from Caroline Bingley.

138
00:15:43.932 --> 00:15:48.640
She has invited me to dine with her.

139
00:15:48.811 --> 00:15:51.895
- Her brother will be dining out.
- Dining out?

140
00:15:52.064 --> 00:15:54.021
- Can I take the carriage?
- Let me see.

141
00:15:54.232 --> 00:15:57.897
- It is too far to walk.
- This is unaccountable of him.

142
00:15:58.111 --> 00:15:59.984
Mama, the carriage for Jane?

143
00:16:02.114 --> 00:16:05.696
Certainly not. She'll go on horseback.

144
00:16:06.451 --> 00:16:08.739
Horseback!

145
00:16:24.133 --> 00:16:25.924
Lizzie.

146
00:16:26.134 --> 00:16:29.467
Now she'll have to stay the night,
exactly as I predicted.

147
00:16:29.637 --> 00:16:32.804
Good grief, woman, your skills
in the art of matchmaking

148
00:16:32.973 --> 00:16:34.847
are positively occult.

149
00:16:35.017 --> 00:16:39.643
Though I don't think, Mama,
you can take credit for making it rain.

150
00:16:44.525 --> 00:16:48.024
"My friends will not hear of me
returning home until I am better.

151
00:16:48.195 --> 00:16:52.274
Excepting a sore throat, a fever and
a headache, nothing is wrong with me."

152
00:16:52.448 --> 00:16:57.655
If Jane does die it will be a comfort
to know it was in pursuit of Mr Bingley.

153
00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:00.158
People do not die of colds.

154
00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:03.745
But she may perish with the
shame of having such a mother.

155
00:17:04.876 --> 00:17:07.627
I must go to Netherfield at once.

156
00:17:20.722 --> 00:17:25.763
Lady Bathurst is redecorating
her ballroom in the French style.

157
00:17:25.977 --> 00:17:29.143
A little unpatriotic, don't you think?

158
00:17:31.607 --> 00:17:34.607
Miss Elizabeth Bennet.

159
00:17:48.329 --> 00:17:50.535
Good Lord, did you walk here?

160
00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:52.749
I did.

161
00:17:59.881 --> 00:18:04.127
- I'm so sorry. How is my sister?
- She's upstairs.

162
00:18:06.344 --> 00:18:08.301
Thank you.

163
00:18:17.813 --> 00:18:22.688
My goodness, did you see her hem?
Six inches deep in mud.

164
00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.023
She looked positively mediaeval.

165
00:18:25.194 --> 00:18:29.736
I feel such a terrible imposition.
They're being so kind to me.

166
00:18:29.906 --> 00:18:35.492
I don't know who is more pleased at
your being here, Mama or Mr Bingley.

167
00:18:40.582 --> 00:18:43.119
Thank you for tending
to my sister so diligently.

168
00:18:43.334 --> 00:18:45.623
She's in far better
comfort than at home.

169
00:18:45.795 --> 00:18:47.502
It's a pleasure.

170
00:18:47.713 --> 00:18:51.544
I mean, it's not a pleasure
that she's ill. Of course not.

171
00:18:51.758 --> 00:18:55.589
It's a pleasure that
she's here, being ill.

172
00:18:58.764 --> 00:19:01.052
Not going to be famous, our pig.

173
00:19:01.224 --> 00:19:04.557
Black on the back, but not related
to the learned pig of Norwich.

174
00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:07.853
- Now that pig is...
- Mr Bennet.

175
00:19:08.022 --> 00:19:11.355
It's all going to plan.
He's half in love with her already.

176
00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:13.773
- Who is, blossom?
- Mr Bingley.

177
00:19:13.985 --> 00:19:16.274
He doesn't mind that
she hasn't a penny.

178
00:19:16.487 --> 00:19:18.693
He has more than enough
for the two of them.

179
00:19:18.906 --> 00:19:20.863
- How will we meet them?
- Easy!

180
00:19:21.033 --> 00:19:22.112
Wait for me!

181
00:19:22.284 --> 00:19:27.704
You drop something. They pick it up.
And then you're introduced.

182
00:19:35.337 --> 00:19:36.416
Officers!

183
00:20:08.698 --> 00:20:12.031
You write uncommonly fast, Mr Darcy.

184
00:20:12.243 --> 00:20:14.282
You're mistaken. I write slowly.

185
00:20:14.495 --> 00:20:18.077
How many letters you must
have occasion to write, Mr Darcy.

186
00:20:18.248 --> 00:20:21.118
Letters of business.
How odious I should think them.

187
00:20:21.292 --> 00:20:24.163
It is fortunate, then,
they fall to me and not you.

188
00:20:24.337 --> 00:20:26.874
Tell your sister I long to see her.

189
00:20:27.089 --> 00:20:30.422
- I've already told her once.
- I do dote on her.

190
00:20:30.592 --> 00:20:33.842
I was quite in raptures at her
beautiful design for a table.

191
00:20:34.012 --> 00:20:37.261
Perhaps you will give me leave
to defer your raptures.

192
00:20:37.431 --> 00:20:39.554
I have not room enough
to do them justice.

193
00:20:39.767 --> 00:20:42.601
You young ladies are so accomplished.

194
00:20:42.769 --> 00:20:46.268
- What do you mean?
- You paint tables, play the piano

195
00:20:46.439 --> 00:20:47.849
and embroider cushions.

196
00:20:48.024 --> 00:20:51.190
I never heard of a lady,
but people say she's accomplished.

197
00:20:51.401 --> 00:20:53.607
The word is applied too liberally.

198
00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.943
I do not know more than
half a dozen women

199
00:20:56.114 --> 00:20:58.900
- that are truly accomplished.
- Nor I.

200
00:20:59.075 --> 00:21:02.241
Goodness, you must comprehend
a great deal in the idea.

201
00:21:02.411 --> 00:21:04.035
- I do.
- Absolutely.

202
00:21:04.246 --> 00:21:07.910
She must have a knowledge of music,
singing, drawing, dancing

203
00:21:08.082 --> 00:21:11.415
and the modern languages
to deserve the word.

204
00:21:11.627 --> 00:21:15.458
And something in her air
and manner of walking.

205
00:21:15.672 --> 00:21:18.542
And she must improve her
mind by extensive reading.

206
00:21:18.716 --> 00:21:22.464
I'm no longer surprised at your
knowing only six accomplished women.

207
00:21:22.636 --> 00:21:25.969
- I wonder at you knowing any.
- Are you so severe on your own sex?

208
00:21:26.181 --> 00:21:30.641
I never saw such a woman. She would
certainly be a fearsome thing to behold.

209
00:21:33.062 --> 00:21:36.561
Miss Elizabeth, let us take
a turn about the room.

210
00:21:53.788 --> 00:21:58.496
It's refreshing, is it not,
after sitting so long in one attitude?

211
00:21:58.709 --> 00:22:01.958
It is a small kind of
accomplishment, I suppose.

212
00:22:02.128 --> 00:22:04.334
Will you not join us, Mr Darcy?

213
00:22:04.547 --> 00:22:08.046
You can only have two motives,
and I would interfere with either.

214
00:22:08.258 --> 00:22:10.298
What can he mean?

215
00:22:10.469 --> 00:22:13.718
The surest way to disappoint
him would be to ask him nothing.

216
00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:16.681
Do tell us, Mr Darcy.

217
00:22:18.767 --> 00:22:21.056
Either you are in each
other's confidence

218
00:22:21.228 --> 00:22:23.350
and you have secret
affairs to discuss,

219
00:22:23.563 --> 00:22:25.769
or you are conscious
that your figures

220
00:22:25.982 --> 00:22:29.148
appear to the greatest
advantage by walking.

221
00:22:30.611 --> 00:22:33.397
If the first, I should
get in your way.

222
00:22:33.572 --> 00:22:36.489
If the second, I can admire
you much better from here.

223
00:22:36.657 --> 00:22:39.029
How shall we punish him
for such a speech?

224
00:22:39.201 --> 00:22:43.245
- We could laugh at him.
- No. Mr Darcy is not to be teased.

225
00:22:43.413 --> 00:22:48.121
Are you too proud, Mr Darcy? And would
you consider pride a fault or a virtue?

226
00:22:48.292 --> 00:22:51.293
- I couldn't say.
- We're trying to find a fault in you.

227
00:22:51.503 --> 00:22:54.587
I find it hard to forgive the
follies and vices of others,

228
00:22:54.756 --> 00:22:56.547
or their offences against me.

229
00:22:56.758 --> 00:23:00.257
My good opinion, once lost,
is lost forever.

230
00:23:02.221 --> 00:23:05.387
Oh, dear. I cannot
tease you about that.

231
00:23:05.557 --> 00:23:07.680
What a shame,
for I dearly love to laugh.

232
00:23:07.892 --> 00:23:10.098
A family trait, I think.

233
00:23:38.669 --> 00:23:44.089
A Mrs Bennet, a Miss Bennet,
a Miss Bennet and a Miss Bennet, sir.

234
00:23:44.257 --> 00:23:47.257
Are we to receive every
Bennet in the country?

235
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.303
What an excellent room you have, sir.

236
00:23:53.473 --> 00:23:57.137
Such expensive furnishings.

237
00:23:57.309 --> 00:24:00.310
I do hope you intend
to stay here, Mr Bingley.

238
00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:05.312
Absolutely, I find the country very
diverting. Don't you agree, Darcy?

239
00:24:05.483 --> 00:24:07.191
I find it perfectly adequate.

240
00:24:07.401 --> 00:24:10.271
Even if society is a little
less varied than in town.

241
00:24:10.446 --> 00:24:12.319
Less varied? Not at all.

242
00:24:12.531 --> 00:24:16.575
We dine with four and 20
families of all shapes and sizes.

243
00:24:16.743 --> 00:24:21.203
Sir William Lucas, for instance,
is a very agreeable man.

244
00:24:21.413 --> 00:24:25.161
And a good deal less self-important
than some people half his rank.

245
00:24:25.375 --> 00:24:29.039
Mr Bingley, is it true
you will hold a ball here?

246
00:24:29.211 --> 00:24:30.753
A ball?

247
00:24:30.921 --> 00:24:35.629
It would be an excellent way to meet
new friends. You could invite the militia.

248
00:24:35.842 --> 00:24:37.799
- Oh, do hold a ball!
- Kitty!

249
00:24:38.136 --> 00:24:40.840
When your sister recovers,
you shall name the day.

250
00:24:41.013 --> 00:24:45.556
I think a ball is an irrational
way to gain new acquaintance.

251
00:24:45.767 --> 00:24:49.895
It would be better if conversation,
not dancing, were the order of the day.

252
00:24:50.063 --> 00:24:54.190
Indeed, much more rational,
but rather less like a ball.

253
00:24:54.358 --> 00:24:55.982
Thank you, Mary.

254
00:24:57.068 --> 00:25:01.362
What a fine imposing place to
be sure, is it not, my dears?

255
00:25:01.531 --> 00:25:04.864
There's no house to
equal it in the county.

256
00:25:05.075 --> 00:25:06.783
- Mr Darcy.
- Miss Bennet.

257
00:25:06.952 --> 00:25:09.787
- There she is.
- I don't know how to thank you.

258
00:25:09.954 --> 00:25:12.789
You're welcome any time
you feel the least bit poorly.

259
00:25:12.957 --> 00:25:16.123
Thank you for your stimulating
company. Most instructive.

260
00:25:16.293 --> 00:25:19.875
Not at all. The pleasure is all mine.

261
00:25:22.548 --> 00:25:24.505
- Mr Darcy.
- Miss Elizabeth.

262
00:25:36.936 --> 00:25:41.893
And then there was one
with great long lashes, like a cow.

263
00:25:42.065 --> 00:25:44.816
Ask Mrs Hill to order
us a sirloin, Betsy.

264
00:25:44.984 --> 00:25:48.400
Just the one, mind.
We're not made of money.

265
00:25:50.864 --> 00:25:54.778
I hope, my dear, you've
ordered a good dinner today.

266
00:25:54.993 --> 00:25:58.824
I've reason to expect an
addition to our family party.

267
00:25:59.038 --> 00:26:01.789
His name's Mr Collins,
the dreaded cousin.

268
00:26:01.957 --> 00:26:04.412
- Who is to inherit?
- Everything.

269
00:26:04.626 --> 00:26:07.461
Even my piano stool
belongs to Mr Collins.

270
00:26:07.628 --> 00:26:08.624
When?

271
00:26:08.838 --> 00:26:11.838
He may turn us out of the
house as soon as he pleases.

272
00:26:12.049 --> 00:26:15.298
The estate passes directly to
him and not to us poor females.

273
00:26:20.723 --> 00:26:22.929
Mr Collins, at your service.

274
00:26:32.316 --> 00:26:36.230
What a superbly featured room
and what excellent potatoes.

275
00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:41.400
It's many years since I've had
such an exemplary vegetable.

276
00:26:41.574 --> 00:26:45.867
To which fair cousin should I compliment
the excellence of the cooking?

277
00:26:46.078 --> 00:26:48.533
We are perfectly able to keep a cook.

278
00:26:48.705 --> 00:26:50.662
Excellent.

279
00:26:50.832 --> 00:26:54.247
I'm very pleased the estate
can afford such a living.

280
00:26:57.796 --> 00:27:01.211
I'm honoured to have as my
patroness Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

281
00:27:01.382 --> 00:27:04.003
You've heard of her, I presume?

282
00:27:04.176 --> 00:27:08.174
My small rectory abuts her estate,

283
00:27:08.347 --> 00:27:11.016
Rosings Park, and she
often condescends

284
00:27:11.182 --> 00:27:17.018
to drive by my humble dwelling
in her little phaeton and ponies.

285
00:27:17.188 --> 00:27:18.812
Does she have any family?

286
00:27:19.022 --> 00:27:23.482
One daughter, the heiress of Rosings
and very extensive property.

287
00:27:23.693 --> 00:27:25.816
I've often observed to Lady Catherine

288
00:27:25.987 --> 00:27:29.071
that her daughter seemed
born to be a duchess,

289
00:27:29.281 --> 00:27:35.034
for she has all the superior
graces of elevated rank.

290
00:27:35.245 --> 00:27:38.993
These kind of compliments are
always acceptable to the ladies,

291
00:27:39.206 --> 00:27:43.499
and which I conceive myself
particularly bound to pay.

292
00:27:43.668 --> 00:27:46.206
How happy for you, Mr Collins,

293
00:27:46.379 --> 00:27:49.961
to possess the talent for
flattering with such delicacy.

294
00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:55.549
Do these attentions proceed
from the impulse of the moment

295
00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.175
or are they the result
of previous study?

296
00:27:58.389 --> 00:28:00.927
They arise from what
is passing at the time.

297
00:28:01.142 --> 00:28:05.518
And though I do sometimes amuse myself
with arranging such little compliments,

298
00:28:05.729 --> 00:28:09.311
I always wish to give them
as unstudied an air as possible.

299
00:28:09.524 --> 00:28:13.603
Oh, believe me, no one would suspect
your manners to be rehearsed.

300
00:28:20.324 --> 00:28:23.823
After dinner, I thought I might
read to you for an hour or two.

301
00:28:23.994 --> 00:28:26.995
<i>I have with me Fordyce's Sermons</i>

302
00:28:27.164 --> 00:28:31.624
which speak very eloquently
on all matters moral.

303
00:28:31.834 --> 00:28:36.211
<i>Are you familiar with Fordyce's
Sermons, Miss Bennet?</i>

304
00:28:41.176 --> 00:28:46.133
Mrs Bennet, I have been bestowed by the
good grace of Lady Catherine de Bourgh

305
00:28:46.305 --> 00:28:48.760
a parsonage of no mean size.

306
00:28:48.932 --> 00:28:51.055
I have become aware of the fact.

307
00:28:51.267 --> 00:28:55.181
It is my avowed hope that soon
I may find a mistress for it.

308
00:28:55.354 --> 00:28:58.770
And I have to inform you
that the eldest Miss Bennet

309
00:28:58.941 --> 00:29:02.772
has captured my special attention.

310
00:29:02.986 --> 00:29:05.690
Oh, Mr Collins.

311
00:29:05.863 --> 00:29:09.991
Unfortunately, it is incumbent upon me

312
00:29:10.159 --> 00:29:16.410
to hint that the eldest Miss Bennet
is very soon to be engaged.

313
00:29:16.581 --> 00:29:17.909
Engaged.

314
00:29:18.082 --> 00:29:20.537
But Miss Lizzie, next to
her in age and beauty,

315
00:29:20.751 --> 00:29:24.166
would make anyone an excellent partner.

316
00:29:24.337 --> 00:29:28.381
Do not you agree? Mr Collins?

317
00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:32.926
Indeed. Indeed.

318
00:29:33.136 --> 00:29:35.592
A very agreeable alternative.

319
00:29:57.615 --> 00:30:01.198
Mr Collins is a man who makes
you despair at the entire sex.

320
00:30:01.369 --> 00:30:05.662
- Yours, I believe.
- Oh, Mr Wickham, how perfect you are.

321
00:30:05.873 --> 00:30:09.039
He picked up my handkerchief.
Did you drop yours on purpose?

322
00:30:09.209 --> 00:30:10.667
Mr Wickham is a lieutenant.

323
00:30:10.835 --> 00:30:13.670
- An enchanted lieutenant.
- What are you up to, Liddy?

324
00:30:13.838 --> 00:30:16.921
- We happened to be looking for ribbon.
- White, for the ball.

325
00:30:17.132 --> 00:30:19.670
Shall we all look for
some ribbon together?

326
00:30:22.804 --> 00:30:26.219
- Good afternoon, Mr James.
- Miss Lydia, Miss Bennet.

327
00:30:26.432 --> 00:30:27.926
I shan't even browse.

328
00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:30.851
I can't be trusted.
I have poor taste in ribbons.

329
00:30:31.019 --> 00:30:33.556
Only a truly confident
man would admit that.

330
00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:35.188
No, it's true.

331
00:30:35.356 --> 00:30:38.522
And buckles. When it
comes to buckles, I'm lost.

332
00:30:38.692 --> 00:30:42.107
- You must be the shame of the regiment.
- The laughing stock.

333
00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.404
What do your superiors do with you?

334
00:30:46.866 --> 00:30:51.077
Ignore me. I'm of next to no
importance, so it's easily done.

335
00:30:52.245 --> 00:30:55.411
- Lizzie, lend me some money.
- You already owe me a fortune.

336
00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:59.873
- Allow me to oblige.
- No, Mr Wickham, please...

337
00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:07.628
I insist.

338
00:31:10.803 --> 00:31:13.887
- I pity the French.
- So do I.

339
00:31:14.055 --> 00:31:16.724
- Look, Mr Bingley.
- Mr Bingley!

340
00:31:16.891 --> 00:31:19.097
I was just on my way to your house.

341
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:22.394
How do you like my
ribbons for your ball?

342
00:31:22.604 --> 00:31:26.020
- Very beautiful.
- She is. Look, she's blooming.

343
00:31:26.191 --> 00:31:27.815
Oh, Lydia.

344
00:31:28.026 --> 00:31:31.608
Be sure to invite Mr Wickham.
He is a credit to his profession.

345
00:31:31.779 --> 00:31:35.112
You can't invite people
to other people's balls.

346
00:31:35.699 --> 00:31:37.905
Of course, you must come, Mr Wickham.

347
00:31:38.076 --> 00:31:42.536
If you'll excuse me,
ladies, enjoy the day.

348
00:31:45.207 --> 00:31:48.457
Do you plan to go to the
Netherfield ball, Mr Wickham?

349
00:31:48.626 --> 00:31:54.166
Perhaps. How long has
Mr Darcy been a guest there?

350
00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:56.213
About a month.

351
00:31:56.383 --> 00:32:01.922
Forgive me, but are you
acquainted with him, with Mr Darcy?

352
00:32:02.096 --> 00:32:06.389
Indeed, I've been connected
with his family since infancy.

353
00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:11.475
You may well be surprised,
given our cold greeting this afternoon.

354
00:32:14.273 --> 00:32:17.772
I hope your plans in favour
of Meryton will not be affected

355
00:32:17.943 --> 00:32:21.987
- by your relations with the gentleman.
- It is not for me to be driven away.

356
00:32:22.155 --> 00:32:27.112
If he wishes to avoid
seeing me, he must go, not I.

357
00:32:27.326 --> 00:32:31.952
I must ask, what is the manner
of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?

358
00:32:35.166 --> 00:32:38.332
My father managed his estate.

359
00:32:38.544 --> 00:32:41.710
We grew up together, Darcy and I.

360
00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:47.882
His father treated me like a
second son, loved me like a son.

361
00:32:48.094 --> 00:32:50.549
We were both with him the day he died.

362
00:32:52.556 --> 00:32:54.429
With his last breath,

363
00:32:54.599 --> 00:32:57.765
his father bequeathed me
the rectory in his estate.

364
00:32:57.977 --> 00:33:01.559
He knew I had my heart
set on joining the Church.

365
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:05.063
But Darcy ignored his wishes
and gave the living to another man.

366
00:33:05.275 --> 00:33:08.062
- But why?
- Jealousy.

367
00:33:10.071 --> 00:33:12.692
His father...

368
00:33:12.865 --> 00:33:15.949
Well, he loved me better
and Darcy couldn't stand it.

369
00:33:17.035 --> 00:33:19.704
- How cruel.
- So now I'm a poor foot-soldier.

370
00:33:19.871 --> 00:33:23.619
Too lowly even to be noticed.

371
00:33:35.259 --> 00:33:39.635
- Breathe in!
- I can't anymore. You're hurting.

372
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:44.053
Betsy.

373
00:33:45.184 --> 00:33:46.808
Betsy!

374
00:33:58.237 --> 00:34:02.483
- There must've been a misunderstanding.
- Jane, you never think ill of anybody.

375
00:34:02.657 --> 00:34:06.239
How could Mr Darcy do such a thing?

376
00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:09.743
I will discover the truth
from Mr Bingley this evening.

377
00:34:09.955 --> 00:34:12.243
Let Mr Darcy contradict it himself.

378
00:34:12.415 --> 00:34:14.704
Till he does, I hope
never to encounter him.

379
00:34:14.876 --> 00:34:17.164
Poor, unfortunate, Mr Wickham.

380
00:34:17.378 --> 00:34:19.501
Wickham is twice the man Darcy is.

381
00:34:19.671 --> 00:34:23.419
And, let us hope,
a rather more willing dancer.

382
00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:30.470
There they are, look.

383
00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:33.805
- Oh, yes.
- Billy.

384
00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:41.519
Jane Martin is here.

385
00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:12.963
May I say what an immense
pleasure it is to see you again.

386
00:35:13.175 --> 00:35:15.215
- Mrs Bennet.
- Miss Bingley.

387
00:35:15.427 --> 00:35:16.423
Charming.

388
00:35:19.222 --> 00:35:21.179
I'm so pleased you're here.

389
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:23.555
So am I.

390
00:35:23.768 --> 00:35:28.725
And how are you? Miss Elizabeth?
Are you looking for someone?

391
00:35:28.939 --> 00:35:33.399
No, not at all, I was just
admiring the general splendour.

392
00:35:33.568 --> 00:35:37.316
- It is breathtaking, Mr Bingley.
- Good.

393
00:35:45.244 --> 00:35:49.952
You might have passed a few
pleasantries with Mr Bingley.

394
00:35:50.123 --> 00:35:53.871
I've never met a more pleasant
gentleman in all my years.

395
00:35:54.085 --> 00:35:56.540
Did you see how he dotes on her?

396
00:35:56.712 --> 00:36:01.420
Dear Jane, always doing
what's best for her family.

397
00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:20.896
- Charlotte!
- Lizzie!

398
00:36:21.066 --> 00:36:25.858
- Have you seen Mr Wickham?
- No. Perhaps he's through here.

399
00:36:38.122 --> 00:36:42.416
Lizzie, Mr Wickham is not here.
Apparently, he's been detained.

400
00:36:42.626 --> 00:36:45.876
Detained where?
He must be here.

401
00:36:46.088 --> 00:36:50.298
- There you are.
- Mr Collins.

402
00:36:50.466 --> 00:36:53.965
Perhaps you will do me
the honour, Miss Elizabeth.

403
00:36:54.178 --> 00:36:58.257
Oh, I did not think
you danced, Mr Collins.

404
00:36:58.431 --> 00:37:02.974
I do not think it incompatible
with the office of a clergyman.

405
00:37:03.144 --> 00:37:06.559
Several people, her Ladyship
included, have complimented me

406
00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:10.395
on my lightness of foot.

407
00:37:35.046 --> 00:37:39.754
Apparently, your Mr Wickham has
been called on some business to town.

408
00:37:43.094 --> 00:37:47.138
Dancing is of little consequence
to me, but it does...

409
00:37:47.306 --> 00:37:50.888
...but it does afford the
opportunity to lavish...

410
00:37:54.854 --> 00:37:59.231
...upon one's partner attentions...
- My informer tells me...

411
00:37:59.442 --> 00:38:04.482
...that he would be less inclined
to be engaged, were it not for...

412
00:38:04.696 --> 00:38:06.902
...the presence of
a certain gentleman.

413
00:38:07.115 --> 00:38:09.154
Which is my primary object.

414
00:38:09.367 --> 00:38:12.153
That gentleman barely warrants the name.

415
00:38:12.328 --> 00:38:15.245
It is my intention,
if I may be so bold,

416
00:38:15.413 --> 00:38:17.951
to remain close to you
throughout the evening.

417
00:38:32.428 --> 00:38:34.800
May I have the next dance,
Miss Elizabeth?

418
00:38:35.013 --> 00:38:36.887
You may.

419
00:38:47.024 --> 00:38:51.151
- Did I agree to dance with Mr Darcy?
- I dare say you will find him amiable.

420
00:38:51.319 --> 00:38:56.360
It would be most inconvenient since
I've sworn to loathe him for all eternity.

421
00:39:11.336 --> 00:39:15.167
- I love this dance.
- Indeed. Most invigorating.

422
00:39:19.301 --> 00:39:21.756
It is your turn to say
something, Mr Darcy.

423
00:39:23.263 --> 00:39:24.721
I talked about the dance.

424
00:39:24.889 --> 00:39:29.764
Now you ought to remark on the size
of the room or the number of couples.

425
00:39:29.935 --> 00:39:34.015
I'm perfectly happy to oblige.
What would you like most to hear?

426
00:39:34.189 --> 00:39:36.477
That reply will do for present.

427
00:39:39.735 --> 00:39:41.858
Perhaps by and by I may observe

428
00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:45.237
that private balls are much
pleasanter than public ones.

429
00:39:47.825 --> 00:39:50.992
For now, we may remain silent.

430
00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:01.793
Do you talk as a rule while dancing?

431
00:40:02.004 --> 00:40:05.835
No. No, I prefer to be
unsociable and taciturn.

432
00:40:09.844 --> 00:40:13.259
Makes it all so much more
enjoyable, don't you think?

433
00:40:15.641 --> 00:40:19.554
Tell me, do you and your sisters
very often walk to Meryton?

434
00:40:22.271 --> 00:40:25.687
Yes, we often walk to Meryton.

435
00:40:25.858 --> 00:40:28.811
It's a great opportunity
to meet new people.

436
00:40:30.695 --> 00:40:34.609
When you met us, we'd just had the
pleasure of forming a new acquaintance.

437
00:40:36.492 --> 00:40:40.703
Mr Wickham's blessed with such happy
manners, he's sure of making friends.

438
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:43.622
Whether he's capable
of retaining them is less so.

439
00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:49.542
He's been so unfortunate as to lose
your friendship. That is irreversible?

440
00:40:49.753 --> 00:40:53.880
- It is. Why do you ask such a question?
- To make out your character.

441
00:40:54.048 --> 00:40:56.503
- What have you discovered?
- Very little.

442
00:40:56.759 --> 00:41:00.258
I hear such different accounts
of you as puzzle me exceedingly.

443
00:41:01.638 --> 00:41:04.176
I hope to afford you more
clarity in the future.

444
00:41:50.847 --> 00:41:53.717
- Is that Mr Darcy of Pemberley?
- I believe so.

445
00:41:53.891 --> 00:41:55.682
I must make myself known to him.

446
00:41:55.851 --> 00:41:58.768
He's a nephew of my patroness,
Lady Catherine.

447
00:41:58.937 --> 00:42:01.890
He will consider it an impertinence.

448
00:42:02.064 --> 00:42:04.602
Mr Darcy.

449
00:42:04.775 --> 00:42:06.898
Mr Darcy.

450
00:42:07.986 --> 00:42:12.778
Mr Darcy. Good evening...

451
00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:15.907
What interesting relatives you have.

452
00:42:33.299 --> 00:42:37.131
Mary, dear, you've
delighted us long enough.

453
00:42:37.344 --> 00:42:40.677
Let the other young ladies have a turn.

454
00:42:43.683 --> 00:42:46.387
... since I was a child,
and then she died.

455
00:42:46.561 --> 00:42:48.268
I have a beautiful grey.

456
00:42:48.479 --> 00:42:52.310
Of course, Caroline's a much
better rider than I, of course.

457
00:42:56.277 --> 00:43:00.654
Oh, yes. We fully expect a
most advantageous marriage.

458
00:43:01.823 --> 00:43:05.951
And my Jane, marrying so grand,
must throw her sisters in the way.

459
00:43:28.096 --> 00:43:33.137
Clearly my family are seeing who can
expose themselves to the most ridicule.

460
00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:37.264
- At least Bingley has not noticed.
- No.

461
00:43:37.437 --> 00:43:40.936
- I think he likes her very much.
- But does she like him?

462
00:43:41.107 --> 00:43:45.234
Few of us are secure enough to be
in love without proper encouragement.

463
00:43:45.402 --> 00:43:47.774
Bingley likes her enormously,

464
00:43:47.988 --> 00:43:50.692
but might not do more
if she does not help him on.

465
00:43:50.865 --> 00:43:54.613
She's just shy. If he cannot
perceive her regard, he is a fool.

466
00:43:54.785 --> 00:43:57.240
We are all fools in love.

467
00:43:57.412 --> 00:44:00.413
He does not know her
character as we do.

468
00:44:00.623 --> 00:44:02.995
She should move fast
and snap him up.

469
00:44:03.167 --> 00:44:06.583
There is plenty of time for us
to get to know him afterwards.

470
00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:11.711
I can't help feeling that someone's
going to produce a piglet

471
00:44:11.883 --> 00:44:13.840
and make us chase it.

472
00:44:21.057 --> 00:44:24.307
- Oh, dear!
- I do apologise, sir.

473
00:44:24.519 --> 00:44:28.432
I'm awfully sorry.
Do forgive me.

474
00:44:47.997 --> 00:44:50.203
Emily, please!

475
00:44:51.625 --> 00:44:56.085
Mary, my dear Mary.
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

476
00:44:56.254 --> 00:44:59.420
- I've been practising all week.
- I know, my dear.

477
00:44:59.632 --> 00:45:02.004
I hate balls.

478
00:45:20.983 --> 00:45:23.272
Mr Bennet, wake up.

479
00:45:23.444 --> 00:45:28.152
Oh, I've never had such a good time!

480
00:45:30.533 --> 00:45:32.905
Charles, you cannot be serious.

481
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:45.503
We'll have a wedding here in less than
three months if you ask me, Mr Bennet.

482
00:45:48.257 --> 00:45:49.834
Mr Bennet!

483
00:45:55.554 --> 00:45:58.259
Mary, please.

484
00:46:06.355 --> 00:46:08.644
Thank you, Mr Hill.

485
00:46:26.331 --> 00:46:29.414
Mrs Bennet, I was hoping,
if it would not trouble you,

486
00:46:29.625 --> 00:46:34.251
that I might solicit a private
audience with Miss Elizabeth.

487
00:46:34.462 --> 00:46:40.132
Oh, certainly, Lizzie would
be very happy indeed.

488
00:46:40.301 --> 00:46:44.677
Everyone, out. Mr Collins would like
a private audience with your sister.

489
00:46:44.888 --> 00:46:49.265
Wait, Mr Collins can have nothing to
say to me that anybody need not hear.

490
00:46:49.475 --> 00:46:53.389
I desire you will stay where you are.
Everyone else to the drawing room.

491
00:46:53.562 --> 00:46:55.104
- Mr Bennet.
- But...

492
00:46:55.272 --> 00:46:57.644
Now.

493
00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:03.441
- Jane. Jane, don't... Jane!
- Jane.

494
00:47:06.114 --> 00:47:09.198
Papa, stay.

495
00:47:35.639 --> 00:47:37.347
Dear Miss Elizabeth,

496
00:47:37.558 --> 00:47:41.140
My attentions have been
too marked to be mistaken.

497
00:47:41.353 --> 00:47:43.724
Almost as soon as
I entered the house,

498
00:47:43.938 --> 00:47:49.062
I singled you out as the
companion of my future life.

499
00:47:49.276 --> 00:47:51.945
But before I am run
away with my feelings,

500
00:47:52.112 --> 00:47:54.863
perhaps I may state
my reasons for marrying.

501
00:47:55.031 --> 00:47:57.486
Firstly, that it is the
duty of a clergyman

502
00:47:57.658 --> 00:48:00.327
to set the example of
matrimony in his parish.

503
00:48:00.494 --> 00:48:04.491
Secondly, I am convinced it
will add greatly to my happiness.

504
00:48:04.664 --> 00:48:07.581
And thirdly,
that it is at the urging

505
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:11.332
of my esteemed patroness,
Lady Catherine,

506
00:48:11.503 --> 00:48:13.875
that I select a wife.

507
00:48:14.089 --> 00:48:17.173
My object in coming to Longbourn
was to choose such a one

508
00:48:17.342 --> 00:48:19.381
from among Mr Bennet's daughters,

509
00:48:19.552 --> 00:48:22.469
for I am to inherit the estate

510
00:48:22.638 --> 00:48:25.804
and such an alliance will surely...

511
00:48:27.016 --> 00:48:28.890
...suit everyone.

512
00:48:31.062 --> 00:48:35.604
And now nothing remains but for me to
assure you in the most animated language

513
00:48:35.774 --> 00:48:38.311
- of the violence of my affections.
- Mr Collins!

514
00:48:38.526 --> 00:48:40.649
And no reproach on
the subject of fortune

515
00:48:40.862 --> 00:48:45.487
- will cross my lips once we're married.
- You forget I have given no answer.

516
00:48:45.657 --> 00:48:49.240
Lady Catherine will thoroughly
approve when I speak to her

517
00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:54.535
of your modesty, economy
and other amiable qualities.

518
00:48:54.707 --> 00:48:59.415
Sir, I am honoured by your proposal,
but I regret that I must decline it.

519
00:49:00.587 --> 00:49:04.500
I know ladies don't
seek to seem too eager...

520
00:49:04.715 --> 00:49:08.380
Mr Collins, I am perfectly serious.
You could not make me happy.

521
00:49:08.552 --> 00:49:12.216
And I'm the last woman in the
world who could make you happy.

522
00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:16.972
I flatter myself that your refusal
is merely a natural delicacy.

523
00:49:17.142 --> 00:49:19.977
Besides, despite manifold attractions,

524
00:49:20.145 --> 00:49:24.438
it is by no means certain another offer
of marriage will ever be made to you.

525
00:49:24.649 --> 00:49:28.231
I must conclude that you simply seek
to increase my love by suspense,

526
00:49:28.444 --> 00:49:32.820
according to the usual
practice of elegant females.

527
00:49:32.989 --> 00:49:36.571
I am not the sort of female
to torment a respectable man.

528
00:49:36.742 --> 00:49:39.280
Please understand me,
I cannot accept you.

529
00:49:46.542 --> 00:49:49.709
Headstrong, foolish child.

530
00:49:57.677 --> 00:50:03.595
Don't worry, Mr Collins. We'll have this
little hiccup dealt with immediately.

531
00:50:04.724 --> 00:50:08.223
Lizzie. Lizzie!

532
00:50:12.356 --> 00:50:16.649
Mr Bennet, we're all in an uproar!

533
00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:20.524
You must come and make
Lizzie marry Mr Collins.

534
00:50:20.696 --> 00:50:23.152
Mr Collins has proposed to Lizzie,

535
00:50:23.365 --> 00:50:26.948
but she vowed she will not
have him, and now the danger is

536
00:50:27.119 --> 00:50:29.953
Mr Collins may not have Lizzie.

537
00:50:30.121 --> 00:50:34.747
- What am I to do?
- Well, come and talk to her.

538
00:50:34.917 --> 00:50:36.079
Now!

539
00:50:48.762 --> 00:50:51.846
- Tell her you insist they marry.
- Papa, please.

540
00:50:52.015 --> 00:50:56.094
You will have this house and
save your sisters from destitution.

541
00:50:56.268 --> 00:50:59.222
- I can't marry him.
- Go and say you've changed your mind.

542
00:50:59.396 --> 00:51:01.934
- Think of your family.
- You cannot make me.

543
00:51:02.107 --> 00:51:04.644
Mr Bennet, say something.

544
00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:11.903
Your mother insists upon
you marrying Mr Collins.

545
00:51:12.115 --> 00:51:14.819
Yes, or I shall never see her again.

546
00:51:14.993 --> 00:51:18.990
From this day onward, you must be
a stranger to one of your parents.

547
00:51:19.163 --> 00:51:21.618
Who will maintain you
when your father is dead?

548
00:51:21.832 --> 00:51:25.663
Your mother will never see you
again if you do not marry Mr Collins,

549
00:51:25.835 --> 00:51:29.001
and I will never see
you again if you do.

550
00:51:29.171 --> 00:51:30.796
Thank you, Papa.

551
00:51:34.551 --> 00:51:39.177
Ungrateful child!
I shall never speak to you again.

552
00:51:39.388 --> 00:51:42.057
Not that I take much
pleasure in talking.

553
00:51:43.058 --> 00:51:45.809
People who suffer as I do
from nervous complaints

554
00:51:45.977 --> 00:51:48.978
can have no pleasure
in talking to anybody.

555
00:51:49.188 --> 00:51:50.896
Jane!

556
00:51:54.192 --> 00:51:58.320
What's the matter? Jane?

557
00:52:52.826 --> 00:52:56.241
I don't understand what would
take him from Netherfield.

558
00:52:56.412 --> 00:52:58.700
Why does he not know when he'll return?

559
00:52:58.872 --> 00:53:00.035
Read it.

560
00:53:09.298 --> 00:53:13.924
"Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister
and we are scarcely less eager.

561
00:53:14.135 --> 00:53:17.052
I do not think Georgiana Darcy
has her equal for beauty,

562
00:53:17.221 --> 00:53:21.135
elegance and accomplishment.
I hope to call her hereafter my sister."

563
00:53:21.308 --> 00:53:24.013
Is that not clear enough?

564
00:53:24.186 --> 00:53:26.890
Caroline sees her brother
in love with you

565
00:53:27.063 --> 00:53:29.732
and has taken him off to
persuade him otherwise.

566
00:53:29.899 --> 00:53:34.856
But I know her to be incapable
of wilfully deceiving anyone.

567
00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:39.696
- It's more likely he does not love me.
- He loves you. Do not give up.

568
00:53:41.909 --> 00:53:43.948
Go to our aunt and uncle's in London,

569
00:53:44.161 --> 00:53:47.743
let it be known you are there
and I am sure he will come to you.

570
00:53:57.339 --> 00:54:01.965
Give my love to my sister and
try not to be a burden, dear.

571
00:54:02.135 --> 00:54:04.590
Poor Jane.

572
00:54:04.803 --> 00:54:09.180
Still, a girl likes to be
crossed in love now and then.

573
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:11.388
It gives her something to think of

574
00:54:11.559 --> 00:54:14.725
and a sort of distinction
amongst her companions.

575
00:54:14.937 --> 00:54:18.768
- I'm sure that will cheer her up, Papa.
- It's your turn now, Lizzie.

576
00:54:18.982 --> 00:54:20.856
You've turned down Collins.

577
00:54:21.026 --> 00:54:25.319
You're free to go off
and be jilted yourself.

578
00:54:25.488 --> 00:54:27.361
What about Mr Wickham?

579
00:54:27.531 --> 00:54:30.318
He's a pleasant fellow
and he'd do the job credibly.

580
00:54:30.492 --> 00:54:34.157
- Father...
- And you have an affectionate mother

581
00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:37.952
who would make the most of it.

582
00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:59.512
- Charlotte!
- My dear Lizzie.

583
00:54:59.725 --> 00:55:05.229
I've come her to tell you the news.
Mr Collins and I are... engaged.

584
00:55:05.397 --> 00:55:07.685
- Engaged?
- Yes.

585
00:55:12.319 --> 00:55:17.194
- To be married?
- What other kind of engaged is there?

586
00:55:18.574 --> 00:55:21.990
For heaven's sake, Lizzie,
don't look at me like that.

587
00:55:22.161 --> 00:55:25.161
I should be as happy
with him as any other.

588
00:55:25.372 --> 00:55:28.159
- But he's ridiculous.
- Oh, hush.

589
00:55:28.333 --> 00:55:32.081
Not all of us can afford to be romantic.

590
00:55:32.253 --> 00:55:36.084
I've been offered a comfortable
home and protection.

591
00:55:36.256 --> 00:55:37.964
There's a lot to be thankful for.

592
00:55:38.174 --> 00:55:43.595
I'm 27 years old. I've no
money and no prospects.

593
00:55:43.763 --> 00:55:47.345
I'm already a burden to my parents.

594
00:55:47.516 --> 00:55:49.971
And I'm frightened.

595
00:55:50.143 --> 00:55:54.685
So don?t judge me, Lizzie.
Don't you dare judge me.

596
00:56:47.191 --> 00:56:50.026
<i>Dear Charlotte,
thank you for your letter.</i>

597
00:56:51.362 --> 00:56:54.528
<i>I'm glad the house, furniture
and roads are to your taste,</i>

598
00:56:54.698 --> 00:56:58.113
<i>and that Lady Catherine's
behaviour is friendly and obliging.</i>

599
00:56:58.284 --> 00:57:00.953
<i>What with your departure,
Jane's to London</i>

600
00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:04.619
<i>and the militia to the North
with the colourful Mr Wickham,</i>

601
00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:08.703
<i>I must confess, the view from
where I sit has been rather grey.</i>

602
00:57:08.918 --> 00:57:11.872
<i>As for the favour you ask,
it is no favour at all.</i>

603
00:57:12.046 --> 00:57:16.173
<i>I would be happy to visit you
at your earliest convenience.</i>

604
00:57:22.888 --> 00:57:24.928
Welcome to our humble abode.

605
00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:34.018
My wife encourages me to spend
time in the garden for my health.

606
00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:36.562
I think our guest is
tired after her journey.

607
00:57:36.775 --> 00:57:41.401
I plan many improvements. I intend to
throw out a bough and plant a lime walk.

608
00:57:41.571 --> 00:57:44.525
I flatter myself that any
young lady would be happy

609
00:57:44.699 --> 00:57:47.699
to be the mistress of such a house.

610
00:57:48.869 --> 00:57:50.742
We shan't be disturbed here.

611
00:57:50.954 --> 00:57:54.785
This parlour is for
my own particular use.

612
00:57:57.543 --> 00:58:01.622
Oh, Lizzie, it's such a
pleasure to run my own home.

613
00:58:01.797 --> 00:58:04.797
- Charlotte, come here!
- What's happened?

614
00:58:04.966 --> 00:58:08.963
Has the pig escaped again?
Oh, it's Lady Catherine.

615
00:58:09.136 --> 00:58:11.674
Come and see, Lizzie.

616
00:58:11.847 --> 00:58:14.468
Great news.

617
00:58:14.641 --> 00:58:17.890
We received an invitation to
Rosings from Lady Catherine.

618
00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:19.602
How wonderful!

619
00:58:19.770 --> 00:58:22.771
Do not make yourself
uneasy about your apparel.

620
00:58:22.981 --> 00:58:25.270
Just put on the best you've brought.

621
00:58:25.442 --> 00:58:29.984
Lady Catherine's never been
averse to the truly humble.

622
00:58:30.779 --> 00:58:34.278
One of the most extraordinary
sights in all of Europe.

623
00:58:34.491 --> 00:58:37.990
The glazing alone costs
upwards of 20,000 Pounds.

624
00:58:38.202 --> 00:58:40.740
Come along. Come along.

625
00:58:49.545 --> 00:58:52.462
A little later we'll play cards.

626
00:58:53.507 --> 00:58:56.294
Your Ladyship.

627
00:58:56.468 --> 00:58:59.468
Miss de Bourgh.

628
00:59:17.861 --> 00:59:21.360
- So, you are Elizabeth Bennet?
- I am, your Ladyship.

629
00:59:25.034 --> 00:59:27.489
This is my daughter.

630
00:59:29.621 --> 00:59:34.164
- It's kind of you to ask us to dine.
- The rug alone cost upwards of 300 Pounds.

631
00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:38.082
Mr Darcy.

632
00:59:39.505 --> 00:59:41.544
What are you doing here?

633
00:59:43.675 --> 00:59:47.174
Mr Darcy, I had no
idea we had the honour.

634
00:59:48.929 --> 00:59:54.053
- Miss Elizabeth, I'm a guest here.
- You know my nephew?

635
00:59:55.727 --> 00:59:59.142
I had the pleasure of meeting
your nephew in Hertfordshire.

636
00:59:59.355 --> 01:00:02.059
Colonel Fitzwilliam.
How do you do?

637
01:00:07.612 --> 01:00:13.614
Mr Collins, you can't sit next
to your wife. Move. Over there.

638
01:00:30.006 --> 01:00:33.670
Harvey, I wonder, could you
get me the fish course...

639
01:00:33.842 --> 01:00:37.922
I trust your family is in good health,
Miss Elizabeth?

640
01:00:38.096 --> 01:00:40.053
They are, thank you.

641
01:00:43.684 --> 01:00:46.768
My eldest sister is in London.
Perhaps you saw her there.

642
01:00:46.979 --> 01:00:48.935
I haven't been fortunate enough...

643
01:00:49.147 --> 01:00:53.524
Do you play the pianoforte,
Miss Bennet?

644
01:00:53.693 --> 01:00:58.153
- A little, ma'am, and very poorly.
- Do you draw?

645
01:00:59.447 --> 01:01:01.570
No, not at all.

646
01:01:01.783 --> 01:01:03.989
Your sisters, do they draw?

647
01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.488
Not one.

648
01:01:05.661 --> 01:01:07.155
That's very strange.

649
01:01:07.329 --> 01:01:09.950
I suppose you had no opportunity.

650
01:01:10.123 --> 01:01:14.037
Your mother should've taken you to town
for the benefit of the masters.

651
01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:18.337
My mother wouldn't have minded,
but my father hates town.

652
01:01:18.505 --> 01:01:21.921
- Has your governess left you?
- We never had a governess.

653
01:01:23.426 --> 01:01:27.589
No governess? Five daughters
brought up at home without a governess?

654
01:01:27.763 --> 01:01:31.891
I never heard such a thing. Your mother
must've been a slave to your education.

655
01:01:32.058 --> 01:01:34.098
Not at all, Lady Catherine.

656
01:01:38.939 --> 01:01:41.395
Your younger sisters,
are they out in society?

657
01:01:41.608 --> 01:01:43.731
- Yes, ma'am, all.
- All?

658
01:01:43.902 --> 01:01:46.902
What, all five out at once?
That's very odd.

659
01:01:47.071 --> 01:01:50.819
And you second. The younger ones
out before the elders are married?

660
01:01:51.575 --> 01:01:54.492
Your youngest sisters
must be very young.

661
01:01:54.661 --> 01:01:56.369
Yes, my youngest is not 16.

662
01:01:57.247 --> 01:01:59.453
But it would be hard on younger sisters

663
01:01:59.624 --> 01:02:03.288
not to have their amusement
because the elder is still unmarried.

664
01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:06.461
It would hardly encourage
sisterly affection.

665
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:11.587
Upon my word, you give your opinion
very decidedly for so young a person.

666
01:02:11.801 --> 01:02:14.470
Pray, what is your age?

667
01:02:14.636 --> 01:02:18.550
With three younger sisters grown up,
you can hardly expect me to own to it.

668
01:02:28.773 --> 01:02:30.813
Come, Miss Bennet, and play for us.

669
01:02:31.818 --> 01:02:35.316
- No, I beg you.
- For music is my delight.

670
01:02:35.487 --> 01:02:37.776
In fact, there are few
people in England

671
01:02:37.948 --> 01:02:41.862
who have more true enjoyment of music.

672
01:02:42.035 --> 01:02:43.612
Or better natural taste.

673
01:02:44.578 --> 01:02:50.164
If I had ever learnt,
I should've been a great proficient.

674
01:02:50.333 --> 01:02:54.496
So would Anne,
if her health would've allowed her.

675
01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:58.881
I'm not afflicted with false modesty,
when I say I play poorly...

676
01:02:59.049 --> 01:03:02.797
Come, Lizzie, her Ladyship demands it.

677
01:03:24.738 --> 01:03:27.904
How does Georgiana get along, Darcy?

678
01:03:28.115 --> 01:03:31.531
- She plays very well.
- I hope she practises.

679
01:03:31.702 --> 01:03:34.951
No excellence can be acquired
without constant practice.

680
01:03:35.121 --> 01:03:37.577
I've told Mrs Collins this.

681
01:03:37.790 --> 01:03:41.206
Though you have no instrument,
you're welcome to come to Rosings

682
01:03:41.377 --> 01:03:44.377
and play on the pianoforte
in the housekeeper's room.

683
01:03:44.588 --> 01:03:48.419
You'll be in nobody's way
in that part of the house.

684
01:03:55.639 --> 01:04:00.763
You mean to frighten me by
coming in all your state to hear me.

685
01:04:00.935 --> 01:04:04.849
But I won't be alarmed,
even if your sister does play so well.

686
01:04:05.022 --> 01:04:08.936
I know that I cannot alarm
you even should I wish it.

687
01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:13.064
What was my friend
like in Hertfordshire?

688
01:04:13.279 --> 01:04:16.279
You really care to know?

689
01:04:16.490 --> 01:04:19.656
Prepare yourself for
something very dreadful.

690
01:04:19.868 --> 01:04:22.868
The first time I saw him,
he danced with nobody,

691
01:04:23.037 --> 01:04:24.661
though gentlemen were scarce

692
01:04:24.872 --> 01:04:27.623
and there was more than
one lady without a partner.

693
01:04:27.791 --> 01:04:31.539
- I knew nobody beyond my own party.
- Nobody can be introduced at a ball.

694
01:04:31.753 --> 01:04:34.457
Fitzwilliam, I need you.

695
01:04:45.348 --> 01:04:47.803
I do not have the talent

696
01:04:48.017 --> 01:04:51.350
of conversing easily with people
I have never met before.

697
01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:55.434
Perhaps you should take
your aunt's advice and practise.

698
01:05:16.416 --> 01:05:19.286
<i>Dear Jane...</i>

699
01:05:31.303 --> 01:05:32.632
Mr Darcy.

700
01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.014
Please, do be seated.

701
01:05:47.984 --> 01:05:50.439
Mr and Mrs Collins
have gone to the village.

702
01:05:58.326 --> 01:06:00.283
This is a charming house.

703
01:06:00.453 --> 01:06:04.830
I believe my aunt did a great deal
to it when Mr Collins first arrived.

704
01:06:04.999 --> 01:06:07.371
I believe so.

705
01:06:08.669 --> 01:06:13.793
She could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful subject.

706
01:06:22.222 --> 01:06:25.555
- Shall I call for some tea?
- No, thank you.

707
01:06:29.603 --> 01:06:32.390
Good day, Miss Elizabeth,
it's been a pleasure.

708
01:06:38.903 --> 01:06:42.401
What on earth have you
done to poor Mr Darcy?

709
01:06:42.572 --> 01:06:44.944
I have no idea.

710
01:06:46.159 --> 01:06:48.863
Every mind must have some counsellor

711
01:06:49.036 --> 01:06:52.701
to whom it may apply
for consolation in distress.

712
01:06:52.873 --> 01:06:57.664
There are many conveniences which
others can supply and we cannot procure.

713
01:06:57.835 --> 01:06:59.709
I have in view those objects

714
01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:03.004
which are only to be
obtained through intercourse...

715
01:07:05.383 --> 01:07:10.590
Forgive me, through the
intercourse of friendship or civility.

716
01:07:10.805 --> 01:07:16.557
On such occasions, the proud man steps
forth to meet you not with cordiality,

717
01:07:16.768 --> 01:07:21.560
but with the suspicion of one
who reconnoitres an enemy...

718
01:07:21.772 --> 01:07:25.355
- How long do you plan to stay?
- As long as Darcy chooses.

719
01:07:25.525 --> 01:07:28.775
- I am at his disposal.
- Everyone appears to be.

720
01:07:28.945 --> 01:07:32.693
I wonder he does not marry and secure
a lasting convenience of that kind.

721
01:07:32.907 --> 01:07:36.655
- She would be a lucky woman.
- Really?

722
01:07:36.868 --> 01:07:39.952
Darcy is a most loyal companion.

723
01:07:40.163 --> 01:07:43.578
He recently came to the
rescue of one of his friends.

724
01:07:43.749 --> 01:07:45.160
What happened?

725
01:07:45.334 --> 01:07:47.457
He saved him from
an imprudent marriage.

726
01:07:47.669 --> 01:07:48.832
Who's the man?

727
01:07:54.508 --> 01:07:58.173
His closest friend, Charles Bingley.

728
01:08:00.555 --> 01:08:03.509
Did Mr Darcy give a reason
for this interference?

729
01:08:03.683 --> 01:08:06.849
There were apparently
strong objections to the lady.

730
01:08:07.061 --> 01:08:10.310
What kind of objections?
Her lack of fortune?

731
01:08:10.522 --> 01:08:14.733
I think it was her family that
was considered unsuitable.

732
01:08:16.277 --> 01:08:20.985
- So he separated them?
- I believe so. I know nothing else.

733
01:08:51.265 --> 01:08:52.889
Miss Elizabeth.

734
01:08:53.058 --> 01:08:55.679
I have struggled in vain
and can bear it no longer.

735
01:08:55.852 --> 01:09:00.015
These past months have been a torment.
I came to Rosings only to see you.

736
01:09:00.189 --> 01:09:03.355
I have fought against judgement,
my family's expectation,

737
01:09:03.567 --> 01:09:06.402
the inferiority of
your birth, my rank.

738
01:09:06.570 --> 01:09:09.191
I will put them aside and
ask you to end my agony.

739
01:09:09.364 --> 01:09:12.530
- I don't understand.
- I love you.

740
01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:17.032
Most ardently.

741
01:09:20.039 --> 01:09:24.202
Please do me the honour
of accepting my hand.

742
01:09:25.628 --> 01:09:29.541
Sir, I appreciate the struggle
you have been through,

743
01:09:29.756 --> 01:09:32.294
and I am very sorry
to have caused you pain.

744
01:09:32.508 --> 01:09:34.548
It was unconsciously done.

745
01:09:35.970 --> 01:09:37.761
- Is this your reply?
- Yes, sir.

746
01:09:37.930 --> 01:09:40.634
- Are you laughing at me?
- No.

747
01:09:40.807 --> 01:09:41.970
Are you rejecting me?

748
01:09:42.183 --> 01:09:47.722
I'm sure the feelings which hindered
your regard will help you overcome it.

749
01:09:47.896 --> 01:09:51.063
Might I ask why with so little
civility I am thus repulsed?

750
01:09:51.274 --> 01:09:56.481
I might enquire why you told me you
liked me against your better judgement?

751
01:09:56.654 --> 01:09:58.942
If I was uncivil,
then that is some excuse.

752
01:09:59.114 --> 01:10:02.115
- But you know I have other reasons.
- What reasons?

753
01:10:02.284 --> 01:10:05.866
Do you think anything might tempt me
to accept the man who has ruined

754
01:10:06.037 --> 01:10:09.203
the happiness of a most beloved sister?

755
01:10:09.373 --> 01:10:14.081
Do you deny that you separated
a young couple who loved each other,

756
01:10:14.252 --> 01:10:16.624
exposing your friend
to censure for caprice

757
01:10:16.796 --> 01:10:19.631
and my sister to derision
for disappointed hopes,

758
01:10:19.799 --> 01:10:21.838
involving them both in acute misery?

759
01:10:22.050 --> 01:10:25.466
- I do not deny it.
- How could you do it?

760
01:10:25.637 --> 01:10:28.507
I believed your sister
indifferent to him.

761
01:10:28.681 --> 01:10:31.350
I realised his attachment
was deeper than hers.

762
01:10:31.517 --> 01:10:32.513
She's shy!

763
01:10:32.726 --> 01:10:35.347
Bingley was persuaded
she didn't feel strongly.

764
01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.559
- You suggested it.
- For his own good.

765
01:10:37.730 --> 01:10:40.565
My sister hardly shows
her true feelings to me.

766
01:10:44.778 --> 01:10:47.316
I suppose his fortune
had some bearing?

767
01:10:47.530 --> 01:10:50.068
I wouldn't do your sister the dishonour.

768
01:10:50.241 --> 01:10:52.280
- It was suggested...
- What was?

769
01:10:52.451 --> 01:10:54.907
It was clear an advantageous marriage...

770
01:10:55.079 --> 01:10:57.450
- Did my sister give that impression?
- No!

771
01:10:57.664 --> 01:11:01.744
- No. There was, however, your family...
- Our want of connection?

772
01:11:01.918 --> 01:11:04.373
- No, it was more than that.
- How, sir?

773
01:11:04.587 --> 01:11:09.462
The lack of propriety shown by your
mother, younger sisters and your father.

774
01:11:12.885 --> 01:11:17.843
Forgive me. You and your sister
I must exclude from this.

775
01:11:22.352 --> 01:11:24.143
And what about Mr Wickham?

776
01:11:26.397 --> 01:11:27.392
Mr Wickham?

777
01:11:27.606 --> 01:11:30.357
What excuse can you
give for your behaviour?

778
01:11:30.525 --> 01:11:33.775
- You take an eager interest.
- He told me of his misfortunes.

779
01:11:33.945 --> 01:11:36.614
- Oh, they have been great.
- You ruin his chances

780
01:11:36.781 --> 01:11:38.987
yet treat him with sarcasm.

781
01:11:39.158 --> 01:11:41.197
So this is your opinion of me?

782
01:11:41.410 --> 01:11:44.825
Thank you. Perhaps these offences
might have been overlooked

783
01:11:44.996 --> 01:11:49.289
had not your pride been hurt by
my scruples about our relationship.

784
01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:52.666
I am to rejoice in the inferiority
of your circumstances?

785
01:11:52.836 --> 01:11:55.505
And those are the words of a gentleman.

786
01:11:55.672 --> 01:12:00.380
Your arrogance and conceit, your selfish
disdain for the feelings of others

787
01:12:00.551 --> 01:12:06.304
made me realise you were the last
man in the world I could ever marry.

788
01:12:17.690 --> 01:12:22.565
Forgive me, madam,
for taking up so much of your time.

789
01:14:26.633 --> 01:14:28.756
I came to leave you this.

790
01:14:39.144 --> 01:14:42.975
I shall not renew the sentiments
which were so disgusting to you.

791
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:47.435
But if I may, I will address the two
offences you have laid against me.

792
01:14:54.032 --> 01:14:57.365
<i>My father loved Mr Wickham as a son.</i>

793
01:14:57.576 --> 01:15:01.324
<i>He left him a generous living.
But upon my father's death,</i>

794
01:15:01.496 --> 01:15:06.122
<i>Mr Wickham announced he had
no intention of taking orders.</i>

795
01:15:06.334 --> 01:15:12.087
<i>He demanded the value of the living,
which he'd gambled away within weeks.</i>

796
01:15:14.424 --> 01:15:17.590
<i>He then wrote, demanding
more money, which I refused.</i>

797
01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:20.844
<i>After which,
he severed all acquaintance.</i>

798
01:15:21.055 --> 01:15:25.431
<i>He came back to see us last summer, and
declared passionate love for my sister,</i>

799
01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:29.514
<i>whom he tried to persuade
to elope with him.</i>

800
01:15:29.687 --> 01:15:33.351
<i>She is to inherit 30,000 Pounds.</i>

801
01:15:33.523 --> 01:15:38.944
<i>When it was made clear he would never
receive a penny of it, he disappeared.</i>

802
01:15:39.112 --> 01:15:42.776
<i>I will not attempt to convey the
depth of Georgiana's despair.</i>

803
01:15:42.990 --> 01:15:46.074
<i>She was 15 years old.</i>

804
01:15:48.036 --> 01:15:51.700
<i>As to the other matter,
of your sister and Mr Bingley,</i>

805
01:15:51.914 --> 01:15:55.413
<i>though the motives which governed
me may appear insufficient,</i>

806
01:15:55.626 --> 01:15:58.959
<i>they were in the service of a friend.</i>

807
01:15:59.129 --> 01:16:01.168
Lizzie.

808
01:16:04.383 --> 01:16:06.256
Are you all right?

809
01:16:06.468 --> 01:16:09.801
I hardly know.

810
01:16:17.895 --> 01:16:20.895
Lizzie. How fortunate you have arrived.

811
01:16:21.106 --> 01:16:24.770
Your aunt and uncle are here
to deliver Jane from London.

812
01:16:24.942 --> 01:16:28.275
- How is Jane?
- She's in the drawing room.

813
01:16:30.906 --> 01:16:36.990
I'm quite over him. If he passed
me in the street, I'd hardly notice.

814
01:16:37.203 --> 01:16:41.034
London is so diverting.
It's true.

815
01:16:42.832 --> 01:16:45.501
There's so much to entertain.

816
01:16:51.214 --> 01:16:53.171
What news from Kent?

817
01:16:55.176 --> 01:16:57.050
Nothing.

818
01:16:58.721 --> 01:17:00.927
At least not much to entertain.

819
01:17:01.098 --> 01:17:02.889
Lizzie, tell Mama!

820
01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:05.769
Stop making such a fuss.

821
01:17:05.935 --> 01:17:09.767
- Why didn't she ask me as well?
- Because I'm better company.

822
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:12.518
- What's the matter?
- I've just as much right.

823
01:17:12.691 --> 01:17:14.897
Let's all go.

824
01:17:15.068 --> 01:17:18.022
Lydia's been invited to
Brighton with the Forsters.

825
01:17:18.196 --> 01:17:20.235
Sea-bathing would set me up nicely.

826
01:17:20.406 --> 01:17:22.694
I shall dine with the
officers every night.

827
01:17:22.866 --> 01:17:24.823
Papa, don't let her go.

828
01:17:25.035 --> 01:17:29.743
Lydia will never be easy until she's
exposed herself in some public place.

829
01:17:29.914 --> 01:17:34.456
And we could never expect her
to do it with so little inconvenience.

830
01:17:34.668 --> 01:17:36.707
If you do not check her,

831
01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:41.628
she'll be fixed as the silliest flirt
who ever made her family ridiculous.

832
01:17:41.841 --> 01:17:43.632
And Kitty will follow, as always.

833
01:17:43.843 --> 01:17:48.718
Lizzie, we shall have
no peace until she goes.

834
01:17:48.888 --> 01:17:52.222
Is that really all you care about?

835
01:17:52.391 --> 01:17:55.974
Colonel Forster is a sensible man.

836
01:17:56.186 --> 01:17:58.973
He will keep her out
of any real mischief.

837
01:17:59.147 --> 01:18:01.982
And she's too poor to be
an object of prey to anyone.

838
01:18:02.150 --> 01:18:03.312
It's dangerous.

839
01:18:03.526 --> 01:18:08.068
I am certain the officers will find
women better worth their while.

840
01:18:09.156 --> 01:18:12.987
Let us hope, in fact,
that her stay in Brighton

841
01:18:13.201 --> 01:18:17.992
will teach her her own insignificance.

842
01:18:18.205 --> 01:18:20.826
At any rate, she can
hardly grow any worse.

843
01:18:20.999 --> 01:18:25.542
If she does, we'd be obliged to
lock her up for the rest of her life.

844
01:18:34.803 --> 01:18:37.423
Lizzie, you're welcome to accompany us.

845
01:18:37.597 --> 01:18:39.553
The Peak District is not Brighton.

846
01:18:39.765 --> 01:18:43.264
Officers are thin on the ground
which may influence your decision.

847
01:18:43.477 --> 01:18:47.556
Come to the Peak District with us,
Lizzie, and get some fresh air.

848
01:18:47.730 --> 01:18:51.312
The glories of nature. What are men
compared to rocks and mountains?

849
01:18:51.525 --> 01:18:54.691
Men are either eaten up
with arrogance or stupidity.

850
01:18:54.861 --> 01:18:58.194
If they are amiable,
they have no minds of their own.

851
01:18:58.406 --> 01:19:01.656
Take care, my love.
That savours strongly of bitterness.

852
01:19:08.665 --> 01:19:12.911
I saw Mr Darcy when I was at Rosings.

853
01:19:13.085 --> 01:19:14.662
Why did you not tell me?

854
01:19:17.297 --> 01:19:19.752
Did he mention Mr Bingley?

855
01:19:21.884 --> 01:19:23.295
No.

856
01:19:27.722 --> 01:19:30.094
No, he did not.

857
01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:37.319
Oh, what are men compared
to rocks and mountains?

858
01:20:37.490 --> 01:20:40.989
Or carriages that work?

859
01:20:44.871 --> 01:20:47.409
Where exactly are we?

860
01:20:47.624 --> 01:20:49.995
Quite close to Pemberley.

861
01:20:51.752 --> 01:20:54.207
- Mr Darcy's home?
- That's the fellow.

862
01:20:54.379 --> 01:20:58.044
Very well-stocked lake.
I've a hankering to see it.

863
01:20:58.216 --> 01:20:59.295
Oh, no, let's not.

864
01:21:02.845 --> 01:21:05.051
Well, he's so...

865
01:21:05.264 --> 01:21:08.846
I'd rather not, he's so... he's so...

866
01:21:09.017 --> 01:21:10.725
- So what?
- So rich.

867
01:21:10.893 --> 01:21:14.060
By heavens, Lizzie,
what a snob you are!

868
01:21:14.230 --> 01:21:17.978
Objecting to Mr Darcy because of his
wealth. The poor man can't help it.

869
01:21:18.191 --> 01:21:23.612
He won't be there anyway.
These great men are never at home.

870
01:22:27.917 --> 01:22:29.292
Keep up.

871
01:22:49.727 --> 01:22:53.475
- Is your master much at home?
- Not as much as I would wish.

872
01:22:53.689 --> 01:22:56.144
He dearly loves it here.

873
01:22:56.316 --> 01:23:00.064
If he should marry,
you might see more of him.

874
01:23:08.618 --> 01:23:11.489
He's a lot like his father.

875
01:23:15.958 --> 01:23:20.418
When my husband was ill,
Mr Darcy couldn't do enough.

876
01:23:24.757 --> 01:23:28.837
He just organised the servants for me.

877
01:23:43.565 --> 01:23:47.313
This is he, Mr Darcy.

878
01:23:48.569 --> 01:23:50.692
A handsome face.

879
01:23:51.363 --> 01:23:55.111
Lizzie, is it a true likeness?

880
01:23:55.325 --> 01:23:58.740
Does the young lady
know Mr Darcy?

881
01:23:58.911 --> 01:24:01.200
Only a little.

882
01:24:01.413 --> 01:24:05.493
Do you not think him
a handsome man, miss?

883
01:24:05.667 --> 01:24:07.078
Yes.

884
01:24:09.670 --> 01:24:11.876
Yes, I dare say he is.

885
01:24:15.425 --> 01:24:18.342
This is his sister, Miss Georgiana.

886
01:24:18.803 --> 01:24:22.468
She sings and plays all day long.

887
01:24:24.725 --> 01:24:27.180
Is she at home?

888
01:26:32.959 --> 01:26:34.417
Miss Elizabeth.

889
01:26:45.678 --> 01:26:50.304
- I thought you were in London.
- No.

890
01:26:50.474 --> 01:26:52.762
No, I'm not.

891
01:26:52.934 --> 01:26:54.642
No.

892
01:26:54.811 --> 01:26:58.144
- We would not have come...
- I came back a day early...

893
01:27:03.943 --> 01:27:05.354
I'm with my aunt and uncle.

894
01:27:08.072 --> 01:27:10.111
And are you having a pleasant trip?

895
01:27:10.282 --> 01:27:12.903
Very pleasant.

896
01:27:13.076 --> 01:27:16.575
- Tomorrow we go to Matlock.
- Tomorrow?

897
01:27:18.456 --> 01:27:21.622
- Are you staying at Lambton?
- Yes, at the Rose and Crown.

898
01:27:21.834 --> 01:27:23.873
Yes.

899
01:27:27.630 --> 01:27:29.255
I'm so sorry to intrude.

900
01:27:29.465 --> 01:27:33.509
They said the house was open
for visitors. I had no idea.

901
01:27:37.514 --> 01:27:39.885
- May I see you back to the village?
- No.

902
01:27:43.477 --> 01:27:45.932
- I'm very fond of walking.
- Yes.

903
01:27:48.064 --> 01:27:49.689
Yes, I know.

904
01:27:54.528 --> 01:27:56.900
Goodbye, Mr Darcy.

905
01:28:14.628 --> 01:28:17.084
This way, sir.

906
01:28:23.094 --> 01:28:25.217
Are you sure you
wouldn't like to join us?

907
01:28:38.315 --> 01:28:41.814
We've just met Mr Darcy.
You didn't tell us that you'd seen him.

908
01:28:42.027 --> 01:28:46.653
He's asked us to dine with him tomorrow.
He was very civil, was he not?

909
01:28:46.823 --> 01:28:49.360
- Very civil.
- Not at all how you'd painted him.

910
01:28:49.575 --> 01:28:50.903
To dine with him?

911
01:28:51.076 --> 01:28:55.453
There's something pleasant
about his mouth when he speaks.

912
01:28:55.622 --> 01:28:58.539
You don't mind delaying
our journey another day?

913
01:28:58.708 --> 01:29:02.290
He particularly wants
you to meet his sister.

914
01:29:02.461 --> 01:29:04.169
His sister.

915
01:29:32.737 --> 01:29:34.776
Miss Elizabeth!

916
01:29:39.409 --> 01:29:41.366
My sister, Miss Georgiana.

917
01:29:41.577 --> 01:29:43.700
My brother has told
me so much about you,

918
01:29:43.913 --> 01:29:46.913
- I feel as if we are friends already.
- Thank you.

919
01:29:47.082 --> 01:29:50.415
- What a beautiful pianoforte.
- My brother gave it to me.

920
01:29:50.627 --> 01:29:52.584
- He shouldn't have.
- I should have.

921
01:29:52.754 --> 01:29:56.003
- Very well then.
- Easily persuaded, is she not?

922
01:29:57.132 --> 01:30:00.049
He once had to put up with my playing.

923
01:30:00.218 --> 01:30:04.926
- He says you play so well.
- Then he has perjured himself.

924
01:30:05.097 --> 01:30:08.264
- I said "quite well".
- "Quite well" is not "very well".

925
01:30:08.434 --> 01:30:10.141
I'm satisfied.

926
01:30:16.399 --> 01:30:19.316
- Mr Gardiner, are you fond of fishing?
- Very much.

927
01:30:19.485 --> 01:30:22.271
Would you accompany me
to the lake this afternoon?

928
01:30:22.445 --> 01:30:24.983
Its occupants have been
left in peace too long.

929
01:30:25.156 --> 01:30:29.367
- I would be delighted.
- Do you play duets, Miss Elizabeth?

930
01:30:29.535 --> 01:30:34.741
- Only when forced.
- Brother, you must force her.

931
01:30:34.956 --> 01:30:38.704
Splendid fishing, good company.
What a capital fellow.

932
01:30:38.876 --> 01:30:41.877
Thank you so much, Mr Darcy.

933
01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:46.003
A letter for you, madam.

934
01:30:46.174 --> 01:30:48.047
Oh, it's from Jane.

935
01:31:12.571 --> 01:31:14.694
It is the most dreadful news.

936
01:31:17.159 --> 01:31:19.365
Lydia has run away...

937
01:31:22.246 --> 01:31:24.037
...with Mr Wickham.

938
01:31:24.206 --> 01:31:26.080
They are gone to Lord knows where.

939
01:31:26.250 --> 01:31:32.252
She has no money, no connections.
I fear she is lost forever.

940
01:31:35.799 --> 01:31:37.673
This is my fault.

941
01:31:37.885 --> 01:31:41.383
If only I had exposed
Wickham when I should.

942
01:31:41.554 --> 01:31:44.555
No, this is my fault.

943
01:31:44.765 --> 01:31:48.015
I might have prevented all this
by being open with my sisters.

944
01:31:48.977 --> 01:31:51.978
Has anything been done to recover her?

945
01:31:52.188 --> 01:31:57.229
My father has gone to London,
but I know nothing can be done.

946
01:31:59.236 --> 01:32:02.071
We have not the smallest hope.

947
01:32:02.239 --> 01:32:04.112
Would I could help you.

948
01:32:04.282 --> 01:32:06.488
Sir, I think it is too late.

949
01:32:10.245 --> 01:32:14.243
This is grave indeed.
I will leave you. Goodbye.

950
01:32:14.416 --> 01:32:16.372
We must go at once.

951
01:32:16.542 --> 01:32:20.290
I will join Mr Bennet and find
Lydia before she ruins the family.

952
01:32:47.944 --> 01:32:52.819
Why did the Forsters
let her out of their sight?

953
01:32:52.990 --> 01:32:56.156
I always said they were
unfit to take charge of her.

954
01:32:56.368 --> 01:32:59.618
- And now she is ruined.
- You are all ruined.

955
01:32:59.829 --> 01:33:05.202
Who will take you now
with a fallen sister?

956
01:33:05.376 --> 01:33:08.874
Poor Mr Bennet will now have
to fight the perfidious Wickham

957
01:33:09.087 --> 01:33:10.629
and then be killed.

958
01:33:10.797 --> 01:33:12.670
He hasn't found him yet, Mama.

959
01:33:12.882 --> 01:33:15.669
Mr Collins will turn us
out before he is cold.

960
01:33:15.843 --> 01:33:19.757
Do not be so alarmed. Our uncle
is in London helping in the search.

961
01:33:19.971 --> 01:33:25.178
Lydia must know what this
must be doing to my nerves.

962
01:33:25.393 --> 01:33:30.599
Such flutterings
and spasms all over me!

963
01:33:32.482 --> 01:33:36.313
My baby Lydia, my baby!

964
01:33:36.527 --> 01:33:41.022
How could she do such a
thing to her poor mama?

965
01:33:42.157 --> 01:33:44.612
- You can't do that!
- Don't be such a baby.

966
01:33:44.826 --> 01:33:47.495
- Kitty, give it to me.
- Who's it for?

967
01:33:47.661 --> 01:33:49.286
It's addressed to Papa.

968
01:33:50.789 --> 01:33:52.781
It's in Uncle's writing.

969
01:33:53.208 --> 01:33:55.745
Papa, there's a letter.

970
01:33:55.918 --> 01:33:59.334
- Let me catch my breath.
- It's in Uncle's writing.

971
01:34:03.884 --> 01:34:06.090
- He's found them.
- Are they married?

972
01:34:06.261 --> 01:34:08.716
- I can't make out his script.
- Give it to me.

973
01:34:08.930 --> 01:34:10.174
Are they married?

974
01:34:10.347 --> 01:34:14.890
They will be if Father settles 100 Pounds
a year on her. That is his condition.

975
01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:17.894
- You will agree to this, Father?
- Of course.

976
01:34:18.062 --> 01:34:22.439
God knows how much your uncle
must've laid on that wretched man.

977
01:34:22.650 --> 01:34:23.812
What do you mean?

978
01:34:23.984 --> 01:34:25.857
No man would marry Lydia

979
01:34:26.069 --> 01:34:30.232
under so slight a
temptation as 100 a year.

980
01:34:30.406 --> 01:34:33.075
Your uncle must've been very generous.

981
01:34:33.993 --> 01:34:36.364
Do you think it a large sum?

982
01:34:36.536 --> 01:34:39.703
Wickham's a fool if he
accepts less than 10,000.

983
01:34:39.914 --> 01:34:42.701
- Heaven forbid!
- Father!

984
01:34:44.335 --> 01:34:48.795
Lydia married and at 15 too!

985
01:34:49.005 --> 01:34:50.879
Ring the bell, Kitty.

986
01:34:51.090 --> 01:34:55.550
I must put on my things and tell
Lady Lucas. Oh, to see her face.

987
01:34:55.761 --> 01:34:58.465
Tell the servants they
will have a bowl of punch.

988
01:34:58.638 --> 01:35:01.425
- We should thank our uncle.
- So he should help.

989
01:35:01.599 --> 01:35:05.098
He's far richer than us and has
no children. Daughter married!

990
01:35:05.269 --> 01:35:07.226
Is that really all you think about?

991
01:35:07.396 --> 01:35:11.310
When you have five daughters,
tell me what else will occupy your thoughts.

992
01:35:11.524 --> 01:35:13.315
Then perhaps you'll understand.

993
01:35:14.652 --> 01:35:17.487
You don't know what he's like.

994
01:35:18.447 --> 01:35:21.068
- Lydia!
- Oh, Mama!

995
01:35:25.244 --> 01:35:27.201
We passed Sarah Sims in her carriage.

996
01:35:27.413 --> 01:35:31.244
So I took off my glove
so she might see the ring.

997
01:35:31.458 --> 01:35:34.375
Then I bowed and
smiled like anything...

998
01:35:34.544 --> 01:35:39.170
I'm sure she was not half
as radiant as you, my dear.

999
01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:41.462
You must all go to Brighton.

1000
01:35:41.675 --> 01:35:45.257
That is the place to get husbands.
I hope you have half my good luck.

1001
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:46.928
Lydia.

1002
01:35:47.096 --> 01:35:51.307
I want to hear every
little detail, Lydia, dear.

1003
01:35:51.475 --> 01:35:54.475
I've been enlisted in a
regiment in the North of England.

1004
01:35:54.644 --> 01:35:56.269
Glad to hear it.

1005
01:35:56.438 --> 01:35:59.687
Near Newcastle.
We travel there next week.

1006
01:35:59.857 --> 01:36:03.901
- Can I come and stay with you?
- That is out of the question.

1007
01:36:04.069 --> 01:36:06.904
Monday morning came
and I was in such a fuss.

1008
01:36:07.072 --> 01:36:08.234
I don't want to hear.

1009
01:36:08.406 --> 01:36:11.988
There was my aunt preaching
away as if reading a sermon.

1010
01:36:12.201 --> 01:36:15.866
- She was horrid unpleasant.
- Can't you understand why?

1011
01:36:16.079 --> 01:36:20.326
But I didn't hear a word because
I was thinking of my dear Wickham.

1012
01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:23.169
I longed to know if he'd
be married in his bluecoat.

1013
01:36:23.335 --> 01:36:27.878
The North of England, I believe,
boasts some spectacular scenery.

1014
01:36:28.048 --> 01:36:31.879
So I thought, who is to be our
best man if he doesn't come back?

1015
01:36:32.093 --> 01:36:35.675
Lucky, he did, or I would've
had to ask Mr Darcy.

1016
01:36:35.846 --> 01:36:40.223
- Mr Darcy!
- I forgot!

1017
01:36:40.392 --> 01:36:43.807
- But I shouldn't have said a word.
- Mr Darcy was at your wedding?

1018
01:36:43.978 --> 01:36:46.895
He was the one that discovered us.

1019
01:36:47.064 --> 01:36:51.855
He paid for the wedding,
Wickham's commission, everything.

1020
01:36:52.068 --> 01:36:53.942
But he told me not to tell.

1021
01:36:55.112 --> 01:36:57.568
- Mr Darcy?
- Stop it, Lizzie.

1022
01:36:58.699 --> 01:37:02.743
Mr Darcy's not half as high
and mighty as you sometimes.

1023
01:37:08.374 --> 01:37:11.458
Kitty, have you seen my ring?

1024
01:37:11.668 --> 01:37:13.791
Write to me often, my dear.

1025
01:37:14.003 --> 01:37:17.087
Married women never have
much time for writing.

1026
01:37:17.256 --> 01:37:19.130
I dare say you won't.

1027
01:37:19.341 --> 01:37:24.299
When I married your father, there didn't
seem to be enough hours in the day.

1028
01:37:25.972 --> 01:37:30.847
My sisters may write to me,
for they'll have nothing else to do.

1029
01:37:37.982 --> 01:37:42.026
There's nothing so bad as
parting with one's children.

1030
01:37:43.028 --> 01:37:46.860
One seems so forlorn without them.

1031
01:37:51.285 --> 01:37:56.409
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Lydia. Goodbye, Mr Wickham.

1032
01:37:58.041 --> 01:38:00.662
Bye, Kitty. Bye, Papa.

1033
01:38:06.590 --> 01:38:09.756
I can't imagine what your
father does with all that ink.

1034
01:38:09.968 --> 01:38:11.841
Mrs Bennet.

1035
01:38:12.929 --> 01:38:17.637
Did you hear the news, madam?
Mr Bingley is returning to Netherfield.

1036
01:38:17.808 --> 01:38:21.935
Mrs Nichols is ordering a haunch
of pork. She expects him tomorrow.

1037
01:38:22.103 --> 01:38:24.475
Tomorrow?

1038
01:38:24.689 --> 01:38:27.226
Not that I care.
Mr Bingley's nothing to us.

1039
01:38:27.441 --> 01:38:30.690
I'm sure I never want
to see him again, no.

1040
01:38:30.860 --> 01:38:35.237
We shan't mention a word about it.
Is it quite certain he's coming?

1041
01:38:35.448 --> 01:38:40.323
Yes, madam. I believe he's alone.
His sister remains in town.

1042
01:38:42.329 --> 01:38:47.286
Why he thinks we should be interested,
I've no idea. Come along, girls.

1043
01:38:48.250 --> 01:38:52.543
We better go home at
once and tell Mr Bennet.

1044
01:38:52.712 --> 01:38:56.626
The impudence of the man.
I wonder he dare show his face.

1045
01:38:56.799 --> 01:38:58.838
It's all right, Lizzie.

1046
01:38:59.009 --> 01:39:02.010
I'm just glad he's alone
because we shall see less of him.

1047
01:39:02.179 --> 01:39:06.472
Not that I'm afraid of myself.
But I dread other people's remarks.

1048
01:39:06.683 --> 01:39:08.307
Oh, I'm sorry.

1049
01:39:42.630 --> 01:39:44.918
He's here. He's here.
He's at the door.

1050
01:39:46.049 --> 01:39:49.133
- Mr Bingley!
- Mr Bingley?

1051
01:39:49.302 --> 01:39:52.303
Oh, my goodness!
Everybody behave naturally.

1052
01:39:52.513 --> 01:39:55.134
And whatever you do,
do not appear overbearing.

1053
01:39:55.307 --> 01:39:58.889
There's someone with him.
Mr Whatsisname, the pompous one.

1054
01:39:59.102 --> 01:40:03.728
Mr Darcy? The insolence of it.
What does he think of, coming here?

1055
01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:08.814
Keep still, Jane. Mary, put that away
at once. Find some useful employment.

1056
01:40:10.195 --> 01:40:13.859
Oh, my Lord, I shall have
a seizure, I'm sure I shall.

1057
01:40:14.031 --> 01:40:15.988
Kitty.

1058
01:40:16.158 --> 01:40:20.405
- We can't have this here.
- Mary, the ribbons, the ribbons.

1059
01:40:21.997 --> 01:40:26.622
Mary, sit down at once. Mary!

1060
01:40:30.337 --> 01:40:34.797
Mr Darcy and Mr Bingley, ma'am.

1061
01:40:45.642 --> 01:40:48.346
How glad we are to
see you, Mr Bingley.

1062
01:40:48.519 --> 01:40:51.188
There have been many
changes since you went away.

1063
01:40:51.355 --> 01:40:56.312
Miss Lucas is married and settled.
And one of my own daughters too.

1064
01:40:56.484 --> 01:40:58.358
You will have seen it in the papers,

1065
01:40:58.569 --> 01:41:01.107
though it was not put in
as it ought to have been.

1066
01:41:01.322 --> 01:41:04.986
Very short. Nothing about her family.

1067
01:41:05.158 --> 01:41:07.993
Yes, I did hear of it.
I offer my congratulations.

1068
01:41:08.161 --> 01:41:11.576
But it is very hard to have
my Lydia taken away from me.

1069
01:41:11.789 --> 01:41:15.833
Mr Wickham has been transferred
to Newcastle, wherever that is.

1070
01:41:16.001 --> 01:41:17.874
Will you stay long in the country?

1071
01:41:18.086 --> 01:41:20.292
Just a few weeks.
For the shooting.

1072
01:41:20.505 --> 01:41:22.544
When you've killed all your own birds,

1073
01:41:22.715 --> 01:41:25.799
I beg you will come here and
shoot as many as you please.

1074
01:41:25.968 --> 01:41:30.510
Mr Bennet will be vastly happy to oblige
and will save the best coveys for you.

1075
01:41:30.722 --> 01:41:33.177
Excellent.

1076
01:41:33.349 --> 01:41:37.263
- Are you well, Mr Darcy?
- Quite well, thank you.

1077
01:41:37.436 --> 01:41:39.807
I hope the weather
stays fine for your sport.

1078
01:41:39.979 --> 01:41:43.478
- I return to town tomorrow.
- So soon?

1079
01:41:45.151 --> 01:41:49.693
My Jane looks well, does she not?

1080
01:41:51.531 --> 01:41:53.654
She does indeed.

1081
01:42:01.039 --> 01:42:03.790
Well, we must be going, I think.

1082
01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:08.165
Darcy. It's been very
pleasant to see you all again.

1083
01:42:08.379 --> 01:42:10.335
Miss Elizabeth. Miss Bennet.

1084
01:42:10.547 --> 01:42:11.922
You must come again.

1085
01:42:12.090 --> 01:42:15.589
Last winter, you promised
to have a family dinner with us.

1086
01:42:15.802 --> 01:42:20.593
I've not forgot, you see.
At least three courses.

1087
01:42:26.394 --> 01:42:28.102
Excuse me.

1088
01:42:33.942 --> 01:42:36.777
Most extraordinary.

1089
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:51.286
We were going to walk in and
she was going to say, "Sit down."

1090
01:42:51.499 --> 01:42:53.538
So, I feel...

1091
01:43:04.009 --> 01:43:05.800
Oh, it's a disaster, isn't it?

1092
01:43:06.011 --> 01:43:07.968
It's been...

1093
01:43:10.431 --> 01:43:12.554
- Miss Bennet.
- Mr Bingley.

1094
01:43:12.767 --> 01:43:15.553
I'll just go in and I'll just say it.

1095
01:43:15.727 --> 01:43:18.016
Yes, exactly.

1096
01:43:22.692 --> 01:43:26.440
I'm glad that's over. Now we can
meet as indifferent acquaintances.

1097
01:43:26.612 --> 01:43:27.607
Oh, yes.

1098
01:43:27.821 --> 01:43:30.905
You cannot think me so weak
as to be in danger now.

1099
01:43:31.116 --> 01:43:34.947
You are in great danger of making
him as much in love with you as ever.

1100
01:43:36.745 --> 01:43:41.288
- I'm sorry he came with Mr Darcy.
- Don't say that.

1101
01:43:42.625 --> 01:43:43.704
Why ever not?

1102
01:43:46.545 --> 01:43:49.629
Jane.

1103
01:43:49.798 --> 01:43:54.673
- I've been so blind.
- What do you mean?

1104
01:43:54.886 --> 01:43:57.637
Look, it's him.
He's back. He's come again.

1105
01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:07.977
I know this is all very untoward,

1106
01:44:08.189 --> 01:44:12.400
but I would like to request the
privilege of speaking to Miss Bennet.

1107
01:44:13.527 --> 01:44:15.733
Alone.

1108
01:44:17.321 --> 01:44:20.571
Everybody to the kitchen immediately.

1109
01:44:20.741 --> 01:44:24.785
Except you, Jane, dear, of course.

1110
01:44:26.746 --> 01:44:31.787
Oh, Mr Bingley, it's so good
to see you again so soon.

1111
01:44:51.851 --> 01:44:56.642
First, I must tell you I've been the
most unmitigated and comprehensive ass.

1112
01:45:15.162 --> 01:45:16.621
Kitty, be quiet.

1113
01:45:29.007 --> 01:45:31.463
Yes.

1114
01:45:31.635 --> 01:45:33.923
A thousand times yes.

1115
01:45:39.266 --> 01:45:42.765
Thank the Lord for that.
I thought it would never happen.

1116
01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:33.477
I am confident they
will do well together.

1117
01:46:33.646 --> 01:46:37.643
Their tempers are much alike.

1118
01:46:38.733 --> 01:46:42.647
They will be cheated
assiduously by their servants.

1119
01:46:42.862 --> 01:46:49.030
And be so generous with the rest,
they will always exceed their income.

1120
01:46:49.242 --> 01:46:53.785
Exceed their income?
He has 5,000 a year.

1121
01:46:57.749 --> 01:47:01.248
I knew she did not be
so beautiful for nothing.

1122
01:47:09.635 --> 01:47:12.090
"...must be free from all insincerity.

1123
01:47:12.262 --> 01:47:15.926
She only can address herself
effectually to the feelings of others

1124
01:47:16.140 --> 01:47:19.390
whose mind glows with
the warmth of sensibility

1125
01:47:19.601 --> 01:47:22.353
and whose arguments
result from conviction.

1126
01:47:22.521 --> 01:47:26.019
She must feel the influence
of those passions and emotions

1127
01:47:26.232 --> 01:47:29.398
which she wishes to inspire..."

1128
01:47:50.169 --> 01:47:52.457
Can you die of happiness?

1129
01:47:54.047 --> 01:47:57.048
He was ignorant of my
being in town in the spring.

1130
01:47:57.217 --> 01:48:00.301
- How did he account for it?
- He thought me indifferent.

1131
01:48:00.469 --> 01:48:04.217
- Unfathomable.
- No doubt poisoned by his sister.

1132
01:48:04.389 --> 01:48:09.975
Bravo. That's the most unforgiving
speech you've ever made.

1133
01:48:10.144 --> 01:48:12.350
Oh, Lizzie, if I could
but see you so happy.

1134
01:48:12.563 --> 01:48:14.851
If there was such a man for you.

1135
01:48:18.610 --> 01:48:21.859
Perhaps Mr Collins has a cousin.

1136
01:48:24.615 --> 01:48:26.488
- What is that?
- What?

1137
01:48:26.658 --> 01:48:29.742
Maybe he's changed his mind.

1138
01:48:31.955 --> 01:48:34.077
Coming!

1139
01:48:37.167 --> 01:48:38.578
Yes.

1140
01:48:40.587 --> 01:48:42.626
Lady Catherine.

1141
01:48:48.302 --> 01:48:51.219
The rest of your offspring,
I presume?

1142
01:48:51.388 --> 01:48:55.136
All but one. The youngest has
been lately married, your Ladyship.

1143
01:48:55.308 --> 01:48:58.261
My eldest was proposed
to only this afternoon.

1144
01:49:00.145 --> 01:49:04.142
- You have a very small garden.
- Could I offer you a cup of tea?

1145
01:49:04.315 --> 01:49:07.731
Absolutely not. I need to speak
to Miss Elizabeth Bennet alone.

1146
01:49:08.569 --> 01:49:10.775
As a matter of urgency.

1147
01:49:14.741 --> 01:49:18.074
You can be at no loss to
understand why I am here.

1148
01:49:18.244 --> 01:49:20.532
I cannot account for this honour at all.

1149
01:49:20.746 --> 01:49:24.957
I warn you,
I am not to be trifled with.

1150
01:49:25.125 --> 01:49:27.496
A most alarming report
has reached me.

1151
01:49:27.669 --> 01:49:32.211
That you intend to be united
with my nephew, Mr Darcy.

1152
01:49:32.381 --> 01:49:35.963
I know this to be a falsehood.
Though not wishing to injure him

1153
01:49:36.176 --> 01:49:40.089
by supposing it possible, I instantly
set off to make my sentiments known.

1154
01:49:40.263 --> 01:49:43.346
If you believed it impossible,
I wonder that you came so far.

1155
01:49:43.557 --> 01:49:44.885
To hear it contradicted.

1156
01:49:45.058 --> 01:49:48.474
Your coming will be a
confirmation if such a report exists.

1157
01:49:48.686 --> 01:49:51.936
If? You pretend to be ignorant of it?

1158
01:49:52.106 --> 01:49:55.106
Has it not been industriously
circulated by yourself?

1159
01:49:55.275 --> 01:49:57.149
I have never heard of it.

1160
01:49:57.360 --> 01:49:59.732
Can you declare there
is no foundation for it?

1161
01:49:59.946 --> 01:50:03.445
I do not pretend to possess
equal frankness with your Ladyship.

1162
01:50:03.616 --> 01:50:06.700
You may ask a question which
I may choose not to answer.

1163
01:50:06.910 --> 01:50:09.199
Has my nephew made
you an offer of marriage?

1164
01:50:09.371 --> 01:50:12.454
Your Ladyship has
declared it to be impossible.

1165
01:50:12.623 --> 01:50:16.206
Mr Darcy is engaged to my daughter.
Now what have you to say?

1166
01:50:16.377 --> 01:50:20.125
If that is the case, you cannot
suppose he would make an offer to me.

1167
01:50:20.297 --> 01:50:25.421
Selfish girl. This union has been
planned since their infancy.

1168
01:50:25.634 --> 01:50:28.967
Do you think it can be prevented
by a woman of inferior birth

1169
01:50:29.179 --> 01:50:33.639
whose own sister's elopement resulted
in a scandalously patched-up marriage

1170
01:50:33.850 --> 01:50:37.099
only achieved at the
expense of your uncle.

1171
01:50:37.269 --> 01:50:41.183
Heaven and Earth! Are the shades
of Pemberley to be thus polluted?

1172
01:50:41.356 --> 01:50:43.894
Tell me once and for all,
are you engaged to him?

1173
01:50:47.361 --> 01:50:49.567
I am not.

1174
01:50:50.447 --> 01:50:53.401
Will you promise never to
enter into such an engagement?

1175
01:50:53.575 --> 01:50:55.781
I will not and I certainly never shall.

1176
01:50:57.662 --> 01:50:59.950
You have insulted me
in every possible way

1177
01:51:00.164 --> 01:51:02.915
and can now have
nothing further to say.

1178
01:51:04.209 --> 01:51:06.913
I must ask you to leave immediately.

1179
01:51:09.213 --> 01:51:10.541
Goodnight.

1180
01:51:12.549 --> 01:51:16.297
I have never been thus
treated in my entire life!

1181
01:51:17.512 --> 01:51:21.011
- What is going on?
- Just a small misunderstanding.

1182
01:51:21.182 --> 01:51:24.431
For once in your life,
leave me alone!

1183
01:54:13.953 --> 01:54:16.788
- I couldn't sleep.
- Nor I. My aunt...

1184
01:54:16.956 --> 01:54:20.122
Yes, she was here.

1185
01:54:20.292 --> 01:54:23.458
How can I ever make
amends for such behaviour?

1186
01:54:23.628 --> 01:54:26.000
After what you've done for Lydia

1187
01:54:26.172 --> 01:54:29.505
and, I suspect, for Jane,
it is I who should be making amends.

1188
01:54:30.759 --> 01:54:35.634
You must know.
Surely you must know it was all for you.

1189
01:54:38.099 --> 01:54:41.265
You are too generous to trifle with me.

1190
01:54:41.435 --> 01:54:44.851
You spoke with my aunt last night
and it has taught me to hope

1191
01:54:45.021 --> 01:54:47.726
as I'd scarcely allowed myself before.

1192
01:54:49.192 --> 01:54:54.232
If your feelings are still what they
were last April, tell me so at once.

1193
01:54:54.404 --> 01:54:57.405
My affections and wishes
have not changed.

1194
01:54:57.616 --> 01:55:00.782
But one word from you
will silence me for ever.

1195
01:55:05.998 --> 01:55:10.291
If, however,
your feelings have changed...

1196
01:55:13.087 --> 01:55:15.293
...I would have to tell you,

1197
01:55:15.506 --> 01:55:18.340
you have bewitched me,
body and soul, and I love...

1198
01:55:18.508 --> 01:55:21.592
I love... I love you.

1199
01:55:21.761 --> 01:55:24.715
I never wish to be parted
from you from this day on.

1200
01:55:36.398 --> 01:55:38.106
Well, then.

1201
01:55:43.029 --> 01:55:45.698
Your hands are cold.

1202
01:56:30.027 --> 01:56:31.984
Shut the door, please.

1203
01:56:42.913 --> 01:56:48.417
Lizzie, are you out of your senses?
I thought you hated the man.

1204
01:56:48.585 --> 01:56:53.626
- No, Papa.
- He is rich, to be sure.

1205
01:56:53.839 --> 01:56:57.671
And you will have more
fine carriages than Jane.

1206
01:56:57.843 --> 01:57:00.298
But will that make you happy?

1207
01:57:00.512 --> 01:57:04.591
Have you no other objection
than your belief in my indifference?

1208
01:57:04.765 --> 01:57:06.971
None at all.

1209
01:57:07.142 --> 01:57:12.017
We all know him to be a proud,
unpleasant sort of fellow.

1210
01:57:12.230 --> 01:57:14.602
But this would be
nothing if you liked him.

1211
01:57:14.774 --> 01:57:16.481
I do like him.

1212
01:57:18.902 --> 01:57:20.444
I love him.

1213
01:57:23.573 --> 01:57:28.281
He's not proud. I was wrong.
I was entirely wrong about him.

1214
01:57:31.663 --> 01:57:34.996
You don't know him, Papa.
If I told you what he was really like,

1215
01:57:35.208 --> 01:57:36.370
what he's done...

1216
01:57:37.376 --> 01:57:39.416
What has he done?

1217
01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:51.258
But she doesn't like him.
I thought she didn't like him.

1218
01:57:51.472 --> 01:57:55.136
So did I. So did we all.

1219
01:57:55.308 --> 01:57:58.013
We must have been wrong.

1220
01:57:58.186 --> 01:58:03.725
- It won't be the first time, will it?
- No, nor the last, I dare say.

1221
01:58:09.237 --> 01:58:11.028
Good Lord.

1222
01:58:13.657 --> 01:58:17.701
- I must pay him back.
- No.

1223
01:58:17.869 --> 01:58:21.451
You mustn't tell anyone.
He wouldn't want it.

1224
01:58:21.664 --> 01:58:25.957
We misjudged him, Papa.
Me more than anyone. In every way.

1225
01:58:26.168 --> 01:58:29.501
Not just in this matter.

1226
01:58:29.671 --> 01:58:32.340
I've been nonsensical.

1227
01:58:32.506 --> 01:58:37.464
But he's been a fool about Jane,
about so many other things.

1228
01:58:37.678 --> 01:58:41.093
But then, so have I.

1229
01:58:44.016 --> 01:58:46.768
You see, he and I are...

1230
01:58:49.020 --> 01:58:52.187
He and I are so similar.

1231
01:58:52.398 --> 01:58:55.731
We're both so stubborn.

1232
01:58:57.403 --> 01:58:59.110
Papa, I...

1233
01:59:03.074 --> 01:59:05.446
You really do love him, don't you?

1234
01:59:06.911 --> 01:59:09.199
Very much.

1235
01:59:13.625 --> 01:59:19.378
I cannot believe that
anyone can deserve you.

1236
01:59:19.546 --> 01:59:23.757
But it seems I am overruled.

1237
01:59:23.925 --> 01:59:28.551
So I heartily give my consent.

1238
01:59:36.936 --> 01:59:41.811
I could not have parted with you,
my Lizzie, to anyone less worthy.

1239
01:59:45.152 --> 01:59:46.147
Thank you.

1240
02:00:00.123 --> 02:00:04.748
If any young men come for Mary or Kitty,
for heaven's sake, send them in.

1241
02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:07.498
I'm quite at my leisure.
