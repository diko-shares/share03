2
00:02:11.834 --> 00:02:13.873
Lydia! Kitty!

3
00:02:50.372 --> 00:02:53.159
My dear Mr Bennet, have you heard?

4
00:02:53.334 --> 00:02:58.042
Netherfield Park is let at last. Do you
not want to know who has taken it?

5
00:02:58.255 --> 00:03:04.258
As you wish to tell me, my dear,
I doubt I have any choice in the matter.

6
00:03:09.975 --> 00:03:13.142
Kitty, what have I told you
about listening at the door?

7
00:03:13.354 --> 00:03:16.141
There's a Mr Bingley
arrived from the North.

8
00:03:16.315 --> 00:03:19.565
- Five thousand a year!
- Really?

9
00:03:19.735 --> 00:03:21.359
- He's single!
- Who's single?

10
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.239
A Mr Bingley, apparently. Kitty!

11
00:03:24.406 --> 00:03:26.280
How can that possibly affect them?

12
00:03:26.492 --> 00:03:28.615
Mr Bennet,
how can you be so tiresome?

13
00:03:28.786 --> 00:03:31.158
You know he must marry one of them.

14
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.369
That is his design in settling here?

15
00:03:33.582 --> 00:03:35.788
You must go and visit him at once.

16
00:03:36.001 --> 00:03:38.919
Good heavens. People.

17
00:03:41.382 --> 00:03:45.462
For we may not visit if you do not,
as you well know, Mr Bennet.

18
00:03:45.636 --> 00:03:49.847
- Are you listening? You never listen.
- You must, Papa! At once!

19
00:03:50.015 --> 00:03:52.553
There's no need. I already have.

20
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.184
- You have?
- When?

21
00:03:55.354 --> 00:03:58.937
Oh, Mr Bennet,
how can you tease me so?

22
00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:01.521
Have you no compassion
for my poor nerves?

23
00:04:01.735 --> 00:04:05.318
You mistake me, my dear.
I have the highest respect for them.

24
00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:08.781
They've been my constant companions
these twenty years.

25
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:09.947
Papa!

26
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.405
- Is he amiable?
- Who?

27
00:04:11.578 --> 00:04:13.951
- Is he handsome?
- He's sure to be.

28
00:04:14.164 --> 00:04:17.331
With 5,000 a year,
it would not matter if he had warts.

29
00:04:17.501 --> 00:04:18.876
Who's got warts?

30
00:04:19.044 --> 00:04:22.294
I will consent to
his marrying whichever girl he chooses.

31
00:04:22.506 --> 00:04:26.718
- So will he come to the ball tomorrow?
- I believe so.

32
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.802
- Mr Bennet!
- I have to have your muslin!

33
00:04:31.974 --> 00:04:34.809
- I'll lend you my green slippers!
- They were mine.

34
00:04:34.977 --> 00:04:38.725
- I'll do your mending for a week.
- I'll retrim your new bonnet.

35
00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:40.647
Two weeks I'll do it for.

36
00:05:19.063 --> 00:05:22.229
It's not the same!
It's not the same.

37
00:05:32.326 --> 00:05:34.283
I can't breathe.

38
00:05:37.122 --> 00:05:39.827
I think one of
my toes just came off.

39
00:05:47.966 --> 00:05:50.967
If every man does not end the evening
in love with you,

40
00:05:51.136 --> 00:05:52.928
then I'm no judge of beauty.

41
00:05:53.138 --> 00:05:56.139
- Or men.
- No, they are far too easy to judge.

42
00:05:56.308 --> 00:05:57.850
They're not all bad.

43
00:05:58.018 --> 00:06:00.889
Humourless poppycocks,
in my limited experience.

44
00:06:01.063 --> 00:06:03.352
One day,
someone will catch your eye,

45
00:06:03.565 --> 00:06:05.938
and then you'll have
to watch your tongue.

46
00:06:27.172 --> 00:06:28.417
How good of you to come.

47
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.260
Which of the painted peacocks
is our Mr Bingley?

48
00:06:31.427 --> 00:06:34.178
He's on the right.
On the left is his sister.

49
00:06:34.346 --> 00:06:39.388
- The person with the quizzical brow?
- That is his good friend, Mr Darcy.

50
00:06:39.601 --> 00:06:43.979
- He looks miserable, poor soul.
- He may be, but poor he is not.

51
00:06:44.148 --> 00:06:45.143
Tell me.

52
00:06:45.357 --> 00:06:48.109
10,000 a year,
and he owns half of Derbyshire.

53
00:06:48.277 --> 00:06:50.316
The miserable half.

54
00:07:17.723 --> 00:07:22.599
Mr Bennet, you must introduce him
to the girls immediately.

55
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.312
Smile at Mr Bingley. Smile.

56
00:07:41.872 --> 00:07:42.868
Mary.

57
00:07:43.082 --> 00:07:45.999
Mr Bingley, my eldest daughter you know.

58
00:07:47.127 --> 00:07:51.588
Mrs Bennet, Miss Jane Bennet,
Elizabeth and Miss Mary Bennet.

59
00:07:51.757 --> 00:07:55.505
It is a pleasure. I have two others,
but they're already dancing.

60
00:07:55.678 --> 00:07:58.050
I'm delighted to make your acquaintance.

61
00:07:58.263 --> 00:08:03.554
And may I introduce Mr Darcy
of Pemberley in Derbyshire.

62
00:08:23.205 --> 00:08:25.411
How do you like it
here in Hertfordshire?

63
00:08:25.624 --> 00:08:27.581
Very much.

64
00:08:27.751 --> 00:08:31.085
The library at Netherfield,
I've heard, is one of the finest.

65
00:08:31.255 --> 00:08:35.715
It fills me with guilt. I'm not a good
reader. I prefer being out of doors.

66
00:08:35.926 --> 00:08:38.464
Oh, I mean, I can read, of course.

67
00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:42.095
And I'm not suggesting
you can't read out of doors.

68
00:08:42.266 --> 00:08:46.014
I wish I read more, but there
seem to be so many other things to do.

69
00:08:46.186 --> 00:08:48.475
That's exactly what I meant.

70
00:08:51.608 --> 00:08:55.523
Mama, Mama! You will never, ever believe
what we're about to tell you.

71
00:08:55.696 --> 00:08:58.317
- Tell me!
- She's going to take the veil.

72
00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:00.863
- The regiment are coming!
- Officers?

73
00:09:01.035 --> 00:09:04.285
They're going to be stationed
the whole winter, right here.

74
00:09:04.455 --> 00:09:06.993
- Officers?
- As far as the eye can see.

75
00:09:13.464 --> 00:09:17.378
Oh, look.
Jane's dancing with Mr Bingley.

76
00:09:17.551 --> 00:09:19.045
Mr Bennet.

77
00:09:33.233 --> 00:09:37.314
- Do you dance, Mr Darcy?
- Not if I can help it.

78
00:09:56.215 --> 00:09:59.299
I didn't know you were coming
to see me. What's the matter?

79
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:05.180
We are a long way from Grosvenor Square,
are we not, Mr Darcy?

80
00:10:05.349 --> 00:10:07.555
I've never seen so many pretty girls.

81
00:10:07.768 --> 00:10:10.224
You were dancing
with the only handsome girl.

82
00:10:10.396 --> 00:10:13.396
She is the most beautiful creature
I have ever beheld.

83
00:10:13.565 --> 00:10:17.943
- But her sister Elizabeth is agreeable.
- Perfectly tolerable.

84
00:10:18.112 --> 00:10:22.406
Not handsome enough to tempt me. Return
to your partner and enjoy her smiles.

85
00:10:22.574 --> 00:10:25.030
You're wasting your time with me.

86
00:10:28.998 --> 00:10:33.541
Count your blessings, Lizzie. If he
liked you, you'd have to talk to him.

87
00:10:33.752 --> 00:10:34.997
Precisely.

88
00:10:35.212 --> 00:10:37.917
I wouldn't dance with him
for all of Derbyshire,

89
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:40.462
let alone the miserable half.

90
00:11:43.113 --> 00:11:44.572
Wait!

91
00:12:01.507 --> 00:12:07.011
- I enjoyed that so much, Miss Lucas.
- How well you dance, Mr Bingley.

92
00:12:07.179 --> 00:12:09.468
I've never enjoyed a dance so much.

93
00:12:09.682 --> 00:12:12.517
My daughter Jane
is a splendid dancer, is she not?

94
00:12:12.685 --> 00:12:14.642
She is indeed.

95
00:12:15.604 --> 00:12:18.854
Your friend Miss Lucas
is a most amusing young woman.

96
00:12:19.024 --> 00:12:20.732
Oh, yes, I adore her.

97
00:12:20.901 --> 00:12:25.065
- It is a pity she's not more handsome.
- Mama!

98
00:12:25.239 --> 00:12:28.738
Oh, but Lizzie
would never admit that she's plain.

99
00:12:28.909 --> 00:12:33.156
Of course, it's my Jane who's considered
the beauty of the county.

100
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:34.326
Mama, please!

101
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.624
When she was 15, a gentleman
was so much in love with her,

102
00:12:37.793 --> 00:12:39.999
I was sure he would make her an offer.

103
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:43.753
However, he did write her
some very pretty verses.

104
00:12:43.924 --> 00:12:45.169
And that put paid to it.

105
00:12:45.342 --> 00:12:48.758
I wonder who discovered the power
of poetry in driving away love.

106
00:12:48.971 --> 00:12:52.304
- I thought poetry was the food of love.
- Of a fine, stout love.

107
00:12:52.474 --> 00:12:55.974
But if it is only a vague inclination,
one poor sonnet will kill it.

108
00:12:56.186 --> 00:12:59.187
So, what do you recommend
to encourage affection?

109
00:13:00.149 --> 00:13:06.152
Dancing. Even if one's partner
is barely tolerable.

110
00:13:28.594 --> 00:13:32.093
Mr Bingley is just what
a young man ought to be.

111
00:13:32.264 --> 00:13:35.763
- Sensible, good-humoured...
- Handsome, conveniently rich...

112
00:13:35.934 --> 00:13:38.770
Marriage should not be driven
by thoughts of money.

113
00:13:38.937 --> 00:13:41.144
Only deep love
will persuade me to marry.

114
00:13:41.357 --> 00:13:45.983
- Which is why I'll end up an old maid.
- Do you really believe he liked me?

115
00:13:46.153 --> 00:13:49.652
He danced with you most of the night,
and stared at you the rest.

116
00:13:49.823 --> 00:13:52.824
I give you leave to like him.
You've liked many stupider.

117
00:13:53.035 --> 00:13:56.285
You're a great deal too apt
to like people in general.

118
00:13:56.455 --> 00:13:58.412
All the world
is good in your eyes.

119
00:13:58.624 --> 00:14:01.874
Not his friend. I still can't believe
what he said about you.

120
00:14:02.086 --> 00:14:04.458
Mr Darcy?

121
00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:09.422
I'd more easily forgive his vanity
had he not wounded mine.

122
00:14:09.593 --> 00:14:12.380
But no matter.
I doubt we shall ever speak again.

123
00:14:43.919 --> 00:14:46.042
He danced with Miss Lucas.

124
00:14:46.213 --> 00:14:48.087
We were all there, dear.

125
00:14:48.257 --> 00:14:50.380
It is a shame she's not more handsome.

126
00:14:50.551 --> 00:14:53.302
There's a spinster
in the making and no mistake.

127
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:56.140
The fourth with a Miss King
of little standing,

128
00:14:56.306 --> 00:14:58.429
and the fifth again with Jane.

129
00:14:58.642 --> 00:15:01.892
If he had any compassion,
he would've sprained his ankle.

130
00:15:02.062 --> 00:15:03.225
The way you carry on,

131
00:15:03.397 --> 00:15:06.481
you'd think our girls look forward
to a grand inheritance.

132
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:08.939
When you die,
which may be very soon,

133
00:15:09.111 --> 00:15:13.654
they will be left without a roof over
their head nor a penny to their name.

134
00:15:13.824 --> 00:15:17.407
- Please, it's ten in the morning.
- A letter to Miss Bennet, ma'am.

135
00:15:17.578 --> 00:15:21.077
From Netherfield Hall.

136
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.955
Praise the Lord. We are saved!

137
00:15:25.169 --> 00:15:30.127
Make haste, Jane,
make haste. Oh, happy day!

138
00:15:31.633 --> 00:15:34.171
It is from Caroline Bingley.

139
00:15:34.386 --> 00:15:39.095
She has invited me to dine with her.

140
00:15:39.266 --> 00:15:42.350
- Her brother will be dining out.
- Dining out?

141
00:15:42.519 --> 00:15:44.477
- Can I take the carriage?
- Let me see.

142
00:15:44.688 --> 00:15:48.353
- It is too far to walk.
- This is unaccountable of him.

143
00:15:48.567 --> 00:15:50.441
Mama, the carriage for Jane?

144
00:15:52.571 --> 00:15:56.154
Certainly not. She'll go on horseback.

145
00:15:56.909 --> 00:15:59.198
Horseback!

146
00:16:14.593 --> 00:16:16.384
Lizzie.

147
00:16:16.595 --> 00:16:19.929
Now she'll have to stay the night,
exactly as I predicted.

148
00:16:20.099 --> 00:16:23.265
Good grief, woman,
your skills in the art of matchmaking

149
00:16:23.435 --> 00:16:25.309
are positively occult.

150
00:16:25.479 --> 00:16:30.105
Though I don't think, Mama,
you can take credit for making it rain.

151
00:16:34.989 --> 00:16:38.488
"My friends will not hear of me
returning home until I am better.

152
00:16:38.659 --> 00:16:42.739
Excepting a sore throat, a fever and
a headache, nothing is wrong with me."

153
00:16:42.913 --> 00:16:48.120
If Jane does die it will be a comfort
to know it was in pursuit of Mr Bingley.

154
00:16:48.335 --> 00:16:50.624
People do not die of colds.

155
00:16:50.796 --> 00:16:54.212
But she may perish with the
shame of having such a mother.

156
00:16:55.342 --> 00:16:58.094
I must go to Netherfield at once.

157
00:17:11.191 --> 00:17:16.233
Lady Bathurst is redecorating
her ballroom in the French style.

158
00:17:16.447 --> 00:17:19.613
A little unpatriotic, don't you think?

159
00:17:22.077 --> 00:17:25.078
Miss Elizabeth Bennet.

160
00:17:38.802 --> 00:17:41.009
Good Lord, did you walk here?

161
00:17:41.764 --> 00:17:43.222
I did.

162
00:17:50.356 --> 00:17:54.602
- I'm so sorry. How is my sister?
- She's upstairs.

163
00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.778
Thank you.

164
00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:13.166
My goodness, did you
see her hem? Six inches deep in mud.

165
00:18:13.379 --> 00:18:15.502
She looked positively mediaeval.

166
00:18:15.673 --> 00:18:20.216
I feel such a terrible imposition.
They're being so kind to me.

167
00:18:20.386 --> 00:18:25.972
I don't know who is more pleased at your
being here, Mama or Mr Bingley.

168
00:18:31.063 --> 00:18:33.601
Thank you for tending
to my sister so diligently.

169
00:18:33.816 --> 00:18:36.104
She's in far better comfort
than at home.

170
00:18:36.276 --> 00:18:37.984
It's a pleasure.

171
00:18:38.195 --> 00:18:42.027
I mean, it's not a pleasure
that she's ill. Of course not.

172
00:18:42.241 --> 00:18:46.073
It's a pleasure that she's here,
being ill.

173
00:18:49.248 --> 00:18:51.537
Not going to be famous, our pig.

174
00:18:51.709 --> 00:18:55.042
Black on the back, but not related
to the learned pig of Norwich.

175
00:18:55.254 --> 00:18:58.338
- Now that pig is...
- Mr Bennet.

176
00:18:58.507 --> 00:19:01.841
It's all going to plan.
He's half in love with her already.

177
00:19:02.052 --> 00:19:04.259
- Who is, blossom?
- Mr Bingley.

178
00:19:04.471 --> 00:19:06.760
He doesn't mind
that she hasn't a penny.

179
00:19:06.974 --> 00:19:09.180
He has more than enough
for the two of them.

180
00:19:09.393 --> 00:19:11.350
- How will we meet them?
- Easy!

181
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.599
Wait for me!

182
00:19:12.771 --> 00:19:18.192
You drop something. They
pick it up. And then you're introduced.

183
00:19:25.826 --> 00:19:26.905
Officers!

184
00:19:59.193 --> 00:20:02.526
You write uncommonly fast, Mr Darcy.

185
00:20:02.738 --> 00:20:04.777
You're mistaken. I write slowly.

186
00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:08.573
How many letters you must have occasion
to write, Mr Darcy.

187
00:20:08.744 --> 00:20:11.615
Letters of business.
How odious I should think them.

188
00:20:11.789 --> 00:20:14.659
It is fortunate, then,
they fall to me and not you.

189
00:20:14.833 --> 00:20:17.371
Tell your sister I long to see her.

190
00:20:17.586 --> 00:20:20.920
- I've already told her once.
- I do dote on her.

191
00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:24.340
I was quite in raptures
at her beautiful design for a table.

192
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:27.760
Perhaps you will give me leave
to defer your raptures.

193
00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:30.053
I have not room enough
to do them justice.

194
00:20:30.265 --> 00:20:33.101
You young ladies are so accomplished.

195
00:20:33.268 --> 00:20:36.768
- What do you mean?
- You paint tables, play the piano

196
00:20:36.939 --> 00:20:38.350
and embroider cushions.

197
00:20:38.524 --> 00:20:41.690
I never heard of a lady,
but people say she's accomplished.

198
00:20:41.902 --> 00:20:44.108
The word is applied too liberally.

199
00:20:44.321 --> 00:20:46.444
I do not know more than
half a dozen women

200
00:20:46.615 --> 00:20:49.402
- that are truly accomplished.
- Nor I.

201
00:20:49.576 --> 00:20:52.743
Goodness, you must comprehend
a great deal in the idea.

202
00:20:52.913 --> 00:20:54.538
- I do.
- Absolutely.

203
00:20:54.748 --> 00:20:58.413
She must have a knowledge of music,
singing, drawing, dancing

204
00:20:58.585 --> 00:21:01.919
and the modern languages
to deserve the word.

205
00:21:02.131 --> 00:21:05.963
And something in her air
and manner of walking.

206
00:21:06.176 --> 00:21:09.047
And she must improve her mind
by extensive reading.

207
00:21:09.221 --> 00:21:12.970
I'm no longer surprised at your knowing
only six accomplished women.

208
00:21:13.142 --> 00:21:16.475
- I wonder at you knowing any.
- Are you so severe on your own sex?

209
00:21:16.687 --> 00:21:21.148
I never saw such a woman. She would
certainly be a fearsome thing to behold.

210
00:21:23.569 --> 00:21:27.068
Miss Elizabeth,
let us take a turn about the room.

211
00:21:44.298 --> 00:21:49.007
It's refreshing, is it not,
after sitting so long in one attitude?

212
00:21:49.219 --> 00:21:52.470
It is a small kind of accomplishment,
I suppose.

213
00:21:52.639 --> 00:21:54.846
Will you not join us, Mr Darcy?

214
00:21:55.059 --> 00:21:58.558
You can only have two motives,
and I would interfere with either.

215
00:21:58.771 --> 00:22:00.810
What can he mean?

216
00:22:00.981 --> 00:22:04.231
The surest way to disappoint him
would be to ask him nothing.

217
00:22:04.443 --> 00:22:07.195
Do tell us, Mr Darcy.

218
00:22:09.281 --> 00:22:11.570
Either you are
in each other's confidence

219
00:22:11.742 --> 00:22:13.865
and you have
secret affairs to discuss,

220
00:22:14.078 --> 00:22:16.284
or you are conscious
that your figures

221
00:22:16.497 --> 00:22:19.663
appear to the greatest
advantage by walking.

222
00:22:21.126 --> 00:22:23.913
If the first,
I should get in your way.

223
00:22:24.088 --> 00:22:27.005
If the second,
I can admire you much better from here.

224
00:22:27.174 --> 00:22:29.546
How shall we punish him
for such a speech?

225
00:22:29.718 --> 00:22:33.763
- We could laugh at him.
- No. Mr Darcy is not to be teased.

226
00:22:33.931 --> 00:22:38.640
Are you too proud, Mr Darcy? And would
you consider pride a fault or a virtue?

227
00:22:38.811 --> 00:22:41.812
- I couldn't say.
- We're trying to find a fault in you.

228
00:22:42.022 --> 00:22:45.107
I find it hard to forgive
the follies and vices of others,

229
00:22:45.275 --> 00:22:47.067
or their offences against me.

230
00:22:47.277 --> 00:22:50.777
My good opinion,
once lost, is lost forever.

231
00:22:52.741 --> 00:22:55.908
Oh, dear.
I cannot tease you about that.

232
00:22:56.078 --> 00:22:58.201
What a shame,
for I dearly love to laugh.

233
00:22:58.414 --> 00:23:00.620
A family trait, I think.

234
00:23:29.194 --> 00:23:34.615
A Mrs Bennet, a Miss Bennet,
a Miss Bennet and a Miss Bennet, sir.

235
00:23:34.783 --> 00:23:37.784
Are we to receive every
Bennet in the country?

236
00:23:40.497 --> 00:23:43.831
What an excellent room you have, sir.

237
00:23:44.001 --> 00:23:47.666
Such expensive furnishings.

238
00:23:47.838 --> 00:23:50.839
I do hope
you intend to stay here, Mr Bingley.

239
00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:55.842
Absolutely, I find the country
very diverting. Don't you agree, Darcy?

240
00:23:56.013 --> 00:23:57.721
I find it perfectly adequate.

241
00:23:57.931 --> 00:24:00.802
Even if society
is a little less varied than in town.

242
00:24:00.976 --> 00:24:02.850
Less varied? Not at all.

243
00:24:03.062 --> 00:24:07.106
We dine with four and 20 families
of all shapes and sizes.

244
00:24:07.274 --> 00:24:11.735
Sir William Lucas, for instance,
is a very agreeable man.

245
00:24:11.945 --> 00:24:15.694
And a good deal less self-important
than some people half his rank.

246
00:24:15.908 --> 00:24:19.573
Mr Bingley,
is it true you will hold a ball here?

247
00:24:19.745 --> 00:24:21.287
A ball?

248
00:24:21.455 --> 00:24:26.164
It would be an excellent way to meet new
friends. You could invite the militia.

249
00:24:26.377 --> 00:24:28.334
- Oh, do hold a ball!
- Kitty!

250
00:24:28.671 --> 00:24:31.375
When your sister recovers,
you shall name the day.

251
00:24:31.548 --> 00:24:36.091
I think a ball is an irrational way
to gain new acquaintance.

252
00:24:36.303 --> 00:24:40.431
It would be better if conversation,
not dancing, were the order of the day.

253
00:24:40.599 --> 00:24:44.727
Indeed, much more rational,
but rather less like a ball.

254
00:24:44.895 --> 00:24:46.520
Thank you, Mary.

255
00:24:47.606 --> 00:24:51.900
What a fine imposing place to be sure,
is it not, my dears?

256
00:24:52.069 --> 00:24:55.402
There's no house
to equal it in the county.

257
00:24:55.614 --> 00:24:57.322
- Mr Darcy.
- Miss Bennet.

258
00:24:57.491 --> 00:25:00.326
- There she is.
- I don't know how to thank you.

259
00:25:00.494 --> 00:25:03.329
You're welcome any time
you feel the least bit poorly.

260
00:25:03.497 --> 00:25:06.664
Thank you for your stimulating company.
Most instructive.

261
00:25:06.834 --> 00:25:10.416
Not at all. The pleasure is all mine.

262
00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:15.047
- Mr Darcy.
- Miss Elizabeth.

263
00:25:27.479 --> 00:25:32.437
And then there was one
with great long lashes, like a cow.

264
00:25:32.609 --> 00:25:35.361
Ask Mrs Hill
to order us a sirloin, Betsy.

265
00:25:35.529 --> 00:25:38.945
Just the one, mind.
We're not made of money.

266
00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:45.324
I hope, my dear,
you've ordered a good dinner today.

267
00:25:45.539 --> 00:25:49.371
I've reason to expect
an addition to our family party.

268
00:25:49.585 --> 00:25:52.336
His name's Mr Collins,
the dreaded cousin.

269
00:25:52.504 --> 00:25:54.960
- Who is to inherit?
- Everything.

270
00:25:55.174 --> 00:25:58.009
Even my piano stool
belongs to Mr Collins.

271
00:25:58.177 --> 00:25:59.172
When?

272
00:25:59.386 --> 00:26:02.387
He may turn us out of the house
as soon as he pleases.

273
00:26:02.598 --> 00:26:05.848
The estate passes directly to him
and not to us poor females.

274
00:26:11.273 --> 00:26:13.479
Mr Collins, at your service.

275
00:26:22.868 --> 00:26:26.782
What a superbly featured room
and what excellent potatoes.

276
00:26:27.873 --> 00:26:31.953
It's many years since
I've had such an exemplary vegetable.

277
00:26:32.127 --> 00:26:36.421
To which fair cousin should I compliment
the excellence of the cooking?

278
00:26:36.632 --> 00:26:39.087
We are perfectly able to keep a cook.

279
00:26:39.259 --> 00:26:41.217
Excellent.

280
00:26:41.387 --> 00:26:44.802
I'm very pleased
the estate can afford such a living.

281
00:26:48.352 --> 00:26:51.768
I'm honoured to have as my patroness
Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

282
00:26:51.939 --> 00:26:54.560
You've heard of her, I presume?

283
00:26:54.733 --> 00:26:58.731
My small rectory abuts her estate,

284
00:26:58.904 --> 00:27:01.573
Rosings Park,
and she often condescends

285
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:07.576
to drive by my humble dwelling
in her little phaeton and ponies.

286
00:27:07.746 --> 00:27:09.371
Does she have any family?

287
00:27:09.581 --> 00:27:14.042
One daughter, the heiress of Rosings
and very extensive property.

288
00:27:14.253 --> 00:27:16.376
I've often observed to Lady Catherine

289
00:27:16.547 --> 00:27:19.631
that her daughter
seemed born to be a duchess,

290
00:27:19.842 --> 00:27:25.595
for she has all the superior graces
of elevated rank.

291
00:27:25.806 --> 00:27:29.555
These kind of compliments
are always acceptable to the ladies,

292
00:27:29.768 --> 00:27:34.062
and which I conceive myself
particularly bound to pay.

293
00:27:34.231 --> 00:27:36.769
How happy for you, Mr Collins,

294
00:27:36.942 --> 00:27:40.525
to possess the talent for flattering
with such delicacy.

295
00:27:42.614 --> 00:27:46.114
Do these attentions proceed
from the impulse of the moment

296
00:27:46.285 --> 00:27:48.740
or are they
the result of previous study?

297
00:27:48.954 --> 00:27:51.492
They arise
from what is passing at the time.

298
00:27:51.707 --> 00:27:56.084
And though I do sometimes amuse myself
with arranging such little compliments,

299
00:27:56.295 --> 00:27:59.878
I always wish to give them
as unstudied an air as possible.

300
00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:04.170
Oh, believe me, no one would suspect
your manners to be rehearsed.

301
00:28:10.893 --> 00:28:14.392
After dinner, I thought
I might read to you for an hour or two.

302
00:28:14.563 --> 00:28:17.564
<i>I have with me Fordyce's Sermons</i>

303
00:28:17.733 --> 00:28:22.194
which speak very eloquently
on all matters moral.

304
00:28:22.404 --> 00:28:26.782
<i>Are you familiar with Fordyce's Sermons,
Miss Bennet?</i>

305
00:28:31.747 --> 00:28:36.705
Mrs Bennet, I have been bestowed by the
good grace of Lady Catherine de Bourgh

306
00:28:36.877 --> 00:28:39.333
a parsonage of no mean size.

307
00:28:39.505 --> 00:28:41.628
I have become aware of the fact.

308
00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.755
It is my avowed hope
that soon I may find a mistress for it.

309
00:28:45.928 --> 00:28:49.344
And I have to inform you
that the eldest Miss Bennet

310
00:28:49.515 --> 00:28:53.347
has captured my special attention.

311
00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:56.265
Oh, Mr Collins.

312
00:28:56.438 --> 00:29:00.566
Unfortunately, it is incumbent upon me

313
00:29:00.734 --> 00:29:06.986
to hint that the eldest Miss Bennet
is very soon to be engaged.

314
00:29:07.157 --> 00:29:08.486
Engaged.

315
00:29:08.659 --> 00:29:11.114
But Miss Lizzie,
next to her in age and beauty,

316
00:29:11.328 --> 00:29:14.744
would make anyone an excellent partner.

317
00:29:14.915 --> 00:29:18.960
Do not you agree? Mr Collins?

318
00:29:19.128 --> 00:29:23.505
Indeed. Indeed.

319
00:29:23.716 --> 00:29:26.171
A very agreeable alternative.

320
00:29:48.198 --> 00:29:51.781
Mr Collins is a man who
makes you despair at the entire sex.

321
00:29:51.952 --> 00:29:56.246
- Yours, I believe.
- Oh, Mr Wickham, how perfect you are.

322
00:29:56.457 --> 00:29:59.623
He picked up my handkerchief.
Did you drop yours on purpose?

323
00:29:59.793 --> 00:30:01.252
Mr Wickham is a lieutenant.

324
00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:04.255
- An enchanted lieutenant.
- What are you up to, Liddy?

325
00:30:04.423 --> 00:30:07.507
- We happened to be looking for ribbon.
- White, for the ball.

326
00:30:07.718 --> 00:30:10.256
Shall we all look
for some ribbon together?

327
00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:16.806
- Good afternoon, Mr James.
- Miss Lydia, Miss Bennet.

328
00:30:17.019 --> 00:30:18.513
I shan't even browse.

329
00:30:18.687 --> 00:30:21.439
I can't be trusted.
I have poor taste in ribbons.

330
00:30:21.607 --> 00:30:24.145
Only a truly confident man
would admit that.

331
00:30:24.318 --> 00:30:25.777
No, it's true.

332
00:30:25.944 --> 00:30:29.111
And buckles.
When it comes to buckles, I'm lost.

333
00:30:29.281 --> 00:30:32.697
- You must be the shame of the regiment.
- The laughing stock.

334
00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:35.994
What do your superiors do with you?

335
00:30:37.456 --> 00:30:41.667
Ignore me. I'm of next to no importance,
so it's easily done.

336
00:30:42.836 --> 00:30:46.003
- Lizzie, lend me some money.
- You already owe me a fortune.

337
00:30:46.882 --> 00:30:50.465
- Allow me to oblige.
- No, Mr Wickham, please...

338
00:30:55.933 --> 00:30:58.222
I insist.

339
00:31:01.397 --> 00:31:04.481
- I pity the French.
- So do I.

340
00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:07.319
- Look, Mr Bingley.
- Mr Bingley!

341
00:31:07.486 --> 00:31:09.692
I was just on my way to your house.

342
00:31:09.905 --> 00:31:12.989
How do you like
my ribbons for your ball?

343
00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.616
- Very beautiful.
- She is. Look, she's blooming.

344
00:31:16.787 --> 00:31:18.412
Oh, Lydia.

345
00:31:18.622 --> 00:31:22.205
Be sure to invite Mr Wickham.
He is a credit to his profession.

346
00:31:22.376 --> 00:31:25.709
You can't invite people
to other people's balls.

347
00:31:26.296 --> 00:31:28.503
Of course, you must come, Mr Wickham.

348
00:31:28.674 --> 00:31:33.135
If you'll excuse me,
ladies, enjoy the day.

349
00:31:35.806 --> 00:31:39.056
Do you plan to go
to the Netherfield ball, Mr Wickham?

350
00:31:39.226 --> 00:31:44.766
Perhaps. How long
has Mr Darcy been a guest there?

351
00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:46.814
About a month.

352
00:31:46.984 --> 00:31:52.524
Forgive me, but are you
acquainted with him, with Mr Darcy?

353
00:31:52.698 --> 00:31:56.992
Indeed, I've been connected
with his family since infancy.

354
00:31:57.202 --> 00:32:02.078
You may well be surprised,
given our cold greeting this afternoon.

355
00:32:04.877 --> 00:32:08.376
I hope your plans in favour
of Meryton will not be affected

356
00:32:08.547 --> 00:32:12.592
- by your relations with the gentleman.
- It is not for me to be driven away.

357
00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:17.718
If he wishes to avoid seeing me,
he must go, not I.

358
00:32:17.931 --> 00:32:22.558
I must ask, what is the manner
of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?

359
00:32:25.773 --> 00:32:28.939
My father managed his estate.

360
00:32:29.151 --> 00:32:32.318
We grew up together, Darcy and I.

361
00:32:32.488 --> 00:32:38.491
His father treated me like a second son,
loved me like a son.

362
00:32:38.702 --> 00:32:41.158
We were both with him the day he died.

363
00:32:43.165 --> 00:32:45.039
With his last breath,

364
00:32:45.209 --> 00:32:48.375
his father bequeathed me
the rectory in his estate.

365
00:32:48.587 --> 00:32:52.170
He knew I had my heart set
on joining the Church.

366
00:32:52.341 --> 00:32:55.674
But Darcy ignored his wishes
and gave the living to another man.

367
00:32:55.886 --> 00:32:58.673
- But why?
- Jealousy.

368
00:33:00.683 --> 00:33:03.304
His father...

369
00:33:03.477 --> 00:33:06.561
Well, he loved me better
and Darcy couldn't stand it.

370
00:33:07.648 --> 00:33:10.317
- How cruel.
- So now I'm a poor foot-soldier.

371
00:33:10.484 --> 00:33:14.233
Too lowly even to be noticed.

372
00:33:25.874 --> 00:33:30.252
- Breathe in!
- I can't anymore. You're hurting.

373
00:33:33.507 --> 00:33:34.670
Betsy.

374
00:33:35.801 --> 00:33:37.426
Betsy!

375
00:33:48.856 --> 00:33:53.103
- There must've been a misunderstanding.
- Jane, you never think ill of anybody.

376
00:33:53.277 --> 00:33:56.860
How could Mr Darcy do such a thing?

377
00:33:57.031 --> 00:34:00.364
I will discover the truth
from Mr Bingley this evening.

378
00:34:00.576 --> 00:34:02.865
Let Mr Darcy contradict it himself.

379
00:34:03.037 --> 00:34:05.325
Till he does,
I hope never to encounter him.

380
00:34:05.497 --> 00:34:07.786
Poor, unfortunate, Mr Wickham.

381
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.123
Wickham is twice the man Darcy is.

382
00:34:10.294 --> 00:34:14.042
And, let us hope,
a rather more willing dancer.

383
00:34:19.303 --> 00:34:21.094
There they are, look.

384
00:34:21.263 --> 00:34:24.430
- Oh, yes.
- Billy.

385
00:34:30.105 --> 00:34:32.145
Jane Martin is here.

386
00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:03.593
May I say what an immense pleasure
it is to see you again.

387
00:35:03.806 --> 00:35:05.845
- Mrs Bennet.
- Miss Bingley.

388
00:35:06.058 --> 00:35:07.054
Charming.

389
00:35:09.853 --> 00:35:11.811
I'm so pleased you're here.

390
00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:14.187
So am I.

391
00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:19.358
And how are you? Miss Elizabeth?
Are you looking for someone?

392
00:35:19.571 --> 00:35:24.032
No, not at all, I was just admiring
the general splendour.

393
00:35:24.201 --> 00:35:27.950
- It is breathtaking, Mr Bingley.
- Good.

394
00:35:35.879 --> 00:35:40.588
You might have passed
a few pleasantries with Mr Bingley.

395
00:35:40.759 --> 00:35:44.508
I've never met a
more pleasant gentleman in all my years.

396
00:35:44.722 --> 00:35:47.177
Did you see how he dotes on her?

397
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:52.058
Dear Jane,
always doing what's best for her family.

398
00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:11.537
- Charlotte!
- Lizzie!

399
00:36:11.707 --> 00:36:16.499
- Have you seen Mr Wickham?
- No. Perhaps he's through here.

400
00:36:28.766 --> 00:36:33.059
Lizzie, Mr Wickham is not here.
Apparently, he's been detained.

401
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:36.520
Detained where? He must be here.

402
00:36:36.732 --> 00:36:40.943
- There you are.
- Mr Collins.

403
00:36:41.111 --> 00:36:44.611
Perhaps you will do me the honour,
Miss Elizabeth.

404
00:36:44.823 --> 00:36:48.903
Oh, I did not think you danced,
Mr Collins.

405
00:36:49.078 --> 00:36:53.621
I do not think it incompatible
with the office of a clergyman.

406
00:36:53.791 --> 00:36:57.207
Several people, her Ladyship
included, have complimented me

407
00:36:57.378 --> 00:37:01.043
on my lightness of foot.

408
00:37:25.698 --> 00:37:30.406
Apparently, your Mr Wickham has
been called on some business to town.

409
00:37:33.747 --> 00:37:37.792
Dancing is of little consequence
to me, but it does...

410
00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:41.543
...but it does afford
the opportunity to lavish...

411
00:37:45.509 --> 00:37:49.886
...upon one's partner attentions...
- My informer tells me...

412
00:37:50.097 --> 00:37:55.138
...that he would be less inclined
to be engaged, were it not for...

413
00:37:55.352 --> 00:37:57.559
...the presence
of a certain gentleman.

414
00:37:57.771 --> 00:37:59.811
Which is my primary object.

415
00:38:00.024 --> 00:38:02.811
That gentleman barely warrants the name.

416
00:38:02.985 --> 00:38:05.902
It is my intention, if I may be so bold,

417
00:38:06.071 --> 00:38:08.609
to remain close to you
throughout the evening.

418
00:38:23.088 --> 00:38:25.460
May I have the next dance,
Miss Elizabeth?

419
00:38:25.674 --> 00:38:27.548
You may.

420
00:38:37.686 --> 00:38:41.814
- Did I agree to dance with Mr Darcy?
- I dare say you will find him amiable.

421
00:38:41.982 --> 00:38:47.024
It would be most inconvenient since I've
sworn to loathe him for all eternity.

422
00:39:02.002 --> 00:39:05.834
- I love this dance.
- Indeed. Most invigorating.

423
00:39:09.968 --> 00:39:12.424
It is your turn to say something,
Mr Darcy.

424
00:39:13.931 --> 00:39:15.390
I talked about the dance.

425
00:39:15.557 --> 00:39:20.433
Now you ought to remark on the size
of the room or the number of couples.

426
00:39:20.604 --> 00:39:24.684
I'm perfectly happy to oblige.
What would you like most to hear?

427
00:39:24.858 --> 00:39:27.147
That reply will do for present.

428
00:39:30.406 --> 00:39:32.529
Perhaps by and by I may observe

429
00:39:32.741 --> 00:39:35.908
that private balls
are much pleasanter than public ones.

430
00:39:38.497 --> 00:39:41.664
For now, we may remain silent.

431
00:39:49.383 --> 00:39:52.467
Do you talk as a rule while dancing?

432
00:39:52.678 --> 00:39:56.510
No. No, I prefer to be
unsociable and taciturn.

433
00:40:00.519 --> 00:40:03.935
Makes it all so much more enjoyable,
don't you think?

434
00:40:06.316 --> 00:40:10.231
Tell me, do you and your sisters
very often walk to Meryton?

435
00:40:12.948 --> 00:40:16.364
Yes, we often walk to Meryton.

436
00:40:16.535 --> 00:40:19.489
It's a great opportunity
to meet new people.

437
00:40:21.373 --> 00:40:25.288
When you met us, we'd just had the
pleasure of forming a new acquaintance.

438
00:40:27.171 --> 00:40:31.382
Mr Wickham's blessed with such happy
manners, he's sure of making friends.

439
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:34.302
Whether he's capable
of retaining them is less so.

440
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:40.223
He's been so unfortunate as to lose
your friendship. That is irreversible?

441
00:40:40.434 --> 00:40:44.562
- It is. Why do you ask such a question?
- To make out your character.

442
00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:47.185
- What have you discovered?
- Very little.

443
00:40:47.441 --> 00:40:50.940
I hear such different accounts
of you as puzzle me exceedingly.

444
00:40:52.321 --> 00:40:54.859
I hope to afford you more clarity
in the future.

445
00:41:41.537 --> 00:41:44.407
- Is that Mr Darcy of Pemberley?
- I believe so.

446
00:41:44.581 --> 00:41:46.373
I must make myself known to him.

447
00:41:46.542 --> 00:41:49.459
He's a nephew of my patroness,
Lady Catherine.

448
00:41:49.628 --> 00:41:52.582
He will consider it an impertinence.

449
00:41:52.756 --> 00:41:55.294
Mr Darcy.

450
00:41:55.467 --> 00:41:57.590
Mr Darcy.

451
00:41:58.679 --> 00:42:03.471
Mr Darcy. Good evening...

452
00:42:03.684 --> 00:42:06.601
What interesting relatives you have.

453
00:42:23.996 --> 00:42:27.828
Mary, dear,
you've delighted us long enough.

454
00:42:28.042 --> 00:42:31.375
Let the other young ladies have a turn.

455
00:42:34.381 --> 00:42:37.086
... since I was a child,
and then she died.

456
00:42:37.259 --> 00:42:38.967
I have a beautiful grey.

457
00:42:39.178 --> 00:42:43.010
Of course, Caroline's
a much better rider than I, of course.

458
00:42:46.977 --> 00:42:51.354
Oh, yes. We fully expect
a most advantageous marriage.

459
00:42:52.524 --> 00:42:56.652
And my Jane, marrying so grand,
must throw her sisters in the way.

460
00:43:18.801 --> 00:43:23.842
Clearly my family are seeing who can
expose themselves to the most ridicule.

461
00:43:24.056 --> 00:43:27.970
- At least Bingley has not noticed.
- No.

462
00:43:28.143 --> 00:43:31.643
- I think he likes her very much.
- But does she like him?

463
00:43:31.814 --> 00:43:35.942
Few of us are secure enough to be
in love without proper encouragement.

464
00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:38.482
Bingley likes her enormously,

465
00:43:38.696 --> 00:43:41.400
but might not do more
if she does not help him on.

466
00:43:41.573 --> 00:43:45.322
She's just shy. If he cannot
perceive her regard, he is a fool.

467
00:43:45.494 --> 00:43:47.950
We are all fools in love.

468
00:43:48.122 --> 00:43:51.123
He does not know
her character as we do.

469
00:43:51.333 --> 00:43:53.705
She should move fast
and snap him up.

470
00:43:53.877 --> 00:43:57.293
There is plenty of time
for us to get to know him afterwards.

471
00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:02.422
I can't help feeling
that someone's going to produce a piglet

472
00:44:02.594 --> 00:44:04.552
and make us chase it.

473
00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:15.020
- Oh, dear!
- I do apologise, sir.

474
00:44:15.232 --> 00:44:19.146
I'm awfully sorry. Do forgive me.

475
00:44:38.714 --> 00:44:40.920
Emily, please!

476
00:44:42.343 --> 00:44:46.803
Mary, my dear Mary.
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

477
00:44:46.972 --> 00:44:50.139
- I've been practising all week.
- I know, my dear.

478
00:44:50.351 --> 00:44:52.723
I hate balls.

479
00:45:11.705 --> 00:45:13.994
Mr Bennet, wake up.

480
00:45:14.166 --> 00:45:18.875
Oh, I've never had such a good time!

481
00:45:21.256 --> 00:45:23.629
Charles, you cannot be serious.

482
00:45:30.724 --> 00:45:36.229
We'll have a wedding here in less than
three months if you ask me, Mr Bennet.

483
00:45:38.982 --> 00:45:40.560
Mr Bennet!

484
00:45:46.281 --> 00:45:48.986
Mary, please.

485
00:45:57.084 --> 00:45:59.373
Thank you, Mr Hill.

486
00:46:17.062 --> 00:46:20.147
Mrs Bennet, I was hoping,
if it would not trouble you,

487
00:46:20.357 --> 00:46:24.984
that I might solicit
a private audience with Miss Elizabeth.

488
00:46:25.195 --> 00:46:30.866
Oh, certainly,
Lizzie would be very happy indeed.

489
00:46:31.035 --> 00:46:35.412
Everyone, out. Mr Collins would like
a private audience with your sister.

490
00:46:35.622 --> 00:46:40.000
Wait, Mr Collins can have nothing
to say to me that anybody need not hear.

491
00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:44.125
I desire you will stay where you are.
Everyone else to the drawing room.

492
00:46:44.298 --> 00:46:45.840
- Mr Bennet.
- But...

493
00:46:46.008 --> 00:46:48.380
Now.

494
00:46:49.386 --> 00:46:54.179
- Jane. Jane, don't... Jane!
- Jane.

495
00:46:56.852 --> 00:46:59.936
Papa, stay.

496
00:47:26.382 --> 00:47:28.090
Dear Miss Elizabeth,

497
00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:31.883
My attentions have been
too marked to be mistaken.

498
00:47:32.096 --> 00:47:34.468
Almost as soon
as I entered the house,

499
00:47:34.682 --> 00:47:39.806
I singled you out
as the companion of my future life.

500
00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:42.690
But before I am run away
with my feelings,

501
00:47:42.856 --> 00:47:45.608
perhaps I may state
my reasons for marrying.

502
00:47:45.776 --> 00:47:48.232
Firstly, that it is
the duty of a clergyman

503
00:47:48.404 --> 00:47:51.073
to set the example
of matrimony in his parish.

504
00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:55.238
Secondly, I am convinced
it will add greatly to my happiness.

505
00:47:55.411 --> 00:47:58.328
And thirdly,
that it is at the urging

506
00:47:58.497 --> 00:48:02.080
of my esteemed patroness,
Lady Catherine,

507
00:48:02.251 --> 00:48:04.623
that I select a wife.

508
00:48:04.837 --> 00:48:07.921
My object in coming to Longbourn
was to choose such a one

509
00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:10.129
from among Mr Bennet's daughters,

510
00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:13.218
for I am to inherit the estate

511
00:48:13.387 --> 00:48:16.554
and such an alliance will surely...

512
00:48:17.766 --> 00:48:19.640
...suit everyone.

513
00:48:21.812 --> 00:48:26.355
And now nothing remains but for me to
assure you in the most animated language

514
00:48:26.525 --> 00:48:29.063
- of the violence of my affections.
- Mr Collins!

515
00:48:29.278 --> 00:48:31.401
And no reproach
on the subject of fortune

516
00:48:31.613 --> 00:48:36.240
- will cross my lips once we're married.
- You forget I have given no answer.

517
00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:39.993
Lady Catherine will
thoroughly approve when I speak to her

518
00:48:40.164 --> 00:48:45.289
of your modesty, economy
and other amiable qualities.

519
00:48:45.461 --> 00:48:50.170
Sir, I am honoured by your proposal,
but I regret that I must decline it.

520
00:48:51.342 --> 00:48:55.256
I know ladies
don't seek to seem too eager...

521
00:48:55.471 --> 00:48:59.136
Mr Collins, I am perfectly serious.
You could not make me happy.

522
00:48:59.308 --> 00:49:02.973
And I'm the last woman
in the world who could make you happy.

523
00:49:03.187 --> 00:49:07.730
I flatter myself that your refusal
is merely a natural delicacy.

524
00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:10.735
Besides, despite manifold attractions,

525
00:49:10.903 --> 00:49:15.197
it is by no means certain another offer
of marriage will ever be made to you.

526
00:49:15.407 --> 00:49:18.990
I must conclude that you simply seek
to increase my love by suspense,

527
00:49:19.203 --> 00:49:23.580
according to the usual practice
of elegant females.

528
00:49:23.749 --> 00:49:27.332
I am not the sort of female
to torment a respectable man.

529
00:49:27.503 --> 00:49:30.041
Please understand me,
I cannot accept you.

530
00:49:37.304 --> 00:49:40.471
Headstrong, foolish child.

531
00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:54.360
Don't worry, Mr Collins. We'll have this
little hiccup dealt with immediately.

532
00:49:55.489 --> 00:49:58.988
Lizzie. Lizzie!

533
00:50:03.122 --> 00:50:07.416
Mr Bennet, we're all in an uproar!

534
00:50:07.626 --> 00:50:11.291
You must come
and make Lizzie marry Mr Collins.

535
00:50:11.463 --> 00:50:13.919
Mr Collins has proposed to Lizzie,

536
00:50:14.133 --> 00:50:17.715
but she vowed she will not have him,
and now the danger is

537
00:50:17.886 --> 00:50:20.722
Mr Collins may not have Lizzie.

538
00:50:20.889 --> 00:50:25.516
- What am I to do?
- Well, come and talk to her.

539
00:50:25.686 --> 00:50:26.848
Now!

540
00:50:39.533 --> 00:50:42.617
- Tell her you insist they marry.
- Papa, please.

541
00:50:42.786 --> 00:50:46.866
You will have this house
and save your sisters from destitution.

542
00:50:47.041 --> 00:50:49.995
- I can't marry him.
- Go and say you've changed your mind.

543
00:50:50.169 --> 00:50:52.707
- Think of your family.
- You cannot make me.

544
00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:55.418
Mr Bennet, say something.

545
00:50:59.345 --> 00:51:02.678
Your mother insists
upon you marrying Mr Collins.

546
00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:05.595
Yes, or I shall never see her again.

547
00:51:05.768 --> 00:51:09.765
From this day onward, you must be
a stranger to one of your parents.

548
00:51:09.938 --> 00:51:12.394
Who will maintain you
when your father is dead?

549
00:51:12.608 --> 00:51:16.440
Your mother will never see you again
if you do not marry Mr Collins,

550
00:51:16.612 --> 00:51:19.779
and I will never see you again
if you do.

551
00:51:19.948 --> 00:51:21.573
Thank you, Papa.

552
00:51:25.329 --> 00:51:29.955
Ungrateful child!
I shall never speak to you again.

553
00:51:30.167 --> 00:51:32.836
Not that I take
much pleasure in talking.

554
00:51:33.837 --> 00:51:36.589
People who suffer as I do
from nervous complaints

555
00:51:36.757 --> 00:51:39.758
can have no pleasure
in talking to anybody.

556
00:51:39.968 --> 00:51:41.676
Jane!

557
00:51:44.973 --> 00:51:49.102
What's the matter? Jane?

558
00:52:43.615 --> 00:52:47.031
I don't understand
what would take him from Netherfield.

559
00:52:47.202 --> 00:52:49.491
Why does he not know when he'll return?

560
00:52:49.663 --> 00:52:50.826
Read it.

561
00:53:00.090 --> 00:53:04.717
"Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister
and we are scarcely less eager.

562
00:53:04.928 --> 00:53:07.846
I do not think Georgiana Darcy
has her equal for beauty,

563
00:53:08.015 --> 00:53:11.929
elegance and accomplishment.
I hope to call her hereafter my sister."

564
00:53:12.102 --> 00:53:14.807
Is that not clear enough?

565
00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:17.685
Caroline sees her brother
in love with you

566
00:53:17.858 --> 00:53:20.527
and has taken him off
to persuade him otherwise.

567
00:53:20.694 --> 00:53:25.652
But I know her to be incapable
of wilfully deceiving anyone.

568
00:53:25.866 --> 00:53:30.493
- It's more likely he does not love me.
- He loves you. Do not give up.

569
00:53:32.706 --> 00:53:34.746
Go to our aunt and uncle's in London,

570
00:53:34.958 --> 00:53:38.541
let it be known you are there
and I am sure he will come to you.

571
00:53:48.138 --> 00:53:52.765
Give my love to my sister
and try not to be a burden, dear.

572
00:53:52.935 --> 00:53:55.390
Poor Jane.

573
00:53:55.604 --> 00:53:59.981
Still, a girl likes to be
crossed in love now and then.

574
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:02.190
It gives her something to think of

575
00:54:02.361 --> 00:54:05.528
and a sort of distinction
amongst her companions.

576
00:54:05.739 --> 00:54:09.571
- I'm sure that will cheer her up, Papa.
- It's your turn now, Lizzie.

577
00:54:09.785 --> 00:54:11.659
You've turned down Collins.

578
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:16.123
You're free to go off
and be jilted yourself.

579
00:54:16.291 --> 00:54:18.165
What about Mr Wickham?

580
00:54:18.335 --> 00:54:21.122
He's a pleasant fellow
and he'd do the job credibly.

581
00:54:21.296 --> 00:54:24.962
- Father...
- And you have an affectionate mother

582
00:54:25.175 --> 00:54:28.758
who would make the most of it.

583
00:54:48.198 --> 00:54:50.321
- Charlotte!
- My dear Lizzie.

584
00:54:50.534 --> 00:54:56.039
I've come her to tell you the news.
Mr Collins and I are... engaged.

585
00:54:56.206 --> 00:54:58.495
- Engaged?
- Yes.

586
00:55:03.130 --> 00:55:08.006
- To be married?
- What other kind of engaged is there?

587
00:55:09.386 --> 00:55:12.802
For heaven's sake, Lizzie,
don't look at me like that.

588
00:55:12.973 --> 00:55:15.974
I should be
as happy with him as any other.

589
00:55:16.185 --> 00:55:18.972
- But he's ridiculous.
- Oh, hush.

590
00:55:19.146 --> 00:55:22.895
Not all of us can afford to be romantic.

591
00:55:23.067 --> 00:55:26.899
I've been offered
a comfortable home and protection.

592
00:55:27.071 --> 00:55:28.779
There's a lot to be thankful for.

593
00:55:28.989 --> 00:55:34.410
I'm 27 years old.
I've no money and no prospects.

594
00:55:34.578 --> 00:55:38.161
I'm already a burden to my parents.

595
00:55:38.332 --> 00:55:40.787
And I'm frightened.

596
00:55:40.959 --> 00:55:45.503
So dont judge me, Lizzie.
Don't you dare judge me.

597
00:56:38.017 --> 00:56:40.852
<i>Dear Charlotte,
thank you for your letter.</i>

598
00:56:42.187 --> 00:56:45.354
<i>I'm glad the house,
furniture and roads are to your taste,</i>

599
00:56:45.524 --> 00:56:48.940
<i>and that Lady Catherine's behaviour
is friendly and obliging.</i>

600
00:56:49.111 --> 00:56:51.780
<i>What with your departure,
Jane's to London</i>

601
00:56:51.947 --> 00:56:55.446
<i>and the militia to the North
with the colourful Mr Wickham,</i>

602
00:56:55.617 --> 00:56:59.532
<i>I must confess, the view
from where I sit has been rather grey.</i>

603
00:56:59.747 --> 00:57:02.701
<i>As for the favour you ask,
it is no favour at all.</i>

604
00:57:02.875 --> 00:57:07.003
<i>I would be happy to visit you
at your earliest convenience.</i>

605
00:57:13.719 --> 00:57:15.758
Welcome to our humble abode.

606
00:57:21.101 --> 00:57:24.850
My wife encourages me to spend time
in the garden for my health.

607
00:57:25.022 --> 00:57:27.394
I think our guest is tired
after her journey.

608
00:57:27.608 --> 00:57:32.234
I plan many improvements. I intend to
throw out a bough and plant a lime walk.

609
00:57:32.404 --> 00:57:35.358
I flatter myself
that any young lady would be happy

610
00:57:35.532 --> 00:57:38.533
to be the mistress of such a house.

611
00:57:39.703 --> 00:57:41.577
We shan't be disturbed here.

612
00:57:41.789 --> 00:57:45.621
This parlour is for
my own particular use.

613
00:57:48.379 --> 00:57:52.459
Oh, Lizzie, it's such a pleasure
to run my own home.

614
00:57:52.633 --> 00:57:55.634
- Charlotte, come here!
- What's happened?

615
00:57:55.803 --> 00:57:59.800
Has the pig escaped again?
Oh, it's Lady Catherine.

616
00:57:59.973 --> 00:58:02.511
Come and see, Lizzie.

617
00:58:02.685 --> 00:58:05.306
Great news.

618
00:58:05.479 --> 00:58:08.729
We received an invitation to Rosings
from Lady Catherine.

619
00:58:08.899 --> 00:58:10.441
How wonderful!

620
00:58:10.609 --> 00:58:13.610
Do not make yourself uneasy
about your apparel.

621
00:58:13.821 --> 00:58:16.109
Just put on the best you've brought.

622
00:58:16.281 --> 00:58:20.825
Lady Catherine's never been averse
to the truly humble.

623
00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:25.119
One of the most extraordinary
sights in all of Europe.

624
00:58:25.332 --> 00:58:28.832
The glazing alone
costs upwards of £20,000.

625
00:58:29.044 --> 00:58:31.582
Come along. Come along.

626
00:58:40.389 --> 00:58:43.306
A little later we'll play cards.

627
00:58:44.351 --> 00:58:47.138
Your Ladyship.

628
00:58:47.312 --> 00:58:50.313
Miss de Bourgh.

629
00:59:08.709 --> 00:59:12.208
- So, you are Elizabeth Bennet?
- I am, your Ladyship.

630
00:59:15.883 --> 00:59:18.338
This is my daughter.

631
00:59:20.471 --> 00:59:25.014
- It's kind of you to ask us to dine.
- The rug alone cost upwards of £300.

632
00:59:26.810 --> 00:59:28.933
Mr Darcy.

633
00:59:30.356 --> 00:59:32.395
What are you doing here?

634
00:59:34.526 --> 00:59:38.026
Mr Darcy,
I had no idea we had the honour.

635
00:59:39.782 --> 00:59:44.907
- Miss Elizabeth, I'm a guest here.
- You know my nephew?

636
00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:49.996
I had the pleasure
of meeting your nephew in Hertfordshire.

637
00:59:50.209 --> 00:59:52.914
Colonel Fitzwilliam. How do you do?

638
00:59:58.467 --> 01:00:04.470
Mr Collins, you can't sit
next to your wife. Move. Over there.

639
01:00:20.864 --> 01:00:24.530
Harvey, I wonder,
could you get me the fish course...

640
01:00:24.702 --> 01:00:28.782
I trust your family is in good health,
Miss Elizabeth?

641
01:00:28.956 --> 01:00:30.913
They are, thank you.

642
01:00:34.545 --> 01:00:37.629
My eldest sister is in London.
Perhaps you saw her there.

643
01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.797
I haven't been fortunate enough...

644
01:00:40.009 --> 01:00:44.386
Do you play the pianoforte,
Miss Bennet?

645
01:00:44.555 --> 01:00:49.015
- A little, ma'am, and very poorly.
- Do you draw?

646
01:00:50.310 --> 01:00:52.433
No, not at all.

647
01:00:52.646 --> 01:00:54.853
Your sisters, do they draw?

648
01:00:55.024 --> 01:00:56.352
Not one.

649
01:00:56.525 --> 01:00:58.019
That's very strange.

650
01:00:58.193 --> 01:01:00.815
I suppose you had no opportunity.

651
01:01:00.988 --> 01:01:04.902
Your mother should've taken you to town
for the benefit of the masters.

652
01:01:05.075 --> 01:01:09.203
My mother wouldn't have minded,
but my father hates town.

653
01:01:09.371 --> 01:01:12.787
- Has your governess left you?
- We never had a governess.

654
01:01:14.293 --> 01:01:18.456
No governess? Five daughters
brought up at home without a governess?

655
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:22.759
I never heard such a thing. Your mother
must've been a slave to your education.

656
01:01:22.926 --> 01:01:24.966
Not at all, Lady Catherine.

657
01:01:29.808 --> 01:01:32.264
Your younger sisters,
are they out in society?

658
01:01:32.478 --> 01:01:34.601
- Yes, ma'am, all.
- All?

659
01:01:34.772 --> 01:01:37.773
What, all five out at once?
That's very odd.

660
01:01:37.941 --> 01:01:41.690
And you second. The younger ones
out before the elders are married?

661
01:01:42.446 --> 01:01:45.363
Your youngest sisters
must be very young.

662
01:01:45.532 --> 01:01:47.240
Yes, my youngest is not 16.

663
01:01:48.118 --> 01:01:50.325
But it would be hard on younger sisters

664
01:01:50.496 --> 01:01:54.161
not to have their amusement
because the elder is still unmarried.

665
01:01:54.333 --> 01:01:57.334
It would hardly encourage
sisterly affection.

666
01:01:57.503 --> 01:02:02.461
Upon my word, you give your opinion
very decidedly for so young a person.

667
01:02:02.675 --> 01:02:05.344
Pray, what is your age?

668
01:02:05.511 --> 01:02:09.425
With three younger sisters grown up,
you can hardly expect me to own to it.

669
01:02:19.650 --> 01:02:21.689
Come, Miss Bennet, and play for us.

670
01:02:22.695 --> 01:02:26.194
- No, I beg you.
- For music is my delight.

671
01:02:26.365 --> 01:02:28.654
In fact,
there are few people in England

672
01:02:28.826 --> 01:02:32.740
who have more true enjoyment of music.

673
01:02:32.913 --> 01:02:34.491
Or better natural taste.

674
01:02:35.457 --> 01:02:41.044
If I had ever learnt,
I should've been a great proficient.

675
01:02:41.213 --> 01:02:45.377
So would Anne,
if her health would've allowed her.

676
01:02:45.551 --> 01:02:49.762
I'm not afflicted with false
modesty, when I say I play poorly...

677
01:02:49.930 --> 01:02:53.679
Come, Lizzie, her Ladyship demands it.

678
01:03:15.622 --> 01:03:18.789
How does Georgiana get along, Darcy?

679
01:03:19.001 --> 01:03:22.417
- She plays very well.
- I hope she practises.

680
01:03:22.588 --> 01:03:25.838
No excellence can be acquired
without constant practice.

681
01:03:26.008 --> 01:03:28.463
I've told Mrs Collins this.

682
01:03:28.677 --> 01:03:32.093
Though you have no instrument,
you're welcome to come to Rosings

683
01:03:32.264 --> 01:03:35.265
and play on the pianoforte
in the housekeeper's room.

684
01:03:35.476 --> 01:03:39.308
You'll be in nobody's way
in that part of the house.

685
01:03:46.528 --> 01:03:51.653
You mean to frighten me
by coming in all your state to hear me.

686
01:03:51.825 --> 01:03:55.740
But I won't be alarmed,
even if your sister does play so well.

687
01:03:55.913 --> 01:03:59.827
I know that I cannot alarm you
even should I wish it.

688
01:04:00.042 --> 01:04:03.956
What was my friend like
in Hertfordshire?

689
01:04:04.171 --> 01:04:07.172
You really care to know?

690
01:04:07.383 --> 01:04:10.549
Prepare yourself
for something very dreadful.

691
01:04:10.761 --> 01:04:13.762
The first time I saw him,
he danced with nobody,

692
01:04:13.931 --> 01:04:15.555
though gentlemen were scarce

693
01:04:15.766 --> 01:04:18.518
and there was more than
one lady without a partner.

694
01:04:18.686 --> 01:04:22.434
- I knew nobody beyond my own party.
- Nobody can be introduced at a ball.

695
01:04:22.648 --> 01:04:25.353
Fitzwilliam, I need you.

696
01:04:36.245 --> 01:04:38.700
I do not have the talent

697
01:04:38.914 --> 01:04:42.248
of conversing easily
with people I have never met before.

698
01:04:42.668 --> 01:04:46.333
Perhaps you should take
your aunt's advice and practise.

699
01:05:07.317 --> 01:05:10.188
<i>Dear Jane...</i>

700
01:05:22.207 --> 01:05:23.536
Mr Darcy.

701
01:05:31.425 --> 01:05:32.919
Please, do be seated.

702
01:05:38.891 --> 01:05:41.346
Mr and Mrs Collins
have gone to the village.

703
01:05:49.234 --> 01:05:51.192
This is a charming house.

704
01:05:51.362 --> 01:05:55.739
I believe my aunt did a great deal
to it when Mr Collins first arrived.

705
01:05:55.908 --> 01:05:58.280
I believe so.

706
01:05:59.578 --> 01:06:04.703
She could not have bestowed
her kindness on a more grateful subject.

707
01:06:13.133 --> 01:06:16.467
- Shall I call for some tea?
- No, thank you.

708
01:06:20.516 --> 01:06:23.303
Good day, Miss Elizabeth,
it's been a pleasure.

709
01:06:29.817 --> 01:06:33.316
What on earth have you done
to poor Mr Darcy?

710
01:06:33.487 --> 01:06:35.859
I have no idea.

711
01:06:37.074 --> 01:06:39.779
Every mind must have some counsellor

712
01:06:39.952 --> 01:06:43.617
to whom it may apply
for consolation in distress.

713
01:06:43.789 --> 01:06:48.581
There are many conveniences which
others can supply and we cannot procure.

714
01:06:48.752 --> 01:06:50.626
I have in view those objects

715
01:06:50.838 --> 01:06:53.922
which are only
to be obtained through intercourse...

716
01:06:56.301 --> 01:07:01.509
Forgive me, through the intercourse
of friendship or civility.

717
01:07:01.724 --> 01:07:07.477
On such occasions, the proud man steps
forth to meet you not with cordiality,

718
01:07:07.688 --> 01:07:12.480
but with the suspicion of one
who reconnoitres an enemy...

719
01:07:12.693 --> 01:07:16.276
- How long do you plan to stay?
- As long as Darcy chooses.

720
01:07:16.447 --> 01:07:19.697
- I am at his disposal.
- Everyone appears to be.

721
01:07:19.867 --> 01:07:23.615
I wonder he does not marry and secure
a lasting convenience of that kind.

722
01:07:23.829 --> 01:07:27.578
- She would be a lucky woman.
- Really?

723
01:07:27.791 --> 01:07:30.876
Darcy is a most loyal companion.

724
01:07:31.086 --> 01:07:34.502
He recently came to the
rescue of one of his friends.

725
01:07:34.673 --> 01:07:36.084
What happened?

726
01:07:36.258 --> 01:07:38.381
He saved him
from an imprudent marriage.

727
01:07:38.594 --> 01:07:39.756
Who's the man?

728
01:07:45.434 --> 01:07:49.099
His closest friend, Charles Bingley.

729
01:07:51.482 --> 01:07:54.436
Did Mr Darcy give a reason
for this interference?

730
01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:57.776
There were apparently
strong objections to the lady.

731
01:07:57.988 --> 01:08:01.238
What kind of objections?
Her lack of fortune?

732
01:08:01.450 --> 01:08:05.661
I think it was her family
that was considered unsuitable.

733
01:08:07.206 --> 01:08:11.915
- So he separated them?
- I believe so. I know nothing else.

734
01:08:42.199 --> 01:08:43.824
Miss Elizabeth.

735
01:08:43.993 --> 01:08:46.614
I have struggled in vain
and can bear it no longer.

736
01:08:46.787 --> 01:08:50.951
These past months have been a torment.
I came to Rosings only to see you.

737
01:08:51.125 --> 01:08:54.291
I have fought against
judgement, my family's expectation,

738
01:08:54.503 --> 01:08:57.338
the inferiority of your birth,
my rank.

739
01:08:57.506 --> 01:09:00.127
I will put them aside
and ask you to end my agony.

740
01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:03.467
- I don't understand.
- I love you.

741
01:09:05.597 --> 01:09:07.970
Most ardently.

742
01:09:10.978 --> 01:09:15.141
Please do me the honour
of accepting my hand.

743
01:09:16.567 --> 01:09:20.481
Sir, I appreciate the struggle
you have been through,

744
01:09:20.696 --> 01:09:23.234
and I am very sorry
to have caused you pain.

745
01:09:23.449 --> 01:09:25.488
It was unconsciously done.

746
01:09:26.910 --> 01:09:28.702
- Is this your reply?
- Yes, sir.

747
01:09:28.871 --> 01:09:31.576
- Are you laughing at me?
- No.

748
01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:32.911
Are you rejecting me?

749
01:09:33.125 --> 01:09:38.665
I'm sure the feelings which hindered
your regard will help you overcome it.

750
01:09:38.839 --> 01:09:42.006
Might I ask why with so little civility
I am thus repulsed?

751
01:09:42.217 --> 01:09:47.425
I might enquire why you told me you
liked me against your better judgement?

752
01:09:47.598 --> 01:09:49.887
If I was uncivil,
then that is some excuse.

753
01:09:50.059 --> 01:09:53.059
- But you know I have other reasons.
- What reasons?

754
01:09:53.228 --> 01:09:56.811
Do you think anything might tempt me
to accept the man who has ruined

755
01:09:56.982 --> 01:10:00.149
the happiness of a most beloved sister?

756
01:10:00.319 --> 01:10:05.028
Do you deny that you separated
a young couple who loved each other,

757
01:10:05.199 --> 01:10:07.571
exposing your friend
to censure for caprice

758
01:10:07.743 --> 01:10:10.578
and my sister to derision
for disappointed hopes,

759
01:10:10.746 --> 01:10:12.785
involving them both in acute misery?

760
01:10:12.998 --> 01:10:16.414
- I do not deny it.
- How could you do it?

761
01:10:16.585 --> 01:10:19.456
I believed your sister
indifferent to him.

762
01:10:19.630 --> 01:10:22.299
I realised his attachment
was deeper than hers.

763
01:10:22.466 --> 01:10:23.462
She's shy!

764
01:10:23.676 --> 01:10:26.297
Bingley was persuaded
she didn't feel strongly.

765
01:10:26.470 --> 01:10:28.510
- You suggested it.
- For his own good.

766
01:10:28.681 --> 01:10:31.516
My sister hardly shows
her true feelings to me.

767
01:10:35.729 --> 01:10:38.267
I suppose his fortune
had some bearing?

768
01:10:38.482 --> 01:10:41.020
I wouldn't do your sister the dishonour.

769
01:10:41.193 --> 01:10:43.233
- It was suggested...
- What was?

770
01:10:43.404 --> 01:10:45.859
It was clear an advantageous marriage...

771
01:10:46.031 --> 01:10:48.403
- Did my sister give that impression?
- No!

772
01:10:48.617 --> 01:10:52.697
- No. There was, however, your family...
- Our want of connection?

773
01:10:52.871 --> 01:10:55.327
- No, it was more than that.
- How, sir?

774
01:10:55.541 --> 01:11:00.416
The lack of propriety shown by your
mother, younger sisters and your father.

775
01:11:03.841 --> 01:11:08.799
Forgive me. You and your sister
I must exclude from this.

776
01:11:13.308 --> 01:11:15.100
And what about Mr Wickham?

777
01:11:17.354 --> 01:11:18.350
Mr Wickham?

778
01:11:18.564 --> 01:11:21.315
What excuse can you
give for your behaviour?

779
01:11:21.483 --> 01:11:24.733
- You take an eager interest.
- He told me of his misfortunes.

780
01:11:24.903 --> 01:11:27.573
- Oh, they have been great.
- You ruin his chances

781
01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:29.946
yet treat him with sarcasm.

782
01:11:30.117 --> 01:11:32.157
So this is your opinion of me?

783
01:11:32.369 --> 01:11:35.785
Thank you. Perhaps these offences
might have been overlooked

784
01:11:35.956 --> 01:11:40.250
had not your pride been hurt
by my scruples about our relationship.

785
01:11:40.461 --> 01:11:43.627
I am to rejoice in the inferiority
of your circumstances?

786
01:11:43.797 --> 01:11:46.467
And those are the words of a gentleman.

787
01:11:46.633 --> 01:11:51.342
Your arrogance and conceit, your selfish
disdain for the feelings of others

788
01:11:51.513 --> 01:11:57.267
made me realise you were the last man
in the world I could ever marry.

789
01:12:08.656 --> 01:12:13.531
Forgive me, madam,
for taking up so much of your time.

790
01:14:17.618 --> 01:14:19.741
I came to leave you this.

791
01:14:30.130 --> 01:14:33.962
I shall not renew the sentiments
which were so disgusting to you.

792
01:14:34.176 --> 01:14:38.423
But if I may, I will address the
two offences you have laid against me.

793
01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:48.354
<i>My father loved Mr Wickham as a son.</i>

794
01:14:48.565 --> 01:14:52.314
<i>He left him a generous living.
But upon my father's death,</i>

795
01:14:52.486 --> 01:14:57.113
<i>Mr Wickham announced
he had no intention of taking orders.</i>

796
01:14:57.324 --> 01:15:03.078
<i>He demanded the value of the living,
which he'd gambled away within weeks.</i>

797
01:15:05.416 --> 01:15:08.582
<i>He then wrote,
demanding more money, which I refused.</i>

798
01:15:08.752 --> 01:15:11.837
<i>After which,
he severed all acquaintance.</i>

799
01:15:12.047 --> 01:15:16.425
<i>He came back to see us last summer, and
declared passionate love for my sister,</i>

800
01:15:16.593 --> 01:15:20.508
<i>whom he tried to persuade
to elope with him.</i>

801
01:15:20.681 --> 01:15:24.346
<i>She is to inherit £30,000.</i>

802
01:15:24.518 --> 01:15:29.939
<i>When it was made clear he would never
receive a penny of it, he disappeared.</i>

803
01:15:30.107 --> 01:15:33.772
<i>I will not attempt to convey the depth
of Georgiana's despair.</i>

804
01:15:33.986 --> 01:15:37.070
<i>She was 15 years old.</i>

805
01:15:39.033 --> 01:15:42.698
<i>As to the other matter,
of your sister and Mr Bingley,</i>

806
01:15:42.911 --> 01:15:46.411
<i>though the motives which governed me
may appear insufficient,</i>

807
01:15:46.623 --> 01:15:49.957
<i>they were in the service of a friend.</i>

808
01:15:50.127 --> 01:15:52.167
Lizzie.

809
01:15:55.382 --> 01:15:57.256
Are you all right?

810
01:15:57.468 --> 01:16:00.801
I hardly know.

811
01:16:08.896 --> 01:16:11.897
Lizzie. How fortunate you have arrived.

812
01:16:12.107 --> 01:16:15.772
Your aunt and uncle are here
to deliver Jane from London.

813
01:16:15.944 --> 01:16:19.278
- How is Jane?
- She's in the drawing room.

814
01:16:21.909 --> 01:16:27.994
I'm quite over him. If he passed me
in the street, I'd hardly notice.

815
01:16:28.207 --> 01:16:32.039
London is so diverting. It's true.

816
01:16:33.837 --> 01:16:36.507
There's so much to entertain.

817
01:16:42.221 --> 01:16:44.178
What news from Kent?

818
01:16:46.183 --> 01:16:48.057
Nothing.

819
01:16:49.728 --> 01:16:51.935
At least not much to entertain.

820
01:16:52.106 --> 01:16:53.897
Lizzie, tell Mama!

821
01:16:54.108 --> 01:16:56.777
Stop making such a fuss.

822
01:16:56.944 --> 01:17:00.776
- Why didn't she ask me as well?
- Because I'm better company.

823
01:17:00.990 --> 01:17:03.527
- What's the matter?
- I've just as much right.

824
01:17:03.701 --> 01:17:05.907
Let's all go.

825
01:17:06.078 --> 01:17:09.032
Lydia's been invited to Brighton
with the Forsters.

826
01:17:09.206 --> 01:17:11.246
Sea-bathing would set me up nicely.

827
01:17:11.417 --> 01:17:13.705
I shall dine with the officers
every night.

828
01:17:13.877 --> 01:17:15.835
Papa, don't let her go.

829
01:17:16.046 --> 01:17:20.755
Lydia will never be easy until she's
exposed herself in some public place.

830
01:17:20.926 --> 01:17:25.469
And we could never expect her
to do it with so little inconvenience.

831
01:17:25.681 --> 01:17:27.720
If you do not check her,

832
01:17:27.933 --> 01:17:32.642
she'll be fixed as the silliest flirt
who ever made her family ridiculous.

833
01:17:32.855 --> 01:17:34.646
And Kitty will follow, as always.

834
01:17:34.857 --> 01:17:39.732
Lizzie, we shall have no peace
until she goes.

835
01:17:39.903 --> 01:17:43.237
Is that really all you care about?

836
01:17:43.407 --> 01:17:46.990
Colonel Forster is a sensible man.

837
01:17:47.202 --> 01:17:49.990
He will keep her
out of any real mischief.

838
01:17:50.164 --> 01:17:52.999
And she's too poor
to be an object of prey to anyone.

839
01:17:53.167 --> 01:17:54.329
It's dangerous.

840
01:17:54.543 --> 01:17:59.086
I am certain the officers will find
women better worth their while.

841
01:18:00.174 --> 01:18:04.006
Let us hope, in fact,
that her stay in Brighton

842
01:18:04.219 --> 01:18:09.012
will teach her her own insignificance.

843
01:18:09.224 --> 01:18:11.846
At any rate,
she can hardly grow any worse.

844
01:18:12.019 --> 01:18:16.562
If she does, we'd be obliged to
lock her up for the rest of her life.

845
01:18:25.824 --> 01:18:28.446
Lizzie, you're welcome to accompany us.

846
01:18:28.619 --> 01:18:30.576
The Peak District is not Brighton.

847
01:18:30.788 --> 01:18:34.287
Officers are thin on the ground
which may influence your decision.

848
01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:38.580
Come to the Peak District with us,
Lizzie, and get some fresh air.

849
01:18:38.754 --> 01:18:42.337
The glories of nature. What are men
compared to rocks and mountains?

850
01:18:42.549 --> 01:18:45.716
Men are either eaten up
with arrogance or stupidity.

851
01:18:45.886 --> 01:18:49.220
If they are amiable,
they have no minds of their own.

852
01:18:49.431 --> 01:18:52.681
Take care, my love.
That savours strongly of bitterness.

853
01:18:59.692 --> 01:19:03.938
I saw Mr Darcy when I was at Rosings.

854
01:19:04.113 --> 01:19:05.690
Why did you not tell me?

855
01:19:08.325 --> 01:19:10.781
Did he mention Mr Bingley?

856
01:19:12.913 --> 01:19:14.324
No.

857
01:19:18.752 --> 01:19:21.124
No, he did not.

858
01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:28.359
Oh, what are men
compared to rocks and mountains?

859
01:20:28.530 --> 01:20:32.030
Or carriages that work?

860
01:20:35.913 --> 01:20:38.451
Where exactly are we?

861
01:20:38.666 --> 01:20:41.038
Quite close to Pemberley.

862
01:20:42.795 --> 01:20:45.250
- Mr Darcy's home?
- That's the fellow.

863
01:20:45.422 --> 01:20:49.087
Very well-stocked lake.
I've a hankering to see it.

864
01:20:49.259 --> 01:20:50.339
Oh, no, let's not.

865
01:20:53.889 --> 01:20:56.095
Well, he's so...

866
01:20:56.308 --> 01:20:59.891
I'd rather not, he's so... he's so...

867
01:21:00.062 --> 01:21:01.770
- So what?
- So rich.

868
01:21:01.939 --> 01:21:05.105
By heavens, Lizzie,
what a snob you are!

869
01:21:05.275 --> 01:21:09.024
Objecting to Mr Darcy because of his
wealth. The poor man can't help it.

870
01:21:09.238 --> 01:21:14.659
He won't be there anyway.
These great men are never at home.

871
01:22:18.974 --> 01:22:20.349
Keep up.

872
01:22:40.788 --> 01:22:44.536
- Is your master much at home?
- Not as much as I would wish.

873
01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:47.206
He dearly loves it here.

874
01:22:47.378 --> 01:22:51.126
If he should marry,
you might see more of him.

875
01:22:59.682 --> 01:23:02.552
He's a lot like his father.

876
01:23:07.022 --> 01:23:11.483
When my husband was ill,
Mr Darcy couldn't do enough.

877
01:23:15.823 --> 01:23:19.903
He just organised the servants for me.

878
01:23:34.633 --> 01:23:38.382
This is he, Mr Darcy.

879
01:23:39.638 --> 01:23:41.761
A handsome face.

880
01:23:42.433 --> 01:23:46.181
Lizzie, is it a true likeness?

881
01:23:46.395 --> 01:23:49.811
Does the young lady
know Mr Darcy?

882
01:23:49.982 --> 01:23:52.271
Only a little.

883
01:23:52.484 --> 01:23:56.564
Do you not think him
a handsome man, miss?

884
01:23:56.739 --> 01:23:58.149
Yes.

885
01:24:00.743 --> 01:24:02.949
Yes, I dare say he is.

886
01:24:06.498 --> 01:24:09.416
This is his sister, Miss Georgiana.

887
01:24:09.877 --> 01:24:13.542
She sings and plays all day long.

888
01:24:15.799 --> 01:24:18.255
Is she at home?

889
01:26:24.053 --> 01:26:25.511
Miss Elizabeth.

890
01:26:36.774 --> 01:26:41.400
- I thought you were in London.
- No.

891
01:26:41.570 --> 01:26:43.859
No, I'm not.

892
01:26:44.031 --> 01:26:45.739
No.

893
01:26:45.908 --> 01:26:49.241
- We would not have come...
- I came back a day early...

894
01:26:55.042 --> 01:26:56.453
I'm with my aunt and uncle.

895
01:26:59.171 --> 01:27:01.211
And are you having a pleasant trip?

896
01:27:01.382 --> 01:27:04.003
Very pleasant.

897
01:27:04.176 --> 01:27:07.675
- Tomorrow we go to Matlock.
- Tomorrow?

898
01:27:09.556 --> 01:27:12.723
- Are you staying at Lambton?
- Yes, at the Rose and Crown.

899
01:27:12.935 --> 01:27:14.974
Yes.

900
01:27:18.732 --> 01:27:20.357
I'm so sorry to intrude.

901
01:27:20.567 --> 01:27:24.612
They said the house was open
for visitors. I had no idea.

902
01:27:28.617 --> 01:27:30.989
- May I see you back to the village?
- No.

903
01:27:34.581 --> 01:27:37.037
- I'm very fond of walking.
- Yes.

904
01:27:39.169 --> 01:27:40.794
Yes, I know.

905
01:27:45.634 --> 01:27:48.006
Goodbye, Mr Darcy.

906
01:28:05.738 --> 01:28:08.193
This way, sir.

907
01:28:14.204 --> 01:28:16.327
Are you sure you
wouldn't like to join us?

908
01:28:29.428 --> 01:28:32.927
We've just met Mr Darcy.
You didn't tell us that you'd seen him.

909
01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:37.766
He's asked us to dine with him tomorrow.
He was very civil, was he not?

910
01:28:37.936 --> 01:28:40.474
- Very civil.
- Not at all how you'd painted him.

911
01:28:40.689 --> 01:28:42.018
To dine with him?

912
01:28:42.191 --> 01:28:46.568
There's something pleasant
about his mouth when he speaks.

913
01:28:46.737 --> 01:28:49.654
You don't mind delaying
our journey another day?

914
01:28:49.823 --> 01:28:53.406
He particularly wants you
to meet his sister.

915
01:28:53.577 --> 01:28:55.285
His sister.

916
01:29:23.857 --> 01:29:25.897
Miss Elizabeth!

917
01:29:30.531 --> 01:29:32.488
My sister, Miss Georgiana.

918
01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:34.823
My brother has told me
so much about you,

919
01:29:35.035 --> 01:29:38.036
- I feel as if we are friends already.
- Thank you.

920
01:29:38.205 --> 01:29:41.539
- What a beautiful pianoforte.
- My brother gave it to me.

921
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:43.707
- He shouldn't have.
- I should have.

922
01:29:43.877 --> 01:29:47.128
- Very well then.
- Easily persuaded, is she not?

923
01:29:48.257 --> 01:29:51.174
He once had to put up with my playing.

924
01:29:51.343 --> 01:29:56.052
- He says you play so well.
- Then he has perjured himself.

925
01:29:56.223 --> 01:29:59.390
- I said "quite well".
- "Quite well" is not "very well".

926
01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:01.268
I'm satisfied.

927
01:30:07.526 --> 01:30:10.444
- Mr Gardiner, are you fond of fishing?
- Very much.

928
01:30:10.612 --> 01:30:13.400
Would you accompany me
to the lake this afternoon?

929
01:30:13.574 --> 01:30:16.112
Its occupants have been left
in peace too long.

930
01:30:16.285 --> 01:30:20.496
- I would be delighted.
- Do you play duets, Miss Elizabeth?

931
01:30:20.664 --> 01:30:25.871
- Only when forced.
- Brother, you must force her.

932
01:30:26.086 --> 01:30:29.835
Splendid fishing, good
company. What a capital fellow.

933
01:30:30.007 --> 01:30:33.008
Thank you so much, Mr Darcy.

934
01:30:35.012 --> 01:30:37.135
A letter for you, madam.

935
01:30:37.306 --> 01:30:39.180
Oh, it's from Jane.

936
01:31:03.707 --> 01:31:05.830
It is the most dreadful news.

937
01:31:08.295 --> 01:31:10.502
Lydia has run away...

938
01:31:13.384 --> 01:31:15.175
...with Mr Wickham.

939
01:31:15.344 --> 01:31:17.218
They are gone to Lord knows where.

940
01:31:17.388 --> 01:31:23.390
She has no money, no connections.
I fear she is lost forever.

941
01:31:26.939 --> 01:31:28.813
This is my fault.

942
01:31:29.024 --> 01:31:32.524
If only I had exposed Wickham
when I should.

943
01:31:32.695 --> 01:31:35.695
No, this is my fault.

944
01:31:35.906 --> 01:31:39.156
I might have prevented all this
by being open with my sisters.

945
01:31:40.119 --> 01:31:43.120
Has anything been done to recover her?

946
01:31:43.330 --> 01:31:48.372
My father has gone to London,
but I know nothing can be done.

947
01:31:50.379 --> 01:31:53.214
We have not the smallest hope.

948
01:31:53.382 --> 01:31:55.256
Would I could help you.

949
01:31:55.426 --> 01:31:57.632
Sir, I think it is too late.

950
01:32:01.390 --> 01:32:05.388
This is grave indeed.
I will leave you. Goodbye.

951
01:32:05.561 --> 01:32:07.518
We must go at once.

952
01:32:07.688 --> 01:32:11.436
I will join Mr Bennet and find Lydia
before she ruins the family.

953
01:32:39.094 --> 01:32:43.970
Why did the Forsters
let her out of their sight?

954
01:32:44.141 --> 01:32:47.308
I always said they were unfit
to take charge of her.

955
01:32:47.519 --> 01:32:50.769
- And now she is ruined.
- You are all ruined.

956
01:32:50.981 --> 01:32:56.355
Who will take you now
with a fallen sister?

957
01:32:56.528 --> 01:33:00.028
Poor Mr Bennet will now have
to fight the perfidious Wickham

958
01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:01.783
and then be killed.

959
01:33:01.950 --> 01:33:03.824
He hasn't found him yet, Mama.

960
01:33:04.036 --> 01:33:06.823
Mr Collins will turn us out
before he is cold.

961
01:33:06.997 --> 01:33:10.912
Do not be so alarmed. Our uncle
is in London helping in the search.

962
01:33:11.126 --> 01:33:16.334
Lydia must know
what this must be doing to my nerves.

963
01:33:16.548 --> 01:33:21.756
Such flutterings
and spasms all over me!

964
01:33:23.639 --> 01:33:27.471
My baby Lydia, my baby!

965
01:33:27.685 --> 01:33:32.181
How could she do such a thing
to her poor mama?

966
01:33:33.315 --> 01:33:35.771
- You can't do that!
- Don't be such a baby.

967
01:33:35.984 --> 01:33:38.654
- Kitty, give it to me.
- Who's it for?

968
01:33:38.821 --> 01:33:40.445
It's addressed to Papa.

969
01:33:41.949 --> 01:33:43.941
It's in Uncle's writing.

970
01:33:44.368 --> 01:33:46.906
Papa, there's a letter.

971
01:33:47.079 --> 01:33:50.495
- Let me catch my breath.
- It's in Uncle's writing.

972
01:33:55.045 --> 01:33:57.252
- He's found them.
- Are they married?

973
01:33:57.423 --> 01:33:59.878
- I can't make out his script.
- Give it to me.

974
01:34:00.092 --> 01:34:01.337
Are they married?

975
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:06.053
They will be if Father settles £100
a year on her. That is his condition.

976
01:34:06.223 --> 01:34:09.058
- You will agree to this, Father?
- Of course.

977
01:34:09.226 --> 01:34:13.603
God knows how much your uncle
must've laid on that wretched man.

978
01:34:13.814 --> 01:34:14.977
What do you mean?

979
01:34:15.149 --> 01:34:17.022
No man would marry Lydia

980
01:34:17.234 --> 01:34:21.398
under so slight
a temptation as £100 a year.

981
01:34:21.572 --> 01:34:24.241
Your uncle must've been very generous.

982
01:34:25.159 --> 01:34:27.531
Do you think it a large sum?

983
01:34:27.703 --> 01:34:30.870
Wickham's a fool if he
accepts less than £10,000.

984
01:34:31.081 --> 01:34:33.868
- Heaven forbid!
- Father!

985
01:34:35.502 --> 01:34:39.963
Lydia married and at 15 too!

986
01:34:40.174 --> 01:34:42.047
Ring the bell, Kitty.

987
01:34:42.259 --> 01:34:46.720
I must put on my things and tell
Lady Lucas. Oh, to see her face.

988
01:34:46.930 --> 01:34:49.635
Tell the servants
they will have a bowl of punch.

989
01:34:49.808 --> 01:34:52.595
- We should thank our uncle.
- So he should help.

990
01:34:52.770 --> 01:34:56.269
He's far richer than us
and has no children. Daughter married!

991
01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:58.397
Is that really all you think about?

992
01:34:58.567 --> 01:35:02.481
When you have five daughters, tell me
what else will occupy your thoughts.

993
01:35:02.696 --> 01:35:04.488
Then perhaps you'll understand.

994
01:35:05.824 --> 01:35:08.659
You don't know what he's like.

995
01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:12.241
- Lydia!
- Oh, Mama!

996
01:35:16.418 --> 01:35:18.375
We passed Sarah Sims in her carriage.

997
01:35:18.587 --> 01:35:22.419
So I took off my glove
so she might see the ring.

998
01:35:22.633 --> 01:35:25.550
Then I bowed and smiled
like anything...

999
01:35:25.719 --> 01:35:30.346
I'm sure she was not
half as radiant as you, my dear.

1000
01:35:30.516 --> 01:35:32.639
You must all go to Brighton.

1001
01:35:32.851 --> 01:35:36.434
That is the place to get husbands.
I hope you have half my good luck.

1002
01:35:36.647 --> 01:35:38.106
Lydia.

1003
01:35:38.273 --> 01:35:42.485
I want to hear
every little detail, Lydia, dear.

1004
01:35:42.653 --> 01:35:45.654
I've been enlisted
in a regiment in the North of England.

1005
01:35:45.823 --> 01:35:47.447
Glad to hear it.

1006
01:35:47.616 --> 01:35:50.866
Near Newcastle.
We travel there next week.

1007
01:35:51.036 --> 01:35:55.081
- Can I come and stay with you?
- That is out of the question.

1008
01:35:55.249 --> 01:35:58.084
Monday morning came
and I was in such a fuss.

1009
01:35:58.252 --> 01:35:59.414
I don't want to hear.

1010
01:35:59.586 --> 01:36:03.169
There was my aunt preaching away
as if reading a sermon.

1011
01:36:03.382 --> 01:36:07.047
- She was horrid unpleasant.
- Can't you understand why?

1012
01:36:07.261 --> 01:36:11.508
But I didn't hear a word because
I was thinking of my dear Wickham.

1013
01:36:11.682 --> 01:36:14.351
I longed to know if
he'd be married in his bluecoat.

1014
01:36:14.518 --> 01:36:19.061
The North of England, I believe,
boasts some spectacular scenery.

1015
01:36:19.231 --> 01:36:23.063
So I thought, who is to be
our best man if he doesn't come back?

1016
01:36:23.277 --> 01:36:26.860
Lucky, he did,
or I would've had to ask Mr Darcy.

1017
01:36:27.031 --> 01:36:31.408
- Mr Darcy!
- I forgot!

1018
01:36:31.577 --> 01:36:34.993
- But I shouldn't have said a word.
- Mr Darcy was at your wedding?

1019
01:36:35.164 --> 01:36:38.081
He was the one that discovered us.

1020
01:36:38.250 --> 01:36:43.042
He paid for the wedding,
Wickham's commission, everything.

1021
01:36:43.255 --> 01:36:45.129
But he told me not to tell.

1022
01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:48.755
- Mr Darcy?
- Stop it, Lizzie.

1023
01:36:49.887 --> 01:36:53.931
Mr Darcy's not half as high and mighty
as you sometimes.

1024
01:36:59.563 --> 01:37:02.647
Kitty, have you seen my ring?

1025
01:37:02.858 --> 01:37:04.981
Write to me often, my dear.

1026
01:37:05.194 --> 01:37:08.278
Married women
never have much time for writing.

1027
01:37:08.447 --> 01:37:10.321
I dare say you won't.

1028
01:37:10.532 --> 01:37:15.490
When I married your father, there didn't
seem to be enough hours in the day.

1029
01:37:17.164 --> 01:37:22.040
My sisters may write to me,
for they'll have nothing else to do.

1030
01:37:29.176 --> 01:37:33.221
There's nothing so bad
as parting with one's children.

1031
01:37:34.223 --> 01:37:38.055
One seems so forlorn without them.

1032
01:37:42.481 --> 01:37:47.606
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Lydia. Goodbye, Mr Wickham.

1033
01:37:49.238 --> 01:37:51.859
Bye, Kitty. Bye, Papa.

1034
01:37:57.788 --> 01:38:00.955
I can't imagine what your
father does with all that ink.

1035
01:38:01.166 --> 01:38:03.040
Mrs Bennet.

1036
01:38:04.128 --> 01:38:08.837
Did you hear the news, madam?
Mr Bingley is returning to Netherfield.

1037
01:38:09.008 --> 01:38:13.136
Mrs Nichols is ordering a haunch
of pork. She expects him tomorrow.

1038
01:38:13.303 --> 01:38:15.676
Tomorrow?

1039
01:38:15.889 --> 01:38:18.427
Not that I care.
Mr Bingley's nothing to us.

1040
01:38:18.642 --> 01:38:21.892
I'm sure I never want
to see him again, no.

1041
01:38:22.062 --> 01:38:26.440
We shan't mention a word about it.
Is it quite certain he's coming?

1042
01:38:26.650 --> 01:38:31.526
Yes, madam. I believe he's alone.
His sister remains in town.

1043
01:38:33.532 --> 01:38:38.490
Why he thinks we should be interested,
I've no idea. Come along, girls.

1044
01:38:39.455 --> 01:38:43.749
We better go home at once
and tell Mr Bennet.

1045
01:38:43.917 --> 01:38:47.832
The impudence of the man.
I wonder he dare show his face.

1046
01:38:48.005 --> 01:38:50.044
It's all right, Lizzie.

1047
01:38:50.215 --> 01:38:53.216
I'm just glad he's alone
because we shall see less of him.

1048
01:38:53.385 --> 01:38:57.679
Not that I'm afraid of myself.
But I dread other people's remarks.

1049
01:38:57.890 --> 01:38:59.514
Oh, I'm sorry.

1050
01:39:33.842 --> 01:39:36.131
He's here. He's here. He's at the door.

1051
01:39:37.262 --> 01:39:40.347
- Mr Bingley!
- Mr Bingley?

1052
01:39:40.516 --> 01:39:43.517
Oh, my goodness!
Everybody behave naturally.

1053
01:39:43.727 --> 01:39:46.349
And whatever you do,
do not appear overbearing.

1054
01:39:46.522 --> 01:39:50.104
There's someone with him.
Mr Whatsisname, the pompous one.

1055
01:39:50.317 --> 01:39:54.944
Mr Darcy? The insolence of
it. What does he think of, coming here?

1056
01:39:55.155 --> 01:40:00.031
Keep still, Jane. Mary, put that away at
once. Find some useful employment.

1057
01:40:01.412 --> 01:40:05.077
Oh, my Lord, I shall have a seizure,
I'm sure I shall.

1058
01:40:05.249 --> 01:40:07.206
Kitty.

1059
01:40:07.376 --> 01:40:11.623
- We can't have this here.
- Mary, the ribbons, the ribbons.

1060
01:40:13.215 --> 01:40:17.842
Mary, sit down at once. Mary!

1061
01:40:21.557 --> 01:40:26.017
Mr Darcy and Mr Bingley, ma'am.

1062
01:40:36.864 --> 01:40:39.569
How glad we are
to see you, Mr Bingley.

1063
01:40:39.742 --> 01:40:42.411
There have been
many changes since you went away.

1064
01:40:42.578 --> 01:40:47.536
Miss Lucas is married and settled.
And one of my own daughters too.

1065
01:40:47.708 --> 01:40:49.582
You will have seen it in the papers,

1066
01:40:49.793 --> 01:40:52.331
though it was not put in
as it ought to have been.

1067
01:40:52.546 --> 01:40:56.211
Very short. Nothing about her family.

1068
01:40:56.383 --> 01:40:59.218
Yes, I did hear of it.
I offer my congratulations.

1069
01:40:59.386 --> 01:41:02.802
But it is very hard
to have my Lydia taken away from me.

1070
01:41:03.015 --> 01:41:07.060
Mr Wickham has been transferred
to Newcastle, wherever that is.

1071
01:41:07.227 --> 01:41:09.101
Will you stay long in the country?

1072
01:41:09.313 --> 01:41:11.519
Just a few weeks. For the shooting.

1073
01:41:11.732 --> 01:41:13.771
When you've killed all your own birds,

1074
01:41:13.942 --> 01:41:17.027
I beg you will come here
and shoot as many as you please.

1075
01:41:17.196 --> 01:41:21.739
Mr Bennet will be vastly happy to oblige
and will save the best coveys for you.

1076
01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:24.406
Excellent.

1077
01:41:24.578 --> 01:41:28.492
- Are you well, Mr Darcy?
- Quite well, thank you.

1078
01:41:28.666 --> 01:41:31.038
I hope the weather stays fine
for your sport.

1079
01:41:31.210 --> 01:41:34.709
- I return to town tomorrow.
- So soon?

1080
01:41:36.382 --> 01:41:40.925
My Jane looks well, does she not?

1081
01:41:42.763 --> 01:41:44.886
She does indeed.

1082
01:41:52.272 --> 01:41:55.024
Well, we must be going, I think.

1083
01:41:55.734 --> 01:41:59.399
Darcy. It's been very pleasant
to see you all again.

1084
01:41:59.613 --> 01:42:01.570
Miss Elizabeth. Miss Bennet.

1085
01:42:01.782 --> 01:42:03.157
You must come again.

1086
01:42:03.325 --> 01:42:06.825
Last winter, you promised to have
a family dinner with us.

1087
01:42:07.037 --> 01:42:11.830
I've not forgot, you see.
At least three courses.

1088
01:42:17.631 --> 01:42:19.339
Excuse me.

1089
01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:28.015
Most extraordinary.

1090
01:42:39.111 --> 01:42:42.527
We were going to walk in
and she was going to say, "Sit down."

1091
01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:44.779
So, I feel...

1092
01:42:55.252 --> 01:42:57.043
Oh, it's a disaster, isn't it?

1093
01:42:57.254 --> 01:42:59.211
It's been...

1094
01:43:01.675 --> 01:43:03.798
- Miss Bennet.
- Mr Bingley.

1095
01:43:04.011 --> 01:43:06.798
I'll just go in and I'll just say it.

1096
01:43:06.972 --> 01:43:09.261
Yes, exactly.

1097
01:43:13.937 --> 01:43:17.686
I'm glad that's over. Now we can
meet as indifferent acquaintances.

1098
01:43:17.858 --> 01:43:18.854
Oh, yes.

1099
01:43:19.068 --> 01:43:22.152
You cannot think me so weak
as to be in danger now.

1100
01:43:22.363 --> 01:43:26.195
You are in great danger of making
him as much in love with you as ever.

1101
01:43:27.993 --> 01:43:32.536
- I'm sorry he came with Mr Darcy.
- Don't say that.

1102
01:43:33.874 --> 01:43:34.953
Why ever not?

1103
01:43:37.795 --> 01:43:40.879
Jane.

1104
01:43:41.048 --> 01:43:45.924
- I've been so blind.
- What do you mean?

1105
01:43:46.136 --> 01:43:48.888
Look, it's him.
He's back. He's come again.

1106
01:43:57.272 --> 01:43:59.230
I know this is all very untoward,

1107
01:43:59.441 --> 01:44:03.653
but I would like to request the
privilege of speaking to Miss Bennet.

1108
01:44:04.780 --> 01:44:06.986
Alone.

1109
01:44:08.575 --> 01:44:11.826
Everybody to the kitchen immediately.

1110
01:44:11.996 --> 01:44:16.040
Except you, Jane, dear, of course.

1111
01:44:18.002 --> 01:44:23.043
Oh, Mr Bingley, it's so good
to see you again so soon.

1112
01:44:43.110 --> 01:44:47.902
First, I must tell you I've been the
most unmitigated and comprehensive ass.

1113
01:45:06.425 --> 01:45:07.884
Kitty, be quiet.

1114
01:45:20.272 --> 01:45:22.728
Yes.

1115
01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:25.188
A thousand times yes.

1116
01:45:30.532 --> 01:45:34.032
Thank the Lord for that.
I thought it would never happen.

1117
01:46:20.374 --> 01:46:24.751
I am confident
they will do well together.

1118
01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:28.918
Their tempers are much alike.

1119
01:46:30.009 --> 01:46:33.923
They will be cheated assiduously
by their servants.

1120
01:46:34.138 --> 01:46:40.306
And be so generous with the rest,
they will always exceed their income.

1121
01:46:40.519 --> 01:46:45.062
Exceed their income?
He has 5,000 a year.

1122
01:46:49.028 --> 01:46:52.527
I knew she did not be
so beautiful for nothing.

1123
01:47:00.914 --> 01:47:03.370
"...must be free from all insincerity.

1124
01:47:03.542 --> 01:47:07.207
She only can address herself effectually
to the feelings of others

1125
01:47:07.421 --> 01:47:10.671
whose mind glows
with the warmth of sensibility

1126
01:47:10.883 --> 01:47:13.634
and whose arguments result
from conviction.

1127
01:47:13.802 --> 01:47:17.302
She must feel the influence
of those passions and emotions

1128
01:47:17.514 --> 01:47:20.681
which she wishes to inspire..."

1129
01:47:41.455 --> 01:47:43.744
Can you die of happiness?

1130
01:47:45.334 --> 01:47:48.335
He was ignorant
of my being in town in the spring.

1131
01:47:48.504 --> 01:47:51.588
- How did he account for it?
- He thought me indifferent.

1132
01:47:51.757 --> 01:47:55.505
- Unfathomable.
- No doubt poisoned by his sister.

1133
01:47:55.678 --> 01:48:01.264
Bravo. That's the most
unforgiving speech you've ever made.

1134
01:48:01.433 --> 01:48:03.640
Oh, Lizzie, if I could
but see you so happy.

1135
01:48:03.852 --> 01:48:06.141
If there was such a man for you.

1136
01:48:09.900 --> 01:48:13.150
Perhaps Mr Collins has a cousin.

1137
01:48:15.906 --> 01:48:17.780
- What is that?
- What?

1138
01:48:17.950 --> 01:48:21.034
Maybe he's changed his mind.

1139
01:48:23.247 --> 01:48:25.370
Coming!

1140
01:48:28.460 --> 01:48:29.871
Yes.

1141
01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:33.920
Lady Catherine.

1142
01:48:39.596 --> 01:48:42.514
The rest of your offspring, I presume?

1143
01:48:42.683 --> 01:48:46.431
All but one. The youngest
has been lately married, your Ladyship.

1144
01:48:46.603 --> 01:48:49.557
My eldest was proposed to
only this afternoon.

1145
01:48:51.442 --> 01:48:55.439
- You have a very small garden.
- Could I offer you a cup of tea?

1146
01:48:55.612 --> 01:48:59.028
Absolutely not. I need to speak
to Miss Elizabeth Bennet alone.

1147
01:48:59.867 --> 01:49:02.073
As a matter of urgency.

1148
01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:09.373
You can be at no loss
to understand why I am here.

1149
01:49:09.543 --> 01:49:11.832
I cannot account for this honour at all.

1150
01:49:12.046 --> 01:49:16.257
I warn you, I am not to be trifled with.

1151
01:49:16.425 --> 01:49:18.797
A most alarming report
has reached me.

1152
01:49:18.969 --> 01:49:23.512
That you intend to be united
with my nephew, Mr Darcy.

1153
01:49:23.682 --> 01:49:27.265
I know this to be a falsehood.
Though not wishing to injure him

1154
01:49:27.478 --> 01:49:31.392
by supposing it possible, I instantly
set off to make my sentiments known.

1155
01:49:31.565 --> 01:49:34.649
If you believed it impossible,
I wonder that you came so far.

1156
01:49:34.860 --> 01:49:36.188
To hear it contradicted.

1157
01:49:36.362 --> 01:49:39.777
Your coming will be a confirmation
if such a report exists.

1158
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:43.240
lf? You pretend to be ignorant of it?

1159
01:49:43.410 --> 01:49:46.411
Has it not been
industriously circulated by yourself?

1160
01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:48.454
I have never heard of it.

1161
01:49:48.666 --> 01:49:51.038
Can you declare
there is no foundation for it?

1162
01:49:51.251 --> 01:49:54.751
I do not pretend to possess
equal frankness with your Ladyship.

1163
01:49:54.922 --> 01:49:58.006
You may ask a question
which I may choose not to answer.

1164
01:49:58.217 --> 01:50:00.505
Has my nephew
made you an offer of marriage?

1165
01:50:00.678 --> 01:50:03.762
Your Ladyship has declared it
to be impossible.

1166
01:50:03.931 --> 01:50:07.514
Mr Darcy is engaged to my daughter.
Now what have you to say?

1167
01:50:07.685 --> 01:50:11.433
If that is the case, you cannot suppose
he would make an offer to me.

1168
01:50:11.605 --> 01:50:16.730
Selfish girl. This union
has been planned since their infancy.

1169
01:50:16.944 --> 01:50:20.277
Do you think it can be prevented
by a woman of inferior birth

1170
01:50:20.489 --> 01:50:24.950
whose own sister's elopement resulted
in a scandalously patched-up marriage

1171
01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:28.410
only achieved
at the expense of your uncle.

1172
01:50:28.580 --> 01:50:32.495
Heaven and Earth! Are the shades
of Pemberley to be thus polluted?

1173
01:50:32.668 --> 01:50:35.206
Tell me once and for all,
are you engaged to him?

1174
01:50:38.674 --> 01:50:40.880
I am not.

1175
01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:44.714
Will you promise never
to enter into such an engagement?

1176
01:50:44.888 --> 01:50:47.095
I will not and I certainly never shall.

1177
01:50:48.976 --> 01:50:51.265
You have insulted me
in every possible way

1178
01:50:51.478 --> 01:50:54.230
and can now have
nothing further to say.

1179
01:50:55.524 --> 01:50:58.229
I must ask you to leave immediately.

1180
01:51:00.529 --> 01:51:01.857
Goodnight.

1181
01:51:03.866 --> 01:51:07.614
I have never been thus treated
in my entire life!

1182
01:51:08.829 --> 01:51:12.328
- What is going on?
- Just a small misunderstanding.

1183
01:51:12.499 --> 01:51:15.749
For once in your life,
leave me alone!

1184
01:54:05.297 --> 01:54:08.132
- I couldn't sleep.
- Nor I. My aunt...

1185
01:54:08.300 --> 01:54:11.467
Yes, she was here.

1186
01:54:11.637 --> 01:54:14.804
How can I ever make amends
for such behaviour?

1187
01:54:14.973 --> 01:54:17.346
After what you've done for Lydia

1188
01:54:17.518 --> 01:54:20.851
and, I suspect, for Jane,
it is I who should be making amends.

1189
01:54:22.106 --> 01:54:26.981
You must know.
Surely you must know it was all for you.

1190
01:54:29.446 --> 01:54:32.613
You are too generous to trifle with me.

1191
01:54:32.783 --> 01:54:36.199
You spoke with my aunt last night
and it has taught me to hope

1192
01:54:36.370 --> 01:54:39.075
as I'd scarcely allowed myself before.

1193
01:54:40.541 --> 01:54:45.582
If your feelings are still what they
were last April, tell me so at once.

1194
01:54:45.754 --> 01:54:48.755
My affections and wishes
have not changed.

1195
01:54:48.966 --> 01:54:52.133
But one word from you
will silence me for ever.

1196
01:54:57.349 --> 01:55:01.643
lf, however,
your feelings have changed...

1197
01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:06.646
...I would have to tell you,

1198
01:55:06.859 --> 01:55:09.694
you have bewitched me,
body and soul, and I love...

1199
01:55:09.862 --> 01:55:12.946
I love... I love you.

1200
01:55:13.115 --> 01:55:16.069
I never wish to be parted
from you from this day on.

1201
01:55:27.755 --> 01:55:29.463
Well, then.

1202
01:55:34.386 --> 01:55:37.056
Your hands are cold.

1203
01:56:21.392 --> 01:56:23.349
Shut the door, please.

1204
01:56:34.279 --> 01:56:39.784
Lizzie, are you out of your senses?
I thought you hated the man.

1205
01:56:39.952 --> 01:56:44.993
- No, Papa.
- He is rich, to be sure.

1206
01:56:45.207 --> 01:56:49.039
And you will have
more fine carriages than Jane.

1207
01:56:49.211 --> 01:56:51.667
But will that make you happy?

1208
01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:55.961
Have you no other objection
than your belief in my indifference?

1209
01:56:56.135 --> 01:56:58.341
None at all.

1210
01:56:58.512 --> 01:57:03.388
We all know him to be
a proud, unpleasant sort of fellow.

1211
01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:05.973
But this would be nothing
if you liked him.

1212
01:57:06.145 --> 01:57:07.853
I do like him.

1213
01:57:10.274 --> 01:57:11.816
I love him.

1214
01:57:14.945 --> 01:57:19.654
He's not proud. I was wrong.
I was entirely wrong about him.

1215
01:57:23.037 --> 01:57:26.370
You don't know him, Papa.
If I told you what he was really like,

1216
01:57:26.582 --> 01:57:27.744
what he's done...

1217
01:57:28.751 --> 01:57:30.790
What has he done?

1218
01:57:38.886 --> 01:57:42.634
But she doesn't like him.
I thought she didn't like him.

1219
01:57:42.848 --> 01:57:46.513
So did I. So did we all.

1220
01:57:46.685 --> 01:57:49.390
We must have been wrong.

1221
01:57:49.563 --> 01:57:55.103
- It won't be the first time, will it?
- No, nor the last, I dare say.

1222
01:58:00.616 --> 01:58:02.407
Good Lord.

1223
01:58:05.037 --> 01:58:09.082
- I must pay him back.
- No.

1224
01:58:09.249 --> 01:58:12.832
You mustn't tell anyone.
He wouldn't want it.

1225
01:58:13.045 --> 01:58:17.339
We misjudged him, Papa.
Me more than anyone. In every way.

1226
01:58:17.549 --> 01:58:20.883
Not just in this matter.

1227
01:58:21.053 --> 01:58:23.722
I've been nonsensical.

1228
01:58:23.889 --> 01:58:28.847
But he's been a fool about Jane,
about so many other things.

1229
01:58:29.061 --> 01:58:32.477
But then, so have I.

1230
01:58:35.401 --> 01:58:38.152
You see, he and I are...

1231
01:58:40.406 --> 01:58:43.572
He and I are so similar.

1232
01:58:43.784 --> 01:58:47.118
We're both so stubborn.

1233
01:58:48.789 --> 01:58:50.497
Papa, I...

1234
01:58:54.461 --> 01:58:56.833
You really do love him, don't you?

1235
01:58:58.298 --> 01:59:00.587
Very much.

1236
01:59:05.014 --> 01:59:10.767
I cannot believe
that anyone can deserve you.

1237
01:59:10.936 --> 01:59:15.148
But it seems I am overruled.

1238
01:59:15.315 --> 01:59:19.942
So I heartily give my consent.

1239
01:59:28.329 --> 01:59:33.204
I could not have parted with you,
my Lizzie, to anyone less worthy.

1240
01:59:36.545 --> 01:59:37.541
Thank you.

1241
01:59:51.518 --> 01:59:56.145
If any young men come for Mary or Kitty,
for heaven's sake, send them in.

1242
01:59:56.357 --> 01:59:58.894
I'm quite at my leisure.
