WEBVTT

1
00:02:12.174 --> 00:02:13.758
Lydia. Kitty.

2
00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:53.296
My dear Mr Bennet,
have you heard?

3
00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:55.924
Netherfield Park is let at last.

4
00:02:56.384 --> 00:02:58.301
Do you not want to know who has taken it?

5
00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:00.428
As you wish to tell me, my dear,

6
00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:03.139
I doubt I have any choice in the matter.

7
00:03:10.105 --> 00:03:13.273
Liddy, Kitty, what have I told you
about listening at the door?

8
00:03:13.358 --> 00:03:15.192
Never mind that. There's a Mr Bingley

9
00:03:15.276 --> 00:03:16.819
- arrived from the North.
- Perchance.

10
00:03:16.903 --> 00:03:19.238
- £5,000 a year.
- Really?

11
00:03:19.864 --> 00:03:20.864
- He's single.
- He's single.

12
00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:22.116
- Who's single?
- A Mr Bingley, apparently.

13
00:03:23.284 --> 00:03:24.326
Kitty.

14
00:03:24.411 --> 00:03:26.412
And how can that possibly affect them?

15
00:03:26.496 --> 00:03:28.706
Oh, Mr Bennet, how can you be so tiresome?

16
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.166
You know he must marry one of them.

17
00:03:31.292 --> 00:03:33.502
So that is his design
in settling here.

18
00:03:33.586 --> 00:03:35.587
You must go and visit him at once.

19
00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:38.841
Good heavens. People.

20
00:03:41.552 --> 00:03:45.513
For we may not visit if you do not,
as you well know, Mr Bennet.

21
00:03:45.597 --> 00:03:46.973
Aren't you listening? You never listen.

22
00:03:47.057 --> 00:03:48.182
You must, Papa.

23
00:03:48.267 --> 00:03:49.517
At once.

24
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.979
There's no need, I already have.

25
00:03:53.772 --> 00:03:54.897
- Have?
- When?

26
00:03:55.315 --> 00:03:58.943
Oh, Mr Bennet, how can you tease me so?

27
00:03:59.278 --> 00:04:01.696
Have you no compassion for my poor nerves?

28
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.322
You mistake me, my dear.

29
00:04:03.407 --> 00:04:05.533
I have the highest respect for them.

30
00:04:05.617 --> 00:04:07.535
They've been my constant companions

31
00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:09.037
these 20 years.

32
00:04:09.121 --> 00:04:10.246
Papa.

33
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.539
- Is he amiable?
- Who?

34
00:04:11.623 --> 00:04:13.249
- Is he handsome?
Who?

35
00:04:13.333 --> 00:04:14.541
He's sure to be handsome.

36
00:04:14.625 --> 00:04:16.334
With £5,000 a year, it would not matter

37
00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.086
- if he had warts and a leer.
- Who's got warts?

38
00:04:18.171 --> 00:04:19.671
I will give my hearty consent

39
00:04:19.756 --> 00:04:22.424
to his marrying whichever
of the girls he chooses.

40
00:04:22.508 --> 00:04:25.177
So will he come to the ball tomorrow, Papa?

41
00:04:26.262 --> 00:04:27.471
I believe so.

42
00:04:29.057 --> 00:04:30.932
Can I wear your spotted muslin?
Oh, please, Jane.

43
00:04:31.017 --> 00:04:32.309
No, I need it.

44
00:04:32.393 --> 00:04:33.727
Please, Jane, I'll lend you my green slippers.

45
00:04:33.811 --> 00:04:34.853
- They were mine.
- Oh, were they?

46
00:04:34.937 --> 00:04:36.480
Well, then I'll do your mending for a week.

47
00:04:36.564 --> 00:04:37.731
I'll re-trim your new bonnet.

48
00:04:37.815 --> 00:04:39.983
- Two weeks.
- And I'll pay you myself, Jane.

49
00:04:40.068 --> 00:04:42.235
- Jane, look at me. Jane.
But I want to wear it myself.

50
00:05:32.785 --> 00:05:34.619
I can't breathe.

51
00:05:37.206 --> 00:05:39.749
I think one of my toes just came off.

52
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.593
Now, if every man in the room
does not end the evening

53
00:05:50.678 --> 00:05:53.096
in love with you, then I'm no judge of beauty.

54
00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.432
- Or men.
- No, they are far too easy to judge.

55
00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.892
They're not all bad.

56
00:05:58.018 --> 00:06:00.853
Humourless poppycocks, in my limited experience.

57
00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:03.397
One of these days, Lizzie,
someone will catch your eye

58
00:06:03.565 --> 00:06:05.899
and then you'll have to watch your tongue.

59
00:06:27.255 --> 00:06:28.922
How good of you to come.

60
00:06:29.007 --> 00:06:31.258
So, which of the painted peacocks
is our Mr Bingley?

61
00:06:31.342 --> 00:06:34.219
Well, he's on the right,
and on the left is his sister.

62
00:06:34.303 --> 00:06:35.845
And the person with the quizzical brow?

63
00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:38.431
That is his good friend,
Mr Darcy.

64
00:06:38.515 --> 00:06:40.850
He looks miserable, poor soul.

65
00:06:40.934 --> 00:06:44.437
Miserable, he may be,
but poor, he most certainly is not.

66
00:06:44.521 --> 00:06:46.147
- Tell me.
- £10,000 a year

67
00:06:46.231 --> 00:06:48.107
and he owns half of Derbyshire.

68
00:06:48.233 --> 00:06:49.942
The miserable half?

69
00:06:54.239 --> 00:06:56.490
He's about the best butcher in the county.

70
00:06:58.368 --> 00:07:01.120
If I could introduce
the ladies in the choir.

71
00:07:17.261 --> 00:07:19.971
Mr Bennet, you must introduce him to the girls.

72
00:07:20.056 --> 00:07:21.473
Immediately.

73
00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:25.602
Smile. Smile at Mr Bingley. Smile.

74
00:07:41.953 --> 00:07:43.078
Mary.

75
00:07:43.287 --> 00:07:46.622
Mr Bingley, my eldest daughter you know.

76
00:07:46.873 --> 00:07:49.375
Mrs Bennet,
Miss Jane Bennet,

77
00:07:49.459 --> 00:07:51.752
Elizabeth and Miss Mary Bennet.

78
00:07:51.836 --> 00:07:53.170
It is a pleasure.

79
00:07:53.546 --> 00:07:56.215
I have two others, but they're already dancing.

80
00:07:56.299 --> 00:07:58.217
I'm delighted to make your acquaintance.

81
00:07:58.301 --> 00:08:01.470
And may I introduce
Mr Darcy of Pemberley

82
00:08:01.554 --> 00:08:02.972
in Derbyshire.

83
00:08:17.195 --> 00:08:18.279
Yes.

84
00:08:23.617 --> 00:08:25.785
How do you like it here
in Hertfordshire, Mr Bingley?

85
00:08:25.869 --> 00:08:27.120
Very much.

86
00:08:27.871 --> 00:08:28.955
The library at Netherfield,

87
00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:30.748
I've heard, is one of the finest in the country.

88
00:08:30.833 --> 00:08:33.626
Yes, it fills me with guilt.
I'm not a very good reader, you see.

89
00:08:33.711 --> 00:08:35.837
I prefer being out of doors.

90
00:08:35.921 --> 00:08:38.464
I mean, I can read, of course.

91
00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:39.757
And I'm not suggesting

92
00:08:39.842 --> 00:08:42.468
you can't read out of doors, of course.

93
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.678
I wish I read more,

94
00:08:43.762 --> 00:08:45.805
but there always seems to be
so many other things to do.

95
00:08:45.889 --> 00:08:47.223
Yes, that's exactly what I meant.

96
00:08:51.562 --> 00:08:53.021
Mama. Mama.

97
00:08:53.105 --> 00:08:55.772
You will never, ever, ever believe
what we're about to tell you.

98
00:08:55.857 --> 00:08:58.108
- Well, tell me quickly, my love.
- She's going to take the veil.

99
00:08:58.192 --> 00:08:59.651
- The regiments are coming.
- The regiments are coming.

100
00:08:59.736 --> 00:09:00.736
Officers.

101
00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.696
They're to be stationed the whole winter.

102
00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.323
Stationed in the village, just right there.

103
00:09:04.407 --> 00:09:05.449
Officers.

104
00:09:05.533 --> 00:09:07.159
- As far as the eye can see.
- Officers!

105
00:09:13.416 --> 00:09:16.460
Oh, look, Jane's dancing with Mr Bingley.

106
00:09:17.587 --> 00:09:18.962
Mr Bennet.

107
00:09:33.226 --> 00:09:35.561
- Do you dance, Mr Darcy?
- Not if I can help it.

108
00:09:56.541 --> 00:09:59.835
I didn't know you were coming
to see me. What's the matter?

109
00:10:00.128 --> 00:10:02.046
We are a long way from Grosvenor Square,

110
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.964
are we not, Mr Darcy?

111
00:10:05.341 --> 00:10:07.592
I've never seen so many pretty girls in my life.

112
00:10:07.676 --> 00:10:09.761
You were dancing with
the only handsome girl in the room.

113
00:10:09.845 --> 00:10:13.139
She is the most beautiful creature
I have ever beheld.

114
00:10:13.557 --> 00:10:15.809
But her sister, Elizabeth, is very agreeable.

115
00:10:15.893 --> 00:10:17.936
Perfectly tolerable, I dare say,

116
00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.813
but not handsome enough to tempt me.

117
00:10:20.106 --> 00:10:22.524
You'd better return to your partner
and enjoy her smiles.

118
00:10:22.608 --> 00:10:24.609
You're wasting your time with me.

119
00:10:29.115 --> 00:10:30.824
Count your blessings, Lizzie.

120
00:10:30.908 --> 00:10:33.326
If he liked you, you'd have to talk to him.

121
00:10:33.994 --> 00:10:35.328
Precisely.

122
00:10:35.663 --> 00:10:37.956
As it is, I wouldn't dance with him
for all of Derbyshire,

123
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.206
let alone the miserable half.

124
00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:19.829
I nearly went the wrong way.

125
00:11:43.353 --> 00:11:44.562
Wait.

126
00:12:01.454 --> 00:12:05.332
- I enjoyed that so much!
- How well you dance.

127
00:12:05.416 --> 00:12:07.000
Mrs Bennet, I've enjoyed this better

128
00:12:07.084 --> 00:12:10.086
than any other dance I've been to before.

129
00:12:10.171 --> 00:12:12.214
Jane is a splendid dancer, is she not?

130
00:12:12.298 --> 00:12:13.715
Oh, she is indeed.

131
00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:18.970
Your friend, Miss Lucas,
is a most amusing young woman.

132
00:12:19.055 --> 00:12:20.722
Oh, yes. I adore her.

133
00:12:20.932 --> 00:12:23.849
It is a pity
she's not more handsome.

134
00:12:24.184 --> 00:12:25.184
Mama.

135
00:12:25.268 --> 00:12:28.062
But Lizzie will never admit that she's plain.

136
00:12:29.314 --> 00:12:32.441
Of course, it's my Jane who is considered

137
00:12:32.526 --> 00:12:34.026
- the beauty of the county.
No, Mama. Mama, please.

138
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.070
When she was only 15 there was a gentleman

139
00:12:36.154 --> 00:12:38.781
so much in love with her that I was sure

140
00:12:38.865 --> 00:12:40.157
he would make her an offer.

141
00:12:40.242 --> 00:12:43.911
However, he did write her
some very pretty verses.

142
00:12:43.995 --> 00:12:45.329
And that put paid to it.

143
00:12:45.413 --> 00:12:47.248
I wonder who first discovered
the power of poetry

144
00:12:47.332 --> 00:12:48.874
in driving away love?

145
00:12:48.959 --> 00:12:50.584
I thought that poetry was the food of love.

146
00:12:50.669 --> 00:12:52.461
Of a fine, stout love, it may.

147
00:12:52.587 --> 00:12:54.088
But if it is only a vague inclination,

148
00:12:54.172 --> 00:12:56.465
I'm convinced one poor sonnet
will kill it stone dead.

149
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:59.551
So what do you recommend to encourage affection?

150
00:13:00.219 --> 00:13:01.469
Dancing.

151
00:13:02.429 --> 00:13:05.223
Even if one's partner is barely tolerable.

152
00:13:28.664 --> 00:13:31.791
Mr Bingley is just what a young man ought to be.

153
00:13:32.585 --> 00:13:35.002
- Sensible, good humoured...
- Handsome, conveniently rich.

154
00:13:35.086 --> 00:13:36.878
You know perfectly well
I do not believe marriage

155
00:13:36.963 --> 00:13:38.839
- should be driven by a lot of money.
- I agree entirely.

156
00:13:38.923 --> 00:13:40.966
Only the deepest love
will persuade me into matrimony,

157
00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:43.093
which is why I will end up an old maid.

158
00:13:43.177 --> 00:13:45.095
Do you really believe he liked me, Lizzie?

159
00:13:45.179 --> 00:13:47.431
Jane, he danced with you most of the night

160
00:13:47.515 --> 00:13:49.600
and stared at you for the rest of it.

161
00:13:49.851 --> 00:13:52.894
But I give you leave to like him.
You've liked many a stupider person.

162
00:13:52.979 --> 00:13:56.273
Now, you're a great deal too apt
to like people in general, you know.

163
00:13:56.399 --> 00:13:58.609
All the world is good and agreeable
in your eyes.

164
00:13:58.693 --> 00:13:59.943
Not his friend.

165
00:14:00.111 --> 00:14:02.112
Oh, I still can't believe
what he said about you.

166
00:14:02.238 --> 00:14:03.572
Mr Darcy?

167
00:14:04.699 --> 00:14:08.535
I could more easily forgive
his vanity had he not wounded mine.

168
00:14:09.578 --> 00:14:12.413
But no matter.
I doubt we shall ever speak again.

169
00:14:43.819 --> 00:14:45.820
And then he danced the third
with Miss Lucas.

170
00:14:45.905 --> 00:14:47.072
We were all there, dear.

171
00:14:47.198 --> 00:14:50.367
Oh, poor thing. It is a shame
she's not more handsome.

172
00:14:50.451 --> 00:14:53.203
There's a spinster in the making and no mistake.

173
00:14:53.371 --> 00:14:55.872
The fourth, with a Miss King,
of little standing,

174
00:14:55.956 --> 00:14:58.208
and the fifth, again with Jane.

175
00:14:58.292 --> 00:14:59.542
If he'd had any compassion for me

176
00:14:59.627 --> 00:15:01.503
he would have sprained his ankle
in the first set.

177
00:15:01.587 --> 00:15:03.672
Mr Bennet, the way you carry on,
anyone would think

178
00:15:03.756 --> 00:15:06.341
our girls look forward to a grand inheritance.

179
00:15:06.509 --> 00:15:09.219
When you die, Mr Bennet,
which may in fact be very soon,

180
00:15:09.303 --> 00:15:11.596
our girls will be left
without a roof over their head

181
00:15:11.681 --> 00:15:13.223
nor a penny to their name.

182
00:15:13.307 --> 00:15:15.350
Oh, Mama, please, it's 10:00 in the morning.

183
00:15:15.434 --> 00:15:17.435
A letter addressed to Miss Bennet, ma'am,

184
00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.395
from Netherfield Hall.

185
00:15:21.064 --> 00:15:22.648
Praise the Lord.

186
00:15:23.441 --> 00:15:24.858
We are saved.

187
00:15:26.111 --> 00:15:27.695
Make haste,
Jane, make haste.

188
00:15:27.779 --> 00:15:29.113
Oh, happy day.

189
00:15:31.491 --> 00:15:33.575
It is from Caroline Bingley.

190
00:15:34.285 --> 00:15:36.704
She has invited me to dine with her.

191
00:15:39.124 --> 00:15:40.958
Her brother will be dining out.

192
00:15:41.126 --> 00:15:42.251
Dining out?

193
00:15:42.335 --> 00:15:44.545
- Can I take the carriage?
- Where? Let me see that.

194
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:45.796
It is too far to walk, Mama.

195
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.215
This is unaccountable of him.
Dining out, indeed.

196
00:15:48.299 --> 00:15:50.008
Mama. The carriage? For Jane?

197
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:53.928
Certainly not.

198
00:15:54.555 --> 00:15:56.305
She'll go on horseback.

199
00:15:56.849 --> 00:15:58.433
- Horseback?
- Horseback?

200
00:16:14.283 --> 00:16:15.366
Lizzie.

201
00:16:16.618 --> 00:16:19.954
Now she'll have to stay the night.
Exactly as I predicted.

202
00:16:20.122 --> 00:16:21.247
Good grief, woman.

203
00:16:21.331 --> 00:16:24.709
Your skills in the art of
matchmaking are positively occult.

204
00:16:25.252 --> 00:16:26.335
Though I don't think, Mama,

205
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.337
you can reasonably take credit
for making it rain.

206
00:16:34.719 --> 00:16:37.763
"My kind friends will not hear
of me returning home until I am better.

207
00:16:37.847 --> 00:16:40.182
"Do not be alarmed.
Excepting a sore throat, a fever

208
00:16:40.266 --> 00:16:42.476
"and a headache, there is
nothing much wrong with me."

209
00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:43.852
This is ridiculous.

210
00:16:43.936 --> 00:16:45.604
Well, if Jane does die,

211
00:16:45.688 --> 00:16:48.023
it will be a comfort to know
it was in pursuit of Mr Bingley.

212
00:16:48.107 --> 00:16:50.692
People do not die of colds.

213
00:16:50.777 --> 00:16:54.154
Though she may well perish
with the shame of having such a mother.

214
00:16:55.364 --> 00:16:57.407
I must go to Netherfield at once.

215
00:17:11.379 --> 00:17:14.089
Apparently, Lady Bathurst
is redecorating her ballroom

216
00:17:14.174 --> 00:17:15.966
in the French style.

217
00:17:16.301 --> 00:17:18.552
A little unpatriotic, don't you think?

218
00:17:21.932 --> 00:17:23.849
Miss Elizabeth Bennet.

219
00:17:38.739 --> 00:17:41.407
Good Lord, Miss Elizabeth.
Did you walk here?

220
00:17:41.617 --> 00:17:42.826
I did.

221
00:17:50.292 --> 00:17:53.002
- I'm so sorry. How is my sister?
- She's upstairs.

222
00:17:56.715 --> 00:17:58.049
Thank you.

223
00:18:08.435 --> 00:18:10.854
My goodness,
did you see her hem?

224
00:18:11.105 --> 00:18:15.440
Six inches deep in mud.
She looked positively medieval.

225
00:18:16.276 --> 00:18:20.320
I feel such a terrible imposition,
they're being so kind to me.

226
00:18:20.446 --> 00:18:22.239
Don't worry.
I don't know who is more pleased

227
00:18:22.323 --> 00:18:24.908
at your being here, Mama or Mr Bingley.

228
00:18:27.328 --> 00:18:28.370
Oh.

229
00:18:31.624 --> 00:18:33.542
Thank you for tending to my sister
so diligently.

230
00:18:33.626 --> 00:18:36.336
She is in far better comfort here
than she would have been at home.

231
00:18:36.421 --> 00:18:37.963
It's a pleasure.

232
00:18:38.923 --> 00:18:39.923
I mean it's... Sorry.

233
00:18:40.008 --> 00:18:42.301
Not a pleasure that she's ill, of course not.

234
00:18:42.468 --> 00:18:45.304
It's a pleasure that she's here, being ill.

235
00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.475
Not going to be famous, our pig.

236
00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.896
Back of the back, not related
to the learnt pig of Norwich.

237
00:18:55.606 --> 00:18:56.564
Now, that pig is...

238
00:18:56.648 --> 00:18:57.732
- Mr Bennet.
- Yes.

239
00:18:58.483 --> 00:19:00.318
It's all going according to plan.

240
00:19:00.402 --> 00:19:02.028
He's half in love with her already.

241
00:19:02.112 --> 00:19:04.405
- Who is, blossom?
- Mr Bingley.

242
00:19:04.489 --> 00:19:06.449
And he doesn't mind a bit
that she hasn't a penny,

243
00:19:06.533 --> 00:19:08.701
for he has more than enough for the two of them.

244
00:19:09.119 --> 00:19:11.329
How will we meet them?
It's easy.

245
00:19:11.496 --> 00:19:12.747
Wait for me.

246
00:19:12.998 --> 00:19:17.460
You drop something, they pick it up,
and then you're introduced.

247
00:19:26.135 --> 00:19:27.427
Officers.

248
00:19:59.292 --> 00:20:02.544
You write uncommonly fast, Mr Darcy.

249
00:20:02.796 --> 00:20:04.838
You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.

250
00:20:04.965 --> 00:20:08.384
How many letters you must have
occasion to write, Mr Darcy.

251
00:20:08.718 --> 00:20:11.762
Letters of business, too.
How odious I should think them.

252
00:20:11.846 --> 00:20:13.681
It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot

253
00:20:13.765 --> 00:20:14.807
instead of yours.

254
00:20:14.891 --> 00:20:17.309
Do tell your sister that I long to see her.

255
00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.144
I've already told her once, by your desire.

256
00:20:19.229 --> 00:20:20.813
I do dote on her.

257
00:20:20.939 --> 00:20:22.022
I was quite in raptures

258
00:20:22.107 --> 00:20:24.441
at her beautiful little design for a table.

259
00:20:24.567 --> 00:20:26.819
Perhaps you will give me leave
to defer your raptures

260
00:20:26.903 --> 00:20:27.945
till I write again?

261
00:20:28.029 --> 00:20:29.738
At present, I have not room enough
to do them justice.

262
00:20:29.823 --> 00:20:31.490
Well, I think it's amazing
you young ladies

263
00:20:31.574 --> 00:20:33.366
have the patience to be so accomplished.

264
00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:34.826
What do you mean, Charles?

265
00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:37.286
You all paint tables and play the piano

266
00:20:37.371 --> 00:20:39.247
and embroider cushions.

267
00:20:39.373 --> 00:20:42.083
I never heard of a young lady
but people say she is accomplished.

268
00:20:42.167 --> 00:20:43.960
The word is indeed applied
too liberally.

269
00:20:44.044 --> 00:20:46.212
I cannot boast of knowing more than
half a dozen women

270
00:20:46.296 --> 00:20:48.172
in all my acquaintance
that are truly accomplished.

271
00:20:48.257 --> 00:20:49.674
Nor I, to be sure.

272
00:20:49.758 --> 00:20:52.593
Goodness. You must comprehend
a great deal in the idea.

273
00:20:52.928 --> 00:20:54.595
- I do.
Absolutely.

274
00:20:55.097 --> 00:20:57.974
She must have a thorough knowledge
of music, singing, drawing,

275
00:20:58.058 --> 00:21:01.269
dancing and the modern languages,
to deserve the word.

276
00:21:02.104 --> 00:21:05.398
And something in her air and manner of walking.

277
00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:09.109
And, of course, she must improve
her mind by extensive reading.

278
00:21:09.193 --> 00:21:12.237
I'm no longer surprised at your
knowing only six accomplished women.

279
00:21:12.321 --> 00:21:14.448
I rather wonder now at your knowing any.

280
00:21:14.532 --> 00:21:18.285
- Are you so severe on your own sex?
- I never saw such a woman.

281
00:21:19.162 --> 00:21:21.288
She would certainly be
a fearsome thing to behold.

282
00:21:24.042 --> 00:21:27.252
Miss Elizabeth,
let us take a turn about the room.

283
00:21:44.561 --> 00:21:46.437
It's refreshing, is it not,

284
00:21:46.521 --> 00:21:49.065
after sitting so long in one attitude?

285
00:21:49.524 --> 00:21:52.109
And it is a small kind
of accomplishment, I suppose.

286
00:21:52.778 --> 00:21:54.987
Will you not join us, Mr Darcy?

287
00:21:55.197 --> 00:21:57.281
You can only have two motives, Caroline,

288
00:21:57.365 --> 00:21:58.908
and I would interfere with either.

289
00:21:58.992 --> 00:22:00.242
What can he mean?

290
00:22:00.327 --> 00:22:03.996
Our surest way of disappointing him
will be to ask him nothing about it.

291
00:22:04.122 --> 00:22:05.998
But do tell us, Mr Darcy.

292
00:22:09.377 --> 00:22:11.212
Either you are in each other's confidence

293
00:22:11.296 --> 00:22:14.131
and you have secret affairs to discuss,

294
00:22:14.216 --> 00:22:16.967
or you are conscious that your figures

295
00:22:17.177 --> 00:22:19.761
appear to the greatest advantage by walking.

296
00:22:21.263 --> 00:22:23.932
If the first, I should get in your way.

297
00:22:24.225 --> 00:22:26.476
If the second, I can admire you
much better from here.

298
00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.560
Shocking.

299
00:22:28.687 --> 00:22:30.271
How shall we punish him for such a speech?

300
00:22:30.356 --> 00:22:31.439
We could always laugh at him.

301
00:22:31.524 --> 00:22:34.150
Oh, no, Mr Darcy is not to be teased.

302
00:22:34.401 --> 00:22:36.486
Are you too proud, Mr Darcy?

303
00:22:36.821 --> 00:22:38.947
And would you consider pride
a fault or a virtue?

304
00:22:39.031 --> 00:22:40.156
That I couldn't say.

305
00:22:40.241 --> 00:22:42.200
Because we're doing our best
to find fault in you.

306
00:22:42.284 --> 00:22:43.785
Maybe it's that I find it hard to forgive

307
00:22:43.869 --> 00:22:46.871
the follies and vices of others,
or their of fences against me.

308
00:22:47.331 --> 00:22:50.166
My good opinion, once lost, is lost forever.

309
00:22:52.877 --> 00:22:55.462
Oh, dear, I cannot tease you about that.

310
00:22:56.464 --> 00:22:58.799
What a shame, for I dearly love to laugh.

311
00:22:58.925 --> 00:23:00.884
A family trait, I think.

312
00:23:29.413 --> 00:23:31.372
A Mrs Bennet, a Miss Bennet,

313
00:23:31.456 --> 00:23:34.542
a Miss Bennet, and a Miss Bennet, sir.

314
00:23:34.626 --> 00:23:36.043
Oh, for heaven's sake, are we to receive

315
00:23:36.128 --> 00:23:38.087
every Bennet in the country?

316
00:23:40.632 --> 00:23:43.551
What an excellent room you have, sir.

317
00:23:44.261 --> 00:23:46.888
Such expensive furnishings.

318
00:23:47.931 --> 00:23:50.975
Oh, I do hope you intend
to stay here, Mr Bingley.

319
00:23:51.059 --> 00:23:53.769
Absolutely. I find the country very diverting.

320
00:23:54.354 --> 00:23:55.771
Don't you agree, Darcy?

321
00:23:56.148 --> 00:23:58.107
I find it perfectly adequate,

322
00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.110
even if society's
a little less varied than in town.

323
00:24:01.195 --> 00:24:03.028
Less varied? Not at all.

324
00:24:03.196 --> 00:24:06.865
We dine with four and twenty
families of all shapes and sizes.

325
00:24:07.408 --> 00:24:11.411
Sir William Lucas, for instance,
is a very agreeable man

326
00:24:12.079 --> 00:24:15.916
and a good deal less self-important
than some people half his rank.

327
00:24:16.834 --> 00:24:18.793
Mr Bingley, is it true
that you've promised

328
00:24:18.878 --> 00:24:21.296
- to hold a ball here at Netherfield?
- A ball?

329
00:24:21.631 --> 00:24:23.798
It would be an excellent way
to meet new friends.

330
00:24:23.883 --> 00:24:26.426
You could invite the militia.
They're excellent company.

331
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:28.511
- Oh, do hold a ball.
Kitty.

332
00:24:29.805 --> 00:24:32.390
When your sister is recovered,
you shall name the day.

333
00:24:32.475 --> 00:24:34.726
I think a ball is a perfectly irrational way

334
00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:36.311
to gain new acquaintance.

335
00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.396
It would be better if conversation,
instead of dancing,

336
00:24:39.481 --> 00:24:40.814
were the order of the day.

337
00:24:40.899 --> 00:24:44.026
Indeed, much more rational,
but rather less like a ball.

338
00:24:45.028 --> 00:24:46.654
Thank you, Mary.

339
00:24:47.822 --> 00:24:51.867
What a fine, imposing place
it is, to be sure, is it not, my dears?

340
00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.037
There's no house to equal it in the county.

341
00:24:55.705 --> 00:24:57.414
- Mr Darcy.
- Miss Bennet.

342
00:24:57.499 --> 00:24:58.791
There she is.

343
00:24:59.084 --> 00:25:00.668
Mr Bingley, I don't know how to thank you.

344
00:25:00.752 --> 00:25:03.462
You're welcome any time
you feel the least bit poorly.

345
00:25:03.713 --> 00:25:05.339
Thank you for your stimulating company.

346
00:25:05.423 --> 00:25:06.924
It has been most instructive.

347
00:25:07.008 --> 00:25:09.426
Not at all. The pleasure is all mine.

348
00:25:13.389 --> 00:25:15.515
- Mr Darcy.
- Miss Elizabeth.

349
00:25:27.528 --> 00:25:30.905
And then, there was one
with great long lashes like a cow.

350
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:32.782
Did you see him?
He looked right at me.

351
00:25:32.866 --> 00:25:35.618
Ask Mrs Hill
to order us a sirloin, Betsy.

352
00:25:35.703 --> 00:25:38.204
Just the one, mind, we're not made of money.

353
00:25:41.542 --> 00:25:44.836
I hope, my dear,
you've ordered a good dinner today.

354
00:25:45.587 --> 00:25:49.089
I have reason to expect an addition
to our family party.

355
00:25:49.757 --> 00:25:52.092
His name is Mr Collins.
He's the dreaded cousin.

356
00:25:52.176 --> 00:25:55.137
Who's to inherit.
- Indeed. Everything, apparently.

357
00:25:55.221 --> 00:25:57.973
Even my piano stool belongs to Mr Collins.

358
00:25:58.057 --> 00:25:59.099
When?

359
00:25:59.183 --> 00:26:01.184
He may turn us out of the house
as soon as he pleases.

360
00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:02.519
But why?

361
00:26:02.603 --> 00:26:05.981
Because the estate passes directly
to him and not to us poor females.

362
00:26:11.279 --> 00:26:13.363
Mr Collins, at your service.

363
00:26:22.831 --> 00:26:26.917
What a superbly featured room
and what excellent boiled potatoes.

364
00:26:27.878 --> 00:26:31.297
Many years since I've had
such an exemplary vegetable.

365
00:26:32.299 --> 00:26:33.424
To which of my fair cousins

366
00:26:33.508 --> 00:26:35.968
should I compliment the excellence
of the cooking?

367
00:26:36.053 --> 00:26:39.221
Mr Collins, we are perfectly able
to keep a cook.

368
00:26:39.306 --> 00:26:40.639
Excellent.

369
00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:44.268
I'm very pleased
the estate can afford such a living.

370
00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.149
I am honoured to have as my patroness,

371
00:26:50.233 --> 00:26:51.901
Lady Catherine de Bourg.

372
00:26:51.985 --> 00:26:53.778
You've heard of her, I presume?

373
00:26:54.821 --> 00:26:58.865
My small rectory abuts her estate,

374
00:26:58.949 --> 00:27:01.868
Rosings Park, and she often condescends

375
00:27:01.952 --> 00:27:06.664
to drive by my humble dwelling
in her little phaeton and ponies.

376
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:09.542
Does she have any family?

377
00:27:09.627 --> 00:27:13.546
One daughter, the heiress of Rosings
and very extensive property.

378
00:27:14.757 --> 00:27:16.674
I've often observed to Lady Catherine

379
00:27:16.759 --> 00:27:19.886
that her daughter seemed born to be a duchess,

380
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:24.307
for she has all the superior graces
of elevated rank.

381
00:27:25.643 --> 00:27:27.727
These are the kind of
little delicate compliments

382
00:27:27.812 --> 00:27:29.437
which are always acceptable to the ladies

383
00:27:29.522 --> 00:27:34.149
and which I conceive myself
particularly bound to pay.

384
00:27:34.943 --> 00:27:36.944
How happy for you, Mr Collins,

385
00:27:37.028 --> 00:27:40.656
to possess the talent for flattering
with such delicacy.

386
00:27:42.659 --> 00:27:44.868
Do these pleasing attentions proceed from

387
00:27:44.953 --> 00:27:46.412
the impulse of the moment

388
00:27:46.496 --> 00:27:48.872
or are they the result of previous study?

389
00:27:48.998 --> 00:27:51.250
They arise chiefly
from what is passing at the time,

390
00:27:51.334 --> 00:27:52.918
and though I do sometimes amuse myself

391
00:27:53.002 --> 00:27:55.546
with arranging such little elegant compliments,

392
00:27:56.214 --> 00:28:00.467
I always wish to give them
as unstudied an air as possible.

393
00:28:01.511 --> 00:28:04.221
Believe me, no one would suspect
your manners to be rehearsed.

394
00:28:10.853 --> 00:28:14.063
After dinner I thought I might read
to you all for an hour or two.

395
00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.316
I have with me Fordyce's Sermons

396
00:28:17.818 --> 00:28:20.653
which speak very eloquently
on all matters moral.

397
00:28:23.115 --> 00:28:25.366
Are you familiar
with Fordyce's Sermons, Miss Bennet?

398
00:28:31.957 --> 00:28:34.667
Mrs Bennet, you do know that I've been bestowed

399
00:28:34.751 --> 00:28:36.919
by the good grace of Lady Catherine de Bourg

400
00:28:37.004 --> 00:28:39.338
a parsonage of no mean size.

401
00:28:39.465 --> 00:28:41.799
I have become aware of the fact.

402
00:28:41.884 --> 00:28:44.009
Well, it is my avowed hope that soon

403
00:28:44.093 --> 00:28:47.429
I may find a mistress for it
and I have to inform you

404
00:28:47.513 --> 00:28:52.350
that the eldest Miss Bennet
has captured my special attention.

405
00:28:53.895 --> 00:28:55.437
Oh, Mr Collins,

406
00:28:56.439 --> 00:29:00.692
unfortunately, it is incumbent upon me

407
00:29:00.776 --> 00:29:03.778
to hint that the eldest Miss Bennet

408
00:29:03.863 --> 00:29:06.907
is very soon to be engaged.

409
00:29:07.116 --> 00:29:08.408
Engaged?

410
00:29:08.701 --> 00:29:11.161
But Miss Lizzie, next to her
in both age and beauty,

411
00:29:11.245 --> 00:29:13.914
would make anyone an excellent partner.

412
00:29:14.916 --> 00:29:18.417
Do not you agree, Mr Collins?

413
00:29:19.169 --> 00:29:20.419
Indeed.

414
00:29:22.047 --> 00:29:23.088
Indeed.

415
00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:26.175
Very agreeable alternative.

416
00:29:48.198 --> 00:29:49.490
Mr Collins is the sort of man

417
00:29:49.574 --> 00:29:51.617
who makes you despair at the entire sex.

418
00:29:51.701 --> 00:29:53.243
Yours, I believe.

419
00:29:54.411 --> 00:29:56.955
Mr Wickham, how perfect you are.

420
00:29:57.039 --> 00:29:58.206
He picked up my handkerchief, too.

421
00:29:58.290 --> 00:29:59.624
Did you drop yours on purpose, Lizzie?

422
00:29:59.708 --> 00:30:03.002
Mr Wickham's a lieutenant.
- An enchanted lieutenant.

423
00:30:03.087 --> 00:30:04.212
What are you up to, Liddy?

424
00:30:04.296 --> 00:30:06.047
We just happened to be looking
for some ribbon.

425
00:30:06.131 --> 00:30:07.549
White, for the ball.

426
00:30:07.633 --> 00:30:10.134
Shall we all look for some ribbon together?

427
00:30:13.639 --> 00:30:16.432
Good afternoon, Mr James.
Good afternoon, Miss Lydia.

428
00:30:16.517 --> 00:30:18.518
Miss Bennet.
- I shan't even browse.

429
00:30:18.686 --> 00:30:21.646
I can't be trusted.
I have very poor taste in ribbons.

430
00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:24.399
Only a man truly confident
of himself would admit to that.

431
00:30:24.483 --> 00:30:27.026
No, it's true. And buckles.

432
00:30:27.111 --> 00:30:29.361
When it comes to buckles, I'm lost.

433
00:30:29.445 --> 00:30:31.780
Dear, oh, dear. You must be
the shame of the regiment.

434
00:30:31.864 --> 00:30:34.575
- A laughingstock.
- What do your superiors do with you?

435
00:30:37.495 --> 00:30:38.829
Ignore me.

436
00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:42.332
I'm of next to no importance,
so it's easily done.

437
00:30:42.917 --> 00:30:44.710
Lizzie, lend me some money.

438
00:30:44.794 --> 00:30:46.712
You already owe me a fortune, Liddy.

439
00:30:46.963 --> 00:30:50.382
- Allow me to oblige.
Oh, no, Mr Wickham, please.

440
00:30:55.847 --> 00:30:57.180
I insist.

441
00:31:01.603 --> 00:31:03.603
- I pity the French.
What are they talking about?

442
00:31:03.687 --> 00:31:04.729
So do I, miserable bunch.
- I don't know.

443
00:31:04.813 --> 00:31:07.481
- Look, Mr Bingley.
- Mr Bingley!

444
00:31:07.566 --> 00:31:09.233
I was just on my way to your house.

445
00:31:09.318 --> 00:31:12.153
Mr Bingley, how do you like
my ribbons for your ball?

446
00:31:13.447 --> 00:31:14.655
Very beautiful.

447
00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:16.907
She is. Look at her. She's blooming.

448
00:31:16.992 --> 00:31:18.200
Oh, Lydia.

449
00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:22.371
Be sure to invite Mr Wickham,
he is a credit to his profession.

450
00:31:22.456 --> 00:31:25.124
Lydia, you can't invite people
to other people's balls.

451
00:31:27.085 --> 00:31:29.378
Of course you must come, Mr Wickham.

452
00:31:29.504 --> 00:31:32.340
If you'll excuse me, ladies. Enjoy the day.

453
00:31:35.927 --> 00:31:38.303
Do you plan to go to the
Netherfield ball, then, Mr Wickham?

454
00:31:39.221 --> 00:31:40.388
Perhaps.

455
00:31:41.015 --> 00:31:43.725
How long has Mr Darcy been a guest there?

456
00:31:44.935 --> 00:31:46.311
About a month.

457
00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:50.315
Forgive me, but are you acquainted with him?

458
00:31:51.025 --> 00:31:52.567
With Mr Darcy?

459
00:31:52.735 --> 00:31:56.154
Indeed. I've been connected
with his family since infancy.

460
00:31:57.323 --> 00:31:59.908
You may well be surprised, Miss Elizabeth,

461
00:32:00.076 --> 00:32:03.078
especially given our cold greeting
this afternoon.

462
00:32:04.997 --> 00:32:07.666
Well, I hope that your plans
in favour of Meryton

463
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:09.959
will not be affected by
your relations with the gentleman.

464
00:32:10.044 --> 00:32:12.544
Oh, no, it is not for me to be driven away.

465
00:32:12.754 --> 00:32:15.756
If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go,

466
00:32:16.257 --> 00:32:17.424
not I.

467
00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.135
I must ask, Mr Wickham,

468
00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.763
what is the manner
of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?

469
00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:28.102
My father managed his estate.

470
00:32:29.104 --> 00:32:31.522
We grew up together, Darcy and I.

471
00:32:32.607 --> 00:32:35.025
His father treated me like a second son.

472
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:36.902
Loved me like a son.

473
00:32:38.697 --> 00:32:41.281
We were both with him the day he died.

474
00:32:43.201 --> 00:32:45.035
With his last breath,

475
00:32:45.704 --> 00:32:48.621
his father bequeathed me
the rectory in his estate.

476
00:32:48.914 --> 00:32:51.958
He knew I had my heart set
on joining the church.

477
00:32:52.292 --> 00:32:55.795
But Darcy ignored his wishes
and gave the living to another man.

478
00:32:55.921 --> 00:32:58.381
- But why?
- Jealousy.

479
00:33:00.759 --> 00:33:02.301
His father...

480
00:33:03.971 --> 00:33:06.472
Well, he loved me better
and Darcy couldn't stand it.

481
00:33:07.725 --> 00:33:10.476
- How cruel.
- So now, I'm a poor foot soldier,

482
00:33:10.602 --> 00:33:12.812
too lowly even to be noticed.

483
00:33:24.824 --> 00:33:25.824
Oh!

484
00:33:25.908 --> 00:33:29.536
- Breathe in.
- I can't any more. You're hurting.

485
00:33:33.666 --> 00:33:34.750
Betsy.

486
00:33:35.877 --> 00:33:36.877
Betsy.

487
00:33:48.723 --> 00:33:50.766
I still think there must have been
a misunderstanding.

488
00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:52.809
Oh, Jane, do you never think ill of anybody?

489
00:33:52.894 --> 00:33:55.353
Well, how could Mr Darcy do such a thing?

490
00:33:56.897 --> 00:33:58.814
I'll discover the truth from Mr Bingley

491
00:33:58.899 --> 00:33:59.940
at the ball this evening.

492
00:34:00.025 --> 00:34:02.943
If it is not true,
let Mr Darcy contradict it himself.

493
00:34:03.111 --> 00:34:05.321
Till he does, I hope never to encounter him.

494
00:34:05.405 --> 00:34:07.656
Poor, unfortunate Mr Wickham.

495
00:34:08.033 --> 00:34:10.493
On the contrary,
Wickham is twice the man Darcy is.

496
00:34:10.577 --> 00:34:12.703
And let us hope, a rather more willing dancer.

497
00:34:19.377 --> 00:34:21.003
Oh, there they are. Look.

498
00:34:30.222 --> 00:34:32.222
Jane Martin is here tonight.

499
00:35:00.042 --> 00:35:02.418
May I say what an immense pleasure it is

500
00:35:02.503 --> 00:35:04.754
- to see you again, Mr Bingley.
- Mrs Bennet.

501
00:35:05.047 --> 00:35:07.047
- Miss Bingley.
- Charming.

502
00:35:09.926 --> 00:35:13.220
- I'm so pleased you're here.
- So am I.

503
00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:15.806
And how are you?

504
00:35:17.141 --> 00:35:19.601
Miss Elizabeth, are you looking for someone?

505
00:35:19.686 --> 00:35:21.812
No. No, not at all.

506
00:35:21.896 --> 00:35:24.022
I was just admiring the general splendour.

507
00:35:24.274 --> 00:35:26.525
It is breath-taking, Mr Bingley.

508
00:35:26.609 --> 00:35:27.734
Good.

509
00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:40.247
You might at least have
passed a few pleasantries with Mr Bingley.

510
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:43.249
I dare say I've never met
a more pleasant gentleman

511
00:35:43.333 --> 00:35:44.709
in all my years.

512
00:35:44.793 --> 00:35:46.878
Did you see how he dotes on her?

513
00:35:47.379 --> 00:35:50.965
Dear Jane. Always doing
what's best for her family.

514
00:36:09.651 --> 00:36:11.402
- Charlotte.
- Lizzie.

515
00:36:11.695 --> 00:36:15.740
- Have you seen Mr Wickham?
- No, perhaps he is through here.

516
00:36:28.836 --> 00:36:31.129
Lizzie. Mr Wickham is not here.

517
00:36:31.547 --> 00:36:33.173
Apparently he's been detained.

518
00:36:33.466 --> 00:36:36.343
Detained where? He must be here.

519
00:36:36.761 --> 00:36:38.178
There you are.

520
00:36:38.596 --> 00:36:39.971
Mr Collins.

521
00:36:41.182 --> 00:36:44.059
Perhaps you will do me the honour,
Miss Elizabeth?

522
00:36:46.646 --> 00:36:49.022
I did not think you danced, Mr Collins.

523
00:36:49.106 --> 00:36:51.316
I do not think it incompatible
with the office of a clergyman

524
00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.776
to indulge in such an innocent diversion.

525
00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:56.737
In fact, several people, well,
Her Ladyship included,

526
00:36:56.821 --> 00:37:00.407
have complimented me on my lightness of foot.

527
00:37:25.642 --> 00:37:27.058
Apparently, your Mr Wickham

528
00:37:27.142 --> 00:37:29.268
has been called on some business to town.

529
00:37:33.607 --> 00:37:35.650
To be sure, dancing is of
little consequence to me,

530
00:37:35.734 --> 00:37:37.402
but it does...

531
00:37:38.612 --> 00:37:40.822
It does harbour the opportunity to lavish...

532
00:37:45.744 --> 00:37:46.869
To lavish upon one's partner...

533
00:37:46.954 --> 00:37:47.954
And my informer tells me

534
00:37:48.038 --> 00:37:49.038
that he would have been less inclined...

535
00:37:49.123 --> 00:37:50.164
...delicate attentions which is my...

536
00:37:50.249 --> 00:37:52.166
That he'd be less inclined to be engaged,

537
00:37:52.251 --> 00:37:53.668
were it not for the...

538
00:37:55.295 --> 00:37:56.337
Were it not for the presence

539
00:37:56.422 --> 00:37:57.797
at Netherfield of a certain gentleman.

540
00:37:57.881 --> 00:37:59.465
Which is my primary object of the evening.

541
00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:01.633
That gentleman barely warrants the name.

542
00:38:02.927 --> 00:38:05.971
It is my intention, if I may be so bold,

543
00:38:06.055 --> 00:38:08.765
to remain close to you throughout the evening.

544
00:38:23.114 --> 00:38:25.574
May I have the next dance, Miss Elizabeth?

545
00:38:25.742 --> 00:38:26.992
You may.

546
00:38:37.794 --> 00:38:39.503
Did I just agree to dance with Mr Darcy?

547
00:38:39.588 --> 00:38:41.797
I daresay you will find him
very amiable, Lizzie.

548
00:38:41.882 --> 00:38:43.340
It would be most inconvenient,

549
00:38:43.425 --> 00:38:45.593
since I have sworn
to loathe him for all eternity.

550
00:39:02.027 --> 00:39:04.820
- I love this dance.
- Indeed. Most invigorating.

551
00:39:10.035 --> 00:39:12.285
It is your turn to say something, Mr Darcy.

552
00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:16.372
I talked about the dance,
now you ought to remark

553
00:39:16.457 --> 00:39:19.209
on the size of the room
or the number of couples.

554
00:39:20.669 --> 00:39:22.045
I am perfectly happy to oblige.

555
00:39:22.129 --> 00:39:24.839
Please advise me
of what you would like most to hear.

556
00:39:24.924 --> 00:39:27.008
That reply will do for present.

557
00:39:30.513 --> 00:39:33.139
Perhaps by and by,
I may observe that private balls

558
00:39:33.224 --> 00:39:35.517
are much pleasanter than public ones.

559
00:39:38.479 --> 00:39:40.438
For now we may remain silent.

560
00:39:49.405 --> 00:39:51.990
Do you talk, as a rule, while dancing?

561
00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:53.700
No.

562
00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:56.995
No, I prefer to be unsociable and taciturn.

563
00:40:00.542 --> 00:40:03.669
Makes it all so much more enjoyable,
don't you think?

564
00:40:06.464 --> 00:40:10.134
Tell me, do you and your sisters
very often walk to Meryton?

565
00:40:13.096 --> 00:40:15.264
Yes, we often walk to Meryton.

566
00:40:16.599 --> 00:40:19.393
It's a great opportunity to meet new people.

567
00:40:21.187 --> 00:40:23.146
In fact, when you met us,
we'd just had the pleasure

568
00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:25.356
of forming a new acquaintance.

569
00:40:27.234 --> 00:40:29.652
Mr Wickham is blessed with such happy manners

570
00:40:29.736 --> 00:40:31.988
he is sure of making friends.

571
00:40:32.072 --> 00:40:34.115
Whether he's capable
of retaining them is less certain.

572
00:40:34.199 --> 00:40:37.535
He's been so unfortunate
as to lose your friendship.

573
00:40:38.662 --> 00:40:40.496
And I daresay that is an irreversible event?

574
00:40:40.581 --> 00:40:43.207
It is. Why do you ask
such a question?

575
00:40:43.292 --> 00:40:44.709
To make out your character, Mr Darcy.

576
00:40:44.793 --> 00:40:47.295
- And what have you discovered?
- Very little.

577
00:40:47.379 --> 00:40:51.090
I hear such different accounts
of you as puzzle me exceedingly.

578
00:40:52.301 --> 00:40:55.178
I hope to afford you more clarity in the future.

579
00:41:41.473 --> 00:41:43.515
Is that Mr Darcy of Pemberley in Derbyshire?

580
00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:44.558
I believe so.

581
00:41:44.643 --> 00:41:46.352
I must make myself known to him immediately.

582
00:41:46.436 --> 00:41:47.686
- But, sir.
- He is the nephew of my esteemed

583
00:41:47.771 --> 00:41:49.021
patroness, Lady Catherine.

584
00:41:49.105 --> 00:41:52.149
Mr Collins, he will consider it an impertinence.

585
00:41:52.817 --> 00:41:54.068
Mr Darcy.

586
00:41:55.528 --> 00:41:56.654
Mr Darcy.

587
00:41:58.823 --> 00:41:59.865
Mr Darcy.

588
00:42:01.952 --> 00:42:02.952
Good evening.

589
00:42:03.036 --> 00:42:06.287
What interesting relatives you have,
Miss Elizabeth.

590
00:42:06.497 --> 00:42:08.414
I believe we have
a mutual acquaintance

591
00:42:08.499 --> 00:42:11.501
in the personage of Lady Catherine de Bourg?

592
00:42:24.181 --> 00:42:27.558
Mary dear, you've delighted us long enough.

593
00:42:27.851 --> 00:42:30.478
Let the other young ladies have a turn.

594
00:42:33.983 --> 00:42:37.110
I had her since I was a child
and then she died.

595
00:42:37.194 --> 00:42:39.153
Now I have a beautiful grey.

596
00:42:39.238 --> 00:42:42.572
Of course, Caroline's a much better
rider than I am. Of course.

597
00:42:46.536 --> 00:42:51.290
Oh, yes, we fully expect
a most advantageous marriage.

598
00:42:52.667 --> 00:42:54.293
And my Jane marrying this young man

599
00:42:54.377 --> 00:42:56.920
must throw her sisters in the way
of other rich men.

600
00:43:18.859 --> 00:43:20.609
Clearly my family are having a competition

601
00:43:20.694 --> 00:43:23.612
to see who can expose themselves
to the most ridicule.

602
00:43:24.197 --> 00:43:26.657
Well, at least Bingley has not noticed.

603
00:43:26.742 --> 00:43:30.911
- No. I think he likes her very much.
- But does she like him?

604
00:43:31.621 --> 00:43:33.539
There are few of us who are secure enough

605
00:43:33.623 --> 00:43:36.125
to be really in love
without proper encouragement.

606
00:43:36.209 --> 00:43:38.461
Bingley likes her enormously

607
00:43:38.545 --> 00:43:41.672
but might not do more
if she does not help him on.

608
00:43:41.757 --> 00:43:43.632
But she's just shy and modest.

609
00:43:43.717 --> 00:43:45.509
If he cannot perceive her regard, he is a fool.

610
00:43:45.594 --> 00:43:47.636
We are all fools in love.

611
00:43:48.221 --> 00:43:51.097
He does not know her character as we do.

612
00:43:51.432 --> 00:43:53.850
She should move fast, snap him up.

613
00:43:53.934 --> 00:43:56.186
There is plenty of time for us
to get to know them

614
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:58.104
after we're married.

615
00:43:58.773 --> 00:44:01.024
Can't help feeling
that at any point this evening

616
00:44:01.108 --> 00:44:04.277
someone's going to produce a piglet
and make us chase it.

617
00:44:11.952 --> 00:44:12.994
Oh, dear.

618
00:44:13.079 --> 00:44:16.873
I do apologise, sir.
I'm awfully sorry.

619
00:44:16.957 --> 00:44:18.375
Do forgive me.

620
00:44:42.315 --> 00:44:43.649
Mary.

621
00:44:43.858 --> 00:44:45.025
There, there. There, there, there.

622
00:44:47.153 --> 00:44:50.280
- I've been practising it all week.
I know, my dear.

623
00:44:50.365 --> 00:44:51.907
I hate balls!

624
00:45:11.802 --> 00:45:13.678
Mr Bennet, wake up.

625
00:45:14.221 --> 00:45:18.349
Oh, I've never had such
a good time in my life.

626
00:45:20.853 --> 00:45:23.187
Charles, you cannot be serious.

627
00:45:31.196 --> 00:45:33.322
We'll be having a wedding here at Netherfield

628
00:45:33.407 --> 00:45:36.741
in less than three months,
if you ask me, Mr Bennet.

629
00:45:38.995 --> 00:45:40.370
Mr Bennet!

630
00:45:46.419 --> 00:45:48.211
Mary, please.

631
00:45:57.221 --> 00:45:58.889
Thank you, Mr Hill.

632
00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:18.782
Mrs Bennet,

633
00:46:18.867 --> 00:46:21.368
I was hoping, if it would not
trouble you, that I might solicit

634
00:46:21.453 --> 00:46:22.995
a private audience with Miss Elizabeth

635
00:46:23.079 --> 00:46:25.372
in the course of the morning.

636
00:46:26.041 --> 00:46:28.209
Oh, yes. Certainly.

637
00:46:28.752 --> 00:46:32.463
Lizzie will be very happy indeed.
Everyone, out.

638
00:46:32.964 --> 00:46:35.674
Mr Collins would like a private
audience with your sister.

639
00:46:35.759 --> 00:46:36.842
No, no, wait, please. I beg you.

640
00:46:36.927 --> 00:46:38.302
Mr Collins can have nothing to say to me

641
00:46:38.386 --> 00:46:40.346
- that anybody need not hear.
- No nonsense, Lizzie.

642
00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:42.431
I desire you will stay where you are.

643
00:46:42.516 --> 00:46:44.350
Everyone else to the drawing room.

644
00:46:44.559 --> 00:46:46.017
- Mr Bennet?
- But...

645
00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:47.435
Now.

646
00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:51.064
Jane. Jane.

647
00:46:51.148 --> 00:46:52.315
Jane, please, don't.

648
00:46:52.399 --> 00:46:53.399
- Jane?
- Jane.

649
00:46:57.321 --> 00:46:59.656
Papa, stay.

650
00:47:26.432 --> 00:47:28.308
Dear Miss Elizabeth,

651
00:47:28.685 --> 00:47:32.145
I am sure my attentions have been
too marked to be mistaken.

652
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:34.731
Almost as soon as I entered the house,

653
00:47:34.816 --> 00:47:38.193
I singled you out as the companion
of my future life.

654
00:47:40.154 --> 00:47:42.906
But before I am run away with my feelings,

655
00:47:42.991 --> 00:47:45.867
perhaps I may state my reasons for marrying.

656
00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:48.453
Firstly, that it is the duty of a clergyman

657
00:47:48.538 --> 00:47:51.331
to set the example of matrimony in his parish.

658
00:47:51.416 --> 00:47:55.377
Secondly, that I am convinced
it will add greatly to my happiness.

659
00:47:55.461 --> 00:47:58.921
And thirdly, that it is at the urging

660
00:47:59.006 --> 00:48:01.591
of my esteemed patroness, Lady Catherine,

661
00:48:02.175 --> 00:48:03.926
that I select a wife.

662
00:48:04.845 --> 00:48:08.389
My object in coming to Longbourn
was to choose such a one

663
00:48:08.473 --> 00:48:10.141
from among Mr Bennet's daughters,

664
00:48:10.225 --> 00:48:14.103
for I am to inherit the estate,

665
00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:17.273
and such an alliance will surely

666
00:48:18.025 --> 00:48:19.358
suit everyone.

667
00:48:22.029 --> 00:48:24.530
And now, nothing remains but for me

668
00:48:24.615 --> 00:48:26.991
to assure you in the most animated language,

669
00:48:27.075 --> 00:48:28.284
of the violence of my affections.

670
00:48:28.368 --> 00:48:29.493
Mr Collins.

671
00:48:29.578 --> 00:48:31.745
And that no reproach on the subject of fortune

672
00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:33.455
will cross my lips once we're married.

673
00:48:33.539 --> 00:48:36.166
You are too hasty, sir. You forget
that I have given no answer.

674
00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:39.336
I must add that Lady Catherine
will thoroughly approve

675
00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:43.048
when I speak to her of your modesty,
economy, and other

676
00:48:44.175 --> 00:48:45.550
amiable qualities.

677
00:48:45.635 --> 00:48:50.221
Sir, I am honoured by your proposal,
but I regret that I must decline it.

678
00:48:51.807 --> 00:48:55.393
I know ladies don't seek to seem too eager...

679
00:48:55.478 --> 00:48:58.021
Mr Collins, I am perfectly serious.

680
00:48:58.105 --> 00:48:59.898
You could not make me happy and I'm convinced

681
00:48:59.982 --> 00:49:03.234
I'm the last woman in the world
who could make you happy.

682
00:49:03.319 --> 00:49:05.153
I flatter myself, cousin, that your refusal

683
00:49:05.237 --> 00:49:07.363
is merely a natural delicacy.

684
00:49:08.073 --> 00:49:09.615
Besides, you should take into account

685
00:49:09.699 --> 00:49:11.325
that despite the manifold attractions,

686
00:49:11.409 --> 00:49:13.535
it is by no means certain
that another offer of marriage

687
00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:15.245
- may ever be made to you.
- Mr Collins.

688
00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:16.330
So I must conclude

689
00:49:16.414 --> 00:49:19.041
that you simply seek
to increase my love by suspense...

690
00:49:19.125 --> 00:49:20.167
Sir.

691
00:49:20.251 --> 00:49:22.086
...according to the usual practise
of elegant females.

692
00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:23.170
Sir.

693
00:49:24.047 --> 00:49:27.633
I am not the sort of female
to torment a respectable man.

694
00:49:27.717 --> 00:49:30.552
Please understand me, I cannot accept you.

695
00:49:37.477 --> 00:49:40.104
Headstrong, foolish child.

696
00:49:48.612 --> 00:49:50.446
Don't worry, Mr Collins.

697
00:49:50.531 --> 00:49:53.950
We'll have this little hiccup
dealt with immediately.

698
00:49:55.452 --> 00:49:56.744
Lizzie!

699
00:49:57.830 --> 00:49:59.122
Lizzie!

700
00:50:03.293 --> 00:50:05.795
Mr Bennet. Mr Bennet.

701
00:50:05.879 --> 00:50:07.547
We're all in an uproar.

702
00:50:07.631 --> 00:50:10.758
You must come and make Lizzie marry Mr Collins.

703
00:50:11.552 --> 00:50:15.887
Mr Collins has proposed to Lizzie.
But she vows she will not have him.

704
00:50:16.222 --> 00:50:20.392
And now the danger is
Mr Collins may not have Lizzie.

705
00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:24.479
- Well, what am I to do?
- Well, come and talk to her.

706
00:50:26.065 --> 00:50:27.149
Now.

707
00:50:39.996 --> 00:50:42.038
Tell her you insist upon them marrying.

708
00:50:42.123 --> 00:50:43.123
Papa, please.

709
00:50:43.207 --> 00:50:44.958
- You will have this house.
- I can't marry him.

710
00:50:45.042 --> 00:50:46.418
And save your sisters from destitution.

711
00:50:46.502 --> 00:50:47.544
I can't.

712
00:50:47.628 --> 00:50:50.255
Go back now and say you've changed your mind!

713
00:50:50.338 --> 00:50:51.881
- No!
- Think of your family!

714
00:50:51.965 --> 00:50:55.176
- You cannot make me!
- Mr Bennet, say something!

715
00:50:57.971 --> 00:50:59.138
So,

716
00:50:59.765 --> 00:51:03.350
your mother insists on you marrying Mr Collins.

717
00:51:03.435 --> 00:51:05.936
Yes, or I shall never see her again.

718
00:51:06.021 --> 00:51:08.272
Well, Lizzie, from this day onward,

719
00:51:08.356 --> 00:51:10.107
you must be a stranger to one of your parents.

720
00:51:10.192 --> 00:51:11.984
Who will maintain you when your father is dead?

721
00:51:12.068 --> 00:51:15.780
Your mother will never see you again
if you do not marry Mr Collins,

722
00:51:15.864 --> 00:51:18.616
and I will never see you again if you do.

723
00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:21.118
- Mr Bennet!
- Thank you, Papa.

724
00:51:25.331 --> 00:51:29.584
Ungrateful child.
I shall never speak to you again!

725
00:51:30.377 --> 00:51:33.046
Not that I take
much pleasure in talking.

726
00:51:33.923 --> 00:51:36.883
People who suffer as I do
from nervous complaints

727
00:51:36.967 --> 00:51:39.552
can have no pleasure in talking to anybody.

728
00:51:40.054 --> 00:51:41.262
Jane.

729
00:51:45.017 --> 00:51:46.559
What's the matter?

730
00:51:48.354 --> 00:51:49.395
Jane?

731
00:52:44.116 --> 00:52:47.493
I don't understand what would
take him from Netherfield.

732
00:52:47.661 --> 00:52:49.620
Why would he not know when he was to return?

733
00:52:49.705 --> 00:52:50.913
Read it. I don't mind.

734
00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:02.383
"Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister,

735
00:53:02.467 --> 00:53:04.927
"and we are scarcely less eager
to meet her again.

736
00:53:05.012 --> 00:53:06.721
"I really do not think Georgiana Darcy

737
00:53:06.805 --> 00:53:09.390
"has her equal for beauty, elegance,
and accomplishments,

738
00:53:09.474 --> 00:53:12.100
"so much so I must hope
to hereafter call her my sister."

739
00:53:12.184 --> 00:53:14.269
Is that not clear enough?

740
00:53:15.062 --> 00:53:17.772
Caroline sees that her brother
is in love with you

741
00:53:17.857 --> 00:53:20.609
and has taken him off to persuade him otherwise.

742
00:53:20.693 --> 00:53:24.446
But I know her to be incapable
of wilfully deceiving anyone.

743
00:53:25.781 --> 00:53:27.949
It's far more likely that he doesn't
love me and never has.

744
00:53:28.034 --> 00:53:30.493
He loves you, Jane. Do not give up.

745
00:53:32.830 --> 00:53:34.956
Go to our aunt and uncle's in London,

746
00:53:35.041 --> 00:53:38.960
let it be known you are there,
and I am sure he will come to you.

747
00:53:48.678 --> 00:53:52.848
Give my love to my sister
and try not to be a burden, dear.

748
00:53:53.683 --> 00:53:55.059
Poor Jane.

749
00:53:55.727 --> 00:53:59.355
Still, a girl likes to be
crossed in love now and then.

750
00:54:00.315 --> 00:54:02.399
It gives her something to think of,

751
00:54:02.484 --> 00:54:05.736
and a sort of distinction
amongst her companions.

752
00:54:05.862 --> 00:54:07.529
I'm sure that will cheer her up, Papa.

753
00:54:07.614 --> 00:54:09.823
Well, it's your turn now, Lizzie.

754
00:54:09.908 --> 00:54:11.992
You turned down Collins.

755
00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:15.120
You're free to go off and be jilted yourself.

756
00:54:16.373 --> 00:54:18.374
What about Mr Wickham?

757
00:54:18.458 --> 00:54:20.917
Well, he's a pleasant fellow
and he'd do the job credibly.

758
00:54:21.001 --> 00:54:22.043
Father.

759
00:54:22.127 --> 00:54:24.796
And you have an affectionate mother,

760
00:54:25.047 --> 00:54:27.215
who would make the most of it.

761
00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:50.446
- Charlotte.
- My dear Lizzie.

762
00:54:51.073 --> 00:54:53.282
I've come here to tell you the news.

763
00:54:53.367 --> 00:54:55.909
Mr Collins and I are engaged.

764
00:54:56.411 --> 00:54:57.911
- Engaged?
- Yes.

765
00:55:02.959 --> 00:55:04.001
To be married?

766
00:55:04.085 --> 00:55:07.796
Yes, of course, Lizzie,
what other kind of engaged is there?

767
00:55:09.424 --> 00:55:12.676
Oh, for heaven's sake, Lizzie,
don't look at me like that.

768
00:55:13.011 --> 00:55:14.219
There was no earthly reason

769
00:55:14.303 --> 00:55:16.555
why I shouldn't be as happy with him
as any other.

770
00:55:16.639 --> 00:55:19.182
- But he's ridiculous.
- Oh, hush.

771
00:55:19.267 --> 00:55:21.893
Not all of us can afford to be romantic.

772
00:55:23.271 --> 00:55:26.606
I've been offered a comfortable home
and protection.

773
00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:29.026
- There's a lot to be thankful for.
- Charlotte...

774
00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:30.901
I'm 27 years old.

775
00:55:31.862 --> 00:55:34.321
I've no money and no prospects.

776
00:55:34.614 --> 00:55:37.116
I'm already a burden to my parents.

777
00:55:38.368 --> 00:55:39.952
And I'm frightened.

778
00:55:41.079 --> 00:55:44.331
So don't judge me, Lizzie.
Don't you dare judge me.

779
00:56:38.052 --> 00:56:40.886
Dear Charlotte,
thank you for your letter.

780
00:56:42.222 --> 00:56:45.599
I am so glad the house, furniture,
and roads are all to your taste

781
00:56:45.683 --> 00:56:49.144
and that Lady Catherine's behaviour
is friendly and obliging.

782
00:56:49.229 --> 00:56:52.022
What with your departure, Jane's to London,

783
00:56:52.107 --> 00:56:55.567
and the militia to the North
with the colourful Mr Wickham,

784
00:56:55.693 --> 00:56:59.571
I must confess, the view from
where I sit has been rather grey.

785
00:56:59.781 --> 00:57:02.741
As for the favour you ask,
it is no favour at all.

786
00:57:03.034 --> 00:57:06.370
I would be happy to visit you
at your earliest convenience.

787
00:57:13.711 --> 00:57:15.795
Welcome to our humble abode.

788
00:57:21.301 --> 00:57:23.678
My wife encourages me to spend
as much time in the garden

789
00:57:23.762 --> 00:57:25.096
as possible for the sake of my health.

790
00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:27.682
My dear, I think our guest is tired
after her journey.

791
00:57:27.766 --> 00:57:29.225
I plan many improvements, of course.

792
00:57:29.309 --> 00:57:32.353
I intend to throw out a bough
and plant a lime walk.

793
00:57:32.437 --> 00:57:34.147
Oh, yes, I flatter myself

794
00:57:34.231 --> 00:57:38.192
that any young lady would be happy
to be the mistress of such a house.

795
00:57:39.903 --> 00:57:42.071
We shan't be disturbed here.

796
00:57:42.406 --> 00:57:45.408
This parlour is for my own particular use.

797
00:57:48.412 --> 00:57:52.080
Oh, Lizzie, it's such a pleasure
to run my own home.

798
00:57:52.707 --> 00:57:54.249
Charlotte, come here.

799
00:57:54.333 --> 00:57:55.834
- What's happened?
- Charlotte!

800
00:57:55.918 --> 00:57:57.335
Has the pig escaped again?

801
00:57:58.504 --> 00:58:01.089
Oh, it's Lady Catherine.
Come and see, Lizzie.

802
00:58:02.758 --> 00:58:05.218
Great news. Great news.

803
00:58:05.386 --> 00:58:07.721
We've received an invitation
to visit Rosings this evening

804
00:58:07.805 --> 00:58:08.972
from Lady Catherine de Bourg.

805
00:58:09.056 --> 00:58:10.432
How wonderful.

806
00:58:11.142 --> 00:58:13.894
Do not make yourself uneasy,
my dear cousin, about your apparel.

807
00:58:13.978 --> 00:58:16.354
Just put on whatever you've brought that's best.

808
00:58:16.439 --> 00:58:19.441
Lady Catherine's never been averse
to the truly humble.

809
00:58:22.028 --> 00:58:25.446
One of the most extraordinary sights
in all of Europe, is it not?

810
00:58:25.530 --> 00:58:28.657
The glazing alone cost upwards of £20,000.

811
00:58:29.159 --> 00:58:31.619
Come along. Come along.

812
00:58:40.462 --> 00:58:43.380
I think
a little later we'll play cards.

813
00:58:43.965 --> 00:58:45.507
Your Ladyship.

814
00:58:47.427 --> 00:58:48.802
Miss de Bourg.

815
00:59:08.906 --> 00:59:10.990
So you are Elizabeth Bennet?

816
00:59:11.116 --> 00:59:12.784
I am, Your Ladyship.

817
00:59:12.993 --> 00:59:14.077
Hmm.

818
00:59:15.996 --> 00:59:17.664
This is my daughter.

819
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.125
It's very kind of you

820
00:59:21.210 --> 00:59:24.462
- to ask us to dine, Lady Catherine.
- The rug alone cost upwards of £300.

821
00:59:27.258 --> 00:59:28.675
Mr Darcy.

822
00:59:30.219 --> 00:59:32.095
What are you doing here?

823
00:59:34.681 --> 00:59:37.474
Mr Darcy, I had no idea we had the honour.

824
00:59:39.769 --> 00:59:42.229
Miss Elizabeth, I'm a guest here.

825
00:59:43.898 --> 00:59:45.691
You know my nephew?

826
00:59:46.526 --> 00:59:48.277
Yes, ma'am, I had the pleasure

827
00:59:48.361 --> 00:59:50.821
of meeting your nephew in Hertfordshire.

828
00:59:50.905 --> 00:59:52.906
Colonel Fitzwilliam. How do you do?

829
00:59:58.496 --> 01:00:02.207
Mr Collins, you can't sit
next to your wife. Move.

830
01:00:03.126 --> 01:00:04.418
Over there.

831
01:00:20.726 --> 01:00:24.061
Harvey, I wonder,
could you get me a fish course?

832
01:00:24.730 --> 01:00:28.190
I trust your family is
in good health, Miss Elizabeth?

833
01:00:28.817 --> 01:00:30.484
They are, thank you.

834
01:00:34.823 --> 01:00:36.532
My eldest sister is currently in London,

835
01:00:36.616 --> 01:00:38.659
perhaps you happened to see her there?

836
01:00:38.744 --> 01:00:40.286
I haven't been fortunate enough, no.

837
01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:42.997
Do you play the pianoforte, Miss Bennet?

838
01:00:44.874 --> 01:00:46.750
A little, ma'am, and very poorly.

839
01:00:48.336 --> 01:00:49.753
Do you draw?

840
01:00:50.421 --> 01:00:51.921
No, not at all.

841
01:00:52.715 --> 01:00:54.632
Your sisters, do they draw?

842
01:00:55.134 --> 01:00:57.594
- Not one.
- That's very strange.

843
01:00:58.679 --> 01:01:00.930
I suppose you had no opportunity.

844
01:01:01.182 --> 01:01:03.350
Your mother should've taken you
to town every spring

845
01:01:03.434 --> 01:01:04.893
for the benefit of the masters.

846
01:01:04.977 --> 01:01:08.813
I'm sure my mother wouldn't have
minded, but my father hates town.

847
01:01:09.482 --> 01:01:12.942
- Has your governess left you?
- We never had a governess.

848
01:01:14.278 --> 01:01:15.779
No governess?

849
01:01:16.447 --> 01:01:18.615
Five daughters brought up at home
without a governess.

850
01:01:18.699 --> 01:01:20.657
I never heard such a thing.

851
01:01:20.742 --> 01:01:23.369
Your mother must have been
quite a slave to your education.

852
01:01:23.453 --> 01:01:25.079
Not at all, Lady Catherine.

853
01:01:30.043 --> 01:01:32.378
Your younger sisters, are they out in society?

854
01:01:32.462 --> 01:01:33.754
Yes, ma'am. All.

855
01:01:33.838 --> 01:01:36.215
All? What, all five out at once?

856
01:01:36.299 --> 01:01:39.259
Oh, that's very odd.
And you only the second.

857
01:01:39.636 --> 01:01:42.137
The younger ones out
before the elders are married.

858
01:01:42.222 --> 01:01:45.182
Your youngest sisters must be very young.

859
01:01:45.475 --> 01:01:47.643
Yes, my youngest is not 16.

860
01:01:48.478 --> 01:01:50.521
But I think it would be very hard
on younger sisters

861
01:01:50.605 --> 01:01:52.022
not to have their share of amusement

862
01:01:52.107 --> 01:01:54.149
because the elder is still unmarried.

863
01:01:54.234 --> 01:01:57.193
It would hardly encourage sisterly affection.

864
01:01:57.403 --> 01:01:58.444
Upon my word,

865
01:01:58.529 --> 01:02:01.489
you give your opinion very decidedly
for so young a person.

866
01:02:02.658 --> 01:02:04.450
Pray, what is your age?

867
01:02:05.619 --> 01:02:07.036
With three younger sisters grown up,

868
01:02:07.121 --> 01:02:09.414
Your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own to it.

869
01:02:19.842 --> 01:02:22.343
Come, Miss Bennet, and play for us.

870
01:02:22.719 --> 01:02:23.845
No, I beg you.

871
01:02:23.929 --> 01:02:25.972
For music is my delight.

872
01:02:26.432 --> 01:02:28.766
In fact there are few people in England

873
01:02:28.851 --> 01:02:32.185
who have more true enjoyment
of music than myself,

874
01:02:32.770 --> 01:02:34.521
or better natural taste.

875
01:02:35.523 --> 01:02:37.315
If I had ever learnt,

876
01:02:37.525 --> 01:02:40.193
I should have been a great proficient.

877
01:02:41.195 --> 01:02:42.863
So would Anne,

878
01:02:42.947 --> 01:02:45.365
if her health would have allowed her.

879
01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:48.118
Lady Catherine, I'm not afflicted
with false modesty.

880
01:02:48.202 --> 01:02:49.661
When I say I play poorly...

881
01:02:49.745 --> 01:02:53.373
Come, come, Lizzie, Her Ladyship demands it.

882
01:03:02.592 --> 01:03:03.967
Thank you.

883
01:03:15.854 --> 01:03:18.314
How does Georgiana get along, Darcy?

884
01:03:19.107 --> 01:03:21.984
- She plays very well.
I hope she practices.

885
01:03:23.153 --> 01:03:26.113
No excellence can be acquired
without constant practise.

886
01:03:26.198 --> 01:03:28.365
I've told Mrs Collins this.

887
01:03:28.742 --> 01:03:30.409
Though you have no instrument of your own,

888
01:03:30.494 --> 01:03:32.286
you're very welcome to come to Rosings

889
01:03:32.370 --> 01:03:34.497
and play on the pianoforte
in the housekeeper's room.

890
01:03:34.581 --> 01:03:35.831
Oh, I thank you, Your Ladyship.

891
01:03:35.916 --> 01:03:39.209
You'll be in nobody's way
in that part of the house.

892
01:03:46.550 --> 01:03:48.343
You mean to frighten me, Mr Darcy,

893
01:03:48.427 --> 01:03:51.095
by coming in all your state to hear me,

894
01:03:51.972 --> 01:03:54.557
but I won't be alarmed even
if your sister does play so well.

895
01:03:54.642 --> 01:03:56.684
I'm well enough acquainted with you,
Miss Elizabeth,

896
01:03:56.769 --> 01:04:00.021
to know that I cannot alarm you
even should I wish it.

897
01:04:00.147 --> 01:04:02.899
What was my friend like in Hertfordshire?

898
01:04:04.610 --> 01:04:06.402
You really care to know?

899
01:04:07.488 --> 01:04:10.448
Prepare yourself for something very dreadful.

900
01:04:10.699 --> 01:04:12.450
The first time I saw him at the assembly,

901
01:04:12.535 --> 01:04:14.243
he danced with nobody at all.

902
01:04:14.327 --> 01:04:15.786
Even though gentlemen were scarce

903
01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:18.622
and there was more than one young
lady sitting down without a partner.

904
01:04:18.706 --> 01:04:20.374
I knew nobody beyond my own party.

905
01:04:20.458 --> 01:04:22.376
Oh, and nobody can be introduced in a ballroom.

906
01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:24.294
Fitzwilliam, I need you.

907
01:04:35.807 --> 01:04:38.350
I do not have the talent

908
01:04:38.810 --> 01:04:42.354
of conversing easily with people
I have never met before.

909
01:04:42.522 --> 01:04:46.024
Perhaps you should take
your aunt's advice and practise.

910
01:05:07.337 --> 01:05:10.381
Dear Jane...

911
01:05:22.269 --> 01:05:23.561
Mr Darcy.

912
01:05:31.402 --> 01:05:32.944
Please, do be seated.

913
01:05:38.868 --> 01:05:42.871
I'm afraid Mr and Mrs Collins have
gone on business to the village.

914
01:05:49.295 --> 01:05:51.046
This is a charming house.

915
01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:52.881
I believe my aunt did a great deal to it

916
01:05:52.965 --> 01:05:55.050
when Mr Collins first arrived.

917
01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:57.802
I believe so.

918
01:05:59.638 --> 01:06:02.931
She could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful subject.

919
01:06:13.234 --> 01:06:15.861
- Shall I call for some tea?
- No. Thank you.

920
01:06:20.617 --> 01:06:23.410
Good day, Miss Elizabeth.
It's been a pleasure.

921
01:06:30.001 --> 01:06:33.087
What on earth have you done to poor Mr Darcy?

922
01:06:33.546 --> 01:06:34.921
I have no idea.

923
01:06:37.132 --> 01:06:39.884
Every mind must have
some counsellor

924
01:06:39.968 --> 01:06:43.429
to whom it may apply
for consolation in distress.

925
01:06:43.931 --> 01:06:46.391
There are many conveniences
which others can supply

926
01:06:46.475 --> 01:06:48.685
and which we cannot procure for ourselves.

927
01:06:48.769 --> 01:06:51.062
I have now principally in view those objects

928
01:06:51.146 --> 01:06:53.940
which are only to be obtained
through intercourse.

929
01:06:56.276 --> 01:06:57.276
Forgive me.

930
01:06:57.361 --> 01:07:00.238
Through the intercourse
of friendship or civility.

931
01:07:01.907 --> 01:07:04.575
On such occasions, the proud man steps forth

932
01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:07.704
to meet you not with the cordiality
of affection,

933
01:07:07.788 --> 01:07:11.998
but with the suspicion of one
who reconnoitres an enemy...

934
01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:15.127
So, how long do you plan to stay
in Kent, Colonel?

935
01:07:15.211 --> 01:07:17.754
As long as Darcy chooses.
I'm at his disposal.

936
01:07:17.839 --> 01:07:19.840
Everyone appears to be at his disposal.

937
01:07:19.924 --> 01:07:23.552
I wonder he doesn't marry and secure
a lasting convenience of that kind.

938
01:07:23.636 --> 01:07:26.054
She would be a lucky woman.

939
01:07:26.639 --> 01:07:27.764
Really?

940
01:07:27.890 --> 01:07:30.517
Darcy is a most loyal companion.

941
01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:32.686
From what I heard on our journey here,

942
01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:35.397
he recently came to the rescue
of one of his friends just in time.

943
01:07:35.481 --> 01:07:36.648
What happened?

944
01:07:36.733 --> 01:07:38.567
He saved the man from an imprudent marriage.

945
01:07:38.651 --> 01:07:39.818
Who was the man?

946
01:07:45.532 --> 01:07:48.033
His closest friend, Charles Bingley.

947
01:07:51.496 --> 01:07:54.331
Did Mr Darcy give a reason
for this interference?

948
01:07:54.624 --> 01:07:57.668
There were apparently strong
objections to the lady.

949
01:07:58.128 --> 01:08:00.004
What kind of objections?

950
01:08:00.297 --> 01:08:01.505
Her lack of fortune?

951
01:08:01.590 --> 01:08:05.050
I think it was her family
that was considered unsuitable.

952
01:08:06.970 --> 01:08:08.637
So he separated them.

953
01:08:08.722 --> 01:08:11.015
I believe so. I know nothing else.

954
01:08:11.224 --> 01:08:13.768
...in need to every man
which is bound

955
01:08:13.852 --> 01:08:16.020
not to think of himself more highly...

956
01:08:42.213 --> 01:08:43.713
Miss Elizabeth.

957
01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:46.508
I have struggled in vain
and I can bear it no longer.

958
01:08:46.592 --> 01:08:48.593
These past months have been a torment.

959
01:08:48.677 --> 01:08:50.678
I came to Rosings with
the single object of seeing you.

960
01:08:50.763 --> 01:08:51.930
I had to see you.

961
01:08:52.014 --> 01:08:54.765
I have fought against my better
judgment, my family's expectation,

962
01:08:54.849 --> 01:08:56.975
the inferiority of your birth,
my rank and circumstance,

963
01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:59.353
all these things, and I'm willing
to put them aside and ask you

964
01:08:59.437 --> 01:09:00.479
to end my agony.

965
01:09:00.563 --> 01:09:02.731
- I don't understand.
- I love you.

966
01:09:06.069 --> 01:09:07.402
Most ardently.

967
01:09:11.115 --> 01:09:13.909
Please do me the honour of accepting my hand.

968
01:09:16.746 --> 01:09:20.666
Sir, I appreciate the struggle
you have been through

969
01:09:20.750 --> 01:09:23.460
and I am very sorry to have caused you pain.

970
01:09:23.545 --> 01:09:26.046
Believe me, it was unconsciously done.

971
01:09:27.006 --> 01:09:28.840
- Is this your reply?
- Yes, sir.

972
01:09:28.924 --> 01:09:31.259
Are you laughing at me?

973
01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:32.885
- No.
- Are you rejecting me?

974
01:09:32.970 --> 01:09:34.929
I'm sure that the feelings which,
as you've told me,

975
01:09:35.013 --> 01:09:37.765
have hindered your regard
will help you in overcoming it.

976
01:09:38.851 --> 01:09:39.851
Might I ask why,

977
01:09:39.935 --> 01:09:42.103
with so little endeavour at civility,
I am thus repulsed?

978
01:09:42.187 --> 01:09:43.604
And I might as well enquire why,

979
01:09:43.689 --> 01:09:45.356
with so evident a design of insulting me,

980
01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:46.649
you chose to tell me that you liked me

981
01:09:46.733 --> 01:09:48.192
- against your better judgement!
- No, believe me...

982
01:09:48.277 --> 01:09:50.069
If I was uncivil, then that is some excuse!

983
01:09:50.153 --> 01:09:51.737
But I have other reasons.
You know I have.

984
01:09:51.822 --> 01:09:53.030
What reasons?

985
01:09:53.115 --> 01:09:55.533
Do you think that anything might
tempt me to accept the man

986
01:09:55.617 --> 01:09:57.034
who has ruined, perhaps forever,

987
01:09:57.119 --> 01:09:59.453
the happiness of a most beloved sister?

988
01:10:00.455 --> 01:10:02.456
Do you deny it, Mr Darcy?

989
01:10:03.083 --> 01:10:05.458
That you separated a young couple
who loved each other,

990
01:10:05.543 --> 01:10:07.836
exposing your friend to the centre
of the world for caprice

991
01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:10.922
and my sister to its derision
for disappointed hopes.

992
01:10:11.007 --> 01:10:13.008
And involving them both in misery
of the acutest kind?

993
01:10:13.092 --> 01:10:14.759
I do not deny it.

994
01:10:15.595 --> 01:10:16.553
How could you do it?

995
01:10:16.637 --> 01:10:18.430
Because I believed your sister
indifferent to him.

996
01:10:18.514 --> 01:10:19.556
Indifferent?

997
01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:20.724
I watched them most carefully

998
01:10:20.808 --> 01:10:22.309
and realise his attachment was deeper than hers.

999
01:10:22.393 --> 01:10:23.393
That's because she's shy.

1000
01:10:23.477 --> 01:10:24.477
Bingley, too, is modest

1001
01:10:24.562 --> 01:10:26.104
and was persuaded
she didn't feel strongly for him.

1002
01:10:26.188 --> 01:10:28.231
- Because you suggested it.
- I did it for his own good.

1003
01:10:28.316 --> 01:10:31.359
My sister hardly shows her true feelings to me!

1004
01:10:35.823 --> 01:10:39.074
I suppose you suspect
that his fortune had some bearing...

1005
01:10:39.159 --> 01:10:40.659
No! I wouldn't do your sister
the dishonour!

1006
01:10:40.744 --> 01:10:43.287
- Though it was suggested...
- What was?

1007
01:10:43.455 --> 01:10:45.789
It was made perfectly clear
that an advantageous marriage...

1008
01:10:45.874 --> 01:10:48.751
- Did my sister give that impression?
- No! No!

1009
01:10:48.835 --> 01:10:49.877
No. There was, however,

1010
01:10:49.961 --> 01:10:51.086
I have to admit, the matter of your family.

1011
01:10:51.171 --> 01:10:52.212
Our want of connection?

1012
01:10:52.297 --> 01:10:54.089
Mr Bingley didn't seem to vex
himself about that.

1013
01:10:54.174 --> 01:10:55.424
- No, it was more than that.
- How, sir?

1014
01:10:55.508 --> 01:10:56.508
It was the lack of propriety

1015
01:10:56.593 --> 01:10:58.177
shown by your mother,
your three younger sisters,

1016
01:10:58.261 --> 01:10:59.803
even, on occasion, your father.

1017
01:11:03.850 --> 01:11:05.017
Forgive me.

1018
01:11:06.811 --> 01:11:09.521
You and your sister I must exclude from this.

1019
01:11:13.817 --> 01:11:15.777
And what about Mr Wickham?

1020
01:11:17.529 --> 01:11:18.613
Mr Wickham?

1021
01:11:18.697 --> 01:11:21.115
What excuse can you give
for your behaviour towards him?

1022
01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:23.117
You take an eager interest
in that gentleman's concerns.

1023
01:11:23.202 --> 01:11:24.285
He told me of his misfortunes.

1024
01:11:24.370 --> 01:11:26.621
Oh, yes, his misfortunes
have been very great indeed.

1025
01:11:26.705 --> 01:11:30.041
You ruin his chances,
and yet you treat him with sarcasm?

1026
01:11:30.125 --> 01:11:32.168
So this is your opinion of me.

1027
01:11:32.753 --> 01:11:34.087
Thank you for explaining so fully.

1028
01:11:34.171 --> 01:11:36.464
Perhaps these of fences might have
been overlooked had not your

1029
01:11:36.548 --> 01:11:37.924
- pride been hurt by my honesty...
- My pride?

1030
01:11:38.008 --> 01:11:40.301
...In admitting scruples
about our relationship.

1031
01:11:40.386 --> 01:11:41.636
Could you expect me to rejoice

1032
01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:43.888
in the inferiority of your circumstances?

1033
01:11:43.973 --> 01:11:46.599
And those are the words of a gentleman.

1034
01:11:46.684 --> 01:11:47.976
From the first moment I met you,

1035
01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:50.310
your arrogance and conceit, your selfish disdain

1036
01:11:50.395 --> 01:11:51.478
for the feelings of others

1037
01:11:51.562 --> 01:11:53.730
made me realise that you were
the last man in the world

1038
01:11:53.815 --> 01:11:56.400
I could ever be prevailed upon to marry.

1039
01:12:08.788 --> 01:12:12.499
Forgive me, madam, for taking up
so much of your time.

1040
01:14:17.579 --> 01:14:19.413
I came to leave you this.

1041
01:14:30.217 --> 01:14:33.886
I shall not renew the sentiments
which were so disgusting to you,

1042
01:14:34.054 --> 01:14:38.224
but if I may, I will address the two
of fences you have laid against me.

1043
01:14:45.356 --> 01:14:47.899
My father loved Mr Wickham as a son.

1044
01:14:48.568 --> 01:14:51.153
In consequence he left him a generous living.

1045
01:14:51.571 --> 01:14:53.196
But upon my father's death, Mr Wickham

1046
01:14:53.281 --> 01:14:56.408
announced he had no intention of taking orders.

1047
01:14:57.243 --> 01:14:59.953
He demanded the value of the living
which he was given

1048
01:15:00.037 --> 01:15:02.664
and which he gambled away within weeks.

1049
01:15:05.418 --> 01:15:08.670
He then wrote demanding more money,
which I refused,

1050
01:15:08.754 --> 01:15:11.423
after which he severed all acquaintance.

1051
01:15:12.049 --> 01:15:14.134
He came back to see us last summer,

1052
01:15:14.218 --> 01:15:16.803
at which point he declared
passionate love for my sister

1053
01:15:16.888 --> 01:15:19.722
whom he tried to persuade to elope with him.

1054
01:15:20.807 --> 01:15:23.184
She is to inherit £30,000.

1055
01:15:24.227 --> 01:15:25.519
When it was made clear

1056
01:15:25.604 --> 01:15:27.563
he would never receive a penny
of that inheritance,

1057
01:15:27.647 --> 01:15:29.273
he disappeared.

1058
01:15:30.150 --> 01:15:33.944
I will not attempt to convey
the depth of Georgiana's despair.

1059
01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:35.821
She was 15 years old.

1060
01:15:39.117 --> 01:15:42.870
As to the other matter,
that of your sister and Mr Bingley.

1061
01:15:42.954 --> 01:15:46.624
Though the motives which governed me
may to you appear insufficient,

1062
01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:49.084
they were in the service of a friend.

1063
01:15:50.545 --> 01:15:51.629
Lizzie?

1064
01:15:55.424 --> 01:15:57.133
Are you all right?

1065
01:15:58.469 --> 01:15:59.802
I hardly know.

1066
01:16:08.979 --> 01:16:12.065
Lizzie, how fortunate you have arrived.

1067
01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:15.777
Your aunt and uncle are here
to deliver Jane from London.

1068
01:16:15.945 --> 01:16:18.655
- How is Jane?
- She's in the drawing room.

1069
01:16:22.534 --> 01:16:24.661
I'm quite over him, Lizzie.

1070
01:16:24.828 --> 01:16:27.914
If he passed me in the street,
I'd hardly notice.

1071
01:16:28.039 --> 01:16:29.498
London is so diverting.

1072
01:16:30.166 --> 01:16:32.000
- Jane.
- It's true.

1073
01:16:33.795 --> 01:16:35.837
There's so much to entertain.

1074
01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:43.887
What news from Kent?

1075
01:16:46.349 --> 01:16:47.516
Nothing.

1076
01:16:49.852 --> 01:16:52.020
At least, not much to entertain.

1077
01:16:52.105 --> 01:16:54.731
Lizzie. Lizzie, tell Mama, tell her!

1078
01:16:54.816 --> 01:16:56.733
Oh, Kitty, stop making such a fuss.

1079
01:16:56.818 --> 01:16:59.820
- Why didn't she ask me as well?
She probably can't afford it.

1080
01:16:59.904 --> 01:17:01.905
- Because I'm better company.
- Kitty, what's the matter?

1081
01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:04.782
- I've just as much right as Lydia.
If I could but go to Brighton.

1082
01:17:04.866 --> 01:17:06.284
- Also because I am two years older.
- Let's all go.

1083
01:17:06.368 --> 01:17:08.703
Lydia's been invited to go
to Brighton with the Forsters.

1084
01:17:08.787 --> 01:17:11.289
A little sea-bathing would set me up
very nicely.

1085
01:17:11.373 --> 01:17:13.749
I shall dine with the officers every night.

1086
01:17:14.293 --> 01:17:16.085
Please, Papa, don't let her go.

1087
01:17:16.169 --> 01:17:19.046
Liddy will never be easy
until she's exposed herself

1088
01:17:19.131 --> 01:17:20.881
in some public place or other,

1089
01:17:20.966 --> 01:17:23.801
and we can never expect her to do it
with so little inconvenience

1090
01:17:23.885 --> 01:17:25.469
as under the present circumstances.

1091
01:17:25.554 --> 01:17:27.888
If you, dear father, do not take
the trouble to check her,

1092
01:17:27.973 --> 01:17:29.098
she will be fixed forever

1093
01:17:29.182 --> 01:17:30.683
as the silliest and most determined flirt

1094
01:17:30.767 --> 01:17:32.768
who ever made her family ridiculous.

1095
01:17:32.894 --> 01:17:34.979
And Kitty will follow, as she always does.

1096
01:17:35.063 --> 01:17:37.981
Lizzie, we shall have no peace until she goes.

1097
01:17:38.065 --> 01:17:41.735
Peace. Is that really
all you care about?

1098
01:17:43.738 --> 01:17:46.114
Colonel Forster is a sensible man.

1099
01:17:47.158 --> 01:17:49.701
He will keep her out of any real mischief.

1100
01:17:50.328 --> 01:17:53.163
And she is far too poor
to be an object of prey to anyone.

1101
01:17:53.247 --> 01:17:56.041
- Father, it's dangerous.
- I am certain

1102
01:17:56.292 --> 01:17:59.669
the officers will find women
better worth their while.

1103
01:18:00.254 --> 01:18:03.715
Let us hope, in fact, that her stay in Brighton

1104
01:18:04.675 --> 01:18:08.094
will teach her her own insignificance.

1105
01:18:09.263 --> 01:18:11.890
At any rate, she can hardly grow any worse.

1106
01:18:11.974 --> 01:18:13.432
If she does,

1107
01:18:13.516 --> 01:18:16.769
we'd be obliged to lock her up
for the rest of her life.

1108
01:18:25.945 --> 01:18:29.031
Lizzie dear, you'd be welcome to accompany us.

1109
01:18:29.324 --> 01:18:31.241
The Peak District is not Brighton

1110
01:18:31.326 --> 01:18:33.077
and officers are very thin on the ground,

1111
01:18:33.161 --> 01:18:34.870
which may influence your decision.

1112
01:18:34.954 --> 01:18:38.791
Come to the Peak District
with us, Lizzie, and get some fresh air.

1113
01:18:38.875 --> 01:18:40.459
The glories of nature.

1114
01:18:40.543 --> 01:18:42.628
What are men compared to rocks and mountains?

1115
01:18:42.712 --> 01:18:45.631
Believe me, men are either eaten up
with arrogance or stupidity.

1116
01:18:45.715 --> 01:18:47.466
If they are amiable, they're so easily led

1117
01:18:47.550 --> 01:18:49.258
they have no minds of their own whatsoever.

1118
01:18:49.343 --> 01:18:52.637
Oh, take care, my love,
that savers strongly of bitterness.

1119
01:18:59.645 --> 01:19:02.313
I saw Mr Darcy when I was at Rosings.

1120
01:19:04.066 --> 01:19:05.983
Why did you not tell me?

1121
01:19:08.362 --> 01:19:10.321
Did he mention Mr Bingley?

1122
01:19:12.991 --> 01:19:14.033
No.

1123
01:19:18.831 --> 01:19:20.415
No, he did not.

1124
01:20:24.895 --> 01:20:28.397
Oh, what are men compared
to rocks and mountains?

1125
01:20:28.482 --> 01:20:30.608
Or carriages that work.

1126
01:20:35.863 --> 01:20:37.489
Where exactly are we?

1127
01:20:38.741 --> 01:20:41.242
I think we're quite close to Pemberley.

1128
01:20:42.912 --> 01:20:45.580
- Mr Darcy's home?
- That's the fellow.

1129
01:20:45.915 --> 01:20:49.167
Very well stocked lake.
I've a hankering to see it.

1130
01:20:49.251 --> 01:20:50.919
Oh, no, let's not.

1131
01:20:54.006 --> 01:20:55.215
Oh, he's so...

1132
01:20:56.425 --> 01:20:59.385
I'd rather not, he's so...
He's so...

1133
01:21:00.179 --> 01:21:01.763
So what?
- He's so rich.

1134
01:21:02.681 --> 01:21:05.016
By heavens, Lizzie, what a snob you are.

1135
01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:07.601
Objecting to poor Mr Darcy
because of his wealth.

1136
01:21:07.685 --> 01:21:09.061
The poor man can't help it.

1137
01:21:09.145 --> 01:21:12.940
He won't be there anyway.
These great men are never at home.

1138
01:21:54.481 --> 01:21:55.815
My goodness.

1139
01:22:19.589 --> 01:22:20.714
Keep up.

1140
01:22:40.901 --> 01:22:42.736
Is your master
much at Pemberley?

1141
01:22:42.820 --> 01:22:46.573
Not as much as
I would wish, sir, for he dearly loves it here.

1142
01:22:47.199 --> 01:22:50.201
If he should marry,
you might see more of him.

1143
01:22:50.453 --> 01:22:53.662
Yes, madam,
but I do not know when that will be.

1144
01:22:59.878 --> 01:23:02.212
He's a lot like his father.

1145
01:23:02.297 --> 01:23:04.632
And most generous.

1146
01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:11.555
When my husband was ill,
Mr Darcy couldn't do enough.

1147
01:23:14.559 --> 01:23:16.143
He didn't fuss.

1148
01:23:16.227 --> 01:23:18.520
He just organise the servants for me.

1149
01:23:34.828 --> 01:23:37.664
This is he, Mr Darcy.

1150
01:23:39.708 --> 01:23:41.417
A handsome face.

1151
01:23:42.795 --> 01:23:46.172
Lizzie, is it a true likeness?

1152
01:23:46.423 --> 01:23:48.925
Does the young lady know Mr Darcy?

1153
01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:51.761
Only a little.

1154
01:23:52.638 --> 01:23:55.431
Do you not think him a handsome man, miss?

1155
01:23:56.767 --> 01:23:57.809
Yes.

1156
01:24:00.771 --> 01:24:02.646
Yes, I daresay he is.

1157
01:24:06.484 --> 01:24:09.277
This is his sister, Miss Georgiana.

1158
01:24:15.576 --> 01:24:16.993
Is she at home?

1159
01:26:24.034 --> 01:26:25.493
Miss Elizabeth!

1160
01:26:36.713 --> 01:26:38.381
I thought you were in London.

1161
01:26:39.007 --> 01:26:40.007
No.

1162
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:42.844
No, I'm not.

1163
01:26:43.929 --> 01:26:44.929
No.

1164
01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:47.014
- No, I came back a day early.
- We would not have come

1165
01:26:47.099 --> 01:26:49.141
- had we known you were here.
- Some business with my steward.

1166
01:26:54.773 --> 01:26:56.524
I'm in Derbyshire with my aunt and uncle.

1167
01:26:59.151 --> 01:27:01.361
And are you having a pleasant trip?

1168
01:27:01.445 --> 01:27:02.904
Very pleasant.

1169
01:27:04.115 --> 01:27:05.782
- Tomorrow we go to Matlock.
- Tomorrow?

1170
01:27:09.495 --> 01:27:12.664
- Are you staying at Lambton?
- Yes. At the Rose and Crown.

1171
01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:13.832
Yes.

1172
01:27:18.963 --> 01:27:20.755
I'm so sorry to intrude.

1173
01:27:20.882 --> 01:27:24.759
They said that the house was
open for visitors. I had no idea...

1174
01:27:28.347 --> 01:27:30.807
- May I see you back to the village?
- No!

1175
01:27:34.519 --> 01:27:36.562
- I'm very fond of walking.
- Yes.

1176
01:27:39.232 --> 01:27:40.566
Yes, I know.

1177
01:27:45.322 --> 01:27:46.989
Goodbye, Mr Darcy.

1178
01:28:06.217 --> 01:28:07.634
This way, sir.

1179
01:28:14.683 --> 01:28:17.143
Are you sure you wouldn't like to join us?

1180
01:28:20.814 --> 01:28:24.233
- Thank you again, sir. Goodbye.
- Goodbye. Goodbye.

1181
01:28:29.615 --> 01:28:31.783
Lizzie, we've just met Mr Darcy.

1182
01:28:31.867 --> 01:28:33.785
You didn't tell us that you'd seen him?

1183
01:28:33.869 --> 01:28:36.120
He's asked us to dine with him tomorrow.

1184
01:28:36.205 --> 01:28:37.956
He was very civil, was he not?

1185
01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:38.998
Very civil.

1186
01:28:39.083 --> 01:28:40.708
Not at all
how you had painted him.

1187
01:28:40.793 --> 01:28:41.959
To dine with him?

1188
01:28:42.043 --> 01:28:45.754
There's something pleasant
about his mouth when he speaks.

1189
01:28:46.714 --> 01:28:49.675
You don't mind delaying our journey
another day, do you?

1190
01:28:49.759 --> 01:28:52.719
He particularly wants you
to meet his sister.

1191
01:28:53.471 --> 01:28:54.846
His sister?

1192
01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:25.167
Miss Elizabeth!

1193
01:29:30.549 --> 01:29:32.675
My sister, Miss Georgiana.

1194
01:29:32.759 --> 01:29:35.011
My brother has told me so much about you.

1195
01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:37.346
I feel as if we are friends already.

1196
01:29:37.431 --> 01:29:40.850
Well, thank you.
What a beautiful pianoforte.

1197
01:29:40.934 --> 01:29:42.852
My brother gave it to me.
He shouldn't have.

1198
01:29:42.936 --> 01:29:45.438
- Yes, I should've.
- Oh, very well then.

1199
01:29:45.522 --> 01:29:47.398
Easily persuaded, is she not?

1200
01:29:48.191 --> 01:29:50.526
Your unfortunate brother once had
to put up with my playing

1201
01:29:50.610 --> 01:29:51.652
for a whole evening.

1202
01:29:51.737 --> 01:29:53.778
But he says you play so well.

1203
01:29:53.863 --> 01:29:55.989
Then he has perjured himself most profoundly.

1204
01:29:56.073 --> 01:29:57.699
No, I said, "played quite well."

1205
01:29:57.783 --> 01:30:00.785
Oh, "quite well" is not "very well."
I'm satisfied.

1206
01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:08.793
Mr Gardiner,

1207
01:30:09.128 --> 01:30:11.004
- are you fond of fishing?
- Oh, very much, sir.

1208
01:30:11.088 --> 01:30:13.423
Can I persuade you to accompany me
to the lake this afternoon?

1209
01:30:13.507 --> 01:30:15.050
It's very well stocked and its occupants

1210
01:30:15.134 --> 01:30:16.509
left in peace for far too long.

1211
01:30:16.594 --> 01:30:18.136
I would be delighted.

1212
01:30:18.471 --> 01:30:20.555
Do you play duets, Miss Elizabeth?

1213
01:30:20.639 --> 01:30:22.057
Only when forced.

1214
01:30:22.308 --> 01:30:24.434
Brother, you must force her.

1215
01:30:26.145 --> 01:30:29.730
Splendid fishing, good company.
What a capital fellow.

1216
01:30:29.939 --> 01:30:32.066
Thank you so much, Mr Darcy.

1217
01:30:34.819 --> 01:30:36.737
A letter for you, madam.

1218
01:30:37.238 --> 01:30:38.697
Oh, it's from Jane.

1219
01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:05.723
It's the most dreadful news.

1220
01:31:08.477 --> 01:31:11.187
Lydia has run away

1221
01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:15.024
with Mr Wickham.

1222
01:31:15.109 --> 01:31:17.360
They are gone from Brighton to Lord knows where.

1223
01:31:17.444 --> 01:31:20.363
She has no money, no connections.

1224
01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:23.491
I fear she is lost forever.

1225
01:31:27.121 --> 01:31:28.412
This is my fault.

1226
01:31:28.914 --> 01:31:30.873
If only I had exposed Wickham when I should.

1227
01:31:30.958 --> 01:31:31.958
No.

1228
01:31:32.793 --> 01:31:34.544
No, this is my fault.

1229
01:31:35.838 --> 01:31:37.045
I might have prevented all this

1230
01:31:37.130 --> 01:31:39.548
merely by being open with my sisters.

1231
01:31:40.174 --> 01:31:42.676
Has anything been done
to recover her?

1232
01:31:43.219 --> 01:31:45.345
My father has gone to London.

1233
01:31:45.888 --> 01:31:48.598
But I know very well that nothing can be done.

1234
01:31:50.434 --> 01:31:52.394
We have not the smallest hope.

1235
01:31:53.354 --> 01:31:55.105
Would I could help you.

1236
01:31:55.731 --> 01:31:57.607
Sir, I think it is too late.

1237
01:32:01.487 --> 01:32:03.196
This is grave indeed.

1238
01:32:03.489 --> 01:32:05.448
I will leave you. Goodbye.

1239
01:32:05.658 --> 01:32:07.701
I'm afraid we must go at once.

1240
01:32:07.785 --> 01:32:09.452
I will join Mr Bennet and find Lydia

1241
01:32:09.537 --> 01:32:11.496
before she ruins the family forever.

1242
01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:42.610
Oh, why did the Forsters
let her out of their sight?

1243
01:32:44.196 --> 01:32:47.488
I always said they were unfit
to take charge of her.

1244
01:32:47.615 --> 01:32:50.116
- And now she's ruined.
- You are all ruined.

1245
01:32:50.868 --> 01:32:54.454
Who will take you now
with a fallen sister?

1246
01:32:56.790 --> 01:33:00.460
Poor Mr Bennet will now have
to fight the perfidious Wickham

1247
01:33:00.544 --> 01:33:01.711
and then be killed.

1248
01:33:01.795 --> 01:33:03.213
He hasn't found him yet, Mama.

1249
01:33:03.297 --> 01:33:06.925
And then Mr Collins will turn us
out before he's cold in his grave.

1250
01:33:07.009 --> 01:33:08.509
Do not be so alarmed, Mama.

1251
01:33:08.594 --> 01:33:11.054
Our uncle has gone on to London
and is helping in the search.

1252
01:33:11.138 --> 01:33:14.557
Lydia must know what this must be
doing to my nerves.

1253
01:33:16.810 --> 01:33:21.022
Such flutterings and spasms all over me.

1254
01:33:23.650 --> 01:33:25.859
My baby Lydia.

1255
01:33:25.944 --> 01:33:27.152
My baby.

1256
01:33:27.487 --> 01:33:31.156
How could she do such a thing to her poor mama?

1257
01:33:33.368 --> 01:33:35.827
- You can't do that.
- Don't be such a baby.

1258
01:33:35.995 --> 01:33:37.162
Kitty, give it to me.

1259
01:33:37.247 --> 01:33:38.538
- No!
- Who is it for?

1260
01:33:38.623 --> 01:33:40.374
It's addressed to Papa.

1261
01:33:42.168 --> 01:33:43.919
It's in Uncle's writing.

1262
01:33:44.462 --> 01:33:46.255
Papa, there's a letter!

1263
01:33:46.965 --> 01:33:49.925
- Let me catch my breath.
- It's in Uncle's writing.

1264
01:33:54.847 --> 01:33:57.265
- He has found them.
- Are they married?

1265
01:33:57.349 --> 01:33:59.934
- Wait. I can't make out his script.
- Oh, give it to me!

1266
01:34:00.018 --> 01:34:01.352
Are they married?

1267
01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:04.105
They will be, if father will settle
£100 a year on her.

1268
01:34:04.189 --> 01:34:05.940
- That is Wickham's condition.
- £100?

1269
01:34:06.024 --> 01:34:09.068
- You will agree to this, Father?
- Of course I'll agree.

1270
01:34:09.152 --> 01:34:13.614
God knows how much your uncle
must have laid on that wretched man.

1271
01:34:13.824 --> 01:34:15.157
What do you mean, Father?

1272
01:34:15.242 --> 01:34:17.243
No man in his senses would marry Lydia

1273
01:34:17.327 --> 01:34:20.037
under so slight a temptation as £100 a year.

1274
01:34:21.623 --> 01:34:24.166
Your uncle must have been very generous.

1275
01:34:25.002 --> 01:34:26.961
Do you think it a large sum?

1276
01:34:27.546 --> 01:34:29.880
Wickham's a fool if he accepts
less than £10,000.

1277
01:34:29.965 --> 01:34:32.882
- £10,000? Heaven forbid.
- Father!

1278
01:34:35.886 --> 01:34:37.012
Lydia married.

1279
01:34:38.139 --> 01:34:40.348
And at 15, too.

1280
01:34:40.599 --> 01:34:42.183
Ring the bell, Kitty.

1281
01:34:42.268 --> 01:34:44.811
I must put on my things and tell Lady Lucas.

1282
01:34:44.895 --> 01:34:46.646
Oh, to see her face.

1283
01:34:46.939 --> 01:34:49.816
And tell the servants
they will have a bowl of punch.

1284
01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:51.276
We should thank our uncle, Mama.

1285
01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:52.736
And so he should help.

1286
01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:55.322
He's far richer than us and has no children.

1287
01:34:55.406 --> 01:34:56.781
A daughter, married!

1288
01:34:56.866 --> 01:34:58.700
Is that really
all you think about?

1289
01:34:58.784 --> 01:35:00.410
When you have five daughters, Lizzie,

1290
01:35:00.494 --> 01:35:02.454
tell me what else will occupy your thoughts,

1291
01:35:02.538 --> 01:35:04.414
and then perhaps you will understand.

1292
01:35:06.292 --> 01:35:07.916
You don't know what he's like.

1293
01:35:09.586 --> 01:35:11.462
Lydia!
- Mama.

1294
01:35:16.176 --> 01:35:18.677
We passed Sarah Sims in her carriage.

1295
01:35:18.762 --> 01:35:20.929
So I took off my glove and let my hand just rest

1296
01:35:21.014 --> 01:35:22.431
so she might see the ring.

1297
01:35:22.515 --> 01:35:25.100
Then I bowed and smiled like anything.

1298
01:35:25.185 --> 01:35:26.185
Sarah Sims.

1299
01:35:26.269 --> 01:35:29.355
I'm sure she was not half as radiant
as you, my dear.

1300
01:35:29.439 --> 01:35:30.481
Oh, Mama!

1301
01:35:30.565 --> 01:35:32.649
You must all go to Brighton,

1302
01:35:32.734 --> 01:35:34.818
for that is the place to get husbands.

1303
01:35:35.028 --> 01:35:37.780
- I hope you have half my good luck.
- Lydia.

1304
01:35:38.114 --> 01:35:41.200
I want to hear every little detail, Lydia dear.

1305
01:35:41.283 --> 01:35:43.117
- Oh, Mama!
- Beautiful.

1306
01:35:43.202 --> 01:35:45.536
I've been enlisted in a regiment
in the North of England, sir.

1307
01:35:45.621 --> 01:35:47.205
Glad to hear it.

1308
01:35:47.581 --> 01:35:50.541
Near Newcastle.
We travel there next week.

1309
01:35:51.085 --> 01:35:53.961
- Can I come and stay with you?
- That is out of the question.

1310
01:35:55.798 --> 01:35:58.091
Well, Monday morning came
and I was in such a fuss.

1311
01:35:58.175 --> 01:35:59.175
I don't want to hear.

1312
01:35:59.259 --> 01:36:01.052
There was my aunt, preaching and talking away

1313
01:36:01.136 --> 01:36:03.221
as if she was reading a sermon.

1314
01:36:03.305 --> 01:36:06.432
- She was horrid unpleasant.
- Can't you understand why?

1315
01:36:07.184 --> 01:36:11.312
But I didn't hear a word because
I was thinking of my dear Wickham.

1316
01:36:11.522 --> 01:36:14.440
I longed to know whether
he'd be married in his blue coat.

1317
01:36:14.525 --> 01:36:17.150
The North of England, I believe,
boasts some spectacular scenery.

1318
01:36:17.235 --> 01:36:19.653
And then my uncle was called away
from the church on business,

1319
01:36:19.737 --> 01:36:23.073
and I thought, "Who is to be our
best man if he doesn't come back?"

1320
01:36:23.157 --> 01:36:25.909
Lucky he did come back or
I would have had to ask Mr Darcy,

1321
01:36:25.993 --> 01:36:27.244
but I don't really like him.

1322
01:36:27.328 --> 01:36:28.495
Mr Darcy?

1323
01:36:28.579 --> 01:36:33.166
Oh, I forgot.
But I shouldn't have said a word.

1324
01:36:33.835 --> 01:36:35.627
Mr Darcy was at your wedding?

1325
01:36:35.711 --> 01:36:38.171
He was the one that discovered us.

1326
01:36:38.673 --> 01:36:42.717
He paid for the wedding,
Wickham's commission. Everything.

1327
01:36:43.136 --> 01:36:45.846
But don't tell anyone.
He told me not to tell.

1328
01:36:46.264 --> 01:36:48.390
- Mr Darcy?
- Stop it, Lizzie.

1329
01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:53.269
Mr Darcy's not half as high
and mighty as you sometimes.

1330
01:36:53.353 --> 01:36:55.354
Tell Kitty to stop glaring
at Mr Wickham,

1331
01:36:55.439 --> 01:36:57.773
your father's doing enough for the pair of them.

1332
01:36:59.693 --> 01:37:02.111
Kitty, have you seen my ring?

1333
01:37:02.821 --> 01:37:04.989
Write to me often, my dear.

1334
01:37:05.198 --> 01:37:07.700
Married women never have much time for writing.

1335
01:37:07.784 --> 01:37:09.201
No, I dare say you won't.

1336
01:37:10.412 --> 01:37:11.620
When I married your father

1337
01:37:11.705 --> 01:37:14.039
there didn't seem to be enough hours in the day!

1338
01:37:17.043 --> 01:37:21.130
Well, my sisters may write to me.
For they'll have nothing else to do.

1339
01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:32.182
There's nothing so bad
as parting with one's children.

1340
01:37:34.268 --> 01:37:36.603
One seems so forlorn without them.

1341
01:37:42.401 --> 01:37:43.526
Goodbye.

1342
01:37:43.986 --> 01:37:47.405
Goodbye, Lydia.
Goodbye, Mr Wickham.

1343
01:37:49.283 --> 01:37:51.618
Bye, Kitty. Bye, Papa.

1344
01:37:57.666 --> 01:38:01.002
I can't imagine
what your father does with all that ink.

1345
01:38:01.085 --> 01:38:02.461
Mrs Bennet.

1346
01:38:03.963 --> 01:38:05.631
Did you hear the news, madam?

1347
01:38:05.715 --> 01:38:07.424
Mr Bingley is returning to Netherfield.

1348
01:38:07.509 --> 01:38:08.675
Mr Bingley?

1349
01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:11.595
Mrs Nichols is ordering a haunch of pork.

1350
01:38:11.679 --> 01:38:13.263
She expects him tomorrow.

1351
01:38:13.348 --> 01:38:14.556
Tomorrow?

1352
01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:19.019
Not that I care about him.
Mr Bingley's nothing to us.

1353
01:38:19.103 --> 01:38:21.855
I'm sure I never want
to see him again. No.

1354
01:38:21.940 --> 01:38:26.318
We shan't mention a word about it.
Is it quite certain he's coming?

1355
01:38:26.778 --> 01:38:30.781
Yes, madam. I believe he is alone.
His sister remains in town.

1356
01:38:31.449 --> 01:38:32.449
So.

1357
01:38:33.743 --> 01:38:36.494
Why he thinks we should be
interested, I've no idea.

1358
01:38:36.578 --> 01:38:37.954
Come along, girls.

1359
01:38:39.665 --> 01:38:41.624
Let's go home at once, Mary,

1360
01:38:42.251 --> 01:38:45.002
and tell Mr Bennet the impudence of the man.

1361
01:38:45.087 --> 01:38:47.088
I wonder he dare show his face.

1362
01:38:48.131 --> 01:38:50.216
It's all right, Lizzie. I'm...

1363
01:38:50.467 --> 01:38:51.842
I'm just glad he comes alone

1364
01:38:51.927 --> 01:38:53.344
because then we shall see less of him.

1365
01:38:53.428 --> 01:38:57.848
Not that I'm afraid of myself.
But I dread other people's remarks.

1366
01:38:57.933 --> 01:38:59.100
Oh, I'm sorry.

1367
01:39:33.968 --> 01:39:36.136
He's here! He's here.
He's at the door!

1368
01:39:37.346 --> 01:39:38.430
Mr Bingley!

1369
01:39:38.514 --> 01:39:41.558
Mr Bingley? Oh, my goodness!

1370
01:39:41.642 --> 01:39:43.560
Everybody behave naturally.

1371
01:39:43.644 --> 01:39:46.270
And whatever you do, do not appear overbearing.

1372
01:39:46.354 --> 01:39:48.355
Look, there's someone with him.
Mama. Mama.

1373
01:39:48.481 --> 01:39:50.608
Mr What's-his-name.
The pompous one from before.

1374
01:39:50.692 --> 01:39:51.942
Mr Darcy!

1375
01:39:52.027 --> 01:39:54.778
The very insolence of it.
What does he think of, coming here?

1376
01:39:54.863 --> 01:39:56.322
Keep still, Jane.

1377
01:39:56.406 --> 01:39:59.617
Mary, put that away at once.
Find some useful employment.

1378
01:40:01.328 --> 01:40:04.997
Oh, my Lord! I shall have a seizure,
I'm sure I shall.

1379
01:40:05.081 --> 01:40:06.123
Kitty!

1380
01:40:07.876 --> 01:40:09.376
- Kitty!
- We can't have this here.

1381
01:40:09.502 --> 01:40:12.046
Mary, the ribbons, the ribbons, the ribbons.

1382
01:40:13.381 --> 01:40:16.717
Mary, sit down at once. Mary!

1383
01:40:21.722 --> 01:40:24.974
Mr Darcy
and Mr Bingley, ma'am.

1384
01:40:36.820 --> 01:40:37.945
Good...

1385
01:40:38.030 --> 01:40:39.656
How very glad we are
to see you, Mr Bingley.

1386
01:40:39.740 --> 01:40:42.659
There've been a great many changes
since you went away.

1387
01:40:42.743 --> 01:40:46.037
Miss Lucas is married and settled.

1388
01:40:46.246 --> 01:40:48.247
And one of my own daughters, too.

1389
01:40:48.415 --> 01:40:49.999
You will have seen it in the papers,

1390
01:40:50.084 --> 01:40:52.627
though it was not put in
as it ought to have been.

1391
01:40:52.711 --> 01:40:56.463
Very short, nothing about her family.

1392
01:40:56.547 --> 01:40:59.257
Yes. Yes, I did hear of it.
I offer my congratulations.

1393
01:40:59.384 --> 01:41:02.928
But it is very hard to have
my Lydia taken away from me.

1394
01:41:03.137 --> 01:41:07.099
Mr Wickham has been transferred
to Newcastle, wherever that is.

1395
01:41:07.225 --> 01:41:09.351
Do you hope to stay long
in the country, Mr Bingley?

1396
01:41:09.435 --> 01:41:11.687
Just a few weeks. For the shooting.

1397
01:41:11.771 --> 01:41:13.939
When you have killed all your
own birds, Mr Bingley,

1398
01:41:14.023 --> 01:41:16.525
I beg you will come here
and shoot as many as you please.

1399
01:41:16.609 --> 01:41:17.609
Thank you.

1400
01:41:17.694 --> 01:41:19.986
Mr Bennet will be vastly happy to oblige you

1401
01:41:20.071 --> 01:41:21.905
and will save all the best
of the coveys for you.

1402
01:41:21.989 --> 01:41:23.198
Excellent.

1403
01:41:24.367 --> 01:41:26.076
Are you well, Mr Darcy?

1404
01:41:26.577 --> 01:41:28.245
Quite well, thank you.

1405
01:41:28.871 --> 01:41:31.080
I hope that the weather stays fine
for your sport.

1406
01:41:31.164 --> 01:41:32.832
I return to town tomorrow.

1407
01:41:33.625 --> 01:41:34.875
So soon?

1408
01:41:36.378 --> 01:41:38.003
My Jane looks well,

1409
01:41:38.630 --> 01:41:40.089
does she not?

1410
01:41:42.801 --> 01:41:44.135
She does indeed.

1411
01:41:52.394 --> 01:41:54.645
Well, we must be going, I think.

1412
01:41:55.856 --> 01:41:56.856
Darcy.

1413
01:41:57.441 --> 01:42:00.860
It's been very pleasant to see
you all again. Miss Elizabeth.

1414
01:42:01.445 --> 01:42:03.279
- Miss Bennet.
You must come again.

1415
01:42:03.363 --> 01:42:05.072
For when you were in town last winter,

1416
01:42:05.157 --> 01:42:07.198
you promised to have a family dinner with us.

1417
01:42:07.283 --> 01:42:10.952
I've not forgot, you see.
At least three courses.

1418
01:42:17.668 --> 01:42:18.668
Excuse me.

1419
01:42:24.967 --> 01:42:27.469
Most extraordinary.

1420
01:42:38.939 --> 01:42:41.899
We were going to walk in,
and she was going to say, "Sit down."

1421
01:42:42.025 --> 01:42:43.108
- No, no.
- No.

1422
01:42:43.193 --> 01:42:45.360
So, I feel...

1423
01:42:55.246 --> 01:42:57.164
Oh, it's a disaster, isn't it?

1424
01:42:57.499 --> 01:42:59.500
It's been, it's...

1425
01:43:01.711 --> 01:43:04.004
- Miss Bennet.
- Mr Bingley.

1426
01:43:04.214 --> 01:43:06.632
I just go in and I'll just say it.

1427
01:43:06.716 --> 01:43:09.134
- Just say it.
- Yes. Exactly, exactly.

1428
01:43:11.429 --> 01:43:13.013
Oh, God.

1429
01:43:14.057 --> 01:43:15.432
I'm glad that's over.

1430
01:43:15.517 --> 01:43:18.059
At least now we can meet
as indifferent acquaintances.

1431
01:43:18.143 --> 01:43:19.143
Oh, yes.

1432
01:43:19.228 --> 01:43:22.271
No, you cannot think me so weak
as to be in danger now.

1433
01:43:22.564 --> 01:43:24.732
I think you are in great danger of making him

1434
01:43:24.817 --> 01:43:27.068
as much in love with you as ever.

1435
01:43:27.778 --> 01:43:31.113
I'm sorry, though, that he came with Mr Darcy.

1436
01:43:31.532 --> 01:43:32.782
Don't say that.

1437
01:43:33.575 --> 01:43:34.826
Why ever not?

1438
01:43:37.871 --> 01:43:39.038
Jane,

1439
01:43:40.833 --> 01:43:42.583
I've been so blind.

1440
01:43:44.586 --> 01:43:46.045
What do you mean?

1441
01:43:46.255 --> 01:43:49.006
Look, it's him! He's back.
He's come again.

1442
01:43:57.139 --> 01:43:59.266
I know this all very untoward,

1443
01:43:59.392 --> 01:44:00.851
but I would like to request the privilege

1444
01:44:00.935 --> 01:44:02.686
of speaking to Miss Bennet.

1445
01:44:04.689 --> 01:44:05.939
Alone.

1446
01:44:07.984 --> 01:44:11.778
Everybody to the kitchen. Immediately.

1447
01:44:11.863 --> 01:44:14.781
Except you, Jane dear. Of course.

1448
01:44:17.827 --> 01:44:22.247
Oh, Mr Bingley. It is so good
to see you again so soon.

1449
01:44:43.143 --> 01:44:45.895
First, I must tell you I have been

1450
01:44:45.979 --> 01:44:48.480
the most unmitigated and comprehensive ass.

1451
01:45:06.415 --> 01:45:08.249
Kitty, quiet.

1452
01:45:20.179 --> 01:45:21.179
Yes.

1453
01:45:22.765 --> 01:45:25.183
A thousand times, yes.

1454
01:45:30.564 --> 01:45:33.983
Thank the Lord for that.
I thought it would never happen.

1455
01:46:20.070 --> 01:46:23.114
I am confident they will do well together.

1456
01:46:24.741 --> 01:46:26.993
Their tempers are much alike.

1457
01:46:29.871 --> 01:46:33.624
Though they will be cheated
assiduously by their servants

1458
01:46:34.084 --> 01:46:36.794
and be so generous with the rest,

1459
01:46:37.337 --> 01:46:39.839
they will always exceed their income.

1460
01:46:40.340 --> 01:46:44.635
Exceed their income?
He has £5,000 a year.

1461
01:46:49.015 --> 01:46:52.392
I knew she could not
be so beautiful for nothing.

1462
01:47:01.110 --> 01:47:03.069
"... must be free
from all insincerity.

1463
01:47:03.154 --> 01:47:05.947
"She only can address herself
effectually to the heart

1464
01:47:06.073 --> 01:47:07.198
"and the feelings of others,

1465
01:47:07.283 --> 01:47:10.618
"whose mind glows
with the warmth of sensibility,

1466
01:47:10.703 --> 01:47:13.455
"and whose arguments result from conviction.

1467
01:47:13.622 --> 01:47:17.208
"She must feel the influence
of those passions and emotions

1468
01:47:17.293 --> 01:47:19.127
"which she wishes to inspire.

1469
01:47:19.253 --> 01:47:21.170
"An assumed..."

1470
01:47:41.483 --> 01:47:43.692
Can you die of happiness?

1471
01:47:44.944 --> 01:47:46.779
Do you know, he was totally ignorant

1472
01:47:46.863 --> 01:47:48.197
of my being in town in the spring.

1473
01:47:48.281 --> 01:47:51.241
- How did he account for it?
- He thought me indifferent.

1474
01:47:51.326 --> 01:47:52.493
Unfathomable.

1475
01:47:52.619 --> 01:47:55.453
No doubt poisoned by his pernicious sister.

1476
01:47:55.537 --> 01:47:56.662
Bravo.

1477
01:47:57.247 --> 01:48:00.833
I think that's the most unforgiving
speech you've ever made.

1478
01:48:01.668 --> 01:48:03.836
Oh, Lizzie, if I could but see you so happy.

1479
01:48:03.921 --> 01:48:06.172
If there were such another man for you.

1480
01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:11.594
Perhaps Mr Collins has a cousin.

1481
01:48:15.682 --> 01:48:17.391
- What is that?
What?

1482
01:48:18.519 --> 01:48:19.977
Maybe he's changed his mind.

1483
01:48:23.190 --> 01:48:24.398
Coming!

1484
01:48:28.487 --> 01:48:29.529
Yes?

1485
01:48:31.656 --> 01:48:33.031
Lady Catherine.

1486
01:48:39.539 --> 01:48:41.748
The rest of your offspring, I presume.

1487
01:48:42.667 --> 01:48:46.336
All but one, the youngest has been
lately married, Your Ladyship.

1488
01:48:46.546 --> 01:48:49.631
And my eldest was proposed to,
only this afternoon.

1489
01:48:51.384 --> 01:48:53.552
You have a very small garden, madam.

1490
01:48:53.636 --> 01:48:55.846
Could I offer you a cup of tea, perhaps, Your...

1491
01:48:55.930 --> 01:48:59.224
Absolutely not. I need to speak to
Miss Elizabeth Bennet alone.

1492
01:48:59.725 --> 01:49:01.434
As a matter of urgency.

1493
01:49:06.022 --> 01:49:09.650
You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet,
to understand why I am here.

1494
01:49:09.734 --> 01:49:12.153
Indeed you're mistaken. I cannot
account for this honour at all.

1495
01:49:12.237 --> 01:49:15.447
Miss Bennet, I warn you,
I am not to be trifled with.

1496
01:49:16.324 --> 01:49:18.951
A report of a most alarming nature
has reached me

1497
01:49:19.035 --> 01:49:22.746
that you intend to be united
with my nephew, Mr Darcy.

1498
01:49:23.748 --> 01:49:26.292
I know this to be a scandalous falsehood,

1499
01:49:26.376 --> 01:49:28.669
though not wishing to injure him
by supposing it possible,

1500
01:49:28.753 --> 01:49:31.172
I instantly set off to make my sentiments known.

1501
01:49:31.256 --> 01:49:32.673
If you believed it to be impossible,

1502
01:49:32.757 --> 01:49:34.675
I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far.

1503
01:49:34.759 --> 01:49:36.177
To hear it contradicted, Miss Bennet.

1504
01:49:36.261 --> 01:49:38.596
Your coming will be rather
a confirmation, surely,

1505
01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:40.972
- if indeed such a report exists.
- If?

1506
01:49:41.557 --> 01:49:44.058
Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?

1507
01:49:44.143 --> 01:49:46.561
Has it not been industriously
circulated by yourself?

1508
01:49:46.645 --> 01:49:48.563
I have never heard of it.

1509
01:49:48.856 --> 01:49:51.608
And can you declare
there is no foundation for it?

1510
01:49:51.692 --> 01:49:55.028
I do not pretend to possess
equal frankness with Your Ladyship.

1511
01:49:55.112 --> 01:49:57.322
You may ask a question
which I may choose not to answer.

1512
01:49:57.406 --> 01:49:58.406
This is not to be borne.

1513
01:49:58.490 --> 01:50:00.408
Has my nephew made you an offer of marriage?

1514
01:50:00.492 --> 01:50:02.410
Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible.

1515
01:50:02.494 --> 01:50:03.870
Let me be understood.

1516
01:50:03.954 --> 01:50:06.164
Mr Darcy is engaged to my daughter.

1517
01:50:06.582 --> 01:50:08.917
- Now, what have you to say?
- Only this. If that is the case,

1518
01:50:09.001 --> 01:50:11.419
you can have no reason to suppose
he would make an offer to me.

1519
01:50:11.503 --> 01:50:13.046
You selfish girl!

1520
01:50:13.589 --> 01:50:16.298
This union has been planned since their infancy.

1521
01:50:16.841 --> 01:50:20.219
Do you think it can be prevented by
a young woman of inferior birth

1522
01:50:20.303 --> 01:50:22.054
whose own sister's elopement

1523
01:50:22.138 --> 01:50:25.057
resulted in a scandalously
patched-up marriage

1524
01:50:25.141 --> 01:50:27.643
only achieved at the expense of your uncle?

1525
01:50:28.478 --> 01:50:32.105
Heaven and Earth, are the shades
of Pemberley to be thus polluted?

1526
01:50:32.649 --> 01:50:35.817
Now tell me once and for all,
are you engaged to him?

1527
01:50:38.655 --> 01:50:39.863
I am not.

1528
01:50:42.325 --> 01:50:44.743
And will you promise never to enter
into such an engagement?

1529
01:50:44.827 --> 01:50:47.162
I will not, and I certainly never shall.

1530
01:50:48.998 --> 01:50:51.582
You have insulted me in every possible way

1531
01:50:51.667 --> 01:50:54.043
and can now have nothing further to say.

1532
01:50:55.504 --> 01:50:57.880
I must ask you to leave immediately.

1533
01:51:00.509 --> 01:51:01.717
Good night.

1534
01:51:03.929 --> 01:51:07.098
I have never been thus treated
in my entire life!

1535
01:51:08.976 --> 01:51:11.936
- Lizzie, what on earth is going on?
- It's just a small misunderstanding.

1536
01:51:12.020 --> 01:51:12.979
Lizzie.

1537
01:51:13.063 --> 01:51:15.690
Oh, for once in your life, leave me alone!

1538
01:54:05.313 --> 01:54:08.441
- I couldn't sleep.
- Nor I. My aunt...

1539
01:54:08.525 --> 01:54:10.109
Yes. She was here.

1540
01:54:11.319 --> 01:54:14.196
How can I ever make amends for such behaviour?

1541
01:54:14.865 --> 01:54:18.951
After what you have done for Lydia,
and I suspect for Jane also,

1542
01:54:19.035 --> 01:54:21.202
it is I who should be making amends.

1543
01:54:21.954 --> 01:54:25.874
You must know. Surely you must know
it was all for you.

1544
01:54:29.462 --> 01:54:32.005
You are too generous to trifle with me.

1545
01:54:32.590 --> 01:54:34.466
I believe you spoke with my aunt last night

1546
01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:36.217
and it has taught me to hope

1547
01:54:36.302 --> 01:54:38.845
as I had scarcely allowed myself before.

1548
01:54:40.389 --> 01:54:42.432
If your feelings are still
what they were last April,

1549
01:54:42.516 --> 01:54:43.975
tell me so at once.

1550
01:54:45.603 --> 01:54:48.146
My affections and wishes have not changed,

1551
01:54:48.898 --> 01:54:51.816
but one word from you will silence me forever.

1552
01:54:57.238 --> 01:55:01.074
If, however, your feelings have changed,

1553
01:55:04.162 --> 01:55:08.832
I would have to tell you, you have
bewitched me, body and soul,

1554
01:55:08.917 --> 01:55:12.753
and I love... I love... I love you.

1555
01:55:13.213 --> 01:55:16.089
I never wish to be parted from you
from this day on.

1556
01:55:27.685 --> 01:55:29.019
Well, then.

1557
01:55:34.149 --> 01:55:35.900
Your hands are cold.

1558
01:56:21.195 --> 01:56:23.321
Shut the door, please, Elizabeth.

1559
01:56:34.333 --> 01:56:36.668
Lizzie, are you out of your senses?

1560
01:56:37.587 --> 01:56:39.670
I thought you hated the man.

1561
01:56:39.963 --> 01:56:41.171
No, Papa.

1562
01:56:42.173 --> 01:56:44.758
He's rich, to be sure,

1563
01:56:44.843 --> 01:56:47.928
and you will have more fine carriages than Jane.

1564
01:56:48.888 --> 01:56:50.848
But will that make you happy?

1565
01:56:51.891 --> 01:56:55.561
Have you no other objection
than your belief in my indifference?

1566
01:56:56.146 --> 01:56:57.521
None at all.

1567
01:56:58.398 --> 01:57:02.359
Well, we all know him to be a proud,
unpleasant sort of fellow,

1568
01:57:03.903 --> 01:57:05.946
but this would be nothing
if you really liked him.

1569
01:57:06.031 --> 01:57:07.781
- I do like him.
- Well.

1570
01:57:10.035 --> 01:57:11.368
I love him.

1571
01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:19.834
He's not proud. I was wrong,
I was entirely wrong about him.

1572
01:57:23.047 --> 01:57:24.130
You don't know him, Papa.

1573
01:57:24.214 --> 01:57:27.759
If I told you what he was
really like, what he's done.

1574
01:57:28.802 --> 01:57:30.386
What has he done?

1575
01:57:33.057 --> 01:57:34.891
Mary, look at him.

1576
01:57:38.562 --> 01:57:39.520
But he's so...

1577
01:57:39.605 --> 01:57:42.982
But she doesn't like him.
I thought she didn't like him.

1578
01:57:43.067 --> 01:57:45.068
So did I. So did we all.

1579
01:57:46.570 --> 01:57:48.529
We must have been wrong.

1580
01:57:49.489 --> 01:57:51.239
Wouldn't be the first time, will it?

1581
01:57:51.324 --> 01:57:52.324
No.

1582
01:57:52.784 --> 01:57:54.785
Nor the last, I dare say.

1583
01:58:00.583 --> 01:58:01.917
Good Lord.

1584
01:58:04.921 --> 01:58:07.589
- I must pay him back.
- No.

1585
01:58:08.925 --> 01:58:11.885
You mustn't tell anyone.
He wouldn't want it.

1586
01:58:13.471 --> 01:58:16.014
We misjudged him, Papa, me more than anyone,

1587
01:58:16.599 --> 01:58:19.267
in every way, not just in this matter.

1588
01:58:20.853 --> 01:58:22.729
I've been nonsensical.

1589
01:58:23.773 --> 01:58:27.108
But he's been a fool about Jane,

1590
01:58:27.401 --> 01:58:29.527
about so many other things.

1591
01:58:31.279 --> 01:58:32.488
But then, so have I.

1592
01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:38.202
You see, he and I are...

1593
01:58:40.455 --> 01:58:42.415
He and I are so similar.

1594
01:58:43.959 --> 01:58:45.876
We're both so stubborn.

1595
01:58:48.839 --> 01:58:50.131
Papa, I...

1596
01:58:54.344 --> 01:58:56.637
You really do love him, don't you?

1597
01:58:58.140 --> 01:58:59.431
Very much.

1598
01:59:04.854 --> 01:59:09.107
I cannot believe that anyone can deserve you,

1599
01:59:10.860 --> 01:59:13.695
but it seems I am overruled.

1600
01:59:15.489 --> 01:59:19.325
So I heartily give my consent.

1601
01:59:28.252 --> 01:59:30.837
I could not have parted with you, my Lizzie,

1602
01:59:31.464 --> 01:59:33.006
to anyone less worthy.

1603
01:59:36.176 --> 01:59:38.010
Thank you.

1604
01:59:51.608 --> 01:59:53.650
If any young men come for Mary or Kitty,

1605
01:59:53.735 --> 01:59:57.946
for heaven's sake, send them in,
I'm quite at my leisure.

1606
02:00:21.013 --> 02:00:22.848
How are you this
evening, my dear?

1607
02:00:22.931 --> 02:00:24.224
Very well.

1608
02:00:24.308 --> 02:00:25.851
Only I wish you would not
call me "my dear".

1609
02:00:25.934 --> 02:00:26.894
Why?

1610
02:00:26.977 --> 02:00:28.979
'Cause it's what my father
always calls my mother

1611
02:00:29.062 --> 02:00:30.397
when he's cross
about something.

1612
02:00:30.481 --> 02:00:31.857
What endearments
am I allowed?

1613
02:00:31.940 --> 02:00:33.400
Well, let me think.

1614
02:00:33.650 --> 02:00:35.277
Lizzie, for everyday.

1615
02:00:35.986 --> 02:00:38.489
My pearl, for Sundays.

1616
02:00:39.323 --> 02:00:42.493
And Goddess Divine, but only
on very special occasions.

1617
02:00:43.952 --> 02:00:46.997
And what shall I call you
when I'm cross?

1618
02:00:48.332 --> 02:00:49.666
Mrs. Darcy?

1619
02:00:49.750 --> 02:00:51.960
No. No.

1620
02:00:53.003 --> 02:00:55.130
You may only call me
Mrs. Darcy

1621
02:00:56.173 --> 02:00:58.175
when you are completely

1622
02:00:58.342 --> 02:01:01.428
and perfectly,
and incandescently happy.

1623
02:01:05.015 --> 02:01:08.811
And how are you this
evening, Mrs. Darcy?

1624
02:01:18.195 --> 02:01:34.711
Mrs. Darcy.
