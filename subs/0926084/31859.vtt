1
00:01:12,411 --> 00:01:14,811
Charles, you have finally
lost your senses

2
00:01:14,812 --> 00:01:17,453
This venture is impossible.

3
00:01:17,454 --> 00:01:18,305
For some.

4
00:01:18,306 --> 00:01:22,187
Gentlemen, the only way to achieve the
impossible is to believe it IS possible.

5
00:01:22,188 --> 00:01:24,164
That kind of thinking could ruin you

6
00:01:24,165 --> 00:01:25,983
I'm willing to take that chance.

7
00:01:25,984 --> 00:01:31,423
Imagine a trading post
in Rangoon! Bangkok, Jakarta!

8
00:01:36,442 --> 00:01:38,200
The nightmare again?

9
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:45,124
I won't be long

10
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:47,699
I'm falling

11
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,448
Down a dark hole.

12
00:01:50,449 --> 00:01:54,372
Then I see strange creatures.

13
00:01:54,373 --> 00:01:56,735
What kind of creatures?

14
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:01,154
There's a dodo bird,
a rabbit in a waist coat

15
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:03,344
and a smiling cat

16
00:02:03,345 --> 00:02:05,851
I did not know cats could smile.

17
00:02:05,852 --> 00:02:07,856
Neither did I.

18
00:02:07,857 --> 00:02:11,566
And there is a blue caterpillar.

19
00:02:11,567 --> 00:02:13,938
A blue caterpillar?

20
00:02:16,923 --> 00:02:19,648
Do you think I've gone round the bend?

21
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:26,070
I'm afraid so.

22
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:30,058
You're mad, bonkers, off your head

23
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:32,429
But I'll tell you a secret.

24
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,200
All the best people are.

25
00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:39,060
It's only a dream, Alice,
nothing can harm you there.

26
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:42,245
But if you get too frightened,
You can always wake up.

27
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:43,946
Like this

28
00:03:04,303 --> 00:03:05,709
Must we go?

29
00:03:07,095 --> 00:03:09,566
I doubt he'll notice
if we never arrive

30
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:11,212
He will notice

31
00:03:14,057 --> 00:03:15,719
Where 's your corset?

32
00:03:21,482 --> 00:03:24,263
- And no stockings.
- I'm against them.

33
00:03:24,264 --> 00:03:26,225
But you are not properly dressed

34
00:03:26,226 --> 00:03:28,636
Who is to say what is "proper"?

35
00:03:28,637 --> 00:03:32,761
What if it was agreed that "proper"was wearing
a codfish on your head, would you wear it?

36
00:03:32,762 --> 00:03:34,057
Alice ...

37
00:03:34,058 --> 00:03:36,947
For me, a corset is like a codfish

38
00:03:36,948 --> 00:03:38,642
Please, not today.

39
00:03:38,643 --> 00:03:41,223
Father would have laughed.

40
00:03:43,382 --> 00:03:44,478
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:45,636 --> 00:03:48,796
I'm tired.
I didn't sleep well last night.

42
00:03:48,797 --> 00:03:50,994
Did you have bad dreams again?

43
00:03:50,995 --> 00:03:52,719
Only one.

44
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,482
It's always the same, ever since I can remember

45
00:03:56,483 --> 00:03:58,674
Do you think that's normal?

46
00:03:58,675 --> 00:04:01,540
Don't most people have different dreams?

47
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,903
I don't know.

48
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:13,821
There.

49
00:04:13,822 --> 00:04:16,191
You're beautiful.

50
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:18,508
Now, can you manage to smile?

51
00:04:34,835 --> 00:04:37,440
At last.
We thought you'd never arrive

52
00:04:37,441 --> 00:04:40,549
Alice, Hamish is waiting to dance with you .

53
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,036
Go.

54
00:04:45,548 --> 00:04:47,673
You do realize it's well past 4??

55
00:04:47,674 --> 00:04:49,669
Now everything I've been rushed through

56
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,100
- I am sorry.
- Oh, nevermind.

57
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,731
Forgive my wife. She been planning
this affair for over 20 years.

58
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:03,393
If only Charles were here.

59
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,029
My condolences

60
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,399
I think of your husband often.

61
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,757
He was truly a man of vision

62
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:15,867
I hope you don't think I've taken
advantage of your misfortunes

63
00:05:15,868 --> 00:05:17,293
Of course not.

64
00:05:17,294 --> 00:05:19,521
I'm pleased that you've purchased the company.

65
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:24,571
I was a fool for not investing in his mad venture
when I had the chance

66
00:05:25,584 --> 00:05:27,625
Charles thought so too

67
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:49,421
Hamish, do you ever get tired of quadrille?

68
00:05:49,422 --> 00:05:52,195
On the contrary.
I find it envigorating

69
00:05:58,555 --> 00:05:59,887
Do I amuse you?

70
00:05:59,888 --> 00:06:01,223
No.

71
00:06:01,224 --> 00:06:05,878
I had a sudden vision, of all the ladies
in trousers and the men wearing dresses

72
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:08,869
It would be best to keep your visons to yourself.

73
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,693
When in doubt, remain silent.

74
00:06:20,304 --> 00:06:23,149
Pardon us, sir.
Ms. Kingsley is distracted today.

75
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:27,531
- Where is your head?
- I was wondering what it would be like to fly.

76
00:06:28,403 --> 00:06:31,278
Why would you spend your time thinking about
such an impossible thing?

77
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,666
Why wouldn't I?

78
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:36,334
My father said he sometimes believed
in six impossible things

79
00:06:36,335 --> 00:06:38,219
before breakfast.

80
00:06:44,432 --> 00:06:47,458
Alice, meet me at the Gazebo
in precisely ten minutes.

81
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:51,782
We have a secret to tell you.

82
00:06:51,783 --> 00:06:54,034
If you're telling me,
then it's not much of a secret

83
00:06:54,035 --> 00:06:55,916
- Perhaps we shouldn't.
- We decided we should.

84
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:58,557
- If you tell us, we won't be surprised.
- Will you be surprised?

85
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:00,256
Not if you tell me

86
00:07:00,257 --> 00:07:02,398
But now you've brought it up,
you have to

87
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,838
- No, we don't
- In fact, we won't

88
00:07:06,778 --> 00:07:10,218
I wonder if your mother knows that
you two swim naked in the Havershim's pond.

89
00:07:11,476 --> 00:07:13,475
- You wouldn't.
- Oh, but I would

90
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:15,942
There's your mother right now

91
00:07:15,943 --> 00:07:18,445
Hamish is going to ask your hand.

92
00:07:18,446 --> 00:07:21,058
You ruined the surprise.

93
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:24,012
Oh, I could strangle them!

94
00:07:24,013 --> 00:07:27,008
Everyone of us went through so much effort
to keep it a secret

95
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:29,092
Does everyone know?

96
00:07:29,093 --> 00:07:33,106
That's why they've all come.
This is your engagement party.

97
00:07:33,107 --> 00:07:35,429
Hamish will ask you under the gazebo

98
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,392
When you say "yes" ...

99
00:07:37,393 --> 00:07:39,731
But I don't know if I want to marry Hamish.

100
00:07:39,732 --> 00:07:42,990
Who then?
You won't do better than a lord.

101
00:07:46,268 --> 00:07:50,014
You'll soon be 20, Alice.
That pretty face won't last forever.

102
00:07:51,202 --> 00:07:53,615
You don't want to end up like Aunt Imogen.

103
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:56,644
You don't want to be a burden
for mother, do you?

104
00:07:56,645 --> 00:07:57,692
No.

105
00:07:57,693 --> 00:08:00,209
So, you'll marry Hamish.

106
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,748
You'll be as happy as I am with
Lowell and you live will be perfect

107
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,459
It's already decided.

108
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,056
Alice, dear

109
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:10,098
I'll leave you to it.

110
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:14,440
Shall we take a leisurely stroll through
the garden, just you and me?

111
00:08:19,305 --> 00:08:21,110
Do you know what I've always dreaded?

112
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:23,329
The decline of the aristocracy ?

113
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,440
Ugly grandchildren.

114
00:08:25,441 --> 00:08:27,075
But you are lovely.

115
00:08:27,076 --> 00:08:30,139
You are bound to produce little...
Imbeciles!

116
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,896
The gardeners planted white roses
when I specifically asked for red.

117
00:08:33,897 --> 00:08:36,468
You could always paint the roses red

118
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:38,640
What an odd thing to say

119
00:08:38,641 --> 00:08:43,066
You should know that my son
has extremely delicate digestion.

120
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,509
- Did you see that?
- See what?

121
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,450
- It was a rabbit, I think
- Nasty things

122
00:08:50,451 --> 00:08:53,057
I'd enjoy setting the dogs on them

123
00:08:53,058 --> 00:08:57,615
If you serve Hamish the wrong foods,
he could get a blockage.

124
00:08:58,722 --> 00:09:00,919
- Did you see it that time?
- See what?

125
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,710
- The rabbit!
- Don't shout!

126
00:09:02,711 --> 00:09:04,726
Now pay attention.

127
00:09:04,727 --> 00:09:07,401
Hamish said you were easily distracted.

128
00:09:07,402 --> 00:09:08,928
What was I saying?

129
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:11,327
Hamish has a blockage.

130
00:09:11,328 --> 00:09:14,996
I couldn't be more interested,
but you'll have to excuse me

131
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,470
Aunt Imogen!

132
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:25,239
I think I'm going mad.

133
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,078
I keep seeing a rabbit in a waist coat

134
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:31,125
I can't be bothered with your fancy rabbit now

135
00:09:31,126 --> 00:09:33,501
I'm waiting for my fiancee.

136
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:36,184
Your have a fiancee?

137
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:41,620
There! Did you see it?

138
00:09:41,621 --> 00:09:43,516
He's a prince.

139
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:48,686
But alas he can not marry me
unless he renounces his thrown

140
00:09:48,687 --> 00:09:51,846
- It's tragic, isn't it?
- Very.

141
00:10:02,216 --> 00:10:03,818
Lowell?

142
00:10:05,046 --> 00:10:06,840
Alice! We were just ...

143
00:10:07,685 --> 00:10:09,270
Kat is an old friend.

144
00:10:09,271 --> 00:10:11,772
I can see you're very close.

145
00:10:11,773 --> 00:10:14,568
You won't mention this to your sister,
will you?

146
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:15,944
I don't know.

147
00:10:15,945 --> 00:10:19,088
I'm confused.
I need time to think

148
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:20,716
Well, think About Margaret.

149
00:10:20,717 --> 00:10:22,995
She'd never trust me again

150
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:26,182
- You don't want to ruin her marriage, do you?
- Me?

151
00:10:26,183 --> 00:10:31,259
But I'm not the one who is sneaking
around behind her back...

152
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,048
There you are.

153
00:10:45,752 --> 00:10:49,106
- Alice Kingsley ...
- Hamish.

154
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:52,948
- What is it?
- You have a caterpillar on your shoulder.

155
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
Ew!

156
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,250
Don't hurt it.

157
00:11:03,608 --> 00:11:05,326
You'll want to wash that finger.

158
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:13,362
Alice Kingsley ...

159
00:11:17,016 --> 00:11:19,583
Will you be my wife?

160
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,325
Well...

161
00:11:26,501 --> 00:11:28,914
Everyone expects me to

162
00:11:28,915 --> 00:11:32,116
And, you're a Lord.

163
00:11:32,117 --> 00:11:36,934
My face won't last and
I don't want to end up like..

164
00:11:40,612 --> 00:11:43,340
But this is happening so quickly, I...

165
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,756
I think I ...
I need a moment.

166
00:12:37,394 --> 00:12:39,026
Hello!?

167
00:15:42,055 --> 00:15:43,940
It's only a dream.

168
00:16:25,992 --> 00:16:29,668
You'd think she'd remember all
this from the first time.

169
00:16:31,314 --> 00:16:33,920
You brought the wrong Alice.

170
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:36,622
She's the right one.
I'm certain of it.

171
00:17:23,046 --> 00:17:26,814
- She's the wrong Alice!
- Give her a chance.

172
00:18:43,949 --> 00:18:46,568
Curiouser and curiouser

173
00:18:52,294 --> 00:18:53,912
I told you she's the right Alice

174
00:18:53,913 --> 00:18:56,726
- I am not convinced.
- How is that for gratitude?

175
00:18:56,727 --> 00:19:00,496
I was out there for weeks,
trailing one Alice after the next

176
00:19:00,497 --> 00:19:02,990
and I was almost eaten
by other animals.

177
00:19:02,991 --> 00:19:06,204
Can you imagine ...
They go about entirely unclothed

178
00:19:06,304 --> 00:19:09,130
And they do there shukm in public,
I had to avert my eyes

179
00:19:09,131 --> 00:19:11,776
-Doesn't look anything like herself!

180
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:14,532
That's because she the wrong Alice!

181
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:17,138
- If she was, she might be.
- But if she isn't, she ain't

182
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:19,826
- But if she was so, she would be.
- But she isn't, no how!

183
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:23,084
How can I be the wrong Alice
when this is my dream?

184
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,392
And who are you if i might ask?

185
00:19:26,393 --> 00:19:28,018
Oh, I'm Tweedledee and he's Tweedledum.

186
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:30,345
Cherry wise,
I'm Tweedledum and he's Tweedledee.

187
00:19:30,346 --> 00:19:32,754
- We should consult Absolum.
- Exactly!

188
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:35,465
- Absolem'll know who she is.
- Alice, come on dear.

189
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,967
- It's not being your turn, it's so unfair, hey! Leave off her!
- Let go!

190
00:19:39,968 --> 00:19:42,369
- Are they always this way?
- It's a family trade.

191
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,874
You can both escort her

192
00:19:52,977 --> 00:19:56,100
- Who is this Absolem?
- He's wise. He's Absolute ...

193
00:19:56,101 --> 00:19:57,101
He's absolute!

194
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,742
Who are you?

195
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:27,965
- Absolem!?
- You're not Absolem. I'm Absolem.

196
00:20:27,966 --> 00:20:33,002
The question is ...
Who are you?

197
00:20:33,003 --> 00:20:36,227
- Alice.
- We shall see.

198
00:20:36,228 --> 00:20:39,575
What do you mean by that?
I ought to know who I am

199
00:20:39,576 --> 00:20:42,686
Yes, you ought. Stupid girl!

200
00:20:42,687 --> 00:20:46,203
Unroll the Oraculum.

201
00:20:51,621 --> 00:20:56,475
The Oraculum, being the
calendrical compemdium of Underland

202
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,466
- It's a calender.
- Compendium.

203
00:21:02,467 --> 00:21:08,092
It tells of each and every day
since the beginning

204
00:21:08,093 --> 00:21:12,702
Today is Gribling day,
in the time of the Red Queen

205
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:18,270
Show her the Frabjus Day.

206
00:21:18,271 --> 00:21:21,763
Yes, Frabjus, being the day you
slay the Jabberwocky

207
00:21:21,764 --> 00:21:25,197
Sorry?
Slay the what?

208
00:21:25,198 --> 00:21:28,157
That being you there with the
Vorpal sword.

209
00:21:28,158 --> 00:21:30,832
No other swords can kill the
Jabberwocky. No how.

210
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,419
If it ain't Vorpal, ain't dead

211
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:37,130
- That's not me.
- I know!

212
00:21:37,131 --> 00:21:41,554
Resolve this for us, Absolem.
Is she the right Alice?

213
00:21:41,555 --> 00:21:44,548
Not hardly.

214
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,320
I told ya!

215
00:21:49,321 --> 00:21:51,874
- I said so
- I said so

216
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,654
Contrary wise,
you said she might be.

217
00:21:53,655 --> 00:21:55,950
No, you said she would be if
she was.

218
00:21:55,951 --> 00:21:59,748
Little Impostor! Pretending to be Alice!
She should be ashamed!

219
00:21:59,749 --> 00:22:04,133
- I was so certain of you.
- I'm sorry, I don't mean to be the wrong Alice!

220
00:22:05,673 --> 00:22:06,726
Wait.

221
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:09,262
This is my dream.

222
00:22:09,263 --> 00:22:12,088
I'm going to wake up now and
you'll disappear.

223
00:22:20,536 --> 00:22:23,901
That's odd.
Pinching usually does the trick

224
00:22:23,902 --> 00:22:27,502
- I could stick you if that would help?
- It might actually, thank you.

225
00:22:27,503 --> 00:22:29,174
My pleasure!

226
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,238
Bandersnatch!

227
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:27,617
Wait.

228
00:23:30,266 --> 00:23:31,884
It's only a dream.

229
00:23:31,885 --> 00:23:33,932
Nothing can hurt me.

230
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:41,212
- What is she doing?
- He can't hurt me, he can't hurt me ...

231
00:23:47,828 --> 00:23:49,713
Run, you great love!

232
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:49,949
SNUD        QUEAST

233
00:24:54,176 --> 00:24:56,058
- This way!
- East to QUEAST.

234
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:57,988
No! South to SNUD!

235
00:25:47,031 --> 00:25:50,352
Someone has stolen three of my tarts!

236
00:25:58,702 --> 00:26:00,546
- Did You steal them?
- No, Your Majesty.

237
00:26:01,571 --> 00:26:03,117
- Did You?
- No, Your Majesty.

238
00:26:03,118 --> 00:26:05,396
- Did You steal them?
- No, Your Majesty.

239
00:26:38,817 --> 00:26:43,116
- Did you steal my tart?
- No, Your Majesty ...

240
00:26:50,219 --> 00:26:51,936
It's cranberry juice.

241
00:26:51,937 --> 00:26:55,024
- I was so hungry! I didn't mean to ...
- Off with his head!

242
00:26:55,025 --> 00:26:59,211
My family! No, please, please don't!
I have little ones to look after!

243
00:26:59,212 --> 00:27:00,807
Go to his house
and collect the little ones.

244
00:27:00,808 --> 00:27:03,579
I like frog eggs on toast almost
as much as I like caviar.

245
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,243
Yes, your Majesty

246
00:27:08,621 --> 00:27:09,688
Drink.

247
00:27:15,232 --> 00:27:16,711
Majesty.

248
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:22,401
Ilosovic Stayne

249
00:27:22,402 --> 00:27:24,792
Where have you been lurking?

250
00:27:24,793 --> 00:27:32,005
Majesty ...
I have found the Oraculum

251
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:36,763
That? Looks so ordinary
for an Oraculum.

252
00:27:36,764 --> 00:27:40,093
Look here. Frabjus Day.

253
00:27:42,567 --> 00:27:45,209
I'd know that tangled mess of hair anywhere.

254
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,344
Is it Alice?

255
00:27:47,345 --> 00:27:49,921
I believe it is.

256
00:27:49,922 --> 00:27:52,583
What is she doing with my darling Jabberwocky?

257
00:27:52,584 --> 00:27:55,148
She appears to be slating it

258
00:27:55,149 --> 00:27:57,705
She killed my Jabberbabywocky?

259
00:27:57,706 --> 00:28:02,715
Not yet. But it will happen
if we don't stop her.

260
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:06,104
Find Alice, Stayne.
Find her!

261
00:28:08,662 --> 00:28:11,847
Find the scent of human girl
and earn your freedom.

262
00:28:11,848 --> 00:28:14,474
For my wife and pups as well?

263
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,362
Everyone will go home.

264
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:35,038
Dogs will believe anything.

265
00:29:07,577 --> 00:29:11,898
It looks like you ran afoul of
something with wicked claws

266
00:29:12,773 --> 00:29:16,091
- I must be still dreaming ...
- What did that to you?

267
00:29:16,092 --> 00:29:19,519
- A "bander" or "bandips" ...
- A Bandersnatch?

268
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,229
- Well, I'd better have a look.
- What are you doing?

269
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:28,186
It needs to by purified by someone
with evaporating skills

270
00:29:28,187 --> 00:29:31,740
or it will fester and putrify

271
00:29:31,741 --> 00:29:35,820
I'd rather you didn't.
I'll be fine as soon as I wake up.

272
00:29:35,821 --> 00:29:39,141
At least let me bind it for you

273
00:29:40,632 --> 00:29:43,932
- What do you call yourself?
- Alice.

274
00:29:43,933 --> 00:29:46,262
THE Alice?

275
00:29:46,263 --> 00:29:48,737
There has been some debate about that

276
00:29:48,738 --> 00:29:51,349
I never get involved in politics.

277
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:54,005
You'd best be on your way.

278
00:29:54,006 --> 00:29:58,013
What way? All I want to do
is wake up from this dream.

279
00:29:58,014 --> 00:30:04,359
Fine. I'll take you to the Hare
and the Hatter, but that's the end of it

280
00:30:13,185 --> 00:30:14,569
Coming?

281
00:31:04,985 --> 00:31:06,838
Watch what you're doing!

282
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:13,620
It's you!

283
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:17,109
No it's not.
The Twisp brought us the wrong Alice

284
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:20,428
- Its the wrong Alice?
- It's absolutely Alice.

285
00:31:20,429 --> 00:31:23,485
You're absolutely Alice.
I'd know you anywhere.

286
00:31:23,486 --> 00:31:25,622
I'd know him anywhere!

287
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:30,777
Well, as you can see,
we're still having tea.

288
00:31:30,778 --> 00:31:34,724
And it's all because I was obliged
to kill time waiting for your return.

289
00:31:34,725 --> 00:31:37,019
You're terribly late, you know
Naughty!

290
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:43,000
Well anyway, time to came quite offended
has stopped all together. Not a tick off a finger

291
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:47,336
- Cup.
- Time can be funny in dreams.

292
00:31:47,337 --> 00:31:49,400
Yes, yes, of course,
but now you're back, you see.

293
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,500
- And we need to get on to the Frabjus Day.
- Frabjus Day!

294
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:58,229
I've been investigating things that begin with
the letter "M".

295
00:31:59,609 --> 00:32:03,087
Have you any idea why a raven is
like a writing desk?

296
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,875
- "Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid
"!
- What?

297
00:32:05,876 --> 00:32:07,806
"Down with the Bloody Big Head"

298
00:32:07,807 --> 00:32:10,130
Bloody Big Head, being The Red Queen

299
00:32:10,131 --> 00:32:12,606
Come, come we simply must commit to the slaying
in such

300
00:32:12,607 --> 00:32:16,004
Therefore, is it high time to forgive and forget
or forgive and forgive

301
00:32:16,005 --> 00:32:20,486
whichever comes first, or is in any case
the most convenient, I'm waiting.

302
00:32:20,487 --> 00:32:22,950
It's ticking, it's ticking again

303
00:32:22,951 --> 00:32:27,526
All this talk of blood and slaying has
put me off my tea

304
00:32:29,628 --> 00:32:34,852
The entire world is falling to ruin and
poor Chester is off his tea.

305
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:39,853
What happened that day was not... my fault

306
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,365
Oh, dear

307
00:32:42,766 --> 00:32:45,730
Your were out and then
to save your own skin

308
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:51,992
You gutless Scottisch pelgrim juggling
slurking urpal slackush scrum Barlemot

309
00:32:51,993 --> 00:32:53,038
Hatter!

310
00:32:54,327 --> 00:32:55,378
Thank you.

311
00:32:57,137 --> 00:32:58,088
I'm fine

312
00:32:58,089 --> 00:33:01,697
What wrong with you, Tarrant?
You used to be the light of the party.

313
00:33:01,698 --> 00:33:04,475
You used to do the best Futterwacken
in all of WitzEnd

314
00:33:04,476 --> 00:33:05,730
Futter what?

315
00:33:05,731 --> 00:33:08,067
It's a dance.

316
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,976
One day, Frabjus Day,

317
00:33:11,977 --> 00:33:14,898
when the White Queen once again
wears the crown

318
00:33:14,899 --> 00:33:21,526
On that day I shall Futterwacken ...
vigorously.

319
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:26,372
Oh no!

320
00:33:30,517 --> 00:33:32,598
- The Knave
- Goodbye.

321
00:33:35,152 --> 00:33:36,494
Drink this quickly.

322
00:33:44,174 --> 00:33:45,114
Oh, dear

323
00:34:08,376 --> 00:34:09,900
Let me out!

324
00:34:12,514 --> 00:34:18,162
Well!
If it's not my favorite trio of lunatics.

325
00:34:18,197 --> 00:34:20,254
Would you like to join us?

326
00:34:22,217 --> 00:34:24,020
You're all late for tea!

327
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,242
I'm looking the girl
called ... Alice.

328
00:34:33,243 --> 00:34:34,913
Speaking of the Queen,

329
00:34:34,914 --> 00:34:37,260
Here's a little song we used
to sing in her honour.

330
00:34:37,261 --> 00:34:41,686
Twinkle, twinkle little red
how I wonder where you're at

331
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:47,835
If you're hiding her,
you'll lose your heads.

332
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,652
Already lost them.

333
00:34:51,396 --> 00:34:52,553
All together now!

334
00:34:52,554 --> 00:34:56,746
Up Above the world you fly,
like a tea tray in the sky

335
00:34:56,747 --> 00:35:01,939
Twinkle, twinkle little
Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle,twinkle

336
00:35:09,843 --> 00:35:11,699
Don't be bloody beggin'!

337
00:35:16,134 --> 00:35:17,520
Would you like some tea?

338
00:35:22,003 --> 00:35:24,541
Follow the blood hound

339
00:35:25,424 --> 00:35:27,318
- Sugar?
- Yes, please.

340
00:35:29,493 --> 00:35:32,395
- You're all mad !
- Thanks very much.

341
00:35:35,713 --> 00:35:37,117
Pass the scones, please.

342
00:35:55,216 --> 00:35:56,619
Try this on for size.

343
00:36:08,423 --> 00:36:09,630
I like it!

344
00:36:09,631 --> 00:36:12,721
Good thing the blood hound is one
of us, or you'd be...

345
00:36:13,777 --> 00:36:14,887
What do they want with me?

346
00:36:14,888 --> 00:36:18,253
Best take her to the
White Queen, she'd be safe there!

347
00:36:18,254 --> 00:36:20,563
Spoon.

348
00:36:23,234 --> 00:36:26,022
- Your carriage, m'lady.
- The Hat ?

349
00:36:26,023 --> 00:36:27,474
Of course!

350
00:36:27,475 --> 00:36:29,344
Anyone can go by horse
or rail

351
00:36:29,345 --> 00:36:32,968
But the absolute best way to travel
is by hat

352
00:36:32,969 --> 00:36:35,042
Have I made a rhyme?

353
00:36:35,043 --> 00:36:38,133
I love travelling by hat!

354
00:36:38,134 --> 00:36:41,033
Mally,just Alice, please
Fairfallen all!

355
00:36:49,183 --> 00:36:53,995
Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wab

356
00:36:53,996 --> 00:36:58,271
All mumsy were the borogoves
And the mome raths outgrabe

357
00:36:58,272 --> 00:36:59,820
Sorry, what was that ?

358
00:37:01,139 --> 00:37:03,213
What was what?

359
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:09,724
The Jabberwock with eyes of flame,
jaws that bite and claws that catch

360
00:37:09,725 --> 00:37:15,241
Beware of the Jubjub bird,my son
The frumnious Bandersnatch!.

361
00:37:15,242 --> 00:37:18,814
He took his Vorpal sword in hand

362
00:37:18,815 --> 00:37:21,402
The Vorpal blade went snicker-snack

363
00:37:21,403 --> 00:37:24,266
He left it dead, and with its head

364
00:37:25,301 --> 00:37:28,200
He went galumphing back

365
00:37:29,741 --> 00:37:31,893
It's all about you, you know

366
00:37:31,894 --> 00:37:36,431
I'm not slaying anything , I don't slay,
so put it out of you mind!

367
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:42,848
Mind?

368
00:37:49,866 --> 00:37:52,057
Wait! You can't leave me here!

369
00:37:55,051 --> 00:37:56,831
You don't slay?

370
00:37:56,832 --> 00:37:59,985
Do you have any idea what
the Red Queen has done?

371
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,399
You don't slay?

372
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,611
I couldn't if I wanted to

373
00:38:07,313 --> 00:38:09,609
You're not the same as you were before

374
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:15,088
You were much more, muchier
You lost your muchness

375
00:38:15,089 --> 00:38:17,022
"My muchness?

376
00:38:18,182 --> 00:38:20,699
In there, something's missing

377
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,008
Tell me what Red Queen has done

378
00:38:26,116 --> 00:38:28,218
It's not a pretty story.

379
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:30,144
Tell me anyway.

380
00:38:41,614 --> 00:38:43,829
It was here

381
00:38:44,935 --> 00:38:47,545
I was the Hatter to the
White Queen at the time

382
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,050
I took clan of all that's
been employed at court

383
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,900
Hatter ...
Hatter!

384
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I'm fine.

385
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,421
Are you?

386
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,900
Did you hear that?
I'm certain I heard something.

387
00:40:58,083 --> 00:40:58,400
What?

388
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,050
Oo, Red Knave

389
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:40,193
Go south to Trottler's Bottom
The White Queen's castle is just beyond.

390
00:41:40,194 --> 00:41:42,186
Hold on tightly.

391
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,886
Done it with the Bloody Red Queen!

392
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,884
You were supposed to lead them away!
The Hatter trusted you!

393
00:42:51,885 --> 00:42:54,015
They have my wife and pups

394
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,989
- What is your name?
- Bayard.

395
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:58,845
Sit!

396
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,636
Would your name be Alice,
by any chance?

397
00:43:03,637 --> 00:43:06,629
Yes, but I'm not the one that
everybody is talking About

398
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:10,170
The Hatter would have given himself
up just for any Alice.

399
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:11,760
Where did they take him?

400
00:43:11,761 --> 00:43:14,890
To the Red Queen's Castle,
it's Salazen Grum.

401
00:43:14,891 --> 00:43:17,403
We're going to rescue him.

402
00:43:17,404 --> 00:43:18,404
That is not foretold

403
00:43:18,504 --> 00:43:20,229
I don't care!

404
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:22,621
He wouldn't be there,
if I weren't for me

405
00:43:22,622 --> 00:43:25,456
The Frabjus day is almost upon us.

406
00:43:25,457 --> 00:43:28,252
You must prepare to meet the Jabberwocky.

407
00:43:28,253 --> 00:43:32,561
From the moment I fell down that rabbit hole,
I have been told what I must do and who I must be.

408
00:43:32,562 --> 00:43:36,902
I've been shrunk, stretched, scratched and
stuffed into a teapot.

409
00:43:36,903 --> 00:43:40,920
I've been accused of being Alice and of
not being Alice, but this is my dream.

410
00:43:40,921 --> 00:43:43,433
I'll decide where it goes from here!

411
00:43:43,434 --> 00:43:45,700
If you diverge from the path...

412
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,203
I make the path!

413
00:43:58,557 --> 00:44:01,953
Take me to Salazen Grum, Bayard,
and don't forget the hat.

414
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,300
There's only one way across

415
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,150
I've lost my muchness, have I?

416
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,500
Bayard! The hat!

417
00:46:14,227 --> 00:46:15,500
Your Majesty.

418
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,500
So sorry

419
00:46:35,651 --> 00:46:37,306
Splendid shot!

420
00:46:40,022 --> 00:46:41,829
Where's my ball?
Page!

421
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:43,565
Yes, Your Majesty.

422
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,104
I want to help you

423
00:46:53,523 --> 00:46:55,888
Well, If it isn't the wrong Alice

424
00:46:57,222 --> 00:46:58,660
What brings you here?

425
00:46:58,661 --> 00:47:00,689
I've come to rescue the Hatter.

426
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:03,146
You won't be rescuing anyone being the
size of a jerbel.

427
00:47:03,147 --> 00:47:06,050
Do you have any more of that cake
that made me grow before?

428
00:47:06,051 --> 00:47:09,176
"Upelkuchen?
Actually, i might have some left

429
00:47:19,061 --> 00:47:20,561
Not all of it!

430
00:47:20,562 --> 00:47:24,281
Oh, no stop!
Oh no, don't do that!

431
00:47:28,609 --> 00:47:29,437
Oh dear,

432
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:36,624
And what is this?

433
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:38,889
It's a who, Majesty.

434
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:41,387
This is...umm...

435
00:47:42,385 --> 00:47:43,400
Um?

436
00:47:43,401 --> 00:47:45,665
From Umbridge.

437
00:47:45,666 --> 00:47:48,253
What happened to your clothes?

438
00:47:48,254 --> 00:47:52,519
I outgrew them.
I've been growing an afwul lot lately

439
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,590
I tower over everyone in Umbridge.

440
00:47:55,591 --> 00:47:57,568
They laugh at me.

441
00:47:57,569 --> 00:48:00,889
So I've come to you,
hoping you might understand what it's like.

442
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:05,965
My dear girl, anyone with a head
that large is welcome in my court.

443
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,951
Someone find us some clothes!

444
00:48:07,952 --> 00:48:10,979
Use the curtains, if you must,
but clothe this enormous girl

445
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:22,881
I need a pig here!

446
00:48:28,123 --> 00:48:30,983
I love a warm pig belly for
my aching feet

447
00:48:30,984 --> 00:48:32,658
Would you like one, Um?

448
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:34,967
- No, thank you.
- Sit!

449
00:48:38,404 --> 00:48:39,467
Sit!

450
00:48:43,081 --> 00:48:44,375
Go away!

451
00:48:47,585 --> 00:48:49,846
Where are my fat boys?
You must meet them.

452
00:48:49,847 --> 00:48:51,473
Fat Boys!

453
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,121
Oh there they are.
Aren't they adorable?

454
00:48:57,122 --> 00:49:00,615
They have the oddest way of speaking.
Speak, boys. Amuse us.

455
00:49:08,216 --> 00:49:09,434
Speak!

456
00:49:10,892 --> 00:49:13,066
- Is that being..
- No,no, it is not a bit, no

457
00:49:13,067 --> 00:49:15,658
I'm sure it was, I believe it's so

458
00:49:15,659 --> 00:49:17,930
No it ain't, son. No how

459
00:49:21,216 --> 00:49:22,804
I love my Fat Boys

460
00:49:22,805 --> 00:49:24,528
Now, get out!

461
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:57,600
And.. who is this
lovely creature?

462
00:50:00,143 --> 00:50:03,103
- Um. My new favorite.
- Does she have a name?

463
00:50:03,104 --> 00:50:03,942
Um.

464
00:50:03,943 --> 00:50:07,067
I believe your name has slipped the Queen's mind.

465
00:50:07,068 --> 00:50:09,161
Her name is Um, Idiot!

466
00:50:10,919 --> 00:50:12,303
From Umbridge.

467
00:50:12,304 --> 00:50:14,450
Any luck with the prisoner?

468
00:50:14,451 --> 00:50:16,142
He's stubborn.

469
00:50:16,143 --> 00:50:18,529
Or too soft.

470
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:20,532
Bring him!

471
00:50:44,517 --> 00:50:47,901
We know Alice has returned to Underland,
do you know where she is?

472
00:50:51,061 --> 00:50:54,033
I've been considering things that
begin with the letter M

473
00:50:54,334 --> 00:50:56,699
Moron

474
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:01,311
Mutiny, Murder, Malice

475
00:51:01,312 --> 00:51:04,068
We're looking for an A word now

476
00:51:04,069 --> 00:51:05,803
Where is Alice?

477
00:51:05,804 --> 00:51:10,165
Oh, we a little boy. I wouldn't know.

478
00:51:10,166 --> 00:51:13,047
What if I take off your head?
Will you know then?

479
00:51:14,823 --> 00:51:15,726
Stop that.

480
00:51:17,379 --> 00:51:19,821
What a regrettably large head you have

481
00:51:19,822 --> 00:51:22,515
I would very much like to hat it.

482
00:51:22,516 --> 00:51:24,424
- Hat it?
- Yes.

483
00:51:24,425 --> 00:51:26,687
I used to have the White Queen you know

484
00:51:26,688 --> 00:51:30,577
Wasn't very much to work with, poor dear
Her head is so small

485
00:51:30,578 --> 00:51:33,513
It's tiny.
It's a pimple of a head

486
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,300
But this...

487
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:39,059
What I could do with this monument...

488
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:42,282
this orb...

489
00:51:42,283 --> 00:51:47,351
nay, this magnificently heroic globe

490
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,800
What could you do?

491
00:51:54,448 --> 00:51:56,063
Unbind him, Stayne.

492
00:51:56,064 --> 00:51:58,907
How can he work, if his hands
are bound?

493
00:52:07,912 --> 00:52:08,700
Well then...

494
00:52:10,179 --> 00:52:11,379
Shall it be a bond or a bowlock?

495
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,480
Or something for the boudoir?

496
00:52:26,007 --> 00:52:26,500
Hatter!

497
00:52:32,303 --> 00:52:33,842
Leave us!

498
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:49,572
The true seems sad. 
Have you been speaking with him?

499
00:52:49,573 --> 00:52:50,974
Yes, Your Majesty.

500
00:52:50,975 --> 00:52:53,230
Perhaps a bit more kindly

501
00:52:56,448 --> 00:52:59,409
Would you all excuse me for a moment?
Thank you.

502
00:53:09,815 --> 00:53:13,644
- What news, Bayard?
- Alice has returned to Underland.

503
00:53:13,645 --> 00:53:15,444
Where is she now?

504
00:53:15,445 --> 00:53:17,488
In Salazin Grum.

505
00:53:17,489 --> 00:53:22,358
Forgive me, I allowed her to
divert from her destined path.

506
00:53:22,359 --> 00:53:26,953
No, no, no. That is exactly where 
she'll find the Volpen Sword

507
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:31,387
We have our champion. Rest now.
You have done well!

508
00:53:49,769 --> 00:53:51,729
Have you seen a hat 'round here?

509
00:54:05,794 --> 00:54:07,369
You must find Alice, Stayne.

510
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:10,525
Without the Jabberwocky, my sister's followers
will surely rise against me

511
00:54:12,551 --> 00:54:16,019
My ugly little sister
Why do they adore her, but not me?

512
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,700
I can not fathem it

513
00:54:17,701 --> 00:54:22,758
You are far superior in all ways

514
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:26,480
I know. But Moana can make
anyone fall in love with her.

515
00:54:26,781 --> 00:54:28,300
Men.

516
00:54:29,008 --> 00:54:29,800
Women.

517
00:54:33,905 --> 00:54:35,859
Even the furniture.

518
00:54:37,738 --> 00:54:40,237
Even the.. King?

519
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:49,849
I had to do it.
He would have left me

520
00:54:52,256 --> 00:54:53,368
Majesty ...

521
00:54:55,093 --> 00:54:59,671
Is it not better to be feared
than loved?

522
00:55:00,735 --> 00:55:02,749
Not certain anymore

523
00:55:04,284 --> 00:55:07,950
Oh, let her have the rebel
I don't need them.

524
00:55:07,951 --> 00:55:09,726
I have you.

525
00:55:29,251 --> 00:55:31,682
They're wonderful.

526
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,629
You must let me try one on

527
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:38,169
It is good to be working
at my trade again

528
00:55:39,439 --> 00:55:41,829
It's just a pity you have to
make them for her

529
00:55:47,111 --> 00:55:49,511
What does the hatter with mean?

530
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:51,600
Hatter...

531
00:56:02,935 --> 00:56:04,059
Hatter!

532
00:56:06,012 --> 00:56:09,357
Have you any idea why a raven is
like a writing desk?

533
00:56:09,358 --> 00:56:11,747
I'm frightened, Alice.

534
00:56:11,748 --> 00:56:14,881
I don't like it in here.
It's terribly crowded.

535
00:56:18,939 --> 00:56:21,465
Have I gone mad?

536
00:56:25,666 --> 00:56:28,903
Afraid so.
You're entirely bonkers

537
00:56:28,904 --> 00:56:32,228
But I'll tell you a secret.

538
00:56:32,229 --> 00:56:34,975
All the best people are.

539
00:56:42,497 --> 00:56:43,100
Here.

540
00:56:46,523 --> 00:56:49,469
That's better.
You look yourself again.

541
00:56:52,297 --> 00:56:55,920
Hat man? Where are my hats
I'm not a patient person

542
00:56:56,041 --> 00:56:58,563
I'm told she keeps the Vorpal sword hidden in the castle.

543
00:56:58,564 --> 00:57:03,473
The rabbit will help you.
Find it, Alice. Take it to the White Queen.

544
00:57:03,474 --> 00:57:05,382
We'll go to the White Queen together.

545
00:57:05,383 --> 00:57:10,566
Why is it, you're always to small or to tall?

546
00:57:22,624 --> 00:57:25,403
- Tweedles
- Alice, how do ya doing, kid?

547
00:57:25,404 --> 00:57:28,143
- Where's the rabbit?
- How is it, you're being so great big?

548
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:30,494
She ain't great big.
This is how she normal is

549
00:57:30,495 --> 00:57:32,720
I'm certain she's smaller when we met

550
00:57:32,721 --> 00:57:36,094
No, she drank the "pishalver" to get
through the door, recall it?

551
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:37,500
Oh, yeah.

552
00:57:37,894 --> 00:57:39,754
- Where's the rabbit?
- Over this.

553
00:57:49,444 --> 00:57:51,529
- What are you doing here?
- I'm rescuing The Hatter.

554
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:53,300
I'm rescuing The Hatter!

555
00:57:53,301 --> 00:57:55,782
He told me that the Vorpal sword
is hidden in the castle.

556
00:57:55,783 --> 00:57:57,295
Help me find it!

557
00:57:57,296 --> 00:58:00,340
I don't take orders from big,
clumpsy, galumphing...

558
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,150
Shoo.

559
00:58:05,481 --> 00:58:08,598
- What is it, Big Twisp?
- I, I know where the sword is.

560
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:17,334
The sword is hidden inside.

561
00:58:19,001 --> 00:58:20,676
Be careful, Alice.

562
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,250
I know that smell.

563
00:58:41,441 --> 00:58:42,990
I'm not going in there!

564
00:58:42,991 --> 00:58:46,585
Look what that thing did to my arm!

565
00:58:46,586 --> 00:58:50,444
Dear, oh dear.
Why haven't you mentioned this?

566
00:58:50,445 --> 00:58:52,866
It wasn't this bad before

567
00:59:08,228 --> 00:59:09,448
Hatter!

568
00:59:10,116 --> 00:59:12,200
Where are you?

569
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:14,600
Hatter!

570
00:59:15,789 --> 00:59:17,068
Mallyumkun.

571
00:59:17,069 --> 00:59:19,615
Do you still have the
Bandersnatch eye ?

572
00:59:19,616 --> 00:59:21,493
Right here.

573
00:59:21,494 --> 00:59:24,451
- I need it.
- Come and get it.

574
00:59:27,261 --> 00:59:28,667
Hey! Give it back!

575
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:47,200
I like you Um
I like large things ...

576
00:59:47,566 --> 00:59:49,165
Get away from me!

577
01:00:07,265 --> 01:00:08,755
I have your eye.

578
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:22,925
No.

579
01:01:26,998 --> 01:01:31,600
- You look stunning in that hat.
- Yes. Next!

580
01:01:34,947 --> 01:01:37,863
Your Majesty has never looked
better!

581
01:01:37,864 --> 01:01:39,805
Another!

582
01:01:50,621 --> 01:01:54,981
I don't wish to alarm you, but it smell as
though you might have dropped something.

583
01:02:08,681 --> 01:02:10,873
Oh, don't mind him, he's mad.
Come along!

584
01:02:17,161 --> 01:02:20,350
Stayne!

585
01:03:14,236 --> 01:03:16,658
I suppose this makes us even now

586
01:03:57,035 --> 01:04:01,867
Um forced herself on me. I told her
my heart belongs to you

587
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,750
She's obsessed with me.

588
01:04:10,978 --> 01:04:12,789
Off with her head!

589
01:04:15,663 --> 01:04:19,233
Stand back, Mallyumkun.
How's this for muchness?

590
01:04:19,234 --> 01:04:21,287
It mustn't be used for anything...

591
01:04:23,449 --> 01:04:26,409
Arrest that girl
for unlawful seduction!

592
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:27,805
Hatter!

593
01:04:30,141 --> 01:04:32,490
- Take it to the White Queen!
- I'm not leaving without you!

594
01:04:32,791 --> 01:04:33,891
Go!

595
01:05:00,265 --> 01:05:02,476
Run...
Alice!

596
01:05:05,252 --> 01:05:06,667
Alice.

597
01:05:07,742 --> 01:05:08,915
Run!

598
01:05:14,307 --> 01:05:15,893
Seize her!

599
01:05:27,353 --> 01:05:28,481
Alice ...

600
01:05:29,531 --> 01:05:31,679
Of course
Why didn't I see it?

601
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:37,635
But it has been a long time
and you were such a little tike then

602
01:05:37,636 --> 01:05:40,323
Give me the sword.

603
01:05:41,502 --> 01:05:43,831
- Stay back.
- The queen will be so pleased

604
01:05:43,832 --> 01:05:48,287
She will take great pleasure
in taking off your head.

605
01:06:08,913 --> 01:06:10,569
Ho! Alice!

606
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:12,728
Bayard!
To Marmoreal!

607
01:06:21,089 --> 01:06:23,979
Majesty ...
Alice has escaped.

608
01:06:28,113 --> 01:06:30,949
On...the Bandersnatch.

609
01:06:33,244 --> 01:06:36,369
With ... the Vorpal sword.

610
01:06:39,007 --> 01:06:40,891
How could you let this happen?

611
01:06:40,892 --> 01:06:44,400
I may have underestimated her

612
01:06:44,401 --> 01:06:52,197
But we have her conspirators.
The Hatter and a door mouse.

613
01:06:52,198 --> 01:06:54,391
Off with their heads!

614
01:07:13,709 --> 01:07:17,109
- Welcome to Marmoreal.
- I believe this belongs to you.

615
01:07:31,051 --> 01:07:33,604
The Vorpal sword is home again

616
01:07:35,888 --> 01:07:38,121
The Armor is complete

617
01:07:41,113 --> 01:07:44,853
Now all we need is a champion

618
01:07:46,322 --> 01:07:48,467
You're a little taller than
I thought you'd be

619
01:07:48,567 --> 01:07:50,995
Blame it on too much Upelkuchen.

620
01:07:51,632 --> 01:07:53,357
Come with me.

621
01:07:59,593 --> 01:08:01,459
Is the March Hare here?

622
01:08:05,527 --> 01:08:06,775
It could use some salt.

623
01:08:12,434 --> 01:08:13,000
Yes, that's great

624
01:08:15,115 --> 01:08:18,192
Be sure about it, we need...

625
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,493
A pinch of worm fat

626
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:25,250
A rhine of a horsefly.

627
01:08:27,432 --> 01:08:29,700
Buttered fingers.

628
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:39,200
My sister prefered to study
"Dominion Of The Living Things"

629
01:08:40,704 --> 01:08:45,400
- Tell me, how did she seem to you?
- Perfectly horrid

630
01:08:46,009 --> 01:08:51,600
- And... her head?
- Bulbous

631
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:57,530
I think she might have some growth
in there, something pressing on her brain

632
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:59,193
Three coins from a dead man's pocket

633
01:09:01,194 --> 01:09:03,466
Two tea spoons of "wishful thinking".

634
01:09:03,467 --> 01:09:06,481
You can't iamgine the things that
go on in that place

635
01:09:07,539 --> 01:09:09,211
Oh, yes I can.

636
01:09:09,212 --> 01:09:14,258
But when a champion steps
forward to slay the Jabberwocky,

637
01:09:14,259 --> 01:09:17,143
the people will rise against her.

638
01:09:20,257 --> 01:09:21,597
That should do it!

639
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:26,703
Blow.

640
01:09:40,857 --> 01:09:43,121
- Feel better?
- Much. Thank you.

641
01:09:43,122 --> 01:09:45,665
There's someone here who'd like
to speak with you

642
01:10:06,866 --> 01:10:09,354
- Absolem!
- Who are you?

643
01:10:13,634 --> 01:10:15,249
I thought we'd settled this

644
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:18,122
I'm Alice, but not that one

645
01:10:18,123 --> 01:10:19,555
How do you know?

646
01:10:19,556 --> 01:10:21,566
You've said so yourself

647
01:10:21,567 --> 01:10:23,623
I said you were not hardly Alice,

648
01:10:23,624 --> 01:10:28,315
but you're much more her now.
In fact, you're almost Alice.

649
01:10:28,316 --> 01:10:31,756
Even so, I couldn't slay the
Jabberwocky

650
01:10:31,856 --> 01:10:33,796
if my life depended on it

651
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:35,105
It will

652
01:10:35,401 --> 01:10:40,800
So I suggest you keep the Vorpal Sword
on hand when the Frabjus Day arrives

653
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:42,800
You seem so real.

654
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:46,576
Sometimes I forget that this is all a dream.

655
01:10:50,195 --> 01:10:51,621
Will you stop doing that?

656
01:11:11,769 --> 01:11:14,344
I've always admired
that hat.

657
01:11:14,345 --> 01:11:16,565
Hello, Chess.

658
01:11:17,338 --> 01:11:19,660
Since you wouldn't be needing it anymore

659
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,125
would you consider begrieving it to me

660
01:11:24,126 --> 01:11:26,086
How dare you?

661
01:11:26,087 --> 01:11:29,575
Tis a formal execution.
I would like to look my best, you know

662
01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:32,745
It's a pity about all this

663
01:11:32,746 --> 01:11:35,963
I was looking forward to seeing
you Futterwacken

664
01:11:35,964 --> 01:11:38,772
I was rather good at it, was I not?

665
01:11:38,773 --> 01:11:42,296
I really DO love that hat.

666
01:11:43,256 --> 01:11:46,458
I'd wear to all the finest occasions.

667
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:55,856
I love a morning execution
Don't you?

668
01:11:55,857 --> 01:11:57,568
Yes, Your Majesty.

669
01:12:41,498 --> 01:12:44,437
- I'd like to keep it on.
- Suit yourself

670
01:12:44,438 --> 01:12:46,736
As long as I can get at your neck

671
01:12:49,466 --> 01:12:51,523
I'm right behind you

672
01:12:51,524 --> 01:12:53,905
- Off with his head!
- I can't watch.

673
01:13:28,134 --> 01:13:30,016
Good morning, everyone.

674
01:13:30,017 --> 01:13:32,965
Chess, you dog!

675
01:13:35,302 --> 01:13:36,371
Madam?

676
01:13:36,372 --> 01:13:41,187
You are being hanously bamboozled by these
lick spittled toves you surround yourself with

677
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,346
What is that?

678
01:13:47,347 --> 01:13:51,461
- I'm not the only one Majesty. Look.
- Look. A
 counterfeit nose. You should be ashamed!

679
01:13:51,462 --> 01:13:55,006
Me? What About that big belly
you're so proud off?

680
01:14:59,200 --> 01:14:00,690
Liars!

681
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:02,500
Cheats!

682
01:14:03,003 --> 01:14:06,989
Off with their heads!

683
01:14:11,943 --> 01:14:15,144
The Abused and enslaved
in the Red Queen's court!

684
01:14:15,145 --> 01:14:18,070
All of you, stand up and fight!

685
01:14:18,071 --> 01:14:21,795
Rise up against the Bloody Red Queen!

686
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:26,805
Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!

687
01:14:33,772 --> 01:14:35,812
Release the Jubjub bird!

688
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:04,500
You were right, Stayne.
It is far better to be feared than loved.

689
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,001
Come with me! Quickly, come on!

690
01:15:15,224 --> 01:15:17,436
- Hatter!
- Come on, Melly, quickly! Come on. Come on!

691
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:22,452
Prepare the Jabberwocky for battle.

692
01:15:22,453 --> 01:15:25,434
We're going to visit
my little sister.

693
01:15:35,602 --> 01:15:38,413
I had hope to have a champion by now

694
01:15:40,782 --> 01:15:43,130
Why don't you slay the
Jabberwocky yourself?

695
01:15:43,131 --> 01:15:44,826
You must have the power.

696
01:15:44,827 --> 01:15:48,127
It is against my vows to harm
any living creature.

697
01:15:57,388 --> 01:15:58,965
We have company.

698
01:16:08,959 --> 01:16:10,812
Have a look, Bayard.

699
01:16:23,193 --> 01:16:26,330
- So happy to see you, I thought they were going to...
- Send me to die, but they didn't.

700
01:16:26,331 --> 01:16:28,514
And here I am, still in one piece!

701
01:16:28,515 --> 01:16:31,175
I'd rather have died than
never seeing you again

702
01:16:31,176 --> 01:16:36,032
I would've regret not seeing you again
especially now that you're you,

703
01:16:36,033 --> 01:16:39,799
in the proper size. It's a good size, it's a great
size, it's the right size, it's..

704
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:41,410
Hatter.

705
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,092
Where's your hat.

706
01:16:51,157 --> 01:16:53,511
- Cheshire.
- How's the arm, love?

707
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:59,051
- All healed.
- Goodbye, sweet hat

708
01:17:18,230 --> 01:17:22,455
Have you any idea why a raven is
like a writing desk?

709
01:17:25,176 --> 01:17:27,123
Let me think about it.

710
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:31,244
You know what tomorrow is, don't you?

711
01:17:34,598 --> 01:17:37,105
Frabjus Day, how I could forget?

712
01:17:37,106 --> 01:17:39,897
I wish I'd wake up.

713
01:17:41,548 --> 01:17:44,198
You still believe this is
a dream, do you?

714
01:17:44,199 --> 01:17:45,819
Of course

715
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:48,862
This has all come from my own mind.

716
01:17:51,505 --> 01:17:55,426
Which would mean that I'm not real.

717
01:17:58,704 --> 01:18:00,500
Afraid so.

718
01:18:00,501 --> 01:18:03,679
You're just a figment of my
imagination

719
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:07,080
I would dream up someone who's half mad

720
01:18:07,081 --> 01:18:12,156
Yes, yes. But you would have to be'
half mad to dream me up.

721
01:18:15,301 --> 01:18:16,869
I must be then.

722
01:18:21,916 --> 01:18:24,081
I'll miss you when I wake up.

723
01:18:39,171 --> 01:18:43,220
Who will step forth to be
champion for the White Queen?

724
01:18:43,221 --> 01:18:46,678
That would be I

725
01:18:48,309 --> 01:18:51,403
You have very poor evaporating skills

726
01:18:51,404 --> 01:18:53,058
I should be the one.

727
01:18:53,059 --> 01:18:54,525
I'll do it

728
01:18:54,926 --> 01:18:56,437
No, me.

729
01:18:56,938 --> 01:18:58,800
No, me!

730
01:19:16,097 --> 01:19:20,646
No other slayer, no how
If it ain't Alice, it ain't dead

731
01:19:26,755 --> 01:19:28,173
Alice ...

732
01:19:29,489 --> 01:19:31,377
You cannot live your life
to please others,

733
01:19:31,378 --> 01:19:34,721
The choice must be yours.

734
01:19:34,722 --> 01:19:38,028
Because when you step out to face that creature,

735
01:19:39,653 --> 01:19:41,643
you will step out alone

736
01:20:15,939 --> 01:20:19,704
Nothing was ever accomplished with tears

737
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,067
Absolem?

738
01:20:23,549 --> 01:20:25,403
Why are you upside down?

739
01:20:25,404 --> 01:20:28,167
I've come to the end of this life.

740
01:20:28,168 --> 01:20:30,249
You're going to die?

741
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:32,379
Transform.

742
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:36,011
Don't go. I need your
help, I don't know what to do.

743
01:20:36,012 --> 01:20:39,785
I can't help you if you don't even know
who you are, stupid girl.

744
01:20:39,786 --> 01:20:41,611
I'm not stupid!

745
01:20:41,612 --> 01:20:44,522
My name is Alice,
I live in London.

746
01:20:44,523 --> 01:20:47,349
I have a mother named Helen
and a sister named Margaret.

747
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:49,846
My father was Charles Kingsley.

748
01:20:49,847 --> 01:20:53,425
He had a vision that stretched halfway around
the world and nothing ever stopped him

749
01:20:53,426 --> 01:20:55,849
I'm his daughter.

750
01:20:55,850 --> 01:20:57,498
I'm Alice Kingsley.

751
01:20:57,801 --> 01:21:01,295
Alice ... At last!

752
01:21:01,296 --> 01:21:03,634
You are just as dimwitted as
the first time you were here

753
01:21:03,635 --> 01:21:06,324
You called it Wonderland, as I recall

754
01:21:09,347 --> 01:21:11,249
Wonderland.

755
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:15,643
- What do you call yourself?
- Alice.

756
01:21:15,644 --> 01:21:17,501
THE Alice?

757
01:21:17,502 --> 01:21:21,316
I'll take you to the Hare
and the Hatter.

758
01:21:21,317 --> 01:21:23,017
She's the right one,
I'm certain of it.

759
01:21:23,110 --> 01:21:26,432
Look at the table.
Please, have some tea.

760
01:21:28,382 --> 01:21:31,739
Stupid Girl.
- And what is this?

761
01:21:34,806 --> 01:21:39,013
You would think she would
remember all this from the first time.

762
01:21:40,575 --> 01:21:43,725
It wasn't a dream at all.
It was a memory.

763
01:21:43,726 --> 01:21:45,970
This place is real!

764
01:21:45,971 --> 01:21:48,311
So are you and so is the Hatter!

765
01:21:48,312 --> 01:21:51,427
And the Jabberwocky

766
01:21:51,428 --> 01:21:55,115
Remember, the Vorpal Sword knows
what it wants

767
01:21:55,116 --> 01:21:58,679
All you have to do, is hold on to it.

768
01:22:00,654 --> 01:22:06,737
Farewell, Alice.
Perhaps I will see you in another life.

769
01:24:05,978 --> 01:24:07,576
Hello, Iracebeth.

770
01:24:07,577 --> 01:24:10,441
Hello ... Mirana

771
01:24:13,762 --> 01:24:16,337
On this, the Frabjus day,

772
01:24:16,338 --> 01:24:20,683
The Queens, Red and White shall
send forth their champions

773
01:24:20,684 --> 01:24:23,663
to do battle on their behalf.

774
01:24:23,664 --> 01:24:28,758
Iracy, we don't have to fight

775
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:32,739
I know what you're doing.

776
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:35,845
You think you can blink
those pretty little eyes

777
01:24:35,846 --> 01:24:39,032
and I'll melt, just like
mommy and daddy did.

778
01:24:41,374 --> 01:24:43,466
Please.

779
01:24:43,167 --> 01:24:44,513
No!

780
01:24:44,814 --> 01:24:49,177
It's my crown!
I am the eldest!

781
01:24:49,178 --> 01:24:51,671
Jabberwocky!

782
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:40,466
This is impossible.

783
01:25:40,467 --> 01:25:43,349
Only if you believe it is

784
01:25:49,145 --> 01:25:54,271
"Sometimes I believe as many as six
impossible things before breakfast. "

785
01:25:55,195 --> 01:25:57,583
That is an excellent practice

786
01:25:59,522 --> 01:26:06,740
However, just at the moment,
you really might want to focus on the Jabberwocky

787
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:15,317
Where's your champion, sister?

788
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:17,500
Here.

789
01:26:20,202 --> 01:26:22,239
Hello, Um.

790
01:26:35,705 --> 01:26:38,948
Six impossible things.
Count them, Alice.

791
01:26:43,315 --> 01:26:46,258
One. There's a potion that
can make you shrink

792
01:26:50,018 --> 01:26:53,132
Two. A cake that can make you grow.

793
01:26:53,133 --> 01:26:56,213
So, my old foe

794
01:26:56,214 --> 01:26:59,722
We meet on the battlefield, once again

795
01:27:01,035 --> 01:27:04,654
- We've never met.
- Not you, insignificant bearer.

796
01:27:05,719 --> 01:27:10,646
My ancient enemy, the Vorpal one

797
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:12,927
That's enough chatter!

798
01:27:20,696 --> 01:27:23,592
Three. Animals can talk.

799
01:27:28,993 --> 01:27:31,705
Four, Alice...

800
01:27:32,808 --> 01:27:34,516
Cats can disappear.

801
01:27:38,486 --> 01:27:39,872
Five.

802
01:27:41,219 --> 01:27:43,205
There's a place called
Wonderland

803
01:27:44,302 --> 01:27:45,431
Six.

804
01:27:46,445 --> 01:27:48,867
I can slay the Jabberwocky

805
01:28:13,975 --> 01:28:16,660
The Hatter is interfering !
Off with his head!

806
01:30:43,650 --> 01:30:45,400
Off with your head!

807
01:31:18,089 --> 01:31:20,052
Kill her!

808
01:31:20,053 --> 01:31:22,956
We follow you no more,
Bloody Big Head!

809
01:31:22,957 --> 01:31:24,262
How dare you?

810
01:31:24,263 --> 01:31:26,069
Off with his head!

811
01:32:07,354 --> 01:32:09,408
Iracebeth of Crims,

812
01:32:09,409 --> 01:32:12,652
your crimes against Underland
are worthy of death

813
01:32:14,986 --> 01:32:16,280
However,

814
01:32:16,281 --> 01:32:19,279
that is against my vows.

815
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:22,121
Therefore you will be banished
to the Outlands

816
01:32:22,122 --> 01:32:26,514
No one is to show you any kindness
or ever speak a word to you.

817
01:32:29,586 --> 01:32:32,127
You will not have a friend in
the world ...

818
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:38,705
Majesty, I hope you bare on me no
ill will

819
01:32:41,992 --> 01:32:44,512
Iracy won't be alone Stayne

820
01:32:44,513 --> 01:32:46,709
you are to join Iracebeth in banishment

821
01:32:46,710 --> 01:32:49,111
from this day on, until the end of Underland.

822
01:32:52,361 --> 01:32:54,796
Even we have each other.

823
01:33:07,763 --> 01:33:12,066
Majesty, please, kill me!
Please!

824
01:33:12,067 --> 01:33:15,117
But I do not owe you kindness

825
01:33:15,118 --> 01:33:17,859
- Take off my head!
- You tried to kill me?

826
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:20,818
- Majesty!
- He tried to kill me!
-Please!

827
01:33:20,819 --> 01:33:22,941
He tried to kill me!

828
01:33:22,942 --> 01:33:26,582
O Frabjus Day!

829
01:33:33,502 --> 01:33:36,765
- What is he doing?
- Futterwacken.

830
01:34:23,058 --> 01:34:24,945
The blood of the Jabberwocky.

831
01:34:24,946 --> 01:34:28,162
You have our everlasting gratitude.

832
01:34:28,163 --> 01:34:31,838
And for your efforts
on our behalf ...

833
01:34:34,940 --> 01:34:38,353
- Will this take me home?
- If that is what you choose.

834
01:35:04,555 --> 01:35:06,598
You could stay.

835
01:35:09,719 --> 01:35:13,918
What an idea?
A crazy mad wonderful idea!

836
01:35:19,562 --> 01:35:21,348
But I can't

837
01:35:21,349 --> 01:35:24,909
There are questions I have to answer

838
01:35:24,910 --> 01:35:26,919
Things I have to do.

839
01:35:35,169 --> 01:35:38,079
I'll be back again, before you know it

840
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:41,247
You won't remember me.

841
01:35:41,248 --> 01:35:45,161
Of course I will.
How could I forget?

842
01:35:49,265 --> 01:35:53,985
Hatter, why IS a raven
like a writing desk?

843
01:35:53,986 --> 01:35:58,545
I haven't the slightest idea

844
01:36:03,008 --> 01:36:05,029
Fairfarren Alice.

845
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:54,846
She left me standing there
without an answer

846
01:36:54,847 --> 01:36:57,118
A case of nerves, no doubt

847
01:37:00,112 --> 01:37:02,548
- Alice.
- God, lord!

848
01:37:02,549 --> 01:37:05,528
- Are you alright?
- What happened to you?

849
01:37:05,529 --> 01:37:08,041
I fell down a hole
and hit my head.

850
01:37:08,042 --> 01:37:11,688
I'm sorry, Hamish,
I can't marry you.

851
01:37:11,689 --> 01:37:14,003
You're not the right man for me.

852
01:37:14,004 --> 01:37:17,469
You'll always have trouble with your digestion.

853
01:37:17,470 --> 01:37:21,432
I love you, Margaret,
but this is my life.

854
01:37:21,433 --> 01:37:24,340
I'll decide what to do with it.

855
01:37:26,826 --> 01:37:29,880
You're lucky to have my sister for
your wife, Lowell.

856
01:37:29,881 --> 01:37:34,659
I know you'll be good to her.
I'll be watching very closely.

857
01:37:36,610 --> 01:37:39,178
There is no prince, Aunt Imogen

858
01:37:39,179 --> 01:37:42,503
You need to talk to somebody
about these delusions

859
01:37:44,474 --> 01:37:47,871
I happen to love rabbits,
especially white ones.

860
01:37:50,870 --> 01:37:54,825
Don't worry, Mother.
I'll find something useful to do with my life.

861
01:37:57,368 --> 01:38:00,584
You two remind me of some funny boys
I met in a dream

862
01:38:03,184 --> 01:38:06,223
- You've left me out.
- No, I haven't, sir.

863
01:38:06,224 --> 01:38:09,089
You and I have business to discuss

864
01:38:09,090 --> 01:38:12,190
Shall we speak... in the study

865
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,800
Oh, and one more thing.

866
01:38:29,030 --> 01:38:33,058
My father told me he wanted to expand
his trade routes to Sumatra and Borneo

867
01:38:33,059 --> 01:38:35,895
But I don't think he was looking
far enough.

868
01:38:35,896 --> 01:38:38,690
Why not go all the way to China?

869
01:38:38,691 --> 01:38:41,894
It's vast, the culture's rich

870
01:38:41,895 --> 01:38:43,795
and we have a foothole in Hong Kong.

871
01:38:43,895 --> 01:38:47,989
To be the first to trade with China,
Can you imagine it?
