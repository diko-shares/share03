00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.570

2
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.570

3
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.570
<font color="#787878">These are dark times, 
there is no denying.</font>

4
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.570
<font color="#787878">Our world has, perhaps,
faced no greater threat than it does today.</font>

5
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.570
<font color="#787878">But I say this to our citizenry:</font>

6
00:00:52.604 --> 00:00:56.506
<font color="#787878">We, ever your servants....</font>

7
00:00:56.675 --> 00:00:59.337
<font color="#787878">....will continue to defend your liberty....</font>

8
00:00:59.511 --> 00:01:03.845
<font color="#787878">....and repel the forces
that seek to take it from you.</font>

9
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.317
<font color="#787878">Your Ministry remains....</font>

10
00:01:10.855 --> 00:01:12.823
<font color="#787878">....strong.</font>

11
00:01:30.175 --> 00:01:32.370
<font color="#787878">Hermione. Tea's ready, darling.</font>

12
00:01:32.544 --> 00:01:34.478
<font color="#787878">Coming, Mom.</font>

13
00:01:38.416 --> 00:01:40.316
<font color="#787878">Come on, Dudley, hurry up.</font>

14
00:01:40.485 --> 00:01:43.511
<font color="#787878">I still don't understand
why we have to leave.</font>

15
00:01:43.688 --> 00:01:48.455
<font color="#787878">Because, unh,
it's not safe for us here anymore.</font>

16
00:02:03.842 --> 00:02:08.211
<font color="#787878">Ron, tell your father
supper's nearly ready.</font>

17
00:02:13.218 --> 00:02:14.947
<font color="#787878">Is this in Australia?</font>

18
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.088
<font color="#787878">Looks wonderful, doesn't it?</font>

19
00:02:17.255 --> 00:02:22.124
<font color="#787878">Three and a half thousand
kilometers along Australia's east coast.</font>

20
00:02:23.428 --> 00:02:24.952
<font color="#787878">Obliviate.</font>

21
00:04:39.297 --> 00:04:40.958
<font color="#787878">Severus.</font>

22
00:04:41.132 --> 00:04:44.499
<font color="#787878">I was beginning to worry
you had lost your way.</font>

23
00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.127
<font color="#787878">Come, we've saved you a seat.</font>

24
00:04:52.577 --> 00:04:53.908
<font color="#787878">You bring news, I trust?</font>

25
00:04:54.078 --> 00:04:57.741
<font color="#787878">It will happen Saturday next, at nightfall.</font>

26
00:04:57.916 --> 00:05:00.282
<font color="#787878">I've heard differently, my Lord.</font>

27
00:05:00.451 --> 00:05:03.579
<font color="#787878">Dawlish, the Auror,
has let slip that the Potter boy....</font>

28
00:05:03.755 --> 00:05:06.849
<font color="#787878">....will not be moved
until the 30th of this month.</font>

29
00:05:07.292 --> 00:05:08.554
<font color="#787878">The day before he turns 17.</font>

30
00:05:08.726 --> 00:05:11.957
<font color="#787878">This is a false trail.</font>

31
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.794
<font color="#787878">The Auror Office no longer plays any part in the protection of Harry Potter.</font>

32
00:05:16.968 --> 00:05:21.337
<font color="#787878">Those closest to him believe we have infiltrated the Ministry.</font>

33
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.532
<font color="#787878">Well, they got that right, haven't they?</font>

34
00:05:28.012 --> 00:05:30.480
<font color="#787878">What say you, Pius?</font>

35
00:05:34.018 --> 00:05:36.612
<font color="#787878">One hears many things, my Lord.</font>

36
00:05:36.788 --> 00:05:39.348
<font color="#787878">Whether the truth is among them is not clear.</font>

37
00:05:39.524 --> 00:05:42.891
<font color="#787878">Heh. Spoken like a true politician.</font>

38
00:05:43.061 --> 00:05:46.121
<font color="#787878">You will, I think,
prove most useful, Pius.</font>

39
00:05:49.734 --> 00:05:52.965
<font color="#787878">~ Where will he be taken, the boy?
~ To a safe house.</font>

40
00:05:53.371 --> 00:05:55.999
<font color="#787878">Most likely the home of someone in the Order.</font>

41
00:05:56.174 --> 00:05:59.405
<font color="#787878">I'm told it's been given
every manner of protection possible.</font>

42
00:05:59.577 --> 00:06:03.172
<font color="#787878">Once there,
it will be impractical to attack him.</font>

43
00:06:03.348 --> 00:06:08.285
<font color="#787878">Ahem. My Lord.
I'd like to volunteer myself for this task.</font>

44
00:06:08.453 --> 00:06:09.442
<font color="#787878">I want to kill the boy.</font>

45
00:06:10.788 --> 00:06:12.016
<font color="#787878">Wormtail!</font>

46
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.159
<font color="#787878">Have I not spoken to you
about keeping our guest quiet?</font>

47
00:06:15.326 --> 00:06:17.226
<font color="#787878">Yes, my Lord.</font>

48
00:06:17.395 --> 00:06:20.057
<font color="#787878">Right away, my Lord.</font>

49
00:06:20.298 --> 00:06:24.792
<font color="#787878">As inspiring
as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix....</font>

50
00:06:25.236 --> 00:06:28.535
<font color="#787878">....I must be the one to kill Harry Potter.</font>

51
00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:35.810
<font color="#787878">But I face an unfortunate complication.</font>

52
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:41.179
<font color="#787878">That my wand and Potter's
share the same core.</font>

53
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:48.984
<font color="#787878">They are, in some ways, twins.</font>

54
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.859
<font color="#787878">We can wound,
but not fatally harm one another.</font>

55
00:06:55.466 --> 00:06:58.264
<font color="#787878">If I am to kill him....</font>

56
00:06:58.937 --> 00:07:02.703
<font color="#787878">....I must do it with another's wand.</font>

57
00:07:04.709 --> 00:07:10.409
<font color="#787878">Come,
surely one of you would like the honor?</font>

58
00:07:12.016 --> 00:07:13.677
<font color="#787878">Mm?</font>

59
00:07:15.386 --> 00:07:20.187
<font color="#787878">What about you, Lucius?</font>

60
00:07:22.694 --> 00:07:24.093
<font color="#787878">My Lord?</font>

61
00:07:24.262 --> 00:07:26.230
<font color="#787878">"My Lord?"</font>

62
00:07:27.298 --> 00:07:30.927
<font color="#787878">I require your wand.</font>

63
00:07:44.248 --> 00:07:46.716
<font color="#787878">Do I detect elm?</font>

64
00:07:46.884 --> 00:07:48.852
<font color="#787878">Yes, my Lord.</font>

65
00:07:54.792 --> 00:07:57.727
<font color="#787878">And the core?</font>

66
00:07:57.895 --> 00:08:00.090
<font color="#787878">Dragon. Ahem.</font>

67
00:08:00.264 --> 00:08:01.891
<font color="#787878">Dragon heartstring, my Lord.</font>

68
00:08:02.066 --> 00:08:04.261
<font color="#787878">~ Dragon heartstring.
~ Mm.</font>

69
00:08:19.984 --> 00:08:21.747
<font color="#787878">To those of you who do not know....</font>

70
00:08:21.919 --> 00:08:24.581
<font color="#787878">....we are joined tonight
by Miss Charity Burbage....</font>

71
00:08:24.756 --> 00:08:30.251
<font color="#787878">....who, until recently, taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</font>

72
00:08:30.428 --> 00:08:33.886
<font color="#787878">Her specialty was Muggle Studies.</font>

73
00:08:37.101 --> 00:08:43.370
<font color="#787878">It is Miss Burbage's belief that Muggles are not so different from us.</font>

74
00:08:43.541 --> 00:08:47.170
<font color="#787878">She would, given her way....</font>

75
00:08:47.945 --> 00:08:49.879
<font color="#787878">....have us mate with them.</font>

76
00:08:53.551 --> 00:08:59.751
<font color="#787878">To her, the mixture of magical and Muggle blood is not an abomination....</font>

77
00:08:59.924 --> 00:09:02.950
<font color="#787878">....but something to be encouraged.</font>

78
00:09:04.028 --> 00:09:05.893
<font color="#787878">Severus.</font>

79
00:09:06.064 --> 00:09:08.032
<font color="#787878">Severus, please.</font>

80
00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.861
<font color="#787878">We're friends.</font>

81
00:09:16.641 --> 00:09:18.199
<font color="#787878">Avada Kedavra!</font>

82
00:09:28.453 --> 00:09:30.478
<font color="#787878">Nagini.</font>

83
00:09:34.092 --> 00:09:35.753
<font color="#787878">Dinner.</font>

84
00:11:21.065 --> 00:11:24.466
<font color="#787878">~ Hello, Harry.
~ All right. Wow.</font>

85
00:11:24.635 --> 00:11:25.727
<font color="#787878">Hello.</font>

86
00:11:25.903 --> 00:11:28.804
<font color="#787878">~ You're looking fit.
~ Yeah, he's absolutely gorgeous.</font>

87
00:11:28.973 --> 00:11:31.441
<font color="#787878">What say we get undercover
before someone murders him?</font>

88
00:11:31.609 --> 00:11:32.633
<font color="#787878">Evening.</font>

89
00:11:37.548 --> 00:11:39.948
<font color="#787878">I thought you were
looking after the Prime Minister.</font>

90
00:11:40.117 --> 00:11:42.017
<font color="#787878">You are more important.</font>

91
00:11:42.186 --> 00:11:45.246
<font color="#787878">~ Hello, Harry. Bill Weasley.
~ Oh. Pleasure to meet you.</font>

92
00:11:45.423 --> 00:11:48.415
<font color="#787878">~ He was never always this handsome.
~ Dead ugly.</font>

93
00:11:48.593 --> 00:11:49.992
<font color="#787878">True enough.</font>

94
00:11:50.161 --> 00:11:52.686
<font color="#787878">Owe it all to a werewolf,
name of Greyback.</font>

95
00:11:52.863 --> 00:11:56.230
<font color="#787878">~ Hope to repay the favor one day.
~ You're still beautiful to me, William.</font>

96
00:11:56.601 --> 00:12:00.230
<font color="#787878">Just remember, Fleur,
Bill takes his steaks on the raw side now.</font>

97
00:12:00.404 --> 00:12:02.736
<font color="#787878">My husband, the joker.</font>

98
00:12:02.907 --> 00:12:06.172
<font color="#787878">By the way, wait till you hear the news. Remus and I--</font>

99
00:12:06.344 --> 00:12:08.778
<font color="#787878">All right. We'll have time
for a cozy catch-up later.</font>

100
00:12:08.946 --> 00:12:11.915
<font color="#787878">We've got to get the hell out of here. And soon.</font>

101
00:12:12.583 --> 00:12:15.848
<font color="#787878">Potter, you're underage, which means you've still got the Trace on you.</font>

102
00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.044
<font color="#787878">What's the Trace?</font>

103
00:12:17.221 --> 00:12:19.883
<font color="#787878">If you sneeze, the Ministry will know who wipes your nose.</font>

104
00:12:20.057 --> 00:12:23.220
<font color="#787878">We have to use those means of transport the Trace can't detect:</font>

105
00:12:23.394 --> 00:12:25.726
<font color="#787878">Brooms, Thestrals and the like. We go in pairs.</font>

106
00:12:25.896 --> 00:12:29.662
<font color="#787878">That way, if anyone's out there waiting for us, and I reckon there will be....</font>

107
00:12:29.834 --> 00:12:32.325
<font color="#787878">....they won't know which Harry Potter is the real one.</font>

108
00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:33.930
<font color="#787878">The real one?</font>

109
00:12:35.273 --> 00:12:38.367
<font color="#787878">I believe you're familiar
with this particular brew.</font>

110
00:12:38.542 --> 00:12:40.840
<font color="#787878">No. Absolutely not.</font>

111
00:12:41.012 --> 00:12:42.343
<font color="#787878">I told you he'd take it well.</font>

112
00:12:42.513 --> 00:12:45.641
<font color="#787878">No, if you think I'm gonna let everyone risk their lives for me, I--</font>

113
00:12:45.816 --> 00:12:48.876
<font color="#787878">~ Never done that before, have we?
~ No. No. This is different.</font>

114
00:12:49.053 --> 00:12:51.044
<font color="#787878">I mean, taking that, becoming me. No.</font>

115
00:12:51.222 --> 00:12:53.053
<font color="#787878">Well, none of us really fancy it, mate.</font>

116
00:12:53.224 --> 00:12:57.388
<font color="#787878">Imagine if something went wrong, and we ended up a scrawny, specky git forever.</font>

117
00:12:57.561 --> 00:12:59.222
<font color="#787878">Everyone here is of age, Potter.</font>

118
00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:01.363
<font color="#787878">They've all agreed to take the risk.</font>

119
00:13:02.733 --> 00:13:05.634
<font color="#787878">Technically, I've been coerced.</font>

120
00:13:05.803 --> 00:13:07.998
<font color="#787878">Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter.</font>

121
00:13:08.172 --> 00:13:10.732
<font color="#787878">~ Always been a huge admirer.
~ Nip it, Mundungus.</font>

122
00:13:12.043 --> 00:13:14.534
<font color="#787878">All right, Granger, as discussed.</font>

123
00:13:14.712 --> 00:13:17.442
<font color="#787878">~ Blimey, Hermione.
~ Straight in here, if you please.</font>

124
00:13:27.291 --> 00:13:31.489
<font color="#787878">For those of you who haven't taken Polyjuice Potion before, fair warning:</font>

125
00:13:31.662 --> 00:13:33.289
<font color="#787878">It tastes like goblin piss.</font>

126
00:13:33.464 --> 00:13:36.433
<font color="#787878">Have a lot of experiences with that, do you, Mad-Eye?</font>

127
00:13:37.335 --> 00:13:40.270
<font color="#787878">Just trying to diffuse the tension.</font>

128
00:13:41.305 --> 00:13:43.102
<font color="#787878">Oh.</font>

129
00:13:46.177 --> 00:13:47.940
<font color="#787878">Ugh.</font>

130
00:14:12.203 --> 00:14:14.262
<font color="#787878">Wow, we're identical.</font>

131
00:14:14.438 --> 00:14:15.496
<font color="#787878">Not yet, you're not.</font>

132
00:14:19.176 --> 00:14:21.736
<font color="#787878">Haven't got anything
a bit more sporting, have you?</font>

133
00:14:21.912 --> 00:14:23.379
<font color="#787878">I don't really fancy this color.</font>

134
00:14:23.547 --> 00:14:26.345
<font color="#787878">Well, fancy this, you're not you. So shut it and strip.</font>

135
00:14:26.517 --> 00:14:28.075
<font color="#787878">All right, all right.</font>

136
00:14:28.252 --> 00:14:29.810
<font color="#787878">You'll need to change too, Potter.</font>

137
00:14:30.321 --> 00:14:32.949
<font color="#787878">Bill, look away. I'm hideous.</font>

138
00:14:33.124 --> 00:14:35.422
<font color="#787878">I knew she was lying about that tattoo.</font>

139
00:14:35.593 --> 00:14:38.027
<font color="#787878">Harry, your eyesight really is awful.</font>

140
00:14:38.195 --> 00:14:41.892
<font color="#787878">Right, then. We'll be pairing off. Each Potter will have a protector.</font>

141
00:14:42.066 --> 00:14:45.365
<font color="#787878">Mundungus, stick tight to me. I wanna keep an eye on you.</font>

142
00:14:45.903 --> 00:14:47.734
<font color="#787878">~ As for Harry--
~ Yes?</font>

143
00:14:48.572 --> 00:14:49.971
<font color="#787878">The real Harry.</font>

144
00:14:50.141 --> 00:14:52.507
<font color="#787878">~ Where the devil are you, anyway?
~ Here.</font>

145
00:14:52.676 --> 00:14:54.644
<font color="#787878">You'll ride with Hagrid.</font>

146
00:14:54.812 --> 00:14:59.840
<font color="#787878">I brought you here 16 years ago when you were no bigger than a Bowtruckle.</font>

147
00:15:00.017 --> 00:15:02.918
<font color="#787878">Seems only right that I should be the one to take you away now.</font>

148
00:15:03.087 --> 00:15:06.022
<font color="#787878">Yes, it's all very touching. Let's go.</font>

149
00:15:19.336 --> 00:15:23.238
<font color="#787878">Head for the Burrows.
We'll rendezvous there.</font>

150
00:15:23.774 --> 00:15:25.833
<font color="#787878">On the count of three.</font>

151
00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:27.739
<font color="#787878">Hold tight, Harry.</font>

152
00:15:27.912 --> 00:15:29.709
<font color="#787878">One....</font>

153
00:15:30.581 --> 00:15:32.378
<font color="#787878">....two....</font>

154
00:15:38.789 --> 00:15:40.586
<font color="#787878">....three!</font>

155
00:16:10.588 --> 00:16:13.751
<font color="#787878">~ Which one?
~ Where are you?</font>

156
00:16:14.959 --> 00:16:16.688
<font color="#787878">He's on your right!</font>

157
00:16:16.861 --> 00:16:18.488
<font color="#787878">He's over there!</font>

158
00:16:18.662 --> 00:16:20.323
<font color="#787878">Down!</font>

159
00:16:25.803 --> 00:16:27.464
<font color="#787878">Hagrid, we have to help the others!</font>

160
00:16:27.872 --> 00:16:30.773
<font color="#787878">I can't do that, Harry. Mad-Eye's orders.</font>

161
00:16:37.715 --> 00:16:39.512
<font color="#787878">Hang on.</font>

162
00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.379
<font color="#787878">Stupefy!</font>

163
00:16:59.103 --> 00:17:00.195
<font color="#787878">Hang on, Harry.</font>

164
00:17:10.114 --> 00:17:11.979
<font color="#787878">Hagrid.</font>

165
00:17:29.199 --> 00:17:31.463
<font color="#787878">No. No.</font>

166
00:17:53.557 --> 00:17:55.548
<font color="#787878">Harry.</font>

167
00:19:15.506 --> 00:19:18.566
<font color="#787878">Harry. Hagrid.</font>

168
00:19:19.977 --> 00:19:23.435
<font color="#787878">What happened? Where are the others?</font>

169
00:19:23.614 --> 00:19:24.774
<font color="#787878">Is no one else back?</font>

170
00:19:24.948 --> 00:19:28.509
<font color="#787878">They were on us right from
the start, Molly. We didn't stand a chance.</font>

171
00:19:28.686 --> 00:19:31.849
<font color="#787878">Well, thank goodness
you two are all right.</font>

172
00:19:32.022 --> 00:19:34.582
<font color="#787878">The Death Eaters were
waiting for us. It was an ambush.</font>

173
00:19:34.758 --> 00:19:37.158
<font color="#787878">Ron and Tonks
should've already been back.</font>

174
00:19:37.327 --> 00:19:38.521
<font color="#787878">Dad and Fred as well.</font>

175
00:19:41.465 --> 00:19:43.126
<font color="#787878">Here!</font>

176
00:19:43.767 --> 00:19:47.203
<font color="#787878">Quick. Into the house.</font>

177
00:19:50.874 --> 00:19:52.933
<font color="#787878">Oh, my boy.</font>

178
00:19:55.112 --> 00:19:57.603
<font color="#787878">Oh. Oh.</font>

179
00:19:59.216 --> 00:20:00.513
<font color="#787878">~ Lupin!
~ What are you doing?</font>

180
00:20:03.053 --> 00:20:05.988
<font color="#787878">What creature sat in the corner....</font>

181
00:20:06.156 --> 00:20:09.455
<font color="#787878">....the first time Harry Potter visited my office in Hogwarts?</font>

182
00:20:09.626 --> 00:20:11.253
<font color="#787878">~ Are you mad?
~ What creature?!</font>

183
00:20:11.428 --> 00:20:13.259
<font color="#787878">A Grindylow.</font>

184
00:20:19.603 --> 00:20:21.264
<font color="#787878">We've been betrayed.</font>

185
00:20:21.438 --> 00:20:23.838
<font color="#787878">Voldemort knew
you were being moved tonight.</font>

186
00:20:24.007 --> 00:20:26.908
<font color="#787878">I had to make sure
you weren't an impostor.</font>

187
00:20:34.051 --> 00:20:35.484
<font color="#787878">Wait.</font>

188
00:20:38.489 --> 00:20:43.017
<font color="#787878">The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us?</font>

189
00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:49.197
<font color="#787878">"Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him."</font>

190
00:20:53.737 --> 00:20:54.829
<font color="#787878">What gave you away?</font>

191
00:20:55.005 --> 00:20:58.202
<font color="#787878">Hedwig, I think.
She was trying to protect me.</font>

192
00:21:14.758 --> 00:21:15.918
<font color="#787878">Thanks.</font>

193
00:21:16.093 --> 00:21:18.254
<font color="#787878">Deserves that. Brilliant, he was.</font>

194
00:21:18.428 --> 00:21:21.522
<font color="#787878">~ I wouldn't be standing here without him.
~ Really?</font>

195
00:21:22.533 --> 00:21:25.195
<font color="#787878">Always the tone of surprise.</font>

196
00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:34.604
<font color="#787878">We the last back?</font>

197
00:21:35.913 --> 00:21:36.937
<font color="#787878">Where's George?</font>

198
00:21:58.235 --> 00:22:00.465
<font color="#787878">How you feeling, Georgie?</font>

199
00:22:02.472 --> 00:22:03.996
<font color="#787878">Saint-like.</font>

200
00:22:05.209 --> 00:22:06.437
<font color="#787878">Come again?</font>

201
00:22:07.377 --> 00:22:10.938
<font color="#787878">Saint-like. I'm holy.</font>

202
00:22:11.448 --> 00:22:14.508
<font color="#787878">I'm holey, Fred. Get it?</font>

203
00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:21.019
<font color="#787878">The whole wide world of ear-related humor and you go for "I'm holey."</font>

204
00:22:21.191 --> 00:22:22.351
<font color="#787878">That's pathetic.</font>

205
00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.258
<font color="#787878">Reckon I'm still better-looking than you.</font>

206
00:22:28.799 --> 00:22:30.994
<font color="#787878">Mad-Eye's dead.</font>

207
00:22:41.378 --> 00:22:45.109
<font color="#787878">Mundungus took one look at Voldemort and Disapparated.</font>

208
00:23:08.038 --> 00:23:10.063
<font color="#787878">Head for the Burrows.</font>

209
00:23:10.874 --> 00:23:12.239
<font color="#787878">This is beyond anything I imagined.</font>

210
00:23:12.409 --> 00:23:15.037
<font color="#787878">~ Seven?
~ Seven....? A Horcrux.</font>

211
00:23:15.212 --> 00:23:16.645
<font color="#787878">They could be hidden anywhere.</font>

212
00:23:16.813 --> 00:23:19.008
<font color="#787878">To rip the soul into seven pieces....</font>

213
00:23:19.182 --> 00:23:22.151
<font color="#787878">~ If you did destroy each Horcrux....
~ One destroys Voldemort.</font>

214
00:23:25.756 --> 00:23:27.383
<font color="#787878">Trust me.</font>

215
00:23:28.325 --> 00:23:31.886
<font color="#787878">You lied to me. 
Lied to me, Ollivander.</font>

216
00:24:03.827 --> 00:24:05.761
<font color="#787878">Going somewhere?</font>

217
00:24:09.433 --> 00:24:13.529
<font color="#787878">Nobody else is going to die. Not for me.</font>

218
00:24:13.704 --> 00:24:15.501
<font color="#787878">For you?</font>

219
00:24:15.672 --> 00:24:17.902
<font color="#787878">You think Mad-Eye died for you?</font>

220
00:24:18.075 --> 00:24:21.010
<font color="#787878">You think George took that curse for you?</font>

221
00:24:21.778 --> 00:24:25.714
<font color="#787878">You may be the Chosen One, mate, but this is a whole lot bigger than that.</font>

222
00:24:25.882 --> 00:24:28.407
<font color="#787878">It's always been bigger than that.</font>

223
00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.111
<font color="#787878">~ Come with me.
~ What, and leave Hermione?</font>

224
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:37.822
<font color="#787878">You mad?
We wouldn't last two days without her.</font>

225
00:24:39.229 --> 00:24:40.753
<font color="#787878">Don't tell her I said that.</font>

226
00:24:42.332 --> 00:24:45.529
<font color="#787878">Besides,
you've still got the Trace on you.</font>

227
00:24:45.702 --> 00:24:49.798
<font color="#787878">~ We've still got the wedding--
~ I don't care about a wedding.</font>

228
00:24:49.973 --> 00:24:54.842
<font color="#787878">I'm sorry. No matter whose it is. I have to start finding these Horcruxes.</font>

229
00:24:55.012 --> 00:24:56.980
<font color="#787878">They're our only chance to beat him....</font>

230
00:24:57.147 --> 00:25:00.116
<font color="#787878">....and the longer we stay here, the stronger he gets.</font>

231
00:25:01.551 --> 00:25:03.644
<font color="#787878">Tonight's not the night, mate.</font>

232
00:25:03.954 --> 00:25:06.422
<font color="#787878">We'd only be doing him a favor.</font>

233
00:25:34.184 --> 00:25:36.118
<font color="#787878">Do you think he knows?</font>

234
00:25:36.853 --> 00:25:42.723
<font color="#787878">I mean, they're bits of his soul, these Horcruxes. Bits of him.</font>

235
00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:47.726
<font color="#787878">When Dumbledore destroyed the ring, you destroyed Tom Riddle's diary....</font>

236
00:25:49.232 --> 00:25:51.826
<font color="#787878">....he must have felt something.</font>

237
00:25:52.602 --> 00:25:56.333
<font color="#787878">To kill the other Horcruxes, we have to find them.</font>

238
00:25:56.706 --> 00:25:58.674
<font color="#787878">Where are they?</font>

239
00:25:59.209 --> 00:26:01.268
<font color="#787878">Where do we start?</font>

240
00:26:04.714 --> 00:26:05.806
<font color="#787878">Ready when you are.</font>

241
00:26:07.551 --> 00:26:11.851
<font color="#787878">Please pay attention!
It's your brother's wedding. Buck up.</font>

242
00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.339
<font color="#787878">Zip me up, will you?</font>

243
00:26:53.196 --> 00:26:55.130
<font color="#787878">It seems silly, doesn't it, a wedding?</font>

244
00:26:55.632 --> 00:26:57.998
<font color="#787878">Given everything that's going on.</font>

245
00:26:59.336 --> 00:27:01.395
<font color="#787878">Maybe that's the best reason to have it....</font>

246
00:27:02.005 --> 00:27:04.530
<font color="#787878">....because of everything that's going on.</font>

247
00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:22.751
<font color="#787878">Morning.</font>

248
00:27:32.936 --> 00:27:35.097
<font color="#787878">Come on, keep up.</font>

249
00:27:35.772 --> 00:27:37.433
<font color="#787878">All together now.</font>

250
00:27:37.607 --> 00:27:43.045
<font color="#787878">One, two, three.</font>

251
00:27:53.123 --> 00:27:55.557
<font color="#787878">How's it looking at your end, boys?</font>

252
00:27:56.193 --> 00:27:58.127
<font color="#787878">Brilliant.</font>

253
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:05.065
<font color="#787878">Bloody hell.
What's the Minister of Magic doing here?</font>

254
00:28:10.974 --> 00:28:12.839
<font color="#787878">To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister?</font>

255
00:28:13.009 --> 00:28:17.571
<font color="#787878">I think we both know the answer to that question, Mr. Potter.</font>

256
00:28:25.255 --> 00:28:27.155
<font color="#787878">And this is....?</font>

257
00:28:35.198 --> 00:28:39.100
<font color="#787878">"Herein is set forth
the last will and testament....</font>

258
00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:43.865
<font color="#787878">....of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.</font>

259
00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:48.500
<font color="#787878">First, to Ronald Bilius Weasley....</font>

260
00:28:48.678 --> 00:28:51.977
<font color="#787878">....I leave my Deluminator....</font>

261
00:28:52.148 --> 00:28:54.412
<font color="#787878">....a device of my own making....</font>

262
00:28:54.584 --> 00:28:59.817
<font color="#787878">....in the hope that,
when things seem most dark....</font>

263
00:29:01.458 --> 00:29:04.325
<font color="#787878">....it will show him the light."</font>

264
00:29:10.233 --> 00:29:13.327
<font color="#787878">~ Dumbledore left this for me?
~ Yeah.</font>

265
00:29:14.271 --> 00:29:15.863
<font color="#787878">Brilliant.</font>

266
00:29:16.906 --> 00:29:18.737
<font color="#787878">What is it?</font>

267
00:29:30.887 --> 00:29:32.479
<font color="#787878">Wicked.</font>

268
00:29:34.791 --> 00:29:37.760
<font color="#787878">"To Hermione Jean Granger....</font>

269
00:29:37.927 --> 00:29:43.092
<font color="#787878">....I leave my copy of
The Tales of Beedle the Bard....</font>

270
00:29:43.266 --> 00:29:47.930
<font color="#787878">....in the hope that she find it entertaining and instructive."</font>

271
00:29:48.738 --> 00:29:50.069
<font color="#787878">Mom used to read me those.</font>

272
00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:52.464
<font color="#787878">"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot."</font>

273

<font color="#787878">"Babbitty Rabbitty
and the Cackling Stump."</font>

274
00:29:57.347 --> 00:30:00.714
<font color="#787878">Come on, Babbitty Rabbitty.</font>

275
00:30:01.184 --> 00:30:02.879
<font color="#787878">No?</font>

276
00:30:03.219 --> 00:30:06.017
<font color="#787878">"To Harry James Potter....</font>

277
00:30:06.556 --> 00:30:10.287
<font color="#787878">....I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts....</font>

278
00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:15.488
<font color="#787878">....as a reminder
of the rewards of perseverance....</font>

279
00:30:17.734 --> 00:30:19.929
<font color="#787878">....and skill."</font>

280
00:30:39.989 --> 00:30:43.049
<font color="#787878">~ Is that it, then?
~ Not quite.</font>

281
00:30:43.226 --> 00:30:48.630
<font color="#787878">Dumbledore left you a second bequest:</font>

282
00:30:48.865 --> 00:30:51.857
<font color="#787878">The sword of Godric Gryffindor.</font>

283
00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:58.066
<font color="#787878">Unfortunately, the sword of Gryffindor was not Dumbledore's to give away.</font>

284
00:30:58.475 --> 00:31:01.205
<font color="#787878">As an important historical artifact, it belongs--</font>

285
00:31:01.378 --> 00:31:02.470
<font color="#787878">To Harry.</font>

286
00:31:03.313 --> 00:31:05.247
<font color="#787878">It belongs to Harry.</font>

287
00:31:05.415 --> 00:31:08.111
<font color="#787878">It came to him when he needed it in the Chamber of Secrets.</font>

288
00:31:08.284 --> 00:31:11.185
<font color="#787878">The sword may present itself to any worthy Gryffindor.</font>

289
00:31:11.354 --> 00:31:13.686
<font color="#787878">That does not make it
that wizard's property.</font>

290
00:31:15.125 --> 00:31:18.754
<font color="#787878">And, in any event, the current whereabouts of the sword are unknown.</font>

291
00:31:18.928 --> 00:31:21.522
<font color="#787878">~ Excuse me?
~ The sword is missing.</font>

292
00:31:22.899 --> 00:31:26.426
<font color="#787878">I don't know what you're up to, Mr. Potter....</font>

293
00:31:26.603 --> 00:31:30.562
<font color="#787878">....but you can't fight this war on your own.</font>

294
00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:33.140
<font color="#787878">He's too strong.</font>

295
00:32:34.337 --> 00:32:35.599
<font color="#787878">Hello, Harry.</font>

296
00:32:36.506 --> 00:32:40.499
<font color="#787878">I've interrupted a deep thought, haven't I? I can see it growing smaller in your eyes.</font>

297
00:32:40.677 --> 00:32:42.201
<font color="#787878">Of course not. How are you, Luna?</font>

298
00:32:42.378 --> 00:32:45.006
<font color="#787878">Very well. Got bitten by a garden gnome only moments ago.</font>

299
00:32:45.181 --> 00:32:47.513
<font color="#787878">Gnome saliva is very beneficial.</font>

300
00:32:47.684 --> 00:32:50.050
<font color="#787878">Xenophilius Lovegood.
We live just over the hill.</font>

301
00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:51.414
<font color="#787878">Pleasure to meet you, sir.</font>

302
00:32:51.588 --> 00:32:54.352
<font color="#787878">I trust you know, Mr. Potter, that we at The Quibbler....</font>

303
00:32:54.524 --> 00:32:56.856
<font color="#787878">....unlike those toadies
at The Daily Prophet....</font>

304
00:32:57.026 --> 00:32:59.620
<font color="#787878">....fully supported Dumbledore in his lifetime....</font>

305
00:32:59.796 --> 00:33:03.459
<font color="#787878">....and, in his death,
support you just as fully.</font>

306
00:33:03.766 --> 00:33:05.131
<font color="#787878">Thank you.</font>

307
00:33:05.301 --> 00:33:08.134
<font color="#787878">Come, Daddy.
Harry doesn't want to talk to us right now.</font>

308
00:33:08.304 --> 00:33:10.602
<font color="#787878">He's just too polite to say so.</font>

309
00:33:10.773 --> 00:33:12.832
<font color="#787878">Harry Potter.</font>

310
00:33:16.379 --> 00:33:18.506
<font color="#787878">Excuse me, sir? May I sit down?</font>

311
00:33:18.681 --> 00:33:22.082
<font color="#787878">Mr. Potter. By all means. Here.</font>

312
00:33:22.252 --> 00:33:23.913
<font color="#787878">Thanks.</font>

313
00:33:26.623 --> 00:33:29.922
<font color="#787878">I found what you wrote
in The Daily Prophet really moving.</font>

314
00:33:30.493 --> 00:33:33.291
<font color="#787878">You obviously knew Dumbledore well.</font>

315
00:33:33.463 --> 00:33:36.398
<font color="#787878">Well, I certainly knew him the longest.</font>

316
00:33:36.566 --> 00:33:39.296
<font color="#787878">That is, if you don't count his brother, Aberforth....</font>

317
00:33:39.469 --> 00:33:42.495
<font color="#787878">....and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth.</font>

318
00:33:42.839 --> 00:33:44.898
<font color="#787878">~ I didn't even know he had a brother.
~ Ah.</font>

319
00:33:45.074 --> 00:33:48.635
<font color="#787878">Well, Dumbledore was always very private, even as a boy.</font>

320
00:33:48.811 --> 00:33:50.210
<font color="#787878">Don't despair, Elphias.</font>

321
00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:54.817
<font color="#787878">I'm told he's been thoroughly unriddled by Rita Skeeter....</font>

322
00:33:54.984 --> 00:33:57.817
<font color="#787878">....in 800 pages, no less.</font>

323
00:33:58.454 --> 00:34:02.857
<font color="#787878">Word has it that someone talked to her.</font>

324
00:34:03.026 --> 00:34:05.824
<font color="#787878">Someone who knew
the Dumbledore family well.</font>

325
00:34:06.229 --> 00:34:09.824
<font color="#787878">Both you and I know who that is, Elphias.</font>

326
00:34:09.999 --> 00:34:11.466
<font color="#787878">A monstrous betrayal.</font>

327
00:34:13.369 --> 00:34:14.961
<font color="#787878">Who are we talking about?</font>

328
00:34:16.439 --> 00:34:18.566
<font color="#787878">Bathilda Bagshot.</font>

329
00:34:20.243 --> 00:34:21.301
<font color="#787878">~ Who?
~ My God, boy....</font>

330
00:34:21.477 --> 00:34:26.244
<font color="#787878">....she's only the most celebrated magical historian of the last century.</font>

331
00:34:27.951 --> 00:34:32.183
<font color="#787878">She was as close
to the Dumbledores as anyone.</font>

332
00:34:32.355 --> 00:34:37.383
<font color="#787878">Oh, I'm sure Rita Skeeter thought it well worth a trip to Godric's Hollow....</font>

333
00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.757
<font color="#787878">....to take a peek
into that old bird's rattled cage.</font>

334
00:34:40.930 --> 00:34:42.761
<font color="#787878">Godric's Hollow?</font>

335
00:34:43.199 --> 00:34:45.099
<font color="#787878">Bathilda Bagshot
lives at Godric's Hollow?</font>

336
00:34:45.501 --> 00:34:47.594
<font color="#787878">Well, that's where
she first met Dumbledore.</font>

337
00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:49.635
<font color="#787878">You don't mean to say
he lived there too?</font>

338
00:34:49.806 --> 00:34:53.367
<font color="#787878">The family moved there
after his father killed those three Muggles.</font>

339
00:34:53.543 --> 00:34:57.172
<font color="#787878">Oh, it was quite the scandal.</font>

340
00:34:57.347 --> 00:35:02.182
<font color="#787878">Honestly, my boy,
are you sure you knew him at all?</font>

341
00:35:28.645 --> 00:35:31.739
<font color="#787878">The Ministry has fallen.</font>

342
00:35:32.382 --> 00:35:36.284
<font color="#787878">The Minister of Magic is dead.</font>

343
00:35:38.755 --> 00:35:41.053
<font color="#787878">They are coming.</font>

344
00:35:41.224 --> 00:35:43.317
<font color="#787878">They are coming.</font>

345
00:35:44.594 --> 00:35:46.084
<font color="#787878">They are coming.</font>

346
00:35:46.262 --> 00:35:47.729
<font color="#787878">They're coming!</font>

347
00:35:49.766 --> 00:35:51.597
<font color="#787878">Nice meeting you, Mr. Potter.</font>

348
00:36:02.679 --> 00:36:05.045
<font color="#787878">~ Ginny!
~ Harry! Go!</font>

349
00:36:05.214 --> 00:36:06.272
<font color="#787878">Go!</font>

350
00:36:19.595 --> 00:36:22.189
<font color="#787878">Here you go, sightseeing tour? Leaves in 15 minutes.</font>

351
00:36:23.633 --> 00:36:26.261
<font color="#787878">~ Where are we?
~ Shaftesbury Avenue.</font>

352
00:36:26.436 --> 00:36:29.633
<font color="#787878">I used to come to the theater here with Mom and Dad.</font>

353
00:36:29.939 --> 00:36:33.033
<font color="#787878">I don't know why I thought of it. It just popped into my head.</font>

354
00:36:33.443 --> 00:36:35.274
<font color="#787878">This way.</font>

355
00:36:39.082 --> 00:36:41.175
<font color="#787878">We need to change.</font>

356
00:36:47.123 --> 00:36:48.385
<font color="#787878">How the ruddy....?</font>

357
00:36:48.558 --> 00:36:51.118
<font color="#787878">Undetectable Extension Charm.</font>

358
00:36:51.561 --> 00:36:53.825
<font color="#787878">You're amazing, you are.</font>

359
00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:56.590
<font color="#787878">Always the tone of surprise.</font>

360
00:36:58.601 --> 00:37:00.728
<font color="#787878">Ah. That'll be the books.</font>

361
00:37:06.242 --> 00:37:08.107
<font color="#787878">What about all the people
at the wedding?</font>

362
00:37:08.277 --> 00:37:10.745
<font color="#787878">~ Do you think we should go back?
~ They were after you.</font>

363
00:37:10.913 --> 00:37:13.074
<font color="#787878">We'd put everyone in danger by going back.</font>

364
00:37:14.951 --> 00:37:16.680
<font color="#787878">~ Ron's right.
~ Ahem.</font>

365
00:37:16.853 --> 00:37:18.514
<font color="#787878">Coffee?</font>

366
00:37:19.055 --> 00:37:22.081
<font color="#787878">~ A cappuccino, please.
~ You?</font>

367
00:37:22.925 --> 00:37:26.224
<font color="#787878">~ What she said.
~ Same.</font>

368
00:37:29.599 --> 00:37:33.433
<font color="#787878">So where do we go from here? Leaky Cauldron?</font>

369
00:37:33.803 --> 00:37:34.895
<font color="#787878">It's too dangerous.</font>

370
00:37:35.805 --> 00:37:39.332
<font color="#787878">If Voldemort has taken over the Ministry, none of the old places are safe.</font>

371
00:37:39.509 --> 00:37:42.569
<font color="#787878">Everyone from the wedding
will have gone underground, into hiding.</font>

372
00:37:42.745 --> 00:37:45.236
<font color="#787878">My rucksack with all my things, I've left it at the Burrow.</font>

373
00:37:50.386 --> 00:37:52.286
<font color="#787878">You're joking.</font>

374
00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:57.849
<font color="#787878">I've had all the essentials packed for days, just in case.</font>

375
00:37:58.027 --> 00:38:00.222
<font color="#787878">By the way, these jeans, not my favorite.</font>

376
00:38:01.397 --> 00:38:02.455
<font color="#787878">Down!</font>

377
00:38:03.599 --> 00:38:04.896
<font color="#787878">Stupefy!</font>

378
00:38:09.105 --> 00:38:10.834
<font color="#787878">Expulso!</font>

379
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:22.581
<font color="#787878">Petrificus Totalus.</font>

380
00:38:26.722 --> 00:38:27.780
<font color="#787878">Go.</font>

381
00:38:28.224 --> 00:38:29.384
<font color="#787878">Leave.</font>

382
00:38:34.063 --> 00:38:36.861
<font color="#787878">Lock the door, get the lights.</font>

383
00:38:46.108 --> 00:38:47.837
<font color="#787878">This one's name is Rowle.</font>

384
00:38:48.344 --> 00:38:51.780
<font color="#787878">He was on the Astronomy Tower the night Snape killed Dumbledore.</font>

385
00:38:52.582 --> 00:38:57.076
<font color="#787878">This is Dolohov. I recognize him from the wanted posters.</font>

386
00:38:58.154 --> 00:39:00.315
<font color="#787878">So, what we gonna do with you, hey?</font>

387
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:03.283
<font color="#787878">Kill us if it was turned round, wouldn't you?</font>

388
00:39:03.459 --> 00:39:04.790
<font color="#787878">If we kill them, they'll know we were here.</font>

389
00:39:04.961 --> 00:39:06.360
<font color="#787878">Ron.</font>

390
00:39:06.529 --> 00:39:10.488
<font color="#787878">Suppose he did Mad-Eye.
How would you feel then?</font>

391
00:39:12.468 --> 00:39:14.095
<font color="#787878">It's better we wipe their memories.</font>

392
00:39:14.971 --> 00:39:16.939
<font color="#787878">You're the boss.</font>

393
00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.003
<font color="#787878">Hermione....</font>

394
00:39:21.477 --> 00:39:23.945
<font color="#787878">....you're the best at spells.</font>

395
00:39:41.597 --> 00:39:43.792
<font color="#787878">Obliviate.</font>

396
00:39:56.145 --> 00:39:57.737
<font color="#787878">How is it they knew we were there?</font>

397
00:39:57.914 --> 00:39:59.506
<font color="#787878">Maybe you still have the Trace on you?</font>

398
00:39:59.682 --> 00:40:03.118
<font color="#787878">Can't be. Trace breaks at 17. It's wizarding law.</font>

399
00:40:04.921 --> 00:40:06.479
<font color="#787878">What?</font>

400
00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:10.259
<font color="#787878">We didn't celebrate your birthday, Harry.</font>

401
00:40:10.626 --> 00:40:13.891
<font color="#787878">Ginny and I, we prepared a cake.</font>

402
00:40:14.063 --> 00:40:17.032
<font color="#787878">We were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding.</font>

403
00:40:17.199 --> 00:40:20.635
<font color="#787878">I appreciate the thought, but given the fact that we were almost killed....</font>

404
00:40:20.803 --> 00:40:23.203
<font color="#787878">....by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago....</font>

405
00:40:24.874 --> 00:40:26.569
<font color="#787878">Right.</font>

406
00:40:27.376 --> 00:40:28.400
<font color="#787878">Perspective.</font>

407
00:40:28.577 --> 00:40:31.569
<font color="#787878">We need to get off the streets, get somewhere safe.</font>

408
00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:06.705
<font color="#787878">What was that all about?</font>

409
00:41:07.683 --> 00:41:13.519
<font color="#787878">Probably Mad-Eye's idea,
in case Snape decided to come snooping.</font>

410
00:41:21.697 --> 00:41:23.665
<font color="#787878">Homenum Revelio.</font>

411
00:41:30.306 --> 00:41:32.137
<font color="#787878">We're alone.</font>

412
00:41:38.948 --> 00:41:41.178
<font color="#787878">I believed another wand-</font>

413
00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:43.818
<font color="#787878">You lied to me.
It makes no sense.</font>

414
00:41:46.655 --> 00:41:49.624
<font color="#787878">I believed a different wand would work, I swear.</font>

415
00:41:51.127 --> 00:41:53.186
<font color="#787878">There must be another way.</font>

416
00:43:03.532 --> 00:43:07.263
<font color="#787878">Harry? Hermione, where are you?</font>

417
00:43:07.536 --> 00:43:09.868
<font color="#787878">I think I've found something.</font>

418
00:43:16.178 --> 00:43:17.236
<font color="#787878">Lovely.</font>

419
00:43:22.918 --> 00:43:26.410
<font color="#787878">"Regulus Arcturus Black."</font>

420
00:43:26.589 --> 00:43:28.284
<font color="#787878">R.A.B.</font>

421
00:43:31.894 --> 00:43:35.193
<font color="#787878">"I know I will be dead
long before you read this.</font>

422
00:43:35.364 --> 00:43:39.391
<font color="#787878">I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it."</font>

423
00:43:39.768 --> 00:43:42.168
<font color="#787878">R.A.B. is Sirius's brother.</font>

424
00:43:42.605 --> 00:43:44.368
<font color="#787878">Yes.</font>

425
00:43:46.475 --> 00:43:50.343
<font color="#787878">Question is,
did he actually destroy the real Horcrux?</font>

426
00:44:12.067 --> 00:44:14.228
<font color="#787878">You've been spying on us, have you?</font>

427
00:44:14.403 --> 00:44:18.863
<font color="#787878">Kreacher has been watching.</font>

428
00:44:19.041 --> 00:44:20.975
<font color="#787878">Maybe he knows where the real locket is.</font>

429
00:44:23.979 --> 00:44:25.913
<font color="#787878">Have you ever seen this before?</font>

430
00:44:26.081 --> 00:44:27.673
<font color="#787878">Kreacher?</font>

431
00:44:28.517 --> 00:44:30.951
<font color="#787878">It's Master Regulus' locket.</font>

432
00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:33.816
<font color="#787878">But there were two, weren't there?</font>

433
00:44:34.823 --> 00:44:36.518
<font color="#787878">Where's the other one?</font>

434
00:44:39.028 --> 00:44:43.590
<font color="#787878">Kreacher doesn't know
where the other locket is.</font>

435
00:44:43.766 --> 00:44:46.166
<font color="#787878">Yes, but did you ever see it? Was it in this house?</font>

436
00:44:46.335 --> 00:44:47.495
<font color="#787878">Filthy Mudblood.</font>

437
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:49.365
<font color="#787878">~ Death Eaters are coming--
~ Ron.</font>

438
00:44:49.538 --> 00:44:52.371
<font color="#787878">~ Blood traitor, Weasley.
~ Answer her.</font>

439
00:44:54.143 --> 00:44:56.373
<font color="#787878">Yes.</font>

440
00:44:57.413 --> 00:45:00.871
<font color="#787878">It was here in this house.</font>

441
00:45:02.151 --> 00:45:04.483
<font color="#787878">A most evil object.</font>

442
00:45:04.653 --> 00:45:05.881
<font color="#787878">How do you mean?</font>

443
00:45:06.655 --> 00:45:10.955
<font color="#787878">Before Master Regulus died, he ordered Kreacher to destroy it....</font>

444
00:45:11.126 --> 00:45:16.393
<font color="#787878">....but no matter how hard Kreacher tried, he could not do it.</font>

445
00:45:16.565 --> 00:45:18.157
<font color="#787878">Well, where is it now?</font>

446
00:45:18.801 --> 00:45:23.397
<font color="#787878">~ Did someone take it?
~ He came in the night.</font>

447
00:45:23.572 --> 00:45:28.236
<font color="#787878">He took many things,
including the locket.</font>

448
00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:29.934
<font color="#787878">Who did?</font>

449
00:45:30.613 --> 00:45:32.205
<font color="#787878">Who was it, Kreacher?</font>

450
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:37.412
<font color="#787878">Mundungus.</font>

451
00:45:37.586 --> 00:45:41.078
<font color="#787878">Mundungus Fletcher.</font>

452
00:45:42.157 --> 00:45:43.749
<font color="#787878">Find him.</font>

453
00:46:05.281 --> 00:46:06.748
<font color="#787878">My father will hear about this.</font>

454
00:46:12.054 --> 00:46:13.919
<font color="#787878">Hey, losers.</font>

455
00:46:14.657 --> 00:46:16.921
<font color="#787878">He isn't here.</font>

456
00:46:30.539 --> 00:46:32.939
<font color="#787878">As your new Minister for Magic....</font>

457
00:46:33.142 --> 00:46:38.307
<font color="#787878">....I promise to restore
this temple of tolerance....</font>

458
00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:40.141
<font color="#787878">....to its former glory.</font>

459
00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:43.381
<font color="#787878">Therefore, beginning today....</font>

460
00:46:44.453 --> 00:46:48.219
<font color="#787878">....each employee
will submit themselves....</font>

461
00:46:48.891 --> 00:46:51.121
<font color="#787878">....for evaluation.</font>

462
00:46:51.994 --> 00:46:54.986
<font color="#787878">You have nothing to fear....</font>

463
00:46:56.432 --> 00:46:58.161
<font color="#787878">....if you have nothing to hide.</font>

464
00:47:02.571 --> 00:47:04.163
<font color="#787878">~ How much?
~ Two Galleons.</font>

465
00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:06.831
<font color="#787878">Come on, time is money. Cheers, pal.</font>

466
00:47:07.009 --> 00:47:08.943
<font color="#787878">~ Snatchers!
~ Move out of the way.</font>

467
00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:16.617
<font color="#787878">~ I told you.
~ Get out.</font>

468
00:47:16.785 --> 00:47:17.809
<font color="#787878">Squash him.</font>

469
00:47:27.029 --> 00:47:28.656
<font color="#787878">Be a bit gentler.</font>

470
00:47:54.757 --> 00:47:56.884
<font color="#787878">They have flesh memories.</font>

471
00:47:59.027 --> 00:48:04.556
<font color="#787878">When Scrimgeour first gave it to you, I thought it might open at your touch.</font>

472
00:48:05.401 --> 00:48:08.165
<font color="#787878">That Dumbledore had hidden
something inside it.</font>

473
00:48:08.404 --> 00:48:10.065
<font color="#787878">Many of you are wondering....</font>

474
00:48:10.239 --> 00:48:13.174
<font color="#787878">....why Voldemort has yet to show himself now that he has vanquished....</font>

475
00:48:13.342 --> 00:48:16.402
<font color="#787878">....the most powerful symbol of opposition to him and his followers.</font>

476
00:48:18.447 --> 00:48:19.471
<font color="#787878">Get off.</font>

477
00:48:19.648 --> 00:48:22.412
<font color="#787878">Harry Potter, so long it's been.</font>

478
00:48:22.885 --> 00:48:24.216
<font color="#787878">Get off me.</font>

479
00:48:29.825 --> 00:48:33.761
<font color="#787878">As requested,
Kreacher has returned with the thief....</font>

480
00:48:33.929 --> 00:48:35.920
<font color="#787878">~ Expellliarmus.
~ .... Mundungus Fletcher.</font>

481
00:48:36.098 --> 00:48:39.295
<font color="#787878">What you playing at? Setting a pair of bleeding house-elves after me.</font>

482
00:48:39.468 --> 00:48:40.958
<font color="#787878">Dobby was only trying to help.</font>

483
00:48:41.136 --> 00:48:45.505
<font color="#787878">Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley,
which Dobby thought was curious.</font>

484
00:48:45.674 --> 00:48:50.008
<font color="#787878">And then Dobby heard Kreacher mention Harry Potter's name.</font>

485
00:48:50.179 --> 00:48:53.012
<font color="#787878">~ I just--
~ And then Dobby saw Kreacher....</font>

486
00:48:53.182 --> 00:48:55.980
<font color="#787878">~ ....talking with the thief, Mundungus--
~ I'm no thief.</font>

487
00:48:56.151 --> 00:48:59.086
<font color="#787878">You foul little-- Git.</font>

488
00:48:59.488 --> 00:49:03.891
<font color="#787878">I'm a purveyor
of rare and wondrous objects.</font>

489
00:49:04.059 --> 00:49:05.924
<font color="#787878">You're a thief, Dung. Everyone knows it.</font>

490
00:49:06.094 --> 00:49:09.063
<font color="#787878">Master Weasley,
so good to see you again.</font>

491
00:49:09.231 --> 00:49:10.255
<font color="#787878">Wicked trainers.</font>

492
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.764
<font color="#787878">Listen, I panicked that night, all right?</font>

493
00:49:16.405 --> 00:49:18.635
<font color="#787878">Could I help it
if Mad-Eye fell off his broom?</font>

494
00:49:20.642 --> 00:49:22.075
<font color="#787878">~ You....
~ Tell the truth.</font>

495
00:49:22.244 --> 00:49:25.008
<font color="#787878">When you turned this place over-- Don't deny it.</font>

496
00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:26.704
<font color="#787878">--you found a locket, am I right?</font>

497
00:49:26.882 --> 00:49:29.146
<font color="#787878">Why? Was it valuable?</font>

498
00:49:29.318 --> 00:49:30.444
<font color="#787878">You still got it?</font>

499
00:49:30.619 --> 00:49:33.053
<font color="#787878">No, he's worried
he didn't get enough money for it.</font>

500
00:49:33.222 --> 00:49:34.746
<font color="#787878">Bleeding give it away, didn't I?</font>

501
00:49:36.124 --> 00:49:39.252
<font color="#787878">There I was,
flogging me wares in Diagon Alley....</font>

502
00:49:39.428 --> 00:49:43.387
<font color="#787878">....when some Ministry hag comes up and asks to see me license.</font>

503
00:49:43.632 --> 00:49:45.691
<font color="#787878">Says she's a mind to lock me up.</font>

504
00:49:45.868 --> 00:49:49.531
<font color="#787878">And would've done it too,
if she hadn't taken a fancy to that locket.</font>

505
00:49:49.705 --> 00:49:53.641
<font color="#787878">~ Who was she? The witch. Do you know?
~ No, I--</font>

506
00:49:58.447 --> 00:50:01.848
<font color="#787878">Well, she's there. Look.</font>

507
00:50:03.986 --> 00:50:06.352
<font color="#787878">Bleeding bow and all.</font>

508
00:50:47.195 --> 00:50:50.961
<font color="#787878">Right, remember what we said.</font>

509
00:50:51.233 --> 00:50:54.964
<font color="#787878">Don't speak to anyone
unless absolutely necessary.</font>

510
00:50:55.237 --> 00:51:00.140
<font color="#787878">Just try and act normal.
Do what everybody else is doing.</font>

511
00:51:00.576 --> 00:51:03.704
<font color="#787878">If we do that, then with a bit of luck, we'll get inside.</font>

512
00:51:03.879 --> 00:51:05.471
<font color="#787878">~ And then--
~ It gets really tricky.</font>

513
00:51:05.647 --> 00:51:07.512
<font color="#787878">~ Correct.
~ Yeah.</font>

514
00:51:07.683 --> 00:51:10.584
<font color="#787878">~ This is completely mental.
~ Completely.</font>

515
00:51:10.752 --> 00:51:12.777
<font color="#787878">The world's mental.</font>

516
00:51:12.955 --> 00:51:14.388
<font color="#787878">Come on....</font>

517
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:17.424
<font color="#787878">....we've got a Horcrux to find.</font>

518
00:52:11.313 --> 00:52:13.713
<font color="#787878">We flush ourselves in.</font>

519
00:52:17.753 --> 00:52:20.517
<font color="#787878">That's bloody disgusting.</font>

520
00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:50.211
<font color="#787878">Name?</font>

521
00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:53.044
<font color="#787878">You. Come.</font>

522
00:52:53.221 --> 00:52:55.382
<font color="#787878">~ What? What?
~ Come on.</font>

523
00:52:55.557 --> 00:52:57.991
<font color="#787878">~ What did I do?
~ Just keep walking.</font>

524
00:53:05.367 --> 00:53:07.301
<font color="#787878">~ Are those--?
~ Muggles.</font>

525
00:53:07.469 --> 00:53:12.065
<font color="#787878">In their rightful place.</font>

526
00:53:13.842 --> 00:53:17.039
<font color="#787878">Gotta tell you,
I'm starting to freak out a bit.</font>

527
00:53:19.314 --> 00:53:23.808
<font color="#787878">How long did you say this batch of Polyjuice would last, Hermione?</font>

528
00:53:24.352 --> 00:53:25.376
<font color="#787878">I didn't.</font>

529
00:53:32.561 --> 00:53:34.495
<font color="#787878">Cattermole.</font>

530
00:53:35.530 --> 00:53:39.125
<font color="#787878">It's still raining inside my office. That's two days now.</font>

531
00:53:41.069 --> 00:53:42.832
<font color="#787878">Have you tried an umbrella?</font>

532
00:53:43.805 --> 00:53:46.740
<font color="#787878">You do realize I'm going downstairs, don't you, Cattermole?</font>

533
00:53:47.309 --> 00:53:51.268
<font color="#787878">~ Downstairs?
~ To interrogate your wife.</font>

534
00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:56.116
<font color="#787878">Now, if my wife's blood status were in doubt....</font>

535
00:53:56.284 --> 00:53:59.185
<font color="#787878">....and the head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement....</font>

536
00:53:59.354 --> 00:54:04.917
<font color="#787878">....needed a job doing,
I think I might just make that a priority.</font>

537
00:54:05.494 --> 00:54:07.689
<font color="#787878">You have one hour.</font>

538
00:54:19.441 --> 00:54:25.107
<font color="#787878">Oh, my God. What am I gonna do? My wife's all alone downstairs.</font>

539
00:54:25.413 --> 00:54:29.679
<font color="#787878">~ Ron, you don't have a wife.
~ Oh, right.</font>

540
00:54:29.851 --> 00:54:31.819
<font color="#787878">Level 2.</font>

541
00:54:32.621 --> 00:54:34.748
<font color="#787878">But how do I stop it raining?</font>

542
00:54:34.923 --> 00:54:37.517
<font color="#787878">Try "Finite Incantatem."</font>

543

545
00:54:41.329 --> 00:54:43.297

546
00:54:47.536 --> 00:54:52.371
<font color="#787878">Finite Incantatem. Okay.
And if that doesn't work....?</font>

547

<font color="#787878">Level 1,
Minister of Magic and support staff.</font>

548
00:55:07.389 --> 00:55:09.516
<font color="#787878">If we don't locate Umbridge within the hour....</font>

549
00:55:09.691 --> 00:55:11.682
<font color="#787878">....we go find Ron
and come back another day.</font>

550
00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:12.884
<font color="#787878">~ Deal?
~ Yes.</font>

551
00:55:16.464 --> 00:55:18.796
<font color="#787878">Ah, Mafalda. Travers sent you, did he?</font>

552
00:55:18.967 --> 00:55:22.027
<font color="#787878">Good, we'll go straight down.</font>

553
00:55:24.372 --> 00:55:26.897
<font color="#787878">Albert, aren't you getting out?</font>

554
00:56:00.275 --> 00:56:02.300
<font color="#787878">Runcorn.</font>

555
00:56:54.796 --> 00:56:56.195
<font color="#787878">Accio locket.</font>

556
00:57:50.885 --> 00:57:54.048
<font color="#787878">All right, all right.
Let's calm down, shall we?</font>

557
00:57:54.956 --> 00:57:57.424
<font color="#787878">Let's get back to work, please.</font>

558
00:57:58.226 --> 00:58:00.057
<font color="#787878">Calm down.</font>

559
00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:07.095
<font color="#787878">Runcorn.</font>

560
00:58:14.909 --> 00:58:16.672
<font color="#787878">Morning.</font>

561
00:58:18.380 --> 00:58:20.814
<font color="#787878">Ron, it's me.</font>

562
00:58:20.982 --> 00:58:24.816
<font color="#787878">Harry.
Blimey, forgot what you looked like.</font>

563
00:58:24.986 --> 00:58:26.419
<font color="#787878">Where's Hermione?</font>

564
00:58:26.588 --> 00:58:30.024
<font color="#787878">She's gone down to the courtrooms, with Umbridge.</font>

565
00:58:36.865 --> 00:58:38.992
<font color="#787878">Bloody cold down here.</font>

566
00:58:39.167 --> 00:58:42.762
<font color="#787878">I'm a half-blood. My father was a wizard.</font>

567
00:58:42.937 --> 00:58:45.269
<font color="#787878">William Alderton.
He worked here for 30 years.</font>

568
00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:48.876
<font color="#787878">Perhaps you know him.
Always wore his jacket inside out.</font>

569
00:58:49.044 --> 00:58:51.512
<font color="#787878">No, there's been a mistake. I'm half-blood, you see.</font>

570
00:58:51.679 --> 00:58:54.876
<font color="#787878">We must go back. I'm half-blood.</font>

571
00:59:04.993 --> 00:59:07.086
<font color="#787878">~ Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?
~ Yes.</font>

572
00:59:07.262 --> 00:59:12.199
<font color="#787878">Of 27 Chislehurst Gardens,
Great Tolling, Evesham?</font>

573
00:59:12.367 --> 00:59:13.391
<font color="#787878">~ Yes.
~ It's here.</font>

574
00:59:13.568 --> 00:59:18.369
<font color="#787878">Mother to Maisie, Ellie and Alfred? Wife to Reginald?</font>

575
00:59:22.577 --> 00:59:23.635
<font color="#787878">Reg?</font>

576
00:59:35.223 --> 00:59:37.054
<font color="#787878">Thank you, Albert.</font>

577
00:59:39.661 --> 00:59:42.391
<font color="#787878">Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?</font>

578
00:59:44.599 --> 00:59:45.657
<font color="#787878">Yes.</font>

579
00:59:46.701 --> 00:59:50.228
<font color="#787878">A wand was taken from you
upon your arrival at the Ministry today.</font>

580
00:59:50.405 --> 00:59:53.169
<font color="#787878">Is this that wand?</font>

581
00:59:55.009 --> 00:59:59.537
<font color="#787878">Would you please tell the court from which witch or wizard you took this wand?</font>

582
00:59:59.714 --> 01:00:02.148
<font color="#787878">I didn't take it.</font>

583
01:00:03.384 --> 01:00:09.186
<font color="#787878">I got it in Diagon Alley, at Ollivander's, when I was 11.</font>

584
01:00:10.625 --> 01:00:13.116
<font color="#787878">It chose me.</font>

585
01:00:14.496 --> 01:00:16.259
<font color="#787878">You're lying.</font>

586
01:00:16.698 --> 01:00:21.260
<font color="#787878">Wands only choose witches,
and you are not a witch.</font>

587
01:00:21.436 --> 01:00:23.461
<font color="#787878">But I am.</font>

588
01:00:23.905 --> 01:00:26.965
<font color="#787878">Tell them, Reg. Tell them what I am.</font>

589
01:00:29.511 --> 01:00:30.876
<font color="#787878">Reg, tell them what I am.</font>

590
01:00:40.855 --> 01:00:42.618
<font color="#787878">What on earth are you doing, Albert?</font>

591
01:00:45.527 --> 01:00:47.427
<font color="#787878">You're lying, Dolores.</font>

592
01:00:49.797 --> 01:00:52.357
<font color="#787878">And one mustn't tell lies.</font>

593
01:00:53.168 --> 01:00:54.465
<font color="#787878">Stupefy!</font>

594
01:01:02.177 --> 01:01:03.542
<font color="#787878">It's Harry Potter.</font>

595
01:01:03.711 --> 01:01:06.179
<font color="#787878">It is, isn't it?
This'll be one to tell the kids.</font>

596
01:01:22.197 --> 01:01:23.357
<font color="#787878">Expecto Patronum!</font>

597
01:01:47.222 --> 01:01:49.656
<font color="#787878">Oh. Oh. Oh.</font>

598
01:01:49.824 --> 01:01:51.849
<font color="#787878">Mary, go home.</font>

599
01:01:53.294 --> 01:01:54.761
<font color="#787878">Get the kids.</font>

600
01:01:54.929 --> 01:01:58.296
<font color="#787878">I'll meet you there. We have to get out of the country, understand?</font>

601
01:01:58.466 --> 01:02:00.934
<font color="#787878">Mary, do as I say.</font>

602
01:02:15.350 --> 01:02:16.510
<font color="#787878">Mary?</font>

603
01:02:18.152 --> 01:02:20.052
<font color="#787878">Who's that?</font>

604
01:02:21.189 --> 01:02:24.181
<font color="#787878">Long story. Nice meeting you.</font>

605
01:02:24.359 --> 01:02:25.724
<font color="#787878">It's Harry Potter.</font>

606
01:02:26.427 --> 01:02:28.395
<font color="#787878">It's Harry. Harry Potter.</font>

607
01:02:28.563 --> 01:02:30.588
<font color="#787878">~ There he is.
~ Get him!</font>

608
01:02:30.765 --> 01:02:32.858
<font color="#787878">~ Get him!
~ Stop him!</font>

609
01:02:44.779 --> 01:02:45.939
<font color="#787878">~ Watch out.
~ Look out.</font>

610
01:02:46.314 --> 01:02:47.713
<font color="#787878">This way!</font>

611
01:03:06.701 --> 01:03:08.532
<font color="#787878">Expellliarmus!</font>

612
01:03:55.983 --> 01:03:57.041
<font color="#787878">Oh, my God.</font>

613
01:03:57.218 --> 01:04:00.847
<font color="#787878">Shh, shh, shh. It's all right. It's okay.</font>

614
01:04:03.257 --> 01:04:06.522
<font color="#787878">Harry. Harry, quickly, in my bag.</font>

615
01:04:06.694 --> 01:04:09.219
<font color="#787878">There's a bottle labeled
"Essence of Dittany."</font>

616
01:04:11.799 --> 01:04:14.597
<font color="#787878">Shh. Shh.</font>

617
01:04:14.769 --> 01:04:17.465
<font color="#787878">Okay, okay. Quickly.</font>

618
01:04:18.239 --> 01:04:20.332
<font color="#787878">~ Accio Dittany.
Shh.</font>

619
01:04:20.708 --> 01:04:23.438
<font color="#787878">It's all right. Unstopper it.</font>

620
01:04:23.611 --> 01:04:25.101
<font color="#787878">Hermione, his arm.</font>

621
01:04:25.279 --> 01:04:27.270
<font color="#787878">I know, just do it.</font>

622
01:04:28.015 --> 01:04:29.744
<font color="#787878">It's okay.</font>

623
01:04:31.018 --> 01:04:34.977
<font color="#787878">~ Okay, it's gonna sting a little bit.
~ What happened? I thought we meant....</font>

624
01:04:35.156 --> 01:04:37.886
<font color="#787878">~ ....to be going back to Grimmauld Place.
~ We were. We were. Shh.</font>

625
01:04:38.059 --> 01:04:39.890
<font color="#787878">It's all right. One more, one more.</font>

626
01:04:40.061 --> 01:04:44.589
<font color="#787878">We were there, we were there, but Yaxley had hold of me, and I....</font>

627
01:04:44.766 --> 01:04:47.792
<font color="#787878">I knew once he'd seen where we were, we couldn't stay....</font>

628
01:04:47.969 --> 01:04:51.097
<font color="#787878">....so I brought us here....</font>

629
01:04:51.572 --> 01:04:54.200
<font color="#787878">....but Ron got splinched.</font>

630
01:04:57.278 --> 01:04:59.075
<font color="#787878">It's all right.</font>

631
01:05:18.132 --> 01:05:20.498
<font color="#787878">Protego Totalum.</font>

632
01:05:21.969 --> 01:05:23.436
<font color="#787878">Salvio Hexia.</font>

633
01:05:23.604 --> 01:05:25.003
<font color="#787878">What are you doing?</font>

634
01:05:25.173 --> 01:05:27.471
<font color="#787878">Protective enchantments.</font>

635
01:05:27.642 --> 01:05:31.237
<font color="#787878">I don't fancy another visit like the one we had in Shaftesbury Avenue, do you?</font>

636
01:05:31.412 --> 01:05:33.107
<font color="#787878">You can get going on the tent.</font>

637
01:05:33.781 --> 01:05:35.612
<font color="#787878">~ Tent?
Protego Totalum.</font>

638
01:05:35.783 --> 01:05:37.910
<font color="#787878">Where am I supposed to find a tent?</font>

639
01:05:38.085 --> 01:05:42.385
<font color="#787878">Repello Muggletum. Muffliato.</font>

640
01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:54.600
<font color="#787878">You first.</font>

641
01:05:57.605 --> 01:05:59.698
<font color="#787878">Dissendium.</font>

642
01:06:13.321 --> 01:06:15.221
<font color="#787878">Incendio.</font>

643
01:06:20.628 --> 01:06:22.653
<font color="#787878">Expulso.</font>

644
01:06:29.871 --> 01:06:31.998
<font color="#787878">Diffindo.</font>

645
01:06:33.441 --> 01:06:34.465
<font color="#787878">Reducto.</font>

646
01:06:55.897 --> 01:06:57.762
<font color="#787878">What are you doing?</font>

647
01:06:59.166 --> 01:07:01.930
<font color="#787878">We have to keep it safe
until we find out how to destroy it.</font>

648
01:07:02.103 --> 01:07:04.799
<font color="#787878">Seems strange, mate.
Dumbledore sends you off....</font>

649
01:07:04.972 --> 01:07:08.738
<font color="#787878">....to find all these Horcruxes, but doesn't tell you how to destroy them.</font>

650
01:07:08.910 --> 01:07:10.537
<font color="#787878">Doesn't that bother you?</font>

651
01:07:22.924 --> 01:07:26.325
<font color="#787878">A goblin by 
the name of Gornuk was killed.</font>

652
01:07:26.494 --> 01:07:29.554
<font color="#787878">It is believed that Muggle-born Dean Thomas and a second goblin....</font>

653
01:07:29.730 --> 01:07:32.665
<font color="#787878">....both believed to have been traveling with Tonks, Cresswell....</font>

654
01:07:32.833 --> 01:07:34.357
<font color="#787878">....and Gornuk, may have escaped.</font>

655
01:07:34.535 --> 01:07:38.301
<font color="#787878">If Dean is listening or anyone has any knowledge of his whereabouts....</font>

656
01:07:38.472 --> 01:07:41.532
<font color="#787878">....his parents and sisters are desperate for news.</font>

657
01:07:41.709 --> 01:07:45.076
<font color="#787878">Meanwhile, a Muggle family of five has been found dead in their home.</font>

658
01:07:45.246 --> 01:07:48.511
<font color="#787878">You know the spell, Harry.</font>

659
01:07:52.253 --> 01:07:53.515
<font color="#787878">Tell me.</font>

660
01:07:56.157 --> 01:07:57.988
<font color="#787878">Tell me, Gregorovitch.</font>

661
01:07:58.159 --> 01:07:59.786
<font color="#787878">It was stolen from me.</font>

662
01:07:59.961 --> 01:08:03.419
<font color="#787878">Who was he? The thief?</font>

663
01:08:06.567 --> 01:08:10.526
<font color="#787878">It was a boy. 
It was he who took it.</font>

664
01:08:10.905 --> 01:08:13.203
<font color="#787878">I never saw it again.</font>

665
01:08:13.374 --> 01:08:15.171
<font color="#787878">I swear on my life.</font>

666
01:08:16.043 --> 01:08:17.203
<font color="#787878">I believe you.</font>

667
01:08:23.217 --> 01:08:24.946
<font color="#787878">Avada Kedavra!</font>

668
01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.090
<font color="#787878">I thought it had stopped.</font>

669
01:08:43.004 --> 01:08:45.438
<font color="#787878">You can't keep letting him in, Harry.</font>

670
01:08:47.508 --> 01:08:50.443
<font color="#787878">You-Know-Who has found Gregorovitch.</font>

671
01:08:50.745 --> 01:08:52.303
<font color="#787878">The wandmaker?</font>

672
01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:57.008
<font color="#787878">He wants something
that Gregorovitch used to have....</font>

673
01:08:57.184 --> 01:08:58.651
<font color="#787878">....but I don't know what.</font>

674
01:08:58.819 --> 01:09:04.815
<font color="#787878">But he wants it desperately. I mean, it's as if his life depends on it.</font>

675
01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:07.884
<font color="#787878">Don't.</font>

676
01:09:08.062 --> 01:09:10.257
<font color="#787878">~ It comforts him.
~ It sets my teeth on edge.</font>

677
01:09:10.431 --> 01:09:12.661
<font color="#787878">What's he expecting to hear, good news?</font>

678
01:09:12.833 --> 01:09:15.700
<font color="#787878">~ who long expected it,
the fall of the Ministry was shocking.</font>

679
01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:18.236
<font color="#787878">I think he just hopes
he doesn't hear bad news.</font>

680
01:09:18.406 --> 01:09:20.340
<font color="#787878">We promise
to remain your eyes and ears-</font>

681
01:09:20.508 --> 01:09:21.941
<font color="#787878">How long before he can travel?</font>

682
01:09:22.109 --> 01:09:25.306
<font color="#787878">~ bringing you news when we can, from wherever we can.</font>

683
01:09:25.479 --> 01:09:26.776
<font color="#787878">I'm doing everything I can.</font>

684
01:09:26.947 --> 01:09:28.471
<font color="#787878">You're not doing enough!</font>

685
01:09:31.218 --> 01:09:33.243
<font color="#787878">Take it off.</font>

686
01:09:34.021 --> 01:09:36.581
<font color="#787878">I said, take it off now.</font>

687
01:09:47.601 --> 01:09:50.331
<font color="#787878">~ Better?
~ Loads.</font>

688
01:09:54.041 --> 01:09:56.305
<font color="#787878">We'll take it in turns, okay?</font>

689
01:10:25.372 --> 01:10:28.739
<font color="#787878">Finch does admit
his invention currently has one short.</font>

690
01:10:28.909 --> 01:10:30.376
<font color="#787878">And now, other news:</font>

691
01:10:30.544 --> 01:10:33.809
<font color="#787878">Severus Snape, newly-appointed headmaster of Hogwarts....</font>

692
01:10:33.981 --> 01:10:37.747
<font color="#787878">....has decreed that all students must conform to the latest house rules.</font>

693
01:11:05.379 --> 01:11:09.816
<font color="#787878">Hogwarts bears little resemblance to the school under Dumbledore's leadership.</font>

694
01:11:09.984 --> 01:11:13.613
<font color="#787878">Snape's curriculum is severe, reflecting the wishes of the Dark Lord....</font>

695
01:11:14.455 --> 01:11:19.392
<font color="#787878">....and infractions are dealt with harshly by the two Death Eaters on staff.</font>

696
01:11:38.879 --> 01:11:40.210
<font color="#787878">What's that?</font>

697
01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:52.254
<font color="#787878">What's that smell?</font>

698
01:12:14.715 --> 01:12:16.740
<font color="#787878">~ What you doing?
~ It's heavy.</font>

699
01:12:16.917 --> 01:12:18.509
<font color="#787878">Oh, sorry. Do you want me to carry it?</font>

700
01:12:18.686 --> 01:12:21.621
<font color="#787878">~ Yeah, thank you.
~ Don't be ridiculous. Pick it up.</font>

701
01:12:23.190 --> 01:12:24.214
<font color="#787878">Numpty.</font>

702
01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:31.321
<font color="#787878">Snatchers.</font>

703
01:12:32.366 --> 01:12:34.800
<font color="#787878">Good to know your enchantments work.</font>

704
01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:43.469
<font color="#787878">He could smell it. My perfume.</font>

705
01:12:45.679 --> 01:12:47.738
<font color="#787878">I've told you....</font>

706
01:12:48.215 --> 01:12:50.046
<font color="#787878">....Ron isn't strong enough to Apparate.</font>

707
01:12:50.217 --> 01:12:53.948
<font color="#787878">Well, then, we'll go on foot.</font>

708
01:12:54.755 --> 01:12:59.692
<font color="#787878">And next time, Hermione, as much as I like your perfume, just don't wear any.</font>

709
01:13:04.598 --> 01:13:08.466
<font color="#787878">And now for the names
of missing witches and wizards.</font>

710
01:13:09.336 --> 01:13:11.497
<font color="#787878">These are confirmed.</font>

711
01:13:12.339 --> 01:13:15.706
<font color="#787878">Thankfully, the list is short today.</font>

712
01:13:16.443 --> 01:13:18.502
<font color="#787878">Jason and Alison Denbright.</font>

713
01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:20.404
<font color="#787878">Oh. Thank you.</font>

714
01:13:20.581 --> 01:13:24.312
<font color="#787878">Bella, Jake, Charlie, and Madge Farley.</font>

715
01:13:24.652 --> 01:13:25.676
<font color="#787878">Joe Laurie.</font>

716
01:13:26.987 --> 01:13:29.581
<font color="#787878">Eleanor Sarah Gibbs.</font>

717
01:13:30.758 --> 01:13:34.057
<font color="#787878">Harry and Bronwyn Trigg.</font>

718
01:13:35.696 --> 01:13:38.722
<font color="#787878">Rob and Ellie Dowson.</font>

719
01:13:39.833 --> 01:13:42.358
<font color="#787878">Georgia Clark-Day.</font>

720
01:13:42.937 --> 01:13:45.462
<font color="#787878">Joshua Flexson.</font>

721
01:13:45.873 --> 01:13:47.363
<font color="#787878">George Coutas.</font>

722
01:13:48.509 --> 01:13:51.342
<font color="#787878">Gabriella and Emily Mather.</font>

723
01:13:52.379 --> 01:13:55.473
<font color="#787878">Jacob and Mimi Erland.</font>

724
01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:58.040
<font color="#787878">William and Brian Gallagher.</font>

725
01:13:58.218 --> 01:14:00.652
<font color="#787878">He doesn't know
what he's doing, does he?</font>

726
01:14:03.490 --> 01:14:05.390
<font color="#787878">None of us do.</font>

727
01:14:07.962 --> 01:14:10.726
<font color="#787878">Toby and Olivia Gleaves.</font>

728
01:14:11.598 --> 01:14:14.226
<font color="#787878">Katie and James Killick.</font>

729
01:14:14.401 --> 01:14:16.926
<font color="#787878">Elsie Valentine Schroeder.</font>

730
01:14:17.972 --> 01:14:20.065
<font color="#787878">Jennifer Winston.</font>

01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:23.334
<font color="#787878">Tamsin and lola Hillicker.</font>

732
01:14:24.545 --> 01:14:25.569
<font color="#787878">Scarlet and Kitty Sharp.</font>

733
01:14:44.618 --> 01:14:46.449
<font color="#787878">Oh, my God.</font>

734
01:14:46.821 --> 01:14:48.448
<font color="#787878">What?</font>

735
01:14:49.023 --> 01:14:51.048
<font color="#787878">I'll tell you in a minute.</font>

736
01:14:51.592 --> 01:14:54.288
<font color="#787878">Maybe you could tell me now.</font>

737
01:14:54.662 --> 01:14:57.688
<font color="#787878">The sword of Gryffindor,
it's goblin-made.</font>

738
01:14:57.865 --> 01:14:58.957
<font color="#787878">Brilliant.</font>

739
01:15:00.034 --> 01:15:02.434
<font color="#787878">No, you don't understand.</font>

740
01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:05.136
<font color="#787878">Dirt and rust have no effect on the blade.</font>

741
01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:09.507
<font color="#787878">It only takes in
that which makes it stronger.</font>

742
01:15:09.910 --> 01:15:11.275
<font color="#787878">Okay.</font>

743
01:15:11.445 --> 01:15:14.937
<font color="#787878">Harry, you've already destroyed one Horcrux, right?</font>

744
01:15:15.116 --> 01:15:17.380
<font color="#787878">Tom Riddle's diary
in the Chamber of Secrets.</font>

745
01:15:17.551 --> 01:15:20.452
<font color="#787878">With a Basilisk fang.
If you tell me you've got one of those....</font>

746
01:15:20.621 --> 01:15:24.079
<font color="#787878">~ ....in that bloody beaded bag of yours....
~ Don't you see?</font>

747
01:15:24.258 --> 01:15:27.989
<font color="#787878">In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed the Basilisk with the sword of Gryffindor.</font>

748
01:15:28.162 --> 01:15:31.689
<font color="#787878">Its blade is impregnated
with Basilisk venom.</font>

749
01:15:31.866 --> 01:15:33.959
<font color="#787878">It only takes in
that which makes it stronger.</font>

750
01:15:34.135 --> 01:15:37.298
<font color="#787878">~ Exactly, which is why--
~ It can destroy Horcruxes.</font>

751
01:15:37.471 --> 01:15:39.735
<font color="#787878">That's why Dumbledore left it to you in his will.</font>

752
01:15:39.907 --> 01:15:44.310
<font color="#787878">You are brilliant, Hermione. Truly.</font>

753
01:15:44.478 --> 01:15:48.539
<font color="#787878">Actually, I'm highly logical, which allows me to look past extraneous detail....</font>

754
01:15:48.716 --> 01:15:51.207
<font color="#787878">....and perceive clearly
that which others overlook.</font>

755
01:15:51.385 --> 01:15:54.081
<font color="#787878">Yeah, there's only one problem, of course.</font>

756
01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:01.587
<font color="#787878">The sword was stolen.</font>

757
01:16:02.997 --> 01:16:05.522
<font color="#787878">Yeah, I'm still here.</font>

758
01:16:06.033 --> 01:16:10.163
<font color="#787878">But you two carry on.
Don't let me spoil the fun.</font>

759
01:16:11.539 --> 01:16:15.532
<font color="#787878">~ What's wrong?
~ Wrong? Nothing's wrong.</font>

760
01:16:15.709 --> 01:16:17.609
<font color="#787878">Not according to you, anyway.</font>

761
01:16:17.778 --> 01:16:21.407
<font color="#787878">Look, if you've got something to say, don't be shy. Spit it out.</font>

762
01:16:21.782 --> 01:16:25.081
<font color="#787878">All right, I'll spit it out. But don't expect me to be grateful....</font>

763
01:16:25.252 --> 01:16:27.777
<font color="#787878">....because there's another damn thing we've gotta find.</font>

764
01:16:27.955 --> 01:16:30.219
<font color="#787878">I thought you knew
what you signed up for.</font>

765
01:16:30.724 --> 01:16:32.589
<font color="#787878">Yeah. I thought I did too.</font>

766
01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:35.786
<font color="#787878">Well then, I'm sorry,
but I don't quite understand.</font>

767
01:16:35.963 --> 01:16:39.421
<font color="#787878">What part of this isn't living up to your expectations?</font>

768
01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:41.864
<font color="#787878">Did you think we were gonna be staying in a hotel?</font>

769
01:16:42.036 --> 01:16:45.301
<font color="#787878">Finding a Horcrux every other day? Thought you'd be back by Christmas?</font>

770
01:16:45.472 --> 01:16:47.303
<font color="#787878">I just thought, after all this time....</font>

771
01:16:47.474 --> 01:16:50.910
<font color="#787878">....we would've achieved something. I thought you knew what you were doing.</font>

772
01:16:51.078 --> 01:16:53.478
<font color="#787878">I thought Dumbledore told you something worthwhile.</font>

773
01:16:53.647 --> 01:16:56.844
<font color="#787878">~ I thought you had a plan.
~ I told you everything Dumbledore told me.</font>

774
01:16:57.017 --> 01:16:59.212
<font color="#787878">In case you haven't noticed, we found a Horcrux.</font>

775
01:16:59.386 --> 01:17:03.254
<font color="#787878">Yeah, and we're as close to getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them.</font>

776
01:17:03.424 --> 01:17:06.018
<font color="#787878">Ron. Please, take--</font>

777
01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:08.960
<font color="#787878">Take the Horcrux off.
You wouldn't be saying this....</font>

778
01:17:09.129 --> 01:17:10.460
<font color="#787878">....if you hadn't been wearing it all day.</font>

779
01:17:10.631 --> 01:17:13.031
<font color="#787878">Want to know why I listen to that radio?</font>

780
01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:17.864
<font color="#787878">To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name, or Fred, or George or Mom.</font>

781
01:17:18.038 --> 01:17:21.201
<font color="#787878">You think I'm not listening? You think I don't know how this feels?!</font>

782
01:17:21.375 --> 01:17:22.842
<font color="#787878">No, you don't know how it feels!</font>

783
01:17:23.010 --> 01:17:25.376
<font color="#787878">Your parents are dead.
You have no family.</font>

784
01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:29.210
<font color="#787878">~ Stop. Stop.
~ Fine, then go!</font>

785
01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:31.210
<font color="#787878">Go, then!</font>

786
01:17:34.121 --> 01:17:35.145
<font color="#787878">Fine.</font>

787
01:17:38.292 --> 01:17:39.953
<font color="#787878">Ron.</font>

788
01:17:43.197 --> 01:17:44.994
<font color="#787878">And you?</font>

789
01:17:46.734 --> 01:17:49.259
<font color="#787878">Are you coming or you staying?</font>

790
01:17:56.377 --> 01:17:59.437
<font color="#787878">Fine. I get it.</font>

791
01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:02.048
<font color="#787878">I saw you two the other night.</font>

792
01:18:02.449 --> 01:18:04.883
<font color="#787878">Ron, that's-- That's nothing.</font>

793
01:18:07.021 --> 01:18:08.386
<font color="#787878">Ron--</font>

794
01:18:11.592 --> 01:18:13.924
<font color="#787878">Ron, where are you going?</font>

795
01:18:14.928 --> 01:18:17.158
<font color="#787878">Please, come back.</font>

796
01:18:18.632 --> 01:18:20.327
<font color="#787878">Ron.</font>

797
01:18:25.039 --> 01:18:26.063
<font color="#787878">Ron!</font>

798
01:19:28.369 --> 01:19:30.997
<font color="#787878">Salvio Hexia.</font>

799
01:19:34.475 --> 01:19:36.909
<font color="#787878">Repellum Muggletum.</font>

800
01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:42.414
<font color="#787878">Salvio Hexia.</font>

801
01:20:03.737 --> 01:20:06.399
<font color="#787878">Poor old Jim's white as a ghost</font>

802
01:20:07.207 --> 01:20:10.404
<font color="#787878">He's found the answer that we lost</font>

803
01:20:10.811 --> 01:20:14.247
<font color="#787878">We're all weeping now
Weeping because</font>

804
01:20:14.815 --> 01:20:20.378
<font color="#787878">There ain't nothing we can do to protect you</font>

805
01:20:20.754 --> 01:20:24.246
<font color="#787878">O children</font>

806
01:20:28.195 --> 01:20:31.926
<font color="#787878">Lift up your voice</font>

807
01:20:32.099 --> 01:20:37.594
<font color="#787878">Lift up your voice</font>

808
01:20:37.771 --> 01:20:40.001
<font color="#787878">Children</font>

809
01:20:43.710 --> 01:20:49.444
<font color="#787878">Rejoice, rejoice</font>

810
01:20:49.616 --> 01:20:53.017
<font color="#787878">Hey, little train, we're jumping on</font>

811
01:20:53.187 --> 01:20:56.918
<font color="#787878">The train that goes to the kingdom</font>

812
01:20:57.458 --> 01:21:00.621
<font color="#787878">We're happy, Ma
We're having fun</font>

813
01:21:00.794 --> 01:21:04.924
<font color="#787878">And the train ain't even left the station</font>

814
01:21:05.098 --> 01:21:08.465
<font color="#787878">Hey, little train, wait for me</font>

815
01:21:08.669 --> 01:21:12.503
<font color="#787878">I once was blind but now I see</font>

816
01:21:12.673 --> 01:21:16.006
<font color="#787878">Have you left a seat for me?</font>

817
01:21:16.176 --> 01:21:20.306
<font color="#787878">Is that such a stretch of the imagination?</font>

818
01:21:20.481 --> 01:21:23.814
<font color="#787878">Hey, little train, wait for me</font>

819
01:21:23.984 --> 01:21:27.852
<font color="#787878">I was held in chains but now I'm free</font>

820
01:21:28.155 --> 01:21:31.056
<font color="#787878">I'm hanging in there
Don't you see?</font>

821
01:21:31.225 --> 01:21:35.685
<font color="#787878">In this process of elimination</font>

822
01:21:35.863 --> 01:21:38.991
<font color="#787878">Hey, little train, we're jumping on</font>

823
01:21:39.233 --> 01:21:42.691
<font color="#787878">The train that goes to the kingdom</font>

824
01:21:43.303 --> 01:21:46.602
<font color="#787878">We're happy, Ma
We're having fun</font>

825
01:21:46.773 --> 01:21:50.675
<font color="#787878">It's beyond my wildest expectation</font>

826
01:21:50.844 --> 01:21:54.075
<font color="#787878">Hey, little train, we're jumping on</font>

827
01:21:54.248 --> 01:21:57.877
<font color="#787878">The train that goes to the kingdom</font>

828
01:21:58.418 --> 01:22:01.615
<font color="#787878">We're happy, Ma
We're having fun</font>

829
01:22:01.788 --> 01:22:06.657
<font color="#787878">The train ain't even left the station</font>

830
01:22:53.373 --> 01:22:54.863
<font color="#787878">Hermione.</font>

831
01:22:55.042 --> 01:22:57.374
<font color="#787878">Hermione? You were right.</font>

832
01:22:57.544 --> 01:22:59.102
<font color="#787878">Snitches have flesh memories....</font>

833
01:22:59.279 --> 01:23:03.909
<font color="#787878">....but I didn't catch the first Snitch with my hand, I almost swallowed it.</font>

834
01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:11.953
<font color="#787878">~ "I open at the close."
~ What do you think that means?</font>

835
01:23:12.125 --> 01:23:13.524
<font color="#787878">I don't know.</font>

836
01:23:15.929 --> 01:23:18.329
<font color="#787878">I found something as well.</font>

837
01:23:24.705 --> 01:23:28.163
<font color="#787878">At first I thought it was an eye, but now I don't think it is.</font>

838
01:23:28.342 --> 01:23:32.506
<font color="#787878">It isn't a rune, and it isn't anywhere in Spellman's Syllabary.</font>

839
01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:36.074
<font color="#787878">Somebody inked it in.
It isn't part of the book. Somebody drew it.</font>

840
01:23:36.249 --> 01:23:39.912
<font color="#787878">Luna's dad was wearing that at Bill and Fleur's wedding.</font>

841
01:23:42.656 --> 01:23:45.955
<font color="#787878">Why would someone draw it
in a children's book?</font>

842
01:23:48.562 --> 01:23:50.996
<font color="#787878">Look, Hermione, I've been thinking.</font>

843
01:23:51.565 --> 01:23:53.658
<font color="#787878">I want to go to Godric's Hollow.</font>

844
01:23:53.834 --> 01:23:56.894
<font color="#787878">It's where I was born.
It's where my parents died.</font>

845
01:23:57.070 --> 01:24:00.665
<font color="#787878">That's exactly where he'll expect you to go because it means something to you.</font>

846
01:24:00.841 --> 01:24:03.275
<font color="#787878">Yeah, but it means something to him too, Hermione.</font>

847
01:24:03.443 --> 01:24:05.434
<font color="#787878">You-Know-Who almost died there.</font>

848
01:24:05.612 --> 01:24:10.276
<font color="#787878">I mean, isn't that exactly the type of place he'd be likely to hide a Horcrux?</font>

849
01:24:11.251 --> 01:24:13.811
<font color="#787878">It's dangerous, Harry.</font>

850
01:24:15.422 --> 01:24:19.415
<font color="#787878">But even I have to admit, recently I've been thinking we'll have to go there.</font>

851
01:24:19.593 --> 01:24:22.027
<font color="#787878">I think it's possible
something else is hidden there.</font>

852
01:24:22.195 --> 01:24:23.719
<font color="#787878">What?</font>

853
01:24:24.431 --> 01:24:26.126
<font color="#787878">The sword.</font>

854
01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:30.500
<font color="#787878">If Dumbledore wanted you to find it, but didn't want it in the Ministry's hands....</font>

855
01:24:30.671 --> 01:24:34.869
<font color="#787878">....where better to hide it than the birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor?</font>

856
01:24:36.209 --> 01:24:38.074
<font color="#787878">Hermione....</font>

857
01:24:43.316 --> 01:24:46.046
<font color="#787878">Don't ever let me
give you a haircut again.</font>

858
01:25:07.307 --> 01:25:09.969
<font color="#787878">I still think we should've used Polyjuice Potion.</font>

859
01:25:10.143 --> 01:25:11.667
<font color="#787878">No.</font>

860
01:25:12.345 --> 01:25:14.540
<font color="#787878">This is where I was born.</font>

861
01:25:14.881 --> 01:25:17.281
<font color="#787878">I'm not returning as someone else.</font>

862
01:25:27.094 --> 01:25:30.086
<font color="#787878">Good night. Ha-ha-ha.</font>

863
01:25:33.133 --> 01:25:35.897
<font color="#787878">Harry, I think it's Christmas Eve.</font>

864
01:25:37.404 --> 01:25:38.701
<font color="#787878">Listen.</font>

865
01:25:44.411 --> 01:25:47.244
<font color="#787878">Do you think they'd be in there, Hermione?</font>

866
01:25:47.681 --> 01:25:49.672
<font color="#787878">My mom and dad.</font>

867
01:25:55.622 --> 01:25:57.886
<font color="#787878">Yeah, I think they would.</font>

868
01:26:34.461 --> 01:26:37.521
<font color="#787878">"Ignotus Peverell."</font>

869
01:26:39.599 --> 01:26:41.226
<font color="#787878">Hey, Harry?</font>

870
01:27:19.105 --> 01:27:21.300
<font color="#787878">Merry Christmas, Hermione.</font>

871
01:27:22.609 --> 01:27:24.839
<font color="#787878">Merry Christmas, Harry.</font>

872
01:27:44.698 --> 01:27:50.102
<font color="#787878">Harry, there's someone
watching us. By the church.</font>

873
01:28:00.814 --> 01:28:02.645
<font color="#787878">I think I know who that is.</font>

874
01:28:04.517 --> 01:28:05.950
<font color="#787878">I don't like this, Harry.</font>

875
01:28:06.119 --> 01:28:11.147
<font color="#787878">Hermione, she knew
Dumbledore. She might have the sword.</font>

876
01:28:30.010 --> 01:28:31.637
<font color="#787878">This is where they died, Hermione.</font>

877
01:28:39.219 --> 01:28:41.687
<font color="#787878">This is where he murdered them.</font>

878
01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:56.134
<font color="#787878">You're Bathilda, aren't you?</font>

879
01:29:01.741 --> 01:29:03.834
<font color="#787878">Here, let me do that.</font>

880
01:29:27.968 --> 01:29:31.870
<font color="#787878">Miss Bagshot, who is this man?</font>

881
01:29:43.483 --> 01:29:45.144
<font color="#787878">Harry.</font>

882
01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:51.054
<font color="#787878">Lumos.</font>

883
01:31:31.424 --> 01:31:32.448
<font color="#787878">Harry!</font>

884
01:32:23.276 --> 01:32:24.334
<font color="#787878">Confringo!</font>

885
01:33:07.086 --> 01:33:09.213
<font color="#787878">Are you feeling better?</font>

886
01:33:12.292 --> 01:33:14.760
<font color="#787878">You've outdone yourself this time, Hermione.</font>

887
01:33:14.928 --> 01:33:17.021
<font color="#787878">The Forest of Dean.</font>

888
01:33:17.997 --> 01:33:22.366
<font color="#787878">I came here once with Mom and Dad, years ago.</font>

889
01:33:23.002 --> 01:33:25.129
<font color="#787878">It's just how I remember it.</font>

890
01:33:25.538 --> 01:33:29.474
<font color="#787878">The trees, the river, everything.</font>

891
01:33:29.776 --> 01:33:32.609
<font color="#787878">Like nothing's changed.</font>

892
01:33:33.846 --> 01:33:36.838
<font color="#787878">Not true, of course.
Everything's changed.</font>

893
01:33:37.817 --> 01:33:41.617
<font color="#787878">If I brought my parents back here now, they probably wouldn't recognize any of it.</font>

894
01:33:43.723 --> 01:33:47.853
<font color="#787878">Not the trees, not the river....</font>

895
01:33:49.629 --> 01:33:51.756
<font color="#787878">....not even me.</font>

896
01:33:56.903 --> 01:33:59.701
<font color="#787878">Maybe we should just stay here, Harry.</font>

897
01:34:01.708 --> 01:34:03.835
<font color="#787878">Grow old.</font>

898
01:34:09.849 --> 01:34:13.148
<font color="#787878">You wanted to know
who the boy in the photograph was.</font>

899
01:34:13.886 --> 01:34:14.978
<font color="#787878">I know.</font>

900
01:34:16.155 --> 01:34:18.555
<font color="#787878">Gellert Grindelwald.</font>

901
01:34:25.498 --> 01:34:28.899
<font color="#787878">He's the thief I saw
in Gregorovitch's Wand Shop.</font>

902
01:34:29.068 --> 01:34:32.333
<font color="#787878">Speaking of which, where is my wand?</font>

903
01:34:33.673 --> 01:34:36.073
<font color="#787878">Where's my wand, Hermione?</font>

904
01:34:44.717 --> 01:34:49.211
<font color="#787878">As we were leaving Godric's Hollow, I cast a curse and it rebounded.</font>

905
01:34:51.958 --> 01:34:53.186
<font color="#787878">I'm sorry.</font>

906
01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:56.488
<font color="#787878">~ I tried to mend it, but wands are different.
~ It's done.</font>

907
01:34:58.464 --> 01:35:02.423
<font color="#787878">Leave me yours.
Go inside and get warm.</font>

908
01:35:02.835 --> 01:35:05.167
<font color="#787878">I'll take the locket as well.</font>

909
01:35:17.717 --> 01:35:19.082
<font color="#787878">Trust me.</font>

910
01:36:44.837 --> 01:36:46.464
<font color="#787878">Lumos.</font>

911
01:37:27.547 --> 01:37:28.912
<font color="#787878">Accio sword.</font>

912
01:37:34.754 --> 01:37:36.654
<font color="#787878">Diffindo.</font>

913
01:39:17.089 --> 01:39:20.252
<font color="#787878">~ Hermione?
~ Are you mental?</font>

914
01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:23.018
<font color="#787878">It was you?</font>

915
01:39:23.195 --> 01:39:26.961
<font color="#787878">Well, yeah. Bit obvious, I think.</font>

916
01:39:27.133 --> 01:39:28.930
<font color="#787878">And you cast the doe as well, did you?</font>

917
01:39:29.502 --> 01:39:33.165
<font color="#787878">~ No, I thought that was you.
~ No, my Patronus is a stag.</font>

918
01:39:33.339 --> 01:39:35.534
<font color="#787878">Right. Yeah. Antlers.</font>

919
01:39:38.711 --> 01:39:41.874
<font color="#787878">Okay, Ron. Do it.</font>

920
01:39:42.848 --> 01:39:46.579
<font color="#787878">I can't handle it. That thing affects me more than it affects you and Hermione.</font>

921
01:39:47.119 --> 01:39:49.747
<font color="#787878">~ All the more reason.
~ No. I can't.</font>

922
01:39:49.922 --> 01:39:51.150
<font color="#787878">Then why are you here?</font>

923
01:39:52.558 --> 01:39:54.617
<font color="#787878">Why did you come back?</font>

924
01:40:02.201 --> 01:40:06.331
<font color="#787878">Now, I'll have to speak to it in order for it to open. When it does, don't hesitate.</font>

925
01:40:06.939 --> 01:40:09.464
<font color="#787878">I don't know what's in there, but it'll put up a fight.</font>

926
01:40:09.642 --> 01:40:12.338
<font color="#787878">The bit of Riddle that was in that diary tried to kill me.</font>

927
01:40:14.814 --> 01:40:16.441
<font color="#787878">All right.</font>

928
01:40:17.283 --> 01:40:18.841
<font color="#787878">One....</font>

929
01:40:19.518 --> 01:40:20.576
<font color="#787878">....two....</font>

930
01:40:21.253 --> 01:40:23.153
<font color="#787878">....three.</font>

931
01:40:33.399 --> 01:40:38.496
<font color="#787878">I have seen your heart, 
and it is mine.</font>

932
01:40:41.107 --> 01:40:45.009
<font color="#787878">I have seen your dreams,
Ronald Weasley....</font>

933
01:40:45.177 --> 01:40:47.577
<font color="#787878">....and I have seen your fears.</font>

934
01:40:49.281 --> 01:40:53.445
<font color="#787878">Least loved by your mother, who craved a daughter.</font>

935
01:40:54.086 --> 01:40:59.080
<font color="#787878">Least loved by the girl
who prefers your friend.</font>

936
01:40:59.258 --> 01:41:01.988
<font color="#787878">Ron, kill it!</font>

937
01:41:08.434 --> 01:41:11.130
<font color="#787878">We were better without you.</font>

938
01:41:11.637 --> 01:41:13.366
<font color="#787878">Happier without you.</font>

939
01:41:13.539 --> 01:41:18.909
<font color="#787878">Who could look at you
compared to Harry Potter?</font>

940
01:41:20.146 --> 01:41:23.479
<font color="#787878">What are you
compared with the Chosen One?</font>

941
01:41:23.649 --> 01:41:24.809
<font color="#787878">Ron, it's lying!</font>

942
01:41:24.984 --> 01:41:27.976
<font color="#787878">Your mother confessed
she would have preferred me as a son.</font>

943
01:41:28.154 --> 01:41:31.146
<font color="#787878">What woman would take you?</font>

944
01:41:31.357 --> 01:41:34.520
<font color="#787878">You are nothing.</font>

945
01:41:34.694 --> 01:41:35.820
<font color="#787878">Nothing.</font>

946
01:41:36.595 --> 01:41:40.622
<font color="#787878">Nothing compared to him.</font>

947
01:42:31.183 --> 01:42:32.844
<font color="#787878">Just think....</font>

948
01:42:33.753 --> 01:42:35.846
<font color="#787878">....only three to go.</font>

949
01:42:38.891 --> 01:42:40.620
<font color="#787878">Hermione?</font>

950
01:42:42.895 --> 01:42:44.624
<font color="#787878">Hermione?</font>

951
01:42:49.168 --> 01:42:51.102
<font color="#787878">Is everything all right?</font>

952
01:42:51.737 --> 01:42:56.401
<font color="#787878">It's fine.
Actually, you know, it's more than fine.</font>

953
01:43:00.846 --> 01:43:02.438
<font color="#787878">Hey.</font>

954
01:43:06.685 --> 01:43:12.885
<font color="#787878">You complete ass, Ronald Weasley!</font>

955
01:43:13.058 --> 01:43:16.721
<font color="#787878">You show up here after weeks, and you say "hey"?</font>

956
01:43:18.931 --> 01:43:21.661
<font color="#787878">~ Where's my wand? Where's my wand?
~ I don't know.</font>

957
01:43:21.834 --> 01:43:24.098
<font color="#787878">~ Harry Potter, give me my wand.
~ I don't have it.</font>

958
01:43:24.270 --> 01:43:28.104
<font color="#787878">~ How come he's got your wand?
~ Never mind why he's got my wand.</font>

959
01:43:30.376 --> 01:43:31.604
<font color="#787878">What is that?</font>

960
01:43:34.547 --> 01:43:35.571
<font color="#787878">You destroyed it.</font>

961
01:43:38.884 --> 01:43:42.843
<font color="#787878">And how is it that you just happen to have the sword of Gryffindor?</font>

962
01:43:43.255 --> 01:43:45.223
<font color="#787878">It's a long story.</font>

963
01:43:48.394 --> 01:43:52.490
<font color="#787878">~ Don't think this changes anything.
~ Oh, of course not.</font>

964
01:43:52.665 --> 01:43:55.930
<font color="#787878">I only just destroyed a bloody Horcrux. Why would that change anything?</font>

965
01:43:56.101 --> 01:44:00.162
<font color="#787878">Look, I wanted to come back as soon as I left.</font>

966
01:44:00.339 --> 01:44:03.775
<font color="#787878">~ I just didn't know how to find you.
~ Yeah, how did you find us?</font>

967
01:44:03.943 --> 01:44:07.003
<font color="#787878">With this. It doesn't just turn off lights.</font>

968
01:44:07.179 --> 01:44:12.082
<font color="#787878">I don't know how it works, but Christmas morning I was sleeping in this little pub....</font>

969
01:44:12.251 --> 01:44:14.685
<font color="#787878">....keeping away from some Snatchers....</font>

970
01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:16.382
<font color="#787878">....and I heard it.</font>

971
01:44:16.789 --> 01:44:18.222
<font color="#787878">It?</font>

972
01:44:19.558 --> 01:44:21.492
<font color="#787878">A voice....</font>

973
01:44:23.095 --> 01:44:24.289
<font color="#787878">....your voice, Hermione....</font>

974
01:44:25.464 --> 01:44:27.091
<font color="#787878">....coming out of it.</font>

975
01:44:27.266 --> 01:44:31.100
<font color="#787878">~ And what exactly did I say, may I ask?
~ My name.</font>

976
01:44:31.704 --> 01:44:33.729
<font color="#787878">Just my name.</font>

977
01:44:34.506 --> 01:44:36.599
<font color="#787878">Like a whisper.</font>

978
01:44:38.577 --> 01:44:44.573
<font color="#787878">So I took it, clicked it,
and this tiny ball of light appeared.</font>

979
01:44:45.050 --> 01:44:46.483
<font color="#787878">And I knew.</font>

980
01:44:47.052 --> 01:44:51.682
<font color="#787878">And sure enough, it floated toward me, the ball of light....</font>

981
01:44:53.392 --> 01:44:57.590
<font color="#787878">....went right to my chest, straight through me. Right here.</font>

982
01:44:58.797 --> 01:45:02.790
<font color="#787878">And I knew it was gonna take me where I needed to go, so I Disapparated....</font>

983
01:45:02.968 --> 01:45:05.232
<font color="#787878">....and came to this hillside.</font>

984
01:45:05.771 --> 01:45:08.296
<font color="#787878">It was dark. I had no idea where I was.</font>

985
01:45:08.841 --> 01:45:11.674
<font color="#787878">I just hoped
that one of you would show yourself.</font>

986
01:45:12.578 --> 01:45:14.102
<font color="#787878">And you did.</font>

987
01:45:31.530 --> 01:45:34.431
<font color="#787878">I've always liked these flames Hermione makes.</font>

988
01:45:38.470 --> 01:45:41.030
<font color="#787878">How long do you reckon
she'll stay mad at me?</font>

989
01:45:42.574 --> 01:45:45.907
<font color="#787878">Well, just keep talking about that little ball of light touching your heart....</font>

990
01:45:46.078 --> 01:45:47.511
<font color="#787878">....and she'll come round.</font>

991
01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:50.410
<font color="#787878">It was true. Every word.</font>

992
01:45:52.217 --> 01:45:54.583
<font color="#787878">This is gonna sound crazy....</font>

993
01:45:55.054 --> 01:45:59.423
<font color="#787878">....but I think that's why Dumbledore left it to me, the Deluminator.</font>

994
01:45:59.925 --> 01:46:04.919
<font color="#787878">I think he knew that somehow I'd need it to find my way back, and she'd lead me.</font>

995
01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:10.530
<font color="#787878">Bloody hell, I just realized, you need a wand, don't you?</font>

996
01:46:10.703 --> 01:46:13.194
<font color="#787878">~ Yeah.
~ I've got one here.</font>

997
01:46:13.472 --> 01:46:16.066
<font color="#787878">It's a blackthorn. Ten inches.</font>

998
01:46:16.241 --> 01:46:19.836
<font color="#787878">Nothing special, but I reckon it'll do.</font>

999
01:46:20.279 --> 01:46:23.077
<font color="#787878">Took if off a Snatcher
a couple of weeks ago.</font>

1000
01:46:23.582 --> 01:46:27.416
<font color="#787878">Don't tell Hermione this,
but they're a bit dim, Snatchers.</font>

1001
01:46:27.686 --> 01:46:30.621
<font color="#787878">This one was definitely part troll, the smell of him.</font>

1002
01:46:30.789 --> 01:46:31.813
<font color="#787878">Engorgio.</font>

1003
01:46:31.991 --> 01:46:34.152
<font color="#787878">~ Reducio!
What's going on in there?</font>

1004
01:46:34.326 --> 01:46:35.588
<font color="#787878">~ Nothing.
~ Nothing.</font>

1005
01:46:37.963 --> 01:46:39.590
<font color="#787878">We need to talk.</font>

1006
01:46:40.399 --> 01:46:41.593
<font color="#787878">Yeah, all right.</font>

1007
01:46:48.574 --> 01:46:52.101
<font color="#787878">~ I want to go see Xenophilius Lovegood.
~ Sorry?</font>

1008
01:46:53.879 --> 01:46:55.506
<font color="#787878">See this?</font>

1009
01:46:55.681 --> 01:46:59.549
<font color="#787878">It's a letter Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald. Look at the signature.</font>

1010
01:47:00.786 --> 01:47:02.981
<font color="#787878">It's the mark again.</font>

1011
01:47:03.922 --> 01:47:06.049
<font color="#787878">It keeps cropping up.</font>

1012
01:47:06.225 --> 01:47:10.594
<font color="#787878">In Beedle the Bard,
in the graveyard in Godric's Hollow.</font>

1013
01:47:11.430 --> 01:47:13.295
<font color="#787878">It was there too.</font>

1014
01:47:13.465 --> 01:47:17.060
<font color="#787878">~ Where?
~ Outside Gregorovitch's Wand Shop.</font>

1015
01:47:17.503 --> 01:47:18.731
<font color="#787878">But what does it mean?</font>

1016
01:47:18.904 --> 01:47:23.705
<font color="#787878">Look, you've got no idea where the next Horcrux is, and neither do I....</font>

1017
01:47:25.411 --> 01:47:28.346
<font color="#787878">....but this, this means something.</font>

1018
01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:32.081
<font color="#787878">~ I'm sure of it.
~ Yeah. Hermione's right.</font>

1019
01:47:33.118 --> 01:47:35.211
<font color="#787878">We ought to see Lovegood.</font>

1020
01:47:35.721 --> 01:47:39.452
<font color="#787878">Let's vote on it. Those in favor?</font>

1021
01:48:03.282 --> 01:48:05.910
<font color="#787878">You're not still mad at him, are you?</font>

1022
01:48:06.218 --> 01:48:08.482
<font color="#787878">I'm always mad at him.</font>

1023
01:48:11.256 --> 01:48:12.746
<font color="#787878">Luna.</font>

1024
01:48:12.925 --> 01:48:14.620
<font color="#787878">Luna.</font>

1025
01:48:22.301 --> 01:48:25.134
<font color="#787878">"Keep off the dirigible plums."</font>

1026
01:48:34.179 --> 01:48:36.875
<font color="#787878">What is it? Who are you?</font>

1027
01:48:37.182 --> 01:48:38.206
<font color="#787878">What do you want?</font>

1028
01:48:38.383 --> 01:48:42.979
<font color="#787878">Hello, Mr. Lovegood. I'm Harry Potter. We met a few months ago.</font>

1029
01:48:46.992 --> 01:48:48.892
<font color="#787878">Could we come in?</font>

1030
01:48:52.664 --> 01:48:55.258
<font color="#787878">~ Where is Luna?
~ Luna?</font>

1031
01:48:56.535 --> 01:48:58.503
<font color="#787878">She'll be along.</font>

1032
01:49:12.017 --> 01:49:14.076
<font color="#787878">So how can I help you, Mr. Potter?</font>

1033
01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:17.946
<font color="#787878">Well, actually....</font>

1034
01:49:18.957 --> 01:49:23.485
<font color="#787878">It was about something you were wearing round your neck at the wedding. A symbol.</font>

1035
01:49:25.030 --> 01:49:26.930
<font color="#787878">You mean this?</font>

1036
01:49:27.332 --> 01:49:28.924
<font color="#787878">Yes.</font>

1037
01:49:29.234 --> 01:49:31.099
<font color="#787878">That exactly.</font>

1038
01:49:31.770 --> 01:49:35.729
<font color="#787878">What we've wondered is, what is it?</font>

1039
01:49:35.908 --> 01:49:37.739
<font color="#787878">What is it?</font>

1040
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:40.879
<font color="#787878">Well, it's the sign of the Deathly Hallows, of course.</font>

1041
01:49:41.046 --> 01:49:42.138
<font color="#787878">~ The what?
~ The what?</font>

1042
01:49:42.314 --> 01:49:44.373
<font color="#787878">The Deathly Hallows.</font>

1043
01:49:44.550 --> 01:49:47.644
<font color="#787878">I assume you're all familiar with "The Tale of the Three Brothers."</font>

1044
01:49:47.819 --> 01:49:49.309
<font color="#787878">~ Yes.
~ No.</font>

1045
01:49:54.660 --> 01:49:56.423
<font color="#787878">I have it in here.</font>

1046
01:50:07.673 --> 01:50:09.300
<font color="#787878">"There were once three brothers....</font>

1047
01:50:09.474 --> 01:50:13.877
<font color="#787878">....who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight."</font>

1048
01:50:14.046 --> 01:50:16.776
<font color="#787878">Midnight. Mom always said "midnight."</font>

1049
01:50:21.787 --> 01:50:25.655
<font color="#787878">But "twilight's" fine. Better, actually.</font>

1050
01:50:27.926 --> 01:50:29.791
<font color="#787878">Do you want to read it?</font>

1051
01:50:29.962 --> 01:50:32.157
<font color="#787878">No. It's fine.</font>

1052
01:50:34.066 --> 01:50:36.000
<font color="#787878">"There were once three brothers....</font>

1053
01:50:36.168 --> 01:50:41.367
<font color="#787878">....who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight.</font>

1054
01:50:43.242 --> 01:50:48.544
<font color="#787878">In time, the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass.</font>

1055
01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:50.745
<font color="#787878">But being learned in the magical arts....</font>

1056
01:50:50.916 --> 01:50:56.081
<font color="#787878">....the three brothers simply waved their wands and made a bridge.</font>

1057
01:50:57.422 --> 01:50:59.515
<font color="#787878">Before they could cross, however....</font>

1058
01:50:59.691 --> 01:51:03.787
<font color="#787878">....they found their path blocked by a hooded figure.</font>

1059
01:51:04.062 --> 01:51:07.930
<font color="#787878">It was Death, and he felt cheated.</font>

1060
01:51:08.100 --> 01:51:11.160
<font color="#787878">Cheated because travelers would normally drown in the river.</font>

1061
01:51:11.336 --> 01:51:13.395
<font color="#787878">But Death was cunning.</font>

1062
01:51:14.039 --> 01:51:17.031
<font color="#787878">He pretended to congratulate the three brothers on their magic....</font>

1063
01:51:17.209 --> 01:51:22.476
<font color="#787878">....and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him.</font>

1064
01:51:23.048 --> 01:51:27.610
<font color="#787878">The oldest asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence.</font>

1065
01:51:27.786 --> 01:51:32.382
<font color="#787878">So Death fashioned him one
from an elder tree that stood nearby.</font>

1066
01:51:33.792 --> 01:51:38.092
<font color="#787878">The second brother decided he wanted to humiliate Death even further....</font>

1067
01:51:38.263 --> 01:51:42.700
<font color="#787878">....and asked for the power to recall loved ones from the grave.</font>

1068
01:51:43.135 --> 01:51:47.435
<font color="#787878">So Death plucked a stone from the river and offered it to him.</font>

1069
01:51:48.173 --> 01:51:52.132
<font color="#787878">Finally,
Death turned to the third brother.</font>

1070
01:51:53.345 --> 01:51:54.778
<font color="#787878">A humble man....</font>

1071
01:51:54.946 --> 01:51:59.144
<font color="#787878">....he asked for something that would allow him to go forth from that place....</font>

1072
01:51:59.318 --> 01:52:02.481
<font color="#787878">....without being followed by Death.</font>

1073
01:52:03.588 --> 01:52:09.458
<font color="#787878">And so it was that Death reluctantly handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.</font>

1074
01:52:12.831 --> 01:52:15.766
<font color="#787878">The first brother traveled
to a distant village....</font>

1075
01:52:15.934 --> 01:52:18.027
<font color="#787878">....where, with the Elder Wand in hand....</font>

1076
01:52:18.203 --> 01:52:21.969
<font color="#787878">....he killed a wizard
with whom he had once quarreled.</font>

1077
01:52:24.176 --> 01:52:27.703
<font color="#787878">Drunk with the power
that the Elder Wand had given him....</font>

1078
01:52:27.879 --> 01:52:30.973
<font color="#787878">....he bragged of his invincibility.</font>

1079
01:52:33.985 --> 01:52:37.443
<font color="#787878">But that night,
another wizard stole the wand....</font>

1080
01:52:37.622 --> 01:52:40.750
<font color="#787878">....and slit the brother's throat for good measure.</font>

1081
01:52:40.959 --> 01:52:44.395
<font color="#787878">And so Death took the first brother for his own.</font>

1082
01:52:45.130 --> 01:52:47.098
<font color="#787878">The second brother journeyed to his home....</font>

1083
01:52:47.265 --> 01:52:50.234
<font color="#787878">....where he took the stone and turned it thrice in hand.</font>

1084
01:52:50.402 --> 01:52:54.862
<font color="#787878">To his delight, the girl he'd once hoped to marry before her untimely death....</font>

1085
01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:57.406
<font color="#787878">....appeared before him.</font>

1086
01:52:57.909 --> 01:53:03.211
<font color="#787878">Yet, soon she turned sad and cold for she did not belong in the mortal world.</font>

1087
01:53:03.382 --> 01:53:05.009
<font color="#787878">Driven mad with hopeless longing....</font>

1088
01:53:05.183 --> 01:53:08.482
<font color="#787878">....the second brother killed himself so as to join her.</font>

1089
01:53:09.688 --> 01:53:12.782
<font color="#787878">And so Death took the second brother.</font>

1090
01:53:12.958 --> 01:53:14.585
<font color="#787878">As for the third brother....</font>

1091
01:53:14.760 --> 01:53:18.992
<font color="#787878">....Death searched for many years but was never able to find him.</font>

1092
01:53:19.164 --> 01:53:22.065
<font color="#787878">Only when he attained a great age did the youngest brother....</font>

1093
01:53:22.234 --> 01:53:26.500
<font color="#787878">....shed the Cloak of Invisibility and give it to his son.</font>

1094
01:53:27.739 --> 01:53:31.869
<font color="#787878">He then greeted Death as an old friend and went with him gladly....</font>

1095
01:53:32.043 --> 01:53:35.206
<font color="#787878">....departing this life as equals."</font>

1096
01:53:37.282 --> 01:53:41.776
<font color="#787878">So there you are.
Those are the Deathly Hallows.</font>

1097
01:53:43.188 --> 01:53:46.248
<font color="#787878">I'm sorry, sir.
I still don't quite understand.</font>

1098
01:53:51.863 --> 01:53:53.956
<font color="#787878">Where's that pen I had?</font>

1099
01:54:04.943 --> 01:54:06.205
<font color="#787878">The Elder Wand.</font>

1100
01:54:07.345 --> 01:54:11.008
<font color="#787878">The most powerful wand ever made.</font>

1101
01:54:21.393 --> 01:54:23.691
<font color="#787878">The Resurrection Stone.</font>

1102
01:54:34.573 --> 01:54:38.339
<font color="#787878">The Cloak of Invisibility.</font>

1103
01:54:40.378 --> 01:54:43.506
<font color="#787878">Together, they make the Deathly Hallows.</font>

1104
01:54:43.782 --> 01:54:49.243
<font color="#787878">Together, they make one
master of Death.</font>

1105
01:54:54.459 --> 01:54:58.122
<font color="#787878">That mark was on a grave
in Godric's Hollow.</font>

1106
01:54:59.231 --> 01:55:01.859
<font color="#787878">Uh, Mr. Lovegood,
does the Peverell Family....</font>

1107
01:55:02.033 --> 01:55:03.864
<font color="#787878">....have anything to do
with the Deathly Hallows?</font>

1108
01:55:04.035 --> 01:55:06.868
<font color="#787878">Uh-- Uh--</font>

1109
01:55:07.038 --> 01:55:10.804
<font color="#787878">Ignotus-- Excuse me. --and his brothers, Cadmus and Antioch....</font>

1110
01:55:10.976 --> 01:55:13.638
<font color="#787878">....are thought to be the original owners of the Hallows....</font>

1111
01:55:13.812 --> 01:55:18.681
<font color="#787878">....and therefore the inspiration for the story. Uh-- Uh--</font>

1112
01:55:18.850 --> 01:55:21.341
<font color="#787878">But your tea's gone cold.</font>

1113
01:55:22.554 --> 01:55:24.545
<font color="#787878">I'll be right back.</font>

1114
01:55:24.723 --> 01:55:26.588
<font color="#787878">Let's go down here.</font>

1115
01:55:28.460 --> 01:55:29.950
<font color="#787878">Let's get out of here.</font>

1116
01:55:30.128 --> 01:55:32.995
<font color="#787878">I'm not drinking any more of that stuff, hot or cold.</font>

1117
01:55:39.304 --> 01:55:41.272
<font color="#787878">Thank you, sir.</font>

1118
01:55:42.173 --> 01:55:45.199
<font color="#787878">~ You forgot the water.
~ Water?</font>

1119
01:55:45.377 --> 01:55:46.810
<font color="#787878">For the tea.</font>

1120
01:55:46.978 --> 01:55:49.538
<font color="#787878">Did--? Did I?</font>

1121
01:55:51.483 --> 01:55:53.644
<font color="#787878">How silly of me.</font>

1122
01:55:55.253 --> 01:55:57.517
<font color="#787878">It's no matter.
We really should be going anyway.</font>

1123
01:55:57.689 --> 01:55:59.748
<font color="#787878">No, you can't!</font>

1124
01:56:03.962 --> 01:56:05.657
<font color="#787878">Sir?</font>

1125
01:56:13.038 --> 01:56:15.632
<font color="#787878">You're my only hope.</font>

1126
01:56:19.511 --> 01:56:23.880
<font color="#787878">They were angry, you see,
about what I'd been writing.</font>

1127
01:56:26.918 --> 01:56:29.045
<font color="#787878">So they took her.</font>

1128
01:56:30.522 --> 01:56:33.286
<font color="#787878">They took my Luna.</font>

1129
01:56:34.993 --> 01:56:36.620
<font color="#787878">My Luna.</font>

1130
01:56:49.107 --> 01:56:52.008
<font color="#787878">But it's really you they want.</font>

1131
01:56:54.245 --> 01:56:56.304
<font color="#787878">Who took her, sir?</font>

1132
01:57:01.453 --> 01:57:02.715
<font color="#787878">Voldemort.</font>

1133
01:57:13.365 --> 01:57:15.663
<font color="#787878">Stop! I've got him!</font>

1134
01:57:32.951 --> 01:57:36.853
<font color="#787878">That treacherous little bleeder. Is there no one we can trust?</font>

1135
01:57:37.022 --> 01:57:39.320
<font color="#787878">They kidnapped her
because he supported me.</font>

1136
01:57:39.491 --> 01:57:41.618
<font color="#787878">He was just desperate.</font>

1137
01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:44.355
<font color="#787878">I'll do the enchantments.</font>

1138
01:57:56.041 --> 01:57:57.474
<font color="#787878">Hello, beautiful.</font>

1139
01:58:02.947 --> 01:58:06.576
<font color="#787878">Well, don't hang about, snatch them.</font>

1140
01:59:17.822 --> 01:59:19.312
<font color="#787878">Harry.</font>

1141
01:59:19.491 --> 01:59:22.460
<font color="#787878">Tell me, Grindelwald.
Tell me where it is.</font>

1142
01:59:23.061 --> 01:59:27.122
<font color="#787878">Grindelwald. Grindelwald. Grindelwald.</font>

1143
01:59:27.866 --> 01:59:31.324
<font color="#787878">Hello, Tom.
I knew you would come one day....</font>

1144
01:59:31.803 --> 01:59:35.762
<font color="#787878">....but surely you must know I no longer have what you seek.</font>

1145
01:59:36.407 --> 01:59:39.433
<font color="#787878">~ Tell me, Grindelwald. Tell me where it is.
~ Ha-ha-ha.</font>

1146
01:59:39.611 --> 01:59:40.976
<font color="#787878">Tell me who possesses it.</font>

1147
01:59:41.179 --> 01:59:46.276
<font color="#787878">The Elder Wand lies with him, of course....</font>

1148
01:59:46.451 --> 01:59:48.715
<font color="#787878">....buried in the earth.</font>

1149
01:59:49.654 --> 01:59:50.985
<font color="#787878">Dumbledore.</font>

1150
02:00:00.031 --> 02:00:01.896
<font color="#787878">The Hallows exist....</font>

1151
02:00:02.066 --> 02:00:05.866
<font color="#787878">....but he's only after one of them, the last one. He knows where it is.</font>

1152
02:00:06.037 --> 02:00:09.871
<font color="#787878">He's gonna have it by the end of the night. You-Know-Who's found the Elder Wand.</font>

1153
02:00:10.041 --> 02:00:12.509
<font color="#787878">~ Don't touch her. Unh!
~ Leave him.</font>

1154
02:00:12.677 --> 02:00:13.939
<font color="#787878">Your boyfriend will get worse than that....</font>

1155
02:00:14.112 --> 02:00:15.238
<font color="#787878">Get off me.</font>

1156
02:00:15.413 --> 02:00:18.143
<font color="#787878">....if he doesn't learn to behave himself.</font>

1157
02:00:21.386 --> 02:00:22.876
<font color="#787878">What happened to you, ugly?</font>

1158
02:00:24.589 --> 02:00:26.454
<font color="#787878">No, not you.</font>

1159
02:00:27.859 --> 02:00:30.919
<font color="#787878">~ What's your name?
~ Dudley. Vernon Dudley.</font>

1160
02:00:31.095 --> 02:00:33.290
<font color="#787878">Check it.</font>

1161
02:00:34.899 --> 02:00:37.231
<font color="#787878">And you, my lovely....</font>

1162
02:00:40.538 --> 02:00:42.529
<font color="#787878">....what do they call you?</font>

1163
02:00:43.975 --> 02:00:48.036
<font color="#787878">Penelope Clearwater, half-blood.</font>

1164
02:00:51.149 --> 02:00:53.083
<font color="#787878">There's no Vernon Dudley on here.</font>

1165
02:00:54.152 --> 02:00:57.383
<font color="#787878">Did you hear that, ugly?
The list says you're lying.</font>

1166
02:00:57.555 --> 02:00:59.785
<font color="#787878">How come you don't want us
to know who you are?</font>

1167
02:00:59.958 --> 02:01:02.620
<font color="#787878">The list's wrong. I told you who I am.</font>

1168
02:01:18.576 --> 02:01:20.669
<font color="#787878">Change of plan.</font>

1169
02:01:21.746 --> 02:01:25.011
<font color="#787878">We're not taking this lot to the Ministry.</font>

1170
02:02:04.689 --> 02:02:08.318
<font color="#787878">Get Draco.</font>

1171
02:02:12.797 --> 02:02:14.355
<font color="#787878">Well?</font>

1172
02:02:17.468 --> 02:02:21.996
<font color="#787878">~ I can't be sure.
~ Draco. Look closely, son.</font>

1173
02:02:23.007 --> 02:02:28.070
<font color="#787878">If we are the ones
to hand Potter over to the Dark Lord....</font>

1174
02:02:28.246 --> 02:02:33.479
<font color="#787878">....everything would be forgiven. All would be as it was, you understand?</font>

1175
02:02:33.651 --> 02:02:37.781
<font color="#787878">Now, we won't be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy.</font>

1176
02:02:37.956 --> 02:02:40.390
<font color="#787878">You dare to
talk to me like that in my own house?</font>

1177
02:02:40.558 --> 02:02:42.355
<font color="#787878">Lucius.</font>

1178
02:02:45.263 --> 02:02:49.097
<font color="#787878">Don't be shy, sweetie. Come over.</font>

1179
02:02:50.601 --> 02:02:55.368
<font color="#787878">Now, if this isn't who we think it is, Draco, and we call him, he'll kill us all.</font>

1180
02:02:55.540 --> 02:02:58.338
<font color="#787878">We need to be absolutely sure.</font>

1181
02:02:58.643 --> 02:02:59.632
<font color="#787878">What's wrong with his face?</font>

1182
02:02:59.811 --> 02:03:01.540
<font color="#787878">Yes, what is wrong with his face?</font>

1183
02:03:01.713 --> 02:03:02.907
<font color="#787878">He came to us like that.</font>

1184
02:03:03.081 --> 02:03:05.049
<font color="#787878">Something he picked up in the forest, I reckon.</font>

1185
02:03:05.216 --> 02:03:08.913
<font color="#787878">Or ran into a Stinging Jinx. Was it you, dearie?</font>

1186
02:03:14.025 --> 02:03:16.789
<font color="#787878">Give me her wand.
We'll see what her last spell was.</font>

1187
02:03:18.062 --> 02:03:20.223
<font color="#787878">Ah. Got you.</font>

1188
02:03:24.035 --> 02:03:25.764
<font color="#787878">What is that?</font>

1189
02:03:27.705 --> 02:03:29.297
<font color="#787878">Where'd you get that from?</font>

1190
02:03:29.474 --> 02:03:32.966
<font color="#787878">It was in her bag when we searched her. Reckon it's mine now.</font>

1191
02:03:36.714 --> 02:03:38.045
<font color="#787878">Are you mad?</font>

1192
02:03:46.357 --> 02:03:49.190
<font color="#787878">Go! Get out!</font>

1193
02:03:54.832 --> 02:03:58.996
<font color="#787878">Cissy, put the boys in the cellar.</font>

1194
02:03:59.170 --> 02:04:04.540
<font color="#787878">I want to have a little conversation with this one, girl-to-girl.</font>

1195
02:04:13.584 --> 02:04:16.678
<font color="#787878">What are we gonna do?
We can't leave Hermione alone with her.</font>

1196
02:04:16.854 --> 02:04:18.219
<font color="#787878">Ron?</font>

1197
02:04:23.428 --> 02:04:24.986
<font color="#787878">Harry?</font>

1198
02:04:30.701 --> 02:04:32.259
<font color="#787878">Luna?</font>

1199
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:37.034
<font color="#787878">That sword is meant to be in my vault at Gringotts. How did you get it?</font>

1200
02:04:37.208 --> 02:04:40.336
<font color="#787878">What else did you and your friends take from my vault?!</font>

1201
02:04:40.511 --> 02:04:45.881
<font color="#787878">I didn't take anything. Please. I didn't take anything.</font>

1202
02:04:46.050 --> 02:04:47.574
<font color="#787878">I don't believe it.</font>

1203
02:04:53.157 --> 02:04:54.249
<font color="#787878">We have to do something.</font>

1204
02:04:54.425 --> 02:04:58.452
<font color="#787878">There's no way out of here. We've tried everything. It's enchanted.</font>

1205
02:04:58.629 --> 02:05:01.325
<font color="#787878">~ Please! please!
~ Shut up!</font>

1206
02:05:01.499 --> 02:05:03.296
<font color="#787878">You're bleeding, Harry.</font>

1207
02:05:03.468 --> 02:05:05.493
<font color="#787878">That's a curious thing
to keep in your sock.</font>

1208
02:05:14.745 --> 02:05:15.871
<font color="#787878">Help us.</font>

1209
02:05:21.652 --> 02:05:23.552
<font color="#787878">~ Let her go.
~ Shut up. Get back.</font>

1210
02:05:24.889 --> 02:05:29.087
<font color="#787878">You, goblin, come with me.</font>

1211
02:05:48.746 --> 02:05:50.236
<font color="#787878">~ Aah!
~ Dobby?</font>

1212
02:05:51.115 --> 02:05:52.514
<font color="#787878">What are you doing here?</font>

1213
02:05:52.683 --> 02:05:54.947
<font color="#787878">Dobby has come to rescue
Harry Potter, of course.</font>

1214
02:05:55.119 --> 02:05:57.587
<font color="#787878">Dobby will always be there
for Harry Potter.</font>

1215
02:05:57.755 --> 02:06:01.350
<font color="#787878">You can Apparate in and out of this room? Could you take us with you?</font>

1216
02:06:01.526 --> 02:06:03.289
<font color="#787878">Of course, sir. I'm an elf.</font>

1217
02:06:04.095 --> 02:06:05.960
<font color="#787878">Works for me.</font>

1218
02:06:06.197 --> 02:06:08.563
<font color="#787878">Dobby, I want you to take Luna and Mr. Ollivander--</font>

1219
02:06:08.733 --> 02:06:11.167
<font color="#787878">Shell Cottage
on the outskirts of Tinworth.</font>

1220
02:06:11.536 --> 02:06:12.560
<font color="#787878">Trust me.</font>

1221
02:06:13.371 --> 02:06:14.804
<font color="#787878">Whenever you're ready, sir.</font>

1222
02:06:15.506 --> 02:06:18.202
<font color="#787878">Sir? I like her very much.</font>

1223
02:06:23.147 --> 02:06:26.446
<font color="#787878">Meet me at the top of the stairs in 10 seconds.</font>

1224
02:06:35.526 --> 02:06:37.289
<font color="#787878">Ow.</font>

1225
02:06:42.700 --> 02:06:44.930
<font color="#787878">Who gets his wand?</font>

1226
02:06:47.672 --> 02:06:51.665
<font color="#787878">I'm only going to
ask you once more, goblin.</font>

1227
02:06:51.842 --> 02:06:55.243
<font color="#787878">Think very, very carefully
before you answer.</font>

1228
02:06:55.613 --> 02:06:57.171
<font color="#787878">I don't know.</font>

1229
02:06:57.348 --> 02:07:00.545
<font color="#787878">You don't know?
Why weren't you doing your job?</font>

1230
02:07:00.718 --> 02:07:03.949
<font color="#787878">Who got into my vault?</font>

1231
02:07:05.223 --> 02:07:09.660
<font color="#787878">Who stole it? Who stole it? Well?</font>

1232
02:07:09.827 --> 02:07:13.854
<font color="#787878">When I was last in your vault, the sword was there.</font>

1233
02:07:16.634 --> 02:07:19.831
<font color="#787878">Oh, well then, perhaps
it just walked out on its own then.</font>

1234
02:07:20.004 --> 02:07:22.438
<font color="#787878">There is no place safer than Gringotts.</font>

1235
02:07:22.607 --> 02:07:24.040
<font color="#787878">Liar!</font>

1236
02:07:25.977 --> 02:07:29.378
<font color="#787878">Consider yourself lucky, goblin.</font>

1237
02:07:31.816 --> 02:07:35.217
<font color="#787878">The same won't be said for this one.</font>

1238
02:07:35.386 --> 02:07:37.149
<font color="#787878">Like hell.</font>

1239
02:07:37.888 --> 02:07:39.116
<font color="#787878">Expellliarmus!</font>

1240
02:07:40.558 --> 02:07:41.650
<font color="#787878">Stupefy.</font>

1241
02:07:45.796 --> 02:07:47.161
<font color="#787878">Stop!</font>

1242
02:07:48.332 --> 02:07:49.890
<font color="#787878">Drop your wands.</font>

1243
02:07:52.770 --> 02:07:53.794
<font color="#787878">I said, drop them!</font>

1244
02:07:55.306 --> 02:07:56.739
<font color="#787878">Pick them up, Draco, now.</font>

1245
02:07:57.608 --> 02:08:01.738
<font color="#787878">Well, well, well,
look what we have here.</font>

1246
02:08:03.347 --> 02:08:04.837
<font color="#787878">It's Harry Potter.</font>

1247
02:08:05.616 --> 02:08:11.987
<font color="#787878">He's all bright and shiny and new again, just in time for the Dark Lord.</font>

1248
02:08:12.156 --> 02:08:14.181
<font color="#787878">Call him.</font>

1249
02:08:17.928 --> 02:08:19.725
<font color="#787878">Call him.</font>

1250
02:08:54.932 --> 02:08:56.763
<font color="#787878">Stupefy!</font>

1251
02:08:57.535 --> 02:08:59.230
<font color="#787878">Stupid elf.</font>

1252
02:08:59.403 --> 02:09:02.429
<font color="#787878">~ You could've killed me.
~ Dobby never meant to kill.</font>

1253
02:09:02.606 --> 02:09:06.633
<font color="#787878">Dobby only meant to maim
or seriously injure.</font>

1254
02:09:08.946 --> 02:09:12.279
<font color="#787878">How dare you take a witch's wand?</font>

1255
02:09:12.450 --> 02:09:15.442
<font color="#787878">How dare you defy your masters?</font>

1256
02:09:15.619 --> 02:09:18.747
<font color="#787878">Dobby has no master.</font>

1257
02:09:18.923 --> 02:09:21.414
<font color="#787878">Dobby is a free elf.</font>

1258
02:09:21.592 --> 02:09:26.552
<font color="#787878">And Dobby has come
to save Harry Potter and his friends.</font>

1259
02:09:56.394 --> 02:09:58.055
<font color="#787878">Hermione.</font>

1260
02:09:58.229 --> 02:10:00.720
<font color="#787878">You're all right. We're safe.</font>

1261
02:10:00.898 --> 02:10:02.923
<font color="#787878">We're all safe.</font>

1262
02:10:03.801 --> 02:10:05.996
<font color="#787878">Harry Potter.</font>

1263
02:10:09.740 --> 02:10:11.571
<font color="#787878">Dobby.</font>

1264
02:10:22.086 --> 02:10:25.146
<font color="#787878">Dobby. No, just-- Hold on.</font>

1265
02:10:25.322 --> 02:10:29.656
<font color="#787878">Hold on. Look, just hold on, okay?</font>

1266
02:10:29.827 --> 02:10:31.886
<font color="#787878">We'll fix you.</font>

1267
02:10:32.329 --> 02:10:35.059
<font color="#787878">Hermione will have something.</font>

1268
02:10:35.232 --> 02:10:37.564
<font color="#787878">In your bag. Hermione?</font>

1269
02:10:39.203 --> 02:10:40.534
<font color="#787878">Hermione?</font>

1270
02:10:42.740 --> 02:10:45.868
<font color="#787878">What is it? Help me.</font>

1271
02:10:48.446 --> 02:10:51.574
<font color="#787878">Such a beautiful place....</font>

1272
02:10:53.751 --> 02:10:56.015
<font color="#787878">....to be with friends.</font>

1273
02:10:57.822 --> 02:11:03.226
<font color="#787878">Dobby is happy to be with his friend....</font>

1274
02:11:05.629 --> 02:11:08.063
<font color="#787878">....Harry Potter.</font>

1275
02:11:28.853 --> 02:11:31.253
<font color="#787878">We should close his eyes.</font>

1276
02:11:31.489 --> 02:11:33.514
<font color="#787878">Don't you think?</font>

1277
02:11:38.629 --> 02:11:40.028
<font color="#787878">There.</font>

1278
02:11:40.498 --> 02:11:42.932
<font color="#787878">Now he could be sleeping.</font>

1279
02:11:58.249 --> 02:12:00.308
<font color="#787878">I want to bury him.</font>

1280
02:12:01.352 --> 02:12:04.913
<font color="#787878">Properly. Without magic.</font>
