00:00:00,642 --> 00:00:02,027 

Spock, I'll pick you up! 


2 

00:00:02,028 --> 00:00:04,784 

Negative. 
It's our only chance 

to save the species. 


3 

00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:07,053 

When the volcano erupts, the planet dies. 


4 

00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,358 

Pick it! 
Now!

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,074 

Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org 


6 

00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,650 

Spock, are you all right? 


7 

00:00:33,587 --> 00:00:36,770 

Surprisingly, I'm still alive. 


8 

00:00:36,938 --> 00:00:37,978 

Rãmâneþi the reception hall. 


9 

00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:40,024 

Come to save him. 

I'm the team and I go down. 


10 

00:00:40,025 --> 00:00:41,025 

Had to abandon the shuttle. 


11 

00:00:41,026 --> 00:00:43,286 

- You can not leave him there, Sulu! 

- We have no choice. 


12 

00:00:43,287 --> 00:00:44,387 

Sorry, Uhura. 


13 

00:00:44,888 --> 00:00:47,816 

Spock back 

Enterprise. 
Bump us. 


14 

00:00:47,817 --> 00:00:49,580 

Captain abandoned spacecraft. 


15 

00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,459 

You must ajungeþi 

alone on the Enterprise. 


16 

00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,560 

Gorgeous. 


17 

00:00:52,997 --> 00:00:55,511 

- Uhura, you're ready to iNOS? 

- Yes. 


18 

00:00:59,557 --> 00:01:02,141 

Jim, the beach is the other. 


19th 

00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,443 

I know. 
We do not go to the beach! 


20 

00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:06,394 

Oh no! 


21 

00:01:10,715 --> 00:01:12,641 

I hate that! 


22 

00:01:12,642 --> 00:01:14,245 

I know! 


23 

00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,910 

And how ridiculous is Tisi 

to hide a ship on the ocean floor? 


24 

00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,480 

All sitting here last night. 

A saltwater erode ... 


25 

00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:04,427 

Scotty! 
Where is Spock? 


26th 

00:02:04,836 --> 00:02:06,308 

All the volcano, sir. 


27th 

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,732 

Captain on the bridge! 


28th 

00:02:49,282 --> 00:02:51,931 

Lieutenant, you open a channel 

for Mr. Spock? 


29th 

00:02:51,932 --> 00:02:54,154 

Heat affects his communicator 

but we are still in touch with him. 


30 

00:02:56,304 --> 00:02:57,556 

Spock! 


31 

00:02:57,698 --> 00:02:59,353 

I activated the device, Captain. 


32 

00:02:59,978 --> 00:03:02,741 

At the end of the countdown, 

reacþia a volcano make inert. 


33 

00:03:02,742 --> 00:03:04,255 

Yeah, make him him and inert. 


34 

00:03:04,256 --> 00:03:05,898 

- We can use the transporter? 

- Negative, sir. 


35 

00:03:05,899 --> 00:03:08,806 

- Not in the magnetic field ... 

- I want to beam Spock here. 


36 

00:03:08,807 --> 00:03:10,007 

Finds a solution! 


37 

00:03:10,628 --> 00:03:13,047 

If we have direct sightlines ... 


38 

00:03:13,048 --> 00:03:15,488 

No way. 
I had to do 

with an active volcano. 


39 

00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:18,786 

Sir, if I erupts, do not guarantee 

that will withstand the heat. 


40 

00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:20,589 

I do not know if we menþine altitude. 


41 

00:03:20,985 --> 00:03:22,689 

Our shuttle was hidden 

The cloud of ashes, 


42 

00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,143 

but Enterprise is too high. 


43 

00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,792 

If demaraþi a rescue action, 

Note the indigenous species Vesi be. 


44 

00:03:27,793 --> 00:03:29,730 

Spock, nobody knows 

rules better than you, 


45 

00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:31,598 

But there must be an exception. 


46 

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,164 

Nothing. 
It's an action that violates 

First director. 


47 

00:03:34,165 --> 00:03:36,191 

Shut up, Spock. 
Trying to save you! 


48 

00:03:36,292 --> 00:03:39,051 

Doctor weigh the needs of the milking 

more than the needs of the least. 


49 

00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,824 

Spock's your life of the game. 


50 

00:03:41,135 --> 00:03:42,835 

Regulation can not 

be violated in any ... 


51 

00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,894 

52 

00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:46,797 

Trying to reconnect. 


53 

00:03:46,899 --> 00:03:48,728 

90 seconds to detonation. 


54 

00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,037 

If Spock were here 

And I go, what should I do? 


55 

00:03:56,996 --> 00:03:59,148 

You would let you die. 


56 

00:05:40,895 --> 00:05:42,059 

57 

00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:44,022 

Are you okay? 


58 

00:05:44,318 --> 00:05:46,041 

Captain, did you let us see the ship. 


59 

00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:47,737 

He has nothing. 


60 

00:05:47,842 --> 00:05:49,783 

- Bridge to Captain Kirk. 

- Yes, lt. 


61 

00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:51,789 

Commander Spock aboard, sir? 


62 

00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,082 

Alive and unharmed. 


63 

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,490 

Comunicaþi him that detonation 

successfully held device. 


64 

00:05:57,584 --> 00:05:59,827 

Have you heard? 
Congratulations, Spock. 


65 

00:06:00,423 --> 00:06:01,817 

You just saved the world. 


66 

00:06:01,818 --> 00:06:03,689 

Aces violated the First Directive. 


67 

00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:06,164 

Come on, Spock. 
We have seen. 

Big deal. 


68 

00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,279 

Star Trek 

In the dark 




70 

00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:41,119 

I Royal Hospital of Pediatrics </ i> 


71 

00:08:44,762 --> 00:08:46,346 

I can save. 


72 

00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,071 

What did you say? 


73 

00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:54,053 

Your daughter. 


74 

00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,169 

75 

00:08:58,092 --> 00:08:59,479 

Who are you? 


76 

00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:20,560 

Get back. 
Forget that. 


77 

00:09:22,383 --> 00:09:24,688 

Just not an answer, is not it? 


78 

00:09:25,271 --> 00:09:26,938 

I San Francisco 

Starfleet Headquarters </ i> 


79 

00:09:26,939 --> 00:09:29,498 

Spock, listen. 

That's why we called. 
Feel. 


80 

00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,279 

Leaving emotions aside, 

I think it's very unlikely 


81 

00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,281 

us to be select 

for the new program. 


82 

00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:36,888 

Why else would we call Pike? 


83 

00:09:37,195 --> 00:09:40,426 

It's not routine. 

He gave us the newest ship in the fleet. 


84 

00:09:40,427 --> 00:09:42,598 

- I was sure of and i 

- There are numerous the possibilities ... 


85 

00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:44,376 

A five-year mission, Spock. 


86 

00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:47,128 

Unexplored space, 

uncharted territories. 


87 

00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,550 

Think about how you'll be thrilling. 


88 

00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,155 

Hello, ladies. 
Jim Kirk. 


89 

00:09:51,972 --> 00:09:53,992 

- Nothing remarkable. 

- Admiral? 


90 

00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,721 

So you describe exploration 

Nibiru in Captain's Log. 


91 

00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,581 

Yes, sir, I wanted to lose 

time with the details. 


92 

00:09:58,582 --> 00:10:00,521 

Fish Story me more 

about the volcano. 


93 

00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:04,169 

Sensors show is very unstable. 

If you erupt, you desolate planet. 


94 

00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,630 

- Hopefully not erupt, sir. 

- May I fish story. 


95 

00:10:08,225 --> 00:10:11,300 

Unstable is a relative term. 

I think I had the wrong information. 


96 

00:10:11,525 --> 00:10:13,718 

Or maybe erupted 

Because Mr. Spock 


97 

00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:16,399 

detonated a device 

Cold fusion within him, 


98 

00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,155 

immediately after a civilization 

hardly invented the wheel 


99 

00:10:20,156 --> 00:10:23,304 

saw a ship spaces 

how to pick up from the ocean. 


100 

00:10:23,305 --> 00:10:25,565 

That's how you describe the situation, right? 


101 

00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:27,416 

- I ... 

- Did you write a report? 


102 

00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:28,793 

Why did not you tell me? 


103 

00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,361 

I assumed wrongly that Vesi says 

Truth in Captain's Log. 


104 

00:10:31,362 --> 00:10:33,101 

Yeah, I'd have said 

If I was forced to save life of. 


105 

00:10:33,102 --> 00:10:34,898 

A fact for which you are 

deeply grateful 


106 

00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:37,432 

And why we considered 

need to take responsibility 


107 

00:10:37,433 --> 00:10:38,533 

the actions taken ... 


108 

00:10:38,534 --> 00:10:42,110 

Yes, you have a noble eared 

unless you give me and push the pit. 


109 

00:10:42,111 --> 00:10:43,808 

Toad? 
Is it 

an offensive term? 


110 

00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,143 

Gentlemen. 


111 

00:10:46,232 --> 00:10:49,698 

Starfleet's mission to observe 

And to explore, not to intervene. 


112 

00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:51,630 

If the mission had gone 

as planned, Admiral, 


113 

00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:54,142 

indigenous species would be found 

The intervention never ours. 


114 

00:10:54,143 --> 00:10:56,208 

- It's a technicality. 

- Are Vulcan, sir. 


115 

00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:58,556 

- We focus on technical details. 

- Leave that attitude, Spock. 


116 

00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:01,020 

Show more attitude 

At the same time, sir. 


117 

00:11:01,304 --> 00:11:03,178 

- At your referiþi? 

- Out. 


118 

00:11:04,486 --> 00:11:06,102 

You're free, Commander. 


119 

00:11:14,739 --> 00:11:17,278 

You know what pain you? 


120 

00:11:18,676 --> 00:11:19,940 

I think so, sir. 


121 

00:11:19,941 --> 00:11:22,625 

Tell me if you know what you wrong. 

What you Invasive LECS now? 


122 

00:11:23,703 --> 00:11:24,833 

Do not trust a Vulcan. 


123 

00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:27,303 

See? 
Not even possible 

to answer questions. 
You mins. 


124 

00:11:27,304 --> 00:11:29,264 

You mins in a formal report. 


125 

00:11:29,265 --> 00:11:31,972 

Do you think the rules did not apply 

Because you're not agree with them. 


126 

00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:34,955 

So I convinced to join up aces. 

Therefore I gave aces ship. 


127 

00:11:34,956 --> 00:11:37,587 

And I gave the ship 

Because I saw you potentially. 


128 

00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:42,170 

And now I see 

that you have no hint of modesty. 


129 

00:11:42,171 --> 00:11:43,190 

What to do? 


130 

00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:44,354 

- Spock let him die? 

- That's not the point. 


131 

00:11:44,355 --> 00:11:46,149 

I think not, sir. 
You have done what aces? 


132 

00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:49,679 

I would not have risked life of 

Prime ofiþerului my first. 


133 

00:11:49,898 --> 00:11:53,256 

Needs to investigate a planet 

not change his destiny. 


134 

00:11:53,257 --> 00:11:57,966 

You've broken dozens of rules of Fleet 

And it was to kill the crew. 


135 

00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,134 

But I did. 

And Tisi CASI members of the crew have lost ... 


136 

00:12:01,135 --> 00:12:01,889 

- ... 
since I took command? 

- This and the defect is. 


137 

00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,146 

- You think you're infallible. 

- Not one. 


138 

00:12:03,147 --> 00:12:05,385 

You think not possible to make mistakes. 

Always the same story with you. 


139 

00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:07,752 

- Rules are for the ALSI. 

- It should. 


140 

00:12:07,753 --> 00:12:10,568 

And what's worse is that uses your 

luck as an excuse 


141 

00:12:10,569 --> 00:12:12,002 

to prance. 


142 

00:12:15,263 --> 00:12:18,333 

Given the circumstances, 

question came from Admiral Marcus. 


143 

00:12:18,334 --> 00:12:21,202 

He convened a special court 

to which I was invited. 


144 

00:12:21,203 --> 00:12:25,220 

Understanding the rules requiring Fleet 

to do in such a situation? 


145 

00:12:29,444 --> 00:12:31,632 

And they took command Enterprise. 


146 

00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:34,679 

You're sent back to the academy. 


147 

00:12:39,904 --> 00:12:40,936 

Admiral, ascultaþi. 


148 

00:12:40,937 --> 00:12:45,383 

No, why should I listen? 
You do not asculþi 

anyone but you. 


149 

00:12:45,467 --> 00:12:47,331 

Not possible to asculþi. 


150 

00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:50,962 

No strands to the rules, 

not take responsibility for anything, 


151 

00:12:50,963 --> 00:12:53,438 

Respecþi and not the function. 


152 

00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,401 

Do you know why? 


153 

00:12:57,981 --> 00:12:59,605 

Because you're not ready for it. 


154 

00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:18,248 

I London </ i> 


155 

00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,197

157 

00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,552 

- How did you find? 

- I know you better than you think. 


158 

00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:30,116 

I first met 

in a dive like that. 


159 

00:16:31,162 --> 00:16:33,659 

IBS mind? 
Have you eaten 

a beating. 


160 

00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,250 

- No. 

- No strands mind? 


161 

00:16:36,251 --> 00:16:39,080 

- No, it was ... 

- You took a hell of a beating. 


162 

00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,935 

- You were and erveþele nose. 


163 

00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,147 

Not you? 


164 

00:16:46,257 --> 00:16:47,973 

Yes, it was a decent swing. 


165 

00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,664 

A decent swing. 


166 

00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:55,584 

Look, that's your problem. 


167 

00:17:00,663 --> 00:17:02,068 

I gave it back. 


168 

00:17:03,415 --> 00:17:04,735 

Enterprise. 


169 

00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:18,356 

Congratulations. 


170 

00:17:20,555 --> 00:17:22,958 

Let Aves Prime ofiþerul great care. 


171 

00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:27,128 

Spock never going to work with me. 

He was transferred. 


172 

00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,267 

The USS Bradbury. 


173 

00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:34,219 

You'll be my first ofiþer. 


174 

00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,480 

Yes, I was slightly 

to convince Marcus. 


175 

00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,618 

But sometimes I can be very eloquent. 


176 

00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:47,055 

-177 

00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:49,167 

Truth. 


178 

00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:51,254 

I believe in you. 


179 

00:17:52,961 --> 00:17:56,014 

And that Jim Kirk deserves a second chance. 


180 

00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:08,364 

I do not know what to say. 


181 

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,328 

Now that premiere. 


182 

00:18:12,186 --> 00:18:14,334 

It's all right, son. 


183 

00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:23,632 

And the emergency edinþã the Daystrom. 


184 

00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,058 

We name. 


185 

00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:27,495 

Yes. 


186 

00:18:28,673 --> 00:18:30,159 

Put the uniform. 


187 

00:18:46,027 --> 00:18:47,861 

- Captain. 

- I'm not captain, Spock. 


188 

00:18:47,862 --> 00:18:49,525 

I first ofiþer. 


189 

00:18:50,862 --> 00:18:52,905 

I was relegated 

And you were moved. 


190 

00:18:53,517 --> 00:18:56,309 

Glad to see 

that the consequences were not more serious. 


191 

00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:57,584 

You gotta be kidding. 


192 

00:18:57,585 --> 00:18:59,834 

- Captain, my intention was not ... 

- No captain. 


193 

00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:03,423 

And I saved the life of Spock. 
You wrote 

report and I lost my ship. 


194 

00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:09,987 

Commander, I realize now that had 

announced that I sent you the report. 


195 

00:19:10,318 --> 00:19:13,232 

I know your obsession 

to follow the rules, 


196 

00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:14,433 

but I can not do that. 


197 

00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:19,016 

Here, when someone saves life of me, 

not stick a Cushite back. 


198 

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,425 

Vulcans do not lie. 


199 

00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:23,255 

Then I ask 

human side of you. 


200 

00:19:23,783 --> 00:19:26,872 

Understanding why I came after you? 


201 

00:19:26,873 --> 00:19:30,334 

Commander Spock? 
I'm Frank Abbott 

202 

00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,335 

We'll work with me. 


203 

00:19:33,561 --> 00:19:35,174 

Yes, Captain. 


204 

00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,464 

Do you know ... 


205 

00:19:46,148 --> 00:19:47,335 

... 
That you and I miss. 


206 

00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,860 

Admiral Marcus arrives. 


207 

00:19:59,436 --> 00:20:01,640 

Thanked aces that came so quickly. 


208 

00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:03,767 

Had taken place. 


209 

00:20:06,182 --> 00:20:08,451 

Perhaps some of you have found 

already that happened in London. 


210 

00:20:08,895 --> 00:20:12,391 

Sinta was an archive of the Fleet. 

Now it's just a smoking crater. 


211 

00:20:12,392 --> 00:20:13,792 

42 people are Morse. 


212 

00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:17,525 

An hour ago, I received a message 

from Starfleet ofiþer 


213 

00:20:17,526 --> 00:20:19,708 

who told me 

that he committed the bombing. 


214 

00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:23,735 

He was forced by this man, 

Commander John Harrison. 


215 

00:20:23,936 --> 00:20:28,247 

He's one of of our. 
He's guilty 

this act of cruelty. 


216 

00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:33,350 

For unknown reasons, John Harrison 

declared war fleet alone. 


217 

00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:39,100 

We must not allow in any case 

Federation spaces to flee. 


218 

00:20:39,347 --> 00:20:42,838 

I comandaþi all ships in the region. 


219 

00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:45,585 

And on behalf of 

that we lost, 


220 

00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,305 

We'll încolþiþi the bastard. 


221 

00:20:49,268 --> 00:20:52,521 

It's a manhunt. 

Let's do it. 


222 

00:20:53,213 --> 00:20:56,072 

Perimeter sensors Earth 

signals were detected in warp 


223 

00:20:56,073 --> 00:20:58,313 

within the system 

So we know that can not be far. 


224 

00:20:59,284 --> 00:21:01,545 

Vesi has ships 

the formations of the blockade, 


225 

00:21:01,546 --> 00:21:04,651 

Vesi and organize search teams ... 


226 

00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:09,152 

This man does not forbid you to kill ... 


227 

00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:19,615 

Are Authorized 

to Use the specified torque to defend. 


228 

00:21:19,926 --> 00:21:21,434 

- What's in the briefcase? 

- Not now. 


229 

00:21:21,435 --> 00:21:23,699 

Not seem strange 

they are is an archive? 


230 

00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,116 

It's as if a library would attack. 


231 

00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,104 

Chris, is everything okay? 


232 

00:21:27,576 --> 00:21:31,924 

Yes, sir. 
Mr. Kirk still accommodates 

the role of Prime ofiþer. 


233 

00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:34,641 

If you have something to say, Kirk, 

says. 
Tomorrow may be too late. 


234 

00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:39,172 

Nothing, sir. 
I apologize. 


235 

00:21:39,273 --> 00:21:40,894 

Go ahead. 
Do not be shy. 


236 

00:21:42,695 --> 00:21:44,776 

Why this archive? 


237 

00:21:45,174 --> 00:21:47,535 

All the information 

there were public. 


238 

00:21:47,536 --> 00:21:50,330 

When will necessarily 

to strike fleet 


239 

00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,482 

This could be just the beginning. 


240 

00:21:53,483 --> 00:21:54,583 

Top of that, Mr. Kirk? 


241 

00:21:54,584 --> 00:21:57,577 

Sir, in case of attack, 

Protocol dictates 


242 

00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:00,931 

as ofiþerii commanders, 

masters and Prime ofiþeri, to gather 


243 

00:22:00,932 --> 00:22:03,395 

Starfleet Headquarters, here. 


244 

00:22:04,647 --> 00:22:05,683 

In this room. 


245 

00:22:05,684 --> 00:22:09,052 

How can Harrison to reach 

here without a ship with warp drive ... 


246 

00:22:15,148 --> 00:22:16,432 

Out! 


247 

00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:26,944 

We need air defense 

the room and the Daystrom Edina. 


248 

00:26:52,515 --> 00:26:53,533 

249 

00:26:53,534 --> 00:26:57,625 

Commander, Mr. Scott found 

Harrison's ship wreck something. 


250 

00:26:58,296 --> 00:27:00,903 

We called the emergency. 


251 

00:27:02,249 --> 00:27:06,559 

Captain, I found this among the remains 

shuttle. 
So crooked escaped. 


252 

00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,241 

- What do you mean? 

- It's a portable conveyor transwarp. 


253 

00:27:09,442 --> 00:27:12,962 

- Possible to find out where he went? 

- We have already learned, sir. 
I'll enjoy. 


254 

00:27:14,955 --> 00:27:18,554 

Went in one place 

where we can not go. 


255 

00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:24,045 

Admiral, not on Earth. 


256 

00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:27,355 

It's on the Kronos, sir. 


257 

00:27:28,017 --> 00:27:30,894 

I request you depending repuneþi 

I sent them and I'm going after him. 


258 

00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,828 

Leave the us a minute. 


259 

00:27:35,761 --> 00:27:36,763 

- Kronos? 

- Yes, sir. 


260 

00:27:36,764 --> 00:27:39,030 

So Harrison took 

parent planet Klingon? 


261 

00:27:39,431 --> 00:27:41,113 

- A deserted? 

- Not sure, sir. 


262 

00:27:41,114 --> 00:27:43,627 

It was established in the province Keth, 

uninhabited region. 


263 

00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:45,260 

Hiding there, sir. 


264 

00:27:45,261 --> 00:27:48,098 

He knows that if we approach 

The Klingon spaces, there will be war. 


265 

00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,879 

Fleet can not go 

after him, but I did. 


266 

00:27:51,272 --> 00:27:52,797 

Please, sir. 


267 

00:27:55,232 --> 00:27:57,593 

The war with the Klingons is inevitable, 

Mr. Kirk. 


268 

00:27:57,594 --> 00:27:59,202 

My guess has begun. 


269 

00:27:59,203 --> 00:28:01,465 

Ever since I learned of their existence, 

Klingon Empire 


270 

00:28:01,466 --> 00:28:04,061 

already conquered and occupied two planets. 


271 

00:28:04,062 --> 00:28:06,016 

They fired about six times 

in our ships. 


272 

00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:10,672 

Moving towards us. 


273 

00:28:12,219 --> 00:28:14,357 

Buildings in London was not a cache. 


274 

00:28:14,538 --> 00:28:18,235 

It was the headquarters of a secret division of the Fleet 

called Section 31. 


275 

00:28:18,983 --> 00:28:20,566 

Working on defensive technologies 


276 

00:28:20,567 --> 00:28:23,076 

Ofiþeri trained and to obtain 

information about Klingons 


277 

00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:26,042 

And Al and potential enemies 

able to hit us. 


278 

00:28:26,363 --> 00:28:28,066 

Harrison was one of the best 

you of our servants. 


279 

00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,167 

Now it's a runner and want to remove it. 


280 

00:28:32,362 --> 00:28:35,004 

Pike always said you're one 

of the men of our isteþi. 


281 

00:28:35,733 --> 00:28:37,720 

You should have heard him defend yourself. 


282 

00:28:38,542 --> 00:28:41,203 

He has convinced 

to enlist in Starfleet, is not it? 


283 

00:28:42,108 --> 00:28:43,150 

Yes, sir. 


284 

00:28:43,451 --> 00:28:45,897 

And say who persuaded him 

him to enlist? 


285 

00:28:50,369 --> 00:28:52,066 

I am responsible for his death. 


286 

00:28:53,835 --> 00:28:55,013 

And I will be yours. 


287 

00:28:55,246 --> 00:28:56,485 

Sir, please. 
All you ... 


288 

00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:58,451 

Mr. Spock, you said that the province 

the hides Harrison 


289 

00:28:58,452 --> 00:28:59,452 

uninhabited? 


290 

00:28:59,453 --> 00:29:00,729 

291 

00:29:04,162 --> 00:29:06,452 

In our defensive strategy, 

Section 31 created 


292 

00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,350 

a new type of photon torpedo. 


293 

00:29:10,732 --> 00:29:11,967 

It has long range, it's screen. 


294 

00:29:11,968 --> 00:29:14,319 

It'll be invisible 

Klingon sensors. 


295 

00:29:14,716 --> 00:29:17,211 

I do not want to get hurt, 

but I want to remove. 


296 

00:29:17,684 --> 00:29:21,446 

You stop at the edge of the Neutral Zone, 

Sinti and your position Harrison, 


297 

00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:23,716 

open fire, killing him 

And take her soles and ISAs. 


298 

00:29:24,766 --> 00:29:27,526 

Permission to take 

Mr. Spock as first ofiþer. 


299 

00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,745 

Agreement. 


300 

00:29:38,304 --> 00:29:39,455 

Jim? 


301 

00:29:40,609 --> 00:29:42,333 

- Where were you? 

- For what? 


302 

00:29:42,473 --> 00:29:44,016 

Medical examinations. 


303 

00:29:44,017 --> 00:29:46,010 

10:00 Now, you've been 

by a shootout. 


304 

00:29:46,255 --> 00:29:47,908 

- It's my duty to ... 

- I'm fine, Bones. 


305 

00:29:48,715 --> 00:29:50,373 

Hell! 


306 

00:29:52,093 --> 00:29:53,739 

I'm fine. 


307 

00:29:58,842 --> 00:30:00,486 

Situation report, Mr. Spock. 


308 

00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,685 

Enterprise will be ready for launch 

until our arrival. 


309 

00:30:04,445 --> 00:30:05,710 

Good. 
Thanked. 


310 

00:30:05,711 --> 00:30:06,711 

Captain! 


311 

00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,193 

I thanked that reinstated depending aces. 


312 

00:30:11,425 --> 00:30:12,723 

Welcome. 


313 

00:30:13,726 --> 00:30:15,597 

Since you are and Prime ofiþer, 

it is my duty 


314 

00:30:15,598 --> 00:30:17,573 

I object strongly to 

against mission conditions. 


315 

00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,196 

Bineînþeles. 


316 

00:30:19,197 --> 00:30:22,269 

There are no rules in the navy to condemn 

a man to death without trial. 


317 

00:30:22,608 --> 00:30:24,753 

One thing you 

Admiral Marcus aces and forgotten. 


318 

00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:29,033 

Moreover, preventive launch torpedoes 

Klingon Homeworld by violating ... 


319 

00:30:29,034 --> 00:30:32,226 

You said that the area was uninhabited. 

It'll be one victim. 


320 

00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:35,620 

In case you have not heard, our orders 

Fleet unrelated rules. 


321 

00:30:35,621 --> 00:30:37,789 

Stay least. 
Firing torpedoes 

the Klingons? 


322 

00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:40,206 

With or without rules or action is immoral. 


323 

00:30:40,207 --> 00:30:43,306 

With or without rules, was moral 

to save you from the volcano. 


324 

00:30:43,604 --> 00:30:45,328 

- And this is what I walked. 

- Jim, calm down. 


325 

00:30:45,329 --> 00:30:47,165 

Do not stop to take ethics lecþii 

of the robot. 


326 

00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:49,196 

Resorting to insults suggests 

Aves that a defensive attitude 


327 

00:30:49,197 --> 00:30:50,532 

And that my opinion is correct. 


328 

00:30:50,533 --> 00:30:52,290 

Not asked their opinion. 


329 

00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:54,245 

Bones, get this off my diaper. 


330 

00:30:54,246 --> 00:30:56,652 

Captain, our mission can 

trigger a war with the Klingons. 


331 

00:30:56,653 --> 00:30:58,619 

And by one's self is immoral nature. 


332 

00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:02,437 

Maybe we should will gândiþi 

as to ajungeþi one to this conclusion. 


333 

00:31:03,309 --> 00:31:04,411 

Captain Kirk. 


334 

00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:09,387 

I ofiþerul of scientific Wallace. 
I was 

Enterprise appointed Admiral Marcus. 


335 

00:31:10,185 --> 00:31:12,011 

These are transfer orders. 


336 

00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:14,530 

Asked Aces 

still a ofiþer of scientific, Captain? 


337 

00:31:14,531 --> 00:31:15,978 

I'd like it. 


338 

00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:21,367 

Lt. Carol Wallace 

PhD in Applied Physics, 


339 

00:31:21,368 --> 00:31:24,175 

specialization: advanced weaponry. 


340 

00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:26,170 

- Recommendations impressive. 

- Thanked. 


341 

00:31:26,171 --> 00:31:28,191 

But superfluous now that I'm back 

342 

00:31:28,192 --> 00:31:29,903 

May milked never hurts. 


343 

00:31:29,904 --> 00:31:31,797 

- Sit down, Doctor. 

344 

00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,967 

Prepare yourself for takeoff. 


345 

00:31:58,899 --> 00:32:02,384 

Do not sign anything. 

These demons had on my ship. 


346 

00:32:02,385 --> 00:32:03,845 

- There are problems, Mr. Scott? 


347 

00:32:03,846 --> 00:32:06,173 

I was just explaining to Mr. 


348 

00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:09,891 

they can not accept weapons on board 

without having to know what's inside them. 


349 

00:32:09,892 --> 00:32:12,686 

- Mr. Scott revealed to you a obiecþie ... 

- Report to the bridge. 


350 

00:32:13,303 --> 00:32:14,344 

351 

00:32:14,445 --> 00:32:18,024 

Mr. Scott, understanding their care, but we 

need these torpedoes on board. 


352 

00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,924 

With all due respect, sir, but torpedoes 

Photonic fuel use. 


353 

00:32:20,925 --> 00:32:22,547 

I can not even detect 

what fuel 


354 

00:32:22,548 --> 00:32:25,373 

is in compartments 

torpedoes, because they are shielded. 


355 

00:32:25,685 --> 00:32:28,064 

I asked to see the plans, 

but he told me ... 


356 

00:32:28,223 --> 00:32:29,910 

- Secret. 

- There are secret. 


357 

00:32:29,911 --> 00:32:32,309 

So I said, "I do not see plans 

do not sign anything. " 


358 

00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,310 

Captain. 


359 

00:32:33,924 --> 00:32:35,844 

We completed. 

We are ready to go. 


360 

00:32:35,845 --> 00:32:37,446 

- Thanked Mr. Sulu. 

361 

00:32:37,788 --> 00:32:40,602 

Scuzaþi me, sir, I'm 

to start the warp core. 


362 

00:32:41,504 --> 00:32:42,518 

Get off. 


363 

00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:44,376 

Jim, your vital signs 

not look good. 


364 

00:32:44,377 --> 00:32:45,536 

Report to sickbay. 


365 

00:32:45,537 --> 00:32:46,437 

Scotty! 


366 

00:32:46,615 --> 00:32:48,464 

I want to give approval for weapons. 


367 

00:32:48,465 --> 00:32:51,044 

- And what is this Tisi, Captain? 

- No time for Discus, Scotty. 


368 

00:32:51,045 --> 00:32:53,909 

- I Tisi what is this? 

- Warp core. 


369 

00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:56,572 

It's a radioactive catastrophe 

waiting. 


370 

00:32:57,099 --> 00:32:59,020 

A minor change 

magentic field 


371 

00:32:59,021 --> 00:33:03,088 

caused by the release of several dozen 

The load torpedoes unknown 


372 

00:33:03,465 --> 00:33:06,574 

can trigger the launch of a reacþie 

that will kill the crew. 


373 

00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,584 

Storage torpedoes on board 

Enterprise is the last straw. 


374 

00:33:09,585 --> 00:33:11,326 

- And that was the first drop? 

- What ... 


375 

00:33:11,504 --> 00:33:13,049 

There are a lot of drops. 


376 

00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:16,026 

What ziceþi the fact that the fleet 

I seized ECUAS transwarp? 


377 

00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:18,542 

A fool uses it now 

as to SOPA the galaxy. 


378 

00:33:18,543 --> 00:33:19,786 

How do you think took it? 


379 

00:33:19,787 --> 00:33:22,096 

- We have orders, Scotty. 

- That scares me. 


380 

00:33:23,207 --> 00:33:25,429 

It's a military operas. 


381 

00:33:25,892 --> 00:33:29,005 

That we now? 

I think we're explorers. 


382 

00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:31,682 

Sign up for torpedoes. 
That's an order. 


383 

00:33:33,628 --> 00:33:36,265 

I Keep all other Options 

than to resign depending. 


384 

00:33:36,341 --> 00:33:39,023 

- Come on, Scotty. 

- Do not give your choice, sir. 


385 

00:33:39,024 --> 00:33:41,353 

- I do not give a choice. 

- Not a passive assist ... 


386 

00:33:41,403 --> 00:33:43,525 

I acceptaþi or quit? 


387 

00:33:43,526 --> 00:33:44,526 

388 

00:33:51,408 --> 00:33:52,646 

389 

00:33:54,864 --> 00:33:57,429 

Are you free, Mr. Scott. 


390 

00:34:06,703 --> 00:34:07,728 

Jim. 


391 

00:34:07,982 --> 00:34:11,685 

For God's sake, 

do not use torpedoes. 


392 

00:34:33,289 --> 00:34:36,085 

Captain, I'm sorry 

to Admiral Pike. 


393 

00:34:36,183 --> 00:34:37,363 

We all are. 


394 

00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:40,564 

- We simþiþi right? 

- Yes, thanked, lt. 


395 

00:34:48,509 --> 00:34:50,441 

Scotty just resigned. 


396 

00:34:52,067 --> 00:34:54,947 

And your friend criticize me 

everywhere. 


397 

00:34:58,248 --> 00:34:59,765 

Sorry, I have to say this, 


398 

00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:03,448 

but I wish sometimes 

to extricate them bangs. 


399 

00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:07,731 

- Maybe it's me ... 

- No sunteþi. 


400 

00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,751 

No? 


401 

00:35:12,418 --> 00:35:14,495 

Stay least.


We certaþi? 


402 

00:35:14,496 --> 00:35:15,577 

Rather not talk about it. 


403 

00:35:15,578 --> 00:35:17,474 

Lord, how it be? 


404 

00:35:23,326 --> 00:35:24,702 

You gossip. 


405 

00:35:24,703 --> 00:35:26,085 

Captain on the bridge! 


406 

00:35:26,587 --> 00:35:27,599 

Captain. 


407 

00:35:28,449 --> 00:35:29,602 

Mr. Chekov. 


408 

00:35:30,069 --> 00:35:34,142 

You keep itself after Mr. Scott. 

Engineering know me better? 


409 

00:35:34,143 --> 00:35:35,685 

- Affirmative, sir. 

- Okay. 


410 

00:35:36,819 --> 00:35:39,724 

Are you new chief engineer. 

Put the uniform red. 


411 

00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,965 

Yes, Captain. 


412 

00:35:49,073 --> 00:35:51,051 

Take anchors, Mr. Sulu. 


413 

00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:52,667 

Yes, sir. 


414 

00:36:12,015 --> 00:36:13,864 

Lt. Uhura, open 

a channel for the ship. 


415 

00:36:13,865 --> 00:36:14,865 

416 

00:36:14,926 --> 00:36:16,606 

Mr. Chekov, what's the deal there? 


417 

00:36:16,885 --> 00:36:19,005 

- All systems running, Captain. 

- We understandable. 


418 

00:36:19,106 --> 00:36:21,801 

- We are ready to warp to your order 

- Thanked, Mr. Chekov. 


419 

00:36:22,877 --> 00:36:24,382 

- Okay, let's do it. 

- Yes, sir. 


420 

00:36:38,576 --> 00:36:40,005 

Canal opened, sir. 


421 

00:36:40,734 --> 00:36:42,466 

Warning, the crew of the Enterprise. 


422 

00:36:43,514 --> 00:36:46,993 

So how do you Tisi, Christopher Pike 

former captain of the ship 


423 

00:36:47,214 --> 00:36:49,034 

And our friend 


424 

00:36:50,225 --> 00:36:51,445 

died. 


425 

00:36:52,909 --> 00:36:54,457 

Whoever killed him ran 

of our 


426 

00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:56,134 

And hides 

the Klingon Homeworld. 


427 

00:36:56,135 --> 00:36:58,407 

Believe that we dare 

follow him there. 


428 

00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,172 

But there we go now. 


429 

00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:06,238 

Admiral Marcus ordered to avoid veiling 

with any media to be detectaþi. 


430 

00:37:06,979 --> 00:37:10,104 

Relations between the Federation 

And the Klingon Empire are strained 


431 

00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:12,547 

And any challenge 

can lead to war and Gaza. 


432 

00:37:26,602 --> 00:37:28,346 

I will personally lead 

a team of intervention 


433 

00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:30,845 

in a town abandoned 

on suprafaþa Kronos. 


434 

00:37:31,752 --> 00:37:34,814 

There we will capture fugitive 

John Harrison, 


435 

00:37:35,147 --> 00:37:38,741 

And it will bring the Earth 

to be judged for his actions. 


436 

00:37:42,797 --> 00:37:45,396 

Well, to catch the bastard. 

Kirk finished. 


437 

00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:53,187 

Captain, I would take a good decision. 


438 

00:37:53,842 --> 00:37:57,284 

If you need the help, I'd be happy 

accompanied the team to the intervention. 


439 

00:37:58,367 --> 00:38:00,168 

You happy? 


440 

00:38:00,169 --> 00:38:03,186 

Try using your expressions 

to convey an idea. 


441 

00:38:05,144 --> 00:38:06,626 

Thanked, Mr. Spock. 


442 

00:38:27,527 --> 00:38:29,328 

Spock, you scared me. 


443 

00:38:30,652 --> 00:38:32,111 

What's up, Doc? 


444 

00:38:32,112 --> 00:38:34,328 

- Check the torpedoes ... 

- Did you not understandable. 


445 

00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:36,256 

What are you doing on board? 


446 

00:38:36,357 --> 00:38:38,939 

There is no document confirming 

transfer to the Enterprise. 


447 

00:38:39,312 --> 00:38:42,705 

- Must be a mistake. 

- I agree, Dr. Marcus. 


448 

00:38:44,124 --> 00:38:46,648 

But the identity of privinþa mins in your. 


449 

00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:48,682 

Wallace is your mother's name. 


450 

00:38:49,249 --> 00:38:51,425 

Admiral's suppose your father. 


451 

00:38:55,036 --> 00:38:56,714 

Please, Spock. 


452 

00:38:56,886 --> 00:38:59,393 

I know I have no right 

to ask. 


453 

00:38:59,448 --> 00:39:02,785 

But please ... 

Can not know we're here. 


454 

00:39:10,351 --> 00:39:12,474 

Engineering has stopped 

suddenly warp core, sir. 


455 

00:39:12,579 --> 00:39:14,419 

Mr. Chekov, you ruined my ship? 


456 

00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,047 

Sorry, sir. 
I do not know what happened. 


457 

00:39:16,048 --> 00:39:18,827 

The core was overheating. 

I was forced to stop the emergency. 


458 

00:39:18,828 --> 00:39:21,050 

Must be a fault in the cooling system. 

I need time to find her. 


459 

00:39:21,269 --> 00:39:22,640 

- I'm sorry, Captain. 

- Yes. 


460 

00:39:23,922 --> 00:39:25,884 

Mr. Sulu, while there is 

until destinaþie? 


461 

00:39:26,045 --> 00:39:27,136 

20. 


462 

00:39:27,137 --> 00:39:29,140 

20 minutes into spaces enemy 

they do not predict. 


463 

00:39:29,141 --> 00:39:30,665 

Then hurry. 


464 

00:39:30,939 --> 00:39:32,546 

- Where is Spock? 

- I'm here, Captain. 


465 

00:39:32,945 --> 00:39:34,804 

Come with me on Kronos. 


466 

00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:37,261 

- Lieutenant, how's Klingon language? 

- I've never practiced it, but I got it. 


467 

00:39:37,262 --> 00:39:38,603 

Okay, and you live. 


468 

00:39:39,295 --> 00:39:41,515 

Do I expect problems 

the two of you working together? 


469 

00:39:41,516 --> 00:39:42,716 

Absolutely not. 


470 

00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:47,747 

Uncertain. 


471 

00:39:47,848 --> 00:39:49,678 

We meet in hangar. 


472 

00:39:50,286 --> 00:39:52,403 

Jim, just will not dispose there 

is not it? 


473 

00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:55,459 

Do you rob a bank machine 

which has a run flat tire. 


474 

00:39:57,316 --> 00:39:59,272 

I'm sure Engineering 

'll finish repairs 


475 

00:39:59,273 --> 00:40:00,547 

until we get back. 


476 

00:40:00,548 --> 00:40:01,730 

Right, Mr. Chekov? 


477 

00:40:02,246 --> 00:40:03,449 

478 

00:40:03,644 --> 00:40:05,589 

I'll do my best. 


479 

00:40:06,581 --> 00:40:08,857 

Mr. Sulu, take over. 


480 

00:40:09,269 --> 00:40:13,091 

When you leave, I was sent 

a message to Harrison's position. 


481 

00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:15,844 

Tell him you have some massive torpedos 

ASINT directly to him 


482 

00:40:15,845 --> 00:40:17,789 

If you oppose Resistance 

And is not afraid to uses you. 


483 

00:40:18,899 --> 00:40:20,708 

- Is there a problem? 

- No, sir. 


484 

00:40:21,025 --> 00:40:23,135 

But we were never 

in the captain's chair. 


485 

00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,463 

You're fine. 


486 

00:40:27,171 --> 00:40:28,516 

Jim, wait. 


487 

00:40:28,947 --> 00:40:31,265 

You just put 

In a game of huge stakes poker 


488 

00:40:31,266 --> 00:40:33,312 

Without a good book 

Like to play the bluff. 


489 

00:40:33,451 --> 00:40:35,641 

Sulu is a good man, 

but he has cloth captain. 


490 

00:40:35,882 --> 00:40:38,488 

You'll have the following 

two hours. 
Now stop with the metaphors. 


491 

00:40:38,543 --> 00:40:39,630 

That's an order. 


492 

00:40:39,631 --> 00:40:42,045 

Mr. Sulu, make sure that the ship 

k'normianã is ready to fly. 


493 

00:40:51,609 --> 00:40:53,669 

Provisional Captain Sulu 

by Hangar 2. 


494 

00:40:54,256 --> 00:40:57,349 

I want merchantman captured 

the incident last month Mudd 


495 

00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:58,730 

to be fueled and ready to fly. 


496 

00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,692 

Captain Kirk is headed 

right now on it. 


497 

00:41:04,335 --> 00:41:06,034 

Ready for action, Captain. 


498 

00:41:06,035 --> 00:41:07,601 

Renunþaþi in red uniforms. 


499 

00:41:07,602 --> 00:41:10,016 

Sunteþi traficanþi k'normieni weapons. 

Îmbrãcaþi yourself with this. 


500 

00:41:10,831 --> 00:41:13,880 

If operaþiunea is compromised, the involvement 

Fleet must remain a secret. 


501 

00:41:13,881 --> 00:41:16,381 

Unless you want to switch on your 

a war, Mr. Hendorff. 


502 

00:41:16,578 --> 00:41:18,488 

- No, sir. 

503 

00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:19,389 

Good. 
Neither do I. 


504 

00:41:37,604 --> 00:41:40,457 

Detecting a single sign of vias 

Keth Province. 


505 

00:41:40,829 --> 00:41:42,711 

Given the information 

offered by Mr. Scott, 


506 

00:41:42,712 --> 00:41:44,577 

is likely 

be John Harrison. 


507 

00:41:44,578 --> 00:41:47,304 

Mr. Sulu, I found the guy. 

Announced that it no joke. 


508 

00:41:47,488 --> 00:41:48,616 

509 

00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:52,110 

Warning, John Harrison. 


510 

00:41:52,764 --> 00:41:55,644 

Here Captain Hikaru Sulu 

of the USS Enterprise. 


511 

00:41:56,765 --> 00:42:00,045 

A shuttle to the elite ofiþeri 

is heading to your position. 


512 

00:42:00,992 --> 00:42:03,323 

If they do not surrender immediately 


513 

00:42:03,324 --> 00:42:07,539 

launched an all cargo 

advanced long range torpedo 


514 

00:42:07,713 --> 00:42:10,014 

ASINT to your position. 


515 

00:42:10,534 --> 00:42:13,064 

You have two minutes to confirm 

that you comply. 


516 

00:42:13,691 --> 00:42:17,179 

Refusal will result 

consequence your annihilation. 


517 

00:42:18,449 --> 00:42:20,628 

If you put me to the test, 

a to e and uezi. 


518 

00:42:26,356 --> 00:42:27,492 

Mr. Sulu. 


519 

00:42:27,955 --> 00:42:30,129 

Remind me never to get on your nerves. 


520 

00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:35,375 

I Kronos </ i> 


521 

00:42:35,476 --> 00:42:38,235 

We arrive at Harrison's position 

three minutes, Captain. 


522 

00:42:38,546 --> 00:42:40,430 

It's unlikely to come willingly. 


523 

00:42:40,431 --> 00:42:44,302 

Estimated as the opportunity to try 

to kill us it's 91.6%. 


524 

00:42:44,392 --> 00:42:45,201 

Fantastic. 


525 

00:42:45,302 --> 00:42:47,034 

Well that does not care about death. 


526 

00:42:49,091 --> 00:42:50,890 

Sorry, lt. 
I hear you ... 


527 

00:42:50,891 --> 00:42:52,152 

I said nothing. 


528 

00:42:54,361 --> 00:42:56,510 

So much talk and well 

If you stay I asculþi. 


529 

00:42:56,511 --> 00:42:58,413 

- BAIES .... 

- I'd rather discuss in private. 


530 

00:42:58,414 --> 00:43:00,172 

You prefer not to talk at all. 


531 

00:43:00,173 --> 00:43:02,344 

- Our plans ... 

- You do not începeþi now? 


532 

00:43:02,345 --> 00:43:04,180 

You never time. 


533 

00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:06,204 

I'm sorry, Captain. 
Only two seconds. 


534 

00:43:06,764 --> 00:43:09,634 

When the volcano were not you thought 

not to us 


535 

00:43:09,635 --> 00:43:11,565 

about how I'd be affected 

If you die, Spock. 


536 

00:43:13,188 --> 00:43:16,535 

You SIMS anything. 
He did not care. 


537 

00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,219 

And not only upset 

on you. 
And the captain's 


538 

00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,174 

I'm not in the middle bagasse. 


539 

00:43:24,386 --> 00:43:25,479 

He's right. 


540 

00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,303 

Afirmaþia I do not care 

Death is not correct. 


541 

00:43:28,928 --> 00:43:31,683 

The chance optimum aware fiinþelor 

to maximize efficiency and 


542 

00:43:31,743 --> 00:43:33,075 

is a Vias long and prosper. 


543 

00:43:33,076 --> 00:43:35,544 

- Great. 

- It sounds like a song of love, Spock. 


544 

00:43:35,545 --> 00:43:37,188 

Did not understandable aces. 


545 

00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:40,314 

It's true that we have chosen 

do not feel anything 


546 

00:43:40,315 --> 00:43:42,964 

when I realized 

that my life of approaching end. 


547 

00:43:44,428 --> 00:43:47,903 

When Admiral Pike died 

I researched a science con. 


548 

00:43:48,009 --> 00:43:51,086 

I lived that moment morþii Sims him. 


549 

00:43:52,366 --> 00:43:55,618 

Anger, confusion, loneliness. 


550 

00:43:57,085 --> 00:43:58,375 

Fear. 


551 

00:43:58,946 --> 00:44:01,375 

May had experienced these feelings 

And before 


552 

00:44:02,409 --> 00:44:06,143 

a thousand times more powerful 

the day my world was destroyed. 


553 

00:44:08,277 --> 00:44:11,769 

I chose to stop living 

ever these feelings. 


554 

00:44:15,035 --> 00:44:17,614 

Nyota, confusing my choice 

SIMS not 


555 

00:44:18,687 --> 00:44:20,929 

with an expression of indifference. 


556 

00:44:21,609 --> 00:44:25,058 

But I assure you that the truth 

exactly the opposite. 


557 

00:44:31,882 --> 00:44:32,911 

What the hell was that? 


558 

00:44:33,894 --> 00:44:35,136 

What is happening? 
What step signal? 


559 

00:44:35,137 --> 00:44:37,151 

We interrupted. 
Try 

to reconnect. 


560 

00:44:40,913 --> 00:44:43,655 

We urmãriþi of a ship 

Klingon D4 class. 


561 

00:44:43,756 --> 00:44:46,088 

- I think it's an area abandoned. 

- Is it just a routine patrol. 


562 

00:44:46,189 --> 00:44:47,686 

Hold on tight. 


563 

00:44:51,226 --> 00:44:52,779 

Our ship has 

capacitãþi offensive. 


564 

00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,632 

He's got us. 

Engines within. 


565 

00:44:54,633 --> 00:44:55,633 

566 

00:45:09,717 --> 00:45:10,763 

Damn. 


567 

00:45:13,149 --> 00:45:15,148 

Is fast approaching. 
285 direction. 


568 

00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,398 

We can get rid of them there. 


569 

00:45:21,147 --> 00:45:23,993 

Sugeraþi use passage 

of buildings in the bud. 


570 

00:45:23,994 --> 00:45:25,365 

- The ship would fit. 

- It fits. 


571 

00:45:25,366 --> 00:45:28,259 

- Captain, would fit. 

- No room. 
Room! 


572 

00:45:46,637 --> 00:45:47,722 

And I said that room. 


573 

00:45:47,723 --> 00:45:49,329 

Not a good example. 


574 

00:45:52,967 --> 00:45:55,268 

- I never tracked? 

- No. 
That worries me. 


575 

00:45:55,369 --> 00:45:57,281 

- I got rid of them. 

- Or we jamming sensors. 


576 

00:45:57,282 --> 00:45:58,282 

Or we get rid of them. 


577 

00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,475 

We are ordered to land. 


578 

00:46:20,852 --> 00:46:22,883 

Captain, they want to know 

why I came here. 


579 

00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:26,264 

I'll torture us, 

a question to us, 


580 

00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:28,268 

And then kill us. 


581 

00:46:31,156 --> 00:46:32,450 

So come out with gun in hand. 


582 

00:46:35,891 --> 00:46:37,964 

We are overwhelmed Armoured numerically 

înarmaþi weak. 


583 

00:46:38,831 --> 00:46:41,404 

We die Tosi 

If you attack first. 


584 

00:46:43,436 --> 00:46:45,589 

I got aces and me 

Because speaking Klingon. 


585 

00:46:46,665 --> 00:46:48,703 

Leave the talking to me. 


586 

00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:38,555 

I'll go. 


587 

00:47:38,705 --> 00:47:40,545 

It's only logical Options. 


588 

00:47:40,601 --> 00:47:43,550 

If an interrupt now 

you will not only angry Klingons 


589 

00:47:43,876 --> 00:47:46,134 

but also on lt. 
Uhura. 


590 

00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,607 

We're here to help. 


591 

00:48:18,511 --> 00:48:20,261 

- Lieutenant. 

- Thanked, Captain. 


592 

00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,006 

Looking for a killer. 


593 

00:48:30,976 --> 00:48:35,462 

It hides the ruins them. 


594 

00:48:35,724 --> 00:48:38,500 

He killed people milking. 


595 

00:48:51,811 --> 00:48:55,253 

Why should I care about a man 

Al and that kills people? 


596 

00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:59,127 

Because I Hold the honor. 


597 

00:48:59,784 --> 00:49:02,944 

He has no honor. 


598 

00:49:03,765 --> 00:49:06,547 

You and your peers 

sunteþi in danger. 


599 

00:51:28,766 --> 00:51:30,272 

- Lower weapon! 

- How many torpedoes? 


600 

00:51:30,273 --> 00:51:31,273 

Lower your weapon! 


601 

00:51:32,158 --> 00:51:36,162 

Torpedoes! 
Weapons threatens me with aces 

in your message. 
How many? 


602 

00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:40,317 

72. 


603 

00:51:46,653 --> 00:51:48,175 

I surrender. 


604 

00:52:04,868 --> 00:52:08,363 

In the name of Christopher Pike 

my friend 


605 

00:52:09,144 --> 00:52:10,939 

accept their surrender. 


606 

00:52:35,314 --> 00:52:36,510 

Captain! 


607 

00:52:45,504 --> 00:52:47,202 

608 

00:52:58,745 --> 00:53:00,108 

Put the handcuffs. 


609 

00:53:19,846 --> 00:53:22,226 

- Bones, come in the area of ??detention. 

- Immediately. 


610 

00:53:22,724 --> 00:53:25,246 

Lt, contact Starfleet. 


611 

00:53:25,247 --> 00:53:27,079 

I announced that we got Harrison 

in custody 


612 

00:53:28,088 --> 00:53:30,244 

And that we leave immediately 

're done repairs to the warp core. 


613 

00:53:30,245 --> 00:53:31,245 

614 

00:53:48,377 --> 00:53:50,278 

- Why the hell did he teach? 

- Do not know. 


615 

00:53:50,279 --> 00:53:52,327 

A shattered one 

a detachment of Klingons. 


616 

00:53:52,419 --> 00:53:53,419 

I want to know how. 


617 

00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:55,328 

Looks like we have a Superman board. 


618 

00:53:56,017 --> 00:53:57,340 

You tell me. 


619 

00:54:04,896 --> 00:54:08,023 

Get Bras through openings. 

Her to take a blood sample. 


620 

00:54:22,144 --> 00:54:24,513 

Why not move, Captain? 


621 

00:54:26,412 --> 00:54:29,452 

Somehow a fault unexpected 

the warp core 


622 

00:54:29,453 --> 00:54:32,463 

that you accidentally left the floating 

the edge of space Klingon? 


623 

00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:34,792 

- How the hell do you know that? 

- Bones. 


624 

00:54:35,134 --> 00:54:38,514 

You will find that Desin 

pression information, Captain. 


625 

00:54:41,096 --> 00:54:43,115 

- Have you finished? 

626 

00:54:43,264 --> 00:54:44,858 

Tell me what you have learned. 


627 

00:54:45,942 --> 00:54:49,687 

If I ignore it, Tosi those 

the ship will die. 


628 

00:54:56,039 --> 00:54:58,919 

Captain, will try 

only manipulate you. 


629 

00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:01,559 

I do not recommend 

Let interacþionaþi with deþinutul. 


630 

00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,102 

Give me a minute. 


631 

00:55:15,409 --> 00:55:17,496 

Come to explain the situation. 


632 

00:55:18,037 --> 00:55:20,177 

You're a criminal. 


633 

00:55:20,303 --> 00:55:22,666 

I saw you killed 

nevinovaþi people. 


634 

00:55:22,667 --> 00:55:24,946 

We received the authorization to get liquid. 


635 

00:55:25,677 --> 00:55:30,677 

Are you still in the ViaSat ago 

Just because I allow such a thing. 


636 

00:55:30,889 --> 00:55:33,724 

So shut up. 


637 

00:55:34,305 --> 00:55:38,089 

Captain, you're going 

and let me love you once and once again 


638 

00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:39,390 

Up Bras hurt? 


639 

00:55:39,391 --> 00:55:41,544 

It is clear that you want. 

Then tell me. 


640 

00:55:43,222 --> 00:55:46,628 

- Why did you afford to live? 

- We take Tosi mistakes. 


641 

00:55:48,149 --> 00:55:49,543 

I handed strand because 


642 

00:55:49,544 --> 00:55:51,901 

despite your attempts 

to convince me of the opposite 


643 

00:55:51,902 --> 00:55:54,726 

It seems you have a con a science, Mr. Kirk. 


644 

00:55:56,302 --> 00:56:00,286 

If you did not have, I would be impossible 

tell yourself the truth. 


645 

00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:06,393 

23 ... 
17 ... 
46 ... 
11. 


646 

00:56:07,436 --> 00:56:09,725 

Coordinates not far from Earth. 


647 

00:56:09,737 --> 00:56:13,012 

If you want to know 

why I committed those acts, 


648 

00:56:13,665 --> 00:56:15,316 

Go and take a look. 


649 

00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:17,621 

Give me one reason 

which you and listen. 


650 

00:56:17,622 --> 00:56:19,690 

Can they figure 72. 


651 

00:56:20,374 --> 00:56:22,926 

I'm on board your ship, Captain. 


652 

00:56:24,157 --> 00:56:26,737 

That's always been. 


653 

00:56:27,282 --> 00:56:30,021 

They suggest you open a torpedo. 


654 

00:56:55,507 --> 00:56:57,533 

You know what bothers me? 


655 

00:56:58,034 --> 00:57:01,112 

Changes, Improvements. 


656 

00:57:01,367 --> 00:57:03,468 

And so I flew here on the ship. 


657 

00:57:03,633 --> 00:57:05,512 

Just because I tried 

to do the right thing. 


658 

00:57:06,913 --> 00:57:10,287 

And what do you do? 

State and look at me as a clam. 


659 

00:57:11,134 --> 00:57:12,752 

- What? 

- Scotty, are Kirk. 


660 

00:57:14,864 --> 00:57:18,175 

Taman Captain James Tiberius 

Perfect Hair. 


661 

00:57:18,176 --> 00:57:19,930 

Have you heard? 
I said perfect hair. 


662 

00:57:19,931 --> 00:57:21,811 

- Where are you? 

- But where are you? 


663 

00:57:22,028 --> 00:57:23,065 

Are you drunk? 


664 

00:57:23,066 --> 00:57:25,828 

It's my business what I do 

free time, Jim. 


665 

00:57:25,935 --> 00:57:27,284 

I need your help. 


666 

00:57:27,285 --> 00:57:31,843 

Possible to record these coordinates: 

23, 17, 46, 11? 


667 

00:57:33,108 --> 00:57:35,788 

- You write? 

- You think I do not remember four numbers and N? 


668 

00:57:36,785 --> 00:57:38,580 

Do not trust me. 


669 

00:57:39,194 --> 00:57:41,753 

- What was the third? 

- 46. 


670 

00:57:42,489 --> 00:57:44,648 

I do not know what to clamp 


671 

00:57:45,987 --> 00:57:48,130 

but I think 

Know that one when I see it. 


672 

00:57:49,323 --> 00:57:51,299 

I think you were right 

in privinþa torpedoes. 


673 

00:57:53,295 --> 00:57:57,151 

I take that as an excuse. 

I think about it. 


674 

00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:00,807 

- You quit. 

- You've forced! 


675 

00:58:01,888 --> 00:58:04,484 

Mr. Scott! 
Scotty! 


676 

00:58:06,651 --> 00:58:08,230 

I arrived. 


677 

00:58:09,888 --> 00:58:12,175 

I'll do him no favor. 


678 

00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:14,547 

No! 


679 

00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:16,135 

Very well. 


680 

00:58:16,512 --> 00:58:18,337 

You þicnit all? 


681 

00:58:18,338 --> 00:58:20,291 

You're not going to asculþi 

this guy. 


682 

00:58:20,292 --> 00:58:22,267 

Pike killed him, 

was to kill you and you, 


683 

00:58:22,268 --> 00:58:25,859 

And now think it's a good idea to open 

Because a torpedo so and told him? 


684 

00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:28,091 

What saved the life of us, Bones? 


685 

00:58:28,092 --> 00:58:29,660 

Doctor's right, Captain. 


686 

00:58:29,661 --> 00:58:32,140 

I do not approve, Spock. 
I feel uncomfortable. 


687 

00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:34,820 

Should you invest and 

to control of emotions, Doc. 


688 

00:58:35,234 --> 00:58:37,212 

- In this situation, logic dictates ... 

- Logic! 


689 

00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:40,373 

A maniac trying to make us 

Let us alone in the air 


690 

00:58:40,374 --> 00:58:41,374 

And you all talk ... 


691 

00:58:41,375 --> 00:58:43,330 

I do not know what to teach, 

But that's the reason. 


692 

00:58:43,968 --> 00:58:46,216 

I'll open a torpedo. 

The question is how? 


693 

00:58:46,217 --> 00:58:49,164 

Jim, without Mr. Scott on board 

Who's ready 


694 

00:58:49,165 --> 00:58:51,675 

to dismantle 

four tons of explosives? 


695 

00:58:51,676 --> 00:58:55,444 

Daughter of Admiral's interesting 

torpedo and is skilled in weapons. 


696 

00:58:55,906 --> 00:58:57,528 

Maybe we can help it. 


697 

00:58:58,130 --> 00:58:59,661 

Daughter of Admiral? 


698 

00:58:59,662 --> 00:59:01,105 

Carol Marcus. 


699 

00:59:01,106 --> 00:59:04,074 

New ofiþer of scientific climbed the ship 

with a false identity. 


700 

00:59:04,695 --> 00:59:05,842 

And when were you going to tell me? 


701 

00:59:05,843 --> 00:59:08,374 

When it became relevant. 

Just got. 


702 

00:59:09,028 --> 00:59:10,545 

Torpedoes in the hold weapons? 


703 

00:59:10,546 --> 00:59:12,447 

Charged and ready for launch. 
What are they? 


704 

00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:14,964 

I do not know. 
So I transferred 

your ship as you know. 


705 

00:59:14,965 --> 00:59:16,768 

I apologize for that. 


706 

00:59:16,869 --> 00:59:19,303 

If you had problems because my 

sorry. 


707 

00:59:19,865 --> 00:59:22,101 

- I'm Carol Marcus. 

- James Kirk. 


708 

00:59:22,102 --> 00:59:23,102 

Torpedoes! 


709 

00:59:24,035 --> 00:59:26,571 

My dad gave me access 

all weapons programs. 


710 

00:59:26,572 --> 00:59:29,095 

Then I heard that handles 

The design of torpedo us. 


711 

00:59:29,377 --> 00:59:32,259 

When I went to ask for explanations, 

did not even want to see me. 


712 

00:59:33,286 --> 00:59:36,592 

Then I discovered that photons 

had disappeared from official documents. 


713 

00:59:37,886 --> 00:59:39,195 

I gave them to me. 


714 

00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:42,243 

Are you smarter than suggested 

the reputation you, Captain Kirk. 


715 

00:59:42,688 --> 00:59:43,729 

I have the reputation? 


716 

00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:45,944 

Yes, we are friends 

Christine Chapel. 


717 

00:59:47,276 --> 00:59:48,526 

Christine, yes. 
How is she? 


718 

00:59:48,527 --> 00:59:50,583 

It was transferred as a nurse 

outer border. 


719 

00:59:50,584 --> 00:59:52,814 

- I like it better there. 

- Very good. 


720 

00:59:53,168 --> 00:59:55,580 

You have no idea who I'm talking about, 

721 

00:59:56,446 --> 00:59:57,510 

What are we doing here? 


722 

00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:59,244 

- Shuttle is ready to fly? 

- Of course. 


723 

00:59:59,417 --> 01:00:01,374 

- Come back, please. 

- Why? 


724 

01:00:02,259 --> 01:00:04,083 

Come back. 


725 

01:00:04,908 --> 01:00:08,992 

It's too dangerous to try 

to open a torpedo Enterprise. 


726 

01:00:09,209 --> 01:00:13,149 

But there is a nearby planetoid. 

Can I open one there. 


727 

01:00:13,427 --> 01:00:15,055 

But I'm gonna need help ... 


728 

01:00:15,908 --> 01:00:17,566 

729 

01:00:18,526 --> 01:00:19,689 

Now! 


730 

01:00:21,193 --> 01:00:22,325 

Captain on the bridge. 


731 

01:00:22,927 --> 01:00:26,900 

Mr. Sulu, Drs Marcus 

McCoy and landed on the planetoid? 


732 

01:00:27,053 --> 01:00:29,807 

Yes, sir. 
Right now prepare torpedo. 


733 

01:00:30,024 --> 01:00:32,085 

Activity Detected Klingon? 


734 

01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:35,912 

Not yet, but if I stay 

time here, we will find it. 


735 

01:00:36,528 --> 01:00:39,480 

Lt. Uhura, have announced fleet 

I got that Harrison? 


736 

01:00:39,642 --> 01:00:42,293 

I received no reply. 


737 

01:00:43,061 --> 01:00:46,747 

Engineering to bridge. 

Captain, I heard? 


738 

01:00:46,748 --> 01:00:48,704 

Mr. Chekov, give me some good news. 


739 

01:00:49,135 --> 01:00:52,608 

I found fault, sir, 

but damage is important. 


740 

01:00:52,609 --> 01:00:54,631 

- Fix them now. 

- You know what was the cause? 


741 

01:00:55,721 --> 01:00:59,412 

No, sir. 
But I take responsibility. 


742 

01:01:01,035 --> 01:01:03,118 

Something tells me that was not your fault. 


743 

01:01:03,791 --> 01:01:04,943 

Continue repairs. 


744 

01:01:04,944 --> 01:01:06,998 

The shuttle is the reception hall, Captain. 


745 

01:01:07,915 --> 01:01:09,375 

Bones, that we thanked adjustments. 


746 

01:01:09,376 --> 01:01:11,735 

Dr. Marcus will need 

The best hands on the ship. 


747 

01:01:11,844 --> 01:01:15,408 

When I dreamed of a planet 

Abandoned alongside a gorgeous woman, 


748 

01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:17,067 

there was no torpedo. 


749 

01:01:17,068 --> 01:01:19,669 

Dr. McCoy, they remember 

that you're not there to flirt. 


750 

01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:22,418 

How can I help hands 

My legendary Dr. Marcus? 


751 

01:01:23,524 --> 01:01:26,620 

To see how strong 

these weapons must open warhead. 


752 

01:01:26,621 --> 01:01:28,397 

This requires to access 

fuel compartment. 


753 

01:01:28,398 --> 01:01:31,854 

Unfortunately for us, 

torpedo warhead's a little unstable. 


754 

01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:35,732 

Honey, I did once a cesarean 

the emergency on a female Gorn. 


755 

01:01:35,795 --> 01:01:38,752 

Eight children. 
And micuþii 

ã knew know how to bite. 


756 

01:01:39,172 --> 01:01:41,625 

I think I got your rocket. 


757 

01:01:41,852 --> 01:01:45,973 

Dr. McCoy, is a bundle 

fiber cable on the inner wrapper. 


758 

01:01:46,183 --> 01:01:50,367 

You have to cut the 23th thread down. 

Whatever you do, do not touch anything else. 


759 

01:01:50,368 --> 01:01:53,317 

- You understandable? 

- Yes. 
I do not even think of. 


760 

01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,778 

Dr. McCoy, wait for my signal. 


761 

01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:58,261 

Reprogram processor detonation. 


762 

01:01:58,807 --> 01:02:00,614 

- Are you ready? 

- And yet how. 


763 

01:02:00,664 --> 01:02:01,793 

Success. 


764 

01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:05,972 

- Sir, torpedo was armed. 

- Warhead will explode in 30 seconds. 


765 

01:02:05,973 --> 01:02:08,263 

What the hell happened? 

I can not get my BRAS. 


766 

01:02:08,264 --> 01:02:10,645 

Fixaþi signal them 

And teleportaþi them back now. 


767 

01:02:10,646 --> 01:02:13,636 

Conveyor not know how to distinguish it 

Dr. McCoy torpedo. 


768 

01:02:14,143 --> 01:02:15,877 

We can not teleport separately. 


769 

01:02:15,878 --> 01:02:19,358 

- Dr. Marcus, a possible disarm? 

- Trying. 


770 

01:02:20,282 --> 01:02:21,930 

- Jim Beam it here. 

- No. 


771 

01:02:21,931 --> 01:02:24,897 

If I teleport, he dies. 

Let me do it. 


772 

01:02:25,405 --> 01:02:28,090 

10, 9, 8 .. 


773 

01:02:28,276 --> 01:02:31,252 

We are ready to teleport a 

Dr. Marcus to your order, sir. 


774 

01:02:31,446 --> 01:02:33,206 

4, 3 ... 


775 

01:02:33,307 --> 01:02:34,307 

Shit! 


776 

01:02:39,185 --> 01:02:41,149 

Torpedoed off, Captain. 


777 

01:02:43,668 --> 01:02:45,128 

Dr. McCoy, are you okay? 


778 

01:02:50,162 --> 01:02:51,234 

Bones. 


779 

01:02:52,521 --> 01:02:53,867 

Jim? 


780 

01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:57,164 

You need to see this. 


781 

01:03:05,382 --> 01:03:09,144 

I Coordinates 23.17.46.11 

Jupiter </ i> 


782 

01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:05,107 

Reduce speed propellers 

Approaching the bud. 


783 

01:04:06,577 --> 01:04:10,605 

USS Vengeance, the crew requested Punþii 

entrance to the hangar construction. 


784 

01:04:12,664 --> 01:04:14,898 

Aves permission to intrasite the hangar. 


785 

01:04:23,114 --> 01:04:26,640 

I need a team 

Welding in one basket. 


786 

01:04:30,461 --> 01:04:31,919 

Damn ... 


787 

01:04:33,908 --> 01:04:35,667 

- What aces found? 

- A ciudãþenie. 


788 

01:04:35,668 --> 01:04:38,790 

Fuel compartment 

was removed and modified torpedo 


789 

01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:40,367 

cryotube to hide this. 


790 

01:04:42,723 --> 01:04:44,432 

- Is he alive? 

791 

01:04:44,829 --> 01:04:47,527 

But if you try to wake him 

without an appropriate procedure, 


792 

01:04:47,528 --> 01:04:48,624 

could die. 


793 

01:04:49,066 --> 01:04:51,019 

This technology overcomes me up. 


794 

01:04:51,133 --> 01:04:53,655 

- How far is it, Doc? 

- No advance. 


795 

01:04:53,836 --> 01:04:55,485 

Cryotube is ancient. 


796 

01:04:55,852 --> 01:04:57,027 

I was no need to hustle 

anyone 


797 

01:04:57,028 --> 01:04:58,587 

since I discovered warp drive. 


798 

01:04:58,588 --> 01:05:02,109 

Which explains the most interesting 

aspect of our friend. 


799 

01:05:03,179 --> 01:05:05,319 

Is 300 years. 


800 

01:05:13,235 --> 01:05:15,356 

Why is a man torpedo? 


801 

01:05:15,944 --> 01:05:20,690 

There are people in all torpedoes, 

captain.



I put myself there. 


802 

01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:25,585 

Who the hell are you? 


803 

01:05:29,686 --> 01:05:32,066 

Vestige of bygone times. 


804 

01:05:33,048 --> 01:05:35,160 

Genetically modified to be superior 


805 

01:05:35,161 --> 01:05:38,366 

as to lead the ALSI to peace 

in a world crushed by wars. 


806 

01:05:39,334 --> 01:05:44,264 

But I was condamnaþi as you some criminals 

obliged to exile we take. 


807 

01:05:45,632 --> 01:05:47,929 

I slept for centuries, 


808 

01:05:48,429 --> 01:05:52,020 

hoping that things 

will be different when we wake up. 


809 

01:05:52,790 --> 01:05:55,142 

But due to the destruction of Vulcan, 


810 

01:05:55,143 --> 01:05:58,664 

Your fleet began to investigate 

frenetic remote sector of space. 


811 

01:05:58,665 --> 01:06:01,664 

My ship was found 

drift. 
But I was awake. 


812 

01:06:01,665 --> 01:06:05,020 

We sought information about John Harrison. 

Until a year ago did not exist. 


813 

01:06:05,021 --> 01:06:09,780 

John Harrison was an illusion created 

when I was awakened by Admiral Marcus 


814 

01:06:09,781 --> 01:06:11,771 

as to help him in his plans. 


815 

01:06:12,224 --> 01:06:15,225 

A firewall designed 

I hide my true identity. 


816 

01:06:16,438 --> 01:06:20,342 

My name is Khan. 


817 

01:06:25,125 --> 01:06:28,455 

Why would an admiral for help 


818 

01:06:28,456 --> 01:06:31,732 

a man frozen for 300 years? 


819 

01:06:31,767 --> 01:06:34,646 

Because I'm better. 


820 

01:06:34,784 --> 01:06:36,891 

- What? 

- At all. 


821 

01:06:38,815 --> 01:06:41,573 

Alexander Marcus had to respond 

a threat uncivilized 


822 

01:06:41,574 --> 01:06:42,574 

in civilized times. 


823 

01:06:42,575 --> 01:06:45,000 

Therefore need 

the mind of a warrior, 


824 

01:06:45,285 --> 01:06:46,845 

my mind 


825 

01:06:46,846 --> 01:06:49,013 

to design 

weapons and warships. 


826 

01:06:49,014 --> 01:06:52,984 

Admiral suggested that violated all 

rules sworn to observe 


827 

01:06:52,985 --> 01:06:55,009 

just because he wanted 

to exploit the intellect? 


828 

01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:57,284 

I wanted to exploit cruelty. 


829 

01:06:57,843 --> 01:07:00,428 

Intellect is not enough to fight, 

Mr. Spock. 


830 

01:07:00,429 --> 01:07:05,179 

# Do not even step a possible rule 

How would you like to step over dead bodies? 


831 

01:07:05,967 --> 01:07:08,381 

Marcus I used 

as weapons design, 


832 

01:07:08,543 --> 01:07:11,543 

that helped him accomplish and 

dream of a militarized Fleets. 


833 

01:07:11,872 --> 01:07:14,587 

I sent you 

you uses your weapons. 


834 

01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:18,623 

My torpedoes launched 

secretly against a planet. 


835 

01:07:19,699 --> 01:07:23,200 

And then he sabotaged the ship 

like to stay in enemy space, 


836 

01:07:23,201 --> 01:07:25,963 

easy mark 

an inevitable consequences. 


837 

01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:29,634 

Klingons were 

to seek the offender, 


838 

01:07:29,635 --> 01:07:31,577 

And you have not had 

any chance of escape. 


839 

01:07:31,884 --> 01:07:36,603 

Marcus would take part 

The war was talking about. 


840 

01:07:36,604 --> 01:07:38,477 

War you wanted. 


841 

01:07:38,861 --> 01:07:40,669 

No. 


842 

01:07:41,689 --> 01:07:43,731 

I saw opening fire 

on a room 


843 

01:07:43,732 --> 01:07:45,845 

neînarmaþi ofiþeri filled. 


844 

01:07:45,846 --> 01:07:47,536 

You killed in cold blood! 


845 

01:07:47,537 --> 01:07:50,021 

Marcus took my crew. 


846 

01:07:50,022 --> 01:07:51,632 

You're a criminal! 


847 

01:07:51,633 --> 01:07:55,064 

She used friends 

that to control me. 


848 

01:07:59,504 --> 01:08:01,864 

I tried to take them in a safe place 


849 

01:08:01,865 --> 01:08:04,869 

hiding them in weapons 

they project. 


850 

01:08:07,394 --> 01:08:08,919 

But I was found. 


851 

01:08:10,527 --> 01:08:14,419 

I had no choice. 
I ran alone. 


852 

01:08:15,823 --> 01:08:19,910 

And when I ran, I 

every reason to believe 


853 

01:08:19,911 --> 01:08:24,213 

Marcus that I killed those Tosi 


854 

01:08:24,248 --> 01:08:27,561 

which itself most. 


855 

01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:34,298 

I replied with the same currency. 


856 

01:08:38,313 --> 01:08:42,300 

My crew is my family, Kirk. 


857 

01:08:43,017 --> 01:08:46,805 

You did not do anything 

for your family? 


858 

01:08:49,055 --> 01:08:50,259 

Proximity alert, sir. 


859 

01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:52,085 

A ship coming towards us at warp speed. 


860 

01:08:52,186 --> 01:08:53,859 

- Klingons? 

- The warp? 


861 

01:08:54,055 --> 01:08:57,111 

No, Kirk. 
We both know who it is 


862 

01:08:57,112 --> 01:08:59,700 

I think not. 
Not coming from the direction of Kronos. 


863 

01:09:05,131 --> 01:09:08,125 

Lt, take him to the infirmary Khan. 

Be preserved for six ofiþeri security. 


864 

01:09:08,126 --> 01:09:09,193 

Yes, Captain. 


865 

01:09:09,294 --> 01:09:10,720 

Captain on the bridge. 


866 

01:09:11,589 --> 01:09:14,216 

- How long get here? 

- Over three seconds, sir. 


867 

01:09:16,308 --> 01:09:17,739 

- Shields. 

- Yes, Captain. 


868 

01:09:42,618 --> 01:09:44,225 

Hailing us, sir. 


869 

01:09:44,815 --> 01:09:46,696 

On screen. 


870 

01:09:47,247 --> 01:09:49,233 

Transmitted throughout the ship. 


871 

01:09:53,777 --> 01:09:55,047 

Captain Kirk. 


872 

01:09:56,584 --> 01:09:58,807 

Admiral Marcus, it will wait. 


873 

01:09:59,999 --> 01:10:01,766 

Stra and Nica ship Aves. 


874 

01:10:01,767 --> 01:10:04,882 

Neither do I expected to hear 

that you've got Harrison live 


875 

01:10:04,883 --> 01:10:06,558 

Despite orders. 


876 

01:10:07,777 --> 01:10:10,128 

I was improvising nevoiþi 


877 

01:10:10,129 --> 01:10:12,980 

the warp core 

defect was unexpected. 


878 

01:10:13,253 --> 01:10:16,531 

- But you and Tias already, right? 

- Not understanding what you mean. 


879 

01:10:16,532 --> 01:10:19,909 

Therefore aces came, did not you? 

That we ajutaþi with repairs. 


880 

01:10:21,038 --> 01:10:23,762 

Why else would come just 

Fleet Commander 


881 

01:10:23,763 --> 01:10:25,486 

the edge of the Neutral Zone? 


882 

01:10:26,282 --> 01:10:29,884 

- Captain, we ship scans. 

- Cãutaþi something, sir? 


883 

01:10:31,212 --> 01:10:32,895 

Where is deþinutul, Kirk? 


884 

01:10:32,896 --> 01:10:37,342 

According to Starfleet rules, I'm going 

Khan to go on the Earth 


885 

01:10:37,343 --> 01:10:38,570 

to be tried. 


886 

01:10:39,414 --> 01:10:41,133 

Shit. 


887 

01:10:42,041 --> 01:10:43,607 

Have you talked to him. 


888 

01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,454 

Exactly what I wanted to avoid. 


889 

01:10:47,646 --> 01:10:50,420 

I took a risk 

when I woke up miserable. 


890 

01:10:50,763 --> 01:10:54,133 

I thought his inteligenþa top 

Will you help us defend our 


891 

01:10:54,134 --> 01:10:55,646 

any hazards 

will meet in the future. 


892 

01:10:57,668 --> 01:10:59,229 

But I made a mistake. 


893 

01:10:59,470 --> 01:11:02,567 

And now my hands 

the blood of the people killed. 


894 

01:11:03,557 --> 01:11:07,175 

Please teach it to me 


895 

01:11:07,764 --> 01:11:10,105 

like to finish what I started. 


896 

01:11:13,763 --> 01:11:17,016 

And what vres to do 

the crew, sir? 


897 

01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:22,229 

To launch to the Klingons 

And to Persimmon 72 Vies? 


898 

01:11:22,469 --> 01:11:24,128 

To start a war at the same time? 


899 

01:11:24,129 --> 01:11:27,044 

He and his men in the torpedo. 


900 

01:11:27,145 --> 01:11:30,588 

I did not want to bother you unnecessarily 

Knowing what's inside them. 


901 

01:11:30,841 --> 01:11:32,824 

Have you seen what he's capable to do 

alone. 


902 

01:11:32,825 --> 01:11:35,779 

She imagined what would happen 

If we wake up and the ceilalþi? 


903 

01:11:37,713 --> 01:11:39,942 

What he said? 

Fighting for peace? 


904 

01:11:40,167 --> 01:11:42,927 

Play with you, son. 

Do not you see? 


905 

01:11:43,028 --> 01:11:46,658 

Khan and his crew were condamnaþi 

to death as a war criminal. 


906 

01:11:47,167 --> 01:11:49,276 

And now it is our duty 

perform this sentinþã 


907 

01:11:49,277 --> 01:11:51,427 

before to die 

And because of someone else. 


908 

01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:56,459 

Do you ever ask it again. 


909 

01:11:57,531 --> 01:12:00,005 

For the last time, son. 


910 

01:12:01,644 --> 01:12:05,249 

Lowers shields. 
Tell me where it 


911 

01:12:08,274 --> 01:12:10,236 

It's in Engineering, sir. 


912 

01:12:12,366 --> 01:12:15,038 

But it'll be right 

the transporter room. 


913 

01:12:15,825 --> 01:12:17,415 

I'll take care of him. 


914 

01:12:18,030 --> 01:12:20,653 

- Do not lower the shields, Mr. Sulu. 

915 

01:12:20,654 --> 01:12:22,990 

Khan is in the infirmary 

And that you and Tisi. 


916 

01:12:22,991 --> 01:12:24,644 

Can I know the details of your plan? 


917 

01:12:24,896 --> 01:12:28,844 

I told Marcus that will bring 

a fugitive on the earth. 
That'll do. 


918 

01:12:29,548 --> 01:12:31,192 

Mr. Chekov, we warp? 


919 

01:12:31,193 --> 01:12:35,935 

Sir, if you go to warp, 

you risk serious damage core. 


920 

01:12:36,036 --> 01:12:37,361 

Can they do it? 


921 

01:12:38,290 --> 01:12:41,924 

From a technical standpoint, yes, 

but I do not recommend, Captain. 


922 

01:12:42,406 --> 01:12:43,506 

They recorded. 


923 

01:12:44,466 --> 01:12:46,318 

Mr. Sulu, sets a course for Earth. 


924 

01:12:46,726 --> 01:12:47,746 

Yes, sir. 


925 

01:12:48,805 --> 01:12:50,037 

Go ahead. 


926 

01:12:57,917 --> 01:12:59,701 

At least we move again. 


927 

01:13:01,833 --> 01:13:04,110 

If you credeþi in Safety at warp 


928 

01:13:04,407 --> 01:13:05,964 

lets you know ELAS. 


929 

01:13:09,166 --> 01:13:10,905 

Lt. Uhura, contact Fleet. 


930 

01:13:10,998 --> 01:13:14,045 

Tell them that I was in the neutral zone urmãriþi 

of a Federation Starship unknown. 


931 

01:13:14,146 --> 01:13:15,331 

Communications not working, sir. 


932 

01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:19,877 

- Permission to enter the bridge. 

- Dr. Marcus. 


933 

01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:24,280 

You'll catch us and only I 

can not stop him to destroy the ship. 


934 

01:13:24,281 --> 01:13:25,984 

- Let me talk to him. 

- Carol, are the warp. 


935 

01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:27,645 

- We can catch up. 

- Yes. 


936 

01:13:27,646 --> 01:13:29,830 

The ship is an advanced model 

with superior performance ... 


937 

01:13:29,831 --> 01:13:32,324 

Captain, recepþionez data 

you are not understanding. 


938 

01:14:01,667 --> 01:14:04,634 

- Where are we? 

- At 237,000 miles from Earth. 


939 

01:14:04,635 --> 01:14:06,789 

- Damage report. 

- Weapons not working. 
We can not fight back. 


940 

01:14:06,908 --> 01:14:08,216 

We have a breakthrough in the hull. 


941 

01:14:08,697 --> 01:14:10,384 

- What damages have? 

- The hull is badly damaged, Captain. 


942 

01:14:16,167 --> 01:14:18,924 

Evasive maneuvers. 

Your right to point the Earth. 


943 

01:14:18,925 --> 01:14:21,816 

Wait. 
Everyone on the ship 

they die 


944 

01:14:21,817 --> 01:14:23,316 

If not you let me talk to him. 


945 

01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:27,273 

Uhura, call them. 


946 

01:14:28,158 --> 01:14:30,689 

Sir, are you, Carol. 


947 

01:14:40,212 --> 01:14:42,268 

What causa on that ship? 


948 

01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,844 

I heard what you said. 


949 

01:14:46,478 --> 01:14:49,629 

You made a mistake and now they're 

Silins and a whole îndrepþi. 


950 

01:14:51,068 --> 01:14:52,505 

But, Dad ... 


951 

01:14:55,967 --> 01:15:00,534 

I do not think the man that I grew 

is able 


952 

01:15:01,517 --> 01:15:04,134 

to destroy a vessel 

full of innocent people. 


953 

01:15:04,507 --> 01:15:08,985 

And if I be wrong, then you 

they destroy it with me on board. 


954 

01:15:12,982 --> 01:15:14,886 

No, Carol. 


955 

01:15:19,629 --> 01:15:21,163 

- Jim. 

- We can intercept the transmission signal? 


956 

01:15:21,164 --> 01:15:22,211 

No, sir. 


957 

01:15:23,961 --> 01:15:25,222 

Carol! 


958 

01:15:25,976 --> 01:15:27,629 

Captain Kirk without any Authorized 


959 

01:15:27,630 --> 01:15:29,730 

And in aiding 

the fugitive John Harrison 


960 

01:15:29,756 --> 01:15:31,861 

You deserted enemy territory. 


961 

01:15:32,062 --> 01:15:35,084 

I have other Options 

than follow you and destroy you. 


962 

01:15:35,566 --> 01:15:37,650 

- Aþintiþi phasers. 

- Stas! 


963 

01:15:37,651 --> 01:15:41,250 

Over quickly. 
Þintiþi torpedoes 

the aft deck to the Enterprise. 


964 

01:15:41,299 --> 01:15:43,847 

Sir, my crew just follow orders. 


965 

01:15:43,848 --> 01:15:46,525 

I take responsibility 

for my actions. 


966 

01:15:46,526 --> 01:15:48,926 

I myself took the decisions. 


967 

01:15:49,576 --> 01:15:53,512 

If you submit coordinates 

Khan, Please send me cruþaþi crew. 


968 

01:16:00,935 --> 01:16:02,376 

Please, sir. 


969 

01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:06,525 

I'll do whatever you want. 


970 

01:16:08,207 --> 01:16:10,415 

But Keep all them live. 


971 

01:16:11,393 --> 01:16:13,992 

Impressive sorry. 


972 

01:16:14,305 --> 01:16:18,176 

So you better sims, you know that anyway 

I was not going to Cruse crew. 


973 

01:16:20,237 --> 01:16:21,258 

Fire at will. 


974 

01:16:42,248 --> 01:16:43,788 

I'm sorry. 


975 

01:16:50,732 --> 01:16:53,192 

- Weapons can not shoot, sir. 

- Shields are down. 
We have no energy. 


976 

01:16:53,193 --> 01:16:55,533 

Someone in Engineering 

systems reiniþializat us. 


977 

01:16:55,534 --> 01:16:57,624 

What do you mean man? 
Who? 


978 

01:16:57,925 --> 01:17:00,094 

Their guns were deactivated. 


979 

01:17:00,825 --> 01:17:02,908 

Enteprise, I heard? 


980 

01:17:03,503 --> 01:17:04,606 

Scotty! 


981 

01:17:06,555 --> 01:17:09,408 

- Guess what I found near Jupiter. 

- Are you on the ship! 


982 

01:17:09,548 --> 01:17:12,945 

Right. 
And I just committed an act of treason 

against a Starfleet admiral. 


983 

01:17:12,946 --> 01:17:15,828 

I'd like to leave now. 

Beam me. 


984 

01:17:16,226 --> 01:17:19,904 

You're brilliant, but not much 

energy now. 
Stay on the reception hall. 


985 

01:17:19,905 --> 01:17:22,340 

What do you mean Aves energy? 

What stepped Enterprise? 


986 

01:17:23,309 --> 01:17:24,415 

Apelaþi me. 


987 

01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:27,745 

988 

01:17:28,350 --> 01:17:30,684 

Spock, the ship's status? 


989 

01:17:31,846 --> 01:17:33,064 

The options are our 

limited, Captain. 


990 

01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:34,969 

We can not shoot, can not run. 


991 

01:17:38,578 --> 01:17:39,828 

We have however an Option. 


992 

01:17:39,927 --> 01:17:42,393 

Uhura, Scotty when he contacted, 

Put him with me. 


993 

01:17:42,596 --> 01:17:44,678 

- Yes, sir. 

- Mr. Spock, take over. 


994 

01:17:48,667 --> 01:17:50,484 

Captain, you must object. 


995 

01:17:50,943 --> 01:17:52,661 

What? 
I said nothing. 


996 

01:17:52,662 --> 01:17:54,330 

Since we can not defeat 

of the outer vessel, 


997 

01:17:54,331 --> 01:17:55,893 

Options only 

is to attack from the inside. 


998 

01:17:55,894 --> 01:17:57,464 

And how big a team intervention 

would be detected, 


999 

01:17:57,465 --> 01:18:00,283 

staff should be minimized. 


1000 

01:18:00,817 --> 01:18:02,743 

Vesi welcome Resistance, 

So you need the one 


1001 

01:18:02,744 --> 01:18:05,669 

with advanced combat abilitãþi 

Tins and knowing details of the ship. 


1002 

01:18:06,459 --> 01:18:08,565 

That suggests to me 

vres that you alias with Khan 


1003 

01:18:08,566 --> 01:18:10,361 

man had to omorâþi. 


1004 

01:18:10,362 --> 01:18:12,470 

I'm not team up, but I use it. 


1005 

01:18:12,685 --> 01:18:14,505 

The enemy of the enemy is my friend my. 


1006 

01:18:14,506 --> 01:18:18,657 

An Arab proverb attributed to a trapped 

betrayed and beheaded subjected ITS. 


1007 

01:18:18,748 --> 01:18:20,438 

It's a good saying. 


1008 

01:18:20,847 --> 01:18:22,605 

- I'm with you, Captain. 

- I need you on the bridge. 


1009 

01:18:22,803 --> 01:18:24,654 

Faces you can not let it. 


1010 

01:18:24,655 --> 01:18:28,207 

My role is to make sure the ship 

that I had the best decisions possible 


1011 

01:18:28,208 --> 01:18:30,814 

thing you do not believe in state 

at this point. 


1012 

01:18:30,815 --> 01:18:31,815 

You are right! 


1013 

01:18:33,765 --> 01:18:38,011 

What you are about to do does not make sense, 

Does not make sense, it's instinctive. 


1014 

01:18:41,567 --> 01:18:43,769 

I have no idea what to do. 


1015 

01:18:45,269 --> 01:18:47,284 

I just know what I can do. 


1016 

01:18:48,167 --> 01:18:50,892 

Enterprise and her crew need 

a captain who knows what to do. 


1017 

01:18:55,887 --> 01:18:57,485 

Not me. 


1018 

01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:01,681 

It's you, Spock. 


1019 

01:19:24,756 --> 01:19:26,530 

Tell me what you know about that ship. 


1020 

01:19:26,816 --> 01:19:30,130 

Class Dreadnought. 
Twice 

more than three times faster. 


1021 

01:19:30,131 --> 01:19:32,669 

Advanced weaponry, as amended 

to functional with minimum crew. 


1022 

01:19:33,307 --> 01:19:36,325 

Unlike other Federation ships, 

is built only for battle. 


1023 

01:19:36,930 --> 01:19:39,621 

I will do everything in my power 


1024 

01:19:40,427 --> 01:19:42,644 

that you pay for what you did. 


1025 

01:19:48,682 --> 01:19:50,260 

But now I need your help. 


1026 

01:19:50,261 --> 01:19:52,086 

What I offer in return? 


1027 

01:19:53,712 --> 01:19:55,948 

You said you'd do anything 

your crew. 


1028 

01:19:57,609 --> 01:19:59,856 

- I can not guarantee their safety. 

- Captain. 


1029 

01:20:01,284 --> 01:20:04,483 

Not possible to guarantee 

not even the safety of your crew. 


1030 

01:20:11,018 --> 01:20:12,478 

Bones, what are you doing with that tribble? 


1031 

01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:16,294 

Tribble's dead. 

Inject platelets Khan 


1032 

01:20:16,329 --> 01:20:18,531 

in infected þesuturile 

necrotic host. 


1033 

01:20:19,346 --> 01:20:21,844 

Khan's cells regenerate 

an amazing pace. 


1034 

01:20:21,845 --> 01:20:22,945 

I want to know why. 


1035 

01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:30,872 

Come with me or not? 


1036 

01:20:33,672 --> 01:20:35,044 

What do you do? 


1037 

01:20:35,045 --> 01:20:38,601 

We'll be there. 
Sulu poziþioneazã 

Enterprise right now. 


1038 

01:20:38,809 --> 01:20:40,171 

Here the ship? 
How? 


1039 

01:20:40,172 --> 01:20:42,930 

On a service door in bay 7 

Section 101A. 


1040 

01:20:42,931 --> 01:20:45,126 

You need to find yourself commands 

The corecþie and to open airlock. 


1041 

01:20:45,127 --> 01:20:47,384 

Are you crazy? 
Whoever you are. 


1042 

01:20:47,799 --> 01:20:49,828 

Listen to it, Scotty. 

It'll be fine. 


1043 

01:20:49,829 --> 01:20:51,223 

Ba not be right. 


1044 

01:20:51,224 --> 01:20:55,847 

Want to open an airlock to space. 

Risk to die or explode. 


1045 

01:20:56,048 --> 01:20:59,884 

Lieutenant, is it possible to make contact 

the new Vulcan from current position? 


1046 

01:21:00,888 --> 01:21:02,767 

- I'll try. 

- Thanked. 


1047 

01:21:05,115 --> 01:21:07,299 

Mr. Sulu, which is the state 

other ships? 


1048 

01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:10,324 

Their systems are all inactive. 

Align the ship now. 


1049 

01:21:45,481 --> 01:21:46,764 

Scotty's the deal there? 


1050 

01:21:47,028 --> 01:21:49,522 

Captain, I'd like to Hear from You 

best. 


1051 

01:21:49,623 --> 01:21:52,085 

They blocked access to the ship's computer. 


1052 

01:21:52,086 --> 01:21:54,619 

Weapons are functional again 

three minutes. 


1053 

01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:57,971 

And I will not be able to stop 

to destroy Enterprise. 


1054 

01:21:57,972 --> 01:21:58,972 

Rãmâneþi the reception hall. 


1055 

01:21:59,611 --> 01:22:03,310 

Commander, garbage chute is directed 

to Section 101A of the other ship. 


1056 

01:22:03,818 --> 01:22:05,606 

Captain ships are aligned. 


1057 

01:22:05,607 --> 01:22:06,607 

Recepþionat. 


1058 

01:22:06,777 --> 01:22:09,547 

- Scotty. 

- I'm in the hangar. 
Give me a second. 


1059 

01:22:14,214 --> 01:22:16,302 

Allergy. 
Wait for. 


1060 

01:22:26,605 --> 01:22:30,543 

I do not know, Captain. 

The door is a pinhole ... 
is very small. 


1061 

01:22:30,674 --> 01:22:32,303 

The four feet of Patras. 


1062 

01:22:32,544 --> 01:22:34,900 

It's as if the Aces jump 

of a car in motion 


1063 

01:22:34,901 --> 01:22:37,089 

on a bridge in a glass of water. 


1064 

01:22:37,090 --> 01:22:38,666 

It's nothing. 
I've done this. 


1065 

01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:43,417 

And it was harder. 

Should jump on O. .. 


1066 

01:22:45,341 --> 01:22:48,684 

- Does not matter. 
Scotty! 

- Find corecþie commands? 


1067 

01:22:48,685 --> 01:22:50,511 

Not yet. 


1068 

01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:58,759 

Captain, before you switch on, 

you better and Tisi 


1069 

01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:00,885 

that there is a debris field 

between ships. 


1070 

01:23:00,886 --> 01:23:02,524 

Spock, not now. 
Scotty, you're doing? 


1071 

01:23:02,525 --> 01:23:06,523 

Give me two seconds, punk. 


1072 

01:23:14,764 --> 01:23:16,843 

Tell me it will work. 


1073 

01:23:18,129 --> 01:23:21,211 

I have information or trust 

sufficient to say, Doc. 


1074 

01:23:21,368 --> 01:23:22,750 

Wait, Captain. 


1075 

01:23:22,864 --> 01:23:24,404 

You all quiet. 


1076 

01:23:28,923 --> 01:23:30,684 

I'm ready to open a door 


1077 

01:23:31,031 --> 01:23:32,845 

- Are you ready? 

- You're? 


1078 

01:23:36,132 --> 01:23:37,592 

Spock Press. 


1079 

01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:40,712 

1080 

01:23:46,193 --> 01:23:48,501 

Executing secvenþa launch in 3 ... 


1081 

01:23:49,276 --> 01:23:51,675 

2 ... 
1 ... 


1082 

01:24:02,628 --> 01:24:05,085 

Mr. Kirk is heading 

to a collision at 0.32. 


1083 

01:24:05,531 --> 01:24:08,215 

- Captain, Aves remains directly in the bud. 

- Recepþionat. 


1084 

01:24:12,307 --> 01:24:13,695 

Jim, you kick bad. 


1085 

01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:15,667 

I know. 
And see me. 


1086 

01:24:25,751 --> 01:24:26,845 

Do not move. 


1087 

01:24:29,311 --> 01:24:30,897 

Use the compass viewfinder, Captain. 


1088 

01:24:30,898 --> 01:24:33,604 

Is required corecþie 

of 37.243 degrees. 


1089 

01:24:33,605 --> 01:24:35,567 

We understandable. 
Returning back to the course. 


1090 

01:24:38,410 --> 01:24:40,261 

Scotty, you're ready to open the door? 


1091 

01:24:41,165 --> 01:24:42,658 

What are you doing here? 


1092 

01:24:43,390 --> 01:24:45,630 

A minor revision to the console airlock. 


1093 

01:24:45,935 --> 01:24:46,952 

You're great. 


1094 

01:24:46,953 --> 01:24:48,256 

Mr. Scott, where are you? 


1095 

01:24:48,392 --> 01:24:50,863 

Captain, it appears that he will not hear. 

Trying to reconnect. 


1096 

01:24:50,982 --> 01:24:52,189 

1097 

01:24:54,755 --> 01:24:56,404 

- Damn. 

- Captain, what is it? 


1098 

01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:59,477 

The viewfinder is hit. 
Uhura, tell me 

that Mr. Scott responding again. 


1099 

01:24:59,478 --> 01:25:00,626 

Not yet. 
Trying 

restore the signal. 


1100 

01:25:00,927 --> 01:25:03,627 

Funcþioneazã communicator. 

I do not know do not respond. 


1101 

01:25:03,628 --> 01:25:04,628 

What is that? 


1102 

01:25:04,629 --> 01:25:06,083 

Are you a member of the Fleet 

or private employee? 


1103 

01:25:06,084 --> 01:25:08,372 

- Show and my other hand. 

- Aras as a private employee. 


1104 

01:25:08,514 --> 01:25:09,909 

Impending collision alert. 


1105 

01:25:09,910 --> 01:25:12,408 

Khan uses evasive actions. 

Are leftovers right in the bud. 


1106 

01:25:12,409 --> 01:25:13,609 

See them. 


1107 

01:25:18,926 --> 01:25:20,003 

I signal Khan lost. </ i> 


1108 

01:25:20,004 --> 01:25:21,898 

- Mr. Sulu, I lost Khan? 

- I do not know, Commander. 


1109 

01:25:21,899 --> 01:25:24,172 

It is difficult to detect 

by this debris. 


1110 

01:25:25,196 --> 01:25:27,267 

- Khan was hit? 

- Try to find him now. 


1111 

01:25:27,268 --> 01:25:31,622 

Captain, you must Change the 

destinaþia: 183 by 47.3 degrees. 


1112 

01:25:43,294 --> 01:25:45,434 

Spock, the viewfinder is not working. 

Flight at random. 


1113 

01:25:45,937 --> 01:25:47,417 

Captain, without compass 


1114 

01:25:47,418 --> 01:25:49,950 

achieve the intended purpose is impossible 

from a mathematical perspective. 


1115 

01:25:49,951 --> 01:25:52,434 

Spock, after you get back, you 

to talk about your clock. 


1116 

01:25:52,735 --> 01:25:55,085 

Commander, I'll succeed EASC. 


1117 

01:25:59,927 --> 01:26:02,688 

My visor still funcþioneazã. 

You see, Kirk. 


1118 

01:26:02,689 --> 01:26:04,702 

You're 200 feet 

in front of my right. 


1119 

01:26:04,759 --> 01:26:07,058 

Make a corecþie two degrees 

And follow me. 


1120 

01:26:19,450 --> 01:26:22,045 

Scotty, we're approaching. 

Receive ready? 
I recepþionezi? 


1121 

01:26:22,770 --> 01:26:23,684 

I recepþionezi, Scotty? 


1122 

01:26:23,885 --> 01:26:26,395 

If we hear, Mr. Scott, 

open door in 10 ... 


1123 

01:26:26,396 --> 01:26:27,574 

- 9 ... 


1124 

01:26:27,575 --> 01:26:29,216 

What's this countdown? 


1125 

01:26:29,217 --> 01:26:30,595 

I hear nothing. 


1126 

01:26:30,596 --> 01:26:31,496 

7 ... 


1127 

01:26:31,497 --> 01:26:33,107 

- Where are you, Mr. Scott? 

- 6 ... 


1128 

01:26:33,108 --> 01:26:35,382 

- 1800 meters ... 
1600 .... 

- 5 ... 


1129 

01:26:35,383 --> 01:26:36,899 

- Scotty, where are you? 

- 3 ... 


1130 

01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:38,444 

We arrive, Scotty! 
Please! 


1131 

01:26:38,725 --> 01:26:39,982 

- I'm sorry. 

- For what? 


1132 

01:26:39,983 --> 01:26:41,612 

- Mr. Scott, opens a door 

- Open the door! 


1133 

01:26:41,945 --> 01:26:42,951 

Now! 


1134 

01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:05,718 

Welcome aboard. 


1135 

01:27:07,954 --> 01:27:09,310 

I'm glad to see you, Scotty. 


1136 

01:27:09,311 --> 01:27:10,853 

Who is he? 


1137 

01:27:12,311 --> 01:27:14,027 

Khan, it's Scotty. 
Scotty, this is Khan. 


1138 

01:27:14,429 --> 01:27:15,614 

Welcome. 


1139 

01:27:16,263 --> 01:27:19,324 

I and they realize we're here. 

I know the best way to bridge. 


1140 

01:27:23,714 --> 01:27:25,293 

I'm stuck on stun. 


1141 

01:27:25,546 --> 01:27:28,118 

- Theirs will not be. 

- File not attempt to shoot pot cheeses. 


1142 

01:27:31,827 --> 01:27:34,227 

Commander, we have established links 

aces that I requested. 


1143 

01:27:35,154 --> 01:27:36,907 

On the screen, please. 


1144 

01:27:36,908 --> 01:27:37,908 

1145 

01:27:44,405 --> 01:27:45,700 

1146 

01:27:47,138 --> 01:27:48,206 

1147 

01:27:53,105 --> 01:27:54,341 

Admiral. 


1148 

01:27:57,404 --> 01:27:58,485 

Discussion ... 


1149 

01:28:00,974 --> 01:28:03,720 

I'm ashamed to be your daughter. 


1150 

01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:09,933 

Sir, they opened the door of a hangar 

axle 13. 


1151 

01:28:11,297 --> 01:28:12,388 

Khan. 


1152 

01:28:13,015 --> 01:28:14,925 

A to-and recently activated systems 

And we take it away? 


1153 

01:28:14,926 --> 01:28:17,645 

Turbolifts can be traced easily. 

Marcus ensnare us. 


1154 

01:28:17,887 --> 01:28:20,133 

This road leads 

besides Engineering. 


1155 

01:28:20,134 --> 01:28:23,373 

And will not use weapons 

that does not destabilize the warp core. 


1156 

01:28:23,374 --> 01:28:24,560 

We take advantage. 


1157 

01:28:24,734 --> 01:28:26,707 

- Where did you find that? 

- It's a long story. 


1158 

01:28:27,825 --> 01:28:29,374 

I'll be brief. 


1159 

01:28:29,917 --> 01:28:32,936 

In your travels, have you met 

ever a man named Khan? 


1160 

01:28:37,810 --> 01:28:41,169 

As you know, I swore 

not to reveal information 


1161 

01:28:41,170 --> 01:28:43,807 

which may 

to change their destiny. 


1162 

01:28:45,246 --> 01:28:49,928 

You have to follow their own path. 


1163 

01:28:53,495 --> 01:28:55,577 

That being said, 


1164 

01:28:56,608 --> 01:29:00,762 

Khan Noonien Singh was 

most dangerous adversary 


1165 

01:29:00,763 --> 01:29:02,625 

which has faced Enterprise. 


1166 

01:29:03,863 --> 01:29:06,197 

It's brilliant, ruthless 


1167 

01:29:06,498 --> 01:29:11,222 

And will not hesitate to kill Tosi. 


1168 

01:29:15,185 --> 01:29:16,641 

Aces defeated him? 


1169 

01:29:17,938 --> 01:29:21,273 

Yes, with a high pressure. 


1170 

01:29:23,193 --> 01:29:24,227 

1171 

01:29:24,228 --> 01:29:26,584 

I do not want to jinx it, 

but where is everyone? 


1172 

01:29:26,585 --> 01:29:29,049 

The ship is designed to manned functional 

minimum, even if one is needed. 


1173 

01:29:29,050 --> 01:29:30,050 

One? 


1174 

01:29:51,733 --> 01:29:52,979 

- Are you all right? 

1175 

01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:54,391 

Where is Khan? 


1176 

01:29:59,730 --> 01:30:03,856 

Lt, I gathered Tosi ofiþerii 

doctors and engineers hold weapons. 


1177 

01:30:04,215 --> 01:30:05,902 

All right. 


1178 

01:30:07,136 --> 01:30:11,693 

Dr. McCoy, you inadvertently activated 

a torpedo. 
Possible repeat the process? 


1179 

01:30:11,694 --> 01:30:14,205 

- Why would I want to do this? 

- Possible or not? 


1180 

01:30:14,464 --> 01:30:17,136 

I'm a doctor, not mechanical torpedoes! 


1181 

01:30:17,137 --> 01:30:20,537 

Just 'cause you're doctor 

I want to get the attention asculþi. 


1182 

01:30:22,076 --> 01:30:23,350 

Where is it? 


1183 

01:30:28,836 --> 01:30:30,011 

Shit! 


1184 

01:30:30,632 --> 01:30:31,749 

Follow me. 


1185 

01:30:34,492 --> 01:30:36,588 

When we get to the bridge, to sleep. 


1186 

01:30:37,163 --> 01:30:40,585 

Khan paralyzed him? 

I think it will. 


1187 

01:30:40,845 --> 01:30:43,100 

November helped him. 


1188 

01:30:51,968 --> 01:30:54,428 

- We have energy again, sir. 

- Enterprise Þintiþi again. 


1189 

01:30:54,429 --> 01:30:55,429 

1190 

01:31:09,309 --> 01:31:11,098 

Take care and remain a 


1191 

01:31:12,245 --> 01:31:13,531 

Excuse me. 


1192 

01:31:17,158 --> 01:31:19,249 

Admiral Marcus, sunteþi arrested. 


1193 

01:31:19,362 --> 01:31:21,698 

You did not do that, do you? 


1194 

01:31:23,062 --> 01:31:25,23



4 

Admiral, Lift from your chair. 


1195 

01:31:25,235 --> 01:31:27,627 

Think for a minute 

what are you, Kirk. 


1196 

01:31:28,025 --> 01:31:30,065 

Think about what you 

Kronos made. 


1197 

01:31:30,474 --> 01:31:33,101 

You led an incursion 

enemy planet. 


1198 

01:31:33,191 --> 01:31:35,018 

You killed a Klingon patrol. 


1199 

01:31:35,019 --> 01:31:38,346 

Even if you escape undetected, 

all war will break out. 


1200 

01:31:38,447 --> 01:31:41,404 

And who's going to lead? 
You? 


1201 

01:31:42,537 --> 01:31:43,860 

It must remain in charge, 


1202 

01:31:43,861 --> 01:31:46,461 

all our way of vias 

going to be destroyed. 


1203 

01:31:47,286 --> 01:31:51,575 

If you want to leave the ship, 

will have to kill me. 


1204 

01:31:52,302 --> 01:31:54,142 

I'll kill you, sir. 


1205 

01:31:55,714 --> 01:31:59,091 

But can paralyze you 

And pluck you out of the chair. 


1206 

01:31:59,753 --> 01:32:01,923 

I'd rather not do 

in front of your daughter 


1207 

01:32:05,832 --> 01:32:07,805 

- Are you okay? 

- Yes, Captain. 


1208 

01:32:10,005 --> 01:32:11,033 

Jim! 


1209 

01:32:24,782 --> 01:32:26,638 

Listen! 
Hold on! 


1210 

01:32:39,977 --> 01:32:43,019 

And I must to sleep. 


1211 

01:32:48,658 --> 01:32:49,806 

Where's the captain, Mr. Sulu? 


1212 

01:32:49,807 --> 01:32:52,066 

Sensors not working, sir. 

I can not locate. 


1213 

01:32:53,967 --> 01:32:55,965 

I have a simple proposal for you. 


1214 

01:32:55,966 --> 01:32:58,856 

- Captain! 

- Your crew my crew instead. 


1215 

01:32:58,857 --> 01:33:00,034 

You betrayed us. 


1216 

01:33:00,035 --> 01:33:01,939 

Isteþ What are you, Mr. Spock. 


1217 

01:33:02,326 --> 01:33:03,953 

Spock, no ... 


1218 

01:33:06,254 --> 01:33:09,090 

Mr. Spock, give me crew. 


1219 

01:33:10,141 --> 01:33:11,724 

What will you do after I give? 


1220 

01:33:11,725 ??--> 01:33:14,016 

We'll continue our work 

before the exile. 


1221 

01:33:14,017 --> 01:33:15,179 

Including, as far as I know, 


1222 

01:33:15,180 --> 01:33:18,632 

genocide fiinþelor 

they consideraþi lower. 


1223 

01:33:18,812 --> 01:33:21,104 

To destroy you, Mr. Spock? 


1224 

01:33:21,789 --> 01:33:24,423 

Or give me what I want? 


1225 

01:33:26,915 --> 01:33:28,926 

Our carriers do not. 


1226 

01:33:28,927 --> 01:33:32,897 

Luckily, mine funcþioneazã 

perfectly. 
Lowers shields. 


1227 

01:33:33,702 --> 01:33:36,899 

If I do that, I have no warranty 

that will not destroy the Enterprise. 


1228 

01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:39,592 

Then you take it logically, Mr. Spock. 


1229 

01:33:39,593 --> 01:33:43,186 

First, a master to kill 

as to demonstrate my determination, 


1230 

01:33:43,187 --> 01:33:45,855 

And if you still do not give in, 

I'll have no choice 


1231 

01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:48,445 

than to kill you 

And all your crew. 


1232 

01:33:48,446 --> 01:33:52,743 

If you destroy the ship, 

He'll kill and peers. 


1233 

01:33:52,744 --> 01:33:55,485 

Your crew needs oxygen 

as to supravieþuiascã. 
Mine do not. 


1234 

01:33:55,581 --> 01:33:59,524 

I will Sinti systems Supports 

Behind the nacelle aft of life. 


1235 

01:33:59,629 --> 01:34:02,763 

And after what you sufocaþi with Tosi, 


1236 

01:34:02,764 --> 01:34:07,404 

'll step over your dead bodies 

to get my people. 


1237 

01:34:12,439 --> 01:34:14,324 

I start? 


1238 

01:34:18,234 --> 01:34:19,491 

1239 

01:34:22,952 --> 01:34:25,127 

A choice înþeleaptã, Mr. Spock. 


1240 

01:34:33,572 --> 01:34:36,330 

I see the 72 torpedoes 

are still in their tubes. 


1241 

01:34:36,609 --> 01:34:38,972 

You'll realize 

If you are not mine, Commander. 


1242 

01:34:38,973 --> 01:34:41,540 

Vulcans do not lie. 


1243 

01:34:42,376 --> 01:34:44,706 

Torpedoes are yours. 


1244 

01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:56,830 

Thanked, Mr. Spock. 


1245 

01:34:57,209 --> 01:35:01,172 

We respect understanding. 

Respect her and you. 


1246 

01:35:02,436 --> 01:35:06,667 

Kirk's time to go back 

to your crew. 


1247 

01:35:07,590 --> 01:35:09,005 

After all, 


1248 

01:35:12,022 --> 01:35:15,219 

No vessel shall not perish 

without its captain. 


1249 

01:35:17,877 --> 01:35:19,261 

A ASINT phasers at us, sir. 


1250 

01:35:25,575 --> 01:35:27,217 

Dasi us out. 


1251 

01:35:35,918 --> 01:35:37,449 

Shields at 6%. 


1252 

01:35:37,851 --> 01:35:39,795 

Torpedoes. 
How long is it, Lieutenant. 
? 


1253 

01:35:39,973 --> 01:35:41,092 

12 seconds, sir. 


1254 

01:35:41,093 --> 01:35:44,062 

The crew of the Enterprise, Prepare yourself 

to detonate nearby. 


1255 

01:35:44,063 --> 01:35:45,874 

What are you talking about? 
What is detonation? 


1256 

01:35:45,875 --> 01:35:48,074 

A primed torpedoes. 


1257 

01:36:06,278 --> 01:36:08,222 

Sir, I deactivated guns. 


1258 

01:36:09,189 --> 01:36:11,367 

- A good move, Commander. 

- Thanked, lt. 


1259 

01:36:12,779 --> 01:36:14,004 

- Bones! 

- Sister! 


1260 

01:36:19,326 --> 01:36:20,371 

I'm glad to see you, Jim. 


1261 

01:36:20,372 --> 01:36:22,049 

You helped Spock 

to detonate torpedoes? 


1262 

01:36:22,207 --> 01:36:24,290 

- Of course. 

- He killed his crew Khan. 


1263 

01:36:24,881 --> 01:36:26,951 

Spock is not of emotions, but not cruel. 


1264 

01:36:26,952 --> 01:36:28,565 

I saved the crew of Khan. 


1265 

01:36:28,966 --> 01:36:33,364 

72 human crowd, 

alive and unharmed in cryovials. 


1266 

01:36:34,474 --> 01:36:35,830 

Bastard! 


1267 

01:36:41,669 --> 01:36:43,407 

Sir, Network Central 

supply fails. 


1268 

01:36:43,608 --> 01:36:46,310 

- Treceþi on auxiliary power. 

- And it fails. 


1269 

01:36:54,318 --> 01:36:56,423 

Commander, the ship is caught 

gravitaþional field of the Earth. 


1270 

01:36:56,424 --> 01:36:58,986 

- Can we stop it? 

- I can not do anything. 


1271 

01:37:10,123 --> 01:37:11,296 

Evacuated area. 


1272 

01:37:11,850 --> 01:37:13,609 

The emergency quarantine. 


1273 

01:37:13,610 --> 01:37:14,854 

I hope you do not get seasick. 


1274 

01:37:14,893 --> 01:37:16,812 

- You? 

- Yes. 


1275 

01:37:16,813 --> 01:37:19,164 

- Lt, announced evacuate all puns. 

- Yes, sir. 


1276 

01:37:20,841 --> 01:37:24,086 

As captain provisional 

abandonaþi be ordered to ship. 


1277 

01:37:25,547 --> 01:37:27,324 

I will stay on board 

And I'll transfer all energy 


1278 

01:37:27,325 --> 01:37:29,361 

by susþinerea of ??life 

And exhaust hangar. 


1279 

01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:33,564 

1280 

01:37:33,565 --> 01:37:36,916 

With all due respect, Commander, 

we do not go anywhere. 


1281 

01:37:40,372 --> 01:37:43,138 

One day I missed the ship. 

One day! 


1282 

01:37:47,722 --> 01:37:50,088 

Gravitaþionale systems 

failing. 
Hold on tight. 


1283 

01:38:00,916 --> 01:38:05,617 

Evacuation would be impossible unless we 

energy to stabilize the ship. 


1284 

01:38:05,865 --> 01:38:08,428 

- We can restore power? 

- Only in Engineering. 


1285 

01:38:08,618 --> 01:38:10,823 

We must return to the warp core. 


1286 

01:38:13,970 --> 01:38:15,037 

Jim. 


1287 

01:38:16,298 --> 01:38:18,677 

Scotty, we must go 

energy. 
Come. 


1288 

01:38:36,621 --> 01:38:37,658 

We have to jump! 


1289 

01:38:37,659 --> 01:38:38,800 

- What? 

- Jump! 


1290 

01:38:38,801 --> 01:38:40,001 

- God! 

1291 

01:38:42,091 --> 01:38:44,464 

The emergency power 

is at 15% and dropping. 


1292 

01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:05,870 

- Jim. 

- Rails yourself. 


1293 

01:39:05,871 --> 01:39:07,076 

I can not. 


1294 

01:39:25,984 --> 01:39:27,689 

Gotcha, Captain. 


1295 

01:39:27,690 --> 01:39:29,617 

- Chekov. 

- Do not let go. 


1296 

01:39:40,344 --> 01:39:43,184 

Even if our plan works, 

still have to divert energy. 


1297 

01:39:43,185 --> 01:39:44,721 

- He's right, Captain. 

- What are you talking about? 


1298 

01:39:44,978 --> 01:39:47,063 

Someone needs to turn 

corecþie command. 


1299 

01:39:47,064 --> 01:39:49,598 

- And the lad's a catch ... 

- Behind parabolicei deflectors. 


1300 

01:39:49,599 --> 01:39:51,405 

- I'm going now. 

- Let's go. 


1301 

01:40:07,417 --> 01:40:09,955 

I initiated evacuation protocol. </ i> 


1302 

01:40:09,956 --> 01:40:11,878 

I Începeþi evacuation. </ i> 


1303 

01:40:14,617 --> 01:40:16,904 

Mr. Sulu, divert all energy 

available to the stabilizer. 


1304 

01:40:16,905 --> 01:40:18,563 

I do my best, sir. 


1305 

01:40:37,925 --> 01:40:39,463 

Oh no! 


1306 

01:40:39,464 --> 01:40:41,033 

- Injectors are not aligned. 


1307 

01:40:41,034 --> 01:40:43,145 

There's no way to divert energy. 


1308 

01:40:43,146 --> 01:40:45,712 

The ship is dead, sir. 
Is lost. 


1309 

01:40:47,497 --> 01:40:48,919 

Yes, it's not 


1310 

01:40:49,272 --> 01:40:50,450 

Wait, Jim. 


1311 

01:40:50,451 --> 01:40:51,987 

If you go in there, I'll die. 


1312 

01:40:51,988 --> 01:40:54,247 

Can you hear me? 
Radiation kill us. 


1313 

01:40:54,486 --> 01:40:56,927 

I asculþi? 
What are you doing? 


1314 

01:40:56,928 --> 01:40:57,994 

Open a door 
I'm going inside. 


1315 

01:40:57,995 --> 01:41:00,287 

The door that shields us from Radiation. 


1316 

01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:02,244 

I die before he go up. 


1317 

01:41:05,115 --> 01:41:06,639 

You should not climb. 


1318 

01:42:12,155 --> 01:42:14,090 

If you do not restore power 

And Shields, 


1319 

01:42:14,091 --> 01:42:16,088 

We'll be incineraþi 

entry into the atmosphere. 


1320 

01:43:23,473 --> 01:43:26,500 

- Warp core started again. 

- Thrusters, Mr. Sulu. 


1321 

01:43:31,374 --> 01:43:33,914 

Thrusters. 
Wait for! 


1322 

01:44:00,796 --> 01:44:03,187 

- Shields active. 

- We have energy again. 


1323 

01:44:03,528 --> 01:44:06,110 

Mr. Spock, I stabilized the ship. 


1324 

01:44:06,266 --> 01:44:07,765 

It's a miracle. 


1325 

01:44:09,785 --> 01:44:11,433 

There is such a thing. 


1326 

01:44:14,017 --> 01:44:15,985 

Engineering to bridge. 

Mr. Spock. 


1327 

01:44:15,986 --> 01:44:19,381 

- Mr. Scott. 

- Sir, I came up here. 


1328 

01:44:19,859 --> 01:44:21,223 

Grãbiþi sure. 


1329 

01:44:44,030 --> 01:44:46,830 

- Open. 

- Decontamination not finished yet. 


1330 

01:44:46,831 --> 01:44:48,283 

A radiate throughout the compartment. 


1331 

01:44:48,284 --> 01:44:49,900 

The door is locked, sir. 


1332 

01:45:19,703 --> 01:45:21,149 

How's the ship? 


1333 

01:45:22,405 --> 01:45:23,926 

Out of danger. 


1334 

01:45:24,951 --> 01:45:26,306 

All right. 


1335 

01:45:26,533 --> 01:45:27,969 

Aces rescued the crew. 


1336 

01:45:30,409 --> 01:45:32,844 

You used what he wanted Khan 

against him. 


1337 

01:45:37,095 --> 01:45:38,894 

A good move. 


1338 

01:45:40,496 --> 01:45:42,314 

What I have done is your 


1339 

01:45:44,527 --> 01:45:48,796 

And that's what you did. 


1340 

01:45:49,888 --> 01:45:51,470 

It was logical. 


1341 

01:45:58,250 --> 01:45:59,869 

I'm afraid, Spock. 


1342 

01:46:03,283 --> 01:46:05,101 

I do not see the hope. 


1343 

01:46:09,467 --> 01:46:11,801 

How do you choose not to Sims? 


1344 

01:46:18,561 --> 01:46:20,143 

I do not know. 


1345 

01:46:22,879 --> 01:46:25,166 

I feel right now. 


1346 

01:46:31,907 --> 01:46:34,630 

I wanted to know 

Why do not I let you die 


1347 

01:46:38,567 --> 01:46:40,549 

why I came back for you. 


1348 

01:46:42,538 --> 01:46:44,665 

Because you're my friend. 


1349 

01:48:08,672 --> 01:48:11,097 

Khan! 


1350 

01:48:14,128 --> 01:48:15,524 

It was close. 


1351 

01:48:18,578 --> 01:48:22,485 

Sets destinaþia: 

Starfleet Headquarters. 


1352 

01:48:22,624 --> 01:48:26,253 

I motors are compromised. 

Landing uncertain. </ I> 


1353 

01:48:26,454 --> 01:48:27,650 

I Confirm Order. </ i> 


1354 

01:48:28,195 --> 01:48:29,608 

Confirm. 


1355 

01:49:34,187 --> 01:49:36,485 

Scanaþi enemy ship 

After the signal lifetime. 


1356 

01:49:36,538 --> 01:49:38,373 

Sir, no one could supravieþui. 


1357 

01:49:39,927 --> 01:49:41,117 

He could. 


1358 

01:49:41,531 --> 01:49:42,637 

Yes, sir. 


1359 

01:50:14,617 --> 01:50:16,044 

He just jumped 30 meters. 


1360 

01:50:16,145 --> 01:50:17,387 

We can teleport? 


1361 

01:50:17,388 --> 01:50:19,645 

Damages are too high. 

Not recepþionez signal. 


1362 

01:50:20,018 --> 01:50:22,649 

But can you beam 

on your foot, sir. 


1363 

01:50:23,504 --> 01:50:24,749 

Go after him. 


1364 

01:50:30,133 --> 01:50:32,076 

- Be ready to receive and your coordinates. 

1365 

01:50:32,374 --> 01:50:35,093 

Position: 351 752 519. 


1366 

01:50:35,094 --> 01:50:36,595 

Coordinates confirmed. 


1367 

01:52:15,050 --> 01:52:17,031 

Aduceþi a cryotube. 
Now! 


1368 

01:53:12,588 --> 01:53:15,524 

Remove this from cryotube it on. 

Hold him in a coma. 


1369 

01:53:15,692 --> 01:53:17,233 

I'll put him on Kirk inside. 


1370 

01:53:17,234 --> 01:53:19,129 

It's our only chance 

the functions to maintain its brain. 


1371 

01:53:19,130 ??--> 01:53:21,788 

- What's left of the blood of Khan? 

- Nothing. 


1372 

01:53:22,915 --> 01:53:25,597 

Enterprise to Spock. 
Spock! 


1373 

01:54:26,811 --> 01:54:28,268 

Activate cryogenic secvenþa. 


1374 

01:54:31,064 --> 01:54:33,414 

McCoy to bridge. 

I can not contact Spock. 


1375 

01:54:33,732 --> 01:54:38,084 

I need Khan in lifetime. 

Aduceþi the bastard back on board. 


1376 

01:54:39,584 --> 01:54:40,930 

I think it can save Kirk. 


1377 

01:54:40,931 --> 01:54:44,582 

- He can teleport the ship? 

- They all move. 
I can not lock on. 


1378 

01:54:45,025 --> 01:54:46,305 

Go to teleport someone there? 


1379 

01:55:21,224 --> 01:55:22,224 

1380 

01:55:29,838 --> 01:55:30,901 

1381 

01:55:31,002 --> 01:55:33,124 

Spock, no! 
Turns out! 


1382 

01:55:33,305 --> 01:55:36,158 

to save Kirk. 


1383 

01:55:45,278 --> 01:55:47,417 

- What is it? 

- Male. 


1384 

01:55:48,273 --> 01:55:49,330 

To call Jim. 


1385 

01:55:49,331 --> 01:55:50,431 

Your father was captain of the ship. 


1386 

01:55:54,563 --> 01:55:55,583 

I challenge you to excel. 


1387 

01:56:04,210 --> 01:56:07,372 

Stop being so melodramatic. 

Do not die well. 


1388 

01:56:08,009 --> 01:56:10,135 

Transfusion you exhausted. 


1389 

01:56:10,472 --> 01:56:12,599 

- You spent two weeks in bed. 

- Transfusion? 


1390 

01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:15,520 

Your cells were heavily irradiated. 

I had no choice. 


1391 

01:56:16,407 --> 01:56:17,556 

Khan? 


1392 

01:56:17,826 --> 01:56:21,085 

After we got him, we synthesized 

blood serum of miraculous. 


1393 

01:56:21,648 --> 01:56:25,725 

Do you have any criminal impulses, 

Sims get a power-hungry tyrant? 


1394 

01:56:25,726 --> 01:56:27,105 

No more than usual. 


1395 

01:56:28,229 --> 01:56:29,818 

How did you get it? 


1396 

01:56:29,819 --> 01:56:31,140 

I did not get it. 


1397 

01:56:39,992 --> 01:56:41,762 

You saved my lifetime. 


1398 

01:56:41,763 --> 01:56:44,140 

I came and I with Uhura 

a hand. 


1399 

01:56:45,648 --> 01:56:48,263 

I saved the life of aces 

me and the whole crew ... 


1400 

01:56:51,644 --> 01:56:53,054 

Thanked. 


1401 

01:56:54,263 --> 01:56:56,142 

You're welcome, Jim. 


1402 

01:57:07,123 --> 01:57:09,940 

Will always find someone 

that would do us harm. 


1403 

01:57:12,444 --> 01:57:17,811 

As to stop, the risk of expect 

same evil within us. 


1404 

01:57:24,507 --> 01:57:26,805 

Our first impulse 

is to seek revenge 


1405 

01:57:26,806 --> 01:57:29,478 

when we lose loved ones. 


1406 

01:57:32,084 --> 01:57:34,056 

But that's us. 


1407 

01:57:35,665 --> 01:57:40,160 

We are here today 

that you renamed USS Enterprise. 


1408 

01:57:40,473 --> 01:57:45,081 

And to honor those 

that and lost life of a year ago. 


1409 

01:57:46,454 --> 01:57:50,608 

When Christopher Pike gave me ship 

I asked to recite the oath captain. 


1410 

01:57:51,947 --> 01:57:54,444 

Words whose importance 

not understanding then. 


1411 

01:57:55,585 --> 01:57:58,364 

But now they look 

as a call to remember 


1412 

01:57:59,550 --> 01:58:01,205 

who was formerly 


1413 

01:58:03,157 --> 01:58:05,347 

And who should be back. 


1414 

01:58:06,646 --> 01:58:08,293 

And these words ... 


1415 

01:58:08,841 --> 01:58:11,555 

Of space, the final frontier. 


1416 

01:58:12,338 --> 01:58:15,979 

These are the voyages 

of space ship Enterprise. 


1417 

01:58:16,904 --> 01:58:20,909 

Its mission five years: 

to explore strange new worlds and ... 


1418 

01:58:21,566 --> 01:58:24,610 

... 
to discover new forms of vias 

And we civilization ... 


1419 

01:58:25,675 --> 01:58:29,460 

to presume where one 

has gone before. 


1420 

01:58:32,382 --> 01:58:33,902 

Captain on the bridge. 


1421 

01:58:37,517 --> 01:58:39,657 

It's hard to exits your 

Once you ordinary. 


1422 

01:58:39,746 --> 01:58:41,285 

Not so, Mr. Sulu? 


1423 

01:58:41,565 --> 01:58:43,245 

Call Bina title of captain. 


1424 

01:58:43,796 --> 01:58:45,058 

It's you, sir. 


1425 

01:58:47,089 --> 01:58:49,386 

Mr. Scott, how's warp core? 


1426 

01:58:49,387 --> 01:58:53,425 

Purrs like a pisicuþã, Captain. 

He's ready for a long trip. 


1427 

01:58:54,169 --> 01:58:55,186 

Excellent. 


1428 

01:58:55,187 --> 01:58:57,310 

Come on, Bones. 
It'll be fun. 


1429 

01:58:58,986 --> 01:59:02,162 

Five years in space. 
Hello. 


1430 

01:59:02,640 --> 01:59:03,828 

Doctor Marcus. 


1431 

01:59:05,533 --> 01:59:06,965 

Nice 

you came into our family. 


1432 

01:59:07,204 --> 01:59:08,575 

It's good to have a family. 


1433 

01:59:11,947 --> 01:59:13,698 

- Spock. 

- Captain. 


1434 

01:59:16,807 --> 01:59:18,060 

Where to go? 


1435 

01:59:19,867 --> 01:59:22,657 

Since I had a place 

mission so long, 


1436 

01:59:25,187 --> 01:59:27,264 

leave the decision in your mind, Captain. 


1437 

01:59:36,811 --> 01:59:39,218 

Mr. Sulu, start. 


1438 

01:59:39,713 --> 01:59:40,861 

Yes, Captain.
