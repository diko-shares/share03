1
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.040
These are dark times, there is no denying.

2
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.250
Our world has, perhaps,
faced no greater threat than it does today.

3
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.210
But I say this to our citizenry:

4
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.260
We, ever your servants...

5
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.100
...will continue to defend your liberty...

6
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.600
...and repel the forces
that seek to take it from you.

7
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.110
Your Ministry remains...

8
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.610
...strong.

9
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.130
Hermione. Tea's ready, darling.

10
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.260
Coming, Mom.

11
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.100
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.

12
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.310
I still don't understand
why we have to leave.

13
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.230
Because, unh,
it's not safe for us here any more.

14
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.000
Ron, tell your father
supper's nearly ready.

15
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.710
Is this in Australia?

16
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.840
Looks wonderful, doesn't it?

17
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.890
Three and a half thousand
kilometers along Australia's east coast.

18
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.720
Obliviate.

19
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.730
Severus.

20
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.280
I was beginning to worry
you had lost your way.

21
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.910
Come, we've saved you a seat.

22
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.660
You bring news, I trust?

23
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.500
It will happen Saturday next, at nightfall.

24
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.050
I've heard differently, my Lord.

25
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.340
Dawlish, the Auror,
has let slip that the Potter boy...

26
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.640
...will not be moved
until the 30th of this month.

27
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.350
The day before he turns 17.

28
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.720
This is a false trail.

29
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.560
The Auror Office no longer plays any part
in the protection of Harry Potter.

30
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.110
Those closest to him believe
we have infiltrated the Ministry.

31
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.320
Well, they got that right, haven't they?

32
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.240
What say you, Pius?

33
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.370
One hears many things, my Lord.

34
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.130
Whether the truth is among them
is not clear.

35
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.670
Heh. Spoken like a true politician.

36
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.880
You will, I think,
prove most useful, Pius.

37
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.720
- Where will he be taken, the boy?
- To a safe house.

38
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.770
Most likely the home of someone
in the Order.

39
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.190
I'm told it's been given
every manner of protection possible.

40
00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.940
Once there,
it will be impractical to attack him.

41
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:06.070
Ahem. My Lord.
I'd like to volunteer myself for this task.

42
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.240
I want to kill the boy.

43
00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.780
Wormtail!

44
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.870
Have I not spoken to you
about keeping our guest quiet?

45
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.000
Yes, my Lord.

46
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.830
Right away, my Lord.

47
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.590
As inspiring
as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix...

48
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.300
...I must be the one to kill Harry Potter.

49
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.600
But I face an unfortunate complication.

50
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.940
That my wand and Potter's
share the same core.

51
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:46.780
They are, in some ways, twins.

52
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:51.620
We can wound,
but not fatally harm one another.

53
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.040
If I am to kill him...

54
00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.460
...I must do it with another's wand.

55
00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:08.180
Come, surely one of you
would like the honor?

56
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.470
Mm?

57
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.980
What about you, Lucius?

58
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.860
My Lord?

59
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.980
"My Lord?"

60
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.700
I require your wand.

61
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.500
Do I detect elm?

62
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.630
Yes, my Lord.

63
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.510
And the core?

64
00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.850
Dragon. Ahem.

65
00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.690
Dragon heartstring, my Lord.

66
00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.020
- Dragon heartstring.
- Mm.

67
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.540
To those of you who do not know...

68
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:22.370
...we are joined tonight
by Miss Charity Burbage...

69
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:28.050
...who, until recently, taught at Hogwarts
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

70
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:31.680
Her specialty was Muggle Studies.

71
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:41.140
It is Miss Burbage's belief
that Muggles are not so different from us.

72
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:44.940
She would, given her way...

73
00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:47.650
...have us mate with them.

74
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:57.530
To her, the mixture of magical
and Muggle blood is not an abomination...

75
00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.750
...but something to be encouraged.

76
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.670
Severus.

77
00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.790
Severus, please.

78
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.630
We're friends.

79
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:15.970
Avada Kedavra!

80
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:28.270
Nagini.

81
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.530
Dinner.

82
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.220
- Hello, Harry.
- All right. Wow.

83
00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:23.510
Hello.

84
00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.560
- You're looking fit.
- Yeah, he's absolutely gorgeous.

85
00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.230
What say we get undercover
before someone murders him?

86
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.400
Evening.

87
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.900
I thought you were looking after...

88
00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:38.900
...the Prime Minister.
- You are more important.

89
00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:43.030
- Hello, Harry. Bill Weasley.
- Oh. Pleasure to meet you.

90
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.200
- He was never always this handsome.
- Dead ugly.

91
00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:47.750
True enough.

92
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.460
Owe it all to a werewolf,
name of Greyback.

93
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:54.000
- Hope to repay the favor one day.
- You're still beautiful to me, William.

94
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:58.010
Just remember, Fleur,
Bill takes his steaks on the raw side now.

95
00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:00.510
My husband, the joker.

96
00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.930
By the way, wait till you hear the news.
Remus and I...

97
00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.560
All right. We'll have time
for a cozy catch-up later.

98
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.680
We've got to get the hell out of here.
And soon.

99
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:13.610
Potter, you're underage, which means
you've still got the Trace on you.

100
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:14.820
What's the Trace?

101
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.650
If you sneeze, the Ministry will know
who wipes your nose.

102
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.990
We have to use those means of transport
the Trace can't detect:

103
00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.490
Brooms, Thestrals and the like.
We go in pairs.

104
00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:27.450
That way, if anyone's out there waiting
for us, and I reckon there will be...

105
00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.120
...they won't know which Harry Potter
is the real one.

106
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:31.710
The real one?

107
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.130
I believe you're familiar
with this particular brew.

108
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.630
No. Absolutely not.

109
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.130
I told you he'd take it well.

110
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:43.430
No, if you think I'm gonna let everyone
risk their lives for me, I...

111
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.640
- Never done that before, have we?
- No. No. This is different.

112
00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:48.810
I mean, taking that, becoming me. No.

113
00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.810
Well, none of us really fancy it, mate.

114
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:55.150
Imagine if something went wrong, and
we ended up a scrawny, specky git forever.

115
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:56.980
Everyone here is of age, Potter.

116
00:12:57.690 --> 00:12:59.150
They've all agreed to take the risk.

117
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:03.410
Technically, I've been coerced.

118
00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.780
Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter.

119
00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.490
- Always been a huge admirer.
- Nip it, Mundungus.

120
00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.330
All right, Granger, as discussed.

121
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.210
- Blimey, Hermione.
- Straight in here, if you please.

122
00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:29.260
For those of you who haven't taken
Polyjuice Potion before, fair warning:

123
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:31.060
It tastes like goblin piss.

124
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:34.190
Have a lot of experiences with that,
do you, Mad-Eye?

125
00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.020
Just trying to diffuse the tension.

126
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:40.860
Oh.

127
00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:45.700
Ugh.

128
00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:12.060
Wow, we're identical.

129
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:13.230
Not yet, you're not.

130
00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.520
Haven't got anything
a bit more sporting, have you?

131
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:21.150
I don't really fancy this color.

132
00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.110
- Well, fancy this, you're not you.
- So shut it and strip.

133
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.860
All right, all right.

134
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:27.570
You'll need to change too, Potter.

135
00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.740
Bill, look away. I'm hideous.

136
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:33.200
I knew she was lying about that tattoo.

137
00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:35.790
Harry, your eyesight really is awful.

138
00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.670
Right, then. We'll be pairing off.
Each Potter will have a protector.

139
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.130
Mundungus, stick tight to me.
I wanna keep an eye on you.

140
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.510
- As for Harry...
Yes?

141
00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.760
The real Harry.

142
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:50.260
- Where the devil are you, anyway?
- Here.

143
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:52.430
You'll ride with Hagrid.

144
00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:57.600
I brought you here 16 years ago when
you were no bigger than a Bowtruckle.

145
00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.560
Seems only right that I should be...

146
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:03.780
...the one to take you away now.
- Yes, it's all very touching. Let's go.

147
00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.000
- Head for the Burrows.
- We'll rendezvous there.

148
00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:23.630
On the count of three.

149
00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.510
Hold tight, Harry.

150
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:27.470
One...

151
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.140
...two...

152
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.350
...three!

153
00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:11.510
- Which one?
- Where are you?

154
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.470
He's on your right!

155
00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.260
He's over there!

156
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:18.100
Down!

157
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.230
Hagrid, we have to help the others!

158
00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:28.530
I can't do that, Harry. Mad-Eye's orders.

159
00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:37.290
Hang on.

160
00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.170
Stupefy!

161
00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:57.970
Hang on, Harry.

162
00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.730
Hagrid.

163
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.250
No. No.

164
00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.320
Harry.

165
00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:16.360
Harry. Hagrid.

166
00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:21.200
What happened? Where are the others?

167
00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:22.530
Is no one else back?

168
00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.290
They were on us right from
the start, Molly. We didn't stand a chance.

169
00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.620
Well, thank goodness
you two are all right.

170
00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:32.380
The Death Eaters were
waiting for us. It was an ambush.

171
00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.920
Ron and Tonks
should've already been back.

172
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:36.300
Dad and Fred as well.

173
00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.890
Here!

174
00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:44.970
Quick. Into the house.

175
00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.730
Oh, my boy.

176
00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.400
Oh. Oh.

177
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:58.280
- Lupin!
- What are you doing?

178
00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.740
What creature sat in the corner...

179
00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:07.250
...the first time Harry Potter
visited my office in Hogwarts?

180
00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:09.040
- Are you mad?
- What creature?!

181
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:11.040
A Grindylow.

182
00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.050
We've been betrayed.

183
00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.590
Voldemort knew
you were being moved tonight.

184
00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.680
I had to make sure
you weren't an impostor.

185
00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:33.270
Wait.

186
00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:40.780
The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke
to the pair of us?

187
00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:46.950
"Harry is the best hope we have.
Trust him."

188
00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:52.620
What gave you away?

189
00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:55.920
Hedwig, I think.
She was trying to protect me.

190
00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.690
Thanks.

191
00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:16.020
Deserves that. Brilliant, he was.

192
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:19.320
- I wouldn't be standing here without him.
- Really?

193
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.990
Always the tone of surprise.

194
00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.370
We the last back?

195
00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:34.710
Where's George?

196
00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:58.230
How you feeling, Georgie?

197
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:01.780
Saint-like.

198
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:04.200
Come again?

199
00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.700
Saint-like. I'm holy.

200
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.290
I'm holey, Fred. Get it?

201
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.790
The whole wide world of ear-related humor
and you go for "I'm holey."

202
00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.130
That's pathetic.

203
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:23.050
Reckon I'm still better-looking than you.

204
00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:28.760
Mad-Eye's dead.

205
00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:42.900
Mundungus took one look at Voldemort
and Disapparated.

206
00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.840
Head for the Burrows.

207
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.010
This is beyond anything I imagined.

208
00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.810
- Seven?
- Seven...? A Horcrux.

209
00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:14.430
They could be hidden anywhere.

210
00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.770
To rip the soul into seven pieces...

211
00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.940
- If you did destroy each Horcrux...
- One destroys Voldemort.

212
00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:25.150
Trust me.

213
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:29.660
You lied to me. Lied to me, Ollivander.

214
00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:03.520
Going somewhere?

215
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:11.320
Nobody else is going to die. Not for me.

216
00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:13.280
For you?

217
00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:15.660
You think Mad-Eye died for you?

218
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:18.790
You think George took that curse
for you?

219
00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:23.500
You may be the Chosen One, mate,
but this is a whole lot bigger than that.

220
00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:26.170
It's always been bigger than that.

221
00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.880
- Come with me.
- What, and leave Hermione?

222
00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:35.600
You mad?
We wouldn't last two days without her.

223
00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:38.520
Don't tell her I said that.

224
00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.310
Besides, you've still got
the Trace on you.

225
00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:47.570
- We've still got the wedding...
- I don't care about a wedding.

226
00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:52.610
I'm sorry. No matter whose it is.
I have to start finding these Horcruxes.

227
00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:54.740
They're our only chance to beat him...

228
00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:57.870
...and the longer we stay here,
the stronger he gets.

229
00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:01.410
Tonight's not the night, mate.

230
00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:04.210
We'd only be doing him a favor.

231
00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:33.900
Do you think he knows?

232
00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:40.490
I mean, they're bits of his soul,
these Horcruxes. Bits of him.

233
00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:45.500
When Dumbledore destroyed the ring,
you destroyed Tom Riddle's diary...

234
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.590
...he must have felt something.

235
00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:54.090
To kill the other Horcruxes,
we have to find them.

236
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:56.430
Where are they?

237
00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:59.060
Where do we start?

238
00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.600
Ready when you are.

239
00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:09.610
- Please pay attention!
- It's your brother's wedding. Buck up.

240
00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:37.130
Zip me up, will you?

241
00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.900
It seems silly, doesn't it, a wedding?

242
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.780
Given everything that's going on.

243
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:59.120
Maybe that's the best reason to have it...

244
00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:02.330
...because of everything that's going on.

245
00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.510
Morning.

246
00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:32.860
Come on, keep up.

247
00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:35.190
All together now.

248
00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:40.820
One, two, three.

249
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.340
How's it looking at your end, boys?

250
00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.880
Brilliant.

251
00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:02.850
Bloody hell.
What's the Minister of Magic doing here?

252
00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:10.600
To what do we owe the pleasure,
Minister?

253
00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:15.360
I think we both know the answer
to that question, Mr. Potter.

254
00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:24.910
And this is...?

255
00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.880
"Herein is set forth
the last will and testament..."

256
00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:41.630
...of Albus Percival Wulfric
Brian Dumbledore.

257
00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:45.260
First, to Ronald Bilius Weasley...

258
00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:49.770
...I leave my Deluminator...

259
00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.190
...a device of my own making...

260
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:57.610
...in the hope that,
when things seem most dark...

261
00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:02.110
"...it will show him the light."

262
00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:11.120
- Dumbledore left this for me?
- Yeah.

263
00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.620
Brilliant.

264
00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:16.500
What is it?

265
00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.270
Wicked.

266
00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.520
"To Hermione Jean Granger..."

267
00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:40.860
...I leave my copy of
The Tales of Beedle the Bard...

268
00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:45.700
"...in the hope that she find it
entertaining and instructive."

269
00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:47.830
Mom used to read me those.

270
00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.240
"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot."

271
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:53.330
"Babbitty Rabbitty
and the Cackling Stump."

272
00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:58.500
Come on, Babbitty Rabbitty.

273
00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.670
No?

274
00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:03.800
"To Harry James Potter..."

275
00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:08.050
...I leave the Snitch he caught
in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts...

276
00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:13.270
...as a reminder
of the rewards of perseverance...

277
00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.690
"...and skill."

278
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:40.840
- Is that it, then?
- Not quite.

279
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.380
Dumbledore left you a second bequest:

280
00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:49.640
The sword of Godric Gryffindor.

281
00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:55.850
Unfortunately, the sword of Gryffindor
was not Dumbledore's to give away.

282
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:58.980
As an important historical artifact,
it belongs...

283
00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:00.230
To Harry.

284
00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:03.030
It belongs to Harry.

285
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:05.900
It came to him when he needed it
in the Chamber of Secrets.

286
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:08.950
The sword may present itself
to any worthy Gryffindor.

287
00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.450
That does not make it
that wizard's property.

288
00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:16.540
And, in any event, the current
whereabouts of the sword are unknown.

289
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:19.290
- Excuse me?
- The sword is missing.

290
00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:24.210
I don't know what you're up to,
Mr. Potter...

291
00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:28.340
...but you can't fight this war
on your own.

292
00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:30.930
He's too strong.

293
00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.370
Hello, Harry.

294
00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:38.290
I've interrupted a deep thought, haven't I?
I can see it growing smaller in your eyes.

295
00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:40.000
Of course not. How are you, Luna?

296
00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:42.790
Very well. Got bitten by a garden gnome
only moments ago.

297
00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.290
Gnome saliva is very beneficial.

298
00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.840
Xenophilius Lovegood.
We live just over the hill.

299
00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:49.170
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

300
00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:52.130
I trust you know, Mr. Potter,
that we at The Quibbler...

301
00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:54.640
...unlike those toadies
at The Daily Prophet...

302
00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.390
...fully supported Dumbledore
in his lifetime...

303
00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.230
...and, in his death,
support you just as fully.

304
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:02.900
Thank you.

305
00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:05.900
Come, Daddy.
Harry doesn't want to talk to us right now.

306
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:08.360
He's just too polite to say so.

307
00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:10.610
Harry Potter.

308
00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.280
Excuse me, sir? May I sit down?

309
00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:19.870
Mr. Potter. By all means. Here.

310
00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.710
Thanks.

311
00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:27.710
I found what you wrote
in The Daily Prophet really moving.

312
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:31.050
You obviously knew Dumbledore well.

313
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:34.180
Well, I certainly knew him the longest.

314
00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:37.050
That is, if you don't count his brother,
Aberforth...

315
00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:40.270
...and somehow, people never do
seem to count Aberforth.

316
00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.680
- I didn't even know he had a brother.
- Ah.

317
00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:46.400
Well, Dumbledore was always
very private, even as a boy.

318
00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.980
Don't despair, Elphias.

319
00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:52.570
I'm told he's been thoroughly
unriddled by Rita Skeeter...

320
00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:55.570
...in 800 pages, no less.

321
00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:00.620
Word has it that someone talked to her.

322
00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:03.580
Someone who knew
the Dumbledore family well.

323
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.580
Both you and I know who that is,
Elphias.

324
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:09.250
A monstrous betrayal.

325
00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:12.760
Who are we talking about?

326
00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:16.340
Bathilda Bagshot.

327
00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:19.100
- Who?
- My God, boy...

328
00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:24.020
...she's only the most celebrated
magical historian of the last century.

329
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:29.940
She was as close
to the Dumbledores as anyone.

330
00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:35.150
Oh, I'm sure Rita Skeeter thought
it well worth a trip to Godric's Hollow...

331
00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:38.530
...to take a peek
into that old bird's rattled cage.

332
00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:40.530
Godric's Hollow?

333
00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:42.870
Bathilda Bagshot
lives at Godric's Hollow?

334
00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:45.370
Well, that's where
she first met Dumbledore.

335
00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:47.420
You don't mean to say
he lived there too?

336
00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:51.130
The family moved there after his
father killed those three Muggles.

337
00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:54.970
Oh, it was quite the scandal.

338
00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:59.970
Honestly, my boy,
are you sure you knew him at all?

339
00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:29.500
The Ministry has fallen.

340
00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:34.050
The Minister of Magic is dead.

341
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:38.840
They are coming.

342
00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:43.850
They are coming.

343
00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:45.520
They're coming!

344
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.350
Nice meeting you, Mr. Potter.

345
00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:02.820
- Ginny!
- Harry! Go!

346
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:04.030
Go!

347
00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:19.970
Here you go, sightseeing tour?
Leaves in 15 minutes.

348
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:24.050
- Where are we?
- Shaftesbury Avenue.

349
00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:27.390
I used to come to the theater here
with Mom and Dad.

350
00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.810
I don't know why I thought of it.
It just popped into my head.

351
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:33.060
This way.

352
00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:38.940
We need to change.

353
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:46.160
How the ruddy...?

354
00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:48.910
Undetectable Extension Charm.

355
00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:51.580
You're amazing, you are.

356
00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:54.380
Always the tone of surprise.

357
00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.510
Ah. That'll be the books.

358
00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:05.890
What about all the people
at the wedding?

359
00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:08.520
- Do you think we should go back?
- They were after you.

360
00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:10.850
We'd put everyone in danger
by going back.

361
00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:14.440
- Ron's right.
- Ahem.

362
00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:16.270
Coffee?

363
00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:19.860
- A cappuccino, please.
- You?

364
00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:23.990
- What she said.
- Same.

365
00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:31.200
So where do we go from here?
Leaky Cauldron?

366
00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:32.660
It's too dangerous.

367
00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:37.130
If Voldemort has taken over the Ministry,
none of the old places are safe.

368
00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:40.340
Everyone from the wedding
will have gone underground, into hiding.

369
00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:43.010
My rucksack with all my things,
I've left it at the Burrow.

370
00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:50.060
You're joking.

371
00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:55.650
I've had all the essentials packed
for days, just in case.

372
00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:57.980
By the way, these jeans, not my favorite.

373
00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:00.230
Down!

374
00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.650
Stupefy!

375
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:08.620
Expulso!

376
00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.340
Petrificus Totalus.

377
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:25.550
Go.

378
00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:27.180
Leave.

379
00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:34.640
Lock the door, get the lights.

380
00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:45.610
This one's name is Rowle.

381
00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:49.530
He was on the Astronomy Tower
the night Snape killed Dumbledore.

382
00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:54.870
This is Dolohov. I recognize him
from the wanted posters.

383
00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.080
So, what we gonna do with you, hey?

384
00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:01.040
Kill us if it was turned round,
wouldn't you?

385
00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:02.550
If we kill them, they'll know we were here.

386
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:04.130
Ron.

387
00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:08.260
Suppose he did Mad-Eye.
How would you feel then?

388
00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:11.890
It's better we wipe their memories.

389
00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.720
You're the boss.

390
00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.770
Hermione...

391
00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:21.730
...you're the best at spells.

392
00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:41.590
Obliviate.

393
00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:55.520
How is it they knew we were there?

394
00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.270
Maybe you still have the Trace on you?

395
00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.900
Can't be. Trace breaks at 17.
It's wizarding law.

396
00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:04.270
What?

397
00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:08.030
We didn't celebrate your birthday, Harry.

398
00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.660
Ginny and I, we prepared a cake.

399
00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:14.780
We were going to bring it out
at the end of the wedding.

400
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:18.410
I appreciate the thought, but given the
fact that we were almost killed...

401
00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:20.960
...by a couple of Death Eaters
a few minutes ago...

402
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:24.340
Right.

403
00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:26.170
Perspective.

404
00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:29.340
We need to get off the streets,
get somewhere safe.

405
00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:04.500
What was that all about?

406
00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:11.300
Probably Mad-Eye's idea,
in case Snape decided to come snooping.

407
00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:21.430
Homenum Revelio.

408
00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:29.900
We're alone.

409
00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:38.950
I believed another wand...

410
00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.580
- You lied to me.
- It makes no sense.

411
00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:47.380
I believed a different wand would work,
I swear.

412
00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:50.960
There must be another way.

413
00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:05.040
Harry? Hermione, where are you?

414
00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:07.620
I think I've found something.

415
00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:14.960
Lovely.

416
00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:24.180
"Regulus Arcturus Black."

417
00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:26.060
R.A.B.

418
00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:32.980
"I know I will be dead
long before you read this."

419
00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:37.150
"I have stolen the real Horcrux
and intend to destroy it."

420
00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:39.950
R.A.B. is Sirius's brother.

421
00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:42.160
Yes.

422
00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:48.120
Question is,
did he actually destroy the real Horcrux?

423
00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:12.020
You've been spying on us, have you?

424
00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:16.650
Kreacher has been watching.

425
00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:18.740
Maybe he knows where the real locket is.

426
00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:23.700
Have you ever seen this before?

427
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:25.450
Kreacher?

428
00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:28.710
It's Master Regulus' locket.

429
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:31.580
But there were two, weren't there?

430
00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:34.290
Where's the other one?

431
00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:41.380
Kreacher doesn't know
where the other locket is.

432
00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:43.930
Yes, but did you ever see it?
Was it in this house?

433
00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:45.260
Filthy Mudblood.

434
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:47.140
- Death Eaters are coming...
- Ron.

435
00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:50.140
- Blood traitor, Weasley.
- Answer her.

436
00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:54.150
Yes.

437
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:58.650
It was here in this house.

438
00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:02.240
A most evil object.

439
00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:03.660
How do you mean?

440
00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:08.750
Before Master Regulus died,
he ordered Kreacher to destroy it...

441
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:14.170
...but no matter how hard Kreacher tried,
he could not do it.

442
00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:15.920
Well, where is it now?

443
00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:21.170
- Did someone take it?
- He came in the night.

444
00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:26.010
He took many things,
including the locket.

445
00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:27.720
Who did?

446
00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:29.970
Who was it, Kreacher?

447
00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:35.190
Mundungus.

448
00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:38.860
Mundungus Fletcher.

449
00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:41.530
Find him.

450
00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:04.510
My father will hear about this.

451
00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:11.680
Hey, losers.

452
00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:14.640
He isn't here.

453
00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:30.700
As your new Minister for Magic...

454
00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:36.080
...I promise to restore
this temple of tolerance...

455
00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:37.920
...to its former glory.

456
00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:41.170
Therefore, beginning today...

457
00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:46.010
...each employee
will submit themselves...

458
00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:48.890
...for evaluation.

459
00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.770
You have nothing to fear...

460
00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:55.940
...if you have nothing to hide.

461
00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:01.940
- How much?
- Two Galleons.

462
00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:04.610
Come on, time is money. Cheers, pal.

463
00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:06.700
- Snatchers!
- Move out of the way.

464
00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:14.370
- I told you.
- Get out.

465
00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:15.580
Squash him.

466
00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.420
Be a bit gentler.

467
00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:54.660
They have flesh memories.

468
00:47:56.790 --> 00:48:02.340
When Scrimgeour first gave it to you,
I thought it might open at your touch.

469
00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:05.920
That Dumbledore had hidden
something inside it.

470
00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:07.840
Many of you are wondering...

471
00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:10.930
...why Voldemort has yet to show himself
now that he has vanquished...

472
00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:14.180
...the most powerful symbol of opposition
to him and his followers.

473
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:17.270
Get off.

474
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:20.190
Harry Potter, so long it's been.

475
00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:21.980
Get off me.

476
00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:31.530
As requested,
Kreacher has returned with the thief...

477
00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:33.700
- Expelliarmus.
- ...Mundungus Fletcher.

478
00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:37.080
What you playing at? Setting a pair
of bleeding house-elves after me.

479
00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:38.750
Dobby was only trying to help.

480
00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:43.290
Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley,
which Dobby thought was curious.

481
00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:47.800
And then Dobby heard Kreacher
mention Harry Potter's name.

482
00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:50.800
- I just...
- And then Dobby saw Kreacher...

483
00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:53.760
...talking with the thief, Mundungus...
- I'm no thief.

484
00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:56.850
You foul little... Git.

485
00:48:57.270 --> 00:49:01.640
I'm a purveyor
of rare and wondrous objects.

486
00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:03.690
You're a thief, Dung. Everyone knows it.

487
00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:06.820
Master Weasley,
so good to see you again.

488
00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:08.030
Wicked trainers.

489
00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:12.530
Listen, I panicked that night, all right?

490
00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:16.410
Could I help it
if Mad-Eye fell off his broom?

491
00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:19.830
- You...
- Tell the truth.

492
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.790
When you turned this place over...
Don't deny it.

493
00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.500
...You found a locket, am I right?

494
00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:26.920
Why? Was it valuable?

495
00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:28.210
You still got it?

496
00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:30.840
No, he's worried
he didn't get enough money for it.

497
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:32.510
Bleeding give it away, didn't I?

498
00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:37.010
There I was,
flogging me wares in Diagon Alley...

499
00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:41.180
...when some Ministry hag comes up
and asks to see me license.

500
00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:43.480
Says she's a mind to lock me up.

501
00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:47.320
And would've done it too,
if she hadn't taken a fancy to that locket.

502
00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:51.400
- Who was she? The witch. Do you know?
- No, I...

503
00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:59.620
Well, she's there. Look.

504
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:04.120
Bleeding bow and all.

505
00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:48.750
Right, remember what we said.

506
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.760
Don't speak to anyone
unless absolutely necessary.

507
00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:57.930
Just try and act normal.
Do what everybody else is doing.

508
00:50:58.350 --> 00:51:01.470
If we do that, then with a bit of luck,
we'll get inside.

509
00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:03.270
- And then...
- it gets really tricky.

510
00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:05.270
- Correct.
- Yeah.

511
00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:08.350
- This is completely mental.
- Completely.

512
00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:10.560
The world's mental.

513
00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:12.150
Come on...

514
00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:15.190
...we've got a Horcrux to find.

515
00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:11.500
We flush ourselves in.

516
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:18.300
That's bloody disgusting.

517
00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:48.000
Name?

518
00:52:49.290 --> 00:52:50.830
You. Come.

519
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.170
- What? What?
- Come on.

520
00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:55.750
- What did I do?
- Just keep walking.

521
00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:05.050
- Are those...?
- Muggles.

522
00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:09.850
In their rightful place.

523
00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:14.810
Gotta tell you,
I'm starting to freak out a bit.

524
00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:21.570
How long did you say this batch
of Polyjuice would last, Hermione?

525
00:53:22.110 --> 00:53:23.160
I didn't.

526
00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:32.250
Cattermole.

527
00:53:33.290 --> 00:53:36.920
It's still raining inside my office.
That's two days now.

528
00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:40.590
Have you tried an umbrella?

529
00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:44.510
You do realize I'm going downstairs,
don't you, Cattermole?

530
00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:49.060
- Downstairs?
- To interrogate your wife.

531
00:53:49.930 --> 00:53:53.890
Now, if my wife's blood status
were in doubt...

532
00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:56.940
...and the head of the Department
of Magical Law Enforcement...

533
00:53:57.110 --> 00:54:02.700
...needed a job doing,
I think I might just make that a priority.

534
00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:05.450
You have one hour.

535
00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:22.880
Oh, my God. What am I gonna do?
My wife's all alone downstairs.

536
00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:27.470
- Ron, you don't have a wife.
- Oh, right.

537
00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:29.600
Level 2.

538
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:32.520
But how do I stop it raining?

539
00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:35.310
Try "Finite Incantatem."

540
00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:37.310
Department of Magical Law Enforcement...

541
00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:38.940
...and Improper Use of Magic Department.

542
00:54:39.110 --> 00:54:41.070
This is you, Ron.

543
00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:50.160
Finite Incantatem. Okay.
And if that doesn't work...?

544
00:55:02.050 --> 00:55:05.010
Level 1,
Minister of Magic and support staff.

545
00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:07.300
If we don't locate Umbridge
within the hour...

546
00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:09.470
...we go find Ron
and come back another day.

547
00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:10.680
- Deal?
- Yes.

548
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:16.560
Ah, Mafalda. Travers sent you, did he?

549
00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:19.810
Good, we'll go straight down.

550
00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:24.690
Albert, aren't you getting out?

551
00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:00.060
Runcorn.

552
00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:53.950
Accio locket.

553
00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:51.840
- All right, all right.
- Let's calm down, shall we?

554
00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:55.180
Let's get back to work, please.

555
00:57:56.010 --> 00:57:57.850
Calm down.

556
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:04.850
Runcorn.

557
00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:14.450
Morning.

558
00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:18.580
Ron, it's me.

559
00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:22.580
Harry.
Blimey, forgot what you looked like.

560
00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:24.210
Where's Hermione?

561
00:58:24.370 --> 00:58:27.790
She's gone down to the courtrooms,
with Umbridge.

562
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:36.760
Bloody cold down here.

563
00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:40.560
I'm a half-blood. My father was a wizard.

564
00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:42.980
William Alderton.
He worked here for 30 years.

565
00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:46.650
Perhaps you know him.
Always wore his jacket inside out.

566
00:58:46.810 --> 00:58:49.270
No, there's been a mistake.
I'm half-blood, you see.

567
00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:52.650
We must go back. I'm half-blood.

568
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:04.870
- Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?
- Yes.

569
00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:09.960
Of 27 Chislehurst Gardens,
Great Tolling, Evesham?

570
00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:11.170
- Yes.
- It's here.

571
00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:16.130
Mother to Maisie, Ellie and Alfred?
Wife to Reginald?

572
00:59:20.350 --> 00:59:21.430
Reg?

573
00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:34.820
Thank you, Albert.

574
00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:40.160
Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?

575
00:59:42.370 --> 00:59:43.450
Yes.

576
00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:48.000
A wand was taken from you
upon your arrival at the Ministry today.

577
00:59:48.170 --> 00:59:50.960
Is this that wand?

578
00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:57.300
Would you please tell the court from which
witch or wizard you took this wand?

579
00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:59.930
I didn't take it.

580
01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:06.980
I got it in Diagon Alley, at Ollivander's,
when I was 11.

581
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:10.900
It chose me.

582
01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:14.020
You're lying.

583
01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:19.030
Wands only choose witches,
and you are not a witch.

584
01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.240
But I am.

585
01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:24.740
Tell them, Reg. Tell them what I am.

586
01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:28.660
Reg, tell them what I am.

587
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:40.380
What on earth are you doing, Albert?

588
01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:45.180
You're lying, Dolores.

589
01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:50.140
And one mustn't tell lies.

590
01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:52.230
Stupefy!

591
01:00:59.950 --> 01:01:01.320
It's Harry Potter.

592
01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:03.950
It is, isn't it?
This'll be one to tell the kids.

593
01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:21.130
Expecto Patronum!

594
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:47.410
Oh. Oh. Oh.

595
01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:49.620
Mary, go home.

596
01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:52.540
Get the kids.

597
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:56.080
I'll meet you there. We have to get out
of the country, understand?

598
01:01:56.250 --> 01:01:58.710
Mary, do as I say.

599
01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:14.270
Mary?

600
01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:17.810
Who's that?

601
01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:21.940
Long story. Nice meeting you.

602
01:02:22.110 --> 01:02:23.490
It's Harry Potter.

603
01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.160
It's Harry. Harry Potter.

604
01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:28.370
- There he is.
- Get him!

605
01:02:28.530 --> 01:02:30.620
- Get him!
- Stop him!

606
01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:43.720
- Watch out.
- Look out.

607
01:02:44.090 --> 01:02:45.470
This way!

608
01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:06.320
Expelliarmus!

609
01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:54.830
Oh, my God.

610
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.620
Shh, shh, shh. It's all right. It's okay.

611
01:04:01.090 --> 01:04:04.300
Harry. Harry, quickly, in my bag.

612
01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:07.010
There's a bottle labeled
"Essence of Dittany."

613
01:04:09.550 --> 01:04:12.390
Shh. Shh.

614
01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:15.220
Okay, okay. Quickly.

615
01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:18.100
- Accio Dittany.
- Shh.

616
01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:21.230
It's all right. Unstopper it.

617
01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:22.810
Hermione, his arm.

618
01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:25.070
I know, just do it.

619
01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:27.530
It's okay.

620
01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:32.740
- Okay, it's gonna sting a little bit.
- What happened? I thought we meant...

621
01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:35.660
...to be going back to Grimmauld Place.
- We were. We were. Shh.

622
01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:37.660
It's all right. One more, one more.

623
01:04:37.830 --> 01:04:42.380
We were there, we were there,
but Yaxley had hold of me, and I...

624
01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:45.590
I knew once he'd seen where we were,
we couldn't stay...

625
01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:48.880
...so I brought us here...

626
01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:51.970
...but Ron got splinched.

627
01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:56.850
It's all right.

628
01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:18.290
Protege Totalum.

629
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:21.210
Salvio Hexia.

630
01:05:21.370 --> 01:05:22.790
What are you doing?

631
01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:25.250
Protective enchantments.

632
01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:29.010
I don't fancy another visit like the one
we had in Shaftesbury Avenue, do you?

633
01:05:29.170 --> 01:05:30.880
You can get going on the tent.

634
01:05:31.550 --> 01:05:33.390
- Tent?
- Protege Totalum.

635
01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:35.680
Where am I supposed to find a tent?

636
01:05:35.850 --> 01:05:40.140
Repello Muggletum. Muffliato.

637
01:05:50.490 --> 01:05:51.780
You first.

638
01:05:55.370 --> 01:05:57.490
Dissendium.

639
01:06:11.090 --> 01:06:13.010
Incendio.

640
01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:20.430
Expulso.

641
01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:29.770
Diffindo.

642
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:32.240
Reducto.

643
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:55.550
What are you doing?

644
01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:59.720
We have to keep it safe
until we find out how to destroy it.

645
01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:02.560
Seems strange, mate.
Dumbledore sends you off...

646
01:07:02.730 --> 01:07:06.520
...to find all these Horcruxes,
but doesn't tell you how to destroy them.

647
01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:08.310
Doesn't that bother you?

648
01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:24.080
A goblin by the name of Gornuk was killed.

649
01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:27.330
It is believed that Muggle-born
Dean Thomas and a second goblin...

650
01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:30.420
...both believed to have been traveling
with Tonks, Cresswell...

651
01:07:30.590 --> 01:07:32.130
...and Gornuk, may have escaped.

652
01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:36.090
If Dean is listening or anyone has
any knowledge of his whereabouts...

653
01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:39.300
...his parents and sisters
are desperate for news.

654
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:42.850
Meanwhile, a Muggle family of five
has been found dead in their home.

655
01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:46.270
You know the spell, Harry.

656
01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:51.270
Tell me.

657
01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:55.780
Tell me, Gregorovitch.

658
01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:57.570
It was stolen from me.

659
01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:01.200
Who was he? The thief?

660
01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:08.290
It was a boy. It was he who took it.

661
01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:10.960
I never saw it again.

662
01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:12.960
I swear on my life.

663
01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:14.960
I believe you.

664
01:08:20.970 --> 01:08:22.720
Avada Kedavra!

665
01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:38.860
I thought it had stopped.

666
01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:43.200
You can't keep letting him in, Harry.

667
01:08:45.290 --> 01:08:48.200
You-Know-Who has found Gregorovitch.

668
01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:50.080
The wandmaker?

669
01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:54.790
He wants something
that Gregorovitch used to have...

670
01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:56.420
...but I don't know what.

671
01:08:56.590 --> 01:09:02.590
But he wants it desperately.
I mean, it's as if his life depends on it.

672
01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.680
Don't.

673
01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:08.020
- It comforts him.
- It sets my teeth on edge.

674
01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:10.440
What's he expecting to hear,
good news?

675
01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:13.480
- -Who long expected it,
the fall of the Ministry was shocking.

676
01:09:13.650 --> 01:09:16.020
I think he just hopes
he doesn't hear bad news.

677
01:09:16.190 --> 01:09:18.110
We promise
to remain your eyes and ears...

678
01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:19.690
How long before he can travel?

679
01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:23.070
- -Bringing you news when we can,
from wherever we can.

680
01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:24.530
I'm doing everything I can.

681
01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:26.240
You're not doing enough!

682
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.040
Take it off.

683
01:09:31.790 --> 01:09:34.380
I said, take it off now.

684
01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:48.100
- Better?
- Loads.

685
01:09:51.810 --> 01:09:54.060
We'll take it in turns, okay?

686
01:10:23.130 --> 01:10:26.510
Finch does admit
his invention currently has one short.

687
01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:28.140
And now, other news:

688
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:31.600
Severus Snape, newly appointed
headmaster of Hogwarts...

689
01:10:31.770 --> 01:10:35.520
...has decreed that all students
must conform to the latest house rules.

690
01:11:03.130 --> 01:11:05.630
Hogwarts bears little resemblance
to the school...

691
01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:07.590
...under Dumbledore's leadership.

692
01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:11.390
Snape's curriculum is severe,
reflecting the wishes of the Dark Lord...

693
01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:17.150
...and infractions are dealt with harshly
by the two Death Eaters on staff.

694
01:11:36.670 --> 01:11:38.000
What's that?

695
01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:50.010
What's that smell?

696
01:12:12.490 --> 01:12:14.540
- What you doing?
- It's heavy.

697
01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:16.290
Oh, sorry. Do you want me to carry it?

698
01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:19.370
- Yeah, thank you.
- Don't be ridiculous. Pick it up.

699
01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.000
Numpty.

700
01:12:27.090 --> 01:12:29.090
Snatchers.

701
01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:32.550
Good to know your enchantments work.

702
01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:41.230
He could smell it. My perfume.

703
01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:45.530
I've told you...

704
01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:47.820
...Ron isn't strong enough to Apparate.

705
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:51.740
Well, then, we'll go on foot.

706
01:12:52.530 --> 01:12:57.450
And next time, Hermione, as much as
I like your perfume, just don't wear any.

707
01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:06.250
And now for the names
of missing witches and wizards.

708
01:13:07.090 --> 01:13:09.260
These are confirmed.

709
01:13:10.090 --> 01:13:13.470
Thankfully, the list is short today.

710
01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:16.260
Jason and Alison Denbright.

711
01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:18.180
Oh. Thank you.

712
01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:22.100
Bella, Jake, Charlie and Madge Farley.

713
01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:23.440
Joe Laurie.

714
01:13:24.770 --> 01:13:27.360
Eleanor Sarah Gibbs.

715
01:13:28.530 --> 01:13:31.820
Harry and Bronwyn Trigg.

716
01:13:33.450 --> 01:13:36.490
Rob and Ellie Dowson.

717
01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:40.120
Georgia Clark-Day.

718
01:13:40.710 --> 01:13:43.250
Joshua Flexson.

719
01:13:43.630 --> 01:13:45.130
George Coutas.

720
01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:49.130
Gabriella and Emily Mather.

721
01:13:50.130 --> 01:13:53.260
Jacob and Mimi Erland.

722
01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:55.800
William and Brian Gallagher.

723
01:13:55.970 --> 01:13:58.430
He doesn't know
what he's doing, does he?

724
01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:03.140
None of us do.

725
01:14:05.730 --> 01:14:08.480
Toby and Olivia Gleaves.

726
01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.990
Katie and James Killick.

727
01:14:12.150 --> 01:14:14.660
Elsie Valentine Schroeder.

728
01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:17.830
Jennifer Winston.

729
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:21.120
Tamsin and Iola Hillicker.

730
01:14:22.330 --> 01:14:23.330
Scarlet and Kitty Sharp.

731
01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:44.190
Oh, my God.

732
01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:46.190
What?

733
01:14:46.730 --> 01:14:48.770
I'll tell you in a minute.

734
01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:52.030
Maybe you could tell me now.

735
01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:55.400
The sword of Gryffindor,
it's goblin-made.

736
01:14:55.570 --> 01:14:56.700
Brilliant.

737
01:14:57.740 --> 01:15:00.160
No, you don't understand.

738
01:15:00.490 --> 01:15:02.870
Dirt and rust have no effect
on the blade.

739
01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:07.210
It only takes in
that which makes it stronger.

740
01:15:07.630 --> 01:15:09.000
Okay.

741
01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:12.670
Harry, you've already destroyed
one Horcrux, right?

742
01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:15.090
Tom Riddle's diary
in the Chamber of Secrets.

743
01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:18.180
With a Basilisk fang.
If you tell me you've got one of those...

744
01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:21.810
...in that bloody beaded bag of yours...
- Don't you see?

745
01:15:21.970 --> 01:15:25.730
In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed
the Basilisk with the sword of Gryffindor.

746
01:15:25.890 --> 01:15:29.400
Its blade is impregnated
with Basilisk venom.

747
01:15:29.570 --> 01:15:31.690
It only takes in
that which makes it stronger.

748
01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:35.030
- Exactly, which is why...
- it can destroy Horcruxes.

749
01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:37.450
That's why Dumbledore left it to you
in his will.

750
01:15:37.610 --> 01:15:42.030
You are brilliant, Hermione. Truly.

751
01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:46.250
Actually, I'm highly logical, which
allows me to look past extraneous detail...

752
01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:48.920
...and perceive clearly
that which others overlook.

753
01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:51.790
Yeah, there's only one problem,
of course.

754
01:15:57.180 --> 01:15:59.300
The sword was stolen.

755
01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:03.260
Yeah, I'm still here.

756
01:16:03.770 --> 01:16:07.890
But you two carry on.
Don't let me spoil the fun.

757
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:13.270
- What's wrong?
- Wrong? Nothing's wrong.

758
01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:15.320
Not according to you, anyway.

759
01:16:15.490 --> 01:16:19.110
Look, if you've got something to say,
don't be shy. Spit it out.

760
01:16:19.490 --> 01:16:22.780
All right, I'll spit it out.
But don't expect me to be grateful...

761
01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:25.490
...because there's another damn thing
we've gotta find.

762
01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:27.960
I thought you knew
what you signed up for.

763
01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:30.290
Yeah. I thought I did too.

764
01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:33.500
Well, then I'm sorry,
but I don't quite understand.

765
01:16:33.670 --> 01:16:37.130
What part of this isn't living up
to your expectations?

766
01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:39.590
Did you think we were gonna
be staying in a hotel?

767
01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:43.010
Finding a Horcrux every other day?
Thought you'd be back by Christmas?

768
01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:45.010
I just thought, after all this time...

769
01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:48.640
...we would've achieved something.
I thought you knew what you were doing.

770
01:16:48.810 --> 01:16:51.190
I thought Dumbledore told you
something worthwhile.

771
01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:54.570
- I thought you had a plan.
- I told you everything Dumbledore told me.

772
01:16:54.730 --> 01:16:56.940
In case you haven't noticed,
we found a Horcrux.

773
01:16:57.110 --> 01:17:00.990
Yeah, and we're as close to getting rid of
it as we are to finding the rest of them.

774
01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:03.740
Ron. Please, take...

775
01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:06.660
Take the Horcrux off.
You wouldn't be saying this...

776
01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:08.160
...if you hadn't been wearing it all day.

777
01:17:08.330 --> 01:17:10.750
Want to know why I listen to that radio?

778
01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:15.590
To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name,
or Fred, or George or Mom.

779
01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:18.840
You think I'm not listening?
You think I don't know how this feels?!

780
01:17:19.130 --> 01:17:20.550
No, you don't know how it feels!

781
01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:23.090
Your parents are dead.
You have no family.

782
01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:26.930
- Stop. Stop.
- Fine, then go!

783
01:17:27.770 --> 01:17:28.930
Go, then!

784
01:17:31.850 --> 01:17:32.850
Fine.

785
01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:37.690
Ron.

786
01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:42.700
And you?

787
01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:46.990
Are you coming or you staying?

788
01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:57.170
Fine. I get it.

789
01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:59.760
I saw you two the other night.

790
01:18:00.170 --> 01:18:02.590
Ron, that's... That's nothing.

791
01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:06.100
Ron...

792
01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:11.640
Ron, where are you going?

793
01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:14.900
Please, come back.

794
01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:18.070
Ron.

795
01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:23.780
Ron!

796
01:19:26.090 --> 01:19:28.720
Salvio Hexia.

797
01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:34.640
Repellum Muggletum.

798
01:19:37.690 --> 01:19:40.150
Salvio Hexia.

799
01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:04.130
Poor old Jim's white as a ghost

800
01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:08.130
He's found the answer that we lost

801
01:20:08.510 --> 01:20:11.970
We're all weeping now
Weeping because

802
01:20:12.510 --> 01:20:18.100
There ain't nothing we can do
To protect you

803
01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:21.980
O children

804
01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:28.500
Lift up your voice

805
01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:37.710
Children

806
01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:47.170
Rejoice, rejoice

807
01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:50.720
Hey, little train, we're jumping on

808
01:20:50.890 --> 01:20:54.640
The train that goes to the kingdom

809
01:20:55.180 --> 01:20:58.350
We're happy, Ma
We're having fun

810
01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:02.650
And the train ain't even left the station

811
01:21:02.810 --> 01:21:06.190
Hey, little train, wait for me

812
01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:10.240
I once was blind but now I see

813
01:21:10.410 --> 01:21:13.740
Have you left a seat for me?

814
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:18.040
Is that such a stretch of the imagination?

815
01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:21.540
Hey, little train, wait for me

816
01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:25.590
I was held in chains but now I'm free

817
01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:28.760
I'm hanging in there
Don't you see?

818
01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:33.430
In this process of elimination

819
01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:36.720
Hey, little train, we're jumping on

820
01:21:36.930 --> 01:21:40.430
The train that goes to the kingdom

821
01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:44.310
We're happy, Ma
We're having fun

822
01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:48.400
It's beyond my wildest expectation

823
01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:51.780
Hey, little train, we're jumping on

824
01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:55.620
The train that goes to the kingdom

825
01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:59.330
We're happy, Ma
We're having fun

826
01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:04.380
The train ain't even left the station

827
01:22:51.090 --> 01:22:52.590
Hermione.

828
01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:55.090
Hermione? You were right.

829
01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:56.840
Snitches have flesh memories...

830
01:22:57.010 --> 01:23:01.640
...but I didn't catch the first Snitch
with my hand, I almost swallowed it.

831
01:23:06.900 --> 01:23:09.690
- "I open at the close."
- What do you think that means?

832
01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:11.230
I don't know.

833
01:23:13.650 --> 01:23:16.030
I found something as well.

834
01:23:22.410 --> 01:23:25.870
At first I thought it was an eye,
but now I don't think it is.

835
01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:30.210
It isn't a rune, and it isn't anywhere
in Spellman's Syllabary.

836
01:23:30.710 --> 01:23:33.800
Somebody inked it in. It isn't part
of the book. Somebody drew it.

837
01:23:33.970 --> 01:23:37.630
Luna's dad was wearing that
at Bill and Fleur's wedding.

838
01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:43.680
Why would someone draw it
in a children's book?

839
01:23:46.270 --> 01:23:48.730
Look, Hermione, I've been thinking.

840
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:51.400
I want to go to Godric's Hollow.

841
01:23:51.570 --> 01:23:54.610
It's where I was born.
It's where my parents died.

842
01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:58.410
That's exactly where he'll expect you to go
because it means something to you.

843
01:23:58.570 --> 01:24:00.990
Yeah, but it means something to him too,
Hermione.

844
01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:03.160
You-Know-Who almost died there.

845
01:24:03.330 --> 01:24:08.000
I mean, isn't that exactly the type of
place he'd be likely to hide a Horcrux?

846
01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:11.540
It's dangerous, Harry.

847
01:24:13.130 --> 01:24:17.130
But even I have to admit, recently
I've been thinking we'll have to go there.

848
01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:19.760
I think it's possible
something else is hidden there.

849
01:24:19.930 --> 01:24:21.430
What?

850
01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:23.850
The sword.

851
01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:28.230
If Dumbledore wanted you to find it, but
didn't want it in the Ministry's hands...

852
01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:32.610
...where better to hide it than the
birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor?

853
01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:35.780
Hermione...

854
01:24:41.030 --> 01:24:43.780
Don't ever let me
give you a haircut again.

855
01:25:05.010 --> 01:25:07.680
I still think we should've used
Polyjuice Potion.

856
01:25:07.850 --> 01:25:09.390
No.

857
01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:12.270
This is where I was born.

858
01:25:12.610 --> 01:25:14.980
I'm not returning as someone else.

859
01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:27.830
Good night. Ha-ha-ha.

860
01:25:30.830 --> 01:25:33.630
Harry, I think it's Christmas Eve.

861
01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:36.420
Listen.

862
01:25:42.140 --> 01:25:44.970
Do you think they'd be in there,
Hermione?

863
01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:47.390
My mom and dad.

864
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:55.610
Yeah, I think they would.

865
01:26:32.190 --> 01:26:35.230
"Ignotus Peverell."

866
01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:38.940
Hey, Harry?

867
01:27:16.810 --> 01:27:19.020
Merry Christmas, Hermione.

868
01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:22.570
Merry Christmas, Harry.

869
01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:47.800
Harry, there's someone
watching us. By the church.

870
01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:00.360
I think I know who that is.

871
01:28:02.230 --> 01:28:03.650
I don't like this, Harry.

872
01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:08.860
Hermione, she knew
Dumbledore. She might have the sword.

873
01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:29.340
This is where they died, Hermione.

874
01:28:36.930 --> 01:28:39.390
This is where he murdered them.

875
01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:53.870
You're Bathilda, aren't you?

876
01:28:59.460 --> 01:29:01.540
Here, let me do that.

877
01:29:25.690 --> 01:29:29.570
Miss Bagshot, who is this man?

878
01:29:41.210 --> 01:29:42.870
Harry.

879
01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:48.760
Lumos.

880
01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:30.190
Harry!

881
01:32:20.990 --> 01:32:22.080
Confringo!

882
01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:06.950
Are you feeling better?

883
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.460
You've outdone yourself this time,
Hermione.

884
01:33:12.630 --> 01:33:14.750
The Forest of Dean.

885
01:33:15.710 --> 01:33:20.090
I came here once with Mom and Dad,
years ago.

886
01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:22.840
It's just how I remember it.

887
01:33:23.260 --> 01:33:27.180
The trees, the river, everything.

888
01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:30.310
Like nothing's changed.

889
01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:34.560
Not true, of course.
Everything's changed.

890
01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:39.320
If I brought my parents back here now,
they probably wouldn't recognize any of it.

891
01:33:41.450 --> 01:33:45.580
Not the trees, not the river...

892
01:33:47.330 --> 01:33:49.500
...not even me.

893
01:33:54.630 --> 01:33:57.420
Maybe we should just stay here, Harry.

894
01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:01.550
Grow old.

895
01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:10.850
You wanted to know
who the boy in the photograph was.

896
01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:12.690
I know.

897
01:34:13.850 --> 01:34:16.270
Gellert Grindelwald.

898
01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:26.620
He's the thief I saw
in Gregorovitch's Wand Shop.

899
01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:30.040
Speaking of which, where is my wand?

900
01:34:31.370 --> 01:34:33.790
Where's my wand, Hermione?

901
01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:46.930
As we were leaving Godric's Hollow,
I cast a curse and it rebounded.

902
01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:50.890
I'm sorry.

903
01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:54.230
- I tried to mend it, but wands are different.
- It's done.

904
01:34:56.190 --> 01:35:00.150
Leave me yours.
Go inside and get warm.

905
01:35:00.570 --> 01:35:02.900
I'll take the locket as well.

906
01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:16.790
Trust me.

907
01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:44.170
Lumos.

908
01:37:25.250 --> 01:37:26.630
Accio sword.

909
01:37:32.470 --> 01:37:34.390
Diffindo.

910
01:39:14.820 --> 01:39:17.990
- Hermione?
- Are you mental?

911
01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:20.740
It was you?

912
01:39:20.910 --> 01:39:24.660
Well, yeah. Bit obvious, I think.

913
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:26.670
And you cast the doe as well, did you?

914
01:39:27.210 --> 01:39:30.880
- No, I thought that was you.
- No, my Patronus is a stag.

915
01:39:31.050 --> 01:39:33.260
Right. Yeah. Antlers.

916
01:39:36.430 --> 01:39:39.600
Okay, Ron. Do it.

917
01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:44.310
I can't handle it. That thing affects me
more than it affects you and Hermione.

918
01:39:44.850 --> 01:39:47.480
- All the more reason.
- No. I can't.

919
01:39:47.650 --> 01:39:48.860
Then why are you here?

920
01:39:50.270 --> 01:39:52.360
Why did you come back?

921
01:39:59.910 --> 01:40:04.040
Now, I'll have to speak to it in order for
it to open. When it does, don't hesitate.

922
01:40:04.660 --> 01:40:07.210
I don't know what's in there,
but it'll put up a fight.

923
01:40:07.370 --> 01:40:10.040
The bit of Riddle that was in that diary
tried to kill me.

924
01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:15.630
All right. One...

925
01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:18.300
...two...

926
01:40:18.970 --> 01:40:20.890
...three.

927
01:40:31.110 --> 01:40:36.240
I have seen your heart, and it is mine.

928
01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:42.740
I have seen your dreams,
Ronald Weasley...

929
01:40:42.910 --> 01:40:45.290
...and I have seen your fears.

930
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:51.170
Least loved by your mother,
who craved a daughter.

931
01:40:51.790 --> 01:40:56.800
Least loved by the girl
who prefers your friend.

932
01:40:56.970 --> 01:40:59.720
Ron, kill it!

933
01:41:06.140 --> 01:41:08.850
We were better without you.

934
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:11.100
Happier without you.

935
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:16.610
Who could look at you
compared to Harry Potter?

936
01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:21.200
What are you
compared with the Chosen One?

937
01:41:21.370 --> 01:41:22.530
Ron, it's lying!

938
01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:25.700
Your mother confessed
she would have preferred me as a son.

939
01:41:25.870 --> 01:41:28.870
What woman would take you?

940
01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:32.250
You are nothing.

941
01:41:32.420 --> 01:41:33.540
Nothing.

942
01:41:34.290 --> 01:41:38.340
Nothing compared to him.

943
01:42:28.890 --> 01:42:30.560
Just think...

944
01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:33.560
...only three to go.

945
01:42:36.610 --> 01:42:38.360
Hermione?

946
01:42:40.610 --> 01:42:42.360
Hermione?

947
01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:48.830
Is everything all right?

948
01:42:49.450 --> 01:42:54.120
It's fine.
Actually, you know, it's more than fine.

949
01:42:58.550 --> 01:43:00.170
Hey.

950
01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:10.600
You complete ass, Ronald Weasley!

951
01:43:10.770 --> 01:43:14.440
You show up here after weeks,
and you say "hey"?

952
01:43:16.650 --> 01:43:19.400
- Where's my wand? Where's my wand?
- I don't know.

953
01:43:19.570 --> 01:43:21.820
- Harry Potter, give me my wand.
- I don't have it.

954
01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:25.820
- How come he's got your wand?
- Never mind why he's got my wand.

955
01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:29.330
What is that?

956
01:43:32.250 --> 01:43:33.290
You destroyed it.

957
01:43:36.580 --> 01:43:40.590
And how is it that you just happen
to have the sword of Gryffindor?

958
01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:42.920
It's a long story.

959
01:43:46.090 --> 01:43:50.220
- Don't think this changes anything.
- Oh, of course not.

960
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:53.640
I only just destroyed a bloody Horcrux.
Why would that change anything?

961
01:43:53.810 --> 01:43:57.900
Look, I wanted to come back
as soon as I left.

962
01:43:58.060 --> 01:44:01.480
- I just didn't know how to find you.
- Yeah, how did you find us?

963
01:44:01.650 --> 01:44:04.740
With this. It doesn't just turn off lights.

964
01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:09.780
I don't know how it works, but Christmas
morning I was sleeping in this little pub...

965
01:44:09.950 --> 01:44:12.410
...keeping away from some Snatchers...

966
01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:14.120
...and I heard it.

967
01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:15.960
It?

968
01:44:17.290 --> 01:44:19.210
A voice...

969
01:44:20.790 --> 01:44:22.000
...your voice, Hermione...

970
01:44:23.170 --> 01:44:24.800
...coming out of it.

971
01:44:24.970 --> 01:44:28.800
- And what exactly did I say, may I ask?
- My name.

972
01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:31.470
Just my name.

973
01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:34.310
Like a whisper.

974
01:44:36.310 --> 01:44:42.310
So I took it, clicked it,
and this tiny ball of light appeared.

975
01:44:42.770 --> 01:44:44.190
And I knew.

976
01:44:44.780 --> 01:44:49.410
And sure enough, it floated toward me,
the ball of light...

977
01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:55.330
...went right to my chest,
straight through me. Right here.

978
01:44:56.500 --> 01:45:00.500
And I knew it was gonna take me
where I needed to go, so I Disapparated...

979
01:45:00.670 --> 01:45:02.960
...and came to this hillside.

980
01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:06.010
It was dark. I had no idea where I was.

981
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:09.380
I just hoped
that one of you would show yourself.

982
01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:11.840
And you did.

983
01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:32.160
I've always liked these flames
Hermione makes.

984
01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:38.750
How long do you reckon
she'll stay mad at me?

985
01:45:40.290 --> 01:45:43.630
Well, just keep talking about that
little ball of light touching your heart...

986
01:45:43.790 --> 01:45:45.210
...and she'll come round.

987
01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:48.130
It was true. Every word.

988
01:45:49.930 --> 01:45:52.300
This is gonna sound crazy...

989
01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:57.140
...but I think that's why Dumbledore
left it to me, the Deluminator.

990
01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:02.650
I think he knew that somehow I'd need it
to find my way back, and she'd lead me.

991
01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:08.230
Bloody hell, I just realized,
you need a wand, don't you?

992
01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:10.900
- Yeah.
- I've got one here.

993
01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:13.780
It's a blackthorn. Ten inches.

994
01:46:13.950 --> 01:46:17.580
Nothing special, but I reckon it'll do.

995
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:20.790
Took if off a Snatcher
a couple of weeks ago.

996
01:46:21.290 --> 01:46:25.130
Don't tell Hermione this,
but they're a bit dim, Snatchers.

997
01:46:25.420 --> 01:46:28.340
This one was definitely part troll,
the smell of him.

998
01:46:28.510 --> 01:46:29.550
Engorgio.

999
01:46:29.710 --> 01:46:31.880
- Reducio!
- What's going on in there?

1000
01:46:32.050 --> 01:46:33.300
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

1001
01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:37.300
We need to talk.

1002
01:46:38.100 --> 01:46:39.310
Yeah, all right.

1003
01:46:46.270 --> 01:46:49.820
- I want to go see Xenophilius Lovegood.
- Sorry?

1004
01:46:51.610 --> 01:46:53.240
See this?

1005
01:46:53.410 --> 01:46:57.280
It's a letter Dumbledore wrote
to Grindelwald. Look at the signature.

1006
01:46:58.490 --> 01:47:00.700
It's the mark again.

1007
01:47:01.620 --> 01:47:03.790
It keeps cropping up.

1008
01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:08.290
In Beedle the Bard,
in the graveyard in Godric's Hollow.

1009
01:47:09.130 --> 01:47:11.010
It was there too.

1010
01:47:11.170 --> 01:47:14.800
- Where?
- Outside Gregorovitch's Wand Shop.

1011
01:47:15.220 --> 01:47:16.470
But what does it mean?

1012
01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:21.430
Look, you've got no idea where
the next Horcrux is, and neither do I...

1013
01:47:23.140 --> 01:47:26.060
...but this, this means something.

1014
01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:29.820
- I'm sure of it.
- Yeah. Hermione's right.

1015
01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:32.940
We ought to see Lovegood.

1016
01:47:33.450 --> 01:47:37.160
Let's vote on it. Those in favor?

1017
01:48:01.010 --> 01:48:03.640
You're not still mad at him, are you?

1018
01:48:03.930 --> 01:48:06.190
I'm always mad at him.

1019
01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:10.480
Luna.

1020
01:48:10.650 --> 01:48:12.360
Luna.

1021
01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:22.870
"Keep off the dirigible plums."

1022
01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:34.590
What is it? Who are you?

1023
01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:35.920
What do you want?

1024
01:48:36.090 --> 01:48:40.720
Hello, Mr. Lovegood. I'm Harry Potter.
We met a few months ago.

1025
01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:46.600
Could we come in?

1026
01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:52.980
- Where is Luna?
- Luna?

1027
01:48:54.230 --> 01:48:56.240
She'll be along.

1028
01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:11.790
So how can I help you, Mr. Potter?

1029
01:49:12.630 --> 01:49:15.670
Well, actually...

1030
01:49:16.670 --> 01:49:21.220
It was about something you were wearing
round your neck at the wedding. A symbol.

1031
01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:24.640
You mean this?

1032
01:49:25.060 --> 01:49:26.640
Yes.

1033
01:49:26.930 --> 01:49:28.810
That exactly.

1034
01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:33.440
What we've wondered is, what is it?

1035
01:49:33.610 --> 01:49:35.440
What is it?

1036
01:49:35.610 --> 01:49:38.610
Well, it's the sign of the Deathly Hallows,
of course.

1037
01:49:38.780 --> 01:49:39.860
- The what?
- The what?

1038
01:49:40.030 --> 01:49:42.110
The Deathly Hallows.

1039
01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:45.370
I assume you're all familiar with
"The Tale of the Three Brothers."

1040
01:49:45.540 --> 01:49:46.950
- Yes.
- No.

1041
01:49:52.380 --> 01:49:54.130
I have it in here.

1042
01:50:05.390 --> 01:50:07.010
"There were once three brothers...

1043
01:50:07.180 --> 01:50:11.600
...who were traveling along a lonely,
winding road at twilight."

1044
01:50:11.770 --> 01:50:14.480
Midnight. Mom always said "midnight."

1045
01:50:19.490 --> 01:50:23.360
But "twilight's" fine. Better, actually.

1046
01:50:25.660 --> 01:50:27.490
Do you want to read it?

1047
01:50:27.660 --> 01:50:29.870
No. It's fine.

1048
01:50:31.790 --> 01:50:33.710
"There were once three brothers..."

1049
01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:39.090
...who were traveling along a lonely,
winding road at twilight.

1050
01:50:40.970 --> 01:50:46.260
In time, the brothers reached a river
too treacherous to pass.

1051
01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:48.470
But being learned in the magical arts...

1052
01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:53.810
...the three brothers simply
waved their wands and made a bridge.

1053
01:50:55.150 --> 01:50:57.230
Before they could cross, however...

1054
01:50:57.400 --> 01:51:01.530
...they found their path blocked
by a hooded figure.

1055
01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:05.660
It was Death, and he felt cheated.

1056
01:51:05.820 --> 01:51:08.870
Cheated because travelers would
normally drown in the river.

1057
01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:11.120
But Death was cunning.

1058
01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:14.750
He pretended to congratulate
the three brothers on their magic...

1059
01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:20.210
...and said that each had earned a prize for
having been clever enough to evade him.

1060
01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:25.340
The oldest asked for a wand
more powerful than any in existence.

1061
01:51:25.510 --> 01:51:30.100
So Death fashioned him one
from an elder tree that stood nearby.

1062
01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:35.810
The second brother decided he wanted
to humiliate Death even further...

1063
01:51:35.980 --> 01:51:40.400
...and asked for the power
to recall loved ones from the grave.

1064
01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:45.150
So Death plucked a stone from the river
and offered it to him.

1065
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:49.870
Finally,
Death turned to the third brother.

1066
01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:52.490
A humble man...

1067
01:51:52.660 --> 01:51:56.870
...he asked for something that would
allow him to go forth from that place...

1068
01:51:57.040 --> 01:52:00.210
...without being followed by Death.

1069
01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:07.180
And so it was that Death reluctantly
handed over his own Cloak of invisibility.

1070
01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:13.470
The first brother traveled
to a distant village...

1071
01:52:13.640 --> 01:52:15.770
...where, with the Elder Wand in hand...

1072
01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:19.690
...he killed a wizard
with whom he had once quarreled.

1073
01:52:21.900 --> 01:52:25.440
Drunk with the power
that the Elder Wand had given him...

1074
01:52:25.610 --> 01:52:28.700
...he bragged of his invincibility.

1075
01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:35.160
But that night,
another wizard stole the wand...

1076
01:52:35.330 --> 01:52:38.460
...and slit the brother's throat
for good measure.

1077
01:52:38.670 --> 01:52:42.130
And so Death took the first brother
for his own.

1078
01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:44.800
The second brother journeyed
to his home...

1079
01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:47.970
...where he took the stone
and turned it thrice in hand.

1080
01:52:48.130 --> 01:52:52.600
To his delight, the girl he'd once hoped
to marry before her untimely death...

1081
01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:55.140
...appeared before him.

1082
01:52:55.640 --> 01:53:00.940
Yet, soon she turned sad and cold
for she did not belong in the mortal world.

1083
01:53:01.110 --> 01:53:02.730
Driven mad with hopeless longing...

1084
01:53:02.900 --> 01:53:06.190
...the second brother killed himself
so as to join her.

1085
01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:10.490
And so Death took the second brother.

1086
01:53:10.660 --> 01:53:12.320
As for the third brother...

1087
01:53:12.490 --> 01:53:16.700
...Death searched for many years
but was never able to find him.

1088
01:53:16.870 --> 01:53:19.790
Only when he attained a great age
did the youngest brother...

1089
01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:24.210
...shed the Cloak of invisibility
and give it to his son.

1090
01:53:25.460 --> 01:53:29.590
He then greeted Death as an old friend
and went with him gladly...

1091
01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:32.930
"...departing this life as equals."

1092
01:53:35.010 --> 01:53:39.520
- So there you are.
- Those are the Deathly Hallows.

1093
01:53:40.900 --> 01:53:43.980
I'm sorry, sir.
I still don't quite understand.

1094
01:53:49.570 --> 01:53:51.700
Where's that pen I had?

1095
01:54:02.670 --> 01:54:03.920
The Elder Wand.

1096
01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:08.710
The most powerful wand ever made.

1097
01:54:19.100 --> 01:54:21.390
The Resurrection Stone.

1098
01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:36.070
The Cloak of invisibility.

1099
01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:41.250
Together, they make the Deathly Hallows.

1100
01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:46.960
Together, they make one
master of Death.

1101
01:54:52.180 --> 01:54:55.840
That mark was on a grave
in Godric's Hollow.

1102
01:54:56.930 --> 01:54:59.600
Uh, Mr. Lovegood,
does the Peverell Family...

1103
01:54:59.770 --> 01:55:01.600
...have anything to do
with the Deathly Hallows?

1104
01:55:01.770 --> 01:55:04.600
Uh... Uh...

1105
01:55:04.770 --> 01:55:08.520
Ignotus... Excuse me... and his brothers,
Cadmus and Antioch...

1106
01:55:08.690 --> 01:55:11.360
...are thought to be the original owners
of the Hallows...

1107
01:55:11.530 --> 01:55:16.410
...and therefore the inspiration
for the story. Uh... Uh...

1108
01:55:16.570 --> 01:55:19.080
But your tea's gone cold.

1109
01:55:20.290 --> 01:55:22.290
I'll be right back.

1110
01:55:22.460 --> 01:55:24.290
Let's go down here.

1111
01:55:26.170 --> 01:55:27.670
Let's get out of here.

1112
01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:30.710
I'm not drinking any more of that stuff,
hot or cold.

1113
01:55:37.010 --> 01:55:38.970
Thank you, sir.

1114
01:55:39.890 --> 01:55:42.930
- You forgot the water.
- Water?

1115
01:55:43.100 --> 01:55:44.520
For the tea.

1116
01:55:44.690 --> 01:55:47.270
Did...? Did I?

1117
01:55:49.190 --> 01:55:51.360
How silly of me.

1118
01:55:52.990 --> 01:55:55.240
It's no matter.
We really should be going anyway.

1119
01:55:55.400 --> 01:55:57.490
No, you can't!

1120
01:56:01.660 --> 01:56:03.370
Sir?

1121
01:56:10.750 --> 01:56:13.340
You're my only hope.

1122
01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:21.600
They were angry, you see,
about what I'd been writing.

1123
01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:26.770
So they took her.

1124
01:56:28.230 --> 01:56:31.020
They took my Luna.

1125
01:56:32.690 --> 01:56:34.360
My Luna.

1126
01:56:46.830 --> 01:56:49.710
But it's really you they want.

1127
01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:54.050
Who took her, sir?

1128
01:56:59.180 --> 01:57:00.430
Voldemort.

1129
01:57:11.060 --> 01:57:13.400
Stop! I've got him!

1130
01:57:30.670 --> 01:57:34.590
That treacherous little bleeder.
Is there no one we can trust?

1131
01:57:34.750 --> 01:57:37.050
They kidnapped her
because he supported me.

1132
01:57:37.210 --> 01:57:39.340
He was just desperate.

1133
01:57:39.880 --> 01:57:42.090
I'll do the enchantments.

1134
01:57:53.770 --> 01:57:55.190
Hello, beautiful.

1135
01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:04.280
Well, don't hang about, snatch them.

1136
01:59:15.520 --> 01:59:17.020
Harry.

1137
01:59:17.190 --> 01:59:20.190
Tell me, Grindelwald.
Tell me where it is.

1138
01:59:20.780 --> 01:59:24.860
Grindelwald. Grindelwald. Grindelwald.

1139
01:59:25.570 --> 01:59:29.030
Hello, Tom.
I knew you would come one day...

1140
01:59:29.540 --> 01:59:33.500
...but surely you must know
I no longer have what you seek.

1141
01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:37.170
- Tell me, Grindelwald. Tell me where it is.
- Ha-ha-ha.

1142
01:59:37.330 --> 01:59:38.710
Tell me who possesses it.

1143
01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:44.010
The Elder Wand lies with him,
of course...

1144
01:59:44.180 --> 01:59:46.430
...buried in the earth.

1145
01:59:47.390 --> 01:59:48.720
Dumbledore.

1146
01:59:57.730 --> 01:59:59.610
The Hallows exist...

1147
01:59:59.770 --> 02:00:03.570
...but he's only after one of them,
the last one. He knows where it is.

1148
02:00:03.740 --> 02:00:07.570
He's gonna have it by the end of the night.
You-Know-Who's found the Elder Wand.

1149
02:00:07.740 --> 02:00:10.240
- Don't touch her. Unh!
- Leave him.

1150
02:00:10.410 --> 02:00:11.660
Your boyfriend will get worse than that...

1151
02:00:11.830 --> 02:00:12.950
Get off me.

1152
02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:15.870
...If he doesn't learn to behave himself.

1153
02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:20.590
What happened to you, ugly?

1154
02:00:22.300 --> 02:00:24.170
No, not you.

1155
02:00:25.590 --> 02:00:28.640
- What's your name?
- Dudley. Vernon Dudley.

1156
02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:31.010
Check it.

1157
02:00:32.600 --> 02:00:34.930
And you, my lovely...

1158
02:00:38.270 --> 02:00:40.270
...what do they call you?

1159
02:00:41.690 --> 02:00:45.780
Penelope Clearwater, half-blood.

1160
02:00:48.860 --> 02:00:50.780
There's no Vernon Dudley on here.

1161
02:00:51.870 --> 02:00:55.120
- Did you hear that, ugly?
- The list says you're lying.

1162
02:00:55.290 --> 02:00:57.500
How come you don't want us
to know who you are?

1163
02:00:57.670 --> 02:01:00.330
The list's wrong. I told you who I am.

1164
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:18.390
Change of plan.

1165
02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:22.730
We're not taking this lot to the Ministry.

1166
02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:06.020
Get Draco.

1167
02:02:10.530 --> 02:02:12.070
Well?

1168
02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:19.700
- I can't be sure.
- Draco. Look closely, son.

1169
02:02:20.710 --> 02:02:25.790
If we are the ones
to hand Potter over to the Dark Lord...

1170
02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:31.220
...everything would be forgiven.
All would be as it was, you understand?

1171
02:02:31.380 --> 02:02:35.510
Now, we won't be forgetting who
actually caught him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy.

1172
02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:38.100
You dare to
talk to me like that in my own house?

1173
02:02:38.270 --> 02:02:40.060
Lucius.

1174
02:02:42.980 --> 02:02:46.810
Don't be shy, sweetie. Come over.

1175
02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:53.070
Now, if this isn't who we think it is,
Draco, and we call him, he'll kill us all.

1176
02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:56.070
We need to be absolutely sure.

1177
02:02:56.370 --> 02:02:57.370
What's wrong with his face?

1178
02:02:57.530 --> 02:02:59.240
Yes, what is wrong with his face?

1179
02:02:59.410 --> 02:03:01.080
He came to us like that.

1180
02:03:01.330 --> 02:03:02.750
Something he picked up in the forest,
I reckon.

1181
02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:06.630
Or ran into a Stinging Jinx.
Was it you, dearie?

1182
02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:14.510
Give me her wand.
We'll see what her last spell was.

1183
02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:17.260
Ah.

1184
02:03:17.550 --> 02:03:18.600
Got you.

1185
02:03:21.770 --> 02:03:23.480
What is that?

1186
02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:27.020
Where'd you get that from?

1187
02:03:27.190 --> 02:03:30.690
It was in her bag when we searched her.
Reckon it's mine now.

1188
02:03:34.450 --> 02:03:35.780
Are you mad?

1189
02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:46.920
Go! Get out!

1190
02:03:52.630 --> 02:03:56.720
Cissy, put the boys in the cellar.

1191
02:03:56.890 --> 02:04:02.270
I want to have a little conversation
with this one, girl-to-girl.

1192
02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:14.400
What are we gonna do?
We can't leave Hermione alone with her.

1193
02:04:14.570 --> 02:04:15.950
Ron?

1194
02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:22.700
Harry?

1195
02:04:28.420 --> 02:04:30.000
Luna?

1196
02:04:30.590 --> 02:04:34.760
That sword is meant to be in my vault
at Gringotts. How did you get it?

1197
02:04:34.920 --> 02:04:38.050
What else did you and your friends take
from my vault?!

1198
02:04:38.220 --> 02:04:43.600
- I didn't take anything. Please.
- I didn't take anything.

1199
02:04:43.770 --> 02:04:45.310
I don't believe it.

1200
02:04:50.860 --> 02:04:51.980
We have to do something.

1201
02:04:52.150 --> 02:04:56.190
There's no way out of here.
We've tried everything. It's enchanted.

1202
02:04:56.360 --> 02:04:59.030
- Please! please!
- Shut up!

1203
02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:01.030
You're bleeding, Harry.

1204
02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:03.200
That's a curious thing
to keep in your sock.

1205
02:05:12.460 --> 02:05:13.590
Help us.

1206
02:05:19.380 --> 02:05:21.260
- Let her go.
- Shut up. Get back.

1207
02:05:22.600 --> 02:05:26.810
You, goblin, come with me.

1208
02:05:46.450 --> 02:05:47.950
- Aah!
- Dobby?

1209
02:05:48.830 --> 02:05:50.250
What are you doing here?

1210
02:05:50.420 --> 02:05:52.670
Dobby has come to rescue
Harry Potter, of course.

1211
02:05:52.840 --> 02:05:55.290
Dobby will always be there
for Harry Potter.

1212
02:05:55.460 --> 02:05:59.090
You can Apparate in and out of this room?
Could you take us with you?

1213
02:05:59.260 --> 02:06:01.010
Of course, sir. I'm an elf.

1214
02:06:01.800 --> 02:06:03.680
Works for me.

1215
02:06:03.930 --> 02:06:06.260
Dobby, I want you to take Luna
and Mr. Ollivander...

1216
02:06:06.430 --> 02:06:08.890
Shell Cottage
on the outskirts of Tinworth.

1217
02:06:09.270 --> 02:06:10.270
Trust me.

1218
02:06:11.100 --> 02:06:12.520
Whenever you're ready, sir.

1219
02:06:13.230 --> 02:06:15.940
Sir? I like her very much.

1220
02:06:20.860 --> 02:06:24.160
Meet me at the top of the stairs
in 10 seconds.

1221
02:06:33.250 --> 02:06:35.000
Ow.

1222
02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:42.630
Who gets his wand?

1223
02:06:45.390 --> 02:06:49.390
I'm only going to
ask you once more, goblin.

1224
02:06:49.560 --> 02:06:52.980
Think very, very carefully
before you answer.

1225
02:06:53.310 --> 02:06:54.900
I don't know.

1226
02:06:55.060 --> 02:06:58.270
You don't know?
Why weren't you doing your job?

1227
02:06:58.440 --> 02:07:01.650
Who got into my vault?

1228
02:07:02.950 --> 02:07:07.370
Who stole it? Who stole it? Well?

1229
02:07:07.530 --> 02:07:11.580
When I was last in your vault,
the sword was there.

1230
02:07:14.330 --> 02:07:17.540
Oh, well, then perhaps
it just walked out on its own then.

1231
02:07:17.710 --> 02:07:20.170
There is no place safer than Gringotts.

1232
02:07:20.340 --> 02:07:21.710
Liar!

1233
02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:27.090
Consider yourself lucky, goblin.

1234
02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:32.930
The same won't be said for this one.

1235
02:07:33.100 --> 02:07:34.850
Like hell.

1236
02:07:35.600 --> 02:07:36.850
Expelliarmus!

1237
02:07:38.270 --> 02:07:39.360
Stupefy.

1238
02:07:43.530 --> 02:07:44.860
Stop!

1239
02:07:46.030 --> 02:07:47.620
Drop your wands.

1240
02:07:50.490 --> 02:07:51.540
I said, drop them!

1241
02:07:53.040 --> 02:07:54.460
Pick them up, Draco, now.

1242
02:07:55.330 --> 02:07:56.500
Well, well, well...

1243
02:07:57.250 --> 02:07:59.460
...look what we have here.

1244
02:08:01.050 --> 02:08:02.550
It's Harry Potter.

1245
02:08:03.340 --> 02:08:09.720
He's all bright and shiny and new again,
just in time for the Dark Lord.

1246
02:08:09.890 --> 02:08:11.890
Call him.

1247
02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:54.470
Stupefy!

1248
02:08:55.270 --> 02:08:56.930
Stupid elf.

1249
02:08:57.100 --> 02:09:00.150
- You could've killed me.
- Dobby never meant to kill.

1250
02:09:00.310 --> 02:09:04.360
Dobby only meant to maim
or seriously injure.

1251
02:09:06.650 --> 02:09:09.990
How dare you take a witch's wand?

1252
02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:13.160
How dare you defy your masters?

1253
02:09:13.330 --> 02:09:16.450
Dobby has no master.

1254
02:09:16.620 --> 02:09:19.120
Dobby is a free elf.

1255
02:09:19.290 --> 02:09:24.250
And Dobby has come
to save Harry Potter and his friends.

1256
02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:55.790
Hermione.

1257
02:09:55.950 --> 02:09:58.450
You're all right. We're safe.

1258
02:09:58.620 --> 02:10:00.660
We're all safe.

1259
02:10:01.500 --> 02:10:03.710
Harry Potter.

1260
02:10:07.460 --> 02:10:09.300
Dobby.

1261
02:10:19.810 --> 02:10:22.850
Dobby. No, just... Hold on.

1262
02:10:23.020 --> 02:10:27.360
Hold on. Look, just hold on, okay?

1263
02:10:27.530 --> 02:10:29.610
We'll fix you.

1264
02:10:30.030 --> 02:10:32.780
Hermione will have something.

1265
02:10:32.950 --> 02:10:35.280
In your bag. Hermione?

1266
02:10:36.910 --> 02:10:38.240
Hermione?

1267
02:10:40.460 --> 02:10:43.580
What is it? Help me.

1268
02:10:46.170 --> 02:10:49.300
Such a beautiful place...

1269
02:10:51.470 --> 02:10:53.720
...to be with friends.

1270
02:10:55.550 --> 02:11:00.930
Dobby is happy to be with his friend...

1271
02:11:03.350 --> 02:11:05.770
...Harry Potter.

1272
02:11:26.590 --> 02:11:28.960
We should close his eyes.

1273
02:11:29.210 --> 02:11:31.260
Don't you think?

1274
02:11:36.340 --> 02:11:37.760
There.

1275
02:11:38.220 --> 02:11:40.640
Now he could be sleeping.

1276
02:11:55.950 --> 02:11:58.030
I want to bury him.

1277
02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:02.620
Properly. Without magic.
