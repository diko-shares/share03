00:57:35.535 --> 00:57:37.871
You haven't forgotten me, have you?

717
00:57:40.499 --> 00:57:41.500
Hmm.

718
00:57:43.543 --> 00:57:45.045
Who's Billy?

719
00:57:47.005 --> 00:57:48.674
Just a fellow.

720
00:57:50.842 --> 00:57:53.512
Must be quite a few
fellows in your life.

721
00:57:55.097 --> 00:57:56.390
Billy,

722
00:57:57.307 --> 00:57:58.558
me,

723
00:57:59.393 --> 00:58:00.727
the colonel.

724
00:58:01.687 --> 00:58:03.355
Did you marry all of them? Eh?

725
00:58:03.563 --> 00:58:04.731
No, just you.

726
00:58:04.898 --> 00:58:06.233
Oh, liar.

727
00:58:07.526 --> 00:58:08.902
Liar.

728
00:58:13.407 --> 00:58:14.741
[whispers] Liar.

729
00:58:22.541 --> 00:58:24.376
Well, what is it, then?

730
00:58:24.543 --> 00:58:26.878
- What is it?
- Yes.

731
00:58:27.045 --> 00:58:28.588
What are your plans for me?

732
00:58:29.256 --> 00:58:31.717
- My plans?
- Hmm.

733
00:58:32.175 --> 00:58:34.511
I just came hereto kill you.

734
00:58:35.595 --> 00:58:38.098
[laughs]

735
00:58:42.936 --> 00:58:44.438
My God.

736
00:58:47.941 --> 00:58:49.943
All right, do it.

737
00:58:56.158 --> 00:58:57.159
Oh.

738
00:58:58.118 --> 00:59:00.454
There. There's my heart. Don't hesitate.

739
00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:03.331
Your money's gone. Do it.

740
00:59:03.498 --> 00:59:04.666
Gone.

741
00:59:05.876 --> 00:59:07.627
Like the woman you murdered?

742
00:59:09.963 --> 00:59:12.090
- What? No.
- Yes.

743
00:59:12.257 --> 00:59:14.551
- You were with her on that boat!
- Believe what you want!

744
00:59:14.718 --> 00:59:17.804
- But not that!
- You were seen together!

745
00:59:19.681 --> 00:59:21.141
I was not alone.

746
00:59:21.308 --> 00:59:22.934
She told you all about me, didn't she?

747
00:59:23.101 --> 00:59:24.603
No!

748
00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:26.646
I told him!

749
00:59:26.813 --> 00:59:29.941
The next day,
he told me she'd had an accident

750
00:59:30.108 --> 00:59:31.943
and to take her place. So I did.

751
00:59:33.153 --> 00:59:34.863
Another man? Eh?

752
00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:36.281
Accomplice?

753
00:59:36.448 --> 00:59:38.492
Friend? Lover?

754
00:59:38.658 --> 00:59:39.659
An accomplice--

755
00:59:41.244 --> 00:59:44.748
You saw us together,
backstage, at the play.

756
00:59:45.832 --> 00:59:48.210
My friend, my accomplice and,

757
00:59:48.376 --> 00:59:51.338
Yes, yes, my lover.

758
00:59:51.505 --> 00:59:54.549
He was an actor, like myself.
Actors playing parts.

759
00:59:56.093 --> 00:59:58.678
I told him that night,
I didn't want to go through with it.

760
00:59:58.845 --> 01:00:00.764
I couldn't go through with it--

761
01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:02.349
Why not? Why not?

762
01:00:02.516 --> 01:00:03.767
Because!

763
01:00:04.351 --> 01:00:06.269
Because I was...

764
01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:08.980
Damn it. I was falling
in love with my own husband.

765
01:00:09.147 --> 01:00:10.816
Again. Liar.

766
01:00:13.735 --> 01:00:15.862
I could have--I could
have bought him off!

767
01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:17.739
I could have kept him away!

768
01:00:17.906 --> 01:00:20.742
But you made me write to her sister
and then it was all over!

769
01:00:20.909 --> 01:00:21.910
Whore!

770
01:00:22.369 --> 01:00:23.370
Thief!

771
01:00:23.537 --> 01:00:24.871
[cocks gun]

772
01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:28.041
This is howl live.
It's all I know.

773
01:00:28.208 --> 01:00:31.378
I took the money
and I gave it to him.

774
01:00:32.712 --> 01:00:35.674
Oh! And then I ran.

775
01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:37.551
No!

776
01:00:41.388 --> 01:00:43.056
What does it matter?

777
01:00:43.265 --> 01:00:44.808
What does it matter?

778
01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:46.268
It's over.

779
01:00:47.102 --> 01:00:48.103
God!

780
01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:50.188
Whore!

781
01:00:50.355 --> 01:00:51.773
Liar! Thief!

782
01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:53.233
Yes! Yes!

783
01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.819
Don't you see?
Don't you see?

784
01:00:56.444 --> 01:00:59.030
Don't you see I cannot
breathe without you?

785
01:00:59.197 --> 01:01:00.782
I cannot live without you!

786
01:01:00.949 --> 01:01:03.743
Don't you see that?
Don't you see how much I love you?

787
01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:07.289
[sobs]

788
01:01:10.292 --> 01:01:12.544
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

789
01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:32.772
[church bell tolls]

790
01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:50.248
[Luis whispers] Where am I?

791
01:01:54.252 --> 01:01:55.587
Who are you?

792
01:01:59.633 --> 01:02:00.800
Really.

793
01:02:01.343 --> 01:02:03.386
My name's Bonny.

794
01:02:04.679 --> 01:02:06.181
Bonny Castle.

795
01:02:08.308 --> 01:02:09.809
[whispers] Bonny Castle.

796
01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:16.024
Is that your Christian name?

797
01:02:16.524 --> 01:02:17.943
It would be

798
01:02:18.652 --> 01:02:20.278
if I were Christian.

799
01:02:21.071 --> 01:02:22.572
But I'm not.

800
01:02:24.324 --> 01:02:26.076
I was never baptized.

801
01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:28.620
I was a foundling.

802
01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:32.666
And so was Billy.

803
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:46.513
We were raised in an orphanage
outside of St. Louis.

804
01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:49.975
He gave me my name.

805
01:02:50.976 --> 01:02:53.895
He saw it on a picture
postcard from Scotland.

806
01:02:54.354 --> 01:02:58.984
It had a drawing on it,
of a "bonny castle," it said.

807
01:03:00.527 --> 01:03:03.738
When we were 14,
we ran away together.

808
01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:09.327
Like brother, sister, father,
daughter, husband, wife.

809
01:03:09.494 --> 01:03:11.371
- And he was my salvation.
- No!

810
01:03:12.872 --> 01:03:13.873
No.

811
01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:17.919
I don't want to know.

812
01:03:19.838 --> 01:03:21.006
Not now.

813
01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:27.637
You are Julia Russell,
from Wilmington, Delaware.

814
01:03:29.723 --> 01:03:31.599
You were born

815
01:03:31.766 --> 01:03:34.019
the day you stepped off that boat

816
01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:36.980
and became my wife.

817
01:03:41.693 --> 01:03:43.111
But then,

818
01:03:43.278 --> 01:03:45.947
then I am not Julia Russell
at all, am I?

819
01:03:49.034 --> 01:03:50.452
I'm simply your wife.

820
01:04:38.792 --> 01:04:40.210
[knock on door]

821
01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:41.378
Mmm.

822
01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:45.840
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

823
01:04:46.007 --> 01:04:48.176
It's Edwin, my dear.

824
01:04:48.635 --> 01:04:50.637
Am I too early?

825
01:04:51.471 --> 01:04:53.139
Don't hurry.

826
01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:58.478
Nothing gives me more pleasure than
to wait for you outside your door.

827
01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:03.024
Unless, of course,
you were to let me in.

828
01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.999
- Col. Worth.
- Good God!

829
01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:22.669
- May I help you, sir?
- You are not dressed, sir.

830
01:05:22.836 --> 01:05:25.338
Eh, eh, no, I am not.

831
01:05:25.505 --> 01:05:28.174
Uh, I am engaged at the moment
in a private function.

832
01:05:28.341 --> 01:05:31.886
A function for which clothes
are more of a hindrance than a help.

833
01:05:32.053 --> 01:05:34.472
- A private function?
- Yes, sir.

834
01:05:34.681 --> 01:05:37.225
With Bonny? A private function?

835
01:05:37.392 --> 01:05:38.977
Good God, man!

836
01:05:39.144 --> 01:05:42.564
But--but I am being rude.
Please--please, come in.

837
01:05:43.398 --> 01:05:46.693
- No, sir. Are you mad?
- Mad? No.

838
01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:52.073
I am only curious to know what exactly
is your business at my wife's door.

839
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:57.370
Your wife?

840
01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:00.123
Did you say "wife"?

841
01:06:00.665 --> 01:06:02.667
Edwin. Edwin, be careful.

842
01:06:02.834 --> 01:06:04.794
He has a fearful temper.

843
01:06:06.379 --> 01:06:08.423
I beg your pardon, sir. I do.

844
01:06:09.257 --> 01:06:10.925
I beg your pardon.

845
01:06:11.426 --> 01:06:13.261
I'm an old fool.

846
01:06:13.761 --> 01:06:15.430
I didn't know.

847
01:06:17.891 --> 01:06:18.933
I'm sorry.

848
01:06:22.437 --> 01:06:23.438
Well...

849
01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:27.942
Good morning to you, sir.

850
01:06:28.943 --> 01:06:29.944
Good morning.

851
01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:31.529
Good morning.

852
01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:32.780
Good morning.

853
01:06:32.947 --> 01:06:33.948
[whispers] Good morning.

854
01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:39.579
You see?

855
01:06:41.372 --> 01:06:43.041
You have no past.

856
01:06:43.208 --> 01:06:44.125
Mmm.

857
01:06:44.292 --> 01:06:46.628
It's gone. Finished.

858
01:06:47.295 --> 01:06:48.963
Disappeared.

859
01:06:51.466 --> 01:06:53.343
You have only me now.

860
01:06:59.599 --> 01:07:01.809
[peacocks cawing]

861
01:07:13.112 --> 01:07:14.113
'Morning.

862
01:07:14.322 --> 01:07:16.908
There you are. You weren't
in your room this morning.

863
01:07:17.659 --> 01:07:19.994
I have some very interesting news.

864
01:07:20.161 --> 01:07:21.663
So do I.

865
01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:29.003
[reads in Spanish]

866
01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:30.838
"Woman's body found."

867
01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:33.633
"Foul play suspected."
How's my Spanish?

868
01:07:36.844 --> 01:07:38.346
Julia Russell?

869
01:07:39.806 --> 01:07:43.142
Stabbed in the neck with a small knife,
then thrown overboard.

870
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:46.646
Probably the work of a man,
but could've easily been a woman.

871
01:07:46.854 --> 01:07:49.816
The blade of the knife
was still in her throat.

872
01:07:51.859 --> 01:07:54.028
And so your wife

873
01:07:54.612 --> 01:07:56.906
is now officially a fugitive.

874
01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:59.867
Not only are we pursuing her,
but the police, as well.

875
01:08:01.244 --> 01:08:03.162
Cheer up, man.
This is good news.

876
01:08:03.329 --> 01:08:05.498
It won't be long now
before she's caught.

877
01:08:06.541 --> 01:08:07.542
She...

878
01:08:08.209 --> 01:08:09.877
didn't do this.

879
01:08:13.715 --> 01:08:15.883
I believe you still
love her, don't you?

880
01:08:20.096 --> 01:08:22.974
Of course. How could
you hate her so much

881
01:08:23.141 --> 01:08:25.727
if you did not still love her?

882
01:08:27.812 --> 01:08:31.316
<i>Trust me, my friend.
There is no such thing as love.</i>

883
01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:33.901
<i>There are only misguided
feelings and emotions.</i>

884
01:08:34.235 --> 01:08:36.863
It was my knife. He used my knife.

885
01:08:37.030 --> 01:08:39.532
- Yes, yes.
- It wasn't me, I promise you.

886
01:08:39.699 --> 01:08:41.326
I believe you.

887
01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:43.995
No one else will,
no one will believe that I'm innocent.

888
01:08:44.162 --> 01:08:45.413
Listen to me.

889
01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:48.041
No one else matters. Not to me.

890
01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:01.804
What are you thinking?

891
01:09:03.056 --> 01:09:04.057
Of you.

892
01:09:12.190 --> 01:09:14.192
[man] Welcome to Cardenas.

893
01:09:14.692 --> 01:09:18.613
Right this way. This is the entrance.
It's very elegant,

894
01:09:19.238 --> 01:09:21.407
in a very good part of town.

895
01:09:21.824 --> 01:09:25.411
Mostly Americans
and tourists from the continent.

896
01:09:26.371 --> 01:09:30.541
<i>I think you'll find all
the furnishings you need included.</i>

897
01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:32.460
<i>A bedroom,</i>

898
01:09:32.627 --> 01:09:35.338
<i>a sitting room,
a very good kitchen.</i>

899
01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.758
[Julia laughs]

900
01:09:38.925 --> 01:09:42.095
<i>Here in Cardenas,
you are close to Havana,</i>

901
01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:44.430
<i>but very far away.</i>

902
01:09:45.098 --> 01:09:49.936
We are known for the waters
and for the healing powers of the sun.

903
01:10:25.304 --> 01:10:26.514
Vargas.

904
01:10:28.141 --> 01:10:29.559
What a happy accident.

905
01:10:29.726 --> 01:10:31.269
Yes. Yes, indeed.

906
01:10:31.436 --> 01:10:32.437
Ha.

907
01:10:33.479 --> 01:10:35.481
What--what brings you to Cardenas?

908
01:10:35.732 --> 01:10:37.900
Not a rest cure, I assure you.

909
01:10:38.735 --> 01:10:40.737
No, of course not.

910
01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:44.615
There were reports of a woman
answering a certain description.

911
01:10:44.782 --> 01:10:46.993
She was seen boarding a train,
heading east.

912
01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:50.538
You haven't seen
or heard anything, have you?

913
01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:54.333
I have lost my taste
for women of that description.

914
01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.669
Ah. Glad to hear of it.

915
01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:01.299
Uh, listen, uh...

916
01:11:02.592 --> 01:11:04.260
Can I offer you a pinales?

917
01:11:04.469 --> 01:11:07.138
- What's that?
- A drink.

918
01:11:07.305 --> 01:11:09.223
- Huh.
- A drink.

919
01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:11.434
Uh, there is a cafe down the street.

920
01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:18.441
The sun is warm. [sighs]

921
01:11:18.608 --> 01:11:21.360
Your face, for instance,
is quite moist.

922
01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:34.624
The body was positively
identified by her sister.

923
01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:37.794
Very sad. But very accurate.

924
01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:41.255
2 moles high on the inner thigh,

925
01:11:42.089 --> 01:11:43.925
and a gold crown on a back tooth.

926
01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:48.805
And on her left hand,
a small, round scar.

927
01:11:49.639 --> 01:11:51.140
That's very interesting.

928
01:11:53.392 --> 01:11:56.312
Will you excuse me?
I have to use the convenience.

929
01:11:56.562 --> 01:11:58.231
By all means.

930
01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:01.984
Do as you must.

931
01:12:13.538 --> 01:12:14.956
[horse neighs]

932
01:12:31.264 --> 01:12:32.431
[door opens]

933
01:12:34.851 --> 01:12:36.185
Julia?

934
01:12:36.477 --> 01:12:37.478
[door closes]

935
01:12:37.895 --> 01:12:38.896
Julia!

936
01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:41.858
Come upstairs. We...

937
01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:45.194
Ah, Luis.

938
01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:48.030
I am disappointed.

939
01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:53.703
And yet full of admiration.

940
01:12:57.748 --> 01:12:59.000
Where is she?

941
01:12:59.166 --> 01:13:01.460
Who? No. She's not here.

942
01:13:01.627 --> 01:13:02.545
You called her name.

943
01:13:02.712 --> 01:13:04.547
Wait, wait. You have no business here.

944
01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:08.384
Downs, please. Be smart and leave.
Get out while you still can.

945
01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:09.677
She's mine, Luis.

946
01:13:09.844 --> 01:13:11.596
Give her up, before it's too late.

947
01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:14.891
You are aiding a criminal!

948
01:13:15.474 --> 01:13:18.686
And you are very close
to becoming a criminal yourself.

949
01:13:18.853 --> 01:13:20.563
Come to your senses, man.

950
01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:24.233
You saw it. She is not here.
Now, please. Please.

951
01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.777
Don't lie to me, Mr. Vargas.

952
01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:29.155
I can smell her on you.

953
01:13:29.363 --> 01:13:32.867
Her perfume,
stinking on your clothing.

954
01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:35.161
You just left her, didn't you?

955
01:13:35.328 --> 01:13:37.330
But that's it. Get out. Get out now.

956
01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:39.415
[groans]

957
01:13:39.582 --> 01:13:41.083
Did she throw her arms around you?

958
01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:42.752
Embrace you, like this?

959
01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:46.255
Did she rub her cheek
against yours, like this?

960
01:13:46.589 --> 01:13:48.799
Did she kiss you on the mouth?

961
01:13:48.966 --> 01:13:51.844
If I kiss you now,
will I taste her on you?

962
01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:57.183
[gunshot]

963
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:58.225
Go!

964
01:13:58.392 --> 01:13:59.852
[coughs]

965
01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:04.106
Oh.

966
01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:08.361
You would do this for her?

967
01:14:08.527 --> 01:14:11.948
- Lu?
- Wait! Wait.

968
01:14:12.114 --> 01:14:13.199
Wait.

969
01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:17.453
Speak of the devil,
and she appears.

970
01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:19.205
Oh, no, no, no!

971
01:14:25.544 --> 01:14:27.630
My God. What have you done?

972
01:14:27.964 --> 01:14:29.090
What have you done?

973
01:14:29.256 --> 01:14:31.217
It's--it's--it's him.

974
01:14:32.093 --> 01:14:34.220
It's the detective.

975
01:14:34.387 --> 01:14:35.304
[sobs]

976
01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:37.139
He came here for you.

977
01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:48.025
What are you doing?
Don't touch him.

978
01:14:48.192 --> 01:14:49.902
Don't touch him!

979
01:14:55.783 --> 01:14:56.784
[sighs]

980
01:14:57.535 --> 01:14:59.078
Did he come here alone?

981
01:14:59.245 --> 01:15:00.413
Yes.

982
01:15:00.579 --> 01:15:01.998
No one saw him come in?

983
01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:04.250
I-I-I...

984
01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:05.918
I don't know.

985
01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:08.254
Christ, Julia.

986
01:15:09.088 --> 01:15:10.506
I've killed a man.

987
01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:13.342
You need to go now.
Go to the train station.

988
01:15:13.592 --> 01:15:17.096
Secure 2 seats on the
morning train east, no matter where.

989
01:15:18.014 --> 01:15:18.931
And...

990
01:15:19.098 --> 01:15:22.768
I will contact the estate agent and
tell him that we've changed our minds,

991
01:15:22.935 --> 01:15:25.354
and there's been an emergency.

992
01:15:27.273 --> 01:15:28.607
Julia.

993
01:15:30.443 --> 01:15:31.944
Yes, what?

994
01:15:33.612 --> 01:15:35.448
I've just killed a man.

995
01:15:37.116 --> 01:15:39.285
And I just bought a hat.

996
01:15:42.788 --> 01:15:43.789
But I don't dwell on it.

997
01:15:43.956 --> 01:15:46.792
I don't go around saying
over and over in my head,

998
01:15:46.959 --> 01:15:50.337
"I just bought a hat." "I just
bought a hat." It doesn't matter.

999
01:15:50.504 --> 01:15:51.505
It doesn't matter.

1000
01:15:52.631 --> 01:15:54.842
It's done. Help me.

1001
01:15:56.761 --> 01:15:57.928
Oh, God.

1002
01:16:09.648 --> 01:16:11.984
- There. That should do it.
- I'll bring him down.

1003
01:16:12.151 --> 01:16:15.821
No. No. You need to go to the station
before the window closes.

1004
01:16:17.031 --> 01:16:18.824
Come here. Put these on.

1005
01:16:18.991 --> 01:16:20.618
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I'll hurry.

1006
01:16:20.785 --> 01:16:22.411
No. No, don't hurry.

1007
01:16:22.661 --> 01:16:26.082
You go slowly, enjoy the walk
and no one will notice you.

1008
01:16:26.499 --> 01:16:28.250
- Understand?
- Yes.

1009
01:16:56.362 --> 01:16:57.655
[sighs]

1010
01:16:59.323 --> 01:17:00.699
[sighs]

1011
01:17:02.535 --> 01:17:04.120
Billy.

1012
01:17:05.371 --> 01:17:07.123
You finally got what you deserved.

1013
01:17:17.508 --> 01:17:18.717
[screams]

1014
01:17:19.927 --> 01:17:21.595
- Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.
- Jesus!

1015
01:17:21.762 --> 01:17:23.514
Aren't you glad to see me?

1016
01:17:23.681 --> 01:17:25.975
Aren't you glad to see
old Detective Downs again?

1017
01:17:26.142 --> 01:17:27.226
Should I be?

1018
01:17:27.393 --> 01:17:30.563
I got very good notices
playing this part in Chicago.

1019
01:17:30.729 --> 01:17:31.939
Or don't you remember?

1020
01:17:32.231 --> 01:17:33.524
Let go of me, Billy.

1021
01:17:33.691 --> 01:17:36.610
[laughing] You thought I was

1022
01:17:37.444 --> 01:17:39.113
really dead,

1023
01:17:40.656 --> 01:17:41.949
didn't you?

1024
01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:47.163

1025
01:17:48.789 --> 01:17:50.499
[both screaming]

1026
01:17:52.751 --> 01:17:54.712
Did you think there were
real bullets in that gun?

1027
01:17:54.879 --> 01:17:55.754
Huh?

1028
01:17:55.921 --> 01:17:58.382
Did you think they were real
the night he came to murder you?

1029
01:17:58.549 --> 01:18:00.050
Aah. Aah!

1030
01:18:00.467 --> 01:18:02.803
I couldn't risk his
putting out your lights,

1031
01:18:02.970 --> 01:18:05.222
not before I caught up with you.

1032
01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:08.142
- Let go of me, Billy. Let--
- Never.

1033
01:18:08.309 --> 01:18:09.685
Not until you come
back in the game.

1034
01:18:09.852 --> 01:18:10.769
What game?

1035
01:18:10.936 --> 01:18:12.771
The skin game, darling.
The skin game.

1036
01:18:12.938 --> 01:18:14.273
There is no game.

1037
01:18:14.481 --> 01:18:16.275
Oh, yes. I see it so clearly.

1038
01:18:16.483 --> 01:18:18.152
No, no.

1039
01:18:18.986 --> 01:18:20.696
What do you see? Huh?

1040
01:18:22.656 --> 01:18:26.160
I see him running out of money.
I see you arranging that.

1041
01:18:26.827 --> 01:18:28.787
I see him doing the
only thing he can do.

1042
01:18:28.954 --> 01:18:32.499
I see him going to Santiago,
selling his share of the company.

1043
01:18:32.666 --> 01:18:35.002
I see him coming back with money.

1044
01:18:35.169 --> 01:18:38.505
I see us
finishing what we started.

1045
01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:40.716
You and me together.

1046
01:18:40.883 --> 01:18:43.552
We're going to make
you a rich widow.

1047
01:18:45.095 --> 01:18:46.222
[sighs]

1048
01:18:47.348 --> 01:18:48.349
No.

1049
01:18:49.516 --> 01:18:52.853
He's worth a hell of a lot more than we
got out of him the first time, darling.

1050
01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:56.482
And he's such an easy mark,
devoted as he is to you.

1051
01:18:56.941 --> 01:19:01.612
Bound together as you are
by mutual crimes and various...

1052
01:19:01.987 --> 01:19:03.489
misdemeanors.

1053
01:19:04.281 --> 01:19:06.242
- Let go of me, please.
- Beg.

1054
01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:08.827
- Please. Please, let go!
- Beg.

1055
01:19:09.036 --> 01:19:11.080
- On.
- Aah.

1056
01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:15.167
It tickles my dick when you beg.

1057
01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:19.171
He says he loves me.

1058
01:19:22.174 --> 01:19:23.884
No one loves you, Bonny.

1059
01:19:24.051 --> 01:19:25.636
No one could.

1060
01:19:26.011 --> 01:19:27.513
Except for me.

1061
01:19:29.348 --> 01:19:30.683
He does.

1062
01:19:31.058 --> 01:19:32.101
I think he does.

1063
01:19:32.268 --> 01:19:35.604
Not enough to live
the life of a fugitive.

1064
01:19:37.356 --> 01:19:39.942
Back alleys, cheap hotels...

1065
01:19:40.109 --> 01:19:41.193
It won't be like that.

1066
01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.112
Oh, how then?
Happily ever after?

1067
01:19:43.654 --> 01:19:46.448
A nice, respectable couple,
living on Main Street?

1068
01:19:46.615 --> 01:19:49.702
Sunday dinners,
walks in the park with children?

1069
01:19:50.869 --> 01:19:53.205
Christ, what's he done to you?

1070
01:19:53.872 --> 01:19:55.916
Who do you think you are?

1071
01:19:56.375 --> 01:19:57.710
Who does he think you are?

1072
01:19:57.876 --> 01:19:59.545
- Stop it.
-Hmm?

1073
01:19:59.712 --> 01:20:01.547
- You're a whore, Bonny.
- Ah.

1074
01:20:01.714 --> 01:20:04.967
A man puts his hands on you,
and you're wet...

1075
01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:06.593
[moans]

1076
01:20:07.052 --> 01:20:08.721
Is it true or not?

1077
01:20:09.555 --> 01:20:10.556
Hmm?

1078
01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:14.601
You were born one
and you'll die one.

1079
01:20:14.768 --> 01:20:17.563
Sooner than later
if the police catch up with you.

1080
01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:22.318
You wouldn't do that to me.

1081
01:20:22.568 --> 01:20:25.904
I was your first man, Bonny.
Your very first.

1082
01:20:26.739 --> 01:20:28.574
And I Will be

1083
01:20:28.741 --> 01:20:30.284
your last.

1084
01:20:31.785 --> 01:20:33.620
One way or another.

1085
01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:34.830
[groans]

1086
01:20:36.373 --> 01:20:38.876
[whispers] There's no future
with him, darling.

1087
01:20:39.710 --> 01:20:41.545
Face the truth.

1088
01:20:42.379 --> 01:20:44.548
You can't live his life.

1089
01:20:45.049 --> 01:20:46.508
And he certainly

1090
01:20:46.925 --> 01:20:48.635
can't live yours.

1091
01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:51.722
Let him go.

1092
01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:54.433
- No.
- Shh.

1093
01:20:54.641 --> 01:20:57.269
- No.
- Let him go.

1094
01:20:57.561 --> 01:20:58.729
- No.
- Shh.

1095
01:20:58.979 --> 01:21:00.481
Let him go.

1096
01:21:06.278 --> 01:21:08.822
-No.
-Yes

1097
01:21:28.258 --> 01:21:30.094
[meows]

1098
01:21:33.764 --> 01:21:34.765
[meows]

1099
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:39.478
Julia?

1100
01:21:42.147 --> 01:21:43.273
Julia?

1101
01:21:49.071 --> 01:21:51.281
Mmm, I was so hungry.

1102
01:21:54.368 --> 01:21:57.663
What about him?
We have to get rid of the body.

1103
01:21:58.038 --> 01:21:59.540
No, it's done.

1104
01:22:00.916 --> 01:22:03.168
- It's done?
- Mm-hmm.

1105
01:22:05.045 --> 01:22:06.672
You mean you did it yourself?

1106
01:22:07.548 --> 01:22:09.174
I packed all our things, as well.

1107
01:22:09.341 --> 01:22:12.136
I left one suit out on the bed,
for the train.

1108
01:22:12.970 --> 01:22:14.388
So, did you get the tickets?

1109
01:22:15.013 --> 01:22:17.433
- The tickets? Yes. Yes.
- Good.

1110
01:22:17.599 --> 01:22:19.435
We go tomorrow in the morning.

1111
01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:21.728
Back to Havana. 7:00, yes.

1112
01:22:23.564 --> 01:22:25.941
Hmm, what an adventure. Hmm?

1113
01:22:29.027 --> 01:22:30.529
Come to bed.

1114
01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:33.657
You must be exhausted.

1115
01:22:33.991 --> 01:22:34.950
I know I am.

1116
01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:36.827
Wait, wait, wait.

1117
01:22:36.994 --> 01:22:37.953
Hmm, what?

1118
01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:40.456
Have you no conscience at all?

1119
01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:42.291
I mean...

1120
01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:44.710
Yes, of course I do.

1121
01:22:44.877 --> 01:22:48.213
But you see, I don't let
it get the best of me.

1122
01:22:49.298 --> 01:22:52.384
It's just something that happened.
Something that had to be done.

1123
01:22:53.218 --> 01:22:55.679
And when something has
to be done, you do it. Right?

1124
01:22:55.846 --> 01:23:00.225
So, here's to us.
A short life, but an exciting one.

1125
01:23:01.351 --> 01:23:02.352
Mmm.

1126
01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:06.231
Good night.

1127
01:23:11.403 --> 01:23:13.071
<i>[Julia] Listen to her talk.</i>

1128
01:23:13.572 --> 01:23:16.450
<i>Listen to the words that
came out of her mouth.</i>

1129
01:23:16.617 --> 01:23:18.118
[priest] You mean Bonny?

1130
01:23:18.911 --> 01:23:20.412
Yes, Bonny.

1131
01:23:23.123 --> 01:23:25.626
Did you have no control over her?

1132
01:23:27.336 --> 01:23:29.755
No one had control over her.

1133
01:23:30.464 --> 01:23:31.965
No one did.

1134
01:23:34.927 --> 01:23:37.763
<i>No one, except for Billy.</i>

1135
01:23:39.097 --> 01:23:41.433
<i>And he wanted the rest of the money.</i>

1136
01:23:44.937 --> 01:23:47.940
<i>They found a house
in the poor section of town.</i>

1137
01:23:48.273 --> 01:23:51.944
<i>Bonny said they would go unnoticed
there, and she was right.</i>

1138
01:23:52.861 --> 01:23:55.864
<i>There were many things that
would go unnoticed in that house.</i>

1139
01:23:58.283 --> 01:24:00.786
<i>All she had to do was
get Luis to Santiago,</i>

1140
01:24:02.287 --> 01:24:04.414
<i>and it would all be over.</i>

1141
01:24:10.796 --> 01:24:13.090
No, no, no. You don't understand.

1142
01:24:13.257 --> 01:24:15.467
Hmm. We've run out?

1143
01:24:15.634 --> 01:24:17.636
Yes. I'll go tomorrow to Santiago.

1144
01:24:17.886 --> 01:24:20.305
I'll take the first
train in the morning.

1145
01:24:22.808 --> 01:24:24.476
What will you do there?

1146
01:24:24.643 --> 01:24:26.812
We need money, don't we?

1147
01:24:27.771 --> 01:24:28.772
Hmm.

1148
01:24:28.981 --> 01:24:30.816
Whatever you say.

1149
01:24:36.321 --> 01:24:37.531
[Julia cries]

1150
01:24:39.491 --> 01:24:40.534
Oh, no.

1151
01:24:42.327 --> 01:24:43.328
Julia?

1152
01:24:44.204 --> 01:24:46.081
Come on. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1153
01:24:46.248 --> 01:24:49.418
Oh, God. I don't want
you to go to Santiago.

1154
01:24:49.876 --> 01:24:51.044
But--but...

1155
01:24:51.336 --> 01:24:52.337
I have to go.

1156
01:24:52.504 --> 01:24:54.006
I don't want you to go.

1157
01:24:54.339 --> 01:24:55.882
I have no choice.

1158
01:24:57.009 --> 01:24:58.844
Yes, you do. You have a choice.

1159
01:25:00.512 --> 01:25:01.847
Once again.

1160
01:25:02.097 --> 01:25:03.682
When my hand strays
to my breast...

1161
01:25:03.849 --> 01:25:05.934
- Hearts.
- My left eardrop.

1162
01:25:06.101 --> 01:25:08.103
- Diamonds.
- My right eardrop.

1163
01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:09.938
- Clubs.
- My throat.

1164
01:25:10.105 --> 01:25:12.649
- Spades.
- Little finger of my left hand.

1165
01:25:12.816 --> 01:25:15.277
- One.
- Little finger of my right hand.

1166
01:25:15.444 --> 01:25:17.362
- Ten.
- When I do this,

1167
01:25:17.529 --> 01:25:19.823
- it means they have nothing.
- Right.

1168
01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:21.742
Mmm?

1169
01:25:21.908 --> 01:25:24.161
- King, queen, jack.
- Yes.

1170
01:25:25.454 --> 01:25:27.539
Yes. Mmm.

1171
01:25:27.706 --> 01:25:29.791
- Yeah.
- Oh, you're a natural.

1172
01:25:29.958 --> 01:25:32.044
- L-listen to me, uh--
- This is the way.

1173
01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:34.254
This is the only way.
This is our way.

1174
01:25:34.755 --> 01:25:37.424
This is you and me, together.

1175
01:25:39.593 --> 01:25:40.927
Please.

1176
01:25:44.222 --> 01:25:45.474
Now,

1177
01:25:46.058 --> 01:25:48.894
tell me what I'm holding.

1178
01:25:59.404 --> 01:26:00.405
[card player #1] All right.

1179
01:26:02.407 --> 01:26:04.076
[Julia] Would you like
some more whiskey?

1180
01:26:04.242 --> 01:26:05.243
Yes.

1181
01:26:07.079 --> 01:26:08.080
[man] Too rich for me.

1182
01:26:10.290 --> 01:26:12.459
Yes. Why not?

1183
01:26:13.627 --> 01:26:16.296
Why not, indeed? All right.

1184
01:26:17.964 --> 01:26:21.635
- He wins again.
- I'm sorry, gentlemen.

1185
01:26:22.135 --> 01:26:23.637
More champagne.

1186
01:26:28.642 --> 01:26:31.144
Does the lady mind
if I remove my coat?

1187
01:26:31.353 --> 01:26:33.355
No. Do and say as you please.

1188
01:26:33.730 --> 01:26:36.066
Try and forget that
I am even here.

1189
01:26:36.274 --> 01:26:39.695
- Easier said than done.
- [all laugh]

1190
01:26:42.614 --> 01:26:44.032
[Julia] Can I get you another drink?

1191
01:26:44.199 --> 01:26:46.618
[man] Yes, that would be lovely.

1192
01:26:49.037 --> 01:26:50.247
Thank you, my dear.

1193
01:26:51.456 --> 01:26:52.457
More whiskey?

1194
01:27:02.175 --> 01:27:04.010
[players murmuring]

1195
01:27:18.358 --> 01:27:20.944
Will you ask the lady to retire, sir?

1196
01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:26.491
- What do you mean?
- Do you have to be told?

1197
01:27:27.826 --> 01:27:31.163
Take your hand from my wife.
Please, sir.

1198
01:27:32.539 --> 01:27:33.665
Gladly.

1199
01:27:35.292 --> 01:27:37.669
If there is one thing lower
than a man who will cheat at cards,

1200
01:27:37.836 --> 01:27:41.923
it's a man who will use a woman
to do his cheating for him.

1201
01:27:51.016 --> 01:27:52.267
[grunting]

1202
01:28:10.243 --> 01:28:11.369
Ah.

1203
01:28:12.704 --> 01:28:13.705
Ah.

1204
01:28:14.039 --> 01:28:15.332
[panting]

1205
01:28:16.583 --> 01:28:17.918
Julia?

1206
01:28:25.258 --> 01:28:26.593
Well, my dear,

1207
01:28:28.762 --> 01:28:31.932
let's see what other
tricks you might know.

1208
01:28:56.289 --> 01:28:57.874
[wood snaps]

1209
01:28:58.500 --> 01:28:59.501
<i>Santisima.</i>

1210
01:28:59.918 --> 01:29:03.255
- Are you all right?
- Mm-hmm. Yes.

1211
01:29:04.256 --> 01:29:05.423
Sh-should I...

1212
01:29:06.091 --> 01:29:08.426
Should I call someone?

1213
01:29:10.804 --> 01:29:11.805
Mmm.

1214
01:29:12.764 --> 01:29:14.432
You are so kind.

1215
01:29:16.935 --> 01:29:20.230
You are so young
and innocent and kind.

1216
01:29:23.066 --> 01:29:26.778
No. No one is innocent.

1217
01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:28.196
Mmm.

1218
01:29:32.951 --> 01:29:35.120
You have a story as well.

1219
01:29:37.122 --> 01:29:38.790
Will you tell me...

1220
01:29:40.458 --> 01:29:42.127
if there's time?

1221
01:29:44.296 --> 01:29:46.298
I have no story.

1222
01:29:47.632 --> 01:29:49.217
Not like yours.

1223
01:29:50.135 --> 01:29:52.804
Well, it was Sonny's story now.

1224
01:29:54.472 --> 01:29:56.641
<i>And look what she had done.</i>

1225
01:29:59.227 --> 01:30:01.563
<i>He could not live in her world.</i>

1226
01:30:01.730 --> 01:30:04.065
<i>And she would never fit into his.</i>

1227
01:30:58.411 --> 01:31:00.664
<i>[Luis] Dear Alan--</i>

1228
01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:02.749
<i>Congratulations.</i>

1229
01:31:02.916 --> 01:31:08.797
<i>You have just purchased my share of
Vargas-Jordan Coffee Export House.</i>

1230
01:31:08.964 --> 01:31:13.009
<i>The price I have settled on
is everything that was in the safe,</i>

1231
01:31:13.176 --> 01:31:17.681
<i>which I believe is very much
in your favor. I'm sorry.</i>

1232
01:31:17.847 --> 01:31:19.391
<i>[Alan] Luis! Wait!</i>

1233
01:31:19.557 --> 01:31:22.060
<i>[Luis] I'm sorry I couldn't wait
to discuss this with you, but...</i>

1234
01:31:23.728 --> 01:31:27.691
<i>as you may know, I am now
a fugitive from justice.</i>

1235
01:31:27.857 --> 01:31:29.818
<i>More than that, I cannot say.</i>

1236
01:31:30.527 --> 01:31:32.570
What are you talking about?
What have you--

1237
01:31:32.737 --> 01:31:33.780
Murder.

1238
01:31:35.699 --> 01:31:37.117
I have done murder.

1239
01:31:37.659 --> 01:31:39.869
-No.
-Yes

1240
01:31:40.036 --> 01:31:41.538
I did it for her.

1241
01:31:42.872 --> 01:31:44.541
And the truth is

1242
01:31:45.375 --> 01:31:46.793
that I would do it again.

1243
01:31:47.752 --> 01:31:49.587
[train whistle blows]

1244
01:31:51.047 --> 01:31:52.716
Good luck to you.

1245
01:31:53.049 --> 01:31:55.552
Thank you for having
once been my friend.

1246
01:31:58.138 --> 01:31:59.472
Go on.

1247
01:32:06.146 --> 01:32:07.522
God help you.

[Bonny moaning]

1249
01:34:06.099 --> 01:34:08.101
