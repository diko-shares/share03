1
00:01:21.878 --> 00:01:24.393
"You cannot walk away from love."

2
00:01:25.148 --> 00:01:28.742
That was the advertisement in a Baltimore newspaper.

3
00:01:29.817 --> 00:01:32.651
And that is how he found her.

4
00:01:33.986 --> 00:01:37.849
She was a young woman in need of a husband.

5
00:01:38.125 --> 00:01:41.158
And he was a man who wanted a wife.

6
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.977
He's too late to talk sense to him now.

7
00:02:02.977 --> 00:02:05.378
You can't marry her, Luis.
You've never met her.

8
00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:08.430
I meet her today. The boat from America comes at 6:00,

9
00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:11.440
we marry at 9:00 by 10:00, I'm back at work.

10
00:02:11.484 --> 00:02:14.019
Ridiculous. This is ridiculous.

11
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.969
A man needs a wife, isn't that what you've been telling me?

12
00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.691
- Well, I sent for one.
- From America.

13
00:02:19.692 --> 00:02:21.250
What does she look like?

14
00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:28.485
Comes a day in every man's life when a band is playing
and he's the only one who can hear it.

15
00:02:28.785 --> 00:02:30.766
Today is your day.

16
00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:32.728
I love you, woman.

17
00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:34.958
She is not beautiful.

18
00:02:35.237 --> 00:02:37.471
She is not meant to be beautiful...

19
00:02:37.472 --> 00:02:40.803
She is meant to be kind, true and young enough to bear children.

20
00:02:41.842 --> 00:02:46.875
Go. Go on. The sun will be up any minute.
That boat will be coming in.

21
00:02:48.681 --> 00:02:53.044
But what about love, Luis?
Doesn't love come into this equation at all?

22
00:02:53.351 --> 00:02:55.312
Love is not for me, Alan.

23
00:02:55.586 --> 00:02:58.017
Love is for those people who believe in it.

24
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.380
Let's go.

25
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.027
Why are you laughing at me?
You've been laughing at me the whole morning.

26
00:03:05.027 --> 00:03:07.552
Never mind. You go! Go on!

27
00:04:25.092 --> 00:04:27.925
No, this is not a love story.

28
00:04:28.593 --> 00:04:33.458
But it is a story about love, and the power it has over our life.

29
00:04:34.166 --> 00:04:37.032
The power to heal or destroy.

30
00:04:46.274 --> 00:04:48.966
and this is where the story begins.

31
00:05:05.224 --> 00:05:06.283
Mr. Vargas?

32
00:05:08.561 --> 00:05:09.750
Luis Vargas?

33
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.050
Yes.

34
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.920
You don't recognize me, do you?

35
00:05:17.733 --> 00:05:19.167
Miss Russell?

36
00:05:20.402 --> 00:05:21.563
Yes.

37
00:05:25.072 --> 00:05:26.404
Julia Russell?

38
00:05:28.576 --> 00:05:30.237
But this, this picture...

39
00:05:30.312 --> 00:05:34.371
I've deceived you. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have. I...

40
00:05:35.248 --> 00:05:36.718
I was unsure.

41
00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:37.719
You see... I...

42
00:05:38.417 --> 00:05:43.407
I didn't want to meant to be interested in me just
because I owned a pretty face. And...

43
00:05:43.754 --> 00:05:47.788
So I sent another woman's photograph and not my own.

44
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.991
I see.

45
00:05:52.361 --> 00:05:56.223
I do hope you forgive me. I meant
to write many times. I tried.

46
00:05:56.265 --> 00:05:58.956
But my courage failed me. So l...

47
00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:06.870
And...

48
00:06:07.313 --> 00:06:08.171
Well...

49
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.902
Now I stand before you as I am, and you know the worst.

50
00:06:15.145 --> 00:06:16.206
No, no.

51
00:06:17.582 --> 00:06:18.872
Not the worst at all.

52
00:06:20.551 --> 00:06:23.913
Only, not what I was expecting.

53
00:06:24.722 --> 00:06:28.056
If my deception has altered your intentions...

54
00:06:28.056 --> 00:06:31.125
- If you're not satisfied in antway...
- No, no, no, no, it isn't that.

55
00:06:31.126 --> 00:06:34.495
I am determined to make my way back to my home in Delaware.

56
00:06:34.496 --> 00:06:37.028
- If you say so, I will.
- Miss Russell...

57
00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:39.897
Miss Russell...

58
00:06:43.568 --> 00:06:45.500
you have been honest with me.

59
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.602
I will be honest with you, too.

60
00:06:50.375 --> 00:06:53.009
I will admit to a deception of my own.

61
00:06:56.679 --> 00:06:58.914
You are exactly the image of your photograph.

62
00:06:58.916 --> 00:07:00.508
Yes, yes, I am.

63
00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:07.111
But I wrote to you that I am a clerk in
a coffee export house. I am not.

64
00:07:09.266 --> 00:07:10.043
I...

65
00:07:10.292 --> 00:07:11.725
I own the house.

66
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.187
The business is my own.

67
00:07:19.498 --> 00:07:22.166
You did not want a woman to be interested in you...

68
00:07:22.168 --> 00:07:24.732
just because you owned a pretty bank account.

69
00:07:26.437 --> 00:07:28.061
- Yes.
- Yes.

70
00:07:29.007 --> 00:07:30.063
Well...

71
00:07:31.142 --> 00:07:33.503
Then we have something in common.

72
00:07:34.744 --> 00:07:36.905
We are both not to be trusted.

73
00:07:41.517 --> 00:07:46.347
Of course, if my... if my deception has altered your intentions...

74
00:07:48.789 --> 00:07:52.651
if you are not interested in marrying a wealthy man...

75
00:07:53.391 --> 00:07:55.656
No, I think I could manage.

76
00:07:58.163 --> 00:08:01.298
If you could manage a somewhat prettier wife.

77
00:08:03.734 --> 00:08:05.566
I'll make the effort.

78
00:08:20.881 --> 00:08:22.211
Miss Russell.

79
00:08:24.117 --> 00:08:25.449
Mr. Vargas.

80
00:08:26.952 --> 00:08:30.185
Now we have all the time in the world
to get to know each other.

81
00:08:30.186 --> 00:08:31.084
Well...

82
00:08:31.022 --> 00:08:32.856
No, not all the time.

83
00:08:32.962 --> 00:08:34.156
No?

84
00:08:35.293 --> 00:08:37.893
No, we are going to be married at 9:00.

85
00:08:39.597 --> 00:08:42.928
- Well then we'd better hurry.
- Yes.

86
00:08:53.774 --> 00:08:55.264
"Take this ring...

87
00:08:56.142 --> 00:08:57.973
as a sign of my love...

88
00:09:00.078 --> 00:09:01.511
and fidelity...

89
00:09:01.913 --> 00:09:03.244
to you."

90
00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:28.800
Music!

91
00:09:29.169 --> 00:09:30.501
Music!

92
00:09:31.822 --> 00:09:33.001
Music!

93
00:09:39.643 --> 00:09:42.134
Ladies and gentlemen, a toast!

94
00:09:43.112 --> 00:09:46.476
To our groom and his beautiful...

95
00:09:46.616 --> 00:09:48.950
enchanting bride!

96
00:09:54.256 --> 00:09:55.716
Will you dance with me?

97
00:09:56.023 --> 00:09:57.354
Dance?

98
00:09:59.326 --> 00:10:00.850
I... I don't dance.

99
00:10:01.428 --> 00:10:02.991
I say you do.

100
00:10:08.034 --> 00:10:12.502
May their life together be like this dance, harmonious, smooth.

101
00:10:12.502 --> 00:10:17.407
- Dance for life never ending and...
- Alan, enough is enough.

102
00:10:17.408 --> 00:10:18.704
I'm almost through.

103
00:10:18.874 --> 00:10:21.607
You're through now. Sit down.

104
00:11:11.951 --> 00:11:13.813
- Good luck to you.
- Thank you.

105
00:11:46.012 --> 00:11:47.742
Would you like to see the house?

106
00:11:47.814 --> 00:11:51.624
- Oh, no. I can see it tomorrow.
- Yes

107
00:11:54.585 --> 00:11:57.877
You have to give me a few moments.
I'm shy of these things.

108
00:11:58.755 --> 00:12:03.551
I will give you as many moments, days, nights as you need.

109
00:12:05.862 --> 00:12:07.827
And when you want me to come to you...

110
00:12:08.465 --> 00:12:09.795
I will.

111
00:12:10.998 --> 00:12:12.329
Not before.

112
00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.427
You would do that for me?

113
00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:22.901
If you say so, yes.

114
00:12:30.013 --> 00:12:31.344
Then...

115
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:33.835
I will say good night.

116
00:12:34.846 --> 00:12:36.358
- Good night.
- Good night.

117
00:12:39.155 --> 00:12:41.422
The room is there, to the right.

118
00:12:41.595 --> 00:12:43.481
Yes. I think I'll find it.

119
00:13:57.449 --> 00:13:58.981
Awake at last.

120
00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:02.882
The day is half-gone.

121
00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.255
I'm sorry. I'm not dressed.

122
00:14:07.426 --> 00:14:10.423
I could wait outside, but then the coffee would get cold.

123
00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:11.993
No, it's all right.

124
00:14:12.496 --> 00:14:16.098
If someone brought me my coffee
every morning before I dressed...

125
00:14:16.099 --> 00:14:18.125
l would be very happy.

126
00:14:18.802 --> 00:14:20.192
It would change the day.

127
00:14:20.403 --> 00:14:21.395
But...

128
00:14:22.105 --> 00:14:24.139
you only drink tea in the morning.

129
00:14:24.139 --> 00:14:25.699
I do? No.

130
00:14:26.575 --> 00:14:30.478
When I said in my letters that I worked in
a coffee company, you wrote back...

131
00:14:30.477 --> 00:14:32.237
That was my sister.

132
00:14:32.946 --> 00:14:37.642
She believed coffee to be a sinful pleasure
so I pretended to agree with her

133
00:14:37.642 --> 00:14:42.281
and then she read all my letters to you,
I could not always tell the truth and...

134
00:14:45.523 --> 00:14:49.715
All the more reason to forget them. That's all behind you now.

135
00:14:51.662 --> 00:14:53.056
What do you think?

136
00:14:55.032 --> 00:14:56.522
About what?

137
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.063
Do you believe as my sister does...

138
00:15:02.603 --> 00:15:06.136
that pleasure could ever be sinful?

139
00:16:04.554 --> 00:16:07.045
Why did you choose an American wife?

140
00:16:07.605 --> 00:16:08.716
Well...

141
00:16:08.989 --> 00:16:11.219
Here, we are the past.

142
00:16:12.792 --> 00:16:14.623
And there, you are the future.

143
00:16:17.163 --> 00:16:20.556
Why did you choose to leave it?

144
00:16:21.165 --> 00:16:23.327
To escape the future.

145
00:16:25.103 --> 00:16:27.893
Well, to become someone else, I think.

146
00:16:30.874 --> 00:16:33.806
I am someone else with you.

147
00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:37.739
Someone more like...

148
00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:39.911
myself.

149
00:16:58.162 --> 00:17:00.357
And there, in his arms...

150
00:17:00.897 --> 00:17:02.789
she became someone else.

151
00:17:04.667 --> 00:17:06.458
Someone more like herself.

152
00:19:20.119 --> 00:19:22.946
I'm telling you man, I've never been happier.

153
00:19:23.456 --> 00:19:25.989
There's no such thing as happily married, Luis.

154
00:19:25.991 --> 00:19:29.223
It's an oxymoron, like "happily dead".

155
00:19:30.394 --> 00:19:33.865
I thought you'd be slowly finding your way
back to the whores by now.

156
00:19:33.865 --> 00:19:36.561
- Seeing some little "Creole" time.
- Not anymore.

157
00:19:36.563 --> 00:19:39.635
Anyway you've had her for yourself long enough.

158
00:19:39.635 --> 00:19:41.535
When do we get to see her again?

159
00:19:41.536 --> 00:19:45.714
Well, we're going to the theatre next week.
An American touring company she wants to see.

160
00:19:45.772 --> 00:19:47.035
Why don't you join us?

161
00:19:54.912 --> 00:19:59.105
¶ Soon comes the morning when the knell is rung... ¶

162
00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.518
¶ to take my living breath. ¶

163
00:20:01.518 --> 00:20:03.983
¶ Come, come, the night is almost done. ¶

164
00:20:08.392 --> 00:20:10.082
¶ Satan is near! ¶

165
00:20:10.926 --> 00:20:12.826
¶ The shrieking, grim and... ¶

166
00:20:12.826 --> 00:20:16.392
¶ hideous brim of hell to uncover. ¶

167
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:19.463
¶ Come, or you will share her wretched end. ¶

168
00:20:19.499 --> 00:20:22.461
¶ Hellhound! Abominable monster! ¶

169
00:20:22.602 --> 00:20:24.963
¶ Would that I had never been born! ¶

170
00:20:29.507 --> 00:20:30.869
Wonderful.
Wonderful.

171
00:20:31.709 --> 00:20:32.941
Disgusting.

172
00:20:33.611 --> 00:20:35.101
Cheap melodrama.

173
00:20:36.713 --> 00:20:39.134
¶ Was it we who forced our way to you? ¶

174
00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.440
¶ Who was it sent her to her ruin? ¶

175
00:20:41.719 --> 00:20:43.049
¶ I... ¶

176
00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:45.616
¶ or you? ¶

177
00:20:46.455 --> 00:20:50.147
¶ What evil thing has risen from the ground? ¶

178
00:20:50.457 --> 00:20:54.650
¶ Father, let angels now have charge of me... ¶

179
00:20:54.696 --> 00:20:57.728
¶ encamped around heavenly company. ¶

180
00:20:57.899 --> 00:20:59.696
¶ She is condemned to die. ¶

181
00:20:59.847 --> 00:21:03.926
¶ No, She is redeemed on high! ¶

182
00:21:03.968 --> 00:21:05.800
¶ Hither, to me! ¶

183
00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.942
Julia, my dear, you look flushed.

184
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:23.940
- Are you all right?
- Yes, yes, it's the theatre.

185
00:21:24.051 --> 00:21:25.183
I love it...

186
00:21:25.552 --> 00:21:27.814
even the cheap melodrama.

187
00:21:30.156 --> 00:21:31.551
Will you excuse me?

188
00:21:37.829 --> 00:21:39.921
Does she suffer from fevers?

189
00:21:40.532 --> 00:21:43.194
She suffers from a little too much rouge.

190
00:21:43.434 --> 00:21:47.126
Nonsense. A lady does not wear rouge.

191
00:21:47.271 --> 00:21:48.931
No, a lady doesn't.

192
00:21:49.172 --> 00:21:53.134
And a lady does not wander through the theater alone, either.

193
00:21:54.943 --> 00:21:56.273
Excuse me.

194
00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.243
Perhaps you will find the second act more appealing.

195
00:22:57.961 --> 00:23:02.689
- Excuse me, sir! The public is not allowed backstage.
- Just no... Don't put your hands on me, sir.

196
00:23:03.097 --> 00:23:05.031
That is my wife, damn it!

197
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.360
Luis, you've come to my rescue...

198
00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.260
Julia!

199
00:23:08.201 --> 00:23:09.533
Just like a play...

200
00:23:11.638 --> 00:23:13.370
What are you doing here?

201
00:23:13.539 --> 00:23:17.698
Isn't it exciting? Look at all these mysterious contraptions.

202
00:23:17.709 --> 00:23:21.639
- Who was that man?
- What man? I was lost, that's all.

203
00:23:21.879 --> 00:23:23.640
You made my heart stop.

204
00:23:23.781 --> 00:23:26.973
Feel my heart. Feel how fast it's beating?

205
00:23:31.821 --> 00:23:32.709
Christ.

206
00:23:33.522 --> 00:23:35.251
You'll be the death of me.

207
00:23:38.893 --> 00:23:40.553
I hope so.

208
00:23:44.263 --> 00:23:45.753
Places, please.

209
00:23:45.898 --> 00:23:48.589
Ladies and gentlemen, places for act two.

210
00:23:56.641 --> 00:23:58.267
Take me home now.

211
00:24:08.951 --> 00:24:11.111
My own dearest sister.

212
00:24:11.252 --> 00:24:16.985
I can't understand why you treat me thus.
It is many weeks now since you left me.

213
00:24:17.058 --> 00:24:21.387
And in all that time, no word from you
to tell me of your safe arrival...

214
00:24:21.427 --> 00:24:25.620
whether you've met Mr. Vargas, whether
the marriage has taken place or not.

215
00:24:25.763 --> 00:24:27.491
What am I to think?

216
00:24:27.999 --> 00:24:30.962
I have already contacted the embassy in Havana...

217
00:24:30.968 --> 00:24:33.402
and the authorities there in Santiago.

218
00:24:33.404 --> 00:24:36.402
I know how you feel about her, but...

219
00:24:36.839 --> 00:24:38.239
you have to write.

220
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:43.572
You have to write, before she has the police on us.

221
00:24:43.776 --> 00:24:46.309
Yes, you're right. I've been unkind to her.

222
00:24:46.581 --> 00:24:49.944
Although she has never been kind to me.

223
00:24:51.651 --> 00:24:53.677
Just... do it.

224
00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:57.485
Do it, then it's done.

225
00:24:57.556 --> 00:24:59.447
No, no, no!

226
00:24:59.848 --> 00:25:00.648
No, no.

227
00:25:01.192 --> 00:25:05.425
- No, no!
- It's all right. All right. It's me. It's me, Luis.

228
00:25:06.429 --> 00:25:07.761
You were dreaming.

229
00:25:09.699 --> 00:25:11.031
Are you all right?

230
00:25:15.505 --> 00:25:17.736
That's it. That's it.

231
00:25:18.071 --> 00:25:20.933
You were just dreaming, just dreaming.

232
00:25:23.576 --> 00:25:24.907
It's all right.

233
00:25:26.712 --> 00:25:28.544
It was just a dream.

234
00:25:28.882 --> 00:25:31.311
A bad one, that's all.

235
00:25:31.311 --> 00:25:32.311
that's all.

236
00:25:40.524 --> 00:25:41.718
It was just a dream.

237
00:25:42.092 --> 00:25:44.360
Are you all right? You need something?

238
00:25:44.361 --> 00:25:45.350
You.

239
00:25:46.161 --> 00:25:47.493
I'm sorry.

240
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:49.990
You are here with me. Secure.

241
00:25:50.265 --> 00:25:52.063
You're all right.

242
00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.023
Will you stay?

243
00:25:54.201 --> 00:25:55.532
Of course.

244
00:25:56.736 --> 00:25:58.068
Of course.

245
00:25:59.873 --> 00:26:01.533
It's all right.

246
00:26:32.999 --> 00:26:35.160
Luis, don't go.

247
00:26:37.504 --> 00:26:40.266
How is the queen of the house this morning?

248
00:26:44.908 --> 00:26:47.570
Look. See? I've done it.

249
00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:52.273
This is for the best. Thank you.

250
00:26:52.348 --> 00:26:56.218
- I'll have Sara post it this morning.
- No need. I can do it myself.

251
00:26:56.219 --> 00:26:58.287
- I haven't addressed it.
- I'll do it.

252
00:26:58.287 --> 00:27:01.201
I have the address at the office.
Then it's the sooner on its way.

253
00:27:01.202 --> 00:27:02.202
- Come on.
- Yes.

254
00:27:10.997 --> 00:27:12.559
What will you do today?

255
00:27:12.865 --> 00:27:16.399
I'm going to an English dressmaker at the Plaza Vieja.

256
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:20.429
You'll need some money.

257
00:27:22.176 --> 00:27:24.901
Sign here, Señora.

258
00:27:26.543 --> 00:27:29.911
Did yo wish to book this for both your
personal and business account?

259
00:27:29.911 --> 00:27:31.469
Yes, thank you.

260
00:27:31.848 --> 00:27:34.940
I want my wife to have free use of all my accounts.

261
00:27:35.249 --> 00:27:36.307
There you are.

262
00:27:36.384 --> 00:27:38.847
How should I sign?
Do l use my Christian name?

263
00:27:39.086 --> 00:27:40.552
No, no, your married name.

264
00:27:40.854 --> 00:27:44.454
And then you have to remember to
repeat the signature exactly...

265
00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:46.522
each time you draw a check.

266
00:27:46.825 --> 00:27:48.485
I will try.

267
00:27:59.335 --> 00:28:00.997
Oh, man!

268
00:28:09.976 --> 00:28:14.261
So, Luis, is it love after all or is it just lust?

269
00:28:15.816 --> 00:28:17.014
Is there a difference?

270
00:28:17.315 --> 00:28:18.510
Oh, yes.

271
00:28:18.718 --> 00:28:22.548
To love someone is to give and then you want to give more.

272
00:28:22.987 --> 00:28:24.512
And lust?

273
00:28:24.791 --> 00:28:26.288
What is the lust, Alan?

274
00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:30.453
Lust is to take and then take more.

275
00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:33.558
To devour, to consume.
No logic, no reason.

276
00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:36.562
So... give, take.

277
00:28:37.366 --> 00:28:38.732
Which is it?

278
00:28:39.201 --> 00:28:40.531
Both.

279
00:28:43.504 --> 00:28:45.395
I want to give her everything.

280
00:28:47.106 --> 00:28:49.371
And I want to take everything from her.

281
00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:54.074
Oh, Luis. You are a lost man.

282
00:28:54.448 --> 00:28:55.778
No, no.

283
00:28:57.816 --> 00:29:00.246
I think she is the one who seems to be lost.

284
00:29:00.652 --> 00:29:04.514
How, why, I don't know.
But that will change.

285
00:29:05.554 --> 00:29:07.286
I can change that.

286
00:29:14.296 --> 00:29:15.555
Mr. Vargas, is it?

287
00:29:16.749 --> 00:29:17.455
Yes.

288
00:29:17.833 --> 00:29:20.297
Walter Downs. I didn't mean to startle you.

289
00:29:20.401 --> 00:29:22.894
- That's allright.
- They told me that I find you upstairs.

290
00:29:22.894 --> 00:29:24.670
- What can I do for you?
- Small matter.

291
00:29:24.671 --> 00:29:27.773
Hardly worth your trouble. I've been engaged by Miss Russell.

292
00:29:27.773 --> 00:29:28.998
You mean, Julia?

293
00:29:29.141 --> 00:29:31.572
No, Emily. Julia's sister.

294
00:29:31.942 --> 00:29:32.868
In Delaware.

295
00:29:32.944 --> 00:29:34.909
I'm a private investigator.

296
00:29:35.212 --> 00:29:37.312
I recently arrived from Wilmington.

297
00:29:37.613 --> 00:29:42.284
I understand. I mean, l know Miss Russell has been distressed.

298
00:29:42.285 --> 00:29:45.454
But we have written to her several weeks ago.

299
00:29:45.653 --> 00:29:50.225
I'm sure when she receives the letter,
she will be much relieved.

300
00:29:50.226 --> 00:29:52.250
Then Miss Julia is all right?

301
00:29:52.626 --> 00:29:54.280
Yes, more than all right...

302
00:29:54.481 --> 00:29:55.932
and more than Miss Julia.

303
00:29:56.162 --> 00:29:57.929
She's Señora Vargas.
She is my wife.

304
00:29:57.929 --> 00:29:59.419
So you are married?

305
00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:03.668
- Very good news.
- Happily married.

306
00:30:03.668 --> 00:30:05.726
Oh, yes. I can see that.

307
00:30:06.038 --> 00:30:09.401
What a mystery a happy marriage is.

308
00:30:09.608 --> 00:30:12.441
A bloom in the cheek, the spark in the eye.

309
00:30:13.109 --> 00:30:15.445
- It shows, I guess.
- Oh, yes, indeed.

310
00:30:15.445 --> 00:30:17.940
And miss Russell will be pleased to hear of it.

311
00:30:18.347 --> 00:30:20.516
I would appreciate if you can tell her that.

312
00:30:20.582 --> 00:30:21.679
I will indeed.

313
00:30:22.693 --> 00:30:23.380
Thank you.

314
00:30:23.484 --> 00:30:27.246
And I'll be even more convincing in my
report when I've met your wife.

315
00:30:30.524 --> 00:30:31.683
Yes, yes.

316
00:30:32.558 --> 00:30:33.490
Why not?

317
00:30:34.633 --> 00:30:35.690
You see,

318
00:30:36.629 --> 00:30:38.921
We will be home on Sunday afternoon.

319
00:30:39.482 --> 00:30:41.528
You want to come by for a coffee?

320
00:30:41.699 --> 00:30:42.688
Yes, I will.

321
00:30:42.766 --> 00:30:46.367
And please convey to your wife how much
I'm looking forward to seeing her.

322
00:30:46.967 --> 00:30:47.767
Well.

323
00:30:57.539 --> 00:30:59.817
Oh, yes please outside On the terrace.

324
00:30:59.918 --> 00:31:01.346
- Thank you.
- Go, go.

325
00:31:01.347 --> 00:31:02.578
Do as she says.

326
00:31:02.678 --> 00:31:03.678
Luis.

327
00:31:06.152 --> 00:31:07.882
Oh, Just in time.

328
00:31:08.788 --> 00:31:12.351
This one is for Sunday paseo, and this one for weekdays.
What do you think?

329
00:31:12.457 --> 00:31:14.548
Fine, fine.

330
00:31:15.726 --> 00:31:17.317
And the rest?

331
00:31:17.528 --> 00:31:19.392
This one I like.

332
00:31:20.162 --> 00:31:23.264
What do you mean? There are seven days in a week.

333
00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.243
What about your trunk?
Is there nothing in there?

334
00:31:26.243 --> 00:31:30.103
No, nothing good. Anyway, I've lost the key.

335
00:31:30.104 --> 00:31:33.899
We'll get a locksmith. It's an easy job. Actually...

336
00:31:33.941 --> 00:31:35.840
l'll do it myself.

337
00:31:37.244 --> 00:31:40.277
No, I want to show you something. Come here.

338
00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:44.149
You have to leave now. I'm going to kiss my husband.

339
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:46.818
And then we're going to take a bath.

340
00:32:03.699 --> 00:32:05.360
What do I smell?

341
00:32:06.067 --> 00:32:07.467
My perfume.

342
00:32:07.767 --> 00:32:08.928
No.

343
00:32:10.836 --> 00:32:12.168
A cigar.

344
00:32:13.806 --> 00:32:15.296
I tried one.

345
00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:19.100
One of my cigars?

346
00:32:19.911 --> 00:32:22.344
I wanted the taste of you in my mouth.

347
00:32:26.117 --> 00:32:28.307
- You have no shame at all.
- No.

348
00:32:29.153 --> 00:32:31.651
No, there is no shame in loving each other.

349
00:32:32.288 --> 00:32:34.279
Do you love me? Julia?

350
00:32:34.956 --> 00:32:36.617
Do you love me?

351
00:32:37.524 --> 00:32:39.854
Or are you not the loving kind?

352
00:33:19.825 --> 00:33:21.655
I forgot to tell you.

353
00:33:23.595 --> 00:33:26.186
We have a visitor coming on Sunday.

354
00:33:27.264 --> 00:33:28.664
We do?

355
00:33:29.701 --> 00:33:30.562
Yes...

356
00:33:31.102 --> 00:33:33.462
a genuine private investigator...

357
00:33:34.873 --> 00:33:37.232
coming all the way from Delaware.

358
00:33:38.741 --> 00:33:40.972
So, Emily sent him.

359
00:33:41.243 --> 00:33:44.008
Yeah. Detective Downs.

360
00:33:44.313 --> 00:33:46.174
Detective Downs, did you say?

361
00:33:46.581 --> 00:33:49.579
Don't be worry, he only needs to see that you're well...

362
00:33:50.183 --> 00:33:52.745
and happy and truly my wife.

363
00:33:53.852 --> 00:33:58.387
- And then this nonsense will be over.
- When will that damn bird stop screaming?

364
00:34:00.325 --> 00:34:01.485
Julia?

365
00:34:07.592 --> 00:34:08.891
Careful, careful, careful.

366
00:34:08.891 --> 00:34:10.225
It's coming, it's coming.

367
00:34:24.545 --> 00:34:26.206
Oh, no.

368
00:34:27.959 --> 00:34:28.975
No.

369
00:34:30.916 --> 00:34:33.976
Don Luis, look. He's dead.

370
00:34:35.319 --> 00:34:36.810
He was just singing.

371
00:34:36.922 --> 00:34:39.454
Well, he's not singing now, is he?

372
00:34:40.524 --> 00:34:43.488
Looks like he got his little neck broken.

373
00:34:44.325 --> 00:34:48.360
Take him away. I don't want Julia to see him.

374
00:35:41.038 --> 00:35:43.673
How does a person die on this instrument?

375
00:35:46.043 --> 00:35:47.875
I believe that...

376
00:35:49.645 --> 00:35:52.712
the turning of the wheel breaks the neck of the person.

377
00:35:53.682 --> 00:35:55.343
And if it doesn't?

378
00:35:56.418 --> 00:35:58.248
Does the person then strangle?

379
00:36:00.319 --> 00:36:01.550
Are you afraid?

380
00:36:05.025 --> 00:36:06.014
No.

381
00:36:06.759 --> 00:36:08.750
Julia is not afraid.

382
00:36:10.629 --> 00:36:12.197
But Bonny is.

383
00:36:13.899 --> 00:36:15.566
I don't understand.

384
00:36:16.593 --> 00:36:18.092
Who is Bonny?

385
00:36:22.872 --> 00:36:24.340
Who is Bonny?

386
00:36:26.409 --> 00:36:28.369
I'm looking for Mr. Vargas.

387
00:36:28.511 --> 00:36:31.008
That is a question that Luis would soon be asking.

388
00:36:36.817 --> 00:36:38.148
Mr. Vargas?

389
00:36:39.085 --> 00:36:40.416
My name is Russell.

390
00:36:41.288 --> 00:36:42.688
Emily Russell.

391
00:36:42.988 --> 00:36:44.718
I am Julia's sister.

392
00:36:46.257 --> 00:36:51.451
So you understand how upset I was to receive this letter.

393
00:36:51.696 --> 00:36:52.855
Upset?

394
00:36:53.163 --> 00:36:57.528
But... l thought you would be pleased to receive it.

395
00:36:58.836 --> 00:37:00.666
This letter, sir...

396
00:37:01.337 --> 00:37:04.699
Which was written in answer to the one I last sent her...

397
00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:07.271
and which is signed in her name...

398
00:37:07.675 --> 00:37:09.666
is not from Julia.

399
00:37:11.412 --> 00:37:14.055
Of course it is. Of course.

400
00:37:14.514 --> 00:37:15.708
I mailed it myself.

401
00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:17.850
This letter was not written by my sister.

402
00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:19.382
Miss Russell.

403
00:37:24.689 --> 00:37:25.936
I'm sorry.

404
00:37:26.443 --> 00:37:27.338
I'm sorry.

405
00:37:27.358 --> 00:37:32.323
- Don't be upset, please. I swear to you...
- Swear as much as you like.

406
00:37:36.131 --> 00:37:39.922
That is not Julia's handwriting.

407
00:37:40.169 --> 00:37:42.735
That is the handwriting of a stranger.

408
00:37:43.137 --> 00:37:44.967
A person unknown.

409
00:37:45.974 --> 00:37:47.363
At least to me.

410
00:38:16.363 --> 00:38:19.366
- Where is she?
- Senior, I was going to send for you.

411
00:38:19.367 --> 00:38:20.797
Where is she?

412
00:38:21.835 --> 00:38:22.543
Go away. Go away.

413
00:38:22.544 --> 00:38:24.667
- Oh, senior
- Get out!

414
00:38:34.745 --> 00:38:35.806
Where did she go, Sara?

415
00:38:35.807 --> 00:38:40.173
I don't know. She sent me to the post office.
And when I come back...

416
00:39:20.049 --> 00:39:23.376
She's not coming back, is she, Sara?

417
00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:25.118
She never was here.

418
00:39:26.921 --> 00:39:29.212
You've been married to a dream.

419
00:39:29.989 --> 00:39:32.254
A dream that stole your soul.

420
00:39:57.978 --> 00:40:00.272
Luis! What is it?

421
00:40:05.551 --> 00:40:10.518
Your wife appeared at five minutes to three
for a last-minute withdrawal.

422
00:40:10.654 --> 00:40:15.189
As you have instructed us, I gave her
full access to your accounts.

423
00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:18.318
Your balance at closing time was...

424
00:40:18.596 --> 00:40:21.932
51 American dollars and 40 cents in one account...

425
00:40:21.932 --> 00:40:23.762
ten dollars in the other.

426
00:40:28.803 --> 00:40:32.639
As I explained to your wife, to have closed
the both out completely...

427
00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:35.503
your own signature would have been necessary.

428
00:40:40.979 --> 00:40:42.310
I'm sorry.

429
00:41:11.538 --> 00:41:12.969
Don Luis?

430
00:41:44.865 --> 00:41:47.497
God must have been angry with you that day...

431
00:41:47.701 --> 00:41:50.992
he let you look in that woman's face.

432
00:42:04.247 --> 00:42:06.909
I want her back, Sara.

433
00:42:09.484 --> 00:42:11.144
I want her back.

434
00:42:14.088 --> 00:42:17.615
No, no, cariño. What for?

435
00:42:19.226 --> 00:42:21.917
What for you want her back again?

436
00:43:57.346 --> 00:43:59.707
No, this is not a love story.

437
00:44:01.351 --> 00:44:03.712
But it is a story about love.

438
00:44:06.022 --> 00:44:09.952
About those who give in to it, and the price they pay.

439
00:44:13.142 --> 00:44:16.724
And those who run away from it because they are afraid...

440
00:44:17.998 --> 00:44:21.630
or because they do not believe they are worthy of it.

441
00:44:24.137 --> 00:44:25.798
She ran away.

442
00:44:26.704 --> 00:44:28.035
He gave in.

443
00:44:28.438 --> 00:44:29.668
Mr. Vargas?

444
00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:31.370
Yeah.

445
00:44:31.741 --> 00:44:33.102
Walter Downs.

446
00:44:36.579 --> 00:44:38.573
What a happy coincidence.

447
00:44:39.981 --> 00:44:41.312
Oh, yeah.

448
00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:44.212
I remember you.

449
00:44:50.323 --> 00:44:53.497
And the authorities here, they could do nothing?

450
00:44:53.498 --> 00:44:55.665
Oh, no, no.

451
00:44:56.962 --> 00:44:58.923
After all...

452
00:45:00.566 --> 00:45:02.426
there was no crime.

453
00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:08.835
She was my wife. She... she just took what I had given her.

454
00:45:11.173 --> 00:45:12.605
Your money.

455
00:45:14.676 --> 00:45:16.209
And your love.

456
00:45:18.814 --> 00:45:20.441
And you did not suspect?

457
00:45:25.585 --> 00:45:30.920
It seems that, that I know a lot less
about women than I thought I did.

458
00:45:31.723 --> 00:45:32.985
And I know too much.

459
00:45:33.346 --> 00:45:36.082
Consequently, I've not much use for them...

460
00:45:36.228 --> 00:45:38.018
apart from the necessities.

461
00:45:38.461 --> 00:45:41.424
For real intercourse, I prefer the company of men.

462
00:45:43.199 --> 00:45:44.530
Listen to me.

463
00:45:46.169 --> 00:45:47.730
Could you find her?

464
00:45:51.906 --> 00:45:53.238
Perhaps.

465
00:45:54.975 --> 00:45:57.808
But I am, at the moment...

466
00:45:57.808 --> 00:46:02.203
engaged to find the real Julia, the one
you were meant to marry.

467
00:46:04.484 --> 00:46:06.244
Have you found her?

468
00:46:07.119 --> 00:46:09.409
Have you found her?

469
00:46:11.488 --> 00:46:12.785
Not yet.

470
00:46:12.956 --> 00:46:15.150
If you do... if you do...

471
00:46:15.324 --> 00:46:18.602
she might lead you to the Julia I married.

472
00:46:20.195 --> 00:46:21.392
Perhaps.

473
00:46:22.332 --> 00:46:23.962
And vice versa.

474
00:46:26.633 --> 00:46:31.298
As much as you want I will pay, if you can find her for me.

475
00:46:31.705 --> 00:46:33.335
That's all I want.

476
00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:36.933
And then I assume you have made up your losses.

477
00:46:38.077 --> 00:46:41.210
As much as you want, I will pay, I said it.

478
00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.610
I will pay it.

479
00:46:42.681 --> 00:46:45.211
Yes, I believe you would.

480
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:48.041
And if I did find your Julia?

481
00:46:48.385 --> 00:46:50.853
If I brought her to you...

482
00:46:51.655 --> 00:46:53.418
or you to her...

483
00:46:54.824 --> 00:46:57.786
what good would it possibly do you now?

484
00:46:58.061 --> 00:46:59.252
Money's gone.

485
00:47:01.162 --> 00:47:02.493
The love...

486
00:47:03.262 --> 00:47:04.559
ruined.

487
00:47:05.865 --> 00:47:08.195
What could you possibly want with her?

488
00:47:10.236 --> 00:47:12.067
What could you possibly want?

489
00:47:18.275 --> 00:47:19.770
I want to kill her.

490
00:47:41.693 --> 00:47:44.462
Yes. Yes, I do recall this lady.

491
00:47:44.696 --> 00:47:47.027
Slim and dark and very...

492
00:47:47.866 --> 00:47:52.263
I remember, coming along the deck and
the breeze catching her skirt.

493
00:47:52.536 --> 00:47:54.026
She was coming towards me.

494
00:47:54.203 --> 00:47:59.102
Then she quickly held it down with her
hand and as she passed, she smiled.

495
00:47:59.808 --> 00:48:03.041
I believe she was traveling with a troupe of American actors...

496
00:48:03.042 --> 00:48:04.207
touring the island.

497
00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:06.641
Oh, yes, I remember.

498
00:48:07.215 --> 00:48:10.509
Because she rolled up some lettuce in her napkin.

499
00:48:11.051 --> 00:48:12.684
I thought it was strange.

500
00:48:12.875 --> 00:48:15.387
But then she explained it was for her bird.

501
00:48:15.388 --> 00:48:17.579
She was traveling with a bird.

502
00:48:17.889 --> 00:48:20.624
Oh, yes. Yes, I remember her.

503
00:48:21.026 --> 00:48:23.495
A lady with a birdcage...

504
00:48:24.529 --> 00:48:26.887
but this doesnt look like her.

505
00:48:27.065 --> 00:48:29.461
She was young and very pretty.

506
00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:32.623
Oh, yes, that's her.

507
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:37.334
And the real Julia never appears, because...

508
00:48:37.738 --> 00:48:38.999
she is dead.

509
00:48:40.915 --> 00:48:41.963
You mean...

510
00:48:42.506 --> 00:48:44.520
- You mean murder.
- Yes.

511
00:48:46.047 --> 00:48:48.348
Or she could have had an accomplice.

512
00:48:48.348 --> 00:48:50.978
These women often have an accomplice.

513
00:48:51.017 --> 00:48:53.980
Someone she might use and then discard.

514
00:48:54.253 --> 00:48:58.787
Someone who might even now be in pursuit of her,
just as you and I are.

515
00:49:00.658 --> 00:49:02.349
And this is where it happened.

516
00:49:02.925 --> 00:49:05.016
Here in Havana.

517
00:50:05.476 --> 00:50:08.108
This way, gentlemen. And welcome to Havana.

518
00:50:08.279 --> 00:50:14.096
Mr. Downs will be in room 37 and Mr. Vargas
will be just down the hall in room 42.

519
00:50:14.501 --> 00:50:15.496
Thank you.

520
00:50:16.502 --> 00:50:20.035
I'll hook myself up with the local authorities...

521
00:50:20.607 --> 00:50:23.798
and see if any dead bodies have turned up recently.

522
00:50:24.041 --> 00:50:25.805
You're welcome to join me.

523
00:50:28.044 --> 00:50:29.977
No, no, thank you.

524
00:50:30.979 --> 00:50:35.480
Havana is a very accommodating city,
especially during Carnival.

525
00:50:35.684 --> 00:50:40.217
I suggest the Opera Restaurant, sir.
It's just across the street.

526
00:50:41.196 --> 00:50:42.118
Thank you.

527
00:50:42.189 --> 00:50:44.880
It's very popular with the American tourists.

528
00:50:50.097 --> 00:50:53.357
Why don't you do something pleasant tonight?

529
00:50:53.731 --> 00:50:58.425
Treat yourself to a good dinner, a good cigar and a good whore.

530
00:50:59.370 --> 00:51:01.826
I prefer to be alone. Thank you.

531
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:10.371
So I'll leave you on your own then.

532
00:51:11.401 --> 00:51:12.412
Good night.

533
00:52:11.493 --> 00:52:12.482
Here you are.

534
00:52:12.928 --> 00:52:16.598
Privacy, and a view of the room. If you see anything...

535
00:52:16.598 --> 00:52:22.435
or anyone who interests you, let me know
and I'll see what I can arrange.

536
00:52:23.623 --> 00:52:24.535
Thank you.

537
00:52:39.917 --> 00:52:44.817
If I could have my coffee every morning before
I dressed, I would be very happy.

538
00:52:44.887 --> 00:52:46.877
It would change the day.

539
00:52:48.691 --> 00:52:50.352
I would be very happy.

540
00:52:50.425 --> 00:52:52.416
It would change the day.

541
00:52:53.795 --> 00:52:55.895
Then that is what you shall have.

542
00:52:55.896 --> 00:53:00.533
When we are married, you shall have everything you wish.

543
00:53:01.468 --> 00:53:04.636
Married? Your wife might have something to say about that.

544
00:53:05.069 --> 00:53:07.135
This way, Colonel, s'il vous plaît.

545
00:53:07.306 --> 00:53:09.997
S'il vous plaît indeed, you silly mountebank.

546
00:53:10.075 --> 00:53:13.066
- You're about as French as my asshole!
- Edwin, curb your tongue.

547
00:53:13.067 --> 00:53:14.067
Yes, ma'am.

548
00:53:24.552 --> 00:53:26.613
May I help you, sir?

549
00:53:27.621 --> 00:53:30.346
I thought I saw an old friend of mine.

550
00:53:30.625 --> 00:53:31.592
Colonel...

551
00:53:31.658 --> 00:53:33.125
- Colonel Worth?
- Yes.

552
00:53:33.194 --> 00:53:34.661
Oh, yes. This way.

553
00:53:34.794 --> 00:53:36.091
No, no, no. I...

554
00:53:36.895 --> 00:53:38.954
I wouldn't bother him now.

555
00:53:40.164 --> 00:53:41.691
Is he staying at the hotel?

556
00:53:41.767 --> 00:53:46.130
No, he's at home in Havana.
He lives at avenida Medios.

557
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:49.061
I believe his fiancée is at the hotel.

558
00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:51.229
His fiancée?

559
00:53:51.307 --> 00:53:53.139
Yes, Miss Castle.

560
00:53:54.944 --> 00:53:56.502
Yes, yes, yes.

561
00:53:57.146 --> 00:53:59.407
I see. Thank you.

562
00:54:22.833 --> 00:54:25.500
My dear, I don't have that kind of money.

563
00:54:25.502 --> 00:54:27.095
But, my dear, you do.

564
00:54:27.503 --> 00:54:30.801
Your annual expenditures are $200,000, more or less.

565
00:54:30.802 --> 00:54:31.802
How...

566
00:54:32.107 --> 00:54:33.631
How do you know that?

567
00:54:33.808 --> 00:54:41.448
Because, under favorable conditions, you could realize at least
1.5 million pounds of sugar worth in good seasons.

568
00:54:41.448 --> 00:54:43.049
- Five cents a pound...
- No, don't, don't.

569
00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:47.009
Don't make me talk about business now.

570
00:54:50.522 --> 00:54:52.853
I've been waiting for this all night.

571
00:55:02.331 --> 00:55:04.356
Now, don't watch.

572
00:55:04.867 --> 00:55:06.597
Be kind, my dove.

573
00:55:07.369 --> 00:55:10.263
- Be kind to an old man.
- I am kind.

574
00:55:10.538 --> 00:55:12.266
Kind as I have ever been.

575
00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:24.541
Will you undo my dress, please?

576
00:55:25.282 --> 00:55:27.082
Oh, yes.

577
00:55:27.352 --> 00:55:29.252
Let me have that pleasure.

578
00:55:34.589 --> 00:55:36.321
That's enough. Thank you.

579
00:55:36.958 --> 00:55:38.055
Thank you...

580
00:55:38.994 --> 00:55:41.094
for a wonderful evening. Good night.

581
00:55:41.094 --> 00:55:42.357
- No.
- Yes.

582
00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:45.759
I'll behave. I'll only sit and watch you.

583
00:55:46.466 --> 00:55:47.797
You see...

584
00:55:48.368 --> 00:55:50.029
I sit...

585
00:55:50.736 --> 00:55:51.964
and I watch.

586
00:55:52.104 --> 00:55:54.499
- Is that what you want?
- You know.

587
00:55:55.741 --> 00:55:59.205
You are very tiresome and I am very tired.

588
00:56:00.212 --> 00:56:01.735
- Good night.
- No.

589
00:56:03.017 --> 00:56:04.316
- No.
- Good night.

590
00:56:04.268 --> 00:56:06.147
- No.
- Yes, goog night.

591
00:56:06.149 --> 00:56:07.309
No.

592
00:56:07.985 --> 00:56:11.347
Mayn't I stay? Please, let me stay.

593
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:18.481
Darling dove, I'm weeping.

594
00:56:19.027 --> 00:56:21.188
My heart is pudding.

595
00:56:23.863 --> 00:56:25.058
I'll go.

596
00:56:25.866 --> 00:56:28.356
But my pudding is all broken.

597
00:56:30.067 --> 00:56:31.295
Good night...

598
00:56:32.136 --> 00:56:33.866
my little dove.

599
00:56:35.139 --> 00:56:36.471
Good night.

600
00:56:37.974 --> 00:56:40.335
"Parting is such sweet sorrow."

601
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:32.141
It's only me, Julia.

602
00:57:35.921 --> 00:57:38.452
You haven't forgotten me, have you?

603
00:57:43.894 --> 00:57:45.385
Who's Billy?

604
00:57:47.365 --> 00:57:49.026
Just a fellow.

605
00:57:51.301 --> 00:57:54.062
There must be quite a few fellows in your life.

606
00:57:55.469 --> 00:57:56.731
Billy...

607
00:57:57.671 --> 00:57:58.900
me...

608
00:57:59.673 --> 00:58:01.005
the Colonel.

609
00:58:01.975 --> 00:58:03.636
Did you marry all of them?

610
00:58:03.843 --> 00:58:06.540
- No, just you.
- Oh, Liar.

611
00:58:07.813 --> 00:58:09.178
Liar.

612
00:58:13.685 --> 00:58:15.015
Liar.

613
00:58:22.827 --> 00:58:24.726
Well, what is it, then?

614
00:58:24.928 --> 00:58:26.765
- What is it?
- Yes.

615
00:58:27.163 --> 00:58:28.920
What are your plans for me?

616
00:58:29.564 --> 00:58:30.930
My plans?

617
00:58:32.467 --> 00:58:34.798
I just came here to kill you.

618
00:58:43.209 --> 00:58:44.700
My God.

619
00:58:48.212 --> 00:58:50.203
All right, do it.

620
00:58:58.421 --> 00:59:00.886
There. There's my heart. Don't hesitate.

621
00:59:01.156 --> 00:59:03.180
Your money's gone. Do it.

622
00:59:03.026 --> 00:59:04.186
Gone.

623
00:59:05.394 --> 00:59:07.157
Like the woman you murdered?

624
00:59:09.563 --> 00:59:10.552
What? No.

625
00:59:10.869 --> 00:59:11.698
Yes.

626
00:59:11.799 --> 00:59:15.295
- You were with her on that boat!
- Believe what you heard from me.

627
00:59:15.295 --> 00:59:17.731
You were seen together!

628
00:59:19.203 --> 00:59:22.407
- I wasn't alone.
- She told you all about me, didn't she?

629
00:59:22.408 --> 00:59:23.600
No!

630
00:59:24.276 --> 00:59:25.799
I told him!

631
00:59:26.344 --> 00:59:27.592
And he came to me next morning,

632
00:59:27.594 --> 00:59:31.663
he told me that she had met with an accident
and l have to take her place and So I did.

633
00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:34.014
Another man?

634
00:59:34.552 --> 00:59:35.882
Accomplice?

635
00:59:35.951 --> 00:59:37.747
Friend? Lover?

636
00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:39.150
An accomplice...

637
00:59:40.755 --> 00:59:44.447
You saw us together, backstage, at the play.

638
00:59:45.259 --> 00:59:47.653
My friend, my accomplice and...

639
00:59:47.894 --> 00:59:50.260
yes, yes, my lover.

640
00:59:50.732 --> 00:59:54.263
He was an actor, like myself. Actors playing parts.

641
00:59:55.767 --> 00:59:58.332
I told him that night, I told him I didn't
want to go through with it.

642
00:59:58.566 --> 01:00:00.233
I couldn't go through with it anymore.

643
01:00:00.372 --> 01:00:01.702
Why not?
Why not?

644
01:00:01.738 --> 01:00:03.201
Because...

645
01:00:03.809 --> 01:00:05.709
Because I was...

646
01:00:06.143 --> 01:00:08.577
Damn it. I was falling in love with my own husband.

647
01:00:08.578 --> 01:00:10.239
Again. Again.

648
01:00:13.181 --> 01:00:17.044
I could have... l could have bought him off!
I could have kept him away!

649
01:00:17.185 --> 01:00:20.254
But you made me write to her sister and then it was all over!

650
01:00:20.355 --> 01:00:21.344
Whore!

651
01:00:21.788 --> 01:00:22.915
Thief!

652
01:00:24.490 --> 01:00:27.325
It's how I live. It's all I know.

653
01:00:27.326 --> 01:00:30.722
I took the money and I gave it to him.

654
01:00:31.879 --> 01:00:32.722
No...

655
01:00:32.797 --> 01:00:34.788
And then I ran.

656
01:00:40.536 --> 01:00:42.197
What does it matter?

657
01:00:42.406 --> 01:00:44.032
What does it matter?

658
01:00:44.107 --> 01:00:45.403
It's over.

659
01:00:48.009 --> 01:00:49.407
Whore!

660
01:00:49.478 --> 01:00:51.002
Liar! Thief!

661
01:00:51.178 --> 01:00:52.075
Yes!

662
01:00:52.147 --> 01:00:53.776
- Yes! Yes.
- Don't you see...

663
01:00:53.776 --> 01:00:54.776
Don't you see...

664
01:00:55.582 --> 01:00:58.317
Don't you see that I cannot breathe without you?

665
01:00:58.418 --> 01:00:59.910
I cannot live without you!

666
01:01:00.018 --> 01:01:02.981
Don't you see that?
Don't you see how much I love you?

667
01:01:09.361 --> 01:01:11.591
I'm sorry.

668
01:01:47.625 --> 01:01:49.286
Where am l?

669
01:01:53.296 --> 01:01:54.625
Who are you?

670
01:01:58.665 --> 01:01:59.792
Really.

671
01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:02.361
My name is Bonny.

672
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:05.160
Bonny Castle.

673
01:02:07.307 --> 01:02:08.797
Bonny Castle.

674
01:02:12.976 --> 01:02:15.003
Is that your Christian name?

675
01:02:15.512 --> 01:02:16.912
It would be...

676
01:02:17.615 --> 01:02:19.242
if I were Christian.

677
01:02:20.050 --> 01:02:21.541
But I'm not.

678
01:02:23.286 --> 01:02:25.049
I was never baptized.

679
01:02:25.888 --> 01:02:27.583
I was a foundling.

680
01:02:30.057 --> 01:02:31.647
And so was Billy.

681
01:02:42.501 --> 01:02:45.693
We were raised in an orphanage outside of St. Louis.

682
01:02:47.238 --> 01:02:48.933
And he gave me my name.

683
01:02:49.941 --> 01:02:53.077
He saw it on a picture postcard from Scotland.

684
01:02:53.343 --> 01:02:58.139
It had a drawing on it, of a "bonny castle", it said.

685
01:02:59.482 --> 01:03:02.844
When we were 14, we ran away together.

686
01:03:03.884 --> 01:03:07.646
Like brother, sister, father, daughter, husband, wife.

687
01:03:08.488 --> 01:03:10.253
- He was my salvation.
- No.

688
01:03:11.826 --> 01:03:12.792
No.

689
01:03:15.028 --> 01:03:16.825
I don't want to know.

690
01:03:18.831 --> 01:03:19.891
Not now.

691
01:03:22.533 --> 01:03:26.726
You are Julia Russell from Wilmington, Delaware.

692
01:03:28.938 --> 01:03:30.565
You were born...

693
01:03:31.107 --> 01:03:33.537
the day you stepped off that boat...

694
01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:36.309
and became my wife.

695
01:03:41.015 --> 01:03:42.338
But then...

696
01:03:42.617 --> 01:03:45.480
then l am not Julia Russell at all, am l?

697
01:03:48.354 --> 01:03:50.187
I'm simply your wife.

698
01:04:42.966 --> 01:04:44.933
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

699
01:04:45.299 --> 01:04:47.426
It's Edwin, my dear.

700
01:04:47.868 --> 01:04:49.859
Am I too early?

701
01:04:50.705 --> 01:04:52.366
Don't hurry.

702
01:04:52.972 --> 01:04:58.105
Nothing gives me more pleasure than
to wait for you outside your door.

703
01:04:58.978 --> 01:05:02.407
Unless, of course, you were to let me in.

704
01:05:16.758 --> 01:05:19.192
- Colonel Worth.
- Good God!

705
01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:22.393
- May I help you, sir?
- You are not dressed, sir.

706
01:05:22.822 --> 01:05:24.194
No, I am not.

707
01:05:24.799 --> 01:05:27.733
I am engaged at the moment in a private function.

708
01:05:27.733 --> 01:05:31.235
A function for which clothes are more of a hindrance, not a help.

709
01:05:31.236 --> 01:05:32.430
A private function?

710
01:05:32.639 --> 01:05:33.628
Yes, sir.

711
01:05:33.839 --> 01:05:36.438
With Bonny? A private function?

712
01:05:36.507 --> 01:05:38.168
Good God, man!

713
01:05:38.408 --> 01:05:41.771
But I'm... I'm being rude. Please, please come in.

714
01:05:42.579 --> 01:05:44.137
No, sir. Are you mad?

715
01:05:44.213 --> 01:05:45.875
Mad? No.

716
01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:51.443
I am only curious to know what exactly is
your business at my wife's door.

717
01:05:55.090 --> 01:05:56.523
Your wife?

718
01:05:57.790 --> 01:05:59.281
Did you say, "wife"?

719
01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.728
Edwin, Edwin be careful.

720
01:06:01.928 --> 01:06:03.897
He has a fearful temper.

721
01:06:05.466 --> 01:06:07.524
I beg your pardon, sir. I do.

722
01:06:08.367 --> 01:06:10.028
I beg your pardon.

723
01:06:10.535 --> 01:06:12.365
I am an old fool.

724
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:14.531
I didn't know.

725
01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:18.031
I'm sorry.

726
01:06:25.047 --> 01:06:27.038
Good morning to you, sir.

727
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:29.337
Good morning.

728
01:06:29.609 --> 01:06:32.031
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

729
01:06:37.590 --> 01:06:38.651
You see?

730
01:06:40.458 --> 01:06:42.119
You have no past.

731
01:06:43.395 --> 01:06:45.727
It is gone. Finished.

732
01:06:46.396 --> 01:06:48.057
Disappeared.

733
01:06:50.566 --> 01:06:52.431
You have only me now.

734
01:07:12.227 --> 01:07:13.301
Morning.

735
01:07:13.352 --> 01:07:16.112
There you are. You weren't in your room this morning.

736
01:07:16.687 --> 01:07:19.189
I have some very interesting news.

737
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:20.680
So do l.

738
01:07:28.196 --> 01:07:29.857
"A woman's body found."

739
01:07:30.166 --> 01:07:32.857
"Foul play suspected."
How's my Spanish?

740
01:07:35.970 --> 01:07:37.360
Julia Russell?

741
01:07:38.839 --> 01:07:42.338
Stabbed in the neck with a small knife, then thrown overboard.

742
01:07:42.341 --> 01:07:45.874
Probably the work of a man, but could've easily been a woman.

743
01:07:45.878 --> 01:07:49.013
The blade of the knife was still in her throat.

744
01:07:50.881 --> 01:07:53.042
And so your wife...

745
01:07:53.519 --> 01:07:56.017
is now officially a fugitive.

746
01:07:56.186 --> 01:07:59.083
Not only you and l are pursuing her, but the police, as well.

747
01:08:00.191 --> 01:08:02.257
Cheer up now. This is good news.

748
01:08:02.257 --> 01:08:04.618
It won't be long now before she's caught.

749
01:08:05.494 --> 01:08:06.484
She...

750
01:08:07.163 --> 01:08:08.824
didn't do this.

751
01:08:12.666 --> 01:08:15.028
I believe you still love her, don't you?

752
01:08:19.038 --> 01:08:20.164
Of course.

753
01:08:20.687 --> 01:08:24.870
How could you hate her so much if you did not still love her?

754
01:08:27.077 --> 01:08:30.440
Trust me, my friend. There's no such thing as love.

755
01:08:30.581 --> 01:08:33.047
Or only misguided feelings and emotions.

756
01:08:33.182 --> 01:08:35.479
It was my knife. He used my knife.

757
01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:36.480
Yes, yes.

758
01:08:36.985 --> 01:08:40.450
- It wasn't me, I promise you.
- I believe you.

759
01:08:40.764 --> 01:08:43.191
No one else will never believe that I'm innocent.

760
01:08:43.191 --> 01:08:44.456
Listen to me.

761
01:08:44.525 --> 01:08:47.192
No one else matters. Not to me.

762
01:08:59.071 --> 01:09:00.732
What are you thinking?

763
01:09:02.107 --> 01:09:02.994
Of you.

764
01:09:11.113 --> 01:09:13.104
Welcome to Cardenas.

765
01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:17.751
Right this way. This is the entrance. It's very elegant...

766
01:09:18.252 --> 01:09:20.312
in a very good part of town.

767
01:09:20.753 --> 01:09:24.548
Mostly Americans and tourists from the Continent.

768
01:09:25.292 --> 01:09:29.655
I think you'll find all the furnishings you need included.

769
01:09:29.662 --> 01:09:31.288
a bedroom...

770
01:09:31.534 --> 01:09:34.460
a sitting room, a very good kitchen.

771
01:09:37.835 --> 01:09:41.197
Here in Cardenas, you are close to Havana...

772
01:09:41.370 --> 01:09:43.331
but very far away.

773
01:09:44.207 --> 01:09:49.042
We are known for the waters and for
the healing powers of the sun.

774
01:10:24.172 --> 01:10:25.367
Vargas.

775
01:10:27.342 --> 01:10:28.673
What a happy accident.

776
01:10:29.008 --> 01:10:30.839
Yes, yes indeed.

777
01:10:32.578 --> 01:10:34.569
What brings you to Cardenas?

778
01:10:35.113 --> 01:10:37.175
Not a rest cure, I assure you.

779
01:10:38.015 --> 01:10:40.006
No, of course not.

780
01:10:40.252 --> 01:10:43.811
There were reports of a woman answering a certain description.

781
01:10:43.811 --> 01:10:46.255
She was seen boarding a train heading East.

782
01:10:46.256 --> 01:10:50.023
You haven't seen or heard anything, have you?

783
01:10:50.592 --> 01:10:53.885
I've lost my taste for women of that description.

784
01:10:54.263 --> 01:10:55.954
Glad to hear of it.

785
01:10:58.667 --> 01:11:00.498
Listen...

786
01:11:01.802 --> 01:11:03.462
can I offer you a piñales?

787
01:11:03.670 --> 01:11:05.034
What's that?

788
01:11:05.471 --> 01:11:06.803
A drink.

789
01:11:07.353 --> 01:11:08.303
A drink.

790
01:11:08.573 --> 01:11:11.038
There's a cafe down the street.

791
01:11:15.313 --> 01:11:16.974
The sun is warm.

792
01:11:17.816 --> 01:11:20.744
Your face, for instance, is quite moist.

793
01:11:29.825 --> 01:11:34.017
The body was positively identified by her sister.

794
01:11:34.161 --> 01:11:36.994
Very sad, but very accurate.

795
01:11:37.329 --> 01:11:40.658
Two moles high on the inner thigh...

796
01:11:41.301 --> 01:11:43.697
and a gold crown on a back tooth.

797
01:11:43.697 --> 01:11:48.199
And on her left hand, a small, round scar.

798
01:11:48.841 --> 01:11:50.331
Very interesting.

799
01:11:52.596 --> 01:11:55.710
Will you excuse me? I have to use the convenience.

800
01:11:55.777 --> 01:11:57.438
By all means.

801
01:11:59.447 --> 01:12:01.109
Do as you must.

802
01:12:33.976 --> 01:12:35.307
Julia?

803
01:12:37.037 --> 01:12:38.236
Come here.

804
01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:40.971
Come upstairs. We...

805
01:12:42.983 --> 01:12:44.314
Ah, Luis.

806
01:12:45.752 --> 01:12:47.413
I am disappointed.

807
01:12:50.195 --> 01:12:52.919
And yet full of admiration.

808
01:12:56.861 --> 01:12:58.193
Where is she?

809
01:12:58.262 --> 01:12:59.594
Who? No.

810
01:12:59.930 --> 01:13:01.593
- She's not here.
- You called her name.

811
01:13:01.593 --> 01:13:03.624
Wait, wait. You have no business here.

812
01:13:03.667 --> 01:13:07.629
Downs, please. Be smart and leave. Get out while you still can.

813
01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:08.757
She's mine, Luis.

814
01:13:08.905 --> 01:13:11.163
Give her up, before it's too late.

815
01:13:11.605 --> 01:13:13.937
You are aiding a criminal!

816
01:13:14.508 --> 01:13:17.912
And you are very close to becoming a criminal yourself.

817
01:13:17.912 --> 01:13:19.606
Come to your senses, man.

818
01:13:20.113 --> 01:13:22.776
You saw it. She's not here. Now, please.

819
01:13:22.776 --> 01:13:23.449
Please.

820
01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:25.815
Don't lie to me, Mr. Vargas.

821
01:13:26.352 --> 01:13:28.183
I can smell her on you.

822
01:13:28.419 --> 01:13:32.111
Her perfume, stinking on your clothing.

823
01:13:32.458 --> 01:13:34.322
You just left her, didn't you?

824
01:13:34.391 --> 01:13:36.382
That's it. Get out.

825
01:13:38.627 --> 01:13:41.964
Did she throw her arms around you? Embrace you, like this?

826
01:13:41.964 --> 01:13:45.496
Did she rub her cheek against yours, like this?

827
01:13:45.634 --> 01:13:47.795
Did she kiss you on the mouth?

828
01:13:48.036 --> 01:13:51.068
If I kiss you now, will I taste her on you?

829
01:14:05.684 --> 01:14:07.412
You would do this for her?

830
01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:08.413
Luis!

831
01:14:09.453 --> 01:14:10.964
Wait! Wait.

832
01:14:11.087 --> 01:14:12.178
Wait.

833
01:14:13.422 --> 01:14:16.614
Speak of the devil, and she appears.

834
01:14:24.431 --> 01:14:26.592
My God. What have you done?

835
01:14:27.034 --> 01:14:28.867
- What have you done?
- It's...

836
01:14:28.868 --> 01:14:30.199
It's him.

837
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:32.866
It's the detective.

838
01:14:34.539 --> 01:14:36.100
He came here for you.

839
01:14:45.150 --> 01:14:47.215
What are you doing? Don't touch him.

840
01:14:47.215 --> 01:14:49.010
Don't touch him!

841
01:14:56.491 --> 01:14:59.318
- Did he come here alone?
- Yes.

842
01:14:59.459 --> 01:15:00.920
No one saw him come in?

843
01:15:01.021 --> 01:15:02.121
I... I... I...

844
01:15:02.795 --> 01:15:04.785
I... I don't know.

845
01:15:05.130 --> 01:15:07.121
Christ, Julia.

846
01:15:08.067 --> 01:15:09.400
I've killed a man.

847
01:15:09.967 --> 01:15:12.431
You need to go now, go to the train station.

848
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:16.196
Secure two seats on the morning train east, no matter where.

849
01:15:17.006 --> 01:15:17.997
And...

850
01:15:17.998 --> 01:15:21.843
I will contact the estate agent and tell him
that we've changed our minds...

851
01:15:21.843 --> 01:15:24.244
and there's been an emergency.

852
01:15:26.182 --> 01:15:27.512
Julia.

853
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:30.839
Yes, what?

854
01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:34.453
I've just killed a man.

855
01:15:36.255 --> 01:15:38.185
And I just bought a hat.

856
01:15:41.692 --> 01:15:47.030
But I don't dwell on it. I don't go around and saying
over and over in my head, "I just bought a hat."

857
01:15:47.031 --> 01:15:49.200
"I just bought a hat."
It doesn't matter.

858
01:15:49.266 --> 01:15:50.366
It doesn't matter.

859
01:15:51.534 --> 01:15:53.866
It's done. Help me.

860
01:15:55.637 --> 01:15:56.797
God.

861
01:16:08.482 --> 01:16:11.141
- That l should do it.
- I'll bring him down.

862
01:16:11.141 --> 01:16:11.983
No.

863
01:16:11.984 --> 01:16:14.845
No, you need to go to the station before the window closes.

864
01:16:16.187 --> 01:16:18.222
- Come here. Put these on.
- Yes, yes, yes.

865
01:16:18.222 --> 01:16:19.519
Yes, I'll hurry.

866
01:16:19.591 --> 01:16:21.218
No. No, don't hurry.

867
01:16:21.492 --> 01:16:25.093
Go slowly, enjoy the walk and no one notice you.

868
01:16:25.462 --> 01:16:26.983
- Understand?
- Yes.

869
01:16:26.983 --> 01:16:27.860
Good.

870
01:17:01.525 --> 01:17:02.855
Billy.

871
01:17:04.425 --> 01:17:06.218
You finally got what you deserved.

872
01:17:20.006 --> 01:17:22.407
- Jesus!
- Aren't you glad to see me?

873
01:17:22.407 --> 01:17:25.175
Aren't you glad to see old Detective Downs again?

874
01:17:25.177 --> 01:17:26.235
Should I be?

875
01:17:26.478 --> 01:17:29.779
I got very good notices playing this part in Chicago.

876
01:17:29.779 --> 01:17:31.212
Or don't you remember?

877
01:17:31.283 --> 01:17:33.113
Let go of me, Billy.

878
01:17:33.317 --> 01:17:35.648
You thought I was...

879
01:17:36.487 --> 01:17:38.147
really dead...

880
01:17:39.687 --> 01:17:40.985
didn't you?

881
01:17:52.164 --> 01:17:54.957
Did you think there were real bullets in that gun, huh?

882
01:17:55.299 --> 01:17:58.867
Did you think they were real the night
he came to murder you?

883
01:17:59.737 --> 01:18:04.531
I couldn't risk his putting out your lights,
not before I caught up with you.

884
01:18:05.507 --> 01:18:07.642
- Let go of me, Billy.
- Never.

885
01:18:07.677 --> 01:18:10.145
- Not untill you come back on the game.
- What game?

886
01:18:10.145 --> 01:18:12.280
The skin game, darling. Skin game.

887
01:18:12.281 --> 01:18:13.611
There is no game.

888
01:18:13.848 --> 01:18:15.611
Oh, yes. I see it so clearly.

889
01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:17.511
No, no.

890
01:18:18.352 --> 01:18:19.842
What do you see, huh?

891
01:18:22.021 --> 01:18:25.713
I see him running out of money. I see you arranging that.

892
01:18:25.858 --> 01:18:28.120
I see him doing the only thing he can do.

893
01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:32.028
I see him going to Santiago, selling his share of the company.

894
01:18:32.029 --> 01:18:34.530
I see him coming back with money.

895
01:18:34.530 --> 01:18:36.157
I see us...

896
01:18:36.367 --> 01:18:38.096
finishing what we started.

897
01:18:38.701 --> 01:18:40.101
You and me together.

898
01:18:40.236 --> 01:18:43.098
We're gonna make you a rich widow.

899
01:18:46.641 --> 01:18:47.597
No.

900
01:18:48.777 --> 01:18:52.280
He's worth a hell of a lot more than we
got out of him the first time, darling.

901
01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:56.037
And he's such an easy mark, devoted as he is to you.

902
01:18:56.382 --> 01:19:01.147
Bound together as you are by mutual crimes and various...

903
01:19:01.353 --> 01:19:02.843
misdemeanors.

904
01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:05.630
- Let go of me, please.
- Beg.

905
01:19:05.632 --> 01:19:06.300
Please.

906
01:19:06.301 --> 01:19:08.155
- Please, let go!
- Beg.

907
01:19:11.161 --> 01:19:14.693
It tickles my dick when you beg.

908
01:19:15.998 --> 01:19:18.489
He says he loves me.

909
01:19:21.503 --> 01:19:23.334
No one loves you, Bonny.

910
01:19:23.404 --> 01:19:24.962
No one could.

911
01:19:25.339 --> 01:19:26.829
Except for me.

912
01:19:28.674 --> 01:19:30.039
He does.

913
01:19:30.410 --> 01:19:31.810
I think he does.

914
01:19:31.945 --> 01:19:35.136
Not enough to live the life of a fugitive.

915
01:19:36.681 --> 01:19:39.013
Back alleys, cheap hotels....

916
01:19:39.251 --> 01:19:40.616
It won't be like that.

917
01:19:40.616 --> 01:19:42.646
Oh, how then? Happily ever after?

918
01:19:42.986 --> 01:19:45.954
A nice, respectable couple, living on Main Street?

919
01:19:45.955 --> 01:19:49.215
Sunday dinners, walks in the park with children?

920
01:19:50.192 --> 01:19:52.525
Christ, what's he done to you?

921
01:19:53.228 --> 01:19:55.252
Who do you think you are?

922
01:19:55.730 --> 01:19:57.789
Who does he think you are?

923
01:19:59.032 --> 01:20:01.023
You're a whore, Bonny.

924
01:20:01.301 --> 01:20:04.493
A man puts his hands on you, and you're wet.

925
01:20:06.305 --> 01:20:07.966
True or not?

926
01:20:11.911 --> 01:20:14.101
You were born one and you'll die one.

927
01:20:14.145 --> 01:20:17.006
Sooner or later if the police catch up with you.

928
01:20:19.917 --> 01:20:21.577
You wouldn't do that to me.

929
01:20:21.818 --> 01:20:25.352
I was your first man, Bonny. Your very first.

930
01:20:25.987 --> 01:20:27.753
And I will be...

931
01:20:28.023 --> 01:20:29.546
your last.

932
01:20:31.058 --> 01:20:32.889
One way or another.

933
01:20:35.628 --> 01:20:38.319
There's no future with him, darling.

934
01:20:38.965 --> 01:20:40.796
Face the truth.

935
01:20:41.633 --> 01:20:43.794
You can't live his life.

936
01:20:44.303 --> 01:20:45.770
And he certainly...

937
01:20:46.171 --> 01:20:47.898
can't live yours.

938
01:20:49.473 --> 01:20:50.964
Let him go.

939
01:20:53.911 --> 01:20:55.071
No.

940
01:20:55.245 --> 01:20:56.407
Let him go.

941
01:20:56.608 --> 01:20:57.508
No.

942
01:20:58.247 --> 01:20:59.736
Let him go.

943
01:21:06.937 --> 01:21:08.314
Yes.

944
01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:38.529
Julia?

945
01:21:41.310 --> 01:21:42.185
Julia?

946
01:21:48.788 --> 01:21:50.449
I was so hungry.

947
01:21:53.559 --> 01:21:54.861
What about him?

948
01:21:56.027 --> 01:21:58.718
- We have to get rid of the body.
- No, it's done.

949
01:22:00.030 --> 01:22:01.223
It's done?

950
01:22:04.165 --> 01:22:05.757
You mean you did it yourself?

951
01:22:06.668 --> 01:22:11.431
I packed all our things, as well.
I left one suit out on the bed, for the train.

952
01:22:12.073 --> 01:22:13.563
So did you get the tickets?

953
01:22:14.541 --> 01:22:16.710
- The tickets? Yes, yes.
- Good.

954
01:22:16.710 --> 01:22:18.609
We go tomorrow in the morning.

955
01:22:18.711 --> 01:22:20.839
Back to Havana. 7:00, yes.

956
01:22:23.316 --> 01:22:25.044
What an adventure.

957
01:22:28.153 --> 01:22:29.642
Come to bed.

958
01:22:30.887 --> 01:22:32.752
You must be exhausted.

959
01:22:33.188 --> 01:22:34.146
I know I am.

960
01:22:34.225 --> 01:22:36.756
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Yes?

961
01:22:37.226 --> 01:22:39.559
Have you no conscience at all?

962
01:22:40.063 --> 01:22:41.394
I mean...

963
01:22:42.730 --> 01:22:44.062
Yes, of course I do.

964
01:22:44.299 --> 01:22:47.931
But you see, I don't let it get the best of me.

965
01:22:48.834 --> 01:22:52.095
It's just something that happened. Something it had to be done.

966
01:22:52.739 --> 01:22:55.033
And when something has to be done, you do it, right?

967
01:22:55.034 --> 01:22:59.943
So, here's to us. A short life, but an exciting one.

968
01:23:04.683 --> 01:23:05.671
Good night.

969
01:23:10.853 --> 01:23:12.549
Listen to her talk.

970
01:23:13.021 --> 01:23:16.091
Listen to the words that came out of her mouth.

971
01:23:16.092 --> 01:23:17.581
You mean Bonny?

972
01:23:18.359 --> 01:23:19.850
Yes, Bonny.

973
01:23:22.596 --> 01:23:25.187
Did you have no control over her?

974
01:23:26.899 --> 01:23:29.200
No one had control over her.

975
01:23:29.935 --> 01:23:31.425
No one did.

976
01:23:34.374 --> 01:23:37.206
No one, except for Billy.

977
01:23:38.542 --> 01:23:41.073
And he wanted the rest of the money.

978
01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:47.571
They found a house in the poor section of town.

979
01:23:47.716 --> 01:23:51.580
Bonny said they would go unnoticed there, and she was right.

980
01:23:52.221 --> 01:23:55.512
There were many things that would go unnoticed in that house.

981
01:23:57.725 --> 01:24:00.559
All she had to do was get Luis to Santiago...

982
01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:03.788
and it would all be over.

983
01:24:10.168 --> 01:24:12.500
No, no, you don't understand.

984
01:24:13.836 --> 01:24:17.171
- We've run out?
- Yes, I'll go tomorrow to Santiago.

985
01:24:17.172 --> 01:24:19.873
I'll take the first train in the morning.

986
01:24:22.178 --> 01:24:23.906
What will you do there?

987
01:24:24.012 --> 01:24:26.173
We need money, don't we?

988
01:24:28.350 --> 01:24:30.180
Whatever you say.

989
01:24:41.625 --> 01:24:42.639
Julia?

990
01:24:46.364 --> 01:24:48.997
I don't want you to go to Santiago.

991
01:24:49.198 --> 01:24:50.498
But, but...

992
01:24:50.733 --> 01:24:51.791
I have to go.

993
01:24:51.923 --> 01:24:53.359
I don't want you to go.

994
01:24:53.702 --> 01:24:55.260
I have no choice.

995
01:24:56.371 --> 01:24:58.401
Yes, you do. You have a choice.

996
01:24:59.708 --> 01:25:01.173
Once again.

997
01:25:01.410 --> 01:25:04.236
- When my hand strays to my breast...
- Hearts.

998
01:25:04.378 --> 01:25:06.413
- My left eardrop.
- Diamonds.

999
01:25:06.413 --> 01:25:08.176
- My right eardrop.
- Clubs.

1000
01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:10.105
- My throat.
- Spades.

1001
01:25:10.382 --> 01:25:13.152
- Little finger of my left hand.
- One.

1002
01:25:13.152 --> 01:25:15.342
- Little finger of my right hand.
- Ten.

1003
01:25:15.753 --> 01:25:18.803
- When I do this, it means they have nothing.
- Right.

1004
01:25:21.559 --> 01:25:23.287
- King, queen, jack.
- Yes.

1005
01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:26.250
Yes.

1006
01:25:27.997 --> 01:25:29.157
Oh, you're a natural.

1007
01:25:29.198 --> 01:25:31.565
- But, listen to me...
- This is the way.

1008
01:25:31.566 --> 01:25:33.757
This is the only way. This is our way.

1009
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:36.731
This is you and me, together.

1010
01:25:38.906 --> 01:25:40.237
Please.

1011
01:25:43.509 --> 01:25:44.771
Now...

1012
01:25:45.344 --> 01:25:48.176
tell me what I'm holding.

1013
01:26:01.657 --> 01:26:03.848
Would you like some more whiskey?

1014
01:26:06.394 --> 01:26:07.554
Too rich for me.

1015
01:26:09.531 --> 01:26:11.692
Yes. Why not?

1016
01:26:12.865 --> 01:26:15.527
Why not, indeed? All right.

1017
01:26:17.204 --> 01:26:18.466
He wins again.

1018
01:26:19.038 --> 01:26:20.868
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

1019
01:26:21.372 --> 01:26:22.863
More champagne.

1020
01:26:27.878 --> 01:26:30.568
Does the lady mind if I remove my coat?

1021
01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:32.571
No, do and say as you please.

1022
01:26:32.950 --> 01:26:35.481
Try and forget that I am even here.

1023
01:26:35.485 --> 01:26:36.974
Easier said than done.

1024
01:26:42.324 --> 01:26:44.154
Can I get you another drink?

1025
01:27:17.518 --> 01:27:20.279
Will you ask the lady to retire, sir?

1026
01:27:22.923 --> 01:27:24.288
What do you mean?

1027
01:27:24.356 --> 01:27:25.756
Do you have to be told?

1028
01:27:26.958 --> 01:27:30.492
Take your hand from my wife. Please, sir.

1029
01:27:31.696 --> 01:27:32.788
Gladly.

1030
01:27:34.431 --> 01:27:37.867
If there is one thing lower than a man who cheated at cards...

1031
01:27:37.868 --> 01:27:41.504
it's a man who use a woman to do his cheating for him.

1032
01:28:15.664 --> 01:28:16.996
Julia?

1033
01:28:24.339 --> 01:28:25.670
Well, my dear...

1034
01:28:27.843 --> 01:28:31.204
let's see what other tricks you might know.

1035
01:28:58.966 --> 01:29:00.695
Are you all right?

1036
01:29:01.135 --> 01:29:02.294
Yes.

1037
01:29:03.303 --> 01:29:04.462
Should l...

1038
01:29:05.136 --> 01:29:07.469
Should I call someone?

1039
01:29:11.809 --> 01:29:13.470
You are so kind.

1040
01:29:15.981 --> 01:29:19.480
You are so young and innocent and kind.

1041
01:29:22.118 --> 01:29:23.311
No.

1042
01:29:24.252 --> 01:29:25.810
No one is innocent.

1043
01:29:31.993 --> 01:29:34.154
You have a story as well.

1044
01:29:36.262 --> 01:29:37.823
Will you tell me...

1045
01:29:39.499 --> 01:29:41.159
if there's time?

1046
01:29:43.334 --> 01:29:45.325
I have no story.

1047
01:29:46.671 --> 01:29:48.262
Not like yours.

1048
01:29:49.173 --> 01:29:52.036
Well, it was Bonny's story now.

1049
01:29:53.744 --> 01:29:55.708
and look what she had done.

1050
01:29:58.614 --> 01:30:00.952
He could not live in her world.

1051
01:30:01.450 --> 01:30:03.981
And she would never fit into his.

1052
01:30:57.929 --> 01:30:59.362
Dear Alan:

1053
01:30:59.929 --> 01:31:01.590
Congratulations.

1054
01:31:02.198 --> 01:31:07.391
You have just purchased my share of
Vargas-Jordan Coffee Export House.

1055
01:31:08.270 --> 01:31:12.132
The price I have settled on is everything that was in the safe...

1056
01:31:12.318 --> 01:31:16.807
which I believe is very much in your favor. I'm sorry.

1057
01:31:16.977 --> 01:31:18.467
Luis! Wait!

1058
01:31:18.611 --> 01:31:21.905
I'm sorry I couldn't wait to discuss this with you. But...

1059
01:31:22.781 --> 01:31:26.973
as you may know, I am now a fugitive from justice.

1060
01:31:27.118 --> 01:31:29.651
More than that, I cannot say.

1061
01:31:29.686 --> 01:31:31.577
What are you talking about?

1062
01:31:31.756 --> 01:31:33.044
- What have you...
- Murder.

1063
01:31:34.958 --> 01:31:36.549
I have done murder.

1064
01:31:37.294 --> 01:31:38.954
- No.
- Yes.

1065
01:31:39.295 --> 01:31:40.784
I did it for her.

1066
01:31:42.131 --> 01:31:43.792
And the truth is...

1067
01:31:44.631 --> 01:31:46.259
that I would do it again.

1068
01:31:50.304 --> 01:31:51.965
Good luck to you.

1069
01:31:52.305 --> 01:31:54.996
And thank you for having once been my friend.

1070
01:31:57.408 --> 01:31:58.739
Go on. Go on.

1071
01:32:05.349 --> 01:32:06.714
God help you.

1072
01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:06.851
Will you light me a cigar?

1073
01:34:08.383 --> 01:34:09.382
Yes.

1074
01:34:10.395 --> 01:34:12.194
I'll make us some coffee.

1075
01:34:20.436 --> 01:34:21.498
Damn!

1076
01:34:21.569 --> 01:34:23.705
- What happened?
- There's a rat.

1077
01:34:23.707 --> 01:34:26.966
- A rat?
- There's a rat. It ran right over my foot.

1078
01:34:28.309 --> 01:34:29.639
Do you see it?

1079
01:34:30.344 --> 01:34:31.333
No.

1080
01:34:36.750 --> 01:34:38.546
- I didn't see it.
- No?

1081
01:34:38.618 --> 01:34:39.949
What are you doing?

1082
01:34:40.152 --> 01:34:41.813
I'm going to the pharmacist.

1083
01:34:42.155 --> 01:34:43.951
- At this hour?
- Yes.

1084
01:34:44.189 --> 01:34:47.423
- It's 9.00. It's closed.
- No, there is one the private open till 10:00.

1085
01:34:47.424 --> 01:34:50.286
- Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait.
- I won't be long.

1086
01:36:46.787 --> 01:36:49.755
You can't save him, darling.
If that's what you're thinking.

1087
01:36:49.755 --> 01:36:52.418
Why not? Why can't we just go?

1088
01:36:53.459 --> 01:36:55.820
I have two tickets for us on the train.

1089
01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:58.488
Tonight, midnight. We have the money.

1090
01:36:58.864 --> 01:36:59.592
Leave him.

1091
01:36:59.664 --> 01:37:03.698
Oh, Bonny, it doesn't suit you, this kind of compassion.

1092
01:37:04.901 --> 01:37:09.036
How could I trust you?
There'd always be someone between us.

1093
01:37:09.105 --> 01:37:10.766
Why? Why hurt him?

1094
01:37:10.806 --> 01:37:13.197
He's a part of you that must die.

1095
01:37:13.276 --> 01:37:16.933
You need to kill it, or I promise you, it will kill you.

1096
01:37:18.012 --> 01:37:19.776
What are you doing? Billy?

1097
01:37:19.847 --> 01:37:23.349
I'm going back with you, to finish the job and have done with it.

1098
01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:26.582
- You'll have the police all over us.
- Then do as you're told.

1099
01:37:26.652 --> 01:37:28.015
Do it now.

1100
01:37:38.862 --> 01:37:40.262
- Say it.
- Billy...

1101
01:37:40.262 --> 01:37:42.361
- Say you're mine. You're mine. Say it.
- Billy, l can't.

1102
01:37:42.362 --> 01:37:44.297
- Yes, what?
- Yes, what?

1103
01:37:44.565 --> 01:37:46.396
Yes, I'm yours.

1104
01:38:29.436 --> 01:38:31.096
You startled me.

1105
01:38:32.505 --> 01:38:34.166
You took a long time.

1106
01:38:38.277 --> 01:38:40.308
What are you doing in the dark?

1107
01:38:40.345 --> 01:38:41.676
Thinking.

1108
01:38:42.312 --> 01:38:43.870
What are you thinking?

1109
01:38:45.950 --> 01:38:49.982
I was thinking that if I ever lost you, my life would be over.

1110
01:38:51.454 --> 01:38:53.986
There would be nothing left for me.

1111
01:38:55.055 --> 01:38:56.716
Except to die.

1112
01:39:00.461 --> 01:39:02.122
Don't say such things.

1113
01:39:03.965 --> 01:39:05.964
Did you find what you were looking for?

1114
01:39:05.964 --> 01:39:07.522
Yes, I did.

1115
01:39:08.267 --> 01:39:10.593
I had to go all the way across town.

1116
01:39:15.073 --> 01:39:16.904
I'm going to go change.

1117
01:39:29.051 --> 01:39:32.786
Wash your hands and go to bed. I'll bring the coffee.

1118
01:40:00.109 --> 01:40:01.542
There you are.

1119
01:40:16.954 --> 01:40:18.785
How do they die, do you think?

1120
01:40:22.460 --> 01:40:23.950
- From the poison?
- Yes.

1121
01:40:25.296 --> 01:40:26.627
I don't know.

1122
01:40:31.667 --> 01:40:33.658
lt's take a long time?

1123
01:40:36.404 --> 01:40:39.266
I suppose it depends on how much you give them.

1124
01:40:39.473 --> 01:40:41.134
That's right.

1125
01:40:44.144 --> 01:40:45.476
Is it painful?

1126
01:40:46.145 --> 01:40:48.778
I really don't want to think about it.

1127
01:40:51.249 --> 01:40:53.081
No, no, no, of course not.

1128
01:40:53.518 --> 01:40:58.245
We don't want our conscience to get the best of us, do we?

1129
01:41:00.357 --> 01:41:03.491
It's something that has to be done.

1130
01:41:04.195 --> 01:41:06.658
And when something has to be done...

1131
01:41:07.501 --> 01:41:09.020
you do it.

1132
01:41:09.530 --> 01:41:11.123
Is your coffee too hot?

1133
01:41:11.699 --> 01:41:13.030
I saw him.

1134
01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:17.801
Who?

1135
01:41:19.873 --> 01:41:21.363
I followed you.

1136
01:41:22.208 --> 01:41:23.606
You saw who? Where?

1137
01:41:24.876 --> 01:41:26.208
Julia.

1138
01:41:27.879 --> 01:41:30.248
Shall we... shall we just play the game...

1139
01:41:30.248 --> 01:41:32.546
or just speak the truth?

1140
01:41:34.317 --> 01:41:35.147
No.

1141
01:41:35.551 --> 01:41:37.042
The truth is best.

1142
01:41:37.387 --> 01:41:38.877
All right, then.

1143
01:41:40.989 --> 01:41:41.978
Is he here?

1144
01:41:43.992 --> 01:41:45.152
Yes.

1145
01:41:46.594 --> 01:41:47.754
Where?

1146
01:41:48.495 --> 01:41:51.529
Outside, waiting. When I turn the lights off.

1147
01:41:51.998 --> 01:41:53.489
When I am dead?

1148
01:41:55.668 --> 01:41:56.828
Yes.

1149
01:42:01.273 --> 01:42:03.702
I... I led him to you in Havana, didn't l?

1150
01:42:04.608 --> 01:42:05.598
Yes.

1151
01:42:07.011 --> 01:42:09.146
How'd he know I wouldn't kill you then?

1152
01:42:10.847 --> 01:42:13.707
He put blank cartridges in your gun.

1153
01:42:22.856 --> 01:42:24.188
Like a play.

1154
01:42:26.027 --> 01:42:27.358
All of it.

1155
01:42:29.696 --> 01:42:31.026
Lies.

1156
01:42:32.365 --> 01:42:34.299
From the moment I met you.

1157
01:42:35.366 --> 01:42:37.198
Not all of it, no.

1158
01:42:37.535 --> 01:42:40.966
Do you laugh at me behind my back, the two of you?

1159
01:42:43.307 --> 01:42:46.671
Do you laugh at me for how stupid I have been? How...

1160
01:42:48.644 --> 01:42:49.975
How blind?

1161
01:42:51.914 --> 01:42:53.142
No.

1162
01:42:54.448 --> 01:42:56.981
Laugh now when l tell you this.

1163
01:42:58.785 --> 01:43:00.116
l loved you, Julia.

1164
01:43:00.887 --> 01:43:03.419
Julia is not here. Julia is dead.

1165
01:43:04.290 --> 01:43:08.653
Laugh when l tell you that I still love you.

1166
01:43:09.028 --> 01:43:10.016
No.

1167
01:43:10.795 --> 01:43:12.261
No, not me.

1168
01:43:12.530 --> 01:43:13.827
You don't love me.

1169
01:43:14.131 --> 01:43:15.462
Oh, yes.

1170
01:43:16.633 --> 01:43:18.464
Oh, yes, you.

1171
01:43:19.803 --> 01:43:22.463
Not Julia Russell. Not...

1172
01:43:23.705 --> 01:43:25.294
Bonny Castle.

1173
01:43:26.574 --> 01:43:27.564
You.

1174
01:43:28.776 --> 01:43:30.807
l love you as I know you.

1175
01:43:31.278 --> 01:43:32.936
Because l know you.

1176
01:43:35.482 --> 01:43:36.813
As you are.

1177
01:43:38.818 --> 01:43:40.478
Good and bad.

1178
01:43:40.985 --> 01:43:42.749
Better and worse.

1179
01:43:46.257 --> 01:43:49.619
l told you this already, but you didn't believe me.

1180
01:43:51.662 --> 01:43:53.323
Tonight you will.

1181
01:43:55.599 --> 01:43:56.929
To us.

1182
01:43:59.366 --> 01:44:02.228
A short life and an exciting life.

1183
01:44:02.769 --> 01:44:04.431
Don't do this.

1184
01:44:05.605 --> 01:44:07.198
No other one.

1185
01:44:12.111 --> 01:44:14.271
No other love but you.

1186
01:44:18.782 --> 01:44:20.148
From first to last.

1187
01:44:22.952 --> 01:44:24.544
Start to finish.

1188
01:44:28.825 --> 01:44:31.856
Don't change, Julia. Don't ever change.

1189
01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:34.371
No, no, no.

1190
01:44:34.371 --> 01:44:35.371
No!

1191
01:45:00.917 --> 01:45:02.747
Let's go. You hold on.

1192
01:45:57.262 --> 01:45:58.592
Let's go.

1193
01:46:51.938 --> 01:46:53.462
You disappoint me, Bonny.

1194
01:46:58.644 --> 01:47:00.202
What do you think?

1195
01:47:00.279 --> 01:47:02.674
Do you think those are real bullets?

1196
01:47:21.425 --> 01:47:22.346
Do you speak English?

1197
01:47:22.349 --> 01:47:23.924
- Do you speak English?
- Yes!

1198
01:47:24.264 --> 01:47:25.664
He needs a doctor.

1199
01:47:25.799 --> 01:47:27.130
What about him?

1200
01:47:39.778 --> 01:47:42.109
He's dead. He needs a doctor.

1201
01:47:42.179 --> 01:47:45.314
All right. I'm calling the police.

1202
01:47:52.522 --> 01:47:55.048
Stay, stay, stay.

1203
01:47:55.124 --> 01:47:57.955
I love you.

1204
01:47:58.459 --> 01:48:01.652
I love you. I love you. I love you.
Do you hear me?

1205
01:48:01.859 --> 01:48:05.258
- Say it. Say it again.
- I love you. I love you. I love you.

1206
01:48:05.259 --> 01:48:07.330
I love you. I love you.

1207
01:48:07.533 --> 01:48:09.694
I love you, Luis.

1208
01:48:10.718 --> 01:48:14.947
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1209
01:48:15.106 --> 01:48:17.509
No. You hold on! Hold on!

1210
01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:18.510
No, no, no.

1211
01:48:20.243 --> 01:48:22.336
Don't go! Stay! Stay!

1212
01:48:22.579 --> 01:48:24.770
Please hold on.
Please hold on.

1213
01:48:43.628 --> 01:48:48.662
And this is where the story ends, at least for me.

1214
01:48:50.968 --> 01:48:53.129
Even though he is alive now...

1215
01:48:53.670 --> 01:48:55.602
how could I get to him?

1216
01:49:01.443 --> 01:49:03.275
Do you believe in forgiveness?

1217
01:49:05.712 --> 01:49:06.637
Yes.

1218
01:49:06.814 --> 01:49:09.538
And redemption for the human soul?

1219
01:49:18.456 --> 01:49:19.616
Yes.

1220
01:49:20.158 --> 01:49:22.149
Even for someone like me?

1221
01:49:24.628 --> 01:49:25.789
Yes.

1222
01:49:27.096 --> 01:49:28.587
I believe so.

1223
01:49:28.588 --> 01:49:29.588
Well then,

1224
01:49:30.100 --> 01:49:33.029
I will see him in heaven, won't l?

1225
01:49:40.875 --> 01:49:42.138
Yes.

1226
01:49:45.712 --> 01:49:47.747
Will you hand me my shawl, please?

1227
01:49:47.747 --> 01:49:48.805
Yes, of course.

1228
01:49:56.121 --> 01:49:58.452
Now pray with me.

1229
01:49:59.090 --> 01:50:00.078
Yes.

1230
01:50:03.928 --> 01:50:06.590
I wore this on my wedding day.

1231
01:50:07.896 --> 01:50:11.088
But my heart was not in it then.

1232
01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:04.903
I'm sorry, ma'am. It is time.

1233
01:51:16.318 --> 01:51:17.808
If I may?

1234
01:51:20.956 --> 01:51:22.616
What the hell!

1235
01:51:22.890 --> 01:51:25.853
- It's the priest.
- But he left an hour ago.

1236
01:51:25.858 --> 01:51:27.085
I saw him.

1237
01:51:27.661 --> 01:51:29.993
Guards!

1238
01:52:06.458 --> 01:52:11.653
Well, I must say, it is a pleasure to be in such
lovely company for a change.

1239
01:52:11.796 --> 01:52:13.956
Oh, the pleasure is all mine.

1240
01:52:14.298 --> 01:52:17.491
Thank you, gentlemen, for letting me attend.

1241
01:52:22.472 --> 01:52:26.937
And you, sir, may I say, it's a lucky man
who has found such a wife.

1242
01:52:29.811 --> 01:52:31.140
Yes, I am.

1243
01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:36.948
And perhaps, later on...

1244
01:52:37.016 --> 01:52:40.152
l will tell you the story of how we came to be here.

1245
01:52:40.652 --> 01:52:42.290
It is an...

1246
01:52:42.991 --> 01:52:45.247
interesting tale.

1247
01:52:45.823 --> 01:52:47.688
Some of it is even true.

1248
01:52:49.426 --> 01:52:51.757
But for now, all I can say...

1249
01:52:52.162 --> 01:52:54.693
is that from the moment I saw her...

1250
01:52:55.832 --> 01:52:57.230
l loved her.

1251
01:53:01.102 --> 01:53:03.263
And no matter the price...

1252
01:53:03.938 --> 01:53:06.798
you cannot walk away from love.

1253
01:53:10.509 --> 01:53:11.635
Four.
