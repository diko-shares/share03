NARRATOR: <i>The war</i>
<i>between sorcerers</i>

2
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.400
<i>was fought in</i>
<i>the shadows of history</i>

3
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.840
<i>and the fate of mankind</i>
<i>rested with the just</i>
<i>and powerful Merlin.</i>

4
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.040
<i>He taught</i>
<i>his secrets to three</i>
<i>trusted apprentices,</i>

5
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.440
<i>Balthazar, Veronica,</i>
<i>and Horvath.</i>

6
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.280
<i>He should have</i>
<i>trusted only two.</i>

7
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.720
<i>Veronica and Balthazar</i>
<i>witnessed the savagery</i>

8
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.000
<i>of a sorcerer</i>
<i>beyond evil,</i>

9
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.080
<i>Morgana le Fay,</i>
<i>Merlin's most deadly enemy.</i>

10
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.280
We are but servants.

11
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.920
Merlin.
Horvath!

12
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.920
You betray me?

13
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
(GASPS)

14
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.720
I am no one's servant.

15
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.520
Well done.
Now get the spell.

16
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.560
NARRATOR: <i>And so it was.</i>
<i>Morgana gained sorcery's</i>
<i>most dangerous spell</i>

17
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.080
<i>known as "The Rising,"</i>

18
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.280
<i>giving Morgana</i>
<i>the power to raise</i>
<i>an army of the dead</i>

19
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.960
<i>and enslave mankind.</i>

20
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.400
<i>Veronica sacrificed</i>
<i>herself for Balthazar</i>

21
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.800
<i>by drawing Morgana's soul</i>
<i>into her own body.</i>

22
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.280
<i>But Morgana</i>
<i>began to kill her</i>
<i>from the inside.</i>

23
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.000
<i>To save Veronica's life</i>
<i>and to capture Morgana,</i>

24
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.520
<i>Balthazar trapped them both</i>
<i>in the Grimhold,</i>

25
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.680
<i>an inescapable prison.</i>

26
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.800
<i>Over time, Balthazar</i>
<i>fought many sorcerers</i>

27
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.520
<i>who tried to</i>
<i>free Morgana,</i>

28
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.640
<i>trapping them in layer</i>
<i>upon layer of the doll.</i>

29
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.880
<i>Eventually, he captured</i>
<i>Horvath as well.</i>

30
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.720
<i>As Merlin lay dying,</i>
<i>he gave Balthazar</i>
<i>his dragon ring,</i>

31
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.280
<i>saying it would</i>
<i>guide him to the child</i>

32
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.360
<i>who would one day grow</i>
<i>to be Merlin's successor,</i>

33
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.280
<i>the Prime Merlinean.</i>

34
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.880
The Prime Merlinean
is the only one

35
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.200
who can kill Morgana.

36
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.520
NARRATOR: <i>Balthazar would</i>
<i>search for centuries.</i>

37
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.080
<i>And never, it is said,</i>
<i>will Balthazar waver</i>
<i>from his quest,</i>

38
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.080
<i>for mankind will</i>
<i>never be safe</i>

39
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.920
<i>until Morgana is destroyed</i>
<i>by the Prime Merlinean.</i>

Hey, Tank. How did you
even get up here?

42
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.520
DAVE'S MOM: David?
Field trip today.

43
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.800
Don't forget to wear
clean underwear.

44
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.880
She means me, not you.

(KIDS LAUGHING)

46
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.800
You're not supposed
to be doing that, Dave.

47
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.920
Now!

48
00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.680
BECKY: David.

49
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.640
That's cool.

50
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.760
...which means that
before Ellis Island

51
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.000
and the Statue of Liberty
were built...

52
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.120
DAVE: (WHISPERING)
Pass it to Becky.

53
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.120
OSCAR: Pass it on.
BOY: Pass it on.

54
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.600

Pass it to Becky.

55
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.000
GIRL 2: Here.

56
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.840
MS. ALGAR: Let's go.

57
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.680
Get on the ferry.
Get your bags.

58
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.400
Stay close.
Here we go.

59
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.080
Hey, stop!

60
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.800
Excuse me,
excuse me.

61
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.560
No!

62
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.400
No, lady, don't!

63
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.440
No way.

(EXCLAIMING)

65
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.960
The second emperor
of the Han dynasty

locked his
least-favorite wife in this
urn for 10 years to the day.

67
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.600
They say you open it up,
the same thing will
happen to you.

68
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.240
I'm sorry.
I'm looking for this note.

69
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.240
Have you seen it?
It kind of just
blew into your store.

70
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.160
A note?

71
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.760
It blew into your store.

72
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.760
(STAMMERING)
It was just a...

73
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.520
Coincidence.

74
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.200
Yeah, it was just
a coincidence.

75
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.520
I have something
I'd like to show you, Dave.

76
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.920
How'd you know
my name was Dave?

77
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.400
'Cause I can read minds!

78
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.560
It's on your backpack.

79
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.120
Come over here.

80
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.520
This is very special

81
00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.560
and if it likes you,
you can keep it.

82
00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.360
I better not.

83
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.200
My teacher said
I couldn't be
gone for long.

84
00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.440
She knows I'm here.

85
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.040
You're a bad liar, Dave.

86
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.040
That's good.

87
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.240
DAVE: Oh, boy.

88
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.800
No way.

89
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.240
I have been searching
a very long time.

90
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.880
Magically, here you are.

91
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.160
That ring on your finger
means something, Dave.

92
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.560
It means

93
00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.480
you're going to be
a very important
sorcerer one day.

94
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:04.200
And your first lesson
begins right now with
your very own Encantus.

95
00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.400
Do not move,
do not touch anything.

97
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.120
No way.

98
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.680
When am I?

99
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.680
New York City.

100
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.520
Not where. The year.

101
00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:40.320
You are wasting my time.

102
00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:49.600
What happened to
"don't touch anything"?

103
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.800
That's not very
sporting of you,
Balthazar.

104
00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:52.880
Be quiet.

105
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.880
It's not you.
He's been like this
for 1,000 years.

106
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.040
I'll explain later.

107
00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.960
I need the Grimhold.
Where's that doll?

There's these
crazy wizard guys
in there!

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.520
They're made of roaches!

116
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.320
No! Don't go in there!
The store's on fire!
Don't go in!

Those guys are

shouldn't tell stories.

Good morning.
What is that?
Oh, right.

127
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.680
Good morning, beautiful.

128
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.760
Hey, heads up.

129
00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:15.880
Oh.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.120
Happy birthday.

131
00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.240
Thank you, Bennet.

132
00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.640
You're up early.

133
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:27.640
Professor Heiderman wants
me to give a presentation
to his Physics 101 class.

134
00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.920
What? Teaching long division
to English majors?

135
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.880
I know.
It's like the Peace Corps,
but it's Heiderman's class.

Oh. So there's
smart cheerleaders.

140

So, seriously, you're
saying you don't want to
go out on your birthday?

Dave, are you familiar
with the gray wolf?

143
00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.120
Oh, no, please, Bennet.
Not this again with
the gray wolf. I can't...

144
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.640
The gray wolf
is a pack animal.

145
00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.440
He must find a mate.
He must hunt and grunt.

146
00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.280
He must participate.

147
00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.640
You're going to get
booted out of the pack!

148
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.040
Alone. Eaten
by a hungry bear.

That's a real
pick-me-up pep talk,

150

to go get the day.

DAVE: No, no.

152
00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.320
Oh, man.

153
00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.240
Everything okay
down there?

(STUTTERING)

155
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.800
I should just
leave, right?

156
00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.360
Right.

157
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.840
Wait. I'm sorry. Becky?

We were in
fourth grade together.

161

I do know you.
Dave Stutler.

162
00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.480
Right?
That's me.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.040
Yeah. You're that kid.

164
00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.640
What was that
place called?

165
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.760
Arcana...

166
00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:25.880
Arcana Cabana?

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.320
Yeah.

168
00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.320
So, did you transfer?

169
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.480
Yeah, I did.

170
00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:35.120
And got some help.
Treatment.

171
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.040
Yes, that was weird.

172
00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:42.080
You know what?
It turns out it's just
a glucose imbalance.

173
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.640
Hallucinations?

174
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.800
Not uncommon

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:20.160
And now I'm out.

530
00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.360
And I need soldiers.

531
00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:23.640
I got one kid.

532
00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:27.000
He ain't old school.

533
00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.800
One will do.

534
00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:32.160
Your ingenuity
and your heart

535
00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:35.240
will give you
an advantage
over Morganians.

536
00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:38.240
They rely only
on the power
of their magic.

537
00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.000
But if you're up
against the wall,

538
00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.360
there's only one
weapon of choice,

539
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.160
the plasma bolt.

540
00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:55.480
Nothing. There's nothing.

541
00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:59.400
I got it!
I got one!
I got one!

542
00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.080
That's underwhelming.

543
00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:05.840
God.

544
00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.400
Again.

545
00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.040
Ow! Ow! Ow!

546
00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.480
(READING)
...and invite my soul...

547
00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:19.720
And again.

548
00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.000
See? That's what
padding is for. Oh!

549
00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:35.040
DRAKE: So, out of a bath
full of jewels, I'm going
to emerge, right?

550
00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.720
And everyone's
going to think I'm me.

551
00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:40.400
I reach
into the big top hat
and I pull myself out,

552
00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.320
but I'm a woman.

553
00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:44.320
A ball of fire, right,

554
00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:47.000
a baby sitting in a nappy,
but I would like a tiger.

555
00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:50.240
If I could get, like,
a tiger jumping out
of a leopard.

556
00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:53.240
But not out of its mouth,
that's been done,
I'm sure, somewhere.

557
00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:58.120
Gorgeous.
Just perfect, darling.

558
00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:01.240
Yeah. Yeah, now,
keep it straight up
sinister.

559
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.280
Oh, do tell me
this is a joke.

560
00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.720
Sorry, are you lost?

561
00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:11.800
So, you're what passes
for a Morganian these days.

562
00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:16.800
Maxim Horvath!
You are one
smoking man of...

563
00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.440
Will you excuse us, ladies?

564
00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.560
Yes, excuse us, ladies.

565
00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:22.640
Bob.

566
00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:24.920
Bob.

567
00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.080
Sorry.

568
00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:32.040
So, they tell me
you're some kind
of entertainer.

569
00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.200
Five sold-out shows
at the Garden,

570
00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:36.280
plus back end on
the pay-per-view.

571
00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:41.280
Did you ever see Morgana
pull a rabbit out of a hat?

572
00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:44.840
Look, my master disappeared
when I was 15, vanished!

573
00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:46.560
Left me with nothing
but an Encantus

574
00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:49.280
and some
prescription-grade
abandonment issues.

575
00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:51.160
So I improvised.

576
00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:53.760
Well, the time for
improvisation is over.

577
00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:59.200
Balthazar Blake may have
found the Prime Merlinean.

578
00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:00.600
He wears the ring?

579
00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:01.880
Mmm.

580
00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:07.440
The best way to
defend against fire,

581
00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:11.000
vacuum sphere.

582
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Your turn.

583
00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.000
(GASPING)

584
00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:20.520
I did it!
I did it!

585
00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:23.000
Excellent.
Excellent.

586
00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.480
Excellent.
I just did that.

587
00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:29.840
What's wrong with
your Tesla coil?

588
00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:31.680
It seems to be
firing on its own.

589
00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:37.880
Really, really funny.

590
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.720
This will be
hilarious, then.
(CRACKLING)

591
00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.200
Oh, my God!

592
00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:47.480
Dude!

593
00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:51.240
Beg your pardon.
I haven't eaten
in 10 years.

594
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.600
Yeah. Yeah,
fair enough.

595
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.440
You mind if I ask
what's so special
about this bench?

596
00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.600
No, no, no.
What?

597
00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:05.040
There's no time for that,
and too much at stake.

598
00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:06.360
That girl,

599
00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.440
she's the one, man.

600
00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.160
And you're my mentor,
Balthazar.

601
00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:16.160
Aren't you supposed
to help me to achieve
my personal goals?

602
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.560
Yes! Yes! Except
I'm not your mentor.

603
00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:21.320
I'm your master.

604
00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:24.480
And your master says
if Horvath catches
you out on the street,

605
00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:25.880
you'll die.

606
00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:28.080
Is she worth that?

607
00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:30.240
Think about it, Dave.

608
00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:38.320
And don't eat
my sandwich.

609
00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:42.000
Becky! What a coincidence.

610
00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:43.800
BECKY: Oh, hey, Dave.

611
00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:45.000
Going uptown or...

612
00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:46.480
Are you stalking me?

613
00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:48.080
Not in a threatening way.

614
00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:50.400
Why was I even concerned?

615
00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:53.440
So I listened
to your show
last night.

616
00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:54.560
What did you think?

617
00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:55.680
It was amazing.

618
00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.520
I've never actually heard
of any of those bands,

619
00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:59.960
which I think is
a good indicator
that they're cool.

620
00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:01.400
(BECKY LAUGHING)

621
00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.760
I'm glad someone
was listening.

622
00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.880
This may come
as a surprise to you,
I don't get up to much.

623
00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.880
Give me the cash.
Give it. Come on.

624
00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.160
Give me the bracelet.
Okay, okay.

625
00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:12.680
Give me.
DAVE: Hey, hey, hey.

626
00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:14.120
(BECKY SCREAMING)

627
00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:17.680
That was my
grandmother's bracelet.

628
00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:22.440
No! Dave, don't!

629
00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:36.120
You just give me that
bracelet back, please.

630
00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:38.120
You better run back
to your girlfriend.

631
00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:41.440
Believe me,
I wish she was...

632
00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:43.680
You thought she was
my girlfriend?

633
00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:46.480
Really? Is that
the kind of vibe
you got?

634
00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.720
You talk too much.
Shut up.

635
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:53.440
What are you doing?

636
00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:56.280
I have no idea what
you're referring to.
I honestly...

637
00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:00.080
Whoa!

638
00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:01.920
You seeing this?
Heads up.

639
00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:08.240
COP: Up the stairs!

640
00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:10.080
Are you okay?

641
00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.360
Yeah. Here you go.

642
00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:13.440
Your grandmother's
bracelet.

643
00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:16.680
How did you do that?
That guy was huge.

644
00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:20.680
I've been doing a lot
of cardio boxing lately.

645
00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:24.440
Let me introduce
Thunder, Lightning.

646
00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:30.240
Something about you
seems different.

647
00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:33.200
I'm wearing new shoes.

648
00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.120
Nice.

649
00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:38.000
Thank you.
This your train?

650
00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:41.240
Yes. Thank you.

651
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.680
I just want
to tell you that

652
00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:46.040
if you want me
to help you with
your midterms,

653
00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:47.280
come by my lab.

654
00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:48.400
I'll text you
the address.

655
00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:50.040
Yes, yes,
that would be great.

656
00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.960
Yeah?
Tomorrow?

657
00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:53.200
It's a date.

658
00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:56.480
No, no, no.
It's not a date!

659
00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.800
It's a date
like an appointment.

660
00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:02.040
No. A date like
an appointment!

661
00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:13.400
Love is a distraction.

662
00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:16.800
Sorcery requires
complete focus.

663
00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:20.880
Let's go,
Thunder and Lightning.
There's more to learn.

664
00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:27.280
This is perfect.

665
00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:30.040
The Rising will happen here.

666
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:33.920
We'll use their
satellite dishes
on the rooftops.

667
00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:39.000
There, and there,
and there.

668
00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.600
Get it done.

669
00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:44.080
My "Best of" DVD
drops next month.

670
00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:47.920
Here we go.
All right. Move.

671
00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:51.520
Sorry about that.

672
00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:54.000
It's just nice for them to
see a genuine icon like me.

673
00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:57.440
Fortunately,
they'll all be dead soon.

674
00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:00.960
And before that,
we need to find the boy.

675
00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.440
Well, how do we do that?

676
00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:07.200
We'll wait
until he's alone.

677
00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:12.880
Now, focus on control.

678
00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:14.560
Set me down
slow and steady.

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:20.880
Dave? It's Becky.

681
00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:24.040
I'll be back shortly.

682
00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.760
Could you please hide?
Hide now. Please.

683
00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:28.640
Dave, get back here.

684
00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:30.040
We have important
work to do.

BECKY: Knock, knock.
Yeah.

686
00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:34.720
Hi.
Hi.

687
00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.160
We should go.
A library, anyplace...

688
00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:38.320
BALTHAZAR: Dave?

689
00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:41.880
Is that company I hear?

690
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.880
Yeah. Okay. Fine.
Becky, this is my...

691
00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.320
Uncle. Uncle Balthazar.

692
00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:51.160
Hey, Dave,
I'm confused.

693
00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:53.480
I thought you and I were
staying in together.

694
00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:55.160
If this is a bad time,

695
00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:56.920
I can come back.
Yes, actually.

696
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.040
No. No.

697
00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:01.600
Uncle, you and I have
plans for later on.

698
00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:03.760
Becky, let's just
get out of here.

699
00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:06.200
You know what?
It's all right,
because I just remembered

700
00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:09.360
I have to go
into town to pick up
your anti-itch cream.

701
00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:12.360
So, you two stay here.
Pleasure to meet you.

702
00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:04.680
DAVE: Okay, enough
with the studying.

703
00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:06.360
There's something

01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:42.080
Hello, Balthazar.

1054
01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:44.480
Oh, man. Oh, man.

1055
01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:46.200
No, no, no.
Back up. Back up.
Back up. Back up.

1056
01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:48.200
Back up. Back up.
Back up. Back up.

1057
01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:51.440
Oh, man.

1058
01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:54.080
I've got an idea.
I've got an idea.

1059
01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:56.160
Dave, don't.
Please just let me do it.

1060
01:15:58.880 --> 01:15:59.920
What?

1061
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.760
'73 Pinto?
This is your idea?

1062
01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:05.560
No! No. My idea
was to turn their
car into a beater.

1064
01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:14.560
Finish it.
Right!

(EXCLAIMING)

1066
01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:25.720
I think he stopped.

1067
01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:40.720
DAVE: Hold on, Tank.
Hold on, Tank.
I got you, buddy.

1068
01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:42.360
MAN: ...walked away.

1069
01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.240
Hey!

1070
01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:05.440
I'm sorry. I thought
you were someone else.

1071
01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:10.680
Where's Horvath?

1072
01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.560
Did he get away?

1073
01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:15.280
Where's the Grimhold?
Who was that?

1074
01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:19.120
That was her, wasn't it?

1075
01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:21.640
The third apprentice.

1076
01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:28.880
For centuries,
Veronica, Horvath and I
were the only thing standing

1077
01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:31.560
between Morgana
and man's destruction.

1078
01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:34.280
Our friendship
and our magic

1079
01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:36.240
were what Veronica
and I depended on.

1080
01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:39.480
You fell for her,
didn't you?

1081
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.520
I fell for her.

1082
01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:49.520
<i>Like you, all Veronica</i>
<i>wanted was to be normal.</i>

1083
01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:53.520
<i>Normal things,</i>
<i>normal life.</i>

1084
01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:56.880
<i>I fell.</i>

1085
01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:01.280
And so did Horvath.

1086
01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:05.840
That's why Horvath
betrayed us.

1087
01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:08.160
For 1,000 years,

1088
01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:10.520
you've been carrying her
around with you.

1089
01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:12.520
In the Grimhold.

1090
01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:16.720
I was going to
give this to her
that night.

1091
01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:26.720
I'm sorry.

1092
01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:31.440
Okay, Balthazar.

1093
01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:36.160
We are going to
get Veronica out
and destroy Morgana.

1094
01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:39.720
What's happened to you?

1095
01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:41.200
Nothing.

1096
01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:42.920
You're still
a bad liar.

1097
01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:44.480
Why does everyone...

1098
01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:46.960
You know,
I am glad she likes you.

1099
01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:50.160
No, I am not surprised.
Only glad.

1100
01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:53.520
There's nothing
like it, is there?

1101
01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:59.520
Put your old man
shoes back on.

1102
01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:01.560
We have some work to do.

1103
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.400
HORVATH: Are all
the satellite dishes
in position?

1104
01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:08.560
All lined up.

1105
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.000
I chipped my mani,
which is not cool.

1106
01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.960
No, I imagine it's not.

1107
01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:18.120
Inside there lies
our next coworker.

1108
01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:22.560
Abigail Williams,
a little witch who
put Salem on the map.

1109
01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:25.800
Once she's out,
we're at the
Morgana shell.

1110
01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:29.520
Now that's going to
take a lot of time
and energy to crack.

1111
01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:31.120
So what are we
going to do?

1112
01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:33.400
Have you heard of
the Parasite Spell?

1113
01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:35.120
(CHUCKLING)

1114
01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:38.880
Sorry, I forgot
your education's
somewhat lacking.

1115
01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:41.360
Yeah, I prefer to go
more by instinct.

1116
01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:43.320
You know,
what feels right.

1117
01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:45.920
Very good. Well,
the Parasite Spell

1118
01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.840
is a rather nasty
piece of business.

1119
01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:51.760
It originated in Haiti,
if memory serves.

1120
01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:56.320
It enables one sorcerer
to steal the energy
from another.

1122

Excuse me?

1125
01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:18.600
I'd like to
make a request.

<i>I just finished my show.</i>
<i>But maybe next time, okay?</i>

1127

I said I'd like
to make a request.

1128
01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:39.680
BALTHAZAR: All right.

1129
01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:45.000
When Morgana is released,
no matter what happens,

1130
01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:49.320
promise me you'll do
whatever it takes
to destroy her.

1131
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.000
I promise.

1132
01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:56.520
And for the record,
you wear the old
guy shoes very well.

disagree with you,
but thank you.

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:07.080
Might as well.

1136
01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:10.840
Now that I have
kidnapped the girl
for you,

1137
01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:13.120
is it time to
release Morgana?

1138
01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.320
I'll give her
your regards.

1139
01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:18.960
Mr. Horvath,
have I done
something wrong?

1140

1141

HORVATH: Not at all.

1142

I need your power
to free Morgana.
I just don't need you.

1143
01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:30.920
Well, that's two.

1144
01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:32.800
One more to go.

1145
01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:45.880
That's horrifying.

ground up into chunks
and fed to the cat

Merlin's ring
and the Grimhold.

It's been a while
since I've been
this close to it.

1170
01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:17.720
I wonder if
it still works.

1171

You all right?

1172
01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:26.240

1175
01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:42.360
He took my ring.

1176
01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:45.240
He was gonna kill Becky.

1177
01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:48.240
I'm so sorry, Balthazar.

1178

the same thing, Dave.

Horvath's going
to release Morgana.

Well, you can't
take him on and Morgana
at the same time. That's...

1223
01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:13.400
but they make him
a better conductor.

Dave, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1225
01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:20.000
All right, Rebecca,
here it is.

1226
01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:24.280
Many evil sorcerers
will be raised from
the dead tonight.

1227
01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:28.920
So, basically, Morgana
is trying to destroy
the world as we know it.

1228
01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:31.360
Oh, just that.

1229
01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:35.200
This is really dangerous.
I can't bring you into it.

1230
01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:38.400
Well, I think
I'm already into it.

1231
01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:42.960
And besides,
if you blow it, we're all
gonna die anyway, right?

1232
01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:45.360
I want to come with you.

1233
01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:48.600
You're sexy.

I got all the
Tesla coil remotes.

1235
01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:54.720
Thanks, brother.
I appreciate it.

1236
01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:57.280
Oh! I found this
after we hung up.

1237
01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:00.080
It was on the desk.

"Give this to Veronica.
Balthazar."

1239
01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:13.280
I don't think
Balthazar's planning
on coming back.

01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:17.960
I don't know what
you're into here, Dave,

1241
01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:22.880
but whatever it is,
you are definitely
participating!

I appreciate that.
We should go.

It's me, Horvath.
Morgana.

No need to look
so pathetic.

1248
01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.080
Destroy that thing.

1249
01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:30.360
I never want
to see it again.

1250
01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:36.040

you honestly don't

No. See what?

the satellite dishes on

to do me a favor.

I need you to go up
to the very top

Great.

1262

You got to move that antenna
and just disrupt the signal.

Okay. Right.

I never saw
what you checked,

1268
01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:47.440
so in case I die tonight,
could you please tell me?

1269
01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:50.360
Don't die
and I'll tell you.
