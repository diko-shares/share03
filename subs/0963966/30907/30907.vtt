00:00:03,736 --> 00:00:06,304
No! No, no, no! No, please!

2
00:00:06,338 --> 00:00:08,541
Please! Please! No!

3
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:11,109
Burn her! Burn her!

4
00:00:11,143 --> 00:00:13,646
No! You know me!

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,315
I am a God-fearing woman!

6
00:00:16,347 --> 00:00:18,451
Burn the witch!

7
00:00:18,484 --> 00:00:20,620
No! Please!

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,509
Please!

9
00:00:21,608 --> 00:00:22,803
Abigail Goodwin!

10
00:00:22,903 --> 00:00:24,272
No, please!

11
00:00:24,594 --> 00:00:27,548
Having been found guilty
of consorting with Lucifer,

12
00:00:27,997 --> 00:00:31,392
you are hereby sentenced
to baptism by fire.

13
00:00:31,444 --> 00:00:32,945
No. No, no, no.

14
00:00:32,946 --> 00:00:34,418
No, I know not the Devil.

15
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,624
'Tw-'Twas sickness took my husband!

16
00:00:36,624 --> 00:00:38,660
Burn the witch! Burn her!

17
00:00:38,693 --> 00:00:40,462
No, I beg thee!

18
00:00:40,495 --> 00:00:41,764
Have mercy!

19
00:00:41,797 --> 00:00:43,098
No!

20
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,100
Who will take care of my daughter?

21
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:48,736
Burn her! Burn!

22
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,672
You will burn.

23
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:55,578
Lord, Lord, have mercy on my soul!

24
00:01:06,288 --> 00:01:09,158
Abigail.

25
00:01:09,191 --> 00:01:11,260
Abigail.

26
00:01:11,292 --> 00:01:13,663
Abigail.

27
00:01:22,304 --> 00:01:23,973
Abigail!

28
00:01:24,006 --> 00:01:25,206
No! No!

00:01:50,205 --> 00:01:51,183
Good riddance.

31
00:01:53,768 --> 00:01:55,637
Oh, no.

32
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,940
You're moving out?

33
00:01:57,973 --> 00:01:59,173
No.

34
00:02:00,011 --> 00:02:01,996
I mean, you can if you want to, yes,

35
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,722
but some things are gonna
change around here.

36
00:02:03,822 --> 00:02:07,125
I am talking "Wizard of Oz" wallpaper.

37
00:02:07,158 --> 00:02:09,226
Sweetheart, I'm not moving.

38
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,862
I'm just boxing this stuff up

39
00:02:10,894 --> 00:02:12,897
and taking them to the
attic, that's all.

40
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:14,332
What about the curse?

41
00:02:14,364 --> 00:02:16,267
Ar... Aren't you gonna need
the books and Mom's weapons

42
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:17,590
to fight all the demons?

43
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,660
As a matter of fact, I will not.

44
00:02:22,894 --> 00:02:23,840
Do you, uh...

45
00:02:26,754 --> 00:02:28,264
Do you know who this is?

46
00:02:28,554 --> 00:02:29,734
Bobby Orr.

47
00:02:29,768 --> 00:02:31,304
That's right.

48
00:02:31,336 --> 00:02:33,673
I direct your attention to his head.

49
00:02:33,978 --> 00:02:36,582
Notice the boyish thatch
of chestnut-brown hair,

50
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,616
which is unadorned by a helmet.

51
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,285
Nowadays, helmets are mandatory.

52
00:02:40,317 --> 00:02:42,987
They won't even let you
on the ice without a helmet.

53
00:02:43,027 --> 00:02:46,474
But for Bobby, no helmet, no nothing...

54
00:02:46,474 --> 00:02:49,577
just his roguish charm
and his skilled stickwork.

55
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,547
And I know...
I-I know what you're thinking.

56
00:02:52,942 --> 00:02:55,011
How did his head not get pulverized

57
00:02:55,043 --> 00:02:57,346
by a puck traveling 90 miles an hour?

58
00:02:58,735 --> 00:03:00,703
Because he didn't believe
it would happen,

59
00:03:00,737 --> 00:03:03,040
so it never did.

60
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,716
And that's what I'm doing from now on.

61
00:03:05,742 --> 00:03:08,913
Bobby Orr's helmet... you don't
believe you'll need it...

62
00:03:12,331 --> 00:03:13,487
you never will.

63
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,620
So what are you putting in here?

64
00:03:17,654 --> 00:03:19,590
My hockey memorabilia.

65
00:03:19,623 --> 00:03:23,893
This is going to be my own
personal hockey museum.

66
00:03:23,927 --> 00:03:25,828
The pièce de résistance is...

67
00:03:25,862 --> 00:03:27,398
Bobby Orr's helmet.

68
00:03:28,277 --> 00:03:28,866
No.

69
00:03:29,457 --> 00:03:33,062
That... That was the whole
point of my lovely story.

70
00:03:33,094 --> 00:03:35,163
Th-There... There is no helmet.

71
00:03:35,474 --> 00:03:37,889
Yeah, but... the way you
were talking about it,

72
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:40,392
it just sounded like
the perfect thing to have.

73
00:03:40,425 --> 00:03:42,461
Right, but how... how...
how could I have it

74
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:44,364
if... if it doesn't exist?

75
00:03:44,396 --> 00:03:46,432
That... That goes directly against

76
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:48,268
the whole Bobby Orr's theory.

77
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,770
However, what I do have
is one of Bobby's sticks.

78
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:54,841
It was chucked into the crowd
after a game-winning goal

79
00:03:54,873 --> 00:03:56,341
with no time left on the clock

80
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,711
against the Detroit Red Wings in 1972.

81
00:03:58,745 --> 00:04:00,346
It is

82
00:04:00,378 --> 00:04:02,081
it is my prized possession

83
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:04,580
and the last remaining source of joy

84
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,183
that I have on this planet.

85
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:08,374
Oh.

86
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:11,620
Give or take.

87
00:04:13,356 --> 00:04:16,558
Well... if it was in
the attic, it's gone.

88
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:19,161
Mom donated everything to the church.

89
00:04:21,096 --> 00:04:22,364
What?

90
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:24,904
See? Ta-da!

91
00:04:26,903 --> 00:04:28,371
Dad?

92
00:04:29,204 --> 00:04:30,906
I got to go back to the church.

93
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,177
Like, right now, or in life?

94
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,039
Come on!

95
00:04:46,307 --> 00:04:47,342
May I help you?

96
00:04:48,532 --> 00:04:49,610
Who the hell are you?

97
00:04:49,643 --> 00:04:50,911
I beg your pardon?

98
00:04:50,944 --> 00:04:52,245
Where's Father Mike?

99
00:04:52,278 --> 00:04:53,680
Oh, he's on sabbatical.

100
00:04:53,713 --> 00:04:54,749
Went to Wisconsin to visit his dear...

101
00:04:54,782 --> 00:04:56,184
Now, listen, you.

102
00:04:56,216 --> 00:04:58,318
You got something of
mine and I want it back.

103
00:04:58,352 --> 00:05:00,788
My wife, God rest her soul...

104
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:03,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

105
00:05:03,124 --> 00:05:05,760
before she was stolen
from me by your boss,

106
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:07,961
she accidentally donated
my hockey collection

107
00:05:07,994 --> 00:05:09,062
to your church.

108
00:05:09,095 --> 00:05:10,297
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah.

109
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:11,932
And a remarkable collection it is, too.

110
00:05:11,965 --> 00:05:13,300
As a matter of fact,
Father Michael blessed it

111
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,802
just before he left.

112
00:05:14,835 --> 00:05:17,246
Yeah. Well, that's
Father Mike up and down.

113
00:05:17,294 --> 00:05:18,862
Christ sake, that guy'd fart in the tub

114
00:05:18,895 --> 00:05:20,264
and bless the bubbles.

115
00:05:20,297 --> 00:05:22,366
I say God helps those
who helps themselves.

116
00:05:22,968 --> 00:05:25,267
But son of a bitch,
God didn't have to help himself

117
00:05:25,302 --> 00:05:26,970
to my hockey memorabilia.

118
00:05:27,003 --> 00:05:28,572
Now go ahead. Go get it!

119
00:05:28,605 --> 00:05:30,907
I'm sorry. It doesn't work that way.

120
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:35,330
Listen, you. My wife made a mistake.

121
00:05:36,345 --> 00:05:39,316
She gave you something of
mine and I want it back.

122
00:05:39,348 --> 00:05:40,483
Now go ahead and go get it.

123
00:05:40,516 --> 00:05:41,984
That's the law.

124
00:05:42,018 --> 00:05:44,321
- It is?
- It is.

125
00:05:44,495 --> 00:05:46,397
Mr. Miller, I don't want
to have to call the sheriff.

126
00:05:46,398 --> 00:05:48,173
Ah! I am the sh...

127
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,146
Oh, son of a bitch!

128
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,040
Oh, I'm going to a concert
tonight, so I got to leave early.

129
00:06:03,073 --> 00:06:05,075
No, your shift ends at 8:00 p.m.

130
00:06:05,107 --> 00:06:07,210
Yeah. That's why I said
I'm leaving early.

131
00:06:07,244 --> 00:06:11,148
Tonight at the Garden...
the surviving Bee Gees.

132
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:13,517
I think there's two of 'em.

133
00:06:13,549 --> 00:06:15,585
Guess I wasn't aware
you were into disco.

134
00:06:15,619 --> 00:06:16,919
I'm not.

135
00:06:16,953 --> 00:06:18,355
But I am into aging party chicks

136
00:06:18,388 --> 00:06:20,323
- trying to relive their glory days.
- Oh.

137
00:06:20,357 --> 00:06:22,960
Maybe they'll come down with
a little "Saturday Night Fever"

138
00:06:22,992 --> 00:06:24,528
and Dr. Leon will have
to take their temp

139
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:26,627
with his disco thermometer.

140
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,232
That's implying I'd go home
with them and have sex.

141
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:30,333
Get out.

142
00:06:34,651 --> 00:06:36,273
Willard's Mill Sheriff's Department,

143
00:06:36,306 --> 00:06:38,355
cursed since 1693.

144
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:41,278
Oh, Sheriff Miller... he retired.

145
00:06:42,257 --> 00:06:43,007
Oh, really?

146
00:06:43,873 --> 00:06:44,647
Wow.

147
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:50,036
Stan's about to assault a priest.

148
00:06:51,046 --> 00:06:52,216
Have fun with that.

149
00:06:54,431 --> 00:06:55,582
Pew!

150
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:06,008
Pew.

151
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:16,999
I had no knowledge of this contribution.

152
00:07:17,368 --> 00:07:18,837
Nothing! You weren't here.

153
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,539
Mike was here.

154
00:07:20,572 --> 00:07:24,243
I'm surprised he ever
accepted this to begin with.

155
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:26,511
This is my blood. You've taken my blood.

156
00:07:26,543 --> 00:07:28,981
- You're familiar with...
- What's going on?

157
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:31,483
This knob won't give me
back my hockey stick.

158
00:07:31,515 --> 00:07:32,617
What?!

159
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:33,986
His late wife donated something

160
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:36,321
for our charity auction,
and I'm of the belief

161
00:07:36,353 --> 00:07:38,589
that we should honor
the wishes of the departed.

162
00:07:38,623 --> 00:07:41,692
My wife is dead! I am alive!

163
00:07:41,726 --> 00:07:44,563
Alive beats dead every time!

164
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:45,384
Listen, you.

165
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:50,301
He has my Bobby Orr stick.

166
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:51,469
Who's Bobby Orr?

167
00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:56,742
Did you just say, "Who's Bobby Orr?"

168
00:07:56,774 --> 00:08:00,003
Did... Did you actually
just say that to my face?

169
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:04,575
The Boston Bruins. Bobby Orr.

170
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,754
He scored 139 goals in 1971.

171
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:12,337
The only defenseman
to ever win a scoring title.

172
00:08:13,724 --> 00:08:16,460
He changed hockey, Barret.

173
00:08:16,493 --> 00:08:21,065
Number 4, Bobby Orr!

174
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:22,933
- Number 4...
- Stan...

175
00:08:22,966 --> 00:08:24,969
- last week...
- Bobby Orr!

176
00:08:25,002 --> 00:08:26,738
- You and I found out that we share...
- Number 4...

177
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,073
a 400-year-old curse

178
00:08:29,106 --> 00:08:30,646
and you shrugged it off.

179
00:08:30,646 --> 00:08:32,882
But this... this is...
this upsets you, a stick?

180
00:08:32,915 --> 00:08:34,285
Okay.

181
00:08:34,318 --> 00:08:37,500
He was born in Parry Sound, Ontario,

182
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,737
just a wee lad with nothing more
than his skates and a dream.

183
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,106
And then came the ice of winter.

184
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,379
Go home.

185
00:08:45,142 --> 00:08:47,011
Look, kid, no disrespect,

186
00:08:47,044 --> 00:08:48,579
but if this mackerel snapper
thinks he can take...

187
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:50,401
Go home!

188
00:08:51,314 --> 00:08:54,017
I will get your stupid little stick if,

189
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,219
and only if, you go home right now.

190
00:08:56,252 --> 00:08:58,321
Not another word!

191
00:08:58,354 --> 00:09:00,190
Mush, little husky, mush!

192
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,928
Hi.

193
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:13,503
You're new in town.

194
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:15,272
Yeah. Um, wow.

195
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,306
Believe it or not, that's...

196
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,175
that's actually my predecessor.

197
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:20,743
He's a very spirited man.

198
00:09:20,776 --> 00:09:22,812
Ooh. And then some.

199
00:09:22,845 --> 00:09:26,315
Look is there any way...

200
00:09:26,349 --> 00:09:28,618
- He can have the stick.
- Really?

201
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,720
It's with the other auction
items in the basement.

202
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:32,489
- Please.
- Oh, great. Thank you.

203
00:09:34,557 --> 00:09:36,059
Thank you.

204
00:10:01,151 --> 00:10:02,786
Jesus.

205
00:10:03,732 --> 00:10:04,620
I see.

206
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:09,158
Sorry.

207
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,394
Dee-aye rey-oos nah-thrak.

208
00:10:11,427 --> 00:10:13,329
Father Donovan.

209
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:16,566
Die-mas be-thed nah-thrak.

210
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,701
Dee-aye rey-oos nah-thrak.

211
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:26,310
Die-mas be-thed nah-thrak.

212
00:10:26,343 --> 00:10:29,847
Dee-aye rey-oos nah-thrak.

213
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:34,884
Evelyn.

214
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:38,187
Evelyn.

215
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,656
Evelyn.

216
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,725
- Evelyn.
- Stan?!

217
00:10:42,758 --> 00:10:45,863
- Evelyn.
- Anybody?!

218
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:49,366
Evelyn.

219
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,634
Evelyn.

220
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:54,470
Evelyn.

221
00:10:58,642 --> 00:10:59,851
Hmm.

222
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,795
Willard's Mill Sheriff's Department.

223
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:05,916
Please whisper.

224
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:07,584
Leon, put that woman on the phone.

225
00:11:07,617 --> 00:11:10,420
Evie isn't here. I just got in.

226
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:12,756
I met this woman at a show last night.

227
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:16,077
Did y'ever meet a lady
who's, like, just laughing

228
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:18,295
and then she starts crying,

229
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:20,397
but then she goes back to laughing?

230
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,832
And then she starts crying?

231
00:11:21,864 --> 00:11:24,200
Leon, where's my stick?

232
00:11:24,233 --> 00:11:26,235
Can you describe it?

233
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,240
It's a stick! It's a wooden stick!

234
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,344
Okay. I'll get right on it.

235
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:37,414
Goddamn donkey.

236
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,885
There's nowhere to run, Evelyn.

237
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,821
There's no place to go.

238
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:47,590
Miss Barret, is that you?

239
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,258
K-Karen?

240
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,394
Don't be mad.

241
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:53,829
Karen, what is this?

242
00:11:53,863 --> 00:11:55,332
Don't be mad, okay?

243
00:11:57,934 --> 00:12:00,603
There's no point in running.

244
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,373
- There's no place to go.
- No! No!

245
00:12:03,406 --> 00:12:04,775
No! Please.

246
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,275
No!

247
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,212
Where the hell am I?!

248
00:12:08,244 --> 00:12:10,580
Please! I have to get back!

249
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:12,548
I have a daughter!

250
00:12:31,173 --> 00:12:33,283
All right, here's the plan, sweetheart.

251
00:12:33,283 --> 00:12:35,411
You go get Donovan
to take your confession

252
00:12:35,443 --> 00:12:36,753
and once you get him in there,

253
00:12:36,786 --> 00:12:39,209
man, you take the largest guilt dump

254
00:12:39,272 --> 00:12:41,174
in the history of confession.

255
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,709
Most important thing is,

256
00:12:42,742 --> 00:12:45,883
you got to keep him busy
while I'm looking for my stick.

257
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:49,350
What do I have to confess, though?

258
00:12:49,382 --> 00:12:50,650
I-I haven't done anything.

259
00:12:50,684 --> 00:12:52,352
Well, I don't know.

260
00:12:52,386 --> 00:12:53,788
Make pretend you're Whitey Bulger.

261
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,522
I-I don't like Whitey Bulger.

262
00:12:55,555 --> 00:12:57,424
Why can't I be somebody cool?

263
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,060
Like... Jesse James?

264
00:13:01,729 --> 00:13:03,165
Jesse James was a...

265
00:13:05,481 --> 00:13:08,384
- Yes. Yes.
- Oh.

266
00:13:08,401 --> 00:13:10,691
- Why, that's a terrific idea.
- Yeah.

267
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:13,650
Just make sure you killed
one hell of a lot of people

268
00:13:13,651 --> 00:13:15,843
and you feel just terrible about it.

269
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:18,813
Aw. Yee-haw!

270
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:20,283
Yee-haw.

271
00:13:22,505 --> 00:13:25,016
Shut the God... Oh, forget.

272
00:13:25,017 --> 00:13:27,911
I-I-I'll just press the
automatic shut-the-door button.

273
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,785
Oh, that's right. There's no such thing!

274
00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:36,531
Love of God.

275
00:13:36,564 --> 00:13:40,201
Who are you? What is this place?

276
00:13:40,757 --> 00:13:42,495
My name is Abigail Goodwin.

277
00:13:43,592 --> 00:13:47,397
This... is the space between spaces...

278
00:13:47,431 --> 00:13:49,833
the realm between the land of the living

279
00:13:49,865 --> 00:13:51,634
and the realm of the dead.

280
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:53,570
How do I get out?

281
00:13:53,603 --> 00:13:56,073
There is but one way.

282
00:13:56,105 --> 00:13:57,640
It is the Master

283
00:13:57,673 --> 00:13:59,776
who keeps us here trapped in this place

284
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:02,780
before summoning a demon from the pit

285
00:14:02,812 --> 00:14:05,381
and binding it to our very souls.

286
00:14:05,414 --> 00:14:07,583
Yeah.

287
00:14:07,624 --> 00:14:09,927
I should be writing this down.

288
00:14:10,815 --> 00:14:13,319
What did you mean about the...
the binding of the souls?

289
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:13,940
Sorry.

290
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,078
The Master needs us
to give form to his minions.

291
00:14:17,111 --> 00:14:19,581
That is our only escape.

292
00:14:19,613 --> 00:14:20,212
Uh...

293
00:14:21,848 --> 00:14:23,717
Why are you helping me?

294
00:14:23,751 --> 00:14:26,154
'Cause I was once a mother.

295
00:14:28,638 --> 00:14:29,833
So, there I was,

296
00:14:29,865 --> 00:14:31,734
in the Dodge City Saloon,

297
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,800
one eye on the door,
one eye on my cards.

298
00:14:35,564 --> 00:14:37,533
I'm holding three aces.

299
00:14:37,565 --> 00:14:41,670
I play it cool, but not too cool.

300
00:14:41,703 --> 00:14:43,907
And in walks none other...

301
00:14:45,241 --> 00:14:48,111
than Tall Man McGee.

302
00:14:48,144 --> 00:14:50,113
Our brother who sent you to us,

303
00:14:50,145 --> 00:14:52,615
he has taken on the guise of a Catholic.

304
00:14:52,647 --> 00:14:54,483
Father Donovan?

305
00:14:54,516 --> 00:14:57,520
A shepherd bearing
only his rod and staff

306
00:14:57,553 --> 00:14:59,722
- confronted the demon.
- Mm-hmm?

307
00:14:59,755 --> 00:15:01,691
He pierced its heart
with his wooden rod.

308
00:15:01,723 --> 00:15:03,325
Okay?

309
00:15:03,358 --> 00:15:07,162
If your companion can defeat the demon

310
00:15:07,195 --> 00:15:10,799
in this manner before it banishes him,

311
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:13,269
then you will be set free.

312
00:15:13,302 --> 00:15:17,707
Uh, we're not really like a
rod-and-staff kind of culture any...

313
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,842
anymore, though.

314
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:24,480
Okay.

315
00:15:24,512 --> 00:15:26,715
All right, where are you?

316
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:33,043
If I were a priest hiding a stick,

317
00:15:33,956 --> 00:15:35,758
where would I...

318
00:15:37,492 --> 00:15:38,489
Oh.

319
00:15:40,496 --> 00:15:43,399
There you are, my precious.

320
00:15:45,467 --> 00:15:48,871
Holy shit. Father Mike.

321
00:15:48,904 --> 00:15:50,706
So, I says,

322
00:15:50,738 --> 00:15:53,275
"What's the matter, McGee? You scared?"

323
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:56,344
And he says, "Yes," and starts crying.

324
00:15:56,377 --> 00:15:57,946
Well, then, of course I start crying,

325
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,750
and now we're both
standing there sobbing.

326
00:16:00,783 --> 00:16:02,518
You okay over there?

327
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,107
You're awfully quiet.

328
00:16:04,852 --> 00:16:08,924
Dee-aye rey-oos nah-thrak.

329
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,660
Die-mas be-thed nah-thrak.

330
00:16:13,495 --> 00:16:15,398
Dad, you in there?

331
00:16:20,336 --> 00:16:21,365
You in there?

332
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:25,707
Dad? Oh.

333
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:31,448
Ow! Ah!

334
00:16:31,503 --> 00:16:33,605
Young lady, are you all right?

335
00:16:36,106 --> 00:16:38,742
There is no one downstairs, child.

336
00:16:38,776 --> 00:16:40,210
Bring her outside.

337
00:16:40,243 --> 00:16:41,612
Oh. Okay.

338
00:16:50,054 --> 00:16:53,233
So, they start singing,
"How Deep Is Your Love."

339
00:16:53,234 --> 00:16:54,768
And this chick turns to me and says,

340
00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:57,204
"How deep is your love?"

341
00:16:57,236 --> 00:16:58,704
And, you know, I'm like,

342
00:16:58,738 --> 00:17:00,739
"You wanna go out by
the Dumpsters and find out?"

343
00:17:00,773 --> 00:17:02,576
And she's like,
"That's not what I meant."

344
00:17:02,608 --> 00:17:04,410
And I'm like, "What... What...
What did you possibly mean?"

345
00:17:04,443 --> 00:17:06,312
And she's like, "Forget it."
And I'm like, "No, seriously?

346
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:07,980
What else could you possibly mean?"

347
00:17:09,382 --> 00:17:11,985
Oh, wait, hold on.

348
00:17:12,018 --> 00:17:13,353
Yep?

349
00:17:13,385 --> 00:17:14,720
I need you to get down to St. Agnes

350
00:17:14,754 --> 00:17:15,922
and bring your shotgun.

351
00:17:15,954 --> 00:17:17,356
We got to kill the new priest.

352
00:17:20,793 --> 00:17:21,995
Yes!

353
00:17:22,028 --> 00:17:23,729
Wait, is this about your stick again?

354
00:17:23,762 --> 00:17:25,464
Do you trust me, Leon?

355
00:17:25,498 --> 00:17:27,734
No. But I'm afraid of you.

356
00:17:27,767 --> 00:17:29,436
That's just as good. Five minutes.

357
00:17:35,842 --> 00:17:38,612
Oh, jalapeño, baby.

358
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:41,234
What was that?

359
00:17:41,235 --> 00:17:42,870
They found us.

360
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:48,739
Hey, padre.

361
00:17:50,411 --> 00:17:52,414
Now, you're gonna tell me where Evie is,

362
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:56,317
or I'm gonna rip you open
like a bag of Pop-Tarts.

363
00:18:00,254 --> 00:18:03,190
You like that, don't you?

364
00:18:03,796 --> 00:18:04,905
Oh, shit!

365
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,506
Oh, no.

366
00:18:19,651 --> 00:18:20,819
What is that?

367
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:23,004
Our souls are about to be bound.

368
00:18:23,037 --> 00:18:24,506
I'm so sorry.

369
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:26,807
And here, I thought things
were looking up for us.

370
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:31,011
Dee-aye rey-oos nah-thrak.

371
00:18:31,045 --> 00:18:34,215
Dee-aye rey-oos nah-thrak.

372
00:18:34,248 --> 00:18:37,184
Dee-aye rey-oos nah-thrak!

373
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,095
Backup has arrived!

374
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:55,236
Oh, Constable, hear me!

375
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,204
You must pierce the demon in the heart

376
00:18:57,238 --> 00:18:58,774
with a wooden staff!

377
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:05,112
Aah!

378
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,882
You're going to explode.

379
00:19:07,949 --> 00:19:09,083
Yeah.

380
00:19:10,451 --> 00:19:13,421
Abigail.

381
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:15,823
Abigail.

382
00:19:15,856 --> 00:19:17,925
Evelyn.

383
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:22,063
Oh! God! Oh!

384
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:29,037
Called it.

385
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:31,716
Huh.

386
00:19:45,653 --> 00:19:49,289
You sacrificed your Bobby
Orr stick to save me.

387
00:19:49,323 --> 00:19:53,628
Hey. Good.

388
00:19:53,661 --> 00:19:55,964
I'm glad that...

389
00:19:55,997 --> 00:19:59,567
you know, you're not...

390
00:20:01,168 --> 00:20:02,370
Yeah.

391
00:20:03,371 --> 00:20:05,172
Sure.

392
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:07,474
Hey, um...

393
00:20:07,508 --> 00:20:09,410
you too.

394
00:20:10,598 --> 00:20:12,412
Yeah.

395
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:15,115
Number 4, Bobby Orr.

396
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:18,286
Number 4, Bobby Orr.

397
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:19,988
Bobby Orr.

398
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,422
God.

399
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:35,708
Rest in peace, hallowed defender.

400
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:39,144
Rest in peace.

401
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:41,650
Sorry, Stan.

402
00:20:43,232 --> 00:20:45,402
Yeah, they just don't make 'em
like Bobby anymore.

403
00:20:45,975 --> 00:20:47,002
Only player to win

404
00:20:47,036 --> 00:20:49,372
three consecutive Hart
Trophies for league MVP.

405
00:20:53,475 --> 00:20:55,433
You were messing with me?

406
00:20:56,145 --> 00:20:58,248
I'm from Belmont, ya knob.

407
00:20:59,268 --> 00:21:00,077
Oh.

408
00:21:21,503 --> 00:21:26,376
Bobby Orr! Number 4, Bobby Orr!

409
00:21:26,408 --> 00:21:30,347
Number 4, Bobby Orr!
