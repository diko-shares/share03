00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,480
<i>of the lore introduced in 2014's
"Man of Steel."</i>

177
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,220
And the amazing thing to me as a fan

178
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,630
<i>is that even though this franchise</i>

179
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,180
<i>has been going on for 80 years,</i>

180
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,750
<i>the world of Krypton is so rich</i>

181
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,520
that there's really no end
to the creative

182
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,920
<i>and storytelling possibilities.</i>

183
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,010
<i>There's a lot of characters
that have been introduced</i>

184
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,930
from 1938 to now,

185
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,489
<i>and a lot of them have been forgotten,</i>

186
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,210
<i>but there's a reason why
Superman still persists.</i>

187
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,950
Superman was created out of nothing.

188
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,450
There were no superheroes.

189
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,070
<i>There was just Jerry Siegel
and Joe Shuster</i>

190
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,490
<i>in Cleveland, Ohio,</i>

191
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,469
<i>creating an alien character
called Superman.</i>

192
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,580
In 1938, in short,
the world had never been

193
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:23,579
<i>a scarier or more unjust place.</i>

194
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,579
<i>And at that time,
the world's first superhero</i>

195
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,110
<i>appeared on bookshelves.</i>

196
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,729
<i>I don't think it's a coincidence</i>

197
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,499
that this guy became popular.

198
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,400
<i>♪ ♪</i>

199
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,539
He's always that shining
beacon of goodness and courage.

200
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,409
Truth, justice, and the American way...

201
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,579
<i>I mean, these are,
like, spiritual ideas.</i>

202
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,449
<i>These are ideas you can build
a religion around.</i>

203
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,120
Here we have an alien
among us in Superman

204
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,180
<i>who represents the highest
and best qualities</i>

205
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,389
<i>of what we like to think of as humanity.</i>

206
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,189
Why has Superman endured for so long?

207
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,590
It's because those themes are undying,

208
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,900
<i>and so is he.</i>

209
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,569
Superman has been through
just about everything

210
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,869
<i>you can think of... 52 universes,</i>

211
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,809
<i>evil versions of himself,
bizarro versions of himself.</i>

212
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,670
<i>He died, very famously.</i>

213
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,800
Superman kind of is so well known

214
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,110
and so well documented... in animation,

215
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,509
<i>in film, in television,</i>

216
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,780
<i>in comics.</i>

217
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,120
First connection I had
to Superman growing up

218
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,439
<i>was the day I read
my first "Superman" comic.</i>

219
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,100
<i>It kind of taught you</i>

220
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,539
<i>you could do almost anything you wanted.</i>

221
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,400
<i>If he could, why couldn't I?</i>

222
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,540
My very first connection
was the Max and Dave Fleischer

223
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,040
<i>"Superman" cartoons</i>

224
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,710
<i>that I saw when I was very, very young.</i>

225
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,030
They were done on a really
elaborate scale for cartoons.

226
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,850
<i>They were very realistic
and very cinematic.</i>

227
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,589
I am and always will be a fan

228
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,329
of the original TV series,
"Adventures of Superman,"

229
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,960
<i>with George Reeves, 'cause that's what</i>

230
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,140
<i>I grew up with as a kid.</i>

231
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,629
Your aim is bad, Luigi.

232
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,629
The first Superman movie
with Christopher Reeve

233
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:56,369
<i>really embraced
the Superman I grew up with.</i>

234
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,940
<i>I read the script, and quite honestly,</i>

235
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,709
<i>it was missing the humanity,</i>

236
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:04,340
<i>its sense of reality.</i>

237
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,220
<i>I decided to do it
if they'd let me do a rewrite,</i>

238
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,750
and the reason I would do it
was to protect Superman.

239
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,630
<i>It played a huge part
in my imaginative life.</i>

240
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,300
I actually have a scar
on my chin right here.

241
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,459
<i>I jumped off the couch with a cape</i>

242
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,329
<i>that said "Superkid" on it,</i>

243
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,459
and I fell on my face.

244
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,799
For me, I grew up in the time
of the great "Animated Series."

245
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,369
<i>I'm a huge "Animated Series" fan.</i>

246
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,160
I really like the Bruce Timm
designs of Superman.

247
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,570
<i>Those angular characters
are, I think, very unique.</i>

248
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,479
One of the things
that we decided to do early on

249
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,809
<i>both to humanize Superman and also</i>

250
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,260
<i>to kind of make the stories
a little bit more interesting</i>

251
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,240
<i>is we did make him
a little bit more vulnerable.</i>

252
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,489
I love the "Smallville"
version of Superman.

253
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,360
<i>I think Tom Welling
did a really good job</i>

254
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,919
<i>portraying Superman's innocence</i>

255
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,090
and the tension in him.

256
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,429
I think every major creator
at some point

257
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,399
<i>wants to tackle
and tell a Superman story.</i>

258
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,499
It's an American fable.
It's American history.

259
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,569
<i>Everybody wants to take a crack at it.</i>

260
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,069
<i>As a Superman fan,</i>

261
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,870
there's no greater feeling

262
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,039
<i>than getting the chance to contribute</i>

263
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,509
<i>something, anything, to the legacy
of the character.</i>

264
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,479
You know you're standing
on the shoulders of giants

265
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,649
<i>that preceded you, so there is</i>

266
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,619
<i>pressure to get it right
and to tell a great story.</i>

267
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,220
<i>Once you open the comics,</i>

268
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,859
you realize how deep
the storytelling is,

269
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,859
<i>how much of it is based on</i>

270
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,400
<i>the connections between people.</i>

271
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,729
I think the greatest
Superman moment of all time

272
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,529
<i>is five panels in Grant Morrison's</i>

273
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,660
<i>"All-Star Superman."</i>

274
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,469
<i>There is a woman on a ledge</i>

275
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,699
<i>who's about to step off,
and a strong voice</i>

276
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,799
<i>behind her says,</i>

277
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,669
<i>"You are so much stronger
than you think you are."</i>

278
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,770
<i>At heart, they are</i>

279
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,779
really sort of simple stories.

280
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,150
<i>You know, Superman is
the immigrant that comes here</i>

281
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,779
<i>and sees the best in us.</i>

282
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,579
Different writers bring their passions,

283
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,749
<i>and, as you go through the decades,</i>

284
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:56,450
<i>you see different social
justice issues being raised.</i>

285
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,559
A good writer is looking
at everything around him

286
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,129
<i>and looks at society and sees,
"What can you address?"</i>

287
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,160
<i>We live in a society now where truth,</i>

288
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,660
<i>justice, and the American way,</i>

289
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,729
these ideas are actually under siege.

290
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,360
<i>Looking at the world we live in</i>

291
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,630
<i>and Superman's place in it,</i>

292
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,439
<i>you realize that he's exactly</i>

293
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,009
<i>the hero we need right now.</i>

294
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,609
Boy, do we need Superman.

295
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,940
<i>The great thing about
the Superman universe</i>

296
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,220
<i>is the breadth of it.</i>

297
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,849
Because Superman is
a science fiction character,

298
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,060
<i>ultimately, the whole universe is open,</i>

299
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,589
<i>so he's connected to things
across time travel,</i>

300
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,600
<i>the future, the past,
through space travel,</i>

301
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:33,059
<i>as well as to Earth and Krypton.</i>

302
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,420
<i>Well, I think it's gonna be
really interesting to see</i>

303
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,160
the backstory of Superman's family.

304
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,180
I mean, we basically know the story

305
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,589
<i>of Superman's parents fairly well,</i>

306
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,750
<i>but the idea that there
are family histories</i>

307
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,300
<i>that extend beyond that I think is one</i>

308
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,259
<i>that's rich for development.</i>

<i>It's one of the most special places

it's here in this room.

326
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,350
We have the most important
comic book ever made.

327
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,959
It's this one right here.

328
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,659
It's "Action Comics" #1.

329
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,899
It's the landmark issue

330
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,829
which creates the genre of superheroes

331
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,310
by having Superman in it.

332
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,519
<i>It is the birth
of the golden age of comics,</i>

333
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,259
<i>and that's where Krypton starts,</i>

334
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,320
<i>when the rocket ship takes off.</i>

335
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,129
Everyone that's kind of
touched Superman,

336
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,700
from the radio play to the movies

337
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,640

338
00:12:56,641 --> 00:12:58,550
<i>has added to his mythology</i>

339
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,580
<i>and expanded what he can do.</i>

340
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,710
All of superheroes come from this comic.

341
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,379
So this is the first panel ever.

342
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,179
So as a lifelong fan,
holding onto this comic book

343
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,750
means everything to me.

344
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,150
He's the kind of character

345
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,559
that, the more you dig into him,

346
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,720
<i>the more you're impressed</i>

347
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,689
<i>that he's doing what he does</i>

348
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,759
<i>and the way he does what he does.</i>

349
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,329
Some of my favorite versions
of Krypton really imagine it

350
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,730
as a place that I think
that was like us.

351
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,100
<i>No matter how kind of wondrous
civilization gets,</i>

352
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,669
<i>you realize that they still have</i>

353
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,209
some of the same
kind of deep-rooted conflicts

354
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,740
that we have now.

355
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,110
<i>It seems to me like they had, you know,</i>

356
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,840
the idea of Krypton,
and Superman comes from him,

357
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,959
but it wasn't until a little bit later,

358
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,220
they actually came back to it.

359
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,800
<i>I mean, it's such a fertile ground</i>

360
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,149
<i>for really rich stories,
and you can't start the story</i>

361
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,169
<i>without all of this.</i>

362
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,470
And actually, I believe
I have a map of Krypton

363
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,510
in case you get lost.

364
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,569
I don't know what it looks like

365
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,280

366
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,510
The Volcano of Gold.

367
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,500
And I could tell you right now,

368
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,990
some of these places
feature in the show.

369
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,270
I'm not gonna tell you which ones.

370
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,680
- That's fantastic.
- You have to watch.

371
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,300
<i>The great thing about Superman</i>

372
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,519
<i>is that it's got a mythological basis</i>

373
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,220
that everybody knows, and, from that,

374
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,859
you can tell a variety of stories.

375
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,590
It's fascinating how
the first interpretations

376
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,410
of Superman were a much more
rough-and-tumble hero.

377
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,560
<i>- Yeah.
- And he wasn't necessarily</i>

378
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,570
<i>going after mad scientists.</i>

379
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:15,330
<i>He was much more street justice.</i>

380
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,469
<i>- Right.
- Which is something</i>

381
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,680
<i>we've brought to our show.</i>

382
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,969
<i>The mythology has expanded so much,</i>

383
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,470
<i>and for us, as well,
it's a science fiction show,</i>

384
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,009
<i>so it all has to make sense.</i>

385
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,040
This is "Action Comics" 236 to 247,

386
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,120
and it's here
for a very important reason.

387
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,980
- Brainiac.
- Brainiac.

388
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,049
<i>Brainiac is this thing that comes here</i>

389
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,919
<i>and then captures us and says,</i>

390
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,619
"You're just this tiny, small thing,

391
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,989
<i>"and you're never going to be important,</i>

392
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,000
<i>"you're never going to be big,</i>

393
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,390
<i>and so let me bottle you up
and take you away."</i>

394
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,420
Brainiac's history
was already tied to Krypton

395
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,740
<i>even before Superman came to Earth.</i>

396
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,480
<i>Famously, Brainiac came
to Krypton in the past</i>

397
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,230
<i>and devastated Kandor.</i>

398
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,919
<i>He stole the entire city
and shrunk it down</i>

399
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,260
<i>into this globe on his ship,</i>

400
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,440
and so it made absolute sense

401
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,940
that he would be our big bad.

402
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,449
One of my favorite
interpretations of Brainiac

403
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:06,090
throughout the years is the run
that Geoff and Gary Frank did

404
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,580
<i>with incredible art</i>

405
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,000
<i>and really, in a way, brought Brainiac</i>

406
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,839
<i>back into Superman continuity
and made him who he is,</i>

407
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,669
<i>this incredible green being.</i>

408
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,740
And it's interesting to me as well,

409
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,139
the way Brainiac has always
been used as well

410
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,279
<i>is for a way for Superman to reexamine</i>

411
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,660
<i>what it means to be human.</i>

412
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,220
Gary Frank, the artist, and I

413
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,219
<i>really decided to take a run
at making him threatening</i>

414
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,880
<i>in a, I guess, more horrific way</i>

415
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,000
<i>and would go around to these places</i>

416
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,289
<i>and digitize cultures and destroy it</i>

417
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,589
<i>and just collect it,
and that version of Brainiac</i>

418
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:37,490
did heavily influence
what we're doing in the show.

419
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,799

Here we are in one of

423
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,570
There's "Showcase" #17. Adam Strange.

424
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,300
Adam Strange was really
the closest thing we had

425
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,340
to a straight science fiction
comic book,

426
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:58,249
<i>and he transported from here
to his home planet</i>

427
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,679
<i>and had various adventures.</i>

428
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,349
I come from a planet called Earth,

429
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,849

430
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,120

431
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,259
The origin of Adam Strange
is almost like

432
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,259
<i>a reversal of the Superman origin.</i>

433
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,859
<i>Strange came from Earth and ended up</i>

434
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,329
on a strange planet
that he became the hero of.

435
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,920
<i>Adam Strange should be
our cue to the audience</i>

436
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,199
that this is more than just
about the Superman mythology.

437
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,300
<i>If you know comic books,</i>

438
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,439
<i>Doomsday's origins happen on Krypton,</i>

439
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,909
<i>and we'll be wrapping Doomsday
into the story.</i>

440
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,809
There's a item called the Black Mercy

441
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,949
<i>that shows up in the pilot,
and that's related</i>

442
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,579
<i>to a character named Mongul
that we hope to bring in.</i>

443
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,680
There's a world in the comics
called Thanagar

444
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,719
<i>where Hawkman and Hawkwoman are from,</i>

445
