Ma'am, are you okay?
How badly are you hurt?

43
00:03:35.282 --> 00:03:38.418
- What happened?
- Explosion.

44
00:03:38.452 --> 00:03:40.621
Nitrogen oxide spilled.

45
00:03:41.756 --> 00:03:43.524
Sulfur dioxide is airborne.

46
00:03:43.558 --> 00:03:45.560
What does that mean?

47
00:03:45.593 --> 00:03:47.695
Clear the area.

48
00:03:49.764 --> 00:03:51.933

49
00:03:51.966 --> 00:03:54.969

How do we fix it?

50
00:03:56.771 --> 00:03:58.005

- Over here, they're all dead.

Hey, Chuck, don't you
hear the phone ringing?

61
00:04:58.933 --> 00:05:02.570
Good morning, Chuck and Mae's.
How can I help you?

62
00:05:02.603 --> 00:05:04.806
Yes, we're open.

63
00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:07.474
Of course, we're open.
They just called, you answered.

64
00:05:07.508 --> 00:05:09.544
Hello. We're open.

65
00:05:09.577 --> 00:05:13.681
<i>Toxic acid rain is on its way to
the south shore of Long Island,</i>

66
00:05:13.714 --> 00:05:15.817
<i>as a direct result

67
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.753

<i>Weather is up

72
00:05:44.912 --> 00:05:47.582
Hey, the news said
the explosion this morning

73
00:05:47.615 --> 00:05:49.684
was causing the weather
to be a bit screwy.

74
00:05:49.717 --> 00:05:52.086
Um, and to expect acid rain?

75
00:05:55.723 --> 00:05:58.960
Ricardo,
where's my garbage can?!

76
00:05:58.993 --> 00:06:01.428
Just hope they don't try and
tell us to evacuate the city.

77
00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:04.799
I mean, it's always a problem trying
to get people from here to listen.

78
00:06:04.832 --> 00:06:08.435
Besides being short man power,
pain in the ass.

79
00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:10.004
Well, when are you guys
closing up shop?

80
00:06:10.037 --> 00:06:12.139
Supposed to be next week.

81
00:06:12.173 --> 00:06:14.008
Just don't know how...

82
00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:16.611
I mean, they already reassigned
most my staff.

83
00:06:16.644 --> 00:06:19.113
- That's crazy.
- Where's this woman?

84
00:06:19.146 --> 00:06:21.816
I got table one,
I got table two up there,

85
00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:24.018
and what's she got there?
She's talking to the cop again?

86
00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:25.286
Of course,
she's talking to the cop.

87
00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:28.789
I have seven bacon, egg
and cheese sandwiches with mayo.

88
00:06:28.823 --> 00:06:32.894
One P&J. And for Nina,
I got the tofu scramble,

89
00:06:32.927 --> 00:06:37.598
soy bacon, soy cheese, with
nutritional yeast on gluten-free bread.

90
00:06:37.632 --> 00:06:40.701
And also an extra sandwich
in there for the lieutenant.

91
00:06:40.735 --> 00:06:42.637
Thank you. And say hello
to Chuck for me.

92
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.072
- Mae! Pickup!
- I will.

93
00:06:45.106 --> 00:06:46.240
And that'll be $40.

94
00:06:46.274 --> 00:06:49.644
And I put extra napkins and
ketchup in there for the doc.

95
00:06:49.677 --> 00:06:52.013
I know he always asks,
but you should watch him eat.

96
00:06:52.046 --> 00:06:54.548
<i>It's actually pretty comical.</i>

97
00:06:54.582 --> 00:06:56.651
<i>The man never
uses any napkins.</i>

98
00:07:04.058 --> 00:07:06.493
Thank you, Mae,
I'll see you tomorrow.

99
00:07:06.527 --> 00:07:08.129
Alright,
we'll see you tomorrow.

100
00:07:09.263 --> 00:07:11.866
The flower looks nice.

101
00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:14.635
Thank you.
Be safe out there.

102
00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:15.836
Every day.

103
00:07:22.543 --> 00:07:23.911
Where you been?

104
00:07:23.945 --> 00:07:25.613
- Cop again?
- Sarge.

105
00:07:25.646 --> 00:07:27.181
Please.

106
00:07:27.214 --> 00:07:28.983
Take this out there.
If I hear this guy

107
00:07:29.016 --> 00:07:29.984
yell about his food
one more time...

108
00:07:30.017 --> 00:07:32.019
He's sweet.

109
00:07:32.053 --> 00:07:33.988
- Who's sweet? The cop?
- Yeah.

110
00:07:34.021 --> 00:07:36.624
Uh-huh, sweet.
Whoop-diggity-diablo.

111
00:07:36.657 --> 00:07:38.826
That's why I'm going to Atlantic
City this weekend by myself.

112
00:07:38.859 --> 00:07:41.494

Uh...

127
00:09:28.402 --> 00:09:30.938
You know what,
maybe it's the acid rain.

Huh?

129
00:09:32.406 --> 00:09:35.009
But, seriously, maybe we could
just requisition a new one.

You know, a five-screen,
75 inches.

131

Just fix the TV.

Yeah, I got your two.

135

Toss 'em up, man,
I'm hungry as hell this morning.

136
00:10:08.309 --> 00:10:11.278
That's... yours.

137
00:10:11.312 --> 00:10:12.746
I could eat a horse.

138
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.381
Hey, don't say that
around Rossi.

139
00:10:14.415 --> 00:10:17.151
- Why not?
- She's vegan this week.

140
00:10:17.184 --> 00:10:19.386
Vegan.

141

You're on a roll this morning, huh?

142
00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:24.158
I wouldn't mind
if they were actually funny.

143
00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.229
Hey, Dash, you get that report
back from the doc yet?

144
00:10:28.262 --> 00:10:29.997
No, not yet.

145
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.699
I'll ask him
when I give him his sandwich.

146
00:10:31.732 --> 00:10:33.834
Alright.
Please, follow up with that.

147
00:10:33.868 --> 00:10:36.370
I want everything nice and tight
when McQueen brings Gallo in.

148
00:10:36.403 --> 00:10:38.205
Alright, will do.
Yes, sir.

149
00:10:39.974 --> 00:10:41.442
This is a piece of shit.

150
00:10:41.475 --> 00:10:43.744
I don't think it's this.

151
00:10:43.777 --> 00:10:45.346
I think
it's the cable company.

152
00:10:45.379 --> 00:10:48.682
- Call the cable company.
- They already canceled us.

153
00:10:48.716 --> 00:10:52.953
- What?
- It'll work, man, just play with the wire.

154
00:10:52.987 --> 00:10:54.255
Get on it. I need to fix this.

155
00:10:54.288 --> 00:10:55.422
I need to find out
what's going on

156
00:10:55.456 --> 00:10:57.291
from that explosion
this morning.

157
00:11:06.233 --> 00:11:08.702
So pissed I have to drive
all the way to Amityville

158
00:11:08.736 --> 00:11:10.137
for this stupid ticket!

159
00:11:12.507 --> 00:11:14.241
This is dumb.

160
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.989
Hey, wait a minute,
don't spend all day on that, Malloy.

161
00:11:29.023 --> 00:11:30.791
Still need that closet cleared.

162
00:11:30.824 --> 00:11:32.393
What closet?

163
00:11:32.426 --> 00:11:33.827
Downstairs in the morgue.

164
00:11:33.861 --> 00:11:36.430
Doc's been going apeshit
with his lack of space.

165
00:11:36.463 --> 00:11:39.133
He does realize that we're
merging with Central, right?

166
00:11:42.504 --> 00:11:43.737
You ready for this?

167
00:11:44.772 --> 00:11:45.873
I don't know.

168
00:11:45.906 --> 00:11:48.242
I've never done this before.

169
00:11:50.444 --> 00:11:51.712
I don't know.

170
00:11:57.151 --> 00:12:00.421
That's my little girl.

171
00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:05.793
We're gonna find the guys
who did this.

172
00:12:08.362 --> 00:12:11.332
We-we can't let her mother
see her like this.

173
00:12:17.037 --> 00:12:19.907
There's just some paperwork in the
office that you have to fill out.

174
00:12:24.812 --> 00:12:27.014
I-I gotta go. I can't stay.

175
00:12:27.047 --> 00:12:28.882
I gotta go open the bar.

176
00:12:35.923 --> 00:12:37.258
Dammit, Mae.

177
00:12:37.291 --> 00:12:39.893
Always forgets
to toast my buns.

178
00:12:39.927 --> 00:12:41.563
I bet she'd love
to toast your buns.

179
00:12:41.596 --> 00:12:44.932
Hey, hey, Dashy, be a mensch,
throw me my sandwich over here.

180
00:12:46.267 --> 00:12:48.269
- Yeah.
- Better hurry up and eat that

181
00:12:48.302 --> 00:12:49.370
before the lieutenant grabs it.

182
00:12:49.403 --> 00:12:51.105
Oh, you got jokes today too.

183
00:12:51.138 --> 00:12:52.973
Okay, I got one.

184
00:12:53.007 --> 00:12:55.109
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

185
00:12:55.142 --> 00:12:57.344
- You're wife.
- Ex-wife.

186
00:12:57.378 --> 00:12:59.413
She called a few times.

187
00:12:59.446 --> 00:13:02.049
Hey, you guys notice
the radios on the fritz?

188
00:13:02.082 --> 00:13:05.386
Yes, I noticed.
Been like that all frickin' morning.

189
00:13:05.419 --> 00:13:08.188
Hm, maybe it has something
to do with that acid rain.

190
00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:13.193
Dash, don't take too long
with that, please.

191
00:13:13.227 --> 00:13:14.461
I need you back at the front.

192
00:13:14.495 --> 00:13:16.397
Flannery called out again.

193
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:21.368
All these damn department cuts,
so short-staffed.

194
00:13:21.402 --> 00:13:23.837
Well, just...
Look, we get too busy we call Massapequa.

195
00:13:23.871 --> 00:13:26.608
Man, screw Massapequa.

196
00:13:26.641 --> 00:13:29.276
They always feel like
we owe them something.

197
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.078
Oh, and your wife
really did call.

198
00:13:31.111 --> 00:13:33.013
Sounded important, you should
probably call her back.

199
00:13:33.047 --> 00:13:34.982
Ex-wife. Alright.

200
00:13:38.653 --> 00:13:41.322
- Oh...
- Hey, you blind?

201
00:13:41.355 --> 00:13:44.458
What's a matter with you?
Six feet.

202
00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:47.094
Live it. Learn it.

203
00:13:47.127 --> 00:13:48.596
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
I didn't see you.

204
00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:53.167
Obviously.
You're making me claustrophobic.

205
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.470
Where can I go
to pay a ticket?

206
00:13:56.504 --> 00:13:59.340
Sure, the office at
the front desk can assist you.

207
00:13:59.373 --> 00:14:00.240
You can't?

208
00:14:00.274 --> 00:14:02.209
Ma'am, the office
at the front desk...

209
00:14:02.242 --> 00:14:04.178
You don't have to get
pissed about it.

210
00:14:04.211 --> 00:14:05.647
What's wrong with people?

211
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.248
Ma'am, I'm just trying
to answer your question.

212
00:14:08.282 --> 00:14:10.217
You need to stop
what you're doing

213
00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:13.287
and assist a person
who needs help.

214
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:17.458
Serve and protect!
Right?

215
00:14:18.158 --> 00:14:20.027
So, serve!

216
00:14:20.695 --> 00:14:22.162
Unbelievable.

217
00:14:22.196 --> 00:14:23.598
Ma'am, maybe you should
go to Central

218
00:14:23.631 --> 00:14:26.066
to get that taken care of.
Our hub is in transition and...

219
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.235
Never mind!

220
00:14:28.268 --> 00:14:33.207
Talking to you
is like talking to the wall!

221
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.080
Seriously?

222
00:14:48.288 --> 00:14:49.356
Mm...

223
00:14:50.725 --> 00:14:52.393
Hello, ma'am.

224
00:14:52.426 --> 00:14:54.228
Can I help you?

225
00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:56.163
We will see.

226
00:14:56.196 --> 00:15:01.168
I want to talk to someone
about paying this damn ticket.

227
00:15:01.201 --> 00:15:05.305
Great, well, our cashier
isn't in right now.

228
00:15:05.339 --> 00:15:07.307
She'll be in at nine.

229
00:15:07.341 --> 00:15:09.042
And she'll be happy
to help you then.

230
00:15:09.076 --> 00:15:12.547
Of course! You'll be glad
to take my damn money.

231
00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.314
I beg your pardon?

232
00:15:14.348 --> 00:15:17.484
I need to get
back to the city.

233
00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:23.123
I have to wait
until someone comes later?

234
00:15:23.157 --> 00:15:26.360
You're here. I'm here.

235
00:15:26.393 --> 00:15:28.362
Can't you do it?

236
00:15:28.395 --> 00:15:30.197
As I said, ma'am, I'm sorry.

237
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:31.965
I have to watch the front desk.

238
00:15:31.999 --> 00:15:34.001
Now our front desk liaison
will be in...

239
00:15:34.034 --> 00:15:36.671
What else can you people
do to annoy me?

240
00:15:36.704 --> 00:15:42.009
What are you doing right now?
Just watching TV and stuffing your face?

241
00:15:42.042 --> 00:15:45.513
I hope you get diabetes.

242
00:15:45.547 --> 00:15:49.684
It's just around the corner
from high blood pressure.

243
00:15:49.717 --> 00:15:50.819
Yeah, I know.

244
00:15:50.852 --> 00:15:54.455
It's right around the corner
from You're Being Rude Lane

245
00:15:54.488 --> 00:15:56.624
and Take a Seat Boulevard.

246
00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.168
Drop your weapon! Police!

247
00:16:08.202 --> 00:16:09.470
Don't do it!

248
00:16:09.504 --> 00:16:11.639
I said don't do it!

249
00:16:11.673 --> 00:16:13.207
Drop it!

250
00:16:25.452 --> 00:16:28.155
- That's how you do it.
- Nice shooting, Rossi.

251
00:16:28.188 --> 00:16:29.323
Sergeant you scared me.

252
00:16:29.356 --> 00:16:30.357
I scared you?

253
00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:32.560
Your shooting scares me.

254
00:16:32.594 --> 00:16:35.563
Oh, my...
Oh, that smells so good.

255
00:16:35.597 --> 00:16:37.732
Mae sends her
very famous sandwich.

256
00:16:37.765 --> 00:16:41.703
One soy bacon, tofu,
scrambled nutritional yeast,

257
00:16:41.736 --> 00:16:44.137
with soy cheese
on gluten free toast for you.

258
00:16:44.171 --> 00:16:47.174
Yes, she made it special
just for me, that's so cool.

259
00:16:47.207 --> 00:16:49.476
There are a lot of words that come into
my head when I think of that sandwich.

260
00:16:49.511 --> 00:16:51.445
Cool? Yeah, definitely
wasn't one of them.

261
00:16:51.478 --> 00:16:53.280
Oh, Sergeant,
I wanted to ask you:

262
00:16:53.313 --> 00:16:55.215
Did you sign off on my leave?
I wanna make sure

263
00:16:55.249 --> 00:16:57.150
I have everything in order
before I head out.

264
00:16:57.184 --> 00:16:58.285
When did you
plan on taking it?

265
00:16:58.318 --> 00:16:59.687
Monday. My parent's anniversary

266
00:16:59.721 --> 00:17:01.689
is next Friday
down in Chapel Hill.

267
00:17:01.723 --> 00:17:03.390
Yes, yes I did.
It's in your inbox.

268
00:17:03.423 --> 00:17:05.392
- Okay, thank you.
- Yes, and remember to tell front desk

269
00:17:05.425 --> 00:17:07.094
so you can block out your time.
Okay?

270
00:17:07.127 --> 00:17:09.664
Okay. It means the world to me
to get to go.

271
00:17:09.697 --> 00:17:11.733
And there's so much to do.
I mean, I still gotta get down there,

272
00:17:11.766 --> 00:17:14.167
gotta meet up with my family.
I've gotta get fitted, get a dress...

273
00:17:14.201 --> 00:17:15.837
Okay. Great, is there
anything else you need from me?

274
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:18.071
- Nope. No.
- Alright. Okay.

275
00:17:18.105 --> 00:17:20.107
Oh, and Rossi,
when you're firing a gun,

276
00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.475
you don't need
to go "blam, blam."

277
00:17:21.509 --> 00:17:23.745
The gun does
the talking for you.

278
00:17:23.778 --> 00:17:26.280
Yeah, you saw that.
Yes, sir.

279
00:17:47.602 --> 00:17:49.102
Oh, hey, Dashy.

280
00:17:49.136 --> 00:17:50.270
Morning, Doc.

281
00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.275
Alright, thanks.

282
00:17:55.309 --> 00:17:56.878
Is this the dead dancer?

283
00:17:56.911 --> 00:17:59.747
Uh, no, she's between the two...

284
00:17:59.781 --> 00:18:02.282
No, actually this is
the dead dancer, you were right.

285
00:18:02.316 --> 00:18:04.251
I heard McQueen caught
the bastard that did her in.

286
00:18:04.284 --> 00:18:05.887
- Yeah.
- Look, he did her pretty good, huh?.

287
00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.156
- I don't know.
- Looks crowded in here today.

288
00:18:09.189 --> 00:18:11.659
Oh, yeah.
I got two on gurneys,

289
00:18:11.693 --> 00:18:14.629
four in the hallway,
four in the freezer.

290
00:18:14.662 --> 00:18:16.263
I had to send
six back to county.

291
00:18:16.296 --> 00:18:17.397
You should send
most of them to county

292
00:18:17.431 --> 00:18:18.833
so we can start breaking this
place down for the merge.

293
00:18:18.866 --> 00:18:20.868
That merge is gonna suck.

294
00:18:20.902 --> 00:18:22.604
Yeah, tell me about it.

295
00:18:24.171 --> 00:18:25.540
Do you want a napkin?

296
00:18:25.573 --> 00:18:27.742
- I got plenty.
- No, I'm alright.

297
00:18:27.775 --> 00:18:30.578
That... that can't be sanitary.

298
00:18:31.813 --> 00:18:34.515
- What?
- Never mind.

299
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:36.517
McQueen's on his way back
with Gallo.

300
00:18:36.551 --> 00:18:38.720
I'd really like that report today
so we can slam dunk this guy.

301
00:18:38.753 --> 00:18:40.521
Oh, absolutely, man,
absolutely.

302
00:18:40.555 --> 00:18:43.223
Oh, by the way,
the air conditioner,

303
00:18:43.256 --> 00:18:44.525
uh, did you order the new one?

304
00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:46.259
Did you fix that closet door?

305
00:18:46.293 --> 00:18:47.795
Oh, you know, the closet...

306
00:18:47.829 --> 00:18:49.697
That door, it won't close

307
00:18:49.731 --> 00:18:51.032
'cause it's swelling
because of the heat.

308
00:18:51.065 --> 00:18:54.401
- Come again? The heat?
- Uh, yeah, you know, that's what happens.

309
00:18:54.434 --> 00:18:56.771
The door swells 'cause of the
heat and you can't close it.

310
00:18:56.804 --> 00:18:59.807
Okay. The bathroom's out of order.
What's up with that?

311
00:18:59.841 --> 00:19:02.844
Uh, I don't know.
Some sorta shit.

312
00:19:02.877 --> 00:19:05.245
- Yeah, backed up?
- Yeah, backed up.

313
00:19:06.547 --> 00:19:07.949
Alright, I'll have Malloy
take a look at it

314
00:19:07.982 --> 00:19:09.349
when he comes down
for the closet.

315
00:19:09.383 --> 00:19:12.319
- Thanks.
- Ira, please.

316
00:19:12.887 --> 00:19:14.354
Jesus!

317
00:19:14.388 --> 00:19:15.790
Not you, too.

318
00:19:15.823 --> 00:19:19.493
Uh, rigor mortis set in.
Hits the nerve. You're fine.

319
00:19:19.527 --> 00:19:20.862
Believe me, she's dead.

320
00:19:20.895 --> 00:19:22.730
She ain't coming back to life.

321
00:19:22.764 --> 00:19:25.900
So, uh, where's Skeeter?
I got his PB&J.

322
00:19:25.933 --> 00:19:27.669
Yo, Childs.

323
00:19:27.702 --> 00:19:31.238
Uh, he doesn't like to be
called Skeeter anymore.

324
00:19:31.271 --> 00:19:33.440
- Um...
- Really? Since when?

325
00:19:33.473 --> 00:19:35.977
Eh, I don't know.
Gets in these moods.

326
00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:37.979
Hey, Childs your food's here.

327
00:19:38.012 --> 00:19:40.180
Great, I'll be right there!

328
00:19:44.952 --> 00:19:47.220
Good morning, Sergeant Dash.

329
00:19:47.254 --> 00:19:48.355
Good morning, Skeeter...

330
00:19:48.388 --> 00:19:49.957
I mean, Childs.
How's it going Childs?

331
00:19:49.991 --> 00:19:52.259
Well, I'm just fine, thanks.

332
00:19:52.292 --> 00:19:54.227
So... Oh, thank you.

333
00:19:54.261 --> 00:19:56.463
Uh, what did Nina
order this morning?

334
00:19:56.496 --> 00:19:57.598
She go back to the ham and eggs?

335
00:19:57.632 --> 00:19:59.000
Ah! I bet she didn't.

336
00:19:59.033 --> 00:20:00.601
She's a pretty tough chick.

337
00:20:00.635 --> 00:20:02.704
- I think she's rad.
- Rad?

338
00:20:02.737 --> 00:20:05.707
- What the hell does rad mean?
- It's abbreviated for radical.

339
00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.542
See? He knows.

340
00:20:07.575 --> 00:20:10.343
Whatever, you guys are idiots.

341
00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:12.947
- Uh, is she still on her crusade?
- Yes, she is.

342
00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:14.448
Uh, I'll catch up
with you guys later.

343
00:20:14.481 --> 00:20:16.450
Please, get me that report
on the dancer, Doc.

344
00:20:16.483 --> 00:20:17.785
- Absolutely.
- Please.

345
00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:23.958
Take the paper
out of the folder,

346
00:20:23.991 --> 00:20:25.526
and let's see
how we're doing in the pool.

347
00:20:31.666 --> 00:20:33.701
Ah, shit. I lost.

348
00:20:45.079 --> 00:20:46.948
Welcome home, Joe Gallo.

349
00:20:53.453 --> 00:20:54.789
Malloy...

350
00:21:09.402 --> 00:21:11.672
Large crowds have been seen
in bizarre gatherings

351
00:21:11.706 --> 00:21:14.441
in local cemeteries
throughout the Pittsburgh area.

352
00:21:14.474 --> 00:21:17.945
Police are investigating if there's a possible
connection with the graveyard vandalism

353
00:21:17.979 --> 00:21:20.047
that's been going on
throughout Pennsylvania.

354
00:21:20.081 --> 00:21:23.851
I'm Gerri Tauver
and this WTJC News New York.

355
00:21:23.885 --> 00:21:27.722
Have a great day, New York.
I will see you tomorrow.

356
00:21:27.755 --> 00:21:29.824
And we're out.

357
00:21:29.857 --> 00:21:31.759
Good job, everybody. Great show.

358
00:21:31.793 --> 00:21:33.961
Thomas, grab Gerri
a bottle of water.

359
00:21:33.995 --> 00:21:36.831
All right, guys,
let's get this going and get...

360
00:21:36.864 --> 00:21:40.333
<i>Gerri, Joe Gallo's been caught.</i>

361
00:21:40.367 --> 00:21:42.435
- What was that?
- <i>Yes, you heard me right.</i>

362
00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:44.505
- Joe Gallo?
- <i>Joe Gallo.</i>

363
00:21:44.539 --> 00:21:46.941
- Where is he at?
- He's gonna be processed in Amityville.

364
00:21:46.974 --> 00:21:49.409
Okay.
I want to cover that story.

365
00:21:49.442 --> 00:21:50.878
<i>Alright, I'll see you in a few.</i>

366
00:21:50.912 --> 00:21:52.345
On my way right now.

367
00:22:11.899 --> 00:22:13.901
God, this place
is falling apart.

368
00:22:32.119 --> 00:22:34.055
Jimmy?

369
00:22:34.088 --> 00:22:36.023
What's up, kid?
What's going on?

370
00:22:39.093 --> 00:22:40.728
Where's-where's your mother?

371
00:22:40.761 --> 00:22:41.762
She left.

372
00:22:41.796 --> 00:22:44.665
What do you mean she left?
I don't understand.

373
00:22:44.699 --> 00:22:46.466
Her and Beau
went away for the weekend.

374
00:22:46.499 --> 00:22:50.938
What? She just
dumped you off and took off?

375
00:22:50.972 --> 00:22:53.541
Yup, and she said she tried
to call you, but of course,

376
00:22:53.574 --> 00:22:55.643
as usual, you didn't answer.

377
00:22:56.476 --> 00:22:57.678
This is...

378
00:23:05.853 --> 00:23:07.889
- <i>Roy...</i>
- Carrie, how you just gonna drop the kid off

379
00:23:07.922 --> 00:23:09.891
without even talking to me?
I'm at work.

380
00:23:09.924 --> 00:23:11.726
We're moving stations.
You know that.

381
00:23:11.759 --> 00:23:13.426
I'm busy, and you go off
with your boyfriend...

382
00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:14.695
<i>Just deal with it. Bye.</i>

383
00:23:15.796 --> 00:23:18.465
Perfect.

384
00:23:24.005 --> 00:23:25.773
She didn't answer.

385
00:23:25.806 --> 00:23:27.474
I knew she wouldn't.

386
00:23:27.508 --> 00:23:28.709
Did you eat breakfast?

387
00:23:28.743 --> 00:23:30.511
Not hungry.

388
00:23:30.544 --> 00:23:32.813
Okay, let me see,
who can I call so...

389
00:23:32.847 --> 00:23:34.782
- you're not bored?
- I'm not bored.

390
00:23:34.815 --> 00:23:36.751
I can help you out
around here if you'd like.

391
00:23:36.784 --> 00:23:38.152
Remember like
last time I was here?

392
00:23:38.185 --> 00:23:39.587
Just give me a second
to think, kid.

393
00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:40.688
Um...

394
00:23:40.721 --> 00:23:43.124
I just...

395
00:23:43.157 --> 00:23:46.761
I just wish things could go back
to the way they used to be with us.

396
00:23:46.794 --> 00:23:48.596
Sorry if I ruined your weekend.

397
00:23:48.629 --> 00:23:50.097
No, no,
it's not your fault, kid.

398
00:23:50.131 --> 00:23:52.233
It's not.

399
00:23:52.266 --> 00:23:54.702
I just didn't expect you to be
tossed in my lap like this.

400
00:23:54.735 --> 00:23:56.637
I feel like
that's always the case though.

401
00:23:56.671 --> 00:23:59.840
You're either too busy or just
don't want me around, I guess.

402
00:23:59.874 --> 00:24:03.244
Alright, let me see...

403
00:24:03.277 --> 00:24:05.846
I can drop you off at Nana's.

404
00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.115
That's right,
today's chemo day for her.

405
00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:09.817
Hey, Dash!

406
00:24:12.787 --> 00:24:14.487
Do I disappoint you?

407
00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:17.758
Dash, I need you in front...

408
00:24:17.792 --> 00:24:19.927
Yeah, I'm coming!

409
00:24:19.961 --> 00:24:21.963
No, you don't
disappointment me, kid.

410
00:24:21.996 --> 00:24:23.531
Alright, listen, stay here.

411
00:24:23.564 --> 00:24:25.700
Let me just figure
this shit out, alright.

412
00:24:25.733 --> 00:24:28.669
Uh, hey, if anyone's
a disappointment,

413
00:24:28.703 --> 00:24:30.037
I feel like it should be me.

414
00:24:33.708 --> 00:24:35.943
What an asshole!

415
00:24:37.211 --> 00:24:39.814
Yeah, that's my dad.

416
00:24:42.817 --> 00:24:45.886
Yep, still an asshole.

417
00:24:54.729 --> 00:24:57.031
<i>Joe Gallo, the so-called
"Amityville Strangler",</i>

418
00:24:57.064 --> 00:24:58.199
<i>is it true
that you confessed to...</i>

419
00:24:58.232 --> 00:24:59.200
<i>What is this,
your hall of shame?</i>

420
00:24:59.233 --> 00:25:00.668
Man, you missed it earlier.

421
00:25:00.701 --> 00:25:02.570
That old lady out there,

422
00:25:02.603 --> 00:25:04.605
she's like "I hope
you get high cholesterol..."

423
00:25:04.638 --> 00:25:06.974
McQueen's here.

424
00:25:07.008 --> 00:25:09.844
- <i>One piggy, two piggy, three piggy.</i>
- <i>C'mon, tell me the story!</i>

425
00:25:09.877 --> 00:25:12.079
<i>McQueen.
Give me the story, McQueen.</i>

426
00:25:12.113 --> 00:25:13.414
<i>Later on, lady. Try then.</i>

427
00:25:13.447 --> 00:25:15.850
- <i>What about the dead dancer?</i>
- <i>You should come back... Hey!</i>

428
00:25:15.883 --> 00:25:19.286
What about the dead... C'mon.
C'mon!

429
00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.222
McQueen are you still
using excessive force?

430
00:25:21.255 --> 00:25:23.124
Lady, do you see
any marks on this man?

431
00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.596
Look, enough.
Stick with the truth.

432
00:25:28.629 --> 00:25:29.797
Where to with this one, Dashy?

433
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:32.033
- Stick him in two.
- Ha! Suits him.

434
00:25:32.066 --> 00:25:34.268
- Let us get a story.
- Looks like a number two.

435
00:25:34.301 --> 00:25:35.736
Lady...

436
00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:37.772
Good to see you guys.

437
00:25:37.805 --> 00:25:40.608
Gallo, what about
the victim's family?

438
00:25:40.641 --> 00:25:42.877
I didn't do it!

439
00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:44.645
- Tell me something!
- You want a story?

440
00:25:44.678 --> 00:25:46.747
- Yeah! I do, I do!
- Hey, far enough.

441
00:25:46.781 --> 00:25:49.316
- Hup, hup.
- Detective, can we get an interview?

442
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:51.886
Detective! Detective!

443
00:25:51.919 --> 00:25:54.155
Get your hands off me!

444
00:25:54.188 --> 00:25:56.123
Miss Tauver. Mrs. Tauver.

445
00:25:56.157 --> 00:26:00.094
Hi, Lieutenant Howie Stevenson,
this is my precinct.

446
00:26:00.127 --> 00:26:01.662
- Hey. Yeah.
- You want an interview?

447
00:26:01.695 --> 00:26:03.130
Okay, come talk to me.

448
00:26:03.164 --> 00:26:04.832
- Come follow me.
- Did you get that.

449
00:26:04.865 --> 00:26:08.669
If you guys wanted to do an
interview later...

450
00:26:08.702 --> 00:26:10.871
Let's go get some permission.

451
00:26:12.339 --> 00:26:15.142
I would've had
to drive to Amityville

452
00:26:15.176 --> 00:26:19.747
to have all this happen.
So much drama in one place.

453
00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:22.683
All I wanna do is pay my ticket.

454
00:26:22.716 --> 00:26:24.885
Yeah, I'll be back
to process you.

455
00:26:24.919 --> 00:26:27.988
Don't worry you've
got a long time to hang out in here.

456
00:26:28.022 --> 00:26:31.292
Thanks, Officer Sterling!

457
00:26:31.325 --> 00:26:34.261
You think this all a joke,
don't you?

458
00:26:34.295 --> 00:26:35.963
Yeah.

459
00:26:35.996 --> 00:26:39.200
I know you destroyed all the
security footage from the club.

460
00:26:41.102 --> 00:26:42.336
But you forgot one.

461
00:26:44.004 --> 00:26:47.374
The one you choked
the life out of that girl

462
00:26:47.408 --> 00:26:50.978
for five... long minutes.

463
00:26:51.011 --> 00:26:52.780
The ATM machine.

464
00:26:52.813 --> 00:26:54.949
We've got that footage.

465
00:26:58.219 --> 00:27:01.055
In the end,
everything comes out in the wash.

466
00:27:01.088 --> 00:27:02.957
- I'm innocent!
- Yeah.

467
00:27:04.925 --> 00:27:08.028
Psst. Dumbass says what?

468
00:28:08.322 --> 00:28:13.027
Okay, will you at least
let her know that Mel called?

469
00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:16.297
Okay? Okay, thanks.

470
00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:19.733
<i>Local authorities
say acid rain is on its way.</i>

471
00:28:19.767 --> 00:28:22.870
<i>The governor informs all
citizens in the surrounding areas</i>

472
00:28:22.903 --> 00:28:27.141
<i>to stay indoors for the next 48
hours until the acid rain passes.</i>

473
00:28:27.174 --> 00:28:29.343
<i>We'll bring you more
as the story unfolds.</i>

474
00:28:29.376 --> 00:28:32.046
What the... Acid rain?

475
00:28:32.079 --> 00:28:33.814
What kind of shit is that?

476
00:28:33.847 --> 00:28:36.183
That doesn't even make no sense.

477
00:28:46.427 --> 00:28:48.295
Unbelievable.

478
00:28:48.329 --> 00:28:50.931
There's the big old acid rain.

479
00:28:53.267 --> 00:28:54.268
What the...?

480
00:30:02.637 --> 00:30:05.105
<i>I know, I know,</i>

481
00:30:05.139 --> 00:30:07.174
<i>blame the weather man.
Blame the weather man.</i>

482
00:30:07.207 --> 00:30:08.909
<i>But, seriously, folks,</i>

483
00:30:08.942 --> 00:30:11.078
<i>we are in for
some beautiful weather,</i>

484
00:30:11.111 --> 00:30:13.881
<i>as you can see on the chart right
here, later in the week.</i>

485
00:30:13.914 --> 00:30:16.317
<i>And I'm talking nothing
but gorgeous sunshine.</i>

486
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:19.019
<i>So it's gonna be really nice to
experience that later in the week.</i>

487
00:30:19.053 --> 00:30:20.988
<i>However, I want to
reiterate the fact</i>

488
00:30:21.021 --> 00:30:24.291
<i>that the governor has handed
down a red district warning.</i>

489
00:30:24.325 --> 00:30:27.494
<i>And that's due to this
unstable, uncharacteristically</i>

490
00:30:27.529 --> 00:30:30.164
<i>bizarre weather we're
experiencing right now.</i>

491
00:30:30.197 --> 00:30:31.932
<i>That was due to
the chemical explosion</i>

492
00:30:31.965 --> 00:30:33.367
<i>at the military base,
of course.</i>

493
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.469
<i>Uh, so just be careful
out there, and, uh...</i>

494
00:30:35.503 --> 00:30:39.073
<i>Jim, why don't you tell us about
those Wolverines last night, huh?</i>

495
00:30:39.106 --> 00:30:42.042
<i>In that three-point
overtime loss.</i>

496
00:30:42.076 --> 00:30:45.379
<i>My dog coulda kicked a better field goal
than that one, and Charlie has one leg.</i>

497
00:30:45.412 --> 00:30:48.148
<i>We are off
the air right now, right?</i>

498
00:30:48.182 --> 00:30:49.049
<i>They heard that?</i>

499
00:30:49.083 --> 00:30:50.984
<i>Well, you know me, folks,</i>

500
00:30:51.018 --> 00:30:53.187
<i>uh, always making a joke.</i>

501
00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:54.522
<i>All right.</i>

502
00:31:24.351 --> 00:31:26.954
Ah, I love the aroma
of this place.

503
00:31:26.987 --> 00:31:28.922
Hey, Childs, can you
clean out those sinks!

504
00:31:28.956 --> 00:31:30.357
Childs...

505
00:31:31.225 --> 00:31:32.459
Where are you?

506
00:31:35.396 --> 00:31:38.700
Eh, it's just a muscle spasm.
It hit a nerve.

507
00:31:38.733 --> 00:31:40.300
Rigor mortis set in.

508
00:31:41.268 --> 00:31:42.504
Happens all the time.

509
00:31:42.537 --> 00:31:45.707
- All the time?
- All the time.

510
00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:48.008
How do you do it?

511
00:31:49.511 --> 00:31:50.978
Experience, kid.

512
00:31:51.011 --> 00:31:52.413
- Oh...
- Experience.

513
00:31:56.551 --> 00:31:59.353
All I know
is he went to do a sound gig

514
00:31:59.386 --> 00:32:01.155
and he never came back home.

515
00:32:04.626 --> 00:32:06.093
Uh, Dash.

516
00:32:06.126 --> 00:32:07.961
One second.

517
00:32:07.995 --> 00:32:10.164
Mr. Cooper,
this is Sergeant Dash.

518
00:32:10.197 --> 00:32:12.399
- Nice to meet you.
- He's gonna assist you with the rest of this.

519
00:32:12.433 --> 00:32:14.301
Thank you for your patience.

520
00:32:14.334 --> 00:32:15.537
I got it.

521
00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:17.171
Hey, Mr. Cooper.

522
00:32:18.405 --> 00:32:20.407
Alright...

523
00:32:20.441 --> 00:32:22.644
Okay, so tell me
about your brother.

524
00:32:22.677 --> 00:32:25.680
He's been missing
about two weeks?

525
00:32:25.713 --> 00:32:29.416
Did he have any other names or
aliases he might've gone by?

526
00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:34.321
- You left that out of the report.
- Yeah, I-I guess, uh...

527
00:32:34.354 --> 00:32:39.293
He had a nickname he used in his
industry, uh, he's goes by Scratch.

528
00:32:39.326 --> 00:32:42.329
- Scratch?
- Cor... Yes, Scratch.

529
00:32:42.362 --> 00:32:46.467
Okay. Industry.
What type of work did he do?

530
00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.435
Oh, he's in entertainment.

531
00:32:48.469 --> 00:32:52.707
He does sound for movies.

532
00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:55.577
Okay, uh, Sam, if you just
have a seat over there

533
00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:57.512
while I run a few reports
I'd appreciate it.

534
00:32:57.545 --> 00:33:00.515
Thanks, and, uh,
where's the closest bathroom?

535
00:33:00.548 --> 00:33:02.717
Um, you can just go through
that door right there,

536
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:05.285
head down to the right,
and your down on the right...

537
00:33:05.319 --> 00:33:07.087
Hey, you cut in line!

538
00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.624
- I was here first!
- What's your issue?

539
00:33:09.657 --> 00:33:12.326
Go to hell, asshole!

540
00:33:12.359 --> 00:33:14.562
- Ma'am...
- I have been waiting all day.

541
00:33:14.596 --> 00:33:16.531
You do not lay
your hands on somebody.

542
00:33:16.564 --> 00:33:20.668
Can I pay this ticket already?

543
00:33:20.702 --> 00:33:23.103
As I told you before, yes.

544
00:33:23.136 --> 00:33:25.372
- But you...
- This is just stupid.

545
00:33:25.405 --> 00:33:28.510
Your system is stupid!

546
00:33:28.543 --> 00:33:30.444
Ma'am, please.

547
00:33:30.477 --> 00:33:32.714
Have a seat and we will
help you out soon.

548
00:33:32.747 --> 00:33:35.249
- You've said that 20 times!
- Please.

549
00:33:38.452 --> 00:33:39.453
Thank you.

550
00:33:42.724 --> 00:33:45.025
Don't ever lay your hands
on somebody in my station.

551
00:34:01.275 --> 00:34:03.143
I'll be out pinning up
the new ones.

552
00:34:03.176 --> 00:34:04.144
Okay.

553
00:34:06.814 --> 00:34:08.448
- Hi, can I help you?
- Hi.

554
00:34:08.482 --> 00:34:11.418
Yes, I'm looking
for the bathroom.

555
00:34:11.451 --> 00:34:12.319
- Bathroom?
- Yes.

556
00:34:12.352 --> 00:34:14.421
Right down this hallway,
follow the signs,

557
00:34:14.454 --> 00:34:16.390
if you hit the jail cell
you've gone too far.

558
00:34:16.423 --> 00:34:17.559
Thank you.

559
00:34:21.128 --> 00:34:23.798
Hey, Malloy, I need you to get those,
uh, tools out of the jail area.

560
00:34:26.734 --> 00:34:29.169
- Hey, Brian. Morning.
- Hey, doll.

561
00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:40.882
Hey, it's after 9:00 am!

562
00:34:40.915 --> 00:34:44.786
Can someone, please,
for the love of God...

563
00:34:44.819 --> 00:34:46.386
If you just give me a minute,

564
00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:47.722
I'd be more than happy
to help you.

565
00:34:47.755 --> 00:34:49.289
Help me!

566
00:35:01.268 --> 00:35:02.870
I mean, really.

567
00:35:02.904 --> 00:35:06.808
I need to get back to the city!

568
00:35:06.841 --> 00:35:09.744
And nobody has helped me yet.

569
00:35:09.777 --> 00:35:11.378
Yes, I am aware.

570
00:35:11.411 --> 00:35:14.849
No, no, no!

571
00:35:16.818 --> 00:35:18.318
Yep...

572
00:35:20.622 --> 00:35:22.724
- Hey, Brian...
- I'm not going to sit down!

573
00:35:22.757 --> 00:35:25.325
- What's with her?
- Oh, your typical pissed off lady.

574
00:35:25.359 --> 00:35:27.294
But this one's on steroids.

575
00:35:27.327 --> 00:35:29.496
- No!
- Ma'am, our clerk called out sick today,

576
00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:32.634
so if you just give me five minutes,
I'd be more than happy to assist you.

577
00:35:32.667 --> 00:35:33.701
Help me!

578
00:35:33.735 --> 00:35:36.904
- Ma'am...
- Lady, relax.

579
00:35:36.938 --> 00:35:38.405
He said he'll be
with you in a minute.

580
00:35:38.438 --> 00:35:40.340
And getting all pissy with him
isn't gonna help.

581
00:35:42.342 --> 00:35:44.846
Karma! That's what it is.

582
00:35:44.879 --> 00:35:46.748
Jimmy, come back here
with me, please.

583
00:35:46.781 --> 00:35:49.751
- Karma!
- Are you done, ma'am?

584
00:35:49.784 --> 00:35:51.385
Is there something
I can help you with?

585
00:35:51.418 --> 00:35:52.486
No, son, not right now.

586
00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:54.287
Just have a seat right there,
at my desk, please.

587
00:35:54.321 --> 00:35:55.723
Holy shit!

588
00:35:55.757 --> 00:35:57.324
I hear you're going on
vacation next week.

589
00:35:57.357 --> 00:35:58.660
Yes, I so can't wait.

590
00:35:58.693 --> 00:36:00.193
I'm heading home for a few days.

591
00:36:00.227 --> 00:36:02.563
- Nice.
- Did they make coffee yet?

592
00:36:02.597 --> 00:36:04.264
Yeah, but it's decaf.

593
00:36:04.297 --> 00:36:06.500
- Why do we keep doing this?
- No, no!

594
00:36:06.534 --> 00:36:08.569
Who keeps making decaf?
I gotta talk to somebody.

595
00:36:08.603 --> 00:36:11.673
Ma'am, I'm just asking for
a few minutes.

596
00:36:11.706 --> 00:36:13.407
Please, I will help you.

597
00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.909
How you been?

598
00:36:14.942 --> 00:36:17.578
- You've been saying that!
- Please.

599
00:36:22.016 --> 00:36:23.685
At least somebody's
happy to see me, right?

600
00:36:23.718 --> 00:36:24.886
Hey, stop that.

601
00:36:24.919 --> 00:36:26.453
Your father adores you.

602
00:36:26.486 --> 00:36:28.589
- Yeah.
- Just look over at his wall.

603
00:36:28.623 --> 00:36:33.360
You're plastered everywhere, kid,
it's like, the wall of Jimmy Dash.

604
00:36:33.393 --> 00:36:35.830
I guess.

605
00:36:35.863 --> 00:36:39.499
Oh, wow, he even has my Little
League baseball card here.

606
00:36:39.534 --> 00:36:42.737
See? Go ahead
with your bad self.

607
00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:46.373
He's got every special day,
every special event.

608
00:36:46.406 --> 00:36:48.241
He's got it all.

609
00:36:48.275 --> 00:36:50.745
- Guess so.
- Just look... You can come across if you want.

610
00:36:50.778 --> 00:36:51.879
I won't tell him.

611
00:36:57.051 --> 00:36:58.418
Thank you.

612
00:36:58.452 --> 00:37:02.289
Ah, don't worry about it.
I adore Jimmy.

613
00:37:02.322 --> 00:37:05.459
Yeah, sometimes I just wish
I could hit the restart button.

614
00:37:05.492 --> 00:37:06.861
You know?

615
00:37:06.894 --> 00:37:08.863
You can.

616
00:37:08.896 --> 00:37:11.699
See, I think that's why we get
various days to do it right.

617
00:37:11.733 --> 00:37:14.702
It's almost like every day
is a restart button.

618
00:37:16.436 --> 00:37:19.439
Oh, my God,
did I just give you advice? Whoo.

619
00:37:19.473 --> 00:37:21.709
I believe you did, Rossi.

620
00:37:21.743 --> 00:37:23.811
Thank you.
I am grateful.

621
00:37:25.412 --> 00:37:27.615
I will help with
Miss Impatient over there.

622
00:37:29.483 --> 00:37:30.551
I'm really grateful.

623
00:37:35.322 --> 00:37:37.658
Good morning, ma'am.
How can I help you today?

624
00:37:37.692 --> 00:37:41.596
- Finally! Someone.
- Yeah.

625
00:37:51.939 --> 00:37:53.373
Can you do
one sideways, too?

626
00:37:56.544 --> 00:37:57.578
Thank you.

627
00:37:58.946 --> 00:38:01.414
Oh, you look great!

628
00:38:01.448 --> 00:38:03.918
Twenty minutes, guys.
That's all I can give you.

629
00:38:03.951 --> 00:38:06.087
That is all we need,
Lieutenant Stevenson.

630
00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.989
Oh, please, call me Howie.

631
00:38:08.022 --> 00:38:09.891
- Okay.
- Follow me, please.

632
00:38:09.924 --> 00:38:11.826
I will show you all
to the holding cells.

633
00:38:13.493 --> 00:38:15.530
Thanks, really appreciate this.

634
00:38:21.434 --> 00:38:23.738
- What's this?
- Peace offering.

635
00:38:23.771 --> 00:38:25.973
We had an extra bacon, egg
and cheese sandwich.

636
00:38:27.575 --> 00:38:29.710
Jimmy, I know you feel...

637
00:38:29.744 --> 00:38:31.846
Can I get a black coffee
instead of the soda?

638
00:38:31.879 --> 00:38:34.347
Yeah, sure.

639
00:38:34.381 --> 00:38:36.617
- Uh, Nina, can you...
- On it. Just black?

640
00:38:36.651 --> 00:38:38.485
Mm-hm. You're the best.

641
00:38:38.519 --> 00:38:42.790
I feel like at times...
you resent me.

642
00:38:42.824 --> 00:38:46.828
No, you need to
understand something.

643
00:38:46.861 --> 00:38:49.797
Your mother and I,
we shouldn't have happened.

644
00:38:49.831 --> 00:38:51.866
We're like oil and water.

645
00:38:51.899 --> 00:38:54.434
We just never could mesh
and handle things.

646
00:38:54.467 --> 00:38:55.937
We always fought.

647
00:38:59.574 --> 00:39:02.009
Mom told me that you
married her because of me.

648
00:39:02.043 --> 00:39:04.377
And that's why
you guys always fought.

649
00:39:04.411 --> 00:39:07.915
'Cause you felt
trapped with her.

650
00:39:07.949 --> 00:39:10.483
Your mother,
she told you this?

651
00:39:11.152 --> 00:39:12.352
Yeah.

652
00:39:13.888 --> 00:39:16.389
You did come as a surprise.

653
00:39:16.423 --> 00:39:18.626
I don't regret you,
I never have, son.

654
00:39:19.527 --> 00:39:20.928
I tried.

655
00:39:20.962 --> 00:39:23.363
I tried my hardest to make
things work with your mom.

656
00:39:24.497 --> 00:39:26.634
We just...
we never got along.

657
00:39:26.667 --> 00:39:28.536
We just constantly fought.

658
00:39:34.041 --> 00:39:36.777
Oh, Malloy, I need you to start
on that closet in the morgue.

659
00:39:36.811 --> 00:39:38.145
I'd like to finish
that by today.

660
00:39:38.179 --> 00:39:39.412
You got it, boss.

661
00:39:39.446 --> 00:39:41.883
You say I came as a surprise?

662
00:39:41.916 --> 00:39:43.851
Is that why you left me?

663
00:39:43.885 --> 00:39:46.020
No, I-I never left you.

664
00:39:46.053 --> 00:39:49.790
I left because I didn't think it was the
most healthy environment to raise you in.

665
00:39:49.824 --> 00:39:51.993
The yelling, the fighting...

666
00:39:53.027 --> 00:39:54.128
Your birth...

667
00:39:55.663 --> 00:39:57.565
That was the best chapter
of my life.

668
00:39:58.866 --> 00:40:00.134
I love you, boy.

669
00:40:00.167 --> 00:40:02.703
You're my son,
that will never change.

670
00:40:02.737 --> 00:40:05.673
I know I missed
some life events.

671
00:40:06.874 --> 00:40:08.441
But it was because of work,

672
00:40:08.475 --> 00:40:10.811
never because
I resented you, ever.

673
00:40:11.779 --> 00:40:13.881
I'm so proud of you.

674
00:40:13.915 --> 00:40:15.850
I'm proud of the kid
that you are and...

675
00:40:15.883 --> 00:40:17.685
proud of the man you'll become.

676
00:40:18.686 --> 00:40:20.121
I love you too, Dad.

677
00:40:20.154 --> 00:40:21.522
Being that we're gonna...

678
00:40:21.555 --> 00:40:22.757
You're gonna be here
with me all day,

679
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:26.794
how about you helping me out,
and I, uh, throw you 50 bucks?

680
00:40:26.827 --> 00:40:28.062
Sixty?

681
00:40:28.095 --> 00:40:29.163
How about 40?

682
00:40:29.196 --> 00:40:30.898
Okay, I like the sound of 50.

683
00:40:30.932 --> 00:40:34.001
Alright. Hey, Malloy,
I got a good helper for you.

684
00:40:34.035 --> 00:40:37.038
Hey, you listen to what he
says, you do what he says.

685
00:40:37.071 --> 00:40:38.773
Awesome, less work for me.

686
00:40:38.806 --> 00:40:41.976
Let's go, kid. First we gotta
stop and get the... ladder.

687
00:40:51.252 --> 00:40:54.221
Excuse me!

688
00:40:54.255 --> 00:40:55.690
Ma'am, just please calm down.

689
00:40:55.723 --> 00:40:57.558
- It was my fault.
- Really?

690
00:40:57.591 --> 00:40:59.093
- I got distracted by all the commotion.
- Really?

691
00:40:59.961 --> 00:41:01.896
I'm done!

692
00:41:01.929 --> 00:41:04.231
Okay, that's unnecessary.

693
00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.568
Can you go grab that woman?

694
00:41:07.601 --> 00:41:09.670
Ma'am, I can assist you.

695
00:41:13.007 --> 00:41:15.475
I'm sorry, ma'am,
I can assist you.

696
00:41:17.678 --> 00:41:19.981
Ma'am, please come back inside,
it's raining.

697
00:42:31.819 --> 00:42:34.789
<i>This just in, it is
no longer safe to go outside.</i>

698
00:42:34.822 --> 00:42:37.091
<i>We've never seen anything
like this before.</i>

699
00:42:37.124 --> 00:42:39.060
<i>But it appears
that the rain is deadly.</i>

700
00:42:39.093 --> 00:42:40.961
<i>That's right,
the rain is deadly.</i>

701
00:42:40.995 --> 00:42:43.597
<i>We are officially a code red!</i>

702
00:42:43.631 --> 00:42:44.965
<i>Do not leave your homes!</i>

703
00:42:44.999 --> 00:42:47.768
<i>I warn you,
do not leave your homes</i>

704
00:42:47.802 --> 00:42:50.171
<i>under any circumstance,
for no reason!</i>

705
00:42:50.204 --> 00:42:52.840
<i>Do not leave your homes.</i>

706
00:42:57.278 --> 00:43:00.815
- Alright, watch your back.
- God, I hate coming down here.

707
00:43:02.016 --> 00:43:03.150
Ira!

708
00:43:04.151 --> 00:43:06.153
We need help.

709
00:43:06.187 --> 00:43:09.990
One, two, three.

710
00:43:12.893 --> 00:43:13.794
What happened here?

711
00:43:13.828 --> 00:43:16.730
- Rain, burned her.
- The rain did that?

712
00:43:25.439 --> 00:43:28.776
Oh, that's some shit
right there.

713
00:43:32.413 --> 00:43:35.116
- What do you want me to do?
- Really, dude?

714
00:43:35.149 --> 00:43:39.220
You work in a freaking morgue.
Get your ass up.

715
00:43:39.253 --> 00:43:41.222
Can you guys
go upstairs, please?

716
00:43:41.255 --> 00:43:42.990
Authorized personnel only!

717
00:43:43.023 --> 00:43:45.359
Okay, get the hell outta here.

718
00:43:47.027 --> 00:43:48.729
Can you clean up a bit?
Bandage her up, Doc?

719
00:43:48.762 --> 00:43:51.065
Bandages? I don't know, I think
she needs to go to the hospital.

720
00:43:51.098 --> 00:43:53.434
You can't go outside,
the rain will literally tear you apart!

721
00:43:53.467 --> 00:43:56.370
- Maybe even kill you, you can't.
- Please, go upstairs. Please.

722
00:43:56.403 --> 00:43:57.705
Nobody's leaving
the station, okay.

723
00:43:57.738 --> 00:44:01.208
God knows who or what's trapped
out there in those streets.

724
00:44:38.445 --> 00:44:39.947
It is coming down.

725
00:45:07.942 --> 00:45:10.778
What the hell was that?
What the hell was that?

726
00:45:17.885 --> 00:45:19.987
Sergeant Dash,
this is Officer Nina Ross...

727
00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:22.389
Ser... Sergeant? Sergeant?

728
00:45:28.262 --> 00:45:29.263
Hello?

729
00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:44.044
Why is there no service?!

730
00:45:44.078 --> 00:45:45.547
Why is there no service?

731
00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:46.814
Why is there no service?

732
00:45:48.983 --> 00:45:51.252
Sergeant Dash,
Sergeant Dash!

733
00:45:54.522 --> 00:45:55.889
Dash!

734
00:45:57.258 --> 00:45:58.792
Dash!

735
00:46:05.199 --> 00:46:07.368
Hi, my pretty.

736
00:46:34.495 --> 00:46:36.096
Is that the dancer
from the Gallo case?

737
00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:38.098
Guys, please, back.
Please, please, back, back.

738
00:46:38.132 --> 00:46:40.501
What... What're you doing here?

739
00:46:40.535 --> 00:46:43.003
- What happened to her?
- Hey! Do what I asked.

740
00:46:43.037 --> 00:46:44.204
You don't need to be in here.
Go!

741
00:46:44.238 --> 00:46:45.607
What're you doing?

742
00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:47.975
Don't make this about ratings,
she needs help!

743
00:47:37.491 --> 00:47:38.926
No, no, no...

744
00:47:38.959 --> 00:47:40.628
Hey, Jimmy,
have you seen my flathead

745
00:47:40.662 --> 00:47:42.630
- or-or my tape measure?
- Nope.

746
00:47:42.664 --> 00:47:45.032
Hm.
I know where I left 'em.

747
00:47:45.065 --> 00:47:47.401
I'm gonna go get them and
hit the restroom first. Okay?

748
00:47:47.434 --> 00:47:49.370
Alright, no problem.
Um, can you get me a soda?

749
00:47:49.403 --> 00:47:51.972
- Like a diet pop, maybe?
- Sure, sure. You got it kid.

750
00:47:52.005 --> 00:47:53.140
Alright, thanks.

751
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:57.978
Son of a bitch.

752
00:48:03.685 --> 00:48:06.086
Hey, guys,
what's with all the commotion?

753
00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:08.255
She nearly got herself
killed outside in the rain.

754
00:48:08.288 --> 00:48:10.190
She needs
medical attention, Doc.

755
00:48:10.224 --> 00:48:12.594
Medical attention? How?

756
00:48:12.627 --> 00:48:15.062
I'm a morgue technician.

757
00:48:15.095 --> 00:48:16.631
- Help me.
- Oh, my God.

758
00:48:16.664 --> 00:48:21.101
Help me.

759
00:48:21.135 --> 00:48:22.469
Take this off her.

760
00:48:37.552 --> 00:48:39.621
- This burns!
- Go wash your hands, kid.

761
00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:45.025
Out of order!
Son of a bitch!

762
00:48:46.694 --> 00:48:49.163
We don't know the extent
of what it can do.

763
00:48:49.196 --> 00:48:51.533
Well, we know it
burns your damn skin.

764
00:48:57.438 --> 00:49:00.642
Looking at this woman's face,
I'd say the rain

765
00:49:00.675 --> 00:49:03.745
has turned into a high corrosive
form of hydrochloric acid.

766
00:49:03.778 --> 00:49:07.014
Um, should wipe
everything down with water.

767
00:49:16.524 --> 00:49:19.226
It should've been you.

768
00:49:19.259 --> 00:49:21.529
You shoulda been
the one who vanished.

769
00:49:24.498 --> 00:49:26.200
Not Steve.

770
00:49:28.168 --> 00:49:29.537
You're worthless.

771
00:49:29.571 --> 00:49:32.406
You can't hold down a job...

772
00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:35.209
relationship.

773
00:49:36.511 --> 00:49:38.345
I hate being you.

774
00:49:55.563 --> 00:49:59.767
Maybe I should go see
Father Michael...

775
00:50:03.671 --> 00:50:06.173
Son of a bitch, it burns!

776
00:50:07.542 --> 00:50:10.277
Move!

777
00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:11.679
Officer, are you okay?

778
00:50:11.713 --> 00:50:13.748
Out of order!
I need water!

779
00:50:13.781 --> 00:50:15.550
I need water!

780
00:50:15.583 --> 00:50:16.684
Doc, please help her.

781
00:50:18.853 --> 00:50:21.556
I can't, Dashy, she's dead.

782
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:24.424
Ah, damn it.

783
00:50:24.458 --> 00:50:27.127
Who is she?

784
00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:28.462
Some woman
who came to pay a ticket.

785
00:50:30.397 --> 00:50:31.633
I guess we can dismiss that.

786
00:50:31.666 --> 00:50:33.233
Wow.

787
00:50:35.269 --> 00:50:37.839
- Water, water, it burns!
- What's wrong?

788
00:50:50.885 --> 00:50:52.520
Are you okay?

789
00:50:56.858 --> 00:50:58.726
Officer?

790
00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:00.327
Officer...

791
00:51:02.329 --> 00:51:03.531
Are you alright?

792
00:51:12.874 --> 00:51:14.776
Oh, Lord.

793
00:51:22.215 --> 00:51:24.151
Oh, thank God,
you're still alive.

794
00:52:03.524 --> 00:52:05.660
<i>Everyone in our
viewing audience,</i>

795
00:52:05.693 --> 00:52:07.494
<i>this is a dire situation.</i>

796
00:52:07.528 --> 00:52:10.531
<i>I repeat, a dire situation.</i>

797
00:52:10.565 --> 00:52:13.266
<i>Heed the governor's warning
and stay inside.</i>

798
00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:15.502
<i>We've never seen
anything like this,</i>

799
00:52:15.536 --> 00:52:17.905
<i>ever in the New York
metropolitan area.</i>

800
00:52:17.939 --> 00:52:20.407
<i>This is a full lockdown.</i>

801
00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:22.744
<i>I repeat, a full lock...</i>

802
00:52:22.777 --> 00:52:23.945
<i>Are... Bob?</i>

803
00:52:23.978 --> 00:52:25.546
<i>Are-are... okay.</i>

804
00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:27.214
<i>Yeah, we're-we're still on.</i>

805
00:52:27.247 --> 00:52:28.482
<i>We're still on,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

806
00:52:28.516 --> 00:52:30.217
<i>we're here to let you know</i>

807
00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:33.387
<i>this is a full lockdown.
I repeat, a full lockdown.</i>

808
00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:37.592
<i>Anyone outside should get
indoors as quickly as possible.</i>

809
00:52:37.625 --> 00:52:40.528
<i>Indoors as quickly as possible.
Lucy?</i>

810
00:52:40.561 --> 00:52:42.930
<i>Bob, Lucy just fell down.</i>

811
00:52:42.964 --> 00:52:47.334
<i>Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
I repeat, a dire situation.</i>

812
00:52:47.367 --> 00:52:50.437
<i>Get inside and spread the word
and stay tuned.</i>

813
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:53.808
<i>The governor has issued
a full lockdown in effect.</i>

814
00:52:53.841 --> 00:52:56.376
<i>You've gotta stay inside,
you've gotta heed the warning</i>

815
00:52:56.410 --> 00:52:58.780
<i>all over the New York
metropolitan area.</i>

816
00:52:58.813 --> 00:53:01.716
<i>Do... do...
do we still have pow...</i>

817
00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:28.308
So, what happened
to your camera?

818
00:53:28.341 --> 00:53:31.012
Uh, the battery died,
so I guess I need a new one.

819
00:53:31.045 --> 00:53:32.513
- Got ya.
- Yeah.

820
00:53:32.547 --> 00:53:34.381
- Pardon our mess.
- Oh, it's fine.

821
00:53:34.414 --> 00:53:36.684
We're merging precincts,
I'm sure you know.

822
00:53:36.718 --> 00:53:38.285
Joe Gallo.

823
00:53:38.318 --> 00:53:40.621
Miss Tauver here would like
a moment of your time.

824
00:53:40.655 --> 00:53:41.956
Hope you're not busy.

825
00:53:50.330 --> 00:53:52.767
Um, I will get you all a chair.

826
00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:54.334
- We're good.
- You sure?

827
00:53:54.367 --> 00:53:56.604
Yeah, but we would
like that 20 minutes.

828
00:53:56.637 --> 00:54:00.608
Twenty minutes. And be sure to stay
at least two feet away from the cell.

829
00:54:00.641 --> 00:54:03.745
And I'm gonna trust the two
of you all to make your way

830
00:54:03.778 --> 00:54:05.378
back to the front
when you're done.

831
00:54:05.412 --> 00:54:06.514
Got it.

832
00:54:06.547 --> 00:54:08.549
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
- You're welcome.

833
00:54:08.583 --> 00:54:10.317
And Howie, please.

834
00:54:10.350 --> 00:54:12.419
Mm-hm.

835
00:54:12.452 --> 00:54:14.622
Make sure you stop by my office
before you all leave.

836
00:54:14.655 --> 00:54:15.723
Okay.

837
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:18.425
Joe Gallo...

838
00:54:20.094 --> 00:54:21.729
are you ready for us?

839
00:54:25.933 --> 00:54:27.501
I'm always ready.

840
00:54:27.535 --> 00:54:28.536
Good.

841
00:54:39.647 --> 00:54:42.817
Hey, Childs, a little bit
of flashlight or something.

842
00:54:42.850 --> 00:54:44.919
I don't wanna be
bumping into shit all day.

843
00:54:44.952 --> 00:54:47.955
Well, I'm trying.
Where are those candles from last week?

844
00:54:47.989 --> 00:54:49.791
I can't see shit.

845
00:54:50.725 --> 00:54:52.660
Oh, never mind.

846
00:54:52.693 --> 00:54:54.829
- I found a lighter.
- Good, great.

847
00:54:54.862 --> 00:54:56.964
Great, use the lighter
to find the flashlight.

848
00:54:56.998 --> 00:54:58.699
Alright!

849
00:55:03.504 --> 00:55:05.006
Ira, Willy, you there?

850
00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:08.308
Childs, John Childs.

851
00:55:19.987 --> 00:55:22.422
I tried everything.
All the equipment is dead.

852
00:55:22.455 --> 00:55:26.060
Is it because of the rain?
Cable, phones, radio.

853
00:55:26.093 --> 00:55:28.495
Childs. John Childs.

854
00:55:28.529 --> 00:55:30.064
Ira, Willy, you there?

855
00:55:33.034 --> 00:55:34.569
What're you digging for?

856
00:55:34.602 --> 00:55:36.003
That lighter was mine,
by the way.

857
00:55:36.037 --> 00:55:38.105
- Just joking.
- Please.

858
00:55:38.139 --> 00:55:39.574
Being all the lines are down,

859
00:55:39.607 --> 00:55:41.876
I was looking for
a prepaid phone, you know?

860
00:55:41.909 --> 00:55:43.144
A burner phone?

861
00:55:43.177 --> 00:55:45.378
Yeah, yeah, a burner.
They would get service.

862
00:55:49.083 --> 00:55:51.418
- Try this one.
- You have a burner?

863
00:55:51.451 --> 00:55:52.753
It-it's a work phone.

864
00:55:52.787 --> 00:55:54.789
Ira, anyone in the morgue?

865
00:55:56.724 --> 00:55:57.959
Malloy...

866
00:55:59.827 --> 00:56:01.095
You went outside?

867
00:56:01.128 --> 00:56:03.598
- Your shirt's wet.
- No shit.

868
00:56:06.534 --> 00:56:08.936
I just peaked out
the side door.

869
00:56:08.970 --> 00:56:12.039
- How is it?
- Hot as a bitch out there.

870
00:56:13.007 --> 00:56:15.509
Rain is boiling hot, man.

871
00:56:16.177 --> 00:56:17.745
Some biblical shit.

872
00:56:19.146 --> 00:56:20.948
- You hear from, Ira?
- No.

873
00:56:24.518 --> 00:56:27.054
The phone's dead.
It seemed to let me text my friend Seth.

874
00:56:27.088 --> 00:56:28.589
I'll see if he replies.

875
00:56:31.859 --> 00:56:33.060
Did you hear from him?

876
00:56:33.094 --> 00:56:34.829
It's only been like ten minutes.

877
00:56:37.865 --> 00:56:39.100
Hey, Rossi.

878
00:56:39.133 --> 00:56:40.635
Do me a favor
and go get the TV people

879
00:56:40.668 --> 00:56:41.802
from their interview.

880
00:56:41.836 --> 00:56:43.571
The deal was for 20 minutes.

881
00:56:47.808 --> 00:56:49.777
Man, I ain't never
seen no shit like this.

882
00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:51.712
Man, this is...

883
00:56:51.746 --> 00:56:54.582
worse than the time we were
all locked down for quarantine

884
00:56:54.615 --> 00:56:55.850
from the virus.

885
00:56:56.784 --> 00:56:58.152
Yeah.

886
00:56:58.185 --> 00:57:01.055
I was told that there was
three dead women by you.

887
00:57:01.088 --> 00:57:02.823
- Joe Gallo, how do you feel?
- I'm innocent.

888
00:57:02.857 --> 00:57:04.457
How do you feel
about all this?

889
00:57:04.491 --> 00:57:05.960
What's going on
through your mind?

890
00:57:09.764 --> 00:57:11.464
- How do you feel?
- Go to hell.

891
00:57:11.498 --> 00:57:12.733
I wanna talk to my lawyer.

892
00:57:12.767 --> 00:57:14.902
You seem like
you really don't care.

893
00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:18.906
You seem relaxed
about all of it.

894
00:57:21.509 --> 00:57:23.811
We deserve to hear
what's going.

895
00:57:25.179 --> 00:57:26.514
I'm innocent.

896
00:57:26.547 --> 00:57:29.150
Pico... Pico...

897
00:57:29.183 --> 00:57:31.619
Pico, you need to get the shot.

898
00:57:55.977 --> 00:57:57.645
What the hell was...?

899
00:58:35.216 --> 00:58:36.851
Miss Tauver?

900
00:58:47.728 --> 00:58:49.196
This is Officer Nina Rossi.

901
00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:51.032
I repeat,
this is Officer Nina Rossi.

902
00:58:51.065 --> 00:58:52.166
Can anyone hear me?

903
00:58:54.668 --> 00:58:56.804
Dash? Can anyone hear me?

904
00:58:59.673 --> 00:59:02.343
Is someone in the bathroom?

905
00:59:02.376 --> 00:59:04.578
This is Officer Nina Rossi.

906
00:59:04.612 --> 00:59:06.781
I repeat,
is someone in the bathroom?

907
00:59:29.703 --> 00:59:33.140
Where is Joe Gallo?
What did you do with Joe Gallo?!

908
00:59:35.142 --> 00:59:37.745
Where is Gallo?
What did you do with Gallo?!

909
00:59:37.778 --> 00:59:40.047
He was trying...

910
00:59:40.081 --> 00:59:42.349
I don't know...

911
00:59:47.721 --> 00:59:49.990
I understand.
I understand.

912
00:59:50.024 --> 00:59:51.625
I understand!

913
00:59:51.659 --> 00:59:54.095
I need you
to drop the screwdriver,

914
00:59:54.128 --> 00:59:56.730
and put your hands
above your head.

915
00:59:56.764 --> 01:00:01.669
- I can't!
- Put your hands above your head for me, okay?

916
01:00:54.488 --> 01:00:55.256
Who is that?

917
01:00:55.289 --> 01:00:58.359
Who is... Who is that?

918
01:01:07.434 --> 01:01:09.136
What'd stupid say?

919
01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:47.374
You boys alright in here?

920
01:01:47.408 --> 01:01:49.376
Oh, sorry,
I didn't mean to frighten you.

921
01:01:49.410 --> 01:01:51.979
Alright, you're good.
What's going on out there?

922
01:01:52.012 --> 01:01:54.315
Oh, nothing. We just lost
a little bit of power.

923
01:01:54.348 --> 01:01:55.883
We should be back on
in a minute.

924
01:01:55.916 --> 01:01:59.420
- Uh, where's Malloy?
- Uh, bathroom?

925
01:02:02.189 --> 01:02:05.426
- Yeah, yeah. Alright. See ya.
- Alright.

926
01:02:34.855 --> 01:02:36.558
Thunder scare you, too?

927
01:02:36.591 --> 01:02:38.993
- Scare who?
- You.

928
01:02:39.026 --> 01:02:41.195
Motherfucker,
I ain't scared of shit.

929
01:02:42.363 --> 01:02:44.164
C'mon, c'mon...

930
01:02:47.268 --> 01:02:49.169
I think we need
a new coffee pot.

931
01:02:52.039 --> 01:02:54.008
This one's broke.

932
01:03:04.318 --> 01:03:06.554
What the hell?

933
01:03:06.588 --> 01:03:10.090
Guys, there's something
in here with us.

934
01:03:10.124 --> 01:03:11.492
What do you mean?

935
01:03:11.526 --> 01:03:14.928
I said there's something
in here with us.

936
01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.001
Something we're not sure of?

937
01:03:21.035 --> 01:03:23.137
No, it was right here!

938
01:03:23.170 --> 01:03:25.372
I mean, we have rats
in the station at night.

939
01:03:25.406 --> 01:03:27.542
I've seen 'em.
They're-they're big, like small cats.

940
01:03:32.379 --> 01:03:33.548
What the hell is that?

941
01:03:36.350 --> 01:03:37.619
That's no rat.

942
01:03:37.652 --> 01:03:40.321
- That-that's...
- Where'd it go?

943
01:03:40.354 --> 01:03:41.623
Did you see it?
You see it?

944
01:03:41.656 --> 01:03:43.957
Yes.

945
01:03:43.991 --> 01:03:46.327
Looked like a dead guy
coming right at me.

946
01:04:16.924 --> 01:04:18.158
Childs!

947
01:04:25.432 --> 01:04:26.967
Hey-hey, Childs.

948
01:04:29.370 --> 01:04:30.404
Rossi!

949
01:04:30.437 --> 01:04:32.973
C'mon. C'mon, c'mon.
Jimmy, Jimmy!

950
01:04:35.476 --> 01:04:37.978
<i>C'mon, c'mon. Come in.</i>

951
01:04:38.011 --> 01:04:41.048
<i>Rossi. Jimmy.</i>

952
01:04:42.049 --> 01:04:43.083
<i>Malloy, can you hear...</i>

953
01:04:44.385 --> 01:04:46.554
<i>Rossi...</i>

954
01:04:46.588 --> 01:04:48.322
- Dad.
- <i>Jimmy!</i>

955
01:04:51.659 --> 01:04:53.127
Hello?

956
01:04:55.162 --> 01:04:58.232
This is crazy, man.

957
01:04:58.265 --> 01:05:02.269
Clearly we need to find out
what that was, that thing.

958
01:05:02.302 --> 01:05:03.571
That thing was a man, okay?

959
01:05:03.605 --> 01:05:06.106
That guy, that-that thing...

960
01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:09.577
He came in this morning, filed a missing
person's report, and he didn't look like that!

961
01:05:09.611 --> 01:05:12.112
Guys, my van's in the alley way.
We can go right out the back door.

962
01:05:12.146 --> 01:05:15.115
We aren't going anywhere until we
figure out and catch that thing

963
01:05:15.149 --> 01:05:16.518
that's in here with us.
Okay, Detective?

964
01:05:16.551 --> 01:05:17.652
Alright, we need to
clear the station

965
01:05:17.685 --> 01:05:18.686
and head down to the morgue.

966
01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:19.987
We grab my son, grab the others,

967
01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:21.054
and head out to the alley way.

968
01:05:21.088 --> 01:05:22.557
Guys, screw the alley way, okay.

969
01:05:22.590 --> 01:05:24.358
Look at my arm.

970
01:05:24.391 --> 01:05:28.228
That is acid rain that's coming
down, and it's pouring right now.

971
01:05:28.262 --> 01:05:30.063
We need to stay here! Okay?

972
01:05:30.097 --> 01:05:32.166
Catch that thing,
protect the precinct!

973
01:05:32.199 --> 01:05:34.268
Howie, Howie,
something is godly wrong.

974
01:05:34.301 --> 01:05:35.637
How'd that guy
turn into that...

975
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:39.206
I have no idea, okay.

976
01:05:39.239 --> 01:05:41.743
The explosion maybe? The rain?

977
01:05:41.776 --> 01:05:44.044
Okay, okay, okay.

978
01:05:44.077 --> 01:05:45.979
What's your plan, Sergeant?

979
01:05:46.013 --> 01:05:49.551
Like I said before,
we clear the station and go get my boy.

980
01:05:50.652 --> 01:05:52.687
Any luck on the radio?

981
01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.188
Rossi.

982
01:05:54.221 --> 01:05:56.490
- Rossi.
- Oh, damn, Rossi.

983
01:05:56.524 --> 01:05:59.527
I... she left a while ago
to get the TV people.

984
01:05:59.561 --> 01:06:01.094
From the interview.

985
01:06:01.128 --> 01:06:02.530
- Interview?
- Yes.

986
01:06:02.564 --> 01:06:04.198
- Gallo?
- Yes!

987
01:06:04.231 --> 01:06:05.999
Jesus Ch... Really?

988
01:06:06.033 --> 01:06:08.536
We need to get out
of this room, like now.

989
01:06:08.570 --> 01:06:11.371
At least try to find some place
to go make a call for help.

990
01:06:11.405 --> 01:06:13.173
Yeah, I'd love
to hear that call.

991
01:06:13.207 --> 01:06:15.275
Yeah, this is Amityville
station three.

992
01:06:15.309 --> 01:06:17.512
Yeah, we're under siege
by zombies.

993
01:06:17.545 --> 01:06:19.446
Yeah, we need help.
I said zombies.

994
01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:21.616
What the hell, man?
Are you finished, Detective?

995
01:06:21.649 --> 01:06:24.552
Yes, I am, Lieutenant.
Sorry, this town brings out the best in me.

996
01:06:24.586 --> 01:06:26.320
Alright,
I'm going to get my boy.

997
01:06:26.353 --> 01:06:29.056
- Dash, wait!
- No, no, don't wait, Howie!

998
01:06:29.089 --> 01:06:31.492
I'm going to get my son.
He's my responsibility.

999
01:06:31.526 --> 01:06:34.461
Yes, but what's your plan to go
when you get out there, Dash?

1000
01:06:34.495 --> 01:06:37.464
Okay? I mean,
we don't even know if...

1001
01:06:37.498 --> 01:06:40.602
Really?!
Do not even think like that.

1002
01:06:40.635 --> 01:06:42.369
When's the last time
you talked to him?

1003
01:06:43.738 --> 01:06:45.172
Uh...

1004
01:06:45.205 --> 01:06:46.608
What're you doing here?

1005
01:06:46.641 --> 01:06:49.109
- What happened to her?
- Hey! Do what I asked.

1006
01:06:49.142 --> 01:06:51.044
You don't need to be in here.
Go!

1007
01:06:51.078 --> 01:06:52.346
Dash!

1008
01:06:52.379 --> 01:06:54.516
C'mon, man,
you mean to tell me

1009
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:57.217
while all this shit's been going
down you haven't checked on your son?

1010
01:06:57.251 --> 01:06:58.620
This shit has
just started going on!

1011
01:06:58.653 --> 01:06:59.754
But that's your son.

1012
01:06:59.787 --> 01:07:02.322
Look, I've been a shit father
his entire life, man.

1013
01:07:02.356 --> 01:07:05.527
I know that. I mean,
that's not how I had it planned.

1014
01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:08.796
I had to get me cleaned up. Had to get me
straight before I'd be responsible for him.

1015
01:07:08.830 --> 01:07:11.633
And I screwed up with him.

1016
01:07:11.666 --> 01:07:13.400
I'm going to get my boy.

1017
01:07:15.302 --> 01:07:17.337
- Stay here, Detective.
- Yeah, the hell I am.

1018
01:07:29.416 --> 01:07:31.351
- Okay.
- Guys ready?

1019
01:07:31.385 --> 01:07:32.620
Yes!

1020
01:07:59.681 --> 01:08:01.181
Yo, Childs.

1021
01:08:02.784 --> 01:08:04.117
Childs.

1022
01:08:05.553 --> 01:08:06.721
Dash?

1023
01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:34.582
You were dead!
You were dead!

1024
01:09:11.619 --> 01:09:14.589
Jimmy, is Malloy still with you?

1025
01:09:14.622 --> 01:09:15.823
No.

1026
01:09:15.857 --> 01:09:17.190
<i>He stepped out a while...</i>

1027
01:09:19.694 --> 01:09:20.728
I don't know.

1028
01:09:20.762 --> 01:09:23.631
- Jimmy!
- <i>Dad...</i>

1029
01:09:23.665 --> 01:09:25.700
I hear something outside the door.
Is that you?

1030
01:09:25.733 --> 01:09:26.601
- No, no, no.
- No, Jimmy.

1031
01:09:26.634 --> 01:09:28.502
- Tell him to stay put.
- Jimmy, stay put.

1032
01:09:28.536 --> 01:09:29.570
Stay quiet.

1033
01:09:30.605 --> 01:09:31.906
Dad?

1034
01:09:34.909 --> 01:09:37.277
Jimmy!

1035
01:09:37.310 --> 01:09:39.681
I think it's Dr. Ira.
I'm gonna go peak out the door.

1036
01:09:39.714 --> 01:09:41.816
No! No, tell him
to stay put.

1037
01:09:41.849 --> 01:09:45.953
Jimmy, stay put. Stay quiet.
Do not go in the morgue.

1038
01:09:54.762 --> 01:09:56.898
<i>Jimmy, stay...</i>

1039
01:09:59.934 --> 01:10:01.268
<i>Jimmy...</i>

1040
01:10:08.442 --> 01:10:09.644
Jimmy!

1041
01:10:11.344 --> 01:10:13.915
- Let's go.
- McQueen, let's move.

1042
01:10:22.657 --> 01:10:24.357
Ah, shit.

1043
01:10:25.459 --> 01:10:27.294
There's more blood over here.

1044
01:10:31.899 --> 01:10:34.468
Whose keys and gun is that?

1045
01:10:34.501 --> 01:10:35.636
I'll check.

1046
01:10:42.944 --> 01:10:44.444
Shoot him in the head.

1047
01:10:47.915 --> 01:10:49.684
Whose damn keys are they?

1048
01:10:54.856 --> 01:10:56.557
That's two that
look like that.

1049
01:10:56.591 --> 01:10:57.558
Rossi's keys.

1050
01:10:57.592 --> 01:10:59.761
Gallo was probably
trying to use her to get out.

1051
01:10:59.794 --> 01:11:01.696
Probably thinking
the same thing we are.

1052
01:11:01.729 --> 01:11:03.430
Down and out
through the morgue.

1053
01:11:03.463 --> 01:11:06.399
This is unfreaking real, man.

1054
01:11:06.433 --> 01:11:08.268
I just killed a dead guy.

1055
01:11:09.771 --> 01:11:11.371
Can anyone hear me on this?

1056
01:11:13.641 --> 01:11:15.576
- Jimmy?
- <i>Dad?</i>

1057
01:11:15.610 --> 01:11:17.578
- Oh, thank God.
- It's a good thing.

1058
01:11:17.612 --> 01:11:19.346
Hey, let's move.
Let's go, let's go.

1059
01:11:50.812 --> 01:11:52.814
- Jimmy.
- Dad.

1060
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:57.051
Jimmy, I'm coming for you.

1061
01:12:00.755 --> 01:12:03.691
Okay, we got
confirmation, Sergeant.

1062
01:12:03.724 --> 01:12:05.425
Let's go get your boy.

1063
01:12:05.458 --> 01:12:07.394
Come on, guys, let's do this.

1064
01:12:58.613 --> 01:12:59.747
Move, move.

1065
01:13:00.581 --> 01:13:01.616
McQueen.

1066
01:13:08.055 --> 01:13:09.456
Wait, wait, wait....

1067
01:13:09.489 --> 01:13:10.490
What'd you see, LT?

1068
01:13:10.524 --> 01:13:12.560
Can't see shit, but I...

1069
01:13:12.593 --> 01:13:13.761
I hear something.

1070
01:13:14.929 --> 01:13:16.030
It's getting closer.

1071
01:13:32.246 --> 01:13:34.015
What the fu...

1072
01:13:37.652 --> 01:13:38.653
What the...

1073
01:13:42.256 --> 01:13:43.758
Is he dead?

1074
01:13:43.791 --> 01:13:44.926
Yeah.

1075
01:13:58.272 --> 01:13:59.674
You okay?

1076
01:13:59.707 --> 01:14:01.609
Yeah, just awesome!

1077
01:14:03.878 --> 01:14:05.546
C'mon, let's go, we gotta move.

1078
01:14:05.579 --> 01:14:07.148
Yeah, just give me a minute,
pard.

1079
01:14:08.816 --> 01:14:09.984
I'll tell you this,

1080
01:14:10.017 --> 01:14:12.253
she-she's definitely
not a vegan.

1081
01:14:12.286 --> 01:14:13.654
Let's go, let's move.

1082
01:14:13.688 --> 01:14:14.755
Come on.

1083
01:14:15.923 --> 01:14:17.024
Let's do it.

1084
01:14:50.658 --> 01:14:51.759
Nice shot, man.

1085
01:14:53.294 --> 01:14:54.996
No, no, no, no, no.

1086
01:14:55.029 --> 01:14:56.063
No, no, no.

1087
01:14:56.731 --> 01:14:57.765
No.

1088
01:14:58.699 --> 01:15:00.301
I just killed Malloy.

1089
01:15:00.334 --> 01:15:03.104
Brother, he-he was already dead.

1090
01:15:04.705 --> 01:15:06.240
What the fuck is going on?

1091
01:15:06.273 --> 01:15:08.642
Hey, hey...

1092
01:15:08.676 --> 01:15:10.578
We need to go
get your boy, okay?

1093
01:15:11.712 --> 01:15:12.747
C'mon, bud.

1094
01:15:17.718 --> 01:15:18.786
Jimmy...

1095
01:15:30.731 --> 01:15:33.034
- Dammit!
- Did you really think that was gonna work?

1096
01:15:33.067 --> 01:15:35.569
No, but the damn
emergency light should be on.

1097
01:15:35.603 --> 01:15:37.171
My batteries are starting
to go out on this.

1098
01:15:37.204 --> 01:15:39.073
Shh, shh,
I can hear something.

1099
01:15:43.644 --> 01:15:45.046
Get on the ground!

1100
01:15:45.079 --> 01:15:46.080
Get down!

1101
01:15:46.113 --> 01:15:47.281
Drop the sledgehammer.

1102
01:15:47.314 --> 01:15:49.216
Get on the ground!

1103
01:15:49.250 --> 01:15:53.120
There are zombies
here and you're harassing me?

1104
01:15:53.154 --> 01:15:55.689
I'm innocent,
don't you understand?

1105
01:15:55.723 --> 01:15:57.825
I didn't do it.
I'm not one of them.

1106
01:15:58.392 --> 01:15:59.727
I'm one of you!

1107
01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:01.328
You're not one of us.

1108
01:16:01.362 --> 01:16:03.631
You're a broken part
of the system.

1109
01:16:03.664 --> 01:16:07.201
And you got out while over
a dozen women lost their lives.

1110
01:16:07.234 --> 01:16:08.836
Get the hell out of here.

1111
01:16:09.837 --> 01:16:11.572
But I'm Joe Gallo!

1112
01:16:31.325 --> 01:16:32.693
Alright.

1113
01:16:34.061 --> 01:16:35.296
Jimmy?

1114
01:16:37.998 --> 01:16:41.335
The door...
we never fixed it.

1115
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:44.271
He was never safe.

1116
01:16:46.841 --> 01:16:49.143
No! No!

1117
01:16:50.311 --> 01:16:51.779
Oh, my God.

1118
01:17:18.405 --> 01:17:21.075
Dash, we need to go now!

1119
01:17:23.410 --> 01:17:26.013
Dash, we need
to get out of here!

1120
01:18:19.962 --> 01:18:24.962
