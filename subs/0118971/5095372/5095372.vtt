1
00:00:45.247 --> 00:00:46.566
Go on, Barbara.

2
00:00:49.447 --> 00:00:52.120
We go back
to our homeroom for dismissal.

3
00:00:52.447 --> 00:00:55.166
Unless you have a pass
for sports or something.

4
00:00:58.007 --> 00:01:00.521
And is that what you did
on the day in question?

5
00:01:00.647 --> 00:01:04.037
No. Mr. Gettys asked me
to stay after class.

6
00:01:04.367 --> 00:01:06.198
What happened next, Barbara?

7
00:01:06.367 --> 00:01:09.120
He told me to sit in the chair
beside his desk.

8
00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:10.061
Barbara...

9
00:01:10.087 --> 00:01:13.523
If you will, in your own words,
tell us exactly what happened

10
00:01:13.607 --> 00:01:15.359
in the next few minutes.

11
00:01:15.967 --> 00:01:18.435
I told him I was afraid
I'd miss my bus.

12
00:01:18.527 --> 00:01:22.202
He promised I'd get to the bus on time
if I'd help him to do something.

13
00:01:23.047 --> 00:01:27.165
Then, before I could say anything, put...
he placed his hand inside my blouse.

14
00:01:28.127 --> 00:01:32.086
I was so frightened. I didn't move.
I thought if I was just quiet it'd be okay.

15
00:01:32.167 --> 00:01:35.796
Then his other hand went up
under inside my skirt.

16
00:01:36.807 --> 00:01:38.904
And then, with his hand

17
00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:41.441
he started moving back and forth

18
00:01:41.647 --> 00:01:44.286
farther and farther inside my skirt.

19
00:01:44.487 --> 00:01:47.763
He said he was testing to see
if I had any special feelings

20
00:01:47.847 --> 00:01:50.759
that he wanted to see
what kind of feelings I had.

21
00:01:50.847 --> 00:01:53.680
I was trying to think of something
to say, but I couldn't.

22
00:01:53.767 --> 00:01:55.917
I was confused,
and he just kept on.

23
00:01:56.007 --> 00:01:58.282
I asked him to stop,
but it was like he couldn't hear me.

24
00:01:58.367 --> 00:02:00.801
He just kept on with his hand.

25
00:02:01.687 --> 00:02:03.006
Then I screamed.

26
00:02:03.127 --> 00:02:06.722
Then he got mad and said
we'd have to try it again sometime.

27
00:02:06.807 --> 00:02:08.160
Did he try again?

28
00:02:08.887 --> 00:02:10.320
Not with me.

29
00:02:10.807 --> 00:02:12.365
But with your friends?

30
00:02:12.727 --> 00:02:14.001
Yes.

31
00:02:14.727 --> 00:02:18.083
And after you had told them
what he had done to you

32
00:02:19.607 --> 00:02:22.883
they told you
what he had done to them!

33
00:02:24.887 --> 00:02:26.206
Isn't that true?

34
00:02:26.327 --> 00:02:27.442
Yes.

35
00:02:30.487 --> 00:02:32.079
I have nothing further.

36
00:02:34.567 --> 00:02:36.637
Your own witness, mr. Lomax.

37
00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:46.317
Any chance, Your Honor,
for a short recess?

38
00:02:46.407 --> 00:02:47.601
Of course.

39
00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:50.361
This court will be in recess
for 15 minutes.

40
00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:56.079
- What...
- Not now, Bernice.

41
00:03:01.847 --> 00:03:03.758
Lomax, what's wrong?

42
00:03:03.927 --> 00:03:06.646
As your attorney, I'm advising you
to keep the fuck away from me!

43
00:03:06.727 --> 00:03:08.638
Why?
What are you talking about?

44
00:03:08.727 --> 00:03:12.242
The wife, the kid, the outrage.
You definitely had me fooled.

45
00:03:12.367 --> 00:03:14.437
Hey, you're my lawyer.

46
00:03:14.767 --> 00:03:15.995
You're here to defend me.

47
00:03:16.087 --> 00:03:17.406
You know what I'm thinking?

48
00:03:17.487 --> 00:03:19.842
Why not put you on the stand?
You can jerk off for the judge.

49
00:03:19.927 --> 00:03:22.725
- You know she's lying.
- Get the hell away from me.

50
00:03:43.047 --> 00:03:44.799
Well, hell, there you are.

51
00:03:46.327 --> 00:03:48.841
Rumor was you were out
wandering in traffic.

52
00:03:49.127 --> 00:03:50.640
Not now, Larry.

53
00:03:50.767 --> 00:03:52.280
What's the game plan, Kevin?

54
00:03:52.567 --> 00:03:55.161
I got a 4:30 deadline.
I need a quote.

55
00:03:55.447 --> 00:03:56.641
Give me a quote.

56
00:03:56.727 --> 00:03:57.716
Fuck off.

57
00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:03.922
"Mr. Lomax had no comment
on today's events."

58
00:04:04.047 --> 00:04:06.766
"Speculation, however,
was widespread"

59
00:04:07.127 --> 00:04:11.040
"that the young lawyer's
unblemished string of victories"

60
00:04:11.367 --> 00:04:12.800
"would come to an end"

61
00:04:12.887 --> 00:04:14.525
"in this courtroom."

62
00:04:19.927 --> 00:04:21.519
It was a nice run, Kev.

63
00:04:21.607 --> 00:04:23.438
Had to close out someday.

64
00:04:24.327 --> 00:04:25.919
Nobody wins them all.

65
00:04:47.047 --> 00:04:50.403
Have you had any discipline
problems in math class this year?

66
00:04:50.887 --> 00:04:52.878
No.

67
00:04:52.967 --> 00:04:53.922
No?

68
00:04:54.887 --> 00:04:58.562
Isn't the truth mr. Gettys had to talk
to you repeatedly about your behavior?

69
00:04:58.647 --> 00:05:01.286
Isn't that why he asked you
to stay after class?

70
00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:02.482
No!

71
00:05:04.967 --> 00:05:07.435
Have other teachers ever
asked you to stay after class?

72
00:05:07.527 --> 00:05:08.676
Once or twice.

73
00:05:08.847 --> 00:05:10.678
Did they want to talk to you
about your behavior?

74
00:05:10.767 --> 00:05:12.325
Objection. Immaterial.

75
00:05:12.407 --> 00:05:14.363
- Goes to motive.
- Overruled.

76
00:05:14.807 --> 00:05:16.638
You may answer the question.

77
00:05:16.967 --> 00:05:18.878
I don't know what
the other teachers wanted.

78
00:05:18.967 --> 00:05:20.719
You'd have to talk to them.

79
00:05:23.007 --> 00:05:25.237
You ever pass notes in class,
Barbara?

80
00:05:27.687 --> 00:05:29.086
Maybe a note that

81
00:05:29.167 --> 00:05:30.964
made fun of mr. Gettys?

82
00:05:31.367 --> 00:05:32.163
No.

83
00:05:32.687 --> 00:05:33.278
No?

84
00:05:33.367 --> 00:05:36.803
Never called him
a "disgusting pig monster"?

85
00:05:38.807 --> 00:05:40.035
Order.

86
00:05:41.207 --> 00:05:42.242
No.

87
00:05:42.727 --> 00:05:45.366
Your Honor, I've pre-marked
this defense exhibit A.

88
00:05:45.447 --> 00:05:48.519
Objection. Your Honor we've had
plenty of time for discovery here.

89
00:05:48.967 --> 00:05:51.686
I'm let this in, mr. Lomax.

90
00:05:51.847 --> 00:05:55.123
I'm also going to suggest
that if you have any other exhibits

91
00:05:55.207 --> 00:05:58.279
you present them in a timely fashion,
or not at all.

92
00:06:00.487 --> 00:06:02.557
I'm sorry, Barbara, I was wrong.

93
00:06:03.287 --> 00:06:05.596
It's "huge hog beast".

94
00:06:06.727 --> 00:06:08.558
This is your handwriting, isn't it?

95
00:06:08.647 --> 00:06:10.797
- Yes, but...
- You wrote this in Gettys' class.

96
00:06:10.887 --> 00:06:11.922
It's a joke.

97
00:06:12.007 --> 00:06:13.918
"He's a huge hog beast."

98
00:06:14.087 --> 00:06:17.682
"He probably eats
a thousand pancakes for breakfast."

99
00:06:19.687 --> 00:06:21.598
You're writing about mr. Gettys,
aren't you?

100
00:06:21.687 --> 00:06:23.598
It was meant to be a joke.

101
00:06:25.927 --> 00:06:28.805
Have you ever had a party
at your house, Barbara

102
00:06:29.127 --> 00:06:30.446
when your parents were away?

103
00:06:30.527 --> 00:06:32.165
Objection.
Your Honor, this is away...

104
00:06:32.387 --> 00:06:33.866
Credibility and bias.

105
00:06:33.947 --> 00:06:35.300
Overruled.

106
00:06:35.607 --> 00:06:37.279
Answer the question.

107
00:06:38.407 --> 00:06:39.362
Yes.

108
00:06:41.127 --> 00:06:44.324
Have you ever heard of a game
called "special places"?

109
00:06:46.567 --> 00:06:48.319
You're under oath, Barbara.

110
00:06:48.407 --> 00:06:50.318
A man's career

111
00:06:50.487 --> 00:06:51.920
his reputation

112
00:06:52.087 --> 00:06:53.759
his life is on the line!

113
00:06:53.847 --> 00:06:55.485
This is not a joke.

114
00:06:55.567 --> 00:06:58.365
Have you ever played
the game "special places"?

115
00:07:04.087 --> 00:07:05.122
Yes.

116
00:07:05.287 --> 00:07:07.676
Is this game sexual in nature?

117
00:07:09.527 --> 00:07:12.366
Is this game sexual in nature?!

118
00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:15.275
We only played it once.

119
00:07:15.927 --> 00:07:18.157
This special party, Barbara

120
00:07:18.567 --> 00:07:22.560
this was the first time you told
the story about mr. Gettys, wasn't it?

121
00:07:23.687 --> 00:07:24.597
Yes.

122
00:07:24.687 --> 00:07:27.679
I've spoken to some other children
who were there that day.

123
00:07:28.087 --> 00:07:30.647
Can you think anything else, Barbara,
they may have told me about the party?

124
00:07:30.727 --> 00:07:33.983
Objection! Your Honor, if he has
other witnesses, let him call them!

125
00:07:34.047 --> 00:07:36.065
If I need to call
those other children, I will!

126
00:07:36.147 --> 00:07:38.820
I'm going to sustain that,
mr. Lomax.

127
00:07:39.287 --> 00:07:40.925
Rephrase your question.

128
00:07:46.207 --> 00:07:48.482
You threatened those children,
didn't you?

129
00:07:48.567 --> 00:07:49.966
That's not the way it happened.

130
00:07:50.047 --> 00:07:54.245
You told them to lie, to falsely claim
that mr. Gettys had hurt them.

131
00:07:54.327 --> 00:07:55.885
These things did happen.

132
00:07:55.967 --> 00:07:57.527
Because if they didn't go along

133
00:07:57.553 --> 00:08:00.429
you were going to tell everyone
about this special party.

134
00:08:00.727 --> 00:08:02.080
They happened to me.

135
00:08:02.167 --> 00:08:04.920
So you made up a story.
A special story.

136
00:08:05.087 --> 00:08:06.645
A story about a math teacher

137
00:08:06.727 --> 00:08:09.241
who was tough on you,
who kept you after class.

138
00:08:09.327 --> 00:08:11.716
A "huge hog beast" you didn't like!

139
00:08:12.007 --> 00:08:14.237
That's what really happened,
isn't it?

140
00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:15.316
No.

141
00:08:15.487 --> 00:08:18.206
I didn't want to be the only one.

142
00:08:19.607 --> 00:08:22.041
You goddamn lowlife,
son of a bitch...

143
00:08:27.767 --> 00:08:29.485
No further questions, Your Honor.

144
00:08:29.567 --> 00:08:31.603
I'm going to adjourn for the day.

145
00:08:32.127 --> 00:08:35.915
We'll be back here at 9:00 a.m.
and people will behave themselves...

146
00:08:36.087 --> 00:08:39.797
- You made me proud.
- ...or find themselves in contempt.

147
00:08:44.407 --> 00:08:46.921
Pack it up, baby.
You need a drink.

148
00:08:49.546 --> 00:08:51.546
You go gale!

149
00:08:52.607 --> 00:08:54.889
In the event that we all
get drunk and forget

150
00:08:54.915 --> 00:08:57.387
I suggest let's front-load
the ceremonial bullshit.

151
00:08:57.527 --> 00:08:59.722
To the best trial lawyer
in Alachua County.

152
00:08:59.807 --> 00:09:01.206
Damn straight.

153
00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:03.998
So, Kev, off the record...

154
00:09:04.287 --> 00:09:06.881
How's it feel to squeeze
a man like Gettys

155
00:09:06.967 --> 00:09:09.356
through the door of reasonable doubt?

156
00:09:09.381 --> 00:09:10.566
Harry...

157
00:09:10.567 --> 00:09:13.479
Why don't you quit being a party pooper.
Have yourself a drink.

158
00:09:13.567 --> 00:09:16.081
We're not going to discuss
the damn case anymore.

159
00:09:16.167 --> 00:09:17.202
Am I right?

160
00:09:17.287 --> 00:09:18.845
I'll drink to that.

161
00:09:20.607 --> 00:09:22.325
No shop talk.

162
00:09:26.647 --> 00:09:28.061
- Pour me another.
- Hey baby!

163
00:09:28.087 --> 00:09:29.486
Lomax, you're wild.

164
00:09:29.927 --> 00:09:32.077

177
00:10:03.281 --> 00:10:04.681
Mr. Lomax!

178
00:10:05.007 --> 00:10:06.486
Hell of a job today.

179
00:10:06.607 --> 00:10:08.723
I don't want to disturb your party.

180
00:10:14.367 --> 00:10:16.756
"Milton-Chadwick-Waters".

181
00:10:17.207 --> 00:10:18.401
Never heard of it.

182
00:10:18.487 --> 00:10:20.717
What are you going to do?
Sue me?

183
00:10:21.367 --> 00:10:24.086
Well, actually, we were hoping
to retain your services.

184
00:10:24.247 --> 00:10:26.317
We've been following your progress.

185
00:10:27.327 --> 00:10:28.555
From New York?

186
00:10:28.887 --> 00:10:30.525
You've never lost a case.

187
00:10:31.607 --> 00:10:33.643
I've had some sympathetic juries.

188
00:10:33.727 --> 00:10:36.002
That's exactly what we're looking for.

189
00:10:36.087 --> 00:10:39.045
We want you to come to New York,
help us pick a jury.

190
00:10:44.247 --> 00:10:45.646
I tell you, man

191
00:10:45.927 --> 00:10:47.804
you're pretty damn good!

192
00:10:48.567 --> 00:10:50.000
Your card is great.

193
00:10:50.167 --> 00:10:51.600
The black tint, you being black...

194
00:10:52.767 --> 00:10:54.485
Whose idea was that? Paul's?

195
00:10:54.567 --> 00:10:56.080
That's just brilliant.

196
00:10:56.247 --> 00:10:58.807
I'm just not drunk enough yet
to fall for it.

197
00:10:59.127 --> 00:11:00.640
I'll buy you a drink when I...

198
00:11:00.727 --> 00:11:02.638
You'd have to start next week.

199
00:11:02.807 --> 00:11:06.720
All expenses, first-class travel
and lodging, you and your wife.

200
00:11:07.287 --> 00:11:11.166
A lump-sum payment, regardless
of the verdict, in the amount of...

201
00:11:14.327 --> 00:11:15.476
Take a look.

202
00:11:34.767 --> 00:11:39.477
In the name of Lord Jesus, we refute you,
satan, and cast you out of this places.

203
00:11:39.847 --> 00:11:40.757
Amen.

204
00:11:40.847 --> 00:11:43.236
'Romans' 16:19

"Be innocent"

207
00:11:49.807 --> 00:11:51.638
"Of evil"

208

"And the God of Peace
will soon crush satan"

209
00:11:55.887 --> 00:11:59.402
"Yes, God will crush him
underneath your feet"

210
00:11:59.967 --> 00:12:03.403
"And the God of Peace
will soon crush satan"

211
00:12:03.727 --> 00:12:07.163
"Yes, God will crush him
underneath your feet"

'Romans' 16:19

213
00:12:19.327 --> 00:12:22.125
All the way to New York
just to pick a jury.

214
00:12:22.287 --> 00:12:24.118
Every dog gets his day.

215
00:12:25.087 --> 00:12:28.841
Why do I feel the hand of Mary Ann
on this adventure?

216
00:12:30.367 --> 00:12:33.518
I gotta tell you, ma,
this routine's getting awful tired.

217
00:12:33.807 --> 00:12:35.399
Working on Sunday.

218
00:12:35.647 --> 00:12:38.036
Working? Ma, get over it.

219
00:12:39.727 --> 00:12:42.138
Ma, listen to me. I love my wife.

220
00:12:42.447 --> 00:12:44.597
Okay? I love her all the way.

221
00:12:45.407 --> 00:12:46.681
Just like you.

222
00:12:47.967 --> 00:12:50.197
Let me tell you about New York.

223
00:12:50.198 --> 00:12:51.221
Let me guess..

224
00:12:51.247 --> 00:12:53.078
"Fallen, fallen, is Babylon."

225
00:12:53.167 --> 00:12:55.965
"It has become
a dwelling place of demons."

226
00:12:56.207 --> 00:12:57.560
'Revelation' 18.

227
00:12:57.727 --> 00:12:59.763
Wouldn't hurt you to look it over.

228
00:13:00.207 --> 00:13:02.721
- Couldn't forget it if I tried.
- Oh, really?

229
00:13:03.647 --> 00:13:05.763
And what happened to Babylon?

230
00:13:07.007 --> 00:13:10.443
"Thou mighty city, in one hour
has thy mighty judgment come."

231
00:13:10.607 --> 00:13:13.963
"And the light of a single lamp
shall shine in thee no more."

232
00:13:16.287 --> 00:13:17.436
Wish me luck.

233
00:13:20.047 --> 00:13:21.162
Good luck.

234
00:13:22.767 --> 00:13:24.485
I'll miss you.

235
00:13:25.407 --> 00:13:28.683
No! Jeannie, listen to me now.
I've gone the extra mile with you on this.

236
00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:30.519
I'm trying to work with you.

237
00:13:30.607 --> 00:13:35.237
They'll be looking for that payment and
if it's not there, they'll repo the car. Ok?

238
00:13:42.207 --> 00:13:43.959
Okay, I gotta go.

239
00:13:46.927 --> 00:13:51.398
Look, Jeannie, I gotta make a plane, ok?
Just get yourself on schedule.

240
00:13:52.007 --> 00:13:53.998
Okay. Make the payment.

241
00:13:58.647 --> 00:14:00.922
Let me guess.
It's all my idea, right?

242
00:14:01.807 --> 00:14:05.038
We better give her some grandkids soon
so I can get her off my back.

243
00:14:05.127 --> 00:14:06.526
What do you say?

244
00:14:08.447 --> 00:14:10.085
Let her sweat a little.

245
00:14:38.687 --> 00:14:42.760
All right, mr. Clintine, let me ask you this:
do you think, as a juror

246
00:14:42.927 --> 00:14:46.203
you'd be able to set aside
any prior opinion you might hold

247
00:14:46.287 --> 00:14:48.562
about the savings and loan industry?

248
00:14:49.487 --> 00:14:50.920
That was a question, sir.

249
00:14:51.007 --> 00:14:52.963
What? Do I like bankers?

250
00:14:58.927 --> 00:15:01.725
Your Honor, may I have a minute
to confer with my colleagues?

251
00:15:01.807 --> 00:15:02.922
You may.

252
00:15:05.807 --> 00:15:07.001
Dump him.

253
00:15:07.167 --> 00:15:09.397
Let's get rid of number four, six...

254
00:15:09.567 --> 00:15:11.159
I'd say lose number twelve

255
00:15:11.247 --> 00:15:13.158
but the prosecutor's gonna fuck up
and do it for us.

256
00:15:13.247 --> 00:15:14.680
Number six?

257
00:15:17.727 --> 00:15:19.843
You're kidding, right?
She's my first choice.

258
00:15:19.927 --> 00:15:21.406
She's my first pass.

259
00:15:21.647 --> 00:15:22.762
And four?

260
00:15:26.367 --> 00:15:29.086
With the dreadlocks?
That's crazy.

261
00:15:29.167 --> 00:15:32.557
- That's a defendant's juror I've ever saw.
- Did you see his shoes?

262
00:15:33.727 --> 00:15:37.640
Look, kid, maybe down in Florida
you are the next big thing.

263
00:15:37.807 --> 00:15:40.879
This is New York, Manhattan.
We're not squeezing oranges here.

264
00:15:41.047 --> 00:15:45.006
He polishes those shoes every night.
He makes his own clothes.

265
00:15:45.407 --> 00:15:50.037
He may look like a brother with an attitude to you,
but I see a man with a shotgun under his bed.

266
00:15:50.207 --> 00:15:53.199
And woe betide the creature
who steps into his garden.

267
00:15:53.567 --> 00:15:55.161
And number six

268
00:15:55.167 --> 00:15:56.680
your favorite

269
00:15:56.847 --> 00:15:58.485
she's damaged goods.

270
00:15:59.087 --> 00:16:01.806
She's a Catholic schoolteacher.

271
00:16:02.287 --> 00:16:04.039
Believes in human frailty...

272
00:16:04.127 --> 00:16:06.357
No. Something's missing from her.

273
00:16:06.447 --> 00:16:07.641
She's wrong.

274
00:16:08.367 --> 00:16:09.880
She wants on this jury.

275
00:16:09.967 --> 00:16:12.356
Somebody hurt her
and she wants revenge.

276
00:16:14.607 --> 00:16:16.677
How the hell do you know that?

277
00:16:17.647 --> 00:16:18.841
I don't know.

278
00:16:20.767 --> 00:16:23.839
Look, either you put a stop
to this happy horseshit or I walk.

279
00:16:25.087 --> 00:16:25.997
Walk.

280
00:16:28.127 --> 00:16:31.756
Here's the deal: if I lose with your jury,
you do the explaining.

281
00:16:32.687 --> 00:16:34.439
Your Honor, may I continue?

282
00:16:34.527 --> 00:16:37.644
We'd like to excuse
Jurors three, four and six.

283
00:17:27.927 --> 00:17:30.646
Hi. You're home early for a change.

284
00:17:34.647 --> 00:17:36.160
Your mother called.

285
00:17:36.727 --> 00:17:38.957
She has her "baaad feeling".

286
00:17:43.367 --> 00:17:45.642
Every now and then,
she gets one right.

287
00:17:48.127 --> 00:17:49.162
You okay?

288
00:17:51.847 --> 00:17:53.200
Something's up.

289
00:17:53.887 --> 00:17:56.640
They deliberated for 38 minutes.

290
00:17:59.341 --> 00:18:01.341
Kevin...

291
00:18:01.367 --> 00:18:03.437
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

292
00:18:05.727 --> 00:18:09.925
Geez... What the hell did they expect?
The man is as guilty as can be.

293
00:18:10.327 --> 00:18:13.046
Wasn't a jury anywhere
gonna let him off.

294
00:18:13.927 --> 00:18:14.962
Yeah.

295
00:18:16.967 --> 00:18:18.082
Except one.

296
00:18:18.487 --> 00:18:19.363
What?

297
00:18:20.688 --> 00:18:22.688
Kev...

298
00:18:24.767 --> 00:18:26.405
Not fucking guilty!

299
00:18:26.927 --> 00:18:30.561
Oh, my God!
You lying sack of shit!

300
00:18:30.647 --> 00:18:32.638
Thirty-eight minutes, my jury!

301
00:18:32.663 --> 00:18:34.663
Yes!

302
00:18:35.127 --> 00:18:36.879
Thirty-eight minutes!

303
00:18:37.247 --> 00:18:39.602
- You did it!
- My jury! I'm too good!

304
00:18:43.607 --> 00:18:46.167
- Glad you could stick around for a couple of days..
- It's your dime.

305
00:18:46.247 --> 00:18:47.316
Sorry to keep you waiting.

306
00:18:47.407 --> 00:18:50.763
But mr. Milton got pinned down
in Indonesia longer than expected.

307
00:18:51.127 --> 00:18:52.640
Good morning, Caprice.

308
00:18:53.207 --> 00:18:54.720
Good morning, mr. Heath.

309
00:18:54.807 --> 00:18:56.035
Your messages.

310
00:18:59.927 --> 00:19:01.121
Not bad?

311
00:19:02.087 --> 00:19:03.679
You can play it cool if you want

312
00:19:03.767 --> 00:19:06.804
but when I first walked in,
my jaw was on the floor.

313
00:19:08.541 --> 00:19:09.841
Thank you.

314
00:19:10.167 --> 00:19:11.202
This is our home office.

315
00:19:11.287 --> 00:19:12.800
But we have quite many
international arrangements

316
00:19:12.887 --> 00:19:15.401
so mr. Milton spends a great deal
of his time in the air.

317
00:19:15.487 --> 00:19:16.920
Three o'clock, we got the Greeks.

318
00:19:17.007 --> 00:19:18.838
So, am I a good cop or a bad cop?

319
00:19:18.927 --> 00:19:20.599
We may not need a good cop.

320
00:19:20.687 --> 00:19:21.756
I love it.

321
00:19:22.367 --> 00:19:26.326
In addition to our corporate clients
we're representing 25 foreign countries:

322
00:19:26.407 --> 00:19:29.365
The Mideast, the Balkans,
Central America, West Africa...

323
00:19:29.447 --> 00:19:31.915
interesting work, but travel-intensive.

324
00:20:25.127 --> 00:20:26.242
Behind you.

325
00:20:27.847 --> 00:20:28.836
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

326
00:20:28.927 --> 00:20:30.645
Please... Kevin Lomax.

327
00:20:31.127 --> 00:20:32.242
John Milton.

328
00:20:32.327 --> 00:20:33.646
Nice to meet you.

329
00:20:39.087 --> 00:20:39.883
So...

330
00:20:40.807 --> 00:20:42.684
Have we been treating you well?

331
00:20:42.767 --> 00:20:43.836
Very well, thank you.

332
00:20:43.927 --> 00:20:45.838
And your wife,
she's had a good time?

333
00:20:45.927 --> 00:20:49.283
She sure has. It's been great.
The whole thing's been great.

334
00:20:51.847 --> 00:20:53.246
That's our secret:

335
00:20:53.527 --> 00:20:55.165
kill you with kindness.

336
00:20:57.607 --> 00:20:59.006
What's your secret?

337
00:20:59.647 --> 00:21:01.080
I couldn't say.

338
00:21:01.527 --> 00:21:02.801
You were a prosecutor.

339
00:21:02.887 --> 00:21:06.436
Out of law school.
Five years in the Jacksonville D.A.'s office.

340
00:21:08.447 --> 00:21:10.722
Sixty-four straight convictions.

341
00:21:12.327 --> 00:21:13.476
What a number!

342
00:21:14.087 --> 00:21:15.679
I like to be in court.

343
00:21:16.007 --> 00:21:17.645
I didn't plea out a lot.

344
00:21:18.647 --> 00:21:19.716
What's that like?

345
00:21:19.807 --> 00:21:22.844
One day you put them away,
the next you set them free.

346
00:21:23.847 --> 00:21:25.405
Takes a little getting used to.

347
00:21:25.487 --> 00:21:27.045
Pays better, though, doesn't it?

348
00:21:27.127 --> 00:21:28.685
Yes, it does.

349
00:21:30.047 --> 00:21:34.484
That math teacher, the Gettys case...
now I hear you were brilliant.

350
00:21:35.207 --> 00:21:36.959
Prosecutor dropped the ball.

351
00:21:37.047 --> 00:21:38.082
Really?

352
00:21:38.807 --> 00:21:40.479
You think your guy was guilty?

353
00:21:40.567 --> 00:21:41.795
I didn't say that.

354
00:21:41.887 --> 00:21:43.115
What'd you say?

355
00:21:44.247 --> 00:21:45.521
How's this:

356
00:21:45.847 --> 00:21:48.839
I began the case
with a clear conscience.

357
00:21:55.847 --> 00:21:57.678
I was sure you had a secret.

358
00:22:01.047 --> 00:22:02.275
The men's room.

359
00:22:02.567 --> 00:22:05.035
Upstairs men's room
in the Duval County courthouse.

360
00:22:05.127 --> 00:22:07.687
There's a hole in the wall
straight to the next room.

361
00:22:07.767 --> 00:22:10.520
I spent five years listening
to juries deliberate.

362
00:22:10.647 --> 00:22:12.365
- I love it.
- Love it all you want.

363
00:22:12.447 --> 00:22:13.675
Just don't repeat it.

364
00:22:13.767 --> 00:22:17.077
I'm not sure the Florida Bar Association
would appreciate it.

365
00:22:17.167 --> 00:22:19.044
My lips are sealed.

366
00:22:19.607 --> 00:22:22.519
You don't really want
to go back to Florida, do you?

367
00:22:26.607 --> 00:22:27.801
Walk with me.

368
00:22:47.487 --> 00:22:48.840
What do you think?

369
00:22:50.047 --> 00:22:51.844
Some people can't handle it.

370
00:22:53.327 --> 00:22:54.521
It's peaceful.

371
00:22:55.847 --> 00:22:57.724
My sentiments exactly.

372
00:22:59.527 --> 00:23:01.219
Fill in the résumé for me.

373
00:23:01.245 --> 00:23:04.043
Tell me, your family...
Your father, what does he do?

374
00:23:04.207 --> 00:23:07.643
I never got to know my father.
He passed away before I was born.

375
00:23:07.807 --> 00:23:10.196
My mother raised me.
Just the two of us.

376
00:23:10.287 --> 00:23:11.561
She never remarried?

377
00:23:11.647 --> 00:23:13.717
She wasn't married the first time.

378
00:23:14.087 --> 00:23:17.045
That can't be easy in a town
like Gainesville, can it?

379
00:23:17.887 --> 00:23:19.923
I don't think it's easy anywhere.

380
00:23:22.207 --> 00:23:23.276
Holy shit!

381
00:23:24.607 --> 00:23:26.518
Different when you're looking down,
isn't it?

382
00:23:26.607 --> 00:23:28.245
Yes, it is.

383
00:23:29.087 --> 00:23:30.406
Oh, my God.

384
00:23:30.847 --> 00:23:31.996
Your mother

385
00:23:32.247 --> 00:23:33.680
what's she like?

386
00:23:34.447 --> 00:23:36.915
She's a preacher's daughter.
She's tough.

387
00:23:37.087 --> 00:23:40.443
She's worked in a poultry plant
for as long as I can remember.

388
00:23:40.567 --> 00:23:44.446
She's got a church she really likes,
so she's usually there or they go out...

389
00:23:44.527 --> 00:23:46.438
They do a lot of volunteer work.

390
00:23:46.527 --> 00:23:50.042
"Behold, I send you out
as sheep amidst the wolves."

391
00:23:51.687 --> 00:23:52.915
So they say.

392
00:23:53.567 --> 00:23:54.841
It didn't rub off?

393
00:23:54.927 --> 00:23:56.599
The Book? The Church?

394
00:23:56.967 --> 00:23:58.525
No, I'm on parole.

395
00:23:58.727 --> 00:24:01.082
Early release for time served.

396
00:24:04.687 --> 00:24:06.962
A lot of potential clients down there.

397
00:24:07.407 --> 00:24:08.840
Are we negotiating?

398
00:24:09.767 --> 00:24:10.802
Always.

399
00:24:12.407 --> 00:24:14.363
Can I ask you a question, then?

400
00:24:15.127 --> 00:24:17.561
Why do you need
a criminal department?

401
00:24:17.807 --> 00:24:21.322
Our clients break the law
like anyone else.

402
00:24:24.527 --> 00:24:27.758
I'm just tired of sending
their business across the street.

403
00:24:28.447 --> 00:24:31.325
- Are you offering me a job?
- I'm thinking about it.

404
00:24:33.047 --> 00:24:36.244
I know you've got talent.
I knew that before you got here.

405
00:24:36.767 --> 00:24:39.964
It's just the other thing
I wonder about.

406
00:24:41.407 --> 00:24:42.922
What thing is that?

407
00:24:44.607 --> 00:24:45.642
Pressure.

408
00:24:46.727 --> 00:24:48.763
It changes everything. Pressure.

409
00:24:49.047 --> 00:24:51.959
Some people, you squeeze them,
they focus.

410
00:24:52.407 --> 00:24:53.726
Others fold.

411
00:24:55.807 --> 00:24:58.037
Can you summon your talent at will?

412
00:24:58.727 --> 00:25:00.604
Can you deliver on a deadline?

413
00:25:01.967 --> 00:25:03.559
Can you sleep at night?

414
00:25:05.047 --> 00:25:06.765
When do we talk about money?

415
00:25:06.847 --> 00:25:07.916
Money?

416
00:25:12.007 --> 00:25:13.520
That's the easy part.

417
00:25:14.487 --> 00:25:16.478
They call this part of Fifth Avenue,
Carnegie Hill.

418
00:25:16.567 --> 00:25:19.286
You've got the park right
across the street, and the reservoir.

419
00:25:19.367 --> 00:25:20.959
Best jogging in New York.

420
00:25:21.047 --> 00:25:22.719
Mount Sinai Hospital is up the street.

421
00:25:22.807 --> 00:25:24.399
Some excellent schools.

422
00:25:25.167 --> 00:25:27.886
Not on the top of mr. Milton's list
when he bought this building

423
00:25:27.967 --> 00:25:30.276
but great neighborhood for children.

424
00:25:30.367 --> 00:25:31.641
Great building.

425
00:25:32.727 --> 00:25:35.116
Follow the money
all the way to the top.

426
00:25:35.287 --> 00:25:38.484
You've got the managing director,
Eddie Barzoon, on 16.

427
00:25:38.647 --> 00:25:41.241
And, of course,
mr. Milton has the tower.

428
00:25:44.407 --> 00:25:46.125
- You must be Mary Ann?
- Yes, I am.

429
00:25:46.207 --> 00:25:48.437
Welcome. I'm Jackie Heath.

430
00:25:49.727 --> 00:25:51.240
It's nice of you to come by.

431
00:25:51.327 --> 00:25:53.522
Oh, please.
We live across the hall.

432
00:25:53.687 --> 00:25:55.564
- You're kidding.
- Right there.

433
00:25:55.967 --> 00:25:57.923
It's just two apartments per floor?

434
00:25:58.007 --> 00:26:01.761
- You didn't tell them about apartment?
- It can speak for itself.

435
00:26:02.967 --> 00:26:04.116
Voilà!

436
00:26:10.007 --> 00:26:11.281
Oh, my God!

437
00:26:12.527 --> 00:26:14.802
It's what they call a "Classic Eight".

438
00:26:15.007 --> 00:26:17.475
Be careful. I don't have a map.
I don't want you to get lost.

439
00:26:17.567 --> 00:26:18.995
We had them paint it white.

440
00:26:19.021 --> 00:26:21.824
Let you see it naked
before you pick your palette.

441
00:26:21.887 --> 00:26:23.081
What am I picking?

442
00:26:23.167 --> 00:26:24.486
Palette. Your colors.

443
00:26:24.567 --> 00:26:25.522
Oh, yes.

444
00:26:28.087 --> 00:26:30.078
I need to warn you about one thing.

445
00:26:30.167 --> 00:26:34.001
There are going to be some
very envious people down at the firm.

446
00:26:34.167 --> 00:26:37.637
There aren't many of these apartments.
They're a really partner's perk.

447
00:26:37.727 --> 00:26:39.922
You must've made
quite an impression.

448
00:26:40.127 --> 00:26:43.722
Oh, my God, three bedrooms.
You know what that means?

449
00:26:44.367 --> 00:26:45.322
Babies.

450
00:26:45.527 --> 00:26:47.643
It took us six years to get in here.

451
00:26:51.647 --> 00:26:53.160
Unbelievable.

452
00:26:55.127 --> 00:26:56.606
Thank you very much.

453
00:26:56.631 --> 00:26:58.631
Jackie.

454
00:27:00.767 --> 00:27:02.678
Are you really this good?

455
00:27:03.567 --> 00:27:05.319
I sure as hell hope so.

456
00:27:06.607 --> 00:27:08.518
They must want you pretty bad.

457
00:27:10.207 --> 00:27:11.401
Look, Mar

458
00:27:12.607 --> 00:27:15.485
I'm only getting behind this
if you're on board.

459
00:27:15.727 --> 00:27:17.399
If you want to go home

460
00:27:18.047 --> 00:27:19.321
I'm with you.

461
00:27:19.607 --> 00:27:20.676
Sure.

462
00:27:21.327 --> 00:27:24.046
Hell, let's go back to Gainesville,
back to the condo.

463
00:27:24.367 --> 00:27:28.406
You can keep scrounging for clients and
I'll keep repossessing cars for Akamian.

464
00:27:28.567 --> 00:27:31.877
And maybe, just maybe,
if we kill ourselves

465
00:27:33.007 --> 00:27:37.319
in about five years we can afford a baby
and a weekend shack at Gulf Shores.

466
00:27:37.847 --> 00:27:39.405
Are you shitting me?

467
00:27:45.007 --> 00:27:46.122
I love you.

468
00:27:46.687 --> 00:27:48.200
I love you, too.

469
00:27:52.047 --> 00:27:54.038
Tadashi Osumi, Media.

470
00:27:54.207 --> 00:27:56.038
Walter Krasna, Maritime Law.

471
00:27:56.727 --> 00:27:58.206
Bashir Toabal, Energy Law.

472
00:27:58.287 --> 00:27:59.959
I run the lslamic subgroup.

473
00:28:00.047 --> 00:28:02.766
Joyce Rensaleer, Mergers
and Acquisitions.

474
00:28:02.927 --> 00:28:05.839
Eddie Barzoon, Managing Director and

475
00:28:06.647 --> 00:28:07.875
Real Estate.

476
00:28:08.007 --> 00:28:10.521
Pradeed Resh, Intellectual Properties.

477
00:28:11.087 --> 00:28:13.965
Christabella Andrioli,
International Trade and Customs

478
00:28:14.047 --> 00:28:15.560
EC and G-7.

479
00:28:17.887 --> 00:28:19.286
There it is, Kevin.

480
00:28:19.647 --> 00:28:20.921
The whole team.

481
00:28:21.367 --> 00:28:24.040
Welcome to Milton,
Chadwick and Waters.

482
00:28:24.407 --> 00:28:26.921
So what do you think?
You can change the furniture if you like.

483
00:28:27.007 --> 00:28:28.565
I guess it'll do.

484
00:28:28.887 --> 00:28:30.366
Until something better comes along?

485
00:28:30.447 --> 00:28:32.199
Kevin Lomax, Pam Garrety.

486
00:28:32.927 --> 00:28:34.280
Nice to meet you.

487
00:28:34.607 --> 00:28:36.643
Pam was at the Brooklyn
D.A.'s office for 14 years

488
00:28:36.727 --> 00:28:38.535
So she knows her way
around the local scene.

489
00:28:38.561 --> 00:28:39.525
She will be your guide.

490
00:28:39.567 --> 00:28:41.637
You gonna be expedite
his New York bar application?

491
00:28:41.727 --> 00:28:44.764
It's in the pipeline.
For now, you'll work pro hac vice.

492
00:28:44.847 --> 00:28:47.281
I petitioned Florida
for a letter of good conduct.

493
00:28:47.367 --> 00:28:51.201
And I prepared, at mr. Milton's request,
an overview of the Moyez case.

494
00:28:51.567 --> 00:28:52.556
The Moyez case?

495
00:28:54.287 --> 00:28:55.720
<i>Move, move, move!</i>

496
00:29:16.287 --> 00:29:17.606
What do you think?

497
00:29:17.687 --> 00:29:20.201
It's a health code case
and it's a loser.

498
00:29:22.327 --> 00:29:23.806
So what's the point?

499
00:29:24.487 --> 00:29:27.638
He wants to see if I'll plea-bargain.
It's a test, right?

500
00:29:28.687 --> 00:29:30.006
Isn't everything?

501
00:29:32.167 --> 00:29:34.601
It's an 18th-century
Italian silk damask

502
00:29:34.687 --> 00:29:38.646
with an embossed floriated pattern
of undulating acanthus leaves.

503
00:29:38.807 --> 00:29:40.160
Lovely, isn't it?

504
00:29:41.927 --> 00:29:43.963
And this is about what?

505
00:29:44.327 --> 00:29:45.362
The price?

506
00:29:46.047 --> 00:29:48.436
It's about $2.000 a panel.

507
00:29:49.647 --> 00:29:50.966
We'll take it

508
00:29:51.567 --> 00:29:52.761
at $1.400.

509
00:29:52.967 --> 00:29:54.605
You made it.

510
00:29:55.206 --> 00:29:56.381
Hey baby.

511
00:29:56.407 --> 00:29:58.602
I thought you said it was impossible.

512
00:29:58.687 --> 00:30:00.837
I thought you said it was important.

513
00:30:08.647 --> 00:30:10.205
Go get them, man!

514
00:30:10.287 --> 00:30:12.517
Tell him "Cut that shit down!"

515
00:30:12.807 --> 00:30:15.685
I know what they're doing over there!
That's right!

516
00:30:16.727 --> 00:30:19.400
Tell him "Take all that noise
back to Africa."

517
00:30:29.047 --> 00:30:31.686
Good afternoon.
I'm looking for Phillipe Moyez.

518
00:30:43.887 --> 00:30:46.355
Look, I'm not sure
I'm making myself clear.

519
00:30:46.447 --> 00:30:49.280
Moyez, you need him?
To speak with him?

520
00:30:50.007 --> 00:30:51.486
Show him your boots.

521
00:30:53.887 --> 00:30:56.447
You're saying he's down here
in the basement?

522
00:30:57.047 --> 00:30:58.082
In the dark?

523
00:30:58.167 --> 00:31:00.237
Where do you think I'm taking you?

524
00:31:08.661 --> 00:31:10.061
Monsieur...

525
00:31:10.087 --> 00:31:12.123
I thought I would recognize you

526
00:31:14.087 --> 00:31:15.361
but I do not.

527
00:31:16.927 --> 00:31:19.162
- Mr. Moyez?
- Oui.

528
00:31:20.127 --> 00:31:21.560
We've never met.

529
00:31:22.367 --> 00:31:24.597
I'm Kevin Lomax. I'm a lawyer.

530
00:31:25.727 --> 00:31:27.479
I'm here about the animals.

531
00:31:29.167 --> 00:31:31.806
We have an investment in blood.

532
00:31:33.727 --> 00:31:35.922
Think of it as spiritual currency.

533
00:31:37.647 --> 00:31:39.319
"Spiritual currency".

534
00:31:41.567 --> 00:31:44.604
Look, mr. Moyez,
I'm going to need your help with this.

535
00:31:49.567 --> 00:31:51.478
What is the name of the man

536
00:31:51.567 --> 00:31:53.239
who will prosecute us?

537
00:31:54.247 --> 00:31:55.236
Merto.

538
00:31:55.727 --> 00:31:58.321
Assistant District Attorney
Arnold Merto.

539
00:32:03.527 --> 00:32:05.404
What are you doing, mr. Moyez?

540
00:32:05.887 --> 00:32:08.685
With this tongue, we create silence.

541
00:32:09.127 --> 00:32:10.355
You can go now.

542
00:32:10.687 --> 00:32:12.518
You will have all the help

543
00:32:12.687 --> 00:32:14.120
I can give you

544
00:32:14.767 --> 00:32:16.678
against monsieur Merto.

545
00:32:24.247 --> 00:32:26.477
It's arbor green.
What do you think?

546
00:32:27.567 --> 00:32:29.205
Not with your complexion.

547
00:32:33.527 --> 00:32:35.438
New York City health codes.

548
00:32:36.087 --> 00:32:37.122
That's all of it?

549
00:32:37.207 --> 00:32:38.356
Not quite.

550
00:32:43.167 --> 00:32:44.395
Thanks.

551
00:32:48.527 --> 00:32:49.926
Caribbean green.

552
00:32:50.687 --> 00:32:52.757
Something cooler, maybe. Cooler.

553
00:32:52.927 --> 00:32:54.155
A cooler green.

554
00:32:58.167 --> 00:32:59.566
Too institutional.

555
00:33:00.287 --> 00:33:01.356
I love green.

556
00:33:01.447 --> 00:33:03.872
You know, I love green
but it's one thing to wear it

557
00:33:03.898 --> 00:33:05.904
and another to have it
on your walls, I mean...

558
00:33:08.727 --> 00:33:12.117
I'm just trying to help.
It's your walls. Do what you want.

559
00:33:15.367 --> 00:33:17.927
Remember,
it's only a health-code case.

560
00:33:17.952 --> 00:33:19.452
Good night.

561
00:33:38.647 --> 00:33:42.606
This is the first time since
I was 13 years old, I don't have a job

562
00:33:43.487 --> 00:33:44.761
or two.

563
00:33:45.327 --> 00:33:47.557
I feel like I'm floating
around in that place.

564
00:33:47.647 --> 00:33:50.207
You know, just drifting around
or something.

565
00:33:52.087 --> 00:33:53.679
You'll settle in.

566
00:33:54.367 --> 00:33:56.801
You know, we had this little office
in the condo...

567
00:33:56.967 --> 00:33:58.036
Thanks.

568
00:33:58.207 --> 00:34:01.404
You know, his side and my side.
Real nice.

569
00:34:02.487 --> 00:34:05.399
At night, I'd go to sleep,
I'd see that light on...

570
00:34:08.247 --> 00:34:09.965
if I want to see Leamon

571
00:34:10.487 --> 00:34:12.125
I make an appointment.

572
00:34:17.367 --> 00:34:18.925
You're kidding, right?

573
00:34:23.727 --> 00:34:25.399
God, how do you handle it?

574
00:34:25.807 --> 00:34:27.763
Take a look around, honey.

575
00:34:28.207 --> 00:34:30.437
Look, you've got three choices.

576
00:34:30.607 --> 00:34:32.199
The Holy Trinity:

577
00:34:33.167 --> 00:34:34.441
you can work

578
00:34:35.647 --> 00:34:37.046
you can play

579
00:34:38.287 --> 00:34:39.686
or you can breed.

580
00:34:40.927 --> 00:34:42.918
That's a veal roast, Your Honor.

581
00:34:43.247 --> 00:34:45.477
USDA approved and stamped.

582
00:34:46.207 --> 00:34:48.675
Men kill animals and eat their flesh.

583
00:34:49.367 --> 00:34:51.244
Phillipe Moyez killed a goat.

584
00:34:52.367 --> 00:34:53.720
He killed a goat.

585
00:34:54.767 --> 00:34:56.598
And he did it at home

586
00:34:57.047 --> 00:35:00.278
in a manner consistent
with his religious beliefs.

587
00:35:00.967 --> 00:35:03.481
Now, mr. Merto may find that bizarre.

588
00:35:04.887 --> 00:35:07.720
It's certainly not a religious practice
performed by everyone.

589
00:35:07.807 --> 00:35:10.367
It's not as common as, say

590
00:35:10.527 --> 00:35:11.846
circumcision.

591
00:35:12.407 --> 00:35:14.443
It's not as common as the belief that

592
00:35:14.527 --> 00:35:16.961
wine transforms into blood.

593
00:35:17.807 --> 00:35:21.163
Some people handle poisonous snakes
to prove their faith.

594
00:35:21.807 --> 00:35:23.718
Some people walk on fire.

595
00:35:24.367 --> 00:35:26.119
Phillipe Moyez killed a goat.

596
00:35:26.207 --> 00:35:27.481
And he did it

597
00:35:28.327 --> 00:35:31.478
while observing
his constitutionally protected

598
00:35:32.047 --> 00:35:33.560
religious beliefs.

599
00:35:35.087 --> 00:35:38.159
Your Honor, this case
is not about keeping goats

600
00:35:38.567 --> 00:35:41.081
or transporting goats
or goat licensing.

601
00:35:42.007 --> 00:35:45.761
The city was clearly less concerned
with the care and feedind of the animals

602
00:35:45.847 --> 00:35:48.122
than the manner in which
they were slaughtered.

603
00:35:48.207 --> 00:35:49.640
Objection!

604
00:35:49.727 --> 00:35:51.558
Enough, enough. I got it.

605
00:35:52.407 --> 00:35:53.760
Let's wrap it up.

606
00:35:54.127 --> 00:35:55.401
Your Honor

607
00:35:56.367 --> 00:35:59.120
the city timed this police action
to catch my client

608
00:35:59.207 --> 00:36:03.166
exercising his constitutionally protected
right to religious freedom.

609
00:36:03.567 --> 00:36:06.001
This is a law protecting
kosher butchering.

610
00:36:06.087 --> 00:36:07.566
Exactly, Your Honor.

611
00:36:07.807 --> 00:36:10.958
I'd like to move at this time
for a verdict of dismissal.

612
00:36:11.087 --> 00:36:14.318
I happen to know a little bit
about kashrut law, mr. Lomax.

613
00:36:14.727 --> 00:36:16.479
I'm aware of that, Your Honor.

614
00:36:16.567 --> 00:36:19.559
That's why I feel confident
in requesting a dismissal.

615
00:36:21.167 --> 00:36:22.236
Mr. Merto?

616
00:36:24.061 --> 00:36:25.561
Your Hon...

617
00:36:25.686 --> 00:36:27.086
Mr. Merto?

618
00:36:28.447 --> 00:36:30.085
For God's sake, man...

619
00:36:37.487 --> 00:36:39.557
- Congratulations. Great job.
- Thanks!

620
00:36:40.047 --> 00:36:43.981
Bravo! Bravo!

621
00:36:44.047 --> 00:36:45.958
Pamela, you look lovely.

622
00:36:46.447 --> 00:36:47.675
So, Phillipe

623
00:36:47.767 --> 00:36:48.916
satisfied?

624
00:36:49.007 --> 00:36:50.520
Always, Jean.

625
00:36:50.521 --> 00:36:51.961
Kev...

626
00:36:52.487 --> 00:36:54.284
What can I say?

627
00:36:55.087 --> 00:36:56.440
Outstanding.

628
00:36:57.567 --> 00:37:00.240
Go figure it, a guy like Moyez

629
00:37:00.607 --> 00:37:02.996
living in some subterranean shithole

630
00:37:03.087 --> 00:37:06.682
all the while he's walking around
with $15 million in the banking account

631
00:37:07.007 --> 00:37:08.201
You're kidding.

632
00:37:08.447 --> 00:37:10.915
What do you think he's paying us in?
Goat's blood?

633
00:37:11.007 --> 00:37:14.636
Hey Tarzan, we're billing you out
at $400 an hour, my friend.

634
00:37:14.807 --> 00:37:18.197
I don't see a whole lot of pro-bono work
in your immediate future.

635
00:37:18.287 --> 00:37:21.324
I figured you came down
to make sure I didn't fuck this up.

636
00:37:21.407 --> 00:37:22.681
Maybe I did.

637
00:37:23.367 --> 00:37:26.564
Don't get too cocky, my boy.
No matter how good you are

638
00:37:26.767 --> 00:37:29.486
don't let them see you coming.
That's the gaffe, my friend.

639
00:37:29.567 --> 00:37:31.637
You've gotta keep yourself small.

640
00:37:31.847 --> 00:37:32.882
Innocuous.

641
00:37:33.167 --> 00:37:34.520
Be the little guy.

642
00:37:34.607 --> 00:37:36.598
You know, the nerd, the leper

643
00:37:37.007 --> 00:37:39.316
the shitkicking surfer.
Look at me.

644
00:37:41.567 --> 00:37:43.717
Underestimated me from day one.

645
00:37:44.607 --> 00:37:47.917
You'd never think I was
a master of the universe, would you?

646
00:37:48.887 --> 00:37:51.720
That's your only weakness,
as far as I can see.

647
00:37:51.887 --> 00:37:53.002
What's that?

648
00:37:53.447 --> 00:37:54.641
It's the look.

649
00:37:55.207 --> 00:37:56.435
That Florida stud thing.

650
00:37:56.527 --> 00:37:57.676
What is that?

651
00:37:57.927 --> 00:38:01.283
Excuse me, ma'am.
Did I leave my boots under your bed?

652
00:38:01.647 --> 00:38:03.638
Never worked a jury
that didn't have a woman.

653
00:38:03.727 --> 00:38:05.558
You know what you're missing?

654
00:38:05.727 --> 00:38:07.445
You're missing what I have.

655
00:38:08.247 --> 00:38:12.035
There's this beautiful girl,
just fucked me 40 ways from Sunday

656
00:38:12.367 --> 00:38:15.757
we're done, she's walking
to the bathroom, she's trying to walk

657
00:38:15.927 --> 00:38:17.155
she turns

658
00:38:17.847 --> 00:38:19.041
she looks

659
00:38:19.567 --> 00:38:20.682
it's me.

660
00:38:21.447 --> 00:38:24.519
Not the Trojan army that just fucked her.
Little old me.

661
00:38:25.527 --> 00:38:27.324
She gets this look on her face like:

662
00:38:27.407 --> 00:38:29.318
"How the hell did that happen?"

663
00:38:31.567 --> 00:38:33.876
I'm the hand up Mona Lisa's skirt.

664
00:38:34.847 --> 00:38:36.360
I'm a surprise, Kevin.

665
00:38:37.087 --> 00:38:38.725
They don't see me coming.

666
00:38:39.047 --> 00:38:40.605
That's what you're missing.

667
00:38:40.687 --> 00:38:42.200
Where's the chicken?

668
00:38:54.527 --> 00:38:59.123
There's a chicken, plays tic-tac-toe,
never loses. He's famous.

669
00:39:01.447 --> 00:39:03.005
Never loses, like you.

670
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:05.030
Tic-tac-toe!

671
00:39:05.247 --> 00:39:07.397
Come on. I'll show you
the fastest way uptown.

672
00:39:07.487 --> 00:39:09.557
Learn the subways, Kevin.

673
00:39:10.647 --> 00:39:11.716
Use them.

674
00:39:12.047 --> 00:39:13.719
Stay in the trenches.

675
00:39:14.607 --> 00:39:16.040
Only way I travel.

676
00:39:17.065 --> 00:39:18.465
Mar?

677
00:39:23.247 --> 00:39:24.999
Mar, what happened to the green?

678
00:39:25.327 --> 00:39:27.402
- I loved the green!
- Honey, you're late!

679
00:39:27.487 --> 00:39:30.206
We're due up at the Barzoon's palace
in 15 minutes.

680
00:39:30.287 --> 00:39:31.959
What's all this?

681
00:39:32.127 --> 00:39:33.162
All what?

682
00:39:33.247 --> 00:39:36.922
Jackie says the "who's who"
of New York powers is gonna be there tonight.

683
00:39:37.247 --> 00:39:39.397
- All this?
- Oh, that.

684
00:39:40.127 --> 00:39:42.038
It was going to be a nursery

685
00:39:42.487 --> 00:39:45.445
then I remembered you'd have to be home
long enough to knock me up.

686
00:39:45.527 --> 00:39:48.246
So now I'm thinking of building
a law library.

687
00:39:48.607 --> 00:39:50.120
Oh, baby.

688
00:39:53.567 --> 00:39:55.159
Tell me I can handle this.

689
00:39:55.247 --> 00:39:56.760
You can handle this.

690
00:39:57.007 --> 00:39:59.123
- Say something nice.
- Something nice.

691
00:40:02.767 --> 00:40:05.964
Promise me you won't
leave me alone in there.

692
00:40:06.607 --> 00:40:07.926
I promise.

693
00:40:12.527 --> 00:40:14.404
There you are!

694
00:40:17.967 --> 00:40:19.923
Diana Barzoon. Eddie's wife.

695
00:40:20.087 --> 00:40:21.520
Nice to meet you.
Sorry we're late.

696
00:40:21.847 --> 00:40:24.725
Kevin Lomax, Health Code Warrior.

697
00:40:25.047 --> 00:40:26.002
All hail.

698
00:40:26.087 --> 00:40:29.159
- Mr. Barzoon, this is Mary Ann.
- Nice to meet you.

699
00:40:29.687 --> 00:40:31.598
Well, Kevin, here they are.

700
00:40:32.087 --> 00:40:35.443
Top of the food chain
and dinner is served.

701
00:40:35.607 --> 00:40:37.120
I throw these parties twice a year.

702
00:40:37.207 --> 00:40:41.723
Stock market, real estate, politics.
They're all players, and they're all prospects.

703
00:40:42.427 --> 00:40:43.842
Kevin, congratulations.

704
00:40:43.927 --> 00:40:45.658
Remember Rashid?
Just in from Beirut.

705
00:40:45.747 --> 00:40:47.141
- Of course.
- Congratulations.

706
00:40:47.227 --> 00:40:49.163
Bright young lights.

707
00:40:50.447 --> 00:40:52.438
You're going to like this.
Come on.

708
00:40:52.527 --> 00:40:54.916
Somebody I want you to meet.

709
00:40:55.087 --> 00:40:58.284
Kevin and Mary Ann Lomax,
this is senator Alfonse D'Amato.

710
00:40:58.447 --> 00:41:00.165
Ambassador Charles Gagano.

711
00:41:00.247 --> 00:41:03.364
In case you didn't know,
these are the Republicans of New York.

712
00:41:03.447 --> 00:41:05.677
You know, Barzoon
always overstates things.

713
00:41:06.087 --> 00:41:08.941
Donald Trump was supposed to be here,
but he had a business emergency.

714
00:41:10.607 --> 00:41:13.405
I knew I'd find you here.
I'd like you to meet my wife.

715
00:41:13.487 --> 00:41:14.840
Mary Ann, this is Pam Garrety.

716
00:41:14.927 --> 00:41:16.645
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

717
00:41:16.727 --> 00:41:19.036
- We're partners in crime.
- Kevin, someone you must meet.

718
00:41:19.127 --> 00:41:20.958
Excuse me Mar. This is important.

719
00:41:21.047 --> 00:41:23.686
- You are so beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

720
00:41:24.487 --> 00:41:26.717
- I heard you met the senator.
- Yes, I did.

721
00:41:26.807 --> 00:41:28.160
- I was married to him.
- Really?

722
00:41:28.247 --> 00:41:29.362
Kidding.

723
00:41:33.327 --> 00:41:35.887
I'd like you to meet Kevin Lomax.
Kevin is from Florida.

724
00:41:35.967 --> 00:41:37.285
He's new to the firm.

725
00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:38.406
Kevin, is nice to meet you

726
00:41:38.407 --> 00:41:40.123
The senator cannot leave.

727
00:41:40.887 --> 00:41:42.718
Who's that with the senator?

728
00:41:44.047 --> 00:41:46.197
- Oh, God, girl.
- You haven't met him yet?

729
00:41:46.287 --> 00:41:47.481
No, who is he?

730
00:41:48.047 --> 00:41:50.003
I swear he can hear us.

731
00:41:50.167 --> 00:41:52.044
Hell, he can smell us.

732
00:41:52.527 --> 00:41:54.260
Mary Ann...

733
00:41:54.647 --> 00:41:55.682
John Milton.

734
00:41:55.767 --> 00:41:58.839
I was hoping I'd see you here tonight.
And here you are.

735
00:41:58.927 --> 00:42:00.997
Already swimming with the sharks.

736
00:42:01.167 --> 00:42:02.680
Careful, honey.

737
00:42:03.807 --> 00:42:07.595
Oh Harry, if you keep thinking small,
we'll never make any money on you.

738
00:42:07.727 --> 00:42:09.399
These parties
don't come cheap, you know.

739
00:42:09.487 --> 00:42:12.160
Call him. Talk to him.
See what they have to say.

740
00:42:12.247 --> 00:42:14.317
Just get it on tape.

741
00:42:15.487 --> 00:42:18.160
Well, you know, It's a wonderful
opportunity for Kevin.

742
00:42:18.767 --> 00:42:21.440
Yes, Kevin.
He's going to do all right if he...

743
00:42:22.327 --> 00:42:24.363
buys a few new suits

744
00:42:25.207 --> 00:42:28.040
learns a few new tricks, he's there.

745
00:42:28.967 --> 00:42:30.286
It's you. What about you?

746
00:42:30.367 --> 00:42:32.835
Your family, you've got
to miss them. No?

747
00:42:35.087 --> 00:42:39.126
I told Kevin the only thing worse
than not having a father was having mine.

748
00:42:40.327 --> 00:42:41.476
I can relate.

749
00:42:43.087 --> 00:42:44.839
I can, believe me.

750
00:42:53.327 --> 00:42:55.079
The worst vice is advice.

751
00:42:58.167 --> 00:43:00.044
But may I make a suggestion?

752
00:43:01.047 --> 00:43:03.117
It's a sensitive...

753
00:43:04.527 --> 00:43:07.246
It's about your hair,
that's why I ask.

754
00:43:07.927 --> 00:43:09.804
No, go ahead.

755
00:43:10.527 --> 00:43:12.245
I mean, you don't like it?

756
00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:13.326
No.

757
00:43:13.327 --> 00:43:15.363
I like it fine. It's beautiful.

758
00:43:16.047 --> 00:43:17.321
It's just...

759
00:43:18.607 --> 00:43:20.245
it doesn't belong to you.

760
00:43:21.047 --> 00:43:22.878
You're too alive for a perm.

761
00:43:23.247 --> 00:43:24.566
It's not you.

762
00:43:25.487 --> 00:43:27.398
You should pull your hair back.

763
00:43:29.807 --> 00:43:31.604
Do it. See what happens.

764
00:43:31.767 --> 00:43:34.235
Right now, here, you want me
to pull my hair back?

765
00:43:34.327 --> 00:43:35.760
Is that so terrible?

766
00:43:36.687 --> 00:43:38.405
I'd love to do it, but if I did

767
00:43:38.487 --> 00:43:41.240
everyone in this room
who's pretending not to be watching us

768
00:43:41.327 --> 00:43:44.717
would naturally assume
that we were fucking or something.

769
00:43:48.047 --> 00:43:49.162
Please.

770
00:43:53.927 --> 00:43:54.962
Okay.

771
00:44:05.127 --> 00:44:06.640
It's fun to be right.

772
00:44:09.807 --> 00:44:10.876
Excuse me.

773
00:44:13.127 --> 00:44:14.480
That's a vision.

774
00:44:16.887 --> 00:44:18.639
You've gotta cut your hair.

775
00:44:21.367 --> 00:44:22.686
Are you serious?

776
00:44:23.087 --> 00:44:26.716
A woman's shoulders
are the frontlines of her mystique.

777
00:44:28.687 --> 00:44:29.915
And her neck

778
00:44:31.767 --> 00:44:33.246
if she's alive

779
00:44:35.047 --> 00:44:37.436
has all the mystery of a border town.

780
00:44:39.687 --> 00:44:41.564
A no man's land

781
00:44:43.927 --> 00:44:45.360
in that battle

782
00:44:45.527 --> 00:44:47.916
between the mind and the body.

783
00:44:49.767 --> 00:44:50.882
You know

784
00:44:52.047 --> 00:44:54.163
your natural color would really

785
00:44:54.247 --> 00:44:55.999
bring out your eyes.

786
00:45:10.487 --> 00:45:12.000
Do you have this view?

787
00:45:12.967 --> 00:45:14.002
Sorry?

788
00:45:14.727 --> 00:45:17.002
From your terrace, is this your view?

789
00:45:17.767 --> 00:45:19.120
Not exactly.

790
00:45:19.847 --> 00:45:21.599
No terrace and I'm about

791
00:45:22.007 --> 00:45:23.599
twelve floors down.

792
00:45:24.327 --> 00:45:25.555
What about you?

793
00:45:26.447 --> 00:45:28.085
No, I live downtown.

794
00:45:29.367 --> 00:45:30.482
This is a

795
00:45:30.807 --> 00:45:32.206
family building.

796
00:45:33.367 --> 00:45:34.720
Sounds like fun.

797
00:45:36.807 --> 00:45:38.126
Downtown, I mean.

798
00:45:38.887 --> 00:45:40.957
I'm just getting to know the city.

799
00:45:41.527 --> 00:45:43.438
Is it everything you expected?

800
00:45:44.087 --> 00:45:45.042
More.

801
00:45:45.287 --> 00:45:48.484
I say we ride them as far as we can,
and then eat them.

802
00:45:49.607 --> 00:45:52.485
Excuse me, Jackie.
Have you guys seen Kevin anywhere?

803
00:45:52.567 --> 00:45:54.444
No, I'm sure he's around.

804
00:45:54.469 --> 00:45:56.169
Okay, thanx.

805
00:45:57.327 --> 00:45:58.680
Are you alone?

806
00:46:01.927 --> 00:46:03.280
You mean, tonight?

807
00:46:05.927 --> 00:46:07.883
Is your wife a jealous woman,
mr. Lomax?

808
00:46:14.007 --> 00:46:16.726
Oh, dear, I'm going
to scare you away.

809
00:46:17.967 --> 00:46:19.082
No. No, really

810
00:46:19.167 --> 00:46:20.282
I'm fine.

811
00:46:20.307 --> 00:46:21.086
Yeah?

812
00:46:21.087 --> 00:46:22.122
I'm fine.

813
00:46:22.207 --> 00:46:23.720
Bet you like to be on top.

814
00:46:23.807 --> 00:46:25.957
- Don't you?
- Excuse me?

815
00:46:26.647 --> 00:46:28.239
Of the situation.

816
00:46:28.647 --> 00:46:31.036
You prefer to be on top, right?

817
00:46:32.767 --> 00:46:34.246
Depends on the view.

818
00:46:37.207 --> 00:46:38.720
You know what I see?

819
00:46:40.647 --> 00:46:42.046
I see the future

820
00:46:42.847 --> 00:46:44.280
of this law firm.

821
00:47:00.887 --> 00:47:03.242
We need to talk, Kevin.
Something's come up.

822
00:47:03.327 --> 00:47:06.922
But first I want you to find
Heath and Eddie Barzoon.

823
00:47:08.247 --> 00:47:10.761
Bring them up to my place.
Do it quietly.

824
00:47:10.927 --> 00:47:11.882
Quickly.

825
00:47:13.927 --> 00:47:16.487
No problem. Arnold has
a few reporters in his pocket.

826
00:47:16.567 --> 00:47:18.762
We'll plant a story
and destroy his credibility.

827
00:47:18.847 --> 00:47:20.200
Pam, have you seen Kevin?

828
00:47:20.287 --> 00:47:22.198
- No, I haven't, sweetie.
- Okay.

829
00:47:23.447 --> 00:47:25.915
If he doesn't come to us,
he'll regret it.

830
00:47:45.767 --> 00:47:46.722
Come on.

831
00:47:58.407 --> 00:47:59.840
Is there more to it?

832
00:48:00.887 --> 00:48:02.240
Just this room.

833
00:48:03.447 --> 00:48:05.199
And a bedroom?

834
00:48:06.367 --> 00:48:08.082
Nope. No bedroom.

835
00:48:08.567 --> 00:48:10.717
- Where does he sleep?
- Who says he sleeps?

836
00:48:10.807 --> 00:48:12.001
Where does he fuck?

837
00:48:12.087 --> 00:48:13.202
Everywhere!

838
00:48:15.967 --> 00:48:17.241
What's up, John?

839
00:48:17.527 --> 00:48:20.485
Leamon, how many hours did we bill
Alex Cullen for last year?

840
00:48:22.887 --> 00:48:24.798
16.242.

841
00:48:24.967 --> 00:48:26.366
What the fuck did he do now?

842
00:48:27.127 --> 00:48:30.517
Alex Cullen has just been charged
with murdering his wife

843
00:48:31.367 --> 00:48:32.686
her stepson

844
00:48:32.967 --> 00:48:34.161
and a maid.

845
00:48:36.807 --> 00:48:38.035
When did this happen?

846
00:48:38.127 --> 00:48:39.606
Just now. Tonight.

847
00:48:39.967 --> 00:48:42.686
I've sent Pam downtown
to make bail arrangements.

848
00:48:42.967 --> 00:48:45.217
They're gonna fucking crucify him.
They're gonna...

849
00:48:45.247 --> 00:48:48.125
They're gonna line up!
I gotta call Meisel.

850
00:48:48.247 --> 00:48:50.761
No! No! No!
I want Kevin on this case.

851
00:48:52.727 --> 00:48:54.240
I hope you're kidding.

852
00:48:57.847 --> 00:49:02.398
Alexander Cullen in a Manhattan
triple murder with, excuse me, Kevin?

853
00:49:03.287 --> 00:49:04.561
You're dreaming!

854
00:49:07.047 --> 00:49:09.197
You know, I've shaken hands

855
00:49:09.367 --> 00:49:12.564
with every marquee
defense attorney in this town.

856
00:49:12.887 --> 00:49:15.276
I'd take Kevin and I don't look back.

857
00:49:16.167 --> 00:49:18.965
John, you've got
a great eye for talent.

858
00:49:19.047 --> 00:49:23.245
You know, you're the master, but you know,
I... I just don't see this happening.

859
00:49:23.927 --> 00:49:25.645
I want you on board, Eddie.

860
00:49:27.007 --> 00:49:31.603
I appreciate the vote of confidence,
but maybe Eddie has a point here.

861
00:49:31.967 --> 00:49:34.527
We can get this case.
The man's our client.

862
00:49:35.007 --> 00:49:36.998
He's a business client.

863
00:49:37.487 --> 00:49:39.637
We know him better
than he knows himself.

864
00:49:39.727 --> 00:49:41.638
We've got the inside track.

865
00:49:41.967 --> 00:49:44.745
We've got the best damn
trial lawyer in the city.

866
00:49:44.771 --> 00:49:46.126
It's ours to lose.

867
00:49:48.647 --> 00:49:50.126
Tell that to Cullen.

868
00:49:50.927 --> 00:49:52.599
I want Kevin to tell him.

869
00:49:53.127 --> 00:49:54.719
There's Pam!

870
00:49:57.487 --> 00:49:59.876
You gonna fight for this thing or not?

871
00:50:07.567 --> 00:50:08.522
Pam?

872
00:50:09.007 --> 00:50:10.235
No, it's Kevin.

873
00:50:12.327 --> 00:50:14.921
No, it's okay. I'm on it.
Yeah, I'm on it.

874
00:50:15.367 --> 00:50:16.686
Where are we at?

875
00:50:23.727 --> 00:50:25.160
You left me there.

876
00:50:27.207 --> 00:50:30.722
I had a fucking panic attack
until Jackie told me where you were.

877
00:50:31.527 --> 00:50:33.563
Three hours!
You don't even call!

878
00:50:33.647 --> 00:50:34.557
Stop.

879
00:50:35.007 --> 00:50:36.042
Reset.

880
00:50:36.847 --> 00:50:39.884
I'm upstairs. I'm with Milton,
Heath and Barzoon.

881
00:50:40.167 --> 00:50:41.757
There's a very good possibility

882
00:50:41.783 --> 00:50:44.151
that I'm about to catch
a triple homicide defendant

883
00:50:44.207 --> 00:50:45.560
who also happens to be

884
00:50:45.647 --> 00:50:48.798
one of the largest
real-estate developers in this city.

885
00:50:50.167 --> 00:50:51.885
Mar, I had to bail on the party.

886
00:50:52.007 --> 00:50:53.884
You bailed on me.

887
00:50:55.809 --> 00:50:56.909
Mar!

888
00:50:57.047 --> 00:50:59.356
- Did you hear me?
- I was all by myself!

889
00:50:59.527 --> 00:51:01.085
For three whole hours.

890
00:51:01.167 --> 00:51:04.000
The next time you make a promise,
try and keep it!

891
00:51:04.327 --> 00:51:05.760
You gotta be kidding me, right?

892
00:51:05.847 --> 00:51:09.044
Go to hell. And you can go to sleep
on the fucking couch!

893
00:51:12.487 --> 00:51:15.399
- You sure he's up there?
- Yeah, CNN passed the word.

894
00:51:16.007 --> 00:51:17.156
Look at this.

895
00:51:17.287 --> 00:51:20.597
I'm not out 20 minutes, and I'm being
followed by the goddamn press.

896
00:51:20.647 --> 00:51:22.075
They're like insects down there.

897
00:51:22.167 --> 00:51:24.556
Alex, just calm down
and listen, okay?

898
00:51:26.727 --> 00:51:30.800
I don't know. Maybe you're right.
Maybe he is a whiz kid, but Jesus Christ!

899
00:51:31.167 --> 00:51:33.442
This is my ass
we're talking about John!

900
00:51:33.467 --> 00:51:34.006
Eddie!

901
00:51:34.007 --> 00:51:37.443
Alex, you know how this town works.

902
00:51:39.847 --> 00:51:42.486
You've got enemies here
you haven't heard from.

903
00:51:44.047 --> 00:51:45.400
Now, with this

904
00:51:45.927 --> 00:51:47.645
now that you're down

905
00:51:47.807 --> 00:51:49.525
I'd get ready for one of those

906
00:51:49.607 --> 00:51:52.041
Class-A, New York-style pigfucks.

907
00:51:52.847 --> 00:51:54.041
You know what's coming.

908
00:51:54.127 --> 00:51:57.156
Now you're going to have to ask yourself
"who do you trust?"

909
00:51:57.181 --> 00:51:58.646
Who do you trust, Alex?

910
00:51:58.647 --> 00:51:59.875
I don't know.

911
00:52:00.007 --> 00:52:01.884
I'm gonna have to look around.

912
00:52:05.447 --> 00:52:07.563
You don't have time to shop,
mr. Cullen.

913
00:52:07.647 --> 00:52:11.196
Jury selection started this morning
at every breakfast table in the city.

914
00:52:11.367 --> 00:52:13.119
This is what people know:

915
00:52:13.607 --> 00:52:15.086
three dead bodies.

916
00:52:15.607 --> 00:52:17.165
You discover the crime.

917
00:52:17.247 --> 00:52:21.126
You call it in. You've got blood
on your person and clothes.

918
00:52:22.567 --> 00:52:23.966
And mr. Cullen...

919
00:52:25.447 --> 00:52:27.119
Your prints are on the murder weapon.

920
00:52:27.207 --> 00:52:28.720
How do you know that?

921
00:52:29.287 --> 00:52:31.755
There's a second print in blood.

922
00:52:31.887 --> 00:52:35.323
It's a partial of a hand on the wall
next to the bodies.

923
00:52:35.407 --> 00:52:37.988
I have keys.
I called the cops from the house!

924
00:52:38.014 --> 00:52:40.846
I touched the goddamn wall!
I panicked! I was panicked!

925
00:52:40.927 --> 00:52:42.997
We need 12 people
who can see past all that.

926
00:52:43.087 --> 00:52:46.079
- I touched the goddamn wall!
- I'd get in front of this fast.

927
00:52:46.167 --> 00:52:48.362
I panicked! Is that a crime?

928
00:52:49.207 --> 00:52:50.959
I didn't kill anybody.

929
00:52:52.687 --> 00:52:54.120
This is a nightmare.

930
00:52:54.727 --> 00:52:57.605
How am I going to convince anybody?
I'm innocent.

931
00:52:59.327 --> 00:53:00.806
He's right, Alex.

932
00:53:01.127 --> 00:53:03.118
People need to hear these things.

933
00:53:03.207 --> 00:53:04.686
Christ, Eddie.

934
00:53:05.367 --> 00:53:07.927
You're not happy tomorrow?
The next day?

935
00:53:08.647 --> 00:53:10.046
We'll move over.

936
00:53:10.247 --> 00:53:12.363
But right now, this moment

937
00:53:12.567 --> 00:53:15.127
you need immediate representation.

938
00:53:15.207 --> 00:53:17.118
I have a 14-year-old stepdaughter

939
00:53:17.207 --> 00:53:19.767
who I care more about
than anything in this world.

940
00:53:19.847 --> 00:53:22.441
They wouldn't let me talk to her
from downtown.

941
00:53:22.687 --> 00:53:24.837
They won't let me talk to her
now that I'm out!

942
00:53:24.927 --> 00:53:27.487
We need to issue a statement.

943
00:53:29.567 --> 00:53:31.000
He's a winner, Alex.

944
00:53:31.327 --> 00:53:32.965
Just like you were.

945
00:53:33.127 --> 00:53:35.277
And they'll never see him coming.

946
00:53:37.407 --> 00:53:39.238
Jesus Christ.

947
00:53:42.207 --> 00:53:45.244
I've got some tough phone calls
I've got to...

948
00:53:52.687 --> 00:53:54.166
My place, tomorrow.

949
00:53:54.487 --> 00:53:55.476
Alone.

950
00:53:59.647 --> 00:54:03.242
You better be every fucking inch
as good as he says you are.

951
00:54:12.367 --> 00:54:14.323
Not if they were giving it away.

952
00:54:14.647 --> 00:54:17.115
Come on, Mary Ann.
Let's check out Yoshi's.

953
00:54:18.447 --> 00:54:19.482
- Andrea?
- Yes?

954
00:54:19.567 --> 00:54:20.966
Another one of these, please.

955
00:54:21.047 --> 00:54:22.196
Right away.

956
00:54:22.447 --> 00:54:24.517
- No, no, no!
- Yes, yes, yes, yes!

957
00:54:25.247 --> 00:54:27.886
I want you loose
and pliable this afternoon.

958
00:54:30.807 --> 00:54:32.877
Oh, Lord, this is $3.000.

959
00:54:33.967 --> 00:54:35.525
You know what you should do?

960
00:54:35.607 --> 00:54:37.086
You should buy it

961
00:54:37.527 --> 00:54:40.200
wear it once,
and then throw it away.

962
00:54:40.567 --> 00:54:42.205
That will loosen you up.

963
00:54:44.047 --> 00:54:45.446
I say spend it all.

964
00:54:45.847 --> 00:54:49.965
If you never see your husband,
have a relationship with his money.

965
00:54:50.047 --> 00:54:51.321
I swear

966
00:54:51.487 --> 00:54:55.639
if Eddie wasn't afraid of me
shouting my mouth off

967
00:54:55.807 --> 00:54:58.446
he would've put a cellulite clause
in the pre-nup.

968
00:54:58.527 --> 00:55:00.563
Dr. Robert, I'm telling you

969
00:55:00.727 --> 00:55:03.321
he's a miracle man.
You've seen my new tits.

970
00:55:03.487 --> 00:55:05.239
Who does it better than that?

971
00:55:05.327 --> 00:55:07.477
It's not my tits I'm worried about.

972
00:55:09.887 --> 00:55:11.320
Not too big...

973
00:55:12.327 --> 00:55:13.555
Perfect.

974
00:55:14.767 --> 00:55:15.882
Real or not?

975
00:55:18.367 --> 00:55:19.595
They look real.

976
00:55:20.447 --> 00:55:21.960
They must be real.

977
00:55:23.687 --> 00:55:24.881
Feel them.

978
00:55:24.967 --> 00:55:26.286
No, it's okay, really.

979
00:55:26.367 --> 00:55:29.200
Go ahead. That's the ultimate test.
Come on.

980
00:55:32.527 --> 00:55:33.562
Feel real?

981
00:55:33.847 --> 00:55:35.326
Yes, absolutely real.

982
00:55:36.287 --> 00:55:37.720
Dr. Robert.

983
00:55:41.087 --> 00:55:42.440
When you're ready.

984
00:56:04.887 --> 00:56:07.162
So, what do you think?

985
00:56:09.967 --> 00:56:13.676
I don't care if they can hear me.
I don't care!

986
00:56:14.767 --> 00:56:16.917
I don't like it here, Kevin.

987
00:56:17.087 --> 00:56:20.318
And these women! My God, I mean,
I'm seeing things for Christ's sake!

988
00:56:20.407 --> 00:56:22.602
- You just left them in the store?
- Yes!

989
00:56:22.687 --> 00:56:24.086
- Calm down!
- No!

990
00:56:24.247 --> 00:56:25.396
Listen to me!

991
00:56:25.421 --> 00:56:27.421
Mar! Mar!

992
00:56:27.447 --> 00:56:28.596
First...

993
00:56:30.327 --> 00:56:32.636
You do this radical thing
to your hair.

994
00:56:33.047 --> 00:56:34.082
You hate it.

995
00:56:34.167 --> 00:56:35.600
Stop. I think it's fine.

996
00:56:35.727 --> 00:56:39.436
I think it's fine.
But I also think it's traumatic.

997
00:56:41.047 --> 00:56:44.119
You've got the pressure
of fitting in with new friends.

998
00:56:44.407 --> 00:56:45.965
A new place.

999
00:56:46.527 --> 00:56:49.261
- Add to that a couple bottles of wine.
- No!

1000
00:56:49.327 --> 00:56:51.966
No. It wasn't the wine, Kevin.

1001
00:56:52.287 --> 00:56:55.597
It wasn't the wine, or my hair,
or talking to Kathy

1002
00:56:55.687 --> 00:56:57.040
or anything like that!

1003
00:56:57.127 --> 00:56:59.641
Because I know
that's what you're gonna say.

1004
00:56:59.887 --> 00:57:01.286
What about Kathy?

1005
00:57:01.447 --> 00:57:03.085
What about your sister?

1006
00:57:03.327 --> 00:57:05.602
What about her?
She's pregnant again.

1007
00:57:06.527 --> 00:57:08.597
That's got nothing to do with this?

1008
00:57:11.727 --> 00:57:14.195
Kevin, I never see you anymore.

1009
00:57:15.087 --> 00:57:18.921
And now that you've got this big case,
it's just only gonna get worse.

1010
00:57:19.367 --> 00:57:20.682
If you can believe it

1011
00:57:20.767 --> 00:57:24.521
I'm actually looking forward
to having your mother come and visit.

1012
00:57:24.607 --> 00:57:26.006
What about the apartment?

1013
00:57:26.087 --> 00:57:27.600
Goddamn you!

1014
00:57:27.687 --> 00:57:29.757
Why do you always
have to change things around?

1015
00:57:29.847 --> 00:57:33.396
This is not about the apartment!
I hate this stupid place!

1016
00:57:35.327 --> 00:57:36.396
You know

1017
00:57:37.087 --> 00:57:39.396
you buy a couple new suits
and you're fine.

1018
00:57:39.487 --> 00:57:40.966
It's a little more than that.

1019
00:57:41.047 --> 00:57:43.277
I have this whole
fucking place to fill!

1020
00:57:43.367 --> 00:57:47.246
I know we have all this money
and it's supposed to be fun, but it's not!

1021
00:57:47.527 --> 00:57:51.486
It's like a test.
The whole thing is like one big test.

1022
00:57:51.727 --> 00:57:53.558
And God...!

1023
00:58:02.127 --> 00:58:04.277
I am so lonely!

1024
00:58:05.567 --> 00:58:07.683
I miss you so much.

1025
00:58:08.447 --> 00:58:09.880
I'm sorry, baby.

1026
00:58:10.527 --> 00:58:12.916
I don't know what to do.

1027
00:58:15.407 --> 00:58:16.806
Let's make a baby.

1028
00:58:21.487 --> 00:58:22.806
Don't tease me.

1029
00:58:22.967 --> 00:58:24.366
I wouldn't do that.

1030
00:58:25.167 --> 00:58:26.646
Not unless you asked.

1031
00:58:31.487 --> 00:58:33.159
Oh, baby.

1032
00:58:55.247 --> 00:58:56.839
Do you have this view?

1033
00:59:29.887 --> 00:59:31.206
Make love to me.

1034
01:00:13.687 --> 01:00:15.086
What are you doing?

1035
01:00:43.807 --> 01:00:44.956
Stop.

1036
01:00:46.487 --> 01:00:47.442
Oh, God.

1037
01:00:48.767 --> 01:00:49.563
God!

1038
01:00:49.647 --> 01:00:50.966
Where are you?

1039
01:00:51.807 --> 01:00:53.035
I'm right here.

1040
01:00:54.847 --> 01:00:56.360
No, you're not.

1041
01:01:03.087 --> 01:01:07.000
- Why do we have to keep going?
- Because it needs to be clear, mr. Cullen.

1042
01:01:07.167 --> 01:01:10.842
Because I need to know
and understand exactly

1043
01:01:11.007 --> 01:01:12.360
what happened.

1044
01:01:12.927 --> 01:01:15.805
You're standing there, you look down

1045
01:01:16.447 --> 01:01:17.880
there's the gun.

1046
01:01:18.767 --> 01:01:20.758
I don't know why I picked it up.

1047
01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:23.646
It was before I saw Elucinda's body.

1048
01:01:24.527 --> 01:01:26.438
You kneeled down to pick it up?

1049
01:01:27.887 --> 01:01:31.163
You work late, you come home,
you walk in, everybody's dead!

1050
01:01:31.247 --> 01:01:32.760
It's not something you plan for!

1051
01:01:32.847 --> 01:01:34.758
Stop. Back up.

1052
01:01:36.607 --> 01:01:38.120
Two prints by the gun.

1053
01:01:39.647 --> 01:01:40.796
"Right hand".

1054
01:01:41.607 --> 01:01:43.006
"Right knee".

1055
01:01:44.287 --> 01:01:45.561
Right knee.

1056
01:01:46.127 --> 01:01:47.480
We've been over this.

1057
01:01:47.567 --> 01:01:49.239
I'm trying to picture it.

1058
01:01:49.407 --> 01:01:50.442
Your hand

1059
01:01:50.527 --> 01:01:52.358
your hand came from

1060
01:01:53.607 --> 01:01:56.326
inside and underneath?

1061
01:01:58.367 --> 01:02:01.643
Do you want to see it?
Here. I'll fucking show you.

1062
01:02:11.087 --> 01:02:13.555
See? Did you see it?
Was it clear?

1063
01:02:13.967 --> 01:02:15.082
You got it?

1064
01:02:15.207 --> 01:02:16.560
Whose gun is that?

1065
01:02:16.847 --> 01:02:19.236
- It's mine!
- Are you out of your mind?

1066
01:02:19.487 --> 01:02:22.684
You're charged with a triple homicide,
you're walking around with a damn gun!

1067
01:02:22.767 --> 01:02:24.997
I have had nine death threats!

1068
01:02:25.087 --> 01:02:27.078
Give it over.
Now, give me the gun.

1069
01:02:27.807 --> 01:02:29.160
I gotta protect myself.

1070
01:02:29.247 --> 01:02:33.320
That's my job. When the case is over,
you can have it back.

1071
01:02:36.207 --> 01:02:38.243
This is a deal breaker, Alex.

1072
01:02:49.141 --> 01:02:51.141
Okey.

1073
01:02:51.167 --> 01:02:52.282
Let's wrap it up.

1074
01:02:52.367 --> 01:02:53.686
So, what's next?

1075
01:02:54.447 --> 01:02:57.166
We need to talk to your assistant,
mrs. Black.

1076
01:02:57.327 --> 01:02:58.316
Okey, call her.

1077
01:02:58.647 --> 01:03:01.286
You feel confident
she'll back you on the time?

1078
01:03:02.807 --> 01:03:04.718
Melissa, yeah, yeah.

1079
01:03:04.887 --> 01:03:07.401
She's okay.
She's a straight arrow.

1080
01:03:09.647 --> 01:03:11.717
So, we're going to talk to her

1081
01:03:12.807 --> 01:03:15.799
and you're not going
to talk to anybody, all right?

1082
01:03:17.007 --> 01:03:18.042
All right?

1083
01:03:21.327 --> 01:03:22.476
No comment.

1084
01:03:25.687 --> 01:03:26.915
There they are!

1085
01:03:29.127 --> 01:03:30.958
Hey Kevin, how about a couple shots?

1086
01:03:31.047 --> 01:03:33.845
How does it feel to get
the biggest murder trial in New York?

1087
01:03:33.927 --> 01:03:37.317
Look over here! Are you really
going to plead Cullen not guilty?

1088
01:03:37.407 --> 01:03:38.760
What is happening?

1089
01:03:38.847 --> 01:03:41.759
Since the case,
Kevin's picture's been in the paper.

1090
01:03:42.207 --> 01:03:45.040
He always did like to stick
his nose in the camera.

1091
01:03:46.127 --> 01:03:47.938
- Sorry about that, mrs. Lomax
- No problem.

1092
01:03:48.007 --> 01:03:50.104
How you doing mrs. Lomax?
Did you have a nice dinner?

1093
01:03:50.127 --> 01:03:52.322
Oh, I surely did. Are you hungry?

1094
01:03:52.407 --> 01:03:54.079
Oh, no, ma'am. Thank you.

1095
01:03:54.967 --> 01:03:56.480
Welcome to Babylon, ma.

1096
01:03:56.567 --> 01:03:58.000
Speak of the devil.

1097
01:04:00.047 --> 01:04:02.641
I was just telling them
the Moyez story.

1098
01:04:03.287 --> 01:04:04.436
Really?

1099
01:04:05.527 --> 01:04:06.676
This is your mother.

1100
01:04:06.767 --> 01:04:08.280
Yes, mom, this is...

1101
01:04:08.447 --> 01:04:09.596
John Milton.

1102
01:04:11.087 --> 01:04:12.315
Alice Lomax.

1103
01:04:12.727 --> 01:04:14.843
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1104
01:04:15.687 --> 01:04:17.040
How do you do?

1105
01:04:17.065 --> 01:04:19.065
Mary Ann...

1106
01:04:19.647 --> 01:04:21.603
- You're looking lovely.
- Thanks.

1107
01:04:22.501 --> 01:04:24.501
This is...

1108
01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:26.245
I believe you met Christabella.

1109
01:04:26.327 --> 01:04:27.760
Yes, I think we did.

1110
01:04:27.887 --> 01:04:29.366
And Gizelle.

1111
01:04:29.527 --> 01:04:31.438
Fresh in from Paris.

1112
01:04:31.527 --> 01:04:33.324
Great.

1113
01:04:34.167 --> 01:04:35.486
Nice to meet you.

1114
01:04:37.687 --> 01:04:39.120
Three for you

1115
01:04:39.287 --> 01:04:40.640
and my place.

1116
01:04:40.727 --> 01:04:44.077
- Thanks for the champagne, John
- You're very welcome, Kevin.

1117
01:04:45.647 --> 01:04:49.640
This isn't really your first visit
to New York, now, is it, mrs. Lomax?

1118
01:04:53.047 --> 01:04:53.877
Yes.

1119
01:05:01.007 --> 01:05:04.636
You've done one hell of a job
bringing him up, mrs. Lomax.

1120
01:05:05.527 --> 01:05:06.562
And I'm sure

1121
01:05:06.647 --> 01:05:08.239
it wasn't easy.

1122
01:05:10.767 --> 01:05:11.916
No.

1123
01:05:14.927 --> 01:05:16.440
Mom, we're here.

1124
01:05:16.547 --> 01:05:18.200
Yes. Good night to you.

1125
01:05:19.247 --> 01:05:21.317
Good night, Mary Ann.

1126
01:05:21.807 --> 01:05:23.286
Kevin, hang on.

1127
01:05:25.127 --> 01:05:26.924
How about Cullen? How's it going?

1128
01:05:27.007 --> 01:05:28.406
Everything on beam?

1129
01:05:28.647 --> 01:05:30.444
That's a long conversation.

1130
01:05:31.167 --> 01:05:32.964
Want to come up and tell me?

1131
01:05:33.207 --> 01:05:34.322
Now?

1132
01:05:41.807 --> 01:05:43.240
Let's talk tomorrow.

1133
01:05:45.967 --> 01:05:47.002
You sure?

1134
01:05:47.027 --> 01:05:49.027
Yeah.

1135
01:05:56.487 --> 01:05:59.365
Is that what you're doing
when you're working late?

1136
01:05:59.607 --> 01:06:00.926
What're you talking about?

1137
01:06:01.007 --> 01:06:03.202
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

1138
01:06:03.287 --> 01:06:05.278
- That's ridiculous.
- Yeah, right.

1139
01:06:05.527 --> 01:06:06.721
I'm going to bed.

1140
01:06:06.807 --> 01:06:08.638
- Good night, Alice.
- 'Night.

1141
01:06:21.687 --> 01:06:23.439
Oh, shit!

1142
01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:27.381
Mom!

1143
01:06:27.407 --> 01:06:28.760
Mom, what are you doing?

1144
01:06:28.847 --> 01:06:30.380
I'm going home, Kevin.

1145
01:06:30.447 --> 01:06:32.119
What? What are you talking about?

1146
01:06:32.207 --> 01:06:34.277
I don't feel right.

1147
01:06:34.447 --> 01:06:36.677
Look, you just got here.

1148
01:06:37.487 --> 01:06:41.162
And I just got my teeth kicked in
on the front page, so I gotta run.

1149
01:06:42.127 --> 01:06:43.799
We'll talk later, okay?

1150
01:06:43.824 --> 01:06:45.824
Okay?

1151
01:06:48.847 --> 01:06:50.678
I have to go, Kevin.

1152
01:06:51.247 --> 01:06:52.600
I miss my church.

1153
01:06:52.847 --> 01:06:56.886
Mom, this is New York. There must be
20.000 churches. Take your pick.

1154
01:06:57.967 --> 01:07:00.083
You need to do a better job
with Mary Ann.

1155
01:07:00.167 --> 01:07:01.725
She is not well.

1156
01:07:01.807 --> 01:07:04.526
- This place is not good for her, Kevin
- So stay.

1157
01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:06.837
Take care of her,
if you're so concerned.

1158
01:07:06.927 --> 01:07:08.246
Help me out.

1159
01:07:08.687 --> 01:07:10.723
I'll take her home if you let me.

1160
01:07:11.167 --> 01:07:13.317
This is home. Understand?

1161
01:07:13.487 --> 01:07:14.761
This is where we live.

1162
01:07:14.847 --> 01:07:16.917
I'm not going back to Gainesville.

1163
01:07:17.007 --> 01:07:18.599
Unbelievable!

1164
01:07:19.487 --> 01:07:20.636
"Wide is the gate"

1165
01:07:20.727 --> 01:07:23.639
"and broad is the way
that leadeth to temptation."

1166
01:07:23.967 --> 01:07:25.480
It's a little early for Scripture.

1167
01:07:25.567 --> 01:07:28.286
I'm going to work.
You can do whatever you want.

1168
01:07:51.007 --> 01:07:52.918
Does my babysitter have to testify?

1169
01:07:53.007 --> 01:07:56.044
We need her to establish
the time you returned home.

1170
01:07:56.527 --> 01:07:59.087
She doesn't have a green card,
is why I ask.

1171
01:07:59.567 --> 01:08:01.683
I would hate for her
to get in trouble.

1172
01:08:01.767 --> 01:08:04.049
Tell you what, Melissa...
Let's talk to her first.

1173
01:08:04.075 --> 01:08:06.302
See where she stands
and take it from there.

1174
01:08:06.367 --> 01:08:08.627
I'll make sure
Melissa gets down to the car.

1175
01:08:08.652 --> 01:08:09.206
Thanks Pam.

1176
01:08:09.207 --> 01:08:11.337
Mr. Cullen didn't kill those people.

1177
01:08:11.407 --> 01:08:14.365
I know him. He's a difficult man,
but he couldn't kill anyone.

1178
01:08:14.447 --> 01:08:16.642
That's why we're all working so hard.

1179
01:08:17.567 --> 01:08:18.602
Thank you.

1180
01:08:20.047 --> 01:08:22.515
Can I have the car stop
at my ex-husband's?

1181
01:08:22.927 --> 01:08:25.077
- My son left his jacket there.
- Sure.

1182
01:08:29.167 --> 01:08:32.064
George, remember, no shredding
in the building trash.

1183
01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:33.843
- Only in the private refuse.
- Yes sir.

1184
01:08:33.887 --> 01:08:36.845
Excelsior Securities,
who's handling that?

1185
01:08:37.007 --> 01:08:39.077
- I am.
- All this has got to go.

1186
01:08:39.407 --> 01:08:41.477
Guatemala, Sudan, Cyprus...

1187
01:08:41.478 --> 01:08:43.461
Mark! No, no, no!

1188
01:08:43.487 --> 01:08:46.923
Vagada Holdings, it'll take you all night.
Just Vagada Holdings.

1189
01:08:48.847 --> 01:08:51.315
I thought I was the only one
working late.

1190
01:08:54.367 --> 01:08:55.402
So did we.

1191
01:08:56.367 --> 01:08:59.006
Back to work.
This is not a break.

1192
01:08:59.207 --> 01:09:00.196
Good news.

1193
01:09:00.287 --> 01:09:03.245
We just wrapped up with Cullen's assistant.
She looks like a great alibi.

1194
01:09:03.327 --> 01:09:04.965
What a pleasant surprise.

1195
01:09:07.887 --> 01:09:09.718
Looks like you've got your hands full.

1196
01:09:09.807 --> 01:09:11.877
It's just a little...

1197
01:09:12.087 --> 01:09:13.406
housekeeping.

1198
01:09:14.127 --> 01:09:15.799
If anyone should ask

1199
01:09:16.767 --> 01:09:18.280
you never saw this.

1200
01:09:18.687 --> 01:09:19.881
Who would ask?

1201
01:09:21.047 --> 01:09:22.036
Weaver.

1202
01:09:22.167 --> 01:09:23.282
Who's that?

1203
01:09:24.447 --> 01:09:26.756
Justice Department.
Weaver Commission.

1204
01:09:29.167 --> 01:09:30.361
You don't know about Weaver?

1205
01:09:30.447 --> 01:09:31.482
Sorry.

1206
01:09:33.167 --> 01:09:34.202
How nice for you.

1207
01:09:34.287 --> 01:09:36.859
Grab your coat, mr. Lomax.
The night is young.

1208
01:09:36.885 --> 01:09:38.908
We're going to the Garden.
Ringside.

1209
01:09:39.087 --> 01:09:40.202
Title fight.

1210
01:09:40.287 --> 01:09:41.800
Roy Jones, jr.

1211
01:09:41.887 --> 01:09:43.605
I have to call Mary Ann.

1212
01:09:43.687 --> 01:09:45.006
Do it on the way.

1213
01:09:46.967 --> 01:09:48.195
Get my message?

1214
01:09:48.447 --> 01:09:50.756
I did. You write beautifully.

1215
01:09:54.447 --> 01:09:56.517
What's this Weaver Commission?

1216
01:09:56.847 --> 01:09:58.724
I don't like to micro-manage.

1217
01:09:58.887 --> 01:10:00.843
Find the talent, then delegate.

1218
01:10:01.407 --> 01:10:03.682
Who the hell knows
what Eddie's up to?

1219
01:10:04.127 --> 01:10:06.766
He's got a lot of fingers
in a lot of pies.

1220
01:10:07.647 --> 01:10:08.841
Excuse me.

1221
01:10:09.007 --> 01:10:11.077
What the fuck are you looking at?

1222
01:10:12.047 --> 01:10:13.958
You. You deaf or something?
You don't hear me?

1223
01:10:14.047 --> 01:10:15.639
I hear you fine.

1224
01:10:15.807 --> 01:10:17.879
So get the fuck out of my car
if you hear me fine.

1225
01:10:17.967 --> 01:10:21.606
Why? I didn't know it was your car.
I'm having a good time here.

1226
01:10:21.687 --> 01:10:23.279
I'm not asking you, motherfucker

1227
01:10:23.367 --> 01:10:24.716
I'm telling you
get the fuck out of my car...

1228
01:10:24.807 --> 01:10:25.737
Shit. John!

1229
01:10:25.767 --> 01:10:28.122
Get out before I cut
your fucking throat.

1230
01:10:28.187 --> 01:10:29.222
Fuck that.

1231
01:10:53.367 --> 01:10:54.686
How do you know?

1232
01:10:59.607 --> 01:11:00.756
Enjoy yourself.

1233
01:11:00.847 --> 01:11:02.326
You still got time.

1234
01:11:02.807 --> 01:11:05.765
There's a train coming the other way.
You'll just catch it.

1235
01:11:05.847 --> 01:11:07.758
You'll thank me in the morning.

1236
01:11:07.887 --> 01:11:09.115
If you ain't right...

1237
01:11:09.207 --> 01:11:10.322
I'm right.

1238
01:11:10.487 --> 01:11:11.556
You'll see.

1239
01:11:13.167 --> 01:11:14.486
Invigorating.

1240
01:11:15.407 --> 01:11:17.045
What did you say to him?

1241
01:11:18.127 --> 01:11:19.966
I told him if he didn't leave us alone

1242
01:11:19.992 --> 01:11:22.126
you'd gonna kick his ass
from here to Caldbeck.

1243
01:11:22.127 --> 01:11:25.164
Look, there's a lady getting up
from her seat. Come on.

1244
01:11:26.607 --> 01:11:29.326
Give it to him!
You want this round? You are on!

1245
01:11:30.127 --> 01:11:33.005
Roy's gonna get him.
Now, now, now!

1246
01:11:42.927 --> 01:11:44.076
Fixed!

1247
01:11:49.807 --> 01:11:52.196
- What a beauty!
- I'm glad you could come, man!

1248
01:11:52.887 --> 01:11:56.323
I want you to meet my new heavyweight,
here: Kevin Lomax.

1249
01:11:56.487 --> 01:11:57.806
Kevin Lomax! How are you?

1250
01:11:57.967 --> 01:11:58.956
I'm well.

1251
01:12:17.327 --> 01:12:18.760
And say what?

1252
01:12:18.927 --> 01:12:20.883
He's the senior partner at the...

1253
01:12:23.247 --> 01:12:25.522
Mar, you're really starting
to piss me off.

1254
01:12:34.447 --> 01:12:36.358
Yes, I'm having one cigarette.

1255
01:12:36.527 --> 01:12:39.883
You want me to lie?
One cigarette after seven months is not...

1256
01:12:40.047 --> 01:12:42.003
That's exactly what I'm saying!

1257
01:12:43.767 --> 01:12:45.485
Go to bed. I have no idea.

1258
01:12:56.047 --> 01:12:58.436
Mar stop! This guy pays our bills.

1259
01:12:58.607 --> 01:13:02.236
The food, the heat, the rent on that
enormous fucking apartment we live in.

1260
01:13:03.407 --> 01:13:04.886
I live there, too.

1261
01:13:05.911 --> 01:13:07.011
Mar?

1262
01:13:09.647 --> 01:13:11.239
Give it back to me!

1263
01:13:15.001 --> 01:13:16.101
Kevin!

1264
01:13:17.527 --> 01:13:18.721
Babs Coleman.

1265
01:13:19.087 --> 01:13:20.566
Kevin Lomax.

1266
01:13:20.647 --> 01:13:23.525
Babs is from Georgia Tech.
It's your neck of the woods.

1267
01:13:23.607 --> 01:13:24.596
There's Tiffany.

1268
01:13:24.687 --> 01:13:27.155
New additions.
Where are you from?

1269
01:13:27.287 --> 01:13:28.879
Don't tell me!

1270
01:13:29.807 --> 01:13:30.956
Michigan!

1271
01:13:31.447 --> 01:13:34.166
How'd you know? Oh, my goodness!

1272
01:13:34.327 --> 01:13:35.726
How did he know?

1273
01:13:35.887 --> 01:13:37.366
That is so good.

1274
01:13:51.887 --> 01:13:53.161
Cheers.

1275
01:14:09.986 --> 01:14:11.086
Kevin?

1276
01:14:20.411 --> 01:14:21.511
Honey?

1277
01:14:43.646 --> 01:14:44.920
Hello?

1278
01:14:45.966 --> 01:14:47.285
Who is there?

1279
01:14:48.046 --> 01:14:49.638
I got a knife.

1280
01:15:11.566 --> 01:15:13.079
Oh, Jesus.

1281
01:15:19.726 --> 01:15:21.079
Baby

1282
01:15:21.566 --> 01:15:23.443
how'd you get here?

1283
01:15:25.086 --> 01:15:26.758
Are you okay?

1284
01:15:29.006 --> 01:15:30.280
Oh, God.

1285
01:15:33.406 --> 01:15:35.078
Where's your mommy?

1286
01:15:36.366 --> 01:15:39.483
You ain't got no mommy?
What do you got there?

1287
01:15:39.726 --> 01:15:41.876
What are you playing with?

1288
01:15:43.126 --> 01:15:44.957
What are you playing with?

1289
01:15:51.006 --> 01:15:52.598
Oh, God!

1290
01:16:01.646 --> 01:16:03.238
Baby, please.

1291
01:16:03.526 --> 01:16:05.562
Baby, there is no blood.

1292
01:16:06.286 --> 01:16:08.356
There is no blood.
It was a dream.

1293
01:16:08.446 --> 01:16:09.799
Mar, it was a dream.

1294
01:16:11.086 --> 01:16:13.395
It's not a dream if it's true.

1295
01:16:14.926 --> 01:16:19.204
Look, let's get you undressed
and in the tub, okay?

1296
01:16:19.406 --> 01:16:20.441
No!

1297
01:16:20.846 --> 01:16:22.359
I know you.

1298
01:16:23.966 --> 01:16:26.036
You'll leave me now for sure.

1299
01:16:26.686 --> 01:16:28.916
No! Get away from me!

1300
01:16:32.226 --> 01:16:34.464
Okay. I'm confused.

1301
01:16:34.686 --> 01:16:35.801
Why?

1302
01:16:36.686 --> 01:16:38.039
What is it now?

1303
01:16:40.206 --> 01:16:41.844
Did you like the green?

1304
01:16:42.366 --> 01:16:43.958
You did, didn't you?

1305
01:16:44.126 --> 01:16:45.479
We should go back to the green.

1306
01:16:45.566 --> 01:16:48.285
I'm calling the doctor.
I'm going to get you some help.

1307
01:16:48.366 --> 01:16:50.197
They took my ovaries, Kevin.

1308
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.100
What?

1309
01:16:53.326 --> 01:16:55.556
They took my ovaries!

1310
01:16:55.726 --> 01:16:57.717
I told you! Right here!

1311
01:16:58.126 --> 01:17:01.163
Mary Ann, it was a nightmare.
It didn't happen.

1312
01:17:04.846 --> 01:17:07.963
My sisters have
seven children between them.

1313
01:17:11.006 --> 01:17:13.679
My mother had Derek
when she was 45.

1314
01:17:13.966 --> 01:17:16.400
You could've set a clock
by my periods.

1315
01:17:16.566 --> 01:17:17.555
Baby

1316
01:17:17.886 --> 01:17:20.320
what are you talking about?

1317
01:17:21.886 --> 01:17:24.241
Kevin, I can't have children.

1318
01:17:24.686 --> 01:17:25.641
What?

1319
01:17:26.286 --> 01:17:27.435
Says who?

1320
01:17:30.686 --> 01:17:32.199
The doctor.

1321
01:17:32.846 --> 01:17:34.837
I was there yesterday.

1322
01:17:36.046 --> 01:17:39.038
"Non-specific ovarian failure".

1323
01:17:41.006 --> 01:17:42.359
That's ridiculous.

1324
01:17:45.486 --> 01:17:46.521
Oh, God.

1325
01:17:48.206 --> 01:17:49.844
Did you just hear that?

1326
01:17:50.846 --> 01:17:51.881
Listen.

1327
01:17:53.806 --> 01:17:55.159
Can you hear that?

1328
01:17:58.126 --> 01:17:59.081
No.

1329
01:18:02.926 --> 01:18:05.235
You're going to leave me,
aren't you?

1330
01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:08.700
Mary Ann...

1331
01:18:08.926 --> 01:18:10.518
I know you.

1332
01:18:11.646 --> 01:18:12.681
God...

1333
01:18:15.326 --> 01:18:16.918
No, Kevin.

1334
01:18:17.326 --> 01:18:18.759
It's these monsters.

1335
01:18:19.806 --> 01:18:22.036
I dreamt about this.

1336
01:18:22.946 --> 01:18:24.679
- Listen to me.
- Baby, I gotta take this.

1337
01:18:24.766 --> 01:18:27.155
No, you've gotta listen to me.

1338
01:18:28.706 --> 01:18:30.459
- Why...
- I gotta take this.

1339
01:18:32.286 --> 01:18:33.799
It's going to be okay.

1340
01:18:40.766 --> 01:18:41.721
Fuck!

1341
01:18:41.886 --> 01:18:44.195
I knew the D.A.
was holding out on us.

1342
01:18:44.366 --> 01:18:47.005
Get the discovery package
over here, right now.

1343
01:18:47.806 --> 01:18:49.876
I don't care. Find Cullen.

1344
01:18:58.606 --> 01:19:01.564
I get one supervised hour a week
with my stepdaughter.

1345
01:19:01.726 --> 01:19:04.923
I am in there with two shrinks
and three social workers.

1346
01:19:05.086 --> 01:19:07.805
You better have a goddamn
good reason for calling me out.

1347
01:19:07.886 --> 01:19:10.923
Your wife, the day she was killed,
had lunch with a friend.

1348
01:19:11.006 --> 01:19:14.157
She says, and I quote:
"Alex is fucking around and I can prove it."

1349
01:19:14.246 --> 01:19:17.400
- That's hearsay. That never gets in.
- Wrong answer.

1350
01:19:17.686 --> 01:19:19.802
Your prenuptial agreement's
on file at the firm.

1351
01:19:19.886 --> 01:19:22.446
The contract is null and void
in the event of marital infidelity.

1352
01:19:22.526 --> 01:19:24.756
You fuck around, she gets rich.

1353
01:19:24.926 --> 01:19:27.235
That's a motive, Alex.

1354
01:19:28.206 --> 01:19:29.798
What do I need to know?

1355
01:19:38.046 --> 01:19:39.957
Melissa, my assistant.

1356
01:19:40.926 --> 01:19:42.996
She wasn't even that good a fuck.

1357
01:19:43.246 --> 01:19:44.281
And...

1358
01:19:44.926 --> 01:19:46.757
on the night in question?

1359
01:19:53.966 --> 01:19:57.481
I was boning my assistant
the night my wife got shot.

1360
01:20:02.766 --> 01:20:04.836
I've got to re-interview Melissa.

1361
01:20:05.006 --> 01:20:08.043
No, forget it.
We're not telling that story.

1362
01:20:08.206 --> 01:20:11.403
Juries want honesty.
Fuck with that at your peril.

1363
01:20:14.006 --> 01:20:15.644
Alessandra... Alessandra, wait!

1364
01:20:16.169 --> 01:20:17.569
Alex.

1365
01:20:17.594 --> 01:20:18.485
Alex!

1366
01:20:18.486 --> 01:20:20.204
Not now. Mrs. Skylar, please!

1367
01:20:20.286 --> 01:20:21.924
Time's up, mr. Cullen.

1368
01:20:22.766 --> 01:20:23.516
Alex!

1369
01:20:23.606 --> 01:20:24.834
I can't!

1370
01:20:25.806 --> 01:20:28.366
Mrs. Skylar, this isn't fair.
I had 15 more minutes.

1371
01:20:28.686 --> 01:20:31.246
You'll just have to wait
until next week.

1372
01:20:32.526 --> 01:20:35.120
- Alessandra, I'll see you next week.
- That's it, I'm sorry.

1373
01:20:36.566 --> 01:20:38.158
For sleep.

1374
01:20:38.326 --> 01:20:40.476
And she can take
that during the day?

1375
01:20:40.566 --> 01:20:42.318
No, she won't be driving.

1376
01:20:42.646 --> 01:20:45.365
I'll have the pharmacy
call you right back. Thanks.

1377
01:20:45.646 --> 01:20:49.685
He's not sure. He thinks it could
be some kind of hormonal imbalance.

1378
01:20:49.846 --> 01:20:51.677
I'm taking you off the case.

1379
01:20:51.678 --> 01:20:53.180
What?

1380
01:20:53.206 --> 01:20:54.878
I want you to drop this case.

1381
01:20:54.966 --> 01:20:56.558
This case? Cullen?

1382
01:20:57.206 --> 01:20:59.640
- John, I've got a jury showing up.
- Do you love this woman?

1383
01:20:59.726 --> 01:21:01.921
- Yes, of course I do.
- Then what are you doing?

1384
01:21:02.006 --> 01:21:03.234
She's sick.

1385
01:21:03.406 --> 01:21:06.443
Everyone will understand.
I'll understand.

1386
01:21:06.606 --> 01:21:08.005
What about Cullen?

1387
01:21:08.406 --> 01:21:09.998
We find somebody new.

1388
01:21:10.166 --> 01:21:11.724
You consult.

1389
01:21:11.926 --> 01:21:13.723
You live to fight another day, son.

1390
01:21:13.806 --> 01:21:16.878
What are you talking about?
I put together a great jury.

1391
01:21:17.366 --> 01:21:19.322
It's a disappointment.
I know. We have them.

1392
01:21:19.406 --> 01:21:23.763
All of us have them. You use it.
You embrace it. And then you move on.

1393
01:21:26.166 --> 01:21:27.235
Hang on.

1394
01:21:27.566 --> 01:21:29.079
We've gotta talk about this.

1395
01:21:29.166 --> 01:21:32.363
Listen to yourself, Kevin.
"We've gotta talk about this."

1396
01:21:32.526 --> 01:21:34.118
It's your wife, man!

1397
01:21:34.286 --> 01:21:36.242
She's sick, she needs you.

1398
01:21:36.406 --> 01:21:38.283
She's got to come first.

1399
01:21:38.606 --> 01:21:40.119
All right, wait a minute.

1400
01:21:40.206 --> 01:21:44.358
Do you mean the possibility of leaving
this case has never entered your mind?

1401
01:21:48.726 --> 01:21:50.318
You know what scares me?

1402
01:21:51.086 --> 01:21:53.475
I quit the case, she gets better

1403
01:21:54.326 --> 01:21:55.998
and I hate her for it.

1404
01:21:57.046 --> 01:21:59.845
I don't want to resent her, John.
I've got a winner here.

1405
01:21:59.926 --> 01:22:03.885
I've got to nail this fucker down
and put it behind me. Just get it done.

1406
01:22:04.206 --> 01:22:05.161
Then...

1407
01:22:05.646 --> 01:22:06.715
then

1408
01:22:07.086 --> 01:22:09.042
put all my energy into her.

1409
01:22:15.566 --> 01:22:17.158
I stand corrected.

1410
01:22:18.006 --> 01:22:20.804
So fill me in. Did Cullen's assistant
admit to the affair?

1411
01:22:20.886 --> 01:22:22.922
She did to me, but

1412
01:22:23.086 --> 01:22:24.599
she won't in court.

1413
01:22:25.006 --> 01:22:26.325
Convince her otherwise.

1414
01:22:26.406 --> 01:22:29.159
And when all that evidence
is laid before you

1415
01:22:29.326 --> 01:22:33.319
when all these pieces weave together,
you will conclude

1416
01:22:33.486 --> 01:22:34.885
you will know

1417
01:22:34.966 --> 01:22:37.526
that Alexander Cullen is guilty

1418
01:22:37.686 --> 01:22:39.597
of murdering three people

1419
01:22:39.886 --> 01:22:41.365
in cold blood

1420
01:22:41.646 --> 01:22:43.921
and with malice aforethought.

1421
01:22:44.526 --> 01:22:45.561
Thank you.

1422
01:22:46.886 --> 01:22:47.955
Your Honor.

1423
01:22:49.286 --> 01:22:52.483
We can break for lunch now
or you can do a stop and start.

1424
01:22:52.886 --> 01:22:54.763
If it's a choice, I'll go now,
Your Honor.

1425
01:22:55.086 --> 01:22:57.156
I won't be as long as mr. Broygo.

1426
01:22:57.366 --> 01:22:58.435
Proceed.

1427
01:23:03.446 --> 01:23:05.516
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury

1428
01:23:05.646 --> 01:23:09.321
I know you've spent all morning
listening to mr. Broygo talk.

1429
01:23:09.486 --> 01:23:10.714
I know you're hungry.

1430
01:23:10.806 --> 01:23:13.798
What I need to tell you
won't take very long at all.

1431
01:23:15.086 --> 01:23:17.646
I don't like Alexander Cullen.

1432
01:23:18.606 --> 01:23:20.676
I don't think he's a nice person.

1433
01:23:21.366 --> 01:23:23.277
I don't expect you to like him.

1434
01:23:24.046 --> 01:23:27.083
He's been a terrible husband
to all three of his wives.

1435
01:23:27.246 --> 01:23:30.204
He's been a destructive force
in the lives of his stepchildren.

1436
01:23:30.286 --> 01:23:32.356
He's cheated the city, his partners

1437
01:23:32.446 --> 01:23:33.561
his employees.

1438
01:23:33.646 --> 01:23:37.195
He's paid hundreds of thousands of dollars
in penalties and fines over the years

1439
01:23:37.366 --> 01:23:38.958
I don't like him.

1440
01:23:40.246 --> 01:23:43.921
I'm going to tell you some things
during the course of this trial

1441
01:23:44.046 --> 01:23:46.765
that are going to make you
like him even less.

1442
01:23:48.046 --> 01:23:49.718
But this isn't a popularity contest.

1443
01:23:49.806 --> 01:23:51.285
It's a murder trial.

1444
01:23:52.246 --> 01:23:56.478
And the single most important
provable fact of this proceeding

1445
01:23:57.286 --> 01:24:00.961
is that Alexander Cullen
was somewhere else

1446
01:24:01.206 --> 01:24:02.321
when these

1447
01:24:02.406 --> 01:24:04.874
horrible crimes took place.

1448
01:24:06.486 --> 01:24:07.839
Now, the State...

1449
01:24:08.246 --> 01:24:10.635
The State is going all out here.

1450
01:24:10.886 --> 01:24:12.558
They've got this whole team here

1451
01:24:12.646 --> 01:24:15.206
throwing everything
but the kitchen sink at this case.

1452
01:24:15.286 --> 01:24:16.958
I want one thing from you.

1453
01:24:17.286 --> 01:24:18.480
That's it.

1454
01:24:18.886 --> 01:24:20.001
One thing.

1455
01:24:21.286 --> 01:24:23.516
I want you to ask yourself:

1456
01:24:25.046 --> 01:24:26.957
is not liking this man

1457
01:24:28.806 --> 01:24:30.797
reason enough

1458
01:24:31.206 --> 01:24:33.117
to convict him of murder?

1459
01:24:35.846 --> 01:24:37.279
Enjoy your lunch.

1460
01:24:37.606 --> 01:24:38.959
We'll talk again.

1461
01:24:41.046 --> 01:24:44.083
What the fuck was that about?
They're going to hate me!

1462
01:24:44.446 --> 01:24:47.438
Listen to me like you've never
listen to anyone before in your life.

1463
01:24:47.526 --> 01:24:49.915
I'm gonna bust my ass
to make sure they hate you.

1464
01:24:50.006 --> 01:24:54.079
Because as long as you're boning Melissa,
you're not home killing your wife!

1465
01:24:56.086 --> 01:24:58.236
Why didn't you say something before?

1466
01:24:58.966 --> 01:25:01.036
Then it doesn't look spontaneous.

1467
01:25:03.446 --> 01:25:04.640
You got it now.

1468
01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:17.960
- Hey! Kevin!
- Eddie!

1469
01:25:18.086 --> 01:25:19.360
Saw you go in.

1470
01:25:19.446 --> 01:25:20.481
What's up?

1471
01:25:20.566 --> 01:25:22.318
Well, congratulations.

1472
01:25:22.486 --> 01:25:26.081
- It's not over yet.
- Well, I'm not talking about the trial.

1473
01:25:26.246 --> 01:25:27.440
What are you talking about?

1474
01:25:27.526 --> 01:25:30.882
How the fuck does your name
get on the firm's charter?

1475
01:25:32.166 --> 01:25:33.042
What?

1476
01:25:33.126 --> 01:25:35.003
It looks like it's been there
for years.

1477
01:25:35.086 --> 01:25:37.759
So, now you're a partner.
When did that happen?

1478
01:25:37.926 --> 01:25:41.760
You know, I still am
the managing director of this firm.

1479
01:25:41.926 --> 01:25:43.598
You want my job, take me head on.

1480
01:25:43.686 --> 01:25:45.005
You backdoor me one more time

1481
01:25:45.086 --> 01:25:48.362
and I'll take your partnership papers
and shove them down your throat!

1482
01:25:48.446 --> 01:25:51.722
I don't know what you're talking about.
I sure don't like your tone of voice.

1483
01:25:51.806 --> 01:25:52.841
Bullshit.

1484
01:25:52.926 --> 01:25:54.564
You've got a problem with documents

1485
01:25:54.646 --> 01:25:58.525
I suggest you put together one of your
late-night shredding sessions.

1486
01:26:02.486 --> 01:26:05.080
You think you're tough enough
to run this firm?

1487
01:26:05.846 --> 01:26:08.724
Remember the Weaver Commission
investigation?

1488
01:26:08.886 --> 01:26:10.478
Tell your mentor

1489
01:26:10.646 --> 01:26:13.683
the next time Weaver calls me,
maybe I'll just...

1490
01:26:13.846 --> 01:26:15.325
pick up the phone.

1491
01:26:19.886 --> 01:26:22.002
- Was he drunk?
- I doubt it.

1492
01:26:22.166 --> 01:26:23.645
He was going running.

1493
01:26:24.086 --> 01:26:26.156
What the hell was he talking about?

1494
01:26:27.286 --> 01:26:29.595
Eddie's got himself in trouble again.

1495
01:26:30.406 --> 01:26:33.796
And he wants me to save him.
Only this time, I can't.

1496
01:26:35.606 --> 01:26:37.722
Why does he think I'm after his job?

1497
01:26:38.166 --> 01:26:40.885
You ever have any experience
with manic depression?

1498
01:26:40.966 --> 01:26:42.081
Not directly, no.

1499
01:26:42.166 --> 01:26:43.281
You do now.

1500
01:26:43.366 --> 01:26:44.196
<i>346.</i>

1501
01:26:44.286 --> 01:26:46.117
It's me. Get Eddie Barzoon.

1502
01:26:46.246 --> 01:26:48.999
He may be out running,
so you might have to page him.

1503
01:26:49.086 --> 01:26:50.963
- It's an emergency.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

1504
01:26:51.206 --> 01:26:53.322
You look like you could use a drink.

1505
01:26:54.326 --> 01:26:55.441
Yes, thanks.

1506
01:26:56.086 --> 01:26:58.475
<i>Eddie Barzoon, Eddie Barzoon.</i>

1507
01:27:00.006 --> 01:27:04.045
<i>I nursed him through two divorces,
a cocaine rehab</i>

1508
01:27:04.406 --> 01:27:06.317
and a pregnant receptionist.

1509
01:27:07.606 --> 01:27:09.119
God's creature, right?

1510
01:27:09.526 --> 01:27:11.596
<i>God's special creature?</i>

1511
01:27:12.886 --> 01:27:14.524
<i>I've warned him, Kevin.</i>

1512
01:27:14.606 --> 01:27:16.881
<i>I've warned him
every step of the way.</i>

1513
01:27:17.006 --> 01:27:19.520
<i>Watching him bounce around
like a fucking game.</i>

1514
01:27:19.606 --> 01:27:21.039
<i>Like a wind-up toy.</i>

1515
01:27:21.126 --> 01:27:22.559
<i>Like 250 pounds</i>

1516
01:27:22.726 --> 01:27:25.479
<i>of self-serving greed on wheels.</i>

1517
01:27:25.646 --> 01:27:28.399
<i>The next thousand years
is right around the corner, Kevin.</i>

1518
01:27:28.486 --> 01:27:29.839
<i>Eddie Barzoon</i>

1519
01:27:29.926 --> 01:27:31.917
<i>take a good look because</i>

1520
01:27:32.006 --> 01:27:34.759
<i>he's the poster child
for the next millennium.</i>

1521
01:27:36.526 --> 01:27:37.561
<i>These people</i>

1522
01:27:37.646 --> 01:27:40.080
<i>it's no mystery where they come from.</i>

1523
01:27:43.526 --> 01:27:45.676
You sharpen the human appetite

1524
01:27:45.766 --> 01:27:49.361
to the point where it
can split atoms with its desire.

1525
01:27:49.606 --> 01:27:52.166
You build egos
the size of cathedrals.

1526
01:27:52.326 --> 01:27:55.921
Fiber-optically connect the world
to every eager impulse.

1527
01:27:56.326 --> 01:27:59.318
Grease even the dullest dreams
with these dollar-green

1528
01:27:59.406 --> 01:28:03.922
gold-plated fantasies until every human
becomes an aspiring emperor

1529
01:28:04.006 --> 01:28:07.123
<i>becomes his own god.
Where can you go from there?</i>

1530
01:28:07.286 --> 01:28:08.799
Hey! Wrong way!

1531
01:28:09.566 --> 01:28:10.635
Fuck you...

1532
01:28:11.046 --> 01:28:12.320
<i>As we're scrambling</i>

1533
01:28:12.406 --> 01:28:14.078
from one deal to the next

1534
01:28:14.166 --> 01:28:15.758
who's got his eye on the planet?

1535
01:28:15.846 --> 01:28:17.916
<i>As the air thickens, the water sours.</i>

1536
01:28:18.006 --> 01:28:21.282
<i>Even bees' honey takes on
the metallic taste of radioactivity</i>

1537
01:28:21.366 --> 01:28:24.483
<i>and it just keeps coming,
faster and faster.</i>

1538
01:28:25.686 --> 01:28:26.914
Help! Stop it!

1539
01:28:27.126 --> 01:28:29.515
<i>There's no chance to think,
to prepare.</i>

1540
01:28:29.686 --> 01:28:32.075
<i>It's buy futures, sell futures</i>

1541
01:28:32.246 --> 01:28:34.077
<i>when there is no future.</i>

1542
01:28:34.246 --> 01:28:36.237
<i>We got a runaway train, boy.</i>

1543
01:28:36.366 --> 01:28:40.075
<i>We got a billion Eddie Barzoons
all jogging into the future.</i>

1544
01:28:40.246 --> 01:28:43.841
Every one of them is getting ready
to fistfuck God's ex-planet

1545
01:28:44.006 --> 01:28:45.564
<i>lick their fingers clean</i>

1546
01:28:45.646 --> 01:28:47.762
<i>as they reach out
toward their pristine</i>

1547
01:28:47.846 --> 01:28:49.325
<i>cybernetic keyboards</i>

1548
01:28:49.406 --> 01:28:51.920
to tote up their
fucking billable hours.

1549
01:28:52.086 --> 01:28:54.202
<i>And then it hits home.</i>

1550
01:28:54.366 --> 01:28:56.482
<i>You got to pay your own way, Eddie.</i>

1551
01:28:56.806 --> 01:28:59.300
<i>It's a little late in the game
to buy out now.</i>

1552
01:28:59.386 --> 01:29:00.839
- Fuck!
- Give me your watch.

1553
01:29:00.926 --> 01:29:04.316
What? I like this watch! Do you think
you're just going try to take it?

1554
01:29:05.286 --> 01:29:06.924
<i>Your belly's too full</i>

1555
01:29:07.286 --> 01:29:08.878
<i>your dick is sore</i>

1556
01:29:08.966 --> 01:29:12.561
<i>your eyes are bloodshot and
you're screaming for someone to help.</i>

1557
01:29:12.646 --> 01:29:13.874
<i>But guess what?</i>

1558
01:29:14.566 --> 01:29:16.284
<i>There's no one there!</i>

1559
01:29:16.726 --> 01:29:18.637
<i>You're all alone, Eddie.</i>

1560
01:29:18.766 --> 01:29:21.485
<i>You're God's special little creature.</i>

1561
01:29:28.006 --> 01:29:29.155
Maybe it's true.

1562
01:29:29.246 --> 01:29:32.158
Maybe God threw the dice
once too often.

1563
01:29:33.166 --> 01:29:34.918
Maybe He let us all down.

1564
01:29:44.206 --> 01:29:46.959
You testified the defendant
called you at 4:30

1565
01:29:47.046 --> 01:29:50.482
to ask you to come to his office gym
for the purposes of sex.

1566
01:29:50.566 --> 01:29:51.555
Yes.

1567
01:29:51.766 --> 01:29:55.281
Mr. Cullen, though,
he's not just your lover, is he?

1568
01:29:55.646 --> 01:29:56.840
He's the boss.

1569
01:29:58.886 --> 01:29:59.841
Yes.

1570
01:30:00.006 --> 01:30:02.918
So two hours go by
before you act on his request?

1571
01:30:03.086 --> 01:30:04.963
Yes, I went up at 6:10.

1572
01:30:05.166 --> 01:30:07.885
It was 6:10 because I heard
the weather coming on the news.

1573
01:30:07.966 --> 01:30:09.035
Okay, stop.

1574
01:30:10.206 --> 01:30:12.322
This prosecutor is no fool.

1575
01:30:12.806 --> 01:30:16.515
He's going to change tempo,
attitude, tone of voice.

1576
01:30:16.686 --> 01:30:20.759
He's going to come out with questions
you never thought of just to screw you up.

1577
01:30:20.846 --> 01:30:22.325
So what do we do?

1578
01:30:24.326 --> 01:30:26.237
Yes and no answers. Stay calm.

1579
01:30:26.606 --> 01:30:27.880
Exactly.

1580
01:30:30.726 --> 01:30:35.402
Is it your testimony, mrs. Black,
that between the hours of 6:10 and 9:40

1581
01:30:35.566 --> 01:30:38.364
you were engaged in sexual congress
with the defendant?

1582
01:30:38.446 --> 01:30:39.196
Yes.

1583
01:30:39.286 --> 01:30:42.119
At any point during
this three-hour marathon, mrs. Black

1584
01:30:42.206 --> 01:30:43.844
did you lose sight of the defendant?

1585
01:30:43.926 --> 01:30:45.757
- No.
- Did he use the bathroom?

1586
01:30:46.406 --> 01:30:48.442
- Yes.
- Is he circumcised?

1587
01:30:53.926 --> 01:30:55.644
You understand the question?

1588
01:30:55.726 --> 01:30:56.681
Yeah.

1589
01:30:57.446 --> 01:30:59.482
So is he cut or not?

1590
01:31:00.046 --> 01:31:01.320
Yes.

1591
01:31:02.366 --> 01:31:03.481
Which is it?

1592
01:31:05.446 --> 01:31:08.119
You've polished his knob
three times a week for six months.

1593
01:31:08.206 --> 01:31:09.924
You don't know if he has foreskin?

1594
01:31:10.006 --> 01:31:11.644
I've had enough of your fucking game!

1595
01:31:11.726 --> 01:31:15.036
Why don't you take your questions
and shove them up your ass!

1596
01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:32.400
Kevin!

1597
01:31:32.526 --> 01:31:33.845
What's happening?

1598
01:31:33.966 --> 01:31:35.718
It's Eddie Barzoon.

1599
01:31:35.886 --> 01:31:36.921
What about him?

1600
01:31:37.006 --> 01:31:39.076
He's dead. He was killed.

1601
01:31:39.246 --> 01:31:40.804
- When?
- Last night.

1602
01:31:40.966 --> 01:31:43.275
- In the park.
- He was running, if you can believe it.

1603
01:31:43.366 --> 01:31:45.038
What is wrong with people?

1604
01:31:45.126 --> 01:31:47.481
At least they got
the scumbags who did it.

1605
01:31:47.566 --> 01:31:48.476
Who?

1606
01:31:48.646 --> 01:31:50.443
Two old homeless crazies.

1607
01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:54.260
Kevin.

1608
01:31:54.286 --> 01:31:55.958
Kevin, I'm sorry, you're due
in court in 30 minutes.

1609
01:31:56.046 --> 01:31:58.844
- You'd better get your things together.
- So, are we finished in here or what?

1610
01:31:58.926 --> 01:32:02.077
I'll bring Melissa down to the car.
But you better get going.

1611
01:32:05.006 --> 01:32:08.316
I want you to put Eddie aside.
Let me worry about it.

1612
01:32:09.926 --> 01:32:11.837
You've got to deal with Cullen.

1613
01:32:12.046 --> 01:32:15.834
You've got to marshal your strength.
Prioritize. Conserve your energy.

1614
01:32:16.206 --> 01:32:18.276
I can't put her on the stand.

1615
01:32:19.406 --> 01:32:22.000
- What choice do you have?
- I know she's lying!

1616
01:32:22.086 --> 01:32:25.683
She's lying... She's lying because
she didn't answer you fast enough?

1617
01:32:25.709 --> 01:32:26.787
She lied to you? No.

1618
01:32:27.566 --> 01:32:29.158
She said nothing.

1619
01:32:29.566 --> 01:32:31.602
Fact is, you'll never know anyway.

1620
01:32:31.846 --> 01:32:33.484
He killed those people.

1621
01:32:35.206 --> 01:32:36.798
You really believe that?

1622
01:32:38.086 --> 01:32:39.235
He set me up.

1623
01:32:39.406 --> 01:32:42.682
Cullen fucking set me up.
Melissa... the whole thing.

1624
01:32:43.046 --> 01:32:44.161
I know it.

1625
01:32:46.246 --> 01:32:47.838
Got to go with your gut.

1626
01:32:48.206 --> 01:32:49.605
That's your advice?

1627
01:32:51.046 --> 01:32:52.798
I'll back you either way.

1628
01:32:55.366 --> 01:32:57.596
Maybe it's your time to lose.

1629
01:32:59.046 --> 01:33:00.877
Think I haven't lost before?

1630
01:33:04.502 --> 01:33:05.602
Kevin?

1631
01:33:07.627 --> 01:33:08.727
Kevin?

1632
01:33:09.246 --> 01:33:11.680
We talked about this, remember?

1633
01:33:12.206 --> 01:33:13.321
Pressure.

1634
01:33:15.366 --> 01:33:16.765
Take a big whiff.

1635
01:33:18.726 --> 01:33:19.875
All rise!

1636
01:33:20.206 --> 01:33:22.276
The Honorable Armand Poe presiding.

1637
01:33:29.406 --> 01:33:30.759
Please be seated.

1638
01:33:35.166 --> 01:33:36.758
All right, mr. Lomax

1639
01:33:36.926 --> 01:33:38.803
you may present your case.

1640
01:33:57.566 --> 01:33:58.715
Mr. Lomax...

1641
01:34:19.726 --> 01:34:21.557
I call Melissa Black.

1642
01:34:38.606 --> 01:34:40.119
Raise your right hand.

1643
01:34:40.246 --> 01:34:42.202
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth

1644
01:34:42.286 --> 01:34:44.436
nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1645
01:34:44.526 --> 01:34:45.481
I do.

1646
01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:08.820
Kevin!

1647
01:35:10.846 --> 01:35:12.598
Feeney, it's him!

1648
01:35:15.526 --> 01:35:16.447
She didn't look well, sir.

1649
01:35:16.473 --> 01:35:18.384
Phil tried to talk to her
but she just kept going.

1650
01:35:18.446 --> 01:35:20.960
- Where is she?
- Church of the Heavenly Hope.

1651
01:35:46.606 --> 01:35:47.641
Honey.

1652
01:35:48.846 --> 01:35:50.120
It's me.

1653
01:35:51.086 --> 01:35:52.280
What happened?

1654
01:35:52.526 --> 01:35:53.720
Are you okay?

1655
01:35:54.526 --> 01:35:57.199
He let himself in.
You need to know that.

1656
01:35:57.806 --> 01:35:59.398
Who let himself in?

1657
01:36:00.206 --> 01:36:01.321
The bath

1658
01:36:01.486 --> 01:36:03.397
was running or something.

1659
01:36:04.046 --> 01:36:06.082
I didn't hear him. I swear to you.

1660
01:36:06.166 --> 01:36:07.804
And then we talked.

1661
01:36:08.766 --> 01:36:10.996
And we talked for hours.

1662
01:36:11.166 --> 01:36:13.316
And I haven't talked to anyone

1663
01:36:13.486 --> 01:36:15.875
really talked to anyone in so long.

1664
01:36:17.006 --> 01:36:18.519
Did somebody hurt you?

1665
01:36:19.326 --> 01:36:20.441
Yeah.

1666
01:36:21.286 --> 01:36:22.241
Who?

1667
01:36:24.606 --> 01:36:25.561
Milton.

1668
01:36:26.646 --> 01:36:28.716
What?

1669
01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:34.040
He...

1670
01:36:34.966 --> 01:36:36.445
He fucked me.

1671
01:36:38.846 --> 01:36:42.441
And I think I wanted him to,
but then I just...

1672
01:36:42.606 --> 01:36:45.120
I don't know,
I just couldn't stop him.

1673
01:36:46.126 --> 01:36:48.196
He just wouldn't stop.

1674
01:36:51.006 --> 01:36:52.041
When?

1675
01:36:53.166 --> 01:36:55.077
- Baby, when?
- Today.

1676
01:36:56.846 --> 01:36:58.325
The whole afternoon.

1677
01:36:58.406 --> 01:37:00.601
The whole afternoon.

1678
01:37:02.606 --> 01:37:03.880
I'm so ashamed.

1679
01:37:05.166 --> 01:37:06.155
Today?

1680
01:37:08.526 --> 01:37:09.641
Today?

1681
01:37:10.846 --> 01:37:12.404
Today he was in court.

1682
01:37:12.566 --> 01:37:15.399
He was in court
in my presence all afternoon!

1683
01:37:15.566 --> 01:37:16.760
- No!
- Yes!

1684
01:37:16.785 --> 01:37:19.385
Yes! Yes!

1685
01:37:19.710 --> 01:37:21.110
No!..

1686
01:37:21.566 --> 01:37:22.885
God, no, Kevin.

1687
01:37:23.406 --> 01:37:25.237
Kevin, I'm not crazy.

1688
01:37:25.606 --> 01:37:27.244
You have to believe me.

1689
01:37:32.606 --> 01:37:33.800
Oh, Jesus.

1690
01:37:33.966 --> 01:37:35.797
He did this to me!

1691
01:37:39.246 --> 01:37:40.759
He did this to me.

1692
01:37:40.846 --> 01:37:42.757
What did you do to yourself?

1693
01:37:43.086 --> 01:37:44.678
What are we going to do, baby?

1694
01:37:45.486 --> 01:37:47.044
What am I going to do?

1695
01:37:49.166 --> 01:37:52.602
Sign there. And your relationship.

1696
01:37:53.566 --> 01:37:57.241
She's calm now. This might be
a good time to say good night to her.

1697
01:38:05.326 --> 01:38:07.635
I know why this is happening.

1698
01:38:11.006 --> 01:38:12.644
They want you to sleep.

1699
01:38:14.366 --> 01:38:15.719
It's the money.

1700
01:38:16.646 --> 01:38:17.795
Blood money.

1701
01:38:18.686 --> 01:38:21.723
We just drank it down, both of us.

1702
01:38:22.526 --> 01:38:23.959
We knew it.

1703
01:38:25.486 --> 01:38:29.843
Winning those cases, taking the money.
We knew they were guilty.

1704
01:38:30.606 --> 01:38:32.915
But you just kept on winning

1705
01:38:33.286 --> 01:38:34.514
every time.

1706
01:38:40.486 --> 01:38:43.398
And I can't look at myself
in the mirror.

1707
01:38:43.966 --> 01:38:46.082
And then I see a monster.

1708
01:38:49.126 --> 01:38:50.923
Don't do this, Kevin.

1709
01:38:51.166 --> 01:38:53.236
Please take me home.

1710
01:38:53.406 --> 01:38:55.795
Please don't do this.

1711
01:38:56.366 --> 01:38:58.163
I'm not crazy.

1712
01:39:12.966 --> 01:39:15.355
Doesn't Diana look fabulous?

1713
01:39:23.526 --> 01:39:26.386
- Alessandra, you look ravishing.
- Thank you.

1714
01:39:28.326 --> 01:39:29.441
Mrs. Skylar.

1715
01:39:35.846 --> 01:39:37.404
We are here today

1716
01:39:37.926 --> 01:39:39.598
to remember Eddie Barzoon.

1717
01:39:39.686 --> 01:39:41.039
Isn't she lovely?

1718
01:39:41.166 --> 01:39:44.522
We have gathered to seek shelter
in our common grief.

1719
01:39:45.566 --> 01:39:47.875
To draw strength
toward our tested faith.

1720
01:39:47.966 --> 01:39:49.445
So what do they say?

1721
01:39:49.846 --> 01:39:51.199
How's Mary Ann?

1722
01:39:51.366 --> 01:39:52.640
They don't know.

1723
01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:54.220
She's...

1724
01:39:54.846 --> 01:39:56.279
She's falling apart.

1725
01:39:56.966 --> 01:39:58.240
Hallucinations.

1726
01:39:58.406 --> 01:39:59.475
Milton...

1727
01:40:01.406 --> 01:40:02.395
it's bad.

1728
01:40:05.406 --> 01:40:06.634
Do you have room for one more?

1729
01:40:06.726 --> 01:40:08.000
Beloved father.

1730
01:40:08.166 --> 01:40:09.485
Devoted husband.

1731
01:40:09.886 --> 01:40:11.114
Trusted friend.

1732
01:40:11.206 --> 01:40:13.561
Esteemed colleague.
Benevolent citizen.

1733
01:40:14.206 --> 01:40:15.639
All of these things.

1734
01:40:16.486 --> 01:40:18.522
And yet one thing more:

1735
01:40:19.326 --> 01:40:20.964
child of God.

1736
01:40:21.766 --> 01:40:25.103
And it is to that Father
that he now returns.

1737
01:40:25.766 --> 01:40:27.324
Eddie Barzoon

1738
01:40:27.486 --> 01:40:30.205
such a vibrant member
of our community

1739
01:40:30.886 --> 01:40:32.956
has moved beyond us now.

1740
01:40:33.766 --> 01:40:35.324
He has entered

1741
01:40:35.766 --> 01:40:37.165
a new communion.

1742
01:40:38.086 --> 01:40:40.395
And for that
it is a time of rejoicing.

1743
01:40:41.926 --> 01:40:44.963
God, who is our refuge
and our strength.

1744
01:40:46.086 --> 01:40:48.554
God, who is that very present help

1745
01:40:48.966 --> 01:40:50.479
in time of trouble.

1746
01:40:51.486 --> 01:40:53.761
"Therefore we will not fear"

1747
01:40:54.526 --> 01:40:56.403
"though the Earth should change"

1748
01:40:56.486 --> 01:40:59.284
"though the mountains shake
in the heart of the sea"

1749
01:40:59.366 --> 01:41:01.641
"though its waters roar and foam"

1750
01:41:02.046 --> 01:41:04.844
"though the mountains tremble
with its tumult."

1751
01:41:05.086 --> 01:41:06.804
We cannot fear too long

1752
01:41:07.366 --> 01:41:08.879
for Eddie Barzoon

1753
01:41:08.966 --> 01:41:10.365
has gone home.

1754
01:41:28.966 --> 01:41:30.001
Mr. Lomax?

1755
01:41:30.086 --> 01:41:32.316
No comment.
I'll have something for you later.

1756
01:41:32.406 --> 01:41:33.919
I'm a friend of Eddie Barzoon.

1757
01:41:34.006 --> 01:41:36.361
You don't know me,
but Eddie mentioned your name.

1758
01:41:36.446 --> 01:41:38.277
Mitch Weaver, Justice Department?

1759
01:41:38.366 --> 01:41:39.560
Staking out the funeral?

1760
01:41:39.646 --> 01:41:41.364
Looking for you, actually.

1761
01:41:42.046 --> 01:41:44.177
I'm in a bit of hurry.
I need to talk to my wife.

1762
01:41:44.266 --> 01:41:48.364
Just wanted to ask you, off the record...
I have a few questions about Eddie.

1763
01:42:04.766 --> 01:42:07.234
Milton-Chadwick-Waters
is a little more than a law firm.

1764
01:42:07.326 --> 01:42:09.157
But I assumed you knew that.

1765
01:42:09.566 --> 01:42:12.034
Vagada Holdings?
I'm sure you've heard of it.

1766
01:42:12.126 --> 01:42:15.482
London, Kinshasa, Karachi:
arms brokering, mostly.

1767
01:42:15.646 --> 01:42:19.355
Munzer-Dietch, in Berlin, Djakarta:
chemical weapons and toxic waste.

1768
01:42:19.526 --> 01:42:22.598
Ivanco Limited, Moscow:
money laundering for the eastern bloc.

1769
01:42:22.686 --> 01:42:26.520
Kevin, it goes on and on and on.
Milton is into everything.

1770
01:42:36.966 --> 01:42:40.481
Barzoon was coming in, Kevin.
He was going to testify.

1771
01:42:40.806 --> 01:42:42.717
DeSoto and Dibalista, Panama.

1772
01:42:42.886 --> 01:42:45.798
That firm sets up bank accounts
for judges in South America.

1773
01:42:45.886 --> 01:42:48.195
Huge drug cases, murder, everything.

1774
01:42:48.326 --> 01:42:51.045
What the fuck do you want?
He's a lawyer!

1775
01:42:52.126 --> 01:42:53.923
Now stay off my back!

1776
01:42:57.686 --> 01:42:59.995
This is a first-time last-time offer.

1777
01:43:00.566 --> 01:43:02.158
I'm learning about you.

1778
01:43:02.326 --> 01:43:05.124
I talked to some old friends
in Florida this morning.

1779
01:43:05.206 --> 01:43:06.321
The Gettys case?

1780
01:43:06.406 --> 01:43:08.158
Eighth grade teacher?

1781
01:43:10.166 --> 01:43:11.838
They found him yesterday!

1782
01:43:13.286 --> 01:43:16.676
He had the body of a 10-year-old girl
in the trunk of his car!

1783
01:43:35.686 --> 01:43:37.597
Is he all right? Get help!

1784
01:43:59.566 --> 01:44:01.921
Marie, do you want to go
to the party?

1785
01:44:02.326 --> 01:44:03.315
Come on.

1786
01:44:03.446 --> 01:44:04.720
Horace will be disappointed.

1787
01:44:04.806 --> 01:44:07.001
It's a birthday party.
We can sing.

1788
01:44:07.166 --> 01:44:09.122
"Indeed, His divine power"

1789
01:44:09.286 --> 01:44:13.120
"has granted us all things
pertaining to life and piety"

1790
01:44:13.286 --> 01:44:16.722
"through the knowledge of Him
who has called us..."

1791
01:44:17.047 --> 01:44:18.447
Kevin...

1792
01:44:19.926 --> 01:44:21.564
What are you doing here?

1793
01:44:22.486 --> 01:44:24.158
I came this morning.

1794
01:44:25.526 --> 01:44:28.165
I kept calling the house
and getting no answer.

1795
01:44:28.486 --> 01:44:30.078
I need to talk to you.

1796
01:44:30.246 --> 01:44:32.840
We got her on the first flight up
this morning.

1797
01:44:41.286 --> 01:44:42.958
Are you all right, Kevin?

1798
01:44:49.606 --> 01:44:50.755
I don't know.

1799
01:44:53.886 --> 01:44:56.559
Would you excuse us
for a moment, please?

1800
01:44:56.584 --> 01:44:57.684
Sure.

1801
01:44:59.206 --> 01:45:00.958
How you doing, sweetie?

1802
01:45:02.166 --> 01:45:04.475
I know something
that'll make you feel better.

1803
01:45:04.566 --> 01:45:05.840
There.

1804
01:45:09.126 --> 01:45:11.560
I shouldn't have left.
I knew it.

1805
01:45:13.006 --> 01:45:14.724
I'll never forgive myself.

1806
01:45:15.486 --> 01:45:19.115
- There's nothing you could've done.
- I could've told you the truth.

1807
01:45:20.646 --> 01:45:21.715
About what?

1808
01:45:22.446 --> 01:45:25.483
Baptist Endeavor
Youth Crusade, 1966.

1809
01:45:26.246 --> 01:45:28.202
I was here in New York.

1810
01:45:29.046 --> 01:45:31.924
That night in the elevator,
you never let me answer.

1811
01:45:33.206 --> 01:45:34.541
What are you talking about?

1812
01:45:34.626 --> 01:45:37.538
I stayed here a week
in the Tremont Hotel.

1813
01:45:38.566 --> 01:45:41.717
They had a restaurant downstairs
where we ate almost every meal.

1814
01:45:41.806 --> 01:45:42.875
Wait. Stop.

1815
01:45:42.966 --> 01:45:45.526
Your father was a waiter
in that restaurant.

1816
01:45:47.486 --> 01:45:48.521
My father?

1817
01:45:52.366 --> 01:45:54.243
This is great, ma.

1818
01:45:56.846 --> 01:45:57.881
Honey, please listen.

1819
01:45:57.966 --> 01:45:58.842
Now?

1820
01:45:59.046 --> 01:46:00.525
You do this now?

1821
01:46:00.846 --> 01:46:02.677
Because your timing, it's superb.

1822
01:46:02.766 --> 01:46:05.599
You wait 30 years,
you fly up here, you pick today?

1823
01:46:06.926 --> 01:46:08.860
Obviously I'm not
under enough pressure.

1824
01:46:08.886 --> 01:46:11.103
I don't have enough on my mind!
I need this...

1825
01:46:13.326 --> 01:46:14.805
Listen to me!

1826
01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:16.930
Kevin!

1827
01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:20.020
Kevin!

1828
01:46:20.446 --> 01:46:24.359
"Behold, I send you out as sheep
amidst the wolves!"

1829
01:46:30.126 --> 01:46:32.515
Don't you look beautiful now.

1830
01:46:36.486 --> 01:46:37.919
Take a look and see.

1831
01:46:38.686 --> 01:46:40.802
It's all right, dear. Look.

1832
01:46:40.926 --> 01:46:41.802
No.

1833
01:46:41.966 --> 01:46:43.718
Go on, take a look.

1834
01:46:44.046 --> 01:46:46.276
See how beautiful you are?

1835
01:46:52.966 --> 01:46:54.319
See?

1836
01:47:01.786 --> 01:47:02.980
What happened?

1837
01:47:03.066 --> 01:47:04.319
She attacked me!

1838
01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:08.500
Mary Ann!

1839
01:47:08.526 --> 01:47:10.154
Mary Ann, open the door.

1840
01:47:10.286 --> 01:47:11.878
Open the door, Mar.

1841
01:47:15.246 --> 01:47:16.804
Open the door, Mar!

1842
01:47:17.329 --> 01:47:19.329
Mar! Come on, Mar!

1843
01:47:20.006 --> 01:47:21.375
Mar, it's okay.

1844
01:47:21.486 --> 01:47:23.514
- Open the door!
- No!

1845
01:47:24.526 --> 01:47:26.025
Come on!

1846
01:47:26.286 --> 01:47:27.814
Mar open the door!

1847
01:47:30.686 --> 01:47:32.085
Open the door, Mar!

1848
01:47:32.646 --> 01:47:36.036
Oh, my God! Get somebody!
Get somebody! Go! Go! Mar, look at me!

1849
01:47:36.766 --> 01:47:38.279
Somebody! Help!

1850
01:47:38.304 --> 01:47:40.304
Stop!

1851
01:47:40.806 --> 01:47:41.841
Pam, get help!

1852
01:47:42.446 --> 01:47:43.799
Go!

1853
01:47:49.966 --> 01:47:51.035
Sweetheart!

1854
01:47:55.406 --> 01:47:56.521
Look at me!

1855
01:47:56.686 --> 01:47:57.880
I love you.

1856
01:48:06.926 --> 01:48:08.359
What have you done?

1857
01:48:08.446 --> 01:48:10.084
What have you done?

1858
01:48:11.726 --> 01:48:13.956
We need a doctor in here!

1859
01:48:14.446 --> 01:48:16.402
We need a doctor!

1860
01:48:18.246 --> 01:48:20.965
Please stay with me, Mar!

1861
01:48:22.286 --> 01:48:23.685
Mar! Stay with me, Mar!

1862
01:48:23.846 --> 01:48:25.802
Get dr. Job in here now!

1863
01:48:26.126 --> 01:48:28.959
Sir, get away so that
I can help her. Now!

1864
01:48:29.446 --> 01:48:31.084
Sir, off! Go!

1865
01:48:31.686 --> 01:48:33.085
Come on. Come on.

1866
01:48:34.126 --> 01:48:36.845
- Help her.
- Out of the way.

1867
01:48:37.406 --> 01:48:40.125
Get dr. Job, please!
I'm losing her!

1868
01:48:55.246 --> 01:48:56.679
Finish the story.

1869
01:48:57.166 --> 01:48:59.634
1966. You were in New York.

1870
01:48:59.766 --> 01:49:01.882
There's a waiter in a restaurant.

1871
01:49:02.266 --> 01:49:03.585
Finish the story.

1872
01:49:07.066 --> 01:49:08.658
He talked to me.

1873
01:49:09.166 --> 01:49:11.839
Nobody'd ever really
talked to me before.

1874
01:49:12.046 --> 01:49:16.817
Sixteen years old, a thousand miles away
from home, someone takes an interest...

1875
01:49:16.846 --> 01:49:20.343
Knew the Bible, every word.
Just knew it by heart.

1876
01:49:22.446 --> 01:49:25.704
Every meal, there he was
at my ear and I was...

1877
01:49:26.526 --> 01:49:30.262
That last night he came
to say good-bye and...

1878
01:49:32.126 --> 01:49:33.639
I started crying.

1879
01:49:33.806 --> 01:49:35.717
And he told me:

1880
01:49:37.166 --> 01:49:40.681
"Behold, I send you out as sheep
amidst the wolves."

1881
01:49:41.166 --> 01:49:42.997
I want to hear you say it.

1882
01:49:45.646 --> 01:49:47.477
His face that night,
I knew it was him.

1883
01:49:47.566 --> 01:49:48.362
Say it.

1884
01:49:48.446 --> 01:49:53.117
You were so proud you'd just come
to New York and done this all on your own.

1885
01:49:53.142 --> 01:49:54.005
Say it!

1886
01:49:54.006 --> 01:49:57.256
I didn't have the heart to tell you.
And you wondered yourself.

1887
01:49:57.281 --> 01:49:57.881
Say it!

1888
01:49:57.882 --> 01:50:01.339
The money that apartment, the attention,
everything out of nowhere!

1889
01:50:01.426 --> 01:50:02.381
Say it!

1890
01:50:02.846 --> 01:50:04.677
Milton, he's your...

1891
01:50:05.246 --> 01:50:06.315
father.

1892
01:50:07.086 --> 01:50:08.599
He's your father.

1893
01:50:10.046 --> 01:50:11.718
Somehow he found us.

1894
01:50:11.886 --> 01:50:13.824
- He tracked you down.
- No.

1895
01:50:13.886 --> 01:50:14.882
He did.

1896
01:50:14.966 --> 01:50:16.877
He's always been there.

1897
01:50:17.966 --> 01:50:19.638
I know that now.

1898
01:50:20.926 --> 01:50:22.041
Watching.

1899
01:50:22.926 --> 01:50:23.881
Waiting.

1900
01:50:25.606 --> 01:50:27.483
Playing us like a game.

1901
01:50:27.846 --> 01:50:28.915
What do you mean?

1902
01:50:29.006 --> 01:50:30.325
I gotta go.

1903
01:50:31.566 --> 01:50:33.875
No, leave it alone.
Stay here with me.

1904
01:50:33.966 --> 01:50:36.241
Just forget about him.
We can leave here.

1905
01:50:36.446 --> 01:50:39.006
We can go home.
We don't ever have to see him again.

1906
01:50:39.086 --> 01:50:40.880
I can't do it.

1907
01:50:41.486 --> 01:50:43.404
You go home. You go home.

1908
01:50:43.786 --> 01:50:45.101
- Kevin!
- I have to go.

1909
01:50:45.186 --> 01:50:47.222
- I have to go.
- Wait!

1910
01:50:48.206 --> 01:50:49.275
I love you.

1911
01:50:58.806 --> 01:51:00.364
There you are.

1912
01:51:01.206 --> 01:51:03.561
- Pam!
- Look at you. You're terrified.

1913
01:51:03.806 --> 01:51:05.159
Not to worry.

1914
01:51:05.326 --> 01:51:06.998
He'll take away that fear.

1915
01:51:07.086 --> 01:51:09.600
You don't ever have
to be frightened again.

1916
01:51:09.846 --> 01:51:10.915
Go on.

1917
01:51:11.086 --> 01:51:12.599
He's waiting for you.

1918
01:51:13.326 --> 01:51:14.281
Go.

1919
01:52:26.146 --> 01:52:28.018
You were right about one thing,
Kevin.

1920
01:52:28.106 --> 01:52:31.484
I have been watching.
Couldn't help myself.

1921
01:52:31.546 --> 01:52:32.735
Watching.

1922
01:52:32.806 --> 01:52:34.095
Waiting.

1923
01:52:34.766 --> 01:52:36.065
Holding my breath.

1924
01:52:36.086 --> 01:52:38.395
But I'm no puppeteer, Kevin.

1925
01:52:39.546 --> 01:52:41.616
I don't make things happen.

1926
01:52:41.946 --> 01:52:43.140
Doesn't work like that.

1927
01:52:43.226 --> 01:52:44.944
What'd you do to Mary Ann?

1928
01:52:45.026 --> 01:52:46.584
Free will.

1929
01:52:46.746 --> 01:52:48.737
It's like butterfly wings.

1930
01:52:48.866 --> 01:52:51.380
Once touched,
they never get off the ground.

1931
01:52:52.766 --> 01:52:55.075
I only set the stage.

1932
01:52:55.566 --> 01:52:56.840
You pull your own strings.

1933
01:52:56.926 --> 01:52:59.121
What did you do to Mary Ann?

1934
01:52:59.586 --> 01:53:00.985
A gun?

1935
01:53:01.306 --> 01:53:02.261
In here?

1936
01:53:02.326 --> 01:53:04.840
Goddamn it,
what did you do to my wife?

1937
01:53:06.206 --> 01:53:07.275
Well

1938
01:53:09.046 --> 01:53:11.196
on a scale of one to ten...

1939
01:53:11.446 --> 01:53:15.280
Ten being the most depraved act
of sexual theater known to man.

1940
01:53:15.446 --> 01:53:19.121
One being your average
Friday night run-through at the Lomaxes'.

1941
01:53:19.546 --> 01:53:21.537
I'd say, not to be immodest

1942
01:53:21.666 --> 01:53:25.341
Mary Ann and I got it on
at about seven.

1943
01:53:25.506 --> 01:53:26.734
Fuck you!

1944
01:53:28.046 --> 01:53:29.559
Got me!

1945
01:53:29.646 --> 01:53:31.477
Got me! Yes!

1946
01:53:33.700 --> 01:53:34.800
Yes!

1947
01:53:35.726 --> 01:53:38.286
Step it up, son!
Come on! That's good!

1948
01:53:38.486 --> 01:53:40.681
You got to hold on to that fury!

1949
01:53:41.146 --> 01:53:42.545
That's the last thing to go!

1950
01:53:42.626 --> 01:53:47.017
That's the final hiding place.
It's the final fig leaf.

1951
01:53:47.866 --> 01:53:49.743
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

1952
01:53:50.586 --> 01:53:51.701
Who are you?

1953
01:53:53.106 --> 01:53:54.858
Never lost a case.

1954
01:53:56.426 --> 01:53:57.461
Why?

1955
01:53:57.986 --> 01:53:59.305
Why do you think?

1956
01:54:00.066 --> 01:54:02.296
Because you're so fucking good.

1957
01:54:02.746 --> 01:54:03.781
Yes.

1958
01:54:04.766 --> 01:54:05.721
But why?

1959
01:54:07.766 --> 01:54:09.438
Because you're my father?

1960
01:54:09.806 --> 01:54:12.081
I'm a little more than that, Kevin.

1961
01:54:12.806 --> 01:54:15.639
Awfully hot in that courtroom,
wasn't it?

1962
01:54:15.806 --> 01:54:18.081
"What's the game plan, Kevin?"

1963
01:54:19.206 --> 01:54:20.685
"It was a nice run, Kev."

1964
01:54:20.766 --> 01:54:22.643
"Had to close out some day."

1965
01:54:22.766 --> 01:54:24.757
"Nobody wins them all."

1966
01:54:26.486 --> 01:54:27.635
What are you?

1967
01:54:30.926 --> 01:54:33.076
I have so many names.

1968
01:54:34.846 --> 01:54:35.801
Satan.

1969
01:54:38.486 --> 01:54:39.714
Call me dad.

1970
01:54:42.846 --> 01:54:44.404
Mary Ann, she knew it.

1971
01:54:45.566 --> 01:54:48.478
She knew it. She knew it,
so you destroyed her.

1972
01:54:48.606 --> 01:54:50.995
You're blaming me for Mary Ann?

1973
01:54:51.486 --> 01:54:53.044
I hope you're kidding.

1974
01:54:53.366 --> 01:54:56.039
Mary Ann, you could have
saved her anytime you liked.

1975
01:54:56.126 --> 01:54:57.718
All she wanted was love.

1976
01:54:57.886 --> 01:54:59.797
Hey, you were too busy.

1977
01:54:59.966 --> 01:55:01.115
That's a lie.

1978
01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:02.525
Mary Ann and New York?

1979
01:55:02.526 --> 01:55:06.439
Face it, you started looking to
better-deal her the minute you got here.

1980
01:55:06.726 --> 01:55:08.798
That's not true.
You don't know what we had!

1981
01:55:08.823 --> 01:55:11.240
- You don't know anything about her!
- I'm on your side!

1982
01:55:11.326 --> 01:55:12.645
You're a liar!

1983
01:55:12.670 --> 01:55:14.525
Hey! Kevin!

1984
01:55:14.526 --> 01:55:16.835
There's nothing out there for you!

1985
01:55:16.926 --> 01:55:19.645
Don't be such a fucking chump!

1986
01:55:20.126 --> 01:55:22.515
Stop deluding yourself!

1987
01:55:23.606 --> 01:55:25.801
I told you to take care of your wife!

1988
01:55:26.006 --> 01:55:27.200
What did I say?

1989
01:55:27.366 --> 01:55:30.676
"The world would understand."
Didn't I say that?

1990
01:55:30.846 --> 01:55:32.120
What did you do?

1991
01:55:33.086 --> 01:55:34.997
"You know what scares me, John?

1992
01:55:35.166 --> 01:55:39.159
"I leave the case, she gets better
and then I hate her for it."

1993
01:55:39.846 --> 01:55:41.245
Remember?

1994
01:55:42.126 --> 01:55:43.639
I know what you did.

1995
01:55:43.706 --> 01:55:45.000
You set me up!

1996
01:55:45.086 --> 01:55:47.316
Who told you to pull out
all the stops on mr. Gettys?

1997
01:55:47.406 --> 01:55:50.443
- Who made that choice?
- It's entrapment. You set me up!

1998
01:55:50.526 --> 01:55:53.245
And Moyez!
The direction you took!

1999
01:55:53.406 --> 01:55:57.399
Popes, swamis, snake handlers,
all feeding at the same trough.

2000
01:55:57.566 --> 01:55:59.875
- Whose ideas were those?
- You played me!

2001
01:56:00.086 --> 01:56:01.565
It was a test! Your test!

2002
01:56:01.646 --> 01:56:04.604
And Cullen!
Knowing he was guilty!

2003
01:56:05.406 --> 01:56:07.078
Seeing those pictures!

2004
01:56:07.166 --> 01:56:10.681
What did you do?
You put that lying bitch on the stand!

2005
01:56:10.846 --> 01:56:13.918
You brought me in.
You put me there! You made her lie!

2006
01:56:14.006 --> 01:56:15.837
I don't do that, Kevin!

2007
01:56:15.926 --> 01:56:18.520
That day on the subway,
what did I say to you?

2008
01:56:18.806 --> 01:56:20.717
What were my words to you?

2009
01:56:22.046 --> 01:56:25.516
Maybe it was your time to lose.
You didn't think so.

2010
01:56:25.646 --> 01:56:27.637
Lose? I don't lose!

2011
01:56:27.966 --> 01:56:29.115
I win!

2012
01:56:29.366 --> 01:56:30.719
I win!

2013
01:56:30.886 --> 01:56:33.844
I'm a lawyer! That's my job!
That's what I do!

2014
01:56:35.966 --> 01:56:37.194
I rest my case.

2015
01:56:42.326 --> 01:56:43.805
Vanity

2016
01:56:44.286 --> 01:56:46.800
is definitely my favorite sin.

2017
01:56:48.206 --> 01:56:50.595
Kevin, it's so basic.

2018
01:56:50.846 --> 01:56:52.120
Self-love.

2019
01:56:52.286 --> 01:56:54.800
The all-natural opiate.

2020
01:56:55.806 --> 01:56:59.037
It's not that you didn't care
for Mary Ann, Kevin

2021
01:57:00.086 --> 01:57:03.795
it's just that you were a little bit
more involved with someone else.

2022
01:57:05.486 --> 01:57:07.044
Yourself.

2023
01:57:09.686 --> 01:57:10.880
You're right.

2024
01:57:11.246 --> 01:57:12.599
I did it all.

2025
01:57:13.246 --> 01:57:14.281
I let her go.

2026
01:57:14.366 --> 01:57:18.564
Don't be too hard on yourself, Kevin.
You wanted something more.

2027
01:57:18.726 --> 01:57:19.954
Believe me.

2028
01:57:21.086 --> 01:57:23.316
I left her behind
and just kept going.

2029
01:57:23.486 --> 01:57:25.522
You can't keep punishing
yourself, Kevin

2030
01:57:26.366 --> 01:57:29.085
It's awesome how far you've come.

2031
01:57:29.646 --> 01:57:31.398
I didn't make it easy.

2032
01:57:31.766 --> 01:57:32.915
Couldn't.

2033
01:57:33.726 --> 01:57:35.159
Not for you

2034
01:57:38.006 --> 01:57:39.405
or your sister.

2035
01:57:43.766 --> 01:57:45.677
Half-sister, to be exact.

2036
01:57:46.366 --> 01:57:47.799
Surprise.

2037
01:57:48.606 --> 01:57:50.798
Some scene, right Kevin?

2038
01:57:53.846 --> 01:57:55.484
Don't let him scare you.

2039
01:57:55.485 --> 01:57:56.420
Kevin...

2040
01:57:56.446 --> 01:57:58.516
I've had so many children.

2041
01:57:59.006 --> 01:58:01.645
I've had so many disappointments.

2042
01:58:02.206 --> 01:58:04.162
Mistake after mistake.

2043
01:58:04.326 --> 01:58:05.839
And then there's you.

2044
01:58:05.966 --> 01:58:07.160
The two of you.

2045
01:58:10.206 --> 01:58:11.798
What do you want from me?

2046
01:58:11.886 --> 01:58:13.604
I want you to be yourself.

2047
01:58:13.886 --> 01:58:15.524
You know, I'll tell you, boy

2048
01:58:15.606 --> 01:58:16.755
guilt

2049
01:58:16.926 --> 01:58:19.156
it's like a bag of fucking bricks.

2050
01:58:19.246 --> 01:58:20.838
All you got to do

2051
01:58:21.166 --> 01:58:22.679
is set it down.

2052
01:58:25.806 --> 01:58:27.876
I know what you're going through.

2053
01:58:27.966 --> 01:58:29.240
I've been there.

2054
01:58:29.486 --> 01:58:31.238
Just come here. Come here.

2055
01:58:31.406 --> 01:58:32.839
Let it go.

2056
01:58:34.286 --> 01:58:35.924
I can't do that.

2057
01:58:39.486 --> 01:58:42.319
Who are you carrying
all those bricks for, anyway?

2058
01:58:43.006 --> 01:58:44.325
God?

2059
01:58:44.486 --> 01:58:45.805
Is that it?

2060
01:58:45.966 --> 01:58:47.081
God?

2061
01:58:47.226 --> 01:58:48.520
Well, I'll tell you.

2062
01:58:48.606 --> 01:58:51.916
Let me give you a little
inside information about God.

2063
01:58:52.446 --> 01:58:54.198
God likes to watch.

2064
01:58:54.366 --> 01:58:55.719
He's a prankster.

2065
01:58:55.806 --> 01:58:57.080
Think about it.

2066
01:58:57.406 --> 01:58:58.998
He gives man

2067
01:58:59.166 --> 01:59:00.519
instincts.

2068
01:59:01.326 --> 01:59:04.762
He gives you this extraordinary gift,
and then what does He do?

2069
01:59:04.926 --> 01:59:07.679
I swear, for his own amusement

2070
01:59:07.806 --> 01:59:10.639
his own private, cosmic

2071
01:59:10.766 --> 01:59:12.040
gag reel

2072
01:59:12.806 --> 01:59:15.161
He sets the rules in opposition.

2073
01:59:15.326 --> 01:59:16.759
It's the goof of all time.

2074
01:59:16.846 --> 01:59:19.076
Look, but don't touch.

2075
01:59:20.686 --> 01:59:22.916
Touch, but don't taste.

2076
01:59:24.686 --> 01:59:26.836
Taste, but don't swallow.

2077
01:59:28.046 --> 01:59:31.800
And while you're jumping from one foot
to the next, what is He doing?

2078
01:59:31.966 --> 01:59:35.322
He's laughing his sick,
fucking ass off!

2079
01:59:35.606 --> 01:59:37.039
He's a tightass!

2080
01:59:37.206 --> 01:59:39.401
He's a sadist!

2081
01:59:39.886 --> 01:59:42.446
He's an absentee landlord!

2082
01:59:42.606 --> 01:59:44.801
Worship that? Never!

2083
01:59:45.566 --> 01:59:48.603
"Better to reign in hell
than serve in Heaven" is that it?

2084
01:59:48.686 --> 01:59:49.801
Why not?

2085
01:59:50.046 --> 01:59:54.517
I'm here on the ground with my nose in it
since the whole thing began!

2086
01:59:55.406 --> 01:59:59.718
I've nurtured every sensation
man has been inspired to have!

2087
01:59:59.966 --> 02:00:03.481
I cared about what he wanted
and I never judged him!

2088
02:00:03.606 --> 02:00:07.997
Why? Because I never rejected him,
in spite of all his imperfections!

2089
02:00:08.206 --> 02:00:10.197
I'm a fan of man!

2090
02:00:12.046 --> 02:00:13.399
I'm a humanist.

2091
02:00:13.726 --> 02:00:15.523
Maybe the last humanist.

2092
02:00:16.486 --> 02:00:18.442
Who, in their right mind

2093
02:00:18.526 --> 02:00:20.756
Kevin, could possibly deny

2094
02:00:20.926 --> 02:00:23.645
the 20th century was entirely mine?

2095
02:00:23.806 --> 02:00:26.161
All of it, Kevin!

2096
02:00:26.686 --> 02:00:28.005
All of it.

2097
02:00:28.606 --> 02:00:29.800
Mine.

2098
02:00:30.846 --> 02:00:32.438
I'm peaking, Kevin.

2099
02:00:33.286 --> 02:00:34.605
It's my time now.

2100
02:00:36.526 --> 02:00:37.754
It's our time.

2101
02:00:38.526 --> 02:00:40.005
Anybody want a drink?

2102
02:00:41.806 --> 02:00:43.319
I'm having a drink.

2103
02:00:46.526 --> 02:00:48.642
This is some pitch, all this.

2104
02:00:49.766 --> 02:00:51.438
You must need me pretty bad.

2105
02:00:51.526 --> 02:00:52.925
What do you want?

2106
02:00:54.246 --> 02:00:55.520
Eddie was right.

2107
02:00:56.766 --> 02:00:58.836
I want you to take over the firm.

2108
02:00:59.526 --> 02:01:00.561
You

2109
02:01:01.686 --> 02:01:03.085
and your sister.

2110
02:01:07.166 --> 02:01:08.963
- Is that it?
- No.

2111
02:01:11.206 --> 02:01:12.924
She's ovulating

2112
02:01:13.286 --> 02:01:14.480
right now.

2113
02:01:15.646 --> 02:01:17.045
Your vanity

2114
02:01:17.246 --> 02:01:19.635
is justified, Kevin.

2115
02:01:20.926 --> 02:01:22.075
Your seed

2116
02:01:22.246 --> 02:01:24.123
is the key to a new future.

2117
02:01:24.766 --> 02:01:28.475
Your son is going to sit
at the head of all tables, my boy.

2118
02:01:29.086 --> 02:01:31.600
He's gonna set this whole thing free.

2119
02:01:32.926 --> 02:01:34.359
You want a child.

2120
02:01:34.726 --> 02:01:36.478
I want a family.

2121
02:01:37.566 --> 02:01:38.885
The Antichrist.

2122
02:01:43.366 --> 02:01:44.799
Whatever.

2123
02:01:49.126 --> 02:01:51.196
But I have to volunteer.

2124
02:01:52.646 --> 02:01:54.364
Free will

2125
02:01:54.886 --> 02:01:56.239
it is a bitch.

2126
02:01:56.640 --> 02:01:58.080
Kevin...

2127
02:01:58.206 --> 02:01:59.958
I need a family.

2128
02:02:00.126 --> 02:02:02.082
I need help. I'm busy.

2129
02:02:02.246 --> 02:02:03.964
Millennium's coming, son.

2130
02:02:04.126 --> 02:02:06.720
Title fight. Round 20.

2131
02:02:08.646 --> 02:02:10.557
I'm ready to work.

2132
02:02:12.166 --> 02:02:13.485
What do you say, Kev?

2133
02:02:14.406 --> 02:02:15.885
What're you offering?

2134
02:02:18.246 --> 02:02:19.679
Are we negotiating?

2135
02:02:19.806 --> 02:02:20.875
Always.

2136
02:02:23.046 --> 02:02:24.445
Yes!

2137
02:02:25.886 --> 02:02:27.399
What are you offering?

2138
02:02:28.166 --> 02:02:29.394
Everything.

2139
02:02:29.566 --> 02:02:30.635
Anything.

2140
02:02:30.806 --> 02:02:33.161
What do you want?
How about bliss, for starters?

2141
02:02:33.246 --> 02:02:34.315
Instant bliss.

2142
02:02:34.406 --> 02:02:35.839
Bliss on tap.

2143
02:02:37.046 --> 02:02:39.355
Bliss any way you want it.

2144
02:02:41.886 --> 02:02:43.922
That first line of cocaine.

2145
02:02:44.446 --> 02:02:47.040
That walk into a strange
girl's bedroom.

2146
02:02:48.766 --> 02:02:49.835
Familiar?

2147
02:02:51.206 --> 02:02:53.800
You're gonna have to do
a little better than that.

2148
02:02:53.886 --> 02:02:55.035
I know.

2149
02:02:55.806 --> 02:02:57.524
I'm just getting warmed up.

2150
02:02:57.886 --> 02:03:01.401
You want more, don't you?
You deserve more.

2151
02:03:01.566 --> 02:03:03.796
How about the thing
you love the most?

2152
02:03:04.286 --> 02:03:05.924
A smile from a jury.

2153
02:03:06.246 --> 02:03:10.205
That cold courtroom
just giving itself over

2154
02:03:11.326 --> 02:03:13.396
bending to your strength.

2155
02:03:14.846 --> 02:03:16.359
I get that on my own.

2156
02:03:16.486 --> 02:03:18.317
Not like this.

2157
02:03:18.486 --> 02:03:20.795
I take the bricks out
of the briefcase.

2158
02:03:20.966 --> 02:03:22.399
I give you pleasure.

2159
02:03:23.486 --> 02:03:24.601
No strings!

2160
02:03:24.766 --> 02:03:26.085
Freedom, baby

2161
02:03:26.406 --> 02:03:28.795
is never having to say you're sorry.

2162
02:03:30.366 --> 02:03:32.163
This is revolution, Kevin.

2163
02:03:32.688 --> 02:03:34.388

Because the law, my boy,
puts us into everything.

2178
02:04:10.726 --> 02:04:14.958
It's the ultimate backstage pass.
It's the new priesthood, baby.

2179
02:04:15.526 --> 02:04:18.324
Did you know there are
more students in law school

2180
02:04:18.406 --> 02:04:20.397
than lawyers walking the Earth?

2181
02:04:20.486 --> 02:04:21.919
We're coming out

2182
02:04:22.646 --> 02:04:24.238
guns blazing!

2183
02:04:25.526 --> 02:04:27.198
The two of you

2184
02:04:27.366 --> 02:04:31.200
all of us, acquittal after
acquittal after acquittal

2185
02:04:31.286 --> 02:04:34.881
until the stench of it reaches
so high and far into Heaven

2186
02:04:35.046 --> 02:04:38.322
it chokes the whole
fucking lot of them!

2187
02:04:40.326 --> 02:04:42.317
In the Bible, you lose.

2188
02:04:43.606 --> 02:04:45.517
We're destined to lose, dad.

2189
02:04:45.646 --> 02:04:47.637
Consider the source, son!

2190
02:04:49.286 --> 02:04:50.321
Besides

2191
02:04:50.486 --> 02:04:52.317
we'll write our own book.

2192
02:04:52.406 --> 02:04:54.158
Chapter one.

2193
02:04:55.046 --> 02:04:57.037
Right here. This altar.

2194
02:04:57.846 --> 02:04:59.199
This moment.

2195
02:04:59.766 --> 02:05:01.279
Will you stop talking?

2196
02:05:01.366 --> 02:05:02.719
You talk too much.

2197
02:05:03.286 --> 02:05:04.560
Both of you.

2198
02:05:07.686 --> 02:05:08.801
Look at me.

2199
02:05:10.246 --> 02:05:11.599
Just look at me.

2200
02:05:21.126 --> 02:05:23.720
She is really stunning.

2201
02:05:29.686 --> 02:05:31.039
Who am I?

2202
02:05:50.246 --> 02:05:52.635
I've wanted you
from the moment we met.

2203
02:05:54.794 --> 02:05:57.794
Diaboli virtus in lumbis est.

2204
02:05:58.420 --> 02:06:01.420
Diaboli virtus in lumbis est.

2205
02:06:01.846 --> 02:06:04.406
The virtue of the devil
is in his loins.

2206
02:06:08.086 --> 02:06:09.519
What about love?

2207
02:06:13.366 --> 02:06:14.435
Overrated.

2208
02:06:14.886 --> 02:06:15.796
Biochemically

2209
02:06:15.886 --> 02:06:20.164
no different than eating
large quantities of chocolate.

2210
02:06:21.926 --> 02:06:25.362
In two minutes you won't be thinking
about Mary Ann ever again.

2211
02:06:25.606 --> 02:06:26.800
Come here.

2212
02:06:28.326 --> 02:06:30.362
She's right, my son.

2213
02:06:36.886 --> 02:06:40.481
It's time to step up
and take what's yours.

2214
02:06:45.206 --> 02:06:46.400
You're right.

2215
02:06:48.726 --> 02:06:50.079
It's time.

2216
02:06:50.646 --> 02:06:52.318
Free will, right?

2217
02:06:57.326 --> 02:06:58.441
No!

2218
02:07:11.966 --> 02:07:13.399
Damn you!

2219
02:07:16.566 --> 02:07:18.477
Enough!

2220
02:07:20.326 --> 02:07:22.794
Haven't I given enough?

2221
02:08:24.166 --> 02:08:25.799
It was a nice run, Kev.

2222
02:08:25.846 --> 02:08:27.757
Had to close out someday.

2223
02:08:28.566 --> 02:08:30.079
Nobody wins them all.

2224
02:09:17.606 --> 02:09:19.597
What are you doing, baby?

2225
02:09:21.526 --> 02:09:22.845
Are you okay?

2226
02:09:25.766 --> 02:09:27.279
I am now.

2227
02:09:30.806 --> 02:09:32.319
All rise.

2228
02:09:32.726 --> 02:09:35.638
The Honorable Judge
Garson Deeds presiding.

2229
02:09:38.486 --> 02:09:39.919
Please be seated.

2230
02:09:43.846 --> 02:09:46.406
You're still under oath, young lady.

2231
02:09:49.406 --> 02:09:50.600
Your witness, mr. Lomax.

2232
02:10:02.006 --> 02:10:03.439
Mr. Lomax?

2233
02:10:07.926 --> 02:10:09.075
Your Honor

2234
02:10:10.806 --> 02:10:12.762
I'm terribly sorry.

2235
02:10:14.006 --> 02:10:16.395
But I can no longer
represent my client.

2236
02:10:18.846 --> 02:10:20.996
I need to be replaced as counsel.

2237
02:10:21.086 --> 02:10:23.156
Order. Order! Order!

2238
02:10:24.126 --> 02:10:25.844
I adjourn this court.

2239
02:10:26.006 --> 02:10:27.479
Mr. Lomax, this is outrageous.

2240
02:10:27.505 --> 02:10:29.667
Are you aware
of the consequences of this action?

2241
02:10:29.726 --> 02:10:30.841
I am, sir.

2242
02:10:31.006 --> 02:10:34.476
I want to see both attorneys
in my chambers immediately.

2243
02:10:34.646 --> 02:10:38.275
I'm going to adjourn this trial
until 9 a.m. tomorrow morning.

2244
02:10:39.446 --> 02:10:41.084
I trusted you to defend me.

2245
02:10:41.166 --> 02:10:43.316
You swore you would!
You'll burn for this!

2246
02:10:43.406 --> 02:10:46.000
You just made
the biggest mistake of your life!

2247
02:10:47.006 --> 02:10:48.917
Baby, what are you doing?

2248
02:10:52.126 --> 02:10:53.559
The right thing.

2249
02:10:54.326 --> 02:10:55.964
I think the right thing.

2250
02:10:59.766 --> 02:11:00.755
Here they are.

2251
02:11:00.846 --> 02:11:02.757
- Are you gonna be disbarred?
- I don't know.

2252
02:11:02.846 --> 02:11:05.485
- How's it feel to lose your first case?
- No comment.

2253
02:11:05.566 --> 02:11:07.962
Ain't it better to talk
to them all at once?

2254
02:11:07.988 --> 02:11:09.425
Press conference tomorrow?

2255
02:11:09.566 --> 02:11:12.797
He ain't going to talk to you now.
Eight o'clock tomorrow morning.

2256
02:11:12.886 --> 02:11:14.160
That's it.

2257
02:11:14.326 --> 02:11:15.998
This is the story you dreamed about.

2258
02:11:16.086 --> 02:11:18.520
- There is no story.
- Bullshit.

2259
02:11:18.686 --> 02:11:21.962
A lawyer with a crisis of conscience?
You gotta be kidding. It's huge!

2260
02:11:22.046 --> 02:11:24.765
They're going to disbar me, Larry.
Write about that.

2261
02:11:25.726 --> 02:11:27.796
Wait a second.
Can they do that?

2262
02:11:27.966 --> 02:11:29.745
Not when I get through
with the story.

2263
02:11:29.826 --> 02:11:32.156
We've got the top, Kevin.
You got to give me an exclusive.

2264
02:11:32.226 --> 02:11:35.735
This is wire service.
This is "60 Minutes".

2265
02:11:35.806 --> 02:11:39.116
This is a story that needs to be told.
It's you.

2266
02:11:39.446 --> 02:11:40.925
You're a star.

2267
02:11:44.606 --> 02:11:46.134
Baby...

2268
02:11:48.086 --> 02:11:49.724
Call me in the morning.

2269
02:11:50.366 --> 02:11:52.880
You got it. First thing.

2270
02:11:53.605 --> 02:11:55.005
Bye Larry.

2271
02:12:02.206 --> 02:12:03.480
Vanity...

2272
02:12:03.926 --> 02:12:06.076
