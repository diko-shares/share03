WEBVTT

1
00:02:27.635 --> 00:02:28.889
It's beautiful here.

2
00:02:30.255 --> 00:02:33.669
It was our aunt’s. We used to come here as kids.

3
00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:36.756
The Order uses it now as a safe house.

4
00:02:38.883 --> 00:02:40.158
What's left of us at least.

5
00:02:42.977 --> 00:02:44.642
Muggles think these
things keep evil away.

6
00:02:45.505 --> 00:02:46.164
But they're wrong.

7
00:02:49.191 --> 00:02:50.421
I need to talk to the Goblin.

8
00:03:02.517 --> 00:03:03.373
How are you?

9
00:03:05.606 --> 00:03:06.352
Alive.

10
00:03:12.293 --> 00:03:13.290
You probably don't remember that you--

11
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.773
--That I showed you to your vault,
the first time you came to Gringotts.

12
00:03:17.057 --> 00:03:19.339
Even amongst Goblins, you are famous
Harry Potter.

13
00:03:23.647 --> 00:03:26.083
- You buried the elf?
- Yes.

14
00:03:27.061 --> 00:03:27.904
And brought me here.

15
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.793
You are...

16
00:03:33.996 --> 00:03:35.594
Pretty unusual, is it?

17
00:03:43.446 --> 00:03:44.912
How did you come by the sword?

18
00:03:49.731 --> 00:03:50.929
It's complicated.

19
00:03:53.214 --> 00:03:55.933
Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think
it should be in her vault at Gringotts?

20
00:03:57.855 --> 00:03:59.353
It's complicated.

21
00:04:03.077 --> 00:04:05.805
The sword presented itself to us,
in moment of need.

22
00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:07.786
We didn't steal it.

23
00:04:11.195 --> 00:04:14.215
There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's vault
identical to this one.

24
00:04:14.426 --> 00:04:15.674
But it is a fake.

25
00:04:16.613 --> 00:04:18.013
It was placed there this past summer.

26
00:04:18.017 --> 00:04:19.610
And she never suspected it was a fake.

27
00:04:19.842 --> 00:04:20.940
The replica is very convincing.

28
00:04:21.378 --> 00:04:24.543
Only a goblin would recognize that this is the true Sword of Gryffindor.

29
00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:26.275
Who is the acquaintance?

30
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.382
A Hogwarts Professor.

31
00:04:29.467 --> 00:04:31.158
As I understand that he's now Headmaster.

32
00:04:32.306 --> 00:04:32.886
Snape.

33
00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:36.198
He put a fake sword in Bellatrix's vault.

34
00:04:37.512 --> 00:04:38.120
Why?

35
00:04:38.726 --> 00:04:42.097
There are more than a few curious things
in the vaults at Gringotts.

36
00:04:43.743 --> 00:04:46.023
And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?

37
00:04:49.203 --> 00:04:50.079
Perhaps.

38
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.851
I need to get into Gringotts.
Into one of the vaults.

39
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.199
- It is impossible.
- Alone, yes.

40
00:04:59.575 --> 00:05:01.058
But with you, no.

41
00:05:06.718 --> 00:05:09.045
- Why should I help you?
- I have gold.

42
00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:10.770
Lots of it.

43
00:05:11.062 --> 00:05:12.094
I've no interest in gold.

44
00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:13.302
Then what?

45
00:05:18.955 --> 00:05:19.472
That.

46
00:05:21.072 --> 00:05:22.154
That is my price.

47
00:05:35.344 --> 00:05:37.526
Are you thinking there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?

48
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.975
Well, she was terrified when she thought we had been in there.

49
00:05:40.558 --> 00:05:41.995
She kept asking you,
what else was taken?

50
00:05:42.738 --> 00:05:45.397
I bet you anything, there's Horcrux in there.
Another piece of his soul.

51
00:05:45.644 --> 00:05:48.523
Let's find it, kill it, and we are
one step closer to killing him.

52
00:05:48.672 --> 00:05:49.663
And what happens when we find it,

53
00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:52.549
How're we supposed to destroy it, now you're giving the sword to Griphook?

54
00:05:54.122 --> 00:05:55.389
I'm still working on that part.

55
00:05:58.183 --> 00:05:58.693
He's weak.

56
00:06:08.737 --> 00:06:09.227
Who?

57
00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:12.302
Mr. Ollivander

58
00:06:13.645 --> 00:06:15.180
I need to ask you a few questions.

59
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.362
Anything, m'boy.
Anything!

60
00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:23.400
Would you mind identifying this wand?
We need to know if it's safe to use.

61
00:06:27.328 --> 00:06:30.955
Uhh... Walnut

62
00:06:32.773 --> 00:06:34.285
Dragon Heartstring

63
00:06:35.932 --> 00:06:37.474
12 and three quarter inches.

64
00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:40.144
Unyie...

65
00:06:43.215 --> 00:06:44.223
Unyielding.

66
00:06:45.828 --> 00:06:49.277
This belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.

67
00:06:53.436 --> 00:06:54.280
And this?

68
00:06:58.095 --> 00:06:58.565
Hawthorn.

69
00:07:01.091 --> 00:07:02.359
An unicorn hair.

70
00:07:03.732 --> 00:07:04.485
10 inches.

71
00:07:05.615 --> 00:07:07.220
Reasonably pliant.

72
00:07:11.654 --> 00:07:14.834
This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.

73
00:07:16.657 --> 00:07:17.123
Was?

74
00:07:18.003 --> 00:07:18.734
Is it not still?

75
00:07:19.269 --> 00:07:21.967
Well, perhaps not.
If you won it from him.

76
00:07:25.424 --> 00:07:27.889
I sense its allegiance has changed.

77
00:07:33.421 --> 00:07:36.948
You talk about wands,
as if they have feelings...

78
00:07:39.948 --> 00:07:40.694
.......can think!

79
00:07:44.428 --> 00:07:47.753
The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.

80
00:07:49.181 --> 00:07:53.562
That much has always been clear to
those of us who've studied wandlore.

81
00:07:55.537 --> 00:07:58.053
And, what do you know about the Deathly Hallows?

82
00:08:03.157 --> 00:08:05.081
It is rumored there are three.

83
00:08:07.964 --> 00:08:14.959
The Elder Wand, the Cloak of Invisibility,
to hide you from your enemies...

84
00:08:15.827 --> 00:08:20.459
and the Resurrection Stone, to bring
back loved ones from the dead.

85
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.537
Together, they make one the Master of Death.

86
00:08:26.805 --> 00:08:32.451
But few, truly believe that such objects exist.

87
00:08:32.547 --> 00:08:33.122
Do you?

88
00:08:34.737 --> 00:08:36.053
Do you believe they exist, sir?

89
00:08:38.463 --> 00:08:39.394
Well...

90
00:08:40.018 --> 00:08:45.333
I see no reason to put
stock into an old wives' tale.

91
00:08:46.879 --> 00:08:47.520
You're lying!

92
00:08:49.256 --> 00:08:50.559
You know one exists.

93
00:08:51.561 --> 00:08:55.722
You told him about it.
You told him about the Elder Wand...

94
00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.283
and where he could go looking for it.

95
00:09:01.966 --> 00:09:03.310
He tortured me.

96
00:09:06.695 --> 00:09:07.637
Besides...

97
00:09:09.422 --> 00:09:11.021
....I only conveyed rumors.

98
00:09:13.743 --> 00:09:14.272
There's...

99
00:09:16.528 --> 00:09:18.830
There's no telling whether he will find it.

100
00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:23.629
He has found it, sir.

101
00:09:29.751 --> 00:09:30.511
We'll let you rest.

102
00:09:33.842 --> 00:09:35.818
He's after you, Mr. Potter.

103
00:09:36.742 --> 00:09:38.902
If it's true what you say,

104
00:09:39.776 --> 00:09:41.428
that he has the Elder Wand,

105
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.025
I'm afraid,

106
00:09:46.316 --> 00:09:48.312
...you really don't stand a chance.

107
00:09:50.426 --> 00:09:52.370
Well, I suppose I'll have to kill him,
before he finds me, then.

108
00:09:58.668 --> 00:09:59.781
You're sure that's hers?

109
00:10:02.285 --> 00:10:02.996
Positive.

110
00:10:09.756 --> 00:10:10.405
Well?

111
00:10:12.301 --> 00:10:13.246
How do I look?

112
00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:15.064
Hideous.

113
00:10:16.833 --> 00:10:19.195
You can give that to Hermione to hold.
Alright, Griphook?

114
00:10:38.967 --> 00:10:39.933
We're relying on you, Griphook.

115
00:10:40.095 --> 00:10:41.932
If you get us past the guards into the vault...

116
00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:42.951
The sword's yours.

117
00:10:56.108 --> 00:10:56.951
Madam Lestrange.

118
00:10:57.433 --> 00:10:58.034
Good morning.

119
00:11:00.396 --> 00:11:03.007
Good morning?
Good morning?

120
00:11:03.773 --> 00:11:06.300
You're Bellatrix Lestrange,
not some school girl!

121
00:11:06.383 --> 00:11:07.710
Hey!
Easy!

122
00:11:08.797 --> 00:11:12.891
If she gives us away, we must swear
to use that sword to slit our own throats.

123
00:11:13.633 --> 00:11:14.346
Understand?

124
00:11:15.366 --> 00:11:16.273
No, he's right.

125
00:11:16.764 --> 00:11:17.739
I speak stupid.

126
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:21.344
Okay.
Let's do it.

127
00:12:24.229 --> 00:12:26.585
I wish to enter my vault.

128
00:12:30.156 --> 00:12:31.938
Identification?

129
00:12:35.266 --> 00:12:37.139
I hardly think that would be necessary.

130
00:12:40.211 --> 00:12:41.358
Madam Lestrange.

131
00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:48.719
I don't like to be kept waiting.

132
00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.333
<i>I know...</i>

133
00:12:51.427 --> 00:12:52.654
<i>They know she's an impostor.</i>

134
00:12:56.229 --> 00:12:57.280
<i>They'd be warned.</i>

135
00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:06.062
Harry...

136
00:13:07.646 --> 00:13:08.654
What do we do, Harry?

137
00:13:15.002 --> 00:13:18.400
Madam Lestrange,
would you mind presenting your wand?

138
00:13:19.415 --> 00:13:20.850
And why should I do that?

139
00:13:20.855 --> 00:13:25.468
It's the bank's policy!
I'm sure you understand, given current climate.

140
00:13:26.775 --> 00:13:29.354
No! I most certainly do not understand!

141
00:13:29.761 --> 00:13:32.647
I'm afraid, I must insist.

142
00:13:38.462 --> 00:13:39.260
<i>Imperio!</i>

143
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.383
Very well, Madam Lestrange.

144
00:13:47.939 --> 00:13:49.032
If you will follow me?

145
00:14:24.516 --> 00:14:25.181
What is that, Griphook?

146
00:14:30.595 --> 00:14:31.036
Griphook!

147
00:14:49.579 --> 00:14:51.322
<i>Aresto Momentum</i>

148
00:14:55.965 --> 00:14:56.820
Well done, Hermione.

149
00:15:05.203 --> 00:15:06.595
Oh no, you two're like you again.

150
00:15:07.554 --> 00:15:10.802
The Thief's Downfall,
washes away all enchantments.

151
00:15:11.541 --> 00:15:12.359
Can be deadly.

152
00:15:12.751 --> 00:15:13.434
You don't say.

153
00:15:14.382 --> 00:15:16.457
Just out of interest,
is there any other way out of here?

154
00:15:17.446 --> 00:15:17.849
No.

155
00:15:19.972 --> 00:15:22.994
What the devil are all you doing down here?

156
00:15:23.832 --> 00:15:24.461
Thieves!

157
00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:25.835
You gave up the.....

158
00:15:25.835 --> 00:15:26.727
<i>-Imperio
-You!</i>

159
00:15:38.102 --> 00:15:39.004
That doesn't sound good.

160
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:50.816
Bloody hell!

161
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.567
That's an Ukrainian Ironbelly.

162
00:15:52.929 --> 00:15:53.307
Here.

163
00:16:04.733 --> 00:16:07.094
It's been trained to expect pain
when it hears the noise.

164
00:16:08.014 --> 00:16:08.634
That's barbaric!

165
00:16:37.989 --> 00:16:38.618
<i>Lumos</i>

166
00:16:43.809 --> 00:16:44.440
Blimey!

167
00:16:52.158 --> 00:16:53.103
<i>Accio Horcrux</i>

168
00:16:55.753 --> 00:16:57.175
You seem you're gonna try
that one to get over here?

169
00:16:57.672 --> 00:16:59.309
No kind of magic would work in here.

170
00:17:04.391 --> 00:17:05.388
It's in here, Harry?

171
00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.081
Can you feel anything?

172
00:17:29.393 --> 00:17:31.459
That's it!
Up there!

173
00:17:35.265 --> 00:17:38.169
They have added the Gemino curse.
Everything you touch will multiply.

174
00:17:38.693 --> 00:17:39.345
Give me the sword.

175
00:17:57.128 --> 00:17:58.097
Stop moving!

176
00:18:20.451 --> 00:18:20.937
Do it!

177
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:26.822
- We had deal, Griphook!
- The cup for the sword!

178
00:18:32.977 --> 00:18:36.774
I said I'll get you in,
I didn't say anything about getting you out.

179
00:18:58.607 --> 00:19:00.453
Griphook! Thieves!
Griphook!

180
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:01.808
Hey, thieves!

181
00:19:05.442 --> 00:19:06.389
Is that okay?

182
00:19:07.219 --> 00:19:08.181
We've still got Bogrod.

183
00:19:15.546 --> 00:19:16.513
That's unfortunate.

184
00:19:20.914 --> 00:19:22.841
We can't just stand here,
You got any idea?

185
00:19:23.296 --> 00:19:24.146
You're the brilliant one.

186
00:19:24.669 --> 00:19:26.582
I've got something,
but it's mad!

187
00:19:27.386 --> 00:19:28.102
<i>Reducto</i>

188
00:19:40.494 --> 00:19:41.527
Well, come on, then!

189
00:19:44.035 --> 00:19:44.904
<i>Relashio</i>

190
00:20:30.707 --> 00:20:31.387
Keep moving!

191
00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:58.795
Now what?

192
00:20:59.286 --> 00:21:00.024
<i>Reducto</i>

193
00:21:01.877 --> 00:21:02.478
Hold on.

194
00:21:12.178 --> 00:21:14.845
That was brilliant!
Absolutely brilliant!

195
00:21:42.266 --> 00:21:43.088
We're dropping!

196
00:21:46.773 --> 00:21:48.440
- I say we jump!
- When?

197
00:21:49.002 --> 00:21:49.603
Now!

198
00:22:42.581 --> 00:22:43.063
He knows.

199
00:22:43.947 --> 00:22:44.655
You-Know-Who.

200
00:22:45.572 --> 00:22:46.773
He knows we broke into Gringotts.

201
00:22:47.248 --> 00:22:49.820
He knows what we took,
and he knows we're hunting Horcruxes.

202
00:22:50.467 --> 00:22:51.762
- How is it you know?
- I saw him.

203
00:22:52.385 --> 00:22:54.856
You let him in?
Harry, you can't do that!

204
00:22:54.872 --> 00:22:56.379
Hermione, I can't always help it!

205
00:22:56.858 --> 00:22:58.263
Well, maybe I can.
I don't know!

206
00:22:58.579 --> 00:22:59.555
Never mind!
What happened?

207
00:23:00.096 --> 00:23:01.675
Well, he's angry...

208
00:23:02.238 --> 00:23:03.136
and scared too.

209
00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.452
He knows, if we find and destroy
all the Horcruxes, we'll be able to kill him.

210
00:23:07.202 --> 00:23:09.595
I reckon he'll stop at nothing
to make sure we don't find the rest.

211
00:23:11.848 --> 00:23:12.486
And there's more.

212
00:23:12.854 --> 00:23:13.807
One of them is at Hogwarts.

213
00:23:14.229 --> 00:23:14.790
What?

214
00:23:15.854 --> 00:23:16.709
You saw it?

215
00:23:16.709 --> 00:23:17.568
I saw the castle.

216
00:23:17.568 --> 00:23:18.561
And Rowena Ravenclaw.

217
00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:19.993
It must have something to do with her.

218
00:23:19.998 --> 00:23:21.064
We have to go there, now!

219
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.433
Well, we can't do that!

220
00:23:23.054 --> 00:23:24.790
We've got to plan,
we've got to figure it out!

221
00:23:24.796 --> 00:23:27.607
Hermione, when have any of
our plans ever actually worked?

222
00:23:27.848 --> 00:23:29.721
We plan, we get there,
all hell breaks loose.

223
00:23:31.228 --> 00:23:33.235
He's right!
One problem...

224
00:23:34.017 --> 00:23:36.628
Snape's Headmaster now,
we can't just move from the front door!

225
00:23:37.989 --> 00:23:40.121
Well, we'll go to Hogsmeade,

226
00:23:40.586 --> 00:23:41.360
to Honeydukes.

227
00:23:41.609 --> 00:23:42.898
Take the secret passage in the cellar.

228
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.391
It's...

229
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.414
There's something wrong with him.

230
00:23:47.344 --> 00:23:48.535
It's like, you know,
in the past...

231
00:23:49.545 --> 00:23:51.166
I've always been able
to follow his thoughts.

232
00:23:51.759 --> 00:23:53.445
And now everything just feels disconnected.

233
00:23:54.606 --> 00:23:56.726
Maybe it's the Horcruxes.
Maybe he's growing weaker.

234
00:23:56.743 --> 00:23:57.555
Maybe he's dying!

235
00:23:58.010 --> 00:23:58.375
No!

236
00:23:59.007 --> 00:24:00.480
No, it's.. it's more like he's wounded.

237
00:24:01.352 --> 00:24:02.927
If anything, he feels more dangerous.

238
00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:53.185
- Right here. Come on!
- Search everywhere.

239
00:24:53.274 --> 00:24:53.699
Go, move!

240
00:25:12.681 --> 00:25:13.730
Faster!

241
00:25:26.183 --> 00:25:27.064
In here, Potter.

242
00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:32.651
<i>Come on, move!</i>

243
00:25:40.577 --> 00:25:41.427
Did you look at him?

244
00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:45.074
- For a second I thought that was...
- I know. Dumbledore!

245
00:26:01.116 --> 00:26:01.683
Harry?

246
00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:05.481
I can see you in this.

247
00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.326
Bloody fools, what were you thinking, coming here?

248
00:26:21.739 --> 00:26:23.882
Have you any idea how dangerous it is?

249
00:26:24.022 --> 00:26:26.604
You're Aberforth, Dumbledore's brother.

250
00:26:28.178 --> 00:26:29.575
It's you who I've been seeing in here.

251
00:26:30.723 --> 00:26:31.753
You're the one who sent Dobby.

252
00:26:32.345 --> 00:26:34.557
- Why've you left him?
- He's dead.

253
00:26:35.828 --> 00:26:37.542
Sorry to hear it.
I liked that elf.

254
00:26:37.809 --> 00:26:38.684
Who gave that to you?

255
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:39.605
The mirror?

256
00:26:41.209 --> 00:26:43.496
Mundungus Fletcher, 'bout a year ago.

257
00:26:43.504 --> 00:26:45.242
Dung had no right selling that to you.
It belongs to...

258
00:26:45.247 --> 00:26:45.790
Sirius...

259
00:26:47.246 --> 00:26:48.421
Albus told me.

260
00:26:49.434 --> 00:26:51.993
He also told me you'd likely be hacked off,

261
00:26:52.247 --> 00:26:54.822
...if you ever found that I had it.
But, ask yourself;

262
00:26:55.546 --> 00:26:57.486
Where would you be if I didn't?

263
00:27:01.499 --> 00:27:02.428
Do you have any others much?

264
00:27:02.762 --> 00:27:03.394
From the Order?

265
00:27:04.111 --> 00:27:05.168
The Order's finished.

266
00:27:06.109 --> 00:27:07.115
You-Know-Who's won,

267
00:27:07.693 --> 00:27:10.498
...anyone who says otherwise
is killing themselves.

268
00:27:11.018 --> 00:27:13.152
We need to get into Hogwarts, tonight.

269
00:27:13.954 --> 00:27:15.247
Dumbledore gave us a job to do.

270
00:27:15.663 --> 00:27:16.484
Did he now...

271
00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:19.590
Nice job?
Easy?

272
00:27:20.388 --> 00:27:21.676
We've been hunting Horcruxes.

273
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.782
And we think the last one's inside
the castle.

274
00:27:24.889 --> 00:27:26.318
But we'll need your help getting in.

275
00:27:26.325 --> 00:27:29.730
Which job my brother has given you no,
it's a suicide mission.

276
00:27:30.039 --> 00:27:31.886
Do yourself a favor, boy.
Go home!

277
00:27:32.406 --> 00:27:33.256
Live a little longer.

278
00:27:33.448 --> 00:27:35.032
Dumbledore trusted me to see this through.

279
00:27:35.169 --> 00:27:36.964
What makes you think you can trust him?

280
00:27:38.302 --> 00:27:40.707
What makes you think you can believe
anything my brother told you?

281
00:27:40.952 --> 00:27:41.927
And in all the time you knew him...

282
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:43.972
Did he ever mention my name?

283
00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.813
Did he ever mentioned hers?

284
00:27:47.625 --> 00:27:49.253
- Why should he...
- Keep secrets.

285
00:27:49.254 --> 00:27:50.636
You tell me?

286
00:27:52.148 --> 00:27:54.497
- I trusted him.
- That's a boy's answer.

287
00:27:55.803 --> 00:28:00.138
A boy goes chasing Horcruxes on the word of
a man who wouldn't even tell him where to start.

288
00:28:00.383 --> 00:28:01.151
You're lying!

289
00:28:02.179 --> 00:28:05.578
Not just on me, that doesn't matter.
To yourself as well.

290
00:28:05.982 --> 00:28:07.172
That's what a fool does.

291
00:28:08.051 --> 00:28:11.446
You don't strike me as a fool, Harry Potter!

292
00:28:11.976 --> 00:28:15.327
So, I'll ask you again, there must be a reason.

293
00:28:18.238 --> 00:28:20.357
I'm not interested in what happened
between you and your brother.

294
00:28:22.105 --> 00:28:23.483
I don't care that you've given up.

295
00:28:26.589 --> 00:28:28.087
I trusted the man I knew.

296
00:28:32.096 --> 00:28:33.666
We need to get into the castle tonight.

297
00:28:40.167 --> 00:28:41.456
You know what to do.

298
00:28:48.788 --> 00:28:49.688
Where've you sent her?

299
00:28:51.081 --> 00:28:51.770
You'll see.

300
00:28:52.776 --> 00:28:53.675
Soon enough.

301
00:29:00.592 --> 00:29:02.195
That's your sister, Ariana.
Isn't it?

302
00:29:04.064 --> 00:29:05.643
She died very young, didn't she?

303
00:29:07.545 --> 00:29:10.756
My brother sacrificed many things, Mr. Potter.

304
00:29:11.396 --> 00:29:13.035
On his journey to find power.

305
00:29:14.008 --> 00:29:15.081
Including Ariana.

306
00:29:16.283 --> 00:29:18.141
And she was devoted to him.

307
00:29:19.743 --> 00:29:20.964
He gave her everything,

308
00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:23.802
...but time.

309
00:29:26.106 --> 00:29:27.284
Thank you, Mr. Dumbledore.

310
00:29:34.922 --> 00:29:36.282
He did save our lives twice!

311
00:29:37.841 --> 00:29:38.906
Kept an eye on us on that mirror.

312
00:29:41.267 --> 00:29:42.988
That doesn't seem like someone who's given up!

313
00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:50.000
She's coming back.

314
00:29:51.967 --> 00:29:52.646
What's that with her?

315
00:30:01.263 --> 00:30:01.701
Neville!

316
00:30:02.127 --> 00:30:03.674
- How you look...
- Like hell, I reckon.

317
00:30:04.864 --> 00:30:05.489
This is nothing.

318
00:30:06.189 --> 00:30:06.956
Seamus is worse.

319
00:30:07.722 --> 00:30:08.620
Hey, Ab!

320
00:30:08.877 --> 00:30:10.217
We've got a couple more coming through.

321
00:30:12.565 --> 00:30:13.824
Don't remember this on the Marauder's Map.

322
00:30:14.407 --> 00:30:15.784
That's because it never existed till now.

323
00:30:16.435 --> 00:30:19.029
The seven secret passages were sealed off,
before the start of the year.

324
00:30:19.642 --> 00:30:20.783
This is the only way in or out, now.

325
00:30:21.899 --> 00:30:23.692
The grounds are crawled with Death Eaters and Dementors.

326
00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:25.774
How about Mr.Snape as Headmaster?

327
00:30:26.009 --> 00:30:26.777
Hardly ever seen.

328
00:30:27.027 --> 00:30:28.467
It's the Carrows who's watch out for.

329
00:30:29.245 --> 00:30:29.764
Carrows?

330
00:30:30.033 --> 00:30:32.282
Yeah. Brother and sister.
Incharge of discipline.

331
00:30:32.829 --> 00:30:33.964
They like punishment, the Carrows.

332
00:30:34.651 --> 00:30:35.327
They did that to you?

333
00:30:35.948 --> 00:30:36.398
Why?

334
00:30:36.764 --> 00:30:39.587
Today's Dark Arts lesson was
practicing the Cruciatus curse.

335
00:30:40.394 --> 00:30:41.192
On first years.

336
00:30:42.376 --> 00:30:43.004
I refused.

337
00:30:44.884 --> 00:30:45.920
Hogwarts has changed.

338
00:30:59.223 --> 00:31:00.727
Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?

339
00:31:06.551 --> 00:31:08.062
Hey, listen up you lot!

340
00:31:08.626 --> 00:31:09.520
I've for you a surprise.

341
00:31:09.596 --> 00:31:11.261
No more Aberforth's cook gonna help.

342
00:31:11.891 --> 00:31:13.216
We'll be surprised if we can digest that.

343
00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:18.198
- Oh my!
- Harry!

344
00:31:31.859 --> 00:31:33.927
Get the word out to Remus and the others,
that Harry is back.

345
00:31:34.661 --> 00:31:35.344
Okay, okay!

346
00:31:35.849 --> 00:31:37.146
Let's not kill him before You-Know-Who does.

347
00:31:37.156 --> 00:31:41.291
...Do you read? We've a new weather report.
Lightning has struck. I repeat: Lightning has struck.

348
00:31:41.291 --> 00:31:41.919
What's the fun, Harry?

349
00:31:48.083 --> 00:31:48.710
Okay.

350
00:31:49.821 --> 00:31:51.082
There's something we need to find.

351
00:31:52.079 --> 00:31:53.884
Something hidden here, in the castle.

352
00:31:54.354 --> 00:31:55.992
And it may help us to defeat
You-Know-Who.

353
00:31:56.953 --> 00:31:59.410
- Alright, what is it?
- We don't know.

354
00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:03.728
- Where is it?
- We don't know that either.

355
00:32:05.992 --> 00:32:07.078
I realize there's not much to go on.

356
00:32:07.193 --> 00:32:08.000
That's nothing to go on.

357
00:32:09.057 --> 00:32:10.864
I think it has something to do with Ravenclaw.

358
00:32:12.011 --> 00:32:15.768
It'll be small, easily concealed.

359
00:32:17.016 --> 00:32:18.176
Anyone, any ideas?

360
00:32:20.406 --> 00:32:22.620
Well, there's Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem.

361
00:32:22.843 --> 00:32:23.865
Oh, bloody hell!
Here we go!

362
00:32:25.448 --> 00:32:26.884
Lost diadem of Ravenclaw?

363
00:32:27.985 --> 00:32:29.267
Hasn't anyone heard of this?

364
00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:31.103
It's quite famous.

365
00:32:31.774 --> 00:32:33.533
Yes. But, Luna, it's lost.

366
00:32:33.879 --> 00:32:37.179
For centuries.
There's no person alive today who's seen it.

367
00:32:38.056 --> 00:32:39.806
Excuse me, can someone tell me what bloody diadem is?

368
00:32:40.303 --> 00:32:41.565
It's a sort of crown.

369
00:32:41.839 --> 00:32:42.817
You know, like a tiara.

370
00:32:46.031 --> 00:32:46.675
Harry!

371
00:32:48.225 --> 00:32:49.019
Hi, there.

372
00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:55.244
Six months she doesn't see me and
it's like I'm a frankie first-year.

373
00:32:55.869 --> 00:32:56.580
I'm her brother!

374
00:32:56.584 --> 00:32:59.216
- She's got lots of them, but she's got only one Harry.
- Shut up, Seamus!

375
00:33:00.131 --> 00:33:00.730
What is it, Ginny?

376
00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:04.834
Snape knows... he knows
that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.

377
00:33:43.233 --> 00:33:47.428
Many of you are surely wondering,
why I have summoned you at this hour.

378
00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.276
It's come to my attention,
that earlier this evening...

379
00:33:55.675 --> 00:33:57.590
Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade.

380
00:34:00.342 --> 00:34:01.011
Now...

381
00:34:02.137 --> 00:34:03.290
should anyone...

382
00:34:04.969 --> 00:34:10.076
student or staff attempt to aid Mr. Potter?

383
00:34:11.375 --> 00:34:19.050
They will be punished in a manner consistent with
the severity of their transcription, further more...

384
00:34:20.411 --> 00:34:23.864
Any person found to have
knowledge of these events...

385
00:34:26.125 --> 00:34:29.279
who fails to come forward...

386
00:34:30.878 --> 00:34:38.120
...will be treated as equally guilty.

387
00:34:41.057 --> 00:34:41.830
Another...

388
00:34:46.425 --> 00:34:53.559
If anyone in here has any knowledge of
Mr. Potter's movements this evening.

389
00:34:56.652 --> 00:34:59.343
I invite them to step forward.

390
00:35:03.614 --> 00:35:04.839
Now!

391
00:35:19.468 --> 00:35:22.752
It seems, despite your exhaustive defensive strategies,

392
00:35:23.309 --> 00:35:25.375
...you still have a bit of security problem, Headmaster.

393
00:35:29.321 --> 00:35:30.763
I'm afraid it's quite extensive.

394
00:35:32.672 --> 00:35:34.458
How dare you stand where he stood?

395
00:35:36.398 --> 00:35:40.023
Tell them how it happened that night?
Tell them how you looked him in the eye...

396
00:35:40.373 --> 00:35:42.591
A man who trusted you, and killed him.

397
00:35:43.279 --> 00:35:43.796
Tell them!

398
00:36:09.114 --> 00:36:09.675
COWARD!!!

399
00:36:18.669 --> 00:36:20.427
<i>Harry.</i>

400
00:36:21.886 --> 00:36:22.486
Potter?

401
00:36:56.264 --> 00:37:00.939
<i>I know that many of you will want to fight.</i>

402
00:37:01.641 --> 00:37:06.699
<i>Some of you may even think that to fight is wise.</i>

403
00:37:06.923 --> 00:37:08.637
<i>But this is folly.</i>

404
00:37:10.284 --> 00:37:12.756
<i>Give me Harry Potter.</i>

405
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.540
<i>Do this and none shall be harmed.</i>

406
00:37:17.956 --> 00:37:23.930
<i>Give me Harry Potter,
and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched.</i>

407
00:37:24.236 --> 00:37:30.910
<i>Give me Harry Potter,
and you will be rewarded.</i>

408
00:37:31.026 --> 00:37:33.576
<i>You have one hour.</i>

409
00:37:43.759 --> 00:37:46.556
What're you waiting for?
Someone grab him!

410
00:37:55.771 --> 00:38:00.012
Students out of bed!
Students out of bed!

411
00:38:00.717 --> 00:38:02.186
Students in the corridor!

412
00:38:02.186 --> 00:38:05.197
They're supposed to be out of bed,
you blithering idiot!

413
00:38:08.793 --> 00:38:09.649
Sorry ma'am.

414
00:38:09.945 --> 00:38:11.225
As it happens, Mr. Filch...

415
00:38:11.491 --> 00:38:13.102
Your arrival is most opportune.

416
00:38:13.892 --> 00:38:20.215
If you would, I would like you please, to lead Miss Parkinson
and the rest of Slytherin house, from the hall.

417
00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.044
Exactly where is it I'll be leading 'em to, ma'am?

418
00:38:23.101 --> 00:38:24.458
The dungeons would do.

419
00:38:30.141 --> 00:38:32.403
I presume you have a reason for returning, Potter.

420
00:38:32.445 --> 00:38:33.512
What is it you need?

421
00:38:33.655 --> 00:38:36.192
Time, Professor.
As much as you can get me.

422
00:38:36.939 --> 00:38:37.853
Do what you have to do.

423
00:38:38.341 --> 00:38:39.563
I'll secure the castle.

424
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.798
Potter...

425
00:38:44.679 --> 00:38:45.565
It's good to see you.

426
00:38:47.185 --> 00:38:48.420
It's good to see you too, Professor.

427
00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:50.929
Hold the fort, Neville.

428
00:39:03.116 --> 00:39:03.506
Harry!

429
00:39:04.499 --> 00:39:07.290
Hermione and I've been thinking,
it doesn't matter if we find a Horcrux.

430
00:39:07.725 --> 00:39:08.381
What do you mean?

431
00:39:08.618 --> 00:39:09.910
Unless we can destroy it.

432
00:39:10.222 --> 00:39:11.395
So, we were thinking...

433
00:39:11.403 --> 00:39:12.809
Well, Ron was thinking, it was Ron's idea.

434
00:39:12.809 --> 00:39:13.631
It's completely brilliant.

435
00:39:14.015 --> 00:39:16.149
You destroyed Tom Riddle's diary
with a Basilisk's fang, right?

436
00:39:17.232 --> 00:39:19.321
Well, me and Hermione did remind
where we might find one.

437
00:39:19.571 --> 00:39:20.109
Okay.

438
00:39:21.457 --> 00:39:22.420
Okay, but take this.

439
00:39:23.017 --> 00:39:24.270
That way, you can find me when you get back.

440
00:39:25.022 --> 00:39:25.874
Where're you going?

441
00:39:25.882 --> 00:39:28.012
Ravenclaw common room,
Gotta start somewhere.

442
00:39:34.613 --> 00:39:35.093
Harry!

443
00:39:36.437 --> 00:39:36.932
Harry!

444
00:39:38.012 --> 00:39:39.063
Let me get this straight, Professor...

445
00:39:39.645 --> 00:39:41.159
You're actually giving us
permission to do this?

446
00:39:41.488 --> 00:39:43.094
That is correct, Longbottom.

447
00:39:43.668 --> 00:39:44.726
To blow it up!
Boom!

448
00:39:45.104 --> 00:39:45.685
Boom!

449
00:39:46.688 --> 00:39:47.353
Wicked!

450
00:39:48.057 --> 00:39:49.145
But how on earth are we gonna do that?

451
00:39:50.083 --> 00:39:51.959
Why don't you confer with Mr. Finnigan?

452
00:39:52.474 --> 00:39:56.009
As I recall, he has a particular
proclivity for pyro-technics.

453
00:39:56.027 --> 00:39:56.914
I can bring it down.

454
00:39:57.112 --> 00:39:58.378
That's the spirit!
Away, you go.

455
00:40:00.361 --> 00:40:03.603
You do realize, of course, we can't
keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely.

456
00:40:03.805 --> 00:40:05.658
That doesn't mean
we can't delay him.

457
00:40:07.449 --> 00:40:11.442
And his name is Voldemort.
Filius, you might as well use it.

458
00:40:11.919 --> 00:40:14.147
He's come to try to kill you, either way!

459
00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:19.615
<i>Piertotum Locomotor.</i>

460
00:40:35.014 --> 00:40:36.277
Hogwarts is threatened.

461
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:40.100
Man the boundaries! Protect us.
Do your duty...

462
00:40:40.391 --> 00:40:41.767
....to our school.

463
00:40:45.711 --> 00:40:48.181
I've always wanted to use
that spell!

464
00:40:57.868 --> 00:40:58.603
<i>Protego Maxima</i>

465
00:40:58.800 --> 00:40:59.578
<i>Fianto Duri</i>

466
00:40:59.895 --> 00:41:00.549
<i>Repello Inimigotum</i>

467
00:41:00.667 --> 00:41:02.157
<i>Protego Maxima</i>

468
00:41:02.943 --> 00:41:04.256
<i>Fianto Duri</i>

469
00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:05.311
<i>Repello....</i>

470
00:41:05.426 --> 00:41:06.232
<i>Protego Maxima</i>

471
00:41:06.693 --> 00:41:07.513
<i>Fianto Duri</i>

472
00:41:08.105 --> 00:41:09.899
<i>Repello Inimigotum</i>

473
00:41:09.999 --> 00:41:11.004
<i>Protego Maxima</i>

474
00:41:38.651 --> 00:41:40.020
Harry, wait!

475
00:41:40.639 --> 00:41:41.638
I need to talk to you!

476
00:41:41.642 --> 00:41:44.336
- I'm a bit pre-occupied at the moment, Luna.
- You don't know anything where you're going.

477
00:41:44.339 --> 00:41:45.239
You're wasting your time!

478
00:41:45.691 --> 00:41:46.958
Look, we'll talk later,
okay, Luna?

479
00:41:46.958 --> 00:41:48.303
- Harry?
- Later.

480
00:41:48.417 --> 00:41:50.591
Harry Potter, you listen to me right now!

481
00:41:52.777 --> 00:41:55.547
Do you remember what Cho said
about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem?

482
00:41:56.023 --> 00:41:57.713
There is not a person alive who's seen it.

483
00:41:59.307 --> 00:42:00.346
It's obvious, isn't it?

484
00:42:01.074 --> 00:42:02.836
We have to talk to someone who's dead.

485
00:42:13.567 --> 00:42:15.013
It's very impressive, isn't it?

486
00:42:30.838 --> 00:42:33.459
If you've to find her,
you'll find her down there.

487
00:42:33.569 --> 00:42:34.822
- Aren't you coming?
- No.

488
00:42:35.086 --> 00:42:36.927
I think it's best if you two talk alone.

489
00:42:37.621 --> 00:42:38.588
She's very shy.

490
00:43:05.157 --> 00:43:06.049
You're the Grey Lady.

491
00:43:07.487 --> 00:43:08.948
The ghost of Ravenclaw tower.

492
00:43:09.301 --> 00:43:11.020
I do not answer to that name!

493
00:43:11.241 --> 00:43:12.585
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

494
00:43:13.017 --> 00:43:14.134
It's Helena, isn't it?

495
00:43:14.698 --> 00:43:17.063
Helena Ravenclaw,
Rowena's daughter.

496
00:43:18.193 --> 00:43:19.614
Are you a friend of Luna's?

497
00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:20.819
Yes.

498
00:43:22.009 --> 00:43:23.583
And she thought you might be able to help me.

499
00:43:26.269 --> 00:43:28.175
You seek my mother's diadem?

500
00:43:30.227 --> 00:43:30.950
Yes.

501
00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:33.435
That's right.

502
00:43:35.449 --> 00:43:36.837
Luna is kind.

503
00:43:37.408 --> 00:43:39.233
Unlike so many of the others.

504
00:43:40.058 --> 00:43:43.035
But she was wrong,
I cannot help you!

505
00:43:47.472 --> 00:43:48.857
Wait, please!

506
00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:52.854
I want to destroy it!

507
00:44:29.858 --> 00:44:31.280
They never learn.

508
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:34.338
Such a pity.

509
00:44:35.543 --> 00:44:37.398
But, my Lord...

510
00:44:38.893 --> 00:44:40.047
Shouldn't we wait?

511
00:44:41.228 --> 00:44:41.846
My Lord!

512
00:44:47.854 --> 00:44:48.607
Begin!

513
00:45:09.076 --> 00:45:10.286
I thought you want to do it.
Isn't it, Helena?

514
00:45:16.566 --> 00:45:17.645
You want to destroy it?

515
00:45:17.968 --> 00:45:20.394
Another swore to destroy it,
many years ago.

516
00:45:21.286 --> 00:45:23.518
A strange boy with a strange name.

517
00:45:24.037 --> 00:45:24.682
Tom Riddle.

518
00:45:24.863 --> 00:45:25.889
But he lied.

519
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:27.915
He's lied to many people.

520
00:45:28.027 --> 00:45:30.965
I know what he's done!
I know who he is!

521
00:45:31.321 --> 00:45:34.283
He defiled it, with dark magic!

522
00:45:48.485 --> 00:45:49.793
I can destroy it.

523
00:45:50.161 --> 00:45:51.337
Once and for all.

524
00:45:53.882 --> 00:45:55.687
But only if you tell me
where he hid it?

525
00:45:58.607 --> 00:46:01.845
You do know, where he hid it?

526
00:46:02.357 --> 00:46:03.134
Don't you, Helena?

527
00:46:05.684 --> 00:46:06.814
You just have to tell me.

528
00:46:09.367 --> 00:46:10.197
Please!

529
00:46:22.382 --> 00:46:23.677
Strange!

530
00:46:27.396 --> 00:46:29.464
You remind me of him a bit.

531
00:46:31.428 --> 00:46:34.403
It's here, in the castle.

532
00:46:35.401 --> 00:46:37.253
In the place where everything is hidden.

533
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:40.739
If you have to ask...

534
00:46:41.262 --> 00:46:42.293
....you will never know.

535
00:46:44.143 --> 00:46:45.038
If you know...

536
00:46:45.679 --> 00:46:47.033
...you need only ask.

537
00:46:49.184 --> 00:46:49.883
Thank you!

538
00:47:03.156 --> 00:47:06.035
Tell Professor McGonagall.
Remus and I will handle this side of the castle.

539
00:47:08.006 --> 00:47:08.669
Yes, sir!

540
00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:18.158
Hey Dean, on second thoughts, tell Professor McGonagall we
might need one or two more wands this side.

541
00:47:20.729 --> 00:47:23.681
It is the quality of one's convictions that determine
his success..

542
00:47:23.764 --> 00:47:25.331
...not the number of followers.

543
00:47:26.059 --> 00:47:26.862
Who said that?

544
00:47:28.219 --> 00:47:28.729
Me.

545
00:47:34.269 --> 00:47:35.120
You okay, Freddie?

546
00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:36.887
Yeah.

547
00:47:39.262 --> 00:47:39.939
Me too.

548
00:47:57.248 --> 00:47:58.304
Harry talks in his sleep.

549
00:47:58.929 --> 00:47:59.606
Do you know this?

550
00:48:01.637 --> 00:48:02.693
No, of course, not!

551
00:48:48.987 --> 00:48:51.995
Yeah?
You and whose army?

552
00:49:11.449 --> 00:49:12.141
You do it.

553
00:49:12.606 --> 00:49:13.321
I can't.

554
00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:14.025
Yes, you can!

555
00:52:05.777 --> 00:52:06.540
Neville!

556
00:52:24.022 --> 00:52:24.821
That went well.

557
00:53:10.038 --> 00:53:13.996
Get inside! This way!
Take cover! Take cover

558
00:53:30.818 --> 00:53:31.581
<i>Stupefy</i>

559
00:53:35.485 --> 00:53:38.200
Ginny, Neville!
You alright?

560
00:53:38.645 --> 00:53:39.322
Never better!

561
00:53:39.739 --> 00:53:41.214
I feel like I can spit fire!

562
00:53:41.689 --> 00:53:42.640
Have you seen Luna up here?

563
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:43.475
Luna?

564
00:53:44.051 --> 00:53:48.062
I'm mad for her. I think it’s about time I told her
since we’ll probably both be dead by dawn.

565
00:53:52.982 --> 00:53:53.606
I know.

566
00:54:21.455 --> 00:54:23.213
Bloody hell!
We'll never find him on this.

567
00:54:23.922 --> 00:54:24.715
Here he is!

568
00:54:25.170 --> 00:54:26.493
- Just now...
- Brilliant!

569
00:54:26.793 --> 00:54:27.728
He just vanished.

570
00:54:28.483 --> 00:54:29.435
I just now I saw it.

571
00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:34.321
Maybe he's gone to the Room of Requirement.

572
00:54:34.869 --> 00:54:36.005
It doesn't show up on the map, does it?

573
00:54:36.347 --> 00:54:37.274
You said that last year.

574
00:54:38.515 --> 00:54:39.800
That's right, I....I did.

575
00:54:40.918 --> 00:54:41.499
Let's go.

576
00:54:43.223 --> 00:54:43.910
Brilliant!

577
00:54:50.281 --> 00:54:51.769
Come on!

578
00:56:39.358 --> 00:56:40.070
Well, well...

579
00:56:41.586 --> 00:56:42.772
What brings you here, Potter?

580
00:56:44.409 --> 00:56:45.379
I could ask you the same.

581
00:56:46.618 --> 00:56:47.765
You have something of mine.

582
00:56:49.499 --> 00:56:50.511
I'd like it back.

583
00:56:50.838 --> 00:56:51.815
What's wrong with the one you have?

584
00:56:52.188 --> 00:56:52.973
It's my mother's.

585
00:56:53.594 --> 00:56:54.793
It's powerful, but it's...

586
00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:56.432
..not the same.

587
00:56:57.469 --> 00:56:59.983
Doesn't quite understand me.

588
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:02.063
You know what I mean?

589
00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:04.427
Why didn't you tell her?

590
00:57:06.976 --> 00:57:07.709
Bellatrix?

591
00:57:11.384 --> 00:57:12.400
You knew it was me.

592
00:57:13.842 --> 00:57:14.759
You didn't say anything.

593
00:57:15.613 --> 00:57:16.377
Come on, Draco!

594
00:57:17.539 --> 00:57:18.321
Don't be a prat.

595
00:57:19.027 --> 00:57:19.737
Do it!

596
00:57:21.332 --> 00:57:21.862
Easy!

597
00:57:23.877 --> 00:57:24.608
<i>Expelliarmus</i>

598
00:57:25.519 --> 00:57:26.454
<i>Avada Kedavra</i>

599
00:57:26.719 --> 00:57:27.173
<i>Stupefy</i>

600
00:57:31.559 --> 00:57:33.717
This is my girlfriend,
you bloody gits!

601
00:57:54.749 --> 00:57:55.188
Got it!

602
00:58:10.738 --> 00:58:12.080
They've set the bloody place on fire!

603
00:59:17.883 --> 00:59:18.677
Come on!
This way!

604
00:59:27.224 --> 00:59:28.126
We can't leave them!

605
00:59:29.096 --> 00:59:30.095
He's joking, right?

606
00:59:39.506 --> 00:59:42.111
If we die for them,
Harry, I'm gonna kill you!

607
01:00:03.407 --> 01:00:03.978
Harry!

608
01:00:49.135 --> 01:00:49.793
My Lord?

609
01:00:50.652 --> 01:00:52.477
Avada Kedavra!

610
01:00:59.354 --> 01:01:02.819
Come Nagini, I need to keep you safe.

611
01:01:15.965 --> 01:01:16.916
It's the snake....

612
01:01:17.991 --> 01:01:19.240
....and she's the last one.

613
01:01:19.624 --> 01:01:20.684
It's the last Horcrux.

614
01:01:27.498 --> 01:01:28.597
Look inside him, Harry.

615
01:01:30.148 --> 01:01:33.029
Find out where he is,
if you find him, we can find the snake.

616
01:01:33.672 --> 01:01:34.597
And we can end this!

617
01:02:01.972 --> 01:02:02.913
My Lord...

618
01:02:04.372 --> 01:02:06.973
Might it be less...

619
01:02:08.502 --> 01:02:11.853
I should not be more prudent to call off
this attack.

620
01:02:13.053 --> 01:02:14.868
Simply seek the boy.

621
01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:15.776
Yourself.

622
01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:18.889
I do not need to seek the boy...

623
01:02:19.285 --> 01:02:23.578
....before the night is out, he will come to me!
Do you understand?

624
01:02:25.210 --> 01:02:25.759
Look at me!

625
01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.403
How can you live with yourself, Lucius?

626
01:02:31.249 --> 01:02:32.017
I don't know.

627
01:02:35.188 --> 01:02:36.372
Go and find Severus.

628
01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:39.164
Bring him to me.

629
01:02:47.767 --> 01:02:48.754
I know where he is.

630
01:02:59.108 --> 01:02:59.841
Come on!

631
01:03:46.334 --> 01:03:46.912
No!

632
01:04:32.715 --> 01:04:35.923
You have performed extra-ordinary magic
with this wand, My Lord,

633
01:04:35.927 --> 01:04:37.920
...in the last few hours alone.

634
01:04:37.958 --> 01:04:38.552
No!

635
01:04:40.129 --> 01:04:46.752
No! I am extra-ordinary.
But the wand resists me.

636
01:04:47.023 --> 01:04:52.209
There is no wand more powerful.
Ollivander himself has said it.

637
01:04:52.958 --> 01:04:57.980
Tonight, when the boy comes.
It will not fail you, I am sure of it...

638
01:05:00.362 --> 01:05:05.981
It answers to you,
and you only.

639
01:05:06.959 --> 01:05:07.729
Does it?

640
01:05:11.213 --> 01:05:11.875
My Lord?

641
01:05:14.891 --> 01:05:18.021
The wand, does it truly
answer to me?

642
01:05:20.652 --> 01:05:22.328
You're a clever man, Severus.

643
01:05:22.861 --> 01:05:24.053
Surely you must know...

644
01:05:26.827 --> 01:05:31.524
- Where does its true loyalty lie?
- With you...

645
01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:34.717
Of course, My Lord.

646
01:05:35.076 --> 01:05:41.726
The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly,
because I am not its true master.

647
01:05:43.449 --> 01:05:47.560
The Elder Wand belongs to the
wizard who killed its last owner.

648
01:05:54.358 --> 01:05:56.823
You killed Dumbledore, Severus.

649
01:05:58.698 --> 01:06:02.731
While you live, the Elder
Wand cannot truly be mine.

650
01:06:05.209 --> 01:06:08.224
You've been a good and faithful servant,
Severus.

651
01:06:09.530 --> 01:06:13.272
But only I can live forever.

652
01:06:17.596 --> 01:06:18.479
My Lord...

653
01:06:24.213 --> 01:06:26.192
Nagini, kill!

654
01:07:24.604 --> 01:07:31.576
Take it...
Take it up, please!

655
01:07:32.478 --> 01:07:34.954
Give me something!
Quickly, a flask. Anything!

656
01:07:53.336 --> 01:07:54.841
Take them to the Pensieve.

657
01:07:58.051 --> 01:07:59.179
Look at me...

658
01:08:05.243 --> 01:08:06.915
You really have your mother's eyes.

659
01:08:39.688 --> 01:08:45.755
<i>You've fought valiantly,
but in vain...</i>

660
01:08:50.059 --> 01:08:57.352
<i>I do not wish this. Every drop of magical blood
spilled is a terrible waste.</i>

661
01:08:57.924 --> 01:09:01.147
<i>I, therefore command my forces to retreat...</i>

662
01:09:02.254 --> 01:09:06.691
<i>In their absence,
dispose your dead with dignity,</i>

663
01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:13.547
<i>Harry Potter, I now speak directly to you.</i>

664
01:09:14.115 --> 01:09:21.292
<i>On this night, you have allowed your friends to die
for you, rather than face me yourself.</i>

665
01:09:21.786 --> 01:09:27.633
<i>There is no greater dishonor.
Join me in the Forbidden Forrest...</i>

666
01:09:28.028 --> 01:09:30.185
<i>...and confront your fate.</i>

667
01:09:31.053 --> 01:09:43.805
<i>If you do not do this, I shall kill every last man,
woman and child who tries to conceal you from me.</i>

668
01:10:03.453 --> 01:10:04.298
Where's everybody?

669
01:10:30.244 --> 01:10:30.928
Harry?

670
01:10:36.774 --> 01:10:40.885
Oh, come on!
Don't be sad on it, she's passed.

671
01:10:42.824 --> 01:10:44.052
There, she's gone.

672
01:12:49.004 --> 01:12:53.471
<i>Freak! Come here! I'm gonna tell mommy!
You're freak!</i>

673
01:12:53.949 --> 01:12:55.441
<i>You're freak, Lily!</i>

674
01:12:55.870 --> 01:12:56.648
<i>Come here!</i>

675
01:13:18.004 --> 01:13:21.077
<i>She's jealous.
She's ordinary and you're special.</i>

676
01:13:21.432 --> 01:13:22.353
<i>That's not true, Severus.</i>

677
01:13:45.391 --> 01:13:46.631
<i>Gryffindor!</i>

678
01:13:54.581 --> 01:13:56.357
<i>- Hi, I'm James.
- Hi, I'm Lily.</i>

679
01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:02.787
<i>Just like your father.</i>

680
01:14:05.681 --> 01:14:07.702
<i>Don't say a word against my father!</i>

681
01:14:16.297 --> 01:14:19.909
<i>Masters shall be reunited once more!</i>

682
01:14:20.412 --> 01:14:21.247
<i>Severus.</i>

683
01:14:23.331 --> 01:14:24.455
<i>No, don't kill me!</i>

684
01:14:25.357 --> 01:14:27.495
The prophecy did not refer to a woman.

685
01:14:29.237 --> 01:14:31.542
It spoke about a boy born at the end of the July.

686
01:14:31.546 --> 01:14:33.328
Yes, but he thinks it's her son!

687
01:14:34.279 --> 01:14:36.650
He intends to hunt them down and
to kill them.

688
01:14:37.476 --> 01:14:41.272
Hide him... hide them all.
I beg you!

689
01:14:41.807 --> 01:14:44.294
What would you give me in exchange, Severus?

690
01:14:46.676 --> 01:14:48.270
- Anything.
- Harry...

691
01:14:48.798 --> 01:14:50.440
<i>Harry, you were so loved.</i>

692
01:14:51.102 --> 01:14:55.194
<i>So loved!
Harry, mama loves you.</i>

693
01:14:56.134 --> 01:14:57.511
Dadda loves you.

694
01:14:59.716 --> 01:15:00.944
Harry, be safe.

695
01:15:02.001 --> 01:15:02.962
Be strong.

696
01:15:02.964 --> 01:15:04.325
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

697
01:15:09.732 --> 01:15:13.213
You said you would keep her safe.

698
01:15:13.217 --> 01:15:14.668
Lily and James...

699
01:15:14.936 --> 01:15:17.270
..put their faith in the wrong person,
Severus.

700
01:15:17.942 --> 01:15:18.833
Rather like you.

701
01:15:21.994 --> 01:15:23.272
The boy survives.

702
01:15:23.281 --> 01:15:25.377
He doesn't need protection,
the Dark Lord has gone.

703
01:15:25.576 --> 01:15:27.126
The Dark Lord will return.

704
01:15:28.092 --> 01:15:30.483
And when he does, the boy
will be in terrible danger!

705
01:15:32.673 --> 01:15:33.955
He has her eyes.

706
01:15:38.338 --> 01:15:40.663
If you truly loved her...

707
01:15:43.956 --> 01:15:47.842
No one, can know.

708
01:15:47.845 --> 01:15:50.102
<i>I shall never reveal the best of you,
Severus.</i>

709
01:15:50.351 --> 01:15:51.118
<i>Your word?</i>

710
01:15:51.494 --> 01:15:54.164
<i>Can you risk your life every day
to protect the boy?</i>

711
01:15:54.169 --> 01:15:59.854
<i>... He possesses no measurable talent, his arrogance rivals even that of his father
and he seems to relish in his fame... </i>

712
01:16:00.074 --> 01:16:01.952
<i>Don't say a word against my father!</i>

713
01:16:03.008 --> 01:16:06.753
<i>James Potter, lazy, arrogant.</i>

714
01:16:06.755 --> 01:16:09.992
<i>- My father was a great man!
- Your father was a swine!</i>

715
01:16:11.957 --> 01:16:16.924
Drink it, it will contain the curse to
your hand, for the time being.

716
01:16:17.306 --> 01:16:20.054
- It will spread, Albus.
- How long?

717
01:16:22.184 --> 01:16:23.307
Maybe a year.

718
01:16:26.448 --> 01:16:27.485
Don't ignore me, Severus.

719
01:16:29.271 --> 01:16:32.944
We both know Lord Voldemort has ordered
the Malfoy boy to murder me.

720
01:16:35.215 --> 01:16:40.943
But should he fail, I should presume
the Dark Lord will turn to you.

721
01:16:44.078 --> 01:16:46.785
You must be the one to kill me, Severus.

722
01:16:48.083 --> 01:16:49.612
It is the only way.

723
01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:55.108
Only then, will the Dark Lord trust you completely.

724
01:17:01.181 --> 01:17:04.888
It will come a time, when Harry Potter,
must be told something.

725
01:17:07.413 --> 01:17:12.205
But you must wait, until Voldemort is at his
most vulnerable.

726
01:17:12.791 --> 01:17:14.304
Must be told what?

727
01:17:15.801 --> 01:17:19.563
On the night, Lord Voldemort went
to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry...

728
01:17:21.788 --> 01:17:23.998
And Lily Potter cast herself between them...

729
01:17:24.986 --> 01:17:26.772
...the curse rebounded.

730
01:17:28.779 --> 01:17:31.735
When that happens, a part of Voldemort's soul...

731
01:17:32.092 --> 01:17:36.169
...latched itself onto the only living thing
it could find...

732
01:17:37.086 --> 01:17:38.364
...Harry himself.

733
01:17:40.687 --> 01:17:42.985
There's a reason Harry can speak with snakes...

734
01:17:44.355 --> 01:17:47.172
There's a reason he can look into
Lord Voldemort's mind...

735
01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:55.154
A part of Voldemort lives inside him.

736
01:18:01.318 --> 01:18:03.188
So, when the time comes...

737
01:18:05.078 --> 01:18:06.737
...the boy must die?

738
01:18:08.967 --> 01:18:12.366
Yes... yes.
He must die.

739
01:18:30.573 --> 01:18:34.241
You've kept him alive, so he can
die at the proper moment?

740
01:18:38.831 --> 01:18:41.322
You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter.

741
01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:45.432
Don't tell me now, that you've
grown to care for the boy.

742
01:18:50.835 --> 01:18:53.152
<i>Expecto Patronum</i>

743
01:19:04.605 --> 01:19:05.488
Lily!

744
01:19:09.109 --> 01:19:10.343
After all this time?

745
01:19:14.774 --> 01:19:15.871
Always.

746
01:19:21.755 --> 01:19:23.534
So, when the time comes...

747
01:19:24.924 --> 01:19:26.654
...the boy must die?

748
01:19:27.671 --> 01:19:28.556
Yes.

749
01:19:29.678 --> 01:19:33.298
He must die.
And Voldemort himself must do it.

750
01:19:34.527 --> 01:19:35.786
That is essential.

751
01:20:39.153 --> 01:20:41.392
- Where've you been?
- I thought you went to the forest.

752
01:20:41.477 --> 01:20:42.581
I'm going there now.

753
01:20:43.379 --> 01:20:45.192
Are you mad?
No...

754
01:20:46.932 --> 01:20:48.287
You can't give yourself up to him.

755
01:20:52.453 --> 01:20:53.506
What is it, Harry?

756
01:20:55.766 --> 01:20:56.817
What is it you know?

757
01:21:00.375 --> 01:21:02.004
There's a reason I can hear them.

758
01:21:03.448 --> 01:21:04.497
The Horcruxes.

759
01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:08.530
I think I've known for a while.

760
01:21:10.687 --> 01:21:12.062
And I think you have, too.

761
01:21:15.788 --> 01:21:18.140
- I'll go with you.
- No, kill the snake.

762
01:21:19.408 --> 01:21:21.208
Kill the snake, and then it's just him!

763
01:22:38.458 --> 01:22:39.748
I'm ready to die.

764
01:23:20.143 --> 01:23:21.651
Resurrection Stone.

765
01:23:50.958 --> 01:23:53.466
You've been so brave, sweetheart.

766
01:23:58.122 --> 01:24:01.647
Why are you here?
All of you.

767
01:24:04.604 --> 01:24:05.987
We never left.

768
01:24:15.234 --> 01:24:16.160
Does...

769
01:24:17.539 --> 01:24:18.632
Does it hurt?

770
01:24:19.728 --> 01:24:20.798
Dying?

771
01:24:22.225 --> 01:24:24.162
Quicker than falling asleep.

772
01:24:28.274 --> 01:24:29.555
You're nearly there, son.

773
01:24:30.951 --> 01:24:32.059
I'm sorry.

774
01:24:32.328 --> 01:24:34.579
I never wanted any of you to die for me.

775
01:24:36.984 --> 01:24:38.280
And, Remus, your son?

776
01:24:38.655 --> 01:24:41.493
Others will tell him what his
mother and father died for.

777
01:24:42.919 --> 01:24:45.350
One day, he'll understand.

778
01:24:57.659 --> 01:24:58.630
You'll stay with me?

779
01:25:00.348 --> 01:25:01.783
Until the end.

780
01:25:03.382 --> 01:25:04.760
And he won't be able to see you?

781
01:25:05.437 --> 01:25:06.247
No.

782
01:25:08.313 --> 01:25:09.810
We're here, you see.

783
01:25:24.474 --> 01:25:25.964
Stay close to me.

784
01:25:28.484 --> 01:25:29.755
Always.

785
01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:46.902
No sign of him, My Lord.

786
01:26:02.833 --> 01:26:04.415
I thought he would come.

787
01:26:44.585 --> 01:26:46.523
Harry, no!

788
01:26:46.746 --> 01:26:49.104
- What're yeh doin' here?
- Quiet!

789
01:27:00.094 --> 01:27:01.340
Harry Potter...

790
01:27:05.183 --> 01:27:06.864
...The Boy Who Lived...

791
01:27:11.905 --> 01:27:13.390
...come to die.

792
01:27:31.658 --> 01:27:34.106
<i>Avada Kedavra</i>

793
01:28:27.371 --> 01:28:28.544
You can't help...

794
01:28:30.167 --> 01:28:33.034
Harry, you wonderful boy...

795
01:28:34.162 --> 01:28:36.810
You brave, brave man!

796
01:28:39.856 --> 01:28:40.972
Let us walk.

797
01:28:48.893 --> 01:28:50.219
Professor, what is that?

798
01:28:53.694 --> 01:28:55.836
Something beyond either of our help.

799
01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:01.681
A part of Voldemort sent here to die.

800
01:29:02.826 --> 01:29:04.092
And exactly where are we?

801
01:29:05.121 --> 01:29:06.725
I was going to ask you that.

802
01:29:07.330 --> 01:29:08.655
Where would you say that we are?

803
01:29:09.298 --> 01:29:12.516
Well, it looks like King's Cross station.

804
01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:15.310
Only cleaner...

805
01:29:16.164 --> 01:29:17.363
....and without all the trains.

806
01:29:18.767 --> 01:29:20.614
King's Cross, is that right?

807
01:29:21.736 --> 01:29:24.564
This is, as they say, 'your' party.

808
01:29:26.305 --> 01:29:28.713
I expect you now realize that
you and Voldemort...

809
01:29:29.589 --> 01:29:31.688
...have been connected by something other than fate.

810
01:29:32.173 --> 01:29:34.966
Since that night in Godric's Hollow,
all those years ago.

811
01:29:35.312 --> 01:29:36.681
So it's true then, sir.

812
01:29:37.223 --> 01:29:39.213
A part of him lives within me, doesn't it?

813
01:29:40.277 --> 01:29:41.175
Did.

814
01:29:41.368 --> 01:29:45.357
It's been just destroyed many moments
ago by none other than Voldemort himself.

815
01:29:47.152 --> 01:29:50.801
You, were the Horcrux he
never meant to make, Harry.

816
01:30:03.861 --> 01:30:07.108
- I have to go back, haven't I?
- Oh, that's up to you.

817
01:30:07.299 --> 01:30:10.048
- I've a choice?
- Oh, yes!

818
01:30:11.092 --> 01:30:12.791
We're in King's Cross, you say.

819
01:30:14.875 --> 01:30:19.328
I think if you so decide,
you'll be able to board a train.

820
01:30:20.791 --> 01:30:22.577
And where would it take me?

821
01:30:23.523 --> 01:30:24.466
On.

822
01:30:42.454 --> 01:30:43.996
Voldemort has the Elder Wand.

823
01:30:47.217 --> 01:30:48.110
True.

824
01:30:48.114 --> 01:30:49.443
And the snake's still alive?

825
01:30:49.743 --> 01:30:50.227
Yes.

826
01:30:51.366 --> 01:30:52.803
And I've nothing to kill it with?

827
01:30:54.189 --> 01:30:56.288
Help will always be given at Hogwarts, Harry.

828
01:30:56.609 --> 01:30:57.866
To those who ask for it.

829
01:30:59.759 --> 01:31:03.145
I've always pride of myself
on my ability to turn a phrase.

830
01:31:04.291 --> 01:31:06.522
Words are, in my not so humble opinion...

831
01:31:07.450 --> 01:31:10.216
..are most inexhaustible source of magic.

832
01:31:11.224 --> 01:31:14.604
Capable of inflicting injury and remedies.

833
01:31:15.769 --> 01:31:17.254
But I would in this case...

834
01:31:18.090 --> 01:31:20.727
...amend my original statement to this:

835
01:31:24.169 --> 01:31:26.972
Help, will always be given at Hogwarts,

836
01:31:27.722 --> 01:31:29.250
To those who deserve it.

837
01:31:35.702 --> 01:31:37.368
Do not pity the dead, Harry...

838
01:31:38.765 --> 01:31:39.901
Pity the living.

839
01:31:41.262 --> 01:31:42.476
And above all...

840
01:31:42.668 --> 01:31:44.967
....all those who live without love.

841
01:31:46.879 --> 01:31:48.703
Professor, my mother's Patronus...

842
01:31:49.424 --> 01:31:51.716
...was a doe, wasn't it?

843
01:31:53.073 --> 01:31:54.879
As the same as Professor Snape's.

844
01:31:56.328 --> 01:31:58.604
It's curious, don't you think?

845
01:31:58.610 --> 01:32:00.224
Actually, if I think about it...

846
01:32:00.755 --> 01:32:02.370
...it doesn't seem curious at all!

847
01:32:04.999 --> 01:32:06.239
I'll be going now, Harry.

848
01:32:07.487 --> 01:32:08.495
Professor?

849
01:32:13.239 --> 01:32:14.487
Is this all real?

850
01:32:15.906 --> 01:32:17.733
Or is it just happening inside my head?

851
01:32:17.742 --> 01:32:20.205
Of course it's happening
inside your head, Harry.

852
01:32:21.401 --> 01:32:24.147
Why should that mean, that it's not real?

853
01:32:30.331 --> 01:32:31.510
Professor?

854
01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:33.087
What should I do?

855
01:32:37.438 --> 01:32:38.479
Professor!

856
01:32:42.287 --> 01:32:44.399
My Lord, My Lord...

857
01:32:44.448 --> 01:32:45.394
Are you hurt?

858
01:32:45.888 --> 01:32:47.554
I don't need your help.

859
01:32:58.694 --> 01:32:59.140
The boy...

860
01:33:00.532 --> 01:33:01.504
Is he dead?

861
01:33:15.983 --> 01:33:16.944
Is he alive?

862
01:33:18.163 --> 01:33:19.521
Draco, is he alive?

863
01:33:45.905 --> 01:33:46.559
Dead.

864
01:35:10.889 --> 01:35:11.475
Who is that?

865
01:35:12.224 --> 01:35:13.155
Hagrid's carrying?

866
01:35:14.173 --> 01:35:15.154
Neville, who is it?

867
01:35:16.593 --> 01:35:18.047
Harry Potter...

868
01:35:19.983 --> 01:35:21.975
... is dead!
- No!

869
01:35:22.196 --> 01:35:23.085
No!

870
01:35:22.893 --> 01:35:23.702
Silence!

871
01:35:28.068 --> 01:35:29.654
Stupid girl!

872
01:35:31.218 --> 01:35:32.378
Harry Potter...

873
01:35:32.956 --> 01:35:33.840
...is dead!

874
01:35:34.704 --> 01:35:36.144
From this day forth...

875
01:35:37.489 --> 01:35:40.878
...you'll put your faith in me.

876
01:35:50.933 --> 01:35:52.693
Harry Potter is dead!

877
01:35:57.846 --> 01:36:00.034
And now it's the time to declare yourself.

878
01:36:02.648 --> 01:36:04.199
Come forward and join us...

879
01:36:06.796 --> 01:36:08.088
...or die!

880
01:36:14.267 --> 01:36:14.668
Draco!

881
01:36:20.509 --> 01:36:21.255
Draco.

882
01:36:25.118 --> 01:36:25.958
Draco.

883
01:36:29.584 --> 01:36:30.261
Come.

884
01:36:43.085 --> 01:36:45.096
Well done, Draco.

885
01:36:45.956 --> 01:36:46.964
Well done!

886
01:37:09.339 --> 01:37:11.663
Well, I must say I'd hoped for better.

887
01:37:16.301 --> 01:37:18.198
And who might you be, young man?

888
01:37:20.353 --> 01:37:21.410
Neville Longbottom.

889
01:37:27.248 --> 01:37:30.806
Well, Neville, I'm sure we can
find a place for you in our rank.

890
01:37:30.839 --> 01:37:32.242
I'd like to say something.

891
01:37:39.059 --> 01:37:43.378
Well, Neville, I'm sure we'd all be
fascinated to hear what you have to say.

892
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:49.563
- Doesn't matter that Harry is gone.
- Stand down, Neville!

893
01:37:49.766 --> 01:37:51.121
People die everyday!

894
01:37:53.924 --> 01:37:57.099
Friends, family.

895
01:37:59.878 --> 01:38:00.533
Yeah...

896
01:38:02.778 --> 01:38:03.992
We lost Harry tonight.

897
01:38:06.427 --> 01:38:07.339
He's still with us.

898
01:38:08.828 --> 01:38:09.588
In here.

899
01:38:11.613 --> 01:38:15.206
So as Fred, Remus...

900
01:38:17.096 --> 01:38:17.873
Tonks...

901
01:38:19.775 --> 01:38:20.476
All of them.

902
01:38:22.704 --> 01:38:24.500
They didn't die in vain.

903
01:38:29.762 --> 01:38:30.697
But you will.

904
01:38:31.298 --> 01:38:32.212
Because you're wrong!

905
01:38:33.411 --> 01:38:34.651
Harry's heart did beat for us.

906
01:38:35.427 --> 01:38:36.256
For all of us!

907
01:38:36.695 --> 01:38:37.725
It's not over!

908
01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:42.872
<i>Confringo</i>

909
01:38:54.633 --> 01:38:55.382
Come on!

910
01:39:04.091 --> 01:39:05.321
All remain into the castle.

911
01:39:05.551 --> 01:39:06.639
We have to kill the snake.

912
01:39:07.692 --> 01:39:08.252
Neville!

913
01:41:55.596 --> 01:41:57.700
Not my daughter, you bitch!

914
01:42:30.166 --> 01:42:31.146
Hey, you were right...

915
01:42:33.191 --> 01:42:35.218
...when you told Professor Snape
that wand was failing you.

916
01:42:35.303 --> 01:42:36.043
It will always fail...

917
01:42:38.338 --> 01:42:39.778
I killed Snape!

918
01:42:40.105 --> 01:42:41.622
But what if the wand never belonged
to Snape?

919
01:42:42.189 --> 01:42:43.871
What if its allegiance is always
to someone else?

920
01:42:45.194 --> 01:42:46.068
Oh, come on, Tom...

921
01:42:46.251 --> 01:42:47.609
Let's finish this the way we started.

922
01:42:49.083 --> 01:42:49.731
Together!

923
01:43:46.844 --> 01:43:47.852
Die!

924
01:46:26.806 --> 01:46:27.371
Harry!

925
01:47:25.978 --> 01:47:27.046
Why didn't it work for him?

926
01:47:27.659 --> 01:47:28.561
The Elder Wand?

927
01:47:30.491 --> 01:47:31.926
It answered to somebody else.

928
01:47:33.228 --> 01:47:35.686
When he killed Snape, he thought
the wand would become his.

929
01:47:35.879 --> 01:47:36.445
But the thing is...

930
01:47:37.982 --> 01:47:40.209
The wand never belonged to Snape.

931
01:47:40.286 --> 01:47:43.469
It was Draco, who disarmed Dumbledore
that night in the Astronomy tower.

932
01:47:44.703 --> 01:47:47.579
From that moment on and the wand
answered him,

933
01:47:49.409 --> 01:47:53.370
Until, the other night when I disarmed Draco.

934
01:47:54.066 --> 01:47:55.046
At Malfoy Manor.

935
01:47:55.881 --> 01:47:56.817
So, that means...

936
01:47:59.252 --> 01:48:00.001
It's mine!

937
01:48:03.064 --> 01:48:05.364
- What should we do with it?
- We?

938
01:48:06.770 --> 01:48:08.043
Just saying, that's the Elder Wand.

939
01:48:08.806 --> 01:48:10.454
The most powerful wand in the world.

940
01:48:11.351 --> 01:48:13.742
With that, he'd be invincible.

941
01:50:31.887 --> 01:50:32.550
Together.

942
01:51:10.672 --> 01:51:11.774
- Bag?
- Yeah.

943
01:51:12.583 --> 01:51:13.275
Jumper?

944
01:51:15.195 --> 01:51:15.954
I'm gonna miss you.

945
01:51:17.884 --> 01:51:18.307
Here they come.

946
01:51:34.209 --> 01:51:34.881
Dad?

947
01:51:35.774 --> 01:51:37.458
What if I am put in Slytherin?

948
01:51:40.460 --> 01:51:46.663
Albus Severus Potter.
You were named after two Headmasters of Hogwarts.

949
01:51:47.749 --> 01:51:52.329
One of them was a Slytherin.
And he was the bravest man I've ever known.

950
01:51:54.490 --> 01:51:57.169
- But just say if I am...
- Then Slytherin house...

951
01:51:57.630 --> 01:52:00.386
...will have gained a wonderful young wizard.

952
01:52:01.672 --> 01:52:02.719
But listen...

953
01:52:03.190 --> 01:52:06.253
If it really means that much to you,
you can choose Gryffindor.

954
01:52:07.050 --> 01:52:09.324
The Sorting Hat takes
your choice into account.

955
01:52:10.411 --> 01:52:12.423
- Really?
- Really.

956
01:52:16.374 --> 01:52:18.088
-  Ready?
-  Ready.
