1
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.280
It's beautiful here.

2
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.990
It was our aunt's.

3
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.360
We used to come here as kids.

4
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.580
The Order uses it now as a safe house.

5
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.000
What's left of us, at least.

6
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.380
Muggles think these keep evil away,
but they're wrong.

7
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.800
I need to talk to the goblin.

8
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.940
How are you?

9
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.440
Alive.

10
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.900
You probably don't remember...

11
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.240
That I showed you to your vault
the first time you came to Gringotts?

12
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.950
Even amongst goblins you're famous,
Harry Potter.

13
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.420
You buried the elf.

14
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.960
Yes.

15
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.840
And brought me here.

16
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.550
You are...

17
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.760
...a very unusual wizard.

18
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.560
How did you come by this sword?

19
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.440
It's complicated.

20
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.200
Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it
should be in her vault at Gringotts?

21
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.450
It's complicated.

22
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.340
The sword presented itself to us
in a moment of need.

23
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.250
We didn't steal it.

24
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.680
There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's
vault identical to this one...

25
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.470
...but it is a fake.

26
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.310
It was placed there this summer.

27
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.810
- And she never suspected it was a fake?
- The replica is very convincing.

28
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.850
Only a goblin would recognize
that this is the true sword of Gryffindor.

29
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.730
Who is the acquaintance?

30
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.360
A Hogwarts professor.
As I understand it, he's now headmaster.

31
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.200
Snape?

32
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.910
He put a fake sword in Bellatrix's vault?

33
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.660
Why?

34
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.410
There are more than a few curious things
in the vaults at Gringotts.

35
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.340
And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?

36
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.210
Perhaps.

37
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.010
I need to get into Gringotts.
Into one of the vaults.

38
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.850
This is impossible.

39
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.930
Alone, yes. But with you, no.

40
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.520
Why should I help you?

41
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.440
I have gold. Lots of it.

42
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.660
- I have no interest in gold.
- Then what?

43
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.370
That.

44
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.040
That is my price.

45
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.760
Are you thinking
there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?

46
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.430
She was terrified when she
thought we'd been in there.

47
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.480
She kept asking you
what else we'd taken.

48
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.560
I bet you there's a Horcrux in there,
another piece of his soul.

49
00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.690
Let's find it and kill it,
we're one step closer to killing him.

50
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.650
And what happens when we find it?

51
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.240
How are we supposed to destroy it
now you've given the sword to Griphook?

52
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.450
I'm still working on that part.

53
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.080
He's weak.

54
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.090
Yes?

55
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.930
Mr. Ollivander, I need to ask you
a few questions.

56
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.890
Anything, my boy, anything.

57
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.430
Would you mind identifying this wand?

58
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.230
We need to know if it's safe to use.

59
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.940
Walnut.

60
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.410
Dragon heartstring.

61
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.830
Twelve and three-quarter inches.

62
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.620
Unyie...

63
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.380
Unyielding.

64
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.710
This belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.

65
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.670
Treat it carefully.

66
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:09.680
And this?

67
00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.970
Hawthorn.

68
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.890
And unicorn hair.

69
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.730
Ten inches. Reasonably pliant.

70
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.820
This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.

71
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.040
Was? Is it not still?

72
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.330
Well, perhaps not, if you won it from him.

73
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:45.340
I sense its allegiance has changed.

74
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:54.930
You talk about wands
as if they have feelings...

75
00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:58.140
...can think.

76
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.980
The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.

77
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:11.490
That much has always been clear
to those of us who have studied wandlore.

78
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.030
And what do you know
about the Deathly Hallows?

79
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.210
It is rumored there are three:

80
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.050
The Elder Wand...

81
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:34.050
...the Cloak of invisibility
to hide you from your enemies...

82
00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:40.060
...and the Resurrection Stone
to bring back loved ones from the dead.

83
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:45.230
Together, they make one
the master of death.

84
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:51.490
But few truly believe
that such objects exist.

85
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:53.320
Do you?

86
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:56.070
Do you believe they exist, sir?

87
00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:06.210
I see no reason to put stock
into an old wives' tale.

88
00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:07.880
You're lying.

89
00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:11.340
You know one exists.

90
00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.340
You told him about it.

91
00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:19.060
You told him about the Elder Wand
and where he could go looking for it.

92
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.650
He tortured me.

93
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.150
Besides...

94
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.860
...I only conveyed rumors.

95
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.160
There's...

96
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:40.540
There's no telling whether he will find it.

97
00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.460
He has found it, sir.

98
00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.130
We'll let you rest.

99
00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.050
He's after you, Mr. Potter.

100
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:04.480
If it's true, what you say,
and he has the Elder Wand...

101
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:07.980
...I'm afraid...

102
00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:11.480
...you really don't stand a chance.

103
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:16.280
Well, I suppose I'll have to kill him
before he finds me, then.

104
00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.700
Are you sure that's hers?

105
00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.000
Positive.

106
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:34.670
Well?

107
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.590
How do I look?

108
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:39.680
Hideous.

109
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:43.600
You can give that to Hermione to hold,
all right, Griphook?

110
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:04.620
We're relying on you.

111
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:08.830
If you get us past the guards
and into the vault, the sword's yours.

112
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:22.550
Madam Lestrange.

113
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.510
Good morning.

114
00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:29.390
"Good morning"? "Good morning"?

115
00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.690
You're Bellatrix Lestrange,
not some dewy-eyed school girl.

116
00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.570
Hey. Easy.

117
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:39.280
She gives us away, we might as well
use that sword to slit our own throats.

118
00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:41.320
Understand?

119
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.990
No, he's right. I was being stupid.

120
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.750
Okay.

121
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.660
Let's do it.

122
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:56.190
I wish to enter my vault.

123
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.650
Identification?

124
00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.330
I hardly think that'll be necessary.

125
00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:11.660
Madam Lestrange.

126
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.670
I don't like to be kept waiting.

127
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.260
They know.

128
00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.590
They know she's an imposter.

129
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.220
They've been warned.

130
00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:37.860
Harry?

131
00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.570
What do we do, Harry?

132
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:49.990
Madam Lestrange,
would you mind presenting your wand?

133
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.160
And why should I do that?

134
00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:57.880
It's the bank's policy. I'm sure you
understand given the current climate.

135
00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.210
No. I most certainly do not understand.

136
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:05.220
I'm afraid I must insist.

137
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:12.390
Imperio.

138
00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:22.070
Very well, Madam Lestrange.
If you will follow me.

139
00:14:58.270 --> 00:14:59.400
What is that, Griphook?

140
00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.190
Griphook.

141
00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:27.670
Arresto momentum.

142
00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:32.680
Well done, Hermione.

143
00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.860
Oh, no, you look like you again.

144
00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:47.320
The Thief's Downfall.
Washes away all enchantments.

145
00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:48.610
Can be deadly.

146
00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.410
You don't say.

147
00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:53.580
Just out of interest,
is there any other way out of here?

148
00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.410
No.

149
00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:00.290
What the devil are all you
doing down here?

150
00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.670
Thieves!

151
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.130
- When you gave up the keys, you...
- Imperio.

152
00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.390
That doesn't sound good.

153
00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.150
Bloody hell.

154
00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.650
That's a Ukrainian Ironbelly.

155
00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.360
Here.

156
00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.340
It's been trained to expect pain
when it hears the noise.

157
00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.050
That's barbaric.

158
00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.660
Lumos.

159
00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:25.330
Blimey.

160
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:34.590
Accio Horcrux.

161
00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.140
You're not trying that one again,
are you?

162
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:41.100
That kind of magic won't work in here.

163
00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:47.310
Is it in here, Harry?

164
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:49.610
Can you feel anything?

165
00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.920
That's it. Up there.

166
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.720
They've added the Gemino curse.
Everything you touch will multiply.

167
00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:22.350
Give me the sword.

168
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:42.040
Stop moving.

169
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:05.890
Got it.

170
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.150
We had a deal, Griphook.

171
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:11.690
The cup for the sword.

172
00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:22.370
I said I'd get you in. I didn't say
anything about getting you out.

173
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:45.060
Griphook!

174
00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.890
- Thieves! Help!
- Griphook!

175
00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.890
Thieves!

176
00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.520
Foul little git.
Least we've still got Bogrod.

177
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:02.410
That's unfortunate.

178
00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:09.580
- We can't just stand here.
- Who's got an idea?

179
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.290
You're the brilliant one.

180
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.750
I've got something, but it's mad.

181
00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.250
Reducto.

182
00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:29.270
Well, come on, then.

183
00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.980
Relashio.

184
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:22.570
He's moving! Aah!

185
00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:50.350
Now what?

186
00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.850
Reducto.

187
00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:54.480
Hold on.

188
00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:07.910
That was brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

189
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:35.890
We're dropping.

190
00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.230
- I say we jump.
- When?

191
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.780
Now.

192
00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:41.170
He knows. You-Know-Who.

193
00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:42.960
He knows we broke into Gringotts.

194
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:46.300
He knows what we took
and he knows we're hunting Horcruxes.

195
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:48.300
- How is it you know?
- I saw him.

196
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:50.930
You let him in? Harry, you can't do that.

197
00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:54.640
Hermione, I can't always help it.
Well, maybe I can. I don't know.

198
00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:56.520
Never mind. What happened?

199
00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.480
Well, he's angry.

200
00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.230
And scared too.

201
00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.900
He knows if we find and destroy all
the Horcruxes we'll be able to kill him.

202
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:07.740
I reckon he'll stop at nothing
to make sure we don't find the rest.

203
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:11.200
There's more. One of them's at Hogwarts.

204
00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:13.070
What?

205
00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.910
- You saw it?
- I saw the castle and Rowena Ravenclaw.

206
00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.660
It must have to do with her.
We have to go there now.

207
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:22.130
We can't do that. We've got to plan.
We've got to figure it out.

208
00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:25.420
Hermione, when have any of our plans
ever actually worked?

209
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:28.010
We plan, we get there,
all hell breaks loose.

210
00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:30.380
He's right.

211
00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:34.800
- Snape's headmaster now.
- We can't just walk through the front door.

212
00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:39.730
Um, well, we'll go to Hogsmeade,
to Honeydukes.

213
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:42.230
Take the secret passage in the cellar.

214
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.770
It's... There's something wrong with him.

215
00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:50.280
It's like, you know, in the past, I've
always been able to follow his thoughts.

216
00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:53.320
And now everything
just feels disconnected.

217
00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:54.780
Maybe it's the Horcruxes.

218
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:56.950
Maybe he's growing weaker.
Maybe he's dying.

219
00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.250
No. No, it's more like he's wounded.

220
00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:03.210
If anything, he feels more dangerous.

221
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:54.590
- They're here!
- Search everywhere!

222
00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.010
- Look down by the stables!
- You two, come with me!

223
00:25:58.100 --> 00:25:59.600
Any sign?

224
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:16.160
Potter!

225
00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:30.880
In here, Potter.

226
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:46.350
Did you get a look at him?

227
00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:49.310
- For a second, I thought it was...
- I know. Dumbledore.

228
00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:07.290
Harry?

229
00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:11.500
I can see you in this.

230
00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:27.230
You bloody fools.
What were you thinking coming here?

231
00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:29.690
Have you any idea how dangerous it is?

232
00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:33.520
You're Aberforth, Dumbledore's brother.

233
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:35.860
It's you who I've been seeing in here.

234
00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:38.320
You're the one who sent Dobby.

235
00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:39.780
Where have you left him?

236
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.530
He's dead.

237
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.120
Sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.

238
00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:47.200
Who gave that to you? The mirror?

239
00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:50.040
Mundungus Fletcher, about a year ago.

240
00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:53.460
- Dung had no right. It belonged to...
Sirius.

241
00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.840
Albus told me.

242
00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:00.640
He also told me you'd likely be hacked off
if you ever found out I had it...

243
00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:05.720
...but ask yourself,
where would you be if I didn't?

244
00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:11.400
Do you hear from the others much?
From the Order?

245
00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:13.520
The Order's finished.

246
00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:15.070
You-Know-Who's won.

247
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:18.610
Anyone who says otherwise
is kidding themselves.

248
00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.320
We need to get into Hogwarts, tonight.

249
00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:23.450
Dumbledore gave us a job to do.

250
00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:25.280
Did he now?

251
00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:26.910
Nice job? Easy?

252
00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.000
We've been hunting Horcruxes.

253
00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:34.590
We think the last one's inside the castle,
but we'll need help getting in.

254
00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:38.460
That's not a job my brother's given you.
It's a suicide mission.

255
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:42.010
Do yourself a favor, boy, go home.
Live a little longer.

256
00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:46.850
- Dumbledore trusted me to see this through.
- What makes you think you can trust him?

257
00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:49.810
You think you can believe
anything my brother told you?

258
00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:53.770
In all the time you knew him,
did he ever mention my name?

259
00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:56.860
Did he ever mention hers?

260
00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:00.740
- Why should he...?
- Keep secrets? You tell me.

261
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:05.240
- I trusted him.
- That's a boy's answer.

262
00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:08.490
A boy who goes chasing Horcruxes
on the word of a man...

263
00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:11.410
...who wouldn't even tell him
where to start. You're lying!

264
00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.880
Not just to me, that doesn't matter.
To yourself as well.

265
00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.090
That's what a fool does.

266
00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:22.130
You don't strike me as a fool,
Harry Potter.

267
00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:26.970
So I'll ask you again.
There must be a reason.

268
00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:32.310
I'm not interested in what happened
between you and your brother.

269
00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.310
I don't care that you've given up.

270
00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:40.360
I trusted the man I knew.

271
00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:46.570
And we need to get into
the castle tonight.

272
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:54.250
You know what to do.

273
00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.800
Where have you sent her?

274
00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:06.840
You'll see soon enough.

275
00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.810
That's your sister, Ariana, isn't it?

276
00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:19.520
She died very young, didn't she?

277
00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:24.200
My brother sacrificed many things,
Mr. Potter...

278
00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.860
...on his journey to find power...

279
00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:29.280
...including Ariana.

280
00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:32.580
And she was devoted to him.

281
00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:35.620
He gave her everything...

282
00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.330
...but time.

283
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:42.090
Thank you, Mr. Dumbledore.

284
00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:51.470
He did save our lives twice.

285
00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.270
Kept an eye on us in that mirror.

286
00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:58.560
That doesn't seem
like someone who's given up.

287
00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:05.860
She's coming back.

288
00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:07.780
Who's that with her?

289
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.080
Neville.

290
00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:19.750
- Oh, you look...
- Like hell, I reckon.

291
00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.550
This is nothing. Seamus is worse.

292
00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:26.760
Hey, Ab, we've got a couple more
coming through.

293
00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:29.800
Don't remember this
on the Marauder's Map.

294
00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:31.890
That's because it never existed till now.

295
00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:35.310
The seven secret passages were sealed off
before the start of the year.

296
00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.270
This is the only way in or out now.

297
00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.060
The grounds are crawling with
Death Eaters and Dementors.

298
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:41.940
How bad is Snape as headmaster?

299
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:45.070
Hardly ever see him.
It's the Carrows you need to watch out for.

300
00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.280
Carrows?

301
00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.900
Yeah. Brother and sister.
In charge of discipline.

302
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:50.780
They like punishment, the Carrows.

303
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:52.950
They did that to you? Why?

304
00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:56.790
Today's Dark Arts lessons
had us practicing the Cruciatus Curse.

305
00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.870
On first-years.

306
00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.880
I refused.

307
00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:03.790
Hogwarts has changed.

308
00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:19.140
Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?

309
00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:27.190
Hey, listen up, you lot.
Brought you a surprise.

310
00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:31.490
Not more of Aberforth's cooking, I hope.
Be a surprise if we can digest it.

311
00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:35.410
Blimey.

312
00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:37.910
- Harry!
- Yeah!

313
00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:53.430
Get the word out to Remus and the others
that Harry's back.

314
00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.760
Okay, let's not kill him before
You-Know-Who...

315
00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:57.470
River, D.A. calling. Do you read?

316
00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.560
Lightning has struck.

317
00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:02.520
What's the plan, Harry?

318
00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.400
Okay.

319
00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.490
There's something we need to find.

320
00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:16.620
Something hidden here in the castle.
And it may help us defeat You-Know-Who.

321
00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:18.580
Right. What is it?

322
00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:19.910
We don't know.

323
00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:24.790
- Where is it?
- We don't know that either.

324
00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:29.380
- I realize it's not much to go on.
- That's nothing to go on.

325
00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:32.050
I think it has something to do
with Ravenclaw.

326
00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:36.890
Um, it'll be small, easily concealed.

327
00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:39.890
Anyone, any ideas?

328
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:43.730
Well, there's Rowena Ravenclaw's
lost diadem.

329
00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:47.440
- Oh, bloody hell. Here we go.
- Lost diadem of Ravenclaw?

330
00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:52.950
Hasn't anyone heard of it?
It's quite famous.

331
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:56.490
Yes, but, Luna, it's lost,
for centuries now.

332
00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.450
There isn't a person alive today
who's seen it.

333
00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:01.830
Excuse me. Can someone tell me
what a bloody diadem is?

334
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.750
It's a sort of crown.
You know, like a tiara.

335
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.250
Harry.

336
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:11.840
Hi there.

337
00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:18.100
Six months she hasn't seen me
and it's like I'm Frankie First-Year.

338
00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:20.010
- I'm her brother.
- Got lots of those.

339
00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:22.470
- There's only one Harry.
- Shut up, Seamus.

340
00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:24.140
What is it, Ginny?

341
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:28.520
Snape knows. He knows that Harry
was spotted in Hogsmeade.

342
00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:13.150
Many of you are surely wondering
why I have summoned you at this hour.

343
00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:19.360
It's come to my attention
that earlier this evening...

344
00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:23.080
...Harry Potter was sighted
in Hogsmeade.

345
00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:27.160
Now...

346
00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:28.960
...should anyone...

347
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:35.840
...student or staff,
attempt to aid Mr. Potter...

348
00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:39.130
...they will be punished...

349
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:43.760
...in a manner consistent with
the severity of their transgression.

350
00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:46.180
Furthermore...

351
00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:51.190
...any person found to have knowledge
of these events...

352
00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:56.490
...who fails to come forward...

353
00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:01.990
...will be treated as...

354
00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:05.870
...equally guilty.

355
00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.000
Now then...

356
00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:15.550
...if anyone here...

357
00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:22.220
...has any knowledge of Mr. Potter's
movements this evening...

358
00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:28.310
...I invite them to step forward...

359
00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:33.560
...now.

360
00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:52.080
It seems, despite your exhaustive
defensive strategies...

361
00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:54.920
...you still have a bit of a
security problem, headmaster.

362
00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:01.430
And I'm afraid it's quite extensive.

363
00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:04.260
How dare you stand where he stood?

364
00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:08.020
Tell them how it happened that night.

365
00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:12.730
Tell them how you looked him in the eye,
a man who trusted you, and killed him.

366
00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:14.770
Tell them.

367
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:40.630
Coward!

368
00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:52.180
Harry.

369
00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:54.480
Potter?

370
00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:34.690
I know that many of you will want to fight.

371
00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:39.900
Some of you may even think
that to fight is wise.

372
00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.360
But this is folly.

373
00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.700
Give me Harry Potter.

374
00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:51.830
Do this and none shall be harmed.

375
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:58.040
Give me Harry Potter
and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched.

376
00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:01.130
Give me Harry Potter...

377
00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:05.220
...and you will be rewarded.

378
00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:09.010
You have one hour.

379
00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:20.730
What are you waiting for?

380
00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:22.230
Someone grab him.

381
00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:33.080
Students out of bed.

382
00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:36.120
Students out of bed!

383
00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:37.870
Students in the corridor!

384
00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:41.420
They are supposed to be out of bed,
you blithering idiot.

385
00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.250
Oh.

386
00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.880
Sorry, ma'am.

387
00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:49.930
As it happens, Mr. Filch,
your arrival is most opportune.

388
00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:52.430
If you would, I would like you, please...

389
00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:57.100
...to lead Miss Parkinson and the rest
of Slytherin House from the hall.

390
00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:59.640
Exactly where is it
I'll be leading them to, ma'am?

391
00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:02.610
The dungeons would do.

392
00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:07.400
Right. Come on. Come on.

393
00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:10.860
I presume you have a reason for returning,
Potter. What is it you need?

394
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:13.620
Time, professor.
As much as you can get me.

395
00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:17.790
Do what you have to do.
I'll secure the castle.

396
00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:20.250
Potter.

397
00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:23.960
It's good to see you.

398
00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.210
It's good to see you too, professor.

399
00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.930
Hold the fort, Neville.

400
00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:35.350
Hurry up, come on!

401
00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:44.110
Harry. Hermione and I
have been thinking.

402
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:46.190
It doesn't matter if we find a Horcrux.

403
00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:48.490
- What do you mean?
- Unless we can destroy it.

404
00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:50.030
So we were thinking...

405
00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.700
Ron was thinking.
It was Ron's idea. It's brilliant.

406
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:55.990
You destroyed Tom Riddle's diary
with a basilisk fang, right?

407
00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:58.330
Me and Hermione
know where we might find one.

408
00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.330
Okay.

409
00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:04.250
Okay, but take this. That way you can
find me when you get back.

410
00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:06.500
- Where are you going?
- Ravenclaw common room.

411
00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:08.170
Gotta start somewhere.

412
00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.680
Harry. Harry!

413
00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:21.480
Let me get this straight.
You're giving us permission to do this?

414
00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.520
That is correct, Longbottom.

415
00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:25.110
To blow it up? Boom?

416
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:26.770
Boom!

417
00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:30.360
Wicked. But how on earth
are we gonna do that?

418
00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:32.860
Why don't you confer with Mr. Finnigan?

419
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:36.580
As I recall, he has a particular proclivity
for pyrotechnics.

420
00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:37.780
I can bring it down.

421
00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:40.330
That's the spirit. Now away you go.

422
00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:44.540
You do realize, of course, we can't
keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely.

423
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:47.880
Well, that doesn't mean
we can't delay him.

424
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:53.050
And his name is Voldemort, Filius.
You might as well use it.

425
00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:56.140
He's going to try to kill you either way.

426
00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:01.730
Piertotum Locomotor.

427
00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.080
Hogwarts is threatened.

428
00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:25.420
Man the boundaries. Protect us.
Do your duty to our school.

429
00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:32.170
I've always wanted to use that spell.

430
00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:45.020
Protege Maxima. Fianto Duri.
Repello Inimicum.

431
00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:54.610
Protege Maxima.

432
00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:28.140
- Harry, wait. I need to talk to you.
- I'm a bit preoccupied at the moment, Luna.

433
00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:30.980
You won't find anything
where you're going. You're wasting time.

434
00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:33.150
- Look, we'll talk later, okay, Luna?
- Harry.

435
00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:34.690
- Later.
- Harry Potter!

436
00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:36.820
You listen to me right now!

437
00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:41.370
Don't you remember what Cho said
about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem?

438
00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:44.790
"There's not a person alive
who's seen it."

439
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:49.670
It's obvious, isn't it?
We have to talk to someone who's dead.

440
00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:02.850
It's very impressive, isn't it?

441
00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:20.820
If you're to find her,
you'll find her down there.

442
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:22.410
- Aren't you coming?
- No.

443
00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:25.080
I think it's best if you two talk alone.

444
00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.450
She's very shy.

445
00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:55.520
You're the Grey Lady...

446
00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.070
...the Ghost of Ravenclaw Tower.

447
00:44:58.240 --> 00:44:59.940
I do not answer to that name.

448
00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:04.700
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's Helena, isn't it? Helena Ravenclaw.

449
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:06.990
Rowena's daughter.

450
00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:09.200
Are you a friend of Luna's?

451
00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:11.290
Yes.

452
00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:13.920
And she thought you might be able
to help me.

453
00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:18.420
You seek my mother's diadem.

454
00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.630
Yes.

455
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:23.590
That's right.

456
00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:30.020
Luna is kind,
unlike so many of the others.

457
00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:33.270
But she was wrong. I cannot help you.

458
00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:40.320
Wait. Please.

459
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:44.070
I want to destroy it.

460
00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:24.570
They never learn.

461
00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:27.740
Such a pity.

462
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:31.330
But, my Lord...

463
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:33.790
...shouldn't we wait for...?

464
00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:35.670
My Lord.

465
00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:42.340
Begin.

466
00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:05.280
That's what you want too,
isn't it, Helena?

467
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:12.120
You want it destroyed.

468
00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:15.330
Another swore to destroy it
many years ago...

469
00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:18.370
...a strange boy with a strange name.

470
00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:21.380
- Tom Riddle.
- But he lied.

471
00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:22.710
He's lied to many people.

472
00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:26.010
I know what he's done! I know who he is!

473
00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:29.050
He defiled it with dark magic!

474
00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:47.740
I can destroy it once and for all.

475
00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:52.700
But only if you tell me where he hid it.

476
00:47:54.660 --> 00:48:00.420
You do know where he hid it,
don't you, Helena?

477
00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:04.420
You just have to tell me.

478
00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:07.720
Please.

479
00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:21.770
Strange.

480
00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:27.740
You remind me of him a bit.

481
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:30.200
It's here...

482
00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:35.120
...in the castle, in the place where
everything is hidden.

483
00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:38.750
If you have to ask...

484
00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:41.210
...you will never know.

485
00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:45.130
If you know, you need only ask.

486
00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:49.010
Thank you.

487
00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:06.070
Tell Professor McGonagall Remus and I
will handle this side of the castle.

488
00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:08.650
Yes, sir.

489
00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:15.160
Hey, Dean, on second
thoughts, tell Professor McGonagall...

490
00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:18.160
...we might need one or two more wands
this side.

491
00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:23.670
It is the quality of one's
convictions that determines success...

492
00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:25.590
...not the number of followers.

493
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:27.750
Who said that?

494
00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:29.760
Me.

495
00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:36.430
You okay, Freddie?

496
00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:38.220
Yeah.

497
00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:41.390
Me too.

498
00:49:58.490 --> 00:50:02.120
Harry talks in his sleep.
Have you noticed?

499
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.040
No, of course not.

500
00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:54.260
Yeah?

501
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:55.930
You and whose army?

502
00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:17.780
- You do it.
- I can't.

503
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:20.030
Yes, you can.

504
00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:19.750
Neville!

505
00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:38.690
That went well.

506
00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:29.030
- Get inside!
- This way, everyone. Take cover!

507
00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:48.550
Stupefy!

508
00:55:49.890 --> 00:55:51.390
Get your coat on!

509
00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:54.680
Ginny. Neville. Are you all right?

510
00:55:54.850 --> 00:55:59.400
Never better. I feel like I could spit
fire. You haven't seen Luna, have you?

511
00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:01.400
- Luna?
- I'm mad for her!

512
00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:05.860
I think it's about time I told her
since we'll probably both be dead by dawn.

513
00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:11.570
I know.

514
00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:41.980
Bloody hell. We'll never find it on this.

515
00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:44.820
- There he is, just there.
- Brilliant.

516
00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:48.280
He just vanished. Just now. I saw it.

517
00:56:51.450 --> 00:56:53.410
Maybe he's gone to
the Room of Requirement.

518
00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:57.040
It doesn't show up on the map, does it?
You said that last year.

519
00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:59.540
That's right. I... I did.

520
00:56:59.710 --> 00:57:01.420
Let's go.

521
00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:03.830
Brilliant.

522
00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:11.130
Come on!

523
00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:04.370
Well, well.

524
00:59:05.330 --> 00:59:07.420
What brings you here, Potter?

525
00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:10.090
I could ask you the same.

526
00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:12.760
You have something of mine.

527
00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:15.170
I'd like it back.

528
00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:17.720
- What's wrong with the one you have?
It's my mother's.

529
00:59:17.890 --> 00:59:21.760
It's powerful, but it's not the same.

530
00:59:21.930 --> 00:59:25.560
Doesn't quite understand me.

531
00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:27.520
Know what I mean?

532
00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:30.060
Why didn't you tell her?

533
00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:32.940
Bellatrix.

534
00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:39.570
You knew it was me.
You didn't say anything.

535
00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:45.910
Come on, Draco.
Don't be a prat. Do him.

536
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:48.040
Easy.

537
00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:50.750
Expelliarmus.

538
00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:51.960
Avada Kedavra!

539
00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:53.130
Stupefy!

540
00:59:57.630 --> 01:00:00.640
That's my girlfriend, you numpties!

541
01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:23.870
Got it.

542
01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:32.000
Run!

543
01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:34.460
Run!

544
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:41.340
Goyle's setting the bloody place on fire!

545
01:01:48.370 --> 01:01:50.250
Come on! This way!

546
01:01:57.590 --> 01:01:59.590
We can't leave them.

547
01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:01.920
He's joking, right?

548
01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:13.440
If we die for them, Harry,
I'm gonna kill you.

549
01:02:36.130 --> 01:02:37.790
Harry!

550
01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:25.510
My Lord?

551
01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:28.220
Avada Kedavra!

552
01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:38.850
Come, Nagini. I need to keep you safe.

553
01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.040
It's the snake.

554
01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:56.830
She's the last one. It's the last Horcrux.

555
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:05.880
Look inside him, Harry.

556
01:04:06.050 --> 01:04:09.840
Find out where he is.
If we find him, we can find the snake.

557
01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:12.140
Then we can end this.

558
01:04:39.830 --> 01:04:41.580
My Lord?

559
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:45.590
Might it be less, uh...

560
01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:50.680
Might it not be more prudent
to call off this attack...

561
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:53.760
...and simply seek the boy yourself?

562
01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:57.270
I do not need to seek the boy.

563
01:04:57.430 --> 01:05:01.810
Before the night is out, he will
come to me. Do you understand?

564
01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:05.770
Look at me.

565
01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:09.900
How can you live with yourself, Lucius?

566
01:05:10.070 --> 01:05:11.820
I don't know.

567
01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:16.450
Go and find Severus.

568
01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.120
Bring him to me.

569
01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:29.170
I know where he is.

570
01:05:38.850 --> 01:05:40.980
Come on!

571
01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:23.140
Crucio!

572
01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:30.320
No!

573
01:07:16.450 --> 01:07:19.700
You have performed extraordinary
magic with this wand, my Lord...

574
01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:21.910
...in the last few hours alone.

575
01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:23.830
No.

576
01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:27.580
No, I am extraordinary...

577
01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:31.380
...but the wand resists me.

578
01:07:31.550 --> 01:07:34.590
There is no wand more powerful.

579
01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:37.590
Ollivander himself has said it.

580
01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:43.390
Tonight, when the boy comes,
it will not fail you. I am sure of it.

581
01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:48.270
It answers to you...

582
01:07:49.110 --> 01:07:51.440
...and you only.

583
01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:53.690
Does it?

584
01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:58.240
My Lord?

585
01:08:00.530 --> 01:08:04.870
The wand, does it truly answer to me?

586
01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:08.750
You're a clever man, Severus.

587
01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:10.790
Surely you must know.

588
01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:16.210
Where does its true loyalty lie?

589
01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:18.470
With you...

590
01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:21.090
...of course, my Lord.

591
01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:22.470
The Elder Wand...

592
01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:29.060
...cannot serve me properly
because I am not its true master.

593
01:08:30.150 --> 01:08:35.650
The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard
who killed its last owner.

594
01:08:41.570 --> 01:08:45.240
You killed Dumbledore, Severus.

595
01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:51.370
While you live,
the Elder Wand cannot truly be mine.

596
01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:56.590
You've been a good and faithful servant,
Severus...

597
01:08:57.090 --> 01:09:02.180
...but only I can live forever.

598
01:09:05.470 --> 01:09:06.520
My Lord...

599
01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:14.310
Nagini, kill.

600
01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:17.380
Take them.

601
01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:20.460
Take them.

602
01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:22.760
Please.

603
01:10:22.930 --> 01:10:26.640
Give me something. Quickly.
A flask, anything.

604
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:46.450
Take them to the Pensieve.

605
01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:51.950
Look at me.

606
01:10:57.710 --> 01:11:00.460
You have your mother's eyes.

607
01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:37.670
You have fought valiantly...

608
01:11:39.090 --> 01:11:41.840
...but in vain.

609
01:11:45.130 --> 01:11:47.380
I do not wish this.

610
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:53.100
Every drop of magical blood spilled
is a terrible waste.

611
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:58.020
I therefore command my forces to retreat.

612
01:11:58.190 --> 01:12:03.730
In their absence,
dispose of your dead with dignity.

613
01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:10.280
Harry Potter, I now speak directly to you.

614
01:12:10.450 --> 01:12:15.830
On this night, you have allowed
your friends to die for you...

615
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.500
...rather than face me yourself.

616
01:12:18.670 --> 01:12:22.210
There is no greater dishonor.

617
01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:27.380
Join me in the Forbidden Forest
and confront your fate.

618
01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:31.220
If you do not do this...

619
01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:38.060
...I shall kill every last man,
woman and child...

620
01:12:38.230 --> 01:12:42.810
...who tries to conceal you from me.

621
01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:04.290
Where is everybody?

622
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:30.110
Harry.

623
01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:38.580
- Oh, come on.
- What's the matter with you?

624
01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:40.370
Oh, she's passed.

625
01:13:42.170 --> 01:13:44.670
There, she's gone.

626
01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:54.420
Freak!

627
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:56.090
Come here.

628
01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:58.340
I'm gonna tell Mummy. You're a freak.

629
01:15:58.510 --> 01:16:00.930
You're a freak, Lily!

630
01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:02.720
Come here.

631
01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:27.000
She's jealous because
she's ordinary and you're special.

632
01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:29.710
That's mean, Severus.

633
01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:54.610
Gryffindor!

634
01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:05.080
- Hi. I'm James.
- Hi. I'm Lily.

635
01:17:09.670 --> 01:17:13.790
Just like your father. Lazy. Arrogant.

636
01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:15.800
Don't say a word against my father.

637
01:17:22.090 --> 01:17:23.680
Blood shall be spilt...

638
01:17:23.850 --> 01:17:28.850
...and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.

639
01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:30.940
Severus.

640
01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:34.020
No. Don't kill me.

641
01:17:34.190 --> 01:17:38.030
The prophecy did not refer to a woman.

642
01:17:38.190 --> 01:17:40.450
It spoke of a boy born at the end of July.

643
01:17:40.610 --> 01:17:42.860
Yes, but he thinks it's her son.

644
01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:46.620
He intends to hunt them down now,
to kill them.

645
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:51.290
Hide her. Hide them all. I beg you.

646
01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:54.540
What will you give me
in exchange, Severus?

647
01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:57.340
Anything.

648
01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:02.220
Harry. Harry, you are so loved. So loved.

649
01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:05.890
Harry, Mama loves you.

650
01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:07.930
Dada loves you.

651
01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:12.020
Harry, be safe.

652
01:18:12.190 --> 01:18:13.230
Be strong.

653
01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:14.900
Avada Kedavra!

654
01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:23.860
You said you would keep her safe.

655
01:18:24.030 --> 01:18:28.080
Lily and James put
their faith in the wrong person, Severus.

656
01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:31.080
Rather like you.

657
01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:34.710
The boy survives.

658
01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:37.130
He doesn't need protection.
The Dark Lord is gone.

659
01:18:37.290 --> 01:18:39.550
The Dark Lord will return.

660
01:18:39.710 --> 01:18:43.260
And when he does,
the boy will be in terrible danger.

661
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:46.800
He has her eyes.

662
01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:53.430
If you truly loved her...

663
01:18:56.150 --> 01:18:59.980
No one can know.

664
01:19:00.150 --> 01:19:02.650
That I should never reveal
the best of you, Severus?

665
01:19:02.820 --> 01:19:03.860
Your word.

666
01:19:04.030 --> 01:19:06.950
When you risk your life
every day to protect the boy?

667
01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:10.660
He possesses no measurable talent,
his arrogance rivals that of his father...

668
01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:12.700
...and he seems to relish his fame.

669
01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:15.750
Don't say a word against my father.

670
01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:18.130
James Potter?

671
01:19:18.290 --> 01:19:19.790
Lazy, arrogant.

672
01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:21.300
My father was a great man.

673
01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:23.340
Your father was a swine!

674
01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:26.840
Drink the rest.

675
01:19:27.010 --> 01:19:31.060
It will contain the curse to your hand
for the time being.

676
01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:33.140
It will spread, Albus.

677
01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:35.020
How long?

678
01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:38.480
Maybe a year.

679
01:19:40.650 --> 01:19:41.820
Don't ignore me, Severus.

680
01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:43.480
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

681
01:19:43.650 --> 01:19:47.660
We both know Lord Voldemort
has ordered the Malfoy boy to murder me.

682
01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:53.950
But should he fail,
one should presume the Dark Lord...

683
01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:56.250
...will turn to you.

684
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.920
You must be the one to kill me, Severus.

685
01:20:03.090 --> 01:20:05.260
It is the only way.

686
01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:10.600
Only then will the Dark Lord
trust you completely.

687
01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:13.430
Avada Kedavra.

688
01:20:16.690 --> 01:20:21.610
There will come a time
when Harry Potter must be told something.

689
01:20:23.190 --> 01:20:28.360
But you must wait until Voldemort
is at his most vulnerable.

690
01:20:28.530 --> 01:20:31.450
Must be told what?

691
01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:33.660
On the night Lord Voldemort...

692
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:37.040
...went to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry...

693
01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:40.750
...and Lily Potter cast herself
between them...

694
01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:43.460
...the curse rebounded.

695
01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:48.880
When that happened,
a part of Voldemort's soul...

696
01:20:49.050 --> 01:20:53.890
...latched itself onto the only
living thing it could find:

697
01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:56.220
Harry himself.

698
01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:00.980
There's a reason Harry can speak
with snakes.

699
01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:04.400
There's a reason he can look into
Lord Voldemort's mind.

700
01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:12.820
A part of Voldemort lives inside him.

701
01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:22.210
So when the time comes...

702
01:21:23.090 --> 01:21:25.250
...the boy must die?

703
01:21:27.170 --> 01:21:29.220
Yes. Yes.

704
01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:31.630
He must die.

705
01:21:49.950 --> 01:21:54.780
You've kept him alive
so that he can die at the proper moment.

706
01:21:58.450 --> 01:22:01.040
You've been raising him
like a pig for slaughter.

707
01:22:03.130 --> 01:22:06.630
Don't tell me now that you've grown
to care for the boy?

708
01:22:11.130 --> 01:22:14.390
Expecto Patronum.

709
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:26.810
Lily.

710
01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:32.070
After all this time?

711
01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:36.990
Always.

712
01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:46.130
So when the time comes...

713
01:22:46.290 --> 01:22:49.300
...the boy must die?

714
01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:52.840
Yes. He must die.

715
01:22:53.010 --> 01:22:56.010
And Voldemort himself must do it.

716
01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:58.640
That is essential.

717
01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:04.750
Where've you been?

718
01:24:04.910 --> 01:24:08.080
- We thought you went to the forest.
- I'm going there now.

719
01:24:08.250 --> 01:24:11.210
Are you mad? No.

720
01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:14.420
You can't give yourself up to him.

721
01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:19.680
What is it, Harry?

722
01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:23.140
What is it you know?

723
01:24:25.930 --> 01:24:28.520
There's a reason I can hear them...

724
01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:30.350
...the Horcruxes.

725
01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:35.230
I think I've known for a while.

726
01:24:36.650 --> 01:24:38.950
And I think you have too.

727
01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:45.080
- I'll go with you.
- No, kill the snake.

728
01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:47.960
Kill the snake and then it's just him.

729
01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:10.200
I'm ready to die.

730
01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:53.910
The Resurrection Stone.

731
01:27:23.610 --> 01:27:26.990
You've been so brave, sweetheart.

732
01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:32.950
Why are you here?

733
01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:35.540
All of you?

734
01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:40.090
We never left.

735
01:27:48.970 --> 01:27:50.550
Does it...?

736
01:27:51.310 --> 01:27:52.470
Does it hurt?

737
01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:55.230
Dying?

738
01:27:56.140 --> 01:27:58.690
Quicker than falling asleep.

739
01:28:02.610 --> 01:28:04.900
You're nearly there, son.

740
01:28:05.070 --> 01:28:06.280
I'm sorry.

741
01:28:06.450 --> 01:28:09.950
I never wanted any of you to die for me.

742
01:28:11.530 --> 01:28:13.160
And, Remus, your son...

743
01:28:13.330 --> 01:28:17.580
Others will tell him
what his mother and father died for.

744
01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:21.210
One day, he'll understand.

745
01:28:32.970 --> 01:28:34.520
You'll stay with me?

746
01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:38.350
Until the end.

747
01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:41.020
And he won't be able to see you?

748
01:28:41.190 --> 01:28:42.860
No.

749
01:28:44.150 --> 01:28:46.740
We're here, you see.

750
01:29:01.290 --> 01:29:03.340
Stay close to me.

751
01:29:05.050 --> 01:29:07.210
Always.

752
01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:25.730
No sign of him, my Lord.

753
01:29:41.170 --> 01:29:43.920
I thought he would come.

754
01:30:24.790 --> 01:30:28.460
Harry? No! What are you doing here?

755
01:30:28.630 --> 01:30:29.920
Quiet!

756
01:30:40.930 --> 01:30:43.190
Harry Potter.

757
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:48.980
The Boy Who Lived.

758
01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:55.660
Come to die.

759
01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:15.590
Avada Kedavra!

760
01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:14.650
You can't help. Harry...

761
01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:18.530
...you wonderful boy.

762
01:32:19.030 --> 01:32:22.910
You brave, brave man.

763
01:32:24.910 --> 01:32:26.870
Let us walk.

764
01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:36.590
Professor, what is that?

765
01:32:39.260 --> 01:32:42.300
Something beyond either of our help.

766
01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:48.440
A part of Voldemort sent here to die.

767
01:32:48.810 --> 01:32:50.020
And exactly where are we?

768
01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:55.280
I was going to ask you that.
Where would you say that we are?

769
01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:57.150
Well...

770
01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:59.950
...it looks like King's Cross station.

771
01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:02.620
Only cleaner.

772
01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:04.990
And without all the trains.

773
01:33:05.540 --> 01:33:08.290
King's Cross, is that right?

774
01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:12.210
This is, as they say, your party.

775
01:33:13.380 --> 01:33:16.380
I expect you now realize
that you and Voldemort...

776
01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:19.380
...have been connected by something
other than fate...

777
01:33:19.550 --> 01:33:22.590
...since that night in Godric's Hollow
all those years ago.

778
01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:24.470
So it's true then, sir?

779
01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:27.640
A part of him lives within me, doesn't it?

780
01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:28.980
Did.

781
01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:33.980
It was just destroyed many moments ago
by none other than Voldemort himself.

782
01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:39.740
You were the Horcrux
he never meant to make, Harry.

783
01:33:52.290 --> 01:33:53.830
I have to go back, haven't I?

784
01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.880
Oh. That's up to you.

785
01:33:56.050 --> 01:33:57.840
I have a choice?

786
01:33:58.010 --> 01:33:59.800
Oh, yes.

787
01:33:59.970 --> 01:34:02.800
We're in King's Cross, you say?

788
01:34:03.890 --> 01:34:08.680
I think, if you so desired,
you'd be able to board a train.

789
01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:11.440
And where would it take me?

790
01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:14.860
On.

791
01:34:32.830 --> 01:34:34.920
Voldemort has the Elder Wand.

792
01:34:37.550 --> 01:34:38.590
True.

793
01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:41.550
- And the snake's still alive.
- Yes.

794
01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:44.300
And I've nothing to kill it with.

795
01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:49.560
Help will always be given at Hogwarts,
Harry, to those who ask for it.

796
01:34:50.770 --> 01:34:54.480
I've always prized myself
on my ability to turn a phrase.

797
01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:58.570
Words are,
in my not so humble opinion...

798
01:34:58.730 --> 01:35:02.320
...our most inexhaustible
source of magic...

799
01:35:02.490 --> 01:35:06.820
...capable of both inflicting injury
and remedying it.

800
01:35:07.450 --> 01:35:13.370
But I would, in this case,
amend my original statement to this:

801
01:35:16.170 --> 01:35:22.340
Help will always be given at Hogwarts
to those who deserve it.

802
01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:30.930
Do not pity the dead, Harry.

803
01:35:31.390 --> 01:35:33.430
Pity the living.

804
01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:38.860
And, above all,
all those who live without love.

805
01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:45.240
Professor, my mother's Patronus
was a doe, wasn't it?

806
01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:48.910
That's the same as Professor Snape's.

807
01:35:49.780 --> 01:35:51.870
It's curious, don't you think?

808
01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:57.000
Actually, if I think about it,
it doesn't seem curious at all.

809
01:35:58.710 --> 01:36:00.880
I'll be going now, Harry.

810
01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:02.750
Professor?

811
01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:09.430
Is this all real?

812
01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:11.930
Or is it just happening inside my head?

813
01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:15.640
Of course it's happening inside
your head, Harry.

814
01:36:15.810 --> 01:36:19.560
Why should that mean that it's not real?

815
01:36:25.150 --> 01:36:27.780
Professor? What should I do?

816
01:36:32.490 --> 01:36:34.290
Professor?

817
01:36:37.670 --> 01:36:38.960
My Lord?

818
01:36:39.130 --> 01:36:41.250
My Lord, are you hurt? My Lord?

819
01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:43.040
I don't need your help.

820
01:36:43.210 --> 01:36:45.920
No. Come.

821
01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:56.480
The boy.

822
01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:58.560
Is he dead?

823
01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:14.870
Is he alive?

824
01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:17.200
Draco, is he alive?

825
01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:45.400
Dead.

826
01:39:12.570 --> 01:39:15.200
Who is that Hagrid's carrying?

827
01:39:15.870 --> 01:39:17.700
Neville, who is it?

828
01:39:18.370 --> 01:39:20.870
Harry Potter...

829
01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.500
...is dead.

830
01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:25.250
No! No!

831
01:39:25.420 --> 01:39:26.790
Silence.

832
01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:31.500
Stupid girl.

833
01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:37.180
Harry Potter is dead.

834
01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:42.470
From this day forth, you put your faith...

835
01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:43.680
...in me.

836
01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:56.530
Harry Potter is dead!

837
01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:04.830
And now is the time to declare yourself.

838
01:40:06.370 --> 01:40:09.130
Come forward and join us.

839
01:40:11.050 --> 01:40:12.750
Or die.

840
01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:19.340
Draco.

841
01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:26.890
Draco.

842
01:40:29.770 --> 01:40:31.690
Draco...

843
01:40:34.530 --> 01:40:36.400
...come.

844
01:40:47.420 --> 01:40:50.830
Ah. Well done, Draco.

845
01:40:51.630 --> 01:40:53.500
Well done.

846
01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:18.820
Well, I must say I'd hoped for better.

847
01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:26.120
And who might you be, young man?

848
01:41:27.410 --> 01:41:29.330
Neville Longbottom.

849
01:41:34.630 --> 01:41:38.340
Well, Neville, I'm sure we can
find a place for you in our ranks.

850
01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:40.760
I'd like to say something.

851
01:41:46.890 --> 01:41:52.650
Well, Neville, I'm sure we'd all be
fascinated to hear what you have to say.

852
01:41:55.650 --> 01:41:58.150
- It doesn't matter Harry's gone.
- Stand down, Neville.

853
01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:00.950
People die every day.

854
01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:06.660
Friends, family.

855
01:42:08.700 --> 01:42:10.290
Yeah.

856
01:42:11.710 --> 01:42:13.880
We lost Harry tonight.

857
01:42:15.420 --> 01:42:19.920
But he's still with us, in here.

858
01:42:20.930 --> 01:42:22.840
So's Fred...

859
01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:25.640
...and Remus.

860
01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:28.060
Tonks.

861
01:42:29.390 --> 01:42:31.310
All of them.

862
01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:34.730
They didn't die in vain.

863
01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:40.940
But you will.

864
01:42:41.110 --> 01:42:43.490
- Because you're wrong.
- Ha-ha-ha.

865
01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:46.450
Harry's heart did beat for us.
For all of us. This is not over!

866
01:42:52.540 --> 01:42:54.370
Confringo!

867
01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:04.220
No! No, come back!

868
01:43:04.390 --> 01:43:08.350
Lucius! Come back! Come back and fight!

869
01:43:08.510 --> 01:43:10.560
Come back!

870
01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:18.770
I'll lure him into the castle.
We have to kill the snake.

871
01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:20.860
- You'll need this.
- Neville!

872
01:46:14.410 --> 01:46:16.910
Not my daughter, you bitch.

873
01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:51.740
You were right...

874
01:46:53.490 --> 01:46:55.820
...when you told Snape
that wand was failing you.

875
01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:57.660
It will always fail you.

876
01:46:58.950 --> 01:47:00.540
I killed Snape.

877
01:47:00.700 --> 01:47:02.830
But what if the wand
never belonged to Snape?

878
01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.880
What if its allegiance was always
to someone else?

879
01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:09.250
Come on, Tom.
Let's finish this the way we started it.

880
01:47:09.710 --> 01:47:10.760
Together.

881
01:50:45.220 --> 01:50:47.220
- Ha, ha.
- I always figured he would be a big fellow.

882
01:50:47.390 --> 01:50:51.730
I couldn't find my wand.
I haven't lost my wand in my entire life.

883
01:50:51.890 --> 01:50:53.890
It was lost in the folds of my gowns.

884
01:50:54.060 --> 01:50:56.860
I managed to find it
and I dispatched a few of them...

885
01:50:57.020 --> 01:50:58.270
Harry.

886
01:51:58.750 --> 01:52:02.420
Why didn't it work for him,
the Elder Wand?

887
01:52:03.420 --> 01:52:05.340
It answered to somebody else.

888
01:52:06.300 --> 01:52:09.100
When he killed Snape,
he thought the wand would become his.

889
01:52:09.260 --> 01:52:13.430
But the thing is,
the wand never belonged to Snape.

890
01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:18.100
It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore
that night in the astronomy tower.

891
01:52:18.270 --> 01:52:22.270
From that moment on,
the wand answered to him.

892
01:52:23.150 --> 01:52:24.990
Until...

893
01:52:25.150 --> 01:52:29.740
...the other night
when I disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor.

894
01:52:29.910 --> 01:52:32.030
So that means...

895
01:52:33.580 --> 01:52:35.330
It's mine.

896
01:52:37.290 --> 01:52:38.790
What should we do with it?

897
01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:40.960
We?

898
01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:45.590
I'm just saying, that's the Elder Wand,
the most powerful wand in the world.

899
01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:49.680
With that, we'd be invincible.

900
01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:14.490
Together.

901
01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:33.970
Look after each other.

902
01:55:53.150 --> 01:55:54.950
- Bag?
- Yeah.

903
01:55:55.110 --> 01:55:56.160
Jumper?

904
01:55:57.820 --> 01:55:59.830
I'll miss you.

905
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:02.660
Here they come.

906
01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:22.060
Dad, what if I am put in Slytherin?

907
01:56:24.350 --> 01:56:26.890
Albus Severus Potter...

908
01:56:28.190 --> 01:56:31.900
...you were named after two headmasters
of Hogwarts.

909
01:56:32.070 --> 01:56:33.690
One of them was a Slytherin...

910
01:56:33.860 --> 01:56:37.070
...and he was the bravest man
I've ever known.

911
01:56:38.950 --> 01:56:40.200
But just say that I am.

912
01:56:40.370 --> 01:56:46.000
Then Slytherin House will have gained
a wonderful young wizard.

913
01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:51.880
But, listen, if it really means that much
to you, you can choose Gryffindor.

914
01:56:52.050 --> 01:56:54.960
The Sorting Hat
takes your choice into account.

915
01:56:55.550 --> 01:56:57.590
- Really?
- Really.

916
01:56:58.970 --> 01:57:01.640
- Bye, Mum.
- All aboard.

917
01:57:01.810 --> 01:57:02.850
Ready?

918
01:57:03.010 --> 01:57:04.560
Ready.

919
01:57:16.820 --> 01:57:18.450
Come on, Jay, get a move on.

920
01:57:18.610 --> 01:57:20.070
Come on.
