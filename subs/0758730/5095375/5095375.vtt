1
00:02:57.502 --> 00:02:59.237
Ok now, take your time.

2
00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:01.940
There you go.

3
00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:17.939
Dad, Dad, it's up here!

4
00:03:21.626 --> 00:03:22.938
Slow down, Sam.

5
00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:24.394
Slow down.

6
00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.053
There.

7
00:04:00.554 --> 00:04:01.990
You show this to the sheriff.

8
00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:11.008
Come on, Sam.
Come on, let's go. Go!

9
00:04:17.865 --> 00:04:19.159
Move it! Go, go!

10
00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:21.719
Keep moving, Sam.

11
00:04:27.558 --> 00:04:28.643
Sam, you all right?

12
00:04:29.727 --> 00:04:30.804
Stay down.

13
00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:41.030
I'm scared.

14
00:04:56.754 --> 00:04:57.847
Watch out!

15
00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:12.662
Dad!

16
00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:24.031
Dad?

17
00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:21.349
How you doing, Dallas?

18
00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:23.242
Eddie.

19
00:07:24.026 --> 00:07:25.511
Come on, I'll give you a ride.

20
00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:43.604
Yeah, I usually ride in the back.

21
00:07:44.088 --> 00:07:46.407
Seem to remember you being with me
a couple of those times.

22
00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:48.802
You got work lined up?

23
00:07:49.727 --> 00:07:50.927
Why? You hiring?

24
00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:55.124
I got enough trouble convincing people
I belong in the job.

25
00:07:55.808 --> 00:07:57.451
But I'll ask around town for you.

26
00:07:58.436 --> 00:07:59.804
I appreciate it.

27
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:02.258
You...

28
00:08:03.159 --> 00:08:04.341
seen my brother?

29
00:08:05.401 --> 00:08:07.336
Actually, I've been seeing him too much.

30
00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:17.005
Gotta wear the hat.

31
00:08:18.389 --> 00:08:21.090
Drew, the only reason
you make us wear a hat,

32
00:08:21.091 --> 00:08:23.577
is because some manager made you wear
a hat when you were a driver.

33
00:08:24.061 --> 00:08:25.937
Look, the only reason you got this job,

34
00:08:26.122 --> 00:08:28.857
is because your guidance counsellor
begged me to give it to you.

35
00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:32.329
Yeah, I'm sure the fact that she's hot
had nothing to do with that?

36
00:08:34.972 --> 00:08:36.440
1427 Watercrest.

37
00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:40.186
I can't make that delivery.

38
00:08:40.487 --> 00:08:41.611
Have Barry do it.

39
00:08:42.396 --> 00:08:43.397
This is not a democracy.

40
00:08:43.698 --> 00:08:45.457
Make the run or you're fired.

41
00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:51.906
And wear the hat.

42
00:08:57.703 --> 00:09:00.680
<i>This is R-31-David investigating
a 10-66</i>

43
00:09:00.765 --> 00:09:01.807
<i>at sewerjunction 4.</i>

44
00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:04.644
<i>Copy that R-31-David.</i>

45
00:09:35.816 --> 00:09:36.269
Harry,

46
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:38.911
we keep telling you guys,

47
00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:40.755
to stay out of here
and you keep coming back.

48
00:09:42.039 --> 00:09:44.392
I hate to do this,
but I'm gonna have to take you in.

49
00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:46.769
Let me just get my dog.

50
00:09:48.796 --> 00:09:49.714
Butch!

51
00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:52.800
Butch.

52
00:09:54.184 --> 00:09:55.038
Come here, boy.

53
00:09:55.439 --> 00:09:56.536
What is that?

54
00:10:00.007 --> 00:10:01.042
Jesus!

55
00:10:03.126 --> 00:10:04.303
Sheriff? Sheriff?

56
00:10:59.283 --> 00:11:00.324
Hey, Ricky.

57
00:11:00.825 --> 00:11:01.826
Hi, Jesse.

58
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:03.546
Come on in.

59
00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:06.719
Can I get you something to drink?

60
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.650
I'm good, thanks.

61
00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:10.067
Cute outfit, Ricky.

62
00:11:10.368 --> 00:11:12.420
Yeah, isn't Halloween in October?

63
00:11:14.256 --> 00:11:16.601
At least now I know who ordered
the Sausage Lover's.

64
00:11:17.885 --> 00:11:19.578
My purse is in the kitchen.

65
00:11:24.975 --> 00:11:26.292
I'm sorry.

66
00:11:26.793 --> 00:11:28.328
He can be such an asshole.

67
00:11:29.013 --> 00:11:29.862
Yeah well...

68
00:11:30.763 --> 00:11:32.424
you've always known how
to pick them, Jess.

69
00:11:33.309 --> 00:11:35.010
Well, I'll let you in on a little secret.

70
00:11:35.895 --> 00:11:37.463
Quietly I'm getting ready to fire him.

71
00:11:39.148 --> 00:11:40.021
Fire him.

72
00:11:40.722 --> 00:11:41.800
That's funny.

73
00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:43.786
So, what do I owe you?

74
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.163
$53.50.

75
00:11:49.074 --> 00:11:50.151
Keep it.

76
00:11:51.535 --> 00:11:52.536
Thanks.

77
00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.490
I'll see you later.

78
00:12:09.052 --> 00:12:09.711
Come on!

79
00:12:10.596 --> 00:12:10.814
Dale!

80
00:12:11.315 --> 00:12:12.431
Dale, stop it!

81
00:12:13.515 --> 00:12:15.135
Was that laugh you got worth it?

82
00:12:15.936 --> 00:12:17.085
No answer?

83
00:12:17.169 --> 00:12:18.321
Dale, leave him alone!

84
00:12:23.901 --> 00:12:25.085
Give me my keys.

85
00:12:29.448 --> 00:12:31.834
Hope you can find them
in 30 minutes or less, asshole.

86
00:12:33.118 --> 00:12:34.828
Let's go.
Bitch.

87
00:12:43.921 --> 00:12:45.131
Let's go, Jesse.

88
00:13:41.145 --> 00:13:42.439
Ray, you find anything?

89
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.924
<i>Nothing.
Anyone parked at the turnout?</i>

90
00:13:46.608 --> 00:13:47.868
Buddy Benson's truck.

91
00:13:48.652 --> 00:13:49.375
<i>Jesus, Eddie.</i>

92
00:13:50.076 --> 00:13:51.947
<i>He usually goes out with his kid.</i>

93
00:14:22.561 --> 00:14:23.045
Dad?

94
00:14:27.024 --> 00:14:27.783
Dad?

95
00:15:11.193 --> 00:15:12.210
Hey.

96
00:15:12.694 --> 00:15:14.196
I missed you so much.

97
00:15:16.115 --> 00:15:17.299
She's so big.
I know.

98
00:15:18.283 --> 00:15:19.127
Hey.
God.

99
00:15:19.128 --> 00:15:20.503
I can't believe you're home.

100
00:15:24.123 --> 00:15:25.416
God, it's been so long.

101
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.294
Do you want some help?

102
00:15:31.213 --> 00:15:32.440
Are these for me?

103
00:15:36.844 --> 00:15:38.078
You don't like them?

104
00:15:38.762 --> 00:15:39.895
Are you kidding me?

105
00:15:39.996 --> 00:15:41.373
These are so cool.

106
00:15:42.975 --> 00:15:44.418
We'll show you how they work later, ok?

107
00:15:45.602 --> 00:15:46.146
Alright.

108
00:16:05.247 --> 00:16:06.615
You got a problem with the door?

109
00:16:09.835 --> 00:16:10.841
When did you get back?

110
00:16:11.242 --> 00:16:12.328
Today.

111
00:16:12.713 --> 00:16:14.023
What happened to your face?

112
00:16:16.008 --> 00:16:17.386
We'll talk about it later.
Ricky.

113
00:16:19.211 --> 00:16:19.869
Hey.

114
00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:21.596
We'll talk about it later.
No. Let's talk about it now.

115
00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.259
Get your fucking hands off me!

116
00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.584
Get your fucking hands off me!
What happened to your face?

117
00:16:26.768 --> 00:16:28.699
Dale Collins and his friends jumped me.

118
00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.580
They threw my keys in the sewer.

119
00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:33.900
Ok give me the bat.

120
00:16:36.178 --> 00:16:37.257
What are you doing here, Dallas?
Ricky.

121
00:16:37.458 --> 00:16:38.587
What are you doing?
I'm not gonna ask.

122
00:16:38.588 --> 00:16:39.848
Give me the fucking bat!

123
00:16:46.788 --> 00:16:47.788
Come on.

124
00:16:48.457 --> 00:16:49.741
I'll help you find your keys.

125
00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.666
Butch. Shut up!

126
00:18:06.743 --> 00:18:07.811
Harry?

127
00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:12.357
You better save some for me.

128
00:18:15.335 --> 00:18:16.903
Oh, my God!

129
00:18:17.787 --> 00:18:18.963
Harry.

130
00:18:37.274 --> 00:18:38.292
Please.

131
00:22:42.143 --> 00:22:43.185
Mom!

132
00:22:43.186 --> 00:22:44.629
I'm sorry, it's your bedtime, honey.

133
00:22:46.273 --> 00:22:47.874
I'm not sleepy yet.

134
00:22:52.612 --> 00:22:54.797
Molly, put those away.

135
00:22:55.282 --> 00:22:56.467
It's time for bed.

136
00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:01.563
I love you.

137
00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:08.970
I want Dad to read it.

138
00:23:12.465 --> 00:23:13.465
Ok.

139
00:23:17.762 --> 00:23:18.964
I love you.

140
00:23:21.208 --> 00:23:22.510
I'll see you in the morning.

141
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:40.909
Hey.

142
00:23:41.536 --> 00:23:44.431
You remember all those times you told me
how much you missed Mommy?

143
00:23:46.499 --> 00:23:48.017
It's ok to tell Mommy that.

144
00:23:50.295 --> 00:23:51.181
Ok.

145
00:23:59.137 --> 00:23:59.809
Hurry up.

146
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:02.022
You wanna do it?

147
00:24:02.307 --> 00:24:03.736
You're the convict in the family.

148
00:24:04.537 --> 00:24:05.526
Funny.

149
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:07.020
Help me out, alright.

150
00:24:14.986 --> 00:24:16.938
Why don't we climb down
from where they threw your keys?

151
00:24:17.822 --> 00:24:20.050
So Jesse can see me climb out covered in shit?

152
00:24:20.351 --> 00:24:21.355
No, thanks.

153
00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:24.087
Wait a second.
We're gonna be covered in shit?

154
00:24:24.871 --> 00:24:25.981
Take this.

155
00:24:38.643 --> 00:24:40.269
It's gross down here.

156
00:24:41.053 --> 00:24:42.606
I can think of worse places.

157
00:24:56.945 --> 00:24:58.146
Guess nobody's home.

158
00:24:59.431 --> 00:25:00.573
Is that a couch?

159
00:25:01.658 --> 00:25:02.666
Yeah.

160
00:25:02.951 --> 00:25:04.252
It's nicer than ours.

161
00:25:12.335 --> 00:25:13.454
What the hell?

162
00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:32.565
It smells like something died down here.

163
00:25:36.317 --> 00:25:37.811
Are you sure this is the right way?

164
00:25:39.696 --> 00:25:41.098
This should be it right up here.

165
00:25:44.476 --> 00:25:45.673
That's the drain.

166
00:25:46.574 --> 00:25:47.678
Check down there.

167
00:25:48.163 --> 00:25:49.664
They're your keys, asshole.

168
00:25:51.875 --> 00:25:52.920
You got hands.

169
00:25:53.045 --> 00:25:55.145
Yeah, I'm not sticking them in that shit,
you do it.

170
00:26:00.859 --> 00:26:02.194
Knock yourself out.

171
00:26:10.977 --> 00:26:12.261
Tell me about this girl.

172
00:26:13.146 --> 00:26:14.095
What girl?

173
00:26:14.096 --> 00:26:15.739
The one you got your ass kicked over.

174
00:26:16.024 --> 00:26:17.208
She's just a girl.

175
00:26:19.277 --> 00:26:22.631
No one goes digging around through shit
over just some girl, ok?

176
00:26:28.128 --> 00:26:29.320
What the hell was that?

177
00:26:29.321 --> 00:26:30.871
What relax, it's a rat.

178
00:26:30.955 --> 00:26:31.981
Fucking rat.

179
00:26:34.834 --> 00:26:35.952
Alright check that drain.

180
00:27:00.693 --> 00:27:01.712
I got them.

181
00:27:07.425 --> 00:27:08.509
Let's go.

182
00:27:11.246 --> 00:27:12.463
Sam!

183
00:27:13.248 --> 00:27:14.823
Ray, head towards the ridge.

184
00:27:16.024 --> 00:27:17.702
Sammy, where are you?

185
00:27:19.087 --> 00:27:20.179
Buddy.

186
00:27:21.089 --> 00:27:22.090
Buddy!

187
00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:26.811
Sam!

188
00:27:28.054 --> 00:27:29.430
Kelly, bring them in.

189
00:27:30.515 --> 00:27:32.374
Where are you, Buddy?

190
00:27:35.436 --> 00:27:36.646
Buddy!

191
00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:38.889
Buddy!

192
00:27:39.274 --> 00:27:40.550
Buddy!

193
00:27:41.734 --> 00:27:44.771
We won't stop looking for you, Sammy!

194
00:28:12.307 --> 00:28:13.108
Eddie?

195
00:28:14.392 --> 00:28:15.927
Darcy, we'll start up again tomorrow.

196
00:28:18.438 --> 00:28:20.474
My husband and my son are out there...

197
00:28:20.875 --> 00:28:21.875
somewhere.

198
00:28:23.735 --> 00:28:25.353
They wouldn't stop looking for me.

199
00:28:27.989 --> 00:28:29.004
Do you think that...

200
00:28:30.905 --> 00:28:32.118
something happened?

201
00:28:32.702 --> 00:28:33.895
I don't know.

202
00:28:36.372 --> 00:28:37.891
Why don't you go home
and get some rest.

203
00:28:39.075 --> 00:28:40.344
Come on, we need your strength.

204
00:28:44.589 --> 00:28:45.224
Right.

205
00:28:51.262 --> 00:28:52.321
Ray, anything?

206
00:28:52.805 --> 00:28:54.807
<i>Negative.
I'll make a final pass by the ridge.</i>

207
00:28:55.391 --> 00:28:57.821
Alright, keep in touch.
Otherwise, I'll see you in the morning.

208
00:29:45.942 --> 00:29:47.394
<i>All units, report back...</i>

209
00:30:28.484 --> 00:30:29.605
Excuse me, sir.

210
00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:31.490
If you've seen my husband and my son.

211
00:30:31.491 --> 00:30:32.430
Ok.
Thank you.

212
00:30:33.489 --> 00:30:34.459
Pardon me.

213
00:30:34.484 --> 00:30:36.984
If I can I give you this.
This is my husband and my son.

214
00:30:37.243 --> 00:30:38.282
Just keep an eye.
Of course.

215
00:30:38.983 --> 00:30:39.995
Thank you.

216
00:30:41.622 --> 00:30:43.015
How's the job hunt going?

217
00:30:43.016 --> 00:30:45.568
Is breaking and entering a special skill?

218
00:30:46.753 --> 00:30:48.046
You got any suggestions?

219
00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:50.791
I hear the bank's hiring.

220
00:30:59.724 --> 00:31:00.459
Hey.

221
00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:01.734
Morning.

222
00:31:07.398 --> 00:31:09.242
Any word on Buddy and his kid?

223
00:31:10.526 --> 00:31:11.169
Carrie?

224
00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:12.570
Coffee, please.

225
00:31:15.948 --> 00:31:17.377
You guys have been out all night?

226
00:31:17.378 --> 00:31:19.136
No, we called it off at 2am.

227
00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.333
Ray didn't come home?

228
00:31:23.558 --> 00:31:25.132
I thought he was with you.

229
00:31:25.633 --> 00:31:26.858
I tried his cellphone.

230
00:31:26.918 --> 00:31:28.302
Carrie, listen to me.

231
00:31:29.087 --> 00:31:31.964
Ray was pushing real hard last night.
I'm sure he's still looking.

232
00:31:32.548 --> 00:31:35.077
Cell reception out there...
He always calls, Eddie.

233
00:31:43.935 --> 00:31:44.817
Ray!

234
00:31:49.618 --> 00:31:50.518
Ray!

235
00:31:53.945 --> 00:31:55.255
Ray, are you down there?

236
00:32:00.118 --> 00:32:01.202
Ray?

237
00:32:21.556 --> 00:32:22.640
Oh, my God.

238
00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:38.248
I can't believe this is Ray Adams.

239
00:32:44.871 --> 00:32:46.389
I don't want to believe it either.

240
00:32:48.958 --> 00:32:51.002
You know what it would take
for a man to do this?

241
00:32:52.086 --> 00:32:55.005
For someone to skin a human being?

242
00:32:56.174 --> 00:32:57.306
No tracks.

243
00:32:58.207 --> 00:32:59.218
Nothing?

244
00:33:01.429 --> 00:33:02.264
Eddie.

245
00:33:04.265 --> 00:33:05.616
You're in over your head.

246
00:33:06.876 --> 00:33:08.094
What are you gonna do?

247
00:33:09.478 --> 00:33:10.947
I'll let you know when I figure it out.

248
00:33:22.274 --> 00:33:22.941
Hey.

249
00:33:23.326 --> 00:33:24.211
Hey, Jesse.

250
00:33:24.912 --> 00:33:25.678
Hi.

251
00:33:31.083 --> 00:33:33.044
You know, you look at me
that same way in class.

252
00:33:34.629 --> 00:33:35.634
Yeah well...

253
00:33:36.035 --> 00:33:37.331
the clock's behind you.

254
00:33:37.715 --> 00:33:38.325
What?

255
00:33:40.009 --> 00:33:42.319
Tomorrow when you're in class,
turn around, you'll see it.

256
00:33:42.803 --> 00:33:43.421
Yeah I...

257
00:33:44.322 --> 00:33:45.865
I know that it's there but...

258
00:33:47.808 --> 00:33:49.769
We both know that's not what
you're looking at.

259
00:33:53.856 --> 00:33:55.408
You know, you never were a good liar.

260
00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.453
Want to go swimming tonight?

261
00:34:00.954 --> 00:34:01.634
Swimming?

262
00:34:03.235 --> 00:34:04.007
Where?

263
00:34:04.492 --> 00:34:05.492
At school.

264
00:34:06.702 --> 00:34:08.279
Come on, it'll be like old times.

265
00:34:10.373 --> 00:34:12.117
Old times, like before you had a boyfriend?

266
00:34:14.001 --> 00:34:14.844
Yeah.

267
00:34:16.128 --> 00:34:18.014
And it's ex-boyfriend actually.

268
00:34:19.799 --> 00:34:21.117
He's been fired.

269
00:34:23.261 --> 00:34:25.713
So tonight, around ten.

270
00:34:31.143 --> 00:34:32.395
See you tonight.

271
00:39:05.326 --> 00:39:06.786
I'm closing out now Darcy.

272
00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:09.505
See you when you get here.

273
00:39:18.347 --> 00:39:19.365
You alright?

274
00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.819
Hey, if you wanna talk...

275
00:39:26.021 --> 00:39:27.114
It's ok.

276
00:39:30.067 --> 00:39:31.852
You're welcome to stay
with me and Kathy tonight.

277
00:39:32.736 --> 00:39:34.581
Darcy's coming by.
I'm gonna stay with her.

278
00:39:38.275 --> 00:39:39.576
I'll see you tomorrow.

279
00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:54.418
Ritchie?

280
00:39:58.679 --> 00:39:59.439
Ritchie?

281
00:40:01.223 --> 00:40:02.225
No!

282
00:41:10.501 --> 00:41:12.577
We found Ray's body in the woods.

283
00:41:13.462 --> 00:41:14.513
He was...

284
00:41:15.798 --> 00:41:17.265
He was skinned alive.

285
00:41:22.221 --> 00:41:23.259
Think it's got something to do with...

286
00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:25.566
Buddy and his kid disappearing?

287
00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:29.228
I think this kind of thing doesn't
happen here.

288
00:41:30.412 --> 00:41:34.350
<i>Sheriff, we have a report of a gas explosion
in a sewer under 16th, do you copy?</i>

289
00:41:35.734 --> 00:41:38.745
Roger, Dispatch, notify the fire department,
I'll meet them there.

290
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:40.693
<i>Right away, Sheriff. Dispatch out.</i>

291
00:41:40.694 --> 00:41:41.840
You want some help?

292
00:41:42.324 --> 00:41:43.450
I don't know, Dallas.

293
00:41:44.535 --> 00:41:45.619
Come on.

294
00:41:46.203 --> 00:41:47.363
I'll ride in the back.

295
00:43:02.946 --> 00:43:03.711
Ricky.

296
00:43:04.012 --> 00:43:05.191
Hey.
Hey.

297
00:43:07.993 --> 00:43:09.061
So...

298
00:43:10.746 --> 00:43:11.889
how do we get in?

299
00:43:13.373 --> 00:43:15.150
I taped the lock after class.

300
00:43:36.814 --> 00:43:39.609
I couldn't decide on which suit
I wanted to wear so...

301
00:43:46.031 --> 00:43:46.708
Now...

302
00:43:48.409 --> 00:43:49.377
you tell me.

303
00:43:51.161 --> 00:43:52.143
Are you looking at me...

304
00:43:54.144 --> 00:43:55.257
or the clock?

305
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:01.505
Come here.

306
00:44:20.274 --> 00:44:21.275
Oh, my God.

307
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:27.356
What do you think you're doing, Jess?

308
00:44:27.657 --> 00:44:28.923
Dale, get outta here!

309
00:44:29.408 --> 00:44:30.646
Just remember Ricky,

310
00:44:31.547 --> 00:44:33.646
I taught this little slut everything
she knows.

311
00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:36.399
No, Ricky! Stop it!

312
00:44:38.917 --> 00:44:40.618
Stop it!
Dale, stop it!

313
00:44:41.003 --> 00:44:42.346
Stop it!
He's drowning!

314
00:46:11.251 --> 00:46:12.479
What the hell was that?

315
00:46:14.763 --> 00:46:15.489
Oh, my God.

316
00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:17.473
Oh, my God! Get out of the water!

317
00:46:17.474 --> 00:46:18.818
Get out! Go! Go!
Jesse, go!

318
00:46:20.602 --> 00:46:22.513
Oh, my God, get out of the pool!
Jess, run!

319
00:46:23.897 --> 00:46:25.481
Help me!

320
00:46:25.565 --> 00:46:27.566
Oh, my God!
Help me!

321
00:46:30.153 --> 00:46:31.638
Get out!
Go!

322
00:46:34.224 --> 00:46:35.304
Do you think he's dead?

323
00:46:35.305 --> 00:46:37.043
Why don't you go back and find out?

324
00:46:39.621 --> 00:46:40.814
No!
Here!

325
00:46:43.458 --> 00:46:44.543
Window!

326
00:46:51.124 --> 00:46:52.483
Shit!
Oh, shit!

327
00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:55.720
Fuck!

328
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:57.048
Come on!

329
00:46:57.949 --> 00:46:58.723
Help me!

330
00:47:01.768 --> 00:47:02.463
Ricky!

331
00:47:02.864 --> 00:47:03.711
Come on!

332
00:47:04.396 --> 00:47:05.080
Go!

333
00:47:26.168 --> 00:47:27.168
Daddy!

334
00:47:27.413 --> 00:47:28.453
Daddy!

335
00:47:29.337 --> 00:47:30.423
Daddy!
Molly?

336
00:47:30.924 --> 00:47:31.724
What is it?

337
00:47:33.258 --> 00:47:34.843
It was outside the window.

338
00:47:35.927 --> 00:47:38.637
What?
It was a monster.

339
00:47:41.541 --> 00:47:42.541
Come here.

340
00:47:46.588 --> 00:47:47.829
You know, when I was your age...

341
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:50.116
I used to have these awful nightmares.

342
00:47:50.901 --> 00:47:53.194
I saw it. It was real.

343
00:47:56.281 --> 00:47:57.941
You see?
No monster.

344
00:48:02.279 --> 00:48:03.821
Tim!
Daddy!

345
00:48:03.905 --> 00:48:05.064
Run!

346
00:48:09.294 --> 00:48:10.913
We have to go!
Come on!

347
00:48:12.297 --> 00:48:13.407
Daddy!

348
00:49:11.323 --> 00:49:13.023
The fire spread through the plant.

349
00:49:13.024 --> 00:49:15.051
They have to shut down
the reactors manually.

350
00:49:15.235 --> 00:49:16.295
Roger that.

351
00:49:17.779 --> 00:49:18.616
Dispatch,

352
00:49:18.917 --> 00:49:21.157
we have to evacuate the entire town.

353
00:49:21.741 --> 00:49:24.702
Call the National Guard in Colorado Springs for assistance.

354
00:49:24.703 --> 00:49:25.212
Over.

355
00:49:26.496 --> 00:49:27.573
Jesus Christ.

356
00:49:28.957 --> 00:49:29.999
Sheriff.
Yeah.

357
00:49:30.083 --> 00:49:31.601
I think you should hear about this.

358
00:49:31.726 --> 00:49:32.485
Dallas!

359
00:49:32.586 --> 00:49:33.515
Alright, thank a lot.

360
00:49:33.516 --> 00:49:35.026
Hey, Ricky, what the hell you doing here?

361
00:49:35.027 --> 00:49:36.964
I saw something came after us!
I don't know what happened.

362
00:49:36.965 --> 00:49:37.967
What do you mean something came after us?

363
00:49:37.968 --> 00:49:38.924
We ran all the way here.
Slow down.

364
00:49:38.925 --> 00:49:40.050
What came after you?
I don't know!

365
00:49:40.051 --> 00:49:41.737
Where were you?
We were at the school.

366
00:49:41.838 --> 00:49:44.508
Mark's dead and I think
they got Nick, too.

367
00:49:44.709 --> 00:49:45.615
What was it?

368
00:49:47.017 --> 00:49:47.735
Ricky!

369
00:49:49.519 --> 00:49:50.519
I don't know.

370
00:50:52.332 --> 00:50:53.168
Call in help.

371
00:50:53.769 --> 00:50:55.093
Somebody's gotta know about this.

372
00:50:57.712 --> 00:50:58.339
Eddie!

373
00:51:02.959 --> 00:51:04.251
Dispatch, where's that backup?

374
00:51:04.952 --> 00:51:06.370
Dispatch, come in.

375
00:51:10.517 --> 00:51:11.968
Dispatch, come in.

376
00:51:14.729 --> 00:51:15.940
Let's go. Let's get the hell outta here.

377
00:51:21.945 --> 00:51:22.954
Carrie?

378
00:51:26.241 --> 00:51:27.241
Carrie!

379
00:51:27.626 --> 00:51:28.836
The power's out.

380
00:51:32.622 --> 00:51:33.581
Carrie?

381
00:51:36.042 --> 00:51:36.710
You...

382
00:51:39.629 --> 00:51:41.132
Oh, God! Help me!

383
00:51:48.305 --> 00:51:49.540
Hurry! Hurry!

384
00:51:51.224 --> 00:51:52.526
Stay together!

385
00:52:04.362 --> 00:52:05.481
No!
Hurry!

386
00:52:50.075 --> 00:52:52.385
I don't think the police station
isn't such a hot idea.

387
00:52:52.869 --> 00:52:53.815
What do you want me to do?

388
00:52:53.816 --> 00:52:55.313
We don't know what we're dealing with.

389
00:52:56.498 --> 00:52:58.249
Come on.
Look out!

390
00:53:01.669 --> 00:53:02.351
Sheriff!

391
00:53:02.552 --> 00:53:03.304
Sheriff!

392
00:53:03.429 --> 00:53:04.088
Darcy?

393
00:53:04.089 --> 00:53:05.389
Eddie.
Darcy, what happened?

394
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:06.684
What are you doing?
In the diner...

395
00:53:06.685 --> 00:53:08.242
What?
Carrie's stomach.

396
00:53:08.426 --> 00:53:09.694
There was so much blood.
What?

397
00:53:10.178 --> 00:53:11.894
Her stomach, it was gone.

398
00:53:11.895 --> 00:53:12.980
She's dead.

399
00:53:13.264 --> 00:53:15.574
She's dead! She's dead!

400
00:53:16.059 --> 00:53:17.536
Ricky, get her inside.

401
00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:19.913
Get her in.

402
00:53:23.383 --> 00:53:24.627
Eddie, people are dying.

403
00:53:26.511 --> 00:53:27.525
We need guns.

404
00:53:28.326 --> 00:53:30.039
The National Guard will be here soon.

405
00:53:30.423 --> 00:53:31.575
Not soon enough!

406
00:53:42.677 --> 00:53:44.362
I can't believe I'm letting you do this.

407
00:53:45.046 --> 00:53:47.565
This plan is stupid.
Let's just leave town now.

408
00:53:48.049 --> 00:53:50.534
Because we're not going to make it
out of town without weapons, dickhead.

409
00:53:50.718 --> 00:53:52.846
You're too stupid to talk, Dale.
Shut up.

410
00:54:09.446 --> 00:54:10.237
Where are the guns?

411
00:54:10.938 --> 00:54:11.939
Follow me.

412
00:54:21.624 --> 00:54:22.709
Here they are.

413
00:54:26.337 --> 00:54:27.392
Dale, grab some bags.

414
00:54:27.793 --> 00:54:28.865
Jesse, load them up.

415
00:54:34.637 --> 00:54:35.759
Eddie, you got power on that thing?

416
00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:39.441
Yeah, I just need some light.

417
00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:56.700
Go, go, go!

418
00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:58.736
<i>Ground One, secure the area.</i>

419
00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:01.473
<i>Set up perimeter,
and provide cover for Ground Two.</i>

420
00:55:02.957 --> 00:55:04.241
Roger. 0-6 out.

421
00:55:04.626 --> 00:55:06.994
<i>Move, move, move!
Report status.</i>

422
00:55:07.378 --> 00:55:08.823
<i>Ground One has secure perimeter.</i>

423
00:55:09.124 --> 00:55:10.815
<i>Ground Two has secure perimeter.</i>

424
00:55:15.954 --> 00:55:18.272
This is Sheriff Morales for
the National Guard. Come in.

425
00:55:18.556 --> 00:55:21.133
Repeat, Sheriff Morales
for the National Guard. Come in.

426
00:55:21.518 --> 00:55:25.104
<i>This is Lieutenant Woods, 89th Troop
Command, Colorado National Guard.</i>

427
00:55:25.688 --> 00:55:26.723
Go ahead, Sheriff.

428
00:55:27.407 --> 00:55:29.442
What's your location, Lieutenant? Over.

429
00:55:30.426 --> 00:55:31.560
We're on Main Street.

430
00:55:31.945 --> 00:55:34.330
<i>Listen Lieutenant, I don't know what
your men are walking into,</i>

431
00:55:34.331 --> 00:55:36.099
<i>but our situation is getting worse.</i>

432
00:55:45.458 --> 00:55:46.968
<i>Lieutenant, come in. Are you there?</i>

433
00:55:47.752 --> 00:55:48.855
<i>We have a missing man.</i>

434
00:55:48.856 --> 00:55:49.979
Hold on, Sheriff.

435
00:56:09.306 --> 00:56:10.508
<i>We got contact!</i>

436
00:56:11.693 --> 00:56:12.995
<i>It's a fucking ambush!</i>

437
00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:17.031
Benson, nine o'clock!

438
00:56:18.116 --> 00:56:19.593
What the hell's going on out there?

439
00:56:26.583 --> 00:56:28.301
<i>We got contact all around us!</i>

440
00:56:31.713 --> 00:56:33.631
Fall back!
I repeat, fall back!

441
00:56:34.215 --> 00:56:35.215
Lieutenant!

442
00:56:38.261 --> 00:56:39.429
<i>Fall back!</i>

443
00:56:44.601 --> 00:56:45.810
Lieutenant, are you there?

444
00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:49.172
Lieutenant, come in.
Are you there?

445
00:56:58.531 --> 00:57:00.050
We're not gonna make it, are we?

446
00:57:09.659 --> 00:57:11.310
Don't shoot.
Take what you want.

447
00:57:11.494 --> 00:57:13.547
I'm not getting killed for no $6.25 an hour.

448
00:57:17.592 --> 00:57:18.592
We've been attacked.

449
00:57:19.313 --> 00:57:20.554
Terrorists hit Gunnison?

450
00:57:22.138 --> 00:57:23.423
I told you they would one day.

451
00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:26.776
What are you guys, stoned?

452
00:57:31.939 --> 00:57:32.966
You see that?

453
00:57:38.863 --> 00:57:40.890
<i>Hurry up, Molly.
Hurry up.</i>

454
00:57:42.408 --> 00:57:43.089
Hello?

455
00:57:47.075 --> 00:57:48.075
Hello?

456
00:57:51.876 --> 00:57:53.036
Are you hurt?

457
00:57:55.505 --> 00:57:56.548
Come on in.

458
00:57:58.032 --> 00:57:59.242
She'll be safe here.

459
00:58:03.888 --> 00:58:05.623
<i>Dr Lawson to O.R 2, stat.</i>

460
00:58:06.307 --> 00:58:08.042
<i>Dr Lawson to O.R 2, stat.</i>

461
00:58:10.269 --> 00:58:11.855
Keep pressure on that
and run another litre.

462
00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:14.541
Hold up.

463
00:58:18.111 --> 00:58:19.937
Barely got a carotid.
Take him straight to Trauma.

464
00:58:20.822 --> 00:58:21.382
Sit down.

465
00:58:22.483 --> 00:58:23.190
Easy.

466
00:59:01.896 --> 00:59:02.643
Hi.

467
00:59:03.944 --> 00:59:05.449
When are the lights going back on?

468
00:59:06.033 --> 00:59:08.646
We're on emergency generators
until the power's restored.

469
00:59:11.330 --> 00:59:12.390
Oh, God.

470
00:59:13.875 --> 00:59:15.309
Oh, I think my water just broke.

471
00:59:16.594 --> 00:59:17.178
Ok.

472
00:59:17.862 --> 00:59:19.038
I'll find a doctor.

473
01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:02.232
Hey.

474
01:00:04.509 --> 01:00:05.943
You two look pretty shaken up.

475
01:00:06.928 --> 01:00:08.530
It hasn't been an easy night for her.

476
01:00:12.433 --> 01:00:13.435
And what about you?

477
01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.513
I'll live.

478
01:00:19.315 --> 01:00:19.941
Ok.

479
01:00:22.401 --> 01:00:23.870
We're leaving in five minutes.

480
01:00:25.655 --> 01:00:26.672
Thank you.

481
01:00:48.636 --> 01:00:49.920
Where is he?

482
01:01:02.550 --> 01:01:03.428
Give me the gun!

483
01:01:04.429 --> 01:01:05.429
Give me the gun!

484
01:01:10.483 --> 01:01:11.402
Come on!

485
01:01:22.169 --> 01:01:23.171
Mommy!

486
01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:28.843
Turn back!
It's a trap!

487
01:01:29.927 --> 01:01:31.645
<i>It's a trap!
It's a trap!</i>

488
01:01:32.429 --> 01:01:33.407
What the fuck?

489
01:01:33.408 --> 01:01:34.489
Go, go, go!

490
01:01:34.573 --> 01:01:37.368
Go! Molly, come on! Run!
Run, Molly!

491
01:01:38.352 --> 01:01:39.195
Oh, God!

492
01:01:40.771 --> 01:01:42.582
Everyone, go! Go!
Out the back!

493
01:01:44.692 --> 01:01:45.652
Fuck this!

494
01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:55.987
<i>Shoot this fucking thing!</i>

495
01:02:05.755 --> 01:02:07.173
Dallas.
What was that thing?

496
01:02:31.822 --> 01:02:32.565
What?

497
01:02:39.830 --> 01:02:41.074
That's not possible.

498
01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:43.974
Shit. Something's wrong.

499
01:02:44.375 --> 01:02:45.736
Check the other rooms.

500
01:02:54.512 --> 01:02:55.563
What is...

501
01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:29.114
Go, baby. Go, go, go.
Keep running.

502
01:03:31.716 --> 01:03:32.734
Straight ahead.
Straight ahead.

503
01:03:34.719 --> 01:03:35.853
What the hell?

504
01:03:37.138 --> 01:03:38.372
This is our help?

505
01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:44.139
What the fuck is going on, Eddie?

506
01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:45.520
Where the hell are the bodies?

507
01:03:45.604 --> 01:03:46.832
They're going to kill us all!

508
01:03:47.133 --> 01:03:48.306
We're not dead yet.

509
01:03:48.691 --> 01:03:50.994
There may be weapons
and equipment we can still use.

510
01:04:00.244 --> 01:04:01.203
Radio.

511
01:04:08.252 --> 01:04:09.479
National Guard, come in.

512
01:04:10.963 --> 01:04:14.057
<i>Repeat, any National Guard unit, come in.</i>

513
01:04:15.926 --> 01:04:18.762
This is Colonel Stevens, US Army.
Identify yourself.

514
01:04:19.346 --> 01:04:21.919
Sheriff Eddie Morales, Gunnison, Colorado.

515
01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:23.567
<i>You have to help us, Colonel.</i>

516
01:04:23.651 --> 01:04:25.311
<i>There's an infestation and</i>

517
01:04:25.312 --> 01:04:28.238
if we don't get help soon,
there won't be any of us left.

518
01:04:28.522 --> 01:04:30.249
What's the army's evacuation plan?

519
01:04:31.634 --> 01:04:32.435
Colonel?

520
01:04:37.031 --> 01:04:39.224
<i>Colonel, we need immediate evac.</i>

521
01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:42.436
<i>Sheriff, all ground routes
have been compromised.</i>

522
01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:45.345
There is an airlift in 30 minutes,

523
01:04:45.446 --> 01:04:46.982
<i>from Gilliam Circle.</i>

524
01:04:47.166 --> 01:04:49.922
Confirm airlift, Gilliam Circle.

525
01:04:49.923 --> 01:04:51.252
We'll be there in 20 minutes.

526
01:04:51.337 --> 01:04:52.963
But that's right in the centre of town.

527
01:04:53.547 --> 01:04:54.807
We'll be there, Colonel.

528
01:05:04.558 --> 01:05:06.168
What the fuck are you?

529
01:05:12.858 --> 01:05:15.299
Everyone, get in the Stryker.

530
01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:16.770
I'll drive.

531
01:05:21.183 --> 01:05:22.644
You sure you can drive that thing?

532
01:05:24.328 --> 01:05:25.309
I'll get on the gun.

533
01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:26.730
Don't miss.

534
01:05:27.414 --> 01:05:28.441
Don't crash.

535
01:05:37.675 --> 01:05:38.817
Hold on.

536
01:07:16.023 --> 01:07:17.204
Why are we stopping?

537
01:07:17.905 --> 01:07:19.284
It doesn't make any sense.

538
01:07:19.568 --> 01:07:22.128
Gilliam Circle is right in the centre of town.

539
01:07:22.613 --> 01:07:24.456
We'll be surrounded by those things.

540
01:07:25.241 --> 01:07:26.434
Wait a second, what he said?

541
01:07:27.035 --> 01:07:28.419
I think the colonel was lying.

542
01:07:29.703 --> 01:07:32.014
That's crazy. The government
doesn't lie to people.

543
01:07:34.208 --> 01:07:36.243
The army thinks about containment first.

544
01:07:36.844 --> 01:07:38.428
They can't risk this getting any worse.

545
01:07:38.512 --> 01:07:41.375
Help is a few miles down that road
and they're waiting for us.

546
01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:43.500
Now if you won't drive us, I will.

547
01:07:43.659 --> 01:07:46.119
Eddie, if she's right, the only thing down
that road are more of those things.

548
01:07:46.203 --> 01:07:47.447
You're not seriously considering this.

549
01:07:47.448 --> 01:07:49.324
I'm considering whatever keeps us alive.

550
01:07:49.473 --> 01:07:51.167
Which means getting out of this town.

551
01:07:52.851 --> 01:07:55.356
There are only two helicopters in town,
but one's at the airport.

552
01:07:55.357 --> 01:07:56.940
No, it's too far.
We'll never make it.

553
01:07:57.081 --> 01:07:58.426
The other one's at the hospital.

554
01:07:58.427 --> 01:08:01.151
The people at the hospital
probably used it to get out.

555
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:02.906
That's a chance we have to take.

556
01:08:03.107 --> 01:08:06.231
If you're wrong and the helicopter's gone,
we're all dead.

557
01:08:06.490 --> 01:08:08.701
If I'm right, they're dead
if they follow you.

558
01:08:15.708 --> 01:08:17.001
There's a truck coming.

559
01:08:22.506 --> 01:08:25.967
<i>There will be an emergency evacuation
from Gilliam Circle.</i>

560
01:08:26.552 --> 01:08:28.403
<i>Medical care will be provided.</i>

561
01:08:28.687 --> 01:08:30.472
Sheriff, what are you doing in there?

562
01:08:30.473 --> 01:08:31.489
Never mind that.

563
01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:33.099
You guys heading to the airlift?
Yeah.

564
01:08:33.610 --> 01:08:35.469
Ok, follow us.
We don't have much time.

565
01:08:36.354 --> 01:08:37.371
Alright, listen up.

566
01:08:37.855 --> 01:08:39.699
Everybody's got to choose, right now.

567
01:08:43.069 --> 01:08:44.309
I'm going to the hospital,

568
01:08:44.410 --> 01:08:45.420
with the tank.

569
01:08:45.604 --> 01:08:47.405
We all need to go to the center of town.

570
01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:49.049
That's right.
I'm going with my brother.

571
01:08:49.233 --> 01:08:50.010
I'm with you.

572
01:08:50.611 --> 01:08:51.643
I'm going in the tank.

573
01:08:52.745 --> 01:08:53.880
Dallas, don't do this.

574
01:08:55.164 --> 01:08:56.231
She's wrong.

575
01:08:56.415 --> 01:08:58.050
And brother or not, he's wrong.

576
01:08:58.334 --> 01:08:59.718
You're gonna get them killed!

577
01:09:00.002 --> 01:09:01.895
We're running out of time,
Sheriff we gotta move now.

578
01:09:02.179 --> 01:09:03.179
Hold on!

579
01:09:03.330 --> 01:09:04.539
We're coming with you!

580
01:09:09.011 --> 01:09:09.787
Wait.

581
01:09:15.893 --> 01:09:16.894
Take care.

582
01:09:19.397 --> 01:09:20.731
I hope we're both wrong.

583
01:09:25.869 --> 01:09:27.479
<i>Medical care and airlift...</i>

584
01:09:30.783 --> 01:09:31.808
Let's go!

585
01:09:31.993 --> 01:09:33.827
<i>There will be an emergency evacuation</i>

586
01:09:33.911 --> 01:09:35.396
<i>from Gilliam Circle.</i>

587
01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:39.082
<i>Medical care and airlift will
be provided for all residents.</i>

588
01:09:52.888 --> 01:09:54.080
I didn't help anybody.

589
01:09:55.449 --> 01:09:56.734
I was too scared.

590
01:09:57.518 --> 01:09:58.961
I just watched them die.

591
01:10:10.906 --> 01:10:12.115
Alright, put these on.

592
01:10:14.818 --> 01:10:15.718
You too.

593
01:10:43.622 --> 01:10:44.498
Alright listen,

594
01:10:44.899 --> 01:10:47.601
whatever happens inside the only person that can't get hurt is Kelly,

595
01:10:47.902 --> 01:10:49.386
alright? We all protect Kelly.

596
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:52.205
What is this, the Titanic?

597
01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:54.157
Screw the women
and children first shit, man.

598
01:10:54.441 --> 01:10:57.367
Look asshole, unless you can fly
the helicopter, shut the fuck up.

599
01:10:57.751 --> 01:10:58.751
Let's go.

600
01:11:36.784 --> 01:11:37.784
Oh, Jesus.

601
01:11:51.049 --> 01:11:52.376
Maybe they've all gone.

602
01:13:34.219 --> 01:13:35.545
Oh, God, no!

603
01:13:37.305 --> 01:13:38.414
Fucking shoot it!

604
01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:46.522
Jesse, no, wait!

605
01:13:46.606 --> 01:13:47.648
Move, now!

606
01:14:53.632 --> 01:14:54.632
Jesse!

607
01:14:55.634 --> 01:14:56.643
No, wait!

608
01:15:12.691 --> 01:15:13.567
Ricky!

609
01:15:26.998 --> 01:15:27.915
Ricky, wait!

610
01:15:27.999 --> 01:15:29.242
Motherfucker!

611
01:15:29.626 --> 01:15:30.626
Ricky!

612
01:15:57.228 --> 01:15:58.028
Come on.

613
01:16:00.532 --> 01:16:01.532
Come on, get up.

614
01:16:02.934 --> 01:16:03.934
You're gonna make it.

615
01:16:09.799 --> 01:16:10.599
We have to go.

616
01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:11.500
Now!

617
01:16:11.701 --> 01:16:12.301
Come on.

618
01:16:12.827 --> 01:16:13.421
Come on!

619
01:16:15.505 --> 01:16:16.731
Go! Go, go, go, go!

620
01:16:29.261 --> 01:16:29.961
Joe!

621
01:16:30.979 --> 01:16:32.279
Is this everybody?

622
01:16:32.764 --> 01:16:33.997
This is all that's left.

623
01:16:34.082 --> 01:16:35.107
What have you heard?

624
01:16:35.191 --> 01:16:36.534
The airlift will be here soon.

625
01:16:41.497 --> 01:16:42.139
Clear!

626
01:16:43.524 --> 01:16:44.216
Come on!

627
01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:46.100
Go, go!
You alright?

628
01:16:50.598 --> 01:16:51.633
Come here, Molly.

629
01:16:54.076 --> 01:16:55.253
Go! Go! Follow your mom!

630
01:16:57.138 --> 01:16:58.138
Come on!

631
01:16:58.214 --> 01:16:59.365
Everyone, move!

632
01:17:01.426 --> 01:17:02.426
Run, Molly!

633
01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:14.529
Come on!

634
01:17:17.032 --> 01:17:18.032
Dallas!

635
01:17:18.193 --> 01:17:19.093
I'm trying!

636
01:17:21.196 --> 01:17:22.946
Are you gonna shoot that thing?

637
01:17:23.031 --> 01:17:24.031
Hang on!

638
01:17:30.038 --> 01:17:31.038
Let's go!

639
01:17:39.038 --> 01:17:40.038
You got her?

640
01:17:51.751 --> 01:17:52.645
Get down!

641
01:17:55.229 --> 01:17:56.130
Colonel Stevens,

642
01:17:56.431 --> 01:17:59.725
this is Gunnison County requesting
status on evac! Over!

643
01:18:06.557 --> 01:18:08.092
Colonel, where's the airlift?

644
01:18:09.476 --> 01:18:11.645
Sheriff, we are ten miles out.

645
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:13.364
Hold your position. Over.

646
01:18:14.849 --> 01:18:16.384
Colonel, we're here. Over.

647
01:18:20.213 --> 01:18:21.214
God help us all.

648
01:18:22.983 --> 01:18:23.984
Alright, get out of here.

649
01:18:24.485 --> 01:18:25.693
Now. I'm gonna buy us some time.

650
01:18:26.177 --> 01:18:27.328
I'm not leaving you.

651
01:18:27.512 --> 01:18:28.662
Get to the chopper!

652
01:18:28.747 --> 01:18:30.114
You don't have to do this, Dallas.

653
01:18:30.798 --> 01:18:32.200
Now! Go! Go!

654
01:18:34.084 --> 01:18:35.285
Come on, you motherfuckers!

655
01:18:41.557 --> 01:18:42.741
Come on, over here!

656
01:18:56.338 --> 01:18:57.038
Come on.

657
01:19:03.746 --> 01:19:04.746
Ok, go!

658
01:19:09.493 --> 01:19:10.202
Fuck!

659
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:13.205
Hey, come on over here!

660
01:19:36.946 --> 01:19:37.946
Come on!

661
01:19:51.627 --> 01:19:52.627
Fuck you!

662
01:20:49.276 --> 01:20:50.735
We're not leaving without Dallas!

663
01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:52.454
We have to go.

664
01:20:52.838 --> 01:20:53.880
He'll make it!

665
01:20:58.985 --> 01:20:59.821
Die!

666
01:21:22.934 --> 01:21:24.010
Let's go!

667
01:23:02.976 --> 01:23:04.052
Mommy?

668
01:24:01.376 --> 01:24:02.777
Close your eyes!

669
01:24:08.217 --> 01:24:10.043
Hang on!
Mommy!

670
01:24:19.061 --> 01:24:20.061
Dallas?

671
01:24:21.563 --> 01:24:22.563
Dallas?

672
01:24:34.408 --> 01:24:35.360
Jesus.

673
01:24:35.544 --> 01:24:37.248
Hey, you alright?

674
01:24:37.649 --> 01:24:38.429
Ricky?

675
01:24:38.613 --> 01:24:39.741
Yeah. Press harder honey.

676
01:25:01.027 --> 01:25:02.253
Drop your weapons!

677
01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:15.100
You bastards killed the entire town.

678
01:25:15.584 --> 01:25:16.843
We're just following orders.

679
01:25:17.527 --> 01:25:18.761
Put down your weapons.

680
01:25:40.883 --> 01:25:42.402
We need a medic, for my brother.

681
01:25:43.686 --> 01:25:44.754
Medevac is inbound.

682
01:25:45.839 --> 01:25:48.333
Secure any weapons
and let's set up a perimeter!

683
01:25:49.318 --> 01:25:50.318
Let's go! Move it!

684
01:26:13.934 --> 01:26:15.235
I thought I told you not to crash.

685
01:26:21.007 --> 01:26:21.708
Mommy?

686
01:26:22.993 --> 01:26:24.411
Are the monsters gone?

687
01:26:26.555 --> 01:26:27.656
They're gone.

688
01:27:20.542 --> 01:27:22.712
The world isn't ready for this technology.

689
01:27:24.896 --> 01:27:27.141
But this isn't for our world,

690
01:27:27.542 --> 01:27:28.684
is it Ms. Yutani?
