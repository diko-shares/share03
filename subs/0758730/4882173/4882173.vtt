Man 2: Gotta wear the hat.

100

Drew, the only reason
you make us wear a hat

101
00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:54.825
is 'cause some manager
made you wear a hat

102

when you were a driver.

103
00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:58.162
Look, the only reason
you got this job

104
00:08:58.246 --> 00:09:00.164
is because your guidance
counselor begged me

105
00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:01.623
to give it to you.

106
00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:03.500

that she's hot

Have Barry do it.

This is not a democracy.

112

113

Yeah, well... you've always
known how to pick 'em, Jess.

154

Well, I'll let you in

I'm getting ready to fire him.

156

00:28:52.171 --> 00:28:53.462
Tell me about this girl.

377
00:28:53.547 --> 00:28:55.673
What girl?

378
00:28:55.757 --> 00:28:57.008
The one you got
your ass kicked over.

379
00:28:57.092 --> 00:28:59.135
It's just a girl.

380
00:28:59.219 --> 00:29:00.386
(Chuckles)

381
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:01.804
No one goes digging around
through shit

382
00:29:01.889 --> 00:29:02.805
over just some girl.

383
00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:05.099
Okay?

384
00:29:08.562 --> 00:29:10.479
What the hell was that?

385
00:29:10.564 --> 00:29:12.106
Relax.
It's just a rat.

386
00:29:12.191 --> 00:29:13.232
It's no fuckin' rat.

387
00:29:15.194 --> 00:29:17.862
All right, check that drain.

388
00:29:26.288 --> 00:29:27.914
(Ominous theme plays)

389
00:29:40.928 --> 00:29:42.678
I got 'em.

390
00:29:42.763 --> 00:29:44.722
(Roaring growl)

391
00:29:48.435 --> 00:29:50.102
Let's go.

392
00:29:53.041 --> 00:29:55.876
Man: Shit, sheriff.
That's buddy's wife.

393
00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.921
Man: Hey, we got some company.

394
00:29:59.005 --> 00:30:00.130
- Darcy.
- Eddie.

395
00:30:00.215 --> 00:30:01.590
I haven't heard anything.

396
00:30:01.674 --> 00:30:04.259
- We're looking for them.
- They could be hurt.

397
00:30:04.344 --> 00:30:06.595
Or they could be on their way home.

398
00:30:06.679 --> 00:30:08.013
Man: You're wasting your time.

399
00:30:08.098 --> 00:30:11.725
Okay, folks, please,
go back and get in your cars.

400
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:13.143
Eddie, my family is out there.

401
00:30:13.228 --> 00:30:16.188
And we're gonna find them.
Let us handle it.

402
00:30:16.272 --> 00:30:18.816
It's too dangerous out there
for you all to search tonight.

403
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.734
Around here, we take care
of our own, sheriff.

404
00:30:20.819 --> 00:30:22.899
We're gonna do the search
whether you like it or not.

405
00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.408
Darcy: Sam?

406
00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:29.868
Sheriff:
Ray, head towards the bridge.

407
00:30:29.953 --> 00:30:33.205
Darcy: Sammy, where are you?!

408
00:30:33.289 --> 00:30:35.749
Sheriff: Buddy?!

409
00:30:35.834 --> 00:30:37.334
Buddy?!

410
00:30:39.379 --> 00:30:42.172
Sam?!

411
00:30:42.257 --> 00:30:45.175
Man: Kelly, bring 'em in!

412
00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.219
Where are you, buddy?

413
00:30:47.303 --> 00:30:50.139
Darcy (Electronically distorted):
Sam? Sam?

414
00:30:50.223 --> 00:30:54.059
Buddy! Buddy!

415
00:30:54.144 --> 00:30:56.395
Sheriff: Buddy!

416
00:30:56.479 --> 00:30:59.440
Darcy: We won't stop
looking for you, Sammy!

417
00:31:02.485 --> 00:31:04.278

(Chatter, indistinct
radio communication)

424
00:31:27.052 --> 00:31:28.052
Eddie?

425
00:31:29.387 --> 00:31:31.555
Darcy, we'll start
up again tomorrow.

426
00:31:33.099 --> 00:31:37.269
My husband and my son
are out here... somewhere.

427
00:31:37.354 --> 00:31:40.397
They wouldn't stop looking for me.

428
00:31:43.318 --> 00:31:45.569
Do you think that...

429
00:31:45.654 --> 00:31:47.404
Something happened?

430
00:31:47.489 --> 00:31:49.114
I don't know.

431
00:31:51.284 --> 00:31:54.078
Why don't you go home
and get some rest?

432
00:31:54.162 --> 00:31:56.205
Come on, we need your strength.

433
00:31:59.459 --> 00:32:00.459
Right.

434
00:32:02.504 --> 00:32:04.421
Man: We're going to regroup
tomorrow in the morning.

435
00:32:04.506 --> 00:32:05.923
We're no good at night here.

436
00:32:06.007 --> 00:32:07.174
Ray, anything?

437
00:32:07.259 --> 00:32:08.342
Ray (Over radio): Negative.

438
00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:10.219
I'm gonna make a final
pass by the Ridge.

439
00:32:10.303 --> 00:32:11.345
All right, keep in touch.

440
00:32:11.429 --> 00:32:12.949
Otherwise, I'll see you
in the morning.

441
00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:23.107

(Slow, ominous theme plays)

453
00:33:43.605 --> 00:33:44.647
Excuse me, sir.

454
00:33:44.731 --> 00:33:46.315
If you've seen my husband
or my son...

455
00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:47.733
- Okay.
- Thank you.

456
00:33:47.817 --> 00:33:48.859
Pardon me.

457
00:33:48.943 --> 00:33:50.110
If I could give you this.

458
00:33:50.195 --> 00:33:51.737
This is my husband and my son.

459
00:33:51.821 --> 00:33:52.821
Just keep an eye.

460
00:33:52.906 --> 00:33:54.698
- Oh, sure.
- Thank you.

461
00:33:54.854 --> 00:33:56.772
Gunnison residents have been jolted

462
00:33:56.856 --> 00:33:59.650
by the mysterious disappearance
of a man and his young son

463
00:33:59.734 --> 00:34:01.777
during a hunting trip yesterday.

464
00:34:01.861 --> 00:34:03.862
Buddy Benson,
a repair supervisor

465
00:34:03.947 --> 00:34:05.155
for the gunnison
telephone company

466
00:34:05.239 --> 00:34:08.158
and his young son, Sam,
never returned home last night.

467
00:34:08.242 --> 00:34:10.202
Molly? Honey, come eat.

468
00:34:11.579 --> 00:34:13.080
How's the job hunt going?

469
00:34:13.164 --> 00:34:16.875
Is breaking and entering
a special skill?

470
00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.086
You got any suggestions?

471
00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:21.713
I hear the bank's hiring.

472
00:34:21.798 --> 00:34:23.674
(Scoffs)

473
00:34:33.059 --> 00:34:35.769
Waitress: Morning, sheriff.

474
00:34:35.853 --> 00:34:37.646
Hey.

475
00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:39.731
Morning.

476
00:34:43.987 --> 00:34:46.571
Any word on buddy and his kid?

477
00:34:46.656 --> 00:34:48.240
Carrie?

478
00:34:48.319 --> 00:34:50.571
Coffee, please.

479
00:34:52.282 --> 00:34:54.408
You guys have been out
all night, huh?

480
00:34:54.492 --> 00:34:56.577
No. We called it off at 2:00 A.M.

481
00:34:59.289 --> 00:35:00.747
Ray didn't come home?

482
00:35:00.832 --> 00:35:02.749
Eddie, I thought
he was out with you.

483
00:35:02.834 --> 00:35:04.626
I tried his cell phone.

484
00:35:04.711 --> 00:35:06.378
Carrie, listen to me.

485
00:35:06.463 --> 00:35:08.046
Ray was pushing
real hard last night.

486
00:35:08.131 --> 00:35:09.423
I'm sure he's still looking.

487
00:35:09.507 --> 00:35:10.799
Cell reception out there...

488
00:35:10.884 --> 00:35:14.344
He always calls, Eddie.

489
00:35:20.518 --> 00:35:22.561
Ray!

490
00:35:27.066 --> 00:35:28.525
Ray?!

491
00:35:30.195 --> 00:35:31.278
(Flies buzzing)

492
00:35:31.362 --> 00:35:32.988
Ray, you down there?

493
00:35:37.285 --> 00:35:38.869
Ray?

494
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:46.376
(Flies buzzing)

495
00:35:56.554 --> 00:35:58.805
(Ominous theme playing)

496
00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:00.557
Oh, my god.

497
00:36:10.151 --> 00:36:13.487
(Flies buzzing loudly)

498
00:36:13.571 --> 00:36:15.697
Coroner:
I can't believe this is ray Adams.

499
00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.747
I don't want to believe it either.

500
00:36:26.251 --> 00:36:29.169
Know what it would take
for a man to do this?

501
00:36:29.254 --> 00:36:32.673
For someone to...
Skin a human being?

502
00:36:32.757 --> 00:36:35.300
There were no tracks.

503
00:36:35.385 --> 00:36:37.886
Nothing.

504
00:36:37.971 --> 00:36:43.684
Eddie, you're in over your head.

505
00:36:43.768 --> 00:36:45.394
What are you going to do?

506
00:36:45.478 --> 00:36:48.855
I'll let you know
when I figure it out.

507
00:37:07.433 --> 00:37:15.433

Hey.

512
00:38:40.443 --> 00:38:41.443
Hey, Jesse.

513
00:38:41.485 --> 00:38:43.695
Hi.

514
00:38:48.409 --> 00:38:50.910
You know, you look at me
that same way in class.

515
00:38:50.995 --> 00:38:53.330
Yeah, well, uh...

516
00:38:53.414 --> 00:38:54.998
The clock's behind you.

517
00:38:55.082 --> 00:38:56.249
What?

518
00:38:56.334 --> 00:38:58.793
Tomorrow when you're
in class, turn around.

519
00:38:58.878 --> 00:38:59.878
You'll see it.

520
00:38:59.962 --> 00:39:01.129
Yeah, I...

521
00:39:01.213 --> 00:39:04.090
I know that it's there, but...

522
00:39:04.175 --> 00:39:07.927
We both know that's not
what you're looking at.

523
00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:13.767
You know, you never
were a good liar.

524
00:39:16.562 --> 00:39:18.188
Do you want to go swimming tonight?

525
00:39:18.272 --> 00:39:19.731
Swimming.

526
00:39:19.815 --> 00:39:21.316
Where?

527
00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.026
At school.

528
00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:26.696
Come on, it'll be like old times.

529
00:39:26.781 --> 00:39:30.116
Old times like before
you had a boyfriend?

530
00:39:30.201 --> 00:39:33.036
Yeah.

531
00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.373
And it's ex-boyfriend, actually.

532
00:39:36.457 --> 00:39:38.625
He's been fired.

533
00:39:40.628 --> 00:39:41.378
So, tonight.

534
00:39:41.462 --> 00:39:44.005
Around 10:00.

535
00:39:48.302 --> 00:39:50.553
See you tonight.

You all right?

If you want to talk...

579
00:43:02.955 --> 00:43:04.623
It's okay.

580

(Conversation continues)

598
00:44:46.559 --> 00:44:49.978
We found Ray's body in the woods.

599
00:44:50.062 --> 00:44:55.108
He was, uh...
He was skinned alive.

600
00:44:58.571 --> 00:45:01.156
Think it's got something
to do with...

601
00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.908
Buddy and his kid disappearing?

602
00:45:03.993 --> 00:45:10.397
I think this kind of thing
doesn't happen here.

603
00:45:12.984 --> 00:45:14.442

You want some help?

609
00:45:24.662 --> 00:45:26.955
I don't know, dallas.

610
00:45:27.039 --> 00:45:28.498
Come on.

611
00:45:28.583 --> 00:45:30.709

631
00:47:03.529 --> 00:47:04.737

(Snarls)

633
00:47:13.205 --> 00:47:14.664
Ricky.

00:47:14.748 --> 00:47:17.458
Hey.

635
00:47:18.502 --> 00:47:21.587
So, uh...

636
00:47:21.672 --> 00:47:24.298
How do we get in?

637
00:47:24.383 --> 00:47:26.342
I taped the lock after class.

638
00:47:26.426 --> 00:47:29.512
(Both chuckle)

639
00:47:32.516 --> 00:47:34.767

(Door closes)

641
00:47:47.889 --> 00:47:50.682
I couldn't decide on which
suit I wanted to wear, so...

642
00:47:57.064 --> 00:48:00.734
Now... you tell me...

643
00:48:02.236 --> 00:48:07.032
Are you looking at me
or the clock?

644
00:48:09.076 --> 00:48:11.161
(Sighs)

645
00:48:11.245 --> 00:48:13.455

651
00:48:36.646 --> 00:48:38.521

you're doing, Jess?

652
00:48:38.606 --> 00:48:40.357
Dale, get out of here.

653
00:48:40.441 --> 00:48:42.484
Just remember, Ricky,

654
00:48:42.568 --> 00:48:44.861

Get off me.

669
00:50:22.585 --> 00:50:23.752
What the hell was that?

670
00:50:25.796 --> 00:50:26.963
Oh, my god.

671
00:50:27.048 --> 00:50:28.465

Do you think he's dead?

681
00:50:46.317 --> 00:50:48.735
Why don't you go back and find out?

682
00:50:49.945 --> 00:50:51.446
No.

683
00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:52.906

have been advised as well.

697
00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:31.444
Wanna tell me what the hell's
goin' on?

698
00:51:31.529 --> 00:51:34.114
There's been an explosion
at the plant.

699
00:51:34.198 --> 00:51:36.074
(Sirens wailing)

700
00:51:36.158 --> 00:51:38.076
Well, this day keeps getting better.

It was outside the window.

708
00:52:05.354 --> 00:52:07.063
What?

709
00:52:07.147 --> 00:52:08.815

00:52:11.318 --> 00:52:13.403
Oh, come here.

(Grunting): Come here.

713
00:52:16.198 --> 00:52:18.574
You know, when I was your age,

714
00:52:18.659 --> 00:52:21.077
I used to have these
awful nightmares.

715
00:52:21.161 --> 00:52:22.578
I saw it.

716
00:52:22.663 --> 00:52:24.038
It was real.

717
00:52:25.999 --> 00:52:28.292

(Tim groaning)

725
00:52:39.513 --> 00:52:40.513
We have to go.

726
00:52:40.597 --> 00:52:42.432
Come on!

727
00:52:42.516 --> 00:52:45.184

(Siren wailing)

735
00:53:41.575 --> 00:53:43.159
Eddie: The fire spread
through the whole plant.

736
00:53:43.243 --> 00:53:45.369
They have to shut down
the reactors manually.

737
00:53:45.454 --> 00:53:47.997
Roger that.

738
00:53:48.081 --> 00:53:51.876
Dispatch, we have
to evacuate the entire town.

739
00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:54.629
Call the national guard in
Colorado Springs for assistance.

740
00:53:54.713 --> 00:53:55.630
Over.

741
00:53:55.714 --> 00:53:56.714

Jesus Christ.

743
00:53:59.301 --> 00:54:00.301
- Sheriff.
- Yeah.

744
00:54:00.344 --> 00:54:01.704
I think you should hear about this.

745
00:54:01.762 --> 00:54:02.762
Dallas!

746
00:54:02.805 --> 00:54:03.721
All right, thanks a lot.

747
00:54:03.806 --> 00:54:05.181

01:04:45.405 --> 01:04:47.989
Are you hurt?

930
01:04:48.074 --> 01:04:50.283
(Panting)

931
01:04:50.368 --> 01:04:51.410
Come on in.

932
01:04:52.412 --> 01:04:54.538
She'll be safe here.

933
01:04:57.875 --> 01:05:00.252
(Over P.A.):
Dr. Lossen to O.R. 2, stat.

934
01:05:00.336 --> 01:05:03.380
- Dr. Lossen to O.R. 2, stat.
- (Whimpering and crying)

935
01:05:04.424 --> 01:05:06.091
Keep pressure on that.

936
01:05:06.175 --> 01:05:08.468
Another liter.

937
01:05:08.553 --> 01:05:10.303
Hold up.

938
01:05:12.181 --> 01:05:13.682
Apparently got a carotid.

939
01:05:13.766 --> 01:05:15.600
Take him straight to trauma.

940
01:05:15.685 --> 01:05:17.352
Easy now.

941
01:05:17.437 --> 01:05:19.479
- (Grunting)
- Here you go.

942
01:05:19.564 --> 01:05:21.773
(Deep growling)

943
01:05:21.858 --> 01:05:24.735
Woman (Over P.A.):
Code yellow, code yellow.

944
01:05:24.819 --> 01:05:27.612
All non-shift medical personnel
report to critical care.

945
01:05:29.657 --> 01:05:37.657
(Babies crying)

946
01:05:38.916 --> 01:05:41.835

(Crying)

949
01:05:51.471 --> 01:05:53.722
(Deep, snarling hiss)

950
01:05:53.806 --> 01:05:56.558
(Crying continues)

951
01:05:56.642 --> 01:05:58.018
Hi.

952
01:05:58.102 --> 01:06:00.520
When are the lights going back on?

953
01:06:00.605 --> 01:06:03.940
We're on emergency generators
until the power's restored.

954
01:06:04.025 --> 01:06:06.359
(Panting)

955
01:06:06.444 --> 01:06:08.111
Oh, god.

956
01:06:08.196 --> 01:06:10.363
Oh, I think my water just broke.

957
01:06:10.448 --> 01:06:12.532
- (Groans)
- Okay.

958
01:06:12.617 --> 01:06:14.159
I'll find a doctor.

959
01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:16.137
(Nurse gasps)

960
01:06:16.222 --> 01:06:19.516
(Snarling)

961
01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:24.979
(Body thuds)

962
01:06:25.064 --> 01:06:26.648
(Gasps)

963
01:06:26.732 --> 01:06:29.943
(Footsteps thudding)

964
01:06:30.027 --> 01:06:31.694
(Monitor beeping rapidly)

965
01:06:31.779 --> 01:06:33.905
(Low snarling)

966
01:06:33.989 --> 01:06:35.990
(Panting)

967
01:06:36.075 --> 01:06:38.743
(Low snarling)

968
01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:50.004
(Screaming)

969
01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:51.339
(Screams)

970
01:06:51.423 --> 01:06:52.674
No!

971
01:06:52.758 --> 01:06:54.259
(Thunder rumbling)

972
01:06:57.722 --> 01:06:59.973
Hey.

973
01:07:00.057 --> 01:07:02.976
You two look pretty shaken up.

974
01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:05.520
Hasn't been an easy night for her.

975
01:07:05.604 --> 01:07:08.314
(Shivering)

976
01:07:08.399 --> 01:07:11.192
And what about you?

977
01:07:12.236 --> 01:07:14.154
I'll live.

978
01:07:14.238 --> 01:07:15.989
(Sniffs)

979
01:07:16.073 --> 01:07:18.742
Okay.

980
01:07:18.826 --> 01:07:21.745
We're leaving in five minutes.

981
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:24.414
Thank you.

982
01:07:26.751 --> 01:07:28.752
(Molly shivering)

983
01:07:32.256 --> 01:07:34.758
(Clattering)

984
01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:39.971
(Creaking)

985
01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:46.603
Where is he?

986
01:07:48.856 --> 01:07:50.273
(Quiet creaking)

987
01:07:50.357 --> 01:07:52.108

988
01:07:52.193 --> 01:07:55.070

989
01:07:55.154 --> 01:07:56.613
(Creaking)

990
01:07:59.158 --> 01:08:02.077
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun!

991
01:08:05.164 --> 01:08:06.331
(Grunts)

992
01:08:07.625 --> 01:08:09.125
Come on!

993
01:08:10.628 --> 01:08:12.378
(Molly screaming)

994
01:08:12.463 --> 01:08:14.798

996
01:08:16.884 --> 01:08:18.968
(Alien screeching)

997
01:08:19.053 --> 01:08:20.428
- Mommy!
- (Acid hissing)

998
01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:21.971
(Panting)

999
01:08:22.056 --> 01:08:24.307
(Low snarling)

1000
01:08:24.391 --> 01:08:26.726
Kelly:
Turn back! It's a trap!

1001
01:08:26.811 --> 01:08:28.728
Kelly (Distorted):
It's a trap! It's a trap!

1002
01:08:28.813 --> 01:08:30.396
- (Jesse gasps)
- What the fuck?

1003
01:08:30.481 --> 01:08:32.065
- Go! Go! Go!
- Kelly: Go!

1004
01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:34.109
Molly, come on, run!
Run, Molly!

1005
01:08:37.446 --> 01:08:39.823
Ricky: Everyone, go, go!
Out the front!

1006
01:08:40.866 --> 01:08:42.325
Fuck this!

1007
01:08:46.330 --> 01:08:47.664
(Roaring)

1008
01:08:49.041 --> 01:08:50.761
- (Predator growls)
- (Dale groans, screams)

1009
01:08:50.835 --> 01:08:53.002
Dale: Shoot the fucking thing!

1010
01:08:54.171 --> 01:08:56.840
(Acid hisses, dale shrieking)

1011
01:08:56.924 --> 01:08:59.425
(Gargled choking)

1012
01:09:01.846 --> 01:09:04.305
- Dallas...
- What was that thing?

1013
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:07.142
(Screeching)

1014
01:09:07.226 --> 01:09:08.601
(Guttural croaking)

1015
01:09:08.686 --> 01:09:11.521
(Screeching, snarling)

1016
01:09:16.235 --> 01:09:17.902
(Roars)

1017
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:22.157
(Predator roars, alien growls)

1018
01:09:22.241 --> 01:09:24.200
(Weapon fires)

1019
01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:25.702
(Computers beeping)

1020
01:09:25.786 --> 01:09:28.788
(Rapid beeping)

1021
01:09:28.873 --> 01:09:31.332
What...?!

1022
01:09:31.417 --> 01:09:36.171
(Various tones sounding,
Al arms beeping)

1023
01:09:36.255 --> 01:09:37.672
That's not possible.

1024
01:09:37.756 --> 01:09:38.673
(Flatline tone)

1025
01:09:38.757 --> 01:09:40.300
Shit.

1026
01:09:40.384 --> 01:09:41.551
Something's wrong.

1027
01:09:41.635 --> 01:09:43.720
Check the other rooms!

1028
01:09:43.804 --> 01:09:46.389
(Flatline tones)

1029
01:09:47.766 --> 01:09:49.475
(Panting)

1030
01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.521
What is...?

1031
01:09:58.277 --> 01:10:01.571
(Gasping, whimpering)

1032
01:10:07.453 --> 01:10:09.036
(Moaning, crying)

1033
01:10:09.121 --> 01:10:10.538
- (Screams)
- (Gasps)

1034
01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:14.125
(Screeching)

1035
01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:16.586
(Low snarling)

1036
01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:24.302
- Come on, yeah...
- Go...

1037
01:10:24.386 --> 01:10:26.471
Darcy: Go, baby, go! Keep running.

1038
01:10:28.933 --> 01:10:31.726
Eddie: Straight ahead.
Straight ahead.

1039
01:10:31.810 --> 01:10:34.520
Darcy: What the hell?

1040
01:10:34.605 --> 01:10:36.064
Dallas: This is our help?!

1041
01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.152
What the fuck is going on, Eddie?!

1042
01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:42.570
Where the hell are the bodies?

1043
01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:43.905
Oh, they're gonna kill us all!

1044
01:10:43.989 --> 01:10:45.657
We're not dead yet.

1045
01:10:45.741 --> 01:10:48.409
There may be weapons
and equipment we can still use.

1046
01:10:57.336 --> 01:10:59.337
Radio.

1047
01:11:03.509 --> 01:11:04.926
(Beeping)

1048
01:11:05.010 --> 01:11:07.387
National guard, come in.

1049
01:11:07.471 --> 01:11:11.391
(Over radio): Repeat-any
national guard unit, come in.

1050
01:11:13.143 --> 01:11:14.936
This is colonel Stevens, U.S. army.

1051
01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:16.312
Identify yourself.

1052
01:11:16.397 --> 01:11:18.064
Sheriff Eddie Morales.

1053
01:11:18.148 --> 01:11:19.315
Gunnison, Colorado.

1054
01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:21.025
You have to help us, colonel.

1055
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:22.610
There's some kind of infestation

1056
01:11:22.695 --> 01:11:25.530
and if we don't get help soon,
there won't be any of us left.

1057
01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:28.700
What's the army's evacuation pl an?

1058
01:11:28.784 --> 01:11:30.868
Colonel?

1059
01:11:34.206 --> 01:11:37.375
Colonel, we need immediate evac.

1060
01:11:37.459 --> 01:11:38.626
(Over radio): Sheriff,
all ground routes

1061
01:11:38.711 --> 01:11:40.086
have been compromised.

1062
01:11:40.170 --> 01:11:42.422
There is an airlift
in 30 minutes

1063
01:11:42.506 --> 01:11:44.215
from Gilliam circle.

1064
01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:47.218
Confirm: Airlift, Gilliam circle.

1065
01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:48.469
We'll be there in 20 minutes.

1066
01:11:48.554 --> 01:11:50.513
But that's right
in the center of town.

1067
01:11:50.597 --> 01:11:53.099
We'll be there, colonel.

1068
01:12:01.775 --> 01:12:04.068
What the fuck are you?

1069
01:12:09.825 --> 01:12:12.493
Kelly: Everyone, get in the striker!

1070
01:12:12.578 --> 01:12:14.996
I'll drive.

1071
01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:17.457
Get up, go, go, go, go.

1072
01:12:18.459 --> 01:12:20.293
You sure you can drive that thing?

1073
01:12:21.545 --> 01:12:23.004
All right, I'll get on the gun.

1074
01:12:23.088 --> 01:12:24.464
Don't miss.

1075
01:12:24.548 --> 01:12:26.632
Don't crash.

1076
01:12:29.428 --> 01:12:32.930
(Engine rumbles)

1077
01:12:34.767 --> 01:12:36.017
Hold on!

1078
01:12:43.942 --> 01:12:46.986
(Hissing)

1079
01:12:56.538 --> 01:12:58.289
(Thunder rumbling)

1080
01:13:08.175 --> 01:13:11.260
(Equipment whirring,
clicking harshly)

1081
01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:15.390
(Guttural croaking)

1082
01:13:19.311 --> 01:13:20.686
(Electrical sizzling)

1083
01:13:27.194 --> 01:13:28.403
(Snarling)

1084
01:13:28.487 --> 01:13:30.071
(Growls)

1085
01:13:30.155 --> 01:13:32.156
(Electronic whirring)

1086
01:13:39.957 --> 01:13:42.291
(Aliens chittering,
screeching in distance)

1087
01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:50.007
(Growling)

1088
01:14:00.018 --> 01:14:03.229
(Ominous theme playing)

1089
01:14:08.986 --> 01:14:10.278
(Anxious sigh)

1090
01:14:13.031 --> 01:14:14.407
Why are we stopping?

1091
01:14:14.491 --> 01:14:16.576
It doesn't make any sense.

1092
01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:19.620
Gilliam circle is right
in the center of town.

1093
01:14:19.705 --> 01:14:22.206
We'll be surrounded by those things.

1094
01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:25.710
- Wait a second-what are you saying?
- I think the colonel was lying.

1095
01:14:25.794 --> 01:14:27.670
That's crazy.

1096
01:14:27.754 --> 01:14:29.338
The government
doesn't lie to people.

1097
01:14:30.549 --> 01:14:33.593
The army thinks about
containment first.

1098
01:14:33.677 --> 01:14:35.720
They can't risk this
getting any worse.

1099
01:14:35.804 --> 01:14:38.973
Help is a few miles down that
road and they're waiting for us.

1100
01:14:39.057 --> 01:14:40.766
Now, if you won't
drive us there, I will.

1101
01:14:40.851 --> 01:14:41.976
Eddie, if she's right,
the only thing

1102
01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:43.311
down that road are
more of those things.

1103
01:14:43.395 --> 01:14:44.604
You're not seriously
considering this.

1104
01:14:44.688 --> 01:14:46.481
I'm considering whatever
keeps us alive.

1105
01:14:46.565 --> 01:14:48.608
Which means
getting out of this town.

1106
01:14:48.692 --> 01:14:51.319
There are only two
helicopters in town,

1107
01:14:51.403 --> 01:14:52.695
but one's at the airport.

1108
01:14:52.779 --> 01:14:53.988
No, it's too far.
We'll never make it.

1109
01:14:54.072 --> 01:14:55.615
The other one's at the hospital.

1110
01:14:55.699 --> 01:14:58.618
