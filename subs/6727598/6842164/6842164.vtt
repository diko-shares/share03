2
00:01:15.324 --> 00:01:17.659
Target acquired
and entering hot zone.

3
00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:19.355
<i>Alpha Team is on standby.</i>

4
00:01:19.357 --> 00:01:20.893
Roger that. Hold position.

5
00:01:22.524 --> 00:01:25.018
Awaiting visual confirmation.

6
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.058
- <i>Is the package on board?</i>
- That's affirmative.

7
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.595
<i>Package is on board.</i>

8
00:01:29.597 --> 00:01:31.870
<i>I repeat, package is on board.</i>

9
00:01:37.276 --> 00:01:39.834
Where are you taking us?
Where are we going?

10
00:01:39.836 --> 00:01:41.339
Please, you
don't have to do this.

11
00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:43.966
You don't understand
how dangerous this is.

12
00:01:59.325 --> 00:02:00.539
I have visual confirmation.

13
00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:02.300
Alpha Team, be ready on my mark.

14
00:02:02.302 --> 00:02:04.062
Waiting for your command.

15
00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:15.003
Target is down.
Execute! Execute! Execute!

16
00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:16.666
Alpha Team is inbound.

17
00:02:16.668 --> 00:02:18.938
Move out! Let's go, brother!

18
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.445
Come from the back!

19
00:02:26.428 --> 00:02:27.677
Let's go!

20
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.068
Why are we stopping?
What's happening?

21
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.702
Shut up! Stay down.

22
00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.517
It's a set-up!

23
00:03:09.693 --> 00:03:10.715
Why are they shooting?
What is happening?

24
00:03:10.717 --> 00:03:12.477
I said stay down!

25
00:03:23.005 --> 00:03:26.042
I'm taking directed fire!
Hurry the hell up!

26
00:03:26.044 --> 00:03:28.604
- Who did you call?
- I didn't call anyone, I swear.

27
00:03:28.606 --> 00:03:30.170
Put your hands up!

28
00:03:42.398 --> 00:03:44.027
Turn on the weapon.

29
00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:46.075
- Now!
- No, you don't understand.

30
00:03:46.077 --> 00:03:47.547
Those men that are
shooting your men outside

31
00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.051
are not gonna let you
turn this on.

32
00:03:49.053 --> 00:03:50.298
You need to stop this now.

33
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.221
Do it! Now.

34
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.022
Do it now! Now!

35
00:04:10.364 --> 00:04:12.446
Now! I said now!

36
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.677
Do it.

37
00:04:18.908 --> 00:04:20.475
Do it now!

38
00:04:20.477 --> 00:04:21.662
Do it.

39
00:04:44.668 --> 00:04:45.597
Uh!

40
00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:49.534
Do it!

41
00:04:53.117 --> 00:04:54.973
I'm not turning this on.
You're gonna have to shoot me.

42
00:04:58.109 --> 00:04:59.451
What are you doing, Kate?
This is crazy.

43
00:04:59.453 --> 00:05:01.211
Just do what he says.

44
00:05:01.213 --> 00:05:03.739
You! Turn it on.

45
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.956
- I-I don't know how.
- Do it!

46
00:05:04.957 --> 00:05:06.524
I've-I've only watched her
run this.

47
00:05:06.526 --> 00:05:07.836
I said, do it now!

48
00:05:07.837 --> 00:05:09.949
- Okay! Okay!
- Do it!

49
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.356
- Don't do this.
- You shut up!

50
00:05:23.484 --> 00:05:25.050
- Don't do this.
- I have to.

51
00:05:25.052 --> 00:05:25.981
Shut up.

52
00:05:27.101 --> 00:05:29.211
- Do it.
- I'm sorry.

53
00:05:29.213 --> 00:05:31.579
Now! Do it!

54
00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.501
I think that's it.

55
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:35.868
What's it doing?

56
00:05:43.453 --> 00:05:45.406
- You don't have to do this.
- Shut up!

57
00:05:48.253 --> 00:05:49.246
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:53.341 --> 00:05:54.654
It's armed.

59
00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:10.781
Ah!

60
00:06:11.804 --> 00:06:13.147
Uh!

61
00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:15.035
Kate! Come on, let's go.

62
00:06:15.037 --> 00:06:16.730
No, I've got to
deactivate this thing.

63
00:06:16.732 --> 00:06:18.683
Let's go. Let's go.

64
00:06:18.685 --> 00:06:20.603
Let's go. We gotta go right now.

65
00:06:20.605 --> 00:06:21.850
It's been activated.
I have to stop it.

66
00:06:21.852 --> 00:06:23.770
No, we have go right now.

67
00:06:23.772 --> 00:06:25.629
No, I have to shut it down.

68
00:06:32.476 --> 00:06:34.332
- What the hell is that thing?
- Ah!

69
00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:37.373
Let's go!

70
00:06:51.836 --> 00:06:54.236
- Ah!
- We gotta go!

71
00:06:59.996 --> 00:07:01.021
Ah!

72
00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:16.283
<i>We're taking heavy fire.</i>

73
00:07:16.285 --> 00:07:18.523
<i>Request evac to this location.</i>

74
00:07:18.525 --> 00:07:21.533
<i>I need all ordnance
on my pod right now.</i>

75
00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:25.949
Go!

76
00:07:42.429 --> 00:07:44.862
Fire for effect.
Fire, fire, fire.

77
00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.362
<i>Direct hit.</i>

78
00:08:08.285 --> 00:08:09.981
All stop, all stop.

79
00:08:21.404 --> 00:08:22.906
This is India Zero Two.

80
00:08:22.908 --> 00:08:24.379
The hostage has been recovered.

81
00:08:24.381 --> 00:08:26.299
We're returning to base
at this time. Over.

82
00:08:26.301 --> 00:08:28.314
<i>Copy that. The weapon?</i>

83
00:08:28.316 --> 00:08:30.202
The weapon's been destroyed.

84
00:08:30.204 --> 00:08:32.378
No, it hasn't.

85
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.236
It's just beginning.

86
00:09:28.124 --> 00:09:31.099
So, professor, what
exactly are you hoping to find?

87
00:09:31.101 --> 00:09:34.522
Anomalies between the two
sets of data would be great.

88
00:09:34.523 --> 00:09:36.378
Comparing readings
from this close to the fault

89
00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.362
with the ones we've collected,
would be invaluable.

90
00:09:38.363 --> 00:09:39.739
Ideally, this is
gonna help us make sense

91
00:09:39.741 --> 00:09:41.658
of all the data we've collected.

92
00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.067
I mean, really anything
that might help

93
00:09:43.069 --> 00:09:44.542
give us some answers, Jake.

94
00:09:48.764 --> 00:09:50.077
Here we are, guys.

95
00:10:07.101 --> 00:10:08.699
Oh!

96
00:10:08.701 --> 00:10:10.331
It's beautiful, huh?

97
00:10:10.333 --> 00:10:12.122
Yeah.

98
00:10:12.124 --> 00:10:15.099
Yeah, not exactly
what I was thinking.

99
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.594
Well, if you were thinking,
then you wouldn't be

100
00:10:17.596 --> 00:10:19.899
spending your spring break
with your father, would you?

101
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.555
How many times
do I have to tell you?

102
00:10:22.557 --> 00:10:24.283
It was a political statement.

103
00:10:24.285 --> 00:10:25.754
Yeah, well,
your political statement

104
00:10:25.756 --> 00:10:27.258
nearly cost me my job

105
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.477
and almost got you expelled.

106
00:10:30.173 --> 00:10:32.026
You know, sometimes
I think you do those things

107
00:10:32.028 --> 00:10:33.468
just to get back
at your mother and I.

108
00:10:36.477 --> 00:10:38.458
Judging from your silence, I'm
gonna take it that I'm right.

109
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.154
I'm an adult.

110
00:10:40.156 --> 00:10:42.523
Yours and Mom's problems
have nothing to do with it.

111
00:10:42.525 --> 00:10:43.837
So don't make it about that.

112
00:10:45.629 --> 00:10:47.929
Okay, Miss Political Statement.

113
00:10:47.931 --> 00:10:49.915
There is a phrase...

114
00:10:49.916 --> 00:10:52.606
"If you can't do the time,
don't do the crime."

115
00:10:54.685 --> 00:10:56.443
Look, it's gonna be
a long couple of days

116
00:10:56.445 --> 00:10:58.075
if you don't start
looking at the bright side.

117
00:10:58.077 --> 00:11:00.826
- There's a bright side?
- Yeah! Uh, I still have a job.

118
00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:03.326
And you still get to
go to school, tuition-free.

119
00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:08.157
Sorry, I didn't mean it
to go that far.

120
00:11:09.725 --> 00:11:10.942
I know.

121
00:11:12.892 --> 00:11:16.093
Hey, professor, which of these
goes inside the ranger station?

122
00:11:18.588 --> 00:11:21.434
And you get to spend time
with that guy.

123
00:11:21.436 --> 00:11:23.258
I don't know, Jake.

124
00:11:23.259 --> 00:11:25.724
How about starting with the ones
labeled "Ranger Station?"

125
00:11:27.997 --> 00:11:29.563
Right.

126
00:11:31.036 --> 00:11:33.435
- Got it!
- Hello!

127
00:11:33.437 --> 00:11:36.027
Is that Mom? Is she back?

128
00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:40.186
You know what, thank
you very much, I'm good.

129
00:11:40.188 --> 00:11:41.593
Bye.

130
00:11:41.595 --> 00:11:43.418
- I guess that wasn't Mom.
- No.

131
00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.986
Somebody trying to sell me
steak knives, so I guess...

132
00:11:44.988 --> 00:11:47.961
You told me she would
be home a week ago.

133
00:11:47.963 --> 00:11:49.339
She's back.

134
00:11:49.341 --> 00:11:53.274
She had some bureaucratic
things to take care of.

135
00:11:53.275 --> 00:11:54.811
What else did she
get herself into?

136
00:11:54.813 --> 00:11:56.570
Rob Harris.

137
00:11:56.572 --> 00:11:58.362
- Hey!
- Heh-heh-hey! Long time.

138
00:11:58.364 --> 00:12:00.793
How are you, Martin?
This is my daughter Jessie.

139
00:12:00.795 --> 00:12:02.810
- Heh-heh-hey.
- Hi!

140
00:12:02.812 --> 00:12:05.149
I've heard a lot about you.
It's good to finally meet.

141
00:12:06.589 --> 00:12:09.402
Wow! She looks like Kate.

142
00:12:09.404 --> 00:12:12.122
- Heh heh. It's a good thing.
- Thanks.

143
00:12:12.123 --> 00:12:15.643
Speaking of, how is Kate?
I haven't seen her in forever.

144
00:12:15.645 --> 00:12:17.213
Yeah, well,
that makes two of us.

145
00:12:20.636 --> 00:12:21.817
I say something wrong?

146
00:12:21.819 --> 00:12:23.738
Just a... It's a touchy subject.

147
00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.819
Oh, the divorce.

148
00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.475
Yeah, anyway, uh, so,
let's talk about this stuff.

149
00:12:28.477 --> 00:12:29.754
What's going on?

150
00:12:29.755 --> 00:12:32.058
I'm sure as heck glad
you're here, Rob.

151
00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.523
If I'm reading that equipment
correctly that you sent me

152
00:12:34.525 --> 00:12:36.091
there's a crazy amount
of seismic activity

153
00:12:36.093 --> 00:12:37.723
all over the fault line.

154
00:12:37.725 --> 00:12:40.122
Looks like a popcorn machine.

155
00:12:40.124 --> 00:12:42.876
I wanna be wrong,
but all this activity is...

156
00:12:44.859 --> 00:12:47.962
- I got a bad feeling.
- That's why I'm here.

157
00:12:47.964 --> 00:12:49.947
Yeah, we picked up the same
readings at university.

158
00:12:49.949 --> 00:12:51.451
Let's get inside
and see what you got.

159
00:12:51.453 --> 00:12:53.374
Sure. Let me help you
with the equipment.

160
00:13:01.213 --> 00:13:04.026
Hey, don't worry
about your mom, okay?

161
00:13:04.028 --> 00:13:07.515
She's gonna be fine.
She always is.

162
00:13:07.517 --> 00:13:09.434
Worrying about her
and wanting to see her

163
00:13:09.436 --> 00:13:10.969
are two separate things.

164
00:13:10.971 --> 00:13:12.765
You seem to forget that.

165
00:13:29.244 --> 00:13:30.841
<i>The hostage has been recovered.</i>

166
00:13:30.843 --> 00:13:32.601
<i>We're returning to base
at this time. Over.</i>

167
00:13:32.603 --> 00:13:35.963
- <i>Copy that. The weapon?</i>
- The weapon's been destroyed.

168
00:13:35.965 --> 00:13:38.457
No, it hasn't.

169
00:13:38.459 --> 00:13:39.676
<i>It's just beginning.</i>

170
00:13:42.333 --> 00:13:44.443
Yes, I see here we've received

171
00:13:44.445 --> 00:13:45.882
numerous phone calls and emails

172
00:13:45.884 --> 00:13:47.803
warning of impending disasters.

173
00:13:47.805 --> 00:13:49.499
Is that what you were doing
over there in Yemen?

174
00:13:49.501 --> 00:13:51.258
Risking your life
and the lives of others

175
00:13:51.259 --> 00:13:54.970
to stop some crazy disaster?

176
00:13:54.972 --> 00:13:57.947
Sir, these crazy disasters
have already begun.

177
00:13:57.949 --> 00:13:59.898
Yes, I've, I've seen that.

178
00:13:59.899 --> 00:14:02.457
Uh, an earthquake in Yemen.

179
00:14:02.459 --> 00:14:04.762
A temblor in Qatar.

180
00:14:04.764 --> 00:14:07.162
Sandstorm in the desert.

181
00:14:07.164 --> 00:14:09.402
A sandstorm in the desert.

182
00:14:09.404 --> 00:14:11.899
Not really an anomaly, is it?

183
00:14:11.901 --> 00:14:13.754
The winds in the sandstorm
you're talking about

184
00:14:13.756 --> 00:14:15.706
were over several hundred
degrees.

185
00:14:15.708 --> 00:14:17.755
What's your intel on that?

186
00:14:17.757 --> 00:14:18.907
That's just the beginning.

187
00:14:18.909 --> 00:14:21.083
Global seismic activity
is up 15 percent

188
00:14:21.085 --> 00:14:22.522
since your team extracted me.

189
00:14:22.524 --> 00:14:24.698
Fifteen percent,
and it's on the rise.

190
00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.266
The Hellstorm
has been initiated...

191
00:14:26.268 --> 00:14:28.378
There is no such thing

192
00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.650
as a Hellstorm weapon.

193
00:14:30.652 --> 00:14:33.437
I am sitting here,
as proof otherwise.

194
00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.277
And this is your proof?

195
00:14:39.003 --> 00:14:40.922
Most of my research
was destroyed in the field.

196
00:14:40.924 --> 00:14:43.097
You are right, in the field.

197
00:14:43.099 --> 00:14:45.562
The field where our men,
good men

198
00:14:45.564 --> 00:14:47.323
apart from saving your life

199
00:14:47.325 --> 00:14:48.794
took out a terrorist
weapon stash

200
00:14:48.796 --> 00:14:50.713
that was confirmed
to contain chemical weapons.

201
00:14:50.715 --> 00:14:52.314
Chemical wea...

202
00:14:52.316 --> 00:14:53.726
Is this a joke?

203
00:14:55.515 --> 00:14:59.386
Miss, uh, doomsday scenarios are
nothing new to this office.

204
00:14:59.388 --> 00:15:01.115
Russia's getting squirrely
with her nukes.

205
00:15:01.117 --> 00:15:03.387
ISIS may or may not be
acquiring a dirty bomb.

206
00:15:03.389 --> 00:15:04.987
North Korea...

207
00:15:04.989 --> 00:15:06.714
Well, forget about North Korea.

208
00:15:06.716 --> 00:15:08.953
But your scenario...

209
00:15:08.955 --> 00:15:11.610
Let's just call it what it is,
it's fantasy.

210
00:15:11.612 --> 00:15:15.163
Hellstorm weapons,
resonance weapons.

211
00:15:15.165 --> 00:15:19.161
This isn't fantasy, it's fact.
I have seen it.

212
00:15:19.163 --> 00:15:22.587
Yes, I've read your report,
I think we all have.

213
00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:25.274
Resonance as a weapon
is just a theory.

214
00:15:25.276 --> 00:15:28.122
Enough to know the difference
between fact and theory.

215
00:15:28.123 --> 00:15:30.107
We don't give credit
to outlandish theories

216
00:15:30.109 --> 00:15:32.858
here in this office. If we did,
we would have shut down

217
00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.322
for the 2012 Mayan apocalypse.

218
00:15:35.324 --> 00:15:38.425
GMOs would have turned
all of us into zombies by now.

219
00:15:38.427 --> 00:15:41.402
I'd even turn off
my laptop for Y2K.

220
00:15:41.404 --> 00:15:43.418
The point is, whatever was
in that desert was destroyed.

221
00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.337
It isn't destroyed!
It's activated!

222
00:15:45.339 --> 00:15:48.762
The only thing your bombs did
was make it harder to turn off!

223
00:15:48.764 --> 00:15:51.257
There are some very smart men
in the middle of that desert

224
00:15:51.259 --> 00:15:53.273
who have figured out a
technology that makes it capable

225
00:15:53.275 --> 00:15:55.066
of wiping out an entire village.

226
00:15:55.068 --> 00:15:57.818
So I would gratefully appreciate
this office's help...

227
00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.737
Whatever you think

228
00:15:59.739 --> 00:16:01.434
was or was not in that desert

229
00:16:01.436 --> 00:16:02.938
was taken out by a team of men

230
00:16:02.939 --> 00:16:04.633
who also risked their lives

231
00:16:04.635 --> 00:16:05.981
to save yours.

232
00:16:06.556 --> 00:16:08.026
So...

233
00:16:08.028 --> 00:16:10.393
what we'd appreciate from you

234
00:16:10.395 --> 00:16:12.252
is a little bit of gratitude.

235
00:16:14.077 --> 00:16:17.755
- This meeting's over.
- Uh, over?

236
00:16:17.757 --> 00:16:20.669
- Why am I here?
- I said, this meeting is over.

237
00:16:23.836 --> 00:16:26.299
This meeting might be over,
but mark my words

238
00:16:26.301 --> 00:16:28.797
this... this has just begun.

239
00:16:36.988 --> 00:16:39.642
Where are the
seats for the tent?

240
00:16:39.644 --> 00:16:41.754
Babe, uh, where's my toolbox?

241
00:16:41.756 --> 00:16:44.153
I don't know. I
thought you packed it.

242
00:16:44.155 --> 00:16:45.626
I told you to pack it.

243
00:16:45.628 --> 00:16:47.930
Why would I pack your toolbox?

244
00:16:47.932 --> 00:16:49.530
Because I asked you to.

245
00:16:49.532 --> 00:16:50.746
Yes, and I told you I couldn't

246
00:16:50.748 --> 00:16:52.604
because I had to pack
the groceries.

247
00:16:54.107 --> 00:16:56.121
So you didn't pack it?

248
00:16:56.123 --> 00:16:57.980
I packed the groceries.

249
00:17:01.435 --> 00:17:03.866
Seriously,
do you ever listen to me?

250
00:17:03.868 --> 00:17:05.177
Clearly not, 'cause if you did

251
00:17:05.179 --> 00:17:07.100
you'd have a toolbox,
wouldn't ya?

252
00:17:20.061 --> 00:17:21.244
Oh!

253
00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.786
Oh, my God, babe!
Are you seeing this?

254
00:17:28.796 --> 00:17:30.716
Run! Run!

255
00:17:31.611 --> 00:17:32.987
Oh!

256
00:17:32.989 --> 00:17:35.421
Oh! Oh, no!

257
00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.893
Rob, you're gonna wanna
see this.

258
00:17:48.348 --> 00:17:49.724
That's the second one today.

259
00:17:50.748 --> 00:17:52.858
Southridge.

260
00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.226
Not really an alarming size,
it's barely registering.

261
00:17:55.228 --> 00:17:57.817
No, but it-it's not the size
that's of concern

262
00:17:57.819 --> 00:17:59.577
it's the frequency.
Have you been mapping these?

263
00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:02.234
Yeah, every single one of 'em,
like you told me to.

264
00:18:02.235 --> 00:18:04.249
See, it's not the size.

265
00:18:04.251 --> 00:18:06.491
Would you grow up?

266
00:18:06.493 --> 00:18:08.442
Yeah, the, uh,
pins are tagged with size

267
00:18:08.444 --> 00:18:10.393
duration and time.

268
00:18:10.395 --> 00:18:12.890
So, what's
that supposed to mean?

269
00:18:12.892 --> 00:18:14.874
Is California getting ready
for the big one?

270
00:18:14.876 --> 00:18:16.091
Well, it shouldn't be.

271
00:18:16.093 --> 00:18:17.625
See, normally,
this kind of activity

272
00:18:17.627 --> 00:18:19.067
would be a good thing to release

273
00:18:19.068 --> 00:18:20.218
the stress along
the fault line, but...

274
00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:21.530
But then the seismic activity

275
00:18:21.532 --> 00:18:23.322
would be decelerating, right?

276
00:18:23.324 --> 00:18:26.394
Exactly, but here
it's accelerating.

277
00:18:26.396 --> 00:18:28.281
You've been paying attention.

278
00:18:28.283 --> 00:18:30.106
What is that?

279
00:18:30.108 --> 00:18:31.356
- Another one.
- Something's coming in.

280
00:18:39.388 --> 00:18:41.692
Okay, professor,
that didn't feel small.

281
00:18:42.908 --> 00:18:45.049
No, it didn't.

282
00:18:46.556 --> 00:18:49.594
Ranger Station 219,
go for Martin.

283
00:18:52.477 --> 00:18:53.981
Alright, copy that.

284
00:18:56.925 --> 00:19:00.154
I got an emergency.
You should come with me.

285
00:19:00.156 --> 00:19:02.329
Okay. Uh...

286
00:19:02.331 --> 00:19:04.732
You guys stay here
and finish set up the equipment.

287
00:19:06.908 --> 00:19:08.601
Stay here?

288
00:19:10.109 --> 00:19:11.449
It's just a tremor.

289
00:19:11.451 --> 00:19:12.924
We should be fine.

290
00:19:50.364 --> 00:19:51.709
Can we talk?

291
00:19:55.804 --> 00:19:56.921
I can't believe you were there.

292
00:19:56.923 --> 00:19:58.425
I can't believe
you went to Yemen.

293
00:19:58.427 --> 00:20:00.506
- Who are you?
- I mean, you saw it, right?

294
00:20:00.508 --> 00:20:04.345
You saw the weapon.
Was it, was it operational?

295
00:20:04.347 --> 00:20:06.777
Sorry, my parents always
said that I was very short on tact.

296
00:20:06.779 --> 00:20:08.410
- Drew. Drew Slack.
- Wait.

297
00:20:08.412 --> 00:20:10.843
What do you know? Why didn't you
say anything in there?

298
00:20:10.845 --> 00:20:13.211
- Off the record?
- Not a reporter.

299
00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:15.258
- Your car's not bugged, is it?
- What?

300
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.242
Okay.

301
00:20:17.244 --> 00:20:19.133
I was part of the crew
that hacked the files.

302
00:20:20.121 --> 00:20:22.138
We dumped the info out there,
th-the files that you got.

303
00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.801
- Files that sent you to Yemen.
- No. Wait! Slow down.

304
00:20:23.803 --> 00:20:25.434
That was you?

305
00:20:25.435 --> 00:20:27.610
Well, me and some anonymous
friends.

306
00:20:27.612 --> 00:20:29.305
- That's treason.
- Uh, okay...

307
00:20:29.307 --> 00:20:31.545
I'm acutely aware of that,
but I don't see it that way.

308
00:20:31.547 --> 00:20:33.049
See, okay,
because if you're right

309
00:20:33.051 --> 00:20:34.201
which I think that you are

310
00:20:34.203 --> 00:20:35.322
then it's the men in those rooms

311
00:20:35.324 --> 00:20:36.507
that are the real
treasonous ones.

312
00:20:36.509 --> 00:20:39.673
Okay, they know, Kate.
Keegan, Pierce.

313
00:20:39.675 --> 00:20:41.625
They know that Hellstorm exists.

314
00:20:41.627 --> 00:20:44.153
- They're lying to you.
- Why, why lie?

315
00:20:44.155 --> 00:20:45.498
Because it's their technology

316
00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.681
that got stolen
in the first place.

317
00:20:46.683 --> 00:20:47.866
Sensitive
government information.

318
00:20:47.868 --> 00:20:50.681
How do you think
that's gonna look?

319
00:20:50.683 --> 00:20:52.762
Thing is, they're confident
they destroyed it.

320
00:20:52.764 --> 00:20:54.618
Yeah, well, they're wrong,
we've got to get back in there.

321
00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:56.442
Wait, wait, are you kidding me?
You can't go back in there.

322
00:20:56.444 --> 00:20:57.978
They'll have you locked up
before you can say anything.

323
00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:00.089
- Or worse.
- Worse?

324
00:21:00.091 --> 00:21:02.010
This division of government
doesn't exactly answer

325
00:21:02.012 --> 00:21:04.985
to a whole of people,
if you get what I'm saying.

326
00:21:04.987 --> 00:21:06.201
Okay.

327
00:21:06.203 --> 00:21:08.794
How sure are you
that it's operational?

328
00:21:08.796 --> 00:21:10.009
I was there.

329
00:21:10.011 --> 00:21:11.865
I saw it. It is.

330
00:21:11.867 --> 00:21:13.913
This is so bad.

331
00:21:13.915 --> 00:21:15.737
Oh, this is so bad.

332
00:21:15.739 --> 00:21:18.042
Okay, Drew, listen.

333
00:21:18.044 --> 00:21:20.474
I need your help.
I have to get out of here.

334
00:21:20.476 --> 00:21:23.386
But I need you to get my files.
They have them.

335
00:21:23.388 --> 00:21:25.306
I need them.

336
00:21:25.308 --> 00:21:27.354
You can do this,
go get me my files.

337
00:21:27.356 --> 00:21:28.954
I'm going to jail,
I'm definitely going to jail.

338
00:21:28.956 --> 00:21:30.746
You're gonna be a hero.

339
00:21:30.748 --> 00:21:32.666
Nelson Mandela was a hero, and
he went to jail for 27 years.

340
00:21:32.668 --> 00:21:33.946
Drew, thousands
of innocent people

341
00:21:33.948 --> 00:21:36.441
are going to lose
their lives, maybe more.

342
00:21:36.443 --> 00:21:37.435
Oh!

343
00:21:43.515 --> 00:21:44.444
Fine.

344
00:21:46.171 --> 00:21:48.026
I'll do it.

345
00:21:48.028 --> 00:21:50.297
- Where are you going?
- San Andreas Fault.

346
00:21:50.299 --> 00:21:52.186
Is there a problem there, too?

347
00:21:52.188 --> 00:21:53.721
There's gonna be
a problem everywhere.

348
00:21:53.723 --> 00:21:55.579
Go get me the info.

349
00:21:56.219 --> 00:21:57.851
Got it.

350
00:22:02.843 --> 00:22:04.509
Come on, Rob.

351
00:22:35.324 --> 00:22:37.245
Oh, Rob, this
does not look good.

352
00:22:39.228 --> 00:22:41.084
Man, what happened here?

353
00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.701
What is this?

354
00:22:56.347 --> 00:22:57.820
Oh, no.

355
00:23:01.979 --> 00:23:03.866
I knew these people.

356
00:23:03.868 --> 00:23:04.857
Uh...

357
00:23:06.972 --> 00:23:08.413
Look at that.

358
00:23:20.668 --> 00:23:21.980
Go!

359
00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.251
Let's go!

360
00:23:30.843 --> 00:23:31.773
Go!

361
00:23:45.563 --> 00:23:49.305
Look. It looks like there was
another seismic event.

362
00:23:49.307 --> 00:23:51.994
You know how to read that?

363
00:23:51.996 --> 00:23:53.913
You do know who
my parents are, right?

364
00:23:53.915 --> 00:23:55.545
Yeah, so, why this
sudden interest

365
00:23:55.547 --> 00:23:56.794
in what your father's doing?

366
00:23:56.796 --> 00:23:58.394
Thought you were
going on spring break.

367
00:23:58.396 --> 00:23:59.738
I was.

368
00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.425
I got in trouble
for a little political stunt.

369
00:24:02.427 --> 00:24:04.729
This is my punishment.

370
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.330
I guess there was
a lot of that going on.

371
00:24:06.332 --> 00:24:08.953
I heard that there was this
group of people

372
00:24:08.955 --> 00:24:10.842
who painted themselves green

373
00:24:10.844 --> 00:24:12.313
and went streaking across campus

374
00:24:12.315 --> 00:24:14.714
to raise awareness
for Earth Day.

375
00:24:14.716 --> 00:24:15.961
Thought that was kinda cool.

376
00:24:15.963 --> 00:24:18.653
Thanks. My father
didn't think so.

377
00:24:20.187 --> 00:24:23.034
Wait, that was you?

378
00:24:23.036 --> 00:24:26.714
Where am I at when all
the cool stuff happens? Damn!

379
00:24:26.716 --> 00:24:28.569
- Jake, it was for a cause.
- Well, no, I get that.

380
00:24:28.571 --> 00:24:30.234
And I support it, like,
like wholly.

381
00:24:30.236 --> 00:24:32.377
Like next time you do it,
any time you want to do it

382
00:24:32.379 --> 00:24:33.657
you just, you let me know

383
00:24:33.659 --> 00:24:35.962
and I'll be there, you know,
f-for the cause.

384
00:24:35.964 --> 00:24:38.810
- Jake...
- With a paint brush and paint.

385
00:24:38.812 --> 00:24:41.145
Jake, you remember
when we were in the car

386
00:24:41.147 --> 00:24:42.682
and you told me to tell you
when you were

387
00:24:42.684 --> 00:24:43.929
being awkward and uncomfortable?

388
00:24:43.931 --> 00:24:44.988
Yeah.

389
00:24:46.908 --> 00:24:48.441
I'm doing it right now,
aren't I?

390
00:24:48.443 --> 00:24:49.945
Yeah, you're doing it right now.

391
00:24:49.947 --> 00:24:51.449
I'm sorry. I just...

392
00:24:51.451 --> 00:24:53.308
I get nervous
when I'm around you.

393
00:24:55.739 --> 00:24:57.244
Whatever. Ahem.

394
00:24:59.547 --> 00:25:02.652
- We have internet.
- Oh, perfect.

395
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:12.668
What? What? What?

396
00:25:13.948 --> 00:25:16.186
<i>Again, what we are seeing</i>

397
00:25:16.188 --> 00:25:18.234
<i>is widespread destruction</i>

398
00:25:18.236 --> 00:25:19.514
<i>that has consumed Paris.</i>

399
00:25:19.515 --> 00:25:21.305
Oh, my God.

400
00:25:21.307 --> 00:25:23.194
<i>Reports are coming in
from all...</i>

401
00:25:23.196 --> 00:25:25.178
Is that the Eiffel Tower?

402
00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:27.933
<i>...describing
huge earthquakes followed...</i>

403
00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.124
Rob?

404
00:25:47.035 --> 00:25:49.849
Jess?

405
00:25:49.851 --> 00:25:52.794
<i>Massive storms
that have toppled...</i>

406
00:25:52.796 --> 00:25:55.900
Mom! Where have you been?

407
00:25:57.723 --> 00:25:59.546
<i>Survivors have described</i>

408
00:25:59.548 --> 00:26:01.849
<i>a scene right out of hell</i>

409
00:26:01.851 --> 00:26:04.121
<i>with smoke, ash, and debris</i>

410
00:26:04.123 --> 00:26:06.556
<i>raining down
over the entire city.</i>

411
00:26:27.516 --> 00:26:29.661
- Gotta get out of this park.
- I agree.

412
00:26:33.179 --> 00:26:34.905
Change of plans, guys.
Pack up your stuff.

413
00:26:34.907 --> 00:26:36.473
We're leaving.

414
00:26:36.475 --> 00:26:38.746
Kate, when'd you get here?

415
00:26:38.748 --> 00:26:40.666
<i>...definitely being
described as a natural disaster.</i>

416
00:26:40.668 --> 00:26:42.168
What are you guys looking at?

417
00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:45.529
<i>We can only assume
at this point</i>

418
00:26:45.531 --> 00:26:48.730
<i>that so many
innocent people are dead.</i>

419
00:26:48.732 --> 00:26:51.641
<i>And the damage
is in the billions</i>

420
00:26:51.643 --> 00:26:53.401
<i>if not more.</i>

421
00:26:53.403 --> 00:26:57.209
<i>Emergency crews are pouring
through the rubble</i>

422
00:26:57.211 --> 00:27:00.281
<i>as scores of buildings
lay in ruins</i>

423
00:27:00.283 --> 00:27:02.970
<i>in the center of
one of the greatest cities</i>

424
00:27:02.972 --> 00:27:04.346
<i>in the world</i>

425
00:27:04.348 --> 00:27:06.906
<i>reeling now from the effects</i>

426
00:27:06.908 --> 00:27:08.413
<i>of this catastrophe.</i>

427
00:27:14.587 --> 00:27:15.737
Don't take your eyes
off the screen.

428
00:27:15.739 --> 00:27:17.660
Let me know
if anything changes.

429
00:27:25.244 --> 00:27:26.301
What time did these readings
come in?

430
00:27:30.683 --> 00:27:32.696
There's a major
at the front desk.

431
00:27:32.698 --> 00:27:33.788
Right.

432
00:28:35.227 --> 00:28:36.954
- Hello?
- <i>Penny, it's Drew.</i>

433
00:28:36.956 --> 00:28:39.066
- Do you have a second?
- Are you watching the news?

434
00:28:39.068 --> 00:28:40.986
Did you see
what happened in France?

435
00:28:40.988 --> 00:28:43.193
Do you know where I work?
Of course I know.

436
00:28:43.194 --> 00:28:45.018
Why are you whispering?

437
00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:46.842
Because I just told you
where I am.

438
00:28:46.844 --> 00:28:48.985
And this call
isn't exactly legal.

439
00:28:48.987 --> 00:28:51.610
Dude! You are in
a government building.

440
00:28:51.612 --> 00:28:54.138
Go somewhere else.

441
00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:56.409
I can't. I can't. I don't have
time to explain it.

442
00:28:56.411 --> 00:28:57.820
<i>Just need you to listen
to me, okay?</i>

443
00:29:04.635 --> 00:29:05.788
Oh, shh.

444
00:29:10.843 --> 00:29:12.508
Are you in a bathroom?

445
00:29:18.076 --> 00:29:19.195
Ohh.

446
00:29:24.219 --> 00:29:26.106
Oh, my God.

447
00:29:30.043 --> 00:29:31.257
Oh.

448
00:29:33.404 --> 00:29:35.675
- Agh.
- Go.

449
00:29:40.124 --> 00:29:41.562
Oh, sorry.

450
00:29:49.786 --> 00:29:51.705
Okay.

451
00:29:51.707 --> 00:29:52.889
Sorry about that.

452
00:29:52.891 --> 00:29:55.481
Okay, long story short.

453
00:29:55.483 --> 00:29:58.042
I need to get to the server
room, and I can't get access

454
00:29:58.044 --> 00:30:00.792
unless there's
a critical network failure.

455
00:30:00.794 --> 00:30:02.299
Okay.

456
00:30:03.771 --> 00:30:05.496
I need a zip bomb.

457
00:30:05.498 --> 00:30:09.369
- Are you kidding me?
- <i>No. I'm not kidding, okay?</i>

458
00:30:09.371 --> 00:30:11.545
I need a data dump so massive
that it clogs the servers

459
00:30:11.547 --> 00:30:12.761
and shuts everything down.

460
00:30:14.138 --> 00:30:15.833
Come on.

461
00:30:15.835 --> 00:30:17.017
<i>They're monitoring
our activities</i>

462
00:30:17.019 --> 00:30:18.940
<i>so I can't do it here.</i>

463
00:30:19.994 --> 00:30:22.427
Penny? Are you there?

464
00:30:23.708 --> 00:30:24.922
<i>Penny?</i>

465
00:30:24.924 --> 00:30:26.906
Is this treason?

466
00:30:26.908 --> 00:30:29.401
No, why does everybody
keep saying that?

467
00:30:29.403 --> 00:30:30.586
'Cause it is.

468
00:30:30.588 --> 00:30:32.249
Okay, no, it's not...

469
00:30:32.251 --> 00:30:33.592
Technically, it is.

470
00:30:33.594 --> 00:30:36.185
But it's...

471
00:30:36.187 --> 00:30:37.785
<i>It's for a good cause,
I'm telling you.</i>

472
00:30:37.787 --> 00:30:40.056
What happened in France
is not over.

473
00:30:40.058 --> 00:30:42.777
Okay, if, if you, if, if you
just do me this one solid

474
00:30:42.779 --> 00:30:44.601
I'll give you whatever you want.

475
00:30:44.603 --> 00:30:45.789
Please?

476
00:30:48.284 --> 00:30:49.626
Okay, but you owe me.

477
00:30:49.628 --> 00:30:51.449
Yes!

478
00:30:51.451 --> 00:30:53.144
I'll text you when it's ready.

479
00:30:53.146 --> 00:30:55.065
<i>Okay.</i>

480
00:30:55.067 --> 00:30:57.050
What do you mean it's not over?

481
00:30:57.052 --> 00:30:58.905
I don't have time to explain.
Um, I love you, bye.

482
00:30:58.907 --> 00:31:00.189
What? You love me?

483
00:31:01.723 --> 00:31:04.152
Did I just say that?

484
00:31:04.154 --> 00:31:05.849
No, the entire park.

485
00:31:05.851 --> 00:31:07.225
We need to close off
to the public.

486
00:31:07.227 --> 00:31:09.434
Anyone still inside,
we need evacuated.

487
00:31:09.436 --> 00:31:11.833
- <i>Why everyone?</i>
- Because it's not safe.

488
00:31:11.835 --> 00:31:13.530
Not just the main entrance,
all the entrances.

489
00:31:13.532 --> 00:31:15.736
So one minute I think
you're teaching in France

490
00:31:15.738 --> 00:31:18.074
and then next, I find out
that you're kidnapped.

491
00:31:18.076 --> 00:31:19.706
In Yemen. By militants.

492
00:31:19.708 --> 00:31:22.200
I was in France,
and I found out about these

493
00:31:22.202 --> 00:31:24.089
leaked government files, and
I had to go see if it was real.

494
00:31:24.091 --> 00:31:26.840
- This is a global threat.
- Hey, that's not your job, okay?

495
00:31:26.842 --> 00:31:29.081
Who-who do you think you...
You think you're James Bond?

496
00:31:29.082 --> 00:31:30.073
Do you have any other
explanation

497
00:31:30.075 --> 00:31:31.033
for what's going on right now?

498
00:31:31.035 --> 00:31:32.825
Hey, you know,
maybe I don't, maybe I don't.

499
00:31:32.827 --> 00:31:34.906
Maybe I'm just sitting
at a university

500
00:31:34.908 --> 00:31:36.857
trying to raise our daughter,
while you're running around

501
00:31:36.859 --> 00:31:38.361
risking your life
for God knows what.

502
00:31:38.363 --> 00:31:40.218
Don't.

503
00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.264
Don't do that right now.

504
00:31:43.514 --> 00:31:45.561
Now, the Hellstorm weapon is,
is real.

505
00:31:45.563 --> 00:31:46.969
Hellstorm?

506
00:31:46.971 --> 00:31:49.273
I thought we were
leaving the park.

507
00:31:49.275 --> 00:31:50.905
Hellstorm weapon
is a myth, Kate.

508
00:31:50.907 --> 00:31:53.017
Well, now you just sound
like the Department of Defense.

509
00:31:53.019 --> 00:31:54.841
Department of Defense? When were
you at Department of Defense?

510
00:31:54.843 --> 00:31:56.025
They pulled me out of Yemen.

511
00:31:56.027 --> 00:31:57.561
Hey, but now you know
the whole story

512
00:31:57.563 --> 00:31:58.842
so we don't have to go to
couple's therapy.

513
00:31:58.843 --> 00:32:01.529
So you're gonna make
a joke out of this? Huh?

514
00:32:01.531 --> 00:32:03.354
A fully operational
resonance weapon

515
00:32:03.356 --> 00:32:04.826
is burrowing its way
into the earth's crust

516
00:32:04.828 --> 00:32:06.296
and destabilizing
the lithosphere.

517
00:32:06.298 --> 00:32:08.089
Those readings that you sent
to me from here

518
00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:10.010
they're happening everywhere,
but especially on fault lines

519
00:32:10.011 --> 00:32:12.473
like the San Andreas that we are
literally standing on right now.

520
00:32:12.475 --> 00:32:13.849
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

521
00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:15.033
Yes, I know what you're saying.

522
00:32:15.035 --> 00:32:16.920
I don't.

523
00:32:16.922 --> 00:32:18.556
What's a resonance weapon?

524
00:32:20.155 --> 00:32:22.554
- You just heard all that?
- Yep.

525
00:32:22.556 --> 00:32:24.634
And including the part where
my mother has been seriously

526
00:32:24.636 --> 00:32:26.845
kidnapped in Yemen and we have
no idea where you are.

527
00:32:33.467 --> 00:32:35.323
Kate, you were kidnapped?

528
00:32:55.386 --> 00:32:56.632
So, what's this all about

529
00:32:56.634 --> 00:32:58.842
'cause you're kinda
freaking me out.

530
00:32:58.844 --> 00:33:00.505
You're kidding me?
We can't talk about this here.

531
00:33:00.507 --> 00:33:02.232
The cameras have cameras.

532
00:33:02.234 --> 00:33:05.208
I feel like Gene Hackman
in "Enemy Of The State."

533
00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:07.192
Does any of this have
to do with the dump?

534
00:33:07.194 --> 00:33:08.856
Are we gonna get caught?

535
00:33:08.858 --> 00:33:12.474
This is bad, Penny.
Like people are going to die.

536
00:33:12.476 --> 00:33:13.848
Like, they may already have.

537
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:14.906
France?

538
00:33:14.908 --> 00:33:17.560
France, India.

539
00:33:17.562 --> 00:33:20.249
Now, it makes sense
that you said you loved me.

540
00:33:20.251 --> 00:33:22.073
What? No, that was more
of like a moment

541
00:33:22.075 --> 00:33:24.153
of severe stress
and anxiety more than anything.

542
00:33:24.155 --> 00:33:25.881
I didn't really, you know,
mean anything by it.

543
00:33:25.883 --> 00:33:27.897
Oh, too bad.

544
00:33:27.899 --> 00:33:29.880
Too bad? What do you mean
too bad? Too bad?

545
00:33:29.882 --> 00:33:32.729
Nothing.

546
00:33:32.731 --> 00:33:34.906
But hey,
you brought me soup to work.

547
00:33:34.908 --> 00:33:36.955
We're like an old
married couple, right?

548
00:33:39.579 --> 00:33:40.795
Oh, God.

549
00:33:54.555 --> 00:33:55.644
Right.

550
00:34:02.395 --> 00:34:04.155
It's the same stuff
every time, come on.

551
00:34:04.731 --> 00:34:06.713
What's this?

552
00:34:06.715 --> 00:34:09.019
It's, uh... It's soup.

553
00:34:11.067 --> 00:34:12.921
What? We can't bring in
soup anymore?

554
00:34:12.923 --> 00:34:14.457
Come on, my girlfriend
brought it for me.

555
00:34:14.459 --> 00:34:17.145
I've been working through lunch.
Burning the candle at both ends.

556
00:34:17.147 --> 00:34:18.649
You know how it goes.

557
00:34:18.651 --> 00:34:20.473
I think it's made of basil.

558
00:34:20.475 --> 00:34:24.857
You smell the basil? Think
it's, like, in there somewhere?

559
00:34:24.859 --> 00:34:26.650
Okay, I'll tell you what, if I
don't finish the whole thing

560
00:34:26.652 --> 00:34:28.313
I'll come back and I'll give you
the rest of it.

561
00:34:28.315 --> 00:34:30.075
Yeah? I'm good?

562
00:34:31.451 --> 00:34:32.891
Great. Thanks, Hughes.

563
00:34:47.483 --> 00:34:49.337
Loading, unloading.

564
00:34:49.339 --> 00:34:51.545
I swear I'm having déjà vu.

565
00:34:51.547 --> 00:34:53.020
Who cares?

566
00:34:55.547 --> 00:34:58.330
Must've been tough to listen to.

567
00:34:58.332 --> 00:35:00.409
Between your parents and all?

568
00:35:00.411 --> 00:35:03.161
It's not exactly
"The Brady Bunch."

569
00:35:03.163 --> 00:35:04.921
Did you really not know
where your mom was?

570
00:35:04.923 --> 00:35:06.874
Apparently not.

571
00:35:06.876 --> 00:35:08.856
You know, she's always off
doing something

572
00:35:08.858 --> 00:35:10.840
and trying to save the world
from something

573
00:35:10.842 --> 00:35:13.657
but this one, you know,
really takes the kick.

574
00:35:13.659 --> 00:35:14.906
Wow.

575
00:35:14.908 --> 00:35:16.761
My mom never leaves me alone.

576
00:35:16.763 --> 00:35:18.138
- So...
- Well... Heh.

577
00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:19.354
I wish I knew
what that was like.

578
00:35:19.356 --> 00:35:21.595
Trust me, you really don't.

579
00:35:23.196 --> 00:35:24.825
I guess the grass
is always greener.

580
00:35:24.827 --> 00:35:26.076
Yeah, I guess.

581
00:35:30.715 --> 00:35:32.027
What the hell is that?

582
00:35:33.755 --> 00:35:35.640
That's not good.

583
00:35:35.642 --> 00:35:37.433
Look, it's one thing
for some kook

584
00:35:37.435 --> 00:35:39.224
to wax on about the apocalypse

585
00:35:39.226 --> 00:35:41.240
it's a whole other scenario when
the things she warned us about

586
00:35:41.242 --> 00:35:42.681
actually start to happen.

587
00:35:42.683 --> 00:35:45.560
- The weapon was destroyed.
- How certain are you?

588
00:35:45.562 --> 00:35:47.065
France is on a fault line, sir.

589
00:35:47.067 --> 00:35:48.377
They've suffered major
earthquakes before.

590
00:35:48.379 --> 00:35:50.426
This is all just
bad coincidence.

591
00:35:50.428 --> 00:35:52.090
From our intel, it's a bit more
than just an earthquake.

592
00:35:52.092 --> 00:35:54.714
And I don't subscribe
to bad coincidences.

593
00:35:54.715 --> 00:35:56.857
When our offices were hacked,
you know what got leaked.

594
00:35:56.859 --> 00:35:58.617
I don't have to tell you this.

595
00:35:58.619 --> 00:36:02.202
So, did we or did we not
ever get Hellstorm operational?

596
00:36:02.204 --> 00:36:03.801
No, there's never been
a successful test.

597
00:36:03.803 --> 00:36:05.657
Even Nikola Tesla
couldn't figure that one out.

598
00:36:05.659 --> 00:36:07.132
And he discovered it.

599
00:36:08.571 --> 00:36:11.194
You know what they say
about a hundred monkeys?

600
00:36:11.196 --> 00:36:13.145
No. What?

601
00:36:13.147 --> 00:36:14.841
Lock them in a room
with some typewriters

602
00:36:14.843 --> 00:36:17.817
and eventually you'll get
a few lines of Shakespeare.

603
00:36:17.819 --> 00:36:19.512
It's time we started
running some scenarios

604
00:36:19.514 --> 00:36:21.723
on the off-chance that this
wasn't just a coincidence.

605
00:36:23.068 --> 00:36:25.851
Sir, we have reports
of another disturbance.

606
00:36:31.226 --> 00:36:32.472
Alright, Kate,
we are leaving now.

607
00:36:32.474 --> 00:36:33.626
Did you find a pattern?

608
00:36:33.628 --> 00:36:35.257
Between setting up shop
and being chased

609
00:36:35.259 --> 00:36:36.984
by a pyroclastic debris cloud?

610
00:36:36.986 --> 00:36:38.905
No, we haven't had chance
to sit down and access it yet.

611
00:36:38.907 --> 00:36:40.249
- Just a question.
- It's not just a question.

612
00:36:40.251 --> 00:36:41.784
I know how that head
of yours works.

613
00:36:41.786 --> 00:36:43.578
No. This information.
This is what I need.

614
00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:45.145
Distance, time, location.
Do you have a printout of this?

615
00:36:45.147 --> 00:36:47.481
- Kate, come on.
- Oh.

616
00:36:47.483 --> 00:36:48.473
Come on, we gotta go.

617
00:36:48.475 --> 00:36:50.139
I need that printout.

618
00:36:52.539 --> 00:36:55.449
- What are you looking for?
- She's looking for a pattern.

619
00:36:55.451 --> 00:36:57.018
Pattern?

620
00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:58.201
The only way to reverse
what's already happened

621
00:36:58.203 --> 00:36:59.546
is to predict
the waves in formation.

622
00:36:59.548 --> 00:37:02.074
The what? Man, this is
way above my pay grade.

623
00:37:02.076 --> 00:37:03.705
Kate, we're out of time.
We have to go.

624
00:37:03.707 --> 00:37:05.081
No, I got to get one more
reading.

625
00:37:08.922 --> 00:37:10.776
- Ah.
- Ahh!

626
00:37:13.466 --> 00:37:14.394
Go!

627
00:37:19.578 --> 00:37:21.883
That's really, really not good.

628
00:37:23.131 --> 00:37:24.345
- Jessie!
- Ah!

629
00:37:24.347 --> 00:37:25.756
- Ah!
- Jessie!

630
00:37:27.066 --> 00:37:28.824
- Get to the truck.
- What is that?

631
00:37:28.826 --> 00:37:30.779
Just get to the truck.

632
00:37:35.355 --> 00:37:36.634
Martin, come on!

633
00:37:36.636 --> 00:37:38.331
We gotta go. Just leave it!

634
00:37:40.283 --> 00:37:41.563
Martin, get out!

635
00:37:42.779 --> 00:37:44.348
Martin, come on!

636
00:37:46.555 --> 00:37:48.953
I got it!

637
00:37:50.427 --> 00:37:52.060
No!

638
00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:54.939
Martin! Martin!

639
00:37:58.875 --> 00:38:00.888
- No!
- He's gone.

640
00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:02.808
- No, no, no!
- He's gone.

641
00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:04.218
He's gone!

642
00:38:39.194 --> 00:38:40.539
Watch out!

643
00:39:06.875 --> 00:39:08.700
The storm's gone.

644
00:39:10.971 --> 00:39:12.634
Kate, we gotta go back.
We can't leave him there.

645
00:39:12.635 --> 00:39:14.648
- Rob, he's gone.
- We got to get his body.

646
00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:16.376
The only reason that storm
didn't kill us all

647
00:39:16.378 --> 00:39:19.449
didn't take this entire park out
is because of where we are.

648
00:39:19.451 --> 00:39:22.137
The San Andreas is a major
vein on the Yellowstone Caldera

649
00:39:22.139 --> 00:39:24.825
and we are sitting on
a ticking time bomb.

650
00:39:24.827 --> 00:39:26.331
Which is why you need to go.

651
00:39:27.771 --> 00:39:29.272
- Go?
- Yes, it's too dangerous.

652
00:39:29.274 --> 00:39:31.225
I need you to take the kids
and get out of here.

653
00:39:31.227 --> 00:39:33.176
Of course, you know, we've only
been together for a few hours.

654
00:39:33.178 --> 00:39:35.032
- That's good enough, right?
- It's not fair.

655
00:39:35.034 --> 00:39:36.345
Jessie, every minute
you are here

656
00:39:36.347 --> 00:39:38.456
is a minute you are more
in danger.

657
00:39:38.458 --> 00:39:41.208
Exactly my point.
And you feel the need to stay?

658
00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:42.649
Just like you decided
to risk your life in some

659
00:39:42.651 --> 00:39:44.216
Godforsaken desert somewhere?

660
00:39:44.218 --> 00:39:46.233
So not the time to be having
this discussion.

661
00:39:46.234 --> 00:39:48.283
Of course it's not.
You never want to talk about it.

662
00:39:52.187 --> 00:39:55.001
Okay, you know this park,
where's the closest exit?

663
00:39:55.003 --> 00:39:56.953
No. Listen, Kate.

664
00:39:56.955 --> 00:39:59.961
If you're right, where are we
gonna go that we're safe, huh?

665
00:39:59.963 --> 00:40:01.881
Los Angeles? San Francisco?

666
00:40:01.883 --> 00:40:04.696
There's nowhere that we can go
that we're not in danger.

667
00:40:04.698 --> 00:40:09.272
Now, we are not leaving you.
You understand?

668
00:40:09.274 --> 00:40:12.184
But if you have a plan,
I sure would like to hear it.

669
00:40:12.186 --> 00:40:13.753
If I just got
the rest of those readings

670
00:40:13.755 --> 00:40:14.937
off that computer,
I could have enough information.

671
00:40:14.939 --> 00:40:16.345
She's pacing.
What does that mean?

672
00:40:16.347 --> 00:40:19.641
- It means she's thinking.
- Or just triangulate.

673
00:40:19.643 --> 00:40:21.145
Yeah, if we can triangulate
the waves, we can get

674
00:40:21.147 --> 00:40:22.553
three different readings
from three different locations.

675
00:40:22.555 --> 00:40:24.408
That might be
enough information.

676
00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:27.608
- Enough for what?
- To try and isolate the wave.

677
00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:28.824
You think you can
stop this thing?

678
00:40:28.826 --> 00:40:32.345
Whoa, wait. What?

679
00:40:32.347 --> 00:40:34.009
We're gonna stop this thing?

680
00:40:34.011 --> 00:40:35.289
Us? Right here?

681
00:40:35.291 --> 00:40:36.792
This thing that's
tearing up the globe?

682
00:40:36.794 --> 00:40:38.969
Yeah, but we're gonna
need a little help.

683
00:40:38.971 --> 00:40:41.080
Y-you're talking about
an explosion in the magnitude

684
00:40:41.082 --> 00:40:43.640
of a-a one kiloton nuclear bomb!

685
00:40:43.642 --> 00:40:45.721
Where are we gonna get that?

686
00:40:45.723 --> 00:40:47.801
- That's plan B.
- She has a plan B.

687
00:40:47.803 --> 00:40:49.561
- Like this one.
- Okay, look, we're here.

688
00:40:49.563 --> 00:40:51.580
This is where we need to go
to get the first reading.

689
00:41:12.986 --> 00:41:15.224
<i>The Hellstorm
weapon is operational.</i>

690
00:41:15.226 --> 00:41:18.457
You mean the weapon
that doesn't exist?

691
00:41:18.459 --> 00:41:20.312
<i>Sorry, just trying to clarify.</i>

692
00:41:20.314 --> 00:41:23.384
Trying to get my head around
this whole thing. I'll shut up.

693
00:41:23.386 --> 00:41:25.144
Hellstorm is a device
that uses resonance

694
00:41:25.146 --> 00:41:26.809
to amplify toroidal currents

695
00:41:26.811 --> 00:41:29.081
deep within the earth's crust
causing disasters.

696
00:41:29.083 --> 00:41:30.617
Now you've all seen
an opera singer break

697
00:41:30.619 --> 00:41:32.536
a crystal glass with her voice.

698
00:41:32.538 --> 00:41:34.713
It's the same thing,
but on a global scale.

699
00:41:34.715 --> 00:41:36.376
<i>Hellstorm is the voice</i>

700
00:41:36.378 --> 00:41:37.368
<i>the earth's crust</i>

701
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:39.865
<i>is the crystal glass.</i>

702
00:41:39.867 --> 00:41:42.137
<i>Now the fracture is so deep
within the earth's crust</i>

703
00:41:42.139 --> 00:41:43.736
that it releases a rush
of high pressure gases

704
00:41:43.738 --> 00:41:45.305
causing these storms.

705
00:41:45.307 --> 00:41:48.152
It's a one-two punch
of natural disasters.

706
00:41:48.154 --> 00:41:52.216
As a result, the earthquakes
release the powerful storms.

707
00:41:52.218 --> 00:41:54.136
It'll wipe out any city it hits.

708
00:41:54.138 --> 00:41:55.736
If it's a wave as you say it is

709
00:41:55.738 --> 00:41:58.457
then it should just
fade overtime, get weaker.

710
00:41:58.459 --> 00:41:59.833
No, wh-when the device is active

711
00:41:59.834 --> 00:42:02.712
it's designed to get
stronger over time.

712
00:42:02.714 --> 00:42:05.528
<i>That's what a resonance weapon
is designed to do.</i>

713
00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:08.089
So, we take it out.
Bomb the area again.

714
00:42:08.091 --> 00:42:09.527
It's not that simple.
It's too deep.

715
00:42:09.529 --> 00:42:11.193
Our most powerful weapon
has a range

716
00:42:11.195 --> 00:42:13.081
of 200 feet below the surface.

717
00:42:13.083 --> 00:42:14.969
Hellstorm by now
is over a thousand feet deep.

718
00:42:14.971 --> 00:42:16.665
Besides a bomb of that magnitude

719
00:42:16.667 --> 00:42:19.161
on foreign soil would only
exacerbate global tensions.

720
00:42:19.163 --> 00:42:21.017
Global tensions?

721
00:42:21.019 --> 00:42:23.292
Sir, have you seen the news?

722
00:42:26.874 --> 00:42:28.539
Got it, I'm shutting up.

723
00:42:31.675 --> 00:42:33.625
<i>Now there is
good news, however.</i>

724
00:42:33.627 --> 00:42:35.096
<i>In our preliminary test
with the weapon</i>

725
00:42:35.098 --> 00:42:36.408
<i>there's a signature.</i>

726
00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:38.104
<i>It's a signal
that's associated</i>

727
00:42:38.106 --> 00:42:40.664
with the ultra-low frequency
waves that it sends out.

728
00:42:40.666 --> 00:42:43.544
Uh, drones, radio arrays,
whatever you can tap into

729
00:42:43.546 --> 00:42:44.793
<i>we have to find that signal.</i>

730
00:42:44.795 --> 00:42:46.776
<i>It's the first
and most important step</i>

731
00:42:46.778 --> 00:42:48.345
<i>in stopping this.</i>

732
00:42:48.347 --> 00:42:50.171
What if we don't stop it?

733
00:42:51.451 --> 00:42:53.372
Then it's an end-game scenario.

734
00:42:57.466 --> 00:42:59.865
<i>There are several hotspots
around the globe.</i>

735
00:42:59.867 --> 00:43:02.744
<i>Pacific Rim,
Indonesia, Yellowstone.</i>

736
00:43:02.746 --> 00:43:04.344
A Hellstorm eruption
in one of those areas

737
00:43:04.346 --> 00:43:06.008
would not just threaten a city

738
00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:07.735
it would threaten
the human race.

739
00:43:39.514 --> 00:43:40.730
Bite me.

740
00:43:46.363 --> 00:43:48.763
Godspeed, you wonderful monster.

741
00:43:55.803 --> 00:43:58.008
Did the server crash?

742
00:43:58.010 --> 00:43:59.897
It seems li... It seems like it.

743
00:43:59.899 --> 00:44:01.659
I'm-I'm locked out.
Is everyone else locked out?

744
00:44:10.362 --> 00:44:11.993
Yes, sir.

745
00:44:11.995 --> 00:44:13.948
Uh, no, we have a team working
on that as we speak, sir.

746
00:44:15.354 --> 00:44:17.624
Of course. Call it a...

747
00:44:17.625 --> 00:44:18.843
A contingency plan.

748
00:44:20.954 --> 00:44:21.976
Yeah, yes, sir.

749
00:44:21.978 --> 00:44:23.356
Yes, sir. Will do.

750
00:44:30.202 --> 00:44:31.448
Yes?

751
00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:33.432
Our entire network was
just shut down.

752
00:44:33.434 --> 00:44:36.184
- We've been hacked.
- Oh, damn it.

753
00:44:36.186 --> 00:44:38.619
- Well, h-how extensive is it?
- Everything, sir.

754
00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:43.771
Have we found that signal yet?

755
00:45:06.747 --> 00:45:07.992
The Hellstorm weapon

756
00:45:07.994 --> 00:45:10.649
creates a catastrophic
wave of energy.

757
00:45:10.651 --> 00:45:12.280
And we're gonna need an equal

758
00:45:12.282 --> 00:45:15.256
and opposite wave of energy
to destroy it.

759
00:45:15.258 --> 00:45:16.474
So that's what
we're looking for.

760
00:45:18.266 --> 00:45:20.344
Okay, I think it's working.

761
00:45:20.346 --> 00:45:21.594
Good job, Jake.

762
00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:27.192
So what are we supposed
to do now?

763
00:45:27.194 --> 00:45:28.888
Just kinda wait for something
bad to happen?

764
00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:32.088
Yeah. Hope that
the next one isn't as bad.

765
00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:33.595
That's not very comforting.

766
00:45:38.491 --> 00:45:39.672
You should go talk to her.

767
00:45:39.674 --> 00:45:42.393
I don't know how to talk to her.

768
00:45:42.395 --> 00:45:46.107
Kate, she's not a mathematical
equation that you can get wrong.

769
00:45:47.386 --> 00:45:49.783
You're her mother.

770
00:45:49.785 --> 00:45:51.002
Just talk to her.

771
00:45:54.586 --> 00:45:55.802
Okay, we're getting something.

772
00:46:01.401 --> 00:46:02.711
- This is it.
- Get on the timer.

773
00:46:02.713 --> 00:46:04.186
- Record the readings.
- I'm trying.

774
00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:25.912
You okay?

775
00:46:25.914 --> 00:46:27.449
I think it stopped.

776
00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:30.200
Is one of the storms coming?
Are we dead?

777
00:46:30.202 --> 00:46:31.163
Jake...

778
00:46:32.698 --> 00:46:34.360
- Jake, we're fine.
- Oh, of course.

779
00:46:34.362 --> 00:46:35.802
Yeah, no, I knew that.

780
00:46:37.147 --> 00:46:39.611
- Did you get the reading?
- Yeah.

781
00:46:42.138 --> 00:46:44.695
Now I know why Rob
likes having you around.

782
00:46:44.697 --> 00:46:46.872
Thanks.

783
00:46:46.874 --> 00:46:48.824
We have one
reading, we need two more.

784
00:46:48.826 --> 00:46:49.976
Guys, the quicker
we get these readings

785
00:46:49.978 --> 00:46:51.386
the quicker
we can get out of here.

786
00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:54.199
What do you have in mind?

787
00:46:54.201 --> 00:46:57.144
See if we got the equipment,
we got walkies in the truck.

788
00:46:57.145 --> 00:46:58.267
We need to split up.

789
00:47:00.825 --> 00:47:02.839
I think it's a bad idea.

790
00:47:02.841 --> 00:47:04.184
We are standing
on the San Andreas Fault.

791
00:47:04.186 --> 00:47:05.784
I need readings
from both plates.

792
00:47:05.785 --> 00:47:07.096
The Pacific
and the North American.

793
00:47:07.097 --> 00:47:08.923
That bad idea
is our only chance.

794
00:47:11.002 --> 00:47:12.442
I'll go with Dad.

795
00:47:13.465 --> 00:47:15.385
No, wait.

796
00:47:15.386 --> 00:47:18.552
You go with your mother.
Jake, you're with me.

797
00:47:18.554 --> 00:47:20.567
We're gonna take the truck,
we'll go up that ridge up there

798
00:47:20.569 --> 00:47:22.521
we'll get our reading. You guys
get your reading right here.

799
00:47:22.523 --> 00:47:25.274
When we're done, we'll meet back
at the bridge. Okay?

800
00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:28.984
You guys be careful,
that last shake that we had

801
00:47:28.986 --> 00:47:31.194
is hitting somewhere else,
and we're not gonna be as lucky.

802
00:47:33.499 --> 00:47:34.523
Hey...

803
00:47:36.314 --> 00:47:37.818
Be careful.

804
00:47:48.443 --> 00:47:49.787
Thank you.

805
00:47:57.657 --> 00:47:59.800
Okay, folks, I got a problem,
needs fixing.

806
00:47:59.801 --> 00:48:01.240
Who's my best tech?

807
00:48:01.242 --> 00:48:02.458
- That's me. Right here.
- I am.

808
00:48:05.401 --> 00:48:08.090
Right. Drew. Come with me.

809
00:48:09.882 --> 00:48:11.483
- Come on, let's go.
- Coming.

810
00:48:14.459 --> 00:48:16.376
Oh! Earthquake.

811
00:48:43.898 --> 00:48:45.592
Okay, it's over.

812
00:48:45.594 --> 00:48:46.906
Back to work, people.

813
00:48:48.794 --> 00:48:50.584
Let's go. Come on.

814
00:48:50.586 --> 00:48:52.312
This whole building is gonna
come down on top of us

815
00:48:52.314 --> 00:48:54.263
we'll be trapped inside,
that's like, my worst nightmare.

816
00:48:54.265 --> 00:48:55.608
Well, from what I've been
hearing around the world

817
00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:57.019
you'd be a lucky one.

818
00:48:58.586 --> 00:49:00.919
Alright.
Get in there, plug in.

819
00:49:00.921 --> 00:49:02.235
You get 30 minutes.
The gate clock ticking.

820
00:49:12.761 --> 00:49:13.690
Okay.

821
00:49:30.523 --> 00:49:32.600
<i>We're approaching the
bridge with our equipment.</i>

822
00:49:32.602 --> 00:49:34.361
<i>Everything you need
should be in those bags.</i>

823
00:49:34.363 --> 00:49:37.273
Copy that, Rob. We're
on our way to set it up.

824
00:49:37.274 --> 00:49:39.640
This just feels
kind of ironic, huh?

825
00:49:39.642 --> 00:49:40.632
What's that?

826
00:49:40.634 --> 00:49:42.263
I remember when you and I

827
00:49:42.265 --> 00:49:44.568
would go hike
the canyons together.

828
00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:47.544
That was ages ago.
What was I, like, five?

829
00:49:47.546 --> 00:49:49.496
Okay, you know what?
I get that you're upset with me.

830
00:49:49.498 --> 00:49:50.907
Yeah, what gave it away?

831
00:49:52.377 --> 00:49:55.608
- Let's set up here.
- Yeah. Work.

832
00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:57.850
So much easier than having
a real discussion.

833
00:50:20.635 --> 00:50:21.946
You sure this is it?

834
00:50:23.801 --> 00:50:27.160
Yeah, yeah. This is it.

835
00:50:27.162 --> 00:50:30.041
- We'll set up right here.
- Okay.

836
00:50:30.043 --> 00:50:31.033
Kate...

837
00:50:31.034 --> 00:50:34.073
Kate, we're in position.

838
00:50:34.075 --> 00:50:35.864
<i>Right. Let me know
when you're up and running.</i>

839
00:50:35.866 --> 00:50:36.986
Copy.

840
00:50:43.545 --> 00:50:44.762
Here.

841
00:50:49.498 --> 00:50:51.195
Here, plug it in.

842
00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:01.784
Come on.
What's wrong with this thing?

843
00:51:01.786 --> 00:51:04.344
Oh, you press this.

844
00:51:04.346 --> 00:51:06.906
Look at that.
Your dad taught you well.

845
00:51:08.826 --> 00:51:10.649
Yeah.

846
00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:12.663
- I'm up.
- Me too.

847
00:51:12.665 --> 00:51:15.320
- I'm already getting readings.
- Oh, wow.

848
00:51:15.322 --> 00:51:18.167
- This is crazy.
- Look at that frequency.

849
00:51:18.169 --> 00:51:19.643
Yeah, it's definitely building.

850
00:51:42.106 --> 00:51:44.153
- Is there a problem?
- Uh, no.

851
00:51:44.155 --> 00:51:47.096
I was just gonna go use
the restroom. Uh, I...

852
00:51:47.098 --> 00:51:48.280
I didn't ask for permission,
it's sort of

853
00:51:48.282 --> 00:51:49.879
I got an emergency, you know?

854
00:51:49.881 --> 00:51:52.026
Code red,
uh, code brown, actually.

855
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:55.736
Ah, just go. Make it quick.

856
00:51:55.738 --> 00:51:57.496
- Okay.
- Hold it. You...

857
00:51:57.498 --> 00:51:59.065
You're not taking your laptop?

858
00:51:59.067 --> 00:52:01.403
Well... Yeah.

859
00:52:02.746 --> 00:52:05.592
I mean, I might be
in there for a while

860
00:52:05.594 --> 00:52:07.607
so I figured I'd just, you know,
get some work done, maybe...

861
00:52:07.609 --> 00:52:09.880
No, I need you to give it to me.

862
00:52:09.882 --> 00:52:11.385
Come on.
Why don't you hand it over now?

863
00:52:11.386 --> 00:52:12.920
No, no, no, no, no, no.

864
00:52:12.922 --> 00:52:14.744
- Security!
- Sir! Sir, stop!

865
00:52:14.746 --> 00:52:16.570
I need the building
on lockdown right now.

866
00:52:23.034 --> 00:52:24.283
Stop him! Stop him!

867
00:52:26.299 --> 00:52:28.058
What am I doing?
What am I doing?

868
00:52:59.354 --> 00:53:01.275
I'm going to jail.
But not today.

869
00:53:16.377 --> 00:53:17.625
No soup for you.

870
00:53:20.249 --> 00:53:21.403
- Get up.
- Ugh.

871
00:53:30.234 --> 00:53:33.144
Another breach?
Who's messing with us?

872
00:53:33.146 --> 00:53:34.871
I don't have to tell you
the ramifications of all this

873
00:53:34.873 --> 00:53:36.695
should any of it to find its way
back to our doorstep.

874
00:53:36.697 --> 00:53:39.352
- It's not my first day, sir.
- I'm aware.

875
00:53:39.353 --> 00:53:41.560
Just make sure
it's not your last.

876
00:53:41.562 --> 00:53:43.320
I'm on a plane
to brief the joint chiefs.

877
00:53:43.322 --> 00:53:45.463
When I land...
Uh, let me correct that.

878
00:53:45.465 --> 00:53:47.927
If I land, I wanna know that
the situation's been

879
00:53:47.929 --> 00:53:49.210
scrubbed and sanitized.

880
00:53:50.457 --> 00:53:51.866
Are we clear?

881
00:53:52.825 --> 00:53:54.071
Yes, sir.

882
00:53:54.073 --> 00:53:55.864
You have my permission
to proceed...

883
00:53:55.866 --> 00:53:57.498
with impunity.

884
00:54:17.593 --> 00:54:19.736
Lot of seismic activity
over here.

885
00:54:19.738 --> 00:54:22.776
- Ooh! Look at that.
- Wow.

886
00:54:22.778 --> 00:54:24.312
- We got one coming soon.
- Yeah.

887
00:54:24.314 --> 00:54:25.785
Something's definitely coming.

888
00:54:27.898 --> 00:54:30.171
Hey, Mom? I think we're
picking up something.

889
00:54:47.513 --> 00:54:50.138
- Mom?
- Rob! Rob, come in.

890
00:54:53.434 --> 00:54:56.120
- You good?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, fine.

891
00:54:56.122 --> 00:54:57.303
Kate?

892
00:54:57.305 --> 00:54:59.095
Kate, come in.

893
00:54:59.097 --> 00:55:00.762
- Mom, we need to go now.
- Rob? Rob, come in.

894
00:55:02.041 --> 00:55:03.224
- Rob. No, Rob!
- Mom.

895
00:55:03.226 --> 00:55:05.688
Kate, come in. Damn it!

896
00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:08.504
Professor, is this normal?

897
00:55:08.506 --> 00:55:12.472
No, that is not normal.

898
00:55:12.474 --> 00:55:13.690
Brace yourself.

899
00:55:22.553 --> 00:55:25.658
Mom... We need to leave.

900
00:55:36.985 --> 00:55:38.648
That's not good.

901
00:55:38.650 --> 00:55:41.338
No. No, it's not.

902
00:55:45.082 --> 00:55:47.160
Mom! We have to go!

903
00:55:47.162 --> 00:55:50.327
- I have to get this data.
- Mom! Mom!

904
00:55:50.329 --> 00:55:51.960
- Jessie!
- Mom!

905
00:55:51.962 --> 00:55:54.584
- Jessie!
- Mom, please!

906
00:55:54.586 --> 00:55:56.826
Mom! Come on!

907
00:55:57.945 --> 00:55:59.384
Jessie, run. Jessie, go!

908
00:56:02.202 --> 00:56:03.672
Mom, we have to go!

909
00:56:03.674 --> 00:56:04.695
I got it, I got it.

910
00:56:04.697 --> 00:56:06.233
- Go, go!
- Mom, come on.

911
00:56:12.121 --> 00:56:13.338
Run!

912
00:56:15.929 --> 00:56:17.753
Let's go. Come on!

913
00:56:20.474 --> 00:56:21.690
Get down!

914
00:56:23.610 --> 00:56:25.467
We gotta go! In the truck!

915
00:56:47.610 --> 00:56:49.303
Do you have any idea

916
00:56:49.305 --> 00:56:51.608
the depth of the trouble
you're in?

917
00:56:51.610 --> 00:56:53.335
Me?

918
00:56:53.337 --> 00:56:54.650
Don't you mean us?

919
00:56:58.138 --> 00:56:59.800
Okay, okay, okay, I get the...

920
00:57:09.402 --> 00:57:12.408
I don't think you appreciate
the situation you're in.

921
00:57:12.410 --> 00:57:13.720
We looked at your computer.

922
00:57:13.722 --> 00:57:15.640
You hacked into
a government database.

923
00:57:15.642 --> 00:57:17.175
You stole classified documents.

924
00:57:17.177 --> 00:57:19.097
Now, where did you send them?

925
00:57:20.249 --> 00:57:22.936
I sent them to my mother.

926
00:57:22.938 --> 00:57:25.051
I thought it was a recipe
for sugar cookies.

927
00:57:30.298 --> 00:57:33.976
Okay, okay, okay.

928
00:57:33.978 --> 00:57:36.695
I sent them to the professor.

929
00:57:36.697 --> 00:57:38.392
She knows more about this
than any of us.

930
00:57:38.394 --> 00:57:40.408
No, she doesn't.

931
00:57:40.410 --> 00:57:42.136
We have all the data.

932
00:57:42.138 --> 00:57:44.503
Not just hers, but an entire
network of information.

933
00:57:44.505 --> 00:57:45.880
Now, she's just one person.

934
00:57:45.882 --> 00:57:47.000
Have you ever
stopped to consider

935
00:57:47.002 --> 00:57:49.847
what would happen
if she's wrong?

936
00:57:49.849 --> 00:57:51.991
I will not allow her
to doom humanity

937
00:57:51.993 --> 00:57:54.871
in some ill-conceived attempt
to save it.

938
00:57:54.873 --> 00:57:57.370
No, 'cause you've got
that covered, don't you?

939
00:57:58.617 --> 00:58:00.474
Oh, come on,
you know you want to.

940
00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:09.240
You work out?

941
00:58:09.242 --> 00:58:10.456
You listen to me

942
00:58:10.458 --> 00:58:12.376
you little speck of nothing.

943
00:58:12.378 --> 00:58:14.136
Once this is all over,
and you and the professor

944
00:58:14.138 --> 00:58:15.960
are deemed enemies of the state.

945
00:58:15.962 --> 00:58:17.655
I will make it my mission
to make sure

946
00:58:17.657 --> 00:58:19.032
you end up in the darkest

947
00:58:19.033 --> 00:58:20.599
vilest hole imaginable

948
00:58:20.601 --> 00:58:22.071
to spend the rest of your long

949
00:58:22.073 --> 00:58:24.056
and agonizing life

950
00:58:24.058 --> 00:58:26.458
unless you tell me where she is.

951
00:58:28.728 --> 00:58:30.393
Now, where is she?

952
00:58:39.417 --> 00:58:41.751
Rob, come in.

953
00:58:41.753 --> 00:58:43.639
Rob, come in.

954
00:58:43.641 --> 00:58:46.584
- Why aren't they answering?
- I don't know.

955
00:58:46.586 --> 00:58:47.704
You don't think
they could have been caught

956
00:58:47.706 --> 00:58:48.759
in that explosion, do you?

957
00:58:48.761 --> 00:58:49.911
They were right across from us

958
00:58:49.913 --> 00:58:51.512
if they set up
in the right area.

959
00:58:51.514 --> 00:58:52.824
They could've got caught
in that eruption.

960
00:58:52.826 --> 00:58:55.192
- They weren't.
- You don't know that.

961
00:58:55.194 --> 00:58:56.858
Rob, come in. We need that info.

962
00:58:58.170 --> 00:58:59.928
I thought
you were worried about Dad.

963
00:58:59.930 --> 00:59:01.111
- I am.
- No.

964
00:59:01.113 --> 00:59:02.839
You're worried
about getting his info.

965
00:59:02.841 --> 00:59:05.206
You don't think I'm worried
about your father right now?

966
00:59:05.208 --> 00:59:07.031
Who knows what you worry about

967
00:59:07.032 --> 00:59:08.826
when you're halfway
around the world?

968
00:59:12.281 --> 00:59:14.488
We're not looking for them.

969
00:59:14.490 --> 00:59:15.895
So what are you doing?

970
00:59:15.897 --> 00:59:18.201
Looking for an important e-mail.

971
00:59:25.273 --> 00:59:27.352
I'm gonna go look for Dad.

972
00:59:27.354 --> 00:59:29.047
Uh, no. Uh, you're not
going anywhere.

973
00:59:29.049 --> 00:59:30.906
We're not splitting up.
Not in this.

974
00:59:36.921 --> 00:59:40.346
Holy crap! He did it!
He got, uh, he got the files.

975
00:59:41.721 --> 00:59:45.080
All you care about
are these files!

976
00:59:45.081 --> 00:59:47.255
And in the meantime,
Dad could have gotten killed

977
00:59:47.257 --> 00:59:49.207
in an explosion!

978
00:59:49.209 --> 00:59:50.712
Jessie, there are things
in this world

979
00:59:50.714 --> 00:59:51.928
that are bigger than you and me.

980
00:59:51.930 --> 00:59:53.143
They are bigger than family.

981
00:59:53.145 --> 00:59:55.770
Nothing is bigger than family!

982
01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:02.455
Okay, you're right.
You're right.

983
01:00:02.457 --> 01:00:03.736
Jess, it's just
sometimes the world

984
01:00:03.738 --> 01:00:05.720
isn't that black and white.

985
01:00:05.722 --> 01:00:08.279
- Why can't it be?
- Because it's not.

986
01:00:08.281 --> 01:00:09.591
For me it never has been.

987
01:00:09.593 --> 01:00:12.280
I make sacrifices,
and I live with them.

988
01:00:12.282 --> 01:00:14.711
And I do dangerous things
that take me away from you

989
01:00:14.713 --> 01:00:16.184
because I have to.

990
01:00:16.186 --> 01:00:19.031
Because it's my calling,
and I hope...

991
01:00:19.033 --> 01:00:21.465
someday that you
understand that.

992
01:00:29.496 --> 01:00:32.121
But for now... baby...

993
01:00:35.257 --> 01:00:37.463
let's just go find your dad.

994
01:00:38.713 --> 01:00:40.027
Let's go.

995
01:00:41.945 --> 01:00:43.065
Rob.

996
01:00:44.186 --> 01:00:45.816
Rob, come in. Do you hear me?

997
01:00:45.817 --> 01:00:47.830
We don't have all day so...

998
01:00:47.832 --> 01:00:50.427
this is gonna keep going until
you give me a reason to stop.

999
01:00:51.769 --> 01:00:53.752
Now, where is she,
and what is she doing?

1000
01:00:53.753 --> 01:00:55.991
I don't know.

1001
01:00:55.993 --> 01:00:58.295
I swear.

1002
01:00:58.296 --> 01:01:01.721
Sir, intel thinks they found
the Hellstorm wave signature.

1003
01:01:04.664 --> 01:01:06.746
I may not need you after all.

1004
01:01:26.328 --> 01:01:28.185
Kate! Jessie! Come in.

1005
01:01:30.745 --> 01:01:32.697
They're not here?

1006
01:01:36.857 --> 01:01:39.546
Kate. Kate, Jessie, come in.

1007
01:01:43.002 --> 01:01:44.251
Kate, come in.

1008
01:01:49.209 --> 01:01:51.223
Kate!

1009
01:01:51.225 --> 01:01:53.047
Jessie!

1010
01:01:53.049 --> 01:01:54.203
Jessie!

1011
01:01:58.489 --> 01:02:00.411
Kate, come in. Come on, please.

1012
01:02:02.521 --> 01:02:04.248
Come on, guys, please.

1013
01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:05.784
Kate!

1014
01:02:05.786 --> 01:02:07.511
Rob?

1015
01:02:07.513 --> 01:02:09.271
- Kate!
- Where are they?

1016
01:02:09.273 --> 01:02:10.522
There they are. Come on.

1017
01:02:12.345 --> 01:02:14.424
- Rob!
- Dad!

1018
01:02:14.426 --> 01:02:15.833
Rob!

1019
01:02:17.305 --> 01:02:19.096
- Jessie!
- Dad!

1020
01:02:20.441 --> 01:02:21.559
Dad!

1021
01:02:24.025 --> 01:02:25.494
Oh, God.

1022
01:02:26.937 --> 01:02:28.346
Oh.

1023
01:02:32.984 --> 01:02:34.553
It's good to see you.

1024
01:02:36.154 --> 01:02:38.680
We got your data.
Let's hope it's worth it.

1025
01:02:38.682 --> 01:02:40.631
It'll be, I promise.

1026
01:02:40.633 --> 01:02:41.911
Come on.

1027
01:02:41.913 --> 01:02:43.512
- Let's get in the truck. Go.
- Okay.

1028
01:02:43.514 --> 01:02:45.015
Go.

1029
01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.544
I'm getting ready to land soon.
I need answers.

1030
01:02:51.546 --> 01:02:52.790
How long do we have?

1031
01:02:52.792 --> 01:02:54.327
By our calculations

1032
01:02:54.329 --> 01:02:56.087
the wave will hit
the Yellowstone Caldera

1033
01:02:56.089 --> 01:02:58.168
in less than five hours
and twenty-five minutes.

1034
01:02:58.170 --> 01:03:00.024
<i>Ah.</i>

1035
01:03:00.025 --> 01:03:02.072
<i>How do we stop this?</i>

1036
01:03:02.074 --> 01:03:04.089
We're working on that, sir.

1037
01:03:05.976 --> 01:03:07.193
Work faster.

1038
01:03:18.489 --> 01:03:21.048
So what are you hoping
to do with all this data?

1039
01:03:21.050 --> 01:03:22.456
Quick, Jake, if a tidal wave
were coming

1040
01:03:22.457 --> 01:03:24.151
for the coast,
how would you stop it?

1041
01:03:24.153 --> 01:03:26.039
Is that a trick question?
You can't stop a tidal wave.

1042
01:03:26.041 --> 01:03:27.191
It's a theoretical one.

1043
01:03:27.193 --> 01:03:28.983
Theoretically,
what would you do?

1044
01:03:28.985 --> 01:03:31.031
You'd open up a trench
in the bottom of the ocean.

1045
01:03:31.033 --> 01:03:33.879
The waves' energy would go down,
it would never reach the coast.

1046
01:03:33.881 --> 01:03:35.354
That's actually right.

1047
01:03:37.817 --> 01:03:39.800
- I-I was gonna say that.
- Kate, Kate.

1048
01:03:39.802 --> 01:03:41.238
I-I already told you, okay?

1049
01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:43.544
That would require
a massive explosion.

1050
01:03:43.546 --> 01:03:46.167
- We're talking nuclear.
- Yes.

1051
01:03:46.169 --> 01:03:48.151
At the exact time
and exact location.

1052
01:03:48.153 --> 01:03:49.782
It's the only way
to counteract the wave.

1053
01:03:49.784 --> 01:03:51.895
Without this, we have nothing.

1054
01:03:51.897 --> 01:03:53.784
- Oh, oh, right, right. Plan B.
- Yeah.

1055
01:03:53.785 --> 01:03:55.578
How-how is plan B coming?

1056
01:03:56.793 --> 01:03:58.073
Plan B.

1057
01:04:00.761 --> 01:04:02.266
Hey, I need Pierce.

1058
01:04:06.265 --> 01:04:07.992
Sir.

1059
01:04:07.994 --> 01:04:09.495
- Yes?
- You have a phone call.

1060
01:04:09.496 --> 01:04:10.616
Yeah. Well, I'm kinda busy here.

1061
01:04:10.618 --> 01:04:11.800
Yes, I told her that

1062
01:04:11.802 --> 01:04:13.943
but she said it's urgent.

1063
01:04:13.944 --> 01:04:15.383
Very urgent.

1064
01:04:15.385 --> 01:04:17.879
Her? Who?

1065
01:04:17.881 --> 01:04:19.130
The professor.

1066
01:04:21.657 --> 01:04:23.770
- Okay. Put her through.
- Yes, sir.

1067
01:04:34.553 --> 01:04:37.240
Professor, I'm so glad
to hear from you.

1068
01:04:37.241 --> 01:04:38.968
I'm here with...

1069
01:04:38.970 --> 01:04:40.695
your little buddy, Drew.

1070
01:04:40.697 --> 01:04:42.583
Kate, Pierce knows
what I sent you.

1071
01:04:42.585 --> 01:04:44.758
Drew, are you okay?

1072
01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:45.815
<i>Ah...</i>

1073
01:04:45.817 --> 01:04:47.864
I'm at about a ten on the pain

1074
01:04:47.866 --> 01:04:49.399
on the hospital scales.

1075
01:04:49.401 --> 01:04:50.680
Yes, we were just
telling him how much

1076
01:04:50.681 --> 01:04:53.334
we really don't like
treason over here.

1077
01:04:53.336 --> 01:04:56.151
It was a physical demonstration.

1078
01:04:56.153 --> 01:04:58.486
<i>Pierce, you son of a
bitch, you listen to me.</i>

1079
01:04:58.488 --> 01:05:00.439
Drew didn't just send me
info on Hellstorm

1080
01:05:00.441 --> 01:05:02.423
I have everything,
I have all the data.

1081
01:05:02.425 --> 01:05:04.919
<i>I have all the files.
I have proof.</i>

1082
01:05:04.921 --> 01:05:06.679
<i>Proof that you knew
there was a weapon.</i>

1083
01:05:06.681 --> 01:05:08.695
Proof that sensitive files
were hacked out of your office

1084
01:05:08.697 --> 01:05:09.880
and given into enemy hands.

1085
01:05:09.881 --> 01:05:11.416
Proof that when
you went in to save it

1086
01:05:11.418 --> 01:05:13.335
<i>all you ended up doing
was turning it on.</i>

1087
01:05:13.337 --> 01:05:15.255
<i>You have blood
all over your hands.</i>

1088
01:05:15.257 --> 01:05:17.115
Your hands are covered in blood.

1089
01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.951
That does not sound good.

1090
01:05:20.953 --> 01:05:22.390
Phil, listen,
we can make a deal right now

1091
01:05:22.392 --> 01:05:23.576
before this gets any worse

1092
01:05:23.577 --> 01:05:25.047
and trust me,
it's going to get worse.

1093
01:05:25.049 --> 01:05:26.423
I can stop it.

1094
01:05:26.425 --> 01:05:28.185
But I need the help
of the US Military.

1095
01:05:29.784 --> 01:05:33.431
Military? W-W-What exactly
are you proposing?

1096
01:05:33.433 --> 01:05:36.279
I need a device that is capable
of delivering the equivalent

1097
01:05:36.281 --> 01:05:37.846
of one kiloton explosion.

1098
01:05:37.848 --> 01:05:40.760
Ah. Are you joking? That's...

1099
01:05:40.762 --> 01:05:43.158
You're talking about
a small nuclear device.

1100
01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.600
On US soil, no less.

1101
01:05:44.602 --> 01:05:46.390
Yes, I am, and you have it

1102
01:05:46.392 --> 01:05:47.863
but I'm talking about
a fair trade.

1103
01:05:47.865 --> 01:05:50.072
All of the files
for all of your help

1104
01:05:50.074 --> 01:05:51.706
plus Drew.

1105
01:05:54.714 --> 01:05:58.391
You're talking
about nuclear munitions.

1106
01:05:58.393 --> 01:06:00.535
Hellstorm isn't stopping.

1107
01:06:00.537 --> 01:06:02.232
If this wave activity
ignites Yellowstone

1108
01:06:02.234 --> 01:06:03.767
it is an end-game scenario.

1109
01:06:03.769 --> 01:06:06.074
<i>This is as bad as it gets.</i>

1110
01:06:14.970 --> 01:06:16.250
You're right.

1111
01:06:17.881 --> 01:06:19.480
I'm sorry, come again?

1112
01:06:19.482 --> 01:06:21.463
The device will reach
the Yellowstone Caldera

1113
01:06:21.465 --> 01:06:23.672
in a little over five hours.

1114
01:06:23.674 --> 01:06:26.392
Okay, yes, but given the right
tools we can stop it here.

1115
01:06:26.394 --> 01:06:29.207
Now, what kind of power
do you think I have?

1116
01:06:29.209 --> 01:06:30.775
You have enough assets
at your disposal.

1117
01:06:30.777 --> 01:06:32.151
You didn't listen to me once.

1118
01:06:32.153 --> 01:06:33.143
Don't make the same mistake
again.

1119
01:06:33.145 --> 01:06:34.779
We are running out of time.

1120
01:06:36.472 --> 01:06:37.434
Uh...

1121
01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:41.049
I'll get back to you.

1122
01:06:44.568 --> 01:06:46.425
You've gotta like her style.

1123
01:06:47.514 --> 01:06:50.746
Now, am I free to go?

1124
01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:55.033
Not exactly.

1125
01:07:01.945 --> 01:07:04.983
If this is gonna work,
we gotta get underground.

1126
01:07:04.985 --> 01:07:05.914
Yeah.

1127
01:07:07.161 --> 01:07:08.919
There's a tunnel system.

1128
01:07:08.921 --> 01:07:11.479
Inside of the old mines,
not too far from here.

1129
01:07:11.481 --> 01:07:13.462
I think it might be deep enough.

1130
01:07:13.464 --> 01:07:16.217
- What are we waiting for?
- Let's go.

1131
01:07:19.672 --> 01:07:22.072
I don't think that's a bad idea.

1132
01:07:22.074 --> 01:07:24.919
<i>This could be a win-win.</i>

1133
01:07:24.921 --> 01:07:27.736
<i>Assemble her a team.
Give her the requested assets.</i>

1134
01:07:27.738 --> 01:07:31.576
<i>If she's right, it's gonna
all clean up quite nicely.</i>

1135
01:07:31.578 --> 01:07:35.610
<i>Like I said, I want this mess
scrubbed and sanitized.</i>

1136
01:07:37.242 --> 01:07:38.650
And if she's wrong?

1137
01:07:40.633 --> 01:07:42.489
<i>Then nothing's gonna matter,
anyway.</i>

1138
01:07:43.705 --> 01:07:44.953
We're all screwed.

1139
01:07:46.905 --> 01:07:48.759
<i>The professor's been
informed of your arrival.</i>

1140
01:07:48.761 --> 01:07:50.967
We'll send in exact coordinates.

1141
01:07:50.969 --> 01:07:52.311
Hey, we're counting on you
to make sure

1142
01:07:52.313 --> 01:07:55.127
that payload
reaches her safely, huh?

1143
01:07:55.129 --> 01:07:56.890
Roger that. I'm on it, sir.

1144
01:08:37.337 --> 01:08:38.778
It's coming closer.

1145
01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:40.729
Kate.

1146
01:08:46.872 --> 01:08:48.633
Well, it's safe for now.

1147
01:08:50.393 --> 01:08:52.471
A few more tremors,
I don't know.

1148
01:08:52.473 --> 01:08:54.265
The whole place feels like
it's gonna come down.

1149
01:08:55.961 --> 01:08:58.201
A few more quakes and
the whole place will come down.

1150
01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:02.775
We're not even sure
this thing's gonna show up.

1151
01:09:02.777 --> 01:09:03.991
I really don't
wanna be here anymore.

1152
01:09:13.369 --> 01:09:15.286
That answers our question.

1153
01:09:15.288 --> 01:09:16.599
That plan B?

1154
01:09:16.601 --> 01:09:18.010
Let's hope so.

1155
01:09:22.968 --> 01:09:24.952
What are you doing?

1156
01:09:24.953 --> 01:09:27.194
Penny! Penny!

1157
01:09:29.784 --> 01:09:31.063
Hey, are you okay?

1158
01:09:31.064 --> 01:09:32.985
What did they do to you? Hey!

1159
01:09:36.056 --> 01:09:38.615
Stop. Come on,
you can't do this.

1160
01:09:38.617 --> 01:09:40.474
You can't do this.

1161
01:09:42.105 --> 01:09:44.086
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1162
01:09:44.088 --> 01:09:47.095
No, no, no. You can't. Come on.

1163
01:09:47.097 --> 01:09:49.271
- Stop.
- Sorry. Loose ends.

1164
01:09:49.273 --> 01:09:51.415
No!

1165
01:09:55.193 --> 01:09:56.888
Didn't think I'd
see you again so soon.

1166
01:09:56.889 --> 01:09:58.966
That's good luck.
Started in the desert.

1167
01:09:58.968 --> 01:10:00.631
Hopefully it'll end right here.

1168
01:10:00.633 --> 01:10:01.751
I like the sound of that.

1169
01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:07.734
- Where are they going?
- Protocol.

1170
01:10:07.736 --> 01:10:10.966
They'll be back with the evac
at the scheduled time.

1171
01:10:10.968 --> 01:10:12.247
They better be.

1172
01:10:12.249 --> 01:10:14.906
That's Jameson,
our bomb tech, as ordered.

1173
01:10:18.201 --> 01:10:20.855
I hope you guys
know what you're doing.

1174
01:10:20.857 --> 01:10:23.382
So you have a nuclear bomb
inside that thing?

1175
01:10:23.384 --> 01:10:24.886
Yeah, it's a one SADM.

1176
01:10:24.888 --> 01:10:26.839
Special Atomic
Demolition Munitions.

1177
01:10:26.841 --> 01:10:29.432
It's capable of one kiloton
detonation.

1178
01:10:29.434 --> 01:10:32.086
Ma'am, I was told you're the one
with the where and when.

1179
01:10:32.088 --> 01:10:33.430
You're gonna do down
about a mile down in there

1180
01:10:33.432 --> 01:10:35.126
and we are running out
of time...

1181
01:10:35.128 --> 01:10:36.822
Whoa. We can't go down there
a mile in that thing

1182
01:10:36.824 --> 01:10:39.063
for a remote detonation.

1183
01:10:39.065 --> 01:10:41.686
I'm assuming that we're not
all going down there.

1184
01:10:41.688 --> 01:10:43.063
No, they're staying here.

1185
01:10:43.065 --> 01:10:44.695
Here.

1186
01:10:44.697 --> 01:10:46.842
Relax. Be right back.

1187
01:10:49.656 --> 01:10:51.255
Look, I know it's cliché, kid.

1188
01:10:51.257 --> 01:10:54.071
Just push the red button, okay?

1189
01:10:54.073 --> 01:10:55.254
Push the red button.

1190
01:10:55.256 --> 01:10:56.982
I'm not pressing anything.

1191
01:10:56.984 --> 01:10:58.519
No, you have to, sweetie.

1192
01:10:58.521 --> 01:11:01.271
Look, kid, it's not gonna
detonate anything.

1193
01:11:01.273 --> 01:11:02.903
I-it's just gonna set off
the timer.

1194
01:11:02.905 --> 01:11:04.886
You'll be alright.
You can do it.

1195
01:11:04.888 --> 01:11:06.999
- I can't do this.
- Hey, look.

1196
01:11:07.001 --> 01:11:08.695
This isn't you
painting yourself green

1197
01:11:08.697 --> 01:11:09.911
and starting
some political statement.

1198
01:11:09.913 --> 01:11:11.894
- You know about that?
- I do.

1199
01:11:11.896 --> 01:11:14.231
And I'm proud of you,
and I know you don't know that.

1200
01:11:14.233 --> 01:11:16.407
And I need to do
a lot of things differently

1201
01:11:16.409 --> 01:11:18.582
but right now,
this is a sacrifice

1202
01:11:18.584 --> 01:11:19.639
and I need you to be strong.

1203
01:11:19.641 --> 01:11:21.335
Can you do that?

1204
01:11:21.337 --> 01:11:24.152
- Yes.
- Okay.

1205
01:11:24.154 --> 01:11:26.394
Mom? I love you.

1206
01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:31.127
I hate to be the one
to break this up

1207
01:11:31.129 --> 01:11:32.122
but we gotta go.

1208
01:11:34.392 --> 01:11:36.791
Hold that thought, okay?

1209
01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:39.226
You can do this. I love you.

1210
01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:48.729
Man, I really hope this works.

1211
01:11:52.089 --> 01:11:54.902
- Everybody okay?
- Yeah. Let's go.

1212
01:11:54.904 --> 01:11:56.122
- Go, go.
- Go.

1213
01:12:00.633 --> 01:12:03.447
<i>We do not know
the full extent of damage.</i>

1214
01:12:03.449 --> 01:12:05.242
<i>Reports of a sixth major...</i>

1215
01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:14.233
We're running out of time.

1216
01:12:16.344 --> 01:12:19.480
Base to Bird.
Base to Bird.

1217
01:12:19.481 --> 01:12:20.922
Come in. Over.

1218
01:12:24.792 --> 01:12:27.833
Base to Bird. Base to Bird.
Come in, Bird!

1219
01:12:29.336 --> 01:12:30.999
This is Bird, sir.

1220
01:12:31.001 --> 01:12:33.399
I am still in a holding pattern
above the fault line.

1221
01:12:33.401 --> 01:12:35.479
<i>Jameson has the package,
en route.</i>

1222
01:12:35.481 --> 01:12:37.434
<i>But the entire area
is unstable, sir.</i>

1223
01:12:39.096 --> 01:12:40.313
Copy that.

1224
01:12:42.008 --> 01:12:43.672
Three hours and counting, sir.

1225
01:12:51.289 --> 01:12:53.335
Come on, man. Keep moving.
Keep moving.

1226
01:12:53.337 --> 01:12:55.158
Yeah, yeah.

1227
01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:57.081
I say we go over
to my house. Let's go.

1228
01:13:01.337 --> 01:13:02.842
Right there.

1229
01:13:08.025 --> 01:13:10.871
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

1230
01:13:10.873 --> 01:13:12.054
I could activate the bomb

1231
01:13:12.056 --> 01:13:13.562
but you're gonna have to
tell me when.

1232
01:13:33.017 --> 01:13:36.314
Wait, wait, it's close.
Just hold on.

1233
01:13:37.272 --> 01:13:40.246
We are primed and ready.

1234
01:13:40.248 --> 01:13:41.750
No, not yet, it has to be
at the exact time

1235
01:13:41.752 --> 01:13:43.286
or this whole thing
is worthless.

1236
01:13:43.288 --> 01:13:44.566
Yeah, well, if we
don't detonate soon

1237
01:13:44.568 --> 01:13:46.839
we're all gonna be worthless.

1238
01:13:46.841 --> 01:13:49.143
Hope you're right
about those calculations, doc.

1239
01:13:49.145 --> 01:13:51.190
She is.

1240
01:13:53.849 --> 01:13:56.118
<i>Base to Bird. Come in. Over.</i>

1241
01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:59.414
<i>This is Bird. I've
got explosions all around me.</i>

1242
01:14:02.233 --> 01:14:03.322
Damn it!

1243
01:14:20.441 --> 01:14:22.871
I hate to break it to you guys,
but we got to go right now.

1244
01:14:22.873 --> 01:14:24.506
Kate?

1245
01:14:28.409 --> 01:14:31.095
Jessie, hit the button now.
Jessie, hit the button.

1246
01:14:31.097 --> 01:14:32.663
You have to hit it.
You heard her.

1247
01:14:32.665 --> 01:14:34.134
I can't leave them in there.
I can't.

1248
01:14:34.135 --> 01:14:35.862
- You have to.
- They're my family.

1249
01:14:35.864 --> 01:14:37.463
It's our orders,
and we need to follow them.

1250
01:14:37.465 --> 01:14:39.190
Jessie, they'll have time
to get out

1251
01:14:39.192 --> 01:14:40.374
but you have to start the timer.

1252
01:14:40.376 --> 01:14:42.039
It's gonna be okay.

1253
01:14:42.041 --> 01:14:43.514
Press the button.

1254
01:14:46.648 --> 01:14:48.409
Jessie, you can do this.

1255
01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:52.185
Come on.

1256
01:14:55.224 --> 01:14:57.879
- She did it.
- Let's go.

1257
01:14:57.881 --> 01:14:59.737
The new
detonation's been set, sir.

1258
01:15:04.729 --> 01:15:06.838
Alright, let's get out of here.

1259
01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:07.926
You're not going anywhere.

1260
01:15:07.928 --> 01:15:09.111
What are you doing?

1261
01:15:09.113 --> 01:15:10.809
Just following orders.

1262
01:15:19.289 --> 01:15:21.430
No! No!

1263
01:15:25.177 --> 01:15:26.841
Traitor.

1264
01:15:28.728 --> 01:15:30.007
Come on guys, we got to go.

1265
01:15:31.672 --> 01:15:33.974
Alright? We don't have a choice.

1266
01:15:33.976 --> 01:15:35.639
We gotta get out of here.

1267
01:15:36.728 --> 01:15:38.199
I can't leave them.

1268
01:15:38.201 --> 01:15:39.735
We have to get to
the helicopter.

1269
01:15:43.288 --> 01:15:44.441
Let's go, come on.

1270
01:15:45.336 --> 01:15:46.870
Come on.

1271
01:15:46.872 --> 01:15:48.439
Go. We have to go.

1272
01:15:48.441 --> 01:15:50.390
Come on. Let's go.

1273
01:15:50.392 --> 01:15:51.736
Mom.

1274
01:15:54.713 --> 01:15:56.154
There's no evac!

1275
01:15:58.808 --> 01:16:01.845
I don't see a helicopter.

1276
01:16:01.847 --> 01:16:03.351
They said they were coming back.

1277
01:16:03.353 --> 01:16:05.114
Do you see a helicopter?

1278
01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:09.975
No. No, they left us!

1279
01:16:09.977 --> 01:16:10.906
Ah!

1280
01:16:11.385 --> 01:16:12.535
Ah!

1281
01:16:12.537 --> 01:16:13.657
- Ah...
- Come on.

1282
01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:31.129
That's big.

1283
01:16:42.808 --> 01:16:44.759
That's it. That's the exit.
Go! Go!

1284
01:16:50.489 --> 01:16:53.238
Mom! Dad!

1285
01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:55.638
- Dad! Mom! Dad!
- Jessie! No!

1286
01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:56.695
- Jessie!
- No, Mom.

1287
01:16:56.697 --> 01:16:58.870
We gotta go. We have to go.

1288
01:16:58.872 --> 01:17:00.086
- Dad!
- Come on.

1289
01:17:00.088 --> 01:17:01.270
Mom!

1290
01:17:01.272 --> 01:17:04.022
Jake, let me go!

1291
01:17:04.024 --> 01:17:05.657
Mom!

1292
01:17:08.217 --> 01:17:09.942
What happened to the helicopter?

1293
01:17:09.944 --> 01:17:12.951
There is no helicopter.
It was a set-up.

1294
01:17:12.953 --> 01:17:15.352
Get to the truck.
Get to the truck.

1295
01:17:21.368 --> 01:17:23.032
Everybody hang on!

1296
01:17:52.856 --> 01:17:54.042
No!

1297
01:17:57.849 --> 01:17:59.030
Faster! We're running
out of time!

1298
01:17:59.032 --> 01:18:00.663
We're not clear
of the blast radius.

1299
01:18:00.665 --> 01:18:01.815
Come on, come on!

1300
01:18:01.817 --> 01:18:03.318
How do we know
when we are clear?

1301
01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.815
- When we're not dead. Move!
- I'm moving!

1302
01:18:10.233 --> 01:18:11.896
Go!

1303
01:18:16.185 --> 01:18:17.625
How much time do we have?

1304
01:18:20.087 --> 01:18:21.529
None!

1305
01:19:46.425 --> 01:19:49.815
- So, is it over?
- Yeah.

1306
01:19:49.817 --> 01:19:51.129
It's over.

1307
01:19:54.008 --> 01:19:55.576
How do you know?

1308
01:19:57.177 --> 01:19:59.829
Well, 'cause she has
this nasty habit

1309
01:19:59.831 --> 01:20:01.625
of always being right.

1310
01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:05.081
Not about everything.

1311
01:20:07.063 --> 01:20:08.566
You okay, doc.

1312
01:20:08.568 --> 01:20:10.874
Our country could use
more people like you.

1313
01:20:13.305 --> 01:20:15.289
I think she made her sacrifice.

1314
01:20:17.145 --> 01:20:18.617
I think we all did.

1315
01:20:24.887 --> 01:20:26.297
It's time to go.

1316
01:20:27.384 --> 01:20:29.815
Hey, professor?

1317
01:20:29.817 --> 01:20:31.481
Am I going to get
extra credit for this?

1318
01:20:33.209 --> 01:20:35.449
Right. Never mind.
I'll ask, I'll ask you later.

1319
