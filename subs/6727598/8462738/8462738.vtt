1
00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:16.999
Target acquired
and entering hot zone.

2
00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:18.999
<i>Alpha Team is on standby.</i>

3
00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.999
Roger that. On position.

4
00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:23.999
Awaiting visual confirmation.

5
00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.999
<i>Is the package on board?</i>

6
00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.999
<i>That's affirmative.</i>

7
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.999
<i>Package is on board. I repeat,</i>

8
00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.999
<i>package is on board.</i>

9
00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:38.999
Where are you taking us?
Where are we going?

10
00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.999
Please,
you don't have to do this.

11
00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:42.999
You don't understand
how dangerous this is.

12
00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:01.999
<i>I have visual confirmation.</i>
<i>Alpha Team, be ready on my mark.</i>

13
00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.999
Waiting for your command.

14
00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:13.999
<i>Target is down.</i>
<i>Execute! Execute! Execute!</i>

15
00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:15.999
Alpha Team is inbound.

16
00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:17.999
Move out! Let's go, brother!

17
00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:19.999
Come from the back!

18
00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:26.999
Let's go!

19
00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:46.999
Why are we stopping?
What's happening?

20
00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:47.999
Shut up! Stay down.

21
00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:09.999
Why are they shooting?
What is happening?

22
00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:11.999
I said stay down!

23
00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:24.999
I'm taking directed fire.
Hurry the hell up.

24
00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:25.999
Who did you call?

25
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.999
I didn't call anyone. I swear.

26
00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:28.999
Put your hands up.

27
00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:43.999
Turn on the weapon. Now!

28
00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:44.999
No, you don't understand.

29
00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:46.999
Those men that are shooting
your men outside are...

30
00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:48.999
...not gonna let you
turn this on.

31
00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:49.999
You need to stop this now.

32
00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:51.999
Do it! Now.

33
00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:55.999
Do it now! Now!

34
00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:11.999
Now! I said, now!

35
00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:14.999
Do it.

36
00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:20.999
Do it now! Do it.

37
00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.999
Uh!

38
00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.999
Do it!

39
00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:54.999
I'm not turning this on.
You gonna have to shoot me.

40
00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:58.999
What are you doing, Kate?
This is crazy.

41
00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.999
Just do what he says.

42
00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:02.999
-You!
-Turn it on.

43
00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:03.999
-I... I don't know how.
-Do it!

44
00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:05.999
I've only watched her run this.

45
00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:07.999
I said, do it now!

46
00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.999
-Okay! Okay! Okay!
-Do it!

47
00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:14.999
-Don't do this.
-You shut up!

48
00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:23.999
Don't do this.

49
00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:24.999
-I have to.
-Shut up.

50
00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:27.999
-Do it.
-I'm sorry.

51
00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:29.999
Now! Do it.

52
00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:31.999
I think that's it.

53
00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:44.999
-You don't have to do this.
-Shut up!

54
00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:48.999
I'm sorry.

55
00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:53.999
It's armed.

56
00:05:57.999 --> 00:05:59.999
Ah!

57
00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:11.999
Uh!

58
00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:14.999
Kate! Come on, let's go.

59
00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:15.999
No, I've got to deactivate
this thing.

60
00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:17.999
Let's go. Let's go.

61
00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:19.999
Let's go. We gotta go right now.

62
00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:20.999
It's been activated.
I have to stop it...

63
00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:22.999
No, we have go right now.

64
00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:24.999
No, I have to shut it down.

65
00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:30.999
Come on, let's go.

66
00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:32.999
What the hell is that thing?

67
00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:33.999
Ah!

68
00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:36.999
Let's go!

69
00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:42.999
Ah!

70
00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:53.000
We gotta go!

71
00:06:58.999 --> 00:06:59.999
Ah!

72
00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:17.999
<i>We're taking heavy fire.</i>
<i>Request evac at this location.</i>

73
00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:20.999
<i>I need all ordnance</i>
<i>on my pod right now.</i>

74
00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:24.999
Go!

75
00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:43.999
<i>Cleared hot. Fire for effect.</i>
<i>Fire! Fire! Fire!</i>

76
00:08:07.999 --> 00:08:08.999
<i>All stop, all stop.</i>

77
00:08:20.999 --> 00:08:22.999
This is India zero two.
The hostage has been recovered.

78
00:08:22.999 --> 00:08:25.999
We're returning to base
at this time. Over.

79
00:08:25.999 --> 00:08:26.999
<i>Copy that. The weapon?</i>

80
00:08:27.999 --> 00:08:28.999
The weapon's been destroyed.

81
00:08:29.999 --> 00:08:30.999
No, it hasn't.

82
00:08:31.999 --> 00:08:32.999
It's just beginning.

83
00:09:27.999 --> 00:09:30.999
So, professor, what exactly
are you hoping to find?

84
00:09:30.999 --> 00:09:32.999
Anomalies between the two sets
of data would be great.

85
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.999
I mean, comparing readings
from this close to the fault...

86
00:09:35.999 --> 00:09:37.999
...with the ones we've collected,
would be invaluable.

87
00:09:37.999 --> 00:09:38.999
Ideally it's gonna help us
make sense of...

88
00:09:38.999 --> 00:09:39.999
...all the data we've collected.

89
00:09:40.999 --> 00:09:41.999
I mean, really anything
that might help...

90
00:09:41.999 --> 00:09:43.999
...give us some answers, Jake.

91
00:09:47.999 --> 00:09:48.999
Here we are, guys.

92
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.999
Oh-huh! It's beautiful, huh?

93
00:10:09.999 --> 00:10:10.999
Yeah.

94
00:10:11.999 --> 00:10:12.999
Yeah, not exactly
what I was thinking.

95
00:10:14.999 --> 00:10:15.999
Well, if you were thinking,

96
00:10:15.999 --> 00:10:17.999
then you wouldn't be
spending your spring break...

97
00:10:17.999 --> 00:10:18.000
...with your father, would you?

98
00:10:19.999 --> 00:10:21.999
How many time
do I have to tell you?

99
00:10:21.999 --> 00:10:23.000
It was a political statement.

100
00:10:23.999 --> 00:10:24.999
Yeah, well,
your political statement...

101
00:10:24.999 --> 00:10:27.999
...nearly cost me my job
and almost got you expelled.

102
00:10:29.999 --> 00:10:30.999
You know, sometimes
I think you do those things...

103
00:10:30.999 --> 00:10:32.999
...just to get back
at your mother and I.

104
00:10:35.999 --> 00:10:37.999
Judging from your silence,
I'm gonna take it that I'm right.

105
00:10:37.999 --> 00:10:38.999
I'm an adult.

106
00:10:39.999 --> 00:10:41.999
Yours and Mom's problems
have nothing to do with it.

107
00:10:41.999 --> 00:10:42.999
So don't make it about that.

108
00:10:44.999 --> 00:10:47.999
Okay, Miss Political Statement.

109
00:10:47.999 --> 00:10:48.000
There is a phrase...

110
00:10:49.999 --> 00:10:51.999
"If you can't do the time,
don't do the crime."

111
00:10:53.999 --> 00:10:55.999
Look, it's gonna be
a long couple days...

112
00:10:55.999 --> 00:10:57.000
...if you don't start
looking at the bright side.

113
00:10:57.999 --> 00:10:58.999
There's a bright side?

114
00:10:58.999 --> 00:10:59.999
Yeah! Uh, I still have a job.

115
00:10:59.999 --> 00:11:02.999
And you still get to
go to school, tuition free.

116
00:11:04.999 --> 00:11:07.999
Sorry,
I didn't mean it to go that far.

117
00:11:08.999 --> 00:11:09.999
I know.

118
00:11:11.999 --> 00:11:15.999
Hey, professor, which of these
goes inside the ranger station?

119
00:11:17.999 --> 00:11:19.999
And you get to spend time
with that guy.

120
00:11:20.999 --> 00:11:21.999
I don't know, Jake.

121
00:11:22.999 --> 00:11:24.999
How about starting with the ones
labeled Ranger Station?

122
00:11:27.999 --> 00:11:28.999
Right.

123
00:11:30.999 --> 00:11:31.999
-Got it!
-Hello!

124
00:11:32.999 --> 00:11:33.999
Is that Mom? Is she back?

125
00:11:36.999 --> 00:11:38.999
You know what, thank you
very much, I'm good.

126
00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:40.999
Bye.

127
00:11:40.999 --> 00:11:41.999
I guess that wasn't Mom.

128
00:11:42.999 --> 00:11:44.999
No. Somebody trying to sell
me steak knives, so I'm guess...

129
00:11:44.999 --> 00:11:46.999
You told me she would be
home a week ago.

130
00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:48.999
She's back.

131
00:11:48.999 --> 00:11:51.999
She had some bureaucratic things
to take care of.

132
00:11:52.999 --> 00:11:53.999
What else did
she get herself into?

133
00:11:53.999 --> 00:11:54.999
-Rob!
-Harris!

134
00:11:55.999 --> 00:11:57.999
-Hey!
-Hey! Long time.

135
00:11:57.999 --> 00:11:58.999
How are you, Martin?

136
00:11:58.999 --> 00:12:00.999
-This is my daughter Jessie.
-Hey!

137
00:12:01.999 --> 00:12:03.999
-Hi!
-I've heard a lot about you.

138
00:12:03.999 --> 00:12:03.999
It's good to finally meet.

139
00:12:05.999 --> 00:12:07.999
Wow! She looks like Kate.

140
00:12:08.999 --> 00:12:10.999
-Heh heh. It's a good thing.
-Thanks.

141
00:12:11.999 --> 00:12:13.999
Speaking of, how is Kate?
I haven't seen her in forever.

142
00:12:14.999 --> 00:12:15.999
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.

143
00:12:19.999 --> 00:12:20.999
I say something wrong?

144
00:12:20.999 --> 00:12:22.999
Just, uh, it's a touchy subject.

145
00:12:22.999 --> 00:12:23.999
Oh, the divorce.

146
00:12:25.999 --> 00:12:27.999
Yeah, anyway, uh, so,
let's talk about this stuff.

147
00:12:27.999 --> 00:12:28.999
What's goin' on?

148
00:12:28.999 --> 00:12:30.999
I'm sure as heck glad
you're here, Rob.

149
00:12:31.999 --> 00:12:33.999
If I'm reading that equipment
correctly that you sent me...

150
00:12:33.999 --> 00:12:36.999
There's a crazy amount of seismic
activity all over the fault line.

151
00:12:36.999 --> 00:12:38.999
Looks like a popcorn machine.

152
00:12:39.999 --> 00:12:40.999
I wanna be wrong, but...

153
00:12:40.999 --> 00:12:42.999
...all this activity is...

154
00:12:43.999 --> 00:12:44.999
I got a bad feeling.

155
00:12:46.999 --> 00:12:47.999
That's why I'm here.

156
00:12:47.999 --> 00:12:49.999
Yeah, we picked up
the same readings at university.

157
00:12:49.999 --> 00:12:50.999
Let's get inside
and see what you got.

158
00:12:50.999 --> 00:12:52.999
Sure! Lemme help you
with the equipment.

159
00:13:00.999 --> 00:13:01.000
Hey...

160
00:13:01.999 --> 00:13:02.999
Don't worry about your mom okay?

161
00:13:03.999 --> 00:13:05.999
She's gonna be fine.
She always is.

162
00:13:06.999 --> 00:13:08.999
Worrying about her
and wanting to see her...

163
00:13:08.999 --> 00:13:09.999
...are two separate things.

164
00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:11.999
You seem to forget that.

165
00:13:28.999 --> 00:13:29.999
<i>The hostage has been recovered.</i>

166
00:13:29.999 --> 00:13:31.999
<i>We're returning to</i>
<i>base this time. Over.</i>

167
00:13:31.999 --> 00:13:33.999
<i>Copy that. The weapon?</i>

168
00:13:33.999 --> 00:13:35.999
<i>The weapon's been destroyed.</i>

169
00:13:35.999 --> 00:13:36.999
<i>No. it hasn't.</i>

170
00:13:37.999 --> 00:13:39.000
<i>It's just beginning.</i>

171
00:13:41.999 --> 00:13:43.999
Yes, I see here
we've received numerous...

172
00:13:43.999 --> 00:13:46.999
...phone calls and emails
warning of impending disasters.

173
00:13:46.999 --> 00:13:48.999
Is that what you were doing
over there in Yemen?

174
00:13:48.999 --> 00:13:50.999
Risking your life and
the lives of others...

175
00:13:50.999 --> 00:13:53.999
...to stop some crazy disaster?

176
00:13:54.999 --> 00:13:56.999
Sir, these crazy disasters
have already begun.

177
00:13:56.999 --> 00:13:58.999
Yes, I've, I've seen that.

178
00:13:58.999 --> 00:14:00.999
Uh, an earthquake in Yemen.

179
00:14:01.999 --> 00:14:02.999
A temblor in Qatar.

180
00:14:03.999 --> 00:14:04.999
Sandstorm in the desert.

181
00:14:06.999 --> 00:14:07.999
A sandstorm in the desert.

182
00:14:08.999 --> 00:14:10.999
That's not really an anomaly,
is it?

183
00:14:10.999 --> 00:14:12.999
The winds in the sandstorm
you're talking about...

184
00:14:12.999 --> 00:14:14.999
...were over several
hundred degrees.

185
00:14:14.999 --> 00:14:15.999
What's your intel on that?

186
00:14:16.999 --> 00:14:17.999
That's just the beginning.

187
00:14:17.999 --> 00:14:21.999
Global seismic activity is up 15%
since your team extracted me.

188
00:14:21.999 --> 00:14:23.999
15% and it's on the rise.

189
00:14:23.999 --> 00:14:25.999
The Hellstorm has
been initiated...

190
00:14:25.999 --> 00:14:28.999
There is no such thing
as a Hellstorm weapon.

191
00:14:29.999 --> 00:14:32.999
I am sitting here,
as proof otherwise.

192
00:14:33.999 --> 00:14:36.999
And this is your proof?

193
00:14:37.999 --> 00:14:39.999
Most of my research
was destroyed in the field.

194
00:14:39.999 --> 00:14:41.999
You are right, in the field.

195
00:14:42.999 --> 00:14:44.999
The field where our men,
good men,

196
00:14:44.999 --> 00:14:46.999
apart from saving your life...

197
00:14:46.999 --> 00:14:47.999
...took out
a terrorist weapon stash...

198
00:14:47.999 --> 00:14:49.999
...that was confirmed to
contain chemical weapons.

199
00:14:49.999 --> 00:14:52.000
Chemical wea... Is this a joke?

200
00:14:54.999 --> 00:14:57.999
Miss, uh, doomsday scenarios
are nothing new to this office.

201
00:14:58.999 --> 00:15:00.999
Russia's getting squirly
with her nukes.

202
00:15:00.999 --> 00:15:02.999
ISIS may or may not be
acquiring a dirty bomb.

203
00:15:02.999 --> 00:15:05.999
North Korea... Well,
forget about North Korea.

204
00:15:05.999 --> 00:15:06.999
But your scenario...

205
00:15:07.999 --> 00:15:09.999
Let's just call it what it is,
it's fantasy.

206
00:15:10.999 --> 00:15:13.999
Hellstorm weapons,
resonance weapons.

207
00:15:14.999 --> 00:15:16.999
This isn't fantasy, it's fact.
I have seen it.

208
00:15:18.999 --> 00:15:20.999
Yes, I've read your report,
I think we all have.

209
00:15:21.999 --> 00:15:24.999
Resonance as a weapon
is just a theory.

210
00:15:24.999 --> 00:15:26.999
Enough to know the difference
between fact and theory.

211
00:15:27.999 --> 00:15:28.999
We don't give credit
to outlandish...

212
00:15:28.999 --> 00:15:29.999
...theories here in this office.

213
00:15:29.999 --> 00:15:34.999
If we did we would have shut down
for the 2012 Mayan apocalypse.

214
00:15:34.999 --> 00:15:37.999
GMOs would have turned all of us
into zombies by now.

215
00:15:37.999 --> 00:15:39.999
I'd even turn off
my laptop for Y2K.

216
00:15:40.999 --> 00:15:42.999
The point is, whatever was
in that desert was destroyed.

217
00:15:42.999 --> 00:15:44.999
It isn't destroyed!
It's activated!

218
00:15:44.999 --> 00:15:47.999
The only thing your bombs did
was make it harder to turn off!

219
00:15:47.999 --> 00:15:50.999
There are some very smart men
in the middle of that desert...

220
00:15:50.999 --> 00:15:51.999
...who have figured out
a technology...

221
00:15:51.999 --> 00:15:54.999
...that makes it capable of
wiping out an entire village.

222
00:15:54.999 --> 00:15:56.999
So I would gratefully
appreciate this office's help...

223
00:15:56.999 --> 00:16:00.999
Whatever you think was
or was not in that desert...

224
00:16:00.999 --> 00:16:01.999
...was taken out
by a team of men...

225
00:16:01.999 --> 00:16:04.999
...who also risked
their lives to save yours.

226
00:16:05.999 --> 00:16:09.999
So... What we'd
appreciate from you...

227
00:16:09.999 --> 00:16:10.999
...is a little bit of gratitude.

228
00:16:13.999 --> 00:16:14.999
This meeting's over.

229
00:16:14.999 --> 00:16:15.999
Uh... "Over?"

230
00:16:16.999 --> 00:16:17.999
Why am I here?

231
00:16:17.999 --> 00:16:19.999
I said, this meeting is over.

232
00:16:22.999 --> 00:16:25.999
This meeting might be over,
but mark my words this,

233
00:16:26.999 --> 00:16:27.999
this has just begun.

234
00:16:35.999 --> 00:16:37.999
Where are the seats for the tent?

235
00:16:38.999 --> 00:16:40.999
-Babe.
-Babe, uh, where's my toolbox?

236
00:16:41.999 --> 00:16:42.999
I don't know.
I thought you packed it.

237
00:16:43.999 --> 00:16:44.999
I told you to pack it.

238
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.999
Why would I pack your toolbox?

239
00:16:47.999 --> 00:16:48.999
Because I asked you to.

240
00:16:48.999 --> 00:16:49.999
Yes. And I told you I couldn't...

241
00:16:49.999 --> 00:16:51.999
'cause I had to pack
the groceries.

242
00:16:52.999 --> 00:16:53.999
So you didn't pack it?

243
00:16:55.999 --> 00:16:56.999
I packed groceries.

244
00:17:00.999 --> 00:17:02.999
Seriously,
do you ever listen to me?

245
00:17:03.999 --> 00:17:04.999
Clearly not, 'cause if you did...

246
00:17:04.999 --> 00:17:05.999
...you'd have a toolbox,
wouldn't ya?

247
00:17:18.999 --> 00:17:19.999
Oh!

248
00:17:22.999 --> 00:17:24.999
Oh, my God, babe!
Are you seeing this?

249
00:17:27.999 --> 00:17:29.999
Run! Run!

250
00:17:30.999 --> 00:17:32.999
Oh! Oh!

251
00:17:33.999 --> 00:17:34.999
Oh, no!

252
00:17:42.999 --> 00:17:44.000
Rob, you're gonna wanna see this.

253
00:17:47.999 --> 00:17:48.999
That's the second one today.

254
00:17:49.999 --> 00:17:50.999
South Ridge.

255
00:17:51.999 --> 00:17:54.999
Not really an alarming size,
it's barely registering.

256
00:17:54.999 --> 00:17:56.999
No, but it, it's not the size
that's of concern...

257
00:17:56.999 --> 00:17:58.999
...it's the frequency.
Have you been mapping these?

258
00:17:58.999 --> 00:18:00.999
Yeah, every single one of 'em,
like you told me to.

259
00:18:01.999 --> 00:18:03.999
See, it's not the size.

260
00:18:03.999 --> 00:18:04.999
Would you grow up?

261
00:18:05.999 --> 00:18:08.999
Yeah, the, uh, pins are tagged
with size, duration and time.

262
00:18:10.999 --> 00:18:11.999
So, what's that supposed to mean?

263
00:18:11.999 --> 00:18:13.999
Is California getting ready
for the big one?

264
00:18:13.999 --> 00:18:14.999
Well, it shouldn't be.

265
00:18:14.999 --> 00:18:16.999
See, normally,
this kind of activity...

266
00:18:16.999 --> 00:18:17.999
...would be a good thing...

267
00:18:17.999 --> 00:18:19.999
...to release the stress
along the fault line. But...

268
00:18:19.999 --> 00:18:22.000
But then the seismic activity
would be decelerating, right?

269
00:18:22.999 --> 00:18:24.999
Exactly, but here
it's accelerating.

270
00:18:25.999 --> 00:18:26.999
You've been paying attention.

271
00:18:27.999 --> 00:18:28.999
What is that?

272
00:18:28.999 --> 00:18:30.000
-Another one.
-Something's comin' in.

273
00:18:38.999 --> 00:18:40.999
Okay, professor,
that didn't feel small.

274
00:18:41.999 --> 00:18:43.999
No, it didn't.

275
00:18:45.999 --> 00:18:47.999
Ranger Station 219,
go for Martin.

276
00:18:51.999 --> 00:18:52.999
Alright, copy that.

277
00:18:55.999 --> 00:18:57.999
I got an emergency.
You should come with me.

278
00:18:59.999 --> 00:19:00.999
Okay. Uh...

279
00:19:01.999 --> 00:19:03.999
You guys stay here and
finish set up the equipment.

280
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.999
Stay here?

281
00:19:09.999 --> 00:19:11.999
It's just a tremor.
We should be fine.

282
00:19:49.999 --> 00:19:50.999
Can we talk?

283
00:19:54.999 --> 00:19:55.999
I can't believe
you were out there.

284
00:19:55.999 --> 00:19:57.999
I can't believe
you went to Yemen.

285
00:19:57.999 --> 00:19:58.999
Who are you?

286
00:19:58.999 --> 00:19:59.999
I mean, you saw it, right?
You saw the weapon.

287
00:19:59.999 --> 00:20:01.999
Was it, was it operational?

288
00:20:03.999 --> 00:20:05.999
Sorry, my parents always said
that I was very short on tact.

289
00:20:05.999 --> 00:20:07.999
-Drew. Drew Slack.
-Wait. What do you know?

290
00:20:07.999 --> 00:20:09.999
Why didn't you say
anything in there?

291
00:20:09.999 --> 00:20:10.999
Off the record?

292
00:20:10.999 --> 00:20:11.999
Not a reporter.

293
00:20:12.999 --> 00:20:13.999
Your car's not bugged, is it?

294
00:20:13.999 --> 00:20:14.999
What?

295
00:20:14.999 --> 00:20:15.999
Okay.

296
00:20:16.999 --> 00:20:17.999
I was part of the crew
that hacked the files.

297
00:20:18.999 --> 00:20:20.999
We dumped the info out there,
th, the files that you got...

298
00:20:21.999 --> 00:20:22.999
Files that sent you to Yemen.

299
00:20:22.999 --> 00:20:23.999
No. Wait! Slow down.
That was you?

300
00:20:24.999 --> 00:20:26.999
Well, me and some
anonymous friends.

301
00:20:26.999 --> 00:20:27.999
That's treason.

302
00:20:27.999 --> 00:20:29.999
Uh, okay. I'm acutely
aware of that, but...

303
00:20:29.999 --> 00:20:31.999
I don't see it that way. See,
okay, because if you're right...

304
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.999
...which I think that you are
then it's the men in those...

305
00:20:33.999 --> 00:20:35.999
...rooms that's the real
treasonous ones.

306
00:20:35.999 --> 00:20:38.999
Okay, they know, Kate.
Keegan, Pierce.

307
00:20:38.999 --> 00:20:40.999
They know that Hellstorm exists.

308
00:20:40.999 --> 00:20:41.999
They're lying to you.

309
00:20:41.999 --> 00:20:43.000
Why... Why lie?

310
00:20:43.999 --> 00:20:44.999
Because it's their technology...

311
00:20:44.999 --> 00:20:45.999
...that got stolen
in the first place.

312
00:20:45.999 --> 00:20:46.999
Sensitive government information.

313
00:20:46.999 --> 00:20:48.999
How do you think
that's gonna look?

314
00:20:49.999 --> 00:20:51.999
Thing is, they're confident
they destroyed it.

315
00:20:51.999 --> 00:20:53.999
Yeah, well, they're wrong,
we've got to get back in there.

316
00:20:53.999 --> 00:20:55.999
Wait, wait, are you kidding me?
You can't go back in there.

317
00:20:55.999 --> 00:20:57.999
They'll have you locked up before
you can say anything. Or worse.

318
00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:58.999
Worse?

319
00:20:59.999 --> 00:21:00.999
This division of government
doesn't exactly...

320
00:21:00.999 --> 00:21:02.999
...answer to a whole of people,
if you get what I'm saying.

321
00:21:04.999 --> 00:21:05.999
Okay...

322
00:21:05.999 --> 00:21:07.999
How sure are you
that it's operational?

323
00:21:07.999 --> 00:21:08.999
I was there.

324
00:21:09.999 --> 00:21:10.999
I saw it. It is.

325
00:21:10.999 --> 00:21:12.999
This is so bad.

326
00:21:13.999 --> 00:21:14.999
Oh, this is so bad.

327
00:21:14.999 --> 00:21:17.000
Okay, Drew, listen...

328
00:21:17.999 --> 00:21:19.999
I need your help.
I have to get out of here.

329
00:21:19.999 --> 00:21:22.999
But I need you to get
my files, they have them.

330
00:21:22.999 --> 00:21:23.999
I need them.

331
00:21:24.999 --> 00:21:26.999
You can do this,
go get me my files.

332
00:21:26.999 --> 00:21:27.999
Yeah, I'm going to jail,
I'm definitely going to jail.

333
00:21:27.999 --> 00:21:29.999
You're gonna be a hero.

334
00:21:29.999 --> 00:21:31.999
Nelson Mandela was a hero and
he went to jail for 27 years...

335
00:21:31.999 --> 00:21:33.000
Drew,
thousands of innocent people...

336
00:21:33.999 --> 00:21:35.999
...are going to lose
their lives, maybe more...

337
00:21:35.999 --> 00:21:36.999
Oh!

338
00:21:42.999 --> 00:21:43.999
Fine.

339
00:21:45.999 --> 00:21:46.999
I'll do it.

340
00:21:46.999 --> 00:21:47.999
Where are you going?

341
00:21:47.999 --> 00:21:49.999
San Andreas fault.

342
00:21:49.999 --> 00:21:50.999
Is there a problem there, too?

343
00:21:51.999 --> 00:21:52.999
There's gonna be
a problem everywhere.

344
00:21:52.999 --> 00:21:53.999
Go get me the info.

345
00:21:55.999 --> 00:21:56.999
Got it.

346
00:22:01.999 --> 00:22:03.999
Come on, Rob.

347
00:22:34.999 --> 00:22:36.999
Oh, Rob, this does not look good.

348
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Man, what happened here?

349
00:22:49.999 --> 00:22:50.999
What is this?

350
00:22:55.999 --> 00:22:56.999
Oh, no.

351
00:23:00.999 --> 00:23:01.999
I knew these people.

352
00:23:02.999 --> 00:23:03.999
Uh...

353
00:23:05.999 --> 00:23:06.999
Look at that.

354
00:23:19.999 --> 00:23:20.999
Go!

355
00:23:25.999 --> 00:23:27.999
Let's go!

356
00:23:29.999 --> 00:23:30.999
Go!

357
00:23:44.999 --> 00:23:48.000
Look. It looks like there
was another seismic event.

358
00:23:48.999 --> 00:23:49.999
You know how to read that?

359
00:23:50.999 --> 00:23:52.999
You do know who
my parents are, right?

360
00:23:53.999 --> 00:23:54.999
Yeah, so,
why this sudden interest

361
00:23:54.999 --> 00:23:55.999
in what your father's doing?

362
00:23:55.999 --> 00:23:57.999
Thought you were going
on spring break.

363
00:23:57.999 --> 00:23:58.999
I was.

364
00:23:58.999 --> 00:24:01.999
I got in trouble for
a little political stunt.

365
00:24:01.999 --> 00:24:02.999
This is my punishment.

366
00:24:03.999 --> 00:24:05.999
I guess there was
a lot of that goin' on.

367
00:24:05.999 --> 00:24:07.999
I heard that there was
this group of people...

368
00:24:07.999 --> 00:24:09.999
...who painted
themselves green and...

369
00:24:09.999 --> 00:24:12.999
...went streaking across campus
to raise awareness for Earth Day.

370
00:24:13.999 --> 00:24:15.000
Thought that was kinda cool.

371
00:24:15.999 --> 00:24:17.999
Thanks.
My father didn't think so.

372
00:24:19.999 --> 00:24:20.999
Wait, that was you?

373
00:24:21.999 --> 00:24:24.999
Where am I when
all the cool stuff happens? Damn!

374
00:24:25.999 --> 00:24:26.999
Jake, it was for a cause.

375
00:24:26.999 --> 00:24:29.999
Oh, no, I get that. And
I support it, like, like wholly.

376
00:24:29.999 --> 00:24:30.999
Like, next time you do it,

377
00:24:30.999 --> 00:24:32.999
any time you want to do it
you just, you let me know...

378
00:24:32.999 --> 00:24:34.999
...and I'll be there,
you know, for the cause.

379
00:24:34.999 --> 00:24:36.999
-Jake...
-With a, with a paint brush.

380
00:24:36.999 --> 00:24:37.999
And paint...

381
00:24:37.999 --> 00:24:40.999
Jake, you remember
when we were in the car...

382
00:24:40.999 --> 00:24:41.999
...and you told me to tell you
when you were being...

383
00:24:41.999 --> 00:24:42.999
...awkward and uncomfortable?

384
00:24:42.999 --> 00:24:43.999
Yeah.

385
00:24:46.999 --> 00:24:47.999
I'm doing it right now, aren't I?

386
00:24:47.999 --> 00:24:49.999
Yeah, you're doin' it right now.

387
00:24:49.999 --> 00:24:52.999
I'm sorry. I just... I get
nervous when I'm around you.

388
00:24:54.999 --> 00:24:56.999
Whatever. Ahem.

389
00:24:58.999 --> 00:25:01.999
-We have internet.
-Oh, perfect.

390
00:25:10.999 --> 00:25:12.999
What? What? What?

391
00:25:13.999 --> 00:25:17.999
<i>Again, what we are seeing</i>
<i>is widespread destruction...</i>

392
00:25:17.999 --> 00:25:19.999
<i>-...that has consumed Paris.</i>
-Oh, my god.

393
00:25:20.999 --> 00:25:22.999
<i>Reports are coming in</i>
<i>from all...</i>

394
00:25:22.999 --> 00:25:24.999
-Is that the Eiffel Tower?
<i>-describing...</i>

395
00:25:24.999 --> 00:25:27.000
<i>-...huge earthquakes followed...</i>
-Yeah.

396
00:25:41.999 --> 00:25:42.999
Rob?

397
00:25:45.999 --> 00:25:46.999
Jess?

398
00:25:48.999 --> 00:25:51.999
<i>Massive storms</i>
<i>that have toppled...</i>

399
00:25:51.999 --> 00:25:52.999
Mom!

400
00:25:53.999 --> 00:25:55.999
My baby.

401
00:25:56.999 --> 00:26:00.999
<i>Survivors have described</i>
<i>a scene right out of hell...</i>

402
00:26:01.999 --> 00:26:03.000
<i>...with smoke, ash and debris...</i>

403
00:26:03.999 --> 00:26:05.999
<i>...raining down</i>
<i>over the entire city.</i>

404
00:26:26.999 --> 00:26:28.999
-Gotta get out of this park.
-I agree.

405
00:26:32.999 --> 00:26:33.999
Change of plans, guys.

406
00:26:33.999 --> 00:26:34.999
Pack up your stuff.
We're leaving.

407
00:26:35.999 --> 00:26:37.999
Kate, when'd you get here?

408
00:26:37.999 --> 00:26:39.999
<i>...definitely been described</i>
<i>as a natural disaster.</i>

409
00:26:39.999 --> 00:26:40.999
What are you guys looking on?

410
00:26:41.999 --> 00:26:43.999
<i>We can only assume</i>
<i>at this point...</i>

411
00:26:44.999 --> 00:26:47.999
<i>...that so many innocent people</i>
<i>are dead.</i>

412
00:26:47.999 --> 00:26:51.999
<i>And the damage is</i>
<i>in billions if not more.</i>

413
00:26:52.999 --> 00:26:56.999
<i>Emergency crews are</i>
<i>pouring through the rubble...</i>

414
00:26:56.999 --> 00:26:59.999
<i>...as scores of buildings</i>
<i>lay in ruins...</i>

415
00:26:59.999 --> 00:27:03.999
<i>...in the center of one of the</i>
<i>greatest cities in the world...</i>

416
00:27:03.999 --> 00:27:06.999
<i>...reeling now from the effects</i>
<i>of this catastrophe.</i>

417
00:27:13.999 --> 00:27:14.999
Don't take your eyes
off the screen.

418
00:27:14.999 --> 00:27:16.999
Let me know if anything changes.

419
00:27:24.999 --> 00:27:25.999
What time did
these readings come in?

420
00:27:29.999 --> 00:27:31.999
There's a major
at the front desk.

421
00:27:31.999 --> 00:27:32.999
Right.

422
00:28:34.999 --> 00:28:35.999
Hello?

423
00:28:35.999 --> 00:28:36.999
<i>Penny, it's Drew.</i>
<i>Do you have a second?</i>

424
00:28:36.999 --> 00:28:37.999
Are you watching the news?

425
00:28:37.999 --> 00:28:39.999
Did you see
what happened in France?

426
00:28:39.999 --> 00:28:41.999
<i>Do you know where I work?</i>
<i>Of course I know.</i>

427
00:28:42.999 --> 00:28:43.999
Why are you whispering?

428
00:28:44.999 --> 00:28:45.999
<i>Because</i>
<i>I just told you where I am.</i>

429
00:28:45.999 --> 00:28:47.999
And this call
isn't exactly legal.

430
00:28:48.999 --> 00:28:48.999
<i>Dude!</i>

431
00:28:49.999 --> 00:28:52.999
You are in a government building.
Go somewhere else.

432
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:53.999
<i>I can't.</i>

433
00:28:54.999 --> 00:28:55.999
I can't.
I don't have time to explain it.

434
00:28:55.999 --> 00:28:56.999
<i>Just need you to listen to me,</i>
<i>okay?</i>

435
00:29:03.999 --> 00:29:04.999
Oh, sh...

436
00:29:09.999 --> 00:29:10.999
Are you in a bathroom?

437
00:29:17.999 --> 00:29:18.999
Ohh.

438
00:29:23.999 --> 00:29:24.999
Oh, my God.

439
00:29:25.999 --> 00:29:26.999
Hmm?

440
00:29:29.999 --> 00:29:30.999
Ugh.

441
00:29:33.999 --> 00:29:34.999
Go.

442
00:29:38.999 --> 00:29:40.999
Oh... Sorry.

443
00:29:48.999 --> 00:29:49.999
Okay.

444
00:29:50.999 --> 00:29:53.999
<i>Sorry about that. Okay,</i>
<i>so, long story short.</i>

445
00:29:53.999 --> 00:29:57.999
I need to get to a server room,
and I can't get access...

446
00:29:57.999 --> 00:29:58.999
...unless there's
a critical network failure.

447
00:29:59.999 --> 00:30:00.999
Okay.

448
00:30:02.999 --> 00:30:03.999
I need a zip bomb.

449
00:30:04.999 --> 00:30:05.999
Are you kidding me?

450
00:30:06.999 --> 00:30:08.999
<i>No. I'm not kidding, okay?</i>

451
00:30:08.999 --> 00:30:09.999
I need a data dump...

452
00:30:09.999 --> 00:30:10.999
...so massive that
it clogs the servers...

453
00:30:10.999 --> 00:30:11.999
...and shuts everything down.

454
00:30:13.999 --> 00:30:14.999
Come on.

455
00:30:14.999 --> 00:30:17.999
<i>They're monitoring our activities</i>
<i>so I can't do it here.</i>

456
00:30:19.999 --> 00:30:21.999
Penny? Are you there?

457
00:30:22.999 --> 00:30:23.999
<i>Penny?</i>

458
00:30:24.999 --> 00:30:25.999
Is this treason?

459
00:30:25.999 --> 00:30:27.999
No, why does everybody
keep saying that?

460
00:30:28.999 --> 00:30:31.999
-'Cause it is.
<i>-Okay, no, it's not...</i>

461
00:30:31.999 --> 00:30:33.999
Technically, it is. But it's...

462
00:30:35.999 --> 00:30:36.999
<i>It's for a good cause,</i>
<i>I'm telling you.</i>

463
00:30:36.999 --> 00:30:38.999
What happened
in France is not over.

464
00:30:38.999 --> 00:30:41.999
<i>Okay, if, if you, if, if you</i>
<i>just give me this one solid...</i>

465
00:30:41.999 --> 00:30:42.999
I'll give you whatever you want.

466
00:30:43.999 --> 00:30:44.999
Please?

467
00:30:47.999 --> 00:30:48.999
-Okay, but you owe me.
-Yes.

468
00:30:50.999 --> 00:30:51.999
<i>I'll text you when it's ready.</i>

469
00:30:52.999 --> 00:30:53.999
<i>Okay.</i>

470
00:30:53.999 --> 00:30:55.999
What do you mean it's not over?

471
00:30:55.999 --> 00:30:57.999
I don't have time to explain.
Um, I love you, bye.

472
00:30:57.999 --> 00:30:59.999
<i>What? You love me?</i>

473
00:31:00.999 --> 00:31:02.999
Did I just say that?

474
00:31:03.999 --> 00:31:04.999
No, the entire park.

475
00:31:04.999 --> 00:31:06.000
We need to close off
to the public.

476
00:31:06.999 --> 00:31:07.999
Anyone still inside,
we need evacuated.

477
00:31:08.999 --> 00:31:10.999
<i>-Why, everyone...</i>
-Because it's not safe.

478
00:31:10.999 --> 00:31:12.999
Not just the main entrance,
all the entrances.

479
00:31:12.999 --> 00:31:14.000
So one moment I think
you're teaching in France...

480
00:31:14.999 --> 00:31:16.999
...and then next, I find out
that you're kidnapped.

481
00:31:16.999 --> 00:31:17.999
In Yemen.

482
00:31:18.999 --> 00:31:20.999
-By militants.
-I was in France...

483
00:31:20.999 --> 00:31:21.999
...and I found out about
these leak government files.

484
00:31:21.999 --> 00:31:22.999
And I had to go see
if it was real.

485
00:31:22.999 --> 00:31:24.999
This is a global threat.

486
00:31:24.999 --> 00:31:25.999
Hey, that's not your job, okay?

487
00:31:25.999 --> 00:31:27.999
Who, who do you think you...
You think you're James Bond?

488
00:31:28.999 --> 00:31:30.999
Do you have another explanation
for what's going on right now?

489
00:31:30.999 --> 00:31:31.999
Hey, you know what,
maybe I don't, maybe I don't.

490
00:31:31.999 --> 00:31:33.999
Maybe I'm just sitting
at a university...

491
00:31:33.999 --> 00:31:34.999
...trying to raise our daughter,

492
00:31:34.999 --> 00:31:36.999
...while you're running
around risking your life,

493
00:31:36.999 --> 00:31:37.999
...for God knows what.

494
00:31:37.999 --> 00:31:40.999
Don't. Don't do that right now.

495
00:31:42.999 --> 00:31:45.999
Now, the Hellstorm weapon is,
is real.

496
00:31:45.999 --> 00:31:46.999
-Hellstorm?
-I thought we were ...

497
00:31:46.999 --> 00:31:47.999
...leaving the park.

498
00:31:48.999 --> 00:31:49.999
Hellstorm weapon is a myth, Kate.

499
00:31:49.999 --> 00:31:51.999
Well, now you just sound like
the Department of Defense.

500
00:31:52.999 --> 00:31:53.999
Department of Defense? When were
you at Department of Defense?

501
00:31:53.999 --> 00:31:54.999
They pulled me out of Yemen.

502
00:31:54.999 --> 00:31:55.999
Hey but now you know
the whole story...

503
00:31:55.999 --> 00:31:57.999
...so we don't have to
go to couple's therapy.

504
00:31:57.999 --> 00:32:00.999
Oh, that's... You're gonna
make a joke out of this? Huh?

505
00:32:00.999 --> 00:32:02.999
A fully operational
resonance weapon...

506
00:32:02.999 --> 00:32:03.999
...is burrowing its way
into the earth's crust...

507
00:32:03.999 --> 00:32:05.999
...and destabilizing
the lithosphere.

508
00:32:05.999 --> 00:32:06.999
Those readings that
you sent to me from here...

509
00:32:06.999 --> 00:32:07.999
...they're happening
everywhere...

510
00:32:07.999 --> 00:32:09.999
...but especially on fault lines
like San Andreas that...

511
00:32:09.999 --> 00:32:11.999
...we are literally standing
on right now.

512
00:32:11.999 --> 00:32:12.999
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

513
00:32:12.999 --> 00:32:14.000
Yes, I know what you're saying.

514
00:32:14.999 --> 00:32:14.999
I don't.

515
00:32:15.999 --> 00:32:17.999
What's a resonance weapon?

516
00:32:19.999 --> 00:32:20.999
You just heard all that?

517
00:32:20.999 --> 00:32:21.999
Yeah.

518
00:32:21.999 --> 00:32:22.999
And including the part
where my mother...

519
00:32:22.999 --> 00:32:24.999
...has been seriously
kidnapped in Yemen,

520
00:32:24.999 --> 00:32:26.999
...and we have no idea
where you are.

521
00:32:32.999 --> 00:32:33.999
Kate, you were kidnapped?

522
00:32:54.999 --> 00:32:55.999
So, what's this all about...

523
00:32:55.999 --> 00:32:57.999
...'cause you're kinda
freaking me out.

524
00:32:57.999 --> 00:32:59.999
You're kidding me?
We can't talk about this here.

525
00:32:59.999 --> 00:33:00.999
The cameras have cameras.

526
00:33:01.999 --> 00:33:03.999
I feel like Gene Hackman
in "Enemy Of The State."

527
00:33:04.999 --> 00:33:06.999
Does any of this have
to do with the dump?

528
00:33:06.999 --> 00:33:07.999
Are we gonna get caught?

529
00:33:07.999 --> 00:33:09.999
This is bad, Penny.

530
00:33:09.999 --> 00:33:11.999
Like people are going to die.

531
00:33:11.999 --> 00:33:12.999
Like, they may already have.

532
00:33:12.999 --> 00:33:13.999
France?

533
00:33:13.999 --> 00:33:15.999
France, India.

534
00:33:16.999 --> 00:33:18.999
Now, it makes sense
that you said you loved me.

535
00:33:19.999 --> 00:33:20.999
What? No,
that was more of like a...

536
00:33:20.999 --> 00:33:23.999
...moment of severe stress and
anxiety more than anything.

537
00:33:23.999 --> 00:33:24.999
I didn't really, you know,
mean anything by it.

538
00:33:24.999 --> 00:33:27.999
-Oh, too bad.
-Too bad?

539
00:33:27.999 --> 00:33:28.999
What do you mean too bad?
Too bad.

540
00:33:28.999 --> 00:33:29.999
Nothing.

541
00:33:31.999 --> 00:33:33.999
But hey, you brought
me soup to work.

542
00:33:33.999 --> 00:33:35.999
We're like an old married couple,
right?

543
00:33:38.999 --> 00:33:39.999
Oh, God.

544
00:33:53.999 --> 00:33:54.999
Right.

545
00:34:01.999 --> 00:34:03.999
That's the same stuff
every time, come on.

546
00:34:03.999 --> 00:34:04.999
What's this?

547
00:34:05.999 --> 00:34:08.000
Yeah. It's, uh... It's soup.

548
00:34:09.999 --> 00:34:11.999
What? We can't bring
in soup anymore?

549
00:34:11.999 --> 00:34:13.999
Come on,
my girlfriend brought it for me.

550
00:34:13.999 --> 00:34:14.999
Been workin' through lunch.

551
00:34:14.999 --> 00:34:16.999
Burning the candle at both ends.

552
00:34:16.999 --> 00:34:17.999
You know how it goes.

553
00:34:17.999 --> 00:34:18.999
I think it's made of basil.

554
00:34:19.999 --> 00:34:20.999
You smell the basil?

555
00:34:20.999 --> 00:34:23.999
Think it's, like,
in there somewhere.

556
00:34:23.999 --> 00:34:25.999
Okay, I'll tell you what, if
I don't finish the whole thing...

557
00:34:25.999 --> 00:34:27.999
I'll come back and
I'll give you the rest of it.

558
00:34:27.999 --> 00:34:29.999
Yeah? I'm good?

559
00:34:30.999 --> 00:34:31.999
Great. Thanks, Hughes.

560
00:34:47.999 --> 00:34:49.999
Loading, unloading.
I swear I'm having Deja vu.

561
00:34:50.999 --> 00:34:51.999
Who cares?

562
00:34:54.999 --> 00:34:56.999
Must've been tough to listen to.

563
00:34:57.999 --> 00:34:58.999
Between your parents and all?

564
00:34:59.999 --> 00:35:01.999
It's not exactly
"The Brady Bunch."

565
00:35:02.999 --> 00:35:03.999
Did you not know
where your mom was?

566
00:35:04.999 --> 00:35:05.999
Apparently not.

567
00:35:06.999 --> 00:35:07.999
You know, she's always
off doing something...

568
00:35:07.999 --> 00:35:09.999
...and trying to save
the world from something...

569
00:35:09.999 --> 00:35:12.999
...but this one, you know,
really takes the kick.

570
00:35:12.999 --> 00:35:13.999
Wow.

571
00:35:14.999 --> 00:35:15.999
My mom never leaves me alone.

572
00:35:15.999 --> 00:35:17.999
-So...
-Oh. Heh heh.

573
00:35:17.999 --> 00:35:18.999
I wish I knew what that was like.

574
00:35:18.999 --> 00:35:19.999
Trust me,

575
00:35:19.999 --> 00:35:20.999
you really don't.

576
00:35:22.999 --> 00:35:23.999
I guess the grass
is always greener.

577
00:35:23.999 --> 00:35:24.999
Yeah, I guess.

578
00:35:29.999 --> 00:35:30.999
What the hell is that?

579
00:35:32.999 --> 00:35:34.999
That's not good.

580
00:35:34.999 --> 00:35:36.999
Look, it's one thing
for some kook...

581
00:35:36.999 --> 00:35:39.999
...to wax on about the apocalypse
it's a whole other scenario...

582
00:35:39.999 --> 00:35:41.999
...when the things she warned us
about actually start to happen.

583
00:35:41.999 --> 00:35:43.999
The weapon was destroyed.

584
00:35:43.999 --> 00:35:44.999
How certain are you?

585
00:35:44.999 --> 00:35:45.999
France is on a fault line, sir.

586
00:35:45.999 --> 00:35:47.999
They've suffered
major earthquakes before.

587
00:35:47.999 --> 00:35:49.999
This is all just bad coincidence.

588
00:35:49.999 --> 00:35:51.999
From our intel, it's a bit
more than just an earthquake.

589
00:35:51.999 --> 00:35:53.999
And I don't subscribe
to bad coincidences.

590
00:35:53.999 --> 00:35:55.000
When our offices were hacked,

591
00:35:55.999 --> 00:35:57.999
you know what got leaked.
I don't have to tell you this.

592
00:35:57.999 --> 00:36:01.999
So, did we or did we not
ever get Hellstorm operation?

593
00:36:01.999 --> 00:36:02.999
No, there's never been
a successful test.

594
00:36:02.999 --> 00:36:04.999
Even Nikola Tesla couldn't
figure that one out.

595
00:36:04.999 --> 00:36:05.999
And he discovered it.

596
00:36:07.999 --> 00:36:09.999
You know what they say
about a hundred monkeys?

597
00:36:10.999 --> 00:36:11.999
No, what?

598
00:36:12.999 --> 00:36:13.999
Lock them in a room
with some typewriters...

599
00:36:13.999 --> 00:36:15.999
...and eventually, you'll get
a few lines of Shakespeare.

600
00:36:16.999 --> 00:36:18.999
It's time we started
running some scenarios...

601
00:36:18.999 --> 00:36:20.999
...and the off chance that this
wasn't just a coincidence.

602
00:36:22.999 --> 00:36:24.999
Sir, we have reports of
another disturbance.

603
00:36:30.999 --> 00:36:31.999
Alright, Kate,
we are leaving now.

604
00:36:31.999 --> 00:36:32.999
Did you find a pattern?

605
00:36:32.999 --> 00:36:34.000
Between setting up
shop and being...

606
00:36:34.999 --> 00:36:35.999
...chased by a pyroclastic
debris cloud?

607
00:36:35.999 --> 00:36:37.999
No, we haven't had chance
to sit down and access it, yet.

608
00:36:37.999 --> 00:36:39.999
-Just a question.
-It's not just a question.

609
00:36:39.999 --> 00:36:40.999
I know how
that head of yours works.

610
00:36:40.999 --> 00:36:42.999
This information.
This is what I need.

611
00:36:42.999 --> 00:36:44.999
Distance, time, location.
Do you have a printout of this?

612
00:36:44.999 --> 00:36:45.999
Kate, come on.

613
00:36:45.999 --> 00:36:46.999
Oh.

614
00:36:46.999 --> 00:36:47.999
Come on, we gotta go.

615
00:36:47.999 --> 00:36:48.999
I need that printout.

616
00:36:51.999 --> 00:36:54.999
-What are you looking for?
-She's looking for a pattern.

617
00:36:54.999 --> 00:36:55.999
Pattern?

618
00:36:56.999 --> 00:36:57.999
The only way to reverse
what's already happened...

619
00:36:57.999 --> 00:36:58.999
...is to predict
the waves in formation.

620
00:36:58.999 --> 00:37:00.999
The what? Ma'am,
this is way above my pay grade.

621
00:37:00.999 --> 00:37:02.999
Hey, Kate, we're out of time.
We have to go.

622
00:37:02.999 --> 00:37:03.999
I got to get one more reading.

623
00:37:06.999 --> 00:37:07.999
<i>Ah.</i>

624
00:37:08.999 --> 00:37:09.999
Ahh!

625
00:37:12.999 --> 00:37:13.999
Go!

626
00:37:18.999 --> 00:37:20.999
That's really, really not good.

627
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:22.999
-Jessie!
-Ah!

628
00:37:23.999 --> 00:37:24.999
Jessie!

629
00:37:25.999 --> 00:37:26.999
Get to the truck.

630
00:37:26.999 --> 00:37:28.999
-What is that?
-Just get to the truck.

631
00:37:34.999 --> 00:37:37.999
<i>Martin! Come on.</i>
<i>We gotta go. Just leave it!</i>

632
00:37:39.999 --> 00:37:40.999
<i>Martin, get out!</i>

633
00:37:41.999 --> 00:37:42.999
<i>Martin, come on!</i>

634
00:37:45.999 --> 00:37:46.999
I got it!

635
00:37:49.999 --> 00:37:50.999
No!

636
00:37:52.999 --> 00:37:53.999
Martin! Martin!

637
00:37:55.999 --> 00:37:59.999
No! No!

638
00:37:59.999 --> 00:38:00.999
-He's gone.
-No, no, no!

639
00:38:00.999 --> 00:38:01.999
-He's gone.
-No!

640
00:38:01.999 --> 00:38:02.999
-No! No!
-He's gone!

641
00:38:38.999 --> 00:38:39.999
Watch out!

642
00:39:05.999 --> 00:39:07.999
The storm's gone.

643
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.999
Kate, we gotta go back.
We can't leave him there.

644
00:39:11.999 --> 00:39:12.999
Rob, he's gone.

645
00:39:12.999 --> 00:39:13.999
Kate, we got to get his body.

646
00:39:13.999 --> 00:39:15.999
The only reason that
storm didn't kill us all,

647
00:39:15.999 --> 00:39:16.999
...didn't take
this entire park out is...

648
00:39:16.999 --> 00:39:18.999
...because of where we are.

649
00:39:18.999 --> 00:39:20.999
The San Andreas is a major vein
on the Yellowstone Caldera.

650
00:39:20.999 --> 00:39:23.999
And we are sitting
on a ticking time bomb.

651
00:39:23.999 --> 00:39:25.999
Which is why we need to go.

652
00:39:26.999 --> 00:39:28.000
-Go?
-Yes, it's too dangerous.

653
00:39:28.999 --> 00:39:29.999
I need you to take the kids
and get out of here.

654
00:39:30.999 --> 00:39:32.999
Of course, you know, we've only
been together for a few hours.

655
00:39:32.999 --> 00:39:33.999
That's good enough, right?

656
00:39:33.999 --> 00:39:34.999
It's not fair. Jesse,
every minute...

657
00:39:34.999 --> 00:39:36.999
...you are here is a minute
you are more in danger.

658
00:39:37.999 --> 00:39:40.000
Exactly my point.
And you feel the need to stay?

659
00:39:40.999 --> 00:39:41.999
Just like you
decided to risk your life...

660
00:39:41.999 --> 00:39:42.999
...in some godforsaken
desert somewhere?

661
00:39:42.999 --> 00:39:45.999
So not the time to be
having this discussion.

662
00:39:45.999 --> 00:39:47.999
Of course, it's not.
You never want to talk about it.

663
00:39:51.999 --> 00:39:53.999
Okay, you know this park,
what's the closest exit?

664
00:39:54.999 --> 00:39:56.999
No. Listen, Kate.
If you're right,

665
00:39:57.999 --> 00:39:58.999
where are we gonna go
that we're safe, huh?

666
00:39:58.999 --> 00:40:01.999
Los Angeles? San Francisco?

667
00:40:01.999 --> 00:40:03.999
There's nowhere that we
can go that we're not in danger.

668
00:40:03.999 --> 00:40:05.999
Now we are not leaving you.

669
00:40:06.999 --> 00:40:07.999
You understand?

670
00:40:08.999 --> 00:40:10.999
But if you have a plan,
I sure would like to hear it.

671
00:40:11.999 --> 00:40:13.999
If I'd just got the rest of
those readings off that computer,

672
00:40:13.999 --> 00:40:14.999
-I could have enough information.
-She's pacing.

673
00:40:14.999 --> 00:40:15.999
She's pacing.
What does that mean?

674
00:40:15.999 --> 00:40:17.999
-It means she's thinking.
-Or just triangulate.

675
00:40:18.999 --> 00:40:19.999
Yeah, if we can
triangulate the waves,

676
00:40:19.999 --> 00:40:20.999
you can get
three different readings...

677
00:40:20.999 --> 00:40:23.999
...from three different locations
that might be enough information.

678
00:40:23.999 --> 00:40:24.999
Enough for what?

679
00:40:24.999 --> 00:40:26.999
To try and isolate the wave.

680
00:40:26.999 --> 00:40:27.999
You think you
can stop this thing?

681
00:40:27.999 --> 00:40:29.999
Whoa, wait.

682
00:40:30.999 --> 00:40:31.999
What?

683
00:40:31.999 --> 00:40:32.999
We're gonna stop this thing?

684
00:40:32.999 --> 00:40:35.999
Us? Right here? This thing
that's tearing up the globe?

685
00:40:35.999 --> 00:40:37.999
Yeah, but we're gonna
need a little help.

686
00:40:37.999 --> 00:40:40.999
Y... You're talking about an
explosion in the magnitude of,

687
00:40:40.999 --> 00:40:42.999
oh, oh, one-kilo ton
nuclear bomb!

688
00:40:42.999 --> 00:40:43.999
Where are we gonna get that?

689
00:40:44.999 --> 00:40:45.999
That's plan B.

690
00:40:45.999 --> 00:40:47.999
She has a plan B. Like this one.

691
00:40:47.999 --> 00:40:48.999
Okay, look, we're here.

692
00:40:48.999 --> 00:40:50.999
This is where we need
to go to get the first reading.

693
00:41:11.999 --> 00:41:13.999
<i>The Hellstorm weapon</i>
<i>is operational.</i>

694
00:41:14.999 --> 00:41:15.999
You mean the weapon
that doesn't exist?

695
00:41:17.999 --> 00:41:18.999
Sorry, just trying to clarify.

696
00:41:18.999 --> 00:41:20.999
Been trying to get my head
around this whole thing.

697
00:41:20.999 --> 00:41:21.999
I'll shut up.

698
00:41:22.999 --> 00:41:24.999
Hellstorm is a device
that uses resonance...

699
00:41:24.999 --> 00:41:26.999
...to amplify toroidal currents
deep within the earth's crust...

700
00:41:26.999 --> 00:41:27.999
...causing disasters.

701
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.999
Now you've all seen
an opera singer...

702
00:41:29.999 --> 00:41:31.999
...break a crystal glass
with her voice.

703
00:41:31.999 --> 00:41:33.999
It's the same thing,
but on a global scale.

704
00:41:33.999 --> 00:41:35.999
<i>Hellstorm is the voice,</i>

705
00:41:35.999 --> 00:41:37.999
<i>the earth's crust is</i>
<i>the crystal glass.</i>

706
00:41:39.999 --> 00:41:41.999
<i>Now the fracture is so deep</i>
<i>within the earth's crust...</i>

707
00:41:41.999 --> 00:41:42.999
...that it releases a rush
of high-pressure gases...

708
00:41:42.999 --> 00:41:44.999
...causing these storms.

709
00:41:44.999 --> 00:41:46.999
It's a one-two punch
of natural disasters.

710
00:41:47.999 --> 00:41:50.999
As a result, the earthquakes
release the powerful storms.

711
00:41:51.999 --> 00:41:52.999
It'll wipe out any city it hits.

712
00:41:53.999 --> 00:41:54.999
If it's a wave
as you say it is then...

713
00:41:54.999 --> 00:41:57.999
...it should just fade over time.
Get weaker.

714
00:41:57.999 --> 00:41:58.999
No, wh...
When the device is active...

715
00:41:58.999 --> 00:42:00.999
...it's designed to get
stronger over time.

716
00:42:01.999 --> 00:42:03.999
<i>That's what a resonance weapon</i>
<i>is designed to do.</i>

717
00:42:04.999 --> 00:42:06.999
So, we take it out.
Bomb the area again.

718
00:42:06.999 --> 00:42:08.999
It's not that simple.
It's too deep.

719
00:42:08.999 --> 00:42:09.999
Our most powerful weapon...

720
00:42:09.999 --> 00:42:12.999
...has a range of 200 feet
below the surface.

721
00:42:12.999 --> 00:42:13.999
Hellstorm by now is
over a thousand feet deep.

722
00:42:13.999 --> 00:42:16.999
Besides a bomb of
that magnitude on foreign soil...

723
00:42:16.999 --> 00:42:18.999
...would only
exacerbate global tensions.

724
00:42:18.999 --> 00:42:19.999
Global tensions?

725
00:42:20.999 --> 00:42:21.999
Sir, have you seen the news?

726
00:42:26.999 --> 00:42:27.999
Got it, I'm shutting up.

727
00:42:30.999 --> 00:42:32.999
Now there is good news, however.

728
00:42:32.999 --> 00:42:34.999
In our preliminary test with
the weapon, there's a signature.

729
00:42:35.999 --> 00:42:36.999
It's a signal
that's associated...

730
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.999
...with the ultra-low frequency
waves that it sends out.

731
00:42:39.999 --> 00:42:41.999
Uh, drones, radial rays,

732
00:42:41.999 --> 00:42:43.999
whatever you can tap
into we have to find that signal.

733
00:42:43.999 --> 00:42:46.999
It's the first and most
important step in stopping this.

734
00:42:47.999 --> 00:42:48.999
What if we don't stop it?

735
00:42:50.999 --> 00:42:52.999
Then, it's an end-game scenario.

736
00:42:56.999 --> 00:42:58.999
<i>There are several hotspots</i>
<i>around the globe.</i>

737
00:42:58.999 --> 00:43:01.999
<i>Pacific rim, Indonesian,</i>
<i>Yellowstone.</i>

738
00:43:01.999 --> 00:43:03.999
A Hellstorm eruption
in one of those areas...

739
00:43:03.999 --> 00:43:04.999
...would not just threaten
a city,

740
00:43:05.999 --> 00:43:06.999
it would threaten the human race.

741
00:43:38.999 --> 00:43:39.999
Bite me.

742
00:43:45.999 --> 00:43:47.999
Godspeed, you wonderful monster.

743
00:43:55.999 --> 00:43:56.999
Did the server crash?

744
00:43:57.999 --> 00:43:58.999
It seems li.. It seems like it.

745
00:43:58.999 --> 00:44:00.999
I'm... I'm locked out.
Is everyone else locked out?

746
00:44:09.999 --> 00:44:10.999
Yes, sir.

747
00:44:10.999 --> 00:44:12.999
Uh, no, we have a team working
on that as we speak, sir.

748
00:44:14.999 --> 00:44:16.999
Of course, call it a...

749
00:44:16.999 --> 00:44:17.999
A contingency plan.

750
00:44:19.999 --> 00:44:22.999
Yeah, yes, sir.
Yes, sir. Will do.

751
00:44:29.999 --> 00:44:30.999
Yes?

752
00:44:30.999 --> 00:44:32.999
Our entire network
was just shut down.

753
00:44:32.999 --> 00:44:33.999
We've been hacked.

754
00:44:33.999 --> 00:44:34.999
Oh, damn it.

755
00:44:35.999 --> 00:44:36.999
Well, how extensive is it?

756
00:44:36.999 --> 00:44:37.999
Everything, sir.

757
00:44:41.999 --> 00:44:42.999
Have we found that signal yet?

758
00:45:05.999 --> 00:45:09.999
<i>The Hellstorm weapon creates</i>
<i>a catastrophic wave of energy.</i>

759
00:45:09.999 --> 00:45:11.999
And we're gonna need an equal...

760
00:45:11.999 --> 00:45:13.999
...and opposite wave
of energy to destroy it.

761
00:45:14.999 --> 00:45:15.999
So that's what we're looking for.

762
00:45:17.999 --> 00:45:18.999
Okay, I think it's working.

763
00:45:19.999 --> 00:45:20.999
Good job, Jake.

764
00:45:25.999 --> 00:45:25.999
So what are we
supposed to do now?

765
00:45:25.999 --> 00:45:27.999
Just kinda wait for
somethin' bad to happen?

766
00:45:27.999 --> 00:45:30.999
Yeah, hope that
the next one isn't as bad.

767
00:45:31.999 --> 00:45:32.999
That's not very comforting.

768
00:45:37.999 --> 00:45:39.999
-You should go talk to her.
-I don't how to talk to her.

769
00:45:41.999 --> 00:45:44.999
Kate, she's not
a mathematical equation...

770
00:45:44.999 --> 00:45:45.999
...that you can get wrong.

771
00:45:46.999 --> 00:45:47.999
You're her mother.

772
00:45:48.999 --> 00:45:49.999
Just talk to her.

773
00:45:53.999 --> 00:45:54.999
Okay, we're getting something.

774
00:46:00.999 --> 00:46:01.999
-This is it.
-Get on the timer.

775
00:46:01.999 --> 00:46:03.999
-Record the readings.
-I'm trying.

776
00:46:23.999 --> 00:46:24.999
You okay?

777
00:46:24.999 --> 00:46:26.999
I think it stopped.

778
00:46:26.999 --> 00:46:29.999
Storm's coming. Are we dead?

779
00:46:29.999 --> 00:46:30.999
Jake...

780
00:46:31.999 --> 00:46:32.999
Jake, we're fine.

781
00:46:32.999 --> 00:46:35.999
Oh, of course.
Yeah, no, I knew that.

782
00:46:36.999 --> 00:46:37.999
Did you get the reading?

783
00:46:37.999 --> 00:46:38.999
Yeah.

784
00:46:41.999 --> 00:46:43.999
Now I know why Rob
likes having you around.

785
00:46:43.999 --> 00:46:44.999
Thanks.

786
00:46:45.999 --> 00:46:47.999
We have one reading,
we need two more.

787
00:46:47.999 --> 00:46:48.999
Guys, the quicker
we get these readings...

788
00:46:48.999 --> 00:46:50.999
...the quicker
we can get out of here.

789
00:46:51.999 --> 00:46:52.999
What do you have in mind?

790
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.999
Say, we got the equipment,

791
00:46:54.999 --> 00:46:55.999
we got walkies in the truck...

792
00:46:56.999 --> 00:46:57.999
We need to split up.

793
00:46:59.999 --> 00:47:01.999
I think it's a bad idea.

794
00:47:01.999 --> 00:47:03.999
We're standing
on the San Andreas fault.

795
00:47:03.999 --> 00:47:04.999
I need readings from both plates.

796
00:47:04.999 --> 00:47:06.999
The Pacific and
the North American.

797
00:47:06.999 --> 00:47:08.999
That bad idea is our only chance.

798
00:47:10.999 --> 00:47:11.999
I'll go with Dad.

799
00:47:12.999 --> 00:47:13.999
No, wait.

800
00:47:14.999 --> 00:47:15.999
You go with your mother.

801
00:47:16.999 --> 00:47:17.999
Jake, you're with me.

802
00:47:17.999 --> 00:47:19.999
We're gonna take the truck,
go up that bridge up there.

803
00:47:19.999 --> 00:47:21.999
We'll get our reading. You guys
get your reading right here.

804
00:47:21.999 --> 00:47:24.999
When we're done, we'll
meet back at the bridge, okay?

805
00:47:26.999 --> 00:47:28.999
You guys be careful,
the last shake that we had...

806
00:47:28.999 --> 00:47:30.999
...is hitting somewhere else,
and we're not gonna be as lucky.

807
00:47:32.999 --> 00:47:33.999
Hey...

808
00:47:35.999 --> 00:47:36.999
Be careful.

809
00:47:47.999 --> 00:47:48.999
Thank you.

810
00:47:56.999 --> 00:47:58.999
Okay, folks, I got a problem,
needs fixing.

811
00:47:58.999 --> 00:48:00.999
Who's my best deck?

812
00:48:00.999 --> 00:48:01.999
-That's me. Right here.
-I am.

813
00:48:04.999 --> 00:48:07.999
Right. Drew. Come with me.

814
00:48:08.999 --> 00:48:09.999
Come on, let's go.

815
00:48:09.999 --> 00:48:11.999
I'm comin'.

816
00:48:13.999 --> 00:48:15.999
Oh! Earthquake.

817
00:48:42.999 --> 00:48:44.999
Okay, it's over.

818
00:48:44.999 --> 00:48:46.999
Back to work, people.

819
00:48:47.999 --> 00:48:49.999
Let's go. Come on.

820
00:48:49.999 --> 00:48:51.999
This whole building is gonna
come down on top of us...

821
00:48:51.999 --> 00:48:53.999
...we'll be trapped inside,
that's, like, my worst nightmare.

822
00:48:53.999 --> 00:48:54.999
Well, from what I've been
hearin' around the world...

823
00:48:54.999 --> 00:48:55.999
...you'd be a lucky one.

824
00:48:57.999 --> 00:48:59.999
Alright. Get in there, plug in.

825
00:48:59.999 --> 00:49:01.999
You get 30 minutes, okay?
Clock tickin'.

826
00:49:11.999 --> 00:49:12.999
Okay.

827
00:49:29.999 --> 00:49:31.999
<i>We're approaching the bridge</i>
<i>with our equipment.</i>

828
00:49:31.999 --> 00:49:33.999
<i>Everything you need should</i>
<i>be in those bags.</i>

829
00:49:33.999 --> 00:49:35.999
Copy that, Rob.
We're on our way to set it up.

830
00:49:36.999 --> 00:49:38.999
This is kind of ironic, huh?

831
00:49:38.999 --> 00:49:39.999
What's that?

832
00:49:39.999 --> 00:49:43.999
I remember when you and I, we'd
go hike the canyons together.

833
00:49:43.999 --> 00:49:46.999
That was ages ago.
What was I, like, five?

834
00:49:46.999 --> 00:49:48.999
Okay, you know what?
I get that you're upset with me.

835
00:49:48.999 --> 00:49:50.999
Yeah, what gave it away?

836
00:49:51.999 --> 00:49:52.999
Set up here.

837
00:49:53.999 --> 00:49:54.999
Yeah. Work.

838
00:49:54.999 --> 00:49:57.999
So much easier than
having a real discussion.

839
00:50:19.999 --> 00:50:20.999
You're sure this is it?

840
00:50:22.999 --> 00:50:25.999
Yeah, yeah. This is it.

841
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:26.999
We'll set up right here.

842
00:50:27.999 --> 00:50:28.999
Okay.

843
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.000
Kate...

844
00:50:30.999 --> 00:50:31.999
Kate, we're positioned.

845
00:50:32.999 --> 00:50:34.999
<i>Right. Lemme know</i>
<i>when you're up and running.</i>

846
00:50:34.999 --> 00:50:35.999
Copy.

847
00:50:42.999 --> 00:50:43.999
Here.

848
00:50:48.999 --> 00:50:49.999
Here, plug it in.

849
00:50:58.999 --> 00:51:00.999
Come on.
What's wrong with this thing?

850
00:51:00.999 --> 00:51:01.999
Oh, you press this.

851
00:51:03.999 --> 00:51:05.999
Look at that.
Your dad taught you well.

852
00:51:07.999 --> 00:51:11.999
-Yeah. I'm up.
-Me, too.

853
00:51:11.999 --> 00:51:12.999
I'm already getting readings.

854
00:51:13.999 --> 00:51:15.999
-Oh, wow.
-This is crazy.

855
00:51:15.999 --> 00:51:17.999
Look at that frequency.

856
00:51:17.999 --> 00:51:18.999
And it's definitely building.

857
00:51:40.999 --> 00:51:42.999
-Is there a problem?
-Uh, no.

858
00:51:43.999 --> 00:51:45.999
I was just gonna go
use the restroom. Uh, I've...

859
00:51:46.999 --> 00:51:47.999
I don't ask for permission,
it's sort of...

860
00:51:47.999 --> 00:51:48.999
I got an emergency, you know?

861
00:51:48.999 --> 00:51:51.999
Code red, uh,
code brown, actually.

862
00:51:52.999 --> 00:51:54.999
Ah, just go. Make it quick.

863
00:51:54.999 --> 00:51:56.999
-Okay.
-Hold it. You...

864
00:51:56.999 --> 00:51:57.999
You're not takin' your laptop?

865
00:51:58.999 --> 00:52:00.999
Well... Yeah.

866
00:52:01.999 --> 00:52:04.999
I mean, I might be
in there for a while...

867
00:52:04.999 --> 00:52:05.999
...so I figured
I'd just, you know,

868
00:52:05.999 --> 00:52:06.999
get some work done, maybe...

869
00:52:06.999 --> 00:52:07.999
No, I need you to give it to me.

870
00:52:08.999 --> 00:52:10.999
Come on. Why don't
you hand it over now?

871
00:52:10.999 --> 00:52:11.999
No, no, no, no, no, no.

872
00:52:11.999 --> 00:52:12.999
Security!

873
00:52:12.999 --> 00:52:13.999
Sir! Sir, stop!

874
00:52:13.999 --> 00:52:15.999
I need the building to
be on lockdown right now.

875
00:52:22.999 --> 00:52:23.999
Stop him! Stop him!

876
00:52:25.999 --> 00:52:27.999
What am I doing? What am I doing?

877
00:52:58.999 --> 00:53:00.000
I'm goin' to jail. But not today.

878
00:53:15.999 --> 00:53:16.999
No shit for you.

879
00:53:19.999 --> 00:53:20.999
-Give up...
-Ugh...

880
00:53:29.999 --> 00:53:31.999
Another breach?
Who's messing with us?

881
00:53:32.999 --> 00:53:34.000
I don't have to tell you the
ramifications of all this shit.

882
00:53:34.999 --> 00:53:35.999
Any of it to find its
way back to our doorstep.

883
00:53:35.999 --> 00:53:37.999
It's not my first day, sir.

884
00:53:37.999 --> 00:53:39.999
I'm aware. Just make
sure it's not your last.

885
00:53:40.999 --> 00:53:42.999
I'm on a plane to
brief the joint chiefs.

886
00:53:42.999 --> 00:53:44.999
When I land...
Uh, let me correct that.

887
00:53:44.999 --> 00:53:45.999
If I land, I wanna know that...

888
00:53:45.999 --> 00:53:48.999
...the situation's been
scrubbed and sanitized.

889
00:53:49.999 --> 00:53:50.999
Are we clear?

890
00:53:51.999 --> 00:53:52.999
Yes, sir.

891
00:53:53.999 --> 00:53:56.999
You have my permission
to proceed with impunity.

892
00:54:16.999 --> 00:54:18.000
Lot of seismic activity
over here.

893
00:54:18.999 --> 00:54:20.999
Ooh! Look at that.

894
00:54:20.999 --> 00:54:21.999
Wow.

895
00:54:21.999 --> 00:54:22.999
We got one comin' soon.

896
00:54:22.999 --> 00:54:24.999
Yeah, something's
definitely coming.

897
00:54:26.999 --> 00:54:29.999
Hey, Mom? I think
we're picking up something.

898
00:54:46.999 --> 00:54:49.999
-Mom?
-Rob! Rob, come in.

899
00:54:52.999 --> 00:54:54.999
-You good?
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, fine.

900
00:54:54.999 --> 00:54:57.999
Come on. Kate... Kate, come in.

901
00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.999
-Mom, we need to go now.
-Rob... Rob, come in.

902
00:55:00.999 --> 00:55:02.999
-No, Rob. Rob!
-Mom. Mom.

903
00:55:02.999 --> 00:55:04.999
-Kate, come in. Damn it!
-Professor.

904
00:55:04.999 --> 00:55:06.999
Professor, is this normal?

905
00:55:07.999 --> 00:55:12.999
No, that is not normal.
Brace yourself.

906
00:55:21.999 --> 00:55:22.999
Mom?

907
00:55:23.999 --> 00:55:24.999
We need to leave now.

908
00:55:36.999 --> 00:55:38.999
-That's not good.
-No.

909
00:55:39.999 --> 00:55:40.999
No, it's not.

910
00:55:43.999 --> 00:55:45.999
-Please, come on.
-Mom! We have to go!

911
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.999
I have to get this data.

912
00:55:47.999 --> 00:55:49.999
Mom! Mom!

913
00:55:49.999 --> 00:55:50.999
-Jessie!
-Mom!

914
00:55:50.999 --> 00:55:53.999
-Jessie!
-Mom, please!

915
00:55:53.999 --> 00:55:56.999
Mom! Come on!

916
00:55:56.999 --> 00:55:58.999
Jessie, run. Jessie, go!

917
00:56:00.999 --> 00:56:02.999
Mom, we have to go!

918
00:56:02.999 --> 00:56:05.999
-I got it, I got it. Go, go!
-Just run!

919
00:56:15.999 --> 00:56:16.999
Let's go. Come on!

920
00:56:19.999 --> 00:56:20.999
Get down!

921
00:56:22.999 --> 00:56:24.999
We gotta go! In the truck!

922
00:56:46.999 --> 00:56:49.999
Do you have any idea the depth
of the trouble you're in?

923
00:56:50.999 --> 00:56:51.999
Me?

924
00:56:52.999 --> 00:56:53.999
Don't you mean "Us?"

925
00:56:57.999 --> 00:56:58.999
Okay, okay, okay, I get...

926
00:57:08.999 --> 00:57:10.999
I don't think you appreciate
the situation you're in.

927
00:57:11.999 --> 00:57:12.999
We looked at your computer.

928
00:57:12.999 --> 00:57:14.999
You hacked into
a government database.

929
00:57:14.999 --> 00:57:17.999
You stole classified documents.
Now, where did you send them?

930
00:57:19.999 --> 00:57:20.999
I sent them to my mother.

931
00:57:21.999 --> 00:57:24.999
I thought it was a recipe
for sugar cookies.

932
00:57:29.999 --> 00:57:32.999
Okay, okay, okay...

933
00:57:33.999 --> 00:57:34.999
I sent them to the professor.

934
00:57:35.999 --> 00:57:37.999
She knows more about this
than any of us.

935
00:57:37.999 --> 00:57:39.999
No, she doesn't.

936
00:57:39.999 --> 00:57:41.999
We have all the data.

937
00:57:41.999 --> 00:57:43.999
Not just hers, but
an entire network of information.

938
00:57:43.999 --> 00:57:44.999
Now, she's just one person.

939
00:57:44.999 --> 00:57:45.999
Have you ever
stopped to consider...

940
00:57:45.999 --> 00:57:47.999
what would happen if she's wrong?

941
00:57:49.999 --> 00:57:51.999
I will not allow her to
doom humanity in some...

942
00:57:51.999 --> 00:57:53.999
ill-conceived attempt to save it.

943
00:57:53.999 --> 00:57:55.999
No, 'cause you've got
that covered, don't you?

944
00:57:57.999 --> 00:57:59.999
Oh, come on,
you know you want to.

945
00:58:06.999 --> 00:58:07.999
You work out?

946
00:58:08.999 --> 00:58:10.999
You listen to me,
you little speck of nothing...

947
00:58:11.999 --> 00:58:12.999
once this is all over,

948
00:58:12.999 --> 00:58:14.999
and you and the professor are
deemed enemies of the state...

949
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000
I will make it my mission
to make sure you...

950
00:58:17.999 --> 00:58:19.999
end up in the darkest,
vilest hole imaginable...

951
00:58:19.999 --> 00:58:23.999
to spend the rest of
your long and agonizing life...

952
00:58:23.999 --> 00:58:25.999
unless you tell me where she is.

953
00:58:27.999 --> 00:58:29.999
Now, where is she?

954
00:58:38.999 --> 00:58:41.999
Rob, come in. Rob, come in.

955
00:58:42.999 --> 00:58:44.999
-Why aren't they answering?
-I don't know.

956
00:58:45.999 --> 00:58:46.999
You don't think
they could have been...

957
00:58:46.999 --> 00:58:47.999
caught
in that explosion, do you?

958
00:58:47.999 --> 00:58:50.999
They were right across from us
if they set up in the right area.

959
00:58:50.999 --> 00:58:51.999
They could've got
caught in that eruption.

960
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:52.999
They weren't.

961
00:58:53.999 --> 00:58:54.999
You don't know that.

962
00:58:54.999 --> 00:58:55.999
Rob, come in. We need that info.

963
00:58:57.999 --> 00:58:58.999
I thought you were
worried about dad.

964
00:58:58.999 --> 00:58:59.999
I am.

965
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.999
No. You're worried
about getting his info.

966
00:59:01.999 --> 00:59:03.999
You don't think I'm worried
about your father right now?

967
00:59:04.999 --> 00:59:06.000
Who knows what you worry about...

968
00:59:06.999 --> 00:59:07.999
when you're halfway
around the world?

969
00:59:11.999 --> 00:59:13.999
Well, we're not looking for them.

970
00:59:13.999 --> 00:59:14.999
So what are you doing?

971
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.999
Looking for an important e-mail.

972
00:59:25.999 --> 00:59:26.999
I'm gonna go look for dad.

973
00:59:26.999 --> 00:59:28.999
No, no. Uh,
you're not going anywhere.

974
00:59:28.999 --> 00:59:29.999
We're not splitting up.
Not in this.

975
00:59:36.999 --> 00:59:37.999
Holy crap! He did it!

976
00:59:37.999 --> 00:59:38.999
He got, uh, he got the files.

977
00:59:40.999 --> 00:59:42.999
All you care about
are these files!

978
00:59:44.999 --> 00:59:45.999
And in the meantime,

979
00:59:45.999 --> 00:59:47.999
dad could have gotten
killed in an explosion!

980
00:59:48.999 --> 00:59:49.999
Jessie, there are
things in this world...

981
00:59:49.999 --> 00:59:50.999
that are bigger than you and me.

982
00:59:50.999 --> 00:59:52.999
They are bigger than family.

983
00:59:52.999 --> 00:59:54.999
Nothing is bigger than family!

984
00:59:59.999 --> 01:00:01.999
Okay, you're right. You're right.

985
01:00:01.999 --> 01:00:04.999
Jess, just sometimes the world
isn't that black and white.

986
01:00:05.999 --> 01:00:06.999
-Why can't it be?
-Because it's not.

987
01:00:07.999 --> 01:00:10.999
For me it never has been.
I make sacrifices,

988
01:00:10.999 --> 01:00:12.999
and I live with them.
And I do dangerous things...

989
01:00:12.999 --> 01:00:14.999
that take me away
from you because I have to.

990
01:00:15.999 --> 01:00:17.000
Because it's my calling,
and I hope...

991
01:00:18.999 --> 01:00:20.000
someday that you understand that.

992
01:00:28.999 --> 01:00:30.999
But for now... baby...

993
01:00:34.999 --> 01:00:35.999
Let's just go find your dad.

994
01:00:37.999 --> 01:00:38.999
Let's go.

995
01:00:41.999 --> 01:00:41.999
Rob.

996
01:00:43.999 --> 01:00:44.999
Rob, come in. Do you hear me?

997
01:00:45.999 --> 01:00:47.000
We don't have all day, so...

998
01:00:47.999 --> 01:00:49.999
this is gonna keep going until
you give me a reason to stop.

999
01:00:50.999 --> 01:00:52.999
Now, where is she,
and what is she doing?

1000
01:00:52.999 --> 01:00:55.999
I don't know. I swear.

1001
01:00:57.999 --> 01:01:00.999
Sir, intel thinks they found
Hellstorm wave signature.

1002
01:01:03.999 --> 01:01:05.999
I may not need you, after all.

1003
01:01:25.999 --> 01:01:26.999
Kate! Jessie! Come in.

1004
01:01:29.999 --> 01:01:30.999
They're not here?

1005
01:01:36.999 --> 01:01:38.999
Kate. Kate. Jessie, come in.

1006
01:01:41.999 --> 01:01:42.999
Kate, come in.

1007
01:01:48.999 --> 01:01:51.999
Kate! Jessie!

1008
01:01:52.999 --> 01:01:53.999
Jessie!

1009
01:01:57.999 --> 01:01:59.999
Kate, come in. Come on, please.

1010
01:02:01.999 --> 01:02:02.999
Come on, guys, please.

1011
01:02:03.999 --> 01:02:05.999
-Kate!
-Rob?

1012
01:02:06.999 --> 01:02:08.999
-Kate?
-Where are they?

1013
01:02:08.999 --> 01:02:09.999
-Here they are. Come on.
-Rob!

1014
01:02:11.999 --> 01:02:12.999
-Rob!
-Dad!

1015
01:02:13.999 --> 01:02:14.999
Rob!

1016
01:02:16.999 --> 01:02:17.999
-Jessie!
-Dad!

1017
01:02:19.999 --> 01:02:20.999
Dad!

1018
01:02:20.999 --> 01:02:21.999
Oh, God. Oh.

1019
01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:33.999
It's so good to see you.

1020
01:02:35.999 --> 01:02:37.999
We got your data.
Let's hope it's worth it.

1021
01:02:37.999 --> 01:02:39.999
It will be. They'll want this.

1022
01:02:39.999 --> 01:02:40.999
Come on.

1023
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.999
-Get in the truck. Go.
-Okay.

1024
01:02:42.999 --> 01:02:43.999
Let's go!

1025
01:02:48.999 --> 01:02:50.999
<i>I'm getting ready to land soon.</i>
<i>I need answers.</i>

1026
01:02:50.999 --> 01:02:51.999
How long do we have?

1027
01:02:51.999 --> 01:02:53.999
By our calculations...

1028
01:02:53.999 --> 01:02:54.999
the wave will hit
the Yellowstone Caldera...

1029
01:02:54.999 --> 01:02:57.999
in less than five hours
and twenty-five minutes.

1030
01:02:57.999 --> 01:02:58.999
Ah.

1031
01:02:59.999 --> 01:03:00.999
How do we stop this?

1032
01:03:01.999 --> 01:03:02.999
We're working on that, sir.

1033
01:03:05.999 --> 01:03:05.999
Work faster.

1034
01:03:17.999 --> 01:03:19.999
So what are you hoping
to do with all this data?

1035
01:03:19.999 --> 01:03:20.999
Quick, Jake,

1036
01:03:20.999 --> 01:03:23.999
if a tidal wave were coming for
the coast how would you stop it?

1037
01:03:23.999 --> 01:03:25.999
Is that a trick question?
You can't stop a tidal wave.

1038
01:03:25.999 --> 01:03:27.000
The theoretical one.
Theoretically, what would you do?

1039
01:03:27.999 --> 01:03:30.999
You'd open up a trench
in the bottom of the ocean.

1040
01:03:30.999 --> 01:03:32.999
The waves' energy would go down
to it, never reach the coast.

1041
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:33.999
It's actually right.

1042
01:03:36.999 --> 01:03:38.999
-I, I was gonna say that.
-Kate, Kate.

1043
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.999
I, I already told you, okay?

1044
01:03:40.999 --> 01:03:42.999
That would require
a massive explosion.

1045
01:03:42.999 --> 01:03:44.999
And we're talking nuclear.

1046
01:03:44.999 --> 01:03:47.999
Yes. At the exact time
and exact location.

1047
01:03:47.999 --> 01:03:48.999
It's the only way
to counteract the wave.

1048
01:03:48.999 --> 01:03:50.999
Without this we have nothing.

1049
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Oh, oh, right, right.
Plan B. Yeah.

1050
01:03:53.999 --> 01:03:54.999
How, how is Plan B coming?

1051
01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:56.999
Plan B.

1052
01:03:59.999 --> 01:04:00.999
Hey, I need Pierce.

1053
01:04:05.999 --> 01:04:06.999
Sir.

1054
01:04:06.999 --> 01:04:08.999
-Yes?
-You have a phone call.

1055
01:04:08.999 --> 01:04:09.999
Yeah. Well, I'm kinda busy here.

1056
01:04:09.999 --> 01:04:12.999
Yes, I told her that,
but she said it's urgent.

1057
01:04:12.999 --> 01:04:13.999
Very urgent.

1058
01:04:14.999 --> 01:04:17.999
Her? Who?

1059
01:04:17.999 --> 01:04:17.999
The professor.

1060
01:04:20.999 --> 01:04:22.999
-Okay. Put her through.
-Yes, sir.

1061
01:04:33.999 --> 01:04:35.999
Professor, I'm so glad
to hear from you.

1062
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.999
I'm here with
your little buddy, Drew.

1063
01:04:39.999 --> 01:04:41.999
Kate, Pierce knows
what I sent you.

1064
01:04:42.999 --> 01:04:43.000
Drew, are you okay?

1065
01:04:43.999 --> 01:04:48.999
<i>Ah, I'm at about a ten on</i>
<i>the pain on the hospital scales.</i>

1066
01:04:48.999 --> 01:04:49.999
Yes, we were just telling him...

1067
01:04:49.999 --> 01:04:51.999
how much we really
don't like treason over here.

1068
01:04:52.999 --> 01:04:54.999
It was a physical demonstration.

1069
01:04:55.999 --> 01:04:57.999
<i>Pierce, you son of a bitch,</i>
<i>you listen to me.</i>

1070
01:04:57.999 --> 01:04:59.999
Drew didn't just send me
info on Hellstorm.

1071
01:04:59.999 --> 01:05:01.999
I have everything.
I have all the data.

1072
01:05:01.999 --> 01:05:03.999
<i>I have all the files.</i>
<i>I have proof.</i>

1073
01:05:04.999 --> 01:05:05.999
<i>Proof that you knew</i>
<i>there was a weapon.</i>

1074
01:05:05.999 --> 01:05:07.999
Proof that sensitive files were
hacked out of your office...

1075
01:05:07.999 --> 01:05:08.999
and given into enemy hands.

1076
01:05:08.999 --> 01:05:10.999
Proof that when
you went in to save it...

1077
01:05:10.999 --> 01:05:12.999
<i>all you ended up doing</i>
<i>was turning it on.</i>

1078
01:05:12.999 --> 01:05:14.000
<i>You have blood</i>
<i>all over your hands.</i>

1079
01:05:14.999 --> 01:05:15.999
<i>Your hands are covered in blood.</i>

1080
01:05:17.999 --> 01:05:18.999
That does not sound good.

1081
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.999
<i>Phil, listen, we can</i>
<i>make a deal right now...</i>

1082
01:05:21.999 --> 01:05:23.999
before this gets
any worse and trust me,

1083
01:05:23.999 --> 01:05:25.999
it's going to get worse.
I can stop it...

1084
01:05:25.999 --> 01:05:27.999
but I need
the help of the US Military.

1085
01:05:28.999 --> 01:05:31.999
Military? W, w, what
exactly are you proposing?

1086
01:05:32.999 --> 01:05:34.000
<i>I need a device</i>
<i>that is capable...</i>

1087
01:05:34.999 --> 01:05:36.999
of delivering the equivalent
of one kilo ton explosion.

1088
01:05:36.999 --> 01:05:37.999
<i>Ah.</i>

1089
01:05:38.999 --> 01:05:39.999
<i>Are you joking? That's...</i>

1090
01:05:40.999 --> 01:05:42.000
You're talking about
a small nuclear device.

1091
01:05:42.999 --> 01:05:43.999
On US soil, no less.

1092
01:05:43.999 --> 01:05:46.999
<i>Yes, I am, and you have it but</i>
<i>I'm talking about a fair trade.</i>

1093
01:05:46.999 --> 01:05:49.999
All of the files for
all of your help plus Drew.

1094
01:05:53.999 --> 01:05:56.999
You're talking
about nuclear munitions.

1095
01:05:57.999 --> 01:05:59.999
<i>Hellstorm isn't stopping.</i>

1096
01:05:59.999 --> 01:06:01.999
If this wave activity
ignites Yellowstone...

1097
01:06:01.999 --> 01:06:04.999
it is an end-game scenario.
This is as bad as it gets.

1098
01:06:14.999 --> 01:06:15.000
You're right.

1099
01:06:16.999 --> 01:06:17.999
I'm sorry, come again.

1100
01:06:18.999 --> 01:06:20.999
The device will reach
the Yellowstone Caldera...

1101
01:06:20.999 --> 01:06:21.999
in a little over five hours.

1102
01:06:22.999 --> 01:06:25.999
<i>Okay, yes, but given the right</i>
<i>tools we can stop it here.</i>

1103
01:06:25.999 --> 01:06:27.999
Now, what kind of power
do you think I have?

1104
01:06:28.999 --> 01:06:30.000
<i>You have enough assets</i>
<i>at your disposal.</i>

1105
01:06:30.999 --> 01:06:30.999
You didn't listen to me once.

1106
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Don't make
the same mistake again.

1107
01:06:32.999 --> 01:06:33.999
We are running out of time.

1108
01:06:35.999 --> 01:06:36.999
Uh...

1109
01:06:38.999 --> 01:06:39.999
I'll get back to you.

1110
01:06:43.999 --> 01:06:45.999
You gotta like her style.

1111
01:06:46.999 --> 01:06:49.999
Now, am I free to go?

1112
01:06:52.999 --> 01:06:53.999
Not exactly.

1113
01:07:00.999 --> 01:07:02.999
If this is gonna work,
we gotta get underground.

1114
01:07:04.999 --> 01:07:04.999
Yeah.

1115
01:07:06.999 --> 01:07:07.999
There's a tunnel system.

1116
01:07:08.999 --> 01:07:09.999
Inside the old mines,
not too far from here.

1117
01:07:10.999 --> 01:07:11.999
I think it might be deep enough.

1118
01:07:12.999 --> 01:07:13.999
What are we waiting for?

1119
01:07:14.999 --> 01:07:15.999
Let's go.

1120
01:07:18.999 --> 01:07:19.999
<i>I don't think it's a bad idea.</i>

1121
01:07:21.999 --> 01:07:22.999
<i>This could be a win-win.</i>

1122
01:07:23.999 --> 01:07:25.999
<i>Assemble her a team. Give</i>
<i>her the requested assets.</i>

1123
01:07:26.999 --> 01:07:27.999
<i>If she's right,</i>

1124
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.999
<i>it's gonna all clean up</i>
<i>quite nicely.</i>

1125
01:07:30.999 --> 01:07:31.999
<i>Like I said,</i>

1126
01:07:32.999 --> 01:07:34.999
<i>I want this mess</i>
<i>scrubbed and sanitized.</i>

1127
01:07:36.999 --> 01:07:37.999
And if she's wrong?

1128
01:07:39.999 --> 01:07:41.999
<i>Then nothing's</i>
<i>gonna matter, anyway.</i>

1129
01:07:42.999 --> 01:07:43.999
We're all screwed.

1130
01:07:45.999 --> 01:07:47.999
<i>The professor's been</i>
<i>informed of you arrival.</i>

1131
01:07:47.999 --> 01:07:49.000
<i>We'll send in exact coordinates.</i>

1132
01:07:49.999 --> 01:07:51.999
Hey, we're counting
on you to make sure...

1133
01:07:51.999 --> 01:07:53.999
that payload reaches
her safely, huh?

1134
01:07:54.999 --> 01:07:55.999
Roger that. I'm on it, sir.

1135
01:08:36.999 --> 01:08:37.999
It's coming closer.

1136
01:08:38.999 --> 01:08:39.999
Hey.

1137
01:08:46.999 --> 01:08:47.999
Well, it's safe for now.

1138
01:08:49.999 --> 01:08:50.999
A few more tremors, I don't know.

1139
01:08:51.999 --> 01:08:53.000
The whole place feels like
it's gonna come down.

1140
01:08:55.999 --> 01:08:57.999
A few more quakes and
the whole place will come down.

1141
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.999
We're not even sure
this thing's gonna show up.

1142
01:09:01.999 --> 01:09:03.000
I really don't wanna
be here anymore.

1143
01:09:12.999 --> 01:09:13.999
That answers our question.

1144
01:09:14.999 --> 01:09:15.999
Is that Plan B?

1145
01:09:15.999 --> 01:09:16.999
Let's hope so.

1146
01:09:21.999 --> 01:09:22.999
What are you doin'?

1147
01:09:23.999 --> 01:09:24.999
Penny!

1148
01:09:25.999 --> 01:09:26.999
Penny!

1149
01:09:28.999 --> 01:09:30.999
Hey, are you okay?

1150
01:09:30.999 --> 01:09:31.999
What did they do to you? Hey!

1151
01:09:35.999 --> 01:09:37.999
Stop. Come on, you can't do this.

1152
01:09:37.999 --> 01:09:38.999
You can't do this.

1153
01:09:41.999 --> 01:09:44.999
No, no, no. No, no, no.
No, no, no.

1154
01:09:44.999 --> 01:09:46.999
You can't. Come on. Stop.

1155
01:09:47.999 --> 01:09:50.999
-Sorry. Loose ends.
-No!

1156
01:09:54.999 --> 01:09:55.999
Didn't think I'd see
you again so soon.

1157
01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
That's good luck.
Started in the desert.

1158
01:09:58.999 --> 01:09:59.999
Hopefully it'll end right here.

1159
01:09:59.999 --> 01:10:00.999
Let's hope for that.

1160
01:10:04.999 --> 01:10:06.999
-Where they goin'?
-Protocol.

1161
01:10:07.999 --> 01:10:09.999
They'll be back in the evac,
it's gonna be time.

1162
01:10:09.999 --> 01:10:10.999
They better be.

1163
01:10:11.999 --> 01:10:13.999
That's Jameson,
our bomb tech, as ordered.

1164
01:10:17.999 --> 01:10:19.999
I hope you guys know
what you're doing.

1165
01:10:20.999 --> 01:10:21.999
So you have a nuclear bomb
inside that thing?

1166
01:10:22.999 --> 01:10:24.999
Yeah, it's a one SADM.

1167
01:10:24.999 --> 01:10:26.999
Special Atomic
Demolition Munitions.

1168
01:10:26.999 --> 01:10:28.999
Capable of one kilo ton
detonation.

1169
01:10:28.999 --> 01:10:30.999
Ma'am, I was told you're
the one with the where and when.

1170
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.999
You're gonna go about
a mile down in there...

1171
01:10:32.999 --> 01:10:33.999
and we're running out of time...

1172
01:10:33.999 --> 01:10:35.999
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We can't go down mile...

1173
01:10:35.999 --> 01:10:37.999
in that thing for
a remote detonation.

1174
01:10:38.999 --> 01:10:40.999
I'm assuming that we're
not all goin' down there.

1175
01:10:40.999 --> 01:10:41.999
No, they're stayin' here.

1176
01:10:42.999 --> 01:10:43.999
Here.

1177
01:10:43.999 --> 01:10:45.999
Relax. Be right back.

1178
01:10:48.999 --> 01:10:51.999
Look, I know it's cliche, kid,
just push the red button, okay?

1179
01:10:52.999 --> 01:10:54.999
Push the red button.

1180
01:10:54.999 --> 01:10:56.000
I'm not pressing anything.

1181
01:10:56.999 --> 01:10:57.999
No, you have to, sweetie.

1182
01:10:57.999 --> 01:11:00.999
Look, kid, it's not gonna
detonate anything.

1183
01:11:00.999 --> 01:11:01.999
It's just gonna
set off the timer.

1184
01:11:01.999 --> 01:11:03.999
You'll be alright. You can do it.

1185
01:11:04.999 --> 01:11:06.999
-I can't do this.
-Hey, look.

1186
01:11:06.999 --> 01:11:07.999
This isn't you painting
yourself green...

1187
01:11:07.999 --> 01:11:08.999
and starting
some political statement.

1188
01:11:08.999 --> 01:11:09.999
You know about that?

1189
01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:12.999
I do. And I'm proud of you,
and I know you don't know that.

1190
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.999
And I need to do
a lot of things differently...

1191
01:11:15.999 --> 01:11:17.999
but right now
this is a sacrifice...

1192
01:11:17.999 --> 01:11:19.999
and I need you to be strong.
Can you do that?

1193
01:11:20.999 --> 01:11:21.999
Yes.

1194
01:11:22.999 --> 01:11:23.999
-Okay.
-Mom?

1195
01:11:24.999 --> 01:11:25.999
I love you.

1196
01:11:28.999 --> 01:11:31.999
I hate to be the one to break
this up but we gotta go.

1197
01:11:33.999 --> 01:11:34.999
Hold that thought, okay?

1198
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:36.999
You can do this.

1199
01:11:37.999 --> 01:11:38.999
I love you.

1200
01:11:45.999 --> 01:11:47.999
Man, I really hope this works.

1201
01:11:51.999 --> 01:11:52.999
-You're okay?
-Yes.

1202
01:11:53.999 --> 01:11:54.999
-Let's go. Go, go.
-Go.

1203
01:11:59.999 --> 01:12:01.999
<i>We do not know</i>
<i>the full extent of damage...</i>

1204
01:12:12.999 --> 01:12:13.999
-We're running out of time.
-Yeah.

1205
01:12:15.999 --> 01:12:17.999
Base to Bird. Base to Bird.

1206
01:12:18.999 --> 01:12:19.999
Come in. Over.

1207
01:12:24.999 --> 01:12:26.999
Base to Bird. Base to Bird.
Come in, Bird.

1208
01:12:28.999 --> 01:12:30.000
<i>This is Bird, sir.</i>

1209
01:12:30.999 --> 01:12:32.999
<i>I'm still in a holding pattern</i>
<i>above the fault line.</i>

1210
01:12:32.999 --> 01:12:34.999
<i>And I have the package, en route.</i>

1211
01:12:34.999 --> 01:12:36.999
<i>The entire area is unstable, sir.</i>

1212
01:12:38.999 --> 01:12:38.999
Copy that.

1213
01:12:41.999 --> 01:12:42.999
Three hours and counting, sir.

1214
01:12:50.999 --> 01:12:52.999
Come on, man.
Keep movin'. Keep movin'.

1215
01:12:52.999 --> 01:12:53.999
Yeah, yeah.

1216
01:12:54.999 --> 01:12:55.999
I say we go over
to my house. Let's go.

1217
01:13:00.999 --> 01:13:01.999
Right there.

1218
01:13:07.999 --> 01:13:09.999
-You okay?
-Yeah. Okay.

1219
01:13:09.999 --> 01:13:10.999
I can activate the bomb...

1220
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.999
but you're gonna
have to tell me when.

1221
01:13:32.999 --> 01:13:34.000
Wait, wait, it's close.

1222
01:13:34.999 --> 01:13:35.999
Just hold on.

1223
01:13:36.999 --> 01:13:39.999
We are primed and ready.

1224
01:13:39.999 --> 01:13:40.999
No, not yet, it has to be
at the exact time...

1225
01:13:40.999 --> 01:13:42.999
or this whole thing is worthless.

1226
01:13:42.999 --> 01:13:43.999
Yeah, well,
if we don't detonate soon...

1227
01:13:43.999 --> 01:13:44.999
we're all gonna be worthless.

1228
01:13:45.999 --> 01:13:48.999
Hope you're right about
those calculations, doc.

1229
01:13:48.999 --> 01:13:49.999
She is.

1230
01:13:53.999 --> 01:13:55.999
<i>Base to Bird. Come in. Over.</i>

1231
01:13:55.999 --> 01:13:57.999
<i>This is Bird. I've got explosions</i>
<i>all around me.</i>

1232
01:14:01.999 --> 01:14:02.999
Damn it!

1233
01:14:19.999 --> 01:14:21.999
I hate to break it to you guys,
but we got to go right now.

1234
01:14:22.999 --> 01:14:23.999
Kate?

1235
01:14:27.999 --> 01:14:29.999
<i>Jessie, hit the button now.</i>
<i>Jessie, hit the button.</i>

1236
01:14:30.999 --> 01:14:31.999
You have to hit it.
You heard her.

1237
01:14:31.999 --> 01:14:32.999
I can't leave them in there.

1238
01:14:32.999 --> 01:14:34.999
-I can't.
-You have to.

1239
01:14:34.999 --> 01:14:34.999
They're my family.

1240
01:14:34.999 --> 01:14:36.999
It's our orders,
and we need to follow them.

1241
01:14:36.999 --> 01:14:38.999
Jessie,
they'll have time to get out...

1242
01:14:38.999 --> 01:14:39.999
but you'll have to
start the timer.

1243
01:14:39.999 --> 01:14:41.999
It's gonna be okay.
Press the button.

1244
01:14:45.999 --> 01:14:47.999
Jessie, you can do this.

1245
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:50.999
Go on.

1246
01:14:54.999 --> 01:14:55.999
She did it.

1247
01:14:55.999 --> 01:14:56.999
Let's go.

1248
01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.999
The new detonation's
been set, sir.

1249
01:15:03.999 --> 01:15:05.999
Alright, let's get out of here.

1250
01:15:05.999 --> 01:15:07.000
Oh, you're not going anywhere.

1251
01:15:07.999 --> 01:15:07.999
What are you doing?

1252
01:15:09.999 --> 01:15:09.999
Just following orders.

1253
01:15:18.999 --> 01:15:19.999
-No!
-No!

1254
01:15:24.999 --> 01:15:25.999
Traitor.

1255
01:15:27.999 --> 01:15:28.999
Come on guys. We got to go.

1256
01:15:30.999 --> 01:15:32.999
Alright? We didn't have a choice.

1257
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.999
We got to get out of here.

1258
01:15:35.999 --> 01:15:37.999
We can't leave them.

1259
01:15:37.999 --> 01:15:38.999
We have to get to the helicopter.

1260
01:15:42.999 --> 01:15:43.999
Let's go, come on.

1261
01:15:44.999 --> 01:15:45.999
Come on.

1262
01:15:45.999 --> 01:15:48.999
Go. We have to go.
Come on. Let's go.

1263
01:15:49.999 --> 01:15:50.999
Mom.

1264
01:15:53.999 --> 01:15:55.000
There's no evac!

1265
01:15:58.999 --> 01:15:59.999
I don't see a helicopter.

1266
01:16:00.999 --> 01:16:02.999
They said
they were coming back.

1267
01:16:02.999 --> 01:16:03.999
Do you see a helicopter?

1268
01:16:06.999 --> 01:16:08.999
No. No, they left us!

1269
01:16:08.999 --> 01:16:09.999
No!

1270
01:16:12.999 --> 01:16:13.999
Come on.

1271
01:16:28.999 --> 01:16:29.999
That's big.

1272
01:16:41.999 --> 01:16:43.999
That's it.
That's the exit. Go! Go!

1273
01:16:49.999 --> 01:16:51.999
Mom. Dad!

1274
01:16:52.999 --> 01:16:53.999
Dad. Mom.

1275
01:16:53.999 --> 01:16:56.000
-Jessie! No! Jessie!
-No, mom.

1276
01:16:56.999 --> 01:16:57.999
We gotta go. We have to go.

1277
01:16:57.999 --> 01:16:58.999
-Dad!
-Come on.

1278
01:16:58.999 --> 01:16:59.999
Mom!

1279
01:17:01.999 --> 01:17:03.000
Dad! Mom!

1280
01:17:03.999 --> 01:17:04.999
Mom!

1281
01:17:07.999 --> 01:17:09.999
What happened to the helicopter?

1282
01:17:09.999 --> 01:17:11.999
There is no helicopter.
It was a set up.

1283
01:17:11.999 --> 01:17:13.999
There's a truck. There's a truck.

1284
01:17:20.999 --> 01:17:21.999
Everybody hang on!

1285
01:17:51.999 --> 01:17:53.999
No!

1286
01:17:57.999 --> 01:17:58.000
Faster!
We're running out of time!

1287
01:17:58.999 --> 01:17:59.999
We're not clear
of the blast radius.

1288
01:17:59.999 --> 01:18:01.999
Come on, come on!

1289
01:18:01.999 --> 01:18:02.999
How do we know when we are clear?

1290
01:18:02.999 --> 01:18:03.999
Well, we're not dead. Move!

1291
01:18:03.999 --> 01:18:04.999
I'm moving!

1292
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.999
Go!

1293
01:18:15.999 --> 01:18:16.999
How much time do we have?

1294
01:18:19.999 --> 01:18:20.999
None!

1295
01:19:45.999 --> 01:19:46.999
So, is it over?

1296
01:19:47.999 --> 01:19:48.999
Yeah.

1297
01:19:48.999 --> 01:19:49.999
It's over.

1298
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:53.999
How do you know?

1299
01:19:56.999 --> 01:19:57.999
Well,

1300
01:19:57.999 --> 01:20:00.999
'cause she has this nasty habit
of always being right.

1301
01:20:02.999 --> 01:20:03.999
Not about everything.

1302
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:06.999
You okay, doc.

1303
01:20:07.999 --> 01:20:09.999
Our country could use
more people like you.

1304
01:20:12.999 --> 01:20:14.000
I think she made her sacrifice.

1305
01:20:16.999 --> 01:20:17.999
I think we all did.

1306
01:20:24.999 --> 01:20:25.999
It's time to go.

1307
01:20:26.999 --> 01:20:27.999
Hey, professor?

1308
01:20:29.999 --> 01:20:30.999
Am I going to get
extra credit for this?

1309
01:20:32.999 --> 01:20:34.999
Right. Never mind.
I'll ask, I'll ask you later.
