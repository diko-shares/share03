00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.574
<i>In Paris, the CAC 40 losing seven,
a weaker franc weighing on the market.</i>

6
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.167
Thank you, Ilsa.

7
00:03:15.302 --> 00:03:17.760
Have a nice day.

8
00:03:29.316 --> 00:03:32.650
<i>...actually are on time this morning,

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.481
<i>San Francisco's freeways are...</i>

10
00:03:50.838 --> 00:03:53.758
<i>- Morning, sir.
- Well, tell me what we're supposed to do.</i>

11
00:03:53.841 --> 00:03:55.878
<i>I mean, you may be perched on majority shares</i>

12
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.173
<i>but we all get fucked if the actuals crash.</i>

13
00:03:59.346 --> 00:04:01.178
<i>That old man is gonna sink us.</i>

14
00:04:01.348 --> 00:04:03.965
Soon as I have Baer-Grant's P&L report in hand

15
00:04:04.101 --> 00:04:06.388
I will be speed-dialing your number.

16
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.854
<i>- Is that a promise?</i>
- I'm sorry. I'm not aware of that term.

17
00:04:10.024 --> 00:04:13.642
<i>Well, what do I do if Anson calls
about a substantiation procedure?</i>

18
00:04:13.778 --> 00:04:16.566
Take evasive action.
Have your secretary say you're in a meeting.

19
00:04:16.697 --> 00:04:19.064
Thank you, Jack. Yes, Maria?

20
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.941
- Invitations.
- Mm-hmm.

21
00:04:21.077 --> 00:04:22.693
- The museum gala?
- No.

22
00:04:22.828 --> 00:04:25.035
The Fitzwilliam Botanical annual fundraiser?

23
00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:27.496
- No.
- The Hinchberger wedding.

24
00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:30.037
Hinchberger wedding?

25
00:04:30.211 --> 00:04:33.124
Tuxedos, droning conversations,
I don't think so, no.

26
00:04:33.255 --> 00:04:35.087
I'll send your regrets.

27
00:04:35.216 --> 00:04:37.332
Honestly, why must I bother?

28
00:04:37.468 --> 00:04:41.928
You don't know about society, Maria.
You don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.

29
00:04:42.056 --> 00:04:44.297
Yes?

30
00:04:44.433 --> 00:04:46.094
I have an Elizabeth on line three.

31
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.138
- Your ex-Wife.
- I know who it is.

32
00:04:51.273 --> 00:04:53.810
Take a message.

33
00:04:53.943 --> 00:04:56.810
Oh, happy birthday, sir.

34
00:04:56.946 --> 00:04:58.436
Thank you, Maggie.

35
00:05:01.784 --> 00:05:03.491
I don't like her.

36
00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:06.737
I wouldn't even mention the following,
but he was very insistent.

37
00:05:06.872 --> 00:05:09.159
- It's obviously some sort of prank.
- What'?

38
00:05:09.291 --> 00:05:11.453
Well, a gentleman called
requesting lunch with you.

39
00:05:11.585 --> 00:05:13.451
I tried to assure him that you were very busy.

40
00:05:13.587 --> 00:05:16.124
- What's his name?
- A Mr. Seymour Butts.

41
00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:21.797
"Under the Bleachers, by Seymour Butts..."

42
00:05:21.929 --> 00:05:24.261
I'm sorry?

43
00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:26.968
Cancel my lunch.
Make a reservation at the City Club...

44
00:05:27.101 --> 00:05:30.219
for myself and Mr. Butts, my usual table.

45
00:05:32.273 --> 00:05:34.765
Maria, put the reservation under my name.

46
00:05:39.488 --> 00:05:42.856
- Are you ready to order, sir?
- No, I'm still waiting.

47
00:05:42.992 --> 00:05:45.450
This was iced tea.

48
00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:53.450
Conrad. What a surprise.

49
00:05:53.586 --> 00:05:55.293
Happy birthday, Nicky.

50
00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:58.959
"Seymour Butts."
I'll never get tired of that one.

51
00:05:59.133 --> 00:06:00.840
That's why it's a classic.

52
00:06:00.968 --> 00:06:04.586
- This is a nice restaurant. They gave me a free jacket.
- I'm sure they're gonna want it back.

53
00:06:04.722 --> 00:06:08.431
- I remember being here a long time ago.
- Yeah, I took you here once.

54
00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:11.176
No. I used to buy crystal meth off the maitre d'.

55
00:06:11.312 --> 00:06:13.144
- Oh, really?
- In college.

56
00:06:13.314 --> 00:06:14.930
Which college?

57
00:06:15.065 --> 00:06:18.274
Touché. Miss me?

58
00:06:18.402 --> 00:06:21.815
As much as that's possible. You look good.

59
00:06:21.947 --> 00:06:24.780
So do you. To think I was worried.

60
00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:28.368
- Worried about me?
- How long has it been since Mom's funeral?

61
00:06:28.495 --> 00:06:31.112
Two, three years?

62
00:06:31.248 --> 00:06:33.990
- I thought you quit.
- I did. It didn't take.

63
00:06:34.168 --> 00:06:35.784
Well, you can't smoke here.

64
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.752
I'm with you.

65
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.998
It's illegal to smoke
in restaurants in California.

66
00:06:41.133 --> 00:06:44.296
Fuck California.

67
00:06:44.428 --> 00:06:47.090
- How are you?
- Couldn't be better.

68
00:06:47.223 --> 00:06:49.555
- Elizabeth?
- We're divorced.

69
00:06:49.683 --> 00:06:53.597
She remarried a pediatrician, or a
gynecologist, or a pediatric gynecologist.

70
00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:55.311
Lives in Sausalito.

71
00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:59.103
That's too bad. I liked her.

72
00:06:59.235 --> 00:07:01.442
And what about you?

73
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.607
What, you don't keep track of me anymore?

74
00:07:03.739 --> 00:07:06.322
Not since family week at rehab.

75
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.532
So what brings you to town, Conrad?

76
00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:11.073
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

77
00:07:11.205 --> 00:07:12.821
- Need anything?
- No.

78
00:07:12.957 --> 00:07:15.665
- Really?
- No, I don't need anything from you.

79
00:07:15.793 --> 00:07:19.036
I just... found myself
laying naked on a beach near Ibiza...

80
00:07:19.171 --> 00:07:21.128
and all of a sudden it clicked.

81
00:07:21.257 --> 00:07:24.045
October 12, Nicky's birthday.

82
00:07:24.176 --> 00:07:25.666
October 11th.

83
00:07:25.803 --> 00:07:27.635
Whatever.

84
00:07:28.722 --> 00:07:30.804
 

85
00:07:32.059 --> 00:07:33.891
- This is for you.
- You shouldn't have.

86
00:07:35.396 --> 00:07:39.060
Well, what do you get
for the man who has everything?

87
00:07:42.903 --> 00:07:45.190
"Consumer Recreation Services."

88
00:07:45.322 --> 00:07:48.360
- Well, I do have golf clubs.
- Call that number.

89
00:07:48.492 --> 00:07:50.950
Why?

90
00:07:51.078 --> 00:07:52.944
They make your life fun.

91
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.412
- "Fun"?
- You know what that is?

92
00:07:55.582 --> 00:07:57.243
You've seen other people have it.

93
00:07:57.376 --> 00:08:01.415
- It's an entertainment service.
- An escort service?

94
00:08:02.464 --> 00:08:05.422
A profound life experience.

95
00:08:06.468 --> 00:08:08.584
- Sorry. Uh...
- No, that's all right.

96
00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:11.884
- Just...
- Tell me you'll call.

97
00:08:12.016 --> 00:08:14.098
- I said I would.
- No, you didn't.

98
00:08:15.894 --> 00:08:18.556
You still on medication?

99
00:08:19.606 --> 00:08:21.847
- Why would you say that?
- You gentlemen ready to order?

100
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.518
- I didn't mean it the way it sounded.
- I'm not on anything.

101
00:08:25.654 --> 00:08:27.395
I'm not even seeing a shrink.

102
00:08:27.531 --> 00:08:29.272
And I feel great. Do you mind?

103
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.203
I think you'll like this. I did.

104
00:08:36.332 --> 00:08:38.915
And it was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

105
00:08:39.043 --> 00:08:42.286
- I'll call, hmm?
- Do it. For you.

106
00:08:42.421 --> 00:08:44.958
I said I'll call, okay? All right, I'll call.

107
00:08:45.132 --> 00:08:47.794
It's just that, uh, I hate surprises.

108
00:08:49.011 --> 00:08:51.503
I know.

Oh. I saw Conrad today.

Did you? How is he?

122
00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:38.193
He's okay. I think he's in one of those...

personal improvement cults or something.

124
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.072

<i>Why do I call?</i>

144
00:12:10.003 --> 00:12:12.119

- I received this...

00:14:25.555 --> 00:14:28.092
Just a moment.

174
00:14:28.225 --> 00:14:30.637
I'm sorry you feel that way.

175
00:14:30.769 --> 00:14:33.636
I understand. We hope we haven't
caused you any inconvenience.

176
00:14:33.814 --> 00:14:35.646
Thank you for choosing CRS.

177
00:14:35.774 --> 00:14:38.766
Mr. Feingold, could you assist this gentleman?

178
00:14:38.902 --> 00:14:41.815
Oh, yeah. Sure.

179
00:14:41.988 --> 00:14:44.275
Jim Feingold, VP, engineering and data analysis.

180
00:14:44.408 --> 00:14:47.025
I don't know exactly how this works.
My brother sent me this card.

181
00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.492
Oh, here we go. Yeah. All right. Excellent.

182
00:14:49.663 --> 00:14:51.654
Well, let's get started.

183
00:14:51.832 --> 00:14:54.039
Yeah, I'm sorry about, you know...

184
00:14:54.167 --> 00:14:56.534
all this hullabaloo here.

185
00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.286
We're still moving.

186
00:14:58.422 --> 00:15:01.210
I got an office around here somewhere.

187
00:15:01.341 --> 00:15:03.673
 

188
00:15:03.844 --> 00:15:05.801
You mind holding that?

189
00:15:06.888 --> 00:15:09.050
Thank you very much.

190
00:15:09.182 --> 00:15:11.173
Okay.

191
00:15:11.309 --> 00:15:14.347
Thank you. Are you hungry? New Moon Cafe.

192
00:15:14.521 --> 00:15:17.138
- No, thank you.
- Best in Chinatown.

193
00:15:21.695 --> 00:15:25.404
A gift from Conrad Van Orton.

194
00:15:25.532 --> 00:15:27.648
- Interesting.
- What is?

195
00:15:27.784 --> 00:15:30.902
Well, your brother was a
client with our London branch.

196
00:15:31.037 --> 00:15:34.951
We do a sort of informal scoring,
and his numbers were outstanding.

197
00:15:35.083 --> 00:15:36.915
Really? Hmm.

198
00:15:37.043 --> 00:15:38.909
- You sure you're not hungry?
- No, thank you.

199
00:15:39.045 --> 00:15:42.629
Okay, fine. Now,
you need to fill out these forms.

200
00:15:42.758 --> 00:15:44.419
There's an application,

201
00:15:44.551 --> 00:15:47.509
and a couple of psych tests there,
the MMPI and the PAP.

202
00:15:47.637 --> 00:15:49.503
Oh, for the financial questionnaire...

203
00:15:49.639 --> 00:15:52.097
don't answer anything you don't feel like.

204
00:15:52.225 --> 00:15:55.058
We'll run a TRW.

205
00:15:55.187 --> 00:15:58.054
"I sometimes hurt small animals. True or false?"

206
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.767
"I feel guilty when I masturbate."

207
00:16:02.903 --> 00:16:05.736
Well, I don't write the questions.

208
00:16:05.864 --> 00:16:08.731
I just review the answers.

209
00:16:12.537 --> 00:16:16.371
- What is this for?
- Well, to give us an overall
sense of your capabilities.

210
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.709
No, what is this for? What are you selling?

211
00:16:20.796 --> 00:16:22.912
Oh. It's a game.

212
00:16:23.048 --> 00:16:27.007
- A game?
- Specifically tailored for each participant.

213
00:16:27.135 --> 00:16:29.376
Think of it as a great vacation.

214
00:16:29.513 --> 00:16:32.050
Except you don't go to it, it comes to you.

215
00:16:32.182 --> 00:16:35.015
Well, what... what kind of vacation?

216
00:16:35.143 --> 00:16:36.554
It's different every time.

217
00:16:36.686 --> 00:16:39.303
Humor me with specifics.

218
00:16:39.439 --> 00:16:41.396
We provide...

219
00:16:43.443 --> 00:16:45.229
whatever's lacking.

220
00:16:45.362 --> 00:16:48.730
- And what if nothing is lacking?
- May I make two suggestions?

221
00:16:48.865 --> 00:16:52.233
You really think that I'll
participate without knowing any-

222
00:16:52.369 --> 00:16:55.782
First, admit to yourself
that it sounds intriguing.

223
00:16:55.914 --> 00:16:58.326
Second, you don't have to decide today.

224
00:16:58.458 --> 00:17:00.449
Take the silly tests, fill out the stupid forms.

225
00:17:00.627 --> 00:17:02.209
One day your game begins.

226
00:17:02.337 --> 00:17:05.295
You either love it or hate it. Decide then.

227
00:17:05.423 --> 00:17:08.586
You know, we're like...

228
00:17:08.718 --> 00:17:11.836
an experiential book-of-the-month club.

229
00:17:11.972 --> 00:17:15.556
You can drop out at any time
with no further obligation.

230
00:17:17.519 --> 00:17:19.476
That was my sales pitch.

231
00:17:19.604 --> 00:17:21.720
How long will this take?

232
00:17:21.857 --> 00:17:25.270
- About an hour for those,
another hour for the physical.
- "Physical"?

233
00:17:25.402 --> 00:17:27.609
It's a cursory examination.
Turn-your-head-and-cough sort of thing.

234
00:17:27.737 --> 00:17:30.729
You'll be out of here in no time.

235
00:18:18.788 --> 00:18:20.699
Confused.

236
00:18:25.754 --> 00:18:27.370
Risky.

237
00:18:31.509 --> 00:18:33.250
Bloody.

238
00:18:36.681 --> 00:18:39.173
Whoops.

239
00:18:58.662 --> 00:19:01.022
<i>Mr. Sutherland called
about Baer-Grant Publishing.</i>

240
00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:02.905
Cancel it. Push it back till Wednesday.

241
00:19:03.041 --> 00:19:04.907
<i>And Anson Baer called about tomorrow.</i>

242
00:19:05.085 --> 00:19:06.541
- Tomorrow?
- <i>Yes.</i>

243
00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:09.788
- How much longer is this gonna take?
- Shouldn't be long. You're almost done.

244
00:19:09.923 --> 00:19:13.041
You said that two hours ago.
All right. Put it back until tomorrow.

245
00:19:13.176 --> 00:19:15.793
<i>For the following emotional responses.</i>

246
00:19:15.929 --> 00:19:18.796
<i>You have point-nine seconds
to continue your emotional responses.</i>

247
00:19:18.932 --> 00:19:21.765
<i>Reaction time is a factor.</i>

248
00:19:24.562 --> 00:19:27.099
<i>Please make a selection for
the following emotional responses.</i>

249
00:19:27.232 --> 00:19:29.849
<i>You have point-nine seconds...</i>

250
00:19:33.905 --> 00:19:36.272
Does this thing end?

251
00:19:51.631 --> 00:19:53.963
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Oh, don't worry.

252
00:19:54.134 --> 00:19:57.468
It's been just terrific spending
my entire day with your crack team.

253
00:19:57.595 --> 00:20:00.804
Well, it's all down to this.
This is an insurance company requirement.

254
00:20:00.932 --> 00:20:02.969
It states that you're aware that the game exists

255
00:20:03.101 --> 00:20:06.061
and that you're a willing participant
in said game, and so on and so forth.

256
00:20:06.146 --> 00:20:09.480
Our guarantee. Payment's entirely
at your brother's discretion as a gift.

257
00:20:09.607 --> 00:20:11.473
It's dependent on your satisfaction.

258
00:20:11.609 --> 00:20:14.101
Does that mean if I'm not happy,
he doesn't have to pay?

259
00:20:14.237 --> 00:20:16.148
That's never happened.
We've never had an unsatisfied customer.

260
00:20:16.322 --> 00:20:18.404
I think you mean "dissatisfied."

261
00:20:18.533 --> 00:20:21.491
That's right. You're a left-brained
word fetishist. Initials, initials...

262
00:20:21.619 --> 00:20:24.327
and sign there... in blood.

263
00:20:24.456 --> 00:20:26.367
Just kidding.

264
00:20:27.709 --> 00:20:31.077
All right. Now, your copy will be
at the front desk in this folder...

265
00:20:31.212 --> 00:20:32.998
and, well, keep the pen.

266
00:20:33.131 --> 00:20:35.042
We'll let you know.

267
00:20:38.178 --> 00:20:40.670
<i>- What about Monday or Tuesday?
- No, that's bad for me.</i>

268
00:20:40.847 --> 00:20:44.806
<i>- Well, how about tonight?
- Well, I'm working all this evening.</i>

269
00:20:44.934 --> 00:20:48.052
<i>Wednesday's the only possibility right now.</i>

270
00:20:48.188 --> 00:20:50.771
<i>- You want to do dinner?
- Okay.</i>

271
00:20:50.899 --> 00:20:53.687
<i>By the way, I went to CRS.</i>

272
00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:55.942
<i>Really? What'd you think?</i>

273
00:20:56.071 --> 00:20:58.984
<i>Well, they seem just
a little bit disorganized.</i>

274
00:20:59.115 --> 00:21:02.198
<i>Well, when I did it in London,
they'd been around a while.</i>

275
00:21:02.327 --> 00:21:05.490
<i>- Are you gonna do this?
- Oh, I haven't decided yet.</i>

276
00:21:08.416 --> 00:21:12.205
<i>I'm telling you, it's like getting in on
the ground floor of the next Disneyland.</i>

277
00:21:12.378 --> 00:21:15.746
CRS won't go public. They're family-owned.

278
00:21:15.882 --> 00:21:17.964
Mm, stranger things have happened.

279
00:21:18.093 --> 00:21:21.006
No, they haven't, actually.

280
00:21:21.137 --> 00:21:24.380
They opened here, the game, in San Francisco?

281
00:21:24.557 --> 00:21:27.299
See? They're doing fine without any of us.

282
00:21:32.774 --> 00:21:34.685
- Nicholas, how are you?
- James, good evening.

283
00:21:34.818 --> 00:21:37.059
- Good evening, sir.
- Got new members here?

284
00:21:37.195 --> 00:21:39.653
Believe so, sir.

285
00:21:39.781 --> 00:21:42.398
- Put their next round on me.
- Gotcha, sir.

286
00:21:45.078 --> 00:21:47.069
No, no, no, no.

287
00:21:47.205 --> 00:21:50.698
Last time I played Pebble, I swore
I'd never pick up another club again.

288
00:21:51.876 --> 00:21:54.083
Well, speaking about games...

289
00:21:54.212 --> 00:21:57.000
I couldn't help but
overhear you talking about CRS.

290
00:21:59.717 --> 00:22:01.754
The reason I mention it is...

291
00:22:01.886 --> 00:22:04.173
I took the test today
at the Montgomery Street office.

292
00:22:04.305 --> 00:22:06.467
You did? Kudos.

293
00:22:06.599 --> 00:22:09.512
- So yours hasn't started yet?
- No, not yet.

294
00:22:09.644 --> 00:22:13.558
That was one of the questions
I had for you. What is it?

295
00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:16.728
- Ah, "What is it"?
- The eternal question.

296
00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:20.353
You know, I envy you. I wish I could go back...

297
00:22:20.488 --> 00:22:23.401
and do it for the first time, all over again.

298
00:22:25.702 --> 00:22:27.443
Here's to...

299
00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:29.486
new experiences.

300
00:22:32.792 --> 00:22:35.375
Mm. If you'll excuse me, I gotta go. Night, Ted.

301
00:22:35.503 --> 00:22:37.085
- Mm.
- Nicholas.

302
00:22:37.213 --> 00:22:39.250
Nice to meet you.

303
00:22:41.843 --> 00:22:44.050
So you played recently?

304
00:22:44.179 --> 00:22:46.045
Oh, about a year ago.

305
00:22:46.181 --> 00:22:49.264
I was working in Los Angeles.

306
00:22:49.392 --> 00:22:51.724
I hear the London office is very good too.

307
00:22:51.853 --> 00:22:54.811
Sounds like a lot of fantasy
role-playing nonsense though.

308
00:22:57.483 --> 00:22:59.144
You want to know what it is?

309
00:22:59.277 --> 00:23:01.689
What it's all about?

310
00:23:01.821 --> 00:23:05.530
John chapter 9, verse 25.

311
00:23:05.658 --> 00:23:09.822
I, um, haven't been to
Sunday school in a long time.

312
00:23:09.954 --> 00:23:11.865
"Whereas once I was blind...

313
00:23:11.998 --> 00:23:13.955
now I can see."

314
00:23:15.752 --> 00:23:17.789
Good night, Nicholas.

315
00:23:17.921 --> 00:23:19.707
Best of luck.

316
00:23:19.839 --> 00:23:21.796
Good night.

317
00:23:34.979 --> 00:23:39.064
If the Baer-Grant meeting...

318
00:23:39.192 --> 00:23:41.684
is not held tomorrow...

319
00:23:41.819 --> 00:23:44.311
it may as well not be held at all.

320
00:23:47.158 --> 00:23:49.991
When Mr. Van Orton boards
his plane on the morrow...

321
00:23:50.119 --> 00:23:52.577
he will have every agreement and addendum,

322
00:23:52.705 --> 00:23:55.663
the complete closing package, flawlessly revised.

323
00:23:55.792 --> 00:23:59.205
So you'll miss another opera
you would've slept during anyway.

324
00:23:59.337 --> 00:24:02.204
We now have an opportunity to
show our clients how well...

325
00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:05.924
we will rise to his exhilarating challenge.

326
00:24:06.052 --> 00:24:07.588
Yes?

327
00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.178
- Nicholas Van Orton?
- Who is this?

328
00:24:10.306 --> 00:24:13.264
- This is Cynthia from CRS.
- How'd you get this number?

329
00:24:13.393 --> 00:24:16.931
- We finished processing your application.
- Look, I'm in a meeting right now.

330
00:24:17.063 --> 00:24:19.395
I'm afraid it was rejected.

331
00:24:19.565 --> 00:24:22.273
- I beg your pardon'?
- You shouldn't feel this
reflects negatively on you.

332
00:24:22.402 --> 00:24:24.313
We hope we haven't caused you any inconvenience.

333
00:24:24.445 --> 00:24:26.937
- Oh, this is ridiculous.
- Thank you for thinking of CRS.

334
00:24:28.741 --> 00:24:30.231
Anything wrong?

335
00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:32.447
Uh, no, no. Nothing.

336
00:24:33.746 --> 00:24:35.612
You may hang up...

337
00:24:35.748 --> 00:24:37.955
or press pound for more options.

338
00:24:38.084 --> 00:24:41.418
<i>This is Conrad. Leave a message.</i>

339
00:24:41.546 --> 00:24:43.412
Yes, Connie, it's Nicholas.

340
00:24:43.548 --> 00:24:45.585
Give me a ring when you get in.

341
00:24:45.758 --> 00:24:47.123
Oh, uh...

342
00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.877
regarding your birthday present, uhm...

343
00:24:50.013 --> 00:24:51.879
things are a little crazy right now.

344
00:24:52.015 --> 00:24:54.131
I don't really know if
I can fit it in my schedule.

345
00:24:54.267 --> 00:24:56.679
But we'll talk about it at
dinner tomorrow. Thanks. Bye.

346
00:25:29.802 --> 00:25:31.418
Hello?

347
00:26:32.281 --> 00:26:35.364
<i>With the resulting rise of
unemployment and the decline</i>

348
00:26:35.493 --> 00:26:37.359
<i>in viable small businesses.</i>

349
00:26:37.495 --> 00:26:39.657
<i>Meanwhile, Republican leaders
argue that its passage<i>

350
00:26:39.789 --> 00:26:41.826
<i>would be the very stimulant</i>

351
00:26:41.958 --> 00:26:43.869
<i>that a sluggish economy needs.</i>

352
00:26:44.043 --> 00:26:47.581
<i>No one has expressed an opinion
as to how if will impact</i>

353
00:26:47.713 --> 00:26:50.080
<i>the pampered existence of Nicholas Van Orton.</i>

354
00:26:50.216 --> 00:26:53.425
<i>The one thing on which both
Democrats and Republicans seem to agree</i>

355
00:26:53.553 --> 00:26:55.965
<i>is that most Americans
harbor serious doubts...</i>

356
00:26:56.097 --> 00:26:57.963
<i>about the economic future.</i>

357
00:26:58.099 --> 00:27:01.387
<i>A recent poll suggests a
staggering fifty-seven percent</i>

358
00:27:01.561 --> 00:27:04.519
<i>of American workers believe
there is a very real chance</i>

359
00:27:04.647 --> 00:27:07.856
<i>they will be unemployed within
the next five to seven years.</i>

360
00:27:07.984 --> 00:27:09.645
<i>But what does that matter...</i>

361
00:27:09.777 --> 00:27:12.769
<i>to a bloated millionaire fat cat like you?</i>

362
00:27:12.905 --> 00:27:15.397
<i>In other financial news, stock markets</i>

363
00:27:15.533 --> 00:27:18.241
<i>rose both domestically and abroad today</i>

364
00:27:18.369 --> 00:27:20.729
<i>after the announcement
of stronger-than-expected earnings</i>

365
00:27:20.746 --> 00:27:22.908
<i>by several high-tech companies</i>

366
00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.908
<i>but dipped again reacting to reports
that Nicholas Van Orton had to sneeze.</i>

367
00:27:30.465 --> 00:27:34.174
<i>Are you gonna spend the rest of
the evening prying at that clown's mouth?</i>

368
00:27:36.137 --> 00:27:36.961
I-I-I don't...

369
00:27:36.962 --> 00:27:39.755
<i>It's frustrating for me if you don't--
if you don't pay attention.</i>

370
00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:43.217
What is this?

371
00:27:43.352 --> 00:27:47.016
<i>This is your game,
Nicholas, and welcome to it.</i>

372
00:27:48.441 --> 00:27:51.900
<i>I'm here to let you in
on a few ground rules.</i>

373
00:27:52.028 --> 00:27:54.645
<i>You received the very first key,
and others will follow.</i>

374
00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:57.192
<i>You'll never know where you'll find them...</i>

375
00:27:57.325 --> 00:27:59.282
<i>or how you'll need to use 'em.</i>

376
00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:03.324
- <i>So keep your eyes open.</i>
- How do you... You can see me?

377
00:28:03.456 --> 00:28:06.118
<i>Let us save the questions till afterwards.</i>

378
00:28:07.793 --> 00:28:10.706
How does this work?

379
00:28:10.838 --> 00:28:15.207
<i>There's a tiny camera
looking at you right now.</i>

380
00:28:16.636 --> 00:28:19.970
- That's impossible.
- <i>You're right. Impossible.</i>

381
00:28:20.139 --> 00:28:22.972
<i>You're having a conversation
with your television.</i>

382
00:28:25.811 --> 00:28:27.643
<i>It's miniaturized.</i>

383
00:28:30.399 --> 00:28:32.811
<i>Do you know how dangerous that is?</i>

384
00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:40.323
- Mr. Van Orton?
- <i>And in domestic news...</i>

385
00:28:40.451 --> 00:28:43.739
- Yes, Ilsa, what is it?
- Is everything all right?

386
00:28:43.871 --> 00:28:47.330
- Fine.
- <i>petroleum processing plant yesterday.</i>

387
00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:51.084
- Fine.
- I've finished for the evening.
Will you be needing anything else?

388
00:28:51.212 --> 00:28:53.954
No, I won't, Ilsa. Thank you. Good night.

389
00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:55.956
Good night, then.

390
00:28:56.092 --> 00:28:58.459
<i>In a petroleum processing plant yesterday.</i>

391
00:28:58.594 --> 00:29:01.427
<i>Several workers were injured
in the--who's that?</i>

392
00:29:01.556 --> 00:29:03.297
Never mind who that is.

393
00:29:03.432 --> 00:29:05.352
<i>You want to know
how a camera got into your home.</i>

394
00:29:05.476 --> 00:29:06.841
Yes, I would.

395
00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:16.351
<i>Cold.</i>

396
00:29:17.989 --> 00:29:19.946
<i>C-C-C-Colder.</i>

397
00:29:23.786 --> 00:29:25.493
<i>W- W-Warm.</i>

398
00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.537
<i>Warmer-r-r-r.</i>

399
00:29:46.892 --> 00:29:49.725
<i>Write this number down. It's a 24-hour</i>

400
00:29:49.854 --> 00:29:53.222
<i>Consumer Recreation Services
hotline for emergencies only.</i>

401
00:29:53.357 --> 00:29:56.566
<i>But don't call asking
what the object of the game is.</i>

402
00:29:56.736 --> 00:29:59.854
<i>Figuring that out is the object of the game.</i>

403
00:29:59.989 --> 00:30:01.855
<i>Good luck, and congratulations...</i>

404
00:30:01.991 --> 00:30:04.858
<i>on choosing CRS.</i>

405
00:30:04.994 --> 00:30:08.862
<i>Threatened to have the American
ambassador expelled after the incident.</i>

406
00:30:08.998 --> 00:30:12.161
<i>The US State Department responded
quickly with a formal apology...</i>

407
00:30:12.293 --> 00:30:15.752
<i>and announced the ambassador's
immediate and voluntary removal.</i>

408
00:30:34.357 --> 00:30:37.440
Can you spare a little change?
Help me out here, huh?

409
00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:39.601
 

410
00:30:53.626 --> 00:30:56.986
<i>If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.</i>

411
00:32:12.705 --> 00:32:14.537
May I help you?

412
00:32:18.753 --> 00:32:20.369
What is it?

413
00:32:23.758 --> 00:32:25.294
What?

414
00:32:34.435 --> 00:32:35.971
Thank you.

415
00:32:49.574 --> 00:32:51.236
Bud.

416
00:32:52.912 --> 00:32:54.903
Can you help me out?

417
00:32:56.457 --> 00:32:59.825
I need some toilet paper. I ran out.

418
00:33:02.254 --> 00:33:04.586
Just go into the next stall.

419
00:33:06.342 --> 00:33:09.050
Come on. Help me out.

420
00:33:09.178 --> 00:33:10.964
Hello?

421
00:33:12.097 --> 00:33:13.679
Hello?

422
00:33:18.479 --> 00:33:21.688
- Didn't expect to see you here.
- I wanted to wish you luck.

423
00:33:21.816 --> 00:33:25.184
- You've been up all night.
- I checked it personally.

424
00:33:25.319 --> 00:33:27.731
I appreciate that, Sam.
Why don't you go home and get some sleep?

425
00:33:27.863 --> 00:33:29.979
- You're sure you don't want me along?
- No, I'll be fine.

426
00:33:30.115 --> 00:33:32.857
Mm-hmm. Nice shirt.

427
00:33:32.993 --> 00:33:34.449
Don't ask, huh?

428
00:33:34.578 --> 00:33:36.068
Ciao.

429
00:34:00.312 --> 00:34:03.054
All these years...

430
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:06.353
the first time ever
you step foot in these offices...

431
00:34:06.485 --> 00:34:08.351
it's to ask me to step down.

432
00:34:08.487 --> 00:34:10.478
You promised to meet the projections, Anson.

433
00:34:10.656 --> 00:34:12.988
$1.60 a share is what you said.

434
00:34:13.158 --> 00:34:16.321
I don't think this visit comes as a surprise.

435
00:34:16.495 --> 00:34:19.738
- Projections were far too optimistic.
- Admittedly, yes.

436
00:34:19.874 --> 00:34:22.354
Our EPS was $1.50 last quarter.
We're up eight cents per share.

437
00:34:22.418 --> 00:34:26.707
The expectations were ten, and in this case
the expectations meant everything.

438
00:34:26.839 --> 00:34:29.422
Will you really hold me to it over pennies?

439
00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:32.008
My stock is falling. I don't know about yours.

440
00:34:32.136 --> 00:34:34.878
- Those pennies are costing millions.
- Give me...

441
00:34:35.014 --> 00:34:36.880
Give me next quarter.

442
00:34:37.016 --> 00:34:38.848
If you still feel this way, vote your shares.

443
00:34:38.976 --> 00:34:41.434
Today is what counts, Anson.

444
00:34:41.562 --> 00:34:43.803
No.

445
00:34:43.939 --> 00:34:45.771
You...

446
00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:48.232
You intractable son of a bitch.

447
00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.897
If your father could see you now.

448
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:53.522
- What?
- Your father was a friend.

449
00:34:53.657 --> 00:34:56.115
A friend, goddamn it. I've watched you grow up.

450
00:34:56.243 --> 00:34:59.326
Because you went fishing with my father,
I should sit on my hands

451
00:34:59.455 --> 00:35:01.321
while you're throwing my money away?

452
00:35:01.457 --> 00:35:03.073
- I--
- I'm not finished.

453
00:35:03.208 --> 00:35:07.748
Now, you misspoke before
when you said you're stepping down.

454
00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.121
I am firing you.

455
00:35:10.257 --> 00:35:13.545
Action is taken, confidence is restored.

456
00:35:13.677 --> 00:35:15.668
And the stock goes up.

457
00:35:15.804 --> 00:35:19.547
There's no Baer-Grant Publishing,

458
00:35:19.725 --> 00:35:22.012
no Baer-Grant Publishing,

459
00:35:22.144 --> 00:35:24.761
without Anson Baer.

460
00:35:24.897 --> 00:35:26.777
Where's Stuart Grant? He's probably out there

461
00:35:26.899 --> 00:35:29.015
sailing, enjoying his golden years

462
00:35:29.151 --> 00:35:31.062
wondering where the hell you are, Anson.

463
00:35:32.279 --> 00:35:34.020
I'm sorry.

464
00:35:34.156 --> 00:35:36.022
You failed.

465
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:41.952
I have prepared a severance package

466
00:35:42.081 --> 00:35:45.699
that is more than equitable.

467
00:35:45.834 --> 00:35:49.998
Valid until this evening.

468
00:35:51.173 --> 00:35:53.289
I could fight you at this.

469
00:35:53.425 --> 00:35:56.588
If I leave without your signature

470
00:35:56.762 --> 00:35:58.878
this agreement begins to disintegrate.

471
00:35:59.014 --> 00:36:02.803
Benefits shrink, options narrow,

472
00:36:02.935 --> 00:36:05.017
and your compensation will be shriveled.

473
00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:15.228
I think it's in your best interest, Anson...

474
00:36:15.364 --> 00:36:16.946
 

475
00:36:31.505 --> 00:36:35.123
Well, I guess this is your... lucky day.

476
00:36:36.218 --> 00:36:39.131
My lawyers will be in touch with you.

477
00:37:12.254 --> 00:37:15.212
Excuse me. Has Conrad Van Orton left a message?

478
00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.206
I'll check on it right away, Mr. Van Orton.

479
00:37:17.342 --> 00:37:19.083
Thank you.

480
00:37:23.766 --> 00:37:26.679
Ah! Oh, I'm so sorry.

481
00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:29.472
- Here. Here.
- Please, don't do that.

482
00:37:29.605 --> 00:37:31.221
I'm so sorry. I wasn't even looking.

483
00:37:31.356 --> 00:37:34.474
- I'm really having a bad clay.
- How about a bad month?

484
00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:37.477
You did almost exactly the same thing
to me when I was here last week.

485
00:37:37.613 --> 00:37:40.856
- Here.
- Don't do that. Just get me some napkins

486
00:37:41.033 --> 00:37:43.570
and some soda water.

487
00:37:43.702 --> 00:37:47.866
It looks like the, uh, cleaning bill's
gonna be more than the suit.

488
00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:50.031
I don't think so.

489
00:37:50.167 --> 00:37:53.376
- It was an accident, sir.
- Terrific.

490
00:37:53.504 --> 00:37:55.461
I said I was sorry.

491
00:37:58.300 --> 00:37:59.961
Asshole.

492
00:38:00.094 --> 00:38:02.552
Christine, Mr. Van Orton is a valued customer.

493
00:38:02.721 --> 00:38:05.839
- Fine. Then you kiss his ass.
- Don't you talk to me like that.

494
00:38:05.974 --> 00:38:08.966
I apologized. I offered to help.
What do you want me to do?

495
00:38:09.103 --> 00:38:10.969
- Clean out your locker.
- What?

496
00:38:11.105 --> 00:38:13.062
You heard me.

497
00:38:15.859 --> 00:38:17.520
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Van Orton.

498
00:38:17.653 --> 00:38:21.237
If you're not too uncomfortable, will this
table suit you for a complimentary meal?

499
00:38:21.365 --> 00:38:22.981
It will be fine.

500
00:38:31.083 --> 00:38:33.450
- I'll fetch your waiter.
- Thank you.

501
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:36.581
Check, sir.

502
00:38:58.068 --> 00:39:00.776
Fuck you and your vichyssoise, you little--

503
00:39:00.904 --> 00:39:03.362
Miss? Pardon me, miss.

504
00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:06.448
- Oh, great. It's you.
- I don't know how this works,

505
00:39:06.577 --> 00:39:08.909
but do you have something for me?

506
00:39:09.037 --> 00:39:11.449
I, uh...

507
00:39:11.582 --> 00:39:15.200
- I received this, uh, this note.
- What are you babbling about, psycho?

508
00:39:15.335 --> 00:39:18.578
- I need to know what is going on.
- You want to know what's going on?

509
00:39:18.714 --> 00:39:22.582
I'm going on my second job this month.
Now it looks like I'm going on unemployment.

510
00:39:22.718 --> 00:39:26.131
- Maybe I should try to explain. I--
- Don't explain.

511
00:39:26.263 --> 00:39:28.129
Just fuck off.

512
00:39:29.391 --> 00:39:32.804
Son of a bitch!

513
00:39:32.936 --> 00:39:36.270
I am, I'm trying to, I am apologizing. I--

514
00:39:49.161 --> 00:39:51.994
Jesus, what is this?

515
00:39:54.499 --> 00:39:57.287
- What's with him?
- I don't know. He just, he fell down.

516
00:39:57.419 --> 00:40:00.002
Sir, can you hear me?
Do you know what to do?

517
00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:03.168
I don't even know if he's breathing. He's...

518
00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:06.668
Move your head. Don't stand there. Get help.

519
00:40:07.804 --> 00:40:10.045
Hey. Hey. It's okay.

520
00:40:10.182 --> 00:40:13.641
- We're gonna get help.
- How do we know he's real?

521
00:40:13.769 --> 00:40:16.431
He's pissing his pants, mister.
Is that real enough for you?

522
00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:21.023
- Oh, my God.
- He's turning blue.

523
00:40:22.361 --> 00:40:24.398
Police! Police!

524
00:40:34.831 --> 00:40:38.244
- You have to fill these forms out.
- I don't know this man.

525
00:40:38.377 --> 00:40:40.414
- Here. What do you need?
- I can't get involved in this.

526
00:40:40.545 --> 00:40:42.707
- I'm gonna have to detain you.
- Detain me?

527
00:40:42.839 --> 00:40:45.627
- The report's got to be filled out.
- She can do the report.

528
00:40:45.759 --> 00:40:48.296
- Ride with your wife,
and we'll meet at the hospital.
- The hospital?

529
00:40:48.428 --> 00:40:50.590
- Two blocks away.
- She's not my wife.

530
00:40:52.224 --> 00:40:54.181
Let's go.

531
00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:58.557
This is insane.

532
00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:01.392
Ten minutes ago, I was about
to enjoy a quiet little dinner.

533
00:41:01.566 --> 00:41:03.728
I received this note.

534
00:41:07.281 --> 00:41:09.613
- He's breathing, isn't he?
- Yes.

535
00:41:09.741 --> 00:41:12.073
Is the siren entirely necessary?

536
00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.736
Thanks.

537
00:41:25.299 --> 00:41:29.293
Let's just talk to someone who
can get this over with, shall we?

538
00:41:29.428 --> 00:41:31.590
Hang on.

539
00:41:31.722 --> 00:41:34.840
They need your driver's license number.

540
00:41:47.612 --> 00:41:50.946
Oh, no. You've got to be kidding.

541
00:41:51.116 --> 00:41:52.948
What is happening here?

542
00:41:53.118 --> 00:41:56.406
This is what I was trying to
explain to you. This is a, uh, a game.

543
00:41:58.081 --> 00:42:00.948
- A what?
- It's a company. They plan elaborate pranks.

544
00:42:01.084 --> 00:42:04.452
Things like this.
I don't really understand it myself.

545
00:42:04.588 --> 00:42:07.956
What are you talking about? This is a...

546
00:42:08.133 --> 00:42:11.467
The lights, they went out,
a hundred people ran away.

547
00:42:12.512 --> 00:42:14.378
What, so you mean the guy who just

548
00:42:14.514 --> 00:42:16.505
pissed himself and turned blue was...

549
00:42:16.641 --> 00:42:19.133
Sorry about that.

550
00:42:19.311 --> 00:42:21.222
You should be.

551
00:42:25.025 --> 00:42:27.733
Why are they involving you?

552
00:42:27.861 --> 00:42:30.603
There's got to be a...

553
00:42:30.739 --> 00:42:33.572
thingy, a flashlight.

554
00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:35.657
Oh, great.

555
00:42:40.415 --> 00:42:43.328
I thought that guy was gonna die.
I gave him mouth-to-mouth.

556
00:42:43.502 --> 00:42:45.334
I'll see ya around.

557
00:42:48.507 --> 00:42:52.171
- How do you know that's the way?
- I don't.

558
00:43:02.896 --> 00:43:06.014
Where'd you all go,
you motherfuckin' frat boys?

559
00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:10.943
You'd better hide.

560
00:43:30.799 --> 00:43:32.756
- Lobby?
- Right.

561
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:20.179
My brother got me this
gift certificate to this company.

562
00:44:21.308 --> 00:44:24.096
I-I got the key out of this...

563
00:44:24.269 --> 00:44:28.058
out of the mouth of this... wooden clown.

564
00:44:29.316 --> 00:44:31.307
Never mind.

565
00:44:34.488 --> 00:44:37.901
I don't like this.

566
00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:47.952
- There's no signal.
- What is the going rate...

567
00:44:48.126 --> 00:44:50.413
for a "trapped in the elevator" adventure?

568
00:44:52.464 --> 00:44:54.455
Oh, don't even think about it.

569
00:44:54.591 --> 00:44:57.128
- Why not?
- "Warning."

570
00:44:57.302 --> 00:44:59.168
"Do not attempt to open. If elevator stops,"

571
00:44:59.304 --> 00:45:02.797
- "use emergency"..."
- Phone. If there was one.

572
00:45:02.933 --> 00:45:05.174
And "wait for help" so...

573
00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:07.893
let's just wait for help.

574
00:45:17.531 --> 00:45:20.899
- Okay, I'll give you a boost.
- You can, you can go first.

575
00:45:21.034 --> 00:45:22.900
This is not an attempt to be gallant.

576
00:45:23.036 --> 00:45:25.073
If I don't lift you, how are you gonna get up?

577
00:45:25.205 --> 00:45:27.116
Well, you'll pull me up.

578
00:45:27.249 --> 00:45:29.331
It's easier my way. Come on, step up.

579
00:45:29.501 --> 00:45:31.538
- No.
- Oh, please.

580
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:34.662
I'm not wearing any underwear.

581
00:45:34.839 --> 00:45:36.830
Okay. There, I said it.

582
00:45:41.596 --> 00:45:43.178
Okay.

583
00:45:59.614 --> 00:46:02.527
- We can use this like a ladder.
- My hero. Let's go.

584
00:46:05.996 --> 00:46:07.862
I don't think so.

585
00:46:10.125 --> 00:46:11.866
Thank you.

586
00:46:20.176 --> 00:46:22.167
Damn it! My briefcase!

587
00:46:25.849 --> 00:46:27.715
I'll wait.

588
00:46:27.851 --> 00:46:30.058
Not as if anybody could open it.

589
00:46:38.111 --> 00:46:40.398
Wait a minute. This is CRS.

590
00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:43.147
- What's CRS?
- This is the company I was telling you about.

591
00:46:43.283 --> 00:46:45.820
The one that gave me the gift certificate.

592
00:46:45.952 --> 00:46:48.284
This is their building.

593
00:46:54.919 --> 00:46:57.832
We'll wait, we'll wait for security to come,

594
00:46:57.964 --> 00:46:59.796
and we'll just explain.

595
00:46:59.924 --> 00:47:01.835
They'll love that. Explain for both of us.

596
00:47:01.968 --> 00:47:04.505
Wait-Wait! Wait!

597
00:47:04.638 --> 00:47:06.549
W-Wait a minute.

598
00:47:21.905 --> 00:47:23.942
We don't want to draw any attention.

599
00:47:24.074 --> 00:47:26.031
- Just out for a stroll.
- Run.

600
00:47:31.456 --> 00:47:33.618
We can't fit down there!

601
00:47:39.673 --> 00:47:42.665
- Are you trying to ditch me?
- Hey, you're a grown man!

602
00:47:42.801 --> 00:47:45.241
- I'm not responsible--
- I'm not the one who started running.

603
00:47:46.638 --> 00:47:48.800
Well, I'm not the one that started this...

604
00:48:05.073 --> 00:48:06.905
- Get up there!
- I'm going!

605
00:48:09.494 --> 00:48:11.826
Here. Climb.

606
00:48:11.955 --> 00:48:14.663
Climb.

607
00:48:22.757 --> 00:48:26.045
So where's your modesty around attack dogs?

608
00:48:26.177 --> 00:48:27.633
Shit!

609
00:48:37.856 --> 00:48:39.642
Hey! Shut up, you stupid fuckin' dogs!

610
00:48:44.112 --> 00:48:46.979
I go first.

611
00:48:57.917 --> 00:49:00.705
There goes a thousand dollars.

612
00:49:00.837 --> 00:49:04.671
- Your shoes cost a thousand dollars?
- That one did.

613
00:49:10.555 --> 00:49:12.842
Here. Come on.

614
00:49:12.974 --> 00:49:14.681
There you go.

615
00:49:15.935 --> 00:49:19.269
Watch out for nails and rats.

616
00:49:19.397 --> 00:49:20.887
What?

617
00:49:21.024 --> 00:49:23.812
There should be a fire escape.

618
00:49:43.713 --> 00:49:45.829
Ah, it's classic.

619
00:49:47.008 --> 00:49:49.090
Why me?

620
00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:54.091
Who are you?

621
00:49:55.183 --> 00:49:56.799
Nicholas Van Orton.

622
00:49:56.935 --> 00:49:59.768
What are you, a czar or something?

623
00:50:01.022 --> 00:50:02.763
All right.

624
00:50:02.899 --> 00:50:04.640
I think...

625
00:50:04.776 --> 00:50:07.063
if we drop from here...

626
00:50:07.195 --> 00:50:09.687
the garbage will break our fall.

627
00:50:09.823 --> 00:50:12.440
I think not. Be careful!

628
00:50:18.373 --> 00:50:20.831
What the fuck are you looking at?

629
00:50:20.959 --> 00:50:22.950
On. Holy shit.

630
00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:51.277
Table for two, please.

631
00:50:57.245 --> 00:51:00.237
- Where are we going?
- That tall, bright building.

632
00:51:00.373 --> 00:51:02.330
It's right near here.

633
00:51:07.463 --> 00:51:09.830
Everything okay, miss?

634
00:51:10.008 --> 00:51:12.841
Yeah. How are you doing?

635
00:51:14.012 --> 00:51:16.470
San Francisco's finest.

636
00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:29.312
Is there someplace I could throw this?

637
00:51:31.362 --> 00:51:35.651
- There's a wastebasket beside the desk.
- Oh.

638
00:51:35.783 --> 00:51:38.400
I think I have a fresh
sweatshirt for you somewhere.

639
00:51:39.871 --> 00:51:41.532
That'd be great.

640
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:49.203
You know, you've never even asked me my name.

641
00:51:49.339 --> 00:51:52.047
The maitre d' said your name was Christine.

642
00:51:52.175 --> 00:51:54.507
Ah, right.

643
00:51:55.553 --> 00:51:57.920
I guess I'll call you a cab.

644
00:52:01.768 --> 00:52:03.725
You got a shower in your office?

645
00:52:03.895 --> 00:52:06.728
- Yep.
- You an athlete or something?

646
00:52:06.856 --> 00:52:10.065
No, I'm an investment banker.

647
00:52:10.193 --> 00:52:13.982
I move money from one place to another.

648
00:52:18.326 --> 00:52:20.863
Actually, would you mind
if I just quickly rinsed off?

649
00:52:20.995 --> 00:52:23.236
No.

650
00:52:24.916 --> 00:52:27.248
Is there a towel I could use?

651
00:52:27.377 --> 00:52:29.994
Yeah, it's behind the door.

652
00:52:30.129 --> 00:52:33.087
- Oh. I'll just be a second.
- No problem.

653
00:52:35.718 --> 00:52:38.255
Listen, I, uh,
I know the owner of the City Club...

654
00:52:38.388 --> 00:52:41.255
and I'd be happy to
give him a call, if you'd like.

655
00:52:41.432 --> 00:52:44.094
Don't. It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.

656
00:52:45.645 --> 00:52:47.727
I, uh...

657
00:52:47.855 --> 00:52:49.687
I have a confession to make.

658
00:52:51.526 --> 00:52:53.767
Someone gave me four hundred bucks

659
00:52:53.945 --> 00:52:56.778
to spill drinks on you as a practical joke.

660
00:52:56.906 --> 00:52:59.113
Really? And what'd they say?

661
00:52:59.242 --> 00:53:02.826
Well, they said three hundred. I said four.
They said, "The guy in the gray flannel suit."

662
00:53:02.954 --> 00:53:05.571
I think I said, "The, uh..."

663
00:53:05.707 --> 00:53:08.039
"attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?"

664
00:53:33.192 --> 00:53:37.277
Mr. Van Orton, I was afraid
you weren't going to make it back.

665
00:53:37.405 --> 00:53:40.022
Thank you.

666
00:53:45.163 --> 00:53:47.200
- Hello?
- <i>Mr. Van Orton, it's Maria.</i>

667
00:53:47.331 --> 00:53:49.538
- <i>I thought I should call.</i>
- What time is it?

668
00:53:49.667 --> 00:53:52.204
<i>It's 11:00. I took the liberty...</i>

669
00:53:52.336 --> 00:53:54.497
<i>of rescheduling your meeting
with Allison and Dietrich.</i>

670
00:53:54.547 --> 00:53:56.879
No, no, no. I'll be in there in an hour.

671
00:53:57.008 --> 00:53:58.874
Uh, can you, um...

672
00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:01.502
I left my briefcase at 1019 Montgomery Street.

673
00:54:01.679 --> 00:54:03.761
Could you check with lost and found, please?

674
00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:06.348
- <i>Anson Baer is in town at the Ritz-Carlton.</i>
- Really?

675
00:54:06.517 --> 00:54:09.350
- <i>He's requesting dinner tonight.</i>
- Well, we'll see about that.

676
00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:11.431
<i>And the Hotel Nikko called to say</i>

677
00:54:11.564 --> 00:54:14.397
<i>they have your American Express
card at the front desk.</i>

678
00:54:14.525 --> 00:54:17.859
<i>You left it there last night.</i>

679
00:54:18.029 --> 00:54:19.986
- <i>Should I send someone--</i>
- No, just give me the number.

680
00:54:20.114 --> 00:54:22.697
- <i>555-1111.</i>
- I'll call you back.

681
00:54:27.288 --> 00:54:30.049
- <i>Good morning. Hotel Nikko.</i>
- Yes, this is Nicholas Van Orton.

682
00:54:30.166 --> 00:54:32.032
<i>I'm told you have my American Express card.</i>

683
00:54:32.168 --> 00:54:34.159
<i>Yes, Mr. Van Orton. Everything's in order.</i>

684
00:54:34.295 --> 00:54:36.815
<i>The concierge has arranged for
the wine and flowers in the room.</i>

685
00:54:36.839 --> 00:54:38.876
- Has he?
- <i>And a young woman phoned</i>

686
00:54:39.050 --> 00:54:41.758
<i>to say she's en route
but running a little late.</i>

687
00:54:41.886 --> 00:54:45.299
<i>Did the young woman leave her name?</i>

688
00:54:45.431 --> 00:54:47.513
<i>I'm sure I don't know.</i>

689
00:54:47.642 --> 00:54:50.555
Of course you don't. Thank you.

690
00:55:00.571 --> 00:55:02.403
Sorry. My fault.

691
00:55:09.247 --> 00:55:11.033
Ah, Mr. Van Orton.

692
00:55:11.165 --> 00:55:12.781
Welcome back.

693
00:55:12.917 --> 00:55:14.658
Here we go.

694
00:55:15.962 --> 00:55:17.544
Have we met?

695
00:55:17.672 --> 00:55:20.505
I believe so.

696
00:55:24.011 --> 00:55:26.969
If you'll just sign here on the signature card.

697
00:55:34.105 --> 00:55:35.846
Thank you.

698
00:55:40.486 --> 00:55:43.899
- My key?
- Hmm?

699
00:55:44.031 --> 00:55:46.693
Don't I get a key?

700
00:55:46.826 --> 00:55:49.568
Didn't I give you one last night?

701
00:55:49.704 --> 00:55:51.615
No, I don't think so.

702
00:55:55.168 --> 00:55:57.455
Cute. That's very cute.

703
00:55:57.587 --> 00:55:59.294
This way, sir.

704
00:55:59.422 --> 00:56:01.333
Have a nice day.

705
00:57:42.482 --> 00:57:44.224
<i>Housekeeping.</i>

706
00:57:51.409 --> 00:57:53.821
Could you, uh, come back a little later?

707
00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:21.431
Aah! Shit!

708
00:58:55.681 --> 00:58:57.797
Thank you, sir.

709
01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:12.372
Where the fuck is he?

710
01:00:12.508 --> 01:00:15.671
- Why are you following me?
- What are you talking about?

711
01:00:15.803 --> 01:00:17.635
I'm not following you. I'm just driving...

712
01:00:17.763 --> 01:00:22.303
- Hey, whatever I'm doing is none of your business.
- Is Anson Baer the game?

713
01:00:22.435 --> 01:00:24.346
- Is that what this is all about?
- Look, buddy.

714
01:00:24.478 --> 01:00:26.515
Back off. Just back off, huh?

715
01:00:26.647 --> 01:00:29.639
- What--
- Oh, that's cute.

716
01:00:29.775 --> 01:00:31.265
That's really cute.

717
01:00:31.402 --> 01:00:33.734
I suppose the game uses real bullets, huh?

718
01:00:35.197 --> 01:00:37.029
Jesus Christ!

719
01:00:38.492 --> 01:00:41.530
All right. I'm a private investigator.

720
01:00:41.662 --> 01:00:45.496
- Somebody hired me to keep tabs on you.
- Who? Who hired you? Who hired you?

721
01:00:54.341 --> 01:00:56.048
<i>Mr. Van Orton?</i>

722
01:00:56.177 --> 01:00:58.043
Maria, get hold of Sutherland.

723
01:00:58.179 --> 01:01:00.921
Have him meet me at the
Ritz-Carlton. I'm on my way.

724
01:01:12.067 --> 01:01:14.684
- What's happened?
- Follow me, Sam.

725
01:01:22.786 --> 01:01:24.948
Ah, Nicholas. This is unexpected.

726
01:01:29.627 --> 01:01:32.415
Now, do you really believe

727
01:01:32.546 --> 01:01:34.662
that just because you publish children's books

728
01:01:34.798 --> 01:01:37.256
people are gonna care about my reputation?

729
01:01:37.384 --> 01:01:39.876
You can have pictures of me wearing nipple rings

730
01:01:40.012 --> 01:01:41.969
butt-fucking Captain Kangaroo.

731
01:01:42.097 --> 01:01:44.259
The only thing they care about is the stock

732
01:01:44.391 --> 01:01:46.598
and whether that stock is up or down!

733
01:01:46.727 --> 01:01:48.263
- Daddy?
- It's all right.

734
01:01:48.395 --> 01:01:50.477
And the fact that you bring Conrad...

735
01:01:50.648 --> 01:01:52.980
into this juvenile game...

736
01:01:53.108 --> 01:01:54.815
is unconscionable.

737
01:01:56.070 --> 01:01:58.687
- Are you finished?
- No, I'm not finished!

738
01:01:59.782 --> 01:02:01.822
I'd like you to meet
my attorney, Samuel Sutherland.

739
01:02:01.951 --> 01:02:04.409
I think the two of you
have got something to talk about.

740
01:02:04.537 --> 01:02:06.494
Oh, we met this morning.

741
01:02:06.664 --> 01:02:09.497
I signed the termination
contract for Baer-Grant.

742
01:02:09.625 --> 01:02:12.333
I accepted your settlement, Nicholas.

743
01:02:13.754 --> 01:02:16.997
You were right. I'm going sailing.
You know, sailing.

744
01:02:18.676 --> 01:02:23.295
You are welcome to join our lunch,
and maybe we can straighten this out.

745
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:27.674
You remember my wife, Mary Carol,
and my daughter-in-law, Kaleigh.

746
01:02:34.942 --> 01:02:36.853
Please, uh...

747
01:02:38.112 --> 01:02:39.978
accept my...

748
01:02:41.115 --> 01:02:42.981
misguided, uh...

749
01:02:55.212 --> 01:02:57.328
How concerned should I be?

750
01:02:57.464 --> 01:02:59.205
It was a misunderstanding.

751
01:03:00.593 --> 01:03:02.459
It looks a lot like you.

752
01:03:02.595 --> 01:03:06.384
Well, you should see what
they do with the nightly news.

753
01:03:06.515 --> 01:03:09.507
- What?
- Can I ask you to do me a favor?

754
01:03:09.643 --> 01:03:12.476
- You know you can.
- Find out about a company...

755
01:03:12.605 --> 01:03:16.439
called Consumer Recreation Services.

756
01:03:16.567 --> 01:03:18.808
Sounds like they make tennis racquets.

757
01:03:18.944 --> 01:03:21.627
- What do you know?
- Uh...

758
01:03:21.655 --> 01:03:23.896
Wait a minute. They gave me a waiver.

759
01:03:39.381 --> 01:03:41.247
- What is this?
- It's a wai...

760
01:03:43.719 --> 01:03:45.084
It's...

761
01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:48.967
I don't believe it. It's invisible ink.

762
01:03:49.099 --> 01:03:51.636
- You're joking.
- This is what I'm dealing with.

763
01:03:51.769 --> 01:03:55.728
I'm being toyed with by a
bunch of depraved children. This...

764
01:03:57.608 --> 01:03:59.269
Are you okay?

765
01:03:59.401 --> 01:04:02.439
Tell me not to worry.

766
01:04:03.947 --> 01:04:06.154
You don't have to worry.

767
01:04:06.283 --> 01:04:08.775
- I promise.
- Okay.

768
01:04:10.595 --> 01:04:12.783
I'll call you later.

769
01:04:14.083 --> 01:04:15.915
Right. Okay. Bye.

770
01:04:18.754 --> 01:04:21.837
Maria, the other night, last night...

771
01:04:21.965 --> 01:04:24.332
I got a taxi for a young woman named Christine.

772
01:04:24.468 --> 01:04:26.588
- What' s the company that we use?
- <i>United.</i>

773
01:04:26.637 --> 01:04:28.924
- What?
- <i>United Taxi Company.</i>

774
01:04:29.056 --> 01:04:32.799
United Taxi Company. Call United,
find out who the driver was...

775
01:04:32.935 --> 01:04:34.846
and where they took her.

776
01:05:03.507 --> 01:05:06.169
Ilsa?

777
01:05:06.343 --> 01:05:08.129
Aah! Shit!

778
01:05:39.001 --> 01:05:40.912
I have a gun!

779
01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:09.232
 

780
01:06:09.406 --> 01:06:13.695
 

781
01:06:13.827 --> 01:06:18.242
 

782
01:06:18.415 --> 01:06:22.750
 

783
01:06:22.878 --> 01:06:26.746
 

784
01:06:26.924 --> 01:06:30.337
 

785
01:06:32.095 --> 01:06:34.086
 

786
01:06:34.223 --> 01:06:36.635
 

787
01:06:36.767 --> 01:06:40.726
 

788
01:06:40.854 --> 01:06:44.563
 

789
01:06:44.691 --> 01:06:49.936
 

790
01:06:50.113 --> 01:06:53.026
 

791
01:06:55.158 --> 01:06:56.776
You fuckers!

792
01:06:58.705 --> 01:07:01.538
 

793
01:07:01.667 --> 01:07:03.533
Ilsa!

794
01:07:03.669 --> 01:07:05.501
- Ilsa! Ilsa!
- Mr. Van Orton!

795
01:07:05.629 --> 01:07:07.620
- Are you all right?
- What do you mean? What's happened?

796
01:07:07.756 --> 01:07:09.957
- The house! You haven't seen the house?
- What's wrong?

797
01:07:09.967 --> 01:07:12.755
There's been a break-in. Lock your door.
Stay inside. Just lock your door.

798
01:07:12.886 --> 01:07:14.752
Oh, be careful!

799
01:07:20.269 --> 01:07:22.681
- <i>911 emergency.</i>
- Yes, I need the police.

800
01:07:22.813 --> 01:07:24.804
There's been a break-in to my house.

801
01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:27.056
<i>Okay, sir. Stay on the line
and give me your address.</i>

802
01:07:27.192 --> 01:07:29.308
My address is 2210 Broadway.

803
01:07:29.444 --> 01:07:32.812
- It's the biggest house on the street.
- <i>Sir, you said it was a break-in?</i>

804
01:07:32.948 --> 01:07:36.782
- Yes. Yes, there's been a break-in.
- <i>Are you sure they're gone?</i>

805
01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:38.400
What?

806
01:07:38.537 --> 01:07:41.325
<i>Are you sure there's not still
someone somewhere in the house?</i>

807
01:07:41.456 --> 01:07:44.494
- Aah!
- Nicky! Shh!

808
01:07:44.626 --> 01:07:47.118
- <i>Hello, sir? You still there?</i>
- Meet me at your car.

809
01:07:47.254 --> 01:07:50.792
<i>Hello? Sir?</i>

810
01:07:58.765 --> 01:08:00.676
- All right, what happened?
- Shh!

811
01:08:02.102 --> 01:08:05.060
- Conrad, where are we go--
- Shh, shh, shh. Just wait.

812
01:08:09.610 --> 01:08:11.442
What are you doing? What--

813
01:08:11.570 --> 01:08:15.689
They're methodical. If I can't trust the
room service in the hotel, I sure as hell
can't trust the fucking car.

814
01:08:15.824 --> 01:08:18.236
- Who?
- CRS! Who do you think?

815
01:08:18.368 --> 01:08:20.359
Jesus! When I think what I almost got you into.

816
01:08:20.537 --> 01:08:23.074
- What are you saying?
- Oh, I'm so fucked!

817
01:08:23.206 --> 01:08:26.574
They just fuck you and they
fuck you and they fuck you!

818
01:08:26.710 --> 01:08:29.670
And just when you think it's all over,
that's when the real fucking starts!

819
01:08:29.713 --> 01:08:31.704
All right, calm down. Just take a breath.

820
01:08:35.552 --> 01:08:38.010
They won't stop, Nick.

821
01:08:38.138 --> 01:08:40.425
I paid the bill.
I gave them their fuckin' money.

822
01:08:40.557 --> 01:08:43.675
- They won't leave me alone!
- What are they doing to you?

823
01:08:43.810 --> 01:08:45.721
Everything. I'm a goddamn human piñata!

824
01:08:45.896 --> 01:08:48.354
Calm down! Why do they
keep playing if you already paid?

825
01:08:48.482 --> 01:08:50.439
I don't know. I don't know.

826
01:08:50.567 --> 01:08:53.229
I paid 'em more to make it stop!

827
01:09:04.665 --> 01:09:07.248
- They did this.
- It's a flat tire.

828
01:09:07.417 --> 01:09:09.704
- How do you know?
- Get a grip on yourself, will you?

829
01:09:09.836 --> 01:09:12.123
- We'll figure it out!
- Okay. Okay.

830
01:09:22.724 --> 01:09:25.557
- The phone doesn't work. I can't get a signal.
- Really?

831
01:09:26.728 --> 01:09:29.060
- You know how to change a tire?
- No. Don't you?

832
01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:32.189
It can't be that hard. I don't think
we should be out in the open like this.

833
01:09:32.192 --> 01:09:35.230
Hit the Teletrac. It's in the glove compartment.

834
01:09:55.257 --> 01:09:57.419
You're with them.

835
01:09:57.551 --> 01:09:59.087
What?

836
01:09:59.219 --> 01:10:01.210
You're doing this. You're part of it.

837
01:10:01.346 --> 01:10:02.802
What?

838
01:10:04.474 --> 01:10:06.306
Whose are these?

839
01:10:07.561 --> 01:10:09.802
I don't know about those.
Somebody put them in the car.

840
01:10:09.938 --> 01:10:11.428
You're behind the whole thing, aren't you?

841
01:10:11.565 --> 01:10:13.897
What are you talking about?
You brought them to me!

842
01:10:14.026 --> 01:10:16.859
No, these were in your car.
They were right there

843
01:10:16.987 --> 01:10:19.649
- in your fucking car!
- Conrad!

844
01:10:25.287 --> 01:10:28.746
- Listen to what you're saying!
- No! You're not gonna control this conversation!

845
01:10:28.874 --> 01:10:30.956
Why would I ever do what you're describing?

846
01:10:31.084 --> 01:10:33.416
- Because you resent me!
- Stop being emotional.

847
01:10:33.545 --> 01:10:36.788
- It kills you that I'm living my life.
- Lower your voice, Conrad!

848
01:10:36.923 --> 01:10:40.166
What? You're afraid somebody's
gonna witness a scene?

849
01:10:40.302 --> 01:10:41.838
- Get back in your fucking house!
- Will you stop it?

850
01:10:41.970 --> 01:10:43.301
I'm calling the cops.

851
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:45.390
You're just so afraid somebody's gonna see what

852
01:10:45.407 --> 01:10:48.370
- a manipulative fucking control freak you are!
- What is wrong with you? What are you on?

853
01:10:48.602 --> 01:10:50.639
Oh, I'm sorry, Nick.

854
01:10:50.771 --> 01:10:52.887
I'm sorry I didn't live up to expectations.

855
01:10:53.023 --> 01:10:55.264
- Ah, bullshit!
- I'm not you. I'll never be you.

856
01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.516
- I don't want to be you.
- There you go again.

857
01:10:57.652 --> 01:11:00.252
- I'm your brother!
- Always pushing the responsibility out on me.

858
01:11:00.363 --> 01:11:03.822
- For chrissake, I'm your brother!
- All I ever tried to do was help you.

859
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:07.238
I don't want your help!
Nobody asked you to play Dad!

860
01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:10.283
No! You don't say that! Did I have a choice?

861
01:11:10.415 --> 01:11:12.406
Did I have a choice?

862
01:11:16.046 --> 01:11:19.630
Get out of the road, jackass!

863
01:11:31.978 --> 01:11:33.719
Conrad!

864
01:12:04.511 --> 01:12:06.502
What?

865
01:12:06.638 --> 01:12:09.221
<i>- All I ever tried to do was help you!
- I don't want your help!</i>

866
01:12:09.349 --> 01:12:12.887
<i>- Nobody asked you to play Dad!
- Did I have a choice? Did I have a choice?</i>

867
01:12:33.206 --> 01:12:34.867
Taxi!

868
01:12:39.838 --> 01:12:41.545
2210 Broadway.

869
01:13:07.824 --> 01:13:10.316
Hey, buddy, you missed the turn.

870
01:13:12.078 --> 01:13:14.160
Hey. Did you hear me?

871
01:13:14.289 --> 01:13:16.997
You missed the turn back--

872
01:13:18.501 --> 01:13:20.742
Oh, no, no. Stop the car!

873
01:13:20.879 --> 01:13:23.246
Stop the car!

874
01:13:27.761 --> 01:13:30.628
Thank you. Open the door.

875
01:13:30.764 --> 01:13:33.927
Unlock the door. Open the goddamn door!

876
01:13:42.734 --> 01:13:47.500
Listen, I am a very wealthy man

877
01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:47.700
 

878
01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:51.406
and whatever they're paying you, I'll double it.

879
01:14:11.145 --> 01:14:13.482
What? What?

880
01:14:18.311 --> 01:14:21.053
What? No!

881
01:14:42.335 --> 01:14:44.246
What are you, out of your fuckin' mind?

882
01:14:59.936 --> 01:15:02.769
It's a game.

883
01:15:02.897 --> 01:15:07.562
It's a game.

884
01:15:47.233 --> 01:15:49.019
Here they are.

885
01:15:53.156 --> 01:15:55.773
- Detective, I'm Sam Sutherland.
- Tim Foley.

886
01:15:57.369 --> 01:15:59.110
Do you know where we're going?

887
01:15:59.245 --> 01:16:01.486
It's this way. Fourteenth floor.

888
01:16:21.267 --> 01:16:23.429
Okay. Management for the building says the space

889
01:16:23.561 --> 01:16:25.347
hasn't been officially rented yet.

890
01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:27.596
The county recorder has no listing

891
01:16:27.732 --> 01:16:30.394
for a Consumer Recreation Service,

892
01:16:30.527 --> 01:16:32.234
or any derivation thereof.

893
01:16:32.362 --> 01:16:34.478
The divers, they're still looking for the cab.

894
01:16:34.614 --> 01:16:37.014
As soon as they find it,
they'll pull the plates and the VIN.

895
01:16:37.075 --> 01:16:38.986
Have you spoken to your brother?

896
01:16:39.119 --> 01:16:41.156
He hasn't called me back yet, no.

897
01:16:41.287 --> 01:16:43.198
What about the house?

898
01:16:43.331 --> 01:16:47.416
The graffiti was an oil-based marine
marking solution. Illegal in the States.

899
01:16:47.544 --> 01:16:50.252
It's not impossible to trace,
but it'll take time.

900
01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:52.417
The photo, the gun,

901
01:16:52.549 --> 01:16:54.916
the clown, the ambulance,

902
01:16:55.051 --> 01:16:57.509
it's all pending.

903
01:16:57.637 --> 01:16:59.719
Breaking and entering we got solid.

904
01:16:59.848 --> 01:17:03.216
Malicious mischief, vandalism,
harassment, but that's all.

905
01:17:03.393 --> 01:17:05.885
Illegal surveillance. Reckless endangerment.

906
01:17:06.062 --> 01:17:07.769
Attempted murder.

907
01:17:07.897 --> 01:17:11.185
Except you said you hired these guys.

908
01:17:11.317 --> 01:17:13.979
- That's irrelevant.
- Now, look.

909
01:17:14.112 --> 01:17:17.901
It's our job to tell you what we've got.
So far, we don't have motive.

910
01:17:27.250 --> 01:17:30.584
What was my father like, Ilsa?

911
01:17:30.712 --> 01:17:32.578
Why do you ask?

912
01:17:32.714 --> 01:17:35.126
I don't know.

913
01:17:35.258 --> 01:17:38.250
All the time I've known you,
you've never once asked about him.

914
01:17:41.222 --> 01:17:43.429
Well, I guess he was just on my mind.

915
01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.262
Your mother loved your father very much.

916
01:17:46.394 --> 01:17:49.136
I think he just worked too hard.

917
01:17:49.272 --> 01:17:50.762
Was he, uh...

918
01:17:52.192 --> 01:17:54.103
morose? I mean...

919
01:17:54.277 --> 01:17:56.063
What I remember most

920
01:17:56.196 --> 01:18:00.064
was that his manner was so... slight.

921
01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:03.613
You could spend time in a room

922
01:18:03.745 --> 01:18:05.611
and not even know that
he'd been there the whole time.

923
01:18:05.747 --> 01:18:08.580
No, what I mean is...

924
01:18:08.708 --> 01:18:11.791
- before he...
- What happened? No.

925
01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:14.082
Nobody expected it.

926
01:18:14.214 --> 01:18:17.172
I wonder how much of him there is in me.

927
01:18:18.384 --> 01:18:20.876
Not much, I think.

928
01:18:23.473 --> 01:18:26.010
Was Mother worried about him?

929
01:18:26.142 --> 01:18:29.305
Nobody ever worried about your father.

930
01:18:33.483 --> 01:18:36.692
- Yes?
- <i>It's Maria. I found the address
you wanted from United Taxi.</i>

931
01:18:36.819 --> 01:18:39.652
- Yeah, give it to me.
- <i>It's on Potrero Hill.</i>

932
01:19:40.842 --> 01:19:42.833
Who are you?

933
01:19:42.969 --> 01:19:46.178
Christine... is she here?

934
01:19:46.306 --> 01:19:50.049
- She's sleepin'.
- Amy, who is it?

935
01:19:51.561 --> 01:19:53.347
Hey. What are you doing here?

936
01:19:53.479 --> 01:19:55.937
Can we talk?

937
01:19:56.065 --> 01:19:57.931
Sure.

938
01:20:01.029 --> 01:20:02.940
- Hi.
- Hi.

939
01:20:06.409 --> 01:20:09.071
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.

940
01:20:09.203 --> 01:20:11.410
What can you tell me about these?

941
01:20:11.539 --> 01:20:14.122
Is this you?

942
01:20:14.250 --> 01:20:16.412
Where'd you get them?

943
01:20:16.544 --> 01:20:19.332
My hotel room. It was in my hotel room.

944
01:20:19.464 --> 01:20:21.580
Are you telling me that this is not you?

945
01:20:23.217 --> 01:20:25.834
What makes you, um...

946
01:20:25.970 --> 01:20:27.586
think this is me?

947
01:20:27.722 --> 01:20:31.761
Well... the bra. The red bra.

948
01:20:31.893 --> 01:20:33.600
Okay.

949
01:20:33.770 --> 01:20:35.932
Well, I thought that...

950
01:20:40.276 --> 01:20:42.313
Can I sit down for a minute?

951
01:20:42.445 --> 01:20:44.527
Sure.

952
01:20:44.656 --> 01:20:46.613
Are you all right?

953
01:20:48.201 --> 01:20:50.067
You're not all right, are you?

954
01:20:50.203 --> 01:20:52.740
Is it this contest thing

955
01:20:52.872 --> 01:20:55.204
that you're in still, or...

956
01:20:55.333 --> 01:20:57.916
I'm sorry. I'm being a nuisance. I should go.

957
01:20:58.044 --> 01:21:01.787
No, it's okay. We can talk.
I'll put some clothes on. I'll be right back.

958
01:21:08.054 --> 01:21:09.965
Do you have an aspirin or--

959
01:23:01.083 --> 01:23:03.575
- Can I get you something to drink with this?
- Is this you?

960
01:23:05.254 --> 01:23:07.586
Oh, yeah. That's, uh, First Communion.

961
01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:11.758
- Show it to me.
- What's wrong?

962
01:23:11.928 --> 01:23:16.297
Take the picture out of
the frame and show it to me.

963
01:23:16.432 --> 01:23:18.389
All right.

964
01:23:20.311 --> 01:23:22.018
They're watching.

965
01:23:22.146 --> 01:23:24.228
- What?
- Not here.

966
01:23:24.357 --> 01:23:26.064
They can see.

967
01:23:26.192 --> 01:23:29.275
The, uh... smoke detector.

968
01:23:33.658 --> 01:23:36.116
What do you say, uh...

969
01:23:36.285 --> 01:23:38.276
Let's go for a drive or something. We can...

970
01:23:38.412 --> 01:23:40.699
No, no, no. I am tired of this.

971
01:23:40.832 --> 01:23:44.245
- I am goddamn tired of this.
- We'll-we'll go for a drink. There's a--

972
01:23:44.377 --> 01:23:47.995
Who do you people think you are?
Who do you think you are?

973
01:23:48.130 --> 01:23:49.495
- Come on out of there!
- Nicholas, please.

974
01:23:49.632 --> 01:23:52.795
Let's go, right now!
Come out of there right now!

975
01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:03.051
Now you've done it.

976
01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:22.947
- Shit!
- So what are they going to do?

977
01:24:23.082 --> 01:24:25.323
Get away from the window.

978
01:25:04.874 --> 01:25:08.367
- What is this?
- Wake up. It's a fucking con!

979
01:25:49.835 --> 01:25:51.451
Get in! Get in!

980
01:26:12.858 --> 01:26:14.769
You all right? Hold on.

981
01:26:37.258 --> 01:26:39.625
- Get out of the car.
- I could've handed you to them.

982
01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:41.797
- They find me now and I'm dead.
- Get out of the goddamn car!

983
01:26:41.929 --> 01:26:43.419
You don't have a choice.

984
01:26:43.556 --> 01:26:45.467
No one else is gonna tell you what's going on!

985
01:27:02.366 --> 01:27:05.279
You want to know?
'Cause if I'm gone, you never will.

986
01:27:18.466 --> 01:27:21.925
I can't believe they didn't take
the time to get the fuckin' house right.

987
01:27:22.053 --> 01:27:24.841
- Who are "they"?
- I don't know. Nobody does. I'm an employee.

988
01:27:24.972 --> 01:27:27.054
- Then what good are you?
- I know things, like who you can trust...

989
01:27:27.183 --> 01:27:29.049
- and that your brother was
in on it from the beginning.
- That's a lie!

990
01:27:29.185 --> 01:27:32.018
Yeah? I was your waitress on your birthday.
Connie told you about CRS that day.

991
01:27:32.146 --> 01:27:34.103
Ever seen me in there before?

992
01:27:34.231 --> 01:27:35.721
Sorry.

993
01:27:35.858 --> 01:27:39.852
It wasn't his fault.
I guess he thought it was his only way up.

994
01:27:40.029 --> 01:27:43.363
- They fleeced him real good.
- How? How did they get to him?

995
01:27:43.491 --> 01:27:46.654
- Did the same thing to him they did to you.
- What are you talking about?

996
01:27:46.786 --> 01:27:49.528
Have you checked your accounts?

997
01:27:49.705 --> 01:27:52.413
That night in your office I got
the number to your private line and modem.

998
01:27:52.541 --> 01:27:55.033
That gave CRS remote access to your computer.

999
01:27:55.169 --> 01:27:58.161
- You already gave them everything else.
- When?

1000
01:27:58.297 --> 01:28:01.255
You took their tests,
handwriting, voice samples, psych info.

1001
01:28:01.383 --> 01:28:04.501
They used it all to figure out your passwords.

1002
01:28:04.637 --> 01:28:07.629
And Feingold, the guy who signed you up...

1003
01:28:07.765 --> 01:28:10.632
he did five years for hacking Citibank.

1004
01:28:10.768 --> 01:28:13.851
They only had to keep you distracted while
they broke into your financial network,

1005
01:28:13.979 --> 01:28:17.313
- transferred your holdings into dummy accounts.
- Overseas operator, please.

1006
01:28:17.441 --> 01:28:19.432
Why else would they be willing to shoot at us?

1007
01:28:19.568 --> 01:28:22.731
Allgemeine Bank, Zurich, Switzerland.

1008
01:28:22.863 --> 01:28:25.230
'Cause they're finished with you.

1009
01:28:27.409 --> 01:28:29.867
Alive, dead, it's the same...

1010
01:28:29.995 --> 01:28:32.703
long as you disappear.

1011
01:28:32.832 --> 01:28:34.823
Guten Tag. Englisch, bitte.

1012
01:28:34.959 --> 01:28:37.246
<i>Ja. Can I have your code?</i>

1013
01:28:37.378 --> 01:28:39.460
Yes. Blue 2...

1014
01:28:39.588 --> 01:28:43.206
backslash 9-6-9-0...

1015
01:28:43.342 --> 01:28:45.925
D as in David.

1016
01:28:46.095 --> 01:28:49.929
That's right. The balance?

1017
01:28:53.185 --> 01:28:56.598
- That's impossible.
- They already got it, Nicholas.

1018
01:28:57.648 --> 01:28:59.730
They got everything.

1019
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:08.698
<i>You've reached the Sutherlands.
Please leave a message.</i>

1020
01:29:08.826 --> 01:29:11.158
As you get this message,
Sam, I have checked them all.

1021
01:29:11.287 --> 01:29:12.948
I don't know how,

1022
01:29:13.122 --> 01:29:16.410
but they have drained my accounts.

1023
01:29:16.542 --> 01:29:19.284
They're trying to kill me.
Now, you call the cops.

1024
01:29:19.461 --> 01:29:23.455
I've got one of them right here.
We'll make her testify.

1025
01:29:23.591 --> 01:29:25.548
I know how this sounds,

1026
01:29:25.676 --> 01:29:28.794
but you call me on my cellular,

1027
01:29:28.971 --> 01:29:31.463
and you be careful.

1028
01:29:31.599 --> 01:29:35.684
He, uh, cut your card in half, so...

1029
01:29:35.811 --> 01:29:38.394
it's, uh, my treat.

1030
01:30:16.477 --> 01:30:18.434
You take two sugars, right?

1031
01:30:19.897 --> 01:30:21.683
Never mind.

1032
01:30:27.238 --> 01:30:29.821
My name's not Christine.
I mean, it's not my real name.

1033
01:30:29.949 --> 01:30:32.031
Who fuckin' cares?

1034
01:30:33.369 --> 01:30:36.407
It's just money.
You should be glad you're alive.

1035
01:30:36.538 --> 01:30:39.200
I'd rather not talk about it right now.

1036
01:30:41.126 --> 01:30:44.118
- All I mean is, someone like you--
- How many times have you done this?

1037
01:30:44.255 --> 01:30:46.121
- I'm curious. These scams.
- What?

1038
01:30:46.257 --> 01:30:50.715
- Con games. How many?
- Lots.

1039
01:30:50.842 --> 01:30:53.211
Well, whatever nickel-dime
bullshit you pulled in the past...

1040
01:30:53.347 --> 01:30:55.463
this is more than just me.

1041
01:30:55.599 --> 01:30:59.217
This is pension plans, payrolls.

1042
01:30:59.353 --> 01:31:01.890
This is $600 million.

1043
01:31:15.536 --> 01:31:18.904
- Yes?
- <i>Nick, it's Sam. I got your message.</i>

1044
01:31:19.039 --> 01:31:21.872
- <i>I was disturbed, to say the least.</i>
- So what are we gonna do?

1045
01:31:22.001 --> 01:31:24.083
<i>I've been on the phone for an hour already.</i>

1046
01:31:24.253 --> 01:31:27.496
<i>Nicholas, your funds are intact.</i>

1047
01:31:27.631 --> 01:31:29.622
<i>Nothing's been touched.</i>

1048
01:31:29.758 --> 01:31:31.999
What are you talking about?
I checked on them myself.

1049
01:31:32.136 --> 01:31:34.002
- Who is it?
- I made the calls.

1050
01:31:34.138 --> 01:31:36.004
<i>Nothing's changed.</i>

1051
01:31:36.140 --> 01:31:38.928
<i>I'm telling you,
not one cent is unaccounted for.</i>

1052
01:31:39.059 --> 01:31:40.515
Who is it?

1053
01:31:40.644 --> 01:31:43.181
My attorney says that nothing is missing.

1054
01:31:43.314 --> 01:31:45.180
He's in on it.

1055
01:31:45.316 --> 01:31:49.731
- <i>I don't know what the hell is happening,
but stay where you are until I get there.</i>
- Sutherland's in on it.

1056
01:31:49.862 --> 01:31:53.605
<i>Nicholas, I have another call.
Give me your precise location.</i>

1057
01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:56.941
Nicholas?

1058
01:32:00.414 --> 01:32:02.701
I've got to get out of here.

1059
01:32:08.255 --> 01:32:11.122
How did they get to him?

1060
01:32:11.300 --> 01:32:13.132
Why did I...

1061
01:32:14.595 --> 01:32:17.303
I wouldn't worry about it.

1062
01:32:22.311 --> 01:32:24.143
What do you mean?

1063
01:32:25.356 --> 01:32:27.643
It's out of your hands.

1064
01:32:50.172 --> 01:32:53.005
Cellular calls can be intercepted, you know.

1065
01:32:54.301 --> 01:32:57.168
You know all those calls you made, BofA France,

1066
01:32:57.304 --> 01:33:00.592
BofA France, Switzerland, you were talking to us.

1067
01:33:00.724 --> 01:33:03.682
You filled in the blanks.

1068
01:33:03.811 --> 01:33:06.678
Access codes, passwords,

1069
01:33:06.814 --> 01:33:09.681
stuff even your lawyer didn't have.

1070
01:33:10.984 --> 01:33:12.975
But we have it now, so we're done.

1071
01:33:26.875 --> 01:33:28.741
Bye, Nicholas.

1072
01:35:43.345 --> 01:35:48.010
The embassy? American embassy?

1073
01:35:48.183 --> 01:35:50.390
- Por alla.
- Thank you.

1074
01:35:53.355 --> 01:35:56.518
Some things have happened,
and it's important that--

1075
01:35:56.650 --> 01:35:58.436
Shh, shh, shh.

1076
01:35:59.653 --> 01:36:02.145
No money, no identification,

1077
01:36:02.281 --> 01:36:04.363
no passport.

1078
01:36:06.326 --> 01:36:08.192
What happened to you?

1079
01:36:08.328 --> 01:36:11.161
Where to begin? Um...

1080
01:36:12.624 --> 01:36:14.706
- it's complicated.
- It always is.

1081
01:36:19.047 --> 01:36:22.165
I, um. I was on holiday alone

1082
01:36:22.301 --> 01:36:25.043
and I was robbed by two men--

1083
01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:27.006
Robbed?

1084
01:36:27.139 --> 01:36:29.380
What hotel were you staying at?

1085
01:36:29.558 --> 01:36:33.176
I, um... I don't remember. I, um...

1086
01:36:34.229 --> 01:36:36.186
Have you gone to the police?

1087
01:36:37.399 --> 01:36:39.356
I don't speak Spanish.

1088
01:36:41.695 --> 01:36:44.813
And I just need enough to get out of here.

1089
01:36:44.948 --> 01:36:47.940
We'll help with the local law enforcement,
if you want to bother.

1090
01:36:48.076 --> 01:36:50.317
As far as money is concerned...

1091
01:36:50.454 --> 01:36:52.536
can I make a suggestion?

1092
01:36:52.664 --> 01:36:55.031
You say you were mugged?

1093
01:36:55.167 --> 01:36:57.078
And they didn't take that watch?

1094
01:36:59.755 --> 01:37:01.712
How much is a watch like that worth?

1095
01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:04.548
A couple of hundred at least, hmm?

1096
01:37:08.013 --> 01:37:10.846
A man with a watch like that
doesn't necessarily have

1097
01:37:10.974 --> 01:37:12.931
a passport problem.

1098
01:38:37.394 --> 01:38:39.635
Excuse me.

1099
01:38:39.771 --> 01:38:42.012
Could I have your attention, please?

1100
01:38:46.778 --> 01:38:49.395
Thank you.

1101
01:38:49.531 --> 01:38:53.115
Anybody here going to San Francisco?
I need a ride.

1102
01:38:54.536 --> 01:38:57.528
I've got eighteen dollars

1103
01:38:57.664 --> 01:39:01.453
and seventy-eight cents...

1104
01:39:01.585 --> 01:39:03.701
for a ride to San Francisco.

1105
01:39:09.801 --> 01:39:11.667
Anybody?

1106
01:40:58.869 --> 01:41:00.826
- Keep the change.
- Thanks, man.

1107
01:41:04.332 --> 01:41:07.415
Conrad Van Orton.
Could you ring his room, please?

1108
01:41:08.503 --> 01:41:10.414
One moment, please.

1109
01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:15.837
Is there a problem?

1110
01:41:15.969 --> 01:41:17.835
- You're here for Conrad Van Orton?
- Yes.

1111
01:41:17.971 --> 01:41:20.732
- I'm the manager.
- It's a pleasure to meet you. Where is my brother?

1112
01:41:22.517 --> 01:41:25.851
- Will you come with me, sir?
- Wait a minute. Is there trouble?

1113
01:41:27.022 --> 01:41:29.480
Sir, this is a private matter for you.

1114
01:41:41.161 --> 01:41:44.574
There were some complaints by
other guests. Damage to his room.

1115
01:41:44.706 --> 01:41:47.368
We did the best we could
to accommodate his behavior.

1116
01:41:47.542 --> 01:41:48.998
- His behavior?
- Yes, sir.

1117
01:41:49.127 --> 01:41:51.038
There was an... incident

1118
01:41:51.212 --> 01:41:53.328
a few days ago.

1119
01:41:53.465 --> 01:41:55.331
A nervous breakdown, they said.

1120
01:41:55.467 --> 01:41:58.334
The police who took him...

1121
01:41:58.470 --> 01:42:01.132
they left this address in case anyone came.

1122
01:42:01.264 --> 01:42:02.846
It's a hospital in Napa, sir.

1123
01:42:05.101 --> 01:42:07.388
I'm terribly sorry.

1124
01:42:23.411 --> 01:42:26.369
Elizabeth, I need to borrow your car.

1125
01:42:26.498 --> 01:42:28.409
Nicky...

1126
01:42:29.501 --> 01:42:32.368
what happened to you? I mean...

1127
01:42:32.504 --> 01:42:35.166
- look at you.
- Look at me. What happened?

1128
01:42:35.298 --> 01:42:37.255
I don't know. I have some things I have to do.

1129
01:42:37.384 --> 01:42:39.045
I need your car.

1130
01:42:39.177 --> 01:42:41.794
Of course you can have it if you need it.

1131
01:42:43.974 --> 01:42:45.840
Can't I get you something to eat?

1132
01:42:47.102 --> 01:42:50.436
You know that you're
the only person that I can trust?

1133
01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:56.058
Everyone else, if Sam Sutherland calls you

1134
01:42:56.194 --> 01:42:58.060
you don't tell him you talked to me, you lie.

1135
01:42:58.196 --> 01:43:00.904
And whatever else happens before these people...

1136
01:43:01.032 --> 01:43:02.989
Okay. Coffee,

1137
01:43:03.118 --> 01:43:05.951
english muffin, and your water.

1138
01:43:07.122 --> 01:43:09.830
This bottle is open. Who opened this bottle?

1139
01:43:09.958 --> 01:43:12.245
- Yeah, I opened it.
- I don't want an opened bottle.

1140
01:43:12.377 --> 01:43:14.835
I want an unopened bottle.
And I don't want ice in my glass.

1141
01:43:14.963 --> 01:43:18.797
I want just a glass. Please.

1142
01:43:23.013 --> 01:43:26.756
Nicky, talk to me. You're scaring me.

1143
01:43:26.891 --> 01:43:29.007
I don't even know what you're saying.

1144
01:43:29.144 --> 01:43:31.602
I'm sorry, Liz. I don't mean it. I'm sorry.

1145
01:43:33.565 --> 01:43:36.148
You know, I've been...

1146
01:43:36.276 --> 01:43:38.142
thinking the last couple of days.

1147
01:43:38.278 --> 01:43:41.145
I've had some, uh, some spare time.

1148
01:43:43.241 --> 01:43:46.154
And I wanted to tell you...

1149
01:43:48.163 --> 01:43:51.201
I understand why you left me...

1150
01:43:51.332 --> 01:43:54.996
and I know that I resented it.

1151
01:43:59.007 --> 01:44:02.466
I want to apologize to you...

1152
01:44:02.594 --> 01:44:05.006
for shutting you out...

1153
01:44:05.138 --> 01:44:07.220
for not being there...

1154
01:44:07.348 --> 01:44:09.214
and I hope that you can forgive me.

1155
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:11.967
<i>You're tired.
You've been on the go for days.</i>

1156
01:44:12.103 --> 01:44:16.062
- There's nothing to forgive.
- <i>Then the pain sets in.</i>

1157
01:44:16.191 --> 01:44:20.651
<i>The onset of a migraine headache.
If this sounds all too familiar...</i>

1158
01:44:20.779 --> 01:44:24.989
- <i>relief is here at last.</i>
- Oh, no. You bastards!

1159
01:44:25.116 --> 01:44:28.529
<i>Taggarene. For nearly a decade,
doctors have been prescribing...</i>

1160
01:44:28.661 --> 01:44:31.995
- How did you find me here?
- <i>available in nonprescription strength.</i>

1161
01:44:32.123 --> 01:44:34.490
<i>Taggarene is strong medicine for headaches</i>

1162
01:44:34.626 --> 01:44:38.085
- <i>toothaches, muscle fatigue, joint pain.</i>
- He's an actor.

1163
01:44:38.213 --> 01:44:41.706
<i>So if you trust your doctor, trust Taggarene.</i>

1164
01:44:43.009 --> 01:44:45.876
He's an actor on television.

1165
01:44:47.347 --> 01:44:49.554
Someday I'll explain.

1166
01:44:49.724 --> 01:44:51.965
Could I borrow your Yellow Pages?

1167
01:44:53.645 --> 01:44:55.386
Thank you.

1168
01:45:15.917 --> 01:45:18.079
New Moon Cafe.

1169
01:45:18.211 --> 01:45:20.873
"Best in Chinatown."

1170
01:45:21.005 --> 01:45:22.871
Get out of the car, fucker.

1171
01:45:23.007 --> 01:45:24.714
Open the door and leave it running.

1172
01:45:24.843 --> 01:45:27.380
- You're making a mistake here.
- Get the fuck out of the car!

1173
01:45:27.512 --> 01:45:29.378
Get the fuck out of the car.

1174
01:45:29.514 --> 01:45:33.758
I am extremely fragile right now.

1175
01:45:43.278 --> 01:45:46.942
New Moon Cafe.

1176
01:45:47.073 --> 01:45:49.593
- He does commercials.
- Do you know how many customers we have?

1177
01:45:49.701 --> 01:45:52.284
- Hundreds. Thousands.
- I know he ordered from you.

1178
01:45:52.453 --> 01:45:56.287
It went to Montgomery Street. 1019 Montgomery--

1179
01:45:56.416 --> 01:45:58.327
Is there anybody here that can help me?

1180
01:45:58.459 --> 01:46:01.997
He's an actor. He's like one of these
people you have here up on your--

1181
01:46:15.435 --> 01:46:18.473
Hey! Where you taking my picture?

1182
01:46:18.605 --> 01:46:20.812
We were hoping he could audition today.

1183
01:46:20.940 --> 01:46:23.147
He'd really be perfect for this part.

1184
01:46:23.318 --> 01:46:25.275
<i>Oh, it'll break his heart.</i>

1185
01:46:25.403 --> 01:46:27.986
Well, is there any place we could contact him?

1186
01:46:28.114 --> 01:46:30.526
<i>Well, his beeper's here on the table.</i>

1187
01:46:30.658 --> 01:46:32.490
<i>He took the kids to the zoo.</i>

1188
01:46:32.619 --> 01:46:34.826
The zoo? That's very, very sweet.

1189
01:46:34.954 --> 01:46:37.116
- Which zoo?
- <i>The one with the white tiger.</i>

1190
01:46:41.211 --> 01:46:44.169
Lionel Fisher, I love your work.

1191
01:46:46.591 --> 01:46:50.334
Okay, please. Look, I, uh... I got my kids.

1192
01:46:51.429 --> 01:46:52.669
Get rid of 'em.

1193
01:46:52.805 --> 01:46:55.763
All right, guys, guys. Snack time, all right?

1194
01:46:55.892 --> 01:46:57.849
More snacks. Here. Go, go, go.

1195
01:46:59.437 --> 01:47:01.724
All right, look, uh...

1196
01:47:01.856 --> 01:47:03.813
it was just a job.

1197
01:47:03.942 --> 01:47:06.809
Nothing personal. You know, I play my part...

1198
01:47:06.945 --> 01:47:09.437
improvise a little.
I mean, it's what I'm good at.

1199
01:47:09.572 --> 01:47:13.315
- We need to talk. Who's in charge?
- Nobody knows.

1200
01:47:13.451 --> 01:47:16.193
Ain't nobody gets a big picture.

1201
01:47:16.329 --> 01:47:19.037
Hey, Tammy, Alex, cut it out.
Damn it. Why do they do that?

1202
01:47:19.165 --> 01:47:23.033
The offices are empty.
I need to find out where they are.

1203
01:47:26.130 --> 01:47:29.543
Look, they own the whole building.

1204
01:47:29.676 --> 01:47:31.587
They just move from floor to floor.

1205
01:47:31.719 --> 01:47:34.837
And you work for them, right?
You can get me in.

1206
01:47:34.973 --> 01:47:37.715
- No, I can't.
- Oh, yes, you can.

1207
01:47:37.850 --> 01:47:41.013
You can tell 'em the police called.
You gotta speak to somebody.

1208
01:47:41.145 --> 01:47:43.102
Tell them I'm gonna blow the whistle on them.

1209
01:47:43.231 --> 01:47:45.393
What whistle? There's no fucking whistle.

1210
01:47:45.525 --> 01:47:47.732
This is very dangerous.

1211
01:47:49.904 --> 01:47:53.067
I don't think that you understand.

1212
01:47:54.450 --> 01:47:56.691
Right now...

1213
01:47:56.828 --> 01:48:00.662
I am extremely dangerous.

1214
01:48:03.876 --> 01:48:05.617
Michael? Guys?

1215
01:48:05.753 --> 01:48:07.744
Come on. We're leaving.

1216
01:48:17.724 --> 01:48:20.056
Well, we're here.

1217
01:48:20.184 --> 01:48:22.095
Drive in.

1218
01:48:26.941 --> 01:48:29.182
What are you gonna do anyway?

1219
01:48:29.319 --> 01:48:31.185
You won't get your money back.

1220
01:48:31.321 --> 01:48:33.562
I don't care about money.

1221
01:48:33.698 --> 01:48:37.111
I'm pulling back the curtain.
I want to meet the wizard.

1222
01:48:39.746 --> 01:48:41.453
Hey.

1223
01:48:43.291 --> 01:48:45.578
He's eyeing us like Tiffany Towers.

1224
01:48:45.710 --> 01:48:47.792
Pull in somewhere where they won't see you.

1225
01:49:10.693 --> 01:49:12.934
Stay down, stay down, stay down.

1226
01:49:17.450 --> 01:49:19.316
You're not allowed to be here.

1227
01:49:19.452 --> 01:49:21.989
They called me back. I got a fitting.

1228
01:49:22.121 --> 01:49:24.488
He's with me.

1229
01:49:27.543 --> 01:49:29.580
- You don't need me.
- Shut up.

1230
01:49:30.797 --> 01:49:33.164
- Get in there.
- All right. Okay.

1231
01:49:33.341 --> 01:49:35.332
Cuff him to the rail.

1232
01:49:39.931 --> 01:49:41.922
What floor?

1233
01:50:01.035 --> 01:50:03.902
You're fucked. You're both,
you gotta listen to me.

1234
01:50:05.331 --> 01:50:07.663
- Where?
- I told you, they hired me over the phone.

1235
01:50:07.792 --> 01:50:10.534
- Where did you pick up your checks?
- It was a different floor then.

1236
01:50:10.670 --> 01:50:13.412
- Guess.
- Like, around this way, sort of.

1237
01:50:13.548 --> 01:50:15.289
I don't know. I--

1238
01:50:18.553 --> 01:50:20.715
All right, take it easy. Be cool.

1239
01:50:47.790 --> 01:50:50.908
Shh. It's gonna be a surprise.

1240
01:51:10.104 --> 01:51:11.765
Oh, fuck!

1241
01:51:13.691 --> 01:51:15.898
What are you doing here?

1242
01:51:16.027 --> 01:51:18.394
Back from the dead.

1243
01:51:28.206 --> 01:51:30.994
Nicholas, you're not about to shoot anyone.

1244
01:51:31.125 --> 01:51:32.866
Turn around.

1245
01:51:41.177 --> 01:51:43.339
You're gonna come with me.

1246
01:51:43.471 --> 01:51:45.462
Everybody down!

1247
01:52:06.911 --> 01:52:09.994
Where are we going?

1248
01:52:17.880 --> 01:52:19.416
Slop!

1249
01:52:27.431 --> 01:52:29.968
All right. What do you think you're doing?

1250
01:52:30.101 --> 01:52:32.342
You tell me!

1251
01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:35.387
Who's behind this? Who did this to me?

1252
01:52:35.523 --> 01:52:37.355
- Why?
- What do you mean, "why"?

1253
01:52:37.483 --> 01:52:39.684
- Who is responsible for this?
- How deluded can you be?

1254
01:52:39.694 --> 01:52:41.685
It wasn't you. It wasn't personal.

1255
01:52:41.862 --> 01:52:44.820
It could've been any asshole with
a couple hundred million in the bank.

1256
01:52:44.949 --> 01:52:48.362
Get on that radio. You get your boss up here.
You tell them I'm gonna shoot somebody.

1257
01:52:48.494 --> 01:52:50.374
Who am I gonna call, Nicholas? They won't do it.

1258
01:52:50.454 --> 01:52:54.243
Oh, yes, they will. You get somebody
up here, because I'm gonna kill you.

1259
01:52:54.375 --> 01:52:56.241
They don't care about me, Nicholas.
They'll let me die.

1260
01:52:56.377 --> 01:52:58.493
You're not in a position to threaten anyone.

1261
01:52:58.629 --> 01:53:01.087
- Wait a minute. Where'd you get that?
- What?

1262
01:53:01.215 --> 01:53:04.503
Th-That gun. That's not an automatic.

1263
01:53:04.635 --> 01:53:08.094
- What the fuck are you talkin' about?
- The guard had an automatic.
Where'd you get the gun?

1264
01:53:08.222 --> 01:53:10.805
- This is my gun.
- We-We searched the house.

1265
01:53:10.933 --> 01:53:13.516
Well, I guess you missed this, didn't you?

1266
01:53:13.644 --> 01:53:15.684
We got a situation here.
We got a real goddamn gun--

1267
01:53:15.813 --> 01:53:18.396
- What are you doing?
- Nicholas, it's fake.

1268
01:53:18.524 --> 01:53:21.391
- It's part of your game.
- Don't you start with me now!

1269
01:53:21.569 --> 01:53:23.276
- Don't fucking start with me!
- I'm telling you the truth!

1270
01:53:23.404 --> 01:53:26.112
- This is all the game.
- Bullshit, all right? Bullshit!

1271
01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:28.572
I know what happened to that guy.
They shot Feingold. They killed him!

1272
01:53:28.743 --> 01:53:30.859
- Think about it. What did you see?
- I saw them kill him!

1273
01:53:30.995 --> 01:53:33.157
No, what did you really,
really see this whole time?

1274
01:53:33.289 --> 01:53:36.702
Special effects. Squibs. Like in the movies.

1275
01:53:36.834 --> 01:53:39.075
Nicholas. Nicholas, listen.

1276
01:53:39.211 --> 01:53:43.079
Get up here. We've got a real gun with real
goddamn bullets! Okay, I'll put it down!

1277
01:53:45.843 --> 01:53:48.124
Feingold. Mr. Fisher.
He's on the other side of that door.

1278
01:53:48.179 --> 01:53:50.546
- He's an actor.
- He tried to kill me.

1279
01:53:50.681 --> 01:53:54.595
No one's trying to kill you. Please put
that gun down. You're about to make the
biggest mistake of your life.

1280
01:53:54.769 --> 01:53:57.261
There was always a safety net.
The taxi, there was a diver. My house,

1281
01:53:57.396 --> 01:54:00.058
- they just shot' at us with blanks!
- It's not true.

1282
01:54:00.191 --> 01:54:02.307
It is. It's what you hired us for.

1283
01:54:02.443 --> 01:54:05.323
They're waiting on the other side
of that door with champagne. Nicholas--

1284
01:54:07.406 --> 01:54:10.319
Please, goddamn it! Conrad, Conrad's there!

1285
01:54:10.451 --> 01:54:13.443
- It's your birthday party.
- You stop lying!

1286
01:54:16.666 --> 01:54:18.248
Let me show you.

1287
01:54:18.376 --> 01:54:21.368
Don't you move.

1288
01:54:22.755 --> 01:54:25.292
He's got a gun! Get back from the door!

1289
01:54:38.896 --> 01:54:40.978
You shot him!

1290
01:54:48.447 --> 01:54:50.609
Someone, someone call an ambulance!

1291
01:55:11.804 --> 01:55:13.465
He's dead.

1292
01:55:17.268 --> 01:55:19.680
We thought you knew.

1293
01:55:23.399 --> 01:55:26.687
How'd you let this get so out of hand?

1294
01:55:26.819 --> 01:55:29.436
He-he wouldn't listen to me.

1295
01:55:33.492 --> 01:55:36.029
We went through this over and over.

1296
01:55:40.207 --> 01:55:43.074
The mark is your responsibility.

1297
01:55:43.210 --> 01:55:45.577
You never, never,

1298
01:55:45.713 --> 01:55:47.875
let the mark take over.

1299
01:55:49.550 --> 01:55:51.882
- I'm sorry.
- He could've got us killed.

1300
01:55:52.052 --> 01:55:53.793
I'm sorry.

1301
01:55:53.929 --> 01:55:56.011
You had a walkie-talkie.

1302
01:55:56.140 --> 01:55:58.381
I used the walkie-talkie.

1303
01:56:00.436 --> 01:56:02.177
We're going to jail.

1304
01:56:02.313 --> 01:56:05.476
We're all going to jail
for the rest of our lives.

1305
01:56:16.035 --> 01:56:18.072
Oh, God.

1306
01:56:18.204 --> 01:56:20.241
Nicholas!

1307
01:56:55.741 --> 01:56:57.948
<i>We've got him. He's on the bag.</i>

1308
01:56:58.077 --> 01:57:01.536
<i>He came in right on target.
Stand by for further medical.</i>

1309
01:57:02.957 --> 01:57:06.075
<i>Keep everyone back until we've
cleared away the breakaway glass.</i>

1310
01:57:07.628 --> 01:57:09.744
Mr. Van Orton, don't open your eyes.

1311
01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:12.247
It's breakaway glass, but it can still cut you.

1312
01:57:14.593 --> 01:57:17.802
- Just gonna take a look at you.
- I'm gonna check your pulse.

1313
01:57:22.101 --> 01:57:25.765
Just take it easy. That was quite a fall.

1314
01:57:56.468 --> 01:57:59.460
Happy birthday, Nicky.

1315
01:58:11.025 --> 01:58:13.357
W-What is this?

1316
01:58:13.485 --> 01:58:15.852
It's your birthday present.

1317
01:58:36.967 --> 01:58:40.130
I had to do something.
You were becoming such an asshole.

1318
01:58:51.106 --> 01:58:53.473
Ladies and gentlemen,
my brother, Nicholas Van Orton.

1319
01:59:29.186 --> 01:59:33.100
Amazing! Great job!

1320
01:59:33.273 --> 01:59:35.184
This was the best ever.

1321
01:59:36.902 --> 01:59:39.064
Thank God you jumped, because if you didn't...

1322
01:59:39.196 --> 01:59:41.904
- I was supposed to throw you off.
- Thanks.

1323
01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:46.784
We have to head home.
I just wanted to say good-bye.

1324
01:59:46.912 --> 01:59:48.778
Rachel...

1325
01:59:48.914 --> 01:59:50.780
sweet dreams.

1326
01:59:52.251 --> 01:59:54.492
Thanks, Mel, for coming. Sorry about your car.

1327
01:59:54.628 --> 01:59:58.917
- I, uh, think I left it at the zoo.
- No problem.

1328
02:00:05.347 --> 02:00:07.258
Happy birthday, Nicholas.

1329
02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:12.473
I'll call you. I really will.

1330
02:00:27.411 --> 02:00:30.824
Nicholas, I haven't a clue
what this is all about,

1331
02:00:30.956 --> 02:00:33.288
but your taste in champagne is excellent,

1332
02:00:33.417 --> 02:00:36.284
- as always.
- It was a great entrance.

1333
02:00:37.671 --> 02:00:39.662
Anson, I want to you know that what happened--

1334
02:00:39.798 --> 02:00:41.664
Oh, no, no, no, please.

1335
02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:44.633
I've never been happier in my whole life.

1336
02:00:44.762 --> 02:00:48.096
I thank you, and my wife thanks you.

1337
02:00:49.975 --> 02:00:52.262
Thank you for coming.

1338
02:00:52.394 --> 02:00:54.351
Thank you, Sam.

1339
02:00:55.981 --> 02:00:57.813
What's this?

1340
02:00:57.941 --> 02:01:00.899
Oh, this is...

1341
02:01:01.028 --> 02:01:03.395
the bill.

1342
02:01:03.530 --> 02:01:05.567
The bill?

1343
02:01:05.699 --> 02:01:08.487
Keep the pen.

1344
02:01:08.619 --> 02:01:11.361
Thank you both.

1345
02:01:17.044 --> 02:01:18.876
You want to split it?

1346
02:01:19.004 --> 02:01:21.666
Oh, God, yes, please.
I'll take you up on that.

1347
02:01:23.050 --> 02:01:24.882
Oh, my God.

1348
02:01:29.765 --> 02:01:31.972
Thank you, Connie.

1349
02:01:35.229 --> 02:01:38.142
What happened to that, uh, waitress?

1350
02:01:38.273 --> 02:01:41.061
What was her name? Um... Christine?

1351
02:01:41.193 --> 02:01:43.525
She said something about catching a plane.

1352
02:01:43.654 --> 02:01:46.066
I just saw her out front trying to hail a cab.

1353
02:02:05.342 --> 02:02:06.958
Christine?

1354
02:02:09.263 --> 02:02:12.381
I, um, I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

1355
02:02:12.516 --> 02:02:14.757
Well, thank you. I-I-I, um...

1356
02:02:14.893 --> 02:02:18.227
- You know, I never did ask you your name, did I?
- No.

1357
02:02:18.355 --> 02:02:21.973
It's... Claire.

1358
02:02:22.109 --> 02:02:25.022
So you, uh, catching a plane or...

1359
02:02:25.154 --> 02:02:28.067
Yeah, we have a gig starting
next week in Australia, so...

1360
02:02:28.198 --> 02:02:30.064
Gonna shear some more sheep?

1361
02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:33.692
- Just a walk-on this time.
- Well, when you get back, um...

1362
02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:34.000


1363
02:02:36.623 --> 02:02:39.035
maybe, you know, we could have some dinner.

1364
02:02:40.502 --> 02:02:42.709
You don't know anything about me.

1365
02:02:42.838 --> 02:02:44.670
No, I don't.

1366
02:02:44.798 --> 02:02:46.505
So you tell me.

1367
02:02:46.633 --> 02:02:48.169
- Well, what--
- Where you're from.

1368
02:02:48.343 --> 02:02:50.209
Oh. Um...

1369
02:02:50.345 --> 02:02:53.303
Originally, huh? Oklahoma.

1370
02:02:54.349 --> 02:02:56.841
Colorado?

1371
02:02:58.353 --> 02:03:01.391
I've been doing this way too long.

1372
02:03:03.734 --> 02:03:05.691
You know, uh,

1373
02:03:07.321 --> 02:03:09.232
would you like to

1374
02:03:09.364 --> 02:03:12.197
have a coffee with me at the airport?
