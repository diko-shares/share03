00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.430
Financial times, 100 index of 11
points just above the key 3,800 level.

2
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.390
As for the rest of Europe, Frankfurt's
DAX gaining 9 points to 25.32.

3
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.400
In Paris, the CAC-40 losing 7, the
weaker franc weighing on the market.

4
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.540
Thank you, Ilsa.

5
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.580
Have a nice day.

6
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.180
Actually are on time this morning
according to dispatchers.

7
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.140
San Francisco's freeways are...

8
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.580
Good morning, Sir.

9
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.660
Well, tell me what
we're supposed to do.

10
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.870
I mean, you may be perched
on majority shares,

11
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.710
but we all get fucked
if the actuals crash.

12
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.540
That old man is
going to sink us.

13
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.840
Soon as I have Baer-Grant's
P and I report in hand

14
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.590
I will be speed-dialing
your number.

15
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.640
Is that a promise? I'm sorry,
I'm not aware of that term.

16
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.560
Well, what do I do if Anson calls
about substantiation procedure?

17
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.430
Take evasive action. Have your
secretary say you're in a meeting.

18
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.100
Thank you, Jack.

19
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.810
Yes, Maria. Invitations.

20
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.650
Mmm-hmm. The museum gala.

21
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.820
No. The Fitzwilliam botanical
annual fundraiser.

22
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.200
No. The Hinchberger wedding.

23
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.660
Hinchberger wedding.

24
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.490
Tuxedos, droning conversations.
I don't think so. No.

25
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.870
I'll send your regrets.

26
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.160
Honestly, why must I bother?

27
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.000
You don't know about
society, Maria.

28
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.960
You don't have the
satisfaction of avoiding it.

29
00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.500
Yes.

30
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.840
I have an Elizabeth on line 3.

31
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.970
Your ex-wife.

32
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.550
I know who it is.

33
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.220
Take a message.

34
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.810
Oh, Happy Birthday, sir.

35
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.440
Thank you, Maggie.

36
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.230
I don't like her.

37
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.530
I wouldn't even mention the
following, but he was very insistent.

38
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.990
It's obviously some sort of prank.
What?

39
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.200
Well, a gentleman called
requesting to have lunch with you.

40
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.330
I tried to assure him that you
were very busy... What's his name?

41
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.200
A Mr. Seymour Butts.

42
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.130
Under the Bleachers
by Seymour Butts.

43
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.210
I'm sorry?

44
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.260
Cancel my lunch. Make a reservation at
the City Club for myself and Mr. Butts.

45
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.760
My usual table.

46
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.510
Maria, put the reservation
under my name.

47
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.900
You ready to order, sir?
No, I'm still waiting.

48
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.690
This was ice tea.

49
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.160
Conrad, what a surprise.

50
00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.830
Happy Birthday, Nickie.

51
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.540
Seymour Butts.

52
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.790
I'll never get
tired of that one.

53
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.960
That's why it's a classic.
This is a nice restaurant.

54
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.080
They gave me a free jacket.

55
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.040
I'm sure they're
gonna want it back.

56
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.840
I remember being here
a long time ago.

57
00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.010
Yeah, I took you here once.

58
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.630
No. I used to buy crystal
meth off the maitre d'.

59
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.760
Oh, really?

60
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.890
In college.

61
00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:29.930
Which college?

62
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.760
TouchÃ©.

63
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.100
Miss me?

64
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.520
As much as that's possible.

65
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.600
You look good.

66
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.690
So do you.

67
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:39.900
To think I was worried.

68
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.110
Worried about me?

69
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.190
How long has it been since Mom's funeral?
Two, three years?

70
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:47.990
I thought you quit.

71
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.070
I did. It didn't take.

72
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.780
Well, you can't smoke here.

73
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:53.620
I'm with you.

74
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.910
It's illegal to smoke in
restaurants in California.

75
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.670
Fuck California.

76
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.130
How are you?

77
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.590
Couldn't be better.

78
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:04.800
Elizabeth?

79
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.180
We're divorced. She remarried a
pediatrician or a gynecologist,

80
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.300
or a pediatric gynecologist.
Lives in, uh, Sausalito.

81
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.260
That's too bad.

82
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.230
I liked her.

83
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.310
And what about you?

84
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.480
What, you don't keep
track of me anymore?

85
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.360
Not since family week at rehab.

86
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.480
So what brings you
to town, Conrad?

87
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:25.780
Everything all right?

88
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.860
Yeah. Need anything?

89
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.320
Nope. Really?

90
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.950
No I don't need anything from you.
I just

91
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.870
found myself laying naked
on the beach near Ibiza,

92
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.500
and all of a sudden it clicked.

93
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.040
October 12th.

94
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.880
Nickie's birthday.

95
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.330
October 11th.

96
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.000
Whatever.

97
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.840
This is for you.

98
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.010
You shouldn't have.

99
00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.430
What do you get for the
man who has everything?

100
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.100
"Consumer Recreation Services."

101
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.810
Well, I do have golf clubs.

102
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:04.360
Call that number.

103
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:06.150
Why?

104
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.280
It'll make your life fun.

105
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.410
Fun?

106
00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.990
You know what that is?
You've seen other people have it.

107
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.540
It's an entertainment service.

108
00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.160
An escort service?

109
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.420
A profound life experience.

110
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.710
Sorry. I'll just...

111
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:25.170
No, that's all right. Just...

112
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:28.050
Tell me you'll call.

113
00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:30.050
I said I would. No, you didn't.

114
00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.890
You still on medication?

115
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:36.720
Why would you say that?

116
00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.310
You gentlemen ready to order?

117
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:39.850
I didn't mean it the
way it sounded.

118
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:42.690
I'm not on anything.
I'm not even seeing a shrink.

119
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:44.480
And I feel great.

120
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.860
Do you mind?

121
00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.740
I think you'll like this. I did.

122
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.450
And it was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

123
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.410
I'll call them.

124
00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.120
Do it. For you.

125
00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.750
I said I'll call, okay?
All right, I'll call.

126
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.750
It's just that, uh,
I hate surprises.

127
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:05.880
I know.

128
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:14.970
Happy Birthday to you.

129
00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.930
Happy Birthday, Mr. Van Orton.

130
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.900
Happy Birthday to you.

131
00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.520
Thank you.

132
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.740
Someone's got to fly to Seattle and
drive a stake through Anson's heart.

133
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.280
Have you seen the
profitability report?

134
00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.870
You can imagine how
much more unhappy I am.

135
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.990
So, you're gonna deal with Anson?
That's correct.

136
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.410
We're furious.

137
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:41.620
Sleep well, Nicholas.

138
00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:42.790
I will.

139
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:43.940
Good night, Ilsa.

140
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:45.600
Dinner's in the oven.

141
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.820
Thank you. Oh, I
saw Conrad today.

142
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.070
Did you? How is he?

143
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:52.650
He's okay.

144
00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.070
I think he's in one of those

145
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.360
personal improvement
cults or something.

146
00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:58.740
Well, send my love if
you see him again.

147
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:01.330
Happy Birthday. Goodnight.

148
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:12.090
Aw.

149
00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:33.240
From companies that defaulted
on their payments.

150
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.870
The FCC expects to receive
more than $500 million in bids

151
00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:40.450
as the licenses eagerly soar...

152
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.410
Elizabeth, good evening.

153
00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:43.950
Happy Birthday, Nickie.

154
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.420
1140.

155
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.210
You almost missed it this year.

156
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.750
Have you had a nice birthday?

157
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:52.130
Does Rose Kennedy
have a black dress?

158
00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:55.970
I went, not once, but twice
through the spanking machine.

159
00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.260
I can only imagine.

160
00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.470
How are you?

161
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.350
Connie asked me the
same thing today.

162
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:03.430
Connie? Really?

163
00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.480
I've always liked your brother.

164
00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:08.360
Anyway...

165
00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.150
I... I just thought

166
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:11.730
this might be
difficult for you...

167
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.360
Just another birthday.

168
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.410
Because of your father.

169
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.120
That's right.
He was 48, wasn't he?

170
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.620
I hadn't really thought
about it until now.

171
00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.200
Why do I call?

172
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.960
I honestly don't know.

173
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.250
Please send Dr.
Mel and Rachel my best.

174
00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.800
She has a little
brother on the way.

175
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.010
We did the ultrasound.

176
00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.130
Official nuclear family.

177
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:39.930
You must be very pleased.

178
00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.260
We are.

179
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.020
We are very pleased.

180
00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:45.270
Well, it's good
to talk with you.

181
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.100
I guess I should let you go.

182
00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:49.980
Take care of yourself.

183
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.820
You too, Nicholas. I mean that.

184
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.190
I really do. Uh-huh.
Be well. Bye.

185
00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:59.530
A proposal to encourage small
businesses to provide their employees

186
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:03.830
with health insurance is now being
debated by Washington legislators.

187
00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.710
The bill which attaches a
small-business health plan

188
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:08.750
to those of larger corporations

189
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:12.960
is receiving initial support from a
number of key Republican leaders.

190
00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.880
However, Democratic lawmakers
are voicing serious concerns

191
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:21.050
about the bill, claiming that it
would undermine local efforts...

192
00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:49.710
I just wanna make sure that
we understand each other.

193
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:53.960
Once you get it down on paper then
you can count on my full support.

194
00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.960
We understand that. Thank you.

195
00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:58.170
We'll talk soon.

196
00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.920
Well, you shouldn't feel this
reflects negatively on you.

197
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.340
I do feel that it reflects
negatively on me.

198
00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.220
I received this...
Just a moment.

199
00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.850
I took these tests
in good faith.

200
00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:45.560
I'm sorry you feel that way.

201
00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.470
I understand.

202
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.640
We hope we haven't caused
you any inconvenience.

203
00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.770
Thank you for choosing CRS.

204
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.730
Mr. Feingold, could you
assist this gentleman?

205
00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:56.730
Oh, yeah. Sure.

206
00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.030
Jim Feingold, VP
Engineering, Data Analysis.

207
00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:02.570
I don't know exactly how this works.
My brother sent me this card...

208
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:04.490
Oh, here we go. Yeah.
...as a gift.

209
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.120
All right, excellent.
Well, let's get started.

210
00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:11.290
Yeah, I'm sorry about the...
You know, all this hullabaloo here.

211
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.000
We're, uh... Well,
we're still moving.

212
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.920
I got an office around
here somewhere.

213
00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.010
You mind holding that?

214
00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:24.050
Thank you very much.

215
00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:28.100
Thank you.

216
00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.060
Are you hungry? New Moon Cafe.

217
00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.140
No, thank you.

218
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:32.650
Next to Chinatown.

219
00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.280
A gift from Conrad Van Orton.

220
00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:43.360
Interesting. What is?

221
00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.330
Well, your brother was a
client with our London branch.

222
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.740
We do a sort of
informal scoring,

223
00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:51.370
and his numbers are outstanding.

224
00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:52.750
Really? Hmm.

225
00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.670
You sure you're not hungry?
No, thank you.

226
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:58.550
Okay, fine. Now, you need
to fill out these forms.

227
00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:00.460
There's an application

228
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:03.340
and then a couple of psych-tests there.
A MNPI and a PAP.

229
00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.550
Oh, uh, for the financial
questionnaire,

230
00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:07.350
don't answer anything
you don't feel like.

231
00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:09.600
We'll run our TRW.

232
00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:13.270
"I sometimes hurt small
animals, true or false"?

233
00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.280
"I feel guilty when
I masturbate."

234
00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.940
Well, I don't write
the questions.

235
00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.160
I just review the answers.

236
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:29.540
What is this for?

237
00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.160
Well, to give us an overall
sense of your capability...

238
00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.080
No, what is this for?
What are you selling?

239
00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:37.420
Oh.

240
00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.920
It's a game. A game?

241
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.720
Specifically tailored
for each participant.

242
00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:46.350
Think of it as a great vacation.
Except you don't go to it,

243
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:48.100
it comes to you.

244
00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.220
What... What kind of vacation?

245
00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:52.680
It's different every time.

246
00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.400
Humor me with specifics.

247
00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:56.230
We provide

248
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.990
whatever's lacking.

249
00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:02.900
And what if nothing is lacking?

250
00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.400
May I make two suggestions?

251
00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:07.490
You really think that I'll
participate without knowing any...

252
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:11.160
First, admit to yourself
that it sounds intriguing.

253
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.080
Second, you don't
have to decide today.

254
00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.290
Take the silly test, fill
out the stupid forms.

255
00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:20.760
One day, your game begins. You either
love it or hate it. Decide then.

256
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:23.470
You know we... We are like

257
00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.600
an experiential
book-of-the-month club.

258
00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:30.930
You can drop out at any time
with no further obligation.

259
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:34.730
That was my sales pitch.

260
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:37.230
How long will this take?

261
00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.860
About an hour for those,
another hour for the physical.

262
00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:42.320
Physical? It's a
cursory examination,

263
00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:46.110
turn-your-head, cough sort of thing.
You'll be out of here in no time.

264
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:36.120
Confused.

265
00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:43.170
Risky.

266
00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.340
Bloody.

267
00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.270
Whoops.

268
00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:16.580
Mr. Sutherland called about
Baer-Grant Publishing.

269
00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.460
Cancel it. Push it
back till Wednesday.

270
00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.210
And Anson Baer called about tomorrow.
Tomorrow?

271
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:23.550
Yes, that's correct. How much
longer is this going to take?

272
00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:25.760
Shouldn't be long.
We're almost done.

273
00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.670
You said that two hours ago.

274
00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.220
All right. Put it
back until tomorrow.

275
00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:31.550
Selection before the following
emotional responses.

276
00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.680
You have 0.9 seconds to enter
your emotional response.

277
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:37.440
Reaction time is a factor.

278
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:43.400
Please make a selection for the
following emotional responses.

279
00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.240
You have 0.9 seconds to enter
your emotional response.

280
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:51.410
Does this thing end?

281
00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.800
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

282
00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:12.180
Oh, don't worry. It's been just
terrific spending my entire day

283
00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.260
with your crack team.

284
00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.930
Well, it's all down to this.

285
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:17.640
This is an insurance company requirement.
It states that you're aware

286
00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.890
that the game exists, that you're a
willing participant in said game,

287
00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.150
so on and so forth.
Our guarantee, payment's entirely

288
00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:26.900
at your brother's discretion as a gift.
It's dependent on your satisfaction.

289
00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.280
Does that mean that if I'm not
happy he doesn't have to pay?

290
00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.910
That's never happened. We've never
had an unsatisfied customer.

291
00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:33.780
I think you mean, dissatisfied.

292
00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.120
That's right. You're a
left-brained word fetishist.

293
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.910
Initials, initials,
and sign there

294
00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:40.080
in blood.

295
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.250
Just kidding.

296
00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.630
All right. Now, your copy will be
at the front desk in this folder.

297
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.630
And I'll... Keep the pen.

298
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:50.220
We'll let you know.

299
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.010
What about Monday or Tuesday?

300
00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:56.430
No, that's bad for me.

301
00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:57.520
Well, how about tonight?

302
00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.890
Well, I'm working
all this evening.

303
00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:03.520
Wednesday is the only
possibility right now.

304
00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.810
Do you wanna do dinner?

305
00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:06.360
Okay.

306
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.490
By the way, I went to CRS.

307
00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:11.660
Really? What did you think?

308
00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.700
Well they seemed just a
little bit disorganized.

309
00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:17.830
Well, when I did it in London
they'd been around a while.

310
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:19.330
Are you gonna do this?

311
00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:21.370
No, I haven't decided yet.

312
00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:28.130
Telling you, it's like getting in on the
ground floor of the next Disneyland.

313
00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:31.430
CRS won't go public.
They're family-owned.

314
00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:33.720
Stranger things have happened.

315
00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.680
No, they haven't, actually.

316
00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.100
They opened here.

317
00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.100
The game in San Francisco?

318
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:42.900
See? They're doing fine
without any of us.

319
00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.650
Nicholas. How are you?

320
00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:51.190
James, good evening.
Good evening, sir.

321
00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.860
We have new members here?

322
00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.700
Believe so, sir.

323
00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.580
Put their next round on me.

324
00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:57.700
Got you, sir.

325
00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.420
No, no, no, no.

326
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:06.340
Last time I played Pebble I swore I'd
never pick up another club again.

327
00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.670
Speaking about games...

328
00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:13.050
Couldn't help but overhear
you talking about CRS.

329
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:19.930
Well, the reason I mention it is I took the
test today at the Montgomery Street office.

330
00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:21.810
You did? Kudos.

331
00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.060
So, yours hasn't started yet?

332
00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:27.730
No, not yet. That was one of
the questions I had for you.

333
00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:30.690
What is it? Oh, what is it?

334
00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:32.150
The eternal question.

335
00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:34.410
You know, I envy you.

336
00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:39.330
I wish I could go back and do it
for the first time all over again.

337
00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:44.540
Here's to new experiences.

338
00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.260
Hmm, if you'll excuse
me, I got to go.

339
00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:51.960
Good night, Ted.

340
00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:53.840
Nicholas. Nice to meet you.

341
00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:59.220
So, you played recently?

342
00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:01.270
Oh, about a year ago.

343
00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.600
I was working in Los Angeles.

344
00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:07.520
Oh, I hear the London
office is very good, too...

345
00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.980
It sounds like a lot of fantasy,
role-playing nonsense, though.

346
00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.110
You wanna know what it is?

347
00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.450
What it's all about?

348
00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:21.490
John chapter 0 verse 25.

349
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:22.790
I, um,

350
00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.160
haven't been to Sunday
school in a long time.

351
00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:26.630
"Whereas once I was blind,"

352
00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.040
"now I can see."

353
00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:32.920
Good night, Nicholas.

354
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:34.930
Best of luck.

355
00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:36.640
Goodnight.

356
00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.280
If the Baer-Grant meeting

357
00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:57.320
is not held tomorrow

358
00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:00.990
may as well not be held at all.

359
00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:05.830
When Mr. Van Orton boards
his plane on the morrow

360
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:09.840
he will have every agreement and
addendum in the complete closing package

361
00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.460
flawlessly revised.

362
00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:14.720
So you will miss another opera you
would have slept during anyway.

363
00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:17.510
We now have an opportunity
to show our clients

364
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:20.760
how well we will rise to his
exhilarating challenge.

365
00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:25.060
Yes. Nicholas Van Orton?

366
00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.690
Who is this? This is
Cynthia from CRS.

367
00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:28.940
How did you get this number?

368
00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:31.020
We've finished processing
your application.

369
00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:32.400
Look, I'm in a
meeting right now.

370
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.240
I'm afraid it was rejected.

371
00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.110
I beg your pardon? You shouldn't feel
this reflects negatively on you.

372
00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:39.910
We hope we haven't caused
you any inconvenience.

373
00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:42.790
Oh, this is ridiculous.
Thank you for thinking of CRS.

374
00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.620
Anything wrong?

375
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:47.580
Uh, no. No, nothing's...

376
00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:53.590
You may hang up or press
pound for more options.

377
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:56.130
Oh, this is Conrad.
Leave a message.

378
00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:00.550
Yes, Connie, it's Nicholas.
Give me a ring when you get in.

379
00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:04.680
Oh, uh, regarding your
birthday present,

380
00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.230
um, things are a little
crazy right now.

381
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:08.940
I don't really know if I
can fit it in my schedule.

382
00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.270
But we'll talk about
it at dinner tomorrow.

383
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:12.690
Thanks, bye.

384
00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.730
Hello.

385
00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:50.750
The resulting rise of
unemployment and decline

386
00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:53.000
into buyable small businesses.

387
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.840
Meanwhile, Republican leaders
argue that this passage

388
00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:59.300
would be the very stimulant
that a sluggish economy needs.

389
00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:02.680
No one has expressed an opinion
as to how it will impact

390
00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.430
the pampered existence
of Nicholas Van Orton.

391
00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:09.180
The one thing on which both Democrats
and Republicans seem to agree

392
00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:13.440
is that most Americans harbor serious
doubts about the economic future.

393
00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:18.570
A recent poll suggests a staggering
57% of American workers believe

394
00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:23.660
there is a very real chance they will be
unemployed within the next 5 to 7 years.

395
00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:28.500
But what does that matter to a bloated
millionaire fat cat like you?

396
00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:33.670
In other financial news, stock markets
rose both domestically and abroad today

397
00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:36.380
after the announcement of
stronger than expected earnings

398
00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.550
by several high tech companies

399
00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:43.180
but dipped again reacting to reports
that Nicholas Van Orton had sneezed.

400
00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:49.810
Are you gonna spend the rest of the
evening prying at that clown's mouth?

401
00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:55.610
I... I don't... It's frustrating
for me if you don't pay attention.

402
00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.860
What is this?

403
00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:03.070
This is your game, Nicholas,
and welcome to it.

404
00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.370
I'm here to let you in
on a few ground rules.

405
00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:10.830
You received the very first
key, and others will follow.

406
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.920
You'll never know where you'll find
them or how you'll need to use them.

407
00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.840
So keep your eyes open.

408
00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:19.250
How do you... You can see me?

409
00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.720
Let us save the questions
till afterwards.

410
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:25.430
How does this work?

411
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:30.730
There's a tiny camera
looking at you right now.

412
00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.940
It's impossible.
You're right, impossible.

413
00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.780
You're having a conversation
with your television.

414
00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:43.240
It's miniaturized.

415
00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.450
You know how dangerous that is?

416
00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.710
Mr. Van Orton?
And in domestic news,

417
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:57.790
in Southern California...
Yes, Ilsa. What is it?

418
00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:59.880
Is everything all right?

419
00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.170
It's fine. It's...

420
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:03.800
in the petroleum processing
plant yesterday.

421
00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.760
I've finished for the evening.
Will you be needing anything else?

422
00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.350
No, I won't, Ilsa. Thank you.
Good night.

423
00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:11.520
Good night, then.

424
00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.100
In a petroleum processing
plant yesterday.

425
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.400
Several workers were injured in the...
Who was that?

426
00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.980
Never mind who that is.

427
00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.570
You wanna know how a camera got
into your home, don't you?

428
00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:22.990
Yes, I would.

429
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:31.830
Cold.

430
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:35.120
Colder.

431
00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:40.960
Warm.

432
00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:46.470
Warmer.

433
00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.360
Write this number down.

434
00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:07.910
It's a 24-hour Consumer
Recreation Services hotline.

435
00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:09.370
For emergencies only.

436
00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:12.370
But don't call asking what
the object of the game is.

437
00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:15.250
Figuring that out is the
object of the game.

438
00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:20.130
Good luck and congratulations
on choosing CRS.

439
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:24.300
Regret to have the American ambassador
expelled after the incident.

440
00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:28.090
US State Department responded
quickly with a formal apology.

441
00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:31.890
An announcement of the ambassador's
immediate voluntary removal...

442
00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.740
Hey, buddy, spare any change?

443
00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:53.410
Help me out here, huh? Huh?

444
00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.890
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

445
00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.300
May I help you?

446
00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:35.930
What is it?

447
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.100
What?

448
00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.530
Thank you.

449
00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:05.710
Buddy?

450
00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.550
Can you help me out?

451
00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:14.600
I need some toilet paper.
I ran out.

452
00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.480
Just... Just go into
the next stall.

453
00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:23.560
Come on, help me out.

454
00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.020
Hello?

455
00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:28.900
Hello?

456
00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:35.530
Didn't expect to see you here.

457
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:37.200
I wanted to wish you luck.

458
00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:38.950
Been up all night?

459
00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.910
I checked it. Personally.

460
00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.460
I appreciate that, Sam. Why don't
you go home and get some sleep?

461
00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:46.170
You're sure you don't want me along?
No, I'll be fine.

462
00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:48.090
Hmm, nice shirt.

463
00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:49.970
Don't ask.

464
00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:51.430
Ciao!

465
00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:18.530
All of these years,

466
00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:21.580
the first time ever you've
stepped foot in these offices,

467
00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:23.830
it's to ask me to step down.

468
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.210
You promised to meet the
projections, Anson.

469
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:28.500
$1.60 a share is what you said.

470
00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.970
I don't think this visit
comes as a surprise.

471
00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:33.930
Projections were far
too optimistic.

472
00:34:33.930 --> 00:34:35.180
Admittedly, yes.

473
00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:37.930
Our EPS was 150 last quarter.
We're up 6 cents...

474
00:34:37.930 --> 00:34:41.980
The expectations were 10, and in this
case the expectations meant everything.

475
00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:45.230
Will you really hold
me to it over pennies?

476
00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.690
My stock is falling.
I don't know about yours.

477
00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:50.690
Those pennies are costing millions.
Give me...

478
00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:52.490
Give me next quarter.

479
00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:54.570
If you still feel this
way, vote your shares...

480
00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:56.320
Today is what counts, Anson.

481
00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:00.790
You...

482
00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.790
You intractable son of a bitch.

483
00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:06.170
If your father
could see you now.

484
00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:08.460
What? Your father was a friend.

485
00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:11.510
A friend! God damn it.
I've watched you grow up.

486
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:15.550
Because you went fishing with my
father I should sit on my hands

487
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:17.300
while you're throwing
my money away?

488
00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.100
I will tell you...
I'm not finished.

489
00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:22.270
Now, you misspoke before when
you said you're stepping down.

490
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:25.520
I am firing you.

491
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:29.270
Action is taken.
Confidence is restored.

492
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:31.820
The stock goes up. No.

493
00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:35.530
There's no Baer-Grant
Publishing...

494
00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:39.910
No Baer-Grant Publishing
without Anson Baer.

495
00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.450
Where's Stewart Grant?
He's probably out there sailing

496
00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:46.710
enjoying his golden years wondering
where the hell you are, Anson.

497
00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.210
I'm sorry.

498
00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:51.550
You failed.

499
00:35:55.680 --> 00:36:00.010
I have prepared a severance
package that is more than

500
00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:01.260
equitable.

501
00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:04.850
Valid until this evening.

502
00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:08.980
I could fight you on this.

503
00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:12.070
If I leave without
your signature,

504
00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.240
this agreement begins
to disintegrate.

505
00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:18.200
Benefits shrink, options narrow

506
00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.620
and your compensation
will be shriveled.

507
00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:29.130
I think it's in your

508
00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:31.170
best interest, Anson, to...

509
00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:49.110
Well, I guess this is your

510
00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:51.480
lucky day.

511
00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:54.820
My lawyers will be
in touch with you.

512
00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:31.150
Excuse me. Has Conrad Van
Orton left a message?

513
00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:32.820
I'll check on it right away, Mr.
Van Orton.

514
00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.070
Thank you.

515
00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:43.080
Oh, I'm so sorry. Here.

516
00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.080
Please, don't do that.

517
00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:47.080
I'm so sorry.
I wasn't even looking.

518
00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:49.080
I'm really having a bad day.

519
00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:50.330
How about a bad month?

520
00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:53.670
You did almost exactly the same thing
to me when I was here last week.

521
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:55.170
Here. Don't do that.

522
00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:58.550
Just get me some napkins
and some soda water.

523
00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.390
Looks like the, uh,

524
00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:03.350
cleaning bill's gonna
be more than the suit.

525
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.350
I don't think so.

526
00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.890
It was an accident, sir.
Terrific.

527
00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:10.810
I said I was sorry.

528
00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:16.690
Asshole. Christine!

529
00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:18.400
Mr. Van Orton is a
valued customer.

530
00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.160
Fine. Then you kiss his ass.

531
00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.070
Don't you talk to me like that.

532
00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:23.240
I apologized,

533
00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.830
I offered to help.
What do you want me to do?

534
00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:26.040
Clean out your locker.

535
00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:27.700
What? You heard me.

536
00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:33.710
I'm terribly sorry, Mr.
Van Orton.

537
00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:35.040
If you're not too uncomfortable,

538
00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:37.260
will this table suit you
for a complimentary meal?

539
00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:38.550
It'll be fine.

540
00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:47.850
I'll fetch your waiter.

541
00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:48.980
Thank you.

542
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:51.810
Check, sir.

543
00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:16.340
Fucking lamb vichyssoise,
you little...

544
00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:18.760
Miss. Pardon me, miss.

545
00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.260
Oh, great. It's you.

546
00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:24.720
I don't know how this works, but
do you have something for me?

547
00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:25.970
I, uh...

548
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.220
I received this note...

549
00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:30.930
What're you babbling
about, psycho?

550
00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:33.190
I need to know what is going on.

551
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:34.440
You wanna know what's going on?

552
00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:38.570
I'm going on my second job this month. Now
it looks like I'm going on unemployment.

553
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:40.820
Maybe I should try to explain...

554
00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:43.410
Don't explain, just fuck off.

555
00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:48.240
Son of a bitch!

556
00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:52.210
I am... I'm trying to...
I'm apologizing. I...

557
00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:06.560
Jesus, what is this?

558
00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.270
What's with him? I don't know, he just...
He fell down.

559
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:14.480
Can you hear me?

560
00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:17.440
Do you know what to do? I don't
even know if he's breathing.

561
00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.440
Here you are.

562
00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:20.490
Move your head.

563
00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:23.110
Don't stand there. Get help.

564
00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:25.530
Hey, hey. It's okay.

565
00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:27.450
We're gonna get help.

566
00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:29.950
How do we know he's real?

567
00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:33.830
He's pissed his pants, mister.
Is that real enough for you?

568
00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:35.460
Oh, good God.

569
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:37.540
He's turning blue.

570
00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.670
Police! Police!

571
00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:52.520
You will have to fill
these forms out.

572
00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:54.100
I don't know this man.

573
00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:56.060
Here, what do you need?
Can't get involved in this shit.

574
00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:58.360
Hey, I might have to detain you.
Detain me?

575
00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.860
The report's gotta
be filled out.

576
00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:01.570
She can do the reports.

577
00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:03.030
Ride with your wife.
We'll meet at the hospital.

578
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:05.070
The hospital? Two blocks away.

579
00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:06.530
She's not my wife.

580
00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:09.080
Let's go.

581
00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.290
This is insane.

582
00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:17.380
10 minutes ago, I'm about to
enjoy a quiet little dinner.

583
00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:19.500
I received this note...

584
00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:25.220
He's breathing, isn't he? Yes.

585
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:27.850
Is the siren entirely necessary?

586
00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:45.070
Let's just talk to someone who can
get this over with, shall we?

587
00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:46.450
Hang on.

588
00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:50.080
They need your driver's
license number.

589
00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:06.380
Oh, no. You've got
to be kidding.

590
00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:08.720
What is happening?

591
00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:11.100
This was what I was trying to
explain to you. This is a...

592
00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:12.560
A game.

593
00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:15.180
A what? It's a company.

594
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:17.650
They plan elaborate pranks.
Things like this.

595
00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:19.900
I don't really
understand it myself.

596
00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:23.780
What are you talking about?
This is a...

597
00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:26.950
The lights, they went out.
A hundred people ran away.

598
00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:32.290
What, so you mean the guy who just
pissed himself and turned blue was...

599
00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:34.000
Sorry about that.

600
00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.670
You should be.

601
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:42.960
Why're they involving you?

602
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:45.420
There's gotta be a...

603
00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:49.010
A flashlight.

604
00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:50.680
Oh, great.

605
00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:59.100
I thought that guy was going to die.
I gave him mouth-to-mouth.

606
00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:01.270
I'll see you around.

607
00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:05.610
How do you know that's the way?

608
00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:07.070
I don't.

609
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:22.550
Where did you all go, you
motherfucking frat boys?

610
00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:26.220
You'd better hide.

611
00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:47.860
Lobby?

612
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:36.080
My brother got me this gift
certificate to this company...

613
00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:39.540
Why, I got the key
out of this...

614
00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:41.790
Out of the mouth of this

615
00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:43.920
wooden clown.

616
00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:46.380
Never mind.

617
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:52.680
I can't take this.

618
00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:02.770
There's no signal.

619
00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:06.480
What is the going rate for a
trapped-in-elevator adventure?

620
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:10.280
Well, don't even think about it.

621
00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:12.110
Why not? Read what
the sign says.

622
00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:15.280
"Warning, do not attempt to
open if the elevator stops."

623
00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.660
"Use emergency..."

624
00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:17.830
Phone? "... phone."

625
00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:20.330
If there was one.
We'll wait for help, so...

626
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.920
Let's just wait for help.

627
00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:34.760
Okay, I'll give you a boost.

628
00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.310
You get up, you go first.

629
00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:38.470
This is not an attempt
to be gallant.

630
00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:40.640
If I don't lift you how are
you going to get up there?

631
00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:43.020
I don't know, you'll pull me up.

632
00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:45.110
It's easier my way.
Come on, step up.

633
00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:46.820
No. Oh, please.

634
00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:49.530
I'm not wearing any underwear.

635
00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:52.410
Okay. There I said it.

636
00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:58.790
Okay.

637
00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:16.850
We can use this like a ladder.

638
00:46:16.850 --> 00:46:18.470
My hero, let's go.

639
00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:23.400
I don't think so.

640
00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:27.360
Thank you.

641
00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:37.740
Damn it! My briefcase!

642
00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:42.960
I'll wait.

643
00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:45.830
Not as if anybody could open it.

644
00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:56.260
Wait a minute. This is CRS.

645
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:58.600
What's CRS? This is the company
I was telling you about.

646
00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:01.140
The one that gave me
the gift certificate.

647
00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.690
This is their building.

648
00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:13.700
We'll wait. We'll wait
for security to come

649
00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:15.490
and we'll just explain.

650
00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:18.410
They'll love that!
Explain for both of us!

651
00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:22.330
Wait!

652
00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:40.140
We don't wanna draw
any attention...

653
00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:41.890
Just out for a stroll. Run!

654
00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:49.230
We can't fit down there!

655
00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:57.990
Are you trying to ditch me? Hey!

656
00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:59.490
You're a grown man.
I'm not responsible for...

657
00:47:59.490 --> 00:48:01.330
I'm not the one who
started running.

658
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:03.710
Well I'm not the one
that started this...

659
00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:23.220
Get up there! I'm going!

660
00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:26.600
Here.

661
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:29.810
Climb.

662
00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:42.160
So, where's your modesty
around attack dogs?

663
00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:55.470
Hey! Shut up!
Stupid fucking dogs.

664
00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:02.260
Let me guess. I go first.

665
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:16.190
There goes a thousand dollars.

666
00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.030
Your shoes cost a
thousand dollars?

667
00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:19.950
That one did.

668
00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:27.830
Here. Come on.

669
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:30.750
Here you go. Okay.

670
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:33.880
Watch out for nails

671
00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:34.880
and rats.

672
00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:36.380
What?

673
00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:38.760
There should be a fire escape.

674
00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.370
Yeah, it's classic.

675
00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:04.120
Why me?

676
00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:09.710
Who are you?

677
00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:12.710
Nicholas Van Orton.

678
00:50:13.290 --> 00:50:15.800
What are you, a
czar or something?

679
00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:18.130
All right.

680
00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.300
I think

681
00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:21.840
if we

682
00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:23.600
drop from here,

683
00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:25.810
the garbage will break our fall.

684
00:50:25.810 --> 00:50:28.940
I think not. Be careful!

685
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:36.230
What the fuck are
you looking at?

686
00:50:36.610 --> 00:50:37.610
Oh...

687
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:39.240
Shit.

688
00:51:04.890 --> 00:51:06.770
Table for two, please.

689
00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:14.310
Where're we going?

690
00:51:14.310 --> 00:51:16.020
That tall bright building.

691
00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:17.860
It's right near there.

692
00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.200
Everything okay, miss?

693
00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:26.990
Yeah.

694
00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:28.910
How are you doing?

695
00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:31.670
San Francisco's finest.

696
00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:45.430
Is there some place
I could throw this?

697
00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:49.180
There's a wastebasket
beside the desk.

698
00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:51.230
Oh.

699
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:54.310
Think I have a fresh
sweatshirt for you somewhere.

700
00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:57.360
That would be great.

701
00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:04.570
You know, you've never
even asked me my name.

702
00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:07.790
The maitre d' said your
name was Christine.

703
00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:09.830
Oh, right.

704
00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:13.420
I guess I'll call you a cab.

705
00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:19.550
You got a shower in your office?

706
00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:20.800
Yeah.

707
00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:22.930
You an athlete or something?

708
00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:25.930
No, I'm an investment banker.

709
00:52:25.930 --> 00:52:29.390
I move money from one
place to another.

710
00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:36.730
Actually, would you mind if
I just quickly rinsed off?

711
00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:39.070
No.

712
00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:42.900
Is there a towel I could use?

713
00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:45.320
Yeah, it's behind the door.

714
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:48.620
Oh, I'll just be a second.
No problem.

715
00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:54.580
Listen, I know the owner of the
City Club and I'd be happy

716
00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:57.040
to give him a call
if you'd like.

717
00:52:57.290 --> 00:53:00.260
Don't, it was a shitty job anyway.
I overreacted.

718
00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:02.590
I, uh...

719
00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:06.260
I have a confession to make.

720
00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:12.680
Someone gave me 400 bucks to spill
drinks on you as a practical joke.

721
00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:14.060
Really?

722
00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:15.440
And what did they say?

723
00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:17.150
Well they said 300. I said 4.

724
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:20.940
They said, "The guy in the gray flannel
suit. "I think I said, "The, uh,

725
00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:23.950
"attractive guy in the
gray flannel suit?"

726
00:53:49.050 --> 00:53:51.720
Mr. Van Orton. I was afraid you
weren't going to make it back.

727
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:54.270
Thank you.

728
00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:03.150
Hello. Mr.
Van Orton, it's Maria.

729
00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:04.440
I thought I should call.

730
00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:05.610
What time is it?

731
00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:07.280
It's 11:00.

732
00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:10.160
I took the liberty of rescheduling
your meeting with Alison and...

733
00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:12.790
No, no, no. I'll be
in there in an hour.

734
00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:17.420
Can you... I left my briefcase
at 1010 Montgomery Street.

735
00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:19.710
Could you check with
Lost and Found, please?

736
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:22.170
Anson Baer's in town at
the Ritz Carlton. Really?

737
00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:23.510
He's requesting dinner tonight.

738
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:25.220
Well, we'll see about that.

739
00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:27.300
And the Hotel Nikko
called to say

740
00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:30.180
they have your American Express
card at the front desk.

741
00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:32.520
You left it there last night?

742
00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:35.520
Should I send someone? No,
just give me the number.

743
00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:38.150
555-1111. I'll call you back.

744
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:44.360
Good morning, Hotel Nikko.

745
00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:47.820
Yes, this is Nicholas Van Orton.
I'm told you have my American Express card.

746
00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:49.950
Yes, Mr. Van Orton
everything's in order.

747
00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:52.450
The concierges has arranged for
the wine and flowers in the room.

748
00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:54.790
Has he? And a young woman phoned

749
00:54:54.790 --> 00:54:57.660
to say she's on route but
running a little late.

750
00:54:57.670 --> 00:55:00.040
Did the young woman
leave her name?

751
00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:03.210
I'm sure I don't know.

752
00:55:03.210 --> 00:55:05.050
Of course you don't. Thank you.

753
00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:17.940
Sorry, my fault.

754
00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:26.740
Ah, Mr. Van Orton.

755
00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:28.110
Welcome back.

756
00:55:28.610 --> 00:55:29.990
Here we go.

757
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:33.240
Have we met?

758
00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:35.790
I believe so.

759
00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:42.880
If you'll just sign here
on the signature card.

760
00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:51.680
Thank you.

761
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:57.730
My key?

762
00:55:58.600 --> 00:55:59.600
Huh?

763
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:01.810
Don't I get a key?

764
00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:05.440
Didn't I give you
one last night?

765
00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:07.150
No, I don't think so.

766
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:12.780
Cute, that's very cute.

767
00:56:13.450 --> 00:56:14.830
This way, sir.

768
00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:16.580
Have a nice day.

769
00:57:57.890 --> 00:57:59.640
Housekeeping.

770
00:58:07.610 --> 00:58:09.990
Could you come back
a little later?

771
00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:36.260
Ah!

772
00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:37.810
Shit.

773
00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:13.340
Thank you, sir.

774
01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:26.920
Where the fuck is he?

775
01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:30.000
Jesus! Why are you following me?

776
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.380
What are you talking about?

777
01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:33.840
I'm not following you.
I'm just driving it.

778
01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:34.960
Hey,

779
01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:37.970
whatever I'm doing is none of your
business. Is Anson Baer the game?

780
01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:39.550
Is that what this is all about?

781
01:00:39.550 --> 01:00:42.350
Look buddy, back off.
Just back off, huh?

782
01:00:42.350 --> 01:00:43.470
What!

783
01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:46.640
Oh, that's cute.
That's really cute.

784
01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:49.400
I suppose the game uses
real bullets, huh?

785
01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.950
All right. I'm a
private investigator.

786
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:59.360
Somebody hired me to
keep tabs on you. Who?

787
01:00:59.370 --> 01:01:01.370
Who hired you? Who hired you?

788
01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:13.630
Mr. Van Orton... Maria,
get hold of Sutherland.

789
01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:16.550
Have him meet me at the Ritz Carlton.
I'm on my way.

790
01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:30.860
What's happening?
Follow me, Sam.

791
01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:39.780
Ah, Nicholas!

792
01:01:40.070 --> 01:01:41.490
It's unexpected.

793
01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:48.120
Now, do you really believe

794
01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:50.880
that just because you
publish children's books

795
01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:53.040
people are gonna care
about my reputation?

796
01:01:53.050 --> 01:01:54.800
You can have pictures of me

797
01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.760
wearing nipple rings,
butt-fucking Captain Kangaroo.

798
01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:00.180
The only thing they care
about is the stock!

799
01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:02.640
And whether that
stock is up or down.

800
01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:03.850
Daddy? It's all right, dear.
It's all right.

801
01:02:03.850 --> 01:02:08.190
And the fact that you bring
Conrad into this juvenile game

802
01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.440
is unconscionable.

803
01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:14.480
Are you finished? No!
I'm not finished!

804
01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.610
I'd like you to meet my
attorney, Samuel Sutherland.

805
01:02:17.650 --> 01:02:20.150
I think the two of you have
got something to talk about.

806
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.320
Oh, we met this morning.

807
01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:25.450
I signed the termination
contract for Baer-Grant.

808
01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:28.040
I accepted your
settlement, Nicholas.

809
01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:32.250
You were right. I'm going sailing.
You know, sailing.

810
01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:38.670
You're welcome to join our lunch.
Maybe we can straighten this out.

811
01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:43.680
You remember my wife, Mary Carol,
and my daughter-in-law, Kaleigh.

812
01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:52.770
Please

813
01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:55.360
accept my

814
01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:58.570
misguided, uh...

815
01:03:11.170 --> 01:03:13.000
How concerned should I be?

816
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.880
It was a misunderstanding.

817
01:03:16.550 --> 01:03:18.380
It looks a lot like you.

818
01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:22.550
Well, you should see what they
do with the nightly news.

819
01:03:22.550 --> 01:03:23.640
What?

820
01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:25.470
Can I ask you to do me a favor?

821
01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:26.970
You know you can.

822
01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:31.020
Find out about a company called
Consumer Recreation Services.

823
01:03:32.310 --> 01:03:34.400
Sounds like they
make tennis rackets.

824
01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:36.110
What do you know?

825
01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:40.030
Wait a minute.
They gave me a waiver.

826
01:03:55.090 --> 01:03:57.420
What is this? It's a...

827
01:03:59.590 --> 01:04:00.590
What's...

828
01:04:01.970 --> 01:04:05.220
I don't believe it.
It's invisible ink.

829
01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:08.310
You're joking. This is what I'm
dealing with. I'm being toyed with

830
01:04:08.310 --> 01:04:10.980
by a bunch of depraved children.
This...

831
01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.810
Are you okay?

832
01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:17.610
Tell me not to worry.

833
01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:21.650
You don't have to worry.

834
01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:23.320
I promise.

835
01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:24.610
Okay.

836
01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:28.700
I'll call you later.

837
01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:31.410
Right. Okay, bye.

838
01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:37.250
Maria, the other
night, last night

839
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.300
I got a taxi for a young
woman named Christine.

840
01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:41.800
What's the company that we use?

841
01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:43.630
United? What?

842
01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:45.760
United Taxi Company.
United Taxi Company.

843
01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:48.890
Call United, find out
who the driver was

844
01:04:48.890 --> 01:04:51.060
and where they took her.

845
01:05:19.170 --> 01:05:20.420
Ilsa!

846
01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:23.300
Oh, shit!

847
01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:56.370
I have a gun!

848
01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:12.700
You fuckers.

849
01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:18.580
Ilsa.

850
01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:20.580
Ilsa. Ilsa.

851
01:07:20.590 --> 01:07:22.090
Mr. Van Orton!
Are you all right?

852
01:07:22.090 --> 01:07:23.090
What do you mean?
What's happened?

853
01:07:23.090 --> 01:07:24.480
The house, you haven't
seen the house?

854
01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:25.760
What's wrong?

855
01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:27.220
There's been a break in.
Now, lock your door.

856
01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:29.640
Stay inside, just lock your door.
Oh, be careful.

857
01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:38.810
911 emergency. Yes,
I need the police.

858
01:07:38.810 --> 01:07:40.440
There's been a break
in to my house.

859
01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:42.650
Just stay on the line and
give me your address.

860
01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:44.980
My address is 2210 Broadway.

861
01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:46.990
It's the biggest
house on the street.

862
01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:48.490
Now sir, you said
it was a break in?

863
01:07:48.490 --> 01:07:50.320
Yes. Yes, there's
been a break in.

864
01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.280
Are you sure they're gone?

865
01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:53.790
What?

866
01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:57.250
Are you sure there's not still
someone somewhere in the house?

867
01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:00.170
Nickie!

868
01:08:00.170 --> 01:08:01.750
Hello, sir? Are you still there?

869
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:03.630
Meet me at your car. Hello?

870
01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:05.960
Sir?

871
01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:16.730
All right. What happened? Shh!

872
01:08:17.850 --> 01:08:20.190
Conrad, where're we going?
Just wait!

873
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:26.740
What are you doing?

874
01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:27.900
They're methodical.

875
01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:30.030
If I can't trust the room
service in the hotel,

876
01:08:30.030 --> 01:08:31.530
I sure as hell can't
trust a fucking car.

877
01:08:31.530 --> 01:08:33.700
Who? CRS. Who do you think!

878
01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.140
Jesus! When I think what
I almost got you into...

879
01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:37.660
What are you saying?

880
01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:39.040
Oh, I'm so fucked.

881
01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:42.380
They just fuck you and they
fuck you and they fuck you!

882
01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:45.500
And just when you think it's all over
that's when the real fucking starts!

883
01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:48.130
All right, calm down.
Just take a breath.

884
01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:52.890
They won't stop, Nick.

885
01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:56.350
I paid the bill. I gave
them their fucking money.

886
01:08:56.350 --> 01:08:57.890
They won't leave me alone!

887
01:08:57.890 --> 01:08:59.060
What're they doing to you?

888
01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:01.400
Everything! I'm a
goddamned human piÃ±ata.

889
01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:02.480
Calm down!

890
01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:05.150
And why do they keep playing if
you've already paid? I don't know.

891
01:09:05.570 --> 01:09:08.070
I don't know. I paid them
more to make it stop!

892
01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:21.790
They did this.

893
01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:23.120
It's a flat tire.

894
01:09:23.130 --> 01:09:24.210
How do you know?

895
01:09:24.210 --> 01:09:26.380
Get a grip on yourself, will you?
We'll figure it out!

896
01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:27.840
Okay, okay.

897
01:09:38.810 --> 01:09:41.140
The phone doesn't work.
I can't get a signal. Really?

898
01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:43.690
You know how to change a tire?

899
01:09:43.690 --> 01:09:44.730
No, don't you?

900
01:09:45.270 --> 01:09:48.440
It can't be that hard. I don't think we
should be out in the open like this.

901
01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:51.400
Hit the Teletrack.
It's in the glove compartment.

902
01:10:11.010 --> 01:10:12.590
You're with them.

903
01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:14.970
What?

904
01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:17.600
You're doing this.
You're part of it.

905
01:10:20.230 --> 01:10:21.810
Whose are these?

906
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:25.600
I don't know about those.
Somebody put them in the car.

907
01:10:25.610 --> 01:10:27.400
You're behind the whole
thing, aren't you?

908
01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.650
What are you talking about?
You brought them to me.

909
01:10:29.650 --> 01:10:31.440
These were in your car!

910
01:10:31.450 --> 01:10:34.450
They're right there
in your fucking car!

911
01:10:34.450 --> 01:10:35.660
Conrad!

912
01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.580
Listen to what you're saying.

913
01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:44.960
No! You're not gonna
control this conversation.

914
01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:46.830
Why would I ever do
what you're describing?

915
01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:49.130
Because you resent me.
Stop being emotional.

916
01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:51.510
It kills you that
I'm living my life.

917
01:10:51.550 --> 01:10:52.800
Lower your voice, Conrad!

918
01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:55.380
What? You're afraid somebody's
gonna witness the scene?

919
01:10:55.390 --> 01:10:57.050
Get back in your...
Get back in your fucking house!

920
01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:58.890
Will you stop it?
I'm calling the cops.

921
01:10:58.890 --> 01:11:00.560
You're just so afraid
that somebody's gonna see

922
01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:03.230
what a manipulative fucking
control freak you are!

923
01:11:03.230 --> 01:11:04.520
What is wrong with you?
What are you on?

924
01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:06.190
Oh, I'm sorry, Nick.

925
01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:08.650
I'm sorry I didn't live
up to your expectations.

926
01:11:08.650 --> 01:11:09.730
Ah, bullshit!

927
01:11:09.730 --> 01:11:12.190
I'm not you. I'll never be you.
I don't wanna be you.

928
01:11:12.190 --> 01:11:13.240
There you go again!

929
01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:14.400
I'm your brother!

930
01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:16.360
Always pushing the
responsibility out on me.

931
01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:18.070
For Christ's sakes,
I'm your brother!

932
01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:19.740
All I ever tried to
do was help you.

933
01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:21.120
I don't want your help!

934
01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.040
Nobody asked you to play dad!

935
01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:24.710
No! You don't say that.

936
01:11:24.710 --> 01:11:28.000
Did I have a choice?

937
01:11:34.090 --> 01:11:35.090
Jackass!

938
01:11:47.690 --> 01:11:48.900
Conrad!

939
01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:23.390
What?

940
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:25.100
I don't want your help!

941
01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:26.100
Nobody asked you to play dad!

942
01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:28.730
Did I have a choice?
Did I have a choice?

943
01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:50.170
Taxi!

944
01:12:56.170 --> 01:12:57.510
2210 Broadway.

945
01:13:24.370 --> 01:13:26.460
Hey buddy, you missed the turn.

946
01:13:28.170 --> 01:13:30.130
Hey! Did you hear me?

947
01:13:31.210 --> 01:13:33.130
You missed the turn back...

948
01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:37.380
No, no, no. Stop the car!

949
01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:38.880
Stop the car!

950
01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:44.640
Thank you.

951
01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:46.680
Open the door.

952
01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:47.770
Unlock the door.

953
01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:50.310
Open, the goddamn door!

954
01:13:58.360 --> 01:13:59.490
Listen.

955
01:13:59.490 --> 01:14:02.580
I am a very wealthy man.

956
01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:05.660
And whatever they're paying you

957
01:14:06.370 --> 01:14:07.460
I'll double it.

958
01:14:11.250 --> 01:14:12.630
Oh, Jesus Christ!

959
01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:34.980
What!

960
01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:37.070
No!

961
01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:00.550
What, are you out of
your fucking mind?

962
01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:20.240
It's a game.

963
01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:04.570
Here they are.

964
01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:10.330
Detective, I'm Sam Sutherland.

965
01:16:10.330 --> 01:16:12.040
Tim Foley.

966
01:16:13.170 --> 01:16:14.540
You know where we're going?

967
01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:15.960
It's this way.

968
01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:17.300
14th floor.

969
01:16:36.650 --> 01:16:37.730
Okay.

970
01:16:37.730 --> 01:16:41.610
Management for the building says this
space hasn't been officially rented yet.

971
01:16:41.610 --> 01:16:45.030
The county recorder has no
listing for a Consumer.

972
01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:48.080
Recreation Service or
any derivation thereof.

973
01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:50.370
The divers, they're still
looking for the cab.

974
01:16:50.370 --> 01:16:53.120
As soon as they find it they'll
pull the plates and the VIN.

975
01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:54.460
Have you spoken to your brother?

976
01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:57.040
He hasn't called me back yet.
No.

977
01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:58.670
What about the house?

978
01:16:58.670 --> 01:17:02.050
The graffiti was an oil-based
marine marking solution,

979
01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:03.340
illegal in the States.

980
01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:06.140
It's not impossible to
trace but it'll take time.

981
01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:08.010
The photo, the gun,

982
01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:10.350
the clown, the ambulance.

983
01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:13.270
It's all pending.

984
01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:15.310
Breaking and entering
we've got solid.

985
01:17:15.690 --> 01:17:19.230
Malicious mischief, vandalism, harassment.
But that's all.

986
01:17:19.230 --> 01:17:21.690
Illegal surveillance.
Reckless endangerment.

987
01:17:21.690 --> 01:17:22.860
Attempted murder.

988
01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:27.070
Except you said you
hired these guys.

989
01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:29.080
That's irrelevant. Now, look.

990
01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:31.660
It's our job to tell
you what we've got.

991
01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:34.000
So far, we don't have motive.

992
01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:46.010
What was my father like, Ilsa?

993
01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:47.720
Why do you ask?

994
01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:49.810
I don't know.

995
01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:54.140
All the time I've known you you've
never once asked about him.

996
01:17:57.230 --> 01:17:59.440
I guess he was just on my mind.

997
01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:02.280
Your mother loved your
father very much.

998
01:18:02.490 --> 01:18:04.740
I think he just worked too hard.

999
01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.910
Was he, uh,

1000
01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:09.700
morose? I mean...

1001
01:18:10.450 --> 01:18:12.160
What I remember most

1002
01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.160
was that his manner was so

1003
01:18:14.710 --> 01:18:15.870
slight.

1004
01:18:16.710 --> 01:18:19.130
You could spend time in a room

1005
01:18:19.130 --> 01:18:21.380
and not even know that he'd
been there the whole time.

1006
01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:23.380
No, what I mean is,

1007
01:18:24.510 --> 01:18:25.880
before he...

1008
01:18:26.010 --> 01:18:27.340
What happened? No.

1009
01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.550
Nobody expected it.

1010
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:32.970
I wonder how much of
him there is in me.

1011
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:35.940
Not much, I think.

1012
01:18:39.190 --> 01:18:41.270
Was Mother worried about him?

1013
01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:44.320
Nobody ever worried
about your father.

1014
01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:50.240
Yes.

1015
01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:52.620
It's Maria. I found the address
you wanted from United Taxi.

1016
01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:53.950
Yeah, give it to me.

1017
01:18:53.950 --> 01:18:55.410
It's on Potrero Hill...

1018
01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:58.020
Who are you?

1019
01:19:59.730 --> 01:20:01.560
Christine, is she here?

1020
01:20:02.190 --> 01:20:03.320
She's sleeping.

1021
01:20:03.650 --> 01:20:05.570
Amy, who is it?

1022
01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:09.570
Hey! What're you doing here?

1023
01:20:09.570 --> 01:20:10.870
Can we talk?

1024
01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:12.910
Sure.

1025
01:20:17.330 --> 01:20:18.620
Hi. Hi.

1026
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:24.420
Didn't think I'd
ever see you again.

1027
01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:27.050
What can you tell
me about these?

1028
01:20:27.670 --> 01:20:29.090
Is this you?

1029
01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:31.930
Where did you get them?

1030
01:20:31.930 --> 01:20:33.430
My hotel room.

1031
01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:37.390
Was in my hotel room. Are you
telling me that this is not you?

1032
01:20:38.890 --> 01:20:40.850
What makes you, um...

1033
01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:44.610
Think this is me? Well, the...

1034
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:46.900
The bra. The red bra.

1035
01:20:47.610 --> 01:20:48.820
Okay.

1036
01:20:49.610 --> 01:20:51.450
Well, I thought that...

1037
01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:57.870
Can I sit down for a minute?

1038
01:20:58.120 --> 01:20:59.370
Sure.

1039
01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:02.000
Are you all right?

1040
01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:06.250
You're not all right, are you?

1041
01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:10.090
Is it this contest thing
that you're in still or...

1042
01:21:11.970 --> 01:21:13.890
I'm sorry, I am being a nuisance.
I should go.

1043
01:21:13.890 --> 01:21:17.470
No, it's okay. We can talk. I'll put
some clothes on. I'll be right back.

1044
01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:26.020
Do you have an aspirin?

1045
01:23:16.890 --> 01:23:19.010
Can I get you something
to drink with this?

1046
01:23:19.010 --> 01:23:20.350
Is this you?

1047
01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:23.440
Oh, yeah.
That's first communion.

1048
01:23:25.150 --> 01:23:26.560
Show it to me.

1049
01:23:27.150 --> 01:23:30.400
What's wrong? Take the
picture out of the frame

1050
01:23:30.780 --> 01:23:32.280
and show it to me.

1051
01:23:32.940 --> 01:23:34.200
All right.

1052
01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:37.910
They're watching.

1053
01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:40.330
What? Not here.

1054
01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:42.450
They can see here.

1055
01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:45.250
Smoke detector.

1056
01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:51.170
What do you say, uh...

1057
01:23:52.010 --> 01:23:54.220
Let's go for a drive or something.
We could...

1058
01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:58.550
No, no, no. I am tired of this.
I am goddamn tired of this.

1059
01:23:58.550 --> 01:24:00.140
We'll go for a drink.
There's a...

1060
01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:01.720
Who do you people think you are?

1061
01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:04.810
Who do you think you are?
Come on out of there!

1062
01:24:04.810 --> 01:24:06.560
Nicholas, please.
Let's go, right now.

1063
01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:08.940
Come on. Just, come on
out of there right now!

1064
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:18.660
Now you've done it.

1065
01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:39.010
So, what are they going to do?

1066
01:24:39.010 --> 01:24:40.760
Get away from the window.

1067
01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:11.460
What the...

1068
01:25:20.470 --> 01:25:21.600
What is this?

1069
01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:23.430
Wake up, it's a fucking con.

1070
01:26:04.890 --> 01:26:06.600
Get in, get in!

1071
01:26:28.710 --> 01:26:30.620
You all right? Hold on.

1072
01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:54.480
Get out of the car.

1073
01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:56.270
I could've handed you to them.
And they find me now they...

1074
01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:58.440
Get out of the goddamn car!

1075
01:26:58.440 --> 01:26:59.570
You don't have a choice!

1076
01:26:59.570 --> 01:27:02.160
No one else's gonna tell
you what's going on!

1077
01:27:18.130 --> 01:27:20.720
You wanna know? 'Cause if
I'm gone you never will.

1078
01:27:34.110 --> 01:27:37.900
I can't believe they didn't even take the
time to get the fucking house right.

1079
01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:39.030
Who are they?

1080
01:27:39.030 --> 01:27:40.820
I don't know. Nobody does.
I'm an employee.

1081
01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:42.990
Then what good are you? I know
things like who you can trust

1082
01:27:42.990 --> 01:27:44.990
and that your brother was in it
from beginning... That's a lie.

1083
01:27:44.990 --> 01:27:46.370
Yeah? I was your waitress
on your birthday.

1084
01:27:46.370 --> 01:27:49.790
Connie told you about CRS that day.
Ever seen me in there before?

1085
01:27:50.830 --> 01:27:52.170
Sorry.

1086
01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:56.000
I mean, it wasn't his fault. I guess
he thought it was his only way out.

1087
01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.460
They fleeced him real good.

1088
01:27:57.460 --> 01:27:59.130
How did they get to him?

1089
01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:01.050
Same thing to him
they did to you.

1090
01:28:01.050 --> 01:28:02.800
What are you talking about?

1091
01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:04.680
Have you checked your accounts?

1092
01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:08.100
That night in your office I got the
number to your private line and modem

1093
01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:10.930
that gave CRS remote
access to your computer.

1094
01:28:11.230 --> 01:28:13.060
You gave them everything else.

1095
01:28:13.230 --> 01:28:14.270
What?

1096
01:28:14.270 --> 01:28:16.650
You took their tests, handwriting,
voice samples, psych info.

1097
01:28:16.650 --> 01:28:19.440
They used it all to figure
out your passwords.

1098
01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:23.450
And Feingold, the guy
who signed you up,

1099
01:28:23.450 --> 01:28:25.820
he did 5 years for
hacking Citibank.

1100
01:28:26.530 --> 01:28:27.870
They only had to
keep you distracted

1101
01:28:27.870 --> 01:28:29.410
while they broke into
your financial network,

1102
01:28:29.410 --> 01:28:31.250
transferred your holdings
into dummy accounts...

1103
01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:33.210
Overseas operator, please.

1104
01:28:34.210 --> 01:28:35.710
Why else were they
willing to shoot at us?

1105
01:28:35.710 --> 01:28:37.920
Alamein Bank, Zurich,
Switzerland.

1106
01:28:39.130 --> 01:28:41.260
Because they're
finished with you.

1107
01:28:43.260 --> 01:28:44.840
Live or dead's the same.

1108
01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:47.560
Long as you disappear.

1109
01:28:50.850 --> 01:28:53.180
Yeah. Can I have
your code, please?

1110
01:28:53.190 --> 01:28:58.730
Yes. Blue-two-backslash-0-6-0-0.

1111
01:28:58.730 --> 01:29:00.440
"D" as in David.

1112
01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:03.320
That's right.

1113
01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:05.030
The balance?

1114
01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:10.580
That's impossible.

1115
01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:12.290
They already got it, Nicholas.

1116
01:29:13.370 --> 01:29:15.000
They got everything.

1117
01:29:21.630 --> 01:29:24.720
You've reached the Sutherlands.
Please leave a message.

1118
01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:28.180
As you get this message, Sam, I have
checked them all. I don't know how,

1119
01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:31.350
but they have drained
my accounts.

1120
01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:36.980
They're trying to kill me. Now you call
the cops. I got one of them right here.

1121
01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:38.650
We'll make her testify.

1122
01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:41.480
I know how this sounds,

1123
01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:42.650
but you call me

1124
01:29:42.820 --> 01:29:44.450
on my cellular.

1125
01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:46.490
And you be careful.

1126
01:29:47.490 --> 01:29:48.700
They...

1127
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:50.790
They cut your card in half so...

1128
01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:53.620
My treat.

1129
01:30:32.370 --> 01:30:34.500
You take two sugars, right?

1130
01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:37.080
Never mind.

1131
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:46.380
My name's not Christine. It's...
I mean, it's not my real name.

1132
01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:48.010
Who fucking cares?

1133
01:30:49.220 --> 01:30:52.520
It is just money. You should
be glad you're alive.

1134
01:30:52.810 --> 01:30:55.310
I'd rather not talk
about it right now.

1135
01:30:56.810 --> 01:30:58.190
All I mean is
someone like you...

1136
01:30:58.190 --> 01:31:00.110
How many times have
you done this?

1137
01:31:00.110 --> 01:31:01.360
I'm curious. What?

1138
01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:03.650
These scams.
Con games, how many?

1139
01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:05.900
Lots.

1140
01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:09.110
But, whatever nickel-dime
bullshit you pulled in the past,

1141
01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:11.330
this is more than just me.

1142
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:13.790
This is pension plans,

1143
01:31:13.790 --> 01:31:15.080
payrolls.

1144
01:31:15.410 --> 01:31:17.670
This is $600 million.

1145
01:31:31.100 --> 01:31:32.220
Yes.

1146
01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:34.390
Nick, it's Sam.
I got your message.

1147
01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:36.680
I was disturbed
to say the least.

1148
01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:37.890
So, what are we gonna do?

1149
01:31:37.890 --> 01:31:40.100
I've been on the phone
for an hour already.

1150
01:31:40.100 --> 01:31:42.730
Nicholas, your funds are intact.

1151
01:31:43.530 --> 01:31:45.530
Nothing's been touched.

1152
01:31:45.530 --> 01:31:47.950
What are you talking about?
I checked on them myself.

1153
01:31:47.950 --> 01:31:49.860
Who is it? I made the calls.

1154
01:31:49.860 --> 01:31:51.530
Nothing's changed.

1155
01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:54.740
I'm telling you. Not one
cent is unaccounted for.

1156
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:56.040
Who is it?

1157
01:31:56.290 --> 01:31:59.040
My attorney says that
nothing is missing.

1158
01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:00.960
He's in on it.

1159
01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:03.840
I don't know what the hell is
happening, but stay where you are

1160
01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:06.170
until I get there.
Sutherland's in on it.

1161
01:32:06.170 --> 01:32:08.130
Nicholas, I have another call.

1162
01:32:08.130 --> 01:32:10.260
Give me your precise location.

1163
01:32:11.090 --> 01:32:12.300
Nicholas?

1164
01:32:16.270 --> 01:32:18.270
We've got to get out of here.

1165
01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:26.400
How did they get to him?

1166
01:32:27.070 --> 01:32:28.450
Why did...

1167
01:32:31.070 --> 01:32:33.080
I wouldn't worry about it.

1168
01:32:38.790 --> 01:32:40.370
What do you mean?

1169
01:32:41.170 --> 01:32:43.040
It's out of your hands.

1170
01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:08.360
Cellular calls can
be intercepted.

1171
01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:12.990
Those calls you made
to B of A, France.

1172
01:33:12.990 --> 01:33:16.660
B of A, France, Switzerland,
you were talking to us.

1173
01:33:16.990 --> 01:33:18.370
You were talking to us.

1174
01:33:18.370 --> 01:33:20.460
Filled in the blanks.
Access codes,

1175
01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:22.710
passwords, access
codes, passwords...

1176
01:33:22.710 --> 01:33:26.800
Stuff even your lawyer didn't have.
Stuff even your lawyer didn't have.

1177
01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:28.970
We have it now so we're done.

1178
01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:44.020
Bye, Nicholas.

1179
01:36:09.130 --> 01:36:10.630
Things have happened

1180
01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:13.720
and it's important that...
Shh, shh, shh!

1181
01:36:15.970 --> 01:36:19.550
No money, no identification,
no passport.

1182
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:23.850
What happened to you?

1183
01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:25.730
Where to begin...

1184
01:36:28.230 --> 01:36:29.310
It's complicated.

1185
01:36:29.310 --> 01:36:30.690
It always is.

1186
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:38.030
I was on holiday alone

1187
01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:41.410
and I was robbed by two men.
Robbed?

1188
01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:45.450
And what hotel were
you staying at?

1189
01:36:45.460 --> 01:36:47.790
I... I don't remember. I...

1190
01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:51.920
Have you gone to the police?

1191
01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:55.010
I don't speak Spanish.

1192
01:36:57.470 --> 01:37:00.180
And I just need enough
to get out of here.

1193
01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:03.890
Oh, we'll help with the local law
enforcement if you wanted to bother.

1194
01:37:03.890 --> 01:37:07.350
As far as money is concerned,
can I make a suggestion?

1195
01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:10.440
You say you were mugged?

1196
01:37:11.110 --> 01:37:13.360
And they didn't take that watch?

1197
01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:17.990
How much is a watch
like that worth?

1198
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:20.200
A couple of hundred at least.

1199
01:37:23.870 --> 01:37:28.120
Man with a watch like that doesn't
necessarily have a passport problem.

1200
01:38:53.170 --> 01:38:54.630
Excuse me?

1201
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:58.220
Can I have your
attention, please?

1202
01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:04.220
Thank you.

1203
01:39:05.390 --> 01:39:08.640
Anybody here going to San Francisco?
I need a ride.

1204
01:39:11.650 --> 01:39:14.360
I've got $18 and 70...

1205
01:39:14.730 --> 01:39:16.280
78 cents

1206
01:39:17.740 --> 01:39:19.820
for a ride to San Francisco.

1207
01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:26.950
Anybody?

1208
01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:16.400
Keep the change. Thanks, pal.

1209
01:41:20.190 --> 01:41:23.450
Conrad Van Orton. Could you
ring his room, please?

1210
01:41:24.150 --> 01:41:25.910
One moment, please.

1211
01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:31.700
Is there a problem?

1212
01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:33.750
You're here for Conrad Van Orton?
Yes.

1213
01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:37.460
I'm the hotel manager.
Pleasure to meet you. Where's my brother?

1214
01:41:38.420 --> 01:41:39.790
Will you come with me, sir?

1215
01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:41.760
Wait a minute, is there trouble?

1216
01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:45.470
Sir, this is a private
matter for you.

1217
01:41:57.150 --> 01:42:00.820
There was some complaints by other
guests, damage to his room.

1218
01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:03.400
We did the best we could to
accommodate his behavior.

1219
01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:04.690
His behavior? Yes, sir.

1220
01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:07.870
There was an incident
a few days ago.

1221
01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:11.370
A nervous breakdown, they said.

1222
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:13.750
The police took him.

1223
01:42:14.290 --> 01:42:16.540
They left this address
in case anyone came.

1224
01:42:17.250 --> 01:42:19.340
It's a hospital in Napa, sir.

1225
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:22.170
I'm terribly sorry.

1226
01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:42.230
Elizabeth, I need
to borrow your car.

1227
01:42:43.150 --> 01:42:44.280
Nickie,

1228
01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:47.360
what happened to you? I mean...

1229
01:42:48.370 --> 01:42:50.700
Look at you. Look at me.
What happened, I...

1230
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:53.240
I don't know. I... There're just
some things I have to do, all right?

1231
01:42:53.250 --> 01:42:54.500
I need your car.

1232
01:42:55.290 --> 01:42:57.870
Of course, you can have
it if you need it.

1233
01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:02.250
Can't I get you
something to eat?

1234
01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:05.300
You know that you're
the only person

1235
01:43:05.300 --> 01:43:06.800
that I can trust.

1236
01:43:08.550 --> 01:43:11.680
Everyone else is... If Sam
Sutherland calls you,

1237
01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:13.770
you don't tell him you talked to me.
You lie to him.

1238
01:43:13.810 --> 01:43:16.640
And whatever else happens
before he speaks...

1239
01:43:16.890 --> 01:43:18.520
Okay, coffee,

1240
01:43:18.810 --> 01:43:20.520
English muffin,

1241
01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:22.190
and your water.

1242
01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:24.530
This bottle

1243
01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:26.950
is open. Who opened this bottle?
Yeah, I opened it.

1244
01:43:26.990 --> 01:43:29.660
I don't want an opened bottle.
I want an unopened bottle.

1245
01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:33.040
I don't want ice in the glass.
I want just a glass,

1246
01:43:33.450 --> 01:43:34.790
please.

1247
01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:40.460
Nickie, talk to me.

1248
01:43:40.630 --> 01:43:42.210
You're scaring me.

1249
01:43:43.090 --> 01:43:44.800
I don't even know
what you're saying.

1250
01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:47.170
I'm sorry, Liz. I don't mean it.
I'm sorry.

1251
01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:53.890
You know, I've been thinking
the last couple of days.

1252
01:43:54.010 --> 01:43:56.600
I've had some spare time.

1253
01:44:00.150 --> 01:44:02.060
And I wanted to tell you that

1254
01:44:03.980 --> 01:44:06.360
I understand why you left me.

1255
01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:09.610
And I know that I resented it.

1256
01:44:14.950 --> 01:44:17.000
I want to apologize to you

1257
01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:20.250
for shutting you out

1258
01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:22.420
and not being there.

1259
01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:25.210
And I hope that you
can forgive me.

1260
01:44:25.210 --> 01:44:27.970
You're tired.
You've been on the go for days.

1261
01:44:27.970 --> 01:44:30.180
There's nothing to forgive.
Then,

1262
01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:31.680
pain sets in.

1263
01:44:32.260 --> 01:44:34.680
The onset of a
migraine headache.

1264
01:44:34.850 --> 01:44:38.600
If this sounds all too familiar,
relief is here at last.

1265
01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:41.190
Oh no, you bastards.

1266
01:44:41.190 --> 01:44:44.400
Taggarene. For nearly a decade,
doctors have been prescribing...

1267
01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:46.280
How did you find me here?

1268
01:44:47.940 --> 01:44:52.820
Taggarene is strong medicine for headaches,
toothaches, muscle fatigue, joint pains...

1269
01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:54.490
He's an actor.

1270
01:44:54.490 --> 01:44:57.500
So if you trust your
doctor, trust Taggarene.

1271
01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:01.120
He's an actor on television.

1272
01:45:03.630 --> 01:45:05.300
Can't explain now.

1273
01:45:06.050 --> 01:45:07.760
Can I borrow your Yellow Pages?

1274
01:45:31.450 --> 01:45:35.240
New Moon Cafe,
best in Chinatown.

1275
01:45:36.910 --> 01:45:38.750
Get out of the car, fucker.

1276
01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:40.710
Open the door and
leave it running.

1277
01:45:40.710 --> 01:45:41.790
You're making a mistake here.

1278
01:45:41.790 --> 01:45:45.210
Get the fuck out of the car.

1279
01:45:45.210 --> 01:45:47.920
I am extremely fragile

1280
01:45:48.510 --> 01:45:49.840
right now.

1281
01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:02.440
New Moon Cafe.

1282
01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:05.440
He does commercials. Do you know
how many customers we have?

1283
01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:06.730
Hundreds, thousands.

1284
01:46:06.730 --> 01:46:10.490
I know he ordered from you.
He went to Montgomery Street. 1010...

1285
01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:14.110
Is there anybody here
that can help me?

1286
01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:18.370
He's an actor. He's like one of these
people you have here up on your...

1287
01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:32.470
Hey! Why are you
taking my picture?

1288
01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:36.850
We were hoping he
could audition today.

1289
01:46:36.850 --> 01:46:39.140
He'd really be perfect
for this part.

1290
01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:41.350
Oh, this will break his heart.

1291
01:46:41.350 --> 01:46:44.100
Well is there any place
we can contact him?

1292
01:46:44.100 --> 01:46:46.650
Well, his beeper's
here on the table.

1293
01:46:46.650 --> 01:46:48.190
He took the kids to the zoo.

1294
01:46:48.190 --> 01:46:50.570
The zoo?
That's very, very sweet.

1295
01:46:50.570 --> 01:46:52.820
Which zoo? Oh, it's the
one with the white tiger.

1296
01:46:57.240 --> 01:46:59.660
Lionel Fisher, I love your work.

1297
01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:04.500
Okay, please. Look, I, uh...

1298
01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:06.380
I got my kids.

1299
01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:09.040
Get rid of them.

1300
01:47:09.050 --> 01:47:10.880
All right, guys, uh, guys.

1301
01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:13.880
Snack time. More snacks.
Here, go, go, go.

1302
01:47:15.590 --> 01:47:17.010
That's all. Uh...

1303
01:47:17.850 --> 01:47:20.390
It was just a job.
Nothing personal.

1304
01:47:20.850 --> 01:47:22.770
You know. I mean,
I play my part,

1305
01:47:22.770 --> 01:47:25.100
improvise a little. I mean,
it's what I'm good at...

1306
01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:27.900
I need to talk to
who's in charge.

1307
01:47:28.230 --> 01:47:29.570
Nobody knows.

1308
01:47:29.980 --> 01:47:31.940
I mean nobody gets
a big picture...

1309
01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:34.820
Hey, Tammy, Alex cut it out.
Damn it, why do they do that?

1310
01:47:34.820 --> 01:47:38.660
Your offices are empty. I need
to find out where they are.

1311
01:47:41.870 --> 01:47:43.040
Look,

1312
01:47:43.210 --> 01:47:45.580
they own the whole building.

1313
01:47:45.580 --> 01:47:47.580
They just move from
floor to floor.

1314
01:47:47.580 --> 01:47:49.000
And you work for them, right?

1315
01:47:49.250 --> 01:47:50.840
You can get me in.

1316
01:47:51.550 --> 01:47:53.550
No, I can't. Oh, yes, you can.

1317
01:47:53.590 --> 01:47:56.970
You can tell them the police called.
You got to speak to someone.

1318
01:47:56.970 --> 01:47:58.970
You tell them I'm gonna
blow the whistle on them.

1319
01:47:58.970 --> 01:48:01.220
What whistle?
There's no fucking whistle.

1320
01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:03.560
This is very dangerous.

1321
01:48:05.900 --> 01:48:07.860
I don't think that
you understand.

1322
01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:11.610
Right now

1323
01:48:12.570 --> 01:48:13.740
I am

1324
01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:14.990
extremely

1325
01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:16.490
dangerous.

1326
01:48:19.700 --> 01:48:22.870
Michael, guys.
Come on, we're leaving.

1327
01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:35.590
Well we're here.

1328
01:48:36.010 --> 01:48:37.300
Drive in.

1329
01:48:42.770 --> 01:48:44.930
What're you gonna do, anyway?

1330
01:48:45.180 --> 01:48:46.940
You won't get your money back.

1331
01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:50.690
I don't care about money.
I'm pulling back the curtain.

1332
01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:52.940
I wanna meet the wizard.

1333
01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:01.280
He's eyeing us like
Tiffany Towers.

1334
01:49:01.490 --> 01:49:04.080
Pull in somewhere where
they won't see you.

1335
01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:27.390
Shit. Stay down. Stay down.

1336
01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:35.190
You're not allowed to be here.

1337
01:49:35.190 --> 01:49:36.280
They called me back.

1338
01:49:36.530 --> 01:49:37.780
I got a fitting.

1339
01:49:38.700 --> 01:49:40.160
He's with me.

1340
01:49:43.410 --> 01:49:45.660
You don't need me. Shut up.

1341
01:49:46.540 --> 01:49:48.500
Get in. Oh, my God.

1342
01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:50.880
Cuff him to the rail.

1343
01:49:56.420 --> 01:49:57.800
What floor?

1344
01:50:16.780 --> 01:50:20.570
You're fucked, you both.
They're gonna miss me.

1345
01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:23.620
Where? I told you they
hired me over the phone...

1346
01:50:23.620 --> 01:50:24.870
Where did you pick
up your checks?

1347
01:50:24.870 --> 01:50:26.330
It was a different floor then.

1348
01:50:26.330 --> 01:50:29.330
Then guess. I... It went
on this way, sort of...

1349
01:50:29.330 --> 01:50:30.790
I don't know.

1350
01:50:34.130 --> 01:50:35.960
All right, take it easy.

1351
01:51:04.910 --> 01:51:06.910
It's gonna be a surprise.

1352
01:51:25.970 --> 01:51:27.890
Oh, fuck!

1353
01:51:29.890 --> 01:51:31.850
What are you doing here?

1354
01:51:32.690 --> 01:51:34.560
Back from the dead.

1355
01:51:44.370 --> 01:51:47.040
Nicholas, you're not
about to shoot anyone.

1356
01:51:47.620 --> 01:51:48.950
Turn around.

1357
01:51:57.170 --> 01:51:59.340
You're gonna come with me.

1358
01:51:59.630 --> 01:52:01.130
Everybody down!

1359
01:52:33.670 --> 01:52:35.080
Stop!

1360
01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:46.140
All right, what do you
think you're doing?

1361
01:52:46.140 --> 01:52:47.510
You tell me!

1362
01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:50.100
Who's behind this?

1363
01:52:50.100 --> 01:52:52.100
Who did this to me? Why?

1364
01:52:52.100 --> 01:52:55.520
What do you mean, "Why?" How deluded can
you be? Who is responsible for this?

1365
01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:57.690
It wasn't you.
It wasn't personal.

1366
01:52:57.690 --> 01:53:00.590
It could've been any asshole with a
couple of hundred million in the bank.

1367
01:53:00.610 --> 01:53:02.860
Get on that radio, all right?
You get your boss up here.

1368
01:53:02.860 --> 01:53:04.950
You tell them I'm
gonna shoot somebody.

1369
01:53:04.950 --> 01:53:06.620
Who am I gonna call, Nicholas?
They won't do it.

1370
01:53:06.620 --> 01:53:08.990
Oh, yes, they will.
You get somebody up here

1371
01:53:08.990 --> 01:53:11.250
because I'm gonna kill you.
They don't care about me, Nicholas.

1372
01:53:11.250 --> 01:53:14.500
They'll let me die. You're not in
a position to threaten anyone.

1373
01:53:14.710 --> 01:53:16.120
Wait a minute.
Where'd you get that?

1374
01:53:16.130 --> 01:53:17.170
What?

1375
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:20.500
That gun.
That's not an automatic.

1376
01:53:20.510 --> 01:53:22.170
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1377
01:53:22.170 --> 01:53:24.260
The guard had an automatic.
Where did you get the gun?

1378
01:53:24.260 --> 01:53:25.430
This is my gun.

1379
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:26.930
But we searched the house.

1380
01:53:27.180 --> 01:53:29.140
Well I guess you missed
this, didn't you?

1381
01:53:29.140 --> 01:53:32.390
There's a situation up here.
We got a real goddamn gun up here...

1382
01:53:33.100 --> 01:53:35.350
Nicholas, it's fake.
It's a part of your game.

1383
01:53:35.350 --> 01:53:37.150
Don't you start with me now.
No, no, listen to me.

1384
01:53:37.150 --> 01:53:39.060
Don't you fucking start with me.
I'm telling you the truth now.

1385
01:53:39.070 --> 01:53:40.480
This is all the game.

1386
01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:42.570
Bullshit, all right? Bullshit.
I know what happened to that guy.

1387
01:53:42.570 --> 01:53:44.950
They shot that guy, Feingold, Fisher,
they killed him. What did you see?

1388
01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:46.530
Think about it. What'd you see?
I saw them kill him.

1389
01:53:46.530 --> 01:53:49.620
No, what'd you really really
see, this whole time?

1390
01:53:49.620 --> 01:53:52.620
Special effects, squibs.
Squibs like in the movies.

1391
01:53:52.620 --> 01:53:54.410
Nicholas. Nicholas, listen.

1392
01:53:55.920 --> 01:53:57.750
I've got a real gun with
real goddamned bullets...

1393
01:53:57.750 --> 01:53:59.920
Okay, okay. I'll put it down.

1394
01:54:01.420 --> 01:54:04.760
Feingold, Mr. Fisher. He's on the other
side of that door. He's an actor.

1395
01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:06.720
You're trying to kill me. No one's
trying to kill you, Nicholas.

1396
01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:09.510
Please put that gun down. You're about to
make the biggest mistake of your life.

1397
01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:13.270
Nicholas, there was always a safety net.
The taxi, there was a diver. My house,

1398
01:54:13.270 --> 01:54:15.140
they shot at us with blanks.

1399
01:54:15.140 --> 01:54:16.230
It's not true.

1400
01:54:16.230 --> 01:54:18.100
It is. It's what
you hired us for.

1401
01:54:18.110 --> 01:54:20.770
They're waiting on the other side
of that door with champagne.

1402
01:54:20.770 --> 01:54:22.230
Nicholas.

1403
01:54:23.150 --> 01:54:26.490
Please, goddamn it! Conrad.
Conrad's there.

1404
01:54:26.490 --> 01:54:28.280
It's your birthday party.

1405
01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:29.830
You stop lying!

1406
01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:34.290
Let me show you.

1407
01:54:35.620 --> 01:54:37.500
Don't you move.

1408
01:54:38.420 --> 01:54:40.960
He's got a gun.
Get back from the door.

1409
01:54:55.270 --> 01:54:56.730
You shot him.

1410
01:55:04.150 --> 01:55:06.650
Someone...
Someone call an ambulance!

1411
01:55:27.380 --> 01:55:28.720
He's dead.

1412
01:55:33.970 --> 01:55:35.730
We thought you knew.

1413
01:55:39.850 --> 01:55:42.520
How did you let this
get so out of hand?

1414
01:55:43.690 --> 01:55:45.780
He wouldn't listen to me.

1415
01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:51.370
We went through
this over and over.

1416
01:55:55.830 --> 01:55:58.370
The mark is your responsibility.

1417
01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:00.170
You never,

1418
01:56:00.710 --> 01:56:03.210
never let the mark take over.

1419
01:56:05.550 --> 01:56:08.180
I'm sorry. He could
have almost killed us.

1420
01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:11.760
I had a walkie-talkie.

1421
01:56:12.100 --> 01:56:14.100
I used the walkie-talkie.

1422
01:56:16.770 --> 01:56:18.310
We're going to jail.

1423
01:56:18.310 --> 01:56:21.900
We're all going to jail for
the rest of our lives.

1424
01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:33.490
Oh, God.

1425
01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:36.250
Nicholas!

1426
01:57:11.490 --> 01:57:13.410
We've got him. He's in the bag.

1427
01:57:13.410 --> 01:57:15.950
We have him here.
He came in right on target.

1428
01:57:18.750 --> 01:57:22.170
Keep everyone back until we
clear away the breakaway glass.

1429
01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:25.750
Mr. Van Orton, don't
open your eyes.

1430
01:57:25.750 --> 01:57:28.760
It's just breakaway glass,
but it can still cut you.

1431
01:57:30.260 --> 01:57:32.010
Just gonna take a look at you.

1432
01:57:32.010 --> 01:57:33.890
I'm gonna check your pulse.

1433
01:57:38.850 --> 01:57:41.640
Just take it easy.
That was quite a fall.

1434
01:58:13.300 --> 01:58:15.180
Happy Birthday, Nickie.

1435
01:58:27.610 --> 01:58:29.360
What is this?

1436
01:58:30.110 --> 01:58:32.110
It's your birthday present.

1437
01:58:52.090 --> 01:58:55.260
I had to do something.
You were becoming such an asshole.

1438
01:59:06.900 --> 01:59:09.690
Ladies and gentlemen.
My brother, Nicholas Van Orton.

1439
01:59:45.020 --> 01:59:49.110
Amazing. I just wanted to tell you.
Great job.

1440
01:59:49.110 --> 01:59:51.110
This was the best ever.

1441
01:59:52.820 --> 01:59:54.950
Thank God you jumped.
Because if you didn't,

1442
01:59:54.950 --> 01:59:56.700
I was supposed to throw you off.

1443
01:59:56.700 --> 01:59:58.030
Thanks.

1444
01:59:59.120 --> 02:00:02.330
We have to head home.
We just wanted to say goodbye.

1445
02:00:02.750 --> 02:00:04.120
Rachel.

1446
02:00:04.500 --> 02:00:05.960
Sweet dreams.

1447
02:00:08.170 --> 02:00:12.210
Thanks, Mel, for coming.
I'm sorry about your car. I...

1448
02:00:12.210 --> 02:00:14.550
I think I left it at the zoo.
No problem.

1449
02:00:21.220 --> 02:00:23.180
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.

1450
02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:27.560
I'll call you. I really will.

1451
02:00:43.540 --> 02:00:47.040
Nicholas, I haven't a clue
what this is all about.

1452
02:00:47.210 --> 02:00:50.500
Your taste in champagne
is excellent as always.

1453
02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:52.340
It was a great entrance.

1454
02:00:53.710 --> 02:00:55.760
Yes, and I want you to know that
what happened on Sunday was...

1455
02:00:55.760 --> 02:00:57.340
Oh, no, no, please.

1456
02:00:57.720 --> 02:01:00.390
I've never been happier
in my whole life.

1457
02:01:00.390 --> 02:01:02.180
I thank you.

1458
02:01:02.180 --> 02:01:04.180
And my wife thanks you.

1459
02:01:05.890 --> 02:01:07.690
Thank you for coming.

1460
02:01:08.270 --> 02:01:09.860
Thank you, Sam.

1461
02:01:12.650 --> 02:01:13.860
What's this?

1462
02:01:13.860 --> 02:01:15.610
This is

1463
02:01:17.530 --> 02:01:18.820
the bill.

1464
02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:21.620
The bill?

1465
02:01:21.620 --> 02:01:23.080
Keep the pen.

1466
02:01:24.450 --> 02:01:26.160
Thank you, both.

1467
02:01:33.630 --> 02:01:34.880
You wanna split it?

1468
02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:37.880
Oh, God, yes, please.
I'll take you up on that.

1469
02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:41.140
Oh, my God.

1470
02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:47.350
Thank you, Connie.

1471
02:01:51.150 --> 02:01:53.520
What happened to that

1472
02:01:53.530 --> 02:01:55.740
waitress? What was
her name, uh...

1473
02:01:56.240 --> 02:01:57.320
Christine?

1474
02:01:57.570 --> 02:01:59.450
She said something about
catching a plane.

1475
02:01:59.450 --> 02:02:02.240
I just saw her out front
trying to hail a cab.

1476
02:02:21.260 --> 02:02:22.640
Christine?

1477
02:02:25.140 --> 02:02:26.520
I, um...

1478
02:02:26.770 --> 02:02:28.770
I didn't get a chance
to say goodbye.

1479
02:02:28.770 --> 02:02:30.480
Thank you. I...

1480
02:02:30.650 --> 02:02:33.650
You know, I never did ask
you your name, did I?

1481
02:02:33.650 --> 02:02:34.860
No.

1482
02:02:35.110 --> 02:02:36.690
It's

1483
02:02:36.690 --> 02:02:37.940
Claire.

1484
02:02:37.950 --> 02:02:40.990
So you catching a plane or...

1485
02:02:40.990 --> 02:02:43.990
Yeah, we have a gig starting
next week in Australia, so...

1486
02:02:43.990 --> 02:02:45.870
Gonna shear some more sheep.

1487
02:02:45.870 --> 02:02:47.500
Just a walk-on this time.

1488
02:02:47.500 --> 02:02:49.620
Well, when you get back,

1489
02:02:52.460 --> 02:02:55.130
maybe, you know, we
could have some dinner.

1490
02:02:56.130 --> 02:02:58.510
You don't know
anything about me.

1491
02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:00.470
No, I don't.

1492
02:03:01.010 --> 02:03:02.300
So you tell me.

1493
02:03:02.550 --> 02:03:04.100
Well, what... Where you're from?

1494
02:03:06.270 --> 02:03:07.560
Originally,

1495
02:03:07.930 --> 02:03:09.270
Oklahoma.

1496
02:03:10.230 --> 02:03:11.480
Colorado?

1497
02:03:15.020 --> 02:03:17.320
I've been doing this
for way too long.

1498
02:03:19.610 --> 02:03:21.110
You know,

1499
02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:24.740
would you like

1500
02:03:25.160 --> 02:03:27.410
to have coffee with
me at the airport?
