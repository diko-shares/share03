00:00:33.427 --> 00:00:37.365
<i>It has been said that magic
vanished from our world</i>

2
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.725
<i>a long time ago,</i>

3
00:00:38.892 --> 00:00:42.829
<i>and that humanity can
no longer fulfill its desires</i>

4
00:00:42.853 --> 00:00:44.898
<i>through the power of wishes.</i>

5
00:00:45.064 --> 00:00:49.067
<i>To those who have lost the
wondrous vision of childhood eyes,</i>

6
00:00:49.194 --> 00:00:53.046
<i>submitted here is
the story of a little boy</i>

7
00:00:53.072 --> 00:00:55.549
<i>and a magical
Christmas wish</i>

8
00:00:55.575 --> 00:00:58.619
<i>that changed
his life forever.</i>

9
00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:06.210
<i>It began in 1985,
in a town just outside Boston.</i>

10
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.400
<i>It was Christmas Eve, and all the
children were in high spirits.</i>

11
00:01:12.424 --> 00:01:14.569
<i>That special time of year</i>

12
00:01:14.593 --> 00:01:16.846
<i>when Boston children
gather together</i>

13
00:01:17.013 --> 00:01:18.765
<i>and beat up the Jewish kids.</i>

14
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.057
Hey, Greenbaum!

15
00:01:21.683 --> 00:01:24.078
It's Jesus' birthday
tomorrow,

16
00:01:24.103 --> 00:01:25.563
and you know what
I'm gonna get him?

17
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:26.789
What?

18
00:01:26.813 --> 00:01:28.775
My fist in your
fucking face!

19
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.734
Why would Jesus want that?

20
00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:31.861
Get him!

21
00:01:36.115 --> 00:01:39.885
<i>But there was one child who
wasn't in such good spirits.</i>

22
00:01:39.911 --> 00:01:41.621
<i>Little John Bennett,</i>

23
00:01:41.746 --> 00:01:43.932
<i>that one boy in
every neighborhood</i>

24
00:01:43.956 --> 00:01:46.709
<i>who just has a tough time
making friends.</i>

25
00:01:47.085 --> 00:01:48.686
Hey, guys, can I play?

26
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.896
Get out of here, Bennett.

27
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.021
Get lost, Bennett!

28
00:01:51.046 --> 00:01:52.064
Get out of here, Bennett!

29
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.591
Yeah, Bennett,
get lost.

30
00:01:56.718 --> 00:01:59.155
<i>John longed
with all his heart</i>

31
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.391
<i>for that one, true friend
that he could call his own.</i>

32
00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:06.745
<i>And he knew that if he
ever found that friend,</i>

33
00:02:06.771 --> 00:02:08.814
<i>he would never let him go.</i>

34
00:02:11.234 --> 00:02:15.612
<i>Well, as it does every year,
Christmas morning finally came.</i>

35
00:02:15.947 --> 00:02:19.950
<i>All the children were opening
their gifts with holiday glee.</i>

36
00:02:27.582 --> 00:02:29.519
<i>And for little John Bennett,</i>

37
00:02:29.544 --> 00:02:34.132
<i>Christmas Day brought a
very special new arrival.</i>

38
00:02:41.097 --> 00:02:43.807
I guess Santa paid attention to
how good you were this year, huh?

39
00:02:44.091 --> 00:02:45.909
Merry Christmas, John.

40
00:02:46.894 --> 00:02:48.021
<i>I love you!</i>

41
00:02:48.603 --> 00:02:50.022
He talks!

42
00:02:51.524 --> 00:02:53.776
I'm going to
name you Teddy.

43
00:02:55.902 --> 00:02:59.632
<i>John became
instantly attached to Teddy.</i>

44
00:02:59.656 --> 00:03:02.259
<i>There was something
about that bear</i>

45
00:03:02.284 --> 00:03:05.805
<i>that made him feel as if
he finally had a friend</i>

46
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.266
<i>with whom he could share
his deepest secrets.</i>

47
00:03:09.292 --> 00:03:10.710
<i>I love you!</i>

48
00:03:11.336 --> 00:03:13.337
I love you, too, Teddy.

49
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:17.966
You know, I wish you
could really talk to me.

50
00:03:18.134 --> 00:03:22.305
Because then, we could be best
friends forever and ever.

51
00:03:23.306 --> 00:03:26.450
<i>Now, if there's one thing
you can be sure of,</i>

52
00:03:26.475 --> 00:03:31.229
<i>it's that nothing is more
powerful than a young boy's wish.</i>

53
00:03:31.813 --> 00:03:34.000
<i>Except an Apache helicopter.</i>

54
00:03:34.025 --> 00:03:37.586
<i>An Apache helicopter has
machine guns and missiles.</i>

55
00:03:37.611 --> 00:03:41.341
<i>It is an unbelievably impressive
complement of weaponry,</i>

56
00:03:41.365 --> 00:03:44.326
<i>an absolute death machine.</i>

57
00:03:45.203 --> 00:03:47.013
<i>Well, as it turned out,</i>

58
00:03:47.038 --> 00:03:50.500
<i>John picked the perfect
night to make a wish.</i>

59
00:04:28.161 --> 00:04:29.372
Teddy?

60
00:04:33.209 --> 00:04:34.502
Teddy?

61
00:04:38.965 --> 00:04:40.048
Teddy?

62
00:04:48.473 --> 00:04:49.558
Hug me.

63
00:04:50.768 --> 00:04:52.978
You're my best friend,
John.

64
00:04:53.271 --> 00:04:55.872
Did you...
Did you just talk?

65
00:04:55.898 --> 00:04:57.417
Don't look so surprised.

66
00:04:57.442 --> 00:04:59.526
You're the one who
wished for it, aren't you?

67
00:05:00.278 --> 00:05:03.738
Yeah.
I did wish for it.

68
00:05:04.031 --> 00:05:05.757
Well, here I am.

69
00:05:05.783 --> 00:05:08.886
You mean, we get to be
best friends for real?

70
00:05:08.911 --> 00:05:10.245
For real.

71
00:05:10.454 --> 00:05:11.706
Forever and ever?

72
00:05:11.997 --> 00:05:13.290
Sounds good to me.

73
00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:18.312
<i>John was just about the
happiest boy in the world</i>

74
00:05:18.336 --> 00:05:21.841
<i>and he couldn't wait to tell
everyone the good news.</i>

75
00:05:22.175 --> 00:05:25.319
Well, I think we've had a
wonderful Christmas this year.

76
00:05:25.343 --> 00:05:26.778
One of the best.

77
00:05:26.803 --> 00:05:29.781
And I particularly enjoyed
the gift you gave me last night.

78
00:05:29.807 --> 00:05:32.601
Well, my big strong husband
works so hard all year.

79
00:05:32.726 --> 00:05:34.978
I figured you deserved
a little Christmas treat.

80
00:05:35.812 --> 00:05:37.481
I'd call it more
than a little treat.

81
00:05:38.774 --> 00:05:41.502
I think those veneers just make
it a smoother ride for me.

82
00:05:41.526 --> 00:05:43.196
Well, that's
how much I love you.

83
00:05:43.321 --> 00:05:46.574
Seriously though, that was
an outstanding blowjob.

84
00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:49.576
Mom, Dad, guess what?
My teddy bear's alive!

85
00:05:50.702 --> 00:05:52.538
Really?
Well, isn't that exciting.

86
00:05:52.704 --> 00:05:55.124
No, Mom, he's really alive.
Look.

87
00:05:55.832 --> 00:05:57.668
Merry Christmas,
everybody.

88
00:05:59.377 --> 00:06:00.504
Jesus H. Fuck!

89
00:06:00.754 --> 00:06:02.273
Let's all be best friends.

90
00:06:02.298 --> 00:06:03.357
Oh, my God!

91
00:06:03.382 --> 00:06:05.442
John, get away from that thing.
Get over here right now.

92
00:06:05.468 --> 00:06:06.968
- But, Dad...
- Get over here!

93
00:06:07.261 --> 00:06:08.653
- Listen to your father!
- Come here!

94
00:06:08.678 --> 00:06:10.615
Helen, get my gun.
Dad, no!

95
00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:11.865
Is it a hugging gun?

96
00:06:11.891 --> 00:06:13.475
Helen, get my gun,
and call the police!

97
00:06:13.725 --> 00:06:14.994
I'm sorry,
Mr. Bennett,

98
00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:16.836
I didn't mean
to scare anybody.

99
00:06:16.978 --> 00:06:19.122
I just wanted John
and I to be friends.

100
00:06:19.148 --> 00:06:22.668
Yeah, Dad, I made a wish
last night that Teddy was alive

101
00:06:22.692 --> 00:06:23.985
and my wish came true.

102
00:06:25.737 --> 00:06:27.447
Oh, my God!

103
00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:30.326
It's a miracle.

104
00:06:31.201 --> 00:06:33.788
It's a Christmas miracle.

105
00:06:34.538 --> 00:06:37.124
You're just like
the Baby Jesus.

106
00:06:37.707 --> 00:06:41.853
<i>Well, it wasn't long before the
story of John's little miracle</i>

107
00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:43.588
<i>was sweeping the nation.</i>

108
00:06:43.755 --> 00:06:45.066
<i>Out of a Boston suburb</i>

109
00:06:45.091 --> 00:06:47.884
<i>comes what is, without a doubt,
the most incredible story...</i>

110
00:06:48.052 --> 00:06:49.903
<i>A young boy's stuffed animal</i>

111
00:06:49.928 --> 00:06:52.555
<i>has magically come to life for,
as yet, unknown reasons...</i>

112
00:06:52.723 --> 00:06:57.353
<i>Look what Jesus did! Look what Jesus did!
Look what Jesus did!</i>

113
00:07:08.906 --> 00:07:12.550
<i>Before long, Teddy had
become a huge celebrity</i>

114
00:07:12.576 --> 00:07:13.911
<i>in his own right.</i>

115
00:07:19.165 --> 00:07:20.334
Hello, Teddy.

116
00:07:24.422 --> 00:07:27.257
You... You are a...
You surprise me.

117
00:07:27.925 --> 00:07:30.194
For some reason I thought you
were going to be taller.

118
00:07:30.218 --> 00:07:32.637
I thought you were
going to be funnier.

119
00:07:40.146 --> 00:07:42.790
<i>You... What are your
favorite television shows?</i>

120
00:07:42.814 --> 00:07:44.834
<i>Um, I like</i>
Gimme a Break...

121
00:07:44.858 --> 00:07:46.252
Dad.
I want a teddy bear.

122
00:07:46.276 --> 00:07:49.754
Hey! What did Daddy just get you
for your birthday, huh?

123
00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:51.590
- A rake.
- That's right.

124
00:07:51.615 --> 00:07:54.093
An excellent rake.
A birthday rake.

125
00:07:54.117 --> 00:07:55.108
So when you
clean the yard,

126
00:07:55.132 --> 00:07:57.221
you don't have to pick up
the leaves with your hands.

127
00:07:57.245 --> 00:07:59.290
But, Dad.
I want the bear on TV.

128
00:07:59.415 --> 00:08:00.891
Donny.
Shut up, will ya?

129
00:08:00.916 --> 00:08:03.101
Daddy's making love
to New Mommy.

130
00:08:03.127 --> 00:08:03.843
But, Daddy!

131
00:08:04.069 --> 00:08:05.137
Go to your hammock!

132
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.755
<i>Do you ever
watch this show?</i>

133
00:08:08.132 --> 00:08:09.716
<i>Yeah. When Leno
guest hosts.</i>

134
00:08:14.721 --> 00:08:17.115
<i>But through all the fame,</i>

135
00:08:17.141 --> 00:08:21.187
<i>Teddy never forgot
his very best friend, John.</i>

136
00:08:21.312 --> 00:08:23.997
The thunder can't get us,
right?

137
00:08:24.023 --> 00:08:27.752
Nope, we're thunder buddies,
and the thunder knows it.

138
00:08:27.776 --> 00:08:29.362
We're totally safe.

139
00:08:30.278 --> 00:08:31.279
Teddy?

140
00:08:31.613 --> 00:08:32.615
Yeah, John?

141
00:08:32.782 --> 00:08:35.368
Do you promise we'll
always be together?

142
00:08:35.993 --> 00:08:37.411
I promise.

143
00:08:39.996 --> 00:08:42.332
Thunder buddies for life.

144
00:08:42.875 --> 00:08:45.461
Thunder buddies for life.

145
00:08:47.004 --> 00:08:51.884
<i>And that was a promise that
neither one of them ever forgot.</i>

146
00:08:52.842 --> 00:08:55.988
<i>So, where are
John and Teddy today?</i>

147
00:08:56.013 --> 00:08:58.157
<i>Well, let me
put it this way.</i>

148
00:08:58.182 --> 00:09:01.451
<i>No matter how big a splash
you make in this world,</i>

149
00:09:01.476 --> 00:09:05.456
<i>whether you're Corey Feldman,
Frankie Muniz, Justin Bieber,</i>

150
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.375
<i>or a talking teddy bear,</i>

151
00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:10.027
<i>eventually,
nobody gives a shit.</i>

152
00:11:43.556 --> 00:11:45.349
<i>Do I dare look
at the clock?</i>

153
00:11:45.724 --> 00:11:49.537
Look, all I'm saying is that
Boston women are, on the whole,

154
00:11:49.562 --> 00:11:52.940
a paler, uglier sort than women
from the elsewheres of life.

155
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:54.750
That's bullshit. What about Lori?
She's hot.

156
00:11:54.774 --> 00:11:56.860
No, Lori's from Pennsylvania.
That's not a Boston girl.

157
00:11:56.985 --> 00:11:58.028
They're not that bad.

158
00:11:58.195 --> 00:12:00.505
See, the fact that you have
to say they're not that bad

159
00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:01.865
means that
they are that bad.

160
00:12:02.157 --> 00:12:04.301
Did you ever hear
a Boston girl have an orgasm?

161
00:12:04.326 --> 00:12:08.721
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah!
Harder! Harder!

162
00:12:08.746 --> 00:12:10.724
Oh, God,
that was so good!

163
00:12:10.749 --> 00:12:13.961
Now I'm going to stuff my fucking
face with Pepperidge Farm!

164
00:12:16.672 --> 00:12:18.756
Jesus, this is weak.

165
00:12:18.923 --> 00:12:20.500
It's not even
getting me high.

166
00:12:20.726 --> 00:12:22.385
I got to have a talk
with my weed guy.

167
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.571
It's working for me.

168
00:12:23.596 --> 00:12:25.239
I think it sucks. I'm going
to have a talk with him.

169
00:12:25.264 --> 00:12:27.575
I don't know that you want to go
to a drug dealer with complaints.

170
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.577
No. I know this guy a long time.
I've known him since 9/11.

171
00:12:30.602 --> 00:12:31.270
You remember?

172
00:12:31.296 --> 00:12:33.496
I was, like, "Oh, shit, 9/11.
I got to get high."

173
00:12:33.563 --> 00:12:35.106
- Is it 9:30?
- Yeah.

174
00:12:35.231 --> 00:12:36.774
Shit, I got to
get to work!

175
00:12:37.067 --> 00:12:38.568
I don't know
if I can drive!

176
00:12:38.818 --> 00:12:40.863
It's okay, I'll drive you.
I feel fine.

177
00:13:03.594 --> 00:13:04.427
Fuck!

178
00:13:04.553 --> 00:13:05.520
Shit.

179
00:13:05.678 --> 00:13:06.721
Oh, man!

180
00:13:06.889 --> 00:13:08.255
Johnny,
I'm sorry, man.

181
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.491
That car just came
out of nowhere.

182
00:13:10.517 --> 00:13:11.934
God, is it bad?

183
00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:14.062
Oh, man!

184
00:13:14.605 --> 00:13:15.399
John!

185
00:13:15.423 --> 00:13:17.832
May I speak with you,
please?

186
00:13:17.857 --> 00:13:18.917
Shit.

187
00:13:18.942 --> 00:13:19.693
It's all right,
go, go, go.

188
00:13:19.719 --> 00:13:20.418
I'll pull out of here.

189
00:13:20.443 --> 00:13:21.653
Hi, Thomas,
how are you?

190
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.559
Asshole!

191
00:13:36.585 --> 00:13:39.046
That's my bad.
I was sending a tweet.

192
00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:43.417
John,
it's almost 10:00.

193
00:13:43.926 --> 00:13:44.994
I know, sir, I'm sorry.

194
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.094
It wasn't my fault.

195
00:13:46.886 --> 00:13:48.071
What do you mean?

196
00:13:51.265 --> 00:13:54.644
I guess I wasn't really prepared
for a follow-up question.

197
00:13:55.562 --> 00:13:58.206
John, all you got to do
is not fuck up

198
00:13:58.231 --> 00:14:00.793
and you get my job when I
go to corporate next month.

199
00:14:00.817 --> 00:14:02.543
You're the new
branch manager.

200
00:14:02.568 --> 00:14:04.629
All you've got to do
is not fuck up.

201
00:14:04.654 --> 00:14:06.155
- I realize that.
- Good.

202
00:14:06.532 --> 00:14:08.200
Glad to hear it.

203
00:14:08.325 --> 00:14:12.096
Because in a month,
my life could be your life.

204
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.139
A cushy, $38,000-a-year
branch manager

205
00:14:15.164 --> 00:14:18.309
who's personal friends
with Tom Skerritt.

206
00:14:18.335 --> 00:14:19.961
Not a bad life,
is it?

207
00:14:20.504 --> 00:14:21.672
No.

208
00:14:22.505 --> 00:14:25.049
I'm going to show you something
that I don't like to show people

209
00:14:25.075 --> 00:14:27.827
because I don't want them
treating me differently.

210
00:14:30.346 --> 00:14:32.432
Boom.
That's me and Skerritt.

211
00:14:33.808 --> 00:14:35.436
Goddamn right, "Wow."

212
00:14:35.894 --> 00:14:37.495
I'm gonna dock you
for dinging the car

213
00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.187
and for showing up
late today, all right?

214
00:14:39.355 --> 00:14:41.290
Try and be a little more
responsible tomorrow.

215
00:14:41.316 --> 00:14:43.000
I will, sir,
I promise.

216
00:14:44.318 --> 00:14:46.219
I'm not going to
let you down, Goose.

217
00:14:46.547 --> 00:14:47.548
What?

218
00:14:48.115 --> 00:14:49.216
<i>Top Gun.</i>

219
00:14:49.783 --> 00:14:50.826
So?

220
00:14:51.534 --> 00:14:52.536
Tom Skerritt.

221
00:14:53.412 --> 00:14:54.663
I know that.

222
00:14:54.955 --> 00:14:56.653
I don't think of him
as an actor anymore.

223
00:14:56.677 --> 00:14:57.682
He's just, like,
a guy.

224
00:14:57.707 --> 00:14:58.543
Like, we work...

225
00:14:58.567 --> 00:15:00.686
We worked on my garage
two months ago.

226
00:15:00.711 --> 00:15:01.727
Helped me hang
a garage door.

227
00:15:01.753 --> 00:15:03.355
You ever hang a garage
door with Tom Skerritt?

228
00:15:03.379 --> 00:15:05.131
- No.
- No.

229
00:15:05.423 --> 00:15:09.427
You ever go miniature golfing with
Tom Skerritt's wife and her kid?

230
00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.554
No. You haven't.

231
00:15:12.472 --> 00:15:14.950
Do you ever watch
a Bulls game,

232
00:15:14.975 --> 00:15:16.951
Chicago Bulls game
in Chicago with Tom Skerritt?

233
00:15:16.976 --> 00:15:17.977
- No.
- No.

234
00:15:18.312 --> 00:15:19.518
You haven't.

235
00:15:19.543 --> 00:15:20.746
All right!?

236
00:15:20.938 --> 00:15:25.067
Liberty, fast track,
Skerritt, John.

237
00:15:25.235 --> 00:15:27.070
Thank you, sir.

238
00:15:27.528 --> 00:15:29.965
All right, here's your keys,
your rental agreement,

239
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:31.700
complimentary
map of Boston.

240
00:15:31.991 --> 00:15:34.385
Thank you for choosing Liberty.
Drive safely.

241
00:15:34.411 --> 00:15:36.120
- Thanks.
- Thanks so much.

242
00:15:37.706 --> 00:15:39.040
I heard you got busted.

243
00:15:39.875 --> 00:15:41.508
Jesus, Guy,
you look like shit, man.

244
00:15:41.533 --> 00:15:42.232
What happened?

245
00:15:42.418 --> 00:15:45.480
I don't know,
I got fucking wasted last night.

246
00:15:45.505 --> 00:15:47.748
My phone says I texted
someone at 3:15,

247
00:15:47.773 --> 00:15:49.283
asking them
to beat me up.

248
00:15:49.676 --> 00:15:53.388
And then, at 4:30, I texted the
same person saying, "Thanks."

249
00:15:53.596 --> 00:15:54.681
And you don't remember it?

250
00:15:54.806 --> 00:15:55.974
No, same as last time.

251
00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.226
It just seems kind of gay,
doesn't it?

252
00:15:58.726 --> 00:16:00.287
I don't know.
Maybe, yeah.

253
00:16:00.312 --> 00:16:02.788
Well, do you think you're part
of some gay beat-up underworld?

254
00:16:02.813 --> 00:16:04.816
Like one of those gay
beat-up clubs or something?

255
00:16:05.107 --> 00:16:06.710
I don't know.
I dig chicks, man.

256
00:16:06.735 --> 00:16:08.711
I don't remember any of it.
I was so fucked up.

257
00:16:08.736 --> 00:16:09.922
I might be gay,
I don't know.

258
00:16:09.947 --> 00:16:11.590
Do you mind covering
for me for a bit?

259
00:16:11.615 --> 00:16:13.158
I might go lay down
in the john.

260
00:16:13.325 --> 00:16:14.884
Hey, buddies.
Where is it hanging?

261
00:16:14.909 --> 00:16:15.527
Hey, Alix,
what's up?

262
00:16:15.552 --> 00:16:16.519
You get in the
club last night?

263
00:16:16.702 --> 00:16:20.182
I didn't get in because
the bouncer was douche-face.

264
00:16:20.206 --> 00:16:21.582
But I made friends
in the line.

265
00:16:21.792 --> 00:16:23.018
That's good,
I guess.

266
00:16:23.043 --> 00:16:25.528
Hey, guys, anybody
know a nice restaurant,

267
00:16:25.553 --> 00:16:26.812
like something
where they give out

268
00:16:26.837 --> 00:16:28.330
free bubblegum
in the bathrooms?

269
00:16:28.356 --> 00:16:29.357
For what?

270
00:16:29.383 --> 00:16:30.900
Lori and I have been dating
4 years tomorrow.

271
00:16:30.926 --> 00:16:32.594
I want to take her
someplace really nice.

272
00:16:32.918 --> 00:16:34.388
Congratulations, John.

273
00:16:34.513 --> 00:16:36.304
You guys have been
going out for 4 years?

274
00:16:36.431 --> 00:16:38.408
My longest relationship
was like 6 months

275
00:16:38.432 --> 00:16:39.951
and then she farted
in her sleep.

276
00:16:39.976 --> 00:16:41.418
I'm like,
"I'm out of here, man."

277
00:16:41.442 --> 00:16:42.754
I was gone
before she woke up.

278
00:16:43.105 --> 00:16:44.940
You're not
very tolerant, huh?

279
00:16:45.274 --> 00:16:46.500
Lori ever fart
in front of you?

280
00:16:46.524 --> 00:16:47.567
Yeah.

281
00:16:48.652 --> 00:16:50.636
- Really?
- Yeah, many times.

282
00:16:51.363 --> 00:16:53.514
- You Italian?
- No.

283
00:16:54.533 --> 00:16:55.576
Why?

284
00:16:56.118 --> 00:16:57.661
Never mind.
Take her to Benihana.

285
00:16:57.827 --> 00:16:59.763
John, look,
don't you think after 4 years

286
00:16:59.788 --> 00:17:01.974
maybe she's hoping for
something more than dinner?

287
00:17:01.999 --> 00:17:03.140
Like what?

288
00:17:03.166 --> 00:17:07.170
I don't know, but if it were me,
I'd be expecting a proposal.

289
00:17:07.546 --> 00:17:09.855
Come on, nobody's expecting
anybody to propose.

290
00:17:09.881 --> 00:17:11.258
I mean,
marriage isn't...

291
00:17:12.467 --> 00:17:13.386
Isn't love enough?

292
00:17:13.412 --> 00:17:14.994
I submit that love
is enough.

293
00:17:15.304 --> 00:17:18.140
You can put the ring in her ass,
let her fart it out.

294
00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.941
So bad,
but so good.

295
00:17:29.108 --> 00:17:30.986
Yeah. It's a study
in contrasts.

296
00:17:31.361 --> 00:17:33.822
Oh,
I love this part right here.

297
00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:36.365
<i>He's for every one of us!</i>

298
00:17:36.907 --> 00:17:38.743
<i>Stands for everyone of us!</i>

299
00:17:38.868 --> 00:17:40.679
<i>He'll save with a mighty hand</i>

300
00:17:40.703 --> 00:17:42.644
<i>Every man,
every woman, every child</i>

301
00:17:42.671 --> 00:17:43.723
<i>With a mighty flash!</i>

302
00:17:43.749 --> 00:17:45.976
Yeah. Fuck, yeah.
Flash! Oh, my God.

303
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.560
Hey, by the way,
don't let me forget,

304
00:17:47.586 --> 00:17:48.894
you and I got to
nail down a plan

305
00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.422
for the Bruins game
tomorrow night.

306
00:17:50.547 --> 00:17:52.773
No, I can't.
I'm taking Lori to dinner.

307
00:17:52.798 --> 00:17:53.858
For what?

308
00:17:53.884 --> 00:17:55.902
Well, we've been dating
4 years tomorrow.

309
00:17:55.926 --> 00:17:57.346
Oh, fuck me.
Nice.

310
00:17:57.762 --> 00:17:59.405
Let me ask you something.

311
00:17:59.431 --> 00:18:01.369
You don't think she's
going to be expecting

312
00:18:01.395 --> 00:18:02.409
something big, do you?

313
00:18:02.459 --> 00:18:03.617
What, like anal?

314
00:18:03.643 --> 00:18:06.771
No, like a fucking circular
gold thing on her finger.

315
00:18:06.896 --> 00:18:07.746
Oh, fuck that!

316
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:09.624
It's been 4 years,
Johnny.

317
00:18:09.648 --> 00:18:11.542
You and me have been
together for 27 years.

318
00:18:11.567 --> 00:18:12.675
Where's my ring?

319
00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:14.445
Where's my ring,
asshole?

320
00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:15.796
Where's my ring,
motherfucker?

321
00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:16.506
Stop it. Come on!

322
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:18.924
Put it on my fuzzy finger,
you fuck! Come on!

323
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:19.992
All right,
knock it off!

324
00:18:20.201 --> 00:18:21.428
All right,
I'm just saying.

325
00:18:21.452 --> 00:18:24.388
But do you think she might be expecting
me to make that kind of a move?

326
00:18:24.413 --> 00:18:25.644
No,
I don't think she is.

327
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:27.733
And, not only that,
it's the wrong time.

328
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:28.953
It's a terrible idea.

329
00:18:28.979 --> 00:18:30.311
I mean,
you got the economy.

330
00:18:30.336 --> 00:18:32.396
You got the credit bubble,
the Supreme Court.

331
00:18:32.422 --> 00:18:33.464
I mean,
look at Haiti.

332
00:18:33.839 --> 00:18:35.650
I guess I didn't
think about that.

333
00:18:35.674 --> 00:18:36.522
Well, that's...

334
00:18:36.648 --> 00:18:37.551
It's a factor.

335
00:18:37.927 --> 00:18:39.011
<i>Who are you?</i>

336
00:18:39.261 --> 00:18:42.641
<i>Flash Gordon. Quarterback,
New York Jets.</i>

337
00:18:43.016 --> 00:18:45.242
This is the American fantasy,
right here.

338
00:18:45.268 --> 00:18:49.163
A professional NFL player
is called upon to save the world.

339
00:18:49.189 --> 00:18:50.210
Tom Brady could do that.

340
00:18:50.435 --> 00:18:51.435
Tom Brady could do that!

341
00:18:52.526 --> 00:18:54.169
- Hey.
- Hey, sweetie.

342
00:18:54.193 --> 00:18:55.252
Hey, Lori.

343
00:18:55.278 --> 00:18:57.029
- Hi.
- Hi.

344
00:18:57.239 --> 00:18:58.339
What do you got there?

345
00:18:58.365 --> 00:18:59.465
Turkey burgers.

346
00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:00.592
Turkey burgers.

347
00:19:00.616 --> 00:19:03.244
Are we having homosexuals
over for dinner tonight?

348
00:19:03.869 --> 00:19:05.497
No, just you homos.

349
00:19:07.415 --> 00:19:10.602
You kind of just reworded
my joke, but, uh...

350
00:19:10.626 --> 00:19:11.627
How was work?

351
00:19:11.752 --> 00:19:12.979
It was fine.

352
00:19:13.003 --> 00:19:14.381
How's your dickhead boss?

353
00:19:14.798 --> 00:19:15.856
Rex is fine.

354
00:19:15.882 --> 00:19:17.412
He only hit on me
once today,

355
00:19:17.436 --> 00:19:18.701
so,
it's a good thing.

356
00:19:18.926 --> 00:19:20.528
Hey, Johnny,
how about a beer?

357
00:19:20.554 --> 00:19:21.988
A couple of
Charles Brew-kowskis?

358
00:19:22.012 --> 00:19:23.865
Couple of
Brew-stoyevskis?

359
00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:25.909
Maybe a
Mike Brew-gaslowski?

360
00:19:25.933 --> 00:19:27.451
Perhaps a
Tedy Brew-ski?

361
00:19:27.477 --> 00:19:28.537
That's a good one.

362
00:19:28.561 --> 00:19:31.998
You know what, I think I, too,
want a Martina Navrati-brewski.

363
00:19:32.022 --> 00:19:33.165
No, that doesn't work.

364
00:19:33.191 --> 00:19:34.233
Don't ruin it. No.

365
00:19:34.442 --> 00:19:35.751
Bullshit!
That totally works.

366
00:19:35.777 --> 00:19:36.836
No, no.

367
00:19:36.862 --> 00:19:38.296
- Yeah, it does.
- It doesn't work.

368
00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.713
The name has to have
a "ski" at the end of it

369
00:19:39.739 --> 00:19:40.660
and you just put
"brewski"

370
00:19:40.684 --> 00:19:42.217
at the end of
"Martina Navratilova," so...

371
00:19:42.241 --> 00:19:44.035
I just thought we were
saying funny names.

372
00:19:44.201 --> 00:19:46.430
No, it has to have
a "ski" at the end of it.

373
00:19:46.454 --> 00:19:47.806
Otherwise,
where's the challenge?

374
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:50.057
If there's no "ski" at
the end of the root word

375
00:19:50.083 --> 00:19:53.002
then we would just be
idiots saying nonsense.

376
00:20:02.261 --> 00:20:03.262
Hey.

377
00:20:03.512 --> 00:20:04.948
They found
the missing hikers.

378
00:20:05.173 --> 00:20:06.074
They did?

379
00:20:06.098 --> 00:20:07.299
- Yeah.
- What happened?

380
00:20:07.558 --> 00:20:08.868
They said
they got separated

381
00:20:08.894 --> 00:20:10.494
and one of them had his
foot stuck under a rock

382
00:20:10.519 --> 00:20:11.913
for like,
5 days.

383
00:20:13.815 --> 00:20:17.376
You know, if your leg got
trapped under a rock

384
00:20:17.402 --> 00:20:18.903
I'd chew it off
to get you free.

385
00:20:19.904 --> 00:20:20.922
You would?

386
00:20:20.946 --> 00:20:22.089
I sure would.

387
00:20:22.115 --> 00:20:23.633
Is that cannibalism?

388
00:20:23.657 --> 00:20:26.178
No, I think it's only
cannibalism if you swallow.

389
00:20:26.202 --> 00:20:27.429
Oh, yeah, no!

390
00:20:27.453 --> 00:20:29.472
Don't worry about that,
because I don't swallow.

391
00:20:29.498 --> 00:20:31.082
Really?
'Cause that's not what I heard.

392
00:20:31.374 --> 00:20:32.723
Well, it's not true,
okay?

393
00:20:32.749 --> 00:20:34.227
I'm a fucking classy broad.

394
00:20:34.251 --> 00:20:35.795
Yeah.

395
00:20:36.253 --> 00:20:38.230
I can see that.

396
00:20:38.256 --> 00:20:40.192
Listen,
speaking of classy,

397
00:20:40.217 --> 00:20:42.443
Ciao Bella is a really
expensive restaurant.

398
00:20:42.469 --> 00:20:45.363
So, we can go
anywhere else tomorrow.

399
00:20:45.387 --> 00:20:47.557
I really don't care,
as long as we're together.

400
00:20:48.141 --> 00:20:49.784
Are you kidding me?

401
00:20:49.808 --> 00:20:50.373
No, no, no.

402
00:20:50.397 --> 00:20:51.619
4 years, we've
been going out.

403
00:20:51.644 --> 00:20:53.288
I'm taking you to
the best place in town.

404
00:20:53.313 --> 00:20:55.080
I've been crapping out
room for it for 2 days.

405
00:20:55.105 --> 00:20:57.150
I mean, I know exactly
what I'm gonna order.

406
00:20:57.275 --> 00:20:59.336
You are so disgusting.

407
00:20:59.361 --> 00:21:00.403
And I love you.

408
00:21:01.238 --> 00:21:02.153
I love you, too.

409
00:21:02.278 --> 00:21:03.265
And you're nasty.

410
00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.467
Do you want to get nasty?

411
00:21:05.491 --> 00:21:07.536
You're a nasty girl.

412
00:21:11.748 --> 00:21:13.807
Fucking
cocksucker motherfucker!

413
00:21:13.833 --> 00:21:14.893
I don't understand.

414
00:21:14.917 --> 00:21:17.645
35 years old and you're
still scared of a little thunder.

415
00:21:17.671 --> 00:21:19.213
I am not!

416
00:21:21.715 --> 00:21:23.090
Thunder buddies for life,
right, Johnny?

417
00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:23.792
Fucking right.

418
00:21:23.817 --> 00:21:25.737
- Let's sing the thunder song.
- All right.

419
00:21:25.761 --> 00:21:28.949
<i>When you hear the sound of thunder
Don't you get too scared</i>

420
00:21:28.973 --> 00:21:32.560
<i>Just grab your thunder buddy
And say these magic words</i>

421
00:21:32.935 --> 00:21:36.272
<i>Fuck you, thunder
You can suck my dick</i>

422
00:21:36.439 --> 00:21:39.276
<i>You can't get me, thunder
'Cause you're just God's farts</i>

423
00:21:43.153 --> 00:21:45.589
Hey, Lori, can you set
the alarm for 11:00 A.M.?

424
00:21:45.615 --> 00:21:47.325
I've got a lot of stuff
to do tomorrow.

425
00:22:00.588 --> 00:22:01.631
Good morning,
Lori.

426
00:22:01.839 --> 00:22:03.424
Good morning.

427
00:22:08.721 --> 00:22:10.574
Okay. You okay there,
sweetheart?

428
00:22:10.598 --> 00:22:12.616
You look
a little flustered.

429
00:22:12.642 --> 00:22:13.742
I'm fine, I'm fine,

430
00:22:13.768 --> 00:22:15.996
I just didn't have time for breakfast
and the garage was full,

431
00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:18.347
oh, and that's right, my boyfriend
can't sleep through a thunderstorm

432
00:22:18.373 --> 00:22:19.582
without his teddy bear.

433
00:22:19.857 --> 00:22:21.625
I don't understand why you
keep putting up with him.

434
00:22:21.651 --> 00:22:23.048
Yeah, I mean,
the guy's 35,

435
00:22:23.073 --> 00:22:25.346
and he's working for
a rental car service.

436
00:22:25.696 --> 00:22:27.298
You know, you guys,
it's really not about that.

437
00:22:27.324 --> 00:22:28.451
I don't care about that.

438
00:22:28.476 --> 00:22:30.468
I mean, I'd love him
if he was a janitor.

439
00:22:30.492 --> 00:22:34.096
I mean, he has a huge
heart and we laugh a lot.

440
00:22:34.122 --> 00:22:37.416
It's just a bonus that he's
the hottest guy in Boston.

441
00:22:37.625 --> 00:22:38.145
I don't know.

442
00:22:38.171 --> 00:22:39.685
I just wish he would
get his life together.

443
00:22:39.711 --> 00:22:42.005
Our life.
And he can't.

444
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.590
And, I swear to God,
it is because of that bear.

445
00:22:44.758 --> 00:22:46.530
You should give him
an ultimatum.

446
00:22:46.556 --> 00:22:47.701
It's you
or the bear.

447
00:22:47.926 --> 00:22:49.266
No, I can't do that.

448
00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:51.072
That would devastate him.

449
00:22:51.096 --> 00:22:54.683
Besides,
what if he chose Ted?

450
00:22:55.018 --> 00:22:56.019
Well, hello there.

451
00:22:56.185 --> 00:22:58.329
Sorry if I'm interrupting
any private girl-talk

452
00:22:58.355 --> 00:22:59.873
about Channing Tatum's
index finger.

453
00:22:59.897 --> 00:23:02.166
But, Lori, I need to
see you in my office.

454
00:23:02.192 --> 00:23:03.032
Yeah,
the thing is, Rex,

455
00:23:03.057 --> 00:23:04.501
I have a lot of work
I need to get to...

456
00:23:04.527 --> 00:23:07.113
Oh, this is work,
I swear.

457
00:23:08.573 --> 00:23:10.282
Great.

458
00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.568
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

459
00:23:13.452 --> 00:23:14.746
He's such an asshole.

460
00:23:14.871 --> 00:23:16.748
Out of control.
He's such a sleaze.

461
00:23:16.873 --> 00:23:19.792
A hundred bucks says he's showing
her the diving team photo.

462
00:23:20.542 --> 00:23:22.854
Check this out.

463
00:23:22.878 --> 00:23:25.272
That's me on
the high school diving team.

464
00:23:25.298 --> 00:23:27.174
We dove the shit out
of that pool that year.

465
00:23:27.925 --> 00:23:29.163
Now, if you look close,

466
00:23:29.189 --> 00:23:31.153
you can see the
outline of my root.

467
00:23:31.179 --> 00:23:32.846
You promised me
this was about work.

468
00:23:32.971 --> 00:23:35.200
Lori,
why don't you like me?

469
00:23:35.224 --> 00:23:37.368
I'm rich, I'm good-looking,
my dad owns the company.

470
00:23:37.394 --> 00:23:38.363
I have a boyfriend.

471
00:23:38.388 --> 00:23:39.537
I have told you this.

472
00:23:39.561 --> 00:23:41.163
Yeah, the guy with the bear.

473
00:23:41.189 --> 00:23:44.233
But I'm talking about
a mature relationship, Lori.

474
00:23:44.401 --> 00:23:47.653
If we were together,
our babies would be spectacular.

475
00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:52.325
With my top-of-the-pyramid
Caucasian genes and your splash of

476
00:23:53.201 --> 00:23:56.663
dark, beautiful, smoky...

477
00:23:56.913 --> 00:23:58.748
Baltic? Czech?

478
00:23:58.914 --> 00:24:00.458
Goodbye, Rex.

479
00:24:00.583 --> 00:24:01.760
Okay, you're fired.

480
00:24:01.786 --> 00:24:02.652
No. I'm not.

481
00:24:28.944 --> 00:24:30.821
Okay, that was perfect.

482
00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:32.673
Would you like me to
wrap your leftovers?

483
00:24:32.699 --> 00:24:34.299
No, I'm good.
Thank you.

484
00:24:34.325 --> 00:24:36.135
Actually, could you
wrap just this up for me?

485
00:24:36.161 --> 00:24:37.302
I want to scare
the shit out of somebody.

486
00:24:37.327 --> 00:24:38.328
Sure.

487
00:24:38.621 --> 00:24:40.664
- What are you, 5-years old?
- Yeah.

488
00:24:40.874 --> 00:24:43.084
But I read at a
6-year-old level, so...

489
00:24:44.501 --> 00:24:48.690
Sir, and madam,
here is your dessert

490
00:24:48.714 --> 00:24:50.674
and champagne.

491
00:24:52.343 --> 00:24:53.736
Cristal.

492
00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.784
It's a special night.

493
00:24:54.809 --> 00:24:56.489
We've been dating
for 4 years.

494
00:24:56.513 --> 00:24:59.142
And hey, all those rich black
people can't be wrong, right?

495
00:25:02.686 --> 00:25:04.564
It doesn't feel like
four years, does it?

496
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:06.523
No, it doesn't.

497
00:25:06.773 --> 00:25:10.127
You know, you had no business
being out on that dance floor,

498
00:25:10.153 --> 00:25:12.196
but I'm really happy
that you were.

499
00:25:18.536 --> 00:25:20.180
This song is so great.

500
00:25:20.204 --> 00:25:20.967
Oh, yeah.

501
00:25:20.991 --> 00:25:23.273
Chris Brown can do no wrong.

502
00:25:23.665 --> 00:25:25.643
Wow,
you can really move.

503
00:25:25.667 --> 00:25:26.693
You like that, huh?

504
00:25:26.719 --> 00:25:27.903
Check this shit out.

505
00:25:34.551 --> 00:25:35.802
Oh, my God!

506
00:25:36.637 --> 00:25:38.030
Are you okay?

507
00:25:38.056 --> 00:25:39.324
Oh, God, I am so sorry.

508
00:25:39.348 --> 00:25:40.575
No, I'm fine,
I'm fine.

509
00:25:40.599 --> 00:25:43.411
Jesus, I am so sorry. I didn't see you.
It was an accident.

510
00:25:43.435 --> 00:25:44.578
Did you hurt your head?

511
00:25:44.604 --> 00:25:46.288
Yeah, my head hurts a lot.

512
00:25:46.314 --> 00:25:47.898
Oh, man. Here, let
me get you some ice.

513
00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.865
Sorry, sorry.
Does it hurt?

514
00:25:58.826 --> 00:26:01.578
No. It's fine.

515
00:26:03.248 --> 00:26:05.916
Okay, here's a test to see how
much you actually care about me.

516
00:26:06.667 --> 00:26:08.603
You remember that night,
after the club

517
00:26:08.627 --> 00:26:12.523
we went and had late-night eggs
and waffles until about 5:00 A.M.

518
00:26:12.548 --> 00:26:15.567
We watched a movie on the
little TV in the diner.

519
00:26:15.593 --> 00:26:16.928
Name that movie.

520
00:26:17.386 --> 00:26:18.429
<i>Octopussy.</i>

521
00:26:18.637 --> 00:26:21.657
Baby! Gold star.

522
00:26:21.682 --> 00:26:24.035
And, by the way,
my dancing was not that bad.

523
00:26:24.059 --> 00:26:25.953
- It was pretty bad.
- I have cool moves.

524
00:26:25.979 --> 00:26:27.413
Yeah, so do people
with Parkinson's.

525
00:26:27.438 --> 00:26:28.748
That's not
how I remember it.

526
00:26:28.772 --> 00:26:30.107
Okay, how do you
remember it?

527
00:27:00.012 --> 00:27:01.972
All right,
whatever you say.

528
00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:03.490
- Hey.
- Yes?

529
00:27:03.516 --> 00:27:04.851
Here's to 4 more years.

530
00:27:05.183 --> 00:27:06.853
- Okay.
- You make me happy.

531
00:27:07.729 --> 00:27:09.288
Now, I know we said
no gifts, but...

532
00:27:09.314 --> 00:27:10.373
We said no such thing.

533
00:27:10.397 --> 00:27:13.292
I got you something anyway,
in clear violation of the "no gift" rule.

534
00:27:13.317 --> 00:27:14.586
We had no such rule.

535
00:27:14.611 --> 00:27:18.030
Lori, I've wanted to give
this to you for a long time.

536
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.451
John.

537
00:27:28.165 --> 00:27:29.667
Those are the ones you like,
right?

538
00:27:29.692 --> 00:27:30.902
From that kiosk
at the mall.

539
00:27:32.002 --> 00:27:33.503
Yeah.

540
00:27:35.548 --> 00:27:37.107
You know, Lori,

541
00:27:37.133 --> 00:27:38.550
someday, there's
going to be a ring in there.

542
00:27:38.968 --> 00:27:40.058
But I want to wait until

543
00:27:40.084 --> 00:27:41.738
I get you something
really special.

544
00:27:41.762 --> 00:27:43.597
I just don't have
the money right now.

545
00:27:45.391 --> 00:27:48.036
Look, I'm only saying this
because I love you.

546
00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:49.561
You're not going to
have any sort of career

547
00:27:49.686 --> 00:27:51.288
if you keep
wasting time with Ted.

548
00:27:51.314 --> 00:27:52.414
Oh, jeez, here we go.

549
00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.125
Baby, please ask
Ted to move out

550
00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:55.585
so we can move on
with our lives.

551
00:27:55.609 --> 00:27:58.211
Lori, look, he's been my
best friend since I was 8.

552
00:27:58.237 --> 00:27:59.864
I was not a popular child.

553
00:28:01.615 --> 00:28:02.231
You have to understand,

554
00:28:02.257 --> 00:28:03.300
I had no friends
before he came along.

555
00:28:03.326 --> 00:28:05.701
He's the only reason I ever
gained any fucking confidence.

556
00:28:05.912 --> 00:28:08.181
I could have wound up like
that Asian kid at Virginia Tech,

557
00:28:08.205 --> 00:28:09.473
but I didn't 'cause of him.

558
00:28:09.499 --> 00:28:10.969
So, you know,
I'm not that psyched

559
00:28:10.993 --> 00:28:12.184
to just, like,
kick him out.

560
00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:14.561
Well, it's good to know that a
talking teddy bear is the only thing

561
00:28:14.586 --> 00:28:16.314
that prevented you from
gunning down your classmates.

562
00:28:16.338 --> 00:28:19.442
But you're no longer 8.
You're 35 years old.

563
00:28:19.467 --> 00:28:21.653
And unless you're
too blind to notice,

564
00:28:21.678 --> 00:28:23.488
he's not your only
friend anymore.

565
00:28:23.512 --> 00:28:25.155
Can we talk about
this another time,

566
00:28:25.181 --> 00:28:26.722
and just enjoy
our anniversary dinner?

567
00:28:37.402 --> 00:28:38.944
Oh, shit,
hang on a second.

568
00:28:39.362 --> 00:28:41.255
Now my phone fell under
the seat somewhere.

569
00:28:41.279 --> 00:28:42.323
Can you call it?

570
00:28:42.531 --> 00:28:43.740
Yeah.

571
00:28:58.088 --> 00:28:59.548
Is that my ringtone?

572
00:28:59.965 --> 00:29:01.384
Oh, yeah.

573
00:29:02.009 --> 00:29:04.028
What is it?
'Cause it sounds negative.

574
00:29:04.053 --> 00:29:05.971
No, no,
it's from <i>The Notebook.</i>

575
00:29:08.473 --> 00:29:10.201
This is going to take
some doing, I think.

576
00:29:10.226 --> 00:29:11.576
I'll just meet
you upstairs then?

577
00:29:11.602 --> 00:29:13.145
Yeah, I'll be right there.

578
00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.006
Lori, hey,
you're home early.

579
00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:25.715
What the hell is this?

580
00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.219
The ladies and I were just
watching <i>Jack and Jill.</i>

581
00:29:28.243 --> 00:29:30.919
Adam Sandler plays
a guy and his sister,

582
00:29:30.943 --> 00:29:32.222
and it's just awful.

583
00:29:32.248 --> 00:29:33.391
It's unwatchable.

584
00:29:33.415 --> 00:29:35.226
But, they're hookers,
so it's fine.

585
00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:37.752
This place is a wreck.
Who are these girls?

586
00:29:37.878 --> 00:29:39.463
Where are my manners?

587
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:42.123
Lori, this is
Angelique, Heavenly,

588
00:29:42.148 --> 00:29:44.285
Cherene,
and Sauvignon Blanc.

589
00:29:44.594 --> 00:29:45.736
I love you girls.

590
00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.086
You know,
somewhere out there

591
00:29:47.113 --> 00:29:48.322
are four
terrible fathers

592
00:29:48.346 --> 00:29:50.450
I wish I could thank
for this great night.

593
00:29:50.474 --> 00:29:51.893
What is that?

594
00:29:52.101 --> 00:29:53.435
What is what?

595
00:29:53.935 --> 00:29:56.122
There is a...

596
00:29:56.146 --> 00:29:58.065
shit on my floor.

597
00:29:58.316 --> 00:30:00.460
In the corner,
there is a shit!

598
00:30:00.484 --> 00:30:02.752
Oh, my God!
You know what?

599
00:30:02.778 --> 00:30:04.713
That's probably what Dierdre
was doing over there.

600
00:30:04.739 --> 00:30:07.215
Remember she was crouched over in
the corner for a really long time?

601
00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.093
I thought she was just making
a phone call or something.

602
00:30:09.117 --> 00:30:11.162
There is a shit
on my floor!

603
00:30:11.287 --> 00:30:11.865
Yeah. Yeah.

604
00:30:11.891 --> 00:30:13.597
She's passed out
in the bathroom now.

605
00:30:13.623 --> 00:30:15.665
She seemed like she was
hopped up on something,

606
00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:18.019
but, you know, mystery solved,
I guess, right?

607
00:30:18.044 --> 00:30:19.311
She was taking a shit.

608
00:30:19.336 --> 00:30:20.546
What the fuck?

609
00:30:22.507 --> 00:30:23.268
Who lives here?

610
00:30:23.292 --> 00:30:25.009
I'm coming to get
whoever lives here.

611
00:30:25.134 --> 00:30:26.469
You owe me
lobster money.

612
00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:28.488
That's my buddy,
Johnny.

613
00:30:28.512 --> 00:30:30.096
Not the lobster,
the guy running it.

614
00:30:30.515 --> 00:30:32.532
I found my phone.

615
00:30:32.557 --> 00:30:33.601
What's going on?

616
00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:37.521
Is that a shit?

617
00:30:53.037 --> 00:30:55.623
God, there are some
fucked-up fish out there.

618
00:30:55.873 --> 00:30:58.183
Look at that one.
WASP-y, white-guy fish.

619
00:30:58.209 --> 00:31:02.813
"I married the wrong woman,
and now I lead a life of regret."

620
00:31:02.837 --> 00:31:04.022
Oh, look at this guy.

621
00:31:04.048 --> 00:31:09.053
"I went to New York once in 1981,
and I just did not feel safe."

622
00:31:10.503 --> 00:31:12.615
Ted, you gotta move out.

623
00:31:14.432 --> 00:31:15.476
What?

624
00:31:16.018 --> 00:31:18.186
It's got to happen.

625
00:31:19.771 --> 00:31:21.898
What did I do?

626
00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.861
My relationship is at a very
delicate stage, you know.

627
00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:29.240
Lori and I may just need
a little space right now.

628
00:31:29.781 --> 00:31:32.718
Plus, a hooker took a
shit in our apartment.

629
00:31:32.742 --> 00:31:34.470
- Oh, God!
- Ah, what?

630
00:31:34.494 --> 00:31:36.221
- Oh, this is so gross!
- Don't tell me!

631
00:31:36.246 --> 00:31:37.148
I don't want to
hear about it!

632
00:31:37.173 --> 00:31:37.964
Did you get it?

633
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:39.924
- No, I didn't get it!
- Tell me when you get it!

634
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:42.394
Oh, my God,
I got some on my thumb!

635
00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:44.755
No! You can never cook
with that hand again!

636
00:31:44.963 --> 00:31:45.406
Oh, my God!

637
00:31:45.432 --> 00:31:46.731
You have to learn
to cook left-handed.

638
00:31:46.757 --> 00:31:48.733
This is the most
disgusting thing ever!

639
00:31:48.759 --> 00:31:50.236
Don't!
Get it away from me!

640
00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:52.179
Look, that was a tough
night for all of us.

641
00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:54.737
Ted,
you mean everything to me,

642
00:31:54.761 --> 00:31:56.032
and so does Lori.

643
00:31:56.057 --> 00:31:57.738
I mean, I'm just
trying to find a way

644
00:31:57.864 --> 00:31:59.345
to keep you
both in my life.

645
00:32:00.605 --> 00:32:02.480
She's making you do it,
isn't she?

646
00:32:03.065 --> 00:32:04.208
Yes.

647
00:32:04.232 --> 00:32:06.090
But that doesn't mean
we can't hang out.

648
00:32:06.115 --> 00:32:07.428
We'll hang out
all the time.

649
00:32:07.862 --> 00:32:10.506
Yeah, but what about
"thunder buddies for life," Johnny?

650
00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:11.172
I know.

651
00:32:11.297 --> 00:32:13.092
I just don't know
what to do, here.

652
00:32:13.116 --> 00:32:17.078
I know it sucks, but otherwise
I'm going to lose her.

653
00:32:17.203 --> 00:32:18.748
And I do love her,
Ted.

654
00:32:19.373 --> 00:32:21.000
I know you do,
Johnny.

655
00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:23.419
I'll help you get on your feet
out there, I promise.

656
00:32:23.877 --> 00:32:25.820
I know. And we'll hang out
all the time, right?

657
00:32:25.962 --> 00:32:27.381
All the time.

658
00:32:27.589 --> 00:32:29.317
Fuck it. Bring it in.
Come here.

659
00:32:29.342 --> 00:32:31.259
Bring it in, you bastard.
Come on.

660
00:32:31.801 --> 00:32:33.054
I love you!

661
00:32:33.304 --> 00:32:36.015
Fuck. Shit, sorry,
that's the thing from the...

662
00:32:36.182 --> 00:32:37.006
The old...

663
00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:38.075
Yeah, yeah.

664
00:32:38.099 --> 00:32:39.576
- I'm not gay.
- I know.

665
00:32:39.602 --> 00:32:41.729
And you're not gay,
so we're fine.

666
00:32:42.938 --> 00:32:45.398
We gotta get you a job.

667
00:32:46.776 --> 00:32:47.917
I look stupid.

668
00:32:47.942 --> 00:32:49.211
No you don't.
You look dapper.

669
00:32:49.236 --> 00:32:51.672
I don't. I look like
Snuggle's accountant.

670
00:32:51.697 --> 00:32:53.048
Come on,
it's not that bad.

671
00:32:53.074 --> 00:32:54.508
John, I look like something
you give your kid

672
00:32:54.532 --> 00:32:56.035
when you tell him
Grandma died.

673
00:32:56.201 --> 00:32:58.136
Look,
I know it sucks, OK?

674
00:32:58.162 --> 00:32:59.262
But you've got to
make some money

675
00:32:59.288 --> 00:33:00.388
so you can pay
for an apartment.

676
00:33:00.413 --> 00:33:02.516
I don't want to work
at a grocery store.

677
00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:03.917
Yeah, but you
have no skills.

678
00:33:04.085 --> 00:33:06.086
I told you,
I can totally be a lawyer.

679
00:33:06.295 --> 00:33:08.689
As I said, you would need a
law degree from a law school.

680
00:33:08.713 --> 00:33:10.732
No. No.
I'm a special case.

681
00:33:10.758 --> 00:33:11.272
I'm a...

682
00:33:11.298 --> 00:33:12.817
I'm a talking teddy bear,
for Christ's sake.

683
00:33:12.843 --> 00:33:14.444
They might make an exception
'cause they'd be all like,

684
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:15.904
"Oh, my God!
This bear's so cool.

685
00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:16.712
"He can talk
and do stuff.

686
00:33:16.739 --> 00:33:17.405
Let's give him a job.

687
00:33:17.431 --> 00:33:19.392
"Maybe he'll give us a few
laughs around the office."

688
00:33:19.557 --> 00:33:20.748
And then they're like,

689
00:33:20.773 --> 00:33:22.369
"Oh, my God!
He can deliver.

690
00:33:22.394 --> 00:33:23.895
"He's actually
quite a litigator."

691
00:33:24.105 --> 00:33:26.564
And then they practically have to
give me the Anderson case.

692
00:33:26.981 --> 00:33:29.902
You get the job,
we're celebrating after, OK?

693
00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:31.895
And if I don't
get the job,

694
00:33:31.921 --> 00:33:33.421
are we still going to
smoke that pot?

695
00:33:33.489 --> 00:33:34.656
Probably, yes.

696
00:33:34.781 --> 00:33:35.534
OK, all right.

697
00:33:35.558 --> 00:33:36.800
Good talk, coach,
thanks.

698
00:33:36.826 --> 00:33:37.992
All right, buddy,
go get 'em.

699
00:33:38.827 --> 00:33:40.762
And don't worry,
I'll do my very best

700
00:33:40.788 --> 00:33:42.914
to get this job
that I so crave.

701
00:33:43.874 --> 00:33:45.584
So you think
you got what it takes?

702
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:47.065
I'll tell you
what I got.

703
00:33:47.089 --> 00:33:48.822
Your wife's pussy
on my breath.

704
00:33:50.923 --> 00:33:53.174
Nobody's ever talked
to me like that before.

705
00:33:53.342 --> 00:33:56.636
That's 'cause everyone's mouth
is usually full of your wife's box.

706
00:33:58.847 --> 00:33:59.973
You're hired.

707
00:34:00.223 --> 00:34:01.307
Shit.

708
00:34:47.271 --> 00:34:50.958
Well, I am a former celebrity
in a minimum wage job.

709
00:34:50.983 --> 00:34:53.793
This is how the cast of
<i>Diff'rent Strokes</i> feels.

710
00:34:53.818 --> 00:34:55.166
All day,
every day.

711
00:34:55.192 --> 00:34:56.088
Just awful.

712
00:34:56.112 --> 00:34:57.045
They must feel awful.

713
00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:58.465
The live ones
must feel awful.

714
00:34:58.490 --> 00:34:59.632
Come on.
It's not that bad, okay?

715
00:34:59.657 --> 00:35:00.465
I got a shitty job,

716
00:35:00.489 --> 00:35:02.143
and I assure you,
I am quite content.

717
00:35:02.286 --> 00:35:03.496
Excuse me.

718
00:35:03.661 --> 00:35:04.889
I'm sorry to bother you

719
00:35:04.914 --> 00:35:08.918
but my son and I couldn't help
but admire your teddy bear.

720
00:35:09.418 --> 00:35:10.894
- Oh, thank you.
- Thanks.

721
00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:14.005
Yeah. I'm Donny,
this is Robert.

722
00:35:14.172 --> 00:35:14.862
I have to say,

723
00:35:14.887 --> 00:35:17.012
I've been following you
ever since I was a young boy

724
00:35:18.092 --> 00:35:20.762
and I remember seeing you
on the Carson Show.

725
00:35:20.929 --> 00:35:22.264
You were just wonderful.

726
00:35:22.431 --> 00:35:24.824
Oh, yeah, that was
a weird interview.

727
00:35:24.849 --> 00:35:28.269
Ed thought I was ALF, and he kept
muttering anti-Semitic comments.

728
00:35:28.436 --> 00:35:30.456
He thought ALF was
Jewish for some reason.

729
00:35:30.481 --> 00:35:32.190
Have you ever considered
selling the bear?

730
00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.501
- What?
- Excuse me?

731
00:35:33.525 --> 00:35:34.793
I want it.

732
00:35:34.818 --> 00:35:35.969
I'm not an "it,"
pal.

733
00:35:36.094 --> 00:35:37.396
I'm a "he",
all right?

734
00:35:37.612 --> 00:35:39.632
I'm sorry, little guy,
but my bear isn't for sale.

735
00:35:39.657 --> 00:35:41.592
See, I've had him
since I was about your age.

736
00:35:41.617 --> 00:35:43.385
He's very, very
special to me.

737
00:35:43.409 --> 00:35:45.663
Stand up straight when
you're talking to me.

738
00:35:45.996 --> 00:35:47.764
Why the fuck
would he say that?

739
00:35:47.789 --> 00:35:50.851
Sorry, you really shouldn't
swear in front of children.

740
00:35:50.876 --> 00:35:52.628
Look, we're very
interested in the bear.

741
00:35:52.753 --> 00:35:54.396
If you want to make
some sort of arrangement

742
00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.130
here's my address
and phone number.

743
00:35:56.297 --> 00:35:58.608
And you can call me
any time, okay?

744
00:35:58.634 --> 00:35:59.677
Will do.

745
00:35:59.842 --> 00:36:02.780
Here it goes, in the really important
pocket for really important stuff.

746
00:36:02.804 --> 00:36:04.431
Okay? Okay.

747
00:36:04.597 --> 00:36:05.030
OK.

748
00:36:05.056 --> 00:36:06.324
See you later.

749
00:36:06.349 --> 00:36:07.409
Come on, Robert.

750
00:36:07.434 --> 00:36:08.434
Take it easy.

751
00:36:08.601 --> 00:36:09.644
What the fuck?

752
00:36:09.811 --> 00:36:11.829
Can you imagine what that
little shit would do to me?

753
00:36:11.855 --> 00:36:13.791
I could totally see him just
taking you down to the basement

754
00:36:13.815 --> 00:36:15.416
and really slowly
de-limbing you

755
00:36:15.442 --> 00:36:17.777
while singing some creepy
Victorian nursery rhyme.

756
00:36:18.152 --> 00:36:20.630
<i>Oh, my little sixpence
My pretty little sixpence</i>

757
00:36:20.655 --> 00:36:21.429
Stop it.

758
00:36:21.954 --> 00:36:22.490
Knock it off.

759
00:36:22.815 --> 00:36:24.175
<i>I love my sixpence
Better than my life</i>

760
00:36:24.201 --> 00:36:24.711
Stop it! Fuck!

761
00:36:24.737 --> 00:36:26.135
Why you got to
take it to that place?

762
00:36:26.161 --> 00:36:27.152
You took it to a very...

763
00:36:27.179 --> 00:36:28.764
Now it's real.
Now it's a real thing.

764
00:36:28.789 --> 00:36:30.014
Come on.
Take it easy.

765
00:36:30.039 --> 00:36:33.001
All right, look, let's just find
a better place to get stoned.

766
00:36:54.856 --> 00:36:56.483
I guess this is it,
huh?

767
00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:58.943
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess so.

768
00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:00.336
First night on your own.

769
00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:03.699
Yeah, first night in my
beautiful new apartment.

770
00:37:04.324 --> 00:37:05.867
It'll be great
when it's furnished.

771
00:37:06.034 --> 00:37:08.570
Yeah, and the guy said it ain't
hardly had no murders in it.

772
00:37:08.594 --> 00:37:10.514
So, that's good.

773
00:37:11.248 --> 00:37:14.083
Okay, so,
if you need anything...

774
00:37:14.251 --> 00:37:15.213
Yeah, I know.

775
00:37:15.239 --> 00:37:17.905
Don't worry, Johnny,
I'll be fine.

776
00:37:18.755 --> 00:37:20.757
I know you will.

777
00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:22.675
All right.

778
00:37:48.409 --> 00:37:49.844
Hey there.

779
00:37:49.869 --> 00:37:50.971
Hey.

780
00:37:50.996 --> 00:37:52.581
- Hi.
- Hi.

781
00:37:54.916 --> 00:37:58.545
Listen, I just want
to say thank you.

782
00:37:59.463 --> 00:38:02.925
I know what you did
with Ted wasn't easy,

783
00:38:03.425 --> 00:38:06.903
and I just want you to know
that I love you for it,

784
00:38:06.929 --> 00:38:10.766
and I think it's a new beginning
for our relationship.

785
00:38:11.141 --> 00:38:13.911
Hey, anything for you.

786
00:38:13.936 --> 00:38:16.454
This is all part of the new,
grown-up adult John Bennett,

787
00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:19.208
so you better
get used to him.

788
00:38:19.233 --> 00:38:20.275
Really?

789
00:38:21.235 --> 00:38:23.503
Well, you know,

790
00:38:23.528 --> 00:38:27.199
I don't have to be at work
for another 20 minutes.

791
00:38:27.949 --> 00:38:29.635
Well, that's perfect.

792
00:38:29.659 --> 00:38:31.536
Because I'm only
going to need one.

793
00:38:34.623 --> 00:38:36.958
You know what my favorite
thing about you is?

794
00:38:37.291 --> 00:38:41.963
That, even after four years,
you can still surprise me.

795
00:38:43.297 --> 00:38:47.443
Like, to step up and change
such a huge part of your life

796
00:38:47.469 --> 00:38:50.179
just to make
your girlfriend happier...

797
00:38:50.722 --> 00:38:51.394
I don't know,

798
00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:53.333
I guess most guys
wouldn't do that.

799
00:38:53.474 --> 00:38:56.811
Well, most guys don't have
you to motivate them.

800
00:38:59.188 --> 00:39:01.942
I know I'm not
a talking teddy bear,

801
00:39:03.193 --> 00:39:06.028
but at least you didn't have to
make a magical wish to get me.

802
00:39:06.739 --> 00:39:08.197
How do you know?

803
00:39:20.626 --> 00:39:22.478
Is that a Flash Gordon
ray gun,

804
00:39:22.503 --> 00:39:24.255
or are you just
happy to see me?

805
00:39:31.764 --> 00:39:33.264
There we go.

806
00:39:33.724 --> 00:39:35.916
Thank you very much,
please come again.

807
00:39:35.943 --> 00:39:37.585
We have a lot more groceries.

808
00:39:43.358 --> 00:39:45.168
Hey, Ellen.

809
00:39:45.193 --> 00:39:46.195
Yeah?

810
00:39:46.487 --> 00:39:47.528
Who's that over there?

811
00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.673
That's the
new checkout girl.

812
00:39:50.699 --> 00:39:52.367
Don't know her name.
Seems cute.

813
00:39:52.534 --> 00:39:53.400
Yeah, very cute.

814
00:39:53.427 --> 00:39:55.646
Do you know what
I'd like to do to her?

815
00:39:55.788 --> 00:39:57.623
Something I call
a Dirty Fozzie.

816
00:40:31.532 --> 00:40:34.034
Okay, all right, so that's
where we'll draw the line.

817
00:40:38.413 --> 00:40:39.998
Hey, how are you
holding up?

818
00:40:40.916 --> 00:40:41.844
Oh, I'm all right.

819
00:40:41.869 --> 00:40:44.235
I'm just getting used
to things, that's all.

820
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:45.936
It's gonna be all right.

821
00:40:46.213 --> 00:40:49.358
I actually went through something
like this with my last boyfriend.

822
00:40:49.382 --> 00:40:50.800
- Really?
- Yeah.

823
00:40:51.552 --> 00:40:53.737
We were together
for 8 months,

824
00:40:53.764 --> 00:40:55.454
and I really loved him.

825
00:40:55.597 --> 00:40:58.534
And then he got
deported back to Iran,

826
00:40:58.559 --> 00:41:00.018
so I know what
you're going through.

827
00:41:00.434 --> 00:41:01.521
Oh, yeah.

828
00:41:01.545 --> 00:41:04.798
So, I guess we both
lost our furry little guy.

829
00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.483
We sure did.

830
00:41:12.114 --> 00:41:13.840
Hey, Ted. Hey, Johnny,
what are you doing?

831
00:41:13.865 --> 00:41:15.449
You want to come over
and catch a buzz?

832
00:41:15.617 --> 00:41:17.135
Well, I could probably
stop by after work.

833
00:41:17.159 --> 00:41:19.847
Fuck that. I traded off yesterday
so I got the other shift.

834
00:41:19.871 --> 00:41:21.467
Come on, I'm bored
as crap over here.

835
00:41:21.492 --> 00:41:22.516
Just swing by for a bit.

836
00:41:22.541 --> 00:41:24.126
I cannot just ditch work,
man.

837
00:41:24.251 --> 00:41:25.351
Look, I'm trying to
get my shit together

838
00:41:25.376 --> 00:41:27.170
and be an adult here,
for Lori's sake.

839
00:41:27.336 --> 00:41:29.648
John, 5 minutes and then
I'll kick you out, I promise.

840
00:41:29.672 --> 00:41:30.722
Just come over.

841
00:41:30.746 --> 00:41:32.818
I got the <i>Cheers</i> DVD box set

842
00:41:32.842 --> 00:41:34.443
and the guy down
at the store told me

843
00:41:34.469 --> 00:41:36.969
that everybody talks shit about
each other in the interviews.

844
00:41:37.972 --> 00:41:39.115
You'll kick me out
in five?

845
00:41:39.141 --> 00:41:40.318
I will kick you out in 5.

846
00:41:40.342 --> 00:41:41.617
John,
I have to kick you out.

847
00:41:41.643 --> 00:41:43.554
I have so much
teddy bear paperwork

848
00:41:43.579 --> 00:41:45.172
I have to get to,
it is sick.

849
00:41:45.313 --> 00:41:46.748
What do I tell Thomas?

850
00:41:46.773 --> 00:41:48.150
<i>Just tell him
you don't feel well.</i>

851
00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:50.460
I gotta cut out for a bit.

852
00:41:50.485 --> 00:41:51.920
Lori tried to
break up a dog fight

853
00:41:51.945 --> 00:41:53.403
and I guess she
got hurt pretty bad.

854
00:41:53.572 --> 00:41:54.672
Oh, my God!

855
00:41:54.697 --> 00:41:56.465
Yeah, that's
the way she is.

856
00:41:56.490 --> 00:41:58.010
She sees trouble and
she wants to help out,

857
00:41:58.034 --> 00:42:00.637
and I guess one of these dogs
clamped his jaws on her forearm

858
00:42:00.661 --> 00:42:02.472
and wouldn't let go
until the fireman showed up

859
00:42:02.496 --> 00:42:04.666
and stuck his finger
in his ass.

860
00:42:05.458 --> 00:42:06.518
Oh, Jesus.

861
00:42:06.543 --> 00:42:07.835
Yeah, she's
pretty shook up.

862
00:42:08.128 --> 00:42:09.813
Up the dog's ass,
right?

863
00:42:09.838 --> 00:42:11.523
Yeah, up the dog's,
not the fireman's ass.

864
00:42:11.547 --> 00:42:14.025
I thought the fireman stuck his
own finger up his own ass.

865
00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:15.860
No, I don't think a
firefighter would do that.

866
00:42:15.885 --> 00:42:17.987
Go, take care of it.
Let me know how she is.

867
00:42:18.012 --> 00:42:19.514
- Thank you.
- Go.

868
00:42:23.643 --> 00:42:25.829
<i>Was there cocaine</i>
<i>on the set of</i> Cheers?

869
00:42:25.853 --> 00:42:28.106
<i>Um, let me see, what's
the best way to answer that?</i>

870
00:42:29.056 --> 00:42:32.460
<i>Are there naked dicks
in gay porn?</i>

871
00:42:32.735 --> 00:42:36.572
<i>Yeah. Yeah, there was a...
There was cocaine on the set,</i>

872
00:42:36.782 --> 00:42:38.407
<i>but it was the '80s, man.
You know?</i>

873
00:42:38.867 --> 00:42:42.244
<i>I was the king of the '80s.
I was Ted-fucking-Danson.</i>

874
00:42:42.536 --> 00:42:45.998
<i>More importantly, I was
Sam-fucking- "Mayday" Malone.</i>

875
00:42:46.208 --> 00:42:49.061
<i>What was your other question?
Oh, yeah, was I popular?</i>

876
00:42:49.485 --> 00:42:53.206
<i>Are there naked dicks
in gay porn?</i>

877
00:42:53.748 --> 00:42:58.052
<i>Yeah. Yeah. No, I was,
I was beloved.</i>

878
00:42:59.221 --> 00:43:00.972
You know, he's exactly
who you want him to be.

879
00:43:01.097 --> 00:43:04.409
He is. He is a man we can
all model ourselves after.

880
00:43:04.434 --> 00:43:05.818
<i>Woody Harrelson.</i>

881
00:43:05.844 --> 00:43:08.355
<i>Smallest dick I've
ever seen on a man.</i>

882
00:43:10.648 --> 00:43:12.208
See, that's why
I watch these things.

883
00:43:12.233 --> 00:43:14.568
That's like a cool behind-the-scenes
thing that you wouldn't know.

884
00:43:14.945 --> 00:43:16.630
Oh, hey,
listen, try this.

885
00:43:16.655 --> 00:43:18.864
I told my weed guy to
step it up and he gave me that.

886
00:43:19.282 --> 00:43:20.384
What is it?

887
00:43:20.409 --> 00:43:22.827
It's called "Mind Rape."
It's actually pretty mellow.

888
00:43:23.286 --> 00:43:24.596
It doesn't sound
very mellow.

889
00:43:24.621 --> 00:43:26.597
Well, he only had
three other batches.

890
00:43:26.623 --> 00:43:27.974
"Gorilla Panic,"

891
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.934
"They're Coming,
They're Coming,"

892
00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.811
and something called,
"This is Permanent."

893
00:43:31.836 --> 00:43:32.838
Go on, spark it up.

894
00:43:39.969 --> 00:43:40.929
There you go.

895
00:43:40.954 --> 00:43:41.913
You got it.

896
00:43:43.181 --> 00:43:45.061
Nice. Good, huh?

897
00:43:45.385 --> 00:43:46.476
Good job.

898
00:43:47.393 --> 00:43:49.420
Yeah.
Take pride in that.

899
00:43:49.896 --> 00:43:51.289
You know,
this place looks great.

900
00:43:51.313 --> 00:43:53.166
Thanks, man,
it's all IKEA.

901
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:54.851
Did the whole place
for $47.

902
00:43:54.985 --> 00:43:56.628
- Nice.
- Yeah.

903
00:43:56.652 --> 00:43:58.112
How are the neighbors?

904
00:43:58.655 --> 00:44:00.673
You know, there's an
Asian family living next door

905
00:44:00.699 --> 00:44:02.175
but they don't have
a gong or nothing,

906
00:44:02.199 --> 00:44:03.068
so it's not too bad.

907
00:44:03.092 --> 00:44:04.927
- That's lucky.
- Yeah, it is.

908
00:44:05.202 --> 00:44:06.972
- How's work?
- It sucks.

909
00:44:07.496 --> 00:44:08.514
You?

910
00:44:08.539 --> 00:44:09.724
You know,
not bad actually.

911
00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:11.208
I met a girl.
She's a cashier.

912
00:44:11.376 --> 00:44:12.978
- No way, that's awesome!
- Yeah.

913
00:44:13.003 --> 00:44:14.730
Well, we should fucking
double-date, or something.

914
00:44:14.755 --> 00:44:16.440
You, me and Lori,
and what's her name?

915
00:44:16.465 --> 00:44:17.965
White trash name.
Guess.

916
00:44:19.009 --> 00:44:20.510
- Mandy?
- No.

917
00:44:21.344 --> 00:44:22.512
- Marilyn?
- No.

918
00:44:22.679 --> 00:44:24.514
- Britney? Tiffany?
- No. No.

919
00:44:24.681 --> 00:44:25.824
- Candice?
- No.

920
00:44:25.849 --> 00:44:27.476
Don't fuck with me on this.
I know this shit!

921
00:44:27.601 --> 00:44:29.327
- Do you see me fucking with you?
- All right, speed round.

922
00:44:29.351 --> 00:44:30.619
I'm going to
rattle off some names

923
00:44:30.644 --> 00:44:31.829
and when I hit it,
fucking buzz it.

924
00:44:31.855 --> 00:44:33.146
- I will tell you.
- You got me?

925
00:44:33.231 --> 00:44:34.416
All right,
Brandi, Heather, Channing,

926
00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:35.708
Breanna, Amber,
Sabrina, Melody,

927
00:44:35.733 --> 00:44:37.043
Dakota, Sierra,
Bambi, Crystal,

928
00:44:37.068 --> 00:44:38.945
Samantha, Autumn, Ruby,
Taylor, Tara, Tami,

929
00:44:39.112 --> 00:44:41.505
Lauren, Charlene, Chantal,
Courtney, Misty, Jenny, Krista,

930
00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:43.467
Mindy, Noelle, Shelby,
Trina, Reba, Cassandra,

931
00:44:43.492 --> 00:44:45.077
Nikki, Kelsey, Shawna,
Jolene, Earline, Claudine,

932
00:44:45.242 --> 00:44:47.244
Savannah, Kasey, Dolly, Kendra,
Carla, Chloe, Devon, Emmylou.

933
00:44:47.411 --> 00:44:48.829
- Fucking Becky?
- No.

934
00:44:49.539 --> 00:44:52.041
Wait, was it any one of those
names with a "Lynn" after it?

935
00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:53.351
Yes.

936
00:44:53.376 --> 00:44:54.585
I got you,
motherfucker.

937
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:56.170
I got you. Okay.

938
00:44:56.338 --> 00:44:58.023
Brandi-Lynn, Heather-Lynn, Channing...
Tami-Lynn.

939
00:44:58.047 --> 00:44:59.132
Fuck!

940
00:45:02.677 --> 00:45:03.737
What the hell?

941
00:45:03.762 --> 00:45:06.030
Hey, man, you think you can
open more than one register?

942
00:45:06.056 --> 00:45:07.740
There's, like,
1,000 people here.

943
00:45:07.766 --> 00:45:10.034
There's supposed to be
three registers open.

944
00:45:10.059 --> 00:45:11.728
For God's sakes.

945
00:45:25.074 --> 00:45:27.744
Stick your finger
in the loop of my tag.

946
00:45:28.577 --> 00:45:31.222
You had sexual intercourse
with a co-worker

947
00:45:31.248 --> 00:45:34.083
on top of the produce
that we sell to the public.

948
00:45:34.251 --> 00:45:36.561
I fucked her with
a parsnip last week

949
00:45:36.585 --> 00:45:39.965
and I sold the parsnip to a
family with four small children.

950
00:45:40.757 --> 00:45:42.322
That took guts.

951
00:45:42.847 --> 00:45:44.411
We need guts.

952
00:45:44.552 --> 00:45:46.262
I'm promoting you.

953
00:45:46.929 --> 00:45:49.099
You got a lot of problems,
don't you?

954
00:46:02.528 --> 00:46:03.655
All right, Kareem!

955
00:46:04.905 --> 00:46:06.782
You suck, Kareem.

956
00:46:13.331 --> 00:46:14.666
Hello?

957
00:46:23.175 --> 00:46:24.634
Hey, Ted.

958
00:46:26.677 --> 00:46:28.637
Hey there, fella.
How are you?

959
00:46:29.556 --> 00:46:31.016
Are you out here
all alone?

960
00:46:31.307 --> 00:46:33.309
Uh, no,
no, I'm not.

961
00:46:34.018 --> 00:46:36.454
You know, you're never alone
when you're with Christ.

962
00:46:36.478 --> 00:46:38.831
So, no,
I'm not alone.

963
00:46:38.856 --> 00:46:41.693
Yeah.
Me, too.

964
00:46:44.778 --> 00:46:47.990
You know, Robert and I could
give you a very, very good home.

965
00:46:48.157 --> 00:46:50.427
Yeah, I'm pretty happy
where I am.

966
00:46:50.452 --> 00:46:51.969
I just got
a shitty new apartment...

967
00:46:51.994 --> 00:46:54.789
I can offer you
$6,000 in railroad bonds.

968
00:46:55.456 --> 00:46:57.434
Well, you know,
since I just returned

969
00:46:57.458 --> 00:46:59.226
from active duty
in the Civil War

970
00:46:59.251 --> 00:47:00.686
that actually
sounds very appealing.

971
00:47:00.711 --> 00:47:01.980
Oh, wait, I'm sorry.

972
00:47:02.005 --> 00:47:05.175
That was 150 years ago
and I don't give a shit.

973
00:47:05.675 --> 00:47:06.885
Okay.

974
00:47:09.304 --> 00:47:09.996
Teddy,
come on,

975
00:47:10.021 --> 00:47:12.072
we're going to be late
for dinner with your friends.

976
00:47:12.097 --> 00:47:13.657
Okay, be there
in a second, baby.

977
00:47:13.682 --> 00:47:15.994
As you can see, my dance
card is quite full.

978
00:47:16.018 --> 00:47:17.686
So, I'm going to
have to decline.

979
00:47:17.853 --> 00:47:19.146
Can I just get a hug?

980
00:47:19.521 --> 00:47:21.483
Oh, uh. No.

981
00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:23.193
- Yeah.
- No, no.

982
00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:25.101
And it kills me to
have to tell you no,

983
00:47:25.126 --> 00:47:26.387
because I'm
a people pleaser.

984
00:47:26.528 --> 00:47:27.614
Yeah.

985
00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.657
Thank you for
creeping up my night.

986
00:47:29.824 --> 00:47:31.509
- And Jesus be with you...
- Okay.

987
00:47:31.534 --> 00:47:32.534
...in Christ.

988
00:47:34.161 --> 00:47:35.597
Who was that guy?

989
00:47:35.621 --> 00:47:37.389
That was
Sinead O'Connor.

990
00:47:37.414 --> 00:47:38.708
She don't look
so good no more.

991
00:47:44.922 --> 00:47:46.315
See.
I was all pissed off

992
00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:47.608
'cause me and my
friend Danielle

993
00:47:47.634 --> 00:47:49.693
was supposed to go
skydiving last year,

994
00:47:49.719 --> 00:47:51.831
but then she got pregnant
from this asshole guy,

995
00:47:51.856 --> 00:47:52.822
and so we couldn't go.

996
00:47:52.847 --> 00:47:54.181
And I was all upset.

997
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:56.701
But then
she had a miscarriage

998
00:47:56.726 --> 00:47:58.661
and so, we ended up
getting to go skydiving.

999
00:47:58.686 --> 00:47:59.889
And it was so scary,

1000
00:47:59.916 --> 00:48:01.840
but it was,
like, so much fun.

1001
00:48:02.106 --> 00:48:04.608
Hey, well, sounds like
everything worked out then, huh?

1002
00:48:04.775 --> 00:48:05.985
I know!

1003
00:48:06.012 --> 00:48:09.639
You know, it's like God wanted
me to go skydiving, you know?

1004
00:48:09.822 --> 00:48:10.824
Jesus.

1005
00:48:11.157 --> 00:48:12.161
Or Jesus.
Him, too.

1006
00:48:12.186 --> 00:48:13.050
Could be him.

1007
00:48:13.076 --> 00:48:14.077
Yeah.

1008
00:48:14.369 --> 00:48:15.175
How great is this?

1009
00:48:15.201 --> 00:48:16.429
The 4 of us out to dinner.

1010
00:48:16.454 --> 00:48:18.206
How long have we been saying
we were going to...

1011
00:48:18.373 --> 00:48:19.360
Lori, how you doing?

1012
00:48:19.385 --> 00:48:21.184
I haven't talked
to you in forever.

1013
00:48:21.208 --> 00:48:23.018
I'm good. I'm good.

1014
00:48:23.043 --> 00:48:25.688
The company's having their 20th
anniversary party next week.

1015
00:48:25.713 --> 00:48:27.340
So, that's something.

1016
00:48:27.632 --> 00:48:29.775
Lori's a senior VP at a big,
huge PR firm.

1017
00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:31.610
It's not that
big of a deal.

1018
00:48:31.635 --> 00:48:32.961
Company's turning 20,
huh?

1019
00:48:32.987 --> 00:48:35.503
So you can bang it,
but you can't get it drunk.

1020
00:48:35.889 --> 00:48:37.992
Right?
Yeah, she gets it.

1021
00:48:38.018 --> 00:48:40.394
She enjoys my humor.

1022
00:48:40.978 --> 00:48:43.039
Yeah. I mean, Rex
is having a house party

1023
00:48:43.063 --> 00:48:45.458
but I'm surprised John
didn't tell you, considering

1024
00:48:45.483 --> 00:48:48.760
you 2 have seen each other every
single day since you moved out.

1025
00:48:49.028 --> 00:48:50.168
Well, you know,
it's funny,

1026
00:48:50.195 --> 00:48:52.340
'cause whenever
Johnny and I hang out

1027
00:48:52.364 --> 00:48:54.675
the first item
on our agenda is,

1028
00:48:54.701 --> 00:48:55.909
"What's going on
with Lori?"

1029
00:48:56.077 --> 00:48:58.304
So, it's funny that
that didn't come up.

1030
00:48:58.329 --> 00:48:59.389
That must have
slipped through the cracks.

1031
00:48:59.414 --> 00:49:00.931
Yeah, but we do talk
about you all the time.

1032
00:49:00.956 --> 00:49:02.809
Yeah, you remember the
other day, I was saying

1033
00:49:02.833 --> 00:49:05.210
how great Lori's
hair always looks.

1034
00:49:05.503 --> 00:49:07.480
Oh, my God,
it always looks so great!

1035
00:49:07.505 --> 00:49:09.481
I always want to
fucking brush it.

1036
00:49:09.507 --> 00:49:10.717
Right, Johnny?
I say that.

1037
00:49:13.635 --> 00:49:15.195
So, Tami-Lynn,

1038
00:49:15.221 --> 00:49:17.614
why don't you tell us
a little bit about yourself?

1039
00:49:17.639 --> 00:49:18.824
Like,
where are you from?

1040
00:49:18.849 --> 00:49:21.518
I'm always fascinated
to meet Ted's girlfriends.

1041
00:49:21.936 --> 00:49:23.579
What do you mean
"girlfriends"?

1042
00:49:23.605 --> 00:49:25.273
Was there a lot of them
or something?

1043
00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:27.817
No, that's not what she meant at all.
Right, Lori?

1044
00:49:27.942 --> 00:49:29.525
- Lori, you didn't mean that.
- No, no, no.

1045
00:49:29.652 --> 00:49:31.445
What I meant to say was
Ted's very handsome

1046
00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:33.590
so I'm always
interested in meeting

1047
00:49:33.614 --> 00:49:35.365
the lady that
can snatch him up.

1048
00:49:35.992 --> 00:49:37.260
Did you just
call me a whore?

1049
00:49:37.284 --> 00:49:38.286
What?

1050
00:49:38.452 --> 00:49:40.068
You just worry about
your own "snatch."

1051
00:49:40.092 --> 00:49:41.019
How about that,
honey?

1052
00:49:41.998 --> 00:49:42.769
What the hell happened?

1053
00:49:42.795 --> 00:49:43.974
We're having a
friendly meal here.

1054
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.059
This was a nice evening.

1055
00:49:45.085 --> 00:49:46.210
Don't talk shit to me.

1056
00:49:46.376 --> 00:49:47.811
I just asked you
a question.

1057
00:49:47.836 --> 00:49:49.297
You know,
you're a freaking snob.

1058
00:49:49.463 --> 00:49:50.648
You think you're
cool because you work

1059
00:49:50.672 --> 00:49:52.483
at some fucking fancy
shit place, whatever.

1060
00:49:52.509 --> 00:49:53.474
OK, take it easy.

1061
00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:54.693
Nice, Lori, real nice.

1062
00:49:54.719 --> 00:49:57.030
Me? It's not my fault
she can't speak English.

1063
00:49:57.054 --> 00:49:58.239
Oh, fuck you!

1064
00:49:58.264 --> 00:50:00.291
Just because you're on the
business world and shit you think,

1065
00:50:00.317 --> 00:50:02.242
what, everybody should suck your
asshole, or something?

1066
00:50:02.268 --> 00:50:03.748
OK. All right, Tami,
come on, honey.

1067
00:50:03.773 --> 00:50:04.621
Let's get out of here.

1068
00:50:04.646 --> 00:50:07.039
We'll go back to my place for a
couple of vodka and strawberry Quiks.

1069
00:50:07.065 --> 00:50:07.722
You know what?

1070
00:50:07.748 --> 00:50:09.717
Stick your fucking asshole
right up your fucking ass.

1071
00:50:09.818 --> 00:50:10.478
How about that?

1072
00:50:10.505 --> 00:50:12.461
You're lucky I'm in my fucking
restaurant clothes, bitch.

1073
00:50:12.487 --> 00:50:14.297
'Cause I'd kick your
fucking ass right now.

1074
00:50:14.322 --> 00:50:15.590
I gave birth once,
bitch.

1075
00:50:15.614 --> 00:50:16.907
I could kick
your fucking ass.

1076
00:50:17.157 --> 00:50:18.364
And you better
never show your face

1077
00:50:18.389 --> 00:50:19.302
around Quincy,
you hear me?

1078
00:50:19.327 --> 00:50:20.594
- Okay, come on.
- Ever!

1079
00:50:20.619 --> 00:50:22.329
I didn't know you had a baby.
Is it alive?

1080
00:50:24.039 --> 00:50:25.208
What a cunt.

1081
00:50:25.375 --> 00:50:27.059
I hate that word!

1082
00:50:27.085 --> 00:50:28.228
- What?
- That word.

1083
00:50:28.253 --> 00:50:29.813
It's so sharp,
it's like an electric sword

1084
00:50:29.838 --> 00:50:31.021
slashing
everything in its path.

1085
00:50:31.047 --> 00:50:32.356
Why would you say that?

1086
00:50:32.382 --> 00:50:34.175
You didn't exactly
stand up for me.

1087
00:50:34.384 --> 00:50:35.943
I'm trying to
walk a line, here.

1088
00:50:35.969 --> 00:50:37.320
I want to be fair to you
and to him, you know?

1089
00:50:37.344 --> 00:50:39.239
I think you're being a
little more fair to him.

1090
00:50:39.264 --> 00:50:40.389
Oh, come on.

1091
00:50:41.516 --> 00:50:44.893
You know, your boss called this
morning asking me how my arm was.

1092
00:50:46.896 --> 00:50:50.065
Yeah, because of that dog fight
that I tried to break up.

1093
00:50:52.318 --> 00:50:53.545
If I had to make a guess

1094
00:50:53.570 --> 00:50:55.838
I would say that you made
up some bullshit excuse

1095
00:50:55.864 --> 00:50:57.297
to get out of work
to go to Ted's.

1096
00:50:57.623 --> 00:50:59.701
Now, am I right?

1097
00:51:01.244 --> 00:51:02.469
I made you out to
be a hero.

1098
00:51:02.494 --> 00:51:03.887
You know what, John,
we asked Ted to move out

1099
00:51:03.913 --> 00:51:05.456
so we can give ourselves
a chance without him.

1100
00:51:05.706 --> 00:51:07.583
You're not giving
anything a chance

1101
00:51:07.708 --> 00:51:08.858
if you keep
blowing off work

1102
00:51:08.884 --> 00:51:10.277
to get high with
your teddy bear.

1103
00:51:11.628 --> 00:51:13.255
You're right.

1104
00:51:13.965 --> 00:51:15.385
I've been getting
stoned too much.

1105
00:51:15.411 --> 00:51:16.175
I know that.

1106
00:51:16.317 --> 00:51:18.596
I've been bumming around
with Ted too much.

1107
00:51:18.621 --> 00:51:19.528
I know that, too.

1108
00:51:19.554 --> 00:51:20.744
You give me
one more chance,

1109
00:51:20.769 --> 00:51:22.030
I promise I can fix it.

1110
00:51:22.891 --> 00:51:24.141
John,
I need a man.

1111
00:51:24.168 --> 00:51:26.577
Not a little boy
with a teddy bear.

1112
00:51:26.603 --> 00:51:27.612
I know, done. Man.

1113
00:51:27.639 --> 00:51:29.914
Right here,
in front of you, all right?

1114
00:51:29.938 --> 00:51:31.195
Look at these pecs.

1115
00:51:31.221 --> 00:51:32.583
These are man pecs.

1116
00:51:32.608 --> 00:51:35.068
Look at the hair on my upper lip.
That's man hair.

1117
00:51:36.153 --> 00:51:36.916
I just farted.

1118
00:51:36.942 --> 00:51:38.139
That was a man fart.

1119
00:51:45.288 --> 00:51:47.068
Fine, John,
but this is,

1120
00:51:47.094 --> 00:51:49.692
I swear to God,
your last chance.

1121
00:51:50.126 --> 00:51:51.460
Trust me. I love you.

1122
00:51:51.793 --> 00:51:53.128
All right, I love you.

1123
00:51:53.295 --> 00:51:54.152
I love you so much.

1124
00:51:54.179 --> 00:51:55.530
You won't be sorry,
I swear.

1125
00:51:56.465 --> 00:51:57.800
Did you really
just fart?

1126
00:51:57.967 --> 00:52:00.052
Yeah, but I pushed it
that way with my hand.

1127
00:52:00.969 --> 00:52:02.822
I wonder who it's
going to hit first.

1128
00:52:02.847 --> 00:52:04.681
So, if I told him once,
I told him a million times

1129
00:52:04.806 --> 00:52:07.702
these numbers
do not add up.

1130
00:52:07.726 --> 00:52:09.661
Who did this to us?

1131
00:52:09.686 --> 00:52:13.106
God damn it!
I'm here on business!

1132
00:52:17.195 --> 00:52:18.862
All right,
here we go.

1133
00:52:22.157 --> 00:52:23.635
I'm really glad
that you came.

1134
00:52:23.659 --> 00:52:24.969
- Me, too.
- Yeah?

1135
00:52:24.994 --> 00:52:27.096
Is it okay if I kick
your boss's ass?

1136
00:52:27.121 --> 00:52:29.239
That won't affect your
workplace chemistry, will it?

1137
00:52:29.264 --> 00:52:30.807
Please play nice.

1138
00:52:30.833 --> 00:52:32.059
For you, I will.

1139
00:52:32.085 --> 00:52:33.643
- Thank you.
- Anything.

1140
00:52:36.297 --> 00:52:37.036
There she is.

1141
00:52:37.161 --> 00:52:39.025
I was worried
you weren't coming.

1142
00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:40.237
Hey, squirt,
how you doing?

1143
00:52:40.264 --> 00:52:41.793
Where's your bunny rabbit?

1144
00:52:41.969 --> 00:52:43.028
He's a bear.

1145
00:52:43.054 --> 00:52:44.431
Got it.
Oh, my God!

1146
00:52:44.456 --> 00:52:46.532
This house is fucking huge!

1147
00:52:46.556 --> 00:52:48.237
I know.
Try not to get lost.

1148
00:52:48.264 --> 00:52:49.043
Come on in.

1149
00:53:00.445 --> 00:53:02.532
Wow!
Here are the ladies.

1150
00:53:02.699 --> 00:53:03.875
Look at you guys.

1151
00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:05.559
You guys look amazing.

1152
00:53:05.702 --> 00:53:06.963
A little heavy
on the eye makeup,

1153
00:53:07.090 --> 00:53:07.769
but pretty good.

1154
00:53:07.911 --> 00:53:09.054
- Thank you, Rex.
- Thank you.

1155
00:53:09.079 --> 00:53:10.181
You guys know
Lori and Jim, right?

1156
00:53:10.206 --> 00:53:11.306
John.

1157
00:53:11.331 --> 00:53:12.625
- You guys remember John.
- Hi.

1158
00:53:12.875 --> 00:53:16.920
Listen, why don't John and I
go get a drink at the bar?

1159
00:53:17.746 --> 00:53:18.547
Sure.

1160
00:53:18.672 --> 00:53:20.182
Great,
we'll be right back.

1161
00:53:20.208 --> 00:53:21.159
Come on, buddy.

1162
00:53:22.552 --> 00:53:24.387
It's an old sweater,
huh?

1163
00:53:24.762 --> 00:53:27.114
This house is
unbelievable.

1164
00:53:27.139 --> 00:53:28.324
Haven't you
been here before?

1165
00:53:28.349 --> 00:53:29.409
What do you mean?

1166
00:53:29.434 --> 00:53:31.744
You know,
when you and Rex were...

1167
00:53:31.768 --> 00:53:33.663
Oh, no.
That was at work.

1168
00:53:33.688 --> 00:53:35.873
You guys did it
in the office?

1169
00:53:35.898 --> 00:53:37.625
- Yeah.
- Where?

1170
00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:39.085
In the men's room.

1171
00:53:39.110 --> 00:53:40.670
Oh, my God.

1172
00:53:40.695 --> 00:53:42.530
Why? Where did you
sleep with him?

1173
00:53:42.697 --> 00:53:44.324
Here.

1174
00:53:46.117 --> 00:53:47.744
Sorry.

1175
00:53:48.119 --> 00:53:50.179
It was in
the handicapped stall,

1176
00:53:50.204 --> 00:53:53.333
so it was nicer than
the regular stalls.

1177
00:53:54.876 --> 00:53:56.978
This is Wade Boggs'
autographed bat.

1178
00:53:57.003 --> 00:53:59.688
I just barely outbid Phil
Donahue for that at auction.

1179
00:53:59.713 --> 00:54:00.815
Wow, cool.

1180
00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:02.858
Yeah, cool.

1181
00:54:02.884 --> 00:54:05.969
These boxing gloves were worn by
Joe Louis in his first fight.

1182
00:54:07.054 --> 00:54:09.056
This is art.
Get it?

1183
00:54:11.893 --> 00:54:13.702
These were
John Lennon's glasses.

1184
00:54:13.728 --> 00:54:15.538
They're worth,
like, a million dollars.

1185
00:54:15.563 --> 00:54:17.023
That's me
and Tom Skerritt.

1186
00:54:18.358 --> 00:54:19.817
Check this out.

1187
00:54:20.985 --> 00:54:23.211
It's Lance Armstrong's nut.

1188
00:54:23.237 --> 00:54:24.989
I had it
freeze-dried and bronzed.

1189
00:54:25.655 --> 00:54:27.175
Every now and then
when my life's

1190
00:54:27.199 --> 00:54:29.409
getting me down
and things are tough,

1191
00:54:29.577 --> 00:54:32.538
I just come up here
and I look at it.

1192
00:54:33.831 --> 00:54:37.376
And it reminds me that
things aren't so bad.

1193
00:54:39.253 --> 00:54:41.213
Sometimes you feel
like a nut.

1194
00:54:42.172 --> 00:54:43.800
Sometimes you don't.

1195
00:54:45.467 --> 00:54:49.155
So, talk to me, Johnny Quest. How
are things with you and Lori?

1196
00:54:49.179 --> 00:54:50.739
Things are great,
actually.

1197
00:54:50.764 --> 00:54:53.016
That's great.
That is great.

1198
00:54:54.434 --> 00:54:57.121
You know, Lori would
hate me for saying this,

1199
00:54:57.146 --> 00:54:59.356
but she told me how
you are at the office.

1200
00:54:59.523 --> 00:55:01.250
And, as one gentleman to
another, I just want to say

1201
00:55:01.275 --> 00:55:03.527
I really hope you fucking
get Lou Gehrig's disease.

1202
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:09.367
I think I need to clear
the air here a little.

1203
00:55:09.534 --> 00:55:12.702
Yeah, I'm kind of a
fun-time boss and what-not.

1204
00:55:12.869 --> 00:55:15.847
But, look, man, I do that
with everybody at the office.

1205
00:55:15.873 --> 00:55:17.099
I'm a kook.

1206
00:55:17.125 --> 00:55:19.226
I have no designs
on your girlfriend.

1207
00:55:19.251 --> 00:55:21.295
We work together,
and that's it.

1208
00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:25.215
I think you're a great guy
and she's a very lucky girl.

1209
00:55:26.884 --> 00:55:28.235
Well, that's good to hear.

1210
00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:29.469
Yeah.

1211
00:55:31.431 --> 00:55:32.472
Excuse me.

1212
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:34.409
Hey, Ted.

1213
00:55:34.434 --> 00:55:36.702
<i>Johnny, where are you? You
got to get over here, man.</i>

1214
00:55:36.726 --> 00:55:37.786
Why, what's going on?

1215
00:55:37.811 --> 00:55:39.204
Okay, so I'm having
a little impromptu thing

1216
00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:40.623
with some people
at my apartment.

1217
00:55:40.648 --> 00:55:42.942
And, John,
Sam Jones is here.

1218
00:55:43.358 --> 00:55:44.418
What?

1219
00:55:44.443 --> 00:55:47.505
<i>Sam Jones.
Flash-fucking-Gordon is here.</i>

1220
00:55:47.530 --> 00:55:48.755
Holy shit! What?

1221
00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:51.384
You remember I said my buddy's
cousin is friends with Sam Jones?

1222
00:55:51.409 --> 00:55:52.885
My buddy's in town
with his cousin,

1223
00:55:52.909 --> 00:55:54.744
and who do you think is with him?
Sam Jones.

1224
00:55:54.911 --> 00:55:57.472
<i>Sam Jones is here,
and, John,</i>

1225
00:55:57.498 --> 00:56:00.083
<i>his hair is
parted down the middle.</i>

1226
00:56:00.585 --> 00:56:01.936
Just like in the movie.

1227
00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:04.380
<i>Yes. Get over here
right now.</i>

1228
00:56:04.547 --> 00:56:05.856
Fuck, I can't!

1229
00:56:05.882 --> 00:56:07.757
I'm with Lori here.
I'm already on probation.

1230
00:56:10.094 --> 00:56:11.278
I can't.

1231
00:56:11.304 --> 00:56:14.739
John, Flash Gordon was the most important
influence of our formative years.

1232
00:56:14.764 --> 00:56:17.201
He taught us right from
wrong, good from evil.

1233
00:56:17.226 --> 00:56:19.077
And that the word
"acting" apparently

1234
00:56:19.103 --> 00:56:20.855
has an extremely
broad definition.

1235
00:56:21.021 --> 00:56:24.291
<i>Flash Gordon is the symbol
of our friendship, John.</i>

1236
00:56:24.317 --> 00:56:26.443
<i>Come share this with me.</i>

1237
00:56:27.402 --> 00:56:28.695
I'm coming.

1238
00:56:29.237 --> 00:56:31.114
Rex, I got to go.

1239
00:56:31.907 --> 00:56:34.217
I'll be back in 30 minutes,
tops, okay?

1240
00:56:34.242 --> 00:56:36.867
But Lori cannot find out. She
absolutely cannot know I was gone.

1241
00:56:37.288 --> 00:56:39.998
If you can cover for me, I'm
cool with all that other shit.

1242
00:56:40.625 --> 00:56:43.001
I got your back on this. She won't know.
I've been there.

1243
00:56:43.168 --> 00:56:44.769
All right, this is
one man to another.

1244
00:56:44.795 --> 00:56:46.938
I don't really know you, but
I'm trusting you, as a man.

1245
00:56:46.963 --> 00:56:48.007
This is serious.

1246
00:56:48.298 --> 00:56:52.052
Dude, one man to another.
I got you on this.

1247
00:56:52.219 --> 00:56:54.304
Thank you.
I'll be back.

1248
00:56:55.806 --> 00:56:57.849
I'm going to have sex
with your girlfriend.

1249
00:57:39.516 --> 00:57:41.309
Johnny, thank Christ
you made it.

1250
00:57:41.476 --> 00:57:43.161
Dude, I got 10 minutes.
Where's Flash Gordon?

1251
00:57:43.186 --> 00:57:44.246
Okay, get ready.

1252
00:57:44.271 --> 00:57:46.690
Hey, Sam, this is the guy
I was telling you about.

1253
00:57:54.197 --> 00:57:55.199
<i>Flash!</i>

1254
00:57:57.909 --> 00:57:59.536
<i>Savior of the universe!</i>

1255
00:58:07.545 --> 00:58:08.545
<i>Flash!</i>

1256
00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:12.382
<i>He'll save every one of us!</i>

1257
00:58:15.885 --> 00:58:19.931
<i>Just a man
with a man's courage</i>

1258
00:58:21.224 --> 00:58:24.144
<i>He knows nothing but a man</i>

1259
00:58:24.936 --> 00:58:27.273
<i>But he can never fail</i>

1260
00:58:29.065 --> 00:58:34.405
<i>No one but the pure in heart
Can find the golden grail</i>

1261
00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:49.586
How you doing?
Good to meet you.

1262
00:58:50.963 --> 00:58:53.190
I thank you for
saving every one of us.

1263
00:58:53.215 --> 00:58:54.257
Well, you're welcome.

1264
00:58:54.634 --> 00:58:55.967
He acknowledged it.

1265
00:58:56.135 --> 00:58:57.235
Let's do some shots.

1266
00:58:57.260 --> 00:58:58.304
With you?

1267
00:58:58.471 --> 00:59:00.530
Oh, my God, yes!
Oh, my God, yes!

1268
00:59:00.556 --> 00:59:01.599
Let's go!

1269
00:59:05.518 --> 00:59:06.621
Thanks, Flash.

1270
00:59:06.646 --> 00:59:08.271
There you go, my friend.
Thank you.

1271
00:59:08.481 --> 00:59:10.315
Death to Ming!

1272
00:59:10.815 --> 00:59:11.983
Yes!

1273
00:59:14.778 --> 00:59:16.322
You know,
you guys seem pretty cool.

1274
00:59:16.489 --> 00:59:17.989
You like to party?

1275
00:59:20.742 --> 00:59:21.802
Cocaine, right?

1276
00:59:21.827 --> 00:59:22.577
Come on, dudes.

1277
00:59:22.601 --> 00:59:24.646
Don't tell me you
never done it before.

1278
00:59:25.164 --> 00:59:27.333
Not recently, no.

1279
00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:29.393
I thought that was just
for people in Florida.

1280
00:59:29.418 --> 00:59:30.628
You better follow me.

1281
00:59:30.795 --> 00:59:31.978
Come on.

1282
00:59:32.003 --> 00:59:33.630
Johnny, I'm frightened.

1283
00:59:42.514 --> 00:59:45.201
We are going to
party like the '80s.

1284
00:59:45.226 --> 00:59:46.452
Show us how, Flash.

1285
00:59:46.476 --> 00:59:47.786
It's easy.

1286
00:59:47.811 --> 00:59:50.246
We just gotta nail a lot
of girls named Stephanie.

1287
00:59:50.271 --> 00:59:52.333
God, Johnny,
I got so much energy.

1288
00:59:52.358 --> 00:59:54.150
We better start
doing stupid shit.

1289
01:00:02.702 --> 01:00:04.052
Look, Johnny,
if we're ever going to

1290
01:00:04.077 --> 01:00:05.346
get serious about
opening a restaurant

1291
01:00:05.371 --> 01:00:06.429
we got to start
planning it now.

1292
01:00:06.454 --> 01:00:07.681
- Italian.
- Italian, yes.

1293
01:00:07.706 --> 01:00:09.474
- What's the special on Tuesdays?
- Eggplant parm.

1294
01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:10.601
Chopped salad,
half price.

1295
01:00:10.626 --> 01:00:11.851
And it's
a non-restricted place.

1296
01:00:11.876 --> 01:00:13.813
- Yeah. What do you mean?
- Anybody can come.

1297
01:00:13.838 --> 01:00:15.313
- Of course.
- Jews are welcome.

1298
01:00:15.338 --> 01:00:16.481
Well, yeah.
Why wouldn't they be?

1299
01:00:16.507 --> 01:00:17.650
Exactly,
that's what I'm saying.

1300
01:00:17.675 --> 01:00:18.818
Why even bring that up?

1301
01:00:18.842 --> 01:00:20.110
You don't bring it up,
you just let them in.

1302
01:00:20.135 --> 01:00:21.653
- Why mention it?
- No one will.

1303
01:00:21.679 --> 01:00:22.780
Why are we
talking about it?

1304
01:00:22.804 --> 01:00:23.467
You're talking about it.

1305
01:00:23.492 --> 01:00:24.322
I'm just saying,
let them in.

1306
01:00:24.347 --> 01:00:25.503
Let them in.
Right. Okay.

1307
01:00:25.528 --> 01:00:26.242
Exactly. Good.

1308
01:00:26.266 --> 01:00:27.268
No Mexicans, though.

1309
01:00:30.353 --> 01:00:32.231
This is how everybody
sang in the '90s.

1310
01:00:44.034 --> 01:00:46.077
- Trust me, I can do this.
- Shut up.

1311
01:00:46.244 --> 01:00:47.413
Let him try it, man.

1312
01:00:47.538 --> 01:00:48.748
All right, fuck it.

1313
01:00:52.251 --> 01:00:54.210
Go, go, go!

1314
01:01:02.719 --> 01:01:04.112
You son of a bitch!

1315
01:01:04.137 --> 01:01:06.306
Well, you never should have trusted me.
I'm on drugs.

1316
01:01:15.231 --> 01:01:17.126
Hey, Johnny,
I just had a great idea.

1317
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:19.628
Let's go get drunk and puke
on cars from the overpass.

1318
01:01:19.652 --> 01:01:22.739
Come on, I do not sound
that much like Peter Griffin.

1319
01:01:25.701 --> 01:01:27.827
You can do any '90s
song with just vowels.

1320
01:01:34.876 --> 01:01:38.047
<i>A-E-I-O-U</i>

1321
01:01:40.257 --> 01:01:43.485
See? There, proof. Garfield's
eyes look like a pair of tits.

1322
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:44.570
You were right.

1323
01:01:44.594 --> 01:01:47.219
If you can punch through this wall,
you really are Flash Gordon.

1324
01:01:47.347 --> 01:01:48.449
Are you going to do it?

1325
01:01:48.474 --> 01:01:49.474
I'm going to
punch through it.

1326
01:01:49.641 --> 01:01:50.934
- Come on, Sam, do it!
- Do it!

1327
01:01:51.936 --> 01:01:53.938
Oh, my God!

1328
01:01:55.356 --> 01:01:56.690
Yes! He did it!

1329
01:01:58.108 --> 01:01:59.192
What the hell you problem?

1330
01:01:59.318 --> 01:02:01.945
You break my wall!
I break you wall!

1331
01:02:06.407 --> 01:02:07.467
Break his arm off!

1332
01:02:07.492 --> 01:02:09.286
We're going to die.
We're all going to die.

1333
01:02:09.411 --> 01:02:10.929
Break this up,
break this up.

1334
01:02:10.954 --> 01:02:11.956
Get him!

1335
01:02:13.164 --> 01:02:16.101
You break my wall!
This my home long time.

1336
01:02:16.126 --> 01:02:17.978
You break my wall,
you bastard men.

1337
01:02:18.003 --> 01:02:19.438
We're sorry,
it was an accident, OK?

1338
01:02:19.463 --> 01:02:22.148
I try to make duck dinner,
now plaster everywhere.

1339
01:02:22.173 --> 01:02:23.793
Chill out. Can we
just talk about this?

1340
01:02:23.818 --> 01:02:24.952
What's your name?
I'm John.

1341
01:02:25.094 --> 01:02:26.554
My name is Wan Ming.

1342
01:02:26.846 --> 01:02:27.887
Ming?

1343
01:02:28.054 --> 01:02:29.864
You pay many dollar
for wall!

1344
01:02:29.889 --> 01:02:32.601
This bullshit!
This all bullshit!

1345
01:02:32.768 --> 01:02:34.769
Death to Ming!

1346
01:02:58.376 --> 01:02:59.503
Rape!

1347
01:03:02.213 --> 01:03:03.257
Sam, let him go.

1348
01:03:08.762 --> 01:03:10.889
You crazy!
You crazy, man!

1349
01:03:11.306 --> 01:03:12.766
Come on, James Franco.

1350
01:03:15.894 --> 01:03:18.021
You pay for wall!

1351
01:03:18.355 --> 01:03:19.856
Move, sucker!

1352
01:03:37.583 --> 01:03:39.626
Greatest night ever!

1353
01:03:50.471 --> 01:03:51.679
Hey.

1354
01:03:51.972 --> 01:03:53.014
Hey, Guy.

1355
01:03:53.222 --> 01:03:54.641
What's going on?

1356
01:03:55.559 --> 01:03:56.329
This is Jared.

1357
01:03:56.355 --> 01:03:58.003
He's the guy
who beat me up.

1358
01:03:58.394 --> 01:03:59.896
And we're in love.

1359
01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:04.777
Turns out I'm gay,
or whatever.

1360
01:04:05.568 --> 01:04:06.612
I had no idea.

1361
01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:10.990
Hey, Jared, let's go grab
another one of these.

1362
01:04:14.536 --> 01:04:15.663
How we doing, ace?

1363
01:04:16.163 --> 01:04:17.456
You coming down?

1364
01:04:17.623 --> 01:04:19.458
Yeah, I don't feel so good.

1365
01:04:19.625 --> 01:04:22.585
Give it a couple of hours.
You'll be golden, Ponyboy.

1366
01:04:23.086 --> 01:04:24.380
You want a Xanax?

1367
01:04:25.965 --> 01:04:27.231
Holy shit. Oh, my God.

1368
01:04:27.257 --> 01:04:28.257
What?

1369
01:04:29.425 --> 01:04:31.094
I got to go.

1370
01:04:39.143 --> 01:04:40.186
Lori, I...

1371
01:04:41.605 --> 01:04:42.773
Lori!

1372
01:04:44.650 --> 01:04:46.943
Lori, wait, please.

1373
01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:49.755
Look, I'm sorry,
I messed up...

1374
01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:51.657
John, I need you out of
the apartment tonight.

1375
01:04:52.115 --> 01:04:53.592
Can I... Just give
me the car keys.

1376
01:04:53.617 --> 01:04:55.494
Can I please just explain?
No.

1377
01:04:55.702 --> 01:04:56.762
Look, I was...

1378
01:04:56.786 --> 01:04:59.206
I have given up a huge
chunk of my life for you.

1379
01:04:59.373 --> 01:05:02.001
I was going to stop in for like five
minutes and then Flash Gordon...

1380
01:05:02.166 --> 01:05:04.128
Just give me
the car keys.

1381
01:05:14.471 --> 01:05:15.764
Lori.

1382
01:05:16.139 --> 01:05:17.682
Lori, please, I love you.

1383
01:05:31.487 --> 01:05:34.257
Johnny, there you are.
I had to get some air.

1384
01:05:34.282 --> 01:05:36.427
That guy from your office
is in there on the couch

1385
01:05:36.452 --> 01:05:38.579
making out with that
Van Wilder-looking guy.

1386
01:05:38.829 --> 01:05:41.204
You know what? Fuck you. I don't
even want to talk to you.

1387
01:05:41.706 --> 01:05:42.807
What?

1388
01:05:42.833 --> 01:05:45.143
Do you know
what just happened?

1389
01:05:45.168 --> 01:05:46.266
Do you have any clue?

1390
01:05:46.293 --> 01:05:47.871
My fucking life just ended!

1391
01:05:48.255 --> 01:05:49.815
Come on.
She'll go home,

1392
01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:51.800
she'll watch Bridget Jones
- something-asshole.

1393
01:05:51.824 --> 01:05:54.235
She'll have a good cry, she'll be fine.
You'll talk to her tomorrow.

1394
01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:56.130
Come on upstairs.
Are you even listening to me?

1395
01:05:56.155 --> 01:05:58.282
Do you give any
shred of a shit?

1396
01:05:59.349 --> 01:06:01.159
Of course I do, Johnny.

1397
01:06:01.184 --> 01:06:03.119
"Thunder buddies
for life," remember?

1398
01:06:03.144 --> 01:06:05.789
Jesus! Lori was right.

1399
01:06:05.813 --> 01:06:08.231
I should have stopped hanging
out with you a long time ago.

1400
01:06:08.358 --> 01:06:10.277
I'm never going to have
a life with you around.

1401
01:06:10.443 --> 01:06:12.963
I'm 35 years old
and I'm going nowhere.

1402
01:06:12.987 --> 01:06:16.507
All I do is smoke pot and watch
movies with a teddy-fucking-bear.

1403
01:06:16.532 --> 01:06:19.036
Because of that,
I just lost the love of my life.

1404
01:06:19.786 --> 01:06:21.163
Johnny, I'm...

1405
01:06:21.329 --> 01:06:22.456
I'm sorry.

1406
01:06:22.623 --> 01:06:23.791
I gotta be on my own,
Ted.

1407
01:06:23.916 --> 01:06:25.284
I can't see you anymore.

1408
01:06:27.668 --> 01:06:29.797
John, wait. Listen.

1409
01:06:30.172 --> 01:06:32.298
<i>I love you!</i>

1410
01:07:31.483 --> 01:07:34.987
So, word through the
grapevine is that you're

1411
01:07:35.112 --> 01:07:36.295
newly solo.

1412
01:07:36.405 --> 01:07:38.322
Rex, I have a lot of
work I need to get to.

1413
01:07:38.657 --> 01:07:41.802
I have tickets to Norah Jones
at the Hatch Shell tonight

1414
01:07:41.827 --> 01:07:44.454
and I would love it
if you would go with me.

1415
01:07:44.746 --> 01:07:47.748
You're asking me out a week
after I broke up with somebody?

1416
01:07:48.208 --> 01:07:50.434
Look, I'm going to
cut the shit, here.

1417
01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:51.460
Please.

1418
01:07:51.753 --> 01:07:55.148
This is the first time
that you've been single

1419
01:07:55.173 --> 01:07:56.675
in all the years
you've worked here.

1420
01:07:57.342 --> 01:07:59.987
Just go out with me
one time.

1421
01:08:00.012 --> 01:08:01.780
And if you're miserable
and you hate it

1422
01:08:01.804 --> 01:08:06.143
then I promise I will never
even hint at the subject again.

1423
01:08:07.686 --> 01:08:08.686
Please.

1424
01:08:08.936 --> 01:08:10.396
Rex, I don't think
it's smart.

1425
01:08:10.521 --> 01:08:12.708
I'm an asshole,
I know that.

1426
01:08:12.733 --> 01:08:14.126
It worked for me
in high school,

1427
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:15.652
and it's been
a reflex ever since.

1428
01:08:16.110 --> 01:08:18.279
Lori,
the worst that can happen

1429
01:08:18.654 --> 01:08:21.175
is that you go on
a fun, casual date

1430
01:08:21.199 --> 01:08:23.301
with a guy who
just wants a chance

1431
01:08:23.327 --> 01:08:26.889
to prove that he can be
something more than a jerk.

1432
01:08:26.913 --> 01:08:29.307
Plus, you are a huge catch.

1433
01:08:29.332 --> 01:08:31.376
And it's about time someone
treated you that way.

1434
01:08:33.628 --> 01:08:35.631
Fuck it. Fine.

1435
01:08:35.796 --> 01:08:38.065
Fine. It sure as hell beats crying
myself to sleep every night.

1436
01:08:38.091 --> 01:08:40.359
And if that means
getting you off my back,

1437
01:08:40.385 --> 01:08:41.778
well, that's just a bonus.

1438
01:08:41.802 --> 01:08:43.262
I'll pick you up at 8:00.

1439
01:08:50.854 --> 01:08:53.398
Johnny. It's me.

1440
01:08:53.814 --> 01:08:54.858
Go away.

1441
01:08:55.192 --> 01:08:57.903
Johnny, open the door,
please, I want to talk.

1442
01:09:07.621 --> 01:09:09.664
Jesus Christ!
What the fuck, man?

1443
01:09:09.831 --> 01:09:12.042
Sorry. Look, Johnny, I know
you're pissed, all right?

1444
01:09:12.208 --> 01:09:14.211
But just listen to me
for five seconds.

1445
01:09:14.418 --> 01:09:16.646
I saw Lori leaving
the apartment with Rex.

1446
01:09:16.671 --> 01:09:17.730
What?

1447
01:09:17.756 --> 01:09:19.149
I'm serious, John.
I went over to talk to her

1448
01:09:19.173 --> 01:09:20.859
and maybe take some
of the heat off you.

1449
01:09:20.884 --> 01:09:22.319
And there he was,
picking her up.

1450
01:09:22.344 --> 01:09:23.819
They were going
to the Hatch Shell.

1451
01:09:23.845 --> 01:09:25.822
You're fucking unbelievable,
you know that?

1452
01:09:25.846 --> 01:09:27.490
How stupid
do you think I am?

1453
01:09:27.515 --> 01:09:29.076
If you think that by
making shit like that up

1454
01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:31.118
you're going to make me choose
some kind of loyalty to you

1455
01:09:31.144 --> 01:09:32.371
over her you're out
of your fucking mind.

1456
01:09:32.395 --> 01:09:34.622
Johnny, it's the truth,
I'm telling you.

1457
01:09:34.648 --> 01:09:36.565
You know what?
Get out of here.

1458
01:09:37.525 --> 01:09:39.944
You know what? You're acting like a cock.
You know that?

1459
01:09:40.112 --> 01:09:41.587
What? I'm acting
like a cock?

1460
01:09:41.613 --> 01:09:42.672
Yes, you are.

1461
01:09:42.698 --> 01:09:44.882
So shut your meat hole for
a second and listen to me.

1462
01:09:44.908 --> 01:09:46.467
Huh?
Meat hole? What?

1463
01:09:46.493 --> 01:09:48.036
That's not right,
is it? No.

1464
01:09:48.203 --> 01:09:50.012
"Pudding hole"?
Is that what they say?

1465
01:09:50.037 --> 01:09:51.162
No, it can't be
that either.

1466
01:09:51.372 --> 01:09:54.626
Because, "How can you have any
pudding if you don't eat your meat?"

1467
01:09:54.792 --> 01:09:56.962
Right? Pink Floyd.

1468
01:09:57.128 --> 01:09:59.021
Look, the point is,
you're blaming me

1469
01:09:59.046 --> 01:10:00.798
for something that
you did to yourself.

1470
01:10:01.466 --> 01:10:02.676
Lori was right about you.

1471
01:10:02.842 --> 01:10:06.470
You cannot take responsibility for
anything that goes on in your life.

1472
01:10:06.637 --> 01:10:07.738
Oh, and you can?

1473
01:10:07.764 --> 01:10:10.016
I don't have to.
I'm a fucking teddy bear.

1474
01:10:10.475 --> 01:10:13.703
You know something? I didn't tie
you up and drag you to that party.

1475
01:10:13.729 --> 01:10:16.747
I wanted you to come because
you're supposedly my best friend.

1476
01:10:16.773 --> 01:10:18.000
You can't stand there
and tell me

1477
01:10:18.024 --> 01:10:20.127
that you haven't always seen Lori
as a threat to our friendship.

1478
01:10:20.152 --> 01:10:21.586
It works out
so much better for you

1479
01:10:21.610 --> 01:10:22.962
when you and I are
getting fucked up

1480
01:10:22.988 --> 01:10:24.238
on the couch at 9:00
A.M., doesn't it?

1481
01:10:24.530 --> 01:10:25.614
Listen to yourself.

1482
01:10:25.782 --> 01:10:28.327
What am I? Emperor Ming,
here, controlling your mind?

1483
01:10:28.493 --> 01:10:30.078
That's your choice, John.

1484
01:10:30.287 --> 01:10:32.055
And by blaming me,
you, you're just

1485
01:10:32.079 --> 01:10:33.707
making yourself
look like a pussy.

1486
01:10:36.335 --> 01:10:38.145
Sometimes I think back to
that Christmas morning

1487
01:10:38.170 --> 01:10:39.395
when I was eight years old.

1488
01:10:39.421 --> 01:10:41.131
I wish I had just
gotten a Teddy Ruxpin.

1489
01:10:42.716 --> 01:10:44.259
Say that one more time.

1490
01:10:44.676 --> 01:10:47.554
Teddy Rux-fucking-pin!

1491
01:11:10.827 --> 01:11:11.912
Shit!

1492
01:11:16.166 --> 01:11:17.250
Fuck, man!

1493
01:12:02.128 --> 01:12:03.796
Fuck! Cocksucker!

1494
01:12:05.131 --> 01:12:06.841
Fucking stop! Fuck!

1495
01:12:19.061 --> 01:12:20.271
Why are you crying?

1496
01:12:20.939 --> 01:12:24.234
My dick is squished
by the TV.

1497
01:12:34.118 --> 01:12:35.912
I'm so sorry, Johnny.

1498
01:12:36.121 --> 01:12:37.581
So am I, man.

1499
01:12:38.122 --> 01:12:39.582
I love you.

1500
01:12:39.748 --> 01:12:41.251
I love you, too.

1501
01:12:41.751 --> 01:12:43.086
Listen.

1502
01:12:43.627 --> 01:12:46.212
You got to let me help you make
things right with you and Lori.

1503
01:12:46.422 --> 01:12:48.925
There's no putting things right.
She fucking hates me.

1504
01:12:49.301 --> 01:12:53.012
No, John.
We can get her back.

1505
01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:54.221
Look,

1506
01:12:55.265 --> 01:12:57.350
you remember
when you were 10,

1507
01:12:57.516 --> 01:13:00.145
and you hit that squirrel
with your BB gun?

1508
01:13:00.311 --> 01:13:02.079
And then when we saw
it fall from the tree,

1509
01:13:02.104 --> 01:13:04.149
we both started crying,
you remember?

1510
01:13:04.315 --> 01:13:05.649
And then we ran up to it

1511
01:13:05.774 --> 01:13:09.945
and we tried to give it CPR,
and it came back to life.

1512
01:13:10.113 --> 01:13:12.006
John, we could
do that again.

1513
01:13:12.032 --> 01:13:13.073
Ted,

1514
01:13:13.283 --> 01:13:15.969
we crushed its ribcage and blew out
its lungs trying to give it CPR.

1515
01:13:15.993 --> 01:13:17.162
It died.

1516
01:13:18.371 --> 01:13:21.416
Come on. We're going
to the Hatch Shell.

1517
01:14:10.297 --> 01:14:11.483
Yeah!

1518
01:14:11.507 --> 01:14:13.277
Thanks. We're going to
take a short break,

1519
01:14:13.301 --> 01:14:14.452
but we'll be
back in a few.

1520
01:14:22.601 --> 01:14:24.246
Play <i>Chopsticks,</i>
you jazzy slut.

1521
01:14:24.270 --> 01:14:25.313
Teddy!

1522
01:14:26.648 --> 01:14:27.666
How are you?

1523
01:14:27.690 --> 01:14:29.376
How are you doing,
you fuzzy little asshole?

1524
01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:31.461
Well, I'm not a hot,
half-Muslim chick

1525
01:14:31.485 --> 01:14:34.029
who sold 37 million records,
but I'm hanging in there.

1526
01:14:34.698 --> 01:14:36.173
Half-Indian, but thanks.

1527
01:14:36.198 --> 01:14:37.259
Yeah, whatever.
Thanks for 9/11.

1528
01:14:37.283 --> 01:14:39.344
Listen, I want you to meet a
good pal of mine, all right?

1529
01:14:39.368 --> 01:14:41.179
John Bennett, Norah Jones.

1530
01:14:41.203 --> 01:14:42.846
Hi, Norah Jones.

1531
01:14:42.872 --> 01:14:45.041
Hey, there, sweaty.

1532
01:14:46.710 --> 01:14:48.019
You ready to
bring down the house?

1533
01:14:48.043 --> 01:14:51.273
Yes, ma'am. Thank you for
the opportunity, Miss...

1534
01:14:51.297 --> 01:14:52.300
Ma'am Jones.

1535
01:14:52.324 --> 01:14:53.324
Thank you.

1536
01:14:53.466 --> 01:14:55.051
Jesus, you look fantastic.

1537
01:14:55.342 --> 01:14:57.779
Well, you're probably not used
to seeing me fully clothed.

1538
01:14:57.804 --> 01:15:01.699
I know, I mean, me and Norah met
back in 2002 at this event for

1539
01:15:01.725 --> 01:15:03.560
this charity that we
were both involved with.

1540
01:15:03.685 --> 01:15:05.453
This wonderful charity,
actually, for kids

1541
01:15:05.478 --> 01:15:06.688
who'd been fucked
by a family member.

1542
01:15:06.895 --> 01:15:09.123
And we... We ended up
hooking up in the back room.

1543
01:15:09.149 --> 01:15:11.333
Actually, you weren't so bad
for a guy with no penis.

1544
01:15:11.359 --> 01:15:14.487
You know, I have written so many
angry letters to Hasbro about that.

1545
01:15:17.198 --> 01:15:18.283
Thank you.

1546
01:15:18.449 --> 01:15:20.260
Now, I'm going to
give my chops a rest

1547
01:15:20.284 --> 01:15:21.786
and bring a friend up
to the stage.

1548
01:15:21.953 --> 01:15:24.139
He's going to sing a
song to a special lady

1549
01:15:24.163 --> 01:15:26.332
in the audience
who he loves very much.

1550
01:15:26.498 --> 01:15:29.418
Please give a big hand
to John Bennett.

1551
01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:34.733
Oh, my God.

1552
01:15:34.757 --> 01:15:36.634
Holy shit!

1553
01:15:40.346 --> 01:15:42.181
I gotta fuck her again.

1554
01:15:43.515 --> 01:15:47.020
Hi, my name is John Bennett,

1555
01:15:47.354 --> 01:15:49.355
and this is
for Lori Collins.

1556
01:15:50.314 --> 01:15:51.524
Because I love you.

1557
01:15:52.692 --> 01:15:56.863
This song always reminds me of the
most important night of my life.

1558
01:15:57.947 --> 01:15:59.532
The night we met.

1559
01:15:59.698 --> 01:16:03.536
This is the theme song
from the movie <i>Octopussy.</i>

1560
01:16:08.291 --> 01:16:14.881
<i>All I wanted was a sweet
distraction For an hour or two</i>

1561
01:16:15.715 --> 01:16:20.136
<i>Had no intention to do</i>

1562
01:16:21.345 --> 01:16:23.347
Still better
than Katy Perry.

1563
01:16:26.475 --> 01:16:30.063
<i>Funny how it
always goes with love</i>

1564
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:33.774
<i>When you don't look,
you find</i>

1565
01:16:33.942 --> 01:16:37.862
<i>But then
we're two of a kind</i>

1566
01:16:38.822 --> 01:16:41.073
<i>We move as one</i>

1567
01:16:43.076 --> 01:16:46.078
<i>We're an all time high</i>

1568
01:16:46.453 --> 01:16:47.846
You suck,
get off the stage!

1569
01:16:47.872 --> 01:16:49.416
Come on.
Give him a chance.

1570
01:16:52.252 --> 01:16:55.003
<i>Doing so much more</i>

1571
01:16:55.212 --> 01:16:56.296
You're an asshole!

1572
01:16:56.881 --> 01:16:58.173
<i>Than falling...</i>

1573
01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:03.805
Oh, Jesus!

1574
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:07.057
Someone call an ambulance!

1575
01:17:16.484 --> 01:17:18.127
That was insane.

1576
01:17:18.153 --> 01:17:20.087
Did you see the way the
guy's body hit the ground?

1577
01:17:20.113 --> 01:17:21.738
He was like a ragdoll.

1578
01:17:22.114 --> 01:17:24.175
Yeah, I'd rather
just not talk about it.

1579
01:17:24.199 --> 01:17:25.844
Do you want to go
get a drink after this?

1580
01:17:25.868 --> 01:17:28.846
I feel like I could use one
after seeing a guy almost die.

1581
01:17:28.872 --> 01:17:31.765
No, I think I'd rather just
have you take me home.

1582
01:17:31.791 --> 01:17:33.768
One drink.
Come on.

1583
01:17:33.792 --> 01:17:35.770
No, not really
feeling up to it.

1584
01:17:35.795 --> 01:17:37.689
All right, I get it.

1585
01:17:37.713 --> 01:17:40.774
And, you know,
I don't blame you.

1586
01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.444
I mean,
when you think about it,

1587
01:17:42.469 --> 01:17:45.721
it was actually really unfair of
him to embarrass you like that.

1588
01:17:46.930 --> 01:17:49.391
Just to be clear,
I'm not embarrassed.

1589
01:17:49.809 --> 01:17:52.604
Listen, John and I may have our
problems, but at least he tried.

1590
01:17:54.771 --> 01:17:57.774
You know what? I don't feel
like talking to you about this.

1591
01:17:58.275 --> 01:17:59.359
Where are you going?

1592
01:17:59.527 --> 01:18:02.529
Taking a cab.
I'm going home.

1593
01:18:06.826 --> 01:18:08.203
Finally.

1594
01:18:19.338 --> 01:18:20.606
Down here.

1595
01:18:20.631 --> 01:18:22.358
Not looking up your towel.
Swear to God.

1596
01:18:22.382 --> 01:18:24.925
Not looking up your towel. Not
looking at your funny business.

1597
01:18:25.052 --> 01:18:26.679
Ted, what are you
doing here?

1598
01:18:27.514 --> 01:18:28.847
I need to talk to you.

1599
01:18:29.349 --> 01:18:31.493
Listen, if you're here to fight
John's battles for him...

1600
01:18:31.518 --> 01:18:33.453
Look, just let me
talk first, all right?

1601
01:18:33.478 --> 01:18:35.354
And then you can
say whatever you want.

1602
01:18:39.775 --> 01:18:43.505
Look, John loves
you very much,

1603
01:18:43.529 --> 01:18:45.006
more than
anything in the world,

1604
01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:48.076
and he's falling to fucking
pieces without you.

1605
01:18:48.618 --> 01:18:50.552
He knows
he screwed up huge

1606
01:18:50.578 --> 01:18:54.097
but you've got to believe me,
it wasn't all his fault.

1607
01:18:54.122 --> 01:18:57.894
I told him to bail on you that
night at Rex's and he said, "No."

1608
01:18:57.918 --> 01:19:01.922
He said "no," he was going to stay there
with you, and I twisted his arm, Lori.

1609
01:19:02.422 --> 01:19:04.466
So, if you just give him
one more chance

1610
01:19:05.092 --> 01:19:08.304
I promise I will leave
and I'll never come back.

1611
01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:10.597
All right?
He'll be all yours.

1612
01:19:11.474 --> 01:19:13.493
Ted, that's
a really nice offer,

1613
01:19:13.518 --> 01:19:15.895
but I don't want
you to do that.

1614
01:19:16.061 --> 01:19:20.065
This is between John and me and
I don't think it can be fixed.

1615
01:19:20.233 --> 01:19:21.609
Yeah, because of me!

1616
01:19:21.734 --> 01:19:25.046
Look, Lori,
you want him to be a man.

1617
01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:27.047
But as long as
he's got his teddy bear,

1618
01:19:27.073 --> 01:19:29.199
he's always going to
be a boy.

1619
01:19:31.243 --> 01:19:33.997
He's waiting down
at Charlie's right now.

1620
01:19:34.162 --> 01:19:37.750
So, if you go down there
and just talk to him

1621
01:19:37.917 --> 01:19:39.752
I'll be gone
when you get back.

1622
01:19:40.670 --> 01:19:41.962
Forever.

1623
01:19:42.421 --> 01:19:45.399
And, you'll see,

1624
01:19:45.425 --> 01:19:48.427
he'll never be
scared of thunder again.

1625
01:20:32.137 --> 01:20:35.766
"Michelob Ultra
Tuscan Orange Grapefruit."

1626
01:20:35.932 --> 01:20:38.226
My God,
America is imploding.

1627
01:20:47.278 --> 01:20:48.320
Hi, Ted.

1628
01:20:48.945 --> 01:20:49.988
Fuck!

1629
01:21:09.216 --> 01:21:10.510
Lori, what...

1630
01:21:11.010 --> 01:21:12.052
Hey.

1631
01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:13.429
What are you doing here?

1632
01:21:14.012 --> 01:21:15.847
You can thank Ted.

1633
01:21:19.519 --> 01:21:21.729
Should I sit?

1634
01:21:22.188 --> 01:21:24.231
Yeah, if you want.

1635
01:21:24.481 --> 01:21:25.774
Okay.

1636
01:21:27.859 --> 01:21:29.569
So, work's good?
Everything good, there?

1637
01:21:29.737 --> 01:21:32.239
Yeah. Yeah, work's good.

1638
01:21:34.033 --> 01:21:36.577
I guess we can't make
small talk all day, huh?

1639
01:21:37.869 --> 01:21:41.582
If it's okay with you, I just
want to say what I want to say.

1640
01:21:42.708 --> 01:21:44.310
I could sit here and
tell you I'm sorry,

1641
01:21:44.335 --> 01:21:45.853
it was a huge
misunderstanding,

1642
01:21:45.877 --> 01:21:48.422
and I'm ready to change,

1643
01:21:48.547 --> 01:21:50.672
but I don't think you want
to hear any of that crap.

1644
01:21:51.216 --> 01:21:53.552
I'm not going to try to
get you to take me back.

1645
01:21:54.052 --> 01:21:55.154
Why would you?

1646
01:21:55.179 --> 01:21:57.155
I've been a really shitty boyfriend
for the last four years.

1647
01:21:57.180 --> 01:21:58.807
I don't deserve you.

1648
01:21:59.559 --> 01:22:03.371
I know I didn't take our
relationship seriously but, Lori,

1649
01:22:03.395 --> 01:22:05.230
I do love you more
than life itself.

1650
01:22:07.190 --> 01:22:10.670
All I want is... I just
want to end on good terms.

1651
01:22:10.694 --> 01:22:11.988
I owe that to you.

1652
01:22:12.154 --> 01:22:14.573
I want you to be happy.
You deserve that.

1653
01:22:15.408 --> 01:22:19.369
And I just hope that maybe
we can still be friends.

1654
01:22:21.079 --> 01:22:22.998
Thank you for
being so honest.

1655
01:22:26.085 --> 01:22:28.045
That's pretty much it.

1656
01:22:30.797 --> 01:22:31.923
Thanks for coming by.

1657
01:23:07.627 --> 01:23:10.270
Yeah, as you can see

1658
01:23:10.296 --> 01:23:13.632
you've been a part of our
family for quite some time.

1659
01:23:15.467 --> 01:23:16.778
Welcome home.

1660
01:23:16.802 --> 01:23:18.404
Yeah, it's kind of
funny, actually.

1661
01:23:18.429 --> 01:23:20.806
I got a lot of pictures of
you guys at my house.

1662
01:23:21.056 --> 01:23:22.809
Is he all mine, Daddy?

1663
01:23:23.434 --> 01:23:26.729
Yes, he is, my little winner.
Yes, he is.

1664
01:23:27.104 --> 01:23:29.247
Ted, you've arrived
at a lucky time.

1665
01:23:29.273 --> 01:23:31.024
It's almost
Robert's play hour.

1666
01:23:31.234 --> 01:23:33.668
Yeah, I'm guessing you guys
don't have a PS3.

1667
01:23:33.694 --> 01:23:36.610
I'm guessing you're more of a "wooden
horse with a wig" kind of family.

1668
01:23:37.405 --> 01:23:39.050
Yeah.

1669
01:23:39.074 --> 01:23:40.952
No. Yeah. No.

1670
01:23:41.493 --> 01:23:42.494
Yeah.

1671
01:23:50.043 --> 01:23:52.003
Yeah, see,
there's the guy.

1672
01:23:52.296 --> 01:23:55.800
Now, Ted, you belong to Robert now, okay?
You do as he says.

1673
01:23:55.966 --> 01:23:57.969
You think you're just going to
get away with a kidnapping?

1674
01:23:58.135 --> 01:23:59.529
That's a nice fucking
example you're setting...

1675
01:23:59.554 --> 01:24:00.738
Language!

1676
01:24:00.762 --> 01:24:02.265
Sorry. Sorry.

1677
01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:10.480
You know, Ted,
when I was a little boy,

1678
01:24:12.567 --> 01:24:14.777
I saw you on television.

1679
01:24:14.944 --> 01:24:16.462
And I thought you were
the most amazing,

1680
01:24:16.487 --> 01:24:19.155
most wonderful thing
I'd ever seen. Ever.

1681
01:24:20.283 --> 01:24:25.011
And I asked my dad if I could have
a magical little teddy bear, too.

1682
01:24:25.037 --> 01:24:26.454
And he said, "No."

1683
01:24:26.831 --> 01:24:29.041
Can you just email me
the rest of this story?

1684
01:24:29.417 --> 01:24:31.460
And I was so heartbroken.

1685
01:24:32.168 --> 01:24:34.963
And I promised myself that
if I ever had a son,

1686
01:24:35.131 --> 01:24:40.219
I would never,
ever, ever say no to him.

1687
01:24:42.345 --> 01:24:43.639
Ever.

1688
01:24:43.805 --> 01:24:46.868
Maybe "no" to a Snickers bar every
once in a while wouldn't hurt.

1689
01:24:46.893 --> 01:24:48.895
Me and Ted are going
to be best friends, Daddy.

1690
01:24:49.436 --> 01:24:52.439
Yes, you are,
my little chipmunk.

1691
01:24:56.068 --> 01:24:57.694
Happy playtime.

1692
01:24:59.654 --> 01:25:01.798
Jesus fucking Christ!

1693
01:25:01.823 --> 01:25:03.951
I said a bad word
one time.

1694
01:25:04.743 --> 01:25:06.429
Daddy punished me
for it.

1695
01:25:06.453 --> 01:25:08.706
That's a great story.
I felt like I was there.

1696
01:25:08.914 --> 01:25:10.707
Daddy gave me an ouch.

1697
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.711
Now, I have to
give you an ouch.

1698
01:25:18.757 --> 01:25:21.152
All right, kid, you win.
We'll do it your way.

1699
01:25:21.176 --> 01:25:22.819
What do you want to do?
You want to play a game?

1700
01:25:22.845 --> 01:25:24.322
It's playtime, right?
We'll play a game.

1701
01:25:24.346 --> 01:25:26.323
Yeah, I want to
play a game.

1702
01:25:26.349 --> 01:25:28.451
Good, good. Let's see.
How about we...

1703
01:25:28.475 --> 01:25:30.475
How about we play a little
game of hide and seek?

1704
01:25:30.603 --> 01:25:32.813
I love hide and seek.
I'll hide.

1705
01:25:32.979 --> 01:25:35.207
Now, hang on a sec, there.

1706
01:25:35.231 --> 01:25:38.778
Your dad likes you to show good manners.
Right, Tubby McFat-Fuck?

1707
01:25:39.110 --> 01:25:41.046
Okay. You hide first.

1708
01:25:41.072 --> 01:25:42.213
Great. Fantastic.

1709
01:25:42.238 --> 01:25:45.801
Okay, now you count to 100, and
then you try to find me, okay?

1710
01:25:45.826 --> 01:25:46.868
Okay.

1711
01:25:48.412 --> 01:25:51.082
Do I need to wash my hands
before I play this game?

1712
01:25:51.791 --> 01:25:55.086
No. That's a weird fucking question.
No, just start counting.

1713
01:25:57.212 --> 01:25:59.297
One, two,

1714
01:26:00.173 --> 01:26:03.636
three, four, five,

1715
01:26:04.345 --> 01:26:06.430
six, seven...

1716
01:26:06.596 --> 01:26:08.765
No peeking, now,
or you'll get kid cancer.

1717
01:26:08.932 --> 01:26:12.228
...eight, nine, ten,

1718
01:26:12.895 --> 01:26:16.356
eleven, twelve,
thirteen...

1719
01:27:35.685 --> 01:27:36.729
Hey.

1720
01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:38.521
Hey.

1721
01:27:39.814 --> 01:27:41.108
You walking home
alone, huh?

1722
01:27:41.567 --> 01:27:42.609
Yeah.

1723
01:27:43.944 --> 01:27:45.112
Do you need a lift?

1724
01:27:45.529 --> 01:27:46.671
Oh, I'm okay.

1725
01:27:46.697 --> 01:27:49.365
If I get raped, it'll be my
fault for what I'm wearing.

1726
01:27:50.242 --> 01:27:52.453
Listen, John.

1727
01:27:53.703 --> 01:27:55.956
There's something that I
need to say to you, too.

1728
01:28:11.387 --> 01:28:13.099
Hey.
Hey.

1729
01:28:13.349 --> 01:28:15.016
John, I hope that...

1730
01:28:15.768 --> 01:28:17.936
Listen, I don't want
you to think that...

1731
01:28:21.064 --> 01:28:22.399
Sorry.

1732
01:28:22.899 --> 01:28:25.860
I want us to keep talking
because I think that maybe...

1733
01:28:27.029 --> 01:28:28.130
Go ahead.

1734
01:28:28.154 --> 01:28:29.923
Whoever this is,
it's not a good time.

1735
01:28:29.948 --> 01:28:31.408
John, it's me.
Can you hear me?

1736
01:28:31.908 --> 01:28:34.136
Ted? Listen,
I got to call you back.

1737
01:28:34.161 --> 01:28:36.122
No, John, don't hang up!
I'm in trouble.

1738
01:28:36.538 --> 01:28:37.789
What do you mean?
What kind of trouble?

1739
01:28:37.957 --> 01:28:40.059
They got me. That freaky
guy from the park,

1740
01:28:40.083 --> 01:28:41.810
and that kid who I
think is his son,

1741
01:28:41.836 --> 01:28:43.270
but may also be his lover,
I don't know.

1742
01:28:43.295 --> 01:28:44.630
Slow down.
Where are you?

1743
01:28:46.047 --> 01:28:47.423
I'm not sure, it's...

1744
01:28:48.634 --> 01:28:50.636
Hello? Hello, John?

1745
01:28:52.011 --> 01:28:53.055
Hello?

1746
01:28:53.889 --> 01:28:56.449
You're not a very
polite guest, are you?

1747
01:28:56.475 --> 01:28:57.618
Shit!

1748
01:28:57.643 --> 01:28:59.912
Ted, hello? Ted?

1749
01:28:59.936 --> 01:29:01.313
What's the matter?
Is he okay?

1750
01:29:01.771 --> 01:29:03.481
I don't know.
Where is he?

1751
01:29:03.649 --> 01:29:05.483
I don't know. He just
said he was in trouble.

1752
01:29:06.193 --> 01:29:07.627
Can you call him back?

1753
01:29:07.653 --> 01:29:08.863
No, it's blocked.

1754
01:29:10.029 --> 01:29:11.114
Wait a second.

1755
01:29:15.161 --> 01:29:17.369
Go. Take Columbus to Herald
and get on the expressway.

1756
01:29:21.125 --> 01:29:23.502
You put us in
quite a pickle here.

1757
01:29:23.711 --> 01:29:25.171
We have to go now.

1758
01:29:25.296 --> 01:29:26.713
Yeah. Good idea.

1759
01:29:29.175 --> 01:29:31.176
You F-ing A-hole.

1760
01:29:57.328 --> 01:30:01.556
We tried to make do
with other teddy bears,

1761
01:30:01.582 --> 01:30:03.208
but none of them
were you, Ted.

1762
01:30:07.128 --> 01:30:08.756
Hello, 911?

1763
01:30:08.881 --> 01:30:10.173
I need the police
right away.

1764
01:30:10.341 --> 01:30:12.342
This guy took
my teddy bear.

1765
01:30:13.135 --> 01:30:14.177
Hello?

1766
01:30:17.055 --> 01:30:19.225
Let me out of here,
you crazy bastard!

1767
01:30:20.643 --> 01:30:21.685
I hear the fat kid running.
I hear the fat kid running.

1768
01:30:21.935 --> 01:30:22.994
I hear the fat kid running.
I hear the fat kid running.

1769
01:30:23.020 --> 01:30:25.189
I bet it's hilarious.
Let me out of here!

1770
01:30:25.396 --> 01:30:27.332
I am a citizen of
the United States of America

1771
01:30:27.358 --> 01:30:28.734
and I have rights!

1772
01:30:31.487 --> 01:30:33.029
Robert, seatbelt.

1773
01:30:33.988 --> 01:30:35.865
It should be
right here, somewhere.

1774
01:30:40.162 --> 01:30:41.204
Johnny!

1775
01:30:41.788 --> 01:30:44.291
Stop, stop!
That's them, turn around!

1776
01:30:50.546 --> 01:30:51.590
Stay with them.

1777
01:30:59.555 --> 01:31:00.599
Hang on!

1778
01:31:18.617 --> 01:31:19.909
Back off, Susan Boyle!

1779
01:31:25.123 --> 01:31:27.208
Oh, my God! He's going to jump!
Get closer.

1780
01:31:32.171 --> 01:31:34.007
All right, easy.
Come on, Ted.

1781
01:31:37.594 --> 01:31:38.679
Shit!
Yes!

1782
01:31:38.970 --> 01:31:41.407
Hey, Johnny!
Total <i>T. J. Hooker,</i> right?

1783
01:31:41.431 --> 01:31:42.682
Yes! Fucking-A right!

1784
01:31:46.270 --> 01:31:47.395
Oh, shit!

1785
01:31:52.609 --> 01:31:53.609
Go! Go! Go!

1786
01:32:06.457 --> 01:32:07.750
Daddy!

1787
01:32:09.792 --> 01:32:11.670
Let's see how well
you know these streets.

1788
01:32:13.630 --> 01:32:14.672
Where is he?

1789
01:32:35.485 --> 01:32:36.612
Jesus!

1790
01:32:49.082 --> 01:32:50.333
There he is.
Pull over.

1791
01:33:23.908 --> 01:33:24.952
Where?

1792
01:33:27.037 --> 01:33:28.305
No!

1793
01:33:28.329 --> 01:33:32.417
You can't have
my teddy bear!

1794
01:33:38.881 --> 01:33:40.442
Holy shit.

1795
01:33:40.466 --> 01:33:41.568
Sorry.

1796
01:33:41.592 --> 01:33:43.554
Somebody had to go Joan
Crawford on that kid.

1797
01:33:43.845 --> 01:33:45.389
Come on.

1798
01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:51.228
Ted?

1799
01:33:57.943 --> 01:33:59.069
Oh, my God!

1800
01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:03.323
Shit!

1801
01:34:29.432 --> 01:34:30.475
Jesus.

1802
01:34:30.766 --> 01:34:32.685
Stay here. Just stay there!
No, John!

1803
01:34:43.988 --> 01:34:45.532
You're mine, Ted!

1804
01:34:45.865 --> 01:34:48.426
Screw you, pal.
I belong to John Bennett.

1805
01:34:48.452 --> 01:34:52.122
But I can give you love,
and rocking horses,

1806
01:34:52.747 --> 01:34:54.291
and dancing.

1807
01:34:54.582 --> 01:34:57.043
I think we're very
far apart on this.

1808
01:35:17.396 --> 01:35:19.106
Ted!
Johnny!

1809
01:36:07.154 --> 01:36:08.215
Oh, my God!

1810
01:36:08.239 --> 01:36:09.490
Ted!

1811
01:36:11.784 --> 01:36:12.868
John.

1812
01:36:13.537 --> 01:36:15.372
Lori, get the stuffing.
Get it all.

1813
01:36:20.877 --> 01:36:22.337
Johnny.

1814
01:36:22.546 --> 01:36:24.314
You're going to be okay, buddy.
Do you understand?

1815
01:36:24.338 --> 01:36:25.590
You're going to be fine.

1816
01:36:26.425 --> 01:36:29.569
Jesus, I look like
the robot from <i>Aliens.</i>

1817
01:36:29.594 --> 01:36:31.529
No, look at me, buddy.

1818
01:36:31.555 --> 01:36:33.055
I promise,
you're going to be okay.

1819
01:36:34.307 --> 01:36:36.768
I don't think so. I'm...

1820
01:36:38.770 --> 01:36:39.854
I'm in trouble.

1821
01:36:40.855 --> 01:36:41.898
I need...

1822
01:36:42.399 --> 01:36:43.899
I need to
tell you something.

1823
01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:45.569
What is it?

1824
01:36:47.820 --> 01:36:50.657
Don't ever lose her again.

1825
01:36:51.408 --> 01:36:53.577
She's the most important...

1826
01:36:56.037 --> 01:36:58.372
the most important
part of your life.

1827
01:37:00.375 --> 01:37:03.086
Even more than me.

1828
01:37:04.212 --> 01:37:06.756
She's your
thunder buddy now.

1829
01:37:07.923 --> 01:37:09.760
She's...

1830
01:37:52.676 --> 01:37:54.220
I got it.

1831
01:38:09.985 --> 01:38:12.171
Baby, I don't know if
this is going to work.

1832
01:38:12.197 --> 01:38:13.323
Please, just try.

1833
01:38:23.375 --> 01:38:25.042
Come on, buddy.

1834
01:39:11.547 --> 01:39:13.925
I'm so sorry.

1835
01:39:14.384 --> 01:39:17.220
You did everything
you could.

1836
01:39:17.929 --> 01:39:19.930
I'm so sorry.

1837
01:41:54.336 --> 01:41:55.353
Ted!

1838
01:41:55.377 --> 01:41:56.462
I'm alive, Johnny!

1839
01:41:56.630 --> 01:41:57.689
Oh, my God!

1840
01:41:57.713 --> 01:42:00.007
I'm alive.
Your magical wish worked!

1841
01:42:00.841 --> 01:42:01.885
You're back!

1842
01:42:02.092 --> 01:42:04.029
Yeah, I mean,
when you sewed me up

1843
01:42:04.054 --> 01:42:05.988
you put some of the stuffing
in the wrong places

1844
01:42:06.014 --> 01:42:07.865
so I'm a little fucked up.

1845
01:42:07.890 --> 01:42:10.726
But will you take care of me
forever and ever?

1846
01:42:12.854 --> 01:42:14.913
I'm just kidding you. I
thought it would be funny

1847
01:42:14.939 --> 01:42:16.524
if you thought
I was fucking retarded.

1848
01:42:16.899 --> 01:42:18.068
You asshole!

1849
01:42:18.484 --> 01:42:20.403
Come here, you bastard.

1850
01:42:23.573 --> 01:42:24.948
Welcome back, Ted.

1851
01:42:27.661 --> 01:42:28.703
It was you.

1852
01:42:29.953 --> 01:42:30.997
You did it.

1853
01:42:31.456 --> 01:42:32.832
Son of a bitch!

1854
01:42:33.332 --> 01:42:35.001
You wished for
my life back.

1855
01:42:35.251 --> 01:42:37.545
No. No.

1856
01:42:37.753 --> 01:42:39.546
I wished for my life back.

1857
01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:53.353
I love you.

1858
01:42:53.770 --> 01:42:55.479
I love you, too.

1859
01:42:57.481 --> 01:43:00.417
And I want you to know that,
after last night

1860
01:43:00.443 --> 01:43:03.546
I don't ever want to lose anyone
who matters to me ever again.

1861
01:43:03.570 --> 01:43:05.864
I'm not going to wait any
longer for my life to start.

1862
01:43:06.865 --> 01:43:08.326
Lori,

1863
01:43:09.703 --> 01:43:11.203
will you marry me?

1864
01:43:12.872 --> 01:43:15.625
All I ever wanted
was you, John Bennett.

1865
01:43:20.713 --> 01:43:25.510
<i>And so John, Lori and Ted
lived happily ever after.</i>

1866
01:43:25.801 --> 01:43:30.681
<i>Having discovered at last, that all
they really needed was each other.</i>

1867
01:43:33.016 --> 01:43:36.162
<i>John and Lori were
married in Cambridge</i>

1868
01:43:36.186 --> 01:43:39.481
<i>by a very special
Justice of the Peace.</i>

1869
01:43:40.149 --> 01:43:42.961
By the power vested in me

1870
01:43:42.985 --> 01:43:45.988
by the New York Jets

1871
01:43:46.113 --> 01:43:50.118
and by the united peoples
of the planet Mongo,

1872
01:43:50.243 --> 01:43:54.096
I now pronounce
you man and wife.

1873
01:43:54.122 --> 01:43:56.416
You may kiss the bride,
Johnny.

1874
01:44:14.934 --> 01:44:17.936
Hi. Tom Skerritt.

1875
01:44:18.354 --> 01:44:19.855
Tom Skerritt! Wow!

1876
01:44:20.314 --> 01:44:22.625
Thanks so much for coming.

1877
01:44:22.649 --> 01:44:25.862
My daughter better be alive,
you sick son of a bitch.

1878
01:44:27.029 --> 01:44:30.073
I am so fake-happy
for her.

1879
01:45:17.872 --> 01:45:21.266
You know, Sam, there's only
one way to end a perfect day.

1880
01:45:21.292 --> 01:45:22.310
What's that?

1881
01:45:22.335 --> 01:45:23.478
Flash jump.

1882
01:45:23.502 --> 01:45:25.188
Right.

1883
01:45:25.212 --> 01:45:28.216

1885
01:45:34.305 --> 01:45:38.117

<i>with his roommate,
Brandon Routh.</i>

1896
01:46:09.923 --> 01:46:13.694

<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

1898
01:46:15.262 --> 01:46:19.141

<i>The charges were dropped
when everyone realized</i>

1905
01:46:36.658 --> 01:46:39.162

01:46:39.621 --> 01:46:43.099

substantial amount of weight</i>

1907
