00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,100
Hey, Rocky.
Hi, there, Eddy.

2
00:03:30,105 --> 00:03:31,105
What's happening?

3
00:03:47,249 --> 00:03:51,331
Moish, listen, do me a favor.
I wanna look busy.

4
00:03:51,351 --> 00:03:52,951
Will you have me paged, okay?

5
00:03:53,487 --> 00:03:55,600
Okay, Rocky, any time.

6
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:12,401
Hey, that's nice.

7
00:04:12,422 --> 00:04:14,348
How are you doing?
Got a Tuesday for me?

8
00:04:14,358 --> 00:04:16,700
I'm booked solid the whole month.
One Tuesday.

9
00:04:16,703 --> 00:04:18,310
Haven't you got a Friday?

10
00:04:18,318 --> 00:04:20,153
I'm not kidding you. I'm booked.

11
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:22,987
Everybody's booked solid
so how come nobody's working, huh?

12
00:04:23,008 --> 00:04:24,008
Rocky Papasano

13
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,546
Excuse me, I got a page.

14
00:04:26,556 --> 00:04:29,092
I want to talk to you.

15
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,857
All right, all right.
You want a wedding?

16
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:34,967
Tuesday?
Tonight.

17
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,190
No, Joe. All I got is just one...

18
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:39,550
Beautiful. You got you got.
Forget it. I'll get somebody else.

19
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,801
Hey, for you I'll change my whole schedule.

20
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:44,920
He's booked solid.

21
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,200
Where's Mitchell Gilmore?
Across the street.

22
00:04:48,203 --> 00:04:50,657
Friedman?
Upstairs.

23
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,638
The usual arrangement, right?

24
00:04:55,158 --> 00:04:56,158
Right.

25
00:04:57,315 --> 00:04:59,332
Boy, how do you do it?

26
00:04:59,352 --> 00:05:02,874
Last time I worked I don't remember.
Was it April or May.

27
00:05:02,884 --> 00:05:05,420
Hey, Rocky, Rocky. They're paging you.

28
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,880
Yeah, Moish, thanks, I heard it.

29
00:05:06,888 --> 00:05:09,512
No, it's a real one. I didn't do it yet.

30
00:05:09,537 --> 00:05:10,742
Hi, Marge.

31
00:05:13,452 --> 00:05:16,701
Great. Stay there, don't move.
Stay right there.

32
00:05:24,617 --> 00:05:27,768
Hey, you got a call for me?
Some broad's paging you.

33
00:05:27,778 --> 00:05:29,578
On the phone?

34
00:05:31,096 --> 00:05:34,062
No, she's around here somewhere.
A little broad.

35
00:05:42,782 --> 00:05:43,782
Hey.

36
00:05:50,682 --> 00:05:52,011
Are you the one that paged me?

37
00:05:53,522 --> 00:05:54,522
Yeah.

38
00:06:01,676 --> 00:06:03,576
Oh, hum... humm...

39
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:05,554
You don't remember who I am, do you?

40
00:06:06,264 --> 00:06:08,879
Yeah, it was in a dance in Brooklyn
this summer.

41
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:11,119
In The Mountains, right?

42
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:13,022
It was a dance in The Mountains
What to you mean I don't remember?

43
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,726
It doesn't matter.

44
00:06:14,736 --> 00:06:17,636
My name's Angela.
Can I talk to you a minute?

45
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:19,702
I'm on my lunch hour.
I only got a minute.

46
00:06:21,912 --> 00:06:23,112
Sure, honey.

47
00:06:26,681 --> 00:06:27,975
I'm gonna have a baby.

48
00:06:36,785 --> 00:06:38,315
Congratulations.

49
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:45,200
Don't worry. I'm not gonna cause
you any trouble.

50
00:06:47,904 --> 00:06:50,300
All I want from you is a doctor.

51
00:06:50,308 --> 00:06:52,350
An address, you know?

52
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:04,970
Wait, look, you just don't walk
in a place like this and uh...

53
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,750
Oh, forget it.

54
00:07:14,051 --> 00:07:15,700
Wait... wait...

55
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,013
Listen... you just don't...

56
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:27,000
You just don't walk up to a guy and
tell him something like that.

57
00:07:27,002 --> 00:07:28,068
Finished.

58
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,558
Come on and I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

59
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:38,770
Hey, hey...

60
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,790
Look!

61
00:07:40,177 --> 00:07:42,060
I didn't think you'd give a damn
one way or the other.

62
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,300
But I did hope that you'd...

63
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,350
Look, will you...
Look.

64
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,351
Wait a minute.

65
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:02,251
Where can I get a hold of you?

66
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:04,630
Macy's.
Nine to five.

67
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,003
Fifth floor.

68
00:08:27,117 --> 00:08:30,217
I'm going as fast as I can!
Take it easy, take it easy.

69
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:33,419
Now stop. Knock it off.

70
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,110
That's right.
Nice, behave. Come on.

71
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,500
Knock it off, shorty.

72
00:08:50,018 --> 00:08:53,014
Get outta here.
Come on, get away.

73
00:08:53,025 --> 00:08:54,560
Gonna get hair all over me.

74
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:00,800
Come on, ugly.

75
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:03,237
Ugly? Who are you calling ugly?

76
00:09:03,947 --> 00:09:06,220
Him, the ugliest dog I ever saw.

77
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,449
He is not.
Don't you listen to him, sweetie

78
00:09:10,469 --> 00:09:14,369
He's a naughty, naughty man,
yes he is, baby.

79
00:09:34,494 --> 00:09:36,723
Where were you this morning
to wake up at dawn?

80
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:38,312
I told you.

81
00:09:38,994 --> 00:09:40,504
The Union Hall.

82
00:09:41,725 --> 00:09:42,725
I forgot.

83
00:09:47,246 --> 00:09:48,632
Wish I'd forgotten.

84
00:09:52,043 --> 00:09:54,143
Ethan, eat your breakfast.

85
00:09:56,153 --> 00:09:58,911
All right, now. Eat your eggs...
For protein.

86
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:07,930
What are you doing? Selling protein?

87
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,113
Don't start up with me?

88
00:10:15,038 --> 00:10:17,143
Is it my fault you couldn't find work?

89
00:10:17,163 --> 00:10:20,478
Who couldn't find work?
I got a wedding tonight,
tonight in the Bronx.

90
00:10:20,488 --> 00:10:24,100
Don't take it out on me.
Taking what out on you?

91
00:10:25,203 --> 00:10:27,774
Look, anytime you're not happy with the

92
00:10:27,782 --> 00:10:32,172
hospitality at my apartment,
use the deposit back on your key.

93
00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:36,300
Aw, come on, will you?

94
00:10:38,506 --> 00:10:40,061
I'm dying.

95
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:41,932
My shirt is sweated right through.

96
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:44,830
My bones ache.

97
00:10:45,348 --> 00:10:47,019
And my head's killing me.

98
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:56,800
Are you okay, honey?

99
00:10:56,806 --> 00:10:59,206
You feel warm.

100
00:11:03,022 --> 00:11:04,722
I thought you were dying.

101
00:11:04,863 --> 00:11:07,996
What's the matter?
Jane Russell would do it for Billy the Kid.

102
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:13,278
My luck to wind up with a sex maniac.

103
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:19,400
You good?

104
00:11:19,407 --> 00:11:20,407
Yeah.

105
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:28,057
You know me in the cold weather,
how I love to be in love.

106
00:11:28,877 --> 00:11:30,830
We are in love, aren't we?

107
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,127
Really in love.

108
00:11:35,147 --> 00:11:36,147
Yeah...

109
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:38,945
You with yourself...

110
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,200
and me with myself.

111
00:11:53,607 --> 00:11:55,359
Wanna hear your horoscope?

112
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:56,369
Today?

113
00:11:57,079 --> 00:11:59,904
Stars in the wrong orbit, play it cool,
lock yourself in the toilet

114
00:11:59,914 --> 00:12:01,214
and don't come out.

115
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,541
All right...

116
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,610
What happened today?

117
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:08,342
Nothing happened.
Oh, obvious.

118
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,016
What happened, nothing happened.

119
00:12:11,326 --> 00:12:14,512
Great day. Marvelous day.

120
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,634
What a I going to tell you?
I'm sick and tired of that...

121
00:12:24,674 --> 00:12:26,633
kind of life I lead.

122
00:12:40,453 --> 00:12:41,453
Barb...

123
00:12:44,478 --> 00:12:45,670
Hey, Barb...

124
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,960
Hm-hmm...

125
00:12:49,578 --> 00:12:51,890
A friend of mine asked me if I'd ask you

126
00:12:51,898 --> 00:12:54,200
if you knew the name of maybe a kind of
doctor or something.

127
00:12:58,918 --> 00:13:01,065
He's got himself in a little trouble
with a girl.

128
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,475
Hey, Barb...

129
00:13:14,796 --> 00:13:18,260
You want me to find you a doctor?

130
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,730
You want me to find you a doctor?

131
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,350
Now wait a minute, I didn't...

132
00:13:53,317 --> 00:13:54,317
Angie!

133
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,340
Angie!

134
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:58,235
Angie!

135
00:13:58,764 --> 00:14:00,454
Hey, Angie, over here!

136
00:14:04,668 --> 00:14:05,668
Come on.

137
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:18,104
What are you looking. We happened to pass
by you in the neighborhood

138
00:14:18,247 --> 00:14:19,971
so what's so terrible to give you
a ride home?

139
00:14:19,981 --> 00:14:21,906
It's embarrassing the fruit truck
all the time.

140
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,416
Excuse me very much, your highness,

141
00:14:23,426 --> 00:14:25,152
When I start hauling vegetables in a limousine

142
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,951
I'll pick you up in a limousine.

143
00:14:32,361 --> 00:14:35,444
All right, I grant you that time
you went to the dance and everything...

144
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,027
you were all dressed up and everything.

145
00:14:37,047 --> 00:14:38,990
I can see maybe you don't want
to ride in a truck.

146
00:14:38,995 --> 00:14:41,660
But now you got on your regular clothes
in the daytime.

147
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,270
You're right, Dominic,
what can I tell you?

148
00:14:44,392 --> 00:14:45,676
When you're right, you're right.

149
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:48,325
Go talk to her lately,
anything you say.

150
00:14:48,335 --> 00:14:50,235
Drive, will you, drive!
I got a date tonight.

151
00:14:50,336 --> 00:14:53,701
She won't run away, I guarantee you.
Miss skin and bones.

152
00:14:55,216 --> 00:14:57,026
Going out tonight, Angie?

153
00:14:57,051 --> 00:14:58,051
Why?

154
00:14:59,652 --> 00:15:01,163
Why, I'm making conversation.

155
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,136
All right, who did you happen
to bump into today?

156
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:08,477
What're you talking, will ya?
Nobody?

157
00:15:08,888 --> 00:15:11,464
Tell her, Julie, what happened.
Did I do anything? Tell her.

158
00:15:12,284 --> 00:15:14,693
We bumped into, what's his name, Columbo.

159
00:15:15,403 --> 00:15:16,746
Columbo.

160
00:15:16,756 --> 00:15:18,465
Columsy!

161
00:15:18,475 --> 00:15:20,151
Is that nice?
Why do you call a person names?

162
00:15:20,171 --> 00:15:23,160
Clumsy, Clumsy. He can't turn around
without banging into something.

163
00:15:23,204 --> 00:15:24,809
Who wouldn't be clumsy the way
you look at him?

164
00:15:24,908 --> 00:15:26,117
Make 'im nervous.

165
00:15:26,127 --> 00:15:28,900
Anyhow, we met him on the street.
Did we meet him on the street, Julie?

166
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:30,257
We met him on the street.

167
00:15:31,007 --> 00:15:33,610
He said: how is Angie?

168
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,922
I said, fine.

169
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:38,184
He said, maybe I'll drop by the house sometime.
I said, fine.

170
00:15:38,194 --> 00:15:40,278
He said, maybe tonight.
I said, fine...

171
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,319
wonderful that you'd like to see him.
That's the whole thing.

172
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,802
I told you, Dominic,
if you don't stop with this...

173
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:46,829
What you telling me?
The fella's coming over to the house.

174
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:48,363
What should I tell him?
You'd hate to see him?

175
00:15:48,383 --> 00:15:49,525
I'm not gonna see him!

176
00:15:53,435 --> 00:15:54,535
Why don't you like him?

177
00:15:54,763 --> 00:15:57,227
A nice boy, responsible,
a nice little business of his own.

178
00:15:57,237 --> 00:15:59,388
I like him, I like him. I love him.

179
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,732
He's Prince Charming, I'm crazy about him.

180
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:04,024
Hey, you! Don't party in the kitchen.

181
00:16:04,044 --> 00:16:06,688
It's a dance.
In a nightclub dance, in the kitchen eat.

182
00:16:06,698 --> 00:16:08,911
You can't keep him home.
This one looks like an old lady.

183
00:16:08,922 --> 00:16:11,214
Why does it bother you?
What's it your business?

184
00:16:11,224 --> 00:16:13,390
If I wanna stay home,
if I wanna blow bubbles,

185
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:15,933
I have a right to do what I like.
That's what I like to do.

186
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,932
Like? In America everybody wants
to do what they like.

187
00:16:18,942 --> 00:16:21,266
What do they like?
They don't know what they like.

188
00:16:21,277 --> 00:16:24,108
She's waiting in the store
for a movie star
on a big white horse.

189
00:16:24,118 --> 00:16:26,670
Mr Charming. Boy, a prince.

190
00:16:26,674 --> 00:16:29,530
What does she want?
A movie star, she wants? On a horse?

191
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,740
Right, Angie?
Exactly.

192
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:33,200
Is that all right with you, Ma?

193
00:16:33,205 --> 00:16:35,400
For me? As long as he's Catholic.

194
00:16:35,406 --> 00:16:39,074
Hey, Angie.
In the old days a young person had respect.

195
00:16:39,094 --> 00:16:42,078
In the old days, you didn't have to like everything.

196
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:43,358
You did what you had to do

197
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:45,565
and if you didn't like it
you liked it anyway.

198
00:16:45,575 --> 00:16:47,237
Take me, for example.

199
00:16:47,247 --> 00:16:50,255
I met your papa, rest his soul,
on a Sunday, eh?

200
00:16:50,266 --> 00:16:51,760
And on Tuesday you were married.

201
00:16:51,763 --> 00:16:56,000
Yes. And what do I have,
such a terrible life for 32 years?

202
00:16:56,008 --> 00:16:57,550
I hate to remind you about this,

203
00:16:57,554 --> 00:16:59,900
but today is not the Dark Ages
when you were a little girl.

204
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:03,402
Okay, today is the Light Ages, sure.

205
00:17:03,412 --> 00:17:08,177
Ah, questa campanella...
All right, vengo, vengo.

206
00:17:12,597 --> 00:17:14,135
I'm not here. That's all.

207
00:17:14,745 --> 00:17:16,747
Angie! It's not nice.

208
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:21,241
Hey, look who's here. How are you?
I was just in the neighborhood...

209
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:23,150
Hi Tommy, nice to see you.
How are you doing?

210
00:17:23,156 --> 00:17:25,820
Wait a minute, I'm going to get Angie.

211
00:17:26,528 --> 00:17:29,729
Angie, will you come on out.
Oh, for crying out loud!

212
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:32,243
Can't I have any privacy in my house
even in the bathroom?

213
00:17:32,253 --> 00:17:33,930
Is it gonna kill you just to say hello to him?

214
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,540
Dominic, I've told you 400 times...
What did you tell me, what?

215
00:17:37,574 --> 00:17:39,063
Hey, will you get out there and...
get out!

216
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:43,750
I've lived my whole life in this house
and never
had a corner where I could put a turtle.

217
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,600
To put a cat or a little turtle.

218
00:17:45,612 --> 00:17:47,128
Turtle, what turtle?
You want a turtle?

219
00:17:47,138 --> 00:17:51,359
I want a room of my own.
What are you telling me?
You want a turtle, buy a turtle.

220
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:53,824
It's my own fault. It's me.

221
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:55,710
I'm a big girl, I make my own money.

222
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,046
Who says I have to live here
if I don't wanna live here?

223
00:17:58,056 --> 00:17:59,254
And I don't wanna live here.

224
00:17:59,305 --> 00:18:01,127
I'm gonna move out of this house tonight.

225
00:18:01,137 --> 00:18:02,600
This time I really mean it.

226
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:05,926
Hey, look who's here. Mr Columbo is here.
I'm sorry, I mean uh...

227
00:18:05,946 --> 00:18:09,138
you know, excuse me for dropping in.
I just happened to be in the...

228
00:18:09,158 --> 00:18:11,586
We're gonna have some coffee.
Come on, Angie,
let's have a cup of coffee.

229
00:18:11,596 --> 00:18:13,513
... I was in the neighborhood...

230
00:18:13,523 --> 00:18:16,469
Darn it! Would you mind if I turn
the water off?

231
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:20,537
Come on, sit down.
You're just in time for a cup.

232
00:18:20,547 --> 00:18:21,910
Oh, no, really, I couldn't.
I just...

233
00:18:21,918 --> 00:18:23,580
How's your mother?
Oh, she...

234
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,590
Sit down.

235
00:18:24,786 --> 00:18:25,786
Bye-bye everybody.

236
00:18:26,543 --> 00:18:27,943
Have fun.

237
00:18:28,152 --> 00:18:31,001
Don't put a dent on that truck
or I'll break your head.

238
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:35,324
I didn't see her all week.
So I seen your sister and I asked her.

239
00:18:35,334 --> 00:18:37,761
She tells me it's a virus or something?
Yeah...

240
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:40,401
Poor thing,
everyday it's something new, eh?

241
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,813
They couldn't, you know, find anything...

242
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:46,164
they took all the tests,
but she still got this, you know... pain

243
00:18:46,174 --> 00:18:47,831
Come on, sit down.
I'll get you a cup of coffee.

244
00:18:47,841 --> 00:18:50,025
And your other sister, how is she?
Is she out of the hospital?

245
00:18:50,035 --> 00:18:52,210
Oh, next week, I think, well, you know...

246
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,079
Ask him would he like
a piece of cake or something.

247
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:58,401
Would you like a piece of cake or something?
No, no, I just came... Ooh!

248
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:01,023
It's okay, it's okay.
Oh, che peccato. Presto una spugna.

249
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:02,860
It's all right.
Spero non si ai brusciatto.

250
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:04,949
No, no, it's...

251
00:19:10,263 --> 00:19:12,825
It's all right. Una più, una meno.

252
00:19:14,035 --> 00:19:16,760
Angie!
It's nothing.

253
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,480
I'll fix it.

254
00:19:20,109 --> 00:19:22,244
So, how's everything in the
restaurant business?

255
00:19:22,255 --> 00:19:26,028
You know, one day it's pretty good
and the next it's...

256
00:19:26,048 --> 00:19:29,147
uh, you know, it's...

257
00:19:29,247 --> 00:19:32,221
Oh, look, let me do that.
You'll cut your finger...
No, no.

258
00:19:32,231 --> 00:19:33,231
I'll fix it.

259
00:19:36,004 --> 00:19:39,826
Hey, Dominic, we go in the other room
and we close the door.

260
00:19:40,536 --> 00:19:43,253
On the couch I wouldn't trust them
five minutes,
but in the kitchen...

261
00:19:43,273 --> 00:19:45,200
what can happen?
Andiamo, va...

262
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,355
Why don't you sit down?

263
00:19:51,365 --> 00:19:54,213
Just... sit down.

264
00:19:59,003 --> 00:20:00,800
If I sit down,
I'll probably break the chair.

265
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,000
I don't know what it is.

266
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,000
You oughta see me during the day, I...

267
00:20:06,016 --> 00:20:09,910
I got 15 hamburgers going,
I got franks in the grill...

268
00:20:10,728 --> 00:20:12,600
white down, wheat down...

269
00:20:13,202 --> 00:20:15,522
scramble a pair in a skillet.

270
00:20:17,537 --> 00:20:19,729
I don't know.
With this hand I'm breaking lettuce

271
00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:25,355
I just don't know what it is.
All you have to do is just look at me and...

272
00:20:28,866 --> 00:20:29,966
What's the matter?

273
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:34,819
What happened?

274
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,192
Look, I...

275
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:39,930
I better ask you what I...

276
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,300
You know...

277
00:20:41,316 --> 00:20:43,889
Well, I... Anyhow, the thing is...

278
00:20:43,899 --> 00:20:46,560
they're having this dance, you know...

279
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,880
like a dance...

280
00:20:47,885 --> 00:20:50,322
over ate the Sons of Garibaldi...

281
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,188
and I thought that uh...

282
00:20:53,098 --> 00:20:56,516
Well, you probably got a date already,
probably.

283
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:00,900
This Saturday night?

284
00:21:03,156 --> 00:21:04,156
This Saturday?

285
00:21:05,183 --> 00:21:06,483
Tomorrow night?

286
00:21:08,591 --> 00:21:10,416
I knew it. Well...

287
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:12,550
Listen, it's uh...

288
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:18,600
Good night, everybody, I gotta...
Where are you going? What's your hurry?

289
00:21:18,607 --> 00:21:21,731
Listen, with the kind of help
you got to put up with these days...

290
00:21:21,741 --> 00:21:23,854
you're out of business in a couple of hours.

291
00:21:23,954 --> 00:21:26,850
I'll see you, Dom, Julie.
It's good to see you, Mrs Rossini.

292
00:21:26,884 --> 00:21:27,884
Come again soon, eh?

293
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:33,491
Listen, I'm sorry about...
Oh, that's okay.

294
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:36,858
Next time.
Listen, what are you doing New year's Eve?

295
00:21:36,868 --> 00:21:38,350
It's only nine months away.

296
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,550
I'm kidding you.

297
00:21:40,564 --> 00:21:42,939
I'm joking. It's a big joke, huh?

298
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:44,900
I'm a big comedian.

299
00:21:45,402 --> 00:21:47,102
Well...

300
00:21:50,488 --> 00:21:52,288
Good night, Angie.

301
00:21:52,341 --> 00:21:53,831
Good night, Anthony.

302
00:22:40,745 --> 00:22:42,735
What are you doing?

303
00:22:42,992 --> 00:22:44,552
Where are you going?

304
00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:46,549
I'm old enough.

305
00:22:47,253 --> 00:22:50,518
Hey, will you stop that.
No, no, let her go.

306
00:22:50,528 --> 00:22:55,710
You wanna go? Go.
How many years have I got left
in this world?

307
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,473
Go, go, be happy.
Mamma, she don't mean it.

308
00:22:58,483 --> 00:23:00,583
I mean it! I mean it!

309
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:04,543
Go, be a mother in America.
Day and night you watch her,
day and night.

310
00:23:04,553 --> 00:23:06,244
You take her here, you meet her there.

311
00:23:06,265 --> 00:23:08,019
Your whole life you're waiting in the truck

312
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,939
afraid maybe some lunatic
might grab her in the street.

313
00:23:11,004 --> 00:23:15,000
For what? So that she go in the room
with a movie star on a horse?

314
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:16,626
I don't know. I tell you the truth.

315
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,940
On papa's grave
I don't understand what's so terrible.

316
00:23:18,952 --> 00:23:21,688
What should I say? Go in the street?
Who cares about you?

317
00:23:21,698 --> 00:23:24,676
I care about you. Do me something.
I love you.

318
00:23:24,677 --> 00:23:26,290
Don't love me so much.

319
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,288
Hey, America...
I can't breathe.

320
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:30,352
How can I tell you?

321
00:23:30,362 --> 00:23:32,290
Even if I didn't wanna do anything crazy.

322
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,013
Once, just once, I have to.

323
00:23:34,023 --> 00:23:37,411
I really have to, just to keep from...
choking to death.

324
00:23:37,422 --> 00:23:41,204
Every night he goes out with all kinds of...
Guido, Guido, Guido's a boy.

325
00:23:41,214 --> 00:23:42,614
Who cares what he does?

326
00:23:42,868 --> 00:23:46,942
Angelina, bella mia,
I love you.

327
00:23:46,962 --> 00:23:48,441
All right, too much.

328
00:23:48,451 --> 00:23:50,628
Go, go in the world by yourself
in a room.

329
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:52,677
Go, eat in a drugstore by yourself.

330
00:23:52,687 --> 00:23:54,760
If that's want you want to make you happy,

331
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,600
find yourself with strangers?

332
00:23:56,604 --> 00:23:57,604
Go!

333
00:24:13,181 --> 00:24:14,690
I'll go see her tomorrow.

334
00:24:16,094 --> 00:24:17,278
We'll have a talk.

335
00:24:17,288 --> 00:24:19,133
I'll find out what's the matter.

336
00:24:20,943 --> 00:24:21,930
Take her out to lunch.

337
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,900
Actually, you know, this looks orange.

338
00:25:35,941 --> 00:25:38,321
Yeah, they call it rust.

339
00:25:38,332 --> 00:25:41,601
Well, you never can tell what
the manufacturer's going to say.

340
00:25:43,312 --> 00:25:45,429
I wonder if you could show me
something else.

341
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:48,660
Oh, yeah.
Thank you, I'd appreciate that.

342
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,670
Hi.

343
00:25:59,699 --> 00:26:00,841
What are you doing here?

344
00:26:01,551 --> 00:26:03,434
What am I doing here?

345
00:26:05,044 --> 00:26:07,240
Would you excuse me one moment, please?

346
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,829
You know how many people
are on the fifth floor at Macy's?

347
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:24,955
That's all you told me, Macy's,
fifth floor.

348
00:26:24,966 --> 00:26:29,314
I'm sorry. I thought I told you.
Fifth floor you told, that's all, you know.

349
00:26:29,324 --> 00:26:30,324
I'm sorry.

350
00:26:30,611 --> 00:26:34,411
Pretty, pretty tweety.
C'mon, bite my finger.

351
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:49,242
Look, all I came to say was I made you
an appointment Sunday afternoon

352
00:26:49,252 --> 00:26:51,600
and I got you a doctor, okay?

353
00:27:00,001 --> 00:27:04,212
I'll write down the address and,
if you want, it's $400.

354
00:27:07,522 --> 00:27:08,701
Got a piece of paper?

355
00:27:14,511 --> 00:27:16,117
Four hundred dollars.

356
00:27:17,727 --> 00:27:19,477
How much can you raise?

357
00:27:23,187 --> 00:27:26,007
Maybe two at the most.

358
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:29,917
Yeah...

359
00:27:43,601 --> 00:27:46,333
You raise half and I'll try to raise half.

360
00:27:46,338 --> 00:27:47,338
Okay?

361
00:27:48,051 --> 00:27:49,990
I don't know anything about this guy...

362
00:27:49,994 --> 00:27:52,226
So I'll meet you there 3 o'clock
Sunday afternoon.

363
00:27:55,636 --> 00:27:56,914
Got a piece of paper?

364
00:29:30,027 --> 00:29:31,027
I'm sorry.

365
00:30:29,196 --> 00:30:31,562
Look, if you're not absolutely
sure about this

366
00:30:31,582 --> 00:30:33,104
then, I mean, just...

367
00:32:08,514 --> 00:32:10,401
There's only four here.

368
00:32:10,414 --> 00:32:11,550
You'll need another fifty.

369
00:32:11,557 --> 00:32:14,192
What do you mean, they told me four.
Right, plus fifty for me.

370
00:32:14,203 --> 00:32:15,723
Yeah? Well I don't have it.

371
00:32:18,033 --> 00:32:20,782
Bring it with ya.
Four o'clock.

372
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:22,833
But...
Here's the address.

373
00:32:23,158 --> 00:32:24,750
Third floor, front.

374
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:28,501
Yeah, but what happens if I...
Five minutes late, don't bother coming.

375
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:32,290
But what happens if I can't go...
Wait a minute!

376
00:32:59,195 --> 00:33:00,566
He says another fifty.

377
00:33:00,576 --> 00:33:01,576
What?

378
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:26,211
I got thirteen. How much you got?

379
00:33:32,621 --> 00:33:34,763
I think I have about...

380
00:33:34,773 --> 00:33:37,173
eleven. And some change.

381
00:33:41,081 --> 00:33:42,823
We got about 45 minutes.

382
00:33:42,853 --> 00:33:44,451
You got any ideas?

383
00:33:48,271 --> 00:33:49,271
C'mon.

384
00:33:50,644 --> 00:33:51,644
Where?

385
00:33:52,827 --> 00:33:54,014
To get the money.

386
00:35:18,942 --> 00:35:20,340
All right, lady, drop the gun.

387
00:35:22,048 --> 00:35:23,500
How're you doing, sexy?

388
00:35:23,665 --> 00:35:25,645
Gimme your face to see.

389
00:35:25,837 --> 00:35:28,312
What's the matter?
Postcard once in a year?

390
00:35:28,332 --> 00:35:29,614
Can't you say hello?

391
00:35:29,624 --> 00:35:31,518
Hm? Give me a kiss.

392
00:35:31,538 --> 00:35:33,738
Come on!

393
00:35:35,337 --> 00:35:38,072
Where do you live now?
Milan or someplace, Africa?

394
00:35:38,092 --> 00:35:41,401
Two minutes, you get on a subway,
you pick up the telephone...

395
00:35:41,411 --> 00:35:44,517
Mamma, mamma, I want you to meet
a friend of mine. Angie...

396
00:35:44,527 --> 00:35:45,527
Rossini.

397
00:35:46,281 --> 00:35:47,281
Hi.

398
00:35:49,374 --> 00:35:50,780
Mamma, she's a friend.

399
00:35:50,787 --> 00:35:54,120
Friend? Who says no?
She's an enemy?

400
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,130
Where's poppa?

401
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:57,044
Where? He's losing the money.

402
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,548
Believe me, they live across the street
by the U.N.

403
00:36:02,558 --> 00:36:05,500
They take everything so serious.
Like my husband.

404
00:36:05,507 --> 00:36:07,918
With the  bunch and game? Goodbye, Charlene.

405
00:36:09,638 --> 00:36:12,267
What do you give me, a dollar?
I tell you what he's gonna say.

406
00:36:12,279 --> 00:36:14,315
"What the damn hell, he's home," watch.

407
00:36:31,835 --> 00:36:33,150
Enrico, take my place.

408
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:36,252
What the damn hell.

409
00:36:36,792 --> 00:36:38,232
He's home.
What did I tell you?

410
00:36:38,252 --> 00:36:40,322
He's got a girlfriend.

411
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:41,770
So what else is new?

412
00:36:42,474 --> 00:36:43,974
Where she work, in a saloon?

413
00:36:44,026 --> 00:36:47,340
Hey!
Poppa...

414
00:36:47,363 --> 00:36:49,743
I'm sorry.
I want you to meet a friend of mine,
Angie Rossini.

415
00:36:49,763 --> 00:36:51,776
Excuse my big mouth.

416
00:36:51,786 --> 00:36:54,000
I didn't know he meant a friend in person.

417
00:36:54,802 --> 00:36:57,103
And what I said about the saloon
is because...

418
00:36:58,011 --> 00:36:59,990
he bring home a girl...

419
00:37:00,337 --> 00:37:01,610
Believe me...

420
00:37:01,618 --> 00:37:05,332
I'd be ashamed to be seen
with the same girl at a party.

421
00:37:05,343 --> 00:37:07,240
Ma questo mascalzone...

422
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,970
he bring her in the house.

423
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:11,741
That was ten years ago and he still
put me on a bike.

424
00:37:11,761 --> 00:37:13,227
How're you doing, pop?

425
00:37:13,237 --> 00:37:16,722
How're you feeling?
Me, like a horse.

426
00:37:17,282 --> 00:37:21,024
Some horse. He's up all night like a horse
coughing from the cigarette.

427
00:37:21,034 --> 00:37:26,075
Shut up! She talk, eh?
Let's take her...
you want something to eat, eh?

428
00:37:26,086 --> 00:37:30,253
A bottle of wine...
Si, si, come on, come with me.

429
00:37:34,163 --> 00:37:35,340
How're you doing?

430
00:37:35,346 --> 00:37:36,346
All right?

431
00:37:38,901 --> 00:37:39,901
Okay.

432
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:49,272
What do you need, a couple of dollars?
Can't I come down just to see you, poppa?

433
00:37:49,292 --> 00:37:53,566
Come on, take it, big shot. Take it.

434
00:37:55,186 --> 00:37:56,818
And don't say anything to your mother.

435
00:38:11,828 --> 00:38:16,203
Angie, come on, I want you to meet
some of my friends.

436
00:38:28,713 --> 00:38:30,074
How're you doing, beautiful?

437
00:38:30,094 --> 00:38:33,111
Nothing, not a cent, not a penny,
nothing.

438
00:38:33,122 --> 00:38:35,091
Did I ask? What did I ask?

439
00:38:35,601 --> 00:38:36,101
Rocky.

440
00:38:37,511 --> 00:38:39,000
How are you?

441
00:38:39,007 --> 00:38:41,450
How've you been?
Good.

442
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,657
I can't believe it.

443
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:44,438
Hey, you seen Beetie?

444
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:46,462
No, I haven't.
She's sitting right over there.

445
00:38:46,473 --> 00:38:49,542
Come on over say hello.
Look, I got a couple of things
I gotta do...

446
00:38:49,642 --> 00:38:51,222
Come on, say hello.

447
00:38:59,742 --> 00:39:01,300
It's been a long time.

448
00:39:01,307 --> 00:39:04,569
Beetie, look who's here.

449
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,291
Hi, Maria...
Maria, come here.

450
00:39:12,001 --> 00:39:13,067
How're you doing?

451
00:39:14,678 --> 00:39:15,678
Great.

452
00:39:18,094 --> 00:39:19,094
You're looking great.

453
00:39:29,101 --> 00:39:31,334
I told you not to climb.

454
00:39:32,518 --> 00:39:33,521
Maria.

455
00:39:33,565 --> 00:39:34,920
Hi.
Hi.

456
00:39:34,929 --> 00:39:36,559
Hey, she's really big.

457
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:39,257
You oughta see my older boy.
He's bigger than me.

458
00:39:39,267 --> 00:39:42,100
My girlfriends are waiting.
Shut up a minute.

459
00:39:42,107 --> 00:39:44,065
This is Rocky Papasano.

460
00:39:44,085 --> 00:39:45,765
We grew up together.

461
00:39:45,766 --> 00:39:47,450
We went to the same school.

462
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,088
Don't you remember the time I said
thought I saw him

463
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,160
on the Lawrence Welk show on television?

464
00:39:52,162 --> 00:39:56,726
Hey, he's been everywhere.
Hollywood, everyplace.

465
00:39:56,736 --> 00:39:57,736
Bye.

466
00:40:03,766 --> 00:40:05,320
Come on eat with us, eh?

467
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,630
Oh, no, no.
Oh, come on.

468
00:40:07,712 --> 00:40:11,110
No, we should stay.
All right, come on.

469
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,759
Aspetta.

470
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:22,631
Mamma, I don't need...
Shut up. If you tell your papa,
I break your face.

471
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:50,024
Oh, no, no.
La signorina prima.

472
00:41:13,035 --> 00:41:14,335
My brother's here.

473
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:17,606
Hm?
My brother's here.

474
00:41:17,616 --> 00:41:18,616
What brother?

475
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:20,033
In the truck.

476
00:41:32,206 --> 00:41:33,206
Mamma...

477
00:41:34,509 --> 00:41:35,509
What happened?

478
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:36,732
I have to go, poppa.

479
00:41:36,742 --> 00:41:37,999
Rocky! Rocky!

480
00:41:51,906 --> 00:41:52,906
Guido, go get him.

481
00:41:53,226 --> 00:41:56,200
What're you standing there?
Go get him, go on!

482
00:43:21,107 --> 00:43:22,307
That did it.

483
00:43:25,503 --> 00:43:27,201
I can't even run anymore.

484
00:43:36,415 --> 00:43:37,837
Brothers now.

485
00:43:38,857 --> 00:43:42,176
Quarter to four we're gonna sneak out
the back way and get a cab.

486
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:08,934
Well, we got the money,
in case you're interested.

487
00:44:26,054 --> 00:44:27,687
Look, I'm gonna leave now.

488
00:44:30,297 --> 00:44:32,000
You don't have to go with me.

489
00:44:32,009 --> 00:44:36,009
I mean it. Just give me the...

490
00:44:36,367 --> 00:44:38,123
address and tell me where
I'm supposed to go.

491
00:44:40,003 --> 00:44:42,738
Sure, I'm going to let you go
up there alone, huh?

492
00:44:46,158 --> 00:44:48,421
You don't have to worry about protecting me.

493
00:45:29,037 --> 00:45:31,320
Why did you go with me that night
in The Mountains?

494
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:32,822
Do you mind if I ask you that?

495
00:45:34,257 --> 00:45:36,901
Let's forget about that.
Will you just forget about it?

496
00:45:38,711 --> 00:45:41,323
How do I know why I did it?
I don't know.

497
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:44,033
I'm just stupid.

498
00:45:44,053 --> 00:45:47,563
It was just a stupid experiment.

499
00:45:47,573 --> 00:45:50,279
The hotel is full of women,
I wind up with Louis Pasteur.

500
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:53,340
Oh, boy, how they build things up.

501
00:45:53,345 --> 00:45:55,365
In the books, in all the movies.

502
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:59,170
How the world comes to an end every
time the flame of your lips touches mine.

503
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:04,693
All I felt was just scared and disgusted
with myself.

504
00:46:09,004 --> 00:46:10,004
Oh, really?

505
00:46:13,278 --> 00:46:14,791
Look, he's insulted.

506
00:46:14,901 --> 00:46:16,501
Don't take it personally.

507
00:46:56,857 --> 00:46:57,857
Thanks.

508
00:47:21,094 --> 00:47:23,215
You uh... you want a little vino?

509
00:47:52,025 --> 00:47:55,200
Man, there's been a lot of vino
under the bridge today.

510
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:56,943
Just think a pair of nights with a girl.

511
00:48:13,253 --> 00:48:14,600
You know the girl at the park?

512
00:48:14,617 --> 00:48:16,447
My friend the big guy's wife?

513
00:48:16,457 --> 00:48:18,054
You wouldn't believe this.

514
00:48:18,074 --> 00:48:20,480
She's two years younger than me.

515
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:22,022
Would you believe that?

516
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:25,487
Man, I hate to come back here.

517
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:32,331
That girl and I,
we used to break a lot of bread together.

518
00:48:35,041 --> 00:48:38,165
Now we look at each other and
we got nothing to say.

519
00:49:32,485 --> 00:49:33,847
That's what love is?

520
00:49:33,857 --> 00:49:35,455
Bells and banjos play?

521
00:49:36,365 --> 00:49:38,073
How they brainwash you.

522
00:49:38,093 --> 00:49:41,329
And here I spend my whole life life like a nut,
waiting for what?

523
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:42,840
A stranger.

524
00:49:44,836 --> 00:49:46,910
Listen, it's possible.

525
00:49:48,006 --> 00:49:49,600
Don't tell me you believe that.

526
00:49:49,608 --> 00:49:51,132
Well, it's a well-known chemical fact.

527
00:49:51,232 --> 00:49:53,215
Some people, you just have to look ate them.
It's kind of kicky.

528
00:49:53,225 --> 00:49:55,302
With other people, chopped liver.

529
00:49:57,712 --> 00:49:59,814
That's true, but...

530
00:50:00,679 --> 00:50:02,679
how come...

531
00:50:02,934 --> 00:50:04,700
You know, my class in high school.

532
00:50:04,708 --> 00:50:07,314
Half a dozen kids,
they couldn't live without each other.

533
00:50:07,326 --> 00:50:09,116
They got married...

534
00:50:10,226 --> 00:50:11,892
and almost everyone of them now...

535
00:50:11,902 --> 00:50:14,465
either they're divorced already
or they're miserable.

536
00:50:16,975 --> 00:50:19,660
Well, let's face it. Ever
take a close look at a married man?

537
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:21,779
Prisoner of Zenda.

538
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,291
Not everybody.

539
00:50:25,301 --> 00:50:27,200
Nine times out of ten.

540
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:31,661
Maybe.

541
00:50:32,255 --> 00:50:33,255
I don't know.

542
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,323
I used to try to pick out the people
who lived alone

543
00:50:36,343 --> 00:50:38,100
in the subway, in the street...

544
00:50:38,904 --> 00:50:43,033
and almost everytime they had those...
I don't know, glassy eyes.

545
00:50:43,053 --> 00:50:44,852
Nothing's living in them.

546
00:50:46,462 --> 00:50:47,562
Right?

547
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:49,870
I don't know.

548
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:51,985
Dead.

549
00:50:58,814 --> 00:51:00,311
What are you looking at me for?

550
00:51:00,322 --> 00:51:01,880
Do I look dead to you?

551
00:51:08,487 --> 00:51:10,041
Couldn't resist it.

552
00:51:22,761 --> 00:51:24,022
I don't know.

553
00:51:50,742 --> 00:51:52,400
Hey, you wanna see something?

554
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,120
Come here.

555
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:02,901
Is that you?
Yeah, you like that haircut?

556
00:52:03,618 --> 00:52:05,972
I kinda like the haircut, but those knickers...

557
00:52:05,982 --> 00:52:07,899
Hey, I was a very cool cat.

558
00:52:10,556 --> 00:52:13,701
It seems very funny putting
you together with a family somehow.

559
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,955
What did you think,
I got hatched out of an egg?

560
00:52:17,665 --> 00:52:19,330
In a way they love you.

561
00:52:19,339 --> 00:52:20,980
What are you talking about love?

562
00:52:21,086 --> 00:52:23,401
What's love about it? They're glad to see me?

563
00:52:23,411 --> 00:52:24,922
They haven't seen me for a long time.

564
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,084
Let me hang around here for a couple of months,

565
00:52:26,094 --> 00:52:28,372
I'll melt right into the wallpaper
just like everybody else.

566
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:33,482
Love, huh?

567
00:53:01,047 --> 00:53:02,660
That's what makes  it rough.

568
00:53:02,665 --> 00:53:04,355
When they love you.

569
00:57:04,008 --> 00:57:05,008
Come in.

570
00:57:07,329 --> 00:57:08,329
Come on.

571
00:57:18,137 --> 00:57:19,137
Come on.

572
00:57:22,377 --> 00:57:24,630
Move.
Come on.

573
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:35,262
Hey, buddy, wait.
You have to wait out here now.

574
00:57:37,972 --> 00:57:39,551
Come on, hurry up.

575
00:57:39,561 --> 00:57:40,561
Get undressed.

576
00:58:53,078 --> 00:58:55,314
Well, come on.

577
00:59:05,007 --> 00:59:06,007
Take it easy.

578
00:59:13,625 --> 00:59:15,150
Are you a doctor?

579
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,836
You said a doctor.

580
00:59:16,847 --> 00:59:18,357
Take it or leave it.

581
00:59:23,067 --> 00:59:24,156
Come on, put your clothes on.

582
00:59:25,576 --> 00:59:27,566
Get your clothes on.
We're gonna get out of here.

583
00:59:27,577 --> 00:59:28,577
Come on.

584
00:59:29,783 --> 00:59:31,300
Come on!
Get your clothes...

585
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:33,770
Come on, get your clothes on and...

586
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:35,080
Come on...

587
00:59:36,029 --> 00:59:37,511
Come on... get your clothes on.

588
00:59:37,522 --> 00:59:40,200
Get your clothes on.
I want you to get out of here.

589
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,163
Get your clothes on. Now!

590
00:59:43,173 --> 00:59:44,771
Get your...

591
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:47,677
Oh, God...
Get your clothes on now.

592
00:59:47,686 --> 00:59:49,126
No...

593
00:59:49,158 --> 00:59:51,905
No, no, no, no!

594
00:59:55,005 --> 00:59:56,901
I'll kill them before they can touch you.

595
00:59:56,713 --> 00:59:57,913
I'll kill them...

596
01:01:31,216 --> 01:01:33,536
It's okay,
it's a friend of mine's apartment.

597
01:01:33,549 --> 01:01:34,937
He works nights.

598
01:01:37,858 --> 01:01:39,266
You need some rest.

599
01:04:53,849 --> 01:04:54,849
Hi.

600
01:05:23,465 --> 01:05:25,553
Now knock it off.
It's been a rough morning.

601
01:05:25,563 --> 01:05:27,048
All right, now. Here, eat.

602
01:05:27,069 --> 01:05:28,739
No, no, that's not yours. Here.

603
01:05:28,749 --> 01:05:30,827
No, no, here's yours.

604
01:05:34,537 --> 01:05:36,200
Don't you believe in knocking?

605
01:05:36,202 --> 01:05:37,411
What are you doing here?

606
01:05:37,421 --> 01:05:39,549
Paying the rent, for one thing.

607
01:05:39,559 --> 01:05:42,469
Which brings me to a little Orphan Annie
you parked here.

608
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,072
Incidentally, without my permission.

609
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:47,451
Number one, which I would not give you,
number two over my dead body.

610
01:05:47,463 --> 01:05:49,177
Take it easy, will you?
I want you to meat a friend of mine.

611
01:05:49,277 --> 01:05:51,563
Dominic Rossini, Barbie Margolies

612
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:53,100
I'm sorry we kinda busted in on you
like this.

613
01:05:53,304 --> 01:05:55,410
Oh...
Where's the girl?

614
01:06:00,418 --> 01:06:02,534
Honey, would you put some coffee on, hm?

615
01:06:21,344 --> 01:06:22,846
Well, it's a lovely day, isn't it?

616
01:06:22,856 --> 01:06:24,957
Angela...
I gotta talk...

617
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:28,700
I have to tell you, Angie, I...

618
01:06:28,705 --> 01:06:31,468
When he told me my whole stomach
turned over on me.

619
01:06:31,489 --> 01:06:34,770
I mean it. I'll tell you the truth,
I can't believe it.

620
01:06:37,374 --> 01:06:38,788
Anyhow, we had a long talk.

621
01:06:38,798 --> 01:06:41,301
And the thing is,
he came to me like a man.

622
01:06:41,314 --> 01:06:43,058
And he's willing to marry you.

623
01:06:52,268 --> 01:06:53,368
Why?

624
01:06:53,473 --> 01:06:56,358
I know you're embarrassed
by the stupid way he put it, but...

625
01:06:56,368 --> 01:06:58,348
I'm not embarrassed. I'd like to know.

626
01:06:58,368 --> 01:07:00,424
What do you mean stupid?
Stupid, you're stupid.

627
01:07:00,434 --> 01:07:02,633
You're calling me stupid?
Why don't you cool it?

628
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:04,124
Will you stop that?

629
01:07:04,134 --> 01:07:06,478
Sit down.
The both of you.

630
01:07:08,189 --> 01:07:09,911
The both of you, will you sit down?

631
01:07:16,922 --> 01:07:18,327
Do you want to get married?

632
01:07:20,137 --> 01:07:21,709
I said I would, didn't I?

633
01:07:21,719 --> 01:07:23,670
That's not what I asked you.

634
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:26,048
Well, who wants to get married?

635
01:07:26,068 --> 01:07:30,161
You mean, even though you
don't wanna marry me...

636
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:32,337
you're willing to do it anyway?

637
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:34,247
Well...

638
01:07:34,837 --> 01:07:38,037
I'm just as much to blame as you are.

639
01:07:38,209 --> 01:07:41,611
More, it was my fault the whole thing and
I'm willing to take my medicine.

640
01:07:45,022 --> 01:07:46,911
That's really wonderful.

641
01:07:50,602 --> 01:07:52,340
And I'm the medicine, right?

642
01:07:54,050 --> 01:07:56,660
I know this may come as a great big shock
to the both of you...

643
01:07:56,679 --> 01:07:59,800
but underneath all this hair and skin
is a human girl.

644
01:07:59,804 --> 01:08:01,604
With all the regular things going for me.

645
01:08:01,731 --> 01:08:02,731
Believe it or not,

646
01:08:02,821 --> 01:08:06,174
I don't wanna spend the rest of my life married
to a man who's doing me a big favor.

647
01:08:07,284 --> 01:08:09,629
What did I say?
What are you talking about?

648
01:08:09,639 --> 01:08:11,862
All right, I made one mistake.

649
01:08:11,872 --> 01:08:12,872
And it was a beaut.

650
01:08:12,961 --> 01:08:15,911
But that doesn't mean I have to ruin
my whole life, and his, and the baby's.

651
01:08:15,929 --> 01:08:18,151
The man is willing to marry you.
What do you want?

652
01:08:22,471 --> 01:08:24,848
I don't want to be a warden all my life.

653
01:08:25,659 --> 01:08:27,271
The Prisoner of Zenda?

654
01:08:28,381 --> 01:08:29,381
Look...

655
01:08:29,645 --> 01:08:32,017
I appreciate what you're willing to do.

656
01:08:32,029 --> 01:08:33,129
I mean that.

657
01:08:33,286 --> 01:08:35,010
I really mean it.

658
01:08:35,029 --> 01:08:39,241
But as long as you feel like
being married is being in jail

659
01:08:39,261 --> 01:08:41,339
then you won't be happy, right?

660
01:08:43,849 --> 01:08:46,144
So if you're not happy,
then you take it out on me.

661
01:08:46,154 --> 01:08:47,478
And then I'm not happy.

662
01:08:47,489 --> 01:08:50,622
And if you're not happy, then I'm not happy,
and the baby's not happy.

663
01:08:52,933 --> 01:08:55,200
Who needs a house full of unhappy people?

664
01:08:55,209 --> 01:08:56,209
Where are you going?

665
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:58,200
I don't know. I gotta get out of here.
I'm gonna be late for work.

666
01:08:58,210 --> 01:09:00,592
You wanna here me say
I wanna get married?

667
01:09:00,602 --> 01:09:01,602
All right.

668
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:04,600
I wanna get married.

669
01:09:10,175 --> 01:09:12,161
I'm only trying to be honest with you.

670
01:09:14,771 --> 01:09:16,800
Tell the truth.

671
01:09:18,242 --> 01:09:20,300
If I said okay, your teeth would fall out.

672
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:25,700
Right or wrong?

673
01:09:39,007 --> 01:09:43,033
Dominic, I really owe you an apology,
you know.

674
01:09:43,053 --> 01:09:44,538
I really do.

675
01:09:44,548 --> 01:09:47,025
All this time I've been blaming you
for everything.

676
01:09:47,035 --> 01:09:49,515
You ruining my life and all that.

677
01:09:49,925 --> 01:09:51,768
Well, that's over now.

678
01:09:51,778 --> 01:09:54,420
You know why I've never been able
to leave home?

679
01:09:54,427 --> 01:09:56,144
I just suddenly figured it out.

680
01:09:56,155 --> 01:09:57,670
Very complicated.

681
01:09:57,677 --> 01:09:59,002
I was scared.

682
01:10:00,217 --> 01:10:01,781
And I'm not scared anymore.

683
01:10:03,191 --> 01:10:05,301
I'm terrified. Funny?

684
01:10:07,015 --> 01:10:08,775
Well, listen.

685
01:10:10,385 --> 01:10:13,301
Thank you Barbie for the use
of the Teddy bear.

686
01:10:26,214 --> 01:10:27,364
Coffee anyone?

687
01:10:29,313 --> 01:10:32,770
All my life sacrifying myself to have her
away like this.

688
01:10:32,776 --> 01:10:34,716
She'll come back...
Nonsense!

689
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:36,910
I understand how you feel Mrs Rossini.

690
01:10:37,049 --> 01:10:39,540
But in this country it isn't considered unusual

691
01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:41,611
for a girl to want an apartment of her own.

692
01:10:41,622 --> 01:10:44,332
There's a little more to it
than just wanting an apartment...

693
01:10:44,343 --> 01:10:46,777
Sure, tell him. Tell the whole world.
Why don't you put it in the paper.

694
01:10:46,787 --> 01:10:48,444
Mamma, we asked him to come here
to help.

695
01:10:48,456 --> 01:10:49,456
He's a priest, Ma.

696
01:10:49,570 --> 01:10:51,729
In the church he's a priest. In my house
he don't have to know everything.

697
01:10:51,739 --> 01:10:55,200
All right, mamma, you rest now.
Yes, yes, in my grave I'm gonna rest.

698
01:10:55,307 --> 01:10:58,607
It's like a stab in my heart.

699
01:10:58,795 --> 01:11:01,800
Take it easy, mamma.
Go away! Leave me alone!

700
01:11:02,776 --> 01:11:06,000
In my grave I'm gonna rest.
Hey, don't forget...

701
01:11:06,004 --> 01:11:07,540
What we're trying to do...

702
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:10,477
is there any way you can make a person
get married if they don't wanna?

703
01:11:11,488 --> 01:11:12,910
There must be a law or something.

704
01:11:14,018 --> 01:11:15,708
Look, there's no law.

705
01:11:15,743 --> 01:11:18,614
I told you before, you can't force a person
to get married.

706
01:11:18,625 --> 01:11:20,556
Look, I'll bury you.

707
01:11:21,136 --> 01:11:22,620
Get him out of here.

708
01:11:22,624 --> 01:11:24,000
Get him out of here.
Not in front of the priest.

709
01:11:24,202 --> 01:11:26,492
Get out of here.
Go out to the kitchen. Sit down.

710
01:11:26,505 --> 01:11:28,558
You can force somebody to pay upkeep,
or something like that

711
01:11:28,568 --> 01:11:30,358
but you can't force somebody to get married.

712
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:34,100
My son, often in this world you'll find

713
01:11:34,109 --> 01:11:37,470
that the law of man comes second
to the law of God.

714
01:11:37,819 --> 01:11:40,210
And the individual conscience of man...
Look, Father, I...

715
01:11:40,214 --> 01:11:44,468
Admit your guilt, my child,
and face the full responsibility.

716
01:11:45,178 --> 01:11:47,678
I'm willing to get married.
She won't.

717
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:51,378
But didn't you say...
She don't wanna.

718
01:11:51,386 --> 01:11:53,590
I'll tell you what she wants.
She wants bells and banjos.

719
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,910
Banjos?
What banjos?

720
01:11:54,917 --> 01:11:56,519
You want me to tell you something?

721
01:11:57,229 --> 01:11:59,880
What am I doing here?
I was willing to do my part.

722
01:11:59,886 --> 01:12:01,111
She didn't want me.

723
01:12:01,121 --> 01:12:02,121
Right?

724
01:12:02,176 --> 01:12:03,862
Good luck. From now on it's your problem.

725
01:12:03,872 --> 01:12:07,616
From now on it's your problem.
Hey, wait a minute.

726
01:12:07,626 --> 01:12:09,633
Listen, just for a minute.
No.

727
01:12:09,644 --> 01:12:11,584
Wait a minute, just a second.

728
01:12:11,594 --> 01:12:18,443
What a shame! What a shame.
What have I done to deserve this?

729
01:12:19,078 --> 01:12:20,808
Hey, Angie!

730
01:12:20,851 --> 01:12:22,801
Hi.
How are you?

731
01:12:22,816 --> 01:12:23,816
Fine.

732
01:12:25,395 --> 01:12:27,000
How are you?
Fine.

733
01:12:27,002 --> 01:12:28,002
That's fine.

734
01:12:28,445 --> 01:12:30,142
How're you doing in your little room
and everything?

735
01:12:30,162 --> 01:12:31,784
Who said it's a little room?

736
01:12:31,794 --> 01:12:33,900
It's two rooms and a half.

737
01:12:33,904 --> 01:12:36,921
Mom's in bed, you know.
We had a doctor and everything.

738
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,444
I think she lost the will to live.

739
01:12:38,464 --> 01:12:41,800
Dom, she'll live.
Listen, I gotta run. I'll see you, okay?

740
01:12:42,406 --> 01:12:43,406
Taxi!

741
01:12:44,256 --> 01:12:46,033
Maybe we could have some lunch
or something?
What?

742
01:12:46,044 --> 01:12:47,870
I said maybe we could have lunch
or something.

743
01:12:47,875 --> 01:12:49,883
I can't, Dom.
I got an appointment.

744
01:12:49,893 --> 01:12:50,893
Taxi.

745
01:12:51,145 --> 01:12:52,145
Who with?

746
01:12:52,556 --> 01:12:54,110
The beauty parlor.

747
01:12:54,117 --> 01:12:55,320
Okay, what for?

748
01:12:55,328 --> 01:12:56,328
Hey, taxi!

749
01:12:57,567 --> 01:12:59,027
What you got?
A date or something?

750
01:12:59,053 --> 01:13:00,353
Maybe.

751
01:13:00,498 --> 01:13:02,500
Who have you got a date with?

752
01:13:02,512 --> 01:13:03,512
Taxi.

753
01:13:03,534 --> 01:13:04,534
Do I know him?

754
01:13:04,971 --> 01:13:06,046
Where did you meet him?

755
01:13:06,456 --> 01:13:08,583
Can't you tell me who he is, at least?

756
01:13:08,594 --> 01:13:09,594
Rock Hudson.

757
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:11,386
On a horse.

758
01:13:17,593 --> 01:13:20,429
So I'm lucky I fell on my,
you know, wrist.

759
01:13:20,439 --> 01:13:23,639
I know this lady lives on the Avenue...
The cake is almost, you know.

760
01:13:23,817 --> 01:13:25,410
and she was walking down the,
you know, street

761
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:27,241
and she fell down and broke something

762
01:13:27,251 --> 01:13:28,851
in her back something

763
01:13:29,045 --> 01:13:31,450
and now she can't move both her,
you know, legs.

764
01:13:31,659 --> 01:13:35,119
Excuse me, I better see if the, you know...

765
01:13:35,129 --> 01:13:36,890
Anthony.
Oh...

766
01:13:40,193 --> 01:13:42,513
If I could see what I'm eating,
I could eat.

767
01:13:42,542 --> 01:13:44,246
Oh, mamma, leave it romantic.

768
01:13:46,056 --> 01:13:47,326
It's romantic enough.

769
01:13:58,536 --> 01:14:03,343
Excuse me, I'll go see if I can help.

770
01:14:07,053 --> 01:14:08,720
Hi.
Hi.

771
01:14:08,930 --> 01:14:11,567
Hot.
Careful, it's hot.

772
01:14:14,787 --> 01:14:16,225
I'll do it.

773
01:14:22,535 --> 01:14:25,890
Did you tell your mother?

774
01:14:25,901 --> 01:14:29,301
I haven't told her yet.
But I'm going to.

775
01:14:30,012 --> 01:14:31,781
I'm gonna tell her what uh...

776
01:14:31,991 --> 01:14:34,921
I'm gonna tell her about the uh...

777
01:14:35,763 --> 01:14:37,318
you know, the baby, and uh...

778
01:14:38,428 --> 01:14:40,770
Well... only... what I'm gonna tell her is...

779
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:43,662
I'm gonna tell her that I'm the...

780
01:14:43,872 --> 01:14:45,440
you know, the father.

781
01:15:00,647 --> 01:15:01,647
Get some butter.

782
01:15:01,677 --> 01:15:03,377
Cold water.

783
01:15:03,398 --> 01:15:05,329
Butter, will you get the butter?

784
01:15:05,339 --> 01:15:08,040
It's all right. It's fine.
You sure?

785
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:11,311
You hurt yourself.
No, no!

786
01:15:11,322 --> 01:15:13,882
No, it's nothing.
You sure?

787
01:15:13,892 --> 01:15:17,314
Yes.
Sit down. I'll help him.

788
01:15:17,324 --> 01:15:18,929
No, I'd like to, really.

789
01:15:18,939 --> 01:15:20,348
I love to help in the kitchen.

790
01:15:20,358 --> 01:15:23,242
What are you gonna help.
There's nothing to help.

791
01:15:23,262 --> 01:15:27,839
Both of you, sit.
All of you, you know, come on, sit down.

792
01:15:28,849 --> 01:15:32,569
Too many cooks spoil the, you know...

793
01:15:34,073 --> 01:15:35,073
the broth.

794
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:38,231
Better have a doctor check that hand.

795
01:15:59,241 --> 01:15:42,631
Oh, my goodness. Very sorry.

796
01:15:44,445 --> 01:15:47,550
Nine out of ten accidents happen in the home.

797
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:49,266
It's statistics.

798
01:16:07,499 --> 01:16:09,959
This is really a lovely room.

799
01:16:09,964 --> 01:16:11,841
You have wonderful taste.

800
01:16:11,861 --> 01:16:14,161
What you've done to this apartment.

801
01:16:18,285 --> 01:16:19,285
Okay!

802
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:21,239
I'm ready!

803
01:16:23,052 --> 01:16:24,052
Readier.

804
01:16:24,975 --> 01:16:27,500
I'm uh... you know.

805
01:16:27,518 --> 01:16:28,518
Anthony.

806
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:35,788
Oh, it's beautiful.
Just beautiful.

807
01:16:35,799 --> 01:16:37,474
What's the idea?

808
01:16:37,484 --> 01:16:40,073
Well, I thought that... you know,
like uh...

809
01:16:40,084 --> 01:16:42,262
like the 4th of July, huh?

810
01:16:42,273 --> 01:16:43,773
Big joke, huh?

811
01:16:45,741 --> 01:16:50,477
Mamma... when Anthony gets married
you will not be losing a son.

812
01:16:50,488 --> 01:16:52,760
Somebody will be gaining a cook.

813
01:16:52,767 --> 01:16:55,012
it's... er...

814
01:16:55,023 --> 01:16:57,950
College girl. Going to college.

815
01:16:57,957 --> 01:17:02,410
You'll have to excuse my mother.
She's anti-education at the present moment.

816
01:17:02,419 --> 01:17:05,465
Ever since I told her I was taking
a course in love.

817
01:17:05,985 --> 01:17:07,914
A course in love?

818
01:17:07,924 --> 01:17:10,990
Not really, it's just part of a course.

819
01:17:10,996 --> 01:17:13,376
I only say that to agitate them.

820
01:17:13,388 --> 01:17:16,213
The concept is that love

821
01:17:16,223 --> 01:17:19,458
taken on the mature level as opposed to the uh...

822
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:25,660
erotic, or the so-called romantic,
with all its false conceptions, is really an art.

823
01:17:25,667 --> 01:17:30,531
And like every other art,
it demands practice and patience

824
01:17:30,541 --> 01:17:33,110
consistent dedication and hard work.

825
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:37,134
I believe that.
I really do.

826
01:17:40,244 --> 01:17:42,044
Well, of course.

827
01:17:42,183 --> 01:17:45,444
Now, how can any intelligent person
in this age of reason

828
01:17:45,455 --> 01:17:49,110
make the most important selection of his life
merely on the basis of some kind of

829
01:17:49,116 --> 01:17:51,870
vague sexual attraction?

830
01:17:54,076 --> 01:17:55,220
Of course.

831
01:17:55,223 --> 01:17:59,809
I mean, if two people just start out being
nice to each other

832
01:17:59,818 --> 01:18:03,086
if they're just concerned about
what happens to each other

833
01:18:03,096 --> 01:18:04,096
that's all...

834
01:18:04,204 --> 01:18:06,535
and they're just nice...

835
01:18:06,545 --> 01:18:08,623
then I think it happens.

836
01:18:08,634 --> 01:18:09,790
Don't you?

837
01:18:09,795 --> 01:18:12,878
What do you mean?
Love.

838
01:18:16,788 --> 01:18:19,021
I mean, what they call being in love.

839
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:21,900
I think that love, actually,

840
01:18:21,905 --> 01:18:22,905
as such...

841
01:18:23,634 --> 01:18:26,283
is strictly a middle-class idea.

842
01:18:26,293 --> 01:18:29,020
And it is definitely on its way out.

843
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,076
Yes, I think so too.

844
01:18:31,086 --> 01:18:32,110
Actually.

845
01:18:33,118 --> 01:18:35,343
I mean, I don't think that love
is something that you...

846
01:18:35,353 --> 01:18:37,618
fall into. Like a hole in the ground.

847
01:18:42,729 --> 01:18:45,752
Now, if a person is even halfway mature

848
01:18:45,762 --> 01:18:50,470
when you consider the
enormous responsibilities involved in marriage,

849
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:52,625
you can't take it lightly.

850
01:18:52,635 --> 01:18:55,640
You can't.
Knowing that the future generation

851
01:18:55,645 --> 01:19:00,046
is entirely due to the wisdom
of your procreation.

852
01:19:00,076 --> 01:19:02,676
Of course.

853
01:19:02,799 --> 01:19:04,901
You want the...
Sorry.

854
01:19:04,911 --> 01:19:07,101
I just don't know what is the matter with me.

855
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:10,367
I'll get a towel...  you know, wipe it.
Don't worry about the dress, I'm just...

856
01:19:10,397 --> 01:19:12,889
worried about the dinner table.
That's all right.

857
01:19:12,899 --> 01:19:15,545
We're only lucky it wasn't, you know,
hot coffee.

858
01:19:15,865 --> 01:19:18,466
Oh, it's terrible. I'm so sorry.

859
01:19:24,177 --> 01:19:26,180
She's not a bad-looking girl.

860
01:19:26,986 --> 01:19:29,170
But she's so clumsy.

861
01:20:18,879 --> 01:20:19,979
Hi.

862
01:20:22,221 --> 01:20:23,890
Oh, hi.

863
01:20:25,102 --> 01:20:26,702
How're you doing?

864
01:20:26,995 --> 01:20:28,305
Fine.

865
01:20:31,038 --> 01:20:32,738
I was in the neighborhood,

866
01:20:32,801 --> 01:20:35,083
so I thought I'd drop up see how you were making out.

867
01:20:37,023 --> 01:20:38,593
Oh...

868
01:20:50,395 --> 01:20:51,522
So, how's everything?

869
01:20:51,533 --> 01:20:52,533
Fine.

870
01:20:54,667 --> 01:20:56,187
No, I mean the problem.

871
01:20:56,797 --> 01:20:57,807
Fine.

872
01:20:57,992 --> 01:20:59,950
What do you mean fine?

873
01:21:00,266 --> 01:21:02,535
Would you excuse me just a minute, please?

874
01:21:07,146 --> 01:21:09,810
Listen, what time do you get off?
Let's have a cup of coffee or something.

875
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:12,315
Will you excuse me a minute?

876
01:21:12,325 --> 01:21:14,400
Well, what do you say?
Shall I pick you up after?

877
01:21:14,412 --> 01:21:16,321
Oh, I can't tonight.

878
01:21:16,331 --> 01:21:18,450
Uh, all right, well uh...

879
01:21:18,458 --> 01:21:21,275
Tomorrow then, okay?
I'll pick you up after or what?

880
01:21:21,285 --> 01:21:23,400
No, I can't tomorrow night either.

881
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:27,670
Oh. What do you mean you can't?
It's a cup of coffee.

882
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:29,983
I've got a date.

883
01:21:33,393 --> 01:21:34,463
With who?

884
01:21:37,489 --> 01:21:38,839
What's funny?

885
01:21:38,845 --> 01:21:42,233
If I didn't know better, I'd swear
you're my brother Dominic.

886
01:21:43,144 --> 01:21:46,121
Look. I just wanted to see you
that's all.

887
01:21:46,131 --> 01:21:48,127
See how you feel and see how you're making out.

888
01:21:48,137 --> 01:21:51,820
So, fine, I saw you.
And everything's fine, so...

889
01:21:51,830 --> 01:21:52,830
fine.

890
01:21:56,906 --> 01:21:57,906
Oh.

891
01:22:00,119 --> 01:22:01,519
Listen...

892
01:22:01,644 --> 01:22:03,192
Do you want to make it Monday?

893
01:22:03,202 --> 01:22:06,410
Monday, what am I supposed to do?
Wait around until Monday?

894
01:22:06,415 --> 01:22:08,113
Hey, Angie, when you get a minute.

895
01:22:10,223 --> 01:22:14,036
All right, I'll meet you Monday.
I'll see you Monday.

896
01:22:23,356 --> 01:22:24,574
Come here a minute.

897
01:22:26,104 --> 01:22:29,427
Look, why don't you come
to my place Sunday?

898
01:22:29,437 --> 01:22:31,078
I'll make dinner.

899
01:22:33,698 --> 01:22:35,175
I'll take you out to dinner.

900
01:22:37,005 --> 01:22:38,945
Don't you want to see my new apartment?

901
01:22:39,269 --> 01:22:40,809
You want me to?

902
01:22:40,850 --> 01:22:43,013
If you want to.

903
01:22:43,033 --> 01:22:45,111
Okay, you got a deal.

904
01:22:45,121 --> 01:22:46,121
Sunday.

905
01:22:49,694 --> 01:22:51,291
Oh, wait a minute.

906
01:22:51,301 --> 01:22:53,824
You don't know where I live.
Oh, East 11th street.

907
01:24:25,034 --> 01:24:26,400
Just a minute.

908
01:24:37,010 --> 01:24:38,800
Hi. Come on in.

909
01:24:44,604 --> 01:24:45,604
Hi.

910
01:24:46,221 --> 01:24:48,450
Man, do you look wild.

911
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:51,866
Thank you.
No, I mean it,

912
01:24:52,011 --> 01:24:53,011
I really mean it.

913
01:24:53,082 --> 01:24:55,900
Look how surprised he sounds.
You look so...

914
01:24:55,904 --> 01:24:57,646
What am I gonna tell you?

915
01:24:57,656 --> 01:24:59,516
You look like a woman.

916
01:25:02,243 --> 01:25:05,443
How can you manage to make even
a compliment sound like a slap in the face?

917
01:25:05,453 --> 01:25:07,167
What did I say?
You look like a woman.

918
01:25:07,187 --> 01:25:09,418
I apologize, excuse me.
You look like man.

919
01:25:10,428 --> 01:25:11,808
Do you wanna fight all day?

920
01:25:11,818 --> 01:25:13,959
Who's fighting? I don't wanna fight.

921
01:25:15,069 --> 01:25:16,511
All right, then. Sit down.

922
01:25:16,521 --> 01:25:17,860
I'll make you a drink.

923
01:25:24,570 --> 01:25:26,210
I don't know what it is.

924
01:25:26,215 --> 01:25:29,549
First time in my life I come to see a girl
and I feel like I'm 14 years old.

925
01:25:29,559 --> 01:25:31,577
Even whe I was 14 I didn't feel
like that.

926
01:25:35,088 --> 01:25:36,688
They're beautiful.

927
01:25:36,715 --> 01:25:37,715
Thank you.

928
01:25:43,251 --> 01:25:45,454
What  would you like to drink?

929
01:25:45,464 --> 01:25:48,756
Scotch, I don't know.
What do you got?

930
01:25:50,124 --> 01:25:53,041
Scotch, gin, bourbon, vodka...

931
01:25:54,561 --> 01:25:56,474
What are you, on the sauce now?

932
01:25:57,087 --> 01:25:58,671
I thought you didn't drink.

933
01:25:58,681 --> 01:26:02,745
I don't.
What are you running here? The USO?

934
01:26:04,265 --> 01:26:05,701
Would you like a drink?

935
01:26:05,714 --> 01:26:06,714
Thank you.

936
01:26:08,238 --> 01:26:10,238
Scotch?
Thank you.

937
01:26:13,338 --> 01:26:15,501
Water, soda or tonic?

938
01:26:17,218 --> 01:26:18,701
Scotch and tonic?

939
01:26:18,711 --> 01:26:19,711
Uh, very good.

940
01:26:21,549 --> 01:26:22,849
Zelda,

941
01:26:23,073 --> 01:26:25,539
Gin and tonic, yes.
Vodka and tonic, yes.

942
01:26:25,549 --> 01:26:27,428
Scotch and tonic, no.

943
01:26:31,138 --> 01:26:32,238
Water.

944
01:26:34,048 --> 01:26:36,348
Thank you.
You gotta know these things
if you're gonna run

945
01:26:36,482 --> 01:26:38,031
a respectable den of inequity.

946
01:26:40,002 --> 01:26:42,900
I'll learn in my own little way.

947
01:26:52,302 --> 01:26:54,222
You know something,
I'll tell you the truth.

948
01:26:54,233 --> 01:26:56,635
You're kind of okay, I mean that.

949
01:26:57,645 --> 01:26:59,340
Look, will you do me a favor?

950
01:26:59,350 --> 01:27:01,452
Don't pay me any more compliments.

951
01:27:03,062 --> 01:27:05,900
All I'm trying to tell you is
I think you're pretty great, that's all.

952
01:27:05,905 --> 01:27:07,549
You didn't ask anybody for anything,

953
01:27:07,559 --> 01:27:09,713
you didn't sit around feeling sorry for yourself.

954
01:27:12,525 --> 01:27:14,067
I think you're something.

955
01:27:15,577 --> 01:27:16,577
I mean that.

956
01:27:18,513 --> 01:27:20,177
And I just wanted to tell you.

957
01:27:24,797 --> 01:27:25,797
Thank you.

958
01:27:53,901 --> 01:27:55,051
Is it all right?

959
01:27:55,067 --> 01:27:56,553
The way you like it?

960
01:27:58,163 --> 01:27:59,600
Delicious.

961
01:28:00,802 --> 01:28:02,000
Really?

962
01:28:02,006 --> 01:28:03,706
No, I mean it. It's delicious.

963
01:28:09,291 --> 01:28:12,111
It is kind of a test run for me.

964
01:28:12,122 --> 01:28:15,014
The man I'm going out with is
in the restaurant business.

965
01:28:15,834 --> 01:28:18,334
And so before I cook for him...

966
01:28:18,602 --> 01:28:20,332
Anything I can do to help, lady.

967
01:28:27,043 --> 01:28:28,375
Would you like some?

968
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,122
So tell me...

969
01:28:58,142 --> 01:28:59,422
How have you been?

970
01:29:01,003 --> 01:29:02,078
Who me?

971
01:29:02,098 --> 01:29:04,463
Great, just great.

972
01:29:06,173 --> 01:29:07,440
That's wonderful.

973
01:29:10,550 --> 01:29:14,080
Yeah, I'm filling in for a friend of mine
every once in a while over in Radio City.

974
01:29:14,090 --> 01:29:17,551
He's quitting the business,
Going to open up a used car lot
in New Jersey.

975
01:29:17,571 --> 01:29:20,138
Said I could have a job there
if I wanted to.

976
01:29:21,358 --> 01:29:22,458
Permanently.

977
01:29:24,756 --> 01:29:27,435
Really.
That's wonderful.

978
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:28,445
Wonderful?

979
01:29:28,796 --> 01:29:32,666
Five days a week, rain or shine,
in sickness or health, who needs it?

980
01:29:32,866 --> 01:29:34,300
I go where the wind blows me.

981
01:29:34,310 --> 01:29:36,579
If I don't wanna go to work,
I don't have to go to work.

982
01:29:36,589 --> 01:29:39,111
And I can stay in bed all day long
if I want to.

983
01:29:43,323 --> 01:29:45,246
So wonderful. You're happy.

984
01:29:47,556 --> 01:29:49,056
Well, I am.

985
01:29:50,265 --> 01:29:51,805
I really am.

986
01:30:02,654 --> 01:30:04,422
Nice place you got here.

987
01:30:05,432 --> 01:30:06,641
It really is.

988
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:08,744
You can see you put a lot
of yourself in it.

989
01:30:09,854 --> 01:30:11,412
Little things here and there.

990
01:30:14,425 --> 01:30:15,525
Very nice.

991
01:30:23,505 --> 01:30:24,911
You made it very nice.

992
01:30:30,031 --> 01:30:31,300
You know something?

993
01:30:31,303 --> 01:30:33,773
If you didn't try so hard
to play against it

994
01:30:33,783 --> 01:30:36,000
you could be e pretty decent
kind of a person.

995
01:30:36,143 --> 01:30:38,036
Look how surprised she sounds.

996
01:30:44,556 --> 01:30:46,014
What do you think you're doing?

997
01:30:46,034 --> 01:30:48,522
As if I didn't know.
Come here, Louis.

998
01:30:48,533 --> 01:30:49,533
Louis?

999
01:30:49,589 --> 01:30:51,103
A new kind of experiment.

1000
01:31:15,813 --> 01:31:16,703
Don't.

1001
01:31:21,282 --> 01:31:23,672
You better understand something
here and now.

1002
01:31:24,698 --> 01:31:27,001
What we did before,
that was something happened

1003
01:31:27,014 --> 01:31:29,700
don't ask me how or why,
but it's not gonna happen again.

1004
01:31:29,717 --> 01:31:30,717
Why not?

1005
01:31:33,116 --> 01:31:34,801
Don't you understand?

1006
01:31:34,818 --> 01:31:37,301
I didn't know you then.
I didn't care about you.

1007
01:31:37,312 --> 01:31:39,765
I know you now.
I like you.

1008
01:31:42,475 --> 01:31:44,932
Man, I end up with a...

1009
01:31:46,552 --> 01:31:48,618
Look. Why don't you sit down?

1010
01:31:48,638 --> 01:31:50,627
I invited you to dinner.
Let's have dinner.

1011
01:32:02,237 --> 01:32:03,537
Tell me something.

1012
01:32:03,549 --> 01:32:04,549
That cook...

1013
01:32:06,553 --> 01:32:08,218
that friend of yours
in the restaurant business

1014
01:32:08,238 --> 01:32:10,201
Do you like him too,
the way you like me now?

1015
01:32:10,220 --> 01:32:13,071
Or do you not care about him the way
you used to not care about me?

1016
01:32:22,192 --> 01:32:24,032
What are you, some kind of a nut?

1017
01:32:24,062 --> 01:32:26,233
Thank you so much for dropping in.

1018
01:32:26,253 --> 01:32:28,034
I'm sorry you had to leave so early.

1019
01:32:28,054 --> 01:32:31,357
Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean... I made a bad joke.

1020
01:32:31,367 --> 01:32:33,267
Dead, dead. You're dead.

1021
01:32:33,279 --> 01:32:37,351
Wait a minute.
Look! I've got a man who wants
to get married.

1022
01:32:37,371 --> 01:32:39,028
And he wants to get married to me.

1023
01:32:39,048 --> 01:32:42,154
And if I don't hear the bells and the banjos
ringing everytime I look at him...

1024
01:32:42,174 --> 01:32:44,153
I can just live without the bells
and the banjos.

1025
01:32:44,163 --> 01:32:46,047
Cause I don't hear them when I look
at you either.

1026
01:32:46,067 --> 01:32:48,031
Listen, Angie.
Will you get away from me, please.

1027
01:32:48,061 --> 01:32:49,280
Just get away from me.

1028
01:32:49,290 --> 01:32:51,662
And stay away from me.
I don't want to see you anymore, ever.

1029
01:32:51,672 --> 01:32:54,453
Go, go where the wind blows you.

1030
01:32:55,663 --> 01:32:57,763
Hey, Angie!

1031
01:32:57,817 --> 01:33:00,437
And if you think you're such a big prize
talking to every girl in the world

1032
01:33:00,494 --> 01:33:02,243
who's out to to trap you.

1033
01:33:02,363 --> 01:33:05,135
Now wait a minute, will you?

1034
01:33:11,745 --> 01:33:14,144
Hey, come on, Angie.
Let me in, will you?

1035
01:33:22,255 --> 01:33:23,255
Angie.

1036
