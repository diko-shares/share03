00:01:05.262 --> 00:01:06.923
<i>I don't have time.</i>

2
00:01:08.065 --> 00:01:10.898
<i>I don't have time to
worry about how it happened.</i>

3
00:01:11.435 --> 00:01:13.198
<i>It is what it is.</i>

4
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:17.905
<i>We're genetically engineered
to stop aging at 25.</i>

5
00:01:18.742 --> 00:01:21.973
<i>The trouble is, we live only one more year</i>

6
00:01:22.746 --> 00:01:24.907
<i>unless we can get more time.</i>

7
00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:30.743
<i>Time is now the currency.</i>

8
00:01:31.822 --> 00:01:34.416
<i>We earn it and spend it.</i>

9
00:01:35.426 --> 00:01:37.758
<i>The rich can live forever.</i>

10
00:01:38.596 --> 00:01:39.995
<i>And the rest of us?</i>

11
00:01:41.498 --> 00:01:43.728
<i>I just want to wake up
with more time on my hand</i>

12
00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:45.496
<i>than hours in the day.</i>

13
00:02:17.034 --> 00:02:18.092
Hey, Mom.

14
00:02:18.902 --> 00:02:20.062
You got in late last night.

15
00:02:20.137 --> 00:02:21.729
I put in some overtime.

16
00:02:21.905 --> 00:02:23.031
Where'd it go?

17
00:02:23.574 --> 00:02:24.563
On you.

18
00:02:24.908 --> 00:02:27.604
They drink it in New Greenwich.
Happy 50th!

19
00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:29.768
Fifty?

20
00:02:30.247 --> 00:02:31.578
That's right.

21
00:02:32.316 --> 00:02:34.477
Twenty-five for the 25th time.

22
00:02:34.752 --> 00:02:37.482
Oh, I was sure I'd have a grandchild by now.

23
00:02:37.755 --> 00:02:38.744
Here we go.

24
00:02:38.822 --> 00:02:40.517
Bela's daughter is always asking about you.

25
00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:44.254
Who has time for a girlfriend?
Besides, what's the hurry?

26
00:02:44.828 --> 00:02:46.159
What do you got?

27
00:02:46.764 --> 00:02:48.823
Three days. Not even.

28
00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:50.497
We owe half that in rent.

29
00:02:50.567 --> 00:02:53.661
Eight for the electric and
we're still late on that loan.

30
00:02:53.771 --> 00:02:56.501
I can make extra on the side, you know.

31
00:02:57.441 --> 00:02:59.602
- I could...
- What, start fighting?

32
00:03:01.278 --> 00:03:02.267
Nobody wins.

33
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:03.969
Yeah.

34
00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:06.477
Remember, I'm not here tonight.

35
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.040
I got two days' work in the garment district.

36
00:03:08.285 --> 00:03:09.684
- I know.
- Meet me at the bus stop tomorrow.

37
00:03:09.787 --> 00:03:11.846
- After I pay off the loan, I won't have long.
- I'll be there.

38
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.452
Will...

39
00:03:15.192 --> 00:03:18.184
I just wouldn't know what to do if I lost you.

40
00:03:18.295 --> 00:03:19.455
I'm late.

41
00:03:19.697 --> 00:03:22.291
Let me give you 30 minutes
so you can have a decent lunch.

42
00:03:37.214 --> 00:03:38.306
I love you.

43
00:03:39.717 --> 00:03:41.309
Happy birthday, Mom.

44
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.448
When you get back,
we're going to celebrate.

45
00:03:54.832 --> 00:03:55.992
Will!

46
00:03:56.333 --> 00:03:57.322
Will!

47
00:03:58.335 --> 00:03:59.324
You got a minute?

48
00:03:59.503 --> 00:04:01.368
What are you talking about, Mya?
You have a whole year.

49
00:04:02.206 --> 00:04:03.571
Not a year I can use yet.

50
00:04:04.174 --> 00:04:06.404
Come on, Will. I've got bills to pay.

51
00:04:09.513 --> 00:04:11.708
Here, take five minutes.

52
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.580
Get out of here.

53
00:04:32.369 --> 00:04:34.428
Four minutes for a cup of coffee?

54
00:04:34.505 --> 00:04:35.938
Yesterday, it was three.

55
00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:37.939
You want coffee or you want to reminisce?

56
00:04:38.208 --> 00:04:39.539
Two coffees.

57
00:04:42.613 --> 00:04:44.604
- How many shifts you got today, Borel?
- Just the two.

58
00:04:45.549 --> 00:04:47.380
Really excited about it.

59
00:04:49.386 --> 00:04:52.617
If you had any of your father in you,
we could make a fortune.

60
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.723
I don't fight.

61
00:04:59.396 --> 00:05:01.796
There's another one. Broad daylight.

62
00:05:35.098 --> 00:05:37.726
Whoa, what is this? Where's the rest?

63
00:05:37.935 --> 00:05:38.959
Never met the quota.

64
00:05:39.036 --> 00:05:40.503
My units are up from last week.

65
00:05:40.671 --> 00:05:42.434
So's the quota. Next.

66
00:05:42.506 --> 00:05:43.632
That's a joke, right?

67
00:05:44.007 --> 00:05:46.134
- Next.
- Move it. You're taking forever.

68
00:06:04.528 --> 00:06:05.790
You in, Will?

69
00:06:05.863 --> 00:06:07.626
I don't have time to gamble anymore.

70
00:06:07.865 --> 00:06:09.355
Oh, thank God.

71
00:06:09.466 --> 00:06:12.458
Because ever since you stopped playing,
I started winning.

72
00:06:12.536 --> 00:06:13.696
You still owe me an hour.

73
00:06:16.473 --> 00:06:17.804
You seen Borel?

74
00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:27.480
- Will!
- Hey, man.

75
00:06:28.218 --> 00:06:29.207
Your wife's looking for you.

76
00:06:29.286 --> 00:06:30.310
You're not gonna believe it.

77
00:06:30.387 --> 00:06:34.187
This madman's been buying drinks all night.
He's got a century!

78
00:06:35.893 --> 00:06:37.554
Come on, let me get you home.

79
00:06:37.895 --> 00:06:39.829
Soon as I finish this drink.

80
00:06:40.497 --> 00:06:42.158
Hey! You!

81
00:06:42.633 --> 00:06:43.622
You!

82
00:06:44.735 --> 00:06:46.066
More everything!

83
00:06:49.006 --> 00:06:51.065
Do you want to come home with me?

84
00:06:51.174 --> 00:06:53.506
You can take us both home.

85
00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:03.247
Excuse me.

86
00:07:04.254 --> 00:07:06.017
You need to get out of here.

87
00:07:06.356 --> 00:07:07.846
Somebody's gonna clean that clock.

88
00:07:08.025 --> 00:07:09.083
Yes!

89
00:07:11.862 --> 00:07:14.831
I mean, they aren't going to rob you.
They are going to kill you.

90
00:07:15.766 --> 00:07:16.755
They can't take that much time

91
00:07:16.833 --> 00:07:18.266
and let you live to tell about it.

92
00:07:18.368 --> 00:07:19.357
Yes.

93
00:07:19.603 --> 00:07:22.766
I don't think you understand.
You should not be here!

94
00:07:30.013 --> 00:07:31.605
Will. Will!

95
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.381
Minutemen!

96
00:07:34.618 --> 00:07:36.176
Minutemen! Walk away, Will.

97
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.918
Those gangsters aren't playing around.

98
00:07:41.925 --> 00:07:43.256
Wait, wait.

99
00:07:43.727 --> 00:07:47.060
He's asking for it. Let's go.
He's not one of us.

100
00:07:47.798 --> 00:07:49.129
You think he'd help us?

101
00:07:50.133 --> 00:07:52.624
Don't worry. I won't do anything stupid.

102
00:07:53.236 --> 00:07:54.225
Go.

103
00:07:59.876 --> 00:08:01.434
The name's Fortis.

104
00:08:03.914 --> 00:08:07.406
And that, sir, is a very nice watch.

105
00:08:11.088 --> 00:08:14.580
Do you mind if I try it on?
I think it would suit me.

106
00:08:17.094 --> 00:08:18.493
I'll tell you what.

107
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:21.591
I'll fight you for it.

108
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.158
Come on.

109
00:08:25.502 --> 00:08:28.596
I'm an old man. Turned 75 last week.

110
00:08:38.015 --> 00:08:39.175
I need a moment.

111
00:08:55.298 --> 00:08:56.697
You ready to go?

112
00:08:58.869 --> 00:09:00.029
Ready to go.

113
00:09:03.974 --> 00:09:05.305
Let's get you out of here.

114
00:09:08.478 --> 00:09:09.809
Get him!

115
00:09:10.647 --> 00:09:13.980
Stop. What are you doing?
I can take care of myself.

116
00:09:14.051 --> 00:09:15.643
Yeah, it looked like it.

117
00:09:17.821 --> 00:09:18.947
I know what I'm doing.

118
00:09:19.022 --> 00:09:20.216
Run. Run!

119
00:09:33.336 --> 00:09:34.564
Come on!

120
00:09:35.672 --> 00:09:37.071
Here!

121
00:09:39.843 --> 00:09:40.901
Hurry!

122
00:09:46.016 --> 00:09:47.244
Move!

123
00:09:57.527 --> 00:09:59.859
Where the hell are you going? Get in here!

124
00:10:42.539 --> 00:10:44.370
I know who took him.

125
00:10:44.808 --> 00:10:46.639
I know who he is.

126
00:10:49.246 --> 00:10:50.736
Who he was.

127
00:10:58.288 --> 00:11:00.483
Damn it, damn it.

128
00:11:03.994 --> 00:11:06.155
What the hell are you doing here?

129
00:11:06.429 --> 00:11:08.090
Flashing all that?

130
00:11:08.298 --> 00:11:09.390
You out of your mind?

131
00:11:10.934 --> 00:11:11.992
Henry Hamilton.

132
00:11:15.438 --> 00:11:16.427
Will Salas.

133
00:11:25.182 --> 00:11:26.774
Ugh.

134
00:11:27.083 --> 00:11:28.072
God.

135
00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:30.012
Drink more, it gets better.

136
00:11:37.194 --> 00:11:38.422
Not much better.

137
00:11:44.301 --> 00:11:45.791
You'll be safe till morning.

138
00:11:46.136 --> 00:11:47.797
I'll get you out of here.

139
00:11:49.306 --> 00:11:50.705
You're from New Greenwich.

140
00:11:52.209 --> 00:11:53.642
Does it show?

141
00:11:54.644 --> 00:11:55.804
Nah.

142
00:12:02.652 --> 00:12:04.813
Looks like you could use some help yourself.

143
00:12:05.055 --> 00:12:06.386
No, thanks.

144
00:12:06.656 --> 00:12:08.214
How old are you?

145
00:12:09.059 --> 00:12:10.219
In real time?

146
00:12:10.994 --> 00:12:12.325
Twenty-eight.

147
00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:14.387
I'm 105.

148
00:12:14.664 --> 00:12:15.995
Good for you.

149
00:12:17.334 --> 00:12:20.497
You won't see 106, you have too many
more nights like tonight.

150
00:12:21.338 --> 00:12:22.669
You are right.

151
00:12:24.674 --> 00:12:26.665
But the day comes when you've had enough.

152
00:12:28.345 --> 00:12:31.337
Your mind can be spent,
even if your body's not.

153
00:12:34.184 --> 00:12:35.845
We want to die.

154
00:12:37.087 --> 00:12:38.315
We need to.

155
00:12:42.192 --> 00:12:46.026
That's your problem?
You've been alive too long?

156
00:12:49.432 --> 00:12:50.922
You ever known anyone who's died?

157
00:12:57.774 --> 00:13:00.436
For a few to be immortal, many must die.

158
00:13:06.049 --> 00:13:07.949
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

159
00:13:10.287 --> 00:13:12.278
You really don't know, do you?

160
00:13:14.724 --> 00:13:17.454
Everyone can't live forever.
Where would we put them?

161
00:13:20.897 --> 00:13:23.058
Why do you think there are Time Zones?

162
00:13:24.467 --> 00:13:26.594
Why do you think taxes and prices go up

163
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.297
the same day in the ghetto?

164
00:13:30.307 --> 00:13:33.242
The cost of living keeps rising to
make sure people keep dying.

165
00:13:35.078 --> 00:13:36.807
How else could there be
men with a million years

166
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.313
while most live day to day?

167
00:13:42.752 --> 00:13:44.481
But the truth is

168
00:13:45.822 --> 00:13:47.153
there's more than enough.

169
00:13:49.926 --> 00:13:52.588
No one has to die before their time.

170
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:04.504
If you had as much time
as I have on that clock,

171
00:14:06.976 --> 00:14:08.568
what would you do with it?

172
00:14:12.449 --> 00:14:14.110
I'd stop watching it.

173
00:14:18.355 --> 00:14:20.118
I can tell you one thing.

174
00:14:20.623 --> 00:14:22.614
If I had all that time,

175
00:14:23.293 --> 00:14:25.693
I sure as hell wouldn't waste it.

176
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:35.369
Get some rest.

177
00:14:39.376 --> 00:14:41.367
Don't worry. I won't take it in the night.

178
00:14:41.978 --> 00:14:43.878
And I won't take yours.

179
00:14:58.294 --> 00:14:59.352
It does get better.

180
00:17:03.219 --> 00:17:04.982
- Oh, hey, Will.
- Hey, Greta.

181
00:17:05.889 --> 00:17:07.049
Is Borel in?

182
00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.884
Yeah. Borel?

183
00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:11.620
Look at that.

184
00:17:11.961 --> 00:17:14.486
A shame we gotta wait 25 years.

185
00:17:14.564 --> 00:17:15.895
We could use that year right now.

186
00:17:17.066 --> 00:17:18.055
Borel?

187
00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.232
I'm here.

188
00:17:24.908 --> 00:17:26.637
You'd better get her inside, Greta.

189
00:17:35.251 --> 00:17:36.582
Look at this.

190
00:17:39.155 --> 00:17:40.486
Where did you get that?

191
00:17:41.758 --> 00:17:43.316
The guy at the bar.

192
00:17:43.927 --> 00:17:45.656
They were going to kill him.

193
00:17:46.429 --> 00:17:48.090
He gave it to me.

194
00:17:49.666 --> 00:17:51.657
He timed himself out
before I could stop him.

195
00:17:51.768 --> 00:17:54.168
No one gives anybody 100 years.

196
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:56.802
He didn't just give me this.

197
00:17:56.873 --> 00:17:58.033
He gave me the truth about it.

198
00:17:58.107 --> 00:17:59.802
You can't let anyone see that.

199
00:18:00.443 --> 00:18:01.432
Hey.

200
00:18:01.611 --> 00:18:03.738
You know that time will get you killed.

201
00:18:09.953 --> 00:18:11.181
How long have we been friends?

202
00:18:12.422 --> 00:18:14.083
What, 10 years?

203
00:18:14.657 --> 00:18:15.749
Here.

204
00:18:22.265 --> 00:18:23.596
A decade.

205
00:18:26.269 --> 00:18:27.566
You've been like a brother.

206
00:18:29.872 --> 00:18:31.032
Where are you going?

207
00:18:32.008 --> 00:18:33.999
Where this won't look out of place.

208
00:18:35.612 --> 00:18:38.137
I finally got the time to take my mom
to New Greenwich.

209
00:18:56.532 --> 00:18:58.295
Greta, I'm going out!

210
00:18:59.135 --> 00:19:01.763
<i>Loan payment received,
two days. Thank you.</i>

211
00:19:10.546 --> 00:19:11.535
Dayton.

212
00:19:12.048 --> 00:19:13.106
Two hours.

213
00:19:16.853 --> 00:19:18.047
It's always been an hour.

214
00:19:18.721 --> 00:19:20.484
Now it's two. Price went up.

215
00:19:20.556 --> 00:19:21.545
Since when?

216
00:19:22.058 --> 00:19:23.218
Since today.

217
00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.551
My son is meeting me.
He'll pay the difference.

218
00:19:26.663 --> 00:19:28.528
I can't do that, policy.

219
00:19:30.333 --> 00:19:31.527
Please?

220
00:19:32.902 --> 00:19:34.733
It's a two-hour walk.

221
00:19:38.341 --> 00:19:40.070
I have an hour and a half.

222
00:19:43.179 --> 00:19:44.510
Then you'd better run.

223
00:20:17.547 --> 00:20:20.710
Stop! Please stop!

224
00:20:52.749 --> 00:20:56.241
Wait! Please! Please, no!

225
00:20:57.253 --> 00:20:59.312
Wait! No! Please!

226
00:21:20.943 --> 00:21:22.103
Mom?

227
00:21:22.178 --> 00:21:23.167
Will!

228
00:21:27.784 --> 00:21:29.115
Will!

229
00:21:29.852 --> 00:21:31.786
- Will!
- Mom!

230
00:21:44.867 --> 00:21:46.858
No, no, no, no!

231
00:21:59.549 --> 00:22:00.641
No!

232
00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:03.143
Mom, Mom, Mom!

233
00:22:29.312 --> 00:22:30.438
Thirteen zeros.

234
00:22:31.013 --> 00:22:32.503
Unlucky for all.

235
00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:35.647
The last time anyone saw him alive,

236
00:22:35.718 --> 00:22:37.913
there was over a century on that clock.

237
00:22:38.921 --> 00:22:40.912
Around here, they'd kill you for a week.

238
00:22:41.023 --> 00:22:42.820
What was he doing in this Time Zone?

239
00:22:45.027 --> 00:22:46.187
What I was thinking

240
00:22:47.597 --> 00:22:49.929
was he might have brought this on himself.

241
00:22:50.032 --> 00:22:52.592
Interesting. How long
you been keeping time, Jaeger?

242
00:22:52.869 --> 00:22:53.961
Five years.

243
00:22:54.737 --> 00:22:56.898
Let me know what you think
when you have been doing it for 50.

244
00:22:58.007 --> 00:22:59.474
It doesn't matter why he came here.

245
00:22:59.542 --> 00:23:03.000
What matters are the hundred years
that came with him.

246
00:23:05.748 --> 00:23:07.409
Gotta be a witness.

247
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:09.513
Trust me, no one saw anything.

248
00:23:09.585 --> 00:23:10.882
What would you like us to do, sir?

249
00:23:12.421 --> 00:23:15.254
What we always do. Follow the time.

250
00:23:19.028 --> 00:23:22.191
Hey, Ray. I'll give you 10 minutes
for an hour.

251
00:23:22.265 --> 00:23:23.926
When are you gonna
get out of the game, Leila?

252
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.194
You gotta be pushing 60.

253
00:23:25.368 --> 00:23:27.199
Thanks for letting everyone know.

254
00:23:38.648 --> 00:23:39.672
<i>Am I in the right place?</i>

255
00:24:03.572 --> 00:24:06.735
We don't normally make
pickups in this Zone.

256
00:24:08.077 --> 00:24:09.738
I was lost.

257
00:24:15.985 --> 00:24:17.646
<i>Please deposit
one month.</i>

258
00:24:42.611 --> 00:24:45.273
<i>Please deposit two months.</i>

259
00:24:53.622 --> 00:24:55.613
There are more of these than I remember.

260
00:25:07.436 --> 00:25:08.926
That was a year.

261
00:25:09.472 --> 00:25:11.303
Welcome to New Greenwich.

262
00:25:13.976 --> 00:25:15.807
What are you really doing here?

263
00:25:17.813 --> 00:25:20.304
I'm going to take them
for everything they've got.

264
00:25:24.887 --> 00:25:26.650
I'm going to make them pay.

265
00:26:29.718 --> 00:26:31.879
Please, miss. You can't be too careful.

266
00:26:31.954 --> 00:26:33.649
Are you sure?

267
00:26:36.725 --> 00:26:37.987
What's a night here cost?

268
00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:40.028
Two months for a standard room.

269
00:26:43.799 --> 00:26:44.891
Give me a suite.

270
00:26:56.412 --> 00:26:57.470
Do you need help with your bags?

271
00:26:58.481 --> 00:26:59.641
No.

272
00:27:11.093 --> 00:27:13.584
- He's fast.
- He's going to have to be.

273
00:27:14.263 --> 00:27:17.096
The camera doesn't show us
how the body got into the river.

274
00:27:17.166 --> 00:27:18.929
What do we really know?

275
00:27:19.034 --> 00:27:21.093
What do we know?

276
00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:24.606
We know that most thefts in Dayton
amount to hours or days.

277
00:27:25.174 --> 00:27:26.937
This was a century.

278
00:27:28.277 --> 00:27:30.336
I don't see any more in circulation.

279
00:27:31.313 --> 00:27:32.644
He could have capsuled the time.

280
00:27:32.948 --> 00:27:35.348
You can't hide a hundred years
in the ghetto.

281
00:27:35.618 --> 00:27:38.610
They can sense when a man has
a month more than he should.

282
00:27:41.357 --> 00:27:42.949
The time left town.

283
00:28:28.337 --> 00:28:30.567
That'll be eight and a half weeks.

284
00:28:32.841 --> 00:28:34.331
Take a week for yourself.

285
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:36.170
Thanks.

286
00:28:41.417 --> 00:28:45.080
You're not from around here, are you?

287
00:28:46.922 --> 00:28:49.186
You do everything a little too fast.

288
00:28:50.359 --> 00:28:51.383
Not everything.

289
00:28:53.362 --> 00:28:54.693
What's that place across the street?

290
00:28:55.764 --> 00:28:56.924
The casino.

291
00:28:57.199 --> 00:28:58.860
Can anybody go?

292
00:29:00.436 --> 00:29:01.528
Not dressed like that.

293
00:29:02.871 --> 00:29:04.202
Good luck.

294
00:29:10.879 --> 00:29:12.938
Sir, you were right.

295
00:29:13.048 --> 00:29:15.573
If you turn back the clocks
the day of Hamilton's death,

296
00:29:15.651 --> 00:29:16.777
and look at the time checks,

297
00:29:16.852 --> 00:29:19.821
someone spent years crossing
four different Time Zones from Dayton...

298
00:29:19.888 --> 00:29:24.222
To New Greenwich. The cameras picked up
on his suspicious behavior.

299
00:29:24.293 --> 00:29:26.454
He's conscious of the surveillance,

300
00:29:26.528 --> 00:29:29.292
he doesn't have a bodyguard, and he runs.

301
00:29:29.565 --> 00:29:31.897
But if he has time, he doesn't need to run.

302
00:29:32.134 --> 00:29:34.068
It's a hard habit to break.

303
00:29:35.804 --> 00:29:37.465
You're looking for a match?

304
00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.233
His name is Will Salas.

305
00:29:40.809 --> 00:29:42.140
You know him?

306
00:29:43.078 --> 00:29:44.238
No.

307
00:29:45.748 --> 00:29:47.147
I remember his father.

308
00:29:54.923 --> 00:29:56.254
Good evening.

309
00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:00.325
I assume my time is as good as anyone's.

310
00:30:00.429 --> 00:30:04.991
Indeed it is. However,
there is a voluntary donation

311
00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.762
for non-members. Most give a year.

312
00:30:15.611 --> 00:30:16.942
What's your game?

313
00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:18.303
Poker.

314
00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:19.608
Right this way.

315
00:30:22.017 --> 00:30:23.507
What's the limit?

316
00:30:24.286 --> 00:30:25.617
There is none.

317
00:30:39.702 --> 00:30:42.535
I don't believe we've had the pleasure
of your company before, Mr...

318
00:30:42.604 --> 00:30:44.037
Salas.

319
00:30:44.206 --> 00:30:45.298
Will Salas.

320
00:30:45.974 --> 00:30:49.705
Philippe Weis. You must come from time.

321
00:30:52.881 --> 00:30:54.940
You could say I'm gambling my inheritance.

322
00:30:55.017 --> 00:30:57.508
You don't have a guard, Mr. Salas?

323
00:31:00.723 --> 00:31:02.884
I assumed I was amongst friends.

324
00:31:09.898 --> 00:31:11.058
Bet you 50 years.

325
00:31:19.508 --> 00:31:20.998
You must be young.

326
00:31:21.844 --> 00:31:24.904
When you've been 25 for 85 years,
like I have,

327
00:31:25.013 --> 00:31:28.244
knowing only a random act of violence
can take your life,

328
00:31:28.751 --> 00:31:30.582
you learn to appreciate what you have.

329
00:31:31.687 --> 00:31:33.518
And you seem to have a lot to appreciate.

330
00:31:37.025 --> 00:31:38.253
I call.

331
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:58.874
Of course,
some think what we have is unfair.

332
00:31:59.615 --> 00:32:01.207
The time difference between Zones.

333
00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:02.881
I've heard that.

334
00:32:04.052 --> 00:32:06.543
But isn't this just the next logical step
in our evolution?

335
00:32:06.688 --> 00:32:09.555
And hasn't evolution always been unfair?

336
00:32:09.625 --> 00:32:11.252
It's always been survival of the fittest.

337
00:32:13.629 --> 00:32:15.893
Raise you another two centuries.

338
00:32:18.801 --> 00:32:21.793
This is merely Darwinian capitalism.

339
00:32:23.639 --> 00:32:24.799
Natural selection.

340
00:32:25.574 --> 00:32:26.905
Absolutely.

341
00:32:27.643 --> 00:32:29.304
The strong survive.

342
00:32:30.412 --> 00:32:32.403
And I think your hand is weak.

343
00:32:33.749 --> 00:32:35.080
I call.

344
00:32:50.332 --> 00:32:52.664
It appears you're all in, Mr. Salas.

345
00:33:23.365 --> 00:33:24.923
Thirteen figures.

346
00:33:26.368 --> 00:33:27.699
Well played.

347
00:33:29.304 --> 00:33:31.135
That was some risk.

348
00:33:35.677 --> 00:33:37.008
It wasn't a risk.

349
00:33:37.312 --> 00:33:40.645
No offense. I knew I was going to win.

350
00:33:42.818 --> 00:33:44.217
Confusing times.

351
00:33:45.988 --> 00:33:48.320
Is she my mother, my sister
or my daughter?

352
00:33:48.457 --> 00:33:50.357
You're hoping she's not my wife.

353
00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:54.993
Things used to be simpler once. So I'm told.

354
00:33:56.832 --> 00:33:57.992
Very beautiful.

355
00:33:59.735 --> 00:34:00.724
Daughter.

356
00:34:01.169 --> 00:34:04.832
Though she does look
a lot like my wife. Sylvia?

357
00:34:05.741 --> 00:34:07.140
Will Salas.

358
00:34:07.209 --> 00:34:08.676
Congratulations, Mr. Salas.

359
00:34:10.412 --> 00:34:12.403
You've taken years off my father's life.

360
00:34:12.514 --> 00:34:15.915
Which is normally what you do.
Isn't that right, my darling?

361
00:34:17.519 --> 00:34:19.510
We're having a party tomorrow night.

362
00:34:20.088 --> 00:34:23.421
Perhaps you'll give him a chance to
win back some of those years.

363
00:34:24.726 --> 00:34:25.852
I'd love to.

364
00:34:25.928 --> 00:34:27.623
Carl will tell you where I am.

365
00:34:27.696 --> 00:34:29.027
Good night, Mr. Salas.

366
00:34:29.531 --> 00:34:31.692
Sylvia, stay with your guards.

367
00:34:46.381 --> 00:34:48.212
Fifty-nine years.

368
00:34:48.450 --> 00:34:49.576
Plus tax.

369
00:35:01.463 --> 00:35:02.623
The price includes delivery.

370
00:35:03.565 --> 00:35:04.623
Delivery?

371
00:35:05.233 --> 00:35:07.224
To wherever you're going to display it.

372
00:35:08.904 --> 00:35:10.064
Display it?

373
00:35:10.305 --> 00:35:12.136
Hell, I'm going to drive it.

374
00:35:32.127 --> 00:35:33.116
Will Salas.

375
00:35:35.097 --> 00:35:37.429
Allow me to introduce
my mother-in-law, Clara,

376
00:35:38.166 --> 00:35:41.431
my wife, Michele, and my daughter, Sylvia.

377
00:35:41.603 --> 00:35:43.332
I believe you two have already met.

378
00:35:45.607 --> 00:35:47.097
Nice to meet you all.

379
00:35:47.242 --> 00:35:48.732
I'll come find you later

380
00:35:49.311 --> 00:35:50.505
for our game.

381
00:35:51.179 --> 00:35:52.771
I look forward to it.

382
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:10.021
Having fun, Mr. Salas?

383
00:36:12.634 --> 00:36:13.965
Please, call me Will.

384
00:36:15.137 --> 00:36:16.968
It's okay, Constantin.

385
00:36:19.808 --> 00:36:22.800
Do you always have a hired hand
standing right next to you?

386
00:36:22.878 --> 00:36:24.368
No. I usually have two.

387
00:36:26.982 --> 00:36:29.041
That doesn't make it very easy
to get to know you.

388
00:36:29.217 --> 00:36:30.878
I think that's the idea.

389
00:36:31.153 --> 00:36:32.643
Your idea?

390
00:36:32.721 --> 00:36:33.779
My father's.

391
00:36:33.855 --> 00:36:34.981
I understand.

392
00:36:35.991 --> 00:36:37.982
You all have a lot to lose.

393
00:36:38.827 --> 00:36:40.317
So do you.

394
00:36:43.331 --> 00:36:44.992
What do you do, Will?

395
00:36:45.667 --> 00:36:47.658
I haven't quite figured that out yet.

396
00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:52.162
Yes, why bother? What's the hurry?

397
00:36:53.241 --> 00:36:56.574
Right. Why do today what
you can do in a century?

398
00:36:57.579 --> 00:36:58.910
I know one thing we can do.

399
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:03.577
Dance with me.

400
00:37:10.125 --> 00:37:12.184
Do you really come from time?

401
00:37:13.295 --> 00:37:14.956
Why would you doubt that?

402
00:37:17.532 --> 00:37:19.124
I saw you run.

403
00:37:20.135 --> 00:37:22.626
Reminds me of people
who come from the ghetto.

404
00:37:25.807 --> 00:37:27.798
Sometimes I envy them.

405
00:37:30.979 --> 00:37:32.640
You don't know anything.

406
00:37:33.982 --> 00:37:37.474
Oh, no? The clock is good for no one.

407
00:37:40.155 --> 00:37:42.487
The poor die and the rich don't live.

408
00:37:42.891 --> 00:37:46.224
We can all live forever as long as
we don't do anything foolish.

409
00:37:46.995 --> 00:37:51.659
Doesn't that scare you? That maybe
you'll never do anything foolish?

410
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.663
Or courageous or anything worth a damn?

411
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:02.670
Come with me.

412
00:38:17.759 --> 00:38:19.420
This was tonight.

413
00:38:22.097 --> 00:38:24.190
He's only an hour ahead of us.

414
00:38:31.373 --> 00:38:32.863
Look at that.

415
00:38:34.042 --> 00:38:35.873
I've never seen anything like it.

416
00:38:39.347 --> 00:38:40.678
What are you doing?

417
00:38:42.551 --> 00:38:43.779
We don't go in.

418
00:38:46.555 --> 00:38:48.113
You're insane.

419
00:38:48.557 --> 00:38:51.720
You have this in your backyard.
You never go in.

420
00:38:53.228 --> 00:38:54.559
And I'm insane?

421
00:38:59.568 --> 00:39:02.560
Well? What are you waiting for?

422
00:39:04.306 --> 00:39:05.967
Sylvia, come on!

423
00:39:06.741 --> 00:39:09.232
What happened to doing something foolish?

424
00:39:30.999 --> 00:39:32.830
I don't know you.

425
00:39:34.769 --> 00:39:36.327
We could change that.

426
00:39:39.274 --> 00:39:40.605
I get it.

427
00:39:41.743 --> 00:39:44.576
You're out here, all alone,

428
00:39:45.113 --> 00:39:46.774
with a stranger.

429
00:39:48.216 --> 00:39:49.877
You can't be too careful.

430
00:39:51.186 --> 00:39:52.278
Maybe you can.

431
00:39:53.788 --> 00:39:54.948
Sylvia!

432
00:39:57.292 --> 00:39:58.452
Sylvia!

433
00:40:08.637 --> 00:40:10.468
I have to go back.

434
00:40:11.539 --> 00:40:12.870
To what?

435
00:40:19.047 --> 00:40:20.708
You should go back.

436
00:40:32.661 --> 00:40:35.061
- Have you seen my daughter?
- I have.

437
00:40:36.531 --> 00:40:37.520
She's with her guards.

438
00:40:39.501 --> 00:40:40.832
Right behind you.

439
00:40:43.672 --> 00:40:45.003
Thank God.

440
00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:46.900
Now,

441
00:40:47.409 --> 00:40:48.501
how about that game?

442
00:40:57.585 --> 00:41:00.247
It's all right, everyone. What's this about?

443
00:41:02.691 --> 00:41:04.750
I'm sorry to have to
break up the party, Mr. Weis.

444
00:41:06.194 --> 00:41:07.593
I just need a word with your friend.

445
00:41:10.031 --> 00:41:11.362
My friend?

446
00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:13.931
Very well.

447
00:41:41.296 --> 00:41:43.230
I'm Timekeeper Raymond Leon.

448
00:41:47.335 --> 00:41:48.324
I'm Will Salas.

449
00:41:48.403 --> 00:41:49.734
I know.

450
00:41:53.308 --> 00:41:54.639
What are you doing in this Zone?

451
00:41:55.744 --> 00:41:58.235
It's not illegal, is it? To change Time Zones?

452
00:41:58.913 --> 00:42:00.744
No, it's not illegal.

453
00:42:01.916 --> 00:42:04.077
It's just rare.

454
00:42:09.157 --> 00:42:10.249
Where did you get that?

455
00:42:10.492 --> 00:42:11.652
I won it.

456
00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:13.991
Gambling.

457
00:42:17.432 --> 00:42:18.592
All of it?

458
00:42:24.105 --> 00:42:25.163
No.

459
00:42:26.274 --> 00:42:28.765
A man named Henry Hamilton
gave me over a century.

460
00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:34.114
He said he didn't need it anymore.

461
00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:37.442
He timed himself out.

462
00:42:38.186 --> 00:42:41.121
Henry Hamilton was
worth thousands of years.

463
00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:43.849
He could practically live forever.

464
00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:50.420
You expect me to believe that
he was immortal and he wanted to die?

465
00:42:51.132 --> 00:42:53.123
I don't expect you to believe it.

466
00:42:54.536 --> 00:42:55.696
But it's the truth.

467
00:42:57.839 --> 00:42:59.170
It was a gift.

468
00:42:59.974 --> 00:43:01.202
I'm not a thief.

469
00:43:03.311 --> 00:43:06.303
But, hey, if you guys
are looking for stolen time,

470
00:43:07.882 --> 00:43:09.474
maybe you should arrest everyone here.

471
00:43:09.717 --> 00:43:10.809
Oh, I see.

472
00:43:11.886 --> 00:43:13.319
You're talking about justice.

473
00:43:15.056 --> 00:43:17.217
Well, I am a Timekeeper.

474
00:43:17.659 --> 00:43:20.321
I don't concern myself with "justice."

475
00:43:20.829 --> 00:43:23.992
I only concern myself
with what I can measure.

476
00:43:24.499 --> 00:43:26.990
Seconds, minutes, hours.

477
00:43:29.504 --> 00:43:30.562
I keep time.

478
00:43:32.407 --> 00:43:34.898
And that time is in the wrong hands.

479
00:43:37.512 --> 00:43:40.845
That time will be held, along with you.

480
00:43:44.252 --> 00:43:46.743
We'll leave you two hours
for booking and processing.

481
00:43:50.425 --> 00:43:52.359
Why are you investigating a suicide?

482
00:43:54.863 --> 00:43:56.660
There's mass murder
in the ghetto every day.

483
00:44:03.771 --> 00:44:05.261
That is fascinating.

484
00:44:06.674 --> 00:44:07.663
Huh.

485
00:44:09.377 --> 00:44:11.607
I heard another man talk like that.

486
00:44:13.047 --> 00:44:15.038
It was over 20 years ago.

487
00:44:17.952 --> 00:44:20.614
You're probably too young
to remember your father.

488
00:44:22.223 --> 00:44:24.214
We'll arrange safe transport.

489
00:44:25.059 --> 00:44:27.118
This is New Greenwich, after all.

490
00:44:31.966 --> 00:44:34.594
Sylvia? Do as I say and go with the guards.

491
00:44:34.736 --> 00:44:37.398
Oh, for God's sake, Father.
There's an army in this house.

492
00:44:37.739 --> 00:44:41.800
If we can't stop one man from killing us,
we should kill ourselves.

493
00:45:03.898 --> 00:45:05.229
Stop him!

494
00:45:08.002 --> 00:45:10.766
Move! Get out of the way!

495
00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:17.669
Put it down or I'll blow her head off.

496
00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:20.442
Thanks.

497
00:45:59.654 --> 00:46:02.214
You're going to kill us!
Please just let me out!

498
00:46:27.982 --> 00:46:29.040
What are you doing?

499
00:46:31.486 --> 00:46:32.976
Do you even know how to drive?

500
00:46:33.755 --> 00:46:35.245
What's there to know?

501
00:46:49.604 --> 00:46:50.866
Oh, shit.

502
00:47:27.475 --> 00:47:28.908
Give me some time.

503
00:47:31.479 --> 00:47:33.413
I guess you really are
from the ghetto, after all.

504
00:47:33.981 --> 00:47:37.075
What the hell do you know about
where I'm from? Give me some time.

505
00:47:37.485 --> 00:47:39.817
Or you're gonna kill me,
like you killed Henry Hamilton?

506
00:47:40.288 --> 00:47:41.619
Lend me an hour.

507
00:47:42.156 --> 00:47:43.214
I'm not giving you a second.

508
00:47:45.827 --> 00:47:47.294
I should have listened to my father.

509
00:47:49.764 --> 00:47:52.255
Please, take me home. Please.

510
00:47:52.834 --> 00:47:54.267
- I can't do that.
- Why?

511
00:47:54.602 --> 00:47:55.933
You're keeping me alive.

512
00:47:58.172 --> 00:47:59.503
Keep that covered.

513
00:48:00.141 --> 00:48:02.473
Anybody sees it, you're definitely dead.

514
00:48:36.778 --> 00:48:38.609
Now that worked too well.

515
00:48:38.679 --> 00:48:40.943
You guys wasted a gorgeous car.

516
00:48:41.282 --> 00:48:42.772
Look who it is.

517
00:48:43.017 --> 00:48:44.450
Who it was.

518
00:48:47.688 --> 00:48:49.019
He's done in minutes.

519
00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:52.350
He'll wake up dead. That'll be a shock.

520
00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:56.193
Too bad. I would have preferred to
kill him more beautifully.

521
00:48:56.464 --> 00:48:58.022
The girl's still breathing.

522
00:48:58.800 --> 00:48:59.789
She's got a decade.

523
00:49:01.135 --> 00:49:02.466
Holy shit.

524
00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:05.332
The man he stole from me
had more than a century.

525
00:49:10.311 --> 00:49:12.541
What? We'll divide it later.

526
00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:14.811
It's like an angel fell from the sky.

527
00:49:19.821 --> 00:49:20.981
Fortis!

528
00:49:21.055 --> 00:49:22.249
Leave it!

529
00:49:22.557 --> 00:49:23.649
Fortis!

530
00:49:50.351 --> 00:49:51.682
Look at me.

531
00:49:51.919 --> 00:49:53.250
You okay?

532
00:49:53.688 --> 00:49:54.848
No.

533
00:49:57.358 --> 00:49:58.416
Why are you laughing?

534
00:49:59.927 --> 00:50:00.951
We're not dead.

535
00:50:01.062 --> 00:50:02.552
Yeah, we're not alive for long, either.

536
00:50:03.264 --> 00:50:05.926
Where did my time go? I have a half hour!

537
00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:07.458
Ah.

538
00:50:07.535 --> 00:50:08.934
You're lucky.

539
00:50:09.704 --> 00:50:12.104
- Minutemen.
- Does everyone in the ghetto steal?

540
00:50:12.206 --> 00:50:13.434
That's rich, coming from you.

541
00:50:14.609 --> 00:50:16.304
- Please help me, Will.
- Let me guess,

542
00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:18.605
now you like the idea of sharing.

543
00:50:20.781 --> 00:50:21.941
Come here.

544
00:50:24.619 --> 00:50:27.213
Hey, don't worry.
It's not the first time I've been this broke.

545
00:50:27.455 --> 00:50:29.218
Well, it's a first for me.

546
00:50:30.625 --> 00:50:32.286
What are we going to do?

547
00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:35.552
Whatever we have to.
Come on, we got to go.

548
00:50:55.583 --> 00:50:57.949
Dispatch, wire me my per diem.

549
00:50:58.286 --> 00:51:00.117
<i>Time transfer.</i>

550
00:51:04.659 --> 00:51:06.593
Cutting it close again, sir.

551
00:51:06.928 --> 00:51:09.089
Well, I'm still walking around.

552
00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:11.263
Judging by the lack of dead bodies,

553
00:51:11.332 --> 00:51:13.766
I have to assume they are also.

554
00:51:18.439 --> 00:51:22.102
They got jacked. They couldn't have
left here with more than minutes.

555
00:51:22.343 --> 00:51:24.436
He's back in his old neighborhood.

556
00:51:25.846 --> 00:51:28.007
So, where do you want us to start looking?

557
00:51:29.617 --> 00:51:32.848
We don't. He'll come to us.

558
00:51:53.474 --> 00:51:54.736
Borel?

559
00:51:57.812 --> 00:51:59.803
Borel, open up. It's Will.

560
00:52:01.983 --> 00:52:03.143
Greta.

561
00:52:04.986 --> 00:52:06.180
Where's Borel?

562
00:52:07.154 --> 00:52:08.815
He's dead.

563
00:52:09.824 --> 00:52:12.156
Dead? What?

564
00:52:12.393 --> 00:52:13.587
You gave him a decade.

565
00:52:15.062 --> 00:52:17.690
He drank himself to death
with nine years on his clock.

566
00:52:17.765 --> 00:52:19.096
Jesus Christ.

567
00:52:22.103 --> 00:52:23.570
Greta, I'm so sorry.

568
00:52:24.772 --> 00:52:26.262
Goodbye, Will.

569
00:52:34.382 --> 00:52:35.406
Will, we have minutes.

570
00:52:35.483 --> 00:52:36.541
Try not to act like it.

571
00:52:36.617 --> 00:52:38.482
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Shut up!

572
00:52:38.586 --> 00:52:40.213
We're going to die, Will!
Do you want to die?

573
00:52:40.287 --> 00:52:41.618
Shut up!

574
00:52:47.461 --> 00:52:49.895
I hope those are real. Run.

575
00:53:01.742 --> 00:53:02.800
Stop! Wait!

576
00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:04.002
Please, wait!

577
00:53:06.147 --> 00:53:07.637
Come back in an hour.

578
00:53:07.748 --> 00:53:09.238
That won't be possible.

579
00:53:11.852 --> 00:53:13.012
Here!

580
00:53:27.835 --> 00:53:28.961
I'll give you two days for them.

581
00:53:29.437 --> 00:53:30.529
They're diamonds.

582
00:53:30.771 --> 00:53:33.001
You can take the 48 hours,
or you can be a pretty corpse.

583
00:53:33.607 --> 00:53:34.767
We'll take it.

584
00:53:45.786 --> 00:53:47.151
Don't make a sound.

585
00:53:47.221 --> 00:53:48.552
Give me my time.

586
00:53:55.396 --> 00:53:56.385
Let's go.

587
00:53:58.165 --> 00:53:59.996
I guess I got my wish.

588
00:54:00.067 --> 00:54:02.194
I did do something foolish.

589
00:54:05.005 --> 00:54:06.836
Your name's on a lot of buildings.

590
00:54:06.907 --> 00:54:08.499
It's my father's name.

591
00:54:08.676 --> 00:54:10.735
How much is he worth, anyway?

592
00:54:12.012 --> 00:54:13.343
Eons.

593
00:54:13.748 --> 00:54:15.682
What do you think he'd pay to get you back?

594
00:54:15.916 --> 00:54:18.180
You have no shame, do you?

595
00:54:22.189 --> 00:54:24.521
<i>Please deposit one minute.</i>

596
00:54:26.694 --> 00:54:27.752
Dial.

597
00:54:42.209 --> 00:54:43.198
Hello.

598
00:54:43.277 --> 00:54:46.212
Mr. Weis, please give the phone
to the Timekeeper.

599
00:54:52.052 --> 00:54:55.044
Hello, Will. How much do you want?

600
00:54:55.890 --> 00:54:56.948
A thousand years.

601
00:54:58.125 --> 00:54:59.456
You'll never live to spend it.

602
00:55:04.565 --> 00:55:06.726
Then distribute it
to the Time Lines in Dayton.

603
00:55:08.235 --> 00:55:10.567
Do it by sunrise tomorrow
and she can go home.

604
00:55:13.374 --> 00:55:14.534
Will...

605
00:55:16.076 --> 00:55:17.907
I'm afraid for you, Will.

606
00:55:18.245 --> 00:55:21.442
You keep talking like him,
you're going to die like him.

607
00:55:21.649 --> 00:55:25.141
My father died in a fight,
trying to take a man's time.

608
00:55:25.252 --> 00:55:28.415
Oh, no. His crime wasn't taking time.

609
00:55:29.657 --> 00:55:31.921
<i>He was doing something
far more dangerous.</i>

610
00:55:33.828 --> 00:55:35.659
Please don't make your father's mistake.

611
00:55:42.102 --> 00:55:43.831
Dayton. Pedre Plaza.

612
00:55:44.171 --> 00:55:45.502
I know it.

613
00:55:46.774 --> 00:55:49.607
A thousand years to the Time Lines.

614
00:55:49.844 --> 00:55:51.277
A thousand years.

615
00:55:53.848 --> 00:55:55.338
It's nothing.

616
00:55:55.616 --> 00:55:57.447
It's for our daughter.

617
00:55:59.186 --> 00:56:01.017
No, it's for them.

618
00:56:01.556 --> 00:56:03.046
This is insane.

619
00:56:03.124 --> 00:56:05.319
They can take your time, just like that.

620
00:56:06.494 --> 00:56:08.155
Or you can take theirs.

621
00:56:08.496 --> 00:56:09.986
This is insane.

622
00:56:10.665 --> 00:56:12.997
Yeah, it's insane.

623
00:56:27.014 --> 00:56:29.005
We should be safe here until dawn.

624
00:56:30.418 --> 00:56:33.182
I pay by the day.
It'll take them a while to find me.

625
00:56:38.759 --> 00:56:40.056
This is your place?

626
00:56:43.864 --> 00:56:46.594
There's water. It's cold, but it's something.

627
00:56:47.868 --> 00:56:50.029
You can put on fresh clothes.

628
00:57:21.235 --> 00:57:22.429
Where's your family?

629
00:57:24.472 --> 00:57:26.235
My mother timed out.

630
00:57:29.410 --> 00:57:30.468
This is her dress.

631
00:57:30.745 --> 00:57:31.905
Yeah.

632
00:57:35.483 --> 00:57:36.916
What about your father?

633
00:57:38.452 --> 00:57:39.783
He died when I was a boy.

634
00:57:40.921 --> 00:57:43.253
He was a fighter. Strong arm.

635
00:57:45.326 --> 00:57:49.092
He wasn't the strongest,
but he knew how to win.

636
00:57:50.765 --> 00:57:52.096
How do you win?

637
00:58:00.274 --> 00:58:01.605
I'll show you.

638
00:58:06.447 --> 00:58:09.780
What you do is let them
have the upper hand.

639
00:58:10.117 --> 00:58:13.609
Then, he'd let his time go all the way down.

640
00:58:15.022 --> 00:58:16.455
Because he knew

641
00:58:17.124 --> 00:58:19.183
that when you were
down to your last seconds

642
00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:21.791
and they think it's over,

643
00:58:23.297 --> 00:58:25.629
they start watching your clock

644
00:58:29.370 --> 00:58:30.701
and forget to watch their own.

645
00:58:47.054 --> 00:58:48.715
He died in a fight?

646
00:58:51.992 --> 00:58:56.224
I think he was killed
for giving away what he won.

647
00:58:56.330 --> 00:58:58.491
He wasn't just giving them time.

648
00:58:59.333 --> 00:59:00.698
He was giving them hope.

649
00:59:06.006 --> 00:59:07.473
How long have you been this old?

650
00:59:08.175 --> 00:59:09.540
Twenty-five for three.

651
00:59:11.679 --> 00:59:13.340
Twenty-five for two.

652
00:59:16.050 --> 00:59:18.041
What was it like when your clock started?

653
00:59:21.856 --> 00:59:23.289
<i>I was in the street.</i>

654
00:59:23.357 --> 00:59:25.348
<i>It almost knocked me over.</i>

655
00:59:26.026 --> 00:59:28.586
<i>My year was gone in a week,
we were so in debt.</i>

656
00:59:29.029 --> 00:59:31.862
After that, I lived day to day.

657
00:59:33.768 --> 00:59:35.702
Mine was a little different.

658
00:59:37.538 --> 00:59:38.869
It woke me.

659
00:59:51.552 --> 00:59:53.213
<i>I looked in the mirror.</i>

660
00:59:54.722 --> 00:59:56.713
<i>I guess everybody does.</i>

661
00:59:58.793 --> 01:00:01.284
<i>That's what you're gonna look like
for the rest of your life.</i>

662
01:00:02.897 --> 01:00:04.956
My dad gave me a decade to celebrate.

663
01:00:07.234 --> 01:00:08.462
You must hate me.

664
01:00:10.571 --> 01:00:12.061
Where I come from.

665
01:00:12.907 --> 01:00:15.398
It's nobody's fault, what they're born with.

666
01:00:36.831 --> 01:00:38.492
They open in a minute.

667
01:00:40.167 --> 01:00:42.328
Let's see how generous your father is now.

668
01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.861
The Timekeepers would
have never let him do it.

669
01:01:15.135 --> 01:01:16.693
You don't have to say that.

670
01:01:17.805 --> 01:01:20.638
How do you think my father
built all those buildings?

671
01:01:21.141 --> 01:01:23.473
By giving away a thousand years?

672
01:01:27.815 --> 01:01:29.146
Now what?

673
01:01:30.985 --> 01:01:32.384
You can go home.

674
01:01:34.488 --> 01:01:36.183
There's people on the streets.

675
01:01:36.257 --> 01:01:37.485
I can move without being spotted.

676
01:01:38.559 --> 01:01:39.651
What have you got?

677
01:01:42.563 --> 01:01:43.894
Eleven hours.

678
01:01:45.966 --> 01:01:47.831
How does anyone live like this?

679
01:01:47.902 --> 01:01:49.494
You don't generally sleep in.

680
01:01:57.578 --> 01:01:59.170
You can call for help.

681
01:01:59.847 --> 01:02:01.314
I'll watch from here,
I'll make sure you're safe.

682
01:02:01.382 --> 01:02:03.111
You know, you could fight this.

683
01:02:04.218 --> 01:02:06.083
I can say that running to
the ghetto was my idea.

684
01:02:07.421 --> 01:02:09.048
My father'd believe that,
he thinks I'm reckless.

685
01:02:10.724 --> 01:02:12.191
He has a lot of influence, Will.

686
01:02:12.259 --> 01:02:13.749
He can get you a lawyer.

687
01:02:13.861 --> 01:02:15.658
He can make a deal with those Timekeepers.

688
01:02:16.263 --> 01:02:18.231
I'm pretty sure
that Timekeeper doesn't make deals.

689
01:02:22.236 --> 01:02:24.067
What are you going to do?

690
01:02:24.238 --> 01:02:25.569
Steal?

691
01:02:27.741 --> 01:02:29.834
Is it stealing if it's already stolen?

692
01:02:32.846 --> 01:02:35.178
Here. Just in case.

693
01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:37.808
I'll be right here.

694
01:03:08.716 --> 01:03:11.048
<i>Please deposit
one minute.</i>

695
01:03:16.223 --> 01:03:17.884
<i>- Father?
- Sylvia?</i>

696
01:03:18.125 --> 01:03:20.286
You couldn't spare a second, Father?

697
01:03:20.961 --> 01:03:22.292
I wish I could say I'm surprised.

698
01:03:28.235 --> 01:03:29.259
Did you hear what I just said?

699
01:03:29.336 --> 01:03:30.564
<i>You know I'd do anything for you.</i>

700
01:03:32.139 --> 01:03:33.231
They're coming to get you.

701
01:03:33.474 --> 01:03:35.135
<i>They know where you are.</i>

702
01:03:35.409 --> 01:03:36.535
Will, look out!

703
01:03:55.262 --> 01:03:57.389
Sorry to disappoint you,
we don't keep much on us.

704
01:03:58.599 --> 01:04:01.090
To discourage thieves like you.

705
01:04:06.507 --> 01:04:07.667
Think of this as a gift.

706
01:04:09.777 --> 01:04:10.937
Will! Come on!

707
01:04:33.367 --> 01:04:35.358
I didn't mean to shoot him.
I wanted to scare him.

708
01:04:35.469 --> 01:04:37.096
I think you did both.

709
01:04:37.805 --> 01:04:39.295
You could say thank you.

710
01:04:39.373 --> 01:04:41.705
Thank you. What have you got?

711
01:04:42.976 --> 01:04:44.375
Nine hours.

712
01:04:45.145 --> 01:04:48.137
Why did you give him time?
You should have taken it.

713
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:52.482
Timekeepers live day to day.

714
01:04:54.054 --> 01:04:56.716
It'll be hours before the others show up.

715
01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:59.117
He could die in the ghetto.

716
01:04:59.193 --> 01:05:00.490
He still might.

717
01:05:00.994 --> 01:05:02.985
Timekeeper, what's the hurry?

718
01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:07.223
Stay a while.
You might like us if you got to know us!

719
01:05:11.071 --> 01:05:12.595
They're going to think you're with me.

720
01:05:12.673 --> 01:05:14.072
Yes.

721
01:05:16.243 --> 01:05:18.006
This is a mess.

722
01:05:18.412 --> 01:05:19.845
Welcome to my world.

723
01:05:23.851 --> 01:05:25.182
Back off!

724
01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:29.750
You've been shot.
I was worried you timed out.

725
01:05:31.258 --> 01:05:32.589
Where'd you get that?

726
01:05:45.239 --> 01:05:46.831
What are we going to do?

727
01:05:46.907 --> 01:05:48.966
We can't keep driving around in this car.

728
01:05:49.042 --> 01:05:50.236
It's a cop car.

729
01:05:51.778 --> 01:05:53.006
So let's make an arrest.

730
01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:14.799
Was I going too fast?

731
01:06:15.802 --> 01:06:17.565
Not fast enough.

732
01:06:17.971 --> 01:06:20.098
The mistake you made was stopping.

733
01:06:21.575 --> 01:06:24.567
Now, let's see who you got back there.

734
01:06:27.414 --> 01:06:29.712
Got to be a year or two nobody's using.

735
01:06:31.185 --> 01:06:32.174
Whoa!

736
01:06:34.488 --> 01:06:35.921
It went off.

737
01:06:36.256 --> 01:06:37.655
I was just trying to help.

738
01:06:44.765 --> 01:06:45.925
Come on.

739
01:06:48.101 --> 01:06:52.265
Now, I'd say, "Your money or your life,"
but since your money is your life...

740
01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:54.669
How dare you steal from me?

741
01:06:54.841 --> 01:06:56.331
- Don't think of it as stealing.
- No?

742
01:06:56.610 --> 01:06:58.601
Think of it as repossession.

743
01:06:58.679 --> 01:07:01.011
I'll leave you with
what I've had most every day of my life.

744
01:07:01.848 --> 01:07:03.338
- One day.
- One day?

745
01:07:04.518 --> 01:07:05.576
Are you insane?

746
01:07:06.486 --> 01:07:07.475
You can do a lot in a day.

747
01:07:10.791 --> 01:07:12.122
Those are pretty.

748
01:07:18.799 --> 01:07:19.925
I owe you these.

749
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.627
You shouldn't have.

750
01:07:22.302 --> 01:07:23.633
You, out.

751
01:07:30.544 --> 01:07:33.377
<i>Will Salas, prime
suspect in the murder of Henry Hamilton,</i>

752
01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:36.415
<i>is believed to be traveling with Sylvia Weis,</i>

753
01:07:36.483 --> 01:07:38.781
<i>daughter of finance magnate, Philippe Weis.</i>

754
01:07:38.852 --> 01:07:41.116
<i>Citizens are advised to exercise extreme...</i>

755
01:07:44.725 --> 01:07:46.488
We look cute together.

756
01:07:50.497 --> 01:07:52.328
It doesn't say you're wanted.

757
01:07:54.001 --> 01:07:55.832
It doesn't say I'm not.

758
01:07:56.903 --> 01:07:59.235
You've forgotten I shot a cop.

759
01:08:00.507 --> 01:08:02.566
I admit, not very well.

760
01:08:03.343 --> 01:08:04.901
It was your first time.

761
01:08:07.681 --> 01:08:08.670
Hey.

762
01:08:09.016 --> 01:08:11.678
I can say I made you do all of it.

763
01:08:12.686 --> 01:08:14.347
You can go back.

764
01:08:14.588 --> 01:08:16.249
Go back to what?

765
01:08:17.924 --> 01:08:21.860
Do I really want to spend my whole life
trying not to die by mistake?

766
01:08:24.531 --> 01:08:27.261
A lot of people would say
being here is a mistake.

767
01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:31.531
I don't have a choice.

768
01:08:34.541 --> 01:08:36.566
I'm starting to think that I don't, either.

769
01:08:57.798 --> 01:09:01.290
I want to reassure you all
there is no cause for alarm.

770
01:09:01.368 --> 01:09:02.562
No ransom was paid.

771
01:09:02.903 --> 01:09:04.803
<i>Your Zone is at risk, Philippe.</i>

772
01:09:04.905 --> 01:09:07.567
<i>It puts us at risk. It can spread.</i>

773
01:09:07.741 --> 01:09:10.574
<i>Too much time in the wrong hands
can crash the market.</i>

774
01:09:10.811 --> 01:09:12.972
This hostage situation
will be quickly resolved.

775
01:09:13.046 --> 01:09:14.513
Sir.

776
01:09:17.250 --> 01:09:20.651
Everything is under control. We'll talk soon.

777
01:09:27.427 --> 01:09:29.554
Timekeeper. After this regrettable incident,

778
01:09:29.629 --> 01:09:32.427
it's really not necessary
for you to come in person.

779
01:09:33.433 --> 01:09:37.096
I'm afraid it really is necessary.

780
01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:41.830
When can we hope for a rescue?

781
01:09:42.109 --> 01:09:43.906
I believe that's the point.

782
01:09:43.977 --> 01:09:45.842
She doesn't appear to want to be rescued.

783
01:09:47.614 --> 01:09:49.104
Mr. Leon.

784
01:09:50.617 --> 01:09:53.347
Raymond. May I call you Raymond?

785
01:09:55.622 --> 01:09:57.180
I blame myself.

786
01:09:58.191 --> 01:10:00.216
I invited the man into my home.

787
01:10:00.293 --> 01:10:02.284
He had so much time,
how was I supposed to know?

788
01:10:04.131 --> 01:10:08.465
Of course, Sylvia brought this on herself
by her lack of vigilance.

789
01:10:09.035 --> 01:10:11.526
That's why I always tried to keep her close.

790
01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:16.473
But she is clearly under Will Salas' control.

791
01:10:24.651 --> 01:10:26.516
If it's a matter of resources,

792
01:10:27.087 --> 01:10:29.521
I'm happy to make a contribution.

793
01:10:31.324 --> 01:10:33.554
It's a scandal,
what we pay our Timekeepers.

794
01:10:37.330 --> 01:10:39.491
I've issued a warrant
for your daughter's arrest.

795
01:10:40.167 --> 01:10:42.727
If she contacts you
and you assist her in any way,

796
01:10:42.836 --> 01:10:44.667
I will issue a warrant for your arrest.

797
01:10:56.016 --> 01:10:58.348
There is nothing I cannot buy.

798
01:11:00.687 --> 01:11:01.745
Now

799
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:05.251
how many of my years do you want?

800
01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.351
There aren't enough years,

801
01:11:10.530 --> 01:11:14.660
even in your lifetime, Mr. Weis. Good night.

802
01:11:19.873 --> 01:11:22.034
This is called a trigger.

803
01:11:22.742 --> 01:11:26.075
And you don't pull it until
you actually want to shoot something.

804
01:11:33.186 --> 01:11:34.448
I wanted to shoot something.

805
01:11:34.521 --> 01:11:35.545
Right.

806
01:11:40.093 --> 01:11:42.061
Will, if you get a lot of time,

807
01:11:44.364 --> 01:11:45.626
are you really gonna give it away?

808
01:11:46.766 --> 01:11:48.597
I've only ever had a day.

809
01:11:49.536 --> 01:11:51.094
How much do you need?

810
01:11:52.539 --> 01:11:54.200
How can you live with yourself
watching people die

811
01:11:54.274 --> 01:11:55.366
right next to you?

812
01:11:56.943 --> 01:11:58.535
You don't watch.

813
01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:01.370
You close your eyes.

814
01:12:11.057 --> 01:12:13.218
I can help you get all the time you want.

815
01:12:20.767 --> 01:12:23.361
I need to borrow a month.
What's the interest?

816
01:12:24.104 --> 01:12:25.867
Today's rate, 30%.

817
01:12:27.107 --> 01:12:28.597
I can't pay it back.

818
01:12:28.875 --> 01:12:31.036
We can always come to some arrangement.

819
01:12:56.803 --> 01:12:57.963
Let's go.

820
01:13:00.574 --> 01:13:04.271
Ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to
announce that Weis Timelenders

821
01:13:04.344 --> 01:13:07.279
is now offering interest-free
loans with no payments.

822
01:13:07.347 --> 01:13:08.405
Ever.

823
01:13:08.481 --> 01:13:09.971
So help yourselves and take a day.

824
01:13:10.116 --> 01:13:11.640
Take a month. Hell, take a year.

825
01:13:11.818 --> 01:13:13.911
Come on. Help yourselves! Take it.

826
01:13:13.987 --> 01:13:15.454
Take the time. It's free.

827
01:13:50.857 --> 01:13:53.018
No one's watching their clocks, huh?

828
01:13:53.526 --> 01:13:55.892
Get out of here,
or I'll confiscate every second!

829
01:14:03.370 --> 01:14:05.065
Must've thought it was a drive-through.

830
01:14:38.004 --> 01:14:38.993
Turn around.

831
01:14:39.572 --> 01:14:40.596
Don't move.

832
01:14:40.674 --> 01:14:42.266
I don't have much.

833
01:14:42.342 --> 01:14:43.900
Everything I have, I give away.

834
01:14:44.010 --> 01:14:44.999
I know.

835
01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:09.191
Yes, sir, I do know that, sir.

836
01:15:10.704 --> 01:15:12.865
There are years that shouldn't be there.

837
01:15:17.210 --> 01:15:18.871
I will stop him, sir.

838
01:15:20.947 --> 01:15:22.107
Doesn't he understand

839
01:15:22.182 --> 01:15:24.616
he's hurting the very people
he's trying to help?

840
01:15:34.294 --> 01:15:35.625
Well, now.

841
01:15:36.596 --> 01:15:38.564
- Look at all that.
- Yeah.

842
01:15:39.232 --> 01:15:41.063
I finally had time to buy one of these.

843
01:15:43.737 --> 01:15:45.466
Let's not do anything I might regret.

844
01:16:19.105 --> 01:16:20.834
What was that about?

845
01:16:21.708 --> 01:16:23.141
I wasted 30 days.

846
01:16:23.209 --> 01:16:26.804
<i>Today, Sylvia Weis
withdrew some of her "inheritance"</i>

847
01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:29.348
<i>when she and Will Salas
robbed her father's time bank</i>

848
01:16:29.449 --> 01:16:32.009
<i>for the sixth time in a week.</i>

849
01:16:32.852 --> 01:16:33.841
I give her everything.

850
01:16:35.522 --> 01:16:37.114
Does she want to kill me?

851
01:16:37.690 --> 01:16:39.180
You were killing her, Philippe.

852
01:16:41.461 --> 01:16:43.122
You were suffocating her.

853
01:16:45.365 --> 01:16:47.026
You suffocate us all.

854
01:16:51.805 --> 01:16:52.863
Call.

855
01:16:59.145 --> 01:17:00.476
That's good.

856
01:17:01.047 --> 01:17:03.538
Just not as good as that.

857
01:17:03.616 --> 01:17:04.605
Ooh!

858
01:17:05.819 --> 01:17:07.810
You haven't forgotten how to play cards.

859
01:17:08.388 --> 01:17:10.720
Why did I play strip poker with you?

860
01:17:11.324 --> 01:17:12.814
Why did you?

861
01:17:19.032 --> 01:17:20.090
Sir.

862
01:17:20.667 --> 01:17:22.066
They're still there.

863
01:17:23.736 --> 01:17:25.328
How did you know, sir?

864
01:17:26.406 --> 01:17:28.738
This is where the hours and the days are.

865
01:17:30.743 --> 01:17:32.836
He's paid them all off.

866
01:17:33.746 --> 01:17:35.179
This is where I would hide.

867
01:17:43.089 --> 01:17:44.579
Put your clothes on.

868
01:17:51.564 --> 01:17:52.895
Stop!

869
01:17:54.701 --> 01:17:56.532
- We're trapped!
- No, we're not!

870
01:17:58.104 --> 01:17:59.594
Jump. They won't do it.

871
01:17:59.706 --> 01:18:00.764
We shouldn't do it.

872
01:18:07.547 --> 01:18:08.707
Come on!

873
01:18:17.724 --> 01:18:19.783
See? They won't jump.

874
01:18:22.795 --> 01:18:23.921
So much for your theory.

875
01:18:23.997 --> 01:18:25.225
Shit!

876
01:18:41.447 --> 01:18:42.607
Here!

877
01:18:43.082 --> 01:18:44.174
Go!

878
01:18:47.854 --> 01:18:50.015
Stop! Stop!

879
01:19:07.907 --> 01:19:09.431
I'm telling you, he'll give up before we do!

880
01:19:09.509 --> 01:19:10.669
You sure about that?

881
01:19:12.178 --> 01:19:13.509
No.

882
01:19:32.031 --> 01:19:33.362
- Go.
- I can't.

883
01:19:33.466 --> 01:19:34.865
You can! Go!

884
01:19:37.470 --> 01:19:38.596
Un-fucking-believable!

885
01:19:53.219 --> 01:19:54.481
Hold on.

886
01:19:55.388 --> 01:19:56.753
You two look familiar.

887
01:20:00.059 --> 01:20:01.219
How about now?

888
01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:28.853
Welcome to the Century.

889
01:20:29.255 --> 01:20:32.190
Hi. We're looking for a quiet place to stay.

890
01:20:32.959 --> 01:20:33.983
How many rooms?

891
01:20:34.627 --> 01:20:35.651
All of them.

892
01:20:36.462 --> 01:20:38.123
We were hoping for something long-term.

893
01:20:38.865 --> 01:20:41.698
Can we rely on the discretion of your staff?

894
01:20:41.934 --> 01:20:43.925
I'm sure you can.

895
01:20:52.712 --> 01:20:54.543
I'm sorry. We're fully booked.

896
01:20:56.616 --> 01:20:57.947
Right.

897
01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:09.451
Nobody goes anywhere!

898
01:21:09.762 --> 01:21:10.751
Wait, whoa, whoa.

899
01:21:12.565 --> 01:21:13.554
Don't look at me.

900
01:21:15.301 --> 01:21:17.064
You know who I'm looking for.

901
01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:25.574
I'm looking for whoever
gave this man a month!

902
01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:31.973
And I'm gonna clean the clocks off
of every one of you in this hellhole

903
01:21:32.085 --> 01:21:36.613
until someone says something
I want to hear.

904
01:21:44.163 --> 01:21:45.494
I can't hear anything.

905
01:21:49.936 --> 01:21:51.096
Clean it.

906
01:21:52.972 --> 01:21:55.338
No, wait, wait. Wait. Please!

907
01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:58.768
Please don't. Please.
I don't know where they are!

908
01:22:00.046 --> 01:22:01.138
Please.

909
01:22:03.316 --> 01:22:04.578
Please!

910
01:22:05.318 --> 01:22:06.478
Please.

911
01:22:15.228 --> 01:22:16.661
I believe you're next.

912
01:22:17.263 --> 01:22:18.252
Um...

913
01:22:19.732 --> 01:22:22.997
At last, someone's acting reasonably.

914
01:22:23.503 --> 01:22:25.403
I just want a share of the reward.

915
01:22:34.347 --> 01:22:36.008
My young friend.

916
01:22:37.683 --> 01:22:39.674
You'll get your reward.

917
01:22:47.693 --> 01:22:49.024
Ten years.

918
01:22:53.099 --> 01:22:54.760
That's insulting.

919
01:23:00.873 --> 01:23:02.534
If they catch us,

920
01:23:04.377 --> 01:23:07.107
there's no way they won't kill us, is there?

921
01:23:09.715 --> 01:23:11.205
Do you regret this?

922
01:23:12.385 --> 01:23:14.216
You saved my life.

923
01:23:16.556 --> 01:23:17.716
When?

924
01:23:19.559 --> 01:23:20.787
Now.

925
01:23:21.727 --> 01:23:23.718
And every day since I met you.

926
01:23:28.401 --> 01:23:31.131
You forget, I almost got you killed
a few times, too.

927
01:23:33.573 --> 01:23:35.734
I'm willing to overlook that.

928
01:23:52.425 --> 01:23:54.086
How's the poor little rich girl?

929
01:23:55.261 --> 01:23:56.728
I never got a chance to

930
01:23:57.930 --> 01:24:00.091
properly thank you for your time.

931
01:24:01.767 --> 01:24:03.758
I'm not surprised you stayed.

932
01:24:04.270 --> 01:24:06.602
It's the life, isn't it?

933
01:24:07.273 --> 01:24:09.605
Here we don't stop living

934
01:24:09.942 --> 01:24:12.775
until we're actually dead.

935
01:24:14.614 --> 01:24:16.377
There are a lot more ways
to die around here.

936
01:24:17.283 --> 01:24:20.275
But here, there's dancing before dying.

937
01:24:28.127 --> 01:24:31.858
Of course, it's your friend
I'm most happy to run into again.

938
01:24:32.298 --> 01:24:35.631
You've been causing a lot of trouble,
which is normally my job.

939
01:24:36.035 --> 01:24:37.229
Don't you understand?

940
01:24:38.204 --> 01:24:42.800
The reason the Timekeepers leave me alone
is 'cause I have boundaries.

941
01:24:42.875 --> 01:24:45.366
I steal from my own people.

942
01:24:46.212 --> 01:24:49.978
You surely know things are bad
when I have to restore order.

943
01:24:52.985 --> 01:24:57.149
Fortunately for you,
I don't like to kill a man in cold blood.

944
01:24:57.823 --> 01:24:58.983
I do it,

945
01:24:59.492 --> 01:25:03.155
but I prefer not to.

946
01:25:11.570 --> 01:25:13.561
I think you deserve a fighting chance.

947
01:25:20.513 --> 01:25:22.242
We play to zero.

948
01:25:23.249 --> 01:25:24.739
What's the point?

949
01:25:25.351 --> 01:25:29.014
I lose, I die. I win, they kill me.

950
01:25:30.356 --> 01:25:33.519
If you don't fight, I'll kill you now.

951
01:25:34.093 --> 01:25:35.117
And her?

952
01:25:36.529 --> 01:25:38.087
After I take you,

953
01:25:39.031 --> 01:25:40.089
I'll take her.

954
01:25:43.869 --> 01:25:46.201
Oh, yeah. And her time.

955
01:25:47.773 --> 01:25:49.331
Then I'll collect my reward

956
01:25:49.408 --> 01:25:51.876
for making everything right in the world.

957
01:27:13.826 --> 01:27:14.815
This way!

958
01:27:22.835 --> 01:27:24.996
All the time he's taken.

959
01:27:25.838 --> 01:27:27.601
Don't you mean the time
he's given away, sir?

960
01:27:30.676 --> 01:27:32.075
Even to you?

961
01:27:39.852 --> 01:27:44.687
I have given 50 years of my life to this job.

962
01:27:45.524 --> 01:27:48.516
I am not about to see
those years go to waste.

963
01:27:50.429 --> 01:27:51.760
Go on.

964
01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:11.044
I'm sorry to be the one to break this to you,

965
01:28:11.951 --> 01:28:13.612
but by tomorrow

966
01:28:13.886 --> 01:28:15.615
you won't have time to stand around.

967
01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:35.901
God damn it.

968
01:28:39.745 --> 01:28:41.076
It's over.

969
01:28:41.413 --> 01:28:43.313
We lost. We're not doing any good.

970
01:28:43.649 --> 01:28:44.877
At least we're trying.

971
01:28:45.918 --> 01:28:50.252
No. You don't understand. All they have to
do is keep raising the cost of living.

972
01:28:50.589 --> 01:28:54.252
A hundred years. Two. A thousand.
It does nothing.

973
01:28:54.493 --> 01:28:56.085
So, what? We just stop fighting?

974
01:28:56.328 --> 01:28:59.058
We can't win. We can't hurt them.

975
01:28:59.131 --> 01:29:01.065
The time we're taking
makes no damn difference!

976
01:29:01.133 --> 01:29:03.260
What would? What would hurt them?

977
01:29:03.836 --> 01:29:07.431
A million years.
You got a million years on you?

978
01:29:11.610 --> 01:29:14.101
I guess it really would take a million years.

979
01:29:18.183 --> 01:29:19.445
Let's give up.

980
01:29:46.211 --> 01:29:47.542
Stop!

981
01:29:49.214 --> 01:29:50.647
I am Sylvia Weis.

982
01:29:52.985 --> 01:29:54.646
I want to surrender,

983
01:29:55.321 --> 01:29:56.948
but only to my father.

984
01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:02.684
Sylvia.

985
01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:06.297
Hello, Daddy.

986
01:30:09.134 --> 01:30:10.226
Stay where you are!

987
01:30:12.237 --> 01:30:14.501
You've hired more guards
since I last saw you.

988
01:30:14.607 --> 01:30:15.904
Thanks to you, I need them.

989
01:30:16.508 --> 01:30:17.839
One too many.

990
01:30:19.545 --> 01:30:20.773
Guns down.

991
01:30:22.348 --> 01:30:23.508
Now!

992
01:30:24.316 --> 01:30:25.305
Do it.

993
01:30:35.861 --> 01:30:37.624
Let's go for a ride.

994
01:30:45.037 --> 01:30:47.198
You'd steal from your own father.

995
01:30:47.539 --> 01:30:50.030
Is it stealing if it's already stolen?

996
01:31:04.723 --> 01:31:06.190
What's the combination?

997
01:31:07.292 --> 01:31:09.226
Well, it's not my birthday.

998
01:31:09.294 --> 01:31:12.457
You've started to regret that day,
I imagine, Father.

999
01:31:13.732 --> 01:31:16.394
Try 12-2-18-09.

1000
01:31:17.970 --> 01:31:19.733
Darwin's birthday.

1001
01:31:21.807 --> 01:31:23.570
Survival of the fittest.

1002
01:31:26.045 --> 01:31:28.946
It cost us centuries
just to bribe our way in here.

1003
01:31:29.748 --> 01:31:31.238
Let's see what it got us.

1004
01:31:48.267 --> 01:31:49.757
Quality time.

1005
01:31:51.603 --> 01:31:54.265
There really is a man with a million years.

1006
01:31:54.339 --> 01:31:57.172
That's my first million. It won't be my last.

1007
01:31:57.276 --> 01:31:58.607
You know how much good it could do?

1008
01:31:58.677 --> 01:32:00.611
I know how much harm it could do.

1009
01:32:00.679 --> 01:32:03.477
Try to understand,
even if you gave a year to a million people,

1010
01:32:03.549 --> 01:32:04.948
you're just prolonging their agony.

1011
01:32:05.017 --> 01:32:06.951
You're prolonging their lives.

1012
01:32:07.453 --> 01:32:11.446
Flooding the wrong Zone with a million
years, it could cripple the system.

1013
01:32:11.523 --> 01:32:12.854
Let's hope so.

1014
01:32:12.958 --> 01:32:17.122
We're not meant to live like this.
We're not meant to live forever.

1015
01:32:18.030 --> 01:32:22.262
Although I do wonder, Father,
if you've ever lived a day in your life.

1016
01:32:22.801 --> 01:32:27.135
Is that so? You might upset
the balance for a generation.

1017
01:32:27.639 --> 01:32:28.799
Two.

1018
01:32:29.808 --> 01:32:32.800
But don't fool yourself.
In the end, nothing will change.

1019
01:32:33.645 --> 01:32:35.636
Because everyone wants to live forever.

1020
01:32:37.049 --> 01:32:39.950
They all think they have
a chance at immortality

1021
01:32:40.018 --> 01:32:41.349
even though all the evidence is against it.

1022
01:32:43.489 --> 01:32:45.582
They all think they will be the exception.

1023
01:32:45.657 --> 01:32:48.148
But the truth is,

1024
01:32:48.494 --> 01:32:50.621
for a few to be immortal, many must die.

1025
01:33:07.012 --> 01:33:09.845
No one should be immortal

1026
01:33:10.682 --> 01:33:12.912
if even one person has to die.

1027
01:33:27.699 --> 01:33:29.098
What was that?

1028
01:33:29.868 --> 01:33:32.359
What was that? What just happened?

1029
01:33:34.439 --> 01:33:37.431
It must be a mistake. A million years
just went off the clock in New Greenwich.

1030
01:33:37.543 --> 01:33:38.771
It's not a mistake.

1031
01:33:39.044 --> 01:33:40.033
It's gotta be a mistake, sir.

1032
01:33:40.112 --> 01:33:41.272
It's not a mistake.

1033
01:33:43.015 --> 01:33:44.073
It's them.

1034
01:33:49.054 --> 01:33:50.112
Take a month, Maurice.

1035
01:34:06.805 --> 01:34:08.830
Dispatch, what can you see?

1036
01:34:08.907 --> 01:34:10.534
<i>There's a lot of traffic
in the vicinity, sir.</i>

1037
01:34:10.609 --> 01:34:12.839
All right, look for the slowest car.

1038
01:34:13.979 --> 01:34:18.416
You have a million years.
You are definitely not in a hurry.

1039
01:34:21.086 --> 01:34:22.747
If this works...

1040
01:34:22.988 --> 01:34:25.252
If this works, we gotta get more.

1041
01:34:25.657 --> 01:34:28.319
Dayton's not the only zone that
can use a few extra years.

1042
01:34:31.096 --> 01:34:33.087
And wire me my per diem.

1043
01:34:33.165 --> 01:34:34.655
Wait. Never mind.

1044
01:34:34.766 --> 01:34:36.097
I have him.

1045
01:34:43.775 --> 01:34:45.766
Give the order, shoot on sight.

1046
01:34:45.844 --> 01:34:48.005
<i>In New Greenwich?
That's against policy, sir.</i>

1047
01:34:48.113 --> 01:34:50.343
So is having a million years leave the Zone.

1048
01:35:08.166 --> 01:35:10.498
That time cannot leave the Zone!
Shoot on sight!

1049
01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:38.952
<i>Please deposit
one month. Please deposit one month.</i>

1050
01:35:51.576 --> 01:35:53.203
Keep going! Keep going!

1051
01:35:53.278 --> 01:35:54.336
We're close!

1052
01:35:54.913 --> 01:35:56.244
We're okay! We're okay!

1053
01:36:10.762 --> 01:36:11.786
You're late.

1054
01:36:14.199 --> 01:36:15.291
Need a minute?

1055
01:36:18.036 --> 01:36:19.435
Go. Go.

1056
01:36:20.706 --> 01:36:22.298
Where's our capsule?

1057
01:36:22.741 --> 01:36:23.867
Too late.

1058
01:36:29.381 --> 01:36:30.973
Lost a lot of time, Mr. Leon.

1059
01:36:31.383 --> 01:36:33.214
Looks like you're about out yourself.

1060
01:36:36.688 --> 01:36:37.882
- Time!
- There's time!

1061
01:36:37.956 --> 01:36:38.980
Move!

1062
01:36:56.074 --> 01:36:57.405
Move!

1063
01:37:01.413 --> 01:37:03.904
You, get out! Get out!

1064
01:37:20.098 --> 01:37:21.929
We gotta get to Livingston.

1065
01:37:23.769 --> 01:37:25.066
We can make it.

1066
01:37:25.137 --> 01:37:26.263
Can we?

1067
01:37:34.780 --> 01:37:35.940
You okay?

1068
01:38:02.707 --> 01:38:04.038
Stop!

1069
01:38:10.816 --> 01:38:11.942
You can run.

1070
01:38:14.052 --> 01:38:15.451
So can you.

1071
01:38:18.156 --> 01:38:19.953
You're from here, aren't you?

1072
01:38:22.494 --> 01:38:24.018
Long time ago.

1073
01:38:24.596 --> 01:38:25.585
Yeah.

1074
01:38:26.064 --> 01:38:27.964
I worked out how to escape.

1075
01:38:28.233 --> 01:38:30.565
And now you make sure no one else does.

1076
01:38:30.635 --> 01:38:32.159
That's the way it has to be.

1077
01:38:34.005 --> 01:38:35.836
I didn't start the clock.

1078
01:38:37.342 --> 01:38:38.969
I can't turn it back.

1079
01:38:40.512 --> 01:38:41.843
I keep it running.

1080
01:38:42.681 --> 01:38:43.978
I keep time.

1081
01:38:45.183 --> 01:38:46.844
"I keep time."

1082
01:38:51.189 --> 01:38:53.817
I'm gonna need some of that time
you borrowed from me.

1083
01:38:56.528 --> 01:38:59.588
Unless you want us to die
on the way to our execution.

1084
01:39:04.202 --> 01:39:05.533
Time.

1085
01:39:27.792 --> 01:39:29.282
We don't have enough.

1086
01:39:32.731 --> 01:39:34.790
One of us can make it. Take mine.

1087
01:39:35.066 --> 01:39:38.035
You take mine. You can get there, I can't!
I can't get there. You can.

1088
01:39:38.103 --> 01:39:40.367
- No. No.
- Yes!

1089
01:39:41.907 --> 01:39:43.067
Please.

1090
01:39:43.408 --> 01:39:44.568
No.

1091
01:39:54.252 --> 01:39:55.583
There's time.

1092
01:39:56.021 --> 01:39:58.455
- What?
- The Keeper's time. Run. Run!

1093
01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:09.831
Run!

1094
01:40:23.615 --> 01:40:24.604
I need time.

1095
01:40:24.683 --> 01:40:26.446
<i>Time transfer.</i>

1096
01:40:50.108 --> 01:40:51.439
What have we got?

1097
01:40:52.611 --> 01:40:53.873
A day.

1098
01:40:54.679 --> 01:40:56.010
Could do a lot in a day.

1099
01:41:11.529 --> 01:41:13.793
Sir, do something.

1100
01:41:15.634 --> 01:41:17.295
It's already done.

1101
01:41:18.169 --> 01:41:20.364
<i>These are
live pictures from Dayton.</i>

1102
01:41:20.438 --> 01:41:22.565
<i>Citizens have taken to the streets.</i>

1103
01:41:22.674 --> 01:41:25.165
<i>There's so much stolen time in circulation.</i>

1104
01:41:25.510 --> 01:41:27.307
<i>Factories in Dayton lie idle.</i>

1105
01:41:27.545 --> 01:41:29.672
<i>And now, citizens are crossing Zones,</i>

1106
01:41:29.748 --> 01:41:31.215
<i>seen here entering New Greenwich.</i>

1107
01:41:31.850 --> 01:41:34.341
<i>While authorities claim
they have the situation</i>

1108
01:41:34.419 --> 01:41:38.685
<i>under control, others fear the system
may be headed for collapse.</i>

1109
01:41:38.757 --> 01:41:41.783
<i>We will continue to update you
on this developing story.</i>

1110
01:41:42.193 --> 01:41:43.888
Sir, we lost Zone Eight.

1111
01:41:43.962 --> 01:41:44.986
And Ten.

1112
01:41:49.334 --> 01:41:50.892
It's spreading.

1113
01:41:52.570 --> 01:41:53.798
What do we do, sir?

1114
01:41:55.340 --> 01:41:56.671
Go home.

1115
01:42:05.183 --> 01:42:09.449
<i>Still no sign of
fugitives Will Salas and Sylvia Weis.</i>

1116
01:42:09.554 --> 01:42:12.114
<i>Authorities continue to ask
for the public's help</i>

1117
01:42:12.190 --> 01:42:15.216
<i>in bringing these criminals to justice.</i>

1118
01:42:34.279 --> 01:42:35.940
Told you there were bigger banks.

1119
01:42:37.882 --> 01:42:39.213
You almost missed your calling.

1120
01:42:39.237 --> 01:42:41.237
