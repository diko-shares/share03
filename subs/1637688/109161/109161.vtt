<i>Final Episode</i>

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,720
Mom.

6
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,850
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,660
No matter how scared I was, I shouldn't have left you.

8
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,120
I should have, somehow, protected stayed by you and protected you.

9
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,480
It's fine.

10
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,390
I'm more sorry, Mom,

11
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,080
that I couldn't help you even once then.

12
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:05,950
Now I can protect you Mom. I'm all grown up.

13
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,030
I know right.

14
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,020
When did my son grow up like this?

15
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,600
I am Park No Ah, the one who called. I'm Sang Tae's homeroom teacher.

16
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,580
I'm Sang Tae's classmate...Ah Ran's mother.

17
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:35,550
Yes, I saw both your faces on the news.

18
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:40,040
I was also watching the events that took place at Myeong Seong High.

19
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,000
I apologize for being late.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,990
Not at all. For now, let's go to my house.

21
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:49,180
I will fill you in on the details there. Let's go.

22
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,890
It is Ms. Han Mi Joo. What should I do?

23
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,870
Sang Tae, this punk!

24
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,170
Of all the things, he drags his mom in?

25
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,730
Bring them both to me. RIGHT NOW!

26
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,180
Ah, hello.

27
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,910
I'm Bang Wool's Moth...ah, I'm Jo Kang Ja's friend.

28
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,280
-Mom, hurry up and get in! <b>- Who is it?</b>

29
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,660
It's Father's secretary. Hurry, hurry!

30
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,810
Sang Tae, you come too!

31
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,890
You all go first. Teacher, go!

32
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,250
Sang Tae!

33
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,850
Where do you think you're going!?

34
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,610
We have to take Sang Tae too!

35
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,310
Sang Tae will be fine. After all, it's his Father.

36
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,870
Let go! I said let go!

37
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,770
Hong Sang Tae, are you of your right mind right now or not?

38
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:09,580
Where in the world is a son that would stab his father in the back, you punk?

39
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,890
In that case, where in the world is a father who beats up a mother like that?

40
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,470
Kids have died, but he will live all by himself, and be comfortable!

41
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:22,730
Do you think I'm doing all this for my sake? I'm doing it all for your sake!

42
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,530
For my sake? Don't say that it's for my sake, Father.

43
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,730
Because then I would want to die.

44
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,060
I would have to die in order for you to stop.

45
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,870
This idiot of a son.

46
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,190
You're just like your mother!

47
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,900
-You, where's your cellphone? Where is it? <b>-I don't want to.</b>

48
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,110
-Give it to me! <b>-I don't want to!</b>

49
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,170
This punk! Give it to me!

50
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,720
You, until this trial is finished, don't take even a step out of here!

51
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,410
Stay just like that! This punk!

52
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,320
Han Mi Joo, the day she opens her mouth...

53
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,280
<i>Mom</i>

54
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,990
<i>My Son</i>

55
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,960
Sang Tae, are you alright?

56
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,810
<i>Do you think he would okay?!</i>

57
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,820
<i>When he's stabbed his father in the back?</i>

58
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,550
Sang Tae's Father, don't do that to Sang Tae. Don't do anything to the child.

59
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,650
That depends on you.

60
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,700
You... You know I don't say empty words, right?!

61
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:48,200
If you don't want to see your son die, then close that mouth.

62
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,380
What does President Hong say? Is he threatening Sang Tae?

63
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,450
I don't think I can do it. I can't testify.

64
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,430
Sang Tae's Mother...

65
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:06,390
I'm really sorry Teacher. I'm very sorry towards the parents of the children that were in the accident but

66
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:11,350
I can't lose my son, too. I'm sorry.

67
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,790
Exc-

68
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:21,650
It's my fault for not being able to raise him with a sense of decency.

69
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,380
Feeling sorry that I couldn't hug him often,

70
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,510
I have taught my child wrong.

71
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,250
I'll take up the rod now.

72
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,890
I will make the discipline hard.

73
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,470
If someone were to commit a crime,

74
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,210
regardless of that person's status,

75
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,960
the world [should] punish the person fully in the face of the law.

76
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,730
<i>Even if that person were to be my son,</i>

77
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:52,140
<i>even if that person were to be the son of the President or of a high ranking official,</i>

78
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:57,760
<i>if a person were to commit a crime, we should become the country where he/she can face an appropriate punishment.</i>

79
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,910
<i>The crime the Director of the Myeong Seong Foundation Board Do Jeong Woo committed this time,</i>

80
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:07,080
is an inexcusable and serious crime of murder,

81
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:16,380
hence I request the court that the maximum punishment the law allows be dealt to him.

82
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,400
I apologize.

83
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,970
Power is quite cold-hearted.

84
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,400
Right?

85
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,740
Can I make just one phone call?

86
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,670
Hello?

87
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,810
<i>It's me Do Jeong Woo.</i>

88
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,850
Is there something else still left between us?

89
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,380
Ae Yeon, please come visit me just once.

90
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,110
Are we in that kind of relationship?

91
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:08,090
Let's meet just once. Please meet me once without Chairman Hong's knowledge.

92
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:13,000
If you need someone to care for you, fine another woman.

93
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,880
<i>Ae Yeon.</i>

94
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:24,030
<i>The truth is that day, the last time we ate out together,</i>

95
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:29,130
<i>there was a gift I had wanted to give to you, but couldn't because I didn't have the courage.</i>

96
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,430
<i>I really regret that.</i>

97
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:36,260
Even without me, you can go to Mr. Kim and

98
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:40,910
you can give my name and drink wine and live well.

99
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:44,110
Unlike a guy like me or Chairman Hong,

100
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,000
<i>I hope you meet a really good guy.</i>

101
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,320
As expected, everything was inside the vault.

102
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,200
That's great!

103
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,660
The ledger?

104
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:11,960
A bigger problem than that has surfaced.

105
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,350
Han Mi Joo has returned. She is at Judge Park's house.

106
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,870
What are you talking about?

107
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,250
How can you take care of your business like that?

108
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:25,230
If she opens her mouth, you know what will happen to me and you.

109
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:29,550
For her son's sake, she won't be able to open (her mouth) easily.

110
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,800
You know well that she hasn't been able to speak a word of it<b>for the past 10 years.</b>

111
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,530
She's a woman who cowers even at the sound of my voice.

112
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:40,100
That's not it at all. Even a mouse cornered will bite a cat.

113
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:45,070
Gently persuade and bring her home. I'll meet her myself and talk to her.

114
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,970
She's my daughter.

115
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,280
She is...Yi Kyeong.

116
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,060
I did the same thing you did.

117
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:19,780
When Ah Ran's mother said she was going to catch the ones that made my child like that

118
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:24,460
I ran away because I thought I would lose my child that I had left.

119
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,030
That's why I...know you heart all too well.

120
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,630
Then, how did you change your mind?

121
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:38,410
Yi Kyeong's little bother said this as he watched the news,

122
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,030
"That's the school Big Sister attended."

123
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:47,760
"If she was alive, she could have died, too."

124
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,730
"If I attended that school, I would have died, too."

125
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,360
It felt like someone had hit me on the back of my head.

126
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,920
If it's really for the sake of my child, I shouldn't be covering things up

127
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,490
but rather fighting and protecting. I had that kind of thought.

128
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,400
Not after he's dead,

129
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,240
while he's alive.

130
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,710
What's going on?

131
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,240
Let's go get Sang Tae.

132
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,970
You have the right to get him, Sang Tae's Mom.

133
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:26,690
Legally, the ones who threatened the witness or the relative<b>can be arrested on the spot.</b>

134
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,540
Don't be afraid and let's get him.

135
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:33,510
You know very well that he doesn't listen to things like the law. It's obvious that he won't let him out.

136
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:37,800
He doesn't then we need to fight him. We should fight and protect him.

137
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,340
You're Sang Tae's mom.

138
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,420
He's the father.

139
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,650
What is this?!

140
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:04,020
I told you to stay quiet. How dare you come here with the police?!

141
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,250
I came to get my son.

142
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,090
Your son?

143
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:12,480
When was it when you left, saying you would live alone?

144
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,530
Get out! Everyone get out of my house!

145
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,980
I'm sorry, but there's a been a report that you threaten your son frequently.

146
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:22,340
After we confirm that's not the case...<b>- To which station do you belong? Provide your information!</b>

147
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,310
Reporter Jeong Hye Jin of NBS broadcasting company.

148
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,320
I heard that your son is locked up. Is that true?

149
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,110
HEY! How dare a reporter come here...

150
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,030
Chairman Hong...

151
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,450
This is really...

152
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,320
Sang Tae! Are you inside?

153
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,070
Teacher?!

154
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,070
Is it you, Teacher?

155
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,410
Sang Tae, get away from the door.

156
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,480
Yes.

157
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:13,440
Are you okay Sang Tae? Are you hurt?

158
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,260
Teacher...

159
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:21,240
I've never seen a person like you in my life.

160
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:25,420
Like you've lived all that long...

161
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:34,840
I wish we could have had a discussion like this before, but

162
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,710
there hadn't been an opportunity.

163
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:43,710
How upset you must have been to get personally involved like this.

164
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:47,490
I understand that feeling more than anyone else.

165
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:53,040
How can someone who treat his son like a stain on his flesh understand us?

166
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:59,450
We know your two face very well, so take off your mask and just tell us what you want.

167
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:07,170
Then I'll just tell you why I called you here.

168
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,480
If it's not enough, I can cut a blank check.

169
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,950
You just need to keep your mouths closed.

170
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,460
Your son killed my daughter. That young child!

171
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:28,940
Such a cruel thing. I will treat it as the charge of murder to arrange for the maximum punishment.

172
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:33,070
Candidate Kang Soo Chan! Your unending greed

173
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:38,590
has made your son into a monster and killed our children.

174
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:42,310
So how is it that you don't even show a remote remorse...

175
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:47,830
Your husband died, right? You feel wronged and resentful, don't you?

176
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,750
I'll help you release that.

177
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,470
I'll raise your daughter with the best resources in Korea.

178
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:04,600
Madam Han, this country's well-being and your son's life hang on the balance of your mouth.

179
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:11,020
A mother shouldn't throw ashes on her son's life which is guaranteed to be fast-tracked and succeed, right?

180
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:18,970
Live with your mouth closed. Continue to live as you've lived. That's the best for you son.

181
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,510
I'll decide my own fate.

182
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:27,240
Hong Sang Tae! You would dare to butt in on adults' conversation? Wait outside.

183
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,810
Sang Tae, are you alright?

184
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,370
Yeah, I'm fine. Why did you come here?

185
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,930
I came to get you. Let's go quickly.

186
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:38,360
You two stay still.

187
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,160
You can come in as your please, but when you leave,

188
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,430
you can't leave without my permission. Sit still unless you want to die!

189
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:49,180
If we don't leave, it will become an exclusive news item tomorrow.

190
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,530
The reporters are all outside.

191
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:55,610
Do you think we would have come into a tiger's lair without some preparation?

192
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,710
I still have power to control (block news) that much!

193
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:02,180
I have quite a few reporters around me who can't be controlled.

194
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,450
The police is here and we've even applied for witness protection.

195
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,670
You...!

196
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,280
Let's go.

197
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,330
Hong Sang Tae, think carefully.

198
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:19,690
You're my son. You're Hong Sang Bok's son, Hong Sang Tae.

199
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:24,090
There are no sons that betray their father.

200
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,690
Mom, I'll just stay here.

201
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,790
Sang Tae!

202
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,980
It will be pitiful to Father if I leave, too.

203
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,900
Mom, go and do what you need to do. I'll do what a son needs to do.

204
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,630
- Sang Tae... <b> - Don't worry, Mom.</b>

205
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:52,300
Dad won't hit me. He'll only lock me up in the room.

206
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,420
He'll feed me daily and even give me health tonics.

207
00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:00,320
Han Mi Joo, if you leave, I won't give it to him.

208
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,420
If you want to see your son starve to death, go ahead and leave!

209
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,850
Go ahead and leave!

210
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:10,590
He's just saying that. I'm not scared of Dad. Don't worry, Mom.

211
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:14,160
So, go what you need to do.

212
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:22,870
Teacher, please escort my mom and leave. I need to stay by my dad's side.

213
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,540
Ugh.

214
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,480
The witness has gone over to the other side.

215
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,660
Prosecutor Jeong will arrest me additionally.

216
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,290
Please allow me to hang in until the election.

217
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:07,950
I said I'd take the ledger and meet him in person to put an end to this.

218
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,790
Just delay it for one week!

219
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,070
Bring me the ledger.

220
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,650
Ah, yes... well...

221
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:23,460
I've moved it to the bank safe deposit.

222
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,960
You know this place would runs the risk of the residential search.

223
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,520
Make sure to bring it to my office first thing tomorrow morning.

224
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,020
Yes, Candidate.

225
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,230
Yes, Candidate. It's Hong Sang Bok.

226
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,000
<i>2005 Myeong Seong High School.</i>

227
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:13,880
<i>The truth is, the last night we went out to eat,</i>

228
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,540
<i>I wanted to present you with a gift, but I didn't have the courage to give it to you.</i>

229
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,950
<i>I really regret it now.</i>

230
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,070
<i>Even without me, please go see Mr. Kim often and</i>

231
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:30,730
<i> give my name and drink some wine and live well.</i>

232
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,740
This is the petition for Gang Soo Chan's additional arrest.

233
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,450
What's going on that you're easily stamping (signing) it?

234
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:50,290
Since the witness is precise.

235
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,760
Since you've stamped it, then this one, too...

236
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,480
<i>Seoul Regional Prosecution Office<b>Subject: request for warrant to seize, search, and investigate.</i></b>

237
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,210
Wait on this one a little longer.

238
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,630
We need to quickly search Myeong Seong Foundation's secret vault.

239
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,580
There's a high probability of Chairman Hong manipulating the evidence.

240
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,310
I told you to wait.

241
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,150
Excuse me... Do you remember me?

242
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:25,520
I came here before with Do Jeong Woo.

243
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,730
Ah, yes.

244
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:31,470
You're Head Director's fiancee.

245
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:41,000
Jeong Woo said I could come here anytime and have some wine.

246
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,210
Of course.

247
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:47,580
In any case, there's something the director left here

248
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,080
and I was waiting to see when you would stop by.

249
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,260
Just a minute.

250
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:34,730
<i>I wanted to put it on you with my own hands but I end up giving it to you like this.</i>

251
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,510
<i>It will look very good on you.</i>

252
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,340
<i>I hope to see you wearing this necklace in court.</i>

253
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:49,000
<i>It's the best gift you could give to me and revenge.</i>

254
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,640
<i>Candidate Gang Soo Chan was additionally arrested in connection to the Myeongseong Collapse Tragedy.</i>

255
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:18,020
<i>The prosecution believes that the vast amount of Myengseong Foundation and the construction fund has been through the wife of Chairman Hong, Ms. Han Mi Joo's account</i>

256
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,330
<i>as the campaign fund for the Presidential candidate, Gang Soo Chan.</i>

257
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:26,520
<i>In the content of Ms. Han Mi Joo's record of negotiation showed many high profile officials' connection to this that</i>

258
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,970
<i>considerable impact on the political circles based on this trial's outcome.</i>

259
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:35,790
<i>There isn't familiarity to prompt an exchange of funds between the candidate Gang Soo Chan and us.</i>

260
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,950
<i>We have not received a single cent from the candidate Gang.</i>

261
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:44,860
<i>That person, aside from graduating from the same elementary school, we have no other special connection.</i>

262
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,180
<i>Of course, I have never met him.</i>

263
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:51,120
Exchange of monies at the time of election is unfathomable idea.

264
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,570
This situation appears to have been sparked based on<b>the internal conflict between the Myeongseong Foundation's Chairman Hong Sang Bok</b>

265
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:59,510
and the candidate Gang Soo Chan...

266
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:03,620
Hong Sang Bok that bastard stabbed me in the back.<b>The thing I asked you to prepare?</b>

267
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,720
Yes, Sir. We're trying to ensure we come up to scratch on the funds...

268
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,750
Match it the best that you can.

269
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,150
And confirm whether the ledger has gone into the three candidates proceedings.

270
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,570
Yes.

271
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:21,840
That account, is something that my husband without my knowledge

272
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,580
it's Kang Soo Chan's secret account.

273
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:32,720
In the middle of the process of the divorce between my husband and I, my legal representative told me.

274
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,260
When I questioned about it, he found me in the US and using violence against me and

275
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:43,470
holding my son as hostage, he threatened me in order to close my mouth.

276
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:47,630
But then, how did you come to change your mind to testify?

277
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:55,600
I, too... am a mother.

278
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,730
The school collapsed,

279
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:05,080
and with kids dying, I could no longer stay silent.

280
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,210
Because he is my child's father, no...

281
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:14,400
It is because he is my child's father all the more I had to block it.

282
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:20,460
My son could have been a lead in that tragedy.

283
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,230
If ignored,

284
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:27,210
my son could have also become a monster who's created that tragedy so

285
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,560
I had to do whatever I could to block it.

286
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:35,210
That! You call yourself a mother! The one who ruined your son is you!

287
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:39,200
<i>Shut your mouth and sit down! This is the court!</i>

288
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,370
I guess having a rich father isn't all good.

289
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,780
Yes.

290
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,060
Right now?

291
00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:00,530
I get it. I will let the prosecutor know. Hurry and come.

292
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:05,460
Looking at it commonsensically, if that account belongs to Chairman Hong's former wife,

293
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,830
wouldn't it be valid to say that Chairman Hong has appropriated it?

294
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:15,370
So if you were to connect it to me, it's a huge leap in conclusion.

295
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:19,320
With my political life as the deposit, I swear that money in the account

296
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,090
Never mind spending it, I have never even known of that money.

297
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:27,390
The funds used for your election campaign alone, thus far, is estimated to approximately W35,000,000,000 ($35MM).

298
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:32,490
This amount surpasses the candidate Jang's publicly announced private assets last April.

299
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,990
That money, where did it come from?

300
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:42,130
I have just lived all my life as an educator so I am not very good at those numbers at all.

301
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,530
There is a separate department that handles the campaign fund

302
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:48,790
within the presidential election campaign, so I'll submit the data additionally.

303
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,110
People like us,

304
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:55,580
what power would we have when faced with political power?

305
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:00,150
If we don't supply the fund, we will penalize your school he says.

306
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:05,200
There will be some payback to the foundation, he says.

307
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,110
My wife whom I'm separated from, I had to resort to borrowing her name

308
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:14,810
in order to fund the campaign, didn't I?

309
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,580
This is a slander!

310
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:20,410
Hong Sang Bok received money from my opponent

311
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,630
and is setting the trap to slander me!

312
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,990
Setting the trap? What trap?

313
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:28,330
As the Prosecutor is asking with the evidence, I'd have you know.

314
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,980
If you were to compare the account's transactions

315
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,710
and the Candidate Jang's political transverse

316
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:36,840
one by one, then it'll all become clear, so

317
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,350
Why are you lying?

318
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,850
Both of you answer what is asked!

319
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:45,140
What right did you do for you to be shouting?<b>Everyone is watching!</b>

320
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,830
I thought the two of them would come out like this so

321
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:50,700
I brought a witness to testify that these two are accomplices.

322
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:56,200
As the witness is under an indictment on a separate charge, I request that court grant latitude in this matter.

323
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,740
I'm not helping because I favor you.

324
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:27,600
You look pretty today.

325
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,450
Under Gang Soo Chan and Hong Sang Bok's orders, embezzling the construction fund

326
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:46,550
and depositing it into Han Mi Joo's account is me.

327
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,220
The money I sent to Han Mi Joo's account

328
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:53,140
was flowed through Gang Soo Chan's senior secretary account as the campaign fund.

329
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,140
I object!

330
00:26:55,140 --> 00:27:00,110
Right now, Do Jeong Woo is in trial for murder therefore his testimony is not reliable

331
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:03,460
In addition, he has harbored ill feelings towards his biological father

332
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:07,700
and threatened his biological father several times to have rise to the ranks of the Board Director.

333
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,490
I request a recess so in order I may submit that evidence.

334
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:15,050
The one that threatens as the matter of course is my father and not me.

335
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,230
I have just submitted that evidence.

336
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,360
<i>You said you wouldn't contact me again, but how many times has it been?</i>

337
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,850
<i>I won't be able to even if want to anymore.</i>

338
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:34,680
<i>I... have cancer. I don't even have a month left.</i>

339
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,040
<i>So?</i>

340
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,490
That's illegal evidence.

341
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,280
Please have them stop it, Judge.

342
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,550
<i>please put him on the family registry.</i>

343
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:46,160
<i>Why is he my son? I told you to get rid of him, you said you got rid of him.</i>

344
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,070
<i>You deceived me and had him behind my back</i>

345
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:52,290
<i>Using him as an excuse, you've tormented my whole life..</i>

346
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,620
<i>That's why I raised him alone.</i>

347
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,520
<i>You asked for me to live as if I were dead and so I did.</i>

348
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,280
<i>Now I'm really about to die, you can't even grant my request to take in your own bloodline?</i>

349
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:07,730
<i>Stop talking about bloodline! He has always been a stain and disgrace in my life.</i>

350
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:11,440
<i>A stain I would like to cut from my flesh and erase!</i>

351
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,870
<i>He's your son. Kang Soo Chan's son, Do Jeong Woo!</i>

352
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:20,800
<i>If you don't acknowledge him to the end, I'll take this and</i>

353
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,630
<i>go to the press!</i>

354
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:29,370
<i>If you want to shackle your son's ankle and enter the casket with him, you can do whatever you want.</i>

355
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,820
<i>It's not hard for me to have you disappear without a trace.</i>

356
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:53,080
The one who made me into a monster is you father.

357
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,600
Even just once, if you acknowledged me as your son

358
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:03,000
just even once, if you just loved my mother sincerely

359
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,130
I wouldn't have turned out to be like this.

360
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:08,380
This bastard has ruined my life!

361
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,530
This damned bastard!

362
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:15,010
You!!! I should have killed you already!

363
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,800
A monster made a monster.

364
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,030
That damned!

365
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,130
I will see you again in jail.

366
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:57,340
I'm sick of you.

367
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,600
I will be going first and will be waiting for you, Father.

368
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,260
Prepare for the appeal, okay?

369
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,770
Instruct the presidential election accountants to match up the facts.

370
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:15,850
I will see that Elder, so block the media quickly, okay?

371
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:20,370
I need to meet him. I need to meet him.

372
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:32,280
Why are you loitering around the court? I told you to stay at home, you punk!

373
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:37,430
This punk takes after his mother so he disgustingly doesn't listen to me!

374
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:43,260
There's nothing to worry about. Your dad is Hong Sang Bok.

375
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,840
I won't die easily.

376
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,810
If I grow up, do I become like Teacher Do Jeong Woo?

377
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:51,920
What did you say?

378
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,120
That's why you should have lived properly Father!

379
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:02,410
When I look at those two, I see us in the future. So, I'm scared.

380
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:11,570
What did that punk say?

381
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:47,960
There doesn't seem to exist Jeong Hyeong Sik's ledger, Prosecutor.

382
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:51,800
The accused Hong Sang Bok conspired with Jang Soo Chan

383
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:57,450
to compose a political slush fund, and forced the rough-and-ready consturction of Myeong Seong High's annex building which brought about the collapse of a building.

384
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:03,310
In addition, along with the Board Director Do Jeong Woo, despite the warning of potential building collapse,

385
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:07,100
did not even make the minimal preventative measure to run an evacuation announcement that

386
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:10,770
it resulted in 18 injured

387
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,940
and 6 dead.

388
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:17,760
17 and 18.

389
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,570
They were children who have not even begun to bloom (get older).

390
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:27,820
Despite that, these three people were busy shoving the responsibility to one another instead of showing any change of heart,

391
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:32,580
and have left the bereaved families with irrevocable heartache.

392
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:38,560
And as the person in the highest position of Education, the accused Jang Soo Chan who is required to possess the highest moral fiber

393
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,380
fronted his out-of-wedlock-son, and embezzled the construction fund,

394
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:46,180
and exhibited the hideous deed of using the money as his campaign fund.

395
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:52,990
His son, the accused Do Jeong Woo not only pushed the student who discovered his corruption to death,

396
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:57,800
but also transferring that crime to yet another student and such,

397
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,400
and committed simply the most atrocious and brutal crime.

398
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:09,160
The Myeong Seong Collapse Tragedy is an extreme example that displayed a gruesome spectacle of the Republic of Korea's reality which is rotten to the roots (core),

399
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:13,850
and it isn't a simple collapse of one school, but rather

400
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:20,990
the present state of our nation where the trust and hope of our nation has collapsed.

401
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:27,120
Without carving out the rotten root, no living organism can revive itself.

402
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:34,260
As such, Prosecution would like to issue the maximum punishment that Prosecution is permitted

403
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:39,340
to those who have shaken the root of trust and hope.

404
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:47,530
I plead 7 year in prison for the accused Jang Soo Chan

405
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,710
for the violation of special finance rule and the abuse of power of the office.

406
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:56,890
I plead 6 years in prison for the accused Hong Sang Bok for the crime of professional neglect and embezzlement.

407
00:33:56,890 --> 00:34:02,260
For the accused Do Jeong Woo, I plead life in prison

408
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,570
for the crime of professional negligence and murder.

409
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:10,330
Other than the listed above, I plead 1 year in prison for the accused Joo Ae Yeon

410
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:14,220
who helped Hong Sang Bok in handling and using the slush fund.

411
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:18,860
For the accused An Dong Chil who carried out the Myeong eong High's construction under the upper management's order,

412
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:23,600
I plead 2 years in prison according to the professional negligence law.

413
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,350
You murderers!

414
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,540
Your sentence isn't sufficient for you animals!

415
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,790
Do you wish to live after having killed such young children?

416
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:52,130
Bring back my Do Hee! Bring back our children!

417
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,210
Bring back our child!

418
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:58,430
Boo!

419
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,350
-Are you guys human? <b>-Boo!</b>

420
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:03,960
This is unfair!

421
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,110
I was just used! But I received a heavy sentence!

422
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:11,580
<i>Serves you right!</i>

423
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:19,730
♫ <i>I've got a dream that you want</i> ♫

424

♫ <i>All wrapped up nice and pretty</i> ♫

425

In the end

426
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,510
the actual sentence was weaker than the plead?

427
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:31,070
Chairman Hong's sentence is the least just.

428
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:34,630
He is the core of the collapse and the prosecution pleaded for 6 years, so

429
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,740
How could he just get 2 years?

430
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,690
But still look at how he is kicking up the storm that it's unfair.

431
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:46,030
For having blocked the evacuation announcement, he should be treated like Do Jeong Woo with the murder charge.

432
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:48,170

00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:50,360
That mosquito bastard.

500
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,480
Let's just catch one.

501
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:00,400
Look! Hong Sang Bok has been released after 3 months with a special pardon.

502
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,280
What a dirty world...

503
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:07,450
People with money would get out of [prison] in three months even if they kill the kids under the collapsing building.

504
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:09,810
Is that real? Did he really receive a special treatment and got released?

505
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:12,540
Hey! Do you think he would take you out?

506
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,610
Hey you go and make sure you do well!

507
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:17,350
I'm asking if Hong Sang Bok really received the pardon and got out?

508
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:21,370
I said so! Do you think that person would get you out?

509
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:32,020
<i>Jo Kang Ja, you made a mistake.</i>

510
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:38,550
<i>Those who touched me, none of them are safe!</i>

511
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:44,180
Hey, hey, but can we drop by a restroom somewhere?

512
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:47,040
Hey, if we stop the car we would be in trouble.

513
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,020
Who would see? There's only you and me and it would be just a while.

514
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,400
Hey, hurry.

515
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,490
Gotta poo!

516
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:10,960
This was what Do Hee liked.

517
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,150
I know.

518
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,540
So, I'm saying. I wish you would fill in Do Hee's place.

519
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:24,010
It doesn't feel right to gallivant around with just the two when we always did that with 3.

520
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:26,760
Because the basis of traipsing is 3, you see?

521
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,930
I have no interest in it though.

522
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:32,190
Hey. <b>- Selfish girl.</b>

523
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:35,500
We've been going around as three but now we're only two. Don't you find us pitiful?

524
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:39,140
How lonely are we for us to ask you.

525
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,930
It's Hong Sang Tae, right?

526
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:43,660
No. It's an unknown number.

527
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,940
You changed your phone. It's really pretty.

528
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:50,380
My mom bought it. It's my birthstone. Topaz.

529
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,610
I know, so if you go with us--

530
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:56,440
Hello. Who is this?

531
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:04,630
Yes, Teacher.

532
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:05,980
Nothing's wrong, right?

533
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,410
Of course.

534
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:11,030
Later, can you come to our house? I have something to discuss.

535
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:15,330
I'm on my way back from buying the fresh ingredient for the codfish soup as we speak.

536
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:16,930
What do you need to discuss?

537
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:21,500
Hong Sang Bok has been released under a special pardon.

538
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,310
What? How?

539
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,300
Kyung Soo's mother, Dohee's mother

540
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:31,360
all of the families agreed to gather to think of a plan.

541
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,260
Okay. See you later.

542
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:45,030
Ah Ran.

543
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:55,260
Ahjussi, how did you get here? You should not be here.

544
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,110
Of course not.

545
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:01,500
Hurry and go.

546
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,760
Why do you keep on doing things you shouldn't?

547
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,290
Turn yourself in. Hurry.

548
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,260
A little later.

549
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:18,400
Did you escape because you wanted to see me?

550
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:21,840
Am I crazy?

551
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,490
See?

552
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,860
You are my biological father.

553
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:48,420
No. You are not my daughter... my niece.

554
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,390
I...

555
00:44:56,030 --> 00:45:00,310
I killed my brother by mistake.

556
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:02,890
You are my brother's daughter.

557
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,080
Hyungnim!

558
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:50,130
Hyungnim! What happened?

559
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:00,250
You listen to your mom well.

560
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:13,260
Take her home.

561
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:17,670
Hyungnim!

562
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:57,560
Where is Hong Sang Bok? Where is Hong Sang Bok!

563
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:01,480
I... I... I will tell you.

564
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:08,450
Jo Kang Ja, I warned you, didn't I?

565
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,810
Those who touch me

566
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:16,090
not one of them are safe, didn't I warn you?

567
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:20,050
I... am a person who came back to life from hell.

568
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:28,390
If you came out, shouldn't you go and look for you son first?

569
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:34,530
You son, Hong Sang Tae, do you know how much of a hard time he had because of you?

570
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:38,020
That's why I came after you.

571
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,740
You and my son...

572
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,650
Hong Sang Bok!

573
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:33,120
Ahn Dong Chil, how did you get out?

574
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:38,120
I came the same way as you did, playing dirty tricks.

575
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:43,910
Ahn Dong Chil, your liver is quite big.

576
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:49,420
If you want to see this wench die, then go ahead.

577
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:06,050
Die! Die! Die! Die!

578
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:09,310
No! Ahn Dong Chil! Don't do this!

579
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:14,270
I told you that the law won't work with that bastard.

580
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:17,320
That bastard that's like a cockroach should be killed.

581
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:21,300
Then you would rot for the rest of your life in jail.

582
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,720
Don't you even find me despicable?

583
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,490
I know you helped Ah Ran in secret.

584
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:37,250
Because she's your brother's daughter, is that why?

585
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:44,190
Because she's your daughter.

586
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:52,140
I was wrong Jo Kang Ja.

587
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,680
I pushed to you what was mine.

588
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,310
I was sorry, Jo Kang Ja.

589
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:37,010
Ahn Dong Chil! Get up.

590
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:45,000
Save me! Get me!

591
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,290
That's what the kids felt.

592
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:55,250
You should try to feel it too, Hong Sang Bok.

593
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:03,780
Hey, get me up... quickly, get me up.

594
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:11,300
Get me up.

595
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,420
Save me.

596
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:33,110

Hey! Don't even talk about him.

616

Since I'm already here, should I buy him some food?

617
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:16,520
Never mind. He needs to have a hard time without me.

618
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:20,850
Don't be like that and let's at least buy some sweet red bean jelly for him.

644

It's for Bok Dong!

646
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:51,240
Aren't you too indifferent to Bok Dong after leaving school?

647
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:54,510
He said he missed his mom.

648
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:58,530

<i>The one that loves more is the yakja. (weak one)</i>

671
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:15,550
<i>But the world where the kangja (strong one) is the one that loves more</i>

672
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:18,850
<i>exists somewhere for sure.</i>

673
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:37,730
Noonim, you're a fool!

674
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,170
It's really cool.

675
00:56:54,590 --> 00:56:59,080
Oh Ah Ran takes after her mom as time passes by. She's strong.

676
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,950
Hey, you are too.

677
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:08,520
Anyhow, you may be stronger.

678
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,620
That's a given.

679
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:16,830
Hey, if a human were to succeed, he needs a dream and love.

680
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:18,710
You don't have both, right?

681
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:22,220
Do you have? A dream?

682
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:24,740
I will be a prosecutor one day.

683
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:27,450
There's an assignment that my dad left.

684
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:33,350
There's an account book hidden somewhere. I bet it's hidden somewhere high up.

685
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:37,560
That... I will take that and change this world.

686
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:46,880
I don't know about love... but I have a dream too.

687
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:59,090
Now it truly is spring.

688
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:02,480
When was it when we were cold and hurt

689
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:08,130
in our school, spring would also come, right?

690
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:12,720
If there is spring then there would be winter too.

691
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:17,140
In the world every spring has a winter.

692
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:23,700
There is a saying, "For every winter there is a spring."

693
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:27,750
What you said is right.

694
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:33,090
If the roots are strong, even if a harsh winter comes,

695
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:36,020
there will be spring flowers for sure.

696
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:41,810
Because you are there, that's why I was able to withstand it.

697
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:45,280
Because there were moms that's why it was possible.

698
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:51,310
And also... dads too.

699
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:58,260
<i>It was a really long and harsh winter.</i>

700
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:03,570
<i>I think often about the seeds that are forever asleep in the cold and dark</i>

701
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:07,580
<i>and couldn't see the spring.</i>

702
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:12,650
<i>in order for the frozen ground to melt, I wish there would be a warm rain.</i>

703
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:15,890
<i>So that all those seeds that are buried would rise.</i>

704
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:24,830
<i>I wish there would be more strong ones in the world.</i>

705
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:28,260
<i>A world where more people who are loved would win</i>

706
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:31,550
<i>I wish that world would come soon.</i>

707
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:34,270
<i> Okay!</i>

708
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:38,860
Okay!
