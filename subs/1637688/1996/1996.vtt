00:01:10,682 --> 00:01:13,480
<i>I married Mickey Holler
when I was 15.</i>

2
00:01:13,585 --> 00:01:18,181
<i>He was 20 years old, Mickey...
real name, Mervin.</i>

3
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,075
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

4
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,643
Are you happy, baby?

5
00:01:21,693 --> 00:01:23,783
Oh, sure I am, Mickey.

6
00:01:25,664 --> 00:01:27,996
Welcome to the family, pumpkin.

7
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,294
Mm.

8
00:01:29,468 --> 00:01:31,333
It sure is gonna be nice
having you around

9
00:01:31,436 --> 00:01:32,869
with my knuckleheaded
nephew here.

10
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:34,199
- You did good, bub.
- Yeah.

11
00:01:34,306 --> 00:01:36,365
If your mama were alive today,
she'd be proud of you, too.

12
00:01:36,475 --> 00:01:38,067
Congratulations.

13
00:01:38,176 --> 00:01:40,696
I sincerely hope it works out
for the both of y'all.

14
00:01:40,746 --> 00:01:41,696
Thank you!

15
00:01:43,615 --> 00:01:45,515
Yeah!

16
00:01:45,617 --> 00:01:47,710
Hold on. Don't fall, baby.

17
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:49,309
Get on my back.

18
00:01:49,421 --> 00:01:51,514
<i>I came from a series
of foster homes,</i>

19
00:01:51,623 --> 00:01:54,023
<i>where my so-called "daddies"
would end up fooling with me.</i>

20
00:01:54,126 --> 00:01:55,171
Here we go!

21
00:01:55,761 --> 00:01:58,821
<i>My foster moms would beat me
for no reason...</i>

22
00:01:58,931 --> 00:02:01,297
<i>and every reason...</i>

23
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,392
<i>so I married Mickey.</i>

24
00:02:04,503 --> 00:02:06,903
I'll see you later, Uncle Phil.

25
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:09,303
Thanks, Aunt Kay.

26
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:11,901
Bye.

27
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,911
<i>Mickey seemed like
a dream come true.</i>

28
00:02:15,013 --> 00:02:17,277
<i>All I ever had to do
was say what I wanted,</i>

29
00:02:17,382 --> 00:02:18,567
<i>like go to a movie</i>

30
00:02:18,617 --> 00:02:21,381
<i>or get a grilled-cheese sandwich
with a chocolate shake,</i>

31
00:02:21,486 --> 00:02:25,856
<i>and it became
his whole purpose in life.</i>

32
00:02:26,258 --> 00:02:28,749
Uncle Phil's gonna give me
some more routes soon.

33
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,023
I was thinking that, you know,
when you finish school

34
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,791
and we save up some money,
in a few years,

35
00:02:33,899 --> 00:02:36,285
we should start to think
about getting a place of our own.

36
00:02:36,335 --> 00:02:37,393
In a few years?

37
00:02:37,502 --> 00:02:38,491
Well, yeah.

38
00:02:38,603 --> 00:02:40,468
I mean, Uncle Phil and Aunt Kay
don't mind.

39
00:02:40,572 --> 00:02:42,233
I mean, you are family now.

40
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:43,865
Well, I know.

41
00:02:43,976 --> 00:02:45,273
It was just...

42
00:02:45,377 --> 00:02:47,311
I was kind of hoping
we could get our own place,

43
00:02:47,412 --> 00:02:49,131
like, in a few months.

44
00:02:49,181 --> 00:02:51,615
Well, hey, my baby
wants a place of her own,

45
00:02:51,717 --> 00:02:54,151
my baby's gonna get
a place of her own...

46
00:02:54,252 --> 00:02:55,637
in a few months.

47
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:57,120
Really, Mickey?

48
00:02:57,222 --> 00:02:58,553
Yes, Ma'am!

49
00:02:58,724 --> 00:03:00,842
You don't gotta worry
about nothin' no more.

50
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:04,787
<i>He loved me...
and that was a plus.</i>

51
00:03:05,197 --> 00:03:09,282
<i>Even if he didn't know
much about it.</i>

52
00:03:13,071 --> 00:03:15,301
<i># I was a wild-eyed, skirt-chasin'#</i>

53
00:03:15,407 --> 00:03:18,637
<i># Love-takin' troublemaker#</i>

54
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:25,021
<i># Built Ford tough,
every square inch a hell-raiser#</i>

55
00:03:25,784 --> 00:03:28,218
<i># The bar-room king of this town#</i>

56
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,410
<i># And then... #</i>

57
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:42,263
<i># Baby, babe#</i>

58
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:44,460
Hey, hey, everybody!

59
00:03:44,636 --> 00:03:47,036
<i># Here comes the bride#</i>

60
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:49,858
<i># All dressed in white#</i>

61
00:03:49,908 --> 00:03:50,738
Mm.

62
00:03:50,842 --> 00:03:53,562
Ain't she just the prettiest thing
you ever seen?

63
00:03:53,612 --> 00:03:55,546
My, my.

64
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,835
Mickey Holler, I think you've got
horseshoes up your ass.

65
00:03:59,885 --> 00:04:01,352
That's for sure.

66
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:03,921
I'm the luckiest guy alive.

67
00:04:04,089 --> 00:04:04,919
I'll say.

68
00:04:05,023 --> 00:04:06,285
Excuse us.

69
00:04:06,391 --> 00:04:07,809
Mick, I hate to break this to you,

70
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:09,190
knowing it's your weddin' day
and all,

71
00:04:09,294 --> 00:04:10,761
but we're a little shorthanded
tomorrow.

72
00:04:10,862 --> 00:04:12,625
I'm gonna have to have you
fill in for Leroy.

73
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:14,130
- What?
- Yeah. His mama died.

74
00:04:14,232 --> 00:04:15,884
Tomorrow?! Well, shit!

75
00:04:15,934 --> 00:04:18,027
Hey, you're a married man now.
You have a wife to support.

76
00:04:18,136 --> 00:04:19,899
I know, but, Uncle Phil, come on!

77
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:21,802
- Are you a man?
- I...

78
00:04:21,907 --> 00:04:25,227
Mick, are you a man,
or are you a mouse?

79
00:04:25,277 --> 00:04:27,370
I... uh...

80
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:28,379
Mick.

81
00:04:28,447 --> 00:04:29,539
Philip!

82
00:04:29,714 --> 00:04:31,079
Yes, dear?

83
00:04:31,249 --> 00:04:33,702
Burgers... they're on fire.

84
00:04:33,752 --> 00:04:36,016
Oh, shit.

85
00:04:39,091 --> 00:04:40,854
Well...

86
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:43,086
This will be your new home...

87
00:04:43,195 --> 00:04:44,958
for now.

88
00:04:45,063 --> 00:04:45,688
Mm.

89
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:47,594
There's spare sheets and blankets
in the closet.

90
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,599
Towels are in the bathroom
under the sink.

91
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:51,316
Thank you, Ma'am.

92
00:04:51,803 --> 00:04:53,255
Do you know how to cook?

93
00:04:53,305 --> 00:04:55,637
Oh, of course, Aunt Kay.

94
00:04:59,678 --> 00:05:02,010
I'm not your aunt, Jolene.

95
00:05:02,114 --> 00:05:05,344
Please, call me by my name... Kay.

96
00:05:05,884 --> 00:05:08,478
Of course, Kay.

97
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,090
Mickey, I don't think
your aunt likes me.

98
00:05:14,192 --> 00:05:16,126
Hey! How can you say that?

99
00:05:16,228 --> 00:05:18,613
Uncle Phil and Aunt Kay,
they think you're real special.

100
00:05:18,663 --> 00:05:21,988
And you're my wife, for chrissakes!

101
00:05:35,347 --> 00:05:36,678
Hold on!

102
00:05:36,781 --> 00:05:40,011
Give your husband a kiss good-bye.

103
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:44,940
Now go learn something for me...

104
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,252
...and teach it to me later.

105
00:05:46,358 --> 00:05:48,121
Okay.

106
00:05:58,637 --> 00:06:01,265
So, what do you think?

107
00:06:01,373 --> 00:06:03,637
I don't like it.

108
00:06:03,742 --> 00:06:05,260
It doesn't seem real.

109
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,130
Then try drawing
what you've seen or experienced.

110
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,298
Most of the things I've seen,
I'd never want to draw.

111
00:06:10,348 --> 00:06:12,153
Then draw the rest.

112
00:06:14,352 --> 00:06:15,683
Okay. I'll try.

113
00:06:16,788 --> 00:06:19,068
You have talent, Jolene.

114
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,926
It'll come to you, if you let it.

115
00:06:32,804 --> 00:06:34,422
Great meal, Jolene.

116
00:06:34,472 --> 00:06:35,700
Yes sirree.

117
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:38,360
Ain't she a peach?

118
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,695
What is that special sauce on top?

119
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:45,020
Well, whatever it is,
it sure is gourmet-like.

120
00:06:46,351 --> 00:06:48,012
Where did you learn how to cook?

121
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:49,848
I taught myself.

122
00:06:50,021 --> 00:06:54,809
Well, you don't need to learn
anything more about meatloaf, sugar.

123
00:06:54,859 --> 00:06:56,378
It's gourmet-like.

124
00:06:56,428 --> 00:06:59,047
Thanks, but I got to save
some room for dessert.

125
00:06:59,097 --> 00:07:01,691
Oh. I'm sorry.

126
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,518
I- I didn't make any dessert.

127
00:07:03,568 --> 00:07:04,933
That meatloaf was so sweet-tasting,

128
00:07:05,036 --> 00:07:08,123
<i>it was like having dessert
and dinner all rolled into one.</i>

129
00:07:08,173 --> 00:07:10,141
Maybe you could think
about making a-a salad

130
00:07:10,242 --> 00:07:11,470
or a vegetable next time.

131
00:07:11,576 --> 00:07:13,328
Well, if you're still hungry,
Aunt Kay,

132
00:07:13,378 --> 00:07:15,163
we can run out
and get you some ice cream.

133
00:07:15,213 --> 00:07:17,465
No, thank you, Mickey.
I'm full.

134
00:07:17,515 --> 00:07:20,313
Anyway, don't forget
to clean up, okay?

135
00:07:20,418 --> 00:07:24,272
Oh. If you want, Kay,
I can make you a sandwich.

136
00:07:24,322 --> 00:07:25,414
Oh, my.

137
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:33,061
Maybe she should do
her own damn cooking.

138
00:07:33,265 --> 00:07:34,960
It wasn't that bad, was it?

139
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:38,661
Oh, God, no, baby.
It was great.

140
00:07:40,672 --> 00:07:43,106
You almost done with that?

141
00:07:45,143 --> 00:07:47,168
Yeah.

142
00:07:49,214 --> 00:07:51,079
I'm tired.

143
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:54,078
Good.

144
00:07:54,185 --> 00:07:56,465
I got somethin' for you.

145
00:07:57,656 --> 00:07:59,366
Go ahead. Open it.

146
00:07:59,758 --> 00:08:01,743
My birthday isn't till tomorrow.

147
00:08:01,793 --> 00:08:05,118
I know, but... this is for tonight.

148
00:08:07,098 --> 00:08:09,532
Gee...

149
00:08:09,634 --> 00:08:11,966
Mickey, it's so nice!

150
00:08:12,137 --> 00:08:13,900
I picked it out myself.

151
00:08:14,005 --> 00:08:16,570
Aren't you gonna try it on?

152
00:08:18,476 --> 00:08:21,104
The ladies at the store were
asking me all sorts of questions

153
00:08:21,212 --> 00:08:22,873
about your sizes and everything.

154
00:08:22,981 --> 00:08:26,401
And I just hope that I got it right.

155
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:29,182
I got it from Berman's
if you want to return it.

156
00:08:29,287 --> 00:08:31,312
No, I like it!

157
00:08:36,928 --> 00:08:38,987
Thanks, Mickey.

158
00:08:40,065 --> 00:08:41,583
I'm sure I'll grow into it.

159
00:08:41,633 --> 00:08:44,397
You look good, baby.

160
00:08:44,502 --> 00:08:46,732
Real sexy.

161
00:08:47,472 --> 00:08:48,461
Come here.

162
00:08:50,642 --> 00:08:52,371
Oh.

163
00:08:53,345 --> 00:08:56,405
I wish my ma could have met you.

164
00:08:56,514 --> 00:08:59,839
She'd love you just the same as me.

165
00:09:01,753 --> 00:09:03,220
Mick?

166
00:09:03,321 --> 00:09:05,346
Yeah?

167
00:09:07,592 --> 00:09:09,253
How'd she die?

168
00:09:20,138 --> 00:09:24,033
I don't want to talk about that
right now.

169
00:09:24,609 --> 00:09:27,203
But I'm your wife.

170
00:09:27,846 --> 00:09:31,179
We ought to be able
to share everything.

171
00:09:31,282 --> 00:09:33,182
I know. We ought to.

172
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:37,464
I just don't want to talk
about it right now.

173
00:09:39,591 --> 00:09:41,684
Okay.

174
00:09:53,571 --> 00:09:56,041
What's the matter, Mickey?

175
00:09:56,274 --> 00:09:59,641
I'm just so lucky I found you.

176
00:10:05,617 --> 00:10:08,347
Happy birthday.

177
00:10:08,453 --> 00:10:10,978
I'm sorry.

178
00:10:17,028 --> 00:10:19,997
I love my present, Mickey.

179
00:10:20,098 --> 00:10:21,030
Thank you.

180
00:10:25,904 --> 00:10:26,893
Jolene?

181
00:10:27,005 --> 00:10:28,438
Shh.

182
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,531
Here.

183
00:10:40,718 --> 00:10:43,188
<i>He had no ambition.</i>

184
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:49,083
<i>He no longer talked about
getting a little place of our own</i>

185
00:10:49,194 --> 00:10:50,525
<i>or moving toward anything</i>

186
00:10:50,628 --> 00:10:56,898
<i>that would make things different
for us than they were then.</i>

187
00:10:57,869 --> 00:11:01,032
<i>He was a day-to-day person.</i>

188
00:11:10,315 --> 00:11:12,180
Wakey, wakey!

189
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:17,310
<i># Tonight's the night
I've been waiting for#</i>

190
00:11:17,422 --> 00:11:20,914
<i># Because you're not a baby#</i>

191
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:22,754
<i># Anymore#</i>

192
00:11:22,927 --> 00:11:28,490
<i># You've turned into
the prettiest girl I've ever seen#</i>

193
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:31,991
<i># Happy birthday, sweet 16%%</i>

194
00:11:33,771 --> 00:11:37,381
<i># Happy birthday, sweet Jolene#</i>

195
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,810
Mm.

196
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,432
Get your skinny ass out of bed, boy!

197
00:11:44,482 --> 00:11:46,473
"Boy"? Don't be callin' me that,
old man!

198
00:11:46,584 --> 00:11:47,710
Hey, hey, hey.

199
00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:49,938
Why do you gotta get
all sensitive about it?

200
00:11:49,988 --> 00:11:52,240
I don't want you callin' me that
in front of my wife.

201
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,814
Huh? What?

202
00:11:56,794 --> 00:11:59,126
I hate to break up
the happy little party here,

203
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,926
but, um, the kitchen floor
is an absolute mess,

204
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:05,153
and, well, being as you cooked
last night, Jolene,

205
00:12:05,203 --> 00:12:07,330
do you think you could possibly
manage to clean it up?

206
00:12:07,438 --> 00:12:09,770
Sure, Kay.
I ain't got nothin' better to do.

207
00:12:09,874 --> 00:12:13,294
Oh, and, by the way, happy birthday.

208
00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:18,700
<i>Uncle Phil was always
tryin' to show off around me,</i>

209
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,803
<i>and he gave me great big hugs...</i>

210
00:12:21,853 --> 00:12:24,893
<i>that lasted way too long.</i>

211
00:12:56,321 --> 00:12:58,619
<i># Oh, everybody#</i>

212
00:12:58,723 --> 00:13:00,714
<i># Get on the floor#</i>

213
00:13:00,825 --> 00:13:03,055
<i># Let's dance#</i>

214
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,456
<i># Don't fight your feelings#</i>

215
00:13:08,566 --> 00:13:11,606
<i># Give yourself a chance#</i>

216
00:13:13,638 --> 00:13:16,090
<i># Shake, shake, shake#</i>

217
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,392
<i># Shake, shake, shake#</i>

218
00:13:17,442 --> 00:13:19,727
<i># Shake your booty#</i>

219
00:13:19,777 --> 00:13:21,745
<i># Shake your booty#</i>

220
00:13:21,846 --> 00:13:24,699
<i># Oh, shake, shake, shake#</i>

221
00:13:24,749 --> 00:13:26,216
<i># Shake, shake, shake#</i>

222
00:13:26,317 --> 00:13:28,536
<i># Shake your booty#</i>

223
00:13:28,586 --> 00:13:30,171
<i># Shake your booty#</i>

224
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:32,587
<i># Oh, you can#</i>

225
00:13:32,757 --> 00:13:34,942
<i># You can do it#</i>

226
00:13:35,026 --> 00:13:36,831
<i># Very well#</i>

227
00:13:39,864 --> 00:13:43,425
<i># You're the best in the world#</i>

228
00:13:43,534 --> 00:13:45,434
<i># I can tell#</i>

229
00:13:47,705 --> 00:13:50,325
<i># Oh, shake, shake, shake#</i>

230
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,160
<i># Shake, shake, shake#</i>

231
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,871
<i># Shake your booty#</i>

232
00:13:53,978 --> 00:13:56,173
Happy birthday, pumpkin.

233
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,367
<i># Oh, shake, shake, shake#</i>

234
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:00,679
<i># Shake, shake, shake#</i>

235
00:14:00,785 --> 00:14:02,912
<i># Shake your booty#</i>

236
00:14:03,021 --> 00:14:04,784
<i># Shake your booty#</i>

237
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:07,380
<i># Oh, oh, yeah#</i>

238
00:14:09,794 --> 00:14:12,058
<i># Shake, shake#</i>

239
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:19,603
<i>In my whole life,</i>

240
00:14:19,704 --> 00:14:25,499
<i>I'd never been to where
I couldn't wait to see someone.</i>

241
00:14:34,085 --> 00:14:38,044
<i>I tried to contain myself,
but I couldn't.</i>

242
00:14:38,156 --> 00:14:39,316
<i>I don't know.</i>

243
00:14:39,424 --> 00:14:43,034
<i>It was just that way with Phil.</i>

244
00:14:57,175 --> 00:14:59,905
<i>It was so intense and constant,</i>

245
00:15:00,011 --> 00:15:03,572
<i>so ever-present and undeniable</i>

246
00:15:03,748 --> 00:15:07,548
<i>that Phil was no longer laughing.</i>

247
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,845
<i>It was every day now,</i>

248
00:16:08,946 --> 00:16:12,347
<i>and always between the hours
of when Aunt Kay left for the bank</i>

249
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:15,544
<i>and when Mickey
would drive her home.</i>

250
00:16:15,653 --> 00:16:17,814
<i>Poor Mickey.</i>

251
00:16:19,423 --> 00:16:22,881
<i>I just felt so sorry for him.</i>

252
00:16:22,994 --> 00:16:27,454
I could keel over right now
and be perfectly fine with that.

253
00:16:27,565 --> 00:16:30,864
Hey, I wouldn't be fine with that.

254
00:17:03,835 --> 00:17:10,105
I think this must be one of the most
beautiful places in the world.

255
00:17:10,441 --> 00:17:13,137
See that ridge over there?

256
00:17:13,744 --> 00:17:17,398
We could build a house up there.
Just you and me, pumpkin.

257
00:17:17,448 --> 00:17:19,734
Look out over the valley every day,

258
00:17:19,784 --> 00:17:21,411
and as long as you were there,

259
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:26,808
<i>it would be the most beautiful place
in the world.</i>

260
00:17:26,858 --> 00:17:29,993
Kiss me, baby.
Let's make it real.

261
00:17:38,536 --> 00:17:40,003
Stop it, Phil.

262
00:17:42,273 --> 00:17:43,865
It hurts too bad.

263
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,751
What hurts, angel?

264
00:17:46,544 --> 00:17:48,307
Look at me.

265
00:17:49,313 --> 00:17:50,371
I'm looking.

266
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,680
Can't you understand
I'll wait for you, Phil?

267
00:17:55,786 --> 00:17:58,516
However long it takes.
Even till after Kay dies.

268
00:17:58,623 --> 00:18:00,474
That's how much I care.

269
00:18:00,524 --> 00:18:03,652
I love every little inch of you,
Jolene,

270
00:18:03,761 --> 00:18:07,720
and I'm not gonna give you up
for anything or anyone.

271
00:18:07,832 --> 00:18:11,442
But we got to be sensitive
and careful.

272
00:18:15,573 --> 00:18:18,025
I can be sensitive and careful.

273
00:18:18,075 --> 00:18:21,495
We got to think
about Mickey and Kay.

274
00:18:25,383 --> 00:18:29,753
We don't got to think
about anything right now.

275
00:18:44,702 --> 00:18:45,828
Do you hear something?

276
00:18:45,937 --> 00:18:48,428
It's probably just the TV.

277
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,032
No, I hear something.

278
00:18:52,143 --> 00:18:54,668
<i>It's something
that's very, very important.</i>

279
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:59,216
<i>We have, back again,
a blood-pressure monitor!</i>

280
00:18:59,317 --> 00:19:01,597
<i>Okay, here it is.</i>

281
00:19:06,357 --> 00:19:08,732
<i>Information not...</i>

282
00:19:10,561 --> 00:19:12,927
Oh! Kay!

283
00:19:13,564 --> 00:19:16,089
You little whore!

284
00:19:16,267 --> 00:19:18,758
You little bitch! Damn you!

285
00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:27,500
You heinous little bitch!

286
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:30,543
The next time you want
to ruin someone's life,

287
00:19:30,648 --> 00:19:32,616
make it your own!

288
00:19:32,783 --> 00:19:34,808
Aah!

289
00:19:37,254 --> 00:19:38,312
Aah!

290
00:19:50,935 --> 00:19:52,630
How could you hurt Mickey?!

291
00:19:52,737 --> 00:19:54,967
No, no, no.
Hey! Hey! Put that down!

292
00:19:55,072 --> 00:19:56,699
Put that down!

293
00:20:01,245 --> 00:20:03,509
Mickey, I'm so sorry.

294
00:20:05,449 --> 00:20:08,543
No, Mickey, please.

295
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:09,583
Mickey!

296
00:20:09,687 --> 00:20:11,772
I didn't mean to hurt you!

297
00:20:11,822 --> 00:20:14,017
Mickey, no!

298
00:20:20,965 --> 00:20:23,433
Well, it's your damn fault!

299
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,768
Mickey!

300
00:21:14,085 --> 00:21:15,643
Ohh!

301
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:28,385
<i>When they told me
about Mickey, I cried for days.</i>

302
00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:34,121
I'm gonna give you a mild sedative
so you can sleep tonight.

303
00:21:34,171 --> 00:21:37,686
You're just gonna feel
a little pinch.

304
00:21:37,842 --> 00:21:39,275
Aah.

305
00:21:39,443 --> 00:21:41,638
Now, why don't you go ahead
and lie back on down?

306
00:21:41,745 --> 00:21:43,713
Come on.

307
00:21:47,518 --> 00:21:50,248
Protective services want to see you
in the morning.

308
00:21:50,354 --> 00:21:52,339
They want to talk to you
about what happened.

309
00:21:52,389 --> 00:21:54,289
But it was an accident.
I told you.

310
00:21:54,391 --> 00:21:55,824
I know, honey.

311
00:21:55,993 --> 00:21:58,120
Try to get some sleep.

312
00:22:01,832 --> 00:22:04,027
<i>They put me in a motel
by the interstate</i>

313
00:22:04,135 --> 00:22:07,555
<i>until they could figure out
what to do with me.</i>

314
00:22:07,605 --> 00:22:09,766
<i>They called me a home-wrecker,</i>

315
00:22:09,874 --> 00:22:11,865
<i>but also a widow,</i>

316
00:22:11,976 --> 00:22:16,709
<i>but also a juvenile delinquent
with no living relatives.</i>

317
00:22:16,814 --> 00:22:21,001
<i>I guess everything they said
about me was true.</i>

318
00:22:21,051 --> 00:22:24,646
<i>They sent a psychiatrist that worked
for the county to interview me.</i>

319
00:22:24,755 --> 00:22:27,241
Tell me your feelings about Mickey.

320
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:30,192
He loved me.

321
00:22:31,028 --> 00:22:33,213
Nobody ever did before.

322
00:22:34,832 --> 00:22:36,732
Did you love Mickey?

323
00:22:37,401 --> 00:22:38,959
I miss him.

324
00:22:40,638 --> 00:22:42,348
<i>And Philip?</i>

325
00:22:46,277 --> 00:22:49,144
<i>It was the double cross of all time.</i>

326
00:22:49,246 --> 00:22:52,147
<i>He recommended I be sent
to the juvenile loony bin</i>

327
00:22:52,249 --> 00:22:56,083
<i>until such time I was to become
a reasonable adult.</i>

328
00:22:56,187 --> 00:23:00,055
<i>I had told my story in all honesty,</i>

329
00:23:00,157 --> 00:23:03,711
<i>and for that I was sent away...</i>

330
00:23:03,761 --> 00:23:06,801
<i>...to be punished for it.</i>

331
00:23:06,864 --> 00:23:08,058
My name is Mrs. Ames,

332
00:23:08,165 --> 00:23:10,463
and I'm the head nurse here
at South Sumter.

333
00:23:10,568 --> 00:23:12,661
And this is Cindy.
She's your attendant.

334
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,032
She'll be looking after you,

335
00:23:14,138 --> 00:23:16,490
along with all the other girls
in your ward.

336
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,526
I'm here every day except Friday.

337
00:23:18,576 --> 00:23:21,996
Follow the rules,
and we will get along just great.

338
00:23:22,046 --> 00:23:24,431
Do you have any questions for us?

339
00:23:24,481 --> 00:23:27,575
C- could I have some paper
and some colored pencils

340
00:23:27,685 --> 00:23:28,502
to draw with?

341
00:23:28,552 --> 00:23:32,352
Unfortunately, pens and pencils
are not allowed in our facility.

342
00:23:32,456 --> 00:23:34,583
But maybe we can get you
some Crayolas.

343
00:23:34,692 --> 00:23:35,920
Would that do?

344
00:23:36,026 --> 00:23:37,687
Yes, Ma'am.

345
00:23:38,229 --> 00:23:39,647
Do you have anything to add?

346
00:23:39,697 --> 00:23:41,122
Just the pills.

347
00:23:41,398 --> 00:23:42,922
Here you go.

348
00:23:43,901 --> 00:23:45,801
Take these.

349
00:23:46,704 --> 00:23:47,988
But I'm not sick.

350
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:51,058
Don't worry.
Everybody here takes 'em.

351
00:23:51,108 --> 00:23:52,575
Come on.

352
00:24:02,853 --> 00:24:03,877
Good girl.

353
00:24:24,575 --> 00:24:27,100
<i>After a few days,</i>

354
00:24:27,211 --> 00:24:31,978
<i>I learned that this was no place
to get back your wits,</i>

355
00:24:32,082 --> 00:24:37,117
<i>even if you never lost them
in the first place.</i>

356
00:24:48,832 --> 00:24:50,163
Your Honor...

357
00:24:50,267 --> 00:24:51,393
<i>About two months later,</i>

358
00:24:51,502 --> 00:24:54,494
<i>I was called upon to prove
to the judge I was 16...</i>

359
00:24:54,605 --> 00:24:55,970
However, we do reserve the right...

360
00:24:56,073 --> 00:24:58,507
<i>...which made Phil
a statutory rapist.</i>

361
00:24:58,609 --> 00:25:00,372
Thank you.

362
00:25:00,477 --> 00:25:04,846
Very well.
The witness is excused.

363
00:25:11,588 --> 00:25:13,298
<i>At first...</i>

364
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:16,988
<i>...I didn't know
what was different about him</i>

365
00:25:17,094 --> 00:25:21,464
<i>until I realized
that his hair was gray.</i>

366
00:25:22,266 --> 00:25:24,530
Phil.

367
00:25:24,702 --> 00:25:29,167
<i>He must have been dying it
all this time.</i>

368
00:25:49,893 --> 00:25:52,054
Hey, Red.

369
00:25:53,564 --> 00:25:54,895
Here.

370
00:25:58,836 --> 00:26:01,737
I can't imagine you mixed up
with that creep.

371
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:05,138
He ought to be taken out
and hung up by his balls.

372
00:26:05,242 --> 00:26:07,335
Fuckin' child molester.

373
00:26:07,945 --> 00:26:09,845
No, it was my fault.

374
00:26:10,881 --> 00:26:14,214
Now, that's a load of crap.

375
00:26:14,318 --> 00:26:18,213
You know, in my opinion,
all men are pigs.

376
00:26:21,925 --> 00:26:23,722
Hey.

377
00:26:23,894 --> 00:26:25,725
Practice with these.

378
00:26:25,829 --> 00:26:27,539
Come on, take 'em.

379
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:33,992
Now, just don't tell the doc, okay?

380
00:26:36,473 --> 00:26:37,838
Now, Red,

381
00:26:37,941 --> 00:26:41,028
don't let anything they said
about you back there bother you.

382
00:26:41,078 --> 00:26:42,841
Okay?

383
00:26:42,946 --> 00:26:47,067
You're just a pretty girl
that got taken advantage of.

384
00:26:47,117 --> 00:26:49,036
I don't belong here, Cindy.

385
00:26:49,086 --> 00:26:50,781
Oh, I know you don't,

386
00:26:50,888 --> 00:26:54,213
but it's just how the system works.

387
00:26:55,426 --> 00:26:56,984
It's killing me.

388
00:26:58,695 --> 00:27:01,721
Well, you just do your time,
and before you know it,

389
00:27:01,832 --> 00:27:03,527
you'll be starting all over again.

390
00:27:03,634 --> 00:27:06,484
Come on. Let's get you to bed.

391
00:27:25,789 --> 00:27:28,758
Kill the lights in five minutes.

392
00:27:35,132 --> 00:27:37,050
<i>I heard that Phil
got sentenced</i>

393
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,627
<i>to 18 months in state prison.</i>

394
00:27:40,737 --> 00:27:46,266
<i>I really couldn't care less,
being in one of my own.</i>

395
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,057
Fuck! Aah!

396
00:28:21,445 --> 00:28:22,345
Hey!

397
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,738
We got a bleeder!

398
00:28:24,848 --> 00:28:27,476
No! Let me die!

399
00:28:27,584 --> 00:28:29,176
Let me die!

400
00:28:29,353 --> 00:28:31,287
Let me die!

401
00:28:31,455 --> 00:28:32,786
Let me die!

402
00:28:32,956 --> 00:28:35,576
We got a bleeder here!
We got a bleeder!

403
00:28:35,626 --> 00:28:37,218
Let me die!

404
00:28:37,327 --> 00:28:39,158
Let me die!

405
00:28:39,263 --> 00:28:42,208
Let me die!
Let me die! Damn it!

406
00:29:07,991 --> 00:29:10,050
Hey. Pill time!

407
00:29:18,602 --> 00:29:20,521
I'm gonna take a break.
You want to go for a smoke?

408
00:29:20,571 --> 00:29:22,189
Won't I get in trouble?

409
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:24,804
<i>Hey, you're with me.</i>

410
00:29:24,975 --> 00:29:26,305
Oh, of course.

411
00:29:28,445 --> 00:29:30,174
Hey, Red.

412
00:29:31,114 --> 00:29:32,919
Geez, this is good!

413
00:29:33,517 --> 00:29:36,748
I wish I had me some watercolors.

414
00:29:38,355 --> 00:29:39,413
Let's go.

415
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,615
Just a sec.

416
00:29:48,699 --> 00:29:51,190
Isn't it amazing
how you can still find beauty

417
00:29:51,301 --> 00:29:52,819
no matter where you are?

418
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:54,666
Mm.

419
00:29:55,539 --> 00:29:56,904
I don't know if I ever told you,

420
00:29:57,007 --> 00:30:00,841
but I'm pretty good
with hair and make-up.

421
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:04,498
I've even been called
an artist before.

422
00:30:04,548 --> 00:30:07,968
I mean, not in the same way
as you, but...

423
00:30:08,018 --> 00:30:10,203
I bet I could make you
look real pretty.

424
00:30:10,253 --> 00:30:13,240
I mean, prettier
than you already are.

425
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:17,377
Now, what I would never do
is cover up those freckles.

426
00:30:17,427 --> 00:30:20,714
They give your skin
little dots of sunlight.

427
00:30:20,764 --> 00:30:25,894
You know, some people call them
little kisses from God.

428
00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:28,262
But, you know, if you keep pulling
your hair back in a ponytail,

429
00:30:28,372 --> 00:30:29,389
it's gonna recede.

430
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:31,202
You might go bald.

431
00:30:31,308 --> 00:30:35,540
But what I would do
is cut it a little shorter

432
00:30:35,646 --> 00:30:38,274
so it'll frame your face just right,

433
00:30:38,382 --> 00:30:43,322
and you'll be just as pretty
as one of your pictures.

434
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,583
Sorry.

435
00:31:31,835 --> 00:31:35,862
<i>It wasn't too bad
being loved by a woman.</i>

436
00:31:35,972 --> 00:31:36,961
<i>Once you get going,</i>

437
00:31:37,074 --> 00:31:40,942
<i>it doesn't matter who it is
and what they've got.</i>

438
00:31:41,044 --> 00:31:45,538
<i>All you have to do
is close your eyes.</i>

439
00:31:56,059 --> 00:31:58,755
I think you might need these.

440
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:03,732
Thank you, Ms. Ames.

441
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,267
You have Cindy to thank.
She told me about your drawings.

442
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,890
It's good therapy.
Keep it up.

443
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:13,360
Nice to have an artist in residence.

444
00:32:19,783 --> 00:32:24,058
I'll pay you a dollar
if you paint my picture.

445
00:32:24,554 --> 00:32:28,115
<i>If they didn't have a mirror,
they had me.</i>

446
00:32:28,225 --> 00:32:30,921
<i>Some of the likenesses
weren't very good,</i>

447
00:32:31,027 --> 00:32:34,724
<i>but since in most cases
they were better than the originals,</i>

448
00:32:34,831 --> 00:32:37,800
<i>nobody much minded.</i>

449
00:32:44,374 --> 00:32:45,274
Shh!

450
00:32:46,343 --> 00:32:48,368
Shh!

451
00:32:50,413 --> 00:32:51,402
Aah.

452
00:32:51,515 --> 00:32:53,142
Shh!

453
00:32:56,953 --> 00:33:00,081
I'm gonna lose my job
if you keep this up.

454
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,020
Shh!

455
00:33:01,124 --> 00:33:01,886
Ohh.

456
00:33:01,992 --> 00:33:02,981
Mm.

457
00:33:05,128 --> 00:33:07,892
Oh, I want it to be like this
all the time, don't you?

458
00:33:07,998 --> 00:33:09,829
Mm.

459
00:33:09,933 --> 00:33:12,993
You're damn straight I do.

460
00:33:15,105 --> 00:33:18,050
Then get me out of here, Cindy.

461
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:26,672
You know, I've been thinkin'...

462
00:33:26,783 --> 00:33:29,980
I might have a plan.

463
00:33:31,488 --> 00:33:34,355
But you just have to
promise me something.

464
00:33:34,457 --> 00:33:37,949
You gotta live with me
and stay with me forever...

465
00:33:38,061 --> 00:33:40,529
don't ever leave... never ever.

466
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:41,580
I mean it.

467
00:33:44,367 --> 00:33:46,586
<i>I'll never leave you, Cindy.</i>

468
00:33:46,636 --> 00:33:47,933
You promise?

469
00:33:49,072 --> 00:33:51,336
I swear.

470
00:33:52,108 --> 00:33:53,166
Oh, shit.

471
00:35:07,951 --> 00:35:09,077
Good night, Dan.

472
00:35:09,185 --> 00:35:11,016
Good night, Cindy.

473
00:35:21,665 --> 00:35:23,690
Goddamn it, Red.

474
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,428
You look beautiful.

475
00:35:28,004 --> 00:35:30,131
Wow!

476
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,901
I look like somebody else.

477
00:35:32,008 --> 00:35:34,135
<i>You are somebody else, baby.</i>

478
00:35:34,244 --> 00:35:38,519
You're my woman now.
Don't you ever forget it.

479
00:35:41,651 --> 00:35:44,415
Oh, shit, I gotta go!

480
00:35:44,788 --> 00:35:47,018
Oh, they're gonna know
you're missing by now.

481
00:35:47,123 --> 00:35:49,242
They're gonna be asking
so many questions.

482
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:51,678
Well, what time do you think
you'll be back?

483
00:35:51,728 --> 00:35:53,719
Soon, honey, soon.

484
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,229
I got the next two days off.

485
00:35:55,332 --> 00:35:57,391
We'll spend it in bed!

486
00:35:57,567 --> 00:35:59,452
Can we go to the beach? Please?

487
00:35:59,502 --> 00:36:00,935
No!

488
00:36:01,037 --> 00:36:03,130
We gotta lay low
till this whole thing blows over.

489
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:04,474
Jesus Christ.

490
00:36:06,242 --> 00:36:08,039
I don't want you
looking out that window.

491
00:36:08,144 --> 00:36:09,509
You got me?

492
00:36:10,447 --> 00:36:12,347
Okay.

493
00:36:12,449 --> 00:36:14,100
I'll just watch TV or something.

494
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,936
That's a good idea.
Listen, honey.

495
00:36:15,986 --> 00:36:18,204
In another year you're gonna be 18.

496
00:36:18,254 --> 00:36:20,051
They won't be able to touch us then.

497
00:36:20,156 --> 00:36:22,215
Just don't worry
about anything, okay?

498
00:36:22,325 --> 00:36:24,411
I'm gonna take care of you
from here on out.

499
00:36:24,461 --> 00:36:26,019
You always have.

500
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,459
I love you.

501
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,763
Mm. Oh.

502
00:36:38,775 --> 00:36:40,105
Lock the door.

503
00:36:58,862 --> 00:37:04,467
<i>I didn't mean to,
but I'm sure I hurt Cindy real bad.</i>

504
00:37:08,738 --> 00:37:12,230
<i>I had saved almost $100
from my watercolors,</i>

505
00:37:12,342 --> 00:37:14,867
<i>just enough money
to get me out of the town,</i>

506
00:37:14,978 --> 00:37:16,809
<i>out of the county,</i>

507
00:37:16,913 --> 00:37:22,317
<i>and out of the state
of South Carolina forever!</i>

508
00:37:22,485 --> 00:37:27,479
<i>For the first time in my life,
I was really free.</i>

509
00:37:27,657 --> 00:37:31,991
<i># Jolene, Jolene#</i>

510
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:36,792
<i>I had all kinds of jobs.</i>

511
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,666
<i>There was always a YWCA,
where I could stay out of trouble,</i>

512
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:43,261
<i>and out of sight.</i>

513
00:37:43,373 --> 00:37:46,308
Hop in, darlin'.
Get your pretty little butt up here.

514
00:37:46,409 --> 00:37:49,401
<i>But I did have to take
a deep breath on occasion</i>

515
00:37:49,512 --> 00:37:52,072
<i>and sell it once or twice
across the country.</i>

516
00:37:52,182 --> 00:37:54,844
<i># When you dance on that... #</i>

517
00:37:54,951 --> 00:37:57,283
<i>I was just 17,</i>

518
00:37:57,387 --> 00:37:59,947
<i>but I carried myself
like I was 10 years older.</i>

519
00:38:00,056 --> 00:38:03,787
<i># I wonder, do you know#</i>

520
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:11,193
<i># How many hearts
you're gonna break#</i>

521
00:38:11,301 --> 00:38:12,791
Yeah!

522
00:38:12,902 --> 00:38:14,199
Ahh!

523
00:38:15,472 --> 00:38:20,171
<i># Jolene, Jolene#</i>

524
00:38:23,913 --> 00:38:28,680
<i># Yeah, you strut
just like a queen#</i>

525
00:38:31,855 --> 00:38:36,815
<i># You make all the boys
jump and shout#</i>

526
00:38:43,466 --> 00:38:49,701
<i># Jolene, Jolene, yeah, yeah#</i>

527
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,544
<i># If you want to be happy

<i># So from my personal
point of view... #</i>

530
00:39:06,089 --> 00:39:09,042
All right. Y'all got
two queenie burgers,

531
00:39:09,092 --> 00:39:10,024
fries, and a royal shake.

532
00:39:10,126 --> 00:39:11,115
$8.17, please.

533
00:39:11,227 --> 00:39:12,159
Keep the change.

534
00:39:12,262 --> 00:39:13,593
Hey, thanks!

535
00:39:13,696 --> 00:39:16,028
<i># So from my personal

536
00:39:16,132 --> 00:39:18,566

540
00:39:26,843 --> 00:39:29,368
<i># To do the things

541
00:39:29,479 --> 00:39:32,107
Hey, how come it's only
the guys that tip?

542
00:39:32,215 --> 00:39:34,334
'Cause the girls are jealous of you,
that's why.

543
00:39:34,384 --> 00:39:36,579
<i># An ugly woman

549
00:39:48,831 --> 00:39:51,586
Oh, that freak is here again.

550
00:39:52,068 --> 00:39:54,229
I can't stand him.
He gives me the creeps.

551
00:39:54,337 --> 00:39:58,000
Oh, come on, Kendra.
He's funny.

552
00:39:58,107 --> 00:39:59,267
Funny?

553
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:00,899
Funny-looking maybe.

554
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,875
No, I think he's kind of cute.

555
00:40:02,979 --> 00:40:05,948
Ew. Did you ever take a good whiff?

556
00:40:06,049 --> 00:40:08,415
I don't smell the customers, Kendra.

557
00:40:08,518 --> 00:40:10,884
Well, he reeks.

558
00:40:11,387 --> 00:40:13,540
Seems like he eats here every day.

559
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:16,320
Duh. He's not here
for the food, Jolene.

560
00:40:16,426 --> 00:40:17,859
He's got a crush on you.

561
00:40:17,961 --> 00:40:19,394
<i>He does not.</i>

562
00:40:19,495 --> 00:40:20,826
It's so obvious.

563
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:23,194
Why do you think
he's always asking for you?

564
00:40:23,299 --> 00:40:27,360
I don't know.
Because I'm a kick-ass waitress?

565
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:29,131
Don't worry.

566
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:31,804
<i>I'll take his order.</i>

567
00:40:39,482 --> 00:40:41,287
What can I get you?

568
00:40:42,819 --> 00:40:45,481
You can get me Jolene.

569
00:40:45,588 --> 00:40:46,973
<i>I want her to wait on me.</i>

570
00:40:47,023 --> 00:40:49,976
She's busy with other customers.

571
00:40:50,026 --> 00:40:52,961
Doesn't look too busy to me.

572
00:40:53,663 --> 00:40:54,755
I can wait.

573
00:40:54,931 --> 00:40:56,249
<i># Never make a pretty woman

574
00:40:56,299 --> 00:40:58,597

00:40:58,701 --> 00:41:01,487
<i># Get an ugly girl to marry you#</i>

576
00:41:01,537 --> 00:41:03,732
Just tell her I wrote her a song.

577
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,274
<i># Never make a pretty woman

578
00:41:06,376 --> 00:41:08,776

00:41:11,281 --> 00:41:15,134
<i># If you want to be happy

581
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:17,516
<i>He wants you to take his order.</i>

582
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:20,473
He said he wrote a song for you
or something like that.

583
00:41:20,523 --> 00:41:22,218
I can barely understand
a word he says.

584
00:41:22,325 --> 00:41:23,758
He wrote a song for me?

585
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:27,057
He's a loser. I bet he deals.

586
00:41:27,163 --> 00:41:29,927
Oh, I don't think he's that bad.

587
00:41:30,033 --> 00:41:32,797
<i>Fine. You take care of him, then.</i>

588
00:41:32,902 --> 00:41:36,132
I was only trying to help you out.

589
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:39,531
I can take care of myself.

590
00:41:42,178 --> 00:41:43,839
Nice to see you again.

591
00:41:43,946 --> 00:41:45,932
You sure must like this place.

592
00:41:45,982 --> 00:41:49,748
Where else in Phoenix
can I get service like this...

593
00:41:49,852 --> 00:41:52,150
from someone so charmin'?

594
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:56,625
I'd like to formally introduce myself.

595
00:41:56,726 --> 00:41:58,057
I'm Coco Leger.

596
00:41:58,861 --> 00:42:01,281
Originally from New Orleans.

597
00:42:01,331 --> 00:42:02,958
I'm Jolene.

598
00:42:03,132 --> 00:42:07,787
It says so right there
on your name tag. You mind?

599
00:42:08,137 --> 00:42:09,832
"Jolene. "

600
00:42:15,511 --> 00:42:19,641
<i># When I wake up in the mornin'#</i>

601
00:42:19,749 --> 00:42:23,480
<i># And I drive out to see Jolene#</i>

602
00:42:23,586 --> 00:42:27,273
<i># But my tongue gets tied
around a chili dog#</i>

603
00:42:27,323 --> 00:42:29,742
<i># She's my desert queen#</i>

604
00:42:29,792 --> 00:42:33,091
<i># She skates over to my window#</i>

605
00:42:33,196 --> 00:42:36,816
<i># A sweeter rack I've never seen#</i>

606
00:42:36,866 --> 00:42:39,596
<i># So you better not complain, girl#</i>

607
00:42:39,702 --> 00:42:43,536
<i># That I love you, Jole-e-e-ene! #</i>

608
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:54,777
Thank you.

609
00:42:54,884 --> 00:42:57,734
I got to get back to work now.

610
00:42:58,521 --> 00:43:00,673
You want to take a ride
in my Deuce Corona later?

611
00:43:00,723 --> 00:43:02,475
Maybe some other time.

612
00:43:02,525 --> 00:43:06,895
You wanna go dancin' with me
on Saturday night?

613
00:43:07,864 --> 00:43:08,558
<i># Whoo! #</i>

614
00:43:08,664 --> 00:43:10,598
<i># Super highways#</i>

615
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,725
<i># Coast to coast#</i>

<i># On the transcontinental#</i>

00:43:23,346 --> 00:43:24,904
<i># How does it feel? #</i>

621
00:43:25,014 --> 00:43:27,209
<i># When there's no destination#</i>

622
00:43:27,316 --> 00:43:29,402
<i># That's too far#</i>

623
00:43:29,452 --> 00:43:33,373
<i># And somewhere on the way,
you might find out who you are#</i>

624
00:43:33,423 --> 00:43:33,946
<i># Whoo! #</i>

625
00:43:34,056 --> 00:43:36,752
<i># Living in America#</i>

626
00:43:36,926 --> 00:43:37,950
<i># Oh! #</i>

627
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,960
<i># Eye to eye#</i>

628
00:43:40,062 --> 00:43:42,121
<i># Station to station#</i>

<i># Living in America#</i>

630
00:43:44,033 --> 00:43:45,898
<i>He was no rock star,</i>

631
00:43:46,002 --> 00:43:48,095
<i>but he was a gentleman
and a good dancer,</i>

632
00:43:48,204 --> 00:43:51,867
<i>and he didn't mind
making a fool of himself.</i>

633
00:43:51,974 --> 00:43:54,634
<i>I kind of liked that.</i>

634
00:43:56,312 --> 00:43:58,497
<i># I feel good! #</i>

635
00:44:12,595 --> 00:44:14,688
<i>But mostly...</i>

636
00:44:14,797 --> 00:44:17,362
<i>...he made me laugh.</i>

637
00:44:18,167 --> 00:44:23,487
<i>And I hadn't had a reason to laugh
in a long time.</i>

638
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:30,401
Well, this is it.

639
00:44:31,147 --> 00:44:32,978
This is who I am.

640
00:44:35,017 --> 00:44:36,848
You own this place?

641
00:44:37,019 --> 00:44:40,740
Whose name do you see up there
in the lights?

642
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:42,587
Wow!

643
00:44:42,758 --> 00:44:44,944
Started it up with a grand
and a prayer.

644
00:44:44,994 --> 00:44:47,519
<i>That is so cool.</i>

645
00:45:12,822 --> 00:45:14,907
Are these your designs?

646
00:45:14,957 --> 00:45:17,187
Art don't belong to anybody.

647
00:45:17,293 --> 00:45:20,146
We are merely the fortunate vessels
that channel it.

648
00:45:20,196 --> 00:45:22,130
You know...

649
00:45:22,665 --> 00:45:24,064
...I draw.

650
00:45:25,034 --> 00:45:25,934
Oh, yeah?

651
00:45:26,802 --> 00:45:29,747
I've been told I'm pretty good.

652
00:45:30,139 --> 00:45:32,799
Oh, I bet you have, darlin'.

653
00:45:33,276 --> 00:45:35,767
Here, take a bang.

654
00:45:35,878 --> 00:45:36,867
No.

655
00:45:38,714 --> 00:45:42,301
See? It's a little like
paintin' with a needle.

656
00:45:42,351 --> 00:45:44,376
Intense...

657
00:45:44,487 --> 00:45:46,387
and complicated.

658
00:45:46,489 --> 00:45:50,099
And that's why I call it an institute.

659
00:45:51,794 --> 00:45:53,694
Come on, give it a try.
It ain't gonna hurt ya.

660
00:45:53,796 --> 00:45:56,456
Let's get institutionalized.

661
00:46:02,538 --> 00:46:05,530
<i>I just love art.</i>

662
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:07,802
Any kind.

663
00:46:09,445 --> 00:46:13,472
I especially like
doing portraits, but...

664
00:46:14,917 --> 00:46:15,701
Oh.

665
00:46:15,751 --> 00:46:17,582
Say "ah. "

666
00:46:19,722 --> 00:46:22,054
Ahhhh.

667
00:46:36,005 --> 00:46:37,597
Be my apprentice.

668
00:46:39,342 --> 00:46:40,900
Are you serious?

669
00:46:41,077 --> 00:46:42,442
Yeah, I'm serious.

670
00:46:42,545 --> 00:46:44,706
I just fired the chick
who worked for me.

671
00:46:44,814 --> 00:46:47,949
She had a face
like a smacked ass.

672
00:46:49,051 --> 00:46:51,383
You can start with stock tattoos.

673
00:46:51,487 --> 00:46:56,576
Time will tell whether you truly are
also a fortunate vessel.

674
00:46:56,626 --> 00:46:58,431
I'm a fast learner.

675
00:46:58,494 --> 00:47:00,860
That's what I'm sayin', babe.

676
00:47:00,963 --> 00:47:07,518
Now, sit tight, and let me show you
what Coco can do when he channels.

677
00:47:10,306 --> 00:47:12,365
Ugh. That is just so gross.

678
00:47:12,475 --> 00:47:14,443
I can't believe you let him
touch you there.

679
00:47:14,543 --> 00:47:16,253
I think it's sexy.

680
00:47:17,647 --> 00:47:19,031
I guess that makes it official.

681
00:47:19,081 --> 00:47:21,534
You're just mad
'cause I'm moving out.

682
00:47:21,584 --> 00:47:24,246
I don't mind you moving out.

683
00:47:24,353 --> 00:47:27,273
I just wish you would've picked
somebody else to move in with.

684
00:47:27,323 --> 00:47:29,484
You've only known him
a couple weeks.

685
00:47:29,592 --> 00:47:31,753
He gave me a job.

686
00:47:31,861 --> 00:47:34,295
I have an artistic job.

687
00:47:34,397 --> 00:47:39,242
You think that little heart
on your ass is artistic?

688
00:47:39,568 --> 00:47:42,264
I knew you wouldn't understand.

689
00:47:42,371 --> 00:47:43,565
<i>He believes in me.</i>

690
00:47:43,673 --> 00:47:44,833
It's an act.

691
00:47:45,007 --> 00:47:47,857
You're gonna get hurt, Jolene.

692
00:47:49,912 --> 00:47:52,498
<i>I see what he sees in you.</i>

693
00:47:52,548 --> 00:47:53,480
Thank you.

694
00:47:53,649 --> 00:47:57,734
<i>But I cannot see
what you see in him.</i>

695
00:48:27,917 --> 00:48:30,010
Coco was right on.

696
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:31,313
Nice.

697
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:32,250
Trust, Sid.

698
00:48:32,354 --> 00:48:34,413
All you got to do is have the trust.

699
00:48:34,523 --> 00:48:35,820
I told you she had talent.

700
00:48:35,925 --> 00:48:41,150
Yeah, if she didn't,
I'd kick your ass around the block.

701
00:48:46,135 --> 00:48:47,720
Hey, uh, you hang on to that woman.

702
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:50,136
All right, man?
She's ripe.

703
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:52,036
Fuck off.

704
00:49:02,718 --> 00:49:06,233
You did it, baby.
You made Coco proud.

705
00:50:03,179 --> 00:50:04,794
Let's just do it.

706
00:50:13,189 --> 00:50:15,214
Was I wrong here?

707
00:50:20,429 --> 00:50:21,794
No.

708
00:50:23,866 --> 00:50:25,891
It's just that I was
already married once,

709
00:50:26,001 --> 00:50:28,946
and it didn't work out so good.

710
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:34,202
I mean, it's sweet, Coco.

711
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:37,211
It's real, real sweet.

712
00:50:42,017 --> 00:50:44,451
But I don't think so.

713
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,495
But you're the one, babe.

714
00:50:47,857 --> 00:50:49,842
Babe, I've heard that before.

715
00:50:49,892 --> 00:50:51,257
Not from me.

716
00:50:52,595 --> 00:50:56,429
No, I'm an orphan in the storm
just like you are.

717
00:50:56,532 --> 00:51:00,997
Now, they didn't much like me
where I came from.

718
00:51:01,737 --> 00:51:02,897
Hell, as I understand it,

719
00:51:03,005 --> 00:51:06,992
neither of us has a past
to write home about.

720
00:51:07,042 --> 00:51:09,704
I think we both know...

721
00:51:09,812 --> 00:51:12,474
there's more to life than...

722
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:15,180
...that.

723
00:51:16,785 --> 00:51:19,171
What counts
is this very moment...

724
00:51:19,221 --> 00:51:21,849
and the future moments.

725
00:51:21,957 --> 00:51:24,790
And all the other moments
is just bullshit.

726
00:51:24,894 --> 00:51:26,794
See what I'm saying?

727
00:51:29,365 --> 00:51:34,495
We artists gotta stick together
if we're gonna survive.

728
00:51:35,104 --> 00:51:37,766
I love you, Jolene.

729
00:51:39,742 --> 00:51:41,437
Please say yes.

730
00:51:46,515 --> 00:51:48,642
<i>I knew nothing
about him...</i>

731
00:51:48,751 --> 00:51:52,414
<i>his past, his family.</i>

732
00:51:52,521 --> 00:51:55,581
<i>I knew nothing.</i>

733
00:51:55,691 --> 00:52:00,025
<i>But when I said the name
"Jolene Leger'</i>

734
00:52:00,129 --> 00:52:02,781
<i>secretly to myself...</i>

735
00:52:02,831 --> 00:52:04,162
I do.

736
00:52:04,266 --> 00:52:08,464
<i>...I thought it had a nice ring to it.</i>

737
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:10,970
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

738
00:52:11,073 --> 00:52:13,337
<i># If I give my heart to you#</i>

739
00:52:13,442 --> 00:52:15,706
Whoo! Yeah!

740
00:52:15,811 --> 00:52:19,041
<i># Are you gonna break it? #</i>

741
00:52:20,249 --> 00:52:24,686
<i># If I give my hand to you#</i>

742
00:52:24,787 --> 00:52:27,922
<i># Are you gonna take it? #</i>

743
00:52:46,075 --> 00:52:50,739
<i># Jolene, my desert queen#</i>

744
00:52:50,846 --> 00:52:56,284
<i># Gonna take you to heaven
on the love machine#</i>

745
00:52:56,385 --> 00:53:01,135
<i># Gonna fill your vessel
with my Coco cream#</i>

746
00:53:01,857 --> 00:53:04,917
<i># You're the finest piece of ass#</i>

747
00:53:05,027 --> 00:53:07,782
<i># That I've ever seen#</i>

748
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:30,509
<i>If you shaved his beard,
scrubbed off the tattoos,</i>

749
00:53:30,686 --> 00:53:33,985
<i>got rid of his boots
with the lifts in them,</i>

750
00:53:34,089 --> 00:53:39,124
<i>and gave him a haircut
and a pair of glasses...</i>

751
00:53:40,062 --> 00:53:44,432
<i>...he would've looked
a lot like Mickey.</i>

752
00:54:07,923 --> 00:54:10,414
That looks mighty fine.

753
00:54:12,494 --> 00:54:14,346
And so does the tattoo.

754
00:54:14,396 --> 00:54:15,795
It better.

755
00:54:17,266 --> 00:54:18,917
Where are you off to?

756
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:20,285
Just business.

757
00:54:20,335 --> 00:54:22,330
When you coming back?

758
00:54:31,947 --> 00:54:33,832
<i>Where's he going in such a hurry?</i>

759
00:54:33,882 --> 00:54:35,117
I don't know.

760
00:54:36,118 --> 00:54:40,013
He's away in his stupid car
half the time.

761
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:04,074
What do you think he's doing
in there all this time?

762
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:07,637
Duh, he's dealing drugs
just like I told you he was.

763
00:55:07,749 --> 00:55:10,479
No, he wouldn't do that to me.

764
00:55:10,586 --> 00:55:11,450
Get real, Jolene.

765
00:55:11,553 --> 00:55:15,638
What else do you think
is going on in there?

766
00:55:20,829 --> 00:55:22,634
I'm gonna find out.

767
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:27,835
Are you insane?!
Get back in here!

768
00:55:38,347 --> 00:55:40,747
Whoa, whoa! What the hell
are you doin' here?!

769
00:55:40,849 --> 00:55:43,215
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
You're gonna get yourself killed!

770
00:55:43,318 --> 00:55:44,603
Are you dealing, Coco?

771
00:55:44,653 --> 00:55:47,239
Just calm down, all right?
Just keep it down.

772
00:55:47,289 --> 00:55:52,324
<i>Answer me. I want to know now.
Are you dealing?</i>

773
00:55:52,628 --> 00:55:54,687
Babe...

774
00:55:54,796 --> 00:55:58,596
it's the only way
to keep the shop going.

775
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:01,600
Dealing, Coco?! Why the hell
do you have to do that?!

776
00:56:01,703 --> 00:56:04,458
<i>You don't question me!</i>

777
00:56:05,707 --> 00:56:07,038
Do you hear me?

778
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:12,395
I'm doin' the best I can
for the both of us.

779
00:56:12,781 --> 00:56:13,731
Come here.

780
00:56:13,782 --> 00:56:15,397
- No.
- Come here.

781
00:56:26,028 --> 00:56:30,226
No artist in the USA can make it

782
00:56:30,332 --> 00:56:35,554
if he didn't lubricate his vessel
with a little somethin' on the side.

783
00:56:35,604 --> 00:56:37,723
You're so full of shit.

784
00:56:37,773 --> 00:56:38,831
Oh, come on, baby.

785
00:56:38,941 --> 00:56:41,160
Coco would never do anything
to hurt you.

786
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:43,110
"Oh, baby," nothing.

787
00:56:45,681 --> 00:56:48,436
You better not hurt me, Coco.

788
00:56:49,785 --> 00:56:52,160
Or I might hurt you back.

789
00:57:31,126 --> 00:57:34,493
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Coco Leger.

790
00:57:34,596 --> 00:57:35,255
Is he here?

791
00:57:35,364 --> 00:57:36,264
No.

792
00:57:36,765 --> 00:57:39,885
Well, do you know
when he'll be back?

793
00:57:39,935 --> 00:57:41,732
Who wants to know?

794
00:57:43,739 --> 00:57:47,470
<i>Mrs. Coco Leger, the wife.</i>

795
00:57:48,944 --> 00:57:52,554
<i>You... you mean ex-wife, right?</i>

796
00:57:55,751 --> 00:57:58,316
He didn't tell you, did he?

797
00:58:00,489 --> 00:58:01,421
Whoa!

798
00:58:03,659 --> 00:58:05,286
Listen, you little slut!

799
00:58:05,394 --> 00:58:07,954
I have spent
every fucking cent I have

800
00:58:08,063 --> 00:58:10,190
tracking down that bastard!

801
00:58:10,299 --> 00:58:12,290
Do not waste my time.

802
00:58:12,401 --> 00:58:13,919
Fucking find him!

803
00:58:13,969 --> 00:58:16,904
I told you, he's not here.

804
00:58:17,773 --> 00:58:19,863
Will you look at this!

805
00:58:20,709 --> 00:58:23,654
Here. Fucking hold him, please.

806
00:58:23,745 --> 00:58:25,940
That son of a bitch.

807
00:58:26,615 --> 00:58:28,446
Uh...

808
00:58:29,284 --> 00:58:30,342
Damn, girl.
Where have you...

809
00:58:30,452 --> 00:58:31,783
Bastard!

810
00:58:31,887 --> 00:58:32,546
...been?

811
00:58:32,654 --> 00:58:33,382
Asshole!

812
00:58:33,488 --> 00:58:34,750
Now, Marin, just be cool.

813
00:58:34,856 --> 00:58:38,371
There's an explanation
for everything.

814
00:58:40,495 --> 00:58:42,292
<i>You got one for me?</i>

815
00:58:42,397 --> 00:58:45,450
<i>Let's see you sweet-talk your way
out of this one, asshole.</i>

816
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,593
Now, Marin, believe it or not,

817
00:58:47,703 --> 00:58:50,831
I am greatly relieved
to see you and, um...

818
00:58:50,939 --> 00:58:52,839
- Coco Jr.
- Mm.

819
00:58:52,941 --> 00:58:56,395
So if you just like to come this way,
we can take a ride.

820
00:58:56,445 --> 00:58:57,896
Are you kidding me?

821
00:58:57,946 --> 00:59:00,565
Just sit tight, Jolene.
I'll be back soon. Hmm?

822
00:59:00,615 --> 00:59:02,990
Step to the right, honey.

823
00:59:21,103 --> 00:59:22,866
Ugh!

824
00:59:32,981 --> 00:59:35,211
You know, I draw!

825
01:00:54,863 --> 01:00:57,730
<i>911. Please state your emergency.</i>

826
01:00:57,833 --> 01:01:00,303
<i>Hello? This is 911.</i>

827
01:01:00,502 --> 01:01:04,302
<i>The weirdest feeling
came over me.</i>

828
01:01:04,606 --> 01:01:07,741
<i>I felt like a child again,</i>

829
01:01:08,143 --> 01:01:11,806
<i>like I was only a pretend adult</i>

830
01:01:11,913 --> 01:01:15,906
<i>and that I was never
Mrs. Coco Leger.</i>

831
01:01:16,017 --> 01:01:19,646
<i>For the first time in a long time,</i>

832
01:01:19,754 --> 01:01:23,747
<i>I wondered who my real parents
might have been,</i>

833
01:01:23,859 --> 01:01:27,317
<i>if they were still alive,</i>

834
01:01:27,429 --> 01:01:31,989
<i>and why they bothered
to name me Jolene...</i>

835
01:01:32,501 --> 01:01:37,346
<i>only to leave me
to the authorities to raise.</i>

836
01:02:28,823 --> 01:02:31,314
<i># Since you've gone#</i>

837
01:02:31,493 --> 01:02:37,762
<i># I spend each lonely night#</i>

838
01:02:37,866 --> 01:02:46,001
<i># Dealing out the cards
from left to right#</i>

839
01:02:46,107 --> 01:02:53,377
<i># And the king of hearts
is there to remind me#</i>

840
01:02:54,316 --> 01:03:02,451
<i># That I'm all alone,
playing solitaire#</i>

841
01:03:03,658 --> 01:03:11,155
<i># Love was just another game
for two#</i>

842
01:03:11,266 --> 01:03:18,263
<i># I see now that's all
it meant to you#</i>

843
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:26,512
<i># And my heart got lost
somewhere in the shuffle#</i>

844
01:03:27,082 --> 01:03:34,454
<i># So I'm all alone
playing solitaire#</i>

845
01:03:38,727 --> 01:03:44,256
<i># In each romance#</i>

846
01:03:44,366 --> 01:03:48,302
<i># There's an element of chance#</i>

847
01:03:48,970 --> 01:03:54,602
<i># A gamble to win or to lose#</i>

848
01:03:55,343 --> 01:03:59,439
<i># You play to win#</i>

849
01:03:59,547 --> 01:04:05,281
<i># Then you find
you're playing in a game#</i>

850
01:04:05,387 --> 01:04:08,481
<i># With no rules#</i>

851
01:04:08,590 --> 01:04:12,390
<i># Just made for fools#</i>

852
01:04:12,494 --> 01:04:19,161
<i># Now the joker
has a laugh on me#</i>

853
01:04:19,768 --> 01:04:27,903
<i># 'Cause I've played my hand
so carelessly#</i>

854
01:04:28,009 --> 01:04:34,881
<i># And until you want to share
that old feeling#</i>

855
01:04:35,884 --> 01:04:41,652
<i># I'll be dealing time away#</i>

856
01:04:41,756 --> 01:04:44,987
<i># Dealing time away#</i>

857
01:04:45,093 --> 01:04:53,228
<i># With solitaire#</i>

858
01:05:28,203 --> 01:05:32,457
Sal, this is Baby.
She's one of our finest dancers.

859
01:05:32,507 --> 01:05:34,559
It's a pleasure to meet you.

860
01:05:34,609 --> 01:05:36,372
Hello.

861
01:05:37,178 --> 01:05:40,408
Can I buy you
a glass of champagne?

862
01:05:40,882 --> 01:05:42,577
I'd rather give you a dance.

863
01:05:42,684 --> 01:05:44,675
That's not necessary.

864
01:05:44,853 --> 01:05:46,115
I just want to talk.

865
01:05:46,221 --> 01:05:47,882
Why don't you ask your boss
if you can sit here

866
01:05:47,989 --> 01:05:49,774
and join me for a little while?

867
01:05:49,824 --> 01:05:51,409
Anything for you, Sal.

868
01:05:51,459 --> 01:05:53,359
Thanks. Sit.

869
01:06:00,235 --> 01:06:04,137
I'm Sal Fontaine, and you're... Baby.

870
01:06:06,107 --> 01:06:08,059
Actually, I'm Jolene.

871
01:06:08,109 --> 01:06:09,736
Jolene?

872
01:06:09,844 --> 01:06:12,608
Well, Jolene, I was really taken
by your performance out there.

873
01:06:12,714 --> 01:06:14,079
You're a very gifted dancer.

874
01:06:14,182 --> 01:06:16,462
Did you study somewhere?

875
01:06:18,086 --> 01:06:20,554
No. I just like music.

876
01:06:20,722 --> 01:06:23,555
Well, it certainly shows.

877
01:06:23,658 --> 01:06:25,091
You're stunning.

878
01:06:25,894 --> 01:06:27,828
Thank you.

879
01:06:27,996 --> 01:06:28,826
You're welcome.

880
01:06:28,930 --> 01:06:30,727
I'm trying to decide
if I like "Jolene" better

881
01:06:30,832 --> 01:06:33,967
or "Baby" better... I don't know.

882
01:06:47,615 --> 01:06:50,106
<i>Sal was a gentleman.</i>

883
01:06:50,218 --> 01:06:53,779
<i>He never sat at the stage
to stare at my ass like the others.</i>

884
01:06:53,888 --> 01:06:55,913
<i>He was highly respected
in the community</i>

885
01:06:56,024 --> 01:06:57,855
<i>as the owner of Sal's Line.</i>

886
01:06:57,959 --> 01:07:00,621
<i>He gave people advice
on everything...</i>

887
01:07:00,728 --> 01:07:02,647
<i>like about horses</i>

888
01:07:02,697 --> 01:07:04,995
<i>or like who would be
the next president,</i>

889
01:07:05,099 --> 01:07:07,085
<i>and he was usually right.</i>

890
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:13,025
<i>That was the kind of solid citizen
Mr. Sal Fontaine was.</i>

891
01:07:16,477 --> 01:07:18,947
You live in a museum, Sal.

892
01:07:20,481 --> 01:07:22,847
This place is incredible.

893
01:07:22,951 --> 01:07:24,976
You know, they have a wonderful
museum right here in town.

894
01:07:25,086 --> 01:07:28,006
I can take you there if you like.

895
01:07:28,056 --> 01:07:29,340
That'd be nice.

896
01:07:29,390 --> 01:07:31,085
All right.

897
01:07:35,630 --> 01:07:37,916
Where'd you get
all these beautiful things?

898
01:07:37,966 --> 01:07:40,833
I have a habit of collecting things.
I can't help it.

899
01:07:40,935 --> 01:07:44,450
When I see something I like,
I buy it.

900
01:07:46,007 --> 01:07:47,702
So, you like art?

901
01:07:47,809 --> 01:07:49,071
Mm, I love it.

902
01:07:49,177 --> 01:07:50,144
I can see.

903
01:07:53,448 --> 01:07:56,747
Oh, my God, it's like Christmas!

904
01:07:56,851 --> 01:07:59,376
<i>It is Christmas, princess.
Come on, let me show you.</i>

905
01:07:59,487 --> 01:08:01,580
Come on.

906
01:08:10,031 --> 01:08:13,933
<i>You must be real happy
living up here in your sky palace.</i>

907
01:08:14,035 --> 01:08:17,198
Under the right circumstances,
you can be happy living anywhere.

908
01:08:17,305 --> 01:08:18,670
Come on, I want
to show you something.

909
01:08:18,773 --> 01:08:19,673
Come on.

910
01:08:23,077 --> 01:08:24,942
Give me your coat.

911
01:08:32,353 --> 01:08:34,321
Beautiful, isn't she?

912
01:08:37,825 --> 01:08:40,225
It's my greatest possession.

913
01:08:40,328 --> 01:08:41,295
Hmm.

914
01:08:45,133 --> 01:08:47,567
Reminds me of you.

915
01:08:57,545 --> 01:08:59,864
You did all this for me, didn't you?

916
01:08:59,914 --> 01:09:02,007
All for you, princess.

917
01:09:08,556 --> 01:09:10,275
Who are all these people, Sal?

918
01:09:10,325 --> 01:09:13,488
Oh, relatives, kids.

919
01:09:13,661 --> 01:09:15,179
Do they live here?

920
01:09:15,229 --> 01:09:16,681
No, they all moved away.

921
01:09:16,731 --> 01:09:17,949
Do you ever get to see them?

922
01:09:17,999 --> 01:09:19,296
Not too often.

923
01:09:24,839 --> 01:09:26,454
That was my wife.

924
01:09:26,507 --> 01:09:28,026
She's beautiful.

925
01:09:28,076 --> 01:09:30,010
Thank you. She was.

926
01:09:30,111 --> 01:09:32,238
She died a long time ago.

927
01:09:32,347 --> 01:09:35,197
The pictures are old, like me.

928
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:37,281
You're not so old.

929
01:09:41,289 --> 01:09:42,740
I'm not so young, either.

930
01:09:42,790 --> 01:09:45,076
I don't think age
makes any difference.

931
01:09:45,126 --> 01:09:47,026
You know what?
I don't think so, either.

932
01:09:47,128 --> 01:09:49,213
Life is about moments.

933
01:09:49,263 --> 01:09:53,538
When you find a good one,
you don't let it go.

934
01:09:55,069 --> 01:09:57,037
Let me ask you a question, Jolene.

935
01:09:57,138 --> 01:10:01,603
What are the odds of you
moving in here with me?

936
01:10:02,343 --> 01:10:06,230
I'd say that'd be
a pretty risky bet, Sal.

937
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:07,542
Really?

938
01:10:07,715 --> 01:10:09,842
Mm-hmm.

939
01:10:11,185 --> 01:10:14,985
Jolene, stop dancing
and move in with me.

940
01:10:16,991 --> 01:10:18,309
Are you serious?

941
01:10:18,359 --> 01:10:21,487
I told you once...
I never say anything I don't mean.

942
01:10:21,596 --> 01:10:24,541
And I never go back on my word.

943
01:10:28,136 --> 01:10:30,195
This is for you.

944
01:10:31,472 --> 01:10:33,291
There's no limit on it.

945
01:10:33,341 --> 01:10:35,206
You could have
your own beauty parlor,

946
01:10:35,309 --> 01:10:39,597
Olympic-sized swimming pool, spa,
maid service every morning.

947
01:10:39,647 --> 01:10:41,342
You could order food 24 hours a day,

948
01:10:41,449 --> 01:10:44,869
whenever you want,
whatever you want.

949
01:10:45,553 --> 01:10:48,403
All you have to do is say yes.

950
01:10:48,856 --> 01:10:52,561
Why me? You could have
anybody you want.

951
01:10:52,994 --> 01:10:55,155
I don't want anybody else.

952
01:10:55,263 --> 01:10:57,231
I want you.

953
01:10:57,832 --> 01:11:00,528
You don't want me. Trust me.

954
01:11:00,701 --> 01:11:03,135
Don't sell yourself short, Jolene.

955
01:11:03,237 --> 01:11:04,689
You deserve the best there is,

956
01:11:04,739 --> 01:11:07,589
even if you don't know it yet.

957
01:11:07,842 --> 01:11:09,794
Let me take care of you,

958
01:11:09,844 --> 01:11:14,132
and in return, I'll have
the pleasure of your company.

959
01:11:14,182 --> 01:11:17,049
And you can walk out that door
any time you want...

960
01:11:17,151 --> 01:11:18,914
no strings.

961
01:11:23,858 --> 01:11:26,656
What do you say? Huh?

962
01:11:33,301 --> 01:11:35,098
Hmm?

963
01:11:37,438 --> 01:11:38,564
Merry Christmas.

964
01:11:38,673 --> 01:11:42,666
<i>He believed, or pretended
to believe, my life story.</i>

965
01:11:42,777 --> 01:11:43,801
Merry Christmas.

966
01:11:43,911 --> 01:11:50,656
<i>The parts that were made up,
as well as the parts that were true.</i>

967
01:11:51,319 --> 01:11:54,755
<i># Heavenly shades of night
are falling#</i>

968
01:11:54,856 --> 01:11:57,275
<i># It's twilight time#</i>

969
01:11:57,325 --> 01:12:00,920
<i># Out of the mist,
your voice is calling#</i>

970
01:12:01,028 --> 01:12:03,826
<i># 'tis twilight time#</i>

971
01:12:03,998 --> 01:12:09,459
<i># When purple-colored curtains
mark the end of day#</i>

972
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:14,132
<i># I'll hear you, my dear,
at twilight time#</i>

973
01:12:14,242 --> 01:12:16,210
It's so beautiful here.

974
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:18,676
You should have seen it
30 years ago, princess.

975
01:12:18,779 --> 01:12:20,269
The Sands, The Flamingo.

976
01:12:20,381 --> 01:12:21,643
They were hotels.

977
01:12:21,749 --> 01:12:23,580
That was Vegas.

978
01:12:23,684 --> 01:12:24,776
Not like it is now.

979
01:12:24,886 --> 01:12:27,081
All these hotels...
they're amusement parks.

980
01:12:27,188 --> 01:12:28,780
Back then, everybody
was dressed up...

981
01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:32,910
tuxedos... we'd drink martinis,
share our olives together.

982
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:33,949
What do you mean?

983
01:12:34,061 --> 01:12:35,255
We would drink our martinis,

984
01:12:35,363 --> 01:12:36,853
and at the end,
we would share our olives.

985
01:12:36,964 --> 01:12:40,525
It was a sign of friendship, respect.

986
01:12:41,569 --> 01:12:47,701
<i># Here in the afterglow of day#</i>

987
01:12:47,875 --> 01:12:53,142
<i># We keep our rendezvous
beneath the blue#</i>

988
01:12:53,848 --> 01:12:59,616
<i># Here in the sweet
and same old way#</i>

989
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:06,057
<i># I fall in love again
as I did then#</i>

990
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:09,596
<i># Deep in the dark,
your kiss will thrill me#</i>

991
01:13:09,697 --> 01:13:12,131
<i># Like days of old#</i>

992
01:13:12,233 --> 01:13:14,531
<i># Lighting the spark of love... #</i>

993
01:13:14,635 --> 01:13:18,055
<i>I would tell him I loved him,</i>

994
01:13:18,372 --> 01:13:22,331
<i>and at the moment I said it, I did.</i>

995
01:13:22,443 --> 01:13:24,638
<i># Just to be with you#</i>

996
01:13:24,745 --> 01:13:31,309
<i># Together, at last at twilight time#</i>

997
01:13:32,019 --> 01:13:36,103
<i># Here in the afterglow of day#</i>

998
01:13:36,153 --> 01:13:40,218
<i># We keep our rendezvous... #</i>

999
01:13:40,328 --> 01:13:42,057
What's the matter, princess?

1000
01:13:42,163 --> 01:13:43,687
Well, I'm just a little nervous

1001
01:13:43,798 --> 01:13:45,698
about meeting your friends,
that's all.

1002
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:48,325
Are you kidding? Come on.
They're gonna love you.

1003
01:13:48,436 --> 01:13:52,089
<i>Let me tell you something.
Everybody loves you.</i>

1004
01:13:52,139 --> 01:13:56,166
<i># As I did then#</i>

1005
01:13:56,277 --> 01:13:57,471
Hey. Frank.

1006
01:13:57,578 --> 01:13:59,011
- Sal, good to see you.
- Jimmy.

1007
01:13:59,113 --> 01:14:00,705
How you doing?
- This is Jolene.

1008
01:14:00,815 --> 01:14:03,534
- Hey, Jolene.
- Nice to meet you.

1009
01:14:03,584 --> 01:14:05,469
I guess we're not talking
business tonight.

1010
01:14:05,519 --> 01:14:07,638
Come on. You know the routine.
All right?

1011
01:14:07,688 --> 01:14:09,974
Hey, Sal, I was just hoping we could
talk about the new accounts.

1012
01:14:10,024 --> 01:14:13,077
Can we have a nice night? Huh?
Let's have a nice night.

1013
01:14:13,127 --> 01:14:14,679
Sal, with all due respect...

1014
01:14:14,729 --> 01:14:15,846
Are you deaf?

1015
01:14:15,896 --> 01:14:18,330
Hey, Sal,
Frank has a few propositions

1016
01:14:18,432 --> 01:14:20,151
he wants to run by you.

1017
01:14:20,201 --> 01:14:22,362
I'm running things
for 25 years one way,

1018
01:14:22,470 --> 01:14:23,921
and that's the way it stays.

1019
01:14:23,971 --> 01:14:25,461
Hey, all he's asking you
is to keep an open mind.

1020
01:14:25,573 --> 01:14:26,924
We don't have to talk about it now.

1021
01:14:26,974 --> 01:14:28,635
<i>No, we don't have to talk
about it now...</i>

1022
01:14:28,743 --> 01:14:29,607
or ever.

1023
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:35,205
Okay. Whatever you say, Sal.

1024
01:14:35,383 --> 01:14:38,803
<i>That's right. Whatever I say.</i>

1025
01:14:41,756 --> 01:14:43,341
You having a good time, honey?

1026
01:14:43,391 --> 01:14:44,790
Mm-hmm.

1027
01:14:50,798 --> 01:14:52,060
Hey.

1028
01:14:52,166 --> 01:14:53,428
Hey.

1029
01:14:53,534 --> 01:14:56,367
<i>Sal was usually out
doing business.</i>

1030
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:59,320
<i>He was always stressed.</i>

1031
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:04,128
<i>But he allowed me to do
whatever I wanted.</i>

1032
01:15:04,178 --> 01:15:08,453
<i>My life had become
comfortable, secure.</i>

1033
01:15:08,716 --> 01:15:13,517
<i>It was like eating cotton candy
all day long.</i>

1034
01:15:18,125 --> 01:15:21,617
What's the matter, Sal? You okay?

1035
01:15:22,596 --> 01:15:24,591
I love you, princess.

1036
01:15:26,334 --> 01:15:28,268
I love you, too.

1037
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:30,960
Come here.

1038
01:15:39,513 --> 01:15:41,708
I just want you to know

1039
01:15:42,683 --> 01:15:46,141
that you never have to worry
about anything.

1040
01:15:46,253 --> 01:15:49,313
You'll always be taken care of...

1041
01:15:49,423 --> 01:15:52,290
even after I'm gone.

1042
01:15:52,393 --> 01:15:53,792
You're not going anywhere, Sal.

1043
01:15:53,894 --> 01:15:56,624
I know, I know, I know.

1044
01:15:56,797 --> 01:15:58,788
You're becoming an artist,
princess.

1045
01:15:58,899 --> 01:16:00,423
A real artist.

1046
01:16:14,849 --> 01:16:20,037
Did you see everybody staring at you
when we came in? Huh?

1047
01:16:20,087 --> 01:16:20,987
Yeah.

1048
01:16:22,490 --> 01:16:24,770
Are you happy, princess?

1049
01:16:25,459 --> 01:16:28,012
You make me happier
than I've ever been.

1050
01:16:28,062 --> 01:16:31,197
Good. That's what I want to hear.

1051
01:16:35,669 --> 01:16:38,994
Hey, Sal.
Aren't those your friends?

1052
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:47,574
Yeah.

1053
01:16:47,748 --> 01:16:49,066
Should we go say hello?

1054
01:16:49,116 --> 01:16:52,156
<i>No. Tonight's your night.</i>

1055
01:16:58,959 --> 01:17:00,290
I don't care
what New York says.

1056
01:17:00,394 --> 01:17:02,294
I told you a thousand times,
this is Vegas.

1057
01:17:02,396 --> 01:17:05,126
<i>I do things my way here.</i>

1058
01:17:05,232 --> 01:17:07,530
What?

1059
01:17:07,635 --> 01:17:09,432
Yeah. Now? All right.
Come on up. Yeah.

1060
01:17:09,537 --> 01:17:11,698
You want to do it now?
Let's do it now.

1061
01:17:11,806 --> 01:17:13,569
Yeah, okay.

1062
01:17:17,711 --> 01:17:19,269
- Jolene.
- Hmm?

1063
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:21,712
Jolene, wake up, baby.
Come on, baby, wake up.

1064
01:17:21,816 --> 01:17:23,044
- Ohh.
- Come on.

1065
01:17:23,150 --> 01:17:24,845
I want you to wake up.
All right? Wake up.

1066
01:17:24,952 --> 01:17:25,941
I want you to get dressed.

1067
01:17:26,053 --> 01:17:28,146
I want you to go downstairs
and wait for me, okay?

1068
01:17:28,255 --> 01:17:29,244
Why?

1069
01:17:29,423 --> 01:17:31,482
Because I've got a meeting
with the guys right now.

1070
01:17:31,592 --> 01:17:33,025
- Now?
- Yes, now!

1071
01:17:33,127 --> 01:17:35,513
I can't blow them off anymore.
I got to see them.

1072
01:17:35,563 --> 01:17:37,588
I'll just have some juice
and go back to...

1073
01:17:37,698 --> 01:17:40,030
No! You're not staying in bed.

1074
01:17:40,134 --> 01:17:43,001
You're gonna go downstairs,
you're gonna get dressed right now,

1075
01:17:43,103 --> 01:17:45,071
and you're gonna wait for me,
all right?

1076
01:17:45,172 --> 01:17:49,637
And do not come up here
till I come and get you.

1077
01:17:58,285 --> 01:18:00,104
Come on. Come on. Let's go.

1078
01:18:00,154 --> 01:18:02,452
Come on. It's all right.

1079
01:18:02,556 --> 01:18:05,409
It's gonna be all right.
Go ahead.

1080
01:18:05,459 --> 01:18:06,949
Jolene!

1081
01:18:35,923 --> 01:18:38,357
Frankie? Jimmy?

1082
01:18:43,931 --> 01:18:45,660
Sal?

1083
01:18:49,103 --> 01:18:50,468
She's not here!

1084
01:18:50,638 --> 01:18:52,572
Check the other room!

1085
01:18:59,713 --> 01:19:02,341
<i>Life changes fast.</i>

1086
01:19:02,449 --> 01:19:03,711
<i>Lightning strikes,</i>

1087
01:19:03,817 --> 01:19:07,253
<i>and in an instant,
everything that was...</i>

1088
01:19:07,354 --> 01:19:09,515
<i>is not what is.</i>

1089
01:19:09,623 --> 01:19:11,614
<i>And you find yourself
sitting on a rock</i>

1090
01:19:11,725 --> 01:19:14,353
<i>at the edge of the desert,</i>

1091
01:19:14,461 --> 01:19:19,421
<i>hoping some trucker will come by
and feel sorry for you</i>

1092
01:19:19,533 --> 01:19:23,808
<i>before you're found
lying dead there...</i>

1093
01:19:24,371 --> 01:19:28,364
<i>...like any other piece of road kill.</i>

1094
01:19:41,922 --> 01:19:45,050
<i>Two years later,
I was living in Tulsa.</i>

1095
01:19:45,159 --> 01:19:47,719
<i>I waited tables,
shelved library books,</i>

1096
01:19:47,828 --> 01:19:50,695
<i>and eventually landed a job
as a receptionist</i>

1097
01:19:50,798 --> 01:19:54,418
<i>at a firm that leased
oil-drilling equipment.</i>

1098
01:19:54,468 --> 01:19:56,868
<i>I hadn't been involved
with anyone in a while,</i>

1099
01:19:56,971 --> 01:19:59,356
<i>and it was good for me.</i>

1100
01:19:59,406 --> 01:20:02,541
<i>I was making it on my own.</i>

1101
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:12,275
<i>Finally, I felt I was right
where I was supposed to be.</i>

1102
01:20:14,622 --> 01:20:16,385
Where are you going
in such a hurry?

1103
01:20:16,490 --> 01:20:17,889
Oh, I'm sorry, Peggy.

1104
01:20:17,992 --> 01:20:20,927
I just got a call for a catering gig,
and I cannot turn it down.

1105
01:20:21,028 --> 01:20:22,859
What about happy hour?

1106
01:20:22,963 --> 01:20:24,988
<i>I'll be happier making
a quick hundred bucks.</i>

1107
01:20:25,099 --> 01:20:26,862
We'll do it tomorrow?

1108
01:20:26,967 --> 01:20:29,629
But I wanted to get wasted tonight.

1109
01:20:29,737 --> 01:20:31,534
Be brave. Go solo.

1110
01:20:31,639 --> 01:20:35,914
Hey, maybe you'll meet
the man of your dreams.

1111
01:20:47,888 --> 01:20:50,548
There we go.
Thank you, dear.

1112
01:21:03,804 --> 01:21:05,829
- Hi, Burns.
Oh, hi.

1113
01:21:07,541 --> 01:21:10,271
Just when I thought this party
was a total bust.

1114
01:21:10,377 --> 01:21:11,503
Excuse me?

1115
01:21:11,612 --> 01:21:13,910
Well, you're the first person
under 60 I've seen here all night,

1116
01:21:14,014 --> 01:21:17,108
and by far the prettiest.

1117
01:21:18,619 --> 01:21:21,279
Wait, wait.
Hold on, hold on.

1118
01:21:24,191 --> 01:21:27,041
You can go fill your tray now.

1119
01:21:35,169 --> 01:21:36,594
Not our pastor.

1120
01:21:37,871 --> 01:21:38,895
Asshole.

1121
01:21:40,474 --> 01:21:43,093
You're allowed to talk to me,
you know.

1122
01:21:43,143 --> 01:21:44,701
We're not supposed to talk
to the guests.

1123
01:21:44,812 --> 01:21:46,871
- Thanks, anyway.
- You're welcome.

1124
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:50,000
But I'm actually giving you
permission to talk to me.

1125
01:21:50,050 --> 01:21:51,935
I'll keep that in mind.

1126
01:21:51,985 --> 01:21:56,807
Oh, oh, you... you don't know.
This is my parents' house.

1127
01:21:56,857 --> 01:21:59,042
It's a very nice house.

1128
01:21:59,426 --> 01:22:01,986
Bradley, dear, I have been
looking all over for you.

1129
01:22:02,096 --> 01:22:02,994
There's a young lady

1130
01:22:03,097 --> 01:22:04,655
that your father and I
would like you to meet.

1131
01:22:04,765 --> 01:22:06,426
Not now, Mother.
Tell me your name.

1132
01:22:06,533 --> 01:22:08,433
- Bradley.
- Mother, I'm busy.

1133
01:22:08,535 --> 01:22:10,245
Tell me your name.

1134
01:22:11,338 --> 01:22:12,600
Jolene.

1135
01:22:12,773 --> 01:22:14,570
Jolene.

1136
01:22:14,675 --> 01:22:17,371
Mother, this is Jolene.
Jolene, this is my mother.

1137
01:22:17,478 --> 01:22:22,798
Mother, please give Jolene
your permission to talk to me.

1138
01:22:23,751 --> 01:22:25,651
My name's Brad. Brad Benton.

1139
01:22:25,753 --> 01:22:28,793
<i>I think mother likes you.</i>

1140
01:22:32,993 --> 01:22:36,861
Hmm. Just as I thought.

1141
01:22:36,964 --> 01:22:40,161
Redheads have
their own special scent.

1142
01:22:40,267 --> 01:22:42,929
Kind of like warm milk.

1143
01:22:43,036 --> 01:22:46,096
I've never heard that one before.

1144
01:22:47,441 --> 01:22:49,341
I really have to go.

1145
01:22:55,582 --> 01:22:57,447
She loves me.

1146
01:23:15,469 --> 01:23:19,906
Could you sign right here, Jo-o-lene?

1147
01:23:20,474 --> 01:23:22,192
Wait. Are you sure?

1148
01:23:22,242 --> 01:23:24,142
That's what it says.

1149
01:23:28,749 --> 01:23:30,410
Thank you.

1150
01:23:32,953 --> 01:23:34,181
Who are they from?

1151
01:23:34,288 --> 01:23:35,414
I don't have any idea.

1152
01:23:35,522 --> 01:23:37,456
Well, I can tell you.

1153
01:23:38,625 --> 01:23:42,117
"May I have the honor
of your company for dinner tonight?

1154
01:23:42,229 --> 01:23:46,427
Brad G. Benton, 555-5677."

1155
01:23:46,533 --> 01:23:50,094
Oh, my God.
You know Brad Benton?

1156
01:23:50,204 --> 01:23:51,569
Do you know who he is?

1157
01:23:51,672 --> 01:23:53,537
Mnh-mnh.

1158
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:59,203
Only Brad G. Benton
of Benton International, Inc?

1159
01:23:59,313 --> 01:24:01,440
H- his family owns
this entire building

1160
01:24:01,548 --> 01:24:04,073
and about half of Tulsa.

1161
01:24:04,184 --> 01:24:06,152
Oh.

1162
01:24:06,253 --> 01:24:07,604
<i>That guy.</i>

1163
01:24:07,654 --> 01:24:09,747
He's richer than God.

1164
01:24:09,857 --> 01:24:10,824
Call him.

1165
01:24:12,025 --> 01:24:14,411
Call him now.
I'll call him for you.

1166
01:24:14,461 --> 01:24:16,931
Oh-ho. Peg, take a breath.

1167
01:24:17,931 --> 01:24:19,116
Are you crazy?

1168
01:24:19,166 --> 01:24:21,018
He's a Benton, for God's sake.

1169
01:24:21,068 --> 01:24:23,887
<i>Well, then, you go ahead
and go out with him.</i>

1170
01:24:23,937 --> 01:24:26,456
Jolene, let me tell you something.

1171
01:24:26,506 --> 01:24:29,927
Nobody says "no"
to a Benton around here,

1172
01:24:29,977 --> 01:24:32,462
especially if you want
to keep your job.

1173
01:24:32,512 --> 01:24:37,072
They wouldn't fire me
for not going out with him.

1174
01:25:03,543 --> 01:25:05,306
Uh, bring us a bottle
of your finest Pinot.

1175
01:25:05,412 --> 01:25:07,471
Of course, Mr. Benton.

1176
01:25:07,581 --> 01:25:09,671
You prefer red, right?

1177
01:25:09,983 --> 01:25:11,869
Actually, I like white.

1178
01:25:11,919 --> 01:25:13,409
Liar.

1179
01:25:14,588 --> 01:25:16,139
What do you think of the club?

1180
01:25:16,189 --> 01:25:18,675
It's not my kind of place,
but for what it is, it's nice.

1181
01:25:18,725 --> 01:25:20,488
I figured you might be impressed.

1182
01:25:20,594 --> 01:25:21,788
I hope you are.

1183
01:25:21,895 --> 01:25:25,749
'Cause I'm certainly impressed
with you, Jolene.

1184
01:25:25,799 --> 01:25:26,650
Thank you.

1185
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:28,497
I mean, you just...
you just appear into my life,

1186
01:25:28,602 --> 01:25:30,001
and... bam... here we are
all dressed up,

1187
01:25:30,103 --> 01:25:32,953
discussing our favorite wines.

1188
01:25:34,107 --> 01:25:37,027
Speaking of which,
where is that incompetent waiter?

1189
01:25:37,077 --> 01:25:41,431
He must be new here.
He doesn't know the score yet.

1190
01:25:41,481 --> 01:25:43,856
Did you forget something?

1191
01:25:44,017 --> 01:25:45,279
No, sir. I'm sorry.

1192
01:25:45,385 --> 01:25:48,906
<i>But we have to go into the cellar
to bring the very finest Pinot noir...</i>

1193
01:25:48,956 --> 01:25:51,516
- Uh-huh.
- As you requested.

1194
01:25:54,795 --> 01:25:57,320
Don't be smart with me, understood?

1195
01:25:57,431 --> 01:25:58,625
Yes, sir. Of course.

1196
01:25:58,732 --> 01:26:00,461
- You're new here, right?
- Yes, sir, I am.

1197
01:26:00,567 --> 01:26:02,119
Right. What's...
what's your name?

1198
01:26:02,169 --> 01:26:03,466
Benjamin, sir.

1199
01:26:03,637 --> 01:26:05,002
Benjamin. Benjamin.

1200
01:26:05,105 --> 01:26:07,630
Well, Benjamin, it's really nice
to have you waiting on us.

1201
01:26:07,741 --> 01:26:09,926
Keep up the great work.

1202
01:26:14,681 --> 01:26:17,200
<i>You always this rude?</i>

1203
01:26:17,250 --> 01:26:18,512
No. No, I'm not like that.

1204
01:26:18,618 --> 01:26:19,880
He deserved it.

1205
01:26:19,987 --> 01:26:21,147
I hope I didn't embarrass you,

1206
01:26:21,254 --> 01:26:25,609
but, really, he'll be
a much better waiter now.

1207
01:26:25,659 --> 01:26:28,879
So, Brad, what exactly is it
you do with your life?

1208
01:26:28,929 --> 01:26:32,365
Well, technically, I'm a stockbroker,
but it's just a hobby.

1209
01:26:32,466 --> 01:26:34,718
I never have to work
another day in my life.

1210
01:26:34,768 --> 01:26:37,554
I make truckloads of money,
get paid ridiculous bonuses

1211
01:26:37,604 --> 01:26:41,370
for no other reason than I'm me.

1212
01:26:41,475 --> 01:26:45,295
But forget about me.
Let's talk about you.

1213
01:26:45,345 --> 01:26:46,312
I feel I must tell you,

1214
01:26:46,413 --> 01:26:48,465
you're one of the strangest people
I've ever met.

1215
01:26:48,515 --> 01:26:50,039
No, I'm not.

1216
01:26:50,150 --> 01:26:53,760
I'm actually really
quite a simple guy.

1217
01:26:53,954 --> 01:26:55,512
I hope this isn't inappropriate,

1218
01:26:55,622 --> 01:26:57,522
but have you accepted
our Lord Jesus Christ

1219
01:26:57,624 --> 01:26:59,904
as your personal savior?

1220
01:27:00,127 --> 01:27:02,179
Are you seriously asking me
that question?

1221
01:27:02,229 --> 01:27:04,984
Yeah, I'm absolutely serious.

1222
01:27:05,732 --> 01:27:08,018
<i>That would be my business, Brad.</i>

1223
01:27:08,068 --> 01:27:09,968
Okay.

1224
01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:13,490
I'm sure we can figure it out, then.

1225
01:27:15,709 --> 01:27:17,643
Oh, listen.
I'm sorry I got a little worked up.

1226
01:27:17,744 --> 01:27:19,041
This is our first date,

1227
01:27:19,146 --> 01:27:20,909
and I really wanted everything
to be perfect.

1228
01:27:21,014 --> 01:27:23,133
Uh, I hope I haven't offended you.

1229
01:27:23,183 --> 01:27:26,209
<i>Oh, quite the contrary, sir.
You were right to complain.</i>

1230
01:27:26,319 --> 01:27:27,871
The evening's on the house.

1231
01:27:27,921 --> 01:27:30,321
Hey, thanks, man.
That's really great.

1232
01:27:30,424 --> 01:27:33,654
Write yourself in a big tip, okay?

1233
01:27:36,296 --> 01:27:38,315
I think we're having
an absolutely fantastic time,

1234
01:27:38,365 --> 01:27:39,992
don't you?

1235
01:27:40,867 --> 01:27:43,487
I think you're absolutely crazy.

1236
01:27:43,537 --> 01:27:47,491
Which means you probably
really like me a lot.

1237
01:27:47,541 --> 01:27:49,960
You're not kidding, are you?

1238
01:27:50,010 --> 01:27:51,807
Why don't you figure that out
on our next date?

1239
01:27:51,912 --> 01:27:53,964
Wednesday is great for me.
I hope that works for you.

1240
01:27:54,014 --> 01:27:58,068
Well, I'm gonna have to get back
to you on that.

1241
01:27:58,118 --> 01:28:01,538
I felt blessed the minute I saw you.

1242
01:28:02,022 --> 01:28:04,374
You don't know anything
about me, Brad.

1243
01:28:04,424 --> 01:28:08,699
But I know when my prayers
have been answered.

1244
01:28:09,763 --> 01:28:14,996
<i>At first, I couldn't believe
Brad G. Benton was serious.</i>

1245
01:28:15,102 --> 01:28:19,389
<i>On the other hand,
this was the Bible Belt,</i>

1246
01:28:19,439 --> 01:28:23,524
<i>and I'd met
some very sincere people.</i>

1247
01:28:24,111 --> 01:28:29,014
<i>Though he was a little weird,
Brad was a perfect gentleman.</i>

1248
01:28:29,116 --> 01:28:33,746
<i>He was never inappropriate
and always considerate.</i>

1249
01:28:33,854 --> 01:28:35,719
<i>After a couple more dates,</i>

1250
01:28:35,822 --> 01:28:40,623
<i>I actually started to enjoy
his eccentric personality.</i>

1251
01:28:40,727 --> 01:28:43,719
<i>And he was always
going out of his way</i>

1252
01:28:43,830 --> 01:28:46,870
<i>to show me that he cared.</i>

1253
01:28:49,169 --> 01:28:51,501
Where are you taking me?

1254
01:29:18,431 --> 01:29:21,559
What an amazing view.

1255
01:29:23,170 --> 01:29:26,400
Tulsa's so beautiful from up here.

1256
01:29:27,641 --> 01:29:29,233
About as close to heaven
as you can get

1257
01:29:29,342 --> 01:29:32,175
without leaving Oklahoma.

1258
01:29:56,136 --> 01:29:58,955
Thank you, Brad.
That's very thoughtful.

1259
01:29:59,005 --> 01:30:00,495
You're welcome.

1260
01:30:04,945 --> 01:30:06,730
Are you as happy as I am?

1261
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:07,872
Mm-hmm.

1262
01:30:08,048 --> 01:30:10,414
I hope you'll remember today forever.

1263
01:30:10,517 --> 01:30:13,177
I've got a surprise for you.

1264
01:30:19,025 --> 01:30:20,390
What's this?

1265
01:30:20,493 --> 01:30:24,673
I don't know. Open it.
It's addressed to you.

1266
01:30:29,836 --> 01:30:30,860
I fired you from Benton.

1267
01:30:30,971 --> 01:30:35,721
You'll never have to work
another day of your life.

1268
01:30:35,909 --> 01:30:37,861
But I like my job, Brad.

1269
01:30:37,911 --> 01:30:40,004
You're not seeing
the big picture here.

1270
01:30:40,113 --> 01:30:42,032
You can make your paintings,
you can raise our kids.

1271
01:30:42,082 --> 01:30:44,534
What's wrong with you?
Why the hell would you fire me?

1272
01:30:44,584 --> 01:30:46,677
Jolene, just calm down and listen.

1273
01:30:46,786 --> 01:30:49,414
The Lord told me that one day
I would meet the right person

1274
01:30:49,522 --> 01:30:51,041
to spend the rest of my life with.

1275
01:30:51,091 --> 01:30:54,321
The Lord also tell you to fire me?

1276
01:30:57,430 --> 01:31:01,610
I want you to be
the happiest woman on earth.

1277
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:10,575
Will you marry me?
Please say yes.

1278
01:31:11,111 --> 01:31:12,339
Uh...

1279
01:31:15,782 --> 01:31:19,047
It's not that simple.

1280
01:31:19,152 --> 01:31:21,484
You don't know me.

1281
01:31:21,588 --> 01:31:23,613
I want to tell you about my life
before I met you.

1282
01:31:23,723 --> 01:31:25,775
It's... it's important
you know who I am.

1283
01:31:25,825 --> 01:31:28,123
No. What matters is us,
here and now.

1284
01:31:28,228 --> 01:31:29,058
I know I love you,

1285
01:31:29,162 --> 01:31:31,448
and I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

1286
01:31:31,498 --> 01:31:32,487
But, Brad...

1287
01:31:32,599 --> 01:31:35,385
That's all I ever want
or need to know.

1288
01:31:35,435 --> 01:31:37,596
I don't care where you've been
or what you've done.

1289
01:31:37,704 --> 01:31:40,223
That's the past.
This is our future.

1290
01:31:40,273 --> 01:31:41,433
Yeah.

1291
01:31:41,541 --> 01:31:43,099
You're skipping a lot of steps here,

1292
01:31:43,209 --> 01:31:45,629
like meeting your parents,
moving in together.

1293
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:47,964
Jolene, I am asking you to marry me.

1294
01:31:48,014 --> 01:31:50,676
I understand that.
It's very touching.

1295
01:31:50,784 --> 01:31:53,236
It's just, I can't say yes
unless I know I mean it.

1296
01:31:53,286 --> 01:31:55,720
Of course you need time.
I understand that.

1297
01:31:55,822 --> 01:31:57,414
But we can spend
the rest of our lives

1298
01:31:57,524 --> 01:31:58,875
getting to know each other.

1299
01:31:58,925 --> 01:32:03,413
Why complicate something
as beautiful and simple as our love?

1300
01:32:03,463 --> 01:32:05,795
Jolene, we'll be so happy together.

1301
01:32:05,899 --> 01:32:07,324
I swear to God.

1302
01:32:16,076 --> 01:32:18,561
Uh, this is getting too strange.

1303
01:32:18,611 --> 01:32:20,374
Okay, okay.
Wait, wait, wait.

1304
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:22,243
Listen. I'm sorry.
I know. I know.

1305
01:32:22,349 --> 01:32:24,283
Guys, stop the music!

1306
01:32:24,451 --> 01:32:27,337
Get out of here!
Just go! Leave!

1307
01:32:27,387 --> 01:32:29,855
Now!

1308
01:32:30,023 --> 01:32:31,991
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1309
01:32:32,158 --> 01:32:33,648
Listen to me.

1310
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,278
It's taken me a while to grow up,

1311
01:32:35,328 --> 01:32:37,023
to be ready for something
as special as this.

1312
01:32:37,130 --> 01:32:39,758
You are the first woman
I have ever been in love with,

1313
01:32:39,866 --> 01:32:41,951
and the first
I've ever asked to marry.

1314
01:32:42,001 --> 01:32:43,468
And I know in my heart

1315
01:32:43,570 --> 01:32:45,470
that you will grow to love me
as much as I love you.

1316
01:32:45,572 --> 01:32:48,370
It's so obvious. It's perfect.

1317
01:32:48,475 --> 01:32:53,415
Jolene, I really... I really am
a simple kind of guy.

1318
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:54,764
That's intense.

1319
01:32:54,814 --> 01:32:57,934
Don't fight it. It's bigger
than both of us. Marry me.

1320
01:32:57,984 --> 01:32:58,814
I can't.

1321
01:32:58,918 --> 01:33:02,272
Yes, of course you can.
Together we can do anything.

1322
01:33:02,322 --> 01:33:06,088
Brad, I can't marry you.

1323
01:33:09,195 --> 01:33:09,813
<i># Hallelujah#</i>

1324
01:33:09,863 --> 01:33:11,797
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1325
01:33:11,898 --> 01:33:12,922
You may kiss the bride.

1326
01:33:13,032 --> 01:33:16,072
<i># Hallelujah, hallelujah#</i>

1327
01:33:17,303 --> 01:33:19,271
<i># Hallelujah#</i>

1328
01:33:19,372 --> 01:33:21,169
<i># Hallelujah#</i>

1329
01:33:21,274 --> 01:33:23,333
<i># Hallelujah, hallelujah#</i>

1330
01:33:23,443 --> 01:33:25,809
<i># Hallelujah#</i>

01:33:31,818 --> 01:33:34,013
<i># Hallelujah, hallelujah#</i>

1332
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:36,680
<i># Hallelujah, hallelujah#</i>

1333
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:39,782
Brad, honey,
where are your parents?

1334
01:33:39,893 --> 01:33:41,656
Who cares?

1335
01:33:41,761 --> 01:33:42,785
The Lord's here.

1336
01:33:42,896 --> 01:33:44,727
<i># Hallelujah, hallelujah#</i>

1337
01:33:44,831 --> 01:33:46,856

<i># Halle-luja-a-a-ah#</i>

1341
01:34:34,214 --> 01:34:36,833
No, no, no, no.
Brad, please!

1342
01:34:36,883 --> 01:34:38,874
- No, I don't like it there.
- Jolene, shh, shh, shh!

1343
01:34:38,985 --> 01:34:41,078
No, I don't like it there.

1344
01:34:41,187 --> 01:34:42,654
Aah!

1345
01:34:45,024 --> 01:34:45,924
Ew.

1346
01:34:49,629 --> 01:34:52,792
Ah, this is so fucking beautiful.

1347
01:35:12,919 --> 01:35:15,149
Thank you, Travis.

1348
01:35:23,897 --> 01:35:25,057
Who's that?

1349
01:35:25,231 --> 01:35:27,606
<i>That is my father.</i>

1350
01:35:28,167 --> 01:35:29,327
Your father?

1351
01:35:29,936 --> 01:35:31,904
Mm-hmm.

1352
01:35:32,071 --> 01:35:33,923
Brad, shouldn't we go over there?

1353
01:35:33,973 --> 01:35:37,760
Nah. If he wants to meet you,
he can come here.

1354
01:35:37,810 --> 01:35:40,850
But I want to meet your parents.

1355
01:35:41,281 --> 01:35:43,476
It's a complicated thing.

1356
01:35:43,583 --> 01:35:44,572
Trust me.

1357
01:35:50,223 --> 01:35:53,643
They think if they ignore me,
I'll just go away?

1358
01:35:53,693 --> 01:35:56,546
<i>No. It's not really
about you so much.</i>

1359
01:35:56,596 --> 01:35:59,482
What kind of parents don't show up
for their own son's weddin'?

1360
01:35:59,532 --> 01:36:04,560
Proud, inflexible, arrogant ones,
like those two.

1361
01:36:04,671 --> 01:36:07,426
But they're not all that bad.

1362
01:36:09,742 --> 01:36:15,131
Brad, when we have kids,
I want to love them no matter what.

1363
01:36:15,181 --> 01:36:16,011
Oh, we will, honey.

1364
01:36:16,115 --> 01:36:19,869
We're gonna have a huge family,
all of our own.

1365
01:36:19,919 --> 01:36:22,046
- Brad.
- What?

1366
01:36:28,728 --> 01:36:29,512
Are you...?

1367
01:36:29,562 --> 01:36:31,689
Mm-hmm.

1368
01:36:32,231 --> 01:36:33,129
Really?

1369
01:36:33,299 --> 01:36:34,288
Yeah.

1370
01:36:34,467 --> 01:36:35,593
Hallelujah!

1371
01:36:35,768 --> 01:36:37,420
- I'm gonna be a daddy!
- Oh!

1372
01:36:37,470 --> 01:36:40,769
<i>I knew if I wanted
to prove anything to Brad's family,</i>

1373
01:36:40,873 --> 01:36:44,627
<i>if I wanted any kind
of social acceptance in Tulsa,</i>

1374
01:36:44,677 --> 01:36:46,863
<i>I would have to work for it.</i>

1375
01:36:46,913 --> 01:36:51,646
<i>I embraced their style of life,
their manners,</i>

1376
01:36:51,751 --> 01:36:55,710
<i>their ways of doing things,
and I was patient,</i>

1377
01:36:55,822 --> 01:36:58,256
<i>but always kept
my eyes and ears open.</i>

1378
01:36:58,358 --> 01:36:59,783
Excuse me, son.

1379
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:02,946
It's good to see you.

1380
01:37:02,996 --> 01:37:04,231
You too, Dad.

1381
01:37:04,297 --> 01:37:06,356
Uh, Jolene, honey, this is my father.

1382
01:37:06,466 --> 01:37:08,718
It's a pleasure to finally meet you,
Mr. Benton.

1383
01:37:08,768 --> 01:37:10,235
<i>It's very nice meeting you.</i>

1384
01:37:10,336 --> 01:37:13,305
And I believe
you remember my mother.

1385
01:37:13,406 --> 01:37:17,111
It's nice to see you again,
Mrs. Benton.

1386
01:37:18,311 --> 01:37:20,763
- So, the baby's due any day now.
- Mm-hmm.

1387
01:37:20,813 --> 01:37:22,732
Is it a boy or a girl?

1388
01:37:22,782 --> 01:37:25,546
A boy.

1389
01:37:34,427 --> 01:37:35,724
- Jolene.
- Hmm?

1390
01:37:35,828 --> 01:37:37,318
Wake up.

1391
01:37:37,430 --> 01:37:38,362
What?

1392
01:37:38,464 --> 01:37:39,556
Wake up.

1393
01:37:39,666 --> 01:37:40,950
Brad, are you all right?

1394
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:44,800
You've slept with other men,
haven't you?

1395
01:37:46,472 --> 01:37:48,992
What are you talking about?
Why are you asking me this?

1396
01:37:49,042 --> 01:37:52,562
<i>It's just something that's
been bothering me a lot lately.</i>

1397
01:37:52,612 --> 01:37:55,911
But when we first met,
you said that it didn't matter.

1398
01:37:56,015 --> 01:37:58,540
Babe, you were right.

1399
01:37:58,651 --> 01:38:02,178
I tried to tell you,
but you wouldn't listen.

1400
01:38:02,288 --> 01:38:04,641
Why are you interested
all of a sudden?

1401
01:38:04,691 --> 01:38:05,908
Just... just answer the question.

1402
01:38:05,958 --> 01:38:07,644
No. Not until you answer mine.

1403
01:38:07,694 --> 01:38:08,786
How many?

1404
01:38:09,629 --> 01:38:11,414
Are you kidding me?
You want a number?

1405
01:38:11,464 --> 01:38:12,522
How many?!

1406
01:38:12,699 --> 01:38:16,586
You have no right to ask me that
without an explanation.

1407
01:38:16,636 --> 01:38:18,900
There have been that many?

1408
01:38:19,005 --> 01:38:19,905
Wow.

1409
01:38:21,340 --> 01:38:25,900
Brad, you knew I wasn't a virgin
when we married.

1410
01:38:26,412 --> 01:38:29,506
You see, Jolene, it's easy for me.
I can count mine on one hand.

1411
01:38:29,615 --> 01:38:32,277
Now, if you had been with one guy
or maybe even two guys,

1412
01:38:32,385 --> 01:38:34,148
ah, that's the kind of thing
you wouldn't forget.

1413
01:38:34,253 --> 01:38:36,585
<i>But if you'd been with a lot of guys,</i>

1414
01:38:36,689 --> 01:38:39,642
then I guess it gets kind of hard
to keep track of that, right?

1415
01:38:39,692 --> 01:38:40,920
So, what are you saying,

1416
01:38:41,027 --> 01:38:44,542
that five is okay
but six is too many?

1417
01:38:45,264 --> 01:38:47,050
How many have there been?

1418
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:49,719
Sweetheart, please,
let's just go back to sleep.

1419
01:38:49,769 --> 01:38:50,599
10?

1420
01:38:50,770 --> 01:38:53,603
Brad, please.

1421
01:38:53,706 --> 01:38:56,159
I never loved anybody more
than the way that I love you.

1422
01:38:56,209 --> 01:38:57,369
20, 30, 50?

1423
01:38:57,477 --> 01:39:01,277
Hundreds! Thousands!
Do you feel better?!

1424
01:39:03,616 --> 01:39:07,837
<i>Never mind that I had tried
to tell Brad about my marriages,</i>

1425
01:39:07,887 --> 01:39:10,856
<i>my life on the road...</i>

1426
01:39:10,957 --> 01:39:14,187
<i>he never wanted to hear it.</i>

1427
01:39:15,561 --> 01:39:17,927
Brad, honey?

1428
01:39:23,736 --> 01:39:28,201
I just don't know where all this
is coming from.

1429
01:39:33,980 --> 01:39:36,505
I have nothing to hide.

1430
01:39:37,683 --> 01:39:39,602
If it's that important to you,

1431
01:39:39,652 --> 01:39:40,744
of course...

1432
01:39:41,187 --> 01:39:42,552
Ohh!

1433
01:39:50,396 --> 01:39:55,698
Dear Lord, please bless our family...

1434
01:39:55,802 --> 01:39:58,566
for we have sinned.

1435
01:40:02,275 --> 01:40:04,800
I hurt my wife...

1436
01:40:05,344 --> 01:40:08,108
because she hurt me.

1437
01:40:12,552 --> 01:40:17,682
Sweetheart, I love you more
than anything in the world.

1438
01:40:17,957 --> 01:40:24,886
I will never ever do anything
to hurt you ever again.

1439
01:40:31,137 --> 01:40:34,903
Lord, please, please forgive us.

1440
01:40:43,049 --> 01:40:45,501
<i>It was as if his wildness,</i>

1441
01:40:45,551 --> 01:40:48,019
<i>his independence,</i>

1442
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:53,915
<i>his personality was being driven
from the Brad I loved.</i>

1443
01:41:34,767 --> 01:41:41,132
<i>For the very first time in my life,
I had something I wanted.</i>

1444
01:41:41,574 --> 01:41:43,872
<i>I was Jolene...</i>

1445
01:41:44,043 --> 01:41:46,443
<i>his mother.</i>

1446
01:41:47,179 --> 01:41:50,789
<i>And I could believe in God now.</i>

1447
01:41:57,323 --> 01:42:00,588
What shall we eat?
I know.

1448
01:42:18,878 --> 01:42:22,245
<i>It was those parents of his
gradually absorbing him</i>

1449
01:42:22,348 --> 01:42:25,534
<i>back into their righteousness.</i>

1450
01:42:25,584 --> 01:42:26,983
Jolene, can you feed him
in the nursery

1451
01:42:27,086 --> 01:42:28,075
or let him go to the nurse?

1452
01:42:28,187 --> 01:42:31,020
- How am I supposed to eat?
- Brad, he was hungry.

1453
01:42:31,123 --> 01:42:33,943
- I'm trying to get him to go to sleep.
- Where the hell is Rosie?

1454
01:42:33,993 --> 01:42:36,120
- We gave her the day off.
- Well, let's get her back.

1455
01:42:36,228 --> 01:42:38,128
We need her to take care
of junior today.

1456
01:42:38,230 --> 01:42:41,083
Grandpa and grandma are coming
to see Mr. Nipplebee today.

1457
01:42:41,133 --> 01:42:43,124
You need to make yourself
presentable.

1458
01:42:43,235 --> 01:42:45,635
What, they're coming today?!

1459
01:42:45,738 --> 01:42:47,456
For lunch.
And to see the Bradley.

1460
01:42:47,506 --> 01:42:49,565
Brad! Why didn't you tell me?

1461
01:42:49,675 --> 01:42:51,827
This place has to be cleaned!

1462
01:42:51,877 --> 01:42:52,673
They just called.

1463
01:42:52,778 --> 01:42:54,530
What was I supposed to say,
that we weren't here?

1464
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:56,399
Look, I can't see them today.
I've got too much to do.

1465
01:42:56,449 --> 01:43:01,804
That's okay. They probably don't want
to deal with you anyway.

1466
01:43:01,854 --> 01:43:04,073
That's the truth, isn't it?

1467
01:43:04,123 --> 01:43:07,828
Of course it is.
Don't act so surprised.

1468
01:43:07,927 --> 01:43:11,537
Jolene, save the drama
for another day.

1469
01:43:45,698 --> 01:43:47,408
You fucking whore!

1470
01:43:47,767 --> 01:43:48,859
Brad! No!

1471
01:44:22,802 --> 01:44:24,235
Oh, my God!

1472
01:44:24,336 --> 01:44:26,521
Mrs. Benton! Oh, my...!

1473
01:44:28,707 --> 01:44:31,160
Oh, God, what did he do to you?!

1474
01:44:31,210 --> 01:44:32,110
Oh!

1475
01:44:34,413 --> 01:44:36,883
Mrs. Benton, are you okay?

1476
01:45:07,913 --> 01:45:11,007
Aw. Shh.

1477
01:45:13,853 --> 01:45:18,187
<i>The nurse at the hospital
didn't need to ask how it happened.</i>

1478
01:45:18,290 --> 01:45:21,453
Shh. Come on.

1479
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:25,963
<i>She wrote out the name and address
of a women's shelter,</i>

1480
01:45:26,065 --> 01:45:29,752
<i>and the shelter gave me
the name of a lawyer.</i>

1481
01:45:29,802 --> 01:45:33,829
He's a dangerous man.
I can't have him in my life.

1482
01:45:33,939 --> 01:45:37,593
I don't care about the money.
I just want out.

1483
01:45:37,643 --> 01:45:39,474
I'm afraid I'm...

1484
01:45:39,578 --> 01:45:43,732
<i>not going to be able to help you,
Mrs. Benton.</i>

1485
01:45:43,782 --> 01:45:44,800
What do you mean?

1486
01:45:44,850 --> 01:45:47,700
I mean I can't take your case.

1487
01:45:48,053 --> 01:45:49,247
Why?

1488
01:45:52,024 --> 01:45:54,710
Did his family threaten you
or just buy you off?

1489
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:59,035
This has nothing to do
with the Benton family.

1490
01:45:59,498 --> 01:46:01,762
He beat me. It's simple.

1491
01:46:01,867 --> 01:46:03,892
<i>I'm afraid it's not that simple.</i>

1492
01:46:04,003 --> 01:46:05,493
You didn't tell me you had a past,

1493
01:46:05,604 --> 01:46:07,697
including a stretch
in juvenile detention.

1494
01:46:07,806 --> 01:46:08,795
That was a long time ago.

1495
01:46:08,908 --> 01:46:11,308
To say nothing of a previous
as yet un-annulled marriage

1496
01:46:11,410 --> 01:46:14,868
to a convicted drug dealer.

1497
01:46:14,980 --> 01:46:16,880
You entered into your marriage
with Mr. Benton

1498
01:46:16,982 --> 01:46:20,941
under less than honest
circumstances.

1499
01:46:21,954 --> 01:46:23,478
I'm very sorry.

1500
01:46:23,589 --> 01:46:27,294
No one at this firm
will take your case.

1501
01:46:33,699 --> 01:46:35,394
Oh, my darlin'.

1502
01:46:37,303 --> 01:46:39,362
Uh, Mrs. Benton.

1503
01:46:39,471 --> 01:46:41,132
There's some people here
to see you!

1504
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:42,832
Come on. Come on.

1505
01:46:42,942 --> 01:46:46,207
Oh! Look at you. Yes.

1506
01:46:50,716 --> 01:46:52,377
What? No, where are you going?
Wait! Stop!

1507
01:46:52,484 --> 01:46:54,918
You... you are under arrest

1508
01:46:55,087 --> 01:46:57,351
for the kidnapping
of Bradley Benton junior!

1509
01:46:57,456 --> 01:47:00,721
- No! No! No!
- Come quietly.

1510
01:47:12,771 --> 01:47:14,671
Come on, lady, move.

1511
01:47:15,975 --> 01:47:17,943
No!

1512
01:47:30,656 --> 01:47:32,749
I know that you feel
like you've been wronged, but...

1513
01:47:32,858 --> 01:47:35,344
Wronged? They took my child.

1514
01:47:35,394 --> 01:47:39,831
Unfortunately, Mrs. Benton,
they have a really solid case.

1515
01:47:39,932 --> 01:47:41,917
I mean, the law clearly states...

1516
01:47:41,967 --> 01:47:43,696
Fuck the law!
No one's taking my child!

1517
01:47:43,802 --> 01:47:45,187
Do you understand that?

1518
01:47:45,237 --> 01:47:48,434
Mrs. Benton, I'm gonna work
really hard on your case.

1519
01:47:48,540 --> 01:47:49,404
I promise.

1520
01:47:50,075 --> 01:47:53,101
<i>The legal aid guy
was way out of his league,</i>

1521
01:47:53,212 --> 01:47:55,976
<i>and, without giving it
a second thought,</i>

1522
01:47:56,081 --> 01:47:59,346
<i>the judge ruled
that I was an unfit mother</i>

1523
01:47:59,451 --> 01:48:04,946
<i>and granted Brad sole custody
of my little boy.</i>

1524
01:48:05,057 --> 01:48:07,150
I mean, you do have
a checkered past.

1525
01:48:07,259 --> 01:48:08,783
<i>I had choices.</i>

1526
01:48:08,894 --> 01:48:10,589
I think you should hope
for the best, but...

1527
01:48:10,696 --> 01:48:13,927
<i>I could kill Brad G. Benton,</i>

1528
01:48:14,033 --> 01:48:18,197
<i>but then my child would be raised
by the Benton family.</i>

1529
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:19,464
<i>I could find a job</i>

1530
01:48:19,571 --> 01:48:22,631
<i>and see my baby
every second Sunday for one hour,</i>

1531
01:48:22,741 --> 01:48:25,403
<i>as allowed by the judge,</i>

1532
01:48:25,511 --> 01:48:29,865
<i>and find the right moment
to steal him back.</i>

1533
01:48:29,915 --> 01:48:31,041
<i>Or I could let him grow up</i>

1534
01:48:31,150 --> 01:48:36,144
<i>thinking I was something other
than an embarrassment,</i>

1535
01:48:36,255 --> 01:48:38,883
<i>a poor relation...</i>

1536
01:48:40,592 --> 01:48:43,152
<i>...or a victim.</i>

1537
01:49:17,896 --> 01:49:22,456
<i>He could daydream
about his real mother...</i>

1538
01:49:24,336 --> 01:49:28,041
<i>...living somewhere out there...</i>

1539
01:49:30,576 --> 01:49:33,272
<i>...away for a time...</i>

1540
01:49:34,246 --> 01:49:37,738
<i>...but never forgotten.</i>

1541
01:49:42,087 --> 01:49:45,022
<i>She'd be beautiful...</i>

1542
01:49:47,159 --> 01:49:50,253
<i>...smart...</i>

1543
01:49:51,330 --> 01:49:57,125
<i>...and more talented
than she could possibly ever be...</i>

1544
01:49:58,470 --> 01:50:01,415
<i>But so real to my boy...</i>

1545
01:50:04,343 --> 01:50:06,971
<i>My baby boy...</i>

1546
01:50:11,083 --> 01:50:13,449
<i>My son.</i>

1547
01:50:34,039 --> 01:50:38,169
<i>These days, I have a job illustrating
for a small comic-book company.</i>

1548
01:50:38,277 --> 01:50:40,370
<i>Except they don't call them
comic books.</i>

1549
01:50:40,479 --> 01:50:42,379
<i>They call them graphic novels.</i>

1550
01:50:42,481 --> 01:50:45,211
<i>Because most of them
aren't funny at all.</i>

1551
01:50:45,317 --> 01:50:47,012
<i>They're very serious.</i>

1552
01:50:47,119 --> 01:50:49,280
The guys are gonna flip.

1553
01:50:49,455 --> 01:50:51,980
These are wonderful, Jolene!

1554
01:50:52,157 --> 01:50:54,743
Someone once told me
to draw what you know best.

1555
01:50:54,793 --> 01:50:56,192
Good advice...

1556
01:50:56,295 --> 01:50:57,227
I think.

1557
01:50:59,198 --> 01:51:01,496
Well, I'm out of here.

1558
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:03,452
Meet you before work tomorrow?

1559
01:51:03,502 --> 01:51:05,487
Farmers' market? Usual time?

1560
01:51:05,537 --> 01:51:07,342
Sounds great, Maya.

1561
01:51:44,810 --> 01:51:47,904
<i>Some people tell me
that I could act in movies,</i>

1562
01:51:48,013 --> 01:51:52,780
<i>because even though I'm 25,
I look a lot younger.</i>

1563
01:51:52,885 --> 01:51:59,345
<i>And they like my voice that I have,
courtesy of my ex-husband.</i>

1564
01:52:03,862 --> 01:52:07,889
