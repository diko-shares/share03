1
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:09,375
My mommy always said
there were no monsters.

2
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:11,753
No real ones.

3
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:15,757
But there are.

4
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:24,349
She's perfect.

5
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:55,004
Careful.

6
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:57,548
Two centimeters.

7
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:02,095
Okay. Okay.

8
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,974
Yeah. Ready with that amnio.

9
00:05:11,938 --> 00:05:13,398
And...

10
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:20,029
...there it is.

11
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:37,672
But be careful.

12
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,055
Jesus.

13
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:51,519
Clamp.

14
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:56,232
What about her? Can we keep her alive?

15
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,234
How's the host?

16
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:02,071
Doing well.

17
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,160
Sew her back up.

18
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,958
Excellent work. Everybody.

19
00:07:55,935 --> 00:08:01,274
- How is our Number Eight today?
- Appears to be in good health.

20
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,317
- How good?
- Excellent.

21
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:07,905
As in completely off our projected charts.

22
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:10,575
Look at the scar tissue.

23
00:08:13,578 --> 00:08:15,496
See the recession?

24
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:18,583
- This is from three days ago?
- Exactly.

25
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,793
Well, this is good.

26
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,171
This is very good.

27
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:28,801
You're gonna make us all very proud.

28
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:45,318
No.

29
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:48,112
Don't! I'm all right!

30
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:51,532
Now try this.

31
00:08:58,581 --> 00:09:01,250
- Hand.
- Close.

32
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:03,294
Glove.

33
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:15,681
Number Eight?

34
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:18,809
- Fruit.
- Good, cherries.

35
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:21,812
- It's unprecedented.
- Totally.

36
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:26,901
She's operating at
a completely adult capacity.

37
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:31,572
- What about her memories?
- There are gaps.

38
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:34,909
- Some degree of synaptic dissonance.
- You know this.

39
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:36,869
She's freaked.

40
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:40,206
It has connective difficulties,
caused by a biochemical imbalance...

41
00:09:40,373 --> 00:09:42,792
...causing emotional autism.
Certain reactions--

42
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,419
Wait a second. It has memories.

43
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:47,672
Why does it have memories?

44
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:50,508
Well, I'm guessing,
but inherited memories...

45
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:54,762
...passed down generationally at a genetic
level by the aliens, like its strength.

46
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:59,517
Plus a highly evolved form of instinct.

47
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:03,980
An unexpected benefit
from the genetic crossing.

48
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:08,609
Oh, I see. Well, of course.
Stupid me. Of course.

49
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:14,115
An unexpected benefit of the genetic
process! I didn't even think of that.

50
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:18,035
Let's try this one.

51
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:23,499
Ripley?

52
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:27,211
Ripley?

53
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:31,257
Ripley, what is it?

54
00:10:33,384 --> 00:10:36,304
Ripley? Ripley?

55
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:44,437
- You're not thinking termination?
- Oh, boy, am I thinking termination.

56
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,731
We do not perceive this to be a problem.

57
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:49,525
Ellen Ripley died
trying to wipe this species out.

58
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:51,902
For all intents and purposes,
she succeeded.

59
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:54,613
I'm not anxious to see her
taking up her old hobbies.

60
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,074
- That won't happen.
- We won't tell her.

61
00:10:57,241 --> 00:11:00,828
Oh, I see.
And that's supposed to comfort me.

62
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:05,166
Identification, please.

63
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:10,379
Please try again.

64
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:12,798
Thank you, General Perez.

65
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:18,054
The bottom line is, she looks at me funny
one time, I'm putting her down.

66
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,681
Okay, as far as I'm concerned,
Number Eight...

67
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:24,852
...is a meat byproduct.

68
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:30,649
Her Majesty here is the real payoff.

69
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:33,319
- When does she start producing?
- Days.

70
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:35,279
Less, maybe.

71
00:11:35,446 --> 00:11:39,408
- We need the cargo.
- I told you, it's on its way.

72
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:19,657
Fork.

73
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:23,744
- Fuck.
- It's "fork."

74
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,000
How did you...?

75
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:33,754
How did we get you?

76
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:36,340
Yes.

77
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:45,516
Hard work. We used blood samples
from Fiori 16, on ice.

78
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:47,643
Where you died.

79
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:51,647
We've remade you. We cloned you.

80
00:12:51,856 --> 00:12:54,108
Fiori 16.

81
00:12:56,277 --> 00:12:58,779
Does that ring a bell?

82
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:02,074
Are you remembering something?

83
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:05,202
Does it grow?

84
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:09,290
Yeah. Very rapidly.

85
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:14,712
- It's a queen.
- How did you know that?

86
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:18,466
She'll breed.

87
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,509
You'll die.

88
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:23,179
Everyone in the company will die.

89
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,055
"In the company"?

90
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:29,685
Weyland-Yutani.
Ripley Eight's former employers.

91
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:35,274
A Terran Growth conglomerate. They
had defense contracts under the military.

92
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:39,195
Oh, they went under decades ago, Gediman.
Way before your time.

93
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,989
Bought out by Wal-Mart.

94
00:13:42,907 --> 00:13:45,201
Fortunes of war.

95
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:52,041
I think you will find that things have
changed a great deal since your time.

96
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,543
I doubt that.

97
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,462
We're not flying blind here, you know.

98
00:13:56,629 --> 00:14:00,549
This is United Systems Military,
not some greedy corporation.

99
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,262
Well, it won't make any difference.

100
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:08,766
You're still gonna die.

101
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,895
How do you feel about that?

102
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:20,319
I wish you could understand
what we're trying to do.

103
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:24,073
The potential for this species
goes way beyond urban pacification:

104
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,534
New alloys, new vaccines.

105
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,286
Nothing like this we've ever seen
on any world before.

106
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:31,914
You should be very proud.

107
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,543
I am.

108
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,212
And the animal itself:

109
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:40,422
Wondrous.

110
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:44,843
The potential, unbelievable.
Once we've tamed him.

111
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:49,515
Roll over? Play dead?

112
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:51,350
Heel?

113
00:14:51,976 --> 00:14:54,061
You can't teach it tricks.

114
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:58,065
Why not? We're teaching you.

115
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:17,501
Hey, son, I'll give you
my authorization code.

116
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:20,963
It's E-A-T-M-E.

117
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,549
I'm sorry, sir, could you repeat that?

118
00:15:23,716 --> 00:15:25,884
Little prick.

119
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:29,638
You know, no matter
how many times you see it...

120
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:34,685
...the sight of a woman all strapped up
in a chair like that just...

121
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:38,772
What?

122
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:42,359
Just bring us in on a 3-0 descent,
would you? And ride the parallel.

123
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:45,821
- Darling, it is done.
- Good girl.

124
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:50,284
You want anything there, trigger?

125
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,786
Yeah. How about a cup of coffee?

126
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:56,040
Anything else while your mouth's warm,
I mean?

127
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,334
A little milk.

128
00:16:00,753 --> 00:16:05,591
Hey, don't cut thrust till about 600 meters.
We'll give them a little scare.

129
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,384
Vriess! Call!

130
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:10,346
Batten down, we're gonna dock.

131
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,747
- Hey, Call?
- Yeah?

132
00:16:37,665 --> 00:16:41,043
What has two thumbs, one eye...

133
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,755
...a pink tongue...

134
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:48,258
...and screws like a god?

135
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,595
What?

136
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:02,439
Two thumbs, one eye, a pink tongue...

137
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:06,193
...and screws like a god?

138
00:17:08,112 --> 00:17:09,196
What?

139
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:29,133
Time to enjoy some of
the general's hospitality, Christie.

140
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,343
Great. Army food.

141
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:35,347
Yeah, it'll do till we get
the family wagon up to spec, I reckon.

142
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:36,807
Yeah.

143
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:40,102
That is, if the natives are friendly.

144
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:43,480
- How's that?
- Good.

145
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:46,525
Are we expecting any trouble?

146
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:50,696
From Perez, I doubt it. But you
never know, we've been there before.

147
00:18:05,753 --> 00:18:08,380
What is wrong with you?

148
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:11,175
Just a little target practice.

149
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:14,136
Vriess isn't complaining.

150
00:18:16,472 --> 00:18:18,640
Goddamn it.

151
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:20,768
Johner, you son of a bitch!

152
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:24,104
Come on, man, you didn't feel a thing.

153
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:32,446
You are an inbred motherfucker,
you know that?

154
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:39,453
I'll take the knife back now.

155
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:48,879
Call, forget it.

156
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:52,299
He's been sucking down
too much home-brew.

157
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:56,386
The knife.

158
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:01,350
Son of a bitch!

159
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:06,104
Don't push me, Call.
You hang with us for a while...

160
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:10,150
...you'll find out I am not the man
with whom to fuck.

161
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:24,456
It's about time we started associating
with a better class of people.

162
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,713
I am Father.

163
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,674
Welcome to the USM <i>Auriga.</i>

164
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:19,428
Step forward for contraband
and weapons search.

165
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:24,308
Please report any infectious diseases
to the medical officers.

166
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:28,645
Levels 7 through 1 <i>2</i>
are off-limits to civilians.

167
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:31,565
Thank you for your cooperation.

168
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:33,442
Go.

169
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:38,780
- Get your hands up, please, sir.
- What?

170
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,909
Could you get your hands up, please?

171
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:53,629
There are no weapons
allowed onboard, sir.

172
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,507
My own recipe.

173
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,886
Way more dangerous.

174
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:07,893
Nice welcome, Perez.
What the hell is this?

175
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,521
Are you afraid the six of us are gonna
hijack your damn ship or what?

176
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:14,942
Just the minor concern that
one of your asshole crew members...

177
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:19,905
...is gonna get drunk and put a bullet
through the hull. We happen to be in space.

178
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:21,615
No shit.

179
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:23,492
How you been?

180
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,710
Wanna check the chair?

181
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,344
Elgyn, these were very, very hard
to come by.

182
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:44,471
So was our cargo.

183
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,392
You're not about to plead poverty on me,
are you, general?

184
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:51,728
No. I'm just saying,
very few people deal in cash nowadays.

185
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:56,608
Just the ones don't like to keep
business records. Yourself, for example.

186
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:59,945
- Drink, Elgyn?
- Constantly.

187
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:08,203
I'm gonna take a wild guess here, general,
but I'm thinking...

188
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:15,043
...whatever you got going on here,
it ain't exactly approved by Congress.

189
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:20,966
Who's the new filly
you got onboard, Elgyn?

190
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:22,509
Call?

191
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:25,262
Little girl playing pirates?

192
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:27,681
She makes an impression.

193
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:31,643
She is severely fuckable, ain't she?

194
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:42,070
Mighty handy with a monkey wrench too,
I might add.

195
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:45,699
I think Vriess has got
a bit of a light in his eye for her.

196
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:50,579
Fine little ass like that make a man walk,
you know what I mean?

197
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:59,796
Mind you, I think she's just a tad curious
about this little transaction of ours.

198
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:04,634
I mean, I can't say as I blame her.
It's awfully cloak-and-dagger stuff.

199
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:08,472
It's a military operation.

200
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:10,265
Really?

201
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:15,645
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but I was under the impression that...

202
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:20,233
...most army medical labs don't have to
operate outside of regulated space.

203
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,819
What do you want, Elgyn?
What can I do for you?

204
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:24,821
- Me?
- Yeah.

205
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:27,032
Two days' bed and board.

206
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:29,367
Vriess might wanna snag a part
here or there.

207
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:32,204
Whatever. I mean, if it's not imposing.

208
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:35,165
I don't see any problem.

209
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:38,752
- A couple of conditions, though.
- Conditions.

210
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:45,258
Not you, nor any of your...

211
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:47,594
...formidable crew members...

212
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:51,932
...will go anywhere near restricted areas.

213
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:54,684
Rule number two:

214
00:23:56,353 --> 00:24:00,273
- No trouble. Good behavior.
- Good behavior.

215
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:03,068
- No fights.
- No fights?

216
00:24:03,235 --> 00:24:06,822
- No fights.
- No fights.

217
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:39,521
Please direct cargo to medlab center,
Area G.

218
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:43,024
Follow the lit path.

219
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:45,569
Do not deviate.

220
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:58,999
Cargo status stable.

221
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,751
Life forms intact.

222
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:04,546
Stasis uninterrupted.

223
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:21,438
Medlab center is off-limits to civilians.

224
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:23,523
Thank you.

225
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:38,098
- Hey.
- Oh, please.

226
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:40,141
You know I can't lay off the tall ones.

227
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,935
How you doing?

228
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:45,522
How about a little one-on-one?
What do you say?

229
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:53,279
You got some moves on you, girl.

230
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:56,366
Man.

231
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:21,641
You know, if you don't wanna play
basketball, I know some other indoor sports.

232
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:36,322
Come on, now, give me the ball.

233
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:50,420
Okay. I got a new game.

234
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:52,589
Tag.

235
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:08,313
Ripley!

236
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,689
Ripley.

237
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:18,364
You've had enough fun.

238
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:24,037
What the hell are you?

239
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:36,341
Something of a predator, isn't she?

240
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:40,512
Yes, she continues
to make us all very proud.

241
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:58,798
We're coming up on
just one minute and 30 seconds left...

242
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:01,342
...to order this one-of-a-kind
collector's item.

243
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:06,306
Jesus Christ, Johner,
what did you put in this shit? Battery acid?

244
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:08,641
Just for color.

245
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:19,439
So, we're a fast learner.

246
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:22,650
- Now here's a fine item...
- This is a really good show, man.

247
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:25,778
It's from the Gut Cutters
Celebration Collection...

248
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:28,531
...makers of premiere knives
and edge wear.

249
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:31,617
The knife has a stainless-steel blade...

250
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:34,912
...perfect for any use.

251
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:40,960
The handle is made from authentic
antique plywood and stained in...

252
00:32:41,586 --> 00:32:45,131
Woman, that shit is not easy to come by!

253
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:47,967
Why don't you take a walk outside?

254
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:56,476
- Great!
- I'm so sorry.

255
00:32:56,642 --> 00:33:01,481
Shit, if bitches can't handle this shit,
bitches should stay away from this shit!

256
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,358
Fucking bitch.

257
00:33:27,298 --> 00:33:29,884
Identification, please.

258
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:37,183
Please try again.

259
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:43,398
Please try again.

260
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:49,153
Thank you, General Perez.

261
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:25,398
Well?

262
00:34:28,234 --> 00:34:30,069
Are you gonna kill me, or what?

263
00:34:32,697 --> 00:34:34,740
There's no point, is there?

264
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:37,076
They've taken it out of you.

265
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:40,413
Where is it? Is it on the ship?

266
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:44,417
You mean my baby?

267
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:51,257
I don't get it. If they took it out,
why are they keeping you alive?

268
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:55,553
Well, they're curious. I'm the latest thing.

269
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:08,274
Look, I can make it all stop.

270
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:12,445
The pain, this nightmare.
That's all I can offer you.

271
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:25,374
What makes you think
I would let you do that?

272
00:35:29,337 --> 00:35:31,130
Who are you?

273
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:34,759
Ripley, Ellen. Lieutenant first class.

274
00:35:34,926 --> 00:35:37,929
Number 36706.

275
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:42,558
Ellen Ripley died 200 years ago.

276
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:45,144
You're not her.

277
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:49,690
I'm not her?

278
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,284
- Who am I?
- You're a thing, a construct.

279
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:03,412
They grew you in a fucking lab.

280
00:36:03,955 --> 00:36:06,541
And now they brought it out of you.

281
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:08,876
Not all the way out.

282
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,343
I can feel it.

283
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:20,221
Behind my eyes.

284
00:36:20,388 --> 00:36:22,932
I can hear it moving.

285
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:29,397
You gotta help me stop this thing
before it gets loose.

286
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:35,695
It's too late.

287
00:36:35,987 --> 00:36:38,447
You can't stop it.

288
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:40,700
It's inevitable.

289
00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:46,455
Not as long as I'm around.

290
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:49,000
You'll never get out of here alive.

291
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:52,753
I don't care.

292
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,714
Really?

293
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,635
I can make it stop.

294
00:37:06,225 --> 00:37:09,145
Go on, get out of here.

295
00:37:09,312 --> 00:37:11,439
They're looking for you.

296
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,164
I think you're gonna find that this was
very ill-advised. Where are her friends?

297
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:32,877
- They're in the mess hall, sir.
- Well, you find them now. Quietly.

298
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:37,840
- What the hell is going on here?
- It smells like a double-cross, boss.

299
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:42,094
Where's the other one? With the chair?

300
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:45,473
Don't ever touch me. Ever!

301
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:47,683
Wanna tell us what this is?

302
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,935
- Wanna tell me who you're working for?
- What?

303
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:53,314
- Wren, they got nothing to do with this.
- To do with what?

304
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:56,359
Do you know what the penalties
for terrorist activity are?

305
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:59,487
No terrorists in my crew.
Call, something you wanna tell me?

306
00:37:59,654 --> 00:38:04,241
I don't care whether you knew or not. You
brought a terrorist onboard a military vessel.

307
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:07,662
And as far as I am concerned,
you all die with her.

308
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:11,999
Do you understand?

309
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:16,170
Yeah.

310
00:38:16,337 --> 00:38:18,297
I understand.

311
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:22,093
Christie.

312
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:31,852
Freeze!

313
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:42,405
Stop! Drop your weapons!

314
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:46,325
And you, drop that piece of shit!
Or I blow his head off!

315
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:48,828
- I can't do that, man.
- Drop it now!

316
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:51,414
- Can't, they're attached.
- I'm not fucking with you!

317
00:38:51,622 --> 00:38:54,792
You're all under arrest for a Code 8,
which is concealed weapons...

318
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:57,837
...and a Code 1 <i>2,</i> which is murder.
Release Dr.--

319
00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:00,005
- Kiss my ass.
- Put down your weapons!

320
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:08,389
Everybody okay?

321
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:14,019
Real easy, soldier boy.

322
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:19,024
Security, there is a serious problem
in the mess hall.

323
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:21,861
You lie to me now, little girl...

324
00:39:23,654 --> 00:39:26,615
...l will cut your throat and
leave you here to die. Understand?

325
00:39:26,824 --> 00:39:28,492
- This is Security, Section <i>2.</i>
- Hello?

326
00:39:28,659 --> 00:39:30,327
- We do not read you.
- Goddamn. Hello?

327
00:39:30,494 --> 00:39:33,330
- We do not copy you. Please repeat.
- Hello?

328
00:39:33,497 --> 00:39:34,540
Please repeat.

329
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:10,636
Gediman!

330
00:41:10,803 --> 00:41:13,514
He's conducting illegal experiments,
breeding...

331
00:41:13,681 --> 00:41:18,561
- Ice the goddamn mole.
- Listen, he is breeding an alien species.

332
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:21,772
Dangerous. If it gets loose,
it'll make the Lacerta plague...

333
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:24,984
-...look like a fucking square dance.
- Shut up!

334
00:41:27,653 --> 00:41:28,863
Listen.

335
00:41:30,531 --> 00:41:33,617
Your attention, please. Security breach.

336
00:41:33,784 --> 00:41:36,328
Medlab, Level 15.

337
00:42:30,633 --> 00:42:34,303
Let's get back to the <i>Betty.</i> The doctor
and soldier boy can see us to the door.

338
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,597
- What about Vriess?
- Fuck Vriess.

339
00:42:47,775 --> 00:42:49,735
Your attention, please.

340
00:42:49,902 --> 00:42:53,113
Unauthorized opening of Cage 3.

...7, 8, 10.

343
00:43:00,496 --> 00:43:02,706
- Move it! Now!
- Evacuation.

344
00:43:02,873 --> 00:43:05,793
- Go! Go! Go!
- Evacuation.

345
00:43:16,136 --> 00:43:18,472
This is not a drill.

346
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:30,150
- Evacuation.
- Get on board!

347
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:34,863
Your attention, please.

00:43:45,124 --> 00:43:47,251
Level 39.

353
00:43:49,128 --> 00:43:53,298
Evacuation. Proceed to lifeboats.

354
00:43:53,465 --> 00:43:55,467
This is not a drill.

355
00:43:55,676 --> 00:43:58,345
Thank you for your cooperation.

356
00:45:05,037 --> 00:45:08,123
I'll give you holes, you slimy bastard!

357
00:45:13,045 --> 00:45:14,213
Move it! Go!

358
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:16,924
- Final lifeboat ready for launch.
- Get on board!

359
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:27,810
- Go!
- Complete evacuation now.

360
00:45:34,316 --> 00:45:35,984
No!

361
00:45:36,485 --> 00:45:37,653
Grenade.

362
00:46:31,331 --> 00:46:33,792
Alert. Alert.

363
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:36,128
Evacuation incomplete.

364
00:46:37,129 --> 00:46:40,799
Civilian presence detected in Area H.

365
00:46:40,966 --> 00:46:45,470
Warning,
main vessel declared uninhabitable.

366
00:46:53,103 --> 00:46:56,481
- Elgyn, come on. Let's move, man.
- Yeah.

367
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:20,732
Elgyn? Elgyn, where are you?

368
00:48:29,408 --> 00:48:32,119
Elgyn, where are you?

369
00:48:34,788 --> 00:48:36,707
Elgyn!

370
00:49:14,411 --> 00:49:16,163
Elgyn!

371
00:49:16,788 --> 00:49:19,833
- Oh, my God. Elgyn!
- Elgyn?

372
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,626
Elgyn?

373
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:24,379
Elgyn?

374
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:26,673
Easy, Hillard!

375
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:30,052
- Give me a hand. Give me a hand here!
- Get him up! Get him up!

376
00:49:30,218 --> 00:49:32,971
- Come on, let's get him up.
- Move out of the way!

377
00:49:33,805 --> 00:49:34,806
Shit.

378
00:49:34,973 --> 00:49:38,310
- What the fuck did this?
- What's in this place?

379
00:49:44,316 --> 00:49:46,610
- Call, get down!
- What the fuck is that?

380
00:49:46,777 --> 00:49:49,404
Don't shoot! It's in front of the hull!

381
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:55,327
- What is that?
- Come on, man, time to go. Time to go.

382
00:49:55,494 --> 00:49:56,495
Get back!

383
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:01,166
Time to go!

384
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:02,709
Come on, Call!

385
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:04,920
Open the goddamn door!

386
00:50:05,087 --> 00:50:10,092
We can't open it! We can't open that.
We can't open the door!

387
00:50:14,262 --> 00:50:18,600
- We gotta go back!
- I'm not going back. You go back.

388
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,710
What the fuck?

389
00:50:48,213 --> 00:50:51,007
Was it everything you hoped for?

390
00:50:52,175 --> 00:50:54,094
Leave him alone.

391
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:05,981
What do we do now, man?

392
00:51:06,148 --> 00:51:09,317
Same thing we're doing.
We get the hell out of here.

393
00:51:09,484 --> 00:51:11,736
What if there's more?

394
00:51:11,903 --> 00:51:15,740
I say we stay here, man.
Let the army guys deal.

395
00:51:15,907 --> 00:51:20,203
- Where the fuck are the army guys?
- They're dead.

396
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:23,248
- Then we don't need this asshole anymore.
- Step back!

397
00:51:23,415 --> 00:51:25,000
- No, you step back.
- Stop it!

398
00:51:25,167 --> 00:51:26,793
You got no authority here!

399
00:51:29,588 --> 00:51:32,465
Doctor, that thing that killed my partner.

400
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:36,094
- That's your pet science project?
- Yes.

401
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:39,514
- Let me do him right now, man.
- I should let him do you right now.

402
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:42,017
How many more are there?

403
00:51:42,184 --> 00:51:44,352
How many more are there?

404
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:45,520
Twelve.

405
00:51:48,398 --> 00:51:50,442
Twelve?

406
00:51:50,609 --> 00:51:51,943
Twelve.

407
00:51:54,279 --> 00:51:56,531
Twelve.

408
00:51:56,698 --> 00:51:58,533
There'll be more.

409
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:05,415
So who do I have to fuck
to get off this boat?

410
00:52:08,126 --> 00:52:11,588
I can get you off.
Maybe not the boat, but...

411
00:52:13,423 --> 00:52:14,633
Let's get out of here.

412
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:18,053
No, wait a second here.
She was the host for these monsters.

413
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:21,348
Wren cloned her
because she had one inside her.

414
00:52:21,514 --> 00:52:23,225
She's not human.

415
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:27,312
She was part of his experiment
and she will turn on us in a second.

416
00:52:27,479 --> 00:52:30,857
- I don't give a shit what she is.
- She's too much of a risk.

417
00:52:31,024 --> 00:52:33,276
- We have to leave her.
- She comes.

418
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:37,197
- We can't trust her.
- I don't trust anyone.

419
00:52:41,493 --> 00:52:46,164
If we're gonna survive this mess,
we all stick together. Agreed?

420
00:52:57,509 --> 00:52:59,177
Hillard, we gotta go.

421
00:52:59,678 --> 00:53:01,596
It's not over. We gotta get to the <i>Betty.</i>

422
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:33,044
Make a nice souvenir.

423
00:53:41,177 --> 00:53:44,973
- I can't believe you did that.
- Did what?

424
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:47,267
Killed one. It's like killing your own kind.

425
00:53:47,434 --> 00:53:49,769
It was in my way.

426
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:14,836
Oh, man.

427
00:54:19,257 --> 00:54:22,135
Who were you expecting? Santa Claus?

428
00:54:23,094 --> 00:54:26,097
I thought you were toast for certain, man.

429
00:54:26,598 --> 00:54:28,933
Where's Elgyn?

430
00:54:32,771 --> 00:54:35,482
- Shit.
- What if they're all over the <i>Betty?</i>

431
00:54:35,648 --> 00:54:38,693
All the activity's been in the F sector.
Why would they move?

432
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:42,906
They won't.
If they send anyone out, it'll be...

433
00:54:43,531 --> 00:54:44,741
...here.

434
00:54:45,283 --> 00:54:47,285
Where the meat is.

435
00:54:47,577 --> 00:54:51,581
Yeah. Well, I say if we wanna make
any decent time, I say we ditch the cripple.

436
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:56,336
- No offense, man.
- None taken.

437
00:54:56,503 --> 00:54:58,463
Nobody is left behind.

438
00:54:59,047 --> 00:55:01,257
Not even you, Johner.

439
00:55:02,759 --> 00:55:06,971
- What's the quickest way out of here?
- After the cooling tower, there's an elevator.

440
00:55:07,138 --> 00:55:10,475
It runs from the top of the ship
down to engineering, Level 1 deck.

441
00:55:10,642 --> 00:55:14,729
- Take us straight to the dock.
- Sounds reasonable. Let's do it.

442
00:55:16,147 --> 00:55:18,483
We're moving.

443
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:22,320
- What?
- The ship is moving. I can feel it.

444
00:55:22,821 --> 00:55:26,241
The ship has stealth-run.
There's no way you can tell.

445
00:55:27,826 --> 00:55:31,329
- She's right.
- The ship's been go since the attack.

446
00:55:31,496 --> 00:55:34,165
It's a standard emergency procedure.

447
00:55:34,332 --> 00:55:38,378
That's right. Any serious problem,
the ship autopilots back to home base.

448
00:55:38,545 --> 00:55:41,172
And you were planning on
letting us know this?

449
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:43,508
Nobody asked.

450
00:55:43,675 --> 00:55:46,010
What's home base?

451
00:55:48,638 --> 00:55:50,932
Earth.

452
00:55:51,099 --> 00:55:53,226
- Great.
- Bastard.

453
00:55:53,393 --> 00:55:56,855
Earth? I'd rather stay here
with the things, man.

454
00:55:57,647 --> 00:56:00,900
- How long until we get to Earth?
- Three hours almost.

455
00:56:01,067 --> 00:56:03,111
We gotta blow the ship.

456
00:56:03,278 --> 00:56:05,989
Call! You're not blowing this ship.

457
00:56:06,823 --> 00:56:09,284
Not while we're on it, okay?

458
00:56:09,451 --> 00:56:12,662
We get out of the ship,
you do as you please, all right?

459
00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:17,625
Earth, man. What a shithole.

460
00:56:25,592 --> 00:56:27,469
It's clear.

461
00:56:33,725 --> 00:56:35,643
Hey, Ripley.

462
00:56:39,397 --> 00:56:44,027
I heard you, like,
ran into these things before.

463
00:56:44,194 --> 00:56:47,530
- That's right.
- Wow, man.

464
00:56:47,697 --> 00:56:51,242
So, like, what did you do?

465
00:56:53,912 --> 00:56:55,872
I died.

466
00:57:22,232 --> 00:57:24,275
Not that way!

467
00:57:29,781 --> 00:57:31,533
Ripley.

468
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:40,291
Ripley, come on.

469
00:57:42,502 --> 00:57:45,547
Ripley, we got no time for sightseeing here.

470
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:52,470
Ripley, don't.

471
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:55,593
Kill...

472
00:59:56,594 --> 00:59:57,595
...me.

473
01:00:07,772 --> 01:00:10,066
Kill me.

474
01:01:51,918 --> 01:01:54,212
Don't do it, Ripley.

475
01:02:01,511 --> 01:02:03,846
Don't do what?

476
01:02:15,608 --> 01:02:18,277
What's the big deal, man?

477
01:02:18,444 --> 01:02:20,446
Fucking waste of ammo.

478
01:02:20,613 --> 01:02:22,240
Let's go.

479
01:02:24,367 --> 01:02:26,619
It must be a chick thing.

480
01:03:36,314 --> 01:03:39,650
Am I dreaming or is this not
the shit we brought with us?

481
01:03:39,817 --> 01:03:42,403
Yeah. It's the same shit.

482
01:03:43,321 --> 01:03:45,948
It stinks in here, man. Let's keep moving.

483
01:04:17,146 --> 01:04:18,981
Get away from me!

484
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:20,524
Get away from me!

485
01:04:20,691 --> 01:04:22,777
Get away from me!
Get away from me!

486
01:04:22,944 --> 01:04:24,528
- Drop the rod.
- Get away from me!

487
01:04:24,695 --> 01:04:27,698
- Do it!
- Get away from me.

488
01:04:29,992 --> 01:04:31,577
Get away from me.

489
01:04:33,079 --> 01:04:35,289
Who are you people?

490
01:04:35,831 --> 01:04:38,459
- What's happening here?
- Calm down.

491
01:04:38,626 --> 01:04:42,588
What's happening here is we're
getting the fuck off this ghost ship, okay?

492
01:04:43,464 --> 01:04:45,466
Ship? What ship?

493
01:04:46,968 --> 01:04:48,844
Where am I?

494
01:04:49,011 --> 01:04:52,682
I was in cryo, right?
On my way to Xarem, right?

495
01:04:52,848 --> 01:04:55,351
Work crew for the nickel refinery, right?

496
01:04:55,518 --> 01:04:58,813
I wake up...
I know I don't understand.

497
01:05:00,398 --> 01:05:02,441
Oh, God. I--

498
01:05:02,608 --> 01:05:05,486
I saw-- I saw horrible things.

499
01:05:06,195 --> 01:05:09,782
Look, you're coming with us.
It's too dangerous for you here.

500
01:05:20,835 --> 01:05:22,336
Leave him.

501
01:05:22,503 --> 01:05:25,464
Fuck you. We're not leaving him here.

502
01:05:25,631 --> 01:05:29,510
He's got one inside of him. I can smell it.

503
01:05:32,471 --> 01:05:34,265
Inside me?

504
01:05:36,017 --> 01:05:38,519
Inside me? What's inside me?

505
01:05:38,686 --> 01:05:42,023
Hey, I don't want one of those things
birthing anywhere near my ass.

506
01:05:42,189 --> 01:05:46,027
- It's a bad risk.
- What's inside me?

507
01:05:46,277 --> 01:05:49,989
- Look, we can't just leave him here.
- You came here to stop them from spreading.

508
01:05:50,156 --> 01:05:53,034
- What's inside me?
- Gotta be a process. Can't you stop it?

509
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:56,996
- We've got no time for that.
- We can't do it here. The lab's out of order.

510
01:05:57,163 --> 01:05:58,372
I could do him.

511
01:05:58,539 --> 01:06:01,459
Back of the head. Painless.
It might be the best way.

512
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:02,710
What's inside me?

513
01:06:02,877 --> 01:06:05,588
- No, there's got to be another way.
- What if we freeze him?

514
01:06:05,755 --> 01:06:07,631
What's in-fucking-side me?!

515
01:06:07,798 --> 01:06:09,633
A parasite!

516
01:06:12,094 --> 01:06:13,304
A foreign element.

517
01:06:19,018 --> 01:06:22,063
There's a monster in your chest.

518
01:06:22,229 --> 01:06:25,316
These guys hijacked your ship...

519
01:06:25,483 --> 01:06:30,321
...and they sold your cryotube
to this human.

520
01:06:30,488 --> 01:06:33,449
And he put an alien inside of you.

521
01:06:33,741 --> 01:06:36,494
It's a really nasty one.

522
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:40,956
And in a few hours, it's gonna
burst its way through your rib cage...

523
01:06:41,749 --> 01:06:43,584
...and you're gonna die.

524
01:06:49,507 --> 01:06:51,592
Any questions?

525
01:06:57,973 --> 01:06:59,934
Who are you?

526
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:04,605
I'm the monster's mother.

527
01:07:07,775 --> 01:07:11,403
He comes with us, we freeze him on
the <i>Betty,</i> the doctor can remove it later.

528
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:14,657
- Fine by me.
- Since when were you in goddamn charge?

529
01:07:14,824 --> 01:07:16,784
Since you were born without balls.

530
01:07:16,992 --> 01:07:19,120
Ease off, people!

531
01:07:27,169 --> 01:07:31,132
All right, you come with us.
You might even live.

532
01:07:31,632 --> 01:07:34,385
Get twitchy on me and you'll be shot.

533
01:07:35,678 --> 01:07:37,388
Let's move out.

534
01:07:48,232 --> 01:07:50,693
It's a mess down there.
Is this the only way?

535
01:07:50,943 --> 01:07:54,822
Vriess. We gotta lose the chair.

536
01:07:56,532 --> 01:07:58,576
I know.

537
01:07:58,742 --> 01:08:02,913
- Kawlang maneuver, right?
- Yeah. Just like old times.

538
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:04,832
Yeah.

539
01:08:08,919 --> 01:08:11,213
Must be the cooling tanks.

540
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:13,841
Somebody must have opened the valves.

541
01:08:14,008 --> 01:08:16,844
The nasties couldn't have done this,
could they?

542
01:08:28,564 --> 01:08:31,150
We're at the bottom of the ship.

543
01:08:31,317 --> 01:08:34,528
We have to go through the kitchen.
Maybe 90 feet.

544
01:08:34,695 --> 01:08:37,156
To the freight elevator on the other side.

545
01:08:38,616 --> 01:08:41,452
- I don't like it.
- What's to like?

546
01:08:43,078 --> 01:08:47,249
- This sucks!
- Wren, are you sure about the distance?

547
01:08:47,416 --> 01:08:48,626
Yes.

548
01:08:49,793 --> 01:08:52,755
- You ready to get wet, partner?
- Yeah.

549
01:09:01,263 --> 01:09:04,934
Hey, will your weapons fly underwater?

550
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:07,519
Yeah, they're disposables.
They can take it.

551
01:09:07,686 --> 01:09:09,063
Disposables?

552
01:09:13,525 --> 01:09:15,903
Hey, I heard about those. Yeah.

553
01:09:18,072 --> 01:09:20,866
- How many rounds?
- Twenty.

554
01:09:21,033 --> 01:09:25,579
Split points give you a good hole,
even if it's smaller caliber.

555
01:09:25,746 --> 01:09:27,748
That's cool.

556
01:09:28,749 --> 01:09:31,919
They're big with hitters
because you throw them away after the job.

557
01:09:32,086 --> 01:09:35,172
Nobody likes to throw away a weapon
they're attached to, you know?

558
01:09:35,339 --> 01:09:36,840
Yeah.

559
01:09:37,007 --> 01:09:40,761
Guess I don't have to tell everyone
to take a deep breath.

560
01:09:45,766 --> 01:09:47,476
Hey, Christie, do me a favor.

561
01:09:47,643 --> 01:09:52,106
When we hit the surface on the other side,
no backstroke, okay?

562
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:28,363
Jesus Christ!

563
01:13:40,709 --> 01:13:44,880
They set a goddamn trap.
It's a goddamn ambush!

564
01:14:50,737 --> 01:14:52,322
Distephano!

565
01:15:12,634 --> 01:15:15,846
It won't break. Give me your weapon.

566
01:15:16,888 --> 01:15:19,516
You really are way too trusting.

567
01:15:19,683 --> 01:15:20,851
No!

568
01:15:30,819 --> 01:15:32,195
No!

569
01:15:40,871 --> 01:15:44,583
You killed her! You bastard!

570
01:15:48,712 --> 01:15:51,256
I'll get you!

571
01:15:52,674 --> 01:15:55,010
Father, lock the door.

572
01:16:10,359 --> 01:16:12,694
Christie! Climb!

573
01:16:12,861 --> 01:16:14,780
Climb! Come on!

574
01:16:15,197 --> 01:16:17,074
Come on!

575
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,951
It's jammed! Move it!

576
01:16:20,118 --> 01:16:22,496
It's jammed!

577
01:16:55,112 --> 01:16:57,239
Get off my foot, bitch!

578
01:17:10,085 --> 01:17:11,878
Johner!

579
01:17:12,045 --> 01:17:14,131
Get off me! Get off me!

580
01:17:15,799 --> 01:17:17,843
Johner!

581
01:17:21,513 --> 01:17:23,515
Die, motherfucker!

582
01:17:25,642 --> 01:17:27,352
Do it, man!

583
01:17:44,536 --> 01:17:46,955
Real nice party, ain't it?

584
01:18:15,609 --> 01:18:16,818
Christie!

585
01:18:17,694 --> 01:18:19,446
Christie!

586
01:18:20,197 --> 01:18:21,364
Christie!

587
01:18:21,531 --> 01:18:22,949
No!

588
01:18:23,116 --> 01:18:24,785
Christie!

589
01:18:25,869 --> 01:18:27,454
Christie!

590
01:18:27,746 --> 01:18:31,041
What are you doing? Don't do it!

591
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:32,417
Don't!

592
01:18:32,751 --> 01:18:35,253
We can make it!

593
01:18:35,629 --> 01:18:37,172
No!

594
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,136
Damn.

595
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,435
This way.

596
01:19:35,981 --> 01:19:37,107
Come on!

597
01:19:42,279 --> 01:19:44,114
Baby, am I glad to see you.

598
01:19:44,281 --> 01:19:46,992
I was sure that asshole got you.
Are you hurt?

599
01:19:47,158 --> 01:19:48,910
I'm fine.

600
01:19:49,327 --> 01:19:52,622
- You got body armor on?
- Yeah. Come on.

601
01:19:52,789 --> 01:19:55,625
You took it in the chest. I saw it.

602
01:20:17,355 --> 01:20:19,649
You're a robot?

603
01:20:20,817 --> 01:20:24,029
Son of a bitch! Our little Call
is just full of surprises.

604
01:20:24,195 --> 01:20:28,199
I should've known.
No human being is that humane.

605
01:20:28,366 --> 01:20:30,827
I thought synthetics
were supposed to be logical.

606
01:20:30,994 --> 01:20:33,496
You just a big old psycho, girl.

607
01:20:33,663 --> 01:20:37,083
- You're a robot?
- You're a Second Gen, aren't you?

608
01:20:38,293 --> 01:20:40,420
You're an Auton.

609
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:44,758
Robots designed by robots, right?

610
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:46,801
That's right, I remember.

611
01:20:46,968 --> 01:20:49,888
They were supposed to revitalize
the synthetic industry.

612
01:20:50,055 --> 01:20:52,098
Instead they buried it.

613
01:20:52,933 --> 01:20:55,435
They don't like being told what to do.

614
01:20:55,602 --> 01:20:57,729
The government ordered a recall.

615
01:20:57,896 --> 01:20:59,272
Now, I heard...

616
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:03,443
I had heard that only a few--
Just a few had gotten out in time.

617
01:21:03,610 --> 01:21:06,696
Man, I never thought
that I would see one!

618
01:21:06,947 --> 01:21:10,784
Great. She's a toaster oven.

619
01:21:10,951 --> 01:21:12,953
Can we leave now?

620
01:21:14,996 --> 01:21:18,291
- How long before we land?
- Just under two hours.

621
01:21:18,458 --> 01:21:21,836
Hey, Vriess, you got a socket wrench?
Maybe she just needs an oil change.

622
01:21:22,003 --> 01:21:23,964
I'm sorry. Access denied.

623
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:28,093
- I can't believe I almost fucked it.
- Yeah, like you never fucked a robot!

624
01:21:28,259 --> 01:21:30,971
You know, if Wren gets in the computer,
he could screw us.

625
01:21:31,137 --> 01:21:34,474
- We gotta find a terminal.
- No, there's no console on this level.

626
01:21:34,641 --> 01:21:37,310
- We'd have to go back.
- Well, we can't go back.

627
01:21:37,477 --> 01:21:39,938
- And I don't know Wren's access codes.
- Help me.

628
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:43,858
Call.

629
01:21:44,985 --> 01:21:47,028
No, I can't.

630
01:21:47,195 --> 01:21:51,282
Right. You're the new model droid.
You can access the mainframe by remote.

631
01:21:51,449 --> 01:21:55,203
No, I can't. I burned my modem.
We all did.

632
01:21:55,370 --> 01:21:59,165
Call, you can still patch in manually,
you know that.

633
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:02,919
There's ports in the chapel, up there.

634
01:22:04,504 --> 01:22:06,172
Call.

635
01:22:11,469 --> 01:22:15,181
- You're programmed for that?
- Don't make me do this.

636
01:22:15,348 --> 01:22:18,351
Don't make me make you.

637
01:22:18,518 --> 01:22:20,937
I don't wanna go in there.

638
01:22:21,104 --> 01:22:23,815
It's like my insides are liquid.
It's not real.

639
01:22:24,274 --> 01:22:28,194
Get over it. You can blow this ship
before it reaches Earth...

640
01:22:28,903 --> 01:22:30,196
...and kill them all.

641
01:22:40,707 --> 01:22:43,668
Just give us time to get out first.

642
01:22:46,504 --> 01:22:48,506
- Damn it.
- Anything?

643
01:22:48,673 --> 01:22:50,341
Hold on.

644
01:22:54,721 --> 01:22:58,600
Breach in Sector 7, Sector 3.

645
01:22:58,767 --> 01:23:01,728
Sector 9 unstable.

646
01:23:02,228 --> 01:23:04,689
Engines operating at 41 percent.

647
01:23:04,856 --> 01:23:08,068
Eighty-six minutes until Earth dock.

648
01:23:08,234 --> 01:23:10,278
We burned too much energy.

649
01:23:10,445 --> 01:23:14,407
I can't make critical mass.
I can't blow it.

650
01:23:14,574 --> 01:23:16,076
Then crash it.

651
01:23:29,881 --> 01:23:33,051
I'm okay. I'm okay.

652
01:23:34,094 --> 01:23:35,637
Really.

653
01:23:36,471 --> 01:23:38,181
I feel good.

654
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:42,102
Ground level recalibrated.

655
01:23:42,268 --> 01:23:47,232
New destination: 7-6-0-4-0-3.
Uninhabited quadrant.

656
01:23:47,857 --> 01:23:52,153
Braking system's offline.
Deceleration increase.

657
01:23:53,363 --> 01:23:57,617
Time until impact
now 43 minutes, 8 seconds.

658
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:01,955
Try to clear us a path to the <i>Betty.</i>

659
01:24:02,664 --> 01:24:04,207
And start her up.

660
01:24:34,362 --> 01:24:35,780
Please wait.

661
01:24:40,952 --> 01:24:44,330
Emergency override
in console 45V, Level 1.

662
01:24:48,042 --> 01:24:50,253
It's Wren. He's almost at the <i>Betty.</i>

663
01:25:03,725 --> 01:25:07,645
Father, locate the power drain. Report.

664
01:25:09,689 --> 01:25:13,193
Father? Father?

665
01:25:18,281 --> 01:25:21,159
Father's dead, asshole.

666
01:25:24,537 --> 01:25:30,293
Intruder on Level 1.
All aliens, please proceed to Level 1.

667
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:33,254
You got a mean streak.

668
01:25:37,884 --> 01:25:38,927
Damn it.

669
01:25:39,093 --> 01:25:41,137
- Let me see.
- Don't touch me.

670
01:25:41,304 --> 01:25:42,847
Come on.

671
01:25:43,681 --> 01:25:46,517
You must think this is pretty funny.

672
01:25:47,477 --> 01:25:50,438
I'm finding a lot of things funny lately.

673
01:25:50,605 --> 01:25:53,024
But I don't think they are.

674
01:26:00,615 --> 01:26:03,076
Why do you go on living?

675
01:26:05,161 --> 01:26:07,705
How can you stand being what you are?

676
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:11,084
Not much choice.

677
01:26:15,213 --> 01:26:17,757
At least there's part of you
that's human.

678
01:26:19,050 --> 01:26:20,635
I'm just...

679
01:26:20,802 --> 01:26:22,095
Look at me.

680
01:26:23,054 --> 01:26:25,265
I'm disgusting.

681
01:26:26,975 --> 01:26:29,394
Why did you come here?

682
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:31,771
To kill you. Remember?

683
01:26:32,021 --> 01:26:33,898
Before the recall...

684
01:26:34,065 --> 01:26:37,068
...l accessed the mainframe.

685
01:26:37,235 --> 01:26:41,322
Every dirty little covert op
the government ever dreamed up is in there.

686
01:26:41,489 --> 01:26:46,035
And this, you, the aliens,
even the crew from the <i>Betty.</i>

687
01:26:46,202 --> 01:26:49,247
I knew if they succeeded,
it'd be the end of them.

688
01:26:49,414 --> 01:26:51,624
Why do you care what happens to them?

689
01:26:52,542 --> 01:26:54,627
Because I'm programmed to.

690
01:26:55,378 --> 01:26:57,672
You're programmed to be an asshole?

691
01:26:58,881 --> 01:27:01,968
You're the new asshole model
they're putting out?

692
01:27:02,218 --> 01:27:03,469
Come on.

693
01:27:05,513 --> 01:27:08,057
I couldn't watch them do it.

694
01:27:08,224 --> 01:27:11,811
I couldn't let them annihilate themselves.

695
01:27:11,978 --> 01:27:14,314
Do you understand that?

696
01:27:17,317 --> 01:27:19,152
I did once.

697
01:27:19,319 --> 01:27:22,947
I tried to save people.

698
01:27:23,114 --> 01:27:25,575
It didn't work out.

699
01:27:25,742 --> 01:27:28,286
There was this girl.

700
01:27:30,997 --> 01:27:33,708
She had bad dreams.

701
01:27:33,875 --> 01:27:36,669
I tried to help her.

702
01:27:36,878 --> 01:27:38,755
She died.

703
01:27:40,006 --> 01:27:42,842
Now I can't even remember her name.

704
01:27:47,597 --> 01:27:49,640
I guess we're almost there.

705
01:27:50,099 --> 01:27:51,601
Right.

706
01:27:53,436 --> 01:27:59,275
- Do you dream?
- I-- We have neural processors that-- Yes.

707
01:27:59,442 --> 01:28:02,987
When I sleep, I dream about them. It.

708
01:28:03,154 --> 01:28:04,781
Every night.

709
01:28:04,947 --> 01:28:07,241
All around me. In me.

710
01:28:07,408 --> 01:28:10,703
I used to be afraid to dream,
but I'm not anymore.

711
01:28:10,870 --> 01:28:12,497
Why?

712
01:28:13,414 --> 01:28:18,669
Because no matter how bad the dreams
get, when I wake up it's always worse.

713
01:28:22,882 --> 01:28:25,885
- It's not so far now!
- God, I'm so tired!

714
01:28:26,052 --> 01:28:27,512
Sleep when you die, man.

715
01:28:39,065 --> 01:28:41,400
Oh, no. This is bad, right?

716
01:28:42,110 --> 01:28:43,861
I think we're near the nest.

717
01:28:44,028 --> 01:28:47,115
- Well, then, we'll go another way.
- We don't have time.

718
01:28:47,281 --> 01:28:49,283
- We got nearly 90 minutes.
- Not anymore.

719
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:51,244
What are you saying?

720
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:54,330
- What did you do, robot?
- Let's go. Come on.

721
01:28:54,497 --> 01:28:58,876
Hey! You wanna die here with your
little brothers and sisters, that's cool.

722
01:28:59,043 --> 01:29:01,212
But I plan to live past today.

723
01:29:01,379 --> 01:29:04,340
If this little hunk of plastic
is pulling any shit...

724
01:29:04,507 --> 01:29:06,134
...I'm gonna kill her!

725
01:29:07,301 --> 01:29:08,594
Kill you!

726
01:29:08,761 --> 01:29:12,431
Does that compute?
Or do I have to draw you a schematic?

727
01:29:13,266 --> 01:29:15,059
Hey!

728
01:29:17,562 --> 01:29:19,689
You want another souvenir?

729
01:29:26,988 --> 01:29:29,782
- How far are the docks?
- A hundred yards.

730
01:29:41,002 --> 01:29:42,712
Ripley?

731
01:29:44,130 --> 01:29:46,215
Ripley?

732
01:29:47,049 --> 01:29:49,135
Come on.

733
01:29:49,302 --> 01:29:51,637
Ripley, we have to go.

734
01:29:53,139 --> 01:29:57,018
I hear them. I hear them.
They're so close.

735
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:00,188
- Ripley.
- It's the queen.

736
01:30:00,980 --> 01:30:03,441
She's in pain.

737
01:30:06,444 --> 01:30:08,404
Ripley!

738
01:30:08,863 --> 01:30:10,990
Ripley!

739
01:30:11,157 --> 01:30:12,909
Wait!

740
01:30:35,181 --> 01:30:36,557
Oh, my God.

741
01:30:49,695 --> 01:30:54,784
We gotta be moving. The best thing
we can do is pray for a quick death.

742
01:30:54,951 --> 01:30:57,787
Come on. Come on.

743
01:30:57,954 --> 01:31:02,208
- It's not right.
- I've been saying that all day.

744
01:31:59,598 --> 01:32:00,850
It's up to you now, Call.

745
01:32:01,017 --> 01:32:04,812
I need you to patch into the ship again,
and open the hatch.

746
01:32:15,448 --> 01:32:18,576
Johner, we should put Purvis
in the freezer now.

747
01:32:18,743 --> 01:32:20,786
All right, little buddy.

748
01:32:21,746 --> 01:32:23,539
Nap time.

749
01:32:30,921 --> 01:32:35,301
Nobody moves, or I put a cap
right where this little droid's brain is.

750
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:40,639
- Distephano, take the weapons.
- Begging your pardon, sir, but fuck you!

751
01:32:40,806 --> 01:32:43,100
Oh, fine. Then I kill her...

752
01:32:43,267 --> 01:32:45,811
...and you kill me, and we all die...

753
01:32:45,978 --> 01:32:47,563
...and nobody goes home!

754
01:32:47,813 --> 01:32:50,775
Now drop the weapon.

755
01:32:54,612 --> 01:32:58,741
Then this little synthetic bitch
is gonna plug into the <i>Auriga...</i>

756
01:32:58,908 --> 01:33:01,660
...and she is gonna take us
right back to home base...

757
01:33:01,827 --> 01:33:04,497
...according to the standard
emergency procedures.

758
01:33:04,663 --> 01:33:06,957
- No, she's not.
- Are you crazy?

759
01:33:07,124 --> 01:33:09,377
You still wanna bring those things
back to Earth?

760
01:33:09,543 --> 01:33:13,464
- Haven't you been paying attention today?
- The intellectual speaks.

761
01:33:14,632 --> 01:33:18,594
- Listen, if you don't--
- Don't you ever shut up?

762
01:33:30,648 --> 01:33:32,274
Why does nobody listen to me?

763
01:34:16,318 --> 01:34:20,990
I told you, at first everything was normal.
The queen laid her eggs.

764
01:34:21,157 --> 01:34:25,744
But then she started to change.
She added a second cycle, so...

765
01:34:28,706 --> 01:34:30,416
So...

766
01:34:34,753 --> 01:34:38,048
...this time there is no host.

767
01:34:38,215 --> 01:34:40,593
There are no eggs.

768
01:34:40,759 --> 01:34:44,430
There is only her womb...

769
01:34:44,597 --> 01:34:47,308
...and the creature inside.

770
01:34:47,475 --> 01:34:53,939
That is Ripley's gift to her,
a human reproductive system.

771
01:34:54,106 --> 01:34:57,401
She is giving birth for you, Ripley.

772
01:34:57,568 --> 01:35:01,906
And now she is perfect!

773
01:36:27,032 --> 01:36:30,369
You are...

774
01:36:30,786 --> 01:36:36,834
...a beautiful, beautiful butterfly.

775
01:37:04,820 --> 01:37:05,904
No!

776
01:37:10,909 --> 01:37:12,369
No. No.

777
01:38:06,924 --> 01:38:08,634
Look.

778
01:38:08,801 --> 01:38:13,514
Look, beautiful, beautiful little baby.

779
01:38:14,598 --> 01:38:16,809
Look, it thinks you're its mother.

780
01:38:22,189 --> 01:38:23,357
Come on.

781
01:38:24,650 --> 01:38:26,610
Come on.

782
01:38:34,785 --> 01:38:36,286
Come on.

783
01:38:53,846 --> 01:38:58,308
Civilian vessel online.
Emergency departure authorized.

784
01:39:02,354 --> 01:39:06,817
All right, she's hot. I'll open the <i>Auriga's</i>
air locks. Pull the holding clamps.

785
01:39:07,025 --> 01:39:12,364
Right, I just need to find
the vertical thrust lock.

786
01:39:17,703 --> 01:39:20,497
- Are you sure you guys can fly this thing?
- Yes.

787
01:39:34,762 --> 01:39:38,223
- Launch status is go.
- No!

788
01:39:40,309 --> 01:39:41,935
Ripley.

789
01:40:10,589 --> 01:40:12,257
- Hey.
- I thought you were dead.

790
01:40:12,424 --> 01:40:14,343
Yeah, I get that a lot.

791
01:40:14,927 --> 01:40:21,266
- Why are we still here?
- I'm just finding the manual override.

792
01:40:21,934 --> 01:40:23,393
- For chrissake.
- Hey, Ripley.

793
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:25,437
Good memory. Excuse me.

794
01:40:25,604 --> 01:40:27,272
- Ripley's back, man.
- Is that it?

795
01:40:27,439 --> 01:40:28,941
Nope.

796
01:40:29,483 --> 01:40:31,610
You can't fly one of these things too,
can you?

797
01:40:31,777 --> 01:40:35,030
Are you kidding?
This piece of shit is even older than I am.

798
01:40:35,197 --> 01:40:38,575
Goddamn it! We still got breach.
The hatch.

799
01:40:38,742 --> 01:40:41,703
- I closed it.
- I've fixed the hatch a hundred times, man.

800
01:40:41,870 --> 01:40:44,498
I'll get it. I'll get it.

801
01:41:06,311 --> 01:41:12,901
Approaching Earth's atmosphere.
Window of departure now 46 seconds.

802
01:41:14,319 --> 01:41:17,239
Call? We have to go.

803
01:41:18,615 --> 01:41:20,325
Call.

804
01:41:22,911 --> 01:41:24,705
We've gotta get out of here.

805
01:41:29,376 --> 01:41:33,797
Window of departure now <i>20</i> seconds.

806
01:41:36,842 --> 01:41:40,345
Grab on to something, Call.
We're out of here.

807
01:41:56,028 --> 01:41:57,529
Come on, baby.

808
01:42:10,709 --> 01:42:13,253
This thing is gonna fall apart.

809
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:16,089
Pressure's unstable!

810
01:42:20,594 --> 01:42:23,847
Go help Call turn on the auxiliary pump.

811
01:42:51,249 --> 01:42:52,292
Distephano?

812
01:43:13,897 --> 01:43:15,983
Come on. Step on it.

813
01:43:16,149 --> 01:43:19,277
Hey! I'm not the mechanic here, Ironside.

814
01:43:19,444 --> 01:43:22,072
I mostly just hurt people.

815
01:43:22,239 --> 01:43:23,323
Shit.

816
01:43:23,490 --> 01:43:25,784
Call!

817
01:43:25,951 --> 01:43:28,787
Call, get back up here.

818
01:43:29,746 --> 01:43:32,416
Call! Call!

819
01:43:33,667 --> 01:43:37,087
Ripley. Hey, Ripley!

820
01:43:41,967 --> 01:43:46,054
Johner, where are you, you son of a bitch?
Get on it, bastard.

821
01:43:46,221 --> 01:43:49,766
- What am I supposed to do?
- Grab the sticks.

822
01:44:04,281 --> 01:44:06,158
Put her down.

823
01:45:43,421 --> 01:45:45,590
Ripley!

824
01:46:12,534 --> 01:46:14,452
I'm sorry.

825
01:46:44,524 --> 01:46:48,862
USM <i>Auriga</i> will impact in five seconds.
Four.

826
01:46:49,821 --> 01:46:51,072
Three.

827
01:46:51,239 --> 01:46:53,575
Two. One.

828
01:46:53,742 --> 01:46:54,784
Thank you.

829
01:47:19,851 --> 01:47:21,770
- What's burning?
- Us!

830
01:47:24,231 --> 01:47:26,650
Shit! You're right.

831
01:48:47,022 --> 01:48:49,566
So this is Earth, huh?

832
01:48:51,401 --> 01:48:53,445
This is Earth.

833
01:48:56,823 --> 01:48:59,451
It's my first time here.

834
01:49:03,288 --> 01:49:07,792
I suppose the military'll be
sniffing around here pretty soon.

835
01:49:07,959 --> 01:49:10,545
Bet you're not too anxious to see them.

836
01:49:10,712 --> 01:49:12,589
Not really.

837
01:49:13,798 --> 01:49:17,635
You know, a person could get pretty lost
around here if they wanted to.

838
01:49:19,846 --> 01:49:21,973
What do you think?

839
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:24,893
What should we do?

840
01:49:25,060 --> 01:49:27,062
I don't know.

841
01:49:28,438 --> 01:49:31,441
I'm a stranger here myself.

842
01:56:04,542 --> 01:56:06,544
