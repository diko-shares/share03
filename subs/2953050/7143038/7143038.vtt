00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:49.007
Open your eyes.

3
00:00:53.262 --> 00:00:55.931
This is where our magic comes from?

4
00:00:56.098 --> 00:00:56.974
Mm-hmm.

5
00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:03.105
This candle holds the miracle
given to our family.

6
00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:06.024
How did we get a miracle?

7
00:01:07.526 --> 00:01:09.194
Long ago...

8
00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:13.365
when my three babies had just been born...

9
00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:20.080
<i>your </i>abuelo<i> Pedro and
I were forced to flee our home.</i>

10
00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:25.627
<i>And though many joined us...</i>

11
00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:27.880
<i>hoping to find a new home...</i>

12
00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:31.800
<i>we could not escape the dangers.</i>..

13
00:01:35.137 --> 00:01:38.932
<i>and your </i>abuelo <i>was lost.</i>

14
00:01:41.727 --> 00:01:44.605
<i>But in our darkest moment...</i>

15
00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:48.609
<i>we were given a miracle.</i>

16
00:01:50.152 --> 00:01:55.782
<i>The candle became a magical flame
that could never go out.</i>

17
00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.121
<i>And it blessed us with a refuge
in which to live.</i>

18
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:06.460
<i>A place of wonder.</i>

19
00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:08.377
<i>An </i>encanto<i>.</i>

20
00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:10.047
<i>An </i>encanto<i>.</i>

21
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.259
<i>The miracle grew.</i>

22
00:02:17.346 --> 00:02:18.764
<i>And our house...</i>

23
00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:22.768
<i>our </i>casita <i>itself...</i>

24
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.064
<i>came alive to shelter us.</i>

25
00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:33.195
<i>When my children came of age...</i>

26
00:02:33.362 --> 00:02:38.492
<i>the miracle blessed each
with a magic Gift to help us.</i>

27
00:02:41.036 --> 00:02:43.372
<i>And when their children came of age...</i>

28
00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:45.374
<i>They got magic, too.</i>

29
00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.334
<i>That's right!</i>

30
00:02:47.543 --> 00:02:51.296
<i>And together, our family's Gifts...</i>

31
00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:55.843

Make your family proud.

35

Make my family proud.

36
00:03:21.577 --> 00:03:24.246
Yes, yes, <i>casita, </i>we're going!

37
00:03:30.294 --> 00:03:33.088
What do you think my Gift will be?

38
00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:36.884
You are a wonder, Mirabel Madrigal.

39
00:03:37.593 --> 00:03:39.511

00:04:32.648 --> 00:04:33.774
We're gonna find out!

47
00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:35.025
What's your Gift?

48
00:04:35.192 --> 00:04:36.235
Who's asking?

49
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:37.277

50
00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:42.616
{\an8}Well, "us," I can't just talk about myself.
I'm only part of the amazing Madrigals.

51
00:04:42.783 --> 00:04:44.368
Who's all the amazing Madrigals?

52
00:04:44.535 --> 00:04:46.537
Ah, you're not gonna leave me alone, are you?

53
00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:47.913
<i>Casita</i>, help me out.

54
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.081
Drawers!

55
00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:50.832
Floors!

56
00:04:51.333 --> 00:04:52.334
Doors!

57
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:53.794
Let's go!

58
00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:56.964
<i>This is our home
We've got every generation</i>

59
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.175
<i>So full of music
A rhythm of its own design</i>

60
00:05:00.384 --> 00:05:03.804
<i>This is my family
A perfect constellation</i>

61
00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:06.890
<i>So many stars
And everybody gets to shine</i>

62
00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:08.016
<i>Whoa</i>

63
00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:10.519
<i>But let's be clear
Abuela runs this show</i>

64
00:05:10.686 --> 00:05:14.064
<i>Whoa
She led us here so many years ago</i>

65
00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:17.359
<i>Whoa
And every year our family blessings grow</i>

66
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.863
<i>There's just a lot
You simply got to know so</i>

67
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:23.615
<i>Welcome to the family Madrigal</i>

68
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:26.743
<i>The home of the family Madrigal</i>

69
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:27.911
<i>We're on our way</i>

70
00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:31.331
<i>Where all the people are fantastical
And magical</i>

71
00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:33.750
<i>I'm part of the family Madrigal</i>

72
00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:36.295
-Oh, my gosh! It's them!
-What are the Gifts?

73
00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:38.589
-I can't remember all the Gifts!
-But I don't know who is who.

74
00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:40.007
All right, all right, relax!

75
00:05:40.174 --> 00:05:42.968
-It is physically impossible to relax!
-Tell us everything!

76
00:05:43.135 --> 00:05:45.637
-What are your powers?
-Just tell us what everyone can do!

77
00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:48.015
And that's why coffee's for grown-ups.

78
00:05:48.182 --> 00:05:51.643
<i>My tía Pepa
Her mood affects the weather</i>

79
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.980
<i>When she's unhappy
Well, the temperature gets weird</i>

80
00:05:55.147 --> 00:05:56.398
<i>My tío Bruno</i>

81
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.192
<i>We don't talk about Bruno!</i>

82
00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.070
<i>They say he saw the future
One day he disappeared</i>

83
00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:05.490
<i>Oh
And that's my mom Julieta, here's her deal</i>

84
00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:08.994
<i>Whoa
The truth is she can heal you with a meal</i>

85
00:06:09.161 --> 00:06:12.539
<i>Whoa
Her recipes are remedies for real</i>

86
00:06:12.748 --> 00:06:15.167
<i>If you're impressed
Imagine how I feel</i>

87
00:06:15.334 --> 00:06:16.251
Mom!

88
00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:18.712
<i>Welcome to the family Madrigal</i>

89
00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.632
<i>The home of the family Madrigal</i>

90
00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:23.008
Hey, coming through!

91
00:06:23.175 --> 00:06:26.094
<i>I know it sounds a bit fantastical
And magical</i>

92
00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:29.056
<i>But I'm part of the family Madrigal</i>

93
00:06:29.515 --> 00:06:32.226
-<i>Two guys fell in love with family Madrigal
-With family Madrigal</i>

94
00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:35.729
-<i>And now they're part of the family Madrigal
-The family Madrigal</i>

95
00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:39.191
<i>See, yeah, Tío Félix married Pepa
And my dad married Julieta</i>

96
00:06:39.358 --> 00:06:42.319
<i>-That's how Abuela became an abuela Madrigal
-Abuela Madrigal</i>

97
00:06:42.486 --> 00:06:43.570
<i>Let's go
Let's go</i>

98
00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:47.032
<i>We swear to always
Help those around us</i>

99
00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:50.410
<i>And earn the miracle
That somehow found us</i>

100
00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:53.247
<i>The town keeps growing
The world keeps turning</i>

101
00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:56.875
<i>But work and dedication
Will keep the miracle burning</i>

102
00:06:57.042 --> 00:07:00.671
<i>And each new generation
Must keep the miracle burning</i>

103
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.090
Wait, who's the sister and who's the cousin?

104
00:07:03.257 --> 00:07:04.299
There are so many people!

105
00:07:04.508 --> 00:07:05.551
How do you keep them all straight?

106
00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:07.344
Okay, okay, okay.

107
00:07:07.511 --> 00:07:10.639
<i>So many kids in our house
So, let's turn the sound up</i>

108
00:07:10.848 --> 00:07:14.142
<i>You know why?
I think it's time for a Grandkid Round-up!</i>

109
00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:15.978
<i>Grandkid Round-up</i>

110
00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:19.231
<i>Cousin Dolores can hear a pin drop</i>

111
00:07:19.398 --> 00:07:22.818
<i>Camilo shapeshifts
Antonio gets his Gift today</i>

112
00:07:22.985 --> 00:07:26.280
-<i>My older sisters Isabela and Luisa
</i>-<i>Isabela and Luisa</i>

113
00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:29.616
<i>One strong, one graceful
Perfect in every way</i>

114
00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:33.078
-<i>Isabela
</i>-<i>Grows a flower and the town goes wild</i>

115
00:07:33.245 --> 00:07:34.538
<i>Isabela</i>

116
00:07:34.705 --> 00:07:36.623
<i>She's the perfect golden child</i>

117
00:07:36.874 --> 00:07:38.125
<i>Luisa, Luisa</i>

118
00:07:38.292 --> 00:07:39.960
<i>And Luisa's super strong</i>

119
00:07:40.127 --> 00:07:42.379
<i>The beauty and the brawn do no wrong</i>

120
00:07:42.546 --> 00:07:44.256
-Let's get ready!
-Coming, <i>Abuela!</i>

121
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.508
<i>That's life in the family Madrigal</i>

122
00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:50.053
<i>Now you know the family Madrigal</i>

123
00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:54.308
<i>Where all the people are fantastical
And magical</i>

124
00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:57.644
<i>That's who we are in the family Madrigal
Adiós</i>

125
00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.439
But what's your Gift?

126
00:08:03.275 --> 00:08:05.360
<i>Well, I gotta go
The life of a Madrigal</i>

127
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.864
<i>But now you all know the family Madrigal</i>

128
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.743
<i>I never meant this to get autobiographical</i>

129
00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:15.829
<i>It was just to review the family Madrigal
Let's go</i>

130
00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:17.497
-<i>But what about Mirabel?
</i>-<i>It starts with Abuela</i>

131
00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:18.999
<i>And then Tía Pepa
She handles the weather</i>

132
00:08:19.166 --> 00:08:20.125
<i>But what about Mirabel?</i>

133
00:08:20.209 --> 00:08:22.169
<i>My mom Julieta can make you feel better
With just one arepa</i>

134
00:08:22.336 --> 00:08:23.378
-<i>But what about Mirabel?
</i>-<i>My dad Agustín</i>

135
00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:25.339
<i>Well he's accident-prone
But he means well</i>

136
00:08:25.506 --> 00:08:26.590
<i>But what about Mirabel?</i>

137
00:08:26.757 --> 00:08:28.592
<i>Hey you said you wanna know what
Everyone does, I got sisters and cousins and</i>

138
00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:29.593
<i>Mirabel</i>

139
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.346
<i>My primo Camilo won't stop
Until he makes you smile today</i>

140
00:08:32.638 --> 00:08:35.140
<i>My cousin Dolores can hear
This whole chorus a mile away</i>

141
00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:36.933
<i>Look
It's Mr. Mariano</i>

142
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.309
<i>Hey you can marry my sister if you wanna</i>

143
00:08:38.477 --> 00:08:39.852
<i>Between you and me
She's kind of a prima donna</i>

144
00:08:40.062 --> 00:08:42.481
<i>Oh, I've said too much
And thank you but I really gotta go</i>

145
00:08:42.648 --> 00:08:44.149
-<i>My family's amazing
</i>-<i>Mirabel</i>

146
00:08:44.316 --> 00:08:45.442
-<i>And I'm in my family so
</i>-<i>Mirabel</i>

147
00:08:45.609 --> 00:08:46.443
<i>Well</i>

148
00:08:46.527 --> 00:08:48.195
Mirabel!

149
00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:51.907
What are you doing?

150
00:08:52.908 --> 00:08:54.868
They were just asking about the family and...

151
00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:58.747
She was about to tell us
about her super awesome Gift!

152
00:08:58.914 --> 00:09:01.124
Oh, Mirabel didn't get one.

153
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:06.755
You didn't get a Gift?

154
00:09:07.756 --> 00:09:10.008
Mirabel! Delivery!

155
00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:13.595
I gave you the special since
you're the only Madrigal kid with no Gift.

156
00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:18.892
I call it the "Not Special Special"
since you have no Gift.

157
00:09:19.643 --> 00:09:20.519
Thanks.

158
00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:23.146
Oh, and tell Antonio good luck.

159
00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:25.566
The last Gift ceremony was a bummer.

160
00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:28.443
Last one being yours that did not work.

161
00:09:28.819 --> 00:09:32.573
If I was you, I'd be really sad.

162
00:09:33.115 --> 00:09:35.909
Well, my little friend, I am not.

163
00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:38.704
Because the truth is, Gift or no Gift...

164
00:09:38.871 --> 00:09:41.540
I am just as special
as the rest of my family.

165
00:09:41.707 --> 00:09:43.166
Who wants more pink?

166
00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:45.043
All right, guys, where do I drop the wagon?

167
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.921
Maybe your Gift is being in denial.

168
00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:49.256
I made a rainbow!

169
00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:51.758
Get the chairs out of the way.

170
00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:53.468
Sorry.
Excuse me.

171
00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:55.596
Dolores, can you hear
if anyone is gonna be late?

172
00:09:56.972 --> 00:09:59.266
Lift it higher.
Higher.

173
00:09:59.433 --> 00:10:00.976
-Hey, nice job over there.
-Yeah, yeah.

174
00:10:01.143 --> 00:10:03.020
Camilo, we need another José!

175
00:10:03.187 --> 00:10:04.188
José!

176
00:10:05.439 --> 00:10:07.482
Luisa, the piano goes upstairs!

177
00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:09.693
I'm on it!
Careful, sis!

178
00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:13.864
My baby's night has to be perfect,
and it's not perfect.

179
00:10:14.031 --> 00:10:15.157
And people are going to be coming.

180
00:10:15.324 --> 00:10:16.533
And nothing's ready.

181
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:17.743
The flowers!

182
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:21.413
Did someone say flowers?

183
00:10:21.622 --> 00:10:23.081
Isabela!

184
00:10:23.248 --> 00:10:25.542
Our angel, our angel!

185
00:10:25.709 --> 00:10:27.503
Please don't clap.

186
00:10:28.212 --> 00:10:30.172
-Thank you.
-Oh, it's nothing.

187
00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:33.258
A little sisterly advice...

188
00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:35.844
if you weren't always trying too hard,
you wouldn't be in the way.

189
00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:39.014
Actually, Isa, this is called helping.

190
00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:41.141
And I'm not in the way.
You are.

191
00:10:45.187 --> 00:10:46.188
Excuse me.

192
00:10:46.355 --> 00:10:49.107
<i>Mi vida</i>, you okay?
You don't have to overdo it.

193
00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:50.317
I know, <i>Mamá.</i>

194
00:10:50.484 --> 00:10:53.529
I just wanna do my part
like the rest of the family.

195
00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:54.947
She's right, <i>amor.</i>

196
00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:57.574
First Gift ceremony since yours.
A lot of emotions.

197
00:10:57.741 --> 00:10:59.618
-Bee stings!
-And I've been there.

198
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.205
When me and your <i>tío </i>Félix
married into the family...

199
00:11:03.664 --> 00:11:06.959
outsiders who had no Gift,
never, ever would...

200
00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:10.796
surrounded by the exceptional,
it was easy to feel...

201
00:11:10.963 --> 00:11:12.089
un-ceptional.

202
00:11:12.256 --> 00:11:13.257
Okay, <i>Papi.</i>

203
00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:14.466
-I'm just saying, I get it.
-Eat.

204
00:11:14.633 --> 00:11:16.343
<i>Mi amor,</i> if you ever wanna talk...

205
00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:20.055
I gotta put out the stuff.
The house isn't gonna decorate itself.

206
00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:22.808
Sorry, you could. You look great.

207
00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:25.143
<i>-Corazón,</i> remember!
-Yeah, remember!

208
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.479
-You have nothing to prove!
-You have nothing to prove!

209
00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:37.573
{\an8}-You guys can set up over here.
-Clean your rooms!

210
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:39.700
I don't care how big they are.

211
00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:42.369
Has anybody seen my <i>tiple?</i>

212
00:11:46.832 --> 00:11:47.666
One hour!

213
00:11:49.877 --> 00:11:51.128
No, no, no!

214
00:11:51.295 --> 00:11:55.382
Maybe you should leave the decorations
to someone else?

215
00:11:55.549 --> 00:11:58.969
No, I actually made these
as a surprise for you.

216
00:12:01.513 --> 00:12:04.600
Mirabel, I know you want to help.

217
00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:07.352
But tonight must go perfectly.

218
00:12:07.978 --> 00:12:12.566
The whole town relies on our family,
on our Gifts.

219
00:12:12.733 --> 00:12:18.947
So, the best way for some of us to help
is to step aside.

220
00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:22.492
Let the rest of the family
do what they do best.

221
00:12:23.577 --> 00:12:24.578
Okay?

222
00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:26.455
Mm-hmm.

223
00:12:27.998 --> 00:12:30.876
-Pepa! You have a cloud!
-I know, <i>Mamá.</i>

224
00:12:31.043 --> 00:12:34.713
But now I can't find Antonio.
What do you want from me?

225
00:12:36.381 --> 00:12:38.592
<i>Mamá,</i> be nice to Mirabel, okay?

226
00:12:38.759 --> 00:12:40.886
You know tonight will be hard for her.

227
00:12:41.553 --> 00:12:44.556
If the Gift ceremony doesn't go well
this time...

228
00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:47.059
tonight will be hard for us all.

229
00:12:53.232 --> 00:12:54.358
Antonio!

230
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:06.328
Everyone's looking for you.

231
00:13:09.748 --> 00:13:12.793
This present will self-destruct
if you don't take it...

232
00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:14.670
in three...

233
00:13:14.837 --> 00:13:16.588
two...

234
00:13:16.755 --> 00:13:18.340
one...

235
00:13:24.847 --> 00:13:26.056
Nervous?

236
00:13:27.641 --> 00:13:30.185
You have nothing to worry about.

237
00:13:30.352 --> 00:13:32.312
You're gonna get your Gift
and open that door...

238
00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:35.816
and it's gonna be the coolest ever.

239
00:13:35.983 --> 00:13:37.484
I know it.

240
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:41.697
What if it doesn't work?

241
00:13:43.115 --> 00:13:46.827
Well, in that impossible scenario...

242
00:13:46.994 --> 00:13:50.873
you'd stay here in the nursery with me.

243
00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:52.624
Forever.

244
00:13:52.791 --> 00:13:55.085
And I'd get you all to myself.

245
00:13:56.295 --> 00:13:59.381
I wish you could have a door.

246
00:14:02.134 --> 00:14:03.719
You know what?

247
00:14:03.886 --> 00:14:06.388
You don't have to worry about me...

248
00:14:06.555 --> 00:14:09.349
'cause I have an amazing family...

249
00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:11.894
and an amazing house.

250
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.646
And an amazing you.

251
00:14:15.647 --> 00:14:20.027
And seeing you get your special Gift
and your door...

252
00:14:20.194 --> 00:14:23.655
that's gonna make me
way more happy than anything.

253
00:14:25.449 --> 00:14:30.913
But, alas, I am gonna miss
having the world's best roomie.

254
00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:40.380
I know you're an animal guy...

255
00:14:40.547 --> 00:14:44.343
and I made this so,
when you move into your cool, new room...

256
00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.970
you always have something to snuggle with.

257
00:14:57.231 --> 00:14:59.983
All right, <i>hombrecito,</i> you ready?

258
00:15:01.527 --> 00:15:03.529
Sorry, I got to get one more squeeze.

259
00:15:05.906 --> 00:15:07.157
Okay, okay, we're going!

260
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:25.968
Here you go!

261
00:15:36.937 --> 00:15:38.480
Cecilia, up top!

262
00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:32.868
There you are.

263
00:16:33.035 --> 00:16:35.454
Look at you! All grown up.

264
00:16:35.621 --> 00:16:37.873
Pepi, <i>amor, </i>you're gonna get him all wet.

265
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.083
You are making your papa proud.

266
00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:41.376
I don't sound like that.

267
00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:42.711
I don't sound like that.

268
00:16:42.878 --> 00:16:44.755
<i>Abuela</i> says it's time.

269
00:16:45.881 --> 00:16:47.591
We'll be waiting at your door.

270
00:16:47.758 --> 00:16:48.592
Okay, okay.

271
00:16:49.218 --> 00:16:50.052
Okay, okay.

272
00:16:50.719 --> 00:16:51.929
All right, I'm done!

273
00:17:01.063 --> 00:17:03.273
Fifty years ago...

274
00:17:04.358 --> 00:17:07.152
in our darkest moment...

275
00:17:08.028 --> 00:17:11.281
this candle blessed us with a miracle.

276
00:17:11.865 --> 00:17:14.409
And the greatest honor of our family...

277
00:17:14.576 --> 00:17:20.540
has been to use our blessings
to serve this beloved community.

278
00:17:21.124 --> 00:17:24.461
Tonight, we come together once more...

279
00:17:24.627 --> 00:17:27.839
as another steps into the light...

280
00:17:28.464 --> 00:17:30.467
to make us proud.

281
00:18:01.164 --> 00:18:02.416
I can't.

282
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.128
I need you.

283
00:18:19.892 --> 00:18:23.103
Come on, let's get you to your door.

284
00:19:28.252 --> 00:19:32.965
Will you use your Gift
to honor our miracle?

285
00:19:33.423 --> 00:19:35.884
Will you serve this community...

286
00:19:36.051 --> 00:19:38.428
and strengthen our home?

287
00:20:11.295 --> 00:20:12.880
I understand you.

288
00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:18.218
Of course they can come!

289
00:20:40.616 --> 00:20:42.784
We have a new Gift!

290
00:21:01.178 --> 00:21:03.764
It's bigger on the inside?

291
00:21:11.813 --> 00:21:13.357
Antonio!

292
00:21:16.318 --> 00:21:18.487
You wanna go where?

293
00:21:45.222 --> 00:21:47.808
-That was great!
-Okay! All right!

294
00:21:48.809 --> 00:21:50.686
That was amazing.

295
00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:54.648
I knew you could do it!

296
00:21:54.815 --> 00:21:58.819
A Gift just as special as you.

297
00:22:02.197 --> 00:22:03.407
We need a picture!

298
00:22:03.574 --> 00:22:06.285
Everyone! Come, come, come!

299
00:22:06.827 --> 00:22:10.455
It's a great night! It's a perfect night!

300
00:22:12.165 --> 00:22:13.625
Everyone, together!

301
00:22:14.126 --> 00:22:16.962
<i>La Familia Madrigal!</i>

302
00:22:28.807 --> 00:22:32.186
<i>Don't be upset or mad at all</i>

303
00:22:34.396 --> 00:22:37.524
<i>Don't feel regret or sad at all</i>

304
00:22:38.942 --> 00:22:42.779
<i>Hey, I'm still a part
of the family Madrigal</i>

305
00:22:42.946 --> 00:22:46.700
<i>And I'm fine
I am totally fine</i>

306
00:22:46.867 --> 00:22:50.996
<i>I will stand on the side as you shine</i>

307
00:22:52.206 --> 00:22:56.460
<i>I'm not fine
I'm not fine</i>

308
00:22:56.710 --> 00:23:00.088
<i>I can't move the mountains</i>

309
00:23:00.255 --> 00:23:03.842
<i>I can't make flowers bloom</i>

310
00:23:04.051 --> 00:23:08.722
<i>I can't take another night up in my room</i>

311
00:23:08.889 --> 00:23:11.642
<i>Waiting on a miracle</i>

312
00:23:11.808 --> 00:23:15.270
<i>I can't heal what's broken</i>

313
00:23:15.437 --> 00:23:19.149
<i>Can't control the morning rain or a hurricane</i>

314
00:23:19.316 --> 00:23:23.737
<i>Can't keep down the unspoken invisible pain</i>

315
00:23:23.904 --> 00:23:26.949
<i>Always waiting on a miracle
A miracle</i>

316
00:23:27.115 --> 00:23:30.744
<i>Always walking alone</i>

317
00:23:31.036 --> 00:23:34.623
<i>Always wanting for more</i>

318
00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:39.294
<i>Like I'm still at that door
Longing to shine</i>

319
00:23:39.461 --> 00:23:42.214
<i>Like all of you shine</i>

320
00:23:42.381 --> 00:23:45.884
<i>All I need is a change</i>

321
00:23:46.051 --> 00:23:49.638
<i>All I need is a chance</i>

322
00:23:49.847 --> 00:23:56.353
<i>All I know is I can't stay on the side
Open your eyes</i>

323
00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:00.941
<i>Open your eyes
Open your eyes</i>

324
00:24:01.149 --> 00:24:04.736
<i>I would move the mountains</i>

325
00:24:04.903 --> 00:24:08.740
<i>Make new trees and flowers grow</i>

326
00:24:08.907 --> 00:24:12.995
<i>Someone please just let me know where do I go</i>

327
00:24:13.161 --> 00:24:16.039
<i>I am waiting on a miracle
A miracle</i>

328
00:24:16.456 --> 00:24:19.376
<i>I would heal what's broken</i>

329
00:24:19.877 --> 00:24:23.755
<i>Show this family something new</i>

330
00:24:23.922 --> 00:24:28.051
<i>Who I am inside
So what can I do?</i>

331
00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:31.263
<i>I'm sick of waiting on a miracle
So here I go</i>

332
00:24:31.805 --> 00:24:35.225
<i>I am ready
Come on, I'm ready</i>

333
00:24:35.392 --> 00:24:39.271
<i>I've been patient and steadfast and steady</i>

334
00:24:39.438 --> 00:24:43.567
<i>Bless me now
As you blessed us all those years ago</i>

335
00:24:43.734 --> 00:24:47.946
<i>When you gave us a miracle</i>

336
00:24:49.615 --> 00:24:54.870
<i>Am I too late for a miracle?</i>

337
00:25:20.479 --> 00:25:21.438
<i>Casita?</i>

338
00:26:28.213 --> 00:26:29.756
Come on, <i>Abuela!</i>

339
00:26:33.135 --> 00:26:36.680
The house is in danger!
The house is in danger!

340
00:26:37.514 --> 00:26:40.601
The tiles were falling,
and there were cracks everywhere.

341
00:26:40.767 --> 00:26:42.477
And the candle almost went out.

342
00:26:45.105 --> 00:26:46.356
Show me.

343
00:26:50.027 --> 00:26:51.445
What?

344
00:26:53.614 --> 00:26:55.073
No, that's...

345
00:26:56.283 --> 00:26:58.118
The cracks were there.

346
00:26:59.203 --> 00:27:01.371
They were everywhere.

347
00:27:01.538 --> 00:27:04.791
The house was in trouble, the candle was...

348
00:27:05.792 --> 00:27:07.294
<i>Abuela</i>, I promise...

349
00:27:07.461 --> 00:27:08.504
That's enough.

350
00:27:11.173 --> 00:27:14.176
There is nothing wrong
with <i>La Casa Madrigal.</i>

351
00:27:14.343 --> 00:27:16.553
The magic is strong.

352
00:27:17.012 --> 00:27:18.972
And so are the drinks.

353
00:27:19.223 --> 00:27:21.225
Please! Music!

354
00:27:35.864 --> 00:27:38.242
If it was all in my head,
how did I cut my hand?

355
00:27:38.617 --> 00:27:40.994
I would never ruin Antonio's night.

356
00:27:41.453 --> 00:27:43.080
Is that really what you think?

357
00:27:43.247 --> 00:27:46.875
What I think
is that today was very hard for you.

358
00:27:47.042 --> 00:27:48.210
That's...

359
00:27:49.002 --> 00:27:51.505
I was looking out for the family.

360
00:27:51.713 --> 00:27:55.008
And I might not be super strong like Luisa...

361
00:27:55.175 --> 00:27:58.512
or effortlessly perfect
like <i>señorita perfecta </i>Isabela...

362
00:27:58.679 --> 00:28:01.139
who's never even had a bad hair day, but...

363
00:28:02.432 --> 00:28:03.684
whatever.

364
00:28:09.189 --> 00:28:12.359
I wish you could see yourself the way I do.

365
00:28:12.526 --> 00:28:16.113
You are perfect just like this.

366
00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:20.367
You're just as special
as anyone else in this family.

367
00:28:22.202 --> 00:28:25.247
You just healed my hand
with an <i>arepa con queso.</i>

368
00:28:25.414 --> 00:28:30.043
I healed your hand
with my love for my daughter...

369
00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:31.920
with her wonderful brain...

370
00:28:32.421 --> 00:28:34.840
-and big heart, cool glasses...
-Stop!

371
00:28:35.007 --> 00:28:36.091
<i>Mamá!</i>

372
00:28:37.467 --> 00:28:39.636
I know what I saw.

373
00:28:44.975 --> 00:28:47.603
Mira, my brother Bruno
lost his way in this family.

374
00:28:49.479 --> 00:28:51.315
I don't want the same for you.

375
00:28:53.192 --> 00:28:54.443
Get some sleep.

376
00:28:55.319 --> 00:28:57.237
You'll feel better tomorrow.

377
00:29:42.324 --> 00:29:44.159
Pedro.

378
00:29:45.452 --> 00:29:47.037
I need you.

379
00:29:48.413 --> 00:29:50.499
Cracks in our<i> casita.</i>

380
00:29:52.459 --> 00:29:56.547
If our family knew
how vulnerable we truly are...

381
00:29:58.173 --> 00:30:00.759
If our miracle is dying...

382
00:30:03.846 --> 00:30:07.349
We cannot lose our home again.

383
00:30:10.269 --> 00:30:11.937
Why is this happening?

384
00:30:14.106 --> 00:30:15.232
Open my eyes.

385
00:30:17.234 --> 00:30:21.488
If the answer is here, help me find it.

386
00:30:22.155 --> 00:30:25.242
Help me protect our family.

387
00:30:25.659 --> 00:30:29.538
Help me save our miracle.

388
00:30:39.006 --> 00:30:40.799
I will save the miracle.

389
00:30:48.807 --> 00:30:51.560
Wait. How do I save a miracle?

390
00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.648
I figure out what's happening
to the miracle.

391
00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:00.235
Oh, I have no idea.

392
00:31:00.402 --> 00:31:06.283
But there is one person in this family
who hears everything about everything.

393
00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:08.660
<i>So, if anyone would know what's wrong
with the magic...</i>

394
00:31:08.827 --> 00:31:09.661
Hey!

395
00:31:09.745 --> 00:31:10.579
<i>...it's her.</i>

396
00:31:10.787 --> 00:31:11.872
Dolores, hey.

397
00:31:12.039 --> 00:31:13.916
You know, out of all my older cousins,
you're, like, my favorite cousin...

398
00:31:14.082 --> 00:31:15.417
so I feel like I can talk to you
about anything...

399
00:31:15.584 --> 00:31:17.252
ergo you can talk to me about anything.

400
00:31:17.419 --> 00:31:20.380
Like the problem with the magic last night
that no one seemed to worry about...

401
00:31:20.547 --> 00:31:22.883
but maybe you heard about
that maybe I should know about.

402
00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:26.470
Camilo! Stop pretending you're Dolores
so you can have seconds.

403
00:31:27.346 --> 00:31:28.472
Worth a shot.

404
00:31:31.517 --> 00:31:34.353
The only one worried about the magic
is you...

405
00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.438
and the rats talking in the walls.

406
00:31:37.356 --> 00:31:40.984
And Luisa, I heard her eye twitching
all night.

407
00:31:43.362 --> 00:31:44.363
There we go.

408
00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:47.491
Everyone, to the table!
Let's go, let's go.

409
00:31:53.872 --> 00:31:55.541
-Luisa.
-Family.

410
00:31:55.958 --> 00:32:02.172
We are all thankful
for Antonio's wonderful new Gift.

411
00:32:02.339 --> 00:32:04.383
I told them to warm up your seat.

412
00:32:04.591 --> 00:32:06.510
Thank you, Toñito.

413
00:32:06.677 --> 00:32:09.972
I'm sure today we'll find a way
to put your blessings to good use.

414
00:32:10.138 --> 00:32:12.140
Luisa, Dolores says
you're totally freaking out.

415
00:32:12.349 --> 00:32:14.810
Any chance you maybe know something
about last night with the magic...

416
00:32:15.143 --> 00:32:16.311
-You do!
-Mirabel!

417
00:32:16.937 --> 00:32:18.605
-If you can't pay attention, I will help you.
-Actually...

418
00:32:18.772 --> 00:32:20.023
<i>Casita!</i>

419
00:32:22.401 --> 00:32:23.652
As I was saying...

420
00:32:24.486 --> 00:32:27.364
we must never take our miracle for granted...

421
00:32:28.031 --> 00:32:30.576
so today we will work twice as hard.

422
00:32:30.742 --> 00:32:32.578
-Mm-hmm. I will help Luisa.
-Stop.

423
00:32:33.745 --> 00:32:36.290
First, an announcement.

424
00:32:36.456 --> 00:32:40.961
I've spoken to the Guzmáns
about Mariano's proposal to Isabela.

425
00:32:41.128 --> 00:32:43.046
Dolores, do we have a date?

426
00:32:43.213 --> 00:32:45.883
Tonight. He wants five babies.

427
00:32:46.049 --> 00:32:47.259
Wonderful!

428
00:32:47.426 --> 00:32:51.054
Such a fine young man
with our perfect Isabela...

429
00:32:51.221 --> 00:32:54.683
will bring a new generation
of magical blessings...

430
00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:57.561
and make both of our families stronger.

431
00:33:00.147 --> 00:33:03.233
Okay. Our community is counting on us.

432
00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.402
<i>La Familia Madrigal!</i>

433
00:33:05.569 --> 00:33:06.862
<i>La Familia Madrigal!</i>

434
00:33:07.029 --> 00:33:08.030
<i>La Familia Madrigal!</i>

435
00:33:08.238 --> 00:33:09.781
Luisa, hey.
What?

436
00:33:13.619 --> 00:33:15.037
-Sorry.
-What is your problem?

437
00:33:15.204 --> 00:33:16.371
Hey! Luisa, hold up!

438
00:33:22.336 --> 00:33:24.922
-Luisa, can you re-route the river?
-Will do.

439
00:33:25.088 --> 00:33:27.841
-Luisa, the donkeys got out again.
-On it.

440
00:33:32.971 --> 00:33:33.805
Luisa!

441
00:33:34.431 --> 00:33:35.474
Wait a second!

442
00:33:36.225 --> 00:33:37.476
You gotta tell me about the magic.

443
00:33:37.643 --> 00:33:39.394
What's going on?
What are you hiding?

444
00:33:39.561 --> 00:33:43.315
Nothing. Just got a lot of chores,
so maybe you should just go home.

445
00:33:43.482 --> 00:33:45.317
Luisa, my house is leaning to the...

446
00:33:45.609 --> 00:33:47.819
Dolores said your eye was twitching,
and it never twitches.

447
00:33:47.986 --> 00:33:49.279
Something's making you nervous.

448
00:33:49.446 --> 00:33:51.907
Hey, move.
You're gonna make me drop a donkey.

449
00:33:52.324 --> 00:33:53.325
Luisa, will you just...

450
00:33:54.368 --> 00:33:56.787
-Just tell me what it is.
-There's nothing to tell.

451
00:33:56.954 --> 00:33:58.997
You're obviously worried
about something.

452
00:33:59.164 --> 00:34:01.083
Luisa, if you know
what's hurting the magic...

453
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:02.960
and it gets worse,
'cause you won't tell me what's wrong...

454
00:34:03.168 --> 00:34:04.586
Nothing's wrong!

455
00:34:06.004 --> 00:34:07.673
Wow, sorry.

456
00:34:08.382 --> 00:34:10.342
That snuck out there.
What I meant was...

457
00:34:10.717 --> 00:34:12.010
Why would anything be wrong?

458
00:34:12.344 --> 00:34:13.469
I'm totally fine.
The magic's fine.

459
00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:16.473
Luisa's fine.
I'm totally not nervous.

460
00:34:17.474 --> 00:34:19.101
Your eye is doing the thing...

461
00:34:19.268 --> 00:34:22.062
<i>I'm the strong one
I'm not nervous</i>

462
00:34:22.228 --> 00:34:24.565
<i>I'm as tough as the crust of the Earth is</i>

463
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.984
Okay.

464
00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:29.945
<i>I move mountains
I move churches</i>

465
00:34:30.112 --> 00:34:32.697
<i>And I glow 'cause I know what my worth is</i>

466
00:34:32.864 --> 00:34:35.074
Of course, I mean...
Hey, where are you going?

467
00:34:35.242 --> 00:34:37.953
<i>I don't ask how hard the work is</i>

468
00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:41.581
<i>Got a rough, indestructible surface
Diamonds and platinum</i>

469
00:34:41.748 --> 00:34:42.958
<i>I find 'em
I flatten 'em</i>

470
00:34:43.125 --> 00:34:45.710
<i>I take what I'm handed
I break what's demanded</i>

471
00:34:45.878 --> 00:34:51.300
<i>But under the surface, I feel berserk
As a tightrope walker in a three-ring circus</i>

472
00:34:51.466 --> 00:34:54.636
<i>Under the surface
Was Hercules ever like</i>

473
00:34:54.803 --> 00:34:56.597
<i>"Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus"</i>

474
00:34:56.763 --> 00:34:58.265
<i>Under the surface</i>

475
00:34:58.432 --> 00:35:01.768
<i>I'm pretty sure I'm worthless
If I can't be of service</i>

476
00:35:01.935 --> 00:35:03.187
<i>A flaw or a crack</i>

477
00:35:03.353 --> 00:35:05.564
<i>The straw in the stack
That breaks the camel's back</i>

478
00:35:05.731 --> 00:35:07.065
<i>What breaks the camel's back?</i>

479
00:35:07.232 --> 00:35:10.485
<i>It's pressure like a drip, drip, drip
That'll never stop</i>

480
00:35:10.986 --> 00:35:11.987
<i>Whoa</i>

481
00:35:12.654 --> 00:35:15.616
<i>Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip
Till you just go pop</i>

482
00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.701
<i>Whoa</i>

483
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:20.245
<i>Give it to your sister
Your sister's older</i>

484
00:35:20.412 --> 00:35:23.332
<i>Give her all the heavy things
We can't shoulder</i>

485
00:35:23.498 --> 00:35:27.211
<i>Who am I if I can't run with the ball?</i>

486
00:35:27.419 --> 00:35:31.548
<i>If I fall to pressure like a grip, grip, grip
And it won't let go</i>

487
00:35:32.257 --> 00:35:33.300
<i>Whoa</i>

488
00:35:34.051 --> 00:35:37.012
<i>Pressure like a tick, tick, tick
Till it's ready to blow</i>

489
00:35:37.721 --> 00:35:39.181
<i>Whoa</i>

490
00:35:39.348 --> 00:35:41.934
<i>Give it to your sister
Your sister's stronger</i>

491
00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.561
<i>See if she can hang on a little longer</i>

492
00:35:44.728 --> 00:35:47.940
<i>Who am I if I can't carry it all?</i>

493
00:35:48.106 --> 00:35:49.900
<i>If I falter</i>

494
00:35:50.067 --> 00:35:51.401
<i>Under the surface</i>

495
00:35:51.568 --> 00:35:55.447
<i>I hide my nerves and it worsens
I worry something is gonna hurt us</i>

496
00:35:55.614 --> 00:35:57.032
<i>Under the surface</i>

497
00:35:57.199 --> 00:36:00.744
<i>The ship doesn't swerve
As it heard how big the iceberg is</i>

498
00:36:00.911 --> 00:36:03.830
<i>Under the surface
I think about my purpose</i>

499
00:36:03.997 --> 00:36:07.125
<i>Can I somehow preserve this?
Line up the dominos</i>

500
00:36:07.292 --> 00:36:09.920
<i>A light wind blows
You try to stop it topplin'</i>

501
00:36:10.087 --> 00:36:12.130
<i>But on and on it goes
But wait</i>

502
00:36:13.048 --> 00:36:15.050
<i>If I could shake</i>

503
00:36:15.717 --> 00:36:19.847
<i>The crushing weight of expectations</i>

504
00:36:20.013 --> 00:36:23.350
<i>Would that free some room up for joy</i>

505
00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:25.894
<i>Or relaxation?</i>

506
00:36:26.395 --> 00:36:30.983
<i>Or a simple pleasure
Instead we measure</i>

507
00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:37.030
<i>This growing pressure keeps growing</i>

508
00:36:37.197 --> 00:36:43.245
<i>Keep going 'cause all we know is</i>

509
00:36:43.412 --> 00:36:46.874
<i>Pressure like a drip, drip, drip
That'll never stop</i>

510
00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.041
<i>Whoa</i>

511
00:36:48.792 --> 00:36:52.004
<i>Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip
Till you just go pop</i>

512
00:36:52.421 --> 00:36:53.881
<i>Whoa</i>

513
00:36:54.047 --> 00:36:56.175
<i>Give it to your sister
It doesn't hurt</i>

514
00:36:56.341 --> 00:36:59.178
<i>And see if she can handle every family burden</i>

515
00:36:59.386 --> 00:37:02.723
<i>Watch as she buckles
And bends but never breaks</i>

516
00:37:04.516 --> 00:37:06.018
<i>No mistakes</i>

517
00:37:06.185 --> 00:37:09.188
<i>Just pressure like a grip, grip, grip
And it won't let go</i>

518
00:37:09.438 --> 00:37:10.689
<i>Whoa</i>

519
00:37:11.481 --> 00:37:14.484
<i>Pressure like a tick, tick, tick
Till it's ready to blow</i>

520
00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:16.486
<i>Whoa</i>

521
00:37:16.653 --> 00:37:19.323
<i>Give it to your sister and never wonder</i>

522
00:37:19.531 --> 00:37:21.950
<i>If the same pressure
Would have pulled you under</i>

523
00:37:22.117 --> 00:37:25.120
<i>Who am I if I don't have what it takes?</i>

524
00:37:25.287 --> 00:37:28.332
<i>No cracks
No breaks</i>

525
00:37:28.498 --> 00:37:30.334
<i>No mistakes
No pressure</i>

526
00:37:39.384 --> 00:37:42.679
I think you're carrying way too much...

527
00:37:44.014 --> 00:37:46.183
Maybe I overdo it.

528
00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:47.643
Yep.

529
00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:50.771
There is something you should know.

530
00:37:50.938 --> 00:37:53.649
Last night, when you saw the cracks...

531
00:37:53.941 --> 00:37:56.693
I felt... weak.

532
00:37:57.528 --> 00:37:58.779
What?

533
00:37:58.946 --> 00:38:01.031
-Luisa! The donkeys!
-On it!

534
00:38:01.198 --> 00:38:02.783
Wait, wait, wait.
What do you mean?

535
00:38:03.116 --> 00:38:04.493
What do you think's hurting the magic?

536
00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:07.204
Don't know, but I heard the grown-ups once.

537
00:38:07.371 --> 00:38:09.081
Before <i>Tío </i>Bruno left...

538
00:38:09.248 --> 00:38:11.917
he had, like, some terrible vision about it.

539
00:38:12.209 --> 00:38:14.837
<i>Tío </i>Bruno?
What was in his vision?

540
00:38:15.003 --> 00:38:17.673
No one knows.
They never found it.

541
00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:21.301
But if something's wrong with the magic,
start with Bruno's tower.

542
00:38:21.468 --> 00:38:22.678
Find that vision.

543
00:38:23.178 --> 00:38:26.765
Wait! How do you find a vision?
What am I even looking for?

544
00:38:27.766 --> 00:38:29.893
If you find it, you'll know.

545
00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.228
But be careful.

546
00:38:31.395 --> 00:38:34.356
That place is off limits for a reason.

547
00:38:35.816 --> 00:38:37.317
Such a perfect match.

548
00:38:37.484 --> 00:38:38.485
So perfect.

549
00:38:38.652 --> 00:38:40.612
And so good for the <i>encanto.</i>

550
00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.133
<i>Casita.</i>

551
00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:05.470
Can you turn off the sand?

552
00:39:08.807 --> 00:39:12.060
You can't help in here?

553
00:39:14.479 --> 00:39:15.647
I'll be fine.

554
00:39:16.315 --> 00:39:17.941
I need to do this.

555
00:39:18.108 --> 00:39:20.694
For you, for <i>Abuela...</i>

556
00:39:21.361 --> 00:39:23.197
maybe a little for me.

557
00:39:24.531 --> 00:39:26.992
"Find the vision, save the..."

558
00:39:49.473 --> 00:39:50.474
Oh, hello.

559
00:39:51.642 --> 00:39:53.101
Lot of stairs...

560
00:39:53.769 --> 00:39:55.687
but at least I'll have a friend.

561
00:39:55.854 --> 00:39:57.898
No. He flew away immediately.

562
00:39:59.691 --> 00:40:00.984
All right.

563
00:40:01.151 --> 00:40:03.403
<i>Welcome to the family Madrigal</i>

564
00:40:04.112 --> 00:40:06.990
<i>There's so many stairs in the casa Madrigal</i>

565
00:40:07.741 --> 00:40:13.121
<i>You think there would be another way to
Get so high 'cause we're magic, but no</i>

566
00:40:13.372 --> 00:40:15.457
Magical how many stairs fit in here!

567
00:40:15.624 --> 00:40:18.252
Bruno, your room is the worst!

568
00:40:28.887 --> 00:40:30.055
Come on...

569
00:40:33.976 --> 00:40:36.019
Okay, I can do this.

570
00:41:32.618 --> 00:41:33.869
Quitter!

571
00:41:47.257 --> 00:41:48.425
Empty.

572
00:42:20.499 --> 00:42:22.251
What's hurting the magic?

573
00:42:55.033 --> 00:42:56.493
Me.

574
00:44:02.768 --> 00:44:05.187
Where are you coming from in such a hurry?

575
00:44:05.354 --> 00:44:06.480
I'm sorry I was...

576
00:44:06.647 --> 00:44:08.190
What is in your hair?

577
00:44:08.857 --> 00:44:09.983
My Gift!

578
00:44:10.609 --> 00:44:12.486
-I'm losing my Gift!
-What?

579
00:44:12.653 --> 00:44:15.572
Mirabel and I were having
this little talk about me carrying too much.

580
00:44:15.739 --> 00:44:18.575
So, I tried not to carry so much,
but I realized it was putting me behind.

581
00:44:18.742 --> 00:44:20.410
And I knew I was gonna let everyone down.

582
00:44:20.577 --> 00:44:23.664
And I felt really bad,
so I was grabbing all the donkeys...

583
00:44:23.956 --> 00:44:27.251
but then when I went to throw
the donkeys in the barn, they were...

584
00:44:27.417 --> 00:44:29.127
heavy!

585
00:44:31.922 --> 00:44:34.716
What did you do?
What did you say to her?

586
00:44:34.925 --> 00:44:36.510
Nothing. I don't...

587
00:44:36.677 --> 00:44:42.140
Mirabel, I have to go get the Guzmáns
for Isabela's engagement.

588
00:44:42.933 --> 00:44:45.602
Stay away from Luisa
until I can talk to her.

589
00:44:45.769 --> 00:44:48.397
Tonight, we can't have any more problems.

590
00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:51.733
And whatever you're doing,
stop doing it.

591
00:45:01.326 --> 00:45:03.370
Why am I in your vision, Bruno?

592
00:45:05.622 --> 00:45:07.249
<i>Tía!</i> Jeez.

593
00:45:07.416 --> 00:45:09.334
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

594
00:45:09.668 --> 00:45:11.336
Shoo, shoo, shoo!

595
00:45:12.713 --> 00:45:14.590
I just wanted to get
the last of Toñito's things...

596
00:45:14.756 --> 00:45:17.801
and then I heard the name we do not speak.

597
00:45:18.343 --> 00:45:22.264
Great. Now I'm thundering,
and that thunder will lead to a drizzle...

598
00:45:22.431 --> 00:45:24.266
and a drizzle will lead to a sprinkle...

599
00:45:24.766 --> 00:45:27.477
Clear skies, clear skies.

600
00:45:28.896 --> 00:45:30.731
Clear skies.

601
00:45:32.274 --> 00:45:33.901
<i>Tía </i>Pepa<i>? If...</i>

602
00:45:35.736 --> 00:45:40.657
If he had a vision about someone,
what would it mean for them?

603
00:45:40.824 --> 00:45:42.534
We don't talk about Bruno.

604
00:45:42.701 --> 00:45:46.455
I know. It's just hypothetically,
if he saw you...

605
00:45:46.622 --> 00:45:49.499
Mirabel, please,
we need to get ready for the Guzmáns.

606
00:45:49.666 --> 00:45:52.836
I just wanna know if it was generally
positive or, like, less positive...

607
00:45:53.003 --> 00:45:54.713
-It was a nightmare!
-Félix!

608
00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.590
Hey, she needs to know, Pepi,
she needs to know.

609
00:45:56.757 --> 00:45:57.799
We don't talk about Bruno.

610
00:45:57.966 --> 00:46:00.385
He would see something terrible.
And then...

611
00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:03.138
Boom! It would happen.

612
00:46:03.305 --> 00:46:04.473
We don't talk about Bruno.

613
00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.266
What if you didn't understand what he saw?

614
00:46:06.433 --> 00:46:09.853
Then you better figure it out,
because it was coming for you.

615
00:46:10.437 --> 00:46:14.983
<i>We don't talk about Bruno-no-no-no</i>

616
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:18.862
<i>We don't talk about Bruno</i>

617
00:46:19.863 --> 00:46:22.324
<i>-But it was my wedding day
-It was our wedding day</i>

618
00:46:22.491 --> 00:46:26.245
<i>We were getting ready
And there wasn't a cloud in the sky</i>

619
00:46:26.411 --> 00:46:28.664
<i>No clouds allowed in the sky</i>

620
00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:32.376
<i>Bruno walks in
With a mischievous grin</i>

621
00:46:32.543 --> 00:46:33.710
<i>Thunder</i>

622
00:46:33.877 --> 00:46:35.921
<i>You're telling the story or am I?</i>

623
00:46:36.088 --> 00:46:37.881
<i>I'm sorry, mi vida
Go on</i>

624
00:46:38.215 --> 00:46:40.676
<i>Bruno says it looks like rain</i>

625
00:46:40.843 --> 00:46:42.594
<i>Why did he tell her?</i>

626
00:46:42.761 --> 00:46:44.930
<i>In doing so, he floods my brain</i>

627
00:46:45.138 --> 00:46:47.307
<i>Abuela gets the umbrella</i>

628
00:46:47.474 --> 00:46:49.852
<i>Married in a hurricane</i>

629
00:46:50.018 --> 00:46:52.479
<i>What a joyous day
But anyway</i>

630
00:46:52.646 --> 00:46:57.067
<i>We don't talk about Bruno-no-no-no</i>

631
00:46:57.234 --> 00:47:00.404
<i>We don't talk about Bruno</i>

632
00:47:00.571 --> 00:47:01.446
<i>Hey</i>

633
00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:03.532
<i>Grew to live in fear of
Bruno stuttering or stumbling</i>

634
00:47:03.699 --> 00:47:05.868
<i>I can always hear him sort of muttering
And mumbling</i>

635
00:47:06.034 --> 00:47:08.871
<i>I associate him with
The sound of falling sand</i>

636
00:47:10.539 --> 00:47:12.875
<i>It's a heavy lift with a Gift so humbling</i>

637
00:47:13.041 --> 00:47:15.294
<i>Always left Abuela and the family fumbling</i>

638
00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:18.172
<i>Grappling with prophecies
They couldn't understand</i>

639
00:47:18.338 --> 00:47:19.631
<i>Do you understand?</i>

640
00:47:19.798 --> 00:47:23.969
<i>Seven-foot frame
Rats along his back</i>

641
00:47:24.136 --> 00:47:28.599
<i>When he calls your name
It all fades to black</i>

642
00:47:28.765 --> 00:47:32.936
<i>Yeah, he sees your dreams
And feasts on your screams</i>

643
00:47:34.479 --> 00:47:38.859
<i>We don't talk about Bruno-no-no-no</i>

644
00:47:39.026 --> 00:47:43.155
<i>We don't talk about Bruno</i>

645
00:47:43.447 --> 00:47:47.075
<i>He told me my fish would die
The next day dead</i>

646
00:47:47.242 --> 00:47:48.243
<i>No, no</i>

647
00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:51.663
<i>He told me I'd grow a gut
And just like he said</i>

648
00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:54.666
-<i>No, no
</i>-<i>He said that all my hair would disappear</i>

649
00:47:54.833 --> 00:47:56.418
<i>Now look at my head</i>

650
00:47:56.585 --> 00:47:57.586
<i>No, no</i>

651
00:47:57.753 --> 00:48:01.215
<i>Your fate is sealed
When your prophecy is read</i>

652
00:48:01.924 --> 00:48:05.511
<i>He told me
That the life of my dreams</i>

653
00:48:05.677 --> 00:48:09.723
<i>Would be promised and someday be mine</i>

654
00:48:11.183 --> 00:48:14.811
<i>He told me that my power would grow</i>

655
00:48:14.978 --> 00:48:18.273
<i>Like the grapes that thrive on the vine</i>

656
00:48:18.982 --> 00:48:20.526
<i>Mariano's on his way</i>

657
00:48:20.692 --> 00:48:24.530
<i>He told me that the man of my dreams</i>

658
00:48:24.696 --> 00:48:27.157
<i>Would be just out of reach</i>

659
00:48:27.324 --> 00:48:29.826
<i>Betrothed to another</i>

660
00:48:30.285 --> 00:48:32.955
<i>-It's like I hear him now
-Hey, sis</i>

661
00:48:33.997 --> 00:48:37.292
<i>I want not a sound out of you</i>

662
00:48:37.751 --> 00:48:39.670
<i>I can hear him now</i>

663
00:48:39.837 --> 00:48:43.549
<i>Um, Bruno
Yeah, about that Bruno</i>

664
00:48:43.715 --> 00:48:48.262
<i>I really need to know about Bruno
Give me the truth and the whole truth, Bruno</i>

665
00:48:48.428 --> 00:48:51.098
<i>Isabela, your boyfriend's here!</i>

666
00:48:51.265 --> 00:48:53.267
<i>Time for dinner</i>

667
00:48:53.475 --> 00:48:56.895
<i>-It was my wedding day
-It was our wedding day</i>

668
00:48:57.145 --> 00:49:02.901
<i>-And there wasn't a cloud in the sky
-No clouds allowed in the sky</i>

669
00:49:02.985 --> 00:49:06.154
<i>He told me that my power would grow</i>

670
00:49:06.321 --> 00:49:09.616
<i>-Thunder
-You're telling the story or am I?</i>

671
00:49:09.825 --> 00:49:11.785
<i>Mariano's on his way</i>

672
00:49:11.952 --> 00:49:15.956
<i>-Bruno says it looks like rain
-Why did he tell her?</i>

673
00:49:16.123 --> 00:49:20.752
<i>-In doing so, he floods my brain
-Abuela gets the umbrella</i>

674
00:49:20.919 --> 00:49:23.755
<i>Married in a hurricane</i>

675
00:49:25.507 --> 00:49:28.302
<i>He's here
Don't talk about Bruno-no</i>

676
00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:31.138
<i>Why did I talk about Bruno?</i>

677
00:49:31.346 --> 00:49:33.098
<i>Not a word about Bruno</i>

678
00:49:33.265 --> 00:49:35.475
<i>I never should have brought up Bruno</i>

679
00:49:37.561 --> 00:49:40.397
Miraboo!
Got your party pants on? 'Cause I...

680
00:49:46.653 --> 00:49:48.989
I broke into Bruno's tower.

681
00:49:49.156 --> 00:49:50.616
I found his last vision.
The family's in trouble.

682
00:49:50.782 --> 00:49:52.826
The magic is dying. The house is breaking,
Luisa's gift is fading.

683
00:49:52.993 --> 00:49:55.829
And I think it's all because of me?

684
00:49:59.333 --> 00:50:00.417
<i>Pá?</i>

685
00:50:03.921 --> 00:50:06.965
We say nothing.
<i>Abuela </i>wants tonight to be perfect.

686
00:50:07.132 --> 00:50:09.760
Until the Guzmáns leave,
you did not break into Bruno's tower.

687
00:50:09.927 --> 00:50:11.929
The magic is not dying.
The house is not breaking.

688
00:50:12.095 --> 00:50:13.639
Luisa's gift is not fading.

689
00:50:13.805 --> 00:50:16.433
No one will know.
Just act normal.

690
00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:18.852
No one has to know.

691
00:50:21.813 --> 00:50:23.440
I know.

692
00:50:25.442 --> 00:50:26.652
She's gonna tell everyone.

693
00:50:26.818 --> 00:50:28.529
Time to eat!

694
00:50:30.072 --> 00:50:34.868
The Guzmáns and the Madrigals together
will be so good for the <i>encanto.</i>

695
00:50:35.035 --> 00:50:39.331
Yes. Then, let's hope
tonight is not a horrible disaster.

696
00:50:40.082 --> 00:50:41.834
To a perfect night!

697
00:50:51.552 --> 00:50:52.970
Avocado?

698
00:50:58.559 --> 00:51:00.769
Camilo. Fix your face.

699
00:51:01.937 --> 00:51:02.938
Water?

700
00:51:07.943 --> 00:51:08.819
Mirabel.

701
00:51:09.987 --> 00:51:11.572
The cream, please?

702
00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:13.407
<i>Pá,</i> the cream?

703
00:51:17.077 --> 00:51:18.495
...Bruno's vision.

704
00:51:19.246 --> 00:51:21.331
Pepa, the cloud.

705
00:51:21.498 --> 00:51:23.876
Clear skies, clear skies, clear skies.

706
00:51:25.127 --> 00:51:27.045
Bruno's vision.

707
00:51:32.259 --> 00:51:33.343
Mirabel?

708
00:51:34.636 --> 00:51:35.846
Everything okay?

709
00:51:36.847 --> 00:51:39.057
Everything is great.
She's just excited.

710
00:51:39.224 --> 00:51:40.851
For you to propose.
Which you should do!

711
00:51:41.018 --> 00:51:42.644
-Yes.
-As fast as you can.

712
00:51:43.145 --> 00:51:44.646
I was actually gonna...

713
00:51:44.813 --> 00:51:46.523
You were actually gonna.
Great!

714
00:51:49.443 --> 00:51:52.446
Well, since everyone here has a talent...

715
00:51:52.613 --> 00:51:55.115
my Mariano wanted to
begin with a song!

716
00:51:55.282 --> 00:51:58.160
Luisa, could you bring over the piano?

717
00:51:58.827 --> 00:52:00.078
Okay.

718
00:52:01.788 --> 00:52:05.209
It's actually family tradition
to sing after.

719
00:52:07.503 --> 00:52:11.423
Isabela, most graceful of all the Madrigals.

720
00:52:14.301 --> 00:52:15.552
You're doing great.

721
00:52:15.886 --> 00:52:19.806
The most perfect flower
in this entire <i>encanto...</i>

722
00:52:19.973 --> 00:52:20.807
No!

723
00:52:29.525 --> 00:52:31.318
Will you marry...

724
00:52:31.485 --> 00:52:32.569
No!

725
00:52:36.448 --> 00:52:38.534
What is happening?

726
00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:40.160
Mirabel found Bruno's vision. She's in it.

727
00:52:40.327 --> 00:52:42.663
She's gonna destroy the magic and now,
we're all doomed!

728
00:53:12.776 --> 00:53:15.153
<i>Abuela,</i> please!
There's gotta be an explanation.

729
00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:16.613
I hate you!

730
00:53:16.822 --> 00:53:18.448
-I'm a loser!
-Luisa!

731
00:53:18.615 --> 00:53:19.700
What did you do?

732
00:53:19.867 --> 00:53:24.121
I'm not doing anything!
It's Bruno's vision!

733
00:53:30.002 --> 00:53:34.506
The magic is strong! Everything is fine!

734
00:53:34.673 --> 00:53:37.092
We are the Madrigals!

735
00:53:37.426 --> 00:53:38.802
Mirabel!

736
00:54:33.690 --> 00:54:34.775
Hey!

737
00:54:50.582 --> 00:54:53.836
It's okay, <i>mami.
</i>Deep breath in, deep breath out.

738
00:54:57.673 --> 00:54:58.549
Stop!

739
00:55:00.759 --> 00:55:02.010
Stop!

740
00:55:24.992 --> 00:55:26.618
No! No!

741
00:55:26.785 --> 00:55:28.912
Help! Help...

742
00:55:29.204 --> 00:55:31.248
<i>Casita! Casita!</i>

743
00:55:32.416 --> 00:55:33.584
Help me!

744
00:55:34.001 --> 00:55:35.002
Help me!

745
00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:41.383
You're very sweaty.

746
00:55:45.888 --> 00:55:46.722
Oh, no!

747
00:56:00.611 --> 00:56:01.862
-Bye.
-What?

748
00:56:02.029 --> 00:56:03.614
No.
Hold on!

749
00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:05.115
Wait! Wait!

750
00:56:05.866 --> 00:56:06.992
Why did you take the vision?

751
00:56:07.159 --> 00:56:08.243
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.
Knock on wood.

752
00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:09.661
What does it mean?

753
00:56:09.828 --> 00:56:11.830
Is it why you came back or...?

754
00:56:12.706 --> 00:56:13.665
<i>Tío </i>Bruno?

755
00:56:13.832 --> 00:56:15.584
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.
Knock on wood.

756
00:56:15.834 --> 00:56:18.921
You were never supposed to see that vision.
No one was.

757
00:56:19.087 --> 00:56:20.923
-But...
-A little salt.

758
00:56:22.216 --> 00:56:23.217
Sugar.

759
00:56:28.639 --> 00:56:29.473
Wait.

760
00:56:30.265 --> 00:56:33.227
Have you been in here patching the cracks?

761
00:56:34.186 --> 00:56:37.439
Oh, that? No, no, no.
I'm too scared to go near those things.

762
00:56:37.606 --> 00:56:39.650
All the patching's done by Hernando.

763
00:56:39.816 --> 00:56:43.278
-Who is Hernando?
-I'm Hernando and I'm scared of nothing!

764
00:56:45.113 --> 00:56:46.615
It's actually me.

765
00:56:47.074 --> 00:56:48.992
I used to say my real Gift was "acting."

766
00:56:50.911 --> 00:56:53.539
I'm Jorge. I make the spackle.

767
00:56:55.666 --> 00:56:58.627
How long have you been back here?

768
00:57:04.216 --> 00:57:05.759
You never left.

769
00:57:06.802 --> 00:57:10.097
Well, I left my tower, which was,
you know, a lot of stairs...

770
00:57:10.264 --> 00:57:12.850
and here, kitchen adjacent.

771
00:57:14.810 --> 00:57:17.020
Plus, free entertainment.

772
00:57:17.187 --> 00:57:19.106
So, what do you like?
You like sports?

773
00:57:19.565 --> 00:57:22.150
Game shows?
Telenovelas?

774
00:57:23.819 --> 00:57:26.280
Their love could never be.

775
00:57:26.446 --> 00:57:27.990
I don't understand.

776
00:57:28.156 --> 00:57:30.033
Well, because she's his aunt
and she has amnesia...

777
00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:32.077
so she can't remember that she's his aunt.

778
00:57:32.244 --> 00:57:34.746
It's like a very forbidden kind of...

779
00:57:34.913 --> 00:57:40.127
I don't understand why you left,
but didn't leave.

780
00:57:40.919 --> 00:57:45.591
Oh, well, because, the mountains
around the <i>encanto </i>are pretty tall.

781
00:57:45.757 --> 00:57:49.636
And like I said, free food and everything.

782
00:57:49.803 --> 00:57:51.889
You guys love the free food, don't ya?

783
00:57:52.264 --> 00:57:54.641
Always hungry.
Never satisfied.

784
00:58:15.245 --> 00:58:18.123
My Gift wasn't helping the family...

785
00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:20.918
but, I love my family, you know?

786
00:58:21.543 --> 00:58:25.255
I just don't know how to...

787
00:58:25.881 --> 00:58:28.342
Well, anyway,
I think you should go, because...

788
00:58:28.550 --> 00:58:30.677
I don't really have a good reason,
but, if I did, you'd be like...

789
00:58:30.886 --> 00:58:32.596
"I should go, because that's a good reason."

790
00:58:34.598 --> 00:58:35.807
Why was I in your vision?

791
00:58:38.268 --> 00:58:39.645
<i>Tío </i>Bruno?

792
00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:45.984
I just wanted to make the family proud of me.

793
00:58:46.527 --> 00:58:47.778
Just once.

794
00:58:49.905 --> 00:58:51.740
But if I should stop...

795
00:58:53.283 --> 00:58:55.619
if I'm hurting my family...

796
00:58:56.495 --> 00:58:58.372
just tell me.

797
00:58:59.498 --> 00:59:01.041
I can't tell you...

798
00:59:01.959 --> 00:59:03.877
because I don't know.

799
00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:09.049
I had this vision the night
that you didn't get your Gift.

800
00:59:09.967 --> 00:59:11.552
Abuela <i>worried about the magic.</i>

801
00:59:11.718 --> 00:59:15.556
<i>So, she begged me to look into the future.
See what it meant.</i>

802
00:59:17.057 --> 00:59:20.269
<i>And I saw the magic in danger.</i>

803
00:59:21.144 --> 00:59:24.231
<i>Our house breaking.</i>

804
00:59:24.398 --> 00:59:28.235
<i>And then, and then, and then, I saw you.</i>

805
00:59:28.402 --> 00:59:31.989
<i>But the vision was different.
It would change.</i>

806
00:59:32.155 --> 00:59:35.409
<i>And there was no one answer.
No clear fate.</i>

807
00:59:35.576 --> 00:59:38.537
<i>Like your future was undecided.</i>

808
00:59:39.454 --> 00:59:41.874
<i>But I knew how it was gonna look.
I knew what everyone would think...</i>

809
00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:45.043
<i>because I'm Bruno
and everyone always assumes the worst, so...</i>

810
00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:48.297
<i>so...</i>

811
00:59:49.673 --> 00:59:54.553
You left to protect me?

812
00:59:55.762 --> 00:59:57.472
I don't know which way it'll go...

813
00:59:58.307 --> 00:59:59.558
but my guess...

814
00:59:59.725 --> 01:00:01.977
the family, the <i>encanto</i>...

815
01:00:02.352 --> 01:00:04.313
and the fate of the miracle itself...

816
01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.357
Well, it's all gonna come down to you.

817
01:00:09.985 --> 01:00:11.111
Or maybe I'm wrong.

818
01:00:11.278 --> 01:00:13.780
You know, it's a mystery.
That's why this vision is...

819
01:00:15.657 --> 01:00:19.203
Look, if I could help anymore, I would...

820
01:00:19.369 --> 01:00:21.413
but that's all I know.

821
01:00:21.747 --> 01:00:24.625
Good luck.
I wish I could've seen more.

822
01:00:25.918 --> 01:00:26.919
Yeah.

823
01:00:30.672 --> 01:00:32.132
Yeah.

824
01:00:32.925 --> 01:00:35.761
You wish you could have seen more,
so see more!

825
01:00:35.928 --> 01:00:37.888
Have another vision.

826
01:00:38.055 --> 01:00:40.432
No, no.
See, I don't do visions anymore.

827
01:00:40.599 --> 01:00:41.808
-But you could.
-But I won't.

828
01:00:41.975 --> 01:00:45.979
You can't say the weight of the world
is on your shoulders. The end.

829
01:00:46.146 --> 01:00:49.900
If our fate's up to me,
me says have another vision.

830
01:00:50.776 --> 01:00:52.027
Maybe it'll show me what to do.

831
01:00:52.194 --> 01:00:56.031
Look, even if I wanted to, which I don't,
you wrecked my vision cave.

832
01:00:56.198 --> 01:00:58.700
Which is a problem,
'cause I need a big open space.

833
01:00:58.867 --> 01:01:00.452
-We'll find one.
-Where?

834
01:01:00.619 --> 01:01:01.620
Use my room.

835
01:01:02.996 --> 01:01:05.874
The rats told me everything.
Don't eat those.

836
01:01:09.294 --> 01:01:14.174
Our family needs help,
and you need to get outta here.

837
01:01:31.024 --> 01:01:33.902
You should have told me
the second you saw the vision.

838
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:35.070
Think of the family.

839
01:01:35.279 --> 01:01:37.281
I was thinking of my daughter.

840
01:01:38.156 --> 01:01:39.700
Pepa, calm down.

841
01:01:39.867 --> 01:01:41.118
-I'm doing my best.
-Yes.

842
01:01:41.285 --> 01:01:42.911
You're lucky it's not a hurricane.

843
01:01:43.078 --> 01:01:46.540
<i>Mamá,</i> you've always been
too hard on Mirabel.

844
01:01:46.707 --> 01:01:48.125
Look around.

845
01:01:48.292 --> 01:01:53.338
We must protect our family, our e<i>ncanto.
</i>We cannot lose our home.

846
01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:59.011
People in town are becoming anxious
about the magic.

847
01:01:59.178 --> 01:02:00.429
They want to see you.

848
01:02:01.138 --> 01:02:03.724
Mirabel was in that vision for a reason.

849
01:02:04.975 --> 01:02:06.059
Find her.

850
01:02:11.732 --> 01:02:13.942
We might wanna hurry.

851
01:02:14.109 --> 01:02:16.320
You can't hurry the future.

852
01:02:19.031 --> 01:02:20.991
What if I show you something worse?

853
01:02:21.158 --> 01:02:23.619
If I see something that you don't like,
you're gonna be all...

854
01:02:23.785 --> 01:02:27.664
"Bruno makes bad things happen. Oh, he's
creepy and his vision killed my goldfish."

855
01:02:28.248 --> 01:02:30.459
I don't think you make bad things happen.

856
01:02:31.251 --> 01:02:35.422
Sometimes family weirdos
just get a bad rap.

857
01:02:36.215 --> 01:02:37.424
You can do this.

858
01:02:41.136 --> 01:02:42.179
For the nerves.

859
01:02:46.183 --> 01:02:49.686
I can do this. I can do this,
I can do this, I can do this.

860
01:03:23.887 --> 01:03:25.722
You might wanna hang on.

861
01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:02.551
It's just the same thing.
I gotta stop!

862
01:04:02.718 --> 01:04:07.264
No. I need to know which way it goes.
There's gotta be an answer.

863
01:04:07.431 --> 01:04:08.599
Something we're not seeing!

864
01:04:08.765 --> 01:04:10.350
You're looking at the same thing that I am.

865
01:04:10.642 --> 01:04:12.060
-If there was something else...
-There!

866
01:04:12.352 --> 01:04:13.604
Over there!

867
01:04:14.396 --> 01:04:15.272
Butterfly!

868
01:04:15.439 --> 01:04:16.940
Follow the butterfly!

869
01:04:22.404 --> 01:04:23.447
Where is that?

870
01:04:23.864 --> 01:04:25.782
It's all out of order.

871
01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:30.621
It's the candle.
The candle's getting brighter!

872
01:04:30.829 --> 01:04:33.290
-I think you're gonna help the candle!
-How?

873
01:04:33.665 --> 01:04:35.334
There's someone with you.

874
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:37.836
-And you fight her!
-What?

875
01:04:38.003 --> 01:04:39.588
Wait, no, no.
Is that a hug?

876
01:04:39.755 --> 01:04:40.756
Am I fighting or hugging?

877
01:04:41.757 --> 01:04:43.717
An embrace.
An embrace!

878
01:04:43.884 --> 01:04:45.886
To make the candle bright
you have to embrace her.

879
01:04:46.053 --> 01:04:47.346
Embrace who?

880
01:04:47.846 --> 01:04:48.931
Almost there.

881
01:04:49.097 --> 01:04:50.891
-Who is it?
-Almost there.

882
01:04:51.808 --> 01:04:52.809
I got it!

883
01:04:54.561 --> 01:04:56.104
Isabela?

884
01:05:01.276 --> 01:05:03.529
Your sister? That's great!

885
01:05:05.572 --> 01:05:06.782
Every time.

886
01:05:08.408 --> 01:05:11.078
Why would embracing Isabela
do anything?

887
01:05:11.245 --> 01:05:14.081
I don't know. Our family got a miracle.
How do you help a family miracle?

888
01:05:14.248 --> 01:05:15.249
You hug a sister.

889
01:05:15.415 --> 01:05:18.460
Mirabel?
Mirabel?

890
01:05:19.336 --> 01:05:21.463
Mirabel?

891
01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:23.590
Well, I think we're running out of time here.

892
01:05:23.757 --> 01:05:25.133
It's not gonna work.

893
01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:28.303
She won't hug me ever, okay?
She hates me!

894
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:30.931
Also, I don't know if you heard,
I ruined her proposal!

895
01:05:31.098 --> 01:05:33.600
-Plus, P.S., she is just annoying.
-Mirabel?

896
01:05:33.767 --> 01:05:35.477
-Of course it's Isabela!
-Mirabel?

897
01:05:35.644 --> 01:05:36.979
What's her problem with me anyway?

898
01:05:37.145 --> 01:05:38.397
She's the one with roses
coming out of her...

899
01:05:38.564 --> 01:05:39.731
Mirabel!

900
01:05:39.898 --> 01:05:41.400
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

901
01:05:41.567 --> 01:05:43.402
You see, you're missing the point.

902
01:05:43.819 --> 01:05:46.071
The fate of the family,
it's not up to her.

903
01:05:46.238 --> 01:05:47.614
It's up to you.

904
01:05:48.156 --> 01:05:51.493
You're exactly what this family needs.

905
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:54.371
You just have to see it.

906
01:05:55.414 --> 01:05:57.165
By yourself, after I leave.

907
01:05:58.250 --> 01:06:00.043
What, you're not coming?

908
01:06:01.211 --> 01:06:04.006
It was your vision, Mirabel. Not mine.

909
01:06:04.173 --> 01:06:05.591
You're afraid <i>Abuela </i>will see you.

910
01:06:05.757 --> 01:06:07.718
Yep. I mean, yes, that too.

911
01:06:09.928 --> 01:06:13.432
Hey, after you save the miracle, come visit.

912
01:06:14.391 --> 01:06:18.854
After I save the miracle,
I'm bringing you home.

913
01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:21.815
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.
Knock on wood.

914
01:06:34.328 --> 01:06:38.248
You got this.
Just gonna save the miracle.

915
01:06:39.166 --> 01:06:40.667
With a hug.

916
01:06:41.877 --> 01:06:44.671
Isa? Hey.

917
01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:48.425
I know we've had our issues...

918
01:06:48.592 --> 01:06:54.389
but I'm ready to be a better sister...
to you.

919
01:06:54.806 --> 01:06:57.100
So, we should just hug.

920
01:06:57.518 --> 01:06:59.853
Let's hug it out, huh?

921
01:07:00.979 --> 01:07:03.315
"Hug it out"?

922
01:07:04.358 --> 01:07:07.027
Luisa can't lift an empanada<i>...</i>

923
01:07:07.486 --> 01:07:11.406
Mariano's nose
looks like a smashed papaya!

924
01:07:11.949 --> 01:07:13.492
Have you lost your mind?

925
01:07:14.952 --> 01:07:17.955
Isa, I feel like you're upset.

926
01:07:18.121 --> 01:07:21.917
And you know what cures being upset?
A warm embrace.

927
01:07:22.417 --> 01:07:24.044
Get out.

928
01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:27.422
Everything was perfect.

929
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:29.800
<i>Abuela </i>was happy. The family was happy.

930
01:07:29.967 --> 01:07:35.764
You wanna be a better sister?
Apologize for ruining my life.

931
01:07:39.434 --> 01:07:43.021
Go on.
Apologize.

932
01:07:46.567 --> 01:07:47.776
I...

933
01:07:49.194 --> 01:07:50.529
am...

934
01:07:51.697 --> 01:07:52.698
sorry...

935
01:07:55.158 --> 01:07:58.287
-that your life is so great!
-Out.

936
01:07:58.453 --> 01:08:01.164
Wait!
Fine! I apologize!

937
01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:04.418
I wasn't trying to ruin your life!

938
01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:07.880
Some of us have bigger problems...

939
01:08:08.046 --> 01:08:10.549
you selfish, entitled princess!

940
01:08:10.716 --> 01:08:11.967
"Selfish"?

941
01:08:12.134 --> 01:08:16.889
I've been stuck being perfect
my whole entire life!

942
01:08:17.055 --> 01:08:20.850
And literally, the only thing you have ever
done for me is mess things up!

943
01:08:21.018 --> 01:08:24.479
Nothing is messed up!
You can still marry that big dumb hunk!

944
01:08:24.645 --> 01:08:28.524
I never wanted to marry him!
I was doing it for the family!

945
01:08:30.861 --> 01:08:32.279
Oh, my gosh.

946
01:08:32.738 --> 01:08:33.779
Isa...

947
01:08:33.947 --> 01:08:37.576
that is a very serious confession.

948
01:08:38.868 --> 01:08:40.412
Okay, get over here.

949
01:08:40.578 --> 01:08:41.705
Bring it in.

950
01:08:42.288 --> 01:08:43.165
Isa?

951
01:08:46.752 --> 01:08:49.296
<i>I just made something unexpected</i>

952
01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:54.301
<i>Something sharp
Something new</i>

953
01:08:54.468 --> 01:08:56.678
Isa? This is the part where we...

954
01:08:56.845 --> 01:09:00.682
<i>It's not symmetrical or perfect
But it's beautiful</i>

955
01:09:00.849 --> 01:09:04.810
<i>And it's mine
What else can I do?</i>

956
01:09:04.978 --> 01:09:06.354
<i>Wait
Bring it in, bring it in</i>

957
01:09:06.563 --> 01:09:08.857
<i>-Good talk, bring it in, bring it in
-What else can I do?</i>

958
01:09:09.066 --> 01:09:10.776
<i>Let's hug
Bring it in, bring it in</i>

959
01:09:10.943 --> 01:09:12.194
<i>Free hugs
Bring it in, bring it in</i>

960
01:09:12.402 --> 01:09:16.113
<i>I grow rows and rows of roses</i>

961
01:09:16.615 --> 01:09:20.452
<i>Flor de mayo by the mile</i>

962
01:09:20.618 --> 01:09:24.790
<i>I make perfect, practiced poses</i>

963
01:09:24.957 --> 01:09:28.752
<i>So much hides behind my smile</i>

964
01:09:28.919 --> 01:09:34.131
<i>What could I do if I just grew
What I was feeling in the moment?</i>

965
01:09:34.299 --> 01:09:36.134
<i>Do you know where you're going?</i>

966
01:09:36.635 --> 01:09:41.223
<i>What could I do if I just knew
It didn't need to be perfect?</i>

967
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:44.643
<i>It just needed to be
And they let me be</i>

968
01:09:44.810 --> 01:09:48.522
<i>A hurricane of jacarandás</i>

969
01:09:48.689 --> 01:09:51.399
-<i>Strangling figs, hanging vines
</i>-<i>Fig!</i>

970
01:09:51.899 --> 01:09:52.901
<i>This is fine</i>

971
01:09:53.068 --> 01:09:58.991
<i>Palma de cera fills the air
As I climb and I push through</i>

972
01:09:59.157 --> 01:10:01.410
<i>What else can I do?</i>

973
01:10:02.202 --> 01:10:05.873
<i>Can I deliver us a river of sundew?</i>

974
01:10:06.039 --> 01:10:09.835
<i>Careful, it's carnivorous
A little just won't do</i>

975
01:10:10.002 --> 01:10:13.297
<i>I wanna feel the shiver of something new</i>

976
01:10:13.964 --> 01:10:17.050
<i>I'm so sick of pretty
I want something true, don't you?</i>

977
01:10:17.217 --> 01:10:22.347
<i>You just seemed like your life's been a dream
Since the moment you opened your eyes</i>

978
01:10:22.514 --> 01:10:24.725
<i>How far do these roots go down?</i>

979
01:10:24.892 --> 01:10:28.020
<i>All I know are the blossoms you grow</i>

980
01:10:28.187 --> 01:10:30.689
<i>But it's awesome to see how
You rise</i>

981
01:10:30.856 --> 01:10:32.691
<i>-How far can I rise?
-How far can you rise?</i>

982
01:10:32.858 --> 01:10:36.820
<i>Through the roof to the skies
Let's go</i>

983
01:10:36.987 --> 01:10:40.324
<i>A hurricane of jacarandás</i>

984
01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:42.284
<i>-Strangling figs
-Go</i>

985
01:10:42.492 --> 01:10:44.870
<i>-Hanging vines
-Grow</i>

986
01:10:45.037 --> 01:10:50.876
<i>Palma de cera fills the air
As I climb and I push through</i>

987
01:10:51.043 --> 01:10:52.794
<i>What else?
What else?</i>

988
01:10:52.961 --> 01:10:57.549
<i>What can you do when you are
Deeply madly truly in the moment?</i>

989
01:10:57.716 --> 01:11:00.802
<i>Seize the moment
Keep going</i>

990
01:11:00.969 --> 01:11:05.015
<i>What can you do when you know
Who you want to be isn't perfect?</i>

991
01:11:05.265 --> 01:11:08.644
<i>-But I'll still be okay
-Hey, everybody clear the way</i>

992
01:11:08.810 --> 01:11:12.648
<i>-I'm coming through with tabebuia
-Tabebuia</i>

993
01:11:12.814 --> 01:11:14.525
<i>-Making waves
-Making waves</i>

994
01:11:14.733 --> 01:11:17.069
-<i>Changing minds
</i>-<i>You've changed mine</i>

995
01:11:17.236 --> 01:11:19.488
<i>The way is clearer 'cause you're here</i>

996
01:11:19.655 --> 01:11:23.033
<i>And well, I owe this all to you</i>

997
01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:24.952
<i>What else can I do?</i>

998
01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.037
<i>Show them what you can do</i>

999
01:11:27.204 --> 01:11:30.916
<i>-What else can I do?
-There's nothing you can't do</i>

1000
01:11:31.083 --> 01:11:34.545
<i>What else can I do?</i>

1001
01:11:36.463 --> 01:11:38.465
You're a bad influence.

1002
01:11:39.216 --> 01:11:41.218
What is going on?

1003
01:11:41.844 --> 01:11:44.012
<i>Abuela</i>? It's okay! Everything's...

1004
01:11:44.179 --> 01:11:45.889
We're gonna save the miracle.
The magic...

1005
01:11:46.056 --> 01:11:47.516
What are you talking about?

1006
01:11:47.683 --> 01:11:50.018
Look at our home! Look at your sister!

1007
01:11:50.185 --> 01:11:53.230
Please just...
Isabela wasn't happy.

1008
01:11:53.438 --> 01:11:55.566
Of course she isn't happy.
You ruined her proposal.

1009
01:11:55.732 --> 01:11:58.026
No, no, no.
She needed me to ruin her proposal.

1010
01:11:58.193 --> 01:11:59.695
And then we did all this!

1011
01:11:59.862 --> 01:12:00.988
And the candle burned brighter
and the cracks...

1012
01:12:01.154 --> 01:12:02.823
-Mirabel.
-That's why I'm in the vision!

1013
01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:04.241
I'm saving the miracle!

1014
01:12:04.408 --> 01:12:06.785
You have to stop, Mirabel!

1015
01:12:09.621 --> 01:12:11.790
The cracks started with you.

1016
01:12:12.374 --> 01:12:14.751
Bruno left because of you.

1017
01:12:14.918 --> 01:12:18.380
Luisa's losing her powers.
Isabela's out of control.

1018
01:12:18.547 --> 01:12:20.215
Because of you!

1019
01:12:20.382 --> 01:12:23.135
I don't know why you weren't given a Gift...

1020
01:12:23.302 --> 01:12:27.181
but it is not an excuse
for you to hurt this family.

1021
01:12:37.399 --> 01:12:42.154
I will never be good enough for you.

1022
01:12:43.197 --> 01:12:44.281
Will I?

1023
01:12:47.159 --> 01:12:50.454
No matter how hard I try.

1024
01:12:55.501 --> 01:12:59.671
No matter how hard any of us tries.

1025
01:13:00.631 --> 01:13:04.009
Luisa will never be strong enough.

1026
01:13:04.176 --> 01:13:07.221
Isabela won't be perfect enough.

1027
01:13:07.387 --> 01:13:10.224
Bruno left our family because
you only saw the worst in him.

1028
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:12.434
Bruno didn't care about this family.

1029
01:13:12.601 --> 01:13:13.977
He loves this family.

1030
01:13:14.144 --> 01:13:17.981
I love this family.
We all love this family.

1031
01:13:18.148 --> 01:13:19.900
You're the one that doesn't care.

1032
01:13:20.442 --> 01:13:23.028
-You're the one breaking our home.
-Don't you ever...

1033
01:13:23.195 --> 01:13:25.864
The miracle is dying, because of you.

1034
01:13:31.161 --> 01:13:32.204
No, no, no!

1035
01:13:33.956 --> 01:13:34.790
The candle!

1036
01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:43.257
<i>Casita! </i>Get me up there!

1037
01:13:55.853 --> 01:13:56.854
No!

1038
01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:04.361
No!

1039
01:14:17.165 --> 01:14:18.166
Careful, Antonio!

1040
01:14:19.209 --> 01:14:20.460
We gotta get out of here!

1041
01:14:20.627 --> 01:14:22.462
Mirabel! Mirabel!

1042
01:14:23.046 --> 01:14:25.424
Mirabel, we have to get out!

1043
01:14:36.435 --> 01:14:37.519
-Mirabel!
-Mirabel!

1044
01:14:37.686 --> 01:14:39.104
Mirabel, leave it!

1045
01:14:43.358 --> 01:14:46.653
Mirabel! The house is going to fall!

1046
01:14:49.364 --> 01:14:51.783
-Mirabel, get out!
-Mirabel!

1047
01:15:20.938 --> 01:15:21.980
No.

1048
01:15:32.908 --> 01:15:34.201
Mirabel!

1049
01:15:35.786 --> 01:15:38.121
Mirabel, are you hurt?

1050
01:15:41.291 --> 01:15:42.417
Mirabel!

1051
01:15:42.584 --> 01:15:44.044
Julieta, come quick!

1052
01:15:44.545 --> 01:15:45.546
Julieta!

1053
01:15:45.712 --> 01:15:48.090
Don't move.
I'll be right back.

1054
01:15:50.259 --> 01:15:52.469
How did this happen?

1055
01:15:52.636 --> 01:15:55.180
Here, let me help you.
Let me help you.

1056
01:15:55.347 --> 01:15:58.183
-Everyone okay?
-Antonio, don't cry, <i>papito.</i>

1057
01:15:58.433 --> 01:16:01.728
How is this possible? The <i>encanto's</i> broken.

1058
01:16:01.895 --> 01:16:03.146
What do we do now?

1059
01:16:03.355 --> 01:16:05.232
My powers. They're gone.

1060
01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:07.484
What about Antonio?
What is he gonna do?

1061
01:16:12.781 --> 01:16:14.616
Mirabel?

1062
01:16:15.242 --> 01:16:17.828
Mirabel!
Where's Mirabel?

1063
01:16:17.995 --> 01:16:19.162
Where is she?

1064
01:16:19.329 --> 01:16:20.581
Mirabel!

1065
01:16:21.748 --> 01:16:22.791
Mirabel?

1066
01:16:24.501 --> 01:16:25.711
Mirabel!

1067
01:16:37.639 --> 01:16:38.974
Mirabel?

1068
01:16:42.477 --> 01:16:43.562
Mirabel!

1069
01:16:45.939 --> 01:16:47.524
Mirabel!

1070
01:16:48.108 --> 01:16:49.902
They haven't found her yet?

1071
01:16:50.694 --> 01:16:52.696
-Mirabel!
-Mirabel!

1072
01:16:53.322 --> 01:16:54.823
Mirabel!

1073
01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:14.510
Mirabel.

1074
01:17:22.226 --> 01:17:24.061
I'm sorry.

1075
01:17:26.188 --> 01:17:28.482
I didn't want to hurt us.

1076
01:17:29.441 --> 01:17:31.652
I just wanted...

1077
01:17:32.444 --> 01:17:35.072
to be something I'm not.

1078
01:17:50.003 --> 01:17:53.632
I've never been able to come back here.

1079
01:17:56.385 --> 01:18:02.683
This river is where we were given
our miracle.

1080
01:18:04.810 --> 01:18:07.813
Where <i>Abuelo</i> Pedro...

1081
01:18:11.441 --> 01:18:14.570
I thought we would have a different life.

1082
01:18:15.904 --> 01:18:19.366
I thought I would be a different woman.

1083
01:20:46.930 --> 01:20:49.141
<i>I was given a miracle.</i>

1084
01:20:51.351 --> 01:20:53.604
<i>A second chance.</i>

1085
01:20:57.649 --> 01:21:00.652
<i>And I was so afraid to lose it...</i>

1086
01:21:03.572 --> 01:21:08.368
<i>that I lost sight of who our miracle was for.</i>

1087
01:21:11.371 --> 01:21:15.667
<i>And I am so sorry.</i>

1088
01:21:17.544 --> 01:21:21.131
<i>You never hurt our family, Mirabel.</i>

1089
01:21:22.674 --> 01:21:24.009
<i>We are broken...</i>

1090
01:21:28.305 --> 01:21:30.265
because of me.

1091
01:21:44.488 --> 01:21:46.114
<i>Abuela.</i>

1092
01:21:47.866 --> 01:21:49.826
I can finally see.

1093
01:21:54.164 --> 01:21:56.959
You lost your home.

1094
01:21:58.836 --> 01:22:01.296
Lost everything.

1095
01:22:03.131 --> 01:22:05.801
You suffered so much...

1096
01:22:05.968 --> 01:22:07.803
all alone...

1097
01:22:08.345 --> 01:22:11.598
so it would never happen again.

1098
01:22:13.725 --> 01:22:17.020
We were saved because of you.

1099
01:22:17.896 --> 01:22:21.775
We were given a miracle,
because of you.

1100
01:22:22.693 --> 01:22:26.613
We are a family,
because of you.

1101
01:22:27.406 --> 01:22:30.534
And nothing could ever be broken

1102
01:22:30.701 --> 01:22:34.496
that we can't fix... together.

1103
01:22:39.543 --> 01:22:42.462
I asked my Pedro for help.

1104
01:22:44.631 --> 01:22:46.175
Mirabel.

1105
01:22:48.343 --> 01:22:50.470
He sent me you.

1106
01:23:20.250 --> 01:23:22.044
She didn't do this!

1107
01:23:23.128 --> 01:23:25.047
She didn't do this!

1108
01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:28.592
I gave her a vision!

1109
01:23:30.469 --> 01:23:31.470
It was me!

1110
01:23:31.637 --> 01:23:34.014
I was, like, "Go!"
And she was, like...

1111
01:23:34.723 --> 01:23:36.058
She only wanted to help.

1112
01:23:36.225 --> 01:23:40.270
I don't care what you think of me,
but if you're too stubborn to...

1113
01:23:42.064 --> 01:23:43.315
<i>Brunito.</i>

1114
01:23:44.483 --> 01:23:48.904
I feel like I missed something important.

1115
01:23:49.696 --> 01:23:50.989
Come on.

1116
01:23:58.288 --> 01:24:01.333
What's happening? Where are we going?

1117
01:24:02.793 --> 01:24:04.127
Home.

1118
01:24:10.717 --> 01:24:12.344
It's her! I found her!

1119
01:24:12.511 --> 01:24:13.887
I found her!

1120
01:24:14.054 --> 01:24:16.098
She's back! She's back, she's back!

1121
01:24:27.150 --> 01:24:28.402
Mirabel!

1122
01:24:31.446 --> 01:24:32.656
Mirabel!

1123
01:24:34.074 --> 01:24:34.950
<i>Mamá.</i>

1124
01:24:36.034 --> 01:24:37.452
<i>Mi amor,</i> I was so worried.

1125
01:24:37.619 --> 01:24:39.162
We couldn't find you.

1126
01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:42.124
There were bees everywhere.

1127
01:24:44.042 --> 01:24:45.294
I'll be okay.

1128
01:24:46.670 --> 01:24:48.797
Not if we don't have a house.

1129
01:24:48.964 --> 01:24:51.466
What? We don't have a house.
I can't say we don't have a house?

1130
01:24:51.633 --> 01:24:53.051
What is that?
Not a house.

1131
01:25:01.185 --> 01:25:05.564
<i>Look at this home
We need a new foundation</i>

1132
01:25:05.731 --> 01:25:09.860
<i>It may seem hopeless
But we'll get by just fine</i>

1133
01:25:10.027 --> 01:25:14.406
<i>Look at this family
A glowing constellation</i>

1134
01:25:14.573 --> 01:25:19.369
<i>So full of stars
And everybody wants to shine</i>

1135
01:25:20.621 --> 01:25:25.125
<i>But the stars don't shine, they burn</i>

1136
01:25:25.501 --> 01:25:29.004
<i>And the constellations shift</i>

1137
01:25:30.005 --> 01:25:34.301
<i>I think it's time you learn</i>

1138
01:25:34.468 --> 01:25:37.721
<i>You're more than just your Gift</i>

1139
01:25:37.888 --> 01:25:41.350
<i>And I'm sorry I held on too tight</i>

1140
01:25:42.226 --> 01:25:46.146
<i>Just so afraid I'd lose you too</i>

1141
01:25:46.313 --> 01:25:49.942
<i>The miracle is not
Some magic that you've got</i>

1142
01:25:50.567 --> 01:25:51.818
<i>The miracle is you</i>

1143
01:25:51.985 --> 01:25:54.655
<i>Not some Gift
Just you</i>

1144
01:25:54.821 --> 01:25:56.156
<i>The miracle is you</i>

1145
01:25:56.323 --> 01:25:58.534
<i>All of you
All of you</i>

1146
01:25:58.909 --> 01:26:02.538
<i>Okay so
We gonna talk about Bruno?</i>

1147
01:26:02.704 --> 01:26:03.914
<i>That's Bruno?</i>

1148
01:26:04.081 --> 01:26:07.209
<i>Yeah
There's a lot to say about Bruno</i>

1149
01:26:07.376 --> 01:26:09.294
<i>I'll start, okay
Pepa, I'm sorry about your wedding</i>

1150
01:26:09.461 --> 01:26:10.462
<i>Didn't mean to be upsetting</i>

1151
01:26:10.629 --> 01:26:12.464
<i>That wasn't a prophecy
I could just see you were sweating</i>

1152
01:26:12.631 --> 01:26:14.508
<i>And I wanted you to know
That your bro loves you so</i>

1153
01:26:14.675 --> 01:26:16.385
<i>Let it in, let it out
Let it rain, let it snow</i>

1154
01:26:16.552 --> 01:26:17.386
<i>Let it go</i>

1155
01:26:17.553 --> 01:26:18.846
<i>That's what I'm always saying, bro</i>

1156
01:26:19.054 --> 01:26:20.639
<i>I got a lot of apologies I got to say</i>

1157
01:26:20.848 --> 01:26:22.975
<i>Hey, we're just happy that you're here, okay?</i>

1158
01:26:23.141 --> 01:26:24.935
<i>-Come into the light
-That trip was only a night</i>

1159
01:26:25.102 --> 01:26:27.271
<i>And no matter what happens
We're gonna find our way</i>

1160
01:26:27.437 --> 01:26:29.565
<i>Yo, I knew he never left
I heard him every day</i>

1161
01:26:32.693 --> 01:26:34.695
<i>What's that sound?</i>

1162
01:26:35.571 --> 01:26:37.739
<i>I think it's everyone in town</i>

1163
01:26:39.283 --> 01:26:40.117
<i>Hey</i>

1164
01:26:40.284 --> 01:26:44.246
<i>Lay down your load
Lay down your load</i>

1165
01:26:44.413 --> 01:26:48.000
<i>Roll me down the road
Roll me down the road</i>

1166
01:26:48.876 --> 01:26:52.296
<i>We have no Gifts
But we are many</i>

1167
01:26:53.046 --> 01:26:56.508
<i>And we'll do anything for you</i>

1168
01:26:56.675 --> 01:27:01.096
<i>It's a dream when we work as a team
You're so strong</i>

1169
01:27:01.263 --> 01:27:04.850
-<i>Yeah, but sometimes I cry
</i>-<i>So do I</i>

1170
01:27:05.017 --> 01:27:07.102
<i>I may not be as strong
But I'm getting wiser</i>

1171
01:27:07.269 --> 01:27:09.021
<i>Yeah, I need sunlight and fertilizer</i>

1172
01:27:09.188 --> 01:27:11.690
<i>Come on
Let's plant something new and watch it fly</i>

1173
01:27:11.857 --> 01:27:13.400
<i>Straight up to the sky</i>

1174
01:27:13.567 --> 01:27:15.152
<i>Let's go</i>

1175
01:27:15.319 --> 01:27:19.114
<i>The stars don't shine, they burn</i>

1176
01:27:19.281 --> 01:27:22.910
<i>The constellations glow</i>

1177
01:27:23.493 --> 01:27:27.039
<i>The seasons change in turn</i>

1178
01:27:27.748 --> 01:27:30.584
<i>Would you watch our little girl go</i>

1179
01:27:30.751 --> 01:27:33.003
<i>She takes after you</i>

1180
01:27:34.421 --> 01:27:36.965
<i>Hey, Mariano
Why so blue?</i>

1181
01:27:38.050 --> 01:27:41.887
<i>I just have so much love inside</i>

1182
01:27:42.888 --> 01:27:46.892
<i>You know, I've got this cousin too
Have you met Dolores?</i>

1183
01:27:47.518 --> 01:27:49.269
Okay, I'll take it from here.
Goodbye!

1184
01:27:49.728 --> 01:27:50.938
<i>You talk so loud</i>

1185
01:27:51.104 --> 01:27:52.731
<i>You take care of your mother
And you make her proud</i>

1186
01:27:52.898 --> 01:27:54.858
<i>You write your own poetry
Every night when you go to sleep</i>

1187
01:27:55.025 --> 01:27:57.402
<i>And I'm seizing the moment
So would you wake up and notice me</i>

1188
01:27:57.569 --> 01:27:59.821
Dolores, I see you.

1189
01:27:59.988 --> 01:28:00.948
And I hear you.

1190
01:28:01.031 --> 01:28:01.865
Yes!

1191
01:28:02.032 --> 01:28:03.700
<i>All of you
All of you</i>

1192
01:28:03.867 --> 01:28:05.827
-Let's get married.
-Slow down.

1193
01:28:05.994 --> 01:28:08.247
<i>All of you
All of you</i>

1194
01:28:09.915 --> 01:28:14.002
<i>Home sweet home
I like the new foundation</i>

1195
01:28:14.169 --> 01:28:16.004
<i>It isn't perfect</i>

1196
01:28:16.171 --> 01:28:18.090
-<i>Neither are we
</i>-<i>That's true</i>

1197
01:28:18.257 --> 01:28:21.969
<i>Just one more thing before the celebration</i>

1198
01:28:22.177 --> 01:28:24.221
-<i>What?
</i>-<i>We need a doorknob</i>

1199
01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:26.014
We made this one for you.

1200
01:28:37.067 --> 01:28:40.779
<i>We see how bright you burn</i>

1201
01:28:43.782 --> 01:28:47.911
<i>We see how brave you've been</i>

1202
01:28:50.539 --> 01:28:54.126
<i>Now see yourself in turn</i>

1203
01:28:56.795 --> 01:28:59.506
<i>You're the real Gift, kid
Let us in</i>

1204
01:29:00.716 --> 01:29:03.010
<i>Open your eyes</i>

1205
01:29:08.807 --> 01:29:10.309
What do you see?

1206
01:29:12.686 --> 01:29:15.981
I see... me.

1207
01:29:18.692 --> 01:29:20.360
<i>All of me</i>

1208
01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:13.372
Come on! Get in here!

1209
01:30:29.012 --> 01:30:29.847
Yeah!

1210
01:30:43.026 --> 01:30:44.194
Yeah, <i>amor!</i>

1211
01:30:53.704 --> 01:30:55.455
