1
00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:12.781
This is a routine pursuit.

2
00:01:12.948 --> 00:01:17.202
Main Force repeats,
this is a routine pursuit. Code 44.

3
00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:19.246
Listen, you tell them we need some help.

4
00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:21.540
This should be
an open-code blitz and you know it.

5
00:01:21.707 --> 00:01:23.208
- You have your information.
- Good one.

6
00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:25.627
Come on, sweetheart,
this one's a heavyweight!

7
00:01:26.128 --> 00:01:27.671
Main Force repeats,
you have your information.

8
00:01:27.838 --> 00:01:28.755
Okay.

9
00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:32.134
This is a routine pursuit.
Please liaise with Big Bopper.

10
00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:35.721
March Hare to Big Bopper.
Assist on Code Three Red Alert.

11
00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:38.307
March Hare to Big Bopper.
March Hare to Big Bopper.

12
00:01:39.057 --> 00:01:40.892
Big Bopper. Got you, Hare.
What's going down?

13
00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:42.227
We've got a cop-killer.

14
00:01:43.312 --> 00:01:44.062
You're kidding!

15
00:01:44.563 --> 00:01:46.940
Be warned, Saree, this is non-compliance.

16
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:49.693
The Main Force will
not tolerate such action.

17
00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:55.407
This pursuit is designated
a standard Code 44.

18
00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:58.368
Please respond only to that code.

19
00:01:59.036 --> 00:02:01.830
Code 44 indicates no requirement
for a blockade.

20
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:04.499
A Pursuit Special has been stolen.

21
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.670
Hall Captain Fifi Macaffee
doesn’t like this any more than you.

22
00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:12.424
However, we must not compromise
territorial range.

23
00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:15.719
Remember that only by
following instructions

24
00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:18.930
can we hope to maintain
a successful highway program.

25
00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:22.059
Oh, Jesus, March Hare to Big Bopper.

26
00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:24.603
We're around three minutes off
the intersection. Reckon you'll make it?

27
00:02:25.187 --> 00:02:27.022
- We'll make it! Move over!
- No!

28
00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:28.398
I'm driving!

29
00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:30.984
Not this again! I've been assigned!

30
00:02:33.612 --> 00:02:37.866
Hang on. I'm supposed
to drive this crate! Darn you.

31
00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:40.202
Go on.

32
00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:43.455
Hey, Saree, what's the form on this thing?

33
00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:45.999
A twisto bikey, scoot jockey.

34
00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:48.627
A few hours ago, down in Sun City,
he goes berserk.

35
00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:50.837
Breaks custody, wastes a young premmie,

36
00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.297
and takes off in a Pursuit Special.

37
00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:54.091
We've been on him ever since.

38
00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.385
This one's right up the air, Roop.

39
00:02:56.927 --> 00:02:59.388
I've seen the style before.
Terminal psychotic.

40
00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:07.813
What's he driving?

41
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.357
That's what hurts. It's one of our V8s.

42
00:03:10.941 --> 00:03:13.151
Pursuit Special on methane. Very toey!

43
00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:24.246
Okay, we're about a half mile
off Anarchie Road.

44
00:03:24.413 --> 00:03:25.372
You'll see him any minute now.

45
00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:32.546
Rip the guts out of it.
Give it the bejesus!

46
00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:38.927
See him yet?

47
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:40.470
Got it!

48
00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:43.765
I'm gonna blow him away!

49
00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:47.394
I'm gonna ram him! I'm gonna ram him!

50
00:04:08.457 --> 00:04:09.583
Hey, fellas, you okay?

51
00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:13.712
Acknowledge, Big Bopper, acknowledge.
Are you okay?

52
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.047
Roop, Charlie.

53
00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:18.800
Do you see me, Toecutter?

54
00:04:19.301 --> 00:04:21.344
Do you see me, man?

55
00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.225
Keep going, keep going, we're okay.

56
00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:29.227
We got you, we're going.

57
00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:36.276
Born with a steering wheel in his hand

58
00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:37.944
<i>and lead in his foot.</i>

59
00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:41.239
He is the Nightrider

60
00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:45.118
cruising at the speed of fright!

61
00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:50.332
This is the Nightrider,
and we ain't never coming back!

62
00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:56.087
I'm a fuel-injected suicide machine!

63
00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.008
I am a rocker! I am a roller!

64
00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:02.385
I think we're still mobile.

65
00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:05.055
For Christ's sake, shove over!

66
00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:06.640
You're blaspheming again.

67
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.975
I don't have to work with a blasphemer.

68
00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:14.773
I am the Nightrider!

69
00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:25.784
Big Bopper to March Hare.
We're still in the game, okay?

70
00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:27.369
Understand this.

71
00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:29.830
That scag and his floozy,

72
00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:31.706
they're gonna die!

73
00:05:37.254 --> 00:05:40.215
Main Force to Gosling One.
Main Force to Gosling One.

74
00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:43.718
Code 44, standard pursuit. Please respond.

75
00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:45.387
MFP to Gosling One.

76
00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:48.098
Main Force to Gosling One.

77
00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:50.308
It was all slow motion.

78
00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:52.519
He leaves his seat and
goes through the windscreen,

79
00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:54.521
headfirst straight into the tree, right?

80
00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:56.898
And then bounces back
through the windscreen.

81
00:05:59.568 --> 00:06:02.571
And by the time we got to him,
he was just sitting there

82
00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:04.406
trying to scream with his face ripped off.

83
00:06:07.993 --> 00:06:08.577
What's the matter?

84
00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:10.328
Not hungry, am I?

85
00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:12.205
Give it here.

86
00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:14.207
I'll tell you what...

87
00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:15.083
God, look at that.

88
00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:18.503
- Christ!
- Strewth, at it again.

89
00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:20.839
Catch you later, Goose.

90
00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:50.869
Christ, they're heading for population!

91
00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:08.887
Now, what's this I hear
about you and Jonathan?

92
00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:10.680
What about Jonathan?

93
00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:12.265
You were seen out with him two nights ago.

94
00:07:12.641 --> 00:07:13.475
So what?

95
00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:19.022
It's this way.

96
00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:38.917
He's gone.

97
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.043
Bastards!

98
00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:43.254
Shit!

99
00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:45.340
We're really gonna get it this time.

100
00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:46.508
He had his indicator on.

101
00:07:47.092 --> 00:07:47.801
Shut up!

102
00:07:51.972 --> 00:07:55.308
No, no! You're not going on.
Stay off the road!

103
00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:57.227
Of course, I'm going on. Shut up!

104
00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:58.895
<i>People's lives are in peril!</i>

105
00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:02.607
Stay off the roads!

106
00:08:05.694 --> 00:08:08.279
I'm gonna have him. I'm gonna have him!

107
00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:09.030
You're in peril!

108
00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.159
Stay off the roads!

109
00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:16.329
Get off the road!

110
00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:18.248
- I've got him! Shut up! Shut up!
- Stay off the roads!

111
00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:30.343
Oh, my God.

112
00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:34.597
Watch out!

113
00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:46.693
That was a close one!

114
00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:53.908
I am ready.

115
00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:56.161
I am ready for your best.

116
00:08:58.079 --> 00:08:58.872
Oh, my God, what's happened?

117
00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:01.499
I don't know, man. I just got here meself.

118
00:09:03.168 --> 00:09:04.252
I think he broke his leg.

119
00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:06.129
I want to find out what's happening.

120
00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:08.214
Hey, Max, can you hear me?

121
00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:09.549
Main Force Patrol,

122
00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:13.511
we're out of the game,
unable to continue pursuit.

123
00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:16.056
You'd better send a meat truck.

124
00:09:16.347 --> 00:09:17.932
Charlie's copped a saucer in the throat.

125
00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:18.975
Hey, Max?

126
00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:22.353
Hey, Max?

127
00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:23.480
Go ahead.

128
00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:26.983
We are 100 percent SNAFUed.

129
00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:27.901
You okay?

130
00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:30.570
Nothing a year in the tropics
wouldn't fix.

131
00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:31.988
Much damage?

132
00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:37.035
You should see the damage, Bronze, huh?

133
00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:39.162
Metal damage,

134
00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:40.413
brain damage, huh?

135
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.748
Are you listening, Bronze?

136
00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:44.751
I am the Nightrider!

137
00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:50.465
I'm a fuel-injected suicide machine.

138
00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:53.843
I am a rocker! I am a roller!

139
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.846
I am an out-of-controller!

140
00:09:57.013 --> 00:09:57.972
Whoo!

141
00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:00.642
I am the Nightrider, baby,

142
00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:05.230
<i>and it's me and Marmaduke,
and we ain't never coming back.</i>

143
00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:25.250
The Toecutter, he knows who I am.

144
00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:28.169
I am the Nightrider!

145
00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:38.346
I am the chosen one,
the mighty hand of vengeance

146
00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:41.057
sent down to strike the unroadworthy!

147
00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:45.520
I'm hotter than a rolling dice.

148
00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:46.896
Step right up, chum,

149
00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:52.026
and watch the kid lay down a rubber road
right to freedom!

150
00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:32.233
What's wrong?

151
00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:37.197
Baby, what's wrong?

152
00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:52.086
It's going...
It's going and...

153
00:11:52.795 --> 00:11:55.173
there'll be nothing left. It's all gone.

154
00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:04.599
Stop!

155
00:13:03.866 --> 00:13:05.618
Oh. That feels good.

156
00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:09.497
After three days, that feels so good.

157
00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:14.919
I got a right hook
in the mouth this morning.

158
00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:16.087
- Sprog?
- Mm-hm.

159
00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:18.923
I told him to always lead with his left.

160
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:21.926
You know, I think we've got
a monster on our hands.

161
00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:24.512
Yeah, takes after his old man.

162
00:13:24.846 --> 00:13:25.638
What's that?

163
00:13:26.347 --> 00:13:27.223
Monster!

164
00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:31.728
Montazano, who called
himself the Nightrider,

165
00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:35.148
had broken from custody
and escaped in the police vehicle.

166
00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:36.983
- You made the news again.
- Mmm-hmm.

167
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.444
He was awaiting arraignment on charges
relating to the slaying of a Main Force...

168
00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:40.862
- Who was he?
- Don't know.

169
00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:42.822
...Patrol officer in a road blockade
accident last month.

170
00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:44.574
Just another glory rider, I guess.

171
00:13:44.907 --> 00:13:48.453
...episode in the Sun City sectors
in the past 27 days.

172
00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:11.768
Jessie, I told you.

173
00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.103
The Goose wants me there early.

174
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.396
What for, he didn't say.

175
00:14:15.688 --> 00:14:16.689
You know the Goose.

176
00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:18.983
Coffee's ready.

177
00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:45.259
I'm not grumpy.

178
00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.434
Get out of here.

179
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:57.980
Okay.

180
00:14:59.065 --> 00:14:59.816
Gotta go.

181
00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:12.120
Oi!

182
00:15:23.339 --> 00:15:24.048
What's that?

183
00:15:26.342 --> 00:15:27.343
Crazy about you.

184
00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:49.991
All supplies must be requisitioned
from the people's bond.

185
00:15:50.741 --> 00:15:53.453
Please do not exploit your privileges.

186
00:15:53.703 --> 00:15:55.413
Doing so is an offense.

187
00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:57.415
Memorandum Seven:

188
00:15:57.915 --> 00:16:00.793
The Captains of the Hall have
asked that pursuit officers

189
00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:05.298
refrain from using the slang "Bronze"”
for the Main Force Patrol.

190
00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:07.884
The word is considered disrespectful

191
00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:11.345
and citizens should be actively
discouraged from its use.

192
00:16:14.765 --> 00:16:16.142
Memorandum Eight:

193
00:16:16.767 --> 00:16:18.978
Hospital vouchers
are available again.

194
00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:23.316
MFP personnel may sign on with
the following sector captains.

195
00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:28.112
One, six-three, two-four, one-one-two,

196
00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:30.490
five-seven and two-six.

197
00:16:32.074 --> 00:16:33.326
Kick it in the guts, Barry.

198
00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:41.083
She's the last of the V8s.

199
00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:43.461
You can shut the gate on this one, Max.

200
00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:44.670
It's the duck's guts.

201
00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:46.297
Yeah, she's the last of the V8s.

202
00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:47.924
She sucks nitro.

203
00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:49.550
Phase four head.

204
00:16:49.926 --> 00:16:51.511
- Twin overhead cam.
- Tell him about the blower, yeah?

205
00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:53.471
600 horsepower through the wheel.

206
00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:54.972
The blower, the blower.

207
00:16:55.139 --> 00:16:58.684
Oh, she's meanness put to music
and the bitch is born to run.

208
00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:01.354
He's in a coma, man!

209
00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:02.438
He loves it.

210
00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:13.991
Okay.

211
00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.453
How the hell did you
get all this together?

212
00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:21.249
It just happened, Max, you know?

213
00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:24.043
Piece from here and a piece from there.

214
00:17:24.627 --> 00:17:26.170
- So easy?
- Yeah.

215
00:17:27.338 --> 00:17:29.257
Come on, Max. You--you've seen it.

216
00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:30.383
You've heard it

217
00:17:31.342 --> 00:17:32.969
and you're still asking questions.

218
00:17:37.098 --> 00:17:38.641
When do we go for a ride?

219
00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:43.271
He loves it.

220
00:17:45.064 --> 00:17:45.940
I think we've got him.

221
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:47.108
I hope so.

222
00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:48.859
Yeah, we've got him.

223
00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:51.237
Your top pursuit man
wanted to quit the road

224
00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:53.406
and we have to seduce him with candy?

225
00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:56.909
<i>People don't believe in heroes anymore.</i>

226
00:17:57.326 --> 00:18:00.246
I know, Macaffee.
You want to give them back their heroes.

227
00:18:01.497 --> 00:18:02.999
You will not try this one on me again.

228
00:18:03.332 --> 00:18:05.251
I do not enjoy wasting money.

229
00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:06.168
Goodbye

230
00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:08.421
and good luck!

231
00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:11.507
Thanks, Labatouche.

232
00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:13.843
You're a real human being.

233
00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:43.122
Get out of my way!

234
00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:44.915
The old meat grinder's
humming tonight, huh?

235
00:18:45.082 --> 00:18:47.793
Yeah, Max took out a couple of crazies
over the high side.

236
00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.340
Will you shut up!

237
00:18:54.008 --> 00:18:55.384
The hot mops and the towees.

238
00:18:58.095 --> 00:18:58.929
It's in the food.

239
00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:00.973
Hey, Max, another one for your books, eh?

240
00:19:01.682 --> 00:19:02.475
Hey, you eaten yet?

241
00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:04.560
No, not yet. I'll pick up something later.

242
00:19:04.727 --> 00:19:07.980
Hey, that Code Three you ran down
a few days ago, the, uh...

243
00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:09.315
- Nightrider?
- The Nightrider, yeah.

244
00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:10.983
- Uh, I've got a problem.
- What's that?

245
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.110
Well, his friends.
Word's out they're out to get you.

246
00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:15.196
- Scoot jockeys?
- Yeah, nomad trash.

247
00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:18.157
Mm. Well, I'll add it
to my threat collection.

248
00:19:19.241 --> 00:19:20.701
Good boy, Max. You're a good boy.

249
00:19:20.868 --> 00:19:22.036
- Hey.
- Hey!

250
00:19:22.411 --> 00:19:23.037
Come on.

251
00:21:20.863 --> 00:21:22.114
Good afternoon.

252
00:21:23.407 --> 00:21:24.283
Good afternoon.

253
00:21:25.409 --> 00:21:26.911
We're here to meet a friend.

254
00:21:27.203 --> 00:21:28.370
Come in on the train.

255
00:21:29.538 --> 00:21:31.707
Nothing come in on the train
except a couple of crates and a...

256
00:21:33.876 --> 00:21:34.460
coffin.

257
00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:37.254
Our friend.

258
00:21:38.839 --> 00:21:40.508
You'll have to see the agent
and sign the papers.

259
00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:45.095
And where do we find this agent?

260
00:21:47.765 --> 00:21:48.474
Wait.

261
00:22:04.782 --> 00:22:06.158
That must be your friend over there.

262
00:22:06.575 --> 00:22:07.743
They didn't leave much of him.

263
00:22:09.078 --> 00:22:11.705
Must have cut his heart out, eh?

264
00:22:15.167 --> 00:22:17.253
Yes, that's what I meant.

265
00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:20.172
Poor bastard.

266
00:22:22.174 --> 00:22:24.677
The Nightrider.

267
00:22:26.387 --> 00:22:27.763
That is his name.

268
00:22:28.973 --> 00:22:31.267
The Nightrider.

269
00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.228
The Nightrider.

270
00:22:35.437 --> 00:22:36.438
Remember him

271
00:22:37.231 --> 00:22:38.983
when you look at the night sky.

272
00:22:40.985 --> 00:22:41.694
I will.

273
00:22:43.821 --> 00:22:44.780
Take your hat off.

274
00:23:01.505 --> 00:23:02.381
Anything you say.

275
00:23:03.132 --> 00:23:05.050
Anything I say.

276
00:23:06.719 --> 00:23:08.929
What a wonderful philosophy you have.

277
00:23:09.555 --> 00:23:10.389
Take him away.

278
00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:22.067
Bubba. Johnny.

279
00:24:04.026 --> 00:24:04.985
- Whoo!
- Oh?

280
00:24:05.569 --> 00:24:06.779
Oh.

281
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:08.447
Push me, shove you!

282
00:24:08.614 --> 00:24:09.782
Oh, yeah? Says who?

283
00:24:09.949 --> 00:24:12.868
- Push me, shove you!
- Oh, yeah? Says who?

284
00:24:13.035 --> 00:24:15.621
Push me, shove you!
Oh, yeah? Says who?

285
00:24:15.788 --> 00:24:17.623
Push me, shove you!
Oh, yeah? Says who?

286
00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:19.750
Push me, shove you!
Oh, yeah? Says who?

287
00:24:19.917 --> 00:24:21.585
Push me, shove you!
Oh, yeah? Says who?

288
00:24:31.095 --> 00:24:32.388
Come on!

289
00:24:32.763 --> 00:24:35.099
Nightrider!

290
00:24:36.141 --> 00:24:38.102
Nightrider!

291
00:24:40.896 --> 00:24:41.897
Nightrider!

292
00:25:07.798 --> 00:25:09.883
Whoo! Whoo!

293
00:25:10.342 --> 00:25:11.552
Whoo-hoo!

294
00:25:25.315 --> 00:25:26.150
No worries.

295
00:27:18.929 --> 00:27:20.180
Anyway, my name is Jim Goose.

296
00:27:22.891 --> 00:27:23.725
Rockatansky.

297
00:27:24.059 --> 00:27:25.561
We have incident at Wee Jerusalem.

298
00:27:26.061 --> 00:27:27.437
Nomad bikers, bulk trouble.

299
00:27:28.438 --> 00:27:30.357
Okay, we're on it. We gone.

300
00:27:31.441 --> 00:27:32.943
Goose, come on.

301
00:27:39.741 --> 00:27:40.409
What's this?

302
00:27:40.784 --> 00:27:42.494
It's a "Get Out Of Jail Free" card.

303
00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:00.637
Any more details?

304
00:28:00.971 --> 00:28:01.597
Nope.

305
00:28:03.348 --> 00:28:04.683
Okay, we're gone.

306
00:28:07.144 --> 00:28:08.228
Hey, Max, he looks...

307
00:28:08.812 --> 00:28:09.479
Yeah.

308
00:28:13.233 --> 00:28:14.735
Hey, fella, hey, stop!

309
00:28:16.361 --> 00:28:17.279
Hey, fella!

310
00:28:20.407 --> 00:28:21.575
Hey, fella, stop!

311
00:28:24.161 --> 00:28:25.037
What a turkey!

312
00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:28.707
Hey, fella, you're a turkey,
you know that?

313
00:28:29.833 --> 00:28:31.919
We'll come back for him later.
There's more up ahead.

314
00:28:36.048 --> 00:28:37.132
Nightrider.

315
00:28:46.391 --> 00:28:49.561
Pursuit units in sectors
eight, nine, and ten.

316
00:28:53.482 --> 00:28:55.234
A cyclecade of nomad bikers.

317
00:28:55.484 --> 00:28:57.527
A fast run out of Wee Jerusalem.

318
00:28:57.945 --> 00:28:59.655
Your instructions are to locate

319
00:29:00.072 --> 00:29:01.823
but do not engage.

320
00:29:06.161 --> 00:29:08.413
Sector Eight. Nomad bikers.

321
00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:14.127
Bronze!

322
00:29:14.503 --> 00:29:15.087
Hey!

323
00:29:15.879 --> 00:29:16.672
Gonna get you!

324
00:29:17.881 --> 00:29:20.175
Okay, okay. It's okay.

325
00:29:21.385 --> 00:29:23.887
It's all right, it's all right.
No one's gonna hurt you.

326
00:29:24.054 --> 00:29:25.472
Hey. It's all right.

327
00:29:25.931 --> 00:29:27.557
This one's whacked right out of his skull.

328
00:29:27.724 --> 00:29:30.102
Whacked right out of his skull, man!

329
00:29:30.269 --> 00:29:32.354
He ain't never coming back. Whoo!

330
00:29:43.782 --> 00:29:46.243
It's all right.
It's all right.

331
00:29:48.245 --> 00:29:49.538
I'm gonna let this go now.

332
00:29:54.126 --> 00:29:55.419
I know you're frightened, girl,

333
00:29:56.753 --> 00:29:58.505
but no one's gonna hurt you anymore.

334
00:30:00.465 --> 00:30:03.593
My name's Jim Goose,
and everything's gonna be all right.

335
00:30:18.442 --> 00:30:19.818
The Nightrider!

336
00:30:20.402 --> 00:30:21.695
- Hey, Jimbo.
- Yep.

337
00:30:22.946 --> 00:30:24.156
Remember that Code Three?

338
00:30:24.323 --> 00:30:24.906
Yeah.

339
00:30:26.241 --> 00:30:28.285
Remember him when you look up at...

340
00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:30.203
When you look...

341
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:32.998
Nightrider!

342
00:30:35.292 --> 00:30:37.586
Well, well, well.

343
00:31:01.693 --> 00:31:03.820
Johnny the Boy has done it again.

344
00:31:05.113 --> 00:31:06.406
This time it's a scrubber.

345
00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:08.867
He's never gonna learn.

346
00:31:10.994 --> 00:31:12.996
But we are going to teach him, Bubba.

347
00:31:13.955 --> 00:31:15.916
You are going back for him.

348
00:31:16.708 --> 00:31:19.419
No way. Not me, not for him!

349
00:31:20.504 --> 00:31:21.671
But it's not for him.

350
00:31:22.547 --> 00:31:24.174
It's for me, Bubba.

351
00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.600
You're wasting your time!
The scag don't rate!

352
00:31:34.184 --> 00:31:35.727
He's nothing like the Nightrider!

353
00:31:58.417 --> 00:32:00.210
Code Seven progress, eight-one.

354
00:32:00.544 --> 00:32:02.295
Code Seven progress, eight-three.

355
00:32:02.462 --> 00:32:05.424

356
00:32:06.508 --> 00:32:07.717

357
00:32:08.552 --> 00:32:10.303
Captain Macaffee in convoy from

358
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.222
the courthouse to
the Halls of Justice.

359
00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:13.515
Code One progress.

360
00:32:31.283 --> 00:32:31.992
Hey, mister.

361
00:32:32.826 --> 00:32:33.869
What happened to the car?

362
00:32:35.245 --> 00:32:36.455
What do you think happened?

363
00:32:37.873 --> 00:32:39.499
Looks like it was chewed up and spat out.

364
00:32:41.668 --> 00:32:43.837
Perhaps it's the result of an anxiety.

365
00:32:45.005 --> 00:32:45.964
Hey, Roop.

366
00:32:47.299 --> 00:32:48.175
Stay here, mate.

367
00:32:57.309 --> 00:32:59.394
I think they're out there.

368
00:33:00.395 --> 00:33:01.480
Take your time, Charlie.

369
00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:02.814
We got plenty of it.

370
00:33:03.231 --> 00:33:04.441
A good day and good luck.

371
00:33:07.277 --> 00:33:10.405
I can see the Interceptor.

372
00:33:17.412 --> 00:33:18.497
What do you say, scag?

373
00:33:19.122 --> 00:33:20.499
Got no place special to go, eh?

374
00:33:21.917 --> 00:33:23.585
- We'd better prep him.
- No place special to go.

375
00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:26.129
Scag, did you bring your toothbrush?

376
00:33:30.175 --> 00:33:31.801
- You'll have to sit on the Goose.
- Why?

377
00:33:31.968 --> 00:33:33.220
- No contest.
- Whoa.

378
00:33:52.531 --> 00:33:53.573
Hey, Fif! What's going on?

379
00:33:53.823 --> 00:33:55.408
- What happened?
- Let him go, Charlie.

380
00:33:55.659 --> 00:33:57.410
What's he mean, "Let him go"?
Hey, who's this?

381
00:33:57.661 --> 00:33:58.954
- Keep out of this.
- Listen, what's going on?

382
00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.121
No one showed, okay?

383
00:34:00.539 --> 00:34:02.207
Forget it, Charlie. Just let him go.

384
00:34:02.374 --> 00:34:03.833
Forget it, Charlie. Just let him go.

385
00:34:04.084 --> 00:34:05.377
No one showed. No one.

386
00:34:05.794 --> 00:34:07.712
What's he mean, "No one showed"?

387
00:34:07.879 --> 00:34:08.964
They didn't show.

388
00:34:09.506 --> 00:34:11.633
Nobody! The punks didn't show.

389
00:34:11.883 --> 00:34:14.844
The girl didn't show,
the townspeople didn't show.

390
00:34:15.095 --> 00:34:16.555
Nobody showed!

391
00:34:17.055 --> 00:34:18.348
We're screwed! It's the law.

392
00:34:18.515 --> 00:34:19.599
What do you--what do you mean,
"No one showed"?

393
00:34:19.766 --> 00:34:20.809
- No one--
- Where were you, man?

394
00:34:20.976 --> 00:34:22.936
It means, old man, you haven't got a case.

395
00:34:23.103 --> 00:34:24.062
No contest.

396
00:34:24.563 --> 00:34:27.691
Jesus Christ! You're not gonna
let him walk out the door, Fifi?

397
00:34:27.857 --> 00:34:29.025
That's exactly what you're going to do!

398
00:34:29.317 --> 00:34:31.987
- Shut up!
- Keep going, Charlie! Keep going!

399
00:34:32.946 --> 00:34:34.364
Come on. It's all right. Come on.

400
00:34:34.531 --> 00:34:38.535
Hey, Bronze! Hey, look at you,
a cripple and a mute!

401
00:34:38.702 --> 00:34:41.705
You scag, he sings and I tap dance!

402
00:34:42.205 --> 00:34:44.332
Hey! Hey, you know that you're wrong!

403
00:34:45.834 --> 00:34:46.710
The courts will hear about this.

404
00:34:46.876 --> 00:34:48.962
I promise you.
The courts will hear about this disgrace.

405
00:34:49.129 --> 00:34:50.755
- Get out of here!
- He wearing that face for a bet

406
00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:52.591
or does he really look that stupid?

407
00:34:52.757 --> 00:34:54.551
- This man is grossly offensive!
- Out of my way.

408
00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:56.219
Get him out of here, Max!

409
00:34:56.386 --> 00:34:57.637
I can make a case of it!

410
00:34:57.804 --> 00:34:59.014
What case, you fool?

411
00:34:59.556 --> 00:35:01.099
You saw what they did to that girl!

412
00:35:01.266 --> 00:35:03.476
For God's sake, she was the town bike!

413
00:35:06.646 --> 00:35:09.566
He's my prisoner,
and he's not walking out that door!

414
00:35:09.858 --> 00:35:10.483
Get him out of here!

415
00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:11.776
Who is this guy?

416
00:35:11.943 --> 00:35:14.279
Goose, settle down, boy.

417
00:35:16.364 --> 00:35:17.866
Right, go, go, come on!

418
00:35:18.992 --> 00:35:20.493
Jesus, Fifi. Jesus.

419
00:35:21.077 --> 00:35:22.329
Look, they're laughing at us!

420
00:35:22.495 --> 00:35:24.205
Can't you see they're laughing at us?

421
00:35:24.372 --> 00:35:25.457
They don't believe us!

422
00:35:29.002 --> 00:35:30.211
See you later, Goose.

423
00:35:31.379 --> 00:35:32.088
It's been a pleasure.

424
00:36:00.367 --> 00:36:03.870
Skiffington, go home. Go.

425
00:36:04.621 --> 00:36:05.413
Hey, Goose!

426
00:36:06.122 --> 00:36:07.707
You can't do anything about it!

427
00:36:08.291 --> 00:36:10.251
We know who you are, Bronze!

428
00:36:10.669 --> 00:36:12.295
We'll see you on the road, scag!

429
00:36:12.879 --> 00:36:15.131
See you on the road
like we saw the Nightrider!

430
00:36:15.882 --> 00:36:20.011
We remember the Nightrider,
and we know who you are!

431
00:36:26.935 --> 00:36:27.852
Okay.

432
00:36:28.728 --> 00:36:29.729
So long as the paperwork's clean,

433
00:36:29.896 --> 00:36:31.439
you boys can do what you like out there.

434
00:36:35.527 --> 00:36:40.073
Hey, [indistinct] there he is,
the walking armpit!

435
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:53.211
There's a fire in my belly,
and she's the woman to put it out.

436
00:36:53.378 --> 00:36:55.922
Off, brute! This angel is hot
in the tubes for me!

437
00:37:02.303 --> 00:37:04.180
I'm on fire, I'm on fire!

438
00:37:04.347 --> 00:37:06.349
Joviality is a game of children.

439
00:37:06.516 --> 00:37:07.434
She's mine.

440
00:37:07.934 --> 00:37:10.770
I should have been
a surgeon with these hands.

441
00:37:14.899 --> 00:37:17.360
Mudguts, get out of there.

442
00:37:20.113 --> 00:37:22.782
Cundalini, put her against the post.

443
00:37:29.247 --> 00:37:30.498
We have a problem here.

444
00:37:31.624 --> 00:37:34.544
She is not what she seems.

445
00:37:35.336 --> 00:37:38.131
Bubba Zanetti has it on good authority

446
00:37:39.048 --> 00:37:42.302
she's sent by the Bronze,
full of treachery.

447
00:37:47.515 --> 00:37:50.268
The Bronze take our pride.

448
00:38:01.905 --> 00:38:05.158
If you're going to waste the Bronze,
you gotta do it big!

449
00:38:05.492 --> 00:38:09.704
You just don't have the style,
do you, chicken shit?

450
00:38:11.873 --> 00:38:14.250
Goes to water on a dummy.

451
00:38:28.389 --> 00:38:30.642
It's all right. Hm? It's okay.

452
00:38:31.976 --> 00:38:32.852
It's okay.

453
00:38:33.978 --> 00:38:35.605
Just remember

454
00:38:36.815 --> 00:38:42.862
to keep your sweet, sweet mouth shut!

455
00:39:06.636 --> 00:39:07.262
Whoo!

456
00:39:20.149 --> 00:39:21.693
MFP, Gosling One.

457
00:39:23.361 --> 00:39:25.572
Main Force Patrol to Gosling One.

458
00:39:27.323 --> 00:39:28.992
We have a curfew violation.

459
00:39:29.492 --> 00:39:30.910
MFP, Gosling One.

460
00:39:31.244 --> 00:39:32.328
Gosling One.

461
00:39:32.787 --> 00:39:34.622
Code Triple-Three in progress.

462
00:39:34.873 --> 00:39:35.832
Main Force.

463
00:39:36.916 --> 00:39:38.585
Would someone inform the Goose...

All units again progress.

478
00:40:19.667 --> 00:40:21.294
All units again progress.

479
00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:48.655
...units to Three Day Angel Patrol.

480
00:40:49.656 --> 00:40:51.532
Nice to have you back, Big Bopper Two.

481
00:40:51.866 --> 00:40:55.078
Sun City Sector Three,
Code Four Trauma in progress.

482
00:40:55.495 --> 00:40:58.539
Sun City Sector Nine,
Code Four in progress.

483
00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:31.567
MFP eight-one.

484
00:43:32.568 --> 00:43:33.486
A memorandum:

485
00:43:34.153 --> 00:43:35.279
For the cannibalization...

486
00:43:35.446 --> 00:43:36.823
MFP, copy.

487
00:43:38.074 --> 00:43:38.991
MFP, copy.

488
00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:41.327
Hey, hey, hey, hey, it's the Goose.

489
00:43:48.251 --> 00:43:51.796
You're a lucky boy. Not even a road rash.

490
00:43:52.797 --> 00:43:53.548
Hey, Midge,

491
00:43:54.966 --> 00:43:55.925
don't write off the Goose

492
00:43:56.092 --> 00:43:58.302
until you see the box going into the hole.

493
00:43:59.804 --> 00:44:02.140
Yeah, well, don't wreck me truck now.

494
00:44:02.306 --> 00:44:03.349
I'll bring it back tomorrow.

495
00:44:03.683 --> 00:44:04.433
Yeah, no hurry.

496
00:44:05.935 --> 00:44:07.812
Hey, you sure you're all right?

497
00:44:08.479 --> 00:44:10.148
Couldn't be righter.

498
00:44:11.774 --> 00:44:15.903
Jimmy the Goose,
larger than life and twice as ugly!

499
00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:39.195
Light me, Johnny.

500
00:46:01.342 --> 00:46:02.218
Light another.

501
00:46:04.845 --> 00:46:05.596
Hey...

502
00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:11.560
This is a threshold moment, Johnny.
Step through.

503
00:46:11.727 --> 00:46:13.396
Toecutter, this isn't what I want.

504
00:46:15.022 --> 00:46:15.648
Light it!

505
00:46:21.237 --> 00:46:24.740
The Bronze, they keep you
from being proud.

506
00:46:25.992 --> 00:46:28.995
Look at him. He looks silly,
doesn't he, upside down?

507
00:46:31.455 --> 00:46:34.542
- Do it for freedom and the Nightrider!
-I can't.

508
00:46:34.709 --> 00:46:35.626
- Throw it.
- No!

509
00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:39.171
You scum-sucking trash!

510
00:46:39.338 --> 00:46:40.339
Throw it!

511
00:46:40.923 --> 00:46:43.592
- Throw it!
- I can't stand the pain!

512
00:47:16.751 --> 00:47:18.252
Max. Max.

513
00:47:18.711 --> 00:47:19.420
Max!

514
00:48:15.434 --> 00:48:17.436
Max! Hey, Max!

515
00:48:19.021 --> 00:48:22.983
That thing in there,
that's not the Goose. No way.

516
00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:30.468
I was hungry.

517
00:49:33.262 --> 00:49:34.430
Peanut butter and honey.

518
00:49:50.905 --> 00:49:52.740
I just can't get it
clear in my head, Jess.

519
00:49:55.701 --> 00:49:56.952
He was so full of living, you know.

520
00:49:57.828 --> 00:49:59.121
He ran the franchise on it.

521
00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.124
Now there's nothing.

522
00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:08.172
Here I am, trying to put sense to it

523
00:50:09.048 --> 00:50:10.216
when I know there isn't any.

524
00:50:15.471 --> 00:50:17.431
I'll be all right,
once I get it clear in my head.

525
00:50:41.497 --> 00:50:42.164
Fif.

526
00:50:43.999 --> 00:50:44.583
Fif.

527
00:50:48.379 --> 00:50:49.004
What's this?

528
00:50:49.505 --> 00:50:50.089
I'm through.

529
00:50:50.839 --> 00:50:52.216
- Again?
- No, not again.

530
00:50:52.383 --> 00:50:53.717
I'm through. I'm quitting.

531
00:50:53.968 --> 00:50:54.635
Sit down.

532
00:50:54.969 --> 00:50:56.387
No, I didn't come here to discuss it,

533
00:50:56.554 --> 00:50:58.514
I came to say it. I'm through.

534
00:50:59.265 --> 00:51:00.349
Now, just a minute!

535
00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:04.270
All right, so the Goose bought it.

536
00:51:04.687 --> 00:51:06.105
But that's the way
he always came at the world.

537
00:51:06.272 --> 00:51:06.855
Off beat.

538
00:51:07.606 --> 00:51:10.359
Max, you'd be the first
to admit it was long overdue.

539
00:51:12.027 --> 00:51:13.737
All right, I'll tell you how it is.

540
00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:15.489
You're a winner, Max.

541
00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:17.533
You're on the top shelf

542
00:51:18.075 --> 00:51:18.909
and I'm not gonna lose you

543
00:51:19.076 --> 00:51:21.120
because of some crazy notion
about quitting!

544
00:51:24.164 --> 00:51:27.418
They say people don't believe
in heroes anymore.

545
00:51:28.586 --> 00:51:29.545
Well, damn them!

546
00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:31.505
You and me, Max,

547
00:51:32.881 --> 00:51:35.342
we're gonna give them back their heroes.

548
00:51:35.634 --> 00:51:39.263
Fif...do you really expect me
to go for that crap?

549
00:51:40.139 --> 00:51:42.016
You gotta admit,
I sounded good there for a minute, huh?

550
00:51:42.182 --> 00:51:43.100
Yeah.

551
00:51:43.684 --> 00:51:44.351
Bye, Fifi.

552
00:51:45.144 --> 00:51:47.646
Hey! Hey, come on, do you want me to beg?

553
00:51:48.856 --> 00:51:50.482
Do you want me on my knees, crying?

554
00:51:52.026 --> 00:51:53.235
Now just a minute.

555
00:51:54.153 --> 00:51:55.404
Give me a reason.

556
00:51:59.658 --> 00:52:00.701
I'm scared, Fif.

557
00:52:02.244 --> 00:52:03.037
Do you know why?

558
00:52:03.454 --> 00:52:04.997
It's that rat circus out there.

559
00:52:05.831 --> 00:52:06.832
I'm beginning to enjoy it.

560
00:52:06.999 --> 00:52:08.542
What is this, funny week?

561
00:52:08.709 --> 00:52:11.378
Look, any longer out on that road,
and I'm one of them, you know?

562
00:52:11.795 --> 00:52:13.172
A terminal crazy.

563
00:52:13.922 --> 00:52:16.800
Only I've got a bronze badge
to say I'm one of the good guys.

564
00:52:17.217 --> 00:52:18.552
You know what I'm trying to say?

565
00:52:20.512 --> 00:52:21.639
I'll tell you what I'll do.

566
00:52:27.227 --> 00:52:28.646
Take off a few weeks, huh?

567
00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:31.482
Grow yourself a beard.

568
00:52:32.483 --> 00:52:34.735
Draw flies.
Just think about it for a while.

569
00:52:35.694 --> 00:52:38.113
If you still feel the same way
when you come back, it's okay by me.

570
00:52:39.114 --> 00:52:39.782
Go on.

571
00:52:45.913 --> 00:52:46.955
I'm not gonna change my mind.

572
00:52:47.748 --> 00:52:49.792
Get out of here
before I decide to come with you, huh?

573
00:52:51.877 --> 00:52:54.171
Bye, Fif. Thank you.

574
00:52:58.217 --> 00:52:59.968
You'll be back, Rockatansky!

575
00:53:01.303 --> 00:53:02.680
You're hooked, Max.

576
00:53:03.722 --> 00:53:04.723
And you know it!

577
00:54:10.706 --> 00:54:15.169
I've never been able to say things to you,
Jess, about how I feel.

578
00:54:17.629 --> 00:54:19.715
Guess I always counted on
you understanding.

579
00:54:28.056 --> 00:54:28.974
When I was a kid,

580
00:54:30.476 --> 00:54:34.521
me and my father
used to go for long walks.

581
00:54:36.982 --> 00:54:39.067
I remember staring down at his shoes.

582
00:54:41.028 --> 00:54:43.906
They were special shoes, brown.

583
00:54:45.115 --> 00:54:47.284
And he always kept them really shiny.

584
00:54:50.204 --> 00:54:54.333
He was tall,
and he used to take long strides.

585
00:54:55.834 --> 00:54:57.628
And there I'd be right alongside him

586
00:54:58.796 --> 00:55:00.214
just trying to keep up with him.

587
00:55:04.802 --> 00:55:09.139
I don't think he ever knew
how proud I felt of him.

588
00:55:11.475 --> 00:55:13.977
Or how good it felt
just to be there alongside him.

589
00:55:17.523 --> 00:55:19.817
Even now, when I think back on it,
I still feel...

590
00:55:24.947 --> 00:55:26.114
The thing is, Jess,

591
00:55:28.575 --> 00:55:30.077
I couldn't tell him about it then,

592
00:55:30.786 --> 00:55:32.454
but I can tell you about it now.

593
00:55:36.375 --> 00:55:37.668
I don't wanna wait 10 years

594
00:55:37.835 --> 00:55:39.211
to tell you how I'm feeling
about you right now.

595
00:55:39.378 --> 00:55:39.962
Do you know...

596
00:56:06.989 --> 00:56:07.573
Hello.

597
00:56:08.156 --> 00:56:08.991
Get a load of that!

598
00:56:09.157 --> 00:56:10.701
Yeah, we had a blowout a while back.

599
00:56:10.868 --> 00:56:12.202
Raunchy, very raunchy.

600
00:56:13.412 --> 00:56:14.204
What's the donk like?

601
00:56:14.371 --> 00:56:16.331
Yeah, the donk's fine.
Look, about this tire...

602
00:56:17.332 --> 00:56:18.667
Don't do much work on these meself,

603
00:56:18.834 --> 00:56:20.377
except to scrape them off the road.

604
00:56:21.086 --> 00:56:23.213
Yeah. Hey, how about this tire, huh?

605
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:24.590
Have it fixed in no time.

606
00:56:24.756 --> 00:56:26.675
I can sell you a set of "lops
for next to nothing.

607
00:56:26.925 --> 00:56:27.634
No, thanks.

608
00:56:27.801 --> 00:56:29.261
I can't remember where I got 'em,

609
00:56:29.595 --> 00:56:30.971
but I got 'em, know what I mean?

610
00:56:31.138 --> 00:56:34.224
No, we'll be all right
just as soon as we get this fixed.

611
00:56:34.850 --> 00:56:35.893
- Max?
- Yeah?

612
00:56:37.769 --> 00:56:38.353
Listen,

613
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:42.733
Sproggo's talked me into
buying him an ice cream, so, uh,

614
00:56:43.317 --> 00:56:44.401
I think I'll see you later.

615
00:56:45.277 --> 00:56:47.821
Sure, there's a shop just down the beach.

616
00:56:48.405 --> 00:56:49.865
They'll appreciate the business.

617
00:56:50.324 --> 00:56:51.575
Sure, thanks.

618
00:56:52.659 --> 00:56:53.285
Toodlepip.

619
00:57:08.175 --> 00:57:09.593
- You just trucking around?
- Yeah.

620
00:57:09.843 --> 00:57:11.345
- Good time for just trucking.
- Mm.

621
00:57:11.595 --> 00:57:12.930
Wish I could do a bit meself.

622
00:57:13.347 --> 00:57:14.681
Which way you heading? North?

623
00:57:14.848 --> 00:57:15.599
Uh, maybe.

624
00:57:46.171 --> 00:57:48.340
Look what's turned up for Sunday dinner.

625
00:57:49.633 --> 00:57:52.302
Main course and dessert.

626
00:57:53.136 --> 00:57:54.638
My favorite kind.

627
00:57:55.722 --> 00:57:56.640
Female.

628
00:58:11.863 --> 00:58:13.657
Puss, puss, puss, puss, puss.

629
00:58:22.290 --> 00:58:22.958
Hey, you.

630
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:29.214
Hey, whoa.

631
00:58:36.847 --> 00:58:38.056
Watch the tongue, lovable.

632
00:58:38.223 --> 00:58:40.392
I've seen him lick his own eyebrow clean.

633
00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:15.135
That's not cheaply done.
You must've spent some coin.

634
00:59:15.469 --> 00:59:18.472
Like the sign says,
speed's just a question of money.

635
00:59:18.972 --> 00:59:20.390
How fast do you wanna go?

636
00:59:21.308 --> 00:59:22.768
- Max, quick, get in.
- What's wrong?

637
00:59:23.018 --> 00:59:24.644
Look, just take my word for it, get in!

638
00:59:24.811 --> 00:59:25.729
What about the tire?

639
00:59:25.896 --> 00:59:27.064
Please, Max!

640
00:59:29.816 --> 00:59:31.109
Hey, your tire, man.

641
00:59:32.527 --> 00:59:34.988
Hey, fella, what about your tire?

642
00:59:38.784 --> 00:59:39.868
Crazy people, man.

643
00:59:41.828 --> 00:59:43.163
The world's full of crazy people.

644
01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:02.015
- That wagon.
- Yeah?

645
01:00:02.182 --> 01:00:02.766
Was it here?

646
01:00:02.933 --> 01:00:05.685
Sure, sure, a couple with a kid.
I was just fixing their tire.

647
01:00:06.144 --> 01:00:07.938
They left their goddamn spare.
Not a bad one either.

648
01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:11.525
Who are they?

649
01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:14.277
A couple, passing through.

650
01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:16.530
Said they were heading north. Maybe.

651
01:00:29.501 --> 01:00:31.128
You want to drive the car? Yeah?

652
01:00:31.711 --> 01:00:33.088
Well, you can't anymore.

653
01:00:33.421 --> 01:00:34.256
Into the back.

654
01:00:34.506 --> 01:00:35.340
Here you go.

655
01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:39.594
I can still see his face now.

656
01:00:40.095 --> 01:00:41.721
Looked as if he'd just swallowed a brick.

657
01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:44.307
What a mean old lady you are. Huh, boss?

658
01:00:45.183 --> 01:00:47.018
That's enough from you, mate! Enough.

659
01:00:52.899 --> 01:00:54.025
What's the matter with you?

660
01:00:58.530 --> 01:00:59.781
What you got there, mate?

661
01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:05.078
Max!

662
01:01:10.167 --> 01:01:13.295
Yup. Yeah, that's the way I see it, too.

663
01:01:14.713 --> 01:01:15.839
Eh. Yeah.

664
01:01:16.631 --> 01:01:19.217
Yep, sure.
Sure, it's been nice talking to you. Bye.

665
01:01:21.303 --> 01:01:22.387
Take it you agreed with him.

666
01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:24.222
They aren't worried, I'm not worried.

667
01:01:24.389 --> 01:01:25.265
And what about that?

668
01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:28.977
I figure it's lost property.

669
01:01:29.561 --> 01:01:32.522
If no one makes a claim to it,
I say we can forget it.

670
01:01:34.816 --> 01:01:35.984
Sounds okay to me, Jess.

671
01:01:36.651 --> 01:01:37.402
Don't know.

672
01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.989
If Ziggy says so, believe me, it's okay.

673
01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:43.617
May's expecting you
up at the farm sometime.

674
01:01:44.784 --> 01:01:45.785
You'll have no trouble up there.

675
01:01:46.286 --> 01:01:47.412
Just green grass.

676
01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:22.572
How are you doing?

677
01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:24.991
Mm. I'm getting there.

678
01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:36.503
I reckon you ought to connect
the doohickey to the gizmo.

679
01:02:39.464 --> 01:02:40.131
Come here, you.

680
01:02:40.548 --> 01:02:44.261
Oh, you touch me with those hands
and I'll rip you apart. No!

681
01:02:44.511 --> 01:02:46.554
No, look at them! No!

682
01:02:46.888 --> 01:02:48.431
No! No!

683
01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:49.766
No!

684
01:03:05.699 --> 01:03:07.993
May told me about the little beach
down by the trees.

685
01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:09.869
- Hm?
- Do you want to come?

686
01:03:10.537 --> 01:03:11.246
Love to.

687
01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.540
Except that I've gotta fix the fan belt,

688
01:03:13.707 --> 01:03:15.041
or we're never gonna get out of here.

689
01:03:16.334 --> 01:03:19.004
Okay, Tarzan,
I'll bring you back some bananas.

690
01:03:19.504 --> 01:03:20.171
Do that.

691
01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:33.643
Oi!

692
01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:54.706
Jessie.

693
01:03:56.374 --> 01:03:58.960
If you meet Benno down there,
don't let him trouble you.

694
01:03:59.294 --> 01:04:00.295
He's only a baby.

695
01:04:02.255 --> 01:04:03.048
Sure, May.

696
01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:51.067
The men.

697
01:07:52.193 --> 01:07:53.152
What men?
Come on.

698
01:07:53.695 --> 01:07:55.321
Now you calm down
and you tell me what's the matter.

699
01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:57.490
Very, very naughty.

700
01:07:58.074 --> 01:07:59.033
Now, you tell May--

701
01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.368
- May.
- ...what you...

702
01:08:00.952 --> 01:08:03.830
May, you call The Dark One.

703
01:08:04.289 --> 01:08:07.041
And you tell him to get here
as fast as he can.

704
01:08:07.375 --> 01:08:08.418
Why? What's going on?

705
01:08:08.585 --> 01:08:09.669
I think we've got some hoon trouble.

706
01:08:09.836 --> 01:08:11.546
- Oh.
- It's gonna be all right.

707
01:08:12.672 --> 01:08:14.674
Come on, darling. Come on, Jessie.

708
01:08:14.841 --> 01:08:17.051
Well, let's go into the house, huh?

709
01:08:17.677 --> 01:08:18.636
Come on.

710
01:08:30.273 --> 01:08:33.526
You've had an awful time, darling.

711
01:08:34.527 --> 01:08:36.404
But it's all over now.

712
01:08:37.572 --> 01:08:40.116
Everything's gonna be all right.

713
01:08:45.538 --> 01:08:47.582
I've just got to go and make a phone call

714
01:08:48.333 --> 01:08:50.835
and then we'll have
a nice hot cup of tea, eh?

715
01:09:09.646 --> 01:09:12.940
The Dark One, and hurry it up, will you?

716
01:09:13.524 --> 01:09:14.901
It's May Swaisey.

717
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:25.536
Sprog? Oh, no!

718
01:09:35.338 --> 01:09:36.381
Sprog?

719
01:09:40.259 --> 01:09:41.302
Sprog!

720
01:09:46.057 --> 01:09:47.058
Sprog!

721
01:09:55.566 --> 01:09:56.567
Sprog!

722
01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:06.285
Sprog!

723
01:10:08.788 --> 01:10:12.208
Well, well, well.

724
01:10:13.626 --> 01:10:15.002
It's our little mother.

725
01:10:19.382 --> 01:10:21.884
That there is Cundalini

726
01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:25.221
and Cundalini wants his hand back.

727
01:10:27.849 --> 01:10:28.641
I want my baby.

728
01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:29.851
Tell you what,

729
01:10:32.437 --> 01:10:33.146
I'll swap you.

730
01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:36.774
Please, give me my baby.

731
01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:37.942
Jessie.

732
01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.279
Jessie, Jessie.

733
01:10:42.113 --> 01:10:44.449
You've not got a sense of humor.

734
01:10:45.867 --> 01:10:47.160
You've got a pretty face, though.

735
01:10:48.286 --> 01:10:49.537
Awful pretty.

736
01:10:50.621 --> 01:10:51.873
Awful pretty.

737
01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:56.294
I suppose you don't need
a sense of humor with a pretty face.

738
01:10:57.837 --> 01:10:59.213
The only trouble is though, missy,

739
01:11:00.381 --> 01:11:01.132
if you should...

740
01:11:03.509 --> 01:11:04.927
lose the face...

741
01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:06.679
Please, don't hurt my baby.

742
01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:08.181
You've got nothing!

743
01:11:08.473 --> 01:11:09.891
What do you want from me?

744
01:11:11.058 --> 01:11:14.103
- Don't change the subject.
- Hold it!

745
01:11:15.354 --> 01:11:16.564
- Right there!
- Ahh!

746
01:11:17.648 --> 01:11:19.233
Ah! I hate guns.

747
01:11:19.567 --> 01:11:20.359
Old lady.

748
01:11:20.902 --> 01:11:21.736
Stand back!

749
01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:23.196
Stay back!

750
01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:24.655
Woman!

751
01:11:24.822 --> 01:11:25.656
Stay back!

752
01:11:33.915 --> 01:11:38.085
Anyone so much as breathes,
I'll cheese him!

753
01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:39.879
Open that door.

754
01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:42.089
Every one of you, in there.

755
01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:46.552
Put the babe on the ground.

756
01:11:50.264 --> 01:11:52.099
Jessie, get the van.

757
01:12:31.806 --> 01:12:34.475
Don't stop. Just go right through it.

758
01:12:58.374 --> 01:12:59.458
Oh, now what?

759
01:13:07.508 --> 01:13:09.510
- The motor!
- What are you trying to say?

760
01:13:09.677 --> 01:13:11.095
I don't know, it just died on me!

761
01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:15.016
Get out. Run!

762
01:13:38.873 --> 01:13:39.540
Oh!

763
01:14:01.646 --> 01:14:02.355
Jessie!

764
01:14:03.689 --> 01:14:04.899
- Where? Where?
- Jess.

765
01:14:06.484 --> 01:14:08.027
Lord, have mercy!

766
01:14:09.654 --> 01:14:10.321
Lord!

767
01:14:54.782 --> 01:14:55.366
What do you reckon?

768
01:14:56.075 --> 01:14:58.035
Jesus, I'm a doctor, not a fortuneteller.

769
01:14:58.786 --> 01:14:59.620
This your subdural?

770
01:14:59.787 --> 01:15:00.621
Yes, that's her.

771
01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:02.206
Lot of problems, huh?

772
01:15:02.456 --> 01:15:06.043
Multiple traumas, spleen,
liver, lung, flail chest,

773
01:15:06.377 --> 01:15:08.337
left neck of femur, renal shutdown.

774
01:15:08.838 --> 01:15:11.382
Reads like a grocery list.
She salvageable?

775
01:15:11.549 --> 01:15:13.467
Yeah, sure, we got
all her signs back last night.

776
01:15:14.593 --> 01:15:16.220
- Relatives?
- The husband.

777
01:15:16.554 --> 01:15:18.347
They lost their kid. DOA.

778
01:15:19.098 --> 01:15:21.100
Listen, tell him
she's going to be all right.

779
01:15:21.767 --> 01:15:22.810
Tell him not to worry.

780
01:15:22.977 --> 01:15:24.937
Tell him if he wants, I'll talk to him.

781
01:15:25.813 --> 01:15:27.982
I don't think he wants to talk to anyone.

782
01:15:29.275 --> 01:15:31.277
He's been standing there
like a zombie all day.

783
01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:35.883
Bubba Zanetti, that you?

784
01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:38.761
You come for the grunt?

785
01:16:40.346 --> 01:16:41.972
She won't be ready till this afternoon.

786
01:16:42.681 --> 01:16:44.600
Still having trouble with the front forks.

787
01:16:45.351 --> 01:16:46.894
They're mongrels to work with.

788
01:16:48.521 --> 01:16:49.105
Hey!

789
01:16:50.564 --> 01:16:51.482
You asshole!

790
01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:53.150
What the molly fuck
you think you're doing?

791
01:16:53.317 --> 01:16:56.987
You and me are gonna talk
about the Toecutter.

792
01:16:57.696 --> 01:16:58.572
Never heard of him.

793
01:16:59.115 --> 01:17:01.867
Augh! What the Christ are you?

794
01:17:02.159 --> 01:17:03.661
I want to know about the tattoo.

795
01:17:04.161 --> 01:17:05.996
I mind my own business, don't 1?

796
01:17:06.163 --> 01:17:07.873
I mean, they'll kill me, won't they?

797
01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:26.559
I'll say the names,
and you say "yes" or "no."

798
01:17:28.102 --> 01:17:29.562
- Nightrider.
- Yes.

799
01:17:30.354 --> 01:17:33.774
- Toecutter, Bubba Zanetti.
- Yes.

800
01:17:33.941 --> 01:17:34.650
There's more?

801
01:17:35.276 --> 01:17:37.069
- It's Johnny.
- Johnny the Boy?

802
01:17:37.236 --> 01:17:39.530
Yeah. Some others.

803
01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:40.531
Where?

804
01:17:40.948 --> 01:17:42.950
Went to the beaches, looking for fuel.

805
01:17:44.201 --> 01:17:44.910
Are they coming back?

806
01:17:45.077 --> 01:17:46.745
I don't know. They gotta get their bikes.

807
01:17:47.997 --> 01:17:49.206
- What time?
- Christ's sake!

808
01:17:49.373 --> 01:17:50.916
- What time?
- I don't know.

809
01:22:08.715 --> 01:22:10.092
Code unspecified.

810
01:22:10.509 --> 01:22:13.387
We have a query locate
on a black Pursuit Special.

811
01:22:14.138 --> 01:22:16.557
Unauthorized use by a Main Force Officer.

812
01:22:17.808 --> 01:22:22.229
This is designated as
a potential Code Three Red Alert.

813
01:23:16.408 --> 01:23:17.618
Quit toying, Bubba.

814
01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:21.455
Easy. I know what I'm doing.

815
01:27:45.635 --> 01:27:46.219
Hi.

816
01:27:47.804 --> 01:27:49.306
Hey, man, this...this...

817
01:27:49.723 --> 01:27:51.850
Aw, this isn't what it looks,
man, you know, I...

818
01:27:52.309 --> 01:27:54.603
I just come down here to check it out, and

819
01:27:55.312 --> 01:27:57.314
this guy, he's already snuffed it.

820
01:27:58.231 --> 01:27:59.483
There's nothing you can do for him.

821
01:28:02.068 --> 01:28:02.694
Ankle.

822
01:28:04.738 --> 01:28:05.614
It's okay.

823
01:28:07.365 --> 01:28:07.991
On.

824
01:28:10.577 --> 01:28:11.620
What are you doing, man?

825
01:28:22.798 --> 01:28:25.967
Hey, listen, I had nothing to do with
anything going on back there, man.

826
01:28:27.803 --> 01:28:30.972
Hey, listen, man, will you?
Listen, will you listen to me?

827
01:28:31.473 --> 01:28:34.226
They were a hell of a crazy people
back there, man.

828
01:28:34.726 --> 01:28:36.102
Some kind of bad people.

829
01:28:36.269 --> 01:28:38.355
I'm not responsible for anything.

830
01:28:40.607 --> 01:28:43.860
What are you--oh!
What are you doing, man?

831
01:28:45.362 --> 01:28:48.615
What did...what did you say?
What are you doing?

832
01:28:51.034 --> 01:28:52.869
Hey, listen. I'm not a bad man.

833
01:28:53.537 --> 01:28:55.705
I'm sick, see? Like, I'm uh, I'm sick.

834
01:28:55.872 --> 01:28:57.457
What do you call it?

835
01:28:58.208 --> 01:28:59.376
Psychopathic, you know.

836
01:28:59.584 --> 01:29:00.919
Personality disorder.

837
01:29:01.086 --> 01:29:02.712
The court, man, he said so.

838
01:29:03.213 --> 01:29:05.257
You're not--you're not gonna
hurt me, are you?

839
01:29:09.427 --> 01:29:11.888
<i>Jesus! You can't kill me!</i>

840
01:29:12.681 --> 01:29:14.683
Not for stealing a man's boots!

841
01:29:16.351 --> 01:29:18.478
He was dead, for Christ's sake!

842
01:29:20.814 --> 01:29:22.399
He won't need them anymore.

843
01:29:24.568 --> 01:29:25.360
What are you doing?

844
01:29:27.779 --> 01:29:30.031
I--I wanna know what you're doing.

845
01:29:36.246 --> 01:29:39.791
The chain in those handcuffs
is high-tensile steel.

846
01:29:41.668 --> 01:29:43.712
It'd take you 10 minutes
to hack through it with this.

847
01:29:47.090 --> 01:29:49.050
Now, if you're lucky,

848
01:29:49.509 --> 01:29:51.803
you could hack through your ankle
in five minutes.

849
01:29:52.721 --> 01:29:53.346
Go.

850
01:29:55.515 --> 01:29:56.850
You're mad, man!

851
01:29:57.851 --> 01:29:59.978
You think I look silly, don't you?

852
01:30:01.605 --> 01:30:03.356
Don't bring this on me, man.

853
01:30:04.107 --> 01:30:06.318
Don't do this to me, please!

854
01:30:06.484 --> 01:30:10.447
Oh, sweet Jesus. I was sick!

855
01:30:11.573 --> 01:30:14.367
Don't bring this on me, please!
