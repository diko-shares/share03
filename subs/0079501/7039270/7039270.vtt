<i>Main Force repeats,
this is a routine pursuit. Code 44.</i>

3
00:01:17.326 --> 00:01:19.495
<i>Listen, you tell them we need some help.</i>

4
00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:22.289
<i>This should be an open-code blitz,
and you know it.</i>

5
00:01:22.456 --> 00:01:23.791
<i>You have your information.</i>

6
00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:26.585

this one's a heavyweight!</i>

<i>Main Force repeats,

8

<i>March Hare to Big Bopper.
March Hare to Big Bopper.</i>

11
00:01:38.973 --> 00:01:41.142
Big Bopper. Gotcha, Hare.
What's going down?

12
00:01:41.308 --> 00:01:44.270
<i>- We've got a cop-killer.</i>
- You're kidding!

13
00:01:47.648 --> 00:01:50.151
<i>Be warned, Sarse, this is non-compliance.</i>

14
00:01:50.317 --> 00:01:53.237
<i>The Main Force will not tolerate
such action.</i>

15
00:01:53.404 --> 00:01:57.533
<i>This is not a Code 3 red alert. This
pursuit is designated a standard Code 44.</i>

16
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.618
<i>Please respond only to that code.</i>

17
00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:03.122
<i>Code 44 indicates no requirement
for a blockade.</i>

18
00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:05.916
<i>A Pursuit Special has been stolen.</i>

19
00:02:06.083 --> 00:02:09.503
<i>Hall Captain Fifi Macaffee does not
like this any more than you.</i>

20
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.465
<i>However, we must not compromise
territorial range.</i>

21
00:02:12.757 --> 00:02:15.593
<i>Remember that only
by following instructions</i>

22
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.888
<i>can we hope to maintain
a successful highway program.</i>

23
00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:20.514
<i>Ah, Jesus!</i>

24
00:02:20.723 --> 00:02:23.934
<i>March Hare to Big Bopper.
We're three minutes off the intersection.</i>

25
00:02:24.018 --> 00:02:26.353
<i>- Reckon you can make it?</i>
- We'll make it! Move over!

26
00:02:26.437 --> 00:02:28.731
- Roop!
- I'm driving!

27
00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:30.858
Not this again! I've been assigned!

28
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.156
Wait a second, you son of a bitch.
I'm supposed to drive this heap!

29
00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:39.673
Where do you get off, huh?
Where do you get off?

30
00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:44.121
Hey, Sarse, what's the form on this guy?

31
00:02:44.288 --> 00:02:46.207
<i>A weirdo bike jockey.</i>

32
00:02:46.373 --> 00:02:48.542
<i>A few hours ago, down in Sun City,
he goes berserk.</i>

33
00:02:48.626 --> 00:02:51.926
<i>Breaks custody, wastes a rookie
and takes off in a Pursuit Special.</i>

34
00:02:52.046 --> 00:02:54.298
<i>We've been on him ever since.</i>

35
00:02:54.715 --> 00:02:56.759
<i>This one's as flaky as they come, Roop.</i>

36
00:02:56.926 --> 00:02:59.476
I've seen the style before.
It's terminal psychotic.

37
00:03:06.894 --> 00:03:07.937
What's he driving?

38
00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:10.731
<i>That's what hurts. It's one of our V8s.</i>

39
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.193
<i>Pursuit Special on methane. Super hot!</i>

40
00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.411
Okay, we're about half a mile
off Anarchy Road.

41
00:03:24.495 --> 00:03:26.580
You'll see him any minute now.

42
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.753
Rip the guts out of him!
Give it to me, Jesus!

43
00:03:38.342 --> 00:03:39.552
See him yet?

44
00:03:39.718 --> 00:03:41.178
Got it!

45
00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:44.849
- I'm gonna blow him away!
- Goddamn him!

46
00:03:45.933 --> 00:03:47.434
I'm gonna ram him!

47
00:03:51.063 --> 00:03:53.190
Move away from the passenger door.

48
00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.611
I'm gonna ram him!

49
00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:10.332
Hey, fellas, you okay?

50
00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:13.586
<i>Acknowledge, Big Bopper.
Acknowledge, are you okay?</i>

51
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.505
<i>Roop? Charlie?</i>

52
00:04:16.672 --> 00:04:19.175
Do you see me, Toecutter?

53
00:04:19.341 --> 00:04:21.385
Do you see me, man?

54
00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:27.099
Keep going. Keep going, we're okay.

55
00:04:27.975 --> 00:04:29.518
We got you, we're going.

56
00:04:34.023 --> 00:04:36.150
Born with a steering wheel in his hand,

57
00:04:36.358 --> 00:04:39.153
<i>and lead in his foot.</i>

58
00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:41.906
<i>I am the Nightrider</i>

59
00:04:42.114 --> 00:04:44.408
<i>cruising at the speed of fright!</i>

60
00:04:44.658 --> 00:04:49.455
<i>I am the Nightrider,
and I ain't never coming back!</i>

61
00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:53.125
<i>I'm a fuel-injected suicide machine!</i>

62
00:04:55.502 --> 00:05:01.258
<i>Do you hear me, pigs? Do you hear me,
Bronze pigs? Do you hear me, Bronze?</i>

63
00:05:01.425 --> 00:05:02.885
I think we're still mobile.

64
00:05:03.052 --> 00:05:05.054
For Christ's sake, shove over!

65
00:05:05.429 --> 00:05:07.139
You're blaspheming again.

66
00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:10.017
I don't have to work with a blasphemer.

67
00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:14.772
<i>Well, you missed us, pig! Hey,
big brother, this is The Nightrider...</i>

68
00:05:22.821 --> 00:05:26.116
Big Bopper to March Hare.
We're still in the game, okay?

69
00:05:26.533 --> 00:05:27.534
<i>Understand this.</i>

70
00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:30.287
That Scag and his floozie

71
00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:32.039
they're gonna die!

72
00:05:39.338 --> 00:05:42.341
<i>Code 44, standard pursuit.
Please respond.</i>

73
00:05:43.175 --> 00:05:45.344
<i>MFP to Gosling One.</i>

74
00:05:46.804 --> 00:05:49.056
<i>Come on, Goose, where are you?</i>

75
00:05:49.223 --> 00:05:50.474
It was like slow motion.

76
00:05:50.641 --> 00:05:53.185
He leaves his seat
and goes through the windshield

77
00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:55.145
headfirst straight into the tree, right,

78
00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:58.732
and then bounces back
through the windshield.

79
00:05:59.483 --> 00:06:02.569
And by the time we got to him,
he was just sitting there

80
00:06:02.736 --> 00:06:05.739
trying to scream
with his face ripped off.

81
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.326
What's the matter?

82
00:06:09.493 --> 00:06:11.078
Not hungry anymore.

83
00:06:11.245 --> 00:06:14.123
Give it here. I'll tell you what...

84
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.076
<i>Christ, they're heading for population!</i>

85
00:07:07.676 --> 00:07:09.928
Now, what's this I hear
about you and Jonathan?

86
00:07:10.012 --> 00:07:12.764
- What about him?
- You were seen with him two nights ago.

87
00:07:12.848 --> 00:07:14.308
So what?

88
00:07:17.186 --> 00:07:19.188
It's, um, this way.

89
00:07:37.831 --> 00:07:39.083
He's gone.

90
00:07:39.249 --> 00:07:40.292
Bastard!

91
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.879
Oh, shit!

92
00:07:44.463 --> 00:07:46.840
You're really gonna get it this time.
He had his indicator on.

93
00:07:46.924 --> 00:07:47.925
Shut up!

94
00:07:52.262 --> 00:07:54.681
No, no, you're not going on.
Stay off the road!

95
00:07:54.848 --> 00:07:56.433
Of course, I'm going on. Shut up!

96
00:07:56.517 --> 00:07:58.143
People's lives are in peril!

97
00:07:59.478 --> 00:08:01.688
What are you doing? You gone nuts?

98
00:08:07.277 --> 00:08:09.071
Do I have him?

99
00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:13.242
Stay off the road!

100
00:08:15.994 --> 00:08:18.330
- I got him! Shut up!
- Stay on him!

101
00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:31.677
Oh, my God.

102
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.305
Watch out!

103
00:08:45.274 --> 00:08:47.693
- Great! Down in one.
- Ha-ha-ha!

104
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.574
<i>I am ready.</i>

105
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.201
<i>I am ready for your best.</i>

106
00:08:57.953 --> 00:08:59.455
Oh, my God, what happened?

107
00:08:59.621 --> 00:09:01.721
I don't know, man. I just got here myself.

108
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.715
Main Force Patrol

109
00:09:10.007 --> 00:09:11.467
we're out of the game

110
00:09:11.633 --> 00:09:14.052
unable to continue pursuit.

111
00:09:14.845 --> 00:09:16.346
You'd better send a meat truck.

112
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.098
Charlie's been hurt bad in the throat.

113
00:09:18.182 --> 00:09:19.224
Hey, Max?

114
00:09:20.767 --> 00:09:22.561
<i>Can you hear me, Max?</i>

115
00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:24.188
Go ahead.

116
00:09:24.396 --> 00:09:26.690
<i>We are 100 percent snafued.</i>

117
00:09:26.982 --> 00:09:27.983
You okay, Goose?

118
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.819
Nothing a year in
the tropics wouldn't fix!

119
00:09:31.195 --> 00:09:32.279
Much damage?

120
00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:38.035
You should see the damage, Bronze! Huh?

121
00:09:38.202 --> 00:09:39.286
Metal damage

122
00:09:39.453 --> 00:09:41.622
<i>brain damage, huh?
You listening, Bronze?</i>

123
00:09:42.247 --> 00:09:44.291
I am the Nightrider!

124
00:09:47.085 --> 00:09:49.963
I'm a fuel-injected suicide machine.

125
00:09:51.632 --> 00:09:57.804
I am a rocker! I am a roller!
I am an out-of-controller!

126
00:09:58.805 --> 00:10:00.682
I am a Nightrider, baby,

127
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:05.521
<i>and it's me and my Marmaduke,
and we ain't never coming back.</i>

128
00:10:22.371 --> 00:10:23.830
The Toecutter

129
00:10:23.997 --> 00:10:25.457
he knows who I am.

130
00:10:25.832 --> 00:10:27.960
I am the Nightrider!

131
00:10:34.675 --> 00:10:38.387
I am the chosen one,
the mighty hand of vengeance

132
00:10:38.554 --> 00:10:42.724
<i>sent down to strike the unroadworthy!
Ha-ha-ha!</i>

133
00:10:42.891 --> 00:10:45.602
I'm hotter than a rolling dice.

134
00:10:45.769 --> 00:10:46.895
Step right up, chum,

135
00:10:47.062 --> 00:10:48.212
and watch the kid

136
00:10:48.313 --> 00:10:51.650
lay down a rubber road, right to freedom!

137
00:11:30.897 --> 00:11:33.442
What's wrong? Baby, what's wrong?

138
00:11:36.236 --> 00:11:37.571
Tell me what's wrong!

139
00:11:51.001 --> 00:11:52.252
It's going.

140
00:11:52.544 --> 00:11:56.089
There'll be nothing left. It's all gone.

141
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.307
Stop! Stop!

142
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:06.076
Ah, that feels good.

143
00:13:06.827 --> 00:13:09.830
After three days that feels so good.

144
00:13:13.083 --> 00:13:15.126
I got a right hook in the mouth
this morning.

145
00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:16.628
- Sprog?
- Mm.

146
00:13:16.795 --> 00:13:19.131
I told him to always lead with his left.

147
00:13:19.297 --> 00:13:22.092
You know, I think we've got
a monster on our hands.

148
00:13:22.259 --> 00:13:24.594
Yeah, takes after his old man.

149
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.722
- What's that?
- Monster!

150
00:13:28.849 --> 00:13:31.199
<i>Montazano,
who called himself the Nightrider</i>

151
00:13:31.351 --> 00:13:35.355
<i>had broken from custody
and escaped to the police vehicle.</i>

152
00:13:35.856 --> 00:13:38.567
- You made the news again. Hm.
- Mm.

153
00:13:39.359 --> 00:13:40.402
Who was he?

154
00:13:40.569 --> 00:13:41.611
I don't know.

155
00:13:42.904 --> 00:13:45.532
Just another glory roader, I guess.

156
00:14:10.682 --> 00:14:12.434
Jessie, I told you.

157
00:14:12.601 --> 00:14:14.269
The Goose wants me there early.

158
00:14:14.436 --> 00:14:15.979
What for, he didn't say.

159
00:14:16.146 --> 00:14:17.731
You know the Goose.

160
00:14:18.398 --> 00:14:20.150
Coffee's ready.

161
00:14:44.049 --> 00:14:45.717
I'm not grumpy.

162
00:14:52.432 --> 00:14:54.434
Get out of here.

163
00:14:57.312 --> 00:14:58.396
Okay.

164
00:14:59.189 --> 00:15:00.440
I gotta go.

165
00:15:11.493 --> 00:15:12.953
Hey!

166
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.006
What's that?

167
00:15:26.258 --> 00:15:27.884
Crazy about you.

168
00:15:43.483 --> 00:15:46.027
<i>Penalties against pirate towing-operators</i>

179

181
00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:34.367
Kick it in the guts, Barry.

182
00:16:39.205 --> 00:16:41.875
She's the last of the V8s.

183
00:16:42.042 --> 00:16:44.792
You can shut the gate on this one.
It's the Duck's guts.

184
00:16:44.878 --> 00:16:46.546
Yeah, she's the last of the V8s.

185
00:16:46.796 --> 00:16:48.381
Sucks nitro.

- Six hundred horsepower.

188
00:16:53.053 --> 00:16:55.931
The Blower! The Blower, man!

189
00:16:59.976 --> 00:17:02.771
- He's in a coma, man!
- He loves it.

190
00:17:13.365 --> 00:17:14.908
Okay.

191
00:17:15.575 --> 00:17:17.786
How the hell did you
get all this together?

192
00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:21.915
It just happened, Max, you know?

193
00:17:22.082 --> 00:17:24.793
A piece from here and a piece from there.

194
00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.212
- So easy?
- Yeah.

195
00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:32.842
Come on, Max. You've seen it, you've heard
it, and you're still asking questions?

<i>Code Samurai 1, progress 46

198
00:17:40.183 --> 00:17:41.518
<i>Animal!</i>

199
00:17:44.729 --> 00:17:46.398
I think we've got him.

200
00:17:46.564 --> 00:17:47.774
I hope so.

201
00:17:47.941 --> 00:17:49.359
Yeah, we've got him.

202
00:17:49.526 --> 00:17:51.736
Your top pursuit man wants
to quit the road,

203
00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.447
and we have to seduce him with candy?

204
00:17:54.698 --> 00:17:57.283
People don't believe in heroes anymore.

205
00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:01.579
I know, Macaffee.
You want to give them back their heroes.

206
00:18:01.746 --> 00:18:03.456
You will not try this one on me again.

207
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.375
I do not enjoy wasting money.

208
00:18:05.542 --> 00:18:07.085
Goodbye,

209
00:18:08.003 --> 00:18:09.838
and good luck!

210
00:18:10.422 --> 00:18:12.007
Thanks, Labatouche

211
00:18:12.465 --> 00:18:14.843
you're a real human being.

212
00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.619
Shut up! Get out of here!

213
00:18:42.037 --> 00:18:43.246
Get out of my way!

214
00:18:43.413 --> 00:18:45.122
The old meat grinder's
humming tonight, eh?

215
00:18:45.206 --> 00:18:48.918
Yeah, Max took out a couple
of crazies just now, that's all.

216
00:18:50.378 --> 00:18:52.047
Hey, shut up!

217
00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:02.432
Hey, Max, another one for your books, eh?
You eaten yet?

218
00:19:02.599 --> 00:19:04.600
No, not yet. I'll pick up something later.

219
00:19:04.684 --> 00:19:07.854
Hey, that, um, Code 3
you ran down a few days ago.

220
00:19:08.021 --> 00:19:09.814
- The Nightrider?
- The Nightrider, yeah.

221
00:19:09.898 --> 00:19:11.315
- Got a problem.
- What's that?

222
00:19:11.399 --> 00:19:13.818
Well, his friends.
Word is they're out to get you.

223
00:19:13.902 --> 00:19:15.528
- Scoot jockeys?
- Yeah, nomad trash.

224
00:19:15.612 --> 00:19:18.239
Hmm.
Well, I'll add it to my threat collection.

225
00:19:18.406 --> 00:19:21.493
Ha, ha. Good boy, Max. You're a good boy.

226
00:19:21.785 --> 00:19:22.952
Hey, come on.

227
00:21:21.112 --> 00:21:22.363
Good afternoon.

228
00:21:23.323 --> 00:21:24.824
Good afternoon.

229
00:21:25.408 --> 00:21:28.953
We're here to meet a friend.
Coming on the train.

230
00:21:29.662 --> 00:21:33.583
Nothing coming on the train
except a couple of crates and a, heh

231
00:21:33.958 --> 00:21:35.293
coffin.

232
00:21:36.252 --> 00:21:37.962
Our friend.

233
00:21:38.838 --> 00:21:41.633
You'll have to see the agent
and sign the papers.

234
00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:43.760
Where do we find

235
00:21:44.093 --> 00:21:45.178
this agent?

236
00:21:47.722 --> 00:21:48.765
Wait.

237
00:22:04.822 --> 00:22:06.615
That must be your friend over there.

238
00:22:06.699 --> 00:22:08.660
Didn't leave much of him.

239
00:22:08.826 --> 00:22:11.996
Must have cut his heart out, huh?

240
00:22:15.208 --> 00:22:17.293
Yeah. That's what I meant.

241
00:22:19.379 --> 00:22:21.089
Poor bastard.

242
00:22:22.423 --> 00:22:24.550
The Nightrider

243
00:22:26.511 --> 00:22:28.471
that is his name.

244
00:22:28.638 --> 00:22:31.808
The Nightrider.

245
00:22:32.433 --> 00:22:34.394
The Nightrider.

246
00:22:35.687 --> 00:22:37.188
Remember him

247
00:22:37.355 --> 00:22:40.066
when you look at the night sky.

248
00:22:41.067 --> 00:22:42.527
I will.

249
00:22:43.987 --> 00:22:46.030
Take your hat off.

250
00:23:01.504 --> 00:23:03.006
Anything you say.

251
00:23:03.172 --> 00:23:05.008
Anything I say.

252
00:23:06.884 --> 00:23:09.095
What a wonderful philosophy you have.

253
00:23:09.262 --> 00:23:10.305
Take him away.

254
00:23:19.981 --> 00:23:22.608
Bubba. Johnny.

255
00:24:04.067 --> 00:24:05.526
Whoo!

256
00:24:05.693 --> 00:24:06.736
Oh!

257
00:24:07.111 --> 00:24:12.950
- Push me, shove you!
- Oh, yeah? Says who?

258
00:24:13.117 --> 00:24:17.372
Push me, shove you,
push me, shove you, push me, shove you!

259
00:24:30.968 --> 00:24:34.722
Come on! Nightrider!

260
00:24:40.686 --> 00:24:42.355
Nightrider!

261
00:25:25.398 --> 00:25:27.191
Don't worry.

262
00:27:18.553 --> 00:27:20.888
Anyway, my name is Jim Goose.

263
00:27:22.515 --> 00:27:24.016

<i>Nomad bikers, bulk trouble.</i>

266
00:27:28.271 --> 00:27:30.690
Okay, we're on it. We're going.

267
00:27:31.065 --> 00:27:32.441
Goose, let's go.

268
00:27:32.608 --> 00:27:34.986
So long. Sorry, we gotta go.

269
00:27:39.073 --> 00:27:40.533
What's this?

270
00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.785
It's a get-out-of-jail-free card.

271
00:27:59.093 --> 00:28:01.971
- Any more details?
<i>- No.</i>

272
00:28:03.097 --> 00:28:05.099
Okay, we're going.

273
00:28:06.976 --> 00:28:08.894
- Max, see what I see?
- Yeah.

274
00:28:13.024 --> 00:28:14.609
Hey, fella, stop!

275
00:28:16.277 --> 00:28:17.320
Hey, fella!

276
00:28:18.154 --> 00:28:19.614
Ah.

277
00:28:20.031 --> 00:28:21.532
Hey, fella, stop!

278
00:28:24.076 --> 00:28:25.911
What a turkey!

279
00:28:26.579 --> 00:28:29.415
Hey, fella, you're a turkey,
you know that?

280
00:28:29.582 --> 00:28:32.251
We'll come back for him later.
There's more up ahead.

281
00:28:36.213 --> 00:28:38.299
Nightrider.

282
00:28:39.008 --> 00:28:41.302
Nightrider.

283
00:29:07.161 --> 00:29:09.288
See to her.

284
00:29:13.042 --> 00:29:14.585
Bronze!

285
00:29:15.211 --> 00:29:17.213
Gonna get you!

286
00:29:17.922 --> 00:29:19.173
Okay.

287
00:29:21.008 --> 00:29:23.469
It's all right. No one's gonna hurt you.

288
00:29:24.553 --> 00:29:25.638
It's all right.

289
00:29:25.805 --> 00:29:27.605
This one's whacked out of his skull.

290
00:29:27.723 --> 00:29:29.975
Whacked right out of his skull, man!

291
00:29:30.142 --> 00:29:32.269
He ain't never coming back. Whoo!

292
00:29:43.531 --> 00:29:44.699
It's all right.

293
00:29:45.408 --> 00:29:46.659
It's all right.

294
00:29:48.369 --> 00:29:50.204
I'm gonna let this go now.

295
00:29:54.041 --> 00:29:56.210
I know you're a frightened girl,

296
00:29:56.419 --> 00:29:58.421

297

300
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:19.900
The Nightrider!

301
00:30:20.234 --> 00:30:21.819
- Hey, Jimbo.
- Yeah?

302
00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.489
- Remember that Code 3?
- Yeah, sure.

303
00:30:26.073 --> 00:30:28.242
Remember him when you look up!

304
00:30:28.451 --> 00:30:30.369
When you look...

305
00:30:31.871 --> 00:30:33.789
Nightrider!

306
00:30:35.166 --> 00:30:37.501
Well, well, well!

307
00:31:01.817 --> 00:31:04.862
Johnny the Boy is still at the wreck.

308
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:06.238
Stoned again.

309
00:31:06.447 --> 00:31:08.407
He's never gonna learn.

310
00:31:10.743 --> 00:31:13.537
But we are going to teach him, Bubba.

311
00:31:13.704 --> 00:31:16.290
You are going back for him.

312
00:31:16.457 --> 00:31:18.959
No way! Not me, not for him!

313
00:31:20.294 --> 00:31:21.837
But it's not for him.

314
00:31:22.213 --> 00:31:23.839
It's for me, Bubba.

315
00:31:31.096 --> 00:31:34.016
You're wasting your time!
The Scag don't rate!

316
00:31:34.183 --> 00:31:36.894
He's nothing like the Nightrider!

317
00:32:09.593 --> 00:32:11.679
<i>MFP Code 1.</i>

Hey, mister!

320
00:32:32.741 --> 00:32:34.827
What happened to the car?

321
00:32:34.994 --> 00:32:36.954
What do you think happened?

322
00:32:37.705 --> 00:32:40.291
Looks like it was chewed up and spat out.

323
00:32:41.417 --> 00:32:44.295
Perhaps it was the result of anxiety.

324
00:32:45.421 --> 00:32:46.672
Hey, Roop.

325
00:32:46.839 --> 00:32:48.132
Stay here, man.

326
00:32:57.224 --> 00:32:59.643
I think they're out there.

327
00:33:00.102 --> 00:33:03.230
Take your time, Charlie.
We got plenty of it.

328
00:33:07.067 --> 00:33:09.945
I can see the Interceptor.

329
00:33:17.119 --> 00:33:18.787
What do you say, Scag?

330
00:33:18.954 --> 00:33:21.415
Got no place special to go, huh?

331
00:33:21.749 --> 00:33:23.500
We'd better prep him.

332
00:33:24.251 --> 00:33:26.670
Scag, did you bring your toothbrush?

333
00:33:29.673 --> 00:33:31.842
- You'll have to sit on the Goose.
- Why?

334
00:33:32.009 --> 00:33:34.219
- No contest.
- Damn!

335
00:33:52.112 --> 00:33:54.031
Hey, Fif! What's going on?

336
00:33:54.198 --> 00:33:55.323
- What happened?
- Let him go.

337
00:33:55.407 --> 00:33:57.407
What's he mean, "Let him go"?
Who's this?

338
00:33:57.493 --> 00:33:59.327
- Keep out of this.
- What's going on?

339
00:33:59.411 --> 00:34:00.621
No one showed, okay?

340
00:34:00.788 --> 00:34:03.207
Forget it, Charlie. Just let him go.

341
00:34:03.916 --> 00:34:05.542
No one showed. No one.

342
00:34:05.751 --> 00:34:07.670
What's he mean, "No one showed"?

343
00:34:07.878 --> 00:34:09.296
They didn't show.

344
00:34:09.463 --> 00:34:12.049
Nobody! The punks didn't show.

345
00:34:12.216 --> 00:34:14.666
The girl didn't show,
the townspeople didn't show.

346
00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:16.553
Nobody showed!

347
00:34:16.887 --> 00:34:18.513
- We're screwed!
- Don't touch me!

348
00:34:18.597 --> 00:34:21.224
What do you mean, "No one showed"?
Where were you, man?

349
00:34:21.308 --> 00:34:24.478
It means, old man,
you haven't got a case. No contest.

350
00:34:24.645 --> 00:34:27.856
Jesus Christ! You're not gonna
let him walk out the door, Fifi?

351
00:34:28.023 --> 00:34:29.608
That's exactly what you'll do!

352
00:34:29.775 --> 00:34:32.695
- Shut up, Ralphie!
- Keep going, Charlie! Keep going!

353
00:34:34.071 --> 00:34:37.449
Hey, Bronze, look at you

354
00:34:37.658 --> 00:34:39.243
a cripple and a mute!

355
00:34:39.910 --> 00:34:41.912
He sings, and I tap-dance!

356
00:34:42.997 --> 00:34:46.166
Hey, you know what you are?
You are, you're a...

357
00:34:46.333 --> 00:34:50.733
The courts will hear about this, I promise
you! The courts will hear about this disgrace!

358
00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:55.216
- This man is grossly offensive!
- Out of my way!

359
00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:56.550
Get him out of here, Max!

360
00:34:56.635 --> 00:34:59.638
- I can make a case of it!
- No one filed a complaint!

361
00:34:59.805 --> 00:35:01.555
You saw what they did to that girl!

362
00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:03.892
For God's sake, she was the town pump!

363
00:35:06.562 --> 00:35:09.648
He's my prisoner,
and he's not walking out that door!

364
00:35:09.815 --> 00:35:11.025
Get him out of here!

365
00:35:11.191 --> 00:35:12.234
Who is this guy?

366
00:35:12.401 --> 00:35:14.319
Goose, settle down, boy.

367
00:35:15.154 --> 00:35:16.405
Come on, boy.

368
00:35:20.826 --> 00:35:22.828
Look, they're laughing at us!

369
00:35:22.995 --> 00:35:26.540
Can't you see they're laughing at us?
I don't believe this!

370
00:35:29.043 --> 00:35:32.004
See you later, Goose.
It's been a pleasure.

371
00:36:00.532 --> 00:36:04.078
Get in the car, go home.
We don't want you around here.

372
00:36:04.328 --> 00:36:05.496
Hey, Goose!

373
00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.956
You can't do anything about it!

374
00:36:08.123 --> 00:36:10.417
We know who you are, Bronze!

375
00:36:10.584 --> 00:36:12.836
We'll see you on the road, Scag!

376
00:36:13.003 --> 00:36:15.547
See you on the road,
like we saw the Nightrider!

377
00:36:15.714 --> 00:36:20.427
We remember the Nightrider,
and we know who you are!

378
00:36:27.017 --> 00:36:28.519
Okay.

379
00:36:28.685 --> 00:36:33.232
So long as the paperwork is clean,
you boys can do what you like out there.

380
00:36:37.736 --> 00:36:42.241
Here he is, the walking armpit! Ha-ha-ha!

381
00:36:50.874 --> 00:36:53.835
There's a fire in my belly,
and she's the woman to put it out.

382
00:36:53.919 --> 00:36:55.920
Off, brute, this angel's hot in
the tubes for me!

383
00:36:56.004 --> 00:36:58.298
Yee-ha!

384
00:37:02.094 --> 00:37:04.138
I'm on fire!

385
00:37:04.388 --> 00:37:06.431
Joviality is a game of children.

386
00:37:06.974 --> 00:37:10.561
She's mine. I should have been
a surgeon with these hands.

387
00:37:14.731 --> 00:37:17.526
Mudguts, get out of there!

388
00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:22.656
Cundalini, put her against the post.

389
00:37:29.163 --> 00:37:30.998
We have a problem here.

390
00:37:31.957 --> 00:37:34.501
She is not what she seems.

391
00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:38.297
Bubba Zanetti has it on good authority

392
00:37:39.089 --> 00:37:42.759
she's sent by the Bronze,
full of treachery.

393
00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:50.184
The Bronze kill our pride.

394
00:38:01.737 --> 00:38:05.824
If you're going to waste the Bronze,
you gotta do it big!

395
00:38:06.325 --> 00:38:09.661
You just don't have the style,
do you, chicken shit?

396
00:38:11.955 --> 00:38:14.708
Goes to water on a dummy.

397
00:38:22.466 --> 00:38:25.385
It's all right, you'll get your chance!

398
00:38:25.552 --> 00:38:27.137
You'll get your chance.

399
00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:31.099
It's all right. Hm? It's okay.

400
00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:33.518
It's okay.

401
00:38:33.685 --> 00:38:35.979
Just remember

402
00:38:36.897 --> 00:38:38.899
to keep your sweet

403
00:38:39.316 --> 00:38:43.278
sweet mouth shut!

404
00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:07.761
Whoo!

405
00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:35.539
<i>Gosling One. Code 3 in progress.</i>

406
00:39:37.374 --> 00:39:39.626
<i>We have a curfew violation.</i>

407
00:39:39.876 --> 00:39:44.131
<i>Lookin' for some juice
On this side of town</i>

408
00:39:44.298 --> 00:39:46.675
<i>Mister, won't you show the way?</i>

409
00:39:46.842 --> 00:39:48.969
<i>Tryin' to get around</i>

410
00:39:49.136 --> 00:39:52.639
<i>Only one thought left Makes me come alive</i>

411
00:39:52.806 --> 00:39:55.976
<i>And that is you and me side by side</i>

412
00:39:56.143 --> 00:39:58.520
<i>On the licorice ride</i>

413
00:39:58.687 --> 00:40:03.358
<i>Motorbikes and leather men
Take me to the edge of the dream</i>

414
00:40:03.525 --> 00:40:05.736
<i>Hold on tight Though, it sure feels right</i>

415
00:40:05.902 --> 00:40:11.033
<i>Stick to you like a tie on a licorice ride</i>

416
00:40:13.201 --> 00:40:15.329
Yeah, baby.

417
00:40:54.701 --> 00:40:57.537
<i>Welcome, Main Force units,
to three day Angel Patrol.</i>

418
00:40:57.704 --> 00:41:00.207
<i>Nice to have you back, Big Boppa Two.</i>

419
00:43:35.153 --> 00:43:36.655
MFP, copy.

420
00:43:38.073 --> 00:43:39.491
MFP, copy.

421
00:43:39.658 --> 00:43:42.160
Hey, hey, hey, hey, it's the Goose.

422
00:43:48.166 --> 00:43:51.503
You're a lucky boy.
Didn't even get road rash.

423
00:43:52.671 --> 00:43:54.256
Hey, Midge

424
00:43:54.714 --> 00:43:56.048
don't write off the Goose

425
00:43:56.132 --> 00:43:58.927
until you see the box
going into the hole.

426
00:44:00.095 --> 00:44:02.180
Yeah, well don't wreck my truck now.

427
00:44:02.347 --> 00:44:05.392
- I'll bring it back tomorrow.
- Yeah, no hurry.

428
00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.061
Hey, sure you're all right?

429
00:44:08.687 --> 00:44:10.897
Couldn't be righter.

430
00:44:11.356 --> 00:44:15.318
Jimmy the Goose,
larger than life and twice as ugly!

431
00:45:38.318 --> 00:45:40.153
Light me, Johnny.

432
00:46:01.216 --> 00:46:03.218
Light another.

433
00:46:04.511 --> 00:46:05.762
Hey.

434
00:46:08.473 --> 00:46:11.476
This is the threshold moment, Johnny.
Step through.

435
00:46:11.643 --> 00:46:14.104
Toecutter, this isn't what I want.

436
00:46:14.813 --> 00:46:18.108
Light it! Light it, Johnny, for me.

437
00:46:21.111 --> 00:46:24.739
The Bronze,
they keep you from being proud.

438
00:46:26.032 --> 00:46:29.160
Look at him. He looks silly,
doesn't he, upside down?

439
00:46:31.287 --> 00:46:34.082
Do it for freedom and the Nightrider!

440
00:46:34.249 --> 00:46:35.542
- I can't!
- Throw it!

441
00:46:35.709 --> 00:46:39.087
- No!
- You scum-sucking trash!

442
00:46:39.254 --> 00:46:42.298
Throw it!

443
00:47:16.666 --> 00:47:18.501
Max. Max.

444
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:20.128
Max.

445
00:48:15.558 --> 00:48:17.644
Max! Hey, Max.

446
00:48:18.686 --> 00:48:21.064
That thing in there

447
00:48:21.231 --> 00:48:23.191
that's not the Goose. No way!

448
00:49:29.424 --> 00:49:31.259
I was hungry.

449
00:49:33.303 --> 00:49:35.221
Peanut butter and honey.

450
00:49:50.612 --> 00:49:53.364
I just can't get it clear in my head,
Jess.

451
00:49:55.575 --> 00:49:59.245
He was so full of living, you know.
He ran the franchise on it.

452
00:50:00.955 --> 00:50:02.916
Now there's nothing.

453
00:50:05.627 --> 00:50:08.713
Here I am trying to put sense to it

454
00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.965
when I know there isn't any.

455
00:50:15.345 --> 00:50:18.348
I'll be all right,
once I get it clear in my head.

456
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:32.654
<i>All vehicle repairs
must be authorized by the Hall Captains.</i>

457
00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:36.157
<i>Officers may not deal directly
with underground mechanics.</i>

458
00:50:36.324 --> 00:50:38.326
<i>Doing so is an offense.</i>

459
00:50:41.204 --> 00:50:42.497
Fif.

460
00:50:43.831 --> 00:50:45.083
Fif.

461
00:50:48.336 --> 00:50:50.922
- What's this?
- I'm through.

462
00:50:51.089 --> 00:50:52.340
- Again?
- No, not again.

463
00:50:52.507 --> 00:50:54.801
- I'm through. I'm quitting.
- Sit down.

464
00:50:54.968 --> 00:50:58.888
No, I didn't come here to discuss it,
I came to say it. I'm through.

465
00:50:59.305 --> 00:51:00.807
Now just a minute!

466
00:51:02.684 --> 00:51:04.018
So the Goose bought it.

467
00:51:04.185 --> 00:51:06.228
But that's the way
he always came at the world.

468
00:51:06.312 --> 00:51:07.522
You're wrong.

469
00:51:07.689 --> 00:51:10.775
Max, you'd be the first to admit
it was long overdue.

470
00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:13.903
All right, I'll tell you how it is.

471
00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:16.030
You're a winner, Max.

472
00:51:16.406 --> 00:51:21.160
You're the top shelf, and I won't lose you
because of some crazy notion about quitting!

473
00:51:24.288 --> 00:51:27.875
They say that people don't believe
in heroes anymore.

474
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:30.253
Well, damn them!

475
00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:32.255
You and me, Max

476
00:51:32.964 --> 00:51:35.258
we're gonna give them back their heroes.

477
00:51:35.425 --> 00:51:39.512
Ah, Fif, do you really expect me
to go for that crap?

478
00:51:40.304 --> 00:51:43.433
You gotta admit, I sounded
good there for a minute, eh?

479
00:51:43.599 --> 00:51:44.642
Bye, Fifi.

480
00:51:45.184 --> 00:51:48.229
Hey, come on, do you want me to beg?

481
00:51:48.855 --> 00:51:50.690
Do you want me on my knees crying?

482
00:51:51.065 --> 00:51:53.901
- Ha, ha.
- Now just a minute...

483
00:51:54.068 --> 00:51:55.278
Give me a reason.

484
00:51:59.741 --> 00:52:01.784
- I'm scared, Fif.
- Ugh.

485
00:52:02.368 --> 00:52:05.413
Do you know why?
It's that rat circus out there.

486
00:52:05.788 --> 00:52:07.088
I'm beginning to enjoy it.

487
00:52:07.206 --> 00:52:08.624
What is this, funny week?

488
00:52:08.791 --> 00:52:11.794
Any longer out on that road,
and I'm one of them, you know?

489
00:52:11.961 --> 00:52:13.671
A terminal crazy.

490
00:52:14.005 --> 00:52:16.924
Only, I've got a bronze badge
to say I'm one of the good guys.

491
00:52:17.008 --> 00:52:18.608
You know what I'm trying to say?

492
00:52:20.553 --> 00:52:22.055
I'll tell you what I'll do.

493
00:52:27.351 --> 00:52:29.103
Take off a few weeks, huh?

494
00:52:30.146 --> 00:52:32.106
Grow yourself a beard.

495
00:52:32.482 --> 00:52:35.276
Draw flies.
Just think about it for a while.

496
00:52:35.443 --> 00:52:38.821
If you still feel the same way when
you come back, that's okay by me.

497
00:52:38.905 --> 00:52:40.031
Go on.

498
00:52:45.828 --> 00:52:47.705
I'm not gonna change my mind.

499
00:52:47.872 --> 00:52:51.834
Get out of here, before I decide
to come with you, huh? Ha, ha.

500
00:52:52.001 --> 00:52:54.462
Bye, Fif. Thanks.

501
00:52:58.132 --> 00:53:00.384
You'll be back, Rockatansky!

502
00:53:01.761 --> 00:53:03.012
You're hooked, Max,

503
00:53:03.596 --> 00:53:04.639
and you know it!

504
00:54:10.788 --> 00:54:15.376
I've never been able to say things to you,
Jess. About how I feel.

505
00:54:17.795 --> 00:54:20.381
Guess I always counted
on you understanding.

506
00:54:28.139 --> 00:54:29.974
When I was a kid

507
00:54:30.516 --> 00:54:33.853
me and my father used to go
for long walks.

508
00:54:37.148 --> 00:54:39.400
I remember staring down at his shoes.

509
00:54:41.068 --> 00:54:44.238
They were special shoes. Brown.

510
00:54:45.198 --> 00:54:48.075
And he always kept them real shiny.

511
00:54:50.203 --> 00:54:54.665
He was tall,
and he used to take long strides.

512
00:54:55.791 --> 00:54:58.419
And there I'd be right alongside him

513
00:54:58.794 --> 00:55:00.922
just trying to keep up with him.

514
00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:09.347
I don't think he ever knew
how proud I felt of him.

515
00:55:11.599 --> 00:55:14.602
Or how good it felt
just to be there alongside him.

516
00:55:17.563 --> 00:55:20.608
Even now, when I think back on it,
I still feel...

517
00:55:25.029 --> 00:55:27.114
The thing is, Jess

518
00:55:28.616 --> 00:55:32.453
I couldn't tell him about it then,
but I can tell you about it now.

519
00:55:36.207 --> 00:55:40.461
I don't wanna wait 10 years to tell you
how I'm feeling about you right now.

520
00:56:06.696 --> 00:56:07.780
Hello?

521
00:56:08.239 --> 00:56:10.950
- Get a load of that!
- We had a blowout a while back.

522
00:56:11.117 --> 00:56:14.537
Raunchy, very raunchy.
Is the motor okay?

523
00:56:14.704 --> 00:56:17.206
Yeah, the motor's fine.
Look, about this tire...

524
00:56:17.373 --> 00:56:20.873
Don't do much work on these myself,
except to scrape them off the road.

525
00:56:21.002 --> 00:56:24.252
- Yeah. Hey, how about this tire, huh?
- Have it fixed in no time.

526
00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:26.840
I can sell you a set of Dunlops
for next to nothing.

527
00:56:26.924 --> 00:56:29.343
- No, thanks.
- I can't remember where I got them,

528
00:56:29.427 --> 00:56:31.136
but I got them, know what I mean?

529
00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:34.557
No, we'll be all right
just as soon as we get this fixed.

530
00:56:34.765 --> 00:56:36.267
- Max?
- Yeah?

531
00:56:37.852 --> 00:56:38.936
Listen

532
00:56:39.812 --> 00:56:42.773
Sproggo's talked me
into buying him an ice cream, so

533
00:56:43.441 --> 00:56:45.109
I think I'll see you later.

534
00:56:45.276 --> 00:56:47.903
Sure, there's a shop just down the beach.

535
00:56:48.404 --> 00:56:49.947
They'll appreciate the business.

536
00:56:50.031 --> 00:56:52.033
Sure, thanks.

537
00:56:52.491 --> 00:56:54.327
Toodle pip.

538
00:56:56.746 --> 00:56:58.039
Bye.

539
00:57:07.757 --> 00:57:11.052
You just trucking around?
Good time for just trucking.

540
00:57:11.635 --> 00:57:14.597
Wish I could do a bit myself.
Which way you heading? North?

541
00:57:14.764 --> 00:57:16.265
Uh, maybe.

542
00:57:46.337 --> 00:57:48.672
Look what's turned up for Sunday dinner.

543
00:57:49.715 --> 00:57:52.426
Main course and dessert.

544
00:57:53.010 --> 00:57:54.929
My favorite kind

545
00:57:55.596 --> 00:57:57.181
female.

546
00:58:32.967 --> 00:58:34.760
Mm.

547
00:58:37.555 --> 00:58:41.809
Watch the tongue, sweetheart.
I've seen him lick his eyebrow clean.

548
00:59:13.257 --> 00:59:15.092
You must've spent some loot.

549
00:59:15.384 --> 00:59:18.846
Like the sign says,
speed's just a question of money.

550
00:59:19.013 --> 00:59:20.973
How fast do you wanna go?

551
00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:22.940
- Max, quick, get in.
- What's wrong?

552
00:59:23.058 --> 00:59:24.810
Just take my word for it, get in!

553
00:59:24.977 --> 00:59:27.563
- What about the tire?
- Please, Max!

554
00:59:30.107 --> 00:59:31.650
Your tire, man!

555
00:59:32.443 --> 00:59:33.861
Hey, fella!

556
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:35.738
Watch your tire!

557
00:59:39.116 --> 00:59:40.701
Crazy people!

558
00:59:41.118 --> 00:59:43.329
The world's full of crazy people.

559
01:00:00.971 --> 01:00:02.848
That wagon, was it here?

560
01:00:03.015 --> 01:00:04.266
Sure, a couple with a kid.

561
01:00:04.350 --> 01:00:06.017
- Who are they?
- I was just fixing their tire.

562
01:00:06.101 --> 01:00:10.564
They left their goddamn spare.
Not a bad one either. Ha, ha.

563
01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:12.858
- Who are they?
- A couple

564
01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:16.862
passing through.
Said they were heading north. Maybe.

565
01:00:29.833 --> 01:00:31.585
You want to drive the car? No?

566
01:00:31.752 --> 01:00:34.922
You'd rather play with the ball?
Into the back.

567
01:00:35.089 --> 01:00:36.465
There you go.

568
01:00:38.008 --> 01:00:41.804
I can still see his face now.
Looked as if he'd just swallowed a brick.

569
01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:44.848
What a mean old lady you are.
Huh, Sproggy?

570
01:00:45.015 --> 01:00:47.351
- That's enough from you, mate!
- The dog.

571
01:00:53.023 --> 01:00:55.025
What's the matter with you?

572
01:00:58.779 --> 01:01:00.698
What you got there, pal?

573
01:01:04.076 --> 01:01:05.494
Max!

574
01:01:10.457 --> 01:01:13.252
Yeah, yeah, that's the way I see it too.

575
01:01:13.544 --> 01:01:16.547
Yep. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

576
01:01:16.714 --> 01:01:19.967
Sure. It's been nice talking to you. Bye.

577
01:01:21.468 --> 01:01:22.886
Take it you agreed with him.

578
01:01:23.053 --> 01:01:25.653
- If they're not worried, I'm not.
- What about that?

579
01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:29.435
I figure it's lost property.

580
01:01:29.602 --> 01:01:32.896
If no one makes a claim to it,
I say we can forget it.

581
01:01:34.857 --> 01:01:36.859
Sounds okay to me, Jess.

582
01:01:37.026 --> 01:01:38.444
Don't know.

583
01:01:38.611 --> 01:01:42.072
If Ziggy says so, believe me, it's okay.

584
01:01:42.406 --> 01:01:45.034
Now, May's expecting you up at the farm.

585
01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:49.663
You'll have no more trouble up there.
Just green grass and fat cows.

586
01:02:22.112 --> 01:02:25.366
- How are you doing?
- Mm. I'm getting there.

587
01:02:32.539 --> 01:02:36.710
I reckon you ought to connect
the doohickey to the gizmo.

588
01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.215
Come here, you.

589
01:02:41.382 --> 01:02:44.301
You touch me with those hands
and I'll rip you apart. No!

590
01:02:44.468 --> 01:02:46.220
No, look at them!

591
01:02:46.387 --> 01:02:48.889
- No! No!
- You gonna give me a hug?

592
01:02:49.056 --> 01:02:50.099
No, no...

593
01:03:05.823 --> 01:03:08.325
May told me about the little beach
down by the trees.

594
01:03:08.409 --> 01:03:10.035
- Mm.
- Do you want to come?

595
01:03:10.911 --> 01:03:12.204
Love to

596
01:03:12.371 --> 01:03:16.458
except that I've gotta fix the fan belt,
or we're never gonna get out of here.

597
01:03:16.625 --> 01:03:19.253
Okay, Tarzan,
I'll bring you back some bananas.

598
01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:20.754
All right.

599
01:03:32.683 --> 01:03:34.143
Hey!

600
01:03:54.371 --> 01:03:58.459
Jessie. If you meet Benno down there,
don't let him bother you.

601
01:03:58.625 --> 01:04:00.627
He's only a baby.

602
01:04:02.379 --> 01:04:04.047
Sure, May.

603
01:04:38.916 --> 01:04:40.000
Here, boy.

604
01:07:50.524 --> 01:07:52.526
Jessie, Jessie, wait a minute.

605
01:07:52.734 --> 01:07:55.696
Calm down, now,
and tell me what's the matter.

606
01:07:55.904 --> 01:07:57.823
Very, very naughty.

607
01:07:57.990 --> 01:08:00.575
- Now you tell May what you...
- May.

608
01:08:00.784 --> 01:08:04.496
May, you go and call Ziggy.
Call Ziggy,

609
01:08:04.663 --> 01:08:07.124
and tell him to get here
as fast as he can.

610
01:08:07.290 --> 01:08:08.875
Why, what's going on?

611
01:08:09.042 --> 01:08:12.713
I think we've got some biker trouble.
It's gonna be all right.

612
01:08:12.879 --> 01:08:17.217
Come on, darling. Come on, Jessie.
Well, let's go into the house.

613
01:08:18.552 --> 01:08:21.513
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right.

614
01:08:30.731 --> 01:08:34.067
You've had an awful time, darling,

615
01:08:34.818 --> 01:08:37.571
but it's all over now.

616
01:08:37.946 --> 01:08:40.907
Everything's going to be all right.

617
01:08:45.370 --> 01:08:47.956
I've just got to go
and make a phone call,

618
01:08:48.331 --> 01:08:51.918
and then we'll have
a nice hot cup of tea, huh?

619
01:09:09.936 --> 01:09:13.023
Get me Ziggy, and hurry it up, will you?

620
01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:15.776
It's May Swaisey.

621
01:09:23.116 --> 01:09:25.410
Sprog? Oh, no.

622
01:09:35.545 --> 01:09:36.755
Sprog?

623
01:09:40.342 --> 01:09:41.718
Sprog!

624
01:09:46.223 --> 01:09:47.724
Sprog!

625
01:09:55.774 --> 01:09:57.234
Sprog!

626
01:10:05.158 --> 01:10:06.701
Sprog!

627
01:10:10.997 --> 01:10:12.791
Well, well.

628
01:10:13.416 --> 01:10:15.544
It's our little mother.

629
01:10:19.548 --> 01:10:21.842
That there is Cundalini,

630
01:10:22.384 --> 01:10:25.137
and Cundalini wants his hand back.

631
01:10:27.139 --> 01:10:29.182
I... I want my baby.

632
01:10:29.516 --> 01:10:31.351
Tell you what

633
01:10:32.102 --> 01:10:33.145
I'll swap you.

634
01:10:34.896 --> 01:10:38.316
- Please, give me my baby.
- Jessie.

635
01:10:39.442 --> 01:10:41.778
Jessie, Jessie.

636
01:10:42.362 --> 01:10:44.865
You've not got a sense of humor.

637
01:10:46.032 --> 01:10:49.536
You've got a pretty face, though,
awful pretty.

638
01:10:50.245 --> 01:10:52.706
Yeah, awful pretty.

639
01:10:53.165 --> 01:10:56.918
I suppose you don't need
a sense of humor with a pretty face.

640
01:10:58.044 --> 01:11:00.505
The only trouble is though, missy

641
01:11:00.672 --> 01:11:01.965
if you should

642
01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:04.801
lose the face...

643
01:11:05.010 --> 01:11:06.678
Please, don't hurt my baby.

644
01:11:06.845 --> 01:11:09.806
- ...you've got nothing!
- What do you want from me?

645
01:11:11.183 --> 01:11:14.019
- Don't change the subject.
- Hold it!

646
01:11:15.103 --> 01:11:17.856
- Right there!
- Aah!

647
01:11:18.023 --> 01:11:20.400
- I hate guns.
- Old lady.

648
01:11:20.984 --> 01:11:22.319
Stand back!

649
01:11:22.485 --> 01:11:24.279
- Stay back!
- Woman!

650
01:11:24.821 --> 01:11:26.573
Stay back!

651
01:11:33.997 --> 01:11:36.791
Anyone so much as breathes

652
01:11:36.958 --> 01:11:38.668
I'll cream them!

653
01:11:38.835 --> 01:11:41.129
Open that door.

654
01:11:41.504 --> 01:11:43.590
You get over there.

655
01:11:44.507 --> 01:11:47.302
Put the baby on the ground.

656
01:11:49.679 --> 01:11:51.306
Jessie!

657
01:11:51.473 --> 01:11:52.766
Get the van.

658
01:12:30.845 --> 01:12:34.349
- Gate!
- Don't stop. Just go right through.

659
01:12:58.540 --> 01:12:59.582
Now what?!

660
01:13:06.923 --> 01:13:09.259
- The motor!
- What are you trying to say?

661
01:13:09.426 --> 01:13:11.136
I don't know, it just died on me.

662
01:13:13.305 --> 01:13:15.598
No! Run!

663
01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:40.248
Oh.

664
01:14:02.645 --> 01:14:05.482
No, Jessie!

665
01:14:06.816 --> 01:14:08.735
Lord have mercy!

666
01:14:09.611 --> 01:14:12.030
Lord have mercy!

667
01:14:54.489 --> 01:14:55.698
What do you think?

668
01:14:55.865 --> 01:14:57.909
I'm a doctor, not a fortuneteller.

669
01:14:58.535 --> 01:14:59.661
This your subdural?

670
01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:02.163
- Yes, that's her.
- Lot of problems, huh?

671
01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:05.792
Multiple traumas, spleen,
liver, lung, flail chest

672
01:15:05.959 --> 01:15:08.670
left neck of femur, renal shutdown.

673
01:15:09.045 --> 01:15:11.256
Reads like a grocery list.
She salvageable?

674
01:15:11.423 --> 01:15:14.300
Yeah, sure, we got
all her signs back last night.

675
01:15:14.467 --> 01:15:16.219
- Relatives?
- The husband.

676
01:15:16.386 --> 01:15:18.388
They lost the kid. DOA.

677
01:15:18.972 --> 01:15:23.017
Listen, tell him she's going to
be all right. Tell him not to worry.

678
01:15:23.852 --> 01:15:25.603
If he wants, I'll talk to him.

679
01:15:25.770 --> 01:15:28.356
I don't think he wants to talk to anyone.

680
01:15:29.399 --> 01:15:32.193
He's been standing there
like a zombie all day.

681
01:16:34.631 --> 01:16:36.925
Bubba Zanetti, is that you?

682
01:16:37.634 --> 01:16:39.594
You come for the scooter?

683
01:16:40.261 --> 01:16:42.555
She won't be ready until this afternoon.

684
01:16:42.722 --> 01:16:45.141
Still having trouble with the front forks.

685
01:16:45.308 --> 01:16:47.644
They're mothers to work with.

686
01:16:48.686 --> 01:16:50.146
Hey!

687
01:16:50.355 --> 01:16:53.232
You asshole! What the molly frock
do you think you're doing?

688
01:16:53.316 --> 01:16:56.945
You and me are gonna talk
about the Toecutter.

689
01:16:57.445 --> 01:16:59.781
Never heard of him. Aah!

690
01:16:59.948 --> 01:17:01.658
What the Christ?

691
01:17:01.866 --> 01:17:03.785
I want to know about the Toecutter.

692
01:17:03.952 --> 01:17:05.703
I mind my own business, don't I?

693
01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:07.872
I mean, they'd kill me if I didn't.

694
01:17:22.845 --> 01:17:26.599
I'll say the names and
you say "yes" or "no."

695
01:17:28.017 --> 01:17:29.894
- Nightrider.
- Yeah.

696
01:17:30.061 --> 01:17:32.230
- The Toecutter.
- Yeah.

697
01:17:32.397 --> 01:17:34.190
- Bubba Zanetti.
- Yes!

698
01:17:34.357 --> 01:17:35.441
There's more?

699
01:17:35.608 --> 01:17:37.527
- They took Johnny.
- Johnny the Boy?

700
01:17:37.694 --> 01:17:39.988
- Yeah. Some others.
- Where?

701
01:17:41.322 --> 01:17:43.408
Out at the beaches, looking for fuel.

702
01:17:43.575 --> 01:17:44.993
Are they coming back?

703
01:17:45.159 --> 01:17:46.995
I don't know.

704
01:17:47.537 --> 01:17:49.080
They got their bikes.

705
01:17:50.081 --> 01:17:52.083
I don't know anymore.

706
01:22:15.054 --> 01:22:17.306
<i>Locate black Pursuit Special.</i>

707
01:22:17.473 --> 01:22:20.184
<i>Unauthorized use by a Main Force officer.</i>

708
01:23:16.198 --> 01:23:18.200
Quit toying, Bubba.

709
01:23:18.367 --> 01:23:21.287
Easy. I know what I'm doing.

710
01:27:45.634 --> 01:27:46.677
Hi.

711
01:27:47.553 --> 01:27:49.346
Hey, man. This...

712
01:27:49.555 --> 01:27:51.515
This isn't what it looks, man.

713
01:27:51.682 --> 01:27:55.477
You know, I... I just came down here
to check it out, and

714
01:27:55.686 --> 01:27:58.022
this guy has already been snuffed.

715
01:27:58.230 --> 01:28:00.274
Nothing you could do for him.

716
01:28:01.775 --> 01:28:03.277
Ankle.

717
01:28:04.778 --> 01:28:06.113
It's okay.

718
01:28:10.409 --> 01:28:12.411
What are you doing, man?

719
01:28:20.294 --> 01:28:22.004
Careful, my ankle! My foot, man!

720
01:28:22.671 --> 01:28:26.383
Hey, listen, I had nothing to do
with anything going on back there, man.

721
01:28:27.551 --> 01:28:30.429
Hey, listen, man, will you?
Listen to me!

722
01:28:30.638 --> 01:28:34.057
Will you listen to me? They were
a hell of a crazy people back there, man.

723
01:28:34.141 --> 01:28:38.437
Some kind of bad people.
I'm not responsible for anything.

724
01:28:40.648 --> 01:28:42.107
Ow. What are you doing?

725
01:28:42.274 --> 01:28:43.901
What are you doing, man?

726
01:28:46.237 --> 01:28:49.073
What do you say?
What are you doing?

727
01:28:49.949 --> 01:28:52.952
Hey, listen, I'm not a bad man.

728
01:28:53.118 --> 01:28:55.621
I'm sick, see? Sick.

729
01:28:56.455 --> 01:28:58.082
What do you call it?

730
01:28:58.249 --> 01:29:00.918
Psychopathic, you know.
Personality disorder.

731
01:29:01.126 --> 01:29:03.462
The judge, man, he said so.

732
01:29:04.129 --> 01:29:05.829
You're not gonna hurt me, are you?

733
01:29:09.009 --> 01:29:12.221
Jesus! You can't kill me!

734
01:29:12.388 --> 01:29:14.598
Not for stealing a man's boots!

735
01:29:16.183 --> 01:29:18.978
He was dead, for Christ sakes!

736
01:29:20.479 --> 01:29:22.731
He won't need them anymore!

737
01:29:24.066 --> 01:29:25.985
What are you doing?

738
01:29:27.194 --> 01:29:30.322
I wanna know what you're doing.

739
01:29:36.036 --> 01:29:39.665
The chain in those handcuffs
is high-tensile steel.

740
01:29:41.292 --> 01:29:44.420
It'd take you 10 minutes
to hack through it with this.

741
01:29:47.047 --> 01:29:49.341
Now, if you're lucky

742
01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:52.761
you could hack through your ankle
in five minutes.

743
01:29:55.180 --> 01:29:57.099
You're mad, man!

744
01:29:57.474 --> 01:30:00.185
You think I look silly, don't you?

745
01:30:01.937 --> 01:30:03.981
Don't bring this on me, man.

746
01:30:04.148 --> 01:30:05.941
Don't do this to me!

747
01:30:06.108 --> 01:30:09.153
Please, sweet Jesus. I was sick!

748
01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:11.947
Don't bring this on me, please!
