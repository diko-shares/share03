00:01:08.015 --> 00:01:10.406
<i>Since the beginning of time,</i>

3
00:01:11.226 --> 00:01:14.841
<i>since the first little
girl ever existed,</i>

4
00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:18.968
<i>there have been dolls.</i>

5
00:01:20.685 --> 00:01:25.195
<i>But the dolls were always
and forever baby dolls.</i>

6
00:01:26.656 --> 00:01:28.154
<i>The girls who played with them</i>

7
00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:31.292
<i>could only ever play
at being mothers.</i>

8
00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:36.242
<i>Which can be fun, at
least for a while, anyway.</i>

9
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.039
<i>Ask your mother.</i>

10
00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:43.890
<i>This continued until...</i>

11
00:02:50.546 --> 00:02:54.073
<i>Yes, Barbie changed everything.</i>

12
00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:57.043
<i>Then, she changed it all again.</i>

13
00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:59.178
<i>All of these women are Barbie,</i>

14
00:02:59.213 --> 00:03:02.583
<i>and Barbie is all
of these women.</i>

15
00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:06.018
<i>She might have started out as
just a lady in a bathing suit,</i>

16
00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:08.988
<i>but she became so much more.</i>

17
00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:11.592
<i>She has her own
money, her own house,</i>

18
00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:15.429
<i>her own car, her own career.</i>

19
00:03:15.462 --> 00:03:20.367
<i>Because Barbie can be anything,
women can be anything.</i>

20
00:03:20.401 --> 00:03:22.669
<i>And this has been reflected back</i>

21
00:03:22.703 --> 00:03:26.707
<i>onto the little girls of
today in the Real World.</i>

22
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.675
<i>Girls can grow into women,</i>

23
00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.377
<i>who can achieve everything</i>

24
00:03:30.411 --> 00:03:32.679
<i>and anything they
set their mind to.</i>

25
00:03:32.713 --> 00:03:35.081
<i>Thanks to Barbie,</i>

26
00:03:35.114 --> 00:03:41.087
<i>all problems of feminism and
equal rights have been solved.</i>

27

- You're the voice of a generation.
- I know.

107
00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:12.265
In our assessment,
money is not speech,

108
00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:15.235
and corporations have no free
speech rights to begin with.

109
00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:17.638
So any claim on their part
to be exercising a right

110
00:07:17.671 --> 00:07:21.408
is just their attempt to turn
our democracy into a plutocracy.

111
00:07:22.786 --> 00:07:24.745
This makes me emotional,
and I'm expressing it.

00:10:04.738 --> 00:10:05.872
Okay?

175
00:10:05.906 --> 00:10:06.973
Let's go.

176
00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:09.686
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

177
00:10:09.711 --> 00:10:11.312
- You did so well.
- You still hurt?

178
00:10:11.337 --> 00:10:12.638
We'll get you fixed up.

179
00:10:19.686 --> 00:10:20.821
- Go!
- Go!

180
00:10:22.556 --> 00:10:24.991
- Barbie, hold my hand!
- You're okay.

181
00:10:25.025 --> 00:10:26.493
Stay with me, Barbie!

182
00:10:28.198 --> 00:10:29.396
Great.

183
00:10:29.429 --> 00:10:31.491
Not even broken.
You'll be fine.

184
00:10:31.516 --> 00:10:33.985
Shredding waves is much more
dangerous than people realize.

185
00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:35.073
You're very brave, Ken.

186
00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:38.572
- Thank you, Barbie.
- Yeah.

187
00:10:38.605 --> 00:10:40.884
- You know surfer is not even my job.
- I know.

188
00:10:40.909 --> 00:10:43.912
And it is not lifeguard, which
is a common misconception.

189
00:10:43.937 --> 00:10:46.503
- Very common.
- Because actually my job...

190
00:10:47.703 --> 00:10:49.939
- it's just beach.
- Right.

191
00:10:49.964 --> 00:10:51.801
And what a good job
you do at beach.

192
00:10:51.826 --> 00:10:53.194
You should heal up in no time.

193
00:10:53.219 --> 00:10:54.664
Actually, in the time
that it took for me

194
00:10:54.688 --> 00:10:56.366
to say that
sentence, you healed.

195
00:10:56.391 --> 00:10:57.824
- Fantastic.
- Nice.

196
00:10:57.858 --> 00:10:59.228
- Hey, Barbie.
- Yeah?

197
00:10:59.253 --> 00:11:00.703
Can I come to your
house tonight?

198
00:11:00.728 --> 00:11:02.738
- Sure. I don't have anything big planned.
- Yes.

199
00:11:02.762 --> 00:11:04.440
Just a giant blowout
party with all the Barbies

200
00:11:04.464 --> 00:11:05.942
and planned choreography
and a bespoke song.

201
00:11:05.966 --> 00:11:07.735
You should stop by.

202
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.128
- So cool.
- Yeah.

203
00:11:09.153 --> 00:11:11.223

- I'm so embarrassed.

345
00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:51.070
- Barbie doesn't get embarrassed.
- I know.

346
00:17:51.104 --> 00:17:53.172
Barbie, I don't even
have context for this,

347
00:17:53.207 --> 00:17:57.043
but my feet... my heels
are on the ground.

348
00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:58.911
I'm no longer on tiptoes.

349
00:17:58.945 --> 00:18:00.314
That's okay. Let me see.

350
00:18:03.517 --> 00:18:06.986
Flat feet!

351
00:18:11.592 --> 00:18:13.026
Oh, no!

352
00:18:15.429 --> 00:18:16.863
Stop it, Ken.

353
00:18:16.896 --> 00:18:18.499
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

354
00:18:18.532 --> 00:18:20.066
I know I'm Stereotypical Barbie

355
00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:21.602
and therefore don't
form conjectures

356
00:18:21.635 --> 00:18:24.003
concerning the causality of
adjacent unfolding events,

357
00:18:24.037 --> 00:18:26.318
but some things have been
happening that might be related.

358
00:18:28.442 --> 00:18:30.277
Bad breath this
morning, a cold shower,

359
00:18:30.311 --> 00:18:31.878
burnt waffle, and
falling off my roof.

360
00:18:31.911 --> 00:18:33.179
You're malfunctioning.

361
00:18:33.213 --> 00:18:35.316
What? No, I'm just, I'm...

362
00:18:35.349 --> 00:18:37.618
Am I?

363
00:18:37.651 --> 00:18:40.297
I've never seen this kind of malfunction
before. It's usually just hair-related.

364
00:18:40.321 --> 00:18:43.189
You know, you're gonna
have to visit Weird Barbie.

365
00:18:43.223 --> 00:18:45.592
I have never had to
visit Weird Barbie.

366
00:18:45.626 --> 00:18:47.594
That's because you've
never malfunctioned.

367
00:18:47.628 --> 00:18:50.897
I heard that she used to be the
most beautiful Barbie of all,

368
00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:54.133
but then someone played with
her too hard in the Real World.

369
00:18:54.167 --> 00:18:56.279
<i>- ♪ Colors of the world ♪</i>

376
00:19:05.824 --> 00:19:08.358
And now she's fated to an eternity
of making other Barbies perfect

377
00:19:08.382 --> 00:19:11.452
while falling more and more
into disrepair herself.

378
00:19:11.485 --> 00:19:13.052
That, and we all
call her Weird Barbie

379
00:19:13.086 --> 00:19:15.389
both behind her back
and also to her face.

380
00:19:15.422 --> 00:19:16.956
She's so weird.

381
00:19:18.383 --> 00:19:20.552
Why is she always in the splits?

382
00:19:20.577 --> 00:19:25.374

383
00:19:27.791 --> 00:19:31.829
I would never wear heels if
my feet were shaped this way.

384

Hey.

What's cookin', good-lookin'?

392
00:19:49.533 --> 00:19:51.300
- Hi.
- Welcome.

393
00:19:51.325 --> 00:19:53.221
Welcome to my Weirdhouse.

394
00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:59.273
- Hi, how are ya?
- Nice to meet you.

395
00:19:59.298 --> 00:20:01.535
Sorry about the dog crap.
What can I do ya for?

396
00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.830
I just had to come
see you about my feet.

397
00:20:04.855 --> 00:20:06.288
They're, um...

398
00:20:12.346 --> 00:20:14.838
- Flat.
- Yeah.

399
00:20:14.863 --> 00:20:16.512
Never seen that before.

400
00:20:16.537 --> 00:20:17.971
- Really?
- Whoa.

401
00:20:17.996 --> 00:20:21.083
Okay. Well, can you,
you know, fix them?

402
00:20:21.108 --> 00:20:22.542
You're Stereotypical
Barbie, right?

403
00:20:22.567 --> 00:20:23.918
Mmm-hmm.

404
00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:28.914
That Ken of yours, he is one
nice-looking little protein pot.

405
00:20:28.939 --> 00:20:29.945
I guess.

406
00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:33.336
I'd like to see what kind of nude
blob he's packing under those jeans.

407
00:20:34.015 --> 00:20:36.664
- Anyway, what preceded this?
- Oh, nothing.

408
00:20:36.726 --> 00:20:40.249
A really fun game of volleyball.

409
00:20:40.274 --> 00:20:43.142
- That's it?
- Thoughts of death.

410
00:20:43.418 --> 00:20:44.385
What is it?

411
00:20:46.198 --> 00:20:48.908
Maybe some thoughts of death?

412
00:20:48.933 --> 00:20:50.451
Thoughts of death!

413
00:20:50.484 --> 00:20:52.779
- Is that a problem?
- Oh.

414
00:20:52.804 --> 00:20:54.606
- What?
- I've heard of this.

415
00:20:54.631 --> 00:20:57.534
Of course, I didn't think it
was possible, but it's real.

416
00:20:59.226 --> 00:21:01.923
Oh, you've done it.
You've opened a portal.

417
00:21:01.948 --> 00:21:03.597
I didn't open a portal.

418
00:21:03.622 --> 00:21:07.334
Someone did. And now, there
is a rip in the continuum

419
00:21:07.367 --> 00:21:10.555
that is the membrane between
Barbie Land and the Real World,

420
00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:12.790
and if you wanna be Stereotypical
Barbie perfect again,

421
00:21:12.815 --> 00:21:14.751
then, baby girl,
you gotta go fix it.

422
00:21:14.776 --> 00:21:18.445
Or you're gonna keep going
funny. Look at your upper thigh.

423
00:21:18.479 --> 00:21:20.876
- What is that?
- That's cellulite.

424
00:21:20.901 --> 00:21:22.583
- That's gonna spread everywhere.
- What?

425
00:21:22.616 --> 00:21:25.767
And then you're gonna start getting
sad and mushy and complicated.

426
00:21:25.792 --> 00:21:27.053
No!

427
00:21:27.086 --> 00:21:28.572
What do I have to do?

428
00:21:28.597 --> 00:21:30.189
You have to go

429
00:21:30.224 --> 00:21:31.792
- to the Real World.
- Okay.

430
00:21:31.825 --> 00:21:34.212
And you have to find the
girl who's playing with you.

431
00:21:34.237 --> 00:21:35.329
Playing with me?

432
00:21:35.362 --> 00:21:36.620
We're all being
played with, babe.

433
00:21:36.645 --> 00:21:39.169
But usually there's some
kind of separation. Thanks.

434
00:21:39.198 --> 00:21:43.111
There's the girl and the doll.
And never the twain shall cross.

435
00:21:43.136 --> 00:21:44.471
- The twain is crossing?
- Yes.

436
00:21:44.505 --> 00:21:46.607
And the girl who's playing
with you, she must be sad,

437
00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.064
and her thoughts and
feelings and humanness

438
00:21:49.089 --> 00:21:51.158
are interfering
with your dollness.

439
00:21:51.183 --> 00:21:52.728
Why would she be sad?

440
00:21:52.753 --> 00:21:55.533
We fixed everything so that
all women in the Real World

441
00:21:55.558 --> 00:21:57.165
can be happy and powerful.

442
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:58.552
I don't know, but if you ask me,

443
00:21:58.585 --> 00:22:00.487
- you had something to do with this, too.
- Me?

444
00:22:00.521 --> 00:22:02.603
- Takes two to rip a portal.
- I can't have.

445
00:22:02.628 --> 00:22:03.949
I've only ever wanted

446
00:22:04.019 --> 00:22:05.767
for everything to
stay exactly as it is.

447
00:22:05.792 --> 00:22:07.144
Well, be that as it may,

448
00:22:07.169 --> 00:22:10.678
the two of you are becoming
inextricably intertwined.

449
00:22:10.703 --> 00:22:12.948
And you gotta help
her to help yourself.

450
00:22:18.788 --> 00:22:20.056
So, should... Whoo!

451
00:22:20.081 --> 00:22:21.845
So, what'll it be then?

452
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:23.251
You can go back to
your regular life

453
00:22:23.276 --> 00:22:24.832
and forget any of
this ever happened,

454
00:22:24.857 --> 00:22:27.760
or you can know the
truth about the universe.

455
00:22:28.889 --> 00:22:32.159
The choice is now yours.

456
00:22:32.184 --> 00:22:33.986
The first one. The high heel.

457
00:22:34.011 --> 00:22:36.690
No. We'll do a re-do.

458
00:22:36.723 --> 00:22:38.314
You're supposed to want to know.

459
00:22:38.339 --> 00:22:39.293
I don't.

460
00:22:39.326 --> 00:22:40.727
Mmm. Babe, listen.

461
00:22:40.761 --> 00:22:42.798
You have to want to
know, okay? Do it again.

462
00:22:42.823 --> 00:22:45.075
I'm not Adventure Barbie.
I'm Stereotypical Barbie.

463
00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.602
I'm like the Barbie you think of

464
00:22:46.627 --> 00:22:48.886
when someone says,
"Think of a Barbie."

465
00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:50.089
That's me.

466
00:22:50.537 --> 00:22:53.853
I'm bummed. You're a
bummer. That's a bummer.

467
00:22:53.878 --> 00:22:55.837
Okay, I'm ready to forget now.

468
00:22:55.862 --> 00:22:58.353
No! You're doing this one!

469
00:22:58.378 --> 00:23:01.103
I just gave you a choice so you
could feel some sense of control.

470
00:23:01.128 --> 00:23:03.126
- So there is no option one?
- No!

471
00:23:03.151 --> 00:23:06.185
You have to fix
the rip yourself.

472
00:23:06.219 --> 00:23:08.384
Don't blame me, blame
Mattel. They make the rules.

473
00:23:08.409 --> 00:23:10.242
Oh, I don't want to.

474
00:23:10.267 --> 00:23:11.937
Fine, get cellulite.
I don't care.

475
00:23:11.962 --> 00:23:14.164
No! No, no, no.
No. Okay. Yeah.

476
00:23:17.163 --> 00:23:19.666
Send me through the portal.

477
00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.452
Okay. There's
actually no portal.

478
00:23:21.477 --> 00:23:22.845
- Oh.
- It's a figure of speech.

479
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:25.783
It's actually a sports
car to a speedboat,

480
00:23:25.808 --> 00:23:28.415
to a rocket ship,
to a tandem bike,

481
00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.019
to a camper van, fun,
to a snowmobile, brr,

482
00:23:31.044 --> 00:23:32.579
which will take
you most of the way

483
00:23:32.604 --> 00:23:34.072
to the state of Los Angeles,

484
00:23:34.097 --> 00:23:36.056
where you will don
neon and Rollerblades,

485
00:23:36.081 --> 00:23:38.352
and enter the country
of California.

486
00:23:38.385 --> 00:23:40.783
Weird, I know. Best if you
don't think about it too much.

487
00:23:40.808 --> 00:23:43.510
And then when I get there,
how do I find this girl?

488
00:23:44.257 --> 00:23:46.226
You will know.

489
00:23:46.259 --> 00:23:48.728
Okay. And how do I get back?

490
00:23:48.753 --> 00:23:50.642
The same way you
came, but in reverse.

491
00:23:50.667 --> 00:23:53.540
Like I should move forward but
do the order backward or go...

492
00:23:53.565 --> 00:23:55.447
- Don't overthink it.
- Oh. Okay.

493
00:23:55.472 --> 00:23:59.736
For you see, if you do not
find her and fix things,

494
00:23:59.761 --> 00:24:01.475
what's ugly will become uglier,

495
00:24:01.508 --> 00:24:03.410
and what's weird
will become weirder.

496
00:24:03.755 --> 00:24:05.624
And then you'll look like me.

497
00:24:05.649 --> 00:24:06.769
Ahh! Oh.

498
00:24:07.581 --> 00:24:09.073
Sorry.

499
00:24:09.449 --> 00:24:12.189
I understand. I set
myself up for that.

500
00:24:12.214 --> 00:24:14.455
- Anyway, I believe in you.
- Thank you.

501
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.757
Go. Be careful. I love you.

502
00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:18.859
- Bye.
- Bye.

503
00:24:18.892 --> 00:24:21.193
Bon voyage to reality,

504
00:24:21.228 --> 00:24:24.158
and good luck
restoring the membrane

505
00:24:24.183 --> 00:24:26.958
that separates our
world from theirs

506
00:24:26.983 --> 00:24:29.052
so you don't get cellulite!

507
00:24:30.971 --> 00:24:33.775
- I guess she's going without you.
- You're so lost, Ken.

508
00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.909
She literally asked me.

509
00:24:35.942 --> 00:24:38.278
And I was like, "I
prefer to stay here."

510
00:24:38.311 --> 00:24:39.697
Why? Are you scared?

511
00:24:39.722 --> 00:24:41.837
- No.
- I bet you're scared.

512
00:24:41.862 --> 00:24:44.426
And I bet she doesn't
even want you to go.

513
00:24:44.451 --> 00:24:46.212
Well, you bet both those
things incorrectly,

514
00:24:46.237 --> 00:24:48.010
and I bet in the
opposite direction.

515
00:24:48.035 --> 00:24:49.503
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

516
00:24:49.528 --> 00:24:51.034
Which way is that?

517
00:24:51.358 --> 00:24:52.815
You don't even know.

518
00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.806
I just don't want to leave. I'm
trying to find reasons not to leave.

519
00:24:55.831 --> 00:24:56.797
Please stay.

520
00:24:56.822 --> 00:24:58.472
I'm gonna miss you guys so much.

521
00:24:58.497 --> 00:25:00.710
I just wish someone could
come with me, but you can't.

522
00:25:00.734 --> 00:25:01.935
I should do this alone.

523
00:25:01.968 --> 00:25:03.894
- What bird am I thinking of?
- Parrot.

524
00:25:03.919 --> 00:25:05.651
Dolphin. I mean, no, a bird.

525
00:25:06.083 --> 00:25:07.017
Pelican.

526
00:25:07.042 --> 00:25:08.550
- Ohh.
- Man.

527
00:25:08.575 --> 00:25:10.183
We'll miss you, Barbie.

528
00:25:10.208 --> 00:25:11.820
I'll be back in no
time, with perfect feet,

529
00:25:11.845 --> 00:25:13.636
and we'll forget that
this ever happened.

530
00:25:13.661 --> 00:25:15.892
And you'll get to see all the good
work we've done to fix the world.

531
00:25:15.917 --> 00:25:17.626
You'll be such a hero to them.

532
00:25:17.651 --> 00:25:19.519
All those grateful,
powerful women

533
00:25:19.553 --> 00:25:22.082
who owe their wonderful
lives to Barbie.

534
00:25:22.107 --> 00:25:24.175
I'll bet every woman
will say thank you

535
00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.935
and give you a really big hug.

536
00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:29.404
Yes, you're right. Here I go.

537
00:25:29.429 --> 00:25:31.086
- Bye.
- Yay!

538
00:25:31.111 --> 00:25:33.546
- Bye, Barbie.
- Bye.

539
00:25:34.668 --> 00:25:37.267
Bye, Barbie. Good
luck in reality.

540
00:25:37.292 --> 00:25:39.503
Watch for cellulite!

I'm coming with you.

550
00:26:17.745 --> 00:26:19.908
- No. Please get out.
- I can't.

551
00:26:19.933 --> 00:26:21.405
I made a double bet with Ken,

552
00:26:21.448 --> 00:26:24.550
and you can't make me look
uncool in front of Ken.

553
00:26:24.575 --> 00:26:26.080
Ken's not cool!

554
00:26:26.105 --> 00:26:27.251
He is to me.

555
00:26:27.276 --> 00:26:28.815
You're just gonna slow me down.

556
00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.908
Barbie, what if there's beach?

557
00:26:30.933 --> 00:26:33.151
You'll need someone who's
a professional in that.

558
00:26:35.206 --> 00:26:37.575
Did you bring your Rollerblades?

559
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.268
I literally go
nowhere without them.

560
00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.025
- Please?
- Okay.

561
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:44.404
Wow.

562
00:26:44.437 --> 00:26:46.006
Let's do this.

563
00:26:46.109 --> 00:26:47.544
- Can I sit in the front?
- No.

564
00:26:49.009 --> 00:26:51.538

565
00:26:51.563 --> 00:26:54.199

Yes!

576
00:27:39.092 --> 00:27:41.461
Wow. This is the Real World.

577
00:27:41.494 --> 00:27:44.132
Barbie, I told you
there'd be beach.

578
00:27:44.157 --> 00:27:45.025
Yeah.

579
00:27:51.758 --> 00:27:52.792
Hmm.

580
00:27:52.817 --> 00:27:54.839
Oh, yeah!

581
00:27:57.024 --> 00:27:58.401
What's going on?

582
00:27:58.425 --> 00:28:00.394
Give us a smile, blondie.

583
00:28:01.615 --> 00:28:03.049
Why are these men looking at me?

584
00:28:03.083 --> 00:28:04.784
Yeah, they're also
staring at me.

585
00:28:04.872 --> 00:28:06.665
Ooh, love that!

586
00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:07.721
Wow!

587
00:28:07.754 --> 00:28:10.657
I feel kind of ill
at ease. Like...

588
00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:12.168
I don't know the word
for it, but I'm...

589
00:28:12.198 --> 00:28:13.573
Nice leotard.

590
00:28:13.598 --> 00:28:17.408
Conscious, but it's myself
that I'm conscious of.

591
00:28:17.433 --> 00:28:18.598
I'm not getting any of that.

592
00:28:18.632 --> 00:28:21.126
I feel what could only
be described as admired.

593
00:28:21.262 --> 00:28:22.947
- Damn, girl!
- But not ogled.

594
00:28:22.972 --> 00:28:24.070
You're hot.

595
00:28:24.104 --> 00:28:25.837
And there's no
undertone of violence.

596
00:28:25.862 --> 00:28:28.608
Mine very much has an
undertone of violence.

597
00:28:28.642 --> 00:28:30.591
Oh, look, a construction site.

598
00:28:30.616 --> 00:28:32.517
We need that good
feminine energy.

599
00:28:32.542 --> 00:28:34.822
- Yeah.
- Ladies! Yoo-hoo.

600
00:28:34.847 --> 00:28:36.549
- Oh.
- You got fries with that shake?

601
00:28:36.583 --> 00:28:38.527
If I said you had a hot body,
would you hold it against me?

602
00:28:38.551 --> 00:28:39.829
Have I died and gone to heaven?

603
00:28:39.853 --> 00:28:41.534
Is that a mirror in your pocket?

604
00:28:41.559 --> 00:28:42.909
- Baby, you are an angel.
- I can see myself in your shorts.

605
00:28:42.934 --> 00:28:45.601
I don't know exactly what you meant
with all of those little quips,

606
00:28:45.625 --> 00:28:47.560
but I'm picking up on
some sort of entendre,

607
00:28:47.594 --> 00:28:49.408
which appears to be double,

608
00:28:49.433 --> 00:28:51.134
and I would just
like to inform you,

609
00:28:51.159 --> 00:28:54.075
I do not have a vagina.

610
00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:56.169
And he does not have a penis.

611
00:28:56.466 --> 00:28:58.267
We don't have genitals.

612
00:28:58.292 --> 00:28:59.472
- That's okay.
- Yeah.

613
00:28:59.506 --> 00:29:01.376
- Yeah, whatever. Yeah.
- It's cool.

614
00:29:01.401 --> 00:29:03.743
I have all the genitals.

615
00:29:03.777 --> 00:29:06.079
Geez, you would think a
construction site at lunch time

616
00:29:06.112 --> 00:29:08.790
would be the perfect place
for a little woman power,

617
00:29:08.815 --> 00:29:12.552
but this one was so... male.

618
00:29:12.585 --> 00:29:16.656
Everything is almost
like... reversed here.

619
00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:20.354
Oh, look!

620
00:29:20.379 --> 00:29:21.513
The Supreme Court.

621
00:29:21.538 --> 00:29:23.306
- They're so smart.
- Yeah.

622
00:29:23.331 --> 00:29:25.732
Yeah, bruh! Do it, bro!

623
00:29:30.495 --> 00:29:32.464
I love me a leotard.

624
00:29:32.489 --> 00:29:34.157
I love the elbow pads.

625
00:29:34.182 --> 00:29:36.218
I think we should get
some different clothes.

626
00:29:38.144 --> 00:29:39.746
We look great.

627
00:29:39.779 --> 00:29:41.374
- I love fringe.
- I love denim.

628
00:29:41.399 --> 00:29:42.766
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

629
00:29:43.183 --> 00:29:44.617
Hey, man.

630
00:29:44.838 --> 00:29:46.973
You guys gotta pay
for that stuff.

631
00:29:49.689 --> 00:29:51.100
She looks even better
in more clothes.

632
00:29:51.124 --> 00:29:52.792
Because you can imagine more.

633
00:29:52.817 --> 00:29:55.296
You know what? Keep 'em.

634
00:29:55.329 --> 00:29:57.831
Weird Barbie said I would
know how to find this girl,

635
00:29:57.864 --> 00:29:59.766
but I have no idea.

636
00:29:59.799 --> 00:30:00.834
Hmm.

637
00:30:00.867 --> 00:30:02.802
What would a smart Barbie do?

638
00:30:02.836 --> 00:30:05.071
I just need to clear
my mind so I can think.

639
00:30:05.105 --> 00:30:07.140
Who is playing with me?

640
00:30:07.173 --> 00:30:09.142
I hate it when people
think. I get so bored.

641
00:30:09.175 --> 00:30:11.962
Faster I figure it out, the
faster we get to go home.

642
00:30:11.987 --> 00:30:13.813
- What am I supposed to do?
- Ken!

643
00:30:13.847 --> 00:30:15.325
- Go for a walk or something.
- By myself?

644
00:30:15.349 --> 00:30:16.950
- Yes.
- Really? Where?

645
00:30:16.983 --> 00:30:18.184
Anywhere.

646
00:30:18.219 --> 00:30:20.683
- Can I go that way?
- Yes. Okay.

647
00:30:25.859 --> 00:30:27.714
- Don't go far.
- Okay!

648
00:30:32.157 --> 00:30:33.448
Excuse me, sir.

649
00:30:34.227 --> 00:30:35.862
Thanks, man.

650
00:30:46.079 --> 00:30:47.947
What's up, man?

651
00:30:47.981 --> 00:30:49.658
- We've got to man up on this one.
- Great workout, man.

652
00:30:49.682 --> 00:30:50.984
Men, men, men.

653
00:30:51.017 --> 00:30:53.586
- You're the man!
- No, <i>you're</i> the man!

654
00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:55.815
Men, men, men!

655
00:31:04.964 --> 00:31:07.834
Based on the ROI, we are
exceeding expectations.

656
00:31:07.867 --> 00:31:09.912
- Good stuff. So I'm not worried about it.
- Excuse me...

657
00:31:09.936 --> 00:31:12.005
Not now, Margaret.
Let's shake on this.

658
00:31:12.038 --> 00:31:14.638
- We are gonna make a lot of money.
- We are officially important.

659
00:31:36.655 --> 00:31:37.922
Yes!

660
00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.028
That felt...

661
00:32:48.276 --> 00:32:50.526
achy, but good.

662
00:32:59.286 --> 00:33:01.230
I'm actually trying
to make this work.

663
00:33:01.255 --> 00:33:02.600
How? By calling me a lunatic?

664
00:33:02.625 --> 00:33:04.327
That's not how you
make things work.

665
00:33:04.352 --> 00:33:05.632
I don't know what this is all...

666
00:33:45.494 --> 00:33:46.987
You're so beautiful.

667
00:33:48.444 --> 00:33:49.698
I know it.

668
00:33:56.503 --> 00:33:58.905
Barbie! Barbie!

669
00:33:58.938 --> 00:34:00.006
Yes!

670
00:34:00.039 --> 00:34:01.095
I've got it!

671
00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.075
Oh, what do you got?

672
00:34:02.108 --> 00:34:03.386
- You go first.
- No, no, you go.

673
00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:05.178
- We'll go at the same time.
- Okay.

674
00:34:05.212 --> 00:34:07.046
- She's at school.
- Men rule the world!

675
00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.915
- What was that?
- The kid's at the school?

676
00:34:08.948 --> 00:34:10.235
But what did you say?

677
00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:11.595
- Nothing.
- Okay.

678
00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:13.454
- Well, let's go to the school.
- Okay!

679
00:34:13.479 --> 00:34:14.753
Now, come on.

680
00:34:32.406 --> 00:34:34.673
- Hello.
- This is Dan of the FBI.

681
00:34:34.698 --> 00:34:36.142
Oh. This is Aaron at Mattel.

682
00:34:36.175 --> 00:34:37.820
I don't give a flying
squirrel who you are, Aaron.

683
00:34:37.844 --> 00:34:39.556
- What are you, like an intern?
- No, I'm...

684
00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:41.509
Two of your dolls
have gotten loose.

685
00:34:41.534 --> 00:34:42.549
Impossible.

686
00:34:42.583 --> 00:34:44.223
- How do you know?
- Don't sass me, Aaron.

687
00:34:44.251 --> 00:34:46.392
Couple of blondes,
answering to Barbie and Ken.

688
00:34:46.417 --> 00:34:48.033
Rollerblading in Santa Monica.

689
00:34:48.058 --> 00:34:49.922
<i>We're gonna need Mattel's
help landing the eagle.</i>

690
00:34:49.956 --> 00:34:51.543
<i>Don't crap the bed, Aaron!</i>

691
00:34:51.568 --> 00:34:52.536
I won't.

692
00:34:55.028 --> 00:34:57.030
This is bad. This
is really bad.

693
00:34:57.063 --> 00:34:58.998
- What?
- This happened before.

694
00:34:59.032 --> 00:35:00.534
What? When?

695
00:35:00.559 --> 00:35:02.843
I heard about ten years
ago, a woman named Skipper

696
00:35:02.868 --> 00:35:04.736
turned up at some
family's home in Key West.

697
00:35:04.761 --> 00:35:06.407
Asked to babysit the kids.

698
00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.083
She then tried to take
their toddler surfing.

699
00:35:08.107 --> 00:35:09.394
- Geez.
- I know.

700
00:35:09.419 --> 00:35:10.853
They were able to straighten
it out, keep it under wraps,

701
00:35:10.877 --> 00:35:13.913
but this is serious.

702
00:35:13.946 --> 00:35:16.025
- I'm going all the way up.
- No one goes all the way up.

703
00:35:16.049 --> 00:35:18.394
- I have to.
- You may never come back.

704
00:35:19.715 --> 00:35:20.716
I know.

705
00:35:30.497 --> 00:35:33.964
♪ Closer I am to fine

706
00:35:33.998 --> 00:35:36.368
Oh.

707
00:35:36.503 --> 00:35:38.339
- Hey.
- Oh, hi, Aaron.

708
00:35:38.372 --> 00:35:39.939
- New drawings?
- Yeah.

709
00:35:39.972 --> 00:35:42.609
I just started drawing
these weird designs.

710
00:35:42.643 --> 00:35:44.177
These are different.

711
00:35:44.211 --> 00:35:47.013
It's Irrepressible
Thoughts of Death Barbie.

712
00:35:47.046 --> 00:35:49.115
Full Body Cellulite Barbie.

713
00:35:49.148 --> 00:35:51.218
Crippling Shame Barbie.

714
00:35:51.251 --> 00:35:54.453
Okay. Listen, I have to
speak to the top brass.

715
00:35:54.478 --> 00:35:55.580
- No.
- I must.

716
00:35:55.605 --> 00:35:57.120
- No.
- I'm going to.

717
00:35:57.168 --> 00:35:59.779
Aaron, they're in a big corporate
idea sesh. No one is to be admitted.

718
00:35:59.804 --> 00:36:02.104
- Aaron! Aaron! Aaron, stop!
- Always be empowering girls.

719
00:36:02.128 --> 00:36:03.370
Always!

720
00:36:03.395 --> 00:36:05.375
But what do we really
sell? I'll tell you what.

721
00:36:05.399 --> 00:36:07.211
- We sell dreams.
- Aaron.

722
00:36:07.236 --> 00:36:08.505
And imagination!

723
00:36:09.503 --> 00:36:11.338
And sparkle!

724
00:36:11.372 --> 00:36:13.407
I get excited. I'm passionate.

725
00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:16.325
And when you think of sparkle,
what do you think of after that?

726
00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:17.551
Female agency.

727
00:36:18.891 --> 00:36:20.481
Excuse me.

728
00:36:20.514 --> 00:36:22.915
- Who are you?
- Aaron Dinkins, sir.

729
00:36:22.949 --> 00:36:25.199
We're in the middle of a major
sit-down here, Aaron Dinkins.

730
00:36:25.224 --> 00:36:26.803
I think you're gonna
want to hear this, sir.

731
00:36:26.828 --> 00:36:29.638
Can you just e-mail it? And
you can send it to me EOD.

732
00:36:29.663 --> 00:36:30.764
End of day.

733
00:36:30.789 --> 00:36:32.493
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

734
00:36:32.526 --> 00:36:35.995
May I put it in a whisper, sir?

735
00:36:36.106 --> 00:36:37.461
Fine. Whisper me.

736
00:37:00.287 --> 00:37:01.455
No. No!

737
00:37:01.488 --> 00:37:03.624
Ahh! Ahh! No.

738
00:37:03.657 --> 00:37:05.375
- Get the chair!
- Take the cart.

739
00:37:05.439 --> 00:37:06.406
They're okay.

740
00:37:07.561 --> 00:37:09.443
- You all right?
- He's okay.

741
00:37:09.468 --> 00:37:10.703
- Okay.
- He's okay.

742
00:37:13.973 --> 00:37:15.975
It's a repeat of
Skipper in Key West.

743
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.788
And with all due respect,
that was Skipper, sir.

744
00:37:19.813 --> 00:37:22.805
This is... Barbie.

745
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.313
If this got out

746
00:37:26.346 --> 00:37:28.885
that our dolls were coming to
Los Angeles from Barbie Land

747
00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:31.311
as life-size versions
of themselves...

748
00:37:32.321 --> 00:37:34.122
roaming the earth...

749
00:37:35.457 --> 00:37:37.526
this would be very bad.

750
00:37:37.788 --> 00:37:40.141
Barbie in the Real World?

751
00:37:40.727 --> 00:37:42.329
That's impossible.

752
00:37:42.362 --> 00:37:44.565
We've got a definite
situation on our hands.

753
00:37:44.598 --> 00:37:46.702
Catastrophic!

754
00:37:46.727 --> 00:37:49.770
- I can't stress that enough!
- What?

755
00:37:49.803 --> 00:37:51.895
- What's your name again?
- Aaron Dinkins, sir.

756
00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.389
- Aaron Dickinson?
- Dinkins.

757
00:37:53.414 --> 00:37:54.508
Yes! Aaron.

758
00:37:54.541 --> 00:37:56.272
Is Barbie Land like
an alternate reality

759
00:37:56.297 --> 00:37:58.823
or is it like a place
where your imagination...

760
00:37:58.848 --> 00:37:59.916
Yes!

761
00:38:00.077 --> 00:38:01.042
Okay.

762
00:38:01.067 --> 00:38:04.375
Think of it as a town in
Sweden, Aaron Dinkins.

763
00:38:04.451 --> 00:38:05.719
Sweden.

764
00:38:05.752 --> 00:38:07.287
Right.

765
00:38:09.088 --> 00:38:10.390
How much do you weigh?

766
00:38:10.424 --> 00:38:12.459
It doesn't matter.

767
00:38:12.493 --> 00:38:14.426
Sounds like a job for the box.

768
00:38:14.451 --> 00:38:19.123
No one rests until this
doll is back in a box.

769
00:38:20.313 --> 00:38:21.782
Look, Davy Crockett
Junior High School,

770
00:38:21.807 --> 00:38:22.975
just like I saw in my vision.

771
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.338
A man on a horse.

772
00:38:24.371 --> 00:38:26.303
I've started to get all
these weirdo feelings.

773
00:38:26.328 --> 00:38:29.225
Like, I have fear with
no specific object.

774
00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:31.043
- What is that?
- It's anxiety.

775
00:38:31.085 --> 00:38:33.514
I have it too. They're
just awful at this age.

776
00:38:33.539 --> 00:38:35.081
I feel amazing.

777
00:38:35.114 --> 00:38:37.284
That's because kids don't
take it out on the dads.

778
00:38:37.325 --> 00:38:39.528
She's gotta be here somewhere.

779
00:38:39.553 --> 00:38:40.787
I need to find her soon.

780
00:38:40.821 --> 00:38:42.689
I'm just gonna pop
into the library

781
00:38:42.723 --> 00:38:44.400
and see if I can find
any books on trucks.

782
00:38:44.424 --> 00:38:46.053
Okay, just don't get in trouble.

783
00:38:46.078 --> 00:38:48.110
I won't!

784
00:38:48.395 --> 00:38:51.139
<i>- ♪ Johnny, my baby, did it
always have to end this way? ♪</i>

785
00:38:51.163 --> 00:38:53.467
<i>♪ 'Cause one day ♪</i>

786
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:56.637
<i>- ♪ One day, my baby

787
00:38:59.473 --> 00:39:01.308

788
00:39:01.341 --> 00:39:02.676
What are you doing?

789
00:39:02.709 --> 00:39:05.512
Oh, uh, what's that girl's name?

790
00:39:05.862 --> 00:39:07.163
That's Sasha.

791
00:39:07.188 --> 00:39:08.147
Hey, Sasha!

792
00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:09.336
- Don't talk to her.
- Oh.

793
00:39:09.361 --> 00:39:12.508
Sasha can talk to you, but
you can never talk to Sasha.

794
00:39:12.533 --> 00:39:14.669
- She'll crush you.
- Don't worry.

795
00:39:14.694 --> 00:39:17.032
Everyone really likes me and
thinks I'm cool and pretty.

796
00:39:17.702 --> 00:39:18.770
Huh.

797
00:39:18.795 --> 00:39:19.796
Thank you.

798
00:39:22.997 --> 00:39:26.883
Hey, ladies. Sasha, what's up?

799
00:39:29.458 --> 00:39:30.725
Who are you?

800
00:39:32.954 --> 00:39:36.458
I'm only your favorite
woman of all time.

801
00:39:36.483 --> 00:39:38.317
Barbie!

802
00:39:39.421 --> 00:39:41.890
You really think you're Barbie?

803
00:39:41.915 --> 00:39:43.584
- Yeah.
- She's crazy.

804
00:39:43.617 --> 00:39:45.149
Do you think she escaped
from like an insane asylum?

805
00:39:45.174 --> 00:39:47.330
So you're like "Barbie" Barbie?
Like a professional bimbo?

806
00:39:47.354 --> 00:39:48.789
No. Barbie's not a bimbo.

807
00:39:48.822 --> 00:39:51.157
Barbie is a doctor and
a lawyer and a senator

808
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:52.968
and a Nobel Prize winner.

809
00:39:52.993 --> 00:39:54.694
You're a Nobel Prize winner?

810
00:39:54.719 --> 00:39:58.428
Oh. No, not me, but Barbie is.

811
00:39:58.453 --> 00:39:59.657
Yeah.

812
00:39:59.682 --> 00:40:03.258
Aren't you guys gonna thank
me and give me a big hug?

813
00:40:04.905 --> 00:40:07.173
For being your favorite toy?

814
00:40:07.207 --> 00:40:10.176
We haven't played with Barbie
since we were like five years old.

815
00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:12.144
Yeah, I hated dolls with hair.

816
00:40:12.178 --> 00:40:14.473
I mean, I'd play with Barbie, but
it was, like, the last resort.

817
00:40:14.498 --> 00:40:15.733
I loved Barbie.

818
00:40:16.672 --> 00:40:17.459
Oh.

819
00:40:17.484 --> 00:40:19.980
Anyways, even then, it
was horrible for us.

820
00:40:20.005 --> 00:40:21.547
It was horrible?

821
00:40:22.422 --> 00:40:23.690
Why?

822
00:40:23.724 --> 00:40:25.144
- Come on, Sasha.
- Give it to her.

823
00:40:25.169 --> 00:40:26.737
Destroy Barbie.

824
00:40:27.594 --> 00:40:31.298
Okay, Barbie, let's do this.

825
00:40:31.331 --> 00:40:34.534
You've been making women feel bad about
themselves since you were invented.

826
00:40:34.568 --> 00:40:36.403
I think you have that
the wrong way around.

827
00:40:36.436 --> 00:40:38.839
You represent everything
wrong with our culture.

828
00:40:38.872 --> 00:40:42.376
Sexualized capitalism,
unrealistic physical ideals...

829
00:40:42.409 --> 00:40:45.612
No, no, no. You're describing
something stereotypical.

830
00:40:45.646 --> 00:40:48.889
Barbie is so much
more than that.

831
00:40:48.914 --> 00:40:50.851
Look at yourself.

832
00:40:50.884 --> 00:40:54.077
Well, I am technically
Stereotypical Barbie.

833
00:40:54.102 --> 00:40:56.456
You set the feminist
movement back 50 years.

834
00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:58.525
You destroy girls'
innate sense of worth

835
00:40:58.558 --> 00:41:00.227
and you are killing the planet

836
00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:02.262
with your glorification
of rampant consumerism.

837
00:41:02.295 --> 00:41:06.780
No, I'm supposed to help you
and make you happy and powerful.

838
00:41:06.805 --> 00:41:08.335
Oh, I am powerful.

839
00:41:08.368 --> 00:41:10.705
And until you showed up here
and declared yourself Barbie,

840
00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:13.032
I hadn't thought about
you in years, you fascist!

841
00:41:17.471 --> 00:41:19.266
Oh. Um...

842
00:41:19.713 --> 00:41:21.149
Okay.

843
00:41:21.292 --> 00:41:24.046
It's happening
again. I have to...

844
00:41:24.071 --> 00:41:25.594
Will you excuse me?

845
00:41:25.619 --> 00:41:28.125
It was really nice
talking to you.

846
00:41:35.543 --> 00:41:37.078
They never listen.

847
00:41:50.603 --> 00:41:52.372
Excuse me, sir, do
you have the time?

848
00:41:53.013 --> 00:41:54.514
You respect me.

849
00:41:54.548 --> 00:41:56.703
Sorry, no, do you
know what time it is?

850
00:41:57.594 --> 00:41:59.029
No, I do not.

851
00:42:00.524 --> 00:42:01.430
Okay.

852
00:42:01.455 --> 00:42:03.670
Why didn't Barbie tell
me about patriarchy,

853
00:42:03.695 --> 00:42:05.030
which, to my understanding,

854
00:42:05.055 --> 00:42:07.335
is where men and
horses run everything?

855
00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.762
Sure.

856
00:42:08.795 --> 00:42:10.889
I shall seek my fortune there.

857
00:42:10.914 --> 00:42:13.633
All right. So...

858
00:42:13.667 --> 00:42:16.369
I'll take a high-level, high-paying
job with influence, please.

859
00:42:16.403 --> 00:42:17.928
Okay, you'll need
at least an MBA.

860
00:42:17.953 --> 00:42:19.306
And a lot of our
people have PhDs.

861
00:42:19.339 --> 00:42:20.774
Isn't being a man enough?

862
00:42:20.807 --> 00:42:22.552
Actually, right now, it's
kind of the opposite.

863
00:42:22.576 --> 00:42:25.479
You guys are clearly not
doing patriarchy very well.

864
00:42:25.512 --> 00:42:28.548
No! No. We're, uh...

865
00:42:28.582 --> 00:42:32.272
We're doing it well, yeah. We
just... hide it better now.

866
00:42:32.297 --> 00:42:33.887
Oh.

867
00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:37.457
No, I won't let you do
just one appendectomy.

868
00:42:37.491 --> 00:42:39.116
- But I'm a man.
- But not a doctor.

869
00:42:39.141 --> 00:42:40.469
- Please?
- No.

870
00:42:40.494 --> 00:42:42.171
- Can I talk to a doctor?
- You are talking to a doctor.

871
00:42:42.196 --> 00:42:43.735
- Can you get me a coffee?
- No.

872
00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:44.804
- And I need a clicky pen.
- No.

873
00:42:44.829 --> 00:42:45.897
- And a white coat.
- No.

874
00:42:45.922 --> 00:42:47.078
- And a sharp thing.
- No.

875
00:42:47.103 --> 00:42:49.037
- There he is. Doctor!
- Somebody get security.

876
00:42:49.062 --> 00:42:51.230
I'd like to apply for
your job of beach.

877
00:42:51.255 --> 00:42:52.890
So, you want to be a lifeguard?

878
00:42:52.915 --> 00:42:55.351
Oh. I'm not trained
to go over there.

879
00:42:55.376 --> 00:42:57.678
I'm trained to stand
confidently right here.

880
00:42:57.703 --> 00:42:59.311
There's nobody in danger here.

881
00:42:59.336 --> 00:43:01.796
And even if there were, I'm
not trained to save them.

882
00:43:01.821 --> 00:43:03.198
Then I can't hire you.

883
00:43:03.228 --> 00:43:05.130
I can't even beach here!

884
00:43:08.955 --> 00:43:11.424
She thinks I'm a fascist?

885
00:43:11.458 --> 00:43:15.562
I don't control the railways
or the flow of commerce.

886
00:43:17.964 --> 00:43:19.514
- There you are.
- Oh, no.

887
00:43:19.539 --> 00:43:21.020
That went terrible.

888
00:43:21.045 --> 00:43:24.548
I need to find somewhere where
I can start patriarchy fresh.

889
00:43:28.408 --> 00:43:29.476
Miss Barbie?

890
00:43:29.509 --> 00:43:30.950
It's just Barbie.

891
00:43:30.975 --> 00:43:32.710
We're gonna need
you to come with us.

892
00:43:32.735 --> 00:43:34.399
Oh.

893
00:43:34.648 --> 00:43:36.416
- Who are you?
- We're Mattel.

894
00:43:36.457 --> 00:43:38.126
- Mattel?
- Mattel.

895
00:43:38.151 --> 00:43:40.113
Oh, thank goodness!

896
00:43:40.138 --> 00:43:42.292
I've gotta talk to
somebody in charge.

897
00:43:42.317 --> 00:43:43.886
Everything is backwards here.

898
00:43:43.911 --> 00:43:45.746
Men look at me
like I'm an object.

899
00:43:45.771 --> 00:43:47.027
Girls hate me.

900
00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:49.445
Everyone thinks I'm crazy,
and I keep getting arrested.

901
00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:50.714
Need you to step
this way, ma'am.

902
00:43:50.739 --> 00:43:52.399
I also just learned to cry.

903
00:43:52.432 --> 00:43:54.668
First, I got one tear and
then I got a whole bunch.

904
00:43:54.693 --> 00:43:56.261
What do I do? Do
I follow Barbie

905
00:43:56.286 --> 00:43:58.872
into that scary unmarked
black truck car?

906
00:43:58.905 --> 00:44:01.775
A truck car I'd like
to have, actually.

907
00:44:01.808 --> 00:44:04.972
You're right, she's
fine. It's Mattel.

908
00:44:04.997 --> 00:44:06.614
- Yeah.
- I know.

909
00:44:06.639 --> 00:44:08.989
I'll go back to Barbie Land, and
I'll tell the Kens what I've learned.

910
00:44:09.014 --> 00:44:10.254
Oh, it's going to be beautiful!

911
00:44:11.117 --> 00:44:12.372
Okay.

912
00:44:12.397 --> 00:44:14.399
- Back to Barbie Land.
- Let's go that way.

913
00:44:15.455 --> 00:44:17.390
- Hi, Bunny Boo-Boo.
- Don't call me that.

914
00:44:17.424 --> 00:44:19.993
Sorry. I'm off early
because of a crisis at work,

915
00:44:20.026 --> 00:44:22.796
but I thought we could
go get some soft serve.

916
00:44:22.829 --> 00:44:25.432
Thank God they
arrested that nutjob.

917
00:44:25.465 --> 00:44:26.633
Um, um...

918
00:44:26.666 --> 00:44:28.835
that reality-challenged woman.

919
00:44:28.869 --> 00:44:30.425
She thinks she's Barbie.

920
00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:31.771
Wait, what did you say?

921
00:44:31.805 --> 00:44:34.608
She thinks she's Barbie.
She's, like, fully convinced.

922
00:44:36.009 --> 00:44:38.129
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

923
00:44:38.154 --> 00:44:39.823
Mom. Mom!

924
00:44:40.595 --> 00:44:42.564
Mom, get back in the car!

925
00:44:44.451 --> 00:44:45.752
Are you kidding me?

926
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:48.521
Mom!

927
00:44:50.657 --> 00:44:54.160
Mattel! Of course it was you
guys that brought me here.

928
00:44:54.194 --> 00:44:57.464
Because it definitely
wasn't that Sasha girl.

929
00:44:57.497 --> 00:44:59.733
Thanks for the ride. This
has been so much fun.

930
00:44:59.766 --> 00:45:02.903
Wow, the mothership!

931
00:45:07.574 --> 00:45:10.144
- Barbie!
- We're so happy to see you.

932
00:45:10.169 --> 00:45:12.178
- Hi!
- Would you like some mineral water?

933
00:45:12.213 --> 00:45:14.006
Yes, thank you.

934
00:45:14.031 --> 00:45:15.266
Oh, thanks.

935
00:45:17.796 --> 00:45:19.798
I'm not used to that
having anything in it.

936
00:45:24.021 --> 00:45:24.974
Thank you.

937
00:45:24.999 --> 00:45:27.770
So, we've been very anxious to get
some quality face-time with you.

938
00:45:27.795 --> 00:45:29.480
Of course. So what can I do

939
00:45:29.505 --> 00:45:31.895
to repair the rift in
the space-time continuum,

940
00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:33.788
get my feet back, and
that one cellulite gone,

941
00:45:33.813 --> 00:45:36.316
and just generally not
turn into Weird Barbie?

942
00:45:36.341 --> 00:45:39.506
We have been discussing
that very topic.

943
00:45:39.539 --> 00:45:42.180
If you're agreeable to
it, we would love it

944
00:45:42.205 --> 00:45:46.096
if you could just get
into that giant box.

945
00:45:48.715 --> 00:45:50.922
Get into the box and you'll
go back to Barbie Land.

946
00:45:50.947 --> 00:45:53.422
And everything
will be as it was.

947
00:45:53.447 --> 00:45:55.961
You know what? We should
probably get Ken first.

948
00:45:55.986 --> 00:45:56.823
Ken?

949
00:45:56.856 --> 00:45:57.891
Ken.

950
00:45:57.924 --> 00:45:59.454
You know, Ken. Barbie and Ken.

951
00:45:59.479 --> 00:46:00.827
Oh!

952
00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:03.211
- Yes, Ken. Yeah.
- Ken. The guy. Yeah.

953
00:46:05.031 --> 00:46:07.942
Back to Barbie Land!

954
00:46:08.313 --> 00:46:10.348
I'm gonna be sick.
I'm gonna be sick.

955
00:46:10.952 --> 00:46:14.247
Ken isn't something
we're worried about.

956
00:46:14.594 --> 00:46:15.817
Ever.

957
00:46:16.076 --> 00:46:18.352
Okay, I'll just, um...
I'll get in the box then.

958
00:46:18.377 --> 00:46:19.586
All right! Yes!

959
00:46:21.042 --> 00:46:23.344
Oh. But since I
came all this way,

960
00:46:23.369 --> 00:46:25.520
could I just meet
the woman in charge,

961
00:46:25.545 --> 00:46:27.153
your CEO?

962
00:46:27.187 --> 00:46:28.788
Oh, that would be me.

963
00:46:28.813 --> 00:46:30.293
- Oh. Your CFO.
- Me.

964
00:46:30.318 --> 00:46:31.624
- Your COO.
- Here.

965
00:46:31.658 --> 00:46:32.802
President of the
Barbie division.

966
00:46:32.826 --> 00:46:34.070
- Present.
- I'm a man with no power.

967
00:46:34.094 --> 00:46:36.196
Does that make me a woman?

968
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:38.665
Are any women in charge?

969
00:46:38.698 --> 00:46:42.135
Listen, I know exactly where
you're going with this,

970
00:46:42.168 --> 00:46:44.838
and I have to say
I really resent it.

971
00:46:44.871 --> 00:46:47.926
We are a company
literally made of women.

972
00:46:47.951 --> 00:46:50.353
We had a woman CEO in the '90s.

973
00:46:50.417 --> 00:46:52.647
And there was another one...

974
00:46:53.419 --> 00:46:56.139
at some other time.

975
00:46:57.795 --> 00:47:00.231
So that's... That's
two right there.

976
00:47:00.256 --> 00:47:04.403
Women are the freaking
foundation of this very long

977
00:47:04.428 --> 00:47:05.992
phallic building.

978
00:47:06.026 --> 00:47:08.862
We have gender-neutral
bathrooms up the wazoo.

979
00:47:08.895 --> 00:47:11.798
Every single one of
these men love women.

980
00:47:11.831 --> 00:47:13.700
I'm the son of a mother.

981
00:47:13.733 --> 00:47:16.036
I'm the mother of a son.

982
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:19.806
I'm... I'm the nephew
of a woman aunt.

983
00:47:20.065 --> 00:47:21.920
Some of my best
friends are Jewish.

984
00:47:23.586 --> 00:47:25.169
What I'm trying to say is...

985
00:47:26.082 --> 00:47:28.114
Get in the box, you Jezebel!

986
00:47:28.848 --> 00:47:30.551
What? I can't say Jezebel now?

987
00:47:30.576 --> 00:47:33.119
I haven't been in a box in ages.

988
00:47:33.153 --> 00:47:34.904
See? It's easy.

989
00:47:36.122 --> 00:47:37.657
Oh, okay.

990
00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:38.981
Huh.

991
00:47:39.039 --> 00:47:41.861
Oh, my gosh. I
remember this smell.

992
00:47:41.895 --> 00:47:44.293
I'm having a real
Proustian flashback.

993
00:47:44.318 --> 00:47:47.801
Remember Proust Barbie?
That did not sell very well.

994
00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:55.653
Oh! Ha-ha!

995
00:47:55.678 --> 00:47:58.163
You know what? Um,
before I get in the box,

996
00:47:58.188 --> 00:47:59.433
could I just run to the restroom

997
00:47:59.458 --> 00:48:01.192
and make sure my
hair is perfect?

998
00:48:01.217 --> 00:48:03.553
- Fine. Can you be speedy about it?
- Mmm-hmm.

999
00:48:04.693 --> 00:48:06.471
- Down this way?
- It's just down the hallway.

1000
00:48:06.496 --> 00:48:08.568
- Thank you.
- On the right.

1001
00:48:12.797 --> 00:48:14.682
I guess she really had
to go to the bathroom.

1002
00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:17.162

- Oh!

1007
00:48:29.976 --> 00:48:32.178
Where's Barbie?

1008
00:48:32.361 --> 00:48:33.746
I'm gaining on you.

1009
00:48:35.316 --> 00:48:36.804

It's quicker to go
over the cubicles.

1015
00:48:44.617 --> 00:48:46.119

Don't worry. You're safe here.

1028
00:49:32.506 --> 00:49:34.481
What is this place?

1029
00:49:34.506 --> 00:49:39.076
I always find I think
best at kitchen tables.

1030
00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.274
Tea?

1031
00:49:44.262 --> 00:49:46.098
Uh, yes, please.

1032
00:49:50.823 --> 00:49:52.992

1033
00:49:53.026 --> 00:49:56.381
Oh, sweetie, we do
more than work here.

1034
00:50:03.724 --> 00:50:05.125
Thank you.

1035
00:50:25.363 --> 00:50:26.865
What?

1036
00:50:26.993 --> 00:50:29.170
It's because I don't
know how to drink tea?

1037
00:50:29.195 --> 00:50:32.865
No. You look different.

1038
00:50:32.899 --> 00:50:37.100
Oh. It's not how I normally
look. I usually look perfect.

1039
00:50:37.571 --> 00:50:39.506
Oh, I don't know.

1040
00:50:39.727 --> 00:50:42.028
I think you're just right.

1041
00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:51.936
Real World isn't what
I thought it was.

1042
00:50:53.043 --> 00:50:54.419
It never is.

1043
00:50:54.616 --> 00:50:56.451
And isn't that marvelous?

1044
00:50:57.894 --> 00:51:00.302
Who are you?

1045
00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:02.929
Which way did she
go? Who saw her last?

1046
00:51:02.962 --> 00:51:05.229
Uh, if you go
through that closet,

1047
00:51:05.254 --> 00:51:07.358
you'll find a stairwell
down to the lobby.

1048
00:51:07.383 --> 00:51:09.319
- Find her!
- Okay.

1049
00:51:12.310 --> 00:51:14.312
Thank you, um...

1050
00:51:15.242 --> 00:51:17.093
Ruth.

1051
00:51:17.677 --> 00:51:19.311
Ruth. Thank you, Ruth.

1052
00:51:20.624 --> 00:51:22.507
You're welcome, Barbie.

Oh! Uh, key card!

1060
00:51:43.802 --> 00:51:46.170
- Wait.
- I don't have my key card.

1061
00:51:48.195 --> 00:51:49.194
Get in!

1062
00:51:54.576 --> 00:51:56.934
Now! Get in now!

1063
00:51:57.749 --> 00:51:59.620
- Come on.
- Oh!

1064
00:51:59.653 --> 00:52:01.588
Ahh!

1065
00:52:01.622 --> 00:52:03.272
Okay.

1066
00:52:03.297 --> 00:52:05.860
Oh, no! Now we're
never gonna get Barbie!

1067
00:52:05.885 --> 00:52:07.286
Oh, we didn't need it!

1068
00:52:07.311 --> 00:52:08.961
Barbie!

1069
00:52:08.995 --> 00:52:11.298
Let's form a plan here.

1070
00:52:11.332 --> 00:52:14.601
I would normally have shotgun.
I'll go in the first one.

1071
00:52:15.033 --> 00:52:16.382
<i>Hang on.</i>

1072
00:52:18.104 --> 00:52:19.340
Ahh!

1073
00:52:19.373 --> 00:52:20.617
God, I hope nobody
from school saw us

1074
00:52:20.641 --> 00:52:22.875
put a life-size
Barbie in our car.

1075
00:52:22.909 --> 00:52:24.153
- How did this even happen?
- I don't know.

1076
00:52:24.177 --> 00:52:26.241
How are you here?
You're like an idea.

1077
00:52:26.266 --> 00:52:27.323
A great idea.

1078
00:52:27.348 --> 00:52:29.916
So, I've been a
little lonely lately.

1079
00:52:29.949 --> 00:52:31.951
And I found those Barbies
we used to play with...

1080
00:52:31.984 --> 00:52:33.805
- I thought we gave those away.
- Well, I started playing with them.

1081
00:52:33.830 --> 00:52:36.298
And making drawings like
we used to do. Remember?

1082
00:52:36.323 --> 00:52:37.860
Because I thought
it would be joyful.

1083
00:52:37.885 --> 00:52:39.193
- Was it?
- No, it wasn't.

1084
00:52:39.218 --> 00:52:40.427
I got sad and weird,

1085
00:52:40.452 --> 00:52:42.590
and then the drawings
got sad and weird,

1086
00:52:42.639 --> 00:52:45.007
and maybe because I
couldn't be like you,

1087
00:52:45.032 --> 00:52:46.740
I ended up making you like me.

1088
00:52:48.134 --> 00:52:49.670
Did any of these
drawings by chance

1089
00:52:49.703 --> 00:52:52.439
have thoughts of
death and cellulite?

1090
00:52:52.473 --> 00:52:55.628
Yes! Irrepressible
Thoughts of Death Barbie.

1091
00:52:55.653 --> 00:52:58.163
- Oh, my God!
- And Cellulite!

1092
00:53:01.315 --> 00:53:04.050
- I came for you!
- You came for me!

1093
00:53:04.223 --> 00:53:06.092
Those were <i>your</i> memories.

1094
00:53:31.899 --> 00:53:35.470
Hello? Hello? Hello?

1095
00:53:35.495 --> 00:53:38.427
Hello? Are you
two, like, shining?

1096
00:53:38.452 --> 00:53:40.220
No! No, it's nothing like that.

1097
00:53:40.254 --> 00:53:43.223
- Are you shining with a real Barbie?
- No!

1098
00:53:43.569 --> 00:53:45.513
I mean, maybe.
Like a little, yes.

1099
00:53:45.538 --> 00:53:47.107
I don't even know where to start

1100
00:53:47.132 --> 00:53:48.879
with this
wishing-a-Barbie-to-life crap.

1101
00:53:48.904 --> 00:53:50.309
Oh, Sasha, listen.

1102
00:53:50.334 --> 00:53:53.473
I'm just a boring mom with a boring
job and a daughter who hates me.

1103
00:53:53.498 --> 00:53:55.469
Can you blame me for wanting
to have a little fun?

1104
00:53:56.770 --> 00:53:58.205
I gotta lose these chuckleheads.

1105
00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:01.147
Ahh!

1106
00:54:01.172 --> 00:54:02.173
Mom!

1107
00:54:04.278 --> 00:54:06.045
I think I owe you
ladies an apology.

1108
00:54:06.078 --> 00:54:08.615
I thought that Barbie had
made the Real World better,

1109
00:54:08.649 --> 00:54:11.452
but the Real World is forever
and irrevocably messed up!

1110
00:54:11.485 --> 00:54:14.455
Well, the Real World is not
perfect, but you inspired me.

1111
00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:19.025
I love women. I
want to help women.

1112
00:54:19.058 --> 00:54:20.728
Oh, come off it,
everybody hates women.

1113
00:54:20.753 --> 00:54:22.254
Women hate women,
and men hate women.

1114
00:54:22.279 --> 00:54:23.492
It's the one thing
we can all agree on.

1115
00:54:23.516 --> 00:54:24.950
- Is that true?
- It's complicated.

1116
00:54:24.975 --> 00:54:26.643
- Hate is a strong word.
- Wake up, Mom!

1117
00:54:28.167 --> 00:54:30.357
I am wide awake, Sasha!

1118
00:54:33.707 --> 00:54:36.575
Mom, where did you learn
to drive like this?

1119
00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:39.011
- There was this guy.
- Was it Dad?

1120
00:54:39.045 --> 00:54:41.013
Yeah, yeah, it
was... It was Dad.

1121
00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:02.369
Okay, duck.

1122
00:55:02.557 --> 00:55:03.935
- You look so pretty.
- Don't look at me.

1123
00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:05.160
Okay, sorry.

1124
00:55:09.804 --> 00:55:12.654
I can't hold them off
forever. Where can we go?

1125
00:55:12.679 --> 00:55:15.958
Wait, I have an idea. Can
you get us to Venice Beach?

1126
00:55:15.983 --> 00:55:17.251
Sure can.

1127
00:55:17.284 --> 00:55:20.051
Ah! I love Rollerblades.
Where are we going?

1128
00:55:20.076 --> 00:55:21.911
- Barbie Land.
- What? Mom!

1129
00:55:21.936 --> 00:55:23.771
Are you really gonna let Barbie

1130
00:55:23.796 --> 00:55:26.192
take you and your tween
daughter to an imaginary land?

1131
00:55:26.226 --> 00:55:28.438
Yes, and you wanna know why?
Because I never get to do anything.

1132
00:55:28.462 --> 00:55:30.707
I didn't even go on that cruise
I won at your school raffle

1133
00:55:30.731 --> 00:55:32.972
because I didn't have enough vacation
days and your dad's allergic to sun.

1134
00:55:32.997 --> 00:55:35.365
- Oh.
- What about Dad? We can't just leave him!

1135
00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:36.603
He'll be fine.

1136
00:55:36.966 --> 00:55:38.167
<i>Bolígrafos.</i>

1137
00:55:38.192 --> 00:55:39.527
<i>Bolígrafos.</i>

1138
00:55:39.552 --> 00:55:40.720
<i>Bolígrafos.</i>

1139
00:55:42.591 --> 00:55:43.601
Yeah, yeah. He'll be fine.

1140
00:55:43.626 --> 00:55:44.894
Ready for fun?

1141
00:55:44.919 --> 00:55:46.286
- Yes!
- Great!

1142
00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:47.772
Here we go!

1143
00:55:47.797 --> 00:55:50.627
Come on and feel the magic.

1144
00:55:50.652 --> 00:55:52.721
Where are we?

1145
00:55:52.746 --> 00:55:54.057
How did we get
into these clothes?

1146
00:55:54.082 --> 00:55:55.617
How did we get
into this vehicle?

1147
00:55:55.642 --> 00:55:57.376
When I was a kid,
I lost these boots

1148
00:55:57.401 --> 00:55:59.403
and my mom wouldn't let
me buy a whole new Barbie

1149
00:55:59.428 --> 00:56:00.569
just to replace the boots.

1150
00:56:00.594 --> 00:56:02.362
- They look so good on you.
- Why, thank you.

1151
00:56:02.387 --> 00:56:04.455
- Hey, you!
- She was always my favorite Barbie.

1152
00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:05.942
You're my favorite human.

1153
00:56:05.967 --> 00:56:08.703
Don't tell him, but
I never got a Ken.

1154
00:56:08.728 --> 00:56:11.286
That's because Ken is
totally superfluous.

1155
00:56:11.858 --> 00:56:12.794
I didn't say that.

1156
00:56:12.819 --> 00:56:15.576
Women hold all major positions
of power, control all the money.

1157
00:56:15.609 --> 00:56:17.596
Basically, everything
that men do in your world,

1158
00:56:17.621 --> 00:56:18.961
women do in ours.

1159
00:56:18.986 --> 00:56:20.263
I mean, that sounds
kind of cool.

1160
00:56:20.288 --> 00:56:22.516
Sasha, look, dolphins!

Oh, and we have a
female president

1166
00:56:32.826 --> 00:56:35.729
and it's fun and work and
friendship and female 24/7.

1167
00:56:35.762 --> 00:56:37.764
Do giant hands come
in and play with you?

1168
00:56:37.798 --> 00:56:39.466
No, that's crazy.

1169
00:56:39.499 --> 00:56:41.868
Excuse me. Have you seen a
group of women on wheels?

1170
00:56:41.902 --> 00:56:43.503
Actually, yeah,

1171
00:56:43.537 --> 00:56:44.747
there was a blonde, a
brunette and a tween.

1172
00:56:44.771 --> 00:56:45.782
They Rollerbladed
in that direction.

1173
00:56:45.806 --> 00:56:47.541
Oh, no.

1174
00:56:47.574 --> 00:56:49.710
First step is always
Rollerblading.

1175
00:56:49.743 --> 00:56:50.811
Excuse me, sir?

1176
00:56:50.844 --> 00:56:53.179
They've gone to Barbie Land.

1177
00:56:53.213 --> 00:56:54.891
- Oh, no.
- And she's brought humans there with her.

1178
00:56:54.915 --> 00:56:56.893
This could mean extremely
weird things for our world.

1179
00:56:56.917 --> 00:56:58.485
Like what?

1180
00:56:58.518 --> 00:57:00.186
Nothing any of our
collective imaginations

1181
00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:01.355
could ever dream up.

1182
00:57:01.388 --> 00:57:04.725
A podcast hosted
by two wise trees.

1183
00:57:04.758 --> 00:57:08.261
Or a choir of 2,000
young fathers.

1184
00:57:08.295 --> 00:57:10.931
Not even close. We've got
to get to Barbie Land.

1185
00:57:10.964 --> 00:57:15.402
Go! Find some blades now!
Just pick a direction and run!

1186
00:57:15.435 --> 00:57:19.239
I can practically feel my
heels lifting already. Yes!

1187
00:57:19.272 --> 00:57:21.942
This is what I was supposed
to do. Bring you back here.

1188
00:57:21.975 --> 00:57:24.176
- It feels right.
- It does.

1189
00:57:24.211 --> 00:57:25.846
Okay, this is...

1190
00:57:25.879 --> 00:57:28.315

1194

So, that's our
president, with the beer.

1195
00:57:42.863 --> 00:57:45.766
And the cheering squad
is the Supreme Court.

1196
00:57:45.799 --> 00:57:48.869
This is so much better
than being president.

1197
00:57:48.902 --> 00:57:51.304
Something's weird today.

1198
00:57:51.338 --> 00:57:52.739
Hi, Barbie!

1199
00:57:53.674 --> 00:57:55.676
Oh, okay. Hi, Ken.

1200
00:57:55.709 --> 00:58:00.313
- Have a brewski beer. My big guy is thirsty.
- Ah.

1201
00:58:01.381 --> 00:58:03.417
Anyway, uh...

1202
00:58:03.450 --> 00:58:04.985
Wait until you
see my Dreamhouse.

1203
00:58:05.018 --> 00:58:07.587
Everything I've bought and
own will totally inspire you.

1204
00:58:07.621 --> 00:58:09.188

- That's the Capitol.
- Ah!

1206
00:58:13.927 --> 00:58:15.629
- It's pink?
- Pink!

1207
00:58:15.662 --> 00:58:16.863
And that's the...

1208
00:58:18.865 --> 00:58:21.001
♪ <i>You think That
women rule the world ♪</i>

1209
00:58:21.034 --> 00:58:23.937
These are the Dreamhouses.
This is where I live.

1210
00:58:23.970 --> 00:58:26.006
You can see through the houses.

1211
00:58:26.039 --> 00:58:28.341
So does each Barbie, like,
have their own house?

1212
00:58:28.375 --> 00:58:29.976
- Mmm-hmm.
- That's cool.

1213
00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:31.578
Where do the Kens stay?

1214
00:58:32.479 --> 00:58:34.247
I don't know.

1215
00:58:34.281 --> 00:58:36.750
At first I thought the
Real World was run by men.

1216
00:58:36.783 --> 00:58:38.285
And then there was a minute

1217
00:58:38.318 --> 00:58:40.887
where I thought it
was run by horses.

1218
00:58:40.921 --> 00:58:43.924
But then I realized that
horses are just men extenders.

1219
00:58:43.957 --> 00:58:46.460
- Oh!
- Hmm?

1220
00:58:46.493 --> 00:58:48.428
Oh. I had that treehouse.

1221
00:58:48.462 --> 00:58:50.530
I saved up my
allowance to buy it.

1222
00:58:50.564 --> 00:58:55.035
I've never seen a car like that
before. What happened here?

1223
00:58:55.068 --> 00:58:57.804
Everything, basically
everything exists

1224
00:58:57.838 --> 00:59:00.674
to expand and elevate
the presence of men.

1225
00:59:00.707 --> 00:59:02.609
- That's amazing.
- That's beautiful.

1226
00:59:02.642 --> 00:59:03.920
- I know.
- Barbie's here.

1227
00:59:03.944 --> 00:59:05.045
Uh-oh.

1228
00:59:05.078 --> 00:59:08.315
Ken?

1229
00:59:08.348 --> 00:59:10.317
What have you done?

1230
00:59:10.350 --> 00:59:12.853
What are you wearing?

1231
00:59:12.886 --> 00:59:15.822
Don't question it. Just
roll with it, tiny baby.

1232
00:59:15.856 --> 00:59:17.791
- Tiny baby.
- Don't call me baby.

1233
00:59:17.824 --> 00:59:19.793
What about mini-baby?
Like this mini-fridge.

1234
00:59:20.761 --> 00:59:22.529
No, Ken.

1235
00:59:22.562 --> 00:59:25.832
This is my Dreamhouse. It
is my Dreamhouse! It's mine!

1236
00:59:25.866 --> 00:59:27.901
No, this is no longer
Barbie's Dreamhouse.

1237
00:59:27.934 --> 00:59:33.573
This shall henceforth be known
as Ken's Mojo Dojo Casa House.

1238
00:59:33.607 --> 00:59:35.575
You don't have to
say dojo and house.

1239
00:59:35.609 --> 00:59:36.943
And casa...

1240
00:59:36.977 --> 00:59:38.979
But you do because it
feels good. Try it.

1241
00:59:39.012 --> 00:59:41.381
- Mojo Dojo Casa...
- No, girls. Don't say it.

1242
00:59:41.414 --> 00:59:43.450
Mojo Dojo Casa House.

1243
00:59:45.385 --> 00:59:46.763
Give it to me straight.
How weird is it?

1244
00:59:46.787 --> 00:59:49.756
Whoa, boss, these
Mojo Dojo Casa Houses

1245
00:59:49.790 --> 00:59:51.992
are literally flying
off the shelves.

1246
00:59:52.025 --> 00:59:56.363
The kids are clamoring for
them. Ken is on T-shirts, mugs.

1247
00:59:56.396 --> 00:59:58.498
- It's the number one tattoo.
- Oh, no.

1248
00:59:58.532 --> 01:00:01.468
Warner Bros. have started
auditions for the Ken movie,

1249
01:00:01.501 --> 01:00:05.405
which is already
a blockbuster hit.

1250
01:00:05.438 --> 01:00:07.083
It's happening. That thing
we could never imagine.

1251
01:00:07.107 --> 01:00:08.675
If we don't get my words lady...

1252
01:00:08.708 --> 01:00:10.644
- Executive Assistant.
- My Executive Words Lady

1253
01:00:10.677 --> 01:00:11.954
and someone who's
probably her daughter

1254
01:00:11.978 --> 01:00:13.480
back here and close the portal,

1255
01:00:13.513 --> 01:00:14.915
our worlds could
be altered forever.

1256
01:00:14.948 --> 01:00:16.826
Well, what does it matter
if it's Barbie or Ken?

1257
01:00:16.850 --> 01:00:18.118
The money is pouring in.

1258
01:00:18.151 --> 01:00:20.520
Shame on you,
Executive Number Two.

1259
01:00:20.554 --> 01:00:22.622
You think I spent my
entire life in boardrooms

1260
01:00:22.656 --> 01:00:23.757
because of a bottom line?

1261
01:00:23.790 --> 01:00:25.358
No! I got into this business

1262
01:00:25.392 --> 01:00:27.594
because of little
girls and their dreams.

1263
01:00:27.627 --> 01:00:29.830
In the least creepy
way possible.

1264
01:00:29.863 --> 01:00:32.833
Now, blade faster.
Time is running out.

1265
01:00:32.866 --> 01:00:35.502
Look, I'm just having
some brewski beers

1266
01:00:35.535 --> 01:00:37.771
at my Mojo Dojo Casa House.

1267
01:00:37.804 --> 01:00:39.472
Ken!

1268
01:00:39.506 --> 01:00:41.007
You can stay if you want,

1269
01:00:41.041 --> 01:00:42.776
as my bride wife,

1270
01:00:42.809 --> 01:00:45.478
or my long-term-low-
commitment-distance girlfriend.

1271
01:00:45.512 --> 01:00:46.947
- What do you say?
- Ugh.

1272
01:00:47.814 --> 01:00:49.049
Brewski beer me?

1273
01:00:49.082 --> 01:00:51.918
I will not brewski beer you.

1274
01:00:51.952 --> 01:00:54.554
Ha-ha-ha. That's fine.

1275
01:00:54.588 --> 01:00:56.432
You know, now that you Barbies
aren't around to run everything,

1276
01:00:56.456 --> 01:00:58.083
we can do our hair
however we like.

1277
01:00:58.108 --> 01:00:59.159
I have hats.

1278
01:00:59.192 --> 01:01:02.629
Where are my hungry
boys? Who wants snacks?

1279
01:01:02.662 --> 01:01:04.880
Barbie, I am so
happy to see you.

1280
01:01:04.905 --> 01:01:06.084
Can you believe
what is happening?

1281
01:01:06.108 --> 01:01:07.833
I know. Isn't it great?

1282
01:01:07.858 --> 01:01:10.224
Anyone need a brewski beer?

1283
01:01:10.249 --> 01:01:12.963
What are you doing?
You're a doctor.

1284
01:01:12.988 --> 01:01:14.857
I like being a
helpful decoration.

1285
01:01:14.882 --> 01:01:17.544
And Allan likes to help me give
all the Kens foot massages.

1286
01:01:17.577 --> 01:01:18.989
No, I don't, I don't like that.

1287
01:01:19.014 --> 01:01:20.139
We love it.

1288
01:01:20.164 --> 01:01:22.991
- Ugh, so gross.
- I'm so blotto-faced day-drunk right now.

1289
01:01:23.049 --> 01:01:24.600
Ditto same-same that.

1290
01:01:24.625 --> 01:01:26.366
I like not having to
make any decisions.

1291
01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:29.178
It's like a spa day
for my brain. Forever.

1292
01:01:29.203 --> 01:01:30.799
What is wrong with them?

1293
01:01:30.824 --> 01:01:32.381
We just explained to
them the immaculate,

1294
01:01:32.405 --> 01:01:33.827
impeccable seamless
garment of logic

1295
01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:35.462
that is patriarchy,
and they crumbled.

1296
01:01:35.495 --> 01:01:37.664
Oh, my God. This is
like in the 1500s

1297
01:01:37.697 --> 01:01:39.622
with the indigenous
people and smallpox.

1298
01:01:39.647 --> 01:01:41.099
They had no defenses against it.

1299
01:01:41.124 --> 01:01:44.137
Yeah. Buckle up, babe.

1300
01:01:44.170 --> 01:01:47.607
Because Barbie Land
is now Ken Land.

1301
01:01:47.641 --> 01:01:50.110
And it's gonna be just like
Century City in Los Angeles,

1302
01:01:50.143 --> 01:01:53.763
because they had it all
figured out in Century City.

1303
01:01:53.788 --> 01:01:55.849
The minute you get out
of your car, you're like,

1304
01:01:55.882 --> 01:01:58.551
"I can't believe how
great this place is!"

1305
01:01:58.585 --> 01:02:01.216
No, no, no. They don't have
it figured out in Century City

1306
01:02:01.241 --> 01:02:03.056
because we failed them.

1307
01:02:03.089 --> 01:02:05.458
No! You failed me!

1308
01:02:11.372 --> 01:02:13.940
Out there, I was somebody.

1309
01:02:15.735 --> 01:02:17.803
And when I walked
down the street...

1310
01:02:19.878 --> 01:02:22.681
people respected me
just for who I am.

1311
01:02:25.655 --> 01:02:29.858
One lady, she even
asked me for the time.

1312
01:02:29.883 --> 01:02:30.618
No way!

1313
01:02:30.643 --> 01:02:31.983
Way.

1314
01:02:34.621 --> 01:02:36.310
And if it weren't for
these technicalities

1315
01:02:36.335 --> 01:02:38.625
like MBAs, medical degrees,

1316
01:02:38.658 --> 01:02:43.697
and I don't know, swim lessons,
I could have ruled that world.

1317
01:02:43.730 --> 01:02:45.600
But I don't need any
of those things here.

1318
01:02:51.518 --> 01:02:55.154
Here, I'm just a dude.
And you know what?

1319
01:02:59.259 --> 01:03:00.466
That's enough.

1320
01:03:00.491 --> 01:03:01.892
TV remote.

1321
01:03:05.952 --> 01:03:07.153
Which one is it?

1322
01:03:07.187 --> 01:03:09.022
Oh, it's that one right there.

1323
01:03:09.968 --> 01:03:12.343
<i>Call me Mister Ken President
Prime Minister, ma'am.</i>

1324
01:03:12.368 --> 01:03:14.036
<i>Let's recap all
the amazing changes</i>

1325
01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:15.595
<i>and innovations
thanks to the Kens.</i>

1326
01:03:15.628 --> 01:03:18.233
<i>The Nobel Prize in
horses goes to...</i>

1327
01:03:18.554 --> 01:03:19.733
<i>Ken!</i>

1328
01:03:19.851 --> 01:03:21.944
<i>Ken! Ken! Ken! Ken! Ken!</i>

1329
01:03:23.311 --> 01:03:26.060
<i>Wow. And now you're
making it permanent</i>

1330
01:03:26.085 --> 01:03:29.088
<i>with a special election to
change the Constitution.</i>

1331
01:03:29.175 --> 01:03:30.677
<i>That's right. In
just 48 hours,</i>

1332
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:32.679
<i>all the Kens will
head to the polls</i>

1333
01:03:32.712 --> 01:03:34.224
<i>and vote to change the
Constitution to a government</i>

1334
01:03:34.248 --> 01:03:37.257
<i>for the Kens, of the
Kens, and by the Kens!</i>

1335
01:03:41.763 --> 01:03:43.765
You can't do this.

1336
01:03:43.790 --> 01:03:45.226
This is Barbie Land.

1337
01:03:45.259 --> 01:03:47.261
The Barbies worked hard
and they dreamed hard

1338
01:03:47.294 --> 01:03:50.163
to make it everything
that it is. You...

1339
01:03:50.196 --> 01:03:53.633
You can't just undo it in a day.

1340
01:03:53.837 --> 01:03:56.257
Literally and
figuratively, watch me.

1341
01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:01.116
Now, if you'll excuse me...

1342
01:04:01.141 --> 01:04:05.246
this is my Mojo Dojo
Casa House, it's not

1343
01:04:05.497 --> 01:04:08.467
Barbie's Mojo Dojo Casa House.

1344
01:04:09.992 --> 01:04:10.993
Right?

1345
01:04:15.370 --> 01:04:16.804
How's that feel?

1346
01:04:20.396 --> 01:04:22.733
It is not fun, is it?

1347
01:04:24.363 --> 01:04:26.913
It's boys' night!

1348
01:04:42.202 --> 01:04:44.116
Every night is boys' night.

1349
01:04:48.054 --> 01:04:50.957
Go, Ken! Go, Ken! Go, Ken!

1350
01:04:56.397 --> 01:05:00.401
Barbie! Take your lady
fashions with you.

1351
01:05:00.434 --> 01:05:03.937
Take your Celebrate
Disco Bell Bottoms...

1352
01:05:03.970 --> 01:05:05.672
Oh!

1353
01:05:05.705 --> 01:05:08.108
And your Ice Capades
Pretty Practice Suit

1354
01:05:08.141 --> 01:05:09.843
and Dazzling Show Skirt.

1355
01:05:09.876 --> 01:05:11.744
These are archival.

1356
01:05:11.778 --> 01:05:14.348
Your Pajama Jam
in Amsterdam sets.

1357
01:05:14.381 --> 01:05:15.882
No!

1358
01:05:15.915 --> 01:05:18.118
And your Pretty
Paisley Palazzo Pants!

1359
01:05:19.453 --> 01:05:22.389
- Not the Palazzos!
- And get out!

1360
01:05:25.359 --> 01:05:27.127
Maybe this could fit me.

1361
01:05:30.297 --> 01:05:31.898
Honey.

1362
01:05:31.931 --> 01:05:34.000
Why did you wish me to
your messed-up world

1363
01:05:34.033 --> 01:05:38.071
using your complicated
human thoughts and feelings?

1364
01:05:38.104 --> 01:05:41.141
- What?
- Barbie Land was perfect before.

1365
01:05:42.243 --> 01:05:45.011
I was perfect before.

1366
01:05:45.044 --> 01:05:48.715
I'm so sorry. I wasn't
trying to do anything.

1367
01:05:48.748 --> 01:05:50.348
Don't apologize.

1368
01:05:50.783 --> 01:05:52.253
Don't blame my mom.

1369
01:05:52.286 --> 01:05:54.053
Aw, Sasha, that's sweet.

1370
01:05:54.087 --> 01:05:57.123
Maybe you wished us. Maybe
it's your fault, Barbie.

1371
01:05:57.157 --> 01:05:58.401
No, I didn't wish anything.

1372
01:05:58.425 --> 01:06:01.761
I've never wanted
anything to change.

1373
01:06:01.794 --> 01:06:07.000
Oh, honey, that's
life. It's all change.

1374
01:06:08.001 --> 01:06:09.336
That's...

1375
01:06:09.370 --> 01:06:11.070
That's terrifying.

1376
01:06:15.376 --> 01:06:16.310
I don't want that.

1377
01:06:17.844 --> 01:06:20.414
Not my life. No, thank you.

1378
01:06:20.447 --> 01:06:23.883
Just, no, I don't want this.

1379
01:06:30.324 --> 01:06:32.926
I'm just gonna sit
here and wait and hope

1380
01:06:32.959 --> 01:06:35.762
that one of the more
leadership-oriented Barbies

1381
01:06:35.795 --> 01:06:37.764
just snaps out of it

1382
01:06:37.797 --> 01:06:39.766
and does something
about this whole mess.

1383
01:06:39.799 --> 01:06:42.303
I really understand
this feeling.

1384
01:06:42.336 --> 01:06:45.406
It's basically, like, being a
human person all the time...

1385
01:06:45.439 --> 01:06:47.740
Please just leave me
here. Just leave me.

1386
01:06:47.774 --> 01:06:51.512
Go back to your messed-up world
and just leave me to mine.

1387
01:06:51.545 --> 01:06:53.913
- So, you're just gonna give up?
- Yes.

1388
01:06:58.785 --> 01:07:00.186
Okay.

1389
01:07:00.221 --> 01:07:01.864
You know, I almost
feel bad for you,

1390
01:07:01.888 --> 01:07:04.325
but you are exactly
what I thought you were.

1391
01:07:05.459 --> 01:07:06.493
Um...

1392
01:07:07.528 --> 01:07:09.496
Let's go, honey. Let's just...

1393
01:07:09.530 --> 01:07:10.940
Okay, how do we...
How do you expect...

1394
01:07:10.964 --> 01:07:12.333
Do everything we did in reverse.

1395
01:07:14.568 --> 01:07:18.239
Unbelievable. Come on, Mom.
She doesn't deserve you.

1396
01:07:23.310 --> 01:07:26.179
This is the lowest
I've ever been.

1397
01:07:26.213 --> 01:07:28.982
Emotionally and physically.

1398
01:07:30.551 --> 01:07:31.561
<i>Okay, kids,</i>

1399
01:07:31.585 --> 01:07:33.086
<i>it's time to run out</i>

1400
01:07:33.119 --> 01:07:34.555
<i>and get the new
Depression Barbie.</i>

1401
01:07:34.588 --> 01:07:36.490
<i>She wears sweatpants
all day and night.</i>

1402
01:07:36.523 --> 01:07:38.891
<i>She spent seven hours
today on Instagram,</i>

1403
01:07:38.925 --> 01:07:41.165
<i>looking at her estranged best
friend's engagement photos,</i>

1404
01:07:41.194 --> 01:07:43.364
<i>while eating a family-size
bag of Starbursts.</i>

1405
01:07:43.397 --> 01:07:45.366
<i>And now her jaw is killing her.</i>

1406
01:07:45.399 --> 01:07:48.302
<i>And she's going to watch the
BBC's</i> Pride and Prejudice

1407
01:07:48.335 --> 01:07:50.571
<i>for the seventh time

1408

1409
01:07:53.274 --> 01:07:56.042
<i>must be regarded as a highly
reprehensible connection.</i>

1410
01:07:56.075 --> 01:07:59.380
<i>Anxiety, panic attacks,
and OCD sold separately.</i>

1411
01:07:59.413 --> 01:08:02.449
Barbie. Barbie, wake up.

1412
01:08:02.483 --> 01:08:03.643
- Hey.
<i>- Weird.</i>

1413
01:08:04.951 --> 01:08:06.453
I'm like you now.

1414
01:08:06.487 --> 01:08:08.455
Ugly and unwanted.

1415
01:08:09.323 --> 01:08:10.357
Thanks.

1416
01:08:11.558 --> 01:08:13.026
Let's get her in
the back. Come on.

1417
01:08:13.059 --> 01:08:14.060
One, two...

1418
01:08:15.396 --> 01:08:16.406
- Isn't this great?
- Yes.

1419
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:18.097
Wait until you see the boat.

1420
01:08:18.131 --> 01:08:19.366
The boat.

1421
01:08:20.967 --> 01:08:22.536
Beautiful countryside.

1422
01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:29.543
<i>♪ I spent four years

1423
01:08:29.576 --> 01:08:33.614

Turn this song off,

1432
01:09:02.676 --> 01:09:04.378
- Who are you?
- I'm Allan.

1433
01:09:04.411 --> 01:09:06.246
Oh, you are Allan.
That's great.

1434
01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:08.147
Don't tell the Kens.
I'm trying to escape.

1435
01:09:08.181 --> 01:09:09.982
I cannot sit on one
more leather couch.

1436
01:09:10.016 --> 01:09:11.652
It's gonna break my spirit.

1437
01:09:11.685 --> 01:09:13.630
As soon as they figure out how
to build that wall sideways

1438
01:09:13.654 --> 01:09:15.255
and not just up,

1439
01:09:15.289 --> 01:09:17.558
no one is gonna be
able to get in or out.

1440
01:09:17.591 --> 01:09:19.436
So if we want to leave, we
better make a run for it.

1441
01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:22.095
No, Allan. You can't go. Having
a Barbie in the Real World

1442
01:09:22.128 --> 01:09:23.906
is what caused all these
problems in the first place.

1443
01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:26.170
Not one person would care if
Allan was in the Real World.

1444
01:09:29.570 --> 01:09:31.438
Yes, even him, so come on!

1445
01:09:31.472 --> 01:09:32.592
Hey, you there.

1446
01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:35.074
What do we do?

1447
01:09:35.108 --> 01:09:36.051
Just get in the car
and keep it singing.

1448
01:09:36.075 --> 01:09:37.176
- Hey, man.
- What?

1449
01:09:37.211 --> 01:09:38.911
Be ready for anything.

1450
01:09:38.945 --> 01:09:40.146
Who are you?

1451
01:09:40.179 --> 01:09:42.349
I'm Allan. I'm, uh,
I'm Ken's buddy.

1452
01:09:42.383 --> 01:09:44.050
Yeah, all of his clothes fit me.

1453
01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:48.222
Get in the car!

1454
01:09:52.024 --> 01:09:53.360
You want a piece?

1455
01:09:53.394 --> 01:09:54.604
Wait, you don't have
a driver's license.

1456
01:09:54.628 --> 01:09:55.672
This car doesn't have an engine.

1457
01:09:55.696 --> 01:09:56.563
Fine.

1458
01:10:00.967 --> 01:10:02.336
What are you
doing? We gotta go.

1459
01:10:02.369 --> 01:10:04.971
We have to go back.
Barbie Land needs saving.

1460
01:10:05.004 --> 01:10:06.473
Barbie needs saving.

1461
01:10:06.507 --> 01:10:08.342
What? You hate Barbie!

1462
01:10:08.375 --> 01:10:10.353
But you don't. You've always
believed in what she could be.

1463
01:10:10.377 --> 01:10:13.647
Yeah, well, I was wrong.
Barbie gave up. The Kens won.

1464
01:10:14.581 --> 01:10:16.115
You have to try.

1465
01:10:16.149 --> 01:10:17.660
Even if... Even if you
can't make it perfect,

1466
01:10:17.684 --> 01:10:20.119
- you can make it better.
- I can't make anything better.

1467
01:10:20.153 --> 01:10:21.555
I'm the one who
ruined Barbie Land

1468
01:10:21.588 --> 01:10:22.998
with my stupid drawings
in the first place.

1469
01:10:23.022 --> 01:10:24.591
They're not stupid!
They're amazing!

1470
01:10:27.227 --> 01:10:28.961
You like my drawings?

1471
01:10:28.995 --> 01:10:32.198
They're weird and
dark and crazy.

1472
01:10:32.232 --> 01:10:34.133
Everything you
pretend not to be.

1473
01:10:36.102 --> 01:10:39.473
I am, I am. I'm weird and
I'm dark and I'm crazy.

1474
01:10:42.175 --> 01:10:44.478
Easy. Easy.

1475
01:10:46.713 --> 01:10:49.316
Okay. You want some more Allan?

1476
01:10:51.552 --> 01:10:52.992
We have to get out
of here right now.

1477
01:10:53.019 --> 01:10:55.522
Shut up, Allan!
We're going back.

1478
01:10:55.556 --> 01:10:57.357
Let's go get my doll.

1479
01:11:01.228 --> 01:11:03.330
I'll never get out of here.

1480
01:11:03.363 --> 01:11:04.698
Where do we find Barbie?

1481
01:11:04.731 --> 01:11:06.291
There's only one place she'd be.

1482
01:11:08.335 --> 01:11:09.479
You're a writer.

1483
01:11:09.503 --> 01:11:11.371
This is your Nobel Prize.

1484
01:11:11.405 --> 01:11:12.606
- Remember winning it?
- Huh.

1485
01:11:12.639 --> 01:11:14.241
It's useless trying
to deprogram her.

1486
01:11:14.274 --> 01:11:15.776
I already did
everything I could.

1487
01:11:15.809 --> 01:11:18.779
Oh, my God. I don't even
know how I got here.

1488
01:11:18.812 --> 01:11:20.447
I don't deserve this.

1489
01:11:20.481 --> 01:11:23.217
Um, I'd like to thank Ken.

1490
01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:26.085
Thank you, Ken.

1491
01:11:26.118 --> 01:11:28.054
I love you, Ken.

1492
01:11:28.087 --> 01:11:29.523
The fork in my
soup is this, Barb.

1493
01:11:29.556 --> 01:11:32.493
Why didn't the
brainwashing work on you?

1494
01:11:32.526 --> 01:11:35.596
My exposure to the Real World
must have made me immune.

1495
01:11:35.629 --> 01:11:38.398
Either you're brainwashed,
or you're weird and ugly.

1496
01:11:38.432 --> 01:11:39.600
There is no in between.

1497
01:11:39.633 --> 01:11:41.067
Sing it, sister.

1498
01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:42.603
Well, get ready, kids.

1499
01:11:42.636 --> 01:11:44.481
Because in 48 hours, Barbie
Land becomes Ken Land.

1500
01:11:44.505 --> 01:11:46.072
Come on, gang.

1501
01:11:46.105 --> 01:11:47.350
We'll find Barbie at
the top of these stairs.

1502
01:11:47.374 --> 01:11:49.141
The Kens. They've found us.

1503
01:11:52.779 --> 01:11:54.348
- Ken!
- No! Get back.

1504
01:11:54.381 --> 01:11:56.061
Ken. Oh. Oh!

1505
01:11:58.785 --> 01:12:00.787
- Hello?
- Hmm?

1506
01:12:00.821 --> 01:12:03.089
- Humans. We're fine.
- Ah.

1507
01:12:03.122 --> 01:12:05.157
- And Allan.
- Hmm.

1508
01:12:05.191 --> 01:12:07.794
Come into my Weirdhouse.
Hi! I'm Weird Barbie.

1509
01:12:07.828 --> 01:12:09.596
I'm in the splits, I
have a funky haircut,

1510
01:12:09.630 --> 01:12:11.063
and I smell like basement.

1511
01:12:11.097 --> 01:12:13.567
Oh, my God. I had
a Weird Barbie.

1512
01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:16.703
- Yeah, you did.
- You make them weird by playing too hard.

1513
01:12:16.737 --> 01:12:18.505
That's cool.

1514
01:12:18.539 --> 01:12:20.450
That's Sugar Daddy Ken.
And Earring Magic Ken.

1515
01:12:20.474 --> 01:12:22.074
Mattel discontinued them.

1516
01:12:22.108 --> 01:12:23.277
- Sugar Daddy?
- No, no, no.

1517
01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:24.545
I'm not a sugar daddy.

1518
01:12:24.578 --> 01:12:27.179
This is Sugar,
and I'm her daddy.

1519
01:12:27.214 --> 01:12:29.483
And I have an earring.
A magic earring.

1520
01:12:29.516 --> 01:12:31.351
These were actual Kens.

1521
01:12:31.385 --> 01:12:33.820
More discontinued Barbies.

1522
01:12:33.854 --> 01:12:36.456
Growing Up Skipper? May I?

1523
01:12:36.490 --> 01:12:37.634
- Okay.
- Watch this.

1524
01:12:39.125 --> 01:12:41.428
- Her boobs grow.
- Why would they do that?

1525
01:12:41.461 --> 01:12:43.397
And Barbie Video Girl.

1526
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:46.533
I have a TV in my back. You
know whose dream that is?

1527
01:12:46.567 --> 01:12:48.802
Nobody. Nobody's dream.

1528
01:12:48.835 --> 01:12:50.737
And that's Barbie
Barbie, of course.

1529
01:12:50.771 --> 01:12:53.105
She's not dead. She's just
having an existential crisis.

1530
01:12:53.139 --> 01:12:54.541
Okay, come on.

1531
01:12:55.876 --> 01:12:57.076
Hey.

1532
01:12:57.878 --> 01:12:58.779
What's wrong?

1533
01:13:02.883 --> 01:13:06.620
I'm not pretty anymore.

1534
01:13:08.388 --> 01:13:10.223
What? You're so pretty.

1535
01:13:10.257 --> 01:13:13.760
I'm not Stereotypical
Barbie pretty.

1536
01:13:13.794 --> 01:13:15.462
<i>Note to the filmmakers.</i>

1537
01:13:15.495 --> 01:13:16.673
<i>Margot Robbie is the
wrong person to cast</i>

1538
01:13:16.697 --> 01:13:17.774
<i>if you want to make this point.</i>

1539
01:13:17.798 --> 01:13:20.267
But you're beautiful.

1540
01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:21.835
It's not just that. I'm not...

1541
01:13:23.737 --> 01:13:25.505
smart enough to be interesting.

1542
01:13:25.539 --> 01:13:27.708
You're so smart.

1543
01:13:27.741 --> 01:13:30.701
I can't do brain surgery,
I've never flown a plane.

1544
01:13:31.345 --> 01:13:32.579
I'm not the president.

1545
01:13:34.348 --> 01:13:36.383
No one on the
Supreme Court is me.

1546
01:13:38.452 --> 01:13:43.155
I'm not good enough
for anything.

1547
01:13:49.630 --> 01:13:52.566
It is literally
impossible to be a woman.

1548
01:13:54.368 --> 01:13:57.804
You are so beautiful
and so smart,

1549
01:13:57.838 --> 01:14:01.441
and it kills me that you don't
think you're good enough.

1550
01:14:01.475 --> 01:14:06.613
Like we have to always
be extraordinary.

1551
01:14:06.647 --> 01:14:10.651
But somehow, we're
always doing it wrong.

1552
01:14:13.654 --> 01:14:15.389
You have to be thin
but not too thin,

1553
01:14:15.422 --> 01:14:17.557
and you can never say
you want to be thin.

1554
01:14:17.591 --> 01:14:19.693
You have to say you
want to be healthy,

1555
01:14:19.726 --> 01:14:23.397
but also you have to be thin.

1556
01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:26.299
You have to have money,
but you can't ask for money

1557
01:14:26.333 --> 01:14:27.834
because that's crass.

1558
01:14:30.504 --> 01:14:32.439
You have to be a boss
but you can't be mean.

1559
01:14:32.472 --> 01:14:35.275
You have to lead, but you can't
squash other people's ideas.

1560
01:14:35.308 --> 01:14:36.786
You're supposed to
love being a mother,

1561
01:14:36.810 --> 01:14:38.979
but don't talk about your
kids all the damn time.

1562
01:14:39.012 --> 01:14:40.747
You have to be a career woman

1563
01:14:40.781 --> 01:14:44.217
but also always be looking
out for other people.

1564
01:14:44.251 --> 01:14:47.354
You have to answer for men's
bad behavior, which is insane,

1565
01:14:47.387 --> 01:14:50.323
but if you point that out,
you're accused of complaining.

1566
01:14:50.357 --> 01:14:52.793
You're supposed to stay pretty
for men but not so pretty

1567
01:14:52.826 --> 01:14:54.294
that you tempt them too much

1568
01:14:54.327 --> 01:14:55.829
or that you threaten other women

1569
01:14:55.862 --> 01:14:57.607
because you're supposed to
be a part of the sisterhood

1570
01:14:57.631 --> 01:14:59.399
but always stand out.

1571
01:14:59.433 --> 01:15:01.935
And always be grateful.

1572
01:15:01.968 --> 01:15:03.837
But never forget that
the system is rigged,

1573
01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:05.472
so find a way to
acknowledge that

1574
01:15:05.505 --> 01:15:07.541
but also always be grateful.

1575
01:15:07.574 --> 01:15:09.543
You have to never get old,

1576
01:15:09.576 --> 01:15:12.479
never be rude, never show off,

1577
01:15:12.512 --> 01:15:14.715
never be selfish,
never fall down,

1578
01:15:14.748 --> 01:15:16.717
never fail, never show fear,

1579
01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:18.618
never get out of line.

1580
01:15:18.652 --> 01:15:21.321
It's too hard, it's
too contradictory,

1581
01:15:21.363 --> 01:15:24.357
and nobody gives you a
medal or says thank you.

1582
01:15:24.391 --> 01:15:25.792
And it turns out, in fact,

1583
01:15:25.826 --> 01:15:27.003
that not only are you
doing everything wrong

1584
01:15:27.027 --> 01:15:29.596
but also everything
is your fault.

1585
01:15:34.668 --> 01:15:38.338
I'm just so tired
of watching myself

1586
01:15:38.371 --> 01:15:42.501
and every single other woman

1587
01:15:42.526 --> 01:15:47.260
tie herself into knots so
that people will like us.

1588
01:15:50.138 --> 01:15:52.007
And if all of that

1589
01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:55.951
is also true for a doll

1590
01:15:57.196 --> 01:16:01.200
just representing a woman...

1591
01:16:03.758 --> 01:16:06.471
then I don't even know.

1592
01:16:12.405 --> 01:16:13.306
Wait.

1593
01:16:14.650 --> 01:16:16.852
I did write a book.

1594
01:16:16.877 --> 01:16:18.945
It's like I've been in a dream,

1595
01:16:18.979 --> 01:16:22.130
where I was somehow
really invested

1596
01:16:22.155 --> 01:16:24.958
in the Zack Snyder
cut of <i>Justice League.</i>

1597
01:16:26.686 --> 01:16:29.776
But what you said
broke me out of it.

1598
01:16:30.730 --> 01:16:31.664
Really?

1599
01:16:31.689 --> 01:16:32.790
Yeah.

1600
01:16:32.815 --> 01:16:34.594
You're back. She's back.

1601
01:16:34.628 --> 01:16:36.863
By giving voice to the
cognitive dissonance required

1602
01:16:36.897 --> 01:16:38.565
to be a woman under
the patriarchy,

1603
01:16:38.598 --> 01:16:41.026
- you robbed it of its power.
- Yes.

1604
01:16:42.369 --> 01:16:44.024
Wow, I just said all of that.

1605
01:16:44.049 --> 01:16:46.470
Hell, yes, White Savior Barbie!

1606
01:16:46.495 --> 01:16:49.618
No, it was your mom.
Your mom did the saving.

1607
01:16:49.643 --> 01:16:51.678
We have to stop the Kens.

1608
01:16:51.711 --> 01:16:53.956
And you need to say all of those
things to the other Barbies.

1609
01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:55.545
- That's the key.
- Got it.

1610
01:16:55.570 --> 01:16:56.814
But how are we gonna
get the Barbies

1611
01:16:56.839 --> 01:16:58.268
away from their Kens?

1612
01:16:58.293 --> 01:16:59.962
We have experience with
a world like this one.

1613
01:16:59.987 --> 01:17:01.573
Do you have a map
of Barbie Land?

1614
01:17:01.829 --> 01:17:03.706
What do you think?

1615
01:17:06.332 --> 01:17:08.001
- Wow.
- Thanks. I built it.

1616
01:17:08.026 --> 01:17:09.062
Okay, here's the deal.

1617
01:17:09.095 --> 01:17:11.059
It's not just about
how they see us,

1618
01:17:11.084 --> 01:17:12.853
it's about how they
see themselves.

1619
01:17:12.878 --> 01:17:15.649
Ken Land contains the seeds
of its own destruction.

1620
01:17:15.674 --> 01:17:18.505
First we have to get the
Barbies away from their Kens.

1621
01:17:18.538 --> 01:17:21.898
We could use a decoy Barbie
who pretends to be brainwashed.

1622
01:17:21.923 --> 01:17:23.157
- That should be you.
- Cool.

1623
01:17:30.016 --> 01:17:32.619
<i>Distract them by appearing
helpless and confused.</i>

1624
01:17:32.652 --> 01:17:34.888
<i>Kens cannot resist a
damsel in distress.</i>

1625
01:17:34.921 --> 01:17:37.500
<i>You have to make them believe
that you're complacent.</i>

1626
01:17:37.524 --> 01:17:39.276
<i>That they have the power.</i>

1627
01:17:39.301 --> 01:17:42.378
<i>And when their guard is down,
you take the power back.</i>

1628
01:17:45.118 --> 01:17:47.187
The influence that Porsche 356

1629
01:17:47.212 --> 01:17:49.314
has had on the motoring
world as a whole,

1630
01:17:49.339 --> 01:17:50.665
it can't be overstated.

1631
01:17:50.690 --> 01:17:52.915
Oh! Photoshop is so hard!

1632
01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:55.196
I just don't understand
how to use the Select tool.

1633
01:17:55.221 --> 01:17:57.118
Honey, you can only
use the Select tool

1634
01:17:57.143 --> 01:17:58.511
if the layer is highlighted.

1635
01:17:58.545 --> 01:17:59.579
Let me show you.

1636
01:17:59.613 --> 01:18:00.981
My tiny head is just swimming

1637
01:18:01.014 --> 01:18:02.949
with technical jargon
like color bands...

1638
01:18:02.983 --> 01:18:05.785
- Oh! Hi.
- And magnetic lassos and bit maps.

1639
01:18:05.819 --> 01:18:07.799
Do you think that you and your
strong arms can explain...

1640
01:18:07.824 --> 01:18:10.028
- Oh! What's happening?
- Allan, go around!

1641
01:18:10.056 --> 01:18:10.991
Ahh!

1642
01:18:12.459 --> 01:18:13.836
- Oh, but what about Ken?
- No, no, no!

1643
01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:16.630
- No, but I love him!
- Come on, Allan!

1644
01:18:16.663 --> 01:18:19.032
Hey! What's gonna
happen to Ken?

1645
01:18:19.065 --> 01:18:20.567
Just listen.

1646
01:18:20.753 --> 01:18:21.902
You have to be their mommies

1647
01:18:21.935 --> 01:18:23.603
but not remind them
of their mommy.

1648
01:18:23.637 --> 01:18:26.026
Any power you have must
be masked under a giggle.

1649
01:18:28.508 --> 01:18:29.509
What happened?

1650
01:18:29.542 --> 01:18:30.977
One minute I was president,

1651
01:18:31.011 --> 01:18:34.329
and the next I was cutting
a Ken steak for him.

1652
01:18:34.354 --> 01:18:35.916
Welcome back, Madam President.

1653
01:18:35.949 --> 01:18:39.821
Then we'll recruit the now
unbrainwashed Barbies to our cause.

1654
01:18:39.846 --> 01:18:41.688
<i>They can be the new decoys.</i>

1655
01:18:41.721 --> 01:18:43.666
<i>You can tell him that you've
never seen</i> The Godfather.

1656
01:18:43.690 --> 01:18:46.192
<i>And that you'd love them
to explain it to you.</i>

1657
01:18:46.227 --> 01:18:49.048
Ooh, are you guys
watching <i>The Godfather?</i>

1658
01:18:49.073 --> 01:18:50.274
<i>The Godfather.</i>

1659
01:18:50.299 --> 01:18:51.674
I've never seen it.

1660
01:18:51.699 --> 01:18:53.549
Oh, my God. You've never
seen <i>The Godfather?</i>

1661
01:18:53.574 --> 01:18:55.911
This movie is a rich blend
of Coppola's aesthetic genius

1662
01:18:55.936 --> 01:18:57.570
and a triumph for Robert Evans

1663
01:18:57.604 --> 01:18:59.259
and the architecture of
the '70s studio system.

1664
01:18:59.284 --> 01:19:00.549
Can you start the movie over

1665
01:19:00.573 --> 01:19:01.951
and just talk through
the whole thing?

1666
01:19:01.975 --> 01:19:03.993
You have to find a way
to reject men's advances

1667
01:19:04.018 --> 01:19:05.545
without damaging their egos.

1668
01:19:05.578 --> 01:19:06.956
Because if you say yes
to them, you're a tramp,

1669
01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:08.971
but if you say no to
them, you're a prude.

1670
01:19:10.865 --> 01:19:12.267
I don't wanna touch a foot.

1671
01:19:12.292 --> 01:19:13.486
No, you don't.

1672
01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:15.993
Another one, be
confused about money.

1673
01:19:16.018 --> 01:19:18.495
I just have all my money
in a savings account.

1674
01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:20.197
That's totally wrong.
You need treasury bonds,

1675
01:19:20.222 --> 01:19:21.423
corporate bonds, CDs.

1676
01:19:21.448 --> 01:19:22.963
No one has CDs anymore.

1677
01:19:22.996 --> 01:19:25.765
Oh, sweetheart, you are so
cute when you're confused.

1678
01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:27.600
But no, not music.

1679
01:19:27.634 --> 01:19:30.003
CD stands for
Certificate of Deposit.

1680
01:19:30.036 --> 01:19:32.639
Stephen Malkmus really harnessed
the acerbic talk-singing

1681
01:19:32.672 --> 01:19:34.407
of Lou Reed with
post-punk influences

1682
01:19:34.432 --> 01:19:36.360
such as Wire and The Fall.

1683
01:19:36.385 --> 01:19:38.111
What am I wearing? I
would never choose this.

1684
01:19:38.144 --> 01:19:40.714
Because you're a physicist.
Do you want some pants?

1685
01:19:40.747 --> 01:19:41.781
Yeah.

1686
01:19:43.854 --> 01:19:45.051
Welcome back, Barbie.

1687
01:19:45.085 --> 01:19:48.054
Gee, I am so awkward and
don't feel pretty at all,

1688
01:19:48.088 --> 01:19:49.990
and will anyone ever like me?

1689
01:19:50.023 --> 01:19:51.909
<i>Or distract them
with the old standby.</i>

1690
01:19:51.934 --> 01:19:54.078
<i>Wearing glasses so they can
discover that you're pretty.</i>

1691
01:19:54.103 --> 01:19:55.939
- May I?
- Sure. Go ahead.

1692
01:20:00.267 --> 01:20:03.557
There. Now we can see
your beautiful face.

1693
01:20:04.401 --> 01:20:06.595
And then there's
pretending to be terrible

1694
01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:08.266
at every sport ever.

1695
01:20:08.291 --> 01:20:10.135
Here, let me show you.

1696
01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:12.071
Here, let me show you.

1697
01:20:12.096 --> 01:20:14.298
- Here, let me show you.
- Here, let me show you.

1698
01:20:14.323 --> 01:20:16.217
Here, let us show you.

1699
01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:18.651
We'll do this until
every single Barbie

1700
01:20:18.685 --> 01:20:21.551
is deprogrammed and ready
to take back Barbie Land.

1701
01:20:21.576 --> 01:20:22.611
- Yes!
- Yes!

1702
01:20:22.636 --> 01:20:24.037
Yeah!

1703
01:20:28.061 --> 01:20:32.632
Hey! Tomorrow the Kens vote
to change the Constitution,

1704
01:20:32.665 --> 01:20:34.189
so we have to get there first.

1705
01:20:34.214 --> 01:20:35.970
The final stage of our plan,

1706
01:20:35.995 --> 01:20:38.048
to turn the Kens
against each other.

1707
01:20:38.073 --> 01:20:40.399
Now that they think they
have power over you,

1708
01:20:40.424 --> 01:20:42.609
you make them question
whether they have enough power

1709
01:20:42.642 --> 01:20:44.010
over each other.

1710
01:20:44.044 --> 01:20:46.247
What if this doesn't work?

1711
01:20:46.467 --> 01:20:47.834
What if he doesn't...

1712
01:20:49.399 --> 01:20:51.003
like me anymore?

1713
01:20:52.133 --> 01:20:55.323
- He likes you.
- He was really upset.

1714
01:20:56.122 --> 01:20:57.991
Because he likes you.

1715
01:20:58.024 --> 01:20:59.759
And because he knows deep down

1716
01:20:59.793 --> 01:21:01.895
that you don't like
him the same way.

1717
01:21:01.928 --> 01:21:03.815
It still doesn't mean
I want to hurt him.

1718
01:21:05.031 --> 01:21:06.900
He took your house.

1719
01:21:06.933 --> 01:21:08.202
He brainwashed your friends.

1720
01:21:08.235 --> 01:21:10.298
He wants to control
the government.

1721
01:21:10.323 --> 01:21:11.704
True.

1722
01:21:11.738 --> 01:21:13.907
- Girl.
- Yeah.

1723
01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:15.742
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1724
01:21:15.775 --> 01:21:18.353
It's like I'm a woman already.

1725
01:21:18.378 --> 01:21:19.746
Welcome.

1726
01:21:19.779 --> 01:21:21.181
Is this what it's like?

1727
01:21:22.409 --> 01:21:23.665
It's time.

1728
01:21:23.690 --> 01:21:24.858
I'm ready.

1729
01:21:25.596 --> 01:21:26.796
Thank you.

1730
01:21:27.582 --> 01:21:28.516
Here I go.

1731
01:21:35.387 --> 01:21:36.534
Hi.

1732
01:21:40.368 --> 01:21:41.339
Ahh!

1733
01:21:46.556 --> 01:21:49.157
Oh, hey. You've
caught me reading.

1734
01:21:49.182 --> 01:21:50.844
Oh.

1735
01:21:50.877 --> 01:21:52.178
- I've been thinking.
- Mm-hmm.

1736
01:21:52.213 --> 01:21:54.180
- Ken Land.
- Kendom.

1737
01:21:54.215 --> 01:21:55.815
- Kendom.
- Kendom Land.

1738
01:21:55.849 --> 01:21:57.309
- Land of the...
- Land of the free and the men.

1739
01:21:57.334 --> 01:21:59.090
Right. Well, this place is...

1740
01:21:59.115 --> 01:22:00.221
Kendom Land.

1741
01:22:00.254 --> 01:22:01.821
Really great.

1742
01:22:01.855 --> 01:22:04.536
And the Kens really are
just better at ruling

1743
01:22:04.561 --> 01:22:06.159
than the Barbies ever were.

1744
01:22:06.192 --> 01:22:09.067
Well, we just took patriarchy
and you know, made a patriarchy.

1745
01:22:09.092 --> 01:22:11.270
- Yeah, well, I was thinking...
- Yes?

1746
01:22:11.295 --> 01:22:15.067
I'm ready to be your
long-term-distance

1747
01:22:15.092 --> 01:22:17.300
low-commitment
casual girlfriend,

1748
01:22:17.341 --> 01:22:19.147
if you'll still have me.

1749
01:22:20.335 --> 01:22:21.811
Would you just hold
on for one second?

1750
01:22:21.836 --> 01:22:22.871
Oh, okay.

1751
01:22:28.493 --> 01:22:29.717
Sublime!

1752
01:22:33.682 --> 01:22:35.851
I don't know. I'm gonna
have to think about that.

1753
01:22:35.876 --> 01:22:36.743
Oh.

1754
01:22:38.251 --> 01:22:39.119
Please?

1755
01:22:41.861 --> 01:22:43.196
Okay.

1756
01:22:43.230 --> 01:22:45.451
Come on in. I'll play
the guitar at you.

1757
01:22:45.476 --> 01:22:46.889

01:25:15.419 --> 01:25:17.622
low-commitment
girlfriend mean nothing?

1804
01:25:17.647 --> 01:25:18.787
What do we do?

1805
01:25:18.812 --> 01:25:21.627
We beach every individual
one of them off.

1806
01:25:21.652 --> 01:25:22.553
No.

1807
01:25:23.570 --> 01:25:24.983
We go to war.

1808
01:25:25.892 --> 01:25:27.803
- Against the Barbies?
- No, against the Kens.

1809
01:25:27.828 --> 01:25:29.372
- But we are the Kens.
- The other Kens.

1810
01:25:29.397 --> 01:25:30.872
We should probably call
them something else

1811
01:25:30.897 --> 01:25:31.998
so it doesn't get confusing.

1812
01:25:32.031 --> 01:25:33.243
No, because we'll
know what we mean.

1813
01:25:33.267 --> 01:25:34.264
But when we're on
the battlefield

1814
01:25:34.289 --> 01:25:35.428
and you say "Ken
at four o'clock,"

1815
01:25:35.453 --> 01:25:37.076
how will I know if you mean
us Kens or the other Kens?

1816
01:25:37.101 --> 01:25:39.536
Because, my dudes, we
attack at ten o'clock

1817
01:25:39.561 --> 01:25:41.778
and take advantage
of the morning waves.

1818
01:25:41.803 --> 01:25:44.668
But not so early 'cause
we're gonna want to sleep in.

1819
01:25:44.693 --> 01:25:45.545
Right.

1820
01:25:45.570 --> 01:25:47.122
But what will we fight
with? We have no guns.

1821
01:25:47.146 --> 01:25:49.411
Tennis rackets and volleyballs.

1822
01:25:49.436 --> 01:25:50.950
And slap fights.

1823
01:25:50.983 --> 01:25:52.205
And beach offs.

1824
01:25:52.230 --> 01:25:54.132

1886
01:30:58.003 --> 01:31:00.023
- Ken! Ken.
- Huh? Yeah?

1887
01:31:00.048 --> 01:31:01.649
Weren't we supposed
to vote today?

1888
01:31:01.674 --> 01:31:03.563
- What?
- To change the Constitution.

1889
01:31:03.597 --> 01:31:06.354
- Oh, it was today, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

1890
01:31:11.362 --> 01:31:13.806
Okay, ladies, let's do this.

1891
01:31:13.831 --> 01:31:17.368
All those in favor of letting
Barbie Land be Barbie Land,

1892
01:31:17.393 --> 01:31:18.578
say "Aye."

1893
01:31:18.612 --> 01:31:19.813
Aye!

1894
01:31:34.033 --> 01:31:35.580
I'm so happy.

1895
01:31:35.605 --> 01:31:38.874
Go, Barbie! Go, Barbie!
Go, Barbie! Go, Barbie!

1896
01:31:38.899 --> 01:31:42.703
Go, Barbie! Go, Barbie!
Go, Barbie! Go, Barbie!

1897
01:31:54.566 --> 01:31:56.134
Is it just my imagination,

1898
01:31:56.159 --> 01:32:01.029
or did these Mojo Dojo Casa
Houses just get dreamier?

1899
01:32:01.054 --> 01:32:04.032
That's because they're
Dreamhouses, mother...

1900
01:32:04.057 --> 01:32:05.323
That's right.

1901
01:32:05.348 --> 01:32:07.402
We've reinstated the
Barbie Land Constitution

1902
01:32:07.427 --> 01:32:08.823
to what it should be.

1903
01:32:08.848 --> 01:32:11.991
And restored all the
Barbies' brains and autonomy.

1904
01:32:12.016 --> 01:32:13.056
Yes!

1905
01:32:15.569 --> 01:32:18.305
And we seriously
disinfected those houses.

1906
01:32:18.338 --> 01:32:19.339
What do we do?

1907
01:32:21.603 --> 01:32:22.771
Kens!

1908
01:32:24.511 --> 01:32:26.613
- Who are we attacking, sir?
- No...

1909
01:32:28.899 --> 01:32:29.933
No...

1910
01:32:33.632 --> 01:32:35.467
Don't look at me!

1911
01:32:36.102 --> 01:32:37.937
Is he crying?

1912
01:32:37.962 --> 01:32:39.697
Just give us a minute.

1913
01:32:45.677 --> 01:32:46.869
Ken.

1914
01:32:49.294 --> 01:32:50.696
Are you okay?

1915
01:32:50.721 --> 01:32:52.267
Yeah. Totally.

1916
01:32:52.292 --> 01:32:53.970
It's okay if you're crying.

1917
01:32:53.995 --> 01:32:56.343
You know, I cried too. It's
actually kind of amazing.

1918
01:32:56.376 --> 01:32:58.955
I'm a liberated man. I
know crying is not weak.

1919
01:32:58.980 --> 01:33:00.753
Okay.

1920
01:33:02.711 --> 01:33:03.911
You wanna sit up for a minute?

1921
01:33:09.170 --> 01:33:11.138
This, uh...

1922
01:33:11.202 --> 01:33:13.037
It was hard running stuff.

1923
01:33:14.062 --> 01:33:15.998
I didn't love it.

1924
01:33:16.950 --> 01:33:18.284
I get it.

1925
01:33:22.602 --> 01:33:24.837
And those mini-fridges
are so small.

1926
01:33:24.862 --> 01:33:26.704
- Mm-hmm.
- You could only fit a six pack in them.

1927
01:33:26.729 --> 01:33:29.876
And the freezers are
basically useless.

1928
01:33:31.745 --> 01:33:33.628
To be honest, when I found out

1929
01:33:33.653 --> 01:33:35.088
that patriarchy
wasn't about horses,

1930
01:33:35.113 --> 01:33:37.057
I lost interest anyway.

1931
01:33:37.995 --> 01:33:39.346
That's okay.

1932
01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:47.236
I always thought this
would be our house.

1933
01:33:50.137 --> 01:33:51.271
Oh.

1934
01:33:54.374 --> 01:33:55.534
Ken.

1935
01:33:57.510 --> 01:34:00.397
- I think I owe you an apology.
- Huh?

1936
01:34:00.422 --> 01:34:02.475
I'm really sorry I
took you for granted.

1937
01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:04.096
Oh.

1938
01:34:04.958 --> 01:34:07.671
Not every night had
to be girls' night.

1939
01:34:10.705 --> 01:34:12.709
Thank you for saying that.

1940
01:34:13.974 --> 01:34:15.444
Thank you.

1941
01:34:16.949 --> 01:34:20.386
Oh. I didn't mean
to suggest, uh...

1942
01:34:20.411 --> 01:34:22.980
I just don't know
who I am without you.

1943
01:34:24.362 --> 01:34:25.997
You're Ken.

1944
01:34:26.982 --> 01:34:30.052
But it's "Barbie and Ken."

1945
01:34:31.586 --> 01:34:34.522
There is no just "Ken."

1946
01:34:35.108 --> 01:34:37.043
That's why I was created.

1947
01:34:37.561 --> 01:34:39.229
I only exist

1948
01:34:40.777 --> 01:34:42.858
within the warmth of your gaze.

1949
01:34:44.001 --> 01:34:45.596
Without it,

1950
01:34:46.314 --> 01:34:50.118
I'm just another blond
guy who can't do flips.

1951
01:34:59.252 --> 01:35:04.437
Maybe it's time to
discover who Ken is.

1952
01:35:04.471 --> 01:35:06.773
- Okay. I think I get it now.
- Okay.

1953
01:35:06.806 --> 01:35:10.176
No, no, no! This
isn't the answer.

1954
01:35:12.746 --> 01:35:14.014
I feel so stupid.

1955
01:35:14.047 --> 01:35:15.508
- No.
- No.

1956
01:35:15.533 --> 01:35:17.869
- I look so stupid.
- Yeah.

1957
01:35:17.894 --> 01:35:20.430
I look so stupid!

1958
01:35:20.455 --> 01:35:23.798
- No!
- So cool. You look so cool.

1959
01:35:23.823 --> 01:35:26.192
Okay. Ken, you
have to figure out

1960
01:35:26.227 --> 01:35:28.406
who you are without me.

1961
01:35:29.833 --> 01:35:30.873
Why?

1962
01:35:30.898 --> 01:35:32.666
You're not your girlfriend.

1963
01:35:32.699 --> 01:35:35.568
You're not your house,
you're not your mink.

1964
01:35:35.594 --> 01:35:37.537
- Beach?
- Nope.

1965
01:35:37.570 --> 01:35:39.572
You're not even beach.

1966
01:35:39.606 --> 01:35:43.677
Maybe all the things that
you thought made you you

1967
01:35:43.710 --> 01:35:48.211
aren't... really you.

1968
01:35:52.519 --> 01:35:55.305
Maybe it's Barbie and...

1969
01:35:57.091 --> 01:35:58.692
it's Ken.

1970
01:36:02.006 --> 01:36:05.180
Ken is...

1971
01:36:07.066 --> 01:36:07.967
me?

1972
01:36:07.992 --> 01:36:08.999
Yes.

1973
01:36:09.024 --> 01:36:11.827
Ken is me!

1974
01:36:12.984 --> 01:36:14.719
And I'm Barbie.

1975
01:36:17.572 --> 01:36:19.040
Ken...

1976
01:36:20.583 --> 01:36:21.584
is me!

1977
01:36:21.609 --> 01:36:22.515
Ken is me!

1978
01:36:22.549 --> 01:36:23.883
- Ken is me!
- Ken is me!

1979
01:36:24.812 --> 01:36:26.413
I don't even care about
being Ken anymore.

1980
01:36:26.437 --> 01:36:27.563
I just miss my friend Barbie!

1981
01:36:27.587 --> 01:36:29.122
- That's cool!
- Barbie!

1982
01:36:29.155 --> 01:36:30.857
I'm right here.

1983
01:36:30.944 --> 01:36:31.945
Ken!

1984
01:36:36.469 --> 01:36:38.865
I want you to have it.

1985
01:36:38.898 --> 01:36:41.235
Aw. That's nice.

1986
01:36:48.716 --> 01:36:51.719
We were only fighting because
we didn't know who we were.

1987
01:36:53.646 --> 01:36:59.656
Ken is me!

1988
01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:08.595
Ken is right.

1989
01:37:08.628 --> 01:37:11.350
It's just so hard
to be a leader.

1990
01:37:11.375 --> 01:37:13.178
- You know?
- That's my boss.

1991
01:37:13.203 --> 01:37:15.236
It's... Oh.

1992
01:37:15.269 --> 01:37:17.483
Midge, gosh.

1993
01:37:17.508 --> 01:37:19.039
I thought we discontinued her.

1994
01:37:21.174 --> 01:37:24.069
Look, do you know how many times

1995
01:37:24.094 --> 01:37:27.451
I've wanted to stand up in a
board meeting and just say,

1996
01:37:27.476 --> 01:37:29.250
"Can we just
tickle each other?"

1997
01:37:29.283 --> 01:37:30.984
- Really?
- Let's have a company retreat

1998
01:37:31.017 --> 01:37:32.762
and just tickle each other.

1999
01:37:32.786 --> 01:37:34.888
Someone get me. Someone get me.

2000
01:37:36.234 --> 01:37:38.225
I love being tickled.

2001
01:37:38.259 --> 01:37:41.295
No, no, no. Don't
hug me. Don't hug me.

2002
01:37:44.097 --> 01:37:46.132
But thanks to the Barbies,

2003
01:37:46.166 --> 01:37:49.669
I, too, can now relieve myself
of this heavy existential burden

2004
01:37:49.694 --> 01:37:53.706
while holding on to the
very real title of CEO.

2005
01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:56.210
And we can restore
everything in Barbie Land

2006
01:37:56.235 --> 01:37:57.977
to exactly the way it was.

2007
01:37:58.011 --> 01:38:01.681
- Mister Mattel, I just...
- Please. Call me Mother.

2008
01:38:01.714 --> 01:38:03.049
No, thank you.

2009
01:38:03.083 --> 01:38:04.851
I don't think that
things should go back

2010
01:38:04.884 --> 01:38:06.353
to the way that they were.

2011
01:38:06.387 --> 01:38:10.265
No Barbie or Ken should
be living in the shadows.

2012
01:38:10.574 --> 01:38:11.877
Or Allan.

2013
01:38:12.259 --> 01:38:13.660
- Hey.
- Me?

2014
01:38:13.693 --> 01:38:15.623
- Yeah.
- Oh. Hello.

2015
01:38:15.648 --> 01:38:16.796
I just want to say,

2016
01:38:16.830 --> 01:38:18.107
I'm sorry we called
you Weird Barbie

2017
01:38:18.131 --> 01:38:19.766
behind your back and
also to your face.

2018
01:38:19.799 --> 01:38:22.284
That's okay. I'm owning it.

2019
01:38:22.309 --> 01:38:24.374
Would you like a
job in my cabinet?

2020
01:38:24.453 --> 01:38:26.383
May I please have sanitation?

2021
01:38:27.245 --> 01:38:28.539
It's yours.

2022
01:38:28.594 --> 01:38:30.287
- Yeah, thank you.
- All right.

2023
01:38:30.311 --> 01:38:32.011
- Madam President.
- Oh.

2024
01:38:32.045 --> 01:38:34.981
Please, may the Kens have
one Supreme Court Justice?

2025
01:38:35.014 --> 01:38:39.327
Oh, I can't do that. But maybe
a lower circuit court judgeship.

2026
01:38:39.352 --> 01:38:41.287
We accept. As long
as we can wear robes.

2027
01:38:41.312 --> 01:38:43.553
<i>Well, the Kens have
to start somewhere.</i>

2028
01:38:43.578 --> 01:38:45.365
<i>And one day, the Kens will have</i>

2029
01:38:45.390 --> 01:38:48.045
<i>as much power and
influence in Barbie Land</i>

2030
01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:50.697
<i>as women have in the Real World.</i>

2031
01:38:50.730 --> 01:38:52.026
No, I don't want to.

2032
01:38:52.051 --> 01:38:53.319
- Just go!
- I can't.

2033
01:38:53.344 --> 01:38:56.169
- Grow up and go.
- I have an idea.

2034
01:38:56.324 --> 01:38:58.100
Tell me your secret
dream, child.

2035
01:38:58.125 --> 01:39:01.308
Okay, what about
Ordinary Barbie?

2036
01:39:01.342 --> 01:39:04.547
She's not extraordinary. She's
not president of anything,

2037
01:39:04.572 --> 01:39:05.745
or maybe she is.

2038
01:39:05.778 --> 01:39:07.914
Maybe she's a mom.
Maybe she's not.

2039
01:39:07.939 --> 01:39:11.017
Because it's okay to
just want to be a mom,

2040
01:39:11.050 --> 01:39:13.320
or to wanna be president
or a mom who is president.

2041
01:39:13.354 --> 01:39:15.445
Or not a mom who's
also not president.

2042
01:39:15.470 --> 01:39:17.258
She just has a flattering top,

2043
01:39:17.291 --> 01:39:18.948
and she wants to
get through the day

2044
01:39:18.973 --> 01:39:21.510
feeling kinda good
about herself.

2045
01:39:23.763 --> 01:39:25.999
That's a terrible idea.

2046
01:39:26.032 --> 01:39:27.401
Yeah, that's going
to make money.

2047
01:39:27.434 --> 01:39:31.137
Oh. Ordinary Barbie.
I love it. Fantastic.

2048
01:39:31.171 --> 01:39:32.703
Okay, great.

2049
01:39:32.728 --> 01:39:33.915
- Great.
- Cool.

2050
01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:35.141
- Yes.
- We good?

2051
01:39:35.175 --> 01:39:36.503
I think we're good, right?

2052
01:39:36.528 --> 01:39:38.430
All right, let's begin the work

2053
01:39:38.455 --> 01:39:41.147
to close the portal
between our two worlds.

2054
01:39:41.181 --> 01:39:43.461
Hey, what about Barbie?

2055
01:39:43.486 --> 01:39:44.418
What do you mean?

2056
01:39:44.451 --> 01:39:46.156
Yeah, what about Barbie?

2057
01:39:46.181 --> 01:39:50.131
What's her ending?
What does she get?

2058
01:39:50.156 --> 01:39:53.172
Well, that's easy.
She's in love with Ken.

2059
01:39:53.197 --> 01:39:55.720
- Aw.
- That is not her ending.

2060
01:39:57.764 --> 01:39:59.752
- I'm not in love with Ken.
- Oh.

2061
01:40:00.011 --> 01:40:01.197
What do you want?

2062
01:40:02.970 --> 01:40:04.666
I don't know. I'm...

2063
01:40:06.552 --> 01:40:09.455
I'm not really sure
where I belong anymore.

2064
01:40:14.047 --> 01:40:15.915
I don't think I have an ending.

2065
01:40:15.949 --> 01:40:18.273
That was always the point.

2066
01:40:18.298 --> 01:40:21.468
I created you so you
wouldn't have an ending.

2067
01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:24.228
It's you.

2068
01:40:26.393 --> 01:40:28.283
You're Ruth from Mattel.

2069
01:40:28.775 --> 01:40:31.030
Baby, I am Mattel.

2070
01:40:31.064 --> 01:40:34.211
Until the IRS got to me,
but that's another movie.

2071
01:40:34.236 --> 01:40:35.269
So, you're...

2072
01:40:35.302 --> 01:40:38.339
Ruth Handler.
Inventor of Barbie.

2073
01:40:38.372 --> 01:40:39.515
What?

2074
01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:41.074
That's so cool.

2075
01:40:41.107 --> 01:40:43.277
Her ghost keeps an
office on the 17th floor.

2076
01:40:43.310 --> 01:40:44.391
- What?
- What?

2077
01:40:44.416 --> 01:40:45.806
You guys,

2078
01:40:45.831 --> 01:40:48.982
you think the lady who invented
Barbie looks like Barbie?

2079
01:40:49.015 --> 01:40:51.150
I'm a five-foot-nothing grandma

2080
01:40:51.184 --> 01:40:52.852
with a double mastectomy...

2081
01:40:52.885 --> 01:40:55.021
and tax evasion issues.

2082
01:40:55.054 --> 01:40:57.491
Nobody looks like Barbie,

2083
01:40:57.524 --> 01:41:01.060
except, of course,
Barbie. Take a bow, honey.

2084
01:41:03.332 --> 01:41:06.101
I don't really feel
like Barbie anymore.

2085
01:41:10.237 --> 01:41:12.072
Come, walk with me.

2086
01:41:32.098 --> 01:41:33.132
Thank you.

2087
01:41:35.079 --> 01:41:36.247
Thank you, Barbie.

2088
01:41:38.436 --> 01:41:39.525
Thank you.

2089
01:41:49.175 --> 01:41:51.177
I'm not really sure what
I'm supposed to do now.

2090
01:41:51.211 --> 01:41:53.880
I've always been
Stereotypical Barbie,

2091
01:41:53.913 --> 01:41:57.217
and I don't think I'm really
good at anything else.

2092
01:41:57.251 --> 01:41:59.420
You saved Barbie
Land from patriarchy.

2093
01:41:59.453 --> 01:42:02.222
That was very much
a group effort.

2094
01:42:02.256 --> 01:42:05.191
And you helped that mother
and daughter connect.

2095
01:42:05.357 --> 01:42:07.205
They really helped each other.

2096
01:42:08.352 --> 01:42:11.002
Maybe you're
Self-Effacing Barbie?

2097
01:42:12.686 --> 01:42:14.611
Maybe I'm not Barbie anymore.

2098
01:42:23.644 --> 01:42:27.481
You understand that humans
only have one ending.

2099
01:42:27.514 --> 01:42:31.918
Ideas live forever,
humans not so much.

2100
01:42:31.951 --> 01:42:33.287
You know that, right?

2101
01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:34.681
I do.

2102
01:42:34.706 --> 01:42:37.424
Being a human can be
pretty uncomfortable.

2103
01:42:39.013 --> 01:42:40.402
I know.

2104
01:42:40.427 --> 01:42:44.748
Humans make things up
like patriarchy and Barbie

2105
01:42:44.773 --> 01:42:47.543
just to deal with how
uncomfortable it is.

2106
01:42:48.167 --> 01:42:49.969
I understand that.

2107
01:42:50.002 --> 01:42:51.492
And then you die.

2108
01:42:53.556 --> 01:42:54.619
Yeah.

2109
01:42:56.537 --> 01:42:57.572
Yeah.

2110
01:43:04.493 --> 01:43:08.631
I want to be a
part of the people

2111
01:43:08.656 --> 01:43:10.458
that make meaning.

2112
01:43:12.001 --> 01:43:13.937
Not the thing that's made.

2113
01:43:16.296 --> 01:43:19.524
I want to do the imagining.
I don't wanna be the idea.

2114
01:43:19.549 --> 01:43:21.402
Does that make sense?

2115
01:43:21.435 --> 01:43:23.969
I always knew that
Barbie would surprise me,

2116
01:43:23.994 --> 01:43:26.640
but I never expected this.

2117
01:43:26.665 --> 01:43:31.211
Do you give me permission
to become human?

2118
01:43:31.245 --> 01:43:33.492
You don't need my permission.

2119
01:43:33.517 --> 01:43:37.083
But you're the creator.
You... Don't you control me?

2120
01:43:37.116 --> 01:43:38.552
I can't control you

2121
01:43:38.585 --> 01:43:42.054
any more than I can
control my own daughter.

2122
01:43:42.088 --> 01:43:44.784
I named you after her, Barbara.

2123
01:43:44.809 --> 01:43:48.713
And I always hoped for
you like I hoped for her.

2124
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:51.265
We mothers stand still

2125
01:43:51.298 --> 01:43:55.713
so our daughters can look back
to see how far they've come.

2126
01:44:00.607 --> 01:44:04.010
So, being human's not
something I need to...

2127
01:44:04.043 --> 01:44:08.588
ask for or even
want? I can just...

2128
01:44:10.144 --> 01:44:12.829
It's something that
I just discover I am?

2129
01:44:14.421 --> 01:44:17.089
I can't in good conscience
let you take this leap

2130
01:44:17.123 --> 01:44:19.299
without you knowing
what it means.

2131
01:44:23.147 --> 01:44:24.572
Take my hands.

2132
01:44:31.441 --> 01:44:32.955
Now close your eyes.

2133
01:44:43.283 --> 01:44:44.820
