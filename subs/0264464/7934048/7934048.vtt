1
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.030
Thank you very much

2
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.030
and welcome to To Tell the Truth.

3
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.530
Our first guest, he's made a career out

4
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.530
of being the most outrageous impostor

5
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.780
that we've ever come across

6
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.780
on this show. You'll see what I mean.

7
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.370
Number One,

8
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.370
what is your name, please?

9
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.460
My name is Frank William Abagnale.

10
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.960
-Number Two?

11
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.960
-My name is Frank William Abagnale.

12
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.460
-Number Three?

13
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.460
-My name is Frank William Abagnale.

14
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.380
From 1964 to 1967,

15
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.550
I successfully impersonated

16
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.550
an airline pilot for Pan Am Airways,

17
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.470
and I flew over two million miles

18
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.470
for free.

19
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.720
During that time,

20
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.730
I was also the Chief Resident

21
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.730
Paediatrician at a Georgia hospital

22
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.230
and an Assistant Attorney General

23
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.230
for the State of Louisiana.

24
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.900
By the time I was caught,

25
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.400
I was considered the youngest and most

26
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.400
daring con man in U. S. history.

27
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.660
I had cashed almost $4 million

28
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.660
in fraudulent cheques

29
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.990
in 26 foreign countries and all 50 states.

30
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.330
And I did it all before my 19th birthday.

31
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.670
My name is Frank William Abagnale.

32
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.920
So, for the first time,

33
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.920
he'll have to tell the truth.

34
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.090
We'll start our questioning with Kitty.

35
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.930
Thank you. Number One,

36
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.930
why, with all your talent,

37
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.100
and you're obviously

38
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.100
a very bright fellow,

39
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.480
why didn't you go in for

40
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.480
a legitimate profession?

41
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.770
It was a question of dollars and cents.

42
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.730
When I was a young man,

43
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.730
I needed the money,

44
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.530
and I thought this list of careers was

45
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.530
the easiest way to get it.

46
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.450
I see. Number Two,

47
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.450
I find this all very fascinating.

48
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.160
Who was it that finally caught you?

49
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.700
His name was Carl Hanratty.

50
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.750
Hanratty.

51
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.800
I am

52
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.840
Carl Hanratty.

53
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.510
I represent the F.B.I.

54
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.510
from the United States of America.

55
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.430
I have orders to see

56
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.430
the American prisoner, Abagnale.

57
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.670
You sit here.

58
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.970
You do not open the door.

59
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.970
You do not pass him

60
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.300
anything through the hole.

61
00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.570
Jesus.

62
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.170
You know,

63
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.170
I've got a little bit of a cold myself.

64
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.090
Frank, I'm here to read

65
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.090
the articles of extradition

66
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.970
according to the European Court

67
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.970
for Human Rights.

68
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.390
"Article One,

69
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.770
"extradition shall be granted

70
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.770
in respect of offences..."

71
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.520
Help me.

72
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.320
Help me.

73
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.030
Frank, stop it.

74
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.910
Help me.

75
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.580
You don't think

76
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.580
you're actually going to fool me, do you?

77
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.500
Sixteen pages to go.

78
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.500
Stay with me. "Article Two,

79
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.750
"if the request for extradition

80
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.750
includes separate offences...

81
00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.010
"...each of which is punishable under

82
00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.010
the laws of the requesting party..."

83
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.130
Frank?

84
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:08.850
God damn it!

85
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.180
Get me a doctor in here!

86
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.180
I need a doctor!

87
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.270
-Yes.

88
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.270
-Doctor! Now!

89
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.980
Don't sweat it.

90
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.980
We'll get you right to a doctor.

91
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.950
If you can hear me, don't worry.

92
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.950
I'll take you home in the morning.

93
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.200
Home in the morning, Frank.

94
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.450
-What are you doing?

95
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.450
-Washing off the lice.

96
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.790
This man has to be on a plane

97
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.790
for America. He has to see a doctor.

98
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.960
Yes, the doctor comes in tomorrow.

99
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.380
I've worked too long, too hard,

100
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.380
for you to take this away from me.

101
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.340
If he dies, I'm holding you responsible.

102
00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.310
Oh, Frank.

103
00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.360
Okay, Carl,

104
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.280
let's go home.

105
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:51.370
The New Rochelle Rotary Club

106
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:51.370
has a history that goes back to 1919.

107
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.870
In all those years,

108
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.370
we've only seen a handful

109
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.370
of deserving gentlemen

110
00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.750
inducted as lifetime members.

111
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.710
It's an honour that has seen 57 names

112
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.960
enshrined on the wall of honour.

113
00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:09.260
And tonight, we make it 58.

114
00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:11.800
So please stand

115
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:16.430
as I present my very good friend,

116
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:16.430
a man who keeps our pencils sharp

117
00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:18.770
and our pens in ink.

118
00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.480
Frank William Abagnale.

119
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.920
I stand here, humbled

120
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.590
by the presence of

121
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.590
Mayor Robert Wagner

122
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:53.970
and our club president, Jack Barnes.

123
00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:02.440
Most of all, I'm honoured to see

124
00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:02.440
my loving wife, Paula

125
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.190
and my son, Frank, Jr.

126
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.690
Come on.

127
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.790
Sitting in the front row.

128
00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:26.040
Two little mice fell in a bucket of cream.

129
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.670
The first mouse quickly gave up

130
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.670
and drowned.

131
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:33.380
The second mouse

132
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:35.300
wouldn't quit.

133
00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.680
He struggled so hard

134
00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.980
that eventually he churned that cream

135
00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.980
into butter

136
00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.810
and crawled out.

137
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:47.060
Gentlemen, as of this moment,

138
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:47.060
I am that second mouse.

139
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:07.170
You're a better dancer than your father.

140
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.090
-Hear that, Daddy?

141
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.090
-Like fun.

142
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.510
The girls don't know what they're in for.

143
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:13.920
Show him the dance you were doing

144
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:13.920
when we met.

145
00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:15.760
Who can remember?

146
00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:20.350
The people in that little French village

147
00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:20.350
were so happy to see Americans,

148
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.020
they decided to put on a show for us.

149
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.850
-So they crammed 200 soldiers...

150
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.850
-We know the story, Daddy.

151
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.020
...into that tiny social hall,

152
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:32.190
and the first person to walk on stage

153
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:32.190
is your mother

154
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.280
and she starts to dance.

155
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.950
You know, it had been months

156
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:40.700
since we'd seen a woman,

157
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:40.700
and here's this blond angel.

158
00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.540
Blond bombshell.

159
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:47.460
And the men

160
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:47.460
are literally holding their breath.

161
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.590
Holding their breath for you. Hear that?

162
00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.130
I turned to my buddies and I said...

163
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.800
"I will not leave France without her."

164
00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.390
And I didn't.

165
00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:59.930
You didn't.

166
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.970
I didn't.

167
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.770
Oh, shit, the rug.

168
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:06.980
-Oh, Mom.

169
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:06.980
-I can't believe I...

170
00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.060
It's nothing.

171
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.400
-Frankie, run and get a towel.

172
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.400
-Yeah.

173
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.770
Come on.

174
00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:18.490
Dance with me, Paula.

175
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.290
Whenever I dance for you,

176
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.290
I get in trouble.

177
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.600
Frank. Wake up. Come on, let's go.

178
00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.350
Get up, come on.

179
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.270
-Frank, wake up.

180
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.270
-Dad.

181
00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.940
You don't have to go to school today.

182
00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.940
It's okay.

183
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:59.200
-Why? Is it snowing?

184
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:59.200
-Do you have a black suit?

185
00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.370
I overslept again.

186
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:04.700
We have a very important meeting

187
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:04.700
in the city. Eat that.

188
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:06.040
Come on.

189
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.790
Ma'am, open up, please. It's important.

190
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:11.460
What? Oh, gosh.

191
00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:15.460
-We don't open for half an hour.

192
00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:15.460
-Just open the door. It's important.

193
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.800
I'm sorry, we don't open for half an hour.

194
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.470
What's your name, ma'am?

195
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:22.140
-Darcy.

196
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:22.140
-Darcy. That's a pretty name.

197
00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:25.560
I'm in a fix. I need a suit for my kid.

198
00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:25.560
This is my son, Frank.

199
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.310
He needs a black suit.

200
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:31.730
There was a death in the family.

201
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:31.730
My father, 85 years old, war hero.

202
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.980
There's a funeral this afternoon,

203
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.980
military funeral,

204
00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:38.150
planes flying overhead, 21-gun salute.

205
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.490
Frank needs to borrow a suit

206
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.490
for a couple of hours.

207
00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.240
I'm sorry,

208
00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.240
we don't loan suits and we're not open.

209
00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:47.370
Darcy, please. Come back.

210
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.540
Darcy, is this yours?

211
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:58.710
I just found it in the parking lot.

212
00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.890
Must have slipped right off your neck.

213
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.270
Don't hit the kerb.

214
00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.650
Now get out, walk around the back

215
00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.650
and hold the door open for me.

216
00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.120
-What's next?

217
00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.120
-Okay. Stop grinning.

218
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:33.370
When I get inside,

219
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:33.370
go back to the front seat and wait.

220
00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.710
Even if a cop comes

221
00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.710
and writes you a ticket,

222
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:37.880
don't move the car, understood?

223
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.710
Dad, what's all this for?

224
00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.920
You know why the Yankees always win?

225
00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:43.720
Because they have Mickey Mantle?

226
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.720
No, it's because the other teams can't

227
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.720
stop staring at those damn pinstripes.

228
00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:51.310
Watch this. The manager

229
00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:51.310
of Chase Manhattan Bank

230
00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:54.810
is about to open the door for your father.

231
00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.480
Mr Abagnale,

232
00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.240
we don't usually loan money to people

233
00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.900
who have unresolved business

234
00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.900
with the IRS.

235
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:07.160
That's a misunderstanding.

236
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:07.160
I hired the wrong guy to do my books.

237
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.490
A mistake anybody could make.

238
00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.330
I just need you guys

239
00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.330
to help me weather the storm.

240
00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:15.330
You're being investigated

241
00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:15.330
by the government for tax fraud.

242
00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:20.170
My store is a landmark in New Rochelle.

243
00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:20.170
I have customers all over New York.

244
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.380
You're not a customer

245
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.380
at Chase Manhattan.

246
00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.590
We don't know you.

247
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:26.680
I'm sure your bank in New Rochelle

248
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:26.680
could help you out.

249
00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.350
My bank went out of business.

250
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:30.680
Banks like this one

251
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:30.680
put them out of business.

252
00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:35.100
I know I made a mistake, I admit that.

253
00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:35.100
But these people want blood.

254
00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:38.980
They want my store.

255
00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:38.980
They've threatened to put me in jail.

256
00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.860
This is America, right?

257
00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.860
I'm not a criminal.

258
00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.190
I'm a Medal of Honour winner.

259
00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.570
A member

260
00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.570
of the New Rochelle Rotary Club.

261
00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:50.160
All I'm asking is

262
00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:50.160
for you to help me beat these guys.

263
00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:53.870
It's not a question of winning and losing,

264
00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:53.870
it's a question of risk.

265
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:58.380
You're the largest bank in the world.

266
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:58.380
Where's the...

267
00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.040
Where's the risk?

268
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:08.720
How could you let him

269
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:08.720
take our car like that?

270
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.640
He didn't take anything, we took him.

271
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.640
He overpaid by 500.

272
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.390
Come on, Frank. Let's return the suit.

273
00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.820
This place is good.

274
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:30.070
It's small, but it's gonna be

275
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:30.070
a lot less work.

276
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.780
A lot less work for you.

277
00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:57.140
Hey, Dad.

278
00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:59.100
Hi.

279
00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:04.650
Where is your mother?

280
00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.360
I don't know.

281
00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:11.110
She said something

282
00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:11.110
about going to look for a job.

283
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.740
What's she going to be,

284
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.740
a shoe salesman at a centipede farm?

285
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:23.090
What are you doing?

286
00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:26.260
You want some pancakes?

287
00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:29.510
For dinner? On my son's 16th birthday?

288
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:32.010
We're not going to eat pancakes.

289
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.100
Why are you looking at me like that?

290
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.100
You thought I forgot?

291
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.270
-I didn't think you forgot.

292
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.270
-I opened a checking account

293
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:42.850
in your name.

294
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:46.400
I put $25 in the account

295
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:46.400
so you can buy whatever you want.

296
00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.650
-Don't tell your mother.

297
00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.650
-I won't.

298
00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:50.200
Thanks, Dad.

299
00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:53.820
Didn't that bank turn you down

300
00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:53.820
for a loan?

301
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:56.200
Yes, they all turned me down.

302
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:58.660
Then why you opening

303
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:58.660
a banking account with them?

304
00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:01.580
Because one day, you'll want

305
00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:01.580
something from these people.

306
00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:03.420
A house, a car...

307
00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.920
They have all the money.

308
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.050
There's 50 cheques there, Frank,

309
00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:14.550
which means, from this day on,

310
00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.180
you're in their little club.

311
00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.770
I'm in their little club.

312
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:24.690
You got that, you got it all.

313
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.190
It's even got my name there.

314
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:31.070
-To the moon.

315
00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.200
To the moon.

316
00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:45.540
See that? It's just a school.

317
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:48.380
No different than Westbourne.

318
00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:51.340
Ma, you said you were going to quit.

319
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:58.310
Frankie, you don't have to wear

320
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:58.310
the uniform here.

321
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:02.020
Why don't you take off your jacket?

322
00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:03.940
I'm used to it.

323
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.980
-Excuse me.

324
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.980
-Yes?

325
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:12.940
Do you know where room 17,

326
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:12.940
French is?

327
00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:14.150
Yeah...

328
00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.500
You selling encyclopaedias?

329
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:33.170
He looks like a substitute teacher.

330
00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.650
Quiet down, people!

331
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.980
My name is Mr Abagnale!

332
00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.700
That's Abagnale, not Abagnolee,

333
00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.700
not Abagnelee, but Abagnale.

334
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:05.080
Now, somebody please tell me

335
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:05.080
where you left off in your textbooks.

336
00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:07.750
Excuse me, people.

337
00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:07.750
If I need to ask again,

338
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:09.170
I'm gonna write up the entire class.

339
00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.920
Take your seats!

340
00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:17.090
Chapter seven.

341
00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.930
Would you please open your textbooks

342
00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.930
to chapter eight

343
00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:21.930
and we'll get started.

344
00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.680
-Excuse me. What's your name?

345
00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.680
-Brad.

346
00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:26.310
Why don't you get up here

347
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:30.150
in front of the class

348
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:30.150
and read conversation number five?

349
00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.580
They sent for me.

350
00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.540
They said they needed

351
00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.540
a sub for Roberta.

352
00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:52.040
I came all the way from Dixon.

353
00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.380
I always sub for Roberta.

354
00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.670
Excuse me, why aren't you reading?

355
00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:02.550
I'll never come back

356
00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:02.550
to Bellarmine-Jefferson again!

357
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.600
You tell them not to call me.

358
00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.060
Do they think it's easy

359
00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.060
for a woman my age

360
00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:10.770
and all the money that it costs to travel?

361
00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:10.770
I tell you, they don't give a damn.

362
00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:12.440
Mr and Mrs Abagnale,

363
00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.320
this is not a question

364
00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.320
of your son's attendance.

365
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.400
I regret to inform you

366
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.400
that for the past week,

367
00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:22.070
Frank has been teaching

368
00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:22.070
Mrs Glasser's French class.

369
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.240
He what?

370
00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:29.500
Your son has been pretending to be

371
00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:29.500
a substitute teacher.

372
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:33.170
Lecturing the students,

373
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:33.170
giving out homework...

374
00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:35.840
Mrs Glasser has been ill,

375
00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:39.090
and there was some confusion

376
00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:39.090
with the real sub.

377
00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:43.180
Your son held

378
00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:43.180
a teacher-parent conference yesterday

379
00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.600
and was planning a class field trip

380
00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.390
to a French bread factory in Trenton.

381
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:51.810
Do you see the problem we have?

382
00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:57.730
I've a note to miss fifth and sixth period

383
00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:57.730
today. Doctor's appointment.

384
00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.400
One moment. I'll be right with you.

385
00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.280
-You should fold it.

386
00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.280
-What?

387
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:08.830
That note. It's a fake, right?

388
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:08.830
You should fold it.

389
00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:11.710
It's a note from my mom.

390
00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:11.710
I have a doctor's appointment.

391
00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:14.630
Yeah, but there's no crease

392
00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:14.630
in the paper.

393
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:16.550
When your mom hands you a note

394
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:16.550
to miss school,

395
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:20.550
the first thing you do is fold it

396
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:20.550
and put it in your pocket.

397
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:23.130
If it's real, where's the crease?

398
00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:34.190
Frankie.

399
00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.580
Ma, I'm home.

400
00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:57.880
Remember that girl Joanna

401
00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:57.880
I was telling you about?

402
00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:00.170
I asked her out today.

403
00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:04.340
Think we're going to go

404
00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:04.340
to the junior prom.

405
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:07.850
Ma, is this my driver's licence?

406
00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:10.470
That's all there is, two bedrooms.

407
00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.890
Frankie.

408
00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:14.140
You remember Dad's friend?

409
00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.860
Jack Barnes. From the club.

410
00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:18.110
Hello.

411
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:20.400
He came by looking for your father.

412
00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.030
I was giving him a tour of the apartment.

413
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:26.030
It's very spacious, Paula.

414
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:33.660
Dad is at the store.

415
00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:35.870
So, Frank,

416
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:40.420
you're getting to look

417
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:40.420
more like your old man every day.

418
00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.760
Thanks for the sandwich, Paula.

419
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.800
-I'll see you later.

420
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.800
-Wait.

421
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:54.850
Is this yours?

422
00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:00.690
Thanks, Frank.

423
00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:00.690
That's the President's pin.

424
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:04.820
I'd be in deep trouble if I lost that.

425
00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.580
I'll see you all later.

426
00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:25.720
Are you hungry, Frankie?

427
00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:25.720
I'll make you a sandwich.

428
00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.810
Jack wanted to talk business

429
00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.810
with your father.

430
00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:42.690
He thinks we should get a lawyer

431
00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:42.690
and sue the government.

432
00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.650
That it's not legal,

433
00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.650
what they're doing to us.

434
00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:51.870
Why aren't you saying anything?

435
00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:01.080
You're not going to tell him, are you?

436
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:03.710
No.

437
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:07.340
That's right. There's nothing to tell.

438
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:13.050
I'm going out for a few hours to visit

439
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:13.050
some old friends from the tennis club.

440
00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:16.390
When I get home,

441
00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:16.390
we'll all have dinner together.

442
00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:17.980
Right?

443
00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:22.440
But you won't say anything

444
00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:22.440
because it's just silly,

445
00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:23.900
isn't it?

446
00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.480
How could we sue anybody?

447
00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.620
Do you need some money, Frankie?

448
00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.120
A few dollars to buy

449
00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.120
some record albums?

450
00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:40.580
Here. Take $5.

451
00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:43.460
Or 10.

452
00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:51.970
You promised you were going to quit.

453
00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:12.490
Ma, I'm home.

454
00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.550
You stay away from me. You hear me?

455
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:33.340
I don't know who you are,

456
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:33.340
but if you come back here...

457
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:36.430
Frank, calm down, will you?

458
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:36.430
I'm Dick Kesner.

459
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:40.890
I want you to leave your things here,

460
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:40.890
follow me into the next room.

461
00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.520
Okay? They're all waiting for you.

462
00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:48.400
You don't have to be scared.

463
00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:48.400
I'm right here, Frank.

464
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.280
I'll always be here.

465
00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:54.450
But there are laws. Everything in

466
00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:54.450
this country has to be legal.

467
00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:57.280
So what we need to do

468
00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:57.280
is make some decisions.

469
00:26:57.370 --> 00:26:58.830
That's what Mr Kesner is here for.

470
00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:01.620
Many times these decisions

471
00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:01.620
are left up to the courts.

472
00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.750
But that can be very expensive,

473
00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.750
people fighting over their children.

474
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:06.080
Nobody is fighting.

475
00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:08.920
Look at me, Frank. Nobody is fighting.

476
00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:21.600
Do you remember your grandma? Eve?

477
00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:21.600
She arrived this morning.

478
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:23.560
Hello.

479
00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:36.110
Do you understand

480
00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:36.110
what we're saying to you, Frank?

481
00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:40.660
Your father and I are getting a divorce.

482
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.710
Nothing's going to change.

483
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.710
We're still gonna see each other.

484
00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:50.380
-Stop it, please. Don't interrupt.

485
00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:50.380
-You don't have to read all of this.

486
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:53.210
Most of it is for your parents,

487
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:53.210
boring adult business.

488
00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:55.930
But this paragraph right here,

489
00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:55.930
this is important

490
00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:59.180
because it states

491
00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:59.180
who you're gonna live with

492
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:01.760
after the divorce.

493
00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:03.730
Whose custody you will be in.

494
00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:06.520
And there's a blank space right here.

495
00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:11.150
I want you to go into the kitchen,

496
00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:11.150
sit at the table

497
00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:12.730
and put a name down.

498
00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:13.990
You can take as long as you want,

499
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:15.610
but when you come back into this room,

500
00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:18.200
I want to see a name on that line.

501
00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:22.120
Frank, just write down a name

502
00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:22.120
and this will all be over.

503
00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:23.870
It's going to be okay.

504
00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:25.620
Dad, what name?

505
00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:27.000
Your mother or your father.

506
00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.960
Just put the name there.

507
00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.960
It's as simple as that.

508
00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:33.250
And don't look so scared. It's not a test.

509
00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:36.090
There's no wrong answer.

510
00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:52.650
One ticket to Grand Central, please.

511
00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:54.780
That will be $3.50, sir.

512
00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:58.570
Is it okay if I write you a cheque?

513
00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:06.200
Carl, when do I get to call my father?

514
00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:09.250
You can call him when we get

515
00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:09.250
to New York.

516
00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:11.500
We leave for the airport in seven hours.

517
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.130
Until then, just sit there.

518
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:16.630
Be quiet.

519
00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:21.510
On the other side of the hotel,

520
00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:21.510
they got suites that face the park.

521
00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:25.640
It's the best room the F.B.I. can afford.

522
00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.900
It's okay, I've stayed in worse.

523
00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.310
Please. You have to listen.

524
00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:36.730
I don't want to hear your story.

525
00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:36.730
Two cheques bounced.

526
00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:38.610
You know how much trouble I'm in?

527
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.200
No, but listen. I'm telling you.

528
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.200
The bank, they made the mistake.

529
00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.910
I'll write you another cheque right now!

530
00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:45.030
What? Do I look like

531
00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:45.030
I was born yesterday?

532
00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.000
Look, it's midnight.

533
00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.000
Where am I going to go?

534
00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.420
You're a goddamn kid. Go home.

535
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:42.180
I hope you understand. My boss

536
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:42.180
sent me to Brooklyn, then Queens.

537
00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:43.720
Now he wants me in Long Island

538
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.600
to take a few clients out

539
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.600
for a night on the town.

540
00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:50.600
I'm sorry, but we're not allowed

541
00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:50.600
to cash cheques from other banks.

542
00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.600
-How would we know if they were good?

543
00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.600
-What did you say your name was?

544
00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:55.400
-Ashley.

545
00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.730
You know what I found

546
00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.730
on the sidewalk out there?

547
00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:06.410
Must have slipped right off your neck.

548
00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:13.580
Is there something

549
00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:13.580
I can help you with, son?

550
00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:15.960
It's my grandmother's birthday

551
00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:15.960
next week

552
00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.670
and I want to get her something

553
00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.670
extra special.

554
00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:22.590
Please, it's my midterm next week

555
00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:22.590
and my books were stolen.

556
00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:27.010
Please, just $5.

557
00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:27.010
No one would have to know.

558
00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.470
I'm sorry,

559
00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.470
but we are not allowed to take cheques

560
00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.680
from people we don't know.

561
00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:57.500
Welcome to New York.

562
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:16.060
Pleasure to have you back, Captain.

563
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:20.270
What do you think, Angelo?

564
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:20.270
The tomatoes are ripe this afternoon.

565
00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:28.700
What have we here?

566
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.870
-Can I have your autograph?

567
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.870
-You betcha.

568
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:34.540
-Can I have your autograph, too?

569
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:34.540
-You gonna be a pilot?

570
00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.790
There you go. Work hard in school.

571
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:38.210
Dear Dad,

572
00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:40.790
I've decided to become an airline pilot.

573
00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.710
I've applied to all the big airlines,

574
00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.880
and I have several promising interviews

575
00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.880
lined up.

576
00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:49.050
How is Mom?

577
00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:49.050
Have you called her lately?

578
00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:51.720
Love, your son, Frank.

579
00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:56.600
Hello.

580
00:32:57.390 --> 00:32:59.480
I'm Frank Black

581
00:32:57.390 --> 00:32:59.480
from Murrow High School,

582
00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.270
and I have an appointment

583
00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.270
with Mr Morgan.

584
00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:05.150
You're the young man who's writing

585
00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:05.150
the article for the school paper.

586
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:06.240
Yes, ma'am. That's me.

587
00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.740
I want to know everything there is

588
00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.740
to know about being a pilot.

589
00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:13.080
What airports does Pan Am fly to?

590
00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:13.080
What does a pilot make in a year?

591
00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.870
Who tells them where they're gonna

592
00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.870
fly to?

593
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:17.160
-Slow down. Take them one at a time.

594
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:17.160
-All right.

595
00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:20.000
What does it mean when

596
00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:20.000
one pilot says to another pilot,

597
00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.250
"What kind of equipment are you on?"

598
00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:25.170
They want to know what aircraft

599
00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:25.170
you're flying. DC-8, 707, Constellation...

600
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:28.260
And what about those I.D. badges

601
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:28.260
that I've seen pilots wear?

602
00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.680
Every pilot must have two things

603
00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.680
with him at all times.

604
00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.260
One is his airline personnel badge,

605
00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.260
looks just like this one from Pan Am.

606
00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:36.930
The other one is their FAA licence.

607
00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:39.520
And that looks just like this.

608
00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:45.070
Do you think I could make a copy

609
00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:45.070
of this to put into my article?

610
00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:48.280
Frank, you can have that one,

611
00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:48.280
it's three years expired.

612
00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.450
Thanks. And what about

613
00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.450
your I.D. badge?

614
00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:51.820
Do you have an extra one

615
00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:51.820
I could borrow?

616
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:53.450
No, I can't help you there.

617
00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:55.030
Those are special-ordered

618
00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:55.030
from Polaroid.

619
00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.950
The only way to get one

620
00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.950
is to become a real live pilot

621
00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.500
for Pan American Airways.

622
00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.210
Pan Am, may I help you?

623
00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:08.630
Yeah. Hello, I'm calling about a uniform.

624
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:10.970
-Hold for Purchasing.

625
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:10.970
-Thank you.

626
00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:12.260
Purchasing.

627
00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:15.010
I'm a copilot based out of

628
00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:15.010
San Francisco.

629
00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:17.270
I flew a flight into New York last night,

630
00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:20.640
but the problem is I'm headed out

631
00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:20.640
to Paris in three hours.

632
00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:22.400
How can we help you?

633
00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:25.980
I sent my uniform to be cleaned

634
00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:25.980
through the hotel

635
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:28.030
and I guess they must have lost it.

636
00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:30.440
They lost a uniform.

637
00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:30.440
Happens all the time.

638
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:33.490
Go down to the Well-Built Uniform

639
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:33.490
Company at 9th and Broadway.

640
00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:34.660
They're our uniform supplier.

641
00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:36.740
I'll tell Mr Rosen you're coming.

642
00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:38.790
You look too young to be a pilot.

643
00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:40.500
I'm a copilot.

644
00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:42.370
Why so nervous?

645
00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:47.040
How would you feel if you lost

646
00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:47.040
your uniform first week on the job?

647
00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:50.170
Relax. Pan Am has got lots of uniforms.

648
00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.510
It's gonna be $164.

649
00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:55.510
Great. I'll write you a cheque.

650
00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.720
Sorry, no checks, no cash.

651
00:34:57.850 --> 00:35:00.310
You'll have to fill in

652
00:34:57.850 --> 00:35:00.310
your employee I.D. number.

653
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:04.520
I'll bill Pan Am, and they'll take it out

654
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:04.520
of your next paycheck.

655
00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:07.020
Even better.

656
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:10.400
Dear Dad,

657
00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:13.570
you always told me

658
00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:13.570
that an honest man has nothing to fear.

659
00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:16.530
So I'm trying my best not to be afraid.

660
00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.740
I'm sorry I ran away,

661
00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.740
but you don't have to worry.

662
00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:24.210
I'm gonna get it all back now, Daddy.

663
00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:24.210
I promise. I'm gonna get it all back.

664
00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.550
Are you a real live pilot?

665
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.880
I sure am, little lady. What's your name?

666
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:37.640
-Celine.

667
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:37.640
-Celine, it's a pleasure to meet you.

668
00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:40.140
It's a pleasure to meet you, too.

669
00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:48.310
That's 50, 70, 80, 90,

670
00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.150
$100.

671
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:52.530
You have yourself a great time in Paris.

672
00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:54.070
I always do.

673
00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:56.070
Excuse me.

674
00:35:57.410 --> 00:35:59.410
I'm John Modiger. I manage this branch.

675
00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:01.700
I want to thank you for coming in

676
00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:01.700
and using our institution.

677
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:03.870
It's a pleasure to meet you, John.

678
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:03.870
I'll be back again.

679
00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:04.960
Good.

680
00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:07.580
Have you stayed with us before?

681
00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:11.170
No, I've been primarily based

682
00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:11.170
on the West Coast.

683
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:13.670
Is it all right if I write you a cheque

684
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:13.670
for the room?

685
00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.800
-No problem, sir.

686
00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.800
-Great.

687
00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:28.440
I was also wondering

688
00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:28.440
if I could write you a personal cheque?

689
00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:31.730
For airline personnel,

690
00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:31.730
we cash personal cheques up to $100.

691
00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:33.480
Payroll cheques we cash up to 300.

692
00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:37.780
Did you say 300 for a payroll cheque?

693
00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:44.160
Dear Dad,

694
00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:47.750
I've decided to become a pilot

695
00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:47.750
for Pan American Airways,

696
00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:50.250
the most trusted name in the skies.

697
00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:54.550
They've accepted me into their training

698
00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:54.550
programme and told me if I work hard,

699
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:56.880
I should earn my wings real soon.

700
00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:00.090
Please get in touch with Joanna Carlton

701
00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:00.090
from the 10th grade.

702
00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:03.310
Tell her I'm sorry that I could not

703
00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:03.310
take her to the junior prom.

704
00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:05.680
Love, your son, Frank.

705
00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:46.430
-Hello, how are you?

706
00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:46.430
-Fine, thank you.

707
00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:48.640
I have a payroll cheque I'd like to cash.

708
00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:50.190
Certainly.

709
00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:53.270
Excuse me.

710
00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:56.030
I'm sure you hear this all the time,

711
00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:59.700
but you have the most beautiful eyes

712
00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:59.700
I have ever seen.

713
00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:02.950
Yeah, I do get that all the time.

714
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:05.370
How would you like it?

715
00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:25.260
I'm sorry, sir. We won't have any cash

716
00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:25.260
until the banks open in an hour.

717
00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:28.890
But I'm sure they can cash your cheque

718
00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:28.890
at the airport.

719
00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:30.890
The airport?

720
00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:33.270
Who cashes cheques at the airport?

721
00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:36.900
The airlines.

722
00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:36.900
They've always taken care of their own.

723
00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:48.290
-Hello.

724
00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:48.290
-Hi. Are you deadheading?

725
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:49.950
What?

726
00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.410
Are you my deadhead to Miami?

727
00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:56.090
Yes.

728
00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.590
Yeah, I'm the deadhead. Here you go.

729
00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:03.430
You're a little late,

730
00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:03.430
but the jump seat is open.

731
00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:10.470
It's been a while since I've done this.

732
00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:10.470
Which one is the jump seat again?

733
00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:12.980
Have a nice flight.

734
00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:15.060
Are you my deadhead?

735
00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:20.650
Frank, Captain Oliver.

736
00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:20.650
John Larkin, the copilot.

737
00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:22.530
Fred Tulley, flight engineer.

738
00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:25.360
Frank Taylor, Pan Am.

739
00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:25.360
Thanks for giving me a lift, boys.

740
00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:28.370
Go ahead and take a seat, Frank.

741
00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:28.370
We're about to push.

742
00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:30.620
What kind of equipment you on, DC-8?

743
00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:31.830
707.

744
00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:34.370
You turning around on the redeye?

745
00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:36.790
I'm jumping puddles

746
00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:36.790
for the next few months,

747
00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:40.130
trying to earn my keep running

748
00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:40.130
leap frogs for the weak and weary.

749
00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:42.800
No shame in that. We all did it.

750
00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:52.020
-Have a seat.

751
00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:52.020
-Thank you.

752
00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:55.310
Would you like a drink after takeoff?

753
00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.600
Milk?

754
00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.980
-Eighty knots.

755
00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.980
-Check.

756
00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.110
V-one. Rotate.

757
00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:05.990
V-two. Positive rate.

758
00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:07.360
Gear up.

759
00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.830
Dear Dad, today was graduation.

760
00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:16.000
I am now a copilot,

761
00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:16.000
earning $1,400 a month, plus benefits.

762
00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:20.250
And the best part is,

763
00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:20.250
they tell me my family can fly for free.

764
00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:23.210
So tell Mom to pack her bags

765
00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:23.210
and buy a new swimsuit

766
00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:26.720
because I'm taking us all to Hawaii

767
00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:26.720
for Christmas.

768
00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:30.220
I love you, Dad. Aloha, Frank.

769
00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:32.600
-Hello, deadhead.

770
00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:32.600
-Hello.

771
00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.730
Enjoying your free ride?

772
00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:42.020
Marci,

773
00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:45.030
did you drop this?

774
00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:51.030
-Must have slipped right off your neck.

775
00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:51.030
-No.

776
00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:53.830
No!

777
00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:59.080
Yes, yes, yes!

778
00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:08.840
Why are you stopping?

779
00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:12.890
I want to tell you something, Marci.

780
00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.230
This is by far

781
00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:20.560
the best date I have ever been on.

782
00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:55.510
Welcome to Miami Mutual Bank.

783
00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:55.510
How may I help you?

784
00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:58.230
My name is Frank Taylor.

785
00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:58.230
I'm a copilot for Pan Am.

786
00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:01.440
I'd like to cash this cheque and then

787
00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.770
I'd like to take you out for a steak dinner.

788
00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.700
Then we feed the cheques

789
00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.700
into the MICR machine,

790
00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:19.250
which uses special ink to encode

791
00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:22.120
the account numbers

792
00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:22.120
on the bottom of the checks.

793
00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:25.130
And where are these numbers?

794
00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:28.960
-They're right here.

795
00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:28.960
-Right there?

796
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:34.640
They're called routing numbers.

797
00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.470
So where do the cheques get routed to?

798
00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:42.640
I don't exactly know.

799
00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:42.640
Nobody ever asked me that before.

800
00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:47.070
Our next item up for bid is also from

801
00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:47.070
the Jersey Central Bank foreclosure.

802
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:50.490
This is a MICR encoder,

803
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:50.490
a machine used to encode bank checks.

804
00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:51.990
Do I have an opening bid?

805
00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:55.450
Our unknown subject is a paperhanger

806
00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:55.450
who started working on the East Coast.

807
00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:57.240
In the last few weeks,

808
00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:57.240
this unsub has developed

809
00:42:57.330 --> 00:43:00.250
a new form of cheque fraud

810
00:42:57.330 --> 00:43:00.250
I'm calling "The Float."

811
00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:03.210
What he's doing is he's opening

812
00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:03.210
checking accounts at various banks,

813
00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:06.790
then changing the MICR ink routing

814
00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:06.790
numbers at the bottom of those checks.

815
00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:10.590
Next slide, please. Next slide, please.

816
00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:14.050
The remote thing is broken.

817
00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:14.050
You'll have to do it by hand.

818
00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:19.680
Agent Mullen, it should be

819
00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:19.680
the square button by the side.

820
00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:22.180
This carousel doesn't work.

821
00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:22.180
It's a bad carousel.

822
00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:24.060
-Thank you.

823
00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:24.060
-Move it manually.

824
00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:27.820
This is a map of the 12 banks

825
00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:27.820
of the U.S. Federal Reserve.

826
00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:29.150
Slide.

827
00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:32.530
MICR scanners at every bank

828
00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:32.530
read these numbers

829
00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:34.570
at the bottom of the cheque. Slide.

830
00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:37.990
And then ship that cheque off

831
00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:37.990
to its corresponding branch.

832
00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:41.580
Carl, for those of us

833
00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:41.580
who are unfamiliar with bank fraud,

834
00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:44.960
you mind telling us

835
00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:44.960
what the hell you're talking about?

836
00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:49.130
The East Coast branches

837
00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:49.130
are numbered 01 to 06.

838
00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:51.800
The central branch is 07, 08,

839
00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:51.800
so on and so forth.

840
00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.550
You mean those numbers at the bottom

841
00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.550
of a cheque actually mean something?

842
00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:58.640
All of this was in the report I filed

843
00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:58.640
two days ago. If you change

844
00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:03.060
a 02 to a 12, that means that cheque,

845
00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:04.480
which was cashed in New York,

846
00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.020
does not go

847
00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.020
to the New York Federal Branch,

848
00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:10.440
but it is re-routed all the way

849
00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:10.440
to the San Francisco Federal Branch.

850
00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:13.030
The bank doesn't even know

851
00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:13.030
the cheque has bounced for two weeks.

852
00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:15.740
Which means our unsub

853
00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:15.740
can stay in one place,

854
00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:19.580
paper the same city over and over again

855
00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:19.580
while his cheques circle the country.

856
00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:21.910
You want to talk to my wife.

857
00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:24.750
She's the one who balances

858
00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:24.750
the chequebook at our house.

859
00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:31.590
Next slide.

860
00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:39.930
Daddy.

861
00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:44.980
My son, the birdman.

862
00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:44.980
That's some uniform, Frank.

863
00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:46.810
What do you think?

864
00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:48.650
Nice.

865
00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:50.270
Sit down.

866
00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:56.030
Dad, have you gotten the postcards?

867
00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:57.360
Of course.

868
00:44:57.450 --> 00:44:58.950
This fork is ice-cold.

869
00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:01.990
No, Dad, that's a chilled salad fork.

870
00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:06.290
It's a fancy restaurant, you know.

871
00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:12.380
Here.

872
00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:16.470
-I got you something.

873
00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:16.470
-What's that?

874
00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:17.880
Open it.

875
00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:25.770
You know what those are, right?

876
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:30.900
Those are the keys

877
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:30.900
to a 1965 Cadillac DeVille convertible.

878
00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:34.400
Brand-new, Dad.

879
00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:34.400
Red with white interior,

880
00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.820
split seats, air conditioning, the works.

881
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:40.160
Are you giving me a Cadillac?

882
00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:42.320
I'm giving you a Cadillac.

883
00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:44.490
Dad, she's parked downstairs.

884
00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:47.910
When we're done eating lunch, why

885
00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:47.910
don't you drive on over to Mom's house,

886
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000
pick her up, take a little joy ride?

887
00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:51.750
Do you know what would happen

888
00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:55.630
if the IRS found out I was driving around

889
00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:55.630
in a new coupe?

890
00:45:57.340 --> 00:46:01.010
I took the train here, Frank.

891
00:45:57.340 --> 00:46:01.010
I'm taking the train home.

892
00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:04.470
All right.

893
00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:13.610
I have plenty of money.

894
00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:16.020
You know, if you ever need anything.

895
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:18.780
You worried? About me?

896
00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:21.780
No, I'm not worried.

897
00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:23.950
You think I can't buy my own car?

898
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:27.370
Two mice fell in a bucket

899
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:27.370
of cream, Frank.

900
00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:29.960
Which one am I?

901
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:32.960
You're that second mouse.

902
00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:36.960
I went by the store today.

903
00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:41.800
I had to close the store for a while.

904
00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:41.800
It's all about timing, Frank.

905
00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:44.970
Goddamn government knows that.

906
00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:44.970
They hit you when you're down.

907
00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:47.890
I wasn't going to let them take it

908
00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:47.890
from me, so I just

909
00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:50.480
shut the doors myself, called their bluff.

910
00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:58.150
Sooner or later, they'll forget about me.

911
00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:59.740
I understand.

912
00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:03.240
Have you told Ma?

913
00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:08.830
She's so stubborn, your mother.

914
00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:15.500
Don't worry, I'm not going to let her go

915
00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:15.500
without a fight.

916
00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:17.540
I'm fighting for us...

917
00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:21.260
Dad?

918
00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.180
...since the day we met.

919
00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:29.430
Daddy, out of all those men,

920
00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:32.600
you were the one that took her home,

921
00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:32.600
remember that?

922
00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:34.020
Two hundred men

923
00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:37.610
sitting in that tiny social hall,

924
00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:37.610
watching her dance.

925
00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:43.740
-What was the name of that town?

926
00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:43.740
-Montrichard, Dad.

927
00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:46.780
I didn't speak a word of French,

928
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:50.450
and six weeks later, she was my wife.

929
00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:53.620
She is your wife.

930
00:47:56.080 --> 00:48:00.460
My son bought me a Cadillac today.

931
00:47:56.080 --> 00:48:00.460
I think that calls for a toast.

932
00:48:10.310 --> 00:48:12.850
To the best damn pilot in the sky.

933
00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:17.060
It's not what you think. I'm just a copilot.

934
00:48:18.810 --> 00:48:21.440
You see these people staring at you?

935
00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:28.200
These are the most powerful people

936
00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:28.200
in New York City.

937
00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:33.080
They keep peeking over their shoulders,

938
00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:33.080
wondering where you're going tonight.

939
00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.040
Where you going, Frank?

940
00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:37.370
Dad, nobody's staring at me.

941
00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:39.580
Some place exotic?

942
00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.300
Just tell me where you're going.

943
00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:48.760
Los... Hollywood.

944
00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:50.390
Hollywood?

945
00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:54.560
Come here.

946
00:48:56.770 --> 00:49:00.110
The rest of us really are suckers.

947
00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:09.160
So I got on this red dress

948
00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:09.160
and these high heels, right?

949
00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:10.820
I got a bra out here.

950
00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:13.580
I'm chasing two Puerto Rican guys

951
00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:13.580
through the park.

952
00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:16.120
They got a suitcase

953
00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:16.120
filled with bank robbery loot.

954
00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.710
Okay, I'm screaming out,

955
00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.710
"F.B.I., freeze!"

956
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:21.250
I'm reaching for my gun,

957
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:21.250
but I can't find it in the bra.

958
00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:25.300
It's so damn big,

959
00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:25.300
I thought I was going to shoot my tits off.

960
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:30.970
That's a funny story.

961
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:30.970
People always laugh at that story.

962
00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:32.680
Let me ask you a question,

963
00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:32.680
Mr Amdursky.

964
00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:36.390
If you had so much fun undercover,

965
00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:36.390
why did you transfer to bank fraud?

966
00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:39.770
I didn't transfer.

967
00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:39.770
I was censured and reassigned.

968
00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:43.860
It's like being punished. I was punished.

969
00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:43.860
I screwed up in the field.

970
00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:46.990
What about you, Mr Fox, were you

971
00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:46.990
punished for screwing up in the field?

972
00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:49.280
No, I've never worked in the field before.

973
00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:50.910
I audited background investigations

974
00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:53.580
of Department of Justice

975
00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:53.580
clerical applicants.

976
00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:58.160
That's just great. I ask for a team

977
00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:58.160
and they drag the bottom of the Pacific.

978
00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:01.000
Mind if I ask you a question,

979
00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:01.000
Agent Hanratty?

980
00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:02.670
How come you're so serious

981
00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:02.670
all the time?

982
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:05.340
Does it bother you, Mr Amdursky?

983
00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:07.460
Yeah, it does bother me.

984
00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.670
Does it bother you, Mr Fox?

985
00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.510
A little, I guess.

986
00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:15.310
Would you like to hear me tell a joke?

987
00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:19.560
Yeah, we'd love to hear a joke from you.

988
00:50:21.350 --> 00:50:22.730
Knock, knock.

989
00:50:22.810 --> 00:50:24.270
Who's there?

990
00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:28.740
Go fuck yourselves.

991
00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:44.790
He cashed three checks.

992
00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:44.790
They all cleared.

993
00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:46.960
I was going to deposit this one today.

994
00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:50.970
I don't want any trouble.

995
00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:53.010
No trouble.

996
00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:55.100
No trouble at all.

997
00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:58.310
We'll just take this cheque

998
00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:58.310
and be on our way. Thank you.

999
00:50:58.390 --> 00:51:00.430
Because I don't want

1000
00:50:58.390 --> 00:51:00.430
my customers harassed.

1001
00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:06.270
What are you saying? He's still here?

1002
00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:08.150
201.

1003
00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:11.400
Thank you.

1004
00:51:12.490 --> 00:51:14.610
-Corner here.

1005
00:51:12.490 --> 00:51:14.610
-Thanks, son.

1006
00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:18.290
-Some steps.

1007
00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:18.290
-Steps.

1008
00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:24.000
Mr Murphy, how are you?

1009
00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.670
-Is that Frank?

1010
00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.670
-Yeah, it's Frank.

1011
00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:27.920
-Hey, Frank. How are you?

1012
00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:27.920
-How's the knee?

1013
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.170
Come on, I'll race you right now.

1014
00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:31.970
-Take care.

1015
00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:31.970
-Okay, Frank.

1016
00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:34.510
Eyeball the back? Come on, Carl.

1017
00:51:34.590 --> 00:51:36.470
This guy's a pen-and-ink man,

1018
00:51:34.590 --> 00:51:36.470
a goddamn paperhanger.

1019
00:51:36.550 --> 00:51:38.390
Why can't we go with you, Carl?

1020
00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:43.060
Keep your eyes open, do your job and

1021
00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:43.060
I'll buy you both a Good Humour bar.

1022
00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:54.990
It's all right, ma'am. F.B.I.

1023
00:51:57.530 --> 00:51:59.660
201.

1024
00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:13.090
F.B.I.!

1025
00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:23.430
F.B.I.

1026
00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:26.520
Come out of the bathroom!

1027
00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.610
Step out of the bathroom!

1028
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:36.240
-Hands on your head.

1029
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:36.240
-That's the new IBM Selectric...

1030
00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.490
-Put your hands on your head!

1031
00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.490
-...print type in five seconds...

1032
00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:39.820
Shut up!

1033
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:41.870
Put your hands on your head!

1034
00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:45.910
He's got over 200 cheques,

1035
00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:45.910
a gallon of India ink, drafting...

1036
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.330
Even has little payroll envelopes

1037
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.330
addressed to himself...

1038
00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:50.710
-Put it down! Drop it!

1039
00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:50.710
-Relax!

1040
00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:53.000
You're late, all right?

1041
00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:55.880
My name's Barry Allen,

1042
00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:55.880
United States Secret Service.

1043
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:57.590
Your boy just tried

1044
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:57.590
to jump out the window.

1045
00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:01.180
-My partner has him in custody.

1046
00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:01.180
-I don't know what you're talking about.

1047
00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:04.850
You think the F.B.I.

1048
00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:04.850
are the only ones on this guy? Come on.

1049
00:53:04.930 --> 00:53:07.020
He's dabbling in government checks.

1050
00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:10.860
We've been following a paper trail

1051
00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:10.860
on this guy for months now.

1052
00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:13.270
You mind taking that gun

1053
00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:13.270
out of my face?

1054
00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:15.360
Please. Really. It makes me nervous.

1055
00:53:15.490 --> 00:53:17.150
Let me see some credentials.

1056
00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:19.160
Yeah, sure.

1057
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:22.910
Take my whole wallet.

1058
00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:26.450
You want my gun, too?

1059
00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:26.450
Come over here, take my gun.

1060
00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:31.330
Just do me a favour, take a look outside.

1061
00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:31.330
Look out the window.

1062
00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:34.550
My partner's walking him to the car

1063
00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:34.550
as we speak. Look.

1064
00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:40.340
Old guy almost pissed in his pants

1065
00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:40.340
when I came through the door.

1066
00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:43.930
He jumped right through the window

1067
00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:43.930
onto the hood of my car.

1068
00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:45.720
Murph?

1069
00:53:45.810 --> 00:53:49.770
Call the LAPD. I don't want

1070
00:53:45.810 --> 00:53:49.770
people walking through my crime scene.

1071
00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:54.690
I didn't expect

1072
00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:54.690
the Secret Service on this.

1073
00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:57.650
Don't worry about it. What's your name?

1074
00:53:58.190 --> 00:54:00.610
Hanratty, Carl Hanratty.

1075
00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:08.790
Mind if I see some identification?

1076
00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:12.540
You never can be

1077
00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:12.540
too careful these days.

1078
00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:15.380
Well, tough luck, Carl.

1079
00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:18.090
Five minutes earlier, you would've

1080
00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:18.090
landed yourself a pretty good collar.

1081
00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:21.090
Is that right? Ten seconds later,

1082
00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:21.090
you'd have been shot.

1083
00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:25.640
Mind if I come downstairs with you?

1084
00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:25.640
I got to take a look at this guy.

1085
00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:28.180
Sure thing. Just do me a favour

1086
00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:28.180
and sit tight for a sec

1087
00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:29.890
while I get this evidence downstairs.

1088
00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:33.020
I don't want some maid walking

1089
00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:33.020
through here and making the bed.

1090
00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:35.690
-LAPD should be here any sec.

1091
00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:35.690
-Wait.

1092
00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:41.490
Your wallet.

1093
00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:45.200
You hang onto it for a minute.

1094
00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:45.200
I trust you.

1095
00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:06.430
Secret Service.

1096
00:55:50.970 --> 00:55:52.430
God damn it!

1097
00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:56.770
It was stupid. I made a stupid mistake.

1098
00:55:57.610 --> 00:55:58.900
Forget about it.

1099
00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:01.530
There are hundreds

1100
00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:01.530
of unknown subjects out there.

1101
00:56:01.610 --> 00:56:05.860
I can get this guy. The worst thing

1102
00:56:01.610 --> 00:56:05.860
a paperhanger can do is show his face.

1103
00:56:05.950 --> 00:56:07.280
I read the report.

1104
00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:11.040
Six feet tall, brown hair,

1105
00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:11.040
27 to 30 years of age, 160 pounds.

1106
00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:12.700
This could be almost anybody.

1107
00:56:12.790 --> 00:56:14.870
I heard his voice. I saw his face.

1108
00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:16.920
There's nothing for him

1109
00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:16.920
to hide behind any more.

1110
00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:19.670
Just be careful.

1111
00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:21.800
You got 12 years in.

1112
00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:23.590
Nobody bothers you down

1113
00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:23.590
on the first floor.

1114
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:25.430
You practically wrote

1115
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:25.430
the book on bank fraud.

1116
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:28.600
That's the kind of thing that can

1117
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:28.600
make you section chief someday.

1118
00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:31.970
Just don't put yourself

1119
00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:31.970
in this type of position.

1120
00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:33.430
What type of position?

1121
00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:37.650
The position of being humiliated.

1122
00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:48.700
Sean, would you like to hear me

1123
00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:48.700
tell a joke?

1124
00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:51.370
Yeah. Sure.

1125
00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:54.080
Knock, knock.

1126
00:56:56.870 --> 00:57:01.380
My next question is, when a pilot retires,

1127
00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:04.800
Pan Am sends them a cheque

1128
00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:04.800
every single month?

1129
00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:07.630
Yeah, pension programme

1130
00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:07.630
sends a cheque and benefits.

1131
00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:09.180
How much is that cheque for?

1132
00:57:09.590 --> 00:57:11.260
Kid, I'm really not in the mood

1133
00:57:09.590 --> 00:57:11.260
for this right now.

1134
00:57:11.350 --> 00:57:13.310
This Skywayman's driving me crazy.

1135
00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:14.600
Who's the Skywayman?

1136
00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:17.770
Some nut flying around the country,

1137
00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:17.770
posing as a Pan Am pilot.

1138
00:57:17.850 --> 00:57:20.690
There's a column about him

1139
00:57:17.850 --> 00:57:20.690
in the paper today.

1140
00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:30.950
I keep telling them it's not my problem.

1141
00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:30.950
This guy doesn't even fly Pan Am.

1142
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:34.080
Flies everybody else.

1143
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:34.080
Flies United, TWA,

1144
00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:35.870
Continental, Eastern.

1145
00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:37.910
The Skywayman.

1146
00:57:38.410 --> 00:57:40.580
Newspaper loves this clown.

1147
00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:43.540
They call him the James Bond

1148
00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:43.540
of the sky.

1149
00:57:46.550 --> 00:57:47.550
Did you say...

1150
00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:49.260
Bond, James Bond.

1151
00:57:58.940 --> 00:58:01.440
Tell me, Joan, why does he do it?

1152
00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:03.060
He likes to win.

1153
00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:05.440
We'll be landing in 20 minutes.

1154
00:58:05.570 --> 00:58:08.360
Do you want to play it easy,

1155
00:58:05.570 --> 00:58:08.360
or the hard way?

1156
00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:10.150
And this isn't a tranquiliser.

1157
00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:13.280
Pussy, you know a lot more

1158
00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:13.280
about planes than guns.

1159
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:15.490
Hello, Pussy.

1160
00:58:16.410 --> 00:58:18.370
You're sure this is the suit, right?

1161
00:58:18.450 --> 00:58:19.620
Positive.

1162
00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:21.830
It's the exact suit he wore in the movie.

1163
00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:24.170
Okay. I'll take three.

1164
00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:25.960
Certainly, Mr Fleming.

1165
00:58:26.090 --> 00:58:30.300
Now all you need is one of those

1166
00:58:26.090 --> 00:58:30.300
little foreign sports cars that he drives.

1167
00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:59.450
-Hello.

1168
00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:59.450
-Hi.

1169
00:59:03.330 --> 00:59:05.250
Haven't I seen you before?

1170
00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:09.090
Maybe.

1171
00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:12.800
A couple of years ago,

1172
00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:12.800
I was on the cover of Seventeen.

1173
00:59:15.090 --> 00:59:17.600
You're that model, right? Cheryl.

1174
00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:21.480
Guys used to put your picture

1175
00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:21.480
on their lockers.

1176
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:26.150
Isn't that your silver car

1177
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:26.150
I saw parked out front?

1178
00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:28.650
Yeah. One of them.

1179
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:35.620
So, think I could get an autograph?

1180
00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:42.000
Do you have a pen in your room?

1181
01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:23.540
A man like you can buy

1182
01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:23.540
anything he wants.

1183
01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:38.390
He buys a deck of cards

1184
01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:38.390
at the hotel gift shop.

1185
01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:43.560
You want to see a card trick?

1186
01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:47.190
How much did these cards cost?

1187
01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:51.400
I don't know, 55 cents, I think.

1188
01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:58.740
And if they sold me downstairs

1189
01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:58.740
at the hotel gift shop,

1190
01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.740
how much would you pay?

1191
01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:08.540
I'm sorry, how much would

1192
01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:08.540
I pay for what?

1193
01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:13.090
The entire night.

1194
01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:18.590
How much would you pay me

1195
01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:18.590
for the entire night?

1196
01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:25.930
Cheryl, I really don't know.

1197
01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:29.770
Don't be scared.

1198
01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:35.990
Make me an offer.

1199
01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:45.120
300?

1200
01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:47.960
Go fish.

1201
01:01:51.830 --> 01:01:53.460
$500?

1202
01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:55.460
Go fish.

1203
01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.300
600.

1204
01:02:00.130 --> 01:02:01.430
Go fish!

1205
01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:06.100
$1,000.

1206
01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:09.810
Okay.

1207
01:02:11.810 --> 01:02:13.650
$1,000.

1208
01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:16.650
Okay.

1209
01:02:17.490 --> 01:02:19.030
I'll be right back.

1210
01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:21.450
Wait a second, where are you going?

1211
01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:23.990
I'm going downstairs to cash a cheque.

1212
01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:28.830
You think this hotel is going to cash

1213
01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:28.830
a $1,000 cheque at 3:00 a.m.?

1214
01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:35.670
It's a New York Savings and Loan

1215
01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:35.670
cheque. It's like gold. They'll cash it.

1216
01:02:36.090 --> 01:02:39.550
Don't you think they might get

1217
01:02:36.090 --> 01:02:39.550
a little suspicious? Let me see that.

1218
01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:44.760
It's a cashier's cheque.

1219
01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:44.760
Endorse it over to me.

1220
01:02:44.850 --> 01:02:46.350
I couldn't do that.

1221
01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:49.850
This cheque is for 1,400.

1222
01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:49.850
We agreed upon 1,000.

1223
01:02:51.310 --> 01:02:54.020
Why don't I give you back 400

1224
01:02:54.810 --> 01:02:56.980
and you give me that cheque?

1225
01:02:58.320 --> 01:02:59.690
Even better.

1226
01:03:31.730 --> 01:03:33.690
Does this belong to anybody?

1227
01:03:50.370 --> 01:03:52.250
This is Hanratty. Merry Christmas.

1228
01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:53.750
Hello, Carl.

1229
01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:55.670
Hello.

1230
01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:00.250
Barry Allen, Secret Service.

1231
01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:05.010
I've been trying to track you down now

1232
01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:05.010
for the last couple of hours.

1233
01:04:05.130 --> 01:04:06.260
What do you want?

1234
01:04:07.090 --> 01:04:10.770
I wanted to apologise

1235
01:04:07.090 --> 01:04:10.770
for what happened out in Los Angeles.

1236
01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:14.270
No, you don't apologise to me.

1237
01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:17.230
Do you always work

1238
01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:17.230
on Christmas Eve, Carl?

1239
01:04:17.610 --> 01:04:19.520
I volunteered

1240
01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:21.730
so the men with families

1241
01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:21.730
could go home early.

1242
01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:24.820
Looked like you were wearing

1243
01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:24.820
a wedding ring out in Los Angeles.

1244
01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:26.700
I thought maybe you had a family.

1245
01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:28.530
No. No family.

1246
01:04:30.370 --> 01:04:34.000
You want to talk to me?

1247
01:04:30.370 --> 01:04:34.000
Let's talk face to face.

1248
01:04:34.290 --> 01:04:35.580
All right.

1249
01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:39.340
I'm at my suite

1250
01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:39.340
at the Stuyvesant Arms, room 3113.

1251
01:04:39.790 --> 01:04:42.920
In the morning, I leave for Las Vegas

1252
01:04:39.790 --> 01:04:42.920
for the weekend.

1253
01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:47.640
You think you're going to get me again?

1254
01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:51.890
You're not going to Vegas,

1255
01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:51.890
you're not in the Stuyvesant Arms.

1256
01:04:52.810 --> 01:04:57.940
You'd love for me to send out 20 agents,

1257
01:04:52.810 --> 01:04:57.940
Christmas Eve, barge into your hotel,

1258
01:04:58.230 --> 01:05:00.610
knock down the door

1259
01:04:58.230 --> 01:05:00.610
so you can make fools out of us all.

1260
01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:04.650
I'm really sorry if I made a fool

1261
01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:04.650
out of you. I really am.

1262
01:05:06.110 --> 01:05:09.120
No. You do not feel sorry for me.

1263
01:05:09.490 --> 01:05:13.830
The truth is, I knew it was you.

1264
01:05:09.490 --> 01:05:13.830
I didn't get the cuffs on you, but I knew.

1265
01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:17.830
People only know

1266
01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:17.830
what you tell them, Carl.

1267
01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:21.960
Then tell me this,

1268
01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:21.960
Barry Allen, Secret Service.

1269
01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:25.260
How did you know

1270
01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:25.260
I wouldn't look in your wallet?

1271
01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:28.340
The same reason

1272
01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:28.340
the Yankees always win.

1273
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:31.600
Nobody can keep their eyes

1274
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:31.600
off the pinstripes.

1275
01:05:31.850 --> 01:05:34.520
The Yankees win

1276
01:05:31.850 --> 01:05:34.520
because they have Mickey Mantle.

1277
01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.850
No one ever bets on the uniform.

1278
01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:39.650
You sure about that, Carl?

1279
01:05:39.810 --> 01:05:42.020
I'll tell you what I am sure of.

1280
01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:44.020
You're going to get caught.

1281
01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:48.320
One way or another,

1282
01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:48.320
it's a mathematical fact. It's like Vegas.

1283
01:05:48.450 --> 01:05:50.200
The house always wins.

1284
01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:59.170
Well, Carl, I'm sorry, but I have to go.

1285
01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:03.290
You didn't call just to apologise,

1286
01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:03.290
did you?

1287
01:06:04.550 --> 01:06:05.800
What do you mean?

1288
01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:09.590
You have no one else to call.

1289
01:06:47.090 --> 01:06:48.630
More coffee, sir?

1290
01:06:54.970 --> 01:06:57.770
-Are you a collector?

1291
01:06:54.970 --> 01:06:57.770
-Of what?

1292
01:06:57.850 --> 01:06:59.180
Captives of the Cosmic Ray,

1293
01:06:59.270 --> 01:07:01.230
The Big Freeze,

1294
01:06:59.270 --> 01:07:01.230
Land of the Golden Giants.

1295
01:07:01.310 --> 01:07:03.940
-I've got them all.

1296
01:07:01.310 --> 01:07:03.940
-What are you talking about?

1297
01:07:04.690 --> 01:07:05.940
Barry Allen.

1298
01:07:09.110 --> 01:07:10.150
The Flash.

1299
01:07:12.450 --> 01:07:13.780
Wait, kid.

1300
01:07:16.370 --> 01:07:17.990
You mean, like the comic book?

1301
01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:21.120
Yeah, the comic book. When he's not

1302
01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:21.120
The Flash, that's his name, Barry Allen.

1303
01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:24.330
Thank you.

1304
01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:31.090
Now get this, he reads comic books!

1305
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:33.880
Comic books! Barry Allen is The Flash!

1306
01:07:33.970 --> 01:07:36.050
Carl, slow down. I don't know

1307
01:07:33.970 --> 01:07:36.050
what the hell you're talking about.

1308
01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:38.220
He's a kid. Our unsub is a kid.

1309
01:07:38.310 --> 01:07:41.230
That's why we couldn't match his prints,

1310
01:07:38.310 --> 01:07:41.230
that's why he doesn't have a record.

1311
01:07:41.310 --> 01:07:43.390
I want you to contact NYPD for every

1312
01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:46.270
all-points juvenile runaways

1313
01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:46.270
in New York City.

1314
01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:49.780
Don't forget the airports. He's been

1315
01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:49.780
kiting cheques all over the country.

1316
01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:51.940
-Why New York?

1317
01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:51.940
-The Yankees!

1318
01:07:52.030 --> 01:07:54.490
He said something about the Yankees!

1319
01:07:57.030 --> 01:07:58.490
Where are we on the list?

1320
01:07:58.580 --> 01:08:01.120
Number 53, Abagnale.

1321
01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:06.960
Good morning, ma'am,

1322
01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:06.960
we're the F.B.I. agents who called.

1323
01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.170
Yes, I've been waiting.

1324
01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:11.840
I hope you're all hungry.

1325
01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:11.840
I put out the Sara Lee.

1326
01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:17.260
My husband, Jack, is a lawyer.

1327
01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:19.970
What about your first husband,

1328
01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:19.970
Mrs Abagnale?

1329
01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:23.680
Abagnale. But I prefer

1330
01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:23.680
to be called Barnes.

1331
01:08:25.690 --> 01:08:28.770
"Frank William Abagnale."

1332
01:08:25.690 --> 01:08:28.770
It says he was in the service.

1333
01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:30.940
Did you two meet during the war?

1334
01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:35.740
Yeah, I lived in a very small village

1335
01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:35.740
in France, Montrichard.

1336
01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:39.660
The kind of place

1337
01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:39.660
where they never heard of Sara Lee.

1338
01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.620
Help yourselves.

1339
01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:43.540
Nobody doesn't like Sara Lee.

1340
01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:45.120
You filled out a missing person's report

1341
01:08:45.210 --> 01:08:48.670
for a runaway juvenile by the name of

1342
01:08:45.210 --> 01:08:48.670
Frank Abagnale, Jr.

1343
01:08:49.210 --> 01:08:50.460
Is Frankie okay?

1344
01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:52.960
You're aware of the fact that

1345
01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:52.960
he wrote some cheques

1346
01:08:53.050 --> 01:08:55.260
on a closed account

1347
01:08:53.050 --> 01:08:55.260
at Chase Manhattan Bank?

1348
01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:58.800
Yes. The police think

1349
01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:58.800
he's some type of criminal.

1350
01:08:58.890 --> 01:09:01.350
What he did was a felony, Mrs Barnes.

1351
01:09:01.890 --> 01:09:03.520
It was $1,000.

1352
01:09:04.270 --> 01:09:08.100
Half the kids his age are on dope,

1353
01:09:04.270 --> 01:09:08.100
throwing rocks at police.

1354
01:09:08.850 --> 01:09:13.070
And they scared me to death

1355
01:09:08.850 --> 01:09:13.070
because my son made a little mistake.

1356
01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:17.110
A 17-year-old boy has to eat,

1357
01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:19.240
has to have a place to sleep.

1358
01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:21.370
We understand, ma'am.

1359
01:09:22.030 --> 01:09:23.580
Would you happen to have a picture

1360
01:09:22.030 --> 01:09:23.580
of your son?

1361
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:25.580
Yes, I have his old yearbook.

1362
01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:36.340
Okay.

1363
01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:41.350
We need to send out

1364
01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:41.350
an all-office teletype.

1365
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:44.930
Our unsub's name

1366
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:44.930
is Frank Abagnale, Jr., age 17!

1367
01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:47.270
Is Frankie okay? Is he in trouble?

1368
01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:50.230
Ma'am, I'm sorry to have to tell you,

1369
01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:50.230
your son is forging checks.

1370
01:09:50.310 --> 01:09:53.320
Forging checks? Wait!

1371
01:09:50.310 --> 01:09:53.320
I'm sure we can take care of that.

1372
01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:55.400
I'm working part-time at the church now.

1373
01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:57.990
Just tell me how much he owes

1374
01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:57.990
and I'll pay you back.

1375
01:09:58.070 --> 01:10:00.410
So far, it's about $1.3 million.

1376
01:10:17.970 --> 01:10:19.550
Hi, Melanie, how are you?

1377
01:10:19.630 --> 01:10:22.140
When you're in the house,

1378
01:10:19.630 --> 01:10:22.140
please use an ashtray.

1379
01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:23.970
Frank, this fondue is so good!

1380
01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:26.930
-Great. Take this.

1381
01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:26.930
-Good, I love Moët!

1382
01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:39.490
James, please! Stay away

1383
01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:39.490
from the hi-fi system, all right?

1384
01:10:39.570 --> 01:10:42.490
It's a reel-to-reel,

1385
01:10:39.570 --> 01:10:42.490
you can't wind it like that.

1386
01:10:45.490 --> 01:10:48.580
Christ, Terry! This is Italian knit!

1387
01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:51.290
-Watch where you're going!

1388
01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:51.290
-It's just a shirt, man!

1389
01:10:51.370 --> 01:10:53.380
Frank! Come quick!

1390
01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:57.300
Lance just fell into the conversation pit!

1391
01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:05.430
Excuse me,

1392
01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:05.430
you know where Lance Applebaum is?

1393
01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:06.640
Thank you.

1394
01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:09.850
These bottles need to be labelled

1395
01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:09.850
when you pick them up!

1396
01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:12.230
Do you understand

1397
01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:12.230
how dangerous this is? Do you?

1398
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:15.560
Don't stand there crying. Nod your head.

1399
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:15.560
Tell me you won't do it again.

1400
01:11:15.650 --> 01:11:17.780
Now dry up and get back to work.

1401
01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:25.370
You okay?

1402
01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:28.830
He told me to pick up the blood, so I did.

1403
01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:31.080
But he never told me to label it.

1404
01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:34.460
It's okay, stop crying.

1405
01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:36.290
What's your name?

1406
01:11:37.250 --> 01:11:38.550
Brenda.

1407
01:11:41.170 --> 01:11:43.340
Brenda, I wouldn't worry about it.

1408
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:45.840
These doctors don't know everything.

1409
01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:48.390
It's my first week.

1410
01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:50.520
I think they're going to fire me.

1411
01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:53.520
No, nobody's going to fire you, Brenda.

1412
01:11:53.890 --> 01:11:55.900
I bet you're good at your job.

1413
01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:58.520
No, I'm not.

1414
01:11:59.570 --> 01:12:01.990
I bet if I asked you to check

1415
01:11:59.570 --> 01:12:01.990
on the status

1416
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:03.780
of my friend Lance Applebaum,

1417
01:12:04.610 --> 01:12:07.320
you could do that for me in a second.

1418
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:17.750
Mr Applebaum fractured his ankle.

1419
01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:21.550
Dr Ashland is treating him

1420
01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:21.550
in exam room seven.

1421
01:12:21.630 --> 01:12:24.090
You see that? No problem.

1422
01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:28.550
This is the emergency chart.

1423
01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:33.020
See that blue star? That means

1424
01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:33.020
the patient has been diagnosed.

1425
01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:37.560
And then after he's been treated,

1426
01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:37.560
we put a red circle here. See?

1427
01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:41.190
How do you like those braces?

1428
01:12:42.650 --> 01:12:44.240
I guess they're all right.

1429
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:47.070
I got mine off last year.

1430
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:50.620
Boy, I hated them. They were bottoms.

1431
01:12:50.830 --> 01:12:53.040
I still got to wear my mouth guard.

1432
01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:55.750
You have really nice teeth.

1433
01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:59.250
Well, thank you.

1434
01:12:59.630 --> 01:13:01.880
And you have a pretty smile.

1435
01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:09.340
No, I mean it. I really think

1436
01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:09.340
those braces look good on you.

1437
01:13:09.550 --> 01:13:10.970
Thank you.

1438
01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:12.470
You're welcome.

1439
01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:17.190
Brenda.

1440
01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:18.690
Yeah.

1441
01:13:18.850 --> 01:13:21.650
Do you know if they're hiring here

1442
01:13:18.850 --> 01:13:21.650
at the hospital?

1443
01:13:23.150 --> 01:13:25.860
I'm not sure. What do you want to do?

1444
01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:29.360
I'm a doctor.

1445
01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:34.830
Dear Dad,

1446
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:37.620
I decided to get off the road for a while.

1447
01:13:37.710 --> 01:13:41.630
I've taken a night job at a hospital

1448
01:13:37.710 --> 01:13:41.630
and met some really nice people.

1449
01:13:41.710 --> 01:13:43.420
Feels good to have

1450
01:13:41.710 --> 01:13:43.420
my feet on the ground,

1451
01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:45.670
to wake up in the same bed every night.

1452
01:13:47.050 --> 01:13:50.840
Who knows, maybe I'll even find

1453
01:13:47.050 --> 01:13:50.840
someone to settle down with.

1454
01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:56.770
"Harvard Medical School."

1455
01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:56.770
Top of your class.

1456
01:13:57.850 --> 01:14:00.600
"Southern California

1457
01:13:57.850 --> 01:14:00.600
Children's Hospital."

1458
01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:04.440
That is a pretty impressive résumé,

1459
01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:04.440
Dr Conners.

1460
01:14:04.730 --> 01:14:06.400
Unfortunately,

1461
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:09.110
the only thing I need is

1462
01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:13.490
an emergency room supervisor

1463
01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:13.490
for my midnight to 8:00 a.m. shift.

1464
01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:17.870
Someone to babysit

1465
01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:17.870
six interns and 20 nurses.

1466
01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:20.370
But...

1467
01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:25.380
Hell, I doubt that you'd be interested

1468
01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:25.380
in that.

1469
01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:31.390
In the past, they've always

1470
01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:31.390
let me choose my own nurses.

1471
01:14:32.930 --> 01:14:34.220
Dr Connelly.

1472
01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:37.310
-Dr Harris.

1473
01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:37.310
-Present.

1474
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:39.560
Dr Ashland.

1475
01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:41.060
Dr Conners?

1476
01:14:41.770 --> 01:14:43.730
You gonna take roll every night?

1477
01:14:43.810 --> 01:14:45.770
Yes, I will, Dr Ashland.

1478
01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:49.190
And if you're going to be late,

1479
01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:49.190
I suggest you bring a note.

1480
01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:54.240
Miss Basmann.

1481
01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:56.160
Miss Mace.

1482
01:14:56.830 --> 01:14:58.330
Miss Strong.

1483
01:14:58.580 --> 01:14:59.660
Here.

1484
01:14:59.750 --> 01:15:01.080
Nurse Brown.

1485
01:15:02.250 --> 01:15:03.580
Nurse Sanford.

1486
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.550
Thirty milligrams of codeine

1487
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.550
every four hours.

1488
01:15:06.630 --> 01:15:10.470
Run the plasma at 60 drops a minute

1489
01:15:06.630 --> 01:15:10.470
till we calculate the fluid requirements.

1490
01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:14.140
What do you estimate the degree

1491
01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:14.140
and extent of the burns, Kildare?

1492
01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:17.430
Second and third-degree burns

1493
01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:17.430
over about 20% of the body surface.

1494
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:18.890
-Do you concur?

1495
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:18.890
-I concur.

1496
01:15:18.970 --> 01:15:20.430
Let's get him up to Paediatrics.

1497
01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:28.780
Hello, Brenda.

1498
01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:30.280
Hi, Dr Conners.

1499
01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:33.530
-You need to sign these.

1500
01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:33.530
-Thank you.

1501
01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:42.660
Do you notice anything different

1502
01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:42.660
about me?

1503
01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:44.920
You got your braces off! Come here.

1504
01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.500
I've been trying to show you all night!

1505
01:15:50.210 --> 01:15:51.550
Good job.

1506
01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:54.470
Did it hurt when they took them off?

1507
01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:54.470
Mine felt so weird after.

1508
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:57.470
I keep rubbing my tongue over them.

1509
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:57.470
I can't stop!

1510
01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:59.060
They're so slippery.

1511
01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:02.310
-It feels good, doesn't it?

1512
01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:02.310
-Yeah, it feels incredible.

1513
01:16:12.570 --> 01:16:13.900
Oh, my!

1514
01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:16.660
I'm sorry.

1515
01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:31.800
Dr Conners to the E.R.

1516
01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.010
Shouldn't you go?

1517
01:16:33.090 --> 01:16:37.720
No. They have a staff doctor

1518
01:16:33.090 --> 01:16:37.720
in the emergency ward, we'll be fine.

1519
01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:45.940
What if he's in surgery?

1520
01:16:47.850 --> 01:16:49.440
Do you really think I have to go?

1521
01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:51.780
In here, Dr Conners.

1522
01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:12.380
Gentlemen, what seems

1523
01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:12.380
to be the problem?

1524
01:17:13.090 --> 01:17:17.630
Bicycle accident. A fractured tibia

1525
01:17:13.090 --> 01:17:17.630
about five inches below the patella.

1526
01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:24.220
Dr Harris.

1527
01:17:24.810 --> 01:17:26.390
Do you concur?

1528
01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:28.980
Concur with what, sir?

1529
01:17:29.650 --> 01:17:32.820
With what Dr Ashland just said.

1530
01:17:29.650 --> 01:17:32.820
Do you concur?

1531
01:17:34.990 --> 01:17:37.900
Well, it was a bicycle accident.

1532
01:17:34.990 --> 01:17:37.900
The boy told us.

1533
01:17:38.990 --> 01:17:40.280
So you concur?

1534
01:17:41.950 --> 01:17:45.620
We should take an X-ray, stitch him up

1535
01:17:41.950 --> 01:17:45.620
and put him in a walking cast.

1536
01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:51.380
Very good, Dr Ashland. Very good.

1537
01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:54.420
Well, you don't seem

1538
01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:54.420
to have much need for me.

1539
01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:55.760
Carry on.

1540
01:17:58.180 --> 01:17:59.970
I blew it, didn't I?

1541
01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:02.600
Why didn't I concur?

1542
01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:26.330
Make yourself at home!

1543
01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:29.160
Frank Abagnale, Sr.

1544
01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:31.040
You're not a cop.

1545
01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:34.790
Special Agent Hanratty, F.B.I.

1546
01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:38.510
You're not a cop.

1547
01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:38.510
My landlord said you were not a cop.

1548
01:18:38.970 --> 01:18:42.590
If you're going to arrest me,

1549
01:18:38.970 --> 01:18:42.590
I'd like to put on a different suit.

1550
01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:44.970
-If that's okay...

1551
01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:44.970
-I'm not here to arrest you.

1552
01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:47.350
I'm looking for your son. He's in trouble.

1553
01:18:47.470 --> 01:18:49.140
Do you know where he is?

1554
01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:54.940
If I tell you where he is,

1555
01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:54.940
will you promise not to tell his mother?

1556
01:18:55.020 --> 01:18:56.110
Sure.

1557
01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:01.400
Frank made up a fake I.D.

1558
01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:01.400
and enlisted in the Marine Corps.

1559
01:19:01.490 --> 01:19:03.570
He's over in Vietnam right now.

1560
01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:05.740
That kid is halfway around the world,

1561
01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:09.870
crawling through the damn jungle,

1562
01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:09.870
fighting the communists, so...

1563
01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:15.340
Please, don't come to my home

1564
01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:15.340
and call my boy a criminal...

1565
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:19.340
I never said he was a criminal,

1566
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:19.340
Mr Abagnale. I said he was in trouble.

1567
01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:24.140
If you'd like to give me a call and talk,

1568
01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:24.140
here's my number.

1569
01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:38.530
You're not a father, are you?

1570
01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:41.740
Pardon me?

1571
01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:44.160
If you were a father, you'd know.

1572
01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:49.700
I would never give up my son.

1573
01:19:51.710 --> 01:19:53.750
Yes, sir. I understand.

1574
01:19:54.710 --> 01:19:56.540
Sean, now get this.

1575
01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:01.720
"Riverbend Apartments, 415 Landover,

1576
01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:01.720
Atlanta, Georgia."

1577
01:20:02.170 --> 01:20:03.840
Atlanta, Georgia.

1578
01:20:03.930 --> 01:20:08.640
I'm on my way to the airport. I'll meet

1579
01:20:03.930 --> 01:20:08.640
the team in four hours. Bye-bye!

1580
01:20:10.890 --> 01:20:13.140
Come on, it's okay.

1581
01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:15.730
You don't have to cry.

1582
01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:20.480
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry, Frank!

1583
01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:20.480
I can't do this.

1584
01:20:20.570 --> 01:20:22.240
Brenda, listen to me.

1585
01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:25.360
I don't care if you're a virgin, all right?

1586
01:20:25.450 --> 01:20:26.700
Really, I can wait.

1587
01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:29.620
I'm not a virgin.

1588
01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:36.500
I had an abortion two years ago.

1589
01:20:40.090 --> 01:20:42.590
My parents had a friend do it.

1590
01:20:43.090 --> 01:20:46.300
A man that my father plays golf with.

1591
01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:51.010
And when I got better,

1592
01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:51.010
they kicked me out of the house.

1593
01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:55.480
I had an abortion

1594
01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:55.480
and I wasn't their daughter any more!

1595
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:59.270
I'm so sorry. Please don't be mad at me.

1596
01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:02.110
No, no.

1597
01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:04.440
Please don't be mad at me.

1598
01:21:06.450 --> 01:21:08.950
What if I spoke to your parents?

1599
01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:11.280
Maybe I can straighten things out.

1600
01:21:11.370 --> 01:21:14.950
I ask them all the time,

1601
01:21:11.370 --> 01:21:14.950
but they said I still can't come home.

1602
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:18.960
And my daddy's a lawyer.

1603
01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:28.510
Brenda?

1604
01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:33.850
What if you were engaged to a doctor?

1605
01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:36.390
Would that change anything?

1606
01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:37.730
What?

1607
01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:44.030
What if I went to your parents,

1608
01:21:45.490 --> 01:21:47.820
and I spoke to your father

1609
01:21:51.070 --> 01:21:53.700
and I asked permission to marry you?

1610
01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:09.840
-It's empty.

1611
01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:09.840
-Nobody here.

1612
01:22:33.870 --> 01:22:36.200
Dr Conners, are you Lutheran?

1613
01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:39.460
Yes, I am a Lutheran.

1614
01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:41.710
But please, call me Frank.

1615
01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:45.710
Frank, would you like to say grace?

1616
01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:53.550
Unless you're not comfortable.

1617
01:22:53.890 --> 01:22:55.310
Absolutely.

1618
01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:08.900
Two little mice fell

1619
01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:08.900
into a bucket of cream.

1620
01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:12.820
The first mouse

1621
01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:12.820
quickly gave up and drowned,

1622
01:23:12.910 --> 01:23:14.740
but the second mouse struggled so hard

1623
01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:17.450
that he eventually churned

1624
01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:17.450
that cream into butter,

1625
01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:19.700
and he walked out.

1626
01:23:21.250 --> 01:23:22.250
Amen.

1627
01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:26.920
That was beautiful.

1628
01:23:27.250 --> 01:23:29.590
The mouse churned

1629
01:23:27.250 --> 01:23:29.590
that cream into butter.

1630
01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:33.970
That's right.

1631
01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:36.720
Thank you.

1632
01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:39.930
Frank, have you decided which hospital

1633
01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:39.930
you want to work at in New Orleans?

1634
01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:45.560
To be quite honest,

1635
01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:45.560
I'm thinking about getting back into law.

1636
01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:49.110
Oh, my! Are you a doctor or a lawyer?

1637
01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:53.360
Before I went to medical school,

1638
01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:53.360
I passed the bar in California.

1639
01:23:53.450 --> 01:23:56.200
I practised law for one year,

1640
01:23:53.450 --> 01:23:56.200
then I decided,

1641
01:23:56.450 --> 01:23:58.990
why not try my hand at paediatrics?

1642
01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:02.330
You're just full of surprises.

1643
01:24:03.290 --> 01:24:04.500
Yeah.

1644
01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:08.880
A doctor and a lawyer.

1645
01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:08.880
Brenda hit the jackpot.

1646
01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:11.340
Where did you go to law school?

1647
01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:13.220
Berkeley.

1648
01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:17.680
Oh, my gosh.

1649
01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:17.680
Isn't that where you went, Daddy?

1650
01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.430
Maybe Frank could come

1651
01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.430
work for you, Roger.

1652
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:22.770
You're always saying how hard it is

1653
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:22.770
to find assistant prosecutors.

1654
01:24:22.850 --> 01:24:25.900
Could he, Daddy? Could he, please?

1655
01:24:22.850 --> 01:24:25.900
Could he come work with you, please?

1656
01:24:25.980 --> 01:24:27.560
Was that snake Hollingsworth

1657
01:24:27.650 --> 01:24:30.230
still teaching there

1658
01:24:27.650 --> 01:24:30.230
when you went through Berkeley?

1659
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:33.070
Hollingsworth.

1660
01:24:33.150 --> 01:24:35.490
Yes. Grumpy old Hollingsworth, right?

1661
01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:37.320
Meaner than ever.

1662
01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:39.700
And that dog of his?

1663
01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:46.040
Tell me, Frank,

1664
01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:46.040
what was the name of his little dog?

1665
01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:57.090
I'm sorry.

1666
01:24:58.930 --> 01:25:00.470
The dog was dead.

1667
01:25:03.730 --> 01:25:05.350
How unfortunate.

1668
01:25:06.770 --> 01:25:07.850
Yeah.

1669
01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:40.720
A doctor, a lawyer, a Lutheran.

1670
01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.640
So, what are you, Frank?

1671
01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:49.940
'Cause I think you're about to ask

1672
01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:49.940
for my daughter's hand in marriage,

1673
01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:51.520
and I have a right to know.

1674
01:25:52.110 --> 01:25:53.730
Know what, sir?

1675
01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:55.740
The truth.

1676
01:25:57.900 --> 01:25:59.950
Tell me the truth, Frank.

1677
01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:03.410
What are you doing here?

1678
01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:08.080
What is a man like you

1679
01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:08.080
doing with Brenda?

1680
01:26:09.670 --> 01:26:13.130
If you want my blessing,

1681
01:26:09.670 --> 01:26:13.130
if you want my daughter,

1682
01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:15.670
I'd like to hear it from you now.

1683
01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:20.180
The truth is, sir...

1684
01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:26.270
The truth is that...

1685
01:26:28.770 --> 01:26:31.310
I'm not a doctor, I'm not a lawyer.

1686
01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:35.980
I'm not an airline pilot.

1687
01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:39.780
I'm nothing, really.

1688
01:26:46.990 --> 01:26:50.120
I'm just a kid

1689
01:26:46.990 --> 01:26:50.120
who's in love with your daughter.

1690
01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:53.500
No.

1691
01:27:03.010 --> 01:27:04.970
You know what you are?

1692
01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:07.060
You're a romantic.

1693
01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:10.180
Men like us are nothing

1694
01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:10.180
without the women we love.

1695
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:13.900
I must confess,

1696
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:13.900
I'm guilty of the same foolish whimsy.

1697
01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:16.110
I proposed to Carol after five dates

1698
01:27:16.190 --> 01:27:18.990
with two nickels in my pockets

1699
01:27:16.190 --> 01:27:18.990
and holes in my shoes

1700
01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:20.990
because I knew she was the one.

1701
01:27:21.990 --> 01:27:23.740
So go ahead, Frank.

1702
01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:29.330
Don't be afraid.

1703
01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:32.500
Ask the question you came here

1704
01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:32.500
to ask me.

1705
01:27:37.670 --> 01:27:41.170
What would I have to do to take the bar

1706
01:27:37.670 --> 01:27:41.170
here in New Orleans?

1707
01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:48.100
No, the other question.

1708
01:27:53.350 --> 01:27:55.350
Right through that door.

1709
01:27:57.190 --> 01:27:59.110
Good luck, Mr Conners.

1710
01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:01.110
Thank you.

1711
01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:10.620
Hey, Frank.

1712
01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:13.410
You know what I could never figure out?

1713
01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:16.330
How did you cheat on the bar exam

1714
01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:16.330
in Louisiana?

1715
01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:18.040
What's the difference?

1716
01:28:18.130 --> 01:28:22.130
-Someone took the test for you?

1717
01:28:18.130 --> 01:28:22.130
-I'm going to prison for a long time.

1718
01:28:22.590 --> 01:28:25.090
Seriously, what's the difference?

1719
01:28:25.470 --> 01:28:27.470
It's a simple question.

1720
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:31.060
Are you going to eat that éclair?

1721
01:28:32.730 --> 01:28:35.390
Yeah. I'm saving it for later.

1722
01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:38.440
Or you want to split it with me?

1723
01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:39.610
No.

1724
01:28:43.110 --> 01:28:45.740
Give me half that éclair and I'll tell you.

1725
01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:59.170
I'm gonna figure it out sooner or later.

1726
01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:09.350
You'll be working under Phillip Rigby

1727
01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:09.350
in corporate law.

1728
01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:12.770
Why don't you settle in,

1729
01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:12.770
organise your desk?

1730
01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:17.440
We're having lunch at 12:30

1731
01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:21.900
with the Attorney General

1732
01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:21.900
and Governor McKeithen himself.

1733
01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:23.610
A governor!

1734
01:29:23.690 --> 01:29:25.320
Did we spell it right?

1735
01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:26.700
You sure did.

1736
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:28.530
Congratulations.

1737
01:29:28.610 --> 01:29:30.490
-Thank you, sir.

1738
01:29:28.610 --> 01:29:30.490
-Welcome aboard.

1739
01:29:38.210 --> 01:29:40.960
Look at this photograph, Mr Stewart.

1740
01:29:41.290 --> 01:29:45.300
It's a photograph of Prentice York,

1741
01:29:41.290 --> 01:29:45.300
where they found him, dead.

1742
01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:48.630
Here is an enlargement

1743
01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:48.630
of part of that photograph.

1744
01:29:49.010 --> 01:29:52.640
This is a photograph of the defendant's

1745
01:29:49.010 --> 01:29:52.640
signature on a canceled cheque.

1746
01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:56.640
Here is an enlargement of that

1747
01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:56.640
same signature, which matches

1748
01:29:56.890 --> 01:29:59.900
the signature on the letters

1749
01:29:56.890 --> 01:29:59.900
that he wrote to Mrs Simon,

1750
01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:04.190
which discuss the possibility of

1751
01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:04.190
defrauding the great state of Louisiana.

1752
01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:07.150
Your Honour,

1753
01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:07.150
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

1754
01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:11.530
this is irrefutable evidence

1755
01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:11.530
that the defendant is, in fact, lying.

1756
01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:21.460
Mr Conners,

1757
01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:21.460
this is a preliminary hearing.

1758
01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:24.840
There is no defendant.

1759
01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:29.720
There is no jury.

1760
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:32.760
It's just me.

1761
01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:35.260
Son,

1762
01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:38.100
what in the hell is wrong with you?

1763
01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:41.850
Is that Mitch? Roger!

1764
01:30:42.690 --> 01:30:43.940
It's Mitch!

1765
01:30:44.110 --> 01:30:45.940
I lost all track of time.

1766
01:30:46.030 --> 01:30:48.360
As studio guests

1767
01:30:46.030 --> 01:30:48.360
for the sing-along tonight,

1768
01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:49.490
we have the children's choir

1769
01:30:49.570 --> 01:30:51.950
of Saint Monica's Church

1770
01:30:49.570 --> 01:30:51.950
in New York City.

1771
01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:56.120
Won't you join them and the gang

1772
01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:56.120
in a few songs for the Irish? Everybody!

1773
01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:28.090
Dad?

1774
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:34.220
What are you doing here?

1775
01:32:36.220 --> 01:32:37.970
I came to see you.

1776
01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:44.060
What are you doing dressed like this?

1777
01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:46.100
I took a government job.

1778
01:32:46.230 --> 01:32:49.610
You see what I'm doing?

1779
01:32:46.230 --> 01:32:49.610
Do you have a good lawyer?

1780
01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:52.360
I sort of am a lawyer now.

1781
01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:54.990
Look at this letter. The IRS wants more.

1782
01:32:55.950 --> 01:32:58.490
I had a deal with them. Two penalties.

1783
01:32:58.570 --> 01:33:01.240
They ate the cake,

1784
01:32:58.570 --> 01:33:01.240
now they want the crumbs.

1785
01:33:01.950 --> 01:33:03.580
I want to sue them.

1786
01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:06.830
Now they want the crumbs.

1787
01:33:08.580 --> 01:33:09.840
Sit down.

1788
01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:13.170
They're trying to scare me,

1789
01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:13.170
intimidate me. You know what?

1790
01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:16.220
You know what?

1791
01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:18.340
I'll make them chase me

1792
01:33:18.930 --> 01:33:21.180
for the rest of their lives!

1793
01:33:28.150 --> 01:33:30.230
It's great to see you, Daddy.

1794
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:34.490
Sit down, I want to show you something.

1795
01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:39.200
I came here to give you this.

1796
01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:42.240
It's an invitation to an engagement party.

1797
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.210
Daddy, I'm getting married.

1798
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.210
Can you believe that

1799
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.210
I'm getting married?

1800
01:33:50.290 --> 01:33:53.590
You don't need to worry

1801
01:33:50.290 --> 01:33:53.590
about anything now, Dad. Listen.

1802
01:33:53.670 --> 01:33:57.300
I'm getting a brand-new Cadillac,

1803
01:33:53.670 --> 01:33:57.300
I'm getting a $60,000 house,

1804
01:33:57.380 --> 01:33:59.090
I'm getting it all back.

1805
01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:03.970
All the jewellery, the furs, everything

1806
01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:03.970
they took from us, I'll get it back.

1807
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:09.310
Has Ma seen you dressed like this?

1808
01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:13.110
Yeah, she came to pick up some boxes.

1809
01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:15.320
That's okay. You know why?

1810
01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:17.740
Because she's going to the wedding

1811
01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:17.740
with us.

1812
01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:20.200
I'm gonna get you

1813
01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:20.200
a brand-new suit, Dad.

1814
01:34:20.660 --> 01:34:23.160
One of those Manhattan Eagle,

1815
01:34:20.660 --> 01:34:23.160
three-button black pearl suits.

1816
01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:24.330
You'll look great.

1817
01:34:24.410 --> 01:34:26.910
Those are nice. She won't see me.

1818
01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:31.670
Have you tried to call her?

1819
01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:35.960
Why don't you call her right now?

1820
01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:38.260
Why don't you call her right now?

1821
01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:40.050
Dad, just call her.

1822
01:34:40.130 --> 01:34:41.680
Call her for me.

1823
01:34:41.930 --> 01:34:45.640
Tell her I have two first-class tickets

1824
01:34:41.930 --> 01:34:45.640
to go see her son's wedding...

1825
01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:47.600
You mother's married now

1826
01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:47.600
to my friend, Jack Barnes.

1827
01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:50.440
They have a house in Long Island.

1828
01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:54.270
I had an F.B.I. agent come see me.

1829
01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:58.820
You got their number, son.

1830
01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:58.820
The guy looked scared.

1831
01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:03.160
The United States Government, champ,

1832
01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:03.160
running for the hills.

1833
01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:05.580
To the moon!

1834
01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:20.630
It's over.

1835
01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:23.180
I'm going to stop now.

1836
01:35:26.350 --> 01:35:28.140
They're never gonna catch you, Frank.

1837
01:35:28.220 --> 01:35:31.690
She wouldn't do that!

1838
01:35:28.220 --> 01:35:31.690
Why would she do that to you?

1839
01:35:31.850 --> 01:35:34.770
Come on. Sit with me. Have a drink.

1840
01:35:31.850 --> 01:35:34.770
I'm your father.

1841
01:35:36.230 --> 01:35:40.440
Then ask me to stop.

1842
01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:45.370
You can't stop.

1843
01:35:47.950 --> 01:35:49.950
Where are you going?

1844
01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:52.370
Come on, Frank, where are you going?

1845
01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:55.080
Where are you going?

1846
01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:55.080
Where are you going tonight?

1847
01:35:55.420 --> 01:35:56.790
Someplace exotic?

1848
01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:59.510
Where are you going tonight?

1849
01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:59.510
Tahiti? Hawaii?

1850
01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:18.610
This is Hanratty.

1851
01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:21.400
Hello, Carl.

1852
01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:23.490
Merry Christmas.

1853
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:25.860
How are you, Dr Conners?

1854
01:36:26.370 --> 01:36:29.490
Carl, I haven't been Dr Conners

1855
01:36:26.370 --> 01:36:29.490
for months now.

1856
01:36:32.910 --> 01:36:34.120
Well,

1857
01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:37.170
I'm sitting here in my office

1858
01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:37.170
on Christmas Eve.

1859
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.630
What do you want?

1860
01:36:45.130 --> 01:36:46.340
Okay.

1861
01:36:50.890 --> 01:36:52.770
I want it to be over.

1862
01:36:57.400 --> 01:37:00.230
I want it to be over. I'm getting married.

1863
01:37:00.770 --> 01:37:02.400
I'm settling down.

1864
01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:04.740
You've stolen almost $4 million.

1865
01:37:04.990 --> 01:37:07.280
You think we could call it

1866
01:37:04.990 --> 01:37:07.280
a wedding present?

1867
01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:09.660
This isn't something

1868
01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:09.660
you get to walk away from, Frank.

1869
01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:12.120
-I want to call a truce.

1870
01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:12.120
-No truce.

1871
01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:15.830
You will be caught, you will go to prison.

1872
01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:15.830
Where did you think this was going?

1873
01:37:16.370 --> 01:37:18.710
Please leave me alone, Carl.

1874
01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:20.590
Please?

1875
01:37:21.170 --> 01:37:23.260
I'm getting close, aren't I?

1876
01:37:23.340 --> 01:37:25.970
You're scared because

1877
01:37:23.340 --> 01:37:25.970
I'm getting close. I know

1878
01:37:26.050 --> 01:37:30.260
you rented a car in Shreveport,

1879
01:37:26.050 --> 01:37:30.260
stayed in a hotel on Lake Charles.

1880
01:37:31.260 --> 01:37:33.140
You want to run, be my guest.

1881
01:37:33.220 --> 01:37:35.850
Your cheques don't lie as well

1882
01:37:33.220 --> 01:37:35.850
as you do.

1883
01:37:35.930 --> 01:37:37.600
Stop chasing me.

1884
01:37:40.770 --> 01:37:42.270
I can't stop.

1885
01:37:43.610 --> 01:37:44.990
It's my job.

1886
01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:47.950
It's okay, Carl.

1887
01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:52.160
I just thought I'd ask.

1888
01:37:56.750 --> 01:37:58.250
Merry Christmas.

1889
01:38:01.790 --> 01:38:03.380
I love my job.

1890
01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:06.170
All right.

1891
01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:09.800
Let's get every newspaper in Louisiana

1892
01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:09.800
for the last two months.

1893
01:38:09.890 --> 01:38:11.350
What're we looking for?

1894
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:13.970
Engagement announcements.

1895
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:13.970
Name of Conners.

1896
01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:17.560
Come on, the kid

1897
01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:17.560
would have changed his name by now.

1898
01:38:18.690 --> 01:38:20.480
He can't change it.

1899
01:38:20.690 --> 01:38:22.360
She thinks he's Conners.

1900
01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:24.940
If he loses the name, he loses the girl.

1901
01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:37.790
-Congratulations!

1902
01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:37.790
-Having a good time?

1903
01:38:42.170 --> 01:38:43.670
Keep dancing.

1904
01:38:46.510 --> 01:38:48.170
Look who's here.

1905
01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:51.970
I'm going to the little boys' room.

1906
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:53.970
Hurry back.

1907
01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:12.360
Good evening.

1908
01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:12.360
I'm Agent Hanratty with the F.B.I.

1909
01:39:12.450 --> 01:39:14.780
We'd like to have a few kind words

1910
01:39:12.450 --> 01:39:14.780
with your host, if possible.

1911
01:39:14.870 --> 01:39:16.160
I'll get him.

1912
01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:20.540
Right over there, sir.

1913
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:24.710
Good evening, gentlemen.

1914
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:24.710
I'm Roger Strong.

1915
01:39:24.790 --> 01:39:28.300
Carl Hanratty, F.B.I.

1916
01:39:24.790 --> 01:39:28.300
These are Agents Amdursky and Fox.

1917
01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:32.890
-Sorry to crash your party, sir.

1918
01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:32.890
-Not at all. What can I do for you?

1919
01:39:32.970 --> 01:39:36.350
If it's not too much trouble,

1920
01:39:32.970 --> 01:39:36.350
I'd like to meet the groom.

1921
01:39:36.430 --> 01:39:38.220
Is there a problem?

1922
01:39:40.810 --> 01:39:43.400
Frank! Can you hold all these?

1923
01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:45.440
They're checks.

1924
01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:45.440
They're from my dad's friends.

1925
01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:47.820
They're for us so

1926
01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:47.820
we can start our new life...

1927
01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:50.490
What are you doing? What's wrong?

1928
01:39:50.610 --> 01:39:52.360
We have to leave.

1929
01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:56.700
You love me, right?

1930
01:39:56.910 --> 01:39:59.240
I mean, you'd love me no matter what.

1931
01:39:59.410 --> 01:40:03.250
You'd love me whether I was sick

1932
01:39:59.410 --> 01:40:03.250
or poor, or if I had a different name.

1933
01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:04.790
Frank, where did you get

1934
01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:04.790
all that money?

1935
01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:08.130
Brenda, listen. A name doesn't matter.

1936
01:40:08.210 --> 01:40:09.550
My name is Frank Conners.

1937
01:40:09.630 --> 01:40:12.260
That's who I am with you.

1938
01:40:09.630 --> 01:40:12.260
But we all have secrets.

1939
01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:14.550
Sometimes when I travel,

1940
01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:14.550
I use the name Frank Taylor.

1941
01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:16.300
That's my secret.

1942
01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:20.270
Frank Taylor, you know.

1943
01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:20.270
Frank Black. It doesn't matter.

1944
01:40:20.890 --> 01:40:22.480
Why are you saying all this?

1945
01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:26.560
Brenda, I don't want to lie

1946
01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:26.560
to you any more.

1947
01:40:26.650 --> 01:40:28.980
I'm not a doctor,

1948
01:40:26.650 --> 01:40:28.980
I never went to medical school.

1949
01:40:29.070 --> 01:40:32.360
I'm not a lawyer, or a Harvard graduate

1950
01:40:29.070 --> 01:40:32.360
or a Lutheran.

1951
01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:36.200
I ran away from home

1952
01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:36.200
a year and a half ago when I was 16.

1953
01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:43.620
You're not a Lutheran?

1954
01:40:44.790 --> 01:40:47.630
You see all this money? I have more.

1955
01:40:48.170 --> 01:40:50.000
I have plenty more.

1956
01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:54.470
I have enough money to last us

1957
01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:54.470
for the rest of our lives. Look.

1958
01:40:55.380 --> 01:40:57.300
Frank, stop teasing me!

1959
01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:01.100
You're Frank Conners

1960
01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:01.100
and you're 28 years old...

1961
01:41:03.310 --> 01:41:05.140
Why would you lie to me?

1962
01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:09.400
I want to know your name.

1963
01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:09.400
Tell me your name.

1964
01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:12.860
We can live anywhere we want.

1965
01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:12.860
But you have to trust me.

1966
01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:15.780
Do you trust me?

1967
01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:15.780
Do you love me, Brenda?

1968
01:41:15.860 --> 01:41:17.320
Yes. I love you.

1969
01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:19.620
Excuse me, Mother.

1970
01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:22.950
This is Mr Hanratty. My wife, Carol.

1971
01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:25.000
-Mister...

1972
01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:25.000
-Hanratty, ma'am.

1973
01:41:25.290 --> 01:41:27.120
Have you seen Frank or Brenda?

1974
01:41:27.210 --> 01:41:29.170
I think they went upstairs.

1975
01:41:38.890 --> 01:41:40.050
Come here.

1976
01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:44.350
In two days,

1977
01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:44.350
meet me at Miami International Airport.

1978
01:41:44.430 --> 01:41:48.100
Leave the house after your parents

1979
01:41:44.430 --> 01:41:48.100
go to sleep. Take a taxicab.

1980
01:41:48.190 --> 01:41:51.820
Give the taxi driver this money.

1981
01:41:48.190 --> 01:41:51.820
Tell him to drive all through the night.

1982
01:41:51.900 --> 01:41:53.780
You're gonna leave at 10:00 a.m.

1983
01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:55.320
10:00 a.m. All right?

1984
01:42:15.010 --> 01:42:17.220
-Which room, sir?

1985
01:42:15.010 --> 01:42:17.220
-In the corner.

1986
01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:21.890
You have to listen. The International

1987
01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:21.890
Terminal in Miami. Say it.

1988
01:42:22.010 --> 01:42:26.140
No matter what, take a taxicab,

1989
01:42:22.010 --> 01:42:26.140
be there at 10:00 a.m.

1990
01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:28.020
I'll be there at 10:00 a.m.

1991
01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:28.020
no matter what.

1992
01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:30.650
In two days. Two days, Brenda.

1993
01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:30.650
Two days.

1994
01:42:30.730 --> 01:42:33.610
In two days I'll be there,

1995
01:42:30.730 --> 01:42:33.610
no matter what, at 10:00 a.m.

1996
01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:43.490
We're not gonna tell anyone, Brenda.

1997
01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:43.490
You have to promise me now.

1998
01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:48.710
Please! Before you go,

1999
01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:48.710
please tell me your name. Tell me.

2000
01:42:50.170 --> 01:42:53.790
Frank William Abagnale, Jr.

2001
01:45:06.590 --> 01:45:07.840
Brenda.

2002
01:45:20.860 --> 01:45:22.900
-This guy is a no-show.

2003
01:45:20.860 --> 01:45:22.900
-Maybe he was tipped.

2004
01:45:23.190 --> 01:45:24.740
He's not here today, it'll be tomorrow.

2005
01:45:24.820 --> 01:45:26.490
We'll get him before

2006
01:45:24.820 --> 01:45:26.490
he leaves the country.

2007
01:45:26.570 --> 01:45:28.370
He doesn't have a passport.

2008
01:45:28.450 --> 01:45:30.490
For the last six months,

2009
01:45:28.450 --> 01:45:30.490
he's gone to Harvard and Berkeley.

2010
01:45:30.580 --> 01:45:32.620
I'm betting he can get a passport.

2011
01:45:32.700 --> 01:45:35.040
Our men are waiting for him here

2012
01:45:32.700 --> 01:45:35.040
in Miami International.

2013
01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:36.750
He's used it before,

2014
01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:36.750
he knows the layout.

2015
01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:40.290
The Miami police offered us

2016
01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:40.290
50 uniformed cops in two shifts of 25.

2017
01:45:40.380 --> 01:45:42.750
With our guys,

2018
01:45:40.380 --> 01:45:42.750
that's almost 100 men in one airport.

2019
01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:44.300
Don't you think we should

2020
01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:44.300
spread it around?

2021
01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:45.880
No, this is the exit point.

2022
01:45:45.970 --> 01:45:47.510
How do you know he hasn't rented a car

2023
01:45:47.590 --> 01:45:49.970
and driven to airports

2024
01:45:47.590 --> 01:45:49.970
in New York, Atlanta?

2025
01:45:50.050 --> 01:45:53.100
Because I'm not in New York.

2026
01:45:50.050 --> 01:45:53.100
I'm not in Atlanta.

2027
01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:55.680
Yes. This is Frank Roberts.

2028
01:45:55.770 --> 01:45:58.270
I'm letting all the universities

2029
01:45:55.770 --> 01:45:58.270
in the area know

2030
01:45:58.350 --> 01:46:02.110
that Pan Am will be initiating

2031
01:45:58.350 --> 01:46:02.110
a new recruiting programme this year.

2032
01:46:02.190 --> 01:46:05.110
I'll be stopping by

2033
01:46:02.190 --> 01:46:05.110
your campus tomorrow morning.

2034
01:46:05.940 --> 01:46:08.150
Thank you all very much for coming.

2035
01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:12.080
At the end of the day,

2036
01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:12.080
I'll be choosing eight young ladies

2037
01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:13.580
to be a part of

2038
01:46:14.330 --> 01:46:18.160
Pan Am's future stewardess

2039
01:46:14.330 --> 01:46:18.160
flight crew programme.

2040
01:46:18.250 --> 01:46:20.380
These eight young ladies

2041
01:46:18.250 --> 01:46:20.380
will accompany me on

2042
01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:23.340
a two-month public relations tour

2043
01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:23.340
through Europe

2044
01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:27.130
where they will discover firsthand

2045
01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:27.130
what it takes

2046
01:46:27.220 --> 01:46:29.260
to be a Pan American stewardess.

2047
01:46:32.350 --> 01:46:36.390
Give me at least two men, no,

2048
01:46:32.350 --> 01:46:36.390
one man per every two counters.

2049
01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:39.690
Amdursky?

2050
01:46:41.310 --> 01:46:45.400
Make sure your uniforms are covering

2051
01:46:41.310 --> 01:46:45.400
the sidewalks, entrances and exits.

2052
01:46:47.570 --> 01:46:50.410
Let's have periodic sweeps

2053
01:46:47.570 --> 01:46:50.410
of the men's lav.

2054
01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:55.120
What qualifies me

2055
01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:55.120
to be a future stewardess?

2056
01:46:55.370 --> 01:47:00.120
Well, I think that I'm really friendly

2057
01:46:55.370 --> 01:47:00.120
and I can really help out

2058
01:47:00.210 --> 01:47:03.210
and make people feel welcome

2059
01:47:00.210 --> 01:47:03.210
on the plane and...

2060
01:47:03.290 --> 01:47:05.500
We'll be travelling

2061
01:47:03.290 --> 01:47:05.500
at 6,000 miles per hour,

2062
01:47:05.590 --> 01:47:07.550
at an altitude of 300 feet.

2063
01:47:07.670 --> 01:47:09.970
All my bags are packed

2064
01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:12.390
I'm ready to go

2065
01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:16.350
Ilene Anderson.

2066
01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:26.020
Miggy Acker.

2067
01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:32.570
Debra Jo McMillan.

2068
01:47:39.620 --> 01:47:41.040
Candy Heston.

2069
01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:43.640
-Did you see that blonde out front?

2070
01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:43.640
-I should have been a pilot.

2071
01:48:43.730 --> 01:48:44.730
Exactly.

2072
01:48:44.810 --> 01:48:47.690
Mr Hanratty,

2073
01:48:44.810 --> 01:48:47.690
pick up the courtesy telephone.

2074
01:48:47.770 --> 01:48:50.190
-Hanratty.

2075
01:48:47.770 --> 01:48:50.190
-Your walkie-talkie wasn't working.

2076
01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:51.940
There's a guy in a Pan Am uniform

2077
01:48:52.030 --> 01:48:54.860
sitting in a white Coupe DeVille

2078
01:48:52.030 --> 01:48:54.860
in front of Terminal J.

2079
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:58.160
That's the charter terminal.

2080
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:58.160
Did you get a look at his face?

2081
01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:01.370
He's got his pilot's cap on.

2082
01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:01.370
Carl, I think it's him.

2083
01:49:13.550 --> 01:49:15.180
Out of the car, Frank.

2084
01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:17.010
Frank?

2085
01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:19.050
Step out of the car.

2086
01:49:19.300 --> 01:49:21.260
Keep your hands where I can see them.

2087
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:23.220
Don't shoot me. I'm just a driver.

2088
01:49:23.310 --> 01:49:25.140
A man paid me $100

2089
01:49:23.310 --> 01:49:25.140
to wear this uniform

2090
01:49:25.230 --> 01:49:28.440
-to pick someone up at the airport.

2091
01:49:25.230 --> 01:49:28.440
-Who're you picking up?

2092
01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:29.650
Hey!

2093
01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:57.300
South America, Australia,

2094
01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:57.300
Singapore, Egypt.

2095
01:49:57.380 --> 01:49:59.510
The kid's gone completely

2096
01:49:57.380 --> 01:49:59.510
out of control.

2097
01:49:59.590 --> 01:50:01.930
-Why wasn't I called?

2098
01:49:59.590 --> 01:50:01.930
-Nobody was called, sir.

2099
01:50:02.010 --> 01:50:03.810
The banks didn't know

2100
01:50:02.010 --> 01:50:03.810
what was happening until last week.

2101
01:50:03.890 --> 01:50:04.930
That's impossible.

2102
01:50:05.020 --> 01:50:07.270
They didn't call because it's not

2103
01:50:05.020 --> 01:50:07.270
counterfeiting. It's something else.

2104
01:50:07.350 --> 01:50:09.980
-What is he doing?

2105
01:50:07.350 --> 01:50:09.980
-He's making real checks, sir.

2106
01:50:10.060 --> 01:50:11.940
These are so perfect,

2107
01:50:10.060 --> 01:50:11.940
the airline didn't know the difference.

2108
01:50:12.020 --> 01:50:13.900
Last cheque was cashed in Madrid

2109
01:50:12.020 --> 01:50:13.900
a week ago.

2110
01:50:13.980 --> 01:50:16.780
My guess is he's still there.

2111
01:50:13.980 --> 01:50:16.780
We've to leave now, sir. Today.

2112
01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:19.530
For where? Spain?

2113
01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:19.530
You want to go to Spain?

2114
01:50:19.610 --> 01:50:21.910
Eventually, he's gotta go back

2115
01:50:19.610 --> 01:50:21.910
to where the cheques were printed.

2116
01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:23.370
I think that's why he's moving back

2117
01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:23.370
through Europe.

2118
01:50:23.450 --> 01:50:24.870
Look at the map, sir.

2119
01:50:23.450 --> 01:50:24.870
He's making a circle.

2120
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:26.660
He's running out of checks.

2121
01:50:26.750 --> 01:50:31.210
It's a long shot, but if we could track him

2122
01:50:26.750 --> 01:50:31.210
from Madrid, we could still catch him.

2123
01:50:31.290 --> 01:50:34.300
I'm sorry, Carl. If you couldn't catch him

2124
01:50:31.290 --> 01:50:34.300
here, you're not gonna catch him there.

2125
01:50:34.380 --> 01:50:36.210
We're going to let him get away.

2126
01:50:37.380 --> 01:50:39.760
No, Carl, you let him get away.

2127
01:51:21.630 --> 01:51:24.260
A perfect one-sixteenth

2128
01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:26.430
all the way around.

2129
01:51:28.730 --> 01:51:31.020
Colour separation is flawless.

2130
01:51:33.770 --> 01:51:35.320
There's no bleeding.

2131
01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:38.150
Nobody does work like this

2132
01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:38.150
in the States.

2133
01:51:38.230 --> 01:51:39.690
Nobody but us.

2134
01:51:39.780 --> 01:51:41.490
Where was it printed?

2135
01:51:41.570 --> 01:51:44.370
-It was printed on a monster.

2136
01:51:41.570 --> 01:51:44.370
-A monster.

2137
01:51:44.450 --> 01:51:46.830
-A Heidelberg, an Istra.

2138
01:51:44.450 --> 01:51:46.830
-Heidelberg.

2139
01:51:46.910 --> 01:51:50.250
A dinosaur, four colours,

2140
01:51:46.910 --> 01:51:50.250
you can smell the weight.

2141
01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:52.670
Two tons, without the ink.

2142
01:51:53.210 --> 01:51:55.630
Where do they do printing like this?

2143
01:51:55.710 --> 01:51:57.340
Germany, Great Britain.

2144
01:51:57.420 --> 01:51:58.670
France.

2145
01:52:01.090 --> 01:52:03.510
France. Frank's mother said the name

2146
01:52:01.090 --> 01:52:03.510
of a village in France,

2147
01:52:03.590 --> 01:52:04.890
where they didn't have Sara Lee.

2148
01:52:04.970 --> 01:52:06.680
The village where

2149
01:52:04.970 --> 01:52:06.680
she met Frank's father.

2150
01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:07.890
I don't remember.

2151
01:52:07.970 --> 01:52:11.810
It started with an "M."

2152
01:52:07.970 --> 01:52:11.810
It was "Mont" something. Mr Fox?

2153
01:52:11.890 --> 01:52:14.350
Yes. Question,

2154
01:52:11.890 --> 01:52:14.350
"You met your husband during the war?"

2155
01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:16.440
Answer, "I lived in a very small village

2156
01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:16.440
in France,

2157
01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:18.070
"the kind of place

2158
01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:18.070
where they never heard of Sara Lee."

2159
01:52:18.150 --> 01:52:21.110
Tell me you wrote down

2160
01:52:18.150 --> 01:52:21.110
the name of the village, Mr Fox.

2161
01:52:22.610 --> 01:52:24.030
Montrichard.

2162
01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:22.050
Carl?

2163
01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:26.380
Merry Christmas!

2164
01:53:26.510 --> 01:53:29.470
How is it that we're always talking

2165
01:53:26.510 --> 01:53:29.470
on Christmas?

2166
01:53:29.550 --> 01:53:31.760
Every Christmas, I'm talking to you!

2167
01:53:31.850 --> 01:53:34.430
Put your shirt on, Frank.

2168
01:53:31.850 --> 01:53:34.430
You're under arrest.

2169
01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:36.640
Are you hungry?

2170
01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:36.640
Do you want some beans?

2171
01:53:36.730 --> 01:53:38.650
Carl, they got

2172
01:53:36.730 --> 01:53:38.650
the best French beans here.

2173
01:53:38.730 --> 01:53:42.480
There's two dozen

2174
01:53:38.730 --> 01:53:42.480
French police officers outside.

2175
01:53:42.570 --> 01:53:43.990
They wanted to bring you in,

2176
01:53:44.070 --> 01:53:46.400
but they needed the help

2177
01:53:44.070 --> 01:53:46.400
of an American.

2178
01:53:46.490 --> 01:53:47.990
But I told them

2179
01:53:46.490 --> 01:53:47.990
I wouldn't bring them to you,

2180
01:53:48.070 --> 01:53:50.070
unless I could put the cuffs

2181
01:53:48.070 --> 01:53:50.070
on you myself.

2182
01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:52.830
You have a gun? Do you have a gun?

2183
01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:52.830
No gun?

2184
01:53:52.910 --> 01:53:53.910
-No.

2185
01:53:52.910 --> 01:53:53.910
-No gun.

2186
01:53:55.870 --> 01:53:58.040
And you're telling me what?

2187
01:53:59.250 --> 01:54:01.210
There's two dozen

2188
01:53:59.250 --> 01:54:01.210
French police officers

2189
01:54:01.290 --> 01:54:02.800
out there right now on Christmas Eve?

2190
01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:05.090
-That's what you're telling me?

2191
01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:05.090
-Yeah.

2192
01:54:05.170 --> 01:54:07.760
All right. There's no windows here.

2193
01:54:08.340 --> 01:54:09.840
I'm going to take a look

2194
01:54:08.340 --> 01:54:09.840
out the front door.

2195
01:54:09.930 --> 01:54:10.930
No!

2196
01:54:11.010 --> 01:54:15.020
I told them I'd walk out first

2197
01:54:11.010 --> 01:54:15.020
and give a signal. Put these on yourself.

2198
01:54:15.100 --> 01:54:17.770
No, I can't do that! You know why?

2199
01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:20.860
Because I think you're full of shit.

2200
01:54:20.940 --> 01:54:23.520
I don't think there's anyone else

2201
01:54:20.940 --> 01:54:23.520
out there.

2202
01:54:23.610 --> 01:54:26.440
I think it's just me and you. That's right.

2203
01:54:26.530 --> 01:54:28.320
It's just me and you,

2204
01:54:26.530 --> 01:54:28.320
and you know what?

2205
01:54:28.990 --> 01:54:30.950
You're gonna have to catch me yourself.

2206
01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:33.990
-We don't have time for this.

2207
01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:33.990
-That's good.

2208
01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:37.330
Tell me what you want me to see.

2209
01:54:37.870 --> 01:54:41.540
-I wouldn't lie to you.

2210
01:54:37.870 --> 01:54:41.540
-You're wearing a wedding ring.

2211
01:54:41.630 --> 01:54:44.250
You lied to me about that!

2212
01:54:41.630 --> 01:54:44.250
Did you lie about that?

2213
01:54:44.340 --> 01:54:48.170
You asked me if I had a family.

2214
01:54:44.340 --> 01:54:48.170
I did. But I don't any more.

2215
01:54:56.850 --> 01:55:00.770
Yes. No, there is no problem.

2216
01:54:56.850 --> 01:55:00.770
We're coming out right now.

2217
01:55:03.190 --> 01:55:04.730
That was good.

2218
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:07.400
Did you pay some hotel desk clerk

2219
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:07.400
to make that call for you?

2220
01:55:07.490 --> 01:55:08.530
Is that what you did?

2221
01:55:08.610 --> 01:55:11.780
It was Captain Luc.

2222
01:55:08.610 --> 01:55:11.780
I've got one minute to bring you out.

2223
01:55:11.860 --> 01:55:14.280
Captain Luc? Oh, Captain Luc! Well,

2224
01:55:14.370 --> 01:55:18.250
that sounds pretty official to me,

2225
01:55:14.370 --> 01:55:18.250
but, like I said,

2226
01:55:18.330 --> 01:55:22.290
I think it's just me and you here.

2227
01:55:18.330 --> 01:55:22.290
So you'll have to catch me.

2228
01:55:22.380 --> 01:55:24.880
Frank, you have to trust me on this.

2229
01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:28.090
These people have been embarrassed.

2230
01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:28.090
They're angry.

2231
01:55:28.170 --> 01:55:30.630
You rob their banks, you steal

2232
01:55:28.170 --> 01:55:30.630
their money, you live in their country.

2233
01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:32.970
I told you this was

2234
01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:32.970
what was going to happen.

2235
01:55:33.050 --> 01:55:34.760
That there was no other way

2236
01:55:33.050 --> 01:55:34.760
for it to end.

2237
01:55:36.060 --> 01:55:37.930
Don't make a mistake.

2238
01:55:38.140 --> 01:55:40.390
That's good, Carl, you know?

2239
01:55:41.020 --> 01:55:43.770
Keep pushing that lie. Keep pushing it.

2240
01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:47.480
-Keep pushing till you make it true.

2241
01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:47.480
-They'll kill you.

2242
01:55:47.820 --> 01:55:50.030
You walk out that door,

2243
01:55:47.820 --> 01:55:50.030
they're gonna kill you.

2244
01:55:55.280 --> 01:55:57.030
Is that the truth?

2245
01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:02.250
Yeah.

2246
01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:09.550
Do you have any children, Carl?

2247
01:56:10.970 --> 01:56:13.380
I have a 4-year-old daughter.

2248
01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:16.550
Do you swear on your daughter?

2249
01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:20.100
You swear?

2250
01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:26.810
You swear?

2251
01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:00.970
That was really good, Carl.

2252
01:57:08.690 --> 01:57:10.020
I have him in custody.

2253
01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:13.610
I got him! It's all right.

2254
01:57:15.610 --> 01:57:17.490
It's all right. I got him.

2255
01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:23.250
I want it on the record.

2256
01:57:23.870 --> 01:57:27.580
Frank Abagnale surrendered

2257
01:57:23.870 --> 01:57:27.580
of his own accord. Understood?

2258
01:57:28.750 --> 01:57:31.420
Where are you taking him?

2259
01:57:28.750 --> 01:57:31.420
I'm supposed to go.

2260
01:57:33.340 --> 01:57:35.930
Let me in the car!

2261
01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:45.430
Don't worry. I'll have you extradited back

2262
01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:45.430
to the United States.

2263
01:58:06.750 --> 01:58:07.830
Carl.

2264
01:58:11.500 --> 01:58:15.260
You have to remember

2265
01:58:11.500 --> 01:58:15.260
to let me call my father when we land.

2266
01:58:15.340 --> 01:58:20.090
I want to talk to him before he sees me

2267
01:58:15.340 --> 01:58:20.090
on television or something like that.

2268
01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:31.810
Carl, look.

2269
01:58:32.150 --> 01:58:34.150
That's LaGuardia right there.

2270
01:58:34.230 --> 01:58:35.610
Runway 44.

2271
01:58:35.740 --> 01:58:37.900
Frank, your father is dead.

2272
01:58:38.740 --> 01:58:40.110
I'm sorry.

2273
01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:44.830
I didn't want to say anything

2274
01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:44.830
until we got closer to home.

2275
01:58:45.660 --> 01:58:46.950
He fell down some steps

2276
01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:50.290
at Grand Central Station

2277
01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:50.290
trying to catch a train.

2278
01:58:50.830 --> 01:58:52.880
I didn't want to be the one to tell you.

2279
01:58:53.880 --> 01:58:55.710
You're lying, right?

2280
01:58:57.510 --> 01:58:59.800
You said I could talk to him.

2281
01:58:59.930 --> 01:59:02.720
Who are you to say something like that?

2282
01:59:03.640 --> 01:59:05.890
-You said I could talk to him.

2283
01:59:03.640 --> 01:59:05.890
-He fell

2284
01:59:05.970 --> 01:59:08.480
and he broke his neck. I'm sorry.

2285
01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:11.350
I'm really sorry.

2286
01:59:22.410 --> 01:59:23.820
God damn it!

2287
01:59:25.830 --> 01:59:27.700
I'm going to be sick.

2288
01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:29.960
It's all right. It's okay.

2289
01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:33.670
-I'm going to be sick!

2290
01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:33.670
-Sure. Let's go to the bathroom.

2291
01:59:40.590 --> 01:59:42.010
God damn it!

2292
02:00:01.740 --> 02:00:02.950
Daddy.

2293
02:00:05.570 --> 02:00:06.830
You'll have to take your seat, sir.

2294
02:00:06.910 --> 02:00:09.500
I've told you twice.

2295
02:00:06.910 --> 02:00:09.500
We're landing. All of you.

2296
02:00:09.580 --> 02:00:11.370
Frank! Come on now.

2297
02:00:11.620 --> 02:00:14.500
We're landing in six minutes.

2298
02:00:11.620 --> 02:00:14.500
You need to be in your seats...

2299
02:00:14.580 --> 02:00:17.000
-Open the door!

2300
02:00:14.580 --> 02:00:17.000
-...with seat belts fastened.

2301
02:00:20.260 --> 02:00:21.590
You do it.

2302
02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:52.370
Frank!

2303
02:00:58.340 --> 02:01:01.300
All right,

2304
02:00:58.340 --> 02:01:01.300
remain seated everyone, please.

2305
02:01:10.430 --> 02:01:12.350
Please remain seated.

2306
02:01:15.270 --> 02:01:16.770
God Almighty.

2307
02:02:06.490 --> 02:02:08.200
What's your name?

2308
02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:13.580
Where's your mommy?

2309
02:02:38.890 --> 02:02:40.650
Sarge, we're good.

2310
02:02:50.740 --> 02:02:51.820
Hold up!

2311
02:02:55.450 --> 02:02:57.830
Put your hands behind your head!

2312
02:02:57.910 --> 02:02:59.080
Carl.

2313
02:02:59.290 --> 02:03:01.420
Get me in the car, please.

2314
02:03:04.130 --> 02:03:05.550
Put him in.

2315
02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:25.820
Taking into account

2316
02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:25.820
the gravity of these crimes,

2317
02:03:25.980 --> 02:03:29.070
your history of bold

2318
02:03:25.980 --> 02:03:29.070
and elusive behaviour

2319
02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:33.320
and your complete lack of respect

2320
02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:33.320
for the laws of the United States,

2321
02:03:33.910 --> 02:03:38.330
I have no choice but to ignore

2322
02:03:33.910 --> 02:03:38.330
your request to be treated as a minor,

2323
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:43.500
and sentence you to 12 years

2324
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:43.500
in Atlanta's maximum security prison

2325
02:03:44.130 --> 02:03:47.760
and recommend strongly

2326
02:03:44.130 --> 02:03:47.760
that you be kept in isolation

2327
02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:50.470
for the entirety of that sentence.

2328
02:04:32.550 --> 02:04:34.180
Merry Christmas, Frank.

2329
02:04:37.220 --> 02:04:39.390
I got you some comic books.

2330
02:04:46.310 --> 02:04:48.730
How's your daughter?

2331
02:04:46.310 --> 02:04:48.730
What was her name?

2332
02:04:49.110 --> 02:04:50.320
Grace.

2333
02:04:52.030 --> 02:04:55.160
I don't know. She lives with her mother

2334
02:04:52.030 --> 02:04:55.160
in Chicago, I don't get to see her much.

2335
02:04:57.240 --> 02:04:59.280
What's in the briefcase?

2336
02:05:00.290 --> 02:05:02.580
I'm on my way to the airport.

2337
02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:05.540
It's a paperhanger

2338
02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:05.540
working his way through Minnesota.

2339
02:05:07.130 --> 02:05:09.420
Jesus. He's driving us crazy.

2340
02:05:09.710 --> 02:05:11.170
You got any of the checks?

2341
02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:14.130
Yeah, I got a counterfeit he drew

2342
02:05:14.430 --> 02:05:16.680
in Great Lakes Savings and Loan.

2343
02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:19.810
He's using a stencil machine

2344
02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:19.810
and an Underwood.

2345
02:05:20.260 --> 02:05:21.850
It's a teller at the bank.

2346
02:05:22.270 --> 02:05:23.560
Say again?

2347
02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:25.350
It's definitely a teller, Carl.

2348
02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:28.360
Banks always use hand stamps

2349
02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:28.360
for the dates.

2350
02:05:28.440 --> 02:05:31.610
They get used over and over again,

2351
02:05:28.440 --> 02:05:31.610
so they always get worn out.

2352
02:05:31.690 --> 02:05:35.240
And the numbers are always cracking.

2353
02:05:31.690 --> 02:05:35.240
The sixes and the nines,

2354
02:05:35.320 --> 02:05:37.110
see, they go first.

2355
02:05:39.530 --> 02:05:40.780
Thanks.

2356
02:05:46.870 --> 02:05:49.710
I'd like you to take a look

2357
02:05:46.870 --> 02:05:49.710
at something for me.

2358
02:05:53.960 --> 02:05:55.970
Tell me what you think.

2359
02:05:59.470 --> 02:06:01.010
That's a fake.

2360
02:06:01.140 --> 02:06:02.470
How do you know,

2361
02:06:01.140 --> 02:06:02.470
you haven't looked at it?

2362
02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:04.680
There's no perforated edge, right?

2363
02:06:04.810 --> 02:06:07.730
I mean, this cheque was hand-cut,

2364
02:06:04.810 --> 02:06:07.730
not fed.

2365
02:06:09.060 --> 02:06:10.270
Yeah.

2366
02:06:10.360 --> 02:06:14.150
Paper is double-bonded,

2367
02:06:10.360 --> 02:06:14.150
much too heavy to be a bank cheque.

2368
02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:19.320
Magnetic ink, it's raised against

2369
02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:19.320
my fingers instead of flat.

2370
02:06:21.030 --> 02:06:25.330
And this doesn't smell like MICR,

2371
02:06:21.030 --> 02:06:25.330
it's some kind of a drafting ink.

2372
02:06:25.410 --> 02:06:28.210
The kind you get at a stationery store.

2373
02:06:33.500 --> 02:06:34.760
Frank,

2374
02:06:35.510 --> 02:06:40.090
would you be interested in working

2375
02:06:35.510 --> 02:06:40.090
with the F.B.I.'s Financial Crimes Unit?

2376
02:06:40.430 --> 02:06:43.850
I already got a job here, you know.

2377
02:06:40.430 --> 02:06:43.850
I deliver the mail.

2378
02:06:46.390 --> 02:06:49.810
Frank, we have the power

2379
02:06:46.390 --> 02:06:49.810
to take you out of prison.

2380
02:06:50.980 --> 02:06:53.440
You'll be placed in the custody

2381
02:06:50.980 --> 02:06:53.440
of the F.B.I. where you'd serve out

2382
02:06:53.520 --> 02:06:54.610
the remainder of your sentence

2383
02:06:54.690 --> 02:06:56.240
as an employee

2384
02:06:54.690 --> 02:06:56.240
of the Federal Government.

2385
02:06:59.200 --> 02:07:01.030
Under whose custody?

2386
02:07:09.870 --> 02:07:11.080
Hi.

2387
02:07:11.210 --> 02:07:14.880
I'm Frank Abagnale.

2388
02:07:11.210 --> 02:07:14.880
I'm supposed to start work here today.

2389
02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:18.090
It's a tour company

2390
02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:18.090
operating out of the BVI.

2391
02:07:18.300 --> 02:07:19.970
Sir, Mr Abagnale is here.

2392
02:07:20.050 --> 02:07:22.090
I'm gonna call you back.

2393
02:07:52.080 --> 02:07:54.790
-Hello, Carl.

2394
02:07:52.080 --> 02:07:54.790
-Welcome to the F.B.I.

2395
02:07:55.420 --> 02:07:57.960
I'll show you where you're working.

2396
02:08:06.930 --> 02:08:09.350
How long do I have to work here?

2397
02:08:09.470 --> 02:08:12.060
It's 8:15 in the morning

2398
02:08:09.470 --> 02:08:12.060
to 5:00 in the afternoon,

2399
02:08:12.140 --> 02:08:14.100
45 minutes for lunch.

2400
02:08:15.940 --> 02:08:17.690
No. I mean, how long?

2401
02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:20.780
Every day.

2402
02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:23.530
Every day, Frank, till we let you go.

2403
02:09:17.420 --> 02:09:18.750
Hey, Carl.

2404
02:09:21.340 --> 02:09:22.590
How are you doing?

2405
02:09:22.670 --> 02:09:26.510
It's not a good time, Frank.

2406
02:09:22.670 --> 02:09:26.510
I'm clearing my desk for the weekend.

2407
02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:32.220
You mind

2408
02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:32.220
if I come to work with you tomorrow?

2409
02:09:32.350 --> 02:09:34.180
Tomorrow is Saturday.

2410
02:09:34.270 --> 02:09:36.140
I'm flying to Chicago

2411
02:09:34.270 --> 02:09:36.140
to see my daughter.

2412
02:09:36.230 --> 02:09:37.560
I'll be back to work on Monday.

2413
02:09:37.690 --> 02:09:41.070
-You're going to see Grace?

2414
02:09:37.690 --> 02:09:41.070
-Yeah, that's the plan.

2415
02:09:44.740 --> 02:09:46.780
What should I do till Monday?

2416
02:09:46.860 --> 02:09:50.200
I'm sorry, kid, I can't help you there.

2417
02:09:46.860 --> 02:09:50.200
Excuse me.

2418
02:09:56.540 --> 02:09:58.250
This is Hanratty.

2419
02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:00.710
Yeah, put him on.

2420
02:10:08.890 --> 02:10:10.260
Mr Sawyer.

2421
02:10:10.970 --> 02:10:12.430
How are you?

2422
02:10:12.720 --> 02:10:16.600
I have half a dozen more cheques

2423
02:10:12.720 --> 02:10:16.600
on that tour operator at the BVI.

2424
02:10:56.930 --> 02:10:58.940
How did you do it, Frank?

2425
02:11:00.770 --> 02:11:03.440
How did you pass the bar in Louisiana?

2426
02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:05.610
What are you doing here?

2427
02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:07.490
Listen.

2428
02:11:08.200 --> 02:11:10.110
I'm sorry I put you through all this.

2429
02:11:10.200 --> 02:11:12.990
You go back to Europe,

2430
02:11:10.200 --> 02:11:12.990
you'll die in Perpignan Prison.

2431
02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:14.030
You try to run here in the States,

2432
02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:17.450
we'll send you back to Atlanta

2433
02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:17.450
for 50 years.

2434
02:11:17.540 --> 02:11:19.000
I know that.

2435
02:11:20.670 --> 02:11:23.170
I spent four years

2436
02:11:20.670 --> 02:11:23.170
trying to arrange your release.

2437
02:11:23.290 --> 02:11:25.090
I had to convince my bosses

2438
02:11:23.290 --> 02:11:25.090
at the F.B.I.

2439
02:11:25.170 --> 02:11:28.050
and the Attorney General

2440
02:11:25.170 --> 02:11:28.050
of the United States you wouldn't run.

2441
02:11:28.550 --> 02:11:30.300
Why did you do it?

2442
02:11:31.010 --> 02:11:33.720
-You're just a kid.

2443
02:11:31.010 --> 02:11:33.720
-I'm not your kid.

2444
02:11:34.140 --> 02:11:36.520
You said you were going to Chicago.

2445
02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:40.480
My daughter can't see me this weekend.

2446
02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:40.480
She's going skiing.

2447
02:11:41.020 --> 02:11:43.310
You said she was four years old.

2448
02:11:41.020 --> 02:11:43.310
You're lying.

2449
02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:46.190
She was four when I left. Now she's 15.

2450
02:11:46.690 --> 02:11:49.570
My wife has been remarried

2451
02:11:46.690 --> 02:11:49.570
for 11 years.

2452
02:11:49.650 --> 02:11:52.070
I see Grace every now and again.

2453
02:11:52.820 --> 02:11:55.330
-I don't understand.

2454
02:11:52.820 --> 02:11:55.330
-Sure you do.

2455
02:11:56.160 --> 02:11:58.870
Sometimes it's easier living the lie.

2456
02:12:02.170 --> 02:12:04.500
I'm gonna let you fly tonight, Frank.

2457
02:12:05.340 --> 02:12:09.510
I won't even try to stop you, because

2458
02:12:05.340 --> 02:12:09.510
I know you'll be back on Monday.

2459
02:12:09.590 --> 02:12:10.760
Yeah.

2460
02:12:11.260 --> 02:12:13.680
How do you know I'll come back?

2461
02:12:16.050 --> 02:12:17.180
Look.

2462
02:12:19.720 --> 02:12:21.690
Nobody is chasing you.

2463
02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:44.540
Alice, has he still not called?

2464
02:12:44.620 --> 02:12:46.210
No, he hasn't.

2465
02:12:57.720 --> 02:12:59.010
Good morning.

2466
02:12:59.100 --> 02:13:01.140
I've called this meeting to discuss

2467
02:13:01.220 --> 02:13:03.560
a new type of cheque fraud

2468
02:13:01.220 --> 02:13:03.560
and counterfeiting.

2469
02:13:03.640 --> 02:13:05.850
The unsub is washing

2470
02:13:03.640 --> 02:13:05.850
and altering checks,

2471
02:13:05.940 --> 02:13:07.520
then passing them throughout Arizona.

2472
02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:16.410
This unsub is a big dog, passing

2473
02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:16.410
cheques as large as five figures.

2474
02:13:19.780 --> 02:13:21.410
Sorry I'm late.

2475
02:13:22.700 --> 02:13:23.910
Sorry.

2476
02:13:28.130 --> 02:13:31.000
We have a recovered cheque

2477
02:13:28.130 --> 02:13:31.000
on Agent Reiter's desk.

2478
02:13:31.090 --> 02:13:33.800
Why don't we step out to the bullpen?

2479
02:13:38.220 --> 02:13:40.760
There's impressions on every line.

2480
02:13:42.430 --> 02:13:45.440
Looks like the original amount

2481
02:13:42.430 --> 02:13:45.440
was for $60.

2482
02:13:48.980 --> 02:13:50.900
Mind if I take a look?

2483
02:13:53.990 --> 02:13:56.400
Cashed in Flagstaff a week ago.

2484
02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:01.240
Cost the bank $16,000.

2485
02:14:02.910 --> 02:14:04.960
-It's a real cheque.

2486
02:14:02.910 --> 02:14:04.960
-Yeah.

2487
02:14:05.620 --> 02:14:09.040
It's been washed.

2488
02:14:05.620 --> 02:14:09.040
The only thing original is the signature.

2489
02:14:09.130 --> 02:14:10.840
But it's perfect.

2490
02:14:11.250 --> 02:14:14.170
I mean, this isn't hydrochloride

2491
02:14:11.250 --> 02:14:14.170
or bleach.

2492
02:14:14.340 --> 02:14:15.470
No.

2493
02:14:15.590 --> 02:14:17.130
Something new.

2494
02:14:17.300 --> 02:14:22.310
A nail polish remover where the acetone

2495
02:14:17.300 --> 02:14:22.310
removes the ink that's not been printed?

2496
02:14:25.430 --> 02:14:27.230
How did you do it, Frank?

2497
02:14:28.650 --> 02:14:31.820
How did you cheat on the bar exam

2498
02:14:28.650 --> 02:14:31.820
in Louisiana?

2499
02:14:36.990 --> 02:14:38.610
I didn't cheat.

2500
02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:42.870
I studied for two weeks and I passed.

2501
02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:46.790
Is that the truth?

2502
02:14:48.790 --> 02:14:51.960
I'll bet this guy steals cheques

2503
02:14:48.790 --> 02:14:51.960
out of mailboxes.

2504
02:14:52.040 --> 02:14:55.170
He washes off their names

2505
02:14:52.040 --> 02:14:55.170
and puts on his own.

2506
02:14:56.630 --> 02:14:58.760
You're saying he's a local?

2507
02:14:58.840 --> 02:15:02.600
If it were me, I'd call the bank first.

2508
02:14:58.840 --> 02:15:02.600
Check out the balance...

2509
02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:04.970
Make sure there's enough money

2510
02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:04.970
in there to make it worth your while.

2511
02:15:05.060 --> 02:15:06.180
Exactly.

2512
02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:09.520
You know, Carl, I think

2513
02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:09.520
this guy is pretty smart.

2514
02:15:10.020 --> 02:15:12.400
Guess all we have to do now

2515
02:15:10.020 --> 02:15:12.400
is catch him.
