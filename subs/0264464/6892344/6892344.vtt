00:46:03.095 --> 00:46:04.471
All right.

683
00:46:11.687 --> 00:46:13.605
I have plenty of money.

684
00:46:13.689 --> 00:46:16.024
You know, if you ever need anything.

685
00:46:16.149 --> 00:46:18.777
You worried? About me?

686
00:46:19.861 --> 00:46:21.780
No, I'm not worried.

687
00:46:21.863 --> 00:46:23.949
You think I can't buy my own car?

688
00:46:24.032 --> 00:46:27.369
Two mice fell in a bucket
of cream, Frank.

689
00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:29.955
Which one am I?

690
00:46:30.872 --> 00:46:32.958
You're that second mouse.

691
00:46:34.835 --> 00:46:36.962
I went by the store today.

692
00:46:38.297 --> 00:46:41.800
I had to close the store for a while.
It's all about timing, Frank.

693
00:46:41.883 --> 00:46:44.970
Goddamn government knows that.
They hit you when you're down.

694
00:46:45.053 --> 00:46:47.889
I wasn't going to let them take it
from me, so I just

695
00:46:48.015 --> 00:46:50.475
shut the doors myself, called their bluff.

696
00:46:55.564 --> 00:46:58.150
Sooner or later, they'll forget about me.

697
00:46:58.233 --> 00:46:59.735
I understand.

698
00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:03.238
Have you told Ma?

699
00:47:05.741 --> 00:47:08.827
She's so stubborn, your mother.

700
00:47:12.497 --> 00:47:15.500
Don't worry, I'm not going to let her go
without a fight.

701
00:47:15.584 --> 00:47:17.544

Daddy, out of all those men,

705
00:47:29.931 --> 00:47:32.601
you were the one that took her home,
remember that?

706
00:47:32.684 --> 00:47:34.019
Two hundred men

707
00:47:34.102 --> 00:47:37.606
sitting in that tiny social hall,
watching her dance.

708
00:47:40.275 --> 00:47:43.737
- What was the name of that town?
- Montrichard, Dad.

709
00:47:44.571 --> 00:47:46.782
I didn't speak a word of French,

710
00:47:46.865 --> 00:47:50.452
and six weeks later, she was my wife.

711
00:47:51.953 --> 00:47:53.622
She is your wife.

712
00:47:56.083 --> 00:48:00.462
My son bought me a Cadillac today.
I think that calls for a toast.

These are the most powerful people
in New York City.

718
00:48:28.281 --> 00:48:33.078
They keep peeking over their shoulders,
wondering where you're going tonight.

719
00:48:33.161 --> 00:48:35.038
Where you going, Frank?

720
00:48:35.122 --> 00:48:37.374
Dad, nobody's staring at me.

721
00:48:37.833 --> 00:48:39.584

722
00:48:41.878 --> 00:48:44.297
Just tell me where you're going.

725
00:48:53.223 --> 00:48:54.558

and these high heels, right?

728
00:49:09.239 --> 00:49:10.824
I got a bra out here.

729
00:49:10.907 --> 00:49:13.452
I'm chasing two Puerto Rican guys
through the park.

730
00:49:13.535 --> 00:49:16.121
They got a suitcase
filled with bank robbery loot.

731
00:49:16.204 --> 00:49:18.707
Okay, I'm screaming out,
"F.B.I., freeze!"

732
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:21.251
I'm reaching for my gun,
but I can't find it in the bra.

733
00:49:21.334 --> 00:49:23.962

That's a funny story.

736

Let me ask you a question,
Mr Amdursky.

737
00:49:32.762 --> 00:49:36.391
If you had so much fun undercover,
why did you transfer to bank fraud?

738
00:49:36.475 --> 00:49:39.769
I didn't transfer.
I was censured and reassigned.

739
00:49:40.353 --> 00:49:43.857
It's like being punished. I was punished.
I screwed up in the field.

740
00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:46.985
What about you, Mr Fox, were you
punished for screwing up in the field?

741
00:49:47.068 --> 00:49:49.279
No, I've never worked in the field before.

742
00:49:49.362 --> 00:49:50.906

744

That's just great. I ask for a team
and they drag the bottom of the Pacific.

745
00:49:58.705 --> 00:50:00.999
Mind if I ask you a question,
Agent Hanratty?

746
00:50:01.124 --> 00:50:02.667
How come you're so serious
all the time?

747
00:50:02.751 --> 00:50:05.337
Does it bother you, Mr Amdursky?

748
00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:07.464
Yeah, it does bother me.

749
00:50:07.797 --> 00:50:09.674
Does it bother you, Mr Fox?

750
00:50:09.758 --> 00:50:11.510
A little, I guess.

751

01:19:01.488 --> 01:19:03.573
He's over in Vietnam right now.

1192
01:19:03.657 --> 01:19:05.742
That kid is halfway around the world,

1193
01:19:05.825 --> 01:19:09.871
crawling through the damn jungle,
fighting the communists, so...

1194
01:19:11.331 --> 01:19:15.335
Please, don't come to my home
and call my boy a criminal...

1195
01:19:15.585 --> 01:19:19.339
I never said he was a criminal,
Mr Abagnale. I said he was in trouble.

1196
01:19:20.799 --> 01:19:24.135
If you'd like to give me a call and talk,
here's my number.

1197
01:19:36.564 --> 01:19:38.525

1198
01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:41.736
Pardon me?

1199
01:19:41.861 --> 01:19:44.155
If you were a father, you'd know.

1200
01:19:44.239 --> 01:19:49.703
I would never give up my son.
I would never give up my son.

1201
01:19:51.705 --> 01:19:53.748
Yes, sir. I understand.

1202
01:19:54.708 --> 01:19:56.543

the team in four hours. Bye-bye!

- Come on, it's okay.

I'm sorry! I'm so sorry, Frank!
I can't do this.

Brenda, listen to me.

1210
01:20:23.236 --> 01:20:25.363
I don't care if you're a virgin, all right?

1211
01:20:25.447 --> 01:20:26.698
Really, I can wait.

1212
01:20:27.907 --> 01:20:29.617
I'm not a virgin.

1213
01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:36.499
I had an abortion two years ago.

1214
01:20:40.086 --> 01:20:42.589
My parents had a friend do it.

1215
01:20:43.089 --> 01:20:46.301
A man that my father plays golf with.

1216
01:20:47.802 --> 01:20:51.014
And when I got better,
they kicked me out of the house.

1217
01:20:51.931 --> 01:20:55.477
(SOBBING) I had an abortion
and I wasn't their daughter any more!

1218
01:20:56.311 --> 01:20:59.272
I'm so sorry. Please don't be mad at me.

No, no.

- Please don't be mad at me.
- Shh.

1221
01:21:06.446 --> 01:21:08.948
What if I spoke to your parents?

1222
01:21:09.115 --> 01:21:11.284
Maybe I can straighten things out.

1223
01:21:11.368 --> 01:21:14.954
I ask them all the time,
but they said I still can't come home.

1224
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:18.958
And my daddy's a lawyer.

1226
01:21:31.137 --> 01:21:33.848
What if you were engaged to a doctor?

1227
01:21:34.516 --> 01:21:36.393
Would that change anything?

1228
01:21:36.476 --> 01:21:37.727
What?

1229
01:21:41.523 --> 01:21:44.025
What if I went to your parents,

1230
01:21:45.485 --> 01:21:47.821
and I spoke to your father

1231
01:21:51.074 --> 01:21:53.701
and I asked permission to marry you?

1232
01:22:07.424 --> 01:22:09.843

Two little mice fell
into a bucket of cream.

1242
01:23:10.737 --> 01:23:12.822
The first mouse
quickly gave up and drowned,

1243
01:23:12.906 --> 01:23:14.741
but the second mouse struggled so hard

1244
01:23:14.824 --> 01:23:17.452
that he eventually churned
that cream into butter,

1245
01:23:18.244 --> 01:23:19.704
and he walked out.

01:23:21.247 --> 01:23:22.248
Amen.

Frank, have you decided which hospital
you want to work at in New Orleans?

1252
01:23:41.935 --> 01:23:45.563
To be quite honest,
I'm thinking about getting back into law.

1253
01:23:46.356 --> 01:23:49.108
Oh, my! Are you a doctor or a lawyer?

1254
01:23:49.943 --> 01:23:53.363
Before I went to medical school,
I passed the bar in California.

1255
01:23:53.446 --> 01:23:56.199
I practised law for one year,
then I decided,

1256

why not try my hand at paediatrics?

and holes in my shoes

to ask me.

in Louisiana?

No.

Your Honour,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

1343
01:30:07.236 --> 01:30:11.532

Mr Conners,
this is a preliminary hearing.

01:32:36.218 --> 01:32:37.970
I came to see you.

1363
01:32:42.141 --> 01:32:44.060
What are you doing dressed like this?

1364
01:32:44.143 --> 01:32:46.103
I took a government job.

1365
01:32:46.228 --> 01:32:49.607
You see what I'm doing?
Do you have a good lawyer?

1366
01:32:50.858 --> 01:32:52.359
I sort of am a lawyer now.

1367
01:32:52.443 --> 01:32:54.987
Look at this letter. The IRS wants more.

1368
01:32:55.946 --> 01:32:58.491
I had a deal with them. Two penalties.

1369
01:32:58.574 --> 01:33:01.243
They ate the cake,
now they want the crumbs.

1370
01:33:01.952 --> 01:33:03.579
I want to sue them.

1371
01:33:04.747 --> 01:33:06.832
Now they want the crumbs.

1372
01:33:08.584 --> 01:33:09.835
Sit down.

1373
01:33:09.919 --> 01:33:13.172
They're trying to scare me,
intimidate me. You know what?

1374
01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:16.217
You know what?

1375
01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:18.344
I'll make them chase me

1376
01:33:18.928 --> 01:33:21.180
for the rest of their lives!

1377
01:33:28.145 --> 01:33:30.231
It's great to see you, Daddy.

1378
01:33:32.066 --> 01:33:34.485
Sit down, I want to show you something.

1379
01:33:36.904 --> 01:33:39.198
I came here to give you this.

1380
01:33:39.281 --> 01:33:42.243
It's an invitation to an engagement party.

1381
01:33:44.995 --> 01:33:47.206
Daddy, I'm getting married.

1382
01:33:47.998 --> 01:33:50.209
Can you believe that
I'm getting married?

1383
01:33:50.292 --> 01:33:53.587
You don't need to worry
about anything now, Dad. Listen.

1384
01:33:53.671 --> 01:33:57.299
I'm getting a brand-new Cadillac,
I'm getting a $60,000 house,

1385
01:33:57.383 --> 01:33:59.093
I'm getting it all back.

1386
01:33:59.218 --> 01:34:03.973
All the jewellery, the furs, everything
they took from us, I'll get it back.

1387
01:34:07.351 --> 01:34:09.311
Has Ma seen you dressed like this?

1388
01:34:10.896 --> 01:34:13.107
Yeah, she came to pick up some boxes.

1389
01:34:13.524 --> 01:34:15.317
That's okay. You know why?

1390
01:34:15.401 --> 01:34:17.736
Because she's going to the wedding
with us.

1391
01:34:17.862 --> 01:34:20.197
I'm gonna get you
a brand-new suit, Dad.

1392
01:34:20.656 --> 01:34:23.159
One of those Manhattan Eagle,
three-button black pearl suits.

1393
01:34:23.242 --> 01:34:24.326
You'll look great.

1394
01:34:24.410 --> 01:34:26.912
Those are nice. She won't see me.

1395
01:34:29.456 --> 01:34:31.667
Have you tried to call her?

1396
01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:35.963
Why don't you call her right now?

1397
01:34:36.338 --> 01:34:38.257
Why don't you call her right now?

1398
01:34:38.549 --> 01:34:40.050
Dad, just call her.

1399
01:34:40.134 --> 01:34:41.677
Call her for me.

1400
01:34:41.927 --> 01:34:45.639
Tell her I have two first-class tickets
to go see her son's wedding...

1401
01:34:45.723 --> 01:34:47.600
You mother's married now
to my friend, Jack Barnes.

1402
01:34:47.683 --> 01:34:50.436
They have a house in Long Island.

1403
01:34:51.604 --> 01:34:54.273
I had an F.B.I. agent come see me.

1404
01:34:55.524 --> 01:34:58.819
You got their number, son.
The guy looked scared.

1405
01:34:59.361 --> 01:35:03.157
The United States Government, champ,
running for the hills.

Pow! To the moon!

1407
01:35:17.046 --> 01:35:18.047
Dad.

1408
01:35:19.215 --> 01:35:20.633
It's over.

1409
01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:23.177
I'm going to stop now.

1410
01:35:26.347 --> 01:35:28.140
They're never gonna catch you, Frank.

1411
01:35:28.224 --> 01:35:31.685
She wouldn't do that!
Why would she do that to you?

1412
01:35:31.852 --> 01:35:34.772
Come on. Sit with me. Have a drink.
I'm your father.

1413
01:35:36.232 --> 01:35:40.444
Then ask me to stop.
Then ask me to stop.

1414
01:35:43.781 --> 01:35:45.366
You can't stop.

1415
01:35:47.952 --> 01:35:49.954
Where are you going?

1416
01:35:50.037 --> 01:35:52.373
Come on, Frank, where are you going?

Where are you going tonight?

1418

Okay.

1432
01:36:50.889 --> 01:36:52.766
I want it to be over.

1433
01:36:57.396 --> 01:37:00.232
I want it to be over. I'm getting married.

1434
01:37:00.774 --> 01:37:02.401
I'm settling down.

1435
01:37:02.484 --> 01:37:04.737
You've stolen almost $4 million.

1436
01:37:04.987 --> 01:37:07.281
You think we could call it
a wedding present?

1437
01:37:07.364 --> 01:37:09.658
This isn't something
you get to walk away from, Frank.

1438
01:37:09.742 --> 01:37:12.119
- I want to call a truce.
<i>- No truce.</i>

I'm getting close, aren't I?

1443
01:37:23.339 --> 01:37:25.966
You're scared because
I'm getting close. I know

1444
01:37:26.050 --> 01:37:30.262
you rented a car in Shreveport,
stayed in a hotel on Lake Charles.

Uh-uh. He can't change it.

- Not at all. What can I do for you?

I'd like to meet the groom.

Frank! Can you hold all these?

01:39:43.479 --> 01:39:45.439
They're checks.
They're from my dad's friends.

or poor, or if I had a different name.

all that money?

But we all have secrets.

of the United States you wouldn't run.

1864
02:11:28.548 --> 02:11:30.300
Why did you do it?

1865
02:11:31.009 --> 02:11:33.720
- You're just a kid.
- I'm not your kid.

1866
02:11:34.137 --> 02:11:36.515
You said you were going to Chicago.

1867
02:11:36.681 --> 02:11:40.477
My daughter can't see me this weekend.
She's going skiing.

1868
02:11:41.019 --> 02:11:43.313
You said she was four years old.
You're lying.

1869
02:11:43.397 --> 02:11:46.191
She was four when I left. Now she's 15.

1870
02:11:46.691 --> 02:11:49.569
My wife has been remarried
for 11 years.

1871
02:11:49.653 --> 02:11:52.072
I see Grace every now and again.

1872
02:11:52.823 --> 02:11:55.325
- I don't understand.
- Sure you do.

1873
02:11:56.159 --> 02:11:58.870
Sometimes it's easier living the lie.

1874
02:12:02.165 --> 02:12:04.501
I'm gonna let you fly tonight, Frank.

1875
02:12:05.335 --> 02:12:09.506
I won't even try to stop you, because
I know you'll be back on Monday.

1876
02:12:09.589 --> 02:12:10.757
Yeah.

1877
02:12:11.258 --> 02:12:13.677
- How do you know I'll come back?
- (CHUCKLES)

1878
02:12:16.054 --> 02:12:17.180
Look.

1879
02:12:18.223 --> 02:12:19.391
Frank.

1880
02:12:19.724 --> 02:12:21.685
Nobody is chasing you.

1881
02:12:42.122 --> 02:12:44.541
Alice, has he still not called?

1882
02:12:44.624 --> 02:12:46.209
No, he hasn't.

1883
02:12:57.721 --> 02:12:59.014
CARL: <i>Good morning.</i>

1884
02:12:59.097 --> 02:13:01.141
I've called this meeting to discuss

1885
02:13:01.224 --> 02:13:03.560
a new type of cheque fraud
and counterfeiting.

1886
02:13:03.643 --> 02:13:05.854
The unsub is washing
and altering checks,

1887
02:13:05.937 --> 02:13:07.522
then passing them throughout Arizona.

1888
02:13:12.235 --> 02:13:16.364
This unsub is a big dog,
passing cheques as large as five figures.

1889
02:13:16.448 --> 02:13:18.074
(DOOR OPENING)

1890
02:13:19.784 --> 02:13:21.411
Sorry I'm late.

1891
02:13:22.704 --> 02:13:23.914
Sorry.

1892
02:13:28.126 --> 02:13:31.004
We have a recovered cheque
on Agent Reiter's desk.

1893
02:13:31.087 --> 02:13:33.798
Why don't we step out to the bullpen?

1894
02:13:38.220 --> 02:13:40.764
There's impressions on every line.

1895
02:13:42.432 --> 02:13:45.435
Looks like the original amount
was for $60.

1896
02:13:48.980 --> 02:13:50.899
Mind if I take a look?

1897
02:13:53.985 --> 02:13:56.404
Cashed in Flagstaff a week ago.

1898
02:13:59.157 --> 02:14:01.243
Cost the bank $16,000.

1899
02:14:02.911 --> 02:14:04.955
- It's a real cheque.
- Yeah.

1900
02:14:05.622 --> 02:14:09.042
It's been washed.
The only thing original is the signature.

1901
02:14:09.125 --> 02:14:10.835
But it's perfect.

1902
02:14:11.253 --> 02:14:14.172
I mean, this isn't hydrochloride
or bleach.

1903
02:14:14.339 --> 02:14:15.465
No.

1904
02:14:15.590 --> 02:14:17.133
Something new.

1905
02:14:17.300 --> 02:14:22.305
A nail polish remover where the acetone
removes the ink that's not been printed?

1906
02:14:25.433 --> 02:14:27.227
How did you do it, Frank?

1907
02:14:28.645 --> 02:14:31.815
How did you cheat on the bar exam
in Louisiana?

1908
02:14:36.987 --> 02:14:38.613
I didn't cheat.

1909
02:14:40.156 --> 02:14:42.867
I studied for two weeks and I passed.

1910
02:14:44.995 --> 02:14:46.788
Is that the truth?

1911
02:14:47.664 --> 02:14:48.707
Is that the truth?

1912
02:14:48.790 --> 02:14:51.960
I'll bet this guy steals cheques
out of mailboxes.

1913
02:14:52.043 --> 02:14:55.171
He washes off their names
and puts on his own.

1914
02:14:56.631 --> 02:14:58.758
You're saying he's a local?

1915
02:14:58.842 --> 02:15:02.596
If it were me, I'd call the bank first.
Check out the balance...

1916
02:15:02.679 --> 02:15:04.973
Make sure there's enough money
in there to make it worth your while.

1917
02:15:05.056 --> 02:15:06.182
Exactly.

1918
02:15:06.516 --> 02:15:09.519
You know, Carl, I think
this guy is pretty smart.

1919
02:15:10.020 --> 02:15:12.397
Guess all we have to do now
is catch him.
