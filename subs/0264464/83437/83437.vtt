00:00:12,323 --> 00:00:15,258
Look lively, ye filthy dogs!

4
00:00:15,293 --> 00:00:17,861
Keel the jibs!
Shiver the timbers!

5
00:00:17,896 --> 00:00:21,264
- Fire the cannons!
- We are.

6
00:00:21,299 --> 00:00:23,867
- Oh, is that what that noise is?
- Yaaarrrbo!

7
00:00:23,868 --> 00:00:27,303
It's high time I split your
carcass from crown to crotch.

8
00:00:28,406 --> 00:00:30,939
Bring it on, Fat Beard!

9
00:00:30,975 --> 00:00:32,942
Fat Beard?
I don't have a beard.

10
00:00:32,943 --> 00:00:35,479
- Distracted you!
- Ow! What the hell?

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,046
Jeez, Hank, it's
a game of Battleship,

12
00:00:38,082 --> 00:00:40,984
- not friggin' Karateship!
- Sorry, Brent.

13
00:00:40,985 --> 00:00:42,451
My imagination got away from me.

14
00:00:42,452 --> 00:00:45,254
You shouted "Fat Beard".
What does that mean?

15
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:46,989
No, I said... Bat beard.

16
00:00:47,024 --> 00:00:49,892
Like, uh, Batman...
with whiskers.

17
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,994
Well, that makes sense, then.

<b>1x08 - Rum Punch</b>

21
00:01:03,006 --> 00:01:05,474
Sorry again about punching
you in the noggin earlier.

22
00:01:05,475 --> 00:01:07,009
Ah, no biggie.

23
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,945
Did you just use the term "no
biggie" in relation to your head?

24
00:01:09,946 --> 00:01:12,580
I'm just glad we weren't
playing Hungry Hungry Hippos.

25
00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:14,348
You might've sacked me
in the marbles.

26
00:01:14,383 --> 00:01:15,550
Did you just use the term "marbles"

27
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:18,120
- in relation to your...
- Whatcha talking about, guys?

28
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:19,688
Hank punched Brent in the nose.

29
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:21,690
- Really?
- So you showed up just in time

30
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:23,158
to see Brent punch Hank.

31
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,193
- What?
- What?

32
00:01:24,194 --> 00:01:27,362
If Brent doesn't punch
Hank back, this will fester.

33
00:01:27,363 --> 00:01:30,931
It'll rot away at your souls
like a case of soul-rot.

34
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:33,702
Oh no.
I-I don't want soul-rot!

35
00:01:33,703 --> 00:01:35,536
I also don't want to get punched.

36
00:01:35,571 --> 00:01:38,105
Oh, relax, Hank.
Brent's not going to...

37
00:01:38,106 --> 00:01:41,174
Wanda makes a strong point,
Hank, so to save our friendship,

38
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,243
I will punch you square in the face.

39
00:01:45,047 --> 00:01:47,081
Aw, dammit.
Okay.

40
00:01:47,082 --> 00:01:49,616
Put 'Er there, pal.
Make it quick.

41
00:01:49,617 --> 00:01:51,685
Oh, no, no.
Not now.

42
00:01:51,686 --> 00:01:54,888
Not tonight, but someday...

43
00:01:56,624 --> 00:02:01,227
soon... and you'll never
know when it's coming.

44
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,430
<i> Here's to fall 'n' friends!</i>

45
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:07,700
Yeah, hard to believe
Wes passed away.

46
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:10,036
Wes is dead?
Since when?

47
00:02:10,037 --> 00:02:11,405
I thought that's what you were toasting.

48
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:12,673
You said "fallen" friends.

49
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,475
We were saying
"fall" and "friends",

50
00:02:15,543 --> 00:02:17,210
like autumn and camaraderie.

51
00:02:17,211 --> 00:02:18,711
But sure, Wes was a good guy.

52
00:02:18,712 --> 00:02:21,713
We all have
our favourite Wes memories.

53
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:26,052
Hey, Wes.
Gimme a case of Pil.

54
00:02:26,053 --> 00:02:29,022
- A 26 of gin, please.
- Purse-sized vodka.

55
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,723
<i>Tequila grande, por favor!</i>

56
00:02:30,758 --> 00:02:33,091
Did I leave my gloves in here?

57
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:35,294
Yep...
great guy, ol' Wes.

58
00:02:35,295 --> 00:02:38,296
Yeah, when he wasn't
stealing your gloves.

59
00:02:38,365 --> 00:02:40,999
I heard he barely left anything
for his widow.

60
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:43,403
How does a guy who ran a
liquor and insurance store

61
00:02:43,404 --> 00:02:44,737
not have any life insurance?

62
00:02:44,738 --> 00:02:48,039
Someone call Alanis
and tell her that's ironic.

63
00:02:48,074 --> 00:02:51,277
Good lord, that was the '90s.
Get over it already!

64
00:02:51,278 --> 00:02:53,212
- Is... Is that...
- That's Shirley.

65
00:02:53,213 --> 00:02:56,148
She's a huge Alanis fan.
Even dresses like her.

66
00:02:56,149 --> 00:02:59,284
So, to be clear, you're saying
that is not Alanis Morissette.

67
00:02:59,286 --> 00:03:01,986
In my legal opinion, no.

68
00:03:02,055 --> 00:03:03,522
Well, I'm just glad Oscar and I

69
00:03:03,523 --> 00:03:06,525
- have a good life insurance policy.
- Life insurance?

70
00:03:06,526 --> 00:03:09,294
- I cancelled that.
- Without discussing it with me?

71
00:03:09,295 --> 00:03:12,996
We're discussing it now.
Life insurance is a scam.

72
00:03:13,065 --> 00:03:14,499
Now if you want to kill me
in my sleep,

73
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,803
- maybe you'll think twice.
- Twice at the most.

74
00:03:17,804 --> 00:03:19,670
We should have a fundraiser
for Wes' widow.

75
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:22,140
- We should?
- Well, of course.

76
00:03:22,141 --> 00:03:24,836
Isn't that how things work
in a small town?

77
00:03:25,311 --> 00:03:26,477
Then it's settled.

78
00:03:26,478 --> 00:03:29,613
- To Wes' widow!
- To Wes' widow.

79
00:03:29,614 --> 00:03:30,614
- Oh, sure.
- Yeah.

80
00:03:30,615 --> 00:03:32,150
- Well, I guess so.
- Widow.

81
00:03:35,821 --> 00:03:39,489
Ugh. These new uniforms
are so thick and starchy,

82
00:03:39,524 --> 00:03:42,492
they're practically
Lacey's soup of the day.

83
00:03:42,527 --> 00:03:45,495
- Yours bugging you too?
- No. I gotta pee.

84
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,331
Fine. I'll pull over
and you can go in the ditch.

85
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,166
Isn't that the best part
of being a guy?

86
00:03:50,168 --> 00:03:52,802
That, and the higher pay
for no particular reason.

87
00:03:54,673 --> 00:03:57,606
Why is this taking so long?

88
00:03:57,641 --> 00:04:00,376
I can't go with you talking to me.

89
00:04:00,445 --> 00:04:03,346
I didn't realize
you had such a shy bladder.

90
00:04:03,348 --> 00:04:05,202
Do you realize
you're still talking to me?

91
00:04:05,273 --> 00:04:07,451
Go off into those trees, then.

92
00:04:07,452 --> 00:04:10,252
Unless you're scared a
squirrel might catch a peek.

93
00:04:24,869 --> 00:04:28,137
- Hey. Brent here?
- I don't know. Probably.

94
00:04:28,138 --> 00:04:29,338
He owns the joint.

95
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:30,539
He's gonna pop out
from behind something

96
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,541
and punch me square
in the face, isn't he?

97
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:33,509
Here's hoping.

98
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,378
- Morning, Hank.
- Ahh!

99
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:36,612
Bit jumpy, aren't you?

100
00:04:36,613 --> 00:04:38,147
Yeah, you would be too
if you knew

101
00:04:38,148 --> 00:04:39,315
your best friend was gonna
punch you in the face

102
00:04:39,316 --> 00:04:43,151
- at any moment.
- Oh yeah. I forgot about that.

103
00:04:43,186 --> 00:04:44,720
Ah, well... all in good time.

104
00:04:44,721 --> 00:04:46,521
No need to rush into
these things when...

105
00:04:46,556 --> 00:04:47,455
Aah!

106
00:04:47,456 --> 00:04:50,625
Relax. I was just reaching
for a bag of chips.

107
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,527
Ah, you're just trying
to freak me out.

108
00:04:52,595 --> 00:04:55,263
No, I'm not.
Now, just lean in a bit,

109
00:04:55,264 --> 00:04:58,433
because my new puppet, Mr. Fister,
wants to tell you a secret.

110
00:04:58,434 --> 00:05:00,435
Heya, Hank.
Give us a kiss.

111
00:05:00,436 --> 00:05:02,703
Forget it, Fister!

112
00:05:02,704 --> 00:05:05,407
This is working out wonderfully.

113
00:05:05,408 --> 00:05:07,241
Yeah, except you might
want to change the name

114
00:05:07,276 --> 00:05:10,577
- of Mr. Fister.
- Why? It rhymes.

115
00:05:11,847 --> 00:05:14,515
Jeez, how long does it take to...

116
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,385
Davis!
Let's go!

117
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:20,887
Are you having zipper trouble, or...
Oop!

118
00:05:20,923 --> 00:05:26,226
- An old-fashioned booze still?
- Yep. Rum, I think.

119
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:27,361
So you're just helping yourself?

120
00:05:27,362 --> 00:05:30,597
Had to fire it up to see if it works.
Not illegal unless it works.

121
00:05:30,632 --> 00:05:33,868
- I guess that makes sense.
- You might want to get up.

122
00:05:33,869 --> 00:05:35,668
That's right around where I peed.

123
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:39,605
I can't believe Oscar
cancelled our life insurance.

124
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,509
Now I have to re-apply.
What if he drops dead before then?

125
00:05:43,578 --> 00:05:46,480
What if, Heaven forbid,
you go before Oscar?

126
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:48,814
I've never been lucky that way.

127
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:51,551
Hey, how are the fundraising
ideas coming along

128
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:54,070
- for Wes' widow?
- All the good fundraising ideas

129
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:54,920
have been done in town.

130
00:05:54,956 --> 00:05:57,957
<i> Dunk tank
to help drought victims!</i>

131
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,726
Bake sale to fight diabetes!

132
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:04,262
Barn burning to raise
money for a barn raising!

133
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:07,665
I don't get how burning
a barn even raises money.

134
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,268
It's complicated.

135
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:11,803
The fundraisers all seem
a little weirdly ironic,

136
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,539
- don't you think?
- You know what would be ironic?

137
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:18,643
A double murder in a small
town with no witnesses!

138
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:21,347
- Not really.
- Dammit!

139
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:24,849
Anyway... I'll probably just
end up doing a 50/50 draw.

140
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:27,653
50/50 draw?
Those are a scam!

141
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:29,321
Everything's a scam to you.

142
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,455
Lacey, I'll gladly give you a hand

143
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,925
if it'll help Wes' widow
and annoy Oscar.

144
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,812
Well, that's great! Oh,
we can do three tickets

145
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,664
for five bucks, or 20
bucks for an arm's length.

146
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,333
Offer not available
to Long-Arm Charlie.

147
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:45,336
- Why not?
- Oof!

148
00:06:47,806 --> 00:06:50,342
- Oh, hi, Emma.
- Hi, Fitzy.

149
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,610
We're raising money
to help Wes' widow.

150
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:55,013
You bet! Anything I can
do to help out a widow.

151
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:58,649
So you'd donate money
to me if Oscar died?

152
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:01,351
Hang on, it sounds
like this is for you.

153
00:07:01,386 --> 00:07:04,721
- I was just asking.
- This feels like a trap.

154
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,990
You mean you'd help her
but not me?

155
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,394
Because that's what it sounds like!

156
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:16,232
I'm burning up
in this stupid uniform.

157
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:17,701
I think it's asbestos!

158
00:07:17,702 --> 00:07:20,970
If it's asbestos,
you can't burn, genius!

159
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:22,673
I'm going to town for some bottles.

160
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:23,840
What do we need bottles for?

161
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:25,708
We need to do a proper inventory

162
00:07:25,743 --> 00:07:29,412
of exactly how much illegality
is going on here.

163
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:31,048
Why don't I go into town
for the bottles,

164
00:07:31,049 --> 00:07:34,885
and you stay here and test the
rum to see what proof it is?

165
00:07:34,886 --> 00:07:38,287
Because a higher proof
makes it more illegal.

166
00:07:38,355 --> 00:07:40,822
Nice work, rookie.

167
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:45,327
One... two... three...

168
00:07:45,362 --> 00:07:46,063
Aah!

169
00:07:46,064 --> 00:07:47,930
Three.
Aah!

170
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:50,866
And how is this going, whatever
this is that you're doing?

171
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:52,734
I'm trying to prepare
for Brent's punch

172
00:07:52,736 --> 00:07:55,871
by punching myself in the face,
but I'm too good at ducking.

173
00:07:55,872 --> 00:07:58,007
- Aah!
- Oof!

174
00:07:58,008 --> 00:08:00,910
- Come on!
- Oh, this is ridiculous.

175
00:08:00,911 --> 00:08:03,579
- Nobody's going to punch you.
- Better safe than sorry.

176
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,381
You probably should build
up a good face-callous.

177
00:08:06,382 --> 00:08:08,082
Here, let me draw you a target.

178
00:08:09,052 --> 00:08:12,420
- Oh...
- A target, huh?

179
00:08:12,422 --> 00:08:14,889
You just gave me a better idea.

180
00:08:14,925 --> 00:08:18,928
- Better than punching yourself?
- Okay, everyone.

181
00:08:18,929 --> 00:08:20,961
We're starting a 50/50 draw
to help Wes' widow.

182
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,481
There's word going around
these 50/50 draws

183
00:08:23,482 --> 00:08:24,865
are a Ponzi scheme.

184
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,000
It's not a Ponzi scheme!
It's simple.

185
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:28,570
If you win, you get
50% of the money.

186
00:08:28,571 --> 00:08:31,707
- Don't like those odds.
- Look, I'll start things off

187
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,943
by buying a wingspan for myself.
Who's next?

188
00:08:34,944 --> 00:08:38,578
Not fair if you can't
even use your own arms!

189
00:08:38,614 --> 00:08:40,914
I heard it's some kind of scheme.

190
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,951
You heard it from him!
Oh!

191
00:08:42,952 --> 00:08:45,987
- What are you gonna do?
- Just watch.

192
00:08:45,988 --> 00:08:48,990
High-five if your favourite kind
of dog is a chili-cheese dog.

193
00:08:48,991 --> 00:08:50,691
I heard that!

194
00:08:54,563 --> 00:08:56,830
Ha! You hit me!
Now we're even!

195
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,099
What?
No way. That's not fair!

196
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,402
Fair schmair, buddy boy.
It's all over.

197
00:09:01,403 --> 00:09:02,744
You're my witness, Wanda.

198
00:09:02,745 --> 00:09:04,639
Witness to what?
That was a slap.

199
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,141
She's right.
A slap isn't a punch.

200
00:09:07,142 --> 00:09:08,908
I mean, babies get slapped
when they're five seconds old.

201
00:09:08,943 --> 00:09:11,477
You ever see a doctor
punch a baby?

202
00:09:13,256 --> 00:09:15,816
Are we doing this, or what?

203
00:09:15,817 --> 00:09:17,151
I can't even imagine it.

204
00:09:17,152 --> 00:09:19,618
No, we're back at square one,
like Wanda said.

205
00:09:19,654 --> 00:09:22,789
Well... I didn't say that.
You still owe Hank a punch.

206
00:09:22,824 --> 00:09:25,825
- But now Hank owes you a slap.
- Oh-ho-ho, baby!

207
00:09:25,826 --> 00:09:28,662
I get to slap that big meaty mug
whenever I want.

208
00:09:28,663 --> 00:09:32,081
- This is gonna be great.
- It'll be the greatest spectacle

209
00:09:32,082 --> 00:09:35,218
in the history of Dog River,
and I shall call it...

210
00:09:35,219 --> 00:09:38,872
Slappunchalooza!

211
00:09:39,807 --> 00:09:42,674
Slap-punch a loser.
Get it?

212
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:46,752
- No.
- Yeah, well, you simpleton.

213
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:54,032
Mm, yep, at least 80 proof.

214
00:09:54,068 --> 00:09:59,070
- You've been a naughty boy.
- I'm back, and I brought these.

215
00:09:59,105 --> 00:10:01,172
We don't want our uniforms
smelling like booze

216
00:10:01,207 --> 00:10:02,742
when we bring it
to the evidence locker.

217
00:10:02,743 --> 00:10:06,579
You're really thinking like
a senior officer today, Karen.

218
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,681
- Put this on too.
- Why?

219
00:10:08,682 --> 00:10:10,048
It came with the overalls.

220
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:12,316
<i>...could punch someone too...</i>

221
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,665
- Brent.
- Hank.

222
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,533
Lovely weather we're having.

223
00:10:29,568 --> 00:10:32,303
- Fair to middling.
- Radio was saying

224
00:10:32,304 --> 00:10:36,240
we might get a bit of rain
in the... south!

225
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:37,642
<i> Aww...</i>

226
00:10:37,643 --> 00:10:40,478
You're pointing north.
Just so you know,

227
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:42,179
I'm not worried
about your little slap.

228
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,014
You ever hear the term
"slap on the wrist"?

229
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:46,683
It literally means "a soft,
insignificant punishment

230
00:10:46,752 --> 00:10:49,352
doled out by a simpleton
in a backward ballcap".

231
00:10:49,388 --> 00:10:52,555
Yeah, well, "punch" means
a fruity refreshing drink,

232
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:57,028
- so I'm not worried either.
- Papaya!

233
00:10:57,029 --> 00:10:59,463
<i>- Aww.
- Come on.</i>

234
00:10:59,464 --> 00:11:01,431
You okay, pal? Huh?

235
00:11:01,466 --> 00:11:04,234
We've got adult diapers
next door if you need 'em.

236
00:11:04,235 --> 00:11:05,935
I've got my own.

237
00:11:06,504 --> 00:11:08,806
Wanda, what's this nonsense
about Brent and Hank

238
00:11:08,807 --> 00:11:10,740
and the slapping
and the punching?

239
00:11:10,775 --> 00:11:13,109
- How'd you hear about that?
- From your mass text.

240
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,145
Good.
I was hoping that would work.

241
00:11:15,146 --> 00:11:16,379
It's been fun so far.

242
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,314
Well, it's disrupting town business.

243
00:11:18,316 --> 00:11:21,000
I had to wait five minutes
at the Foo Mart because Won Hu

244
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:23,685
was betting on who would
punch or slap who first.

245
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,822
- Who put money on who?
- Eventually.

246
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,123
So... people are betting?

247
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,659
Keep 'em coming, boys!

248
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,360
20 on Hank
slapping Brent first.

249
00:11:31,395 --> 00:11:34,331
- 40 says Brent punches that loser.
- Yes!

250
00:11:34,332 --> 00:11:38,120
Slappunchalooza!
Get it?

251
00:11:38,502 --> 00:11:42,137
Wasting my genius here.
Who's next?

252
00:11:42,138 --> 00:11:44,305
Hey, Wanda,
want to buy a 50/50 ticket?

253
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:46,676
Can't. No cash.

254
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,214
Oh, hey, Brent.

255
00:11:52,215 --> 00:11:53,782
You know what I was thinking?

256
00:11:53,783 --> 00:11:55,717
- You wish you were taller?
- No.

257
00:11:55,718 --> 00:11:56,685
Well, then, I got nothing.

258
00:11:56,686 --> 00:11:59,271
I was thinking
that you should punch Hank

259
00:11:59,272 --> 00:12:01,656
in front of the whole town,
make a meal out of it.

260
00:12:01,657 --> 00:12:03,325
Well, I am always intrigued
by the notion of a meal,

261
00:12:03,326 --> 00:12:05,559
but I'm having way too much fun
toying with Hank's mind,

262
00:12:05,628 --> 00:12:07,626
- such as it is.
- Come on,

263
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:08,864
we could make it
a public boxing match.

264
00:12:08,865 --> 00:12:11,399
- Charge for tickets.
- Seriously?

265
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,367
I mean, hasn't the boxing trope

266
00:12:12,368 --> 00:12:15,335
been done a thousand times
in every lame sitcom?

267
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:16,872
Which this is not.

268
00:12:16,873 --> 00:12:18,772
How about,
instead of a boxing ring,

269
00:12:18,841 --> 00:12:20,641
we make it a fighting cage?

270
00:12:20,676 --> 00:12:23,677
Ooh, a refreshing new wrinkle.

271
00:12:24,914 --> 00:12:26,447
That's the last one.

272
00:12:26,448 --> 00:12:27,915
Let's bring this load
back to the station

273
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:31,585
- and wrap this case up.
- Wait! Um...

274
00:12:31,586 --> 00:12:33,553
don't these bottles need labels?

275
00:12:33,588 --> 00:12:36,156
Something that indicates
what the evidence is

276
00:12:36,191 --> 00:12:39,226
and which hero officer seized it?

277
00:12:39,228 --> 00:12:43,262
I'll go make some labels.
You are sharp as a tack today!

278
00:12:43,331 --> 00:12:45,297
Good thing you aren't.

279
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:56,108
Wanda, how'd you
build this so fast?

280
00:12:56,144 --> 00:12:58,245
Dunno.
Lately I feel unrestrained

281
00:12:58,246 --> 00:12:59,879
by the limitations of real life.

282
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,381
Well, I need to sell
my 50/50 tickets,

283
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:05,752
- so I hope people show up.
- Don't worry. They will.

284
00:13:10,591 --> 00:13:14,360
Wow.
How did you know they'd come?

285
00:13:14,395 --> 00:13:16,629
It's a sporting event.
In a cornfield.

286
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,830
Don't make me say it.

287
00:13:20,434 --> 00:13:22,734
Ladies and gentlemen!

288
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:27,639
Welcome to the first annual
Dog River Slappunchalooza!

289
00:13:28,943 --> 00:13:33,412
Did you all sleep through the '90s?
Fine.

290
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:36,398
In this corner, weighing in
at less than a 10-year-old

291
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,384
girl with food poisoning,
Hank "The Septic Tank" Yarbo!

292
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,353
Hey!

293
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:42,621
Suck it up, jackass.

294
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:45,256
I've got 20 riding
on you slapping Brent first.

295
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,292
But if I slap first,
that'll make him mad,

296
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:48,461
and he'll punch me harder.

297
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:51,462
Hope so.
I got 50 riding on that.

298
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,899
And in this corner, weighing in

299
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,667
at "Let's go swimming
but keep our T-shirts on",

300
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,936
Brent "The Cement" Leroy.

301
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:02,439
The Cement? I can't tell
if that's an insult or not,

302
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:05,443
- but the T-shirt thing was, right?
- Assume it is.

303
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:08,312
Use the rage, and remember
to keep your chin up

304
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,615
- and your wallet open.
- Wallet open?

305
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:11,983
Want to buy some 50/50 tickets?

306
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,319
I'm kind of busy right now.

307
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,186
All right, no one leaves the cage

308
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,655
until someone
has been slapped or punched.

309
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,493
I might need to see several slaps
and multiple punches

310
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:25,399
before I can call a winner,
so get in there and mix it up!

311
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:27,597
All right,
this has gone far enough.

312
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,299
How about you slap me first
and I'll let you win?

313
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:33,236
Oh, you'd like that,
wouldn't you, Mr. Fister?

314
00:14:33,304 --> 00:14:34,839
Wow.
That does sound wrong.

315
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,340
<i> Fight! Fight! Fight!</i>

316
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:38,841
<i>Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight...</i>

317
00:14:38,876 --> 00:14:40,843
Looks like we're going
to be here a while.

318
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:42,678
Last one.

319
00:14:42,713 --> 00:14:45,814
Let's get these loaded up in
the car and back to the station.

320
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,485
Damn!
I-I mean, damn fine work.

321
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:53,023
"Sergeant Davis' Spiced Evidence"?
Uh-oh.

322
00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:54,591
That could be
copyright infringement.

323
00:14:54,592 --> 00:14:56,525
Maybe you should redo the labels.

324
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,529
Like, back to square one.
I'll wait here.

325
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:04,979
Answer your phone.

326
00:15:05,036 --> 00:15:06,335
Davis here.

327
00:15:06,336 --> 00:15:08,637
Davis, get the
squad car over here!

328
00:15:08,673 --> 00:15:12,474
We need some lights and sirens
to spice up this lame-o fight!

329
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:13,742
<i> Fight! Fight! Fight!</i>

330
00:15:13,743 --> 00:15:15,978
What?
I can't hear you

331
00:15:15,979 --> 00:15:17,513
with everyone yelling
"Fight! Fight! Fight!"

332
00:15:17,514 --> 00:15:19,981
There's a fight, in a cage,
in the cornfield!

333
00:15:20,016 --> 00:15:23,552
Understood! Oscar has mice
full of rage on his windshield.

334
00:15:23,554 --> 00:15:28,040
- What?
- Let's go! Angry mice.

335
00:15:29,397 --> 00:15:32,364
You go first.
It's getting hot out here.

336
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,401
No.
You know the saying.

337
00:15:34,402 --> 00:15:36,835
"Punch before slap is total crap.

338
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,737
Slap before punch,
then we get lunch."

339
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:41,908
This isn't a fight.
It's practically a hug.

340
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:45,412
- Somebody needs to fight somebody.
- Is that a challenge?

341
00:15:45,413 --> 00:15:47,113
Fight! Fight! Fight!

342
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:50,916
Huh... bare-knuckle
fighting in a cornfield?

343
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:52,618
Even worse.

344
00:15:53,854 --> 00:15:55,921
Someone's breaking the law.

345
00:15:55,989 --> 00:16:01,125
Lacey! I'm shutting down your
Nigerian email shell game con!

346
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:03,429
- That's not even a thing.
- Hey, Davis,

347
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,197
10 bucks says Brent
falls asleep standing up.

348
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,100
Ooh! I'll take that bet.

349
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:11,019
Oh, sure.
I can't sell 50/50 tickets,

350
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,272
- but you can still gamble?
- Still.

351
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,906
Still!
We left the still unsupervised!

352
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:18,594
- So?
- Whoever owns it could come back

353
00:16:18,595 --> 00:16:20,145
and hide it.
I'm going to go get it.

354
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,814
It won't fit.
The trunk's full of rum.

355
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,249
- So? Unload it.
- You're not going to help me?

356
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,452
Someone has to keep an eye
on that swindler Lacey.

357
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,454
How far away do you think I am?

358
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,657
Ooh-hoo, refreshments.

359
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:35,259
I'll give you 20 bucks for a bottle.

360
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,963
I can't sell you confiscated booze.
That's illegal.

361
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:39,797
Well, it's not like
you're in uniform.

362
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,666
How about you give it to me and I
make donation to the police fund?

363
00:16:43,735 --> 00:16:46,270
- Huh?
- Hm. That does sound less illegal.

364
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:50,008
<i>- I know...
- Pretty good...</i>

365
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,478
I don't think we're the
centre of attention anymore.

366
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:56,313
What say we make this
a little more interesting?

367
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,815
You mean bet on ourselves?

368
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:00,818
- I meant take our pants off.
- Oh.

369
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:01,852
No.

370
00:17:01,853 --> 00:17:04,887
All right, here you go.
Enjoy.

371
00:17:07,158 --> 00:17:09,926
Please don't tell me
you sold all the bootleg rum,

372
00:17:09,961 --> 00:17:13,195
because I'm, like,
60 to 30% sure that's illegal.

373
00:17:13,264 --> 00:17:15,332
Is it illegal if the money buys us

374
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,835
new cotton/bamboo-blend
uniforms? Besides,

375
00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:20,836
everyone loves Sergeant Davis'
Spiced Evidence.

376
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:24,106
They do?
All right!

377
00:17:24,142 --> 00:17:26,842
Oh, that cloud looks like a bunny.

378
00:17:26,877 --> 00:17:29,979
- That one looks like two bunnies.
- Oh yeah!

379
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,514
What are they doing
to each other?

380
00:17:31,515 --> 00:17:34,017
Hey, Nimrods.
Wrap this up!

381
00:17:34,018 --> 00:17:35,317
Even I'm bored now.

382
00:17:35,318 --> 00:17:37,352
Uh, yeah, we're still
fuzzy on the rules.

383
00:17:37,354 --> 00:17:39,488
Okay.
Well, how about this?

384
00:17:39,489 --> 00:17:42,525
Whoever hits the other person first
will get rum and a snack.

385
00:17:42,526 --> 00:17:43,793
If we hit each other
at the same time,

386
00:17:43,794 --> 00:17:46,361
can we both get rum and a snack?

387
00:17:46,396 --> 00:17:49,697
Mm... for a soft guy,
you drive a hard bargain.

388
00:18:02,376 --> 00:18:03,742
<i>The hell?</i>

389
00:18:03,743 --> 00:18:06,278
- It's a draw!
- A draw?

390
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:08,747
- What does that mean?
- No one bet on a draw,

391
00:18:08,748 --> 00:18:10,815
so it means the bookie
keeps the cash.

392
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:13,786
What? This fight was
as much of a shakedown

393
00:18:13,787 --> 00:18:16,889
- as your 50/50 thing!
- Aw, you people suck.

394
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,056
Next round of rum is on me!

395
00:18:19,058 --> 00:18:21,226
<i>- Yeah!
- Oh, sure,</i>

396
00:18:21,227 --> 00:18:23,394
you like ol' Long-Arm
Charlie now, don't ya?

397
00:18:23,396 --> 00:18:25,931
- Karen! Davis!
- Wes' widow.

398
00:18:25,932 --> 00:18:28,699
Someone stole my... art
installation from the woods!

399
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,403
- Can you describe it?
- Well, it's rusty metal,

400
00:18:31,404 --> 00:18:34,739
and it stands on four legs
with a funnel and a spout and...

401
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,208
Does this art installation
in the woods make rum?

402
00:18:38,209 --> 00:18:41,345
Why would an art installation make...
Oh.

403
00:18:41,346 --> 00:18:43,815
Fine.
Yes, I had a rum still.

404
00:18:43,816 --> 00:18:45,849
It was my inheritance
when Wes died.

405
00:18:45,884 --> 00:18:48,084
He said booze
is better than life insurance.

406
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:50,822
- It's fun insurance.
- Well, it's a shame

407
00:18:50,823 --> 00:18:52,956
we'll never find
the dirty handsome punks

408
00:18:53,024 --> 00:18:54,992
who stole it.
Let's go, Karen.

409
00:18:54,993 --> 00:18:58,395
- Wait, what's in your trunk?
- Nothing... dead body.

410
00:18:58,396 --> 00:19:01,265
Really?
What's in the bottles?

411
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:03,900
- Vitamin water.
- In other news,

412
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:06,769
the police fund
had a big year for donations,

413
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:10,273
and we'd like to give you...
this much money!

414
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,908
You raised these funds for me?

415
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:13,742
Hey, I'm the one who
organized the fundraiser,

416
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,311
and we're doing the draw
right now.

417
00:19:15,312 --> 00:19:18,948
- Emma, how much did you raise?
- Let me count.

418
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,049
Nothing.

419
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,418
You didn't sell one ticket?
Why not?

420
00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:24,252
I'm talking hypothetically.

421
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,955
If Oscar died,
would you give me money?

422
00:19:26,991 --> 00:19:29,424
Would how he died
make a difference?

423
00:19:29,493 --> 00:19:32,195
Wood chipper...
brutal and bloody.

424
00:19:32,196 --> 00:19:33,463
How much can I
put you down for?

425
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,798
I don't know.
People are cheap.

426
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,799
Oh, fine,
we'll go with what I sold,

427
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:39,268
and the winning ticket
for the charity draw

428
00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:41,937
- for Wes' widow...
- I have a name, you know.

429
00:19:41,938 --> 00:19:45,773
...is 000 000 003.

430
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:49,244
- Oh! That's me! I won!
- Yay!

431
00:19:49,245 --> 00:19:50,813
I mean, you're the only one
who bought a ticket,

432
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,080
but whoo-hoo!

433
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:54,316
Whatever.
10 bucks is 10 bucks!

434
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:55,317
Yeah, but you're going
to donate your half

435
00:19:55,318 --> 00:19:57,820
to the widow,
what's-her-name.

436
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,987
I mean that's what everybody
does when they win a 50/50.

437
00:19:59,989 --> 00:20:01,156
That defeats the whole purpose.

438
00:20:01,157 --> 00:20:03,090
If I give her my share,
it's a total...

439
00:20:03,126 --> 00:20:06,160
- Oh.
- I told you it was a scam.

440
00:20:06,162 --> 00:20:07,329
You guys are the best.

441
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,498
Yeah. Even Wanda raised money for you.

442
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:13,201
- She did?
- She sure did. Even the cash

443
00:20:13,202 --> 00:20:15,468
she's currently stuffing in her bra.

444
00:20:15,504 --> 00:20:17,437
Anyone want to buy
a fighting cage?

445
00:20:17,472 --> 00:20:20,073
I suppose I could use it
for the chickens.

446
00:20:21,176 --> 00:20:24,311
Yep... we should be safe
from the chickens in here.

447
00:20:24,312 --> 00:20:29,016
- Why do they hate us?
- They hate our freedom.

448
00:20:29,018 --> 00:20:31,485
This is great.
There's enough money here

449
00:20:31,486 --> 00:20:34,921
to replace Wes' rum still
and re-open the insurance agency!

450
00:20:34,989 --> 00:20:37,990
So I'll be able to get a
new life insurance policy

451
00:20:38,026 --> 00:20:41,127
before Oscar dies
a horrible, grisly death.

452
00:20:41,163 --> 00:20:43,829
I'm doing what now?

453
00:20:44,562 --> 00:20:46,429
Yet again,
stealthy Hank-o-potamus

454
00:20:46,464 --> 00:20:50,333
steals the delicious marble
from the ancient Brent-o-saurus.

455
00:20:50,368 --> 00:20:54,670
- So now I'm an old dinosaur?
- I win! Whoo-hoo!

456
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,041
Great. Now we have to
wait for Wanda to...

457
00:21:00,478 --> 00:21:03,233
And that wraps that up.
