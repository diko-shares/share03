for the King of the Castle!

00:00:57.707 --> 00:01:00.281
Not if I get there first!

27
00:01:01.076 --> 00:01:03.176
I'm going to be King!

28
00:01:03.422 --> 00:01:04.570
Whoa!

29
00:01:04.673 --> 00:01:05.692
(groaning)

30
00:01:06.036 --> 00:01:07.294
Guess what?

31
00:01:09.676 --> 00:01:12.301
I'm the Queen of the Castle!

32
00:01:12.325 --> 00:01:13.380
Milady.

33
00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:16.522
(all giggling)

34
00:01:17.128 --> 00:01:19.475
(Princess:) Attention.
Your princess is ready

35
00:01:19.514 --> 00:01:22.483
to show you
the new Throne of Barkingburg.

36
00:01:22.538 --> 00:01:23.538
(giggling)

37
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.218
I decorated it all by myself.

38
00:01:26.317 --> 00:01:27.858
(Earl:)
Magnificent!

39
00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:29.709
Princess, your artistic touch

40
00:01:29.754 --> 00:01:31.850
Shines in every detail.

41
00:01:31.983 --> 00:01:34.624
Why, you've even adorned
the Throne's floor locks!

42
00:01:34.655 --> 00:01:35.686
Thank you.

43
00:01:35.796 --> 00:01:38.874
I've been working for
days to get it all just right.

44
00:01:39.022 --> 00:01:42.350
And one day, you shall
take your place on it as Queen,

45
00:01:42.452 --> 00:01:45.632
and everyone in
Barkingburg will listen to you.

46
00:01:45.843 --> 00:01:48.202
That Throne is
all I've ever wanted!

47
00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:51.647
Especially the part about
having everyone listen to me!

48
00:01:51.772 --> 00:01:54.772
Oh, I just can't stop myself!

49
00:01:54.975 --> 00:01:56.952
(gasping)

50
00:01:57.245 --> 00:01:58.772
Silly Sweetie.

51
00:01:58.944 --> 00:02:01.179
You know you
don't belong up there.

52
00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:03.288
I'm sorry, my princess.

53
00:02:03.444 --> 00:02:05.366
It's so beautiful.

54
00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:07.350
I had to take a closer look.

55
00:02:07.507 --> 00:02:10.452
Can we at least
take a picture of it?

56
00:02:10.617 --> 00:02:12.530
What a lovely idea!

57
00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:14.163
I'll get the camera.

58
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.030
I've already arranged for it.

59
00:02:18.694 --> 00:02:21.679
You are such a thoughtful pup.

60
00:02:23.077 --> 00:02:24.804
There.
I've got the Throne

61
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.264
just the way I want it.

62
00:02:26.352 --> 00:02:27.538
Get ready, Busby.

63
00:02:27.624 --> 00:02:30.952
It's finally time to
put my plan into action.

64
00:02:31.077 --> 00:02:33.389
You may take the picture now.

65
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.621
(camera shutter clicking)

66
00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:35.919
(coughing)

67
00:02:36.024 --> 00:02:37.686
(Earl:)
Dear! What happened?!

68
00:02:37.773 --> 00:02:39.733
(Princess:) Sweetie? Are you all right?
(coughing)

69
00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:40.879
(squeaking)

70
00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:43.782
(beeping)

71
00:02:47.724 --> 00:02:48.888
(coughing)

72
00:02:48.991 --> 00:02:51.052
(Earl:)
I can't see anything!

73
00:02:51.202 --> 00:02:52.208
(squeaking)

74
00:02:52.266 --> 00:02:53.826
(beeping)

75
00:02:55.711 --> 00:02:57.654
We've done it, Busby!

76
00:02:57.917 --> 00:02:59.591
We've got the Royal Throne!

77
00:02:59.845 --> 00:03:03.013
If a pup like me
can't be Queen here,

78
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:06.622
This Throne will
make me Queen somewhere else.

79
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.841
Cheerio, crow!

80
00:03:08.914 --> 00:03:12.274
(crowing)

81
00:03:12.393 --> 00:03:14.983
Hey!
Shoo, shoo!

82
00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:16.577
(screaming)

83
00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:18.261
No!

84
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.092
Now I'll have to find another
way to get my precious Throne

85
00:03:21.136 --> 00:03:22.553
out of Barkingburg.

86
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:23.751
(sighing)

87
00:03:24.108 --> 00:03:26.436
Sweetie!
Where are you?!

88
00:03:26.512 --> 00:03:29.217
My poor,
defenseless poochie is gone!

89
00:03:29.313 --> 00:03:32.030
(gasping)
As well as the Royal Throne!

90
00:03:32.055 --> 00:03:33.056
(gasping)

91
00:03:33.104 --> 00:03:35.639
How can you become
Queen without the Throne?

92
00:03:35.693 --> 00:03:36.951
I can't!

93
00:03:37.021 --> 00:03:39.702
And I so liked the
way I decorated it, too.

94
00:03:39.782 --> 00:03:41.288
For something this important,

95
00:03:41.394 --> 00:03:43.639
There's only
one thing we can do.

96
00:03:43.845 --> 00:03:45.655
Call the Paw Patrol!

97
00:03:45.704 --> 00:03:46.764
(beeping)

98
00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:47.819
Perfect.

99
00:03:47.902 --> 00:03:51.288
Now I know how
I'll move my Throne.

100
00:03:55.338 --> 00:03:56.478
Okay, pups.

101
00:03:56.517 --> 00:04:00.080
Who's ready for some...
(slurping)

102
00:04:00.135 --> 00:04:01.627
(cell phone ringing) (laughing)

103
00:04:01.652 --> 00:04:03.447
Guess you all are.
(cell phone ringing)

104
00:04:03.964 --> 00:04:05.361
The Earl of Barkingburg?

105
00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:07.126
Is everything
okay, your Earlness?

106
00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:08.783
<i>I'm afraid not, Ryder.</i>

107
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:09.908
<i>Someone has taken</i>

108
00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:12.892
<i>the most important
treasure of Barkingburg!</i>

109
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:14.658
<i>The Royal Throne!</i>

110
00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.774
<i>And my precious pup, Sweetie!</i>

111
00:04:16.855 --> 00:04:20.822
<i>If you can't find her,
I shall never smile again.</i>

112
00:04:21.015 --> 00:04:23.111
Don't worry!
We're on our way.

113
00:04:23.184 --> 00:04:25.744
No job is too big,
no pup is too small.

114
00:04:25.824 --> 00:04:26.954
Paw Patrol,

115
00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:28.791
to the Air Patroller!

116
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.994
(All:)
Ryder needs us!

117
00:04:31.096 --> 00:04:32.822
Wait for me!

118
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.072
Whoa!

119
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.588
Hey, this is fun!

120
00:04:37.816 --> 00:04:39.838
Whoo-hoo!

121
00:04:40.767 --> 00:04:43.533
(All:)
Marshall, slow down!

122
00:04:43.775 --> 00:04:45.435
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!

123
00:04:45.504 --> 00:04:46.520
(crashing)

124
00:04:47.544 --> 00:04:50.163
Now I'm King of the Castle!

125
00:04:50.234 --> 00:04:51.936
( all laugh)

126
00:04:56.855 --> 00:05:00.808
Paw Patrol, ready
for action, Ryder, sir.

127
00:05:00.894 --> 00:05:04.222
Jolly good pups because
we're heading to Barkingburg.

128
00:05:04.433 --> 00:05:07.714
Someone took the Royal
Throne and the Royal pup.

129
00:05:07.739 --> 00:05:08.745
(gasping)

130
00:05:08.815 --> 00:05:10.097
An extraordinary mission

131
00:05:10.183 --> 00:05:12.659
like this calls
for extraordinary gear.

132
00:05:12.713 --> 00:05:14.675
(beeping)
Sounds like this is a...

133
00:05:14.776 --> 00:05:16.425
(All:) Mission Paw!

134
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.800
Robo-dog,
put us in stealth mode.

135
00:05:19.901 --> 00:05:21.972
(barking)
(all cheering)

136
00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:25.388
(whirring)

137
00:05:43.194 --> 00:05:44.288
Whoo!

138
00:05:44.366 --> 00:05:47.210
This way to gear
up, Mission Paw style!

139
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.608
(cheering)
(barking)

140
00:05:50.467 --> 00:05:52.139
(giggling)

141
00:05:57.592 --> 00:06:00.774
(giggling)
(snorting)

142
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.438
Okay, pups.

143
00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:08.305
Our Mission Paw is
to find the missing Throne

144
00:06:08.422 --> 00:06:09.938
And the princess' pup.

145
00:06:10.016 --> 00:06:12.313
Sweetie's
always up to something.

146
00:06:12.477 --> 00:06:15.375
I bet if we find her,
we find the Throne, too.

147
00:06:15.524 --> 00:06:17.477
We won't know
until we start looking.

148
00:06:17.625 --> 00:06:20.406
So, for this
Mission Paw, I'll need Rocky.

149
00:06:20.492 --> 00:06:22.250
You'll use your radar scanner

150
00:06:22.321 --> 00:06:24.375
to look for any
clues in the Throne room.

151
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.469
Green means go!

152
00:06:26.664 --> 00:06:30.227
Skye, use your sky cycle
to scout the Castle from above.

153
00:06:30.391 --> 00:06:32.805
This puppy's gotta fly!

154
00:06:32.977 --> 00:06:35.649

Captain Busby,

176
00:07:26.918 --> 00:07:28.340
Prepare for take-off.

(beeping)

178

Paw Patrol!

179
00:07:32.379 --> 00:07:33.614
Thank goodness you're here

180
00:07:33.676 --> 00:07:37.082
to find my Throne
and my missing Sweetie.

181
00:07:37.192 --> 00:07:40.489
Rocky, head inside and see what
you can find in the Throne room.

182
00:07:40.598 --> 00:07:41.754
On it!
(barking)

183
00:07:41.856 --> 00:07:42.965
Radar scanner.

184
00:07:43.043 --> 00:07:45.684
(whirring)

185
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.953
Nothing suspicious yet.

186
00:07:55.781 --> 00:07:56.875
Hey!

187
00:07:56.914 --> 00:07:59.211
I found a secret
panel in the ceiling!

188
00:07:59.313 --> 00:08:01.469
Maybe the Throne
thief snuck out that way!

189
00:08:01.554 --> 00:08:02.797
Thanks, Rocky!

190
00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:04.867
Skye, time for aerial recon.

191
00:08:04.992 --> 00:08:06.297
Start with the Castle roof.

192
00:08:06.406 --> 00:08:09.383
<i>This pup's going up!</i>

193
00:08:11.656 --> 00:08:12.701
(beeping)

194
00:08:12.756 --> 00:08:13.992
That's strange.

195
00:08:14.046 --> 00:08:17.305
My pup pad's telling me the
Air Patroller just took off.

196
00:08:17.484 --> 00:08:19.125
But who's flying it?

197
00:08:19.477 --> 00:08:21.969
I see the Throne!
It's on the roof!

198
00:08:22.094 --> 00:08:24.013
But no sign of Sweetie.

199
00:08:24.232 --> 00:08:25.530
Huh?!

200
00:08:25.944 --> 00:08:27.778
What's the
Air Patroller doing here?

201
00:08:27.872 --> 00:08:30.318
Whoa!

202
00:08:32.444 --> 00:08:35.561
Ryder, the Air Patroller
took the Throne!

203
00:08:35.662 --> 00:08:38.334
Stay on its tail until
we figure out what's going on!

204
00:08:38.467 --> 00:08:40.256
Roger that!

205
00:08:42.193 --> 00:08:43.986
(giggling)
(snorting)

206
00:08:44.131 --> 00:08:46.695
Ryder!
The thief is Sweetie!

207
00:08:46.765 --> 00:08:51.523
Ahem, that's Queen
Sweetie because I now have

208
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:53.593
The Throne of Barkingburg,

209
00:08:53.718 --> 00:08:55.617
And my autopilot, Busby,

210
00:08:55.734 --> 00:08:58.695
is going to fly me
to my very own kingdom.

211
00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:01.304
<i>I'll be the
Queen of wherever I land.</i>

212
00:09:01.382 --> 00:09:02.499
<i>(giggling)</i>

213
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.101
That pup!

214
00:09:04.202 --> 00:09:06.734
Someone's not getting
her belly rubbed tonight.

215
00:09:06.851 --> 00:09:09.351
Mission Paw is
on your tail, Sweetie!

216
00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.609
Skye, stay with
the Air Patroller!

217
00:09:11.687 --> 00:09:13.023
(Skye:)
Trying my best,

218
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.023
But it's super fast.

219
00:09:15.148 --> 00:09:17.952
Robo-dog, don't let
it out of your sight.

220
00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.343
(barking)

221
00:09:19.413 --> 00:09:20.445
(tires squealing)

222
00:09:20.491 --> 00:09:23.544
(engine roaring)

223
00:09:27.478 --> 00:09:29.705
(beeping)

224
00:09:29.783 --> 00:09:30.803
(gasping)

225
00:09:30.923 --> 00:09:32.228
She's behind us!

226
00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:33.431
Captain Busby!

227
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:37.931
Let's lose that
Canine and her copter!

228
00:09:40.189 --> 00:09:42.329
Whoa, whoa!

229
00:09:42.511 --> 00:09:43.837
Whoa!

230
00:09:43.978 --> 00:09:45.189
Whew.

231
00:09:47.306 --> 00:09:48.509
Are you okay, Skye?

232
00:09:48.587 --> 00:09:50.572
<i>Yeah, but that was a close one.</i>

233
00:09:50.626 --> 00:09:52.423
Did you see which
direction she went?

234
00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.408
<i>It looks like
she headed southwest.</i>

235
00:09:57.095 --> 00:09:59.626
If she's going that way...

236
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.587
She's taking the
Air Patroller to the jungle!

237
00:10:02.743 --> 00:10:04.009
Hit it, Robo-dog!

238
00:10:04.118 --> 00:10:05.712
(barking)

239
00:10:13.013 --> 00:10:16.224
I don't have a shovel,
Carlos, but I'll help you dig.

240
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:20.365
Tracker, you could
be an archaeologist pup!

241
00:10:20.506 --> 00:10:21.540
(beeping)

242
00:10:21.599 --> 00:10:24.021
I hear something.

243
00:10:24.714 --> 00:10:28.631
I don't hear any...
(engine whirring)

244
00:10:28.834 --> 00:10:30.545
Airplane, wow!

245
00:10:30.693 --> 00:10:32.638
Tracker, great ears!

246
00:10:32.717 --> 00:10:34.873
Isn't that the Air Patroller?

247
00:10:35.037 --> 00:10:38.029
Yeah, that's the
Paw badge on the back!

248
00:10:38.622 --> 00:10:39.661
Cool!

249
00:10:39.717 --> 00:10:42.287
It sounds like
they're landing Alli.

250
00:10:42.396 --> 00:10:44.084
Vamos!

251
00:10:46.724 --> 00:10:49.737
(monkeys chattering)

252
00:10:51.868 --> 00:10:54.571
Greetings, loyal subjects.

253
00:10:54.728 --> 00:10:58.642
I am Queen Sweetie,
your new ruler!

254
00:10:58.775 --> 00:10:59.798
(grunting)

255
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:01.230
As your Queen,

256
00:11:01.275 --> 00:11:04.728
I command you to give me
all of your precious gems.

257
00:11:04.946 --> 00:11:06.228
(grunting)

258
00:11:07.017 --> 00:11:09.486
Okay, I'll take bananas.

259
00:11:09.962 --> 00:11:13.165
Queen Sweetie deserves
the greatest banana collection

260
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:14.294
in the world!

261
00:11:14.376 --> 00:11:16.056
(chattering)

262
00:11:17.196 --> 00:11:18.713
(Tracker:)
That's not Ryder

263
00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:20.595
Or any of our Amigos.

264
00:11:20.759 --> 00:11:23.657
(Carlos:) But that's definitely
the Air Patroller.

265
00:11:23.767 --> 00:11:25.712
Something's going on.

266
00:11:26.095 --> 00:11:27.657
I better pup tag Ryder.

267
00:11:27.814 --> 00:11:29.219
Ryder!

268
00:11:29.329 --> 00:11:31.282
<i>Soy yo tracker, where are you?</i>

269
00:11:31.307 --> 00:11:33.978
We're just
heading into the jungle.

270
00:11:34.157 --> 00:11:35.415
<i>Well, your Air Patroller's</i>

271
00:11:35.478 --> 00:11:37.595
<i>already here
at the monkey temple.</i>

272
00:11:37.682 --> 00:11:39.111
<i>With a pup we don't know!</i>

273
00:11:39.228 --> 00:11:40.376
Thanks for the tip.

274
00:11:40.446 --> 00:11:43.564
Please keep an eye on her, and
let us know what she's up to.

275
00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:46.798
We'll be there soon!

276
00:11:48.568 --> 00:11:50.339
(stomach rumbling)

277
00:11:50.428 --> 00:11:52.029
Yuck!

278
00:11:52.255 --> 00:11:55.240
I guess I don't
really like bananas,

279
00:11:55.313 --> 00:11:58.537
But I do like having all of them

280
00:11:58.709 --> 00:12:01.108
Because I'm
Queen of the monkeys!

281
00:12:01.219 --> 00:12:03.873
Now, carry me into the temple!

282
00:12:03.952 --> 00:12:07.404
(monkeys chattering)

283
00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.467
(grunting)

284
00:12:09.717 --> 00:12:11.373
(chattering)

285
00:12:11.639 --> 00:12:14.717
What do you mean
you're the monkey Queen?!

286
00:12:14.835 --> 00:12:16.335
You may have the crown,

287
00:12:16.671 --> 00:12:18.662
But I have the Throne!

288
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:23.115
Now, move your
Sweetie into a new Castle.

289
00:12:23.261 --> 00:12:25.195
(chattering)

290
00:12:26.459 --> 00:12:28.107
(grunting)

291
00:12:28.308 --> 00:12:29.756
Oyoyoy!

292
00:12:29.867 --> 00:12:30.967
Los monos!

293
00:12:31.044 --> 00:12:32.537
They're taking sides!

294
00:12:32.635 --> 00:12:34.326
Monkey minions!

295
00:12:34.359 --> 00:12:35.626
Push harder!

296
00:12:35.736 --> 00:12:38.138
(angry chattering)

297
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:41.888
(brakes screeching)

298
00:12:42.615 --> 00:12:45.701
(chattering)

299
00:12:46.248 --> 00:12:48.161
(cheering)

300
00:12:49.821 --> 00:12:52.209
(gasping)

301
00:12:53.464 --> 00:12:54.584
(chattering)

302
00:12:54.618 --> 00:12:55.952
(Tracker:)
Monkeys, cuidado!

303
00:12:56.318 --> 00:12:57.717
Get away from those statues!

304
00:12:57.819 --> 00:13:00.686
Ryder, we have
to stop those statues

305
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.084
from falling on the monkeys!

306
00:13:02.131 --> 00:13:03.155
(gasping)
We're on!

307
00:13:03.187 --> 00:13:04.256
The Paw Patrol?

308
00:13:04.319 --> 00:13:06.334
Time to abandon kingdom.

309
00:13:06.437 --> 00:13:09.248
Monkey subjects,
to the Air Patroller!

310
00:13:09.434 --> 00:13:10.760
Okay, tracker.

311
00:13:10.898 --> 00:13:12.635
Use your cables
to fly Chase's winch

312
00:13:12.677 --> 00:13:14.862
up to the top of that palm tree!

313
00:13:14.909 --> 00:13:16.932
Let's go, tracker!

314
00:13:17.143 --> 00:13:18.188
(barking)

315
00:13:18.268 --> 00:13:19.690
Cables!

316
00:13:21.853 --> 00:13:25.065
(barking)
Winch!

317
00:13:32.242 --> 00:13:33.383
It's ready!

318
00:13:33.491 --> 00:13:35.790
Winch, retract!

319
00:13:40.304 --> 00:13:41.434
(cheering, giggling)

320
00:13:41.478 --> 00:13:43.039
Thanks, Ryder.

321
00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.017
Hey, guys?

322
00:13:45.331 --> 00:13:47.876
Sweetie's getting away!
(gasping)

323
00:13:48.446 --> 00:13:50.767
(grunting)

324
00:13:51.118 --> 00:13:54.072
Wow, I haven't
even tripped once!

325
00:13:55.036 --> 00:13:56.216
Whoa!

326
00:13:56.256 --> 00:13:57.456
(crashing)

327
00:13:58.005 --> 00:13:59.959
I'm good!

328
00:14:01.669 --> 00:14:04.239
That sneaky
Sweetie got away again!

329
00:14:04.542 --> 00:14:05.700
Sorry, Ryder.

330
00:14:05.754 --> 00:14:06.919
It's okay, Marshall.

331
00:14:06.982 --> 00:14:08.382
We'll catch her next time.

332
00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:09.700
Let's ride!

333
00:14:10.001 --> 00:14:11.504
Good luck, Paw Patrol!

334
00:14:11.575 --> 00:14:14.356
(Tracker:)
<i>Buena Suerte, Amigos!</i>

335
00:14:15.199 --> 00:14:16.379
(pup pad ringing)

336
00:14:17.106 --> 00:14:19.734
<i>Ryder, have you
found my Throne yet?</i>

337
00:14:19.911 --> 00:14:22.333
We did, but
Sweetie got away again.

338
00:14:22.439 --> 00:14:23.794
<i>Oh, that pup.</i>

339
00:14:23.903 --> 00:14:26.200
<i>No more handbag
of treats for her.</i>

340
00:14:26.296 --> 00:14:28.278
Don't worry.
We're still on her trail.

341
00:14:28.411 --> 00:14:30.340
I saw her flying
the Air Patroller south,

342
00:14:30.426 --> 00:14:32.997
And there's only one
thing in that direction.

343
00:14:39.457 --> 00:14:41.270
Greetings, loyal subjects.

344
00:14:41.431 --> 00:14:43.543
I'm Queen... whoa!

345
00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.840
(crashing)

346
00:14:45.638 --> 00:14:47.098
(giggling)

347
00:14:47.325 --> 00:14:48.840
(grunting)

348
00:14:50.647 --> 00:14:51.676
Yuck!

349
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.746
I can't stand fish!

350
00:14:53.864 --> 00:14:59.278
My first Royal rule
is never give your ruler fish.

351
00:14:59.739 --> 00:15:02.739
(squawking) And now, for
my first Royal command.

352
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.129
Build your beloved
Queen an ice Castle!

353
00:15:06.355 --> 00:15:09.082
The most magnificent
Castle ever seen

354
00:15:09.129 --> 00:15:10.153
in...

355
00:15:10.637 --> 00:15:14.239
(gasping)
the south Sweetie pole!

356
00:15:17.967 --> 00:15:19.248
(engine stopping)

357
00:15:19.974 --> 00:15:22.326
This looks a little
too flat for snowboarding.

358
00:15:22.428 --> 00:15:25.809
Yeah, but it's
great for penguin watching!

359
00:15:26.474 --> 00:15:27.835
It looks like
there's a whole bunch

360
00:15:27.865 --> 00:15:29.826
of our flipper-y
friends over there!

361
00:15:29.851 --> 00:15:30.856
Oh, yeah!

362
00:15:30.881 --> 00:15:32.974
Over there,
by the Air Patroller!

363
00:15:33.253 --> 00:15:34.522
(Both:)
Air Patroller?!

364
00:15:34.766 --> 00:15:36.849
But where's Ryder
and the Paw Patrol?

365
00:15:36.935 --> 00:15:39.987
And look at those penguins
pushing ice around that pup!

366
00:15:40.162 --> 00:15:41.974
I'll pup tag
Ryder and see what's up.

367
00:15:42.028 --> 00:15:44.170
And I'll go say
hi to our new friend!

368
00:15:44.278 --> 00:15:46.838
(giggling)
Whoo-hoo!

369
00:15:48.586 --> 00:15:51.500
Oh, oh, oh!
Don't forget the drawbridge!

370
00:15:51.669 --> 00:15:53.719
Howdy.
Name's Jake.

371
00:15:53.797 --> 00:15:56.047
So, uh, where's Ryder?

372
00:15:56.203 --> 00:15:59.586
Oh, uh, he
let me have his plane.

373
00:15:59.664 --> 00:16:00.687
It's okay.

374
00:16:00.758 --> 00:16:01.828
I'm a Queen.

375
00:16:01.853 --> 00:16:02.883
See?

376
00:16:02.921 --> 00:16:05.078
This is my Royal ice Castle.

377
00:16:05.289 --> 00:16:09.000
And I command you, tall
person, to help finish it.

378
00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.080
(chuckling)

379
00:16:10.109 --> 00:16:11.891
You're a funny pup.

380
00:16:12.266 --> 00:16:14.750
Go on.
The work won't finish itself.

381
00:16:14.892 --> 00:16:16.078
Uh, okay.

382
00:16:16.151 --> 00:16:17.898
Always glad to help.

383
00:16:19.008 --> 00:16:21.945
So that's what the
Air Patroller is doing here.

384
00:16:22.063 --> 00:16:23.476
That pup took it!

385
00:16:23.585 --> 00:16:25.601
Along with the Throne of Barkingburg!
(gasping)

386
00:16:25.665 --> 00:16:27.875
She wants to use it
to set up her own kingdom.

387
00:16:28.086 --> 00:16:29.328
Can you help us get it back?

388
00:16:29.453 --> 00:16:31.820
Ice or snow, I'm ready to go!

389
00:16:31.905 --> 00:16:33.539
Great!
We're on our way.

390
00:16:33.711 --> 00:16:36.039
Just don't let Sweetie
take off until we get there.

391
00:16:36.226 --> 00:16:37.586
Jake and I won't let you down!

392
00:16:37.617 --> 00:16:38.636
(beeping)

393
00:16:38.723 --> 00:16:40.101
Rocky, it's time for you

394
00:16:40.141 --> 00:16:42.539
to do some
extraordinary gadget making.

395
00:16:42.609 --> 00:16:45.359
We need a device that will take
control of the Air Patroller.

396
00:16:45.516 --> 00:16:48.930
Wow, good thing we travel
with a lot of spare parts!

397
00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.398
'cause I don't
lose it, I reuse it!

398
00:16:58.064 --> 00:16:59.423
Bigger!
Bigger!

399
00:16:59.509 --> 00:17:03.710
I want the biggest, most
magnificent ice Castle ever!

400
00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:05.720
Oh, hi, Everest!

401
00:17:05.789 --> 00:17:07.589
Wanna help us
make an ice Castle?

402
00:17:07.614 --> 00:17:08.637
(chuckling)

403
00:17:08.719 --> 00:17:11.274
(whispering:) I'm playing
along so I can figure out

404
00:17:11.342 --> 00:17:12.493
What she's up to!

405
00:17:12.587 --> 00:17:14.001
She's up to no good.

406
00:17:14.173 --> 00:17:17.892
Jake, that pup took the
Air Patroller and that Throne.

407
00:17:18.001 --> 00:17:20.884
We've got to stall her
till the Paw Patrol gets here!

408
00:17:20.953 --> 00:17:22.095
Hello!

409
00:17:22.134 --> 00:17:24.938
There are no breaks
in the South Sweetie Pole.

410
00:17:25.017 --> 00:17:26.134
Okey dokey, Sweetie.

411
00:17:26.182 --> 00:17:30.228
Queen Sweetie, or
your most gracious Majesty.

412
00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.040
Let's push this ice
chunk so it blocks her in!

413
00:17:33.106 --> 00:17:34.368
Good plan!

414
00:17:34.639 --> 00:17:36.636
Lend a flipper, penguins!

415
00:17:36.703 --> 00:17:39.603
(grunting)

416
00:17:39.816 --> 00:17:41.667
Hey, I can't get out!

417
00:17:41.808 --> 00:17:44.566
I command you to
build a Castle back door!

418
00:17:44.698 --> 00:17:46.292
Sorry, meanie Queenie,

419
00:17:46.362 --> 00:17:49.183
You're staying there
till the Paw Patrol gets here!

420
00:17:49.278 --> 00:17:51.253
I don't think so.

421
00:17:51.515 --> 00:17:52.581
(barking)

422
00:17:52.644 --> 00:17:53.720
Claw!

423
00:17:53.745 --> 00:17:57.144
Fresh fish to the first
penguin who builds a staircase

424
00:17:57.212 --> 00:18:00.003
That helps your Queen get out!

425
00:18:04.247 --> 00:18:05.324
Whoa!

426
00:18:05.462 --> 00:18:06.769
She played the fish card!

427
00:18:06.811 --> 00:18:07.977
(crashing)
Uh-oh!

428
00:18:08.088 --> 00:18:11.207
That Castle is
getting too heavy for this ice!

429
00:18:11.334 --> 00:18:14.379
Penguins, no!
The ice is going to break!

430
00:18:14.477 --> 00:18:17.445
Get away from that Castle!

431
00:18:17.596 --> 00:18:18.796
Whoa!

432
00:18:18.954 --> 00:18:21.588
Penguins
should not build Castles!

433
00:18:21.883 --> 00:18:23.182
(grunting)

434
00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:24.547
Come on, little fella!

435
00:18:24.608 --> 00:18:25.616
I'll save you!

436
00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:26.717
(gasping)

437
00:18:26.742 --> 00:18:27.826
Whoa!

438
00:18:28.048 --> 00:18:30.022
(gasping)
My Throne!

439
00:18:30.202 --> 00:18:32.452
I'll get it back
with the Air Patroller!

440
00:18:32.639 --> 00:18:36.108
Jake, penguins can
swim in freezing cold water!

441
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.584
You can't!

442
00:18:37.723 --> 00:18:38.723
Oh, yeah!

443
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:40.038
Whoa!

444
00:18:40.473 --> 00:18:42.022
That was close!

445
00:18:42.123 --> 00:18:43.256
I'll get you!

446
00:18:43.281 --> 00:18:44.333
Everest!

447
00:18:44.358 --> 00:18:46.983
You've got to stop
Sweetie before she takes off!

448
00:18:47.077 --> 00:18:48.959
I'm okay.
You can get me later!

449
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.405
(barking)
Snowboard!

450
00:19:07.039 --> 00:19:08.326
Sorry, Ryder.

451
00:19:08.432 --> 00:19:10.391
We stalled her
as long as we could.

452
00:19:10.471 --> 00:19:12.068
It was a good try, Everest.

453
00:19:12.235 --> 00:19:14.547
And look, she left the Throne!

454
00:19:14.618 --> 00:19:15.735
Yeah!

455
00:19:15.845 --> 00:19:17.685
It's getting
a little small here.

456
00:19:17.914 --> 00:19:20.649
Zuma, use your
mini-sub to rescue Jake!

457
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:23.297
Let's dive in!

458
00:19:29.854 --> 00:19:32.205
(barking)
Scuba!

459
00:19:35.003 --> 00:19:38.641
Hang in there, Jake!

460
00:19:39.594 --> 00:19:41.194
(grunting)

461
00:19:42.044 --> 00:19:43.450
Oh, thanks!

462
00:19:43.575 --> 00:19:47.325
Kinda like water-skiing
but a whole lot chillier.

463
00:19:47.462 --> 00:19:49.700
(cheering)
Way to go!

464
00:19:51.142 --> 00:19:53.042
(whirring)

465
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:54.371
(gasping)

466
00:19:54.425 --> 00:19:56.667
Sweetie's going to
grab the Throne back!

467
00:19:56.769 --> 00:19:58.964
And take that
poor penguin with it!

468
00:19:59.089 --> 00:20:02.457
Everest, use your
snowboard to save that bird!

469
00:20:02.483 --> 00:20:05.623
Surf's up!

470
00:20:08.195 --> 00:20:11.568
Hurry, penguin! Come on!

471
00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:14.487
At least that little penguin

472
00:20:14.565 --> 00:20:16.534
won't be taking
a trip with Sweetie!

473
00:20:16.667 --> 00:20:20.807
Yeah, but that no-good pup
is getting away with the Throne!

474
00:20:20.962 --> 00:20:22.073
Not for long.

475
00:20:22.173 --> 00:20:24.245
Is your plane
controller ready, Rocky?

476
00:20:24.375 --> 00:20:26.042
Yup, it's ready!

477
00:20:26.174 --> 00:20:29.253
Marshall, use your hydro
launcher to blast Rocky's gadget

478
00:20:29.307 --> 00:20:30.576
onto the Air Patroller!

479
00:20:30.659 --> 00:20:33.821
(barking)
Hydro launcher!

480
00:20:35.654 --> 00:20:38.130
Your serve, Marshall!

481
00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.162
Nice shot, pups!

482
00:20:44.209 --> 00:20:47.030
Rocky, get control of
our plane and bring it back!

483
00:20:47.198 --> 00:20:49.436
Roger that, Ryder!

484
00:20:52.936 --> 00:20:54.201
It's working!

485
00:20:54.351 --> 00:20:55.694
Captain Busby!

486
00:20:55.799 --> 00:20:57.483
You're flying the wrong way!

487
00:20:57.662 --> 00:20:59.459
(powering down)
(squeaking)

488
00:20:59.584 --> 00:21:01.756
The Paw Patrol
must have done something!

489
00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.780
Fine!
I'll fly this thing myself.

490
00:21:05.124 --> 00:21:06.905
Whoa!

491
00:21:07.098 --> 00:21:08.795
<i>I'm afraid not, Sweetie.</i>

492
00:21:08.912 --> 00:21:12.225
<i>Mission Paw is controlling
the Air Patroller now!</i>

493
00:21:15.342 --> 00:21:18.389
Okay, okay!
I give up!

494
00:21:18.499 --> 00:21:21.639
Just stop this awful ride!

495
00:21:24.561 --> 00:21:27.421
Think we're ready
to head back to Barkingburg!

496
00:21:30.184 --> 00:21:32.137
Still no sign of the Paw Patrol

497
00:21:32.311 --> 00:21:34.458
or my beautiful Throne.

498
00:21:34.823 --> 00:21:37.668
(whirring)

499
00:21:37.844 --> 00:21:39.184
It's the Air Patroller!

500
00:21:39.319 --> 00:21:41.333
(gasping)
With my Throne!

501
00:21:41.731 --> 00:21:44.504
And here comes
the Mission Cruiser!

502
00:21:44.781 --> 00:21:47.281
(brakes screeching)

503
00:21:47.347 --> 00:21:50.957
Okay, Rocky.
Bring her in for a landing!

504
00:21:53.958 --> 00:21:55.392
Wha... whoa!

505
00:21:55.654 --> 00:21:59.136
Oops, I didn't mean to do that!

506
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:06.471
Greetings, loyal subjects.

507
00:22:06.634 --> 00:22:08.936
I am Queen...

508
00:22:09.093 --> 00:22:11.400
(splashing)

509
00:22:13.204 --> 00:22:16.385
I really can't stand fish.

510
00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.596
My poor soggy Sweetie!

511
00:22:18.686 --> 00:22:20.174
Come here.

512
00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:25.189
(Earl:) Now, that's a Royal
smile, your highness.

513
00:22:25.283 --> 00:22:27.744
Thank you, pups,
for saving the Royal Throne

514
00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.963
and giving the princess
a reason to smile again!

515
00:22:31.101 --> 00:22:32.752
No problem, your Earlness.

516
00:22:32.916 --> 00:22:34.713
Whenever you
have a Royal problem,

517
00:22:34.827 --> 00:22:37.057
Just say "Cheese" for help!

518
00:22:37.274 --> 00:22:40.534
(giggling)
Except for my naughty Sweetie!

519
00:22:40.635 --> 00:22:42.807
She says, "I'm sorry!"

520
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:44.213
(All:)
Cheese!

521
00:22:44.315 --> 00:22:45.892
I'm sorry!

522
00:22:45.947 --> 00:22:47.713
Sorta.
