00:00:55.391 --> 00:00:57.578
for the King of the Castle!

26
00:00:57.707 --> 00:01:00.281
Not if I get there first!

27
00:01:01.076 --> 00:01:03.176
I'm going to be King!

28
00:01:03.422 --> 00:01:04.570
Whoa!

29
00:01:06.036 --> 00:01:07.294
Guess what?

30
00:01:09.676 --> 00:01:12.301
I'm the Queen of the Castle!

31
00:01:12.325 --> 00:01:13.380
Milady.

32
00:01:17.128 --> 00:01:19.475
Attention.
Your princess is ready

33
00:01:19.514 --> 00:01:22.483
to show you
the new Throne of Barkingburg.

34
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.218
I decorated it all by myself.

35
00:01:26.317 --> 00:01:27.858
Magnificent!

36
00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:29.709
Princess, your artistic touch

37
00:01:29.754 --> 00:01:31.850
Shines in every detail.

38
00:01:31.983 --> 00:01:34.624
Why, you've even adorned
the Throne's floor locks!

39
00:01:34.655 --> 00:01:35.686
Thank you.

40
00:01:35.796 --> 00:01:38.874
I've been working for
days to get it all just right.

41
00:01:39.022 --> 00:01:42.350
And one day, you shall
take your place on it as Queen,

42
00:01:42.452 --> 00:01:45.632
and everyone in
Barkingburg will listen to you.

43
00:01:45.843 --> 00:01:48.202
That Throne is
all I've ever wanted!

44
00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:51.647
Especially the part about
having everyone listen to me!

45
00:01:51.772 --> 00:01:54.772
Oh, I just can't stop myself!

46
00:01:57.245 --> 00:01:58.772
Silly Sweetie.

47
00:01:58.944 --> 00:02:01.179
You know you
don't belong up there.

48
00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:03.288
I'm sorry, my princess.

49
00:02:03.444 --> 00:02:05.366
It's so beautiful.

50
00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:07.350
I had to take a closer look.

51
00:02:07.507 --> 00:02:10.452
Can we at least
take a picture of it?

52
00:02:10.617 --> 00:02:12.530
What a lovely idea!

53
00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:14.163
I'll get the camera.

54
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.030
I've already arranged for it.

55
00:02:18.694 --> 00:02:21.679
You are such a thoughtful pup.

56
00:02:23.077 --> 00:02:24.804
There.
I've got the Throne

57
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.264
just the way I want it.

58
00:02:26.352 --> 00:02:27.538
Get ready, Busby.

59
00:02:27.624 --> 00:02:30.952
It's finally time to
put my plan into action.

60
00:02:31.077 --> 00:02:33.389
You may take the picture now.

61
00:02:36.024 --> 00:02:37.686
Dear! What happened?!

62
00:02:37.773 --> 00:02:39.733
Sweetie? Are you all right?

63
00:02:48.991 --> 00:02:51.052
I can't see anything!

64
00:02:55.711 --> 00:02:57.654
We've done it, Busby!

65
00:02:57.917 --> 00:02:59.591
We've got the Royal Throne!

66
00:02:59.845 --> 00:03:03.013
If a pup like me
can't be Queen here,

67
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:06.622
This Throne will
make me Queen somewhere else.

68
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.841
Cheerio, crow!

69
00:03:12.393 --> 00:03:14.983
Hey!
Shoo, shoo!

70
00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:18.261
No!

71
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.092
Now I'll have to find another
way to get my precious Throne

72
00:03:21.136 --> 00:03:22.553
out of Barkingburg.

73
00:03:24.108 --> 00:03:26.436
Sweetie!
Where are you?!

74
00:03:26.512 --> 00:03:29.406
My poor,
defenseless poochie is gone!

75
00:03:30.016 --> 00:03:32.030
As well as the Royal Throne!

76
00:03:33.104 --> 00:03:35.639
How can you become
Queen without the Throne?

77
00:03:35.693 --> 00:03:36.951
I can't!

78
00:03:37.021 --> 00:03:39.702
And I so liked the
way I decorated it, too.

79
00:03:39.782 --> 00:03:41.288
For something this important,

80
00:03:41.394 --> 00:03:43.639
There's only
one thing we can do.

81
00:03:43.845 --> 00:03:45.655
Call the Paw Patrol!

82
00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:47.819
Perfect.

83
00:03:47.902 --> 00:03:51.288
Now I know how
I'll move my Throne.

84
00:03:55.338 --> 00:03:56.478
Okay, pups.

85
00:03:56.517 --> 00:04:00.080
Who's ready for some...

86
00:04:01.652 --> 00:04:03.237
Guess you all are.

87
00:04:03.964 --> 00:04:05.361
The Earl of Barkingburg?

88
00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:07.126
Is everything
okay, your Earlness?

89
00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:08.783
<i>I'm afraid not, Ryder.</i>

90
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:09.908
<i>Someone has taken</i>

91
00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:12.892
<i>the most important
treasure of Barkingburg!</i>

92
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:14.658
<i>The Royal Throne!</i>

93
00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.774
<i>And my precious pup, Sweetie!</i>

94
00:04:16.855 --> 00:04:20.822
<i>If you can't find her,
I shall never smile again.</i>

95
00:04:21.015 --> 00:04:23.111
Don't worry!
We're on our way.

96
00:04:23.184 --> 00:04:25.744
No job is too big,
no pup is too small.

97
00:04:25.824 --> 00:04:26.954
Paw Patrol,

98
00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:28.791
to the Air Patroller!

99
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.994
Ryder needs us!

100
00:04:31.096 --> 00:04:32.822
Wait for me!

101
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.072
Whoa!

102
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.588
Hey, this is fun!

103
00:04:37.816 --> 00:04:39.838
Whoo-hoo!

104
00:04:40.767 --> 00:04:43.533
Marshall, slow down!

105
00:04:43.775 --> 00:04:45.435
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!

106
00:04:47.544 --> 00:04:50.163
Now I'm King of the Castle!

107
00:04:56.855 --> 00:05:00.808
Paw Patrol, ready
for action, Ryder, sir.

108
00:05:00.894 --> 00:05:04.222
Jolly good pups because
we're heading to Barkingburg.

109
00:05:04.433 --> 00:05:07.714
Someone took the Royal
Throne and the Royal pup.

110
00:05:08.815 --> 00:05:10.097
An extraordinary mission

111
00:05:10.183 --> 00:05:12.659
like this calls
for extraordinary gear.

112
00:05:12.713 --> 00:05:14.675
Sounds like this is a...

113
00:05:14.776 --> 00:05:16.425
Mission Paw!

114
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.800
Robo-dog,
put us in stealth mode.

115
00:05:43.194 --> 00:05:44.288
Whoo!

116
00:05:44.366 --> 00:05:47.210
This way to gear
up, Mission Paw style!

117
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.438
Okay, pups.

118
00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:08.305
Our Mission Paw is
to find the missing Throne

119
00:06:08.422 --> 00:06:09.938
And the princess' pup.

120
00:06:10.016 --> 00:06:12.313
Sweetie's
always up to something.

121
00:06:12.477 --> 00:06:15.375
I bet if we find her,
we find the Throne, too.

122
00:06:15.524 --> 00:06:17.477
We won't know
until we start looking.

123
00:06:17.625 --> 00:06:20.406
So, for this
Mission Paw, I'll need Rocky.

124
00:06:20.492 --> 00:06:22.250
You'll use your radar scanner

125
00:06:22.321 --> 00:06:24.375
to look for any
clues in the Throne room.

126
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.469
Green means go!

127
00:06:26.664 --> 00:06:30.227
Skye, use your sky cycle
to scout the Castle from above.

128
00:06:30.391 --> 00:06:32.805
This puppy's gotta fly!

129
00:06:32.977 --> 00:06:35.649

I'm now in control

145
00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:26.817
Captain Busby,

146
00:07:26.918 --> 00:07:28.340
Prepare for take-off.

147
00:07:31.231 --> 00:07:32.301
Paw Patrol!

148
00:07:32.379 --> 00:07:33.614
Thank goodness you're here

149
00:07:33.676 --> 00:07:37.082
to find my Throne
and my missing Sweetie.

150
00:07:37.192 --> 00:07:40.489
Rocky, head inside and see what
you can find in the Throne room.

151
00:07:40.598 --> 00:07:41.754
On it!

152
00:07:41.856 --> 00:07:42.965
Radar scanner.

153
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.953
Nothing suspicious yet.

154
00:07:55.781 --> 00:07:56.875
Hey!

155
00:07:56.914 --> 00:07:59.211
I found a secret
panel in the ceiling!

156
00:07:59.313 --> 00:08:01.469
Maybe the Throne
thief snuck out that way!

157
00:08:01.554 --> 00:08:02.797
Thanks, Rocky!

158
00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:04.867
Skye, time for aerial recon.

159
00:08:04.992 --> 00:08:06.297
Start with the Castle roof.

160
00:08:06.406 --> 00:08:09.383
<i>This pup's going up!</i>

161
00:08:12.756 --> 00:08:13.992
That's strange.

162
00:08:14.046 --> 00:08:17.305
My pup pad's telling me the
Air Patroller just took off.

163
00:08:17.484 --> 00:08:19.125
But who's flying it?

164
00:08:19.477 --> 00:08:21.969
I see the Throne!
It's on the roof!

165
00:08:22.094 --> 00:08:24.013
But no sign of Sweetie.

166
00:08:24.232 --> 00:08:25.530
Huh?!

167
00:08:25.944 --> 00:08:27.778
What's the
Air Patroller doing here?

168
00:08:27.872 --> 00:08:30.318
Whoa!

169
00:08:32.444 --> 00:08:35.561
Ryder, the Air Patroller
took the Throne!

170
00:08:35.662 --> 00:08:38.334
Stay on its tail until
we figure out what's going on!

171
00:08:38.467 --> 00:08:40.256
Roger that!

172
00:08:44.131 --> 00:08:46.695
Ryder!
The thief is Sweetie!

173
00:08:46.765 --> 00:08:51.523
Ahem, that's Queen
Sweetie because I now have

174
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:53.593
The Throne of Barkingburg,

175
00:08:53.718 --> 00:08:55.617
And my autopilot, Busby,

176
00:08:55.734 --> 00:08:58.695
is going to fly me
to my very own kingdom.

177
00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:01.304
<i>I'll be the
Queen of wherever I land.</i>

178
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.101
That pup!

179
00:09:04.202 --> 00:09:06.734
Someone's not getting
her belly rubbed tonight.

180
00:09:06.851 --> 00:09:09.351
Mission Paw is
on your tail, Sweetie!

181
00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.609
Skye, stay with
the Air Patroller!

182
00:09:11.687 --> 00:09:13.023
Trying my best,

183
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.023
But it's super fast.

184
00:09:15.148 --> 00:09:17.952
Robo-dog, don't let
it out of your sight.

185
00:09:30.923 --> 00:09:32.228
She's behind us!

186
00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:33.431
Captain Busby!

187
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:37.931
Let's lose that
Canine and her copter!

188
00:09:40.189 --> 00:09:42.329
Whoa, whoa!

189
00:09:42.511 --> 00:09:43.837
Whoa!

190
00:09:43.978 --> 00:09:45.189
Whew.

191
00:09:47.306 --> 00:09:48.509
Are you okay, Skye?

192
00:09:48.587 --> 00:09:50.572
<i>Yeah, but that was a close one.</i>

193
00:09:50.626 --> 00:09:52.423
Did you see which
direction she went?

194
00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.408
<i>It looks like
she headed southwest.</i>

195
00:09:57.095 --> 00:09:59.626
If she's going that way...

196
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.587
She's taking the
Air Patroller to the jungle!

197
00:10:02.743 --> 00:10:04.009
Hit it, Robo-dog!

198
00:10:13.013 --> 00:10:16.224
I don't have a shovel,
Carlos, but I'll help you dig.

199
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:20.365
Tracker, you could
be an archaeologist pup!

200
00:10:21.599 --> 00:10:24.021
I hear something.

201
00:10:25.854 --> 00:10:27.909
I don't hear any...

202
00:10:28.834 --> 00:10:30.545
Airplane, wow!

203
00:10:30.693 --> 00:10:32.638
Tracker, great ears!

204
00:10:32.717 --> 00:10:34.873
Isn't that the Air Patroller?

205
00:10:35.037 --> 00:10:38.029
Yeah, that's the
Paw badge on the back!

206
00:10:38.622 --> 00:10:39.661
Cool!

207
00:10:39.717 --> 00:10:42.287
It sounds like
they're landing Alli.

208
00:10:42.396 --> 00:10:44.084
Vamos!

209
00:10:51.868 --> 00:10:54.571
Greetings, loyal subjects.

210
00:10:54.728 --> 00:10:58.642
I am Queen Sweetie,
your new ruler!

211
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:01.230
As your Queen,

212
00:11:01.275 --> 00:11:04.728
I command you to give me
all of your precious gems.

213
00:11:07.017 --> 00:11:09.486
Okay, I'll take bananas.

214
00:11:09.962 --> 00:11:13.165
Queen Sweetie deserves
the greatest banana collection

215
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:14.294
in the world!

216
00:11:17.196 --> 00:11:18.713
That's not Ryder

217
00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:20.595
Or any of our Amigos.

218
00:11:20.759 --> 00:11:23.657
But that's definitely
the Air Patroller.

219
00:11:23.767 --> 00:11:25.712
Something's going on.

220
00:11:26.095 --> 00:11:27.657
I better pup tag Ryder.

221
00:11:27.814 --> 00:11:29.219
Ryder!

222
00:11:29.329 --> 00:11:31.282
<i>Soy yo tracker, where are you?</i>

223
00:11:31.307 --> 00:11:33.978
We're just
heading into the jungle.

224
00:11:34.157 --> 00:11:35.415
<i>Well, your Air Patroller's</i>

225
00:11:35.478 --> 00:11:37.595
<i>already here
at the monkey temple.</i>

226
00:11:37.682 --> 00:11:39.111
<i>With a pup we don't know!</i>

227
00:11:39.228 --> 00:11:40.376
Thanks for the tip.

228
00:11:40.446 --> 00:11:43.564
Please keep an eye on her, and
let us know what she's up to.

229
00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:46.798
We'll be there soon!

230
00:11:50.428 --> 00:11:52.029
Yuck!

231
00:11:52.255 --> 00:11:55.240
I guess I don't
really like bananas,

232
00:11:55.313 --> 00:11:58.537
But I do like having all of them

233
00:11:58.709 --> 00:12:01.108
Because I'm
Queen of the monkeys!

234
00:12:01.219 --> 00:12:03.873
Now, carry me into the temple!

235
00:12:11.639 --> 00:12:14.717
What do you mean
you're the monkey Queen?!

236
00:12:14.835 --> 00:12:16.335
You may have the crown,

237
00:12:16.671 --> 00:12:18.662
But I have the Throne!

238
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:23.115
Now, move your
Sweetie into a new Castle.

239
00:12:28.308 --> 00:12:29.756
Oyoyoy!

240
00:12:29.867 --> 00:12:30.967
Los monos!

241
00:12:31.044 --> 00:12:32.537
They're taking sides!

242
00:12:32.635 --> 00:12:34.326
Monkey minions!

243
00:12:34.359 --> 00:12:35.626
Push harder!

244
00:12:54.618 --> 00:12:55.952
Monkeys, cuidado!

245
00:12:56.318 --> 00:12:57.717
Get away from those statues!

246
00:12:57.819 --> 00:13:00.686
Ryder, we have
to stop those statues

247
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.084
from falling on the monkeys!

248
00:13:02.131 --> 00:13:03.155
We're on!

249
00:13:03.187 --> 00:13:04.256
The Paw Patrol?

250
00:13:04.319 --> 00:13:06.334
Time to abandon kingdom.

251
00:13:06.437 --> 00:13:09.248
Monkey subjects,
to the Air Patroller!

252
00:13:09.434 --> 00:13:10.760
Okay, tracker.

253
00:13:10.898 --> 00:13:12.635
Use your cables
to fly Chase's winch

254
00:13:12.677 --> 00:13:14.862
up to the top of that palm tree!

255
00:13:14.909 --> 00:13:16.932
Let's go, tracker!

256
00:13:18.268 --> 00:13:19.690
Cables!

257
00:13:21.853 --> 00:13:25.065
Winch!

258
00:13:32.242 --> 00:13:33.383
It's ready!

259
00:13:33.491 --> 00:13:35.790
Winch, retract!

260
00:13:41.478 --> 00:13:43.039
Thanks, Ryder.

261
00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.017
Hey, guys?

262
00:13:45.331 --> 00:13:47.588
Sweetie's getting away!

263
00:13:51.118 --> 00:13:54.072
Wow, I haven't
even tripped once!

264
00:13:55.036 --> 00:13:56.216
Whoa!

265
00:13:58.005 --> 00:13:59.959
I'm good!

266
00:14:01.669 --> 00:14:04.239
That sneaky
Sweetie got away again!

267
00:14:04.542 --> 00:14:05.700
Sorry, Ryder.

268
00:14:05.754 --> 00:14:06.919
It's okay, Marshall.

269
00:14:06.982 --> 00:14:08.382
We'll catch her next time.

270
00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:09.700
Let's ride!

271
00:14:10.001 --> 00:14:11.504
Good luck, Paw Patrol!

272
00:14:11.575 --> 00:14:14.356
<i>Buena Suerte, Amigos!</i>

273
00:14:17.106 --> 00:14:19.734
<i>Ryder, have you
found my Throne yet?</i>

274
00:14:19.911 --> 00:14:22.333
We did, but
Sweetie got away again.

275
00:14:22.439 --> 00:14:23.794
<i>Oh, that pup.</i>

276
00:14:23.903 --> 00:14:26.200
<i>No more handbag
of treats for her.</i>

277
00:14:26.296 --> 00:14:28.278
Don't worry.
We're still on her trail.

278
00:14:28.411 --> 00:14:30.340
I saw her flying
the Air Patroller south,

279
00:14:30.426 --> 00:14:32.997
And there's only one
thing in that direction.

280
00:14:39.457 --> 00:14:41.270
Greetings, loyal subjects.

281
00:14:41.431 --> 00:14:43.543
I'm Queen... whoa!

282
00:14:50.647 --> 00:14:51.676
Yuck!

283
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.746
I can't stand fish!

284
00:14:53.864 --> 00:14:59.278
My first Royal rule
is never give your ruler fish.

285
00:15:00.074 --> 00:15:02.692
And now, for
my first Royal command.

286
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.129
Build your beloved
Queen an ice Castle!

287
00:15:06.355 --> 00:15:09.082
The most magnificent
Castle ever seen

288
00:15:09.129 --> 00:15:10.153
in...

289
00:15:11.527 --> 00:15:14.239
the south Sweetie pole!

290
00:15:19.974 --> 00:15:22.326
This looks a little
too flat for snowboarding.

291
00:15:22.428 --> 00:15:25.809
Yeah, but it's
great for penguin watching!

292
00:15:26.474 --> 00:15:27.835
It looks like
there's a whole bunch

293
00:15:27.865 --> 00:15:29.826
of our flipper-y
friends over there!

294
00:15:29.851 --> 00:15:30.856
Oh, yeah!

295
00:15:30.881 --> 00:15:32.974
Over there,
by the Air Patroller!

296
00:15:33.253 --> 00:15:34.522
Air Patroller?!

297
00:15:34.766 --> 00:15:36.849
But where's Ryder
and the Paw Patrol?

298
00:15:36.935 --> 00:15:39.987
And look at those penguins
pushing ice around that pup!

299
00:15:40.162 --> 00:15:41.974
I'll pup tag
Ryder and see what's up.

300
00:15:42.028 --> 00:15:44.348
And I'll go say
hi to our new friend!

301
00:15:44.879 --> 00:15:46.838
Whoo-hoo!

302
00:15:48.586 --> 00:15:51.500
Oh, oh, oh!
Don't forget the drawbridge!

303
00:15:51.669 --> 00:15:53.719
Howdy.
Name's Jake.

304
00:15:53.797 --> 00:15:56.047
So, uh, where's Ryder?

305
00:15:56.203 --> 00:15:59.586
Oh, uh, he
let me have his plane.

306
00:15:59.664 --> 00:16:00.687
It's okay.

307
00:16:00.758 --> 00:16:01.828
I'm a Queen.

308
00:16:01.853 --> 00:16:02.883
See?

309
00:16:02.921 --> 00:16:05.078
This is my Royal ice Castle.

310
00:16:05.289 --> 00:16:09.000
And I command you, tall
person, to help finish it.

311
00:16:10.109 --> 00:16:11.891
You're a funny pup.

312
00:16:12.266 --> 00:16:14.750
Go on.
The work won't finish itself.

313
00:16:14.892 --> 00:16:16.078
Uh, okay.

314
00:16:16.151 --> 00:16:17.898
Always glad to help.

315
00:16:19.008 --> 00:16:21.945
So that's what the
Air Patroller is doing here.

316
00:16:22.063 --> 00:16:23.476
That pup took it!

317
00:16:23.585 --> 00:16:25.601
Along with the Throne of Barkingburg!

318
00:16:25.665 --> 00:16:27.875
She wants to use it
to set up her own kingdom.

319
00:16:28.086 --> 00:16:29.328
Can you help us get it back?

320
00:16:29.453 --> 00:16:31.820
Ice or snow, I'm ready to go!

321
00:16:31.905 --> 00:16:33.539
Great!
We're on our way.

322
00:16:33.711 --> 00:16:36.039
Just don't let Sweetie
take off until we get there.

323
00:16:36.226 --> 00:16:37.586
Jake and I won't let you down!

324
00:16:38.723 --> 00:16:40.101
Rocky, it's time for you

325
00:16:40.141 --> 00:16:42.539
to do some
extraordinary gadget making.

326
00:16:42.609 --> 00:16:45.359
We need a device that will take
control of the Air Patroller.

327
00:16:45.516 --> 00:16:48.930
Wow, good thing we travel
with a lot of spare parts!

328
00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.398
'cause I don't
lose it, I reuse it!

329
00:16:58.064 --> 00:16:59.423
Bigger!
Bigger!

330
00:16:59.509 --> 00:17:03.710
I want the biggest, most
magnificent ice Castle ever!

331
00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:05.720
Oh, hi, Everest!

332
00:17:05.789 --> 00:17:07.589
Wanna help us
make an ice Castle?

333
00:17:09.203 --> 00:17:11.274
I'm playing
along so I can figure out

334
00:17:11.342 --> 00:17:12.493
What she's up to!

335
00:17:12.587 --> 00:17:14.001
She's up to no good.

336
00:17:14.173 --> 00:17:17.892
Jake, that pup took the
Air Patroller and that Throne.

337
00:17:18.001 --> 00:17:20.884
We've got to stall her
till the Paw Patrol gets here!

338
00:17:20.953 --> 00:17:22.095
Hello!

339
00:17:22.134 --> 00:17:24.938
There are no breaks
in the South Sweetie Pole.

340
00:17:25.017 --> 00:17:26.134
Okey dokey, Sweetie.

341
00:17:26.182 --> 00:17:30.228
Queen Sweetie, or
your most gracious Majesty.

342
00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.040
Let's push this ice
chunk so it blocks her in!

343
00:17:33.106 --> 00:17:34.368
Good plan!

344
00:17:34.639 --> 00:17:36.636
Lend a flipper, penguins!

345
00:17:39.816 --> 00:17:41.667
Hey, I can't get out!

346
00:17:41.808 --> 00:17:44.566
I command you to
build a Castle back door!

347
00:17:44.698 --> 00:17:46.292
Sorry, meanie Queenie,

348
00:17:46.362 --> 00:17:49.183
You're staying there
till the Paw Patrol gets here!

349
00:17:49.278 --> 00:17:51.253
I don't think so.

350
00:17:52.644 --> 00:17:53.720
Claw!

351
00:17:53.745 --> 00:17:57.144
Fresh fish to the first
penguin who builds a staircase

352
00:17:57.212 --> 00:18:00.003
That helps your Queen get out!

353
00:18:04.247 --> 00:18:05.324
Whoa!

354
00:18:05.462 --> 00:18:06.769
She played the fish card!

355
00:18:06.811 --> 00:18:07.977
Uh-oh!

356
00:18:08.088 --> 00:18:11.207
That Castle is
getting too heavy for this ice!

357
00:18:11.334 --> 00:18:14.379
Penguins, no!
The ice is going to break!

358
00:18:14.477 --> 00:18:17.445
Get away from that Castle!

359
00:18:17.596 --> 00:18:18.796
Whoa!

360
00:18:18.954 --> 00:18:21.588
Penguins
should not build Castles!

361
00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:24.547
Come on, little fella!

362
00:18:24.608 --> 00:18:25.616
I'll save you!

363
00:18:26.742 --> 00:18:27.826
Whoa!

364
00:18:28.048 --> 00:18:30.022
my Throne!

365
00:18:30.202 --> 00:18:32.452
I'll get it back
with the Air Patroller!

366
00:18:32.639 --> 00:18:36.108
Jake, penguins can
swim in freezing cold water!

367
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.584
You can't!

368
00:18:37.723 --> 00:18:38.723
Oh, yeah!

369
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:40.038
Whoa!

370
00:18:40.473 --> 00:18:42.022
That was close!

371
00:18:42.123 --> 00:18:43.256
I'll get you!

372
00:18:43.281 --> 00:18:44.333
Everest!

373
00:18:44.358 --> 00:18:46.983
You've got to stop
Sweetie before she takes off!

374
00:18:47.077 --> 00:18:49.176
I'm okay.
You can get me later!

375
00:18:50.285 --> 00:18:52.405
Snowboard!

376
00:19:07.039 --> 00:19:08.326
Sorry, Ryder.

377
00:19:08.432 --> 00:19:10.391
We stalled her
as long as we could.

378
00:19:10.471 --> 00:19:12.068
It was a good try, Everest.

379
00:19:12.235 --> 00:19:14.547
And look, she left the Throne!

380
00:19:14.618 --> 00:19:15.735
Yeah!

381
00:19:15.845 --> 00:19:17.685
It's getting
a little small here.

382
00:19:17.914 --> 00:19:20.649
Zuma, use your
mini-sub to rescue Jake!

383
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:23.297
Let's dive in!

384
00:19:29.854 --> 00:19:32.205
Scuba!

385
00:19:35.003 --> 00:19:38.641
Hang in there, Jake!

386
00:19:42.044 --> 00:19:43.450
Oh, thanks!

387
00:19:43.575 --> 00:19:47.325
Kinda like water-skiing
but a whole lot chillier.

388
00:19:48.165 --> 00:19:49.700
Way to go!

389
00:19:54.425 --> 00:19:56.667
Sweetie's going to
grab the Throne back!

390
00:19:56.769 --> 00:19:58.964
And take that
poor penguin with it!

391
00:19:59.089 --> 00:20:02.457
Everest, use your
snowboard to save that bird!

392
00:20:02.483 --> 00:20:05.623
Surf's up!

393
00:20:08.195 --> 00:20:11.568
Hurry, penguin! Come on!

394
00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:14.487
At least that little penguin

395
00:20:14.565 --> 00:20:16.534
won't be taking
a trip with Sweetie!

396
00:20:16.667 --> 00:20:20.807
Yeah, but that no-good pup
is getting away with the Throne!

397
00:20:20.962 --> 00:20:22.073
Not for long.

398
00:20:22.173 --> 00:20:24.245
Is your plane
controller ready, Rocky?

399
00:20:24.375 --> 00:20:26.042
Yup, it's ready!

400
00:20:26.174 --> 00:20:29.253
Marshall, use your hydro
launcher to blast Rocky's gadget

401
00:20:29.307 --> 00:20:30.576
onto the Air Patroller!

402
00:20:30.659 --> 00:20:33.821
Hydro launcher!

403
00:20:35.654 --> 00:20:38.130
Your serve, Marshall!

404
00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.162
Nice shot, pups!

405
00:20:44.209 --> 00:20:47.030
Rocky, get control of
our plane and bring it back!

406
00:20:47.198 --> 00:20:49.436
Roger that, Ryder!

407
00:20:52.936 --> 00:20:54.201
It's working!

408
00:20:54.351 --> 00:20:55.694
Captain Busby!

409
00:20:55.799 --> 00:20:57.483
You're flying the wrong way!

410
00:20:59.584 --> 00:21:01.756
The Paw Patrol
must have done something!

411
00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.780
Fine!
I'll fly this thing myself.

412
00:21:05.124 --> 00:21:06.905
Whoa!

413
00:21:07.098 --> 00:21:08.795
<i>I'm afraid not, Sweetie.</i>

414
00:21:08.912 --> 00:21:12.225
<i>Mission Paw is controlling
the Air Patroller now!</i>

415
00:21:15.342 --> 00:21:18.389
Okay, okay!
I give up!

416
00:21:18.499 --> 00:21:21.639
Just stop this awful ride!

417
00:21:24.561 --> 00:21:27.421
Think we're ready
to head back to Barkingburg!

418
00:21:30.184 --> 00:21:32.137
Still no sign of the Paw Patrol

419
00:21:32.311 --> 00:21:34.458
or my beautiful Throne.

420
00:21:37.844 --> 00:21:39.420
It's the Air Patroller!

421
00:21:39.779 --> 00:21:41.333
With my Throne!

422
00:21:41.731 --> 00:21:44.504
And here comes
the Mission Cruiser!

423
00:21:47.347 --> 00:21:50.957
Okay, Rocky.
Bring her in for a landing!

424
00:21:53.958 --> 00:21:55.392
Wha... whoa!

425
00:21:55.654 --> 00:21:59.136
Oops, I didn't mean to do that!

426
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:06.471
Greetings, loyal subjects.

427
00:22:06.634 --> 00:22:08.936
I am Queen...

428
00:22:13.204 --> 00:22:16.385
I really can't stand fish.

429
00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.596
My poor soggy Sweetie!

430
00:22:18.686 --> 00:22:20.174
Come here.

431
00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:25.189
Now, that's a Royal
smile, your highness.

432
00:22:25.283 --> 00:22:27.744
Thank you, pups,
for saving the Royal Throne

433
00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.963
and giving the princess
a reason to smile again!

434
00:22:31.101 --> 00:22:32.752
No problem, your Earlness.

435
00:22:32.916 --> 00:22:34.713
Whenever you
have a Royal problem,

436
00:22:34.827 --> 00:22:37.057
Just say "Cheese" for help!

437
00:22:38.258 --> 00:22:40.534
Except for my naughty Sweetie!

438
00:22:40.635 --> 00:22:42.807
She says, "I'm sorry!"

439
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:44.213
Cheese!

440
00:22:44.315 --> 00:22:46.103
I'm sorry!

441
00:22:46.267 --> 00:22:47.713
Sorta.
