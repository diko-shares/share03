[theme song playing]

2
00:01:20.591 --> 00:01:23.343
Oh, mans. It's glorious!

3
00:01:23.427 --> 00:01:25.971
Watching TV will never be the same.

4
00:01:26.055 --> 00:01:29.433
Can you believe someone was just
throwing this beauty away?

5
00:01:29.516 --> 00:01:31.977
I mean this baby's got it all!

6
00:01:32.394 --> 00:01:34.813
That pristine wood foam laminate.

7
00:01:34.897 --> 00:01:37.983
Brackets for CDs, DVDs, cassettes,

8
00:01:38.067 --> 00:01:40.194
all kinds of obsolete physical media.

9
00:01:41.236 --> 00:01:43.405
A family of marmots
living in a stereo drawer.

10
00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:44.323
[marmots squeaking]

11
00:01:44.406 --> 00:01:47.868
And do not forget the shelving
for all of our many books.

12
00:01:49.536 --> 00:01:51.163
[all laughing]

13
00:01:53.165 --> 00:01:54.083
[Robin grunts]

14
00:01:54.375 --> 00:01:55.250
Ain't no thang.

15
00:01:55.334 --> 00:01:57.336
We just got to find something
to wedge under its.

16
00:01:58.754 --> 00:02:01.006
Hmm. Hmm.

17
00:02:07.304 --> 00:02:09.098
Think harder, genius.

18
00:02:14.812 --> 00:02:16.480
Yo, this little squidgy will do.

19
00:02:18.857 --> 00:02:21.068
Nice work! Now to see what's on.

20
00:02:21.151 --> 00:02:23.737
-[remote clicks]
-Hello, Titans!

21
00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:25.072
Control Freak?

22
00:02:25.155 --> 00:02:27.449
What madness
do you have in store this time?

23
00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:29.326
You gonna turn us into claymation?

24
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.703
Make us hawk food processors

25
00:02:30.786 --> 00:02:33.038
in some tacky three-camera infomercial?

26
00:02:33.122 --> 00:02:34.998
Twist us into
a gritty live-action series

27
00:02:35.082 --> 00:02:36.792
targeted at adult audiences?

28
00:02:36.875 --> 00:02:39.920
That's been done. So gritty.

29
00:02:40.003 --> 00:02:43.549
Oh, weren't you clods paying attention
to the opening credits?

30
00:02:43.632 --> 00:02:45.676
In our defense, we were getting
this thing up the stairs.

31
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.970
This is your...

32
00:02:48.053 --> 00:02:51.098
[reading] Super Hero Team
Crossover Event!

33
00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:52.516
[party horns squeak flatly]

34
00:02:53.058 --> 00:02:55.018
You mean like another movie?

35
00:02:55.102 --> 00:02:56.603
Uh, did I say, movie?

36
00:02:56.687 --> 00:03:00.023
[groans] Not a crossover.
That's when a lame show

37
00:03:00.107 --> 00:03:03.527
tries to glom onto a cooler one in order
to boost their popularity.

38
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.740
-Oh, no! Are we's being canceled?
-One can only hope.

39
00:03:08.365 --> 00:03:10.325
Everyone knows a good crossover
has to have

40
00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.037
some epic threat that brings the heroes
from two worlds together.

41
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.789
And epic threats just aren't our thing.

42
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.002
Who said this was
a good crossover, huh?

43
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.422
[gulps] He means business, Titans.

44
00:03:23.505 --> 00:03:25.090
We'd better play along. [grunts]

45
00:03:28.218 --> 00:03:30.345
Robin, please, what are you doing?

46
00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:31.930
In superhero crossovers,

47
00:03:32.014 --> 00:03:34.266
each team is introduced
in an action set piece,

48
00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.810
you know, to remind the audience
how awesome the heroes are

49
00:03:36.894 --> 00:03:38.771
even before they meet
their counterparts.

50
00:03:38.854 --> 00:03:41.607
Quick, everybody, do something action-y,
before they cut away to the other h--

51
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.358
[thrilling music playing]

52
00:03:45.152 --> 00:03:46.987
[Catwoman] The superhero girls?

53
00:03:47.071 --> 00:03:49.823
But our plan for this heist
was purr-fect.

54
00:03:56.205 --> 00:03:57.164
[meows]

55
00:03:57.873 --> 00:03:59.875
Oh, oh, sorry, Mittens.

56
00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.711
No matter how "purr-fect" your plan is,

57
00:04:02.795 --> 00:04:05.672
our captain is always
gonna have a perfecter one.

58
00:04:05.756 --> 00:04:08.008
I'm flattered. But it is a team effort.

59
00:04:09.218 --> 00:04:10.636
[grunting]

60
00:04:10.844 --> 00:04:13.222
-[grunting]
-[Harley Quinn] Peek-a-boo!

61
00:04:13.305 --> 00:04:15.182
-I whomp you!
-[grunts]

62
00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.684
-Zatanna!
-I got her!

63
00:04:17.976 --> 00:04:19.978
[screams, grunts]

64
00:04:20.062 --> 00:04:21.730
-[laughs]
-[grunts]

65
00:04:21.814 --> 00:04:23.482
That's my friend, Harleen.

66
00:04:23.857 --> 00:04:26.860
Oh, you care about
your friends now, Babs?

67
00:04:26.944 --> 00:04:28.987
I do, when they're not supervillains.

68
00:04:29.071 --> 00:04:30.989
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

69
00:04:31.073 --> 00:04:32.282
Zee, are you okay?

70
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.076
[growls]

71
00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:37.830
Wha-- Oh, yeah. Totally.

72
00:04:37.996 --> 00:04:38.914
How are you?

73
00:04:42.418 --> 00:04:45.587
One of these days, we're going to crush
you jerks! And...

74
00:04:45.671 --> 00:04:46.880
Wait. What's this?

75
00:04:46.964 --> 00:04:50.300
Ah, who cares what it is.
It's bustin' us free!

76
00:04:50.384 --> 00:04:52.344
So long, clowns!

77
00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:00.227
[scoffs] Let me guess.
Creepy purple cloud got 'em?

78
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.062
Exactly. How did you know?

79
00:05:02.688 --> 00:05:05.566
Same thing happened to me last week
when I took Solomon Grundy down.

80
00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:07.317
And when I was pounding on the Riddler.

81
00:05:07.401 --> 00:05:09.987
Yesterday, I stopped
both Toyman and Cheetah.

82
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.614
Each time...
[makes whooshing sounds] gone.

83
00:05:15.325 --> 00:05:19.705
Uh... Oh, nothing happened
to the bad guys I caught this week.

84
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.791
Of course, I didn't catch any bad guys,

85
00:05:23.208 --> 00:05:26.003
but I did help my neighbor
find his lost cat.

86
00:05:27.421 --> 00:05:29.256
Sounds like we have a mystery to solve.

87
00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:33.510
Babs, I think what you meant to say
is, "we" have a mystery to solve.

88
00:05:33.594 --> 00:05:35.429
Boys, there's no need to compete.

89
00:05:35.512 --> 00:05:38.015
-Now! Go!
-[girls laughing]

90
00:05:38.098 --> 00:05:39.683
-[boys grunting]
-We'll let you know

91
00:05:39.767 --> 00:05:41.685
where the bad guys went
after we find 'em!

92
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.106
[Lex Luthor] I know what
you're asking yourselves.

93
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.025
What would a multi-billionaire like me

94
00:05:48.108 --> 00:05:50.444
want with such an eclectic group of...

95
00:05:50.527 --> 00:05:51.987
-you?
-[toilet flushes]

96
00:05:53.155 --> 00:05:55.365
This Hall of Doom
must've cost you a mint.

97
00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:58.535
You think you could afford a decent
hand-dryer in the ladies room?

98
00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.623
-[squishing sounds]
-Ew, real fur?

99
00:06:02.706 --> 00:06:04.792
-What are you, like, an actual cat?
-[growls softly]

100
00:06:04.875 --> 00:06:08.087
-Hey, Selina, eat your heart out.
-[Lex clears throat]

101
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.883
What if I told you I hold the power
to get rid of every superhero?

102
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:18.097
While searching through
the remains of Krypton,

103
00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.017
my space probe came across
The Amulet of Cythonna.

104
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:26.230
This device uses an ancient science
even I have yet to understand.

105
00:06:26.313 --> 00:06:29.608
-But its power is undeniable.
-[Grundy scoffs]

106
00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:32.945
Power? Luthor no find trinket in space.

107
00:06:33.028 --> 00:06:35.906
Luthor find trinket in cereal box.

108
00:06:35.989 --> 00:06:37.741
[villains laugh boisterously]

109
00:06:39.743 --> 00:06:43.747
If it weren't for this, Chuckles,
you'd be in jail now.

110
00:06:43.997 --> 00:06:46.166
But if you are still not convinced...

111
00:06:47.626 --> 00:06:48.919
[grunts]

112
00:06:50.546 --> 00:06:54.383
-Uh, where'd he go?
-They call it the Phantom Zone.

113
00:06:54.466 --> 00:06:58.011
But you can think of it as our own
personal superhero dumping ground.

114
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.515
[screams, grunts]

115
00:07:02.224 --> 00:07:05.477
[growls] If you have that,
why do you need us?

116
00:07:06.103 --> 00:07:09.773
Someone's gotta lure all those heroes
into our little trap.

117
00:07:09.857 --> 00:07:12.693
[Jessica] These are the spots
the mist was seen.

118
00:07:12.776 --> 00:07:14.278
Hmm. I don't see a pattern.

119
00:07:14.361 --> 00:07:16.488
But if you squint just right,
it kind of looks like a puppy.

120
00:07:16.572 --> 00:07:18.532
Come on, Babs. We have to ke--

121
00:07:18.615 --> 00:07:20.909
-Aw...
-Guys, check this out.

122
00:07:21.493 --> 00:07:23.245
See something in your armor-cam video?

123
00:07:23.328 --> 00:07:25.205
Not see, hear.

124
00:07:25.914 --> 00:07:29.334
-Just listen.
-[man] <i>Cythonna.</i>

125
00:07:29.418 --> 00:07:32.087
Uh, is it saying, cellphones?

126
00:07:32.171 --> 00:07:37.134
-Sounds more like "syphon oats."
-She's saying Cythonna.

127
00:07:37.551 --> 00:07:39.636
But that's impossible.

128
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.138
What is Cythonna?

129
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.307
Well, not what. Who.

130
00:07:43.682 --> 00:07:47.436
I mean, even a planet of science dorks
like Krypton had its mythology,

131
00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:51.690
and Cythonna was the goddess
of darkness, blight, and suffering.

132
00:07:51.774 --> 00:07:54.109
Yeesh. Bet she was a blast at parties.

133
00:07:54.193 --> 00:07:57.237
Story goes, she ran the show
on Krypton for centuries,

134
00:07:57.321 --> 00:08:00.866
<i>which was pretty much a hot heap</i>
<i>of stink for all concerned,</i>

135
00:08:00.949 --> 00:08:04.870
<i>until, one day, her kid brother, Rao,</i>
<i>god of sun and other stuff,</i>

136
00:08:04.953 --> 00:08:08.582
<i>trapped her in an amulet</i>
<i>and chucked her into space.</i>

137
00:08:09.083 --> 00:08:11.919
So while kids here are told to wish upon
a shooting star,

138
00:08:12.002 --> 00:08:17.424
we were told to behave, it could be
Cythonna coming to get you.

139
00:08:17.508 --> 00:08:19.468
And did you believe that?

140
00:08:19.551 --> 00:08:21.804
What? No! No. I'm from Krypton.

141
00:08:21.887 --> 00:08:26.558
No one believed in ancient
yet terrifying myths like that.

142
00:08:26.642 --> 00:08:29.228
So, yeah, let's just talk about
something else, all right?

143
00:08:29.311 --> 00:08:31.438
Did I hear there's a map
that looks like a puppy?

144
00:08:34.775 --> 00:08:38.153
'Sup nerds? Mind if we play?

Hey, Giganta! You're not gonna
disappear this time.

148
00:08:49.623 --> 00:08:52.543
Oh, we ain't disappearing. You are!

149
00:08:52.876 --> 00:08:54.962
-Huh?
-[both scream]

150
00:08:56.255 --> 00:08:58.424
That's what happens to any superhero

151
00:08:58.507 --> 00:09:01.885
dumb enough to face the Legion of Doom!

[Green Lantern] Hmph!

Oh, no! [screaming]

162
00:09:42.551 --> 00:09:45.804
Oh, this is terrible!

163
00:09:45.888 --> 00:09:48.807
-Chin up, Garth. We're not done yet.
-No!

164
00:09:48.891 --> 00:09:51.894
Mr. Goodberry's cat got out again!

Hey, half-pint, you calling to say you
guys give up looking for the bad guys?

[Garth] <i>No, we found them,</i>
<i>and it's not great.</i>

-Wait. Garth, are you okay? Talk to me.
-[cellphone beeps]

170
00:10:08.035 --> 00:10:11.914
They've teamed up, and we think they got
Ollie, Hal, and Barry too.

171
00:10:11.997 --> 00:10:15.709
They call themselves the Legacy of Doom!

172
00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:17.753
[Hawkman] <i>It's the Legion of Doom,</i>
<i>Garth.</i>

173
00:10:17.961 --> 00:10:19.088
[Garth] <i>Really?</i>

174
00:10:19.171 --> 00:10:21.006
<i>I could swear Livewire said...</i>

175
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.801
Guys, prioritize details. Where are you?

176
00:10:23.884 --> 00:10:25.427
The park! Hurry!

177
00:10:25.511 --> 00:10:28.347
I can't... hold... [screams]

178
00:10:30.516 --> 00:10:33.394
-[phone beeps]
-Team, to the park.

179
00:10:55.207 --> 00:10:57.835
Any sign of them? Oh, no.

180
00:10:59.503 --> 00:11:01.046
Hawkman's mace.

181
00:11:01.422 --> 00:11:03.924
-You don't think...
-[gasps] Hey, what's that?

182
00:11:04.007 --> 00:11:05.467
[chants incantation]

183
00:11:10.514 --> 00:11:13.517
It looks Kryptonian,
or maybe ancient Kryptonian,

184
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.060
because I can only make out

185
00:11:15.144 --> 00:11:16.854
a few of the... the words.

186
00:11:17.396 --> 00:11:19.565
Oh. Oh, that's not good.

187
00:11:19.648 --> 00:11:21.024
What? What does it say?

188
00:11:21.108 --> 00:11:23.861
I think this thing sent our friends
to the Phantom Zone.

189
00:11:24.278 --> 00:11:26.113
You mean that creepy limbo dimension?

190
00:11:26.488 --> 00:11:28.782
But we saw what it took
to open a portal.

191
00:11:28.866 --> 00:11:29.992
How can one little ball...

192
00:11:30.075 --> 00:11:32.619
Cythonna. I'm not sure
what the rest of this says,

193
00:11:32.703 --> 00:11:35.664
but I know this says Cythonna.

194
00:11:37.291 --> 00:11:38.709
Clearly, whatever we're up against

195
00:11:38.792 --> 00:11:41.670
is far more formidable
than we anticipated.

196
00:11:41.754 --> 00:11:42.921
We will need a plan.

197
00:11:43.005 --> 00:11:44.465
How's this for a plan?

198
00:11:44.548 --> 00:11:47.384
Find the jerks who are using stuff
from my dead homeworld

199
00:11:47.468 --> 00:11:51.388
to hurt our friends and,
formidable or not, take 'em down.

200
00:11:51.472 --> 00:11:53.807
But how do we find this Legion of Doom?

201
00:11:53.891 --> 00:11:57.144
BT dubs, very cool name.
Makes you wish

202
00:11:57.227 --> 00:11:59.480
we put a little more effort
into Super Hero Girls.

203
00:11:59.563 --> 00:12:02.608
I got a hunch this little guy
might be our biggest clue.

204
00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:06.195
Kara, where are you going?

205
00:12:06.278 --> 00:12:08.030
To see a translator.

206
00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:12.117
[laughs] Legion of Doom?
That's rich.

207
00:12:12.201 --> 00:12:14.495
Quit it. I think they used
Kryptonian magic

208
00:12:14.578 --> 00:12:16.538
to send my friends to the Phantom Zone.

209
00:12:17.164 --> 00:12:18.999
See, this says Cythonna.

210
00:12:19.875 --> 00:12:22.419
[sighs] Your Kryptonian is awful.

211
00:12:22.503 --> 00:12:23.962
This doesn't say Cythonna.

212
00:12:24.046 --> 00:12:28.342
And even if it did, hello, there's no
such thing as Kryptonian magic.

213
00:12:28.425 --> 00:12:32.471
-Cythonna is a fairy tale.
-You think this is a joke?

214
00:12:32.554 --> 00:12:36.517
I'm sure your buddies are probably
just off goofing around somewhere.

215
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.268
"Goofing around"?

216
00:12:38.352 --> 00:12:40.479
Remember when you couldn't
find that one kid for two days

217
00:12:40.562 --> 00:12:42.398
because he locked himself
in a port-a-pooper?

218
00:12:42.481 --> 00:12:44.525
Garth was only locked inside one day.

219
00:12:44.608 --> 00:12:46.568
He spent the second day in the shower.

220
00:12:46.652 --> 00:12:49.863
Look, Kara. This has been fun.
But if I thought for a second

221
00:12:49.947 --> 00:12:52.282
your pals were in danger
or someone got ahold

222
00:12:52.366 --> 00:12:55.869
of a Kryptonian weapon,
believe me, I'd be all over it.

223
00:12:57.371 --> 00:12:58.372
Hmph!

224
00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:01.583
She knows about the Phantom Zone.

225
00:13:08.382 --> 00:13:09.675
Still no guesses?

226
00:13:10.134 --> 00:13:11.009
I'll give you a hint.

227
00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:13.929
It's not bigger than a breadbox.

228
00:13:15.723 --> 00:13:16.765
Anyone?

229
00:13:17.891 --> 00:13:19.810
Okay. One more hint.

230
00:13:20.102 --> 00:13:23.605
It's not smaller than a breadbox either.

231
00:13:24.064 --> 00:13:26.734
Hal, I ran an hour out
in all directions.

232
00:13:26.817 --> 00:13:27.818
Nothing?

233
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:31.405
Argh! And my ring still can't seem
to penetrate this darkness.

234
00:13:31.488 --> 00:13:32.448
I hate to say this.

235
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:36.118
-We're stuck here.
-[Garth] Give up?

236
00:13:36.785 --> 00:13:40.080
It is a breadbox! Gotcha!

237
00:13:45.753 --> 00:13:47.546
[grunting]

238
00:13:49.256 --> 00:13:51.091
I failed.

239
00:13:51.175 --> 00:13:54.178
-I am sorry, Mother.
-Sorry?

240
00:13:54.553 --> 00:13:57.514
"Sorry" will not shield you
from a vengeful enemy.

241
00:13:57.598 --> 00:14:00.476
Nor will it shield those who follow you.

242
00:14:04.313 --> 00:14:05.606
-[gasps]
-Worried about the Legion of Doom?

243
00:14:05.689 --> 00:14:06.523
[mace thuds]

244
00:14:06.607 --> 00:14:09.401
Why? Are you concerned
a miscalculation in my leadership

245
00:14:09.485 --> 00:14:11.612
against this unknown evil
may bring you harm?

246
00:14:11.695 --> 00:14:15.407
Do you not realize I love you all
too much to allow that to happen?

247
00:14:15.491 --> 00:14:17.242
Zeus as my witness,
Barbara Gordon,

248
00:14:17.326 --> 00:14:18.994
that will not happen!

249
00:14:19.078 --> 00:14:21.163
Uh, thanks, D. I love you too.

250
00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:26.043
No, I was actually thinking about
the Legion because of Harleen.

251
00:14:26.418 --> 00:14:29.213
I thought, since we found out
each other's secret, she'd,

252
00:14:29.296 --> 00:14:31.298
-you know...
-Change her ways.

253
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:34.134
I know Harleen, Diana. She's not evil.

254
00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:37.513
It is heartbreaking, but you do realize
that, for months,

255
00:14:37.596 --> 00:14:40.391
Harley Quinn has held a supervillain's
deadliest weapon.

256
00:14:40.474 --> 00:14:42.518
A heat-seeking poison-tipped scimitar?

257
00:14:42.601 --> 00:14:44.561
Your secret identity.

258
00:14:44.645 --> 00:14:47.856
She knows who you are, and yet,
has done nothing about it.

259
00:14:48.857 --> 00:14:52.027
You're right. So, I guess there is hope.

260
00:14:52.111 --> 00:14:53.779
[Supergirl groaning]

261
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.574
Well, Super-jerk blew me off.

262
00:14:58.117 --> 00:14:59.410
[whispering] They still don't know.

263
00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.246
He would not help translate that sphere?

264
00:15:02.329 --> 00:15:05.165
Hmm. If only we had an ancient
Kryptonian-to-English dictionary

265
00:15:05.249 --> 00:15:06.625
lying around, huh?

266
00:15:07.084 --> 00:15:11.255
Actually, I know where we could find
something way better than a dictionary.

267
00:15:13.799 --> 00:15:16.343
[Zatanna exclaims] My heat spell
maybe keeping me warm,

268
00:15:16.427 --> 00:15:19.430
but this drastic climate change
is going to be murder on my hair.

269
00:15:19.513 --> 00:15:21.932
Okay, Zee.
Don't worry. Not much farther.

270
00:15:22.015 --> 00:15:24.685
-Not much farther to what?
-That!

271
00:15:41.035 --> 00:15:44.163
-Are you sure it's okay we're here?
-Totally not. No.

272
00:15:44.246 --> 00:15:46.582
That's why he calls it
his Fortress of Solitude,

273
00:15:46.665 --> 00:15:48.208
and not, I don't know, a...

274
00:15:48.292 --> 00:15:49.960
The Buddy Bunker?
Friendship Depot?

275
00:15:50.044 --> 00:15:51.879
Ooh. Kal-El's House of ha-has.

276
00:15:51.962 --> 00:15:53.422
Stop right there.

277
00:15:56.675 --> 00:15:59.011
Oh, we're in so much trouble.

278
00:15:59.094 --> 00:16:00.554
Stop right there.

279
00:16:02.765 --> 00:16:04.641
[Supermen] Stop right there.

280
00:16:04.725 --> 00:16:06.477
Stop right there.

281
00:16:07.853 --> 00:16:11.940
Kara, how many last sons
did Krypton actually have?

282
00:16:12.191 --> 00:16:14.610
Relax, these are
just his dumb robot guards.

283
00:16:14.693 --> 00:16:16.403
Hey, they're tall, tan, and gruesome.

284
00:16:16.487 --> 00:16:19.114
It's cousin Kara. I-- Ow!

285
00:16:19.406 --> 00:16:22.159
Huh? This one must have
a loose circuit or something.

286
00:16:22.242 --> 00:16:23.994
Just gonna take a quick look-see.

287
00:16:27.331 --> 00:16:31.126
Okay. Which one of you
glorified coffee makers is next?

288
00:16:44.598 --> 00:16:45.724
[electricity crackles]

289
00:16:45.891 --> 00:16:47.726
[chants incantation]

290
00:16:47.935 --> 00:16:49.436
[straining]

291
00:16:50.437 --> 00:16:51.772
[whimpering]

292
00:16:55.692 --> 00:16:57.361
[both grunting]

293
00:17:00.989 --> 00:17:02.908
[grunts] Ha-ha.

294
00:17:07.871 --> 00:17:10.082
Hmph! Gotta say, not impressed.

295
00:17:10.165 --> 00:17:12.918
-Where is Supergirl?
-[Supergirl] She's over here, gang.

296
00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:15.838
Good news, she got what we came for.

297
00:17:15.921 --> 00:17:18.340
Ta-daa! Told you we'd be in and out.

298
00:17:18.424 --> 00:17:20.759
You sure did. In fact, you can say

299
00:17:20.843 --> 00:17:23.679
you were a-head of the game. [chuckles]

300
00:17:23.762 --> 00:17:26.765
[laughing] Oh, you're so funny.
Oh, you're so funny.

301
00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:28.559
Guys, guys, I'm doing a...

302
00:17:28.642 --> 00:17:29.560
talking as both of us...

303
00:17:32.688 --> 00:17:33.564
[groans]

304
00:17:37.067 --> 00:17:39.069
So, Kara, what's in that case, anyway?

305
00:17:39.486 --> 00:17:42.698
[Supergirl] This is Krypton's
entire wealth of knowledge.

306
00:17:42.781 --> 00:17:45.242
It'll give us the true poop
on Cythonna and her amulet.

307
00:17:45.826 --> 00:17:46.744
Wow.

308
00:17:46.827 --> 00:17:50.414
A complete culture stored
in just a handful of crystals.

309
00:17:50.497 --> 00:17:54.001
[chuckles] Oh, yeah.
Kryptonians loved their crystals.

310
00:17:54.126 --> 00:17:56.211
These babies hold all kinds of things.

311
00:17:58.922 --> 00:17:59.882
Funny.

312
00:18:00.424 --> 00:18:01.967
I don't recall inviting guests.

313
00:18:02.718 --> 00:18:05.637
Another robot? I got this one.

314
00:18:05.721 --> 00:18:06.680
Batgirl, wait!

315
00:18:07.806 --> 00:18:09.183
[grunts] Ow!

316
00:18:09.266 --> 00:18:10.434
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

317
00:18:10.517 --> 00:18:12.186
He's real, he's real,
he's real, he's real!

318
00:18:13.187 --> 00:18:15.022
Put the crystals back, Kara.

319
00:18:15.731 --> 00:18:18.984
No way. Listen, Clark, I know
you don't believe me,

320
00:18:19.068 --> 00:18:21.070
but there is a huge threat.

321
00:18:21.695 --> 00:18:24.323
-I do believe you.
-Don't interrupt me!

322
00:18:24.406 --> 00:18:26.617
-Wait. Wha...
-You're right.

323
00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.828
In fact, I already knew Lex Luthor
is behind the Legion of Doom,

324
00:18:29.912 --> 00:18:31.830
and that they're sending heroes
to the Phantom Zone

325
00:18:31.914 --> 00:18:35.084
-using a Kryptonian device.
-The Amulet of Cythonna.

326
00:18:35.167 --> 00:18:39.004
Wait, so, if you knew all of this,
why did you blow me off at your place?

327
00:18:39.088 --> 00:18:41.840
Because I also knew
you're out of your league.

328
00:18:41.924 --> 00:18:44.134
Luthor is not to be trifled with.

329
00:18:44.218 --> 00:18:46.011
We've taken him down before.

330
00:18:46.095 --> 00:18:48.555
Not with a deadly weapon
like this, you haven't.

331
00:18:48.639 --> 00:18:51.517
I know Luthor. This time,
he's playing for keeps.

332
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.893
What are you saying?

333
00:18:52.976 --> 00:18:54.353
What kind of hero would I be

334
00:18:54.436 --> 00:18:56.105
if I let a bunch of kids
walk off to their doom?

335
00:18:58.023 --> 00:18:59.566
Thanks, Dad.

336
00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:01.860
You think you could stop us on your own?

337
00:19:02.653 --> 00:19:05.489
Yeah, I do. But even if I couldn't...

338
00:19:10.869 --> 00:19:12.830
[Hawaiian tune plays]

339
00:19:12.913 --> 00:19:14.415
[exclaims]

340
00:19:21.588 --> 00:19:23.132
the Justice League could.

341
00:19:23.799 --> 00:19:27.094
The Justice League?
Another cool name!

342
00:19:27.511 --> 00:19:29.805
Yeah, I wanted to call ourselves
the Super Friends, man.

343
00:19:29.888 --> 00:19:31.265
But I got out-voted.

344
00:19:31.348 --> 00:19:32.975
[sighs] So unfair.

345
00:19:33.434 --> 00:19:36.979
I mean, we appreciate
the concern, gentlemen,

346
00:19:37.062 --> 00:19:39.481
but we are more than capable
of handling ourselves.

347
00:19:40.399 --> 00:19:42.359
Yeah, Jon, you helped train me on Oa.

348
00:19:42.443 --> 00:19:44.027
I was the top of my class.

349
00:19:44.111 --> 00:19:46.321
Sorry, rookie.
Pacifism won't cut it this time.

350
00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:47.865
Punches have got to be thrown.

351
00:19:48.991 --> 00:19:50.367
[Batgirl exhales] This is just dumb.

352
00:19:50.951 --> 00:19:52.119
Batman, buddy.

353
00:19:52.202 --> 00:19:54.288
Tell these guys how we saved Gotham.

354
00:19:54.997 --> 00:19:56.081
[hoarsely] Not this time.

355
00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:58.000
What do you mean, not this time.

356
00:19:58.876 --> 00:20:00.461
The league already has a plan.

357
00:20:00.586 --> 00:20:02.337
Frankly, you'd only be
getting in the way.

358
00:20:02.838 --> 00:20:04.548
Our friends are the ones in trouble.

359
00:20:04.882 --> 00:20:09.178
So, if we're in your way,
go ahead and move us.

360
00:20:09.678 --> 00:20:10.804

361

366

Diamagnetic repulsor.
[gasps] So cool.

367
00:20:29.406 --> 00:20:30.741
I may not be swinging fists,

368
00:20:30.824 --> 00:20:33.118
but I have no problem
restraining you in one.

369
00:20:33.702 --> 00:20:34.578
I'm gonna disagree,

370
00:20:34.787 --> 00:20:36.663
and say you have a pretty big problem.

371
00:20:39.083 --> 00:20:40.459
[Zatanna gushes]

372
00:20:40.542 --> 00:20:41.460
So, uh,

373
00:20:41.543 --> 00:20:42.753
shouldn't we be fighting?

374
00:20:42.836 --> 00:20:44.338
Feel like we're just kinda
standing here.

375
00:20:44.797 --> 00:20:46.423
Oh, [clears throat]
I don't care.

376
00:20:46.673 --> 00:20:47.674
I'm up for whatever.

377
00:20:47.883 --> 00:20:48.842
What do you feel like?

378
00:20:50.761 --> 00:20:51.804
[Supergirl grunts]

379
00:20:52.054 --> 00:20:53.222
Kara, stay down.

380
00:20:53.639 --> 00:20:55.391
[sighs] Can't you see
I'm trying to protect you?

381
00:20:55.474 --> 00:20:56.558
[Kara groans]

382
00:20:57.017 --> 00:20:59.269
Do we look like we need protecting?

383
00:20:59.645 --> 00:21:00.771
[grunts]

384
00:21:02.815 --> 00:21:04.441
[both grunting]

385
00:21:06.652 --> 00:21:07.653
Enough!

386
00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:13.200
Woohoo, you guys are in trouble now.

387
00:21:13.784 --> 00:21:14.618
Superman,

388
00:21:14.702 --> 00:21:15.786
you say you have a plan

389
00:21:15.869 --> 00:21:18.038
stop the Legion of Doom
and free our friends?

390
00:21:18.205 --> 00:21:19.206
Yes.

391
00:21:19.289 --> 00:21:20.541
What about Cythonna?

392
00:21:20.874 --> 00:21:22.668
There is no Cythonna, Kara.

393
00:21:23.043 --> 00:21:25.212
The ancient science
that amulet uses may be deadly.

394
00:21:25.462 --> 00:21:26.630
But it's just another weapon.

395
00:21:26.964 --> 00:21:29.258
Once it's out of the wrong
hands, it's harmless.

396
00:21:29.341 --> 00:21:31.093
And you are confident in your plan?

397
00:21:31.176 --> 00:21:32.136
What do you think?

398
00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.514
[dramatic music playing]

399
00:21:39.601 --> 00:21:41.395
We shall defer to the Justice League.

400

[all gasp]

401
00:21:44.481 --> 00:21:47.192
[suspenseful music playing]

402
00:21:49.153 --> 00:21:50.612
[Supergirl] Are you kidding me?

403
00:21:50.696 --> 00:21:51.864
[girls groan]

404
00:21:56.201 --> 00:21:57.828
Ooh! I can't wait till those

405
00:21:57.911 --> 00:21:59.621
Super Hero Girls show their faces.

406
00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:03.167
And we send them to limbo for eternity.

407
00:22:03.417 --> 00:22:04.835
[all cackling]

408
00:22:06.587 --> 00:22:08.714
Yeah, but since it's eternity,

409
00:22:08.797 --> 00:22:09.757
we got time.

410
00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.633
I mean, it's not like
we have to send them

411
00:22:11.717 --> 00:22:13.010
to limbo today.

412
00:22:13.677 --> 00:22:15.471
[Poison Ivy laughing]

413
00:22:21.018 --> 00:22:22.895
You must be so proud.

414
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:24.772
As their confidence grows,

415
00:22:24.855 --> 00:22:26.398
so does their malevolence.

416
00:22:27.649 --> 00:22:29.151
Have you forgotten, Cythonna?

417
00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:31.612
You are a silent partner.

418
00:22:31.695 --> 00:22:32.529
[Cythonna scoffs]

419
00:22:32.613 --> 00:22:36.116
Of course not. I appear to only you,
in this astral form.

420
00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.368
[Lex Luthor shudders]

421
00:22:37.451 --> 00:22:38.619
Albeit, weakly,

422
00:22:38.911 --> 00:22:40.829
for, as you know,

423
00:22:40.913 --> 00:22:42.456
my powers are limited

424
00:22:42.664 --> 00:22:43.916
while I remain trapped

425
00:22:43.999 --> 00:22:47.211
within this cursed prison forever.

426
00:22:47.711 --> 00:22:48.670
It's not all bad.

427
00:22:48.879 --> 00:22:49.755
Possessing your prison

428
00:22:49.838 --> 00:22:51.924
grants me access to that limited power.

429
00:22:52.007 --> 00:22:53.092
In return,

430
00:22:53.342 --> 00:22:54.385
I only ask--

431
00:22:54.468 --> 00:22:55.636
Oh, I know what you want.

432
00:22:55.719 --> 00:22:57.554
And perhaps once I,
Lex Luther, am victorious,

433
00:22:57.638 --> 00:22:58.764
I will indulge you.

434
00:22:59.765 --> 00:23:00.766
If I'm in a good mood.

435
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:04.478
You haven't begun to know what I want.

436
00:23:04.561 --> 00:23:07.231
[mysterious music playing]

437
00:23:07.439 --> 00:23:09.775
[Supergirl] <i>We're gonna defer</i>
<i>to the league?</i>

438
00:23:09.858 --> 00:23:10.943
Okay, I'll admit,

439
00:23:11.026 --> 00:23:12.444
I don't know what defer means,

440
00:23:12.653 --> 00:23:13.904
but I'm pretty sure you told him,

441
00:23:13.987 --> 00:23:15.197
we just roll over.

442
00:23:15.989 --> 00:23:18.659
Since when do we back down from a fight?

443
00:23:18.909 --> 00:23:21.036
-Are you afraid--
-I am an Amazon!

444
00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.663
I fear no fight.

445
00:23:24.289 --> 00:23:25.124
Kara,

446
00:23:25.207 --> 00:23:28.001
your will is the strongest
of any warrior I have known.

447
00:23:28.168 --> 00:23:30.337
And while that is part
of what makes you so mighty,

448
00:23:30.421 --> 00:23:32.172
it can also make you vulnerable

449
00:23:32.256 --> 00:23:33.966
when you allow it to become
bullheadedness.

450
00:23:34.049 --> 00:23:35.884
This brings me no pleasure either.

451
00:23:36.343 --> 00:23:37.928
But you chose me as your leader,

452
00:23:38.011 --> 00:23:39.555
not to make popular decisions.

453
00:23:39.638 --> 00:23:40.681
But the tough ones.

454
00:23:40.764 --> 00:23:42.933
And what if the League
blows it? Then what, huh?

455
00:23:43.016 --> 00:23:46.019
We left our only clue to stopping
anything at the North Pole.

456
00:23:46.103 --> 00:23:46.937
[doorbell chiming]

457
00:23:47.563 --> 00:23:48.731
[sighs wearily]

458
00:23:48.814 --> 00:23:50.107
[cell phone ringing]

459
00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:55.487
Ugh.

460
00:23:55.946 --> 00:23:57.030
[Supergirl grunts]

461
00:23:57.406 --> 00:23:58.240
Say, Kara,

462
00:23:58.323 --> 00:24:01.160
what was that about leaving
our only clue at the North Pole?

463
00:24:01.243 --> 00:24:04.246
You swiped my cousin's data crystals.

464
00:24:05.247 --> 00:24:06.373
[laughs]

465
00:24:07.041 --> 00:24:09.251
[euphoric music playing]

466
00:24:10.878 --> 00:24:12.337
[Superman] Bet your friends
are mad at you, huh?

467
00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.506
[Diana] Superman?

468
00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:15.883
This was from you?

469
00:24:15.966 --> 00:24:17.134
From him, actually.

470
00:24:17.676 --> 00:24:19.303
[mutters indistinctly]

471
00:24:19.386 --> 00:24:20.554
Join you!

472
00:24:20.637 --> 00:24:22.973
I am sorry, but I already belong
to a team.

473
00:24:23.265 --> 00:24:24.558
A team you dismissed!

474
00:24:24.641 --> 00:24:26.143
Look, I don't know you well,

475
00:24:26.393 --> 00:24:27.561
but I do know you'd never back down

476
00:24:27.644 --> 00:24:29.229
from a fight against evil.

477
00:24:29.313 --> 00:24:30.814
The only reason you stepped aside

478
00:24:30.898 --> 00:24:31.940
was to protect them.

479
00:24:32.232 --> 00:24:33.776
Because, at the end of the day,

480
00:24:34.193 --> 00:24:35.235
they are just kids.

481
00:24:35.319 --> 00:24:36.695
[mutters indistinctly]

482
00:24:36.779 --> 00:24:39.198
And how exactly am I different, Batman?

483
00:24:43.702 --> 00:24:44.870
[Superman] You're no kid.

484
00:24:44.953 --> 00:24:47.081
You got more combat expertise
than any of us.

485
00:24:47.581 --> 00:24:49.541
I have sworn to protect this world.

486
00:24:49.708 --> 00:24:51.585
And to stand up to any threat.

487
00:24:51.919 --> 00:24:52.961
But-- [sighs]

488
00:24:53.754 --> 00:24:55.631
But you're worried about
dissing your friends?

489
00:24:55.714 --> 00:24:57.132
This is bigger than that, Diana.

490
00:24:57.299 --> 00:24:58.175
If Luthor wins,

491
00:24:58.258 --> 00:25:00.135
a lot more than feelings
are gonna get hurt.

Uh, Kara,

00:25:12.773 --> 00:25:14.942
I know this is like a piece
from your lost planet.

498
00:25:15.067 --> 00:25:17.903
So, please don't take this
the wrong way, but, snore.

499
00:25:18.612 --> 00:25:19.863
Zee, don't be rude!

[machine whirring]

501
00:25:21.323 --> 00:25:22.825
But can we just skip
to the part about the amulet?

[Jessica slurping]

503
00:25:24.535 --> 00:25:27.538
And for such
a technologically-advanced society,

00:26:21.717 --> 00:26:22.551
[slams machine]

524
00:26:22.634 --> 00:26:24.178
Lead flash fryer and tomato slicer

525
00:26:24.261 --> 00:26:26.055
at Krypton's number one
fast food chain--

526
00:26:26.138 --> 00:26:27.097
[Supergirl shushes] Here it is.

527
00:26:28.015 --> 00:26:30.184
<i>Long believed to be merely a relic</i>

528
00:26:30.267 --> 00:26:31.643
<i>from a lost science,</i>

529
00:26:32.019 --> 00:26:34.271
<i>the Amulet of Cythonna is, in fact,</i>

530
00:26:34.646 --> 00:26:36.190
<i>something far more sinister.</i>

531
00:26:36.899 --> 00:26:39.109
<i>For as impossible as it may seem,</i>

532
00:26:39.193 --> 00:26:40.652
<i>the crystal within</i>

533
00:26:40.986 --> 00:26:42.404
<i>does, in fact, contain</i>

534
00:26:42.738 --> 00:26:46.116
<i>the essence of the Goddess of Darkness.</i>

535
00:26:46.658 --> 00:26:47.659
Wait...

536
00:26:47.868 --> 00:26:49.453
The actual goddess?

537
00:26:49.536 --> 00:26:50.454
<i>For eons,</i>

538
00:26:50.704 --> 00:26:51.997
<i>the imprisoned Cythonna</i>

539
00:26:52.081 --> 00:26:53.665
<i>has floated through the cosmos,</i>

540
00:26:53.749 --> 00:26:55.501
<i>in search of the one thing</i>

541
00:26:55.793 --> 00:26:57.211
<i>that may free her.</i>

542
00:26:57.294 --> 00:26:58.295
<i>Evil!</i>

543
00:26:58.879 --> 00:27:00.672
<i>She feeds on the souls</i>

544
00:27:00.756 --> 00:27:01.840
<i>of the wicked.</i>

545
00:27:01.924 --> 00:27:03.675
Like Luthor and the Legion of Doom.

546
00:27:03.842 --> 00:27:06.553
<i>The souls will become her servants</i>

547
00:27:06.762 --> 00:27:07.805
<i>and, in turn,</i>

548
00:27:08.263 --> 00:27:10.891
<i>create more evil for her to devour.</i>

549
00:27:12.017 --> 00:27:12.935
Ooh, I get it.

550
00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:14.436
Luthor isn't using Cythonna.

551
00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:15.979
She's using him.

552
00:27:16.522 --> 00:27:17.689
That's actually way worse.

553
00:27:17.773 --> 00:27:19.733
<i>Once she has become strong enough,</i>

554
00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:22.486
<i>-she will free herself from her prison.</i>
-[crystal shattering]

555
00:27:22.569 --> 00:27:23.654
-[all gasp]
<i>-She will assume</i>

556
00:27:23.737 --> 00:27:26.031
<i>a new Kryptonian vessel</i>

557
00:27:26.115 --> 00:27:28.075
<i>and reclaim the universe</i>

558
00:27:28.283 --> 00:27:29.535
<i>as her dominion.</i>

559
00:27:31.704 --> 00:27:34.707
The League has totally underestimated
what they're up against.

560
00:27:35.791 --> 00:27:37.793
[gasps] We have to warn Aquaman.

561
00:27:37.876 --> 00:27:39.128
I mean, the League.

562
00:27:39.253 --> 00:27:40.129
We have to warn the League.

563
00:27:40.713 --> 00:27:41.672
I'll call Diana.

564
00:27:42.381 --> 00:27:43.257
Kara, what do you think

565
00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:45.801
your uncle meant by
"a new Kryptonian vessel"?

566
00:27:46.385 --> 00:27:47.553
I don't know.

567
00:27:47.803 --> 00:27:49.763
Well, I guess we could listen
to some more of my uncle--

568
00:27:49.888 --> 00:27:51.348
-[Jessica] I was just curious.
-No way.

569
00:27:51.515 --> 00:27:52.725
[Batgirl] Guys.

570
00:27:52.808 --> 00:27:54.017
Diana's not answering.

571
00:27:56.937 --> 00:27:58.105
Hey, what's going on?

572
00:27:58.188 --> 00:28:00.190
I thought this was
supposed to be a crossover.

573
00:28:00.274 --> 00:28:01.608
Not that I'm complaining,

574
00:28:01.692 --> 00:28:03.736
but we haven't done anything here.

575
00:28:03.819 --> 00:28:05.571
While I am enjoying the escapades

576
00:28:05.654 --> 00:28:08.157
of the heroes
that are both girls and super,

577
00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.952
I do not see any evidence
of the crossing or the over.

578
00:28:12.036 --> 00:28:14.580
Yeah, and what's the big deal
about this crossover anyway?

579
00:28:14.663 --> 00:28:17.166
We already met the Super Hero Girls
a bunch of times.

580
00:28:17.249 --> 00:28:19.251
Youse were even there
one time, you remembers?

581
00:28:19.334 --> 00:28:21.253
That was on your show, you clowns.

582
00:28:21.503 --> 00:28:24.339
And while your show plays fast
and loose with internal logic,

583
00:28:24.423 --> 00:28:26.091
throws continuity out its window,

584
00:28:26.175 --> 00:28:29.261
and chooses poop jokes
over actual story,

585
00:28:29.553 --> 00:28:32.514
their show maintains
a coherent, cohesive narrative.

586
00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:35.142
Yeah, but how are their ratings?

587
00:28:35.851 --> 00:28:38.312
-Meh.
-[gasps] Wait a minute.

588
00:28:38.562 --> 00:28:39.396
That's it.

589
00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.607
We're not glomming onto
their popularity.

590
00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:43.150
They're glomming on to ours.

591
00:28:43.233 --> 00:28:44.151
[all gasp]

592
00:28:44.234 --> 00:28:46.278
I's, I's don't knows what to says.

593
00:28:46.528 --> 00:28:47.613
I feel so,

594
00:28:47.863 --> 00:28:49.531
so used right now.

595
00:28:50.199 --> 00:28:51.033
Indeed.

596
00:28:51.116 --> 00:28:52.993
Much like the bauble
that Beast Boy for used

597
00:28:53.077 --> 00:28:54.495
for the propping up of the TV.

598
00:28:54.578 --> 00:28:56.747
I too am feeling wedged into something,

599
00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:58.415
to which I do not belong.

600
00:28:58.499 --> 00:29:01.502
With the assigned, expressed
purpose of holding it up.

601
00:29:02.503 --> 00:29:04.380
This stinks, Control Freak.

602
00:29:04.463 --> 00:29:06.090
Oh, come now, Robin.

603
00:29:06.173 --> 00:29:07.216
I thought you'd be flattered

604
00:29:07.299 --> 00:29:08.884
by how much they think of your funny,

605
00:29:08.967 --> 00:29:11.136
action-packed, popular show.

606
00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.430
Oh. Well, you flatter us.

607
00:29:13.514 --> 00:29:15.265
It is pretty-- Hey!

608
00:29:15.432 --> 00:29:17.101
You can't blow me off with compliments.

609
00:29:17.184 --> 00:29:19.311
Yeah. I mean, if you don't
give us this event,

610
00:29:19.436 --> 00:29:20.687
at least you can give us something.

611
00:29:20.771 --> 00:29:22.106
Like a song, yo.

612
00:29:22.314 --> 00:29:23.440
Break it down, Cy.

613
00:29:24.274 --> 00:29:27.194
<i>You say you got us</i>
<i>In this crossover thang</i>

614
00:29:28.987 --> 00:29:30.781
<i>But this ain't how it's supposed to go</i>

615
00:29:30.948 --> 00:29:33.033
<i>It ain't supposed to be like this, y'all</i>

616
00:29:34.034 --> 00:29:36.245
<i>Where's the part where we</i>
<i>Meet the other team</i>

617
00:29:36.328 --> 00:29:38.163
<i>And then laughing</i>

618
00:29:38.831 --> 00:29:40.582
<i>And the dumb misunderstandings</i>

619
00:29:40.666 --> 00:29:43.502
<i>-That bring us to blows</i>
<i>-Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

620
00:29:43.585 --> 00:29:45.963
<i>-Don't crossover my heart</i>
<i>-Don't do it</i>

621
00:29:46.046 --> 00:29:48.257
<i>Don't crossover my heart</i>

622
00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:50.134
<i>We must find the compare and contrast</i>

623
00:29:50.217 --> 00:29:52.886
<i>-To our counterparts</i>
<i>-Yeah</i>

624
00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:55.431
<i>Don't forget the obligatory romance</i>

625
00:29:55.514 --> 00:29:57.641
<i>-Between two crossed hearts</i>
<i>-Don't push it, Rob</i>

626
00:29:57.975 --> 00:30:00.310
<i>Don't crossover my heart</i>

627
00:30:00.394 --> 00:30:02.187
<i>Don't crossover</i>

628
00:30:02.271 --> 00:30:03.188
[Control Freak screams] Stop!

629
00:30:03.856 --> 00:30:06.108
And you wonder why you're not
featured in this event more.

630
00:30:06.191 --> 00:30:07.234
[scoffs]

631
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:14.158
My trap has been set.

632
00:30:14.783 --> 00:30:16.660
Any remaining heroes
who oppose me will be crushed.

633
00:30:17.286 --> 00:30:18.829
But what of the Kryptonian?

634
00:30:19.747 --> 00:30:22.082
Look, I haven't forgotten your request.

635
00:30:23.459 --> 00:30:25.836
Perhaps I'll honor it. If it suits me.

636
00:30:26.003 --> 00:30:28.839
[dramatic music playing]

637
00:30:28.922 --> 00:30:30.466
And it does suit me.

638
00:30:30.883 --> 00:30:32.801
The Kryptonian you require
will arrive shortly.

639
00:30:36.889 --> 00:30:38.182
[cracks]

640
00:30:39.808 --> 00:30:44.063
The Legion's evil is making me stronger
by the second.

641
00:30:44.146 --> 00:30:46.065
Soon, I shall be free.

642
00:30:49.902 --> 00:30:51.945
I don't see any sign of Diana up here.

643
00:30:52.821 --> 00:30:54.573
I'm coming up empty too.

644
00:30:54.907 --> 00:30:56.367
Ugh, we better regroup.

645
00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:58.744
So the last any of us heard from her was

646
00:30:58.827 --> 00:31:00.245
that group text from an hour ago.

647
00:31:01.246 --> 00:31:02.081
Right!

648
00:31:02.164 --> 00:31:03.624
The one that just said, "I'm in"?

649
00:31:03.791 --> 00:31:05.334
Yeah, but in what?

650
00:31:05.793 --> 00:31:07.044
Actually, looking at this again,

651
00:31:07.127 --> 00:31:08.796
I think the real question might be,

652
00:31:09.505 --> 00:31:12.591
who are all these other numbers
she included on that text?

653
00:31:12.674 --> 00:31:15.260
I just assumed it was another one
of Diana's tech goofs,

654
00:31:15.344 --> 00:31:17.554
because I don't
recognize any of the numbers.

655
00:31:17.638 --> 00:31:18.597
[Supergirl] I do.

656
00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:19.848
This is Clark's.

657
00:31:20.015 --> 00:31:22.184
And this one comes up as Jon Stewart.

658
00:31:24.395 --> 00:31:26.271
Batman's emergency line is here too.

659
00:31:27.689 --> 00:31:29.942
So, maybe including these other numbers

660
00:31:30.317 --> 00:31:31.485
wasn't a mistake.

661
00:31:31.777 --> 00:31:34.238
But including ours was.

662
00:31:35.364 --> 00:31:37.282
And when Diana said "I'm in",

663
00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:38.534
she meant...

664
00:31:38.617 --> 00:31:40.160
In the Justice League.

665
00:31:42.204 --> 00:31:43.288
Just curious.

666
00:31:43.372 --> 00:31:44.748
That would make this last number

667
00:31:44.832 --> 00:31:46.041
Aquaman's, right? [giggles]

668
00:31:48.877 --> 00:31:50.838
[dramatic music playing]

669
00:31:50.921 --> 00:31:53.882
Batman's traced the amulet's radiation
signature to this swamp.

670
00:31:53.966 --> 00:31:55.592
<i>We should be closing in</i>
<i>on the Legion's headquarters</i>

671
00:31:55.676 --> 00:31:56.593
<i>any second now.</i>

672
00:31:56.927 --> 00:31:58.846
Ah, about time, man.

673
00:31:58.929 --> 00:32:00.305
That dude can build anything
with that ring.

674
00:32:00.389 --> 00:32:02.641
Try a little lumbar support
next time. Am I right?

675
00:32:04.643 --> 00:32:06.437
Oh, okay. Another serious one, huh?

676
00:32:06.603 --> 00:32:07.479
I am sorry?

677
00:32:07.563 --> 00:32:08.772
No, no, it's cool.

678
00:32:08.856 --> 00:32:11.442
Just between Sergeant Green-never-grin,

679
00:32:11.525 --> 00:32:13.610
Dracula man and the Ego Scout,

680
00:32:13.694 --> 00:32:16.155
[whispering] this team's got
the personality of a sea sponge.

681
00:32:17.114 --> 00:32:19.658
I do not know this
Sergeant Green-never grin.

682
00:32:20.743 --> 00:32:22.619
[chuckles] All right.

683
00:32:22.745 --> 00:32:25.080
Well, none of these guys
has a sense of humor.

684
00:32:25.289 --> 00:32:27.207
[Superman over radio] <i>All right, team.</i>
<i>Let's go over the plan.</i>

685
00:32:27.374 --> 00:32:29.043
Superman will lead the direct strike.

686
00:32:29.168 --> 00:32:30.878
While Batman uses the distraction

687
00:32:30.961 --> 00:32:32.504
to sneak in and steal the amulet.

688
00:32:32.713 --> 00:32:36.175
[muttering]

689
00:32:37.551 --> 00:32:38.385
I'm gonna be honest here,

690
00:32:38.469 --> 00:32:40.387
I am not completely sure
what he just said,

691
00:32:40.471 --> 00:32:42.097
but I think it had something to do with

692
00:32:42.181 --> 00:32:44.433
using the amulet
to free the other dudes?

693
00:32:44.516 --> 00:32:45.809
[muttering]

694
00:32:45.893 --> 00:32:47.394
All right, and then destroy the amulet.

695
00:32:47.478 --> 00:32:48.645
[laughs] Right.

696
00:32:48.729 --> 00:32:49.980
Is it just me, or is anyone else

697
00:32:50.064 --> 00:32:51.398
having trouble understanding
the bat guy?

698
00:32:51.607 --> 00:32:53.192
'Cause I'd be surprised
if it was just me

699
00:32:53.275 --> 00:32:54.943
'cause I can understand jellyfish.

700
00:32:55.527 --> 00:32:56.653
[Superman over the radio] <i>Got a visual.</i>

701
00:32:56.737 --> 00:32:58.614
[dramatic music playing]

702
00:33:00.574 --> 00:33:02.409
<i>And it looks like everyone's home.</i>

703
00:33:03.827 --> 00:33:05.287
[explosion]

704
00:33:05.537 --> 00:33:06.830
Game's over, Luthor.

705
00:33:19.802 --> 00:33:20.886
[shatters]

706
00:33:20.969 --> 00:33:22.346
Yep, it's a phony.

707
00:33:22.471 --> 00:33:24.390
Just something I whipped up
to get your attention.

708
00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.683
I call it a trans-thermal transmitter,

709
00:33:26.767 --> 00:33:28.560
but you can call it a trap.

710
00:33:32.898 --> 00:33:34.066
[metal clanks]

711
00:33:35.359 --> 00:33:38.237
And you were
supposed to be the smart one.

712
00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.196
All right, team.

713
00:33:40.239 --> 00:33:42.241
[dramatic music playing]

714
00:33:42.366 --> 00:33:43.367
This shouldn't take long.

715
00:33:45.077 --> 00:33:46.036
[grunts]

716
00:33:50.374 --> 00:33:51.208
Huh?

717
00:33:54.378 --> 00:33:56.463
-[Wonder Woman grunts]
-[growling]

718
00:33:56.588 --> 00:33:57.589
Uh.

719
00:34:00.467 --> 00:34:03.637
[suspenseful music playing]

720
00:34:04.304 --> 00:34:05.139
[Diana] Huh?

721
00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:07.307
Holograms?

722
00:34:07.725 --> 00:34:09.309
-What have you--
-[Superman] Okay, be cool.

723
00:34:09.393 --> 00:34:11.395
We may have walked into--
[grunts]

724
00:34:15.899 --> 00:34:16.900
Whatever that thing is,

725
00:34:16.984 --> 00:34:18.360
-it's made of--
-[Luthor] Kryptonite.

726
00:34:22.156 --> 00:34:23.615
[cackling]

727
00:34:28.037 --> 00:34:29.913
I have what I need. Dispose of the rest.

728
00:34:32.374 --> 00:34:33.709
Stand strong, League!

729
00:34:50.642 --> 00:34:51.602
Hey!

730
00:34:51.685 --> 00:34:52.811
That's not cool, man.

731
00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:00.235
So not cool, man.

732
00:35:05.365 --> 00:35:08.160
[giggling] Where are your
little friends?

733
00:35:08.452 --> 00:35:10.412
This won't be the same without them.

734
00:35:10.496 --> 00:35:12.206
They're no threat to us now.

735
00:35:12.289 --> 00:35:15.542
Especially without their
precious captain.

736
00:35:16.168 --> 00:35:19.046
Hold up! This one's mine.

737
00:35:19.129 --> 00:35:20.631
[both grunting]

738
00:35:20.964 --> 00:35:23.008
[grunts] Harley Quinn?

739
00:35:23.175 --> 00:35:25.594
-I will not spare--
-Ah, zip it would ya?

740
00:35:25.761 --> 00:35:27.346
-[grunts]
-[Diana] What is this?

741
00:35:27.429 --> 00:35:28.931
-[hinges creaking]
-[exhales]

742
00:35:29.056 --> 00:35:30.682
These guys are out of control,

743
00:35:30.766 --> 00:35:32.518
and they're getting eviler
by the second.

744
00:35:32.601 --> 00:35:34.186
You need to get Babs
and your pals together

745
00:35:34.269 --> 00:35:35.270
and save the day,

746
00:35:35.354 --> 00:35:37.231
like you jerks always do.

747
00:35:38.482 --> 00:35:41.235
Harleen, I am afraid that is unlikely.

748
00:35:41.402 --> 00:35:42.569
For you see, I have--

749
00:35:42.653 --> 00:35:45.739
Ain't that something. I don't care, go.

750
00:35:46.281 --> 00:35:47.783
-But--
-[door slams]

751
00:35:48.158 --> 00:35:50.828
Uh... Ra-koom!

752
00:35:53.914 --> 00:35:57.334
Uh, welp, add another one
to the old Phantom Zone.

753
00:35:57.876 --> 00:35:59.878
[exclaims]

754
00:36:07.886 --> 00:36:11.682
So, I take it things aren't
going well on the other side.

755
00:36:13.183 --> 00:36:14.393
I can't believe the Legion of Doom

756
00:36:14.476 --> 00:36:16.311
took out a team
of heavy hitters like you.

757
00:36:16.437 --> 00:36:17.855
I can't believe you formed your own team

758
00:36:17.938 --> 00:36:20.065
and didn't call it, "Super Friends."

759
00:36:20.149 --> 00:36:21.525
[scoffs] Told you.

760
00:36:21.608 --> 00:36:24.653
And I can't believe
you didn't ask Hal Jordan

761
00:36:24.737 --> 00:36:27.156
to be your Green Lantern. I mean, Jon,

762
00:36:27.281 --> 00:36:28.866
you're cool and all, but...

763
00:36:30.451 --> 00:36:31.994
[whines] Come on!

764
00:36:33.037 --> 00:36:34.955
Hal Jordan!

765
00:36:35.664 --> 00:36:37.166
Unbelievable.

766
00:36:37.249 --> 00:36:38.625
She sold us out.

767
00:36:38.709 --> 00:36:40.502
Look, we're all mad at Diana,

768
00:36:40.586 --> 00:36:42.588
but we have to trust her decision.

769
00:36:42.713 --> 00:36:43.881
Tell 'em, Jess.

770
00:36:43.964 --> 00:36:47.301
Honestly, right now, I don't know.

771
00:36:47.384 --> 00:36:49.970
All my life, people have been
selling me short.

772
00:36:50.137 --> 00:36:52.097
But, Diana?

773
00:36:52.181 --> 00:36:54.892
I'm sure she's got
the team's best interests at heart.

774
00:36:54.975 --> 00:36:56.435
Face it, Babs.

775
00:36:56.518 --> 00:36:57.770
She dumped us.

776
00:36:59.229 --> 00:37:01.690
No, she loves us more than anything.

777
00:37:01.774 --> 00:37:03.025
I mean, after what she went through,

778
00:37:03.108 --> 00:37:04.401
with me and Harley Quinn alone...

779
00:37:04.568 --> 00:37:06.028
[grunting]

780
00:37:06.528 --> 00:37:08.530
What about you and Harley?

781
00:37:09.031 --> 00:37:10.949
Oh, did I not mention

782
00:37:11.033 --> 00:37:12.743
Harley Quinn and Harleen Quinzel

783
00:37:12.826 --> 00:37:14.370
are actually one in the same?

784
00:37:14.578 --> 00:37:16.163
I mean, saying the names together,

785
00:37:16.246 --> 00:37:18.040
it's kind of obvious,
so you probably already

786
00:37:18.123 --> 00:37:19.625
figured it out. Right?

787
00:37:19.792 --> 00:37:21.752
You and Diana knew

788
00:37:21.835 --> 00:37:24.463
your bestie was a super villain
and you didn't tell us?

789
00:37:24.546 --> 00:37:26.965
Technically, ex-bestie.

790
00:37:27.216 --> 00:37:29.760
She threw me off a train, Barbara!

791
00:37:30.886 --> 00:37:33.180
-[Jessica] Zee?
-[gasps]

792
00:37:34.014 --> 00:37:36.392
Babs, I... [sighs]

793
00:37:36.475 --> 00:37:37.476
Forget it.

794
00:37:37.684 --> 00:37:38.894
I quit.

795
00:37:39.603 --> 00:37:41.105
Yup, me too.

796
00:37:42.147 --> 00:37:43.315
What do we do?

797
00:37:43.399 --> 00:37:44.775
What is there to do?

798
00:37:44.858 --> 00:37:46.860
The League is handling the bad guys,

799
00:37:47.611 --> 00:37:49.571
so, I guess...

800
00:37:50.656 --> 00:37:51.865
We go home.

801
00:37:56.912 --> 00:37:59.289
<i>Good evening. Lex Luthor here.</i>

802
00:37:59.373 --> 00:38:01.208
<i>You know me</i>
<i>as the entrepreneurial genius</i>

803
00:38:01.291 --> 00:38:02.626
<i>who built a billion-dollar empire</i>

804
00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:03.544
<i>with nothing more than his</i>

805
00:38:03.627 --> 00:38:06.046
<i>preternatural savvy</i>
<i>and indomitable drive.</i>

806
00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:08.424
Today, I am allowing
these gifts to serve

807
00:38:08.507 --> 00:38:09.967
a much higher purpose.

808
00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:12.761
But first, I'd like to introduce
you to some friends of mine.

809
00:38:13.512 --> 00:38:15.723
The Legion of Doom.

810
00:38:16.849 --> 00:38:18.183
[all gasping]

811
00:38:18.267 --> 00:38:19.184
<i>I know, I know.</i>

812
00:38:19.268 --> 00:38:20.686
<i>Pretty cool name. Am I right?</i>

813
00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:23.063
Anyway, about my new higher purpose.

814
00:38:23.522 --> 00:38:24.648
I, Lex Luthor

815
00:38:24.732 --> 00:38:26.150
<i>and my Legion of Doom,</i>

816
00:38:26.358 --> 00:38:29.027
<i>are going to take over the world.</i>

817
00:38:30.362 --> 00:38:32.197
<i>You're saying, "Come on, Lex.</i>

818
00:38:32.281 --> 00:38:33.991
<i>How are you going</i>
<i>to take over the world?"</i>

819
00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:35.367
<i>Simple.</i>

820
00:38:37.453 --> 00:38:38.954
<i>You're gonna give it to us.</i>

821
00:38:39.246 --> 00:38:41.290
<i>Cast your eyes skyward, folks.</i>

822
00:38:41.373 --> 00:38:44.084
[machine whirring]

823
00:38:47.463 --> 00:38:50.299
All right, Cythonna,
show us what you can really do.

824
00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:02.895
[people murmuring]

825
00:39:05.814 --> 00:39:08.067
<i>So, this is when I say,</i>

826
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:10.527
<i>you have 24 hours to meet our demands.</i>

827
00:39:10.652 --> 00:39:11.695
[crowd gasping]

828
00:39:12.196 --> 00:39:14.114
Oh, my gosh. I forgot the best part.

829
00:39:14.364 --> 00:39:16.367
Don't look for any clowns in tights
to save you.

830
00:39:16.533 --> 00:39:17.743
We've gotten rid of them all.

831
00:39:18.243 --> 00:39:19.995
Well, the important ones, anyway.

832
00:39:20.371 --> 00:39:21.955
[all laughing]

833
00:39:22.039 --> 00:39:24.708
You now have 23 hours and 59 minutes.

834
00:39:30.464 --> 00:39:33.133
Since when you become
the brooding type of bat?

835
00:39:33.217 --> 00:39:35.427
[growls] You picked the wrong time
to mess with...

836
00:39:35.677 --> 00:39:36.637
Harleen?

837
00:39:36.804 --> 00:39:38.597
-Where is the...
-Jester get-up?

838
00:39:38.722 --> 00:39:40.182
Ah, taking a break.

839
00:39:40.641 --> 00:39:44.103
Turns out I'm a big fan
of causing chaos,

840
00:39:44.311 --> 00:39:45.979
but destroying the world?

841
00:39:46.063 --> 00:39:47.564
Eh, not so much.

842
00:39:47.815 --> 00:39:49.066
You quit the Legion?

843
00:39:49.691 --> 00:39:51.735
Does this mean
you're not a bad guy anymore?

844
00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:54.363
Let's just say, I'm taking a sabbatical.

845
00:39:54.613 --> 00:39:55.489
Really?

846
00:39:56.198 --> 00:39:58.242
Well, you couldn't have
quit at a better time.

847
00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:01.120
A group of A-list heroes like
Wonder Woman is about to kick their...

848
00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:02.287
What?

849
00:40:02.371 --> 00:40:03.914
You don't know, do you?

850
00:40:03.997 --> 00:40:04.873
Know what?

851
00:40:04.957 --> 00:40:07.710
Eesh, Babs! Current events much?

852
00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:09.378
[cell phone ringing]

853
00:40:10.546 --> 00:40:13.090
[Karen] <i>Babs, emergency</i>
<i>at the junkyard. Hurry!</i>

854
00:40:18.053 --> 00:40:19.513
Bumblebee, I'm here.

855
00:40:19.638 --> 00:40:20.681
Where are you?

856
00:40:20.764 --> 00:40:22.182
Bumblebee, are you okay?

857
00:40:25.227 --> 00:40:26.395
Hmph!

858
00:40:27.354 --> 00:40:28.981
You got Bumblebee's distress call too?

859
00:40:29.106 --> 00:40:30.357
[sighs] Harley Quinn.

860
00:40:30.941 --> 00:40:32.359
What did you do with her?

861
00:40:32.443 --> 00:40:34.236
Hold up, Zee. She's with me.

862
00:40:34.361 --> 00:40:36.697
And that changes what exactly, Babs?

863
00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:39.032
Whoa, easy! For once,

864
00:40:39.199 --> 00:40:41.410
this girl's not with anybody.

865
00:40:41.493 --> 00:40:43.245
Even less reason to trust you.

866
00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:44.705
Quit arguing!

867
00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:46.331
We've got to find Bumblebee.

868
00:40:46.415 --> 00:40:47.541
[Bumblebee] I'm right here.

869
00:40:47.624 --> 00:40:49.251
I faked an emergency call.

870
00:40:49.334 --> 00:40:51.086
-Wait. What?
-[Zatanna] So not cool.

871
00:40:51.378 --> 00:40:53.630
Because we got to talk.

872
00:40:53.964 --> 00:40:54.882
Look.

873
00:40:54.965 --> 00:40:57.843
I know we have different ideas of what
being a superhero means,

874
00:40:57.926 --> 00:41:00.179
and honestly, that's what makes us...

875
00:41:00.637 --> 00:41:02.598
made us, such a good team.

876
00:41:03.932 --> 00:41:05.726
But what made us a great team

877
00:41:05.976 --> 00:41:07.019
is that we always agreed

878
00:41:07.102 --> 00:41:09.021
on the one thing a superhero isn't.

879
00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:10.647
Selfish.

880
00:41:14.193 --> 00:41:16.695
We've been putting our own issues
ahead of the greater good.

881
00:41:17.154 --> 00:41:19.656
Whether it's a big shadow
only you can see,

882
00:41:19.907 --> 00:41:22.368
or questioning the virtue
of someone you love,

883
00:41:22.576 --> 00:41:24.870
or questioning the virtue in yourself.

884
00:41:25.496 --> 00:41:27.081
Or maybe you're just afraid

885
00:41:27.164 --> 00:41:29.041
to tell your friends
to be quiet and listen

886
00:41:29.166 --> 00:41:30.793
when they're making a huge mistake.

887
00:41:31.335 --> 00:41:33.670
Well, it's time to get over ourselves.

888
00:41:33.921 --> 00:41:35.881
So, be quiet and listen!

889
00:41:36.882 --> 00:41:38.509
The League may have made a big mistake

890
00:41:38.634 --> 00:41:40.302
by underestimating the Legion of Doom.

891
00:41:40.594 --> 00:41:42.888
But by claiming victory
without even considering us,

892
00:41:43.097 --> 00:41:44.973
the bad guys made
an even bigger mistake.

893
00:41:45.557 --> 00:41:48.477
They underestimated
the Super Hero Girls.

894
00:41:48.644 --> 00:41:50.312
Time to kick some Legion butt.

895
00:41:50.396 --> 00:41:51.438
[all] Yeah.

896
00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:53.399
[Harley] A word of advice.

897
00:41:53.482 --> 00:41:55.526
If you're planning to storm
the Hall of Doom,

898
00:41:55.692 --> 00:41:56.944
bring hand towels.

899
00:41:57.194 --> 00:41:59.029
The restroom dryers are the pits!

900
00:41:59.571 --> 00:42:00.989
Wait. Harleen.

901
00:42:01.073 --> 00:42:02.241
You're not going to help?

902
00:42:02.408 --> 00:42:04.868
I said I didn't want
to destroy the world.

903
00:42:04.952 --> 00:42:07.246
Never said nothing about saving it.

904
00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:09.748
[sighs] Forget her.

905
00:42:09.873 --> 00:42:10.958
We got work to do.

906
00:42:11.166 --> 00:42:12.960
First, we got to get our leader back.

907
00:42:13.085 --> 00:42:14.503
Now, just a minute.

908
00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:16.171
She made a mistake, Kara.

909
00:42:16.255 --> 00:42:17.214
One mistake.

910
00:42:17.423 --> 00:42:19.717
How many of yours has she let slide?

911
00:42:21.301 --> 00:42:22.469
Let's go get her.

912
00:42:22.803 --> 00:42:25.139
But how? Isn't she in the Phantom Zone?

913
00:42:25.556 --> 00:42:26.432
Seriously?

914
00:42:26.515 --> 00:42:28.350
Have any of you been checking
your phones, at all?

915
00:42:28.434 --> 00:42:29.893
-We've had a lot going on.
-Lost my charger.

916
00:42:29.977 --> 00:42:31.729
Only to check the fashion month feed.

917
00:42:32.312 --> 00:42:33.147
[sighs]

918
00:42:36.066 --> 00:42:37.234
<i>My beloved sisters.</i>

919
00:42:37.776 --> 00:42:38.902
<i>I have wronged you.</i>

920
00:42:38.986 --> 00:42:41.321
I mean, it's cool she figured out
how to send a video,

921
00:42:41.405 --> 00:42:43.699
but you think she'd have realized
her thumb was covering the scree--

922
00:42:43.824 --> 00:42:45.200
Babs, listen.

923
00:42:45.826 --> 00:42:47.453
[sighs] <i>I know now,</i>

924
00:42:47.661 --> 00:42:49.163
<i>that in trying to protect you,</i>

925
00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:51.415
<i>I only hurt you, deeply.</i>

926
00:42:55.502 --> 00:42:56.879
And because of this failure,

927
00:42:57.046 --> 00:42:59.757
I have humbly returned
to Themyscira, Mother.

928
00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:02.051
There is a first for everything.

929
00:43:02.134 --> 00:43:04.803
You of all people know
this is not my first failure,

930
00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.598
but it is my greatest.

931
00:43:07.681 --> 00:43:10.059
I was referring to your tears.

932
00:43:10.142 --> 00:43:13.187
I cannot recall
ever seeing you cry, my child.

933
00:43:13.312 --> 00:43:14.146
[Diana grunts]

934
00:43:14.605 --> 00:43:17.524
As your mother,
I did everything in my power

935
00:43:17.608 --> 00:43:20.194
to ensure failure never befall you.

936
00:43:20.319 --> 00:43:22.029
I know, Mother. Thank you.

937
00:43:22.112 --> 00:43:25.491
However, the one lesson I never taught

938
00:43:25.574 --> 00:43:27.576
was what to do when it does.

939
00:43:28.285 --> 00:43:29.953
We all fail, Diana.

940
00:43:30.329 --> 00:43:31.997
And that was my failure.

941
00:43:32.247 --> 00:43:34.917
One we will now rectify.

942
00:43:35.167 --> 00:43:36.043
We?

943
00:43:36.168 --> 00:43:39.421
Lucky for you, we're all really familiar
with screwing up.

944
00:43:39.671 --> 00:43:42.132
Yeah, we can give you the crash course.

945
00:43:42.299 --> 00:43:43.425
[all shouting]

946
00:43:45.677 --> 00:43:47.513
[sighs] We'll take it from here, Poly.

947
00:43:49.431 --> 00:43:50.349
Sisters.

948
00:43:50.432 --> 00:43:52.226
You are here. I thought you...

949
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:53.227
Broke up?

950
00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:54.269
We did.

951
00:43:54.353 --> 00:43:56.480
But Karen had a really inspiring speech.

952
00:43:56.605 --> 00:43:58.315
Ooh, do the speech thing again, Karen.

953
00:43:58.399 --> 00:44:00.609
It was more of an in-the-moment thing.

954
00:44:00.734 --> 00:44:02.820
But we did watch your thumb apology.

955
00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:04.363
And thanks to Jess' ring,

956
00:44:04.488 --> 00:44:06.323
we got here a lot faster
than your row-boat.

957
00:44:06.573 --> 00:44:09.034
Now, come on.
There's no more time for hugs.

958
00:44:09.952 --> 00:44:12.121
Well, maybe one more.

959
00:44:12.204 --> 00:44:13.622
[all chuckling]

960
00:44:13.914 --> 00:44:15.249
All right. Diana,

961
00:44:15.416 --> 00:44:16.667
let's save the world.

962
00:44:16.834 --> 00:44:18.377
You still trust me to lead you?

963
00:44:18.961 --> 00:44:20.129
More than ever, D.

964
00:44:30.222 --> 00:44:31.640
With no other option,

965
00:44:31.932 --> 00:44:35.144
the United Council of Nations
cedes its power

966
00:44:35.352 --> 00:44:36.854
to the Legion of Doom.

967
00:44:36.979 --> 00:44:38.230
[all cheering]

968
00:44:40.399 --> 00:44:41.734
We make a good team.

969
00:44:41.817 --> 00:44:44.027
Not bad for a Kryptonian.

970
00:44:44.903 --> 00:44:45.988
What?

971
00:44:46.071 --> 00:44:48.615
I think we're past any delusions

972
00:44:48.741 --> 00:44:52.619
of this being an actual partnership,
aren't we, Alexander?

973
00:44:52.995 --> 00:44:54.288
[sighs] What on earth are you...

974
00:44:54.371 --> 00:44:55.539
Stop talking.

975
00:44:58.751 --> 00:45:01.837
With my power near its peak,
it's time you assume the role

976
00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.173
I'd always intended for you
and your Legion.

977
00:45:04.673 --> 00:45:05.883
Servitude.

978
00:45:06.508 --> 00:45:08.302
I await your command, Cythonna.

979
00:45:08.886 --> 00:45:10.220
Funny thing is,

980
00:45:10.387 --> 00:45:14.224
you've been serving me since the moment
you touched my amulet.

981
00:45:14.308 --> 00:45:18.437
You were just too blinded by your own
greed and ambition to realize it.

982
00:45:19.021 --> 00:45:19.855
So blind.

983
00:45:20.355 --> 00:45:21.732
What will you have me do?

984
00:45:22.024 --> 00:45:24.109
Ugh! I shall soon be free.

985
00:45:24.401 --> 00:45:26.612
I want to see my new Kryptonian body.

986
00:45:36.914 --> 00:45:38.290
What was that?

987
00:45:38.374 --> 00:45:39.291
The Kryptonian.

988
00:45:39.458 --> 00:45:40.376
Just like...

989
00:45:40.459 --> 00:45:41.377
I told you,

990
00:45:41.502 --> 00:45:44.421
I needed the world's
strongest Kryptonian.

991
00:45:44.505 --> 00:45:45.547
That was.

992
00:45:46.006 --> 00:45:47.925
Wait. You mean--

993
00:45:48.008 --> 00:45:51.178
Unlike that one,
Kara's strength is yet to peak.

994
00:45:51.303 --> 00:45:53.680
Her strong will alone
makes her far more suitable

995
00:45:53.764 --> 00:45:56.308
for divinity than this useless thing.

996
00:45:58.227 --> 00:45:59.061
Wait!

997
00:45:59.686 --> 00:46:01.355
He may not be completely useless.

998
00:46:05.234 --> 00:46:08.904
Our only chance is to catch the Legion
off guard with a surprise offensive.

999
00:46:08.987 --> 00:46:11.031
Like going by these schematics
Batman gave you,

1000
00:46:11.323 --> 00:46:12.908
I don't see any way to sneak in.

1001
00:46:13.033 --> 00:46:14.910
But maybe we could sneak out.

1002
00:46:19.915 --> 00:46:21.291
Hey, what gives? It's empty.

1003
00:46:21.375 --> 00:46:22.418
Sorry.

1004
00:46:22.501 --> 00:46:24.002
I downloaded the data
to figure out a way

1005
00:46:24.086 --> 00:46:26.130
to get to the Phantom Zone
and rescue our friends.

1006
00:46:26.296 --> 00:46:29.425
You mean, you think you can create
our own dimensional portal?

1007
00:46:29.508 --> 00:46:30.342
Exactly.

1008
00:46:30.592 --> 00:46:32.886
But now I'm thinking we can create
something even better.

1009
00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:34.930
Whoa! A dimensional waterslide?

1010
00:46:35.139 --> 00:46:38.684
So, we know Cythonna's magic has
unlimited access to the Phantom Zone,

1011
00:46:38.851 --> 00:46:40.561
which makes the amulet like a hub.

1012
00:46:40.686 --> 00:46:41.687
Theoretically speaking,

1013
00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:43.397
it correlates with what
quantum physicists call

1014
00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:44.982
a Hamiltonian density matrix.

1015
00:46:45.232 --> 00:46:46.066
Here, look.

1016
00:46:46.233 --> 00:46:49.069
Bottom line, a way in is a way out.

1017
00:46:49.278 --> 00:46:51.155
Wait. I see what Karen's thinking.

1018
00:46:51.405 --> 00:46:53.615
You figure out a way to travel
to the Phantom Zone,

1019
00:46:53.699 --> 00:46:54.616
grab our friends,

1020
00:46:54.783 --> 00:46:56.493
but then come back through the amulet.

1021
00:46:56.577 --> 00:46:58.829
Which would put us smack-dab
in the middle of

1022
00:46:58.912 --> 00:47:00.330
the Hall of Doom.

1023
00:47:00.414 --> 00:47:02.875
With all of the heroes in full force.

1024
00:47:03.042 --> 00:47:04.877
Talk about a sneak attack.

1025
00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:06.503
Do you really think you could do it?

1026
00:47:06.587 --> 00:47:08.714
No, but you can.

1027
00:47:08.797 --> 00:47:09.840
Uh, come again?

1028
00:47:09.923 --> 00:47:12.009
I can figure out how to navigate
through dimensions

1029
00:47:12.134 --> 00:47:13.177
but without the right tech,

1030
00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:15.554
we have to travel the same way
Cythonna does.

1031
00:47:15.763 --> 00:47:16.930
With magic.

1032
00:47:17.639 --> 00:47:19.975
Well, why didn't you say so?
I'm your girl.

1033
00:47:20.726 --> 00:47:22.394
[Bumblebee] Dark magic.

1034
00:47:22.644 --> 00:47:25.230
Oh, dark... [chuckles nervously]

1035
00:47:25.397 --> 00:47:27.941
Yeah, I mean, I guess.

1036
00:47:28.442 --> 00:47:29.693
[Cythonna whispering] <i>Kara.</i>

1037
00:47:30.277 --> 00:47:32.654
[Cythonna whispering] <i>Kara Zor-El.</i>

1038
00:47:33.197 --> 00:47:35.282
[Cythonna] Kara Zor-El of Krypton.

1039
00:47:42.956 --> 00:47:44.333
Cythonna.

1040
00:47:44.625 --> 00:47:47.711
I apologize if I interrupted you
and your friends

1041
00:47:47.836 --> 00:47:50.964
planning what promises to be
an adorable yet futile attack.

1042
00:47:51.298 --> 00:47:52.341
What do you want?

1043
00:47:52.966 --> 00:47:55.427
Simple. I want you to come get...

1044
00:47:55.969 --> 00:47:56.887
Him.

1045
00:47:56.970 --> 00:47:58.055
Kal. No!

1046
00:47:58.138 --> 00:47:59.139
[Cythonna] Want him?

1047
00:47:59.723 --> 00:48:01.183
Come get him.

1048
00:48:02.101 --> 00:48:04.645
Goddess or not, I swear I will beat you.

1049
00:48:05.312 --> 00:48:06.814
Kara.

1050
00:48:06.897 --> 00:48:08.607
Kara, are you okay?

1051
00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:10.776
Listen, Diana,
you go rescue our friends.

1052
00:48:11.193 --> 00:48:12.653
I need to face Cythonna.

1053
00:48:12.736 --> 00:48:14.988
What? Kara, I must insist--

1054
00:48:15.072 --> 00:48:17.449
I know. I know. You think
I'm being my bullheaded self,

1055
00:48:17.533 --> 00:48:19.410
and I am.

1056
00:48:19.493 --> 00:48:21.453
But they have Clark.

1057
00:48:21.537 --> 00:48:22.621
-Then we should--
-Diana,

1058
00:48:22.746 --> 00:48:26.041
I am asking you to trust me now.

1059
00:48:30.295 --> 00:48:31.755
[computer trilling, beeping]

1060
00:48:32.172 --> 00:48:34.007
[Bumblebee] Okay. I think
we're ready to go.

1061
00:48:35.342 --> 00:48:37.469
-Where's Kara?
-Supergirl will meet us there.

1062
00:48:38.011 --> 00:48:40.097
Trust she knows
what she's doing, sisters.

1063
00:48:40.222 --> 00:48:41.140
I do.

1064
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:42.725
Now, let us away.

1065
00:48:42.891 --> 00:48:45.936
All aboard The Phantom Zone Express.

1066
00:48:46.061 --> 00:48:47.020
Bubble us up, Jess.

1067
00:48:51.817 --> 00:48:53.610
Okay, Zee. Go time.

1068
00:48:53.694 --> 00:48:57.322
All right. Dark, creepy and often
uncontrollable magic coming up.

1069
00:48:57.406 --> 00:48:58.407
It's okay, Zee.

1070
00:48:58.490 --> 00:48:59.533
You got this.

1071
00:49:01.118 --> 00:49:02.619
[indistinct muttering]

1072
00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:08.167
[all screaming]

1073
00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:13.547
I never thought I would say this, but,

1074
00:49:13.714 --> 00:49:16.800
burritos for lunch was a horrible idea.

1075
00:49:16.884 --> 00:49:20.679
Zee, each off-shoot tunnel is a gateway
to a different dimension.

1076
00:49:20.804 --> 00:49:22.765
The Phantom Zone is coming up.

1077
00:49:22.848 --> 00:49:24.475
Now, make sure you...

1078
00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:25.851
[Dark Zee] <i>You're gonna blow it.</i>

1079
00:49:25.976 --> 00:49:27.811
Stop it. Stop.

1080
00:49:28.145 --> 00:49:30.564
I can do this. I can.

1081
00:49:30.647 --> 00:49:32.316
You don't seem so sure of yourself.

1082
00:49:32.399 --> 00:49:33.817
How can you be sure of anything

1083
00:49:33.901 --> 00:49:35.235
when you're not even sure
of who you are?

1084
00:49:35.319 --> 00:49:36.904
You're nothing. A nobody.

1085
00:49:36.987 --> 00:49:37.863
No one loves you.

1086
00:49:37.988 --> 00:49:39.323
-You are a freak.
-A phoney.

1087
00:49:39.406 --> 00:49:40.449
A monster.

1088
00:49:40.532 --> 00:49:42.201
No wonder your mom left.

1089
00:49:42.451 --> 00:49:43.660
[shouting] Stop it.

1090
00:49:44.912 --> 00:49:46.288
[all screaming]

1091
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.710
Did I do it?

1092
00:49:51.877 --> 00:49:54.797
I'm not sure, but I think so.

1093
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:57.257
Sisters, at the ready.

1094
00:49:58.050 --> 00:50:00.803
Weird. Awfully bright
for a Phantom Zone.

1095
00:50:02.721 --> 00:50:05.891
Are we sure
we're in the right dimension?

1096
00:50:07.393 --> 00:50:08.894
No, I'm not sure.

1097
00:50:09.269 --> 00:50:10.687
The dark magic...

1098
00:50:10.896 --> 00:50:12.064
It's okay, Zee.

1099
00:50:12.314 --> 00:50:15.359
I mean, we don't know
that this isn't the Phantom Zone.

1100
00:50:15.734 --> 00:50:17.111
Yeah, of course it is.

1101
00:50:17.361 --> 00:50:19.446
Now, let's find the other heroes.

1102
00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:21.240
Uh, I see heroes,

1103
00:50:21.573 --> 00:50:24.118
but I don't think they're the ones
we're looking for.

1104
00:50:25.828 --> 00:50:27.579
BB, you seeing what I'm seeing?

1105
00:50:29.039 --> 00:50:31.166
It's the Super Hero Girls, yo.

1106
00:50:34.294 --> 00:50:37.923
Oh, yes, the team
I wish to be the member of,

1107
00:50:38.006 --> 00:50:42.428
but refuse to say as such so as to spare
the feelings of my current team.

1108
00:50:47.015 --> 00:50:49.893
We actually have a door, but whatever.

1109
00:50:51.937 --> 00:50:54.940
Oh, come on.
This literally happened yesterday.

1110
00:50:55.023 --> 00:50:58.902
You mean, we've already been
crossed over and no one told us?

1111
00:50:59.361 --> 00:51:01.864
Well, the hits just keep on coming.

1112
00:51:02.531 --> 00:51:03.574
Just watch.

1113
00:51:03.949 --> 00:51:05.492
You'll play a very important role

1114
00:51:05.659 --> 00:51:06.827
in this story before its end.

1115
00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:08.704
Trust me! [chuckles]

1116
00:51:09.913 --> 00:51:10.873
Hmm.

1117
00:51:10.956 --> 00:51:13.292
We apologize, but do we know you?

1118
00:51:13.625 --> 00:51:14.793
[laughs]

1119
00:51:15.002 --> 00:51:16.336
Good one, Wonder lady.

1120
00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:18.255
I didn't realize you were the funny one.

1121
00:51:18.338 --> 00:51:20.215
It's like you're the 'me' of your team.

1122
00:51:20.299 --> 00:51:22.259
Come on, guys. It's us.

1123
00:51:22.342 --> 00:51:23.886
The Teen Titans.

1124
00:51:24.011 --> 00:51:25.637
You mean, the tween titans.

1125
00:51:26.013 --> 00:51:27.389
Didn't we babysit you once?

1126
00:51:27.598 --> 00:51:28.432
"Babysit"?

1127
00:51:29.224 --> 00:51:31.685
Do I in any way look like a baby to you?

1128
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:34.354
[Beast Boy] Oh, I gets it.

1129
00:51:34.563 --> 00:51:36.065
They are good enough for our show,

1130
00:51:36.148 --> 00:51:37.858
but the moments we shows up
in their thing,

1131
00:51:37.941 --> 00:51:39.693
it's all like, "What's going on?

1132
00:51:39.818 --> 00:51:40.819
Who's are you?"

1133
00:51:40.944 --> 00:51:41.904
Hey, that's right!

1134
00:51:41.987 --> 00:51:43.530
Continuity snobs.

1135
00:51:43.697 --> 00:51:45.991
Guys, I think I know what's going on.

1136
00:51:46.367 --> 00:51:49.328
We've ended up in some kind
of parallel universe.

1137
00:51:49.912 --> 00:51:51.747
One that's similar to ours.

1138
00:51:51.997 --> 00:51:54.333
But with way larger heads.

1139
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:55.876
And hands.

1140
00:51:55.959 --> 00:51:57.336
Our hands are very large too

1141
00:51:58.879 --> 00:52:00.381
So I guess I did mess up.

1142
00:52:01.590 --> 00:52:05.094
As fellow heroes, you can appreciate
the gravity of our mission,

1143
00:52:05.177 --> 00:52:08.389
for we face a crisis
of catastrophic proportions.

1144
00:52:08.472 --> 00:52:10.349
[giggling]

1145
00:52:10.432 --> 00:52:12.559
Forgive us if we seem underwhelmed

1146
00:52:12.726 --> 00:52:15.354
but we eat crises of
catastrophic proportions

1147
00:52:15.521 --> 00:52:16.647
for breakfast.

1148
00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:19.441
They're called jalapeno waffle bombs,
yo. Ha-ha!

1149
00:52:19.691 --> 00:52:22.194
Okay, Super Hero Girls, we'll help you.

1150
00:52:22.528 --> 00:52:24.738
Really, we just need a couple
of spare computer parts.

1151
00:52:24.822 --> 00:52:26.490
But I'm only saying this once.

1152
00:52:26.573 --> 00:52:28.367
My world. My rules.

1153
00:52:28.575 --> 00:52:29.827
I call the shots.

1154
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:31.787
I say jump, you say, "I already did

1155
00:52:31.912 --> 00:52:34.289
because I'm so in tune
with your amazing leadership skills,

1156
00:52:34.373 --> 00:52:36.625
I knew what you were going to ask me
before you could even ask it."

1157
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:38.794
[inhales deeply] Are we clear?

1158
00:52:39.211 --> 00:52:40.087
Oh, wow.

1159
00:52:40.170 --> 00:52:41.964
Is it possible that
you're even more annoying

1160
00:52:42.131 --> 00:52:43.424
than the Robin in my universe?

1161
00:52:50.806 --> 00:52:51.890
I'm pretty sure I can fix it.

1162
00:52:51.974 --> 00:52:52.850
True. True.

1163
00:52:52.933 --> 00:52:54.184
But let me hit you with this.

1164
00:52:54.268 --> 00:52:56.729
Why fix when you can upgrade?

1165
00:52:56.812 --> 00:52:58.480
Because I only need to...

1166
00:52:58.564 --> 00:52:59.815
Picture it, other BB.

1167
00:52:59.898 --> 00:53:03.444
This baby, with its own ultra TK
mega library of video games.

1168
00:53:03.610 --> 00:53:05.195
A taquito warming drawer.

1169
00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:06.280
Racing stripes.

1170
00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:08.741
Why would a computer
need racing stripes?

1171
00:53:09.491 --> 00:53:11.827
A computer would not need
racing stripes.

1172
00:53:11.994 --> 00:53:14.747
But a remote control
funnel cake deep-fryer would.

1173
00:53:14.913 --> 00:53:15.873
No way.

1174
00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:19.376
Any animal?

1175
00:53:19.543 --> 00:53:20.419
Mmm-hmm.

1176
00:53:20.586 --> 00:53:22.254
How about a fairy armadillo?

1177
00:53:23.672 --> 00:53:24.798
Oh, an aye-aye.

1178
00:53:24.882 --> 00:53:26.258
Aye. Aye.

1179
00:53:26.467 --> 00:53:27.301
Ooh!

1180
00:53:27.426 --> 00:53:28.385
A Chengdu yak.

1181
00:53:28.844 --> 00:53:31.096
Ooh! Does this mean
you have four stomachs?

1182
00:53:31.221 --> 00:53:32.056
I don't knows.

1183
00:53:32.264 --> 00:53:33.098
Let's find out.

1184
00:53:42.107 --> 00:53:42.941
[gasps]

1185
00:53:43.067 --> 00:53:43.901
[stomach rumbling]

1186
00:53:43.984 --> 00:53:45.611
[groans] That's not sitting right.

1187
00:53:45.778 --> 00:53:47.613
Ah, better.

1188
00:53:47.696 --> 00:53:48.530
Hold up!

1189
00:53:48.697 --> 00:53:49.615
[stomach rumbling]

1190
00:53:51.492 --> 00:53:52.326
[sighs in relief]

1191
00:53:52.409 --> 00:53:54.119
Uh-oh. Here comes number three.

1192
00:53:54.244 --> 00:53:55.245
[shrieking]

1193
00:53:55.537 --> 00:53:57.247
How is it getting worse each time?

1194
00:53:57.539 --> 00:53:58.374
[pants]

1195
00:53:58.457 --> 00:53:59.291
[sighs in relief]

1196
00:53:59.541 --> 00:54:00.376
[stomach rumbling]

1197
00:54:00.542 --> 00:54:01.460
Last one.

1198
00:54:02.044 --> 00:54:02.878
[groans]

1199
00:54:03.462 --> 00:54:04.546
[sighs in relief]

1200
00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:06.548
Four stomachs in the house.

1201
00:54:06.924 --> 00:54:07.758
[stomach rumbling]

1202
00:54:07.841 --> 00:54:10.010
I got to go to the little yak's room.

1203
00:54:12.721 --> 00:54:13.555
[shrieks]

1204
00:54:16.225 --> 00:54:17.559
Oh, hey, Starfire.

1205
00:54:18.185 --> 00:54:21.188
You guys sure do
things differently here.

1206
00:54:21.271 --> 00:54:23.941
I, too, was a comer
to the newness of this world

1207
00:54:24.024 --> 00:54:26.527
on a day that was
not long from this one.

1208
00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:28.195
Bet that took getting used to.

1209
00:54:28.278 --> 00:54:30.447
Permit me to give the piece of advice?

1210
00:54:30.614 --> 00:54:31.824
Sure, let's hear it.

1211
00:54:32.241 --> 00:54:35.160
[whispering] Despite the deliciousness
of their appearance,

1212
00:54:35.452 --> 00:54:38.414
cats may not be ingested.

1213
00:54:41.583 --> 00:54:44.837
Oh. Uh, thank you, Starfire.

1214
00:54:45.087 --> 00:54:46.338
Good to know.

1215
00:54:47.756 --> 00:54:49.383
Yeah, my team would
pretty much follow me

1216
00:54:49.466 --> 00:54:50.509
to the end of the Earth.

1217
00:54:50.592 --> 00:54:51.635
I mean, it's not like

1218
00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:53.679
being a better team leader
is a competition.

1219
00:54:53.762 --> 00:54:56.181
It's just, well, if it were,
I'd probably win.

1220
00:54:56.306 --> 00:54:57.808
And, if this mug is to be believed,

1221
00:54:57.891 --> 00:54:59.226
I already have.

1222
00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:01.854
You bought that yourself, didn't you?

1223
00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:03.689
[chuckles nervously] What? No!

1224
00:55:04.106 --> 00:55:07.985
Sheesh! Sounds like someone's got
a little mug envy.

1225
00:55:08.068 --> 00:55:09.570
Well, I have no mug,

1226
00:55:09.653 --> 00:55:11.780
nor any such boastful
beverage conveyance.

1227
00:55:11.864 --> 00:55:15.409
I do have a lasso that can compel anyone
to tell the truth.

1228
00:55:15.492 --> 00:55:16.618
Would you like to try it?

1229
00:55:17.244 --> 00:55:18.078
[mug breaking]

1230
00:55:18.203 --> 00:55:19.246
[high-pitched voice] I bought the mug.

1231
00:55:23.792 --> 00:55:25.544
You find them instantly
annoying too, huh?

1232
00:55:27.087 --> 00:55:27.921
[laughs softly]

1233
00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:29.298
They're not so bad.

1234
00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:33.635
We only have one bonehead on our team.

1235
00:55:34.011 --> 00:55:34.928
Me.

1236
00:55:35.054 --> 00:55:36.805
It's my fault we're stuck here.

1237
00:55:37.848 --> 00:55:38.849
Messed up a spell?

1238
00:55:38.932 --> 00:55:40.017
It happens.

1239
00:55:42.102 --> 00:55:43.145
It's more than a spell.

1240
00:55:44.063 --> 00:55:45.606
There's a part of me.

1241
00:55:45.814 --> 00:55:46.899
A dark part.

1242
00:55:47.483 --> 00:55:49.193
I've always been frightened of it.

1243
00:55:49.610 --> 00:55:50.903
But, lately...

1244
00:55:52.279 --> 00:55:54.239
Never mind, it's complicated.

1245
00:55:55.866 --> 00:55:56.742
Yeah.

1246
00:55:56.909 --> 00:55:58.369
I wish there was some way
I could relate.

1247
00:55:58.911 --> 00:56:00.371
Oh, wait. I just remembered.

1248
00:56:00.621 --> 00:56:02.915
I am Raven, daughter of Trigon,

1249
00:56:03.082 --> 00:56:06.085
demonic overlord of all he surveys.

1250
00:56:10.881 --> 00:56:12.549
[both laugh]

1251
00:56:17.513 --> 00:56:18.806
Not bad, other BB.

1252
00:56:18.972 --> 00:56:21.225
-We did it.
-You were right.

1253
00:56:21.475 --> 00:56:23.394
The racing stripes are a nice touch.

1254
00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:24.812
You two got the computer working?

1255
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:27.022
I just need to power
the external V-drive.

1256
00:56:27.231 --> 00:56:30.359
So we'll need a AAA battery,
like the one in a TV remote.

1257
00:56:34.321 --> 00:56:36.115
[exclaiming nervously]

1258
00:56:36.365 --> 00:56:38.158
Our universe doesn't have remotes.

1259
00:56:38.325 --> 00:56:39.827
Yeah, yeah.

1260
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:41.995
We's control TVs with our minds.

1261
00:56:42.413 --> 00:56:43.247
[button clicks]

1262
00:56:45.332 --> 00:56:47.918
Fear not. We will find a battery--

1263
00:56:48.001 --> 00:56:49.878
Oh, yeah. <i>Battleship Bake Off!</i>

1264
00:56:50.045 --> 00:56:52.798
So, did you have a battery, or no?

1265
00:56:53.799 --> 00:56:55.718
Huh? Battery? Oh, yeah.

1266
00:56:55.801 --> 00:56:56.635
Help yourself.

1267
00:56:56.719 --> 00:56:58.095
I think I saw one in the garage.

1268
00:56:58.262 --> 00:57:00.097
Or did I see one in the foyer?

1269
00:57:00.347 --> 00:57:01.974
Ooh la-la. Fo-yay.

1270
00:57:02.141 --> 00:57:04.226
[laughs] He means fo-yur, yo.

1271
00:57:04.393 --> 00:57:06.228
Fo-yur? Where's your flair?

1272
00:57:06.311 --> 00:57:07.187
Your passion?

1273
00:57:07.312 --> 00:57:08.647
Get some culture, fool.

1274
00:57:08.772 --> 00:57:10.858
-It's pronounced fo-yur, bro.
-Nah-uh.

1275
00:57:10.941 --> 00:57:12.443
Fo-yay, all the way.

1276
00:57:12.526 --> 00:57:14.111
Of course, this building comes equipped

1277
00:57:14.194 --> 00:57:16.989
with neither the fo-yur, nor the fo-yay.

1278
00:57:17.281 --> 00:57:19.533
That's really not the point now,
is it, Starfire?

1279
00:57:19.616 --> 00:57:21.035
We do so have a foyer.

1280
00:57:21.118 --> 00:57:22.828
Wait. That's really more of a portico.

1281
00:57:22.911 --> 00:57:24.455
Do you have a battery or not?

1282
00:57:25.289 --> 00:57:26.623
Yes. You remind me of me.

1283
00:57:26.707 --> 00:57:28.375
Let's go find one.

1284
00:57:28.751 --> 00:57:29.585
[objects clattering]

1285
00:57:29.752 --> 00:57:32.337
Oh, oh, no, he did not.

1286
00:57:33.130 --> 00:57:34.590
Right, let's go.

1287
00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:39.553
So, Luthor,
what's the first order of business

1288
00:57:39.636 --> 00:57:42.139
as rulers of the world? [giggles]

1289
00:57:42.890 --> 00:57:43.974
Luthor?

1290
00:57:45.642 --> 00:57:47.269
Uh, hello?

1291
00:57:47.352 --> 00:57:48.187
What's with him?

1292
00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:49.229
[crashing]

1293
00:57:53.067 --> 00:57:54.151
Where is Superman?

1294
00:57:57.946 --> 00:57:59.698
Where is Superman?

1295
00:57:59.782 --> 00:58:00.908
[Giganta] Get her!

1296
00:58:02.951 --> 00:58:03.869
[Cythonna] That's enough, children.

1297
00:58:07.748 --> 00:58:09.375
Come, let's talk.

1298
00:58:12.878 --> 00:58:15.506
You've always believed in me, yes?

1299
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:17.800
Let's just say I heard stories.

1300
00:58:17.883 --> 00:58:20.719
Then you know my essence
will soon be free,

1301
00:58:20.803 --> 00:58:24.681
and I shall require a strong,
new Kryptonian body.

1302
00:58:24.765 --> 00:58:27.893
Ain't happening.
Kal-El's coming with me.

1303
00:58:27.976 --> 00:58:32.731
Oh. And you wonder why others presume
Kal-El is superior to you,

1304
00:58:32.898 --> 00:58:35.692
when you yourself
make the same presumption.

1305
00:58:35.776 --> 00:58:38.946
Wait, you mean, you... you want me?

1306
00:58:39.446 --> 00:58:43.450
Well, I mean, I can't blame you.
I am pretty awesome.

1307
00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:50.374
Join me, and together, we will show
the universe the true meaning of power.

1308
00:58:51.208 --> 00:58:53.752
Yeah, that's going to be a hard pass.

1309
00:58:53.961 --> 00:58:55.754
Oh, well, in that case...

1310
00:58:56.213 --> 00:58:59.466
[ominous music playing]

1311
00:58:59.633 --> 00:59:01.593
-Kal!
-Submit...

1312
00:59:02.177 --> 00:59:03.429
-or he dies.
-[gasps]

1313
00:59:04.722 --> 00:59:06.390
I'll give you
some time to think about it.

1314
00:59:06.557 --> 00:59:08.308
[screaming]

1315
00:59:08.559 --> 00:59:09.476
[thuds]

1316
00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:11.603
No! You can't do this.

1317
00:59:11.729 --> 00:59:15.899
[sinister music playing]

1318
00:59:17.151 --> 00:59:19.153
It's not about
not having dark thoughts, Zee.

1319
00:59:19.236 --> 00:59:22.114
It's about embracing those thoughts
as part of who you are.

1320
00:59:22.406 --> 00:59:25.284
But what if I do embrace them,
and I lose control?

1321
00:59:25.743 --> 00:59:27.453
What if I hurt someone?

1322
00:59:27.536 --> 00:59:29.288
Hmm. You might be surprised

1323
00:59:29.371 --> 00:59:30.998
what darkness can do,
if you give it a chance.

1324
00:59:31.331 --> 00:59:32.958
Out of all the infinite universes,

1325
00:59:33.042 --> 00:59:35.210
your magic just happened
to bring you here,

1326
00:59:35.294 --> 00:59:37.755
where you got a brief and
narratively convenient pep-talk

1327
00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:40.340
from someone who deals
with the exact same thing.

1328
00:59:43.177 --> 00:59:45.095
[creature roaring]

1329
00:59:47.347 --> 00:59:49.349
Yeesh! Who would've thunk
getting a little battery

1330
00:59:49.433 --> 00:59:50.851
would become such an epic hassle?

1331
00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:53.187
Dude, we face way epic-er hassles

1332
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:55.522
for much smaller stakes all the time.

1333
00:59:55.606 --> 00:59:56.523
It's kind of our thing.

1334
00:59:57.775 --> 01:00:00.235
[electronic whirring]

1335
01:00:00.319 --> 01:00:03.781
Back online and ready to go.
I just hope Zee's up to it.

1336
01:00:05.532 --> 01:00:08.077
Next up, Phantom Zone.

1337
01:00:08.911 --> 01:00:12.956
You know, you might want to bring
the big guns with you on this mission.

1338
01:00:14.166 --> 01:00:15.959
Are they fighting over a remote?

1339
01:00:16.043 --> 01:00:19.421
Come on, BB. I've seen this episode.
[grunts]

1340
01:00:21.548 --> 01:00:24.218
Er, we appreciate the offer, Boy Wonder.

1341
01:00:24.301 --> 01:00:25.594
But this is our fight.

1342
01:00:25.677 --> 01:00:26.720
No, I get it.

1343
01:00:26.887 --> 01:00:28.722
It's your big adventure.

1344
01:00:29.056 --> 01:00:30.891
Bringing us along would
only upstage you.

1345
01:00:31.475 --> 01:00:34.937
I guess this is goodbye.
Thank you, Raven.

1346
01:00:41.819 --> 01:00:43.153
Bye Cy.

1347
01:00:43.278 --> 01:00:44.905
Let me know how
<i>Battleship Bake Off</i> ends.

1348
01:00:45.072 --> 01:00:46.240
Peace, love and animals, yo!

1349
01:00:46.323 --> 01:00:47.700
Keep them racing stripes shiny.

1350
01:00:47.866 --> 01:00:49.118
Take me with you!

1351
01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:53.414
So long! By the way,
our adventure was in theaters.

1352
01:00:56.917 --> 01:00:57.918
You okay, Zee?

1353
01:00:58.669 --> 01:01:00.129
Oh, I'm better than okay.

1354
01:01:00.546 --> 01:01:01.588
Whee!

1355
01:01:06.051 --> 01:01:08.637
[grunts] Kara, I told you to--

1356
01:01:08.846 --> 01:01:10.681
I know what you told me, Kal.

1357
01:01:10.806 --> 01:01:12.850
Just because you think
you're so much better than me

1358
01:01:12.933 --> 01:01:14.017
doesn't mean you can tell me--

1359
01:01:14.101 --> 01:01:17.062
I'm not better than you, Kara.
Not by a long shot.

1360
01:01:20.023 --> 01:01:22.985
Then why are you
always such a jerk to me?

1361
01:01:23.110 --> 01:01:24.945
I never told you this, but

1362
01:01:25.028 --> 01:01:27.698
when you first got here,
I was so excited.

1363
01:01:27.781 --> 01:01:30.993
I thought, finally someone else
who will understand

1364
01:01:31.076 --> 01:01:33.037
just how lonely it is to be...

1365
01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:35.998
Super. You know,
saying it out loud just now...

1366
01:01:36.373 --> 01:01:39.293
Mm, it is kind of pretentious
to call ourselves that.

1367
01:01:39.376 --> 01:01:40.961
You're not lonely, Kara.

1368
01:01:41.045 --> 01:01:43.380
Look at your friends. They're family.

1369
01:01:43.464 --> 01:01:46.508
Then look at mine. Ugh, Batman? Really?

1370
01:01:46.592 --> 01:01:48.635
-Dude's got serious issues.
-Wait.

1371
01:01:48.969 --> 01:01:51.180
Are you jealous of my friends?

1372
01:01:51.263 --> 01:01:53.932
[sighs] I'm jealous of your strength.

1373
01:01:54.016 --> 01:01:57.227
Okay, I'm only going to say this because
you said something kind of nice, but,

1374
01:01:57.853 --> 01:02:01.148
Kal, you are way stronger than me.

1375
01:02:01.315 --> 01:02:03.067
Well, I am Superman.

1376
01:02:03.150 --> 01:02:06.070
[groaning] But that's not what I mean.

1377
01:02:07.237 --> 01:02:09.073
I was born with super strength.

1378
01:02:09.239 --> 01:02:12.242
It was handed to me. But, you,

1379
01:02:12.326 --> 01:02:15.162
your strength, your true strength

1380
01:02:15.245 --> 01:02:18.874
of character, of conviction,
you earned that on your own.

1381
01:02:19.583 --> 01:02:21.794
Way before you got anywhere
near a yellow sun.

1382
01:02:23.379 --> 01:02:25.464
Now we know there's gotta be an answer.

1383
01:02:25.756 --> 01:02:28.258
You just gotta use those noggins
right there, man.

1384
01:02:28.342 --> 01:02:30.260
You gotta use them to grab that answer.

1385
01:02:31.178 --> 01:02:33.055
Seriously, man, nothing?

1386
01:02:33.263 --> 01:02:37.851
-Is it a bread box?
-Ding-ding-ding, you got it.

1387
01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:40.938
Man, you're good, kid.
You are good. Whoo!

1388
01:02:41.897 --> 01:02:48.612
[instrumental music playing]

1389
01:02:49.405 --> 01:02:50.948
Anyone need a lift?

1390
01:02:51.615 --> 01:02:54.827
Any second, your master
shall be set free.

1391
01:02:55.411 --> 01:02:57.496
[electronic whirring]

1392
01:03:04.294 --> 01:03:06.630
Heroes! Take them down!

1393
01:03:12.052 --> 01:03:13.512
If I had my mace--

1394
01:03:14.012 --> 01:03:14.888
[grunts]

1395
01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:19.601
Huh?

1396
01:03:20.269 --> 01:03:22.312
I shrunk it down to bring to you,

1397
01:03:22.396 --> 01:03:25.774
but totally forgot about it until
you said something. Sorry.

1398
01:03:25.899 --> 01:03:28.277
Oh, I missed you too.

1399
01:03:28.569 --> 01:03:29.778
Hey, Batman!

1400
01:03:31.113 --> 01:03:34.742
So, I know you know about the Joker,
but did you hear about me and Bane?

1401
01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:39.246
[muttering]

1402
01:03:39.329 --> 01:03:43.375
Oh, you did? Yeah? I beat him
pretty good. First try, too. Heh.

1403
01:03:43.459 --> 01:03:44.835
How'd you do against him
your first time?

1404
01:03:45.502 --> 01:03:46.378

[snarling]

1406
01:03:51.216 --> 01:03:54.511
I wish I had a clever remark
about you both being feline villains.

1407
01:04:02.519 --> 01:04:05.689
Looks as if you two
are ready for a cat nap.

1408
01:04:06.273 --> 01:04:07.357
Stick with what you know, Diana.

1409

[grunting]

1410
01:04:12.321 --> 01:04:15.532
Oh, that the hardest Lantern can hit?

1411
01:04:15.699 --> 01:04:16.575
[Jon] No.

1412
01:04:19.078 --> 01:04:21.163
That is the hardest Lantern can hit.

1413
01:04:21.497 --> 01:04:23.665
Oh, now I get why they went with you.

1414

[groaning] Grundy angry.

1416
01:04:30.964 --> 01:04:34.093
How many Lanterns are there?

1417
01:04:34.176 --> 01:04:36.428
Three. It's a big number, I know.

1418
01:04:36.512 --> 01:04:38.097
Keep trying, you'll get there.

1419

1420
01:04:42.142 --> 01:04:44.686
These no hold Grundy.

1421
01:04:44.770 --> 01:04:46.563
Yeah, that's kind of the point.

1422
01:04:48.857 --> 01:04:51.568
Oh, and all without
even throwing a punch.

1423
01:04:51.652 --> 01:04:53.278
Ah, look at that!

1424
01:04:53.362 --> 01:04:56.281
Got you again. Totally feeling
deja vu right now.

1425
01:04:56.365 --> 01:04:57.991
[laughs] So am I.

1426
01:04:58.075 --> 01:04:59.034
[ominous music playing]

1427
01:04:59.118 --> 01:05:01.412
-Back off, slick!
-Huh? [grunts]

1428
01:05:01.495 --> 01:05:04.748
Throwing cheap shots
at this one's my job.

1429
01:05:05.666 --> 01:05:08.585
Oh, my gosh, you changed your mind.

1430
01:05:08.836 --> 01:05:12.089
Come on! You knew I was always
gonna come around.

1431
01:05:12.172 --> 01:05:15.008
I just wanted to make
one of those perfectly-timed

1432
01:05:15.092 --> 01:05:17.720
bad-guy-turns-good dramatic entrances.

1433
01:05:17.803 --> 01:05:18.971
How'd I do?

1434
01:05:19.138 --> 01:05:21.348
Oh, pretty good. Thanks.

1435
01:05:21.932 --> 01:05:24.393
Can you see what's happening?

1436
01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:27.521
Kryptonite's messing
with my X-ray vision.

1437
01:05:27.688 --> 01:05:29.231
-Oh, no.
-What is it?

1438
01:05:30.691 --> 01:05:32.860
-She's free.
-Quick, Kara.

1439

[grunting]

1440
01:05:35.779 --> 01:05:36.905
You gotta run.

1441
01:05:37.197 --> 01:05:38.365
She'll come for you.

1442
01:05:38.449 --> 01:05:40.826
[sighs] I'm not leaving you
like this, Kal.

1443
01:05:40.993 --> 01:05:42.953
Why do you have to be so bullheaded?

1444
01:05:43.037 --> 01:05:45.706
Yeah, yeah, I am bullheaded, aren't I?

1445
01:05:46.165 --> 01:05:47.958
Cythonna, I give up.

1446
01:05:48.792 --> 01:05:49.877
Do you hear me?

1447
01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:52.004
Kara... [grunts] What are you doing?

1448
01:05:52.087 --> 01:05:53.047
[Supergirl] Sorry, Kal.

1449
01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:54.423
I have no choice.

1450
01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.300
It's your lucky day.

1451
01:05:56.550 --> 01:05:59.011
I give up to you, Cythonna.

1452
01:05:59.219 --> 01:06:00.763
I'm all yours.

1453
01:06:00.888 --> 01:06:03.390
[grunts] Kara! No!

1454
01:06:03.766 --> 01:06:06.018
[laughs wickedly]

1455
01:06:09.438 --> 01:06:10.314
Okay.

1456
01:06:10.606 --> 01:06:11.940
What exactly happened here?

1457
01:06:12.524 --> 01:06:16.320
[groans] Felt like evil overdrive.

1458
01:06:16.695 --> 01:06:18.197
Totally grody.

1459
01:06:18.489 --> 01:06:19.406
Ugh!

1460
01:06:22.159 --> 01:06:23.452
That's the last of 'em, Wonder Woman.

1461
01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:26.038
Good work, Hal.
Any sign of Supergirl yet?

1462
01:06:26.121 --> 01:06:28.332
Nope. Not of her or Superman.

1463
01:06:28.749 --> 01:06:29.666
Come on, Kara,

1464
01:06:30.876 --> 01:06:32.127

1465
01:06:34.254 --> 01:06:35.255
Kara?

1466
01:06:38.509 --> 01:06:39.760
Kara is gone.

1467
01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:42.805
I am Cythonna.

1468
01:06:44.431 --> 01:06:45.641
What do we do, Wonder Woman?

1469
01:06:56.026 --> 01:06:58.445
Hal, you and the others
get the Legion to safety.

1470
01:06:58.529 --> 01:06:59.530
We got Cythonna.

1471
01:06:59.613 --> 01:07:01.240
No way. She's too powerful.

1472
01:07:01.448 --> 01:07:03.492
Carter, they can handle it.

1473
01:07:03.909 --> 01:07:06.120
This is a job for the Super Hero Girls.

1474
01:07:06.245 --> 01:07:07.204
Mmm-hmm.

1475
01:07:11.875 --> 01:07:13.627
Okay, Dee, what's the plan?

1476
01:07:17.339 --> 01:07:18.799
We fight.

1477
01:07:20.050 --> 01:07:23.053
I was so hoping you would say that.

01:07:49.747 --> 01:07:54.251
A rather strange representation
of your inner mind, Kara Zor-El.

1486
01:07:54.793 --> 01:07:56.462
It's my happy place.

1487
01:07:56.545 --> 01:07:59.548
Means I still run things in here.

1488
01:07:59.631 --> 01:08:02.217
I knew I wouldn't stand a chance
against you in the real world,

1489
01:08:02.384 --> 01:08:03.635
but I figure now,

1490
01:08:03.719 --> 01:08:06.013
at least I have some
home-field advantage.

1491
01:08:07.014 --> 01:08:09.224
[laughs mischievously]

1492
01:08:10.059 --> 01:08:12.936
Wait, are you challenging me?

1493
01:08:13.437 --> 01:08:15.397
Yeah, something like that.

What do you mean,

Seems even I underestimated you.

Wow. I remember when you would have
killed to be his sidekick.

Well, I've got my own sidekick now.

Oh, no, you're the sidekick.

01:12:29.526 --> 01:12:31.278
And we weren't even in it.

1584
01:12:31.361 --> 01:12:32.946
I am not understanding.

1585
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:35.908
You said we had the role
that is big to play.

1586
01:12:35.991 --> 01:12:37.493
Keep watching.

1587
01:12:39.036 --> 01:12:40.954
You know, Zee, I've been meaning to ask.

1588
01:12:41.038 --> 01:12:43.374
Where did you send
that Cythonna crystal anyway?

1589
01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:45.250
You know, since I've come
to terms with this

1590
01:12:45.334 --> 01:12:49.421
whole dark magic part of me,
I figured let it decide.

1591
01:12:50.172 --> 01:12:51.382
[all gasping]

1592
01:12:56.178 --> 01:12:58.764
[ominous music playing]

1593
01:13:04.478 --> 01:13:06.480
Now I know what you're up to,
Control Freak.

1594
01:13:06.730 --> 01:13:09.149
Or should I say, Cythonna!

1595
01:13:14.947 --> 01:13:16.490
[coughs]

1596
01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:19.326
Man, it's like a farago of B.O.,
barbecue corn chips

1597
01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:20.828
and rancid strawberry milk.

1598
01:13:21.912 --> 01:13:24.581
Cayenne and onion chips, thank you.

1599
01:13:24.665 --> 01:13:27.126
I knew something was up
when you complimented Robin.

1600
01:13:27.209 --> 01:13:28.502
Who does that?

1601
01:13:28.627 --> 01:13:30.587
But now you've shown your hand.

1602
01:13:30.671 --> 01:13:34.007
And for the record,
I was always on to you, Cythonna.

1603
01:13:34.133 --> 01:13:35.509
Even before Raven was, I'm sure.

1604
01:13:35.592 --> 01:13:39.096
But, I too was waiting for you
to show your hand.

1605
01:13:39.179 --> 01:13:40.139
Really?

1606
01:13:40.222 --> 01:13:42.182
What is my hand, Boy Wonder?

1607
01:13:42.975 --> 01:13:44.643
Well, [stuttering] I could tell you,

1608
01:13:44.727 --> 01:13:46.729
but I don't want to step
on Raven's toes.

1609
01:13:46.812 --> 01:13:48.147
She wants her crystal back.

1610
01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:54.695
That's right. It is mine.

1611
01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:55.904
Now, give it to me!

1612
01:13:56.321 --> 01:13:57.573
Starfire, catch.

1613
01:13:58.490 --> 01:14:00.284
-Give what to you?
-Ah!

1614
01:14:00.367 --> 01:14:01.452
The crystal!

1615
01:14:03.412 --> 01:14:06.040
Oh, you mean the crystal
that was in the hand,

1616
01:14:06.123 --> 01:14:08.083
but is now no longer in the hand

1617
01:14:08.167 --> 01:14:09.501
because of the keeping of away.

1618
01:14:09.585 --> 01:14:11.378
[Cythonna] Give it! Give it.

1619
01:14:11.837 --> 01:14:14.214
Horrible, horrible children.
Give it to me.

1620
01:14:14.339 --> 01:14:16.008
I demand it. My crystal.

1621
01:14:16.091 --> 01:14:18.677
Give it to me, you horrible,
horrible children.

1622
01:14:18.761 --> 01:14:19.720
I will destroy you.

1623
01:14:19.803 --> 01:14:21.764
I will destroy this whole universe.

1624
01:14:22.014 --> 01:14:24.808
We told you, C-train,
we don't do epic threats.

1625
01:14:24.975 --> 01:14:26.894
Raven, send this fool somewhere
they give a snot.

1626
01:14:27.728 --> 01:14:29.354
...at once! I demand you.

1627
01:14:29.438 --> 01:14:31.023
Please! I need it.

1628
01:14:31.106 --> 01:14:32.733
[yells] No!

1629
01:14:35.569 --> 01:14:36.612
Now what's we gonna dos?

1630
01:14:36.695 --> 01:14:38.947
I means, the TV's crooked, yo.

1631
01:14:39.031 --> 01:14:40.949
Nuh-uh. I can't watch a crooked TV.

1632
01:14:41.033 --> 01:14:43.327
You know the strain
that's gonna put on my neck servos?

1633
01:14:44.119 --> 01:14:47.664
So, Raven, where did you send
our friend and her little crystal?

1634
01:14:47.915 --> 01:14:49.708
I don't know. Somewhere.

1635
01:14:52.961 --> 01:14:56.256
<i>Meanwhile, at the Hall of Justice...</i>

1636
01:14:58.258 --> 01:15:00.803
Great Scott, what is this?

1637
01:15:03.639 --> 01:15:05.891
According to the Justice League
computer,

1638
01:15:06.016 --> 01:15:07.976
it's from this crossover dimension.

1639
01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:09.603
Holy crossovers!

1640
01:15:09.686 --> 01:15:11.146
Does this mean the Super Friends

1641
01:15:11.230 --> 01:15:14.066
have to travel to this strange
dimension and return it?

1642
01:15:16.902 --> 01:15:18.821
[clamoring]

1643
01:15:29.623 --> 01:15:33.961
That is going to be a hard pass
from the Super Friends.

1644
01:15:37.256 --> 01:15:39.174
[theme music playing]
