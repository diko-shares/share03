WEBVTT

1
00:03:14.088 --> 00:03:15.388
Hey, Merritt.

2
00:03:15.422 --> 00:03:16.890
Cathy's getting
another facelift.

3
00:03:16.924 --> 00:03:18.626
I said she'll look
like a wax monster.

4
00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:22.062
She said my acne's worse
than my cousin Greg.

5
00:03:22.096 --> 00:03:24.197
That's not true, your face looks

6
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.341
- Pretty fine to me.
- What's this?

7
00:03:25.365 --> 00:03:26.399
Oh.

8
00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:28.267
You were out in the woods again.

9
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:29.837
Yeah, only for a
few minutes, though.

10
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.171
Pull your hair back
and find a mirror.

11
00:03:32.205 --> 00:03:33.440
You look prehistoric.

12
00:03:35.442 --> 00:03:37.978
Ooh, something died
on your backpack.

13
00:03:38.012 --> 00:03:39.012
Ew, really?

14
00:03:40.114 --> 00:03:42.483
Janey, you can't stay like this.

15
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.958
Tribal, dig it.

16
00:03:55.462 --> 00:03:56.497
Great.

17
00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:12.913
Excuse me.

18
00:04:15.516 --> 00:04:16.550
Excuse me.

19
00:04:18.485 --> 00:04:19.687
When's the retake?

20
00:04:20.788 --> 00:04:21.989
Yes.

21
00:04:22.022 --> 00:04:23.590
Mr. Aunspach,
you never taught us

22
00:04:23.624 --> 00:04:24.858
anything on the test.

23
00:04:24.892 --> 00:04:26.694
The test was from the reading,

24
00:04:26.727 --> 00:04:28.294
like the last one.

25
00:04:28.327 --> 00:04:29.706
Okay, but no one
knew what they were doing,

26
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.499
like the last one, so.

27
00:04:34.435 --> 00:04:35.502
What's your flavor?

28
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.470
What?

29
00:04:38.472 --> 00:04:39.472
Grape, right?

30
00:04:41.141 --> 00:04:44.678
Mr. Aunspach, we
deserve a retake.

31
00:04:47.313 --> 00:04:48.449
Now.

32
00:04:58.758 --> 00:05:01.561
As you can see, this
problem is a lot

33
00:05:01.594 --> 00:05:04.163
like the last one from the test.

34
00:05:04.197 --> 00:05:06.065
Anyone wanna give it a try?

35
00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:07.533
Come on.

36
00:05:09.502 --> 00:05:11.369
Are you for real?

37
00:05:11.403 --> 00:05:13.271
- You want?
- I'm good.

38
00:05:13.305 --> 00:05:14.305
I think he does.

39
00:05:15.575 --> 00:05:16.676
Miss Shipley.

40
00:05:23.783 --> 00:05:24.783
Jane.

41
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.654
Will you come up?

42
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.939
Whoa.

43
00:06:53.806 --> 00:06:54.806
Fuck me.

44
00:06:57.476 --> 00:07:00.645
Looks like we won't be
needing that retake, after all.

45
00:07:00.679 --> 00:07:02.379
What, are you serious?

46
00:07:02.414 --> 00:07:05.217
- No, that's not fair.
- Enough.

47
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.484
She's the only one that got it.

48
00:07:06.518 --> 00:07:08.653
No one else got it,
that's not fair.

49
00:07:08.687 --> 00:07:10.055
I said enough!

50
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.663
One day, on the
prairie, a family

51
00:07:18.697 --> 00:07:20.699
was finishing the
last of their cabin,

52
00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:22.334
which they had been building

53
00:07:22.366 --> 00:07:24.536
the entire year, from scratch.

54
00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:28.840
While they were working
in the autumn chill,

55
00:07:28.874 --> 00:07:31.343
a woman, with holes in her coat

56
00:07:31.375 --> 00:07:33.778
and a fiddle under her
arm, walked up to them.

57
00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.884
"Please," she said,
"I'm hungry and cold.

58
00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:41.186
"Let me share a meal
and stay the night."

59
00:07:42.487 --> 00:07:43.955
The family was shocked.

60
00:07:45.724 --> 00:07:46.658
"How have you made it this far

61
00:07:46.691 --> 00:07:47.768
"with just the coat on your back

62
00:07:47.792 --> 00:07:49.060
"and a fiddle under your arm?

63
00:07:49.094 --> 00:07:50.829
"Have you no food, no shelter?"

64
00:07:50.862 --> 00:07:52.864
"What were you doing
this whole summer?"

65
00:07:54.733 --> 00:07:57.802
"Playing music,"
the fiddler said.

66
00:07:59.237 --> 00:08:01.206
"Before I knew it,
the chill had come.

67
00:08:01.239 --> 00:08:02.674
"Please, give me some bread."

68
00:08:02.707 --> 00:08:04.408
"I deserve some food."

69
00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:06.778
The family had no choice.

70
00:08:08.747 --> 00:08:12.384
They turned their backs and
went on with their work.

71
00:08:14.719 --> 00:08:18.290
The fiddler did not live
to play another summer.

72
00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:21.125
The end.

73
00:08:27.032 --> 00:08:30.068
Now, I think the family
had it all wrong, you see.

74
00:08:30.101 --> 00:08:33.638
I think they should have
taken that fiddle, right,

75
00:08:33.672 --> 00:08:35.974
and then cracked it
over the woman's head,

76
00:08:37.042 --> 00:08:38.843
and used the wood for kindling.

77
00:08:41.746 --> 00:08:43.348
Don't tell me what you deserve.

78
00:08:45.016 --> 00:08:46.016
Page 85.

79
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.195
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.

80
00:10:05.229 --> 00:10:07.631
Oh, it's cool.

81
00:10:07.664 --> 00:10:08.832
You all right?

82
00:10:08.866 --> 00:10:10.435
Yeah.

83
00:10:10.468 --> 00:10:12.345
Just wanted to commend you
on your work at the board.

84
00:10:12.369 --> 00:10:14.905
I put you on the spot, but
I knew you could handle it.

85
00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:17.975
Thanks.

86
00:10:19.977 --> 00:10:22.179
You never have to feel

87
00:10:22.212 --> 00:10:24.248
ashamed of your talents, Jane.

88
00:10:36.193 --> 00:10:37.895
You like him, don't you?

89
00:10:40.498 --> 00:10:41.498
Who?

90
00:10:43.067 --> 00:10:44.068
You know!

91
00:10:47.604 --> 00:10:48.604
Ellis?

92
00:10:50.307 --> 00:10:51.307
No.

93
00:10:52.709 --> 00:10:55.579
I mean, he does have that
bad Daddy thing going on.

94
00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.118
Wait, Aunspach?

95
00:11:03.187 --> 00:11:07.790
Why else would you show
off like that in class, hmm?

96
00:11:08.724 --> 00:11:10.726
Merritt, no, I was...

97
00:11:12.862 --> 00:11:15.631
He was like pressuring me-

98
00:11:15.665 --> 00:11:17.534
- Oh, shut up, you loved it.

99
00:11:19.735 --> 00:11:23.540
I mean, okay, yeah,
it's math, it's whatever.

100
00:11:25.007 --> 00:11:28.878
I really didn't do the
reading or anything, I swear.

101
00:11:28.911 --> 00:11:29.812
I didn't wanna go up there,

102
00:11:29.846 --> 00:11:30.956
but it was like I
couldn't say no.

103
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.450
So tell him to stop.

104
00:11:33.484 --> 00:11:34.784
Go after school today.

105
00:11:36.953 --> 00:11:37.987
You think I should?

106
00:11:39.423 --> 00:11:43.025
Janey, the man's got a
hard-on for your derivatives.

107
00:11:43.059 --> 00:11:47.763
You could get him to do anything,
even get us that retake.

108
00:11:52.603 --> 00:11:54.937
Is Cathy really gonna
go that ballistic on you?

109
00:11:56.973 --> 00:11:59.510
Your mom was not
like mine, remember?

110
00:12:02.945 --> 00:12:05.415
Cathy said if I don't
get into Princeton,

111
00:12:05.449 --> 00:12:09.352
like every other Sinclair
since the birth of Christ,

112
00:12:09.385 --> 00:12:11.522
I won't see a dime
from my trust fund.

113
00:12:12.889 --> 00:12:13.890
What?

114
00:12:15.324 --> 00:12:17.160
Half the admissions board drools

115
00:12:17.193 --> 00:12:19.262
over her tits at the club,

116
00:12:19.295 --> 00:12:20.663
but I doubt even they'll ignore

117
00:12:20.696 --> 00:12:22.665
the grades Aunspach's
shitting out.

118
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.969
"Aren't these turds just the
pride of the family, Merritt?"

119
00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:29.972
She said that to you?

120
00:12:31.207 --> 00:12:33.309
So, you'll talk to him.

121
00:12:41.017 --> 00:12:42.017
Yeah, yeah.

122
00:12:46.923 --> 00:12:48.024
Love you, Janey.

123
00:12:49.959 --> 00:12:51.027
I love you, too.

124
00:12:56.199 --> 00:12:57.300
One more thing.

125
00:12:57.333 --> 00:12:58.834
Yep?

126
00:12:58.868 --> 00:13:01.003
Never make me look
like an asshole again.

127
00:13:08.244 --> 00:13:09.244
Next.

128
00:13:10.546 --> 00:13:12.648
Pops, I'm doomed if
Brody gets more than four.

129
00:13:12.682 --> 00:13:14.684
No way these bis and
tris pump out five.

130
00:13:17.118 --> 00:13:18.397
- That's one.
- Just be yourself, son.

131
00:13:18.421 --> 00:13:19.287
That's two.

132
00:13:19.321 --> 00:13:20.364
But, Dad, if he's
more jacked than me-

133
00:13:20.388 --> 00:13:21.457
- That's three.

134
00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:23.134
Rakowski's gonna give him
the mascot gig for sure.

135
00:13:23.158 --> 00:13:24.192
Four.

136
00:13:24.226 --> 00:13:26.194
Stop him, Dad.

137
00:13:26.228 --> 00:13:27.228
Five.

138
00:13:32.668 --> 00:13:34.736
Boom, Brody's so lit!

139
00:13:35.705 --> 00:13:37.138
- All right, all right.
- Shut up.

140
00:13:39.107 --> 00:13:40.208
Miller.

141
00:13:41.843 --> 00:13:44.246
Does anyone actually know
what's in Rakowski's mug?

142
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:46.780
Whisky.

143
00:13:49.217 --> 00:13:50.952
French.

144
00:13:50.986 --> 00:13:52.854
Don't fail me now, testosterone.

145
00:13:54.624 --> 00:13:56.124
Go wreck 'em, Frenchy boy.

146
00:14:01.896 --> 00:14:03.898
Whisky, really?

147
00:14:03.932 --> 00:14:07.202
Brody said he saw eight
bottles in her desk drawer.

148
00:14:07.235 --> 00:14:09.904
Then he invited me
to his hot tub again.

149
00:14:09.938 --> 00:14:11.172
Eight bottles?

150
00:14:11.206 --> 00:14:13.908
We gotta raid,
like this weekend.

151
00:14:13.942 --> 00:14:16.177
Yeah, can't.

152
00:14:16.211 --> 00:14:18.947
I can do it, I can do it.

153
00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.115
I can do it!

154
00:14:20.148 --> 00:14:21.383
Why can't you?

155
00:14:21.417 --> 00:14:24.119
Because once Cathy
sees my calculus test,

156
00:14:24.152 --> 00:14:27.188
she's gonna nail my labia
to the dining room floor.

157
00:14:27.222 --> 00:14:28.624
I can do it!

158
00:14:28.658 --> 00:14:31.359
No, I can't.

159
00:14:31.393 --> 00:14:34.630
Hey, when I was your age,
I could do 15 of those,

160
00:14:34.664 --> 00:14:36.699
and I had carpal
tunnel in both wrists.

161
00:14:36.732 --> 00:14:37.732
Get up.

162
00:14:39.134 --> 00:14:40.703
I can't, I can't.

163
00:14:43.938 --> 00:14:45.140
Boo!

164
00:14:49.645 --> 00:14:51.079
Jane, you almost got a pull-up.

165
00:14:51.112 --> 00:14:52.914
What's your secret sauce?

166
00:14:52.947 --> 00:14:54.949
God, the wifi here is such shit.

167
00:14:54.983 --> 00:14:58.119
Well, it's all about leverage,
as well as strength, right?

168
00:14:59.455 --> 00:15:01.256
It's not about bis and tris?

169
00:15:03.058 --> 00:15:07.095
Okay, so your latissimus
dorsi, your lats,

170
00:15:07.128 --> 00:15:08.129
they're actually-

171
00:15:08.163 --> 00:15:09.765
- Have you blown Aunspach?

172
00:15:11.199 --> 00:15:12.199
What?

173
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:16.403
She hasn't blown him.

174
00:15:17.871 --> 00:15:18.871
Maybe you should.

175
00:15:20.007 --> 00:15:21.051
Take the edge off
him and make him

176
00:15:21.075 --> 00:15:23.778
less of a walking human penis.

177
00:15:26.213 --> 00:15:27.214
What?

178
00:15:30.184 --> 00:15:31.185
Geez, dude.

179
00:15:32.853 --> 00:15:34.321
Kinda cuts like chicken.

180
00:15:34.355 --> 00:15:36.190
Ew!

181
00:15:36.223 --> 00:15:37.191
Nice!

182
00:15:37.224 --> 00:15:39.259
Oh my god!

183
00:15:39.293 --> 00:15:41.895
Since when do you
care about your grades?

184
00:15:41.929 --> 00:15:44.833
Since I need a 3.0
to stay on the team.

185
00:15:44.865 --> 00:15:47.368
Oh, the team, the team.

186
00:15:47.401 --> 00:15:49.970
Don't act like you
don't care, pinko.

187
00:15:50.003 --> 00:15:51.740
Douche-box's work is
beyond college level,

188
00:15:51.773 --> 00:15:54.208
but now we have to do
it because she can.

189
00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:57.712
Erik's right, this is bullshit.

190
00:15:57.746 --> 00:16:00.981
Shipley, I swear to
God, if I can't play

191
00:16:01.014 --> 00:16:03.183
next Friday because of math,

192
00:16:03.217 --> 00:16:05.953
I will microwave
your TV dinner ass.

193
00:16:08.155 --> 00:16:09.491
Ew!

194
00:16:14.529 --> 00:16:18.132
I really didn't study
or do the reading.

195
00:16:20.234 --> 00:16:21.235
I swear.

196
00:16:22.269 --> 00:16:24.104
It's fine, no one
should give a shit,

197
00:16:24.138 --> 00:16:26.306
so can we stop
talking about school,

198
00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.711
and put our considerable
free-thinking brains to good use?

199
00:16:29.744 --> 00:16:32.079
Like raiding Rakowski's
whisky stash.

200
00:16:32.112 --> 00:16:33.715
Rakowski's got a whisky stash?

201
00:16:33.748 --> 00:16:35.315
Son, Father will provide.

202
00:16:37.084 --> 00:16:38.753
Thanks, Pops.

203
00:16:38.787 --> 00:16:41.321
So raid on Friday night
before Brody gets here first?

204
00:16:41.355 --> 00:16:42.355
Yeah, I'm down.

205
00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:45.427
Well, what about
the new cameras?

206
00:16:46.393 --> 00:16:47.928
What new cameras?

207
00:16:52.132 --> 00:16:53.132
Those fascists.

208
00:16:54.234 --> 00:16:55.613
It doesn't matter,
we'll get around them.

209
00:16:55.637 --> 00:16:57.237
Friday night it is.

210
00:16:57.271 --> 00:16:58.440
Ellis, do you recall

211
00:16:58.473 --> 00:17:00.407
what Cathy said
about my genitals?

212
00:17:00.442 --> 00:17:02.142
Okay, so sneak out.

213
00:17:02.176 --> 00:17:03.778
The athletic wing will be open.

214
00:17:04.679 --> 00:17:05.979
It's Nadia's home game.

215
00:17:06.013 --> 00:17:07.449
If I play.

216
00:17:07.482 --> 00:17:09.684
Hey, Hoover, why'd you
fuck me at practice

217
00:17:09.717 --> 00:17:11.385
- the other day?
- Where is she going?

218
00:17:11.419 --> 00:17:13.086
Oh, this is gonna be good.

219
00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.622
I can't even.

220
00:17:14.656 --> 00:17:16.790
How are we gonna get
around the security cameras

221
00:17:16.824 --> 00:17:18.357
on every single corner?

222
00:17:18.391 --> 00:17:19.860
Wow, that was violent.

223
00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.161
You can hack them.

224
00:17:23.597 --> 00:17:25.064
You can?

225
00:17:25.097 --> 00:17:26.332
Is no one else seeing this?

226
00:17:26.365 --> 00:17:30.036
Well, I only know
the theory, but, yeah.

227
00:17:31.337 --> 00:17:32.473
Damn.

228
00:17:32.506 --> 00:17:34.875
Coach should probably
be seeing this.

229
00:17:34.908 --> 00:17:36.976
Cool, awesome, we'll do it.

230
00:17:38.344 --> 00:17:39.413
She might kill her, guys.

231
00:17:39.446 --> 00:17:42.014
Nadi, for shit's
sake, put her down.

232
00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:43.850
Raid!

233
00:17:44.618 --> 00:17:45.618
Nadi.

234
00:17:46.219 --> 00:17:47.454
Nadi, just get off her.

235
00:18:04.003 --> 00:18:05.304
Attention, students,

236
00:18:05.338 --> 00:18:07.106
as a reminder, flight
school and drama club

237
00:18:07.139 --> 00:18:09.610
are canceled this afternoon
for the installation

238
00:18:09.643 --> 00:18:12.412
of polycore security windows.

239
00:18:12.446 --> 00:18:15.415
Also, please, be aware
that the new security gate

240
00:18:15.449 --> 00:18:17.584
will be activated in 20 minutes.

241
00:18:31.565 --> 00:18:32.565
Hello?

242
00:19:06.433 --> 00:19:07.434
Hi.

243
00:19:09.101 --> 00:19:10.537
- Hi.
- Jane, good to see ya.

244
00:19:17.711 --> 00:19:20.813
So I wanted to ask
you about that retake.

245
00:19:32.357 --> 00:19:33.726
Look, Mr. Aunspach.

246
00:19:38.598 --> 00:19:41.534
Mr. Aunspach, did you hear me?

247
00:19:41.567 --> 00:19:44.302
You ever feel like you're
living in the wrong time?

248
00:19:45.438 --> 00:19:47.573
Like someone mixed up
when you were born?

249
00:19:49.442 --> 00:19:50.776
Um-

250
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:54.112
- I always thought I should
be on the great frontier,

251
00:19:55.246 --> 00:19:57.683
back when the railroads
were being built,

252
00:19:57.717 --> 00:20:01.487
when there were new
towns, cities, sheriffs.

253
00:20:03.489 --> 00:20:08.494
No plastics, no
screens, no wifi.

254
00:20:11.129 --> 00:20:15.901
Like our mascot, Anvil Al,
working with his tools,

255
00:20:15.935 --> 00:20:18.269
forging things of
substance, potential.

256
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.442
I mean, I always thought
he looked kind of silly,

257
00:20:25.111 --> 00:20:28.447
you know, with all that hair.

258
00:20:28.481 --> 00:20:29.481
Number nine.

259
00:20:31.684 --> 00:20:33.318
You got it wrong on your test.

260
00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:37.490
Oh, yeah, I must've-

261
00:20:37.523 --> 00:20:41.460
- It's odd to me because,
given your understanding

262
00:20:41.494 --> 00:20:44.162
of the concepts, I don't
see why that 96 wasn't 100.

263
00:20:46.766 --> 00:20:50.002
Well, there's been a lot
to study for the semester.

264
00:20:51.437 --> 00:20:52.505
How long did you study?

265
00:20:55.474 --> 00:20:56.642
Hours?

266
00:20:56.676 --> 00:20:58.209
- I'm not sure.
- Not at all?

267
00:20:58.243 --> 00:21:00.245
No, no, I did study, and-

268
00:21:00.278 --> 00:21:01.714
- Don't lie.

269
00:21:01.747 --> 00:21:03.716
I see how you are in my class.

270
00:21:03.749 --> 00:21:06.519
You don't listen,
you don't take notes.

271
00:21:07.553 --> 00:21:09.155
It's because of them, isn't it?

272
00:21:09.187 --> 00:21:10.856
Because of what they'll think.

273
00:21:12.058 --> 00:21:15.661
I thought I told you,
don't feel ashamed.

274
00:21:15.695 --> 00:21:18.864
No, no, I'm not ashamed,

275
00:21:18.898 --> 00:21:22.535
and I do listen, I
do take notes, I do.

276
00:21:24.334 --> 00:21:25.335
Hey, wait.

277
00:21:27.739 --> 00:21:28.739
Can you stop?

278
00:21:39.184 --> 00:21:43.154
Okay, so I'm
already doing better

279
00:21:43.188 --> 00:21:44.522
than everybody else here.

280
00:21:44.556 --> 00:21:47.158
Better than who,
a bunch of morons?

281
00:21:47.192 --> 00:21:50.495
There are two kinds
of people, Jane.

282
00:21:50.528 --> 00:21:52.731
Fiddle people, hammer people.

283
00:21:52.764 --> 00:21:55.232
Fiddle people, they can't
build, they can't make.

284
00:21:55.265 --> 00:21:57.367
They play, they drive
their convertibles,

285
00:21:57.401 --> 00:22:01.305
and then, after a while, summer
ends, and what happens then?

286
00:22:01.338 --> 00:22:03.475
They take from
the hammer people,

287
00:22:03.508 --> 00:22:05.152
the people that have been
working month after month,

288
00:22:05.176 --> 00:22:06.578
who don't trash their gifts.

289
00:22:06.611 --> 00:22:08.847
They use them to make things.

290
00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.915
Fiddle people, hammer people,

291
00:22:10.949 --> 00:22:14.552
and it's my job to make
you pick up the hammer.

292
00:22:15.787 --> 00:22:17.698
But all I see is you hanging
out with the fiddlers,

293
00:22:17.722 --> 00:22:20.892
trying to get them to like
you, and you know what?

294
00:22:20.925 --> 00:22:22.894
It's not cute, Jane.

295
00:22:22.927 --> 00:22:23.927
It's pathetic.

296
00:22:26.197 --> 00:22:28.398
This, this is a waste.

297
00:22:29.299 --> 00:22:31.770
They are a waste.

298
00:22:31.803 --> 00:22:35.473
That, that is a gift.

299
00:22:37.075 --> 00:22:38.610
Don't you dare throw it away.

300
00:22:57.729 --> 00:22:58.729
Okay.

301
00:23:11.776 --> 00:23:13.077
Fuck you!

302
00:23:53.517 --> 00:23:55.485
Hey, Merritt.

303
00:24:43.333 --> 00:24:45.235
Do you think he'll do something?

304
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:46.269
Sure.

305
00:24:51.575 --> 00:24:52.876
Okay, but I really don't want

306
00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:54.087
to make it a big deal, Merritt.

307
00:24:54.111 --> 00:24:56.079
Really, really,
'cause I just wanna

308
00:24:56.113 --> 00:24:58.382
tell what happened,
and maybe he'll talk

309
00:24:58.415 --> 00:25:00.460
to him about it and that's
it, and then we can go, so.

310
00:25:00.484 --> 00:25:01.484
Jane.

311
00:25:02.119 --> 00:25:03.220
Chill your clit.

312
00:25:07.391 --> 00:25:08.458
Ladies.

313
00:25:18.702 --> 00:25:19.903
Mr. Lawson.

314
00:25:21.305 --> 00:25:22.706
So, you approached him-

315
00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:28.278
- Oh, no, no, no,
he approached me.

316
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:33.449
And he grabbed my backpack,
he took out my notebook,

317
00:25:33.482 --> 00:25:35.117
and he get got really angry.

318
00:25:35.151 --> 00:25:37.119
So he was angry
you had a notebook?

319
00:25:39.488 --> 00:25:41.891
No, he was mad that the
notebook had drawings in it.

320
00:25:41.924 --> 00:25:44.794
So your calculus notebook
was full of drawings?

321
00:25:46.629 --> 00:25:48.631
That's not the point.

322
00:25:49.966 --> 00:25:54.337
He got really close to me,
and he got really angry.

323
00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:56.272
Angry you weren't
applying yourself.

324
00:25:57.273 --> 00:25:58.774
Yeah, makes sense to me.

325
00:25:58.808 --> 00:26:01.277
Sir, this isn't the first time

326
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:04.814
I felt really
uncomfortable around him,

327
00:26:06.349 --> 00:26:07.783
but this time he did more.

328
00:26:07.817 --> 00:26:11.754
He reached out at me and
grabbed me and shook me-

329
00:26:11.787 --> 00:26:14.657
- Do you prefer to
always feel comfortable,

330
00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:17.827
never be told how to
improve, how to get better?

331
00:26:19.895 --> 00:26:21.297
That's not what I'm saying.

332
00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:23.833
That's what a good
teacher does, Miss Shipley.

333
00:26:24.967 --> 00:26:26.135
I understand, but this-

334
00:26:26.168 --> 00:26:27.768
- I don't like how
this is being handled.

335
00:26:32.008 --> 00:26:33.175
I'm sorry?

336
00:26:33.209 --> 00:26:34.777
And, more importantly,
I don't think

337
00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:36.379
my father would, either.

338
00:26:41.017 --> 00:26:42.184
Miss Sinclair-

339
00:26:42.218 --> 00:26:44.954
- Mr. Lawson, the
school board's opinion

340
00:26:44.987 --> 00:26:47.356
does matter to you, doesn't it?

341
00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:49.825
How much do your wife's
medical bills run a month?

342
00:26:55.064 --> 00:26:56.532
Let's try this again.

343
00:26:56.565 --> 00:26:59.001
And this time, you'll
let Jane finish,

344
00:26:59.035 --> 00:27:01.037
and, when she does, you'll think

345
00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:02.938
very hard about that opinion

346
00:27:02.972 --> 00:27:06.075
and exactly what you'll do
with your staff to preserve it.

347
00:27:17.686 --> 00:27:18.686
Go on.

348
00:27:26.695 --> 00:27:28.064
Mr. Aunspach.

349
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.101
Mr. Aunspach.

350
00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:47.982
Wow, what a nail-biter, folks.

351
00:27:48.016 --> 00:27:49.350
Let's go, Anvils!

352
00:27:49.384 --> 00:27:50.985
We're all tied up.

353
00:27:51.019 --> 00:27:53.489
With only minutes left in
penalty for either team

354
00:27:53.522 --> 00:27:55.623
to seal the deal.

355
00:27:55.657 --> 00:27:57.258
Today's game has
been brought to you

356
00:27:57.292 --> 00:28:00.895
by Paul's Polycore
Security Glass.

357
00:28:00.929 --> 00:28:03.298
Here comes Paul
himself for a test.

358
00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:10.939
Look, folks, not even
Anvil Al can break

359
00:28:10.972 --> 00:28:13.274
the patented polycore pane.

360
00:28:13.308 --> 00:28:15.743
Yeah, that's right,
Brody can't even break it!

361
00:28:15.777 --> 00:28:16.678
Boo!

362
00:28:16.711 --> 00:28:18.713
Brody sucks, Brody sucks!

363
00:28:18.746 --> 00:28:21.082
Paul's
Polycore, protecting property,

364
00:28:21.116 --> 00:28:22.518
protecting people.

365
00:28:22.551 --> 00:28:23.885
Go, Nadia, woo!

366
00:28:25.086 --> 00:28:27.889
I hate you, Brody, I hate you!

367
00:28:27.922 --> 00:28:29.492
Hey, look who's over there.

368
00:28:29.525 --> 00:28:32.327
Hey, Miss Rakowski, you
picked the wrong mascot.

369
00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.896
You made the biggest
mistake of your entire life!

370
00:28:34.929 --> 00:28:36.073
Sure told her, didn't I, Dad?

371
00:28:36.097 --> 00:28:37.566
I'm proud of you, son.

372
00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.033
And, now, back to the field.

373
00:28:39.067 --> 00:28:40.067
Let's go!

374
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:42.871
What if he does something?

375
00:28:42.904 --> 00:28:43.905
He won't.

376
00:28:44.939 --> 00:28:45.939
Why not?

377
00:28:46.841 --> 00:28:49.043
Stop freaking
your shit and think.

378
00:28:49.077 --> 00:28:50.912
Why do you think the
school kept it quiet?

379
00:28:50.945 --> 00:28:53.848
He leaves, no one talks,
neither side gets screwed.

380
00:28:55.016 --> 00:28:56.818
Parker receives the pass.

381
00:28:57.986 --> 00:28:58.953
Now it's this whole thing.

382
00:28:58.987 --> 00:29:00.155
Parker's got the ball.

383
00:29:00.188 --> 00:29:01.289
You got it, Nadi!

384
00:29:01.322 --> 00:29:02.666
And I told you I didn't
want anyone to know.

385
00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:03.958
Oh, shut up!

386
00:29:03.992 --> 00:29:05.960
You won't ever see him again.

387
00:29:05.994 --> 00:29:06.995
Parker's still going.

388
00:29:07.028 --> 00:29:08.196
But that's not what I wanted.

389
00:29:08.229 --> 00:29:10.899
Jane, do you really
think men lay off

390
00:29:10.932 --> 00:29:12.200
because you ask them nicely?

391
00:29:14.969 --> 00:29:17.172
Anvils lose control.

392
00:29:18.373 --> 00:29:20.175
Grow a uterus.

393
00:29:20.208 --> 00:29:23.111
Come on, Nadi!

394
00:29:23.144 --> 00:29:25.213
Williams gets the ball.

395
00:29:25.246 --> 00:29:26.246
Goddamn it!

396
00:29:28.016 --> 00:29:32.120
Williams shoots and she scores!

397
00:29:32.153 --> 00:29:34.889
Point goes to the Eagles.

398
00:29:34.923 --> 00:29:36.000
And that's the game, folks.

399
00:29:36.024 --> 00:29:38.358
The Eagles take
it over the Anvils

400
00:29:38.392 --> 00:29:40.294
in a nail-biting
four to three finish.

401
00:29:41.995 --> 00:29:43.206
The Anvils would like
to thank everybody

402
00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:45.899
for coming out to
witness this final game

403
00:29:45.933 --> 00:29:48.101
between the Eagles
and the Anvils.

404
00:29:55.943 --> 00:29:57.579
And that Polycore Pane.

405
00:29:57.612 --> 00:30:00.113
Paul's Polycore Security Glass.

406
00:30:01.315 --> 00:30:02.883
And, while you're
there, don't forget

407
00:30:02.916 --> 00:30:06.521
to take a selfie with Paul's
Polycore Security Camera.

408
00:30:12.759 --> 00:30:14.596
- Why don't you fuck off,
- Brody?

409
00:30:14.629 --> 00:30:15.697
Oh, shit.

410
00:30:15.729 --> 00:30:17.030
- Hey!
- Yo, get off her,

411
00:30:17.064 --> 00:30:19.099
- you piece of shit!
- French, French!

412
00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.074
No, don't do this.

413
00:30:27.107 --> 00:30:29.544
It's not covering enough.

414
00:30:29.577 --> 00:30:30.877
Ow!

415
00:30:30.911 --> 00:30:33.080
This is more me than you.

416
00:30:35.115 --> 00:30:36.684
Dude, I'm pretty sure he grew

417
00:30:36.718 --> 00:30:38.085
facial hair in fourth grade.

418
00:30:38.118 --> 00:30:39.853
No, I mean like
he's obviously on steroids.

419
00:30:39.886 --> 00:30:41.788
No one can just
do five pull-ups.

420
00:30:41.822 --> 00:30:44.191
He's been held back
like four times.

421
00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:21.962
- Just go.
- Shut up.

422
00:31:23.263 --> 00:31:24.965
Ah, Rakowski's lair.

423
00:31:26.166 --> 00:31:27.968
Smells like I always
dreamed it would.

424
00:31:28.001 --> 00:31:31.204
People hide their spares
in the most pathetic places.

425
00:31:31.238 --> 00:31:32.806
Found this in
about five seconds.

426
00:31:33.775 --> 00:31:34.975
Where's the goods?

427
00:31:35.008 --> 00:31:36.477
Brody said the
bottom right drawer.

428
00:31:36.511 --> 00:31:38.145
Do we trust that maniac?

429
00:31:38.178 --> 00:31:40.112
He's obsessed
with me, it's fine.

430
00:31:41.347 --> 00:31:43.349
Security initiative, my ass.

431
00:31:44.283 --> 00:31:45.951
The janitor gave me the code.

432
00:31:45.985 --> 00:31:47.219
Traded it for a bag of weed.

433
00:33:00.226 --> 00:33:03.195
What in the name of Paul Bunyan?

434
00:33:04.498 --> 00:33:08.200
Dad, remind me to never make
the Rakowskinator angry again.

435
00:33:08.234 --> 00:33:09.436
She has an ax.

436
00:33:10.437 --> 00:33:12.672
Teachers are messed up, son.

437
00:33:12.706 --> 00:33:13.874
Think about it.

438
00:33:13.906 --> 00:33:15.207
We see them all day,

439
00:33:15.241 --> 00:33:16.801
we're trapped inside
a school with them,

440
00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:19.121
with no idea where
they came from,

441
00:33:19.145 --> 00:33:21.113
what they were doing
before class, or after.

442
00:33:21.981 --> 00:33:23.382
Could be into all kinds of shit.

443
00:33:23.417 --> 00:33:25.485
Like sock puppets, dude.

444
00:33:25.519 --> 00:33:26.887
The kind of power that they have

445
00:33:26.919 --> 00:33:30.256
and the things that they
can do and say to us

446
00:33:30.289 --> 00:33:33.125
that'll mess with us for
the rest of our lives.

447
00:33:35.294 --> 00:33:39.031
It's just scary.

448
00:33:40.567 --> 00:33:42.234
I'm all for that
Miss Taylor, though.

449
00:33:42.268 --> 00:33:45.604
She can sub in for Aunspach's
class any day that she wants.

450
00:33:45.638 --> 00:33:47.807
That babushka is spicy.

451
00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:48.741
Anyone would've beaten

452
00:33:48.774 --> 00:33:50.308
the Aunspachian autocracy.

453
00:33:52.243 --> 00:33:54.212
Whoa, guys, guys!

454
00:33:54.245 --> 00:33:55.346
I found Rakowski's diary.

455
00:33:57.148 --> 00:33:59.317
- Shit, really?
- Yeah.

456
00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:00.118
What's it say?

457
00:34:00.151 --> 00:34:01.787
Whoa, whoa.

458
00:34:01.821 --> 00:34:03.288
She really does not like us.

459
00:34:05.023 --> 00:34:07.493
Oh, shit, our gym
teacher's messed up.

460
00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.161
What the fuck is this?

461
00:34:12.765 --> 00:34:14.098
Boo.

462
00:34:14.132 --> 00:34:15.166
Real mature.

463
00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:17.035
You screamed so loud.

464
00:34:17.068 --> 00:34:19.103
French, for you, buddy.

465
00:34:19.939 --> 00:34:21.172
Cool.

466
00:34:21.206 --> 00:34:23.074
Wait, shouldn't
Jane be back by now?

467
00:34:23.107 --> 00:34:24.443
Just open the drawer.

468
00:34:24.477 --> 00:34:25.511
Yes, master.

469
00:34:33.284 --> 00:34:34.285
Shit.

470
00:34:35.788 --> 00:34:38.624
I will wear his
intestines as a necklace.

471
00:36:18.523 --> 00:36:20.357
400,000.

472
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:21.559
Okay.

473
00:36:21.593 --> 00:36:22.593
300,000.

474
00:36:23.695 --> 00:36:25.730
Okay.

475
00:36:25.763 --> 00:36:26.763
250?

476
00:36:29.968 --> 00:36:30.968
No?

477
00:36:31.703 --> 00:36:33.004
It's Mr. Gibbons, Nadia.

478
00:36:33.037 --> 00:36:35.506
Okay, for a quarter
of a million dollars,

479
00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:37.408
you wouldn't eat your cat?

480
00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:41.278
Actually, no, no, no, no!

481
00:36:42.447 --> 00:36:44.015
Dad, she's being mean.

482
00:36:44.048 --> 00:36:46.248
Son, you're gonna eat your
cat and you're gonna like it.

483
00:36:53.091 --> 00:36:54.091
Whoa, sailor.

484
00:36:57.061 --> 00:36:58.630
I've got one.

485
00:36:58.663 --> 00:37:02.634
The lowest price to kill the
person you hate the most.

486
00:37:02.667 --> 00:37:04.602
Coach Ramirez, 10 grand.

487
00:37:04.636 --> 00:37:05.636
Brody!

488
00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:11.476
Frenchy, how much have you had?

489
00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:14.579
One.

490
00:37:14.612 --> 00:37:15.345
One what?

491
00:37:15.379 --> 00:37:16.648
Just one.

492
00:37:16.681 --> 00:37:18.616
Okay, Nadi, don't worry about

493
00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:22.252
Coach Senora Ramirez or anybody.

494
00:37:22.285 --> 00:37:24.555
You played wonderfully tonight.

495
00:37:24.589 --> 00:37:27.157
Truly.

496
00:37:28.826 --> 00:37:31.696
Okay, Merritt,
who's your target?

497
00:37:34.832 --> 00:37:37.535
Cathy, 30 grand.

498
00:37:38.436 --> 00:37:39.436
20?

499
00:37:40.538 --> 00:37:42.073
Sure.

500
00:37:42.106 --> 00:37:43.408
I am sad.

501
00:37:43.441 --> 00:37:45.710
Your mom, that's
pretty messed up.

502
00:37:47.578 --> 00:37:48.680
You don't know her.

503
00:37:50.048 --> 00:37:51.581
A sad little function.

504
00:37:54.951 --> 00:37:55.951
What about you?

505
00:37:57.487 --> 00:37:58.922
The president.

506
00:37:58.955 --> 00:38:01.525
The current president?

507
00:38:01.558 --> 00:38:04.193
Any president,
they're all tyrants.

508
00:38:04.226 --> 00:38:05.226
Fucking mascot.

509
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:08.699
- Brody's the fucking mascot.
- Okay, um-

510
00:38:08.732 --> 00:38:11.300
- Sic temper tyrannis, Shipley.

511
00:38:12.469 --> 00:38:14.438
Look, the people
who think they know

512
00:38:14.471 --> 00:38:16.740
better than everybody else
about how they should live

513
00:38:16.773 --> 00:38:20.209
their lives, and then force
them to live it their way,

514
00:38:20.242 --> 00:38:22.479
no one should be
able to do that.

515
00:38:22.512 --> 00:38:25.816
Those people need to be
destroyed, whatever the cost.

516
00:38:25.849 --> 00:38:26.950
Even if it's blood.

517
00:38:28.652 --> 00:38:30.520
Blah, blah, blah,
the government.

518
00:38:30.554 --> 00:38:31.988
Blah, blah, blah, tyranny.

519
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:34.858
That's all you ever talk about.

520
00:38:34.891 --> 00:38:36.493
It's so boring.

521
00:38:38.028 --> 00:38:39.563
Don't let him fool you.

522
00:38:39.596 --> 00:38:41.574
He's just pissed at his
parents like the rest of us.

523
00:38:41.598 --> 00:38:43.200
What song should I sing?

524
00:38:43.232 --> 00:38:44.134
What?

525
00:38:44.167 --> 00:38:45.869
You don't agree with me?

526
00:38:45.902 --> 00:38:46.902
I can't think.

527
00:38:50.207 --> 00:38:55.212
I always think there's
always a peaceful solution.

528
00:38:57.614 --> 00:38:58.614
Always?

529
00:38:59.381 --> 00:39:01.051
You really believe that?

530
00:39:01.084 --> 00:39:01.885
Don't know.

531
00:39:01.918 --> 00:39:03.487
Yeah, I guess.

532
00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.555
- Bullshit.
- Oh, I had it.

533
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:09.960
Even you would kill somebody
if they did enough to you.

534
00:39:15.398 --> 00:39:17.033
- No.
- Oh, please.

535
00:39:18.468 --> 00:39:20.369
I don't think I would.

536
00:39:20.403 --> 00:39:21.403
Why not?

537
00:39:24.941 --> 00:39:29.646
'Cause then I'd feel guilty,

538
00:39:29.679 --> 00:39:33.483
and I hate feeling that way.

539
00:39:34.818 --> 00:39:37.087
What has your shiny
ass possibly done

540
00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.755
to feel guilty about?

541
00:39:43.126 --> 00:39:44.126
I don't.

542
00:39:45.462 --> 00:39:48.532
Looks like little
Janey has a little secret.

543
00:39:48.565 --> 00:39:49.800
No.

544
00:39:49.833 --> 00:39:51.501
Come on, you can tell us.

545
00:39:53.669 --> 00:39:54.537
She doesn't wanna talk about it.

546
00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:55.638
Sure she does.

547
00:39:55.671 --> 00:39:57.606
- Stop.
- Spill, Shipley.

548
00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:58.641
Stop it.

549
00:39:58.674 --> 00:39:59.674
Spill.

550
00:40:01.844 --> 00:40:04.213
I have it, I have it.

551
00:40:04.246 --> 00:40:05.246
What?

552
00:40:07.249 --> 00:40:09.685
Lowest money to see
Miss Taylor's boobies.

553
00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:12.420
Zero dollars.

554
00:40:15.291 --> 00:40:16.291
Get up.

555
00:40:17.493 --> 00:40:18.627
What?

556
00:40:18.661 --> 00:40:19.662
That wasn't funny.

557
00:40:21.362 --> 00:40:22.362
No.

558
00:40:23.866 --> 00:40:25.333
Good one, Frenchy.

559
00:40:36.712 --> 00:40:38.280
Why didn't you stop her?

560
00:40:40.015 --> 00:40:41.450
Why didn't you?

561
00:40:44.653 --> 00:40:45.921
Look, I already told you,

562
00:40:45.955 --> 00:40:48.023
I don't want anyone
to know what happened,

563
00:40:48.057 --> 00:40:49.357
and you already made a-

564
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:50.669
- I already fixed
your problem for you

565
00:40:50.693 --> 00:40:52.133
because you couldn't
do that, either?

566
00:40:53.729 --> 00:40:54.729
What?

567
00:40:56.899 --> 00:40:58.834
You sound just like-

568
00:41:00.469 --> 00:41:01.537
- How do I sound like?

569
00:41:18.354 --> 00:41:20.856
If you could
kiss one animal, would you?

570
00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:22.291
A tiger.

571
00:41:46.849 --> 00:41:47.849
What?

572
00:41:49.184 --> 00:41:50.452
You know what.

573
00:41:50.486 --> 00:41:51.486
No, I don't.

574
00:41:53.923 --> 00:41:56.759
I have other options, you know.

575
00:41:56.792 --> 00:41:58.059
Brody practically stalks me.

576
00:41:59.627 --> 00:42:01.863
I'm sure the two of you
will be very happy together.

577
00:42:01.896 --> 00:42:02.896
He's a great guy.

578
00:42:04.599 --> 00:42:05.599
Excuse me?

579
00:42:06.434 --> 00:42:08.202
Merritt, we hooked up twice.

580
00:42:08.236 --> 00:42:10.104
It didn't even matter.

581
00:42:22.984 --> 00:42:24.218
Aunspach assaulted Jane.

582
00:42:24.252 --> 00:42:25.253
What?

583
00:42:25.286 --> 00:42:27.423
On Monday after class.

584
00:42:27.455 --> 00:42:28.957
Then they fired him.

585
00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:31.893
That's why we've had
Miss Taylor all week.

586
00:42:31.926 --> 00:42:32.926
Jesus!

587
00:42:34.462 --> 00:42:35.964
That total piece of shit.

588
00:42:35.997 --> 00:42:40.368
Yeah, I mean, she
probably won't wanna get

589
00:42:40.402 --> 00:42:42.438
with anyone for a
while after that, so.

590
00:42:44.272 --> 00:42:45.306
Thought you should know.

591
00:42:48.876 --> 00:42:50.078
You're a terrible friend.

592
00:42:51.346 --> 00:42:52.414
You know that?

593
00:42:54.816 --> 00:42:55.816
Fuck you.

594
00:43:14.202 --> 00:43:16.170
Dude, I can't
believe that shit happened.

595
00:43:16.204 --> 00:43:17.805
Yeah.

596
00:43:17.839 --> 00:43:20.008
He wasn't expecting me to
headbutt his fist like that.

597
00:43:21.342 --> 00:43:22.342
Does it hurt?

598
00:43:23.044 --> 00:43:24.645
This, oh, nah.

599
00:43:26.482 --> 00:43:28.816
You can touch it if you want.

600
00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:31.119
Okay, ow, don't, please,
don't touch it, actually.

601
00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:33.788
You're such an idiot.

602
00:43:45.166 --> 00:43:46.901
Miss Taylor's really
that hot, huh?

603
00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:50.004
Oh, yeah, she's crazy super hot.

604
00:43:53.741 --> 00:43:54.741
Awesome.

605
00:43:56.711 --> 00:43:57.711
What?

606
00:44:01.681 --> 00:44:02.681
Nothing.

607
00:44:03.683 --> 00:44:04.683
Go hump her blue.

608
00:44:06.853 --> 00:44:10.891
Nadia, you always
hide your cheesy sadness

609
00:44:10.924 --> 00:44:12.726
in a tortilla of rage.

610
00:44:12.759 --> 00:44:15.530
Now, tell me what's really
going on inside that burrito.

611
00:44:20.934 --> 00:44:23.504
You really don't know?

612
00:44:23.538 --> 00:44:25.205
Know what?

613
00:44:27.207 --> 00:44:29.709
I really have to tell you?

614
00:44:29.743 --> 00:44:31.412
Tell me what?

615
00:44:35.782 --> 00:44:39.586
Wait.

616
00:45:23.263 --> 00:45:24.263
Why Brody?

617
00:45:25.632 --> 00:45:26.632
Why not me?

618
00:45:28.068 --> 00:45:30.605
What's wrong with me?

619
00:45:38.145 --> 00:45:41.915
♪ I've been working
on the railroad ♪

620
00:45:41.948 --> 00:45:45.919

627

How am I supposed to do anything

628
00:46:12.178 --> 00:46:14.079
if I can't connect to anything?

629
00:46:18.184 --> 00:46:19.184
He'll be back.

630
00:46:21.488 --> 00:46:22.721
I'm gonna go check.

631
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:32.499
Frenchy, are you okay?

632
00:46:34.833 --> 00:46:35.833
French?

633
00:46:42.442 --> 00:46:43.442
He's fine.

634
00:46:45.077 --> 00:46:46.212
One time, he drank a keg.

635
00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:49.882
Shit, I lost my anklet.

636
00:46:50.916 --> 00:46:52.785
I think I left it in the pool.

637
00:46:53.653 --> 00:46:55.522
Let's go look for it.

638
00:46:55.555 --> 00:46:57.624
Okay, well, if
Cathy doesn't find me

639
00:46:57.657 --> 00:46:59.459
sitting at home
knitting a tea cozy,

640
00:46:59.492 --> 00:47:02.061
she'll stab my face,
so the car leaves now.

641
00:47:02.094 --> 00:47:03.630
Just give us a second, okay?

642
00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:06.165
Fine, fine.

643
00:47:20.246 --> 00:47:21.414
French?

644
00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:01.620
Hey.

645
00:48:03.022 --> 00:48:07.158
So, Merritt told me what
happened with Aunspach.

646
00:48:18.771 --> 00:48:19.771
She told you?

647
00:48:20.472 --> 00:48:22.340
She shouldn't have, I know.

648
00:48:34.252 --> 00:48:35.252
Are you...

649
00:48:36.488 --> 00:48:37.488
Shit.

650
00:48:43.061 --> 00:48:48.099
Look, I'm really sorry
that happened to you.

651
00:49:01.179 --> 00:49:02.179
Hey, guys.

652
00:49:07.051 --> 00:49:08.654
Nadi?

653
00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:13.525
Nadia.

654
00:49:18.397 --> 00:49:23.134
Nadia, what's going on?

655
00:49:23.167 --> 00:49:24.369
What's wrong?

656
00:49:24.403 --> 00:49:25.403
Nadia!

657
00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:29.842
Was it French?

658
00:49:29.874 --> 00:49:31.142
Is he in there?

659
00:49:31.175 --> 00:49:33.211
What the hell happened?

660
00:49:33.244 --> 00:49:34.680
- Is he sick?
- I don't-

661
00:49:34.713 --> 00:49:35.913
- You don't what?

662
00:49:35.947 --> 00:49:37.949
Okay, do we need to pump
his stomach or what?

663
00:49:39.551 --> 00:49:40.519
Ellis.

664
00:49:40.552 --> 00:49:41.352
What?

665
00:49:41.386 --> 00:49:42.387
Oh, for Christ's sake!

666
00:49:42.421 --> 00:49:43.789
What is going on?

667
00:49:44.922 --> 00:49:45.922
There's nothing!

668
00:49:46.958 --> 00:49:47.958
Ellis.

669
00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:49.660
French is,

670
00:49:50.729 --> 00:49:52.196
his head.

671
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:53.499
Jane, I need you

672
00:49:53.532 --> 00:49:55.834
to check your phone for
service, wifi, anything.

673
00:49:55.868 --> 00:49:56.735
Jane, please!

674
00:49:56.769 --> 00:49:57.870
We need to help him.

675
00:49:57.902 --> 00:49:58.737
I'm not getting anything.

676
00:49:58.771 --> 00:50:00.138
We have to go.

677
00:50:00.171 --> 00:50:01.407
No, not without French!

678
00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:02.841
- French is-
- No, he's not!

679
00:50:02.875 --> 00:50:04.942
Listen to me!

680
00:50:04.976 --> 00:50:08.414
Whatever did that to him
might still be in this school!

681
00:50:08.447 --> 00:50:09.347
We're not leaving without him!

682
00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:11.214
We can't reach anything!

683
00:50:11.248 --> 00:50:12.517
We're not leaving without him!

684
00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:13.751
- We have to!
- No!

685
00:50:19.457 --> 00:50:22.926
That's enough, we're leaving!

686
00:50:33.136 --> 00:50:34.171
Shit!

687
00:50:34.971 --> 00:50:35.740
What's that?

688
00:50:35.773 --> 00:50:36.773
- Brody.
- What?

689
00:50:37.575 --> 00:50:39.242
That goddamn freak.

690
00:50:39.276 --> 00:50:40.478
What the fuck is happening?

691
00:50:40.511 --> 00:50:41.813
The entire across the school.

692
00:50:41.846 --> 00:50:43.213
No, wait what about?

693
00:50:43.246 --> 00:50:44.449
Just go!

694
00:50:47.284 --> 00:50:48.453
I saw Brody.

695
00:50:48.486 --> 00:50:51.456
He was dressed up as
the stupid mascot,

696
00:50:51.489 --> 00:50:52.956
goddamn Anvil Al!

697
00:50:54.958 --> 00:50:59.129
How the hell do I break this
shit window so I can kill him?

698
00:50:59.162 --> 00:51:00.964
You can't, it's polycore.

699
00:51:00.997 --> 00:51:02.767
What the fuck does that mean?

700
00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.435
It's reinforced security glass,

701
00:51:04.469 --> 00:51:06.336
shatterproof, bulletproof.

702
00:51:06.369 --> 00:51:08.449
They set them up all over the
school with the new gates.

703
00:51:08.473 --> 00:51:09.607
And the new locks.

704
00:51:10.641 --> 00:51:11.676
Well, fuck!

705
00:51:12.844 --> 00:51:15.613
Okay, so we can't
get high school brains.

706
00:51:15.646 --> 00:51:17.247
We have to think.

707
00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:19.382
There's no service, no wifi.

708
00:51:19.417 --> 00:51:20.952
No fire alarms,
no fire detectors.

709
00:51:20.984 --> 00:51:22.219
I was gonna say that.

710
00:51:22.252 --> 00:51:23.119
And the landlines are down.

711
00:51:23.153 --> 00:51:25.088
Wait, what about the vents?

712
00:51:25.121 --> 00:51:26.121
We could use those.

713
00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:31.261
Do you really think you're
gonna fit in there, dickhead?

714
00:51:31.294 --> 00:51:32.506
And how would that actually
get us out of here?

715
00:51:32.530 --> 00:51:34.164
Where do you think we
are, Jurassic Park?

716
00:51:34.197 --> 00:51:35.341
Right, 'cause you're
just pouring forth

717
00:51:35.365 --> 00:51:37.334
such incredibly
intelligent strategies

718
00:51:37.367 --> 00:51:39.336
to get us out of here,
aren't you, Nadia?

719
00:51:39.369 --> 00:51:41.280
You just think you're so
fucking smart, don't you?

720
00:51:41.304 --> 00:51:42.850
You just think you're
above everybody else!

721
00:51:42.874 --> 00:51:44.207
Now is not-

722
00:51:44.241 --> 00:51:45.519
- Well, maybe you should
just bust down that wall

723
00:51:45.543 --> 00:51:47.086
over there with your
massive, chiseled biceps,

724
00:51:47.110 --> 00:51:48.412
like you always do?

725
00:51:48.446 --> 00:51:49.456
Why don't you just mind-blast it

726
00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:50.491
with your incredible
mental powers

727
00:51:50.515 --> 00:51:51.983
and masculine superiority?

728
00:51:52.015 --> 00:51:53.326
Yeah, well, maybe if
you didn't get French

729
00:51:53.350 --> 00:51:55.151
so fucked up, none of
this would've happened!

730
00:51:55.185 --> 00:51:57.287
Maybe if you didn't
fucking bring us here,

731
00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:58.321
he wouldn't be dead!

732
00:51:58.355 --> 00:51:59.757
Shut the fuck up!

733
00:52:03.093 --> 00:52:05.295
We don't know if all
the doors are locked.

734
00:52:05.328 --> 00:52:06.998
Maybe one isn't.

735
00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:08.833
It's midnight, so
the cleaning people,

736
00:52:08.866 --> 00:52:10.300
they come in on
Saturday's right?

737
00:52:10.333 --> 00:52:11.402
Not until eight.

738
00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:14.336
This is such bullshit.

739
00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:15.839
We're stuck inside of a school

740
00:52:15.872 --> 00:52:18.408
made of millions of dollars
of bulletproof glass,

741
00:52:18.441 --> 00:52:21.478
locks, and cameras, to what?

742
00:52:21.511 --> 00:52:23.145
To keep us safe?

743
00:52:25.582 --> 00:52:27.182
Screw this.

744
00:52:27.216 --> 00:52:30.085
Brody has to have a key, so
everybody grab something.

745
00:52:30.119 --> 00:52:32.889
We'll fuck him up, get
the keys, and get out.

746
00:52:32.923 --> 00:52:34.323
Wouldn't it be safer if we stay

747
00:52:34.356 --> 00:52:35.559
and just wait for janitors?

748
00:52:37.727 --> 00:52:41.063
If you wanna hide like a
rat, be my fucking guest.

749
00:52:41.096 --> 00:52:42.432
Ellis?

750
00:52:44.868 --> 00:52:46.268
Ellis!

751
00:52:49.472 --> 00:52:51.206
- Wait, okay-
- Can we reboot the security

752
00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:53.342
cameras to track where he is?

753
00:52:53.375 --> 00:52:55.177
I killed the
system for 12 hours.

754
00:52:55.210 --> 00:52:56.321
I didn't know how else to do it.

755
00:52:56.345 --> 00:52:57.345
Suck my tits.

756
00:52:59.616 --> 00:53:02.217
If we find an open
door, I'm taking it

757
00:53:02.251 --> 00:53:04.020
and driving the
hell out of here.

758
00:53:04.054 --> 00:53:06.590
I'm not revenging or
waiting for anyone.

759
00:53:06.623 --> 00:53:07.623
Got it?

760
00:53:10.393 --> 00:53:11.394
Well?

761
00:54:15.357 --> 00:54:16.357
Fuck.

762
00:54:46.155 --> 00:54:49.158
Oh, fuck!

763
00:55:55.591 --> 00:55:56.592
Fuck!

764
00:56:03.632 --> 00:56:05.534
Ellis, what?

765
00:56:05.567 --> 00:56:07.903
Let's go, come on,
come on, let's go.

766
00:56:07.936 --> 00:56:08.936
Nadia.

767
00:56:10.739 --> 00:56:12.407
What if it's not Brody?

768
00:56:12.441 --> 00:56:13.408
What if it's Rakowski?

769
00:56:13.442 --> 00:56:14.552
- What the fuck?
- Listen to me,

770
00:56:14.576 --> 00:56:16.612
Frenchy, he found
her diary earlier,

771
00:56:16.645 --> 00:56:18.113
and it said some
really weird shit.

772
00:56:18.147 --> 00:56:20.125
She's in charge of the
mascot, and she's into axes.

773
00:56:20.149 --> 00:56:21.149
Ellis, it's Brody.

774
00:56:22.784 --> 00:56:23.651
What if it's not?

775
00:56:23.684 --> 00:56:24.719
Guys, let's go.

776
00:56:26.654 --> 00:56:28.222
Nadia, I just want you to be-

777
00:56:28.256 --> 00:56:29.322
- What?

778
00:56:29.356 --> 00:56:30.356
Safe?

779
00:56:31.659 --> 00:56:32.660
Smart.

780
00:56:33.494 --> 00:56:36.197
Let's go, guys.

781
00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:40.601
Shit.

782
00:56:42.637 --> 00:56:46.474
Jane, do you
have a phone we can use?

783
00:56:46.507 --> 00:56:48.276
Hold on, I've
got something else.

784
00:56:48.308 --> 00:56:50.144
Hurry up, Jane!

785
00:57:48.536 --> 00:57:49.937
For God's sake.

786
00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:01.315
Shit!

787
00:58:03.885 --> 00:58:05.219
Merritt, wait.

788
00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:07.722
I found this note in my locker.

789
00:58:07.755 --> 00:58:10.491
Listen, I think, I really think

790
00:58:10.524 --> 00:58:12.593
it's not Rakowski or Brody.

791
00:58:13.527 --> 00:58:15.763
You need to stop.

792
00:58:15.796 --> 00:58:18.032
Merritt, he's the only
one who would do this.

793
00:58:18.065 --> 00:58:20.401
I don't give a
shit who it is, okay?

794
00:58:20.434 --> 00:58:22.303
I just wanna get the
hell out of here.

795
00:58:24.704 --> 00:58:25.704
Merritt.

796
00:59:38.111 --> 00:59:40.013
Please, please, please.

797
00:59:45.118 --> 00:59:46.118
Shit.

798
01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.834
What the hell?

799
01:00:37.504 --> 01:00:38.637
Fiddle music.

800
01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:39.538
What?

801
01:00:39.571 --> 01:00:40.507
I've had enough of this shit!

802
01:00:40.539 --> 01:00:42.007
- Hey, Brody!
- Stop!

803
01:00:42.041 --> 01:00:43.709
Brody!

804
01:00:43.742 --> 01:00:47.046
Stop playing your psycho-ass
music and come out and fight!

805
01:00:47.079 --> 01:00:48.547
Nadia, shut up.

806
01:00:50.682 --> 01:00:51.817
Oh my God.

807
01:00:53.285 --> 01:00:54.820
Holy shit.

808
01:01:02.594 --> 01:01:03.862
Run!

809
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.902
- Are you all right?
- No, my ankle!

810
01:01:11.904 --> 01:01:13.138
Shit!

811
01:01:17.076 --> 01:01:18.511
Nadia.

812
01:01:19.878 --> 01:01:21.080
Nadia, what are you doing?

813
01:01:26.251 --> 01:01:27.719
Nadia!

814
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:32.891
- You killed him!
- Nadia!

815
01:01:32.925 --> 01:01:34.827
- You killed him!
- Nadia, no!

816
01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:42.601
No, no, no, no!

817
01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:56.248
He's coming!

818
01:01:57.683 --> 01:01:58.993
Ellis, we have to check
the rest of the doors.

819
01:01:59.017 --> 01:02:01.620
- Ellis, come on!
- I can't get up!

820
01:02:01.653 --> 01:02:03.556
Don't leave me!

821
01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:04.823
Wait, you guys!

822
01:02:18.837 --> 01:02:20.706
No, no, no, no, no.

823
01:02:20.739 --> 01:02:21.739
Please, no.

824
01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:24.910
Get up.

825
01:02:24.943 --> 01:02:26.044
It hurts.

826
01:02:26.078 --> 01:02:27.279
Do it!

827
01:02:36.087 --> 01:02:38.256
Ellis, come on,
help me out here.

828
01:02:48.132 --> 01:02:49.501
The other one.

829
01:02:51.002 --> 01:02:52.003
Don't go.

830
01:02:52.036 --> 01:02:53.405
Wait, come back.

831
01:02:55.039 --> 01:02:56.107
Please.

832
01:03:08.052 --> 01:03:09.220
Okay.

833
01:03:11.122 --> 01:03:12.122
We're safe.

834
01:03:54.466 --> 01:03:55.667
Does it hurt?

835
01:03:57.768 --> 01:03:58.768
It's fine.

836
01:04:06.244 --> 01:04:11.249
So, I think about that
camping trip all the time.

837
01:04:17.288 --> 01:04:19.156
It's like I can see us there,

838
01:04:21.292 --> 01:04:26.097
and we're with my mom,

839
01:04:31.035 --> 01:04:36.006
and I'm looking up at all
of those really tall trees.

840
01:04:40.043 --> 01:04:41.445
I wish we could go back there.

841
01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.115
- Merritt-
- Stop.

842
01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:50.186
- Please, don't shut me-
- Just stop.

843
01:05:36.667 --> 01:05:37.667
Go away.

844
01:05:48.178 --> 01:05:50.080
Look up, Jane, look up.

845
01:05:59.457 --> 01:06:00.457
See her?

846
01:06:02.192 --> 01:06:07.163
That girl there, I've seen
what she's really about.

847
01:06:09.433 --> 01:06:10.768
I think you should see it, too.

848
01:06:13.036 --> 01:06:14.070
I should've just...

849
01:06:17.107 --> 01:06:18.108
I don't know.

850
01:06:22.413 --> 01:06:24.047
It's not your fault, Jane.

851
01:06:28.284 --> 01:06:29.387
It's not.

852
01:06:41.196 --> 01:06:44.933
Ellis!

853
01:06:44.967 --> 01:06:46.403
Jane.

854
01:06:58.481 --> 01:06:59.982
Oh my God.

855
01:07:11.226 --> 01:07:12.227
Where's Ellis?

856
01:07:16.666 --> 01:07:18.033
Come on.

857
01:07:18.066 --> 01:07:19.268
Where's Ellis?

858
01:07:19.301 --> 01:07:20.302
We have to go!

859
01:07:22.104 --> 01:07:23.038
It's him!

860
01:07:23.071 --> 01:07:24.071
Let's go!

861
01:07:24.808 --> 01:07:26.375
Where are we going?

862
01:07:26.409 --> 01:07:27.577
We have to go faster.

863
01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:28.610
Ow!

864
01:07:29.344 --> 01:07:30.379
Oh my God!

865
01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:33.282
Just a little further.

866
01:07:33.315 --> 01:07:35.050
- I can't, Jane!
- Yes, you can!

867
01:07:46.696 --> 01:07:47.464
We have to go.

868
01:07:47.497 --> 01:07:48.777
- Are you crazy?
- We have to go.

869
01:08:17.627 --> 01:08:22.264
Okay, okay.

870
01:08:26.703 --> 01:08:30.707
Jane.

871
01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:49.391
So, what, we just
wait until he pops

872
01:08:49.424 --> 01:08:51.359
out again and pulverizes us?

873
01:08:53.327 --> 01:08:54.327
Hello?

874
01:08:56.498 --> 01:09:00.502
Ow!

875
01:09:15.684 --> 01:09:18.352
Jane, where's Ellis?

876
01:09:20.556 --> 01:09:21.723
Tell me.

877
01:09:31.299 --> 01:09:33.200
This is all because of you.

878
01:09:40.308 --> 01:09:42.044
- Because of me?
- Oh, shut up.

879
01:09:43.445 --> 01:09:44.445
You know what you did,

880
01:09:45.581 --> 01:09:48.050
acting all helpless
with Aunspach.

881
01:09:48.082 --> 01:09:50.117
"Oh, Merritt, I don't
know what to do.

882
01:09:50.151 --> 01:09:51.553
"Merritt, help me, Merritt."

883
01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:53.354
"Oh, Merritt, oh, I'm so weak."

884
01:09:53.388 --> 01:09:54.856
He touched me.

885
01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:59.494
Oh, you loved it, right
until he got too close.

886
01:10:00.729 --> 01:10:03.599
So I saved the day,
even though you made

887
01:10:03.632 --> 01:10:07.168
me look like the asshole
when I told you not to.

888
01:10:08.503 --> 01:10:10.405
I told you not to tell anyone.

889
01:10:10.439 --> 01:10:13.575
Even though you stole
the only guy I ever liked.

890
01:10:13.609 --> 01:10:14.476
I didn't!

891
01:10:14.509 --> 01:10:16.945
Even though I'm the one, me,

892
01:10:16.979 --> 01:10:20.247
who got Aunspach's
dick out of your face.

893
01:10:20.281 --> 01:10:22.350
Because you
want to go to Princeton,

894
01:10:22.384 --> 01:10:23.619
you wanted that trust fund.

895
01:10:23.652 --> 01:10:25.754
Because I was your new mom!

896
01:10:29.323 --> 01:10:32.360
I got you friends
and play dates.

897
01:10:33.929 --> 01:10:37.432
I protected you, I
stood up for you.

898
01:10:37.466 --> 01:10:39.801
I cleaned your clothes,

899
01:10:39.835 --> 01:10:43.938
while you got to be the
little wonder-ass genius.

900
01:10:48.274 --> 01:10:50.678
"Why can't you be more
like Jane, Merritt?

901
01:10:52.079 --> 01:10:54.749
"She doesn't look like
cousin fucking Greg.

902
01:10:54.782 --> 01:10:57.250
"She doesn't gain
fucking water weight.

903
01:10:57.283 --> 01:10:58.452
"She could get into Princeton

904
01:10:58.486 --> 01:11:01.722
"with her sparkling
fucking eyes closed.

905
01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:04.825
"Why can't you be
smart and polite

906
01:11:04.859 --> 01:11:07.595
"and perfect and tiny
and virginal like her?"

907
01:11:07.628 --> 01:11:08.829
"What's wrong with you?"

908
01:11:11.766 --> 01:11:12.766
Well, guess what?

909
01:11:14.468 --> 01:11:15.468
I'm the cool one.

910
01:11:16.537 --> 01:11:19.106
I'm pretty and rich.

911
01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:22.576
Everyone wants to be my
friend and hook up with me,

912
01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:26.147
and you're not
better than me, okay?

913
01:11:26.179 --> 01:11:28.649
Nothing about you
is better than me.

914
01:11:29.817 --> 01:11:31.686
- Not your clothes.
- Stop, please.

915
01:11:31.719 --> 01:11:34.422
Or your voice or your hair.

916
01:11:34.455 --> 01:11:36.924
- Stop it!
- Or your body or your face.

917
01:11:36.957 --> 01:11:41.227
You're just sad,
small, and pathetic.

918
01:11:43.397 --> 01:11:44.598
- Shut up!
- Ow!

919
01:11:44.632 --> 01:11:46.167
- You little-
- You just shut up!

920
01:11:46.199 --> 01:11:46.967
Jane!

921
01:11:47.001 --> 01:11:48.001
Shut up!

922
01:13:27.634 --> 01:13:31.037
Jane, good to see you.

923
01:13:34.841 --> 01:13:36.042
Snickerdoodle?

924
01:13:37.811 --> 01:13:39.846
Miss Taylor baked these.

925
01:13:42.182 --> 01:13:43.182
They're very good.

926
01:13:50.623 --> 01:13:51.623
What do you want?

927
01:13:54.494 --> 01:13:59.499
You know, I thought that
our last talk was enough,

928
01:14:01.868 --> 01:14:04.771
but you needed something more,
so that's what I gave you.

929
01:14:06.371 --> 01:14:08.675
I didn't need anything from you.

930
01:14:16.816 --> 01:14:19.452
How did you feel when
you pushed Miss Sinclair?

931
01:14:21.654 --> 01:14:23.857
Do you think you could've
done that before?

932
01:14:26.826 --> 01:14:28.127
They held you back, Jane.

933
01:14:30.362 --> 01:14:32.732
They lowered you to their level.

934
01:14:32.765 --> 01:14:35.869
Anyone could see that,
except for yourself.

935
01:14:35.902 --> 01:14:39.339
But, tonight, that all changed.

936
01:14:41.007 --> 01:14:44.376
You outlasted every single
one of those fiddlers,

937
01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:47.747
and, now, you are free of them.

938
01:14:49.148 --> 01:14:51.216
You picked up the hammer.

939
01:14:54.019 --> 01:14:57.055
And you will accomplish every
exceptional piece of work

940
01:14:57.089 --> 01:14:58.624
that I know you're capable of,

941
01:14:58.657 --> 01:15:00.726
that I know you were born to do,

942
01:15:01.727 --> 01:15:06.665
because, my dearest
Jane, you are special.

943
01:15:15.707 --> 01:15:19.278
Oh, I forgot.

944
01:15:21.113 --> 01:15:22.114
I hope it's in here.

945
01:15:23.849 --> 01:15:28.854
Oh, motherfucker.

946
01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:31.390
Oh.

947
01:15:35.093 --> 01:15:36.795
You dropped this the other day,

948
01:15:38.430 --> 01:15:40.799
so I held onto it for you.

949
01:15:49.141 --> 01:15:54.146
I'll give it back
if you thank me.

950
01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:57.316
How about it?

951
01:15:58.817 --> 01:16:01.421
Thank a man for caring
as much as I have,

952
01:16:02.621 --> 01:16:05.090
for teaching you how
to become a woman.

953
01:16:32.784 --> 01:16:34.152
You know what?

954
01:16:37.022 --> 01:16:38.690
I have learned something.

955
01:16:42.327 --> 01:16:43.628
I'm not pathetic!

956
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:12.890
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

957
01:17:56.867 --> 01:17:58.702
Yes!

958
01:18:25.963 --> 01:18:27.532
No!

959
01:18:27.566 --> 01:18:29.468
You just won't learn, will you?

960
01:20:28.985 --> 01:20:29.985
Jane.

961
01:21:52.034 --> 01:21:53.035
Oh, shit.

962
01:21:58.340 --> 01:21:59.340
What the?
