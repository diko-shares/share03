2
00:03:26.174 --> 00:03:27.474
Hey, Merritt.

3
00:03:27.508 --> 00:03:28.976
Cathy's getting
another facelift.

4
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.712
I said she'll look
like a wax monster.

5
00:03:30.745 --> 00:03:34.148
She said my acne's worse
than my cousin Greg.

6
00:03:34.182 --> 00:03:36.283
That's
not true, your face looks

7
00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:37.417
- pretty fine to me.
- What's this?

8
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:38.485
Oh.

9
00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.353
You were
out in the woods again.

10
00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:41.923
Yeah, only for a
few minutes, though.

11
00:03:41.956 --> 00:03:44.257
Pull your hair back
and find a mirror.

12
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:45.526
You look prehistoric.

13
00:03:47.528 --> 00:03:50.064
Ooh, something died
on your backpack.

14
00:03:50.098 --> 00:03:50.865
Ew, really?

15
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.569
Janey, you can't
stay like this.

16
00:04:01.576 --> 00:04:03.044
Tribal, dig it.

17
00:04:07.548 --> 00:04:08.583
Great.

18
00:04:23.965 --> 00:04:24.999
Excuse me.

19
00:04:27.602 --> 00:04:28.636
Excuse me.

20
00:04:30.571 --> 00:04:31.773
When's the retake?

21
00:04:32.874 --> 00:04:34.075
Yes.

22
00:04:34.108 --> 00:04:35.676
Mr. Aunspach,
you never taught us

23
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.944
anything on the test.

24
00:04:36.978 --> 00:04:38.780
The test
was from the reading,

25
00:04:38.813 --> 00:04:40.380
like the last one.

26
00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:41.783
Okay, but no one
knew what they were doing,

27
00:04:41.816 --> 00:04:44.585
like the last one, so.

28
00:04:46.521 --> 00:04:47.588
What's your flavor?

29
00:04:48.556 --> 00:04:49.524
What?

30
00:04:50.558 --> 00:04:51.491
Grape, right?

31
00:04:53.227 --> 00:04:56.764
Mr. Aunspach, we
deserve a retake.

32
00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:00.535
Now.

33
00:05:10.845 --> 00:05:13.648
As you can see, this
problem is a lot

34
00:05:13.681 --> 00:05:16.250
like the last one from the test.

35
00:05:16.284 --> 00:05:18.152
Anyone wanna give it a try?

36
00:05:18.186 --> 00:05:19.620
Come on.

37
00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:23.456
Are you for real?

38
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.358
- You want?
- I'm good.

39
00:05:25.392 --> 00:05:26.294
I think he does.

40
00:05:27.662 --> 00:05:28.763
Miss Shipley.

41
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:36.671
Jane.

42
00:05:39.607 --> 00:05:40.741
Will you come up?

43
00:07:03.557 --> 00:07:05.026
Whoa.

44
00:07:05.893 --> 00:07:06.661
Fuck me.

45
00:07:09.563 --> 00:07:12.733
Looks like we won't be
needing that retake, after all.

46
00:07:12.767 --> 00:07:14.467
What, are you serious?

47
00:07:14.502 --> 00:07:17.305
- No, that's not fair.
- Enough.

48
00:07:17.338 --> 00:07:18.572
She's
the only one that got it.

49
00:07:18.606 --> 00:07:20.741
No one else got it,
that's not fair.

50
00:07:20.775 --> 00:07:22.143
I said enough!

51
00:07:27.248 --> 00:07:30.751
One day, on the
prairie, a family

52
00:07:30.785 --> 00:07:32.787
was finishing the
last of their cabin,

53
00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.422
which they had been building

54
00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:36.624
the entire year, from scratch.

55
00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:40.928
While they were working
in the autumn chill,

56
00:07:40.962 --> 00:07:43.431
a woman, with holes in her coat

57
00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:45.866
and a fiddle under her
arm, walked up to them.

58
00:07:47.068 --> 00:07:50.972
"Please," she said,
"I'm hungry and cold.

59
00:07:51.005 --> 00:07:53.274
"Let me share a meal
and stay the night."

60
00:07:54.575 --> 00:07:56.043
The family was shocked.

61
00:07:57.812 --> 00:07:58.746
"How have you made it this far

62
00:07:58.779 --> 00:07:59.847
"with just the coat on your back

63
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.148
"and a fiddle under your arm?

64
00:08:01.182 --> 00:08:02.917
"Have you no food, no shelter?

65
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:04.952
"What were you doing
this whole summer?"

66
00:08:06.821 --> 00:08:09.890
"Playing music,"
the fiddler said.

67
00:08:11.325 --> 00:08:13.294
"Before I knew it,
the chill had come.

68
00:08:13.327 --> 00:08:14.762
"Please, give me some bread.

69
00:08:14.795 --> 00:08:16.496
"I deserve some food."

70
00:08:17.531 --> 00:08:18.866
The family had no choice.

71
00:08:20.835 --> 00:08:24.472
They turned their backs and
went on with their work.

72
00:08:26.807 --> 00:08:30.378
The fiddler did not live
to play another summer.

73
00:08:32.213 --> 00:08:33.047
The end.

74
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.156
Now, I think the family
had it all wrong, you see.

75
00:08:42.189 --> 00:08:45.726
I think they should have
taken that fiddle, right,

76
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.062
and then cracked it
over the woman's head,

77
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:50.931
and used the wood for kindling.

78
00:08:53.834 --> 00:08:55.436
Don't tell me what you deserve.

79
00:08:57.104 --> 00:08:57.938
Page 85.

80
00:10:15.449 --> 00:10:17.284
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.

81
00:10:17.318 --> 00:10:19.720
Oh, it's cool.

82
00:10:19.753 --> 00:10:20.921
You all right?

83
00:10:20.955 --> 00:10:22.524
Yeah.

84
00:10:22.557 --> 00:10:24.425
Just wanted to commend you
on your work at the board.

85
00:10:24.458 --> 00:10:26.994
I put you on the spot, but
I knew you could handle it.

86
00:10:29.029 --> 00:10:30.064
Thanks.

87
00:10:32.066 --> 00:10:34.268
You
never have to feel

88
00:10:34.301 --> 00:10:36.337
ashamed of your talents, Jane.

89
00:10:48.282 --> 00:10:49.984
You
like him, don't you?

90
00:10:52.587 --> 00:10:53.354
Who?

91
00:10:55.156 --> 00:10:56.157
You know!

92
00:10:59.693 --> 00:11:00.494
Ellis?

93
00:11:02.396 --> 00:11:03.197
No.

94
00:11:04.798 --> 00:11:07.668
I mean, he does have that
bad Daddy thing going on.

95
00:11:10.639 --> 00:11:13.207
Wait, Aunspach?

96
00:11:15.276 --> 00:11:19.880
Why else would you show
off like that in class, hmm?

97
00:11:20.814 --> 00:11:22.816
Merritt, no, I was...

98
00:11:24.952 --> 00:11:27.721
He was like pressuring me-

99
00:11:27.755 --> 00:11:29.624
- Oh, shut up, you loved it.

100
00:11:31.825 --> 00:11:35.630
I mean, okay, yeah,
it's math, it's whatever.

101
00:11:37.097 --> 00:11:40.968
I really didn't do the
reading or anything, I swear.

102
00:11:41.001 --> 00:11:41.902
I didn't wanna go up there,

103
00:11:41.936 --> 00:11:43.037
but it was like I
couldn't say no.

104
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.540
So tell him to stop.

105
00:11:45.574 --> 00:11:46.874
Go after school today.

106
00:11:49.043 --> 00:11:50.077
You think I should?

107
00:11:51.513 --> 00:11:55.115
Janey, the man's got a
hard-on for your derivatives.

108
00:11:55.149 --> 00:11:59.853
You could get him to do anything,
even get us that retake.

109
00:12:04.693 --> 00:12:07.027
Is Cathy really gonna
go that ballistic on you?

110
00:12:09.063 --> 00:12:11.600
Your mom was not
like mine, remember?

111
00:12:15.035 --> 00:12:17.505
Cathy said if I don't
get into Princeton,

112
00:12:17.539 --> 00:12:21.442
like every other Sinclair
since the birth of Christ,

113
00:12:21.475 --> 00:12:23.612
I won't see a dime
from my trust fund.

114
00:12:24.979 --> 00:12:25.980
What?

115
00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:29.250
Half the admissions
board drools

116
00:12:29.283 --> 00:12:31.352
over her tits at the club,

117
00:12:31.385 --> 00:12:32.753
but I doubt even they'll ignore

118
00:12:32.786 --> 00:12:34.755
the grades Aunspach's
shitting out.

119
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:39.059
"Aren't these turds just the
pride of the family, Merritt?"

120
00:12:40.729 --> 00:12:42.062
She said that to you?

121
00:12:43.297 --> 00:12:45.399
So, you'll talk to him.

122
00:12:53.107 --> 00:12:53.907
Yeah, yeah.

123
00:12:59.013 --> 00:13:00.114
Love you, Janey.

124
00:13:02.049 --> 00:13:03.117
I love you, too.

125
00:13:08.289 --> 00:13:09.390
One more thing.

126
00:13:09.423 --> 00:13:10.924
Yep?

127
00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.093
Never make me look
like an asshole again.

128
00:13:20.334 --> 00:13:21.168
Next.

129
00:13:22.637 --> 00:13:24.739
Pops, I'm doomed if
Brody gets more than four.

130
00:13:24.773 --> 00:13:26.775
No way these bis and
tris pump out five.

131
00:13:29.209 --> 00:13:30.477
- That's one.
- Just be yourself, son.

132
00:13:30.512 --> 00:13:31.378
That's two.

133
00:13:31.412 --> 00:13:32.446
But, Dad, if he's
more jacked than me-

134
00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:33.548
- That's three.

135
00:13:33.581 --> 00:13:35.215
Rakowski's gonna give him
the mascot gig for sure.

136
00:13:35.249 --> 00:13:36.283
Four.

137
00:13:36.317 --> 00:13:38.285
Stop him, Dad.

138
00:13:38.319 --> 00:13:39.119
Five.

139
00:13:44.759 --> 00:13:46.827
Boom, Brody's so lit!

140
00:13:47.796 --> 00:13:49.229
- All right, all right.
- Shut up.

141
00:13:51.198 --> 00:13:52.299
Miller.

142
00:13:53.934 --> 00:13:56.337
Does anyone actually know
what's in Rakowski's mug?

143
00:13:57.871 --> 00:13:58.673
Whisky.

144
00:14:01.308 --> 00:14:03.043
French.

145
00:14:03.077 --> 00:14:04.945
Don't fail me
now, testosterone.

146
00:14:06.715 --> 00:14:08.215
Go wreck 'em, Frenchy boy.

147
00:14:13.987 --> 00:14:15.989
Whisky, really?

148
00:14:16.023 --> 00:14:19.293
Brody said he saw eight
bottles in her desk drawer.

149
00:14:19.326 --> 00:14:21.995
Then he invited me
to his hot tub again.

150
00:14:22.029 --> 00:14:23.263
Eight bottles?

151
00:14:23.297 --> 00:14:25.999
We gotta raid,
like this weekend.

152
00:14:26.033 --> 00:14:28.268
Yeah, can't.

153
00:14:28.302 --> 00:14:31.038
I can
do it, I can do it.

154
00:14:31.071 --> 00:14:32.206
I can do it!

155
00:14:32.239 --> 00:14:33.474
Why can't you?

156
00:14:33.508 --> 00:14:36.210
Because once Cathy
sees my calculus test,

157
00:14:36.243 --> 00:14:39.279
she's gonna nail my labia
to the dining room floor.

158
00:14:39.313 --> 00:14:40.715
I can do it!

159
00:14:40.749 --> 00:14:43.450
No, I can't.

160
00:14:43.484 --> 00:14:46.721
Hey, when I was your age,
I could do 15 of those,

161
00:14:46.755 --> 00:14:48.790
and I had carpal
tunnel in both wrists.

162
00:14:48.823 --> 00:14:49.591
Get up.

163
00:14:51.225 --> 00:14:52.794
I can't, I can't.

164
00:14:56.029 --> 00:14:57.231
Boo!

165
00:15:01.736 --> 00:15:03.170
Jane, you almost
got a pull-up.

166
00:15:03.203 --> 00:15:05.005
What's your secret sauce?

167
00:15:05.038 --> 00:15:07.040
God, the wifi
here is such shit.

168
00:15:07.074 --> 00:15:10.210
Well, it's all about leverage,
as well as strength, right?

169
00:15:11.546 --> 00:15:13.347
It's not about bis and tris?

170
00:15:15.149 --> 00:15:19.186
Okay, so your latissimus
dorsi, your lats,

171
00:15:19.219 --> 00:15:20.220
they're actually-

172
00:15:20.254 --> 00:15:21.856
- Have you blown Aunspach?

173
00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:24.091
What?

174
00:15:27.361 --> 00:15:28.495
She hasn't blown him.

175
00:15:29.963 --> 00:15:30.899
Maybe you should.

176
00:15:32.099 --> 00:15:33.133
Take the edge off
him and make him

177
00:15:33.167 --> 00:15:35.870
less of a walking human penis.

178
00:15:38.305 --> 00:15:39.306
What?

179
00:15:42.276 --> 00:15:43.277
Geez, dude.

180
00:15:44.945 --> 00:15:46.413
Kinda cuts like chicken.

181
00:15:46.447 --> 00:15:48.282
Ew!

182
00:15:48.315 --> 00:15:49.283
Nice!

183
00:15:49.316 --> 00:15:51.351
Oh my god!

184
00:15:51.385 --> 00:15:53.987
Since when do you
care about your grades?

185
00:15:54.021 --> 00:15:56.925
Since I need a 3.0
to stay on the team.

186
00:15:56.957 --> 00:15:59.460
Oh, the team, the team.

187
00:15:59.493 --> 00:16:02.062
Don't act like you
don't care, pinko.

188
00:16:02.095 --> 00:16:03.832
Douche-box's work is
beyond college level,

189
00:16:03.865 --> 00:16:06.300
but now we have to do
it because she can.

190
00:16:07.502 --> 00:16:09.804
Erik's right, this is bullshit.

191
00:16:09.838 --> 00:16:13.073
Shipley, I swear to
God, if I can't play

192
00:16:13.106 --> 00:16:15.275
next Friday because of math,

193
00:16:15.309 --> 00:16:18.045
I will microwave
your TV dinner ass.

194
00:16:20.247 --> 00:16:21.583
Ew!

195
00:16:26.621 --> 00:16:30.224
I really didn't study
or do the reading.

196
00:16:32.326 --> 00:16:33.327
I swear.

197
00:16:34.361 --> 00:16:36.196
It's fine, no one
should give a shit,

198
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.398
so can we stop
talking about school,

199
00:16:38.432 --> 00:16:41.803
and put our considerable
free-thinking brains to good use?

200
00:16:41.836 --> 00:16:44.171
Like raiding Rakowski's
whisky stash.

201
00:16:44.204 --> 00:16:45.807
Rakowski's got a whisky stash?

202
00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.407
Son, Father will provide.

203
00:16:49.176 --> 00:16:50.845
Thanks, Pops.

204
00:16:50.879 --> 00:16:53.413
So raid on Friday night
before Brody gets here first?

205
00:16:53.447 --> 00:16:54.281
Yeah, I'm down.

206
00:16:55.482 --> 00:16:57.519
Well, what about
the new cameras?

207
00:16:58.485 --> 00:17:00.020
What new cameras?

208
00:17:04.224 --> 00:17:05.092
Those fascists.

209
00:17:06.326 --> 00:17:07.695
It doesn't matter,
we'll get around them.

210
00:17:07.729 --> 00:17:09.329
Friday night it is.

211
00:17:09.363 --> 00:17:10.532
Ellis, do you recall

212
00:17:10.565 --> 00:17:12.499
what Cathy said
about my genitals?

213
00:17:12.534 --> 00:17:14.234
Okay, so sneak out.

214
00:17:14.268 --> 00:17:15.870
The athletic wing will be open.

215
00:17:16.771 --> 00:17:18.071
It's Nadia's home game.

216
00:17:18.105 --> 00:17:19.541
If I play.

217
00:17:19.574 --> 00:17:21.776
Hey, Hoover, why'd you
fuck me at practice

218
00:17:21.809 --> 00:17:23.477
- the other day?
- Where is she going?

219
00:17:23.511 --> 00:17:25.178
Oh, this
is gonna be good.

220
00:17:25.212 --> 00:17:26.714
I can't even.

221
00:17:26.748 --> 00:17:28.883
How are we gonna get
around the security cameras

222
00:17:28.917 --> 00:17:30.450
on every single corner?

223
00:17:30.484 --> 00:17:31.953
Wow, that was violent.

224
00:17:33.253 --> 00:17:34.254
You can hack them.

225
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:37.157
You can?

226
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:38.425
Is no one else seeing this?

227
00:17:38.458 --> 00:17:42.129
Well, I only know
the theory, but, yeah.

228
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:44.566
Damn.

229
00:17:44.599 --> 00:17:46.968
Coach should probably
be seeing this.

230
00:17:47.001 --> 00:17:49.069
Cool, awesome, we'll do it.

231
00:17:50.437 --> 00:17:51.506
She might kill her, guys.

232
00:17:51.539 --> 00:17:54.107
Nadi, for shit's
sake, put her down.

233
00:17:54.943 --> 00:17:55.877
Raid!

234
00:17:56.711 --> 00:17:57.512
Nadi.

235
00:17:58.312 --> 00:17:59.547
Nadi, just get off her.

236
00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:17.397
Attention, students,

237
00:18:17.431 --> 00:18:19.199
as a reminder, flight
school and drama club

238
00:18:19.232 --> 00:18:21.703
are canceled this afternoon
for the installation

239
00:18:21.736 --> 00:18:24.505
of polycore security windows.

240
00:18:24.539 --> 00:18:27.508
Also, please, be aware
that the new security gate

241
00:18:27.542 --> 00:18:29.677
will be activated in 20 minutes.

242
00:18:43.658 --> 00:18:44.458
Hello?

243
00:19:18.526 --> 00:19:19.527
Hi.

244
00:19:21.194 --> 00:19:22.630
- Hi.
- Jane, good to see ya.

245
00:19:29.804 --> 00:19:32.907
So I wanted to ask
you about that retake.

246
00:19:44.451 --> 00:19:45.820
Look, Mr. Aunspach.

247
00:19:50.692 --> 00:19:53.628
Mr. Aunspach, did you hear me?

248
00:19:53.661 --> 00:19:56.396
You ever feel like you're
living in the wrong time?

249
00:19:57.532 --> 00:19:59.667
Like someone mixed up
when you were born?

250
00:20:01.536 --> 00:20:02.870
Um-

251
00:20:02.904 --> 00:20:06.206
- I always thought I should
be on the great frontier,

252
00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.777
back when the railroads
were being built,

253
00:20:09.811 --> 00:20:13.581
when there were new
towns, cities, sheriffs.

254
00:20:15.583 --> 00:20:20.588
No plastics, no
screens, no wifi.

255
00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:27.995
Like our mascot, Anvil Al,
working with his tools,

256
00:20:28.029 --> 00:20:30.363
forging things of
substance, potential.

257
00:20:32.934 --> 00:20:35.536
I mean, I always thought
he looked kind of silly,

258
00:20:37.205 --> 00:20:40.541
you know, with all
that hair.

259
00:20:40.575 --> 00:20:41.408
Number nine.

260
00:20:43.778 --> 00:20:45.412
You got it wrong on your test.

261
00:20:46.614 --> 00:20:49.584
Oh, yeah, I must've-

262
00:20:49.617 --> 00:20:53.554
- It's odd to me because,
given your understanding

263
00:20:53.588 --> 00:20:56.256
of the concepts, I don't
see why that 96 wasn't 100.

264
00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:02.096
Well, there's been a lot
to study for the semester.

265
00:21:03.531 --> 00:21:04.599
How long did you study?

266
00:21:07.568 --> 00:21:08.736
Hours?

267
00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:10.303
- I'm not sure.
- Not at all?

268
00:21:10.337 --> 00:21:12.339
No, no, I did study, and-

269
00:21:12.372 --> 00:21:13.808
- Don't lie.

270
00:21:13.841 --> 00:21:15.810
I see how you are in my class.

271
00:21:15.843 --> 00:21:18.613
You don't listen,
you don't take notes.

272
00:21:19.647 --> 00:21:21.249
It's because of them, isn't it?

273
00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:22.950
Because of what they'll think.

274
00:21:24.152 --> 00:21:27.755
I thought I told you,
don't feel ashamed.

275
00:21:27.789 --> 00:21:30.958
No, no, I'm not ashamed,

276
00:21:30.992 --> 00:21:34.629
and I do listen, I
do take notes, I do.

277
00:21:36.429 --> 00:21:37.430
Hey, wait.

278
00:21:39.834 --> 00:21:40.635
Can you stop?

279
00:21:51.279 --> 00:21:55.249
Okay, so I'm
already doing better

280
00:21:55.283 --> 00:21:56.617
than everybody else here.

281
00:21:56.651 --> 00:21:59.253
Better than who,
a bunch of morons?

282
00:21:59.287 --> 00:22:02.590
There are two kinds
of people, Jane.

283
00:22:02.623 --> 00:22:04.826
Fiddle people, hammer people.

284
00:22:04.859 --> 00:22:07.327
Fiddle people, they can't
build, they can't make.

285
00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.462
They play, they drive
their convertibles,

286
00:22:09.496 --> 00:22:13.400
and then, after a while, summer
ends, and what happens then?

287
00:22:13.433 --> 00:22:15.570
They take from
the hammer people,

288
00:22:15.603 --> 00:22:17.238
the people that have been
working month after month,

289
00:22:17.271 --> 00:22:18.673
who don't trash their gifts.

290
00:22:18.706 --> 00:22:20.942
They use them to make things.

291
00:22:20.975 --> 00:22:23.010
Fiddle people, hammer people,

292
00:22:23.044 --> 00:22:26.647
and it's my job to make
you pick up the hammer.

293
00:22:27.882 --> 00:22:29.784
But all I see is you hanging
out with the fiddlers,

294
00:22:29.817 --> 00:22:32.987
trying to get them to like
you, and you know what?

295
00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:34.989
It's not cute, Jane.

296
00:22:35.022 --> 00:22:35.857
It's pathetic.

297
00:22:38.292 --> 00:22:40.493
This, this is a waste.

298
00:22:41.394 --> 00:22:43.865
They are a waste.

299
00:22:43.898 --> 00:22:47.568
That, that is a gift.

300
00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:50.705
Don't you dare throw it away.

301
00:23:09.824 --> 00:23:10.591
Okay.

302
00:23:23.871 --> 00:23:25.172
Fuck you!

303
00:24:05.613 --> 00:24:07.581
Hey, Merritt.

304
00:24:55.429 --> 00:24:57.331
Do you think he'll do something?

305
00:24:57.365 --> 00:24:58.165
Sure.

306
00:25:03.671 --> 00:25:04.972
Okay, but I really don't want

307
00:25:05.006 --> 00:25:06.173
to make it a big deal, Merritt.

308
00:25:06.207 --> 00:25:08.175
Really, really,
'cause I just wanna

309
00:25:08.209 --> 00:25:10.478
tell what happened,
and maybe he'll talk

310
00:25:10.511 --> 00:25:12.546
to him about it and that's
it, and then we can go, so.

311
00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:13.381
Jane.

312
00:25:14.215 --> 00:25:15.316
Chill your clit.

313
00:25:19.487 --> 00:25:20.554
Ladies.

314
00:25:30.798 --> 00:25:31.999
Mr. Lawson.

315
00:25:33.401 --> 00:25:34.802
So, you approached him-

316
00:25:35.836 --> 00:25:40.374
- Oh, no, no, no,
he approached me.

317
00:25:41.876 --> 00:25:45.546
And he grabbed my backpack,
he took out my notebook,

318
00:25:45.579 --> 00:25:47.214
and he get got really angry.

319
00:25:47.248 --> 00:25:49.216
So he was angry
you had a notebook?

320
00:25:51.585 --> 00:25:53.988
No, he was mad that the
notebook had drawings in it.

321
00:25:54.021 --> 00:25:56.891
So your calculus notebook
was full of drawings?

322
00:25:58.726 --> 00:26:00.728
That's not the point.

323
00:26:02.063 --> 00:26:06.434
He got really close to me,
and he got really angry.

324
00:26:06.467 --> 00:26:08.369
Angry you weren't
applying yourself.

325
00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:10.871
Yeah, makes sense to me.

326
00:26:10.905 --> 00:26:13.374
Sir, this isn't the first time

327
00:26:13.407 --> 00:26:16.911
I felt really
uncomfortable around him,

328
00:26:18.446 --> 00:26:19.880
but this time he did more.

329
00:26:19.914 --> 00:26:23.851
He reached out at me and
grabbed me and shook me-

330
00:26:23.884 --> 00:26:26.754
- Do you prefer to
always feel comfortable,

331
00:26:26.787 --> 00:26:29.924
never be told how to
improve, how to get better?

332
00:26:31.992 --> 00:26:33.394
That's not what I'm saying.

333
00:26:33.427 --> 00:26:35.930
That's what a good
teacher does, Miss Shipley.

334
00:26:37.064 --> 00:26:38.232
I understand, but this-

335
00:26:38.265 --> 00:26:39.800
- I don't like how
this is being handled.

336
00:26:44.105 --> 00:26:45.272
I'm sorry?

337
00:26:45.306 --> 00:26:46.874
And, more importantly,
I don't think

338
00:26:46.907 --> 00:26:48.476
my father would, either.

339
00:26:53.114 --> 00:26:54.281
Miss Sinclair-

340
00:26:54.315 --> 00:26:57.051
- Mr. Lawson, the
school board's opinion

341
00:26:57.084 --> 00:26:59.453
does matter to you, doesn't it?

342
00:26:59.487 --> 00:27:01.922
How much do your wife's
medical bills run a month?

343
00:27:07.161 --> 00:27:08.629
Let's try this again.

344
00:27:08.662 --> 00:27:11.098
And this time, you'll
let Jane finish,

345
00:27:11.132 --> 00:27:13.134
and, when she does, you'll think

346
00:27:13.167 --> 00:27:15.035
very hard about that opinion

347
00:27:15.069 --> 00:27:18.172
and exactly what you'll do
with your staff to preserve it.

348
00:27:29.783 --> 00:27:30.585
Go on.

349
00:27:38.792 --> 00:27:40.161
Mr. Aunspach.

350
00:27:43.097 --> 00:27:44.198
Mr. Aunspach.

351
00:27:57.878 --> 00:28:00.080
Wow, what
a nail-biter, folks.

352
00:28:00.114 --> 00:28:01.448
Let's go, Anvils!

353
00:28:01.482 --> 00:28:03.083
We're all tied up.

354
00:28:03.117 --> 00:28:05.587
With only minutes left in
penalty for either team

355
00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:07.721
to seal the deal.

356
00:28:07.755 --> 00:28:09.356
Today's game has
been brought to you

357
00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:12.993
by Paul's Polycore
Security Glass.

358
00:28:13.027 --> 00:28:15.396
Here comes Paul
himself for a test.

359
00:28:21.068 --> 00:28:23.037
Look, folks, not even
Anvil Al can break

360
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:25.372
the patented polycore pane.

361
00:28:25.406 --> 00:28:27.841
Yeah, that's right,
Brody can't even break it!

362
00:28:27.875 --> 00:28:28.776
Boo!

363
00:28:28.809 --> 00:28:30.811
Brody sucks, Brody sucks!

364
00:28:30.844 --> 00:28:33.180
Paul's
Polycore, protecting property,

365
00:28:33.214 --> 00:28:34.616
protecting people.

366
00:28:34.649 --> 00:28:35.983
Go, Nadia, woo!

367
00:28:37.184 --> 00:28:39.987
I hate you, Brody, I hate you!

368
00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.590
Hey, look
who's over there.

369
00:28:41.623 --> 00:28:44.425
Hey, Miss Rakowski, you
picked the wrong mascot.

370
00:28:44.458 --> 00:28:46.994
You made the biggest
mistake of your entire life!

371
00:28:47.027 --> 00:28:48.162
Sure told her, didn't I, Dad?

372
00:28:48.195 --> 00:28:49.664
I'm proud of you, son.

373
00:28:49.698 --> 00:28:51.131
And,
now, back to the field.

374
00:28:51.165 --> 00:28:52.066
Let's go!

375
00:28:53.367 --> 00:28:54.969
What if he does something?

376
00:28:55.002 --> 00:28:56.003
He won't.

377
00:28:57.037 --> 00:28:57.838
Why not?

378
00:28:58.939 --> 00:29:01.141
Stop freaking
your shit and think.

379
00:29:01.175 --> 00:29:03.010
Why do you think the
school kept it quiet?

380
00:29:03.043 --> 00:29:05.946
He leaves, no one talks,
neither side gets screwed.

381
00:29:07.114 --> 00:29:08.916
Parker
receives the pass.

382
00:29:10.084 --> 00:29:11.051
Now it's this whole thing.

383
00:29:11.085 --> 00:29:12.253
Parker's got the ball.

384
00:29:12.286 --> 00:29:13.387
You got it, Nadi!

385
00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:14.755
And I told you I didn't
want anyone to know.

386
00:29:14.788 --> 00:29:16.056
Oh, shut up!

387
00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:18.058
You won't ever see him again.

388
00:29:18.092 --> 00:29:19.093
Parker's still going.

389
00:29:19.126 --> 00:29:20.294
But that's not what I wanted.

390
00:29:20.327 --> 00:29:22.997
Jane, do you really
think men lay off

391
00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:24.298
because you ask them nicely?

392
00:29:27.067 --> 00:29:29.270
Anvils lose control.

393
00:29:30.471 --> 00:29:32.273
Grow a uterus.

394
00:29:32.306 --> 00:29:35.209
Come on, Nadi!

395
00:29:35.242 --> 00:29:37.311
Williams
gets the ball.

396
00:29:37.344 --> 00:29:38.245
Goddamn it!

397
00:29:40.114 --> 00:29:44.218
Williams
shoots and she scores!

398
00:29:44.251 --> 00:29:46.987
Point goes to the Eagles.

399
00:29:47.021 --> 00:29:48.088
And that's the game, folks.

400
00:29:48.122 --> 00:29:50.457
The Eagles take
it over the Anvils

401
00:29:50.491 --> 00:29:52.393
in a nail-biting
four to three finish.

402
00:29:54.094 --> 00:29:55.296
The Anvils would like
to thank everybody

403
00:29:55.329 --> 00:29:57.998
for coming out to
witness this final game

404
00:29:58.032 --> 00:30:00.200
between the Eagles
and the Anvils.

405
00:30:08.042 --> 00:30:09.678
And that Polycore Pane.

406
00:30:09.711 --> 00:30:12.212
Paul's Polycore Security Glass.

407
00:30:13.414 --> 00:30:14.982
And, while you're
there, don't forget

408
00:30:15.015 --> 00:30:18.620
to take a selfie with Paul's
Polycore Security Camera.

409
00:30:24.858 --> 00:30:26.695
- Why don't you fuck off,
- Brody?

410
00:30:26.728 --> 00:30:27.796
Oh, shit.

411
00:30:27.828 --> 00:30:29.129
- Hey!
- Yo, get off her,

412
00:30:29.163 --> 00:30:31.198
- you piece of shit!
- French, French!

413
00:30:37.539 --> 00:30:39.173
No, don't do this.

414
00:30:39.206 --> 00:30:41.643
It's not
covering enough.

415
00:30:41.676 --> 00:30:42.976
Ow!

416
00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:45.179
This is
more me than you.

417
00:30:47.214 --> 00:30:48.783
Dude, I'm
pretty sure he grew

418
00:30:48.817 --> 00:30:50.184
facial hair in fourth grade.

419
00:30:50.217 --> 00:30:51.952
No, I mean like
he's obviously on steroids.

420
00:30:51.985 --> 00:30:53.887
No one can just
do five pull-ups.

421
00:30:53.921 --> 00:30:56.290
He's been held back
like four times.

422
00:31:32.259 --> 00:31:34.061
- Just go.
- Shut up.

423
00:31:35.362 --> 00:31:37.064
Ah, Rakowski's lair.

424
00:31:38.265 --> 00:31:40.067
Smells like I always
dreamed it would.

425
00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:43.303
People hide their spares
in the most pathetic places.

426
00:31:43.337 --> 00:31:44.905
Found this in
about five seconds.

427
00:31:45.874 --> 00:31:47.074
Where's the goods?

428
00:31:47.107 --> 00:31:48.576
Brody said the
bottom right drawer.

429
00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:50.244
Do we
trust that maniac?

430
00:31:50.277 --> 00:31:52.212
He's obsessed
with me, it's fine.

431
00:31:53.447 --> 00:31:55.449
Security initiative, my ass.

432
00:31:56.383 --> 00:31:58.051
The janitor gave me the code.

433
00:31:58.085 --> 00:31:59.319
Traded it for a bag of weed.

434
00:33:12.326 --> 00:33:15.295
What in the name
of Paul Bunyan?

435
00:33:16.598 --> 00:33:20.300
Dad, remind me to never make
the Rakowskinator angry again.

436
00:33:20.334 --> 00:33:21.536
She has an ax.

437
00:33:22.537 --> 00:33:24.772
Teachers are messed up, son.

438
00:33:24.806 --> 00:33:25.974
Think about it.

439
00:33:26.006 --> 00:33:27.307
We see them all day,

440
00:33:27.341 --> 00:33:28.810
we're trapped inside
a school with them,

441
00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:31.211
with no idea where
they came from,

442
00:33:31.245 --> 00:33:33.213
what they were doing
before class, or after.

443
00:33:34.081 --> 00:33:35.482
Could be into all kinds of shit.

444
00:33:35.517 --> 00:33:37.585
Like sock puppets, dude.

445
00:33:37.619 --> 00:33:38.987
The kind of power
that they have

446
00:33:39.019 --> 00:33:42.356
and the things that they
can do and say to us

447
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:45.225
that'll mess with us for
the rest of our lives.

448
00:33:47.394 --> 00:33:51.131
It's just scary.

449
00:33:52.667 --> 00:33:54.334
I'm all for that
Miss Taylor, though.

450
00:33:54.368 --> 00:33:57.705
She can sub in for Aunspach's
class any day that she wants.

451
00:33:57.739 --> 00:33:59.908
That babushka is spicy.

452
00:33:59.941 --> 00:34:00.842
Anyone would've beaten

453
00:34:00.875 --> 00:34:02.409
the Aunspachian autocracy.

454
00:34:04.344 --> 00:34:06.313
Whoa, guys, guys!

455
00:34:06.346 --> 00:34:07.447
I found Rakowski's diary.

456
00:34:09.249 --> 00:34:11.418
- Shit, really?
- Yeah.

457
00:34:11.451 --> 00:34:12.219
What's it say?

458
00:34:12.252 --> 00:34:13.888
Whoa, whoa.

459
00:34:13.922 --> 00:34:15.389
She really does not like us.

460
00:34:17.124 --> 00:34:19.594
Oh, shit, our gym
teacher's messed up.

461
00:34:21.061 --> 00:34:22.262
What the fuck is this?

462
00:34:24.866 --> 00:34:26.199
Boo.

463
00:34:26.233 --> 00:34:27.267
Real mature.

464
00:34:27.301 --> 00:34:29.136
You screamed so loud.

465
00:34:29.169 --> 00:34:31.204
French, for you, buddy.

466
00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.273
Cool.

467
00:34:33.307 --> 00:34:35.175
Wait, shouldn't
Jane be back by now?

468
00:34:35.208 --> 00:34:36.544
Just open the drawer.

469
00:34:36.578 --> 00:34:37.612
Yes, master.

470
00:34:45.385 --> 00:34:46.386
Shit.

471
00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:50.725
I will wear his
intestines as a necklace.

472
00:36:30.625 --> 00:36:32.459
400,000.

473
00:36:32.492 --> 00:36:33.661
Okay.

474
00:36:33.695 --> 00:36:34.494
300,000.

475
00:36:35.797 --> 00:36:37.832
Okay.

476
00:36:37.865 --> 00:36:38.700
250?

477
00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:42.870
No?

478
00:36:43.805 --> 00:36:45.106
It's Mr. Gibbons, Nadia.

479
00:36:45.139 --> 00:36:47.608
Okay, for a quarter
of a million dollars,

480
00:36:47.642 --> 00:36:49.510
you wouldn't eat your cat?

481
00:36:51.512 --> 00:36:53.380
Actually, no, no, no, no!

482
00:36:54.549 --> 00:36:56.117
Dad, she's being mean.

483
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:58.218
Son, you're gonna eat your
cat and you're gonna like it.

484
00:37:05.193 --> 00:37:05.993
Whoa, sailor.

485
00:37:09.163 --> 00:37:10.732
I've got one.

486
00:37:10.765 --> 00:37:14.736
The lowest price to kill the
person you hate the most.

487
00:37:14.769 --> 00:37:16.704
Coach Ramirez, 10 grand.

488
00:37:16.738 --> 00:37:17.538
Brody!

489
00:37:21.542 --> 00:37:23.578
Frenchy,
how much have you had?

490
00:37:24.912 --> 00:37:26.681
One.

491
00:37:26.714 --> 00:37:27.447
One what?

492
00:37:27.481 --> 00:37:28.750
Just one.

493
00:37:28.783 --> 00:37:30.718
Okay, Nadi, don't worry about

494
00:37:30.752 --> 00:37:34.354
Coach Senora Ramirez or anybody.

495
00:37:34.387 --> 00:37:36.657
You played wonderfully tonight.

496
00:37:36.691 --> 00:37:39.259
Truly.

497
00:37:40.928 --> 00:37:43.798
Okay, Merritt,
who's your target?

498
00:37:46.934 --> 00:37:49.637
Cathy, 30 grand.

499
00:37:50.538 --> 00:37:51.304
20?

500
00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.175
Sure.

501
00:37:54.208 --> 00:37:55.510
I am sad.

502
00:37:55.543 --> 00:37:57.812
Your mom, that's
pretty messed up.

503
00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:00.782
You don't know her.

504
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:03.684
A sad little function.

505
00:38:07.054 --> 00:38:07.822
What about you?

506
00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:11.025
The president.

507
00:38:11.058 --> 00:38:13.628
The current president?

508
00:38:13.661 --> 00:38:16.296
Any president,
they're all tyrants.

509
00:38:16.329 --> 00:38:17.165
Fucking mascot.

510
00:38:18.733 --> 00:38:20.802
- Brody's the fucking mascot.
- Okay, um-

511
00:38:20.835 --> 00:38:23.403
- Sic temper tyrannis, Shipley.

512
00:38:24.572 --> 00:38:26.541
Look, the people
who think they know

513
00:38:26.574 --> 00:38:28.843
better than everybody else
about how they should live

514
00:38:28.876 --> 00:38:32.312
their lives, and then force
them to live it their way,

515
00:38:32.345 --> 00:38:34.582
no one should be
able to do that.

516
00:38:34.615 --> 00:38:37.919
Those people need to be
destroyed, whatever the cost.

517
00:38:37.952 --> 00:38:39.053
Even if it's blood.

518
00:38:40.755 --> 00:38:42.623
Blah, blah, blah,
the government.

519
00:38:42.657 --> 00:38:44.091
Blah, blah, blah, tyranny.

520
00:38:45.293 --> 00:38:46.961
That's all you ever talk about.

521
00:38:46.994 --> 00:38:48.596
It's so boring.

522
00:38:50.131 --> 00:38:51.666
Don't let him fool you.

523
00:38:51.699 --> 00:38:53.668
He's just pissed at his
parents like the rest of us.

524
00:38:53.701 --> 00:38:55.303
What song should I sing?

525
00:38:55.335 --> 00:38:56.237
What?

526
00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:57.972
You don't agree with me?

527
00:38:58.005 --> 00:38:58.973
I can't think.

528
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:07.315
I always think there's
always a peaceful solution.

529
00:39:09.717 --> 00:39:10.518
Always?

530
00:39:11.484 --> 00:39:13.154
You really believe that?

531
00:39:13.187 --> 00:39:13.988
Don't know.

532
00:39:14.021 --> 00:39:15.590
Yeah, I guess.

533
00:39:15.623 --> 00:39:17.658
- Bullshit.
- Oh, I had it.

534
00:39:19.293 --> 00:39:22.063
Even you would kill somebody
if they did enough to you.

535
00:39:27.501 --> 00:39:29.136
- No.
- Oh, please.

536
00:39:30.571 --> 00:39:32.472
I don't think I would.

537
00:39:32.506 --> 00:39:33.473
Why not?

538
00:39:37.044 --> 00:39:41.749
'Cause then I'd feel guilty,

539
00:39:41.782 --> 00:39:45.586
and I hate feeling that way.

540
00:39:46.921 --> 00:39:49.190
What has your shiny
ass possibly done

541
00:39:49.223 --> 00:39:50.858
to feel guilty about?

542
00:39:55.229 --> 00:39:56.030
I don't.

543
00:39:57.565 --> 00:40:00.635
Looks like little
Janey has a little secret.

544
00:40:00.668 --> 00:40:01.903
No.

545
00:40:01.936 --> 00:40:03.604
Come on,
you can tell us.

546
00:40:05.773 --> 00:40:06.641
She doesn't wanna
talk about it.

547
00:40:06.674 --> 00:40:07.742
Sure she does.

548
00:40:07.775 --> 00:40:09.710
- Stop.
- Spill, Shipley.

549
00:40:09.744 --> 00:40:10.745
Stop it.

550
00:40:10.778 --> 00:40:11.579
Spill.

551
00:40:13.948 --> 00:40:16.317
I have it, I have it.

552
00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:17.118
What?

553
00:40:19.353 --> 00:40:21.789
Lowest money to see
Miss Taylor's boobies.

554
00:40:23.524 --> 00:40:24.424
Zero dollars.

555
00:40:27.395 --> 00:40:28.162
Get up.

556
00:40:29.597 --> 00:40:30.731
What?

557
00:40:30.765 --> 00:40:31.766
That wasn't funny.

558
00:40:33.466 --> 00:40:34.268
No.

559
00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:37.437
Good one, Frenchy.

560
00:40:48.816 --> 00:40:50.384
Why didn't
you stop her?

561
00:40:52.119 --> 00:40:53.554
Why didn't you?

562
00:40:56.757 --> 00:40:58.025
Look, I already told you,

563
00:40:58.059 --> 00:41:00.127
I don't want anyone
to know what happened,

564
00:41:00.161 --> 00:41:01.461
and you already made a-

565
00:41:01.494 --> 00:41:02.763
- I already fixed
your problem for you

566
00:41:02.797 --> 00:41:03.831
because you couldn't
do that, either?

567
00:41:05.833 --> 00:41:06.634
What?

568
00:41:09.003 --> 00:41:10.938
You sound just like-

569
00:41:12.573 --> 00:41:13.641
- How do I sound like?

570
00:41:30.458 --> 00:41:32.960
If you could
kiss one animal, would you?

571
00:41:32.994 --> 00:41:34.395
A tiger.

572
00:41:58.953 --> 00:41:59.887
What?

573
00:42:01.288 --> 00:42:02.556
You know what.

574
00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:03.524
No, I don't.

575
00:42:06.027 --> 00:42:08.863
I have other
options, you know.

576
00:42:08.896 --> 00:42:10.164
Brody practically stalks me.

577
00:42:11.732 --> 00:42:13.968
I'm sure the two of you
will be very happy together.

578
00:42:14.001 --> 00:42:14.969
He's a great guy.

579
00:42:16.704 --> 00:42:17.506
Excuse me?

580
00:42:18.539 --> 00:42:20.307
Merritt, we hooked up twice.

581
00:42:20.341 --> 00:42:22.209
It didn't even matter.

582
00:42:35.089 --> 00:42:36.323
Aunspach assaulted Jane.

583
00:42:36.357 --> 00:42:37.358
What?

584
00:42:37.391 --> 00:42:39.528
On Monday after class.

585
00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.062
Then they fired him.

586
00:42:41.095 --> 00:42:43.998
That's why we've had
Miss Taylor all week.

587
00:42:44.031 --> 00:42:44.799
Jesus!

588
00:42:46.567 --> 00:42:48.069
That total piece of shit.

589
00:42:48.102 --> 00:42:52.473
Yeah, I mean, she
probably won't wanna get

590
00:42:52.507 --> 00:42:54.543
with anyone for a
while after that, so.

591
00:42:56.377 --> 00:42:57.411
Thought you should know.

592
00:43:00.981 --> 00:43:02.183
You're a terrible friend.

593
00:43:03.451 --> 00:43:04.519
You know that?

594
00:43:06.921 --> 00:43:07.721
Fuck you.

595
00:43:26.307 --> 00:43:28.275
Dude, I can't
believe that shit happened.

596
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:29.910
Yeah.

597
00:43:29.944 --> 00:43:32.113
He wasn't expecting me to
headbutt his fist like that.

598
00:43:33.447 --> 00:43:34.248
Does it hurt?

599
00:43:35.149 --> 00:43:36.750
This, oh, nah.

600
00:43:38.587 --> 00:43:40.921
You can touch it if you want.

601
00:43:40.955 --> 00:43:43.224
Okay, ow, don't, please,
don't touch it, actually.

602
00:43:44.725 --> 00:43:45.893
You're such an idiot.

603
00:43:57.271 --> 00:43:59.006
Miss Taylor's really
that hot, huh?

604
00:44:00.174 --> 00:44:02.109
Oh, yeah, she's
crazy super hot.

605
00:44:05.846 --> 00:44:06.647
Awesome.

606
00:44:08.816 --> 00:44:09.618
What?

607
00:44:13.787 --> 00:44:14.556
Nothing.

608
00:44:15.789 --> 00:44:16.690
Go hump her blue.

609
00:44:18.959 --> 00:44:22.997
Nadia, you always
hide your cheesy sadness

610
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:24.832
in a tortilla of rage.

611
00:44:24.865 --> 00:44:27.636
Now, tell me what's really
going on inside that burrito.

612
00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:35.610
You really don't know?

613
00:44:35.644 --> 00:44:37.311
Know what?

614
00:44:39.313 --> 00:44:41.815
I really have to tell you?

615
00:44:41.849 --> 00:44:43.518
Tell me what?

616
00:44:47.888 --> 00:44:51.692
Wait.

617
00:45:35.369 --> 00:45:36.203
Why Brody?

618
00:45:37.738 --> 00:45:38.607
Why not me?

619
00:45:40.174 --> 00:45:42.711
What's wrong with me?

620
00:45:50.251 --> 00:45:54.021
♪ I've been working
on the railroad ♪

621
00:45:54.054 --> 00:45:58.025

628
00:46:22.651 --> 00:46:24.251
How am I supposed
to do anything

629
00:46:24.285 --> 00:46:26.186
if I can't connect to anything?

630
00:46:30.291 --> 00:46:31.091
He'll be back.

631
00:46:33.595 --> 00:46:34.828
I'm gonna go check.

632
00:46:43.137 --> 00:46:44.606
Frenchy, are you okay?

633
00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:47.776
French?

634
00:46:54.549 --> 00:46:55.349
He's fine.

635
00:46:57.184 --> 00:46:58.319
One time, he drank a keg.

636
00:47:00.287 --> 00:47:01.989
Shit, I lost my anklet.

637
00:47:03.023 --> 00:47:04.892
I think I left it in the pool.

638
00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.629
Let's go look for it.

639
00:47:07.662 --> 00:47:09.731
Okay, well, if
Cathy doesn't find me

640
00:47:09.764 --> 00:47:11.566
sitting at home
knitting a tea cozy,

641
00:47:11.599 --> 00:47:14.168
she'll stab my face,
so the car leaves now.

642
00:47:14.201 --> 00:47:15.737
Just give us a second, okay?

643
00:47:17.037 --> 00:47:18.272
Fine, fine.

644
00:47:32.353 --> 00:47:33.521
French?

645
00:48:12.727 --> 00:48:13.528
Hey.

646
00:48:15.129 --> 00:48:19.266
So, Merritt told me what
happened with Aunspach.

647
00:48:30.879 --> 00:48:31.746
She told you?

648
00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:34.448
She shouldn't have, I know.

649
00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:47.327
Are you...

650
00:48:48.596 --> 00:48:49.430
Shit.

651
00:48:55.169 --> 00:49:00.207
Look, I'm really sorry
that happened to you.

652
00:49:13.287 --> 00:49:14.221
Hey, guys.

653
00:49:19.159 --> 00:49:20.762
Nadi?

654
00:49:24.298 --> 00:49:25.633
Nadia.

655
00:49:30.505 --> 00:49:35.242
Nadia, what's going on?

656
00:49:35.275 --> 00:49:36.477
What's wrong?

657
00:49:36.511 --> 00:49:37.444
Nadia!

658
00:49:41.048 --> 00:49:41.950
Was it French?

659
00:49:41.982 --> 00:49:43.250
Is he in there?

660
00:49:43.283 --> 00:49:45.319
What
the hell happened?

661
00:49:45.352 --> 00:49:46.788
- Is he sick?
- I don't-

662
00:49:46.821 --> 00:49:48.021
- You don't what?

663
00:49:48.055 --> 00:49:50.057
Okay, do we need to pump
his stomach or what?

664
00:49:51.659 --> 00:49:52.627
Ellis.

665
00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:53.460
What?

666
00:49:53.494 --> 00:49:54.495
Oh, for Christ's sake!

667
00:49:54.529 --> 00:49:55.897
What is going on?

668
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.966
There's nothing!

669
00:49:59.066 --> 00:49:59.868
Ellis.

670
00:50:00.768 --> 00:50:01.536
French is,

671
00:50:02.837 --> 00:50:04.304
his head.

672
00:50:04.338 --> 00:50:05.607
Jane, I need you

673
00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:07.942
to check your phone for
service, wifi, anything.

674
00:50:07.976 --> 00:50:08.843
Jane, please!

675
00:50:08.877 --> 00:50:09.978
We need to help him.

676
00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:10.845
I'm not
getting anything.

677
00:50:10.879 --> 00:50:12.246
We have to go.

678
00:50:12.279 --> 00:50:13.515
No, not without French!

679
00:50:13.548 --> 00:50:14.949
- French is-
- No, he's not!

680
00:50:14.983 --> 00:50:17.050
Listen to me!

681
00:50:17.084 --> 00:50:20.522
Whatever did that to him
might still be in this school!

682
00:50:20.555 --> 00:50:21.455
We're not leaving without him!

683
00:50:21.488 --> 00:50:23.323
We can't reach anything!

684
00:50:23.357 --> 00:50:24.626
We're not
leaving without him!

685
00:50:24.659 --> 00:50:25.860
- We have to!
- No!

686
00:50:31.566 --> 00:50:35.035
That's enough, we're leaving!

687
00:50:45.245 --> 00:50:46.280
Shit!

688
00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:47.849
What's that?

689
00:50:47.882 --> 00:50:48.716
- Brody.
- What?

690
00:50:49.684 --> 00:50:51.351
That goddamn freak.

691
00:50:51.385 --> 00:50:52.587
What the fuck is happening?

692
00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:53.922
The entire
across the school.

693
00:50:53.955 --> 00:50:55.322
No, wait what about?

694
00:50:55.355 --> 00:50:56.558
Just go!

695
00:50:59.393 --> 00:51:00.562
I saw Brody.

696
00:51:00.595 --> 00:51:03.565
He was dressed up as
the stupid mascot,

697
00:51:03.598 --> 00:51:05.065
goddamn Anvil Al!

698
00:51:07.067 --> 00:51:11.238
How the hell do I break this
shit window so I can kill him?

699
00:51:11.271 --> 00:51:13.073
You can't, it's polycore.

700
00:51:13.106 --> 00:51:14.876
What the fuck does that mean?

701
00:51:14.909 --> 00:51:16.544
It's reinforced
security glass,

702
00:51:16.578 --> 00:51:18.445
shatterproof, bulletproof.

703
00:51:18.478 --> 00:51:20.548
They set them up all over the
school with the new gates.

704
00:51:20.582 --> 00:51:21.716
And the new locks.

705
00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:23.785
Well, fuck!

706
00:51:24.953 --> 00:51:27.722
Okay, so we can't
get high school brains.

707
00:51:27.755 --> 00:51:29.356
We have to think.

708
00:51:29.389 --> 00:51:31.491
There's no service, no wifi.

709
00:51:31.526 --> 00:51:33.061
No fire alarms,
no fire detectors.

710
00:51:33.093 --> 00:51:34.328
I was gonna say that.

711
00:51:34.361 --> 00:51:35.228
And the
landlines are down.

712
00:51:35.262 --> 00:51:37.197
Wait, what about the vents?

713
00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:38.198
We could use those.

714
00:51:41.069 --> 00:51:43.370
Do you really think you're
gonna fit in there, dickhead?

715
00:51:43.403 --> 00:51:44.606
And how would that actually
get us out of here?

716
00:51:44.639 --> 00:51:46.273
Where do you think we
are, Jurassic Park?

717
00:51:46.306 --> 00:51:47.441
Right, 'cause you're
just pouring forth

718
00:51:47.474 --> 00:51:49.443
such incredibly
intelligent strategies

719
00:51:49.476 --> 00:51:51.445
to get us out of here,
aren't you, Nadia?

720
00:51:51.478 --> 00:51:53.380
You just think you're so
fucking smart, don't you?

721
00:51:53.413 --> 00:51:54.949
You just think you're
above everybody else!

722
00:51:54.983 --> 00:51:56.316
Now is not-

723
00:51:56.350 --> 00:51:57.619
- Well, maybe you should
just bust down that wall

724
00:51:57.652 --> 00:51:59.186
over there with your
massive, chiseled biceps,

725
00:51:59.219 --> 00:52:00.521
like you always do?

726
00:52:00.555 --> 00:52:01.556
Why don't you
just mind-blast it

727
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:02.590
with your incredible
mental powers

728
00:52:02.624 --> 00:52:04.092
and masculine superiority?

729
00:52:04.124 --> 00:52:05.425
Yeah, well, maybe if
you didn't get French

730
00:52:05.459 --> 00:52:07.260
so fucked up, none of
this would've happened!

731
00:52:07.294 --> 00:52:09.396
Maybe if you didn't
fucking bring us here,

732
00:52:09.429 --> 00:52:10.430
he wouldn't be dead!

733
00:52:10.464 --> 00:52:11.866
Shut the fuck up!

734
00:52:15.202 --> 00:52:17.404
We don't know if all
the doors are locked.

735
00:52:17.437 --> 00:52:19.107
Maybe one isn't.

736
00:52:19.139 --> 00:52:20.942
It's midnight, so
the cleaning people,

737
00:52:20.975 --> 00:52:22.409
they come in on
Saturday's right?

738
00:52:22.442 --> 00:52:23.511
Not until eight.

739
00:52:25.079 --> 00:52:26.446
This is such bullshit.

740
00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:27.949
We're stuck inside of a school

741
00:52:27.982 --> 00:52:30.518
made of millions of dollars
of bulletproof glass,

742
00:52:30.551 --> 00:52:33.588
locks, and cameras, to what?

743
00:52:33.621 --> 00:52:35.255
To keep us safe?

744
00:52:37.692 --> 00:52:39.292
Screw this.

745
00:52:39.326 --> 00:52:42.195
Brody has to have a key, so
everybody grab something.

746
00:52:42.229 --> 00:52:44.999
We'll fuck him up, get
the keys, and get out.

747
00:52:45.033 --> 00:52:46.433
Wouldn't it be
safer if we stay

748
00:52:46.466 --> 00:52:47.669
and just wait for janitors?

749
00:52:49.837 --> 00:52:53.173
If you wanna hide like a
rat, be my fucking guest.

750
00:52:53.206 --> 00:52:54.542
Ellis?

751
00:52:56.978 --> 00:52:58.378
Ellis!

752
00:53:01.582 --> 00:53:03.316
- Wait, okay-
- Can we reboot the security

753
00:53:03.350 --> 00:53:05.452
cameras to track where he is?

754
00:53:05.485 --> 00:53:07.287
I killed the
system for 12 hours.

755
00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:08.422
I didn't know how else to do it.

756
00:53:08.455 --> 00:53:09.356
Suck my tits.

757
00:53:11.726 --> 00:53:14.327
If we find an open
door, I'm taking it

758
00:53:14.361 --> 00:53:16.130
and driving the
hell out of here.

759
00:53:16.164 --> 00:53:18.700
I'm not revenging or
waiting for anyone.

760
00:53:18.733 --> 00:53:19.534
Got it?

761
00:53:22.503 --> 00:53:23.504
Well?

762
00:54:27.467 --> 00:54:28.368
Fuck.

763
00:54:58.266 --> 00:55:01.269
Oh, fuck!

764
00:56:07.702 --> 00:56:08.703
Fuck!

765
00:56:15.743 --> 00:56:17.645
Ellis, what?

766
00:56:17.678 --> 00:56:20.014
Let's go, come on,
come on, let's go.

767
00:56:20.047 --> 00:56:20.882
Nadia.

768
00:56:22.850 --> 00:56:24.518
What if it's not Brody?

769
00:56:24.552 --> 00:56:25.519
What if it's Rakowski?

770
00:56:25.553 --> 00:56:26.654
- What the fuck?
- Listen to me,

771
00:56:26.687 --> 00:56:28.723
Frenchy, he found
her diary earlier,

772
00:56:28.756 --> 00:56:30.224
and it said some
really weird shit.

773
00:56:30.258 --> 00:56:32.226
She's in charge of the
mascot, and she's into axes.

774
00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:33.261
Ellis, it's Brody.

775
00:56:34.896 --> 00:56:35.763
What if it's not?

776
00:56:35.796 --> 00:56:36.831
Guys, let's go.

777
00:56:38.766 --> 00:56:40.334
Nadia, I just want you to be-

778
00:56:40.368 --> 00:56:41.434
- What?

779
00:56:41.468 --> 00:56:42.270
Safe?

780
00:56:43.771 --> 00:56:44.772
Smart.

781
00:56:45.606 --> 00:56:48.309
Let's go, guys.

782
00:56:51.712 --> 00:56:52.713
Shit.

783
00:56:54.749 --> 00:56:58.586
Jane, do you
have a phone we can use?

784
00:56:58.619 --> 00:57:00.388
Hold on, I've
got something else.

785
00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:02.256
Hurry up, Jane!

786
00:58:00.648 --> 00:58:02.049
For God's sake.

787
00:58:11.892 --> 00:58:13.427
Shit!

788
00:58:15.997 --> 00:58:17.331
Merritt, wait.

789
00:58:18.532 --> 00:58:19.834
I found this note in my locker.

790
00:58:19.867 --> 00:58:22.603
Listen, I think, I really think

791
00:58:22.636 --> 00:58:24.705
it's not Rakowski or Brody.

792
00:58:25.639 --> 00:58:27.875
You need to stop.

793
00:58:27.908 --> 00:58:30.144
Merritt, he's the only
one who would do this.

794
00:58:30.177 --> 00:58:32.513
I don't give a
shit who it is, okay?

795
00:58:32.546 --> 00:58:34.415
I just wanna get the
hell out of here.

796
00:58:36.817 --> 00:58:37.585
Merritt.

797
00:59:50.224 --> 00:59:52.126
Please, please, please.

798
00:59:57.231 --> 00:59:58.032
Shit.

799
01:00:46.714 --> 01:00:47.948
What the hell?

800
01:00:49.618 --> 01:00:50.751
Fiddle music.

801
01:00:50.784 --> 01:00:51.652
What?

802
01:00:51.685 --> 01:00:52.621
I've had enough of this shit!

803
01:00:52.653 --> 01:00:54.121
- Hey, Brody!
- Stop!

804
01:00:54.155 --> 01:00:55.823
Brody!

805
01:00:55.856 --> 01:00:59.160
Stop playing your psycho-ass
music and come out and fight!

806
01:00:59.193 --> 01:01:00.661
Nadia, shut up.

807
01:01:02.796 --> 01:01:03.931
Oh my God.

808
01:01:05.399 --> 01:01:06.934
Holy shit.

809
01:01:14.708 --> 01:01:15.976
Run!

810
01:01:20.114 --> 01:01:22.016
- Are you all right?
- No, my ankle!

811
01:01:24.018 --> 01:01:25.252
Shit!

812
01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:30.625
Nadia.

813
01:01:31.992 --> 01:01:33.194
Nadia, what are you doing?

814
01:01:38.365 --> 01:01:39.833
Nadia!

815
01:01:43.304 --> 01:01:45.005
- You killed him!
- Nadia!

816
01:01:45.039 --> 01:01:46.941
- You killed him!
- Nadia, no!

817
01:01:53.414 --> 01:01:54.715
No, no, no, no!

818
01:02:07.094 --> 01:02:08.362
He's coming!

819
01:02:09.797 --> 01:02:11.098
Ellis, we have to check
the rest of the doors.

820
01:02:11.131 --> 01:02:13.734
- Ellis, come on!
- I can't get up!

821
01:02:13.767 --> 01:02:15.670
Don't leave me!

822
01:02:15.704 --> 01:02:16.937
Wait, you guys!

823
01:02:30.951 --> 01:02:32.820
No, no, no, no, no.

824
01:02:32.853 --> 01:02:33.722
Please, no.

825
01:02:35.724 --> 01:02:37.024
Get up.

826
01:02:37.057 --> 01:02:38.158
It hurts.

827
01:02:38.192 --> 01:02:39.393
Do it!

828
01:02:48.202 --> 01:02:50.371
Ellis, come on,
help me out here.

829
01:03:00.247 --> 01:03:01.616
The other one.

830
01:03:03.117 --> 01:03:04.118
Don't go.

831
01:03:04.151 --> 01:03:05.520
Wait, come back.

832
01:03:07.154 --> 01:03:08.222
Please.

833
01:03:20.167 --> 01:03:21.335
Okay.

834
01:03:23.237 --> 01:03:24.104
We're safe.

835
01:04:06.581 --> 01:04:07.782
Does it hurt?

836
01:04:09.883 --> 01:04:10.685
It's fine.

837
01:04:18.359 --> 01:04:23.364
So, I think about that
camping trip all the time.

838
01:04:29.403 --> 01:04:31.271
It's like I can see us there,

839
01:04:33.407 --> 01:04:38.212
and we're with my mom,

840
01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:48.122
and I'm looking up at all
of those really tall trees.

841
01:04:52.159 --> 01:04:53.561
I wish we could go back there.

842
01:04:56.196 --> 01:04:57.231
- Merritt-
- Stop.

843
01:04:59.333 --> 01:05:02.302
- Please, don't shut me-
- Just stop.

844
01:05:48.783 --> 01:05:49.751
Go away.

845
01:06:00.294 --> 01:06:02.196
Look up, Jane, look up.

846
01:06:11.573 --> 01:06:12.372
See her?

847
01:06:14.308 --> 01:06:19.279
That girl there, I've seen
what she's really about.

848
01:06:21.549 --> 01:06:22.884
I think you should see it, too.

849
01:06:25.152 --> 01:06:26.186
I should've just...

850
01:06:29.223 --> 01:06:30.224
I don't know.

851
01:06:34.529 --> 01:06:36.163
It's not your fault, Jane.

852
01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:41.503
It's not.

853
01:06:53.313 --> 01:06:57.050
Ellis!

854
01:06:57.084 --> 01:06:58.520
Jane.

855
01:07:10.598 --> 01:07:12.099
Oh my God.

856
01:07:23.343 --> 01:07:24.344
Where's Ellis?

857
01:07:28.783 --> 01:07:30.150
Come on.

858
01:07:30.183 --> 01:07:31.385
Where's Ellis?

859
01:07:31.418 --> 01:07:32.419
We have to go!

860
01:07:34.221 --> 01:07:35.155
It's him!

861
01:07:35.188 --> 01:07:36.089
Let's go!

862
01:07:36.925 --> 01:07:38.492
Where are we going?

863
01:07:38.526 --> 01:07:39.694
We have to go faster.

864
01:07:39.727 --> 01:07:40.528
Ow!

865
01:07:41.461 --> 01:07:42.496
Oh my God!

866
01:07:44.097 --> 01:07:45.399
Just a little further.

867
01:07:45.432 --> 01:07:47.167
- I can't, Jane!
- Yes, you can!

868
01:07:58.813 --> 01:07:59.581
We have to go.

869
01:07:59.614 --> 01:08:00.748
- Are you crazy?
- We have to go.

870
01:08:29.744 --> 01:08:34.381
Okay, okay.

871
01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:42.824
Jane.

872
01:08:58.438 --> 01:09:01.509
So, what, we just
wait until he pops

873
01:09:01.542 --> 01:09:03.477
out again and pulverizes us?

874
01:09:05.445 --> 01:09:06.246
Hello?

875
01:09:08.616 --> 01:09:12.620
Ow!

876
01:09:27.802 --> 01:09:30.470
Jane, where's Ellis?

877
01:09:32.674 --> 01:09:33.841
Tell me.

878
01:09:43.417 --> 01:09:45.318
This is all because of you.

879
01:09:52.426 --> 01:09:54.162
- Because of me?
- Oh, shut up.

880
01:09:55.563 --> 01:09:56.496
You know what you did,

881
01:09:57.699 --> 01:10:00.168
acting all helpless
with Aunspach.

882
01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:02.235
"Oh, Merritt, I don't
know what to do.

883
01:10:02.269 --> 01:10:03.671
"Merritt, help me, Merritt.

884
01:10:03.705 --> 01:10:05.472
"Oh, Merritt, oh, I'm so weak."

885
01:10:05.506 --> 01:10:06.974
He touched me.

886
01:10:07.008 --> 01:10:11.612
Oh, you loved it, right
until he got too close.

887
01:10:12.847 --> 01:10:15.717
So I saved the day,
even though you made

888
01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:19.286
me look like the asshole
when I told you not to.

889
01:10:20.621 --> 01:10:22.523
I told you
not to tell anyone.

890
01:10:22.557 --> 01:10:25.693
Even though you stole
the only guy I ever liked.

891
01:10:25.727 --> 01:10:26.594
I didn't!

892
01:10:26.627 --> 01:10:29.063
Even though I'm the one, me,

893
01:10:29.097 --> 01:10:32.365
who got Aunspach's
dick out of your face.

894
01:10:32.399 --> 01:10:34.468
Because you
want to go to Princeton,

895
01:10:34.502 --> 01:10:35.737
you wanted that trust fund.

896
01:10:35.770 --> 01:10:37.872
Because I was your new mom!

897
01:10:41.441 --> 01:10:44.478
I got you friends
and play dates.

898
01:10:46.047 --> 01:10:49.550
I protected you, I
stood up for you.

899
01:10:49.584 --> 01:10:51.919
I cleaned your clothes,

900
01:10:51.953 --> 01:10:56.057
while you got to be the
little wonder-ass genius.

901
01:11:00.393 --> 01:11:02.797
"Why can't you be more
like Jane, Merritt?

902
01:11:04.198 --> 01:11:06.868
"She doesn't look like
cousin fucking Greg.

903
01:11:06.901 --> 01:11:09.369
"She doesn't gain
fucking water weight.

904
01:11:09.402 --> 01:11:10.571
"She could get into Princeton

905
01:11:10.605 --> 01:11:13.841
"with her sparkling
fucking eyes closed.

906
01:11:15.109 --> 01:11:16.944
"Why can't you be
smart and polite

907
01:11:16.978 --> 01:11:19.714
"and perfect and tiny
and virginal like her?

908
01:11:19.747 --> 01:11:20.948
"What's wrong with you?"

909
01:11:23.885 --> 01:11:24.752
Well, guess what?

910
01:11:26.587 --> 01:11:27.420
I'm the cool one.

911
01:11:28.656 --> 01:11:31.225
I'm pretty and rich.

912
01:11:31.259 --> 01:11:34.695
Everyone wants to be my
friend and hook up with me,

913
01:11:34.729 --> 01:11:38.266
and you're not
better than me, okay?

914
01:11:38.298 --> 01:11:40.768
Nothing about you
is better than me.

915
01:11:41.936 --> 01:11:43.805
- Not your clothes.
- Stop, please.

916
01:11:43.838 --> 01:11:46.541
Or your voice or your hair.

917
01:11:46.574 --> 01:11:49.043
- Stop it!
- Or your body or your face.

918
01:11:49.076 --> 01:11:53.346
You're just sad,
small, and pathetic.

919
01:11:55.516 --> 01:11:56.717
- Shut up!
- Ow!

920
01:11:56.751 --> 01:11:58.286
- You little-
- You just shut up!

921
01:11:58.318 --> 01:11:59.086
Jane!

922
01:11:59.120 --> 01:11:59.921
Shut up!

923
01:13:39.754 --> 01:13:43.157
Jane, good to see you.

924
01:13:46.961 --> 01:13:48.162
Snickerdoodle?

925
01:13:49.931 --> 01:13:51.966
Miss Taylor baked these.

926
01:13:54.302 --> 01:13:55.202
They're very good.

927
01:14:02.743 --> 01:14:03.711
What do you want?

928
01:14:06.614 --> 01:14:11.619
You know, I thought that
our last talk was enough,

929
01:14:13.988 --> 01:14:16.891
but you needed something more,
so that's what I gave you.

930
01:14:18.491 --> 01:14:20.795
I didn't need
anything from you.

931
01:14:28.936 --> 01:14:31.572
How did you feel when
you pushed Miss Sinclair?

932
01:14:33.774 --> 01:14:35.977
Do you think you could've
done that before?

933
01:14:38.946 --> 01:14:40.247
They held you back, Jane.

934
01:14:42.482 --> 01:14:44.852
They lowered you to their level.

935
01:14:44.885 --> 01:14:47.989
Anyone could see that,
except for yourself.

936
01:14:48.022 --> 01:14:51.459
But, tonight, that all changed.

937
01:14:53.127 --> 01:14:56.496
You outlasted every single
one of those fiddlers,

938
01:14:56.530 --> 01:14:59.867
and, now, you are free of them.

939
01:15:01.268 --> 01:15:03.337
You picked up the hammer.

940
01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:09.176
And you will accomplish every
exceptional piece of work

941
01:15:09.210 --> 01:15:10.745
that I know you're capable of,

942
01:15:10.778 --> 01:15:12.847
that I know you were born to do,

943
01:15:13.848 --> 01:15:18.786
because, my dearest
Jane, you are special.

944
01:15:27.828 --> 01:15:31.399
Oh, I forgot.

945
01:15:33.234 --> 01:15:34.235
I hope it's in here.

946
01:15:35.970 --> 01:15:40.975
Oh, motherfucker.

947
01:15:42.511 --> 01:15:43.277
Oh.

948
01:15:47.214 --> 01:15:48.916
You dropped this the other day,

949
01:15:50.551 --> 01:15:52.920
so I held onto it for you.

950
01:16:01.262 --> 01:16:06.267
I'll give it back
if you thank me.

951
01:16:07.001 --> 01:16:09.437
How about it?

952
01:16:10.938 --> 01:16:13.542
Thank a man for caring
as much as I have,

953
01:16:14.742 --> 01:16:17.211
for teaching you how
to become a woman.

954
01:16:44.905 --> 01:16:46.273
You know what?

955
01:16:49.143 --> 01:16:50.811
I have learned something.

956
01:16:54.448 --> 01:16:55.749
I'm not pathetic!

957
01:17:23.512 --> 01:17:25.012
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

958
01:18:08.989 --> 01:18:10.824
Yes!

959
01:18:38.085 --> 01:18:39.654
No!

960
01:18:39.688 --> 01:18:41.590
You just won't
learn, will you?

961
01:20:41.108 --> 01:20:42.076
Jane.

962
01:22:04.158 --> 01:22:05.159
Oh, shit.

963
01:22:10.464 --> 01:22:11.432
What the?

964
01:23:12.359 --> 01:23:17.359
