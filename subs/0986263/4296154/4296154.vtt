00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.338
<i>Look at yourselves.</i>

2
00:00:35.504 --> 00:00:38.770
<i>Unplug from your chairs,
get up and look in the mirror.</i>

3
00:00:39.675 --> 00:00:42.827
<i>What you see is how God made you.</i>

4
00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.724
<i>We're not meant to experience
the world through a machine.</i>

5
00:01:00.917 --> 00:01:04.324
<i>What you're telling me is,
a monkey is operating this arm</i>

6
00:01:04.425 --> 00:01:06.208
<i>with nothing but his thoughts?</i>

7
00:01:06.208 --> 00:01:07.626
<i>Absolutely.</i>

8
00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:12.895
<i>There are 100 sensors,</i>

9
00:01:12.895 --> 00:01:15.916
<i>each listening to a different
brain cell or neuron.</i>

10
00:01:19.183 --> 00:01:22.260
<i>Physically disabled people
will be able to operate.</i>

11
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.847
<i>Fully synthetic bodies.</i>

12
00:01:24.847 --> 00:01:27.621
<i>It provides a tremendous amount
of hope for the future.</i>

13
00:01:32.222 --> 00:01:34.774
<i>Because of the technology that
we have, at a time of war</i>

14
00:01:34.774 --> 00:01:36.877
<i>we're going to start seeing
this more and more.</i>

15
00:01:36.877 --> 00:01:40.995
<i>As manufacturing capacity expanded
for military and industrial use</i>

16
00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:43.829
<i>Surrogates became affordable
to the general public</i>

17
00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.322
<i>Causing a revolution in how we live.</i>

18
00:01:47.231 --> 00:01:50.635
<i>The ability to leave your home
without risk of disease or injury</i>

19
00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:54.742
<i>To have perfect looks without trips
to the gym or plastic surgery</i>

20
00:01:54.742 --> 00:01:58.117
<i>There is no question that at some point
they will be persons like anyone else</i>

21
00:01:58.218 --> 00:02:01.310
<i>They will not be human, but that
they will be part of our community?</i>

22
00:02:01.483 --> 00:02:02.982
<i>There is no question in my mind.</i>

23
00:02:03.063 --> 00:02:05.504
<i>The decision came down 5 to 4.</i>

24
00:02:05.567 --> 00:02:09.390
<i>That the Supreme Court ruled in favor
of the use of surrogates in daily life.</i>

25
00:02:13.822 --> 00:02:16.872
<i>Right now, we are witnessing an event.</i>

26
00:02:16.872 --> 00:02:19.444
<i>That is of an evolutionary significance</i>

27
00:02:21.747 --> 00:02:25.557
<i>According to VSI, the industries
leading manufacturer,</i>

28
00:02:25.758 --> 00:02:28.205
<i>over 98% of the world population</i>

29
00:02:28.405 --> 00:02:31.913
<i>uses a surrogate in all
facets of their daily life.</i>

30
00:02:34.743 --> 00:02:36.629
<i>We're in the midst of profound changes,</i>

31
00:02:36.654 --> 00:02:39.836
<i>that are things that were once
unimaginable have become inevitable.</i>

32
00:02:39.836 --> 00:02:42.172
<i>Since the global embrace of surrogacy</i>

33
00:02:42.373 --> 00:02:44.472
<i>crime rates have dropped to record lows</i>

34
00:02:44.972 --> 00:02:47.973
<i>We have witnessed and incredible
reduction in violent crime</i>

35
00:02:48.173 --> 00:02:50.472
<i>communicable disease and discrimination.</i>

36
00:02:50.472 --> 00:02:53.273
<i>Problems that have plagued
societies for centuries</i>

37
00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:55.372
<i>solved almost overnight.</i>

38
00:02:55.372 --> 00:02:56.873
<i>We are the creators.</i>

39
00:02:57.173 --> 00:02:59.273
<i>We will be making them.</i>

40
00:02:59.373 --> 00:03:01.572
<i>Do everything for us.
All in one machine.</i>

41
00:03:04.373 --> 00:03:07.672
<i>But there is a minority
who actively oppose Surrogates</i>

42
00:03:07.673 --> 00:03:09.773
<i>and are moving to limit their use.</i>

43
00:03:11.573 --> 00:03:13.673
<i>Many people will see this,</i>

44
00:03:13.673 --> 00:03:17.274
<i>as the invasion of the inhuman.</i>

45
00:03:18.473 --> 00:03:21.374
<i>They have established reservations
or surrogacy free zones</i>

46
00:03:21.374 --> 00:03:23.673
<i>in major cities around the country.</i>

47
00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:29.773
<i>They are led by Zaire Powell</i>

48
00:03:29.773 --> 00:03:31.774
<i>or as he is better known to his followers</i>

49
00:03:31.774 --> 00:03:32.874
<i>The Prophet.</i>

50
00:03:32.874 --> 00:03:35.374
<i>Those machines walking around out there</i>

51
00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:36.874
<i>They're a lie.</i>

52
00:03:40.974 --> 00:03:43.874
<i>You have been sold a lie.</i>

53
00:03:54.475 --> 00:03:56.774
<i>You're going to love Tosca.</i>

54
00:03:56.875 --> 00:03:58.875
Alright, but don't tell me how it ends.

55
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.575
<i>The way they all end.
Everyone dies.</i>

56
00:04:03.675 --> 00:04:06.875
<i>I am so glad you could
come back east for a visit.</i>

57
00:04:06.975 --> 00:04:09.375
Well, anything for a break from exams.

58
00:04:10.175 --> 00:04:11.475
We're almost there.

59
00:04:11.975 --> 00:04:14.475
Listen, thanks for lending him to me.

60
00:04:14.475 --> 00:04:15.875
<i>Have a wonderful time.</i>

61
00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:18.076
<i>I love you.</i>

62
00:04:18.376 --> 00:04:19.875
I love you too Dad.

63
00:04:28.976 --> 00:04:30.176
You know Armando.

64
00:04:30.475 --> 00:04:32.076
I am not really in the mood for opera.

65
00:04:33.476 --> 00:04:34.576
Four Point?

66
00:04:35.876 --> 00:04:37.276
You read my mind.

67
00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:27.780
Get lost meat-bag.

68
00:07:13.781 --> 00:07:15.081
I am agent Peters.

69
00:07:15.781 --> 00:07:18.081
This is Agent Greer, FBI.

70
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:22.181
Yeah, some jackass on a motorcycle
wiped out a bunch of units.

71
00:07:22.181 --> 00:07:23.782
So what do you need us for?

72
00:07:24.282 --> 00:07:26.781
Well I was going to file just
a vandalism report,

73
00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:28.982
but it turns out this unit's unregistered.

74
00:07:36.282 --> 00:07:38.282
Looks like it's going to need new optics.

75
00:07:38.982 --> 00:07:40.082
No shit.

76
00:07:53.594 --> 00:07:55.693
The identity chip is completely fried.

77
00:07:56.593 --> 00:07:57.694
What you got on the girl?

78
00:07:57.694 --> 00:08:01.193
Registered to a Cameron
McAllister out in Worcester.

79
00:08:01.193 --> 00:08:02.493
She file a report?

80
00:08:02.793 --> 00:08:05.392
No, that's just it, no calls, no nothing

81
00:08:19.792 --> 00:08:21.093
Come on.

82
00:08:21.593 --> 00:08:23.492
Let's go talk to our operator.

83
00:08:35.092 --> 00:08:35.992
Cam?

84
00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:39.391
Maybe nobody's home.

85
00:08:44.491 --> 00:08:46.092
My Surries in for an upgrade

86
00:08:46.092 --> 00:08:47.392
and they gave me this crappy loaner.

87
00:08:47.692 --> 00:08:48.692
Could you?

88
00:08:49.192 --> 00:08:49.893
Certainly.

89
00:08:59.091 --> 00:09:00.092
Cam?

90
00:09:02.391 --> 00:09:03.902
Cam's a good tenant you know,

91
00:09:03.902 --> 00:09:06.392
pays the rent on time,
never leaves the apartment.

92
00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:23.392
Cam?

93
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:26.490
Cam?

94
00:09:28.691 --> 00:09:29.990
Oh my God!

95
00:09:32.591 --> 00:09:34.191
Don't touch anything, please.

96
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.290
I will call it in.

97
00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.490
You're sure this is Cameron McAllister?
Yes!

98
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:56.712
This is Agent Peters,

99
00:09:56.713 --> 00:09:58.814
we tracked down the blonde's operator.

100
00:10:00.789 --> 00:10:01.590
Yeah.

101
00:10:03.389 --> 00:10:04.689
Better send a coroner.

102
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:14.890
Have you ever seen anything like this?

103
00:13:11.084 --> 00:13:13.450
Morning.
Hey.

104
00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:14.385
Oh! Where's your...

105
00:13:14.984 --> 00:13:16.284
In the charge room.

106
00:13:29.384 --> 00:13:30.885
You pull another all nighter?

107
00:13:31.984 --> 00:13:32.984
Yes I did.

108
00:13:35.884 --> 00:13:37.483
Why don't you think
about taking a break?

109
00:13:38.483 --> 00:13:39.583
A break?

110
00:13:40.584 --> 00:13:42.284
I got some vacation time saved up.

111
00:13:42.884 --> 00:13:43.983
How about Hawaii?

112
00:13:44.783 --> 00:13:46.184
Lisa said she got an amazing deal.

113
00:13:46.484 --> 00:13:47.483
Hawaii would be great.

114
00:13:47.484 --> 00:13:49.244
She had this totally buff Surrie in Maui,

115
00:13:49.244 --> 00:13:51.984
she took it surfing, para-sailing,
deep sea diving.

116
00:13:52.483 --> 00:13:54.482
You know that rental place on Boilston?

117
00:13:54.683 --> 00:13:55.812
I was thinking about us.

118
00:13:56.237 --> 00:13:58.107
You and me going away
some place together.

119
00:13:58.483 --> 00:14:00.483
And leave our units at home?
Are you kidding?

120
00:14:03.383 --> 00:14:06.183
We could take a drive out to the Cape?
We haven't done that for a while...

121
00:14:06.183 --> 00:14:07.983
Can we talk about this another time?

122
00:14:08.283 --> 00:14:10.462
You know, I should get to work,
the shops been really busy.

123
00:14:10.462 --> 00:14:12.382
Sure.
Everyone wants new looks for summer.

124
00:14:15.283 --> 00:14:17.282
Yeah, I was just thinking that...

125
00:14:19.483 --> 00:14:20.883
It just feels like we...

126
00:14:22.582 --> 00:14:25.152
Haven't really spent
much time together lately.

127
00:14:25.152 --> 00:14:26.782
We're together every day.

128
00:14:29.082 --> 00:14:31.082
Surrogates, not the same.

129
00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:35.282
It's better.

130
00:14:52.082 --> 00:14:53.582
Yo Canter?

131
00:14:53.982 --> 00:14:55.282
He's been in there all weekend.

132
00:14:55.882 --> 00:14:57.782
He's gonna miss the Psych final.

133
00:15:02.481 --> 00:15:03.581
Jesus!

134
00:15:03.981 --> 00:15:05.381
Somebody call the cops!

135
00:15:06.782 --> 00:15:09.999
We are confronted with an
unprecedented situation.

136
00:15:11.182 --> 00:15:13.981
Two people have died while
connected to their stim chairs.

137
00:15:15.281 --> 00:15:16.821
According to the pathologist,

138
00:15:16.845 --> 00:15:19.804
their brains were
liquefied in their skulls.

139
00:15:20.481 --> 00:15:22.781
Whatever happened to their surrogates,
killed them.

140
00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:25.781
Sir?

141
00:15:26.081 --> 00:15:27.521
How is it even possible?

142
00:15:27.846 --> 00:15:29.105
We don't know.

143
00:15:30.081 --> 00:15:31.981
I am imposing a total media blackout.

144
00:15:32.281 --> 00:15:35.080
No one from this office
is going to be responsible

145
00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.280
for setting off a nationwide panic.

146
00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.380
The public cannot be allowed

147
00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:42.680
to get the idea that using
a surrogate can be fatal.

148
00:15:46.881 --> 00:15:49.280
Tuxedo boys last moments.

149
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.179
<i>Get lost meat bag.</i>

150
00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:58.580
Looks like we got ourselves a witness.

151
00:16:06.279 --> 00:16:07.379
Hang on...

152
00:16:11.979 --> 00:16:12.979
What is that?

153
00:16:13.097 --> 00:16:14.104
Exactly...

154
00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.780
Some kind of weapon.
Anything yet?

155
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:21.724
Hang on to yourself,

156
00:16:22.249 --> 00:16:24.503
I think we may actually
have a homicide here.

157
00:16:25.179 --> 00:16:26.378
Come here and look at this.

158
00:16:26.402 --> 00:16:27.354
Are you serious?

159
00:16:27.479 --> 00:16:28.903
No we don't know that for sure.

160
00:16:29.079 --> 00:16:30.991
Yeah but what if it is a homicide?

161
00:16:31.216 --> 00:16:32.803
When was the last one?

162
00:16:33.779 --> 00:16:35.279
This could be huge.

163
00:16:39.278 --> 00:16:41.479
Yeah, Lee go.
<i>We got your next of kin.</i>

164
00:16:41.779 --> 00:16:43.278
<i>I hope you're sitting down.</i>

165
00:16:43.778 --> 00:16:45.878
<i>The kids father is Lionel Canter.</i>

166
00:16:46.279 --> 00:16:49.199
<i>As in the inventor of surrogates,
Lionel Canter.</i>

167
00:16:51.779 --> 00:16:55.277
<i>Jarid Canter, son of Dr. Lionel Canter
was found dead,</i>

168
00:16:55.278 --> 00:16:57.778
<i>in his Southern California
dormitory this morning</i>

169
00:16:57.778 --> 00:16:59.878
<i>cause of death remains unknown.</i>

170
00:17:00.177 --> 00:17:02.378
<i>A college sophomore,
Jarid was the only son</i>

171
00:17:02.378 --> 00:17:06.079
<i>of the man known around the world
as the father of surrogacy.</i>

172
00:17:06.378 --> 00:17:08.278
<i>The Former Chairman of VSI,</i>

173
00:17:08.378 --> 00:17:11.679
<i>shaped it into one of the largest
corporations in the world.</i>

174
00:17:11.779 --> 00:17:14.977
<i>However, a split between
Canter and his VSI partners,</i>

175
00:17:14.978 --> 00:17:16.578
<i>over the direction of the company,</i>

176
00:17:16.578 --> 00:17:19.377
<i>led to Canters firing seven years ago.</i>

177
00:17:19.878 --> 00:17:23.277
<i>Publicly humiliated and forced out
of the company he helped to build,</i>

178
00:17:23.677 --> 00:17:26.578
<i>Canter has since remained
absent from the public eye.</i>

179
00:17:28.577 --> 00:17:30.377
Dr. Canter's expecting you.

180
00:17:30.777 --> 00:17:32.177
He actually lives here?

181
00:17:32.177 --> 00:17:33.277
I didn't say that.

182
00:17:33.778 --> 00:17:35.677
You will be speaking with
one of his surrogates.

183
00:17:39.078 --> 00:17:40.777
I work for Dr. Canter.

184
00:17:42.077 --> 00:17:43.678
His private elevator is this way.

185
00:17:59.577 --> 00:18:00.577
Please,

186
00:18:01.002 --> 00:18:02.301
wait in here.

187
00:18:05.576 --> 00:18:06.876
What a nice place.

188
00:18:07.677 --> 00:18:08.876
It should be.

189
00:18:10.176 --> 00:18:12.477
It's a piece of every surrogate they sell.

190
00:18:20.575 --> 00:18:21.676
Dr. Canter?

191
00:18:22.076 --> 00:18:23.076
That's right.

192
00:18:23.276 --> 00:18:24.776
You're with the FBI?

193
00:18:25.375 --> 00:18:26.376
Yes we are.

194
00:18:27.076 --> 00:18:28.176
This way.

195
00:18:29.076 --> 00:18:31.376
I can't help but notice
the similarities between

196
00:18:31.376 --> 00:18:33.114
your surrogate and the one your...

197
00:18:33.339 --> 00:18:34.501
son Jared was using.

198
00:18:35.376 --> 00:18:38.175
I never really knew Jarid as a child.

199
00:18:39.575 --> 00:18:42.475
He grew up with his mother in
California who kept him from me.

200
00:18:43.475 --> 00:18:44.413
When he went to college,

201
00:18:44.438 --> 00:18:46.876
I encouraged him to borrow my
surrogates whenever he wanted.

202
00:18:46.876 --> 00:18:48.775
How did you managed to do that?

203
00:18:48.775 --> 00:18:51.376
A Surrie has to be coded
to your neural signature.

204
00:18:51.476 --> 00:18:53.874
I am not exactly your
average VSI consumer.

205
00:18:58.674 --> 00:19:01.075
This was just a way for me
to spend time with my son.

206
00:19:01.375 --> 00:19:05.275
It's a felony to inhabit a surrogate
registered to another operator.

207
00:19:05.475 --> 00:19:06.583
No offense Dr. Canter.

208
00:19:07.208 --> 00:19:09.323
We're just trying
to straighten out our facts.

209
00:19:09.376 --> 00:19:10.774
What is this?

210
00:19:11.374 --> 00:19:13.374
Some kind of Good Cop, Bad Cop routine?
No sir.

211
00:19:13.374 --> 00:19:15.174
You trying to handle me?
No sir.

212
00:19:15.175 --> 00:19:16.574
Because I am not going to be handled.

213
00:19:16.874 --> 00:19:17.874
Dr Canter.

214
00:19:18.474 --> 00:19:20.775
I know how you must feel.
Do you?

215
00:19:21.474 --> 00:19:22.574
Yes, sir.

216
00:19:23.675 --> 00:19:25.375
I lost a son myself.

217
00:19:36.774 --> 00:19:39.474
Do you have any idea why
someone might want to harm Jared?

218
00:19:45.873 --> 00:19:46.673
No.

219
00:19:47.674 --> 00:19:48.574
Or yourself?

220
00:19:54.374 --> 00:19:55.473
Oh my God.

221
00:19:57.074 --> 00:19:58.774
If it was me they were after...

222
00:20:00.373 --> 00:20:02.473
I am responsible for my son's death.

223
00:20:10.673 --> 00:20:13.473
Well, I guess the interview's over.

224
00:20:33.272 --> 00:20:34.172
No!

225
00:20:37.372 --> 00:20:41.172
<i>Robotic surrogates combine
the durability of machines.</i>

226
00:20:41.472 --> 00:20:43.972
<i>With the grace and beauty
of the human form.</i>

227
00:20:44.373 --> 00:20:45.972
<i>To make your life safer</i>

228
00:20:46.272 --> 00:20:47.172
<i>And better.</i>

229
00:20:47.172 --> 00:20:50.872
<i>Whether your budget allows
for simplified generic or our...</i>

230
00:20:50.872 --> 00:20:54.772
<i>Get ready to live your life
without any risk or danger.</i>

231
00:20:55.072 --> 00:20:58.071
<i>You can live your life without limitations.</i>

232
00:20:58.672 --> 00:21:01.072
<i>And become anyone you want to be.</i>

233
00:21:01.072 --> 00:21:03.772
<i>From the comfort and
safety of your own home.</i>

234
00:21:04.172 --> 00:21:06.571
<i>VSI, where it all began.</i>

235
00:21:07.371 --> 00:21:08.788
<i>Do what you want.</i>

236
00:21:09.013 --> 00:21:10.495
<i>Be what you want.</i>

237
00:21:11.671 --> 00:21:12.941
Agents Greer and Peters?

238
00:21:13.166 --> 00:21:14.199
I am Victor Welsh.

239
00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:15.971
VP of corporate relations.

240
00:21:16.371 --> 00:21:17.471
Please sit.

241
00:21:17.872 --> 00:21:20.771
Thanks for taking the time to see us.
No problem.

242
00:21:21.871 --> 00:21:24.071
You... You must know Andy Stone?

243
00:21:24.271 --> 00:21:25.570
Our immediate superior.

244
00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.170
Do give him my regards.

245
00:21:27.571 --> 00:21:30.870
We're from the legal department.
Hope you don't mind if we sit in.

246
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:31.570
Not at all.

247
00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:33.721
The two of you might be interested
in a free software upgrade...

248
00:21:33.721 --> 00:21:35.871
we're offering all law enforcement officials.

249
00:21:35.871 --> 00:21:39.971
Better night vision for your synth units.
Improved pursuit capability.

250
00:21:39.971 --> 00:21:43.770
You have any idea how a surrogates
head would explode from the inside?

251
00:21:47.271 --> 00:21:49.970
Mr. Welsh isn't qualified
to answer that question.

252
00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:51.771
What do the operators say?

253
00:21:52.171 --> 00:21:53.170
Not much.

254
00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:54.670
They're dead.

255
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:57.589
If you're trying to imply
a link between VSI products

256
00:21:57.589 --> 00:21:58.999
and an operators accidental death.

257
00:21:58.999 --> 00:22:00.569
I am not implying anything.

258
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:03.109
I just want to know how an operator

259
00:22:03.109 --> 00:22:05.259
can be killed by signals from it's surrogate.

260
00:22:05.259 --> 00:22:06.840
This idea itself is absurd.

261
00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:10.199
If it were possible it would defeat
the entire purpose of surrogacy.

262
00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:13.450
Surries have jumped from bridges.
Been shot,

263
00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:16.609
even blown to bits without the
least bit of harm to their operators.

264
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:18.769
The failsafes always kick in.

265
00:22:18.969 --> 00:22:20.669
I can assure you VSI's products

266
00:22:20.669 --> 00:22:23.169
have the most stringent safety
standards in the industry.

267
00:22:23.169 --> 00:22:24.570
What about a human head?

268
00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:27.469
What would cause one of them to blow up?

269
00:22:27.869 --> 00:22:29.069
Agent Greer.

270
00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:30.869
We're not doctors.

271
00:22:31.369 --> 00:22:32.169
Honey...

272
00:22:32.469 --> 00:22:33.968
I don't know what you are.

273
00:22:34.869 --> 00:22:37.379
I mean for all I know you
could be some big fat dude

274
00:22:37.379 --> 00:22:39.999
sitting in a stim chair
with his dick hanging out.

275
00:22:58.869 --> 00:23:00.569
Interesting technique.

276
00:23:01.468 --> 00:23:02.869
I hate lawyers.

277
00:23:09.168 --> 00:23:10.268
What are you doing?

278
00:23:25.967 --> 00:23:27.268
Mr. Steinberg?

279
00:23:28.668 --> 00:23:30.267
Seth Steinberg?

280
00:23:33.968 --> 00:23:34.767
Hello.

281
00:23:35.067 --> 00:23:35.968
Sorry.

282
00:23:35.968 --> 00:23:37.267
I was in the can.

283
00:23:37.267 --> 00:23:39.667
This is Agent Peters,
I am Agent Greer with the FBI.

284
00:23:40.366 --> 00:23:41.167
Really?

285
00:23:44.667 --> 00:23:46.467
An identity chip this damaged.

286
00:23:46.867 --> 00:23:48.967
Every circuit must have fired off at once.

287
00:23:49.367 --> 00:23:50.368
Kablooey!

288
00:23:51.068 --> 00:23:53.267
Have you ever seen anything
like this before?

289
00:23:53.366 --> 00:23:57.700
Last week a truck load of GI Joes
did come back for re-conditioning.

290
00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.267
And a couple of the
Surries were missing optics.

291
00:24:00.667 --> 00:24:02.167
Mind if we take a look at them?

292
00:24:17.266 --> 00:24:18.566
Here we go.

293
00:24:29.966 --> 00:24:32.665
No bullet holes?
No blast damage?

294
00:24:33.466 --> 00:24:35.966
No scratches.
No dirt. No mud.

295
00:24:36.366 --> 00:24:38.366
Mind if I check out the identity chip?

296
00:24:40.166 --> 00:24:41.266
Why not?

297
00:24:41.566 --> 00:24:42.999
Didn't come back with one.

298
00:25:03.579 --> 00:25:04.477
I am down!

299
00:25:04.777 --> 00:25:05.574
I am down.

300
00:25:05.574 --> 00:25:08.870
Damn things aren't free Polaski!
Take the snipers from behind this time.

301
00:25:09.169 --> 00:25:09.968
Yes sir!

302
00:25:11.565 --> 00:25:12.763
Back online.

303
00:25:27.436 --> 00:25:28.533
Follow me.

304
00:25:28.533 --> 00:25:31.629
Keep an eye on Bravo Company.
We will kick some ass sir!

305
00:25:32.028 --> 00:25:34.422
Agent Greer you're wasting
your time with these questions.

306
00:25:35.321 --> 00:25:36.873
Why on earth would
the Defense Department...

307
00:25:36.873 --> 00:25:39.813
want to develop a weapon that
could wipe out our own troops?

308
00:25:39.813 --> 00:25:41.809
So no such weapon exists.

309
00:25:42.109 --> 00:25:44.006
If it did, I would know about it.

310
00:25:44.504 --> 00:25:46.102
And the soldier that we saw?

311
00:25:46.102 --> 00:25:49.296
We routinely remove motherboards
and optics for analysis.

312
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.350
Excuse me...

313
00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:54.187
we are in the middle
of a peacekeeping operation.

314
00:26:01.473 --> 00:26:02.639
Check your screen.

315
00:26:02.864 --> 00:26:04.669
What?
Myles Strickland.

316
00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:05.467
Who?

317
00:26:05.467 --> 00:26:07.861
Myles Strickland, meat bag...

318
00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.338
I did a run on criminal records,

319
00:26:09.363 --> 00:26:12.376
for Moto Guzzi drivers in black Arai
helmets and guess what I found?

320
00:26:12.852 --> 00:26:14.550
He's already in the system.

321
00:26:14.949 --> 00:26:17.944
He was arrested a month ago for
multiple counts of armed robbery.

322
00:26:18.742 --> 00:26:20.339
And what's really weird about this...

323
00:26:21.038 --> 00:26:23.435
after he was busted, they let him off.

324
00:26:24.032 --> 00:26:25.829
Someone on the inside's
protecting him.

325
00:26:26.228 --> 00:26:28.125
But I put out an APB anyway.

326
00:26:43.796 --> 00:26:45.493
Visual Match.

327
00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:00.565
Recognition search caught your dready.
Where?

328
00:27:00.565 --> 00:27:02.762
Dorchester, Gore Park and Adams.

329
00:27:02.762 --> 00:27:04.558
Not far from the reservation.

330
00:27:04.858 --> 00:27:06.955
Boston PD is on its way.

331
00:27:07.554 --> 00:27:09.150
Stay here and keep tabs on him.

332
00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:10.848
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

333
00:27:11.147 --> 00:27:12.245
Dorchester.

334
00:27:13.642 --> 00:27:15.139
It wasn't too difficult.

335
00:27:15.139 --> 00:27:17.278
I put his face in the system and, Bingo!

336
00:27:17.303 --> 00:27:18.558
We found him in an alley.

337
00:27:19.032 --> 00:27:21.228
K33 over there brought it to my attention.

338
00:27:21.528 --> 00:27:22.726
Thanks Jerry.

339
00:27:24.123 --> 00:27:25.999
He's one of our best watchers.

340
00:27:25.999 --> 00:27:27.417
He's semi-retired.

341
00:27:27.417 --> 00:27:29.814
So he gets to work out of
his beach house in Maine.

342
00:27:30.212 --> 00:27:32.999
Pretty sweet huh?
Yeah, it's a nice set-up you have here.

343
00:27:32.999 --> 00:27:35.303
Yeah, we can access every
Surrie on the grid here.

344
00:27:36.301 --> 00:27:37.598
Touch of a button.

345
00:27:38.097 --> 00:27:39.895
I can tap into anyone's feed.

346
00:27:40.594 --> 00:27:42.489
It's kind of like being inside God's head.

347
00:27:44.287 --> 00:27:46.777
Ohh, boy, I felt that one coming.

348
00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.078
Bobby Saunders, by the way.

349
00:27:50.674 --> 00:27:51.972
Jennifer Peters.

350
00:27:52.571 --> 00:27:53.345
Yeah.

351
00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:54.891
Yeah, you are, aren't you?

352
00:27:56.264 --> 00:27:57.861
Can I ask you a question?

353
00:27:58.761 --> 00:27:59.858
Why no surrogate?

354
00:28:00.357 --> 00:28:01.256
Me?

355
00:28:02.254 --> 00:28:03.951
They have been trying
to puppet me for years.

356
00:28:05.048 --> 00:28:07.944
But they ain't built a machine
that can handle this big puppy yet.

357
00:28:08.744 --> 00:28:09.841
Excuse me a second...

358
00:28:11.536 --> 00:28:13.234
We have an assault and
battery in progress.

359
00:28:13.234 --> 00:28:15.430
I need warrants to shut
them down immediately.

360
00:28:16.029 --> 00:28:18.525
Charlie 463 niner.

361
00:28:18.525 --> 00:28:20.920
Sierra 7855.

362
00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:24.999
Let's see if they have
a security camera in the hotel.

363
00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:27.999
Excellent, there is one.

364
00:28:30.203 --> 00:28:31.400
Warrant received.

365
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.797
Agent Peters.

366
00:28:34.096 --> 00:28:35.294
Watch this.

367
00:28:39.285 --> 00:28:41.650
Since when have you been
able to cut off operators?

368
00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:44.078
It's brand new software.
I call it buffering.

369
00:28:44.478 --> 00:28:46.574
Let's me disconnect anyone
from their surrogate.

370
00:28:46.674 --> 00:28:48.071
That can't be legal?

371
00:28:48.571 --> 00:28:49.968
It's a Grey area.

372
00:28:49.968 --> 00:28:51.564
They don't ask, we don't tell.

373
00:28:53.062 --> 00:28:54.159
It's pretty cool, huh?

374
00:28:54.358 --> 00:28:55.457
Come on.

375
00:28:56.455 --> 00:28:58.351
Relax, we are the good guys.

376
00:29:13.063 --> 00:29:14.239
Latest hit on the bike,

377
00:29:14.263 --> 00:29:18.029
turning east on South Hampton
half a mile from the Res.

378
00:29:18.029 --> 00:29:20.457
Greer be careful, you're heading
straight towards Dread territory.

379
00:29:20.457 --> 00:29:22.437
We don't have jurisdiction to fly over there.

380
00:29:22.437 --> 00:29:24.135
<i>It's restricted air space.</i>

381
00:29:25.251 --> 00:29:26.528
<i>Greer are you there?</i>

382
00:30:25.857 --> 00:30:29.999
Stop right there! Freeze!
He's got a gun!

383
00:30:34.951 --> 00:30:36.248
What was that?

384
00:30:40.237 --> 00:30:41.533
Bank left! Bank left!

385
00:31:07.031 --> 00:31:08.031
Hey!

386
00:32:19.181 --> 00:32:20.878
Fire! Fire!

387
00:32:27.645 --> 00:32:28.976
It's a surrogate!

388
00:32:42.293 --> 00:32:43.453
It's a machine!

389
00:34:14.682 --> 00:34:15.968
I ain't done nothing.

390
00:34:16.193 --> 00:34:17.400
I ain't done nothing.

391
00:34:19.072 --> 00:34:20.368
Give me the bag.

392
00:34:22.263 --> 00:34:23.360
Throw it over here.

393
00:34:25.156 --> 00:34:26.752
Throw it over here, now!

394
00:34:55.377 --> 00:34:57.073
You're an abomination.

395
00:34:57.572 --> 00:34:58.669
Oh god.

396
00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:27.441
Maggie.

397
00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.337
Maggie!

398
00:35:32.538 --> 00:35:35.037
Lionel Canter is on the phone. He's
called for Greer a half dozen times.

399
00:35:35.037 --> 00:35:36.737
I can't deal with this right now.

400
00:35:36.737 --> 00:35:39.335
He's pretty upset.
Just tell him someone will call him back.

401
00:35:39.335 --> 00:35:40.135
Peters!

402
00:35:40.736 --> 00:35:42.535
You got to believe me
I tried to stop him.

403
00:35:42.535 --> 00:35:44.734
Well, you didn't try hard enough.
You're done for the day.

404
00:35:44.734 --> 00:35:45.835
Clock out.

405
00:36:17.074 --> 00:36:20.202
Oh, you're kidding. Turquoise?

406
00:36:20.202 --> 00:36:23.999
I wouldn't carry a purse that color,
much less a whole new suit. Yeah.

407
00:36:25.516 --> 00:36:26.778
Oh, my God.

408
00:36:28.919 --> 00:36:29.517
Tom?

409
00:36:31.717 --> 00:36:32.617
Oh, my God!

410
00:36:32.916 --> 00:36:34.216
Bridge, call an ambulance!

411
00:36:50.309 --> 00:36:51.811
Myles Strickland is it?

412
00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:54.809
Why are you...

413
00:37:02.906 --> 00:37:04.106
What's going on?

414
00:37:04.106 --> 00:37:05.206
Who was it?

415
00:37:05.805 --> 00:37:07.304
Who gave you the weapon?

416
00:37:07.905 --> 00:37:09.304
And paid you to use it?

417
00:37:10.704 --> 00:37:11.803
I don't know!

418
00:37:11.803 --> 00:37:13.502
Myles you can't lie to me.

419
00:37:14.002 --> 00:37:15.100
I am not lying.

420
00:37:15.301 --> 00:37:16.902
I swear to God sir, I am not lying.

421
00:37:17.699 --> 00:37:18.999
He never told me his name.

422
00:37:19.299 --> 00:37:21.000
We talked on disposable cell phones.

423
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.499
I never saw his face.

424
00:37:23.098 --> 00:37:25.998
I couldn't tell you who he
was if my life depended on it!

425
00:37:29.297 --> 00:37:31.750
<i>A Police chase through

00:38:09.282 --> 00:38:10.181
Hi.

438
00:38:12.181 --> 00:38:12.982
Hey.

439
00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:15.979
How is the headache?

440
00:38:16.779 --> 00:38:17.980
Still there.

441
00:38:20.278 --> 00:38:22.278
Thanks for being here.
Of course.

442
00:38:22.278 --> 00:38:25.277
<i>Imagine a World where

00:38:43.869 --> 00:38:46.969
Knock Knock. Hey.
Andy. Hi.

449
00:38:47.768 --> 00:38:48.767
Oh my gosh.

450
00:38:49.267 --> 00:38:51.168
We haven't seen you forever.
I know.

451
00:38:51.168 --> 00:38:52.867
I should let you guys talk.

452
00:38:52.867 --> 00:38:55.265
Will you be okay?
I will be fine.

453
00:38:56.965 --> 00:38:58.065
I will see you tomorrow morning.

454
00:38:59.163 --> 00:39:00.063
Bye.

455
00:39:00.463 --> 00:39:01.164
Bye.

456
00:39:06.762 --> 00:39:07.761
How bad?

457
00:39:08.261 --> 00:39:10.361
The doctor said you are lucky to be alive.

458
00:39:10.961 --> 00:39:12.459
Good thing you unplugged.

459
00:39:14.259 --> 00:39:15.758
You got to go get him.

460
00:39:16.257 --> 00:39:17.999
Strickland's got that weapon.

461
00:39:18.357 --> 00:39:19.600
You just get a court order, and you...

462
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.356
There won't be any court orders,
you have been suspended.

463
00:39:22.955 --> 00:39:23.755
For what?

464
00:39:23.755 --> 00:39:26.034
Tom, you have violated our treaty
with the Dreads.

465
00:39:26.034 --> 00:39:27.234
Forget the Treaty!

466
00:39:27.555 --> 00:39:28.653
He killed 5 cops!

467
00:39:28.653 --> 00:39:31.700
Look, I am gonna take care of
this case myself personally. Alright?

468
00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:34.630
Now, I am afraid the bureau
won't be able to supply

469
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:37.750
you with a new surrogate until
after the official inquiry.

470
00:39:37.951 --> 00:39:39.649
The same goes for your
gun and your badge.

471
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:41.950
Don't think about this now.

472
00:39:48.847 --> 00:39:50.745
He killed 5 cops Andy.

473
00:39:54.645 --> 00:39:56.343
Take some time to heal.

474
00:40:29.331 --> 00:40:30.032
Hey.

475
00:40:30.832 --> 00:40:32.532
Hey.
Sorry I am late.

476
00:40:32.532 --> 00:40:33.531
That's ok.

477
00:40:36.129 --> 00:40:37.929
You look a lot like your synth.

478
00:40:38.529 --> 00:40:39.229
Yeah.

479
00:40:40.027 --> 00:40:40.828
Should we go?

480
00:40:47.525 --> 00:40:50.626
How long has it been since you have
been out without a Surrie?

481
00:40:51.323 --> 00:40:52.722
I can't even remember.

482
00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.821
I can't believe they didn't give
you something for the anxiety.

483
00:41:15.015 --> 00:41:15.816
Greer?

484
00:41:16.315 --> 00:41:18.533
Look, this isn't gonna work.

485
00:41:18.758 --> 00:41:20.475
I am fine.
I have an idea.

486
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.705
Come on. This is a really bad idea.

487
00:41:45.705 --> 00:41:48.703
It's gonna be alright. I am sure
we will find you something decent.

488
00:41:56.902 --> 00:41:59.799
Now, we're gonna have you
back on your feet in a sec.

489
00:42:01.799 --> 00:42:02.999
Sync looks good.

490
00:42:03.298 --> 00:42:04.697
It's responding well to signal, right?

491
00:42:06.897 --> 00:42:07.998
It feels numb.

492
00:42:08.296 --> 00:42:09.596
It's only a base model.

493
00:42:10.096 --> 00:42:11.196
It comes with vision and hearing.

494
00:42:11.196 --> 00:42:13.400
If you want other senses they're extra.

495
00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:17.450
Of course if you like seeing your own face
when you look in the mirror, no problem.

496
00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:19.999
We will just scan your head,
cast the thermo-plastic

497
00:42:19.999 --> 00:42:21.899
and you're good to go in less than an hour.

498
00:42:21.899 --> 00:42:23.591
Hey, no charge on the improvements.

499
00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:26.091
I am sure you wouldn't mind
taking yourself back

500
00:42:26.091 --> 00:42:28.980
5, 10 years, huh?
What do you think of that?

501
00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:30.890
I think we're done here.

502
00:42:36.986 --> 00:42:37.786
Greer.

503
00:42:44.884 --> 00:42:45.784
Tom.

504
00:42:46.683 --> 00:42:47.483
Tom.

505
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.179
Tom, Come on. you can't come out
here by yourself. It's not safe.

506
00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:52.180
Come on.
I am fine.

507
00:42:52.204 --> 00:42:54.381
Let me take you home.
I am not going home.

508
00:42:54.781 --> 00:42:57.479
Tom. You got to forget the case.

509
00:42:57.479 --> 00:43:00.079
Because Stone is going
to run things his way,

510
00:43:00.479 --> 00:43:02.777
and as far as we're concerned,
it's over.

511
00:43:02.778 --> 00:43:05.575
It's not over until we
get that weapon back.

512
00:43:07.775 --> 00:43:09.275
Then you got to let me help you.

513
00:43:11.874 --> 00:43:13.774
They're not going to let you in.

514
00:43:13.974 --> 00:43:15.873
Take care of yourself Peters.

515
00:44:04.354 --> 00:44:07.254
Death came for Myles Strickland,

516
00:44:08.553 --> 00:44:11.153
as death comes to all men.

517
00:44:12.352 --> 00:44:13.551
But for Myles,

518
00:44:14.751 --> 00:44:16.250
it's not an ending.

519
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:19.450
It's a new beginning.

520
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:24.999
When you sacrifice your
own personal desires,

521
00:44:24.999 --> 00:44:28.345
for a greater cause, a greater good.

522
00:44:29.947 --> 00:44:31.345
You never die.

523
00:44:32.645 --> 00:44:34.244
You never disappear.

524
00:44:35.445 --> 00:44:37.942
That is what it means to be human.

525
00:44:39.642 --> 00:44:41.242
There is no alternative

526
00:44:41.842 --> 00:44:44.639
You can try to escape by
living through a puppet,

527
00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:47.040
through a machine.

528
00:44:47.739 --> 00:44:52.238
But deep down inside,
you know you're living a lie.

529
00:44:54.137 --> 00:44:56.336
Here, inside these walls,

530
00:44:56.636 --> 00:44:58.437
we understand the truth.

531
00:45:01.765 --> 00:45:02.485
Sorry.

532
00:45:04.933 --> 00:45:08.732
We sacrifice many modern
pleasures and conveniences,

533
00:45:08.732 --> 00:45:11.299
to feel truly connected.

534
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:13.430
Not with machines.

535
00:45:16.028 --> 00:45:17.430
But with ourselves.

536
00:45:22.427 --> 00:45:24.526
This is the human condition.

537
00:45:24.727 --> 00:45:26.826
This is what gives life meaning.

538
00:45:27.825 --> 00:45:29.025
My friends.

539
00:45:29.124 --> 00:45:33.024
Soon the day will come
when surrogacy must end.

540
00:45:33.523 --> 00:45:36.100
That day, I promise you,

541
00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:37.722
is close at hand.

542
00:45:38.121 --> 00:45:39.150
The day...

543
00:45:40.175 --> 00:45:42.045
we get a second chance.

544
00:46:11.110 --> 00:46:12.209
Excuse me.

545
00:46:12.209 --> 00:46:13.702
Excuse me, fellows.

546
00:46:14.327 --> 00:46:15.933
Can I help you?
Yeah.

547
00:46:16.008 --> 00:46:18.007
I would like to speak to
The Prophet for a minute.

548
00:46:18.007 --> 00:46:19.807
You and everybody else but, no.

549
00:46:20.107 --> 00:46:21.906
What are you, some kind of cop
or something?

550
00:46:22.006 --> 00:46:23.407
You got no jurisdiction here.

551
00:46:23.407 --> 00:46:25.904
Can I talk to you about
Myles Strickland please?

552
00:46:30.701 --> 00:46:31.702
Enough.

553
00:46:35.301 --> 00:46:37.999
It's different when
you actually feel the pain,

554
00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:39.601
Isn't it?

555
00:46:41.598 --> 00:46:43.198
What happened to Strickland?

556
00:46:45.297 --> 00:46:46.996
Was he a friend of yours?

557
00:46:47.496 --> 00:46:48.497
He had a weapon.

558
00:46:48.996 --> 00:46:50.696
A very dangerous weapon.

559
00:46:52.095 --> 00:46:55.294
My people will do anything
to get this back.

560
00:46:58.794 --> 00:47:02.299
Well if I happen to come
across such a weapon...

561
00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:06.199
I promise to have it delivered
to your door.

562
00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:09.488
Show him to the gates.

563
00:47:11.289 --> 00:47:12.288
Gently.

564
00:47:55.472 --> 00:47:56.940
Agent Greer.

565
00:47:57.365 --> 00:47:59.323
May I offer you a ride?

566
00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:04.970
You will have to excuse my appearance.

567
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:07.967
It's not safe for me to use my usual surrogates.

568
00:48:09.268 --> 00:48:10.467
Dr. Canter.

569
00:48:10.467 --> 00:48:12.865
This is one of VSI's newer models.

570
00:48:13.565 --> 00:48:14.966
How long have you been following me?

571
00:48:14.966 --> 00:48:18.464
Long enough to know you're getting
nowhere solving my son's murder.

572
00:48:21.562 --> 00:48:23.562
You lost a child Agent Greer?

573
00:48:24.862 --> 00:48:25.861
How?

574
00:48:29.159 --> 00:48:30.660
Car accident.

575
00:48:35.758 --> 00:48:37.358
It was just an accident.

576
00:48:39.056 --> 00:48:40.355
I am sorry.

577
00:48:45.054 --> 00:48:48.654
I can think of no worse tragedy
than a parent outliving a child.

578
00:48:53.752 --> 00:48:55.152
All I can tell you...

579
00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:58.550
is that the man who killed
your son is dead.

580
00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:00.749
His name was Myles Strickland.

581
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:02.448
Lived on the Res.

582
00:49:04.447 --> 00:49:06.348
He was killed by his own people.

583
00:49:06.648 --> 00:49:07.947
And that's it?

584
00:49:08.146 --> 00:49:09.446
Case solved?

585
00:49:10.447 --> 00:49:12.844
One man didn't act on his own.

586
00:49:13.943 --> 00:49:15.743
Whatever killed my son,

587
00:49:15.844 --> 00:49:19.100
was an extraordinarily
sophisticated technology.

588
00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.841
Far beyond the capability of the Dreads.

589
00:49:21.941 --> 00:49:25.540
We're talking about
a billion-dollar weapons project.

590
00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:27.939
Who do you know spends
money like that?

591
00:49:38.635 --> 00:49:41.199
Focus on the weapon,
where it came from.

592
00:49:58.606 --> 00:49:59.903
Do me.

593
00:50:06.086 --> 00:50:07.883
That was intense.

594
00:50:18.157 --> 00:50:19.335
Hey Maggie?

595
00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:21.349
No, thank you.

596
00:50:21.449 --> 00:50:23.099
Come on. It will take the edge off.

597
00:50:32.221 --> 00:50:34.017
Tom?
Honey?

598
00:50:38.405 --> 00:50:40.301
I thought you were still in the hospital?

599
00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:41.198
Yeah...

600
00:50:42.296 --> 00:50:43.393
I can see that.

601
00:50:43.691 --> 00:50:44.889
What happened to you?

602
00:50:46.884 --> 00:50:49.977
Tom, I don't want you going out
without your Surrie ever again.

603
00:50:49.977 --> 00:50:50.924
Tom?

604
00:50:52.049 --> 00:50:53.966
You look very nice, sexy.

605
00:50:53.966 --> 00:50:56.881
Ok. Don't start. I am sorry, those
guys they're friends of Bridget's.

606
00:50:56.881 --> 00:50:59.551
She brought them over,
she wanted to go to this party.

607
00:50:59.551 --> 00:51:01.148
I didn't even want to go.

608
00:51:01.148 --> 00:51:02.844
How long have you been jacking?

609
00:51:03.144 --> 00:51:04.740
I don't.

610
00:51:05.835 --> 00:51:07.131
I don't do it Tom.

611
00:51:07.131 --> 00:51:09.827
And what does it matter if I did?
Why are you being like this?

612
00:51:09.927 --> 00:51:11.899
Ok. Go have a good time, Maggie.

613
00:51:39.963 --> 00:51:40.987
Tom!

614
00:51:48.328 --> 00:51:49.724
Tom stop it!

615
00:52:11.771 --> 00:52:12.767
Tom?

616
00:52:13.664 --> 00:52:14.960
Tom, what was that?

617
00:52:16.755 --> 00:52:18.999
What?
What do you want from me?

618
00:52:26.042 --> 00:52:27.898
I want you.

619
00:52:28.723 --> 00:52:30.367
I want my wife.

620
00:52:31.619 --> 00:52:33.114
I am your wife.

621
00:52:33.114 --> 00:52:34.609
And you won't see it.

622
00:52:35.308 --> 00:52:36.606
You're not her.

623
00:52:37.603 --> 00:52:38.900
No, you're not.

624
00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:41.264
Not.

625
00:52:42.489 --> 00:52:44.310
Not, this...

626
00:52:44.985 --> 00:52:46.977
This... thing.

627
00:52:49.933 --> 00:52:50.967
This...

628
00:52:51.867 --> 00:52:53.563
I just want you.

629
00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:57.353
This...
I want the woman that's in that room.

630
00:52:57.853 --> 00:52:58.950
My wife.

631
00:53:03.239 --> 00:53:04.635
Things have changed, Tom.

632
00:53:04.734 --> 00:53:07.129
You're... No, you have changed.
You're just scared.

633
00:53:07.229 --> 00:53:09.321
You're just scared.
We could go talk to somebody...

634
00:53:09.621 --> 00:53:10.569
Maggie.

635
00:53:11.794 --> 00:53:13.638
Maggie, don't walk away from me.

636
00:54:14.302 --> 00:54:16.903
Agent Greer?
Is that... Is that you?

637
00:54:17.603 --> 00:54:18.301
Yeah.

638
00:54:19.101 --> 00:54:22.602
You look... You look terrible.
Thanks. you too.

639
00:55:04.901 --> 00:55:07.436
<i>The identity chip's completely fried.</i>

640
00:55:07.836 --> 00:55:09.339
<i>What do you got on the girl?</i>

641
00:55:09.839 --> 00:55:12.034
<i>Come on. Let's go talk to her op...</i>

642
00:55:13.543 --> 00:55:15.670
<i>We can access every surrie on the grid.</i>

643
00:55:16.046 --> 00:55:19.379
<i>Touch of a button,
I can tap into anyone's feed.</i>

644
00:55:37.091 --> 00:55:39.491
<i>Transfer to remote operator.</i>

645
00:55:58.688 --> 00:55:59.687
I wish I could help.

646
00:56:00.088 --> 00:56:01.488
This thing killed 5 cops.

647
00:56:01.988 --> 00:56:04.686
One of my men.
It almost put me in the ground.

648
00:56:05.287 --> 00:56:06.556
I know it's a weapon.

649
00:56:06.781 --> 00:56:08.188
I want to know what kind.

650
00:56:08.388 --> 00:56:10.716
You're asking me to compromise
highly classified information.

651
00:56:10.716 --> 00:56:12.156
I know where it is.

652
00:56:12.386 --> 00:56:13.685
Where is it?

653
00:56:14.387 --> 00:56:15.586
Right.

654
00:56:23.085 --> 00:56:24.385
It's called an OD.

655
00:56:25.285 --> 00:56:26.784
Overload Device.

656
00:56:28.383 --> 00:56:31.184
The idea was to end
the battle with one shot.

657
00:56:32.583 --> 00:56:34.881
You beam a software virus
straight to the CPU.

658
00:56:35.383 --> 00:56:37.283
Disables the Surries instantly.

659
00:56:37.883 --> 00:56:41.183
We didn't know the virus
would defeat the built-in fail-safes.

660
00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:43.681
Kill the operators.

661
00:56:43.981 --> 00:56:45.280
Who makes it?

662
00:56:47.281 --> 00:56:48.382
VSI.

663
00:56:50.479 --> 00:56:51.580
After the test,

664
00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:54.680
the project was scrapped.

665
00:56:55.879 --> 00:56:57.280
Every unit was destroyed.

666
00:56:57.881 --> 00:56:59.279
Except for this one, right?

667
00:57:02.178 --> 00:57:03.080
Where is it?

668
00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:06.078
Right now, it's in the hands
of the Human Coalition.

669
00:57:06.078 --> 00:57:07.778
How long have they had it?
A day...

670
00:57:07.979 --> 00:57:09.179
Maybe two.

671
00:57:10.878 --> 00:57:12.280
This is out of your hands.

672
00:57:12.877 --> 00:57:14.577
Military will handle this.

673
00:57:22.377 --> 00:57:23.889
You called for us?

674
00:57:23.914 --> 00:57:27.570
Take this to the federal
building downtown.

675
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:29.475
A woman will meet you there.

676
00:57:29.875 --> 00:57:31.776
Agent Jennifer Peters.

677
00:57:32.375 --> 00:57:34.087
You're to give it to her,

678
00:57:34.512 --> 00:57:35.798
and her alone.

679
00:57:43.573 --> 00:57:44.472
Peters.

680
00:57:45.473 --> 00:57:46.474
What are you doing?

681
00:57:47.272 --> 00:57:49.373
Just a background check on VSI.

682
00:57:49.873 --> 00:57:51.072
Structural stuff.

683
00:57:51.072 --> 00:57:53.271
Those are internal financial records.

684
00:57:53.871 --> 00:57:55.372
Talk to Jenkins in corporate.

685
00:57:56.271 --> 00:57:57.070
6th Floor.

686
00:58:02.272 --> 00:58:03.871
Don't forget the cheekbones.

687
00:58:06.069 --> 00:58:07.970
Okay, honey.
Face off.

688
00:58:20.369 --> 00:58:21.467
Maggs.

689
00:58:28.867 --> 00:58:29.966
Hi Tom.

690
00:58:32.666 --> 00:58:33.616
Those...

691
00:58:34.441 --> 00:58:35.991
Smile muscles need to set.

692
00:58:38.466 --> 00:58:40.264
Hey.
Hi.

693
00:58:41.565 --> 00:58:42.964
Sorry about last night.

694
00:58:44.064 --> 00:58:45.364
I am at work Tom.

695
00:58:45.463 --> 00:58:47.466
I didn't come here to argue.
Good.

696
00:58:52.063 --> 00:58:54.265
See, I feel like I am going crazy.

697
00:58:57.763 --> 00:58:59.462
It's, I just...

698
00:59:01.463 --> 00:59:02.762
I love you.

699
00:59:03.862 --> 00:59:06.562
I love the smart, beautiful,

700
00:59:07.461 --> 00:59:09.261
Intelligent, funny,

701
00:59:10.561 --> 00:59:11.660
woman and...

702
00:59:13.958 --> 00:59:15.160
I can't sleep.

703
00:59:16.759 --> 00:59:19.259
And when I do,
I have these dreams that are...

704
00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:27.300
And I can't stop thinking about him.

705
00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:28.300
Tom.

706
00:59:29.189 --> 00:59:30.189
Don't.

707
00:59:30.458 --> 00:59:32.358
Don't you ever think about him?

708
00:59:33.057 --> 00:59:34.957
Of course I think about him, Tom.

709
00:59:34.957 --> 00:59:36.456
You say you don't sleep?

710
00:59:36.658 --> 00:59:38.056
You say you have nightmares?

711
00:59:38.056 --> 00:59:41.655
Well, that girl who you say is funny
and charming and witty...

712
00:59:41.957 --> 00:59:44.556
and has a great smile,
she doesn't smile anymore.

713
00:59:45.156 --> 00:59:46.256
I don't believe that.

714
00:59:46.554 --> 00:59:49.057
The only reason I can get up in the
morning and get out of the house

715
00:59:49.057 --> 00:59:50.955
Is because this is who I am now.

716
00:59:51.254 --> 00:59:52.755
But that's OK, Maggie...
No, no.

717
00:59:53.154 --> 00:59:54.055
No.
Maggie.

718
00:59:54.079 --> 00:59:55.252
No!

719
00:59:55.253 --> 00:59:56.554
Maggie wait.

720
01:00:55.846 --> 01:00:58.846
<i>Brothers and sisters, gather
close and prepare yourselves.</i>

721
01:00:59.455 --> 01:01:04.415
<i>The day of the resurrection is upon us.
Today we make history.</i>

722
01:01:04.415 --> 01:01:07.985
<i>Today we launch the revolution!</i>
Gotta go now!

723
01:01:13.042 --> 01:01:14.842
You all know what we're looking for.

724
01:01:15.043 --> 01:01:18.742
Remember, do not fire
unless absolutely necessary.

725
01:01:20.542 --> 01:01:22.041
The biological, too.

726
01:01:24.113 --> 01:01:25.710
<i>Over here, over here.</i>

727
01:01:29.118 --> 01:01:30.999
Over there!
Take cover!

728
01:01:38.439 --> 01:01:41.439
Cease fire!
Hands behind your head. Cease fire.

729
01:01:54.238 --> 01:01:55.237
My God.

730
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.933
I couldn't figure out why
the cops let Strickland off.

731
01:02:22.933 --> 01:02:25.734
So, I started going
through the payroll records.

732
01:02:26.833 --> 01:02:28.032
You won't believe this.

733
01:02:28.032 --> 01:02:30.399
For the past 16 months...
Working for us.

734
01:02:30.999 --> 01:02:31.933
That's right.

735
01:02:32.730 --> 01:02:34.731
Which means Stone's got to be dirty.

736
01:02:35.432 --> 01:02:38.032
Looks like he hired Strickland to kill Canter.

737
01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.885
Hey, Tom. Thought you were on leave.

738
01:02:46.885 --> 01:02:48.829
Well, yeah, I am.

739
01:02:48.829 --> 01:02:53.063
Actually, I am just suspended pending,
further investigation.

740
01:02:53.063 --> 01:02:56.970
But I am just clearing my desk out.
You should be home, recuperating.

741
01:02:56.970 --> 01:02:59.907
OK? Not walking around here
in the flesh.

742
01:02:59.907 --> 01:03:02.775
I was home. Then I came here
to clean out my desk.

743
01:03:02.775 --> 01:03:05.869
And you know before the
medication kicks in, hopefully,

744
01:03:06.194 --> 01:03:07.433
I can find a box...

745
01:03:07.457 --> 01:03:08.457
and...

746
01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:13.720
Victor Welsh wanted me to say hello.

747
01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.883
I am sorry?
Victor Welsh, VSI.

748
01:03:16.884 --> 01:03:19.393
The Good-looking kid?
Very excited you're coming over there.

749
01:03:19.393 --> 01:03:22.328
Finally moving into the private sector.
You must be excited?

750
01:03:22.828 --> 01:03:25.425
Why don't you come in my office.
You're not looking too sharp.

751
01:03:25.425 --> 01:03:27.868
Yeah, I got a minute, you know.

752
01:03:27.868 --> 01:03:31.237
It's a good move for you.
It's a really good group over there.

753
01:03:31.237 --> 01:03:33.834
Smart, talented,

754
01:03:33.834 --> 01:03:35.461
great legal department.

755
01:03:35.986 --> 01:03:38.461
It's a great working environment.

756
01:03:39.382 --> 01:03:42.879
And you got to be happy with those
first-year stock options?

757
01:03:43.079 --> 01:03:45.212
What are you talking about?

758
01:03:45.788 --> 01:03:46.879
Miles Strickland.

759
01:03:47.304 --> 01:03:48.608
The guy I was chasing.

760
01:03:49.358 --> 01:03:51.285
The guy you hired to kill Canter.

761
01:03:51.310 --> 01:03:52.816
Tom, you got it all wrong.

762
01:03:52.816 --> 01:03:54.307
You gave him the weapon.

763
01:03:54.432 --> 01:03:55.778
VSI makes them.

764
01:03:56.079 --> 01:03:57.530
They give one to you,

765
01:03:57.530 --> 01:03:59.599
you give it to Strickland
so he can go out and kill Canter.

766
01:03:59.599 --> 01:04:02.035
The only problem is,
he killed his son by mistake.

767
01:04:02.235 --> 01:04:03.871
Something is wrong with you.

768
01:04:04.096 --> 01:04:05.555
Why are you doing this?

769
01:04:06.275 --> 01:04:08.306
Money? Is that what it is?

770
01:04:08.744 --> 01:04:10.075
You need help.

771
01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:06.792
<i>This is Stone.</i>

772
01:05:06.792 --> 01:05:09.650
That son of a bitch
Greer disabled my unit!

773
01:05:09.675 --> 01:05:10.627
Stop him!

774
01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:15.375
Go! Go!

775
01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:30.589
Jesus. No wonder VSI wants Canter dead.

776
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:32.594
He's in bed with The Prophet.

777
01:05:32.594 --> 01:05:35.028
He's funding the anti-surrogacy movement.

778
01:05:35.028 --> 01:05:36.691
He's given them millions.

779
01:05:36.691 --> 01:05:40.998
Crazy bastard invents surrogates then
does everything he can to destroy them.

780
01:05:40.998 --> 01:05:44.700
It doesn't connect Stone to the murder.
We need to link him to the weapon.

781
01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:49.006
He needed codes to use it.
I want you to look for access codes.

782
01:05:49.845 --> 01:05:52.541
We get the codes, we nail Stone.

783
01:06:01.891 --> 01:06:04.826
Good job, Agent Greer. Thank you.

784
01:06:04.826 --> 01:06:07.260
This is Agent Peters. I found Greer.

785
01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:09.696
He's been in an accident
at Market and Hanover.

786
01:08:09.418 --> 01:08:11.943
FBI!
Get out of the car.

787
01:08:13.155 --> 01:08:15.783
He's gone.
Scan for an identity chip.

788
01:08:15.783 --> 01:08:17.884
He doesn't have one.
He's a meat bag.

789
01:08:17.884 --> 01:08:19.588
There's an exit in back!

790
01:08:48.958 --> 01:08:51.119
Hey! Where you going? Hey!

791
01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:56.988
Bobby, it's Greer.
I need a remote shutdown.

792
01:08:56.988 --> 01:09:01.532
<i>Agent Peters has been hijacked.
You have got to disconnect her.</i>

793
01:09:01.971 --> 01:09:03.905
<i>Bobby? Hello, Bobby?</i>

794
01:09:03.905 --> 01:09:07.500
Peters... have you gone insane?

795
01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:09.534
Why don't you put the gun down?

796
01:09:10.034 --> 01:09:11.329
<i>What are you trying to prove?</i>

797
01:09:11.454 --> 01:09:14.523
<i>She's tapping into the
entire surrie network!</i>

798
01:09:26.262 --> 01:09:29.390
Maggie, get off line right away,
as soon as you get this message.

799
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:31.189
Something's gonna happen
to the surrogates.

800
01:09:32.568 --> 01:09:33.762
She will only speak to you, sir.

801
01:09:33.762 --> 01:09:35.427
Why don't you just move in and
take her down?

802
01:09:36.472 --> 01:09:38.736
She has a human hostage.

803
01:09:38.736 --> 01:09:41.208
That slob Saunders!

804
01:09:52.221 --> 01:09:53.061
Peters?

805
01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:02.455
Peters, it's me, Andy Stone.

806
01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:04.757
That's far enough, Stone.

807
01:10:08.269 --> 01:10:10.332
I know who hired you to kill me.

808
01:10:11.507 --> 01:10:14.999
I hope my old partners
at VSI paid you well.

809
01:10:16.078 --> 01:10:18.512
Did you feel even a second of remorse

810
01:10:18.512 --> 01:10:21.141
when you found out
you'd murdered an innocent boy?

811
01:10:21.917 --> 01:10:23.111
Canter.

812
01:10:24.453 --> 01:10:25.818
I don't believe it.

813
01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:29.487
OK. How about you tell me something, doctor.

814
01:10:31.059 --> 01:10:33.595
What did you expect VSI to do?

815
01:10:33.695 --> 01:10:36.789
Just stand by while you tore down
everything they built?

816
01:10:37.132 --> 01:10:39.760
You left us no choice but to take you out.

817
01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:41.312
You create this technology,

818
01:10:41.337 --> 01:10:43.671
you change the world and
now you want to destroy it?

819
01:10:44.171 --> 01:10:45.222
So what?

820
01:10:46.347 --> 01:10:47.798
So you can take us backwards?

821
01:10:48.577 --> 01:10:50.340
So we can all live like dreads?

822
01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:56.281
So we can live like human beings.

823
01:10:58.520 --> 01:10:59.885
Really, doctor.

824
01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:02.783
You should learn how
to live with your regrets.

825
01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:06.051
Now, give me the gun.

826
01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:14.226
No!

827
01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:35.682
That's for my son.

828
01:11:48.737 --> 01:11:50.014
I need to see your boss.

829
01:11:50.339 --> 01:11:52.036
I need to see Dr. Canter right away.

830
01:11:52.036 --> 01:11:53.289
Oh, good. Listen to me.

831
01:11:53.414 --> 01:11:55.205
I got to see your boss, Dr. Canter.

832
01:11:56.005 --> 01:11:57.005
Hey!

833
01:11:58.847 --> 01:12:00.872
Don't! Oh, Jesus!

834
01:12:07.222 --> 01:12:09.087
<i>Device connected.</i>

835
01:12:14.029 --> 01:12:16.054

836
01:12:36.218 --> 01:12:38.584
<i>Warning. Commencing upload.</i>

837
01:14:19.988 --> 01:14:21.012
Hello, Tom.

838
01:14:25.194 --> 01:14:26.977
Nice to finally meet you.

839
01:14:27.402 --> 01:14:28.710
In the flesh.

840
01:14:35.804 --> 01:14:36.695
Now...

841
01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:39.191
lie on the floor face down.

842
01:14:41.143 --> 01:14:44.372
It's a little different when you have to
kill somebody with your own hands.

843
01:14:44.772 --> 01:14:46.409
When you have to squeeze the trigger.

844
01:14:46.410 --> 01:14:48.348
When you don't have a machine
to do your dirty work.

845
01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:51.543
Feel that?

846
01:14:52.521 --> 01:14:55.319
The accelerated pulse?
The heightened awareness?

847
01:14:55.624 --> 01:14:58.388
Savoring each breath as if it were your last?

848
01:14:58.388 --> 01:15:00.159
That's what you have been missing.

849
01:15:00.384 --> 01:15:02.286
It's what everybody's
been missing.

850
01:15:02.386 --> 01:15:03.728
So you kill millions of people.

851
01:15:03.728 --> 01:15:07.499
I changed the course of human history
when I invented surrogates.

852
01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:10.026
Now I am going to change it back.

853
01:15:10.151 --> 01:15:12.160
You can't change what's been done.

854
01:15:13.775 --> 01:15:15.868
You and I know that
better than most people.

855
01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:20.062
My son's death will not
have been in vain.

856
01:15:20.887 --> 01:15:22.573
Not if it heals mankind.

857
01:15:23.919 --> 01:15:25.712
Heals mankind?

858
01:15:26.012 --> 01:15:27.339
That's what you want to do?

859
01:15:27.364 --> 01:15:28.716
You want to kill everyone?

860
01:15:28.716 --> 01:15:30.440
And that's going to heal mankind?

861
01:15:30.465 --> 01:15:31.554
They're already dead.

862
01:15:31.555 --> 01:15:33.902
They died the minute they
plugged into those machines.

863
01:15:34.027 --> 01:15:35.484
This is not the solution!

864
01:15:35.485 --> 01:15:36.294
That's the way it is.

865
01:15:36.394 --> 01:15:38.392
That's not the way it is!
I had a vision.

866
01:15:38.592 --> 01:15:40.534
I was going to empower the powerless.

867
01:15:41.003 --> 01:15:44.370
To enable others like me to walk, to feel,

868
01:15:44.370 --> 01:15:46.237
to live a normal life.
Listen to me!

869
01:15:46.237 --> 01:15:48.706
They're going to call you a murderer!
That's what you're doing.

870
01:15:48.707 --> 01:15:50.837
Surrogacy is a perversion.

871
01:15:51.062 --> 01:15:52.375
It's an addiction.

872
01:15:52.379 --> 01:15:55.478
And you have to kill the addict
to kill the addiction.

01:16:01.413 --> 01:16:04.605

Jesus.

885
01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:54.889
It's trying to kill everyone.

886
01:16:56.044 --> 01:16:58.808
Listen, that thing has just uploaded
a virus into the system

887
01:16:58.808 --> 01:17:01.907
that's going to kill anyone
who's using a surrogate.

889
01:17:03.852 --> 01:17:06.514
Bobby, we need to unplug everyone. Now!

890
01:17:07.114 --> 01:17:08.484
Oh, shit.
Think!

891
01:17:14.363 --> 01:17:16.388
OK. Move over to the terminal to the left.

892
01:17:16.865 --> 01:17:19.060
Type in password red 253.

893
01:17:19.768 --> 01:17:22.566
We can't unplug it,
but maybe we can buffer the operators.

894
01:17:24.005 --> 01:17:26.131
Oh, God. OK, we got ten seconds.

895
01:17:29.911 --> 01:17:33.608
OK, look, there are three boxes.
Type in tango in the first,

896
01:17:33.608 --> 01:17:37.415
X-ray in the second,
772 in the third. Hit enter!

897
01:17:40.823 --> 01:17:42.754
Shit!
Hit enter! What happened?

898
01:17:42.754 --> 01:17:46.522
Ah, shit! Shift and enter.
Shift and enter.

899
01:17:54.603 --> 01:17:56.662
We just saved about a billion lives there.

900
01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:01.466
OK, now we got to keep the surrogates
from getting fried.

901
01:18:01.466 --> 01:18:04.809
Please go back to the first terminal,
hit the enter key.

902
01:18:04.809 --> 01:18:06.279
Hit the enter key, please!

903
01:18:08.183 --> 01:18:09.616
Good. Now press yes.

904
01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:18.550
So that's it? Everyone's safe?

905
01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:19.855
What?
All the people?

906
01:18:19.855 --> 01:18:22.693
Yes. Yes. Of course. Yes.
All the operators are safe.

907
01:18:22.693 --> 01:18:26.064
But if you don't press abort, all the
surries are going to be destroyed.

908
01:18:29.438 --> 01:18:32.029
We don't have a lot of time, man.
Hit yes.

909
01:18:32.808 --> 01:18:34.867
Hi. Hello. Hit yes, Greer.

910
01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:38.771
Greer, I am talking all the surrogates.

911
01:18:49.758 --> 01:18:51.055
Greer, what are you doing?

912
01:18:53.161 --> 01:18:56.255
Greer! For God sakes,
what are you waiting for?

913
01:18:56.255 --> 01:18:58.129
Press the freaking button, Tom!

914
01:18:58.934 --> 01:19:01.232
Freeze!
Show me your hands!

915
01:19:33.535 --> 01:19:34.968
<i>Transmit complete.</i>

916
01:21:47.335 --> 01:21:48.700
Excuse me.

917
01:23:19.494 --> 01:23:22.122
<i>Please bear with us as
we're still trying to piece together</i>

918
01:23:22.122 --> 01:23:24.154
<i>exactly what has occurred today.</i>

919
01:23:24.154 --> 01:23:27.930
<i>There has been a total systems failure
of the central surrogate grid</i>

920
01:23:27.930 --> 01:23:30.767
<i>in every major city
on the eastern seaboard,</i>

921
01:23:30.767 --> 01:23:32.773
<i>possibly in the entire United States.</i>

922
01:23:32.773 --> 01:23:35.489
<i>describing an identical
failure in those cities.</i>

923
01:23:35.514 --> 01:23:36.709
<i>This is unbelievable.</i>

924
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:39.043
<i>No reports
of human casualties.</i>

925
01:23:39.043 --> 01:23:41.776
<i>The damage appears limited
only to surrogate units.</i>

926
01:23:41.776 --> 01:23:43.750
<i>Thus far, no statements from VSI.</i>

927
01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:46.185
<i>They have not responded
to requests for information.</i>

928
01:23:46.185 --> 01:23:49.418
<i>Paris, London, Beijing,
all reporting the same thing.</i>

929
01:23:49.418 --> 01:23:54.793
<i>So, still no official word when or
if surrogate services can be restored.</i>

930
01:23:54.793 --> 01:23:59.562
<i>It appears, at least for now,
that we're on our own.</i>

931
01:24:02.448 --> 01:24:09.847
