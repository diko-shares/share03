<i>Unplug from your chairs,
get up and look in the mirror.</i>

00:00:39.675 --> 00:00:42.527
<i>What you see is
how God made you.</i>

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.724
<i>We're not meant to experience the
world through a machine.</i>

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.643
14 YEARS AGO

8
00:01:00.917 --> 00:01:04.125
<i>What you're telling me is....
a monkey is operating this arm</i>

9
00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:06.008
<i>with nothing but his thoughts?</i>

10
00:01:06.008 --> 00:01:07.426
<i>Absolutely.</i>

11
00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:12.895
<i>There are 100 sensors,</i>

12
00:01:12.895 --> 00:01:15.916
<i>each listening to a different
brain cell or neuron.</i>

13
00:01:19.183 --> 00:01:22.260
<i>Physicaly disabed people

14
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.847
<i>Fully synthetic bodies.</i>

15
00:01:24.847 --> 00:01:27.621
<i>It provides a tremendous amount
of hope for the future.</i>

16
00:01:28.183 --> 00:01:29.881
11 YEARS AGO

17
00:01:32.222 --> 00:01:34.774
<i>Because of the technology that
we have, at a time of war</i>

18
00:01:34.774 --> 00:01:36.877
<i>we're going to start seeing
this more and more.</i>

19
00:01:36.877 --> 00:01:40.995
<i>As manufacturing capacity expanded
for military and industrial use</i>

20
00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:43.829
<i>Surrogates became affordable
to the general public</i>

21
00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.322
<i>Causing a revolution in how we live.</i>

22
00:01:47.231 --> 00:01:50.635
<i>The ability to leave your home
without risk of disease or injury</i>

23
00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:54.742
<i>To have perfect looks without trips
to the gym or plastic surgery</i>

24
00:01:54.742 --> 00:01:57.718
<i>There is no question that at some point
they will be persons like anyone else</i>

25
00:01:57.718 --> 00:02:00.810
They will not be human, but that
they will be part of our community?

26
00:02:01.083 --> 00:02:02.582
There is no question
in my mind.

27
00:02:02.863 --> 00:02:05.204
<i>The decision
came down 5 to 4.</i>

28
00:02:05.567 --> 00:02:09.090
<i>That the Supreme Court ruled in favor
of the use of surrogates in daily life.</i>

29
00:02:13.822 --> 00:02:16.872
<i>Right now,
we are witnessing an event.</i>

30
00:02:16.872 --> 00:02:18.844
That is of
an evolutionary significance

31
00:02:18.844 --> 00:02:20.950
7 YEARS AGO

32
00:02:21.747 --> 00:02:24.908
<i>According to VSI, the industries
leading manufacturer,</i>

<i>over 98% of the world population</i>

34
00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:32.013
<i>uses a surrogate in all
facets of their daily life.</i>

35
00:02:34.743 --> 00:02:36.626
We're in the midst
of profound changes that....

36
00:02:36.626 --> 00:02:39.836
<i>....are things that were once
unimaginable have become inevitable.</i>

37
00:02:39.836 --> 00:02:42.172
<i>Since the global
embrace of surrogacy</i>

38
00:02:42.373 --> 00:02:44.472
<i>crime rates have dropped
to record lows</i>

39
00:02:44.972 --> 00:02:47.673
<i>We have witnessed and incredible
reduction in violent crime</i>

40
00:02:48.173 --> 00:02:50.472
communicable disease
and discrimination.

41
00:02:50.472 --> 00:02:53.273
<i>Problems that have plagued
societies for centuries</i>

42
00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:55.372
<i>solved almost overnight.</i>

43
00:02:55.372 --> 00:02:56.873
We are the creators.

44
00:02:57.173 --> 00:02:59.173
<i>We will be making them.</i>

45
00:02:59.173 --> 00:03:01.372
Do everything for us.
All in one machine.

46
00:03:01.372 --> 00:03:03.273
3 YEARS AGO

47
00:03:04.373 --> 00:03:07.173
<i>But there is a minority who
actively oppose Surrogates</i>

48
00:03:07.173 --> 00:03:09.273
<i>And are moving
to limit their use.</i>

49
00:03:11.573 --> 00:03:13.673
<i>Many people will see this</i>

50
00:03:13.673 --> 00:03:17.174
<i>as the invasion
of the inhuman.</i>

51
00:03:18.473 --> 00:03:21.374
<i>They have established reservations
or surrogacy free zones</i>

52
00:03:21.374 --> 00:03:23.673
<i>in major cities
around the country.</i>

53
00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:29.773
<i>They are led by Zaire Powell</i>

54
00:03:29.773 --> 00:03:31.774
<i>or as he is better known
to his followers</i>

55
00:03:31.774 --> 00:03:32.874
<i>The Prophet.</i>

56
00:03:32.874 --> 00:03:35.374
Those machines walking
around out there

57
00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:37.074
They're a lie.

58
00:03:40.974 --> 00:03:43.574
You have been sold a lie.

59
00:03:43.874 --> 00:03:45.574
PRESENT DAY

60
00:03:54.475 --> 00:03:56.475
<i>You're going to love Tosca.</i>

61
00:03:56.475 --> 00:03:59.575
-Alright, but don't tell me how it ends.
-The way they all end.

62
00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:01.775
Everyone dies.

63
00:04:03.675 --> 00:04:06.575
I am so glad you could
come back east for a visit.

64
00:04:06.975 --> 00:04:09.375
Well...
Anything for a break from exams.

65
00:04:10.175 --> 00:04:11.475
We're almost there.

66
00:04:11.975 --> 00:04:13.975
Listen...
Thanks for lending him to me.

67
00:04:14.475 --> 00:04:15.875
Have a wonderful time.

68
00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:18.076
I love you.

69
00:04:18.076 --> 00:04:19.875
I love you too Dad.

70
00:04:28.976 --> 00:04:30.176
You know Armando

71
00:04:30.475 --> 00:04:32.076
I am not really
in the mood for opera

72
00:04:33.476 --> 00:04:34.576
Four Point?

73
00:04:35.876 --> 00:04:37.276
You read my mind.

74
00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:27.580
Get lost meatbag.

75
00:07:13.781 --> 00:07:15.081
I am agent Peters.

76
00:07:15.781 --> 00:07:18.081
This is Agent Greer... FBI.

77
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:22.181
Yeah... some jackass on a motorcycle
wiped out a bunch of units

78
00:07:22.181 --> 00:07:23.782
So what do you need us for?

79
00:07:24.282 --> 00:07:26.781
Well I was going to file just
a vandalism report

80
00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:28.982
but it turns out this
unit's unregistered.

81
00:07:36.282 --> 00:07:38.282
Looks like it's going
to need new optics

82
00:07:38.982 --> 00:07:40.082
No shit

83
00:07:53.594 --> 00:07:55.693
The identity chip
is completely fried.

84
00:07:56.593 --> 00:07:57.694
What you got on the girl?

85
00:07:57.694 --> 00:08:01.193
Registered to a
Cameron McAllister out in Worcester.

86
00:08:01.193 --> 00:08:02.493
She file a report?

87
00:08:02.793 --> 00:08:05.392
No, that's just it,
no calls, no nothing

88
00:08:19.792 --> 00:08:21.093
Come on.

89
00:08:21.593 --> 00:08:23.492
Let's go talk to
our operator.

90
00:08:35.092 --> 00:08:35.992
Cam?

91
00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:39.391
Maybe nobody's home.

92
00:08:44.491 --> 00:08:46.092
My Surries in for an upgrade

93
00:08:46.092 --> 00:08:47.392
and they gave me
this crappy loaner.

94
00:08:47.692 --> 00:08:48.692
Could you?

95
00:08:49.192 --> 00:08:49.893
Certainly.

96
00:08:59.091 --> 00:09:00.092
Cam?

97
00:09:02.391 --> 00:09:03.902
Cam's a good tenant you know,

98
00:09:03.902 --> 00:09:05.992
pays the rent on time,
never leaves the apartment.

99
00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:23.592
Cam?

100
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:26.890
Cam?

101
00:09:28.691 --> 00:09:29.990
Oh my God!

102
00:09:32.591 --> 00:09:34.191
Don't touch anything, please.

103
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.290
I will call it in.

104
00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.490
-You're sure this is Cameron McAllister?
-Yes!

105
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:58.190
This is Agent Peters, we
tracked down the blonde's operator.

106
00:10:00.789 --> 00:10:01.490
Yeah

107
00:10:03.389 --> 00:10:04.689
Better send a coroner

108
00:10:09.289 --> 00:10:10.890
Connection Failure.

109
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:14.490
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

110
00:13:11.084 --> 00:13:13.450
- Morning.
- Hey.

111
00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:14.385
Oh! Where's your....

112
00:13:14.984 --> 00:13:16.284
In the... charge room.

113
00:13:29.384 --> 00:13:30.885
You pull another all nighter?

114
00:13:31.984 --> 00:13:32.784
Yes I did

115
00:13:35.884 --> 00:13:37.383
Why don't you think
about taking a break?

116
00:13:38.483 --> 00:13:39.583
- A break?
- Mmmm.

117
00:13:40.584 --> 00:13:42.284
I got some vacation
time saved up.

118
00:13:42.884 --> 00:13:43.983
How about Hawaii?

119
00:13:44.783 --> 00:13:46.184
Lisa said she got
an amazing deal.

120
00:13:46.484 --> 00:13:47.384
Hawaii would be great.

121
00:13:47.384 --> 00:13:49.244
She had this totally
buff Surrie in Maui,

122
00:13:49.244 --> 00:13:51.584
She took it surfing,
parasailing, deep sea diving.

123
00:13:52.483 --> 00:13:54.482
You know that rental
place on Boilston?

124
00:13:54.683 --> 00:13:57.883
I was thinking about us. You and
me going away some place together.

125
00:13:58.483 --> 00:14:00.383
And leave our units at home?
Are you kidding?

126
00:14:03.383 --> 00:14:06.183
We could take a drive out to the Cape?
We haven't done that for a while...

127
00:14:06.183 --> 00:14:07.983
Can we talk about this
another time?

128
00:14:08.283 --> 00:14:10.462
You know, I should get to work,
the shops been really busy.....

129
00:14:10.462 --> 00:14:12.482
...Everyone wants new looks for summer and....

130
00:14:15.283 --> 00:14:17.282
Yeah... I was just thinking that...
Ummm...

131
00:14:19.483 --> 00:14:20.883
It just feels like we...

132
00:14:22.582 --> 00:14:25.152
Haven't really spent
much time together lately.

133
00:14:25.152 --> 00:14:26.882
We're together every day.

134
00:14:29.082 --> 00:14:31.082
Surrogates...
Not the same...

135
00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:35.282
It's better.

136
00:14:46.982 --> 00:14:50.781
College West, San Diego.

137
00:14:52.082 --> 00:14:53.582
Yo Canter?

138
00:14:53.982 --> 00:14:55.282
He's been in there all weekend.

139
00:14:55.882 --> 00:14:57.482
He's gonna miss the Psych final.

140
00:15:02.481 --> 00:15:03.581
Jesus!

141
00:15:03.981 --> 00:15:05.381
Somebody call the cops!

142
00:15:06.782 --> 00:15:09.999
We are confronted with an
unprecedented situation.

143
00:15:11.182 --> 00:15:13.781
Two people have died while
connected to their stim chairs.

144
00:15:15.281 --> 00:15:19.080
According to the pathologist, their
brains were liquefied in their skulls.

145
00:15:20.481 --> 00:15:22.581
Whatever happened to
their surrogates, killed them.

146
00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:25.581
Sir?

147
00:15:26.081 --> 00:15:28.481
- How is it even possible?
- We don't know.

148
00:15:30.081 --> 00:15:31.981
I am imposing
a total media blackout.

149
00:15:32.281 --> 00:15:35.080
No one from this office
is going to be responsible

150
00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.580
for setting off
a nationwide panic.

151
00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.380
The public cannot be allowed....

152
00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:42.680
...to get the idea that using
a surrogate can be fatal.

153
00:15:46.881 --> 00:15:49.280
Tuxedo boys last moments.

154
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.179
Get lost meatbag.

155
00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.180
- Looks like we got ourselves a witness.
- Mmmm.

156
00:16:06.279 --> 00:16:07.379
Hang on...

157
00:16:11.979 --> 00:16:14.080
- What is that?
- Exactly...

158
00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.780
- Some kind of weapon.
- Anything yet?

159
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.179
Hang on to yourself, I think we
may actually have a homicide here.

160
00:16:25.179 --> 00:16:26.978
Come here and look at this.

161
00:16:26.978 --> 00:16:28.679
-Are you serious?
-No we don't know that for sure.

162
00:16:29.079 --> 00:16:32.579
Yeah but what if it is a homicide?
When was the last one?

163
00:16:33.779 --> 00:16:35.079
This could be huge.

164
00:16:39.278 --> 00:16:41.479
- Yeah, Lee go.
- We got your next of kin.

165
00:16:41.779 --> 00:16:43.278
I hope you're sitting down.

166
00:16:43.778 --> 00:16:45.878
The kids father is "Lionel Canter".

167
00:16:46.279 --> 00:16:49.199
As in the inventor of surrogates,
"Lionel Canter".

168
00:16:51.779 --> 00:16:54.978
Jarid Canter, son of
Dr. Lionel Canter was found dead

169
00:16:55.278 --> 00:16:57.778
In his Southern California
dormitory this morning

170
00:16:57.778 --> 00:16:59.878
Cause of death
remains unknown.

171
00:17:00.177 --> 00:17:02.378
A college sophmore, Jarid
was the only son

172
00:17:02.378 --> 00:17:05.579
of the man known around the world
as the father of surrogacy.

173
00:17:06.378 --> 00:17:07.978
The Former Chairman of VSI

174
00:17:08.278 --> 00:17:11.379
Shaped it into one of the largest
corporations in the world.

175
00:17:11.379 --> 00:17:14.477
However, a split between
Canter and his VSI partners

176
00:17:14.778 --> 00:17:16.578
Over the direction of the company

177
00:17:16.578 --> 00:17:19.077
Led to Canters firing
seven years ago.

178
00:17:19.878 --> 00:17:23.077
Publicly humiliated and forced out
of the company he helped to build

179
00:17:23.677 --> 00:17:26.378
Canter has since remained
absent from the public eye.

180
00:17:28.577 --> 00:17:30.177
Dr. Canter's expecting you.

181
00:17:30.777 --> 00:17:32.177
He actually lives here?

182
00:17:32.177 --> 00:17:33.277
I didn't say that.

183
00:17:33.778 --> 00:17:35.677
You will be speaking with
one of his surrogates.

184
00:17:39.078 --> 00:17:40.777
I work for Dr. Canter.

185
00:17:42.077 --> 00:17:43.678
His private elevator is this way.

186
00:17:59.577 --> 00:18:01.677
Please, wait in here.

187
00:18:05.576 --> 00:18:06.876
What a nice place.

188
00:18:07.677 --> 00:18:08.876
It should be.

189
00:18:10.176 --> 00:18:12.477
It's a piece of every
surrogate they sell.

190
00:18:20.575 --> 00:18:21.476
Dr. Canter?

191
00:18:22.076 --> 00:18:22.876
That's right.

192
00:18:23.276 --> 00:18:24.476
You're with the FBI?

193
00:18:25.375 --> 00:18:26.276
Yes we are.

194
00:18:27.076 --> 00:18:27.976
This way.

195
00:18:29.076 --> 00:18:31.376
I can't help but notice
the similarities between

196
00:18:31.376 --> 00:18:34.476
your surrogate... and the
one your son Jared was using.

197
00:18:35.376 --> 00:18:37.975
I never really knew
Jarid as a child.

198
00:18:39.575 --> 00:18:42.475
He grew up with his mother in
California Who kept him from me.

199
00:18:43.475 --> 00:18:45.006
When he went to college
I encouraged him....

200
00:18:45.006 --> 00:18:46.876
...to borrow my surrogates
whenever he wanted.

201
00:18:46.876 --> 00:18:48.375
How did you managed to do that?

202
00:18:48.775 --> 00:18:50.976
A Surrie has to be coded
to your neural signature.

203
00:18:51.476 --> 00:18:53.874
I am not exactly your
average VSI consumer.

204
00:18:58.674 --> 00:19:01.075
This was just a way for me
to spend time with my son.

205
00:19:01.375 --> 00:19:04.775
It's a felony to inhabit a surrogate
registered to another operator.

206
00:19:05.475 --> 00:19:08.999
No offense Dr. Canter. We're just
trying to straighten out our facts.

207
00:19:09.376 --> 00:19:10.474
What is this?

208
00:19:11.374 --> 00:19:13.374
- Some kind of Good Cop, Bad Cop routine?
- No sir.

209
00:19:13.374 --> 00:19:14.875
- You trying to handle me?
- No sir.

210
00:19:15.175 --> 00:19:16.574
Because I am not going
to be handled.

211
00:19:16.874 --> 00:19:17.874
Dr Canter...

212
00:19:18.474 --> 00:19:20.575
- I know how you must feel.
- Do you?

213
00:19:21.474 --> 00:19:22.574
Yes, sir.

214
00:19:23.675 --> 00:19:25.375
I lost a son myself.

215
00:19:36.774 --> 00:19:39.474
Do you have any idea why
someone might want to harm Jared?

216
00:19:45.873 --> 00:19:46.673
No.

217
00:19:47.674 --> 00:19:48.574
Or yourself?

218
00:19:54.374 --> 00:19:55.473
Oh my God.

219
00:19:57.074 --> 00:19:58.774
If it was me they were after...

220
00:20:00.373 --> 00:20:02.473
I am responsible for my son's death.

221
00:20:10.673 --> 00:20:13.473
Well... I guess
the interview's over.

222
00:20:33.272 --> 00:20:34.172
No!

223
00:20:37.372 --> 00:20:41.172
<i>Robotic surrogates combine
the durability of machines</i>

224
00:20:41.472 --> 00:20:43.972
<i>With the grace and beauty
of the human form</i>

225
00:20:44.373 --> 00:20:45.972
<i>To make your life safer</i>

226
00:20:46.272 --> 00:20:47.172
<i>And better.</i>

227
00:20:47.172 --> 00:20:50.872
<i>Whether your budget allows
for simplified generic or our.....</i>

228
00:20:50.872 --> 00:20:54.372
<i>Get ready to live your life
without any risk or danger.</i>

229
00:20:55.072 --> 00:20:57.471
<i>You can live your life
without limitations.</i>

230
00:20:58.672 --> 00:21:01.072
<i>And become anyone
you want to be.</i>

231
00:21:01.072 --> 00:21:03.772
<i>From the comfort and
safety of your own home.</i>

232
00:21:04.172 --> 00:21:06.571
<i>VSI, where it all began.</i>

233
00:21:07.371 --> 00:21:09.971
<i>Do what you want.
Be what you want.</i>

234
00:21:11.671 --> 00:21:13.999
- Agents Greer and Peters?
- I am Victor Welsh.

235
00:21:13.999 --> 00:21:15.571
VP of corporate relations.

236
00:21:16.371 --> 00:21:17.471
Please Sit.

237
00:21:17.872 --> 00:21:20.771
- Thanks for taking the time to see us.
- No problem.

238
00:21:21.871 --> 00:21:23.971
You uh...
You must know Andy Stone?

239
00:21:24.271 --> 00:21:25.570
Our immediate superior.

240
00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.170
Do give him my regards.

241
00:21:27.571 --> 00:21:30.870
- We're from the legal department.
- Hope you don't mind if we sit in.

242
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:31.570
Not at all.

243
00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:33.721
The two of you might be interested
in a free software upgrade....

244
00:21:33.721 --> 00:21:35.871
....we're offering all
law enforcement officials.

245
00:21:35.871 --> 00:21:39.971
- Better night vision for your synth units.
- Improved pursuit capability.

246
00:21:39.971 --> 00:21:43.770
You have any idea how a surrogates
head would explode from the inside?

247
00:21:47.271 --> 00:21:49.970
Mr. Welsh isn't qualified
to answer that question.

248
00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:51.771
What do the operators say?

249
00:21:52.171 --> 00:21:53.170
Not much.

250
00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:54.670
They're dead.

251
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:57.589
If you're trying to imply
a link between VSI products....

252
00:21:57.589 --> 00:21:58.999
...and an operators accidental death.....

253
00:21:58.999 --> 00:22:00.269
I am not implying anything.

254
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:03.109
I just want to know how an operator

255
00:22:03.109 --> 00:22:05.259
can be killed by signals
from it's surrogate.

256
00:22:05.259 --> 00:22:06.840
This idea itself is absurd.

257
00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.999
If it were possible it would defeat
the entire purpose of surrogacy.

258
00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:13.450
Surries have jumped from bridges...
Been shot......

259
00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:16.909
Even... blown to bits without the
least bit of harm to their operators.

260
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:18.669
The failsafes always kick in.

261
00:22:18.969 --> 00:22:20.669
I can assure you VSI's products

262
00:22:20.669 --> 00:22:23.169
have the most stringent safety
standards in the industry.

263
00:22:23.169 --> 00:22:24.570
What about a human head?

264
00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:27.469
What would cause
one of them to blow up?

265
00:22:27.869 --> 00:22:28.869
Agent Greer...

266
00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:30.269
We're not doctors.

267
00:22:31.369 --> 00:22:32.069
Honey...

268
00:22:32.469 --> 00:22:33.868
I don't know "WHAT" you are.

269
00:22:34.869 --> 00:22:37.379
I mean for all I know you
could be some big fat dude

270
00:22:37.379 --> 00:22:39.999
sitting in a stim chair
with his dick hanging out.

271
00:22:58.869 --> 00:23:00.569
Interesting technique.

272
00:23:01.468 --> 00:23:02.869
I hate lawyers.

273
00:23:09.168 --> 00:23:10.268
What are you doing?

274
00:23:25.967 --> 00:23:27.268
Mr. Steinberg?

275
00:23:28.668 --> 00:23:30.267
Seth Steinberg?

276
00:23:33.968 --> 00:23:34.767
Hello.

277
00:23:35.067 --> 00:23:35.968
Sorry.

278
00:23:35.968 --> 00:23:37.267
I was in the can.

279
00:23:37.267 --> 00:23:39.667
- This is Agent Peters,
- I am Agent Greer with the FBI.

280
00:23:40.366 --> 00:23:41.167
Really?

281
00:23:44.667 --> 00:23:46.467
An identity chip this damaged......

282
00:23:46.867 --> 00:23:48.967
...Every circuit must have fired off at once.

283
00:23:49.367 --> 00:23:50.368
Kablooey!

284
00:23:51.068 --> 00:23:52.967
Have you ever seen anything
like this before?

285
00:23:53.366 --> 00:23:57.700
Last week a truck load of GI Joes
did come back for re-conditioning.

286
00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.267
And a couple of the
Surries were missing optics.

287
00:24:00.667 --> 00:24:02.167
Mind if we take a look at them?

288
00:24:17.266 --> 00:24:18.566
Here we go.

289
00:24:29.966 --> 00:24:32.665
No bullet holes?
No blast damage?

290
00:24:33.466 --> 00:24:35.966
- No scratches.
- No dirt. No mud.

291
00:24:36.366 --> 00:24:38.366
Mind if I check out
the identity chip?

292
00:24:38.966 --> 00:24:40.966
- Heh. Yeah.
- Why not?

293
00:24:41.566 --> 00:24:42.999
Didn't come back with "one".

294
00:25:03.579 --> 00:25:04.477
I am down!

295
00:25:04.777 --> 00:25:05.574
I am down.

296
00:25:05.574 --> 00:25:08.870
Damn things aren't free Polaski!
Take the snipers from behind this time.

297
00:25:09.169 --> 00:25:09.968
Yes sir!

298
00:25:11.565 --> 00:25:12.763
Back online.

299
00:25:27.436 --> 00:25:28.533
Follow me.

300
00:25:28.533 --> 00:25:31.629
- Keep an eye on Bravo Company.
- We will kick some ass sir!

301
00:25:32.028 --> 00:25:34.422
Agent Greer you're wasting
your time with these questions.

302
00:25:35.321 --> 00:25:36.873
Why on earth would
the Defense Department.....

303
00:25:36.873 --> 00:25:39.813
....want to develop a weapon that
could wipe out our own troops?

304
00:25:39.813 --> 00:25:41.809
So no such weapon exists...

305
00:25:42.109 --> 00:25:44.006
If it did, I would know about it.

306
00:25:44.504 --> 00:25:46.102
And the soldier that we saw?

307
00:25:46.102 --> 00:25:49.296
We routinely remove motherboards
and optics for analysis.

308
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.350
Now if you will excuse me....

309
00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:54.387
We are in the middle
of a peacekeeping operation.

310
00:26:01.473 --> 00:26:03.370
- Check your screen
- What?

311
00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:04.669
Myles Strickland.

312
00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:05.467
Who?

313
00:26:05.467 --> 00:26:07.661
Myles Strickland, meatbag...

314
00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.356
I did a run on criminal records for Moto
Guzzi drivers in black Arai helmets......

315
00:26:11.356 --> 00:26:12.552
......And guess what I found?

316
00:26:12.852 --> 00:26:14.550
He's already in the system.

317
00:26:14.949 --> 00:26:17.944
He was arrested a month ago for
multiple counts of armed robbery.

318
00:26:18.742 --> 00:26:20.339
And what's really weird about this...

319
00:26:21.038 --> 00:26:23.435
After he was busted...
They let him off.

320
00:26:24.032 --> 00:26:25.829
Someone on the inside's
protecting him.

321
00:26:26.228 --> 00:26:28.125
But I put out an APB anyway.

322
00:26:43.796 --> 00:26:45.493
Visual Match.

323
00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:00.565
- Recognition search caught your dready.
- Where?

324
00:27:00.565 --> 00:27:02.762
Dorchester, Gore Park and Adams.

325
00:27:02.762 --> 00:27:04.558
Not far from the reservation.

326
00:27:04.858 --> 00:27:06.955
Boston PD is on its way.

327
00:27:07.554 --> 00:27:09.150
Stay here and keep tabs on him.

328
00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:10.848
- Wait a minute.
- Where are you going?

329
00:27:11.147 --> 00:27:12.545
Dorchester.

330
00:27:13.642 --> 00:27:15.139
It wasn't too difficult.

331
00:27:15.139 --> 00:27:18.134
I put his face in the system and...
Bingo! We found him in an alley.

332
00:27:19.032 --> 00:27:21.228
K33 over there brought it to my attention.

333
00:27:21.528 --> 00:27:22.726
Thanks Jerry.

334
00:27:24.123 --> 00:27:25.999
He's "one of our" best watchers.

335
00:27:25.999 --> 00:27:27.417
He's semi-retired.

336
00:27:27.417 --> 00:27:29.814
So he gets to work out of
his beach house in Maine.

337
00:27:30.212 --> 00:27:32.999
- Pretty sweet huh?
- Yeah, it's a nice set-up you have here.

338
00:27:32.999 --> 00:27:35.303
Yeah, we can access every
Surrie on the grid here.

339
00:27:36.301 --> 00:27:37.598
Touch of a button.

340
00:27:38.097 --> 00:27:39.895
I can tap into anyone's feed.

341
00:27:40.594 --> 00:27:42.489
It's kind of like being
inside God's head.

342
00:27:44.287 --> 00:27:46.777
Ohh, boy...
I felt that one coming.

343
00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:48.778
Bobby Saunders, by the way.

344
00:27:50.674 --> 00:27:51.972
Jennifer Peters.

345
00:27:52.571 --> 00:27:54.867
Yeah... Yeah, you are, aren't you?

346
00:27:56.264 --> 00:27:58.761
- Can I ask you a question?
- Hmm?

347
00:27:58.761 --> 00:27:59.858
Why no surrogate?

348
00:28:00.357 --> 00:28:01.256
Me?

349
00:28:02.254 --> 00:28:03.951
They have been trying
to puppet me for years.

350
00:28:05.048 --> 00:28:07.944
But they ain't built a machine
that can handle this big puppy yet.

351
00:28:07.944 --> 00:28:09.441
Excuse me a second...

352
00:28:11.536 --> 00:28:13.234
We have an assault and
battery in progress.

353
00:28:13.234 --> 00:28:15.430
I need warrants to shut
them down immediately.

354
00:28:16.029 --> 00:28:18.525
Charlie 463 niner.....

355
00:28:18.525 --> 00:28:20.920
Sierra 7855...

356
00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:24.999
Let's see if they have a
security camera in the hotel...

357
00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:29.999
- Excellent, there is one.
- Get her, man!

358
00:28:30.203 --> 00:28:32.400
- Warrant recieved.
- Shut up!

359
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.797
Agent Peters......

360
00:28:34.096 --> 00:28:35.294
Watch this.

361
00:28:35.993 --> 00:28:36.592
Boom.

362
00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:38.089
Boom.

363
00:28:39.285 --> 00:28:41.650
Since when have you been
able to cut off operators?

364
00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:44.078
It's brand new software.
I call it "buffering".

365
00:28:44.078 --> 00:28:46.174
Let's me disconnect anyone
from their surrogate.

366
00:28:46.174 --> 00:28:48.071
Well, that can't be legal?

367
00:28:48.071 --> 00:28:49.668
Ahhh... It's a grey area.

368
00:28:49.668 --> 00:28:51.664
They don't ask, we don't tell.

369
00:28:53.062 --> 00:28:53.959
It's pretty cool, huh?

370
00:28:54.358 --> 00:28:55.457
Awww! Come on.

371
00:28:56.455 --> 00:28:58.351
Relax, we are the good guys.

372
00:29:13.063 --> 00:29:18.029
Latest hit on the bike, turning east on South
Hampton half a mile from the res....

373
00:29:18.029 --> 00:29:20.457
...Greer, be careful, you're heading
straight towards Dread territory.

374
00:29:20.457 --> 00:29:22.437
We don't have jurisdiction
to fly over there.

375
00:29:22.437 --> 00:29:24.535
It's restricted air space.

376
00:29:25.251 --> 00:29:26.928
Greer are you there?

377
00:30:25.857 --> 00:30:29.999
- Stop right there! Freeze!
- He's got a gun!

378
00:30:34.951 --> 00:30:36.448
What was that?

379
00:30:40.237 --> 00:30:42.233
Bank left! Bank left!

380
00:31:07.031 --> 00:31:08.031
Hey!

381
00:32:19.181 --> 00:32:20.878
Fire! Fire!

382
00:32:27.645 --> 00:32:28.976
It's a surrogate!

383
00:32:42.293 --> 00:32:43.453
It's a machine!

384
00:34:14.682 --> 00:34:16.976
I ain't done nothing.
I ain't done nothing.

385
00:34:19.072 --> 00:34:20.368
Give me the bag.

386
00:34:22.263 --> 00:34:23.360
Throw it over here.

387
00:34:25.156 --> 00:34:26.752
Throw it over here.
Now!

388
00:34:55.377 --> 00:34:56.673
You're an abomination.

389
00:34:57.572 --> 00:34:58.669
Oh god.

390
00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:27.441
Maggie.

391
00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.337
Maggie!

392
00:35:32.538 --> 00:35:35.037
Lionel Canter is on the phone. He's
called for Greer a half dozen times.

393
00:35:35.037 --> 00:35:36.737
I can't deal with this right now.

394
00:35:36.737 --> 00:35:39.335
- He's pretty upset.
- Just tell him someone will call him back.

395
00:35:39.335 --> 00:35:40.135
Peters!

396
00:35:40.736 --> 00:35:42.535
- You got to believe me
- I tried to stop him.

397
00:35:42.535 --> 00:35:44.734
Well, you didn't try hard enough.
You're done for the day.

398
00:35:44.734 --> 00:35:45.835
Clock out.

399
00:36:17.074 --> 00:36:20.202
Oh, you're kidding. Turquoise?

400
00:36:20.202 --> 00:36:23.999
I wouldn't carry a purse that color,
much less a whole new suit. Yeah.

401
00:36:25.516 --> 00:36:26.778
Oh, my God.

402
00:36:28.919 --> 00:36:29.517
Tom?

403
00:36:31.717 --> 00:36:32.617
Oh, my God!

404
00:36:32.916 --> 00:36:34.216
Bridge, call an ambulance!

405
00:36:50.309 --> 00:36:51.811
Myles Strickland is it?

406
00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:55.009
Why are you...

407
00:37:02.906 --> 00:37:04.106
What's going on?

408
00:37:04.106 --> 00:37:05.206
Who was it?

409
00:37:05.805 --> 00:37:07.204
Who gave you the weapon?

410
00:37:07.905 --> 00:37:09.204
And paid you to use it?

411
00:37:10.704 --> 00:37:11.803
I don't know!

412
00:37:11.803 --> 00:37:13.502
Myles you can't lie to me.

413
00:37:14.002 --> 00:37:15.000
I am not lying.

414
00:37:15.301 --> 00:37:16.902
I swear to God sir, I am not lying.

415
00:37:17.699 --> 00:37:18.999
He never told me his name.

416
00:37:19.299 --> 00:37:21.000
We talked on
disposable cell phones.

417
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.499
I never saw
his face.

418
00:37:23.098 --> 00:37:25.698
I couldn't tell you who he
was if my life depended on it!

419
00:37:29.297 --> 00:37:31.750
A Police chase through
Dorchester concluded

420
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:34.493
with an FBI helicopter
crash landing

421
00:37:34.795 --> 00:37:36.893
inside Boston's Dread Reservation

422
00:37:37.094 --> 00:37:39.693
Residents of the Reservation
are outraged...

423
00:37:39.693 --> 00:37:41.292
....over what they are calling

424
00:37:41.292 --> 00:37:44.792
a gross violation of their
territorial sovereignity.

425
00:37:44.792 --> 00:37:46.991
Human Coalition Leader,
The Prophet

426
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:50.689
responded to the incident in a statement
made earlier today.

427
00:37:51.187 --> 00:37:52.687
They have attacked us.

428
00:37:52.687 --> 00:37:57.086
Declared War on our way of
life and left us with one option:

429
00:37:57.086 --> 00:37:58.186
Revolution!

430
00:37:58.586 --> 00:38:02.985
We did not throw the first stone.
But we will throw the last.

431
00:38:09.282 --> 00:38:10.181
Hi.

432
00:38:12.181 --> 00:38:12.982
Hey.

433
00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:15.979
How is the headache?

434
00:38:16.779 --> 00:38:17.980
Still there.

435
00:38:20.278 --> 00:38:22.278
- Thanks for being here.
- Of course.

436
00:38:22.278 --> 00:38:25.277
<i>Imagine a World where
children are always safe.</i>

437
00:38:25.277 --> 00:38:27.300
<i>a world where every child</i>

438
00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:29.775
<i>and every parent is secure.</i>

439
00:38:30.076 --> 00:38:32.774
<i>Make every childhood
a happy one.</i>

440
00:38:33.674 --> 00:38:35.174
<i>Surrogates for kids.</i>

441
00:38:35.573 --> 00:38:39.771
<i>Exclusively from VSI.
Where it all Beg...</i>

442
00:38:43.869 --> 00:38:46.969
- Knock Knock. Hey.
- Andy. Hi.

443
00:38:47.768 --> 00:38:48.767
Oh my gosh.

444
00:38:49.267 --> 00:38:51.168
- We haven't seen you forever.
- I know.

445
00:38:51.168 --> 00:38:52.867
I should let you guys talk.

446
00:38:52.867 --> 00:38:55.265
- Will you be okay?
- Mmm-hmm. I will be fine.

447
00:38:56.965 --> 00:38:58.065
I will see you tomorrow morning.

448
00:38:59.163 --> 00:39:00.063
Bye.

449
00:39:00.463 --> 00:39:01.164
Bye.

450
00:39:06.762 --> 00:39:07.761
How bad?

451
00:39:08.261 --> 00:39:10.361
The doctor said you are
lucky to be alive.

452
00:39:10.961 --> 00:39:12.459
Good thing you unplugged.

453
00:39:14.259 --> 00:39:15.758
You got to go get him.

454
00:39:16.257 --> 00:39:17.999
Strickland's got that weapon.

455
00:39:18.357 --> 00:39:19.600
You just get a court order, and you...

456
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.356
There won't be any court
orders, you have been suspended.

457
00:39:22.955 --> 00:39:23.755
For what?

458
00:39:23.755 --> 00:39:26.034
Tom, you have violated our treaty
with the Dreads.

459
00:39:26.034 --> 00:39:27.234
Forget the Treaty!

460
00:39:27.555 --> 00:39:28.653
He killed 5 cops!

461
00:39:28.653 --> 00:39:31.700
Look... I am gonna take care of
this case myself personally. Alright?

462
00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:34.630
Now... I am afraid the bureau
won't be able to supply.....

463
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:37.750
.....you with a new surrogate until
after the official inquiry.

464
00:39:37.951 --> 00:39:39.649
The same goes for your
gun and your badge.

465
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:41.950
Don't think about this now.

466
00:39:48.847 --> 00:39:50.745
He killed 5 cops Andy.

467
00:39:54.645 --> 00:39:56.343
Take some time to heal.

468
00:40:29.331 --> 00:40:30.032
Hey.

469
00:40:30.832 --> 00:40:32.532
- Hey.
- Sorry I am late.

470
00:40:32.532 --> 00:40:33.531
That's ok.

471
00:40:34.329 --> 00:40:37.829
Wow...... You look a lot like
your synth.

472
00:40:38.529 --> 00:40:39.229
Yeah

473
00:40:40.027 --> 00:40:40.828
Should we go?

474
00:40:47.525 --> 00:40:50.626
How long has it been since you have
been out without a Surrie?

475
00:40:51.323 --> 00:40:52.722
I can't even remember.

476
00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.821
I can't believe they didn't give
you something for the anxiety.

477
00:41:15.015 --> 00:41:15.816
Greer?

478
00:41:16.315 --> 00:41:20.750
- Look..... This isn't gonna work.
- I am fine. I have an idea.

479
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.705
Come on... This is a really bad idea.....

480
00:41:45.705 --> 00:41:48.703
It's gonna be alright. I am sure
we will find you something decent.

481
00:41:56.902 --> 00:41:59.799
Now, we're gonna have you
back on your feet in a sec.

482
00:42:01.799 --> 00:42:02.999
Sync looks good.

483
00:42:03.298 --> 00:42:04.697
It's responding well
to signal, right?

484
00:42:06.897 --> 00:42:07.998
It feels numb.

485
00:42:08.296 --> 00:42:09.596
It's only a base model.

486
00:42:10.096 --> 00:42:11.196
It comes with vision and hearing.

487
00:42:11.196 --> 00:42:13.400
If you want other senses
they're extra.

488
00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:17.450
Of course if you like seeing your own face
when you look in the mirror, no problem.

489
00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:19.999
We will just scan your head,
cast the thermo-plastic

490
00:42:19.999 --> 00:42:21.899
and you're good to go
in less than an hour.

491
00:42:21.899 --> 00:42:23.591
Hey, no charge on the improvements.

492
00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:26.091
I am sure you wouldn't mind
taking yourself back

493
00:42:26.091 --> 00:42:29.580
5, 10 years, huh?
What do you think of that? Hmmm?

494
00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:30.890
I think we're done here.

495
00:42:36.986 --> 00:42:37.786
Greer.

496
00:42:44.884 --> 00:42:45.784
Tom.

497
00:42:46.683 --> 00:42:47.483
Tom.

498
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.880
Tom, Come on. you can't come out
here by yourself. It's not safe.

499
00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.779
- I am fine.
- Come on. Let me take you home.

500
00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:54.781
I am not going home.

501
00:42:54.781 --> 00:42:57.479
- Tom.
- You got to forget the case.

502
00:42:57.479 --> 00:43:00.079
Because Stone is going
to run things his way

503
00:43:00.079 --> 00:43:02.577
and as far as we're
concerned, it's over.

504
00:43:02.778 --> 00:43:05.675
It's not over until we
get that weapon back.

505
00:43:07.775 --> 00:43:09.175
Then you got to let me help you.

506
00:43:11.874 --> 00:43:13.974
They're not going to let you in.

507
00:43:13.974 --> 00:43:15.673
Take care of yourself Peters.

508
00:44:04.354 --> 00:44:07.154
Death came for Myles Strickland...

509
00:44:08.553 --> 00:44:11.153
...As death comes to all men.

510
00:44:12.352 --> 00:44:13.551
But for Myles

511
00:44:14.751 --> 00:44:16.250
It's not an ending.

512
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:19.450
It's a new beginning.

513
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:24.999
When you sacrifice your
own personal desires.....

514
00:44:24.999 --> 00:44:28.345
....for a greater cause,
a greater good.

515
00:44:29.947 --> 00:44:31.345
You never die.

516
00:44:32.645 --> 00:44:34.244
You never disappear.

517
00:44:35.445 --> 00:44:37.942
That is what it means
to be human.

518
00:44:39.642 --> 00:44:41.242
There is no alternative

519
00:44:41.842 --> 00:44:44.639
You can try to escape by
living through a puppet

520
00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:47.040
Through a machine.

521
00:44:47.739 --> 00:44:51.738
But deep down inside, you
know you're living a lie

522
00:44:54.137 --> 00:44:56.336
Here, inside these walls

523
00:44:56.636 --> 00:44:58.437
We understand the truth.

524
00:45:01.765 --> 00:45:02.485
Sorry.

525
00:45:04.933 --> 00:45:08.732
We sacrifice many modern
pleasures and conveniences....

526
00:45:08.732 --> 00:45:10.999
....to feel truly connected.

527
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:13.430
Not with machines

528
00:45:16.028 --> 00:45:17.130
But with ourselves.

529
00:45:22.427 --> 00:45:24.326
This is the human condition.

530
00:45:24.727 --> 00:45:26.826
This is what gives life meaning.

531
00:45:27.825 --> 00:45:28.725
My friends.

532
00:45:29.124 --> 00:45:32.624
Soon the day will come
when surrogacy must end.

533
00:45:33.523 --> 00:45:36.100
That day, I promise you.......

534
00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:37.722
.......is close at hand.

535
00:45:38.121 --> 00:45:41.721
The day......
We get a second chance.

536
00:46:11.110 --> 00:46:12.209
Excuse me.

537
00:46:12.209 --> 00:46:15.509
- Excuse me, fellows.
- Whoa. Can I help you? Yeah.

538
00:46:15.808 --> 00:46:17.907
I would like to speak to
"The Prophet" for a minute.

539
00:46:17.907 --> 00:46:19.707
You and everybody else but, no.

540
00:46:19.707 --> 00:46:21.806
What are you, some kind of cop or something?

541
00:46:21.806 --> 00:46:23.407
You got no "jurisdiction" here.

542
00:46:23.407 --> 00:46:25.904
Can I talk to you
about Myles Strickland please?

543
00:46:30.701 --> 00:46:31.702
Enough.

544
00:46:35.301 --> 00:46:37.999
It's different when you
actually feel the pain....

545
00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:39.401
...Isn't it?

546
00:46:41.598 --> 00:46:43.198
What happened to Strickland?

547
00:46:45.297 --> 00:46:46.896
Was he a friend of yours?

548
00:46:47.496 --> 00:46:48.497
He had a weapon.

549
00:46:48.996 --> 00:46:50.696
A very dangerous weapon.

550
00:46:52.095 --> 00:46:56.494
My people will do...
anything to get this back.

551
00:46:57.394 --> 00:47:01.999
Well... if I happen to come
across such a weapon...

552
00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:05.999
I promise to have it
delivered to your door.

553
00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:09.488
Show him to the gates.

554
00:47:11.289 --> 00:47:12.288
Gently.

555
00:47:55.472 --> 00:47:59.999
- Agent Greer.
- May I offer you a ride?

556
00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:04.970
You will have to excuse "my" appearance.

557
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:07.967
It's not safe for me to
use my usual surrogates.

558
00:48:09.268 --> 00:48:10.167
Dr. Canter.

559
00:48:10.167 --> 00:48:12.865
This is one of "VSI's" newer models.

560
00:48:12.865 --> 00:48:14.466
How long have you been following me?

561
00:48:14.466 --> 00:48:18.064
Long enough to know you're getting
nowhere solving my son's murder.

562
00:48:21.562 --> 00:48:23.162
You lost a child Agent Greer?

563
00:48:24.862 --> 00:48:25.561
How?

564
00:48:29.159 --> 00:48:30.660
Car accident.

565
00:48:35.758 --> 00:48:37.258
It was just an accident.

566
00:48:39.056 --> 00:48:40.055
I am sorry.

567
00:48:45.054 --> 00:48:48.554
I can think of no worse tragedy
than a parent outliving a child.

568
00:48:53.252 --> 00:48:55.552
All I can tell you.......

569
00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:58.650
....is that the man who killed
your son is dead.

570
00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:00.149
His name was Myles Strickland.

571
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:02.448
Lived on the Res.

572
00:49:04.447 --> 00:49:05.948
He was killed by his own people.

573
00:49:06.648 --> 00:49:07.547
And that's it?

574
00:49:08.146 --> 00:49:09.146
Case solved?

575
00:49:10.447 --> 00:49:12.544
One man didn't act on his own.

576
00:49:13.943 --> 00:49:15.344
Whatever killed my son...

577
00:49:15.344 --> 00:49:18.900
....was an extraordinarily
sophisticated technology.

578
00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:21.941
Far beyond...
the capability of the Dreads.

579
00:49:21.941 --> 00:49:25.740
We're talking about a
billion-dollar weapons project.

580
00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:27.939
Who do you know spends
money like that?

581
00:49:38.135 --> 00:49:40.999
Focus on the weapon,
where it came from.

582
00:49:58.606 --> 00:49:59.903
Do me.

583
00:50:06.086 --> 00:50:07.883
That was intense.

584
00:50:18.157 --> 00:50:21.049
- Hey Maggie?
- No, thank you.

585
00:50:21.049 --> 00:50:22.999
Come on... It will take the edge off.

586
00:50:32.221 --> 00:50:33.917
Tom?
Honey?

587
00:50:38.405 --> 00:50:40.001
I thought you were still
in the hospital?

588
00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:41.198
Yeah...

589
00:50:42.296 --> 00:50:43.393
I can see that.

590
00:50:43.691 --> 00:50:44.889
What happened to you?

591
00:50:46.884 --> 00:50:50.177
Tom, I don't want you going out
without your Surrie ever again.

592
00:50:50.177 --> 00:50:53.566
- Tom?
- You look very nice, Sexy.

593
00:50:53.566 --> 00:50:56.881
Ok... Don't start. I am sorry, those
guys they're friends of Bridget's.

594
00:50:56.881 --> 00:50:59.551
She brought them over, she
wanted to go to this party...

595
00:50:59.551 --> 00:51:01.148
I didn't even want to go.

596
00:51:01.148 --> 00:51:02.844
How long have you been jacking?

597
00:51:03.144 --> 00:51:04.740
I don't.

598
00:51:05.835 --> 00:51:07.131
I don't do it, Tom.....

599
00:51:07.131 --> 00:51:09.827
....And what does it matter if I did?
Why are you being like this?

600
00:51:09.827 --> 00:51:12.999
- Okay.
- Go have a good time, Maggie.

601
00:51:39.963 --> 00:51:40.987
Tom!

602
00:51:48.328 --> 00:51:49.724
Tom stop it!

603
00:52:11.571 --> 00:52:12.567
Tom?

604
00:52:13.664 --> 00:52:14.960
Tom, what was that?

605
00:52:16.755 --> 00:52:18.999
- What?
- What do you want from me?

606
00:52:26.042 --> 00:52:30.843
I want you. I want my wife.

607
00:52:31.619 --> 00:52:33.114
I am your wife.

608
00:52:33.114 --> 00:52:34.609
And you won't see it.

609
00:52:35.308 --> 00:52:36.606
You're not "her".

610
00:52:37.603 --> 00:52:38.400
No, you're not.

611
00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:44.186
Not...Not... this.

612
00:52:44.985 --> 00:52:47.377
Not this... thing...
This...

613
00:52:49.933 --> 00:52:51.867
...this...

614
00:52:51.867 --> 00:52:53.063
I just want you.

615
00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:57.453
And I want the woman that's
in that room.

616
00:52:57.453 --> 00:52:58.550
My wife.

617
00:53:02.839 --> 00:53:04.435
Things have changed, Tom.

618
00:53:04.734 --> 00:53:06.729
You're... No, you have changed.
You're just scared.

619
00:53:06.729 --> 00:53:09.621
You're just scared...
We could go talk to somebody...

620
00:53:09.621 --> 00:53:13.414
Maggie...
Maggie, don't walk away from me.

621
00:54:14.302 --> 00:54:16.903
Agent Greer?
Is that... Is that you?

622
00:54:17.603 --> 00:54:18.301
Yeah.

623
00:54:19.101 --> 00:54:22.402
- You look... You look terrible.
- Thanks. you too.

624
00:55:04.901 --> 00:55:07.836
The identity chip's completely fried.

625
00:55:07.836 --> 00:55:09.839
What do you got on the girl?

626
00:55:09.839 --> 00:55:12.034
Come on. Let's go talk to her op...

627
00:55:13.543 --> 00:55:15.670
We can access every surrie on the grid.

628
00:55:16.046 --> 00:55:19.379
Touch of a button,
I can tap into anyone's feed.

629
00:55:37.091 --> 00:55:39.491
Transfer to remote operator.

630
00:55:58.688 --> 00:55:59.687
I wish I could help.

631
00:56:00.088 --> 00:56:01.488
This thing killed 5 cops.

632
00:56:01.988 --> 00:56:04.486
One of my men.
It almost put me in the ground.

633
00:56:05.287 --> 00:56:08.188
I know it's a weapon.
I want to know what kind.

634
00:56:08.188 --> 00:56:10.716
You're asking me to compromise
highly classified information.

635
00:56:10.716 --> 00:56:12.156
I know where it is.

636
00:56:12.386 --> 00:56:13.785
Where is it?

637
00:56:14.387 --> 00:56:15.686
Right...

638
00:56:23.085 --> 00:56:24.485
It's called an OD.

639
00:56:25.285 --> 00:56:26.784
Overload Device.

640
00:56:28.383 --> 00:56:31.184
The idea was to end
the battle with one shot.

641
00:56:32.583 --> 00:56:34.881
You beam a software virus
straight to the CPU.

642
00:56:35.383 --> 00:56:37.283
Disables the Surries instantly.

643
00:56:37.883 --> 00:56:40.983
We didn't know the virus
would defeat the built-in fail-safes.

644
00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:43.681
...kill the operators.

645
00:56:43.981 --> 00:56:45.280
Who makes it?

646
00:56:47.281 --> 00:56:48.382
VSI.

647
00:56:50.479 --> 00:56:51.580
After the test

648
00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:54.780
the project was scrapped.

649
00:56:55.879 --> 00:56:57.280
Every unit was destroyed.

650
00:56:57.881 --> 00:56:59.279
Except for this one, right?

651
00:57:02.178 --> 00:57:03.080
Where is it?

652
00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:06.078
Right now, it's in the hands
of the Human Coalition.

653
00:57:06.078 --> 00:57:07.778
- How long have they had it?
- A day...

654
00:57:07.979 --> 00:57:09.179
Maybe two.

655
00:57:10.878 --> 00:57:12.280
This is out of your hands.

656
00:57:12.877 --> 00:57:14.577
Military will handle this.

657
00:57:22.377 --> 00:57:27.670
- You called for us?
- Take this to the federal building downtown.

658
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:29.175
A woman will meet you there.

659
00:57:29.875 --> 00:57:31.776
Agent Jennifer Peters.

660
00:57:32.375 --> 00:57:35.274
You're to give it to her...and her alone.

661
00:57:43.573 --> 00:57:44.472
Peters.

662
00:57:45.473 --> 00:57:46.474
What are you doing?

663
00:57:47.272 --> 00:57:49.173
Just a background check on VSI.

664
00:57:49.873 --> 00:57:51.072
Structural stuff.

665
00:57:51.072 --> 00:57:53.271
Those are
internal financial records.

666
00:57:53.871 --> 00:57:55.372
Talk to Jenkins in corporate.

667
00:57:56.271 --> 00:57:57.070
6th Floor.

668
00:58:02.272 --> 00:58:03.871
Don't forget the cheekbones.

669
00:58:06.069 --> 00:58:07.970
Okay, honey.
Face off.

670
00:58:20.369 --> 00:58:21.367
Maggs....

671
00:58:28.867 --> 00:58:29.866
Hiya, Tom.

672
00:58:32.666 --> 00:58:35.667
Those ugh.....
Smile muscles need to set.

673
00:58:38.466 --> 00:58:40.064
- Hey.
- Hi.

674
00:58:41.565 --> 00:58:42.964
Sorry about last night.

675
00:58:44.064 --> 00:58:45.064
I am at work Tom.

676
00:58:45.463 --> 00:58:47.466
- I didn't come here to argue.
- Good.

677
00:58:52.063 --> 00:58:54.265
See, I feel like I am going crazy.

678
00:58:57.763 --> 00:58:59.762
It's.....I just...

679
00:59:01.463 --> 00:59:02.762
I love you.

680
00:59:03.862 --> 00:59:06.562
I love the smart, beautiful

681
00:59:07.461 --> 00:59:09.261
Intelligent, funny

682
00:59:10.561 --> 00:59:11.660
Woman... and...

683
00:59:13.958 --> 00:59:15.160
I can't sleep.

684
00:59:16.759 --> 00:59:19.259
And when I do...
I have these dreams that are...

685
00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:27.300
And I can't stop thinking about him.

686
00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:29.959
Tom... don't...

687
00:59:30.258 --> 00:59:32.158
Don't you ever think about him?

688
00:59:33.057 --> 00:59:34.957
Of course I think about him, Tom.

689
00:59:34.957 --> 00:59:36.456
You say you don't sleep?

690
00:59:36.658 --> 00:59:38.056
You say you have nightmares?

691
00:59:38.056 --> 00:59:41.355
Well, that girl who you say is funny
and charming and witty...

692
00:59:41.957 --> 00:59:44.256
...and has a great smile...
she doesn't smile anymore.

693
00:59:45.156 --> 00:59:46.256
I don't believe that.

694
00:59:46.554 --> 00:59:49.057
The only reason I can get up in the
morning and get out of the house

695
00:59:49.057 --> 00:59:50.955
Is because "THIS" is who I am now.

696
00:59:51.254 --> 00:59:52.755
- But that's OK, Maggie...
- No, no.

697
00:59:53.154 --> 00:59:54.655
- No.
- Maggie. No!

698
00:59:55.253 --> 00:59:56.554
Maggie wait.

699
01:00:55.846 --> 01:00:58.846
Brothers and sisters, gather
close and prepare yourselves.

700
01:00:59.455 --> 01:01:04.415
<i>The day of the resurrection is upon us.
Today we make history.</i>

701
01:01:04.415 --> 01:01:07.985
- Today we launch the revolution!
- Gotta go now!

702
01:01:13.042 --> 01:01:14.842
You all know what we're looking for.

703
01:01:15.043 --> 01:01:18.742
Remember..... do not fire
unless absolutely necessary.

704
01:01:20.542 --> 01:01:22.041
The biologicals, too.

705
01:01:24.113 --> 01:01:25.710
<i>Over here, over here.</i>

706
01:01:29.118 --> 01:01:30.999
- Over there!
- Take cover!

707
01:01:32.088 --> 01:01:33.112
Ah!

708
01:01:38.439 --> 01:01:43.739
- Cease fire!
- Hands behind your head. Cease fire.

709
01:01:54.238 --> 01:01:55.237
My God.

710
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.933
I couldn't figure out why
the cops let Strickland off.

711
01:02:22.933 --> 01:02:25.734
So, I started going
through the payroll records.

712
01:02:26.833 --> 01:02:28.032
You won't believe this.

713
01:02:28.032 --> 01:02:30.999
- For the past 16 months...
- Working for us.

714
01:02:30.999 --> 01:02:31.933
That's right.

715
01:02:32.730 --> 01:02:34.731
Which means Stone's got to be dirty.

716
01:02:35.432 --> 01:02:38.032
Looks like he hired
Strickland to kill Canter.

717
01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.885
Hey, Tom. Thought you were on leave.

718
01:02:46.885 --> 01:02:48.829
Well, yeah, I am.

719
01:02:48.829 --> 01:02:53.063
Actually, I am just suspended pending...
further investigation.

720
01:02:53.063 --> 01:02:56.970
- But I am just clearing my desk out.
- You should be home, recuperating.

721
01:02:56.970 --> 01:02:59.907
OK? Not walking around here
in the flesh.

722
01:02:59.907 --> 01:03:02.775
I was home. Then I came here
to clean out my desk.

723
01:03:02.775 --> 01:03:07.909
And you know before the medication kicks in,
hopefully, I can find a box and...

724
01:03:08.351 --> 01:03:09.101
Oh!

725
01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:14.320
Victor Welsh wanted me to say hello.

726
01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.484
- I am sorry?
- Victor Welsh, VSI.

727
01:03:16.484 --> 01:03:19.393
The Good-looking kid?
Very excited you're coming over there.

728
01:03:19.393 --> 01:03:22.828
Finally moving into the private sector.
You must be excited, huh?

729
01:03:22.828 --> 01:03:25.425
Why don't you come in my office.
You're not looking too sharp.

730
01:03:25.425 --> 01:03:27.868
Yeah, I got a minute, you know.

731
01:03:27.868 --> 01:03:31.237
It's a good move for you.
It's a really good group over there.

732
01:03:31.237 --> 01:03:33.834
Smart, talented,

733
01:03:33.834 --> 01:03:37.937
great legal department.
It's a great working environment.

734
01:03:39.382 --> 01:03:43.079
And you got to be happy with those
first-year stock options, huh?

735
01:03:43.079 --> 01:03:45.212
What are you talking about?

736
01:03:45.788 --> 01:03:48.484
Miles Strickland. The guy I was chasing.

737
01:03:49.358 --> 01:03:52.816
- The guy you hired to kill Canter.
- Tom, you got it all wrong.

738
01:03:52.816 --> 01:03:56.730
You gave him the weapon.
VSI makes them. They give one to you,

739
01:03:56.730 --> 01:03:59.599
you give it to Strickland
so he can go out and kill Canter.

740
01:03:59.599 --> 01:04:02.035
The only problem is,
he killed his son by mistake.

741
01:04:02.035 --> 01:04:05.131
- Something is wrong with you.
- Why are you doing this?

742
01:04:06.275 --> 01:04:08.106
Money? Is that what it is?

743
01:04:08.744 --> 01:04:10.075
You need help.

744
01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:06.792
<i>This is Stone.</i>

745
01:05:06.792 --> 01:05:10.602
That son of a bitch Greer
disabled my unit! Stop him!

746
01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:15.475
Go! Go!

747
01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:30.589
Jesus. No wonder VSI
wants Canter dead.

748
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:32.594
He's in bed with The Prophet.

749
01:05:32.594 --> 01:05:35.028
He's funding the
anti-surrogacy movement.

750
01:05:35.028 --> 01:05:36.691
He's given them millions.

751
01:05:36.691 --> 01:05:40.998
Crazy bastard invents surrogates then
does everything he can to destroy them.

752
01:05:40.998 --> 01:05:44.700
It doesn't connect Stone to the murder.
We need to link him to the weapon.

753
01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:49.006
He needed codes to use it.
I want you to look for access codes.

754
01:05:49.845 --> 01:05:52.541
We get the codes, we nail Stone.

755
01:06:01.891 --> 01:06:04.826
Good job, Agent Greer. Thank you.

756
01:06:04.826 --> 01:06:07.260
This is Agent Peters. I found Greer.

757
01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:09.696
He's been in an accident
at Market and Hanover.

758
01:08:09.418 --> 01:08:11.943
- FBI!
- Get out of the car.

759
01:08:13.155 --> 01:08:15.783
He's gone. Scan for an identity chip.

760
01:08:15.783 --> 01:08:17.884
He doesn't have one.
He's a meatbag.

761
01:08:17.884 --> 01:08:19.588
There's an exit in back!

762
01:08:48.958 --> 01:08:51.119
Hey! Where you going? Hey!

763
01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:56.988
Bobby, it's Greer.
I need a remote shutdown.

764
01:08:56.988 --> 01:09:01.532
- Agent Peters has been hijacked.
- You have got to disconnect her.

765
01:09:01.971 --> 01:09:03.905
<i>Bobby? Hello, Bobby?</i>

766
01:09:03.905 --> 01:09:07.500
Peters... have you gone insane?

767
01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:09.534
Why don't you put the gun down?

768
01:09:09.534 --> 01:09:14.499
What are you trying to prove? She's
tapping into the entire surrie network!

769
01:09:26.262 --> 01:09:29.390
Maggie, get off line right away,
as soon as you get this message.

770
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:31.189
Something's gonna happen
to the surrogates.

771
01:09:32.568 --> 01:09:33.762
She will only speak to you, sir.

772
01:09:33.762 --> 01:09:35.827
Why don't you just move in and
take her down, huh?

773
01:09:36.472 --> 01:09:38.736
She has a human hostage.

774
01:09:38.736 --> 01:09:41.208
That slob Saunders!

775
01:09:52.221 --> 01:09:53.061
Peters?

776
01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:04.633
- Peters, it's me, Andy Stone.
- That's far enough, Stone.

777
01:10:06.969 --> 01:10:10.132
I know who hired you to kill me.

778
01:10:11.507 --> 01:10:14.999
I hope my old partners
at VSI paid you well.

779
01:10:16.078 --> 01:10:18.512
Did you feel even a second of remorse

780
01:10:18.512 --> 01:10:21.141
when you found out
you'd murdered an innocent boy?

781
01:10:21.917 --> 01:10:23.111
Canter.

782
01:10:24.453 --> 01:10:25.818
I don't believe it.

783
01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:29.487
OK... How about
you tell me something, doctor.

784
01:10:30.059 --> 01:10:33.495
Huh? What did you expect VSI to do?

785
01:10:33.495 --> 01:10:36.589
Just stand by while you tore down
everything they built?

786
01:10:37.132 --> 01:10:39.760
You left us no choice
but to take you out.

787
01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:44.171
You create this technology, you change the
world, and now you want to destroy it?

788
01:10:44.171 --> 01:10:47.573
So what? So you can take us backwards?

789
01:10:48.577 --> 01:10:50.340
So we can all live like dreads?

790
01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:56.481
So we can live like human beings.

791
01:10:58.520 --> 01:10:59.885
Really, doctor.

792
01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:03.083
You should learn
how to live with your regrets.

793
01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:05.951
Now, give me the gun.

794
01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:14.226
No!

795
01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:37.382
That's for my son.

796
01:11:48.737 --> 01:11:52.036
I need to see your boss.
I need to see Dr. Canter right away.

797
01:11:52.036 --> 01:11:55.305
Oh, good. Listen to me.
I got to see your boss, Dr. Canter.

798
01:11:55.305 --> 01:11:56.305
Hey!

799
01:11:58.847 --> 01:12:00.872
Don't! Oh, Jesus!

800
01:12:07.222 --> 01:12:09.087
<i>Device connected.</i>

801
01:12:14.029 --> 01:12:16.054
Over here, officers. This way.

802
01:12:36.218 --> 01:12:38.584
<i>Warning. Commencing upload.</i>

803
01:14:19.988 --> 01:14:21.012
Hello, Tom.

804
01:14:25.194 --> 01:14:28.686
Nice to finally meet you...
in the flesh.

805
01:14:35.804 --> 01:14:38.967
Now, lie on the floor face down.

806
01:14:41.143 --> 01:14:44.772
It's a little different when you have to
kill somebody with your own hands.

807
01:14:44.772 --> 01:14:46.110
When you have to squeeze the trigger.

808
01:14:46.110 --> 01:14:48.048
When you don't have a machine
to do your dirty work.

809
01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:51.543
Feel that?

810
01:14:52.521 --> 01:14:55.319
The accelerated pulse?
The heightened awareness?

811
01:14:55.624 --> 01:14:58.388
Savoring each breath
as if it were your last?

812
01:14:58.388 --> 01:15:02.386
That's what you have been missing.
It's what everybody's been missing.

813
01:15:02.386 --> 01:15:03.728
So you kill millions of people.

814
01:15:03.728 --> 01:15:07.599
I changed the course of human history
when I invented surrogates.

815
01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:12.036
- Now I am going to change it back.
- You can't change what's been done.

816
01:15:13.775 --> 01:15:15.868
You and I know that
better than most people.

817
01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:22.249
My son's death will not have been
in vain. Not if it heals mankind.

818
01:15:23.919 --> 01:15:26.012
Heals mankind?

819
01:15:26.012 --> 01:15:28.716
That's what you want to do?
You want to kill everyone?

820
01:15:28.716 --> 01:15:31.555
- And that's going to heal mankind?
- They're already dead.

821
01:15:31.555 --> 01:15:34.027
They died the minute
they plugged into those machines.

822
01:15:34.027 --> 01:15:36.394
- This is not the solution!
- That's the way it is.

823
01:15:36.394 --> 01:15:38.592
- That's not the way it is!
- I had a vision.

824
01:15:38.592 --> 01:15:40.534
I was going to empower the powerless.

825
01:15:41.003 --> 01:15:44.370
To enable others like me
to walk, to feel,

826
01:15:44.370 --> 01:15:46.237
- to live a normal life.
- Listen to me!

827
01:15:46.237 --> 01:15:48.607
They're going to call you a murderer!
That's what you're doing.

828
01:15:48.607 --> 01:15:52.375
Surrogacy is a perversion.
It's an addiction.

829
01:15:52.375 --> 01:15:54.974
And you have to kill the addict
to kill the addiction.

01:16:01.413 --> 01:16:07.088
Now you're going to be a witness

a virus into the system

840
01:16:58.808 --> 01:17:01.907
that's going to kill anyone

841
01:17:01.907 --> 01:17:03.110
It's already started.

- Oh, shit.
- Think!

01:17:10.993 --> 01:17:12.243
Uh...

845
01:17:14.363 --> 01:17:16.388
OK. Move over to
the terminal to the left.

846
01:17:16.865 --> 01:17:19.060
Type in password "red 253."

847
01:17:19.768 --> 01:17:22.566
We can't unplug it,
but maybe we can buffer the operators.

848
01:17:23.105 --> 01:17:26.131
Oh, God. OK, we got ten seconds.

849
01:17:29.911 --> 01:17:33.608
OK, look, there are three boxes.
Type in "tango" in the first,

850
01:17:33.608 --> 01:17:37.415
"X-ray" in the second,
"772" in the third. Hit "enter"!

- Shit!
- Hit enter! What happened...?

852
01:17:42.754 --> 01:17:46.522
Ah, shit! Shift and enter.
Shift and enter.

853
01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:49.217
Aah...

854
01:17:54.603 --> 01:17:56.662
We just saved
about a billion lives there.

855
01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:01.466
OK, now we got to keep the surrogates
from getting fried.

856
01:18:01.466 --> 01:18:04.809
Please go back to the first terminal,
hit the enter key.

857
01:18:04.809 --> 01:18:06.279
Hit the enter key, please!

858
01:18:08.183 --> 01:18:09.616
Good. Now press "yes."

859
01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:18.550
So that's it? Everyone's safe?

860
01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:19.855
- What?
- All the people?

861
01:18:19.855 --> 01:18:22.693
- Yes. Yes. Of course. Yes.
- All the operators are safe.

862
01:18:22.693 --> 01:18:26.064
But if you don't press abort, all the
surries are going to be destroyed.

863

01:23:30.767 --> 01:23:32.773
<i>possibly in the entire United States.</i>

877
01:23:32.773 --> 01:23:36.709
<i>...describing an identical failure in 
those cities. This is unbelievable.</i>

878
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:39.043
<i>No reports
of human casualties.</i>

879
01:23:39.043 --> 01:23:41.776
<i>The damage appears limited
only to surrogate units.</i>

880
01:23:41.776 --> 01:23:43.750
<i>Thus far,
no statements from VSI.</i>

881
01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:46.185
<i>They have not responded
to requests for information.</i>

882
01:23:46.185 --> 01:23:49.418
<i>Paris, London, Beijing,
all reporting the same thing.</i>

883
01:23:49.418 --> 01:23:54.793
<i>So, still no official word when or
if surrogate services can be restored.</i>

884
01:23:54.793 --> 01:23:59.562
<i>It appears, at least for now,
that we're on our own.</i>
