1
00:02:27.732 --> 00:02:29.525
Harry, answer that.

2
00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:34.738
So, what do you wanna
hack for, Bickle?

3
00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.406
I can't sleep nights.

4
00:02:36.658 --> 00:02:40.369
- There's porno theaters for that.
- Yeah, I know. I tried that.

5
00:02:45.124 --> 00:02:46.667
So, what do you do now?

6
00:02:46.918 --> 00:02:50.754
Now? Ride around nights mostly.
Subways, buses.

7
00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:53.882
Figure I'm gonna do that,
I might as well get Paid for it.

8
00:02:54.092 --> 00:02:56.426
You wanna work uptown?
South Bronx, Harlem?

9
00:02:56.636 --> 00:02:58.345
I'll work anytime, anywhere.

10
00:02:58.555 --> 00:03:00.013
Will you work Jewish holidays?

11
00:03:00.181 --> 00:03:01.932
Anytime, anywhere.

12
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.560
All right.
Let me see your chauffeur's license.

13
00:03:07.146 --> 00:03:09.606
- How's your driving record?
- It's clean.

14
00:03:09.858 --> 00:03:11.984
It's real clean, like my conscience.

15
00:03:12.193 --> 00:03:15.988
You gonna break my chops? I got
enough trouble with guys like you.

16
00:03:16.197 --> 00:03:19.575
If you're gonna break my chops,
you can take it on the arches.

17
00:03:19.742 --> 00:03:22.160
Sorry, sir, I didn't mean that.

18
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.539
- Physical?
- Clean.

19
00:03:25.748 --> 00:03:27.541
- Age?
- Twenty-six.

20
00:03:27.792 --> 00:03:29.459
Education?

21
00:03:29.878 --> 00:03:31.128
Some.

22
00:03:32.297 --> 00:03:33.422
Here, there, you know.

23
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.719
Military record?

24
00:03:38.928 --> 00:03:41.138
Honorable discharge.

25
00:03:41.598 --> 00:03:43.640
May 1 973.

26
00:03:43.892 --> 00:03:45.851
- Were you in the Army?
- Marines.

27
00:03:48.021 --> 00:03:50.105
I was in the Marines too.

28
00:03:52.692 --> 00:03:54.484
So, what is it?

29
00:03:54.777 --> 00:03:56.778
You need an extra job?

30
00:03:57.614 --> 00:03:59.281
Are you moonlighting?

31
00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:03.285
Well, I...
I just wanna work long hours.

32
00:04:03.536 --> 00:04:04.953
What's moonlighting?

33
00:04:05.163 --> 00:04:08.290
Look, just fill out these forms
and check back tomorrow...

34
00:04:08.458 --> 00:04:10.459
when the shift breaks.

35
00:04:10.627 --> 00:04:12.294
O'Brien, Please step up.

36
00:04:12.503 --> 00:04:15.047
Take the car out
through 58th Street, please.

37
00:04:15.298 --> 00:04:17.090
Because it's crowded on 57th.

38
00:04:18.384 --> 00:04:20.761
Hey, Rodriguez!

39
00:04:26.768 --> 00:04:30.771
All right, all right,
I'm coming down there.

40
00:05:12.647 --> 00:05:14.356
May 1 0th.

41
00:05:14.524 --> 00:05:16.817
Thank God for the rain,
which has washed away...

42
00:05:16.985 --> 00:05:20.320
the garbage and the trash
off the sidewalks.

43
00:05:21.322 --> 00:05:23.115
I'm working long hours now.

44
00:05:23.366 --> 00:05:27.119
Six in the afternoon to 6 in the morning,
sometimes even 8 in the morning.

45
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.455
Six days a week,
sometimes seven days a week.

46
00:05:30.707 --> 00:05:33.583
It's a long hustle,
but it keeps me real busy.

47
00:05:33.835 --> 00:05:36.044
I can take in $300, $350 a week.

48
00:05:36.295 --> 00:05:38.839
Sometimes even more
when I do it off the meter.

49
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.283
All the animals come out at night.

50
00:06:06.993 --> 00:06:11.538
Whores, skunk-pussies, buggers,
queens, fairies, dopers, junkies.

51
00:06:13.207 --> 00:06:14.708
Sick, venal.

52
00:06:17.962 --> 00:06:22.299
Someday a real rain'll come and
wash all this scum off the streets.

53
00:06:29.682 --> 00:06:34.269
I go all over. I take people to the
Bronx, Brooklyn. I take them to Harlem.

54
00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:37.439
I don't care.
Don't make no difference to me.

55
00:06:38.066 --> 00:06:41.234
It does to some.
Some won't even take spooks.

56
00:06:41.486 --> 00:06:43.028
Don't make no difference to me.

57
00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:44.863
Driver, 48th and 6th, Please.

58
00:06:45.073 --> 00:06:49.159
Man, you are gorgeous!
Beautiful Little girl.

59
00:06:51.954 --> 00:06:53.955
I can't afford
to get stopped anywhere.

60
00:06:54.165 --> 00:06:56.333
Oh, no.
We wouldn't want that to happen.

61
00:06:57.001 --> 00:07:00.253
There'll be a big tip in it for you,
you do the right things.

62
00:07:00.797 --> 00:07:04.049
You got a way.

63
00:07:05.093 --> 00:07:07.719
Yeah. Now you're talking!

64
00:07:08.096 --> 00:07:10.430
Driver, hurry up, will you?

65
00:07:48.344 --> 00:07:50.137
Each night when I return the cab...

66
00:07:50.304 --> 00:07:53.181
I have to clean the come
off the back seat.

67
00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.480
Some nights, I clean off the blood.

68
00:08:33.931 --> 00:08:35.348
Can I help you?

69
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.601
Yeah, what's your name?

70
00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:39.186
My name is Travis.

71
00:08:39.437 --> 00:08:42.189
That's nice.
What can I do for you?

72
00:08:43.482 --> 00:08:46.234
I'd like to know what your name is.
What's your name?

73
00:08:47.278 --> 00:08:48.486
Give me a break.

74
00:08:48.696 --> 00:08:52.616
Look, you can tell me what your
name is. I'm not gonna do anything.

75
00:08:52.867 --> 00:08:56.453
- Do you want me to call the manager?
- You don't have to call the manager.

76
00:08:56.621 --> 00:09:00.123
- Troy!
- All right. Okay, I mean...

77
00:09:00.583 --> 00:09:04.502
Okay. Can I have a Chuckles there?

78
00:09:05.379 --> 00:09:09.799
And do you have any Jujubes? They
last longer. I'd like to get some Jujubes.

79
00:09:10.009 --> 00:09:12.219
What you see is what we got.

80
00:09:16.849 --> 00:09:18.892
A Clark.

81
00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.854
I'll take these.

82
00:09:25.441 --> 00:09:26.691
Coca-Cola.

83
00:09:26.901 --> 00:09:30.779
We don't have Coca-Cola.
Royal Crown Cola is all we got.

84
00:09:31.989 --> 00:09:34.115
A dollar eighty-five.

85
00:09:56.264 --> 00:09:59.557
Twelve hours of work
and I still can't sleep.

86
00:10:00.476 --> 00:10:01.685
Damn.

87
00:10:01.936 --> 00:10:05.981
The days go on and on.
And they don't end.

88
00:10:07.483 --> 00:10:10.860
All my life needed was
a sense of some place to go.

89
00:10:11.112 --> 00:10:15.448
I don't believe that one should devote
his life to morbid self-attention.

90
00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.994
I believe that someone should
become a person like other people.

91
00:10:21.914 --> 00:10:26.293
I first saw her at Palantine campaign
headquarters at 63rd and Broadway.

92
00:10:27.461 --> 00:10:30.255
She was wearing a white dress.

93
00:10:30.589 --> 00:10:32.924
She appeared like an angel...

94
00:10:33.384 --> 00:10:36.052
out of this filthy mass.

95
00:10:36.304 --> 00:10:38.138
She is alone.

96
00:10:39.473 --> 00:10:40.849
They...

97
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:42.726
cannot...

98
00:10:43.311 --> 00:10:44.602
touch...

99
00:10:45.438 --> 00:10:46.688
her.

100
00:10:58.117 --> 00:11:01.077
Yes. Well, you delivered two boxes.

101
00:11:01.245 --> 00:11:04.039
I think it's a total
of 5000 campaign buttons.

102
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:07.584
Now, all the ones we had before
and our slogan is:

103
00:11:07.835 --> 00:11:10.503
"We are the people,"
and "are" is underlined.

104
00:11:10.755 --> 00:11:13.214
These new buttons
have "we" underlined.

105
00:11:13.466 --> 00:11:18.011
That reads, "We are the people."
Well, I think there's a difference.

106
00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:22.140
"We are the people" is not
the same as "We are the People."

107
00:11:22.558 --> 00:11:24.434
Let's not fight.

108
00:11:25.144 --> 00:11:27.354
Look, we'll make it real simple.

109
00:11:27.605 --> 00:11:29.689
We don't Pay for the buttons.

110
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:34.235
- We throw the buttons away, all right?
- Tom, come here a minute.

111
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.155
What?

112
00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:44.871
What is it?

113
00:11:45.039 --> 00:11:49.459
If Andy okays this canvass report,
send a copy to all headquarters.

114
00:11:49.668 --> 00:11:51.961
I gotta get that New York Times article
xeroxed.

115
00:11:52.213 --> 00:11:54.714
- Don't forget the new photos.
- I didn't forget.

116
00:11:54.924 --> 00:11:59.177
We have to emphasize mandatory
welfare. That's the issue to push.

117
00:11:59.387 --> 00:12:01.262
First Push the man, then the issue.

118
00:12:01.472 --> 00:12:03.473
Senator Palantine is a dynamic man.

119
00:12:03.724 --> 00:12:06.726
An intelligent, interesting,
fresh, fascinating man.

120
00:12:06.936 --> 00:12:08.103
You forgot sexy.

121
00:12:08.312 --> 00:12:09.687
I did not forget sexy.

122
00:12:09.855 --> 00:12:12.524
Listen to you. You sound
like you're selling mouthwash.

123
00:12:12.733 --> 00:12:13.900
We are selling mouthwash.

124
00:12:14.068 --> 00:12:16.069
- Are we authorized to do that?
- Very funny.

125
00:12:16.237 --> 00:12:19.489
You can get in trouble selling
pharmaceuticals in a campaign office.

126
00:12:19.657 --> 00:12:22.200
My uncle's in jail because of that.

127
00:12:22.618 --> 00:12:26.538
It's not really jail. Of course, living
with his wife, anything would be jail.

128
00:12:26.747 --> 00:12:28.039
Look over there.

129
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:29.499
I love you.

130
00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:30.834
Notice anything?

131
00:12:31.043 --> 00:12:33.253
- No.
- Well, Put your glasses on.

132
00:12:33.504 --> 00:12:36.047
Okay, just a minute. All right.

133
00:12:36.257 --> 00:12:38.550
That taxi driver's been staring at us.

134
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.102
What taxi driver?

135
00:12:49.353 --> 00:12:51.438
That one, the one that's sitting there.

136
00:12:51.689 --> 00:12:55.024
- How long has he been there?
- I don't know. It feels like a long time.

137
00:12:55.776 --> 00:12:58.069
- Does he bother you?
- No.

138
00:12:58.362 --> 00:13:00.363
You mean yes,
and you're being sarcastic.

139
00:13:00.573 --> 00:13:02.449
Oh, you're quick.
You're really quick.

140
00:13:02.658 --> 00:13:04.200
Well, I try to be real quick.

141
00:13:04.452 --> 00:13:06.661
I'll Play the male
in this relationship...

142
00:13:06.871 --> 00:13:08.121
Good luck.

143
00:13:08.372 --> 00:13:11.666
And tell him to move. And I don't
need good luck. Thank you.

144
00:13:11.917 --> 00:13:14.627
Oh, yes, you do.
You just think you don't.

145
00:13:22.761 --> 00:13:26.639
Say, you're blocking our doorway.
You think you might move your cab?

146
00:15:07.366 --> 00:15:10.076
You know, eye shadow, mascara...

147
00:15:10.536 --> 00:15:11.786
lipstick, rouge.

148
00:15:12.037 --> 00:15:14.872
Not rouge. Blush-on, they call it.

149
00:15:15.791 --> 00:15:19.460
- The kind with the brush.
- Yeah, it's Blush-on.

150
00:15:21.297 --> 00:15:22.338
Travis.

151
00:15:22.798 --> 00:15:26.342
- Hey, Wiz.
- That's Blush-on. My wife uses it.

152
00:15:26.969 --> 00:15:28.636
Ask Travis. He's a ladies'' man.

153
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:31.264
A cup of coffee, Please.

154
00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:34.267
Anyway, whatever the fuck it is,
she uses a lot of it.

155
00:15:34.476 --> 00:15:36.894
And then perfume. The spray kind.

156
00:15:37.062 --> 00:15:39.606
Get this. In the middle
of the Triborough bridge...

157
00:15:39.815 --> 00:15:43.026
And this woman is beautiful.
- -she changes her Pantyhose.

158
00:15:43.277 --> 00:15:44.527
- No.
- Oh, yeah.

159
00:15:44.737 --> 00:15:47.822
- What'd you do?
- I throw the meter, you know...

160
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:52.410
and I jump in the back seat and whip
it out. I said, "You know what this is?"

161
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:55.413
She says, "It's love."
I'm gonna fuck her brains out.

162
00:15:55.623 --> 00:15:57.248
She goes wild and she said:

163
00:15:57.416 --> 00:16:00.168
"That's the greatest
single experience of my life."

164
00:16:00.461 --> 00:16:03.921
Then she gave me a $200 tip
and her phone number in Acapulco.

165
00:16:05.382 --> 00:16:07.425
Travis, you know Doughboy,
Charlie T.?

166
00:16:09.386 --> 00:16:11.846
Hey, Travis.
Got change for a nickel?

167
00:16:12.056 --> 00:16:14.432
Doughboy'll do anything for a buck.

168
00:16:16.894 --> 00:16:18.686
So how's it hanging?

169
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:24.317
What's that?

170
00:16:26.987 --> 00:16:31.199
I turn on the radio. Some fleet driver
from Bell just got all cut up.

171
00:16:31.367 --> 00:16:32.492
Stickup?

172
00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:36.412
No, he got cut up by some
crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.

173
00:16:36.622 --> 00:16:40.249
- Where?
- It was at 122nd Street.

174
00:16:41.627 --> 00:16:42.835
Fucking Mau Mau Land.

175
00:16:46.548 --> 00:16:49.133
You run all over town,
don't you, Travis?

176
00:16:50.594 --> 00:16:52.595
Travis?

177
00:16:56.266 --> 00:16:58.351
Travis.

178
00:16:58.811 --> 00:17:01.521
- You run all over town, don't you?
- Yeah.

179
00:17:01.689 --> 00:17:04.065
You handle some
pretty rough customers, huh?

180
00:17:04.316 --> 00:17:05.817
Yeah, I have.

181
00:17:06.318 --> 00:17:09.278
- You carry a Piece?
- No.

182
00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:11.572
- You need one?
- No.

183
00:17:12.116 --> 00:17:14.992
I know a fella who can get you
a real nice deal.

184
00:17:15.244 --> 00:17:17.078
There's lots of shit around.

185
00:17:17.371 --> 00:17:19.747
I never use mine.
I'm conservative, you know.

186
00:17:21.208 --> 00:17:23.835
But it's a good thing to have
just as a threat.

187
00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:37.098
I'm gonna go dig my dirt.

188
00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:39.976
Travis.

189
00:17:41.478 --> 00:17:42.729
Look.

190
00:17:43.605 --> 00:17:46.065
Piece of Errol Flynn's bathtub.

191
00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:48.192
Dig the symbols.

192
00:17:48.444 --> 00:17:52.238
F-4-0-5-4-3-4.

193
00:17:53.407 --> 00:17:55.241
And the watermark.

194
00:17:55.451 --> 00:17:57.160
There's one Person...

195
00:17:57.411 --> 00:17:59.036
there's two Persons...

196
00:17:59.246 --> 00:18:00.747
and there's three persons.

197
00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:03.166
I got this at his estate, The Pines.

198
00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:05.626
Why don't you take it,
and if you can sell it...

199
00:18:05.794 --> 00:18:09.630
- you give me half of what you got.
- I don't want to.

200
00:18:10.299 --> 00:18:12.550
Hey, I'm gonna get in my cab
and boogie.

201
00:18:27.441 --> 00:18:29.984
- Oh, I'm so terribly sorry.
- Well...

202
00:18:30.986 --> 00:18:34.030
- Nothing.
- That's very cute. Thank you.

203
00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:36.115
Hey, you wanna see something?

204
00:18:36.909 --> 00:18:39.869
Wait, I just typed,
"you wanna see something?"

205
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:42.872
- What?
- If you had...

206
00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.333
these three fingers
missing on this hand...

207
00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:47.794
and that hand missing
on that hand...

208
00:18:48.837 --> 00:18:51.672
- how would you light the match?
- I wouldn't.

209
00:18:52.049 --> 00:18:54.050
Go ahead. Give it a try.

210
00:18:55.886 --> 00:18:58.012
Well, I don't think I could do it.

211
00:18:58.263 --> 00:18:59.514
No?

212
00:18:59.765 --> 00:19:01.390
It's gonna be difficult.

213
00:19:01.809 --> 00:19:03.434
I'll give it a try.

214
00:19:11.193 --> 00:19:14.278
I got my thumb back for a second.
Thank God.

215
00:19:15.572 --> 00:19:16.989
Just a minute.

216
00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:26.040
I can't do it.

217
00:19:26.542 --> 00:19:28.292
The guy at the newsstand can do it.

218
00:19:28.502 --> 00:19:30.545
Well, I don't work at a newsstand.

219
00:19:32.089 --> 00:19:33.798
- Anyway, he's Probably Italian.
- No.

220
00:19:34.049 --> 00:19:35.591
- You're sure?
- He's black.

221
00:19:35.801 --> 00:19:39.136
If he had been Italian, he might've been
a thief. The mob does that.

222
00:19:39.388 --> 00:19:42.974
If a thief screws up on the job,
they'll blow his fingers off.

223
00:19:43.308 --> 00:19:45.726
This sounds like a joke,
but it's true.

224
00:19:45.936 --> 00:19:49.105
If they kill a stool pigeon,
they leave a canary on the body.

225
00:19:49.314 --> 00:19:52.608
- It's symbolic.
- Why not a Pigeon instead of a canary?

226
00:19:52.818 --> 00:19:55.528
I don't know why not a Pigeon.
Wait a minute.

227
00:19:55.737 --> 00:19:59.615
You gotta catch a pigeon. A canary,
you can walk into a Pet store...

228
00:19:59.825 --> 00:20:02.618
boom, kill it right there.
Put it on anyone you want.

229
00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:32.940
- Hi. I'd like to volunteer.
- Great. I'll take you right over here.

230
00:20:33.191 --> 00:20:35.818
I'd rather volunteer to her,
if you don't mind.

231
00:20:39.656 --> 00:20:41.908
Why do you feel
you have to volunteer to me?

232
00:20:42.117 --> 00:20:46.245
Because I think that you are the most
beautiful woman I have ever seen.

233
00:20:48.832 --> 00:20:50.041
Thanks.

234
00:20:50.292 --> 00:20:52.501
But what do you think of Palantine?

235
00:20:56.006 --> 00:20:57.715
Well, I...

236
00:20:57.883 --> 00:21:01.177
Palantine, the man you're volunteering
to help elect President.

237
00:21:02.804 --> 00:21:04.597
I'm sure he'll make a good President.

238
00:21:04.765 --> 00:21:08.184
I don't know what his Policies are,
but I'm sure he'll make a good one.

239
00:21:09.853 --> 00:21:12.271
- You wanna canvass?
- Yeah, I'll canvass.

240
00:21:12.564 --> 00:21:15.066
How do you feel about
the senator's stand on welfare?

241
00:21:15.275 --> 00:21:19.737
I don't really know his stand on
welfare, but I'm sure it's a good stand.

242
00:21:19.988 --> 00:21:22.865
- You're sure of that?
- Yeah.

243
00:21:25.243 --> 00:21:27.536
We all work together here,
day and night...

244
00:21:27.788 --> 00:21:30.915
so I'm sure the gentlemen
will sign you up over there.

245
00:21:31.166 --> 00:21:35.670
The thing is, I drive a taxi at night,
so it's kind of hard for me...

246
00:21:35.921 --> 00:21:38.047
to work in the day.

247
00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:41.300
Then what exactly do you want?

248
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:44.261
Would you like to come have
some coffee and pie with me?

249
00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:45.721
Why?

250
00:21:45.973 --> 00:21:48.140
- Why? I'll tell you why.
- Yeah.

251
00:21:49.726 --> 00:21:51.435
I think you're a lonely person.

252
00:21:51.979 --> 00:21:54.271
I drive by a lot, and I see you here.

253
00:21:54.481 --> 00:21:56.482
I see a lot of people around you...

254
00:21:56.692 --> 00:21:59.777
and I see these Phones
and all this stuff on your desk...

255
00:21:59.987 --> 00:22:01.320
that means nothing.

256
00:22:01.571 --> 00:22:03.656
And when I came inside and met you...

257
00:22:03.907 --> 00:22:06.617
I saw in your eyes
and how you carried yourself...

258
00:22:06.868 --> 00:22:09.036
that you're not a happy Person.

259
00:22:09.663 --> 00:22:11.414
And I think you need something.

260
00:22:11.623 --> 00:22:14.500
And if you wanna call it a friend,
you can call it a friend.

261
00:22:15.252 --> 00:22:18.796
- You're gonna be my friend?
- Yeah.

262
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.180
What do you say?

263
00:22:32.352 --> 00:22:36.022
It's a little hard standing here
and asking you, so...

264
00:22:40.318 --> 00:22:43.988
Five minutes, that's all.
Just outside. Right around here.

265
00:22:44.197 --> 00:22:45.906
I'm there to protect you.

266
00:22:51.997 --> 00:22:54.248
Come on. Just take a little break.

267
00:22:57.169 --> 00:22:59.503
I have a break at 4:00.
And if you're here...

268
00:22:59.755 --> 00:23:01.756
- 4:00 today?
- Yes.

269
00:23:01.965 --> 00:23:04.884
- I'll be here.
- I'm sure you will.

270
00:23:05.302 --> 00:23:08.012
- All right, 4 p.m.
- Right.

271
00:23:08.597 --> 00:23:10.056
- Outside in the front?
- Yes.

272
00:23:10.223 --> 00:23:11.474
Okay.

273
00:23:11.641 --> 00:23:14.101
Oh, my name is Travis. Betsy?

274
00:23:15.062 --> 00:23:16.937
Travis.

275
00:23:17.522 --> 00:23:19.690
I appreciate this, Betsy.

276
00:23:34.372 --> 00:23:36.624
May 26th, 4:00 p.m.

277
00:23:36.917 --> 00:23:40.753
I took Betsy to Charles' Coffee Shop
on Columbus Circle.

278
00:23:41.797 --> 00:23:46.383
I had black coffee and apple pie
with a slice of melted yellow cheese.

279
00:23:46.593 --> 00:23:48.844
I think that was a good selection.

280
00:23:49.054 --> 00:23:51.388
Betsy had coffee
and a fruit salad dish.

281
00:23:51.598 --> 00:23:53.516
She could've had
anything she wanted.

282
00:23:53.725 --> 00:23:56.435
Fifteen thousand volunteers
in New york alone's not bad.

283
00:23:56.686 --> 00:23:58.479
But the organizational problems.

284
00:24:00.565 --> 00:24:03.609
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I got the same Problems.

285
00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:08.906
I gotta get organized. Little things,
like my apartment, my Possessions.

286
00:24:09.699 --> 00:24:13.536
I should get one of those signs: "One
of these days, I'll get organiz-ized."

287
00:24:13.787 --> 00:24:15.412
You mean "organized"?

288
00:24:15.622 --> 00:24:17.498
Organiz-ized.

289
00:24:17.749 --> 00:24:20.167
Organiz-ized. It's a joke.

290
00:24:21.044 --> 00:24:23.629
O-R-G-A-N-E-Z-I-E-Z-D.

291
00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:28.134
You mean "organiz-ize." Like those
little signs in offices that say, "Thimk."

292
00:24:34.307 --> 00:24:35.724
Do you like where you work?

293
00:24:37.144 --> 00:24:41.063
We've got some good People. And
I think Palantine's got a good chance.

294
00:24:45.193 --> 00:24:47.278
You know you have beautiful eyes?

295
00:24:53.869 --> 00:24:55.953
Do you like the guy you work with?

296
00:24:56.204 --> 00:24:57.788
He's okay.

297
00:24:59.457 --> 00:25:01.041
Yeah, I know.
But do you like him?

298
00:25:01.543 --> 00:25:06.005
He's funny, good at his job. He's okay.
Though he does have a few problems.

299
00:25:06.214 --> 00:25:08.382
I would say
he has quite a few problems.

300
00:25:10.135 --> 00:25:13.179
His energy seems to go
in the wrong Places.

301
00:25:13.805 --> 00:25:16.599
When I walked in and I saw
you two sitting there...

302
00:25:16.808 --> 00:25:19.685
I could just tell
that there was no connection...

303
00:25:19.895 --> 00:25:21.270
whatsoever.

304
00:25:21.521 --> 00:25:24.732
And I felt when I walked in,
there was something between us.

305
00:25:24.983 --> 00:25:27.651
There was an impulse
that we were both following.

306
00:25:27.903 --> 00:25:30.571
So that gave me the right
to talk to you.

307
00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:34.533
Otherwise, I never would've felt
that I had the right to talk to you.

308
00:25:34.784 --> 00:25:37.745
I never would've had
the courage to talk to you.

309
00:25:38.663 --> 00:25:41.123
And with him,
I felt there was nothing.

310
00:25:41.333 --> 00:25:44.418
When I walked in, I knew I was right.
Did you feel that way?

311
00:25:48.006 --> 00:25:50.299
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

312
00:25:52.636 --> 00:25:53.886
Where are you from?

313
00:25:54.471 --> 00:25:55.596
Upstate.

314
00:25:59.684 --> 00:26:01.310
That fellow, I don't like him.

315
00:26:01.519 --> 00:26:04.521
Not that I don't like him,
I just think he's silly.

316
00:26:06.983 --> 00:26:09.235
I don't think he respects you.

317
00:26:10.362 --> 00:26:13.489
I don't believe I've ever met
anyone quite like you.

318
00:26:24.834 --> 00:26:26.543
You wanna go to...

319
00:26:27.879 --> 00:26:29.546
a movie with me?

320
00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:34.051
- I have to go back to work now.
- I don't mean now. Another time?

321
00:26:40.475 --> 00:26:43.018
Sure.
You know what you remind me of?

322
00:26:43.937 --> 00:26:46.355
- What?
- That song...

323
00:26:47.649 --> 00:26:50.609
by Kris Kristofferson.

324
00:26:53.238 --> 00:26:56.198
- Who's that?
- The songwriter.

325
00:26:56.408 --> 00:26:57.950
"He's a prophet...

326
00:26:58.201 --> 00:26:59.910
He's a Prophet and a Pusher...

327
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:04.164
partly truth, Partly fiction,
a walking contradiction."

328
00:27:05.834 --> 00:27:07.251
You saying that about me?

329
00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.169
Who else would I be talking about?

330
00:27:09.754 --> 00:27:11.463
I'm no pusher.
I've never Pushed.

331
00:27:12.924 --> 00:27:15.384
No, just the part
about the contradictions.

332
00:27:15.635 --> 00:27:17.428
You are that.

333
00:27:48.043 --> 00:27:51.837
I called Betsy again at her office.
She said maybe we'd go to a movie...

334
00:27:52.047 --> 00:27:54.965
after work tomorrow.
That's my day off.

335
00:27:55.216 --> 00:27:59.345
At first she hesitated,
but I called her again and she agreed.

336
00:28:00.847 --> 00:28:02.514
Betsy, Betsy. Oh, no.

337
00:28:02.766 --> 00:28:05.434
Betsy what?
I forgot to ask her last name.

338
00:28:05.643 --> 00:28:08.937
Damn! I gotta remember
stuff like that.

339
00:28:20.075 --> 00:28:22.785
Don't worry about anyone
committing themselves...

340
00:28:22.994 --> 00:28:25.662
until things start coming in
from California.

341
00:28:25.914 --> 00:28:28.791
Listen, I think we should've
waited for the limo.

342
00:28:29.042 --> 00:28:30.793
I don't mind the cab,
but I mind...

343
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.797
going to California without the right
preparation. That'll get us in trouble.

344
00:28:34.964 --> 00:28:37.049
Are you Charles Palantine,
the candidate?

345
00:28:38.843 --> 00:28:40.677
Yes, I am.

346
00:28:41.846 --> 00:28:43.305
I'm a big supporter.

347
00:28:43.473 --> 00:28:46.975
I tell everybody that comes in this taxi
they have to vote for you.

348
00:28:47.394 --> 00:28:48.769
Why, thank you...

349
00:28:50.855 --> 00:28:51.897
Travis.

350
00:28:52.065 --> 00:28:55.025
I'm sure you'll win.
Everybody I know's gonna vote for you.

351
00:28:55.235 --> 00:28:57.653
I was gonna put one of
your stickers in my taxi...

352
00:28:57.904 --> 00:29:00.781
but the company said
it was against their policy.

353
00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:02.616
They're a bunch ofjerks.

354
00:29:02.826 --> 00:29:05.661
Let me tell you, I have learned
more about America...

355
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:09.081
from riding in taxicabs than
in all the limos in the country.

356
00:29:10.959 --> 00:29:13.794
- Oh, yeah?
- That's true.

357
00:29:14.295 --> 00:29:16.839
- Can I ask you something, Travis?
- Sure.

358
00:29:17.048 --> 00:29:20.217
What is the one thing about this
country that bugs you the most?

359
00:29:21.928 --> 00:29:26.723
Well, I don't know. I don't follow
political issues that closely, sir.

360
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:29.435
Oh, well, there must be something.

361
00:29:29.727 --> 00:29:33.814
Well, whatever it is, he should
clean up this city here...

362
00:29:34.023 --> 00:29:38.527
because this city here's like an
open sewer. It's full of filth and scum.

363
00:29:38.987 --> 00:29:40.821
Sometimes I can hardly take it.

364
00:29:41.072 --> 00:29:44.032
Whatever ever becomes the president
should just...

365
00:29:44.742 --> 00:29:46.785
really clean it up.
Know what I mean?

366
00:29:47.036 --> 00:29:50.664
Sometimes I go out and I smell it.
I get headaches, it's so bad.

367
00:29:50.874 --> 00:29:53.959
And they just like... They just
never go away, you know?

368
00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:56.545
I think that the President
should just...

369
00:29:57.046 --> 00:30:01.550
clean up this mess. He should
flush it right down the fucking toilet.

370
00:30:09.392 --> 00:30:12.186
Well, I think I know
what you mean, Travis.

371
00:30:12.604 --> 00:30:14.438
But it's not gonna be easy.

372
00:30:14.647 --> 00:30:18.108
- We’ll have to make radical changes.
- Damn straight.

373
00:30:19.652 --> 00:30:21.528
Here you go, Travis.
Keep the change.

374
00:30:21.738 --> 00:30:23.030
Thank you.

375
00:30:26.534 --> 00:30:28.577
- Nice talking to you.
- Nice talking to you.

376
00:30:28.828 --> 00:30:31.163
You're a good man.
I know you're gonna win.

377
00:30:31.539 --> 00:30:33.373
Thank you. Drive safe.

378
00:30:55.939 --> 00:30:58.482
Come on, man.
Get me out of here, all right?

379
00:31:01.903 --> 00:31:03.695
Come on!

380
00:31:04.489 --> 00:31:06.198
Come on, baby.
This is a real drag.

381
00:31:06.449 --> 00:31:09.034
Now, come on!
Come on, don't make no scene.

382
00:31:10.787 --> 00:31:12.120
You wanna get busted?

383
00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:13.622
Now, bitch, be cool!

384
00:31:22.465 --> 00:31:24.591
Don't start no trouble.

385
00:31:25.802 --> 00:31:27.761
Cabbie, forget about this.
It's nothing.

386
00:31:28.012 --> 00:31:29.221
Be cool, bitch!

387
00:31:38.231 --> 00:31:41.483
- Stop!
- Wanna hear something?

388
00:31:47.115 --> 00:31:49.032
What's the matter, baby?

389
00:32:23.484 --> 00:32:25.402
Get your ass out of here!

390
00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:36.848
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

391
00:33:37.725 --> 00:33:40.352
- Have a nice day today?
- Not particularly.

392
00:33:40.561 --> 00:33:42.229
I got a Present for you.

393
00:33:46.484 --> 00:33:50.153
Now back to Gene krupa's
syncopated style shortly.

394
00:33:58.287 --> 00:33:59.538
Why'd you do that?

395
00:33:59.747 --> 00:34:02.666
What else am I gonna do
with my money?

396
00:34:03.042 --> 00:34:05.168
I wish you'd have listened to this.

397
00:34:05.753 --> 00:34:08.755
I would have, except my record
player doesn't work now.

398
00:34:09.006 --> 00:34:10.215
Your stereo's broken?

399
00:34:10.466 --> 00:34:12.884
How can you stand it?
I can't live without music.

400
00:34:13.136 --> 00:34:16.763
I don't follow music too much,
but I would really like to.

401
00:34:17.014 --> 00:34:18.890
Then you haven't played
this record yet?

402
00:34:19.058 --> 00:34:20.559
No.

403
00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:26.064
But I was thinking maybe we could
listen to it on your record player.

404
00:34:26.315 --> 00:34:29.985
Now, going back to
40 years of Chick Webb.

405
00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:47.753
You gotta be kidding.

406
00:34:47.962 --> 00:34:51.256
- What?
- This is a dirty movie.

407
00:34:51.841 --> 00:34:55.677
No, no. This is a movie
that a lot of couples come to.

408
00:34:55.887 --> 00:34:59.806
- All kinds of couples go here.
- You sure about that?

409
00:35:00.516 --> 00:35:02.726
Yeah, I see them all the time.

410
00:35:06.022 --> 00:35:07.105
Come on.

411
00:35:47.939 --> 00:35:49.314
Shut the fuck up.

412
00:35:49.565 --> 00:35:51.775
- Where are you going?
- I have to leave now.

413
00:35:52.026 --> 00:35:54.277
- Why?
- I don't know why I came in here.

414
00:35:54.529 --> 00:35:56.780
- I don't like these movies.
- Well, I mean...

415
00:35:57.031 --> 00:35:59.908
I didn't know you'd feel
that way about this movie.

416
00:36:00.159 --> 00:36:03.036
- If I had known...
- These the only movies you go to?

417
00:36:03.287 --> 00:36:06.248
Yeah, I mean I come and...
This is not so bad.

418
00:36:06.415 --> 00:36:10.293
Taking me to a place like this is as
exciting to me as saying, "Let's fuck."

419
00:36:14.757 --> 00:36:17.300
There are other places
I can take you.

420
00:36:17.468 --> 00:36:20.637
I don't know much about them,
but I can take you other Places.

421
00:36:21.097 --> 00:36:22.639
We're just different.

422
00:36:23.182 --> 00:36:25.433
- Wait a second.
- I have to go.

423
00:36:25.643 --> 00:36:26.852
- I've gotta go now.
- Wait.

424
00:36:27.061 --> 00:36:30.689
- Wait a second, I wanna talk to you.
- Look, I have to go.

425
00:36:31.315 --> 00:36:32.399
Taxi!

426
00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:36.778
Can I talk to you at least? Won't you at
least talk to me? I didn't know you'd...

427
00:36:36.946 --> 00:36:38.321
Won't you take the record?

428
00:36:38.531 --> 00:36:40.866
- I've already got it.
- But, please.

429
00:36:41.117 --> 00:36:45.078
- I bought it for you, Betsy.
- Now I've got two. Let's go.

430
00:36:45.288 --> 00:36:46.997
Can I call you?

431
00:36:48.207 --> 00:36:50.333
Jesus Christ, I got a taxi.

432
00:36:56.257 --> 00:36:57.799
Hello, Betsy.

433
00:36:58.009 --> 00:36:59.718
Hi, it's Travis.

434
00:37:01.596 --> 00:37:04.556
How you doing? Listen,
I'm sorry about the other night.

435
00:37:04.807 --> 00:37:07.851
I didn't know that was
the way you felt about it.

436
00:37:09.729 --> 00:37:14.733
Well, I didn't know. If I... I would
have taken you somewhere else.

437
00:37:15.985 --> 00:37:18.069
Are you feeling better or...?

438
00:37:18.988 --> 00:37:22.657
Maybe you had a virus or something.
A 24-hour virus, you know.

439
00:37:22.909 --> 00:37:25.160
It can happen. Yeah.

440
00:37:29.916 --> 00:37:32.459
You've been working hard, huh?
Yeah.

441
00:37:36.505 --> 00:37:39.799
Would you like to have
some dinner with me...

442
00:37:40.051 --> 00:37:42.677
in the next few days or something?

443
00:37:45.681 --> 00:37:47.307
How about just a cup of coffee?

444
00:37:47.558 --> 00:37:51.645
I could come by the headquarters
or something, and we could...

445
00:37:52.521 --> 00:37:54.356
Okay, okay.

446
00:37:56.943 --> 00:37:59.569
Did you get my flowers in the...?

447
00:38:01.489 --> 00:38:05.825
You didn't get them?
But I sent some flowers.

448
00:38:09.538 --> 00:38:12.123
Yeah. Well... Okay, okay.

449
00:38:12.291 --> 00:38:14.376
Can I call you again?

450
00:38:14.794 --> 00:38:17.337
Tomorrow or the next day?
Okay.

451
00:38:17.505 --> 00:38:20.423
No, I'm gonna...
Okay, yeah, sure. Okay.

452
00:38:20.716 --> 00:38:22.092
So long.

453
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:26.346
I tried several times to call her...

454
00:38:26.514 --> 00:38:30.433
but after the first call, she wouldn't
come to the phone any longer.

455
00:38:30.893 --> 00:38:33.269
I also sent flowers,
but with no luck.

456
00:38:33.604 --> 00:38:36.106
The smell of the flowers
only made me sicker.

457
00:38:36.357 --> 00:38:40.860
The headaches got worse.
I think I got stomach cancer.

458
00:38:41.487 --> 00:38:43.571
I shouldn't complain, though.

459
00:38:44.073 --> 00:38:46.074
You're only as healthy...

460
00:38:46.951 --> 00:38:49.411
You're only as healthy as you feel.

461
00:38:50.746 --> 00:38:52.122
You're only...

462
00:38:52.373 --> 00:38:54.040
as healthy...

463
00:38:54.291 --> 00:38:55.667
as...

464
00:38:55.918 --> 00:38:57.460
you...

465
00:38:57.712 --> 00:38:59.045
feel.

466
00:39:09.432 --> 00:39:13.018
- Let's not have any trouble, okay?
- Why won't you talk to me?

467
00:39:13.227 --> 00:39:15.687
You think I don't know you're here?

468
00:39:15.938 --> 00:39:17.939
You think I don't know?

469
00:39:18.149 --> 00:39:19.816
- Please leave.
- Take your hands off!

470
00:39:20.026 --> 00:39:22.193
I just want you to know...

471
00:39:22.403 --> 00:39:24.863
Please, just leave.
This is no place to do this.

472
00:39:25.031 --> 00:39:26.156
Take your hands off me.

473
00:39:26.323 --> 00:39:28.033
- Take your hands off!
- Just leave.

474
00:39:28.284 --> 00:39:31.369
- All right, just leave, then.
- I'm gonna tell you...

475
00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:34.205
you're in a hell!
You'll die in hell like the rest.

476
00:39:34.415 --> 00:39:37.167
- Come on. There's a cop.
- You're like the rest of them.

477
00:39:37.418 --> 00:39:39.711
Look, I'm calling the cop.
Officer!

478
00:39:42.673 --> 00:39:44.090
Officer!

479
00:39:45.718 --> 00:39:49.054
Look, don't come around here,
because I'll call the Police!

480
00:39:49.972 --> 00:39:54.976
I realize now how much she's just
like the others, cold and distant.

481
00:39:55.186 --> 00:39:56.853
And many people are like that.

482
00:39:57.063 --> 00:40:00.356
Women for sure.
They're like a union.

483
00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:03.109
Yo, cab!

484
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:14.788
Okay, pull over to the curb over there.
Right over to the curb. Over there.

485
00:40:16.791 --> 00:40:18.875
No, no, don't... Don't... Don't...

486
00:40:19.043 --> 00:40:21.461
The fucking meter.
What are you doing?

487
00:40:21.962 --> 00:40:23.838
What are you doing with the meter?

488
00:40:24.048 --> 00:40:27.217
Did I tell you to Put...?
Did I tell you to do that with the meter?

489
00:40:27.426 --> 00:40:29.469
Put the meter back.
Let the numbers go on.

490
00:40:29.637 --> 00:40:31.346
I don't care what I have to Pay.

491
00:40:31.555 --> 00:40:35.183
I'm not getting out.
Put the meter back on.

492
00:40:35.351 --> 00:40:36.392
Put it down.

493
00:40:37.603 --> 00:40:40.772
Put it... That's right.
Put it... Put it down!

494
00:40:42.525 --> 00:40:43.900
That's right.

495
00:40:44.777 --> 00:40:47.278
Why are you writing?
Don't write!

496
00:40:47.488 --> 00:40:48.988
Put the thing down. Just sit.

497
00:40:52.493 --> 00:40:55.578
I didn't tell you to write.
I just said, "Pull over."

498
00:40:55.871 --> 00:40:58.289
We Pulled over to the curb.
We're gonna sit here.

499
00:41:00.084 --> 00:41:01.876
We're gonna sit.

500
00:41:20.563 --> 00:41:24.566
Cabbie, you see that light up there?
The window?

501
00:41:26.026 --> 00:41:28.403
The light?
The window in the second floor.

502
00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:34.993
The one that's closest
to the edge of the building.

503
00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:39.581
The light up in the window.
Second story.

504
00:41:41.083 --> 00:41:42.959
What are you, blind?

505
00:41:43.169 --> 00:41:44.794
Do you see the light?

506
00:41:45.462 --> 00:41:48.548
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you see it. Good.

507
00:41:50.718 --> 00:41:51.843
You see the woman?

508
00:41:54.471 --> 00:41:57.182
Do you see the woman in the window?

509
00:41:59.226 --> 00:42:02.353
- Yeah.
- You see the woman. Good.

510
00:42:02.521 --> 00:42:05.440
I want you to see that woman
because that's my wife.

511
00:42:07.985 --> 00:42:09.819
But that's not my apartment.

512
00:42:12.573 --> 00:42:15.450
It's not my apartment.
You know who lives there, huh?

513
00:42:16.452 --> 00:42:20.038
No, I mean, you wouldn't know.
But you know who lives there?

514
00:42:21.373 --> 00:42:22.957
A nigger lives there.

515
00:42:23.167 --> 00:42:25.043
How do you like that?

516
00:42:32.218 --> 00:42:34.219
And I'm g... I'm gonna kill her.

517
00:42:36.347 --> 00:42:39.307
There's nothing else.
I'm gonna kill her.

518
00:42:39.516 --> 00:42:41.517
Well, what do you think of that?

519
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:45.480
I said, what do you think of that?

520
00:42:45.981 --> 00:42:47.398
Don't answer.

521
00:42:47.775 --> 00:42:49.859
You don't have to answer everything.

522
00:42:53.989 --> 00:42:56.783
I'm gonna kill her
with a .44 Magnum Pistol.

523
00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:01.537
I have a .44 Magnum pistol.
I'm gonna kill her with that gun.

524
00:43:02.039 --> 00:43:05.541
Did you ever see what a .44 Magnum
pistol can do to a woman's face?

525
00:43:05.709 --> 00:43:09.671
I mean, it'd fucking destroy it.
Just blow it right apart.

526
00:43:09.922 --> 00:43:12.173
That's what it can do to her face.

527
00:43:12.508 --> 00:43:15.635
Did you ever see what it can do to
a woman's pussy? You should.

528
00:43:17.054 --> 00:43:20.723
You should see what a .44 Magnum's
gonna do to a woman's Pussy.

529
00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:29.023
What's that?

530
00:43:29.275 --> 00:43:32.193
I know you must think
that I'm, you know...

531
00:43:32.403 --> 00:43:36.155
You must think
I'm pretty sick or something.

532
00:43:37.032 --> 00:43:39.534
Right? You must think
I'm pretty sick?

533
00:43:43.539 --> 00:43:47.208
Right? I bet you really
think I'm sick, right?

534
00:43:54.174 --> 00:43:55.758
You think I'm sick?

535
00:43:58.846 --> 00:44:02.473
You don't have to answer.
I'm paying for the ride.

536
00:44:04.268 --> 00:44:06.394
I picked up this midget, you know.

537
00:44:06.645 --> 00:44:09.147
He's very well-dressed,
Italian suit...

538
00:44:09.398 --> 00:44:11.816
good-looking,
with a beautiful tall blonde.

539
00:44:12.067 --> 00:44:14.569
- Was it a lady midget?
- No, the guy was a midget.

540
00:44:14.778 --> 00:44:17.071
- The blonde was a lady.
- I got you.

541
00:44:17.323 --> 00:44:19.324
Those midgets are funny.

542
00:44:20.576 --> 00:44:22.660
Sometimes I like to hold a midget.

543
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:25.663
They're funny. They always
wanna sit in the front seat.

544
00:44:27.374 --> 00:44:31.169
Then I Pick up these two fags.
They're going downtown.

545
00:44:33.297 --> 00:44:37.508
They're wearing rhinestone T-shirts.
They start arguing and yelling.

546
00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:40.720
The other one says, "You bitch,"
and starts beating him.

547
00:44:40.929 --> 00:44:43.431
I say, "I don't care
what you do in the privacy...

548
00:44:43.682 --> 00:44:46.017
of your own home,
behind closed doors.

549
00:44:46.226 --> 00:44:47.935
This is an American free country.

550
00:44:48.187 --> 00:44:52.732
We got a pursuit of happiness thing.
You're consenting, you're adult.

551
00:44:52.983 --> 00:44:57.528
But, you know, in my fucking cab,
don't go busting heads.

552
00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:00.948
- God loves you, do what you want."
- Tell them to go to California.

553
00:45:01.158 --> 00:45:05.828
In California, when two fags split up,
one's gotta pay the other one alimony.

554
00:45:07.206 --> 00:45:12.043
Not bad. They're way ahead
out there, you know? California.

555
00:45:12.252 --> 00:45:14.170
So I tell them to get out of the cab.

556
00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:17.006
One time, I saw a cop chase
this guy with one leg.

557
00:45:17.257 --> 00:45:20.343
- He was on crutches, you know.
- The cop?

558
00:45:20.552 --> 00:45:23.846
No, the dude he was chasing.
Fucking cops, they chase anything.

559
00:45:24.014 --> 00:45:27.517
- Hey, Travis.
- Hey, you got that 5 you owe me?

560
00:45:29.228 --> 00:45:32.939
My man is loaded. Loaded.

561
00:45:33.524 --> 00:45:37.819
I'd be broke if I hadn't caught me
some People from Ohio out at Kennedy.

562
00:45:38.028 --> 00:45:42.156
I took them into Manhattan by way
of Long beach, tipped me $5.

563
00:45:42.408 --> 00:45:44.409
What's the action around?

564
00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:46.202
It's Pretty slow.

565
00:45:47.496 --> 00:45:48.788
I'm shoving on.

566
00:45:49.873 --> 00:45:51.332
Hey, Wiz, wait.

567
00:45:52.209 --> 00:45:55.586
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Bye, killer.

568
00:45:58.715 --> 00:46:00.716
Thank you. Night.

569
00:46:15.607 --> 00:46:18.109
- You Put it down.
- You can have them all you want!

570
00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.695
Hey, don't be hitting my man!

571
00:46:22.448 --> 00:46:24.991
You better take your ass out, boy!

572
00:46:29.913 --> 00:46:30.955
Yeah?

573
00:46:31.123 --> 00:46:33.624
I know you and I ain't talked
too much, you know.

574
00:46:33.792 --> 00:46:36.711
But I figure you've been around a lot,
so you could...

575
00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:39.422
Shoot, that's why
they call me the Wizard.

576
00:46:39.631 --> 00:46:40.923
I got...

577
00:46:41.717 --> 00:46:45.636
It's just that I got a... I got a...

578
00:46:45.804 --> 00:46:47.096
Things got you down?

579
00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:50.349
Yeah, happens to the best of them.

580
00:46:51.435 --> 00:46:54.061
Yeah, they got me real down.
Real...

581
00:46:59.735 --> 00:47:01.152
I just wanna go out...

582
00:47:01.361 --> 00:47:05.531
and you know, like, really...
Really... Really do something.

583
00:47:07.576 --> 00:47:09.494
Taxi life, you mean?

584
00:47:10.746 --> 00:47:13.039
Yeah, well...

585
00:47:13.332 --> 00:47:15.124
No, it's...

586
00:47:16.376 --> 00:47:17.627
I don't know.

587
00:47:19.963 --> 00:47:22.006
I just wanna go out...

588
00:47:22.591 --> 00:47:24.675
I really...

589
00:47:25.594 --> 00:47:27.261
I really wanna...

590
00:47:27.596 --> 00:47:30.556
I got some bad ideas in my head.
I just...

591
00:47:32.601 --> 00:47:34.810
Look. Look at it this way.

592
00:47:35.938 --> 00:47:39.941
A man...
A man takes a job, you know.

593
00:47:40.442 --> 00:47:42.068
And that job...

594
00:47:44.196 --> 00:47:46.614
you know, that becomes what he is.

595
00:47:46.907 --> 00:47:48.699
You know, like...

596
00:47:50.285 --> 00:47:52.870
You do a thing,
and that's what you are.

597
00:47:54.164 --> 00:47:57.917
I've been a cabbie for 1 7 years.
Ten years at night.

598
00:47:58.168 --> 00:48:01.003
And I still don't own my own cab,
you know. Why?

599
00:48:01.797 --> 00:48:05.967
Because I don't want to.
That must be what I want.

600
00:48:06.176 --> 00:48:09.345
You know, to be on the night shift,
driving somebody else's cab.

601
00:48:09.555 --> 00:48:11.222
You understand?

602
00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:15.226
You get a job, you become the job.

603
00:48:15.435 --> 00:48:18.980
One guy lives in Brooklyn,
one guy lives in Sutton Place.

604
00:48:19.189 --> 00:48:21.691
You get a lawyer,
another guy's a doctor.

605
00:48:21.942 --> 00:48:25.027
Another guy dies,
another guy gets well...

606
00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.029
and people are born.

607
00:48:27.239 --> 00:48:29.365
I envy you, your youth.

608
00:48:30.492 --> 00:48:33.995
Go out and get laid.
Get drunk. You know, do anything.

609
00:48:36.623 --> 00:48:39.625
You got no choice, anyway.
I mean, we're all fucked.

610
00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:43.546
More or less, you know?

611
00:48:47.467 --> 00:48:51.470
I don't know. That's about
the dumbest thing I ever heard.

612
00:48:53.098 --> 00:48:56.309
It's not Bertrand Russell,
but what do you want? I'm a cabbie.

613
00:48:56.476 --> 00:48:57.768
What do I know?

614
00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:00.855
I don't even know what the fuck
you're talking about.

615
00:49:01.064 --> 00:49:03.357
Maybe I don't know either.

616
00:49:04.568 --> 00:49:09.238
Don't worry so much. Relax,
killer, you're gonna be all right.

617
00:49:09.489 --> 00:49:12.366
I know.
I've seen a lot of people...

618
00:49:12.951 --> 00:49:15.745
- and I know.
- Okay.

619
00:49:15.912 --> 00:49:17.330
Okay. Thanks, man.

620
00:49:17.497 --> 00:49:20.875
I'll see you. I guess...

621
00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:26.297
Yeah, you know. You're all right.
You're all right.

622
00:49:44.316 --> 00:49:48.778
What do you think of your opponent's
chances in the upcoming primary?

623
00:49:48.987 --> 00:49:50.571
Mr. Goodman is a fine man.

624
00:49:50.781 --> 00:49:54.116
I would certainly,
if it came to it, prefer him...

625
00:49:54.451 --> 00:49:56.911
to our opponent
in the other party.

626
00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:00.748
I think that my programs
are better defined than his.

627
00:50:00.999 --> 00:50:04.669
They're more imaginative.
I have a better chance of winning.

628
00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:07.713
It's academic, though. He's not
gonna win the primary. I am.

629
00:50:07.964 --> 00:50:09.674
I see.

630
00:50:10.425 --> 00:50:13.260
Well, one more thing
I'd like to ask you.

631
00:50:13.512 --> 00:50:15.721
How do you feel
your campaign is going?

632
00:50:15.972 --> 00:50:19.100
When we came up with our slogan
"We are the people"...

633
00:50:19.351 --> 00:50:21.602
when I said
"Let the people rule"...

634
00:50:22.145 --> 00:50:24.689
I felt I was being
somewhat overly optimistic.

635
00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:28.484
I must tell you that I am more
optimistic now than ever before.

636
00:50:28.735 --> 00:50:32.613
The people are rising to the demands
that I have made on them.

637
00:50:32.823 --> 00:50:35.282
The people are beginning to rule.

638
00:50:35.492 --> 00:50:38.119
I feel it is a groundswell.
I know...

639
00:50:38.328 --> 00:50:41.288
it will continue
through the primary and in Miami.

640
00:50:41.456 --> 00:50:44.250
And I know it will rise...

641
00:50:44.459 --> 00:50:47.169
to an unprecedented swell
in November.

642
00:52:13.423 --> 00:52:15.674
That bitch, goddamn!
I'll blow her brains out!

643
00:52:15.884 --> 00:52:20.054
I'll kill her, goddamn it! I'm gonna
get my hands on her, I'll kill her!

644
00:52:20.263 --> 00:52:21.555
Shoot, goddamn it! Fucker!

645
00:52:21.723 --> 00:52:25.476
I swear if I get my hands on her,
I'll kill that fucking bitch!

646
00:52:27.312 --> 00:52:28.771
- Hey, sport.
- Hey, sport.

647
00:52:28.939 --> 00:52:31.148
I'll kill her! Damn it!

648
00:52:31.316 --> 00:52:34.401
- That guy keeps following us.
- Don't look at him.

649
00:52:50.627 --> 00:52:52.127
Hey, guys.

650
00:52:54.965 --> 00:52:57.633
- You wanna take a walk?
- Yeah.

651
00:53:09.729 --> 00:53:13.315
Loneliness has followed me
my whole life, everywhere.

652
00:53:13.692 --> 00:53:16.110
In bars, in cars...

653
00:53:16.486 --> 00:53:18.988
sidewalks, stores, everywhere.

654
00:53:20.115 --> 00:53:21.532
There's no escape.

655
00:53:21.992 --> 00:53:24.451
I'm God's lonely man.

656
00:53:28.498 --> 00:53:30.124
June 8th.

657
00:53:30.625 --> 00:53:33.043
My life has taken another turn again.

658
00:53:33.295 --> 00:53:36.755
The days move along
with regularity, over and over...

659
00:53:36.965 --> 00:53:39.508
one day indistinguishable
from the next.

660
00:53:39.759 --> 00:53:42.219
A long, continuous chain.

661
00:53:42.429 --> 00:53:44.263
And then suddenly...

662
00:53:44.514 --> 00:53:46.557
there is change.

663
00:54:01.156 --> 00:54:04.074
Travis, this here's Easy Andy.
He's a traveling salesman.

664
00:54:04.284 --> 00:54:06.368
How you doing, Travis?

665
00:54:29.059 --> 00:54:31.810
- You got a .44 Magnum?
- It's an expensive weapon.

666
00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:34.063
That's all right. I got money.

667
00:54:34.272 --> 00:54:35.981
It's a real monster.

668
00:54:37.025 --> 00:54:40.778
Stop a car at 1 00 yards, Put a round
right through the engine block.

669
00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:53.499
Here you go.

670
00:54:53.959 --> 00:54:56.543
It's a premium, high-resale weapon.

671
00:55:00.924 --> 00:55:02.257
Look at that.

672
00:55:03.885 --> 00:55:05.594
Look at that. That's a beauty.

673
00:55:10.392 --> 00:55:13.811
I could sell this gun to some
jungle bunny in Harlem for $500.

674
00:55:14.771 --> 00:55:18.107
But I just deal high-quality goods
to the right people.

675
00:55:19.317 --> 00:55:20.609
How about that?

676
00:55:21.403 --> 00:55:23.988
This might be a little too big
for Practical purposes.

677
00:55:24.322 --> 00:55:26.448
In which case,
for you, I'd recommend...

678
00:55:27.575 --> 00:55:28.659
38 snub-nosed.

679
00:55:30.745 --> 00:55:32.079
Look at this.

680
00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:36.750
Look at that.
That's a beautiful little gun.

681
00:55:36.918 --> 00:55:39.169
It's nickel-Plated with a snub-nose...

682
00:55:39.337 --> 00:55:41.797
otherwise the same
as a service revolver.

683
00:55:42.048 --> 00:55:44.258
That'll stop anything that moves.

684
00:55:44.426 --> 00:55:47.845
The Magnum, they use that
in Africa for killing elephants.

685
00:55:48.013 --> 00:55:51.265
That .38, that's a funny gun.

686
00:55:56.354 --> 00:55:58.605
Some of these guns are like toys.

687
00:55:58.815 --> 00:56:01.942
That .38, you go out and
hammer nails with it all day...

688
00:56:02.152 --> 00:56:05.446
come back and it'll cut
dead center on target every time.

689
00:56:05.864 --> 00:56:09.616
It's got a really nice action to it
and a heck of a wallop.

690
00:56:12.287 --> 00:56:14.038
You interested in an automatic?

691
00:56:14.706 --> 00:56:18.375
It's a Colt .25 automatic.
It's a nice little gun.

692
00:56:18.585 --> 00:56:19.793
It's a beautiful gun.

693
00:56:20.003 --> 00:56:22.588
Holds six shots in the clip,
one shot in the chamber.

694
00:56:22.797 --> 00:56:24.882
If you're dumb enough
to Put a round there.

695
00:56:26.384 --> 00:56:28.802
Here. Look at this.

696
00:56:29.012 --> 00:56:30.512
.380 Walther.

697
00:56:30.805 --> 00:56:32.973
Holds eight shots in the clip.

698
00:56:34.059 --> 00:56:36.101
That's a nice gun.

699
00:56:36.352 --> 00:56:38.812
That's a beautiful little gun.
Look at that.

700
00:56:42.233 --> 00:56:46.528
During World War II, they used
this gun to replace the P 38.

701
00:56:47.322 --> 00:56:49.573
Just given out to officers.

702
00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:57.372
Ain't that a little honey?

703
00:57:06.382 --> 00:57:09.134
- How much for everything?
- All together?

704
00:57:09.344 --> 00:57:13.430
Well, only a jackass would carry
that cannon in the streets like that.

705
00:57:14.516 --> 00:57:18.018
Here's a beautiful handmade holster
I had made in Mexico.

706
00:57:18.269 --> 00:57:20.104
Forty dollars.

707
00:57:20.855 --> 00:57:23.857
Three-fifty for the Magnum,
250 for the .38...

708
00:57:24.025 --> 00:57:27.653
one and a quarter for the .25,
1 50 for the .380.

709
00:57:28.029 --> 00:57:31.073
You take this and wait here.
I'll walk down with you.

710
00:57:31.991 --> 00:57:34.952
How about dope? Grass?
Hash? Coke?

711
00:57:35.161 --> 00:57:39.123
Mescaline? Downers? Nembutal?
Tuinal? Chloral hydrates?

712
00:57:39.374 --> 00:57:42.876
- How about uppers, amphetamines?
- No, I'm not interested in that stuff.

713
00:57:43.086 --> 00:57:45.754
I can get you crystal meth,
nitrous oxide.

714
00:57:46.005 --> 00:57:48.382
How about a Cadillac?
A brand-new Cadillac...

715
00:57:48.716 --> 00:57:50.425
with the pink slip, two grand.

716
00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:00.561
June 29th.

717
00:58:01.396 --> 00:58:04.523
I gotta get in shape now.
Too much sitting has ruined my body.

718
00:58:04.691 --> 00:58:07.276
Too much abuse has gone on
for too long.

719
00:58:07.527 --> 00:58:09.945
From now on, it'll be
50 pushups each morning.

720
00:58:10.405 --> 00:58:13.282
Fifty pull-ups.
There will be no more pills.

721
00:58:13.533 --> 00:58:17.661
There will be no more bad food,
no more destroyers of my body.

722
00:58:18.246 --> 00:58:21.957
From now on, it'll be total organization.
Every muscle must be tight.

723
00:58:39.017 --> 00:58:44.062
Look at the size of that.
Uh, yeah. Uh, yeah.

724
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:46.440
Uh, it looks so good.

725
00:58:51.821 --> 00:58:56.241
It's getting harder and harder,
and it's throbbing now.

726
00:58:57.785 --> 00:59:01.788
The idea had been growing
in my brain for some time.

727
00:59:02.665 --> 00:59:04.124
True force.

728
00:59:04.334 --> 00:59:08.962
All the king's men cannot
put it back together again.

729
01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:13.420
- Where do we get more of these?
- Where do you think? At headquarters.

730
01:01:13.629 --> 01:01:15.797
All the way back there?

731
01:01:16.007 --> 01:01:17.215
- Come on.
- They’ll work.

732
01:01:17.467 --> 01:01:20.135
- Maybe it's the speakers.
- I've done this 1 00 times.

733
01:01:20.386 --> 01:01:22.637
- You've done this before?
- Yes, don't worry.

734
01:01:22.889 --> 01:01:25.766
- When was the last time?
- I've never done this before.

735
01:01:25.975 --> 01:01:27.476
Betsy!

736
01:01:27.852 --> 01:01:29.895
- Betsy!
- What?!

737
01:01:30.605 --> 01:01:33.648
Betsy. Come here, come here.

738
01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:29.538
Hey.

739
01:02:31.666 --> 01:02:34.334
Hey, you're a Secret Service man,
aren't you?

740
01:02:36.504 --> 01:02:38.505
Just waiting for the senator.

741
01:02:39.382 --> 01:02:41.675
You're waiting for the senator?

742
01:02:45.471 --> 01:02:47.722
That's a very good answer.

743
01:02:47.974 --> 01:02:50.183
Shit, man.

744
01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:54.771
I'm waiting for the sun to shine.
Yeah.

745
01:02:55.231 --> 01:02:58.942
No, the reason I asked
if you were a Secret Service man...

746
01:02:59.193 --> 01:03:00.735
I won't say anything.

747
01:03:00.987 --> 01:03:02.487
Is because I...

748
01:03:06.451 --> 01:03:08.785
I saw some suspicious-looking
people over there.

749
01:03:09.036 --> 01:03:11.204
- You did?
- They were right over there.

750
01:03:16.711 --> 01:03:18.962
They were just here.

751
01:03:22.341 --> 01:03:24.468
They were very, very...

752
01:03:24.719 --> 01:03:27.053
- Suspicious.
- Yeah.

753
01:03:29.765 --> 01:03:32.058
Where'd he go?

754
01:03:32.310 --> 01:03:35.061
Is it hard to get to be in
the Secret Service?

755
01:03:35.229 --> 01:03:36.313
Why?

756
01:03:36.481 --> 01:03:39.441
Well, I was just curious,
because I think I'd be good at it.

757
01:03:39.734 --> 01:03:41.485
I'm very observant.

758
01:03:41.736 --> 01:03:44.404
I was in the Marine Corps, you know.

759
01:03:44.739 --> 01:03:46.740
I'm good with crowds.

760
01:03:49.076 --> 01:03:52.579
I noticed your little pin there.
That's like a signal, isn't it?

761
01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:53.872
Sort of.

762
01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:58.168
A signal. A secret signal
for a Secret Service.

763
01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:03.590
Hey, what kind of guns
you guys carry?

764
01:04:03.841 --> 01:04:08.845
.38s? .45s? .357 Magnums?
Something bigger, maybe?

765
01:04:09.096 --> 01:04:13.808
Look, if you're really interested, if
you give me your name and address...

766
01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:17.562
we'll send you all the information
on how to apply. How's that?

767
01:04:20.149 --> 01:04:21.233
- You will?
- Sure.

768
01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:22.943
Okay.

769
01:04:23.402 --> 01:04:24.861
Why not?

770
01:04:28.449 --> 01:04:30.283
My name is Henry...

771
01:04:31.827 --> 01:04:34.663
Krinkle. K-R-I-N-k-L-E.

772
01:04:37.875 --> 01:04:41.962
1 54 Hopper Avenue.

773
01:04:42.213 --> 01:04:44.297
- "Hopper"?
- Yeah.

774
01:04:46.551 --> 01:04:49.302
You know, like a rabbit? Hip, hop.

775
01:04:52.306 --> 01:04:54.307
Fair Lawn, New Jersey.

776
01:04:57.061 --> 01:04:58.144
Is there a zip code?

777
01:04:58.396 --> 01:05:01.356
Yeah, 6-1-0-4-5-2.

778
01:05:03.609 --> 01:05:07.362
- Okay?
- That's six digits. 6, 1...

779
01:05:08.489 --> 01:05:11.533
Oh, well, 6-1 -0-4-5.

780
01:05:12.034 --> 01:05:13.827
Okay.

781
01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:17.122
I was thinking of
my telephone number.

782
01:05:17.373 --> 01:05:18.456
Well, I've got it all.

783
01:05:18.666 --> 01:05:21.418
Henry, we'll get all the stuff
right out to you.

784
01:05:21.669 --> 01:05:25.130
Thanks a lot. Hey, great.
Thanks a lot. Hell. Jesus.

785
01:05:25.339 --> 01:05:27.173
- Be careful today.
- Right. Will do.

786
01:05:27.383 --> 01:05:31.595
You have to be careful around
a Place like this. Bye.

787
01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.229
Damn it!

788
01:06:03.210 --> 01:06:05.003
Yeah.

789
01:06:09.008 --> 01:06:12.260
I'm faster than you,
you fucking sick...

790
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:15.180
I saw you coming, you fuck.

791
01:06:15.389 --> 01:06:17.057
Shitheel!

792
01:06:20.478 --> 01:06:23.396
I'm standing here.
You make the move.

793
01:06:23.606 --> 01:06:25.273
You make the move.

794
01:06:25.691 --> 01:06:27.400
It's your move.

795
01:06:30.446 --> 01:06:32.656
Don't try it, you fuck.

796
01:06:39.205 --> 01:06:47.205
You talking to me?

797
01:06:51.175 --> 01:06:54.552
Well, then who the hell else are you
talking to? You talking to me?

798
01:06:55.054 --> 01:06:57.055
Well, I'm the only one here.

799
01:06:58.808 --> 01:07:02.268
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

800
01:07:02.561 --> 01:07:04.145
Oh, yeah?

801
01:07:06.148 --> 01:07:07.941
Okay.

802
01:07:15.241 --> 01:07:17.617
Listen, you fuckers,
you screwheads.

803
01:07:17.827 --> 01:07:20.370
Here is a man who would not
take it anymore.

804
01:07:20.621 --> 01:07:22.747
Who would not let...

805
01:07:22.998 --> 01:07:25.834
Listen, you fuckers,
you screwheads.

806
01:07:26.085 --> 01:07:29.504
Here is a man who would not
take it anymore.

807
01:07:29.755 --> 01:07:31.798
A man who stood up
against the scum...

808
01:07:32.007 --> 01:07:34.384
the cunts, the dogs,
the filth, the shit.

809
01:07:34.552 --> 01:07:37.637
Here is someone who stood up.

810
01:07:44.478 --> 01:07:45.979
You're dead.

811
01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:14.215
Hey, Travis.

812
01:08:14.842 --> 01:08:16.092
Hi, Melio.

813
01:08:27.313 --> 01:08:28.438
Yeah, man?

814
01:08:28.689 --> 01:08:32.776
Okay, shut your fucking mouth and give
me the cash out the drawer. Come on!

815
01:08:33.027 --> 01:08:35.820
- Let's go. Give me the damn cash.
- Don't shoot.

816
01:08:36.030 --> 01:08:38.239
Stop taking so long. Come on!

817
01:08:38.449 --> 01:08:40.909
Let me have it. Give me the bread.

818
01:08:41.118 --> 01:08:42.702
- This all you got?
- That's it.

819
01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:45.205
I don't have any more money, man.

820
01:08:45.414 --> 01:08:47.207
- That's all I got!
- You got more.

821
01:08:47.458 --> 01:08:50.460
- I tell you, I got no money!
- Reach in your sock.

822
01:08:50.628 --> 01:08:52.629
- Give me the rest of the bread.
- Hey. Hey.

823
01:08:58.177 --> 01:09:00.595
- Did you get him?
- Yeah, I got him.

824
01:09:05.309 --> 01:09:07.560
Shit, man.

825
01:09:09.563 --> 01:09:12.315
- Is he dead?
- I don't know. His eyes are moving.

826
01:09:18.405 --> 01:09:21.825
I ain't got a Permit for this thing.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

827
01:09:26.747 --> 01:09:28.331
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

828
01:09:28.541 --> 01:09:31.417
- Can I give you some money?
- No, man, just get out of here.

829
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:34.170
No, man. I'll take care of it.
Go ahead.

830
01:09:37.925 --> 01:09:40.844
The fifth motherfucker this year!

831
01:11:26.533 --> 01:11:29.118
Walt Whitman, that great
American poet...

832
01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:31.371
spoke for all of us when he said:

833
01:11:31.664 --> 01:11:34.374
"I am the man. I suffered.

834
01:11:34.541 --> 01:11:37.752
I was there."
Today I say to you:

835
01:11:38.003 --> 01:11:41.381
We are the people. We suffered.

836
01:11:41.632 --> 01:11:43.883
We were there.

837
01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:49.389
We, the people,
suffered in Vietnam.

838
01:11:49.974 --> 01:11:52.725
We, the people, suffered.
We still suffer...

839
01:11:52.977 --> 01:11:55.728
from unemployment, inflation...

840
01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:57.981
crime and corruption.

841
01:12:01.402 --> 01:12:03.194
Dear Father and Mother...

842
01:12:03.404 --> 01:12:05.738
July is the month I remember...

843
01:12:05.906 --> 01:12:09.158
which brings not only
your wedding anniversary...

844
01:12:09.368 --> 01:12:12.578
but also Father's Day
and Mother's birthday.

845
01:12:12.788 --> 01:12:15.707
I'm sorry I can't remember
the exact dates...

846
01:12:15.916 --> 01:12:19.919
but I hope this card
will take care of them all.

847
01:12:20.212 --> 01:12:23.339
I'm sorry, again, I cannot
send you my address...

848
01:12:23.549 --> 01:12:26.009
like I promised to last year.

849
01:12:26.176 --> 01:12:29.012
But the sensitive nature of my work
for the government...

850
01:12:29.179 --> 01:12:31.431
demands utmost secrecy.

851
01:12:32.016 --> 01:12:34.767
I know you will understand.

852
01:12:35.686 --> 01:12:38.104
I am healthy and well
and making lots of money.

853
01:12:38.313 --> 01:12:40.606
I've been going with a girl
for several months...

854
01:12:40.858 --> 01:12:43.443
and I know you'd be proud
if you could see her.

855
01:12:44.028 --> 01:12:47.780
Her name is Betsy, but I can tell
you no more than that.

856
01:12:47.948 --> 01:12:50.324
Hey, cabbie, you can't Park here.

857
01:12:52.036 --> 01:12:55.413
Come on! Come on, let's go!
Let's go! Move it!

858
01:12:57.624 --> 01:13:01.252
Bear the burden of suffering
for the few.

859
01:13:01.462 --> 01:13:04.797
No more will we fight the wars
of the few...

860
01:13:04.965 --> 01:13:07.300
through the heart of the many.

861
01:13:11.138 --> 01:13:15.224
I hope this card finds you
all well, as it does me.

862
01:13:15.434 --> 01:13:18.811
I hope no one has died.
Don't worry about me.

863
01:13:19.063 --> 01:13:22.440
One day there will be a knock
on the door and it'll be me.

864
01:13:23.233 --> 01:13:25.234
Love, Travis.

865
01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:33.659
Don't you have some idea?

866
01:13:33.911 --> 01:13:35.661
I'm not the one who
wants to talk.

867
01:13:35.913 --> 01:13:39.916
But you must know that the reason
that I didn't marry him...

868
01:13:40.125 --> 01:13:44.003
is because I couldn't stand
to be a cause of divorce.

869
01:13:46.673 --> 01:13:50.134
Now he's getting a divorce anyway.

870
01:13:53.889 --> 01:13:56.307
Phillip wants to marry me, Brock.

871
01:13:59.603 --> 01:14:01.687
I do love him.

872
01:14:05.776 --> 01:14:07.360
What about us, June?

873
01:14:09.113 --> 01:14:10.696
Our marriage?

874
01:14:13.492 --> 01:14:15.493
You gotta know
our marriage wasn't legal.

875
01:14:15.702 --> 01:14:18.830
In the eyes of God, we are married.

876
01:14:21.041 --> 01:14:25.336
Brock, please don't do this to me.

877
01:14:27.714 --> 01:14:28.840
I love him so...

878
01:14:38.058 --> 01:14:39.684
Damn.

879
01:14:41.228 --> 01:14:43.229
Goddamn!

880
01:15:17.723 --> 01:15:19.765
They trying to get in the Picture.

881
01:15:24.062 --> 01:15:26.606
- You looking for some action?
- Yeah.

882
01:15:29.776 --> 01:15:33.237
- You see that guy over there?
- Yeah.

883
01:15:33.405 --> 01:15:35.573
You go talk to him.
His name is Matthew.

884
01:15:35.782 --> 01:15:39.285
- I'll be over there waiting for you.
- Okay.

885
01:15:42.789 --> 01:15:46.209
Your name Matthew?
I want some action.

886
01:15:46.710 --> 01:15:48.127
Officer.

887
01:15:49.421 --> 01:15:53.299
I swear I'm clean.
I'm just waiting here for a friend.

888
01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:55.801
You gonna bust me
for nothing, man?

889
01:15:56.053 --> 01:15:58.387
I'm not a cop. I ain't a...

890
01:15:58.597 --> 01:16:00.806
Then why are you
asking me for action?

891
01:16:03.393 --> 01:16:05.394
Because she sent me over.

892
01:16:07.648 --> 01:16:10.441
I suppose that ain't a .38
you've got in your sock.

893
01:16:10.651 --> 01:16:12.276
A .38?

894
01:16:13.987 --> 01:16:16.739
I'm clean, man.

895
01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:19.659
- Shit, you're a real cowboy?
- Yeah.

896
01:16:19.826 --> 01:16:23.329
That's nice, man. All right.
That's all right.

897
01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:27.291
Fifteen dollars, 1 5 minutes.
Twenty-five dollars, half an hour.

898
01:16:28.919 --> 01:16:30.419
Shit.

899
01:16:30.796 --> 01:16:32.046
A cowboy, huh?

900
01:16:33.674 --> 01:16:36.008
I once had a horse.
In Coney Island.

901
01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:37.927
She got hit by a car.

902
01:16:40.472 --> 01:16:42.306
Well, take it or leave it.

903
01:16:42.516 --> 01:16:45.643
If you wanna save yourself
some money, don't fuck her.

904
01:16:45.811 --> 01:16:47.645
Because you'll be back for more.

905
01:16:47.813 --> 01:16:51.691
She's 1 2 and a half years old.
You ain't never had no Pussy like that.

906
01:16:52.567 --> 01:16:54.610
Do anything you want.
Come on her...

907
01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:57.697
fuck her in the mouth, in the ass.
Come on her face.

908
01:16:57.948 --> 01:17:01.284
She'll get your cock so hard,
she'll make it explode.

909
01:17:03.370 --> 01:17:06.706
But no rough stuff. All right?

910
01:17:11.545 --> 01:17:13.379
All right, I'll take it.

911
01:17:13.672 --> 01:17:17.216
Hey, man! Don't take out no money
over here.

912
01:17:17.384 --> 01:17:18.634
You wanna fuck me?

913
01:17:18.885 --> 01:17:21.887
You're gonna fuck her,
you give her the money.

914
01:17:23.348 --> 01:17:24.890
Catch you later, copper.

915
01:17:26.184 --> 01:17:28.394
- What'd you say?
- I'll see you later, copPer.

916
01:17:30.689 --> 01:17:31.897
I'm no cop, man.

917
01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:36.527
Well, if you are,
it's entrapment already.

918
01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:40.865
I'm hip.

919
01:17:42.034 --> 01:17:44.243
Funny, you don't look hip.

920
01:17:48.206 --> 01:17:50.708
Go ahead. Have yourself a good time.
Go ahead, man.

921
01:17:59.509 --> 01:18:01.552
You're a funny guy.

922
01:18:04.681 --> 01:18:06.766
But looks aren't everything.

923
01:18:07.184 --> 01:18:09.060
Go ahead, man. Have a good time.

924
01:18:14.232 --> 01:18:16.275
You're a funny guy.

925
01:18:56.316 --> 01:18:57.983
Hey.

926
01:18:58.276 --> 01:19:00.444
The room'll cost you 10 bucks.

927
01:19:13.458 --> 01:19:15.334
I'm timing you too.

928
01:19:34.354 --> 01:19:35.938
Come on.

929
01:19:45.365 --> 01:19:47.116
Are you really 12 and a half?

930
01:19:49.369 --> 01:19:53.247
Listen, mister, it's your time.
Fifteen minutes ain't long.

931
01:19:55.792 --> 01:19:58.669
When that cigarette burns out,
your time is up.

932
01:20:02.757 --> 01:20:04.300
How old are you?

933
01:20:06.261 --> 01:20:08.053
You won't tell me?

934
01:20:08.472 --> 01:20:11.557
- What's your name?
- Easy.

935
01:20:11.766 --> 01:20:14.685
- That's not any kind of name.
- It's easy to remember.

936
01:20:14.895 --> 01:20:17.354
Yeah, but what's your real name?

937
01:20:17.731 --> 01:20:19.064
I don't like my real name.

938
01:20:19.399 --> 01:20:21.400
But what's your real name?

939
01:20:25.238 --> 01:20:26.655
Iris.

940
01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:29.158
What's wrong with that?
It's a nice name.

941
01:20:29.743 --> 01:20:31.452
That's what you think.

942
01:20:38.627 --> 01:20:41.754
No, don't do that. Don't do that.
Don't you remember me?

943
01:20:42.756 --> 01:20:46.091
Remember when you got into
a taxi? It was a checkered taxi.

944
01:20:46.384 --> 01:20:48.427
You got in and that guy
Matthew came by...

945
01:20:48.637 --> 01:20:51.096
and he said he wanted to
take you away.

946
01:20:51.389 --> 01:20:52.431
He pulled you away.

947
01:20:54.601 --> 01:20:55.809
I don't remember that.

948
01:20:57.395 --> 01:21:00.272
- You don't remember any of that?
- No.

949
01:21:01.608 --> 01:21:03.150
I'm gonna get you out of here.

950
01:21:03.443 --> 01:21:05.653
Listen, we better make it
or Sport'll get mad.

951
01:21:05.904 --> 01:21:08.948
- How do you wanna make it?
- I don't wanna make it. Who's Sport?

952
01:21:09.157 --> 01:21:11.951
That's Matthew. I call him Sport.

953
01:21:16.998 --> 01:21:18.999
Wanna make it like this?

954
01:21:24.965 --> 01:21:26.298
Listen, I...

955
01:21:26.466 --> 01:21:27.967
Can't you understand something?

956
01:21:28.218 --> 01:21:31.804
You're the one that came into my cab.
You wanted to get out of here.

957
01:21:32.013 --> 01:21:33.472
Well, I must've been stoned.

958
01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:37.309
- Why? They drug you?
- Oh, come off it, man.

959
01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:40.938
What are you doing?

960
01:21:41.147 --> 01:21:43.148
Don't you wanna make it?

961
01:21:46.236 --> 01:21:48.487
No, I don't wanna make it.
I wanna help you.

962
01:21:49.531 --> 01:21:51.323
Well, I could help you.

963
01:21:55.954 --> 01:21:57.204
Damn, man!

964
01:21:57.872 --> 01:21:59.498
Goddamn it!

965
01:22:03.503 --> 01:22:06.672
Shit, man. What the hell's
the matter with you?

966
01:22:07.549 --> 01:22:09.341
We don't have to make it, mister.

967
01:22:09.551 --> 01:22:11.594
Damn it!
Don't you wanna get out of here?

968
01:22:14.347 --> 01:22:17.016
Can't you understand why I'm here?

969
01:22:17.267 --> 01:22:19.518
I think I understand.

970
01:22:21.187 --> 01:22:23.022
I tried to get into your cab...

971
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:25.733
and now you wanna
come and take me away.

972
01:22:27.193 --> 01:22:30.571
- Is that it?
- Yeah, but don't you wanna go?

973
01:22:30.864 --> 01:22:34.700
- I can leave any time I want to.
- Then what about that one night?

974
01:22:36.786 --> 01:22:38.871
Look, I was stoned.

975
01:22:41.249 --> 01:22:43.500
That's why they stopped me.

976
01:22:45.295 --> 01:22:48.213
When I'm not stoned I got
no place else to go.

977
01:22:49.549 --> 01:22:51.425
So they just...

978
01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:54.136
protect me from myself.

979
01:23:01.603 --> 01:23:03.062
I don't know.

980
01:23:05.565 --> 01:23:07.900
I don't know. Okay, I tried.

981
01:23:08.777 --> 01:23:11.111
Hey, look, I understand.

982
01:23:11.404 --> 01:23:16.408
- And it means something, really.
- Yeah, well.

983
01:23:17.035 --> 01:23:18.744
Well, look, can I see you again?

984
01:23:18.912 --> 01:23:21.413
- That's not hard to do.
- I don't mean like that.

985
01:23:21.623 --> 01:23:25.417
I mean, you know, regularly.
This is nothing for a person to do.

986
01:23:25.919 --> 01:23:27.586
How about breakfast tomorrow?

987
01:23:27.962 --> 01:23:29.797
- Tomorrow?
- I get up at 1:00.

988
01:23:30.048 --> 01:23:32.424
- One o'clock?
- One o'clock.

989
01:23:34.969 --> 01:23:37.096
Well, I got a thing. I don't know...

990
01:23:37.305 --> 01:23:38.597
Do you want to or not?

991
01:23:38.807 --> 01:23:40.808
Yeah, I want... Okay, all right.

992
01:23:41.059 --> 01:23:42.559
- Okay, 1:00.
- One o'clock.

993
01:23:42.769 --> 01:23:45.437
Okay. See you tomorrow.

994
01:23:46.564 --> 01:23:49.608
Oh, Iris. My name is Travis.

995
01:23:50.819 --> 01:23:52.945
Thanks a lot, Travis.

996
01:23:54.614 --> 01:23:57.950
So long, Iris.
See you tomorrow.

997
01:23:59.285 --> 01:24:01.286
Sweet Iris.

998
01:24:25.311 --> 01:24:27.146
This is yours.

999
01:24:27.397 --> 01:24:28.981
Spend it right.

1000
01:24:34.362 --> 01:24:36.196
Come back anytime, cowboy.

1001
01:24:36.906 --> 01:24:38.240
I will.

1002
01:24:56.843 --> 01:24:59.678
Why do you want me
to go back to my parents?

1003
01:24:59.929 --> 01:25:01.388
They hate me.

1004
01:25:01.639 --> 01:25:04.892
Why do you think I split?
There ain't nothing there.

1005
01:25:05.185 --> 01:25:08.645
Yeah, but you can't live like this.
It's a hell.

1006
01:25:08.855 --> 01:25:10.689
A girl should live at home.

1007
01:25:11.524 --> 01:25:13.358
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?

1008
01:25:13.568 --> 01:25:15.360
What do you mean, "women's lib"?

1009
01:25:15.528 --> 01:25:18.405
You're a young girl.
You should be at home now.

1010
01:25:18.573 --> 01:25:20.741
You should be dressed up,
going out with boys.

1011
01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:22.534
You should be going to school.

1012
01:25:22.744 --> 01:25:26.455
- You know, that kind of stuff.
- Oh, God, are you square.

1013
01:25:26.706 --> 01:25:28.707
Hey, I'm not square. You're square.

1014
01:25:28.875 --> 01:25:30.751
You're full of shit, man.

1015
01:25:30.919 --> 01:25:33.212
What are you talking about?
You walk out with...

1016
01:25:33.379 --> 01:25:35.756
fucking creeps,
lowlifes and degenerates...

1017
01:25:36.049 --> 01:25:39.426
and you sell your little
pussy for nothing, man?

1018
01:25:39.677 --> 01:25:41.553
For some lowlife pimp?

1019
01:25:41.805 --> 01:25:43.889
Stands in a hall.

1020
01:25:45.183 --> 01:25:48.101
I'm the...? I'm square?
You're the one that's square, man.

1021
01:25:48.394 --> 01:25:51.730
I don't go screw and fuck with
killers and junkies the way you do.

1022
01:25:52.774 --> 01:25:54.733
You call that being hip?

1023
01:25:55.568 --> 01:25:57.402
What world you from?

1024
01:26:02.325 --> 01:26:05.410
- Who's a killer?
- That guy sport's a killer.

1025
01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:07.079
Sport never killed nobody.

1026
01:26:07.288 --> 01:26:08.747
- He killed...
- He's a Libra.

1027
01:26:08.957 --> 01:26:10.123
He's a what?

1028
01:26:10.333 --> 01:26:13.710
I'm a Libra too.
That's why we get along so well.

1029
01:26:16.130 --> 01:26:18.757
He looks like a killer to me.

1030
01:26:18.967 --> 01:26:22.636
I think that Cancers
make the best lovers...

1031
01:26:23.221 --> 01:26:25.097
but my whole family
are air signs.

1032
01:26:25.265 --> 01:26:26.473
He's also a dope-shooter.

1033
01:26:27.433 --> 01:26:30.644
What makes you so high and mighty?
Will you tell me that?

1034
01:26:31.104 --> 01:26:34.022
Did you ever try looking at
your own eyeballs in the mirror?

1035
01:26:40.113 --> 01:26:42.447
What'll you do about
sport and that old bastard?

1036
01:26:42.657 --> 01:26:44.783
- When?
- When you leave.

1037
01:26:48.454 --> 01:26:49.621
I'll just leave them.

1038
01:26:49.831 --> 01:26:51.665
- Just leave?
- They got other girls.

1039
01:26:51.875 --> 01:26:54.793
You just can't do that.
What are you gonna do?

1040
01:26:57.755 --> 01:26:59.131
Want me to call the cops?

1041
01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:01.842
The cops don't do nothing.
You know that.

1042
01:27:02.468 --> 01:27:06.179
Look, Sport never treated me bad.
He didn't beat me up once.

1043
01:27:06.472 --> 01:27:09.808
But you can't allow him to do
the same to other girls.

1044
01:27:09.976 --> 01:27:11.560
You can't allow him to do that.

1045
01:27:11.811 --> 01:27:13.979
He is the lowest kind of person.

1046
01:27:14.272 --> 01:27:16.148
Somebody's got to do
something to him.

1047
01:27:16.357 --> 01:27:17.816
He's the scum of the earth.

1048
01:27:18.067 --> 01:27:19.568
He's the worst...

1049
01:27:20.862 --> 01:27:23.363
sucking scum
I have ever, ever seen.

1050
01:27:26.159 --> 01:27:28.535
You know what he told me about you?

1051
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:34.583
He called you names. He called
you a little Piece of chicken.

1052
01:27:36.085 --> 01:27:39.171
He does... He...
He doesn't mean it.

1053
01:27:41.174 --> 01:27:44.843
I'll move up to one of them
communes in Vermont.

1054
01:27:49.182 --> 01:27:52.184
I never seen a commune before,
but I don't know.

1055
01:27:52.393 --> 01:27:54.519
I saw...

1056
01:27:54.854 --> 01:27:57.940
some Photos once in a magazine.
It didn't look very clean.

1057
01:27:58.524 --> 01:28:00.442
Why don't you come with me?

1058
01:28:00.693 --> 01:28:04.237
What? Come to the commune
with you? No, no.

1059
01:28:04.447 --> 01:28:05.864
Why not?

1060
01:28:07.742 --> 01:28:11.620
- I don't go to places like that.
- Oh, come on, why not?

1061
01:28:11.871 --> 01:28:13.872
I don't get along with
people like that.

1062
01:28:14.374 --> 01:28:16.249
- Are you a Scorpion?
- What?

1063
01:28:16.417 --> 01:28:19.878
That's it. You're a Scorpion.
I can tell every time.

1064
01:28:20.922 --> 01:28:23.048
Besides, I gotta stay here.

1065
01:28:23.257 --> 01:28:26.051
- Come on. Why?
- I got something very important to do.

1066
01:28:26.219 --> 01:28:27.844
So, what's so important?

1067
01:28:29.639 --> 01:28:31.932
I'm doing something
for the government.

1068
01:28:32.767 --> 01:28:35.060
The cab thing is just part-time.

1069
01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:37.729
Are you a narc?

1070
01:28:40.149 --> 01:28:41.358
Do I look like a narc?

1071
01:28:42.235 --> 01:28:43.902
Yeah.

1072
01:28:44.570 --> 01:28:46.363
I am a narc.

1073
01:28:47.448 --> 01:28:50.909
God! I don't know who's
weirder, you or me.

1074
01:28:57.250 --> 01:29:01.253
- Sure you don't wanna come with me?
- I'll give you the money to go.

1075
01:29:01.796 --> 01:29:04.464
- You don't have to do that.
- I want you to take it.

1076
01:29:04.757 --> 01:29:07.467
I don't want you to take
anything from them.

1077
01:29:07.802 --> 01:29:09.511
And I wanna do it.

1078
01:29:09.887 --> 01:29:12.264
I don't have anything better
to do with my money.

1079
01:29:14.142 --> 01:29:16.435
I might be going away
for a while.

1080
01:29:42.045 --> 01:29:45.464
You're just a little tense,
that's all.

1081
01:29:45.715 --> 01:29:48.175
I don't like what I'm doing, Sport.

1082
01:29:48.468 --> 01:29:51.428
Baby, I never wanted you
to like what you're doing.

1083
01:29:51.637 --> 01:29:55.557
If you ever liked what you were doing,
you wouldn't be my woman.

1084
01:29:57.310 --> 01:29:59.811
You never spend any time
with me anymore.

1085
01:29:59.979 --> 01:30:03.065
Well, I got to attend
to business, baby.

1086
01:30:04.150 --> 01:30:06.651
You miss your man, don't you?

1087
01:30:07.987 --> 01:30:11.364
I don't like to be away
from you either.

1088
01:30:11.574 --> 01:30:14.159
You know how I feel about you.

1089
01:30:15.244 --> 01:30:17.245
I depend on you.

1090
01:30:19.665 --> 01:30:20.832
I'd be lost without you.

1091
01:30:22.335 --> 01:30:24.753
Don't you ever forget that.

1092
01:30:34.180 --> 01:30:36.473
How much I need you.

1093
01:30:38.559 --> 01:30:40.393
Come to me, baby.

1094
01:30:50.530 --> 01:30:52.280
Let me hold you.

1095
01:30:58.871 --> 01:31:03.125
When you're close to me like this,
I feel so good.

1096
01:31:07.797 --> 01:31:12.300
I only wish every man could know
what it's like to be loved by you.

1097
01:31:17.265 --> 01:31:20.225
That every woman, everywhere...

1098
01:31:21.936 --> 01:31:25.063
had a man who loves her
like I love you.

1099
01:31:28.901 --> 01:31:32.320
God, it's good so close.

1100
01:31:44.292 --> 01:31:46.293
You know, at times like this...

1101
01:31:46.794 --> 01:31:49.629
I know I'm a lucky man.

1102
01:31:52.425 --> 01:31:55.677
Touching a woman who
wants me and needs me.

1103
01:32:02.143 --> 01:32:05.103
It's only you that keeps me together.

1104
01:33:37.196 --> 01:33:40.031
Now I see it clearly.
My whole life has pointed...

1105
01:33:40.241 --> 01:33:42.534
in one direction. I see that now.

1106
01:33:44.203 --> 01:33:47.247
There never has been
any choice for me.

1107
01:34:22.366 --> 01:34:23.408
Ladies and gentlemen...

1108
01:34:23.617 --> 01:34:27.912
the next president of the United
States, Senator Charles Palantine.

1109
01:34:34.337 --> 01:34:35.628
Thank you, Tom.

1110
01:34:36.922 --> 01:34:38.089
Ladies and gentlemen...

1111
01:34:39.091 --> 01:34:43.428
we are met today at a crossroads,
Columbus Circle.

1112
01:34:43.596 --> 01:34:45.764
This is no ordinary Place.

1113
01:34:45.973 --> 01:34:50.769
It is a place where many roads
and many lives intersect.

1114
01:34:51.937 --> 01:34:54.606
It is appropriate that
we meet here today...

1115
01:34:54.899 --> 01:34:58.151
because these
are not ordinary times.

1116
01:34:58.444 --> 01:35:01.446
We meet at a crossroads in history.

1117
01:35:03.115 --> 01:35:06.785
For far too long, the wrong roads
have been taken.

1118
01:35:07.078 --> 01:35:11.289
The wrong roads have led us
into war, into poverty...

1119
01:35:11.582 --> 01:35:14.417
into unemployment and inflation.

1120
01:35:15.294 --> 01:35:18.963
Today I say to you,
we have reached the turning point.

1121
01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:26.971
No longer will we, the people,
suffer for the few.

1122
01:35:35.147 --> 01:35:39.442
Now, I would lie to you if I told you
the new roads would be easy.

1123
01:35:40.111 --> 01:35:42.153
They will not be easy.

1124
01:35:42.446 --> 01:35:45.949
Nothing that is right and good
has ever been easy.

1125
01:35:46.158 --> 01:35:48.159
We, the People, know that.

1126
01:35:52.206 --> 01:35:56.418
And we, the People,
know the right roads and the good.

1127
01:35:57.420 --> 01:36:01.714
Today I say to you,
we are the People, you and I.

1128
01:36:01.966 --> 01:36:05.218
And it is time to let the people rule!

1129
01:36:05.469 --> 01:36:06.678
Thank you.

1130
01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:25.196
All right, let him through. Pull back.

1131
01:36:29.952 --> 01:36:32.078
Palantine.

1132
01:36:39.837 --> 01:36:41.546
Thank you. Thank you.

1133
01:36:46.469 --> 01:36:47.844
Over there. Get that man.

1134
01:36:50.181 --> 01:36:51.764
Give him some air!

1135
01:36:52.475 --> 01:36:54.392
Give him some air, will you?

1136
01:36:54.685 --> 01:36:56.561
- I never saw him.
- I saw him run.

1137
01:36:56.854 --> 01:36:58.730
- I saw him.
- Where was he?

1138
01:37:25.382 --> 01:37:26.549
What's happening?

1139
01:37:26.759 --> 01:37:28.092
Got the money?

1140
01:37:39.271 --> 01:37:40.438
- Iris in her room?
- Yeah.

1141
01:37:40.606 --> 01:37:42.106
Okay.

1142
01:38:17.851 --> 01:38:19.811
Hey, sport, how you doing?

1143
01:38:19.979 --> 01:38:22.105
Okay, okay, my man. How...?

1144
01:38:23.607 --> 01:38:26.484
- Where do I know you from, man?
- I don't know.

1145
01:38:26.694 --> 01:38:28.987
How's everything
in the pimp business?

1146
01:38:30.155 --> 01:38:32.323
- Do I know you?
- No.

1147
01:38:32.575 --> 01:38:33.992
Do I know you?

1148
01:38:34.285 --> 01:38:36.119
Get out of here.
Come on, get lost.

1149
01:38:36.328 --> 01:38:37.954
Do I know you?

1150
01:38:40.291 --> 01:38:41.666
How's Iris?

1151
01:38:41.959 --> 01:38:43.334
You know Iris.

1152
01:38:43.586 --> 01:38:46.296
No, I don't know nobody named Iris.

1153
01:38:46.505 --> 01:38:48.590
Iris? Come on, get out of here, man.

1154
01:38:49.091 --> 01:38:53.803
- You don't know anybody named Iris?
- I don't know nobody named Iris.

1155
01:38:54.305 --> 01:38:55.513
No?

1156
01:38:55.848 --> 01:38:58.391
Get back to your fucking tribe
before you get hurt.

1157
01:38:58.684 --> 01:39:01.102
I don't want no trouble, okay?

1158
01:39:02.605 --> 01:39:04.022
You got a gun?

1159
01:39:05.232 --> 01:39:08.359
Get the fuck out of here, man.
Get out of here.

1160
01:39:08.861 --> 01:39:10.486
Suck on this.

1161
01:39:45.564 --> 01:39:46.564
Hey!

1162
01:40:24.728 --> 01:40:26.771
You crazy son of a bitch!

1163
01:40:27.064 --> 01:40:28.439
Fucking son of a bitch!

1164
01:40:28.732 --> 01:40:33.319
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

1165
01:40:33.487 --> 01:40:36.489
I'll kill you!
I'll fucking kill you!

1166
01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:38.825
Crazy son of a bitch!
I'll kill you!

1167
01:40:56.468 --> 01:40:57.802
Crazy son of a bitch!

1168
01:40:57.970 --> 01:41:01.431
You fucking bastard! I'll kill you!

1169
01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:04.767
You crazy son of a bitch!
I'll kill you!

1170
01:41:04.935 --> 01:41:08.980
I'll kill you! I'll kill
you! I'll kill you!

1171
01:41:11.942 --> 01:41:13.651
Stop!

1172
01:41:26.457 --> 01:41:27.540
Don't shoot him!

1173
01:46:07.112 --> 01:46:08.612
Dear Mr. Bickle:

1174
01:46:08.822 --> 01:46:12.783
I can't say how happy
Mrs. Steensma and I were...

1175
01:46:12.951 --> 01:46:15.953
to hear that you are
well and recuperating.

1176
01:46:16.163 --> 01:46:19.040
We tried to visit you at the hospital...

1177
01:46:19.291 --> 01:46:21.959
when we were in New York
to pick up Iris...

1178
01:46:22.252 --> 01:46:24.795
but you were still in a coma.

1179
01:46:25.088 --> 01:46:27.131
There is no way we can repay you...

1180
01:46:27.340 --> 01:46:30.468
for returning our Iris to us.

1181
01:46:30.761 --> 01:46:32.428
We thought we had lost her...

1182
01:46:32.637 --> 01:46:35.806
and now our lives are full again.

1183
01:46:36.308 --> 01:46:37.641
Needless to say...

1184
01:46:37.851 --> 01:46:42.354
you are something
of a hero around this household.

1185
01:46:43.106 --> 01:46:46.609
I'm sure you want to know about Iris.

1186
01:46:46.818 --> 01:46:50.321
She's back in school and working hard.

1187
01:46:50.614 --> 01:46:53.657
The transition has been
very hard for her...

1188
01:46:53.825 --> 01:46:55.159
as you can well imagine.

1189
01:46:56.661 --> 01:46:58.204
But we have taken steps to see...

1190
01:46:58.455 --> 01:47:02.625
she has never cause
to run away again.

1191
01:47:03.210 --> 01:47:04.627
In conclusion...

1192
01:47:04.836 --> 01:47:08.589
Mrs. Steensma and I
would like to again thank you...

1193
01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:11.509
from the bottom of our hearts.

1194
01:47:11.718 --> 01:47:15.805
Unfortunately, we cannot afford
to come to New York again...

1195
01:47:16.014 --> 01:47:19.975
to thank you in person,
or we surely would.

1196
01:47:20.185 --> 01:47:23.020
But if you should ever
come to Pittsburgh...

1197
01:47:23.313 --> 01:47:27.858
you would find yourself
a most welcome guest in our home.

1198
01:47:28.151 --> 01:47:33.030
Our deepest thanks,
Burt and lvy Steensma.

1199
01:47:34.241 --> 01:47:38.536
Eddie, the owner-operator, comes up,
he says, "Hey, I wanna swap tires."

1200
01:47:38.703 --> 01:47:40.329
I say, "These are new tires.

1201
01:47:40.872 --> 01:47:43.707
Why not throw in something else,
like your wife?"

1202
01:47:43.917 --> 01:47:48.003
- His wife was Miss New Jersey of 1 957.
- That's why the fleet has no spares.

1203
01:47:48.213 --> 01:47:50.631
- Doughboy, Wizard, killer.
- Hey.

1204
01:47:50.841 --> 01:47:53.259
- Charlie T.
- What's happening?

1205
01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:55.761
Hey, Travis, you got a fare.

1206
01:47:57.264 --> 01:47:58.556
Shit.

1207
01:47:59.391 --> 01:48:00.766
Well, see you later.

1208
01:48:01.059 --> 01:48:02.685
See you, Travis.

1209
01:48:23.790 --> 01:48:25.583
Hello, Travis.

1210
01:48:27.043 --> 01:48:28.252
Hello.

1211
01:48:49.191 --> 01:48:51.901
I hear Palantine got the nomination.

1212
01:48:53.195 --> 01:48:56.280
Yeah, won't be long now.
Seventeen days.

1213
01:48:57.324 --> 01:48:59.200
Well, I hope he wins.

1214
01:49:12.797 --> 01:49:15.925
I read about you in the papers.
How are you?

1215
01:49:18.762 --> 01:49:21.472
Oh, it was nothing, really.
I got over that.

1216
01:49:23.975 --> 01:49:26.477
The papers always
blow these things up.

1217
01:49:28.313 --> 01:49:31.607
Just a little stiffness. That's all.

1218
01:50:07.852 --> 01:50:09.853
Travis.

1219
01:50:15.568 --> 01:50:17.278
How much was it?

1220
01:50:26.413 --> 01:50:27.788
So long.
