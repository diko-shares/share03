1
00:02:28.732 --> 00:02:29.938
Harry, answer that.

2
00:02:33.528 --> 00:02:35.735
So, what do you wanna hack for, Bickle?

3
00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.400
I can't sleep nights.

4
00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:41.367
- There's porno theaters for that.
- Yeah, I know. I tried that.

5
00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:47.660
So, what do you do now?

6
00:02:47.918 --> 00:02:51.752
Now? Ride around nights mostly.
Subways, buses.

7
00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.872
Figure, you know, I'm gonna do that,
I might as well get paid for it.

8
00:02:55.092 --> 00:02:57.424
You wanna work uptown nights?
South Bronx, Harlem?

9
00:02:57.636 --> 00:02:59.343
I'll work anytime, anywhere.

10
00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:01.010
Will you work Jewish holidays?

11
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:02.922
Anytime, anywhere.

12
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.558
All right. Let me see
your chauffeur's license.

13
00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:10.604
- How's your driving record?
- It's clean.

14
00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:12.973
It's real clean, like my conscience.

15
00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:16.982
You gonna break my chops? Guys like
you come in here to break my chops.

16
00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:20.565
If you're gonna break my chops,
take it on the arches now, understand?

17
00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:23.154
<i>Sorry, sir, I didn't mean that.</i>

18
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.537
- Physical?
- Clean.

19
00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:28.534
- Age?
- Twenty-six.

20
00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:30.453
Education?

21
00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.117
Some.

22
00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:34.411
Here, there, you know.

23
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.716
Military record?

24
00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:42.135
Honorable discharge.

25
00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:44.634
May 1973.

26
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:46.848
- Were you in the Army?
- Marines.

27
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.102
I was in the Marines too.

28
00:03:53.692 --> 00:03:55.478
So, what is it?

29
00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:57.768
You need an extra job?

30
00:03:58.613 --> 00:04:00.274
Are you moonlighting?

31
00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:04.275
Well, I... I just wanna work long hours.

32
00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:05.947
What's moonlighting?

33
00:04:06.163 --> 00:04:09.281
Look, just fill out these forms
and check back tomorrow...

34
00:04:09.458 --> 00:04:11.449
when the shift breaks.

35
00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:16.041
O'Brien, please step up. Take the car
out through 58th Street, please.

36
00:04:16.298 --> 00:04:18.084
Because it's crowded on 57th.

37
00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:21.751
Hey, Rodriguez!

38
00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:31.762
All right, all right,
I'm coming down there.

39
00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:15.354
May 10th.

40
00:05:15.524 --> 00:05:17.811
<i>Thank God for the rain,
which has helped wash away...</i>

41
00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:21.318
<i>the garbage and the trash
off the sidewalks.</i>

42
00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:24.108
<i>I'm working long hours now.</i>

43
00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:28.109
<i>Six in the afternoon to 6 in the
morning, sometimes even 8 in the morning.</i>

44
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.453
<i>Six days a week,
sometimes seven days a week.</i>

45
00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:34.573
<i>It's a long hustle,
but it keeps me real busy.</i>

46
00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:37.042
<i>I can take in $300, $350 a week.</i>

47
00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:39.832
<i>Sometimes even more
when I do it off the meter.</i>

48
00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:07.276
<i>All the animals come out at night.</i>

49
00:06:07.993 --> 00:06:12.533
<i>Whores, skunk-pussies, buggers,
queens, fairies, dopers, junkies.</i>

50
00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:15.697
<i>Sick, venal.</i>

51
00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:23.297
<i>Someday a real rain'll come and
wash all this scum off the streets.</i>

52
00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:35.267
<i>I go all over. I take people to the
Bronx, Brooklyn. I take them to Harlem.</i>

53
00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:38.436
<i>I don't care.
Don't make no difference to me.</i>

54
00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:42.228
<i>It does to some.
Some won't even take spooks.</i>

55
00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:44.021
<i>Don't make no difference to me.</i>

56
00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:45.861
Driver, 48th and 6th, please.

57
00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:49.360
Man, you are gorgeous!
Beautiful little girl.

58
00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:54.945
I can't afford to get stopped anywhere.

59
00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:57.327
Oh, no. We wouldn't
want that to happen.

60
00:06:58.001 --> 00:07:01.244
There'll be a big tip in it for you,
you do the right things.

61
00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:03.378
You got a way.

62
00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:05.043
You got a way.

63
00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:08.709
Yeah. Now you're talking!

64
00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:11.427
Driver, hurry up, will you?

65
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.505
Yeah.

66
00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:51.126
<i>Each night when I return
the cab to the garage...</i>

67
00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:54.171
<i>I have to clean the come
off the back seat.</i>

68
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.478
<i>Some nights, I clean off the blood.</i>

69
00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:36.342
Can I help you?

70
00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:38.590
Yeah, what's your name?

71
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.175
My name is Travis.

72
00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:43.179
That's nice. What can I do for you?

73
00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:47.224
I'd like to know what your
name is. What's your name?

74
00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:49.484
Give me a break.

75
00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:53.610
Look, you can tell me what your name is.
I'm not gonna do anything.

76
00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:57.451
- Do you want me to call the manager?
- You don't have to call the manager.

77
00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:01.113
- Troy!
- All right. Okay, I mean...

78
00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:05.497
Okay. Can I have a Chuckles there?

79
00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:10.794
And do you have any Jujubes? They last
longer. I'd like to get some Jujubes.

80
00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:13.216
What you see is what we got.

81
00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:19.886
A Clark.

82
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.852
I'll take these.

83
00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:27.681
Coca-Cola.

84
00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:31.769
We don't have Coca-Cola.
Royal Crown Cola is all we got.

85
00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:35.105
A dollar eighty-five.

86
00:09:57.263 --> 00:10:00.551
<i>Twelve hours of work
and I still can't sleep.</i>

87
00:10:01.476 --> 00:10:02.682
<i>Damn.</i>

88
00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:06.975
<i>The days go on and on.
And they don't end.</i>

89
00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:11.854
<i>All my life needed was
a sense of some place to go.</i>

90
00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:16.447
<i>I don't believe that one should devote
his life to morbid self-attention.</i>

91
00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:19.987
<i>I believe that someone should
become a person like other people.</i>

92
00:10:22.914 --> 00:10:27.283
<i>I first saw her at Palantine campaign
headquarters at 63rd and Broadway.</i>

93
00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:31.249
<i>She was wearing a white dress.</i>

94
00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:33.921
<i>She appeared like an angel...</i>

95
00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:37.046
<i>out of this filthy mass.</i>

96
00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:39.135
<i>She is alone.</i>

97
00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:41.838
<i>They...</i>

98
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:43.715
<i>cannot...</i>

99
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:45.596
<i>Touch...</i>

100
00:10:46.437 --> 00:10:47.677
<i>her.</i>

101
00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:02.075
Yes. Well, you delivered
two boxes.

102
00:11:02.245 --> 00:11:05.033
I think it's a total
of 5000 campaign buttons.

103
00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.578
Now, all the ones we had
before and our slogan is:

104
00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:11.497
"We are the people,”
and "are" is underlined.

105
00:11:11.754 --> 00:11:14.212
These new buttons have "we" underlined.

106
00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:19.005
That reads, "We are the people."
Well, I think there's a difference.

107
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:23.134
"We are the people” is not
the same as "We are the people.”

108
00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:25.424
Let's not fight.

109
00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:28.351
Look, we'll make it real simple.

110
00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:30.687
We don't pay for the buttons.

111
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:35.229
- We throw the buttons away, all right?
- Tom, come here a minute.

112
00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:38.144
What?

113
00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:45.864
What is it?

114
00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:47.516
This canvass report
is about ready to go.

115
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.703
If Andy okays it, have a copy sent to
headquarters in every county.

116
00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:52.997
Okay, I gotta get that
<i>New York Times </i>article xeroxed.

117
00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:55.232
- Don't forget the new photos.
- I didn't forget it.

118
00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:58.624
Now, look, we have to emphasize
the mandatory welfare program.

119
00:11:58.801 --> 00:12:00.361
That's the issue that should be pushed.

120
00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:02.252
First push the man, then the issue.

121
00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:04.463
Senator Palantine is a dynamic man.

122
00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:07.716
An intelligent, interesting,
fresh, fascinating man.

123
00:12:07.936 --> 00:12:09.097
You forgot sexy.

124
00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:10.677
Man, I did not forget sexy.

125
00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:13.616
Listen to what you're saying.
You sound like you're selling mouthwash.

126
00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:14.894
We are selling mouthwash.

127
00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:17.059
- Are we authorized to do that?
- Very funny.

128
00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:20.480
You can get in trouble selling
pharmaceuticals in a campaign office.

129
00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:23.194
My uncle's in jail because of that.

130
00:12:23.618 --> 00:12:27.532
It's not really jail. Of course, living
with his wife, anything would be jail.

131
00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:29.033
Look over there.

132
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.496
I love you.

133
00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:31.823
Notice anything?

134
00:12:32.043 --> 00:12:34.250
- No.
- Well, put your glasses on.

135
00:12:34.504 --> 00:12:37.041
Okay, just a minute.
All right.

136
00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:39.544
That taxi driver's been staring at us.

137
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.095
What taxi driver?

138
00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:52.435
That one, the one that's sitting there.

139
00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:56.023
- How long has he been there?
- I don't know. It feels like a long time.

140
00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:59.063
- Does he bother you?
- No.

141
00:12:59.362 --> 00:13:01.353
You really mean yes,
and you're being sarcastic.

142
00:13:01.572 --> 00:13:03.438
Oh, you're quick. You're really quick.

143
00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:05.194
Well, I try to be real quick.

144
00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:07.846
I'll tell you what. I'll play
the male in this relationship...

145
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:09.110
Good luck.

146
00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:12.660
And tell him to move.
And I don't need good luck. Thank you.

147
00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:15.625
Oh, yes, you do.
You just think you don't.

148
00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:27.425
Say, you're blocking our doorway.
Think you might wanna move your cab?

149
00:15:08.366 --> 00:15:11.074
You know, eye shadow, mascara...

150
00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:12.776
lipstick, rouge.

151
00:15:13.037 --> 00:15:15.870
Not rouge. Blush-on, they call it.

152
00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:20.455
- The kind with the brush.
- Yeah, it's Blush-on.

153
00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:23.331
Travis.

154
00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:27.336
- Hey, Wiz.
- That's Blush-on. My wife uses it.

155
00:15:27.969 --> 00:15:29.630
Ask Travis. He's a ladies' man.

156
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.261
A cup of coffee, please.

157
00:15:32.473 --> 00:15:35.261
Anyway, whatever the fuck it is,
she uses a lot of it, you know?

158
00:15:35.476 --> 00:15:37.888
And then perfume. The spray kind.

159
00:15:38.062 --> 00:15:40.599
And then, get this. In the
middle of the Triborough Bridge...

160
00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:44.024
- And this woman is beautiful.
- -she changes her pantyhose.

161
00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:45.517
- No.
- Oh, yeah.

162
00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:48.819
- What'd you do?
- I throw the meter, you know...

163
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.231
jump in the back seat
and I whip it out.

164
00:15:51.325 --> 00:15:53.407
I said, "You know what this is?"

165
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.430
She says, "It's love." ” You know,
I'm gonna fuck her brains out.

166
00:15:56.622 --> 00:15:58.238
She goes wild, you know, and she said:

167
00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:01.158
"That's the greatest
single experience of my life."

168
00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:04.920
Then she gave me a $200 tip
and her phone number in Acapulco.

169
00:16:06.382 --> 00:16:08.419
Travis, you know Doughboy, Charlie T.?

170
00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:12.844
Hey, Travis. Got change for a nickel?

171
00:16:13.055 --> 00:16:15.422
We call him Doughboy because
he'll do anything for a buck.

172
00:16:15.766 --> 00:16:17.552
So, uh...

173
00:16:17.894 --> 00:16:19.680
So how's it hanging?

174
00:16:23.941 --> 00:16:25.306
What's that?

175
00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:32.197
Well, I turn on the radio. Some fleet
driver from Bell just got all cut up.

176
00:16:32.366 --> 00:16:33.481
Stickup?

177
00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:37.402
No, he got cut up by some crazy fucker.
Cut half his ear off.

178
00:16:37.622 --> 00:16:41.240
- Where?
- It was at 122nd Street.

179
00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:43.833
Fucking Mau Mau land.

180
00:16:47.548 --> 00:16:50.131
You run all over town,
don't you, Travis?

181
00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:53.585
Travis?

182
00:16:57.266 --> 00:16:59.348
Travis.

183
00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:02.518
- You run all over town, don't you?
- Yeah.

184
00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:05.055
I mean, you handle some
pretty rough customers, huh?

185
00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:06.806
Yeah, I have.

186
00:17:07.318 --> 00:17:10.276
- You carry a piece?
- No.

187
00:17:10.446 --> 00:17:12.562
- You need one?
- No.

188
00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:15.982
You need one, I know a fella
who can get you a real nice deal.

189
00:17:16.244 --> 00:17:18.076
There's lots of shit around.

190
00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:20.738
I never use mine.
I'm conservative, you know.

191
00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:24.825
But it's a good thing to have
just as a threat.

192
00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:38.095
I'm gonna go dig my dirt.

193
00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:40.970
Travis.

194
00:17:42.478 --> 00:17:43.718
Look.

195
00:17:44.605 --> 00:17:47.063
Piece of Errol Flynn's bathtub.

196
00:17:47.775 --> 00:17:49.186
Dig the symbols.

197
00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:53.232
F-4-0-5-4-3-4.

198
00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:56.239
And the watermark.

199
00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.157
There's one person...

200
00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:00.027
there's two persons...

201
00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:01.736
and there's three persons.

202
00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:04.155
I got this at his estate, The Pines.

203
00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:06.620
Look, why don't you take it,
and if you can sell it...

204
00:18:06.794 --> 00:18:10.207
- you give me half of what you got.
- I don't want to.

205
00:18:10.381 --> 00:18:13.544
Well... Hey, I'm gonna get
in my cab and boogie.

206
00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:30.978
- Oh, I'm so terribly sorry.
- What? Well...

207
00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:35.024
- Nothing.
- That's very cute. Thank you.

208
00:18:35.239 --> 00:18:37.105
Hey, you wanna see something?

209
00:18:37.908 --> 00:18:40.866
Wait, I just typed,
"You wanna see something?"

210
00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:43.866
- What?
- If you had...

211
00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.327
these three fingers
missing on this hand...

212
00:18:46.542 --> 00:18:48.783
and that hand missing on that hand...

213
00:18:49.837 --> 00:18:52.670
- how would you light the match?
- I wouldn't light a match.

214
00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:55.040
Go ahead. Give it a try.

215
00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:59.002
Well, I don't think I could do it.

216
00:18:59.263 --> 00:19:00.503
No?

217
00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:02.381
It's gonna be difficult.

218
00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:04.424
I'll give it a try.

219
00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:12.019
Oh.

220
00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:15.276
I got my thumb back for a second.
Thank God.

221
00:19:16.572 --> 00:19:17.983
Just a minute.

222
00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.030
I can't do it.

223
00:19:27.541 --> 00:19:29.282
Well, the guy at the
news stand can do it.

224
00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:31.539
Well, I don't work at a news stand.

225
00:19:33.089 --> 00:19:34.796
- Anyway, he's probably Italian.
- No.

226
00:19:35.049 --> 00:19:36.777
- You're sure he's not Italian?
- He's black.

227
00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:40.135
If he was Italian, he might've been a
thief. They do that, the mob does that.

228
00:19:40.388 --> 00:19:43.972
If a thief screws up on the job,
you know, they'll blow his fingers off.

229
00:19:44.308 --> 00:19:46.912
I'll tell you something else.
This sounds like a joke, but it's true.

230
00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:50.099
If they kill a stool pigeon,
they leave a canary on the body.

231
00:19:50.314 --> 00:19:53.602
- Apparently it's symbolic.
- Why not a pigeon instead of a canary?

232
00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:56.526
I don't know why not
a pigeon. Wait a minute.

233
00:19:56.737 --> 00:19:59.274
You gotta catch a pigeon.
You can get a canary in a pet store.

234
00:19:59.448 --> 00:20:00.609
Long as you pay for it...

235
00:20:00.825 --> 00:20:03.665
boom, Kill it right there. Put it on
anyone you want. Doesn't matter.

236
00:20:30.521 --> 00:20:33.934
- Hi. I'd like to volunteer.
- Great. I'll take you right over here.

237
00:20:34.191 --> 00:20:36.808
That's all right. I'd rather volunteer
to her, if you don't mind.

238
00:20:40.656 --> 00:20:42.897
Why do you feel that
you have to volunteer to me?

239
00:20:43.117 --> 00:20:47.236
Because I think that you are the most
beautiful woman I have ever seen.

240
00:20:49.832 --> 00:20:51.038
Thanks.

241
00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:53.499
But what do you think of Palantine?

242
00:20:57.006 --> 00:20:58.713
Well, I...

243
00:20:58.883 --> 00:21:02.171
Charles Palantine, the man you're
volunteering to help elect president.

244
00:21:03.804 --> 00:21:05.590
Well, I'm sure he'll make
a good president.

245
00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:09.178
I don't know what his policies are,
but I'm sure he'll make a good one.

246
00:21:10.853 --> 00:21:13.265
- You wanna canvass?
- Yeah, I'll canvass.

247
00:21:13.564 --> 00:21:16.056
How do you feel about
the senator's stand on welfare?

248
00:21:16.275 --> 00:21:20.735
I don't know the senator's stand on
welfare, but I'm sure it's a good stand.

249
00:21:20.988 --> 00:21:23.855
- You're sure of that?
- Yeah.

250
00:21:26.243 --> 00:21:28.563
Well, we all work together
here full-time, day and night...

251
00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:31.906
so if you'd like to step over there,
the gentlemen will sign you up.

252
00:21:32.166 --> 00:21:36.660
The thing is, I drive a taxi at night,
so it's kind of hard for me...

253
00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:40.209
to work in the day. So, uh...

254
00:21:40.591 --> 00:21:42.298
Then what exactly do you want?

255
00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:45.252
Would you like to come have
some coffee and pie with me?

256
00:21:45.471 --> 00:21:46.711
Why?

257
00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:49.134
- Why? I'll tell you why.
- Yeah.

258
00:21:50.726 --> 00:21:52.433
I think you're a lonely person.

259
00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:55.265
I drive by this place a lot,
and I see you here.

260
00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:57.472
I see a lot of people around you...

261
00:21:57.691 --> 00:22:00.774
and I see these phones
and all this stuff on your desk...

262
00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:02.317
that means nothing.

263
00:22:02.571 --> 00:22:04.653
And when I came inside and I met you...

264
00:22:04.907 --> 00:22:07.615
saw in your eyes, and I saw
the way you carried yourself...

265
00:22:07.868 --> 00:22:10.030
that you're not a happy person.

266
00:22:10.663 --> 00:22:12.404
And I think you need something.

267
00:22:12.623 --> 00:22:15.490
And if you wanna call it a friend,
you can call it a friend.

268
00:22:16.252 --> 00:22:19.790
- You're gonna be my friend?
- Yeah.

269
00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.170
What do you say?

270
00:22:33.352 --> 00:22:37.016
It's a little hard standing here
and asking you, so...

271
00:22:41.318 --> 00:22:44.982
Five minutes, that's all.
Just outside. Right around here.

272
00:22:45.197 --> 00:22:46.904
I'm there to protect you.

273
00:22:52.997 --> 00:22:55.238
Come on. Just take a little break.

274
00:22:58.168 --> 00:23:00.500
I have a break at 4:00.
And if you're here...

275
00:23:00.754 --> 00:23:02.745
- 4:00 today?
- Yes.

276
00:23:02.965 --> 00:23:05.878
- I'll be here.
- I'm sure you will.

277
00:23:06.302 --> 00:23:09.010
- All right, 4 p.m.
- Right.

278
00:23:09.597 --> 00:23:11.053
- Outside in the front?
- Yes.

279
00:23:11.223 --> 00:23:12.463
Okay.

280
00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:15.099
Oh, my name is Travis. Betsy?

281
00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:17.927
Travis.

282
00:23:18.522 --> 00:23:20.684
I appreciate this, Betsy.

283
00:23:35.372 --> 00:23:37.613
<i>May 26th, 4:00 p.m.</i>

284
00:23:37.917 --> 00:23:41.751
<i>I took Betsy to Charles' Coffee Shop
on Columbus Circle.</i>

285
00:23:42.796 --> 00:23:47.381
<i>I had black coffee and apple pie
with a slice of melted yellow cheese.</i>

286
00:23:47.593 --> 00:23:49.834
<i>I think that was a good selection.</i>

287
00:23:50.054 --> 00:23:52.386
<i>Betsy had coffee
and a fruit salad dish.</i>

288
00:23:52.598 --> 00:23:54.509
<i>She could've had anything she wanted.</i>

289
00:23:54.725 --> 00:23:57.433
Fifteen thousand volunteers
in New York alone's not bad.

290
00:23:57.686 --> 00:23:59.472
But, Christ,
the organizational problems.

291
00:23:59.688 --> 00:24:01.099
Mm-hm.

292
00:24:01.565 --> 00:24:04.603
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I got the same problems.

293
00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:09.900
I gotta get organized. Little things,
like my apartment, my possessions.

294
00:24:10.699 --> 00:24:14.533
Need a sign that says, "One of
these days, I'm gonna get organiz-ized."

295
00:24:14.787 --> 00:24:16.403
You mean "organized"?

296
00:24:16.622 --> 00:24:18.488
Organiz-ized.

297
00:24:18.749 --> 00:24:21.161
Organiz-ized. It's a joke.

298
00:24:22.044 --> 00:24:24.627
O-R-G-A-N-E-Z-I-E-Z-D.

299
00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:29.124
You mean "organiz-ize." Like those little
signs in offices that say, "Thimk."

300
00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:36.718
Do you like the place you work in?

301
00:24:38.143 --> 00:24:42.057
Got good people working for us. And
I think Palantine's got a good chance.

302
00:24:46.193 --> 00:24:48.275
You know you have beautiful eyes?

303
00:24:54.868 --> 00:24:56.950
Do you like the guy you work with?

304
00:24:57.204 --> 00:24:58.786
He's okay.

305
00:25:00.457 --> 00:25:02.039
Yeah, I know. But do you like him?

306
00:25:02.543 --> 00:25:07.003
Well, he's funny, he's good at his job.
Though he does have a few problems.

307
00:25:07.214 --> 00:25:09.376
I would say
he has quite a few problems.

308
00:25:11.135 --> 00:25:14.173
His energy seems to go
in the wrong places.

309
00:25:14.805 --> 00:25:17.593
When I walked in and I saw
you two sitting there...

310
00:25:17.808 --> 00:25:19.594
could tell by the way you were relating

311
00:25:19.685 --> 00:25:22.268
that there was no connection whatsoever.

312
00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:25.730
And I felt when I walked in,
there was something between us.

313
00:25:25.983 --> 00:25:28.645
There was an impulse
that we were both following.

314
00:25:28.902 --> 00:25:31.564
So that gave me the right
to come in and talk to you.

315
00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:35.523
Otherwise, I never would've felt that
I had the right to say anything to you.

316
00:25:35.784 --> 00:25:38.742
I never would've had
the courage to talk to you.

317
00:25:39.663 --> 00:25:42.121
And with him, I felt there was nothing
and I could sense it.

318
00:25:42.332 --> 00:25:45.415
And when I walked in, I knew
I was right. Did you feel that way?

319
00:25:49.006 --> 00:25:51.293
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

320
00:25:53.635 --> 00:25:54.875
Where are you from?

321
00:25:55.471 --> 00:25:56.586
Upstate.

322
00:26:00.684 --> 00:26:02.404
That fellow you work with,
I don't like him.

323
00:26:02.519 --> 00:26:05.511
Not that I don't like him,
I just think he's silly.

324
00:26:07.983 --> 00:26:10.224
I don't think he respects you.

325
00:26:11.361 --> 00:26:14.479
I don't believe I've ever met
anyone quite like you.

326
00:26:25.834 --> 00:26:27.541
You wanna go to...

327
00:26:28.879 --> 00:26:30.540
a movie with me?

328
00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:33.130
- I have to go back to work now.
- I don't mean now.

329
00:26:33.258 --> 00:26:35.044
I mean, like, another time, though?

330
00:26:41.475 --> 00:26:44.012
Sure. You know what
you remind me of?

331
00:26:44.937 --> 00:26:47.349
- What?
- That song...

332
00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:51.607
by Kris Kristofferson.

333
00:26:54.238 --> 00:26:57.196
- Who's that?
- The songwriter.

334
00:26:57.407 --> 00:26:58.943
"He's a prophet...

335
00:26:59.201 --> 00:27:00.908
He's a prophet and a pusher...

336
00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:05.159
partly truth, partly fiction,
a walking contradiction.”

337
00:27:06.834 --> 00:27:08.245
You saying that about me?

338
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.167
Who else would I be talking about?

339
00:27:10.754 --> 00:27:12.461
I'm no pusher. I never have pushed.

340
00:27:13.924 --> 00:27:16.382
No, no, just the part
about the contradictions.

341
00:27:16.635 --> 00:27:18.421
You are that.

342
00:27:49.042 --> 00:27:52.831
<i>I called Betsy again, she said
maybe we'd go to a movie together...</i>

343
00:27:53.046 --> 00:27:55.959
<i>after she gets off work tomorrow.
That's my day off.</i>

344
00:27:56.216 --> 00:28:00.335
<i>At first she hesitated, but I called
her again and then she agreed.</i>

345
00:28:01.847 --> 00:28:03.508
<i>Betsy, Betsy. Oh, no.</i>

346
00:28:03.765 --> 00:28:06.427
<i>Betsy what?
I forgot to ask her last name again.</i>

347
00:28:06.643 --> 00:28:09.931
<i>Damn! I gotta remember stuff like that.</i>

348
00:28:21.074 --> 00:28:23.782
I don't think we have to worry
about anyone committing themselves...

349
00:28:23.994 --> 00:28:26.656
until things start coming in
from California.

350
00:28:26.914 --> 00:28:29.914
Listen, this is making me nervous. I
think we should've waited for the limo.

351
00:28:30.042 --> 00:28:31.874
I don't mind taking a cab, but I mind...

352
00:28:32.044 --> 00:28:35.787
going to California without the
right preparation. We'll get in trouble.

353
00:28:35.964 --> 00:28:38.046
Are you Charles Palantine,
the candidate?

354
00:28:39.843 --> 00:28:41.675
Yes, I am.

355
00:28:42.846 --> 00:28:44.302
I'm one of your biggest supporters.

356
00:28:44.473 --> 00:28:47.966
I tell everybody that comes in this taxi
that they have to vote for you.

357
00:28:48.393 --> 00:28:49.758
Why, thank you...

358
00:28:51.855 --> 00:28:52.890
Travis.

359
00:28:53.065 --> 00:28:56.023
I'm sure you're gonna win, sir.
Everybody I know's gonna vote for you.

360
00:28:56.235 --> 00:28:58.875
You know, in fact, I was gonna
put one of your stickers in my taxi.

361
00:28:58.904 --> 00:29:01.771
Company said it was against their
policy. But they don't know anything.

362
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:03.606
They're a bunch of jerks.

363
00:29:03.825 --> 00:29:06.658
Let me tell you something,
I have learned more about America...

364
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:10.079
from riding in taxicabs
than in all the limos in the country.

365
00:29:11.959 --> 00:29:14.792
- Oh, yeah?
- That's true.

366
00:29:15.295 --> 00:29:16.626
Can I ask you something, Travis?

367
00:29:16.797 --> 00:29:17.832
Sure.

368
00:29:18.048 --> 00:29:21.211
What is the one thing about this
country that bugs you the most?

369
00:29:22.928 --> 00:29:27.718
I don't know. I don't follow political
issues that closely. I don't know.

370
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:30.432
Oh, well, there must be something.

371
00:29:30.727 --> 00:29:34.812
Well, whatever it is, he should
clean up this city here...

372
00:29:35.023 --> 00:29:39.517
because this city here is like an
open sewer. It's full of filth and scum.

373
00:29:39.987 --> 00:29:41.819
Sometimes I can hardly take it.

374
00:29:42.072 --> 00:29:44.032
Whatever ever becomes
the president should just...

375
00:29:45.742 --> 00:29:47.779
really clean it up. Know what I mean?

376
00:29:48.036 --> 00:29:51.654
Sometimes I go out and I smell it.
I get headaches, it's so bad.

377
00:29:51.873 --> 00:29:54.956
And they just like... They just
never go away, you know?

378
00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:57.542
I think that the
president should just...

379
00:29:58.046 --> 00:30:02.540
clean up this mess here. He should
flush it right down the fucking toilet.

380
00:30:08.432 --> 00:30:10.389
Well, uh...

381
00:30:10.559 --> 00:30:13.176
I think I know what you mean, Travis.

382
00:30:13.603 --> 00:30:15.435
But it's not gonna be easy.

383
00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:19.106
- We'll have to make radical changes.
- Damn straight.

384
00:30:20.652 --> 00:30:22.518
Here you go, Travis. Keep the change.

385
00:30:22.738 --> 00:30:24.024
Thank you.

386
00:30:27.534 --> 00:30:29.804
- Nice talking to you, Travis.
- Nice talking to you, sir.

387
00:30:29.828 --> 00:30:32.160
You're a good man.
I know you're gonna win.

388
00:30:32.539 --> 00:30:34.371
Thank you. Drive safe.

389
00:30:56.938 --> 00:30:59.475
Come on, man.
Get me out of here, all right?

390
00:31:02.903 --> 00:31:04.689
Come on!

391
00:31:05.489 --> 00:31:07.196
Come on, baby. This is a real drag.

392
00:31:07.449 --> 00:31:10.032
Now, come on!
Come on, don't make no scene.

393
00:31:11.787 --> 00:31:13.118
You wanna get busted?

394
00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:14.616
Now, bitch, be cool!

395
00:31:23.465 --> 00:31:25.581
Don't start no trouble.

396
00:31:26.802 --> 00:31:28.759
Cabbie, just forget
about this. It's nothing.

397
00:31:29.012 --> 00:31:30.218
Be cool, bitch!

398
00:31:39.231 --> 00:31:42.474
- Stop!
- Wanna hear something?

399
00:31:48.115 --> 00:31:50.026
What's the matter, baby?

400
00:32:24.484 --> 00:32:26.395
Get your ass out of here!

401
00:33:35.388 --> 00:33:37.846
- Hi there.
- Hi.

402
00:33:38.725 --> 00:33:41.342
- Have a nice day today?
- Not particularly.

403
00:33:41.561 --> 00:33:43.222
- I got a present for you.
- Oh!

404
00:33:47.484 --> 00:33:51.148
Now back to Gene Krupa's
syncopated style shortly.

405
00:33:59.287 --> 00:34:00.527
Why'd you do that?

406
00:34:00.747 --> 00:34:03.660
What else am I gonna do with my money?

407
00:34:04.042 --> 00:34:06.158
I wish you'd have listened to this.

408
00:34:06.753 --> 00:34:09.745
Well, I would have, except my
record player doesn't work now.

409
00:34:10.006 --> 00:34:11.212
- Your stereo's broken?
- Yeah.

410
00:34:11.466 --> 00:34:13.878
How can you stand it?
I couldn't live without music.

411
00:34:14.135 --> 00:34:17.753
I don't follow music too much, but
I would really like to. I really would.

412
00:34:18.014 --> 00:34:19.880
So then you haven't played
this record yet?

413
00:34:20.058 --> 00:34:21.548
No.

414
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:27.055
But I was thinking maybe we could
listen to it on your record player.

415
00:34:27.315 --> 00:34:30.979
Now, going back to
40 years of Chick Webb.

416
00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:48.746
You gotta be kidding.

417
00:34:48.962 --> 00:34:52.250
- What?
- This is a dirty movie.

418
00:34:52.841 --> 00:34:56.675
No, no. This is a movie
that a lot of couples come to.

419
00:34:56.886 --> 00:34:59.844
- All kinds of couples go here.
- You sure about that?

420
00:35:00.015 --> 00:35:03.724
Yeah. Yeah, I see them
all the time.

421
00:35:07.022 --> 00:35:08.103
Come on.

422
00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:48.764
Excuse me.

423
00:35:48.938 --> 00:35:50.303
Shut the fuck up.

424
00:35:50.565 --> 00:35:52.772
- Where are you going?
- I have to leave now.

425
00:35:53.026 --> 00:35:55.267
- Why?
- I don't know why I came in here.

426
00:35:55.528 --> 00:35:57.769
- I don't like these movies.
- Well, I mean...

427
00:35:58.031 --> 00:36:00.898
I didn't know you'd feel
that way about this movie.

428
00:36:01.159 --> 00:36:04.026
- If I had known...
- These the only movies you go to?

429
00:36:04.287 --> 00:36:07.245
Yeah, I mean I come and...
This is not so bad.

430
00:36:07.415 --> 00:36:11.283
Taking me to a place like this
is like saying, "Let's fuck."

431
00:36:14.255 --> 00:36:18.294
Uh, there are other places
I can take you.

432
00:36:18.468 --> 00:36:21.631
I don't know much about them,
but I can take you other places.

433
00:36:22.097 --> 00:36:23.633
We're just different.

434
00:36:24.182 --> 00:36:26.423
- Wait a second. Wait a second.
- I have to go.

435
00:36:26.643 --> 00:36:27.849
- I've gotta go now.
- Wait.

436
00:36:28.061 --> 00:36:31.679
- Wait a second, I wanna talk to you.
- Look, I have to go.

437
00:36:32.315 --> 00:36:33.396
Taxi!

438
00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:37.769
Can I talk to you? Won't you at least
talk to me? I didn't know you'd...

439
00:36:37.946 --> 00:36:39.311
Look, won't you take the record?

440
00:36:39.531 --> 00:36:41.863
- I've already got it.
- But, please.

441
00:36:42.117 --> 00:36:46.076
- I bought it for you, Betsy.
- Thanks, now I've got two. Let's go.

442
00:36:46.287 --> 00:36:47.994
Can I call you?

443
00:36:49.207 --> 00:36:51.323
Jesus Christ, I got a taxi.

444
00:36:57.257 --> 00:36:58.793
Hello, Betsy.

445
00:36:59.008 --> 00:37:00.715
Hi, it's Travis.

446
00:37:02.595 --> 00:37:05.553
How you doing? Listen,
I'm sorry about the other night.

447
00:37:05.807 --> 00:37:08.845
I didn't know that was
the way you felt about it.

448
00:37:10.729 --> 00:37:15.724
Well, I didn't know. If I... I would
have taken you somewhere else.

449
00:37:16.985 --> 00:37:19.067
Are you feeling better or...?

450
00:37:19.988 --> 00:37:23.652
Maybe you had a virus or
something. A 24-hour virus, you know.

451
00:37:23.908 --> 00:37:26.149
It can happen. Yeah.

452
00:37:27.746 --> 00:37:29.612
You, uh...

453
00:37:30.915 --> 00:37:33.452
You've been working hard, huh? Yeah.

454
00:37:37.505 --> 00:37:40.793
Would you like to have
some dinner with me...

455
00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:43.667
in the next few days or something?

456
00:37:46.681 --> 00:37:48.297
How about just a cup of coffee?

457
00:37:48.558 --> 00:37:52.643
I could come by the headquarters
or something, and we could...

458
00:37:53.521 --> 00:37:55.353
Okay, okay.

459
00:37:57.942 --> 00:38:00.559
Did you get my flowers in the...?

460
00:38:02.489 --> 00:38:06.824
You didn't get them?
But I sent some flowers.

461
00:38:10.538 --> 00:38:13.121
Yeah. Well... Okay, okay.

462
00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:15.373
Can I call you again?

463
00:38:15.794 --> 00:38:18.331
Tomorrow or the next day? Okay.

464
00:38:18.505 --> 00:38:21.418
No, I'm gonna...
Okay, yeah, sure. Okay.

465
00:38:21.716 --> 00:38:23.081
So long.

466
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:27.336
<i>I tried several times to call her...</i>

467
00:38:27.514 --> 00:38:31.428
<i>but after the first call, she
wouldn't come to the phone any longer.</i>

468
00:38:31.893 --> 00:38:34.260
<i>I also sent flowers, but with no luck.</i>

469
00:38:34.604 --> 00:38:37.096
<i>The smell of the flowers
only made me sicker.</i>

470
00:38:37.357 --> 00:38:41.851
<i>The headaches got worse.
I think I got stomach cancer.</i>

471
00:38:42.487 --> 00:38:44.569
<i>I shouldn't complain, though.</i>

472
00:38:45.073 --> 00:38:47.064
<i>You're only as healthy...</i>

473
00:38:47.951 --> 00:38:50.409
<i>You're only as healthy as you feel.</i>

474
00:38:51.746 --> 00:38:53.111
<i>You're only...</i>

475
00:38:53.373 --> 00:38:55.034
<i>as healthy...</i>

476
00:38:55.291 --> 00:38:56.656
<i>as...</i>

477
00:38:56.918 --> 00:38:58.454
<i>you...</i>

478
00:38:58.711 --> 00:39:00.042
<i>feel.</i>

479
00:39:10.431 --> 00:39:14.015
- Let's not have any trouble, okay?
- Why won't you talk to me?

480
00:39:14.227 --> 00:39:16.827
Why don't you answer my calls?
You think I don't know you're here?

481
00:39:16.938 --> 00:39:19.098
- Let's not have any trouble.
- You think I don't know?

482
00:39:19.148 --> 00:39:21.001
- Would you please leave?
- Take your hands off!

483
00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:23.187
I just want you to know that I know...

484
00:39:23.403 --> 00:39:25.861
Please, just leave.
This is no place to do this.

485
00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:27.145
Take your hands off me.

486
00:39:27.323 --> 00:39:28.968
- Take your hands off!
- Okay, then just leave.

487
00:39:28.992 --> 00:39:31.404
- Take them off!
- All right, just leave, then. Come on.

488
00:39:31.578 --> 00:39:35.196
You're in a hell! And you're gonna die
in hell like the rest of them.

489
00:39:35.415 --> 00:39:38.157
- There's a cop across the street.
- You're like the rest of them.

490
00:39:38.418 --> 00:39:40.705
Look, I'm calling the cop. Officer!

491
00:39:43.673 --> 00:39:45.084
Officer!

492
00:39:46.718 --> 00:39:50.052
Look, don't come around here,
because I'll call the police!

493
00:39:50.972 --> 00:39:55.967
<i>I realize now how much she's
just like the others, cold and distant.</i>

494
00:39:56.185 --> 00:39:57.846
<i>And many people are like that.</i>

495
00:39:58.062 --> 00:40:01.350
<i>Women for sure. They're like a union.</i>

496
00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:04.106
Yo, cab!

497
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:15.778
Okay, pull over to the curb over there.
Right over to the curb. Over there.

498
00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:19.872
No, no, don't... Don't...
Don't... Whoa, whoa!

499
00:40:20.043 --> 00:40:22.455
The fucking meter.
What are you doing?

500
00:40:22.962 --> 00:40:24.828
What are you doing with the meter?

501
00:40:25.048 --> 00:40:28.211
<i>Did I tell you to put...? Did I
tell you to do that with the meter?</i>

502
00:40:28.426 --> 00:40:30.463
Put the meter back.
Let the numbers go on.

503
00:40:30.637 --> 00:40:32.344
I don't care what I have to pay.

504
00:40:32.555 --> 00:40:36.173
I'm not getting out.
Put the meter back on.

505
00:40:36.351 --> 00:40:37.386
Put it down.

506
00:40:38.603 --> 00:40:41.766
Put it... That's right.
Put it... Put it down!

507
00:40:43.524 --> 00:40:44.889
That's right.

508
00:40:45.777 --> 00:40:48.269
Why are you writing? Don't write!

509
00:40:48.488 --> 00:40:49.978
Put the thing down. Just sit.

510
00:40:53.493 --> 00:40:56.576
I didn't tell you to write.
I just said, "Pull over to the curb."

511
00:40:56.871 --> 00:40:59.283
We pulled over to the curb.
We're gonna sit here.

512
00:41:01.084 --> 00:41:02.870
We're gonna sit.

513
00:41:21.562 --> 00:41:25.556
Cabbie, you see that light
up there? The window?

514
00:41:27.026 --> 00:41:29.393
The light? The window
up there in the second floor.

515
00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:35.983
The one that's closest
to the edge of the building.

516
00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:40.579
The light up in the window.
Second story.

517
00:41:42.083 --> 00:41:43.949
What are you, blind?

518
00:41:44.168 --> 00:41:45.784
Do you see the light?

519
00:41:46.462 --> 00:41:49.545
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you see it. Good.

520
00:41:51.634 --> 00:41:52.914
You see the woman in the window?

521
00:41:55.471 --> 00:41:58.179
Do you see the woman in the window?

522
00:42:00.226 --> 00:42:03.344
- Yeah.
- You see the woman. Good.

523
00:42:03.521 --> 00:42:06.434
I want you to see that woman
because that's my wife.

524
00:42:08.985 --> 00:42:10.817
But that's not my apartment.

525
00:42:13.573 --> 00:42:16.440
It's not my apartment.
You know who lives there, huh?

526
00:42:17.452 --> 00:42:21.036
I mean, you wouldn't know. I'm just
saying. But you know who lives there?

527
00:42:22.373 --> 00:42:23.955
A nigger lives there.

528
00:42:24.167 --> 00:42:26.033
How do you like that?

529
00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:35.208
And I'm g... I'm gonna kill her.

530
00:42:37.346 --> 00:42:40.304
There's nothing else.
I'm gonna kill her.

531
00:42:40.516 --> 00:42:43.634
Well, what do you think of that? Hm?

532
00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:46.477
I said, what do you think of that?

533
00:42:46.981 --> 00:42:48.392
Don't answer.

534
00:42:48.775 --> 00:42:50.857
You don't have to answer everything.

535
00:42:54.989 --> 00:42:57.777
I'm gonna kill her
with a .44 Magnum pistol.

536
00:42:58.659 --> 00:43:02.527
I have a .44 Magnum pistol.
I'm gonna kill her with that gun.

537
00:43:03.039 --> 00:43:06.532
Have you seen what a .44 Magnum pistol
can do to a woman's face?

538
00:43:06.709 --> 00:43:10.668
I mean, it'd fucking destroy it.
Just blow it right apart.

539
00:43:10.922 --> 00:43:13.163
That's what it can do to her face.

540
00:43:13.508 --> 00:43:16.626
Ever seen what it can do to
a woman's pussy? That you should see.

541
00:43:18.054 --> 00:43:21.718
What a .44 Magnum's gonna do
to a woman's pussy you should see.

542
00:43:28.689 --> 00:43:30.020
What's that?

543
00:43:30.274 --> 00:43:33.187
I know you must think
that I'm, you know...

544
00:43:33.402 --> 00:43:37.145
You must think I'm sick or something.
You must think I'm pretty sick.

545
00:43:38.032 --> 00:43:40.524
Right? You must think I'm pretty sick?

546
00:43:44.539 --> 00:43:48.203
Right? I bet you really think I'm sick,
right? You think I'm sick?

547
00:43:55.174 --> 00:43:56.756
You think I'm sick?

548
00:43:59.846 --> 00:44:03.464
You don't have to answer. I'm paying for
the ride. You don't have to answer.

549
00:44:05.268 --> 00:44:07.384
I picked up this midget, you know.

550
00:44:07.645 --> 00:44:10.137
He's very well-dressed, Italian suit...

551
00:44:10.398 --> 00:44:12.810
good-looking,
with a beautiful tall blond.

552
00:44:13.067 --> 00:44:15.559
- Was it a lady midget?
- No, the guy was a midget.

553
00:44:15.778 --> 00:44:18.065
- The blond was a lady.
- Oh, I got you.

554
00:44:18.322 --> 00:44:20.313
Those midgets are funny.

555
00:44:21.576 --> 00:44:23.658
- Sometimes I like to hold a midget.
- Yeah?

556
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:26.658
They're funny. They always
wanna sit in the front seat.

557
00:44:28.374 --> 00:44:32.163
Then I pick up these two fags.
They're going downtown.

558
00:44:34.297 --> 00:44:35.937
They're wearing these
rhinestone T-shirts.

559
00:44:36.007 --> 00:44:38.499
They start arguing, they start yelling.

560
00:44:38.759 --> 00:44:41.717
The other one says, "You bitch,"
and starts beating him on the head.

561
00:44:41.929 --> 00:44:44.421
I say, "Look, I don't care
what you do in the privacy...

562
00:44:44.682 --> 00:44:47.014
of your own home, behind closed doors.

563
00:44:47.226 --> 00:44:48.933
This is an American free country.

564
00:44:49.187 --> 00:44:52.646
We got a pursuit of happiness thing.
You're consenting, you're adult.

565
00:44:52.815 --> 00:44:58.527
But, you know, in my fucking cab,
don't go busting heads.

566
00:44:58.779 --> 00:45:01.942
- God loves you, do what you want."
- Tell them to go to California.

567
00:45:02.158 --> 00:45:06.823
In California, when two fags split up,
one's gotta pay the other one alimony.

568
00:45:08.206 --> 00:45:13.042
Not bad. They're way ahead
out there, you know? California.

569
00:45:13.252 --> 00:45:15.163
So I tell them to get out
of the fucking cab.

570
00:45:15.379 --> 00:45:17.996
One time, I saw a cop chase
this guy with one leg.

571
00:45:18.257 --> 00:45:21.340
- He was on crutches, you know.
- The cop?

572
00:45:21.552 --> 00:45:24.840
No, no, the dude he was chasing.
Fucking cops, they chase anything.

573
00:45:25.014 --> 00:45:28.507
- Hey, Travis.
- Hey, you got that 5 you owe me?

574
00:45:30.228 --> 00:45:33.937
My man is loaded. Loaded.

575
00:45:34.523 --> 00:45:38.812
I'd be broke if I hadn't caught me
some people from Ohio out at Kennedy.

576
00:45:39.028 --> 00:45:43.147
I took them into Manhattan by way
of Long Beach, tipped me $5.

577
00:45:43.407 --> 00:45:45.398
What's the action around?

578
00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:47.196
It's pretty slow.

579
00:45:48.496 --> 00:45:49.782
I'm shoving on.

580
00:45:50.873 --> 00:45:52.329
Hey, Wiz, wait.

581
00:45:53.209 --> 00:45:56.577
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Bye, Killer.

582
00:45:59.715 --> 00:46:01.706
Thank you. Night.

583
00:46:16.607 --> 00:46:19.099
- You put it down.
- You can have them all you want!

584
00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:21.692
Hey, don't be hitting my man!

585
00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:25.984
You better take your ass out, boy!

586
00:46:30.913 --> 00:46:31.948
Yeah?

587
00:46:32.123 --> 00:46:34.615
I know you and I ain't talked
too much, you know.

588
00:46:34.792 --> 00:46:37.705
But I figure you've been
around a lot, so you could...

589
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.412
Shoot, that's why
they call me the Wizard.

590
00:46:40.631 --> 00:46:41.917
I got...

591
00:46:42.717 --> 00:46:46.631
It's just that I got a... I got a...

592
00:46:46.804 --> 00:46:48.090
Things got you down?

593
00:46:48.889 --> 00:46:51.347
Yeah, happens to the best of them.

594
00:46:52.435 --> 00:46:55.052
Yeah, they got me real down. Real...

595
00:47:00.735 --> 00:47:02.146
I just wanna go out...

596
00:47:02.361 --> 00:47:06.525
and you know, like, really...
Really... Really do something.

597
00:47:08.576 --> 00:47:10.487
Taxi life, you mean?

598
00:47:11.746 --> 00:47:14.033
Yeah, well...

599
00:47:14.332 --> 00:47:16.118
No, it's...

600
00:47:17.376 --> 00:47:18.616
I don't know.

601
00:47:20.963 --> 00:47:23.000
I just wanna go out...

602
00:47:23.591 --> 00:47:25.673
I really...

603
00:47:26.594 --> 00:47:28.255
I really wanna...

604
00:47:28.596 --> 00:47:31.554
I got some bad ideas in my head.
I just...

605
00:47:33.601 --> 00:47:35.808
Look. Look at it this way.

606
00:47:36.937 --> 00:47:40.931
A man... A man takes a job, you know.

607
00:47:41.442 --> 00:47:42.978
And that job...

608
00:47:43.152 --> 00:47:45.018
I mean, like, that...

609
00:47:45.196 --> 00:47:47.608
You know, that becomes what he is.

610
00:47:47.907 --> 00:47:49.693
You know, like...

611
00:47:51.285 --> 00:47:53.868
You do a thing,
and that's what you are.

612
00:47:55.164 --> 00:47:58.907
I've been a cabbie for 17 years.
Ten years at night.

613
00:47:59.168 --> 00:48:02.001
And I still don't own my
own cab, you know. Why?

614
00:48:02.797 --> 00:48:06.961
<i>Because I don't want 0.
That must be what I want.</i>

615
00:48:07.176 --> 00:48:10.339
You know, to be on the night shift,
driving somebody else's cab.

616
00:48:10.554 --> 00:48:12.215
You understand?

617
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:16.216
You get a job, you become the job.

618
00:48:16.435 --> 00:48:19.973
One guy lives in Brooklyn,
one guy lives in Sutton Place.

619
00:48:20.189 --> 00:48:22.681
You get a lawyer,
another guy's a doctor.

620
00:48:22.942 --> 00:48:26.025
Another guy dies,
another guy gets well...

621
00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.027
and people are born.

622
00:48:28.239 --> 00:48:30.355
I envy you, your youth.

623
00:48:31.492 --> 00:48:34.985
Go out and get laid.
Get drunk. You know, do anything.

624
00:48:37.623 --> 00:48:40.615
You got no choice, anyway.
I mean, we're all fucked.

625
00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:44.536
More or less, you know?

626
00:48:48.467 --> 00:48:52.461
I don't know. That's about
the dumbest thing I ever heard.

627
00:48:54.098 --> 00:48:57.307
It's not Bertrand Russell,
but what do you want? I'm a cabbie.

628
00:48:57.476 --> 00:48:58.762
What do I know?

629
00:48:59.019 --> 00:49:01.852
I don't even know what the fuck
you're talking about.

630
00:49:02.064 --> 00:49:04.351
I don't know.
Maybe I don't know either.

631
00:49:05.568 --> 00:49:10.233
Don't worry so much. Relax,
Killer, you're gonna be all right.

632
00:49:10.489 --> 00:49:13.356
I know. I've seen a lot of people...

633
00:49:13.951 --> 00:49:16.739
- and I know.
- Okay.

634
00:49:16.912 --> 00:49:18.323
Okay. Thanks, man.

635
00:49:18.497 --> 00:49:21.865
I'll see you. I guess...

636
00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:27.288
Yeah, you know.
You're all right. You're all right.

637
00:49:45.316 --> 00:49:49.776
<i>What do you think of Goodwin's chances
in the upcoming primary?</i>

638
00:49:49.987 --> 00:49:51.569
<i>Well, Mr. Goodman is a fine man.</i>

639
00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:55.114
<i>I would certainly,
if it came to it, prefer him...</i>

640
00:49:55.451 --> 00:49:57.909
<i>to our opponent in the other party.</i>

641
00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:01.738
<i>I think that my programs
are better defined than his.</i>

642
00:50:01.999 --> 00:50:05.663
<i>More imaginative than his. Moreover,
I have a better chance of winning.</i>

643
00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:08.708
<i>It's academic, though. He's not
gonna win the primary. I am.</i>

644
00:50:08.964 --> 00:50:10.671
<i>I see.</i>

645
00:50:11.425 --> 00:50:14.258
<i>Well, one more thing
I'd like to ask you.</i>

646
00:50:14.512 --> 00:50:16.719
<i>How is your campaign going?
How do you feel it's going?</i>

647
00:50:16.972 --> 00:50:20.090
<i>When we came up with our slogan
"We are the people”...</i>

648
00:50:20.351 --> 00:50:22.592
<i>when I said "Let the people rule"...</i>

649
00:50:23.145 --> 00:50:25.682
<i>I felt I was being
somewhat overly optimistic.</i>

650
00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:29.478
<i>I must tell you that I am more
optimistic now than ever before.</i>

651
00:50:29.735 --> 00:50:33.603
<i>The people are rising to the demands
that I have made on them.</i>

652
00:50:33.822 --> 00:50:36.280
<i>The people are beginning to rule.</i>

653
00:50:36.492 --> 00:50:39.109
<i>I feel it is a groundswell. I know...</i>

654
00:50:39.328 --> 00:50:42.286
<i>it will continue through the primary.
I know it will continue at Miami.</i>

655
00:50:42.456 --> 00:50:45.244
<i>And I know it will rise...</i>

656
00:50:45.459 --> 00:50:48.167
<i>to an unprecedented swell in November.</i>

657
00:52:14.548 --> 00:52:16.664
That bitch, goddamn!
I'll blow her brains out!

658
00:52:16.884 --> 00:52:21.048
I'll kill her, goddamn it! I'm gonna
get my hands on her, I'll kill her!

659
00:52:21.263 --> 00:52:22.549
Shoot, goddamn it! Fucker!

660
00:52:22.723 --> 00:52:26.466
I swear if I get my hands on her,
I'll kill that fucking bitch!

661
00:52:28.312 --> 00:52:29.768
- Hey, Sport.
- Hey, Sport.

662
00:52:29.938 --> 00:52:32.145
I'll kill her! Damn it!

663
00:52:32.316 --> 00:52:35.399
- That guy keeps following us.
- Don't look at him.

664
00:52:51.627 --> 00:52:53.117
Hey, guys.

665
00:52:55.964 --> 00:52:58.626
- You wanna take a walk?
- Yeah.

666
00:53:10.729 --> 00:53:14.313
<i>Loneliness has followed me
my whole life, everywhere.</i>

667
00:53:14.692 --> 00:53:17.104
<i>In bars, in cars...</i>

668
00:53:17.486 --> 00:53:19.978
<i>sidewalks, stores, everywhere.</i>

669
00:53:21.115 --> 00:53:22.526
<i>There's no escape.</i>

670
00:53:22.991 --> 00:53:25.449
<i>I'm God's lonely man.</i>

671
00:53:29.498 --> 00:53:31.114
<i>June 8th.</i>

672
00:53:31.625 --> 00:53:34.037
<i>My life has taken another turn again.</i>

673
00:53:34.294 --> 00:53:37.753
<i>The days move along
with regularity, over and over...</i>

674
00:53:37.965 --> 00:53:40.502
<i>one day indistinguishable
from the next.</i>

675
00:53:40.759 --> 00:53:43.217
<i>A long, continuous chain.</i>

676
00:53:43.429 --> 00:53:45.261
<i>And then suddenly...</i>

677
00:53:45.514 --> 00:53:47.551
<i>there is a change.</i>

678
00:54:02.156 --> 00:54:05.069
Travis, this here's Easy Andy.
He's a traveling salesman.

679
00:54:05.284 --> 00:54:07.366
How you doing, Travis?

680
00:54:30.058 --> 00:54:32.800
- You got a .44 Magnum?
- It's an expensive weapon.

681
00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:35.057
That's all right. I got money.

682
00:54:35.272 --> 00:54:36.979
It's a real monster.

683
00:54:38.025 --> 00:54:41.768
Stop a car at 100 yards, put a round
right through the engine block.

684
00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:54.496
Here you go.

685
00:54:54.958 --> 00:54:57.541
It's a premium, high-resale weapon.

686
00:55:01.924 --> 00:55:03.255
Look at that.

687
00:55:04.885 --> 00:55:06.592
Look at that. That's a beauty.

688
00:55:11.391 --> 00:55:14.804
I could sell this gun to some
jungle bunny in Harlem for $500.

689
00:55:15.771 --> 00:55:18.889
But I just deal high-quality goods
to the right people.

690
00:55:20.317 --> 00:55:21.603
How about that?

691
00:55:22.402 --> 00:55:24.985
This might be a little too big
for practical purposes.

692
00:55:25.322 --> 00:55:29.657
In which case,
for you, I'd recommend .38 snub-nosed.

693
00:55:31.745 --> 00:55:33.076
Look at this.

694
00:55:35.290 --> 00:55:37.748
Look at that.
That's a beautiful little gun.

695
00:55:37.918 --> 00:55:40.159
It's nickel-plated with a snub-nose...

696
00:55:40.337 --> 00:55:42.795
otherwise the same
as a service revolver.

697
00:55:43.048 --> 00:55:45.255
That'll stop anything that moves.

698
00:55:45.425 --> 00:55:48.838
The Magnum, they use that
in Africa for killing elephants.

699
00:55:49.012 --> 00:55:52.255
That .38, that's a funny gun.

700
00:55:57.354 --> 00:55:59.595
Some of these guns are like toys.

701
00:55:59.815 --> 00:56:02.933
That .38, you go out and
hammer nails with it all day...

702
00:56:03.151 --> 00:56:06.439
come back and it'll cut
dead center on target every time.

703
00:56:06.864 --> 00:56:10.607
It's got a really nice action to it
and a heck of a wallop.

704
00:56:13.287 --> 00:56:15.028
You interested in an automatic?

705
00:56:15.706 --> 00:56:19.370
It's a Colt .25 automatic.
It's a nice little gun.

706
00:56:19.585 --> 00:56:20.791
It's a beautiful little gun.

707
00:56:21.003 --> 00:56:23.586
Holds six shots in the clip,
one shot in the chamber.

708
00:56:23.797 --> 00:56:25.879
If you're dumb enough
to put a round in the chamber.

709
00:56:27.384 --> 00:56:29.796
Here. Look at this.

710
00:56:30.012 --> 00:56:31.502
.380 Walther.

711
00:56:31.805 --> 00:56:33.967
Holds eight shots in the clip.

712
00:56:35.058 --> 00:56:37.095
That's a nice gun.

713
00:56:37.352 --> 00:56:39.810
That's a beautiful little gun.
Look at that.

714
00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:47.522
During World War ll, they used
this gun to replace the P 38.

715
00:56:48.322 --> 00:56:50.563
Just given out to officers.

716
00:56:56.330 --> 00:56:58.367
Ain't that a little honey?

717
00:57:07.382 --> 00:57:10.124
- How much for everything?
- All together?

718
00:57:10.344 --> 00:57:13.427
Well, only a jackass would carry
that cannon in the streets like that.

719
00:57:13.597 --> 00:57:14.928
Here.

720
00:57:15.515 --> 00:57:19.008
Here's a beautiful handmade
holster I had made in Mexico.

721
00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:21.101
Forty dollars.

722
00:57:21.855 --> 00:57:24.847
Three-fifty for the Magnum,
250 for the .38...

723
00:57:25.025 --> 00:57:28.643
one and a quarter for the .25,
150 for the .380.

724
00:57:29.029 --> 00:57:32.067
You take this and wait here.
I'll walk down with you.

725
00:57:32.991 --> 00:57:35.949
How about dope?
Grass? Hash? Coke?

726
00:57:36.161 --> 00:57:40.120
Mescaline? Downers? Nembutal?
Tuinal? Chloral hydrates?

727
00:57:40.374 --> 00:57:43.867
- How about uppers, amphetamines?
- No, I'm not interested in that stuff.

728
00:57:44.086 --> 00:57:46.748
I can get you crystal meth,
nitrous oxide.

729
00:57:47.005 --> 00:57:49.372
How about a Cadillac?
A brand-new Cadillac...

730
00:57:49.716 --> 00:57:51.423
with the pink slip, for 2 grand.

731
00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:01.550
<i>June 29th.</i>

732
00:58:02.396 --> 00:58:05.514
<i>I gotta get in shape now.
Too much sitting has ruined my body.</i>

733
00:58:05.691 --> 00:58:08.274
<i>Too much abuse has gone on
for too long.</i>

734
00:58:08.527 --> 00:58:10.939
<i>From now on, it'll be
50 pushups each morning.</i>

735
00:58:11.405 --> 00:58:14.272
<i>Fifty pull-ups.
There will be no more pills.</i>

736
00:58:14.533 --> 00:58:18.652
<i>There will be no more bad food,
no more destroyers of my body.</i>

737
00:58:19.246 --> 00:58:22.955
<i>From now on, it'll be total
organization. Every muscle must be tight.</i>

738
00:58:38.098 --> 00:58:39.839
<i>Wow.</i>

739
00:58:40.017 --> 00:58:45.057
<i>Look at the size of that.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.</i>

740
00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:47.437
<i>Oh, it looks so good.</i>

741
00:58:52.821 --> 00:58:57.236
<i>It's getting harder and harder,
and it's throbbing now.</i>

742
00:58:58.785 --> 00:59:02.779
<i>The idea had been growing
in my brain for some time.</i>

743
00:59:03.665 --> 00:59:05.121
<i>True force.</i>

744
00:59:05.333 --> 00:59:09.952
<i>All the king's men cannot
put it back together again.</i>

745
01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:10.518
- Where do we get more of these?
- Where do you think? At headquarters.

746
01:01:10.542 --> 01:01:14.410
- Where do we get more of these?
- Where do you think? At headquarters.

747
01:01:14.629 --> 01:01:16.791
All the way back there?

748
01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:18.213
- Come on.
- They'll work.

749
01:01:18.466 --> 01:01:21.128
- Maybe it's these speakers.
- I've done this 100 times.

750
01:01:21.386 --> 01:01:23.865
- You've done this before?
- I've done this before, don't worry.

751
01:01:23.889 --> 01:01:26.756
- When was the last time you did this?
- I've never done this before.

752
01:01:26.975 --> 01:01:28.465
Betsy!

753
01:01:28.852 --> 01:01:30.889
- Betsy!
- What?!

754
01:01:31.605 --> 01:01:34.643
Betsy. Come here, come here.

755
01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:30.531
Hey.

756
01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:35.328
Hey, you're a Secret Service man,
aren't you?

757
01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:37.200
Huh?

758
01:02:37.504 --> 01:02:39.495
Just waiting for the senator.

759
01:02:40.382 --> 01:02:42.669
You're waiting for the senator?

760
01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:44.712
Oh...

761
01:02:46.471 --> 01:02:48.712
That's a very good answer.

762
01:02:48.974 --> 01:02:51.181
Shit, man.

763
01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:53.391
I'm waiting for the sun to shine.

764
01:02:54.062 --> 01:02:55.769
Yeah.

765
01:02:56.231 --> 01:02:59.940
No, the reason I asked if you were
a Secret Service man...

766
01:03:00.193 --> 01:03:01.729
I won't say anything.

767
01:03:01.987 --> 01:03:03.477
Is because I...

768
01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:09.782
I saw some suspicious-looking
people over there.

769
01:03:10.036 --> 01:03:12.198
- You did?
- Yeah, they were right over there.

770
01:03:17.711 --> 01:03:19.952
They were just here.

771
01:03:23.341 --> 01:03:25.457
They were very, very...

772
01:03:25.719 --> 01:03:28.051
- Suspicious.
- Yeah.

773
01:03:30.765 --> 01:03:33.052
Where'd he go?

774
01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:36.052
Is it hard to get to be in
the Secret Service?

775
01:03:36.229 --> 01:03:37.310
Why?

776
01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:40.438
Well, I was just curious,
because I think I'd be good at it.

777
01:03:40.734 --> 01:03:42.475
I'm very observant.

778
01:03:42.736 --> 01:03:45.398
I was in the Marine Corps, you know.

779
01:03:45.739 --> 01:03:47.730
I'm good with crowds.

780
01:03:50.076 --> 01:03:53.569
I noticed your little pin there.
That's like a signal, isn't it?

781
01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:54.865
Sort of.

782
01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:59.159
A signal. A secret signal
for a Secret Service.

783
01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:04.580
Hey, what kind of guns you guys carry?

784
01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:09.836
.38s? .45s? .357 Magnums?
Something bigger, maybe?

785
01:04:10.096 --> 01:04:14.806
Look, if you're really interested,
if you give me your name and address...

786
01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:18.553
we'll send you all the information
on how to apply. How's that?

787
01:04:21.149 --> 01:04:22.230
- You will?
- Sure.

788
01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.936
Okay.

789
01:04:24.402 --> 01:04:25.858
Why not?

790
01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:31.281
My name is Henry...

791
01:04:32.827 --> 01:04:35.660
Krinkle. K-R-I-N-K-L-E.

792
01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:42.960
154 Hopper Avenue.

793
01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:45.295
- "Hopper"?
- Yeah.

794
01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:50.633
You know, like a rabbit? Hip, hop.
Heh, heh.

795
01:04:53.306 --> 01:04:55.297
Fair Lawn, New Jersey.

796
01:04:58.061 --> 01:04:59.142
Is there a zip code?

797
01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:02.354
Yeah, 6-1-0-4-5-2.

798
01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:08.352
- Okay?
- That's six digits. 6, 1...

799
01:05:09.489 --> 01:05:12.527
Oh, well, 6-1-0-4-5.

800
01:05:13.034 --> 01:05:14.820
Okay.

801
01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:18.112
I was thinking of my telephone number.

802
01:05:18.373 --> 01:05:19.454
Well, I've got it all.

803
01:05:19.666 --> 01:05:22.408
Henry, we'll get all the
stuff right out to you.

804
01:05:22.669 --> 01:05:26.128
Thanks a lot. Hey, great.
Thanks a lot. Hell. Jesus.

805
01:05:26.339 --> 01:05:28.171
- Be careful today.
- Right. Will do.

806
01:05:28.383 --> 01:05:32.593
You have to be careful around
a place like this. Bye.

807
01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.227
Damn it!

808
01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:05.996
Yeah.

809
01:06:06.921 --> 01:06:08.082
Huh?

810
01:06:08.256 --> 01:06:09.838
Huh? Huh?

811
01:06:10.008 --> 01:06:13.251
I'm faster than you, you fucking sick...

812
01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:16.178
I saw you coming, you fuck.

813
01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:18.050
Shitheel.

814
01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:24.391
I'm standing here.
You make the move.

815
01:06:24.606 --> 01:06:26.267
You make the move.

816
01:06:26.691 --> 01:06:28.398
It's your move.

817
01:06:31.446 --> 01:06:33.653
Don't try it, you fuck.

818
01:06:40.205 --> 01:06:41.991
You talking to me?

819
01:06:43.958 --> 01:06:46.165
You talking to me?

820
01:06:47.962 --> 01:06:49.919
You talking to me?

821
01:06:52.175 --> 01:06:55.543
Well, then who the hell else are
you talking to? You talking to me?

822
01:06:56.054 --> 01:06:58.045
Well, I'm the only one here.

823
01:06:59.807 --> 01:07:03.266
Who the fuck do you
think you're talking to?

824
01:07:03.561 --> 01:07:06.519
Oh, yeah? Huh?

825
01:07:07.148 --> 01:07:08.934
Okay.

826
01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:12.434
Huh?

827
01:07:16.241 --> 01:07:18.608
<i>Listen, you fuckers, you screwheads.</i>

828
01:07:18.826 --> 01:07:21.363
<i>Here is a man who would not
take it anymore.</i>

829
01:07:21.621 --> 01:07:23.737
<i>Who would not let...</i>

830
01:07:23.998 --> 01:07:26.831
<i>Listen, you fuckers, you screwheads.</i>

831
01:07:27.085 --> 01:07:30.498
<i>Here is a man who would not
take it anymore.</i>

832
01:07:30.755 --> 01:07:32.792
<i>A man who stood up against the scum...</i>

833
01:07:33.007 --> 01:07:35.374
<i>the cunts, the dogs,
the filth, the shit.</i>

834
01:07:35.552 --> 01:07:38.635
<i>Here is someone who stood up.</i>

835
01:07:39.472 --> 01:07:40.507
<i>Here is...</i>

836
01:07:40.848 --> 01:07:42.634
Huh?

837
01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:47.014
You're dead.

838
01:08:13.715 --> 01:08:14.750
Hey, Travis.

839
01:08:16.134 --> 01:08:17.545
Hi, Melio.

840
01:08:28.313 --> 01:08:29.428
Yeah, man?

841
01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:33.774
Shut your mouth and give me
the cash. Come on! Come on!

842
01:08:34.027 --> 01:08:36.815
- Let's go. Give me the damn cash.
- Don't shoot.

843
01:08:37.030 --> 01:08:39.237
Stop taking so long. Come on!

844
01:08:39.449 --> 01:08:41.907
Let me have it. Give me the bread.

845
01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:43.700
- This all you got?
- That's it.

846
01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:46.202
I don't have any more money, man.

847
01:08:46.414 --> 01:08:48.200
- That's all I got!
- You got more.

848
01:08:48.458 --> 01:08:49.789
I tell you, I got no money!

849
01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:51.479
Reach in your sock.
You got more bread.

850
01:08:51.628 --> 01:08:53.619
- Give me the rest of the bread.
- Hey. Hey.

851
01:08:59.177 --> 01:09:01.589
- Did you get him?
- Yeah, I got him.

852
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:08.550
Shit, man.

853
01:09:10.563 --> 01:09:13.305
- Is he dead?
- I don't know. His eyes are moving.

854
01:09:19.405 --> 01:09:22.818
I ain't got a permit for this thing.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

855
01:09:27.622 --> 01:09:29.502
Don't worry about it, man.
I'll take care of it.

856
01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:32.407
- Can I give you some money?
- No, man, just get out of here.

857
01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:35.161
No, man. I'll take care of it.
Go ahead.

858
01:09:38.925 --> 01:09:41.838

<i>Walt Whitman,
that great American poet...</i>

870
01:11:30.369 --> 01:11:32.360
<i>Spoke for all of us when he said:</i>

871
01:11:32.663 --> 01:11:35.371
<i>"I am the man. I suffered.</i>

872
01:11:35.541 --> 01:11:38.750
<i>I was there." Today I say to you:</i>

873
01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:42.371
<i>We are the people. We suffered.</i>

874
01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:44.043
<i>We were there.</i>

875
01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:50.383
<i>We, the people, suffered in Vietnam.</i>

876
01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:53.715
<i>We, the people, suffered.
We still suffer...</i>

877
01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:56.718
<i>from unemployment, inflation...</i>

878
01:11:56.979 --> 01:11:58.970
<i>crime and corruption.</i>

879
01:12:02.401 --> 01:12:04.187
<i>Dear Father and Mother...</i>

880
01:12:04.403 --> 01:12:06.735
<i>July is the month I remember...</i>

881
01:12:06.906 --> 01:12:10.149
<i>which brings not only
your wedding anniversary...</i>

882
01:12:10.368 --> 01:12:13.577
<i>but also Father's Day
and Mother's birthday.</i>

883
01:12:13.788 --> 01:12:16.701
<i>I'm sorry I can't remember
the exact dates...</i>

884
01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:20.910
<i>but I hope this card
will take care of them all.</i>

885
01:12:21.212 --> 01:12:24.330
<i>I'm sorry, again, I cannot
send you my address...</i>

886
01:12:24.549 --> 01:12:27.007
<i>like I promised to last year.</i>

887
01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:30.009
<i>But the sensitive nature of my work
for the government...</i>

888
01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:32.420
<i>demands utmost secrecy.</i>

889
01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:34.756
<i>I know you will understand.</i>

890
01:12:36.686 --> 01:12:39.098
<i>I am healthy and well
and making lots of money.</i>

891
01:12:39.313 --> 01:12:41.600
<i>I have been going with a girl
for several months...</i>

892
01:12:41.858 --> 01:12:44.441
<i>and I know you would be proud
if you could see her.</i>

893
01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:48.770
<i>Her name is Betsy, but I can tell
you no more than that.</i>

894
01:12:48.948 --> 01:12:51.315
Hey, cabbie, you can't park here.

895
01:12:53.035 --> 01:12:56.403
Come on! Come on, let's go!
Let's go! Move it!

896
01:12:58.624 --> 01:13:02.242
<i>Bear the burden
of suffering for the few.</i>

897
01:13:02.461 --> 01:13:05.795
<i>No more will we fight the wars
of the few...</i>

898
01:13:05.965 --> 01:13:08.297
<i>through the heart of the many.</i>

899
01:13:12.138 --> 01:13:16.223
<i>I hope this card finds you
all well, as it does me.</i>

900
01:13:16.434 --> 01:13:19.802
<i>I hope no one has died.
Don't worry about me.</i>

901
01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:23.430
<i>One day there will be a knock
on the door and it'll be me.</i>

902
01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:26.224
<i>Love, Travis.</i>

903
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:34.657
<i>Don't you have some idea?</i>

904
01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:36.652
<i>I'm not the one who wants to talk.</i>

905
01:13:36.913 --> 01:13:40.907
<i>But you must know that the
reason that I didn't marry him...</i>

906
01:13:41.125 --> 01:13:44.993
<i>is because I couldn't stand
to be a cause of divorce.</i>

907
01:13:47.673 --> 01:13:51.132
<i>Now he's getting a divorce anyway.</i>

908
01:13:54.889 --> 01:13:57.301
<i>Phillip wants to marry me, Brock.</i>

909
01:14:00.603 --> 01:14:02.685
<i>I do love him.</i>

910
01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:08.358
<i>What about us, June?</i>

911
01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:11.694
<i>Our marriage?</i>

912
01:14:14.492 --> 01:14:16.483
<i>You gotta know that
our marriage wasn't legal.</i>

913
01:14:16.702 --> 01:14:19.820
<i>In the eyes of God, we are married.</i>

914
01:14:22.041 --> 01:14:26.330
<i>Brock, please don't do this to me.</i>

915
01:14:28.714 --> 01:14:29.829
<i>I love him so...</i>

916
01:14:39.058 --> 01:14:40.674
Damn.

917
01:14:42.228 --> 01:14:44.219
Goddamn!

918
01:15:18.723 --> 01:15:20.760
They trying to get in the picture.

919
01:15:25.062 --> 01:15:27.599
- You looking for some action?
- Yeah.

920
01:15:30.776 --> 01:15:34.235
- You see that guy over there?
- Yeah.

921
01:15:34.405 --> 01:15:36.567
You go talk to him.
His name is Matthew.

922
01:15:36.782 --> 01:15:39.945
- I'll be over there waiting for you.
- Okay.

923
01:15:43.789 --> 01:15:47.202
Your name Matthew?
I want some action.

924
01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:49.121
Officer.

925
01:15:50.421 --> 01:15:54.289
I swear I'm clean. I'm just
waiting here for a friend.

926
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:56.791
You gonna bust me for nothing, man?

927
01:15:57.053 --> 01:15:59.385
I'm not a cop. I ain't a...

928
01:15:59.597 --> 01:16:01.804
Then why are you asking me for action?

929
01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:06.384
Because she sent me over.

930
01:16:08.647 --> 01:16:11.435
I suppose that ain't a .38
you've got in your sock.

931
01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:13.266
A .38?

932
01:16:14.987 --> 01:16:17.729
I'm clean, man.

933
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:20.652
- Shit, you're a real cowboy?
- Yeah.

934
01:16:20.826 --> 01:16:24.319
That's nice, man.
All right. That's all right.

935
01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:28.289
Fifteen dollars, 15 minutes.
Twenty-five dollars, half an hour.

936
01:16:29.919 --> 01:16:31.409
Shit.

937
01:16:31.796 --> 01:16:33.036
A cowboy, huh?

938
01:16:34.673 --> 01:16:37.005
I once had a horse.
In Coney Island.

939
01:16:37.259 --> 01:16:38.920
She got hit by a car.

940
01:16:41.472 --> 01:16:43.304
Well, take it or leave it.

941
01:16:43.516 --> 01:16:46.634
If you wanna save yourself
some money, don't fuck her.

942
01:16:46.811 --> 01:16:48.731
Because you'll be back here
every night for more.

943
01:16:48.813 --> 01:16:52.681
She's 12 and a half years old.
You ain't never had no pussy like that.

944
01:16:53.567 --> 01:16:55.604
Do anything you want.
Come on her...

945
01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:58.687
fuck her in the mouth,
in the ass. Come on her face.

946
01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:02.282
She'll get your cock so hard,
she'll make it explode.

947
01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:07.704
But no rough stuff. All right?

948
01:17:12.545 --> 01:17:14.377
All right, I'll take it.

949
01:17:14.672 --> 01:17:18.210
Hey, man! Don't take out
no money over here.

950
01:17:18.384 --> 01:17:19.624
You wanna fuck me?

951
01:17:19.885 --> 01:17:22.877
You ain't gonna fuck me. You're gonna
fuck her, you give her the money.

952
01:17:24.348 --> 01:17:25.884
Catch you later, copper.

953
01:17:27.184 --> 01:17:29.391
- What'd you say?
- I'll see you later, copper.

954
01:17:31.689 --> 01:17:32.895
I'm no cop, man.

955
01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:37.518
Well, if you are,
it's entrapment already.

956
01:17:38.696 --> 01:17:40.562
Huh?

957
01:17:40.739 --> 01:17:41.854
I'm hip.

958
01:17:43.033 --> 01:17:45.240
Funny, you don't look hip.

959
01:17:49.206 --> 01:17:51.698
Go ahead. Have yourself
a good time. Go ahead, man.

960
01:18:00.509 --> 01:18:02.546
You're a funny guy.

961
01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:07.763
But looks aren't everything.

962
01:18:08.184 --> 01:18:10.050
Go ahead, man. Have a good time.

963
01:18:15.232 --> 01:18:17.269
You're a funny guy.

964
01:18:57.316 --> 01:18:58.977
Hey.

965
01:18:59.276 --> 01:19:01.438
The room'll cost you 10 bucks.

966
01:19:14.458 --> 01:19:16.324
I'm timing you too.

967
01:19:35.354 --> 01:19:36.936
Come on.

968
01:19:46.365 --> 01:19:48.106
Are you really 12 and a half?

969
01:19:50.369 --> 01:19:54.237
Listen, mister, it's your time.
Fifteen minutes ain't long.

970
01:19:56.792 --> 01:19:59.659
When that cigarette
burns out, your time is up.

971
01:20:03.757 --> 01:20:05.293
How old are you?

972
01:20:07.261 --> 01:20:09.047
You won't tell me?

973
01:20:09.471 --> 01:20:12.554
- What's your name?
- Easy.

974
01:20:12.766 --> 01:20:15.679
- That's not any kind of name.
- It's easy to remember.

975
01:20:15.894 --> 01:20:18.352
Yeah, but what's your real name?

976
01:20:18.731 --> 01:20:20.062
I don't like my real name.

977
01:20:20.399 --> 01:20:22.390
But what's your real name?

978
01:20:26.238 --> 01:20:27.649
Iris.

979
01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:30.160
Well, what's wrong with that?
That's a nice name.

980
01:20:30.743 --> 01:20:32.450
That's what you think.

981
01:20:39.626 --> 01:20:42.744
No, don't do that. Don't do that.
Don't you remember me?

982
01:20:43.756 --> 01:20:47.090
Remember when you got into
a taxi? It was a checkered taxi.

983
01:20:47.384 --> 01:20:49.421
You got in and that guy
Matthew came by...

984
01:20:49.636 --> 01:20:52.094
and he said he wanted to take you away.

985
01:20:52.389 --> 01:20:53.424
He pulled you away.

986
01:20:55.601 --> 01:20:56.807
I don't remember that.

987
01:20:58.395 --> 01:21:01.262
- You don't remember any of that?
- No.

988
01:21:02.608 --> 01:21:04.144
I'm gonna get you out of here.

989
01:21:04.443 --> 01:21:06.650
Listen, we better make it
or Sport'll get mad.

990
01:21:06.904 --> 01:21:09.942
- How do you wanna make it?
- I don't wanna make it. Who's Sport?

991
01:21:10.157 --> 01:21:12.945
That's Matthew. I call him Sport.

992
01:21:17.998 --> 01:21:19.989
Wanna make it like this?

993
01:21:25.964 --> 01:21:27.295
Listen, I...

994
01:21:27.466 --> 01:21:28.956
Can't you understand something?

995
01:21:29.218 --> 01:21:32.802
You came into my cab. You're the one
that wanted to get out of here.

996
01:21:33.013 --> 01:21:34.469
Well, I must've been stoned.

997
01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:38.303
- Why? They drug you?
- Oh, come off it, man.

998
01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:41.931
What are you doing?

999
01:21:42.147 --> 01:21:44.138
Don't you wanna make it?

1000
01:21:47.236 --> 01:21:49.477
No, I don't wanna make it.
I wanna help you.

1001
01:21:50.531 --> 01:21:52.317
Well, I could help you.

1002
01:21:56.954 --> 01:21:58.194
Damn, man!

1003
01:21:58.872 --> 01:22:00.488
Goddamn it!

1004
01:22:04.503 --> 01:22:07.666
Shit, man. What the hell's
the matter with you?

1005
01:22:08.549 --> 01:22:10.335
We don't have to make it, mister.

1006
01:22:10.551 --> 01:22:12.588
Goddamn it! Don't you
wanna get out of here?

1007
01:22:15.347 --> 01:22:18.009
Can't you understand why I came here?

1008
01:22:18.267 --> 01:22:20.508
I think I understand.

1009
01:22:22.187 --> 01:22:24.019
I tried to get into your cab
one night...

1010
01:22:24.189 --> 01:22:26.726
and now you wanna
come and take me away.

1011
01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:31.561
- Is that it?
- Yeah, but don't you wanna go?

1012
01:22:31.864 --> 01:22:35.698
- I can leave any time I want to.
- Then what about that one night?

1013
01:22:37.786 --> 01:22:39.868
Look, I was stoned.

1014
01:22:42.249 --> 01:22:44.490
That's why they stopped me.

1015
01:22:46.295 --> 01:22:49.208
When I'm not stoned
I got no place else to go.

1016
01:22:50.549 --> 01:22:52.415
So they just, uh...

1017
01:22:53.010 --> 01:22:55.126
protect me from myself.

1018
01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:02.425
Well...

1019
01:23:02.603 --> 01:23:04.059
I don't know.

1020
01:23:06.565 --> 01:23:08.897
I don't know. Okay, I tried.

1021
01:23:09.776 --> 01:23:12.108
Hey, look, I understand.

1022
01:23:12.404 --> 01:23:17.399
- And it means something, really.
- Yeah, well...

1023
01:23:18.035 --> 01:23:19.742
Well, look, can I see you again?

1024
01:23:19.912 --> 01:23:22.404
- That's not hard to do.
- I don't mean like that.

1025
01:23:22.623 --> 01:23:26.412
I mean, you know, regularly.
This is nothing for a person to do.

1026
01:23:26.919 --> 01:23:28.580
All right,
how about breakfast tomorrow?

1027
01:23:28.962 --> 01:23:30.794
- Tomorrow?
- I get up at about 1:00.

1028
01:23:31.048 --> 01:23:33.415
- One o'clock?
- One o'clock.

1029
01:23:35.969 --> 01:23:38.085
Well, I got a thing. I don't know...

1030
01:23:38.263 --> 01:23:39.628
Come on, do you want to or not?

1031
01:23:39.806 --> 01:23:41.797
Yeah, I want... Okay, all right.

1032
01:23:42.059 --> 01:23:43.549
- Okay, 1:00.
- One o'clock.

1033
01:23:43.769 --> 01:23:46.431
Okay. See you tomorrow.

1034
01:23:47.564 --> 01:23:50.602
Oh, Iris. My name is Travis.

1035
01:23:51.818 --> 01:23:53.934
Thanks a lot, Travis.

1036
01:23:55.614 --> 01:23:58.948
So long, Iris. See you tomorrow.

1037
01:24:00.285 --> 01:24:02.276
Sweet Iris.

1038
01:24:26.311 --> 01:24:28.143
This is yours.

1039
01:24:28.397 --> 01:24:29.979
Spend it right.

1040
01:24:35.362 --> 01:24:37.194
Come back anytime, cowboy.

1041
01:24:37.906 --> 01:24:39.237
I will.

1042
01:24:57.843 --> 01:25:00.676
Why do you want me
to go back to my parents?

1043
01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:02.385
I mean, they hate me.

1044
01:25:02.639 --> 01:25:05.882
Why do you think I split in the
first place? There ain't nothing there.

1045
01:25:06.184 --> 01:25:09.643
Yeah, but you can't live
like this. It's a hell.

1046
01:25:09.855 --> 01:25:11.687
A girl should live at home.

1047
01:25:12.524 --> 01:25:14.356
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?

1048
01:25:14.568 --> 01:25:16.354
What do you mean, "women's lib"?

1049
01:25:16.528 --> 01:25:19.395
You're a young girl.
You should be at home now.

1050
01:25:19.573 --> 01:25:21.735
You should be dressed up,
going out with boys.

1051
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:23.532
You should be going to school.

1052
01:25:23.744 --> 01:25:27.453
- You know, that kind of stuff.
- Oh, God, are you square.

1053
01:25:27.706 --> 01:25:29.697
Hey, I'm not square.
You're the one that's square.

1054
01:25:29.875 --> 01:25:31.741
You're full of shit, man.

1055
01:25:31.918 --> 01:25:34.205
What are you talking about?
You walk out with those...

1056
01:25:34.379 --> 01:25:37.019
fucking creeps and lowlifes
and degenerates out on the street...

1057
01:25:37.049 --> 01:25:40.417
and you sell your little
pussy for nothing, man?

1058
01:25:40.677 --> 01:25:42.543
For some lowlife pimp?

1059
01:25:42.804 --> 01:25:44.886
Stands in a hall.

1060
01:25:46.183 --> 01:25:49.096
I'm the...? I'm square?
You're the one that's square, man.

1061
01:25:49.394 --> 01:25:52.728
I don't go screw and fuck with a bunch
of killers and junkies like you do.

1062
01:25:53.774 --> 01:25:55.731
You call that being hip?

1063
01:25:56.568 --> 01:25:58.400
What world you from?

1064
01:26:03.325 --> 01:26:06.408
- Who's a killer?
- That guy Sport's a killer.

1065
01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:08.076
Sport never killed nobody.

1066
01:26:08.288 --> 01:26:09.744
- He killed...
- He's a Libra.

1067
01:26:09.956 --> 01:26:11.117
He's a what?

1068
01:26:11.333 --> 01:26:14.701
I'm a Libra too.
That's why we get along so well.

1069
01:26:17.130 --> 01:26:19.747
He looks like a killer to me.

1070
01:26:19.966 --> 01:26:23.630
I think that Cancers
make the best lovers...

1071
01:26:24.221 --> 01:26:26.087
but, God, my whole family
are air signs.

1072
01:26:26.264 --> 01:26:27.470
He's also a dope-shooter.

1073
01:26:28.433 --> 01:26:31.642
So, what makes you so high
and mighty? Will you tell me that?

1074
01:26:32.104 --> 01:26:35.017
Didn't you ever try looking at
your own eyeballs in the mirror?

1075
01:26:41.113 --> 01:26:43.445
So, what are you gonna
do about Sport and that old bastard?

1076
01:26:43.657 --> 01:26:45.773
- When?
- When you leave.

1077
01:26:49.454 --> 01:26:50.615
I'll just leave them.

1078
01:26:50.831 --> 01:26:52.663
- Just leave?
- They got other girls.

1079
01:26:52.874 --> 01:26:55.787
You just can't do that.
What are you gonna do?

1080
01:26:58.755 --> 01:27:00.120
Want me to call the cops?

1081
01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:02.832
The cops don't do nothing.
You know that.

1082
01:27:03.468 --> 01:27:07.177
Look, Sport never treated me bad.
He didn't beat me up once.

1083
01:27:07.472 --> 01:27:10.806
But you can't allow him to do
the same to other girls.

1084
01:27:10.976 --> 01:27:12.558
You can't allow him to do that.

1085
01:27:12.811 --> 01:27:14.973
He is the lowest kind
of person in the world.

1086
01:27:15.272 --> 01:27:17.138
Somebody's got to do something to him.

1087
01:27:17.357 --> 01:27:18.813
He's the scum of the earth.

1088
01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:20.557
He's the worst...

1089
01:27:21.862 --> 01:27:24.354
sucking scum I have ever, ever seen.

1090
01:27:27.159 --> 01:27:29.526
You know what he told me about you?

1091
01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:35.573
He called you names.
He called you a little piece of chicken.

1092
01:27:37.085 --> 01:27:40.168
He does... He... He doesn't mean it.

1093
01:27:42.174 --> 01:27:45.838
I'll move up to one of them
communes in Vermont.

1094
01:27:50.182 --> 01:27:53.174
I never seen a commune before,
but I don't know.

1095
01:27:53.393 --> 01:27:58.934
I saw some pictures once in a magazine.
It didn't look very clean.

1096
01:27:59.524 --> 01:28:01.435
Why don't you come
to the commune with me?

1097
01:28:01.693 --> 01:28:05.231
What? Come to the commune
with you? No, no.

1098
01:28:05.447 --> 01:28:06.858
Why not?

1099
01:28:08.742 --> 01:28:12.610
- I don't go to places like that.
- Oh, come on, why not?

1100
01:28:12.871 --> 01:28:14.862
I don't get along with people like that.

1101
01:28:15.373 --> 01:28:17.239
- Are you a Scorpion?
- What?

1102
01:28:17.417 --> 01:28:20.876
That's it. You're a Scorpion.
I can tell every time.

1103
01:28:21.922 --> 01:28:24.038
<i>Besides, I gotta stay here.</i>

1104
01:28:24.257 --> 01:28:27.045
- Come on. Why?
- I got something very important to do.

1105
01:28:27.219 --> 01:28:28.835
So, what's so important?

1106
01:28:30.639 --> 01:28:32.926
I'm doing something for the government.

1107
01:28:33.767 --> 01:28:36.054
The cab thing is just part-time.

1108
01:28:37.229 --> 01:28:38.719
Are you a narc?

1109
01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:42.355
Do I look like a narc?

1110
01:28:43.235 --> 01:28:44.896
Yeah.

1111
01:28:45.570 --> 01:28:46.651
I am a narc.

1112
01:28:48.448 --> 01:28:51.907
God! I don't know who's weirder,
you or me.

1113
01:28:58.250 --> 01:29:02.244
- Sure you don't wanna come with me?
- I'll give you the money to go.

1114
01:29:02.796 --> 01:29:05.458
- You don't have to do that.
- No, no. I want you to take it.

1115
01:29:05.757 --> 01:29:08.465
I don't want you to take anything
from them.

1116
01:29:08.802 --> 01:29:10.509
And I wanna do it.

1117
01:29:10.887 --> 01:29:13.254
I don't have anything better
to do with my money.

1118
01:29:15.141 --> 01:29:17.428
I might be going away for a while.

1119
01:29:43.044 --> 01:29:46.457
You're just a little tense, that's all.

1120
01:29:46.715 --> 01:29:49.173
I don't like what I'm doing, Sport.

1121
01:29:49.467 --> 01:29:52.425
Baby, I never wanted you
to like what you're doing.

1122
01:29:52.637 --> 01:29:56.551
If you ever liked what you were doing,
you wouldn't be my woman.

1123
01:29:58.310 --> 01:30:00.802
You never spend any time
with me anymore.

1124
01:30:00.979 --> 01:30:04.062
Well, I got to attend to business, baby.

1125
01:30:05.150 --> 01:30:07.642
You miss your man, don't you?

1126
01:30:08.987 --> 01:30:12.355
I don't like to be away from you either.

1127
01:30:12.574 --> 01:30:15.157
You know how I feel about you.

1128
01:30:16.244 --> 01:30:18.235
I depend on you.

1129
01:30:20.665 --> 01:30:21.826
I'd be lost without you.

1130
01:30:23.335 --> 01:30:25.702
Don't you ever forget that.

1131
01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:37.467
How much I need you.

1132
01:30:39.559 --> 01:30:41.391
Come to me, baby.

1133
01:30:51.529 --> 01:30:53.270
Let me hold you.

1134
01:30:59.871 --> 01:31:04.115
When you're close to me
like this, I feel so good.

1135
01:31:08.797 --> 01:31:13.291
I only wish every man could know
what it's like to be loved by you.

1136
01:31:18.264 --> 01:31:21.222
That every woman, everywhere...

1137
01:31:22.936 --> 01:31:26.054
had a man who loves her
like I love you.

1138
01:31:29.901 --> 01:31:33.314
God, it's good so close.

1139
01:31:45.291 --> 01:31:47.282
You know, at times like this...

1140
01:31:47.794 --> 01:31:50.627
know I'm a lucky man.

1141
01:31:53.425 --> 01:31:56.668
Touching a woman
who wants me and needs me.

1142
01:32:03.143 --> 01:32:06.101
It's only you that keeps me together.

1143
01:33:38.196 --> 01:33:41.029
<i>Now I see it clearly.
My whole life has pointed...</i>

1144
01:33:41.241 --> 01:33:43.528
<i>in one direction. I see that now.</i>

1145
01:33:45.203 --> 01:33:48.241
<i>There never has been any choice for me.</i>

1146
01:34:23.366 --> 01:34:24.401
Ladies and gentlemen...

1147
01:34:24.617 --> 01:34:28.906
the next president of the United
States, Senator Charles Palantine.

1148
01:34:35.336 --> 01:34:36.622
Thank you, Tom.

1149
01:34:37.922 --> 01:34:39.083
Ladies and gentlemen...

1150
01:34:40.091 --> 01:34:44.426
we are met today at a crossroads,
Columbus Circle.

1151
01:34:44.596 --> 01:34:46.758
This is no ordinary place.

1152
01:34:46.973 --> 01:34:51.763
It is a place where many roads
and many lives intersect.

1153
01:34:52.937 --> 01:34:55.599
It is appropriate that
we meet here today...

1154
01:34:55.899 --> 01:34:59.142
because these are not ordinary times.

1155
01:34:59.444 --> 01:35:02.436
We meet at a crossroads in history.

1156
01:35:04.115 --> 01:35:07.779
For far too long, the wrong roads
have been taken.

1157
01:35:08.077 --> 01:35:12.287
The wrong roads have led us
into war, into poverty...

1158
01:35:12.582 --> 01:35:15.415
into unemployment and inflation.

1159
01:35:16.294 --> 01:35:19.958
Today I say to you,
we have reached the turning point.

1160
01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:27.970
No longer will we, the people,
suffer for the few.

1161
01:35:36.147 --> 01:35:40.436
Now, I would lie to you if I told you
the new roads would be easy.

1162
01:35:41.110 --> 01:35:43.147
They will not be easy.

1163
01:35:43.446 --> 01:35:46.939
Nothing that is right and good
has ever been easy.

1164
01:35:47.158 --> 01:35:49.149
We, the people, know that.

1165
01:35:53.206 --> 01:35:57.416
And we, the people,
know the right roads and the good.

1166
01:35:58.419 --> 01:36:02.708
Today I say to you,
we are the people, you and ll.

1167
01:36:02.966 --> 01:36:06.209
And it is time to let the people rule!

1168
01:36:06.469 --> 01:36:07.675
Thank you.

1169
01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:26.187
All right, let him through. Pull back.

1170
01:36:30.952 --> 01:36:33.068
Palantine.

1171
01:36:40.837 --> 01:36:42.544
Thank you. Thank you.

1172
01:36:47.468 --> 01:36:48.833
Over there. Get that man.

1173
01:36:51.180 --> 01:36:52.762
Give him some air!

1174
01:36:53.474 --> 01:36:55.385
Give him some air, will you?

1175
01:36:55.685 --> 01:36:57.676
- I never saw him.
- I saw him run.

1176
01:36:57.854 --> 01:36:59.720
- I saw him.
- Where was he?

1177
01:37:26.382 --> 01:37:27.543
What's happening?

1178
01:37:27.759 --> 01:37:29.090
Got the money?

1179
01:37:40.271 --> 01:37:41.432
- Iris in her room?
- Yeah.

1180
01:37:41.606 --> 01:37:43.096
Okay.

1181
01:38:18.851 --> 01:38:20.808
Hey, Sport, how you doing?

1182
01:38:20.978 --> 01:38:23.094
Okay, okay, my man. How...?

1183
01:38:24.607 --> 01:38:27.474
- Where do I know you from, man?
- I don't know.

1184
01:38:27.693 --> 01:38:30.856
How's everything in the
pimp business? Huh?

1185
01:38:31.155 --> 01:38:33.317
- Do I know you?
- No.

1186
01:38:33.574 --> 01:38:34.985
Do I know you?

1187
01:38:35.284 --> 01:38:37.116
Get out of here. Come on, get lost.

1188
01:38:37.328 --> 01:38:38.944
Do I know you?

1189
01:38:41.290 --> 01:38:42.655
How's Iris?

1190
01:38:42.959 --> 01:38:44.324
You know Iris.

1191
01:38:44.585 --> 01:38:47.293
No, I don't know nobody named Iris.

1192
01:38:47.505 --> 01:38:49.587
Iris? Come on, get out of here, man.

1193
01:38:50.091 --> 01:38:54.801
- You don't know anybody named Iris?
- I don't know nobody named Iris.

1194
01:38:55.304 --> 01:38:56.510
No?

1195
01:38:56.848 --> 01:38:59.385
Get back to your fucking tribe
before you get hurt.

1196
01:38:59.684 --> 01:39:02.096
I don't want no trouble, huh, okay?

1197
01:39:03.604 --> 01:39:05.015
You got a gun?

1198
01:39:06.232 --> 01:39:09.350
Get the fuck out of here, man.
Get out of here.

1199
01:39:09.861 --> 01:39:11.022
Suck on this.

1200
01:39:46.564 --> 01:39:47.564
Hey!

1201
01:40:25.728 --> 01:40:27.765
You crazy son of a bitch!

1202
01:40:28.064 --> 01:40:29.429
Fucking son of a bitch!

1203
01:40:29.732 --> 01:40:31.564
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

1204
01:40:31.776 --> 01:40:34.313
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

1205
01:40:34.487 --> 01:40:37.479
I'll kill you! I'll fucking kill you!

1206
01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:39.822
Crazy son of a bitch! I'll kill you!

1207
01:40:57.468 --> 01:40:58.799
Crazy son of a bitch!

1208
01:40:58.970 --> 01:41:02.429
You fucking bastard! I'll kill you!

1209
01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:05.758
You crazy son of a bitch! I'll kill you!

1210
01:41:05.935 --> 01:41:09.974
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

1211
01:41:12.942 --> 01:41:14.478
Stop!

1212
01:41:26.956 --> 01:41:28.538
No! Don't shoot him!

1213
01:46:08.112 --> 01:46:09.602
<i>Dear Mr. Bickle:</i>

1214
01:46:09.822 --> 01:46:13.781
<i>I can't say how happy
Mrs. Steensma and I were...</i>

1215
01:46:13.951 --> 01:46:16.943
<i>to hear that you are well
and recuperating.</i>

1216
01:46:17.162 --> 01:46:20.029
<i>We tried to visit you at the hospital...</i>

1217
01:46:20.291 --> 01:46:22.953
<i>when we were in New York
to pick up Iris...</i>

1218
01:46:23.252 --> 01:46:25.789
<i>but you were still in a coma.</i>

1219
01:46:26.088 --> 01:46:28.125
<i>There is no way we can repay you...</i>

1220
01:46:28.340 --> 01:46:31.458
<i>for returning our Iris to us.</i>

1221
01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:33.421
<i>We thought we had lost her...</i>

1222
01:46:33.637 --> 01:46:36.800
<i>and now our lives are full again.</i>

1223
01:46:37.308 --> 01:46:38.639
<i>Needless to say...</i>

1224
01:46:38.851 --> 01:46:43.345
<i>you are something of a hero
around this household.</i>

1225
01:46:44.106 --> 01:46:47.599
<i>I'm sure you want to know about Iris.</i>

1226
01:46:47.818 --> 01:46:51.311
<i>She's back in school and working hard.</i>

1227
01:46:51.614 --> 01:46:54.652
<i>The transition has been
very hard for her...</i>

1228
01:46:54.825 --> 01:46:56.156
<i>as you can well imagine.</i>

1229
01:46:57.661 --> 01:46:59.197
<i>But we have taken steps to see...</i>

1230
01:46:59.455 --> 01:47:03.619
<i>She has never cause to run away again.</i>

1231
01:47:04.209 --> 01:47:05.620
<i>In conclusion...</i>

1232
01:47:05.836 --> 01:47:09.579
<i>Mrs. Steensma and I
would like to again thank you...</i>

1233
01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:12.502
<i>from the bottom of our hearts.</i>

1234
01:47:12.718 --> 01:47:16.803
<i>Unfortunately, we cannot afford
to come to New York again...</i>

1235
01:47:17.014 --> 01:47:20.973
<i>to thank you in person,
or we surely would.</i>

1236
01:47:21.185 --> 01:47:24.018
<i>But if you should ever
come to Pittsburgh...</i>

1237
01:47:24.313 --> 01:47:28.853
<i>you would find yourself
a most welcome guest in our home.</i>

1238
01:47:29.151 --> 01:47:34.021
<i>Our deepest thanks,
Burt and Ivy Steensma.</i>

1239
01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:39.529
Eddie, the owner-operator,
he says, "Hey, I wanna swap tires."

1240
01:47:39.703 --> 01:47:41.319
I say, "These are new tires.

1241
01:47:41.872 --> 01:47:44.705
Why don't you throw in
something else, like your wife?"

1242
01:47:44.917 --> 01:47:46.828
His wife was Miss New Jersey of 1957.

1243
01:47:47.002 --> 01:47:48.993
That's why the fleet has no spares.

1244
01:47:49.213 --> 01:47:51.625
- Doughboy, Wizard, Killer.
- Hey.

1245
01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:54.252
- Charlie T.
- What's happening?

1246
01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:56.751
Hey, Travis, you got a fare.

1247
01:47:58.263 --> 01:47:59.549
Shit.

1248
01:48:00.391 --> 01:48:01.756
Well, see you later.

1249
01:48:02.059 --> 01:48:03.675
See you, Travis.

1250
01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:26.576
Hello, Travis.

1251
01:48:28.043 --> 01:48:29.249
Hello.

1252
01:48:50.190 --> 01:48:52.898
I hear Palantine got the nomination.

1253
01:48:54.194 --> 01:48:57.277
Yeah, won't be long now.
Seventeen days.

1254
01:48:58.323 --> 01:49:00.189
Well, I hope he wins.

1255
01:49:13.797 --> 01:49:16.915
I read about you in the papers.
How are you?

1256
01:49:19.762 --> 01:49:22.470
Oh, it was nothing, really.
I got over that.

1257
01:49:24.975 --> 01:49:27.307
The papers always blow these things up.

1258
01:49:27.478 --> 01:49:29.139
Mm-hm.

1259
01:49:29.313 --> 01:49:32.601
Just a little stiffness. That's all.

1260
01:50:08.852 --> 01:50:10.843
Travis.

1261
01:50:16.568 --> 01:50:18.275
How much was it?

1262
01:50:27.412 --> 01:50:28.777
So long.
