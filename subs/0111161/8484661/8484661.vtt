00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:07.502
<i>Mr. Dufresne, describe...</i>

2
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:12.049
...the confrontation you had with
your wife the night she was murdered.

3
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.388
It was very bitter.

4
00:02:18.722 --> 00:02:23.060
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around.

5
00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:28.065
And she said that she wanted
a divorce in Reno.

6
00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:31.985
-What was your response?
-I told her I would not grant one.

7
00:02:32.194 --> 00:02:35.364
"I'll see you in hell
before I see you in Reno."

8
00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:38.909
Those were your words,
according to your neighbors.

9
00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:41.578
If they say so.

10
00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.623
I really don't remember. I was upset.

11
00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:47.334
What happened after you argued
with your wife?

12
00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:50.253
She packed a bag.

13
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:54.591
She packed a bag to go
and stay with Mr. Quentin.

14
00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:59.346
<i>Glenn Quentin, golf pro
at the Snowden Hills Country Club...</i>

15
00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:02.683
<i>...whom you had discovered
was your wife's lover.</i>

16
00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:06.186
Did you follow her?

17
00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:09.606
I went to a few bars first.

18
00:03:09.815 --> 00:03:14.194
Later, I drove to his house
to confront them. They weren't home.

19
00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:16.279
I parked in the turnout...

20
00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:17.989
<i>...and waited.</i>

21
00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:19.866
<i>With what intention ?</i>

22
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.910
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

23
00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.496
<i>I was confused...</i>

24
00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:25.956
<i>...drunk.</i>

25
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.583
<i>I think...</i>

26
00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:30.961
<i>...mostly I wanted to scare them.</i>

27
00:03:31.128 --> 00:03:34.506
When they arrived , you went up
to the house and murdered them.

28
00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:36.800
No, I was sobering up.

29
00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:40.679
I got back in the car
and I drove home to sleep it off.

30
00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:43.849
Along the way, I threw my gun
into the Royal River.

31
00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.143
I've been very clear on this point.

32
00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:50.355
I get hazy where the cleaning woman
shows up the following morning ...

33
00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:53.150
...and finds your wife in bed
with her lover...

34
00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:55.485
... riddled with .38-caliber bullets.

35
00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.032
Does that strike you as a
fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?

36
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:02.951
Yes, it does.

37
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.329
Yet you still maintain
you threw your gun into the river...

38
00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:08.582
... before the murders took place.

39
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.001
That's very convenient.

40
00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.878
It's the truth.

41
00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:17.841
The police dragged that river for
three days, and nary a gun was found ...

42
00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:22.137
...so no comparison could be made
between your gun and the bullets...

43
00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:25.766
...taken from the bloodstained corpses
of the victims.

44
00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:28.852
And that also...

45
00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:32.731
... is very convenient.
Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

46
00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:36.151
Since I am innocent of this crime...

47
00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:41.031
... I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

48
00:04:58.882 --> 00:05:02.219
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
you've heard all the evidence.</i>

49
00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:06.264
<i>We have the accused at the scene
of the crime. We have footprints.</i>

50
00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:09.351
<i>Bullets on the ground
bearing his fingerprints.</i>

51
00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:12.521
<i>A broken bourbon bottle,
likewise with fingerprints.</i>

52
00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.272
<i>And most of all...</i>

53
00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:17.567
<i>...we have a beautiful young woman
and her lover...</i>

54
00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:19.778
<i>...lying dead in each other's arms.</i>

55
00:05:20.946 --> 00:05:23.573
<i>They had sinned.</i>

56
00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:27.327
<i>But was their crime so great...</i>

57
00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:29.788
<i>...as to merit a death sentence ?</i>

58
00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:32.290
While you think about that...

59
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.544
...think about this:

60
00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.131
A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.

61
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.052
I submit that this was not
a hot-blooded crime of passion.

62
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:47.055
That at least could be understood ,
if not condoned.

63
00:05:47.264 --> 00:05:48.265
No.

64
00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:50.433
This was revenge...

65
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.271
...of a much more brutal ,
cold-blooded nature. Consider this:

66
00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:56.857
<i>Four bullets per victim.</i>

67
00:05:57.607 --> 00:05:59.317
<i>Not six shots fired, but eight.</i>

68
00:05:59.818 --> 00:06:03.446
<i>That means that he fired
the gun empty...</i>

69
00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:06.449
<i>...and then stopped to reload...</i>

70
00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:09.286
<i>...so that he could shoot
each of them again.</i>

71
00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:12.080
<i>An extra bullet per lover...</i>

72
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:14.624
<i>...right in the head.</i>

73
00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:22.924
You strike me as a particularly icy
and remorseless man , Mr. Dufresne.

74
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.468
It chills my blood just to look at you.

75
00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:30.140
By the power vested in me
by the state of Maine...

76
00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:34.644
... I hereby order you to serve
two life sentences back-to-back...

77
00:06:34.978 --> 00:06:37.522
...one for each of your victims. So be it!

78
00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:03.840
Sit.

79
00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:11.181
We see you've served
20 years of a life sentence?

80
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.352
-Yes, sir.
-You feel you've been rehabilitated?

81
00:07:15.727 --> 00:07:18.355
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

82
00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:21.483
I mean , I learned my lesson.

83
00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:25.987
I can honestly say
that I'm a changed man.

84
00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:31.576
I'm no longer a danger to society.

85
00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:33.745
That's God's honest truth.

86
00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:11.366
Hey, Red.

87
00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:12.867
How'd it go?

88
00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:15.245
Same old shit, different day.

89
00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:17.372
Yeah , I know how you feel.

90
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.582
I'm up for rejection next week.

91
00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:22.877
Yeah , I got rejected last week.

92
00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:24.379
It happens.

93
00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:26.006
Hey, Red , bump me a deck.

94
00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:29.509
Get out of my face, man !
You're into me for five packs already.

95
00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:30.719
-Four!
-Five!

96
00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:35.265
<i>There must be a con like me
in every prison in America.</i>

97
00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:37.267
<i>I'm the guy who can get it for you.</i>

98
00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:40.603
<i>Cigarettes, a bag of reefer,
if that's your thing...</i>

99
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:44.232
<i>...a bottle of brandy to celebrate
your kid's high school graduation.</i>

100
00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:46.568
<i>Damn near anything within reason.</i>

101
00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:50.488
<i>Yes, sir. I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.</i>

102
00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.369
<i>So when Andy Dufresne
came to me in 1949...</i>

103
00:08:56.578 --> 00:09:00.123
<i>...and asked me to smuggle
Rita Hayworth into the prison for him...</i>

104
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:02.625
<i>...I told him, "No problem."</i>

105
00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:26.316
<i>Officers to main gate.
Officers to main gate.</i>

106
00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:29.527
<i>Secure main gate.</i>

107
00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:46.669
<i>Andy came to Shawshank Prison...</i>

108
00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:50.757
<i>...in early 1947 for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging.</i>

109
00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:55.178
<i>On the outside, he'd been vice president
of a large Portland bank.</i>

110
00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:57.388
<i>Good work for a man so young.</i>

111
00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:04.270
Hey, Red.

112
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.392
You speak English , butt-steak?

113
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.477
You follow this officer.

114
00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.494
I never seen such a sorry-looking
heap of maggot shit in all my life.

115
00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:04.330
Hey, fish ! Come over here!

116
00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:28.980
Taking bets today, Red?

117
00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:31.065
Smokes or coin? Bettor's choice.

118
00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:32.942
Smokes. Put me down for two.

119
00:11:33.484 --> 00:11:35.069
All right, who's your horse?

120
00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:37.030
That little sack of shit.

121
00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:41.910
-Eighth. He'll be first.
-Bullshit! I'll take that action.

122
00:11:42.076 --> 00:11:44.329
You're out some smokes, son.

123
00:11:44.495 --> 00:11:46.289
If you're so smart, you call it.

124
00:11:46.497 --> 00:11:49.584
I'll take the chubby fat-ass there.

125
00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:52.378
The fifth one.
Put me down for a quarter deck.

126
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.300
Fresh fish today!

127
00:11:58.051 --> 00:11:59.510
We're reeling them in!

128
00:12:00.178 --> 00:12:03.848
<i>I admit I didn't think much of Andy
first time I laid eyes on him.</i>

129
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.310
<i>Looked like a stiff breeze
would blow him over.</i>

130
00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:09.771
<i>That was my first impression of the man.</i>

131
00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:11.397
What do you say?

132
00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:14.901
That tall drink of water
with the silver spoon up his ass.

133
00:12:15.109 --> 00:12:17.237
That guy? Never happen.

134
00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:19.697
-Ten cigarettes.
-That's a rich bet.

135
00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:21.991
Who's going to prove me wrong?

136
00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:23.993
Heywood? Jigger?

137
00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:25.578
Skeets?

138
00:12:25.787 --> 00:12:27.121
Floyd!

139
00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:30.124
Four brave souls.

140
00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:33.086
<i>Return to your cell blocks
for evening count.</i>

141
00:12:33.294 --> 00:12:36.589
<i>All prisoners, return to your cell blocks.</i>

142
00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:58.152
Turn to the right!

143
00:12:58.319 --> 00:12:59.612
Eyes front.

144
00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:15.295
This is Mr. Hadley.
He's captain of the guards.

145
00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:17.588
I'm Mr. Norton , the warden.

146
00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:20.008
You are convicted felons.

147
00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.302
That's why they've sent you to me.

148
00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:24.262
Rule number one:

149
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.972
No blasphemy.

150
00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:29.892
I'll not have the Lord's name
taken in vain in my prison.

151
00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:31.311
The other rules...

152
00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:34.814
...you'll figure out as you go along .
Any questions?

153
00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:36.232
When do we eat?

154
00:13:44.907 --> 00:13:46.951
You eat when we say you eat.

155
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.413
You shit when we say you shit,
and piss when we say you piss.

156
00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:53.458
You got that,
you maggot-dick motherfucker?

157
00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:56.711
On your feet.

158
00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:58.671
I believe in two things:

159
00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.341
Discipline and the Bible.

160
00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:03.926
Here, you'll receive both.

161
00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:06.846
Put your trust in the Lord.

162
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:09.682
Your ass belongs to me.

163
00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:13.436
Welcome to Shawshank.

164
00:14:18.608 --> 00:14:19.942
Unhook them.

165
00:14:25.365 --> 00:14:26.783
Turn around.

166
00:14:33.623 --> 00:14:35.041
That's enough.

167
00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.960
Move to the end of the cage.

168
00:14:38.961 --> 00:14:41.464
Turn around. Delouse him.

169
00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:44.884
Turn around.

170
00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.431
Move out of the cage.
Pick up your clothes and Bible.

171
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.974
Next man up!

172
00:14:54.268 --> 00:14:56.979
To the right. Right. Right.

173
00:14:57.522 --> 00:14:58.773
Left.

174
00:14:59.148 --> 00:15:02.985
<i>The first night's the toughest.
No doubt about it.</i>

175
00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:06.531
<i>They march you in
naked as the day you were born...</i>

176
00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:10.535
<i>...skin burning and half-blind
from that delousing shit.</i>

177
00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:13.621
<i>And when they put you in that cell...</i>

178
00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.165
<i>...and those bars slam home...</i>

179
00:15:16.624 --> 00:15:18.835
<i>...that's when you know it's for real.</i>

180
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.422
<i>Old life blown away
in the blink of an eye.</i>

181
00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:27.009
<i>Nothing left but all the time
in the world to think about it.</i>

182
00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:31.514
<i>Most new fish come close to madness
the first night.</i>

183
00:15:31.848 --> 00:15:34.767
<i>Somebody always breaks down crying.</i>

184
00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:36.936
<i>Happens every time.</i>

185
00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:39.647
<i>The only question is...</i>

186
00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:41.607
<i>...who's it going to be ?</i>

187
00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:45.945
<i>It's as good a thing
to bet on as any, I guess.</i>

188
00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:49.699
<i>I had my money on Andy Dufresne.</i>

189
00:15:58.708 --> 00:16:00.376
Lights out!

190
00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:23.232
<i>I remember my first night.</i>

191
00:16:24.066 --> 00:16:26.986
<i>Seems like a long time ago.</i>

192
00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:31.824
Hey, fish.

193
00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:34.660
Fish , fish.

194
00:16:36.245 --> 00:16:37.997
What are you , scared of the dark?

195
00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:43.044
Bet you wish your daddy
never dicked your mama!

196
00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:46.672
Piggy! Pork! I want me a pork chop.

197
00:16:51.511 --> 00:16:54.847
-Poke your ass out, give me a first look!
-Keep it down.

198
00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:58.267
<i>The boys always go fishing
with first-timers.</i>

199
00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:01.521
<i>And they don't quit
till they reel someone in.</i>

200
00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:04.524
Hey, Fat Ass.

201
00:17:06.025 --> 00:17:07.360
Fat Ass!

202
00:17:08.528 --> 00:17:10.279
Talk to me, boy.

203
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.658
I know you're there.
I can hear you breathing.

204
00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:16.827
Don't you listen to these nitwits,
you hear me?

205
00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:18.955
This place ain't so bad.

206
00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:20.623
Tell you what...

207
00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:24.961
... I'll introduce you around,
make you feel right at home.

208
00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:28.548
I know a couple of
big old bull queers that'd just...

209
00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:30.716
... love to make your acquaintance.

210
00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:34.428
Especially that big , white,
mushy butt of yours.

211
00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:35.721
God!

212
00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:37.807
I don't belong here!

213
00:17:37.974 --> 00:17:40.810
-We have a winner!
-I want to go home!

214
00:17:41.102 --> 00:17:43.771
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

215
00:17:46.566 --> 00:17:50.278
<i>Fresh fish! Fresh fish! Fresh fish! </i>

216
00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.655
I don't belong here.

217
00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:56.242
I want to go home!

218
00:17:57.201 --> 00:17:58.452
I want my mother!

219
00:17:58.703 --> 00:18:00.830
I had your mother!
She wasn't that great!

220
00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:07.253
What the Christ is this horseshit?

221
00:18:07.461 --> 00:18:09.547
He blasphemed. I'll tell the warden.

222
00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:13.175
-You'll tell him with my baton up your ass!
-You gotta let me out!

223
00:18:13.384 --> 00:18:16.804
What is your malfunction ,
you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

224
00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:20.016
Please! I ain't supposed to be here.

225
00:18:20.516 --> 00:18:21.559
Not me!

226
00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:24.103
I won't count to three. Not even to one.

227
00:18:24.312 --> 00:18:26.355
You shut up, or I'll sing you a lullaby!

228
00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:29.567
-Shut up, man. Shut up!
-There's been a mistake.

229
00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:32.987
You don't understand.
I'm not supposed to be here.

230
00:18:33.195 --> 00:18:34.488
Open that cell.

231
00:18:34.697 --> 00:18:37.950
Me neither! They run this place
like a fucking prison!

232
00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:47.460
Son of a bitch!

233
00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:54.717
Captain , take it easy!

234
00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:20.368
If I hear so much as a mouse fart
in here tonight...

235
00:19:20.576 --> 00:19:23.996
... I swear by God and Jesus,
you will all visit the infirmary.

236
00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:26.832
Every last motherfucker in here.

237
00:19:30.252 --> 00:19:33.923
Call the trustees. Take that
tub of shit down to the infirmary.

238
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:52.900
<i>His first night in the joint,
Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes.</i>

239
00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:56.112
<i>He never made a sound.</i>

240
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.796
Tier 3 north , clear count!

241
00:20:14.672 --> 00:20:16.757
-Tier 2 north , clear.
-Tier 2 south , clear.

242
00:20:17.007 --> 00:20:19.385
Tier 3 south , clear.

243
00:20:20.177 --> 00:20:23.639
-Tier 1 south , clear.
-Tier 4 south , clear.

244
00:20:24.223 --> 00:20:25.808
Prepare to roll out.

245
00:20:29.395 --> 00:20:30.896
Roll out!

246
00:21:24.825 --> 00:21:26.994
Are you going to eat that?

247
00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.914
I hadn't planned on it.

248
00:21:30.998 --> 00:21:32.208
Do you mind?

249
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.218
That's nice and ripe.

250
00:21:53.938 --> 00:21:56.023
Jake says thank you.

251
00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:59.693
Fell out of his nest
over by the plate shop.

252
00:22:01.111 --> 00:22:04.490
I'm going to look after him
until he's big enough to fly.

253
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:07.409
Oh , no! Here he comes.

254
00:22:10.746 --> 00:22:12.206
Morning , fellas.

255
00:22:12.414 --> 00:22:14.375
Fine morning , isn't it?

256
00:22:14.708 --> 00:22:16.919
You know why it's a fine morning ,
don't you?

257
00:22:17.211 --> 00:22:19.421
Send them down .
I want them lined up...

258
00:22:19.713 --> 00:22:22.258
...just like a pretty little
chorus line.

259
00:22:23.384 --> 00:22:24.593
Look at that.

260
00:22:25.094 --> 00:22:28.264
-I can't stand this guy.
-Oh , Lord!

261
00:22:28.931 --> 00:22:31.433
Yes! Richmond , Virginia.

262
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.977
Smell my ass!

263
00:22:33.185 --> 00:22:35.187
After he smells mine.

264
00:22:35.604 --> 00:22:39.316
That's a shame about your horse
coming in last and all.

265
00:22:39.525 --> 00:22:42.361
But I sure do love
that winning horse of mine, though.

266
00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:45.573
I owe that boy a big kiss
when I see him.

267
00:22:45.739 --> 00:22:49.952
Why don't you give him some of your
cigarettes instead? Lucky fuck!

268
00:22:50.244 --> 00:22:51.787
Hey, Tyrell.

269
00:22:52.121 --> 00:22:54.123
You pull infirmary duty this week?

270
00:22:55.082 --> 00:22:56.667
How's my horse doing anyway?

271
00:22:57.084 --> 00:22:58.210
Dead.

272
00:22:59.044 --> 00:23:01.255
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.

273
00:23:01.463 --> 00:23:03.632
Doc had gone home for the night.

274
00:23:04.133 --> 00:23:06.427
Poor bastard lay there
till this morning.

275
00:23:06.635 --> 00:23:09.096
By then , there wasn't nothing
we could do.

276
00:23:15.394 --> 00:23:16.687
What was his name?

277
00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:21.317
What'd you say?

278
00:23:23.235 --> 00:23:25.654
I was just wondering
if anyone knew his name.

279
00:23:26.322 --> 00:23:29.074
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

280
00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:33.203
Doesn't fucking matter
what his name was. He's dead.

281
00:23:55.267 --> 00:23:57.269
Anybody come at you yet?

282
00:23:59.396 --> 00:24:01.231
Anybody get to you yet?

283
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.444
Hey, we all need friends in here.

284
00:24:05.736 --> 00:24:07.404
I could be a friend to you.

285
00:24:16.622 --> 00:24:18.040
Hard to get.

286
00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:21.627
I like that.

287
00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:31.804
<i>Andy kept pretty much
to himself at first.</i>

288
00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:34.098
<i>I guess he had a lot on his mind...</i>

289
00:24:34.556 --> 00:24:37.393
<i>...trying to adapt
to life on the inside.</i>

290
00:24:38.102 --> 00:24:41.313
<i>Wasn't until a month went by
before he opened his mouth...</i>

291
00:24:41.522 --> 00:24:43.899
<i>...to say more than two words
to somebody.</i>

292
00:24:45.067 --> 00:24:46.652
<i>As it turned out...</i>

293
00:24:47.111 --> 00:24:48.988
<i>...that somebody was me.</i>

294
00:24:57.746 --> 00:24:59.540
I'm Andy Dufresne.

295
00:25:00.749 --> 00:25:02.501
Wife-killing banker.

296
00:25:04.753 --> 00:25:06.088
Why'd you do it?

297
00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:08.590
I didn't, since you ask.

298
00:25:09.174 --> 00:25:11.010
You're going to fit right in.

299
00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.929
Everybody in here's innocent.
Didn't you know that?

300
00:25:14.555 --> 00:25:17.766
-What you in here for?
-Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

301
00:25:20.769 --> 00:25:23.355
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

302
00:25:23.564 --> 00:25:27.151
You think your shit smells
sweeter than most. Is that right?

303
00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:28.819
What do you think?

304
00:25:29.194 --> 00:25:32.281
To tell you the truth ,
I haven't made up my mind.

305
00:25:33.407 --> 00:25:36.201
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

306
00:25:37.161 --> 00:25:40.456
I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time.

307
00:25:40.664 --> 00:25:43.250
I wonder if you might get me
a rock hammer.

308
00:25:43.959 --> 00:25:45.252
A rock hammer.

309
00:25:45.627 --> 00:25:48.297
-What is it and why?
-What do you care?

310
00:25:49.631 --> 00:25:52.342
For a toothbrush , I wouldn't ask.
I'd quote a price.

311
00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:54.970
But a toothbrush
is a non-lethal object, isn't it?

312
00:25:56.555 --> 00:25:57.973
Fair enough.

313
00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:01.018
A rock hammer is about
six or seven inches long.

314
00:26:01.226 --> 00:26:03.562
-Looks like a miniature pickax.
-Pickax?

315
00:26:03.771 --> 00:26:04.980
For rocks.

316
00:26:07.566 --> 00:26:08.817
Quartz?

317
00:26:12.738 --> 00:26:16.200
And some mica, shale...

318
00:26:17.451 --> 00:26:18.702
... limestone.

319
00:26:18.952 --> 00:26:20.079
So?

320
00:26:20.996 --> 00:26:22.831
So I'm a rock hound.

321
00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:26.376
At least I was in my old life.
I'd like to be again.

322
00:26:26.668 --> 00:26:29.797
Or maybe you'd like to sink your toy
into somebody's skull.

323
00:26:31.256 --> 00:26:32.841
No, I have no enemies here.

324
00:26:33.008 --> 00:26:35.344
No? Wait a while.

325
00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:38.555
Word gets around.

326
00:26:39.223 --> 00:26:41.725
The Sisters have taken
quite a liking to you.

327
00:26:43.102 --> 00:26:44.895
Especially Bogs.

328
00:26:45.896 --> 00:26:49.358
Don't suppose it would help if I
told them I'm not homosexual.

329
00:26:49.525 --> 00:26:50.984
Neither are they.

330
00:26:51.193 --> 00:26:54.655
You have to be human first.
They don't qualify.

331
00:26:59.159 --> 00:27:03.539
Bull queers take by force.
That's all they want or understand.

332
00:27:03.747 --> 00:27:07.292
If I were you , I'd grow eyes
in the back of my head.

333
00:27:07.501 --> 00:27:10.254
-Thanks for the advice.
-Well , that's free.

334
00:27:10.587 --> 00:27:12.548
You understand my concern.

335
00:27:12.756 --> 00:27:15.384
If there's trouble,
I won't use the rock hammer.

336
00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:20.347
Then I'd guess you want to escape.
Tunnel under the wall , maybe.

337
00:27:21.223 --> 00:27:22.891
What did I miss? What's so funny?

338
00:27:23.308 --> 00:27:26.019
You'll understand
when you see the rock hammer.

339
00:27:27.855 --> 00:27:30.065
What's an item like this usually go for?

340
00:27:30.274 --> 00:27:32.776
Seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.

341
00:27:33.277 --> 00:27:35.737
My normal markup's 20 percent.

342
00:27:35.946 --> 00:27:38.323
But this is a specialty item.

343
00:27:38.532 --> 00:27:42.995
Risk goes up, price goes up.
Let's make it an even 10 bucks.

344
00:27:43.203 --> 00:27:44.538
Ten it is.

345
00:27:46.248 --> 00:27:48.292
Waste of money, if you ask me.

346
00:27:48.584 --> 00:27:49.877
Why's that?

347
00:27:51.253 --> 00:27:54.298
Folks around this joint
love surprise inspections.

348
00:27:55.924 --> 00:27:57.885
They find it, you're going to lose it.

349
00:27:58.093 --> 00:28:00.179
If they catch you , you don't know me.

350
00:28:00.387 --> 00:28:02.598
Mention my name,
we never do business again.

351
00:28:03.098 --> 00:28:06.226
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.
Now you got that?

352
00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.604
I understand.

353
00:28:09.813 --> 00:28:11.940
Thank you , Mr...

354
00:28:12.107 --> 00:28:13.150
Red.

355
00:28:13.901 --> 00:28:15.194
Name's Red.

356
00:28:16.612 --> 00:28:18.280
Why do they call you that?

357
00:28:22.034 --> 00:28:24.036
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

358
00:28:32.211 --> 00:28:35.088
<i>I could see why some of the boys
took him for snobby.</i>

359
00:28:35.964 --> 00:28:38.383
<i>He had a quiet way about him...</i>

360
00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:42.888
<i>...a walk and a talk that just
wasn't normal around here.</i>

361
00:28:43.222 --> 00:28:44.681
<i>He strolled...</i>

362
00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:49.102
<i>...like a man in the park without a care
or a worry in the world.</i>

363
00:28:49.311 --> 00:28:53.982
<i>Like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place.</i>

364
00:28:55.901 --> 00:28:58.153
<i>I think it would be fair to say...</i>

365
00:28:58.403 --> 00:29:00.656
<i>...I liked Andy from the start.</i>

366
00:29:02.407 --> 00:29:05.994
Let's go! Some of us
got a schedule to keep.

367
00:29:09.331 --> 00:29:11.833
Move it! Come on , move it!

368
00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:17.339
How you doing?
How's the wife treating you?

369
00:29:29.017 --> 00:29:30.978
Keep it moving.

370
00:29:34.273 --> 00:29:36.024
Red.

371
00:29:55.502 --> 00:29:56.962
<i>Andy was right.</i>

372
00:29:57.212 --> 00:29:59.423
<i>I finally got the joke.</i>

373
00:29:59.715 --> 00:30:02.134
<i>It would take a man about 000 years...</i>

374
00:30:02.342 --> 00:30:04.803
<i>...to tunnel under the wall
with one of these.</i>

375
00:30:08.557 --> 00:30:11.018
-Book?
-Not today.

376
00:30:17.065 --> 00:30:19.067
-Book?
-No.

377
00:30:25.407 --> 00:30:27.576
Delivery for Dufresne.

378
00:30:38.378 --> 00:30:39.880
Book?

379
00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:46.845
Dufresne, here's your book.

380
00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:53.101
Thanks.

381
00:30:59.358 --> 00:31:03.070
We're running low on hexite.
Get on back and fetch us up some.

382
00:31:40.357 --> 00:31:41.942
This will blind you.

383
00:31:42.317 --> 00:31:44.694
Honey, hush.

384
00:31:57.249 --> 00:31:59.209
That's it. You fight!

385
00:31:59.418 --> 00:32:00.877
Better that way.

386
00:32:09.136 --> 00:32:12.222
<i>I wish I could tell you
Andy fought the good fight...</i>

387
00:32:12.431 --> 00:32:14.433
<i>...and the Sisters let him be.</i>

388
00:32:15.016 --> 00:32:16.852
<i>I wish I could tell you that...</i>

389
00:32:17.018 --> 00:32:20.021
<i>...but prison is no fairy-tale world.</i>

390
00:32:21.148 --> 00:32:23.108
<i>He never said who did it.</i>

391
00:32:23.358 --> 00:32:24.943
<i>But we all knew.</i>

392
00:32:29.781 --> 00:32:32.284
<i>Things went on like that for a while.</i>

393
00:32:32.701 --> 00:32:35.203
<i>Prison life consists of routine...</i>

394
00:32:35.454 --> 00:32:37.414
<i>...and then more routine.</i>

395
00:32:39.916 --> 00:32:43.462
<i>Every so often, Andy would show up
with fresh bruises.</i>

396
00:32:44.921 --> 00:32:46.756
<i>The Sisters kept at him.</i>

397
00:32:47.007 --> 00:32:49.050
<i>Sometimes he was able
to fight them off.</i>

398
00:32:49.259 --> 00:32:50.760
<i>Sometimes not.</i>

399
00:32:51.928 --> 00:32:54.097
<i>And that's how it went for Andy.</i>

400
00:32:54.681 --> 00:32:56.433
<i>That was his routine.</i>

401
00:32:57.267 --> 00:33:00.729
<i>I do believe those first two years
were the worst for him.</i>

402
00:33:01.229 --> 00:33:04.566
<i>And I also believe
if things had gone on that way...</i>

403
00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.360
<i>...this place would have
got the best of him.</i>

404
00:33:08.111 --> 00:33:10.906
<i>But then, in the spring of 1949...</i>

405
00:33:11.114 --> 00:33:13.033
<i>...the powers that be decided:</i>

406
00:33:13.241 --> 00:33:16.578
The roof of the license-plate factory
needs resurfacing.

407
00:33:16.745 --> 00:33:19.956
I need a dozen volunteers
for a week's work.

408
00:33:20.665 --> 00:33:22.125
As you know...

409
00:33:22.876 --> 00:33:26.421
...special detail carries with it
special privileges.

410
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:29.049
<i>It was outdoor detail...</i>

411
00:33:29.424 --> 00:33:33.720
<i>...and May is one damned fine month
to be working outdoors.</i>

412
00:33:34.179 --> 00:33:35.263
Stay in line there.

413
00:33:35.472 --> 00:33:38.642
<i>More than 100 men
volunteered for the job.</i>

414
00:33:42.938 --> 00:33:45.941
Wallace E. Unger.

415
00:33:46.441 --> 00:33:48.777
Ellis Redding.

416
00:33:48.985 --> 00:33:50.570
<i>Wouldn't you know it?</i>

417
00:33:50.987 --> 00:33:54.282
<i>Me and some fellows I know
were among the names called.</i>

418
00:33:54.491 --> 00:33:56.493
Andrew Dufresne.

419
00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:59.829
<i>It only cost us
a pack of smokes per man.</i>

420
00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:02.791
<i>I made my usual 20 percent, of course.</i>

421
00:34:02.999 --> 00:34:06.461
So this big-shot lawyer
calls me long-distance from Texas.

422
00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:08.255
I say, "Yeah?"

423
00:34:08.505 --> 00:34:12.133
He says, "Sorry to inform you ,
but your brother just died ."

424
00:34:12.342 --> 00:34:16.263
-I'm sorry to hear that.
-I'm not. He was an asshole.

425
00:34:16.471 --> 00:34:18.640
Ran off years ago.
Figured him for dead.

426
00:34:18.848 --> 00:34:21.142
So this lawyer fellow says to me:

427
00:34:21.351 --> 00:34:25.480
"He died a rich man ." Oil wells and shit.
Close to a million bucks.

428
00:34:26.147 --> 00:34:28.024
A million bucks?

429
00:34:28.316 --> 00:34:32.821
-Incredible how lucky some assholes get.
-You going to see any of that?

430
00:34:33.446 --> 00:34:36.199
Thirty-five thousand .
That's what he left me.

431
00:34:36.408 --> 00:34:38.159
-Dollars?
-Yep.

432
00:34:38.326 --> 00:34:41.329
That's great!
That's like winning the sweepstakes.

433
00:34:41.663 --> 00:34:42.831
Isn't it?

434
00:34:42.998 --> 00:34:45.959
Dumb shit, what do you think
the government will do to me?

435
00:34:46.167 --> 00:34:48.503
Take a big wet bite
out of my ass is what.

436
00:34:49.296 --> 00:34:50.630
Poor Byron.

437
00:34:51.506 --> 00:34:54.676
Terrible fucking luck, huh?
Crying shame.

438
00:34:54.884 --> 00:34:57.178
Some people really got it awful.

439
00:34:57.429 --> 00:34:58.805
Andy, are you nuts?

440
00:34:59.014 --> 00:35:00.890
Keep your eyes on your mop, man!

441
00:35:01.099 --> 00:35:04.060
You'll pay some tax,
but you'll still end up--

442
00:35:04.269 --> 00:35:07.063
Yeah , maybe enough to buy
a new car, and then what?

443
00:35:07.272 --> 00:35:09.441
I got to pay tax on the car. Repair...

444
00:35:09.691 --> 00:35:13.403
... maintenance, kids pestering you
to take them for a ride all the time.

445
00:35:13.653 --> 00:35:17.324
Then if you figure your tax wrong ,
you pay out of your own pocket.

446
00:35:17.532 --> 00:35:19.659
I tell you ! Uncle Sam!

447
00:35:19.868 --> 00:35:23.872
He puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

448
00:35:26.541 --> 00:35:28.710
-Getting himself killed .
-Keep tarring.

449
00:35:28.918 --> 00:35:31.463
Some brother. Shit!

450
00:35:36.384 --> 00:35:37.802
Mr. Hadley...

451
00:35:38.678 --> 00:35:40.055
...do you trust your wife?

452
00:35:41.681 --> 00:35:43.141
Oh , that's funny.

453
00:35:43.683 --> 00:35:46.353
You'll look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

454
00:35:46.519 --> 00:35:49.856
What I mean is, do you think
she'd go behind your back?

455
00:35:50.982 --> 00:35:54.402
Step aside, Mert. This fucker's
having himself an accident.

456
00:35:54.569 --> 00:35:55.695
He'll push him off!

457
00:35:55.862 --> 00:35:57.739
If you trust her, you can keep...

458
00:35:57.906 --> 00:35:59.324
...that 35,000.

459
00:36:00.075 --> 00:36:03.244
-What did you say?
-Thirty-five thousand.

460
00:36:03.411 --> 00:36:04.412
All of it.

461
00:36:04.621 --> 00:36:07.707
-Every penny.
-You better start making sense.

462
00:36:07.916 --> 00:36:10.251
If you want to keep it,
give it to your wife.

463
00:36:10.418 --> 00:36:14.339
The I RS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $60,000.

464
00:36:14.547 --> 00:36:16.925
-Bullshit. Tax-free?
-Tax-free.

465
00:36:17.092 --> 00:36:19.094
I RS can't touch one cent.

466
00:36:19.469 --> 00:36:21.930
You're that smart banker
what killed his wife.

467
00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:25.558
Why should I believe you?
So I can end up in here with you?

468
00:36:25.767 --> 00:36:28.603
It's legal. Ask the I RS.
They'll say the same thing.

469
00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:32.857
I feel stupid telling you this.
I'm sure you would have investigated.

470
00:36:33.066 --> 00:36:36.736
I don't need you to tell me
where the bear shit in the buckwheat.

471
00:36:36.945 --> 00:36:40.323
Of course not. But you do need
someone to set it up for you.

472
00:36:40.532 --> 00:36:42.117
That'll cost you. A lawyer.

473
00:36:42.283 --> 00:36:44.577
A bunch of ball-washing bastards!

474
00:36:45.036 --> 00:36:48.498
I suppose I could set it up for you .
That would save you some money.

475
00:36:48.707 --> 00:36:50.792
You get the forms, I'll prepare them ...

476
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.752
... nearly free of charge.

477
00:36:53.962 --> 00:36:57.298
I'd only ask three beers apiece
for each of my coworkers.

478
00:36:58.258 --> 00:36:59.801
"Coworkers." That's rich!

479
00:37:00.635 --> 00:37:03.138
A man working outdoors
feels more like a man ...

480
00:37:03.346 --> 00:37:06.808
... if he can have a bottle of suds.
That's only my opinion ...

481
00:37:07.267 --> 00:37:08.268
...sir.

482
00:37:12.188 --> 00:37:14.149
What are you jimmies staring at?

483
00:37:14.315 --> 00:37:15.942
Let's go! Work!

484
00:37:25.452 --> 00:37:27.370
<i>And that's how it came to pass...</i>

485
00:37:27.579 --> 00:37:30.248
<i>...that on the second-to-last
day of the job...</i>

486
00:37:30.457 --> 00:37:35.003
<i>...the convict crew that tarred
the factory roof in the spring of '49...</i>

487
00:37:35.211 --> 00:37:38.339
<i>...wound up sitting in a row
at 10:00 in the morning...</i>

488
00:37:38.548 --> 00:37:44.012
<i>...drinking icy-cold beer,
courtesy of the hardest screw...</i>

489
00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:47.515
<i>...that ever walked a turn
at Shawshank State Prison.</i>

490
00:37:47.682 --> 00:37:50.143
Drink up while it's cold , ladies.

491
00:37:51.227 --> 00:37:55.815
<i>The colossal prick even managed
to sound magnanimous.</i>

492
00:37:56.941 --> 00:38:01.404
<i>We sat and drank with the sun
on our shoulders and felt like free men.</i>

493
00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:05.200
<i>We could have been tarring
the roof of one of our own houses.</i>

494
00:38:05.408 --> 00:38:08.244
<i>We were the lords of all creation.</i>

495
00:38:08.828 --> 00:38:10.413
<i>As for Andy...</i>

496
00:38:10.663 --> 00:38:13.291
<i>...he spent that break
hunkered in the shade...</i>

497
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:16.002
<i>...a strange little smile on his face...</i>

498
00:38:16.211 --> 00:38:18.421
<i>...watching us drink his beer.</i>

499
00:38:26.554 --> 00:38:27.889
Want a cold one?

500
00:38:28.556 --> 00:38:31.518
No, thanks. I gave up drinking.

501
00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.566
<i>You could argue he'd done it
to curry favor with the guards.</i>

502
00:38:39.234 --> 00:38:43.071
<i>Or maybe make a few friends
among us cons.</i>

503
00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:44.864
<i>Me ?</i>

504
00:38:45.073 --> 00:38:47.867
<i>I think he did it
just to feel normal again...</i>

505
00:38:48.284 --> 00:38:50.537
<i>...if only for a short while.</i>

506
00:38:53.164 --> 00:38:54.249
King me.

507
00:38:56.125 --> 00:38:58.753
-Chess. Now there's a game of kings.
-What?

508
00:38:58.962 --> 00:39:00.713
Civilized. Strategic.

509
00:39:01.381 --> 00:39:04.384
And a total fucking mystery. I hate it.

510
00:39:04.634 --> 00:39:06.427
Let me teach you someday.

511
00:39:07.929 --> 00:39:08.930
Sure.

512
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:11.140
We could get a board together.

513
00:39:11.391 --> 00:39:14.435
You're talking to the right man .
I can get things, right?

514
00:39:14.644 --> 00:39:18.648
We might do business on a board ,
and I'll carve the pieces myself.

515
00:39:18.857 --> 00:39:22.151
One side in alabaster, one in soapstone.
What do you think?

516
00:39:22.777 --> 00:39:24.153
I think it'll take years.

517
00:39:24.362 --> 00:39:26.906
Years I got.
What I don't have are the rocks.

518
00:39:27.115 --> 00:39:29.075
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

519
00:39:29.284 --> 00:39:31.119
Pebbles, mostly.

520
00:39:35.456 --> 00:39:38.251
We're getting to be
kind of friends, aren't we?

521
00:39:39.127 --> 00:39:40.670
Yeah , I guess.

522
00:39:41.296 --> 00:39:42.839
Can I ask you something?

523
00:39:44.299 --> 00:39:45.758
Why'd you do it?

524
00:39:46.968 --> 00:39:48.553
I'm innocent, Red.

525
00:39:48.761 --> 00:39:50.805
Just like everybody else here.

526
00:39:55.143 --> 00:39:56.686
What are you in for?

527
00:39:59.397 --> 00:40:01.566
Murder. Same as you.

528
00:40:01.774 --> 00:40:02.942
Innocent?

529
00:40:05.653 --> 00:40:08.031
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

530
00:41:07.632 --> 00:41:08.883
<i>Where's the canary?</i>

531
00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:10.385
<i>How did you know?</i>

532
00:41:10.551 --> 00:41:12.887
<i>-How did I know what?
-So you don't know.</i>

533
00:41:13.054 --> 00:41:14.222
<i>Come.</i>

534
00:41:16.724 --> 00:41:18.851
<i>This is where the canary is.</i>

535
00:41:21.521 --> 00:41:24.857
<i>Quite a surprise to hear
a woman singing in my house, eh ?</i>

536
00:41:28.361 --> 00:41:29.737
<i>That's quite a...</i>

537
00:41:30.697 --> 00:41:32.365
<i>...surprise.</i>

538
00:41:36.661 --> 00:41:38.079
Wait, wait.

539
00:41:38.579 --> 00:41:40.081
Here she comes.

540
00:41:40.373 --> 00:41:43.251
I like this part when she
does that shit with her hair.

541
00:41:43.418 --> 00:41:46.170
I know. I've seen it
three times this month.

542
00:41:46.379 --> 00:41:48.256
<i>Gilda, are you decent?</i>

543
00:41:49.257 --> 00:41:50.425
<i>Me ?</i>

544
00:41:53.094 --> 00:41:54.887
God , I love it.

545
00:42:00.059 --> 00:42:03.062
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

546
00:42:04.063 --> 00:42:07.775
I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time. What do you want?

547
00:42:07.984 --> 00:42:10.111
-Rita Hayworth .
-What?

548
00:42:10.695 --> 00:42:12.071
Can you get her?

549
00:42:13.448 --> 00:42:16.826
<i>So this is Johnny Farrel.
I've heard a lot about you.</i>

550
00:42:18.077 --> 00:42:20.371
-Take a few weeks.
-Weeks?

551
00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:24.959
I don't have her stuffed down the front
of my pants right now, sorry to say.

552
00:42:25.543 --> 00:42:26.878
But I'll get her.

553
00:42:27.086 --> 00:42:28.421
Relax.

554
00:42:30.298 --> 00:42:31.591
Thanks.

555
00:42:51.986 --> 00:42:53.946
-Take a walk!
-I got to change reels!

556
00:42:54.155 --> 00:42:56.157
I said fuck off!

557
00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:03.664
Ain't you going to scream?

558
00:43:04.999 --> 00:43:06.876
Let's get this over with.

559
00:43:12.006 --> 00:43:14.008
He broke my fucking nose!

560
00:43:23.309 --> 00:43:24.519
Now...

561
00:43:25.019 --> 00:43:27.188
... I'm going to open my fly...

562
00:43:27.438 --> 00:43:30.191
...and you'll swallow
what I give you to swallow.

563
00:43:31.359 --> 00:43:33.945
Then you'll swallow Rooster's.
You broke his nose.

564
00:43:34.153 --> 00:43:36.280
He ought to have
something to show for it.

565
00:43:36.489 --> 00:43:38.366
You put it in my mouth ,
you lose it.

566
00:43:38.533 --> 00:43:41.160
No, you don't understand.

567
00:43:41.494 --> 00:43:44.539
Do that and I'll put all eight inches
of this in your ear.

568
00:43:44.705 --> 00:43:48.209
All right, but you should know
that sudden , serious brain injury...

569
00:43:48.376 --> 00:43:50.336
...causes the victim to bite down hard.

570
00:43:51.796 --> 00:43:54.048
In fact, I hear the bite reflex
is so strong ...

571
00:43:54.841 --> 00:43:57.301
...they have to pry
the victim's jaws open ...

572
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:58.886
...with a crowbar.

573
00:44:01.848 --> 00:44:03.391
Where do you get this shit?

574
00:44:03.558 --> 00:44:04.976
I read it.

575
00:44:06.394 --> 00:44:09.063
You know how to read ,
you ignorant fuck?

576
00:44:10.731 --> 00:44:12.024
Honey.

577
00:44:13.734 --> 00:44:15.486
You shouldn't!

578
00:44:18.156 --> 00:44:21.075
<i>Bogs didn't put anything
in Andy's mouth.</i>

579
00:44:21.325 --> 00:44:23.411
<i>And neither did his friends.</i>

580
00:44:23.828 --> 00:44:27.665
<i>What they did do is beat him
within an inch of his life.</i>

581
00:44:28.332 --> 00:44:30.835
<i>Andy spent a month in the infirmary.</i>

582
00:44:31.627 --> 00:44:34.172
<i>Bogs spent a week in the hole.</i>

583
00:44:38.259 --> 00:44:39.760
Time's up, Bogs.

584
00:44:43.598 --> 00:44:45.266
It's your world , boss.

585
00:44:48.519 --> 00:44:51.314
<i>Return to your cell blocks
for evening count.</i>

586
00:44:51.522 --> 00:44:54.192
<i>All prisoners report for lockdown.</i>

587
00:45:09.123 --> 00:45:10.124
What?

588
00:45:22.803 --> 00:45:25.306
-Where's he going?
-Grab his ankles.

589
00:45:28.643 --> 00:45:32.396
No! No! Help me!

590
00:45:36.067 --> 00:45:38.653
<i>Two things never happened again
after that.</i>

591
00:45:38.945 --> 00:45:42.073
<i>The Sisters never
laid a finger on Andy again.</i>

592
00:45:42.907 --> 00:45:45.409
<i>And Bogs never walked again.</i>

593
00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:50.081
<i>They transferred him
to a minimum-security hospital upstate.</i>

594
00:45:50.289 --> 00:45:52.792
<i>To my knowledge,
he lived out the rest of his days...</i>

595
00:45:52.959 --> 00:45:55.086
<i>...drinking his food through a straw.</i>

596
00:45:56.087 --> 00:46:00.174
Andy could use a nice "welcome back"
when he gets out of the infirmary.

597
00:46:01.926 --> 00:46:03.511
Sounds good to us.

598
00:46:03.761 --> 00:46:06.264
I figure we owe him that much
for the beer.

599
00:46:07.014 --> 00:46:09.267
The man likes to play chess.

600
00:46:09.767 --> 00:46:11.686
Let's get him some rocks.

601
00:46:44.302 --> 00:46:45.553
Guys!

602
00:46:46.304 --> 00:46:47.388
I got one.

603
00:46:47.555 --> 00:46:49.056
I got one. Look!

604
00:46:50.975 --> 00:46:55.062
Heywood , that isn't soapstone!
And it ain't alabaster either.

605
00:46:55.229 --> 00:46:57.148
What are you , a fucking geologist?

606
00:46:57.356 --> 00:46:59.066
He's right. It ain't.

607
00:46:59.275 --> 00:47:02.194
-What the hell is it then?
-It's a horse apple.

608
00:47:03.154 --> 00:47:05.573
-Bullshit!
-No, horseshit.

609
00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:07.241
Petrified.

610
00:47:12.747 --> 00:47:14.749
Oh , Jesus.

611
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:17.418
Damn!

612
00:47:17.752 --> 00:47:21.964
<i>Despite a few hitches,
the boys came through in fine style.</i>

613
00:47:22.173 --> 00:47:24.175
<i>And by the weekend
he was due back...</i>

614
00:47:24.383 --> 00:47:28.095
<i>...we had enough rocks saved up
to keep him busy till rapture.</i>

615
00:47:28.929 --> 00:47:31.432
<i>Also got a big shipment in that week.</i>

616
00:47:31.682 --> 00:47:32.808
<i>Cigarettes...</i>

617
00:47:33.017 --> 00:47:34.060
<i>...chewing gum...</i>

618
00:47:34.268 --> 00:47:35.728
<i>...sipping whisky...</i>

619
00:47:35.936 --> 00:47:39.315
<i>...playing cards with naked ladies
on them. You name it.</i>

620
00:47:39.523 --> 00:47:42.276
<i>And, of course, the most important item:</i>

621
00:47:44.111 --> 00:47:46.197
<i>Rita Hayworth herself.</i>

622
00:48:20.356 --> 00:48:23.109
-Okay, look alive!
-Open all tiers.

623
00:48:23.317 --> 00:48:25.569
Heads up. They're tossing cells.

624
00:48:25.778 --> 00:48:28.489
Heads up. They're tossing cells!

625
00:48:30.074 --> 00:48:31.575
119.

626
00:48:33.411 --> 00:48:35.079
123.

627
00:48:45.339 --> 00:48:46.340
On your feet.

628
00:48:49.009 --> 00:48:50.511
Face the wall.

629
00:49:24.628 --> 00:49:26.547
Turn around and face the warden.

630
00:49:33.137 --> 00:49:35.222
Pleased to see you reading this.

631
00:49:36.557 --> 00:49:38.476
Any favorite passages?

632
00:49:39.351 --> 00:49:41.729
"Watch ye, therefore,
for ye know not...

633
00:49:41.896 --> 00:49:44.148
...when the master
of the house cometh."

634
00:49:45.274 --> 00:49:47.443
Mark 13:35.

635
00:49:48.194 --> 00:49:50.070
I've always liked that one.

636
00:49:50.988 --> 00:49:52.656
But I prefer:

637
00:49:53.115 --> 00:49:54.992
"I am the light of the world.

638
00:49:55.451 --> 00:49:58.746
Ye that followeth me
shall have the light of life."

639
00:49:58.954 --> 00:50:01.582
John , chapter 8, verse 12.

640
00:50:01.874 --> 00:50:03.918
I hear you're good with numbers.

641
00:50:04.084 --> 00:50:05.085
How nice.

642
00:50:06.337 --> 00:50:08.255
Man should have a skill.

643
00:50:10.799 --> 00:50:11.842
Explain this.

644
00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:17.097
It's called a rock blanket.
For shaping and polishing rocks.

645
00:50:17.515 --> 00:50:19.433
A little hobby of mine.

646
00:50:30.277 --> 00:50:31.737
It's pretty clean.

647
00:50:31.987 --> 00:50:35.115
Some contraband here,
but nothing to get in a twist over.

648
00:50:39.453 --> 00:50:41.455
I can't say I approve of this.

649
00:50:43.082 --> 00:50:44.542
But I suppose...

650
00:50:46.627 --> 00:50:48.629
...exceptions can be made.

651
00:50:58.973 --> 00:51:00.307
Lock them up!

652
00:51:03.227 --> 00:51:04.812
I almost forgot.

653
00:51:05.229 --> 00:51:07.398
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

654
00:51:08.148 --> 00:51:10.067
Salvation lies within.

655
00:51:10.276 --> 00:51:11.318
Yes, sir.

656
00:51:19.868 --> 00:51:22.454
<i>Tossing cells was just an excuse.</i>

657
00:51:22.913 --> 00:51:24.164
<i>Truth is...</i>

658
00:51:24.331 --> 00:51:26.834
<i>...Norton wanted to size Andy up.</i>

659
00:51:40.514 --> 00:51:42.850
My wife made that in church group.

660
00:51:45.519 --> 00:51:46.812
Very nice, sir.

661
00:51:48.355 --> 00:51:49.857
You enjoy working the laundry?

662
00:51:51.525 --> 00:51:53.193
No, sir. Not especially.

663
00:51:53.527 --> 00:51:55.988
Perhaps we can find something more...

664
00:51:56.238 --> 00:51:58.699
... befitting a man of your education.

665
00:52:06.749 --> 00:52:08.250
Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?

666
00:52:10.085 --> 00:52:12.880
I thought I heard you out here.

667
00:52:13.547 --> 00:52:15.090
I've been reassigned to you.

668
00:52:15.382 --> 00:52:17.718
I know, they told me.

669
00:52:18.552 --> 00:52:20.596
Ain't that a kick in the head?

670
00:52:20.804 --> 00:52:23.098
Well , I'll give you the dime tour.

671
00:52:23.307 --> 00:52:24.475
Come on.

672
00:52:25.893 --> 00:52:27.603
Well , here she is.

673
00:52:27.811 --> 00:52:29.813
The Shawshank Prison Library.

674
00:52:30.481 --> 00:52:32.483
<i>National Geographics...</i>

675
00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:36.195
<i>...Reader's Digest</i> condensed books...

676
00:52:36.403 --> 00:52:37.988
...and Lou is L'Amour.

677
00:52:38.572 --> 00:52:40.407
<i>Look</i> magazine.

678
00:52:40.741 --> 00:52:43.077
Erle Stanley Gardners.

679
00:52:43.327 --> 00:52:46.789
Every evening I load up the cart
and make my rounds.

680
00:52:46.997 --> 00:52:49.667
I enter the names
on this clipboard here.

681
00:52:50.167 --> 00:52:52.920
Easy, peasy, Japanese-y.

682
00:52:53.629 --> 00:52:56.548
-Any questions?
-How long have you been librarian?

683
00:52:57.758 --> 00:53:01.762
I come here in '05,
and they made me librarian in 1912.

684
00:53:03.097 --> 00:53:05.265
And have you ever had an assistant?

685
00:53:05.432 --> 00:53:07.935
No. Not much to it, really.

686
00:53:08.686 --> 00:53:09.937
Why me? Why now?

687
00:53:10.354 --> 00:53:11.647
I don't know.

688
00:53:11.855 --> 00:53:14.900
But it'd be nice to have
some company down here.

689
00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:28.455
That's him. That's the one.

690
00:53:36.088 --> 00:53:37.256
I'm Dekins.

691
00:53:37.631 --> 00:53:39.299
I was...

692
00:53:39.967 --> 00:53:43.804
...thinking about setting up some kind of
trust fund for my kids' educations.

693
00:53:47.725 --> 00:53:49.184
I see.

694
00:53:54.314 --> 00:53:57.276
Why don't we have a seat
and talk it over.

695
00:54:00.487 --> 00:54:03.449
Do you have a piece of paper
and a pencil?

696
00:54:14.793 --> 00:54:16.086
Thanks.

697
00:54:16.754 --> 00:54:17.838
So...

698
00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:21.341
Mr. Dekins...

699
00:54:22.176 --> 00:54:24.261
And then Andy says, "Mr. Dekins...

700
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:27.473
...do you want your sons
to go to Harvard or Yale?"

701
00:54:27.681 --> 00:54:28.724
He didn't say that!

702
00:54:29.057 --> 00:54:31.560
As God as my witness!

703
00:54:31.852 --> 00:54:33.562
Dekins blinked for a second ...

704
00:54:33.771 --> 00:54:36.899
...then he laughed
and actually shook Andy's hand.

705
00:54:37.357 --> 00:54:39.693
-My ass!
-Shook his hand.

706
00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:42.738
I tell you , I near soiled myself!

707
00:54:42.946 --> 00:54:47.201
All he needed was a suit and tie
and a jiggly hula gal on his desk...

708
00:54:47.409 --> 00:54:50.037
... he'd have been
"Mr. Dufresne," if you please.

709
00:54:50.204 --> 00:54:51.872
Making a few friends?

710
00:54:53.165 --> 00:54:54.833
I wouldn't say "friends."

711
00:54:55.042 --> 00:54:58.879
I'm a convicted murderer
who provides sound financial planning.

712
00:54:59.046 --> 00:55:01.381
It's a wonderful pet to have.

713
00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:03.383
Got you out of the laundry, though.

714
00:55:03.926 --> 00:55:05.844
It might do more than that.

715
00:55:06.053 --> 00:55:08.764
How about expanding the library.
Get some new books.

716
00:55:08.972 --> 00:55:11.558
If you ask for something ,
ask for a pool table.

717
00:55:13.268 --> 00:55:16.271
How do you expect to do that? I mean ...

718
00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:19.441
...get new books in here,
"Mr. Dufresne, if you please."

719
00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:21.985
I'll ask the warden for funds.

720
00:55:22.861 --> 00:55:27.115
Six wardens have been through here
in my tenure, and I've learned ...

721
00:55:27.366 --> 00:55:29.743
...one immutable, universal truth :

722
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:32.204
Not one of them born whose asshole...

723
00:55:32.371 --> 00:55:36.416
...wouldn't pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you ask for funds.

724
00:55:37.292 --> 00:55:40.212
-The budget's stretched thin as it is.
-I see.

725
00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:43.841
Perhaps I could write the state senate
and request funds from them.

726
00:55:44.049 --> 00:55:48.136
They have only three ways to spend
the taxpayers' money for prisons:

727
00:55:48.345 --> 00:55:50.764
More walls, more bars, more guards.

728
00:55:50.973 --> 00:55:53.642
I'd like to try, with permission .
A letter a week.

729
00:55:53.851 --> 00:55:56.603
-They can't ignore me forever.
-Sure can.

730
00:55:56.854 --> 00:55:59.523
But you write your letters
if it makes you happy.

731
00:55:59.815 --> 00:56:02.442
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?

732
00:56:04.111 --> 00:56:06.905
<i>So Andy started writing
a letter a week...</i>

733
00:56:07.114 --> 00:56:08.699
<i>...just like he said.</i>

734
00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:15.497
<i>And, just like Norton said...</i>

735
00:56:15.706 --> 00:56:17.165
<i>...Andy got no answers.</i>

736
00:56:25.382 --> 00:56:30.304
<i>The following April, Andy did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.</i>

737
00:56:31.638 --> 00:56:33.891
<i>Year after that, he did them all...</i>

738
00:56:34.141 --> 00:56:36.059
<i>...including the warden's.</i>

739
00:56:37.811 --> 00:56:41.273
<i>Year after that,
they rescheduled the intramural season...</i>

740
00:56:41.481 --> 00:56:43.901
<i>...to coincide with tax season.</i>

741
00:56:45.485 --> 00:56:49.948
<i>The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.</i>

742
00:56:50.157 --> 00:56:51.491
So Moresby Prison ...

743
00:56:51.658 --> 00:56:53.952
... issued you a gun ,
but you paid for it.

744
00:56:54.161 --> 00:56:55.871
Right. The holster too.

745
00:56:56.079 --> 00:56:58.540
That's tax-deductible.
You can write that off.

746
00:56:58.749 --> 00:57:01.793
<i>Yes, sir.
Andy was a regular cottage industry.</i>

747
00:57:02.502 --> 00:57:07.007
<i>In fact, it got so busy at tax time,
he was allowed a staff.</i>

748
00:57:07.257 --> 00:57:09.718
Could you hand me
a stack of 1040s?

749
00:57:09.927 --> 00:57:14.765
<i>Got me out of the wood shop a month out
of the year, and that was fine by me.</i>

750
00:57:16.016 --> 00:57:19.186
<i>And still, he kept sending those letters.</i>

751
00:57:25.943 --> 00:57:26.985
It's Brooks.

752
00:57:28.111 --> 00:57:29.613
Watch the door.

753
00:57:29.863 --> 00:57:31.198
Please, Brooks.

754
00:57:31.365 --> 00:57:33.241
-Calm the fuck down .
-Stay back!

755
00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:36.328
-Stay back, goddamn it!
-What's going on?

756
00:57:36.536 --> 00:57:39.081
One second he's fine,
then out come the knife.

757
00:57:39.289 --> 00:57:41.083
We can talk about this, right?

758
00:57:41.375 --> 00:57:45.087
There's nothing to talk about.
I'll cut his fucking throat.

759
00:57:45.379 --> 00:57:47.089
What's he done to you?

760
00:57:47.297 --> 00:57:48.966
It's what they done!

761
00:57:49.466 --> 00:57:50.717
I got no choice.

762
00:57:51.218 --> 00:57:53.512
You won't hurt Heywood .
We all know that.

763
00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:56.181
-Right, Heywood?
-Sure. I know that.

764
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:59.726
He's a friend of yours,
and Brooks is a reasonable man.

765
00:57:59.893 --> 00:58:01.103
Right, guys?

766
00:58:02.062 --> 00:58:04.564
So put the knife down .
Brooks, look at me.

767
00:58:04.731 --> 00:58:07.067
Put the knife down.

768
00:58:08.986 --> 00:58:11.071
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

769
00:58:11.822 --> 00:58:14.157
Look at his neck. He's bleeding.

770
00:58:15.075 --> 00:58:16.535
It's the only--

771
00:58:16.743 --> 00:58:18.787
It's the only way they'd let me stay.

772
00:58:19.079 --> 00:58:21.415
This is crazy.
You don't want to do this.

773
00:58:21.665 --> 00:58:23.750
Put it-- Put it down.

774
00:58:32.509 --> 00:58:34.011
Take it easy.

775
00:58:34.678 --> 00:58:36.263
You'll be all right.

776
00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:38.890
Him? What about me?

777
00:58:39.099 --> 00:58:41.476
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!

778
00:58:41.685 --> 00:58:43.603
You've had worse from shaving.

779
00:58:43.770 --> 00:58:45.897
What did you do to set him off?

780
00:58:46.106 --> 00:58:48.316
Nothing. I come in here to say farewell.

781
00:58:48.942 --> 00:58:51.611
Ain't you heard?
His parole's come through.

782
00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:56.742
I just don't understand
what happened in there, that's all.

783
00:58:56.908 --> 00:58:59.745
Old man's crazy as a rat
in a tin shit house.

784
00:58:59.953 --> 00:59:01.830
That's enough out of you.

785
00:59:02.039 --> 00:59:04.791
-Heard he had you shitting your pants.
-Fuck you.

786
00:59:05.042 --> 00:59:06.251
Knock it off.

787
00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:08.628
Brooks ain't no bug.

788
00:59:12.466 --> 00:59:14.259
He's just institutionalized.

789
00:59:15.635 --> 00:59:17.554
"Institutionalized ," my ass.

790
00:59:17.763 --> 00:59:21.767
The man's been in here 50 years,
Heywood , 50 years!

791
00:59:21.975 --> 00:59:23.685
This is all he knows.

792
00:59:23.894 --> 00:59:26.188
In here, he's an important man ...

793
00:59:26.396 --> 00:59:27.481
...an educated man.

794
00:59:28.315 --> 00:59:30.233
Outside, he's nothing.

795
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:34.613
Just a used-up con
with arthritis in both hands.

796
00:59:34.821 --> 00:59:37.824
Probably couldn't get a library card
if he tried.

797
00:59:38.075 --> 00:59:39.826
You know what I'm trying to say?

798
00:59:40.077 --> 00:59:42.996
I do believe
you're talking out of your ass.

799
00:59:44.247 --> 00:59:46.500
You believe whatever you want.

800
00:59:47.084 --> 00:59:49.503
But I tell you these walls are funny.

801
00:59:51.088 --> 00:59:52.756
First you hate them.

802
00:59:54.591 --> 00:59:56.510
Then you get used to them.

803
00:59:58.428 --> 01:00:00.430
Enough time passes...

804
01:00:01.098 --> 01:00:03.100
...you get so you depend on them.

805
01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:06.311
That's "institutionalized ."

806
01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.813
Shit.

807
01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:10.774
-I could never get like that.
-Oh , yeah?

808
01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:14.152
Wait till you've been here
as long as Brooks.

809
01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:15.946
Goddamn right.

810
01:00:18.532 --> 01:00:20.450
They send you here for life...

811
01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:23.453
...that's exactly what they take.

812
01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:27.207
Part that counts, anyway.

813
01:00:34.798 --> 01:00:37.717
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

814
01:00:38.885 --> 01:00:40.554
You go on now.

815
01:00:41.805 --> 01:00:43.306
You're free.

816
01:00:44.558 --> 01:00:46.143
You're free.

817
01:01:05.162 --> 01:01:06.830
Good luck, Brooksie.

818
01:01:09.124 --> 01:01:11.209
Take care of yourself, Brooks.

819
01:01:44.784 --> 01:01:46.286
<i>Dear fellas:</i>

820
01:01:46.578 --> 01:01:50.790
<i>I can't believe how fast things move
on the outside.</i>

821
01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:54.753
Watch it, old-timer! Want to get killed?

822
01:01:55.962 --> 01:01:59.466
<i>I saw an automobile once
when I was a kid...</i>

823
01:02:00.133 --> 01:02:02.552
<i>...but now they're everywhere.</i>

824
01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:10.518
<i>The world went and got itself
in a big damn hurry.</i>

825
01:02:26.326 --> 01:02:30.121
<i>The parole board
got me into this halfway house...</i>

826
01:02:30.413 --> 01:02:32.082
<i>...called "The Brewer"...</i>

827
01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:33.458
<i>...and a job...</i>

828
01:02:33.667 --> 01:02:36.628
<i>...bagging groceries at the Food-Way.</i>

829
01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:40.590
<i>It's hard work and I try to keep up...</i>

830
01:02:40.799 --> 01:02:43.176
<i>...but my hands hurt most of the time.</i>

831
01:02:43.468 --> 01:02:45.428
Make sure your man double-bags.

832
01:02:45.637 --> 01:02:47.681
Last time, the bottom near came out.

833
01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:51.268
Make sure you double-bag
like the lady says. Understand?

834
01:02:51.476 --> 01:02:52.852
Yes, sir. Surely will.

835
01:02:53.019 --> 01:02:56.564
<i>I don't think the store manager
likes me very much.</i>

836
01:02:59.567 --> 01:03:03.863
<i>Sometimes after work,
I go to the park and feed the birds.</i>

837
01:03:04.322 --> 01:03:05.824
<i>I keep thinking...</i>

838
01:03:06.032 --> 01:03:09.369
<i>...Jake might just show up
and say hello.</i>

839
01:03:09.995 --> 01:03:11.997
<i>But he never does.</i>

840
01:03:13.206 --> 01:03:18.044
<i>I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay
and making new friends.</i>

841
01:03:21.673 --> 01:03:24.384
<i>I have trouble sleeping at night.</i>

842
01:03:24.718 --> 01:03:27.971
<i>I have bad dreams, like I'm falling.</i>

843
01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:30.473
<i>I wake up scared.</i>

844
01:03:30.682 --> 01:03:34.894
<i>Sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where I am.</i>

845
01:03:36.396 --> 01:03:41.318
<i>Maybe I should get me a gun and rob
the Food-Way so they'd send me home.</i>

846
01:03:41.609 --> 01:03:45.947
<i>I could shoot the manager while
I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.</i>

847
01:03:47.615 --> 01:03:51.619
<i>I guess I'm too old
for that sort of nonsense anymore.</i>

848
01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:53.580
<i>I don't like it here.</i>

849
01:03:53.788 --> 01:03:57.792
<i>I'm tired of being afraid all the time.
I've decided...</i>

850
01:03:58.626 --> 01:04:00.295
<i>...not to stay.</i>

851
01:04:11.222 --> 01:04:13.767
<i>I doubt they'll kick up any fuss...</i>

852
01:04:13.975 --> 01:04:17.479
<i>...not for an old crook like me.</i>

853
01:05:19.958 --> 01:05:24.212
"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss,
not for an old crook like me.

854
01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:29.092
P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry
I put a knife to his throat.

855
01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:31.636
No hard feelings. Brooks."

856
01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:44.065
He should have died in here.

857
01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:51.030
What the fuck have you done?

858
01:05:51.197 --> 01:05:53.867
It's a goddamn mess,
I'll tell you that.

859
01:05:59.414 --> 01:06:03.168
-What's all this?
-You tell me. They're addressed to you.

860
01:06:04.419 --> 01:06:05.753
Take it.

861
01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:15.805
"Dear Mr. Dufresne:

862
01:06:16.931 --> 01:06:18.892
In response to your repeated inquiries...

863
01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:23.396
...the state has allocated the enclosed
funds for your library project."

864
01:06:24.147 --> 01:06:25.982
This is $200.

865
01:06:26.191 --> 01:06:30.195
"In addition , the library district
has generously responded ...

866
01:06:30.403 --> 01:06:32.947
...with a donation of used books
and sundries.

867
01:06:33.156 --> 01:06:37.285
We trust this will fill your needs.
We now consider the matter closed.

868
01:06:37.494 --> 01:06:39.370
Please stop sending us letters."

869
01:06:39.537 --> 01:06:42.207
Clear all this out
before the warden gets back.

870
01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:43.583
Yes, sir.

871
01:06:47.879 --> 01:06:49.047
Good for you , Andy.

872
01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:56.262
It only took six years.

873
01:06:57.847 --> 01:07:00.600
From now on , I'll write two
letters a week instead of one.

874
01:07:00.767 --> 01:07:04.103
I believe you're crazy enough .
Get this stuff out...

875
01:07:04.395 --> 01:07:06.814
... like he said .
I've got to pinch a loaf.

876
01:07:07.023 --> 01:07:08.483
When I come back...

877
01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:10.443
...this is all gone, all right?

878
01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.618
Do you hear that?

879
01:09:09.354 --> 01:09:10.521
Dufresne!

880
01:09:13.066 --> 01:09:14.567
Andy, let me out!

881
01:09:21.449 --> 01:09:26.412
<i>I have no idea to this day what those
two Italian ladies were singing about.</i>

882
01:09:26.704 --> 01:09:28.915
<i>Truth is, I don't want to know.</i>

883
01:09:29.123 --> 01:09:31.626
<i>Some things are best left unsaid.</i>

884
01:09:35.213 --> 01:09:37.924
<i>I like to think it was something
so beautiful...</i>

885
01:09:38.132 --> 01:09:40.259
<i>...it can't be expressed in words...</i>

886
01:09:40.468 --> 01:09:43.388
<i>...and makes your heart ache
because of it.</i>

887
01:09:45.056 --> 01:09:47.558
<i>I tell you, those voices soared...</i>

888
01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:52.105
<i>...higher and farther than anybody
in a gray place dares to dream.</i>

889
01:09:52.313 --> 01:09:55.692
<i>It was like a beautiful bird
flapped into our drab cage...</i>

890
01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:58.653
<i>...and made those walls dissolve away.</i>

891
01:09:59.112 --> 01:10:01.280
<i>And for the briefest of moments...</i>

892
01:10:01.489 --> 01:10:04.492
<i>...every last man at Shawshank felt free.</i>

893
01:10:07.078 --> 01:10:09.747
<i>It pissed the warden off
something awful.</i>

894
01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.041
Open the door.

895
01:10:14.961 --> 01:10:16.713
Open it up!

896
01:10:18.005 --> 01:10:20.758
Dufresne, open this door!

897
01:10:22.093 --> 01:10:23.302
Turn that off!

898
01:10:30.351 --> 01:10:32.812
I am warning you. Turn that off!

899
01:10:50.538 --> 01:10:52.081
You're mine now.

900
01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:02.759
<i>Andy got two weeks in the hole
for that little stunt.</i>

901
01:11:02.967 --> 01:11:04.552
On your feet.

902
01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.139
-Hey, look who's here.
-Maestro!

903
01:11:09.891 --> 01:11:13.561
You couldn't play something good , huh?
Like Hank Williams?

904
01:11:13.895 --> 01:11:16.689
They broke the door down
before I could take requests.

905
01:11:16.898 --> 01:11:20.026
-Was it worth two weeks?
-Easiest time I ever did.

906
01:11:20.234 --> 01:11:24.447
-No such thing as easy time in the hole.
-A week in the hole is like a year.

907
01:11:24.655 --> 01:11:27.950
-Damn straight.
-I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

908
01:11:28.159 --> 01:11:31.120
So they let you tote
that record player down there, huh?

909
01:11:33.539 --> 01:11:34.916
It was in here.

910
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:37.001
In here.

911
01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:40.213
That's the beauty of music. They...

912
01:11:40.421 --> 01:11:42.757
...can't get that from you.

913
01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:48.679
Haven't you ever felt
that way about music?

914
01:11:50.473 --> 01:11:53.601
Well , I played a mean harmonica
as a younger man.

915
01:11:54.644 --> 01:11:56.354
Lost interest in it, though.

916
01:11:56.562 --> 01:11:58.147
Didn't make much sense in here.

917
01:11:58.481 --> 01:12:00.483
Here's where it makes the most sense.

918
01:12:01.025 --> 01:12:03.069
You need it so you don't forget.

919
01:12:03.653 --> 01:12:04.946
Forget?

920
01:12:05.238 --> 01:12:08.324
Forget that there are...

921
01:12:08.533 --> 01:12:09.951
... places...

922
01:12:10.451 --> 01:12:14.288
... in the world
that aren't made out of stone.

923
01:12:15.289 --> 01:12:16.791
There's something ...

924
01:12:17.124 --> 01:12:18.543
... inside...

925
01:12:18.793 --> 01:12:20.753
...that they can't get to...

926
01:12:20.962 --> 01:12:22.380
...that they can't touch.

927
01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.298
That's yours.

928
01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:27.426
What are you talking about?

929
01:12:28.469 --> 01:12:29.720
Hope.

930
01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:32.098
Hope.

931
01:12:34.058 --> 01:12:36.060
Let me tell you something , my friend.

932
01:12:36.853 --> 01:12:39.146
Hope is a dangerous thing.

933
01:12:40.314 --> 01:12:42.650
Hope can drive a man insane.

934
01:12:43.401 --> 01:12:45.528
It's got no use on the inside.

935
01:12:45.736 --> 01:12:47.947
You'd better get used to that idea.

936
01:12:50.449 --> 01:12:51.951
Like Brooks did?

937
01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:18.311
Sit down.

938
01:13:23.649 --> 01:13:26.944
Says here that you've served
30 years of a life sentence.

939
01:13:28.112 --> 01:13:30.156
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

940
01:13:30.364 --> 01:13:31.616
Oh , yes, sir.

941
01:13:32.867 --> 01:13:34.201
Without a doubt.

942
01:13:35.369 --> 01:13:37.788
I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

943
01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:41.709
No danger to society here.

944
01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:43.794
God's honest truth.

945
01:13:46.339 --> 01:13:48.466
Absolutely rehabilitated.

946
01:13:58.434 --> 01:13:59.769
Thirty years.

947
01:14:01.729 --> 01:14:03.648
Jesus, when you say it like that...

948
01:14:04.523 --> 01:14:06.317
You wonder where it went.

949
01:14:08.736 --> 01:14:10.905
I wonder where 10 years went.

950
01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:16.911
Here.

951
01:14:17.370 --> 01:14:20.081
A little parole rejection present.

952
01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:23.042
Go ahead and open it.

953
01:14:24.168 --> 01:14:26.212
Went through one of your competitors.

954
01:14:26.379 --> 01:14:29.548
I hope you don't mind .
I wanted it to be a surprise.

955
01:14:39.558 --> 01:14:41.060
It's very pretty.

956
01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:43.980
Thank you.

957
01:14:46.565 --> 01:14:48.025
You going to play it?

958
01:14:52.571 --> 01:14:53.864
No.

959
01:14:57.451 --> 01:14:58.869
Not right now.

960
01:15:16.554 --> 01:15:17.638
Roll in!

961
01:15:53.841 --> 01:15:55.092
Lights out!

962
01:16:29.668 --> 01:16:31.837
<i>Andy was as good as his word.</i>

963
01:16:32.171 --> 01:16:34.965
<i>He wrote two letters a week
instead of one.</i>

964
01:16:37.009 --> 01:16:41.138
<i>In 1959, the state senate
finally clued in to the fact...</i>

965
01:16:41.347 --> 01:16:44.517
<i>...they couldn't buy him off
with just a $200 check.</i>

966
01:16:44.683 --> 01:16:49.021
<i>Appropriations Committee
voted an annual payment of $500...</i>

967
01:16:49.188 --> 01:16:51.107
<i>...just to shut him up.</i>

968
01:16:51.315 --> 01:16:54.318
<i>And you'd be amazed how far
Andy could stretch it.</i>

969
01:16:54.527 --> 01:16:57.446
<i>He made deals with book clubs,
charity groups.</i>

970
01:16:57.655 --> 01:17:00.407
<i>He bought remaindered books
by the pound...</i>

971
01:17:00.908 --> 01:17:02.451
<i>Treasure island.</i>

972
01:17:02.993 --> 01:17:04.328
Robert Louis--

973
01:17:04.537 --> 01:17:05.538
Stevenson.

974
01:17:05.746 --> 01:17:07.164
Fiction , adventure.

975
01:17:09.708 --> 01:17:10.751
What's next?

976
01:17:10.918 --> 01:17:14.004
I got here Auto Repair...

977
01:17:14.713 --> 01:17:15.881
...and Soap Carving.

978
01:17:16.090 --> 01:17:19.343
Trade skills and hobbies.
Under "Educational ," behind you.

979
01:17:19.552 --> 01:17:21.387
<i>Count of Monte Crisco.</i>

980
01:17:21.887 --> 01:17:24.181
That's "Cristo," you dumb shit.

981
01:17:25.266 --> 01:17:26.267
By Alexandree...

982
01:17:26.725 --> 01:17:28.018
... Dum-ass.

983
01:17:28.352 --> 01:17:29.395
Dumb-ass.

984
01:17:31.689 --> 01:17:32.731
Dumb-ass?

985
01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:37.611
Dumas. Know what that's about?

986
01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:41.907
You'd like it. It's about a prison break.

987
01:17:42.074 --> 01:17:45.953
We ought to file that
under "Educational" too, oughtn't we?

988
01:17:46.829 --> 01:17:50.916
<i>The rest of us did our best
to pitch in when and where we could.</i>

989
01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.252
<i>By the year Kennedy was shot...</i>

990
01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:58.007
<i>...Andy had transformed a storage room
smelling of turpentine...</i>

991
01:17:58.299 --> 01:18:01.427
<i>...into the best prison library
in New England...</i>

992
01:18:02.094 --> 01:18:05.055
<i>...complete with a fine selection
of Hank Williams.</i>

993
01:18:12.438 --> 01:18:14.356
<i>That was also when Warden Norton...</i>

994
01:18:14.565 --> 01:18:17.484
<i>...instituted his famous
"inside Out" program.</i>

995
01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:20.029
<i>You may remember reading about it.</i>

996
01:18:20.279 --> 01:18:23.365
<i>It made the papers
and got his picture in</i> Look <i>magazine.</i>

997
01:18:23.574 --> 01:18:24.909
It's no free ride...

998
01:18:25.075 --> 01:18:28.287
... but rather a genuine
progressive advance...

999
01:18:28.495 --> 01:18:30.998
... in corrections and rehabilitation.

1000
01:18:31.332 --> 01:18:33.876
Our inmates, properly supervised ...

1001
01:18:34.084 --> 01:18:36.712
...will be put to work
outside these walls...

1002
01:18:36.921 --> 01:18:40.007
... performing all manner
of public service.

1003
01:18:40.174 --> 01:18:42.968
These men can learn the value
of an honest day's labor...

1004
01:18:43.177 --> 01:18:46.972
...while providing a valuable service
to the community...

1005
01:18:47.181 --> 01:18:51.894
...and at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer.

1006
01:18:52.311 --> 01:18:54.647
<i>Of course he didn't tell the press...</i>

1007
01:18:54.855 --> 01:18:58.317
<i>...that "bare minimum of expense "
is a fairly loose term.</i>

1008
01:18:58.525 --> 01:19:01.570
<i>There are 100 different ways
to skim off the top.</i>

1009
01:19:01.779 --> 01:19:04.281
<i>Men, materials, you name it.</i>

1010
01:19:04.615 --> 01:19:07.493
<i>And oh, my Lord,
how the money rolled in!</i>

1011
01:19:07.701 --> 01:19:10.246
At this rate,
you'll put me out of business.

1012
01:19:10.454 --> 01:19:14.875
With this pool of slave labor,
you can underbid any contractor in town.

1013
01:19:15.459 --> 01:19:18.420
We're providing
a valuable community service.

1014
01:19:18.629 --> 01:19:22.299
That's fine for the papers,
but I've got a family to feed.

1015
01:19:24.969 --> 01:19:26.512
We go back a long way.

1016
01:19:27.805 --> 01:19:32.726
I need this highway contract.
I don't get it and I go under. That's a fact.

1017
01:19:33.644 --> 01:19:35.437
You have some of this fine pie...

1018
01:19:35.688 --> 01:19:39.024
... my missus made for you .
You think about that.

1019
01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:49.994
I wouldn't worry too much
about this contract.

1020
01:19:50.202 --> 01:19:53.289
It seems to me I already got my boys
committed elsewhere.

1021
01:19:55.249 --> 01:19:58.335
You be sure and thank Maisie
for this fine pie.

1022
01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:01.588
<i>And behind every shady deal...</i>

1023
01:20:01.922 --> 01:20:04.550
<i>...behind every dollar earned...</i>

1024
01:20:04.842 --> 01:20:07.886
<i>...there was Andy, keeping the books.</i>

1025
01:20:08.304 --> 01:20:09.555
Two deposits.

1026
01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:13.934
Maine National and New England First.
Night drops as always, sir.

1027
01:20:44.131 --> 01:20:48.469
Get my stuff to the laundry. Two suits
for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.

1028
01:20:48.927 --> 01:20:52.473
If they over-starch my shirts again ,
they'll hear from me.

1029
01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:54.016
How do I look?

1030
01:20:55.059 --> 01:20:57.561
-Very nice.
-Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1031
01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:59.271
Governor will be there.

1032
01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:02.149
You want the rest of this?

1033
01:21:03.484 --> 01:21:05.444
Woman can't bake worth shit.

1034
01:21:06.653 --> 01:21:07.988
Thank you , sir.

1035
01:21:10.824 --> 01:21:14.078
He's got his fingers
in a lot of pies, from what I hear.

1036
01:21:14.286 --> 01:21:19.124
He's got scams you haven't even
dreamed of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

1037
01:21:19.291 --> 01:21:21.668
A river of dirty money
running through here.

1038
01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:25.714
Sooner or later, he'll have to
explain where it came from.

1039
01:21:25.923 --> 01:21:27.674
That's where I come in.

1040
01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:30.594
I channel it. Filter it. Funnel it.

1041
01:21:30.803 --> 01:21:33.639
Stocks, securities,
tax-free municipals.

1042
01:21:33.972 --> 01:21:37.476
I send it out into the real world ,
and when it comes back...

1043
01:21:37.684 --> 01:21:40.646
-Clean as a virgin's honeypot, huh?
-Cleaner.

1044
01:21:41.271 --> 01:21:44.858
By the time Norton retires,
I'll have made him a millionaire.

1045
01:21:47.194 --> 01:21:51.532
If they ever catch on , he'll wind up
in here wearing a number himself.

1046
01:21:51.824 --> 01:21:54.493
I thought you had
more faith in me than that.

1047
01:21:54.701 --> 01:21:57.746
I know you're good ,
but all that paper leaves a trail.

1048
01:21:58.122 --> 01:21:59.957
Now anybody gets curious--

1049
01:22:00.124 --> 01:22:02.543
FBI , IRS, whatever.

1050
01:22:03.001 --> 01:22:04.294
--It'll lead to somebody.

1051
01:22:04.503 --> 01:22:08.340
Sure it is, but not to me,
and certainly not to the warden.

1052
01:22:12.719 --> 01:22:13.720
All right, who?

1053
01:22:13.887 --> 01:22:15.514
Randall Stevens.

1054
01:22:16.014 --> 01:22:17.015
Who?

1055
01:22:17.182 --> 01:22:19.184
The "silent" silent partner.

1056
01:22:19.393 --> 01:22:22.479
He's the guilty one,
the man with the bank accounts.

1057
01:22:22.688 --> 01:22:24.857
It's where the filtering
process starts.

1058
01:22:25.023 --> 01:22:27.901
They trace anything ,
it'll just lead to him.

1059
01:22:28.527 --> 01:22:29.736
But who is he?

1060
01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:33.907
He's a phantom , an apparition .
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1061
01:22:35.033 --> 01:22:36.201
I conjured him ...

1062
01:22:36.368 --> 01:22:37.744
...out of thin air.

1063
01:22:38.537 --> 01:22:41.290
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1064
01:22:44.376 --> 01:22:46.712
You can't just make a person up.

1065
01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:50.048
Sure you can ,
if you know how the system works.

1066
01:22:50.549 --> 01:22:53.385
It's amazing what you
can accomplish by mail.

1067
01:22:53.719 --> 01:22:56.346
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate...

1068
01:22:56.555 --> 01:22:58.682
...driver's license, Social Security.

1069
01:22:58.932 --> 01:22:59.933
You're shitting me.

1070
01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:03.520
If they trace any accounts,
they'll wind up chasing ...

1071
01:23:03.729 --> 01:23:05.439
...a figment of my imagination.

1072
01:23:05.647 --> 01:23:07.649
Well , I'll be damned!

1073
01:23:08.984 --> 01:23:10.736
Did I say you were good?

1074
01:23:11.069 --> 01:23:12.738
Shit, you are Rembrandt.

1075
01:23:13.447 --> 01:23:15.199
The funny thing is...

1076
01:23:15.407 --> 01:23:19.495
...on the outside, I was an honest man ,
straight as an arrow.

1077
01:23:19.912 --> 01:23:22.247
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1078
01:23:31.089 --> 01:23:32.424
Ever bother you?

1079
01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:36.929
I don't run the scams.
I just process the profits.

1080
01:23:37.179 --> 01:23:39.181
A fine line, maybe...

1081
01:23:39.765 --> 01:23:41.808
... but I also built that library...

1082
01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:45.062
...and used it to help guys
get their high school diploma.

1083
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:47.481
Why do you think
he lets me do all that?

1084
01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:49.900
Keep you happy and doing the laundry.

1085
01:23:50.108 --> 01:23:51.568
Money instead of sheets.

1086
01:23:51.944 --> 01:23:54.530
Well , I work cheap.
That's the trade off.

1087
01:24:11.797 --> 01:24:14.424
<i>Tommy Williams
came to Shawshank in 1905...</i>

1088
01:24:14.633 --> 01:24:16.885
<i>...on a two-year stretch for B and E.</i>

1089
01:24:17.135 --> 01:24:19.471
<i>That's breaking and entering to you.</i>

1090
01:24:19.721 --> 01:24:23.976
<i>Cops caught him sneaking TV sets
out the back door of a JC Penney.</i>

1091
01:24:24.393 --> 01:24:25.686
<i>Young punk.</i>

1092
01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:27.521
<i>Mr. Rock 'n' Roll...</i>

1093
01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:29.273
<i>...cocky as hell.</i>

1094
01:24:29.481 --> 01:24:31.858
Come on , old boys.
Moving like molasses!

1095
01:24:32.109 --> 01:24:33.860
Making me look bad.

1096
01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:35.862
<i>We liked him immediately.</i>

1097
01:24:36.113 --> 01:24:39.825
I'm backing out the door
and I got the TV like this.

1098
01:24:40.158 --> 01:24:43.787
A big old thing. I couldn't see shit.
Then I hear this voice.

1099
01:24:44.413 --> 01:24:46.373
"Freeze, kid , hands in the air."

1100
01:24:46.582 --> 01:24:51.044
I was standing there, holding onto
that TV. Finally the voice says:

1101
01:24:51.253 --> 01:24:55.048
"You hear what I said , boy?"
I say, "Yes, sir. I did.

1102
01:24:55.257 --> 01:24:58.719
But if I drop this, you get me
on destruction of property too."

1103
01:25:03.181 --> 01:25:05.517
You done some stretch
in Cashman , right?

1104
01:25:06.018 --> 01:25:09.980
Yeah , that was an easy piece of time,
let me tell you.

1105
01:25:10.230 --> 01:25:12.190
Weekend furloughs. Work programs.

1106
01:25:12.858 --> 01:25:14.151
Not like here.

1107
01:25:14.318 --> 01:25:16.069
Sounds like you done time all over.

1108
01:25:16.528 --> 01:25:18.905
I've been in and out since I was 13.

1109
01:25:19.114 --> 01:25:21.325
Name it, chances are I've been there.

1110
01:25:21.533 --> 01:25:24.202
Perhaps you should try a new profession.

1111
01:25:25.621 --> 01:25:27.205
What I mean is...

1112
01:25:27.539 --> 01:25:30.500
...you're not a very good thief.
You should try something else.

1113
01:25:31.209 --> 01:25:34.421
Yeah , what the hell
you know about it, Capone?

1114
01:25:34.838 --> 01:25:36.423
What are you in for?

1115
01:25:36.715 --> 01:25:37.716
Me?

1116
01:25:40.135 --> 01:25:41.803
A lawyer fucked me.

1117
01:25:45.724 --> 01:25:48.685
Everybody's innocent in here.
Don't you know that?

1118
01:25:56.568 --> 01:26:00.989
<i>As it turned out, Tommy had himself
a young wife and a new baby girl.</i>

1119
01:26:01.573 --> 01:26:03.700
<i>Maybe he thought of them
on the streets...</i>

1120
01:26:03.909 --> 01:26:06.411
<i>...or his child growing up
not knowing her daddy.</i>

1121
01:26:06.703 --> 01:26:08.080
<i>Whatever it was...</i>

1122
01:26:08.413 --> 01:26:10.832
<i>...something lit a fire
under that boy's ass.</i>

1123
01:26:14.670 --> 01:26:17.547
Thought I might try for
my high school equivalency.

1124
01:26:17.756 --> 01:26:20.258
Hear you helped
a couple of fellas with that.

1125
01:26:21.593 --> 01:26:23.845
I don't waste time with losers, Tommy.

1126
01:26:25.263 --> 01:26:27.766
I ain't no goddamn loser.

1127
01:26:29.476 --> 01:26:31.311
-You mean that?
-Yeah.

1128
01:26:32.979 --> 01:26:34.439
You really mean that?

1129
01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:36.817
Yes, sir, I do.

1130
01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:38.985
Good. Because if we do this...

1131
01:26:39.194 --> 01:26:43.156
...we do it all the way,
a hundred percent, nothing half-assed.

1132
01:26:43.407 --> 01:26:45.200
Thing is, see...

1133
01:26:46.451 --> 01:26:47.994
... I don't read so good.

1134
01:26:49.162 --> 01:26:50.288
"Well ."

1135
01:26:52.290 --> 01:26:54.000
You don't read ...

1136
01:26:54.251 --> 01:26:55.794
...so well.

1137
01:26:58.130 --> 01:26:59.631
We'll get to that.

1138
01:27:04.052 --> 01:27:06.179
<i>So Andy took Tommy under his wing.</i>

1139
01:27:06.388 --> 01:27:09.015
<i>Started walking him through his ABC's.</i>

1140
01:27:11.143 --> 01:27:13.353
<i>Tommy took to it pretty well too.</i>

1141
01:27:13.645 --> 01:27:16.398
<i>Boy found brains he never knew he had.</i>

1142
01:27:18.734 --> 01:27:22.154
<i>Before long, Andy started him
on his course requirements.</i>

1143
01:27:22.362 --> 01:27:24.030
<i>He really liked the kid.</i>

1144
01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:27.826
<i>Gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap.</i>

1145
01:27:28.326 --> 01:27:30.579
<i>But that wasn't the only reason.</i>

1146
01:27:31.288 --> 01:27:33.498
<i>Prison time is slow time.</i>

1147
01:27:33.957 --> 01:27:36.543
<i>So you do what you can to keep going.</i>

1148
01:27:36.877 --> 01:27:38.962
<i>Some fellas collect stamps.</i>

1149
01:27:39.337 --> 01:27:41.840
<i>Others build matchstick houses.</i>

1150
01:27:42.424 --> 01:27:45.093
<i>Andy built a library.</i>

1151
01:27:45.594 --> 01:27:47.512
<i>Now he needed a new project.</i>

1152
01:27:48.388 --> 01:27:49.890
<i>Tommy was it.</i>

1153
01:27:50.515 --> 01:27:54.519
<i>It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.</i>

1154
01:27:55.061 --> 01:27:58.315
<i>The same reason he hung
his fantasy girlies on the wall.</i>

1155
01:27:59.191 --> 01:28:00.484
<i>In prison...</i>

1156
01:28:00.734 --> 01:28:04.488
<i>...a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.</i>

1157
01:28:05.238 --> 01:28:10.118
<i>By 1900, right about the time Tommy
was getting ready to take his exams...</i>

1158
01:28:10.368 --> 01:28:12.537
<i>...it was lovely Raquel.</i>

1159
01:28:29.095 --> 01:28:30.096
Time.

1160
01:28:36.144 --> 01:28:37.395
Well?

1161
01:28:38.730 --> 01:28:40.899
Well , it's for shit.

1162
01:28:41.399 --> 01:28:44.236
I wasted a whole year
of my time with this bullshit.

1163
01:28:44.402 --> 01:28:45.904
It's probably not that bad.

1164
01:28:46.112 --> 01:28:50.367
I didn't get a thing right.
It might as well have been in Chinese.

1165
01:28:50.575 --> 01:28:52.285
Let's see how the score comes out.

1166
01:28:52.494 --> 01:28:55.455
I'll tell you
how the goddamn score comes out.

1167
01:28:57.415 --> 01:28:58.750
Two points, right there!

1168
01:28:58.959 --> 01:29:00.544
There's your goddamn score!

1169
01:29:00.752 --> 01:29:04.464
Goddamn cats crawling up trees,
5 times 5 is 25...

1170
01:29:05.423 --> 01:29:07.050
Fuck this place!

1171
01:29:07.259 --> 01:29:08.426
Fuck it!

1172
01:29:27.571 --> 01:29:28.822
I feel bad.

1173
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:30.240
I let him down.

1174
01:29:30.448 --> 01:29:32.158
That's crap, kid.

1175
01:29:32.367 --> 01:29:33.702
He's proud of you.

1176
01:29:34.035 --> 01:29:36.913
We're old friends,
I know him as good as anybody.

1177
01:29:37.122 --> 01:29:38.665
Smart fellow, ain't he?

1178
01:29:38.874 --> 01:29:42.002
Smart as they come.
He was a banker on the outside.

1179
01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:44.462
What's he in here for anyway?

1180
01:29:44.754 --> 01:29:45.755
Murder.

1181
01:29:47.215 --> 01:29:48.592
The hell , you say.

1182
01:29:50.719 --> 01:29:53.054
You wouldn't think it
to look at the guy.

1183
01:29:54.306 --> 01:29:58.393
Caught his wife in bed
with some golf pro. Greased them both.

1184
01:30:06.401 --> 01:30:07.777
What?

1185
01:30:08.737 --> 01:30:11.323
About four years ago...

1186
01:30:11.573 --> 01:30:14.826
... I was in Thomaston
on a two-to-three stretch.

1187
01:30:15.327 --> 01:30:16.620
I stole a car.

1188
01:30:16.995 --> 01:30:18.997
It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1189
01:30:19.664 --> 01:30:21.875
About six months left to go...

1190
01:30:22.167 --> 01:30:24.085
... I get a new cellmate in.

1191
01:30:24.794 --> 01:30:26.421
EImo Blatch.

1192
01:30:27.130 --> 01:30:28.465
Big , twitchy fucker.

1193
01:30:29.341 --> 01:30:32.844
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.
You know what I'm saying?

1194
01:30:33.011 --> 01:30:35.764
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1195
01:30:36.014 --> 01:30:38.308
Said he pulled hundreds of jobs.

1196
01:30:38.516 --> 01:30:43.438
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.
You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.

1197
01:30:44.522 --> 01:30:49.152
Talked all the time too.
That's the other thing. He never shut up.

1198
01:30:49.361 --> 01:30:50.987
Places he'd been in ...

1199
01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:54.366
...jobs he'd pulled , women he fucked.

1200
01:30:54.574 --> 01:30:56.785
Even people he killed.

1201
01:30:58.036 --> 01:31:00.830
People who "gave him shit."

1202
01:31:01.456 --> 01:31:03.041
That's how he put it.

1203
01:31:05.627 --> 01:31:07.712
So one night, like a joke...

1204
01:31:08.797 --> 01:31:12.300
... I say to him ,
"EImo, who did you kill?"

1205
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:13.677
So he says:

1206
01:31:13.843 --> 01:31:17.806
I got me this job one time,
busing tables at a country club...

1207
01:31:18.473 --> 01:31:22.394
...so I could case all these big
rich pricks that come in.

1208
01:31:24.479 --> 01:31:26.481
So I pick out this guy...

1209
01:31:27.399 --> 01:31:28.942
...go in one night...

1210
01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:30.902
...and do his place.

1211
01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:33.655
He wakes up...

1212
01:31:34.406 --> 01:31:36.157
...and gives me shit.

1213
01:31:37.242 --> 01:31:38.910
So I killed him.

1214
01:31:40.662 --> 01:31:43.498
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1215
01:31:44.916 --> 01:31:47.168
And that's the best part.

1216
01:31:47.836 --> 01:31:50.296
She's fucking this prick, see...

1217
01:31:50.505 --> 01:31:53.591
...this golf pro,
but she's married to some other guy.

1218
01:31:54.175 --> 01:31:56.761
Some hotshot banker.

1219
01:31:58.179 --> 01:32:00.682
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1220
01:32:12.152 --> 01:32:16.031
I have to say that's
the most amazing story I ever heard.

1221
01:32:17.282 --> 01:32:19.784
What amazes me most
is you'd be taken in by it.

1222
01:32:20.535 --> 01:32:21.536
Sir?

1223
01:32:23.747 --> 01:32:27.333
It's obvious this fellow Williams
is impressed with you.

1224
01:32:27.959 --> 01:32:31.880
He hears your tale of woe
and naturally wants to cheer you up.

1225
01:32:32.088 --> 01:32:34.257
He's young , not terribly bright.

1226
01:32:34.799 --> 01:32:38.219
It's not surprising he wouldn't
know what a state he put you in.

1227
01:32:38.636 --> 01:32:40.180
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1228
01:32:40.972 --> 01:32:45.143
Let's say for the moment
this Blatch does exist.

1229
01:32:45.393 --> 01:32:50.023
You think he'd just fall to his knees
and cry, "Yes, I did it. I confess.

1230
01:32:50.231 --> 01:32:52.942
By the way,
add a life term to my sentence."

1231
01:32:53.151 --> 01:32:55.945
With Tommy's testimony,
I can get a new trial.

1232
01:32:56.154 --> 01:32:58.615
That's assuming Blatch is still there.

1233
01:32:58.823 --> 01:33:00.784
Chances are, he'd be released by now.

1234
01:33:00.992 --> 01:33:05.580
They'd have his last known address,
names of relatives. It's a chance, isn't it?

1235
01:33:07.916 --> 01:33:09.667
How can you be so obtuse?

1236
01:33:10.585 --> 01:33:11.836
What?

1237
01:33:13.088 --> 01:33:14.547
What did you call me?

1238
01:33:14.756 --> 01:33:16.508
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1239
01:33:16.841 --> 01:33:18.343
You're forgetting yourself.

1240
01:33:18.676 --> 01:33:21.638
The country club
will have his old time cards.

1241
01:33:21.846 --> 01:33:24.599
Records, W-2s with his name on them.

1242
01:33:24.808 --> 01:33:27.519
If you want to indulge this fantasy,
it's your business.

1243
01:33:27.685 --> 01:33:30.313
Don't make it mine.
This meeting is over.

1244
01:33:30.522 --> 01:33:33.108
If I got out, I'd never mention
what happens here.

1245
01:33:33.733 --> 01:33:36.694
I'd be as indictable as you
for laundering that money.

1246
01:33:37.737 --> 01:33:41.533
Don't ever mention money to me again ,
you sorry son of a bitch!

1247
01:33:41.699 --> 01:33:43.368
Not in this office...

1248
01:33:43.576 --> 01:33:45.537
... not anywhere. Get in here, now!

1249
01:33:45.745 --> 01:33:48.456
I just wanted to put you at ease,
that's all.

1250
01:33:49.082 --> 01:33:51.209
-Solitary. A month .
-Yes, sir.

1251
01:33:51.376 --> 01:33:54.170
-What's the matter with you?
-Get him out of here.

1252
01:33:54.379 --> 01:33:57.924
This is my chance to get out!
It's my life! Don't you understand?!

1253
01:33:58.133 --> 01:34:00.218
Get him out!

1254
01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:03.930
A month in the hole.

1255
01:34:04.139 --> 01:34:06.850
That's the longest stretch
I ever heard of.

1256
01:34:07.058 --> 01:34:08.351
It's all my fault.

1257
01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:10.145
Bullshit.

1258
01:34:10.812 --> 01:34:13.523
You didn't pull the trigger
or convict him.

1259
01:34:13.731 --> 01:34:16.109
Are you saying Andy is innocent?

1260
01:34:16.317 --> 01:34:18.361
I mean , for real innocent?

1261
01:34:18.570 --> 01:34:19.904
It looks that way.

1262
01:34:20.321 --> 01:34:22.240
Sweet Jesus.

1263
01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:24.325
How long has he been here now?

1264
01:34:24.742 --> 01:34:27.996
1947. What is that? Nineteen years.

1265
01:34:28.246 --> 01:34:30.832
-Williams, Thomas.
-Yeah , over here.

1266
01:34:36.671 --> 01:34:37.839
What you got?

1267
01:34:38.464 --> 01:34:39.799
Board of Education.

1268
01:34:40.008 --> 01:34:41.551
That son of a bitch mailed it.

1269
01:34:41.759 --> 01:34:45.722
You going to open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

1270
01:34:45.930 --> 01:34:48.099
Thumb up my butt sounds better.

1271
01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:51.436
Skeets, come on .
Give me that, you shithead.

1272
01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:53.605
Floyd , come on.

1273
01:34:59.027 --> 01:35:01.446
Will you throw that away, please?

1274
01:35:07.035 --> 01:35:08.786
Well , shit.

1275
01:35:21.466 --> 01:35:24.260
The kid passed. C-plus average.

1276
01:35:24.469 --> 01:35:26.554
Thought you'd like to know.

1277
01:35:42.779 --> 01:35:44.239
Warden wants to talk.

1278
01:35:58.002 --> 01:35:59.045
Out here?

1279
01:35:59.254 --> 01:36:01.506
That's what the man said.

1280
01:36:17.605 --> 01:36:18.856
Warden?

1281
01:36:28.616 --> 01:36:32.704
I'm asking you to keep this conversation
just between us.

1282
01:36:34.205 --> 01:36:36.457
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1283
01:36:54.892 --> 01:36:56.978
We got a situation here.

1284
01:36:57.854 --> 01:36:59.939
I think you can appreciate that.

1285
01:37:00.148 --> 01:37:01.399
Yes, sir.

1286
01:37:01.649 --> 01:37:03.067
I sure can.

1287
01:37:03.318 --> 01:37:07.363
I tell you , son , this thing really
came along and knocked my wind out.

1288
01:37:08.823 --> 01:37:11.409
It's got me up nights. That's the truth.

1289
01:37:13.661 --> 01:37:15.496
The right thing to do...

1290
01:37:17.165 --> 01:37:20.918
...sometimes it's hard to know
what that is.

1291
01:37:21.919 --> 01:37:23.338
Do you understand?

1292
01:37:25.631 --> 01:37:27.258
I need your help, son.

1293
01:37:28.676 --> 01:37:30.845
If I'm going to move on this...

1294
01:37:31.179 --> 01:37:34.349
...there can't be
the least little shred of doubt.

1295
01:37:35.099 --> 01:37:36.142
I have to know...

1296
01:37:36.309 --> 01:37:38.978
... if what you told Dufresne
was the truth.

1297
01:37:39.187 --> 01:37:40.313
Yes, sir.

1298
01:37:40.521 --> 01:37:41.773
Absolutely.

1299
01:37:42.273 --> 01:37:45.276
Would you be willing to swear
before a judge and jury...

1300
01:37:45.443 --> 01:37:47.445
...with your hand on the Good Book...

1301
01:37:47.653 --> 01:37:50.323
...and take an oath
before Almighty God himself?

1302
01:37:50.531 --> 01:37:52.325
Just give me that chance.

1303
01:37:56.621 --> 01:37:57.955
That's what I thought.

1304
01:38:45.002 --> 01:38:46.921
I'm sure by now you've heard.

1305
01:38:48.673 --> 01:38:49.715
Terrible thing.

1306
01:38:51.342 --> 01:38:52.802
A man that young ...

1307
01:38:53.136 --> 01:38:55.721
... less than a year to go,
trying to escape.

1308
01:38:56.264 --> 01:38:58.766
Broke Captain Hadley's heart
to shoot him.

1309
01:38:59.517 --> 01:39:01.018
Truly, it did.

1310
01:39:04.021 --> 01:39:06.441
We just have to put it behind us.

1311
01:39:08.109 --> 01:39:09.360
Move on.

1312
01:39:10.945 --> 01:39:12.447
I'm done.

1313
01:39:13.739 --> 01:39:15.366
Everything stops.

1314
01:39:17.368 --> 01:39:19.704
Get someone else to run your scams.

1315
01:39:20.955 --> 01:39:22.790
Nothing stops.

1316
01:39:24.125 --> 01:39:25.501
Nothing.

1317
01:39:28.713 --> 01:39:31.799
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

1318
01:39:32.216 --> 01:39:34.552
No more protection from the guards.

1319
01:39:34.719 --> 01:39:39.640
I'll pull you out of that 1 -bunk Hilton
and cast you down with the sodomites.

1320
01:39:41.058 --> 01:39:43.478
You'll think you've been
fucked by a train.

1321
01:39:44.896 --> 01:39:46.397
And the library?

1322
01:39:47.064 --> 01:39:48.065
Gone.

1323
01:39:48.649 --> 01:39:51.235
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1324
01:39:51.694 --> 01:39:54.363
We'll have us a little
book barbecue in the yard.

1325
01:39:54.572 --> 01:39:56.699
They'll see the flames for miles.

1326
01:39:56.908 --> 01:39:59.744
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

1327
01:40:00.995 --> 01:40:03.998
You understand me? Catching my drift?

1328
01:40:07.752 --> 01:40:09.587
Or am I being obtuse?

1329
01:40:21.390 --> 01:40:24.018
Give him another month
to think about it.

1330
01:41:10.773 --> 01:41:13.818
My wife used to say
I'm a hard man to know.

1331
01:41:14.652 --> 01:41:16.487
Like a closed book.

1332
01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:19.323
Complained about it all the time.

1333
01:41:20.241 --> 01:41:21.826
She was beautiful.

1334
01:41:24.203 --> 01:41:26.038
God , I loved her.

1335
01:41:29.458 --> 01:41:31.669
I didn't know how to show it, that's all.

1336
01:41:34.422 --> 01:41:36.090
I killed her, Red.

1337
01:41:37.967 --> 01:41:39.760
I didn't pull the trigger...

1338
01:41:41.178 --> 01:41:42.930
... but I drove her away.

1339
01:41:44.432 --> 01:41:47.143
That's why she died , because of me...

1340
01:41:47.310 --> 01:41:48.686
...the way I am.

1341
01:41:57.695 --> 01:41:59.530
That don't make you a murderer.

1342
01:42:02.908 --> 01:42:04.702
Bad husband , maybe.

1343
01:42:08.331 --> 01:42:11.584
Feel bad about it if you want,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

1344
01:42:11.792 --> 01:42:13.127
No, I didn't.

1345
01:42:13.544 --> 01:42:15.463
Somebody else did.

1346
01:42:16.714 --> 01:42:18.799
And I wound up in here.

1347
01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:22.887
Bad luck, I guess.

1348
01:42:28.059 --> 01:42:29.518
It floats around.

1349
01:42:30.561 --> 01:42:32.772
It's got to land on somebody.

1350
01:42:33.689 --> 01:42:35.566
It was my turn , that's all.

1351
01:42:36.275 --> 01:42:39.070
I was in the path of the tornado.

1352
01:42:44.992 --> 01:42:48.954
I just didn't expect the storm
would last as long as it has.

1353
01:42:53.292 --> 01:42:55.002
Think you'll ever get out of here?

1354
01:42:56.253 --> 01:42:57.672
Me?

1355
01:43:00.257 --> 01:43:01.592
Yeah.

1356
01:43:02.593 --> 01:43:04.887
One day, when I got
a long , white beard ...

1357
01:43:05.096 --> 01:43:09.183
...and two or three marbles rolling
around upstairs, they'll let me out.

1358
01:43:10.267 --> 01:43:11.936
I tell you where I'd go.

1359
01:43:13.396 --> 01:43:15.106
Zihuatanejo.

1360
01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:17.108
Say what?

1361
01:43:17.441 --> 01:43:19.276
Zihuatanejo.

1362
01:43:20.194 --> 01:43:21.862
It's in Mexico.

1363
01:43:23.239 --> 01:43:25.366
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1364
01:43:26.492 --> 01:43:29.286
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

1365
01:43:31.122 --> 01:43:33.124
They say it has no memory.

1366
01:43:35.084 --> 01:43:37.753
That's where I want to live
the rest of my life.

1367
01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:41.882
A warm place with no memory.

1368
01:43:45.136 --> 01:43:47.054
Open up a little hotel ...

1369
01:43:48.764 --> 01:43:50.266
... right on the beach.

1370
01:43:50.850 --> 01:43:53.060
Buy some worthless old boat...

1371
01:43:53.602 --> 01:43:55.229
...and fix it up new.

1372
01:43:57.982 --> 01:43:59.191
Take my guests out...

1373
01:44:00.025 --> 01:44:01.402
...charter fishing.

1374
01:44:05.239 --> 01:44:06.991
Zihuatanejo.

1375
01:44:10.494 --> 01:44:14.373
In a place like that, I could use
a man that knows how to get things.

1376
01:44:20.921 --> 01:44:23.758
I don't think I could make it
on the outside.

1377
01:44:30.431 --> 01:44:32.516
I been in here most of my life.

1378
01:44:33.934 --> 01:44:35.686
I'm an institutional man now.

1379
01:44:36.604 --> 01:44:38.355
Just like Brooks was.

1380
01:44:39.815 --> 01:44:41.525
You underestimate yourself.

1381
01:44:42.067 --> 01:44:43.694
I don't think so.

1382
01:44:47.531 --> 01:44:51.452
In here I'm the guy who can get things
for you , sure, but...

1383
01:44:52.203 --> 01:44:54.747
...outside all you need
is the Yellow Pages.

1384
01:44:54.955 --> 01:44:57.208
Hell , I wouldn't know
where to begin.

1385
01:44:59.335 --> 01:45:00.961
Pacific Ocean?

1386
01:45:01.378 --> 01:45:02.588
Shit.

1387
01:45:02.963 --> 01:45:05.174
Scare me to death , something that big.

1388
01:45:05.382 --> 01:45:06.675
Not me.

1389
01:45:07.885 --> 01:45:10.638
I didn't shoot my wife,
and I didn't shoot her lover.

1390
01:45:12.389 --> 01:45:15.601
Whatever mistakes I made,
I've paid for them and then some.

1391
01:45:16.644 --> 01:45:18.145
That hotel , that boat...

1392
01:45:19.897 --> 01:45:22.149
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1393
01:45:27.071 --> 01:45:29.490
You shouldn't be doing this to yourself.

1394
01:45:29.698 --> 01:45:31.742
This is just shitty pipe dreams.

1395
01:45:32.159 --> 01:45:34.620
Mexico is way down there
and you're in here...

1396
01:45:34.829 --> 01:45:36.413
...and that's the way it is.

1397
01:45:36.747 --> 01:45:39.583
Yeah , right. That's the way it is.

1398
01:45:41.085 --> 01:45:43.462
It's down there and I'm in here.

1399
01:45:46.048 --> 01:45:48.759
I guess it comes down
to a simple choice.

1400
01:45:51.679 --> 01:45:53.180
Get busy living ...

1401
01:45:54.557 --> 01:45:56.600
...or get busy dying.

1402
01:46:08.696 --> 01:46:11.448
If you ever get out of here,
do me a favor.

1403
01:46:11.615 --> 01:46:13.909
Sure, Andy. Anything.

1404
01:46:15.786 --> 01:46:19.623
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton .
You know where Buxton is?

1405
01:46:21.125 --> 01:46:24.253
-A lot of hayfields up there.
-One in particular.

1406
01:46:24.461 --> 01:46:28.382
It's got a long rock wall
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1407
01:46:28.591 --> 01:46:31.468
It's like something
out of a Robert Frost poem.

1408
01:46:32.386 --> 01:46:34.889
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1409
01:46:36.307 --> 01:46:38.392
We went there for a picnic...

1410
01:46:38.809 --> 01:46:40.895
...and made love under that oak...

1411
01:46:41.562 --> 01:46:43.814
...and I asked and she said yes.

1412
01:46:47.818 --> 01:46:49.653
Promise me, Red.

1413
01:46:50.487 --> 01:46:52.114
If you ever get out...

1414
01:46:52.323 --> 01:46:53.824
...find that spot.

1415
01:46:54.992 --> 01:46:59.830
At the base of that wall , there's a rock
that has no earthly business in Maine.

1416
01:47:00.956 --> 01:47:04.001
Piece of black, volcanic glass.

1417
01:47:06.670 --> 01:47:09.340
Something's buried under it
I want you to have.

1418
01:47:10.090 --> 01:47:11.342
What, Andy?

1419
01:47:11.759 --> 01:47:13.510
What's buried under there?

1420
01:47:15.095 --> 01:47:16.972
You'll have to pry it up...

1421
01:47:17.181 --> 01:47:18.432
...to see.

1422
01:47:24.438 --> 01:47:26.273
No, I'm telling you. The guy is...

1423
01:47:26.941 --> 01:47:28.692
He's talking funny.

1424
01:47:29.777 --> 01:47:31.487
I'm really worried about him.

1425
01:47:31.862 --> 01:47:33.322
Let's keep an eye on him.

1426
01:47:33.530 --> 01:47:36.784
That's fine during the day,
but at night he's all alone.

1427
01:47:38.202 --> 01:47:39.370
Oh , Lord.

1428
01:47:40.704 --> 01:47:42.289
What?

1429
01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:45.793
Andy come down
to the loading dock today.

1430
01:47:46.001 --> 01:47:48.087
He asked me for a length of rope.

1431
01:47:48.295 --> 01:47:51.006
-Rope?
-Six feet long.

1432
01:47:51.215 --> 01:47:52.591
And you gave it to him.

1433
01:47:53.467 --> 01:47:55.260
Sure. Why wouldn't I?

1434
01:47:55.469 --> 01:47:57.054
Jesus! Heywood.

1435
01:47:57.638 --> 01:47:59.598
How was I supposed to know?

1436
01:47:59.807 --> 01:48:01.392
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1437
01:48:03.394 --> 01:48:05.312
Andy would never do that.

1438
01:48:05.896 --> 01:48:07.356
Never.

1439
01:48:09.066 --> 01:48:10.401
I don't know.

1440
01:48:13.237 --> 01:48:15.239
Every man has his breaking point.

1441
01:48:17.574 --> 01:48:19.868
Lickety-split. Want to get home.

1442
01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:21.912
Just about finished , sir.

1443
01:48:39.054 --> 01:48:40.681
Three deposits tonight.

1444
01:48:48.647 --> 01:48:50.566
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1445
01:48:50.774 --> 01:48:52.401
And shine my shoes.

1446
01:48:52.609 --> 01:48:55.529
-I want them looking like mirrors.
-Yes, sir.

1447
01:49:01.035 --> 01:49:02.494
It's good having you back.

1448
01:49:03.454 --> 01:49:05.289
Place wasn't the same without you.

1449
01:49:52.169 --> 01:49:53.545
Lights out!

1450
01:50:26.078 --> 01:50:28.622
<i>I've had some long nights in the stir.</i>

1451
01:50:29.164 --> 01:50:31.834
<i>Alone in the dark
with nothing but your thoughts...</i>

1452
01:50:32.042 --> 01:50:34.711
<i>...time can draw out like a blade.</i>

1453
01:50:40.050 --> 01:50:43.053
<i>That was the longest night of my life.</i>

1454
01:50:58.902 --> 01:51:00.070
Give me a count!

1455
01:51:04.575 --> 01:51:07.411
Tier 3 south , clear!

1456
01:51:10.539 --> 01:51:13.709
Man missing on tier 2, cell 245!

1457
01:51:13.917 --> 01:51:14.960
Dufresne!

1458
01:51:15.502 --> 01:51:17.921
Come out. You're holding up the show!

1459
01:51:21.091 --> 01:51:24.469
Don't make me come down
or I'll thump your skull for you!

1460
01:51:32.060 --> 01:51:35.898
Damn it, you're putting me behind !
I got a schedule to keep.

1461
01:51:36.106 --> 01:51:39.401
You'd better be sick or dead in there.
I shit you not!

1462
01:51:39.610 --> 01:51:40.944
You hear me?

1463
01:51:47.034 --> 01:51:49.119
Oh , my Holy God.

1464
01:52:06.136 --> 01:52:08.680
I want every man
on this cell block questioned.

1465
01:52:09.139 --> 01:52:11.683
-Start with that friend of his.
-Who?

1466
01:52:11.850 --> 01:52:13.268
Him.

1467
01:52:14.269 --> 01:52:15.812
Open 237.

1468
01:52:19.316 --> 01:52:22.986
What do you mean , "He just wasn't here"?
Don't say that to me.

1469
01:52:23.862 --> 01:52:26.448
-Don't say that to me again .
-But, sir, he wasn't.

1470
01:52:26.657 --> 01:52:30.160
I can see that, Haig ! Think I'm blind?

1471
01:52:30.827 --> 01:52:32.412
Is that what you're saying?

1472
01:52:32.579 --> 01:52:35.082
-Am I blind , Haig?
-No, sir!

1473
01:52:35.999 --> 01:52:38.502
What about you. You blind?

1474
01:52:39.002 --> 01:52:41.546
-Tell me what this is.
-Last night's count.

1475
01:52:41.755 --> 01:52:45.050
You see Dufresne's name there?
I sure do. Right there.

1476
01:52:45.259 --> 01:52:46.593
"Dufresne."

1477
01:52:48.262 --> 01:52:51.014
He was in his cell at lights out.

1478
01:52:51.181 --> 01:52:54.101
Stands to reason he'd still be here
in the morning.

1479
01:52:54.434 --> 01:52:56.061
I want him found.

1480
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:59.731
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!

1481
01:52:59.982 --> 01:53:01.191
Yes, sir.

1482
01:53:02.192 --> 01:53:05.988
Let's go. Move your butts. Move it!

1483
01:53:07.864 --> 01:53:08.865
Stand.

1484
01:53:10.284 --> 01:53:11.702
Well?

1485
01:53:14.788 --> 01:53:15.831
Well , what?

1486
01:53:15.998 --> 01:53:19.459
I see you two all the time.
You're thick as thieves, you are.

1487
01:53:20.544 --> 01:53:22.045
He must have said something.

1488
01:53:22.754 --> 01:53:25.674
No, sir, warden. Not a word.

1489
01:53:27.467 --> 01:53:30.053
Lord , it's a miracle!

1490
01:53:30.637 --> 01:53:33.223
Man vanished like a fart in the wind.

1491
01:53:33.890 --> 01:53:35.058
Nothing left...

1492
01:53:35.892 --> 01:53:38.603
... but some damn rocks
on a windowsill.

1493
01:53:38.812 --> 01:53:41.565
And that cupcake on the wall .
Let's ask her.

1494
01:53:41.732 --> 01:53:43.525
Maybe she knows.

1495
01:53:43.734 --> 01:53:46.486
What say there, fuzzy-britches?
Feel like talking?

1496
01:53:47.904 --> 01:53:49.239
Guess not.

1497
01:53:49.781 --> 01:53:51.992
Why should she be any different?

1498
01:53:53.076 --> 01:53:54.745
This is a conspiracy.

1499
01:53:55.370 --> 01:53:57.080
That's what this is.

1500
01:53:57.789 --> 01:54:01.543
One big , damn conspiracy!

1501
01:54:01.793 --> 01:54:03.795
And everyone's in on it!

1502
01:54:04.421 --> 01:54:05.589
Including her!

1503
01:54:40.624 --> 01:54:42.334
<i>In 1900...</i>

1504
01:54:42.542 --> 01:54:44.961
<i>...Andy Dufresne escaped...</i>

1505
01:54:45.128 --> 01:54:46.713
<i>...from Shawshank Prison.</i>

1506
01:54:48.965 --> 01:54:51.510
<i>All they found
was a muddy set of prison clothes...</i>

1507
01:54:52.135 --> 01:54:53.678
<i>...a bar of soap...</i>

1508
01:54:53.887 --> 01:54:55.472
<i>...and an old rock hammer...</i>

1509
01:54:55.639 --> 01:54:58.141
<i>...damn near worn down to the nub.</i>

1510
01:55:02.646 --> 01:55:07.401
<i>I remember thinking it would take a man
000 years to tunnel through the wall with it.</i>

1511
01:55:08.026 --> 01:55:10.654
<i>Old Andy did it in less than 20.</i>

1512
01:55:28.964 --> 01:55:31.258
<i>Oh, Andy loved geology.</i>

1513
01:55:32.008 --> 01:55:35.178
<i>I imagine it appealed to
his meticulous nature.</i>

1514
01:55:35.595 --> 01:55:37.431
<i>An ice age here...</i>

1515
01:55:37.848 --> 01:55:40.350
<i>...million years
of mountain-building there.</i>

1516
01:55:41.351 --> 01:55:44.187
<i>Geology is the study
of pressure and time.</i>

1517
01:55:45.021 --> 01:55:47.023
<i>That's all it takes, really.</i>

1518
01:55:47.774 --> 01:55:49.067
<i>Pressure...</i>

1519
01:55:49.526 --> 01:55:51.027
<i>...and time.</i>

1520
01:55:52.112 --> 01:55:54.197
<i>That and a big goddamn poster.</i>

1521
01:55:57.993 --> 01:55:59.161
<i>Like I said...</i>

1522
01:55:59.661 --> 01:56:03.665
<i>...in prison, a man will do anything
to keep his mind occupied.</i>

1523
01:56:06.460 --> 01:56:11.256
<i>Seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting
his wall out into the exercise yard...</i>

1524
01:56:11.798 --> 01:56:13.717
<i>...a handful at a time.</i>

1525
01:56:15.051 --> 01:56:17.095
<i>I guess after Tommy was killed...</i>

1526
01:56:17.304 --> 01:56:20.265
<i>...Andy decided
he'd been here long enough.</i>

1527
01:56:20.474 --> 01:56:23.059
Lickety-split. I want to get home.

1528
01:56:23.768 --> 01:56:25.812
I'm just about finished , sir.

1529
01:56:47.250 --> 01:56:49.211
Three deposits tonight.

1530
01:56:56.510 --> 01:56:58.803
<i>Andy did like he was told.</i>

1531
01:56:59.012 --> 01:57:02.516
<i>Buffed those shoes
to a high mirror-shine.</i>

1532
01:57:06.186 --> 01:57:08.480
<i>The guards simply didn't notice.</i>

1533
01:57:08.772 --> 01:57:10.273
<i>Neither did I.</i>

1534
01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:11.983
<i>I mean, seriously...</i>

1535
01:57:12.192 --> 01:57:15.195
<i>...how often do you really look
at a man's shoes?</i>

1536
01:59:18.735 --> 01:59:21.905
<i>Andy crawled to freedom
through 500 yards...</i>

1537
01:59:22.155 --> 01:59:25.492
<i>...of shit-smelling foulness
I can't even imagine.</i>

1538
01:59:26.493 --> 01:59:28.828
<i>Or maybe I just don't want to.</i>

1539
01:59:33.249 --> 01:59:35.585
<i>Five hundred yards.</i>

1540
01:59:36.086 --> 01:59:39.172
<i>That's the length
of five football fields.</i>

1541
01:59:39.798 --> 01:59:42.384
<i>Just shy of half a mile.</i>

1542
02:00:37.605 --> 02:00:42.193
<i>The next morning, right about the time
Raquel was spilling her secret...</i>

1543
02:00:42.485 --> 02:00:45.321
<i>...a man nobody ever
laid eyes on before...</i>

1544
02:00:45.572 --> 02:00:48.158
<i>...strolled into
the Maine National Bank.</i>

1545
02:00:48.742 --> 02:00:51.911
<i>Until that moment, he didn't exist.</i>

1546
02:00:52.495 --> 02:00:54.831
<i>-Except on paper.</i>
-May I help you?

1547
02:00:55.248 --> 02:00:57.167
<i>He had all the proper ID--</i>

1548
02:00:57.375 --> 02:01:01.087
<i>Driver's license, birth certificate,
Social Security card.</i>

1549
02:01:01.504 --> 02:01:04.048
<i>--And the signature
was a spot-on match.</i>

1550
02:01:04.257 --> 02:01:07.343
I must say I'm sorry
to be losing your business.

1551
02:01:07.552 --> 02:01:09.304
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

1552
02:01:10.096 --> 02:01:11.681
Thank you.

1553
02:01:11.848 --> 02:01:13.016
I'm sure I will.

1554
02:01:13.933 --> 02:01:17.270
Here's your cashier's check, sir.
Will there be anything else?

1555
02:01:17.479 --> 02:01:18.480
Please.

1556
02:01:19.022 --> 02:01:21.524
Would you add this
to your outgoing mail?

1557
02:01:22.025 --> 02:01:23.568
I'd be happy to.

1558
02:01:25.028 --> 02:01:26.362
Good day, sir.

1559
02:01:27.322 --> 02:01:31.743
<i>Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks
in the Portland area that morning.</i>

1560
02:01:32.202 --> 02:01:33.828
<i>All told, he blew town...</i>

1561
02:01:34.037 --> 02:01:38.875
<i>...with better than $370, 000
of Warden Norton's money.</i>

1562
02:01:39.542 --> 02:01:42.337
<i>Severance pay for 19 years.</i>

1563
02:01:49.552 --> 02:01:51.763
Good morning , <i>Portland Daily Bugle.</i>

1564
02:02:44.607 --> 02:02:47.569
Byron Hadley?
You have the right to remain silent.

1565
02:02:47.819 --> 02:02:52.282
If you give up this right, anything you
say can be held against you in court.

1566
02:02:52.699 --> 02:02:57.161
<i>I wasn't there to see it, but I hear
Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl...</i>

1567
02:02:57.370 --> 02:02:58.872
<i>...when they took him away.</i>

1568
02:03:04.752 --> 02:03:08.131
<i>Norton had no intention
of going that quietly.</i>

1569
02:03:24.105 --> 02:03:25.481
Samuel Norton.

1570
02:03:25.648 --> 02:03:28.067
We have a warrant for your arrest.
Open up.

1571
02:03:32.822 --> 02:03:34.282
Open the door.

1572
02:03:34.449 --> 02:03:35.700
I'm not sure which key.

1573
02:03:45.835 --> 02:03:47.795
Make it easy on yourself, Norton!

1574
02:03:59.307 --> 02:04:02.769
<i>I like to think the last thing
that went through his head...</i>

1575
02:04:02.977 --> 02:04:04.562
<i>...other than that bullet...</i>

1576
02:04:04.771 --> 02:04:09.192
<i>...was to wonder how the hell
Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.</i>

1577
02:04:11.694 --> 02:04:15.198
<i>Not long after the warden
deprived us of his company...</i>

1578
02:04:15.448 --> 02:04:17.533
<i>...I got a postcard in the mail.</i>

1579
02:04:18.993 --> 02:04:21.829
<i>It was blank, but the postmark said...</i>

1580
02:04:22.038 --> 02:04:24.165
<i>...Fort Hancock, Texas.</i>

1581
02:04:24.707 --> 02:04:26.042
<i>Fort Hancock...</i>

1582
02:04:26.334 --> 02:04:28.044
<i>...right on the border.</i>

1583
02:04:28.461 --> 02:04:30.463
<i>That's where Andy crossed.</i>

1584
02:04:31.047 --> 02:04:35.176
<i>When I picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down...</i>

1585
02:04:35.510 --> 02:04:37.720
<i>...it always makes me laugh.</i>

1586
02:04:39.555 --> 02:04:41.140
<i>Andy Dufresne...</i>

1587
02:04:41.516 --> 02:04:43.559
<i>...who crawled through
a river of shit...</i>

1588
02:04:43.726 --> 02:04:46.145
<i>...and came out clean
on the other side.</i>

1589
02:04:46.980 --> 02:04:48.356
<i>Andy Dufresne...</i>

1590
02:04:49.148 --> 02:04:50.733
<i>...headed for the Pacific.</i>

1591
02:04:53.736 --> 02:04:55.905
Hadley's got him
by the throat, right?

1592
02:04:56.072 --> 02:04:59.909
He says, "I believe this boy's
about to have himself an accident."

1593
02:05:00.076 --> 02:05:02.954
<i>Those of us who knew him best
talk about him often.</i>

1594
02:05:03.621 --> 02:05:05.331
<i>I swear, the stuff he pulled. ...</i>

1595
02:05:05.540 --> 02:05:08.501
"My friends could use
a couple of beers."

1596
02:05:08.835 --> 02:05:10.503
And he got it!

1597
02:05:11.754 --> 02:05:14.132
<i>Sometimes it makes me sad, though...</i>

1598
02:05:14.424 --> 02:05:15.842
<i>...Andy being gone.</i>

1599
02:05:16.551 --> 02:05:20.680
<i>I have to remind myself that
some birds aren't meant to be caged.</i>

1600
02:05:21.139 --> 02:05:23.224
<i>Their feathers are just too bright.</i>

1601
02:05:24.934 --> 02:05:26.644
<i>And when they fly away...</i>

1602
02:05:27.103 --> 02:05:31.482
<i>...the part of you that knows it was
a sin to lock them up does rejoice.</i>

1603
02:05:32.567 --> 02:05:33.818
<i>But still...</i>

1604
02:05:34.277 --> 02:05:38.614
<i>...the place you live in is that much
more drab and empty that they're gone.</i>

1605
02:05:42.827 --> 02:05:45.204
<i>I guess I just miss my friend.</i>

1606
02:06:09.645 --> 02:06:10.813
Please sit down.

1607
02:06:16.652 --> 02:06:18.237
Ellis Boyd Redding ...

1608
02:06:18.780 --> 02:06:22.033
...your files say you've served
40 years of a life sentence.

1609
02:06:22.825 --> 02:06:24.994
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

1610
02:06:26.829 --> 02:06:28.414
Rehabilitated?

1611
02:06:30.458 --> 02:06:32.335
Well , now, let me see.

1612
02:06:33.336 --> 02:06:35.671
I don't have any idea what that means.

1613
02:06:37.799 --> 02:06:40.051
It means you're ready
to rejoin society--

1614
02:06:40.635 --> 02:06:42.970
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1615
02:06:45.139 --> 02:06:47.141
To me it's just a made-up word.

1616
02:06:48.476 --> 02:06:50.812
A politician's word so that...

1617
02:06:51.229 --> 02:06:54.774
...young fellas like yourself
can wear a suit and a tie...

1618
02:06:55.233 --> 02:06:56.859
...and have a job.

1619
02:06:58.820 --> 02:07:00.905
What do you really want to know?

1620
02:07:01.697 --> 02:07:03.658
Am I sorry for what I did?

1621
02:07:04.075 --> 02:07:05.368
Well , are you?

1622
02:07:07.161 --> 02:07:09.997
There's not a day goes by
I don't feel regret.

1623
02:07:11.374 --> 02:07:14.836
Not because I'm in here
or because you think I should.

1624
02:07:18.297 --> 02:07:20.883
I look back on the way I was then ...

1625
02:07:23.010 --> 02:07:24.345
...a young ...

1626
02:07:25.263 --> 02:07:28.766
...stupid kid who committed
that terrible crime.

1627
02:07:31.769 --> 02:07:33.479
I want to talk to him.

1628
02:07:35.398 --> 02:07:37.900
I want to try
and talk some sense to him.

1629
02:07:38.609 --> 02:07:40.570
Tell him the way things are.

1630
02:07:42.655 --> 02:07:44.073
But I can't.

1631
02:07:46.284 --> 02:07:48.286
That kid's long gone...

1632
02:07:49.495 --> 02:07:52.248
...and this old man is all that's left.

1633
02:07:53.666 --> 02:07:55.126
I got to live with that.

1634
02:07:56.502 --> 02:07:58.212
Rehabilitated?

1635
02:07:58.588 --> 02:08:00.423
It's just a bullshit word.

1636
02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:06.095
So you go on and stamp your forms,
sonny, and stop wasting my time.

1637
02:08:07.346 --> 02:08:09.599
Because to tell you the truth ...

1638
02:08:09.932 --> 02:08:11.934
... I don't give a shit.

1639
02:09:38.479 --> 02:09:39.855
Here you go, miss.

1640
02:09:42.817 --> 02:09:43.859
Restroom break?

1641
02:09:49.657 --> 02:09:54.203
You don't need to ask me every time you
need to go take a piss. Just go.

1642
02:09:55.204 --> 02:09:56.831
Yes, sir.

1643
02:10:07.216 --> 02:10:10.303
<i>Forty years I've been asking
permission to piss.</i>

1644
02:10:11.137 --> 02:10:14.140
<i>I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.</i>

1645
02:10:17.643 --> 02:10:19.812
<i>There's a harsh truth to face.</i>

1646
02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:24.400
<i>No way I'm going to make it
on the outside.</i>

1647
02:10:32.241 --> 02:10:35.953
<i>All I do anymore is think of ways
to break my parole...</i>

1648
02:10:36.746 --> 02:10:39.248
<i>...so maybe they'd send me back.</i>

1649
02:10:44.420 --> 02:10:46.881
<i>Terrible thing, to live in fear.</i>

1650
02:10:47.757 --> 02:10:49.425
<i>Brooks Hatlen knew it.</i>

1651
02:10:49.633 --> 02:10:51.594
<i>Knew it all too well.</i>

1652
02:10:53.179 --> 02:10:56.599
<i>All I want is to be back
where things make sense.</i>

1653
02:10:57.016 --> 02:10:59.769
<i>Where I won't have to be afraid
all the time.</i>

1654
02:11:01.771 --> 02:11:04.106
<i>Only one thing stops me.</i>

1655
02:11:05.566 --> 02:11:07.943
<i>A promise I made to Andy.</i>

1656
02:11:28.464 --> 02:11:29.799
There it is.

1657
02:11:40.226 --> 02:11:41.894
Much obliged , sir.

1658
02:15:21.196 --> 02:15:22.489
<i>Dear Red:</i>

1659
02:15:22.698 --> 02:15:25.200
<i>if you're reading this,
you've gotten out...</i>

1660
02:15:25.367 --> 02:15:29.538
<i>...and if you've come this far,
maybe you're willing to come a bit further.</i>

1661
02:15:29.705 --> 02:15:32.207
<i>You remember the name
of the town, don't you?</i>

1662
02:15:34.501 --> 02:15:36.003
Zihuatanejo.

1663
02:15:37.630 --> 02:15:41.216
<i>I could use a good man
to help me get my project on wheels.</i>

1664
02:15:41.717 --> 02:15:45.262
<i>I'll keep an eye out for you,
and the chessboard ready.</i>

1665
02:15:46.055 --> 02:15:47.473
<i>Remember, Red...</i>

1666
02:15:47.806 --> 02:15:49.892
<i>...hope is a good thing...</i>

1667
02:15:50.100 --> 02:15:52.102
<i>...maybe the best of things.</i>

1668
02:15:52.311 --> 02:15:54.480
<i>And no good thing ever dies.</i>

1669
02:15:55.022 --> 02:15:57.900
<i>I will be hoping
that this letter finds you...</i>

1670
02:15:58.067 --> 02:15:59.818
<i>...and finds you well.</i>

1671
02:16:00.319 --> 02:16:01.570
<i>Your friend...</i>

1672
02:16:01.737 --> 02:16:02.905
<i>...Andy.</i>

1673
02:16:36.772 --> 02:16:38.482
<i>"Get busy living...</i>

1674
02:16:38.691 --> 02:16:40.609
<i>...or get busy dying."</i>

1675
02:16:43.278 --> 02:16:45.447
<i>That's goddamn right.</i>

1676
02:16:50.703 --> 02:16:52.830
<i>For the second time in my life...</i>

1677
02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:55.624
<i>...I'm guilty of committing a crime.</i>

1678
02:16:56.709 --> 02:16:58.627
<i>Parole violation.</i>

1679
02:16:59.294 --> 02:17:02.965
<i>Of course, I doubt they'll toss up
any roadblocks for that.</i>

1680
02:17:03.632 --> 02:17:05.676
<i>Not for an old crook like me.</i>

1681
02:17:05.884 --> 02:17:07.928
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1682
02:17:11.598 --> 02:17:16.311
<i>I find I'm so excited I can barely
sit still or hold a thought in my head.</i>

1683
02:17:16.770 --> 02:17:20.107
<i>I think it's the excitement
only a free man can feel.</i>

1684
02:17:20.315 --> 02:17:22.818
<i>A free man at the start
of a long journey...</i>

1685
02:17:22.985 --> 02:17:25.612
<i>...whose conclusion is uncertain.</i>

1686
02:17:28.615 --> 02:17:31.285
<i>I hope I can make it across the border.</i>

1687
02:17:32.786 --> 02:17:35.831
<i>I hope to see my friend
and shake his hand.</i>

1688
02:17:37.666 --> 02:17:41.754
<i>I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.</i>

1689
02:17:43.589 --> 02:17:44.798
<i>I hope.</i>
