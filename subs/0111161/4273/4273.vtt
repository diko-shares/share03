1
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,610
- Good morning.
- Morning.

2
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,330
Ah.

3
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,640
You're amazing.

4
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,240
I know.

5
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,040
Mami, we already have crosses everywhere.

6
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,990
Do we really need a pope on the fridge?

7
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,250
Oh, yes, because he is so inspiring.

8
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,090
You walk in to get a yogurt,
you see him...

9
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,050
Hola, papa.

10
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,840
Puts a smile on your face.

11
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,720
Well, why don't you put the pope
in your room and go smile in there?

12
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,470
I already have
two popes in my room.

13
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,180
Gracias very much.

14
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,480
Oh.

15
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,120
Oh, what's that, papa?

16
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,600
Are you lonely?

17
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,120
You wanna be with your friends?

18
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,110
Well...

19
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,680
He looks happy there.

20
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,590
You can probably dump
that whole thing on there.

21
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,600
Next time.

22
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,230
Hi!

23
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,560
Welcome home, lupita.

24
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,360
We are almost done,
but there is plenty left.

25
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,070
Aw.

26
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,970
Dinner with my entire family...
And Schneider.

27
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,350
Yes, I invited him again. He's an orphan.

28
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,580
Do orphans always have rich dads
who buy them buildings?

29
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,420
Hey, I may have money in the bank
and two living parents,

30
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,900
and four living stepmothers...

31
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,610
But there is a hole in here.

32
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,220
We never had family meals.
I ate alone in front of the TV.

33
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,550
Ay, pobrecito Schneider.

34
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,830
Oh, don't get me wrong.
It was a massive TV.

35
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,560
Sometimes my nanny would join me,
but only if I agreed to watch telenovelas.

36
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,150
Ooh, those are so over the top.

37
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,110
Right? This one time,
Rosa got jealous of the housekeeper

38
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,030
'cause she was makin' a move on her man,

39
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:36,240
so she threatened to throw
live scorpions on her while she slept.

40
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,680
Sounds good. Which one was that?

41
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,180
Oh, no. Rosa was my nanny.

42
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,620
Ex-nanny. Now, stepmother.

43
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,860
I am so glad to be here.

44
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,110
I'm just glad to be home with everybody.

45
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,440
Who the hell are you?

46
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,680
This is Carmen, my best friend.

47
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,830
I'm doing my history project with her.

48
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,830
These all sound like things
I should know.

49
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Hi, Carmen.

50
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,960
Hi.

51
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,030
Ah.

52
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,840
I'm Penelope.

53
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,300
Kind of a big deal around here.

54
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,710
So, uh, what's this history project
you're working on?

55
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,730
And then maybe later you can show me
how to turn into a bat.

56
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,590
Well, we just got done
explaining the whole thing.

57
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,260
Oh, come on, mija, I missed it.

58
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,680
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait.

59
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,930
Alex, tell your mother that funny story
that happened in chemistry class.

60
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,870
- Again?
- I know, okay, I'll tell it.

61
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:49,770
So, there is the floor and... slip.

62
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,670
Oh, that Dylan.

63
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,150
Oh, that story never gets old.

64
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,700
Oh, man.

65
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,590
I've been workin' so much,
I'm missing all the scoops...

66
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,890
Plus latina twilight over here.

67
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,810
Careful.
There's a lot of garlic in that chicken.

68
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,900
Your mom's kind of mean.
I'm obsessed with her.

69
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,560
Who would like a pastelito?

70
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,180
Mmm! You know what?

71
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,940
How about we go on a family hike
this Saturday like we used to?

72
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,980
Mom, uh, Carmen and I need all Saturday
for our history thing.

73
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,840
Yeah, and abuelita and I have tickets
to wrestling.

74
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,320
I don't understand
why you waste good money on that.

75
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,470
It's educational.

76
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,630
Eh, I don't know.

77
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,410
Okay, Saturday's out.

78
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,970
How about we go on a hike
Sunday morning before it gets hot?

79
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,540
You seem to have forgot.
Sunday morning is for church.

80
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,210
So, we skip church.

81
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,570
You seem to have forgot.
We don't skip church.

82
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,920
Mami, it's okay if we miss it one time.
It's not gonna kill us.

83
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,940
Oh, really?

84
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,930
My great uncle luisito skipped church,

85
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,620
and on the same day,
he was crushed by a runaway tractor.

86
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,440
Why don't you just go to church
and then go hikin' after?

87
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,770
We're latinos, church takes all day.

88
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,440
By the time you're done with mass

89
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,360
and you've said hello to fulano y fulana,

90
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,490
- it's five o'clock!
- Oh, you exaggerate. 4:30.

91
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,080
I wanna see these guys this weekend.
Come on.

92
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,290
'Cause I like them.

93
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,410
Oh, no,

94
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,000
I have to put my foot down.

95
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,960
Sundays we go to church...

96
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,360
And then, sometimes we go to applebee's.

97
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,630
Well, I have a foot, too,

98
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:43,050
and I'm gonna put my foot down and say
this Sunday we're not going to church.

99
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,760
Well, I am putting both of my feet down.

100
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,350
We are going
and that is the end of it. Ya!

101
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,810
That's not your decision to make.

102
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,040
It's Startin' to feel
kinda like home in here.

103
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,310
I'm with mom.
We don't need to go to church.

104
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,480
After all, abuelita,
you don't even believe half that stuff.

105
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,030
- I believe everything.
- Really?

106
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,530
When you take the communion

107
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,580
you believe you're eating
the actual flesh and blood of Jesus?

108
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,680
Ay, no, it's a symbol. Don't be gross.

109
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,140
Okay, so, if you believe that,
then you're protestant.

110
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,060
There is no need for name-calling.

111
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,170
All I know is that a good catholic
does not skip church.

112
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,300
Right, papito?

113
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,630
I like church. I see my friends.

114
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,280
I eat some donuts.

115
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,030
Now, this one gets it.

116
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,270
We're going.

117
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,750
No, we are not!

118
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,980
I work hard all week.

119
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,860
When I get home, there's barely enough
time to have a meal with the kids.

120
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,150
Weekends are my only chance.

121
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,780
So, this Sunday, no church.
End of discussion.

122
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,030
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

123
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,470
What? What'd she say?

124
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,790
I am raising my voice,

125
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,460
because I cannot believe
we're having this discussion!

126
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,630
I'm their mother!
I don't need to ask permission!

127
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:00,750
I decide.

128
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:04,110
And I am your mother,
and I decide what you decide.

129
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,450
We are a family, damn it!

130
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,970
Don't make me choose between you.

131
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:15,520
Okay, I'd choose Lydia because of
her warm food and even warmer hugs.

132
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,140
But I'd feel really bad about it.

133
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,000
All right, everybody, go do your homework.
Schneider, go call one of your moms.

134
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,860
Fine.

135
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,570
Guess I'll just go eat this all alone
in front of my massive TV.

136
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,130
- Thought that was at your dad's house...
- I have one, too!

137
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,970
Ay.

138
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,310
Okay, Mami...

139
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,040
I love you, but I'm their mother

140
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,370
and you're making decisions
that I should be making.

141
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,710
- ¿Ah, Sí?
- Yeah.

142
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,170
Like, I don't like the kids
having dessert every night.

143
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,380
Oh, come on. Es una cosita.

144
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,970
But we have to watch our sugar.
Dad had diabetes.

145
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,760
So, I killed your father?

146
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,280
What? No!

147
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,850
Mami, look around.

148
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,520
I told you, I don't want crosses
and pope stuff everywhere.

149
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,290
My apartment looks like
Jesus' pinterest page.

150
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,650
This is my house,

151
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,300
and I decide if I want obese kids
or the pope staring at me while I pee.

152
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,660
Ah... Yo entiendo.

153
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,200
I cook, I clean,
I teach the children manners...

154
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:19,040
But if I should have an opinion,
you want me to keep my mouth shut.

155
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,120
Ay, exactly.

156
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,620
- Thank you for understanding...
- No!

157
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,750
So I am a servant?

158
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,400
Like cinderella? No, cinderbuela.

159
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,430
No more!

160
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,760
You don't like what I am doing,
I won't do it.

161
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,830
- Mami, please.
- I'll be in my servant's quarters.

162
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,790
Slam!

163
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:45,170
I have to say "slam"
because you would not give me a door!

164
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,820
What?

165
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,140
Eso...

166
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,580
Yeah! Oh.

167
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,190
Where's abuelita?

168
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,200
- Pouting.
- Where's breakfast?

169
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,590
Working on it.

170
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,280
Where's breakfast?

171
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,660
I'm... I'm working on it.

172
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,970
Where are my pants?

173
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,600
You're kidding, right?

174
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,120
How can you not know
where your pants are at?

175
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,880
Abuelita washed them.
She said my cuffs looked shabby.

176
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,460
Who am I to disagree?

177
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,420
All right, Mami, you win!

178
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,930
Where are Alex's pants?

179
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,540
Where's abuelita?

180
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,580
She's small.
She's probably under something.

181
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,130
Kids...

182
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,760
I think your abuelita
has run away from home.

183
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,460
- Hello, Schneider. Listen, have you...
- Wow!

184
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,050
I always forget
how huge your apartment is.

185
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,940
Nah, come on, it's not that big.
But let's talk in the parlor.

186
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,110
Schneider, have you seen my mom?

187
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,320
Gosh, no.

188
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:44,060
Then why do I smell
fried plantains and Cuban coffee?

189
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,890
Fine! She spent the night.

190
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,170
But I want you to know, nothing happened.

191
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,650
What were you thinking,
chasin' that woman away?

192
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,740
She's funny, she's charming,
and when she gets angry,

193
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,840
she cleans.

194
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,160
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

195
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,620
After last night's ugliness,

196
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,040
she spent the night
and left without saying goodbye,

197
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,850
so she already knows the drill.

198
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,230
Unlike some people.

199
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,530
What was that?
And why was she drinking my coffee?

200
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,510
Well, when my family oasis
blew up last night,

201
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:21,200
I had to seek solace in the arms of...

202
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,910
I don't know her name.

203
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,790
Your mom called her the "stick girl"
and made her eat Plato De huevos.

204
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,670
Did abuelita forget to give her
her pants, too?

205
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,820
Well, there's no reason
to get lawyers involved.

206
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,050
My daughter.

207
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:45,390
Katie, if I raised my voice
the other night, I'm sorry.

208
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,940
And I'm sorry for that, too. And that.

209
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,590
No, no, wait, wait, no.

210
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,300
Now I am not going to apologize
for saying "unemployed,"

211
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,280
because that's what you are.

212
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,740
You're so sensitive.

213
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,350
And, sweetheart, I just want
you to be honest with yourself

214
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,480
and ask what happens

215
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,540
if your self-published vampire erotica
doesn't take off.

216
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:17,570
No, no, of course, I believe in you.
It's...

217
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,340
And she's gone.

218
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,800
Well, you know how kids are.

219
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,760
Thirty-seven is a rough age.

220
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,580
Any word from your mom?

221
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,630
No, but I'm sure she's home

222
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:35,900
talking crap about me
with Juan Pablo and benedicto.

223
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,300
Has she ever disappeared
like this before?

224
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,220
No, usually when we fight,
she does the opposite of go away.

225
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,430
She just sighs really loudly.

226
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,310
"Ay!"

227
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,540
Anything to draw attention
to the fact that she's wounded and nearby.

228
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,150
My ex used to have a sigh, too.

229
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,570
It went like this...

230
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,550
"I hate you!"

231
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,630
I still miss her.

232
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,030
I just... I don't...

233
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,620
I don't have time for this drama,
you know?

234
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,750
I got work, I got bills, I got kids.

235
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,210
Well, doesn't she help out?

236
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:14,540
Yeah, she gets the groceries,
cooks, cleans,

237
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,960
spends time with the kids,
does the laundry...

238
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,730
Sounds like she does everything.

239
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,190
Well, it does when I say it out loud.

240
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,890
She's also turning my apartment
into the sistine chapel.

241
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,950
That must look amazing.

242
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,110
Okay, I'm not explaining this right.

243
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,790
Wait, hold on.

244
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,730
Oh, yeah.

245
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,900
Hey, Schneider,
I am just about to leave. What's up?

246
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,230
I just came down to get
my afternoon café con leche

247
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,690
and kiss on the cheek from your mom,

248
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,240
- but she's still not here.
- What?

249
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,870
But don't worry, though. I got this.
All three kids are fine.

250
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,370
- Three?
- Yeah.

251
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,410
Carmen, Elena's best friend?

252
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,270
We have got to catch you up.

253
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,900
I know who Carmen is.
She's the ghost who ate all my chicken.

254
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,570
Hi, Ms. Alvarez.

255
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,900
Takin' you off speaker.

256
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:05,410
Great. Now she's gonna send
her flying monkeys after me.

257
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,700
- And now you're off speaker.
- Schneider!

258
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,830
Oh, my god.

259
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,670
Anyway...

260
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,520
I appreciate you helping me out.

261
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,400
Ah, it's cool.
I had to get out of my apartment.

262
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,500
Stick girl is still up there.

263
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,820
I called her an uber this morning.
The guy never showed.

264
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,340
Maybe it's a sign.

265
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,930
Should I marry her?

266
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,560
Schneider, I gotta go.

267
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,830
Okay, now I'm worried.

268
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,580
She's never not been home
when the kids get there.

269
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,920
And plus, she's 70.

270
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,710
One wrong move and she's down.

271
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,820
You know, the entire world is
one giant, wet bathroom floor.

272
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:48,300
- Any idea where she could be?
- No, none.

273
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,320
Huh...

274
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,700
Where would a devout catholic woman go

275
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:57,790
after an argument with her daughter
about religion?

276
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,630
Thank you, Dr. berkowitz.

277
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,460
Thank you.

278
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,300
But we need to answer the question.

279
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:23,690
Hi, Mami.

280
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,700
So, you just assumed I was here?

281
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,370
Because I'm an ignorant,
old woman married to prayer?

282
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,040
But... you are here.

283
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,920
Still... you shouldn't stereotype.

284
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,220
Hi, birdie.

285
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,850
She is such a suck-up.

286
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:00,750
She thinks she's tan fancy because her
four grandsons are altar boys.

287
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:01,770
Guataca.

288
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,860
Move over.

289
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,440
- Ah-ah!
- Oh!

290
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,910
So...

291
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,020
Have you been here all day?

292
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,790
Getting decorating ideas?

293
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,300
No...

294
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,840
I have been riding around this morning
in something called El uber.

295
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,330
Oh, wow. That must've been expensive.

296
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,660
Schneider set it up. I think it's free.

297
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,500
Oh, I think that car was for stick girl.

298
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,860
Oh, her.

299
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,650
Mami...

300
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,850
I feel terrible about our argument,
but we gotta talk about some things.

301
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,870
Okay.

302
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,520
But you must keep your voice down,

303
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,540
because you-know-who
just put in new batteries.

304
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,320
So... I may have overreacted last night,

305
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,250
but you have to understand,
I'm not gonna be a mom for much longer.

306
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,710
Elena is having her quinces.

307
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,870
Alex is already using hair gel.

308
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,230
And, you know,
soon they're gonna be out of the house.

309
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:29,150
I just... I need you to give me
more space to parent.

310
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:33,070
I understand what you are saying.

311
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,450
- Don't put me in a home.
- What?

312
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:40,930
What, Mami? No, no.
I wouldn't... I'm not gonna do...

313
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,480
I would never do that.
I would never do that!

314
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,150
Ever.

315
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,210
- Oh, no?
- No!

316
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,180
I would never put you in a home.

317
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,670
Mami, where is this coming from?

318
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,290
Your abuela...

319
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,900
Berto's mama, used to live with us...

320
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:11,900
And all day long,
she would slice onions...

321
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,930
The most beautiful paper-thin onions.

322
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,470
I remember.

323
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,470
Nobody could slice an onion like abuela.

324
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,890
Well, it's not that hard.
You need a sharp knife, that's all.

325
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,000
But it made her feel useful.

326
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,940
Problem was, we hated onions.

327
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,010
So, one day we told her.

328
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,870
The next week, dead.

329
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:39,930
Oh...

330
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,200
That's terrible.

331
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,220
I know.

332
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,670
I still get teary when I...

333
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,020
Slice an onion.

334
00:20:54,990 --> 00:21:00,450
Mami, you are the glue
that holds our home together.

335
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,520
Without you, we'd be on the street
living in a cardboard box.

336
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,640
You're just saying that
to cheer me up.

337
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,230
No.

338
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,710
I'm really not. We need you.

339
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,050
So, Mami...

340
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:19,200
Could you make me un cafecito
in the morning for the rest of my life?

341
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,950
Claro.

342
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,560
Aw...

343
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,320
She is like a bat!

344
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:39,990
Shall we?

345
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,970
Yes.

346
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:44,240
And we'll be back Sunday, anyways.

347
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,690
Yeah, you know,
we'll talk about that later.

348
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,650
We'll talk... what's to talk about?

349
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:52,360
Well...

350
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,090
I'm just not sure I wanna go to church...

351
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,130
Maybe ever again.

352
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,130
What?

353
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,850
She said she didn't want to go to church.

354
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,920
Mami!

355
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,400
Don't do that!

356
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,090
Mami, por favor, vámonos ya,

357
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,840
- please!
- You go on.

358
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,030
I will pray for your eternal soul...

359
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,820
And then call El uber.

360
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,450
Hi!

361
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,460
Welcome home, lupita!

362
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,770
We already started,

363
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,570
but I insisted nobody say
anything interesting till you got here.

364
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,570
Aw, that's so sweet.

365
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,840
It's been weird.

366
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,950
Did you find abuelita?

367
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,580
Yeah, she's with Jesus now.

368
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,660
- What?
- No, no!

369
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,710
Sorry. She's at church.
Uh, poor choice of words.

370
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:51,850
Um, church.

371
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,340
Uh, whoa! What do we have here?

372
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,420
Oh, nothing special,
just some nutted quinoa,

373
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,380
wilted broccolini
with radish micro-Greens,

374
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,050
and venison carpaccio
on a bed of nettles.

375
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,950
Grab a cedar plank and dig in.

376
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,620
Big change from abuelita's cooking, huh?

377
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,660
You like it?

378
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,460
I can't wait to have eaten it.

379
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:22,220
I didn't think I would like nettles.
And I was right.

380
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,160
Well, I'm competing with perfection here.

381
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,490
It's okay, Schneider.

382
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:30,560
We all thank you
for this very Caucasian meal.

383
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,880
And good to see you again,
Elena's best friend, Carmen,

384
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,150
you beautiful weirdo.

385
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,300
I'm sorry things got crazy
the other night.

386
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,630
That's... that's not us.

387
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,030
Seems like us.

388
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,390
We have all kinds of arguments
in my family.

389
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:49,990
I have two brothers.
One's a priest, one's a witch, so...

390
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,990
I am... really glad
I'm getting to know you better, Carmen.

391
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,030
Hello!

392
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,140
- Oh!
- Oh, thank god!

393
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,410
I am so glad you're home.

394
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,670
I was wilting under the pressure
to be you.

395
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:18,250
Oh, hello, babies.

396
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:21,780
I'm sure you did fine.
Who threw up on the table?

397
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,340
What were you doing all day?

398
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,640
Oh, you know, saying my rosary,

399
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,290
praying for the departed souls...

400
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,670
Asking forgiveness for your mother.

401
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,730
- Mami.
- Why?

402
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,190
Oh, didn't she tell you?

403
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:43,570
She's no longer going to church. Ever.

404
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,090
We can do that?

405
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,240
You can't.

406
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,080
We will all go together. Us.

407
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,220
Your mother will go hiking with Satan.

408
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,370
Yeah, and then we'll go to applebee's.

409
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:00,940
'Cause Satan loves
the fiesta lime chicken!

410
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,530
So, I guess you want to take
my grandchildren to hell with you.

411
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:08,850
I don't wanna go to hell.

412
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,260
There is no hell.

413
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,620
Don't worry, papito, there is.

414
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,270
Okay! You... you really wanna do this?

415
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,940
All right, let's do this.

416
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,280
I am not even sure
I even believe in god, okay?

417
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,300
Hardcore.

418
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,180
Oye, you're so smart.

419
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:34,540
If god doesn't exist,
who made all of this?

420
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,600
Target.

421
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:41,090
Okay, can we agree
that if there is a god,

422
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,800
it's gender-neutral, not a he or a she?

423
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:47,010
No! God is a man.

424
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,660
If he were a woman,
there would be less problems.

425
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,120
Pobrecito god. He tries so hard.

426
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:57,890
Look, Mami, I get it.
You like going to church. It's habit.

427
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:01,560
You put on lipstick, you get dressed up,
you see your friends, you gossip...

428
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,670
"Oye.
La nieta De olguitita got new tetas."

429
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,470
It's your little social club, Mami,
and that's fine.

430
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,930
It is more than that.

431
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,330
I pray. I seek forgiveness.

432
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,620
And I am so glad
that that gives you comfort.

433
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,310
But that doesn't mean
that god exists, okay? I'm sorry.

434
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,520
He kept you safe.

435
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:28,110
Every day that you were gone,
he kept you safe.

436
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:31,530
My little girl says
she wants to go in the army,

437
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,530
and then the army sends
her to Afghanistan

438
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:38,580
where she is getting shot at
and I don't even know what else...

439
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,670
Have you any idea...

440
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,090
How much I worried?

441
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,280
When you were deployed,

442
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,300
I went to church every day

443
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,590
and I prayed that he would keep you safe.

444
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,970
And he did.

445
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,390
So don't you tell me about god.

446
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:04,270
I know that god exists.

447
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,150
And he is great.

448
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,620
Mami, I'm sorry.

449
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,330
Perdón. Lo siento.

450
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,730
I had no idea.

451
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,690
You know, you went missing for one day

452
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:31,220
and I was worried sick.

453
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:35,930
I can't imagine what it must feel like
to worry all those years.

454
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,470
Ay, Sí.
All those years putting up with birdie,

455
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:43,850
with her terrible hairdos
and her smelly bad breath.

456
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,800
Look...

457
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,380
I still wear the cross you gave me.

458
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,760
So you do believe.

459
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,760
No, I don't wear it because it's a cross.

460
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,020
I wear it because you gave it to me.

461
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,350
I don't understand the difference,
so please just let me have this.

462
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,040
Okay.

463
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,460
So, are we going to church or not?

464
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,120
Yes. Wait, no. Wait... sometimes, okay?

465
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,660
- Sometimes, okay?
- Yeah.

466
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,700
- Well, at least...
- At least Christmas and easter.

467
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,270
And one other time,
so we are not those people.

468
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,670
And I'm not saying god doesn't exist.

469
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:32,230
In fact, I check in with him
constantly, you know, like,

470
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:35,400
"please, god, don't let Elena
come home with a face tattoo."

471
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:41,240
And, Mami, I am glad
that you find comfort in church.

472
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,910
I just find it in different places.

473
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,500
You know, once in Afghanistan...

474
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:51,050
I came out of 20 hours of surgery,
and I was so tired.

475
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,930
I went into the break room
and Serena Williams was on TV.

476
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,080
She was so focused.

477
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,430
She was making these impossible shots.

478
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:06,040
And I just kept thinking about
everything that she had to go through

479
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,710
to get to where she is.

480
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:10,940
All the hours of sacrifice,
all the practice.

481
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,990
And then I just felt like, "okay..."

482
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,610
"If she can do that, then I can do this."

483
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,950
That's how I feel when I watch John cena.

484
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,690
Yes. Exactly.

485
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:31,250
Exactly.
Or Sonia sotomayor... or death.

486
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:38,300
Everyone has something
that inspires them.

487
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,470
Yo entiendo.

488
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:47,350
I also... play Nintendo.

489
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,860
- Good morning.
- Morning.
