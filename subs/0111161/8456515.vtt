Mr. Dufresne,

18
00:02:07.444 --> 00:02:11.697
describe the confrontation you had
with your wife the night she was murdered.

19
00:02:16.328 --> 00:02:18.454
It was very bitter.

20
00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:22.958
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around...

21
00:02:24.378 --> 00:02:27.922
And she said she wanted a divorce in Reno.

22
00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:29.840
What was your response?

23
00:02:29.925 --> 00:02:31.884
I told her I would not grant one.

24
00:02:31.968 --> 00:02:35.012
"I'll see you in hell
before I see you in Reno."

25
00:02:35.097 --> 00:02:38.766
Those were the words you used, Mr.
Dufresne, according to your neighbors.

26
00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:43.562
If they say so.
I really don't remember. I was upset.

27
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.192
What happened after you argued
with your wife?

28
00:02:48.276 --> 00:02:50.194
She packed a bag.

29
00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:54.448
She packed a bag to go and stay with...
Mr. Quentin.

30
00:02:54.533 --> 00:02:56.826
Glenn Quentin.

31
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.994
Golf pro at the Snowdon Hills Country Club.

32
00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.957
The man you discovered
was your wife's lover.

33
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.085
Did you follow her?

34
00:03:07.337 --> 00:03:09.505
I went to a few bars first.

35
00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:12.466
Later, I drove to his
house to confront them.

36
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:16.137
They weren't home, so I...
parked in the turnout,

37
00:03:16.221 --> 00:03:17.805
and waited.

38
00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.099
With what intention?

39
00:03:20.183 --> 00:03:21.976
I'm not sure.

40
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.270
I was confused.

41
00:03:24.354 --> 00:03:26.021
Drunk.

42
00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:30.776
I think... mostly, I wanted to scare them.

43
00:03:30.861 --> 00:03:34.113
When they arrived,
you went up to the house and murdered them.

44
00:03:34.197 --> 00:03:37.283
No. I was sobering up.

45
00:03:37.367 --> 00:03:40.119
I got back in the car,
and I drove home to sleep it off.

46
00:03:40.203 --> 00:03:43.664
Along the way, I stopped,
and I threw my gun into the Royal River.

47
00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:45.958
I feel I've been very clear on this point.

48
00:03:46.042 --> 00:03:49.837
Well, where I get hazy is where the cleaning
woman shows up the following morning

49
00:03:49.921 --> 00:03:55.593
and finds your wife in bed with her lover,
riddled with .38 caliber bullets.

50
00:03:56.636 --> 00:04:00.890
Now, does that strike you as a fantastic
coincidence, Mr. Dufresne, or is it just me?

51
00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:02.808
Yes, it does.

52
00:04:02.893 --> 00:04:08.981
Yet you still maintain that you threw your gun
into the river before the murders took place?

53
00:04:09.065 --> 00:04:12.860
- That's very convenient.
- It's the truth.

54
00:04:12.944 --> 00:04:17.656
The police dragged that river
for three days, and nary a gun was found.

55
00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:20.534
So, there could be no comparison made
between your gun

56
00:04:20.619 --> 00:04:24.789
and the bullets taken from
the bloodstained corpses of the victims.

57
00:04:26.082 --> 00:04:28.959
And that also...

58
00:04:29.044 --> 00:04:31.045
is very convenient.

59
00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:32.630
Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

60
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.091
Since I am innocent of this crime, sir,

61
00:04:36.176 --> 00:04:39.762
I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

62
00:04:40.931 --> 00:04:43.015
If I Didn't Care

63
00:04:46.937 --> 00:04:50.189
♪ And would I be sure that this

64
00:04:50.273 --> 00:04:54.902
♪ Is love beyond compare...

65
00:04:58.448 --> 00:05:01.367
Ladies and gentlemen,
you've heard all the evidence.

66
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:04.036
We have the accused at
the scene of the crime.

67
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.955
We have footprints, tire tracks,

68
00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:10.084
bullets strewn on the ground which bear
his fingerprints, a broken bourbon bottle,

69
00:05:10.168 --> 00:05:12.294
likewise with fingerprints.

70
00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:14.046
And most of all,

71
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.423
we have a beautiful young
woman and her lover

72
00:05:16.508 --> 00:05:18.592
lying dead in each other's arms.

73
00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:22.930
They had sinned.

74
00:05:24.558 --> 00:05:28.561
But was their crime so great
as to merit a death sentence?

75
00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:31.814
Now, while you think about that...

76
00:05:33.525 --> 00:05:36.026
...think about this.

77
00:05:36.111 --> 00:05:38.654
A revolver holds six bullets.

78
00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:40.114
Not eight.

79
00:05:40.198 --> 00:05:43.659
I submit that this was not a hot-blooded
crime of passion.

80
00:05:43.743 --> 00:05:46.787
That could be understood, if not condoned.

81
00:05:46.872 --> 00:05:49.498
No. This was revenge...

82
00:05:49.583 --> 00:05:54.086
of a much more brutal
and cold-blooded nature. Consider this.

83
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.714
Four bullets per victim.

84
00:05:56.798 --> 00:05:59.174
Not six shots fired, but eight.

85
00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:03.178
That means that he fired the gun empty,

86
00:06:03.263 --> 00:06:05.556
and then stopped to reload...

87
00:06:06.641 --> 00:06:09.226
...so that he could shoot
each of them again.

88
00:06:09.311 --> 00:06:11.896
An extra bullet per lover.

89
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.023
Right in the head.

90
00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:22.990
You strike me as a particularly icy
and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

91
00:06:23.074 --> 00:06:25.326
It chills my blood just to look at you.

92
00:06:27.078 --> 00:06:30.039
By the power vested in me
by the state of Maine,

93
00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:33.667
I hereby order you to serve two
life sentences, back to back.

94
00:06:34.753 --> 00:06:37.379
One for each of your victims. So be it.

95
00:07:02.405 --> 00:07:04.073
Sit.

96
00:07:08.119 --> 00:07:11.038
We see by your file
you've served 20 years of a life sentence.

97
00:07:11.122 --> 00:07:12.706
Yes, sir.

98
00:07:12.791 --> 00:07:15.250
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

99
00:07:15.335 --> 00:07:17.544
Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

100
00:07:19.172 --> 00:07:21.131
I mean, I learned my lesson.

101
00:07:22.217 --> 00:07:25.469
I can honestly say... I'm a changed man.

102
00:07:29.182 --> 00:07:31.517
I'm no longer a danger to society.

103
00:07:31.601 --> 00:07:33.686
That's God's honest truth.

104
00:08:09.848 --> 00:08:12.641
Hey, Red. How'd it go?

105
00:08:12.726 --> 00:08:15.352
Same old shit. Different day.

106
00:08:15.437 --> 00:08:19.064
Yeah. I know how you feel.
I'm up for rejection next week.

107
00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:22.818
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

108
00:08:22.902 --> 00:08:24.194
It happens.

109
00:08:24.279 --> 00:08:25.863
Hey, Red. Bump me a deck.

110
00:08:25.947 --> 00:08:29.324
Get the fuck out of my face, will you, man?
You've had five packs already.

111
00:08:29.409 --> 00:08:30.617
- Four.
- Five.

112
00:08:31.661 --> 00:08:35.205
There must be a con like me
in every prison in America.

113
00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:37.207
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

114
00:08:37.292 --> 00:08:40.419
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer...
if that's your thing...

115
00:08:40.503 --> 00:08:44.089
a bottle of brandy to celebrate
your kid's high-school graduation.

116
00:08:44.174 --> 00:08:46.508
Damn near anything, within reason.

117
00:08:46.593 --> 00:08:48.886
Yes, sir. I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.

118
00:08:53.224 --> 00:08:56.602
So, when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949

119
00:08:56.686 --> 00:09:00.022
and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth
into the prison for him,

120
00:09:00.106 --> 00:09:02.191
I told him, "No problem."

121
00:09:44.275 --> 00:09:46.568
Andy came to Shawshank Prison

122
00:09:46.653 --> 00:09:50.781
in early 1947, for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging.

123
00:09:50.865 --> 00:09:55.160
On the outside he had been vice-president
of a large Portland bank.

124
00:09:55.245 --> 00:09:57.246
Good work for a man as young as he was.

125
00:10:02.627 --> 00:10:04.294
Hey, Red.

126
00:10:40.456 --> 00:10:44.001
Do you speak English, butt steak?
You follow this officer.

127
00:10:56.973 --> 00:11:01.351
I haven't seen such a sorry-looking heap
of m-m-maggot shit in all my life.

128
00:11:01.436 --> 00:11:03.520
Hey, fish! Come over here.

129
00:11:18.578 --> 00:11:21.455
Come on, fish.

130
00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.837
Taking bets today, Red?

131
00:11:28.922 --> 00:11:30.923
Smokes or coins? Better's choice.

132
00:11:31.007 --> 00:11:32.799
Smokes. Put me down for two.

133
00:11:32.884 --> 00:11:34.927
All right. Who's your horse?

134
00:11:35.011 --> 00:11:38.305
That little sack of shit...
eighth from the front.

135
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:39.556
He'll be first.

136
00:11:39.641 --> 00:11:41.850
- Bullshit. I'll take that action.
- Me too.

137
00:11:41.935 --> 00:11:44.186
You're out some smokes, son.
Let me tell you.

138
00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.188
Heywood, you're so smart, you call it.

139
00:11:46.272 --> 00:11:48.774
I'll take... t-t-the chubby fat-ass there.

140
00:11:48.858 --> 00:11:52.236
The fifth one from the front.
Put me down for a quarter deck.

141
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.197
Fresh fish!

142
00:11:55.281 --> 00:11:59.368
Fresh fish today! We're reeling them in!

143
00:11:59.826 --> 00:12:04.079
I must admit, I didn't think much of Andy,
first time I laid eyes on him.

144
00:12:04.164 --> 00:12:07.666
Looked like a stiff breeze
would blow him over.

145
00:12:07.751 --> 00:12:10.044
That was my first impression of the man.

146
00:12:10.128 --> 00:12:11.837
What do you say, Red?

147
00:12:11.921 --> 00:12:15.174
That tall drink of water
with the silver spoon up his ass.

148
00:12:15.258 --> 00:12:17.426
That guy? Never happen.

149
00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:18.636
Ten cigarettes.

150
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.887
That's a rich bet.

151
00:12:19.971 --> 00:12:22.181
All right. Who's gonna prove me wrong?

152
00:12:22.265 --> 00:12:24.350
Heywood? Jigger?

153
00:12:24.434 --> 00:12:25.893
Skeet?

154
00:12:25.977 --> 00:12:28.187
Floyd?

155
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:30.397
Four brave souls.

156
00:12:30.482 --> 00:12:33.317
Return to your cell
blocks for evening count.

157
00:12:33.401 --> 00:12:35.903
All prisoners return to your cell blocks.

158
00:12:57.008 --> 00:12:59.093
Turn to the right. Eyes front.

159
00:13:12.524 --> 00:13:15.526
This is Mr. Hadley. He's
Captain of the Guards.

160
00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:17.778
I'm Mr. Norton, the Warden.

161
00:13:17.862 --> 00:13:20.364
You are convicted felons.

162
00:13:20.448 --> 00:13:22.783
That's why they've sent you to me.

163
00:13:22.867 --> 00:13:24.493
Rule number one:

164
00:13:24.577 --> 00:13:26.453
No blasphemy.

165
00:13:26.538 --> 00:13:30.082
I'll not have the Lord's name taken in vain
in my prison.

166
00:13:30.166 --> 00:13:31.542
The other rules...

167
00:13:31.626 --> 00:13:33.335
you'll figure out as you go along.

168
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.212
Any questions?

169
00:13:35.296 --> 00:13:36.505
When do we eat?

170
00:13:45.014 --> 00:13:47.182
You eat when we say you eat!

171
00:13:47.267 --> 00:13:50.644
You shit when we say you shit,
and you piss when we say you piss.

172
00:13:50.729 --> 00:13:53.605
You got that, you maggot-dick motherfucker?

173
00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:54.982
Aarghh!

174
00:13:55.066 --> 00:13:57.025
On your feet.

175
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:58.902
I believe in two things.

176
00:13:58.987 --> 00:14:01.864
Discipline and the Bible.

177
00:14:01.948 --> 00:14:03.782
Here you'll receive both.

178
00:14:04.909 --> 00:14:07.536
Put your trust in the Lord.

179
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.496
Your ass belongs to me.

180
00:14:11.583 --> 00:14:13.667
Welcome to Shawshank.

181
00:14:18.798 --> 00:14:20.215
Unhook 'em.

182
00:14:25.472 --> 00:14:27.347
Turn around.

183
00:14:32.929 --> 00:14:35.263
That's enough.

184
00:14:35.348 --> 00:14:38.099
Move to the end of the cage.

185
00:14:38.184 --> 00:14:39.559
Turn around.

186
00:14:39.644 --> 00:14:40.894
Delouse him.

187
00:14:42.656 --> 00:14:44.532
Turn around.

188
00:14:47.119 --> 00:14:49.574
Move out of the cage, go left.
Pick up your clothes and Bible.

189
00:14:49.824 --> 00:14:51.367
Next man up.

190
00:14:53.495 --> 00:14:56.664
To the right. Right, right, right.

191
00:14:56.748 --> 00:14:58.290
Left, left...

192
00:14:58.375 --> 00:15:02.544
The first night's the toughest.
No doubt about it.

193
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:05.756
They march you in,
naked as the day you were born,

194
00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:09.927
skin burning and half-blind
from that delousing shit they throw on you.

195
00:15:10.011 --> 00:15:12.972
And when they put you in that cell,

196
00:15:13.056 --> 00:15:15.724
and those bars slam home...

197
00:15:15.809 --> 00:15:18.560
that's when you know it's for real.

198
00:15:18.645 --> 00:15:21.981
Old life blown away in the blink of an eye.

199
00:15:22.065 --> 00:15:23.273
Nothing left,

200
00:15:23.358 --> 00:15:26.068
but all the time in the
world to think about it.

201
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.073
Most new fish come close to madness
the first night.

202
00:15:31.157 --> 00:15:34.451
Somebody always breaks down crying.

203
00:15:34.536 --> 00:15:36.996
Happens every time.

204
00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.164
The only question is:

205
00:15:39.249 --> 00:15:40.666
Who's it gonna be?

206
00:15:41.751 --> 00:15:44.336
It's as good a thing to
bet on as any, I guess.

207
00:15:46.256 --> 00:15:48.340
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

208
00:15:57.976 --> 00:15:59.601
Lights out!

209
00:16:20.123 --> 00:16:23.208
I remember my first night.

210
00:16:23.293 --> 00:16:25.377
Seems like a long time ago.

211
00:16:26.921 --> 00:16:29.381
Yoo-hoo!

212
00:16:29.466 --> 00:16:31.967
Hey, fish.

213
00:16:32.052 --> 00:16:35.095
Fish, fish, fish, fish, fishy.

214
00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:39.099
- Boy, are you scared of the dark?
- You like it here, new fish?

215
00:16:39.184 --> 00:16:41.518
You'll wish
your daddy never dicked your mommy.

216
00:16:41.603 --> 00:16:45.606
Fishy! Oh, I want me a pork chop. Oh, yes!

217
00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:50.736
You taking this down, new fish?
There's gonna be a quiz later!

218
00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.198
- Poke your ass out, give me a first look!
- Shh! Keep it down.

219
00:16:54.282 --> 00:16:57.618
The boys always go fishing
with first-timers.

220
00:16:57.702 --> 00:16:59.745
They don't quit till they reel someone in.

221
00:17:02.415 --> 00:17:04.917
Hey, Fat Ass.

222
00:17:05.001 --> 00:17:06.668
Fat Ass.

223
00:17:07.879 --> 00:17:10.339
Talk to me, boy.

224
00:17:10.423 --> 00:17:13.133
I know you're there. I
can hear you breathing.

225
00:17:13.218 --> 00:17:16.136
Don't you listen to these nitwits.
You hear me?

226
00:17:16.221 --> 00:17:18.305
This place ain't so bad.

227
00:17:18.389 --> 00:17:20.015
I tell you what.

228
00:17:21.184 --> 00:17:24.353
I'll introduce you around.
Make you feel right at home.

229
00:17:24.437 --> 00:17:27.022
I know a couple of big old bull queers

230
00:17:27.107 --> 00:17:30.067
that would just love to
make your acquaintance.

231
00:17:30.151 --> 00:17:33.570
Especially that big, white,
m-mushy butt of yours.

232
00:17:33.655 --> 00:17:35.572
God!

233
00:17:35.657 --> 00:17:37.157
I don't belong here!

234
00:17:37.242 --> 00:17:38.659
We have a winner!

235
00:17:38.743 --> 00:17:40.494
I wanna go home!

236
00:17:40.578 --> 00:17:42.412
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

237
00:17:42.497 --> 00:17:45.666
Hey, it's the fat guy! It's the fat guy!

238
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:49.586
Fresh fish! Fresh fish! Fresh fish!

239
00:17:49.671 --> 00:17:52.381
I don't belong here!

240
00:17:52.465 --> 00:17:53.674
Fresh fish!

241
00:17:53.758 --> 00:17:57.094
I wanna go home. I want my mommy.

242
00:17:57.178 --> 00:18:00.180
I had your mother. She wasn't that great.

243
00:18:00.265 --> 00:18:01.765
Fresh fish!

244
00:18:04.317 --> 00:18:06.816
What the Christ is this happy horse shit?

245
00:18:06.817 --> 00:18:09.527
He took the Lord's name in vain.
I'm telling the Warden.

246
00:18:09.612 --> 00:18:11.112
With my baton up your ass!

247
00:18:11.197 --> 00:18:12.864
Let me out of here!

248
00:18:12.948 --> 00:18:16.326
What is your malfunction,
you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

249
00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:17.577
Please...

250
00:18:17.661 --> 00:18:19.704
I ain't supposed to be here.

251
00:18:19.788 --> 00:18:21.164
Not me!

252
00:18:21.248 --> 00:18:23.708
I ain't gonna count to three, or even one.

253
00:18:23.792 --> 00:18:26.085
Shut the fuck up, or
I'll sing you a lullaby!

254
00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:28.004
Shut up, man. Shut up.

255
00:18:28.088 --> 00:18:29.380
There's been a mistake!

256
00:18:29.465 --> 00:18:32.634
You don't understand.
I'm not supposed to be here!

257
00:18:32.718 --> 00:18:33.801
Open that cell.

258
00:18:33.886 --> 00:18:38.056
Me neither. You people run this
place like a fucking prison!

259
00:18:45.523 --> 00:18:47.565
Son of a bitch.

260
00:18:51.737 --> 00:18:53.821
Take it easy.

261
00:19:16.095 --> 00:19:19.473
If I hear so much as a mouse fart in here
the rest of the night,

262
00:19:19.557 --> 00:19:23.226
I swear by God and sonny Jesus,
you will all visit the infirmary.

263
00:19:23.311 --> 00:19:25.395
Every last motherfucker in here.

264
00:19:29.317 --> 00:19:32.986
Call the trustees. Take that tub
of shit down to the infirmary.

265
00:19:47.293 --> 00:19:52.005
His first night in the joint, Andy
Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes.

266
00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:54.966
He never made a sound.

267
00:20:10.483 --> 00:20:13.735
Tier 3 North. Clear.

268
00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.987
Tier 2 South. Clear.

269
00:20:16.072 --> 00:20:17.948
Tier 3 South. Clear.

270
00:20:18.032 --> 00:20:19.991
Tier 1 North...

271
00:20:20.076 --> 00:20:22.869
- Tier 1 South. Clear.
- Tier 4 South. Clear.

272
00:20:22.954 --> 00:20:25.038
Prepare to roll out.

273
00:20:28.417 --> 00:20:30.502
Roll out!

274
00:21:23.389 --> 00:21:26.183
Are... Are you going to eat that?

275
00:21:26.267 --> 00:21:29.186
I hadn't... I hadn't planned on it.

276
00:21:30.438 --> 00:21:31.479
Do you mind?

277
00:21:38.821 --> 00:21:41.448
Ah... that's nice and ripe.

278
00:21:53.044 --> 00:21:55.503
Jake says thank you.

279
00:21:55.588 --> 00:21:58.006
Fell out of his nest
over by the plate shop.

280
00:22:00.259 --> 00:22:04.804
I'm going to look after him
until he's big enough to fly.

281
00:22:04.889 --> 00:22:06.681
Oh, no, no. Here he comes.

282
00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:13.730
Morning, fellas. Fine morning, ain't it?

283
00:22:13.814 --> 00:22:16.233
You know why it's a fine
morning, don't you?

284
00:22:16.317 --> 00:22:18.735
Come on. Set 'em down.
I want 'em all lined up here,

285
00:22:18.819 --> 00:22:21.613
just like a pretty little chorus line.

286
00:22:21.697 --> 00:22:23.782
Yeah, look at that!

287
00:22:23.866 --> 00:22:26.743
- Look at that. Oh, Lord!
- I can't stand this guy.

288
00:22:27.954 --> 00:22:30.622
Yes. Richmond, Virginia.

289
00:22:30.706 --> 00:22:32.791
- Smell my ass!
- After he smells mine.

290
00:22:32.875 --> 00:22:38.213
Gee, Red, it was a terrible shame
about your horse coming in last, an' all.

291
00:22:38.297 --> 00:22:41.508
But I sure do love that winning
horse of mine, though.

292
00:22:42.003 --> 00:22:44.713
I owe that boy a great big, sloppy kiss
when I see him.

293
00:22:44.798 --> 00:22:47.800
Why don't you give him some
of your cigarettes, instead?

294
00:22:47.884 --> 00:22:49.677
Lucky fuck.

295
00:22:49.761 --> 00:22:50.764
Hey, Tyrell.

296
00:22:51.015 --> 00:22:53.976
You pull infirmary duty this week?

297
00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.769
How's that horse of mine doing?

298
00:22:55.854 --> 00:22:57.312
Dead.

299
00:22:57.397 --> 00:23:02.776
Hadley busted his head up pretty good. The
doc had already gone home for the night.

300
00:23:02.777 --> 00:23:05.529
Poor bastard lay there till this morning.

301
00:23:05.613 --> 00:23:08.448
By then, hell, there weren't
nothing we could do.

302
00:23:14.247 --> 00:23:15.831
What was his name?

303
00:23:19.085 --> 00:23:20.460
What did you say?

304
00:23:22.338 --> 00:23:24.715
I was just wondering if
anyone knew his name.

305
00:23:24.799 --> 00:23:27.509
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

306
00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:32.347
It doesn't fuckin' matter
what his name was. He's dead.

307
00:23:51.701 --> 00:23:54.036
Hey...

308
00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.872
Anybody come at you yet?

309
00:23:58.374 --> 00:24:00.375
Anybody get to you yet?

310
00:24:01.502 --> 00:24:04.546
Hey, we all need friends in here.

311
00:24:04.631 --> 00:24:06.548
I could be a friend to you.

312
00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:10.677
Hey...

313
00:24:15.516 --> 00:24:17.392
Hard to get.

314
00:24:19.062 --> 00:24:20.729
I like that.

315
00:24:27.362 --> 00:24:30.656
Andy kept pretty much to himself at first.

316
00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.200
I guess he had a lot on his mind,

317
00:24:33.284 --> 00:24:35.494
trying to adapt to life on the inside.

318
00:24:37.038 --> 00:24:39.748
It wasn't until a month went by
that he opened his mouth

319
00:24:39.832 --> 00:24:42.125
to say more than two words to somebody.

320
00:24:44.045 --> 00:24:46.088
As it turned out...

321
00:24:46.172 --> 00:24:48.090
that somebody was me.

322
00:24:51.678 --> 00:24:55.847
Officers Russell and Burwell
report to the duty officer.

323
00:24:56.891 --> 00:24:59.643
I'm Andy Dufresne.

324
00:24:59.727 --> 00:25:01.812
The wife-killing banker.

325
00:25:03.648 --> 00:25:05.357
Why did you do it?

326
00:25:05.441 --> 00:25:07.067
I didn't, since you ask.

327
00:25:07.151 --> 00:25:10.195
You're gonna fit right in!

328
00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:13.448
Everybody in here's innocent.
Didn't you know that?

329
00:25:13.533 --> 00:25:16.868
- Heywood, what are you in here for?
- Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

330
00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:22.582
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

331
00:25:22.667 --> 00:25:26.420
You think your shit smells sweeter
than most. Is that right?

332
00:25:26.504 --> 00:25:28.839
- What do you think?
- To tell you the truth,

333
00:25:28.923 --> 00:25:32.009
I haven't made up my mind.

334
00:25:32.093 --> 00:25:36.179
I understand
you're a man that knows how to get things.

335
00:25:36.264 --> 00:25:39.766
I'm known to locate certain things,
from time to time.

336
00:25:39.851 --> 00:25:42.853
- I wonder if you might get me a rock hammer.
- A what?

337
00:25:42.937 --> 00:25:44.313
A rock hammer.

338
00:25:44.397 --> 00:25:46.690
- What is it, and why?
- What do you care?

339
00:25:48.568 --> 00:25:51.445
Well, if it was a toothbrush,
I'd just quote a price,

340
00:25:51.529 --> 00:25:54.114
but then a toothbrush
is a non-lethal object.

341
00:25:55.533 --> 00:25:57.242
Fair enough.

342
00:25:57.327 --> 00:25:59.786
A rock hammer
is about six or seven inches long.

343
00:25:59.871 --> 00:26:01.496
Looks like a miniature pickaxe.

344
00:26:01.581 --> 00:26:02.706
Pickaxe?

345
00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:04.875
- For rocks.
- Rocks.

346
00:26:06.544 --> 00:26:08.712
Quartz?

347
00:26:08.796 --> 00:26:10.464
Quartz.

348
00:26:11.716 --> 00:26:14.092
And some mica.

349
00:26:14.177 --> 00:26:15.344
Shale.

350
00:26:16.429 --> 00:26:18.013
Limestone.

351
00:26:18.097 --> 00:26:20.015
So?

352
00:26:20.099 --> 00:26:22.184
So, I'm a rock hound.

353
00:26:22.268 --> 00:26:25.479
At least, I was in my old life.
I'd like to be again on a limited basis.

354
00:26:25.563 --> 00:26:27.689
Or maybe you want
to hammer somebody's skull.

355
00:26:27.774 --> 00:26:29.232
No, sir.

356
00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.943
I have no enemies here.

357
00:26:32.028 --> 00:26:34.404
No? Wait a while.

358
00:26:35.948 --> 00:26:38.116
Word gets around.

359
00:26:38.201 --> 00:26:41.328
The Sisters have taken
quite a liking to you.

360
00:26:41.412 --> 00:26:43.205
Especially Bogs.

361
00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:48.502
I don't suppose it would help any
if I explained to them I'm not homosexual.

362
00:26:48.586 --> 00:26:50.087
Neither are they.

363
00:26:50.171 --> 00:26:52.881
You have to be human first.
They don't qualify.

364
00:26:58.137 --> 00:27:02.682
Bull queers take by force.
It's all they want or understand.

365
00:27:02.767 --> 00:27:06.395
If I were you,
I'd grow eyes in the back of my head.

366
00:27:06.479 --> 00:27:07.813
Thanks for the advice.

367
00:27:07.897 --> 00:27:09.481
Well, that's free.

368
00:27:09.565 --> 00:27:11.817
You understand my concern.

369
00:27:11.901 --> 00:27:14.444
Well, if there's any trouble,
I won't use the hammer.

370
00:27:14.529 --> 00:27:18.740
Then I guess you want to escape.
Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

371
00:27:20.201 --> 00:27:21.993
Did I miss something? What's funny?

372
00:27:22.078 --> 00:27:25.122
You'll understand
when you see the rock hammer.

373
00:27:26.999 --> 00:27:29.000
What's an item like this usually go for?

374
00:27:29.085 --> 00:27:32.129
Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.

375
00:27:32.213 --> 00:27:34.923
My normal mark-up's 20 per cent.

376
00:27:34.924 --> 00:27:37.467
But this is a specialty item.

377
00:27:37.552 --> 00:27:40.137
The risk goes up, the price goes up.

378
00:27:40.138 --> 00:27:42.097
Let's make it an even ten bucks.

379
00:27:42.181 --> 00:27:44.057
Ten it is.

380
00:27:45.143 --> 00:27:47.561
Waste of money, if you ask me.

381
00:27:47.645 --> 00:27:49.187
Why's that?

382
00:27:50.273 --> 00:27:53.316
Folks around this joint
love surprise inspections.

383
00:27:54.902 --> 00:27:57.195
If they find it, you're gonna lose it.

384
00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.406
If they do catch you with
it, you don't know me.

385
00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:01.700
Mention my name, we never
do business again.

386
00:28:01.784 --> 00:28:04.911
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.
Now, you got that?

387
00:28:06.414 --> 00:28:07.831
I understand.

388
00:28:07.915 --> 00:28:09.332
Thank you...

389
00:28:09.333 --> 00:28:10.959
Mr. er...?

390
00:28:11.043 --> 00:28:13.503
Red. The name's Red.

391
00:28:13.504 --> 00:28:14.546
Red?

392
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:17.382
Why do they call you that?

393
00:28:21.053 --> 00:28:23.138
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

394
00:28:31.105 --> 00:28:34.149
I could see
why some of the boys took him for snobby.

395
00:28:34.233 --> 00:28:37.652
He had a quiet way about him.

396
00:28:37.737 --> 00:28:42.199
A walk and a talk
that just wasn't normal around here.

397
00:28:42.283 --> 00:28:43.825
He strolled...

398
00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:48.246
like a man in a park,
without a care or worry in the world.

399
00:28:48.331 --> 00:28:53.043
Like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place.

400
00:28:53.127 --> 00:28:57.297
Yeah. I think it would be fair to say...

401
00:28:57.298 --> 00:28:59.382
I liked Andy from the start.

402
00:29:01.135 --> 00:29:04.346
Let's go!
Some of us have got a schedule to keep.

403
00:29:08.397 --> 00:29:10.481
Move it! Come on. Move it!

404
00:29:14.111 --> 00:29:17.238
Bob, how are you doing?
How's the wife treating you?

405
00:29:26.957 --> 00:29:28.416
Easy.

406
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.584
Keep it moving.

407
00:29:33.381 --> 00:29:34.631
Red...

408
00:29:54.653 --> 00:29:58.864
Andy was right. I finally got the joke.

409
00:29:58.949 --> 00:30:03.452
It would take a man about 600 years
to tunnel under the wall with one of these.

410
00:30:07.791 --> 00:30:08.916
Book?

411
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.876
Not today.

412
00:30:16.216 --> 00:30:18.300
- Book?
- No.

413
00:30:20.095 --> 00:30:21.303
Hey, Brooksy.

414
00:30:24.599 --> 00:30:26.684
Delivery for Dufresne.

415
00:30:33.775 --> 00:30:39.405
Book?

416
00:30:42.409 --> 00:30:44.535
Dufresne...

417
00:30:44.619 --> 00:30:46.787
Here's your book.

418
00:30:51.209 --> 00:30:52.877
Thanks.

419
00:30:56.715 --> 00:30:59.925
Dufresne! We're running low on Hexlite.

420
00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:02.094
Get on back and fetch us up some.

421
00:31:39.299 --> 00:31:41.258
If you get this in your
eyes, it blinds you.

422
00:31:41.343 --> 00:31:44.094
Honey... hush.

423
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:58.567
That's it. You fight.

424
00:31:58.652 --> 00:32:00.235
It's better that way.

425
00:32:08.662 --> 00:32:11.497
I wish I could tell you
that Andy fought the good fight,

426
00:32:11.581 --> 00:32:14.124
and the Sisters let him be.

427
00:32:14.209 --> 00:32:16.210
I wish I could tell you that.

428
00:32:16.294 --> 00:32:18.379
But prison is no fairy-tale world.

429
00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:22.466
He never said who did it.

430
00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:25.594
But we all knew.

431
00:32:28.932 --> 00:32:31.809
Things went on like that for a while.

432
00:32:31.893 --> 00:32:34.520
Prison life consists of routine...

433
00:32:34.604 --> 00:32:36.814
and then more routine.

434
00:32:39.192 --> 00:32:43.028
Every so often,
Andy would show up with fresh bruises.

435
00:32:44.197 --> 00:32:46.240
The Sisters kept at him.

436
00:32:46.324 --> 00:32:50.452
Sometimes he was able to fight 'em off.
Sometimes not.

437
00:32:50.537 --> 00:32:51.820
And that's how it went for Andy.

438
00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:54.914
That was his routine.

439
00:32:54.998 --> 00:32:58.792
I do believe those first two
years were the worst for him.

440
00:32:58.877 --> 00:33:01.128
And I also believe,

441
00:33:01.213 --> 00:33:05.758
if things had gone on that way,
this place would have got the best of him.

442
00:33:05.842 --> 00:33:08.802
But then, in the spring of 1949,

443
00:33:08.887 --> 00:33:10.888
the powers that be decided that...

444
00:33:10.972 --> 00:33:14.391
The roof of the license-plate factory
needs resurfacing.

445
00:33:14.476 --> 00:33:17.228
I need a dozen volunteers
for a week's work.

446
00:33:18.396 --> 00:33:20.523
As you know,

447
00:33:20.607 --> 00:33:24.318
special detail carries with
it special privileges.

448
00:33:24.402 --> 00:33:26.487
It was outdoor detail...

449
00:33:27.989 --> 00:33:31.575
...and May is one damn fine month
to be working outdoors.

450
00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:33.285
Stay in line there.

451
00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:36.288
More than a hundred men
volunteered for the job.

452
00:33:40.669 --> 00:33:42.962
Wallace E Unger.

453
00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:46.590
Ellis Redding.

454
00:33:46.675 --> 00:33:49.510
Wouldn't you know it?

455
00:33:49.594 --> 00:33:52.179
Me and some fellows I know
were among the names.

456
00:33:52.264 --> 00:33:54.348
Andrew Dufresne.

457
00:33:54.432 --> 00:33:57.977
It only cost us a pack of smokes per man.

458
00:33:58.061 --> 00:34:00.771
I made my usual 20 per cent, of course.

459
00:34:00.855 --> 00:34:04.441
So, this big-shot lawyer
calls me long-distance from Texas.

460
00:34:04.526 --> 00:34:06.235
I say, "Yeah?"

461
00:34:06.319 --> 00:34:10.030
He says, "Sorry to inform you,
but your brother just died."

462
00:34:10.115 --> 00:34:12.616
Oh, damn, Byron. I'm sorry to hear that.

463
00:34:12.701 --> 00:34:14.076
I'm not. He was an asshole.

464
00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.495
Ran off years ago.
Figured him for dead, anyway.

465
00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:20.541
So, anyway, this lawyer fella says to me,
"Your brother died a rich man."

466
00:34:20.625 --> 00:34:23.335
Oil wells and shit. Close
to a million bucks.

467
00:34:24.287 --> 00:34:25.545
A million bucks?

468
00:34:26.046 --> 00:34:28.422
Fucking incredible
how lucky some assholes get.

469
00:34:28.507 --> 00:34:31.050
Jeez-Louise! Are you gonna see any of that?

470
00:34:31.134 --> 00:34:34.220
35,000. That's what he left me.

471
00:34:34.304 --> 00:34:36.222
- Dollars?
- Yeah.

472
00:34:36.306 --> 00:34:39.433
Holy shit! That's great.
That's like winning the sweepstakes.

473
00:34:39.518 --> 00:34:40.726
Isn't it?

474
00:34:40.811 --> 00:34:43.854
Dumb shit. What do you think
the government's gonna do to me?

475
00:34:43.939 --> 00:34:46.482
Take a big, wet bite out
of my ass, is what.

476
00:34:46.483 --> 00:34:50.653
Poor Byron! Terrible fucking luck, huh?

477
00:34:50.859 --> 00:34:52.781
Crying shame.

478
00:34:53.031 --> 00:34:54.698
Some people really got it awful!

479
00:34:54.784 --> 00:34:56.326
Andy, are you nuts?

480
00:34:56.784 --> 00:34:58.910
Keep your eyes on your mop, man. Andy!

481
00:34:58.911 --> 00:35:01.955
Well, you'll pay some tax,
but you'll still end up...

482
00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.875
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Maybe enough to buy a new car. Then what?

483
00:35:04.959 --> 00:35:07.336
I've got to pay tax on the car.

484
00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:11.298
Repair, maintenance, goddamn kids
pestering me to take them for a ride...

485
00:35:11.382 --> 00:35:15.302
And at the end of the year, you figure the tax
wrong, you pay them out of your own pocket.

486
00:35:15.386 --> 00:35:17.554
I tell you... Uncle Sam!

487
00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:21.762
He puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

488
00:35:21.847 --> 00:35:24.557
- Andy! Andy!
- What's he doing?

489
00:35:24.641 --> 00:35:26.976
- Getting himself killed.
- Keep tarring.

490
00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:30.146
Some brother! Shit.

491
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:31.272
Hey!

492
00:35:34.609 --> 00:35:36.819
Mr. Hadley...

493
00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:38.279
do you trust your wife?

494
00:35:39.823 --> 00:35:41.574
Oh, that's funny.

495
00:35:41.658 --> 00:35:44.535
You're gonna look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

496
00:35:44.619 --> 00:35:48.080
I mean, do you think she'd go behind
your back, try to hamstring you?

497
00:35:49.166 --> 00:35:51.042
That's it. Step aside, Mert.

498
00:35:51.126 --> 00:35:52.626
This fucker's having an accident.

499
00:35:52.711 --> 00:35:53.878
He's gonna push him off.

500
00:35:53.962 --> 00:35:58.090
Cos if you do trust her, there's no
reason you can't keep that 35,000.

501
00:35:58.175 --> 00:36:00.051
- What did you say?
- 35,000.

502
00:36:00.135 --> 00:36:01.844
- 35,000?
- All of it.

503
00:36:01.845 --> 00:36:04.180
- All of it?
- Every penny.

504
00:36:04.264 --> 00:36:06.098
You'd better start making sense.

505
00:36:06.183 --> 00:36:08.517
If you want to keep the money,
give it to your wife.

506
00:36:08.602 --> 00:36:12.730
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $60,000.

507
00:36:12.814 --> 00:36:14.356
Bullshit! Tax-free?

508
00:36:14.357 --> 00:36:17.526
Tax-free. The IRS can't touch one cent.

509
00:36:17.611 --> 00:36:20.196
You're the smart banker
what killed his wife.

510
00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:23.824
Why should I believe a smart banker like
you? So I can end up in here with you?

511
00:36:23.909 --> 00:36:25.409
It's legal. Ask the IRS.

512
00:36:25.494 --> 00:36:28.704
They'll say the same thing.
But I feel stupid telling you this.

513
00:36:28.789 --> 00:36:31.082
I'm sure you would have
investigated the matter.

514
00:36:31.166 --> 00:36:35.252
Yeah, I don't need no banker to tell me
where the bears shit in the buckwheat.

515
00:36:35.337 --> 00:36:38.380
Of course not, but you do need someone
to set up the tax-free gift.

516
00:36:38.465 --> 00:36:40.341
It'll cost you. A lawyer.

517
00:36:40.425 --> 00:36:42.760
A bunch of ball-washing bastards.

518
00:36:42.844 --> 00:36:46.680
I suppose I could set it up for you.
That would save you some money.

519
00:36:46.681 --> 00:36:49.058
If you get the forms, I'll
prepare them for you.

520
00:36:49.142 --> 00:36:51.018
Nearly free of charge.

521
00:36:52.104 --> 00:36:55.481
I'd only ask three beers apiece
for each of my co-workers.

522
00:36:55.565 --> 00:36:57.983
Co-workers! Get him! That's rich, ain't it?

523
00:36:58.068 --> 00:37:01.529
I think a man working outdoors
feels more like a man

524
00:37:01.613 --> 00:37:03.364
if he can have a bottle of suds.

525
00:37:03.448 --> 00:37:06.492
That's only my opinion... sir.

526
00:37:09.913 --> 00:37:11.455
What are you jimmies staring at?

527
00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:12.540
Back to work!

528
00:37:12.624 --> 00:37:14.583
Let's go. Work.

529
00:37:23.475 --> 00:37:27.724
And that's how it came to pass...
that on the second-to-last day of the job,

530
00:37:28.225 --> 00:37:32.895
the convict crew that tarred the
plate-factory roof in the spring of '49...

531
00:37:32.979 --> 00:37:36.190
wound up sitting in a row
at ten o'clock in the morning,

532
00:37:36.274 --> 00:37:40.152
drinking icy-cold, Bohemia-style beer...

533
00:37:40.237 --> 00:37:45.449
courtesy of the hardest screw that ever
walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.

534
00:37:45.534 --> 00:37:47.618
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

535
00:37:48.995 --> 00:37:53.165
The colossal prick
even managed to sound magnanimous.

536
00:37:54.918 --> 00:37:59.547
We sat and drank with the sun on our
shoulders, and felt like free men.

537
00:37:59.631 --> 00:38:03.133
Hell, we could have been tarring the roof
of one of our own houses.

538
00:38:03.218 --> 00:38:06.512
We were the lords of all creation.

539
00:38:06.596 --> 00:38:11.141
As for Andy, he spent that
break hunkered in the shade...

540
00:38:11.226 --> 00:38:13.936
a strange little smile on his face,

541
00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:16.105
watching us drink his beer.

542
00:38:22.863 --> 00:38:24.405
Hey...

543
00:38:24.489 --> 00:38:25.781
Want a cold one, Andy?

544
00:38:25.866 --> 00:38:27.533
No, thanks.

545
00:38:27.617 --> 00:38:29.410
I gave up drinking.

546
00:38:33.248 --> 00:38:36.417
You could argue he'd done it to
curry favor with the guards.

547
00:38:36.501 --> 00:38:39.336
Or maybe make a few friends among us cons.

548
00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:45.050
Me, I think he did it just
to feel normal again.

549
00:38:46.136 --> 00:38:48.220
If only for a short while.

550
00:38:51.099 --> 00:38:53.434
King me.

551
00:38:53.518 --> 00:38:55.936
Chess. Now, there's a game of kings.

552
00:38:56.021 --> 00:38:58.564
- What?
- Civilized, strategic.

553
00:38:58.648 --> 00:39:00.983
And a total fucking mystery.

554
00:39:01.067 --> 00:39:02.276
I hate it.

555
00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.278
Maybe you'll let me teach you someday.

556
00:39:04.362 --> 00:39:06.822
Yeah. Sure.

557
00:39:06.907 --> 00:39:09.033
I thought of getting a board together.

558
00:39:09.117 --> 00:39:11.911
Well, I'm the right man.
I'm the guy that can get things.

559
00:39:11.995 --> 00:39:13.495
We might do business on a board.

560
00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:16.373
But I want to carve the pieces myself.

561
00:39:16.458 --> 00:39:20.044
One side in alabaster, the opposing side
in soapstone. What do you think?

562
00:39:20.128 --> 00:39:22.046
I think it'll take years.

563
00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:24.715
Well, years I got.
What I don't have are the rocks.

564
00:39:24.799 --> 00:39:26.967
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

565
00:39:27.052 --> 00:39:29.011
Pebbles, mostly.

566
00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:36.226
Andy, we're getting to be kinda friends,
aren't we?

567
00:39:36.311 --> 00:39:37.978
Yeah, I guess.

568
00:39:39.105 --> 00:39:41.523
Can I ask you something?

569
00:39:41.608 --> 00:39:43.609
Why did you do it?

570
00:39:44.819 --> 00:39:48.697
I'm innocent, Red. Just
like everybody else here.

571
00:39:52.994 --> 00:39:55.079
What are you in for?

572
00:39:57.082 --> 00:39:58.082
Murder.

573
00:39:58.166 --> 00:39:59.583
Same as you.

574
00:39:59.668 --> 00:40:00.834
Innocent?

575
00:40:03.505 --> 00:40:05.589
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

576
00:41:05.066 --> 00:41:06.650
Where's the canary?

577
00:41:06.735 --> 00:41:08.068
How did you know?

578
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:09.236
How did I know what?

579
00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.739
So, you don't know? Come.

580
00:41:14.492 --> 00:41:16.618
This is where the canary is, Johnny.

581
00:41:18.997 --> 00:41:23.000
Quite a surprise to hear a woman singing
in my house, eh, Johnny?

582
00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:28.297
That's quite a...

583
00:41:28.381 --> 00:41:30.049
surprise.

584
00:41:32.552 --> 00:41:34.261
Red...

585
00:41:34.345 --> 00:41:36.138
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

586
00:41:36.222 --> 00:41:38.057
Here she comes.

587
00:41:38.141 --> 00:41:41.018
This is the part I like -
when she does that shit with her hair.

588
00:41:41.102 --> 00:41:44.021
Yeah, I know. I've seen it
three times this month.

589
00:41:44.105 --> 00:41:46.106
Gilda, are you decent?

590
00:41:46.191 --> 00:41:48.233
Me?

591
00:41:49.944 --> 00:41:51.987
Hah! God, I love it!

592
00:41:57.869 --> 00:42:01.663
I understand
you're a man that knows how to get things.

593
00:42:01.748 --> 00:42:05.626
Yeah, I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time. What do you want?

594
00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:08.212
- Rita Hayworth.
- What?

595
00:42:08.296 --> 00:42:10.130
Can you get her?

596
00:42:11.216 --> 00:42:14.676
So, this is Johnny Farrell.
I've heard a lot about you, Johnny.

597
00:42:14.761 --> 00:42:16.637
Take a few weeks.

598
00:42:16.721 --> 00:42:17.930
Weeks?

599
00:42:17.931 --> 00:42:23.185
Well, yeah, Andy. I don't have her stuffed down the
front of my pants right now, I'm sorry to say.

600
00:42:23.269 --> 00:42:25.771
But I'll get her. Relax.

601
00:42:28.024 --> 00:42:29.525
Thanks.

602
00:42:29.609 --> 00:42:31.610
- It was a surprise, Mr. Farrell.
- It was.

603
00:42:31.694 --> 00:42:32.736
Sit down.

604
00:42:32.821 --> 00:42:34.738
Did you tell him what I'm doing here?

605
00:42:34.823 --> 00:42:37.658
No, I wanted to save
that as a surprise, too.

606
00:42:37.742 --> 00:42:39.409
Hang on to your hat, Mr. Farrell...

607
00:42:49.504 --> 00:42:51.755
- Take a walk.
- I gotta change the reel.

608
00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.924
I said fuck off!

609
00:42:58.763 --> 00:43:01.557
Ain't you gonna scream?

610
00:43:02.934 --> 00:43:04.726
Let's get this over with.

611
00:43:08.857 --> 00:43:10.482
He broke my fuckin' nose!

612
00:43:20.994 --> 00:43:25.038
Now... I'm gonna open my fly...

613
00:43:25.123 --> 00:43:28.083
and you're gonna swallow
what I give you to swallow.

614
00:43:29.169 --> 00:43:30.961
Then you're gonna swallow Rooster's.

615
00:43:31.045 --> 00:43:33.881
You broke his nose,
he ought to have something to show for it.

616
00:43:33.965 --> 00:43:36.175
Anything you put in my mouth,
you're gonna lose.

617
00:43:36.259 --> 00:43:39.011
No. You don't understand.

618
00:43:39.095 --> 00:43:42.389
You do that, and I'll put
all eight inches of this steel in your ear.

619
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:43.473
All right.

620
00:43:43.558 --> 00:43:48.187
But you should know that sudden, serious brain
injury causes the victim to bite down hard.

621
00:43:49.439 --> 00:43:51.857
In fact, I hear the bite
reflex is so strong,

622
00:43:51.941 --> 00:43:56.737
they have to pry the victim's jaws open...
with a crowbar.

623
00:43:59.574 --> 00:44:01.200
Where did you get this shit?

624
00:44:01.284 --> 00:44:02.951
I read it.

625
00:44:04.037 --> 00:44:06.914
Know how to read, you ignorant fuck?

626
00:44:08.416 --> 00:44:10.292
Honey...

627
00:44:11.544 --> 00:44:13.921
...you shouldn't.

628
00:44:15.965 --> 00:44:18.967
Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth...

629
00:44:19.052 --> 00:44:21.428
and neither did his friends.

630
00:44:21.512 --> 00:44:24.806
What they did do...
is beat him within an inch of his life.

631
00:44:26.017 --> 00:44:28.018
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

632
00:44:29.062 --> 00:44:31.563
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

633
00:44:36.027 --> 00:44:37.653
Time's up, Bogs.

634
00:44:41.324 --> 00:44:43.408
It's your world, boss.

635
00:44:45.495 --> 00:44:48.914
Return to your cell
blocks for evening count.

636
00:44:48.998 --> 00:44:51.166
All prisoners report for lockdown.

637
00:45:06.724 --> 00:45:08.016
What?

638
00:45:20.488 --> 00:45:23.198
- Where's he going?
- Grab his ankles.

639
00:45:24.784 --> 00:45:27.286
No! No!

640
00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:28.745
No!

641
00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:30.163
Help me...

642
00:45:30.248 --> 00:45:31.540
Aaarghh!

643
00:45:33.835 --> 00:45:36.503
Two things never happened again after that.

644
00:45:36.587 --> 00:45:39.423
The Sisters never laid a
finger on Andy again...

645
00:45:40.633 --> 00:45:43.343
...and Bogs never walked again.

646
00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:47.889
They transferred him
to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

647
00:45:47.974 --> 00:45:53.687
To my knowledge, he lived out the rest of
his days drinking his food through a straw.

648
00:45:53.771 --> 00:45:58.442
I'm thinking Andy could use a nice welcome
back when he gets out of the infirmary.

649
00:45:59.569 --> 00:46:03.363
Sounds good to us.
I figure we owe him that much for the beer.

650
00:46:04.741 --> 00:46:07.409
The man likes to play chess.

651
00:46:07.493 --> 00:46:09.578
Let's get him some rocks.

652
00:46:41.986 --> 00:46:43.862
Guys...

653
00:46:43.946 --> 00:46:46.323
I got one. I got one. Look.

654
00:46:48.743 --> 00:46:50.827
Heywood, that isn't soapstone.

655
00:46:50.912 --> 00:46:53.121
And it ain't alabaster, either.

656
00:46:53.206 --> 00:46:54.831
What are you, a fucking geologist?

657
00:46:54.916 --> 00:46:56.958
He's right. It ain't.

658
00:46:57.043 --> 00:46:58.293
Well, what the hell is it?

659
00:46:58.378 --> 00:47:00.921
A horse apple.

660
00:47:01.005 --> 00:47:04.132
- Bullshit.
- No, horse shit. Petrified.

661
00:47:10.515 --> 00:47:13.392
Oh, Jesus Christ!

662
00:47:13.476 --> 00:47:15.435
Oh, damn!

663
00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:19.481
Despite a few hitches,
the boys came through in fine style.

664
00:47:20.691 --> 00:47:23.318
And by the weekend he was due back,
we had enough rocks

665
00:47:23.403 --> 00:47:26.446
to keep him busy till rapture.

666
00:47:26.531 --> 00:47:29.241
I also got a big shipment in that week.

667
00:47:29.325 --> 00:47:31.868
Cigarettes. Chewing gum.

668
00:47:31.953 --> 00:47:33.453
Sipping whisky.

669
00:47:33.538 --> 00:47:37.082
Playing cards with naked ladies on them.
You name it.

670
00:47:37.166 --> 00:47:40.127
And of course, the most important item.

671
00:47:41.879 --> 00:47:43.964
Rita Hayworth herself.

672
00:48:18.125 --> 00:48:20.960
OK, look alive! Open all tiers.

673
00:48:21.044 --> 00:48:23.379
Heads up. They're tossing the cells.

674
00:48:23.464 --> 00:48:25.715
Heads up. They're tossing the cells.

675
00:48:27.843 --> 00:48:29.719
119.

676
00:48:31.221 --> 00:48:32.889
123.

677
00:48:42.357 --> 00:48:44.233
On your feet.

678
00:48:45.944 --> 00:48:47.820
Face the wall.

679
00:49:22.314 --> 00:49:24.398
Turn around and face the Warden.

680
00:49:30.113 --> 00:49:32.198
Pleased to see you reading this.

681
00:49:33.575 --> 00:49:35.621
Any favorite passages?

682
00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:41.249
"Watch ye, therefore, for ye know not
when the master of the house cometh."

683
00:49:42.293 --> 00:49:45.170
Mark 13:35.

684
00:49:45.254 --> 00:49:47.922
I always liked that one.

685
00:49:48.007 --> 00:49:49.507
But I prefer...

686
00:49:49.592 --> 00:49:52.343
"I'm the light of the world.

687
00:49:52.428 --> 00:49:55.972
He that followeth me shall not walk in
darkness, but shall have the light of life."

688
00:49:56.056 --> 00:49:58.641
John, Chapter 8, Verse 12.

689
00:49:58.726 --> 00:50:02.187
I hear you're good with numbers. How nice.

690
00:50:03.314 --> 00:50:05.398
A man should have a skill.

691
00:50:07.485 --> 00:50:08.943
Wanna explain this?

692
00:50:10.029 --> 00:50:13.490
It's called a rock blanket.
It's for shaping and polishing rocks.

693
00:50:14.533 --> 00:50:16.493
A little hobby of mine.

694
00:50:27.338 --> 00:50:30.340
It's pretty clean. Some contraband here,

695
00:50:30.424 --> 00:50:32.509
but nothing to get in a twist over.

696
00:50:36.347 --> 00:50:38.431
I can't say I approve of this.

697
00:50:39.934 --> 00:50:41.643
But I suppose...

698
00:50:43.604 --> 00:50:45.480
...exceptions can be made.

699
00:50:55.866 --> 00:50:58.159
Lock 'em up!

700
00:51:00.162 --> 00:51:02.121
I almost forgot.

701
00:51:02.206 --> 00:51:04.457
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

702
00:51:04.542 --> 00:51:06.000
Salvation lies within.

703
00:51:07.086 --> 00:51:08.419
Yes, sir.

704
00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:19.305
Tossing cells was just an excuse.

705
00:51:19.849 --> 00:51:23.434
The truth is, Norton
wanted to size Andy up.

706
00:51:37.074 --> 00:51:40.201
My wife made that in church group.

707
00:51:42.538 --> 00:51:43.872
Very nice, sir.

708
00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:46.916
Do you enjoy working in the laundry?

709
00:51:48.544 --> 00:51:50.253
No, sir, not especially.

710
00:51:50.337 --> 00:51:53.131
Perhaps we can find something more...

711
00:51:53.215 --> 00:51:55.300
befitting a man of your education.

712
00:52:03.931 --> 00:52:05.599
Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?

713
00:52:05.683 --> 00:52:06.975
Andy.

714
00:52:07.059 --> 00:52:09.352
I thought I heard you out here!

715
00:52:10.355 --> 00:52:11.939
I've been reassigned to you.

716
00:52:12.023 --> 00:52:15.192
I know. They told me.

717
00:52:15.276 --> 00:52:17.361
Ain't that a kick in the head?

718
00:52:17.445 --> 00:52:19.947
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

719
00:52:20.031 --> 00:52:22.116
Come on.

720
00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:24.368
Well, here she is.

721
00:52:24.452 --> 00:52:26.995
Shawshank Prison library.

722
00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:29.957
National Geographics.

723
00:52:30.041 --> 00:52:32.876
Reader's Digest condensed books.

724
00:52:32.961 --> 00:52:35.254
Louis L'Amour.

725
00:52:35.255 --> 00:52:37.381
Look Magazine.

726
00:52:37.465 --> 00:52:39.967
Erle Stanley Gardners.

727
00:52:40.051 --> 00:52:43.595
Every evening,
I load up the cart and make my round.

728
00:52:43.596 --> 00:52:46.765
I enter the names on this clipboard here.

729
00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:50.310
Easy-peasy, Japanesey. Any questions?

730
00:52:50.395 --> 00:52:53.355
Brooks, how long have you been librarian?

731
00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:58.610
Oh... I come here in '05,
and they made me librarian in 1912.

732
00:52:58.695 --> 00:53:02.072
And in all that time,
have you ever had an assistant?

733
00:53:02.157 --> 00:53:04.742
No. No, not much to it, really.

734
00:53:04.826 --> 00:53:06.744
Well, why me? Why now?

735
00:53:06.828 --> 00:53:08.328
I don't know,

736
00:53:08.413 --> 00:53:11.749
but it'll be nice to have some company
down here for a change.

737
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:13.834
Dufresne!

738
00:53:23.136 --> 00:53:25.220
That's him. That's the one.

739
00:53:32.771 --> 00:53:34.062
I'm Dekins.

740
00:53:34.147 --> 00:53:36.607
I was er...

741
00:53:36.691 --> 00:53:40.694
thinking about maybe setting up some kind
of trust fund for my kids' educations.

742
00:53:43.031 --> 00:53:44.490
Oh...

743
00:53:44.574 --> 00:53:46.241
I see.

744
00:53:47.702 --> 00:53:49.578
Well, erm...

745
00:53:50.955 --> 00:53:52.498
...why don't we have a seat,

746
00:53:52.582 --> 00:53:54.666
and talk it over?

747
00:53:57.212 --> 00:54:00.130
Brooks,
do you have a piece of paper and a pencil?

748
00:54:11.601 --> 00:54:13.310
Thanks.

749
00:54:13.394 --> 00:54:15.062
So...

750
00:54:16.314 --> 00:54:18.816
Mr. Dekins...

751
00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:23.362
And then Andy says to Mr. Dekins,
"Do you want your sons to go to Harvard,

752
00:54:23.446 --> 00:54:25.572
- "or Yale?"
- He didn't say that?

753
00:54:25.657 --> 00:54:28.325
As God is my witness, he did!

754
00:54:28.409 --> 00:54:31.787
Dekins just blinked for a second.
Then he laughed himself silly.

755
00:54:31.871 --> 00:54:33.747
And afterwards he shook Andy's hand.

756
00:54:33.832 --> 00:54:35.207
My ass!

757
00:54:35.291 --> 00:54:36.500
Shook his hand.

758
00:54:36.584 --> 00:54:39.545
Hell, I... I near soiled myself!

759
00:54:39.629 --> 00:54:43.841
All Andy needed was a suit and a tie
and a little jiggly hula girl on his desk,

760
00:54:43.925 --> 00:54:45.259
and he would have been:

761
00:54:45.343 --> 00:54:46.885
"Mr. Dufresne, if you please"!

762
00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:48.720
Making a few friends, Andy?

763
00:54:49.764 --> 00:54:51.723
I wouldn't say "friends".

764
00:54:51.808 --> 00:54:55.811
I'm a convicted murderer
who provides sound financial planning.

765
00:54:55.895 --> 00:54:58.230
It's a wonderful pet to have.

766
00:54:58.314 --> 00:55:00.232
Got you out of the laundry, though.

767
00:55:00.316 --> 00:55:02.526
Well, it might do more than that.

768
00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:05.612
How about expanding the library?
Get some new books in there.

769
00:55:05.697 --> 00:55:08.407
If you're gonna ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

770
00:55:08.491 --> 00:55:10.951
- Right.
- How do you expect to do that?

771
00:55:11.035 --> 00:55:16.290
I mean, get new books in here,
Mr. Dufresne, if you please?

772
00:55:16.374 --> 00:55:18.125
Ask the Warden for funds.

773
00:55:19.544 --> 00:55:22.838
Son, son. Six wardens
have been through here in my tenure,

774
00:55:22.922 --> 00:55:26.550
and I've learned one
immutable, universal truth.

775
00:55:26.634 --> 00:55:28.343
Not one of them born...

776
00:55:28.344 --> 00:55:33.307
whose asshole wouldn't pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you asked them for funds.

777
00:55:33.433 --> 00:55:35.726
The budget's stretched thin, as it is.

778
00:55:35.810 --> 00:55:37.061
I see.

779
00:55:37.145 --> 00:55:40.689
Perhaps I could write to the State Senate
and request funds from them.

780
00:55:40.774 --> 00:55:45.152
As far as they're concerned, there's only three
ways to spend money when it comes to prisons:

781
00:55:45.236 --> 00:55:47.321
more walls, more bars and more guards.

782
00:55:47.405 --> 00:55:51.825
Still, I'd like to try, with your permission. A
letter a week. They can't ignore me forever.

783
00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:53.452
Sure can.

784
00:55:53.536 --> 00:55:56.413
But you write your letters,
if it makes you happy.

785
00:55:56.498 --> 00:55:58.791
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?

786
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:03.754
So, Andy started writing a letter a week,

787
00:56:03.838 --> 00:56:05.923
just like he said.

788
00:56:09.970 --> 00:56:14.098
And, just like Norton said,
Andy got no answers.

789
00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:27.444
The following April, Andy did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.

790
00:56:27.529 --> 00:56:30.614
The year after that, he did them all...

791
00:56:30.699 --> 00:56:32.783
including the Warden's.

792
00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:37.913
The year after that, they rescheduled
the start of the intramural season

793
00:56:37.998 --> 00:56:40.082
to coincide with tax season.

794
00:56:42.377 --> 00:56:46.588
The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.

795
00:56:46.673 --> 00:56:50.801
So, Moresby Prison issued you your gun,
but you had to pay for it?

796
00:56:50.885 --> 00:56:52.636
Damn right. The holster, too.

797
00:56:52.721 --> 00:56:53.971
That's tax-deductible.

798
00:56:54.055 --> 00:56:55.222
You can write that off.

799
00:56:55.306 --> 00:56:58.642
Yes, sir.
Andy was a regular cottage industry.

800
00:56:58.727 --> 00:57:01.770
In fact, it got so busy at tax time...

801
00:57:01.855 --> 00:57:03.897
he was allowed a staff.

802
00:57:03.982 --> 00:57:06.442
Hey, Red, can you hand me a stack of 1040s?

803
00:57:06.526 --> 00:57:09.194
It got me out of the wood shop
a month out of the year,

804
00:57:09.279 --> 00:57:11.947
and that was fine by me.

805
00:57:12.032 --> 00:57:15.409
And still... he kept sending those letters.

806
00:57:20.707 --> 00:57:22.541
Red, Andy.

807
00:57:22.625 --> 00:57:23.834
It's Brooks.

808
00:57:23.918 --> 00:57:26.378
Watch the door.

809
00:57:26.463 --> 00:57:28.047
Please, Brooks.

810
00:57:28.131 --> 00:57:30.132
- Just calm the fuck down.
- Stay back!

811
00:57:30.216 --> 00:57:32.259
- Stay back!
- What the hell's going on?

812
00:57:32.343 --> 00:57:35.429
You tell me. One second he's fine.
Then out comes the knife.

813
00:57:35.513 --> 00:57:37.973
Brooks, we can talk about this. Right?

814
00:57:38.058 --> 00:57:40.184
Nothing to talk about, goddamn it!

815
00:57:40.268 --> 00:57:41.977
I'm gonna cut his fucking throat.

816
00:57:42.062 --> 00:57:43.937
Heywood? Wait, what's he done to you?

817
00:57:44.022 --> 00:57:46.148
It's what they done!

818
00:57:46.232 --> 00:57:47.649
I... I got no choice...

819
00:57:47.734 --> 00:57:50.402
You're not gonna hurt him.
Even Heywood knows that.

820
00:57:50.487 --> 00:57:53.113
- Right, Heywood?
- I... I know that, sure.

821
00:57:53.198 --> 00:57:56.617
You won't hurt him, because he's a friend,
and you're a reasonable man.

822
00:57:56.701 --> 00:57:57.993
That's right. Right, guys?

823
00:57:58.078 --> 00:58:01.455
- Yes.
- So, put the knife down. Brooks, look at me.

824
00:58:01.539 --> 00:58:03.373
Put the knife down.

825
00:58:04.459 --> 00:58:05.626
Brooks...

826
00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:07.961
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

827
00:58:08.046 --> 00:58:10.380
Brooks, look at his neck. It's bleeding.

828
00:58:11.716 --> 00:58:13.300
It's the only...

829
00:58:13.384 --> 00:58:15.677
It's the only way they'd let me stay.

830
00:58:15.762 --> 00:58:18.347
Come on. This is crazy.
You don't want to do this.

831
00:58:18.348 --> 00:58:20.432
Put it down.

832
00:58:27.816 --> 00:58:32.528
Come on. Take it easy.
You're going to be all right.

833
00:58:32.612 --> 00:58:33.987
Him?

834
00:58:34.072 --> 00:58:37.741
Hell, what about me?
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat.

835
00:58:37.826 --> 00:58:40.452
Shit, Heywood,
you've had worse from shaving.

836
00:58:40.537 --> 00:58:42.788
What the hell did you do
to set him off, anyway?

837
00:58:42.872 --> 00:58:45.207
Nothing. I come in here
to say fare-thee-well.

838
00:58:45.879 --> 00:58:49.006
Ain't you heard? His parole's come through.

839
00:58:50.797 --> 00:58:53.924
I just don't understand what
happened in there. That's all.

840
00:58:54.009 --> 00:58:56.594
The old man's as crazy
as a rat in a tin shithouse.

841
00:58:56.678 --> 00:58:58.888
Oh, Heywood, that's enough out of you.

842
00:58:58.972 --> 00:59:01.974
- I heard he had you shitting in your pants.
- Fuck you!

843
00:59:02.058 --> 00:59:03.434
Would you knock it off?

844
00:59:03.518 --> 00:59:05.853
Brooks ain't no bug.

845
00:59:05.937 --> 00:59:07.813
He's just...

846
00:59:09.691 --> 00:59:11.525
He's just institutionalized.

847
00:59:12.861 --> 00:59:14.528
Institutionalized, my ass.

848
00:59:14.613 --> 00:59:18.908
The man's been in here 50 years, Heywood.
50 years.

849
00:59:18.992 --> 00:59:20.701
This is all he knows.

850
00:59:20.785 --> 00:59:23.204
In here, he's an important man.

851
00:59:23.288 --> 00:59:24.747
He's an educated man.

852
00:59:24.831 --> 00:59:26.916
Outside, he's nothing.

853
00:59:29.085 --> 00:59:31.712
Just a used-up con with
arthritis in both hands.

854
00:59:31.796 --> 00:59:35.007
Probably couldn't get a
library card if he tried.

855
00:59:35.091 --> 00:59:37.176
You know what I'm trying to say?

856
00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:40.012
Red, I do believe you're
talking out of your ass.

857
00:59:41.264 --> 00:59:44.183
You believe whatever you want, Floyd.

858
00:59:44.184 --> 00:59:46.727
But I'm telling you, these walls are funny.

859
00:59:48.146 --> 00:59:50.231
First you hate 'em...

860
00:59:51.775 --> 00:59:53.859
...then you get used to 'em.

861
00:59:55.487 --> 00:59:58.113
Enough time passes...

862
00:59:58.198 --> 01:00:01.158
you get so you depend on 'em.

863
01:00:01.243 --> 01:00:03.577
That's institutionalized.

864
01:00:03.662 --> 01:00:05.037
Shit.

865
01:00:05.038 --> 01:00:06.664
You can never get like that.

866
01:00:06.748 --> 01:00:08.666
Oh, yeah?

867
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:11.335
Say that when you've been here
as long as Brooks has.

868
01:00:11.419 --> 01:00:13.295
Goddamn right.

869
01:00:15.632 --> 01:00:18.175
They send you here for life.

870
01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:20.344
That's exactly what they take.

871
01:00:22.264 --> 01:00:24.348
The part that counts, anyway.

872
01:00:31.856 --> 01:00:34.024
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

873
01:00:35.944 --> 01:00:37.778
You go on, now.

874
01:00:38.863 --> 01:00:43.534
You're free.

875
01:00:59.426 --> 01:01:01.302
Bye.

876
01:01:01.932 --> 01:01:03.850
Good luck, Brooks.

877
01:01:40.429 --> 01:01:43.139
Dear fellas...

878
01:01:43.223 --> 01:01:47.435
I can't believe
how fast things move on the outside.

879
01:01:48.854 --> 01:01:51.898
Watch it, old-timer! Are
you trying to get killed?

880
01:01:51.982 --> 01:01:55.318
I saw an automobile once, when I was a kid,

881
01:01:55.402 --> 01:01:58.321
but now... they're everywhere.

882
01:02:02.534 --> 01:02:06.120
The world went and got itself
in a big damn hurry.

883
01:02:22.471 --> 01:02:28.768
The parole board got me into
this halfway house called The Brewer,

884
01:02:28.852 --> 01:02:32.647
and a job bagging groceries at the Foodway.

885
01:02:34.691 --> 01:02:40.029
It's hard work, and I try to keep up,
but my hands hurt most of the time.

886
01:02:40.113 --> 01:02:42.114
Make sure your man double-bags.

887
01:02:42.199 --> 01:02:44.450
Last time, the bottom near came out.

888
01:02:44.534 --> 01:02:47.828
Make sure you double-bag, like
the lady says. Understand?

889
01:02:47.913 --> 01:02:49.372
Yes, sir. I surely will.

890
01:02:49.456 --> 01:02:53.251
I don't think
the store manager likes me very much.

891
01:02:56.213 --> 01:03:01.008
Sometimes, after work,
I go to the park and feed the birds.

892
01:03:01.093 --> 01:03:06.430
I keep thinking Jake might just show up
and say hello.

893
01:03:06.515 --> 01:03:08.307
But he never does.

894
01:03:09.393 --> 01:03:14.772
And I hope, wherever he is,
he's doing OK and making new friends.

895
01:03:18.277 --> 01:03:21.195
I have trouble sleeping at night.

896
01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:24.073
I have bad dreams, like I'm falling.

897
01:03:25.158 --> 01:03:27.076
I wake up, scared.

898
01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:31.163
Sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where I am.

899
01:03:32.791 --> 01:03:34.250
Maybe I should get me a gun

900
01:03:34.334 --> 01:03:38.212
and rob the Foodway, so
they'd send me home.

901
01:03:38.297 --> 01:03:40.631
I could shoot the manager,
while I was at it.

902
01:03:40.716 --> 01:03:42.675
Sort of like a bonus.

903
01:03:44.177 --> 01:03:48.431
I guess I'm too old for that
sort of nonsense any more.

904
01:03:48.515 --> 01:03:50.558
I don't like it here.

905
01:03:50.642 --> 01:03:53.311
I'm tired of being afraid all the time.

906
01:03:53.395 --> 01:03:56.897
I've decided... not to stay.

907
01:04:07.742 --> 01:04:11.245
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss.

908
01:04:11.329 --> 01:04:13.414
Not for an old crook like me.

909
01:05:16.809 --> 01:05:20.854
"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss.
Not for an old crook like me."

910
01:05:22.022 --> 01:05:26.067
PS. Tell Heywood
I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat.

911
01:05:26.068 --> 01:05:28.153
"No hard feelings. Brooks."

912
01:05:38.873 --> 01:05:40.957
He should have died in here.

913
01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:50.842
What the fuck have you done?
It's a goddamn mess. I'll tell you that.

914
01:05:55.556 --> 01:05:56.973
What's all this?

915
01:05:57.057 --> 01:06:00.935
You tell me, fuck-stick.
They're all addressed to you.

916
01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:02.312
Take it.

917
01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.864
"Dear Mr. Dufresne..."

918
01:06:13.949 --> 01:06:15.950
In response to your repeated enquiries,

919
01:06:16.035 --> 01:06:20.747
"the State has allocated the enclosed funds
for your library project."

920
01:06:20.831 --> 01:06:22.207
This is 200 dollars.

921
01:06:23.250 --> 01:06:27.170
"In addition, the Library District
has generously responded"

922
01:06:27.254 --> 01:06:29.964
with a charitable donation
of used books and sundries.

923
01:06:30.049 --> 01:06:32.133
We trust this will fill your needs.

924
01:06:32.218 --> 01:06:36.346
"We now consider the matter closed.
Please stop sending us letters."

925
01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:39.265
I want all this cleared out
before the Warden gets back.

926
01:06:39.350 --> 01:06:41.017
Yes, sir.

927
01:06:44.772 --> 01:06:46.147
Good for you, Andy.

928
01:06:48.776 --> 01:06:50.235
Wow!

929
01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:53.404
It only took six years.

930
01:06:54.698 --> 01:06:57.575
From now on, I'll write two
letters a week, instead of one.

931
01:06:57.660 --> 01:07:01.204
Oh, I believe you're crazy enough.
You'd better get all this stuff out,

932
01:07:01.288 --> 01:07:02.455
like the Captain said.

933
01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:06.417
Now, I'm gonna go pinch a loaf.
When I come back, this is all gone, right?

934
01:07:12.591 --> 01:07:14.592
Wow.

935
01:07:48.336 --> 01:07:50.921
♪ Sull'aria...

936
01:07:54.550 --> 01:07:56.176
Andy, do you hear that?

937
01:07:57.053 --> 01:08:00.764
♪ ..Zeffiretto

938
01:08:12.985 --> 01:08:20.826

942
01:09:04.787 --> 01:09:07.664
Dufresne?

943
01:09:07.748 --> 01:09:09.332
Dufresne?

944
01:09:09.417 --> 01:09:11.501
Andy, let me out.

945
01:09:13.713 --> 01:09:17.257
Andy?

946
01:09:17.342 --> 01:09:22.513
I have no idea to this day what those
two Italian ladies were singing about.

947
01:09:22.597 --> 01:09:25.015
The truth is, I don't want to know.

948
01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:27.184
Some things are best left unsaid.

949
01:09:31.231 --> 01:09:36.276
I like to think they were singing about something
so beautiful, it can't be expressed in words...

950
01:09:36.361 --> 01:09:38.737
and makes your heart ache because of it.

951
01:09:40.949 --> 01:09:43.659
I tell you, those voices soared...

952
01:09:43.743 --> 01:09:48.288
higher and farther than anybody
in a grey place dares to dream.

953
01:09:48.373 --> 01:09:51.750
It was like some beautiful bird
flapped into our drab little cage

954
01:09:51.835 --> 01:09:54.962
and made those walls dissolve away.

955
01:09:55.046 --> 01:09:57.381
And for the briefest of moments...

956
01:09:57.465 --> 01:10:00.551
every last man at Shawshank felt free.

957
01:10:03.054 --> 01:10:05.556
It pissed the Warden off something awful.

958
01:10:06.975 --> 01:10:08.100
Open the door.

959
01:10:10.854 --> 01:10:12.771
Open it up!

960
01:10:13.982 --> 01:10:16.358
Dufresne, open this door!

961
01:10:17.986 --> 01:10:19.319
Turn that off!

962
01:10:26.119 --> 01:10:28.871
I am warning you, Dufresne. Turn that off!

963
01:10:42.719 --> 01:10:44.595
Dufresne...

964
01:10:45.722 --> 01:10:47.806
You're mine now.

965
01:10:55.356 --> 01:10:58.108
Andy got two weeks in the hole
for that little stunt.

966
01:10:58.193 --> 01:11:00.611
On your feet!

967
01:11:01.821 --> 01:11:03.906
- Hey, look who's here.
- Maestro!

968
01:11:05.408 --> 01:11:09.453
Y-Y-You couldn't play something good, huh?
Hank Williams or something?

969
01:11:09.537 --> 01:11:12.206
They broke the door down
before I could take requests.

970
01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:14.083
Was it worth it, two weeks in the hole?

971
01:11:14.167 --> 01:11:15.417
Easiest time I ever did.

972
01:11:15.502 --> 01:11:18.545
Bullshit! There's no such thing
as easy time in the hole.

973
01:11:18.546 --> 01:11:21.173
A week in the hole is like a year.

974
01:11:21.257 --> 01:11:23.967
I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

975
01:11:24.052 --> 01:11:27.387
So, they let you tote that record player
down there, huh?

976
01:11:29.516 --> 01:11:31.141
It was in here.

977
01:11:31.226 --> 01:11:32.893
And in here.

978
01:11:34.104 --> 01:11:38.357
That's the beauty of music.
They can't get that from you.

979
01:11:42.278 --> 01:11:44.780
Haven't you ever felt that way about music?

980
01:11:46.449 --> 01:11:50.536
Well, I played a mean harmonica,
as a younger man.

981
01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:52.412
Lost interest in it, though.

982
01:11:52.497 --> 01:11:54.331
Didn't make much sense in here.

983
01:11:54.415 --> 01:11:56.875
Here's where it makes the most sense.

984
01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:59.545
You need it, so you don't forget.

985
01:11:59.629 --> 01:12:00.963
Forget?

986
01:12:01.047 --> 01:12:03.006
Forget that...

987
01:12:03.091 --> 01:12:05.175
there are places...

988
01:12:06.511 --> 01:12:09.054
...in the world that aren't
made out of stone...

989
01:12:09.139 --> 01:12:11.181
that there's a...

990
01:12:11.266 --> 01:12:13.100
there's something...

991
01:12:13.184 --> 01:12:15.978
inside that they can't get to...

992
01:12:16.062 --> 01:12:18.355
that they can't touch.

993
01:12:18.439 --> 01:12:20.315
It's yours.

994
01:12:21.734 --> 01:12:23.443
What are you talking about?

995
01:12:24.529 --> 01:12:26.113
Hope.

996
01:12:26.197 --> 01:12:28.073
Hope?

997
01:12:29.909 --> 01:12:32.578
Let me tell you something, my friend.

998
01:12:32.662 --> 01:12:34.621
Hope is a dangerous thing.

999
01:12:36.207 --> 01:12:38.250
Hope can drive a man insane.

1000
01:12:39.294 --> 01:12:41.211
It's got no use on the inside.

1001
01:12:41.296 --> 01:12:43.964
You'd better get used to that idea.

1002
01:12:46.384 --> 01:12:48.010
Like Brooks did?

1003
01:13:13.244 --> 01:13:14.286
Sit down.

1004
01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:22.961
It says here that you've served
30 years of a life sentence.

1005
01:13:23.046 --> 01:13:25.672
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

1006
01:13:25.757 --> 01:13:27.841
Oh, yes, sir.

1007
01:13:27.842 --> 01:13:29.927
Without a doubt.

1008
01:13:30.970 --> 01:13:33.305
And I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

1009
01:13:35.892 --> 01:13:37.935
No danger to society here.

1010
01:13:38.019 --> 01:13:40.103
God's honest truth.

1011
01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:44.524
Absolutely rehabilitated.

1012
01:13:54.452 --> 01:13:56.536
30 years.

1013
01:13:57.622 --> 01:13:59.665
Jesus, when they say it like that...

1014
01:13:59.749 --> 01:14:01.833
You wonder where it went.

1015
01:14:04.796 --> 01:14:06.880
I wonder where ten years went.

1016
01:14:11.928 --> 01:14:13.220
Here.

1017
01:14:13.304 --> 01:14:15.472
Little parole rejection present.

1018
01:14:17.308 --> 01:14:19.351
Go ahead and open it.

1019
01:14:19.435 --> 01:14:23.230
I had to go through one of your
competitors. I hope you don't mind.

1020
01:14:23.314 --> 01:14:25.399
I wanted it to be a surprise.

1021
01:14:35.535 --> 01:14:37.619
It's very pretty, Andy.

1022
01:14:38.705 --> 01:14:40.789
Thank you.

1023
01:14:42.542 --> 01:14:44.626
Are you going to play it?

1024
01:14:48.756 --> 01:14:50.841
No.

1025
01:14:53.470 --> 01:14:55.554
Not right now.

1026
01:15:02.812 --> 01:15:04.897
Tier 3 South. Clear.

1027
01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:07.983
Tier 4 North. Clear.

1028
01:15:08.068 --> 01:15:10.152
Tier 1 South. Clear.

1029
01:15:12.730 --> 01:15:14.815
Fall in!

1030
01:15:49.382 --> 01:15:50.966
Lights out!

1031
01:16:25.877 --> 01:16:27.919
Andy was as good as his word.

1032
01:16:28.004 --> 01:16:30.505
He wrote two letters a week instead of one.

1033
01:16:33.134 --> 01:16:37.262
In 1959, the State Senate
finally clued into the fact

1034
01:16:37.346 --> 01:16:40.223
they couldn't buy him off
with just a $200 check.

1035
01:16:40.308 --> 01:16:46.897
Appropriations Committee voted an annual
payment of $500 just to shut him up.

1036
01:16:46.981 --> 01:16:48.690
And you'd be amazed

1037
01:16:48.774 --> 01:16:50.442
how far Andy could stretch it.

1038
01:16:50.526 --> 01:16:53.403
He made deals with book
clubs, charity groups.

1039
01:16:53.488 --> 01:16:55.864
He bought remaindered books by the pound.

1040
01:16:55.948 --> 01:16:58.158
Treasure Island.

1041
01:16:58.242 --> 01:17:00.410
Robert Louis...

1042
01:17:00.495 --> 01:17:01.703
...Stevenson.

1043
01:17:01.787 --> 01:17:03.246
Fiction, adventure.

1044
01:17:05.249 --> 01:17:06.875
What's next?

1045
01:17:06.876 --> 01:17:09.586
I got here Auto Repair and...

1046
01:17:10.630 --> 01:17:11.963
...Soap Carving.

1047
01:17:12.048 --> 01:17:15.425
Trade skills and hobbies. Goes under
Educational. The stack behind you.

1048
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:17.552
The Count Of Monte Crisco.

1049
01:17:17.637 --> 01:17:19.971
That's Cristo, you dumb shit.

1050
01:17:20.056 --> 01:17:23.850
By Alexandree... Dumass.

1051
01:17:23.935 --> 01:17:28.855
Dumb-ass?

1052
01:17:31.359 --> 01:17:33.693
Dumas. You know what that's about?

1053
01:17:33.778 --> 01:17:35.153
Uh-uh.

1054
01:17:35.664 --> 01:17:38.374
You'll like it. It's about a prison break.

1055
01:17:38.458 --> 01:17:42.461
We ought to file that under
Educational, too, oughtn't we?

1056
01:17:43.016 --> 01:17:46.516
The rest of us did our best to pitch in
when and where we could.

1057
01:17:47.517 --> 01:17:49.351
By the year Kennedy was shot,

1058
01:17:49.435 --> 01:17:53.772
Andy had transformed a storage room
smelling of rat turds and turpentine

1059
01:17:53.773 --> 01:17:57.108
into the best prison
library in New England,

1060
01:17:57.193 --> 01:18:01.071
complete with a fine
selection of Hank Williams.

1061
01:18:01.155 --> 01:18:05.325
♪ Lawd I don't know what I'll do-ooo

1062
01:18:05.409 --> 01:18:08.161
♪ All I do is sit and sigh...

1063
01:18:08.246 --> 01:18:12.999
That was also the year Warden Norton
instituted his famous Inside Out program.

1064
01:18:13.917 --> 01:18:15.668
You may remember reading about it.

1065
01:18:16.167 --> 01:18:19.586
It made all the papers
and got his picture in Look Magazine.

1066
01:18:19.671 --> 01:18:21.338
No free ride.

1067
01:18:21.422 --> 01:18:24.383
But rather a genuine, progressive advance

1068
01:18:24.467 --> 01:18:26.635
in corrections and rehabilitation.

1069
01:18:27.679 --> 01:18:30.013
Our inmates, properly supervised,

1070
01:18:30.098 --> 01:18:32.850
will be put to work outside these walls,

1071
01:18:32.934 --> 01:18:35.018
performing all manner of public service.

1072
01:18:35.103 --> 01:18:39.022
These men can learn
the value of an honest day's labor,

1073
01:18:39.107 --> 01:18:42.776
while providing a valuable service
to the community and...

1074
01:18:42.861 --> 01:18:48.073
at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr. and Mrs. John Q Taxpayer.

1075
01:18:48.157 --> 01:18:50.826
Of course,
Norton failed to mention to the press

1076
01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:54.204
that "bare minimum of expense"
is a fairly loose term.

1077
01:18:54.289 --> 01:18:57.457
There are a hundred different ways
to skim off the top.

1078
01:18:57.542 --> 01:19:00.168
Men, materials, you name it.

1079
01:19:01.212 --> 01:19:03.964
And, oh, my Lord, how the money rolled in.

1080
01:19:04.048 --> 01:19:06.174
If this keeps up, you'll
put me out of business.

1081
01:19:06.259 --> 01:19:08.427
- Ned!
- This pool of slave labor you've got,

1082
01:19:08.511 --> 01:19:10.554
you can underbid any contractor in town.

1083
01:19:10.638 --> 01:19:14.600
Ned, we're providing
a valuable community service here.

1084
01:19:14.684 --> 01:19:16.935
Well, that's fine for the papers

1085
01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:18.520
but I've got a family to feed.

1086
01:19:18.605 --> 01:19:20.314
Sam...

1087
01:19:20.398 --> 01:19:22.858
Sam, we go back a long way.

1088
01:19:22.942 --> 01:19:25.277
I need this new highway contract.

1089
01:19:25.361 --> 01:19:27.571
I don't get it, and I go under.

1090
01:19:27.655 --> 01:19:29.698
That's a fact.

1091
01:19:29.782 --> 01:19:31.867
You just have some of this fine pie

1092
01:19:31.951 --> 01:19:33.994
my missus made especially for you,

1093
01:19:34.078 --> 01:19:35.412
and you think about that.

1094
01:19:43.463 --> 01:19:46.381
Ned, I wouldn't worry too much
about this contract.

1095
01:19:46.466 --> 01:19:49.676
It seems to me I already got
my boys committed elsewhere.

1096
01:19:51.554 --> 01:19:54.139
You be sure and thank
Maisie for this fine pie.

1097
01:19:55.767 --> 01:19:57.935
And behind every shady deal,

1098
01:19:58.019 --> 01:20:00.228
behind every dollar earned,

1099
01:20:00.313 --> 01:20:03.482
there was Andy, keeping the books.

1100
01:20:04.525 --> 01:20:07.945
Two deposits.
Maine National and New England First.

1101
01:20:08.029 --> 01:20:10.113
Night drops as always, sir.

1102
01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:42.270
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1103
01:20:42.355 --> 01:20:45.148
- Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.
- Yes, sir.

1104
01:20:45.233 --> 01:20:48.986
Tell them if they over-starch my shirts
again, they'll hear about it from me.

1105
01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:51.071
How do I look?

1106
01:20:51.155 --> 01:20:53.865
- Very nice, sir.
- Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1107
01:20:53.950 --> 01:20:55.659
The Governor's going to be there.

1108
01:20:57.078 --> 01:20:59.121
Want the rest of this?

1109
01:20:59.205 --> 01:21:01.289
The woman can't bake worth shit.

1110
01:21:02.667 --> 01:21:04.459
Thank you, sir.

1111
01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:10.382
- He's got his fingers in a lot of pies, I hear.
- What you hear isn't half of it.

1112
01:21:10.466 --> 01:21:12.926
He's got scams you haven't even dreamed of.

1113
01:21:13.011 --> 01:21:15.053
Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

1114
01:21:15.138 --> 01:21:18.015
There's a river of dirty money
running through this place.

1115
01:21:18.099 --> 01:21:21.351
But the problem with having all that money
is you'll have to explain

1116
01:21:21.436 --> 01:21:24.021
- where it came from.
- That's where I come in.

1117
01:21:24.105 --> 01:21:26.606
I channel it, filter it, funnel it.

1118
01:21:26.691 --> 01:21:29.234
Stocks, securities, tax-free municipals.

1119
01:21:29.318 --> 01:21:31.987
I send that money out into the real world.

1120
01:21:32.071 --> 01:21:35.699
- And when it comes back...
- Clean as a virgin's honey pot, huh?

1121
01:21:35.783 --> 01:21:36.992
Cleaner.

1122
01:21:37.076 --> 01:21:40.704
By the time Norton retires,
I'll have made him a millionaire.

1123
01:21:43.210 --> 01:21:47.630
If they ever catch on, though, he's gonna
wind up in here wearing a number himself.

1124
01:21:47.714 --> 01:21:50.966
Now, Red, I thought you had
a little more faith in me than that.

1125
01:21:51.051 --> 01:21:54.345
I know you're good, Andy,
but all that paper leaves a trail.

1126
01:21:54.429 --> 01:21:57.431
Now, anybody gets curious,
the FBI, the IRS, whatever,

1127
01:21:57.516 --> 01:22:00.351
it's gonna lead to somebody.

1128
01:22:00.435 --> 01:22:02.394
Sure it is. But not to me.

1129
01:22:02.479 --> 01:22:04.480
And certainly not to the Warden.

1130
01:22:08.527 --> 01:22:09.819
All right. Who?

1131
01:22:09.903 --> 01:22:11.612
Randall Stevens.

1132
01:22:11.696 --> 01:22:12.863
Who?

1133
01:22:13.949 --> 01:22:18.661
The silent silent partner. He's the guilty one,
Your Honor. The man with the bank accounts.

1134
01:22:18.745 --> 01:22:20.913
That's where the filtering process starts.

1135
01:22:20.997 --> 01:22:24.166
If they trace anything,
it's just going to lead to him.

1136
01:22:24.251 --> 01:22:25.835
But who is he?

1137
01:22:25.919 --> 01:22:27.962
He's a phantom, an apparition.

1138
01:22:28.046 --> 01:22:30.005
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1139
01:22:30.090 --> 01:22:32.258
I conjured him...

1140
01:22:32.342 --> 01:22:34.385
out of thin air.

1141
01:22:34.469 --> 01:22:37.304
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1142
01:22:40.433 --> 01:22:42.810
Andy, you can't just make a person up.

1143
01:22:42.894 --> 01:22:46.021
Sure you can, if you know how
the system works, where the cracks are.

1144
01:22:46.106 --> 01:22:49.608
It's amazing what you
can accomplish by mail.

1145
01:22:49.693 --> 01:22:52.319
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate,

1146
01:22:52.404 --> 01:22:54.738
a driver's license, social security number.

1147
01:22:54.823 --> 01:22:56.031
You're shitting me?

1148
01:22:56.116 --> 01:22:58.075
If they ever trace any of those accounts,

1149
01:22:58.159 --> 01:23:01.036
they're going to wind up chasing
a figment of my imagination.

1150
01:23:01.121 --> 01:23:03.205
Well, I'll be damned.

1151
01:23:04.499 --> 01:23:06.542
Did I say you were good?

1152
01:23:06.626 --> 01:23:08.794
Shit, you're a Rembrandt!

1153
01:23:09.584 --> 01:23:11.626
You know, the funny thing is,

1154
01:23:11.711 --> 01:23:15.584
on the outside, I was an honest man,
straight as an arrow.

1155
01:23:15.833 --> 01:23:18.209
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1156
01:23:26.959 --> 01:23:28.334
Ever bother you?

1157
01:23:29.446 --> 01:23:32.865
I don't run the scams, Red,
I just process the profits.

1158
01:23:32.949 --> 01:23:34.992
Fine line maybe but...

1159
01:23:35.701 --> 01:23:37.450
I also built that library

1160
01:23:37.701 --> 01:23:40.328
and used it to help a dozen guys
get a high school diploma.

1161
01:23:40.873 --> 01:23:42.749
Why do you think the Warden lets me do it?

1162
01:23:43.623 --> 01:23:45.794
To keep you happy and doing the laundry.

1163
01:23:46.044 --> 01:23:47.294
Money instead of sheets.

1164
01:23:47.543 --> 01:23:50.253
Well, I work cheap. That's the trade-off.

1165
01:23:55.843 --> 01:23:58.052
Willy And The Hand Jive

1166
01:24:05.853 --> 01:24:07.645
♪ I know a cat named...

1167
01:24:07.730 --> 01:24:10.398
Tommy Williams
came to Shawshank in 1965

1168
01:24:10.483 --> 01:24:12.525
on a two-year stretch for B&E.

1169
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:15.156
That's breaking and entering to you.

1170
01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:19.909
The cops caught him sneaking TV sets
out the back door of a JC Penney.

1171
01:24:19.993 --> 01:24:21.744
Young punk.

1172
01:24:21.828 --> 01:24:23.871
Mr. Rock'n'roll.

1173
01:24:23.956 --> 01:24:25.623
Cocky as hell.

1174
01:24:25.707 --> 01:24:28.292
Hey, come on, old boys!
Moving like molasses!

1175
01:24:28.377 --> 01:24:30.336
Making me look bad.

1176
01:24:30.337 --> 01:24:32.296
We liked him immediately.

1177
01:24:32.381 --> 01:24:34.423
So I'm backing out the door, right?

1178
01:24:34.508 --> 01:24:36.217
And I got the TV like this.

1179
01:24:36.301 --> 01:24:40.137
It was a big old thing. I couldn't see
shit. Suddenly, I hears this voice.

1180
01:24:40.222 --> 01:24:42.265
"Freeze, kid! Hands in the air."

1181
01:24:42.349 --> 01:24:44.016
Well, I just stand there,

1182
01:24:44.101 --> 01:24:46.894
holding onto that TV. So,
finally, the voice says,

1183
01:24:46.979 --> 01:24:48.938
"Do you hear what I said, boy?"

1184
01:24:49.022 --> 01:24:51.399
I say, "Yes, sir, I sure did."

1185
01:24:51.483 --> 01:24:55.111
But if I drop this fucking thing, you got
me on destruction of property, too."

1186
01:24:59.199 --> 01:25:01.909
Hey, you've done a stretch
in Cashman, right?

1187
01:25:01.994 --> 01:25:05.830
Yeah. Yeah, that was an easy piece of time,
let me tell you.

1188
01:25:05.914 --> 01:25:08.541
Weekend furloughs, work programs.

1189
01:25:08.625 --> 01:25:10.042
Not like here.

1190
01:25:10.127 --> 01:25:12.461
Sounds like you done time
all over New England.

1191
01:25:12.546 --> 01:25:17.633
Yeah, I've been in and out since I was 13. You
name the place, chances are I've been there.

1192
01:25:17.718 --> 01:25:21.721
Perhaps it's time you
tried a new profession?

1193
01:25:21.805 --> 01:25:26.892
What I mean is, you don't seem to be a good
thief. Maybe you should try something else.

1194
01:25:26.977 --> 01:25:30.813
Yeah, well, what the hell
do you know about it, Capone?

1195
01:25:30.897 --> 01:25:32.648
What are you in for?

1196
01:25:32.733 --> 01:25:34.358
Me?

1197
01:25:35.861 --> 01:25:37.945
The lawyer fucked me.

1198
01:25:41.489 --> 01:25:44.908
Everybody's innocent in here.
Don't you know that?

1199
01:25:52.375 --> 01:25:56.545
As it turned out, Tommy had himself
a young wife and a new baby girl.

1200
01:25:57.589 --> 01:26:02.718
Maybe it was the thought of them on the streets
or his child growing up not knowing her daddy.

1201
01:26:02.802 --> 01:26:06.638
Whatever it was,
something lit a fire under that boy's ass.

1202
01:26:10.602 --> 01:26:13.854
I was thinking of maybe
trying for my high school equivalency.

1203
01:26:13.938 --> 01:26:16.523
I hear you helped a couple
of fellas with that.

1204
01:26:17.734 --> 01:26:19.943
I don't waste time on losers, Tommy.

1205
01:26:21.529 --> 01:26:23.614
I ain't no goddamn loser.

1206
01:26:25.450 --> 01:26:27.534
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

1207
01:26:29.204 --> 01:26:31.246
You really mean that?

1208
01:26:31.331 --> 01:26:32.998
Yes, sir, I do.

1209
01:26:33.082 --> 01:26:35.209
Good. Because if we do this,

1210
01:26:35.293 --> 01:26:38.045
we do it all the way,
100%, nothing half-assed.

1211
01:26:39.172 --> 01:26:41.256
The thing is, see...

1212
01:26:42.425 --> 01:26:44.259
...I don't read so good.

1213
01:26:45.386 --> 01:26:46.595
Well.

1214
01:26:48.348 --> 01:26:50.390
You don't read...

1215
01:26:50.475 --> 01:26:52.559
so well.

1216
01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:55.687
We'll get to that.

1217
01:26:56.773 --> 01:26:58.523
- R.
- R...

1218
01:26:58.608 --> 01:26:59.983
- S.
- S...

1219
01:27:00.068 --> 01:27:02.236
So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

1220
01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:04.738
He started walking him through his ABCs.

1221
01:27:07.081 --> 01:27:09.666
Tommy took to it pretty well, too.

1222
01:27:09.751 --> 01:27:12.711
The boy found brains he never knew he had.

1223
01:27:14.831 --> 01:27:17.831
Before long, Andy started him
on his course requirements.

1224
01:27:18.091 --> 01:27:20.050
He really liked the kid.

1225
01:27:20.134 --> 01:27:23.303
It gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap.

1226
01:27:24.347 --> 01:27:26.389
But that wasn't the only reason.

1227
01:27:26.474 --> 01:27:28.934
Prison time is slow time.

1228
01:27:29.977 --> 01:27:32.229
So you do what you can to keep going.

1229
01:27:32.851 --> 01:27:35.102
Some fellas collect stamps.

1230
01:27:35.103 --> 01:27:37.730
Others build matchstick houses.

1231
01:27:38.361 --> 01:27:40.737
Andy built a library.

1232
01:27:41.781 --> 01:27:43.823
Now he needed a new project.

1233
01:27:43.908 --> 01:27:45.951
Tommy was it.

1234
01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:50.572
It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.

1235
01:27:50.656 --> 01:27:54.284
The same reason
he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.

1236
01:27:55.661 --> 01:27:57.161
In prison,

1237
01:27:57.246 --> 01:28:00.373
a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1238
01:28:01.834 --> 01:28:06.296
By 1966, right about the time
Tommy was getting ready to take his exams,

1239
01:28:06.297 --> 01:28:08.339
it was lovely Raquel.

1240
01:28:25.608 --> 01:28:26.649
Time.

1241
01:28:32.656 --> 01:28:33.948
Well?

1242
01:28:35.034 --> 01:28:36.576
Well, it's for shit.

1243
01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:39.162
I wasted a whole fucking year of my time

1244
01:28:39.246 --> 01:28:42.415
- with this bullshit.
- It's probably not as bad as you think.

1245
01:28:42.499 --> 01:28:46.210
It's worse. I didn't get one thing right.
It might as well have been in Chinese.

1246
01:28:46.295 --> 01:28:48.796
Let's see how the score comes out.

1247
01:28:48.881 --> 01:28:51.507
Well, I'll tell you how the goddamn score
comes out.

1248
01:28:53.302 --> 01:28:55.219
Two points right there.

1249
01:28:55.304 --> 01:28:57.096
There's your goddamn score!

1250
01:28:57.181 --> 01:29:01.017
Goddamn cats crawling up trees,
5x5 is 25.

1251
01:29:02.102 --> 01:29:03.645
Fuck this place!

1252
01:29:03.646 --> 01:29:04.937
Fuck it!

1253
01:29:23.749 --> 01:29:26.501
I feel bad. I let him down.

1254
01:29:26.585 --> 01:29:28.670
Ah, that's crap, kid.

1255
01:29:28.671 --> 01:29:30.213
He's proud of you.

1256
01:29:30.297 --> 01:29:33.424
We've been friends a long time
so I know him as good as anybody.

1257
01:29:33.509 --> 01:29:36.386
- A smart fellow, ain't he?
- As smart as they come.

1258
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:38.513
He used to be a banker on the outside.

1259
01:29:38.597 --> 01:29:40.640
What's he in here for, anyway?

1260
01:29:40.724 --> 01:29:42.225
Murder.

1261
01:29:43.352 --> 01:29:45.103
The hell you say!

1262
01:29:47.231 --> 01:29:49.524
You wouldn't think it to look at the guy.

1263
01:29:50.567 --> 01:29:53.027
He caught his wife in
bed with some golf pro.

1264
01:29:53.112 --> 01:29:55.196
He greased them both.

1265
01:30:02.089 --> 01:30:03.965
What?

1266
01:30:04.049 --> 01:30:06.426
About four years ago,

1267
01:30:06.510 --> 01:30:09.595
I was in Thomaston on a
two-to-three stretch.

1268
01:30:10.848 --> 01:30:13.933
I stole a car. It was a
dumb-fuck thing to do.

1269
01:30:15.310 --> 01:30:17.353
About six months left to go,

1270
01:30:17.437 --> 01:30:19.480
I get a new cellmate in.

1271
01:30:19.564 --> 01:30:21.440
Elmo Blatch.

1272
01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:24.144
Big, twitchy fucker.

1273
01:30:24.810 --> 01:30:27.103
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.

1274
01:30:27.279 --> 01:30:29.322
You know what I'm saying?

1275
01:30:29.406 --> 01:30:31.449
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1276
01:30:31.779 --> 01:30:34.029
He said he'd pulled hundreds of jobs.

1277
01:30:34.278 --> 01:30:36.154
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.

1278
01:30:36.239 --> 01:30:39.241
You'd cut a loud fart,
he'd jump three feet in the air.

1279
01:30:40.368 --> 01:30:42.410
Talked all the time, too.

1280
01:30:42.495 --> 01:30:44.830
That's the other thing. He never shut up.

1281
01:30:44.914 --> 01:30:46.957
Places he'd been in,

1282
01:30:47.041 --> 01:30:49.709
jobs he'd pulled, women he'd fucked.

1283
01:30:49.794 --> 01:30:52.212
Even people he'd killed.

1284
01:30:54.048 --> 01:30:56.424
People who gave him shit.

1285
01:30:57.468 --> 01:30:59.511
That's how he put it.

1286
01:30:59.595 --> 01:31:01.138
So...

1287
01:31:01.222 --> 01:31:03.306
one night, like a joke,

1288
01:31:04.350 --> 01:31:07.644
I say to him, I say,
"Yeah, Elmo, who did you kill?"

1289
01:31:08.433 --> 01:31:09.442
So he says...

1290
01:31:09.692 --> 01:31:13.320
I got me this job one time
bussing tables at a country club.

1291
01:31:14.447 --> 01:31:18.033
So I could case
all these big rich pricks that come in.

1292
01:31:20.453 --> 01:31:22.454
So I pick out this guy,

1293
01:31:23.498 --> 01:31:26.083
go in one night and do his place.

1294
01:31:28.253 --> 01:31:30.254
He wakes up.

1295
01:31:30.338 --> 01:31:32.381
He gives me shit.

1296
01:31:33.424 --> 01:31:35.509
So I killed him.

1297
01:31:36.552 --> 01:31:38.637
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1298
01:31:40.932 --> 01:31:42.849
That's the best part.

1299
01:31:43.893 --> 01:31:47.104
She's fucking this prick,
see, this golf pro.

1300
01:31:47.188 --> 01:31:49.273
But she's married to some other guy.

1301
01:31:50.316 --> 01:31:52.401
Some hotshot banker.

1302
01:31:54.195 --> 01:31:56.280
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1303
01:32:07.965 --> 01:32:11.801
I have to say
that's the most amazing story I ever heard.

1304
01:32:13.428 --> 01:32:16.305
What amazes me most is
you were taken in by it.

1305
01:32:16.390 --> 01:32:18.015
Sir?

1306
01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:19.767
Well...

1307
01:32:19.852 --> 01:32:23.229
it's obvious this fella Williams
is impressed with you.

1308
01:32:23.313 --> 01:32:25.398
He hears your tale of woe

1309
01:32:25.482 --> 01:32:28.401
and quite naturally wants to cheer you up.

1310
01:32:28.485 --> 01:32:30.528
He's young, not terribly bright.

1311
01:32:30.612 --> 01:32:34.490
Not surprising he wouldn't know
what a state he'd put you in.

1312
01:32:34.575 --> 01:32:36.701
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1313
01:32:36.785 --> 01:32:40.830
Well, let's say, for the moment,
this Blatch does exist.

1314
01:32:40.914 --> 01:32:44.041
You think he'd just fall
to his knees and cry,

1315
01:32:44.126 --> 01:32:46.335
"Yes, I did it! I confess!

1316
01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:48.629
And by the way,
add a life term to my sentence"?

1317
01:32:48.714 --> 01:32:51.883
That doesn't matter. With Tommy's
testimony, I can get a new trial.

1318
01:32:51.967 --> 01:32:55.177
That's assuming Blatch is even still there.

1319
01:32:55.262 --> 01:32:57.305
The chances are he'd be released by now.

1320
01:32:57.389 --> 01:32:59.974
They'd have his last address,
names of relatives.

1321
01:33:00.058 --> 01:33:02.226
There's a chance, isn't there?

1322
01:33:04.271 --> 01:33:06.147
How can you be so obtuse?

1323
01:33:06.231 --> 01:33:07.732
What?

1324
01:33:09.234 --> 01:33:11.068
What did you call me?

1325
01:33:11.153 --> 01:33:12.987
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1326
01:33:13.071 --> 01:33:14.864
Son, you're forgetting yourself.

1327
01:33:14.948 --> 01:33:17.783
The country club will
have his old timecards,

1328
01:33:17.868 --> 01:33:19.994
records, W-2s,

1329
01:33:20.078 --> 01:33:24.081
- with his name on them.
- If you indulge this fantasy, that's your business.

1330
01:33:24.166 --> 01:33:28.127
- Don't make it mine. This meeting is over.
- Sir, if I were to ever get out,

1331
01:33:28.211 --> 01:33:33.077
I would never mention what goes on in here. I'd
be as indictable as you for laundering money.

1332
01:33:33.828 --> 01:33:36.830
Don't ever mention money to me again,
you sorry son of a bitch!

1333
01:33:36.914 --> 01:33:38.790
Not in this office.

1334
01:33:38.791 --> 01:33:40.917
Not anywhere! Get in here now.

1335
01:33:41.002 --> 01:33:44.254
I'm just trying to set your mind at ease,
that's all. Sir, I...

1336
01:33:44.338 --> 01:33:45.714
Solitary. A month.

1337
01:33:45.798 --> 01:33:47.966
- Yes, sir.
- What's the matter with you?

1338
01:33:48.770 --> 01:33:52.023
- Get him out of here.
- This is my chance to get out! Don't you see?

1339
01:33:52.024 --> 01:33:54.025
It's my life! Don't you understand?

1340
01:33:54.109 --> 01:33:56.569
- Get him out! Get him out!
- This is my life!

1341
01:33:56.653 --> 01:33:57.904
No!

1342
01:33:57.988 --> 01:33:59.822
A month in the hole.

1343
01:33:59.907 --> 01:34:02.492
It's the longest damn
stretch I ever heard of.

1344
01:34:02.576 --> 01:34:04.368
It's all my fault.

1345
01:34:04.453 --> 01:34:05.870
Oh, bullshit.

1346
01:34:05.954 --> 01:34:09.248
You didn't pull the trigger
and you certainly didn't convict him.

1347
01:34:09.333 --> 01:34:11.709
Red, are you saying that Andy is innocent?

1348
01:34:11.793 --> 01:34:13.961
I mean, for real innocent?

1349
01:34:14.046 --> 01:34:16.088
It looks that way.

1350
01:34:16.173 --> 01:34:18.216
Sweet Jesus.

1351
01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:20.343
How long's he been here now?

1352
01:34:20.427 --> 01:34:22.470
1947. What is that?

1353
01:34:22.554 --> 01:34:24.096
- 19 years.
- 19 years...

1354
01:34:24.181 --> 01:34:26.807
- Williams, Thomas.
- Yeah, over here.

1355
01:34:29.186 --> 01:34:31.437
- Paxon, Edward.
- Yeah.

1356
01:34:32.648 --> 01:34:35.566
What you got? Board of Education.

1357
01:34:35.651 --> 01:34:38.319
- The son of a bitch mailed it.
- Looks like he did.

1358
01:34:38.403 --> 01:34:41.447
Are you gonna open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

1359
01:34:41.532 --> 01:34:43.616
The thumb up my butt sounds better.

1360
01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:47.411
Hey, Skeet, come on,
give me that, you shithead.

1361
01:34:48.455 --> 01:34:50.665
- Floyd, come on.
- Over here, over here!

1362
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.085
Hey, Red!

1363
01:34:55.212 --> 01:34:57.630
Come on, will you throw that away, please?

1364
01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:05.304
Well, shit.

1365
01:35:17.526 --> 01:35:20.236
The kid passed. C+ average.

1366
01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:22.405
Thought you'd like to know.

1367
01:35:38.964 --> 01:35:41.048
The Warden wants to talk.

1368
01:35:54.438 --> 01:35:55.563
Out here?

1369
01:35:55.647 --> 01:35:57.732
That's what the man said.

1370
01:36:14.041 --> 01:36:15.833
Warden?

1371
01:36:15.918 --> 01:36:18.002
Tommy.

1372
01:36:23.467 --> 01:36:24.926
Tommy...

1373
01:36:25.010 --> 01:36:29.096
I'm asking you to keep this conversation
just between us.

1374
01:36:30.515 --> 01:36:32.600
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1375
01:36:51.078 --> 01:36:53.162
We got a situation here.

1376
01:36:54.206 --> 01:36:56.248
I think you can appreciate that.

1377
01:36:56.333 --> 01:36:57.792
Yes, sir.

1378
01:36:57.876 --> 01:36:59.377
I sure can.

1379
01:36:59.461 --> 01:37:03.506
I tell you, son, this thing really
came along and knocked my wind out.

1380
01:37:05.217 --> 01:37:07.131
It's got me up nights, that's the truth.

1381
01:37:09.223 --> 01:37:11.307
The right thing to do.

1382
01:37:12.973 --> 01:37:15.975
Sometimes it's hard to know what that is.

1383
01:37:17.733 --> 01:37:19.775
You understand?

1384
01:37:21.153 --> 01:37:23.237
I need your help, son.

1385
01:37:24.656 --> 01:37:26.741
If I'm going to move on this,

1386
01:37:26.742 --> 01:37:29.493
there can't be the least
little shred of doubt.

1387
01:37:31.038 --> 01:37:34.457
I have to know
if what you told Dufresne was the truth.

1388
01:37:34.541 --> 01:37:36.125
Yes, sir.

1389
01:37:36.126 --> 01:37:37.752
Absolutely.

1390
01:37:37.836 --> 01:37:40.921
Would you be willing
to swear before a judge and jury,

1391
01:37:41.006 --> 01:37:43.424
having placed your hand on the Good Book

1392
01:37:43.425 --> 01:37:46.135
and taken an oath before
Almighty God himself?

1393
01:37:46.219 --> 01:37:48.346
Just give me that chance.

1394
01:37:52.267 --> 01:37:53.934
That's what I thought.

1395
01:38:41.024 --> 01:38:43.109
I'm sure by now you've heard...

1396
01:38:44.361 --> 01:38:45.736
A terrible thing.

1397
01:38:47.197 --> 01:38:50.783
A man that young, less than a year to go,
trying to escape.

1398
01:38:51.868 --> 01:38:54.495
It broke Captain Hadley's
heart to shoot him.

1399
01:38:55.539 --> 01:38:57.623
Truly, it did.

1400
01:38:59.668 --> 01:39:01.752
We just have to put it behind us.

1401
01:39:03.922 --> 01:39:05.339
Move on.

1402
01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:08.676
I'm done.

1403
01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:11.804
Everything stops.

1404
01:39:12.848 --> 01:39:15.683
Get someone else to run your scams.

1405
01:39:17.018 --> 01:39:19.103
Nothing stops.

1406
01:39:20.147 --> 01:39:22.231
Nothing.

1407
01:39:23.984 --> 01:39:26.068
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

1408
01:39:27.946 --> 01:39:30.531
No more protection from the guards.

1409
01:39:30.615 --> 01:39:32.950
I'll pull you out of that one-bunk Hilton

1410
01:39:33.034 --> 01:39:35.202
and cast you down with the Sodomites.

1411
01:39:36.955 --> 01:39:39.457
You'll think you've been fucked by a train.

1412
01:39:40.751 --> 01:39:42.793
And the library?

1413
01:39:42.878 --> 01:39:44.003
Gone.

1414
01:39:44.087 --> 01:39:46.464
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1415
01:39:47.507 --> 01:39:50.301
We'll have us a little
book barbecue in the yard.

1416
01:39:50.385 --> 01:39:52.428
They'll see the flames for miles.

1417
01:39:52.512 --> 01:39:55.014
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

1418
01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:58.517
You understand me?

1419
01:39:58.602 --> 01:40:00.686
Catching my drift?

1420
01:40:03.774 --> 01:40:05.858
Or am I being obtuse?

1421
01:40:16.995 --> 01:40:19.121
Give him another month to think about it.

1422
01:41:06.711 --> 01:41:09.755
My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.

1423
01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:11.924
Like a closed book.

1424
01:41:13.134 --> 01:41:15.886
Complained about it all the time.

1425
01:41:15.971 --> 01:41:18.055
She was beautiful.

1426
01:41:20.267 --> 01:41:22.351
God, I loved her.

1427
01:41:25.355 --> 01:41:27.690
I just didn't know how
to show it, that's all.

1428
01:41:30.193 --> 01:41:32.278
I killed her, Red.

1429
01:41:33.738 --> 01:41:35.823
I didn't pull the trigger.

1430
01:41:37.242 --> 01:41:39.326
But I drove her away.

1431
01:41:40.537 --> 01:41:43.080
That's why she died, because of me.

1432
01:41:43.164 --> 01:41:45.249
The way I am.

1433
01:41:53.592 --> 01:41:55.676
That don't make you a murderer.

1434
01:41:58.889 --> 01:42:00.973
A bad husband, maybe.

1435
01:42:04.352 --> 01:42:07.730
Feel bad about it if you want to,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

1436
01:42:07.814 --> 01:42:09.231
No, I didn't.

1437
01:42:09.316 --> 01:42:11.358
Somebody else did.

1438
01:42:12.652 --> 01:42:14.737
And I wound up in here.

1439
01:42:17.115 --> 01:42:19.199
Bad luck, I guess.

1440
01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:23.829
Yeah.

1441
01:42:23.914 --> 01:42:26.206
It floats around.

1442
01:42:26.291 --> 01:42:28.751
It's got to land on somebody.

1443
01:42:29.627 --> 01:42:31.878
It was my turn, that's all.

1444
01:42:32.127 --> 01:42:34.587
I was in the path of the tornado.

1445
01:42:41.177 --> 01:42:44.930
I just didn't expect
the storm would last as long as it has.

1446
01:42:49.009 --> 01:42:50.926
Do you think you'll ever get out of here?

1447
01:42:52.178 --> 01:42:53.846
Me?

1448
01:42:56.141 --> 01:42:57.600
Yeah.

1449
01:42:58.643 --> 01:43:00.603
One day, when I've got a long, white beard

1450
01:43:00.687 --> 01:43:03.566
and two or three marbles rolling
around upstairs, they'll let me out.

1451
01:43:04.816 --> 01:43:06.900
I tell you where I'd go.

1452
01:43:08.111 --> 01:43:09.737
Zihuatanejo.

1453
01:43:09.821 --> 01:43:11.739
Zi... what?

1454
01:43:11.823 --> 01:43:13.866
Zihuatanejo.

1455
01:43:14.816 --> 01:43:16.901
It's in Mexico.

1456
01:43:17.837 --> 01:43:20.047
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1457
01:43:21.299 --> 01:43:23.675
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

1458
01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:25.218
No.

1459
01:43:25.303 --> 01:43:27.387
They say it has no memory.

1460
01:43:29.849 --> 01:43:32.392
That's where I want to
live the rest of my life.

1461
01:43:33.978 --> 01:43:36.063
A warm place with no memory.

1462
01:43:39.691 --> 01:43:41.984
Open up a little hotel,

1463
01:43:43.820 --> 01:43:45.696
right on the beach.

1464
01:43:45.780 --> 01:43:47.823
Buy some worthless old boat,

1465
01:43:47.907 --> 01:43:49.992
fix it up new.

1466
01:43:52.365 --> 01:43:53.573
Take my guests out.

1467
01:43:54.374 --> 01:43:56.458
Charter fishing.

1468
01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:02.506
Zihuatanejo, huh?

1469
01:44:05.135 --> 01:44:09.013
In a place like that, I could use a man
who knows how to get things.

1470
01:44:15.437 --> 01:44:18.147
I don't think I could make
it on the outside, Andy.

1471
01:44:24.905 --> 01:44:26.989
I've been in here most of my life.

1472
01:44:28.492 --> 01:44:30.284
I'm an institutional man now.

1473
01:44:30.863 --> 01:44:32.947
Just like Brooks was.

1474
01:44:34.366 --> 01:44:36.617
Well, you underestimate yourself.

1475
01:44:36.702 --> 01:44:38.786
I don't think so.

1476
01:44:41.415 --> 01:44:45.626
I mean... in here, I'm the guy
who can get things for you, sure.

1477
01:44:45.711 --> 01:44:49.630
But outside, all you need
is the Yellow Pages.

1478
01:44:49.715 --> 01:44:52.133
Hell, I wouldn't even know where to begin.

1479
01:44:54.219 --> 01:44:55.765
The Pacific Ocean?

1480
01:44:56.015 --> 01:44:57.264
Shit.

1481
01:44:57.515 --> 01:45:00.684
- About scare me to death, something that big.
- Not me.

1482
01:45:02.568 --> 01:45:06.028
I didn't shoot my wife and
I didn't shoot her lover.

1483
01:45:06.568 --> 01:45:10.196
Whatever mistakes I've made,
I've paid for them and then some.

1484
01:45:11.067 --> 01:45:13.235
That hotel, that boat.

1485
01:45:14.821 --> 01:45:16.989
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1486
01:45:21.625 --> 01:45:24.502
I don't think you ought to be
doing this to yourself, Andy.

1487
01:45:24.587 --> 01:45:26.629
These are just shitty pipe dreams.

1488
01:45:26.714 --> 01:45:29.674
I mean, Mexico is way the hell down there
and you're in here.

1489
01:45:29.758 --> 01:45:30.848
And that's the way it is.

1490
01:45:31.598 --> 01:45:34.224
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.

1491
01:45:35.977 --> 01:45:38.061
It's down there and I'm in here.

1492
01:45:40.773 --> 01:45:43.567
I guess it comes down to
a simple choice, really.

1493
01:45:46.404 --> 01:45:48.447
Get busy living

1494
01:45:48.531 --> 01:45:51.450
or get busy dying.

1495
01:45:55.246 --> 01:45:57.331
Andy.

1496
01:45:59.792 --> 01:46:01.877
Red.

1497
01:46:02.921 --> 01:46:05.339
If you ever get out of here, do me a favor.

1498
01:46:05.423 --> 01:46:07.257
Sure, Andy.

1499
01:46:07.342 --> 01:46:08.675
Anything.

1500
01:46:09.761 --> 01:46:13.221
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

1501
01:46:15.224 --> 01:46:19.019
- Well, just... There's a lot of hayfields up there.
- One in particular.

1502
01:46:19.103 --> 01:46:21.146
It's got a long rock wall

1503
01:46:21.230 --> 01:46:23.148
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1504
01:46:23.232 --> 01:46:25.943
It's like something out
of a Robert Frost poem.

1505
01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:30.030
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1506
01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:35.035
We went there for a picnic
and made love under that oak.

1507
01:46:36.537 --> 01:46:38.622
I asked and she said yes.

1508
01:46:42.752 --> 01:46:44.795
Promise me, Red,

1509
01:46:44.879 --> 01:46:46.880
if you ever get out,

1510
01:46:46.965 --> 01:46:48.461
find that spot.

1511
01:46:49.461 --> 01:46:54.924
At the base of that wall, you'll find a rock that
has no earthly business in a Maine hayfield.

1512
01:46:55.008 --> 01:46:57.510
A piece of black, volcanic glass.

1513
01:47:01.462 --> 01:47:04.256
There's something buried under it
I want you to have.

1514
01:47:04.340 --> 01:47:06.341
What, Andy?

1515
01:47:06.426 --> 01:47:08.510
What's buried under there?

1516
01:47:10.305 --> 01:47:13.682
You'll have to pry it up to see.

1517
01:47:19.022 --> 01:47:21.106
No, I'm telling you, the guy is...

1518
01:47:22.150 --> 01:47:24.234
He's talking funnier.

1519
01:47:24.319 --> 01:47:27.696
- I'm really worried about him.
- We ought to keep an eye on him.

1520
01:47:27.780 --> 01:47:31.825
That's fine during the day, but at night
he's got that cell all to himself.

1521
01:47:32.911 --> 01:47:34.369
Oh, Lord.

1522
01:47:34.454 --> 01:47:36.496
What?

1523
01:47:38.166 --> 01:47:40.500
Andy come down to the loading dock today.

1524
01:47:40.585 --> 01:47:44.087
- He asked me for a length of rope.
- Rope?

1525
01:47:44.172 --> 01:47:46.006
Six feet long.

1526
01:47:46.090 --> 01:47:47.549
And you gave it to him?

1527
01:47:47.634 --> 01:47:50.302
Sure I did. Why wouldn't I?

1528
01:47:50.303 --> 01:47:52.012
Jesus, Heywood.

1529
01:47:52.096 --> 01:47:54.348
Hey, how the hell was I supposed to know?

1530
01:47:54.432 --> 01:47:56.350
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1531
01:47:56.434 --> 01:47:57.476
No.

1532
01:47:58.519 --> 01:48:00.729
Andy would never do that.

1533
01:48:00.730 --> 01:48:02.814
Never.

1534
01:48:03.858 --> 01:48:05.943
I don't know.

1535
01:48:07.987 --> 01:48:10.072
Every man has his breaking point.

1536
01:48:12.700 --> 01:48:13.951
Lickety-split.

1537
01:48:14.035 --> 01:48:16.912
- I want to get home.
- Just about finished, sir.

1538
01:48:33.012 --> 01:48:35.097
Three deposits tonight.

1539
01:48:43.481 --> 01:48:45.565
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1540
01:48:45.566 --> 01:48:49.027
And shine my shoes.
I want 'em looking like mirrors.

1541
01:48:49.112 --> 01:48:50.487
Yes, sir.

1542
01:48:55.785 --> 01:48:57.452
It's good having you back, Andy.

1543
01:48:57.537 --> 01:49:00.289
The place wasn't the same without you.

1544
01:49:47.337 --> 01:49:50.088
Lights out!

1545
01:50:20.828 --> 01:50:23.121
I've had some long nights in stir.

1546
01:50:24.165 --> 01:50:26.875
Alone in the dark with
nothing but your thoughts,

1547
01:50:26.959 --> 01:50:28.794
time can draw out like a blade.

1548
01:50:35.176 --> 01:50:37.511
That was the longest night of my life.

1549
01:50:53.653 --> 01:50:55.278
Give me a count.

1550
01:50:59.617 --> 01:51:01.660
Tier 3 South. Clear.

1551
01:51:01.744 --> 01:51:03.078
Tier 4 North. Clear.

1552
01:51:03.162 --> 01:51:06.748
- Tier 3 North. Clear.
- Man missing on Tier 2.

1553
01:51:06.761 --> 01:51:09.846
- Cell 245.
- Dufresne.

1554
01:51:10.270 --> 01:51:13.189
Get your ass out here, boy.
You're holding up the show.

1555
01:51:15.693 --> 01:51:19.737
Don't make me come down there.
I'll thump your skull for you.

1556
01:51:27.329 --> 01:51:30.707
Damn it, Dufresne, you're putting me
behind! I got a schedule to keep.

1557
01:51:30.791 --> 01:51:33.876
You'd better be sick or dead in there,
I shit you not!

1558
01:51:33.961 --> 01:51:35.795
You hear me?

1559
01:51:42.302 --> 01:51:44.387
Oh, my holy God.

1560
01:52:01.238 --> 01:52:03.948
I want every man on this
cell block questioned.

1561
01:52:03.949 --> 01:52:06.159
- Start with that friend of his.
- Who?

1562
01:52:06.243 --> 01:52:07.452
Him!

1563
01:52:09.371 --> 01:52:11.456
Open 237.

1564
01:52:14.460 --> 01:52:16.586
What do you mean, he just wasn't here?

1565
01:52:16.670 --> 01:52:18.212
Don't say that to me, Haig.

1566
01:52:18.297 --> 01:52:20.548
Don't say that to me again.

1567
01:52:20.632 --> 01:52:21.716
But, sir, he wasn't.

1568
01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:23.968
I can see that, Haig!

1569
01:52:24.052 --> 01:52:25.845
You think I'm blind?

1570
01:52:25.846 --> 01:52:28.973
Is that what you're saying?
Am I blind, Haig?

1571
01:52:29.057 --> 01:52:30.057
No, sir.

1572
01:52:30.142 --> 01:52:32.185
What about you?

1573
01:52:32.269 --> 01:52:34.103
Are you blind?

1574
01:52:34.188 --> 01:52:36.731
- Tell me what this is.
- Last night's count.

1575
01:52:36.815 --> 01:52:40.109
You see Dufresne's name there?
I sure do. See? Right there.

1576
01:52:40.194 --> 01:52:42.069
Dufresne.

1577
01:52:42.817 --> 01:52:44.484
He was in his cell at lights out.

1578
01:52:44.568 --> 01:52:47.779
It stands to reason
he'd still be here in the morning.

1579
01:52:48.864 --> 01:52:50.740
I want him found.

1580
01:52:50.825 --> 01:52:53.410
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast.

1581
01:52:53.494 --> 01:52:54.536
Now!

1582
01:52:54.537 --> 01:52:56.037
Yes, sir!

1583
01:52:57.164 --> 01:52:59.749
Let's go, let's go!
Move your butts! Move it!

1584
01:53:02.586 --> 01:53:03.628
Stand.

1585
01:53:04.755 --> 01:53:06.006
Well?

1586
01:53:09.385 --> 01:53:10.510
Well, what?

1587
01:53:10.594 --> 01:53:14.055
I see you two all the time.
You're thick as thieves, you are.

1588
01:53:15.099 --> 01:53:16.725
He must have said something.

1589
01:53:16.809 --> 01:53:18.852
No, sir, Warden.

1590
01:53:18.936 --> 01:53:20.395
Not a word.

1591
01:53:22.398 --> 01:53:24.399
Lord, it's a miracle!

1592
01:53:25.443 --> 01:53:27.902
A man up and vanished
like a fart in the wind.

1593
01:53:28.410 --> 01:53:30.161
Nothing left but...

1594
01:53:30.496 --> 01:53:33.415
some damn rocks on a windowsill.

1595
01:53:33.499 --> 01:53:35.250
And that cupcake on the wall.

1596
01:53:35.334 --> 01:53:36.960
Let's ask her.

1597
01:53:37.044 --> 01:53:41.006
Maybe she knows. What say there,
Fuzzy Britches? Feel like talking?

1598
01:53:42.091 --> 01:53:43.174
Ah...

1599
01:53:43.175 --> 01:53:44.634
I guess not.

1600
01:53:44.719 --> 01:53:47.595
Why should she be any different?

1601
01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:50.140
This is a conspiracy.

1602
01:53:50.224 --> 01:53:52.434
That's what this is.

1603
01:53:52.518 --> 01:53:54.060
One big...

1604
01:53:54.145 --> 01:53:56.896
damn conspiracy!

1605
01:53:56.981 --> 01:53:59.649
And everyone's in on it!

1606
01:53:59.734 --> 01:54:01.026
Including her!

1607
01:54:35.186 --> 01:54:37.062
In 1966,

1608
01:54:37.146 --> 01:54:39.815
Andy Dufresne escaped

1609
01:54:39.899 --> 01:54:41.984
from Shawshank Prison.

1610
01:54:43.653 --> 01:54:46.405
All they found of him
was a muddy set of prison clothes,

1611
01:54:46.489 --> 01:54:48.532
a bar of soap

1612
01:54:48.616 --> 01:54:52.995
and an old rock hammer
damn near worn down to the nub.

1613
01:54:57.375 --> 01:55:02.212
I remember thinking it would take a man 600
years to tunnel through the wall with it.

1614
01:55:02.297 --> 01:55:05.007
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

1615
01:55:23.568 --> 01:55:25.652
Oh, Andy loved geology.

1616
01:55:26.696 --> 01:55:30.198
I imagine it appealed to
his meticulous nature.

1617
01:55:30.283 --> 01:55:32.576
An Ice Age here,

1618
01:55:32.660 --> 01:55:35.245
a million years of mountain-building there.

1619
01:55:36.289 --> 01:55:38.707
Geology is the study of pressure and time.

1620
01:55:39.917 --> 01:55:41.960
That's all it takes, really.

1621
01:55:42.045 --> 01:55:44.087
Pressure...

1622
01:55:44.172 --> 01:55:46.048
and time.

1623
01:55:46.132 --> 01:55:49.468
That and a big goddamn poster.

1624
01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:54.056
Like I said,

1625
01:55:54.057 --> 01:55:57.851
in prison, a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1626
01:56:00.647 --> 01:56:05.817
It turns out Andy's favorite hobby was
toting his wall out into the exercise yard.

1627
01:56:05.902 --> 01:56:07.986
A handful at a time.

1628
01:56:09.822 --> 01:56:11.990
I guess after Tommy was killed,

1629
01:56:12.075 --> 01:56:14.910
Andy decided he'd been here
just about long enough.

1630
01:56:14.994 --> 01:56:17.204
Lickety-split. I want to get home.

1631
01:56:18.498 --> 01:56:20.582
I'm just about finished, sir.

1632
01:56:41.979 --> 01:56:44.064
Three deposits tonight.

1633
01:56:51.239 --> 01:56:53.281
Andy did like he was told.

1634
01:56:54.325 --> 01:56:57.828
Buffed those shoes to a high mirror shine.

1635
01:57:01.416 --> 01:57:03.458
The guard simply didn't notice.

1636
01:57:03.543 --> 01:57:05.585
Neither did I.

1637
01:57:05.670 --> 01:57:10.006
I mean, seriously, how often
do you really look at a man's shoes?

1638
01:59:14.048 --> 01:59:20.220
Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards of
shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine.

1639
01:59:21.556 --> 01:59:23.557
Or maybe I just don't want to.

1640
01:59:28.271 --> 01:59:30.480
500 yards.

1641
01:59:31.524 --> 01:59:34.025
That's the length of five football fields.

1642
01:59:35.069 --> 01:59:37.320
Just shy of half a mile.

1643
02:00:32.543 --> 02:00:37.088
The next morning, right about the time
Raquel was spilling her little secret,

1644
02:00:37.173 --> 02:00:40.592
a man nobody ever laid eyes on before

1645
02:00:40.676 --> 02:00:43.094
strode into the Maine National Bank.

1646
02:00:43.179 --> 02:00:45.221
Until that moment,

1647
02:00:45.306 --> 02:00:47.182
he didn't exist,

1648
02:00:47.266 --> 02:00:48.600
except on paper.

1649
02:00:48.684 --> 02:00:49.726
May I help you?

1650
02:00:49.810 --> 02:00:51.853
He had all the proper ID,

1651
02:00:51.938 --> 02:00:55.565
driver's license, birth certificate,
social security card.

1652
02:00:55.650 --> 02:00:58.944
And the signature was a spot-on match.

1653
02:00:59.028 --> 02:01:02.072
I must say, I'm sorry to
be losing your business.

1654
02:01:02.156 --> 02:01:04.157
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

1655
02:01:04.241 --> 02:01:06.034
Thank you.

1656
02:01:06.118 --> 02:01:07.911
I'm sure I will.

1657
02:01:07.995 --> 02:01:10.121
Here's your cashier's check, sir.

1658
02:01:10.206 --> 02:01:12.248
Will there be anything else?

1659
02:01:12.333 --> 02:01:13.333
Please...

1660
02:01:13.417 --> 02:01:16.503
Would you add this to your outgoing mail?

1661
02:01:16.587 --> 02:01:18.797
I'd be happy to.

1662
02:01:18.881 --> 02:01:21.216
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.

1663
02:01:21.300 --> 02:01:26.096
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks
in the Portland area that morning.

1664
02:01:27.264 --> 02:01:33.728
All told, he blew town with better than
$370,000 of Warden Norton's money.

1665
02:01:33.813 --> 02:01:36.272
Severance pay for 19 years.

1666
02:01:44.407 --> 02:01:46.700
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

1667
02:02:39.420 --> 02:02:42.422
Byron Hadley?
You have the right to remain silent.

1668
02:02:42.506 --> 02:02:47.135
If you give up the right to remain silent, anything
you say will be held against you in court.

1669
02:02:47.219 --> 02:02:49.095
I wasn't there to see it.

1670
02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:54.059
But I hear Byron Hadley started sobbing
like a little girl when they took him away.

1671
02:02:59.482 --> 02:03:02.275
Norton had no intention
of going that quietly.

1672
02:03:18.250 --> 02:03:19.709
Samuel Norton?

1673
02:03:19.794 --> 02:03:23.046
We have a warrant for your arrest.
Open up.

1674
02:03:25.925 --> 02:03:27.050
Norton!

1675
02:03:27.134 --> 02:03:28.802
Open the door.

1676
02:03:28.886 --> 02:03:30.637
I'm not sure which key it is.

1677
02:03:33.516 --> 02:03:35.183
Norton!

1678
02:03:40.648 --> 02:03:42.732
Make it easy on yourself, Norton.

1679
02:03:54.036 --> 02:03:57.622
I like to think
the last thing that went through his head,

1680
02:03:57.706 --> 02:03:59.415
other than that bullet,

1681
02:03:59.500 --> 02:04:03.503
was to wonder how the hell
Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

1682
02:04:05.172 --> 02:04:06.256
Carter, James...

1683
02:04:06.340 --> 02:04:09.717
Not long after the Warden
deprived us of his company,

1684
02:04:09.802 --> 02:04:12.053
I got a postcard in the mail.

1685
02:04:13.764 --> 02:04:16.182
It was blank but the postmark said...

1686
02:04:16.267 --> 02:04:19.018
Fort Hancock, Texas.

1687
02:04:19.103 --> 02:04:21.146
Fort Hancock.

1688
02:04:21.230 --> 02:04:23.273
Right on the border.

1689
02:04:23.357 --> 02:04:25.400
That's where Andy crossed.

1690
02:04:25.484 --> 02:04:29.362
When I picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down,

1691
02:04:30.406 --> 02:04:32.490
it always makes me laugh.

1692
02:04:33.909 --> 02:04:35.952
Andy Dufresne,

1693
02:04:36.036 --> 02:04:38.413
who crawled through a river of shit

1694
02:04:38.497 --> 02:04:40.582
and came out clean on the other side.

1695
02:04:41.792 --> 02:04:43.835
Andy Dufresne,

1696
02:04:43.919 --> 02:04:45.837
headed for the Pacific.

1697
02:04:48.424 --> 02:04:50.466
Hadley's got him by the toes, right?

1698
02:04:50.551 --> 02:04:54.762
And he says, "I believe this boy's
about to have himself an accident."

1699
02:04:54.847 --> 02:04:58.016
Those of us who knew him best
talk about him often.

1700
02:04:58.100 --> 02:05:00.351
I swear, the stuff he pulled...

1701
02:05:00.436 --> 02:05:02.937
"These friends of mine
could use a couple of beers!"

1702
02:05:03.022 --> 02:05:05.106
- And he got it.
- And he got it!

1703
02:05:06.275 --> 02:05:08.651
Sometimes it makes me sad, though,

1704
02:05:08.736 --> 02:05:10.778
Andy being gone.

1705
02:05:10.863 --> 02:05:14.866
I have to remind myself
that some birds aren't meant to be caged.

1706
02:05:15.951 --> 02:05:18.036
Their feathers are just too bright.

1707
02:05:19.580 --> 02:05:21.623
And when they fly away,

1708
02:05:21.707 --> 02:05:25.627
the part of you that knows
it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

1709
02:05:27.379 --> 02:05:28.838
But still...

1710
02:05:28.923 --> 02:05:33.092
the place you live in is that much
more drab and empty that they're gone.

1711
02:05:37.640 --> 02:05:39.891
I guess I just miss my friend.

1712
02:06:03.874 --> 02:06:05.750
Please sit down.

1713
02:06:11.340 --> 02:06:13.466
Ellis Boyd Redding.

1714
02:06:13.550 --> 02:06:16.928
Your files say you've served
40 years of a life sentence.

1715
02:06:17.012 --> 02:06:19.389
Do you feel you've been rehabilitated?

1716
02:06:21.517 --> 02:06:23.601
Rehabilitated?

1717
02:06:25.145 --> 02:06:27.230
Well, now, let me see.

1718
02:06:28.274 --> 02:06:30.608
You know, I don't have any idea
what that means.

1719
02:06:32.403 --> 02:06:34.946
Well, it means you're ready
to rejoin society...

1720
02:06:35.030 --> 02:06:37.573
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1721
02:06:39.952 --> 02:06:42.036
To me, it's just a made-up word.

1722
02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:45.331
A politician's word so that...

1723
02:06:45.416 --> 02:06:50.920
young fellas like yourself
can wear a suit and a tie and have a job.

1724
02:06:53.340 --> 02:06:55.425
What do you really want to know?

1725
02:06:56.593 --> 02:06:58.511
Am I sorry for what I did?

1726
02:06:58.595 --> 02:07:00.305
Well, are you?

1727
02:07:01.932 --> 02:07:04.517
There's not a day goes
by I don't feel regret.

1728
02:07:06.103 --> 02:07:09.230
Not because I'm in here
or because you think I should.

1729
02:07:13.027 --> 02:07:15.111
I look back on the way I was then.

1730
02:07:17.698 --> 02:07:19.741
A young...

1731
02:07:19.825 --> 02:07:22.910
stupid kid who committed
that terrible crime.

1732
02:07:26.749 --> 02:07:28.833
I wanna talk to him.

1733
02:07:30.210 --> 02:07:32.378
I wanna try and talk some sense to him,

1734
02:07:33.422 --> 02:07:35.506
tell him the way things are.

1735
02:07:37.676 --> 02:07:39.761
But I can't.

1736
02:07:40.971 --> 02:07:43.056
That kid's long gone.

1737
02:07:44.350 --> 02:07:46.434
This old man is all that's left.

1738
02:07:48.562 --> 02:07:50.063
I gotta live with that.

1739
02:07:51.398 --> 02:07:53.191
Rehabilitated?

1740
02:07:53.275 --> 02:07:55.276
It's just a bullshit word.

1741
02:07:55.361 --> 02:08:01.282
So you go on and stamp your form, sonny,
and stop wasting my time.

1742
02:08:02.368 --> 02:08:04.410
Because to tell you the truth,

1743
02:08:04.495 --> 02:08:06.996
I don't give a shit.

1744
02:09:33.122 --> 02:09:35.207
Here you go, miss.

1745
02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:38.658
Rest room break, boss?

1746
02:09:44.707 --> 02:09:49.002
You don't need to ask me every time you need
to go take a piss. Just go. Understand?

1747
02:09:50.213 --> 02:09:51.880
Yes, sir.

1748
02:10:01.933 --> 02:10:04.976
40 years
I've been asking permission to piss.

1749
02:10:05.978 --> 02:10:08.188
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

1750
02:10:12.318 --> 02:10:14.403
There's a harsh truth to face.

1751
02:10:16.364 --> 02:10:18.698
No way I'm gonna make it on the outside.

1752
02:10:26.916 --> 02:10:30.377
All I do any more
is think of ways to break my parole...

1753
02:10:31.421 --> 02:10:33.505
...so maybe they'd send me back.

1754
02:10:39.011 --> 02:10:41.096
A terrible thing to live in fear.

1755
02:10:42.473 --> 02:10:45.851
Brooks Hatlen knew it,
knew it all too well.

1756
02:10:48.020 --> 02:10:50.814
All I want is to be back
where things make sense,

1757
02:10:51.858 --> 02:10:54.359
where I won't have to
be afraid all the time.

1758
02:10:57.238 --> 02:10:59.322
Only one thing stops me.

1759
02:11:00.366 --> 02:11:02.451
A promise I made to Andy.

1760
02:11:23.181 --> 02:11:25.265
Here it is.

1761
02:11:35.067 --> 02:11:37.152
Much obliged, sir.

1762
02:15:15.955 --> 02:15:17.247
Dear Red,

1763
02:15:17.331 --> 02:15:19.791
if you're reading this, you've gotten out.

1764
02:15:19.875 --> 02:15:24.129
And if you've come this far, maybe
you're willing to come a little further.

1765
02:15:24.213 --> 02:15:26.798
You remember the name
of the town, don't you?

1766
02:15:29.093 --> 02:15:31.177
Zihuatanejo.

1767
02:15:32.221 --> 02:15:33.430
I could use a good man

1768
02:15:33.514 --> 02:15:35.557
to help me get my project on wheels.

1769
02:15:36.068 --> 02:15:38.194
I'll keep an eye out for you

1770
02:15:38.279 --> 02:15:40.321
and the chessboard ready.

1771
02:15:40.568 --> 02:15:41.943
Remember, Red,

1772
02:15:42.028 --> 02:15:44.071
hope is a good thing.

1773
02:15:44.578 --> 02:15:46.621
Maybe the best of things.

1774
02:15:46.705 --> 02:15:48.790
And no good thing ever dies.

1775
02:15:49.833 --> 02:15:52.293
I will be hoping that this letter finds you

1776
02:15:52.377 --> 02:15:54.420
and finds you well.

1777
02:15:54.505 --> 02:15:57.006
Your friend, Andy.

1778
02:16:30.285 --> 02:16:34.163
Get busy living or get busy dying.

1779
02:16:36.667 --> 02:16:38.751
That's goddamn right.

1780
02:16:44.258 --> 02:16:46.384
For the second time in my life,

1781
02:16:46.468 --> 02:16:48.553
I'm guilty of committing a crime.

1782
02:16:50.222 --> 02:16:52.306
Parole violation.

1783
02:16:52.849 --> 02:16:56.560
Of course, I doubt they'll toss up
any roadblocks for that.

1784
02:16:57.099 --> 02:16:59.141
Not for an old crook like me.

1785
02:16:59.226 --> 02:17:01.310
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1786
02:17:05.023 --> 02:17:09.151
I find I'm so excited I can barely sit
still or hold a thought in my head.

1787
02:17:10.195 --> 02:17:13.197
I think it's the excitement
only a free man can feel.

1788
02:17:13.281 --> 02:17:15.991
A free man at the start of a long journey

1789
02:17:16.076 --> 02:17:18.994
whose conclusion is uncertain.

1790
02:17:21.873 --> 02:17:24.041
I hope I can make it across the border.

1791
02:17:25.919 --> 02:17:28.712
I hope to see my friend and shake his hand.

1792
02:17:31.091 --> 02:17:34.301
I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.

1793
02:17:37.055 --> 02:17:38.931
I hope.
