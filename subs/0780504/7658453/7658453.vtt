(WAITER MUMBLING) Go get them.
Go get them.

180
00:20:22.521 --> 00:20:25.149
I don't want that. I don't want that.
You eat it.

181
00:20:25.649 --> 00:20:27.818
Chopsticks
and a fortune cookie.

182
00:20:27.901 --> 00:20:29.778
Put out the fucking cigarette.
I'm eating.

183
00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:31.613
Sorry.

184
00:20:32.448 --> 00:20:33.574
What's the matter
with you?

185
00:20:33.657 --> 00:20:34.950
I'm just...

186
00:20:35.117 --> 00:20:36.744

good business.

I don't know why you want to
change now.

190
00:20:42.124 --> 00:20:45.002
You know how much my business
made last year?

191
00:20:45.336 --> 00:20:46.587
Thirty grand.

192
00:20:46.837 --> 00:20:48.714
I can build a car
in six months

193
00:20:48.797 --> 00:20:51.592
and in six seconds, these jerks write
it off as a stunt

194
00:20:51.675 --> 00:20:53.177
that won't even make
it into the movie.

195
00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.261
Mmm-hmm.

196
00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:57.598
See, all I need is
a hard used stock car.

197
00:20:57.931 --> 00:20:59.016
That's all.

198
00:20:59.099 --> 00:21:03.020
And I figure we start off with small town
circuit and we work our way up.

199
00:21:03.354 --> 00:21:06.023
And once we get to the show,
we're talking millions.

Yeah.

Forget it. Forget it.

given me a number.

unless I was
absolutely sure about it.

209

How can you be sure,
Shannon?

210
00:21:27.336 --> 00:21:30.297
What do you got that the big professional
race teams don't?

211
00:21:32.466 --> 00:21:33.842
I got the driver.

212
00:21:34.176 --> 00:21:36.470
You just told me they had
half a dozen drivers.

I've been working
with him for a while.

216

I've never seen
anything like it.

217
00:21:44.395 --> 00:21:45.771
If I had the money,
I'd back him myself.

218
00:21:46.271 --> 00:21:48.315
Yeah, but you don't
have the money.

219
00:21:49.274 --> 00:21:52.778
Mr. Rose, you put this kid
behind the wheel,

220
00:21:53.445 --> 00:21:55.155
there's nothing
he can't do.

221
00:21:56.031 --> 00:21:58.492
There's money here.
You can't lose.

How's the fucking leg?

I paid my debt.

229
00:22:24.727 --> 00:22:27.521
I'll think about it.
Okay?

230
00:22:28.063 --> 00:22:29.773
But I want to
meet the kid first.

on the spot.

be ready?

Did Shannon ever tell you
how we met?

No.

363
00:32:14.817 --> 00:32:16.568
I used to
produce movies.

364
00:32:16.652 --> 00:32:17.945
In the '80s.

365
00:32:18.237 --> 00:32:21.281
Kind of like action films.
Sexy stuff.

366
00:32:21.365 --> 00:32:23.450
One critic called
them European.

367
00:32:23.534 --> 00:32:25.536
I thought
they were shit.

368
00:32:25.828 --> 00:32:29.415
Anyway, he arranged all the cars for me.
Did all the stunts.

369
00:32:29.498 --> 00:32:31.583
I liked him. I liked having
him around.

370
00:32:31.667 --> 00:32:33.919
Even though he overcharged
the shit out of me.

371
00:32:35.754 --> 00:32:37.423
His next
business venture,

372
00:32:37.589 --> 00:32:40.175
he got involved with
some of Nino's friends.

373
00:32:40.259 --> 00:32:42.636
They didn't go for
the overcharging bit.

374
00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.930
They broke his pelvis.

375
00:32:45.014 --> 00:32:46.724
He's never had
a lot of luck.

376
00:32:49.059 --> 00:32:50.185
The reason
I'm telling you this

377
00:32:50.269 --> 00:32:52.813
is that he has a lot
invested in you.

378
00:32:53.188 --> 00:32:54.523

379
00:32:55.399 --> 00:32:57.818

you call me.

How can you tell?

387
00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:31.143
Because he's
a shark.

388
00:33:32.353 --> 00:33:33.771
There's no
good sharks?

389
00:33:33.854 --> 00:33:36.857
No. I mean, just look at him.

you and Benicio</i>

883
01:29:53.275 --> 01:29:55.986
<i>was the best thing
that ever happened to me.</i>

884
01:30:48.288 --> 01:30:49.873
Did you bring
the money?

885
01:30:56.213 --> 01:30:58.048
Here's what
I'm prepared to offer.

886
01:30:59.049 --> 01:31:01.301
You give me the money,
the girl is safe.

887
01:31:02.219 --> 01:31:04.054
Forever. Nobody
knows about her.

888
01:31:04.138 --> 01:31:05.806
She's off the map.

889
01:31:07.474 --> 01:31:09.685
I can't offer
you the same.

890
01:31:10.894 --> 01:31:12.980
So, this is what
I would suggest.

891
01:31:14.148 --> 01:31:17.109
We conclude our deal.
We'll shake hands.

892
01:31:17.192 --> 01:31:19.528
You start the
rest of your life.

893
01:31:22.197 --> 01:31:24.825
Any dreams you have,
or plans,

894
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:26.827
or hopes for your future...

895
01:31:26.910 --> 01:31:29.288
I think you're going to
have to put that on hold.

896
01:31:30.456 --> 01:31:33.250
For the rest of your life you're going to be
looking over your shoulder.

897
01:31:33.334 --> 01:31:34.710
I'm just telling you this

898
01:31:34.793 --> 01:31:37.212
because I want you
to know the truth.

899
01:31:38.797 --> 01:31:40.215
But the girl is safe.

900
01:32:01.028 --> 01:32:02.780
Where's the money now?

901
01:32:04.448 --> 01:32:06.200
It's in the car.

902
01:32:14.083 --> 01:32:15.459
Come on.
