Anything happens in that five minutes
and I'm yours.

No matter what.

6

of that and you're on your own.

Good.

9
00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.953

on this phone again.

She's down there.

just like you asked for,

13
00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:45.864

on the inside - she is going to fly!

14

You look like a zombie, kid.
You getting any sleep?

15
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.710
Can I offer you some Benzedrine,
Dexedrine, caffeine, nicotine?

16
00:02:54.925 --> 00:02:58.008
Oh, you don't smoke. That's right.
Better off.

17
00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:01.924
There she is!

118
00:18:28.649 --> 00:18:30.640
He's in prison.

119
00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:33.226
Oh.

120
00:18:33.404 --> 00:18:35.486
What do you do?

121
00:18:37.575 --> 00:18:39.532
I drive.

122
00:18:40.911 --> 00:18:43.448
Like a limo driver?

123
00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:45.951
- No, like for movies.
- Oh.

124
00:18:47.918 --> 00:18:50.751
You mean all the car chases and stuff?

125
00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:52.044
Yeah.

126
00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:55.711
Isn't that dangerous?

127
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.052
It's only part-time.

128
00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:09.350
Mostly I work at a garage.

129
00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:12.190
- Where?
- Reseda Boulevard.

130
00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:23.284
I gotta go.

131
00:19:24.664 --> 00:19:26.154
OK.

132
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.537

- Say "bye".

Where are the chopsticks?

137
00:20:18.801 --> 00:20:21.964
- You know, the guy just...
- Go get 'em. Go get 'em.

138
00:20:22.096 --> 00:20:25.054
I don't want that. I don't want that.
You eat it.

139
00:20:25.182 --> 00:20:27.514
Chopsticks and a fortune cookie.

140
00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:30.579
Put out the fuckin'
cigarette! I'm eating.

141
00:20:30.603 --> 00:20:31.603
Sorry.

142
00:20:31.689 --> 00:20:34.852
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm just...

143
00:20:34.984 --> 00:20:37.817
What happened to all the ashtrays
in this town?

144
00:20:37.945 --> 00:20:41.654
You run a good business.
I don't know why you want to change.

145
00:20:41.782 --> 00:20:46.367
You know how much my business made
last year? 30 grand.

146
00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:48.695
I can build a car in six months

147
00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:51.997
and in six seconds,
these jerks write it off as a stunt

148
00:20:52.209 --> 00:20:54.450
that won't even make it into the movie.

149
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:58.789
See, all I need is a hard used stock car.
That's all.

150
00:20:59.008 --> 00:21:02.842
I figure we start off with small
town circuit and work our way up.

151
00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:05.928
Once we get to the show,
we're talking millions.

152
00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.757
- The chopsticks, sir.
- Where's the cookies?

153
00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:12.056
- Uh...
- Forget it. Forget it.

154
00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:15.601
- So you still haven't given me a number.
- All right.

155
00:21:16.692 --> 00:21:18.729
430,000 dollars.

156
00:21:18.861 --> 00:21:20.317
Oh...

157
00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:24.648
Mr Rose, I wouldn't come to you
unless I was absolutely sure about it.

158
00:21:24.867 --> 00:21:26.904
How can you be sure, Shannon?

159
00:21:27.036 --> 00:21:31.246
What do you got
that the big professional race teams don't?

160
00:21:32.416 --> 00:21:36.284
- I got the driver.
- You said they had half a dozen drivers.

161
00:21:36.504 --> 00:21:39.667
Not like this one. This kid is special.

162
00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:44.001
Been working with him for a while.
I've never seen anything like it.

163
00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:48.214
- If I had the money, I'd back him myself.
- Yeah, but you don't.

164
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:55.141
Mr Rose, you put this kid behind the wheel,
there's nothing he can't do.

165
00:21:55.272 --> 00:21:58.390
There's money here. You can't lose.

166
00:21:58.609 --> 00:22:01.271
Fuck you eating Chink food
in my restaurant?

167
00:22:01.403 --> 00:22:03.986
What's a Jew doing running a pizzeria?

168
00:22:04.114 --> 00:22:06.856
You remember Shannon.

169
00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:12.821
Take a fuckin' hike!
I want to talk to my partner.

170
00:22:15.376 --> 00:22:17.458
I'm just fuckin' with you.

171
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:20.537
How you doin', Shannon?
How's the fuckin' leg?

172
00:22:20.673 --> 00:22:23.586
I paid my debt.

173
00:22:24.677 --> 00:22:27.419
I'll think about it. OK?

174
00:22:27.638 --> 00:22:29.675
But I want to meet the kid first.

175
00:22:29.807 --> 00:22:32.299
That's all I ask.

176
00:22:44.572 --> 00:22:46.779
I want you to meet somebody.

177
00:22:46.991 --> 00:22:51.110
Don't say what you like about the car.
I want to drive the price down.

178
00:22:51.328 --> 00:22:53.695
Kid, I want you to meet Mr Bernie Rose.

179
00:22:54.582 --> 00:22:56.493
Nice to meet you.

180
00:23:01.714 --> 00:23:03.751
My hands are a little dirty.

181
00:23:03.883 --> 00:23:06.466
So are mine.

182
00:23:10.514 --> 00:23:13.097
Good driving out there.

183
00:23:13.309 --> 00:23:14.549
Thanks.

184
00:23:17.062 --> 00:23:20.851
He's a good kid. So what do you think?
Do we get the 400?

185
00:23:22.401 --> 00:23:24.938
I'll give you 300 for 70%.

186
00:23:27.948 --> 00:23:29.438
Done.

187
00:23:31.285 --> 00:23:33.117
Right. Good.

188
00:23:33.329 --> 00:23:35.661
(Laughs) You won't be sorry!

189
00:23:41.503 --> 00:23:43.540
- I'm Shannon.
- Hi, I'm Irene.

190
00:23:43.756 --> 00:23:46.168
- How can I help you?
- It just broke down.

191
00:23:46.383 --> 00:23:49.466
- Just like that? Want me to take a look?
- Yes, please.

192
00:23:49.678 --> 00:23:53.171
All right. Uh... We got all our bays full.

193
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:56.974
Hey, pal, just drop it down here.
We'll push it in, all right?

194
00:23:57.186 --> 00:23:59.393
We want to push her in to number three.

195
00:23:59.605 --> 00:24:01.721
- The car, not you.
- Oh, good.

196
00:24:01.941 --> 00:24:03.557
- Hi.
- Hi.

197
00:24:04.985 --> 00:24:07.477
- Ah, you two know each other?
- Don't.

198
00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:10.108
- Oh, look at that.
- We're neighbors.

199
00:24:10.324 --> 00:24:14.113
Neighbors? Very good.
We'll try to be neighborly, too.

200
00:24:34.264 --> 00:24:36.676
- You blinked.
- What?

201
00:24:37.768 --> 00:24:40.931
- Can I call a cab from here?
- Yeah, sure.

202
00:24:42.022 --> 00:24:45.936
What am I talking about?
You and the kid are neighbors, right?

203
00:24:46.151 --> 00:24:48.609
- He can take you home.
- No, I'd feel bad.

204
00:24:48.821 --> 00:24:53.987
No, don't even think twice about it.
He'd be happy to do it. He's a good guy.

205
00:24:55.244 --> 00:24:58.407
He walked into my shop here
five or six years ago.

206
00:24:59.456 --> 00:25:02.323
Right out of the blue, asking for a job.

207
00:25:02.543 --> 00:25:05.911
So I put him to the test
to see what he could do.

208
00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:08.292
- The kid's amazing.
- Yeah.

209
00:25:08.507 --> 00:25:10.874
Sol hire him on the spot - boom!

210
00:25:11.093 --> 00:25:14.677
At about half the wages I normally pay.
He didn't blink an eye.

211
00:25:15.764 --> 00:25:18.722
Hey, kid!
Come over here for a second, will you?

212
00:25:18.934 --> 00:25:21.471
And I have been exploiting him ever since.

213
00:25:21.687 --> 00:25:23.519
(Both laugh)

214
00:25:23.731 --> 00:25:25.563
Ssh, don't tell him.

215
00:25:25.691 --> 00:25:29.309
It looks like we have a bigger problem
than I thought.

216
00:25:29.528 --> 00:25:32.611
We're going to have to keep the car here
for a few days.

217
00:25:32.823 --> 00:25:36.441
So I offered your services
to take BENICIO and Irene home.

218
00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.697
Would that be OK?

219
00:25:40.956 --> 00:25:43.197
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

220
00:25:45.335 --> 00:25:47.997
I don't have wheels... on my car.

221
00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:49.211
OK.

222
00:25:49.423 --> 00:25:52.586
- It's one thing you should know about me.
- Put the tires on.

223
00:25:52.801 --> 00:25:54.838
- You got five minutes?
- Yeah.

224
00:26:17.826 --> 00:26:20.363
Hey, do you want to see something?

225
00:26:22.998 --> 00:26:24.705
Yeah.

226
00:26:27.628 --> 00:26:29.118
OK.

227
00:28:24.411 --> 00:28:26.618
That was good.

228
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:28.867
He had a good time.

229
00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:39.081
Me, too.

230
00:28:45.182 --> 00:28:48.265
Sorry if I put you on the spot
showing up like that.

231
00:28:48.477 --> 00:28:50.514
It's OK.

232
00:29:13.418 --> 00:29:15.876
I'm not doing anything this weekend.

233
00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.541
If you want a ride or something.

234
00:30:02.175 --> 00:30:04.542
(BENICIO giggles)

235
00:30:57.189 --> 00:31:01.808
<i>Don't worry about her bumps and bruises.
Fiberglass is easily replaceable.</i>

236
00:31:01.943 --> 00:31:04.901
Put a coat of paint on there,
some sponsor decals.

237
00:31:05.113 --> 00:31:08.572
The tread on the tires is still good.
We're in business.

238
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:12.034
We paid 300 fucking grand
for this piece of shit?

239
00:31:12.245 --> 00:31:16.864
(Bernie) I paid for it out of my
own pocket. This is just a shell.

240
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.897
The inside counts,
not the outside. Right?

241
00:31:19.921 --> 00:31:20.959
Correct, sir.

242
00:31:21.171 --> 00:31:24.709
Fuck that shit, I pay 300 for something,
I want everybody to fuckin' see it.

243
00:31:24.925 --> 00:31:28.418
- Of course you do.
- Now this...

244
00:31:28.553 --> 00:31:33.218
That is one motherfuckin', fine ass,
pussy mobile motherfucker!

245
00:31:33.433 --> 00:31:34.433
Damn!

246
00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:36.891
Shannon, sell him the car.

247
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.729
He wouldn't be able to find pussy
in a whorehouse.

248
00:31:40.941 --> 00:31:44.809
You know what?
This car will even make you good-looking.

249
00:31:44.945 --> 00:31:48.483
- I'm already good-looking, pal.
- How's it going?

250
00:31:51.201 --> 00:31:53.238
When's our first race?

251
00:31:54.913 --> 00:31:57.075
Pretty soon.

252
00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:59.782
You gonna be ready?

253
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:04.203
- I hope so.
- "I hope so!"

254
00:32:04.339 --> 00:32:07.923
Hey, no false modesty.
I got a lot of money in this.

255
00:32:09.469 --> 00:32:11.676
Did Shannon ever tell you how we met?

256
00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:17.762
I used to produce movies in the '803.

257
00:32:17.894 --> 00:32:21.012
Kinda like action films, sexy stuff.

258
00:32:21.231 --> 00:32:25.350
One critic called them European.
I thought they were shit.

259
00:32:25.569 --> 00:32:29.187
Anyway, he arranged all the cars for me,
did all the stunts.

260
00:32:29.406 --> 00:32:33.741
I liked having him around, even though
he overcharged the shit out of me.

261
00:32:35.495 --> 00:32:39.830
His next business venture, he got involved
with some of Nino's friends.

262
00:32:40.041 --> 00:32:44.410
They didn't go for the overcharging bit.
They broke his pelvis.

263
00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:46.666
He's never had a lot of luck.

264
00:32:48.884 --> 00:32:52.923
The reason I'm telling you this
is that he has a lot invested in you.

265
00:32:53.138 --> 00:32:55.175
And so do I.

266
00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:57.848
So anything you need, you call me.

267
00:32:58.059 --> 00:33:00.096
We're a team now.

268
00:33:02.189 --> 00:33:04.305
I'm excited.

269
00:33:04.524 --> 00:33:07.266
Nino, let's get the fuck out of here!

270
00:33:20.081 --> 00:33:22.698
(TV on)

271
00:33:22.918 --> 00:33:25.751
- Is he a bad guy?
- Yeah.

272
00:33:25.962 --> 00:33:27.999
How can you tell?

273
00:33:28.215 --> 00:33:31.003
Because he... he's a shark.

274
00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:34.376
- There's no good sharks?
- No.

275
00:33:34.596 --> 00:33:37.213
- (Knock at door)
- I mean, just look at him.

276
00:33:37.349 --> 00:33:40.262
Does he look like a good guy to you?

277
00:33:41.853 --> 00:33:44.220
- Hi. How are you?
- Good.

278
00:33:49.736 --> 00:33:51.773
This is Cindy.

279
00:33:52.906 --> 00:33:53.906
Hi.

280
00:33:57.953 --> 00:33:59.990
(Phone rings)

281
00:34:32.862 --> 00:34:34.978
That was my husband's lawyer.

282
00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:38.156
He's coming home in a week.

283
00:35:20.744 --> 00:35:23.031
(Distant rock music playing)

284
00:36:00.909 --> 00:36:05.324
You know, we're here celebrating,
but it's a shameful thing...

285
00:36:06.873 --> 00:36:08.830
What I did.

286
00:36:09.709 --> 00:36:13.418
And I have a lot of making up to do
to everyone.

287
00:36:19.302 --> 00:36:21.543
But second chances are rare.

288
00:36:22.514 --> 00:36:24.505
Right?

289
00:36:24.724 --> 00:36:27.307
And that's worth celebrating, right?

290
00:36:29.354 --> 00:36:31.971
So I want to make a toast...

291
00:36:32.107 --> 00:36:34.223
to that lady right there.

292
00:36:35.235 --> 00:36:38.318
Thanks for staying. I love you, Irene.

293
00:36:40.073 --> 00:36:42.314
Salud!

294
00:37:55.023 --> 00:37:57.185
Hey.

295
00:37:57.317 --> 00:37:59.024
Hi.

296
00:38:06.785 --> 00:38:09.277
Sorry about the noise.

297
00:38:12.332 --> 00:38:14.369
I was going to call the cops.

298
00:38:17.045 --> 00:38:19.082
I wish you would.

299
00:38:21.549 --> 00:38:24.211
Oh, he's getting heavier.

300
00:38:25.512 --> 00:38:28.129
- Hey. Done?
- I am.

301
00:38:29.307 --> 00:38:30.718
Hey!

302
00:38:32.727 --> 00:38:34.968
- How you doin'?
- Hi.

303
00:38:35.188 --> 00:38:37.680
This guy's been telling me a lot about you.

304
00:38:38.733 --> 00:38:42.317
Says you've been coming around,
helping out a lot?

305
00:38:42.445 --> 00:38:45.028
Yeah, helping out? Is that right?

306
00:38:46.699 --> 00:38:49.066
- Is that right?
- Mm-hm.

307
00:38:51.329 --> 00:38:54.321
That's very nice. That's nice of you.
Thank you.

308
00:38:54.457 --> 00:38:56.198
You're welcome.

309
00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:01.253
You drive for the movies?

310
00:39:02.465 --> 00:39:03.921
Yeah.

311
00:39:05.134 --> 00:39:07.671
- I can take that.
- No, no, I got it.

312
00:39:10.849 --> 00:39:12.886
Let Mommy talk to her friend.

313
00:39:14.477 --> 00:39:15.967
Come on.

314
00:39:34.539 --> 00:39:36.621
Have a good night.

315
00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:15.868
You're Shannon's buddy, right?

316
00:40:17.874 --> 00:40:19.911
We met last year.

317
00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:24.669
You drove me and my brother back
from Palm Springs.

318
00:40:27.717 --> 00:40:29.754
We hired another wheelman.

319
00:40:29.969 --> 00:40:34.258
I spent six months in jail.
My brother, he got himself killed.

320
00:40:38.186 --> 00:40:41.178
- I got this sweet job coming up.
- How about this?

321
00:40:41.397 --> 00:40:47.063
Shut your mouth or I'll kick your teeth
down your throat and I'll shut it for you.

322
00:40:54.243 --> 00:40:56.280
Nice seeing you again.

323
00:42:12.655 --> 00:42:14.771
<i>Come on. It's OK.</i>

324
00:42:14.991 --> 00:42:17.449
<i>Come here.</i>

325
00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:19.697
<i>Don't be scared.</i>

326
00:42:23.166 --> 00:42:25.248
<i>Don't tell Mommy, OK?</i>

327
00:42:27.879 --> 00:42:30.041
It's a secret between the boys.

328
00:42:31.758 --> 00:42:33.795
Oh, fuck me.

329
00:43:04.999 --> 00:43:07.036
(TV on)

330
00:43:33.194 --> 00:43:35.231
Who were they?

331
00:43:35.446 --> 00:43:39.110
(Laughs) What the fuck are you gonna do?
Beat 'em up for me?

332
00:43:39.242 --> 00:43:41.825
Huh, stunt guy?

333
00:43:42.036 --> 00:43:45.245
Why the fuck do you wanna know
who they are?

334
00:43:46.332 --> 00:43:47.332
Huh?

335
00:43:56.801 --> 00:44:01.045
There are some guys that want me to do
a job for 'em and I'm not gonna do it.

336
00:44:02.223 --> 00:44:04.681
That's who they are.

337
00:44:04.892 --> 00:44:06.929
What's the job?

338
00:44:07.061 --> 00:44:10.179
They want me to rob a pawn shop
in the Valley.

339
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:13.981
Why?

340
00:44:14.193 --> 00:44:19.404
Cos I owe 'em some protection money
from when I was inside. It's 2,000 bucks.

341
00:44:19.532 --> 00:44:22.445
But as soon as I got out,
oh, it's 5,000 bucks.

342
00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:25.743
No, actually, it's 10,000 dollars,
20,000 dollars.

343
00:44:25.955 --> 00:44:28.947
Tomorrow, I don't know
what the fuck it's gonna be!

344
00:44:31.043 --> 00:44:33.080
What are you gonna do?

345
00:44:33.296 --> 00:44:35.708
That's a really good question.

346
00:44:38.176 --> 00:44:42.090
They said they were gonna come
after BENICIO and Irene next.

347
00:45:03.826 --> 00:45:05.863
Are you OK?

348
00:45:06.996 --> 00:45:09.033
You want something to drink?

349
00:45:12.752 --> 00:45:14.789
What's that you got there?

350
00:45:16.589 --> 00:45:18.455
Can I see?

351
00:45:31.437 --> 00:45:34.020
One of those men gave you that?

352
00:45:34.232 --> 00:45:35.688
Mm-hm.

353
00:45:35.816 --> 00:45:37.898
He told me not to lose it.

354
00:45:42.823 --> 00:45:45.064
You want me to keep that for you?

355
00:45:45.284 --> 00:45:46.284
OK.

356
00:46:11.477 --> 00:46:13.514
How's Benice?

357
00:46:13.646 --> 00:46:15.102
Good.

358
00:46:18.734 --> 00:46:21.066
- You just saying that?
- No.

359
00:46:24.532 --> 00:46:26.569
What do you mean?

360
00:46:28.995 --> 00:46:34.205
I saw that Standard...
was in an accident?

361
00:46:34.417 --> 00:46:35.748
Yeah.

362
00:46:39.088 --> 00:46:41.125
What happened?

363
00:46:44.593 --> 00:46:47.255
He got beat up.

364
00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:48.677
Mm-hm.

365
00:46:50.391 --> 00:46:51.802
Why?

366
00:46:53.019 --> 00:46:55.056
Just drunk kids.

367
00:47:06.407 --> 00:47:08.489
You should come over.

368
00:47:11.329 --> 00:47:13.866
You should come and see him.

369
00:47:20.296 --> 00:47:24.415
You want to hear a story? Do you want
to hear how Mommy and me met?

370
00:47:24.633 --> 00:47:26.874
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

371
00:47:27.094 --> 00:47:28.209
OK.

372
00:47:29.555 --> 00:47:31.546
We were at a party.

373
00:47:31.766 --> 00:47:33.803
- She was 19 years old.
- 17.

374
00:47:34.018 --> 00:47:35.884
- You weren't 17?
- I was.

375
00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:38.637
- Wow! So it was illegal?
- Yeah.

376
00:47:40.649 --> 00:47:46.361
All right. So I illegally walked over
to a 17-year-old girl.

377
00:47:46.572 --> 00:47:49.485
And I walk up and I say, "Hello, miss.

378
00:47:50.785 --> 00:47:52.822
"What is your name?"

379
00:47:53.037 --> 00:47:58.203
And she doesn't say anything. Then I said,
"Well, my name is Standard Gabriel.“

380
00:47:59.627 --> 00:48:01.664
Then what did you say?

381
00:48:05.966 --> 00:48:07.798
I said...

382
00:48:08.844 --> 00:48:11.051
"Where is the de-luxe version?"

383
00:48:11.263 --> 00:48:14.005
(Standard laughs)

384
00:48:16.519 --> 00:48:18.851
She's good, man.

385
00:48:18.979 --> 00:48:20.595
Sharp.

386
00:48:20.815 --> 00:48:23.056
Oh, man, it killed me.

387
00:48:26.612 --> 00:48:28.979
Then a year later, you popped out, man.

388
00:48:35.496 --> 00:48:37.954
It was the best day of my life.

389
00:49:12.158 --> 00:49:14.240
(Turns ignition on)

390
00:49:21.876 --> 00:49:24.117
<i>If I drive for you, you get your money.</i>

391
00:49:24.253 --> 00:49:26.836
You tell me where we start,
where we're going,

392
00:49:27.047 --> 00:49:30.961
where we're going afterwards.
I give you five minutes when we get there.

393
00:49:31.177 --> 00:49:34.260
Anything happens in that five minutes
and I'm yours.

394
00:49:34.472 --> 00:49:37.965
Anything a minute either side of that
and you're on your own.

395
00:49:38.184 --> 00:49:43.145
I don't sit in while you're running
it down. I don't carry a gun. I drive.

396
00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:46.807
You look like you're hard to work with.

397
00:49:47.026 --> 00:49:51.270
- Not if we understand each other.
- What's to understand?

398
00:49:51.405 --> 00:49:53.487
I can't do this thing alone.

399
00:49:53.699 --> 00:49:56.191
- You got Blanche.
- Come on, man.

400
00:49:58.329 --> 00:50:00.696
She's beautiful. Look at her.

401
00:50:02.666 --> 00:50:05.784
What the fuck
you rollin' your eyes at for?

402
00:50:07.254 --> 00:50:09.495
Get the fuck out of here. Get up!

403
00:50:09.715 --> 00:50:13.629
Standard, take her with you
and go get her a fucking Coke!

404
00:50:19.350 --> 00:50:21.341
OK, here's the deal.

405
00:50:23.062 --> 00:50:25.099
This much for Blanche...

406
00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:29.308
This much for that asshole,
minus what he owes me.

407
00:50:30.945 --> 00:50:33.232
And this much... for you.

408
00:50:37.034 --> 00:50:39.071
You still interested?

409
00:50:41.121 --> 00:50:44.204
Good. Anything else?

410
00:50:44.333 --> 00:50:47.325
When you get your money, his debt's paid.

411
00:50:48.587 --> 00:50:52.672
He's out for good
and you never go near his family again.

412
00:50:53.759 --> 00:50:55.750
You understand?

413
00:50:59.848 --> 00:51:03.216
I'm here with my family
and my new friend.

414
00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:05.601
And...

415
00:51:07.022 --> 00:51:09.059
Toast to the future.

416
00:51:10.651 --> 00:51:12.688
To our future.

417
00:51:32.464 --> 00:51:33.829
Hey.

418
00:51:37.303 --> 00:51:39.544
I'll see you in five minutes.

419
00:51:44.727 --> 00:51:46.593
I'll see you in four.

420
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.082
(Car approaching)

421
00:54:01.822 --> 00:54:03.654
(Gunshot)

422
00:54:03.782 --> 00:54:05.193
(Gasps)

423
00:54:14.668 --> 00:54:16.284
(Gunshots)

424
00:54:50.704 --> 00:54:51.785
Shit!

425
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:56.957
Oh, my God!

426
00:54:59.755 --> 00:55:01.917
(Horn blares)

427
00:55:02.049 --> 00:55:03.710
God!

428
00:55:07.262 --> 00:55:09.344
(Horn blares)

429
00:55:26.323 --> 00:55:27.358
Oh!

430
00:56:25.465 --> 00:56:29.424
How much did Cook say
we were gonna get?

431
00:56:31.346 --> 00:56:33.383
Forty grand.

432
00:56:41.315 --> 00:56:43.306
Stay here.

433
00:56:49.323 --> 00:56:51.940
(Phone keypad beeps)

434
00:56:54.453 --> 00:56:56.911
(Murmur of police radios)

435
00:57:01.585 --> 00:57:05.704
<i>(Woman) When was the last time
you saw your husband?</i>

436
00:57:08.258 --> 00:57:10.670
<i>Can you answer the question?</i>

437
00:57:11.762 --> 00:57:13.378
<i>Ma'am?</i>

438
00:57:16.767 --> 00:57:19.054
(Phone ringing)

439
00:57:20.145 --> 00:57:21.145
<i>Hello?</i>

440
00:57:21.355 --> 00:57:23.596
BENICIO? Is that you?

441
00:57:23.857 --> 00:57:24.857
<i>Yeah.</i>

442
00:57:25.025 --> 00:57:27.687
- Hey.
<i>- Uhh... hi.</i>

443
00:57:27.945 --> 00:57:29.982
Is your mother there?

444
00:57:30.155 --> 00:57:33.898
<i>Uh, she's sitting down
talking to the police.</i>

445
00:57:34.117 --> 00:57:38.076
OK, just tell her
I'm going to call her back, OK?

446
00:57:38.205 --> 00:57:40.162
OK. Bye.

447
00:57:42.918 --> 00:57:46.627
<i>In related news,
an attempted robbery turned tragic today</i>

448
00:57:46.797 --> 00:57:50.961
<i>when the owner of a pawn shop
opened fire on an intruder, who died.</i>

449
00:57:51.176 --> 00:57:55.716
<i>He has been identified as Standard Gabriel
of Echo Park, Los Angeles.</i>

450
00:57:55.973 --> 00:57:59.887
<i>Other details are unclear,
but the owner told reporters</i>

451
00:58:00.102 --> 00:58:03.311
<i>that Gabriel acted alone
and no money had been stolen.</i>

452
00:58:03.438 --> 00:58:07.853
<i>In other news,
four high school athletes were arrested...</i>

453
00:58:27.337 --> 00:58:30.329
If he saw you take the money

454
00:58:30.465 --> 00:58:33.002
and he saw you get in the car,

455
00:58:34.136 --> 00:58:36.719
then why didn't he say anything?

456
00:58:38.348 --> 00:58:40.339
I've no idea.

457
00:58:51.319 --> 00:58:55.404
Did you have any idea
there would be a second car?

458
00:58:59.453 --> 00:59:01.945
I already told you everything.

459
00:59:07.169 --> 00:59:11.128
Now you just got
a little boy's father killed.

460
00:59:11.298 --> 00:59:15.587
And you almost got us killed.
And now you're lying to me.

461
00:59:15.719 --> 00:59:17.710
So how about this?

462
00:59:19.014 --> 00:59:23.554
From now on, every word
out of your mouth is the truth.

463
00:59:23.769 --> 00:59:25.055
(Cries)

464
00:59:25.187 --> 00:59:27.428
Or I'm going to hurt you.

465
00:59:28.523 --> 00:59:30.764
Do you understand?

466
00:59:30.901 --> 00:59:33.359
Now what did Cook tell you?

467
00:59:34.446 --> 00:59:37.984
He said there'd be another car
to hold us up,

468
00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:43.491
but he didn't say anything about
all this money or anyone getting killed.

469
00:59:43.622 --> 00:59:46.239
You were going to rip us off?

470
00:59:52.798 --> 00:59:55.130
What's his real name?

471
00:59:55.258 --> 00:59:57.966
He says it's Chris,
but I just call him Cook.

472
01:00:02.015 --> 01:00:05.508
You're going to take me to him.
Right now.

473
01:00:07.562 --> 01:00:10.645
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

474
01:00:30.919 --> 01:00:32.535
(Sobs)

475
01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:47.387
(Phone vibrates)

476
01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:45.448
Ungh!

477
01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:43.040
(Phone rings)

478
01:03:07.534 --> 01:03:09.616
Easy, easy.

479
01:03:13.748 --> 01:03:14.829
Ah.

480
01:03:23.258 --> 01:03:25.841
What did you do with the cash?

481
01:03:27.762 --> 01:03:32.256
- Cos I could keep it safe for you...
- Will you just stop?

482
01:03:37.605 --> 01:03:40.267
This guy Cook. Does he have a real name?

483
01:03:41.568 --> 01:03:42.979
Chris.

484
01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:45.686
Maybe.

485
01:03:47.782 --> 01:03:50.740
I'll ask Bernie, see if he knows him.

486
01:03:52.454 --> 01:03:57.540
Jeez, I can't stop thinking about
what we could do with all that dough.

487
01:03:57.667 --> 01:04:00.079
- Will you just stop?
- All right.

488
01:04:00.337 --> 01:04:02.064
A lot of guys mess around
with married women,

489
01:04:02.088 --> 01:04:04.204
but you're the only one I know
who robs a joint

490
01:04:04.299 --> 01:04:07.542
just to pay back the husband. Crazy.

491
01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:10.928
Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it.

492
01:04:42.504 --> 01:04:46.623
- Where's Cook?
- He's in the dressing room.

493
01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:50.384
- Where's that?
- It's over there.

494
01:05:04.651 --> 01:05:06.858
Aargh! Aaargh!

495
01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:08.606
<i>Ram!</i>

496
01:05:20.625 --> 01:05:23.617
Whose money do I have?

497
01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:26.085
Don't worry. They're gonna come get it.

498
01:05:26.214 --> 01:05:28.000
No, no...!

499
01:05:28.258 --> 01:05:31.922
- Call them.
- Somebody call Nino!

500
01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:45.897
Do you remember this?

501
01:05:51.364 --> 01:05:52.820
(Gags)

502
01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:06.498
(Phone ringing)

503
01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:10.539
<i>Hello?</i>

504
01:06:10.758 --> 01:06:12.499
Nino?

505
01:06:12.719 --> 01:06:16.838
<i>No, sorry, pal. Why don't you
call back later? We're closed.</i>

506
01:06:17.015 --> 01:06:20.849
I think Nino would be upset
that you made him wait.

507
01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:23.427
<i>Can I ask what this is about?</i>

508
01:06:23.688 --> 01:06:27.397
- I have something of his.
<i>- And that would be?</i>

509
01:06:27.525 --> 01:06:29.641
A million dollars.

510
01:06:31.279 --> 01:06:33.361
<i>Please hold.</i>

511
01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:44.452
<i>(Nino) You got something
that fucking belongs to me?</i>

512
01:06:47.837 --> 01:06:50.044
It seems that way.

513
01:06:51.799 --> 01:06:54.166
And you're calling me?

514
01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:57.047
Why?

515
01:06:57.263 --> 01:06:59.880
You expect me to buy my own shit back?

516
01:07:00.141 --> 01:07:02.348
<i>I'm not selling it.</i>

517
01:07:02.477 --> 01:07:07.597
I'm going to give you a time and a place
and you'll come and get it. Understand?

518
01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:11.642
<i>And what do you get out of it?</i>

519
01:07:12.737 --> 01:07:15.695
Just that. Out of it.

520
01:07:16.783 --> 01:07:19.400
<i>And your partners are happy with that?</i>

521
01:07:21.162 --> 01:07:23.449
I don't have any partners.

522
01:07:24.499 --> 01:07:27.912
You discuss this with anybody else?

523
01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:31.332
<i>No, just you.</i>

524
01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:35.002
You're not very good at this, are you?

525
01:07:37.679 --> 01:07:39.545
(Hangs up)

526
01:07:46.187 --> 01:07:48.804
Go check out who this fucking guy is.

527
01:08:09.752 --> 01:08:11.789
(Knock at door)

528
01:08:27.145 --> 01:08:29.728
Can I talk to you for a minute?

529
01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:33.482
Can't talk. I have to go.

530
01:08:35.653 --> 01:08:38.315
Can I just walk with you for...?

531
01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:40.147
Yeah.

532
01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:01.593
I have to tell you something.

533
01:09:07.685 --> 01:09:10.143
Standard was into some...

534
01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:14.056
guys in prison for a lot of money.

535
01:09:16.653 --> 01:09:20.772
And they were going to hurt you
and BENICIO if he didn't pay it.

536
01:09:23.117 --> 01:09:25.700
He asked me for my help.

537
01:09:28.539 --> 01:09:30.997
Everything went wrong.

538
01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:36.161
I'm sorry.

539
01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:42.800
I've still got the money.

540
01:09:46.891 --> 01:09:49.474
You could have it if you wanted to.

541
01:09:51.062 --> 01:09:53.474
You could take BENICIO and...

542
01:10:05.243 --> 01:10:08.952
I just thought
you could get out of here if you wanted.

543
01:10:11.499 --> 01:10:13.740
I could come with you.

544
01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:19.788
I could look out for you.

545
01:10:20.007 --> 01:10:22.044
(Door opens)

546
01:10:24.095 --> 01:10:25.756
Sorry.

547
01:10:25.972 --> 01:10:27.963
Wrong floor.

548
01:13:50.468 --> 01:13:53.005
They came to my apartment, Shannon.

549
01:13:54.096 --> 01:13:56.258
How do they know where I live?

550
01:13:58.643 --> 01:14:02.728
I told you I was gonna call Bernie.
I just wanted him to know

551
01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:07.649
that you're not interested in the money.
That you just did it for the girl.

552
01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:10.394
What did you say?

553
01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:15.319
- What did you fucking say about Irene?
- Calm down!

554
01:14:15.534 --> 01:14:19.653
- You told them about Irene!
- Calm down, kid! Calm down.

555
01:14:19.872 --> 01:14:24.617
- I should fucking kill you!
- Listen, I just wanted him to know

556
01:14:24.835 --> 01:14:29.375
that as soon as you returned the money,
that was the end of it. That's all.

557
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:32.252
How was I supposed to know that?!

558
01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:35.130
OK? Let me just talk to Bernie.

559
01:14:35.346 --> 01:14:39.465
- OK?
- Why have you got to fuck everything up?

560
01:14:39.684 --> 01:14:43.803
How was I supposed to know
everything led to Nino?!

561
01:14:48.234 --> 01:14:52.774
They're going to come looking for me
and they're going to come for you.

562
01:14:52.989 --> 01:14:55.026
Do you understand?

563
01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:58.734
You gotta get out of here
and you gotta get out now.

564
01:14:58.953 --> 01:15:01.820
- Listen to me, Shannon.
- Oh, God...

565
01:15:02.039 --> 01:15:06.579
Listen. You get out of here
and you never fucking come back.

566
01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:09.707
You never come back.

567
01:15:15.136 --> 01:15:17.468
What are you gonna do?

568
01:15:33.904 --> 01:15:36.362
I already gave you my advice.

569
01:15:36.574 --> 01:15:40.033
You should have taken the money
and left the guy alone.

570
01:15:40.244 --> 01:15:44.579
- It's not that simple, Bernie.
- Not now it's bounced up in your face!

571
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:47.452
I owe you this guy. I'll get rid of him.

572
01:15:47.585 --> 01:15:52.036
Shut the fuck up,
you fucking monkey.

573
01:15:52.256 --> 01:15:56.375
The money belongs to some half-assed
wiseguy out of Philly.

574
01:15:56.594 --> 01:16:00.713
I got tipped off he was stashing
a million bucks in a pawn shop.

575
01:16:00.931 --> 01:16:03.889
He was gonna set up a rival operation.

576
01:16:04.018 --> 01:16:06.760
So you stole from the East Coast mob?

577
01:16:06.979 --> 01:16:12.440
No, I stole from some jumped-up punk
who was trying to step on our action.

578
01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:17.062
Then why didn't you come to me
before you set up this dummy robbery?

579
01:16:17.281 --> 01:16:21.240
- Before you hire this piece of shit.
- This is off to the side.

580
01:16:21.368 --> 01:16:25.453
- I didn't want to involve you.
- Well, I'm involved now!

581
01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:28.781
I'm gonna tell you something.

582
01:16:29.001 --> 01:16:30.742
Anybody,

583
01:16:30.961 --> 01:16:36.297
anybody finds out you stole
from the family, we're both dead.

584
01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:38.837
What fucking family?!

585
01:16:39.053 --> 01:16:41.841
The family who still
calls me a fuckin' kike?

586
01:16:42.056 --> 01:16:43.967
To my face!

587
01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:50.554
I'm 59 years old, Bernie! They still
pinch my cheek like I'm some fucking kid!

588
01:16:52.108 --> 01:16:56.193
- Family.
- The money always flows up, Izzy.

589
01:16:56.403 --> 01:16:58.815
You know that.

590
01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:01.781
That's why this driver's gotta go, Bernie.

591
01:17:02.868 --> 01:17:06.202
Gotta go. And your pal, Shannon.

592
01:17:06.330 --> 01:17:10.824
These are the only two guys
who can tie me to this robbery.

593
01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:33.433
Aaaargh!

594
01:17:49.123 --> 01:17:52.036
Now it's your turn to clean up after me.

595
01:18:55.356 --> 01:18:57.893
All these priceless cars.

596
01:18:58.108 --> 01:19:00.770
One would think you'd have better locks.

597
01:19:02.821 --> 01:19:08.112
- My door's always open to you.
- Going somewhere?

598
01:19:09.245 --> 01:19:10.861
Ah...

599
01:19:13.249 --> 01:19:18.244
- Thinking about it.
- I'm looking for your driver.

600
01:19:20.381 --> 01:19:23.169
You break in here, I figure it's bad news.

601
01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:25.883
No, Shannon. It's bad luck.

602
01:19:27.263 --> 01:19:32.975
Two thousand heists a year in this city,
he has to pick the wrong one.

603
01:19:33.102 --> 01:19:37.812
- He tried to put it right.
- He picked the wrong guy for that, too.

604
01:19:38.023 --> 01:19:42.483
My partner is a belligerent asshole
with his back against the wall.

605
01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:44.568
Right now, so am I.

606
01:19:45.656 --> 01:19:48.444
If I don't set this
straight, I'm in big trouble.

607
01:19:51.245 --> 01:19:53.907
Any idea where he might be?

608
01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:58.290
Mexico.

609
01:19:58.502 --> 01:20:01.460
Or maybe it was Belize.

610
01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.882
Really?

611
01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:15.474
I was getting excited
about this whole thing.

612
01:20:15.686 --> 01:20:17.927
My name on a car!

613
01:20:18.147 --> 01:20:21.139
I mean, look how beautiful!

614
01:20:21.275 --> 01:20:23.858
I wanted to see my name on this thing.

615
01:20:25.404 --> 01:20:29.523
I think we would have
made a go at this business.

616
01:20:44.089 --> 01:20:47.207
- Ah!
- Don't worry. Don't worry, that's it.

617
01:20:47.343 --> 01:20:51.587
It's done. There's no pain.
It's over, it's over.

618
01:25:21.199 --> 01:25:23.315
(Engine revs)

619
01:25:29.458 --> 01:25:31.870
What the fuck was that?

620
01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:06.817
- Let's get outta here.
- Yeah.

621
01:26:09.498 --> 01:26:11.535
(Engine revs)

622
01:26:32.854 --> 01:26:34.811
(Door alarm pings)

623
01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:48.825
(Breathes heavily)

624
01:28:08.658 --> 01:28:10.695
<i>(Bernie) Hello?</i>

625
01:28:10.911 --> 01:28:15.451
You know the story
about the scorpion and the frog?

626
01:28:17.209 --> 01:28:21.328
Your friend Nino didn't make it
across the river.

627
01:28:22.422 --> 01:28:25.210
<i>I think this has gone on long enough.</i>

628
01:28:26.551 --> 01:28:29.418
You see any reason for it to continue?

629
01:28:30.514 --> 01:28:32.972
What do you say we meet?

630
01:28:35.352 --> 01:28:37.093
<i>Why?</i>

631
01:28:38.688 --> 01:28:43.649
Well, you, me and your girlfriend
are the only players left.

632
01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:46.318
How's that for a reason?

633
01:28:48.490 --> 01:28:50.106
When?

634
01:28:50.325 --> 01:28:54.114
<i>Tomorrow.
There's a place on Sherman Way.</i>

635
01:28:54.329 --> 01:28:58.448
<i>It's a restaurant called The Great Wall.
Do you know it?</i>

636
01:29:25.819 --> 01:29:28.277
<i>(Driver) Can I talk to you?</i>

637
01:29:29.781 --> 01:29:32.239
<i>I won't keep you long.</i>

638
01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:41.620
<i>I have to go somewhere
and I don't think I can come back.</i>

639
01:29:45.213 --> 01:29:47.671
<i>But I just wanted you to know</i>

640
01:29:47.883 --> 01:29:50.545
<i>getting to be around you and BENICIO,</i>

641
01:29:52.679 --> 01:29:56.172
<i>it was the best thing
that ever happened to me.</i>

642
01:30:47.567 --> 01:30:50.434
Did you bring the money?

643
01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:58.237
Here's what I'm prepared to offer.

644
01:30:58.453 --> 01:31:01.070
You give me the money, the girl is safe.

645
01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:05.408
Forever. Nobody knows about her.
She's off the map.

646
01:31:06.962 --> 01:31:09.545
I can't offer you the same.

647
01:31:10.465 --> 01:31:12.923
So this is what I would suggest.

648
01:31:13.134 --> 01:31:16.001
We conclude our deal, we'll shake hands.

649
01:31:16.221 --> 01:31:18.838
You start the rest of your life.

650
01:31:21.476 --> 01:31:25.845
Any dreams you have,
or plans, or hopes for your future,

651
01:31:26.064 --> 01:31:29.557
I think you're gonna have to
put that on hold.

652
01:31:29.776 --> 01:31:33.485
For the rest of your life,
you'll be looking over your shoulder.

653
01:31:33.697 --> 01:31:38.032
I'm just telling you this
because I want you to know the truth.

654
01:31:38.243 --> 01:31:40.280
But the girl is safe.

655
01:32:00.557 --> 01:32:02.889
Where's the money now?

656
01:32:03.018 --> 01:32:05.009
It's in the car.

657
01:32:13.445 --> 01:32:15.277
Come on.

658
01:32:21.828 --> 01:32:23.569
Ungh!
