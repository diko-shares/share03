00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:33.158
Gather around and allow me
to tell you the story of stories,

2
00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:37.370
the final adventure, the tale of it all.

3
00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:42.876
It begins, like all great stories do,
a long, long time ago...

4
00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:49.132
<i>...as a war between mankind
and magic raged.</i>

5
00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.593
<i>A conflict between humans,</i>

6
00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:54.387
<i>allied with good-hearted,
peace-seeking trolls,</i>

7
00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:56.973
<i>and the relentless evil trolls</i>

8
00:00:57.056 --> 00:00:58.683
<i>who would see them destroyed.</i>

9
00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:05.940
<i>The mightiest wizard of all,
Merlin Ambrosius,</i>

10
00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:09.778
<i>sought to maintain the balance
by forging a powerful weapon,</i>

11
00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:13.740
<i>the Trollhunter Amulet.</i>

12
00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:20.789
<i>Millennia passed,
and trollkind settled in the shadows,</i>

13
00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:25.919
<i>beneath the human world,
in the quiet hamlet of Arcadia Oaks.</i>

14
00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:29.172
<i>In this very land,
the Trollhunter, Kanjigar,</i>

15
00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:30.757
<i>was felled in battle</i>

16
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.842
<i>by an evil troll.</i>

17
00:01:34.552 --> 00:01:37.180
<i>And for the first time
since its creation,</i>

18
00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:40.391
<i>Merlin's amulet called to a human.</i>

19
00:01:44.354 --> 00:01:46.439
<i>At first glance, an unremarkable one.</i>

20
00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:50.735
<i>My name is James Lake, Jr.</i>

21
00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.488
<i>It's not easy being the Trollhunter.</i>

22
00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:58.076
<i>It's even harder
being the first human Trollhunter.</i>

23
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.872
<i>Fortunately, I had my friends to help.
Friends from Arcadia.</i>

24
00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:05.875
<i>And a little further away.</i>

25
00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:12.882
<i>Uh, heh, when I said friends,
I might have been exaggerating.</i>

26
00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.968
- Creep...
- Slayerz.

27
00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:25.061
<i>Although we saved Arcadia
and the world numerous times...</i>

28
00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:30.817
<i>The Trollhunter could not save himself.</i>

29
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.698
<i>Tragically, Master Jim
was felled by dark magic.</i>

30
00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:39.367
<i>The Trollhunter Amulet was destroyed.</i>

31
00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:46.749
<i>Malevolent wizards
known as the Arcane Order saw to that.</i>

32
00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:50.295
<i>Then, much to everyone's surprise,</i>

33
00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:54.674
<i>one of the Arcane Order
turned to the side of good.</i>

34
00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:58.303
<i>The other two
are on the hunt for her.</i>

35
00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:02.891
<i>You see, they wanna use something
called the Genesis Seals to...</i>

36
00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:05.476
<i>Well, I don't know what the seals do,</i>

37
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.562
<i>but you gotta figure it's bad.</i>

38
00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:11.983
<i>The point is, the world has
never been in greater danger,</i>

39
00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:14.319
<i>or needed the Trollhunter more.</i>

40
00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:19.616
But without the Amulet,
am I still the Trollhunter?

41
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:28.416
<i>This train is scheduled for maintenance.</i>

42
00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:30.585
<i>The next train will be arriving shortly.</i>

43
00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:02.825
- This is a bad idea.
- No.

44
00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:06.621
No more running, Douxie.

45
00:04:07.705 --> 00:04:09.457
No more running.

46
00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:17.090
Can you feel it too, Nari?

47
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:19.550
They're here.

48
00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.267
Here we go.

49
00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:39.779
Nari.

50
00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:42.657
Nari...

51
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.286
We have tracked you down
and we are bringing you back.

52
00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:48.913
<i>Causa crepitus.</i>

53
00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:52.917
<i>Magna torna tuess.</i>

54
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.137
Nari, you've been a naughty girl.

55
00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:08.599
You are coming back with us.

56
00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:19.944
You cannot hide from us forever.

57
00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:21.821
Who said we were hiding?

58
00:05:25.366 --> 00:05:27.243
Trollhunter.

59
00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:31.289
Nope. Now I hunt wizards.

60
00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:36.294
Cutting it a bit close.

61
00:05:36.377 --> 00:05:40.673
You try opening a shadow portal
on a subway going 55 miles an hour.

62
00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:49.389
What the...?

63
00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:57.190
Well, that... was close.

64
00:06:00.401 --> 00:06:02.070
Go. Remember the plan.

65
00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:03.153
Got it.

66
00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.166
- Thanks, Archie.
- Mm, cat.

67
00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:17.335
Later. We've gotta stop this train.

68
00:06:17.418 --> 00:06:18.669
What do you mean, later?

69
00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:22.423
Stink-Man, Creepslayer, this is Warhammer.
On track to stop the wagon.

70
00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:24.383
<i>- Do you copy?</i>
- Stink-Man reads you.

71
00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:27.887
And recalls asking
for a less offensive codename.

72
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.515
Power her up.
They're about to be right under us.

73
00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:33.017
Akiridion technology.

74
00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:34.936
When they stop below us,

75
00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:37.688
trifurcate radiation
will nullify all magic.

76
00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:39.774
That should put a stop to the wizards.

77
00:06:39.857 --> 00:06:42.318
Uh, radiation?
This is... This is safe, right?

78
00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:44.570
Yeah, safe-ish.

79
00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:47.573
- When you approach us, hit the brakes.
<i>- Got it.</i>

80
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.497
Whoa, wingman, don't be that guy
who underestimates his strength,

81
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.834
breaks the thing,
and makes the situation worse.

82
00:06:57.917 --> 00:06:59.252
I'll do it.

83
00:07:05.007 --> 00:07:07.927
Come on, come on. You got it. You got it.

84
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.305
I made the situation worse.

85
00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.474
- They're almost under us.
- I'm ready.

86
00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:18.813
On my count. Five, four, three, two, one.

87
00:07:21.357 --> 00:07:23.609
Whoa, they didn't even slow down.

88
00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:24.527
I know.

89
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.779
We'll have to do it on the move.

90
00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:31.993
Hey, watch it!

91
00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:37.957
- Where's the ray? Why didn't we stop?
- We haven't slowed down.

92
00:07:47.675 --> 00:07:49.385
Jim!

93
00:07:55.766 --> 00:07:56.976
We're next to them.

94
00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:01.731
And now they're above us.

95
00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:04.358
- Quick, open the taco hatch.
- Got it.

96
00:08:17.246 --> 00:08:19.582
We're under them. Now.

97
00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:26.297
It's working.

98
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.508
Their magic's gone.

99
00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:34.972
Watch it.

100
00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:45.358
Get off tracks!

101
00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:00.498
No!

102
00:09:05.002 --> 00:09:06.212
And now...

103
00:09:07.838 --> 00:09:12.843
it is time
for the once-mighty Trollhunter to die.

104
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.557
Without your amulet,

105
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.978
you are nothing
but a frightened little boy.

106
00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:26.065
Oh, my... Jim!

107
00:09:26.148 --> 00:09:29.235
Trollhunter is down. Trollhunter is down.

108
00:09:29.318 --> 00:09:31.862
He should've never gone without armor.

109
00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:34.782
You follow a leader
through the highs and the lows.

110
00:09:34.865 --> 00:09:36.492
This is what low looks like.

111
00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:38.828
- Archie, tell Claire.
- Got it.

112
00:09:41.497 --> 00:09:42.582
Jim's been hurt.

113
00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:44.584
Tell them to keep him safe.

114
00:09:44.667 --> 00:09:48.379
Slow down!

115
00:09:48.462 --> 00:09:49.462
Can you stop it?

116
00:09:49.505 --> 00:09:51.257
Too fast.

117
00:09:53.342 --> 00:09:55.094
We'll never make that turn.

118
00:09:55.177 --> 00:09:59.056
We need to work together.

119
00:10:04.895 --> 00:10:08.149
Uh, you might want to know,
we're all going to die.

120
00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:24.457
Oh, no. Come on.

121
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.292
Come on. Come on. Come on.

122
00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:36.427
<i>I am Gun Ro...</i>

123
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.846
<i>Robot.</i>

124
00:10:48.522 --> 00:10:50.900
Huh.

125
00:10:51.942 --> 00:10:54.070
- You okay?
- I don't know.

126
00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:56.405
Where's Nari?

127
00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:58.866
Check out those costumes.

128
00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:02.912
Douxie.

129
00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:09.543
Nari.

130
00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:11.837
No, you can't have her.

131
00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:14.423
And who's going to stop us?

132
00:11:16.008 --> 00:11:19.762
- Nari.
- No! No!

133
00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:26.560
I've got you.

134
00:11:27.144 --> 00:11:29.397
Claire, can you get her out of here?

135
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.357
I'm trying.

136
00:11:33.734 --> 00:11:34.735
Hey, get back.

137
00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:36.654
Everyone, back up.

138
00:11:36.737 --> 00:11:38.114
You're not helping.

139
00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:39.532
Back up.

140
00:11:40.866 --> 00:11:42.201
What is that?

141
00:11:45.746 --> 00:11:48.791
Let go, or the humans perish.

142
00:11:48.874 --> 00:11:51.627
And so do your friends.

143
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.129
Hang in there, buddy.

144
00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.882
Come on! Come on! Come on!

145
00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:58.551
Douxie, let go.

146
00:11:58.634 --> 00:12:00.511
We can't let them take Nari.

147
00:12:00.594 --> 00:12:02.430
Come on. Come on.

148
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.851
But they can take me.

149
00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.073
Dispatch,
you are not gonna believe this.

150
00:12:27.621 --> 00:12:30.040
Douxie, I couldn't protect Nari.

151
00:12:30.124 --> 00:12:31.125
I'm sorry.

152
00:12:33.002 --> 00:12:34.753
Yes, you did.

153
00:12:34.837 --> 00:12:37.506
- They switched places?
- Awesomesauce.

154
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.216
Put your hands up now!

155
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.552
- You're under arrest.
- What happened?

156
00:12:42.553 --> 00:12:43.804
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

157
00:12:44.513 --> 00:12:46.348
Move to the middle.

158
00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:47.808
- Hmph.
- Pose.

159
00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:49.310
Not awesomesauce.

160
00:12:49.393 --> 00:12:50.436
Next!

161
00:12:50.936 --> 00:12:51.936
Smile.

162
00:12:52.521 --> 00:12:53.355
Or not.

163
00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:56.942
Oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Okay.

164
00:12:57.026 --> 00:13:00.488
No! What the...? Oh, come on.

165
00:13:00.571 --> 00:13:02.490
So you're not gonna talk?

166
00:13:07.036 --> 00:13:08.204
Guess not.

167
00:13:08.287 --> 00:13:10.873
Uh, I can see you there.

168
00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:17.338
Sorry, but you'll find
that none of us will talk.

169
00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:19.590
Okay, check this out.

170
00:13:19.673 --> 00:13:24.637
There are trolls and wizards and aliens,
and the aliens have robots.

171
00:13:25.721 --> 00:13:26.764
Toby said all that?

172
00:13:26.847 --> 00:13:29.391
Jimbo, my best friend,
used to be the Trollhunter.

173
00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:31.435
We found this amulet forged by Merlin,

174
00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:35.231
but it broke, which is a huge bummer,
because now he's lost his mojo.

175
00:13:35.314 --> 00:13:37.691
I got a Warhammer out of the deal,

176
00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:40.444
but Claire, she can make shadow portals.

177
00:13:41.278 --> 00:13:43.113
He said that too?

178
00:13:43.197 --> 00:13:45.574
So why don't you just portal
out of here?

179
00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:47.701
Um, I'm kind of spent.

180
00:13:48.285 --> 00:13:50.913
So there are these three super wizards,

181
00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.749
who created everything in the universe.

182
00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:56.585
That's the look
my science teacher gave us.

183
00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:59.922
Nari's naughty by nature,
Skrael's got that cool ice,

184
00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:02.508
and Bellroc, ooh, watch out for that fire.

185
00:14:02.591 --> 00:14:06.470
And I think they're mad
because we screwed up the planet.

186
00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:09.265
They stole these Genesis Seals
that lock away evil.

187
00:14:09.348 --> 00:14:12.768
Once the wizards get their powers together
in one place, look out,

188
00:14:12.851 --> 00:14:15.187
end of time.

189
00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:19.358
Woo!

190
00:14:21.318 --> 00:14:22.236
Woo!

191
00:14:24.446 --> 00:14:29.076
- Whoa. How you doing that?
- Nature is a melody the Earth can hear.

192
00:14:29.159 --> 00:14:31.787
This is real. We're your only chance.

193
00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:34.248
You can stop doing that.
Stop it!

194
00:14:34.331 --> 00:14:35.749
Woo!

195
00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:38.168
Woo!

196
00:14:39.086 --> 00:14:40.963
Woo!

197
00:14:41.046 --> 00:14:43.340
At least you're not weird, kitty.

198
00:14:43.424 --> 00:14:44.842
Thank you.

199
00:14:52.057 --> 00:14:53.559
You can't go in there.

200
00:14:53.642 --> 00:14:54.727
Back off, human.

201
00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:56.937
Sure thing, talking kitty.

202
00:14:57.021 --> 00:15:00.065
I'm Agent Tarron.
I'm here to take custody of the prisoners.

203
00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:01.317
On whose authority?

204
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.652
- Area 49B.
- FBI, CIA.

205
00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:05.321
- MIA.
- NSA. SCC.

206
00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:06.739
And your mom.

207
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.617
- My mom or his?
- Huh?

208
00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.952
You kids,
you're in a lot of trouble.

209
00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:13.203
We're very sorry.

210
00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:15.247
Nature is mother to us all.

211
00:15:15.331 --> 00:15:17.416
You can say that again, again, again...

212
00:15:17.499 --> 00:15:19.543
- Oh, no.
- What's going on, kitty?

213
00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:21.337
Again, again, again...

214
00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.339
Move along. Nothing to see here.

215
00:15:23.422 --> 00:15:26.926
Throw the book at them. Murder one.
Or two? Do I hear three? Sold.

216
00:15:27.009 --> 00:15:29.595
- Excuse me?
- Freeze. Now melt. Thaw.

217
00:15:29.678 --> 00:15:32.056
That's what I get
for using pharmacy batteries.

218
00:15:32.723 --> 00:15:35.309
Ai-yai-yai.

219
00:15:35.392 --> 00:15:37.019
Told you there were robots.

220
00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:38.479
What is going on?

221
00:15:38.562 --> 00:15:41.523
<i>♪ I got the NYPD blues ♪</i>

222
00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:42.733
<i>♪ Yeah, yeah ♪</i>

223
00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:46.320
Don't... Don't let them get away.

224
00:15:46.403 --> 00:15:48.280
Aye, aye, aye, captain.

225
00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:53.160
Kitty, why so mean?

226
00:15:56.872 --> 00:16:01.001
Holy smokes! Look what you just did!
Was that door even locked, AAARRRGGHH!!!?

227
00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:02.628
No.

228
00:16:04.088 --> 00:16:06.048
- Burritos, anyone?
- Ooh. Me, me, me.

229
00:16:07.841 --> 00:16:10.844
Where are they?

230
00:16:10.928 --> 00:16:13.389
Mm.

231
00:16:34.535 --> 00:16:36.829
Oh.

232
00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:45.421
You gave us quite a scare there,
Young Atlas.

233
00:16:48.465 --> 00:16:50.217
Shh. Don't move.

234
00:16:51.051 --> 00:16:51.885
Mom?

235
00:16:51.969 --> 00:16:53.470
What happened?

236
00:16:53.554 --> 00:16:56.557
Careful, honey.
You have three bruised ribs.

237
00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.017
It must hurt like mad.

238
00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.145
Oh. Not as much as a bruised ego does.

239
00:17:03.647 --> 00:17:04.690
I'm not...

240
00:17:05.607 --> 00:17:07.985
I'm not the Trollhunter anymore.

241
00:17:08.068 --> 00:17:11.321
I'm just some kid

242
00:17:11.405 --> 00:17:15.117
who convinced himself he was a hero,
when all he was...

243
00:17:15.826 --> 00:17:19.246
was just lucky enough
to find a magic amulet.

244
00:17:21.623 --> 00:17:28.005
Every hero in the annals of history
has faced dark hours, Young Atlas.

245
00:17:28.088 --> 00:17:33.969
In such moments, it's important
to recognize one's limitations.

246
00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.263
What are you saying?

247
00:17:36.346 --> 00:17:41.685
Perhaps you should consider
staying behind the lines.

248
00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:48.192
So you don't risk yourself,
or your compatriots.

249
00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:55.324
Looks like you could use something
to lift your spirits.

250
00:17:55.407 --> 00:17:58.285
I don't know. They're pretty heavy.

251
00:17:59.119 --> 00:18:00.204
Huh?

252
00:18:08.087 --> 00:18:10.547
I would be honored, Jim,

253
00:18:10.631 --> 00:18:15.552
if you stood by my side as my best man.

254
00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:20.766
I was your student,
your enemy, your friend,

255
00:18:20.849 --> 00:18:23.477
and now best man.

256
00:18:24.686 --> 00:18:26.730
The honor would be all mine.

257
00:18:30.818 --> 00:18:35.739
Well, your friends are all waiting
to see you, but, mwah, take it easy.

258
00:18:35.823 --> 00:18:37.741
Doctor's orders.

259
00:18:37.825 --> 00:18:40.410
So we live to fight another day.

260
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:43.872
Yeah, with three bruised ribs.

261
00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:45.374
You're only human.

262
00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:47.083
Now.

263
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.003
And that's enough for me.

264
00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:53.340
Oh, how's Nari?

265
00:18:53.423 --> 00:18:54.716
Uh...

266
00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:01.807
How long will this spell hold?

267
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:05.686
Douxie's transmogrification spell
won't last forever.

268
00:19:05.769 --> 00:19:10.440
Go. Which is why
my fervent studies cannot be interrupted!

269
00:19:18.448 --> 00:19:21.285
Can you stop
with the infernal noise?

270
00:19:21.368 --> 00:19:23.954
I don't know. Kind of like it.

271
00:19:24.037 --> 00:19:26.832
It helps me concentrate.
You try doing this.

272
00:19:28.458 --> 00:19:29.458
Now what?

273
00:19:30.377 --> 00:19:32.963
My sister's returned from Akiridion-5!

274
00:19:33.046 --> 00:19:35.674
Aja? My ninja-angel love muffin? Whoo!

275
00:19:44.725 --> 00:19:46.852
Sister, it's been far too long.

276
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.857
Let's try to keep to the same side
of the universe from now on, hmm?

277
00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:53.525
Hey, Your Majesty!

278
00:19:53.609 --> 00:19:54.484
Your Majesty.

279
00:19:54.568 --> 00:19:56.653
- Your Majest...
- My Majesty!

280
00:19:56.737 --> 00:19:58.197
No, Steve, don't...

281
00:19:59.323 --> 00:20:03.160
Oh, my blond oaf,
you shouldn't have done that.

282
00:20:03.744 --> 00:20:04.995
Why not? I...

283
00:20:12.628 --> 00:20:14.630
Oh, you, uh... huh?

284
00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:16.965
Uh-huh!

285
00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:21.887
You got a new boyfriend?!
I knew I wasn't good enough for you.

286
00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:25.599
Eli is not my boyfriend.

287
00:20:27.643 --> 00:20:28.852
Pepperjack?! What?

288
00:20:28.936 --> 00:20:32.272
What?

289
00:20:32.356 --> 00:20:34.900
- What? Pepperjack? Pepperjack?
- Sister!

290
00:20:34.983 --> 00:20:37.194
I hit my growth spurt.
Who would've thought?

291
00:20:37.277 --> 00:20:40.322
Puberty's a lot more pleasant
on an alien planet.

292
00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:42.658
Creepslayerz?

293
00:20:42.741 --> 00:20:43.742
Aja...

294
00:20:43.825 --> 00:20:46.954
Why didn't you wanna kiss the Palchuk?
Makes no sense.

295
00:20:47.037 --> 00:20:48.705
Are you breaking up with me?

296
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:49.831
No, no.

297
00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:54.920
If my math is right,
that was our seventh kiss.

298
00:20:55.003 --> 00:20:56.171
Oh, no.

299
00:20:56.255 --> 00:20:57.756
Why's that a big deal?

300
00:20:57.839 --> 00:21:00.259
On Akiridion-5,

301
00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:04.888
the seventh kiss makes baby.

302
00:21:07.641 --> 00:21:10.560
You mean you're pregnant? Like, right now?

303
00:21:10.644 --> 00:21:12.562
No, of course not.

304
00:21:12.646 --> 00:21:14.648
Oh, good. Phew.

305
00:21:15.232 --> 00:21:16.900
You are.

306
00:21:16.984 --> 00:21:19.152
Wha...?

307
00:21:19.236 --> 00:21:20.320
Mazel tov.

308
00:21:20.404 --> 00:21:21.905
I'm gonna be a father?

309
00:21:21.989 --> 00:21:24.241
Oh, wait. I'm gonna be a mother?

310
00:21:24.324 --> 00:21:28.203
Oh, man, I'm so glad I'm here for this.

311
00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:30.539
Now that we are all here,

312
00:21:30.622 --> 00:21:32.791
Merlin's grimoire has enlightened me

313
00:21:32.874 --> 00:21:35.711
to the destructive forces
of the Arcane Order.

314
00:21:35.794 --> 00:21:38.964
Oh, boy.
Whenever he opens a book, it's pretty bad.

315
00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:44.553
Room for one more at that big table?

316
00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:46.013
- Jimbo!
- Jim!

317
00:21:47.472 --> 00:21:49.433
Ah! Master Jim!

318
00:21:49.516 --> 00:21:52.519
By Gorgus, it is good
to see you on your feet.

319
00:21:52.602 --> 00:21:56.690
Barely, but I am happy
to stand by your side, Blinky.

320
00:21:58.692 --> 00:22:01.611
So, what are we dealing with?

321
00:22:01.695 --> 00:22:03.447
The Arcane Order.

322
00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:07.576
They seek to reawaken the Titans.

323
00:22:07.659 --> 00:22:10.162
Imbued by
the Arcane's primordial energies,

324
00:22:10.245 --> 00:22:14.499
three Titans were their handmaidens
to the birth of the universe.

325
00:22:14.583 --> 00:22:19.379
They have been in stasis for a millennia,
awaiting a reckoning of epic proportions.

326
00:22:19.463 --> 00:22:23.175
A reckoning this world,
or any other, has never seen.

327
00:22:23.258 --> 00:22:26.428
When they combine
in the center of the universe,

328
00:22:26.511 --> 00:22:30.432
Earth will be reborn,
back to the age of first creation.

329
00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:33.894
"Reborn"?

330
00:22:33.977 --> 00:22:36.480
Don't tell me
they're going to destroy the Earth.

331
00:22:36.563 --> 00:22:41.443
The opposite. They will erase all life,
burn the oceans, flood the cities.

332
00:22:43.111 --> 00:22:44.696
That's destroying it.

333
00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.657
No, it's a new start.
Life will begin again.

334
00:22:47.741 --> 00:22:50.285
Life will start anew.

335
00:22:50.368 --> 00:22:51.453
That's a joyous spin.

336
00:22:51.536 --> 00:22:53.580
Where is the center of the universe?

337
00:22:53.663 --> 00:22:55.874
You are very familiar with it.

338
00:22:56.708 --> 00:23:01.797
We don't technically have a school.
That doesn't mean we can't learn.

339
00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.341
We're going on a field trip, zoomers.

340
00:23:05.675 --> 00:23:09.679
Wait, Arcadia, our hometown,
is the center of the world?

341
00:23:09.763 --> 00:23:13.600
- Of the universe.
- Explains a lot, when you think about it.

342
00:23:13.683 --> 00:23:16.603
Nothing is getting reborn
as long as we have Nari.

343
00:23:16.686 --> 00:23:19.147
They need her
to complete the ritual, correct?

344
00:23:19.231 --> 00:23:22.025
All three primordial wizards
must be present, correct.

345
00:23:22.776 --> 00:23:25.195
Tell me you know
where the Arcane Order is.

346
00:23:47.551 --> 00:23:50.053
Ah-ah-ah.

347
00:23:50.137 --> 00:23:53.890
Struggle all you want.

348
00:23:53.974 --> 00:23:57.727
The breaking of seals
requires only your presence,

349
00:23:57.811 --> 00:23:59.938
not your commitment.

350
00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:09.781
<i>Three will rise</i>

351
00:24:09.865 --> 00:24:11.867
<i>Three will form</i>

352
00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:14.119
<i>Unite and be one</i>

353
00:24:14.202 --> 00:24:17.247
<i>The worlds are reborn</i>

354
00:24:22.294 --> 00:24:24.629
Huh? Why isn't it working?

355
00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:29.926
She is not Nari.

356
00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:31.428
Who is it?

357
00:24:31.511 --> 00:24:34.306
Abracadabra, butt-snacks.

358
00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:36.266
Prattle on.

359
00:24:36.349 --> 00:24:39.477
This world was created
to become a paradise

360
00:24:39.561 --> 00:24:43.148
in which every creature
would live in harmony.

361
00:24:43.231 --> 00:24:46.651
Humans disrespected that balance.

362
00:24:46.735 --> 00:24:47.736
Abused it.

363
00:24:47.819 --> 00:24:51.489
We will reset the world
to its original plan,

364
00:24:51.573 --> 00:24:54.492
and delete humanity from it.

365
00:24:54.576 --> 00:25:00.040
I'll warn you,
breaking your spell will be quite painful.

366
00:25:00.123 --> 00:25:01.541
Do your worst.

367
00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:03.168
As you wish.

368
00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.221
- What's wrong?
- They're breaking the spell.

369
00:25:15.555 --> 00:25:18.225
Douxie.

370
00:25:21.436 --> 00:25:23.188
Fight it, Nari. Fight it.

371
00:25:29.152 --> 00:25:31.279
It's working.

372
00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:40.455
Trollhunter make Ninth Configuration.

373
00:25:40.538 --> 00:25:44.209
Krohnisfere will make right.

374
00:25:44.292 --> 00:25:45.877
Get it.

375
00:25:45.961 --> 00:25:48.463
Get it!

376
00:26:02.852 --> 00:26:04.020
What did you say?

377
00:26:04.813 --> 00:26:07.065
I didn't say anything.

378
00:26:13.446 --> 00:26:14.446
And he's back.

379
00:26:14.489 --> 00:26:16.157
I think you said,

380
00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:19.452
"Trollhunter make Ninth Configuration.

381
00:26:19.536 --> 00:26:22.163
- Krohnisfere will make right."
- Huh?

382
00:26:22.247 --> 00:26:26.543
- What's the Ninth Configuration?
- What you said. Or she said.

383
00:26:26.626 --> 00:26:28.003
Uh, whoever said it.

384
00:26:28.086 --> 00:26:31.423
Ninth Configuration?
Sounds like an '80s boy band.

385
00:26:31.506 --> 00:26:34.384
But she said "Trollhunter."
Jim, you must know.

386
00:26:34.467 --> 00:26:37.762
I don't.
I'm not the Trollhunter anymore, remember?

387
00:26:39.597 --> 00:26:41.391
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

388
00:26:47.689 --> 00:26:49.190
Whoa.

389
00:26:49.858 --> 00:26:53.236
You guys fixed my amulet.

390
00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.447
Actually, it's new and improved.

391
00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:57.866
Built from Merlin's own blueprints.

392
00:26:57.949 --> 00:27:00.910
And a piece of Heartstone
from our homeworld.

393
00:27:01.703 --> 00:27:02.703
Have you tested it?

394
00:27:02.746 --> 00:27:05.457
How could we? You're the Trollhunter.

395
00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:08.209
"For the good of all..."

396
00:27:08.793 --> 00:27:09.793
Huh.

397
00:27:11.046 --> 00:27:12.922
Thank you for this.

398
00:27:13.006 --> 00:27:16.217
I'll need it.
Douxie, where is the Arcane Order?

399
00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:19.346
- Jim, you're hurt.
- They're about to summon the Titans.

400
00:27:19.429 --> 00:27:20.889
Did you see where they are?

401
00:27:20.972 --> 00:27:22.599
It was dark.

402
00:27:22.682 --> 00:27:24.267
Someplace circular.

403
00:27:24.351 --> 00:27:25.643
That narrows it down.

404
00:27:25.727 --> 00:27:29.939
There were seven large doors,
and rails on the ground.

405
00:27:30.023 --> 00:27:31.983
Rails, rails.

406
00:27:32.067 --> 00:27:36.112
Circular. It's a roundhouse.
A switching station for locomotives.

407
00:27:36.196 --> 00:27:38.531
- That gives us something to go on.
- Yes.

408
00:27:39.032 --> 00:27:41.826
Over 3000 somethings
in North America alone.

409
00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:44.704
Or I can lock on to Nari
and portal us there.

410
00:27:46.915 --> 00:27:47.957
Um, uh...

411
00:27:48.041 --> 00:27:49.334
I can do that.

412
00:27:50.085 --> 00:27:52.670
Yeah!

413
00:27:56.174 --> 00:27:57.092
Where are they?

414
00:27:57.175 --> 00:28:00.303
I connected to her.
She should be right here.

415
00:28:00.387 --> 00:28:01.888
She's right.

416
00:28:01.971 --> 00:28:05.683
The bricks, the masonry.
It's the right place, just...

417
00:28:05.767 --> 00:28:07.227
We don't have time to guess.

418
00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:10.271
Everyone, start searching.
We have to find them.

419
00:28:15.819 --> 00:28:18.029
Guys, guys!

420
00:28:18.113 --> 00:28:19.280
What? What is it?

421
00:28:19.364 --> 00:28:20.573
I found a penny!

422
00:28:20.657 --> 00:28:21.825
Ai-yai-yai.

423
00:28:22.409 --> 00:28:23.952
I'm afraid they're not here.

424
00:28:24.035 --> 00:28:25.495
But they were here.

425
00:28:27.622 --> 00:28:31.584
Bloody balroths, the train tracks.
Maybe they still are.

426
00:28:33.128 --> 00:28:36.631
They didn't leave this place.
It's an illusion.

427
00:28:36.714 --> 00:28:39.759
Just as the amulet
mechanizes an incantation,

428
00:28:39.843 --> 00:28:41.136
the train tracks...

429
00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:46.516
The train tracks. Look, they're a sigil.
A giant mechanical invocation.

430
00:28:54.733 --> 00:28:56.568
Oh, no, no! My penny!

431
00:29:14.627 --> 00:29:16.421
See? It is a sigil.

432
00:29:16.504 --> 00:29:17.714
Get ready.

433
00:29:21.384 --> 00:29:23.720
<i>Three will rise</i>

434
00:29:23.803 --> 00:29:26.014
<i>Three will form</i>

435
00:29:26.097 --> 00:29:28.850
<i>Unite and be one</i>

436
00:29:28.933 --> 00:29:30.852
<i>The worlds are reborn</i>

437
00:29:30.935 --> 00:29:31.853
Nari!

438
00:29:31.936 --> 00:29:34.397
Too late. She's under Bellroc's control.

439
00:29:34.481 --> 00:29:36.608
- They haven't united.
- There's still time.

440
00:29:36.691 --> 00:29:40.195
For the good of all,
Daylight is mine to command.

441
00:29:42.989 --> 00:29:45.116
Oh, no. Not now.

442
00:29:45.784 --> 00:29:49.412
For the good of all,
Daylight is mine to command.

443
00:29:49.496 --> 00:29:51.289
<i>...are reborn</i>

444
00:29:51.372 --> 00:29:54.042
Daylight is mine to command!

445
00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:56.377
<i>Three will form</i>

446
00:29:56.461 --> 00:29:58.505
<i>Unite and be one</i>

447
00:29:58.588 --> 00:30:01.299
<i>The worlds are reborn</i>

448
00:30:01.382 --> 00:30:03.468
We have to destroy the Genesis Seals.

449
00:30:13.353 --> 00:30:14.604
- Oh, no.
- Kleb.

450
00:30:14.687 --> 00:30:15.939
Oh, please. Come on.

451
00:30:21.528 --> 00:30:23.404
Jimbo, what do we do?

452
00:30:26.199 --> 00:30:29.619
It is time.

453
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:46.511
What just happened?

454
00:30:46.594 --> 00:30:49.556
The amulet failed.

455
00:30:49.639 --> 00:30:51.140
I failed.

456
00:30:52.141 --> 00:30:53.768
So now what?

457
00:30:58.106 --> 00:30:59.899
The Titans will rise.

458
00:31:04.195 --> 00:31:06.030
<i>Make it a good one, Jason.</i>

459
00:31:10.493 --> 00:31:12.287
<i>Really bad spin.</i>

460
00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:13.913
Yeah, nice spin.

461
00:31:14.664 --> 00:31:16.875
Hmm?

462
00:31:25.633 --> 00:31:27.010
What in the...?

463
00:31:35.894 --> 00:31:37.312
Shh!

464
00:33:05.566 --> 00:33:06.901
<i>Gol!</i>

465
00:33:45.106 --> 00:33:49.235
Let the Earth begin anew.

466
00:33:49.318 --> 00:33:52.363
<i>Incredible, folks.
What you see is from our affiliate.</i>

467
00:33:52.447 --> 00:33:55.783
<i>After multiple attempts to communicate,
Chinese forces have been ordered</i>

468
00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:57.702
<i>to forgo peacekeeping measures.</i>

469
00:33:57.785 --> 00:34:00.872
<i>Sylvia, is someone riding atop that thing?</i>

470
00:34:00.955 --> 00:34:02.540
Oh! Don't look, my little one.

471
00:34:02.623 --> 00:34:03.624
<i>I can't tell.</i>

472
00:34:03.708 --> 00:34:04.834
<i>The question at hand is,</i>

473
00:34:04.917 --> 00:34:07.253
<i>why have they surfaced,
and what do they want?</i>

474
00:34:07.336 --> 00:34:09.172
No, the question is,

475
00:34:09.255 --> 00:34:13.551
why do the pickles
taste so good with ice cream?!

476
00:34:13.634 --> 00:34:17.305
They're not supposed
to be coming together as one thing,

477
00:34:17.388 --> 00:34:20.683
but taste incredibly delicious.

478
00:34:20.767 --> 00:34:22.268
It tastes so good.

479
00:34:22.351 --> 00:34:23.352
It tastes so...

480
00:34:26.439 --> 00:34:29.984
- How long until they converge?
- Eighteen hours, six minutes.

481
00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:32.862
I've crammed for final exams in less time.
We got this.

482
00:34:32.945 --> 00:34:35.364
- What do we do?
- We take Nari at her word.

483
00:34:35.448 --> 00:34:39.535
"Trollhunter make Ninth Configuration.
Krohnisfere will make right."

484
00:34:39.619 --> 00:34:43.081
Perhaps this Krohnisfere
holds the answer to combat the Titans.

485
00:34:43.164 --> 00:34:44.457
We need to find it.

486
00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:49.045
Its last known whereabouts
had it in the possession of TrollDragons,

487
00:34:49.128 --> 00:34:52.006
a race so secret, so ruthless,

488
00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:54.967
even I have not seen them
with all my eyes.

489
00:34:56.177 --> 00:34:58.638
What? TrollDragons? Sounds made-up.

490
00:34:58.721 --> 00:35:01.307
My dad might know.
He used to keep rough company.

491
00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:06.395
Even with the Krohnisfere,
we still don't have a Trollhunter.

492
00:35:11.567 --> 00:35:15.238
We must summon the largest Akiridion ships

493
00:35:15.321 --> 00:35:16.697
and evacuate Earth.

494
00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:18.991
Evacuate Earth?

495
00:35:19.075 --> 00:35:20.451
Run? Not an option.

496
00:35:20.535 --> 00:35:23.704
You know as well as I,
there are other planets.

497
00:35:23.788 --> 00:35:24.831
Not like this.

498
00:35:24.914 --> 00:35:27.416
- Running away is not the answer.
- Shh. It's okay.

499
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:28.876
Mommy's just a little upset.

500
00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.878
Where is your trust in our Trollhunter?

501
00:35:30.962 --> 00:35:32.922
Does he even trust himself?

502
00:35:33.965 --> 00:35:35.466
It's suicide. We need others.

503
00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:37.677
The Trollhunter is still the Trollhunter.

504
00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.555
You're not safe here.
There are many other places to go.

505
00:35:40.638 --> 00:35:43.266
- Are you insane?
- Running isn't the answer.

506
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:45.685
- This is the only way.
- Listen to me.

507
00:35:45.768 --> 00:35:47.728
- We need to leave.
- This is banality.

508
00:35:50.606 --> 00:35:51.607
Stop!

509
00:35:51.691 --> 00:35:52.984
Hush.

510
00:35:55.194 --> 00:35:58.739
We're facing the end of the world.
We can't argue with each other.

511
00:35:58.823 --> 00:36:00.741
And we can't play it safe.

512
00:36:02.243 --> 00:36:04.745
I've made mistakes,
but the amulet doesn't.

513
00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:06.956
It brought us all together for a reason.

514
00:36:07.039 --> 00:36:09.167
It chose me for a reason.

515
00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:10.835
I have to trust it.

516
00:36:10.918 --> 00:36:14.255
And I'm asking all of you to trust me.

517
00:36:14.338 --> 00:36:16.257
Anytime, anywhere, Jimbo.

518
00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:20.011
It was the two of us at the start.
It'll be the two of us until the end.

519
00:36:20.094 --> 00:36:21.512
What about the rest of you?

520
00:36:22.096 --> 00:36:22.930
Sister?

521
00:36:23.014 --> 00:36:24.473
Ships are coming.

522
00:36:24.557 --> 00:36:28.519
But until they arrive,
we'll do things your way.

523
00:36:28.603 --> 00:36:32.148
You said the stone
in the new amulet was from Akiridion-5.

524
00:36:32.231 --> 00:36:33.816
Yes, I took it myself.

525
00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:38.070
The amulet came from Merlin.
The stone needs to carry the same magic.

526
00:36:38.154 --> 00:36:40.364
But Merlin's staff was destroyed.

527
00:36:41.407 --> 00:36:42.992
But not Excalibur.

528
00:36:43.075 --> 00:36:47.580
Excalibur! By Gorgus.
The stone in the hilt.

529
00:36:47.663 --> 00:36:49.790
Three Titans, three courses of action.

530
00:36:49.874 --> 00:36:52.084
Stuart and Krel, get me Excalibur.

531
00:36:52.168 --> 00:36:53.461
We shall get right on it.

532
00:36:53.544 --> 00:36:55.755
Claire, lead a team
to find the Krohnisfere.

533
00:36:57.215 --> 00:36:58.216
And the rest of us?

534
00:36:58.299 --> 00:37:00.092
Amulet or no amulet,

535
00:37:00.176 --> 00:37:02.553
we do everything we can
to take these Titans down.

536
00:37:02.637 --> 00:37:04.263
- We got this.
- Ah, indeed.

537
00:37:05.014 --> 00:37:08.351
We all know only one
can pull Excalibur from the stone.

538
00:37:08.434 --> 00:37:10.311
Jim tried before. He failed.

539
00:37:10.394 --> 00:37:13.272
- But he is the Trollhunter.
- Is he anymore?

540
00:37:13.356 --> 00:37:14.732
We need a plan B.

541
00:37:14.815 --> 00:37:17.818
If he fails, I will not.

542
00:37:17.902 --> 00:37:20.988
Contact Varvatos Vex.
Deploy the secret weapon.

543
00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:24.575
Did someone say "secret weapon"?
I wanna know.

544
00:37:24.659 --> 00:37:25.868
- It's a secret.
- Ooh.

545
00:37:25.952 --> 00:37:28.246
- Trust me, you'll like it.
- Ah!

546
00:37:38.381 --> 00:37:41.300
Go save the world,
my ninja butt-kicking angel.

547
00:37:41.384 --> 00:37:43.844
Keep our little ones safe.

548
00:37:43.928 --> 00:37:45.638
I will... "Little ones"?

549
00:37:45.721 --> 00:37:48.099
"Ones"? There's more than one?

550
00:37:48.182 --> 00:37:50.351
Three to five.

551
00:37:58.317 --> 00:37:59.986
- Aarghaumont.
- Hmm?

552
00:38:01.153 --> 00:38:03.864
Should one of us fall, well, know this.

553
00:38:03.948 --> 00:38:06.158
It has been an honor to know you.

554
00:38:08.452 --> 00:38:11.872
There was never
one as brave and as loyal as you.

555
00:38:11.956 --> 00:38:16.627
I pity anyone
on the receiving end of your fury.

556
00:38:16.711 --> 00:38:20.006
I pity anyone on either end of your wit.

557
00:38:20.089 --> 00:38:21.340
Whoa.

558
00:38:21.424 --> 00:38:25.052
Ah, yes, my wit has been known
to reduce the bravest to tears.

559
00:38:25.136 --> 00:38:26.595
Of boredom.

560
00:38:26.679 --> 00:38:27.805
Let's go.

561
00:38:39.525 --> 00:38:40.525
Claire?

562
00:38:54.665 --> 00:38:56.542
Nice Round Table speech back there.

563
00:38:56.625 --> 00:38:58.544
Yeah, thanks.

564
00:38:59.295 --> 00:39:00.546
What's wrong?

565
00:39:00.629 --> 00:39:04.550
My mother is finally happy,
but the world's about to end.

566
00:39:04.633 --> 00:39:07.386
And I can't do anything to stop it.

567
00:39:09.388 --> 00:39:10.639
But we can.

568
00:39:10.723 --> 00:39:12.141
What if I...?

569
00:39:13.142 --> 00:39:15.686
What if I never see you again?

570
00:39:17.355 --> 00:39:20.816
I will always be here... and here.

571
00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:31.202
Oh! Hey, guys.
Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.

572
00:39:31.285 --> 00:39:35.456
But...

573
00:39:35.539 --> 00:39:37.166
- What?
- Thought you'd never ask.

574
00:39:37.249 --> 00:39:40.127
Everyone was picked for a team
specialized for the task.

575
00:39:40.211 --> 00:39:42.129
Blinky didn't know where to place me.

576
00:39:42.213 --> 00:39:45.049
That got us taking stock
of my strengths and weaknesses,

577
00:39:45.132 --> 00:39:48.135
which isn't so great
for the old self-esteem.

578
00:39:48.219 --> 00:39:50.054
- Wanna fight Titans?
- Does it show?

579
00:39:50.137 --> 00:39:53.724
You're with me.
Always have been, always will be.

580
00:39:53.808 --> 00:39:56.018
And I could use some moral support.

581
00:39:56.102 --> 00:39:58.437
Ah. The lamest of the superpowers.

582
00:40:07.613 --> 00:40:10.991
Well, look who's returned.

583
00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:14.703
Not busy saving the world today, son?

584
00:40:14.787 --> 00:40:18.332
If only you knew. We're looking
for something called the Krohnisfere.

585
00:40:18.416 --> 00:40:22.294
- Turn around, Archibald.
- You've heard of it?

586
00:40:22.378 --> 00:40:26.715
The Krohnisfere
holds the power of time infinite

587
00:40:26.799 --> 00:40:30.845
and tells of the past and future.

588
00:40:30.928 --> 00:40:34.557
Zong-Shi never averts his gaze from it.

589
00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:39.311
He's convinced it'll show him
the moment of his demise.

590
00:40:39.395 --> 00:40:42.314
I don't need to find that ill-fated relic

591
00:40:42.398 --> 00:40:46.986
to know only death will come
to those who go looking for it.

592
00:40:47.069 --> 00:40:50.698
Well, if you don't want
to spend time with your son, then don't.

593
00:40:50.781 --> 00:40:54.201
Hmm. Will your cowardly friends
be with you?

594
00:40:54.285 --> 00:40:57.496
Including the troll with many eyes?

595
00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.457
The one that screams a lot?

596
00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:00.583
Yes.

597
00:41:00.666 --> 00:41:02.126
In that case...

598
00:41:10.968 --> 00:41:13.387
Oh, relax, Blinky.

599
00:41:13.471 --> 00:41:16.348
Don't you know,
flying's the safest form of travel?

600
00:41:16.432 --> 00:41:19.685
I don't think aging dragons
are included in those statistics.

601
00:41:19.768 --> 00:41:22.730
"Aging"? I'm experienced.

602
00:41:22.813 --> 00:41:26.525
Trust me.

603
00:41:27.401 --> 00:41:30.946
All right, all right. I trust you.

604
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:33.866
I simply love it when he screams.

605
00:41:33.949 --> 00:41:36.118
Thanks for the assist,
Mr. Charlemagne,

606
00:41:36.202 --> 00:41:40.372
but didn't your son tell you I could've
used my magic to shorten the trip?

607
00:41:40.456 --> 00:41:46.337
Where would be the fun in that?
Plus, TrollDragons are wary of sorcery.

608
00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:49.882
Their lair is resistant to shadow magic.

609
00:41:49.965 --> 00:41:53.844
So we'll have to do this
the old-fashioned way.

610
00:41:55.596 --> 00:41:58.682
Welcome to Stonecarver Bridge.

611
00:42:00.059 --> 00:42:05.397
Our way into the TrollMarket
is through there!

612
00:42:08.776 --> 00:42:10.069
Kitty!

613
00:42:23.332 --> 00:42:25.918
- Oh?
- Oh, sweet terra firma.

614
00:42:26.001 --> 00:42:28.379
Mwah. Oh, I missed you.

615
00:42:28.462 --> 00:42:29.463
<i>Avant!</i>

616
00:42:30.548 --> 00:42:31.840
No shadow magic,

617
00:42:31.924 --> 00:42:35.511
but we are in possession of a horngazel.

618
00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:46.814
No, don't. They think you're bad guys.

619
00:42:46.897 --> 00:42:48.816
They're the ones pointing weapons.

620
00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:50.192
Brave aviators.

621
00:42:50.276 --> 00:42:52.611
Curious eyes, merciful ears.

622
00:42:52.695 --> 00:42:54.071
Though what appears before you

623
00:42:54.154 --> 00:42:57.408
is undoubtedly monstrous,
it pales in comparison for what is next.

624
00:43:03.914 --> 00:43:06.750
But our fate is entwined
and predicated on peace.

625
00:43:12.214 --> 00:43:13.507
Love is the one...

626
00:43:16.969 --> 00:43:18.053
Blinky!

627
00:43:25.894 --> 00:43:27.062
Charlemagne!

628
00:43:27.771 --> 00:43:28.771
Let's go.

629
00:43:39.783 --> 00:43:43.495
Descriptions of this place
hardly do it justice.

630
00:43:43.579 --> 00:43:45.831
Holy frijole.

631
00:43:45.914 --> 00:43:47.124
Indeed.

632
00:43:47.207 --> 00:43:50.002
"Holy frijole" will have to suffice.

633
00:44:00.638 --> 00:44:04.516
What is beauty,
if at the cost of others?

634
00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:07.728
Zong-Shi wants everything,

635
00:44:07.811 --> 00:44:10.064
even time itself.

636
00:44:10.147 --> 00:44:13.359
All these trolls held against their will.

637
00:44:13.442 --> 00:44:14.985
And for what?

638
00:44:15.069 --> 00:44:17.279
He tries to avoid death,

639
00:44:17.363 --> 00:44:20.908
<i>while everyone around him dies.</i>

640
00:44:20.991 --> 00:44:24.411
Ah, Charlemagne.

641
00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:27.373
You finally paid me a visit.

642
00:44:28.999 --> 00:44:30.709
I just have one question.

643
00:44:30.793 --> 00:44:34.588
If this TrollDragon you know
never takes his eyes off the Krohnisfere,

644
00:44:34.672 --> 00:44:36.382
how are we supposed to steal it?

645
00:44:36.465 --> 00:44:39.343
I figured you'd tell me.

646
00:44:41.679 --> 00:44:44.014
Halt, outsiders.

647
00:44:45.265 --> 00:44:46.265
Oh, dear.

648
00:44:46.308 --> 00:44:47.935
Cut the pleasantries.

649
00:44:48.018 --> 00:44:50.312
Just take us to your leader.

650
00:44:52.981 --> 00:44:55.359
Krel's coordinates show
we should be on top of it.

651
00:44:55.442 --> 00:44:58.237
- Maybe his numbers are off.
- What would they be on?

652
00:44:59.446 --> 00:45:01.407
Iceberg!

653
00:45:02.699 --> 00:45:04.076
That's no iceberg.

654
00:45:05.661 --> 00:45:07.037
I've got this.

655
00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.257
I hope the others are doing better.

656
00:45:23.429 --> 00:45:26.765
AAARRRGGHH!!!, we're catching up.

657
00:45:26.849 --> 00:45:28.976
Keep on with its shadow.

658
00:45:33.188 --> 00:45:35.107
There, there. Take me there.

659
00:45:36.775 --> 00:45:38.819
Oh, fuzzbuckets!

660
00:45:46.368 --> 00:45:47.744
Oh, made it.

661
00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:49.872
Oh, no, no, no...

662
00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:58.172
Sloppy.

663
00:46:04.011 --> 00:46:05.220
Man the cannons.

664
00:46:09.057 --> 00:46:10.184
Come on.

665
00:46:14.313 --> 00:46:15.397
Hold.

666
00:46:16.732 --> 00:46:18.233
Hold.

667
00:46:18.859 --> 00:46:19.693
Fire!

668
00:46:33.749 --> 00:46:34.749
Fire again.

669
00:46:41.298 --> 00:46:45.093
- Where are you going?
- To heat things up.

670
00:46:54.478 --> 00:46:55.562
Nomura!

671
00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.024
<i>Tenebrius Excilium.</i>

672
00:47:37.521 --> 00:47:39.773
- Can you get me on that?
- In this weather?

673
00:47:39.856 --> 00:47:41.608
My wings would freeze.

674
00:47:41.692 --> 00:47:44.027
We'd fall like a rock.

675
00:47:44.111 --> 00:47:48.115
Then again, flying is overrated.

676
00:47:48.198 --> 00:47:49.741
- Jim.
- I know, Mom.

677
00:47:49.825 --> 00:47:51.243
I'll be careful.

678
00:47:54.329 --> 00:47:57.291
Angels and ministers of grace,

679
00:47:57.374 --> 00:47:58.667
defend us.

680
00:48:02.713 --> 00:48:06.049
Careful, Young Atlas.
That's a lot of explosives.

681
00:48:06.133 --> 00:48:08.844
That's the point, isn't it?

682
00:48:20.314 --> 00:48:21.356
No. Jim!

683
00:48:35.203 --> 00:48:36.788
We're gonna need a bigger castle.

684
00:48:38.206 --> 00:48:39.206
No, no, no.

685
00:48:41.293 --> 00:48:43.128
No, no. Jim!

686
00:48:49.551 --> 00:48:50.594
Gotcha.

687
00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:22.542
No! Nomura, no!

688
00:49:35.847 --> 00:49:37.099
You know, Jim,

689
00:49:37.182 --> 00:49:38.975
I once tried to kill you.

690
00:49:39.059 --> 00:49:40.519
I really did.

691
00:49:41.311 --> 00:49:43.355
And now, well,

692
00:49:43.438 --> 00:49:46.441
I've never felt so good about failing.

693
00:49:46.525 --> 00:49:48.902
No. No!

694
00:49:48.985 --> 00:49:51.405
I should've played it safe like you said.

695
00:49:51.488 --> 00:49:53.740
I was wrong, Young Atlas.

696
00:49:53.824 --> 00:49:59.621
To ask you not to be a hero
is like asking the sun not to rise.

697
00:50:00.414 --> 00:50:04.000
Take care of Barbara for me, Young Atlas.

698
00:50:06.044 --> 00:50:07.796
Strickler, no!

699
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:12.884
What a fleeting moment this life is.

700
00:50:25.439 --> 00:50:27.899
No!

701
00:50:31.319 --> 00:50:32.571
Walter.

702
00:50:39.619 --> 00:50:40.746
No.

703
00:50:51.006 --> 00:50:52.758
No.

704
00:51:00.515 --> 00:51:01.600
Impossible.

705
00:51:14.446 --> 00:51:15.947
I'm sorry.

706
00:51:16.031 --> 00:51:21.203
He was trying to save me,
and it didn't even stop the Titan.

707
00:51:21.828 --> 00:51:25.457
He said he couldn't fly.
This is all my fault.

708
00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:27.292
No, Jim.

709
00:51:27.375 --> 00:51:29.836
You did what you had to do.

710
00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:33.590
What you thought you should do.

711
00:51:34.758 --> 00:51:37.427
That's what Walter loved most about you.

712
00:51:37.511 --> 00:51:38.720
That you never give up.

713
00:51:38.804 --> 00:51:41.181
That you see things through.

714
00:51:41.264 --> 00:51:42.766
You always have.

715
00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.018
Not like your father.

716
00:51:46.269 --> 00:51:48.063
We never talk about him.

717
00:51:48.897 --> 00:51:50.899
I've always wondered.

718
00:51:51.858 --> 00:51:54.694
There's really nothing
I can tell you, Jim.

719
00:51:54.778 --> 00:51:57.781
No big revelation I can give you.

720
00:51:57.864 --> 00:52:00.534
No great thing I can say, except...

721
00:52:01.493 --> 00:52:03.161
you're your mother's son.

722
00:52:03.245 --> 00:52:04.996
You will always have me,

723
00:52:05.705 --> 00:52:07.707
and I will always have you.

724
00:52:08.667 --> 00:52:12.254
And neither of us ever give up.

725
00:52:17.634 --> 00:52:20.136
Come on, Jimbo, we have to go.

726
00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:22.389
Go? Where?

727
00:52:22.472 --> 00:52:24.599
Hong Kong.

728
00:52:24.683 --> 00:52:27.018
We've lost contact with Claire.

729
00:52:29.646 --> 00:52:31.648
We never give up.

730
00:52:33.441 --> 00:52:34.441
Ever.

731
00:52:54.379 --> 00:53:00.427
Charlemagne, I never expected
to see you return here.

732
00:53:01.094 --> 00:53:03.597
Old foe.

733
00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.891
Look at me, you blind fool.

734
00:53:05.974 --> 00:53:07.017
I am looking.

735
00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:09.561
I am always looking.

736
00:53:10.353 --> 00:53:14.024
You are an old fool,
seeking to take that which is mine.

737
00:53:14.107 --> 00:53:15.025
Mine, you hear?

738
00:53:15.108 --> 00:53:18.528
And your hide will hang here as my trophy.

739
00:53:18.612 --> 00:53:23.241
It's all so futile, you see?
No one can see the future coming.

740
00:53:23.325 --> 00:53:27.287
I see more than you could know.

741
00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:30.248
You demon.

742
00:53:31.499 --> 00:53:34.961
And as for your fleshy friend...

743
00:53:35.045 --> 00:53:36.045
No.

744
00:53:36.838 --> 00:53:40.842
Your armor,
I shall wear it like an amulet.

745
00:53:40.926 --> 00:53:42.177
Ew.

746
00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:43.762
Enough of this.

747
00:53:48.308 --> 00:53:49.809
What are you doing?

748
00:53:49.893 --> 00:53:51.519
What we came here to do.

749
00:53:51.603 --> 00:53:53.980
That's my boy.

750
00:53:54.064 --> 00:53:55.064
Claire!

751
00:54:01.613 --> 00:54:03.698
Mistress Claire, no, no, no!

752
00:54:03.782 --> 00:54:06.701
Yes, I'm free!

753
00:54:07.619 --> 00:54:10.205
<i>My sphere!</i>

754
00:54:10.288 --> 00:54:13.583
My sphere!

755
00:54:16.294 --> 00:54:17.128
Great gruesome.

756
00:54:17.212 --> 00:54:20.006
Unhand my son, you demon!

757
00:54:20.757 --> 00:54:22.050
Give it back to me.

758
00:54:22.133 --> 00:54:24.386
I must see what will happen.

759
00:54:28.014 --> 00:54:29.432
Bet you didn't see that coming.

760
00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:32.435
No!

761
00:54:37.941 --> 00:54:39.484
We got it. Let's go.

762
00:54:44.823 --> 00:54:46.908
After them, you fools!

763
00:55:05.343 --> 00:55:06.469
Guys?

764
00:55:38.293 --> 00:55:40.837
- It's heading for the bridge.
- What do we do?

765
00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.756
I don't know. I don't know.

766
00:55:43.590 --> 00:55:45.008
I don't know anymore.

767
00:55:45.091 --> 00:55:46.760
Hold on, I'm getting...

768
00:55:47.969 --> 00:55:51.514
Yes. You remember the secret weapon?
It's here.

769
00:55:54.726 --> 00:55:55.726
Is that...?

770
00:56:01.357 --> 00:56:03.193
<i>I am Gun Robot.</i>

771
00:56:03.276 --> 00:56:06.988
Jim, that's him! That's Gun Robot!
Oh, my gosh, it's Gun Robot! You see?

772
00:56:12.786 --> 00:56:15.914
Awesomest-sauce.

773
00:56:15.997 --> 00:56:16.831
But how?

774
00:56:16.915 --> 00:56:19.584
Varvatos apologizes for being late.

775
00:56:19.667 --> 00:56:24.339
The manufacture of Eli's design
took longer than expected.

776
00:56:24.422 --> 00:56:27.592
Eli designed a whole Gun Robot?

777
00:56:27.675 --> 00:56:29.636
Can I keep it and take it to school?

778
00:56:30.261 --> 00:56:31.638
Stand fast.

779
00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:35.683
Varvatos is about
to reduce this fiery beast...

780
00:56:37.268 --> 00:56:40.105
to a smoldering campfire.

781
00:57:00.458 --> 00:57:01.376
What's going on?

782
00:57:01.459 --> 00:57:05.880
If I were to surmise,
the bridge above appears to be collapsing!

783
00:57:05.964 --> 00:57:08.341
If the bridge falls,
there'll be no way out.

784
00:57:13.346 --> 00:57:14.931
Give me my sphere.

785
00:57:15.014 --> 00:57:16.808
I must know my fate.

786
00:57:16.891 --> 00:57:19.144
<i>Give it to him so we can get out...</i>

787
00:57:19.227 --> 00:57:21.896
Give it to him so we can get out...

788
00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:23.523
That was fortuitous.

789
00:57:25.066 --> 00:57:26.234
Mistress Claire!

790
00:57:28.486 --> 00:57:30.071
My future.

791
00:57:34.617 --> 00:57:35.994
- Uch. Ew.
- Bleh.

792
00:57:36.077 --> 00:57:37.537
By Gorgus.

793
00:57:38.955 --> 00:57:43.585
And that's why
I never read my horoscopes.

794
00:58:00.894 --> 00:58:03.146
<i>I am Gun Robot.</i>

795
00:58:03.229 --> 00:58:05.315
<i>I am Gun Robot.</i>

796
00:58:05.398 --> 00:58:07.650
<i>I am Gun Robot.</i>

797
00:58:07.734 --> 00:58:09.777
Yes!

798
00:58:09.861 --> 00:58:12.405
One, two, and three.

799
00:58:12.489 --> 00:58:14.199
He's finished.

800
00:58:16.242 --> 00:58:17.785
<i>I am Gun Robot.</i>

801
00:58:17.869 --> 00:58:20.747
Varvatos loves it when he says that.

802
00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:23.333
This is going on in front of our faces!
This is real!

803
00:58:23.416 --> 00:58:27.086
No evildoers
shall be approaching this bridge.

804
00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:29.047
Not today.

805
00:58:29.130 --> 00:58:32.467
Not if Varvatos and the Robot of Guns

806
00:58:32.550 --> 00:58:34.719
have anything to say about it.

807
00:58:35.845 --> 00:58:37.722
Varvatos, behind you.

808
00:58:39.933 --> 00:58:41.768
Systems failing.

809
00:58:41.851 --> 00:58:45.188
Varvatos calmly suggests
you all might want to...

810
00:58:45.271 --> 00:58:46.898
Run for your lives!

811
00:58:54.697 --> 00:58:56.658
We have to get away from the bridge.

812
00:59:17.136 --> 00:59:19.222
Blinky, the horngazel!

813
00:59:24.269 --> 00:59:25.979
Open the gate.

814
00:59:41.619 --> 00:59:42.745
Varvatos!

815
00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:45.790
My queen, we must retreat.
The bridge is unstable.

816
00:59:45.873 --> 00:59:47.500
Claire and Blinky are in there.

817
00:59:47.584 --> 00:59:49.252
We can't... I can't leave.

818
00:59:49.335 --> 00:59:52.255
Jim, it's too late. The bridge will fall.

819
00:59:52.338 --> 00:59:54.799
Without the bridge, there's no way out.

820
00:59:57.135 --> 00:59:58.678
You don't have to stay, Tobes.

821
00:59:58.761 --> 01:00:01.723
I'm with you, Jim.
Always have been, always will be.

822
01:00:04.642 --> 01:00:07.186
Oh, come on, Claire. Where are you?

823
01:00:13.234 --> 01:00:14.485
Jim.

824
01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:20.158
Oh, no.

825
01:00:25.079 --> 01:00:26.372
Jim, your hand!

826
01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:28.249
- Master Jim!
- Claire?

827
01:00:28.333 --> 01:00:29.500
Jim!

828
01:00:29.584 --> 01:00:31.502
I thought I was gonna lose you.

829
01:00:31.586 --> 01:00:33.796
- Archie?
- Hurry, Claire.

830
01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:38.176
Go, save yourself. I'll keep them at bay.

831
01:00:38.259 --> 01:00:39.552
Archie, we have to go.

832
01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:41.137
I have to help him.

833
01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:43.556
Tell Douxie I said goodbye.

834
01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:44.724
Archie!

835
01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:46.100
Time to go, Claire.

836
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:51.981
Oh, good heavens.
What will I do for an eternity with you?

837
01:00:52.065 --> 01:00:56.694
We can play Scrabble,
or take over the whole darn kingdom!

838
01:00:56.778 --> 01:00:58.946
I always wanted a kingdom of my own.

839
01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:00.448
Hey!

840
01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:26.099
We have the Krohnisfere.

841
01:01:33.481 --> 01:01:35.817
Where is it going?

842
01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:36.900
Arcadia.

843
01:01:50.748 --> 01:01:53.626
<i>Tell Douxie I said goodbye.</i>

844
01:01:55.002 --> 01:01:57.880
- I hope he's happy.
- I'm sure he is.

845
01:01:57.964 --> 01:01:59.382
He's with his dad.

846
01:02:01.092 --> 01:02:04.095
Arcadia is on the other side
of that ridge.

847
01:02:04.178 --> 01:02:05.930
We have to stop them here.

848
01:02:06.013 --> 01:02:08.141
At least we have the Krohnisfere.

849
01:02:08.224 --> 01:02:10.309
How does this bring us victory?

850
01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:12.353
Do you bludgeon your foe with it?

851
01:02:13.187 --> 01:02:15.648
Sort of looks
like a blinged-out Magic 8-Ball.

852
01:02:18.192 --> 01:02:20.403
How is this supposed to make things right?

853
01:02:20.486 --> 01:02:22.280
I... don't know.

854
01:02:22.363 --> 01:02:24.657
If only Nari were more specific.

855
01:02:24.741 --> 01:02:27.785
Let me talk to her. I need to try again.

856
01:02:27.869 --> 01:02:31.414
She's fused with that Titan.
You saw what happened to Nomura.

857
01:02:31.497 --> 01:02:33.416
I was inside her head once before.

858
01:02:33.499 --> 01:02:36.252
I can do it again.
But I need to be with her.

859
01:02:36.335 --> 01:02:37.253
You will.

860
01:02:37.336 --> 01:02:39.297
And you won't be alone.

861
01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:41.340
Aja, where is Nari right now?

862
01:02:46.804 --> 01:02:48.014
Ai-yai-yai.

863
01:02:48.097 --> 01:02:51.476
<i>♪ Ay, ay, ay, ay ♪</i>

864
01:03:14.081 --> 01:03:15.081
Nari!

865
01:03:16.125 --> 01:03:17.125
Nari?

866
01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:19.170
She can't hear you.

867
01:03:20.379 --> 01:03:23.382
I have to believe
you're still in there, Nari.

868
01:03:24.258 --> 01:03:25.635
If you can hear me,

869
01:03:25.718 --> 01:03:28.179
please, give me a sign.

870
01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:33.226
Jim!

871
01:03:34.101 --> 01:03:35.978
Hurry, Douxie!

872
01:03:36.062 --> 01:03:38.648
Oh, no, no. That's not a good sign.

873
01:03:39.899 --> 01:03:41.317
Blast it, Nari.

874
01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:42.485
Fight it.

875
01:03:43.277 --> 01:03:44.695
Douxie!

876
01:03:46.697 --> 01:03:49.742
I'm staying with you,
no matter what.

877
01:03:51.452 --> 01:03:54.413
No more running, remember?

878
01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:57.375
No more running.

879
01:03:58.751 --> 01:04:01.921
No more running.

880
01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:22.440
Douxie?

881
01:04:22.483 --> 01:04:23.609
Nari.

882
01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:26.070
Where am I?

883
01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:28.364
You're with us.

884
01:04:28.447 --> 01:04:29.532
You're with us.

885
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:32.994
Nari, we have the Krohnisfere,

886
01:04:33.077 --> 01:04:35.830
but we don't know how
to make the Ninth Configuration.

887
01:04:35.913 --> 01:04:37.832
How does it make it right?

888
01:04:37.915 --> 01:04:40.751
Trollhunter make Ninth Configuration.

889
01:04:40.835 --> 01:04:43.504
Krohnisfere will make right.

890
01:04:43.588 --> 01:04:44.672
Please, Nari.

891
01:04:44.755 --> 01:04:48.384
Time unfolds differently, like a flower.

892
01:04:48.467 --> 01:04:51.596
Only Trollhunter will know.

893
01:04:52.597 --> 01:04:54.849
That doesn't make any sense.

894
01:04:54.932 --> 01:04:57.184
Well, at least we have Nari now.

895
01:04:57.268 --> 01:05:01.022
No, you have a Titan.

896
01:05:01.105 --> 01:05:04.191
Yeah, a Titan miles away
from the other Titans.

897
01:05:04.275 --> 01:05:07.111
Not for long. I know how to get you there.

898
01:05:07.194 --> 01:05:09.196
No, the Titan is too big.

899
01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.156
Jim's right.

900
01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:11.532
I can do this.

901
01:05:11.616 --> 01:05:15.119
One more time!

902
01:05:15.202 --> 01:05:17.288
<i>♪ Fifteen bottles of beer on the wall ♪</i>

903
01:05:17.371 --> 01:05:18.623
<i>♪ Fifteen bottles of beer ♪</i>

904
01:05:18.706 --> 01:05:20.333
Root beer. Root beer, people.

905
01:05:20.958 --> 01:05:22.418
No. No beer.

906
01:05:23.794 --> 01:05:26.255
- Here we are.
- Hey, coach.

907
01:05:26.339 --> 01:05:27.506
Is this place safe?

908
01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:30.217
Of course. You'll all be thanking me.

909
01:05:30.301 --> 01:05:33.429
There's absolutely nothing
all the way out here.

910
01:05:33.512 --> 01:05:35.222
Yeah, not even reception.

911
01:05:37.266 --> 01:05:39.685
Uh... what was that?

912
01:05:41.437 --> 01:05:43.564
Hey, my glasses.

913
01:05:43.648 --> 01:05:45.024
Coach?

914
01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:48.319
Oh, it's getting kind of cold here.

915
01:05:49.862 --> 01:05:52.490
Ooh, ooh, I got a bar. Ooh, two bars. Two!

916
01:06:17.348 --> 01:06:21.978
We're going back to the city,
where it's safe!

917
01:06:24.355 --> 01:06:25.481
Guys?

918
01:06:25.564 --> 01:06:27.108
It's coming.

919
01:06:27.191 --> 01:06:29.068
Great Gronka Morka.

920
01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:49.213
Claire.

921
01:06:54.093 --> 01:06:55.177
Nari.

922
01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:11.485
Nari, what are you doing?

923
01:07:11.569 --> 01:07:13.821
How did you slip from our control?

924
01:07:13.904 --> 01:07:16.157
My friends set me free

925
01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.659
so I can stop you.

926
01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:32.339
Everybody back to the bus! Run, run!

927
01:07:39.930 --> 01:07:43.017
Oh, come on, start. Stupid bus.

928
01:08:10.669 --> 01:08:11.712
Get him, Nari!

929
01:08:35.027 --> 01:08:37.363
- Nari, get up.
- Look out.

930
01:08:37.446 --> 01:08:38.614
Nari, get out of the way.

931
01:09:07.935 --> 01:09:09.061
- No!
- Nari!

932
01:09:36.505 --> 01:09:38.549
No, no!

933
01:09:38.632 --> 01:09:40.426
Oh, no.

934
01:09:40.509 --> 01:09:41.719
Nari.

935
01:09:42.678 --> 01:09:43.929
Nari!

936
01:09:44.555 --> 01:09:45.389
Nari.

937
01:10:01.906 --> 01:10:02.906
Nari.

938
01:10:08.913 --> 01:10:11.790
<i>No more running.</i>

939
01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:20.049
She did it.

940
01:10:20.925 --> 01:10:23.302
Nari stopped them from uniting.

941
01:10:24.803 --> 01:10:27.640
<i>Apparently the Fire Titan
did not get the memo.</i>

942
01:10:27.723 --> 01:10:29.683
- Seklos and Gaylen.
- What?

943
01:10:29.767 --> 01:10:31.268
It's still marching.

944
01:10:32.686 --> 01:10:34.521
It's approaching Arcadia.

945
01:10:34.605 --> 01:10:37.399
But why? The three can no longer unite.

946
01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:40.110
Blinky, you're sure
you read the grimoire right?

947
01:10:40.194 --> 01:10:41.028
Of course.

948
01:10:41.111 --> 01:10:44.406
"When the three unite,
Earth will be reborn,

949
01:10:44.490 --> 01:10:47.534
back to the age of first creation,"
you see?

950
01:10:48.494 --> 01:10:50.204
Uh... Huh?

951
01:10:53.582 --> 01:10:56.835
"But if only one succeeds..."

952
01:10:56.919 --> 01:11:02.967
"That will be the element
from which the world will be reborn."

953
01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:06.220
You forgot to turn the page?

954
01:11:06.303 --> 01:11:08.889
It was stuck and moldy.

955
01:11:08.973 --> 01:11:11.016
And you didn't notice?

956
01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:13.644
You've got six eyes.

957
01:11:13.727 --> 01:11:15.896
The world was ending. I was rushed.

958
01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:17.940
That's why the Titans came to Arcadia.

959
01:11:18.023 --> 01:11:22.444
They didn't have to unite with each other.
They have to unite with the Heartstone.

960
01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:26.615
That actually makes horrible sense.

961
01:11:26.699 --> 01:11:30.661
The reason all of these trolls,
extraterrestrials, wizards

962
01:11:30.744 --> 01:11:34.415
happened to come here
is because under Arcadia

963
01:11:34.498 --> 01:11:38.544
is the only surviving
primordial Heartstone.

964
01:11:38.627 --> 01:11:43.173
As I said,
Arcadia is the center of the universe.

965
01:11:43.257 --> 01:11:46.218
You heard him.
I want Arcadia Oaks cleared now.

966
01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:48.220
This way, straight ahead.

967
01:12:09.575 --> 01:12:12.119
No! No more danger!

968
01:12:12.202 --> 01:12:14.663
Is there nowhere safe?!

969
01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:16.874
No, look out.

970
01:12:22.463 --> 01:12:23.672
<i>You got Excalibur?</i>

971
01:12:23.756 --> 01:12:27.176
Yeah, we've got it,
and a little something-something.

972
01:12:27.259 --> 01:12:29.470
- <i>Meet us in Arcadia.</i>
- Okay, right.

973
01:12:29.553 --> 01:12:33.098
What? Arcadia?
We just came from there.

974
01:12:34.558 --> 01:12:36.685
<i>Attention, all civilians.</i>

975
01:12:36.769 --> 01:12:39.772
<i>This is a mandatory evacuation
of Arcadia Oaks.</i>

976
01:12:41.857 --> 01:12:46.362
Yeah, now that's the way
you greet a taco truck.

977
01:12:46.445 --> 01:12:48.697
Move those barricades,
corporal.

978
01:12:48.781 --> 01:12:50.199
Right away, sir.

979
01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:02.127
- Go on, Jimbo. Take it.
- You got this.

980
01:13:03.629 --> 01:13:05.297
Come on, Jim. This is it.

981
01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:08.592
- This is your destiny.
- Go, Jim, go. Go, Jim, go.

982
01:13:08.675 --> 01:13:09.675
You can do it.

983
01:13:10.969 --> 01:13:12.721
Yes, pull.

984
01:13:17.017 --> 01:13:18.769
Come on, come on, come on.

985
01:13:20.396 --> 01:13:23.107
I can't watch.

986
01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:34.284
I really thought that was going to work.

987
01:13:35.744 --> 01:13:38.705
We gave your plan a try.

988
01:13:39.498 --> 01:13:42.418
When my ships arrive, we will evacuate.

989
01:13:43.377 --> 01:13:45.003
Uh, guys?

990
01:13:48.924 --> 01:13:51.009
Oh, my gosh.

991
01:13:51.552 --> 01:13:52.678
Now what?

992
01:14:07.025 --> 01:14:09.528
Oh, fuzzbuckets.

993
01:14:13.949 --> 01:14:15.409
Great Gronka Morka.

994
01:14:15.492 --> 01:14:16.827
Heartstone.

995
01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:21.498
My insides are coming out!

996
01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:26.253
By Gorgus! What else could go wrong?

997
01:14:26.336 --> 01:14:28.881
Take that back.
Childbirth's a beautiful thing.

998
01:14:28.964 --> 01:14:33.177
You cannot fight in this state,
my beautiful spherical Steve.

999
01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:35.429
But I can't leave him like this.

1000
01:14:35.512 --> 01:14:36.430
Don't worry.

1001
01:14:36.513 --> 01:14:37.848
I'll be by his side.

1002
01:14:38.807 --> 01:14:43.479
Wait, Aja.
Where do Akiridion babies come out of?

1003
01:14:44.062 --> 01:14:45.522
They come out of...

1004
01:14:47.191 --> 01:14:49.359
Okay, I've handled worse.

1005
01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:59.870
"The Trollhunter will know..."
What do I know?

1006
01:14:59.953 --> 01:15:03.540
"The Ninth Configuration."
Okay, nine. What is...?

1007
01:15:03.624 --> 01:15:04.958
Ninth Configuration?

1008
01:15:05.042 --> 01:15:07.127
The Ninth Configuration.

1009
01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:11.840
The Ninth Configuration.

1010
01:15:22.893 --> 01:15:26.438
The configuration is us.

1011
01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:30.317
- The nine of us.
- We can pull Excalibur together.

1012
01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:36.949
Everyone, put your hands on the stone.

1013
01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:38.325
Surround me.

1014
01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:27.207
Oh, I knew I shouldn't have taken
that bathroom break.

1015
01:16:27.791 --> 01:16:32.004
Take this back to Camelot.
Replace the amulet stone with Merlin's.

1016
01:16:32.087 --> 01:16:34.798
I know it goes unsaid, but make it quick.

1017
01:16:34.881 --> 01:16:36.216
Okay, right.

1018
01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:44.141
"Destiny is a gift."

1019
01:16:44.224 --> 01:16:46.893
Our loved ones gave their lives,

1020
01:16:46.977 --> 01:16:51.356
but we are here
in this very moment of quiet desperation.

1021
01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:55.402
We've learned that what feels like
a burden pushing down on our shoulders...

1022
01:16:55.485 --> 01:17:00.324
Is actually a sense of purpose
that lifts us to greater heights.

1023
01:17:00.407 --> 01:17:03.118
Wait, are you guys doing
that "hero speech" thing?

1024
01:17:03.201 --> 01:17:04.995
I love the "hero speech" thing.

1025
01:17:05.078 --> 01:17:09.041
Never forget that fear
is but the precursor to valor.

1026
01:17:09.124 --> 01:17:12.127
That to strive
and triumph in the face of fear

1027
01:17:12.210 --> 01:17:13.712
is what makes us heroes.

1028
01:17:13.795 --> 01:17:15.255
Don't think.

1029
01:17:15.339 --> 01:17:16.381
Become.

1030
01:17:38.278 --> 01:17:42.741
Ah, how I've missed driving.

1031
01:17:42.824 --> 01:17:45.911
If we stop Bellroc,
we'll stop the Fire Titan.

1032
01:17:45.994 --> 01:17:48.038
Blinky, we need to be right next to it.

1033
01:17:48.121 --> 01:17:52.376
You want us to get on top of that thing?
I can't get to the top of the rope in gym.

1034
01:17:52.459 --> 01:17:55.087
Don't worry, I've got just the thing.

1035
01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:56.880
<i>Lignum Aeternum.</i>

1036
01:17:56.963 --> 01:17:58.131
Whoa!

1037
01:17:58.215 --> 01:17:59.549
What was that?

1038
01:17:59.633 --> 01:18:01.134
I feel all tingly.

1039
01:18:01.218 --> 01:18:02.469
Uh, uh...

1040
01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:09.768
Some sort of magical stickum.
Varvatos approves.

1041
01:18:11.436 --> 01:18:13.939
Let's knock Bellroc off her perch.

1042
01:18:26.034 --> 01:18:27.869
Slow down, Blinky.

1043
01:18:27.953 --> 01:18:28.953
Get closer.

1044
01:18:29.454 --> 01:18:31.707
Prepare yourselves.

1045
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:33.291
Now!

1046
01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:36.002
All right, Trollhunters, get ready.

1047
01:18:36.086 --> 01:18:37.129
Now.

1048
01:18:39.214 --> 01:18:41.258
Oh, boy.

1049
01:18:44.886 --> 01:18:47.556
- Come on, Trollhunters!
- Yeah!

1050
01:18:47.639 --> 01:18:49.850
Godspeed, my valiant...

1051
01:18:49.933 --> 01:18:51.017
Come on!

1052
01:18:51.101 --> 01:18:56.273
Okay, I think he may have laid
that magic on a little too thick.

1053
01:18:56.356 --> 01:18:59.401
Why does this always
happen to me?

1054
01:19:08.368 --> 01:19:09.786
Aja, scout ahead.

1055
01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:10.871
On it.

1056
01:19:23.175 --> 01:19:25.761
What are you doing, Pepperjack?
Get back here!

1057
01:19:25.844 --> 01:19:27.554
Don't worry. I'm here.

1058
01:19:27.637 --> 01:19:29.848
- Creepslayerz for life.
- Yeah.

1059
01:19:29.931 --> 01:19:31.433
Creepslayerz for...

1060
01:19:33.018 --> 01:19:35.896
- It's happening!
- Breathe, breathe, breathe. Whoa!

1061
01:19:35.979 --> 01:19:38.607
My virgin eyes!

1062
01:19:43.278 --> 01:19:46.364
I take it back.
Childbirth is not so beautiful.

1063
01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:48.658
Oh, the humanity!

1064
01:20:17.854 --> 01:20:20.106
Trollhunters.

1065
01:20:20.190 --> 01:20:24.110
But you cannot hunt a god.

1066
01:20:34.162 --> 01:20:35.330
Jim!

1067
01:20:43.129 --> 01:20:44.589
Not good.

1068
01:20:54.057 --> 01:20:55.475
Begone.

1069
01:20:57.185 --> 01:20:58.436
Varvatos!

1070
01:21:07.571 --> 01:21:08.822
Aja!

1071
01:21:13.034 --> 01:21:15.495
- AAARRRGGHH!!! Get Aja. I got Krel.
- Go.

1072
01:21:19.624 --> 01:21:21.042
<i>Tenebrius Excilium.</i>

1073
01:21:25.046 --> 01:21:26.047
Got you.

1074
01:21:29.843 --> 01:21:32.053
Oh, no, no, no!

1075
01:21:32.971 --> 01:21:36.182
Stop sticking. Stop sticking.

1076
01:21:39.853 --> 01:21:42.397
Oh, hey, guys. Can you lend me a hand?

1077
01:21:43.481 --> 01:21:44.481
Bellroc!

1078
01:21:47.527 --> 01:21:48.987
This isn't over.

1079
01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:50.906
Trollhunter.

1080
01:21:54.367 --> 01:21:56.661
Come on, Stuart. Where are you?

1081
01:21:56.745 --> 01:21:58.705
Don't make them like they used to.
Come on.

1082
01:21:58.788 --> 01:22:01.666
Pop this stone into the amulet, et voilà.

1083
01:22:04.461 --> 01:22:07.923
Oh, come on.
You're supposed to be magical.

1084
01:22:34.115 --> 01:22:35.450
So weak.

1085
01:22:36.076 --> 01:22:39.955
So disappointing.

1086
01:22:40.038 --> 01:22:45.168
You are unworthy to face a god, child.

1087
01:22:53.134 --> 01:22:55.387
He's alone, no armor.

1088
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:57.514
We need to help him.

1089
01:22:57.597 --> 01:23:01.601
- Can you shadow-portal us back?
- I've tried. I'm spent.

1090
01:23:01.685 --> 01:23:04.896
Besides, Bellroc's magic is too strong.

1091
01:23:10.819 --> 01:23:12.904
Wait. Magic.

1092
01:23:15.073 --> 01:23:17.033
- Tobias!
- Toby!

1093
01:23:19.119 --> 01:23:22.706
Moral support.
Definitely the lamest superpower.

1094
01:23:33.633 --> 01:23:39.180
The world is but seconds away
from a glorious rebirth.

1095
01:23:39.264 --> 01:23:42.183
Don't spend that time here. Go.

1096
01:23:42.267 --> 01:23:46.604
Embrace your loved ones
for the final time.

1097
01:23:47.439 --> 01:23:50.066
No, I'm right where I need to be.

1098
01:23:50.150 --> 01:23:52.694
Then you will die alone.

1099
01:23:52.777 --> 01:23:55.947
You have no amulet, no armor.

1100
01:23:56.031 --> 01:24:00.660
And yet you still think yourself a hero?

1101
01:24:11.296 --> 01:24:14.090
The amulet didn't make me a hero.

1102
01:24:14.174 --> 01:24:15.759
I already was.

1103
01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:18.052
Eh?

1104
01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:25.435
Hmm. Such hubris.

1105
01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:30.565
Huzzah, I fixed it!

1106
01:24:45.163 --> 01:24:48.833
Yeah, Jimbo!

1107
01:25:05.683 --> 01:25:07.102
For the good of all,

1108
01:25:07.185 --> 01:25:09.771
Daylight is mine to command!

1109
01:25:33.419 --> 01:25:35.505
Is that all you got?

1110
01:26:14.586 --> 01:26:20.091
No!

1111
01:26:28.516 --> 01:26:29.726
Your turn.

1112
01:26:29.809 --> 01:26:30.810
Give up.

1113
01:26:30.894 --> 01:26:34.063
It's too late.

1114
01:26:34.147 --> 01:26:37.650
The world will be remade.

1115
01:27:18.274 --> 01:27:20.443
My... My magic.

1116
01:27:21.694 --> 01:27:23.863
I'm powerless.

1117
01:27:23.947 --> 01:27:24.948
Don't worry.

1118
01:27:26.616 --> 01:27:28.159
You get used to it.

1119
01:28:13.037 --> 01:28:13.871
Jim?

1120
01:28:13.955 --> 01:28:15.331
- Jim?
- Jim?

1121
01:28:15.415 --> 01:28:17.333
- Where are you?
- I don't see him.

1122
01:28:17.417 --> 01:28:18.459
Jim!

1123
01:28:18.543 --> 01:28:19.544
Master Jim.

1124
01:28:19.627 --> 01:28:21.170
Where is he?

1125
01:28:21.254 --> 01:28:22.547
Jim?

1126
01:28:28.594 --> 01:28:30.555
- Huzzah!
- Jim!

1127
01:28:35.476 --> 01:28:37.687
Victory!

1128
01:28:39.063 --> 01:28:41.232
I missed all the good stuff, didn't I?

1129
01:28:41.316 --> 01:28:44.360
Eli. Where's Steve? Is he all right?

1130
01:28:44.444 --> 01:28:45.445
He's fine.

1131
01:28:45.528 --> 01:28:50.992
And so are Maja, Baja,
Taja, Faja, Daja, Waja, and Eli, Jr.

1132
01:28:51.659 --> 01:28:54.287
The Palchuk has some stretch marks.

1133
01:29:00.376 --> 01:29:02.462
You must be Eli, Jr.

1134
01:29:02.545 --> 01:29:03.545
Hello.

1135
01:29:05.965 --> 01:29:07.258
I knew you could do it.

1136
01:29:07.342 --> 01:29:08.426
It was Toby.

1137
01:29:08.509 --> 01:29:11.346
He used the un-magic generator and...

1138
01:29:11.429 --> 01:29:12.429
And...

1139
01:29:13.306 --> 01:29:14.306
Tobes?

1140
01:29:15.058 --> 01:29:16.309
Tobes?

1141
01:29:17.352 --> 01:29:19.020
No.

1142
01:29:21.439 --> 01:29:22.439
Tobes.

1143
01:29:23.274 --> 01:29:24.192
Oh, no.

1144
01:29:24.275 --> 01:29:25.485
Tobes!

1145
01:29:28.988 --> 01:29:30.782
Tobes. Tobes.

1146
01:29:32.784 --> 01:29:33.826
Tobes!

1147
01:29:41.667 --> 01:29:42.667
Oh, no.

1148
01:29:46.172 --> 01:29:47.006
No!

1149
01:29:47.090 --> 01:29:49.258
Wingman.

1150
01:29:53.387 --> 01:29:54.972
Tobes.

1151
01:29:55.056 --> 01:29:57.183
Jimbo.

1152
01:29:58.184 --> 01:30:00.144
Did we save the world?

1153
01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:03.898
Yeah, we did.

1154
01:30:03.981 --> 01:30:05.566
Tobes, we'll fix you.

1155
01:30:05.650 --> 01:30:09.153
We'll get you a doctor
or magic or alien tech.

1156
01:30:09.237 --> 01:30:11.364
Master Jim, I'm afraid...

1157
01:30:11.447 --> 01:30:13.366
No, there's gotta be a way.

1158
01:30:13.449 --> 01:30:15.201
There's always a way.

1159
01:30:16.577 --> 01:30:18.037
Here, take this.

1160
01:30:18.704 --> 01:30:20.665
Use this. You can't just give up.

1161
01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:23.167
I'm not giving up, Jimbo.

1162
01:30:23.835 --> 01:30:25.128
You taught me that.

1163
01:30:26.337 --> 01:30:28.798
You all taught me so much,

1164
01:30:28.881 --> 01:30:31.217
gave me so much.

1165
01:30:33.678 --> 01:30:34.971
Wingman.

1166
01:30:35.054 --> 01:30:36.639
It's okay, buddy.

1167
01:30:38.724 --> 01:30:41.644
Please, Tobes, you can't leave me.

1168
01:30:41.727 --> 01:30:43.563
You've always been with me.

1169
01:30:44.188 --> 01:30:45.606
Always have been,

1170
01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:48.025
always will be.

1171
01:30:50.027 --> 01:30:53.364
It was the two of us at the start.

1172
01:30:53.447 --> 01:30:57.034
It'll be the two of us at the end.

1173
01:30:57.994 --> 01:30:59.829
It's okay, Jimbo.

1174
01:30:59.912 --> 01:31:01.414
I didn't think.

1175
01:31:01.497 --> 01:31:02.957
I became.

1176
01:31:07.879 --> 01:31:09.297
Tobes.

1177
01:31:11.090 --> 01:31:13.342
Tobes!

1178
01:31:32.195 --> 01:31:34.071
Don't look, my old friend.

1179
01:31:39.785 --> 01:31:41.078
Domzalski.

1180
01:31:49.837 --> 01:31:53.174
<i>Trollhunter make Ninth Configuration.</i>

1181
01:31:53.257 --> 01:31:56.719
<i>- Krohnisfere will make right.</i>
- "Krohnisfere will make right."

1182
01:32:12.777 --> 01:32:14.528
The time stone.

1183
01:32:16.239 --> 01:32:19.158
What if it wasn't the Titans
this was meant to make right?

1184
01:32:19.784 --> 01:32:20.993
What do you mean?

1185
01:32:21.077 --> 01:32:24.205
"Time unfolds differently, like a flower."

1186
01:32:24.288 --> 01:32:26.499
"Only the Trollhunter will know."

1187
01:32:27.083 --> 01:32:28.376
Know what?

1188
01:32:28.459 --> 01:32:29.752
What really happened.

1189
01:32:29.835 --> 01:32:32.588
"Time unfolds differently."

1190
01:32:32.672 --> 01:32:36.509
If I go back,
things will happen differently.

1191
01:32:37.134 --> 01:32:38.886
And maybe it'll be worse.

1192
01:32:38.970 --> 01:32:41.430
We barely saved the world this time.

1193
01:32:41.514 --> 01:32:45.476
But at the cost of so many we hold dear.

1194
01:32:45.559 --> 01:32:48.312
Nomura, Nari, Strickler.

1195
01:32:48.396 --> 01:32:49.689
Tobias.

1196
01:32:50.606 --> 01:32:53.651
But if things can happen differently,

1197
01:32:53.734 --> 01:32:55.361
Jim can save them all.

1198
01:33:00.199 --> 01:33:02.326
"For the good of all."

1199
01:33:05.204 --> 01:33:06.831
No matter what happens,

1200
01:33:06.914 --> 01:33:09.709
if it's meant to be, it will be.

1201
01:33:09.792 --> 01:33:12.295
Master Jim, if you do this,

1202
01:33:12.378 --> 01:33:16.299
you alone will be burdened
by what could have been.

1203
01:33:16.382 --> 01:33:19.677
Shouldering burdens is what heroes do.

1204
01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:21.053
You taught me that.

1205
01:33:22.930 --> 01:33:25.850
I have cherished every moment with you.

1206
01:33:27.018 --> 01:33:30.354
In these few years,
you have grown into a man.

1207
01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:34.233
A man of courage, wisdom and honor.

1208
01:33:35.484 --> 01:33:37.403
I could not be prouder of you

1209
01:33:37.486 --> 01:33:39.530
if you were my own son.

1210
01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:46.203
I will see you again, James Lake, Jr.

1211
01:33:46.287 --> 01:33:48.372
Somewhere, sometime,

1212
01:33:48.456 --> 01:33:51.500
our story will continue.

1213
01:33:52.543 --> 01:33:56.797
And if we are meant to meet,
our stars will align.

1214
01:33:58.132 --> 01:33:59.300
We believe that.

1215
01:34:13.064 --> 01:34:14.940
Whatever happens,

1216
01:34:15.024 --> 01:34:16.567
don't give up on me.

1217
01:34:17.568 --> 01:34:20.780
Don't stop trying until I love you.

1218
01:34:21.906 --> 01:34:26.911
If we're meant to be,
I will always be here... and here.

1219
01:35:02.446 --> 01:35:06.075
Whatever happens next,
I'll make sure this isn't goodbye.

1220
01:35:10.704 --> 01:35:12.248
I promise.

1221
01:35:28.097 --> 01:35:30.266
I... It worked.

1222
01:35:30.349 --> 01:35:31.392
It worked!

1223
01:35:38.732 --> 01:35:41.819
Tobes was here when the raccoons
knocked the trash over.

1224
01:35:42.361 --> 01:35:43.487
Where is he?

1225
01:35:50.995 --> 01:35:52.496
Come on, Tobes.

1226
01:36:06.427 --> 01:36:08.345
Morning, Jimbo.

1227
01:36:08.429 --> 01:36:09.513
Toby.

1228
01:36:11.891 --> 01:36:13.184
Oh! Oh!

1229
01:36:13.267 --> 01:36:15.978
You seem really happy to see me.

1230
01:36:16.061 --> 01:36:18.939
Are you doing okay, Jim?

1231
01:36:19.023 --> 01:36:21.567
It sure feels good to be back.

1232
01:36:23.777 --> 01:36:26.906
Um... okay.

1233
01:36:26.989 --> 01:36:31.076
Does, uh, this mean you
didn't make any meat loaf for lunch, then?

1234
01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:33.162
- Are you climbing the rope?
- Hang on.

1235
01:36:33.245 --> 01:36:35.039
Get away from it. Don't hug it.

1236
01:36:35.122 --> 01:36:36.916
- Do you love the rope?
- Come on, Tobes.

1237
01:36:38.209 --> 01:36:40.961
Pepperjack, get off the floor!

1238
01:36:41.045 --> 01:36:42.713
Hup, two, three, four.

1239
01:36:44.173 --> 01:36:48.219
So, uh, the school play,
I hear they're looking for people.

1240
01:36:48.302 --> 01:36:50.012
Have at it, Romeo.

1241
01:36:50.095 --> 01:36:51.555
I'd keep climbing.

1242
01:36:51.639 --> 01:36:52.973
Jimbo!

1243
01:36:53.057 --> 01:36:54.850
Hey, nice job, Domzalski.

1244
01:36:54.934 --> 01:36:55.935
Yeah!

1245
01:36:56.018 --> 01:36:57.436
<i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

1246
01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:01.857
You never showed much interest
in the theater before, Young Atlas.

1247
01:37:01.941 --> 01:37:03.400
Yeah, I don't know.

1248
01:37:03.484 --> 01:37:06.570
Something tells me
this will be worth my while.

1249
01:37:08.781 --> 01:37:12.660
Anyway, I wanted to come by
to ask you if you'd come over for dinner.

1250
01:37:12.743 --> 01:37:15.204
- Dinner?
- I'd like to introduce you to my mom.

1251
01:37:17.081 --> 01:37:19.416
My orthodontist says
I'm almost done with my braces.

1252
01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:21.877
Only four more years.

1253
01:37:21.961 --> 01:37:26.048
Uh, I'm going home before Steve
finds something big enough to shove me in.

1254
01:37:26.131 --> 01:37:27.591
Good luck with the audition.

1255
01:37:30.261 --> 01:37:31.261
Hey, Tobes.

1256
01:37:31.971 --> 01:37:32.971
Yeah, Jimbo?

1257
01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:34.974
Take the canal.

1258
01:37:35.057 --> 01:37:38.060
Maybe you'll stumble
upon something interesting.

1259
01:37:38.143 --> 01:37:40.020
Yeah, right, Jim.

1260
01:37:40.104 --> 01:37:42.439
Nothing interesting
ever happens in Arcadia.

1261
01:37:45.192 --> 01:37:49.405
I'm James Lake, Jr.,
here to try out for the part of Romeo.

1262
01:37:49.488 --> 01:37:51.448
Go ahead, Mr. Lake.

1263
01:37:58.831 --> 01:38:00.749
Destiny...

1264
01:38:03.085 --> 01:38:05.170
<i>Destiny is a gift.</i>

1265
01:38:07.381 --> 01:38:09.758
<i>Some go their entire lives</i>

1266
01:38:09.842 --> 01:38:12.636
<i>living an existence of quiet desperation.</i>

1267
01:38:14.263 --> 01:38:16.307
<i>Never learning the truth.</i>

1268
01:38:16.974 --> 01:38:21.061
That what feels as though a burden
pushing down upon our shoulders

1269
01:38:21.145 --> 01:38:25.482
is actually the sense of purpose
that lifts us to greater heights.

1270
01:38:27.276 --> 01:38:31.363
<i>Never forget that fear
is but the precursor to valor.</i>

1271
01:38:32.281 --> 01:38:35.492
<i>That to strive
and triumph in the face of fear</i>

1272
01:38:35.576 --> 01:38:38.245
<i>is what it means to be a hero.</i>

1273
01:38:40.914 --> 01:38:42.082
Whoa.

1274
01:38:42.166 --> 01:38:44.043
<i>Don't think.</i>

1275
01:38:44.126 --> 01:38:47.338
<i>Tobias Domzalski.</i>

1276
01:38:48.631 --> 01:38:49.632
<i>Become.</i>

1277
01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:53.135
Awesomesauce!
