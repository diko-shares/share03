1
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.910
U.S.S. Kelvin, go for Starfleet Base.

2
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.870
Starfleet Base, we've sent you
a transmission. Did you receive?

3
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.370
Kelvin, have you double-checked
those readings?

4
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.330
Our gravitational sensors are
going crazy here. You should see this.

5
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.670
It looks like a lightning storm.

6
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.210
What you've sent us
doesn't seem possible.

7
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.550
Yes, ma'am. I understand.
That's why we sent it.

8
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.720
- Report.
- It's still out of visual range.

9
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.680
- Give me 20 seconds.
- Alert Captain Robau

10
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.930
that Starfleet advises your ship
to proceed with caution.

11
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.390
Polarise the viewscreen.

12
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.930
Could whatever this is
be of Klingon origin?

13
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.390
Captain, we have visual.

14
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.480
- Repeat. Could this be Klingon?
- Negative, Lieutenant.

15
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.020
You're 75,000 kilometres from...

16
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.980
Captain, are you seeing this?

17
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.650
My God.

18
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.090
I have a reading.

19
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.050
- They've locked weapons on us!
- Red alert!

20
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.220
Torpedo locked on us at 320 degrees,

21
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.350
- mark 2.
- Arm weapons!

22
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.100
Evasive pattern Delta-five!

23
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.310
Incoming fast!

24
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.320
Fire all phasers! Damage report.

25
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.580
Warp drive's been knocked out!
Never seen anything like it.

26
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.790
Weapons are off-line. Main power 38%.

27
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.750
- They're firing another!
- All power to forward shields!

28
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.010
Lieutenant!

29
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.810
Atmospheric stabilisation has been lost.

30
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.850
- Were our shields even up?
- Oxygen failing, Decks 7 to 13.

31
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.850
- We have confirmed casualties, sir.
- Shields 11% and dropping.

32
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.440
Ten percent. Shields at nine.
We're dropping here.

33
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.900
All remaining power to forward shields.
Prepare shuttles for evacuation.

34
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.190
Hello.

35
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.070
My commander requests
the presence of your Captain

36
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.530
in order to negotiate a cease-fire.

37
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.540
You will come aboard our ship
via shuttlecraft.

38
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.290
Your refusal would be unwise.

39
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.430
Walk with me.

40
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.650
If I don't report in 15 minutes,
evacuate the crew.

41
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.440
- Sir, we could issue...
- There is no help for us out here.

42
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.980
Use autopilot.

43
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.700
- And get off this ship.
- Aye, Captain.

44
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.990
You're Captain now, Mr Kirk.

45
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.070
His heart rate's elevated.

46
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.170
Look at this ship.

47
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.590
- Are you familiar with this craft?
- Who is your commander?

48
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.770
- Is it him?
- I will speak for Captain Nero.

49
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.560
Then ask Captain Nero what gives him
the right to attack a Federation vessel.

50
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.950
Do you know the location
of Ambassador Spock?

51
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.880
I'm unfamiliar with Ambassador Spock.

52
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.300
- What is the current stardate?
- Stardate?

53
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.090
Twenty-two thirty-three zero-four.

54
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.640
Where are you from?

55
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.980
Sir, they're locked on our signal.
They're launching again!

56
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.610
Bravo-six manoeuvre! Fire full spread!

57
00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.660
- Seventeen more out!
- I'm initiating General Order 13!

58
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.500
- We're evacuating!
- Yes, sir!

59
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.050
All decks, this is the Captain speaking.
Evacuate the ship immediately.

60
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.090
Get to your designated shuttlecraft.
Repeat. Evacuate...

61
00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.010
That's George's voice.
What's happening?

62
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.510
You'll deliver in the shuttle. Go!

63
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:22.190
Move! This one's closed!
Let's go! Get him up!

64
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.690
I'm on my way!

65
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.070
- George.
- You're okay. Thank God.

66
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.200
I have medical shuttle 37 standing by.
Get to it now. Can you do that?

67
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.110
- Yes.
- Everything's gonna be okay.

68
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.290
- Do exactly as I say. Shuttle 37.
- George, it's coming.

69
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.540
- Our baby, it's coming now.
- I'm on my way.

70
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.590
Autopilot function has been destroyed.

71
00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.170
Manual operation only.

72
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.720
Clear those decks now!
Get to the shuttles! Move, move, move!

73
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.060
Get to the hangar deck!
Get to the hangar deck! Let's move it!

74
00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.390
- That was a big one.
- Just keep breathing. You'll be fine.

75
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.270
- And the baby, too, right?
- And the baby, too.

76
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:11.900
Right here. Go ahead and sit back.

77
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.580
Captain to shuttle 37.
Is my wife onboard?

78
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.330
- Yes, sir, she is.
- I need you to go now. Do you hear me?

79
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:24.040
- We're waiting on you, sir.
- No, just go. Take off immediately.

80
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.290
- That's an order.
- Yes, sir.

81
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.250
No, wait! We can't go yet!

82
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:33.630
Please stop! Stop!

83
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:38.390
George? The shuttle's leaving.
Where are you?

84
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:39.970
Sweetheart, listen to me.

85
00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.730
I'm not gonna be there.

86
00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:44.980
- No.
- This is the only way you'll survive.

87
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.730
Are you still on the ship?
You have to be here!

88
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.940
The shuttles will never make it
if I don't fight them off.

89
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.070
George, I can't do this without you.

90
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:55.530
Okay, I need you to push now.

91
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:14.740
- What is it?
- It's a boy.

92
00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:16.280
A boy?

93
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.030
Tell me about him.

94
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:21.700
He's beautiful.

95
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.370
George, you should be here.

96
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.460
Impact alert.

97
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:34.090
- What are we gonna call him?
- We can name him after your father.

98
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.590
"Tiberius"? You kidding me?
No, that's the worst.

99
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:42.470
Let's name him after your dad.
Let's call him Jim.

100
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.980
Jim. Okay. Jim it is.

101
00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.900
- Sweetheart, can you hear me?
- I hear you!

102
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.700
I love you so much. I love you...

103
00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.940
Hey, are you out of your mind?
That car is an antique.

104
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.610
You think you can get away with this
just 'cause your mother's off planet?

105
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.070
You get your ass back home now!

106
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.830
You live in my house, buddy.
You live in my house, and that's my car.

107
00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:30.830
You get one scratch on that car,
and I'm gonna whip your...

108
00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.510
Yeah!

109
00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.400
Hey, Johnny!

110
00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.710
Citizen! Pull over.

111
00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.240
No!

112
00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.270
Is there a problem, Officer?

113
00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:17.940
Citizen, what is your name?

114
00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.730
My name is James Tiberius Kirk.

115
00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.630
What is the formula
for the volume of a sphere?

116
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:44.340
Four-thirds pi times the radius cubed.

117
00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:45.710
One-point-two-six.

118
00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:46.840
An ellipse.

119
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:48.760
What is the electrical charge
of an up-type quark?

120
00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.640
Positive two-thirds.

121
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:55.600
What is the square root of 2,396,324?

122
00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.560
- 1,548.
- What is the dimensionality...

123
00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.350
Dimensionality equals the logarithm
and divided by...

124
00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.190
Non-excludability and non-rivalry...
Four-thirds pi times the radius cubed.

125
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.990
When it is morally praiseworthy
but not morally obligatory.

126
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.320
Spock!

127
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:17.500
I presume you've prepared
new insults for today.

128
00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:19.210
Affirmative.

129
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:31.050
This is your thirty-fifth attempt to elicit
an emotional response from me.

130
00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:34.180
You're neither human nor Vulcan, and
therefore have no place in this universe.

131
00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.140
Look. He has human eyes.
They look sad, don't they?

132
00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.730
Perhaps an emotional response
requires physical stimuli.

133
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:47.480
He's a traitor, you know. Your father.
For marrying her. That human whore.

134
00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:18.100
They called you a traitor.

135
00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.360
Emotions run deep within our race.

136
00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.860
In many ways,
more deeply than in humans.

137
00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.530
Logic offers a serenity
humans seldom experience.

138
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:37.740
The control of feelings,
so that they do not control you.

139
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:44.040
You suggest
that I should be completely Vulcan,

140
00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.710
and yet, you married a human.

141
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.920
As ambassador to Earth, it is my duty

142
00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.760
to observe
and understand human behaviour.

143
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.090
Marrying your mother was

144
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:56.930
logical.

145
00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:04.270
Spock. You are fully capable
of deciding your own destiny.

146
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:10.440
The question you face is,
which path will you choose?

147
00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.610
This is something only you can decide.

148
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.830
Spock, come here, let me see you.

149
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.500
- No.
- Spock.

150
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:39.760
There's no need to be anxious.
You'll do fine.

151
00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.180
I am hardly anxious, Mother.

152
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:46.020
And "fine" has variable definitions.
"Fine" is unacceptable.

153
00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:47.980
Okay.

154
00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.870
- May I ask a personal query?
- Anything.

155
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.460
Should I choose to complete
the Vulcan discipline of Kolinahr

156
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
and purge all emotion,

157
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.340
I trust you will not feel
it reflects judgement upon you.

158
00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:17.680
Spock.

159
00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:23.520
As always, whatever you choose to be,

160
00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.810
you will have a proud mother.

161
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:35.240
You have surpassed the expectations
of your instructors.

162
00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.200
Your final record is flawless,
with one exception.

163
00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:43.370
I see that you have applied
to Starfleet as well.

164
00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:45.790
It was logical
to cultivate multiple options.

165
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:47.960
Logical, but unnecessary.

166
00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:51.130
You are hereby accepted
to the Vulcan Science Academy.

167
00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:52.710
It is truly remarkable, Spock,

168
00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:56.130
that you have achieved so much
despite your disadvantage.

169
00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.130
All rise!

170
00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:04.180
If you would clarify, Minister,

171
00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:08.560
- to what disadvantage are you referring?
- Your human mother.

172
00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:16.820
Council. Ministers, I must decline.

173
00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.660
No Vulcan has ever declined
admission to this Academy.

174
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.490
Then as I am half human,
your record remains untarnished.

175
00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:26.240
Spock, you have made a commitment
to honour the Vulcan way.

176
00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.660
Why did you come
before this council today?

177
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:31.330
Was it to satisfy
your emotional need to rebel?

178
00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.500
The only emotion I wish to convey
is gratitude.

179
00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:39.090
Thank you, Ministers,
for your consideration.

180
00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:42.840
Live long and prosper.

181
00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.030
- How are you?
- Hey.

182
00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:06.200
- Hi.
- Hi.

183
00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:17.130
Hi, I'd like a Klabnian Fire Tea,
three Budweiser Classics,

184
00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:21.130
- two Cardassian Sunrises and...
- Gotta try the Slusho. It's good.

185
00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.800
The Slusho mix. Thank you.

186
00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.600
That's a lot of drinks for one woman.

187
00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.810
- And a shot of Jack, straight up.
- Make that two. Her shot's on me.

188
00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:32.060
Her shot's on her. Thanks but no thanks.

189
00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.900
Don't you want to at least
know my name

190
00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:35.480
before you completely reject me?

191
00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.650
- I'm fine without it.
- You are fine without it.

192
00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.900
It's Jim. Jim Kirk.

193
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:46.320
If you don't tell me your name,
I'm gonna have to make one up.

194
00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.830
- It's Uhura.
- Uhura? No way!

195
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:51.410
That's the name
I was gonna make up for you.

196
00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.830
- Uhura what?
- Just Uhura.

197
00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.500
They don't have last names
in your world?

198
00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.000
Uhura is my last name.

199
00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:00.300
Well, they don't have first names
in your world?

200
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.010
Excuse me, buddy.

201
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:06.180
So, you're a cadet, you're studying.
What's your focus?

202
00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.760
Xenolinguistics.
You have no idea what that means.

203
00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:13.520
The study of alien languages.
Morphology, phonology, syntax.

204
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:16.980
It means you've got a talented tongue.

205
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:19.020
I'm impressed.

206
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:21.110
For a moment there,
I thought you were just a dumb hick

207
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:26.110
- who only has sex with farm animals.
- Well, not only.

208
00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:29.700
This townie isn't bothering you, right?

209
00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:32.290
Beyond belief.
But it's nothing I can't handle.

210
00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.370
You could handle me.
That's an invitation.

211
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:38.790
- Hey, you better mind your manners.
- Relax, cupcake. It was a joke.

212
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:43.550
Hey, farm boy. Maybe you can't count,
but there are four of us and one of you.

213
00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:47.220
So get some more guys,
and then it'll be an even fight.

214
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:52.060
Guys, stop it.

215
00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.850
Stop it!

216
00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:18.580
Enough!

217
00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:27.680
Guys, he's had enough!

218
00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:34.930
Outside, all of you.

219
00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:37.440
- Now!
- Yes, sir!

220
00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.600
- He wouldn't even listen!
- I just bought a drink.

221
00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:41.610
- Can you believe this?
- It's not really fair.

222
00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:44.280
- Come on.
- You all right, son?

223
00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.200
You can whistle really loud,
you know that?

224
00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.700
You know, I couldn't believe it when
the bartender told me who you are.

225
00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.870
- And who am I, Captain Pike?
- Your father's son.

226
00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:59.040
Can I get another one?

227
00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.880
For my dissertation,
I was assigned the U. S. S. Kelvin.

228
00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:06.130
Something I admired about your dad,
he didn't believe in no-win scenarios.

229
00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:07.630
He sure learned his lesson.

230
00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.380
Well, it depends
on how you define winning.

231
00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:11.720
- You're here, aren't you?
- Thanks.

232
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.810
You know, that instinct to leap
without looking, that was his nature, too.

233
00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:17.230
And in my opinion,
it's something Starfleet's lost.

234
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:20.230
- Why are you talking to me, man?
- 'Cause I looked up your file

235
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:22.980
while you were drooling on the floor.

236
00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:26.820
Your aptitude tests are off the charts.
So what is it?

237
00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.650
You like being the only genius-level
repeat-offender in the Midwest?

238
00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.490
Maybe I love it.

239
00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:35.330
So your dad dies. You can settle
for a less-than-ordinary life.

240
00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:38.910
Or do you feel like you were meant
for something better?

241
00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:40.960
Something special?

242
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.300
- Enlist in Starfleet.
- Enlist?

243
00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.420
You guys must be way down
on your recruiting quota for the month.

244
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:53.680
If you're half the man your father was,
Jim, Starfleet could use you.

245
00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:58.680
You can be an officer in four years.
You can have your own ship in eight.

246
00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:02.350
You understand what the Federation is,
don't you? It's important.

247
00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.440
It's a peacekeeping
and humanitarian armada...

248
00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.440
- Are we done?
- I'm done.

249
00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:16.530
Riverside Shipyard. Shuttle for
new recruits leaves tomorrow, 0800.

250
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:24.170
Now, your father was captain
of a starship for 12 minutes.

251
00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:29.380
He saved 800 lives,
including your mother's. And yours.

252
00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:32.630
I dare you to do better.

253
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:58.970
Nice ride, man.

254
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:04.230
It's yours.

255
00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:07.560
Four years? I'll do it in three.

256
00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.000
At ease, gentlemen.

257
00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:47.230
- Never did get that first name.
- You need a doctor.

258
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:49.440
I told you people, I don't need a doctor,
damn it, I am a doctor!

259
00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:50.560
You need to get back to your seat.

260
00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:51.730
I had one in the bathroom
with no windows.

261
00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.900
- You need to get back to your seat now.
- I suffer from aviaphobia.

262
00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:55.490
It means fear of dying
in something that flies.

263
00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:59.700
Sir, for your own safety, sit down,
or else I'll make you sit down!

264
00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.240
- Fine.
- Thank you.

265
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:08.330
This is Captain Pike.
We've been cleared for takeoff.

266
00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.250
I may throw up on you.

267
00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:12.590
I think these things are pretty safe.

268
00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:15.090
Don't pander to me, kid.
One tiny crack in the hull

269
00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:17.470
and our blood boils in 13 seconds.

270
00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:20.430
A solar flare might crop up,
cook us in our seats.

271
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:23.430
And wait till you're sitting pretty
with a case of Andorian shingles.

272
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:26.850
See if you're still so relaxed
when your eyeballs are bleeding.

273
00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:30.520
Space is disease and danger
wrapped in darkness and silence.

274
00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:34.440
Well, I hate to break this to you,
but Starfleet operates in space.

275
00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.610
Yeah, well, I got nowhere else to go.

276
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:40.030
The ex-wife took the whole damn planet
in the divorce.

277
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:42.200
All I got left is my bones.

278
00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:51.460
- Jim Kirk.
- McCoy. Leonard McCoy.

279
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:42.430
Captain Nero! You've been
requested on the Bridge, sir.

280
00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:44.340
Ayel says it's time.

281
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:54.770
Sir, we've arrived at the coordinates
you calculated. There's nothing here.

282
00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:57.150
- What are your orders?
- We wait.

283
00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:01.610
We wait for the one
who allowed our home to be destroyed,

284
00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:04.070
as we've been doing for 25 years.

285
00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:08.160
- And once we've killed him?
- Kill him?

286
00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:12.120
I'm not gonna kill him.
I'm gonna make him watch.

287
00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:27.890
Capture that ship!

288
00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.310
Welcome back, Spock.

289
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.600
Why are you so happy?

290
00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:39.070
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No, I don't suppose you do.

291
00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:40.650
Hello, ladies!

292
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:42.900
- I'm taking the test again.
- You gotta be kidding.

293
00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:44.740
Yeah, tomorrow morning,
and I want you there.

294
00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:45.990
You know, I've got better things to do

295
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:48.160
than watch you embarrass yourself
for a third time.

296
00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.660
I'm a doctor, Jim. I'm busy.

297
00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:52.040
Bones, it doesn't bother you
that no one's ever passed the test?

298
00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.790
Jim, it's the Kobayashi Maru.
No one passes the test.

299
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:57.960
And no one goes back for seconds,
let alone thirds.

300
00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.540
I gotta study.

301
00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:01.920
Study, my ass.

302
00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:09.640
- Jim, I think I love you.
- That is so weird.

303
00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:12.020
- Lights.
- Lights on.

304
00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:14.390
Did you just say, "That is so weird"?

305
00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.560
- Yeah, I did, but...
- You don't love me, too?

306
00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.980
Oh, my God, my roommate!

307
00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:19.270
But I thought you said
she was gone for the night.

308
00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.230
Obviously she's not.
Quick, get under the bed.

309
00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.940
- Under...
- Look, just get under the bed.

310
00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:24.690
- Come on!
- She can't see you here.

311
00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:26.200
- Why not?
- Because I promised her

312
00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.530
- I'd stop bringing guys back to the room.
- Really?

313
00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:30.330
- Well, how many guys have you...
- Just down! Just down!

314
00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:33.660
- Hey.
- Hey.

315
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:35.200
- How are you?
- Good.

316
00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:38.370
The strangest thing,
I was in the long-range sensor lab...

317
00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.250
Yeah, I thought all night.

318
00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:44.710
I was tracking solar systems and
I picked up an emergency transmission.

319
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.470
- Really?
- Yeah. From a Klingon prison planet.

320
00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:50.090
- No.
- Yeah.

321
00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.720
A Klingon armada was destroyed.
Forty-seven ships.

322
00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:55.810
So you're not going back
to the lab tonight?

323
00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:01.480
- Gaila, who is he?
- Who's who?

324
00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.860
The mouth-breather
hiding under your bed.

325
00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:05.490
You could hear me breathing?

326
00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:07.150
- You!
- Big day tomorrow.

327
00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.950
- You're gonna fail. Get out.
- Gaila, see you around.

328
00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:11.490
If I pass,
will you tell me your first name?

329
00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:13.330
- No! Good night.
- I think the fact

330
00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:16.160
that you picked up a transmission
is very interesting.

331
00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:21.460
We are receiving a distress signal
from the U. S. S. Kobayashi Maru.

332
00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:23.500
The ship has lost power
and is stranded.

333
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:25.510
Starfleet Command
has ordered us to rescue them.

334
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:28.630
"Starfleet Command has ordered us
to rescue them,

335
00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:31.090
"Captain."

336
00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:33.890
Two Klingon vessels
have entered the Neutral Zone

337
00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:36.770
- and are locking weapons on us.
- That's okay.

338
00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.560
- That's okay?
- Yeah, don't worry about it.

339
00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.110
Did he say, "Don't worry about it"?

340
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:44.020
Is he not taking
the simulation seriously?

341
00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.240
Three more Klingon warbirds decloaking
and targeting our ship.

342
00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.950
- I don't suppose this is a problem either.
- They're firing, Captain.

343
00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.030
Alert Medical Bay to prepare to receive
all crew members

344
00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.240
from the damaged ship.

345
00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:56.080
And how do you expect us
to rescue them

346
00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.870
when we're surrounded
by Klingons, Captain?

347
00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.460
Alert Medical.

348
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:05.290
Our ship is being hit. Shields at 60%.

349
00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:07.460
- I understand.
- Well, should we, I don't know,

350
00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:09.050
fire back?

351
00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.130
- No.
- Of course not.

352
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:20.730
What is this? What's going on?

353
00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:26.570
Arm photons.
Prepare to fire on the Klingon warbirds.

354
00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:28.820
- Yes, sir.
- Jim, their shields are still up.

355
00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.150
Are they?

356
00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:33.570
No. They're not.

357
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:35.660
Fire on all enemy ships.

358
00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:38.410
One photon each should do.
Let's not waste ammunition.

359
00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:41.410
Target locked and acquired
on all warbirds. Firing.

360
00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.920
- All ships destroyed, Captain.
- Begin rescue of the stranded crew.

361
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:52.720
So! We've managed to eliminate
all enemy ships,

362
00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:54.430
no one onboard was injured,

363
00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:59.890
and the successful rescue of the
Kobayashi Maru crew is underway.

364
00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.230
How the hell did that kid beat your test?

365
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.400
I do not know.

366
00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:15.620
This session has been called
to resolve a troubling matter.

367
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:18.120
James T. Kirk, step forward.

368
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:22.790
Cadet Kirk, evidence has been
submitted to this council

369
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:25.630
suggesting that you violated
the ethical code of conduct

370
00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:29.210
pursuant to Regulation 17.43
of the Starfleet code.

371
00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:33.800
Is there anything you care to say
before we begin, sir?

372
00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:38.390
Yes, I believe I have the right

373
00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:38.390
to face my accuser directly.

374
00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.560
Step forward, please.

375
00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:48.810
This is Commander Spock. He is one
of our most distinguished graduates.

376
00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:52.860
He's programmed the Kobayashi Maru
exam for the last four years.

377
00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:57.620
- Commander?
- Cadet Kirk, you somehow managed

378
00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:00.080
to install and activate a subroutine
in the programming code,

379
00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.040
thereby changing
the conditions of the test.

380
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:07.380
- Your point being?
- In academic vernacular, you cheated.

381
00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:12.960
Let me ask you something
I think we all know the answer to.

382
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:16.010
The test itself is a cheat, isn't it?

383
00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:18.010
I mean, you programmed it
to be unwinnable.

384
00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:20.680
Your argument precludes the possibility
of a no-win scenario.

385
00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:24.350
- I don't believe in no-win scenarios.
- Then not only did you violate the rules,

386
00:34:24.430 --> 00:34:26.390
you also failed to understand
the principal lesson.

387
00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.020
Please, enlighten me.

388
00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:30.310
You of all people should know,
Cadet Kirk,

389
00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.570
a captain cannot cheat death.

390
00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:36.990
I of all people?

391
00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:40.410
Your father, Lieutenant George Kirk,
assumed command of his vessel

392
00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:42.160
before being killed in action, did he not?

393
00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:44.040
I don't think you like the fact
that I beat your test.

394
00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.290
Furthermore, you have failed to divine
the purpose of the test.

395
00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:49.880
- Enlighten me again.
- The purpose is to experience fear,

396
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:52.750
fear in the face of certain death.

397
00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:57.010
To accept that fear, and maintain
control of oneself and one's crew.

398
00:34:57.090 --> 00:35:00.510
This is a quality expected
in every Starfleet captain.

399
00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:04.520
Excuse me, sir.

400
00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:13.650
We've received a distress call
from Vulcan.

401
00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:16.820
With our primary fleet engaged
in the Laurentian system,

402
00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:21.320
I hereby order all cadets to report
to Hangar One immediately. Dismissed.

403
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:31.880
- Who was that pointy-eared bastard?
- I don't know, but I like him.

404
00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:39.380
Fugeman, Regula One!
Gerace, U. S. S. Farragut!

405
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:42.720
McCoy, U. S. S. Enterprise!
McGrath, U. S. S. Wolcott!

406
00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.350
Rader, U. S. S. Hood.
Welcome to Starfleet, and Godspeed.

407
00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.690
He didn't call my name.

408
00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:56.070
Commander? Sir, you didn't call
my name. Kirk, James T.

409
00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.740
Kirk, you're on academic suspension.

410
00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:00.700
That means you're grounded
until the Academy Board rules.

411
00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:03.570
All right, listen up! I'm gonna read
this list one time, and one time only!

412
00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:08.500
Jim, the Board will rule in your favour.
Most likely.

413
00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:13.750
- Look, Jim, I gotta go.
- Yeah.

414
00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.960
Yeah, you go. Be safe.

415
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:25.760
- Excuse me.
- Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

416
00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:31.850
Damn it.

417
00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:37.940
- Come with me.
- U. S. S. Newton! Uhura, U. S. S. Farragut!

418
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:41.780
Petrovsky, U. S. S. Antares!
Go to your stations and good luck.

419
00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.950
- Bones, where are we going?
- You'll see.

420
00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.790
- Commander, a word?
- Yes, Lieutenant?

421
00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:54.250
- Was I not one of your top students?
- Indeed you were.

422
00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:56.460
And did I not
on multiple occasions demonstrate

423
00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:59.710
an exceptional aural sensitivity
and, I quote,

424
00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.090
"an unparalleled ability
to identify sonic anomalies"

425
00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:05.550
- in subspace transmissions tests?
- Consistently, yes.

426
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.640
And while you were well aware
that my unqualified desire

427
00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:10.770
is to serve on the U. S. S. Enterprise,
I'm assigned to the Farragut?

428
00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:14.020
It was an attempt to avoid
the appearance of favouritism.

429
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.610
No. I'm assigned to the Enterprise.

430
00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:22.900
- Yes, I believe you are.
- Thank you.

431
00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:26.070
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing you a favour.

432
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.830
I couldn't just leave you there,
looking all pathetic.

433
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:31.160
Take a seat. I'm gonna give you
a vaccine against viral infection

434
00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:35.120
- from Melvaran mud fleas.
- What for?

435
00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:37.420
- To give you the symptoms.
- What are you talking about?

436
00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.750
You're gonna start to lose vision
in your left eye.

437
00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.010
Yeah, I already have.

438
00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:43.840
Oh, and you're gonna get
a really bad headache and a flop sweat.

439
00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:46.050
- You call this a favour?
- Yeah. You owe me one.

440
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:53.020
Kirk, James T. He is not cleared
for duty aboard the Enterprise.

441
00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:54.640
Medical code states the treatment

442
00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:56.730
and transport of a patient is
to be determined

443
00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:59.900
at the discretion of his
attending physician, which is me.

444
00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:01.860
So I'm taking Mr Kirk aboard.

445
00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.360
Or would you like to explain
to Captain Pike

446
00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:06.280
why the Enterprise warped into a crisis

447
00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:09.200
without one of its senior
medical officers?

448
00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.790
- As you were.
- As you were. Come on.

449
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:34.390
- I might throw up on you.
- Jim, you've got to look at this.

450
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:36.730
- Jim, look.
- What?

451
00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:37.850
Look.

452
00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:38.460
- We need to get you changed.
- I don't feel right. I feel like I'm leaking.

453
00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:41.250
Hell, it's that pointy-eared bastard.

454
00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:00.940
- Mr Spock.
- Captain.

455
00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:04.060
- Engineering reports ready for launch.
- Thank you.

456
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:06.440
Ladies and gentlemen, the maiden
voyage of our newest flagship

457
00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:09.950
deserves more pomp and circumstance
than we can afford today.

458
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:13.950
Her christening will just have to be
our reward for a safe return. Carry on.

459
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:17.240
All decks, this is Captain Pike.
Prepare for immediate departure.

460
00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:18.620
Helm, thrusters.

461
00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:21.080
Moorings retracted, Captain.
Dock Control reports ready.

462
00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:23.330
Thrusters fired.
Separating from spacedock.

463
00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:36.430
The fleet's cleared spacedock, Captain.
All ships ready for warp.

464
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:40.600
- Set a course for Vulcan.
- Aye-aye, Captain. Course laid in.

465
00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:44.310
Maximum warp. Punch it.

466
00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:03.120
Lieutenant,
where is Helmsman McKenna?

467
00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:06.290
He has lungworms, sir.
He couldn't report to his post.

468
00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:07.840
I'm Hikaru Sulu.

469
00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:11.300
- And you are a pilot, right?
- Very much so, sir.

470
00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:14.760
I'm not sure what's wrong here.

471
00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:18.810
- Is the parking brake on?
- No. I'll figure it out. I'm just...

472
00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:22.180
Have you disengaged
the external inertial dampener?

473
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:28.270
- Ready for warp, sir.
- Let's punch it.

474
00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:37.370
- Where are we?
- Medical Bay.

475
00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:39.280
- This isn't worth it.
- A little suffering's good for the soul.

476
00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:41.080
- Hi! How are you?
- Come here.

477
00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:44.710
- My mouth is itchy. Is that normal?
- Well, those symptoms won't last long.

478
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:47.920
- I'm going to give you a mild sedative.
- I wish I didn't know you.

479
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.840
Don't be such an infant.

480
00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:52.800
How long is it supposed to...

481
00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:54.840
Unbelievable.

482
00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:58.640
- Engines at maximum warp, Captain.
- Russian whiz kid, what's your name?

483
00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:02.560
- Chanko? Cherpov?
- Ensign Chekov, Pavel Andreievich, sir.

484
00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:06.190
Fine, Chekov, Pavel Andreievich.
Begin ship-wide mission broadcast.

485
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:07.980
Yes, sir. Happy to.

486
00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:12.530
Ensign authorisation code
nine-five-Wictor-Wictor-two.

487
00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:14.570
Authorisation not recognised.

488
00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:16.860
Ensign authorisation code

489
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:21.290
nine-five-Victor-Victor-two.

490
00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:26.120
May I have your attention, please?

491
00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:32.130
At 2200 hours, telemetry detected
an anomaly in the Neutral Zone.

492
00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:35.720
What appeared to be
a lightning storm in space.

493
00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:40.800
Soon after, Starfleet received a distress
signal from the Vulcan High Command

494
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:44.480
that their planet
was experiencing seismic activity.

495
00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:48.770
Our mission is to assess
the condition of Vulcan

496
00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:52.150
and assist in evacuations if necessary.

497
00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:57.490
We should be arriving at Vulcan within
three minutes. Thank you for your time.

498
00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:03.830
- Lightning storm.
- Jim, you're awake. How do you feel?

499
00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.500
- Good God, man.
- What?

500
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:12.630
- What the hell's this?
- A reaction to the vaccine, damn it!

501
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:14.920
Nurse Chapel,
I need 50 cc's of cortisone!

502
00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:16.720
Yes, sir!

503
00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:21.800
...appeared to be

504
00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:21.800
a lightning storm in space.

505
00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:24.180
- Hey!
- We gotta stop the ship.

506
00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:28.390
Jim! I'm not kidding!
We need to keep your heart rate down!

507
00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:30.100
Computer, locate crew member Uhura.

508
00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:32.310
You know, I haven't seen a reaction
this severe since med school.

509
00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:35.570
- We're flying into a trap!
- Damn it, Jim, stand still!

510
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:38.450
Stop it!

511
00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.080
- Uhura! Uhura...
- Kirk! What are you doing here?

512
00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:51.130
The transmission from the Klingon
prison planet. What exactly...

513
00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:53.170
Oh, my God,
what's wrong with your hands?

514
00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:55.170
It's... Look, who is responsible
for the Klingon attack?

515
00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:56.800
- What?
- And was the ship...

516
00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:57.970
Was the ship what?

517
00:43:58.050 --> 00:44:00.470
- What's happening to my mouth?
- You got numb tongue?

518
00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:02.510
- Numb tongue?
- I can fix that.

519
00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:04.560
- Was the ship what?
- Romulan.

520
00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:06.470
- What? I...
- Romulan.

521
00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:07.680
- Romulan?
- Yeah!

522
00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:09.020
- Yes.
- Yes?

523
00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:10.230
Damn it!

524
00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:47.350
Prod Nero. Seven Federation ships
are on their way.

525
00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:50.640
- Jim!
- What's going on?

526
00:44:50.770 --> 00:44:51.770
- Jim, come back!
- Kirk!

527
00:44:51.850 --> 00:44:53.690
- Captain! Captain Pike, sir...
- Jim, come back here!

528
00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:55.230
- ...we have to stop the ship!
- Kirk, how the hell

529
00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:56.860
did you get onboard the Enterprise?

530
00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:58.690
Captain, this man's under the influence

531
00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:00.280
- of a severe reaction to a vaccine.
- Bones, please...

532
00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.070
He's completely delusional,
and I take full responsibility.

533
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:03.610
Vulcan is not experiencing
a natural disaster.

534
00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:05.070
It's being attacked by Romulans.

535
00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:08.490
Romulans? Cadet Kirk, I think you've
had enough attention for one day.

536
00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:09.910
McCoy, take him back to medical.

537
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.580
- We'll have words later.
- Aye, Captain.

538
00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:13.120
Look, sir, that same anomaly
that we saw today...

539
00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:14.960
Mr Kirk is not cleared
to be aboard this vessel, Captain.

540
00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:16.340
- I get it. You're a great arguer.
- By Regulations...

541
00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:18.130
- I'd love to do it again.
- ...that makes him a stowaway.

542
00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:19.500
- I can remove the cadet...
- Try it!

543
00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:21.090
- Kirk...
- This cadet is trying to save the Bridge.

544
00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:24.180
By recommending a full stop mid-warp
during a rescue mission?

545
00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:25.930
It's not a rescue mission.
Listen to me, it's an attack.

546
00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:27.800
Based on what facts?

547
00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:32.600
That same anomaly, a lightning storm
in space that we saw today,

548
00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:34.650
also occurred on the day of my birth,

549
00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:37.610
before a Romulan ship
attacked the U. S. S. Kelvin.

550
00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:39.730
You know that, sir,
I read your dissertation.

551
00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:42.440
That ship, which had formidable
and advanced weaponry,

552
00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:44.240
was never seen or heard from again.

553
00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.280
The Kelvin attack took place
on the edge of Klingon space,

554
00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:49.160
and at 2300 hours last night,
there was an attack.

555
00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:52.700
Forty-seven Klingon warbirds
destroyed by Romulans, sir,

556
00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:56.120
and it was reported that the Romulans
were in one ship, one massive ship.

557
00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:59.000
And you know
of this Klingon attack how?

558
00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:04.720
Sir, I intercepted and translated
the message myself.

559
00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:07.470
- Kirk's report is accurate.
- We're warping into a trap, sir.

560
00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:10.680
The Romulans are waiting for us,
I promise you that.

561
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:13.560
The cadet's logic is sound.

562
00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:16.140
And Lieutenant Uhura is unmatched
in xenolinguistics.

563
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:18.110
We would be wise
to accept her conclusion.

564
00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:21.150
Scan Vulcan space. Check
for any transmissions in Romulan.

565
00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:24.570
Sir, I'm not sure I can distinguish
the Romulan language from Vulcan.

566
00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:26.660
What about you?
Do you speak Romulan, Cadet...

567
00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:28.320
Uhura. All three dialects, sir.

568
00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:31.540
- Uhura, relieve the lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

569
00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:33.290
Hannity, hail the U. S. S. Truman.

570
00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:35.830
All the other ships are out of warp, sir,
and have arrived at Vulcan,

571
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:38.170
but we seem to have lost all contact.

572
00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:40.960
Sir, I pick up no Romulan transmission,

573
00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:45.550
- or transmission of any kind in the area.
- It's because they're being attacked.

574
00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:51.220
Shields up. Red alert.

575
00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:55.230
Arrival at Vulcan in five seconds.

576
00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:58.730
Four, three, two...

577
00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.900
- Emergency evasive!
- On it, sir.

578
00:47:10.570 --> 00:47:12.200
- Damage report!
- Deflector shields are holding.

579
00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.410
All stations! Engineer Olson, report!

580
00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:26.260
Full reverse.
Come about starboard 90 degrees.

581
00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:27.840
Drop us down underneath them, Sulu.

582
00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:49.110
Sir, there's another Federation ship!

583
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:51.280
- Destroy it, too.
- Fire torpedoes.

584
00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:52.570
Captain, they're locking torpedoes.

585
00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:55.120
Divert auxiliary power from port nacelles
to forward shields.

586
00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.500
- Sulu, status report.
- Shields at 32%.

587
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:08.010
Their weapons are powerful, sir.
We can't take another hit like that.

588
00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:09.170
Get me Starfleet Command.

589
00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:12.430
Captain, the Romulan ship has lowered
some kind of high-energy pulse device

590
00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:13.760
into the Vulcan atmosphere.

591
00:48:13.850 --> 00:48:15.390
Its signal appears to be blocking
our communications

592
00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:17.600
- and transporter abilities.
- All power to forward shields.

593
00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:19.060
Prepare to fire all weapons.

594
00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:26.230
- Weapons ready.
- Wait!

595
00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:29.320
- The hull. Magnify.
- Yes, sir.

596
00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:36.330
Captain, we're being hailed.

597
00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:38.580
Hello.

598
00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:43.380
I'm Captain Christopher Pike.
To whom am I speaking?

599
00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.540
Hi, Christopher. I'm Nero.

600
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:47.460
You've declared war
against the Federation.

601
00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:50.630
Withdraw, I'll agree to arrange
a conference with Romulan leadership

602
00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:54.050
- at a neutral location.
- I do not speak for the Empire.

603
00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:55.680
We stand apart.

604
00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:00.930
As does your Vulcan crew member.
Isn't that right, Spock?

605
00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:06.400
Pardon me, I do not believe
that you and I are acquainted.

606
00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:09.190
No, we're not. Not yet.

607
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:13.450
Spock, there's something
I would like you to see.

608
00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:18.540
Captain Pike,
your transporter has been disabled.

609
00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:23.040
As you can see by the rest
of your armada, you have no choice.

610
00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:27.590
You will man a shuttle and come aboard
the Narada for negotiations.

611
00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:29.630
That is all.

612
00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.560
- He'll kill you. You know that.
- Your survival is unlikely.

613
00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:43.640
Captain, we gain nothing by diplomacy.
Going over to that ship is a mistake.

614
00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:45.480
I, too, agree.
You should rethink your strategy.

615
00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:47.230
I understand that.

616
00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:51.280
I need officers who've been trained
in advanced hand-to-hand combat.

617
00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:54.610
- I have training, sir.
- Come with me.

618
00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:57.820
Kirk, you, too.
You're not supposed to be here anyway.

619
00:49:57.910 --> 00:50:00.620
- Chekov, you have the conn.
- Aye-aye, Captain.

620
00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:23.680
Prepare the red matter.

621
00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:26.440
Yes, sir.

622
00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:07.190
Without transporters,
we can't beam off the ship,

623
00:51:07.310 --> 00:51:09.310
we can't assist Vulcan,
we can't do our job.

624
00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:14.320
Mr Kirk, Mr Sulu, Engineer Olson
will space-jump from the shuttle.

625
00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:17.450
You will land on that machine
they've lowered into the atmosphere

626
00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:20.660
that's scrambling our gear.
You'll get inside, you'll disable it,

627
00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:22.080
then you'll beam back to the ship.

628
00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:25.660
Mr Spock, I'm leaving you
in command of the Enterprise.

629
00:51:25.830 --> 00:51:28.290
Once we have transport capability
and communications back up,

630
00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:31.290
you'll contact Starfleet and report
what the hell's going on here.

631
00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:33.170
And if all else fails, fall back

632
00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:35.340
and rendezvous with the fleet
in the Laurentian system.

633
00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:36.840
Kirk, I'm promoting you to first officer.

634
00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:38.300
- What?
- Captain?

635
00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:41.430
Please, I apologise, the complexities
of human pranks escape me.

636
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:46.100
It's not a prank, Spock.
And I'm not the Captain, you are.

637
00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:48.520
Let's go.

638
00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:53.820
Sir, after we knock out that drill,
what happens to you?

639
00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:56.280
Well, I guess you'll have to come
and get me.

640
00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:58.860
Careful with the ship, Spock,
she's brand new.

641
00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:11.830
Dr Puri, report.

642
00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.790
It's McCoy.
Dr Puri was on Deck 6. He's dead.

643
00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:19.970
Then you have just inherited his
responsibility as chief medical officer.

644
00:52:20.050 --> 00:52:21.640
Yeah, tell me something I don't know.

645
00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:24.720
Shuttle 37, you're clear forward!

646
00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:28.520
Shuttle 89, U.S.S. Enterprise,
you are clear forward.

647
00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:31.060
Interval check shows
positive and steady.

648
00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:33.730
- You got the charges, right?
- Oh, yeah.

649
00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:36.650
I can't wait to kick some Romulan ass.
Right?

650
00:52:36.730 --> 00:52:38.610
- Yeah.
- Hell, yeah.

651
00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:46.080
Shuttle command, we advise
you activate your shields now.

652
00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:00.260
So what kind of combat training
do you have?

653
00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:01.760
Fencing.

654
00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:06.260
Pre-jump.

655
00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:14.100
Shuttle commander, you are clear
from U.S.S. Enterprise airspace.

656
00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:22.490
Gentlemen, we're approaching
the drop zone.

657
00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:25.620
We have one shot
to land on that platform.

658
00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:28.910
They may have defences,
so pull your chute as late as possible.

659
00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:31.960
Three, two, one.

660
00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:35.880
Remember, the Enterprise
won't be able to beam you back

661
00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:37.460
until you turn off that drill.

662
00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:40.510
Good luck.

663
00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:05.030
Away team is entering
the atmosphere, sir.

664
00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:06.530
Twenty thousand metres.

665
00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:33.390
Approaching the platform
at 5,800 metres.

666
00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:37.520
Kirk to Enterprise.
Distance to target, 5,000 metres.

667
00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:42.190
Forty-six hundred metres
from the platform.

668
00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:43.690
Forty-five hundred metres to target.

669
00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:47.160
Four thousand metres.

670
00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:49.410
- Three thousand metres.
- Three thousand metres.

671
00:54:49.530 --> 00:54:51.620
- Two thousand metres.
- Pulling chute.

672
00:54:57.420 --> 00:55:00.750
- Two thousand metres!
- Come on, pull your chute, Olson!

673
00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:03.960
No, not yet! Not yet! 1,500 metres!

674
00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:07.630
- Olson, open your chute!
- Olson, pull your chute!

675
00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:09.430
One thousand metres!

676
00:55:14.810 --> 00:55:15.890
No!

677
00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:23.110
Olson!

678
00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:25.740
Olson is gone, sir!

679
00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.630
Kirk has landed, sir.

680
00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:54.050
Give me your hand! Come on.

681
00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:02.100
Olson had the charges.

682
00:58:02.930 --> 00:58:04.230
I know.

683
00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:08.650
- What do we do?
- This.

684
00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:24.750
The jamming signal's gone.
Transport abilities are reestablished.

685
00:58:24.830 --> 00:58:28.250
- Transporter control is reengaged, sir.
- Chekov, run gravitational sensors.

686
00:58:28.330 --> 00:58:29.790
I want to know
what they are doing to the planet.

687
00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:32.090
Aye, Commander.
Captain. Sorry. Captain.

688
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:40.760
The drill's been sabotaged, sir,
but we have reached the planet's core.

689
00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:42.100
Launch the red matter.

690
00:58:57.110 --> 00:59:00.240
Kirk to Enterprise. They just launched
something at the planet

691
00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:01.660
through the hole they just drilled.

692
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:04.120
- Do you copy, Enterprise?
- Yes, sir.

693
00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:05.750
- Analysing data now.
- Transporter is now operational.

694
00:59:05.830 --> 00:59:08.620
Captain, gravitational sensors
are off the scale.

695
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:10.790
If my calculations are correct,

696
00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:15.970
they're creating a singularity
that will consume the planet.

697
00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:21.760
They're creating a black hole
at the centre of Vulcan?

698
00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:24.520
- Yes, sir.
- How long does the planet have?

699
00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:28.480
Minutes, sir. Minutes.

700
00:59:29.850 --> 00:59:32.070
Alert Vulcan Command Centre
to signal a planet-wide evacuation,

701
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:33.520
- all channels, all frequencies.
- Spock, wait!

702
00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:35.400
- Maintain standard orbit.
- Yes, sir.

703
00:59:35.490 --> 00:59:37.570
- Where are you going?
- To evacuate the Vulcan High Council.

704
00:59:37.650 --> 00:59:39.660
They are tasked
with protecting our cultural history.

705
00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:41.870
- My parents will be among them.
- Can't you beam them out?

706
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:44.410
It is impossible.
They will be in the katric ark.

707
00:59:44.490 --> 00:59:46.200
I must get them myself.

708
00:59:46.330 --> 00:59:48.500
- Chekov, you have the conn.
- Aye.

709
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:55.840
- Kirk to Enterprise! Beam us out of here!
- Stand by. Locking on your signal.

710
00:59:56.840 --> 01:00:00.090
- Retract the drill. Let's move out.
- Yes, sir. Pull it up!

711
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:06.180
I can't lock on to you.
Don't move. Don't move!

712
01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:08.020
- Kirk!
- Sulu!

713
01:00:15.690 --> 01:00:16.780
Sulu!

714
01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:21.360
Hold on!

715
01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:25.540
I got you! Now pull my chute!

716
01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:37.710
Kirk to Enterprise! We're falling
without a chute! Beam us up!

717
01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.670
- I'm trying. I can't lock on to your signal.
- Beam us up!

718
01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.430
- You're moving too fast.
- Beam us up!

719
01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:43.800
I can do that. I can do that!

720
01:00:44.550 --> 01:00:46.310
- Take the conn!
- Aye, sir.

721
01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:47.470
The black hole's expanding.

722
01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:49.890
We won't reach minimum safe distance
if we don't leave immediately.

723
01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:53.230
Move, move, move, move, move!

724
01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:55.230
I can do that! I can do that!
Move, move, move, move!

725
01:00:55.770 --> 01:00:57.940
Quick, give me manual control!
I can lock on!

726
01:00:58.070 --> 01:00:59.400
Beam us up!

727
01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:02.950
Enterprise, where are you?

728
01:01:03.070 --> 01:01:04.740
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

729
01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:08.160
Now, now, now! Do it now!
Now, now, now, now!

730
01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:13.750
Okay, okay, okay! Hold on! Hold on!
Compensating gravitational pull, and...

731
01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:20.260
Gotcha!

732
01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:32.600
- Thanks.
- No problem.

733
01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:37.480
Clear the pad.
I'm beaming to the surface.

734
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:39.980
The surface of what?

735
01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:42.610
What, are you going down there?
Are you nuts?

736
01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:44.780
Spock, you can't do that!

737
01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:46.450
- Energise.
- Spock!

738
01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:26.990
- Spock!
- The planet has only seconds left.

739
01:02:27.070 --> 01:02:28.320
We must evacuate.

740
01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.580
Mother, now!

741
01:02:52.850 --> 01:02:55.310
- Spock to Enterprise. Get us out now.
- Locking volume.

742
01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:57.520
Don't move. Stay right where you are.

743
01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:08.030
Transport in five, four, three, two...

744
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:12.620
- Mother!
- I'm losing her!

745
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:14.700
I'm losing her! I'm losing her!

746
01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:16.910
No! I lost her. I lost her.

747
01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:17.480
Acting Captain's Log, Stardate 2258.42.

748
01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:20.810
We have had no word
from Captain Pike.

749
01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:23.730
I have therefore classified him

750
01:04:23.810 --> 01:04:26.690
a hostage of the war criminal
known as Nero.

751
01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:29.030
Nero, who has destroyed
my home planet

752
01:04:29.110 --> 01:04:31.780
and most of its six billion inhabitants.

753
01:04:33.450 --> 01:04:35.790
While the essence of our culture
has been saved

754
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:38.950
in the elders
who now reside upon this ship,

755
01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:43.290
I estimate no more than 10,000
have survived.

756
01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:49.970
I am now a member
of an endangered species.

757
01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:18.870
I'm sorry.

758
01:05:21.330 --> 01:05:22.670
I'm sorry.

759
01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:26.000
I'm so sorry.

760
01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:42.060
What do you need? Tell me.

761
01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:44.270
Tell me.

762
01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:57.870
I need everyone
to continue performing admirably.

763
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:06.880
Okay.

764
01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:28.440
You must have
a lot of questions for me.

765
01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:31.070
I only have one for you.

766
01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:37.070
I need the subspace frequencies
of Starfleet's border protection grids,

767
01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:39.740
specifically those surrounding Earth.

768
01:06:41.450 --> 01:06:44.750
Christopher, answer my question.

769
01:06:44.830 --> 01:06:46.920
No, you answer for the genocide
you just committed

770
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.790
- against a peaceful planet.
- No, I prevented genocide.

771
01:06:53.590 --> 01:06:58.680
In my time, where I come from,
this is a simple mining vessel.

772
01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:01.680
I chose a life of honest labour

773
01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:05.980
to provide for myself and the wife
who was expecting my child.

774
01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:10.770
I was off planet, doing my job
while your Federation did nothing

775
01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:14.280
and allowed my people to burn
while their planet broke in half.

776
01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:17.240
And Spock, he didn't help us.
He betrayed us!

777
01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:19.200
No, you're confused.

778
01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:21.450
You've been misinformed.
Romulus hasn't been destroyed.

779
01:07:21.530 --> 01:07:22.990
It's out there right now.

780
01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:25.120
You're blaming the Federation
for something that hasn't happened.

781
01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.080
It has happened! I watched it happen!

782
01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:30.290
I saw it happen!
Don't tell me it didn't happen!

783
01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:38.630
And when I lost her,
I promised myself retribution.

784
01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:43.680
And for 25 years I planned my revenge
against the Federation,

785
01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:46.560
and forgot what it was like
to live a normal life.

786
01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.730
But I did not forget the pain.

787
01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:54.650
It's a pain that every surviving Vulcan
now shares.

788
01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:58.570
My purpose, Christopher,

789
01:07:58.650 --> 01:08:02.320
is to not simply avoid
the destruction of the home that I love,

790
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:08.500
but to create a Romulus
that exists free of the Federation.

791
01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:14.170
You see, only then
will she be truly saved.

792
01:08:15.590 --> 01:08:20.010
That is why I will destroy
all the remaining Federation planets,

793
01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:22.010
starting with yours.

794
01:08:22.850 --> 01:08:25.470
Then we have nothing left to discuss.

795
01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:32.730
You will give me the frequencies
to disable Earth's defences.

796
01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:37.190
Centaurian slugs.

797
01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:40.610
They latch on to your brain stem

798
01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:44.950
and release a toxin
that will force you to answer.

799
01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:47.830
Frequencies, please, sir.

800
01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:50.750
Christopher Pike,
Captain, U. S. S. Enterprise...

801
01:08:50.830 --> 01:08:52.250
As you wish.

802
01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:01.760
Have you confirmed
that Nero is headed for Earth?

803
01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:04.970
Their trajectory suggests
no other destination, Captain.

804
01:09:05.050 --> 01:09:07.720
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
- Earth may be his next stop,

805
01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:10.680
but we have to assume
every Federation planet's a target.

806
01:09:10.770 --> 01:09:12.230
Out of the chair.

807
01:09:12.310 --> 01:09:16.570
Well, if the Federation is a target,
why didn't they destroy us?

808
01:09:16.650 --> 01:09:19.320
Why would they? Why waste a weapon?
We obviously weren't a threat.

809
01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:21.030
That is not it.

810
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:22.570
He said he wanted me
to see something,

811
01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:24.070
the destruction of my home planet.

812
01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.240
How the hell did they do that,
by the way?

813
01:09:26.330 --> 01:09:28.290
I mean, where did the Romulans
get that kind of weaponry?

814
01:09:28.370 --> 01:09:30.200
The engineering comprehension
necessary

815
01:09:30.290 --> 01:09:33.750
to artificially create a black hole
may suggest an answer.

816
01:09:33.830 --> 01:09:36.170
Such technology
could theoretically be manipulated

817
01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:38.420
to create a tunnel through space-time.

818
01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:40.550
Damn it, man,
I'm a doctor, not a physicist.

819
01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:42.260
Are you actually suggesting
they're from the future?

820
01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:45.390
If you eliminate the impossible,
whatever remains, however improbable,

821
01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:47.600
- must be the truth.
- How poetic.

822
01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:51.430
Then what would an angry
future Romulan want with Captain Pike?

823
01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.060
As Captain, he does know details
of Starfleet's defences.

824
01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:55.810
What we need to do
is catch up to that ship,

825
01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:57.900
disable it, take it over and get Pike back.

826
01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:00.110
We are technologically outmatched
in every way.

827
01:10:00.190 --> 01:10:02.320
A rescue attempt would be illogical.

828
01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:05.200
Nero's ship would have to drop
out of warp for us to overtake them.

829
01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.410
Then what about
assigning engineering crews

830
01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:09.870
- to try and boost our warp yield?
- Remaining crew are repairing

831
01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:11.830
- radiation leaks on the lower decks...
- Okay! All right!

832
01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:13.660
...and damage to subspace
communications, without which

833
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:15.500
- we cannot contact Starfleet.
- There's got to be some way...

834
01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:17.960
We must gather
with the rest of Starfleet

835
01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:19.800
to balance the terms
of the next engagement.

836
01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:21.420
There won't be a next engagement.

837
01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:24.430
By the time we've gathered,
it'll be too late.

838
01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:26.930
But you say he's from the future,
knows what's gonna happen?

839
01:10:27.010 --> 01:10:29.140
Then the logical thing
is to be unpredictable.

840
01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:32.810
You're assuming that Nero knows
how events are predicted to unfold.

841
01:10:32.890 --> 01:10:35.640
The contrary, Nero's very presence
has altered the flow of history,

842
01:10:35.770 --> 01:10:37.350
beginning with the attack
on the U. S. S. Kelvin,

843
01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:38.480
culminating in the events of today,

844
01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:41.020
thereby creating
an entire new chain of incidents

845
01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:43.860
that cannot be anticipated
by either party.

846
01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:45.490
An alternate reality.

847
01:10:46.410 --> 01:10:47.660
Precisely.

848
01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:52.290
Whatever our lives might have been,
if the time continuum was disrupted,

849
01:10:52.830 --> 01:10:54.960
our destinies have changed.

850
01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:57.500
Mr Sulu, plot a course for the
Laurentian system, warp factor 3.

851
01:10:57.580 --> 01:10:58.880
Spock, don't do that.

852
01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:02.760
Running back to the rest of the fleet
for a confab is a massive waste of time.

853
01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:05.010
These are the orders issued
by Captain Pike when he left the ship.

854
01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:06.930
He also ordered us
to go back and get him.

855
01:11:07.010 --> 01:11:08.510
Spock, you are Captain now.
You have to make...

856
01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:10.010
I am aware of my responsibilities,
Mr Kirk.

857
01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:12.510
Every second we waste, Nero's
getting closer to his next target.

858
01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:14.560
That is correct, and why
I'm instructing you to accept the fact

859
01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:17.190
- that I alone am in command.
- I will not allow us to go backwards...

860
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:18.900
- Jim, he's the Captain!
- ...away from the problem,

861
01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:22.520
- instead of hunting Nero down!
- Security, escort him out.

862
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:32.200
- Hey!
- Enough, Jim!

863
01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:39.830
Get him off this ship.

864
01:12:00.230 --> 01:12:03.020
- Computer, where am I?
- Location, Delta Vega.

865
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:05.230
Class-M planet. Unsafe.

866
01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:08.610
There is a Starfleet outpost
14 kilometres to the northwest.

867
01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:09.910
Remain in your pod

868
01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:12.620
- until retrieved by Starfleet authorities.
- You gotta be kidding me.

869
01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:58.450
Stardate 2258.42.

870
01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:03.040
Or 44. Whatever.

871
01:13:03.130 --> 01:13:06.800
Acting Captain Spock
has marooned me on Delta Vega,

872
01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:11.470
in what I believe to be
a violation of Security Protocol 49.09

873
01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:13.800
governing the treatment of prisoners
aboard a star...

874
01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:26.100
James T. Kirk.

875
01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:30.940
- Excuse me?
- How did you find me?

876
01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:34.940
How do you know my name?

877
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:39.660
I have been and always shall be
your friend.

878
01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:48.040
- Look, I don't know you.
- I am Spock.

879
01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:54.000
Bullshit.

880
01:15:54.630 --> 01:15:57.880
It is remarkably pleasing
to see you again, old friend.

881
01:15:57.970 --> 01:16:00.550
Especially after the events of today.

882
01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:04.510
Sir, I appreciate
what you did for me today,

883
01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:08.480
but if you were Spock,
you'd know we're not friends. At all.

884
01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:11.060
You hate me.
You marooned me here for mutiny.

885
01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:13.070
- Mutiny?
- Yes.

886
01:16:13.150 --> 01:16:15.150
You are not the captain?

887
01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:23.530
No, no, you're the captain.
Pike was taken hostage.

888
01:16:24.990 --> 01:16:26.200
By Nero.

889
01:16:32.170 --> 01:16:34.290
What do you know about him?

890
01:16:34.670 --> 01:16:37.300
He is a particularly troubled Romulan.

891
01:16:38.590 --> 01:16:44.050
- Please, allow me. It will be easier.
- What are you doing?

892
01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:46.770
Our minds, one and together.

893
01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:51.980
One hundred twenty-nine years
from now,

894
01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:56.110
a star will explode
and threaten to destroy the galaxy.

895
01:16:57.230 --> 01:17:00.860
That is where I'm from, Jim, the future.

896
01:17:05.330 --> 01:17:11.460
A star went supernova,
consuming everything in its path.

897
01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:15.630
I promised the Romulans
that I would save their planet.

898
01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:23.180
We outfitted our fastest ship.

899
01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:27.060
Using red matter,
I would create a black hole

900
01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:29.100
which would absorb the exploding star.

901
01:17:30.890 --> 01:17:33.730
I was en route,
when the unthinkable happened.

902
01:17:35.190 --> 01:17:38.280
The supernova destroyed Romulus.

903
01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:45.740
I had little time.

904
01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:52.290
I had to extract the red matter
and shoot it into the supernova.

905
01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:11.560
As I began my return trip,
I was intercepted.

906
01:18:11.890 --> 01:18:15.810
He called himself Nero,
last of the Romulan Empire.

907
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:20.480
In my attempt to escape, both of us
were pulled into the black hole.

908
01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:31.870
Nero went through first.
He was the first to arrive.

909
01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:42.550
Nero and his crew spent
the next 25 years awaiting my arrival.

910
01:18:42.630 --> 01:18:44.720
But what was years for Nero

911
01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:48.220
was only seconds for me.

912
01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:51.390
I went through the black hole.

913
01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.940
Nero was waiting for me.

914
01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:04.950
He held me responsible
for the loss of his world.

915
01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:09.490
He captured my vessel
and spared my life,

916
01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:12.290
for one reason.

917
01:19:13.330 --> 01:19:15.660
So that I would know his pain.

918
01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:21.590
He beamed me here
so that I could observe his vengeance.

919
01:19:23.170 --> 01:19:25.920
As he was helpless to save his planet,

920
01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:29.300
I would be helpless to save mine.

921
01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:36.480
Billions of lives lost because of me, Jim.

922
01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:39.440
Because I failed.

923
01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:45.990
Forgive me. Emotional transference
is an effect of the mind-meld.

924
01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:56.160
- So you do feel.
- Yes.

925
01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.040
Going back in time,
you changed all our lives.

926
01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:03.210
Jim, we must go.

927
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.010
There is a Starfleet outpost
not far from here.

928
01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:11.850
Wait. Where you came from,

929
01:20:14.430 --> 01:20:16.220
did I know my father?

930
01:20:17.390 --> 01:20:18.440
Yes.

931
01:20:19.230 --> 01:20:23.400
You often spoke of him as being
your inspiration for joining Starfleet.

932
01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:27.240
He proudly lived to see you
become Captain of the Enterprise.

933
01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:29.150
Captain?

934
01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:32.410
A ship we must return you to
as soon as possible.

935
01:20:40.710 --> 01:20:43.080
- Warp 3, sir.
- Course 1-5-1, mark 3.

936
01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:45.800
- Laurentian system, sir.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

937
01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:49.300
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes, Doctor.

938
01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:53.010
I am aware that James Kirk is
a friend of yours.

939
01:20:53.090 --> 01:20:55.970
I recognise that supporting me
as you did must have been difficult.

940
01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:57.680
Is that a thank-you?

941
01:20:57.770 --> 01:21:00.480
I am simply acknowledging
your difficulties.

942
01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:02.400
Permission to speak freely, sir.

943
01:21:03.810 --> 01:21:07.280
- I welcome it.
- Do you? Okay, then.

944
01:21:07.610 --> 01:21:10.030
Are you out of your Vulcan mind?

945
01:21:10.110 --> 01:21:12.570
Are you making a logical choice,
sending Kirk away?

946
01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:14.450
Probably. But the right one?

947
01:21:14.530 --> 01:21:15.990
You know, back home we got a saying,

948
01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:17.490
"If you're gonna ride
in the Kentucky Derby,

949
01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:19.870
"you don't leave your prize stallion
in the stable."

950
01:21:19.950 --> 01:21:21.250
A curious metaphor, Doctor,

951
01:21:21.330 --> 01:21:25.710
as a stallion must first be broken
before it can reach its potential.

952
01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:28.090
My God, man, you could at least act
like it was a hard decision!

953
01:21:28.170 --> 01:21:29.460
I intend to assist in the effort

954
01:21:29.550 --> 01:21:32.130
to reestablish communication
with Starfleet.

955
01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:36.100
However, if crew morale is better served
by my roaming the halls weeping,

956
01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:39.180
I will gladly defer
to your medical expertise.

957
01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:41.730
Excuse me.

958
01:21:46.150 --> 01:21:47.650
Green-blooded hobgoblin.

959
01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:26.400
Hello!

960
01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:10.230
What?

961
01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:16.150
You realise how unacceptable this is?

962
01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:17.660
- Fascinating.
- What?

963
01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:19.200
Okay, I'm sure you're just
doing your job,

964
01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:21.080
but could you not have come
a wee bit sooner?

965
01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:22.410
Six months I've been here,

966
01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:25.620
living off Starfleet protein nibs
and the promise of a good meal!

967
01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:28.420
And I know exactly
what's going on here, okay?

968
01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:30.380
Punishment, isn't it? Ongoing.

969
01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:32.380
For something
that was clearly an accident.

970
01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:35.260
- You are Montgomery Scott.
- You know him?

971
01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:37.430
Aye, that's me. You're in the right place.

972
01:23:37.550 --> 01:23:40.680
Unless there's another hardworking,
equally starved Starfleet officer around.

973
01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:43.390
- Me.
- Get aff! Shut up!

974
01:23:43.470 --> 01:23:45.890
You don't eat anything!
You can eat, like, a bean,

975
01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:49.440
and you're done.
I'm talking about food. Real food.

976
01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:51.940
But you're here now, so thank you.
Where is it?

977
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:53.940
You are, in fact, the Mr Scott

978
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:56.240
who postulated
the theory of transwarp beaming.

979
01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:59.610
That's what I'm talking about.
How do you think I wound up here?

980
01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:01.200
I had a little debate with my instructor

981
01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:05.410
on the issue of relativistic physics
and how it pertains to subspace travel.

982
01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:09.420
He seemed to think that the range of
transporting something like a grapefruit

983
01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:11.000
was limited to about 100 miles.

984
01:24:11.130 --> 01:24:13.800
I told him that I could not only
beam a grapefruit from one planet

985
01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:15.880
to the adjacent planet
in the same system,

986
01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:17.630
which is easy, by the way,

987
01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:19.130
I could do it with a life-form.

988
01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:22.430
So, I tested it on Admiral Archer's
prize beagle.

989
01:24:22.510 --> 01:24:26.140
- I know that dog. What happened to it?
- I'll tell you when it reappears.

990
01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:28.100
I don't know. I do feel guilty about that.

991
01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:31.100
What if I told you
that your transwarp theory was correct,

992
01:24:31.190 --> 01:24:34.440
that it is indeed possible to beam onto
a ship that is travelling at warp speed?

993
01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:37.030
I think if that equation had been
discovered, I'd have heard about it.

994
01:24:37.150 --> 01:24:38.990
The reason you haven't heard of it,
Mr Scott,

995
01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:41.950
is because you haven't discovered it yet.

996
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:50.290
- Are you from the future?
- Yeah, he is. I'm not.

997
01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.670
Well, that's brilliant.
Do they still have sandwiches there?

998
01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:55.460
Well, she's a wee bit dodgy.

999
01:24:55.550 --> 01:24:59.420
Shield emitters are totally banjaxed,
as well as a few other things.

1000
01:24:59.510 --> 01:25:00.630
On youse go.

1001
01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:03.760
So the Enterprise has had
its maiden voyage, has it?

1002
01:25:03.850 --> 01:25:05.510
She is one well-endowed lady.

1003
01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:07.640
I'd like to get my hands
on her ample nacelles,

1004
01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:10.520
if you'll pardon
the engineering parlance.

1005
01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:14.150
Except, the thing is,
even if I believed you, right,

1006
01:25:14.230 --> 01:25:17.780
where you're from, what I've done,
which I don't, by the way,

1007
01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:20.320
you're still talking about
beaming aboard the Enterprise

1008
01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:23.280
while she's travelling faster than light
without a proper receiving pad.

1009
01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:26.160
Get off there! It's not a climbing frame.

1010
01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:30.910
The notion of transwarp beaming is like
trying to hit a bullet with a smaller bullet

1011
01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:33.880
whilst wearing a blindfold,
riding a horse.

1012
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000
What's that?

1013
01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:38.210
Your equation
for achieving transwarp beaming.

1014
01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:42.010
Get out of it.

1015
01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:47.010
Imagine that!

1016
01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:50.310
It never occurred to me to think of space
as the thing that was moving.

1017
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:52.730
You're coming with us, right?

1018
01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:58.020
- No, Jim. That is not my destiny.
- Your...

1019
01:25:59.030 --> 01:26:01.150
He... The other Spock
is not gonna believe me.

1020
01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:02.360
Only you can explain
what the hell's happened.

1021
01:26:02.450 --> 01:26:05.200
Under no circumstances
can he be made aware of my existence.

1022
01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:06.370
You must promise me this.

1023
01:26:06.450 --> 01:26:09.580
You're telling me I can't tell you
that I'm following your own orders?

1024
01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:13.250
- Why not? What happens?
- Jim, this is one rule you cannot break.

1025
01:26:13.370 --> 01:26:16.880
To stop Nero, you alone
must take command of your ship.

1026
01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:20.050
- How? Over your dead body?
- Preferably not.

1027
01:26:20.130 --> 01:26:23.130
However, there is
Starfleet Regulation 619.

1028
01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:26.390
Six-one-nine states
that any command officer

1029
01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:29.560
who's emotionally compromised
by the mission at hand

1030
01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:31.640
must resign said command.

1031
01:26:33.850 --> 01:26:37.980
So, you're saying that I have
to emotionally compromise you guys.

1032
01:26:38.110 --> 01:26:41.110
Jim, I just lost my planet.

1033
01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:45.200
I can tell you,
I am emotionally compromised.

1034
01:26:46.110 --> 01:26:48.910
What you must do is get me to show it.

1035
01:26:48.990 --> 01:26:52.540
Aye, then, laddie.
Live or die. Let's get this over with.

1036
01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:00.000
No, go. You cannae come with me.
Go on.

1037
01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:04.550
You know, coming back in time,
changing history,

1038
01:27:05.050 --> 01:27:06.510
that's cheating.

1039
01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:11.010
A trick I learned from an old friend.

1040
01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:22.650
Live long and prosper.

1041
01:27:42.750 --> 01:27:44.210
Mr Scott!

1042
01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:51.680
Mr Scott, can you hear me?

1043
01:27:59.230 --> 01:28:00.900
Hold on a second!

1044
01:28:01.730 --> 01:28:02.770
Oh, no.

1045
01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:08.030
Don't worry, I...

1046
01:28:18.790 --> 01:28:19.870
No. No!

1047
01:28:39.730 --> 01:28:42.230
Turbine release valve activated.

1048
01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:51.410
You all right? You all right?

1049
01:28:53.450 --> 01:28:55.910
My head's buzzing and I'm soaked,
but otherwise I'm fine.

1050
01:28:56.120 --> 01:29:02.040
Captain Spock! Detecting unauthorised
access to Water Turbine Control Board.

1051
01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:03.290
Bring up the video.

1052
01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:09.170
Security, seal the Engineering Deck.

1053
01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:12.130
We have intruders in Turbine Section 3.

1054
01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:13.430
Set phasers to stun.

1055
01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:26.940
- Halt!
- No, no!

1056
01:29:30.820 --> 01:29:33.660
Come with me, cupcake!

1057
01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:43.000
- Who are you?
- I'm with him.

1058
01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:45.420
- He's with me.
- We are travelling at warp speed.

1059
01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:47.090
How did you manage
to beam aboard this ship?

1060
01:29:47.170 --> 01:29:48.420
Well, you're the genius,
you figure it out.

1061
01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:51.630
As acting captain of this vessel,
I order you to answer the question.

1062
01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:54.800
Well, I'm not telling, Acting Captain.

1063
01:29:55.300 --> 01:29:56.300
What, did...

1064
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:59.470
That doesn't frustrate you, does it?
My lack of cooperation?

1065
01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:02.140
- That doesn't make you angry.
- Are you a member of Starfleet?

1066
01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:04.600
I... Yes. Can I get a towel, please?

1067
01:30:04.690 --> 01:30:06.900
Under penalty of court martial,
I order you to explain to me

1068
01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:09.320
how you were able to beam
aboard this ship while moving at warp.

1069
01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:10.860
- Well...
- Don't answer him.

1070
01:30:10.990 --> 01:30:12.650
You will answer me.

1071
01:30:14.410 --> 01:30:17.910
- I'd rather not take sides.
- What is it with you, Spock?

1072
01:30:19.830 --> 01:30:22.200
Your planet was just destroyed,
your mother murdered,

1073
01:30:22.330 --> 01:30:25.420
- and you're not even upset.
- If you are presuming

1074
01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:28.460
that these experiences in any way
impede my ability to command this ship,

1075
01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:30.300
- you are mistaken.
- And yet, you are the one

1076
01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:33.220
who said fear was necessary
for command.

1077
01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:36.720
I mean, did you see his ship?
Did you see what he did?

1078
01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:39.310
- Yes, of course I did.
- So are you afraid or aren't you?

1079
01:30:39.390 --> 01:30:41.640
I will not allow you to lecture me
about the merits of emotion.

1080
01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:43.940
- Then why don't you stop me?
- Step away from me, Mr Kirk.

1081
01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:47.360
What is it like not to feel anger?
Or heartbreak?

1082
01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:49.110
Or the need to stop at nothing

1083
01:30:49.190 --> 01:30:51.190
to avenge the death
of the woman who gave birth to you?

1084
01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:53.240
- Back away from me.
- You feel nothing!

1085
01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:55.530
It must not even compute for you.

1086
01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:57.370
You never loved her!

1087
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:23.560
Spock!

1088
01:32:01.010 --> 01:32:03.600
Doctor, I am no longer fit for duty.

1089
01:32:03.930 --> 01:32:05.520
I hereby relinquish my command,

1090
01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:09.650
based on the fact that I have been
emotionally compromised.

1091
01:32:09.770 --> 01:32:12.820
Please note the time and date
in the ship's log.

1092
01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:42.300
I like this ship! You know, it's exciting!

1093
01:32:45.060 --> 01:32:46.560
Well, congratulations, Jim.

1094
01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:50.980
Now we've got no captain, and
no goddamn first officer to replace him.

1095
01:32:52.020 --> 01:32:53.190
Yeah, we do.

1096
01:32:53.810 --> 01:32:56.360
- What?
- Pike made him first officer.

1097
01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:59.570
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Thanks for the support.

1098
01:33:02.490 --> 01:33:05.990
I sure hope you know
what you're doing, Captain.

1099
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:09.210
So do I.

1100
01:33:13.830 --> 01:33:16.210
Attention, crew of the Enterprise.
This is James Kirk.

1101
01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:22.010
Mr Spock has resigned commission
and advanced me to acting captain.

1102
01:33:22.510 --> 01:33:25.850
I know you were all expecting
to regroup with the fleet,

1103
01:33:25.930 --> 01:33:28.310
but I'm ordering a pursuit course
of the enemy ship to Earth.

1104
01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:31.690
I want all departments at battle stations
and ready in 10 minutes.

1105
01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:35.770
Either we're going down or they are.

1106
01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:38.610
Kirk out.

1107
01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:47.950
Speak your mind, Spock.

1108
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:52.580
That would be unwise.

1109
01:33:53.250 --> 01:33:56.710
What is necessary is never unwise.

1110
01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:01.220
I am as conflicted
as I once was as a child.

1111
01:34:03.130 --> 01:34:05.970
You will always be a child of two worlds.

1112
01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:09.640
I am grateful for this.

1113
01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:13.060
And for you.

1114
01:34:14.980 --> 01:34:18.230
I feel anger
for the one who took Mother's life.

1115
01:34:19.610 --> 01:34:21.820
An anger I cannot control.

1116
01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:31.080
I believe that she would say,

1117
01:34:32.580 --> 01:34:34.170
"Do not try to."

1118
01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:40.420
You asked me once
why I married your mother.

1119
01:34:44.430 --> 01:34:46.640
I married her because I loved her.

1120
01:34:54.810 --> 01:34:57.560
Whatever the case, we need
to get aboard Nero's ship undetected.

1121
01:34:57.650 --> 01:35:00.070
We can't just go in there guns blazing,
Jim, not with their technology.

1122
01:35:00.150 --> 01:35:02.320
I'm telling you, the math doesn't support
what you're suggesting.

1123
01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:04.530
- Captain Kirk. Captain Kirk!
- Yes, Mr Chekov. What is it?

1124
01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:06.740
Based on the Narada's course
from Vulcan,

1125
01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:10.080
I have projected that Nero
will travel past Saturn.

1126
01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:13.450
Like you said, we need to stay invisible
to Nero or he'll destroy us.

1127
01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:15.870
If Mr Scott can get us to warp factor 4,

1128
01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:20.630
and if we drop out of warp behind
one of Saturn's moons, say, Titan,

1129
01:35:20.710 --> 01:35:23.340
the magnetic distortion
from the planet's rings

1130
01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:25.630
will make us invisible to Nero's sensors.

1131
01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:28.090
From there,
as long as the drill is not actuated,

1132
01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:31.390
- we can beam aboard the enemy ship.
- Aye, that might work.

1133
01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:33.680
Wait a minute, kid. How old are you?

1134
01:35:33.770 --> 01:35:36.480
- Seventeen, sir.
- Oh, good, he's 17.

1135
01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:38.230
Doctor.

1136
01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:41.730
Mr Chekov is correct.
I can confirm his telemetry.

1137
01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:44.070
If Mr Sulu is able
to manoeuvre us into position,

1138
01:35:44.150 --> 01:35:46.900
I can beam aboard Nero's ship,
steal back the black hole device

1139
01:35:46.990 --> 01:35:49.740
and, if possible,
bring back Captain Pike.

1140
01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:52.530
I won't allow you to do that, Mr Spock.

1141
01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:55.660
Romulans and Vulcans
share a common ancestry.

1142
01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:57.790
Our cultural similarities
will make it easier for me

1143
01:35:57.870 --> 01:36:01.040
to access the ship's computer
to locate the device.

1144
01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:04.380
Also, my mother was human,

1145
01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:07.470
which makes Earth
the only home I have left.

1146
01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:15.810
Then I'm coming with you.

1147
01:36:15.890 --> 01:36:19.940
I would cite Regulation,
but I know you will simply ignore it.

1148
01:36:21.690 --> 01:36:24.480
See? We are
getting to know each other.

1149
01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:41.630
Prepare the drill.

1150
01:36:57.850 --> 01:37:03.400
All stop in three, two, one.

1151
01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:11.530
Give me one-quarter impulse burst
for five seconds.

1152
01:37:11.610 --> 01:37:13.490
I'll do the rest with thrusters.
On my mark.

1153
01:37:13.570 --> 01:37:15.830
- Aye.
- Fire.

1154
01:37:43.060 --> 01:37:45.810
Transporter Room.
We are in position above Titan.

1155
01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:48.360
Really? Fine job, Mr Sulu. Well done.

1156
01:37:49.530 --> 01:37:53.320
- How are we, Scotty?
- Unbelievably, sir, the ship is in position.

1157
01:37:56.490 --> 01:37:58.620
Whatever happens, Mr Sulu,

1158
01:37:58.700 --> 01:38:00.410
if you think you have
the tactical advantage,

1159
01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:04.080
you fire on that ship, even if we're still
onboard. That's an order.

1160
01:38:05.630 --> 01:38:06.790
Yes, sir.

1161
01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:10.880
Otherwise we'll contact the Enterprise
when we're ready to be beamed back.

1162
01:38:11.010 --> 01:38:12.220
Good luck.

1163
01:38:25.150 --> 01:38:28.070
- I will be back.
- You better be.

1164
01:38:29.860 --> 01:38:32.860
- I'll be monitoring your frequency.
- Thank you, Nyota.

1165
01:38:49.670 --> 01:38:52.460
- So her first name's Nyota?
- I have no comment on the matter.

1166
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:54.430
Okey-dokey, then,
if there's any common sense

1167
01:38:54.510 --> 01:38:55.800
in the design of the enemy ship,

1168
01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:57.850
I should be putting you
somewhere in the Cargo Bay.

1169
01:38:57.930 --> 01:39:00.640
- Shouldn't be a soul in sight.
- Energise.

1170
01:39:43.930 --> 01:39:46.310
Captain, we have Starfleet officers
aboard the ship.

1171
01:39:46.690 --> 01:39:48.810
- One of them is Vulcan.
- No.

1172
01:39:53.570 --> 01:39:54.650
Ayel!

1173
01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:10.630
I'll cover you.

1174
01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:13.000
- Are you certain?
- Yeah, I got you.

1175
01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:36.150
Do you know where it is?
The black hole device.

1176
01:40:38.030 --> 01:40:39.700
And Captain Pike.

1177
01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:03.640
Move!

1178
01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:06.220
They have activated the drill.

1179
01:41:07.390 --> 01:41:09.060
Communication and transport
are inoperative.

1180
01:41:09.140 --> 01:41:10.600
Sulu, please tell me you have them.

1181
01:41:10.690 --> 01:41:12.350
Otherwise we won't be able
to beam them back.

1182
01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:14.020
Kirk and Spock are on their own now.

1183
01:41:33.250 --> 01:41:34.630
I foresee a complication.

1184
01:41:34.710 --> 01:41:37.340
The design of their ship is far
more advanced than I had anticipated.

1185
01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:40.420
Voice print and face recognition
analysis enabled.

1186
01:41:40.510 --> 01:41:42.630
Welcome back, Ambassador Spock.

1187
01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:44.260
Wow, that's weird.

1188
01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:48.220
Computer, what is
your manufacturing origin?

1189
01:41:48.350 --> 01:41:52.770
Stardate 2387. Commissioned
by the Vulcan Science Academy.

1190
01:41:55.690 --> 01:41:58.280
It appears that you have been keeping
important information from me.

1191
01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:00.400
You're gonna be able
to fly this thing, right?

1192
01:42:00.530 --> 01:42:02.950
Something tells me I already have.

1193
01:42:03.530 --> 01:42:05.120
- Good luck.
- Jim.

1194
01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:09.620
The statistical likelihood that our plan
will succeed is less than 4.3%.

1195
01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:11.790
- It'll work.
- In the event that I do not return,

1196
01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:13.870
- please tell Lieutenant Uhura...
- Spock!

1197
01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:15.710
It'll work.

1198
01:42:25.470 --> 01:42:26.970
Fascinating.

1199
01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:37.610
Start-up sequence initiated.

1200
01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:23.940
Nero, order your men to disable the drill
or I will...

1201
01:43:34.620 --> 01:43:37.620
I know your face from Earth's history.

1202
01:44:22.670 --> 01:44:26.210
James T. Kirk was considered
to be a great man.

1203
01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:28.680
He went on to captain
the U. S. S. Enterprise.

1204
01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:30.090
But that was another life.

1205
01:44:30.930 --> 01:44:34.100
A life I will deprive you of,
just like I did your father.

1206
01:45:06.590 --> 01:45:10.880
Captain Nero. The Vulcan ship has been
taken. The drill has been destroyed.

1207
01:45:11.260 --> 01:45:12.300
Spock!

1208
01:45:14.050 --> 01:45:15.600
Spock!

1209
01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:34.660
- Open a channel.
- Yes, sir!

1210
01:45:36.450 --> 01:45:39.410
Spock. I knew I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

1211
01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:41.750
I hereby confiscate
this illegally obtained ship

1212
01:45:41.830 --> 01:45:42.960
and order you to surrender your vessel.

1213
01:45:43.170 --> 01:45:45.170
- No terms. No deals.
- That ship, take it out.

1214
01:45:45.250 --> 01:45:46.460
Sir, if you ignite the red matter,

1215
01:45:46.590 --> 01:45:48.000
- you'll destroy...
- I want Spock dead now!

1216
01:46:03.980 --> 01:46:05.810
- He went to warp, sir.
- Go after him!

1217
01:46:05.940 --> 01:46:07.150
Yes, sir!

1218
01:46:37.300 --> 01:46:40.350
Your species is even weaker
than I expected.

1219
01:46:41.730 --> 01:46:43.850
- I can't...
- You can't what?

1220
01:46:43.980 --> 01:46:45.520
You can't even speak.

1221
01:46:48.150 --> 01:46:50.860
- What?
- I got your gun.

1222
01:47:17.550 --> 01:47:18.680
What's he doing?

1223
01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:22.020
Ambassador Spock,
you are on a collision course.

1224
01:47:22.770 --> 01:47:23.850
Fire everything!

1225
01:47:31.190 --> 01:47:35.400
Incoming missiles. If the ship is hit,
the red matter will be ignited.

1226
01:47:35.530 --> 01:47:36.910
Understood.

1227
01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:44.750
Captain, I've picked up another ship!

1228
01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:09.730
- What are you doing here?
- Just following orders.

1229
01:48:29.580 --> 01:48:30.670
Enterprise, now!

1230
01:48:54.110 --> 01:48:55.820
Nice timing, Scotty!

1231
01:48:56.780 --> 01:49:00.700
I've never beamed three people
from two targets onto one pad before!

1232
01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:02.660
- Jim!
- Bones!

1233
01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:04.370
I got him.

1234
01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:07.620
That was pretty good!

1235
01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:12.170
Captain, the enemy ship is losing
power! Their shields are down, sir.

1236
01:49:12.290 --> 01:49:13.670
- Hail them now.
- Aye.

1237
01:49:48.830 --> 01:49:51.710
This is Captain James T. Kirk
of the U. S. S. Enterprise.

1238
01:49:52.170 --> 01:49:53.500
Your ship is compromised.

1239
01:49:53.580 --> 01:49:56.090
Too close to the singularity
to survive without assistance,

1240
01:49:56.170 --> 01:49:58.000
which we are willing to provide.

1241
01:50:01.340 --> 01:50:03.760
- Captain, what are you doing?
- Showing them compassion

1242
01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:05.550
may be the only way
to earn peace with Romulus.

1243
01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:08.680
It's logic, Spock.
I thought you'd like that.

1244
01:50:08.770 --> 01:50:11.480
No, not really. Not this time.

1245
01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:16.060
I would rather suffer the end of Romulus
a thousand times.

1246
01:50:16.190 --> 01:50:20.400
I would rather die in agony
than accept assistance from you.

1247
01:50:20.530 --> 01:50:22.280
You got it.

1248
01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:25.240
- Arm phasers. Fire everything we've got.
- Yes, sir.

1249
01:51:10.410 --> 01:51:12.750
- Sulu, let's go home.
- Yes, sir!

1250
01:51:24.090 --> 01:51:26.090
- Why aren't we at warp?
- We are, sir.

1251
01:51:26.180 --> 01:51:28.390
Kirk to Engineering.
Get us out of here, Scotty.

1252
01:51:28.470 --> 01:51:29.800
You bet your ass, Captain!

1253
01:51:33.470 --> 01:51:35.520
Captain, we're caught in the gravity well!
It's got us!

1254
01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:39.110
- Go to maximum warp! Push it!
- I'm giving her all she's got, Captain!

1255
01:51:48.450 --> 01:51:49.910
All she's got isn't good enough!

1256
01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:53.370
- What else you got?
- Okay, if we eject the core and detonate,

1257
01:51:53.450 --> 01:51:54.750
the blast could be enough
to push us away.

1258
01:51:54.830 --> 01:51:56.000
I cannae promise anything, though!

1259
01:51:59.630 --> 01:52:01.130
Do it, do it, do it!

1260
01:52:02.300 --> 01:52:04.130
- Clear the area! Go!
- Yes, sir!

1261
01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:33.260
Father!

1262
01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:43.400
I am not our father.

1263
01:53:51.070 --> 01:53:55.740
There are so few Vulcans left.
We cannot afford to ignore each other.

1264
01:53:58.830 --> 01:54:00.000
Then why did you send Kirk aboard

1265
01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:02.000
when you alone
could have explained the truth?

1266
01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:05.540
Because you needed each other.
I could not deprive you

1267
01:54:05.630 --> 01:54:08.300
of the revelation of all
that you could accomplish together,

1268
01:54:08.420 --> 01:54:13.590
of a friendship that will define you both
in ways you cannot yet realise.

1269
01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:17.600
How did you persuade him
to keep your secret?

1270
01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:21.060
He inferred that universe-ending
paradoxes would ensue

1271
01:54:21.140 --> 01:54:23.600
- should he break his promise.
- You lied.

1272
01:54:24.980 --> 01:54:27.150
I... I implied.

1273
01:54:27.650 --> 01:54:29.690
- A gamble.
- An act of faith.

1274
01:54:30.780 --> 01:54:33.990
One I hope that you'll repeat
in the future in Starfleet.

1275
01:54:34.110 --> 01:54:35.700
In the face of extinction, it is only logical

1276
01:54:35.780 --> 01:54:38.490
I resign my Starfleet commission
and help rebuild our race.

1277
01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:40.870
And yet,
you can be in two places at once.

1278
01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:44.960
I urge you to remain in Starfleet.

1279
01:54:45.330 --> 01:54:49.670
I have already located a suitable planet
on which to establish a Vulcan colony.

1280
01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:53.510
Spock, in this case, do yourself a favour.

1281
01:54:55.010 --> 01:54:58.300
Put aside logic. Do what feels right.

1282
01:55:04.140 --> 01:55:07.860
Since my customary farewell
would appear oddly self-serving,

1283
01:55:07.980 --> 01:55:09.190
I shall simply say

1284
01:55:10.230 --> 01:55:11.690
good luck.

1285
01:55:22.580 --> 01:55:26.330
This assembly calls Captain
James Tiberius Kirk.

1286
01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:30.340
Your inspirational valour and
supreme dedication to your comrades

1287
01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:33.090
is in keeping with
the highest traditions of service,

1288
01:55:33.170 --> 01:55:38.010
and reflect utmost credit to yourself,
your crew and the Federation.

1289
01:55:39.050 --> 01:55:42.010
It is my honour to award you
with this commendation.

1290
01:55:46.690 --> 01:55:48.690
By Starfleet Order 28455,

1291
01:55:48.770 --> 01:55:52.860
you are hereby directed to report
to Admiral Pike, U. S. S. Enterprise,

1292
01:55:52.940 --> 01:55:54.690
for duty as his relief.

1293
01:56:03.580 --> 01:56:05.290
I relieve you, sir.

1294
01:56:05.710 --> 01:56:07.540
I am relieved.

1295
01:56:09.380 --> 01:56:11.920
- Thank you, sir.
- Congratulations, Captain.

1296
01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:15.720
Your father would be proud.

1297
01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:46.830
Thrusters on full.

1298
01:56:47.410 --> 01:56:50.250
Manoeuvring thrusters and
impulse engines at your command, sir.

1299
01:56:50.330 --> 01:56:52.960
Weapons systems and shields
on standby.

1300
01:56:53.090 --> 01:56:55.670
Dock Control reports ready, Captain.

1301
01:57:00.180 --> 01:57:03.010
Bones! Buckle up.

1302
01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:09.060
Scotty, how we doing?

1303
01:57:09.140 --> 01:57:11.810
Dilithium chamber's
at maximum, Captain.

1304
01:57:12.860 --> 01:57:14.270
Get down!

1305
01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:19.280
Mr Sulu, prepare to engage thrusters.

1306
01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:24.660
Permission to come aboard, Captain.

1307
01:57:25.030 --> 01:57:26.790
Permission granted.

1308
01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:29.620
As you have yet to select a first officer,

1309
01:57:29.710 --> 01:57:32.790
respectfully I would like to submit
my candidacy.

1310
01:57:33.330 --> 01:57:36.800
Should you desire,
I can provide character references.

1311
01:57:37.210 --> 01:57:39.510
It would be my honour, Commander.

1312
01:57:43.180 --> 01:57:45.640
Manoeuvring thrusters, Mr Sulu.

1313
01:57:47.350 --> 01:57:49.270
Thrusters on standby.

1314
01:57:49.350 --> 01:57:51.640
- Take us out.
- Aye-aye, Captain.

1315
01:57:56.650 --> 01:57:59.860
Space, the final frontier.

1316
01:58:01.650 --> 01:58:05.160
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

1317
01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:10.000
Her ongoing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,

1318
01:58:10.750 --> 01:58:14.580
to seek out new life-forms
and new civilizations,

1319
01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:19.590
to boldly go
where no one has gone before.
