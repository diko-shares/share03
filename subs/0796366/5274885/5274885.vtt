1
00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:21.003
<i>U.S.S. Kelvin, go for Starfleet Base.</i>

2
00:01:21.103 --> 00:01:24.037
<i>Starfleet Base, we sent you
a transmission. Did you receive?</i>

3
00:01:24.137 --> 00:01:25.558
<i>Kelvin, have you double-checked
those readings?</i>

4
00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:28.429
<i>Our gravitational sensors are
going crazy here. You should see this.</i>

5
00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:29.738
<i>It looks like a lightning storm.</i>

6
00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:31.279
<i>What you have sent us
doesn't seem possible.</i>

7
00:01:31.514 --> 00:01:33.641
<i>Yes, ma'am. I understand.
That's why we sent it.</i>

8
00:01:34.117 --> 00:01:34.792
Report.

9
00:01:34.793 --> 00:01:35.906
Still out of visual range.

10
00:01:35.907 --> 00:01:36.830
20 seconds.

11
00:01:36.831 --> 00:01:40.617
Alert Captain Robau that Starfleet
advises your ship to proceed with caution.

12
00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:42.389
Polarize the viewscreen.

13
00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:44.025
<i>Could whatever this is
be of Klingon origin?</i>

14
00:01:44.025 --> 00:01:45.258
Captain, we have visual.

15
00:01:45.558 --> 00:01:47.139
Repeat. Could this be Klingon?

16
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.654
<i>Negative, Lieutenant.</i>

17
00:01:48.754 --> 00:01:50.098
<i>You're 75,000 kilometers from...</i>

18
00:01:50.298 --> 00:01:51.665
Captain, are you seeing this?

19
00:01:54.504 --> 00:01:55.528
My God.

20
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.857
I have a reading.

21
00:02:17.957 --> 00:02:19.461
They have locked weapons on us.

22
00:02:19.462 --> 00:02:19.926
Red alert.

23
00:02:19.926 --> 00:02:22.189
Torpedo locked on us at 320 degrees,

24
00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:23.622
mark 2.
Arm weapons.

25
00:02:25.702 --> 00:02:27.164
Evasive pattern Delta 5.

26
00:02:29.005 --> 00:02:30.165
Incoming, fast.

27
00:02:36.513 --> 00:02:38.082
Fire all phasers.

28
00:02:38.683 --> 00:02:39.475
Damage report.

29
00:02:39.675 --> 00:02:42.145
<i>Warp drive's been knocked out.
Never seen anything like it.</i>

30
00:02:43.553 --> 00:02:45.845
Weapons are off-line.
Main power at 38%.

31
00:02:45.846 --> 00:02:47.820
They're firing another.
All power to forward shields.

32
00:02:56.533 --> 00:02:57.698
Lieutenant.

33
00:03:03.006 --> 00:03:05.006
Atmospheric stabilization has been lost.

34
00:03:05.007 --> 00:03:07.241
Were our shields even up?
Oxygen failing, Decks 7 to 13.

35
00:03:07.242 --> 00:03:08.851
We have confirmed casualties, sir.
Shields 11% and dropping.

36
00:03:08.852 --> 00:03:10.611
Ten percent. Shields at nine.
We're dropping here.

37
00:03:10.612 --> 00:03:12.309
All remaining power to forward shields.

38
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.382
Prepare shuttles for evacuation.

39
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.920
<i>Hello.</i>

40
00:03:19.555 --> 00:03:21.751
<i>My commander requests
the presence of your Captain,</i>

41
00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:24.090
<i>in order to negotiate a cease-fire.</i>

42
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.729
<i>You will come aboard our ship
via shuttlecraft.</i>

43
00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:30.158
<i>Your refusal would be unwise.</i>

44
00:03:42.846 --> 00:03:44.079
Walk with me.

45
00:03:50.286 --> 00:03:52.173
If I don't report in 15 minutes,

46
00:03:52.174 --> 00:03:53.417
evacuate the crew.

47
00:03:53.517 --> 00:03:55.919
Sir, we could issue...
There is no help for us out here.

48
00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.659
Use autopilot.

49
00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:00.518
And get off this ship.

50
00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:01.561
Aye, Captain.

51
00:04:01.561 --> 00:04:03.459
You're Captain now, Mr. Kirk.

52
00:05:16.973 --> 00:05:18.664
His heart rate's elevated.

53
00:05:41.364 --> 00:05:42.825
Look at this ship.

54
00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:46.790
Are you familiar with this craft?

55
00:05:46.791 --> 00:05:47.930
Who is your commander?

56
00:05:49.506 --> 00:05:52.669
Is it him?
I will speak for Captain Nero.

57
00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:54.401
Then ask Captain Nero,

58
00:05:54.602 --> 00:05:55.782
what gives him the right,

59
00:05:56.183 --> 00:05:58.005
to attack a Federation vessel?

60
00:06:11.094 --> 00:06:14.063
Do you know the location
of Ambassador Spock?

61
00:06:17.167 --> 00:06:19.627
I am unfamiliar with Ambassador Spock.

62
00:06:21.404 --> 00:06:23.259
What is the current stardate?

63
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.134
Stardate?

64
00:06:26.376 --> 00:06:28.236
222304

65
00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.009
Where are you from?

66
00:06:40.423 --> 00:06:42.154
Sir, they're locked on our signal.
They're launching again.

67
00:06:42.254 --> 00:06:44.248
Bravo-six maneuver.
Fire full spread.

68
00:06:53.403 --> 00:06:54.522
Seventeen more out.

69
00:06:55.023 --> 00:06:56.865
I am initiating General Order 13.

70
00:06:56.866 --> 00:06:57.738
We're evacuating.

71
00:06:58.139 --> 00:06:59.102
Yes, sir.

72
00:07:03.713 --> 00:07:06.942
All decks, this is the Captain speaking.
Evacuate the ship immediately!

73
00:07:07.217 --> 00:07:09.144
Get to your designated shuttlecraft.
Repeat. Evacuate...

74
00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:11.104
That's George's voice.
What's happening?

75
00:07:11.179 --> 00:07:12.655
You'll deliver in the shuttle. Go!

76
00:07:18.436 --> 00:07:21.191
Move! This one's closed!
Let's go! Get him up!

77
00:07:22.566 --> 00:07:23.566
I'm on my way!

78
00:07:25.735 --> 00:07:27.162
George.
<i>You're ok. Thank God.</i>

79
00:07:27.237 --> 00:07:30.499
I have medical shuttle 37 standing by.
Get to it now. Can you do that?

80
00:07:30.574 --> 00:07:32.167
Yes.
<i>Everything's gonna be ok.</i>

81
00:07:32.242 --> 00:07:34.458
<i>Do exactly as I say. Shuttle 37.</i>

82
00:07:34.459 --> 00:07:36.138
George, it's coming.

83
00:07:36.413 --> 00:07:39.071
Our baby, it's coming now.

84
00:07:39.072 --> 00:07:39.882
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

85
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:47.931
<i>Autopilot function has been destroyed.</i>

86
00:07:48.466 --> 00:07:50.417
<i>Manual operation only.</i>

87
00:07:51.261 --> 00:07:52.561
Clear those decks now!

88
00:07:52.562 --> 00:07:54.088
Get to the shuttles!
Move, move, move!

89
00:07:54.089 --> 00:07:55.999
Get to the hangar deck!
Get to the hangar deck! Let's move it!

90
00:07:58.810 --> 00:07:59.808
That was a big one.

91
00:07:59.809 --> 00:08:01.488
Just keep breathing.
You'll be fine.

92
00:08:01.563 --> 00:08:02.970
And the baby, too, right?

93
00:08:02.971 --> 00:08:04.315
And the baby, too.

94
00:08:04.316 --> 00:08:05.316
Go! Go, go!

95
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.291
Right here.

96
00:08:11.005 --> 00:08:12.147
Go ahead and sit back.

97
00:08:16.161 --> 00:08:18.572
<i>Captain to shuttle 37.
Is my wife on board?</i>

98
00:08:18.747 --> 00:08:19.870
Yes, sir, she is.

99
00:08:19.871 --> 00:08:21.383
I need you to go now.
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

100
00:08:21.458 --> 00:08:22.489
We're waiting on you, sir.
<i>No.</i>

101
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:24.384
Just go. Take off immediately.

102
00:08:24.461 --> 00:08:25.520
<i>That's an order.</i>

103
00:08:25.521 --> 00:08:26.513
Yes, sir.

104
00:08:26.588 --> 00:08:28.597
No, wait! We can't go yet!

105
00:08:31.134 --> 00:08:33.577
Please stop! Stop!

106
00:08:35.096 --> 00:08:35.777
<i>George?</i>

107
00:08:36.278 --> 00:08:37.737
The shuttle's leaving.

108
00:08:37.738 --> 00:08:38.738
Where are you?

109
00:08:38.808 --> 00:08:40.217
Sweetheart, listen to me.

110
00:08:40.936 --> 00:08:42.479
<i>I'm not gonna be there.</i>

111
00:08:42.854 --> 00:08:43.305
No.

112
00:08:43.506 --> 00:08:45.073
This is the only way you'll survive.

113
00:08:45.148 --> 00:08:46.433
Are you still on the ship?

114
00:08:46.734 --> 00:08:47.784
You have to be here!

115
00:08:48.059 --> 00:08:50.195
The shuttles will never make it
if I don't fight them off.

116
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.123
George, I can't do this without you.

117
00:08:53.198 --> 00:08:55.674
Ok, I need you to push now.

118
00:10:13.153 --> 00:10:14.027
What is it?

119
00:10:14.028 --> 00:10:14.938
It's a boy.

120
00:10:15.113 --> 00:10:16.113
A boy?

121
00:10:17.741 --> 00:10:18.774
<i>Tell me about him.</i>

122
00:10:19.993 --> 00:10:21.944
<i>He's beautiful.</i>

123
00:10:23.747 --> 00:10:25.614
George, you should be here.

124
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.600
<i>Impact alert.</i>

125
00:10:30.587 --> 00:10:31.829
What are we gonna call him?

126
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:34.431
We can name him after your father.

127
00:10:34.591 --> 00:10:37.534
Tiberius? You kidding me?
No, that's the worst.

128
00:10:39.512 --> 00:10:42.314
Let's name him after your dad.
Let's call him Jim.

129
00:10:44.642 --> 00:10:48.220
Jim. Ok. Jim it is.

130
00:10:52.609 --> 00:10:53.868
Sweetheart, can you hear me?

131
00:10:53.869 --> 00:10:54.895
I hear you!

132
00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:56.357
I love you so much.

133
00:10:58.258 --> 00:10:58.939
I love you...

134
00:12:17.026 --> 00:12:19.295
<i>Hey, are you out of your mind?
That car is an antique.</i>

135
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:21.738
<i>You think you can get away with this
just because your mother's off planet?</i>

136
00:12:21.739 --> 00:12:24.125
<i>You get your ass back home.
Now!</i>

137
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.515
<i>You live in my house, buddy.</i>

138
00:12:25.516 --> 00:12:27.921
<i>You live in my house,
and that's my car.</i>

139
00:12:27.996 --> 00:12:30.973
<i>You get one scratch on that car,
and I'm gonna whip your...</i>

140
00:12:44.053 --> 00:12:45.854
Yeah!

141
00:12:55.064 --> 00:12:56.340
Hey, Johnny!

142
00:13:16.586 --> 00:13:19.054
Citizen! Pull over.

143
00:13:45.323 --> 00:13:47.582
No!

144
00:14:13.142 --> 00:14:14.710
Is there a problem, Officer?

145
00:14:15.812 --> 00:14:17.780
Citizen, what is your name?

146
00:14:18.481 --> 00:14:20.474
My name is James Tiberius Kirk.

147
00:14:39.127 --> 00:14:41.721
<i>What is the formula
for the volume of a sphere?</i>

148
00:14:41.796 --> 00:14:44.399
Four-thirds pi times the radius cubed.

149
00:14:44.674 --> 00:14:46.835
1-point-2-6. An ellipse.

150
00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:48.811
<i>What is the electrical charge
of an up-type quark?</i>

151
00:14:48.886 --> 00:14:50.430
Positive two-thirds.

152
00:14:50.805 --> 00:14:55.652
<i>What is the square root of 2,396,324?</i>

153
00:14:55.727 --> 00:14:57.612
<i>1,548.
What is the dimensionality...</i>

154
00:14:57.687 --> 00:15:00.448
Dimensionality equals the logarithm
and divided by...

155
00:15:00.523 --> 00:15:04.285
Non-excludability and non-rivalry...
Four-thirds pi times the radius cubed.

156
00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.730
When it is morally praiseworthy
but not morally obligatory.

157
00:15:11.159 --> 00:15:12.159
Spock!

158
00:15:14.495 --> 00:15:17.399
I presume you've prepared
new insults for today.

159
00:15:17.874 --> 00:15:18.874
Affirmative.

160
00:15:27.425 --> 00:15:31.145
This is your thirty-fifth attempt to elicit
an emotional response from me.

161
00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.220
You're neither human nor Vulcan, and
therefore have no place in this universe.

162
00:15:34.221 --> 00:15:35.496
Look. He has human eyes.

163
00:15:35.497 --> 00:15:37.193
They look sad, don't they?

164
00:15:37.268 --> 00:15:39.971
Perhaps an emotional response
requires physical stimuli.

165
00:15:42.398 --> 00:15:43.750
He's a traitor, you know.

166
00:15:43.751 --> 00:15:45.800
Your father.
For marrying her.

167
00:15:46.201 --> 00:15:47.727
That human whore.

168
00:16:16.099 --> 00:16:17.941
They called you a traitor.

169
00:16:22.939 --> 00:16:25.399
Emotions run deep within our race.

170
00:16:25.983 --> 00:16:28.611
In many ways,
more deeply than in humans.

171
00:16:28.986 --> 00:16:32.572
Logic offers a serenity
humans seldom experience.

172
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:34.705
The control of feelings,

173
00:16:35.206 --> 00:16:37.886
so that they do not control you.

174
00:16:40.915 --> 00:16:44.184
You suggest that I should be
completely Vulcan,

175
00:16:44.627 --> 00:16:46.363
and yet you married a human.

176
00:16:46.838 --> 00:16:49.089
As ambassador to Earth,
it is my duty,

177
00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:51.600
to observe and understand
human behaviour.

178
00:16:52.343 --> 00:16:54.036
Marrying your mother was...

179
00:16:55.638 --> 00:16:56.638
logical.

180
00:16:59.475 --> 00:17:00.496
Spock.

181
00:17:00.897 --> 00:17:04.612
You are fully capable of deciding
your own destiny.

182
00:17:05.648 --> 00:17:07.387
The question you face is,

183
00:17:08.788 --> 00:17:10.685
which path will you choose?

184
00:17:11.988 --> 00:17:14.356
This is something only you
can decide.

185
00:17:20.163 --> 00:17:23.073
Spock, come here, let me see you.

186
00:17:25.142 --> 00:17:25.994
No.

187
00:17:26.795 --> 00:17:27.744
Spock.

188
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:37.528
There's no need to be anxious.

189
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:39.841
You'll do fine.

190
00:17:40.016 --> 00:17:41.976
I am hardly anxious, Mother.

191
00:17:42.351 --> 00:17:45.262
And fine has variable definitions.
Fine is unacceptable.

192
00:17:46.981 --> 00:17:47.981
Ok.

193
00:17:55.698 --> 00:17:57.566
May I ask a personal query?

194
00:17:58.167 --> 00:17:59.167
Anything.

195
00:18:01.662 --> 00:18:04.599
Should I choose to complete
the Vulcan discipline of Kolinahr,

196
00:18:06.042 --> 00:18:07.743
and purge all emotion,

197
00:18:10.046 --> 00:18:13.281
I trust you will not feel
it reflects judgment upon you.

198
00:18:16.385 --> 00:18:17.385
Spock.

199
00:18:20.097 --> 00:18:23.358
As always, whatever you choose to be,

200
00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.753
you will have a proud mother.

201
00:18:31.359 --> 00:18:35.129
You have surpassed the expectations
of your instructors.

202
00:18:35.404 --> 00:18:37.768
Your final record is flawless,

203
00:18:37.769 --> 00:18:39.341
with one exception.

204
00:18:39.617 --> 00:18:43.021
I see that you have applied
to Starfleet as well.

205
00:18:43.496 --> 00:18:45.840
It was logical
to cultivate multiple options.

206
00:18:45.915 --> 00:18:47.909
Logical, but unnecessary.

207
00:18:48.084 --> 00:18:51.179
You are hereby accepted
to the Vulcan Science Academy.

208
00:18:51.254 --> 00:18:52.764
It is truly remarkable Spock,

209
00:18:52.839 --> 00:18:56.474
that you have achieved so much,
despite your disadvantage.

210
00:18:56.843 --> 00:18:58.276
All rise!

211
00:19:01.889 --> 00:19:03.724
If you would clarify Minister,

212
00:19:05.101 --> 00:19:07.196
to what disadvantage are you referring?

213
00:19:07.397 --> 00:19:08.903
Your human mother.

214
00:19:13.901 --> 00:19:14.931
Council.

215
00:19:15.232 --> 00:19:16.871
Ministers, I must decline.

216
00:19:16.946 --> 00:19:19.707
No Vulcan has ever declined
admission to this Academy.

217
00:19:19.782 --> 00:19:22.543
Then as I am half human,
your record remains untarnished.

218
00:19:22.618 --> 00:19:26.339
Spock, you have made a commitment
to honour the Vulcan way.

219
00:19:26.414 --> 00:19:28.516
Why did you come
before this council today?

220
00:19:28.791 --> 00:19:31.385
Was it to satisfy
your emotional need to rebel?

221
00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.946
The only emotion I wish to convey
is gratitude.

222
00:19:35.548 --> 00:19:37.561
Thank you, Ministers,

223
00:19:37.762 --> 00:19:39.334
for your consideration.

224
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:42.388
Live long and prosper.

225
00:19:58.821 --> 00:19:59.821
How are you?
Hey.

226
00:20:05.393 --> 00:20:06.793
Hi.
Hey.

227
00:20:07.294 --> 00:20:07.894
Hi.

228
00:20:11.684 --> 00:20:12.332
Hi.

229
00:20:12.533 --> 00:20:14.281
I'd like a Klabnian Fire Tea...

230
00:20:15.282 --> 00:20:17.081
3 Budweiser Classics...

231
00:20:17.256 --> 00:20:19.758
2 Cardassian Sunrises and...

232
00:20:19.759 --> 00:20:21.185
Gotta try the Slusho. It's good.

233
00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:22.695
The Slusho mix. Thank you.

234
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:24.839
That's a lot of drinks for one woman.

235
00:20:27.183 --> 00:20:28.663
And a shot of Jack, straight up.

236
00:20:28.664 --> 00:20:29.861
Make that two. Her shot's on me.

237
00:20:29.936 --> 00:20:32.113
Her shot's on her. Thanks but no thanks.

238
00:20:32.188 --> 00:20:33.988
Don't you want to at least
know my name

239
00:20:34.023 --> 00:20:35.575
before you completely reject me?

240
00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:37.017
I'm fine without it.

241
00:20:37.018 --> 00:20:38.653
You are fine without it.

242
00:20:39.028 --> 00:20:40.546
It's Jim. Jim Kirk.

243
00:20:42.698 --> 00:20:45.727
If you don't tell me your name,
I'm gonna have to make one up.

244
00:20:46.702 --> 00:20:47.640
It's Uhura.

245
00:20:47.641 --> 00:20:48.921
Uhura? No way!

246
00:20:48.996 --> 00:20:50.965
That's the name
I was gonna make up for you.

247
00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:52.558
Uhura what?

248
00:20:52.859 --> 00:20:53.926
Just Uhura.

249
00:20:54.001 --> 00:20:55.595
They don't have last names
in your world?

250
00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:57.096
Uhura is my last name.

251
00:20:57.171 --> 00:20:58.304
Well, they don't have...

252
00:20:58.705 --> 00:21:00.140
first names in your world?

253
00:21:01.884 --> 00:21:03.102
Excuse me, buddy.

254
00:21:03.277 --> 00:21:05.521
So, you're a cadet, you're studying.

255
00:21:05.522 --> 00:21:07.506
What's your focus?
Xenolinguistics.

256
00:21:07.507 --> 00:21:08.816
You have no idea what that means.

257
00:21:08.891 --> 00:21:13.661
The study of alien languages.
Morphology, phonology, syntax.

258
00:21:14.355 --> 00:21:16.083
It means you've got a talented tongue.

259
00:21:17.358 --> 00:21:18.676
I'm impressed.

260
00:21:19.151 --> 00:21:21.162
For a moment there,
I thought you were just a dumb hick

261
00:21:21.237 --> 00:21:23.254
who only has sex with farm animals.

262
00:21:23.255 --> 00:21:26.157
Well, not only.

263
00:21:27.493 --> 00:21:29.654
This townie isn't bothering you, right?

264
00:21:29.829 --> 00:21:30.986
Beyond belief.

265
00:21:30.987 --> 00:21:32.340
But it's nothing I can't handle.

266
00:21:32.415 --> 00:21:34.467
You could handle me.
That's an invitation.

267
00:21:34.542 --> 00:21:38.846
Hey, you better mind your manners.
Relax, cupcake. It was a joke.

268
00:21:38.921 --> 00:21:40.288
Hey, farm boy.

269
00:21:40.489 --> 00:21:41.747
Maybe you can't count,

270
00:21:42.148 --> 00:21:43.843
but there are four of us
and one of you.

271
00:21:43.918 --> 00:21:46.962
So get some more guys,
and then it'll be an even fight.

272
00:21:50.433 --> 00:21:52.300
Guys, stop it.

273
00:21:54.603 --> 00:21:55.695
Stop it!

274
00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:18.460
Enough!

275
00:22:26.385 --> 00:22:27.919
Guys, he's had enough!

276
00:22:33.142 --> 00:22:35.276
Outside, all of you.

277
00:22:35.811 --> 00:22:37.079
Now!
Yes, sir!

278
00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:39.699
He wouldn't even listen!
I just bought a drink.

279
00:22:39.774 --> 00:22:41.659
Can you believe this?
It's not really fair.

280
00:22:41.734 --> 00:22:43.828
Come on.
You alright, son?

281
00:22:44.403 --> 00:22:46.738
You can whistle really loud,
you know that?

282
00:22:48.324 --> 00:22:50.751
You know, I couldn't believe it when
the bartender told me who you are.

283
00:22:50.826 --> 00:22:52.710
And who am I, Captain Pike?

284
00:22:52.711 --> 00:22:54.212
Your father's son.

285
00:22:57.416 --> 00:22:58.593
Can I get another one?

286
00:22:59.168 --> 00:23:01.729
For my dissertation,
I was assigned the U.S.S. Kelvin.

287
00:23:02.004 --> 00:23:03.690
Something I admired about your dad,

288
00:23:03.691 --> 00:23:05.583
he didn't believe in no-win scenarios.

289
00:23:06.258 --> 00:23:07.768
He sure learned his lesson.

290
00:23:07.943 --> 00:23:09.437
Well, it depends
on how you define winning.

291
00:23:09.512 --> 00:23:11.172
You're here, aren't you?
Thanks.

292
00:23:11.847 --> 00:23:14.900
You know, that instinct to leap
without looking, that was his nature, too.

293
00:23:14.975 --> 00:23:17.078
And in my opinion,
it's something Starfleet's lost.

294
00:23:17.353 --> 00:23:20.281
Why are you talking to me, man?
Because I looked up your file

295
00:23:20.356 --> 00:23:22.134
while you were drooling on the floor.

296
00:23:23.109 --> 00:23:25.871
Your aptitude tests are off the charts.
So what is it?

297
00:23:26.946 --> 00:23:29.749
You like being the only genius-level
repeat-offender in the Midwest?

298
00:23:29.824 --> 00:23:30.884
Maybe I love it.

299
00:23:31.659 --> 00:23:34.779
So your dad dies. You can settle
for a less-than-ordinary life.

300
00:23:35.454 --> 00:23:37.516
Or do you feel like you were meant
for something better?

301
00:23:39.291 --> 00:23:40.400
Something special?

302
00:23:43.045 --> 00:23:44.326
Enlist in Starfleet.

303
00:23:44.327 --> 00:23:45.438
Enlist?

304
00:23:47.049 --> 00:23:49.477
You guys must be way down
on your recruiting quota for the month.

305
00:23:49.552 --> 00:23:53.421
If you're half the man your father was,
Jim, Starfleet could use you.

306
00:23:54.223 --> 00:23:56.097
You can be an officer in four years.

307
00:23:56.098 --> 00:23:57.826
You can have your own ship in eight.

308
00:23:59.395 --> 00:24:02.448
You understand what the Federation is,
don't you? It's important.

309
00:24:02.523 --> 00:24:04.492
It's a peacekeeping
and humanitarian armada.

310
00:24:04.567 --> 00:24:05.483
Are we done?

311
00:24:06.884 --> 00:24:07.785
I'm done.

312
00:24:12.533 --> 00:24:13.789
Riverside Shipyard.

313
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:16.278
Shuttle for new recruits
leaves tomorrow, 0800.

314
00:24:20.541 --> 00:24:23.510
Now, your father was captain
of a starship for 12 minutes.

315
00:24:24.712 --> 00:24:26.430
He saved 800 lives,

316
00:24:27.031 --> 00:24:28.310
including your mother's.

317
00:24:28.811 --> 00:24:29.824
And yours.

318
00:24:30.718 --> 00:24:32.077
I dare you to do better.

319
00:25:57.638 --> 00:25:58.913
Nice ride, man.

320
00:26:02.851 --> 00:26:03.969
It's yours.

321
00:26:04.937 --> 00:26:06.005
Four years?

322
00:26:06.506 --> 00:26:07.705
I'll do it in three.

323
00:26:23.289 --> 00:26:24.639
At ease, gentlemen.

324
00:26:43.767 --> 00:26:45.607
Never did get that first name.

325
00:26:46.408 --> 00:26:47.408
You need a doctor.

326
00:26:47.409 --> 00:26:49.545
I told you people, I don't need a doctor,
damn it, I am a doctor!

327
00:26:49.565 --> 00:26:50.616
You need to get back to your seat.

328
00:26:50.691 --> 00:26:51.784
I had one in the bathroom
with no windows.

329
00:26:51.859 --> 00:26:53.953
You need to get back to your seat now.
I suffer from aviaphobia.

330
00:26:54.028 --> 00:26:55.138
It means fear of dying,

331
00:26:55.139 --> 00:26:56.217
in something that flies.
Sir, for your own safety,

332
00:26:56.218 --> 00:26:58.241
sit down or else I'll make
you sit down!

333
00:27:01.827 --> 00:27:02.810
Fine.

334
00:27:03.411 --> 00:27:04.287
Thank you.

335
00:27:04.997 --> 00:27:07.150
<i>This is Captain Pike.
We've been cleared for takeoff.</i>

336
00:27:08.625 --> 00:27:10.102
I may throw up on you.

337
00:27:10.377 --> 00:27:12.438
I think these things are pretty safe.

338
00:27:12.713 --> 00:27:15.140
Don't pander to me, kid.
One tiny crack in the hull

339
00:27:15.215 --> 00:27:17.318
and our blood boils in 13 seconds.

340
00:27:17.593 --> 00:27:20.379
A solar flare might crop up,
cook us in our seats.

341
00:27:20.554 --> 00:27:23.482
And wait till you're sitting pretty
with a case of Andorian shingles.

342
00:27:23.557 --> 00:27:26.702
See if you're still so relaxed
when your eyeballs are bleeding.

343
00:27:26.977 --> 00:27:30.572
Space is disease and danger
wrapped in darkness and silence.

344
00:27:30.647 --> 00:27:33.993
Well, I hate to break this to you,
but Starfleet operates in space.

345
00:27:34.568 --> 00:27:36.662
Yeah, well, I got nowhere else to go.

346
00:27:36.737 --> 00:27:39.582
The ex-wife took the whole damn planet
in the divorce.

347
00:27:40.157 --> 00:27:41.841
All I got left is my bones.

348
00:27:47.664 --> 00:27:48.764
Jim Kirk.

349
00:27:49.565 --> 00:27:51.701
McCoy. Leonard McCoy.

350
00:28:38.757 --> 00:28:39.843
Captain Nero!

351
00:28:40.444 --> 00:28:42.078
You've been requested
on the Bridge, sir.

352
00:28:42.553 --> 00:28:43.987
Ayel says it's time.

353
00:28:49.476 --> 00:28:50.288
Sir.

354
00:28:50.689 --> 00:28:52.414
We've arrived at the coordinates you calculated.

355
00:28:53.115 --> 00:28:54.223
There's nothing here.

356
00:28:54.898 --> 00:28:55.924
What are your orders?

357
00:28:56.125 --> 00:28:57.291
We wait.

358
00:28:57.943 --> 00:29:00.863
We wait for the one who allowed
our home to be destroyed,

359
00:29:01.738 --> 00:29:04.115
as we've been doing for 25 years.

360
00:29:05.409 --> 00:29:06.794
And once we've killed him?

361
00:29:07.295 --> 00:29:08.302
Kill him?

362
00:29:08.579 --> 00:29:09.938
I'm not gonna kill him.

363
00:29:10.639 --> 00:29:12.165
I'm gonna make him watch.

364
00:29:26.597 --> 00:29:27.730
Capture that ship!

365
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.250
Welcome back, Spock.

366
00:29:35.439 --> 00:29:36.707
Why are you so happy?

367
00:29:36.732 --> 00:29:37.872
I don't know what you're talking about.

368
00:29:37.873 --> 00:29:39.118
No, I don't suppose you do.

369
00:29:39.193 --> 00:29:40.593
Hello, ladies!

370
00:29:41.278 --> 00:29:42.474
I'm taking the test again.

371
00:29:42.475 --> 00:29:42.955
You gotta be kidding.

372
00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:44.730
Yeah, tomorrow morning,
and I want you there.

373
00:29:44.731 --> 00:29:46.115
But you know, I've got
better things to do

374
00:29:46.116 --> 00:29:48.210
than watch you embarrass yourself
for a third time.

375
00:29:48.385 --> 00:29:49.885
I'm a doctor, Jim. I'm busy.

376
00:29:49.886 --> 00:29:52.089
Bones, it doesn't bother you
that no one's ever passed the test?

377
00:29:52.164 --> 00:29:54.842
Jim, it's the Kobayashi Maru.
No one passes the test.

378
00:29:54.917 --> 00:29:57.311
And no one goes back for seconds,
let alone thirds.

379
00:29:58.086 --> 00:29:59.187
I gotta study.

380
00:30:00.297 --> 00:30:01.764
Study, my ass.

381
00:30:05.177 --> 00:30:07.371
Jim, I think I love you.

382
00:30:08.072 --> 00:30:09.480
That is so weird.

383
00:30:10.307 --> 00:30:11.307
Lights.

384
00:30:12.893 --> 00:30:14.345
Did you just say, that is so weird?

385
00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.413
Yeah, I did, but...
You don't love me, too?

386
00:30:16.688 --> 00:30:18.031
Oh, my roommate!

387
00:30:18.206 --> 00:30:19.324
But I thought you said
she was gone for the night.

388
00:30:19.399 --> 00:30:21.354
Obviously she's not.
Quick, get under the bed.

389
00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:22.995
Under...
Look, just get under the bed.

390
00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:23.881
Come on!

391
00:30:23.882 --> 00:30:25.309
She can't see you here.
Why not?

392
00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:27.583
Because I promised her I'd stop
bringing guys back to the room.

393
00:30:27.758 --> 00:30:28.842
Well, how many guys have you...

394
00:30:28.843 --> 00:30:29.968
Just down! Just down!

395
00:30:32.663 --> 00:30:33.663
Hey.
Hey.

396
00:30:33.789 --> 00:30:34.789
How are you?
Good.

397
00:30:35.332 --> 00:30:38.427
The strangest thing,
I was in the long-range sensor lab...

398
00:30:38.502 --> 00:30:40.104
Yeah, I thought all night.

399
00:30:40.379 --> 00:30:42.169
I was tracking solar systems and...

400
00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:44.766
I picked up an emergency transmission.

401
00:30:44.841 --> 00:30:45.511
Really?

402
00:30:45.812 --> 00:30:46.781
Yeah.

403
00:30:46.782 --> 00:30:48.611
From a Klingon prison planet.

404
00:30:49.012 --> 00:30:50.147
No.
Yeah.

405
00:30:50.422 --> 00:30:51.957
A Klingon armada was destroyed.

406
00:30:51.958 --> 00:30:52.974
Forty-seven ships.

407
00:30:53.049 --> 00:30:55.551
So you're not going back
to the lab tonight?

408
00:30:59.856 --> 00:31:01.533
Gaila, who is he?
Who's who?

409
00:31:01.608 --> 00:31:03.611
The mouth-breather
hiding under your bed.

410
00:31:03.986 --> 00:31:05.537
You could hear me breathing?

411
00:31:05.612 --> 00:31:06.318
You!

412
00:31:06.319 --> 00:31:07.206
Big day tomorrow.

413
00:31:07.381 --> 00:31:09.500
You're gonna fail.
Gaila, see you around.

414
00:31:09.501 --> 00:31:10.074
Get out.

415
00:31:10.075 --> 00:31:11.543
If I pass, will you tell me your first name?

416
00:31:11.618 --> 00:31:12.614
No! Good night.

417
00:31:12.615 --> 00:31:13.452
I think the fact

418
00:31:13.453 --> 00:31:16.205
that you picked up a transmission
is very interesting.

419
00:31:18.166 --> 00:31:21.412
We are receiving a distress signal
from the U.S.S. Kobayashi Maru.

420
00:31:21.587 --> 00:31:23.555
The ship has lost power
and is stranded.

421
00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:25.557
Starfleet Command
has ordered us to rescue them.

422
00:31:25.632 --> 00:31:28.876
Starfleet Command has ordered us
to rescue them,

423
00:31:29.886 --> 00:31:30.937
Captain.

424
00:31:32.055 --> 00:31:33.955
Two Klingon vessels
have entered the Neutral Zone

425
00:31:34.016 --> 00:31:35.201
and are locking weapons on us.

426
00:31:35.602 --> 00:31:36.669
That's ok.

427
00:31:37.144 --> 00:31:39.104
That's ok?
Yeah, don't worry about it.

428
00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:41.457
Did he say, Don't worry about it?

429
00:31:42.232 --> 00:31:44.284
Is he not taking
the simulation seriously?

430
00:31:44.359 --> 00:31:47.287
Three more Klingon warbirds decloaking
and targeting our ship.

431
00:31:47.362 --> 00:31:49.337
I don't suppose this is a problem either.

432
00:31:49.338 --> 00:31:50.332
They're firing, Captain.

433
00:31:50.407 --> 00:31:52.233
Alert Medical Bay to prepare
to receive

434
00:31:52.234 --> 00:31:54.294
all crew members
from the damaged ship.

435
00:31:54.369 --> 00:31:56.129
And how do you expect us
to rescue them

436
00:31:56.204 --> 00:31:58.824
when we're surrounded
by Klingons, Captain?

437
00:31:58.999 --> 00:32:00.299
Alert Medical.

438
00:32:02.794 --> 00:32:03.976
Our ship is being hit.

439
00:32:03.977 --> 00:32:05.347
Shields at 60%.

440
00:32:05.522 --> 00:32:06.317
I understand.

441
00:32:06.318 --> 00:32:07.516
Well, should we, I don't know...

442
00:32:07.591 --> 00:32:08.626
fire back?

443
00:32:09.301 --> 00:32:09.781
No.

444
00:32:10.582 --> 00:32:11.677
Of course not.

445
00:32:18.518 --> 00:32:19.870
What is this? What's going on?

446
00:32:24.316 --> 00:32:26.618
Arm photons.
Prepare to fire on the Klingon warbirds.

447
00:32:26.693 --> 00:32:28.770
Yes, sir.
Jim, their shields are still up.

448
00:32:28.945 --> 00:32:29.996
Are they?

449
00:32:31.907 --> 00:32:33.716
No. They're not.

450
00:32:34.117 --> 00:32:35.711
Fire on all enemy ships.

451
00:32:35.786 --> 00:32:38.263
One photon each should do.
Let's not waste ammunition.

452
00:32:38.538 --> 00:32:40.946
Target locked and acquired on all warbirds.

453
00:32:40.947 --> 00:32:41.757
Firing.

454
00:32:46.546 --> 00:32:47.742
All ships destroyed, Captain.

455
00:32:47.743 --> 00:32:48.874
Begin rescue of the stranded crew.

456
00:32:48.975 --> 00:32:52.469
So! We've managed to eliminate
all enemy ships,

457
00:32:52.844 --> 00:32:54.479
no one on board was injured,

458
00:32:54.554 --> 00:32:58.412
and the successful rescue of the Kobayashi Maru crew is...

459
00:32:59.313 --> 00:33:00.334
underway.

460
00:33:04.439 --> 00:33:06.274
How the hell did that kid
beat your test?

461
00:33:09.945 --> 00:33:11.345
I do not know.

462
00:33:12.489 --> 00:33:15.758
This session has been called
to resolve a troubling matter.

463
00:33:16.034 --> 00:33:17.760
James T. Kirk, step forward.

464
00:33:20.038 --> 00:33:22.841
Cadet Kirk, evidence has been
submitted to this council

465
00:33:22.916 --> 00:33:25.677
suggesting that you violated
the ethical code of conduct

466
00:33:25.752 --> 00:33:29.255
pursuant to Regulation 17.43
of the Starfleet code.

467
00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.943
Is there anything you care to say
before we begin, sir?

468
00:33:34.636 --> 00:33:37.731
Yes, I believe I have the right
to face my accuser directly.

469
00:33:42.519 --> 00:33:44.113
Step forward, please.

470
00:33:44.688 --> 00:33:45.903
This is Commander Spock.

471
00:33:45.904 --> 00:33:48.467
He is one of our most
distinguished graduates.

472
00:33:48.942 --> 00:33:52.503
He's programmed the Kobayashi Maru
exam for the last four years.

473
00:33:54.614 --> 00:33:55.677
Commander?

474
00:33:56.078 --> 00:33:57.768
Cadet Kirk, you somehow managed

475
00:33:57.843 --> 00:34:00.128
to install and activate a subroutine
in the programming code,

476
00:34:00.203 --> 00:34:02.380
thereby changing
the conditions of the test.

477
00:34:03.874 --> 00:34:04.795
Your point being?

478
00:34:04.796 --> 00:34:07.118
In academic vernacular, you cheated.

479
00:34:09.212 --> 00:34:11.379
Let me ask you something,

480
00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:13.207
I think we all know the answer to.

481
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:15.961
The test itself is a cheat, isn't it?

482
00:34:16.136 --> 00:34:18.063
I mean, you programmed it
to be unwinnable.

483
00:34:18.138 --> 00:34:20.732
Your argument precludes the possibility
of a no-win scenario.

484
00:34:20.807 --> 00:34:22.319
I don't believe in no-win scenarios.

485
00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:24.403
Then not only did you violate the rules,

486
00:34:24.478 --> 00:34:26.446
you also failed to understand
the principal lesson.

487
00:34:26.521 --> 00:34:27.873
Please, enlighten me.

488
00:34:28.148 --> 00:34:29.967
You of all people should know,
Cadet Kirk,

489
00:34:30.442 --> 00:34:32.110
a captain cannot cheat death.

490
00:34:35.781 --> 00:34:37.040
I of all people?

491
00:34:37.115 --> 00:34:39.435
Your father, Lieutenant George Kirk,

492
00:34:39.436 --> 00:34:40.460
assumed command of his vessel

493
00:34:40.535 --> 00:34:42.212
before being killed in action, did he not?

494
00:34:42.287 --> 00:34:44.089
I don't think you like the fact
that I beat your test.

495
00:34:44.164 --> 00:34:46.341
Furthermore, you have failed to divine
the purpose of the test.

496
00:34:46.416 --> 00:34:49.219
Enlighten me again.
The purpose is to experience fear,

497
00:34:50.796 --> 00:34:52.506
fear in the face of certain death.

498
00:34:52.881 --> 00:34:54.120
To accept that fear,

499
00:34:54.121 --> 00:34:56.560
and maintain control
of oneself and one's crew.

500
00:34:57.135 --> 00:34:59.854
This is a quality expected
in every Starfleet captain.

501
00:35:03.225 --> 00:35:04.458
Excuse me, sir.

502
00:35:11.107 --> 00:35:13.502
We've received a distress call
from Vulcan.

503
00:35:13.777 --> 00:35:16.872
With our primary fleet engaged
in the Laurentian system,

504
00:35:16.947 --> 00:35:20.452
I hereby order all cadets to report to Hangar One immediately.

505
00:35:20.453 --> 00:35:21.467
Dismissed.

506
00:35:27.791 --> 00:35:29.763
Who was that pointy-eared bastard?

507
00:35:29.764 --> 00:35:31.819
I don't know, but I like him.

508
00:35:36.174 --> 00:35:37.970
Fugeman, Regula One!

509
00:35:37.971 --> 00:35:39.436
Gerace, U.S.S. Farragut!

510
00:35:39.511 --> 00:35:41.289
McCoy, U.S.S. Enterprise!

511
00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:42.773
McGrath, U.S.S. Wolcott!

512
00:35:42.848 --> 00:35:44.448
Rader, U.S.S. Hood.

513
00:35:44.449 --> 00:35:46.392
Welcome to Starfleet and Godspeed.

514
00:35:48.645 --> 00:35:50.129
He didn't call my name.

515
00:35:51.439 --> 00:35:52.285
Commander?

516
00:35:53.386 --> 00:35:54.949
Sir, you didn't call my name.

517
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:56.186
Kirk, James T.

518
00:35:56.361 --> 00:35:57.962
Kirk, you're on academic suspension.

519
00:35:57.963 --> 00:35:59.008
That means you're grounded...

520
00:35:59.509 --> 00:36:01.049
until the Academy Board rules.

521
00:36:01.124 --> 00:36:04.384
Alright, listen up! I'm gonna read
this list one time, and one time only!

522
00:36:04.452 --> 00:36:06.574
Jim, the Board will rule in your favour.

523
00:36:07.275 --> 00:36:08.439
Most likely.

524
00:36:10.292 --> 00:36:12.176
Look, Jim, I gotta go.

525
00:36:13.477 --> 00:36:14.012
Yeah.

526
00:36:14.187 --> 00:36:15.805
Yeah, you go. Be safe.

527
00:36:23.555 --> 00:36:24.632
Excuse me.

528
00:36:24.633 --> 00:36:25.906
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

529
00:36:30.645 --> 00:36:31.696
Damn it.

530
00:36:34.566 --> 00:36:35.510
Come with me.

531
00:36:35.511 --> 00:36:37.994
U.S.S. Newton!
Uhura, U.S.S. Farragut!

532
00:36:38.069 --> 00:36:39.888
Petrovsky, U.S.S. Antares!

533
00:36:39.889 --> 00:36:41.522
Go to your stations and good luck.

534
00:36:45.243 --> 00:36:46.947
Bones, where are we going?

535
00:36:46.948 --> 00:36:48.295
You'll see.

536
00:36:50.206 --> 00:36:51.842
Commander, a word?
Yes, Lieutenant?

537
00:36:51.917 --> 00:36:53.461
Was I not one of your top students?

538
00:36:53.462 --> 00:36:54.302
Indeed you were.

539
00:36:54.377 --> 00:36:56.513
And did I not on multiple
occasions demonstrate

540
00:36:56.588 --> 00:36:59.748
an exceptional aural sensitivity
and I quote,

541
00:36:59.841 --> 00:37:02.143
an unparalleled ability
to identify sonic anomalies

542
00:37:02.218 --> 00:37:03.719
in subspace transmissions tests?

543
00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.505
Consistently, yes.

544
00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.691
And while you were well aware
that my unqualified desire

545
00:37:07.766 --> 00:37:09.363
is to serve on the U.S.S. Enterprise,

546
00:37:09.364 --> 00:37:10.819
I'm assigned to the Farragut?

547
00:37:10.994 --> 00:37:12.751
It was an attempt to...

548
00:37:12.752 --> 00:37:14.072
avoid the appearance of favouritism.

549
00:37:14.147 --> 00:37:15.949
No. I'm assigned to the Enterprise.

550
00:37:20.862 --> 00:37:22.547
Yes, I believe you are.
Thank you.

551
00:37:23.907 --> 00:37:25.159
What are you doing?

552
00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.126
I'm doing you a favour.

553
00:37:26.201 --> 00:37:27.878
I couldn't just leave you there,
looking all pathetic.

554
00:37:27.953 --> 00:37:28.705
Take a seat.

555
00:37:29.306 --> 00:37:30.306
I'm gonna give you a vaccine

556
00:37:30.307 --> 00:37:32.682
against viral infection
from Melvaran mud fleas.

557
00:37:34.283 --> 00:37:35.250
What for?

558
00:37:35.251 --> 00:37:36.263
To give you the symptoms.

559
00:37:36.264 --> 00:37:37.470
What are you talking about?

560
00:37:37.545 --> 00:37:39.706
You're gonna start to lose vision
in your left eye.

561
00:37:39.881 --> 00:37:40.999
Yeah, I already have.

562
00:37:41.174 --> 00:37:43.894
Oh, and you're gonna get
a really bad headache and a flop sweat.

563
00:37:43.969 --> 00:37:46.395
You call this a favour?
Yeah. You owe me one.

564
00:37:48.431 --> 00:37:50.082
Kirk, James T.

565
00:37:51.183 --> 00:37:53.069
He is not cleared for duty aboard the Enterprise.

566
00:37:53.144 --> 00:37:54.696
Medical code states the treatment

567
00:37:54.771 --> 00:37:56.781
and transport of a patient
is to be determined

568
00:37:56.856 --> 00:37:59.060
at the discretion of his attending physician,

569
00:37:59.061 --> 00:37:59.951
which is me.

570
00:38:00.026 --> 00:38:01.912
So I'm taking Mr Kirk aboard.

571
00:38:01.987 --> 00:38:04.414
Or would you like to explain
to Captain Pike

572
00:38:04.489 --> 00:38:06.333
why the Enterprise warped into a crisis

573
00:38:06.408 --> 00:38:08.452
without one of its senior
medical officers?

574
00:38:09.327 --> 00:38:10.368
As you were.

575
00:38:10.969 --> 00:38:12.930
As you were.
Come on.

576
00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:31.964
I might throw up on you.

577
00:38:32.365 --> 00:38:34.135
Jim, you've got to look at this.

578
00:38:35.478 --> 00:38:36.580
Jim, look.
What?

579
00:38:36.855 --> 00:38:37.855
Look.

580
00:39:34.204 --> 00:39:35.563
We need to get you changed.

581
00:39:36.564 --> 00:39:38.608
I don't feel right.
I feel like I'm leaking.

582
00:39:38.783 --> 00:39:40.593
Hell, it's that pointy-eared bastard.

583
00:39:58.228 --> 00:39:59.351
Mr Spock.

584
00:39:59.952 --> 00:40:01.031
Captain.

585
00:40:01.106 --> 00:40:02.907
Engineering reports ready for launch.

586
00:40:02.908 --> 00:40:04.117
Thank you.

587
00:40:04.292 --> 00:40:06.494
Ladies and gentlemen, the maiden
voyage of our newest flagship

588
00:40:06.569 --> 00:40:09.498
deserves more pomp and circumstance
than we can afford today.

589
00:40:10.073 --> 00:40:12.812
Her christening will just have
to be our reward for a safe return.

590
00:40:13.613 --> 00:40:14.613
Carry on.

591
00:40:14.994 --> 00:40:17.297
All decks, this is Captain Pike.
Prepare for immediate departure.

592
00:40:17.372 --> 00:40:18.573
Helm, thrusters.

593
00:40:18.748 --> 00:40:21.134
Moorings retracted, Captain.
Dock Control reports ready.

594
00:40:21.209 --> 00:40:22.341
Thrusters fired.

595
00:40:22.342 --> 00:40:23.677
Separating from spacedock.

596
00:40:33.221 --> 00:40:34.883
The fleet's cleared spacedock, Captain.

597
00:40:34.884 --> 00:40:36.283
All ships ready for warp.

598
00:40:36.558 --> 00:40:37.795
Set a course for Vulcan.

599
00:40:37.796 --> 00:40:39.122
Aye-aye, Captain.

600
00:40:39.723 --> 00:40:40.844
Course laid in.

601
00:40:41.855 --> 00:40:42.865
Maximum warp.

602
00:40:43.266 --> 00:40:44.356
Punch it.

603
00:41:01.332 --> 00:41:03.176
Lieutenant,
where is Helmsman McKenna?

604
00:41:03.251 --> 00:41:04.485
He has lungworms, sir.

605
00:41:04.786 --> 00:41:06.146
He couldn't report to his post.

606
00:41:06.421 --> 00:41:07.589
I'm Hikaru Sulu.

607
00:41:07.964 --> 00:41:09.733
And you are a pilot, right?

608
00:41:09.734 --> 00:41:11.051
Very much so, sir.

609
00:41:11.426 --> 00:41:12.351
I'm...

610
00:41:12.752 --> 00:41:14.813
I'm not sure what's wrong here.

611
00:41:14.888 --> 00:41:16.375
Is the parking brake on?

612
00:41:16.876 --> 00:41:17.556
No.

613
00:41:17.857 --> 00:41:18.858
I'll figure it out. I'm just...

614
00:41:18.933 --> 00:41:21.227
Have you disengaged
the external inertial dampener?

615
00:41:26.191 --> 00:41:27.545
Ready for warp, sir.

616
00:41:27.546 --> 00:41:28.617
Let's punch it.

617
00:41:35.867 --> 00:41:37.418
Where are we?
Medical Bay.

618
00:41:37.493 --> 00:41:39.337
This isn't worth it.
A little suffering's good for the soul.

619
00:41:39.412 --> 00:41:41.131
Hi! How are you?
Come here.

620
00:41:41.206 --> 00:41:42.894
My mouth is itchy.
Is that normal?

621
00:41:42.895 --> 00:41:44.759
Well, those symptoms won't last long.

622
00:41:44.834 --> 00:41:46.466
I'm going to give you a mild sedative.

623
00:41:46.467 --> 00:41:47.971
I wish I didn't know you.

624
00:41:48.146 --> 00:41:49.380
Don't be such an infant.

625
00:41:51.257 --> 00:41:52.741
How long is it supposed to...

626
00:41:53.468 --> 00:41:54.685
Unbelievable.

627
00:41:56.262 --> 00:41:57.655
Engines at maximum warp, Captain.

628
00:41:57.656 --> 00:41:59.885
Russian whiz kid, what's your name?
Chanko? Cherpov?

629
00:42:00.286 --> 00:42:02.610
Ensign Chekov, Pavel Andreievich, sir.

630
00:42:02.685 --> 00:42:03.650
Fine, Chekov,

631
00:42:03.651 --> 00:42:06.039
Pavel Andreievich.
Begin ship-wide mission broadcast.

632
00:42:06.314 --> 00:42:07.623
Yes, sir. Happy to.

633
00:42:08.775 --> 00:42:12.579
Ensign authorisation code
nine-five-Wictor-Wictor-two.

634
00:42:12.654 --> 00:42:14.522
<i>Authorisation not recognised.</i>

635
00:42:14.697 --> 00:42:16.916
Ensign authorisation code

636
00:42:16.991 --> 00:42:21.628
nine-five-Victor-Victor-two.

637
00:42:23.706 --> 00:42:26.266
May I have your attention, please?

638
00:42:27.001 --> 00:42:28.656
At 2200 hours,

639
00:42:28.657 --> 00:42:32.332
telemetry detected an anomaly
in the Neutral Zone.

640
00:42:32.507 --> 00:42:34.028
What appeared to be a...

641
00:42:34.029 --> 00:42:36.059
lightning storm in space.

642
00:42:36.177 --> 00:42:40.940
<i>Soon after, Starfleet received a distress
signal from the Vulcan High Command</i>

643
00:42:41.115 --> 00:42:44.718
<i>that their planet
was experiencing seismic activity.</i>

644
00:42:45.019 --> 00:42:48.823
<i>Our mission, is to assess
the condition of Vulcan,</i>

645
00:42:48.898 --> 00:42:52.092
<i>and assist in evacuations, if necessary.</i>

646
00:42:52.777 --> 00:42:54.655
<i>We should be arriving at Vulcan within</i>

647
00:42:54.956 --> 00:42:56.074
<i>three minutes.</i>

648
00:42:56.375 --> 00:42:57.631
<i>Thank you for your time.</i>

649
00:42:59.117 --> 00:43:00.215
Lightning storm.

650
00:43:01.216 --> 00:43:02.361
Jim, you're awake.

651
00:43:02.762 --> 00:43:03.970
How do you feel?

652
00:43:05.248 --> 00:43:07.041
Good God, man.
What?

653
00:43:09.752 --> 00:43:10.870
What the hell's this?

654
00:43:10.871 --> 00:43:12.580
A reaction to the vaccine, damn it!

655
00:43:12.755 --> 00:43:15.265
Nurse Chapel,
I need 50 cc's of cortisone!

656
00:43:15.383 --> 00:43:16.383
Yes, sir!

657
00:43:19.053 --> 00:43:20.119
<i>Appeared to be a...</i>

658
00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:21.856
<i>lightning storm in space.</i>

659
00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:22.453
Hey!

660
00:43:23.325 --> 00:43:24.524
We gotta stop the ship.

661
00:43:24.726 --> 00:43:27.455
Jim! I'm not kidding!
We need to keep your heart rate down!

662
00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:30.156
Computer, locate crew member Uhura.

663
00:43:30.231 --> 00:43:32.367
You know, I haven't seen a reaction
this severe since med school.

664
00:43:32.442 --> 00:43:33.781
We're flying into a trap!

665
00:43:33.782 --> 00:43:35.310
Damn it, Jim, stand still!

666
00:43:37.071 --> 00:43:38.071
Stop it!

667
00:43:47.248 --> 00:43:48.685
Uhura! Uhura.
Kirk!

668
00:43:48.986 --> 00:43:49.499
What are you doing here?

669
00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:50.970
The transmission from the Klingon prison planet.

670
00:43:50.971 --> 00:43:52.921
What exactly...
Oh, my God! What's wrong with your hands?

671
00:43:53.296 --> 00:43:53.828
It's... Look.

672
00:43:53.829 --> 00:43:56.012
Who is responsible for the Klingon attack?
What?

673
00:43:56.013 --> 00:43:57.013
And was the...

674
00:43:57.024 --> 00:43:58.024
Was the ship what?

675
00:43:58.092 --> 00:43:58.693
What's

676
00:43:58.694 --> 00:43:59.745
What's happening to my mouth?

677
00:43:59.746 --> 00:44:00.520
You got numb tongue?

678
00:44:00.595 --> 00:44:02.263
Numb tongue?
I can fix that.

679
00:44:02.638 --> 00:44:03.829
Was the ship what?

680
00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:04.607
Romulan.

681
00:44:04.682 --> 00:44:06.326
What? I...
Romulan.

682
00:44:06.601 --> 00:44:07.735
Romulan?
Yeah!

683
00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:09.070
Yes.
Yes?

684
00:44:09.145 --> 00:44:10.570
Damn it!

685
00:44:44.138 --> 00:44:45.078
Prod Nero.

686
00:44:45.079 --> 00:44:47.491
Seven Federation ships
are on their way.

687
00:44:49.644 --> 00:44:50.737
Jim!
What's going on?

688
00:44:50.812 --> 00:44:51.821
Jim, come back!
Kirk!

689
00:44:51.896 --> 00:44:52.749
Captain!
Jim!

690
00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:53.750
Captain Pike, sir.
Jim, come back here!

691
00:44:53.751 --> 00:44:54.714
We have to stop the ship!
Kirk?

692
00:44:54.815 --> 00:44:56.909
How the hell did you
get on board the Enterprise?

693
00:44:56.984 --> 00:44:58.584
Captain, this man's under the influence

694
00:44:58.585 --> 00:45:00.330
of a severe reaction to a vaccine.
Please. Bones! Bones! Bones!

695
00:45:00.405 --> 00:45:01.423
He's completely delusional,

696
00:45:01.424 --> 00:45:03.086
and I take full responsibility.
Vulcan is not experiencing

697
00:45:03.087 --> 00:45:05.200
a natural disaster, it's being
attacked by Romulans.

698
00:45:05.201 --> 00:45:05.916
Romulans?
Yes.

699
00:45:05.917 --> 00:45:08.588
Cadet Kirk, I think you've had
enough attention for one day.

700
00:45:08.663 --> 00:45:09.964
McCoy, take him back to medical.

701
00:45:10.039 --> 00:45:11.632
We'll have words later.
Aye, Captain.

702
00:45:11.633 --> 00:45:13.176
Look sir, that same anomaly
that we saw today...

703
00:45:13.251 --> 00:45:15.011
Mr Kirk is not cleared
to be aboard this vessel, Captain.

704
00:45:15.086 --> 00:45:16.429
I get it. You're a great arguer.
By Regulations...

705
00:45:16.504 --> 00:45:18.181
I'd love to do it again.
That makes him a stowaway.

706
00:45:18.256 --> 00:45:19.599
I can remove the cadet...
Try it!

707
00:45:19.674 --> 00:45:21.142
Kirk...
This cadet is trying to save the Bridge.

708
00:45:21.217 --> 00:45:23.970
By recommending a full stop mid-warp
during a rescue mission?

709
00:45:24.345 --> 00:45:25.980
It's not a rescue mission.
Listen to me, it's an attack.

710
00:45:26.055 --> 00:45:27.448
Based on what facts?

711
00:45:29.767 --> 00:45:32.653
That same anomaly, a lightning storm
in space that we saw today,

712
00:45:32.728 --> 00:45:34.597
also occurred on the day of my birth,

713
00:45:34.772 --> 00:45:37.658
before a Romulan ship
attacked the U.S.S. Kelvin.

714
00:45:37.733 --> 00:45:39.786
You know that sir,
I read your dissertation.

715
00:45:39.861 --> 00:45:42.497
That ship, which had formidable
and advanced weaponry,

716
00:45:42.572 --> 00:45:44.190
was never seen or heard from again.

717
00:45:44.365 --> 00:45:46.334
The Kelvin attack took place
on the edge of Klingon space,

718
00:45:46.409 --> 00:45:49.295
and at 2300 hours last night,
there was an attack.

719
00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:52.873
Forty-seven Klingon warbirds
destroyed by Romulans, sir,

720
00:45:52.874 --> 00:45:56.177
and it was reported that the Romulans
were in one ship, one massive ship.

721
00:45:56.252 --> 00:45:58.445
And you know
of this Klingon attack how?

722
00:46:01.382 --> 00:46:04.477
Sir, I intercepted and translated
the message myself.

723
00:46:05.052 --> 00:46:07.522
Kirk's report is accurate.
We're warping into a trap, sir.

724
00:46:07.597 --> 00:46:10.224
The Romulans are waiting for us,
I promise you that.

725
00:46:11.434 --> 00:46:13.002
The cadet's logic is sound.

726
00:46:14.145 --> 00:46:16.197
And Lieutenant Uhura is unmatched
in xenolinguistics.

727
00:46:16.272 --> 00:46:18.157
We would be wise
to accept her conclusion.

728
00:46:18.232 --> 00:46:21.202
Scan Vulcan space. Check
for any transmissions in Romulan.

729
00:46:21.377 --> 00:46:24.664
Sir, I'm not sure I can distinguish
the Romulan language from Vulcan.

730
00:46:24.739 --> 00:46:26.707
What about you?
Do you speak Romulan, Cadet...

731
00:46:26.782 --> 00:46:28.376
Uhura. All three dialects, sir.

732
00:46:28.451 --> 00:46:30.193
Uhura, relieve the lieutenant.

733
00:46:30.494 --> 00:46:31.712
Yes, sir.

734
00:46:31.787 --> 00:46:33.339
Hannity, hail the U.S.S. Truman.

735
00:46:33.414 --> 00:46:35.883
All the other ships are out of warp, sir,
and have arrived at Vulcan,

736
00:46:35.958 --> 00:46:37.919
but we seem to have lost all contact.

737
00:46:38.294 --> 00:46:40.813
Sir, I pick up no Romulan transmission,

738
00:46:41.088 --> 00:46:42.994
or transmission of any kind in the area.

739
00:46:42.995 --> 00:46:44.592
It's because they're being attacked.

740
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:51.064
Shields up. Red alert.

741
00:46:53.267 --> 00:46:55.568
Arrival at Vulcan in five seconds.

742
00:46:55.937 --> 00:46:58.872
Four, three, two...

743
00:47:00.525 --> 00:47:02.242
Emergency evasive!
On it, sir.

744
00:47:10.618 --> 00:47:12.253
Damage report!
Deflector shields are holding.

745
00:47:12.328 --> 00:47:14.654
All stations! Engineer Olson, report!

746
00:47:24.549 --> 00:47:26.309
Full reverse.
Come about starboard 90 degrees.

747
00:47:26.384 --> 00:47:28.084
Drop us down underneath them, Sulu.

748
00:47:47.154 --> 00:47:49.065
Sir, there is another Federation ship!

749
00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.334
Destroy it, too.
Fire torpedoes.

750
00:47:51.409 --> 00:47:52.627
Captain, they're locking torpedoes.

751
00:47:52.702 --> 00:47:55.461
Divert auxiliary power from port nacelles
to forward shields.

752
00:48:03.004 --> 00:48:04.512
Sulu, status report.

753
00:48:04.513 --> 00:48:05.598
Shields at 32%.

754
00:48:05.673 --> 00:48:08.100
Their weapons are powerful, sir.
We can't take another hit like that.

755
00:48:08.175 --> 00:48:09.268
Get me Starfleet Command.

756
00:48:09.343 --> 00:48:12.480
Captain, the Romulan ship has lowered
some kind of high-energy pulse device

757
00:48:12.555 --> 00:48:13.814
into the Vulcan atmosphere.

758
00:48:13.889 --> 00:48:15.441
Its signal appears to be blocking
our communications

759
00:48:15.516 --> 00:48:17.652
and transporter abilities.
All power to forward shields.

760
00:48:17.727 --> 00:48:19.102
Prepare to fire all weapons.

761
00:48:23.691 --> 00:48:24.876
Weapons ready.

762
00:48:25.377 --> 00:48:26.377
Wait!

763
00:48:26.736 --> 00:48:28.709
The hull. Magnify.

764
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:29.662
Yes, sir.

765
00:48:34.243 --> 00:48:35.769
Captain, we're being hailed.

766
00:48:37.413 --> 00:48:38.413
<i>Hello.</i>

767
00:48:40.541 --> 00:48:42.969
I'm Captain Christopher Pike.
To whom am I speaking?

768
00:48:43.544 --> 00:48:45.238
<i>Hi, Christopher. I'm Nero.</i>

769
00:48:45.713 --> 00:48:47.515
You've declared war
against the Federation.

770
00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:50.685
Withdraw, I'll agree to arrange
a conference with Romulan leadership

771
00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:53.546
at a neutral location.
I do not speak for the Empire.

772
00:48:54.221 --> 00:48:55.522
<i>We stand apart.</i>

773
00:48:57.224 --> 00:49:01.077
<i>As does your Vulcan crew member.
Isn't that right, Spock?</i>

774
00:49:03.731 --> 00:49:06.492
Pardon me, I do not believe
that you and I are acquainted.

775
00:49:06.567 --> 00:49:09.435
<i>No, we're not. Not yet.</i>

776
00:49:10.237 --> 00:49:13.190
<i>Spock, there is something
I would like you to see.</i>

777
00:49:14.992 --> 00:49:16.161
<i>Captain Pike,</i>

778
00:49:16.862 --> 00:49:18.878
<i>your transporter has been disabled.</i>

779
00:49:19.163 --> 00:49:21.317
<i>As you can see by the rest of your armada,</i>

780
00:49:21.418 --> 00:49:22.983
<i>you have no choice.</i>

781
00:49:23.501 --> 00:49:27.329
<i>You will man a shuttle and come aboard
the Narada for negotiations.</i>

782
00:49:28.255 --> 00:49:29.273
<i>That is all.</i>

783
00:49:38.766 --> 00:49:40.610
He'll kill you. You know that.
Your survival is unlikely.

784
00:49:40.685 --> 00:49:42.422
Captain, we gain nothing by diplomacy.

785
00:49:42.423 --> 00:49:43.696
Going over to that ship is a mistake.

786
00:49:43.771 --> 00:49:45.531
I, too, agree.
You should rethink your strategy.

787
00:49:45.606 --> 00:49:46.773
I understand that.

788
00:49:48.109 --> 00:49:50.970
I need officers who've been trained
in advanced hand-to-hand combat.

789
00:49:51.445 --> 00:49:52.872
I have training, sir.

790
00:49:53.973 --> 00:49:55.056
Come with me.

791
00:49:55.533 --> 00:49:57.577
Kirk, you, too. You're not
supposed to be here anyway.

792
00:49:57.952 --> 00:49:59.637
Chekov, you have the Conn.

793
00:49:59.638 --> 00:50:00.862
Aye-aye, Captain.

794
00:50:21.809 --> 00:50:23.027
Prepare the red matter.

795
00:50:25.146 --> 00:50:26.179
Yes, sir.

796
00:51:05.019 --> 00:51:07.279
Without transporters,
we can't beam off the ship,

797
00:51:07.354 --> 00:51:09.354
we can't assist Vulcan,
we can't do our job.

798
00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:12.119
Mr Kirk, Mr Sulu, Engineer Olson,

799
00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:14.360
will space-jump from the shuttle.

800
00:51:14.862 --> 00:51:17.498
You will land on that machine
they've lowered into the atmosphere

801
00:51:17.573 --> 00:51:18.712
that's scrambling our gear.

802
00:51:18.813 --> 00:51:20.610
You'll get inside, you'll disable it,

803
00:51:20.785 --> 00:51:22.128
then you'll beam back to the ship.

804
00:51:22.203 --> 00:51:25.298
Mr Spock, I'm leaving you
in command of the Enterprise.

805
00:51:25.873 --> 00:51:28.342
Once we have transport capability
and communications back up,

806
00:51:28.417 --> 00:51:31.245
you'll contact Starfleet and report
what the hell's going on here.

807
00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:33.222
And if all else fails, fall back

808
00:51:33.297 --> 00:51:35.391
and rendezvous with the fleet
in the Laurentian system.

809
00:51:35.666 --> 00:51:36.892
Kirk, I'm promoting you to first officer.

810
00:51:36.967 --> 00:51:38.252
What?
Captain?

811
00:51:38.427 --> 00:51:41.480
Please, I apologise, the complexities
of human pranks escape me.

812
00:51:41.555 --> 00:51:42.758
It's not a prank, Spock.

813
00:51:43.659 --> 00:51:44.992
And I'm not the Captain,

814
00:51:45.693 --> 00:51:46.742
you are.

815
00:51:47.228 --> 00:51:48.261
Let's go.

816
00:51:51.565 --> 00:51:53.868
Sir, after we knock out that drill,
what happens to you?

817
00:51:53.943 --> 00:51:55.728
Well, I guess you'll have to come
and get me.

818
00:51:56.403 --> 00:51:58.405
Careful with the ship, Spock,
she's brand new.

819
00:52:10.334 --> 00:52:11.586
Dr Puri, report.

820
00:52:11.961 --> 00:52:14.938
It's McCoy.
Dr Puri was on Deck 6. He's dead.

821
00:52:16.674 --> 00:52:19.919
Then you have just inherited his
responsibility as chief medical officer.

822
00:52:20.094 --> 00:52:21.678
Yeah, tell me something I don't know.

823
00:52:22.763 --> 00:52:24.764
Shuttle 37, you're clear forward!

824
00:52:25.266 --> 00:52:28.569
<i>Shuttle 89, U.S.S. Enterprise,
you are clear forward.</i>

825
00:52:28.644 --> 00:52:31.204
<i>Interval check shows
positive and steady.</i>

826
00:52:31.772 --> 00:52:33.383
You got the charges, right?
Oh, yeah.

827
00:52:33.858 --> 00:52:35.704
I can't wait to kick some Romulan ass.

828
00:52:35.705 --> 00:52:36.702
Right?

829
00:52:36.777 --> 00:52:38.553
Yeah.
Hell, yeah.

830
00:52:42.491 --> 00:52:46.219
<i>Shuttle command, we advise
you activate your shields now.</i>

831
00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:00.109
So what kind of combat training
do you have?

832
00:53:00.384 --> 00:53:01.401
Fencing.

833
00:53:05.014 --> 00:53:06.014
Pre-jump.

834
00:53:10.644 --> 00:53:14.147
<i>Shuttle commander, you are clear
from U.S.S. Enterprise airspace.</i>

835
00:53:20.571 --> 00:53:22.381
<i>Gentlemen, we're approaching
the drop zone.</i>

836
00:53:22.656 --> 00:53:25.468
<i>We have one shot
to land on that platform.</i>

837
00:53:25.743 --> 00:53:28.563
<i>They may have defences,
so pull your chute as late as possible.</i>

838
00:53:29.038 --> 00:53:29.595
<i>Three.</i>

839
00:53:30.396 --> 00:53:30.799
<i>Two.</i>

840
00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:32.198
One.

841
00:53:33.667 --> 00:53:35.928
<i>Remember, the Enterprise
won't be able to beam you back</i>

842
00:53:36.003 --> 00:53:37.603
<i>until you turn off that drill.</i>

843
00:53:39.506 --> 00:53:40.606
Good luck.

844
00:54:02.529 --> 00:54:05.124
Away team is entering
the atmosphere, sir.

845
00:54:05.199 --> 00:54:06.874
Twenty thousand metres.

846
00:54:31.225 --> 00:54:33.485
Approaching the platform
at 5,800 metres.

847
00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:34.854
<i>Kirk to Enterprise.</i>

848
00:54:35.155 --> 00:54:37.463
Distance to target, 5,000 metres.

849
00:54:40.317 --> 00:54:42.244
Forty-six hundred metres
from the platform.

850
00:54:42.319 --> 00:54:44.059
Forty-five hundred metres to target.

851
00:54:45.739 --> 00:54:47.107
Four thousand metres.

852
00:54:47.282 --> 00:54:48.399
<i>Three thousand metres.</i>

853
00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:49.501
Three thousand metres.

854
00:54:49.576 --> 00:54:51.029
Two thousand metres.

855
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.961
Pulling chute.

856
00:54:57.459 --> 00:55:01.055
Two thousand metres!
Come on, pull your chute, Olson!

857
00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:04.016
No, not yet! Not yet! 1,500 metres!

858
00:55:04.091 --> 00:55:07.686
Olson, open your chute!
Olson, pull your chute!

859
00:55:07.761 --> 00:55:09.770
One thousand metres!

860
00:55:14.852 --> 00:55:16.235
No!

861
00:55:21.942 --> 00:55:22.942
Olson!

862
00:55:24.361 --> 00:55:25.978
Olson is gone, sir!

863
00:55:45.966 --> 00:55:47.175
Kirk has landed, sir.

864
00:57:51.425 --> 00:57:52.421
Give me your hand!

865
00:57:53.222 --> 00:57:54.193
Come on.

866
00:58:00.267 --> 00:58:02.043
Olson had the charges.

867
00:58:02.978 --> 00:58:04.070
I know.

868
00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:07.650
What do we do?

869
00:58:08.051 --> 00:58:09.191
This.

870
00:58:21.455 --> 00:58:22.780
The jamming signal's gone.

871
00:58:22.781 --> 00:58:24.800
Transport abilities are reestablished.

872
00:58:24.875 --> 00:58:27.044
Transporter control is reengaged, sir.

873
00:58:27.045 --> 00:58:28.303
Chekov, run gravitational sensors.

874
00:58:28.378 --> 00:58:29.888
I want to know what
they are doing to the planet.

875
00:58:29.963 --> 00:58:30.956
Aye, Commander.

876
00:58:31.257 --> 00:58:32.531
Captain. Sorry. Captain.

877
00:58:37.471 --> 00:58:40.616
The drill's been sabotaged, sir,
but we have reached the planet's core.

878
00:58:40.891 --> 00:58:42.141
Launch the red matter.

879
00:58:57.157 --> 00:58:58.434
Kirk to Enterprise.

880
00:58:58.435 --> 00:59:00.294
They just launched something at the planet

881
00:59:00.369 --> 00:59:01.962
through the hole they just drilled.

882
00:59:02.037 --> 00:59:03.551
<i>Do you copy, Enterprise?</i>

883
00:59:03.552 --> 00:59:04.173
Yes, sir.

884
00:59:04.248 --> 00:59:05.799
Analysing data now.
Transporter is now operational.

885
00:59:05.874 --> 00:59:08.677
Captain, gravitational sensors
are off the scale.

886
00:59:08.752 --> 00:59:10.546
If my calculations are correct,

887
00:59:10.921 --> 00:59:12.832
they're creating a singularity...

888
00:59:13.533 --> 00:59:16.208
that will consume the planet.

889
00:59:18.387 --> 00:59:21.315
They're creating a black hole
at the centre of Vulcan?

890
00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:22.711
Yes, sir.

891
00:59:23.312 --> 00:59:24.758
How long does the planet have?

892
00:59:26.687 --> 00:59:28.621
Minutes, sir. Minutes.

893
00:59:29.898 --> 00:59:32.391
Alert Vulcan Command Centre
to signal a planet-wide evacuation,

894
00:59:32.392 --> 00:59:33.719
all channels, all frequencies.
Spock, wait!

895
00:59:33.794 --> 00:59:35.154
Maintain standard orbit.
Yes, sir.

896
00:59:35.529 --> 00:59:37.623
Where are you going?
To evacuate the Vulcan High Council.

897
00:59:37.698 --> 00:59:39.782
They are tasked
with protecting our cultural history.

898
00:59:39.783 --> 00:59:41.057
My parents will be among them.

899
00:59:41.058 --> 00:59:41.960
Can't you beam them out?

900
00:59:42.035 --> 00:59:44.063
It is impossible.
They will be in the katric ark.

901
00:59:44.538 --> 00:59:45.998
I must get them myself.

902
00:59:46.373 --> 00:59:47.585
Chekov, you have the Conn.

903
00:59:47.586 --> 00:59:48.641
Aye.

904
00:59:52.045 --> 00:59:53.122
<i>Kirk to Enterprise!</i>

905
00:59:53.123 --> 00:59:54.288
Beam us out of here!

906
00:59:54.289 --> 00:59:56.181
Stand by. Locking on your signal.

907
00:59:56.883 --> 00:59:58.580
Retract the drill. Let's move out.

908
00:59:58.581 --> 01:00:00.336
Yes, sir. Pull it up!

909
01:00:03.557 --> 01:00:06.235
<i>I can't lock on to you.
Don't move. Don't move!</i>

910
01:00:06.310 --> 01:00:07.960
Kirk!
Sulu!

911
01:00:15.736 --> 01:00:16.819
Sulu!

912
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:21.107
Hold on!

913
01:00:23.785 --> 01:00:25.778
I got you! Now pull my chute!

914
01:00:32.586 --> 01:00:34.035
Kirk to Enterprise!

915
01:00:34.236 --> 01:00:36.410
We're falling without a chute!

916
01:00:36.711 --> 01:00:37.966
Beam us up!

917
01:00:38.041 --> 01:00:39.726
I'm trying. I can't lock on to your signal.
<i>Beam us up!</i>

918
01:00:39.801 --> 01:00:40.920
You're moving too fast.
<i>Beam us up!</i>

919
01:00:41.595 --> 01:00:44.046
I can do that. I can do that!

920
01:00:44.598 --> 01:00:46.258
Take the Conn!
Aye, sir.

921
01:00:46.433 --> 01:00:47.526
The black hole's expanding.

922
01:00:47.601 --> 01:00:50.541
We won't reach minimum safe distance
if we don't leave immediately.

923
01:00:51.688 --> 01:00:52.982
Move, move, move, move, move!

924
01:00:53.357 --> 01:00:54.614
I can do that! I can do that!

925
01:00:54.615 --> 01:00:55.737
Move, move, move, move!

926
01:00:55.817 --> 01:00:57.736
Quick, give me manual control!
I can lock on!

927
01:00:58.111 --> 01:00:59.245
<i>Beam us up!</i>

928
01:01:01.531 --> 01:01:03.041
Enterprise, where are you?

929
01:01:03.116 --> 01:01:04.493
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

930
01:01:04.868 --> 01:01:06.890
Now, now, now! Do it now!

931
01:01:06.891 --> 01:01:08.213
Now, now, now, now!

932
01:01:08.588 --> 01:01:10.606
Ok, ok, ok! Hold on! Hold on!

933
01:01:10.607 --> 01:01:13.593
Compensating gravitational pull, and...

934
01:01:18.799 --> 01:01:19.899
Gotcha!

935
01:01:29.643 --> 01:01:30.471
Thanks.

936
01:01:31.672 --> 01:01:32.745
No problem.

937
01:01:34.731 --> 01:01:36.925
Clear the pad.
I'm beaming to the surface.

938
01:01:38.318 --> 01:01:39.587
The surface of what?

939
01:01:40.362 --> 01:01:42.555
What, are you going down there?
Are you nuts?

940
01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:44.833
Spock, you can't do that!

941
01:01:44.908 --> 01:01:46.792
Energise.
Spock!

942
01:02:25.198 --> 01:02:27.042
Spock!
The planet has only seconds left.

943
01:02:27.117 --> 01:02:28.267
We must evacuate.

944
01:02:29.244 --> 01:02:30.319
Mother, now!

945
01:02:52.893 --> 01:02:54.704
Spock to Enterprise. Get us out now.

946
01:02:54.705 --> 01:02:55.362
Locking volume.

947
01:02:55.437 --> 01:02:57.463
<i>Don't move. Stay right where you are.</i>

948
01:03:03.987 --> 01:03:08.373
Transport in five, four, three, two...

949
01:03:10.911 --> 01:03:12.738
Mother!
I'm losing her!

950
01:03:12.913 --> 01:03:14.456
I'm losing her! I'm losing her!

951
01:03:14.831 --> 01:03:17.257
No! I lost her. I lost her.

952
01:04:13.306 --> 01:04:17.118
<i>Acting Captain's Log, Stardate 2258.42.</i>

953
01:04:18.687 --> 01:04:20.754
<i>We have had no word
from Captain Pike.</i>

954
01:04:22.524 --> 01:04:23.783
<i>I have therefore classified him</i>

955
01:04:23.858 --> 01:04:26.135
<i>a hostage of the war criminal
known as Nero.</i>

956
01:04:27.195 --> 01:04:29.080
<i>Nero, who has destroyed
my home planet</i>

957
01:04:29.155 --> 01:04:31.924
<i>and most of its six billion inhabitants.</i>

958
01:04:33.493 --> 01:04:35.837
<i>While the essence of our culture
has been saved</i>

959
01:04:35.912 --> 01:04:38.098
<i>in the elders
who now reside upon this ship,</i>

960
01:04:40.667 --> 01:04:43.135
<i>I estimate no more than 10,000
have survived.</i>

961
01:04:47.173 --> 01:04:49.609
<i>I am now a member
of an endangered species.</i>

962
01:05:17.579 --> 01:05:18.708
I'm sorry.

963
01:05:21.309 --> 01:05:22.409
I'm sorry.

964
01:05:24.544 --> 01:05:25.845
I'm so sorry.

965
01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:41.902
What do you need? Tell me.

966
01:05:43.063 --> 01:05:44.063
Tell me.

967
01:05:52.822 --> 01:05:54.191
I need everyone...

968
01:05:55.992 --> 01:05:58.310
to continue performing admirably.

969
01:06:05.794 --> 01:06:06.794
Ok.

970
01:06:25.772 --> 01:06:27.682
You must have
a lot of questions for me.

971
01:06:29.109 --> 01:06:30.710
I only have one for you.

972
01:06:32.779 --> 01:06:36.725
I need the subspace frequencies
of Starfleet's border protection grids,

973
01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.485
specifically those surrounding Earth.

974
01:06:41.496 --> 01:06:42.500
Christopher,

975
01:06:43.601 --> 01:06:44.799
answer my question.

976
01:06:44.874 --> 01:06:46.968
No, you answer for the genocide
you just committed

977
01:06:47.043 --> 01:06:49.537
against a peaceful planet.
No, I prevented genocide.

978
01:06:53.633 --> 01:06:54.989
In my time,

979
01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:56.199
where I come from,

980
01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:58.230
this is a simple mining vessel.

981
01:06:58.805 --> 01:07:01.433
I chose a life of honest labour,

982
01:07:01.808 --> 01:07:05.171
to provide for myself and the wife
who was expecting my child.

983
01:07:06.146 --> 01:07:07.683
I was off planet,

984
01:07:07.684 --> 01:07:10.425
doing my job while
your Federation did nothing,

985
01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:14.029
and allowed my people to burn
while their planet broke in half.

986
01:07:14.404 --> 01:07:16.483
And Spock, he didn't help us.

987
01:07:16.484 --> 01:07:19.250
He betrayed us!
No, you're confused.

988
01:07:19.325 --> 01:07:21.503
You've been misinformed.
Romulus hasn't been destroyed.

989
01:07:21.578 --> 01:07:23.088
It's out there right now.

990
01:07:23.163 --> 01:07:25.173
You're blaming the Federation
for something that hasn't happened.

991
01:07:25.248 --> 01:07:27.133
It has happened! I watched it happen!

992
01:07:27.208 --> 01:07:29.935
I saw it happen!
Don't tell me it didn't happen!

993
01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:35.769
And when I lost her,

994
01:07:36.770 --> 01:07:38.777
I promised myself retribution.

995
01:07:39.554 --> 01:07:43.375
And for 25 years I planned my revenge
against the Federation,

996
01:07:43.850 --> 01:07:46.502
and forgot what it was like
to live a normal life.

997
01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.372
But I did not forget the pain.

998
01:07:51.191 --> 01:07:54.493
It's a pain that every surviving
Vulcan now shares.

999
01:07:56.237 --> 01:07:57.923
My purpose Christopher,

1000
01:07:58.698 --> 01:08:02.267
is to not simply avoid
the destruction of the home that I love,

1001
01:08:04.037 --> 01:08:06.434
but to create a Romulus that exists,

1002
01:08:06.735 --> 01:08:08.540
free of the Federation.

1003
01:08:11.586 --> 01:08:14.113
You see, only then
will she be truly saved.

1004
01:08:15.632 --> 01:08:19.961
That is why I will destroy
all the remaining Federation planets,

1005
01:08:20.136 --> 01:08:21.554
starting with yours.

1006
01:08:22.889 --> 01:08:24.916
Then we have nothing left to discuss.

1007
01:08:29.562 --> 01:08:32.673
You will give me the frequencies
to disable Earth's defences.

1008
01:08:35.610 --> 01:08:37.236
Centaurian slugs.

1009
01:08:38.404 --> 01:08:40.356
They latch on to your brain stem,

1010
01:08:41.783 --> 01:08:44.493
and release a toxin
that will force you to answer.

1011
01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:47.671
Frequencies, please sir.

1012
01:08:48.623 --> 01:08:50.800
Christopher Pike,
Captain, U.S.S. Enterprise...

1013
01:08:50.875 --> 01:08:51.892
As you wish.

1014
01:08:59.926 --> 01:09:01.811
Have you confirmed
that Nero is headed for Earth?

1015
01:09:01.886 --> 01:09:04.523
Their trajectory suggests
no other destination, Captain.

1016
01:09:05.098 --> 01:09:06.603
Thank you, Lieutenant.

1017
01:09:06.604 --> 01:09:07.776
Earth may be his next stop,

1018
01:09:07.851 --> 01:09:10.737
but we have to assume
every Federation planet's a target.

1019
01:09:10.812 --> 01:09:12.080
Out of the chair.

1020
01:09:12.355 --> 01:09:16.618
Well, if the Federation is a target,
why didn't they destroy us?

1021
01:09:16.693 --> 01:09:18.393
Why would they?
Why waste a weapon?

1022
01:09:18.394 --> 01:09:19.370
We obviously weren't a threat.

1023
01:09:19.445 --> 01:09:20.480
That is not it.

1024
01:09:21.155 --> 01:09:22.624
He said he wanted me
to see something,

1025
01:09:22.699 --> 01:09:24.125
the destruction of my home planet.

1026
01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:26.094
How the hell did they do that,
by the way?

1027
01:09:26.369 --> 01:09:28.412
I mean, where did the Romulans
get that kind of weaponry?

1028
01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:30.256
The engineering comprehension
necessary

1029
01:09:30.331 --> 01:09:33.502
to artificially create a black hole
may suggest an answer.

1030
01:09:33.877 --> 01:09:36.221
Such technology
could theoretically be manipulated

1031
01:09:36.296 --> 01:09:38.273
to create a tunnel through space-time.

1032
01:09:38.548 --> 01:09:40.500
Damn it man,
I'm a doctor, not a physicist.

1033
01:09:40.675 --> 01:09:42.384
Are you actually suggesting
they're from the future?

1034
01:09:42.385 --> 01:09:44.671
If you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains,

1035
01:09:44.672 --> 01:09:46.550
however improbable
must be the truth.

1036
01:09:46.951 --> 01:09:47.751
How poetic.

1037
01:09:47.752 --> 01:09:51.514
Then what would an angry
future Romulan want with Captain Pike?

1038
01:09:51.561 --> 01:09:54.113
As Captain, he does know details
of Starfleet's defences.

1039
01:09:54.188 --> 01:09:55.865
What we need to do
is catch up to that ship,

1040
01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:57.951
disable it, take it over
and get Pike back.

1041
01:09:58.026 --> 01:10:00.335
We are technologically
outmatched in every way.

1042
01:10:00.336 --> 01:10:02.372
A rescue attempt would be illogical.

1043
01:10:02.447 --> 01:10:05.250
Nero's ship would have to drop
out of warp for us to overtake them.

1044
01:10:05.325 --> 01:10:07.534
Then what about
assigning engineering crews

1045
01:10:07.535 --> 01:10:08.896
to try and boost our warp yield?

1046
01:10:08.897 --> 01:10:09.672
Remaining power and crew,

1047
01:10:09.673 --> 01:10:11.663
are being used to repair radiation
leaks on the lower decks.

1048
01:10:11.664 --> 01:10:13.609
And damage to subspace communications,
Ok! Alright! Alright!

1049
01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:15.552
Without which we cannot contact Starfleet.
There's got to be some way...

1050
01:10:15.627 --> 01:10:17.812
We must gather
with the rest of Starfleet...

1051
01:10:18.087 --> 01:10:19.848
to balance the terms
of the next engagement.

1052
01:10:19.923 --> 01:10:21.474
There won't be a next engagement.

1053
01:10:21.549 --> 01:10:23.877
By the time we've gathered,
it'll be too late.

1054
01:10:24.552 --> 01:10:26.980
But you say he's from the future,
knows what's gonna happen?

1055
01:10:27.055 --> 01:10:29.190
Then the logical thing
is to be unpredictable.

1056
01:10:29.265 --> 01:10:32.161
You're assuming that Nero knows
how events are predicted to unfold.

1057
01:10:32.936 --> 01:10:35.738
The contrary, Nero's very presence
has altered the flow of history,

1058
01:10:35.813 --> 01:10:37.407
beginning with the attack
on the U.S.S. Kelvin,

1059
01:10:37.482 --> 01:10:38.533
culminating in the events of today,

1060
01:10:38.608 --> 01:10:41.077
thereby creating
an entire new chain of incidents

1061
01:10:41.152 --> 01:10:43.613
that cannot be anticipated
by either party.

1062
01:10:43.988 --> 01:10:45.430
An alternate reality.

1063
01:10:46.449 --> 01:10:47.499
Precisely.

1064
01:10:48.284 --> 01:10:52.029
Whatever our lives might have been,
if the time continuum was disrupted,

1065
01:10:52.872 --> 01:10:54.508
our destinies have changed.

1066
01:10:55.083 --> 01:10:57.552
Mr Sulu, plot a course for the
Laurentian system, warp factor 3.

1067
01:10:57.627 --> 01:10:58.928
Spock, don't do that.

1068
01:10:59.003 --> 01:11:02.271
Running back to the rest
of the fleet for a confab,

1069
01:11:02.272 --> 01:11:03.717
is a massive waste of time.
These are the orders,

1070
01:11:03.718 --> 01:11:05.059
issued by Captain Pike
when he left the ship.

1071
01:11:05.134 --> 01:11:06.978
He also ordered us
to go back and get him.

1072
01:11:07.053 --> 01:11:08.563
Spock, you are Captain now.
You have to make...

1073
01:11:08.638 --> 01:11:10.064
I am aware of my responsibilities,
Mr Kirk.

1074
01:11:10.139 --> 01:11:12.567
Every second we waste, Nero's
getting closer to his next target.

1075
01:11:12.642 --> 01:11:14.611
That is correct, and why
I'm instructing you to accept the fact

1076
01:11:14.686 --> 01:11:17.238
that I alone am in command.
I will not allow us to go backwards...

1077
01:11:17.313 --> 01:11:18.948
Jim, he's the Captain!
Away from the problem,

1078
01:11:18.949 --> 01:11:20.308
instead of hunting Nero down!

1079
01:11:20.309 --> 01:11:21.867
Security, escort him out.

1080
01:11:29.075 --> 01:11:29.848
Hey!

1081
01:11:31.549 --> 01:11:32.544
Enough, Jim!

1082
01:11:38.126 --> 01:11:39.476
Get him off this ship.

1083
01:12:00.273 --> 01:12:01.573
Computer, where am I?

1084
01:12:01.574 --> 01:12:03.076
<i>Location, Delta Vega.</i>

1085
01:12:03.351 --> 01:12:05.286
<i>Class-M planet. Unsafe.</i>

1086
01:12:05.361 --> 01:12:08.831
<i>There is a Starfleet outpost
14 kilometres to the northwest.</i>

1087
01:12:08.906 --> 01:12:09.958
<i>Remain in your pod</i>

1088
01:12:10.033 --> 01:12:12.494
<i>until retrieved by Starfleet authorities.</i>
You gotta be kidding me.

1089
01:12:55.161 --> 01:12:58.797
Stardate 2258.42.

1090
01:12:59.165 --> 01:13:02.894
Or 44. Whatever.

1091
01:13:03.169 --> 01:13:06.848
Acting Captain Spock
has marooned me on Delta Vega,

1092
01:13:06.923 --> 01:13:11.319
in what I believe to be
a violation of Security Protocol 49.09

1093
01:13:11.594 --> 01:13:13.745
governing the treatment of prisoners
aboard a star...

1094
01:15:24.644 --> 01:15:26.444
James T. Kirk.

1095
01:15:28.648 --> 01:15:29.687
Excuse me?

1096
01:15:29.688 --> 01:15:30.882
How did you find me?

1097
01:15:32.985 --> 01:15:34.286
How do you know my name?

1098
01:15:36.030 --> 01:15:37.545
I have been,

1099
01:15:37.546 --> 01:15:39.899
and always shall be your friend.

1100
01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:44.917
Look...

1101
01:15:45.318 --> 01:15:46.461
I don't know you.

1102
01:15:46.462 --> 01:15:48.383
I am Spock.

1103
01:15:53.005 --> 01:15:54.005
Bullshit.

1104
01:15:54.674 --> 01:15:57.435
It is remarkably pleasing
to see you again, old friend.

1105
01:15:58.010 --> 01:16:00.195
Especially after the events of today.

1106
01:16:02.515 --> 01:16:04.609
Sir, I appreciate
what you did for me today,

1107
01:16:04.684 --> 01:16:06.956
but if you were Spock you'd know,

1108
01:16:06.957 --> 01:16:08.529
we're not friends. At all.

1109
01:16:08.604 --> 01:16:11.115
You hate me.
You marooned me here for mutiny.

1110
01:16:11.190 --> 01:16:12.817
Mutiny?
Yes.

1111
01:16:13.192 --> 01:16:14.493
You are not the captain?

1112
01:16:17.947 --> 01:16:19.217
No, no...

1113
01:16:20.518 --> 01:16:22.082
You're the captain.

1114
01:16:22.383 --> 01:16:23.676
Pike was taken hostage.

1115
01:16:24.937 --> 01:16:26.046
By Nero.

1116
01:16:32.211 --> 01:16:33.537
What do you know about him?

1117
01:16:34.714 --> 01:16:37.240
He is a particularly troubled Romulan.

1118
01:16:38.634 --> 01:16:40.505
Please, allow me.

1119
01:16:41.606 --> 01:16:42.783
It will be easier.

1120
01:16:43.184 --> 01:16:44.180
What are you doing?

1121
01:16:44.181 --> 01:16:47.008
Our minds, one and together.

1122
01:16:49.562 --> 01:16:51.731
One hundred twenty-nine years
from now,

1123
01:16:52.106 --> 01:16:53.714
a star will explode,

1124
01:16:53.715 --> 01:16:55.751
and threaten to destroy the galaxy.

1125
01:16:57.278 --> 01:16:58.954
<font color="#ff8000"><i>That is where I'm from Jim,</i></font>

1126
01:16:59.955 --> 01:17:01.005
<font color="#ff8000"><i>the future.</i></font>

1127
01:17:05.369 --> 01:17:07.361
<font color="#ff8000"><i>A star went supernova,</i></font>

1128
01:17:10.262 --> 01:17:11.699
<font color="#ff8000"><i>consuming everything in its path.</i></font>

1129
01:17:12.209 --> 01:17:15.270
<font color="#ff8000"><i>I promised the Romulans
that I would save their planet.</i></font>

1130
01:17:20.968 --> 01:17:22.919
<font color="#ff8000"><i>We outfitted our fastest ship.</i></font>

1131
01:17:24.638 --> 01:17:27.108
<font color="#ff8000"><i>Using red matter,
I would create a black hole</i></font>

1132
01:17:27.183 --> 01:17:29.342
<font color="#ff8000"><i>which would absorb the exploding star.</i></font>

1133
01:17:30.936 --> 01:17:32.038
<font color="#ff8000"><i>I was en route,</i></font>

1134
01:17:32.039 --> 01:17:33.972
<font color="#ff8000"><i>when the unthinkable happened.</i></font>

1135
01:17:35.232 --> 01:17:38.618
<font color="#ff8000"><i>The supernova destroyed Romulus.</i></font>

1136
01:17:44.116 --> 01:17:45.584
<font color="#ff8000"><i>I had little time.</i></font>

1137
01:17:48.454 --> 01:17:50.455
<font color="#ff8000"><i>I had to extract the red matter,</i></font>

1138
01:17:50.456 --> 01:17:52.532
<font color="#ff8000"><i>and shoot it into the supernova.</i></font>

1139
01:18:09.141 --> 01:18:11.861
<font color="#ff8000"><i>As I began my return trip,
I was intercepted.</i></font>

1140
01:18:11.936 --> 01:18:13.739
<font color="#ff8000"><i>He called himself Nero,</i></font>

1141
01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:16.155
<font color="#ff8000"><i>last of the Romulan Empire.</i></font>

1142
01:18:16.357 --> 01:18:17.805
<font color="#ff8000"><i>In my attempt to escape,</i></font>

1143
01:18:17.806 --> 01:18:20.027
<font color="#ff8000"><i>both of us were pulled into the black hole.</i></font>

1144
01:18:28.411 --> 01:18:30.076
<font color="#ff8000"><i>Nero went through first.</i></font>

1145
01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:32.236
<font color="#ff8000"><i>He was the first to arrive.</i></font>

1146
01:18:37.962 --> 01:18:42.400
<font color="#ff8000"><i>Nero and his crew spent
the next 25 years awaiting my arrival.</i></font>

1147
01:18:42.675 --> 01:18:44.459
<font color="#ff8000"><i>But what was years for Nero,</i></font>

1148
01:18:46.262 --> 01:18:48.063
<font color="#ff8000"><i>was only seconds for me.</i></font>

1149
01:18:49.265 --> 01:18:50.933
<font color="#ff8000"><i>I went through the black hole.</i></font>

1150
01:18:53.602 --> 01:18:56.179
<font color="#ff8000"><i>Nero was waiting for me.</i></font>

1151
01:19:01.819 --> 01:19:04.788
<font color="#ff8000"><i>He held me responsible
for the loss of his world.</i></font>

1152
01:19:06.824 --> 01:19:09.634
<font color="#ff8000"><i>He captured my vessel
and spared my life,</i></font>

1153
01:19:10.828 --> 01:19:12.328
<font color="#ff8000"><i>for one reason.</i></font>

1154
01:19:13.372 --> 01:19:15.807
<font color="#ff8000"><i>So that I would know his pain.</i></font>

1155
01:19:17.710 --> 01:19:19.239
<font color="#ff8000"><i>He beamed me here,</i></font>

1156
01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:21.629
<font color="#ff8000"><i>so that I could observe
his vengeance.</i></font>

1157
01:19:23.215 --> 01:19:26.267
<font color="#ff8000"><i>As he was helpless to save his planet,</i></font>

1158
01:19:26.552 --> 01:19:29.645
<font color="#ff8000"><i>I would be helpless to save mine.</i></font>

1159
01:19:32.516 --> 01:19:36.719
<font color="#ff8000"><i>Billions of lives
ost because of me, Jim.</i></font>

1160
01:19:37.313 --> 01:19:39.781
<font color="#ff8000"><i>Because I failed.</i></font>

1161
01:19:42.026 --> 01:19:43.356
Forgive me.

1162
01:19:43.557 --> 01:19:46.529
Emotional transference is
an effect of the mind-meld.

1163
01:19:53.579 --> 01:19:54.844
So you do feel.

1164
01:19:55.445 --> 01:19:56.306
Yes.

1165
01:19:57.041 --> 01:19:59.444
Going back in time,
you changed all our lives.

1166
01:20:00.419 --> 01:20:01.423
Jim,

1167
01:20:02.324 --> 01:20:03.354
we must go.

1168
01:20:04.048 --> 01:20:06.450
There is a Starfleet outpost
not far from here.

1169
01:20:07.927 --> 01:20:08.797
Wait.

1170
01:20:09.898 --> 01:20:11.388
Where you came from...

1171
01:20:14.475 --> 01:20:15.867
did I know my father?

1172
01:20:17.436 --> 01:20:18.336
Yes.

1173
01:20:19.271 --> 01:20:22.892
You often spoke of him as being
your inspiration for joining Starfleet.

1174
01:20:23.567 --> 01:20:27.078
He proudly lived to see you
become Captain of the Enterprise.

1175
01:20:27.947 --> 01:20:28.947
Captain?

1176
01:20:29.281 --> 01:20:31.950
A ship we must return you
to as soon as possible.

1177
01:20:40.751 --> 01:20:41.632
Warp 3, sir.

1178
01:20:41.633 --> 01:20:44.430
Course 1-5-1, mark 3. Laurentian system, sir.

1179
01:20:44.431 --> 01:20:45.490
Thank you, gentlemen.

1180
01:20:45.965 --> 01:20:47.139
You wanted to see me?

1181
01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:49.442
Yes, Doctor.

1182
01:20:50.761 --> 01:20:52.863
I am aware that James Kirk is
a friend of yours.

1183
01:20:53.138 --> 01:20:56.066
I recognise that supporting me
as you did must have been difficult.

1184
01:20:56.141 --> 01:20:57.435
Is that a thank-you?

1185
01:20:57.810 --> 01:21:00.171
I am simply acknowledging
your difficulties.

1186
01:21:00.646 --> 01:21:02.438
Permission to speak freely, sir.

1187
01:21:03.857 --> 01:21:04.946
I welcome it.

1188
01:21:04.947 --> 01:21:05.850
Do you?

1189
01:21:06.551 --> 01:21:07.578
Ok, then.

1190
01:21:07.653 --> 01:21:09.480
Are you out of your Vulcan mind?

1191
01:21:10.155 --> 01:21:12.625
Are you making a logical choice,
sending Kirk away?

1192
01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:14.302
Probably. But the right one?

1193
01:21:14.577 --> 01:21:16.086
You know, back home we got a saying,

1194
01:21:16.161 --> 01:21:17.588
If you're gonna ride
in the Kentucky Derby,

1195
01:21:17.663 --> 01:21:19.924
you don't leave your prize
stallion in the stable.

1196
01:21:19.999 --> 01:21:21.300
A curious metaphor, Doctor,

1197
01:21:21.375 --> 01:21:23.276
as a stallion must first be broken

1198
01:21:23.377 --> 01:21:25.063
before it can reach its potential.

1199
01:21:25.838 --> 01:21:28.140
My God, man, you could at least act
like it was a hard decision!

1200
01:21:28.215 --> 01:21:29.517
I intend to assist in the effort

1201
01:21:29.592 --> 01:21:31.869
to reestablish communication
with Starfleet.

1202
01:21:32.344 --> 01:21:35.948
However, if crew morale is better served
by my roaming the halls weeping,

1203
01:21:36.223 --> 01:21:38.925
I will gladly defer
to your medical expertise.

1204
01:21:40.436 --> 01:21:41.669
Excuse me.

1205
01:21:46.191 --> 01:21:47.992
Green-blooded hobgoblin.

1206
01:22:25.230 --> 01:22:26.239
Hello!

1207
01:23:09.108 --> 01:23:10.174
What?

1208
01:23:14.321 --> 01:23:16.206
You realise how unacceptable this is?

1209
01:23:16.281 --> 01:23:17.395
Fascinating.

1210
01:23:17.396 --> 01:23:17.708
What?

1211
01:23:17.783 --> 01:23:19.251
Ok, I'm sure you're just
doing your job,

1212
01:23:19.326 --> 01:23:21.170
but could you not have come
a wee bit sooner?

1213
01:23:21.245 --> 01:23:22.504
Six months I've been here,

1214
01:23:22.579 --> 01:23:23.246
living off...

1215
01:23:23.247 --> 01:23:25.758
Starfleet protein nibs and
the promise of a good meal!

1216
01:23:25.833 --> 01:23:28.510
And I know exactly
what's going on here, ok?

1217
01:23:28.585 --> 01:23:30.429
Punishment, isn't it?
Ongoing.

1218
01:23:30.504 --> 01:23:32.431
For something
that was clearly an accident.

1219
01:23:32.506 --> 01:23:34.604
You are Montgomery Scott.

1220
01:23:34.605 --> 01:23:35.351
You know him?

1221
01:23:35.426 --> 01:23:37.319
Aye, that's me.
You're in the right place.

1222
01:23:37.594 --> 01:23:40.694
Unless there is another hardworking,
equally starved Starfleet officer around.

1223
01:23:40.806 --> 01:23:42.842
Me.
Get aff! Shut up!

1224
01:23:43.517 --> 01:23:45.032
You don't eat anything!

1225
01:23:45.033 --> 01:23:45.944
You can eat, like, a bean,

1226
01:23:46.019 --> 01:23:46.989
and you're done.

1227
01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:49.331
I'm talking about food.
Real food.

1228
01:23:49.606 --> 01:23:52.034
But you're here now, so thank you.
Where is it?

1229
01:23:52.109 --> 01:23:54.036
You are in fact, the Mr Scott,

1230
01:23:54.111 --> 01:23:56.288
who postulated
the theory of transwarp beaming.

1231
01:23:56.363 --> 01:23:57.718
That's what I'm talking about.

1232
01:23:57.819 --> 01:23:59.608
How do you think I wound up here?

1233
01:23:59.783 --> 01:24:02.019
I had a little debate with my instructor
on the issue of...

1234
01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:05.364
relativistic physics and how
it pertains to subspace travel.

1235
01:24:05.539 --> 01:24:08.365
He seemed to think that the range of transporting something like a...

1236
01:24:08.366 --> 01:24:09.468
like a grapefruit...

1237
01:24:09.543 --> 01:24:11.095
was limited to about 100 miles.

1238
01:24:11.170 --> 01:24:13.889
I told him that I could not only
beam a grapefruit from one planet

1239
01:24:13.964 --> 01:24:15.933
to the adjacent planet
in the same system,

1240
01:24:16.008 --> 01:24:17.426
which is easy by the way,

1241
01:24:17.801 --> 01:24:19.228
I could do it with a life-form.

1242
01:24:19.303 --> 01:24:20.294
So...

1243
01:24:20.295 --> 01:24:22.481
I tested it on Admiral Archer's prize beagle.

1244
01:24:22.656 --> 01:24:24.114
I know that dog.
What happened to it?

1245
01:24:25.015 --> 01:24:26.235
I'll tell you when it reappears.

1246
01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:28.153
I don't know.
I do feel guilty about that.

1247
01:24:28.228 --> 01:24:31.056
What if I told you
that your transwarp theory was correct,

1248
01:24:31.231 --> 01:24:34.493
that it is indeed possible to beam onto
a ship that is travelling at warp speed?

1249
01:24:34.568 --> 01:24:37.121
I think if that equation had been
discovered, I'd have heard about it.

1250
01:24:37.196 --> 01:24:39.081
The reason you haven't heard of it
Mr Scott,

1251
01:24:39.156 --> 01:24:40.991
is because you haven't discovered it yet.

1252
01:24:46.914 --> 01:24:48.166
Are you from the future?

1253
01:24:48.167 --> 01:24:50.433
Yeah, he is. I'm not.

1254
01:24:51.043 --> 01:24:52.128
Well, that's brilliant.

1255
01:24:52.129 --> 01:24:53.304
Do they still have sandwiches there?

1256
01:24:53.879 --> 01:24:55.514
Well, she's a wee bit dodgy.

1257
01:24:55.589 --> 01:24:56.734
Shield emitters are...

1258
01:24:56.735 --> 01:24:59.376
totally banjaxed as well as
a few other things.

1259
01:24:59.551 --> 01:25:00.586
On youse go.

1260
01:25:00.761 --> 01:25:01.550
So...

1261
01:25:01.851 --> 01:25:03.814
the Enterprise has had
its maiden voyage, has it?

1262
01:25:03.889 --> 01:25:05.607
She is one well-endowed lady.

1263
01:25:05.682 --> 01:25:07.693
I'd like to get my hands
on her ample nacelles,

1264
01:25:07.768 --> 01:25:09.661
if you'll pardon
the engineering parlance.

1265
01:25:11.563 --> 01:25:13.940
Except, the thing is,
even if I believed you,

1266
01:25:14.141 --> 01:25:15.242
right, where you're from,

1267
01:25:15.243 --> 01:25:16.567
what I've done which...

1268
01:25:16.568 --> 01:25:17.828
I don't by the way,

1269
01:25:17.903 --> 01:25:20.372
you're still talking about
beaming aboard the Enterprise,

1270
01:25:20.447 --> 01:25:23.333
while she's travelling faster than light
without a proper receiving pad.

1271
01:25:23.408 --> 01:25:24.401
Get off there!

1272
01:25:24.402 --> 01:25:25.611
It's not a climbing frame.

1273
01:25:26.286 --> 01:25:28.162
The notion of transwarp beaming is like...

1274
01:25:28.763 --> 01:25:31.008
trying to hit a bullet with a smaller bullet

1275
01:25:31.083 --> 01:25:33.569
whilst wearing a blindfold,
riding a horse.

1276
01:25:34.044 --> 01:25:35.053
What's that?

1277
01:25:35.128 --> 01:25:38.356
Your equation
for achieving transwarp beaming.

1278
01:25:40.467 --> 01:25:41.651
Get out of it.

1279
01:25:45.931 --> 01:25:46.965
Imagine that!

1280
01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:50.160
It never occurred to me to think of space
as the thing that was moving.

1281
01:25:50.435 --> 01:25:51.770
You're coming with us, right?

1282
01:25:54.398 --> 01:25:56.566
No, Jim. That is not my destiny.

1283
01:25:57.167 --> 01:25:58.467
Your dest...

1284
01:25:59.069 --> 01:26:01.205
He... The other Spock
is not gonna believe me.

1285
01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:02.414
Only you can explain
what the hell's happened.

1286
01:26:02.415 --> 01:26:05.250
Under no circumstances
can he be made aware of my existence.

1287
01:26:05.325 --> 01:26:06.418
You must promise me this.

1288
01:26:06.493 --> 01:26:09.671
You're telling me I can't tell you
that I'm following your own orders?

1289
01:26:09.746 --> 01:26:10.776
Why not? What happens?

1290
01:26:10.777 --> 01:26:12.842
Jim, this is one rule you cannot break.

1291
01:26:13.417 --> 01:26:14.763
To stop Nero,

1292
01:26:14.764 --> 01:26:16.929
you alone must take command of your ship.

1293
01:26:17.004 --> 01:26:18.507
How? Over your dead body?

1294
01:26:18.608 --> 01:26:20.098
Preferably not.

1295
01:26:20.173 --> 01:26:23.027
However, there is
Starfleet Regulation 619.

1296
01:26:23.302 --> 01:26:24.640
619 states,

1297
01:26:25.041 --> 01:26:26.238
that any command officer,

1298
01:26:26.513 --> 01:26:29.208
who's emotionally compromised
by the mission at hand,

1299
01:26:29.683 --> 01:26:31.384
must resign said command.

1300
01:26:33.896 --> 01:26:38.075
So, you're saying that I have
to emotionally compromise you guys.

1301
01:26:38.150 --> 01:26:41.252
Jim, I just lost my planet.

1302
01:26:42.321 --> 01:26:43.539
I can tell you,

1303
01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:45.539
I am emotionally compromised.

1304
01:26:46.158 --> 01:26:48.361
What you must do is get me to show it.

1305
01:26:49.036 --> 01:26:51.880
Aye, then laddie.
Live or die. Let's get this over with.

1306
01:26:57.002 --> 01:26:57.830
No, go.

1307
01:26:58.831 --> 01:27:00.046
You cannae come with me.
Go on.

1308
01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:04.092
You know coming back in time,
changing history,

1309
01:27:05.093 --> 01:27:06.552
that's cheating.

1310
01:27:08.764 --> 01:27:10.957
A trick I learned from an old friend.

1311
01:27:19.942 --> 01:27:22.893
Live long and prosper.

1312
01:27:42.798 --> 01:27:43.956
Mr Scott!

1313
01:27:49.388 --> 01:27:50.922
Mr Scott, can you hear me?

1314
01:27:59.272 --> 01:28:00.540
Hold on a second!

1315
01:28:01.775 --> 01:28:02.817
Oh, no.

1316
01:28:06.405 --> 01:28:07.472
Don't worry...

1317
01:28:18.834 --> 01:28:20.017
No. No!

1318
01:28:39.771 --> 01:28:41.260
<i>Turbine release valve.</i>

1319
01:28:41.661 --> 01:28:42.661
<i>Activated.</i>

1320
01:28:48.947 --> 01:28:49.916
You alright?

1321
01:28:50.617 --> 01:28:51.449
You alright?

1322
01:28:53.493 --> 01:28:56.088
My head's buzzing and I'm soaked,
but otherwise I'm fine.

1323
01:28:56.263 --> 01:28:57.284
Captain Spock!

1324
01:28:57.285 --> 01:29:01.894
Detecting unauthorised access
to Water Turbine Control Board.

1325
01:29:02.169 --> 01:29:03.335
Bring up the video.

1326
01:29:07.549 --> 01:29:09.226
Security, seal the Engineering Deck.

1327
01:29:09.401 --> 01:29:11.329
We have intruders in Turbine Section 3.

1328
01:29:12.304 --> 01:29:13.571
Set phasers to stun.

1329
01:29:25.484 --> 01:29:26.984
Halt!
No, no!

1330
01:29:30.864 --> 01:29:31.973
Come with me!

1331
01:29:32.774 --> 01:29:33.799
Cupcake.

1332
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.093
Who are you?
I'm with him.

1333
01:29:43.168 --> 01:29:45.470
He's with me.
We are travelling at warp speed.

1334
01:29:45.545 --> 01:29:47.139
How did you manage
to beam aboard this ship?

1335
01:29:47.214 --> 01:29:48.473
Well, you're the genius,
you figure it out.

1336
01:29:48.548 --> 01:29:51.585
As acting captain of this vessel,
I order you to answer the question.

1337
01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:53.845
Well, I'm not telling, Acting Captain.

1338
01:29:55.347 --> 01:29:56.347
What, did...

1339
01:29:56.431 --> 01:29:59.526
That doesn't frustrate you, does it?
My lack of cooperation?

1340
01:29:59.601 --> 01:30:02.195
That doesn't make you angry.
Are you a member of Starfleet?

1341
01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:02.950
I...

1342
01:30:03.451 --> 01:30:04.556
Yes. Can I get a towel, please?

1343
01:30:04.731 --> 01:30:06.950
Under penalty of court martial,
I order you to explain to me

1344
01:30:07.025 --> 01:30:09.369
how you were able to beam
aboard this ship while moving at warp.

1345
01:30:09.444 --> 01:30:10.554
Well...
Don't answer him.

1346
01:30:11.029 --> 01:30:12.896
You will answer me.

1347
01:30:14.449 --> 01:30:15.988
I'd rather not take sides.

1348
01:30:15.989 --> 01:30:17.552
What is it with you, Spock?

1349
01:30:19.871 --> 01:30:23.318
Your planet was just destroyed,
your mother murdered and...

1350
01:30:23.819 --> 01:30:24.715
you're not even upset.

1351
01:30:24.716 --> 01:30:26.951
If you are presuming that
these experiences in any way

1352
01:30:26.952 --> 01:30:28.513
impede my ability
to command this ship,

1353
01:30:28.688 --> 01:30:29.638
you are mistaken.

1354
01:30:29.639 --> 01:30:33.210
And yet you are the one who said
fear was necessary for command.

1355
01:30:33.385 --> 01:30:36.462
I mean, did you see his ship?
Did you see what he did?

1356
01:30:37.264 --> 01:30:39.357
Yes, of course I did.
So are you afraid or aren't you?

1357
01:30:39.432 --> 01:30:41.767
I will not allow you to lecture me
about the merits of emotion.

1358
01:30:41.768 --> 01:30:43.987
Then why don't you stop me?
Step away from me, Mr Kirk.

1359
01:30:44.062 --> 01:30:45.805
What is it like not to feel anger?

1360
01:30:46.106 --> 01:30:47.298
Or heartbreak?

1361
01:30:47.983 --> 01:30:49.159
Or the need to stop at nothing

1362
01:30:49.234 --> 01:30:51.328
to avenge the death
of the woman who gave birth to you?

1363
01:30:51.403 --> 01:30:53.130
Back away from me.
You feel nothing!

1364
01:30:53.405 --> 01:30:55.673
It must not even compute for you.

1365
01:30:56.283 --> 01:30:57.708
You never loved her!

1366
01:31:22.434 --> 01:31:23.501
Spock!

1367
01:32:01.056 --> 01:32:03.600
Doctor, I am no longer, fit for duty.

1368
01:32:03.975 --> 01:32:05.569
I hereby relinquish my command,

1369
01:32:05.744 --> 01:32:08.739
based on the fact that I have been
emotionally compromised.

1370
01:32:09.814 --> 01:32:11.758
Please note the time and date
in the ship's log.

1371
01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:40.335
I like this ship!

1372
01:32:41.236 --> 01:32:42.546
You know, it's exciting!

1373
01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:46.610
Well, congratulations, Jim.

1374
01:32:46.685 --> 01:32:50.121
Now we've got no captain and
no goddamn first officer to replace him.

1375
01:32:52.065 --> 01:32:53.132
Yeah, we do.

1376
01:32:53.858 --> 01:32:54.771
What?

1377
01:32:54.772 --> 01:32:56.453
Pike made him first officer.

1378
01:32:56.528 --> 01:32:57.867
You gotta be kidding me.

1379
01:32:57.968 --> 01:32:59.513
Thanks for the support.

1380
01:33:02.534 --> 01:33:06.236
I sure hope you know
what you're doing, Captain.

1381
01:33:07.789 --> 01:33:08.848
So do I.

1382
01:33:13.878 --> 01:33:16.355
Attention, crew of the Enterprise.
This is James Kirk.

1383
01:33:17.882 --> 01:33:21.752
<i>Mr Spock has resigned commission
and advanced me to acting captain.</i>

1384
01:33:22.554 --> 01:33:25.299
<i>I know you were all expecting
to regroup with the fleet,</i>

1385
01:33:25.974 --> 01:33:28.360
<i>but I'm ordering a pursuit course
of the enemy ship to Earth.</i>

1386
01:33:28.435 --> 01:33:31.229
<i>I want all departments at battle stations
and ready in 10 minutes.</i>

1387
01:33:32.105 --> 01:33:33.703
Either we're going down...

1388
01:33:35.004 --> 01:33:36.116
or they are.

1389
01:33:37.402 --> 01:33:38.452
Kirk out.

1390
01:33:46.119 --> 01:33:47.795
Speak your mind, Spock.

1391
01:33:50.915 --> 01:33:52.524
That would be unwise.

1392
01:33:53.293 --> 01:33:54.723
What is necessary,

1393
01:33:55.224 --> 01:33:56.754
is never unwise.

1394
01:33:58.006 --> 01:34:01.158
I am as conflicted
as I once was as a child.

1395
01:34:03.178 --> 01:34:05.413
You will always be a child
of two worlds.

1396
01:34:07.766 --> 01:34:09.283
I am grateful for this.

1397
01:34:11.686 --> 01:34:12.903
And for you.

1398
01:34:15.023 --> 01:34:17.975
I feel anger for the one
who took Mother's life.

1399
01:34:19.652 --> 01:34:21.362
An anger I cannot control.

1400
01:34:26.117 --> 01:34:27.209
I believe that...

1401
01:34:30.010 --> 01:34:31.021
she would say.

1402
01:34:32.624 --> 01:34:33.908
Do not try to.

1403
01:34:35.543 --> 01:34:37.553
You asked me once,

1404
01:34:38.754 --> 01:34:40.364
why I married your mother.

1405
01:34:44.469 --> 01:34:46.578
I married her because I loved her.

1406
01:34:54.854 --> 01:34:57.889
Whatever the case, we need
to get aboard Nero's ship undetected.

1407
01:34:57.890 --> 01:35:00.118
We can't just go in there guns blazing Jim,
not with their technology.

1408
01:35:00.193 --> 01:35:02.686
I'm telling you, the math doesn't support
Captain Kirk. Captain Kirk!

1409
01:35:03.187 --> 01:35:04.581
Captain Kirk.
Yes, Mr Chekov. What is it?

1410
01:35:04.656 --> 01:35:06.791
Based on the Narada's course
from Vulcan,

1411
01:35:06.966 --> 01:35:09.928
I have projected that Nero
will travel past Saturn.

1412
01:35:10.203 --> 01:35:13.506
Like you said, we need to stay invisible
to Nero or he'll destroy us.

1413
01:35:13.581 --> 01:35:15.925
If Mr Scott can get us to warp factor 4,

1414
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.233
and if we drop out of warp behind one of Saturn's moons,

1415
01:35:19.234 --> 01:35:20.680
say, Titan.

1416
01:35:20.755 --> 01:35:23.391
The magnetic distortion
from the planet's rings,

1417
01:35:23.466 --> 01:35:25.685
will make us invisible to Nero's sensors.

1418
01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:28.146
From there, as long as
the drill is not actuated,

1419
01:35:28.221 --> 01:35:31.032
we can beam aboard the enemy ship.
Aye, that might work.

1420
01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:33.535
Wait a minute, kid.
How old are you?

1421
01:35:33.810 --> 01:35:34.810
Seventeen, sir.

1422
01:35:34.995 --> 01:35:36.529
Oh, good, he's 17.

1423
01:35:36.604 --> 01:35:37.604
Doctor.

1424
01:35:38.356 --> 01:35:39.936
Mr Chekov is correct.

1425
01:35:39.937 --> 01:35:42.035
I can confirm his telemetry.

1426
01:35:42.110 --> 01:35:44.394
If Mr Sulu is able
to manoeuvre us into position,

1427
01:35:44.395 --> 01:35:46.956
I can beam aboard Nero's ship,
steal back the black hole device

1428
01:35:47.031 --> 01:35:49.293
and if possible, bring back Captain Pike.

1429
01:35:49.868 --> 01:35:51.687
I won't allow you
to do that, Mr Spock.

1430
01:35:52.662 --> 01:35:55.315
Romulans and Vulcans
share a common ancestry.

1431
01:35:55.790 --> 01:35:57.842
Our cultural similarities
will make it easier for me

1432
01:35:57.917 --> 01:36:00.586
to access the ship's computer
to locate the device.

1433
01:36:02.422 --> 01:36:03.932
Also, my mother was human,

1434
01:36:04.507 --> 01:36:06.609
which makes Earth
the only home I have left.

1435
01:36:13.725 --> 01:36:15.060
Then I'm coming with you.

1436
01:36:15.935 --> 01:36:19.280
I would cite regulation,
but I know you will simply ignore it.

1437
01:36:21.733 --> 01:36:22.802
See?

1438
01:36:23.103 --> 01:36:24.926
We are getting to know each other.

1439
01:36:40.502 --> 01:36:41.868
Prepare the drill.

1440
01:36:57.894 --> 01:36:58.947
All stop...

1441
01:36:59.348 --> 01:37:00.416
in three.

1442
01:37:01.417 --> 01:37:02.233
Two.

1443
01:37:03.234 --> 01:37:04.234
One.

1444
01:37:08.988 --> 01:37:11.583
Give me one-quarter impulse burst
for five seconds.

1445
01:37:11.658 --> 01:37:13.543
I'll do the rest with thrusters.
On my mark.

1446
01:37:13.818 --> 01:37:14.683
Aye.

1447
01:37:15.684 --> 01:37:16.369
Fire.

1448
01:37:43.106 --> 01:37:44.079
Transporter Room.

1449
01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:45.867
<i>We are in position above Titan.</i>

1450
01:37:45.942 --> 01:37:48.702
Really? Fine job, Mr Sulu. Well done.

1451
01:37:49.571 --> 01:37:52.865
How are we, Scotty?
Unbelievably, sir, the ship is in position.

1452
01:37:56.536 --> 01:37:58.071
Whatever happens Mr Sulu,

1453
01:37:58.746 --> 01:38:00.539
if you think you have
the tactical advantage,

1454
01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:03.019
you fire on that ship,
even if we're still on board.

1455
01:38:03.020 --> 01:38:04.073
That's an order.

1456
01:38:06.170 --> 01:38:06.870
Yes, sir.

1457
01:38:06.921 --> 01:38:10.075
<i>Otherwise we'll contact the Enterprise
when we're ready to be beamed back.</i>

1458
01:38:11.050 --> 01:38:12.050
Good luck.

1459
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:26.442
I will be back.

1460
01:38:26.943 --> 01:38:28.208
You better be.

1461
01:38:29.902 --> 01:38:31.620
I'll be monitoring your frequency.

1462
01:38:32.121 --> 01:38:33.404
Thank you, Nyota.

1463
01:38:49.714 --> 01:38:52.217
So her first name's Nyota?
I have no comment on the matter.

1464
01:38:52.592 --> 01:38:54.477
Okey-dokey, then,
if there is any common sense

1465
01:38:54.552 --> 01:38:55.853
in the design of the enemy ship,

1466
01:38:55.928 --> 01:38:57.928
I should be putting you
somewhere in the Cargo Bay.

1467
01:38:57.972 --> 01:39:00.182
Shouldn't be a soul in sight.
Energise.

1468
01:39:43.976 --> 01:39:46.453
<i>Captain, we have Starfleet officers
aboard the ship.</i>

1469
01:39:46.729 --> 01:39:48.059
<i>One of them is Vulcan.</i>

1470
01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:49.060
No.

1471
01:39:53.611 --> 01:39:54.695
Ayel!

1472
01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:10.569
I'll cover you.

1473
01:40:11.129 --> 01:40:12.946
Are you certain?
Yeah, I got you.

1474
01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:34.043
Do you know where it is?

1475
01:40:35.244 --> 01:40:36.394
The black hole device.

1476
01:40:38.072 --> 01:40:39.440
And Captain Pike.

1477
01:41:02.430 --> 01:41:03.430
Move!

1478
01:41:04.182 --> 01:41:05.966
They have activated the drill.

1479
01:41:07.435 --> 01:41:09.112
Communication and transport
are inoperative.

1480
01:41:09.187 --> 01:41:10.655
Sulu, please tell me you have them.

1481
01:41:10.730 --> 01:41:12.407
Otherwise we won't be able
to beam them back.

1482
01:41:12.482 --> 01:41:14.165
Kirk and Spock are on their own now.

1483
01:41:33.294 --> 01:41:34.679
I foresee a complication.

1484
01:41:34.754 --> 01:41:37.390
The design of their ship is far
more advanced than I had anticipated.

1485
01:41:37.465 --> 01:41:40.376
<i>Voice print and face recognition
analysis enabled.</i>

1486
01:41:40.551 --> 01:41:42.687
<i>Welcome back, Ambassador Spock.</i>

1487
01:41:42.762 --> 01:41:44.004
That's weird.

1488
01:41:45.389 --> 01:41:48.317
Computer, what is
your manufacturing origin?

1489
01:41:48.392 --> 01:41:53.113
<i>Stardate 2387. Commissioned
by the Vulcan Science Academy.</i>

1490
01:41:55.733 --> 01:41:58.327
It appears that you have been keeping
important information from me.

1491
01:41:58.402 --> 01:41:59.996
You're gonna be able
to fly this thing, right?

1492
01:42:00.571 --> 01:42:02.389
Something tells me I already have.

1493
01:42:03.574 --> 01:42:04.265
Good luck.

1494
01:42:04.966 --> 01:42:05.658
Jim.

1495
01:42:06.327 --> 01:42:09.946
The statistical likelihood that our plan
will succeed is less than 4.3%.

1496
01:42:10.047 --> 01:42:11.941
It'll work.
In the event that I do not return,

1497
01:42:12.016 --> 01:42:13.426
please tell Lieutenant Uhura...
Spock!

1498
01:42:14.001 --> 01:42:15.052
It'll work.

1499
01:42:25.513 --> 01:42:26.513
Fascinating.

1500
01:42:35.606 --> 01:42:37.849
<i>Start-up sequence initiated.</i>

1501
01:43:21.903 --> 01:43:24.323
Nero, order your men to disable the drill
or I will...

1502
01:43:34.665 --> 01:43:36.085
I know your face...

1503
01:43:36.786 --> 01:43:37.967
from Earth's history.

1504
01:44:22.713 --> 01:44:25.609
James T. Kirk was considered
to be a great man.

1505
01:44:26.384 --> 01:44:28.728
He went on to captain
the U.S.S. Enterprise.

1506
01:44:28.803 --> 01:44:30.336
But that was another life.

1507
01:44:30.972 --> 01:44:33.840
A life I will deprive you of,
just like I did your father.

1508
01:45:06.632 --> 01:45:07.636
<i>Captain Nero.</i>

1509
01:45:07.637 --> 01:45:10.827
<i>The Vulcan ship has been taken.
The drill has been destroyed.</i>

1510
01:45:11.303 --> 01:45:12.240
Spock!

1511
01:45:14.241 --> 01:45:15.641
Spock!

1512
01:45:33.284 --> 01:45:34.375
Open a channel.

1513
01:45:34.376 --> 01:45:35.001
Yes, sir!

1514
01:45:36.495 --> 01:45:39.590
Spock. I knew I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

1515
01:45:39.865 --> 01:45:41.801
I hereby confiscate
this illegally obtained ship

1516
01:45:41.876 --> 01:45:43.135
and order you to surrender your vessel.

1517
01:45:43.210 --> 01:45:45.221
<i>No terms. No deals.</i>
That ship, take it out.

1518
01:45:45.296 --> 01:45:46.629
Sir, if you ignite the red matter,

1519
01:45:46.630 --> 01:45:48.650
you'll destroy...
I want Spock dead now!

1520
01:46:04.023 --> 01:46:05.908
He went to warp, sir.
Go after him!

1521
01:46:05.983 --> 01:46:06.992
Yes, sir!

1522
01:46:37.348 --> 01:46:39.991
Your species is even weaker
than I expected.

1523
01:46:41.769 --> 01:46:43.946
I can't...
You can't what?

1524
01:46:44.021 --> 01:46:45.463
You can't even speak.

1525
01:46:48.192 --> 01:46:49.154
What?

1526
01:46:49.755 --> 01:46:51.402
I got your gun.

1527
01:47:17.596 --> 01:47:19.021
What's he doing?

1528
01:47:19.140 --> 01:47:22.358
<i>Ambassador Spock,
you are on a collision course.</i>

1529
01:47:22.810 --> 01:47:24.193
Fire everything!

1530
01:47:31.235 --> 01:47:32.547
<i>Incoming missiles.</i>

1531
01:47:32.548 --> 01:47:35.498
<i>If the ship is hit, the red
matter will be ignited.</i>

1532
01:47:35.573 --> 01:47:36.748
Understood.

1533
01:47:43.247 --> 01:47:44.989
Captain, I've picked up another ship!

1534
01:48:06.604 --> 01:48:07.838
What are you doing here?

1535
01:48:07.839 --> 01:48:08.972
Just following orders.

1536
01:48:29.627 --> 01:48:31.010
Enterprise, now!

1537
01:48:54.151 --> 01:48:55.660
Nice timing, Scotty!

1538
01:48:56.820 --> 01:49:00.449
I've never beamed three people
from two targets onto one pad before!

1539
01:49:00.824 --> 01:49:01.394
Jim!

1540
01:49:01.695 --> 01:49:02.651
Bones!

1541
01:49:02.826 --> 01:49:03.910
I got him.

1542
01:49:06.580 --> 01:49:07.864
That was pretty good!

1543
01:49:08.999 --> 01:49:12.161
Captain, the enemy ship is losing
power! Their shields are down, sir.

1544
01:49:12.336 --> 01:49:14.011
Hail them now.
Aye.

1545
01:49:48.872 --> 01:49:51.549
This is Captain James T. Kirk
of the U.S.S. Enterprise.

1546
01:49:52.209 --> 01:49:53.452
Your ship is compromised.

1547
01:49:53.627 --> 01:49:56.138
Too close to the singularity
to survive without assistance,

1548
01:49:56.213 --> 01:49:58.047
which we are willing to provide.

1549
01:50:01.385 --> 01:50:02.670
Captain, what are you doing?

1550
01:50:02.971 --> 01:50:05.648
Showing them compassion may be
the only way to earn peace with Romulus.

1551
01:50:05.723 --> 01:50:06.897
It's logic, Spock.

1552
01:50:07.098 --> 01:50:08.634
I thought you'd like that.

1553
01:50:08.809 --> 01:50:09.819
No, not really.

1554
01:50:10.420 --> 01:50:11.428
Not this time.

1555
01:50:11.603 --> 01:50:15.958
<i>I would rather suffer the end
of Romulus a thousand times.</i>

1556
01:50:16.233 --> 01:50:20.496
<i>I would rather die in agony
than accept assistance from you.</i>

1557
01:50:20.571 --> 01:50:21.571
You got it.

1558
01:50:22.406 --> 01:50:24.563
Arm phasers.
Fire everything we've got.

1559
01:50:24.664 --> 01:50:25.664
Yes, sir.

1560
01:51:10.454 --> 01:51:12.099
Sulu, let's go home.

1561
01:51:12.100 --> 01:51:12.989
Yes, sir!

1562
01:51:24.134 --> 01:51:26.145
Why aren't we at warp?
We are, sir.

1563
01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:28.439
Kirk to Engineering.
Get us out of here, Scotty.

1564
01:51:28.514 --> 01:51:30.047
You bet your ass, Captain!

1565
01:51:33.519 --> 01:51:35.571
Captain, we're caught in the gravity well!
It's got us!

1566
01:51:35.646 --> 01:51:37.500
Go to maximum warp! Push it!

1567
01:51:37.501 --> 01:51:39.448
I'm giving her all she's got, Captain!

1568
01:51:48.492 --> 01:51:49.960
All she's got isn't good enough!

1569
01:51:50.035 --> 01:51:51.919
<i>What else you got?</i>

1570
01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:53.422
Ok, if we eject the core and detonate,

1571
01:51:53.497 --> 01:51:54.798
the blast could be enough
to push us away.

1572
01:51:54.873 --> 01:51:56.533
I cannae promise anything, though!

1573
01:51:59.670 --> 01:52:01.370
Do it, do it, do it!

1574
01:52:02.339 --> 01:52:04.473
Clear the area! Go!
Yes, sir!

1575
01:53:31.762 --> 01:53:32.762
Father!

1576
01:53:41.647 --> 01:53:43.439
I am not our father.

1577
01:53:51.114 --> 01:53:52.959
There are so few Vulcans left.

1578
01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:55.985
We cannot afford to ignore each other.

1579
01:53:58.872 --> 01:54:00.048
Then why did you send Kirk aboard

1580
01:54:00.123 --> 01:54:02.050
when you alone
could have explained the truth?

1581
01:54:02.125 --> 01:54:04.133
Because you needed each other.

1582
01:54:04.134 --> 01:54:05.596
I could not deprive you

1583
01:54:05.671 --> 01:54:08.390
of the revelation of all
that you could accomplish together,

1584
01:54:08.465 --> 01:54:09.815
of a friendship,

1585
01:54:09.816 --> 01:54:11.413
that will define you both,

1586
01:54:12.014 --> 01:54:13.936
in ways you cannot yet realise.

1587
01:54:15.514 --> 01:54:17.549
How did you persuade him
to keep your secret?

1588
01:54:17.724 --> 01:54:21.111
He inferred that universe-ending
paradoxes would ensue

1589
01:54:21.186 --> 01:54:23.546
should he break his promise.
You lied.

1590
01:54:25.023 --> 01:54:25.849
I...

1591
01:54:26.250 --> 01:54:27.491
I implied.

1592
01:54:27.693 --> 01:54:29.935
A gamble.
An act of faith.

1593
01:54:30.821 --> 01:54:33.782
One I hope that you'll repeat
in the future in Starfleet.

1594
01:54:34.157 --> 01:54:35.751
In the face of extinction,
it is only logical

1595
01:54:35.826 --> 01:54:38.587
I resign my Starfleet commission
and help rebuild our race.

1596
01:54:38.662 --> 01:54:41.013
And yet, you can be
in two places at once.

1597
01:54:42.207 --> 01:54:44.601
I urge you to remain in Starfleet.

1598
01:54:45.377 --> 01:54:49.165
I have already located a suitable planet
on which to establish a Vulcan colony.

1599
01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:53.651
Spock, in this case,
do yourself a favour.

1600
01:54:55.053 --> 01:54:56.429
Put aside logic.

1601
01:54:56.930 --> 01:54:58.547
Do what feels right.

1602
01:55:04.187 --> 01:55:07.950
Since my customary farewell
would appear oddly self-serving,

1603
01:55:08.025 --> 01:55:09.133
I shall simply say...

1604
01:55:10.277 --> 01:55:11.436
good luck.

1605
01:55:22.623 --> 01:55:26.375
This assembly calls Captain
James Tiberius Kirk.

1606
01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:30.389
Your inspirational valour and
supreme dedication to your comrades

1607
01:55:30.464 --> 01:55:33.041
is in keeping with
the highest traditions of service,

1608
01:55:33.216 --> 01:55:38.054
and reflect utmost credit to yourself,
your crew and the Federation.

1609
01:55:39.097 --> 01:55:42.358
It is my honour to award you
with this commendation.

1610
01:55:46.730 --> 01:55:48.740
By Starfleet Order 28455,

1611
01:55:48.815 --> 01:55:51.574
you are hereby directed to report to Admiral Pike,

1612
01:55:51.575 --> 01:55:52.911
U.S.S. Enterprise,

1613
01:55:52.986 --> 01:55:55.037
for duty as his relief.

1614
01:56:03.622 --> 01:56:04.731
I relieve you, sir.

1615
01:56:05.749 --> 01:56:07.183
I am relieved.

1616
01:56:09.419 --> 01:56:10.381
Thank you, sir.

1617
01:56:10.382 --> 01:56:12.062
Congratulations, Captain.

1618
01:56:13.924 --> 01:56:15.358
Your father would be proud.

1619
01:56:45.205 --> 01:56:46.872
Thrusters on full.

1620
01:56:47.457 --> 01:56:50.302
Manoeuvring thrusters and
impulse engines at your command, sir.

1621
01:56:50.377 --> 01:56:53.055
Weapons systems and shields
on standby.

1622
01:56:53.130 --> 01:56:55.915
Dock Control reports ready, Captain.

1623
01:57:00.220 --> 01:57:01.162
Bones!

1624
01:57:02.163 --> 01:57:03.255
Buckle up.

1625
01:57:07.644 --> 01:57:08.192
Scotty,

1626
01:57:08.293 --> 01:57:09.112
<i>how we doing?</i>

1627
01:57:09.187 --> 01:57:11.656
Dilithium chamber's
at maximum, Captain.

1628
01:57:12.899 --> 01:57:14.116
Get down!

1629
01:57:16.319 --> 01:57:17.407
Mr Sulu,

1630
01:57:17.708 --> 01:57:19.521
prepare to engage thrusters.

1631
01:57:22.325 --> 01:57:24.002
Permission to come aboard, Captain.

1632
01:57:25.078 --> 01:57:26.329
Permission granted.

1633
01:57:27.581 --> 01:57:29.675
As you have yet
to select a first officer,

1634
01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:32.335
respectfully I would like to submit
my candidacy.

1635
01:57:33.378 --> 01:57:35.939
Should you desire,
I can provide character references.

1636
01:57:37.257 --> 01:57:38.750
It would be my honour, Commander.

1637
01:57:43.221 --> 01:57:44.881
Manoeuvring thrusters, Mr Sulu.

1638
01:57:47.392 --> 01:57:49.019
Thrusters on standby.

1639
01:57:49.394 --> 01:57:51.787
Take us out.
Aye-aye, Captain.
