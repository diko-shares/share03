Quickly established an effectiveness

Use your brain.

17
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.673
Proceeded to improve skill base
with courses in advanced driving

18
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.556

30
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.950
It can get awfully hairy out there.

31
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.150
I'm surprised you weren't snapped up
sooner for a nice desk job. That's what I did.

32
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.436
I prefer to think my office is
out on the street.

33
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.999
Indeed, you do.

34
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.558
Your arrest record is 400% higher
than any other officer.

35
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.077
Which is why it's high time
that such skills were put to better use.

-In Sandford, Gloucestershire.

Sergeant, I kind of like it here.

45
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.717

to transfer to the country.

-In 20 years or so, yes.
-Well done, you.

Hang on, I don't remember telling you that.

48
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.591
Yes, you did. You said,

49
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.559
"I'd love to settle down
in the country sometime, Janine."

50
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.473
I'd like to talk to the Inspector.

51
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.437
You can speak to the Inspector,
but I can promise you

52
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.353
he will tell you
exactly the same thing as I have.

53
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.311
-Hello, Nicholas. How's the hand?
-It's still a bit stiff.

We're no longer together, sir.

57

-He's staying at the Section House, sir.

58
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.353
-With the recruits?
-Yes, he's living out of cardboard boxes.

59

-You want to take this higher?
-Yes, yes, I do.

You want me to bother
the Chief Inspector with this?

68
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.275
Yes.

69
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.273

to come all the way down here?

letting the side down.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.833
-Mr Skinner...
-Is everything all right?

507
00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:39.750
Well, sir, Mr Skinner feels it would
be better not to prosecute an individual

508
00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.831
that has committed a blatant offence.

509
00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.319
Leave this with me.

510
00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:46.438
I'll make sure everyone gets
their just deserts.

511
00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.318
Oh, no!

512
00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.474
Twenty-seven.

513
00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.951
-DANNY: Have you ever seen Point Break?
-No.

514
00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.270
Amazing bit in Point Break
where they jump over fences.

515
00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.192
Is there now? Twenty-nine.

516
00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.113
Patrick Swayze's just robbed this bank
and Keanu Reeves is chasing him

517
00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.999
through people's gardens,
and he goes to shoot Swayze but he can't,

518
00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:07.195
'cause he loves him so much,

519
00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.351
and he's firing his gun up in the air,
he's like...

520
00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.794
Forty.

521
00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.598
Have you ever fired your gun up
in the air and gone...

522
00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.877
No, I have not ever fired my gun
up in the air and gone...

523
00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.359
Thirty.

524
00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:20.990
Sorry, I... I just...
I just feel like I'm missing out sometimes.

525
00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.959
-I wanna do what you do.
-You do, do what I do.

526
00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.758
What on earth
do you think you're missing out on?

527
00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.151
Gun fights. Car chases.
Proper action and shit.

528
00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:32.517
Police work is not about
proper action or shit.

529
00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.634
Twenty-nine.

530
00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:35.994
If you had paid attention to me in school,

531
00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:39.118
you'd understand that it's not all about
gun fights and car chases.

532
00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:41.749
Fire up the roof.

533
00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.838
That was brilliant.

534
00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.829
Was I going a tad fast, Officer?

535
00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.311
Yes, you were, Mr Blower.

536
00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:58.518
Well, now, you see,
we are staging a homage

537
00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:02.514
to William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet
and I'm a little late for the dress rehearsal.

538
00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.513
I'm playing the eponymous hero, you see.

539
00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:07.313
Romeo not Juliet.

540
00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.200
-What are you writing?
-Everything you're saying.

541
00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.634
I might need to refer to it later.

542
00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:17.634
Now, Officer, I am a respected solicitor
so there's no need to...

543
00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.194
Just stop writing, will you?

544
00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:24.275
Look, I'm merely trying to explain
why I might have exceeded the speed limit.

545
00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.034
You're playing the male lead
in a homage to William Shakespeare's

546
00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.919
Romeo and Juliet
and you're late for the dress rehearsal.

547
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.753
You think this is sufficient reason
to travel at 48 in a 30 zone?

548
00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.592
-Well, I...
-To flout speed limits

549
00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:38.560
-specifically put in place to save lives.
-Just, look, this is preposterous.

550
00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.270
-"Preposterous.”
-Look, just stop writing!

551
00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.431
"Stop writing."

552
00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:49.960
Look, you're right, I apologise.

553
00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.550
-See what I did there?
-You hypnotised him.

554
00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:54.994
No, I used this.

555
00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.469
This is the most important piece
of equipment you will ever own.

556
00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.313
This notebook has saved my skin
more times than I care to mention.

557
00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.879
You should think
about using yours more often.

558
00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.871
-I do use mine.
-Show me.

559
00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:12.072
-That's just extraordinary.
-You should see the one on the other side.

560
00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:20.759
-What are you up to tonight?
- have to water my Peace Lily.

561
00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:22.319
Thought you might wanna do something.

562
00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.392
-What exactly were you thinking?
-Don't know. Pub?

563
00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:28.598
I don't think that's a good idea. Do you?

564
00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.914
You two.

565
00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:37.278
A Mr Blower left you tickets
for Romeo and Juliet tonight.

566
00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.680
Said it was by way of an apology.

567
00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.239
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

568
00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:44.520
Well, we can't accept gifts from somebody
we've officially rebuked. So...

569
00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.109
Yeah.

570
00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:48.913
Nicholas. Glad I caught you.

571
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.595
Wondered if you wouldn't mind
representing us at the am drams tonight.

572
00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:55.479
-Yes, sir, of course.
-And there's a spare for Danny, too.

573
00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:58.837
Yeah! Hey, come on, it might be fun.

574

E

575
00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.136
A dateless bargain to engrossing death.

576
00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.800
Here's to my love.

578
00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:16.515

Poison? I'll kiss thy lips.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:28.358
Happily some poison
doth yet hang on them.

582
00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:36.835
Bang!

(ALL SINGING)

584
00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:58.038
Sergeant Angel, hi-hi.
Quick word for the Sandford Citizen.

585
00:34:58.680 --> 00:34:59.909
It was very enjoyable.

586
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.150
-"Cop Enjoys Watching Young Lovers"?
- I don't think so.

587
00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.799
"Local Bobby Gives Thumbs Up
To Teen Suicide"?

588
00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.393
That's just grossly inappropriate.

589
00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:09.317
You will try and spell his name
correctly this time, won't you, Timothy?

590
00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.755
Absolute tosh, wasn't it?

591
00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:15.954
And annoyingly, the understudies
are actually professional actors.

592
00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.475
Greg over there was an extra in Straw Dogs

593
00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.358
and Sheree portrayed a cadaver
in Prime Suspect.

594
00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.511
Sergeant Angel, you came?

595
00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.831
So thrilled you accepted my invitation.

596
00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:28.753
Well, our Inspector
requested we attend. So...

597
00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:33.437
Yeah, we can't accept gifts from
someone we've officially rebuked so...

598
00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:34.794
Jog on.

599
00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:38.512
Congratulations to you and to Mrs Blower.

600
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:45.277
Oh, this is not my wife.
This is Miss Draper. My leading lady.

601
00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:49.872
Eve works in the local council, Sergeant.
Quite the lady in the know.

602
00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:52.793
-I am not.
-Nonsense.

603
00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:58.353
I'm sure if we bashed your head in, all sorts
of secrets would come tumbling out.

604
00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:04.559
Romeo, Romeo, a pint of bitter for Romeo?

605
00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.438
Thank you very much for coming, George.
Excuse us.

606
00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.557
A pleasure, my liege.

607
00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.917
-Eve's nice, ain't she?
-She certainly has a distinctive laugh.

608
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.277
She was in my year at school.
Always had a thing for her.

609
00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.917
She clearly has a thing for older men.

610
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.196
What, with Martin Blower? No way!

611
00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.240
We just sat through three hours
of so-called acting, Constable,

612
00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.960
their kiss was
the only convincing moment in it.

613
00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.633
Hey, now you come to mention it,

614
00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:31.234
I too have reason to believe
she favours the older gent.

615
00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.390
Really? How so?

616
00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:35.438
Marcus Carter's big brother said
he'd fingered her up the duck pond.

617

Oh, Officers.

618
00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:43.950
Again let me extend
my sincere apologies for earlier.

619
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.271
That's quite all right, Mr Blower. Drive safe.

You know that's the bloke
we done for speeding earlier.

00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:00.559
Yeah. Hopefully,
that's the last we'll see of him.

We haven't got long.

-Decaffeinated?

Little Brian Libby found them,
out on his paper round.

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:53.559
Oh, he'll be having nightmares for a while.

635
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.755
Must have hit the sign at some speed.
Took the whole top off.

636
00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:00.753
-I've had my top off in this lay-by.
-Tits.

637
00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:07.109
Most likely lost control,
left the road there and then ended up here.

638
00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:12.873
So, what do we reckon?

639
00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.039
Sergeant Angel?

640
00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:18.319
Well, we should get a proper cordon off,
screen the remains from public view.

641
00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.038
Close down the road
until the ambulance crew arrives,

642
00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:23.317
whereupon we should open
a single lane of traffic and ease congestion.

643
00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.114
Very good.

644
00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:26.795
What he said.

645
00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.997
-What happened, Danny?
-Car accident.

646
00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:35.753
Nasty way to go.

647
00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.471
Constable, official vocab guidelines state

648
00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:41.518
we no longer refer to these incidents
as "accidents," they're now "collisions."

649
00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:42.635
Right.

650
00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:48.591
"For never was there a story of more woe.
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo."

-Excuse me?
-Martin and Eve. Such a tragedy.

652
00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.993
Mr Skinner, do you mind telling me

653
00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.196
how you know the identity
of the persons involved?

654
00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:59.591
You know how it is. News travels fast.

-What happened, Danny?
-Traffic collision.

657
00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.672
Hey, why can't we say "accident" again?

658
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.115
Because "accident” implies
there's nobody to blame.

Put a sock in it, town mouse.

a small town, fuck off up the model village.

things aren't always as simple as they look.

check out a few of Martin Blower's clients?

damn near most of the village.

Did you want us to go through
the whole phone book?

668
00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.354
Yeah, or put a call into Aaron A. Aaronson,
shall we?

669
00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.714
Please, don't be childish.

670
00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.029
At least consider interviewing the widow.

671
00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:43.111
Martin Blower was clearly having
an affair with Eve Draper.

672
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.477
Oh, and how did you establish that?

673
00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:49.200
'Cause we sat through three hours
of so-called acting last night,

674
00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:51.590
and the kiss was
the only convincing moment in it.

675
00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.671
All right, pipe down, big one.

676
00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.195
Here, what else you got,
Crockett and Tubby?

677
00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:58.590
-Skid marks.
-Now who's being childish?

678
00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.432
There were no skid marks at the scene.

679
00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:03.353
Doesn't it seem a little strange that
Martin Blower would lose control of his car

680
00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.272
and not think to apply the brakes?

681
00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:07.109
If there were no skid marks it follows

682
00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.955
that for 300 yards both driver and passenger
did nothing to prevent their fate.

683
00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.951
You don't have to be a detective
to work that out!

684
00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.155
Yeah.

685
00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:17.198
-Are you causing trouble?
-Yes, they are.

686
00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:20.352
Well, a spot of bother up at Ellroy Farm.

687
00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.796
Old Arthur Webley's been clipping
hedgerows that don't belong to him.

688
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.518
-Yes, sir?
-That's it.

693
00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:44.955

Look, I appreciate your position,
Mr Webley,

701
00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:01.998
but you can't go around chopping down
other people's hedges without permission.

"Yes, I suppose.”

703
00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:06.390
Thank you.

704
00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.554
All right.

705
00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:12.879
Mr Webley,
I trust you have a licence for that firearm?

706
00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.673
He does for this one.

707
00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:19.759

Where on earth did you get these?

710
00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.232
-Found them.
-He found them!

711
00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:42.756
-And what is this?
-Sea mine.

712
00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.319
Sea mine.

713
00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:46.995
Well, Mr Webley,
this is an extremely dangerous collection.

714
00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.514
It's a wonder nobody's been hurt before.

715
00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.511
No, it's just a lot of junk.

we should do something to celebrate.

-You can get a little drunk.

-Yeah, Roy.

-Yeah. CSI found nothing.

and Mrs Blower has four alibis.

740
00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:52.392
Now, come on, Sergeant, it's not your job
to investigate this incident, is it?

741
00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.275
Is it?

-No, it isn't.
-No, it isn't.

Officer.

What made you wanna be
a policeman-officer?

749
00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:21.637
I don't remember a time
when I didn't wanna be a police officer.

750
00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:25.315
Apart from the summer of 1979
when I wanted to be Kermit the Frog.

751
00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:30.114
It all started with my Uncle Derek.
He was a Sergeant in the Met.

752
00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:32.999
He bought me a police pedal car
when I was five.

753
00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:35.117
I rode round in it every second I was awake.

754
00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:38.431
Arresting kids twice my size
for littering and spitting.

755
00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:41.478
I got beaten up a lot when I was young
but it didn't stop me.

756
00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.392
I wanted to be like Uncle Derek.

757
00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:44.515
He sounds like a good bloke.

758
00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:46.830
Actually, he was arrested
for selling drugs to students.

759
00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:47.990
What a cunt.

760
00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:50.390
Probably bought the pedal car
with the proceeds.

761
00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:53.632
Needless to say I never went near it again.
I just let it rust.

762
00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.677
But I never forgot
the clear sense of right and wrong

763
00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.671
that I felt at the wheel of that pedal car.

764
00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:00.274
I had to prove to myself
that the law could be proper

765
00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.636
and righteous
and for the good of humankind.

766
00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:06.190
It was from that moment,
I was destined to be a police officer.

767
00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.711
-Shame.
-How so?

768
00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.235
I think you would've made a great muppet.

769
00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:17.473
What about you? What made you
wanna become a police officer?

770
00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.832
I don't know. Dad does it.

771
00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:24.914
I think after my mum died, it's what
he wanted, you know, keep me close by.

772
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.834
-Do you mind if I ask how she died?
-Traffic collision.

774

and Eve very well of late.

783

Such a loss.

784
00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:09.635
What say we drink to their demise?

785
00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:11.199
Shouldn't that be "drink to their memories"?

786
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:13.430
Of course. Cheers.

787
00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.272

-Not you. Him.

Did you get it?

with the village's rustic aesthetic, is it?

-Twenty quid.

-You should get some house plants.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

813
00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:06.559
Yeah. I've been tending my Peace Lily
for about three years now.

814
00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:11.471
It oxygenates the room,
helps you think, relieves stress.

that it was a no holds barred,

This is about to go off.

842
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:29.879
(PHONE RINGING)

843
00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:33.113
This shit just got real.

844
00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:38.513
HATCHER: Nasty way to go.

845
00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:42.434
I think our Mr Merchant tried to have
a little fry up and left the gas on.

846
00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:47.238
Spends his whole life
devoted to the refrigerator

847
00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.756
then gets killed by an oven.

848
00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:53.872
I told him several times,
you shouldn't eat late at night.

849
00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:56.759
Oh, I don't know.
I quite like a little midnight gobble.

850
00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:57.989
Cocks.

851
00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:01.596
So, what do we reckon? Angel?

852
00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:03.950
Help me.

853
00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:07.871
Okay, we get a proper cordon up,
we let the fire crews finish their stuff,

854
00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:10.600
and then we get forensics in
to do a thorough sweep of the house.

855
00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:13.274
Very good. What he said.

856
00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:15.397
Sergeant Angel, hi-hi. A quick word?

857
00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:17.710
Mr Messenger,
a statement will be issued shortly.

858
00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:20.360
Actually, I just wanted to ask,
"What's your perfect Sunday?"

859
00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:22.716
I'll deal with the press, Sergeant.

860
00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:27.556
Now, my perfect Sunday
is a lovely long lie in...

861
00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:32.637
Fire to destroy all you've done

862
00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:37.915
Like in the films.

863
00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:40.954
MAN: Something like,
something out of Backdraft.

864
00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:45.872
-What are you thinking? Foul play?
-ANGEL: Maybe.

865
00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:49.756
We're just hoping to talk to the last people
to see Mr Merchant alive.

866
00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:55.030
Namely a Sergeant Knickerless Asswipe
and a Constable Fanny Batterbum.

867
00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:57.919
-That's us.
-Why is this such a big joke to you?

868
00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.399
Three people have died in a week.

869
00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:01.994
Oh, come on, Doctor Sherlock,
they were accidents.

870
00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:03.514
People have accidents every day.

871
00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:06.399
-The victims knew each other.
-Everyone knows everyone round here.

872
00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:09.598
Yeah. If you didn't see anything suspicious,
then who did?

873
00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:16.552
It's a bit of a blind spot, I'm afraid.

874
00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:18.790
We just catch the very edge
of the explosion.

875
00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:20.632
Nasty way to go.

876
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.189
-There was something took my eye.
-Really? What's that?

877
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.116
Sandford's most wanted.

878
00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:27.838
(ALL CHEERING)

879
00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:30.196
There you go. It was the swan all along.

880
00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:33.432
-This is not funny, Detective!
-Oh, give over, Miss Marples.

881
00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:35.830
Yeah, you do your job
and we'll do ours, eh?

882
00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:38.070
Yeah. Haven't you got
a church fete to look after?

883
00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:40.037
No, I have not!

884
00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.075
Actually.

885
00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:47.715
E

886
00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:48.816
REVEREND SHOOTER: Testing. Testing.

887
00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:49.816
Someone's in for a surprise at 3:00,
ladies and gentlemen.

888
00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:51.831
It's the raffle with
a very special guest presenter.

889
00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:54.389
Out in the country

890
00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:58.395
Far from all the sorts of noise of the city

891
00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:00.949
There's a village green

892
00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:04.749
It's been a long time since I last set eyes

893
00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:06.877
On the church with a steeple

894
00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:09.076
That's me after a couple of pints.

895
00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:10.560
Splat the rat.

896
00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:14.753
Splat the rat.

897
00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:18.717
Splat the rat.

898
00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:22.239
Shark!

899
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.877
Seen any murderings, Nicholarse?

900
00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:28.474
Come on, boys.
Leave Sergeant Angel alone, he's working.

901
00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:31.871
Sorry, Chief,
won't waste any more police time.

902
00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:33.109
Have a nice time.

903
00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:35.510
Actually, Nicholas,
you might as well take a break.

904
00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:38.274
Hey, great. I've got something to show you.

905
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.833
-This is a rifle range.
-You'll be really good at it.

906
00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:49.275
Feeling lucky, Sergeant?

907
00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:54.517
Three cans wins you the squeaky bunny,
five cans gets you the floppy lion.

908
00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:59.470
Take out all the little people,
you get to waltz off with the cuddly monkey.

909
00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:03.837
I thought I made it clear to you
how I feel about firearms.

910
00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:06.150
It's only an air rifle.

911
00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:07.555
Sergeant.

912
00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:27.078
Dear Lord!

913
00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:30.391
That was amazing.

914
00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:31.515
(GUN FIRES)

915
00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:37.479
-Thank you, Danny.
-I can't believe I shot someone.

916
00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:40.678
-He's a doctor, he can deal with it.
-I never shot anyone before.

917
00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:42.876
Danny, believe me,
it's not something you ever get used to.

918
00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:45.110
Yeah. Maybe we should
go on the bouncy castle.

919
00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:46.235
Take our minds off of it.

920
00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:48.152
-Sergeant Angel, hi-hi.
-Mr Messenger.

921
00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:50.754
I need to talk to you
about George Merchant. Alone.

922
00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:53.350
Churchyard. 3:00.

923
00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.030
What do you think he wants?

924
00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:59.033
REVEREND SHOOTER: Would
Sergeant Angel come to the stage, please?

925
00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:05.749
Here to announce the winners is the newest
addition to the Sandford Police Force.

926
00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:06.910
Service.

927
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.673
Sergeant Nicholas Angel.

928
00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:12.349
-Prick.
-Wanker.

929
00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:13.510
(FEEDBACK)

930
00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:15.671
Hello. Hello.

931
00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:36.477
The first name is Simon Skinner.

932
00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:40.839
He's in the loo.

933
00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:43.836
Too much of Joyce's lemonade, perhaps.

934
00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:46.394
(EXPLOSION)

935
00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:07.590
And the next name is...

936
00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:24.590
Tim, your number's up.

937
00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:34.839
Excuse me. Excuse me.

938
00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:38.389
Hi-hi.

939
00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:42.069
(EXCLAIMS)

940
00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:43.949
Oh, no!

941
00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:51.879
Stand back, stand back!
There's been a terrible accident.

942
00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:54.554
-Accident?
-Just an accident.

943
00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:57.800
It's all right, it's all right.
There's nothing to see.

944
00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:01.555
Come on, everybody. It's all right.
It's just an accident.

945
00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:11.479
FRANK: Nicholas, what is it?

946
00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:15.440
Sir, I think all these deaths are linked.
I think Tim Messenger was murdered.

947
00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:18.878
-Who could do something like this?
-Maybe it was the swan.

948
00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:21.918
-Apparently, they can break a man's arm.
-Or blow up a man's house.

949
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.833
-Listen, you pair of...
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Nicholas.

950
00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:27.550
Now, let me get this straight.

951
00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:32.354
-Are you saying that this is a crime scene?
-Yes, sir, I am.

952
00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:33.760
Very well.

953
00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:35.315
-Detectives.
-Sir.

954
00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:36.913
Start interviewing everyone
who was at the fete.

955
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.035
Oh, he's got shorts on.

956
00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:39.190
-Sergeant Fisher?
-What?

957
00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:40.634
-Secure the area.
-What?

958
00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:41.869
-PC Thatcher?
-Yes, love?

959
00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:43.519
Get the CSI down here.

960
00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:44.749
PC Walker?

961
00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:47.036
Patrol the churchyard with Saxon.

962
00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:50.192
Nicholas, Danny, you know what to do.

963
00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.311
Do you really think this is murder?

964
00:57:58.480 --> 00:57:59.993
I just don't think we should rule it out,
that's all.

965
00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:01.514
Yeah. I think you're right.

966
00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:03.750
I think you're talking a load of old shit.

967
00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:07.558
He thinks you're talking a load of shit.
Swings and roundabouts, isn't it?

968
00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:09.075
CARTWRIGHT: Pain in the arse.

969
00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:11.277
-Did you find anything?
-Yeah.

970
00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:13.112
I was extremely shocked
when I looked at my watch

971
00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:14.554
and discovered that I should be in the pub.

972
00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:16.836
Did you go to his house?
Did you read his articles?

973
00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:20.231
If you wanna wade through every copy of
the Sandford bloody Citizen, be our guest.

974
00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:22.152
It's your job, isn't it? Detect!

975
00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:26.313
This ain't the city, Mr Angel.
Not everyone's a murdering psychopath.

976
00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:29.757
It's high time you realised that.
You and your monkey.

977
00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:34.837
Did he mean me or that?

978
00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:38.556
Oh, maybe we should go home.

979
00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:41.718
-What do you mean?
-Well, there's nothing going on, is there?

980
00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:43.359
Have you listened to anything that I've said?

981
00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:44.510
What do you mean?

982
00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:46.079
Is anything I've told you
in the last two weeks

983
00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:48.117
-sunk into that thick skull of yours?
-Yeah.

984
00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:49.838
Has it? Like what?

985
00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:52.192
You said I could be
an amazing policeman-officer.

986
00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:54.590
There's always something going on, Danny.

987
00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:58.150
And you won't be an amazing police officer
until you understand that.

988
00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:00.516
Well, I remembered something else
you said and all.

989
00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:02.159
-Oh, did you now?
-Yeah.

990
00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:04.436
You don't know how to switch off!

991
00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:17.715


992
00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:38.639
Well, if you wanna wade through every copy

993
00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:40.916
of the Sandford bloody Citizen,
be our guest.

994
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.469
-Morning, Constable.
-All right?

995
01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:22.592
Thanks for the monkey.

996
01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:25.835
-Yours, isn't it?
-I won it for you.

997
01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:31.197
Danny, I think I'm on to something.

998
01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.395
-Are you?
-Yes.

999
01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:36.633
And I think with a little deliberation
we can figure out what links these deaths.

1000
01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:40.357
-We?
-Come on, partner. Let's go to work.

1001
01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:43.272
Oh, oh, Sergeant Angel?

1002
01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:47.797
-Someone from London called for you.
-Tell them I'll call them back.

1003
01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:49.670
-Tim Messenger.
-Go.

1004
01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.512
Editor and journalist
at The Sandford Citizen.

1005
01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:52.829
-Fondness for puns.
-Go on.

1006
01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:53.990
-Terrible speller.
-Oh, yeah?

1007
01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:55.957
Nevertheless had uncovered
important information about...

1008
01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.713
-George Merchant.
-Self-made millionaire.

1009
01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:59.916
Fancied himself as a property developer.

1010
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.640
-Said he had big plans for Sandford.
-Pissed on the floor in The Crown.

1011
01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.791
But more importantly,
was a good friend and client of...

1012
01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.553
-Martin Blower.
-Respected solicitor.

1013
01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:08.790
-Affirmatron.
-Leading light of the local drama society.

1014
01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:10.234
-Bad actor.
-Undoubtedly.

1015
01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:11.799
-Bad driver.
-Not necessarily.

1016
01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.473
-Cheated on his missus.
-Most certainly.

1017
01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.437
-And we both know who with.
-Eve Draper.

1018
01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:18.239
-Blower's leading lady. Distinctive laugh.
-True.

1019
01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:19.674
-Favoured older men.
-Fingered.

1020
01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:20.955
-Worked at?
-Council.

1021
01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.634
-More specifically?
-Department of Planning and Development.

1022
01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:25.279
Where George Merchant secured permission

1023
01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:27.636
to build his dubious mansion
on Norris Avenue.

1024
01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:28.790
So...

1025
01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:32.794
Maybe they were all accidents.
People have accidents every day.

(MOCKING)

1027
01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:36.469
-What are you two up to?
-Nothing.

1028
01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.630
Well, look sharp.

1029
01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:40.360
-There's been reports of a fire in the station.
-What?

1030
01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:43.956
Happy birthday to you

1031
01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:48.079
Happy birthday to you

1032
01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:51.676
-Danny, why didn't you say something?
-We were working, weren't we?

1033
01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:56.918
-Hey, where are you going?
-Personal errand.

1034
01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:59.193
(SIREN BLARING)

1035
01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.794
Hello, Miss Tiller.

1036
01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:07.474
I was wondering,
do you have any Japanese Peace Lilies?

1037
01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:08.914
Of course.

1038
01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:11.995
I was just about to pop off, actually.

1039
01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:14.996
I can never find my scissors.

1040
01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:19.029
-Is this for someone special?
-Yes. Yes, it is.

1041
01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:25.797
-Are you going somewhere, Miss Tiller?
-Yes. I'm moving away.

1042
01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:29.918
And why the move,
if you don't mind me asking?

1043
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.631
-Well, just between you and I...
-Yes?

1044
01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.639
-You know that fella who blew up?
-George Merchant.

1045
01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:40.758
Well, George Merchant, God rest him,
wanted to buy this land,

1046
01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:44.276
so he sends round his legal fella,
Martin Blower, God rest him,

1047
01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.397
and I thought I might take them up on it.

1048
01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:50.030
I haven't really got that much family
round here, save for Cousin Sissy.

1049
01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:53.431
So I thought I might take them up
on the offer and move to Buford Abbey.

1050
01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.431
Would you like a card with this?

1051
01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:57.796
No, sorry, you were talking about the offer?

1052
01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:00.952
Well, it turns out that Martin Blower,
God rest him,

1053
01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:03.111
knew where the new bypass road is going

1054
01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:06.158
because he was knocking off Eve Draper
from the council, God rest her,

1055
01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:09.790
and then that reporter, God rest him,
finds out about the route

1056
01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:11.917
and tells me this land's very valuable.

1057
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.914
Ten times what George Merchant and
Martin Blower, God rest them, offered me.

1058
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.879
So, with them having passed on,
I decided to sell it on myself

1059
01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.634
to some folks from the city
that Martin, George and Eve,

1060
01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:23.677
God rest the lot of them,
had been talking to.

1061
01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:26.479
Apparently, they want to build
a big shopping centre or something.

1062
01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:29.234
Of course, Cousin Sissy won't be
too happy about that,

1063
01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:31.311
but as far as I'm concerned,
Cousin Sissy can go and fuck...

1064
01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:33.914
Would you just excuse me,
for just one second?

1065
01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:49.669
Stop!

1066
01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:52.079
In the name of the law!

1067
01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:49.791
Hang about, hang about.

1068
01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:52.796
You're saying this wasn't an accident?

1069
01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:56.037
Leslie Tiller was fucking murdered!

1070
01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.519
-What, just like Tim Messenger?
-Yes!

1071
01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:58.715
-And George Merchant?
-Yes!

1072
01:04:58.800 --> 01:04:59.995
-And Eve Draper?
-Yes!

1073
01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:01.639
-And Martin Blower?
-No, actually.

1074
01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:03.518
-Really?
-'Course he fucking was!

1075
01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.432
Thank you, Danny.

1076
01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:08.717
Oh, murder, murder, murder.
Change the fucking record.

1077
01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.395
Thank you, Andy.

1078
01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:14.553
Come on, Sergeant, you've gotta accept
it was just another nasty accident.

1079
01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:15.675
What are you suggesting?

1080
01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:18.149
That Leslie Tiller tripped
and fell on her own shears?

1081
01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:20.595
Ben Fletcher fell
on his pitchfork the other week.

1082
01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:23.991
Yeah, accidents happen all the time.
What makes you think it was murder?

1083
01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:26.913
-Because I was there!
-There's a point.

1084
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.320
Why were you there?

1085
01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:32.473
I was buying Constable Butterman
a Japanese Peace Lily for his birthday.

1086
01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:35.029
What absolute horseshit.

1087
01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:38.909
I chased a suspect from the scene.
Innocent people don't run!

1088
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.958
Here, maybe it was our old friend,
the cactus thief.

1089
01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:44.634
Oh, yeah, he was a prickly customer,
weren't he?

1090
01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:48.034
Am I going completely mad?

1091
01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:51.673
Maybe you are.

1092
01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:56.160
Maybe you did it.

1093
01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:59.437
Yeah, seeing as how you're such
a big fan of murder.

1094
01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:00.874
-What the...
-Sergeant Angel?

1095
01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:03.349
Yes! Sir.

1096
01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:08.593
Nicholas, Nicholas, Nicholas.

1097
01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:11.149
What am I going to do with you?

1098
01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:15.598
-Sir, you have to understand...
-No, you have to understand.

1099
01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:20.349
The boys here aren't used
to the concepts you're bandying about.

1100
01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:23.349
The "M" word, Nicholas.

1101
01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:27.479
There hasn't been a recorded murder
in Sandford for 20 years.

1102
01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:29.312
But, sir, I'm certain.

1103
01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:32.918
And what's more, I know who did it.

1104
01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:38.235


1105
01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.552
Can I see the manager, please?

1106
01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:51.552
Mr Skinner to the Manager's office.
Manager's office. Mr Skinner.

1107
01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.551
Sergeant Angel.
And to what do I owe this pleasure?

1108
01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:59.554
Simon Skinner, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of the murder of Leslie Tiller.

1109
01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:02.951
Leslie Tiller's dead? How?

1110
01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.310
She tripped and fell on her own shears.

1111
01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:06.470
(GROANS)

1112
01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:10.077
I'm also arresting you on suspicion of
the murder of Tim Messenger on May 1st,

1113
01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:11.719
of George Merchant on April 29th

1114
01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:14.269
and of Eve Draper
and Martin Blower on April 28th.

1115
01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:18.194
-Why on earth would I do that, Sergeant?
-I'm glad you asked.

1116
01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:21.951
My suspicions were first aroused
when you appeared

1117
01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:24.714
at the scene of the Blower-Draper death,
on the outskirts of Sandford,

1118
01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:28.475
despite the fact you live and work
in the centre of the village.

1119
01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:33.793
I couldn't help but recall your comments
at the theatre on the previous evening.

1120
01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.873
When you not only indicated
an awareness of the couple's affair

1121
01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.871
but also inferred
that Eve's connections at the council

1122
01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:41.793
might make her privy
to important information.

1123
01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:44.076
You even spoke of "bashing her head in."

1124
01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:47.630
Perhaps hoping you might discover
the route of the proposed Sandford Bypass.

1125
01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:49.870
You were already suspicious
that George Merchant was buying up

1126
01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:52.156
a large area of land
on the outskirts of Sandford,

1127
01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:55.073
after an article Tim Messenger
wrote in the Sandford Citizen.

1128
01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:58.676
You see, the land Merchant was buying
had little value in of itself but,

1129
01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:02.515
if it became accessible by road,
it would be a prime location for say,

1130
01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:04.473
a retail park.

1131
01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:06.471
Consumed with concern for your business

1132
01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:08.517
and potential disloyalty
from fickle customers,

1133
01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:11.069
you yourself expressed a wish to behead.

1134
01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:14.120
You killed the competition in cold blood.

1135
01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.032
Staging the murders as accidents.

1136
01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:19.078
You used a vehicle removal truck
to stage the Blower-Draper death

1137
01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:20.992
and incinerated an old man
in his own house.

1138
01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:24.152
Covering your tracks with the judicial
application of bacon and beans.

1139
01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:27.073
However, there was a loose end.

1140
01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.479
Tim Messenger.

1141
01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:31.631
Splattered before he could share with me

1142
01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:34.553
what he told Leslie Tiller
that very afternoon.

1143
01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:37.359
The true value of her land.

1144
01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:40.519
Upon discovering she was about
to sell up to the developers,

1145
01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:43.319
you brutally murdered her
with her own shears.

1146
01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:47.951
And made good your escape utilising
your impressive skills as a fun runner.

1147
01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:57.790
Very entertaining. But I rather think
you've been watching too many films.

1148
01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:59.234
(CLEARS THROAT)

1149
01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:00.355
He hasn't.

1150
01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:04.035
Why would [ kill Leslie?
You clearly aren't aware that we're related.

1151
01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:06.589
Oh, but I am, "Cousin Sissy."

1152
01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:12.193
I'm afraid my nickname of Sissy
is only a revelation to yourself.

1153
01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:15.711
My teenage years studying ballet
are well known.

1154
01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:18.838
-Yeah, Sissy Skinner.
-What a Gaylord.

1155
01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.399
Thank you, Andrews.

1156
01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:23.711
Now, despite my comments
about "beheading” customers,

1157
01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:27.191
I personally relish the competition
of another store.

1158
01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:30.750
Anything to energise my workforce.

1159
01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:36.637
And anyway, what makes you think
I could dislodge part of the church roof?

1160
01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:39.075
Or for that matter, stage a car crash?

1161
01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:42.391
It's a well known fact that
the church roof is in dire need of repair.

1162
01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:44.551
And isn't it true
that two of your own employees

1163
01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:46.995
operate the vehicle removal service
for the council?

1164
01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:49.356
Sergeant, this is the 21st Century.

1165
01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:52.239
Many people hold down several jobs.

1166
01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:55.870
I myself host a life drawing class
at the Village Hall.

1167
01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:58.873
Tina here is a table dancer at Flappers.

1168
01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:02.909
Nevertheless, you could have utilised
the vehicle removal truck for your own ends.

1169
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.957
These accusations
are quite meaningless, Sergeant,

1170
01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:07.554
unless you can back them up
with hard evidence.

1171
01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:10.109
Well, you've got me there.

1172
01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:12.111
I'd need something conclusive.

1173
01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.271
Something that placed you
at the scene of the crime.

1174
01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:18.240
Perhaps a wound you sustained on
a piece of broken glass this very evening.

1175
01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:21.393
This very evening.

1176
01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:25.752
Sergeant, this is beginning
to get embarrassing.

1177
01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:28.878
How could I possibly be
in several places at once?

1178
01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:35.551
I'm sure the store's security footage
will absolve me.

1179
01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:38.800
Do feel free to spool through.

1180
01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:56.595
I can handle this, Danny.

1181

You might as well go back
and just enjoy the rest of your birthday.

-Did you really get me that plant?
-Yes, I did.

maybe Dad will still let me water it, eh?

Yeah.

1186
01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:16.154
Sergeant, I wanted you to know that

1187
01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:19.437
if I do indeed now
own the land belonging to...

1188
01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:26.718
belonging to Leslie, that I intend to turn it
into a memorial garden, in her honour.

You see, as much as I enjoyed
your wild theories, Sergeant,

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:19.398
the truth is far less complex.

1282
01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:24.475
Blower's fate was simply the result
of his being an appalling actor.

1283

is an important feather in our cap.

HATCHER: Couldn't let
Blower jeopardise that.

1288
01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:39.630
Not when we had two semi-professionals
waiting in the wings.

1289
01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:42.189
Let's not forget that Greg
was an extra in Straw Dogs.

1290
01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:44.078
And Sheree played a cadaver
in Prime Suspect.

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:45.514
Yes, I know!

1292
01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:48.114
Martin was less concerned
with the reputation of the village

1293
01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:51.272
than he was with his sordid affair
with Eve Draper.

1294
01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:52.873
And so Eve deserved to die too?

1295
01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:55.270

-He had an awful house.

1299
01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:02.353
We begged him in vain
to make his residence

more in keeping
with the village's rustic aesthetic.

1301
01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:08.389
And what about Tim Messenger?
What was his crime?

1302
01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:12.997
Tim Messenger's tenure as editor of
the Sandford Citizen has been unbearable.

1303
01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:16.755
Our once great paper had
become riddled with tabloid journalism.

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:18.717

-When, actually, I'm 53.

1307
01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:25.113
What, what about Leslie Tiller?
One of your own?

1308
01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:27.589
Her horticultural expertise helped
put Sandford on the map.

1309
01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:29.637
Oh, she was ever so good.

1310
01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:31.791
Cousin Leslie was a terrible shame.

1311
01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:35.630
But it seemed she was set on moving away.

1312
01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:38.951
We couldn't have her sharing
her green fingers with anybody else.

1313
01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:40.917
Not least those heathens at Buford Abbey.

1314
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.560
If we can't have her, no one can.

1315
01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:45.153
How can this be for the greater good?

1316
01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:47.197
-ALL: The greater good.
-Shut it!

1317
01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:50.318
These people died for no reason.
No reason whatsoever!

1318
01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:52.789
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

1319
01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:55.800
Hello, Nicholas.

1320
01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:58.672
I was like you once.

1321
01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:02.557
I believed in the immutable word of the law.

1322
01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:06.515
That is until the night Mrs Butterman
was taken from me.

1323
01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:09.960
You see,
no one loved Sandford more than her.

1324
01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:13.874
She was head of the Women's Institute,
chair of the floral committee.

1325
01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:15.951
When they started
the Village of the Year contest,

1326
01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:19.590
she worked round the clock.
I've never seen such dedication.

1327
01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:26.000
On the eve of the adjudicator's arrival,
some travellers moved into Callahan Park.

1328
01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:30.151
Before you could say, "Gypsy scum,”
we were knee-deep in dog muck,

1329
01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:32.470
thieving kids and crusty jugglers.

1330
01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:34.233
ALL: Crusty jugglers.

1331
01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:37.278
We lost the title and Irene lost her mind.

1332
01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:42.194
She drove her Datsun Cherry
into Sandford Gorge.

1333
01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:47.195
From that moment on,
I swore that I would do her proud.

1334
01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:51.832
And whatever the cost,
we would make Sandford great again.

This is the best village, Nicholas.
You've seen the people.

-They're happy, contented.
-They're living in a dream world.

thought much the same as you.
