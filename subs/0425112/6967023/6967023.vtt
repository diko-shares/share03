Hello, Nicholas.

28
00:02:28.482 --> 00:02:29.767
Hello, sergeant.

29
00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:31.098
How's the hand?

30
00:02:31.193 --> 00:02:32.433
Still a bit stiff.

31
00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:35.273
It can get awfully
hairy out there.

32
00:02:35.364 --> 00:02:37.884
I'm surprised you weren't snapped
up sooner for a nice desk job.

33
00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:38.984
That's what I did.

34
00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:41.358
I prefer to think my office
is out on the street.

35
00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:42.985
Indeed, you do.

36
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.744
Your arrest record is 400%
higher than any other officer.

37
00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:52.498
Which is why it's high time that
such skills were put to better use.

38
00:02:54.383 --> 00:02:55.919
We're making you sergeant.

39
00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.169
I see.

40
00:02:57.636 --> 00:02:59.376
In sandford, Gloucestershire.

41
00:02:59.513 --> 00:03:00.548
In where, sorry?

42
00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.129
In sandford, Gloucestershire.

43
00:03:02.224 --> 00:03:03.839
That's in the country.

44
00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:05.424
Yes, lovely.

45
00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:08.039
Isn't there a sergeant's
position here in London?

46
00:03:08.063 --> 00:03:09.269
No.

47
00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:10.471
Can I remain here as a PC?

48
00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:11.645
No.

49
00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:12.893
Do I have any choice in this?

50
00:03:12.943 --> 00:03:14.183
No.

51
00:03:15.237 --> 00:03:16.977
Sergeant,
I kind of like it here.

52
00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:19.192
Well, you've always wanted
to transfer to the country.

53
00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:20.609
In 20 years or so, yes.

54
00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:22.032
Well done, you.

55
00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:24.216
Hang on, I don't remember
telling you that.

56
00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.365
Yes, you did. You said,

57
00:03:26.498 --> 00:03:29.490
"I'd love to settle down in the
country sometime, Janine."

58
00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.492
I'd like to talk
to the inspector.

59
00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:34.649
You can speak to the inspector,
but I can promise you

60
00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:37.585
he will tell you exactly
the same thing as I have.

61
00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:41.300
Hello, Nicholas. How's the hand?

62
00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:42.798
It's still a bit stiff.

63
00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.049
And how are things at home?

64
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:45.256
I'm sorry, sir?

65
00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:46.882
How's Janine?

66
00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:50.302
We're no longer together, sir.

67
00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:51.807
Right. Then where
are you living?

68
00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:53.376
He's staying at the
section house, sir.

69
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.544
Inspector: With the recruits?

70
00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:56.354
Yes, he's living out
of cardboard boxes.

71
00:03:56.445 --> 00:03:58.310
Well, then,
you're packed already.

72
00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:00.133
Nicholas, we're offering
you a smashing position

73
00:04:00.157 --> 00:04:01.363
with a delightful cottage,

74
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.863
in a lovely little place that I
think has won village of the year

75
00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:06.659
I don't know how many times.

76
00:04:06.747 --> 00:04:08.362
It'll be good for you.

77
00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:11.039
I don't really know what to say.

78
00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:12.206
Yes?

79
00:04:12.294 --> 00:04:13.909
Yes, thank you.

80
00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:18.251
No, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to...

81
00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:19.919
You want to take this higher?

82
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.295
Yes, yes, I do.

83
00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:23.364
You want me to bother the
chief inspector with this?

84
00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:24.423
Yes.

85
00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:25.950
You want me to get
the chief inspector

86
00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:27.555
to come all the way down here?

87
00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:29.007
Yes, I do.

88
00:04:29.186 --> 00:04:30.392
Okay.

89
00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:32.386
Kenneth!

90
00:04:32.898 --> 00:04:34.638
Hello, Nicholas. How's the hand?

91
00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:36.314
Still a bit stiff.

92
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.225
Chief inspector...
Keep your seat.

93
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.527
Now, I know what
you're going to say,

94
00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:43.902
but the fact is, you've been
making us all look bad.

95
00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:45.072
I'm sorry, sir?

96
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.721
Of course we all
appreciate your efforts,

97
00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:49.282
but you've been rather
letting the side down.

98
00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:51.325
It's all about being
a team player, Nicholas.

99
00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.414
You can't be the
sheriff of London.

100
00:04:53.502 --> 00:04:55.288
If we let you carry on
running round town,

101
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.208
you'll continue to be exceptional
and we can't have that.

102
00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:01.631
You'll put us all out of a job.

103
00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:03.713
With respect, sir.

104
00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:06.216
You can't just make
people disappear.

105
00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:09.139
Yes, I can.
I'm the chief inspector.

106
00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:14.478
Well, however you spin this, there's one
thing you haven't taken into account.

107
00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:17.097
And that's what the "team"
is gonna make of this.

108
00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:34.580
Hello?  Janine, it's me.

109
00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:36.750
I know. I'm at work.

110
00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:38.748
I know, I'm outside.

111
00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:42.247
What's the situation?

112
00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:45.425
You know the situation.
We've been over this.

113
00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:46.922
No, I... I meant here.

114
00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:49.675
Two people involved,
distinct signs of a struggle.

115
00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:50.926
Complete mess.

116
00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.302
You are talking about here?

117
00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:54.100
Nicholas, what do you want?

118
00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:55.873
Well, I have something
important to tell you

119
00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:58.354
and I didn't wanna
do it over the phone.

120
00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:01.767
Janine, I've been transferred.

121
00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:03.352
I'm moving away for a while.

122
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.610
I'm not Janine.

123
00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:07.238
Janine, I've been transferred.

124
00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:08.610
I'm moving away for a while.

125
00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:10.442
I know. Bob told me.

126
00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:11.697
Hello, there.

127
00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:13.870
Well, I wanted to
tell you in person.

128
00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:16.143
And there's no reason we can't
be civil with each other.

129
00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:18.020
It's not that long ago we were
talking about getting married.

130
00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:20.956
Yes, but you were already married
to the force, weren't you?

131
00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:22.942
We're actually supposed to
call it "the service" now.

132
00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:24.297
Official vocab guidelines state

133
00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:25.624
that "force" is too aggressive.

134
00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:27.550
See. It's only ever
about the job.

135
00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:28.717
It's all you care about.

136
00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:29.805
That's not true.

137
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.802
No, you're right, you do
have that rubber plant.

138
00:06:32.893 --> 00:06:34.349
It's a Japanese peace Lily. Rp

139
00:06:34.436 --> 00:06:36.677
you just can't switch off,
Nicholas.

140
00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:40.981
And until you find a person you
care about more than your job,

141
00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:42.557
you never will.

142
00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:45.048
Besides, you were
the one who suggested

143
00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:46.649
we take a break.

144
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.733
Yes, well, guilty people
often make the first move.

145
00:06:51.912 --> 00:06:53.903
Actually, there's something
I need to tell you.

146
00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:55.245
You're seeing someone else.

147
00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:56.492
Yes. How did you...

148
00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:58.574
Is it Bob? No.

149
00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:02.160
Does Bob look like the kind
of person I'd go out with?

150
00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:03.745
It's Dave

151
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.250
hello, there.

152
00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:07.673
I see.

153
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.210
Oh, Nicholas.

154
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.092
You do realize that window
was broken from the inside?

155
00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:22.431
Hello there, Nicholas, frank
Butterman here, your new inspector.

156
00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:25.688
I'm just calling with details
of your accommodation.

157
00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:28.896
We've got you a lovely little
cottage on Spencer hill.

158
00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.781
Look forward to meeting
you anon. Cheerio.

159
00:07:33.078 --> 00:07:34.534
Nicholas, frank again.

160
00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:36.202
One other thing
about your cottage.

161
00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:37.619
It's not reaqly.

162
00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:22.828
It would appear the
heavens have opened.

163
00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:31.837
I was hoping to check in.

164
00:08:32.637 --> 00:08:33.968
Check in?

165
00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:36.763
But you've always been here.
Vi y

166
00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:38.507
excuse me?

167
00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:41.093
Oh, I'm sorry.

168
00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:42.927
I thought you were my husband.

169
00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:44.308
You must be sergeant angel.

170
00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:45.684
Yes, I am.

171
00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:46.852
I'm Joyce Cooper.

172
00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:49.104
I trust you had a pleasant trip.
Fascist.

173
00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:50.897
I beg your pardon?

174
00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:54.823
"System of government characterized
by extreme dictatorship."

175
00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:56.319
Seven across.

176
00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:58.614
Oh, I see. It's "fascism."

177
00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:01.321
Fascism. Wonderful.

178
00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:03.490
Now, we've put you
in the castle suite.

179
00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:05.997
Bernard will escort you
up there.

180
00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:11.336
Well, actually, I could probably
make my own way up. Hag.

181
00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:13.541
I beg your pardon?

182
00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:17.466
"Evil old woman considered
frightful or ugly." It's 12 down.

183
00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:20.173
Oh, bless you.

184
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.641
Pint of lager, please, Mary.

185
00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:09.472
 Right you are, my love.

186
00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:11.565
Yes, sir, what can I get you?

187
00:10:11.694 --> 00:10:16.563
Could I have a glass of the
cranberry juice, please?

188
00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:17.939
Certainly.

189
00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:21.489
Now, you wouldn't, by any
chance, be the new policeman?

190
00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:23.615
Police officer, yes.
I'm Nicholas angel.

191
00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:25.488
I'm Roy Porter.
This is my wife Mary.

192
00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:26.698
Mary.

193
00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:28.367
 Welcome to sandford.

194
00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:30.064
If there's anything you
need, just let us know.

195
00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:33.330
Thank you. Could I
borrow your newspaper?

196
00:10:33.424 --> 00:10:34.664
It's not ours, love.

197
00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:37.341
We're not big fans of the local
fish wrapper, are we, mare?

198
00:10:37.428 --> 00:10:39.214
They listed her age as 55.

199
00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:41.011
When I'm actually $3.

200
00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:42.339
Fifty-three.

201
00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.425
Pint of lager, please, Mary.

202
00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.101
Right you are, my love.

203
00:11:19.888 --> 00:11:20.923
Excuse me.

204
00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:22.049
What?

205
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.220
When's your birthday?

206
00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:24.548
Twenty-second of February.

207
00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:26.633
What year? Every year.

208
00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:27.849
Get out.

209
00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:30.887
When's your birthday?

210
00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:34.224
Eighth of may, 1969.

211
00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:36.105
You're 377 yeah.

212
00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:37.311
Get out.

213
00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:38.527
When's your birthday?

214
00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:40.939
Out.

215
00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:42.987
Is there a problem, officer?

216
00:11:43.077 --> 00:11:44.567
Yes, there is, Mr. Porter.

217
00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:47.449
It would appear a number of
your patrons are under age.

218
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.247
Well, a few of them may be a
month or two south of proper.

219
00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:53.077
But if they're in here, it stops
them getting into trouble out there.

220
00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:55.412
Yeah, the way we see it, it's
all for the greater good.

221
00:11:55.506 --> 00:11:56.621
The greater good.

222
00:11:56.716 --> 00:12:01.005
Well, that's as may be, but the law's
the law and they'll have to go.

223
00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:07.594
Another cranberry juice?

224
00:12:07.685 --> 00:12:09.141
I'm fine, thank you.

225
00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:33.534
I hope you're not
planning on driving that.

226
00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:34.868
No.

227
00:12:50.728 --> 00:12:53.720
Right. I'm taking you
to the station.

228
00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:56.685
Where is it?

229
00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:04.564
What?

230
00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:16.371
 Move.

231
00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:23.132
"Nicholas angel.”

232
00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:25.501
Oh, when did you start?

233
00:13:25.596 --> 00:13:27.052
Tomorrow.

234
00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:29.631
Well, I see you've already
arrested the whole village.

235
00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:30.847
Not exactly.

236
00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:34.644
You in for the night?
Go on, four's free.

237
00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:36.103
Hey, now, I need
to speak to him.

238
00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.101
He'll be no use
till the morning.

239
00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:39.349
I see.

240
00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:42.436
You really want to
process all this lot?

241
00:13:43.323 --> 00:13:44.563
My pen"s running out.

242
00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:45.897
Not a problem.

243
00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:25.524
Morning, sergeant.

244
00:14:25.615 --> 00:14:26.615
Morning.

245
00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:27.859
Morning.

246
00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:30.111
Morning, sergeant.

247
00:14:32.163 --> 00:14:34.028
Morning, sergeant.

248
00:14:39.128 --> 00:14:40.208
Lock me up.

249
00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:41.296
I'm I ss so orry'?

250
00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:43.497
I'm a slasher and
I must be stopped.

251
00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:45.419
You're a what?

252
00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.047
A slasher of prices.

253
00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:52.422
Just kidding. I'm Simon Skinner.

254
00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:54.553
I run the local supermarché.

255
00:14:54.644 --> 00:14:56.305
Drop in and see me sometime.

256
00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:58.057
My discounts are criminal.

257
00:14:58.481 --> 00:15:00.062
Catch me later!

258
00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:04.354
Morning, sergeant.

259
00:15:09.992 --> 00:15:12.108
Morning, sergeant.

260
00:15:15.706 --> 00:15:18.243
Could you tell the inspector
I've arrived, please?

261
00:15:19.293 --> 00:15:20.373
No.

262
00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.376
Why?

263
00:15:22.713 --> 00:15:24.578
He's not in yet.

264
00:15:25.007 --> 00:15:26.213
Well, how's our guest?

265
00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:27.958
Guest?

266
00:15:28.052 --> 00:15:29.462
The inebriate in cell four.

267
00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:32.717
I don't know.
Nobody tells me nothing.

268
00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:39.476
Can I get cell
four open, please?

269
00:15:39.564 --> 00:15:41.646
Danny, can you open four?

270
00:15:44.193 --> 00:15:45.308
He's gone.

271
00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:53.695
Why are you dressed
like a police officer?

272
00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:55.822
Because I am one.

273
00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:59.072
Sergeant angel, at last.
Frank Butterman.

274
00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:02.242
I see you've already met my boy.

275
00:16:02.336 --> 00:16:03.496
Yes.

276
00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:08.581
 Do forgive me. I'm
something of a wild west nut.

277
00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:10.674
Speaking of which, that
was a fair few outlaws

278
00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:13.047
you rounded up last night.

279
00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:14.758
Thank you, sir.

280
00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:19.760
I admire your enthusiasm and far be
it from me to stifle your flair,

281
00:16:19.896 --> 00:16:21.181
but this isn't London.

282
00:16:21.272 --> 00:16:22.603
Oh, yes, please, Danny.

283
00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:23.770
With respect, sir,

284
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.380
geographical location
shouldn't factor

285
00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:28.521
no, thanks.

286
00:16:28.613 --> 00:16:32.526
Statistically, sandford is the
safest village in the country.

287
00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:34.778
But that doesn't mean
it requires anything less

288
00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:37.368
than a careful and
considered approach.

289
00:16:37.455 --> 00:16:38.599
There's a reason we accommodate

290
00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:40.363
a few of the younglings
at the pub.

291
00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:41.538
The greater good?

292
00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:43.958
The greater good. Precisely.

293
00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:48.288
Your predecessor assumed that
rural policing was easy.

294
00:16:49.133 --> 00:16:51.124
Ended up having
a nervous breakdown.

295
00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:55.378
And sergeant popwell was an exceptional
officer, truly exceptional.

296
00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.131
And he had one thing
you haven't got.

297
00:16:58.267 --> 00:16:59.267
What's that, sir?

298
00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:01.183
A great big bushy beard.

299
00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.306
Come on, let's have
a mosey around.

300
00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:06.981
Locker room.

301
00:17:08.402 --> 00:17:09.892
Riot room.

302
00:17:12.114 --> 00:17:13.570
Evidence room.

303
00:17:16.494 --> 00:17:20.578
Now, how about
a trip to the andes?

304
00:17:20.665 --> 00:17:22.075
Detective sergeant Wainwright

305
00:17:22.166 --> 00:17:24.498
and detective constable
Cartwright.

306
00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:27.498
Don't get up.

307
00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:31.335
I expect you're wondering
why we call them the andes.

308
00:17:31.467 --> 00:17:33.173
They're both called Andrew?

309
00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:35.092
They said you were good.

310
00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:36.865
Also, because talking to
them is an uphill struggle,

311
00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:38.220
isn't it, dad?

312
00:17:38.307 --> 00:17:39.307
Fuck off!

313
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:40.430
Thank you, Danny.

314
00:17:46.357 --> 00:17:49.474
And this is where
it all happens.

315
00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:53.103
That is sergeant Tony Fisher.

316
00:17:53.197 --> 00:17:54.528
PC Bob Walker.

317
00:17:55.992 --> 00:17:57.323
And that is Saxon.

318
00:17:57.868 --> 00:18:01.952
And this is one Doris Thatcher.

319
00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:03.100
She's our only policewoman.

320
00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:04.239
She's not a policewoman. P

321
00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:05.477
yeah, she is. I've seen her bra.

322
00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:06.536
She's a police officer.

323
00:18:06.627 --> 00:18:08.146
Being a woman has
nothing to do with it.

324
00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:10.206
Oh, I don't know. Comes
in handy every so often.

325
00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:12.129
I could've given you the tour.

326
00:18:12.216 --> 00:18:14.047
I've been round
the station a few times.

327
00:18:14.385 --> 00:18:15.875
And what's upstairs?

328
00:18:17.638 --> 00:18:20.220
Well, well, well,
I see we have visitors.

329
00:18:20.308 --> 00:18:22.549
This is Tom Weaver.

330
00:18:22.977 --> 00:18:26.390
Civilian liaison with the
neighborhood watch alliance.

331
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.597
You'll find that we run
a very tight ship here.

332
00:18:31.068 --> 00:18:36.358
From this command center I can see
what the whole village is up to.

333
00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:40.991
I must say I was rather admiring
your handiwork last night.

334
00:18:41.078 --> 00:18:43.660
It's a pity you didn't do the
same to those bloody hoodies.

335
00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:46.364
Hanging around.
Loitering. Sitting.

336
00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:48.871
Actually, I did notice some
minor graffiti on the fountain.

337
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:51.293
Graffiti? They've gotta
be dealt with, frank.

338
00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.621
They're nippers, Tom.
They'll come round.

339
00:18:53.716 --> 00:18:54.956
Which reminds me,

340
00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:58.384
our friend, the living statue,
was here on Saturday.

341
00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:03.511
11:00, 12:00, 1:00, 2:00.

342
00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:06.434
If we don't come down hard
on these clowns,

343
00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.602
we are gonna be up to
our balls in jugglers.

344
00:19:08.689 --> 00:19:10.771
We'll get right onto it, Tom.

345
00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:15.435
We like to let them think
they run the place.

346
00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:17.269
Well, that's that.

347
00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:19.777
Unless there's anything
you're unclear about?

348
00:19:19.867 --> 00:19:23.075
Yes, sir. Why is everybody
eating chocolate cake?

349
00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:25.027
The black forest
gateau is on Danny.

350
00:19:25.122 --> 00:19:27.408
As punishment for his
little indiscretion.

351
00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:30.228
Sir, I don't think driving
under the influence

352
00:19:30.252 --> 00:19:31.992
can be called
a "little indiscretion.”

353
00:19:32.088 --> 00:19:35.251
No, the gateau is for misplacing
his helmet the other week.

354
00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:39.300
Last night's incident will require
something rather more serious.

355
00:19:39.387 --> 00:19:41.673
Good. Do you like ice-cream?

356
00:19:41.764 --> 00:19:43.504
I'm sorry, sir, I don't follow.

357
00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:45.089
Let's just say that
we won't be short

358
00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:46.799
of chunky monkey
for the next month.

359
00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.180
Dad.

360
00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:51.387
Now, since it's your first
day and it's 11:30,

361
00:19:51.482 --> 00:19:53.063
I'd say that's lunch.

362
00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:03.984
So, what made you choose
sandford then, sergeant angel?

363
00:20:04.078 --> 00:20:05.693
It wasn't actually my choice.

364
00:20:05.788 --> 00:20:08.029
Oh, right, right, wasn't your
choice to come down here

365
00:20:08.124 --> 00:20:09.955
and tell me how to do my job.

366
00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:11.248
Our jobs.

367
00:20:13.295 --> 00:20:14.375
 Yeah.

368
00:20:15.339 --> 00:20:18.251
Look, I can assure you it wasn't my
intention to upset the apple cart.

369
00:20:18.342 --> 00:20:21.584
Yeah, 'cause we all sell
apples round here, don't we?

370
00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:22.919
Your dad sells apples, Andy.

371
00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:24.503
And raspberries.

372
00:20:24.598 --> 00:20:27.180
I bet you can't wait to jump
into sergeant popwell's grave.

373
00:20:27.268 --> 00:20:29.429
I'm not jumping
into anyone's grave.

374
00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.470
You got a mustache.

375
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.100
I know.

376
00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:36.440
Why have you got
your stab vest on?

377
00:20:36.527 --> 00:20:37.892
It's a requirement.

378
00:20:37.987 --> 00:20:42.276
In the city maybe. Nobody's gonna
stab you in here, sergeant.

379
00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:44.566
Not a member of
the public anyhow.

380
00:20:46.662 --> 00:20:48.277
Have you been stabbed,
sergeant Fisher?

381
00:20:48.372 --> 00:20:49.407
No.

382
00:20:49.498 --> 00:20:50.908
Well, I have.

383
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.582
And I can assure you it is not
in the least bit amusing.

384
00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:57.791
Have you seen a lot of
action, sergeant angel?

385
00:20:57.882 --> 00:20:59.793
I've experienced
my fair share, yes.

386
00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:01.124
Did you cook any fools?

387
00:21:01.218 --> 00:21:02.378
Excuse me?

388
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:03.710
Did you shoot anybody?

389
00:21:03.804 --> 00:21:07.137
He shot a crack head
with a kalashnikov.

390
00:21:07.683 --> 00:21:08.683
Where did you get that?

391
00:21:08.726 --> 00:21:11.433
The offender had
the kalashnikov.

392
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.600
Where'd he get that?

393
00:21:12.688 --> 00:21:15.896
You do know there are more guns in the
country than there are in the city?

394
00:21:15.983 --> 00:21:19.020
Everybody and their mums
is packing round here.

395
00:21:19.653 --> 00:21:20.653
Like who?

396
00:21:20.738 --> 00:21:21.818
Farmers.

397
00:21:21.906 --> 00:21:23.112
Who else?

398
00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:24.405
Farmers's mums.

399
00:21:28.704 --> 00:21:31.491
What's it like being stabbed?

400
00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:35.457
It was the single most painful
experience of my life.

401
00:21:35.544 --> 00:21:37.910
What was the second
most painful?

402
00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:41.960
You ever fired two guns whilst
jumping through the air?

403
00:21:42.051 --> 00:21:43.166
No.

404
00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.696
You ever fired one gun whilst
jumping through the air?

405
00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.835
No.

406
00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.073
Ever been in
a high speed pursuit?

407
00:21:47.097 --> 00:21:48.212
Yes, I have.

408
00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:50.243
You ever fired a gun whilst
in a high speed pursuit?

409
00:21:50.267 --> 00:21:51.382
No.

410
00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:57.226
Amanda on walkie-talkie: Annette, that
sergeant angel's coming into your shop.

411
00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:58.977
Get a look at his arse.

412
00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:00.732
What about lethal weapon?

413
00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:01.855
No.

414
00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:02.964
You've seen die hard, though?

415
00:22:02.988 --> 00:22:04.023
No.

416
00:22:04.114 --> 00:22:05.650
Bad boys 11? No.

417
00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:07.447
You ain't seen bad boys 11?

418
00:22:11.455 --> 00:22:13.320
Hell of a day, huh? Yeah.

419
00:22:13.415 --> 00:22:14.996
Same again tomorrow? Yeah.

420
00:22:20.798 --> 00:22:24.040
Amanda paver, headmistress
of sandford primary.

421
00:22:24.134 --> 00:22:25.544
How do you do, sergeant?

422
00:22:25.636 --> 00:22:27.672
Simon Skinner,
I believe you've met.

423
00:22:27.763 --> 00:22:30.470
Oh, we're already firm friends.

424
00:22:30.558 --> 00:22:32.549
Oh, please, please,
come with me, will you?

425
00:22:32.643 --> 00:22:34.508
This is Leslie tiller,

426
00:22:34.812 --> 00:22:38.930
whose horticultural expertise has
helped put sandford on the map.

427
00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:40.226
She's ever so good.

428
00:22:40.317 --> 00:22:41.523
Oh, go on.

429
00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:44.022
This is James reaper,
who owns brannigan farm.

430
00:22:44.113 --> 00:22:45.819
I hear you're
quite the marksman.

431
00:22:45.906 --> 00:22:48.363
Perhaps you might like to
join us for a shoot one day.

432
00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:49.636
Well, I haven't held a firearm

433
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:50.991
for over two years, Mr. reaper.

434
00:22:51.078 --> 00:22:52.693
I'd quite like to
keep it that way.

435
00:22:52.788 --> 00:22:54.388
You will be popular
with the local birds.

436
00:22:55.124 --> 00:22:56.330
Birds.

437
00:22:57.084 --> 00:22:59.621
Nicholas, hello.
Reverend shooter.

438
00:23:00.087 --> 00:23:03.375
I want to ask you, would you
read a homily at Sunday service?

439
00:23:03.465 --> 00:23:05.547
That might be a little
hypocritical of me, reverend.

440
00:23:05.634 --> 00:23:07.875
Oh, you're an atheist?

441
00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:09.426
No, I'm... I'm...

442
00:23:09.513 --> 00:23:10.824
I'm open to the concept
of religion,

443
00:23:10.848 --> 00:23:12.554
I'm just not entirely
convinced by it.

444
00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:13.721
You're an agnostic?

445
00:23:13.809 --> 00:23:15.265
I think I have a cream for that.

446
00:23:17.438 --> 00:23:20.555
Robin hatcher,
our resident sawbones.

447
00:23:20.649 --> 00:23:23.561
Hopefully we won't see too much of
each other over the coming months.

448
00:23:24.445 --> 00:23:26.401
Well, all that remains
is to welcome you

449
00:23:26.488 --> 00:23:31.073
to the weekly meeting of the
neighborhood watch alliance.

450
00:23:33.537 --> 00:23:36.495
Now, quick announcement
before we begin.

451
00:23:36.874 --> 00:23:39.331
Janet barker has just
given birth to twins.

452
00:23:40.628 --> 00:23:42.664
So, congratulations to her.

453
00:23:42.755 --> 00:23:45.041
Tom? Thanks, Joyce.

454
00:23:45.633 --> 00:23:46.713
Now.

455
00:23:47.468 --> 00:23:49.299
I am sure that all of you
will have noticed

456
00:23:49.386 --> 00:23:52.423
the return of a blight
to our streets.

457
00:23:52.514 --> 00:23:53.799
It's made all the
more disturbing

458
00:23:53.891 --> 00:23:56.849
as the village of the year
contest looms.

459
00:23:57.603 --> 00:24:02.723
I refer, of course, to the extremely
irritating living statue.

460
00:24:08.072 --> 00:24:11.405
 Police work is as
much about preventing crime

461
00:24:11.492 --> 00:24:13.323
as it is about fighting crime.

462
00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:16.902
Most importantly, it is about
procedural correctness

463
00:24:16.997 --> 00:24:20.410
in the execution of
unquestionable moral authority.

464
00:24:21.543 --> 00:24:22.908
Any questions?

465
00:24:25.255 --> 00:24:26.495
Yes.

466
00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:29.297
Is it true that there is
a place in a man's head

467
00:24:29.385 --> 00:24:31.501
that if you shoot it,
it will blow up?

468
00:24:35.432 --> 00:24:36.888
Hi, hi, Tim messenger.

469
00:24:36.976 --> 00:24:39.262
Can I get a quick shot
for the sandford citizen?

470
00:24:39.353 --> 00:24:40.513
Okay.

471
00:24:40.604 --> 00:24:42.720
How about you put the
teacher in handcuffs?

472
00:24:42.815 --> 00:24:44.376
I don't think that gives
off the right signals.

473
00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.265
Too cheesy-pie. Okay. Gotcha.

474
00:24:46.694 --> 00:24:47.754
Give the little
blonde kid your hat.

475
00:24:47.778 --> 00:24:48.893
I'd rather not.

476
00:24:48.988 --> 00:24:50.090
Wave your hitting stick about.

477
00:24:50.114 --> 00:24:51.149
No.

478
00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.480
Righty-ho-ho.

479
00:24:56.996 --> 00:24:59.988
Oh, can I have your
autograph, please?

480
00:25:02.001 --> 00:25:03.491
For the breakfast.

481
00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:05.041
Oh, sorry.

482
00:25:10.009 --> 00:25:12.170
Hey, that weren't me.

483
00:25:13.429 --> 00:25:14.464
Morning, angle.

484
00:25:14.555 --> 00:25:16.011
Good morning, angle.

485
00:25:16.515 --> 00:25:17.515
 Morning, angle.

486
00:25:19.059 --> 00:25:20.924
 Morning.
The swan's escaped.

487
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.476
The swan's escaped? Yeah.

488
00:25:22.563 --> 00:25:24.770
Right. And where has the swan
escaped from exactly?

489
00:25:24.857 --> 00:25:26.768
The castle. Oh, yeah?
And who might you be?

490
00:25:26.859 --> 00:25:30.192
Mr. staker. Yeah,
Mr. Peter LAN staker.

491
00:25:30.279 --> 00:25:33.362
P. I. Staker. Right.
Piss taker. Come on!

492
00:25:33.532 --> 00:25:35.397
Yes, Mr. staker. We'll
do everything we can.

493
00:25:35.492 --> 00:25:37.357
Can you describe it to me?

494
00:25:37.453 --> 00:25:39.318
It's about two foot tall.

495
00:25:39.413 --> 00:25:40.619
Long slender neck.

496
00:25:40.706 --> 00:25:41.866
Yeah.

497
00:25:41.957 --> 00:25:43.367
Kind of orange and black bill.

498
00:25:43.459 --> 00:25:44.824
Anything else?

499
00:25:45.878 --> 00:25:47.368
Well, it's a swan.

500
00:25:55.304 --> 00:25:56.635
That's just gonna scare it.

501
00:26:02.019 --> 00:26:04.385
No luck catching
them swans then?

502
00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.812
It's just the one
swan, actually.

503
00:26:09.568 --> 00:26:10.933
Want anything from the shop?

504
00:26:11.028 --> 00:26:13.189
You've just been to the shop.

505
00:26:13.781 --> 00:26:15.317
I was thinking of
a different shop.

506
00:26:15.407 --> 00:26:17.989
Constable Butterman, this is not
the time for personal errands.

507
00:26:18.077 --> 00:26:19.179
Well, there's nothing
going on, is there?

508
00:26:19.203 --> 00:26:21.694
There is always
something going on.

509
00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:23.529
You have to look closer,
all right?

510
00:26:23.624 --> 00:26:25.535
What about this guy?

511
00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.745
Mr. treacher? Yeah.

512
00:26:27.836 --> 00:26:29.918
Why has he got that big coat on?

513
00:26:30.005 --> 00:26:31.495
He can't be cold.
Why the extra layer?

514
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.831
Maybe he's trying
to hide something.

515
00:26:34.426 --> 00:26:35.882
Mr. treacher?

516
00:26:36.845 --> 00:26:38.176
Okay. What about this guy?

517
00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:40.720
Ask yourself, why has he got
his hat pulled down like that?

518
00:26:40.808 --> 00:26:42.139
He's fuck ugly.

519
00:26:42.226 --> 00:26:44.091
Or he doesn't want you
to see his face.

520
00:26:44.186 --> 00:26:46.222
Because he's fuck ugly.

521
00:26:46.647 --> 00:26:48.387
Okay, what's his story?

522
00:26:48.482 --> 00:26:49.938
Oh, that's lurch. Go on.

523
00:26:50.025 --> 00:26:51.294
He's a trolley boy at
the local supermarket.

524
00:26:51.318 --> 00:26:52.318
Good.

525
00:26:52.402 --> 00:26:54.233
Real name, Michael Armstrong.

526
00:26:54.321 --> 00:26:55.465
Dad says he's got
a child's mind.

527
00:26:55.489 --> 00:26:56.524
Okay.

528
00:26:56.615 --> 00:26:58.775
And lives up summer street
with his mum and his sister.

529
00:26:58.826 --> 00:27:00.066
And are they as big as he is?

530
00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.160
Who?

531
00:27:01.245 --> 00:27:02.781
The mum and the sister.

532
00:27:02.871 --> 00:27:04.361
Same person.

533
00:27:05.749 --> 00:27:07.114
What shop were you thinking of?

534
00:27:29.106 --> 00:27:32.598
Tina on pa: Sergeant angel
to the manager's office.

535
00:27:32.693 --> 00:27:35.776
Manager's office.
Sergeant angel.

536
00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:42.529
Sergeant angel. Or is it angle?

537
00:27:44.371 --> 00:27:47.408
Mr. Skinner, a baby's
sicked up in aisle six.

538
00:27:48.292 --> 00:27:50.874
Please excuse me. Michael!

539
00:27:50.961 --> 00:27:52.121
Yarp.

540
00:27:52.212 --> 00:27:53.918
Child vomit. Aisle six.
Mop it up.

541
00:27:54.006 --> 00:27:55.667
Yarp.

542
00:27:55.757 --> 00:27:57.338
Mr. Skinner, is there a problem?

543
00:27:57.426 --> 00:27:58.962
No, no, no, no.

544
00:27:59.052 --> 00:28:00.713
I simply wanted to say
how lovely it is

545
00:28:00.804 --> 00:28:03.295
to see you supporting
your local store.

546
00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:04.630
Well, that's quite all right.

547
00:28:04.725 --> 00:28:08.968
All too many have defected to the
big megamart in buford Abbey.

548
00:28:09.062 --> 00:28:13.522
May their heads be struck from their
shoulders for such disloyalty.

549
00:28:13.609 --> 00:28:16.646
Yes, well, I am on duty,
so if you'll excuse me.

550
00:28:16.737 --> 00:28:20.229
Of course. I simply spied you
loitering in organic produce

551
00:28:20.324 --> 00:28:22.940
and assumed you had
time on your hands.

552
00:28:26.413 --> 00:28:28.825
Well, maybe I'm not the one you
should be keeping an eye on.

553
00:28:29.291 --> 00:28:32.158
That's the fridge magnate.
His name's George merchant.

554
00:28:32.252 --> 00:28:34.208
Made a fortune in kitchen goods.

555
00:28:34.296 --> 00:28:36.503
Built that monstrosity
on Norris Avenue.

556
00:28:37.299 --> 00:28:39.711
Actually, I wasn't
talking about him.

557
00:28:40.427 --> 00:28:42.884
I was talking about him.

558
00:28:42.971 --> 00:28:44.177
Ah.

559
00:28:44.264 --> 00:28:45.720
Excuse me.

560
00:28:48.852 --> 00:28:50.183
Excuse me.

561
00:29:02.449 --> 00:29:05.532
"Meet the cop that
can't be stopped.”

562
00:29:22.552 --> 00:29:23.792
 Tosser!

563
00:29:25.889 --> 00:29:27.379
Trouble in the high street.

564
00:29:27.474 --> 00:29:29.135
Sergeant angel's having
a spot of bother.

565
00:29:29.226 --> 00:29:30.432
Roger that.

566
00:29:40.821 --> 00:29:42.106
 Morning, sergeant.

567
00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:50.739
You mothers.

568
00:29:54.584 --> 00:29:57.075
Let's cut through here.
Head him off.

569
00:29:57.796 --> 00:29:59.206
Through the gardens?

570
00:29:59.298 --> 00:30:00.378
What's the matter, Danny?

571
00:30:00.465 --> 00:30:01.921
You never taken
a shortcut before.

572
00:30:46.178 --> 00:30:47.964
Hey, give me that!

573
00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:55.330
"You do not have
to say anything,

574
00:30:55.354 --> 00:30:56.497
"however it may
harm your defense

575
00:30:56.521 --> 00:30:57.790
"if you fail to mention
when questioned

576
00:30:57.814 --> 00:30:59.292
"something you later
rely on in court,

577
00:30:59.316 --> 00:31:01.398
"anything you do say
can be given in evidence."

578
00:31:01.485 --> 00:31:03.146
Hi, Danny. All right, Pete?

579
00:31:03.236 --> 00:31:04.351
Do you know this man?

580
00:31:04.488 --> 00:31:06.215
Yeah, he's auntie Jackie's
sister's brother's boy.

581
00:31:06.239 --> 00:31:08.176
And it didn't occur to you
to mention this before?

582
00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.440
Couldn't see his face, could 1?

583
00:31:09.493 --> 00:31:11.029
I'm not made of eyes.

584
00:31:21.671 --> 00:31:23.457
Impressive collar.

585
00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:26.085
Shame Mr. Skinner doesn't
want to press charges.

586
00:31:26.176 --> 00:31:27.695
What do you mean, he doesn't
wanna press charges?

587
00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:29.459
I'm simply suggesting that,
you know,

588
00:31:29.554 --> 00:31:31.590
Peter be given a second chance

589
00:31:31.681 --> 00:31:34.593
before he becomes just
another crime statistic.

590
00:31:34.684 --> 00:31:37.517
I'm sure he's going to learn
a valuable lesson.

591
00:31:37.604 --> 00:31:40.220
Stealing biscuits is wrong?

592
00:31:40.315 --> 00:31:41.315
Correct.

593
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.480
Thanks.

594
00:31:42.567 --> 00:31:45.434
And yet we respond by not taking
a single punitive measure?

595
00:31:45.529 --> 00:31:48.487
Well, that's the way
the cookie crumbles.

596
00:31:48.573 --> 00:31:50.484
Like the biscuits, isn't it?

597
00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:51.655
Mr. Skinner...

598
00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:53.449
Is everything all right?

599
00:31:53.578 --> 00:31:55.318
Well, sir,

600
00:31:55.414 --> 00:31:58.622
Mr. Skinner feels it would be better
not to prosecute an individual

601
00:31:58.708 --> 00:32:00.744
that has committed
a blatant offense.

602
00:32:00.877 --> 00:32:02.287
Leave this with me.

603
00:32:02.379 --> 00:32:05.542
I'll make sure everyone
gets their just deserts.

604
00:32:05.632 --> 00:32:07.543
 Oh, no!

605
00:32:10.387 --> 00:32:11.843
Twenty-seven.

606
00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:14.046
Have you ever seen point break?

607
00:32:14.141 --> 00:32:15.472
No.

608
00:32:15.559 --> 00:32:17.891
Amazing bit in point break
where they jump over fences.

609
00:32:17.978 --> 00:32:19.889
Is there now? Twenty-nine.

610
00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.561
Patrick Swayze's
just robbed this bank

611
00:32:21.648 --> 00:32:22.979
and Keanu Reeves is chasing him

612
00:32:23.066 --> 00:32:25.933
through people's gardens, and he
goes to shoot Swayze but he can't,

613
00:32:26.069 --> 00:32:27.189
'cause he loves him so much,

614
00:32:27.279 --> 00:32:29.279
and he's firing his gun up
in the air, he's like...

615
00:32:29.656 --> 00:32:30.691
Forty.

616
00:32:30.782 --> 00:32:32.902
Have you ever fired your gun
up in the air and gone...

617
00:32:33.368 --> 00:32:35.649
No, I have not ever fired my
gun up in the air and gone...

618
00:32:36.329 --> 00:32:37.785
Thirty.

619
00:32:37.914 --> 00:32:39.404
Sorry, I... I just...

620
00:32:39.499 --> 00:32:41.581
I just feel like I'm
missing out sometimes.

621
00:32:41.668 --> 00:32:42.668
I wanna do what you do.

622
00:32:42.752 --> 00:32:44.663
You do, do what I do.

623
00:32:44.754 --> 00:32:46.607
What on earth do you think
you're missing out on?

624
00:32:46.631 --> 00:32:50.089
Gun fights. Car chases.
Proper action and shit.

625
00:32:50.177 --> 00:32:53.590
Police work is not about
proper action or shit.

626
00:32:54.431 --> 00:32:55.796
Twenty-nine.

627
00:32:55.932 --> 00:32:57.285
If you had paid attention
to me in school,

628
00:32:57.309 --> 00:33:00.472
you'd understand that it's not all
about gun fights and car chases.

629
00:33:01.938 --> 00:33:03.269
Fire up the roof.

630
00:33:07.944 --> 00:33:09.605
That was brilliant.

631
00:33:12.324 --> 00:33:14.815
Was I going a tad fast, officer?

632
00:33:15.327 --> 00:33:17.409
Yes, you were, Mr. blower.

633
00:33:17.496 --> 00:33:20.738
Well, now, you see,
we are staging a homage

634
00:33:20.832 --> 00:33:22.868
to William Shakespeare's
Romeo and Juliet

635
00:33:22.959 --> 00:33:24.915
and I'm a little late
for the dress rehearsal.

636
00:33:25.003 --> 00:33:28.040
I'm playing the eponymous
hero, you see.

637
00:33:28.298 --> 00:33:29.959
Romeo not Juliet.

638
00:33:32.302 --> 00:33:33.542
What are you writing?

639
00:33:33.637 --> 00:33:34.968
Everything you're saying.

640
00:33:35.138 --> 00:33:36.503
I might need to
refer to it later.

641
00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:40.679
Now, officer, I am a respected
solicitor so there's no need fo...

642
00:33:40.894 --> 00:33:42.304
Just stop writing, will you?

643
00:33:42.395 --> 00:33:44.556
Look, I'm merely
trying to explain

644
00:33:44.648 --> 00:33:47.606
why I might have exceeded
the speed limit.

645
00:33:47.692 --> 00:33:50.479
You're playing the male lead in a
homage to William Shakespeare's

646
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:53.482
Romeo and Juliet and you're
late for the dress rehearsal.

647
00:33:53.573 --> 00:33:56.440
You think this is sufficient reason
to travel at 48 in a 30 zone?

648
00:33:56.535 --> 00:33:58.366
Well, I... to flout speed limits

649
00:33:58.495 --> 00:34:00.406
specifically put in
place to save lives.

650
00:34:00.497 --> 00:34:02.453
Just, look,
this is preposterous.

651
00:34:02.582 --> 00:34:03.947
"Preposterous.”

652
00:34:04.042 --> 00:34:06.374
Look, just stop writing!

653
00:34:06.503 --> 00:34:08.664
"Stop writi p writing.”

654
00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:14.379
Look, you're right, I apologize.

655
00:34:15.845 --> 00:34:16.960
See what I did there?

656
00:34:17.055 --> 00:34:18.135
You hypnotized him.

657
00:34:18.223 --> 00:34:19.633
No, I used this.

658
00:34:19.724 --> 00:34:22.244
This is the most important piece
of equipment you will ever own.

659
00:34:22.352 --> 00:34:23.592
This notebook has saved my skin

660
00:34:23.645 --> 00:34:25.181
more times than I
care to mention.

661
00:34:25.272 --> 00:34:26.874
You should think about
using yours more often.

662
00:34:26.898 --> 00:34:27.933
I do use mine.

663
00:34:28.024 --> 00:34:29.024
Show me.

664
00:34:34.364 --> 00:34:35.524
That's just extraordinary.

665
00:34:35.615 --> 00:34:37.401
You should see the one
on the other side.

666
00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:44.620
What are you up to tonight?

667
00:34:44.666 --> 00:34:46.497
I have to water my peace Lily.

668
00:34:46.585 --> 00:34:48.121
Thought you might
wanna do something.

669
00:34:48.211 --> 00:34:49.542
What exactly were you thinking?

670
00:34:49.629 --> 00:34:51.335
Don't know. Pub?

671
00:34:51.423 --> 00:34:54.586
I don't think that's
a good idea. Do you?

672
00:34:57.596 --> 00:34:59.086
Oil you two.

673
00:34:59.264 --> 00:35:03.633
A Mr. blower left you tickets
for Romeo and Juliet tonight.

674
00:35:03.727 --> 00:35:05.092
Said it was by way
of an apology.

675
00:35:05.186 --> 00:35:06.722
Yeah? Yeah.

676
00:35:07.147 --> 00:35:09.980
Well, we can't accept gifts from
somebody we've officially rebuked.

677
00:35:10.066 --> 00:35:11.181
So...

678
00:35:11.651 --> 00:35:12.857
Yeah.

679
00:35:14.195 --> 00:35:15.776
Nicholas. Glad I caught you.

680
00:35:15.864 --> 00:35:19.607
Wondered if you wouldn't mind
representing us at the am drams tonight.

681
00:35:19.701 --> 00:35:20.986
Yes, sir, of course.

682
00:35:21.077 --> 00:35:22.613
And there's a spare
for Danny, too.

683
00:35:22.704 --> 00:35:26.117
Yeah! Hey,
come on, it might be fun.

684
00:35:27.792 --> 00:35:31.705
A dateless bargain
to engrossing death.

685
00:35:33.214 --> 00:35:36.502
Here's to my love.

686
00:35:43.391 --> 00:35:44.551
Now.

687
00:35:49.356 --> 00:35:52.894
Poison? I'll kiss thy lips.

688
00:35:53.818 --> 00:35:56.901
Haply some poison
doth yet hang on them.

689
00:36:04.579 --> 00:36:05.694
Bang! Lc

690
00:36:24.599 --> 00:36:26.089
Sergeant angel, hi-hi.

691
00:36:26.184 --> 00:36:27.845
Quick word for the
sandford citizen.

692
00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.805
It was very enjoyable.

693
00:36:29.896 --> 00:36:31.082
"Cop enjoys watching
young lovers"?

694
00:36:31.106 --> 00:36:32.141
I don't think so.

695
00:36:32.232 --> 00:36:33.918
"Local Bobby gives thumbs
up to teen suicide"?

696
00:36:33.942 --> 00:36:35.523
That's just grossly
inappropriate.

697
00:36:36.194 --> 00:36:39.607
You will try and spell his name correctly
this time, won't you, Timothy?

698
00:36:39.698 --> 00:36:42.155
Absolute tosh, wasn't it?

699
00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:43.815
And annoyingly, the understudies

700
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:46.526
are actually
professional actors.

701
00:36:46.705 --> 00:36:49.162
Greg over there was
an extra in straw dogs

702
00:36:49.249 --> 00:36:51.129
and sheree portrayed
a cadaver in prime suspect.

703
00:36:51.209 --> 00:36:53.370
Sergeant angel, you came?

704
00:36:53.461 --> 00:36:56.828
So thrilled you accepted
my invitation.

705
00:36:56.923 --> 00:36:59.881
Well, our inspector
requested we attend. So...

706
00:36:59.968 --> 00:37:03.552
Yeah, we can't accept gifts from
someone we've officially rebuked so...

707
00:37:04.848 --> 00:37:06.179
Jog on.

708
00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:10.058
Congratulations to you
and to Mrs. blower.

709
00:37:12.313 --> 00:37:14.269
Oh, this is not my wife.

710
00:37:14.357 --> 00:37:17.099
This is miss draper.
My leading lady.

711
00:37:17.402 --> 00:37:19.768
Eve works in the local
council, sergeant.

712
00:37:19.863 --> 00:37:21.899
Quite the lady in the know.

713
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:23.275
I am not.

714
00:37:23.366 --> 00:37:24.947
Nonsense.

715
00:37:25.034 --> 00:37:27.616
I'm sure if we bashed
your head in,

716
00:37:27.704 --> 00:37:30.741
all sorts of secrets
would come tumbling out.

717
00:37:32.917 --> 00:37:37.206
Romeo, Romeo, a pint
of bitter for Romeo?

718
00:37:37.297 --> 00:37:39.233
Thank you very much for coming, George.
Excuse us.

719
00:37:39.257 --> 00:37:41.373
A pleasure, my liege.

720
00:37:41.468 --> 00:37:42.799
Eve's nice, ain't she?

721
00:37:42.886 --> 00:37:44.877
She certainly has
a distinctive laugh.

722
00:37:44.971 --> 00:37:46.632
She was in my year at school.

723
00:37:46.723 --> 00:37:48.384
Always had a thing for her.

724
00:37:49.184 --> 00:37:51.140
She clearly has
a thing for older men.

725
00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:54.556
What, with Martin blower?
No way!

726
00:37:55.064 --> 00:37:57.726
We just sat through three hours
of so-called acting, constable,

727
00:37:57.817 --> 00:38:00.559
their kiss was the only
convincing moment in it.

728
00:38:00.653 --> 00:38:02.314
Hey, now you come to mention it,

729
00:38:02.405 --> 00:38:05.021
I too have reason to believe
she favors the older gent.

730
00:38:05.116 --> 00:38:06.231
Really? How so?

731
00:38:06.326 --> 00:38:07.611
Marcus Carter's big brother said

732
00:38:07.702 --> 00:38:09.408
he'd fingered her
up the duck pond.

733
00:38:12.916 --> 00:38:14.577
Oh, officers.

734
00:38:14.667 --> 00:38:18.285
Again let me extend my Sincere
apologies for earlier.

735
00:38:18.379 --> 00:38:21.746
That's quite all right,
Mr. blower. Drive safe.

736
00:38:26.971 --> 00:38:30.134
"Drive safe." Oh, my god.

737
00:38:30.225 --> 00:38:32.591
You know that's the bloke
we done for speeding earlier.

738
00:38:32.685 --> 00:38:35.597
Yeah. Hopefully, that's the
last we'll see of him.

739
00:38:47.951 --> 00:38:49.282
Who is it?

740
00:38:53.873 --> 00:38:54.988
We haven't got long.

741
00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.166
To us.

742
00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:01.620
Who is it?

743
00:39:13.518 --> 00:39:14.849
Yeah?

744
00:39:17.689 --> 00:39:19.600
Decaffeinated? Decaffeinated?

745
00:39:24.153 --> 00:39:27.236
Little Brian Libby found them,
out on his paper round.

746
00:39:28.032 --> 00:39:30.865
Oh, he'll be having
nightmares for a while.

747
00:39:31.327 --> 00:39:33.534
Must have hit the sign
at some speed.

748
00:39:33.621 --> 00:39:35.236
Took the whole top off.

749
00:39:35.331 --> 00:39:37.162
I've had my top off
in this lay-by.

750
00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:38.410
Tits.

751
00:39:38.501 --> 00:39:44.997
Most likely lost control, left the
road there and then ended up here.

752
00:39:46.676 --> 00:39:51.010
So, what do we reckon?

753
00:39:51.848 --> 00:39:53.258
Sergeant angel?

754
00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:55.202
Well, we should get
a proper cordon off,

755
00:39:55.226 --> 00:39:56.682
screen the remains
from public view.

756
00:39:56.769 --> 00:39:58.539
Close down the road until
the ambulance crew arrives,

757
00:39:58.563 --> 00:40:01.896
whereupon we should open a single
Lane of traffic and ease congestion.

758
00:40:02.442 --> 00:40:03.773
Very good.

759
00:40:04.444 --> 00:40:05.524
What he said.

760
00:40:10.909 --> 00:40:11.944
What happened, Danny?

761
00:40:12.035 --> 00:40:13.035
Car accident.

762
00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:14.859
Nasty way to go.

763
00:40:15.705 --> 00:40:17.696
Constable, official
vocab guidelines state

764
00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:19.685
we no longer refer to these
incidents as "accidents,"

765
00:40:19.709 --> 00:40:20.869
they're now “collisions.”

766
00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.040
Right.

767
00:40:22.128 --> 00:40:24.961
"For never was there
a story of more woe.

768
00:40:25.048 --> 00:40:28.256
"Than this of Juliet
and her Romeo.”

769
00:40:28.551 --> 00:40:29.666
Excuse me?

770
00:40:29.761 --> 00:40:32.218
Martin and Eve. Such a tragedy.

771
00:40:32.305 --> 00:40:33.886
Mr. Skinner,
do you mind telling me

772
00:40:33.973 --> 00:40:36.180
how you know the identity
of the persons involved?

773
00:40:36.267 --> 00:40:39.725
You know how it is.
News travels fast.

774
00:40:41.064 --> 00:40:44.227
A love struck Romeo
sings a streetsus serenade

775
00:40:44.734 --> 00:40:45.849
what happened, Danny?

776
00:40:45.944 --> 00:40:47.059
Traffic collision.

777
00:40:48.321 --> 00:40:50.232
Hey, why can't we say
"accident" again?

778
00:40:50.323 --> 00:40:52.780
Because "accident" implies
there's nobody to blame.

779
00:40:54.285 --> 00:40:55.695
Put a sock in it, town mouse.

780
00:40:55.787 --> 00:40:57.573
Yeah, you wanna be
a big cop in a small town,

781
00:40:57.664 --> 00:40:59.529
fuck off up the model village.

782
00:40:59.624 --> 00:41:02.036
I'm just saying, things aren't
always as simple as they look.

783
00:41:02.126 --> 00:41:03.957
Most times they are.

784
00:41:04.087 --> 00:41:06.794
Let's just wait till doctor hatcher
comes back with something,

785
00:41:06.923 --> 00:41:08.403
before you go jumping
the kalashnikov.

786
00:41:09.592 --> 00:41:12.738
All right, in the meantime, why don't you
check out a few of Martin blower's clients?

787
00:41:12.762 --> 00:41:15.629
Martin blower represents damn
near most of the village.

788
00:41:15.765 --> 00:41:17.326
Did you want us to go through
the whole phone book?

789
00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:20.137
Yeah, or put a call into Aaron a.
Aaronson, shall we?

790
00:41:20.269 --> 00:41:21.554
Please, don't be childish.

791
00:41:21.646 --> 00:41:22.998
At least consider
interviewing the widow.

792
00:41:23.022 --> 00:41:25.167
Martin blower was clearly having
an affair with Eve draper.

793
00:41:25.191 --> 00:41:28.604
Oh, and how did you
establish that?

794
00:41:28.695 --> 00:41:31.437
'Cause we sat through three hours
of so-called acting last night,

795
00:41:31.531 --> 00:41:33.943
and the kiss was the only
convincing moment in it.

796
00:41:34.033 --> 00:41:36.115
All right, pipe down, big one.

797
00:41:36.202 --> 00:41:38.739
Here, what else you got,
Crockett and tubby?

798
00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:39.830
Skid marks.

799
00:41:39.914 --> 00:41:41.308
Now who's being childish?

800
00:41:41.332 --> 00:41:43.163
There were no skid marks
at the scene.

801
00:41:43.292 --> 00:41:44.311
Doesn't it seem a little strange

802
00:41:44.335 --> 00:41:46.215
that Martin blower would
lose control of his car

803
00:41:46.295 --> 00:41:48.206
and not think to
apply the brakes?

804
00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:50.192
If there were no
skid marks it follows

805
00:41:50.216 --> 00:41:52.172
that for 300 yards
both driver and passenger

806
00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:54.125
did nothing to
prevent their fate.

807
00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:56.211
You don't have to be a
detective to work that out!

808
00:41:56.305 --> 00:41:57.465
Yeah.

809
00:41:57.557 --> 00:41:59.047
Are you causing trouble?

810
00:41:59.142 --> 00:42:00.632
Yes, they are.

811
00:42:00.727 --> 00:42:03.935
Well, a spot of bother
up at ellroy farm.

812
00:42:04.022 --> 00:42:07.514
Old Arthur webley's been clipping
hedgerows that don't belong to him.

813
00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:09.311
Th n yi qq ~, 1! Y-
that's it. Es, sir?

814
00:42:10.319 --> 00:42:11.650
Yes, sir.

815
00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:19.071
Why do we need the dog?

816
00:42:19.162 --> 00:42:20.743
It's not the dog we need.

817
00:42:28.504 --> 00:42:29.584
Right.

818
00:42:29.672 --> 00:42:30.787
What did he say?

819
00:42:36.679 --> 00:42:38.407
What did he say? He said,
"an 'edge is an 'edge.

820
00:42:38.431 --> 00:42:40.075
"He only chopped it down
'cause it spoilt his view.

821
00:42:40.099 --> 00:42:41.509
"What's reaper moaning about?"

822
00:42:41.601 --> 00:42:42.681
Right.

823
00:42:42.769 --> 00:42:44.163
Look, I appreciate your
position, Mr. webley,

824
00:42:44.187 --> 00:42:45.998
but you can't go around chopping
down other people's hedges

825
00:42:46.022 --> 00:42:47.102
without permission.

826
00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.731
"Yes, I suppose.”

827
00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:51.940
Thank you.

828
00:42:52.695 --> 00:42:54.185
All right.

829
00:42:55.865 --> 00:42:58.698
Mr. webley, I trust you have
a license for that firearm?

830
00:43:01.079 --> 00:43:02.694
He does for this one.

831
00:43:04.415 --> 00:43:05.871
What do you mean by "this one"?

832
00:43:19.472 --> 00:43:22.134
By the power of gray skull.

833
00:43:22.225 --> 00:43:24.181
Where on earth
did you get these?

834
00:43:24.268 --> 00:43:26.179
Found them. He found them!

835
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:28.352
And what is this?

836
00:43:28.439 --> 00:43:29.849
Sea mine.

837
00:43:29.941 --> 00:43:31.477
Sea mine.

838
00:43:31.734 --> 00:43:34.271
Well, Mr. webley, this is an
extremely dangerous collection.

839
00:43:34.403 --> 00:43:35.923
It's a wonder nobody's
been hurt before.

840
00:43:35.947 --> 00:43:37.938
No, it's just a lot of junk.

841
00:43:50.128 --> 00:43:52.244
 Move, move, move!

842
00:44:13.192 --> 00:44:14.192
Turner: You what?

843
00:44:14.277 --> 00:44:16.063
No, apparently its
been deactivated. Over.

844
00:44:16.154 --> 00:44:18.236
That's right, deactivated!

845
00:44:18.322 --> 00:44:20.233
It's not live. It looks live.

846
00:44:20.324 --> 00:44:21.439
All right.

847
00:44:44.473 --> 00:44:46.827
That was quite an impressive
haul today, constable Butterman.

848
00:44:46.851 --> 00:44:50.264
Well, you know, I mean, maybe we
should do something to celebrate.

849
00:44:50.354 --> 00:44:51.832
Unless you gotta water
your peace Lily.

850
00:44:51.856 --> 00:44:53.167
What exactly did
you have in mind?

851
00:44:53.191 --> 00:44:55.227
I don't know. Pub?

852
00:44:59.989 --> 00:45:02.571
 Right you are, my love.

853
00:45:02.658 --> 00:45:04.740
Yes, sirs, what can I get you?

854
00:45:04.827 --> 00:45:06.408
Pint of lager, please, Roy.

855
00:45:06.495 --> 00:45:08.182
And what can I get you that
isn't a cranberry juice?

856
00:45:08.206 --> 00:45:09.446
I don't really wanna get drunk.

857
00:45:09.498 --> 00:45:10.863
You can get a little drunk.

858
00:45:10.958 --> 00:45:11.958
Okay, I'll have one.

859
00:45:12.001 --> 00:45:13.616
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

860
00:45:14.003 --> 00:45:15.959
Mr. Porter, what's
your wine selection?

861
00:45:16.047 --> 00:45:20.666
Oh, we got red or white.

862
00:45:21.886 --> 00:45:23.251
I'll have a pint
of lager, please.

863
00:45:23.346 --> 00:45:25.007
Yeah, Roy.

864
00:45:30.144 --> 00:45:31.554
Any news from earlier?

865
00:45:31.646 --> 00:45:34.433
Yeah. CSI found nothing.

866
00:45:34.523 --> 00:45:36.730
Doctor hatcher reported
no misadventure

867
00:45:36.817 --> 00:45:38.978
and Mrs. blower has four alibis.

868
00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:41.231
Now, come on, sergeant,

869
00:45:42.114 --> 00:45:45.026
it's not your job to investigate
this incident, is it?

870
00:45:45.868 --> 00:45:46.983
Ils it?

871
00:45:47.078 --> 00:45:49.535
 No, it isn't.

872
00:45:52.083 --> 00:45:53.698
You don't switch off, do you?

873
00:45:53.793 --> 00:45:55.374
You sound like my ex.

874
00:45:56.003 --> 00:45:57.743
Well, you are always
thinking away.

875
00:45:57.838 --> 00:45:59.499
It's what I do.

876
00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:01.626
Don't get me wrong.
I think it's amazing.

877
00:46:01.717 --> 00:46:03.002
Really?

878
00:46:03.094 --> 00:46:05.710
I mean, what made you
wanna be a policeman?

879
00:46:05.846 --> 00:46:06.881
Officer.

880
00:46:07.014 --> 00:46:09.551
What made you wanna be
a policeman-officer?

881
00:46:12.103 --> 00:46:15.516
I don't remember a time when I
didn't wanna be a police officer.

882
00:46:15.606 --> 00:46:19.394
Apart from the summer of 1979 when
I wanted to be Kermit the frog.

883
00:46:22.446 --> 00:46:24.357
He was a sergeant in the met.

884
00:46:24.448 --> 00:46:27.360
He bought me a police pedal
car when I was five.

885
00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:29.567
I rode round in it
every second I was awake.

886
00:46:29.704 --> 00:46:33.037
Arresting kids twice my size
for littering and spitting.

887
00:46:33.124 --> 00:46:36.207
I got beaten up a lot when I was
young but it didn't stop me.

888
00:46:36.294 --> 00:46:38.205
I wanted to be like uncle Derek.

889
00:46:38.296 --> 00:46:39.416
He sounds like a good bloke.

890
00:46:39.463 --> 00:46:41.795
Actually, he was arrested for
selling drugs to students.

891
00:46:41.924 --> 00:46:43.004
What a cunt.

892
00:46:43.092 --> 00:46:45.504
Probably bought the pedal
car with the proceeds.

893
00:46:45.594 --> 00:46:47.505
Needless to say I never
went near it again.

894
00:46:47.596 --> 00:46:48.881
I just let it rust.

895
00:46:48.973 --> 00:46:51.053
But I never forgot the clear
sense of right and wrong

896
00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:53.091
that I felt at the wheel
of that pedal car.

897
00:46:53.227 --> 00:46:55.809
I had to prove to myself
that the law could be proper

898
00:46:55.938 --> 00:46:58.270
and righteous and for
the good of humankind.

899
00:46:58.399 --> 00:47:01.983
It was from that moment, I was
destined to be a police officer.

900
00:47:02.445 --> 00:47:03.480
Shame.

901
00:47:03.571 --> 00:47:04.651
How so?

902
00:47:04.739 --> 00:47:07.276
I think you would've
made a great muppet.

903
00:47:10.911 --> 00:47:13.778
What about you? What made you
wanna become a police officer?

904
00:47:14.123 --> 00:47:17.206
I don't know. Dad does it.

905
00:47:17.293 --> 00:47:19.705
I think after my mum died,
it's what he wanted, you know,

906
00:47:19.795 --> 00:47:21.501
keep me close by.

907
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:23.750
Do you mind if I ask
how she died?

908
00:47:23.841 --> 00:47:25.581
Traffic collision.

909
00:47:26.385 --> 00:47:27.750
I'm I s orry

910
00:47:28.929 --> 00:47:31.136
never mind. Hey, watch this.

911
00:47:32.475 --> 00:47:33.635
Jesus Christ!

912
00:47:33.726 --> 00:47:34.886
Oh, my eye!

913
00:47:36.562 --> 00:47:37.722
Ta-da!

914
00:47:37.813 --> 00:47:39.644
Hey, come on, silly bollocks,
get them in.

915
00:47:51.994 --> 00:47:53.359
177.

916
00:47:53.454 --> 00:47:54.739
Mr. Skinner.

917
00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:56.183
You know George merchant,
don't you?

918
00:47:56.207 --> 00:47:57.413
Evening, officer.

919
00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:00.412
Yes, we were just
discussing the accident.

920
00:48:00.503 --> 00:48:03.916
I'd come to know Martin
and Eve very well of late.

921
00:48:04.006 --> 00:48:05.587
Such a loss.

922
00:48:05.674 --> 00:48:08.086
What say we drink
to their demise?

923
00:48:08.177 --> 00:48:09.821
Shouldn't that be
"drink to their memories"?

924
00:48:09.845 --> 00:48:12.086
Of course. Cheers.

925
00:48:12.181 --> 00:48:14.012
I must go to the
little boys' room.

926
00:48:15.351 --> 00:48:16.431
George: I'm all right!

927
00:48:16.519 --> 00:48:18.134
“Little” being
the operative word.

928
00:48:18.687 --> 00:48:21.303
Oh, he'll be in bits tomorrow.

929
00:48:30.116 --> 00:48:32.778
I think somebody
needs to go home.

930
00:48:32.868 --> 00:48:34.529
I'm... I'm not that drunk, sir.

931
00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:36.611
Not you. Him.

932
00:48:38.707 --> 00:48:40.038
What?

933
00:48:41.335 --> 00:48:45.203
Hey, we did get a little drunk.
Did you get it?

934
00:48:45.297 --> 00:48:48.004
'Cause he's... he's
little and he's drunk.

935
00:48:49.844 --> 00:48:51.709
Oh, good grief.

936
00:48:52.054 --> 00:48:55.046
It's hardly in keeping with the
village's rustic aesthetic, is it?

937
00:48:56.892 --> 00:48:58.132
How much do I owe you?

938
00:48:58.227 --> 00:48:59.387
Twenty quid.

939
00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.511
There you go.

940
00:49:02.022 --> 00:49:03.102
And there's your change.

941
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:04.270
God bless you.

942
00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:06.140
Bye-bye.

943
00:49:09.196 --> 00:49:10.732
I'm all right.

944
00:49:12.825 --> 00:49:13.940
Oh, dear.

945
00:49:14.034 --> 00:49:15.865
I would not wanna be
him in the morning.

946
00:49:26.755 --> 00:49:29.838
Well, this is me.

947
00:49:30.426 --> 00:49:34.169
Well, I shall see you
in the morning.

948
00:49:34.263 --> 00:49:37.096
Unless you wanna come in
for a cup of coffee?

949
00:49:37.224 --> 00:49:38.509
I don't drink coffee.

950
00:49:38.601 --> 00:49:39.841
Tea?

951
00:49:39.935 --> 00:49:42.017
No caffeine after midday.

952
00:49:42.771 --> 00:49:44.602
How about another beer?

953
00:49:52.364 --> 00:49:53.524
Oh, dear.

954
00:49:59.872 --> 00:50:01.362
When did you move in?

955
00:50:01.457 --> 00:50:03.197
About five years ago.

956
00:50:04.418 --> 00:50:05.703
You should get
some house plants.

957
00:50:05.794 --> 00:50:07.125
Oh, yeah, yeah.

958
00:50:07.213 --> 00:50:10.046
Yeah. I've been tending my peace
Lily for about three years now.

959
00:50:11.634 --> 00:50:15.172
It oxygenates the room, helps
you think, relieves stress.

960
00:50:15.262 --> 00:50:17.093
Its needs are simple.

961
00:50:21.393 --> 00:50:24.556
Janine used to say I love my
Lily more than I loved her.

962
00:50:24.647 --> 00:50:25.978
Is that why you split up?

963
00:50:26.065 --> 00:50:27.145
What?

964
00:50:27.816 --> 00:50:29.898
'Cause you did it with a plant?

965
00:50:29.985 --> 00:50:31.225
No, no, no.

966
00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:34.858
It was more about me being
obsessed with the job.

967
00:50:35.157 --> 00:50:37.489
That's good though, right?

968
00:50:37.993 --> 00:50:39.449
Is it though?

969
00:50:39.537 --> 00:50:41.744
I did miss a few dinners.

970
00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:44.742
You know, parties,
a birthday or two.

971
00:50:44.917 --> 00:50:46.077
Listen, mate, I...

972
00:50:46.168 --> 00:50:47.954
Her dad's funeral.

973
00:50:49.088 --> 00:50:51.329
I just wanna be good
at what I do.

974
00:50:51.423 --> 00:50:53.539
You are good at what you do.

975
00:50:55.094 --> 00:50:59.428
You've just gotta learn to switch
off that big old melon of yours.

976
00:51:01.475 --> 00:51:03.557
That's the whole problem, Danny.

977
00:51:06.939 --> 00:51:08.930
I don't think I know how.

978
00:51:09.858 --> 00:51:11.849
I can show you how.

979
00:51:17.866 --> 00:51:20.528
By the power of gray skull.

980
00:51:21.287 --> 00:51:23.699
Point break or bad boys 1?

981
00:51:23.789 --> 00:51:25.149
Which one do you
think I'll prefer?

982
00:51:25.207 --> 00:51:27.323
No, I mean which one
do you wanna watch first?

983
00:51:27.418 --> 00:51:28.624
You are pulling my leg?

984
00:52:09.668 --> 00:52:11.659
What did you think of that?

985
00:52:11.754 --> 00:52:14.541
Well, I won't argue that
it was a no holds barred,

986
00:52:14.632 --> 00:52:17.669
adrenalin fuelled thrill ride but
there's no way you could perpetrate

987
00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:19.125
that amount of carnage
and mayhem

988
00:52:19.219 --> 00:52:22.006
and not incur a considerable
amount of paperwork.

989
00:52:22.097 --> 00:52:23.428
That is nothing, man.

990
00:52:23.557 --> 00:52:25.218
This is about to go off.

991
00:52:41.283 --> 00:52:42.898
This shit just got real.

992
00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:48.570
Hatcher: Nasty way to go.

993
00:52:48.666 --> 00:52:52.659
I think our Mr. merchant tried to have
a little fry up and left the gas on.

994
00:52:54.505 --> 00:52:57.668
Spends his whole life
devoted to the refrigerator

995
00:52:57.925 --> 00:53:00.291
then gets killed by an oven.

996
00:53:01.303 --> 00:53:04.591
I told him several times, you
shouldn't eat late at night.

997
00:53:04.682 --> 00:53:07.594
Oh, I don't know. I quite like
a little midnight gobble.

998
00:53:07.685 --> 00:53:08.891
Cocks.

999
00:53:08.977 --> 00:53:12.640
So, what do we reckon? Angel?

1000
00:53:13.982 --> 00:53:15.097
Help me.

1001
00:53:15.651 --> 00:53:17.061
Okay, we get a proper cordon up,

1002
00:53:17.152 --> 00:53:19.188
we let the fire crews
finish their stuff,

1003
00:53:19.279 --> 00:53:22.021
and then we get forensics in to
do a thorough sweep of the house.

1004
00:53:22.116 --> 00:53:24.823
Very good. What he said.

1005
00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:27.026
Sergeant angel, hi-hi.
A quick word?

1006
00:53:27.121 --> 00:53:29.453
Mr. messenger, a statement
will be issued shortly.

1007
00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:30.642
Actually, I just wanted to ask,

1008
00:53:30.666 --> 00:53:32.202
"what's your perfect Sunday?”

1009
00:53:32.292 --> 00:53:34.658
I'll deal with the
press, sergeant.

1010
00:53:34.753 --> 00:53:39.247
Now, my perfect Sunday
is a lovely long lie in...

1011
00:53:40.509 --> 00:53:45.128
Fire to destroy all you've done

1012
00:53:49.268 --> 00:53:50.548
man on radio: Like in the films.

1013
00:53:50.978 --> 00:53:53.685
Something like,
something out of backdraft.

1014
00:53:55.524 --> 00:53:57.515
What are you thinking?
Foul play?

1015
00:53:57.609 --> 00:53:59.190
 Maybe.

1016
00:53:59.278 --> 00:54:02.862
We're just hoping to talk to the last
people to see Mr. merchant alive.

1017
00:54:03.282 --> 00:54:05.773
Namely a sergeant
knickerless asswipe

1018
00:54:05.868 --> 00:54:08.359
and a constable Fanny batterbum.

1019
00:54:08.454 --> 00:54:09.454
That's us.

1020
00:54:09.538 --> 00:54:11.369
Why is this such
a big joke to you?

1021
00:54:11.457 --> 00:54:12.913
Three people have
died in a week.

1022
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.616
Oh, come on, doctor Sherlock,
they were accidents.

1023
00:54:15.711 --> 00:54:17.201
People have accidents every day.

1024
00:54:17.296 --> 00:54:18.627
The victims knew each other.

1025
00:54:18.714 --> 00:54:20.204
Everyone knows everyone
round here.

1026
00:54:20.299 --> 00:54:23.541
Yeah. If you didn't see anything
suspicious, then who did?

1027
00:54:28.891 --> 00:54:30.802
It's a bit of a blind spot,
I'm afraid.

1028
00:54:30.893 --> 00:54:33.134
We just catch the very edge
of the explosion.

1029
00:54:33.228 --> 00:54:35.059
Nasty way to go.

1030
00:54:35.147 --> 00:54:36.432
There was something took my eye.

1031
00:54:36.523 --> 00:54:37.729
Really? What's that?

1032
00:54:38.567 --> 00:54:40.774
Sandford's most wanted.

1033
00:54:42.654 --> 00:54:45.020
There you go. It was
the swan all along.

1034
00:54:45.115 --> 00:54:46.571
This is not funny, detective!

1035
00:54:46.658 --> 00:54:48.398
Oh, give over, miss marples.

1036
00:54:48.494 --> 00:54:50.906
Yeah, you do your job
and we'll do ours, eh?

1037
00:54:50.996 --> 00:54:53.237
Yeah. Haven't you got a
church fete to look after?

1038
00:54:53.332 --> 00:54:55.288
No, I have not!

1039
00:54:56.251 --> 00:54:57.411
Actually.

1040
00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:00.331
Reverend shooter:
Testing. Testing.

1041
00:55:00.422 --> 00:55:03.459
Someone's in for a surprise at
3:00, ladies and gentlemen.

1042
00:55:03.884 --> 00:55:07.502
It's the raffle with a very
special guest presenter.

1043
00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:10.420
Out in the country

1044
00:55:10.516 --> 00:55:14.429
far from all the sorts
of noise of the city

1045
00:55:14.603 --> 00:55:17.094
there's a village green

1046
00:55:17.189 --> 00:55:21.057
it's been a long time
since I last set eyes

1047
00:55:21.151 --> 00:55:23.267
on the church with a steeple

1048
00:55:23.362 --> 00:55:25.569
that's me after
a couple of pints.

1049
00:55:25.739 --> 00:55:27.104
Skinner: Splat the rat.

1050
00:55:29.743 --> 00:55:31.483
Splat the rat.

1051
00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:35.616
Splat the rat.

1052
00:55:37.751 --> 00:55:39.287
Shark!

1053
00:55:41.129 --> 00:55:43.085
Seen any murderings, nicholarse?

1054
00:55:43.173 --> 00:55:45.789
Come on, boys. Leave sergeant
angel alone, he's working.

1055
00:55:45.884 --> 00:55:49.342
Sorry, chief, won't waste
any more police time.

1056
00:55:49.429 --> 00:55:50.635
Have a nice time.

1057
00:55:50.722 --> 00:55:53.134
Actually, Nicholas, you
might as well take a break.

1058
00:55:53.225 --> 00:55:56.012
Hey, great. I've got
something to show you.

1059
00:56:01.984 --> 00:56:03.224
This is a rifle range.

1060
00:56:03.318 --> 00:56:04.933
You'll be really good at it.

1061
00:56:05.028 --> 00:56:07.485
Feeling lucky, sergeant?

1062
00:56:08.323 --> 00:56:10.405
Three cans wins you
the squeaky bunny,

1063
00:56:10.492 --> 00:56:12.949
five cans gets you
the floppy lion.

1064
00:56:13.036 --> 00:56:15.152
Take out all the little people,

1065
00:56:15.247 --> 00:56:18.114
you get to waltz off
with the cuddly monkey.

1066
00:56:19.251 --> 00:56:22.664
I thought I made it clear to
you how I feel about firearms.

1067
00:56:22.754 --> 00:56:25.086
It's only an air rifle.

1068
00:56:25.382 --> 00:56:26.542
Sergeant.

1069
00:56:45.193 --> 00:56:46.899
Dear lord!

1070
00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:50.362
That was amazing.

1071
00:56:54.828 --> 00:56:56.284
Thank you, Danny.

1072
00:56:56.371 --> 00:56:57.736
I can't believe I shot someone.

1073
00:56:57.831 --> 00:56:59.287
He's a doctor,
he can deal with it.

1074
00:56:59.374 --> 00:57:01.080
I never shot anyone before.

1075
00:57:01.168 --> 00:57:03.438
Danny, believe me, it's not
something you ever get used to.

1076
00:57:03.462 --> 00:57:05.703
Yeah. Maybe we should
go on the bouncy castle.

1077
00:57:05.797 --> 00:57:06.877
Take our minds off of it.

1078
00:57:06.965 --> 00:57:08.876
Sergeant angel, hi-hi.
Mr. messenger.

1079
00:57:08.967 --> 00:57:11.583
I need to talk to you about
George merchant. Alone.

1080
00:57:12.054 --> 00:57:14.295
Churchyard. 3:00.

1081
00:57:15.974 --> 00:57:17.089
What do you think he wants?

1082
00:57:17.184 --> 00:57:20.221
Reverend shooter: Would sergeant
angel come to the stage, please?

1083
00:57:23.273 --> 00:57:27.232
Here to announce the winners is the newest
addition to the sandford police force.

1084
00:57:27.319 --> 00:57:28.434
Service.

1085
00:57:28.528 --> 00:57:30.268
Sergeant Nicholas angel.

1086
00:57:32.824 --> 00:57:34.109
Wanker.

1087
00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:37.571
Hello. Hello.

1088
00:57:54.638 --> 00:57:59.257
The first name is Simon Skinner:

1089
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:03.806
He's in the loo.

1090
00:58:04.564 --> 00:58:06.930
Too much of Joyce's
lemonade, perhaps.

1091
00:58:29.297 --> 00:58:31.709
And the next name is...

1092
00:58:35.679 --> 00:58:37.294
Tim messenger.

1093
00:58:47.149 --> 00:58:49.060
Tim, your number's up.

1094
00:58:58.493 --> 00:59:00.154
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1095
00:59:02.664 --> 00:59:03.824
Hi-=-hi.

1096
00:59:08.336 --> 00:59:09.667
Oh, no!

1097
00:59:15.010 --> 00:59:16.125
Stand back, stand back!

1098
00:59:16.219 --> 00:59:17.880
There's been
a terrible accident.

1099
00:59:18.013 --> 00:59:19.298
Accident?

1100
00:59:19.389 --> 00:59:20.674
Just an accident.

1101
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:24.056
It's all right, it's all right.
There's nothing to see.

1102
00:59:24.186 --> 00:59:28.020
Come on, everybody. It's all right.
It's just an accident.

1103
00:59:36.698 --> 00:59:38.313
 Nicholas, what is it?

1104
00:59:38.408 --> 00:59:40.194
Sir, I think all these
deaths are linked.

1105
00:59:40.285 --> 00:59:42.446
I think Tim messenger
was murdered.

1106
00:59:42.871 --> 00:59:44.452
Who could do
something like this?

1107
00:59:44.539 --> 00:59:46.029
Maybe it was the swan.

1108
00:59:46.124 --> 00:59:47.644
Apparently, they can
break a man's arm.

1109
00:59:47.709 --> 00:59:49.199
Or blow up a man's house.

1110
00:59:49.294 --> 00:59:50.294
Listen, you pair of...

1111
00:59:50.378 --> 00:59:52.243
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, Nicholas.

1112
00:59:52.756 --> 00:59:55.088
Now, let me get this straight.

1113
00:59:56.093 --> 00:59:58.459
Are you saying that
this is a erime scene?

1114
00:59:58.553 --> 01:00:00.134
Yes, sir, I am.

1115
01:00:00.222 --> 01:00:01.553
Very well.

1116
01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:03.179
Detectives.

1117
01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:04.911
Start interviewing everyone
who was at the fete.

1118
01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:06.015
Oh, he's got shorts on.

1119
01:00:06.103 --> 01:00:07.218
Sergeant Fisher? What?

1120
01:00:07.312 --> 01:00:08.722
Secure the area. What?

1121
01:00:08.814 --> 01:00:10.020
PC Thatcher? Yes, love?

1122
01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:11.722
Get the CSI down here.

1123
01:00:11.817 --> 01:00:13.023
PC Walker?

1124
01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:15.396
Patrol the churchyard
with Saxon.

1125
01:00:15.487 --> 01:00:18.729
Nicholas, Danny,
you know what to do.

1126
01:00:24.996 --> 01:00:27.157
Do you really think
this is murder?

1127
01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:28.976
I just don't think we should
rule it out, that's all.

1128
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.490
Yeah. I think you're right.

1129
01:00:30.585 --> 01:00:32.826
I think you're talking
a load of old shit.

1130
01:00:33.588 --> 01:00:35.169
He thinks you're
talking a load of shit.

1131
01:00:35.257 --> 01:00:36.793
Swings and roundabouts,
isn't it?

1132
01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:38.419
Cartwright: Pain in the arse.

1133
01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:40.671
Did you find anything? Yeah.

1134
01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:42.657
I was extremely shocked
when I looked at my watch

1135
01:00:42.681 --> 01:00:44.158
and discovered that
I should be in the pub.

1136
01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:46.468
Did you go to his house?
Did you read his articles?

1137
01:00:46.601 --> 01:00:47.745
If you wanna Wade
through every copy

1138
01:00:47.769 --> 01:00:50.010
of the sandford bloody
citizen, be our guest.

1139
01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:52.016
It's your job, isn't it? Detect!

1140
01:00:52.107 --> 01:00:54.189
This ain't the city, Mr. angel.

1141
01:00:54.276 --> 01:00:56.358
Not everyone's
a murdering psychopath.

1142
01:00:56.528 --> 01:00:58.143
It's high time
you realized that.

1143
01:00:58.238 --> 01:00:59.899
You and your monkey.

1144
01:01:03.285 --> 01:01:05.276
Did he mean me or that?

1145
01:01:06.955 --> 01:01:09.116
Oh, maybe we should go home.

1146
01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:10.367
What do you mean?

1147
01:01:10.458 --> 01:01:12.414
Well, there's nothing
going on, is there?

1148
01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:14.188
Have you listened to
anything that I've said?

1149
01:01:14.212 --> 01:01:15.327
What do you mean?

1150
01:01:15.463 --> 01:01:17.024
Is anything I've told you
in the last two weeks

1151
01:01:17.048 --> 01:01:18.109
sunk into that thick
skull of yours?

1152
01:01:18.133 --> 01:01:19.133
Yeah.

1153
01:01:19.217 --> 01:01:20.923
Has it? Like what?

1154
01:01:21.469 --> 01:01:23.389
You said I could be an
amazing policeman-officer.

1155
01:01:23.471 --> 01:01:25.837
There's always something
going on, Danny.

1156
01:01:25.974 --> 01:01:29.558
And you won't be an amazing police
officer until you understand that.

1157
01:01:29.644 --> 01:01:32.010
Well, I remembered something
else you said and all.

1158
01:01:32.147 --> 01:01:33.728
Oh, did you now? Yeah.

1159
01:01:33.815 --> 01:01:36.147
You don't know
how to switch off!

1160
01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:11.829
Cartwright: Well, if you wanna
Wade through every copy

1161
01:02:11.853 --> 01:02:14.185
of the sandford bloody
citizen, be our guest.

1162
01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:53.053
Morning, constable.

1163
01:02:53.144 --> 01:02:54.384
All right?

1164
01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:57.595
Thanks for the monkey.

1165
01:02:58.441 --> 01:02:59.556
Yours, isn't it?

1166
01:02:59.651 --> 01:03:00.982
I won it for you.

1167
01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:06.570
Danny, I think
I'm on to something.

1168
01:03:06.658 --> 01:03:07.818
Are you? Yes.

1169
01:03:07.909 --> 01:03:09.615
And I think with
a little deliberation

1170
01:03:09.703 --> 01:03:12.285
we can figure out
what links these deaths.

1171
01:03:12.747 --> 01:03:13.827
We?

1172
01:03:13.915 --> 01:03:16.122
Come on, partner.
Let's go to work.

1173
01:03:17.252 --> 01:03:19.163
Oh, oh, sergeant angel?

1174
01:03:19.254 --> 01:03:22.121
Someone from London
called for you.

1175
01:03:22.215 --> 01:03:23.921
Tell them I'll call them back.

1176
01:03:24.759 --> 01:03:25.839
Tim messenger. Go.

1177
01:03:25.927 --> 01:03:27.758
Editor and journalist
at the sandford citizen.

1178
01:03:27.846 --> 01:03:29.131
Fondness for puns. Go on.

1179
01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:30.344
Terrible speller. Oh, yeah?

1180
01:03:30.432 --> 01:03:32.451
Nevertheless had uncovered
important information about...

1181
01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:34.215
George merchant.
Self-made millionaire.

1182
01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:36.518
Fancied himself as
a property developer.

1183
01:03:36.604 --> 01:03:37.873
Said he had big plans
for sandford.

1184
01:03:37.897 --> 01:03:39.353
Pissed on the floor
in the crown.

1185
01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:41.641
But more importantly, was a
good friend and client of...

1186
01:03:41.693 --> 01:03:43.433
Martin blower.
Respected solicitor.

1187
01:03:43.528 --> 01:03:44.528
Affirmatron.

1188
01:03:44.612 --> 01:03:45.840
Leading light of the
local drama society.

1189
01:03:45.864 --> 01:03:47.274
Bad actor. Undoubtedly.

1190
01:03:47.365 --> 01:03:48.901
Bad driver. Not necessarily.

1191
01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:50.653
Cheated on his missus.
Most certainly.

1192
01:03:50.744 --> 01:03:52.700
And we both know who with.
Eve draper.

1193
01:03:54.581 --> 01:03:55.616
True.

1194
01:03:55.707 --> 01:03:57.117
Favored older men. Fingered.

1195
01:03:57.208 --> 01:03:58.448
Worked at? Council.

1196
01:03:58.543 --> 01:03:59.658
More specifically?

1197
01:03:59.753 --> 01:04:01.273
Department of planning
and development.

1198
01:04:01.338 --> 01:04:02.953
Where George merchant
secured permission

1199
01:04:03.048 --> 01:04:05.414
to build his dubious mansion
on Norris Avenue.

1200
01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:06.623
So...

1201
01:04:06.718 --> 01:04:07.918
Maybe they were all accidents.

1202
01:04:09.137 --> 01:04:10.798
People have accidents every day.

1203
01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:13.550
What are you two up to?

1204
01:04:13.641 --> 01:04:14.641
Nothing.

1205
01:04:14.726 --> 01:04:15.841
Well, look sharp.

1206
01:04:15.935 --> 01:04:17.330
There's been reports of
a fire in the station.

1207
01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:18.685
What?

1208
01:04:18.772 --> 01:04:22.435
All: Happy birthday to you

1209
01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:26.734
happy birthday to you

1210
01:04:26.821 --> 01:04:28.652
Danny, why didn't you
say something?

1211
01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.480
We were working, weren't we?

1212
01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:34.405
Hey, where are you going?

1213
01:04:34.496 --> 01:04:35.952
Personal errand.

1214
01:04:42.754 --> 01:04:44.164
Hello, miss tiller.

1215
01:04:44.255 --> 01:04:46.962
I was wondering, do you have
any Japanese peace lilies?

1216
01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:48.460
Of course.

1217
01:04:49.219 --> 01:04:51.676
I was just about to
pop off, actually.

1218
01:04:52.514 --> 01:04:54.800
I can never find my scissors.

1219
01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:57.265
Is this for someone special?

1220
01:04:57.519 --> 01:04:59.384
Yes. Yes, it is.

1221
01:05:01.439 --> 01:05:03.725
Are you going somewhere,
miss tiller?

1222
01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:06.058
Yes. I'm moving away.

1223
01:05:07.195 --> 01:05:10.358
And why the move, if you
don't mind me asking?

1224
01:05:10.448 --> 01:05:13.565
Well, just between you and I...

1225
01:05:14.035 --> 01:05:15.400
Yes?

1226
01:05:15.495 --> 01:05:16.951
You know that fella who blew up?

1227
01:05:17.038 --> 01:05:18.403
George merchant.

1228
01:05:18.498 --> 01:05:21.661
Well, George merchant, god rest
him, wanted to buy this land,

1229
01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:25.335
so he sends round his legal fella,
Martin blower, god rest him,

1230
01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:27.538
and I thought I might
take them up on it.

1231
01:05:27.632 --> 01:05:29.748
I haven't really got that
much family round here,

1232
01:05:29.843 --> 01:05:31.333
save for cousin sissy.

1233
01:05:31.428 --> 01:05:34.886
So I thought I might take them up on
the offer and move to buford Abbey.

1234
01:05:34.973 --> 01:05:36.964
Would you like a card with this?

1235
01:05:37.142 --> 01:05:39.428
No, sorry, you were talking
about the offer?

1236
01:05:39.519 --> 01:05:42.727
Well, it turns out that
Martin blower, god rest him,

1237
01:05:42.814 --> 01:05:44.975
knew where the new
bypass road is going

1238
01:05:45.066 --> 01:05:48.149
because he was knocking off Eve draper
from the council, god rest her,

1239
01:05:48.236 --> 01:05:51.945
and then that reporter, god rest
him, finds out about the route

1240
01:05:52.031 --> 01:05:54.147
and tells me this
land's very valuable.

1241
01:05:54.242 --> 01:05:56.483
Ten times what George
merchant and Martin blower,

1242
01:05:56.578 --> 01:05:58.318
god rest them, offered me.

1243
01:05:58.413 --> 01:05:59.823
So, with them having passed on,

1244
01:05:59.914 --> 01:06:01.404
I decided to sell it on myself

1245
01:06:01.499 --> 01:06:04.286
to some folks from the city
that Martin, George and Eve,

1246
01:06:04.377 --> 01:06:06.413
god rest the lot of them,
had been talking to.

1247
01:06:06.504 --> 01:06:09.337
Apparently, they want to build a
big shopping center or something.

1248
01:06:09.424 --> 01:06:12.211
Of course, cousin sissy won't
be too happy about that,

1249
01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:14.447
but as far as I'm concerned,
cousin sissy can go and fuck...

1250
01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:17.463
Would you just excuse me,
for just one second?

1251
01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:33.528
Stop!

1252
01:06:34.407 --> 01:06:36.022
In the name of the law!

1253
01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:36.208
Fisher: Hang about, hang about.

1254
01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:39.339
You're saying this
wasn't an accident?

1255
01:07:40.682 --> 01:07:42.718
Leslie tiller was
fucking murdered!

1256
01:07:42.809 --> 01:07:44.265
What, just like Tim messenger?
Yes

1257
01:07:44.352 --> 01:07:45.512
and George merchant? Yes!

1258
01:07:45.603 --> 01:07:46.843
Cartwright: And Eve draper? Yes

1259
01:07:46.938 --> 01:07:48.553
and Martin blower? No, actually.

1260
01:07:48.648 --> 01:07:50.513
Really? 'Course he fucking was!

1261
01:07:50.608 --> 01:07:52.519
Thank you, Danny.

1262
01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:54.271
Oh, murder, murder, murder.

1263
01:07:54.362 --> 01:07:55.943
Change the fucking record.

1264
01:07:56.531 --> 01:07:57.691
Thank you, Andy.

1265
01:07:57.782 --> 01:07:59.488
Come on, sergeant,
you've gotta accept

1266
01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:02.033
it was just another
nasty accident,

1267
01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:03.200
what are you suggesting?

1268
01:08:03.288 --> 01:08:05.779
That Leslie tiller tripped
and fell on her own shears?

1269
01:08:05.873 --> 01:08:08.330
Ben Fletcher fell on his
pitchfork the other week.

1270
01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:09.874
Yeah, accidents
happen all the time.

1271
01:08:09.961 --> 01:08:11.872
What makes you think
it was murder?

1272
01:08:11.963 --> 01:08:13.419
Because I was there!

1273
01:08:13.506 --> 01:08:14.916
Cartwright: There's a point.

1274
01:08:15.008 --> 01:08:16.373
Why were you there?

1275
01:08:16.467 --> 01:08:18.128
I was buying constable Butterman

1276
01:08:18.219 --> 01:08:20.710
a Japanese peace Lily
for his birthday.

1277
01:08:20.805 --> 01:08:23.387
What absolute horseshit.

1278
01:08:23.474 --> 01:08:25.430
I chased a suspect
from the scene.

1279
01:08:25.518 --> 01:08:27.429
Innocent people don't run!

1280
01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:30.603
Here, maybe it was our old
friend, the cactus thief.

1281
01:08:30.690 --> 01:08:33.397
Oh, yeah, he was a prickly
customer, weren't he?

1282
01:08:34.235 --> 01:08:36.942
Am I going completely mad?

1283
01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:40.734
Maybe you are.

1284
01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:45.402
Maybe you did it.

1285
01:08:45.496 --> 01:08:48.829
Yeah, seeing as how you're
such a big fan of murder.

1286
01:08:48.916 --> 01:08:50.326
What the... sergeant angel?

1287
01:08:50.418 --> 01:08:52.909
Yes! Sir.

1288
01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:58.373
Nicholas, Nicholas, Nicholas.

1289
01:08:58.468 --> 01:09:01.050
What am I going to do with you?

1290
01:09:01.137 --> 01:09:02.502
Sir, you have to understand...

1291
01:09:02.597 --> 01:09:05.634
No, you have to understand.

1292
01:09:06.684 --> 01:09:10.643
The boys here aren't used to the
concepts you're bandying about.

1293
01:09:11.272 --> 01:09:13.763
The "m" word, Nicholas.

1294
01:09:13.858 --> 01:09:18.067
There hasn't been a recorded
murder in sandford for 20 years.

1295
01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:19.985
But, sir, I'm certain.

1296
01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:23.732
And what's more,
I know who did it.

1297
01:09:29.791 --> 01:09:31.702
Can I see the manager, please?

1298
01:09:37.215 --> 01:09:39.547
Mr. Skinner to the
manager's office.

1299
01:09:39.634 --> 01:09:43.172
Manager's office. Mr. Skinner.

1300
01:09:43.888 --> 01:09:45.378
Sergeant angel.

1301
01:09:45.473 --> 01:09:47.338
And to what do I owe
this pleasure?

1302
01:09:47.433 --> 01:09:49.193
Simon Skinner, I'm
arresting you on suspicion

1303
01:09:49.227 --> 01:09:51.513
of the murder of Leslie tiller.

1304
01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:55.062
Leslie tiller's dead? How?

1305
01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:57.523
She tripped and fell
on her own shears.

1306
01:09:57.610 --> 01:09:58.725
Owl

1307
01:09:59.153 --> 01:10:02.486
I'm also arresting you on suspicion of
the murder of Tim messenger on may 1st,

1308
01:10:02.573 --> 01:10:04.188
of George merchant on April 29th

1309
01:10:04.283 --> 01:10:06.865
and of Eve draper and Martin
blower on April 28th.

1310
01:10:06.953 --> 01:10:09.160
Why on earth would
I do that, sergeant?

1311
01:10:09.247 --> 01:10:11.158
I'm glad you asked.

1312
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:14.870
My suspicions were first
aroused when you appeared

1313
01:10:14.961 --> 01:10:17.748
at the scene of the blower-draper
death, on the outskirts of sandford,

1314
01:10:17.839 --> 01:10:21.673
despite the fact you live and work
in the center of the village.

1315
01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:24.716
I couldn't help but
recall your comments

1316
01:10:24.804 --> 01:10:27.216
at the theater on
the previous evening.

1317
01:10:27.473 --> 01:10:30.431
When you not only indicated an
awareness of the couple's affair

1318
01:10:30.518 --> 01:10:32.579
but also inferred that Eve's
connections at the council

1319
01:10:32.603 --> 01:10:35.561
might make her privy
to important information.

1320
01:10:35.648 --> 01:10:37.934
You even spoke of
"bashing her head in."

1321
01:10:38.025 --> 01:10:41.643
Perhaps hoping you might discover the
route of the proposed sandford bypass.

1322
01:10:41.738 --> 01:10:44.049
You were already suspicious that
George merchant was buying up

1323
01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:46.359
a large area of land on
the outskirts of sandford,

1324
01:10:46.451 --> 01:10:49.409
after an article Tim messenger
wrote in the sandford citizen.

1325
01:10:49.495 --> 01:10:51.031
You see, the land
merchant was buying

1326
01:10:51.122 --> 01:10:53.158
had little value
in of itself but,

1327
01:10:53.249 --> 01:10:55.035
if it became accessible by road,

1328
01:10:55.126 --> 01:10:57.162
it would be a prime
location for say,

1329
01:10:57.545 --> 01:10:59.206
a retail park.

1330
01:10:59.297 --> 01:11:01.288
Consumed with concern
for your business

1331
01:11:01.382 --> 01:11:03.418
and potential disloyalty
from fickle customers,

1332
01:11:03.509 --> 01:11:06.091
you yourself expressed
a wish to behead.

1333
01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:09.258
Em atn om eran ses mene te ee et
rt a esr etre rh a rf tl st sees I

1334
01:11:09.348 --> 01:11:11.259
staging the murders
as accidents.

1335
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:12.715
You used a vehicle removal truck

1336
01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:14.425
to stage the blower-draper death

1337
01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:16.431
and incinerated an old man
in his own house.

1338
01:11:16.522 --> 01:11:19.730
Covering your tracks with the judicial
application of bacon and beans.

1339
01:11:19.817 --> 01:11:22.775
However, there was a loose end.

1340
01:11:23.821 --> 01:11:25.277
Tim messenger.

1341
01:11:25.364 --> 01:11:27.525
Splattered before he
could share with me

1342
01:11:27.617 --> 01:11:30.575
what he told Leslie tiller
that very afternoon.

1343
01:11:30.661 --> 01:11:33.528
The true value of her land.

1344
01:11:33.915 --> 01:11:36.827
Upon discovering she was about
to sell up to the developers,

1345
01:11:36.918 --> 01:11:39.751
you brutally murdered her
with her own shears.

1346
01:11:39.837 --> 01:11:44.581
And made good your escape utilizing
your impressive skills as a fun runner.

1347
01:11:51.057 --> 01:11:52.497
Very entertaining.
But I rather think

1348
01:11:52.558 --> 01:11:54.844
you've been watching
too many films.

1349
01:11:56.437 --> 01:11:57.517
He hasn't.

1350
01:11:57.605 --> 01:11:59.186
Why would I kill Leslie?

1351
01:11:59.273 --> 01:12:01.355
You clearly aren't aware
that we're related.

1352
01:12:01.442 --> 01:12:04.024
Oh, but I am, "cousin sissy."

1353
01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:07.691
I'm afraid my nickname of sissy

1354
01:12:07.782 --> 01:12:09.864
is only a revelation
to yourself.

1355
01:12:10.117 --> 01:12:13.530
My teenage years studying
ballet are well known.

1356
01:12:13.621 --> 01:12:15.077
Yeah, sissy Skinner.

1357
01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:16.850
Se I a fe srr rant tees srr at
eee sal eee ss esse le ee re ae

1358
01:12:16.874 --> 01:12:18.364
thank you, Andrews.

1359
01:12:18.459 --> 01:12:21.872
Now, despite my comments
about "beheading" customers,

1360
01:12:21.963 --> 01:12:25.455
I personally relish the
competition of another store.

1361
01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:29.209
Anything to energize
my workforce.

1362
01:12:30.721 --> 01:12:32.257
And anyway, what makes you think

1363
01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:35.306
I could dislodge
part of the church roof?

1364
01:12:35.434 --> 01:12:37.891
Or for that matter,
stage a car crash?

1365
01:12:37.979 --> 01:12:41.312
It's a well known fact that the church
roof is in dire need of repair.

1366
01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:43.556
And isn't it true that two
of your own employees

1367
01:12:43.651 --> 01:12:46.142
operate the vehicle removal
service for the council?

1368
01:12:46.237 --> 01:12:48.569
Sergeant,
this is the 21st century.

1369
01:12:48.656 --> 01:12:51.568
Many people hold down
several jobs.

1370
01:12:51.659 --> 01:12:55.402
I myself host a life drawing
class at the village hall.

1371
01:12:55.496 --> 01:12:58.488
Tina here is a table dancer
at flappers.

1372
01:12:58.833 --> 01:13:00.573
Nevertheless, you
could have utilized

1373
01:13:00.668 --> 01:13:02.750
the vehicle removal truck
for your own ends.

1374
01:13:02.837 --> 01:13:04.828
These accusations are quite
meaningless, sergeant,

1375
01:13:04.964 --> 01:13:07.580
unless you can back them up
with hard evidence.

1376
01:13:07.675 --> 01:13:10.257
Well, you've got me there.

1377
01:13:10.344 --> 01:13:12.335
I'd need something conclusive.

1378
01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:14.591
Something that placed you
at the scene of the crime.

1379
01:13:14.682 --> 01:13:16.013
Perhaps a wound you sustained

1380
01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:18.682
on a piece of broken glass
this very evening.

1381
01:13:20.354 --> 01:13:22.015
This very evening.

1382
01:13:23.274 --> 01:13:26.516
Sergeant, this is beginning
to get embarrassing.

1383
01:13:26.652 --> 01:13:29.815
How could I possibly be
in several places at once?

1384
01:13:32.116 --> 01:13:36.780
I'm sure the store's security
footage will absolve me.

1385
01:13:37.496 --> 01:13:40.158
Do feel free to spool through.

1386
01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:58.680
I can handle this, Danny.

1387
01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:02.056
You might as well go back and just
enjoy the rest of your birthday.

1388
01:14:02.146 --> 01:14:03.431
Did you really
get me that plant?

1389
01:14:03.522 --> 01:14:04.728
Yes, I did.

1390
01:14:04.815 --> 01:14:08.273
But it's been impounded
as evidence.

1391
01:14:08.361 --> 01:14:12.980
Well, I mean, maybe dad will
still let me water it, eh?

1392
01:14:13.074 --> 01:14:14.234
Yeah.

1393
01:14:17.662 --> 01:14:19.072
Sergeant, I wanted you
to know that

1394
01:14:19.163 --> 01:14:22.496
if I do indeed now own
the land belonging to...

1395
01:14:24.251 --> 01:14:27.038
Belonging to Leslie,
that I intend to turn it

1396
01:14:27.129 --> 01:14:30.087
into a memorial garden,
in her honor.

1397
01:14:30.174 --> 01:14:34.759
Mr. Skinner, what you do with your
land is of no concern of mine,

1398
01:14:37.556 --> 01:14:38.762
so jog on.

1399
01:14:39.642 --> 01:14:41.428
Michael, will you
escort the sergeant

1400
01:14:41.519 --> 01:14:44.261
off the premises when
he's quite finished?

1401
01:14:44.355 --> 01:14:45.891
Yarp.

1402
01:14:49.026 --> 01:14:52.109
I just can't believe
Leslie's dead.

1403
01:14:52.196 --> 01:14:53.356
How did it happen?

1404
01:14:53.447 --> 01:14:55.779
She tripped and fell
on her own shears.

1405
01:15:03.916 --> 01:15:06.123
Hey, that weren't me.

1406
01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:15.336
Hey, look.

1407
01:15:15.428 --> 01:15:18.135
Look, Mr. treacher's got
his big coat on again.

1408
01:15:21.809 --> 01:15:24.175
You want anything from the shop?

1409
01:15:24.979 --> 01:15:26.219
Cornetto.

1410
01:15:28.774 --> 01:15:30.560
No luck catching
them killers, then?

1411
01:15:30.651 --> 01:15:32.733
It's just the one killer,
actually.

1412
01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:37.980
No luck catching
them killers, then?

1413
01:15:38.075 --> 01:15:39.656
It's just the one killer,
actually.

1414
01:15:39.744 --> 01:15:41.450
No luck catching
them killers, then?

1415
01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:43.073
It's just the one killer,
actually.

1416
01:15:43.164 --> 01:15:45.155
No luck catching
them killers, then?

1417
01:15:45.249 --> 01:15:47.160
It's just the one killer,
actually.

1418
01:15:47.251 --> 01:15:48.811
What's the matter?
You got brain-freeze?

1419
01:15:48.836 --> 01:15:50.497
No, I got brainwave.

1420
01:15:50.588 --> 01:15:52.874
Get us back to the station, now!

1421
01:15:59.847 --> 01:16:01.553
It's more than one person.
Come again?

1422
01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:02.880
It's more than one killer.

1423
01:16:02.975 --> 01:16:04.511
It was Skinner a minute ago.

1424
01:16:04.602 --> 01:16:05.746
Yeah, well, maybe it still is.

1425
01:16:05.770 --> 01:16:08.206
You know, maybe he's... maybe he's
not alone. Maybe there are others.

1426
01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:11.188
Nicholas, you're
an exceptional officer.

1427
01:16:11.275 --> 01:16:13.391
But I've seen this before.

1428
01:16:13.861 --> 01:16:16.443
Sergeant popwell.

1429
01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:19.363
It was exactly the same thing.

1430
01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:23.864
You've come from a city where
there's danger round every corner,

1431
01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:26.867
and it's driven you
round the bend.

1432
01:16:27.374 --> 01:16:28.659
Yes, sir.

1433
01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:32.376
Do yourself a favor.
Sleep on it.

1434
01:16:32.463 --> 01:16:35.296
And if you still feel
the same in the morning,

1435
01:16:35.382 --> 01:16:38.215
I give you my word,
I'll get right on to it.

1436
01:16:42.556 --> 01:16:45.468
Hey. Hey, what's happening?
What's going on?

1437
01:16:46.102 --> 01:16:48.058
Nothing, nothing.

1438
01:16:48.145 --> 01:16:50.056
I'm just gonna go
back to the hotel.

1439
01:16:50.147 --> 01:16:52.103
I mean, do you want a lift?

1440
01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:55.315
No, no, I could do with a walk.

1441
01:17:59.091 --> 01:18:02.003
Hey, big one, playtime's over.

1442
01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:07.755
Skinner on walkie-talkie:
Michael?

1443
01:18:08.642 --> 01:18:11.304
Michael? Are you there?

1444
01:18:11.979 --> 01:18:16.018
Michael? Is everything okay?

1445
01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:19.854
Yarp.

1446
01:18:19.945 --> 01:18:22.687
Sergeant angel's
been taken care of?

1447
01:18:22.781 --> 01:18:23.896
Yarp.

1448
01:18:23.991 --> 01:18:26.448
He's not gonna
get back up again?

1449
01:18:29.079 --> 01:18:30.364
Narp!

1450
01:18:31.624 --> 01:18:34.206
Good. Proceed to the castle.

1451
01:18:39.423 --> 01:18:41.163
Frank, this shit just got real.

1452
01:18:41.258 --> 01:18:42.748
Skinner just sent
someone to kill me,

1453
01:18:42.843 --> 01:18:45.050
and, now, now he's
gone somewhere,

1454
01:18:45.137 --> 01:18:46.489
up to the...
To the castle, I think.

1455
01:18:46.513 --> 01:18:47.782
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go after him.

1456
01:18:47.806 --> 01:18:50.138
Okay? It's Nicholas, by the way.

1457
01:18:52.228 --> 01:18:53.718
Oh, my god.

1458
01:18:54.939 --> 01:18:56.895
What happened to
your peace Lily?

1459
01:18:56.982 --> 01:18:59.223
Danny. Danny,
just stay here, okay?

1460
01:18:59.318 --> 01:19:00.899
And watch him,
and call your dad.

1461
01:19:00.986 --> 01:19:01.986
Tell him I was right.

1462
01:19:02.071 --> 01:19:03.071
What are you gonna do?

1463
01:19:03.155 --> 01:19:04.691
I'm gonna bust
this thing wide open.

1464
01:19:04.782 --> 01:19:06.443
Nicholas, wait.

1465
01:19:07.868 --> 01:19:09.654
You might need this.

1466
01:19:10.454 --> 01:19:11.694
Thanks, partner.

1467
01:19:44.822 --> 01:19:48.235
Skinner: How could I possibly
be in several places at once?

1468
01:19:48.325 --> 01:19:51.488
How could I possibly be
in several places at once?

1469
01:19:51.578 --> 01:19:54.866
How could I possibly be
in several places at once?

1470
01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.118
Joyce: I just can't believe Leslie's dead.
How did it happen?

1471
01:20:00.212 --> 01:20:03.295
Weaver: You'll find that we
run a very tight ship here.

1472
01:20:03.382 --> 01:20:05.277
Reverend shooter: Who could
do something like this?

1473
01:20:05.301 --> 01:20:07.529
Hatcher: Seems like Mr. merchant
tried to have a little fry up

1474
01:20:07.553 --> 01:20:08.668
and left the gas on.

1475
01:20:08.762 --> 01:20:10.093
Nasty way to go.

1476
01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:11.340
Amanda: What happened, Danny?

1477
01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:13.221
Annette: No luck catching
them killers, then?

1478
01:20:13.309 --> 01:20:15.174
No luck catching
them killers, then?

1479
01:20:15.269 --> 01:20:17.476
No luck catching them...

1480
01:20:20.941 --> 01:20:23.353
Now, quick announcement
before we begin.

1481
01:20:23.444 --> 01:20:27.813
Janet barker has decided to
call her boys Roger and Martin.

1482
01:20:27.906 --> 01:20:33.196
And the christening will be a week
on Saturday and we're all invited.

1483
01:20:33.454 --> 01:20:34.454
Tom.

1484
01:20:34.538 --> 01:20:35.778
Thanks, Joyce.

1485
01:20:35.998 --> 01:20:39.115
Now, you'll all be
delighted to hear

1486
01:20:39.209 --> 01:20:43.873
that the tenacious sergeant
angel has been taken care of.

1487
01:20:43.964 --> 01:20:47.297
Joyce will discover
the sergeant lying

1488
01:20:47.384 --> 01:20:49.545
on the wet floor
of his bathroom,

1489
01:20:49.636 --> 01:20:53.879
having slipped and
tragically broken his neck.

1490
01:20:53.974 --> 01:20:56.056
So, with the dispatch
of the sergeant,

1491
01:20:56.143 --> 01:20:57.883
we will now be
able to concentrate

1492
01:20:57.978 --> 01:21:00.219
on the eradication of
our hoodie infestation.

1493
01:21:00.314 --> 01:21:01.394
Quite right.

1494
01:21:01.482 --> 01:21:04.895
After which, nothing
will stand in our way.

1495
01:21:04.985 --> 01:21:07.897
Oh, I beg to differ, Mr. Weaver.

1496
01:21:07.988 --> 01:21:12.231
Well, well, well,
I see we have visitors.

1497
01:21:12.576 --> 01:21:15.739
Sergeant Nicholas angel.
Sandford police service.

1498
01:21:15.829 --> 01:21:18.571
My, he is tenacious, isn't he?

1499
01:21:18.665 --> 01:21:19.934
I'm arresting you
under suspicion

1500
01:21:19.958 --> 01:21:21.494
of conspiracy to commit murder.

1501
01:21:21.627 --> 01:21:24.414
Oh, come, come, sergeant.

1502
01:21:24.505 --> 01:21:26.086
You should be ashamed.

1503
01:21:26.173 --> 01:21:27.913
Calling yourself
a community that cares.

1504
01:21:28.008 --> 01:21:29.748
Oh, but we do care, Nicholas.

1505
01:21:29.843 --> 01:21:31.583
It's all about the greater good.

1506
01:21:31.678 --> 01:21:33.168
All: The greater good.

1507
01:21:33.263 --> 01:21:34.753
How can this be
for the greater good?

1508
01:21:34.848 --> 01:21:36.338
All: The greater good.

1509
01:21:36.475 --> 01:21:38.661
You see, as much as I enjoyed
your wild theories, sergeant,

1510
01:21:38.685 --> 01:21:40.346
the truth is far less complex.

1511
01:21:40.479 --> 01:21:42.435
Blower's fate was
simply the result

1512
01:21:42.523 --> 01:21:45.606
of his being an appalling actor.

1513
01:21:47.194 --> 01:21:48.434
All: Quite appalling.

1514
01:21:48.529 --> 01:21:50.269
You murdered him for that?

1515
01:21:51.365 --> 01:21:52.592
Well, he murdered
bill Shakespeare.

1516
01:21:52.616 --> 01:21:53.776
What?

1517
01:21:53.867 --> 01:21:57.359
The dramatic society is an
important feather in our cap.

1518
01:21:57.704 --> 01:21:59.182
Hatcher: Couldn't let
blower jeopardize that.

1519
01:21:59.206 --> 01:22:01.518
Not when we had two semi-professionals
waiting in the wings.

1520
01:22:01.542 --> 01:22:04.124
Let's not forget that Greg
was an extra in straw dogs.

1521
01:22:04.211 --> 01:22:06.122
And sheree played a cadaver
in prime suspect.

1522
01:22:06.213 --> 01:22:07.623
Yes, I know!

1523
01:22:07.714 --> 01:22:10.296
Martin was less concerned with
the reputation of the village

1524
01:22:10.384 --> 01:22:13.626
than he was with his sordid
affair with Eve draper.

1525
01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:15.301
And so Eve deserved to die too?

1526
01:22:15.389 --> 01:22:17.801
Well, she did have
a very annoying laugh.

1527
01:22:17.891 --> 01:22:19.131
All: Annoying.

1528
01:22:19.226 --> 01:22:20.226
And, and George merchant?

1529
01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:22.050
He had an awful house.

1530
01:22:22.354 --> 01:22:23.389
All: Awful.

1531
01:22:23.522 --> 01:22:25.202
We begged him in vain
to make his residence

1532
01:22:25.232 --> 01:22:27.814
more in keeping with the
village's rustic aesthetic.

1533
01:22:28.902 --> 01:22:31.484
And what about Tim messenger?
What was his crime?

1534
01:22:31.572 --> 01:22:36.236
Tim messenger's tenure as editor of the
sandford citizen has been unbearable.

1535
01:22:36.368 --> 01:22:40.156
Our once great paper had become
riddled with tabloid journalism.

1536
01:22:40.247 --> 01:22:42.238
Not to mention
persistent errors.

1537
01:22:42.332 --> 01:22:43.788
He listed her age as 55.

1538
01:22:43.876 --> 01:22:45.582
When, actually, I'm 83.

1539
01:22:45.669 --> 01:22:47.159
Fifty-three.

1540
01:22:47.254 --> 01:22:48.982
What, what about Leslie tiller?
One of your own?

1541
01:22:49.006 --> 01:22:51.497
Her horticultural expertise
helped put sandford on the map.

1542
01:22:51.592 --> 01:22:53.583
Oh, she was ever so good.

1543
01:22:53.719 --> 01:22:55.880
Cousin Leslie was
a terrible shame.

1544
01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:59.843
But it seemed she was
set on moving away.

1545
01:22:59.933 --> 01:23:03.346
We couldn't have her sharing her
green fingers with anybody else.

1546
01:23:03.437 --> 01:23:05.348
Not least those heathens
at buford Abbey.

1547
01:23:05.439 --> 01:23:08.101
If we can't have her,
no one can.

1548
01:23:08.233 --> 01:23:09.769
How can this be
for the greater good?

1549
01:23:09.902 --> 01:23:11.938
All: The greater good. Shut it!

1550
01:23:12.029 --> 01:23:13.314
These people died for no reason.

1551
01:23:13.405 --> 01:23:15.145
No reason whatsoever!

1552
01:23:15.282 --> 01:23:17.773
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

1553
01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:20.905
Hello, Nicholas.

1554
01:23:21.955 --> 01:23:23.911
I was like you once.

1555
01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:27.958
I believed in the immutable
word of the law.

1556
01:23:28.253 --> 01:23:32.087
That is until the night Mrs.
Butterman was taken from me.

1557
01:23:32.966 --> 01:23:35.628
You see, no one loved
sandford more than her.

1558
01:23:35.761 --> 01:23:37.251
She was head of
the women's institute,

1559
01:23:37.346 --> 01:23:39.712
chair of the floral committee.

1560
01:23:39.806 --> 01:23:41.888
When they started the village
of the year contest,

1561
01:23:41.975 --> 01:23:43.590
she worked round the clock.

1562
01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:45.676
I've never seen such dedication.

1563
01:23:47.022 --> 01:23:49.513
On the Eve of
the adjudicator's arrival,

1564
01:23:49.608 --> 01:23:52.190
some travelers moved
into Callahan park.

1565
01:23:53.153 --> 01:23:54.893
Before you could say,
"gypsy scum,”

1566
01:23:54.988 --> 01:23:56.694
we were knee-deep in dog muck,

1567
01:23:56.823 --> 01:23:59.109
thieving kids
and crusty jugglers.

1568
01:23:59.201 --> 01:24:00.941
All: Crusty jugglers.

1569
01:24:01.036 --> 01:24:04.153
We lost the title
and Irene lost her mind.

1570
01:24:05.123 --> 01:24:09.241
She drove her Datsun cherry
into sandford gorge.

1571
01:24:09.336 --> 01:24:14.501
From that moment on, I swore
that I would do her proud.

1572
01:24:14.841 --> 01:24:19.335
And whatever the cost, we would
make sandford great again.

1573
01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:21.511
Sir, this doesn't
make any sense.

1574
01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:23.551
The adjudicators
arrive tomorrow.

1575
01:24:23.642 --> 01:24:25.473
We had to get everything ready.

1576
01:24:25.561 --> 01:24:28.268
Are you saying this is all about
winning the best village award?

1577
01:24:28.355 --> 01:24:30.471
This is the best village,
Nicholas.

1578
01:24:30.566 --> 01:24:32.102
You've seen the people. Peop

1579
01:24:32.192 --> 01:24:34.649
they're happy, contented.

1580
01:24:34.736 --> 01:24:36.601
They're living in a dream world.

1581
01:24:36.697 --> 01:24:39.313
Sergeant popwell thought
much the same as you.

1582
01:24:39.408 --> 01:24:41.444
I'm disappointed you can't
see the bigger picture.

1583
01:24:41.535 --> 01:24:43.947
Well, I'm happy to
disappoint you, sir.

1584
01:24:44.037 --> 01:24:45.848
And I'm afraid you're gonna
have to come with me.

1585
01:24:45.872 --> 01:24:47.954
You are all gonna
have to come with me.

1586
01:24:48.041 --> 01:24:52.125
No, Nicholas,
I'm afraid it is you

1587
01:24:52.212 --> 01:24:54.954
who is going to have
to come with us.

1588
01:25:03.015 --> 01:25:04.596
Danny, no.

1589
01:25:09.021 --> 01:25:10.477
Back off! Back off!

1590
01:25:10.564 --> 01:25:12.875
Or I swear to god, you'll be
explaining how Danny tripped over

1591
01:25:12.899 --> 01:25:14.379
and accidentally
cut off his own head.

1592
01:25:14.443 --> 01:25:16.604
Come on, Nicholas. You
haven't got it in you.

1593
01:25:16.737 --> 01:25:18.068
I mean it!

1594
01:25:21.742 --> 01:25:22.948
Shit!

1595
01:25:37.758 --> 01:25:41.046
 Gypsy scum. Travelers.

1596
01:25:41.136 --> 01:25:44.253
Thieving kids. Dog muck.

1597
01:25:46.475 --> 01:25:48.340
All: Crusty jugglers.

1598
01:25:48.602 --> 01:25:52.140
Crusty jugglers.
Crusty jugglers.

1599
01:25:53.023 --> 01:25:54.354
Crusty jugglers.

1600
01:25:54.441 --> 01:25:58.059
 There hasn't been a recorded
murder in sandford for 20 years.

1601
01:25:58.153 --> 01:25:59.484
There's a reason we accommodate

1602
01:25:59.571 --> 01:26:01.107
a few of the younglings
at the pub.

1603
01:26:01.198 --> 01:26:03.735
Spot of bother up
at ellroy farm.

1604
01:26:03.825 --> 01:26:06.612
I'll make sure everyone
gets their just deserts.

1605
01:26:11.792 --> 01:26:14.625
Weaver: If we don't come down
hard on these clowns...

1606
01:26:14.711 --> 01:26:16.451
 We'll get round to it.

1607
01:26:28.684 --> 01:26:29.719
Danny!

1608
01:27:04.845 --> 01:27:06.176
Ta-=da.

1609
01:27:06.346 --> 01:27:07.927
What are you doing?

1610
01:27:08.014 --> 01:27:09.550
Saving your skin.

1611
01:27:11.852 --> 01:27:12.932
This is murder!

1612
01:27:13.019 --> 01:27:14.509
It's not, it's ketchup.

1613
01:27:14.604 --> 01:27:17.346
I'm not talking about that,
I'm talking about the others.

1614
01:27:17.441 --> 01:27:18.441
What others?

1615
01:27:18.525 --> 01:27:20.436
The others the nwa
have murdered.

1616
01:27:20.527 --> 01:27:21.812
That's not true. It is!

1617
01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:24.064
Dad just said it was
his special club, he...

1618
01:27:24.197 --> 01:27:26.092
I thought it was about rapping
people on the knuckles

1619
01:27:26.116 --> 01:27:27.316
and sending them on their way.

1620
01:27:27.367 --> 01:27:29.323
There are skeletons back there!

1621
01:27:29.411 --> 01:27:31.051
I don't know nothing
about no skelingtons.

1622
01:27:31.079 --> 01:27:32.265
What did you think
was happening?

1623
01:27:32.289 --> 01:27:33.324
Not this!

1624
01:27:33.415 --> 01:27:34.530
It's f erank

1625
01:27:34.624 --> 01:27:36.831
he's appointed himself
judge, jury and executioner.

1626
01:27:36.918 --> 01:27:38.658
He's not judge Judy
and executioner.

1627
01:27:38.754 --> 01:27:40.164
He is!

1628
01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:41.916
You've gotta help me
take him down.

1629
01:27:42.007 --> 01:27:43.543
I can't.

1630
01:27:44.551 --> 01:27:47.384
He's my dad. Take my car.

1631
01:27:48.472 --> 01:27:51.430
Go back to London.
There's nothing you can do.

1632
01:27:51.558 --> 01:27:53.014
I can come back.

1633
01:27:53.101 --> 01:27:55.217
I can come back, and I
can bring the blue fury

1634
01:27:55.312 --> 01:27:57.348
of the metropolitan
police service with me.

1635
01:27:57.439 --> 01:28:00.476
They'll make it disappear.
Who are they gonna believe?

1636
01:28:00.567 --> 01:28:03.274
My dad, or a loony
London police officer.

1637
01:28:03.403 --> 01:28:04.893
But it won't be
just me, will it?

1638
01:28:04.988 --> 01:28:08.230
We can do it together.
You and me. Partners.

1639
01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:12.238
Forget it, Nicholas.
It's sandford.

1640
01:29:03.463 --> 01:29:05.670
Is that everything? Sir?

1641
01:29:17.143 --> 01:29:19.759
Is there anything
I can do for you?

1642
01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:21.640
No.

1643
01:29:24.526 --> 01:29:26.812
This is something
I have to do myself.

1644
01:29:52.512 --> 01:29:56.346
Another beautiful day
in god's country.

1645
01:30:04.024 --> 01:30:05.514
Danny?

1646
01:30:14.576 --> 01:30:15.816
It's...

1647
01:30:21.207 --> 01:30:22.287
Mum!

1648
01:30:33.678 --> 01:30:35.134
What you gonna do?

1649
01:30:35.221 --> 01:30:38.304
Just walk in and arrest
the whole village?

1650
01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:41.266
Not exactly.

1651
01:31:14.260 --> 01:31:15.670
Oh, sergeant angel?

1652
01:31:15.762 --> 01:31:17.502
Someone from London
called for you.

1653
01:31:25.605 --> 01:31:27.891
I'll tell them
you'll ring them back.

1654
01:31:30.151 --> 01:31:31.186
Well, that's funny.

1655
01:31:31.277 --> 01:31:32.312
 What's that?

1656
01:31:32.779 --> 01:31:35.441
I didn't know we had
a mounted division.

1657
01:31:35.532 --> 01:31:37.272
Nobody tells me nothing.

1658
01:31:53.675 --> 01:31:55.461
Wanna do something useful?

1659
01:32:04.936 --> 01:32:09.851
Amanda: Annette, that sergeant
angel's back. Check out his horse.

1660
01:32:10.817 --> 01:32:12.773
Annette: Roger that!

1661
01:32:14.487 --> 01:32:15.772
It's...

1662
01:32:16.614 --> 01:32:17.820
Angel.

1663
01:33:28.812 --> 01:33:29.972
Morning.

1664
01:34:53.521 --> 01:34:55.477
That's what I'm talking about.

1665
01:35:10.413 --> 01:35:12.574
Still feel like you're
missing out?

1666
01:35:39.275 --> 01:35:40.640
Fascist!

1667
01:35:57.293 --> 01:35:58.453
Hag!

1668
01:36:16.896 --> 01:36:20.639
Stop! Stop this, please!

1669
01:36:21.317 --> 01:36:24.684
Let us stop this
mindless violence.

1670
01:36:25.989 --> 01:36:27.980
Nicholas, my son.

1671
01:36:29.075 --> 01:36:33.068
You may not be a man of god, but
surely you're a man of peace.

1672
01:36:33.162 --> 01:36:35.949
I may not be a man
of god, reverend,

1673
01:36:36.082 --> 01:36:38.915
but I know right,
and I know wrong,

1674
01:36:39.585 --> 01:36:42.167
and I have the good grace
to know which is which.

1675
01:36:42.255 --> 01:36:45.338
Oh, fuck off, grasshopper.

1676
01:36:46.926 --> 01:36:48.336
No!

1677
01:36:49.595 --> 01:36:51.335
Jesus Christ!

1678
01:36:51.848 --> 01:36:53.839
Nicholas! Nicholas!

1679
01:37:00.106 --> 01:37:01.937
I thought you was a goner.

1680
01:37:02.025 --> 01:37:03.731
Drop your weapons!

1681
01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:05.520
Dr. hatcher, no!

1682
01:37:05.611 --> 01:37:06.771
Shut up, Danny.

1683
01:37:07.739 --> 01:37:11.277
I brought you into this world,
I think it's rather fitting

1684
01:37:11.367 --> 01:37:14.200
I should be the one
to take you out of it.

1685
01:37:14.537 --> 01:37:18.371
You and your interfering
little friend.

1686
01:37:18.791 --> 01:37:19.951
Now...

1687
01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:25.620
Drop them.

1688
01:37:42.148 --> 01:37:44.184
You're a doctor, deal with it.

1689
01:37:44.275 --> 01:37:46.266
Yeah, motherfucker.

1690
01:37:46.903 --> 01:37:47.903
Danny, let's roll.

1691
01:37:47.987 --> 01:37:49.193
What you thinking?

1692
01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:52.320
Pub?

1693
01:38:52.468 --> 01:38:54.379
Roy!

1694
01:38:55.138 --> 01:38:58.130
Somebody call the police!

1695
01:38:58.224 --> 01:38:59.384
Freeze!

1696
01:39:02.311 --> 01:39:05.144
Officers, arrest that man.

1697
01:39:05.565 --> 01:39:07.647
Danny, step away
from the sergeant.

1698
01:39:07.733 --> 01:39:09.098
No, dad.

1699
01:39:09.193 --> 01:39:11.559
Danny, you'll do as you're told.

1700
01:39:11.696 --> 01:39:14.153
I'm not taking orders
from you anymore.

1701
01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:16.572
Officers, arrest these men!

1702
01:39:16.659 --> 01:39:17.774
Wait, wait!

1703
01:39:17.869 --> 01:39:19.054
You can arrest us if you like.

1704
01:39:19.078 --> 01:39:20.389
You can throw us in
prison and go back

1705
01:39:20.413 --> 01:39:21.723
to being blind,
submissive slaves.

1706
01:39:21.747 --> 01:39:23.578
Or you can be real
police officers,

1707
01:39:23.708 --> 01:39:25.915
and help us bring an end
to this absurd story.

1708
01:39:26.002 --> 01:39:28.163
What the fuck is he on about?

1709
01:39:28.254 --> 01:39:29.414
Fuck are you on about?

1710
01:39:29.547 --> 01:39:32.163
Have you ever wondered why the
crime rate in sandford is so low?

1711
01:39:32.258 --> 01:39:34.123
And yet the accident rate,
it's so high?

1712
01:39:34.218 --> 01:39:36.004
No. Yeah. What?

1713
01:39:36.095 --> 01:39:38.006
You've been brainwashed, Tony.

1714
01:39:38.097 --> 01:39:41.339
Brainwashed into naivety by an old
man with a murderous obsession.

1715
01:39:41.434 --> 01:39:42.765
This is ridiculous.

1716
01:39:42.852 --> 01:39:46.344
No, it's not, dad.
It's very unridiculous.

1717
01:39:46.439 --> 01:39:49.431
And it's only now that I'm starting to
realize how unridiculous it all is.

1718
01:39:49.567 --> 01:39:51.057
Silence, Danny!

1719
01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:52.395
Think of your mother.

1720
01:39:52.487 --> 01:39:54.273
Mum is dead, dad.

1721
01:39:55.531 --> 01:39:58.864
For the first time in my
life, you know, I'm glad.

1722
01:39:58.951 --> 01:40:01.363
If she could see
what you've become,

1723
01:40:01.454 --> 01:40:05.538
I think she'd probably
kill herself all over again.

1724
01:40:05.625 --> 01:40:07.206
Sorry, I am completely lost.

1725
01:40:07.293 --> 01:40:08.954
Sandford is a lie, Doris.

1726
01:40:09.086 --> 01:40:12.453
For the last 20 years, the village has
been controlled by frank and the nwa.

1727
01:40:12.590 --> 01:40:15.070
They've lulled everyone into
thinking this is a perfect village

1728
01:40:15.134 --> 01:40:17.921
and killed anyone who's
threatened to change that.

1729
01:40:25.561 --> 01:40:27.643
I reckon he's got
something there.

1730
01:40:29.106 --> 01:40:32.064
He says, "he reckons
you got something there."

1731
01:40:32.151 --> 01:40:33.391
I know.

1732
01:40:33.486 --> 01:40:36.728
You're not seriously gonna
believe this man, are you?

1733
01:40:36.822 --> 01:40:39.939
Are you? He isn't even
from round here.

1734
01:40:43.829 --> 01:40:48.118
Maybe it's time
to give it up, sir.

1735
01:40:49.794 --> 01:40:52.331
You incompetent flatfoots!

1736
01:41:01.514 --> 01:41:04.176
Officer Walker, stay here with
Saxon and hold everything down.

1737
01:41:04.267 --> 01:41:05.347
Fair enough.

1738
01:41:05.476 --> 01:41:07.512
Officers, let's go.

1739
01:41:08.479 --> 01:41:09.559
What about dad?

1740
01:41:09.647 --> 01:41:10.762
He'll come round again.

1741
01:41:11.148 --> 01:41:12.979
Want anything from the shop?

1742
01:41:30.710 --> 01:41:31.916
What you thinking? Well...

1743
01:41:32.044 --> 01:41:34.064
We should strike now, while we've
got the element of surprise.

1744
01:41:34.088 --> 01:41:35.983
Longer we wait, more time
they've got to mobilize.

1745
01:41:36.007 --> 01:41:37.401
I say we go in through
the front entrance,

1746
01:41:37.425 --> 01:41:38.756
take the place aisle by aisle.

1747
01:41:38.884 --> 01:41:40.715
They won't be expecting that.

1748
01:41:41.345 --> 01:41:43.051
Very good. What he said.

1749
01:41:45.224 --> 01:41:48.432
My, my. Here come the fuzz.

1750
01:41:50.730 --> 01:41:52.220
Maybe they're not here.

1751
01:41:52.315 --> 01:41:53.475
Wait here.

1752
01:41:53.566 --> 01:41:54.646
Don't go in on your own,

1753
01:41:54.734 --> 01:41:57.100
don't worry,
he knows what he's doing.

1754
01:42:00.072 --> 01:42:01.653
Okay. They're in.

1755
01:42:01.741 --> 01:42:04.858
You deal with the store. I'll
deal with the trolley boy.

1756
01:42:14.211 --> 01:42:16.202
No, listen. Wait,

1757
01:42:16.297 --> 01:42:18.663
wait, listen to me.
Listen, listen.

1758
01:42:18.883 --> 01:42:21.420
Is this what you really,
really want?

1759
01:42:21.761 --> 01:42:22.876
Yarp.

1760
01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:24.426
Suit yourself.

1761
01:42:33.105 --> 01:42:34.811
Fisher: Go, go, go.

1762
01:42:37.234 --> 01:42:39.316
Oh, come on.

1763
01:42:51.624 --> 01:42:53.489
Andy!

1764
01:42:56.253 --> 01:42:59.245
It's all right, Andy.
It's just bolognese!

1765
01:43:59.692 --> 01:44:01.603
How's lurch?
He's in the freezer.

1766
01:44:01.694 --> 01:44:02.900
Did you say, "cool off"?

1767
01:44:02.987 --> 01:44:04.172
No, I didn't say
anything, actually.

1768
01:44:04.196 --> 01:44:05.902
Shame.

1769
01:44:06.031 --> 01:44:07.509
There was a bit earlier on
that you missed

1770
01:44:07.533 --> 01:44:09.177
when I distracted him
with the cuddly monkey.

1771
01:44:09.201 --> 01:44:10.566
And then I said,
"playtime's over,"

1772
01:44:10.661 --> 01:44:11.981
and I hit him
with the peace Lily.

1773
01:44:12.037 --> 01:44:14.119
You're off the fucking chain!

1774
01:44:14.206 --> 01:44:15.286
What's the situation?

1775
01:44:15.374 --> 01:44:17.740
Two blokes and
a fuckload of cutlery.

1776
01:44:17.835 --> 01:44:19.200
What do you reckon?

1777
01:44:22.548 --> 01:44:23.754
Idea.

1778
01:44:47.448 --> 01:44:48.938
Good work, everyone.

1779
01:44:58.667 --> 01:44:59.667
Nice one, Doris.

1780
01:44:59.752 --> 01:45:01.663
Nothing like
a bit of girl on girl.

1781
01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:06.422
Fruit attack!

1782
01:45:07.259 --> 01:45:08.695
Can you handle this,
sergeant Fisher?

1783
01:45:08.719 --> 01:45:10.050
We're gonna go after
the big boss.

1784
01:45:10.137 --> 01:45:12.093
We're on it, sergeant.

1785
01:45:12.515 --> 01:45:14.346
Danny, let's rock. Angel!

1786
01:45:14.433 --> 01:45:16.173
Don't go being a twat now.

1787
01:45:16.477 --> 01:45:18.763
I wouldn't give you
the satisfaction.

1788
01:45:25.945 --> 01:45:27.481
We should get down there.

1789
01:45:27.571 --> 01:45:28.811
How?

1790
01:45:35.996 --> 01:45:37.452
Head them off?

1791
01:45:50.302 --> 01:45:51.382
I'll drive.

1792
01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:54.007
Shotgun! Punch that shit!

1793
01:46:37.850 --> 01:46:39.340
Bang! Bang!

1794
01:46:45.357 --> 01:46:46.517
Swan!

1795
01:47:06.045 --> 01:47:07.160
Swan!

1796
01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:38.904
Stay back!
Or the ginger nut gets it!

1797
01:47:40.829 --> 01:47:43.411
You little fucker!

1798
01:48:19.201 --> 01:48:23.490
Get out of my village!

1799
01:48:29.461 --> 01:48:31.952
It's not your village anymore.

1800
01:48:48.814 --> 01:48:50.645
You did good, kid. Ta.

1801
01:48:50.733 --> 01:48:52.940
What's your name?
Aaron a. Aaronson.

1802
01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:54.850
Sorry?

1803
01:48:56.822 --> 01:49:03.443
Angel!

1804
01:49:21.346 --> 01:49:22.677
It's over, Danny.

1805
01:49:24.099 --> 01:49:25.259
It's over.

1806
01:49:29.063 --> 01:49:34.353
This really hurts.

1807
01:49:34.443 --> 01:49:39.858
I'm going to need
some ice-cream.

1808
01:49:39.948 --> 01:49:41.358
Yeah, well, don't worry.

1809
01:49:41.450 --> 01:49:43.130
There's plenty of ice-cream
at the station.

1810
01:49:43.202 --> 01:49:44.362
Isn't that right, Danny?

1811
01:49:45.621 --> 01:49:46.736
Stay back!

1812
01:49:46.830 --> 01:49:48.661
Pack it in, frank,
you silly bastard!

1813
01:49:48.749 --> 01:49:50.285
Now, now.

1814
01:49:50.626 --> 01:49:52.366
We don't want
any more bloodshed.

1815
01:49:52.461 --> 01:49:55.203
Frank, this whole thing started
because you lost somebody you loved.

1816
01:49:55.297 --> 01:49:57.275
Don't expect me to believe
you'd let it end the same way.

1817
01:49:57.299 --> 01:49:59.836
I'll tell you how
this is gonna end!

1818
01:50:42.427 --> 01:50:44.588
I feel like I should
say something smart.

1819
01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:47.467
You don't have to
say anything at all.

1820
01:50:59.361 --> 01:51:02.774
Satisfactory conclusion
to the whole operation.

1821
01:51:02.865 --> 01:51:06.824
Now, my perfect Sunday
would begin with...

1822
01:51:12.166 --> 01:51:13.685
Chief inspector:
What do you say, Nicholas?

1823
01:51:13.709 --> 01:51:15.916
We... we... we have been
trying to reach you for days.

1824
01:51:16.003 --> 01:51:17.539
Yeah, well,
I've been kind of busy.

1825
01:51:17.629 --> 01:51:19.165
Sergeant: We need you back.

1826
01:51:19.256 --> 01:51:21.713
The figures have gone a little
squiffy in your absence,

1827
01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:23.085
it has to be said.

1828
01:51:23.177 --> 01:51:24.292
Come back to London.

1829
01:51:24.386 --> 01:51:25.842
Sandford"s hardly
a fitting place

1830
01:51:25.929 --> 01:51:27.635
for such an exceptional officer.

1831
01:51:27.723 --> 01:51:30.430
Yeah, well, the thing is, sir.

1832
01:51:31.351 --> 01:51:33.137
I kind of like it here.

1833
01:51:33.228 --> 01:51:36.595
Besides, we have to do a
considerable amount of paperwork.

1834
01:52:02.841 --> 01:52:04.752
Fuck's sake, Nick,
this is gonna take ages.

1835
01:52:04.843 --> 01:52:06.629
Yeah, it's gonna take all night.

1836
01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:09.336
Fisher: Well, good job we've
got the manpower, Andy?

1837
01:52:09.431 --> 01:52:11.513
Well, official vocab
guidelines state

1838
01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:13.682
that we say “staffing,”
not "man power, "w

1839
01:52:13.769 --> 01:52:16.431
'cause "man power's”
a bit sexist.

1840
01:52:18.815 --> 01:52:20.655
You don't mind a bit of
manpower do you, Doris?

1841
01:52:20.734 --> 01:52:23.066
Oh, dirty bastard!

1842
01:52:24.821 --> 01:52:25.981
Andy!

1843
01:52:26.073 --> 01:52:28.109
You cheeky fucker!

1844
01:52:36.875 --> 01:52:38.786
You know what you are?

1845
01:52:39.628 --> 01:52:41.289
A bloody busybody!

1846
01:52:47.094 --> 01:52:49.380
No!

1847
01:53:03.860 --> 01:53:05.066
Oh, god, no!

1848
01:53:28.343 --> 01:53:29.583
 Danny!

1849
01:53:32.097 --> 01:53:33.212
Danny!

1850
01:53:34.266 --> 01:53:35.426
Oh, god.

1851
01:53:35.559 --> 01:53:37.174
Hold on, Danny, just hold on.

1852
01:53:37.269 --> 01:53:40.011
Hold on, it's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine.

1853
01:53:40.605 --> 01:53:43.392
Just hang on, hang on!

1854
01:53:43.859 --> 01:53:45.690
Everything's gonna be fine.

1855
01:53:46.945 --> 01:53:48.731
Everything's gonna be fine.

1856
01:53:49.197 --> 01:53:51.028
Everything's gonna be fine.

1857
01:53:51.783 --> 01:53:53.774
Everything's gonna be just fine.

1858
01:54:32.491 --> 01:54:33.571
Hope these are okay.

1859
01:54:36.661 --> 01:54:40.074
Yeah. They're lovely.

1860
01:54:49.633 --> 01:54:51.248
 Any officers
near the church?

1861
01:54:51.343 --> 01:54:52.753
Go ahead, Doris.

1862
01:54:52.844 --> 01:54:54.604
Chief, we've had a report
of some hippy types

1863
01:54:54.679 --> 01:54:57.091
messing with the recycling
bins at the supermarket.

1864
01:54:57.182 --> 01:54:58.922
Leave it with us. Righto.

1865
01:54:59.017 --> 01:55:03.135
Sergeant Butterman, little hand
says it's time to rock and roll.

1866
01:55:03.355 --> 01:55:04.936
Bring the noise.
