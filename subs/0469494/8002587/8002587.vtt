1
00:04:55.271 --> 00:04:56.398
No!

2
00:05:29.973 --> 00:05:32.308
There she is. There she is.

3
00:05:41.568 --> 00:05:43.153
There she is.

4
00:14:31.764 --> 00:14:33.808
Ladies and gentlemen,

5
00:14:33.891 --> 00:14:38.062
I've traveled over half our state
to be here tonight.

6
00:14:38.145 --> 00:14:40.690
I couldn't get away sooner
because my new well was coming in

7
00:14:40.773 --> 00:14:43.693
at Coyote Hills
and I had to see about it.

8
00:14:43.776 --> 00:14:46.821
That well is now flowing
at 2,000 barrels

9
00:14:46.904 --> 00:14:50.116
and it's paying me an income
of $5,000 a week.

10
00:14:50.741 --> 00:14:54.078
I have two others drilling
and I have 16 producing at Antelope,

11
00:14:54.203 --> 00:14:58.624
so, ladies and gentlemen,
if I say I'm an oilman, you will agree.

12
00:15:01.419 --> 00:15:04.130
Now, you have a great chance here,

13
00:15:04.213 --> 00:15:07.133
but bear in mind you could lose it all
if you're not careful.

14
00:15:07.216 --> 00:15:09.635
Out of all men that beg for a chance
to drill your lots,

15
00:15:09.719 --> 00:15:12.972
maybe one in twenty will be oilmen.

16
00:15:13.055 --> 00:15:14.307
The rest will be speculators,

17
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:16.934
that's men trying to get between
you and the oilmen

18
00:15:17.018 --> 00:15:20.646
to get some of the money that ought,
by rights, come to you.

19
00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:23.691
Even if you find one that has money
and means to drill,

20
00:15:23.774 --> 00:15:26.235
he'll maybe know nothing about drilling.

21
00:15:26.319 --> 00:15:28.321
He'll have to hire the job out
on contract,

22
00:15:28.404 --> 00:15:31.240
and then you're depending
on a contractor,

23
00:15:31.324 --> 00:15:32.408
who'll rush the job through

24
00:15:32.491 --> 00:15:34.651
so he can get another contract
just as quick as he can.

25
00:15:34.702 --> 00:15:36.287
This is the way that this works.

26
00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:39.665
What is your offer? We're wasting time.

27
00:15:39.915 --> 00:15:40.916
Please!

28
00:15:44.128 --> 00:15:46.088
I do my own drilling.

29
00:15:46.756 --> 00:15:50.634
And the men that work for me,
work for me, and they are men I know.

30
00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.472
I make it my business to be there
and to see their work.

31
00:15:54.597 --> 00:15:57.683
I don't lose my tools in the hole
and spend months fishing for them.

32
00:15:57.767 --> 00:15:58.994
I don't botch the cementing off

33
00:15:59.018 --> 00:16:02.605
and let water in the hole
and ruin the whole lease.

34
00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.732
I'm a family man.

35
00:16:04.815 --> 00:16:09.487
I run a family business. This is my son
and my partner, H.W. Plain view.

36
00:16:10.446 --> 00:16:15.284
We offer you the bond of family
that very few oilmen can understand.

37
00:16:17.244 --> 00:16:20.331
I'm fixed like no other company
in this field

38
00:16:20.456 --> 00:16:23.626
and that's because
my Coyote Hills well has just come in.

39
00:16:23.751 --> 00:16:26.212
I have a string of tools
all ready to put to work.

40
00:16:26.295 --> 00:16:28.523
I can load a rig onto trucks
and have them here in a week.

41
00:16:28.547 --> 00:16:31.634
I have business connections,
so I can get the lumber for the derricks.

42
00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:35.554
Such things go by friendship
in a rush like this.

43
00:16:35.638 --> 00:16:39.517
And this is why I can guarantee
to start drilling

44
00:16:39.642 --> 00:16:42.561
and to put up the cash to back my word.

45
00:16:42.645 --> 00:16:44.230
I assure you, ladies and gentlemen,

46
00:16:44.313 --> 00:16:47.650
no matter what the others
promise to do,

47
00:16:47.775 --> 00:16:51.195
when it comes to the showdown,
they won't be there.

48
00:16:52.446 --> 00:16:55.449
Sit down! Sit down, you have no right...

49
00:16:56.283 --> 00:16:58.452
Let us discuss what the man has to say.

50
00:16:58.536 --> 00:17:01.580
- Prescott, do you trust this man?
- Let's discuss what he has to say.

51
00:17:01.664 --> 00:17:05.167
- There's logic to what he's saying.
- How does he know? My lot is there!

52
00:17:06.961 --> 00:17:10.089
Two or three years,
it could be ten years!

53
00:17:10.172 --> 00:17:13.342
- We gain nothing by losing our heads!
- Look at that well out there!

54
00:17:13.426 --> 00:17:15.010
Nobody's losing their heads.

55
00:17:15.928 --> 00:17:18.514
You have no business being here!

56
00:17:19.473 --> 00:17:21.976
Sit that woman down, sir!

57
00:17:23.602 --> 00:17:25.020
You can sit down.

58
00:17:25.104 --> 00:17:27.606
Mr. Plain view! Please, Mr. Plain view.

59
00:17:28.691 --> 00:17:30.693
No, Mr. Plain view!
No, where are you going?

60
00:17:30.776 --> 00:17:33.904
- I don't need the lease. Thank you.
- But we need you.

61
00:17:33.988 --> 00:17:36.240
Too much confusion.
Thank you for your time.

62
00:17:36.323 --> 00:17:38.033
No, no, there's no confusion.

63
00:17:38.117 --> 00:17:41.829
I wouldn't take the lease
if you gave it to me as a gift.

64
00:17:52.465 --> 00:17:55.259
Mr. Bankside,
I'm not going to waste your time.

65
00:17:55.342 --> 00:17:57.803
I'd certainly appreciate it
if you didn't waste mine.

66
00:17:57.887 --> 00:18:02.641
Now, if you wish to sign with me, we
can have a well drilling within 10 days.

67
00:18:02.725 --> 00:18:06.187
Your lot is further north
from the discovery well up here.

68
00:18:06.312 --> 00:18:08.898
That means
we'll probably have to dig deeper.

69
00:18:08.981 --> 00:18:11.400
And if there's as much oil here
as I think there is,

70
00:18:11.484 --> 00:18:14.487
it'll be harder to reach, but once
we find it, we can take it right out.

71
00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:19.241
We have to act quickly, because
very soon these fields will be dry.

72
00:18:19.325 --> 00:18:21.660
I need you to know what you want to do.

73
00:18:21.744 --> 00:18:24.788
Now, because of the distance
from the discovery well,

74
00:18:24.872 --> 00:18:27.166
I'll pay you a smaller royalty
than you'd get down there

75
00:18:27.249 --> 00:18:31.086
but I'm prepared to give you
a $1,000 bonus on your lot.

76
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:32.814
What kind of royalty
are you talking about?

77
00:18:32.838 --> 00:18:37.301
One-sixth, plus a guarantee
to start drilling within 10 days.

78
00:18:37.384 --> 00:18:40.638
Now, that's something
you won't find anywhere else.

79
00:18:49.522 --> 00:18:51.524
What age are your children, ma'am?

80
00:18:51.607 --> 00:18:53.359
Ten and twelve.

81
00:18:54.443 --> 00:18:58.364
Mr. Plain view, a question, sir.
Where is your wife?

82
00:19:00.449 --> 00:19:03.327
She died in childbirth, Mrs. Bankside.

83
00:19:04.411 --> 00:19:06.747
So it's just me and my son now.

84
00:19:13.587 --> 00:19:15.464
It's coming in, boss!

85
00:19:15.881 --> 00:19:17.216
Hear it?

86
00:19:43.492 --> 00:19:45.202
Mr. Plain view?

87
00:19:45.286 --> 00:19:46.537
Yes?

88
00:19:48.747 --> 00:19:50.874
Are you Daniel Plain view?

89
00:19:52.751 --> 00:19:53.919
Yes.

90
00:19:55.546 --> 00:19:57.548
What can I do for you?

91
00:19:59.341 --> 00:20:01.176
You look for oil.

92
00:20:02.386 --> 00:20:03.887
That's right.

93
00:20:04.013 --> 00:20:07.057
What do you pay for a place that has it?

94
00:20:07.182 --> 00:20:10.185
- Well, that depends.
- What does it depend on?

95
00:20:12.187 --> 00:20:14.064
On a lot of things.

96
00:20:14.982 --> 00:20:19.987
If I told you I knew a place that had oil
where land could be bought cheaply,

97
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:22.865
what do you think that would be worth?

98
00:20:23.866 --> 00:20:28.120
I think that you should let me know
what you know

99
00:20:28.203 --> 00:20:31.373
and then we'll try
and work something out.

100
00:20:33.375 --> 00:20:35.544
- Can I sit down?
- Please.

101
00:20:46.639 --> 00:20:48.974
What church do you belong to?

102
00:20:54.647 --> 00:20:55.981
I...

103
00:20:58.108 --> 00:21:01.654
I enjoy all faiths. I don't belong
to one church in particular.

104
00:21:01.737 --> 00:21:05.783
I like them all. I like everything.
Where are you from?

105
00:21:05.866 --> 00:21:09.745
That would be telling you.
That's what I want to sell you.

106
00:21:12.289 --> 00:21:14.875
What are you doing in Signal Hill?

107
00:21:14.958 --> 00:21:17.378
We have oil,
and it seeps through the ground.

108
00:21:17.461 --> 00:21:19.101
Do you want to pay me
to know where it is?

109
00:21:19.129 --> 00:21:20.273
Just 'cause there's something
on the ground

110
00:21:20.297 --> 00:21:22.091
doesn't mean
there's anything beneath it.

111
00:21:22.174 --> 00:21:24.927
Why did Standard Oil buy up land?

112
00:21:27.471 --> 00:21:29.390
Is it in California?

113
00:21:30.265 --> 00:21:33.435
- Maybe.
- How much land did they buy?

114
00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.980
I'd like it better
if you didn't think I was stupid.

115
00:21:45.406 --> 00:21:47.783
Why did you come to me?

116
00:21:47.866 --> 00:21:52.204
- You just brought this well in.
- That's right.

117
00:21:52.287 --> 00:21:56.625
Yes, so just give me $500 in cash
right now

118
00:21:56.709 --> 00:21:59.169
and I'll tell you where it is.

119
00:21:59.253 --> 00:22:01.547
I'll tell you what I'll do, son.
I'll give you $100 now,

120
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:06.301
and if it proves to be a promising lease,
then give you a $1,000 bonus.

121
00:22:06.385 --> 00:22:08.345
Six hundred dollars.

122
00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.059
Tell me one thing to help me decide.
What else have you got up there?

123
00:22:14.143 --> 00:22:15.853
What do you grow?

124
00:22:15.936 --> 00:22:19.690
We have a big ranch,
but it's mostly rocks.

125
00:22:19.773 --> 00:22:22.276
Plant things.
Nothing will grow but weeds.

126
00:22:22.359 --> 00:22:23.610
What makes you think it's up?

127
00:22:23.694 --> 00:22:26.822
Is there sulfur around?
Or alkali deposits?

128
00:22:26.905 --> 00:22:29.992
Alkali nearby. I don't know sulfur.

129
00:22:36.498 --> 00:22:38.333
Is that your son?

130
00:22:38.751 --> 00:22:40.085
Yes.

131
00:22:41.378 --> 00:22:42.671
- Hi.
- Hi.

132
00:22:45.841 --> 00:22:48.719
- Who are you?
- I'm Fletcher Hamilton.

133
00:22:48.844 --> 00:22:50.804
Nice to meet you, son.
What's your name?

134
00:22:50.888 --> 00:22:52.556
What do you do?

135
00:22:53.515 --> 00:22:55.684
I work with Mr. Plain view.

136
00:22:56.351 --> 00:22:58.103
Here's $500, son.

137
00:22:58.187 --> 00:23:02.065
You tell me something worth hearing,
this money's yours.

138
00:23:06.028 --> 00:23:09.907
I come from a town called Little Boston
in Isabella County.

139
00:23:12.034 --> 00:23:16.497
This is us, here.
Spur station here at Little Boston.

140
00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:19.625
The Sunday ranch
is what you're looking for.

141
00:23:19.708 --> 00:23:21.960
There's a sheep trail
that takes you there.

142
00:23:22.044 --> 00:23:25.047
It's a mile out of town headed west,
not far.

143
00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:29.051
Just through a small pass here
near the base of the hills.

144
00:23:29.176 --> 00:23:32.888
You'll pass a church
and just follow the sheep trail.

145
00:23:33.013 --> 00:23:37.184
- Where's Standard buying up?
- Here and here.

146
00:23:39.311 --> 00:23:41.772
- Your family name is Sunday, yes?
- That's right.

147
00:23:41.855 --> 00:23:43.357
How many's in your family?

148
00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.693
My father and mother and sisters
and my brother Eli.

149
00:23:46.777 --> 00:23:49.488
- How many sisters do you have?
- Two.

150
00:23:49.571 --> 00:23:51.907
- What's your name?
- Paul.

151
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:55.244
Does any of your family know
about the oil that you say is there?

152
00:23:55.327 --> 00:23:56.787
I don't know.

153
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:59.540
My uncle always said
there was oil there,

154
00:23:59.623 --> 00:24:02.125
but I don't know what they heard
or what they think.

155
00:24:02.209 --> 00:24:03.669
What do you grow?

156
00:24:03.752 --> 00:24:08.924
It's goats. It's a goat farm.
I told you, nothing grows but weeds.

157
00:24:09.007 --> 00:24:11.552
- Is there water?
- It's salty.

158
00:24:11.635 --> 00:24:15.055
You drill a well,
it's hard not to get saltwater.

159
00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:20.310
The oil is there. I'm telling you.

160
00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:28.151
- I want to go now, so...
- You can stay tonight.

161
00:24:28.277 --> 00:24:32.364
- No, I want to go now. I want to leave.
- Listen, Paul.

162
00:24:34.199 --> 00:24:38.996
If I travel all the way out there
and I find that you've been lying to me,

163
00:24:39.121 --> 00:24:41.766
I'm going to find you and I'm going
to take more than my money back.

164
00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:44.042
Is that all right with you?

165
00:24:44.126 --> 00:24:46.420
- Yes, sir.
- All right, then.

166
00:24:47.129 --> 00:24:51.300
- Nice luck to you. God bless.
- And to you, young man.

167
00:26:30.691 --> 00:26:32.734
- There's someone coming.
- Thank you, Mary.

168
00:26:42.411 --> 00:26:45.998
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

169
00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:51.795
My name's Daniel Plain view.
This is my son, H.W.

170
00:26:52.629 --> 00:26:55.424
- Are you hunting?
- Hunting for quail.

171
00:26:55.507 --> 00:26:58.385
We're told there might be a good place
to camp up near the Sunday ranch.

172
00:26:58.468 --> 00:27:00.345
This is the Sunday ranch.
You can camp here.

173
00:27:00.429 --> 00:27:03.181
- Thank you. Do you have water?
- Yes.

174
00:27:04.141 --> 00:27:06.244
We heard there was an earthquake
up here a few days ago.

175
00:27:06.268 --> 00:27:08.145
- Is that right?
- Yes.

176
00:27:08.979 --> 00:27:12.691
- Your family?
- Yeah, all fine. Thank you.

177
00:27:14.276 --> 00:27:17.779
- We have goat's milk, if you'd like.
- That would be fine.

178
00:27:19.781 --> 00:27:20.782
Now,

179
00:27:22.617 --> 00:27:26.705
if we set our tent away over there,
we'd be out of your way over there.

180
00:27:26.788 --> 00:27:28.081
That's fine.

181
00:27:28.165 --> 00:27:30.375
Ruth! Help these men
and bring them some water.

182
00:27:30.459 --> 00:27:31.960
No! H.W.

183
00:27:33.795 --> 00:27:37.299
Mr. Plain view,
would you like that milk now?

184
00:27:37.424 --> 00:27:41.511
- That would be fine. Thank you.
- Mary! Bring them some milk.

185
00:27:41.636 --> 00:27:43.114
My family will help you set up your tent.

186
00:27:43.138 --> 00:27:45.390
No, please.
We set ourselves on this camping trip.

187
00:27:45.474 --> 00:27:47.184
We have to do the camping.

188
00:27:47.309 --> 00:27:48.685
Hurry up!

189
00:27:51.646 --> 00:27:55.650
- Do you have bread?
- We have potatoes.

190
00:27:55.776 --> 00:27:57.402
Potatoes would be nice, thank you.

191
00:27:57.486 --> 00:27:59.086
I'll have them boil you up
some potatoes.

192
00:27:59.112 --> 00:28:01.406
That's all right.
I thought maybe we'd make a fire.

193
00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:03.742
I wanted to work with my son
on making a fire.

194
00:28:03.825 --> 00:28:05.827
All right. My son, Eli, will bring you
some wood.

195
00:28:05.911 --> 00:28:07.996
Thank you so much for your hospitality,
Mr. Sunday.

196
00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.123
- Yes.
- And we'll be out of your way.

197
00:28:10.207 --> 00:28:13.001
- We're just hunting for quail.
- Yes.

198
00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:17.089
- I'm sorry we don't have any bread.
- No, no, no.

199
00:28:17.172 --> 00:28:20.008
Corn doesn't fill out in the hills here.
It's mostly rock.

200
00:28:20.133 --> 00:28:22.969
We don't have room to raise the grain.

201
00:28:26.681 --> 00:28:28.767
Thank you, young lady.

202
00:28:53.959 --> 00:28:55.627
My name is Eli.

203
00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.922
Yes, you're Eli Sunday.

204
00:28:59.881 --> 00:29:01.341
Welcome.

205
00:29:05.011 --> 00:29:06.721
- H.W.
- Eli.

206
00:29:12.018 --> 00:29:15.147
- You're hunting quail?
- That's right.

207
00:29:19.401 --> 00:29:23.905
- We will bring dinner.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

208
00:30:45.987 --> 00:30:47.197
Dad!

209
00:30:47.864 --> 00:30:49.658
Dad, look at my shoe.

210
00:31:16.101 --> 00:31:18.770
That's earthquake oil. Set loose.

211
00:31:42.252 --> 00:31:43.586
So...

212
00:31:45.171 --> 00:31:46.381
So?

213
00:31:47.215 --> 00:31:48.633
So, so.

214
00:31:49.384 --> 00:31:52.721
If there's anything here,
we take it to the sea.

215
00:31:53.847 --> 00:31:57.600
What we do is we build a pipeline
to Port Hueneme or Santa Paula,

216
00:31:57.684 --> 00:31:59.227
it's about 100 miles,

217
00:31:59.311 --> 00:32:03.231
and we do a deal with Union Oil.
This is what we do.

218
00:32:03.732 --> 00:32:06.735
Then we don't need the railroads
and their shipping costs anymore.

219
00:32:06.818 --> 00:32:08.236
You see?

220
00:32:11.072 --> 00:32:12.115
Yeah.

221
00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.909
- You see that?
- Yeah.

222
00:32:15.952 --> 00:32:18.204
Then we're making money.
We're making the real money.

223
00:32:18.288 --> 00:32:20.165
What we should be making.
Not just...

224
00:32:20.248 --> 00:32:22.667
Not just throwing it away
on shipping costs.

225
00:32:22.751 --> 00:32:24.919
Otherwise, it's just mud.

226
00:32:29.132 --> 00:32:31.760
How much are we going to pay them?

227
00:32:32.594 --> 00:32:34.095
Who's that?

228
00:32:36.765 --> 00:32:38.600
The Sunday family.

229
00:32:39.142 --> 00:32:42.062
I'm not going to give them oil prices.

230
00:32:44.606 --> 00:32:46.900
I'll give them quail prices.

231
00:32:52.614 --> 00:32:54.240
If we could take a few minutes,

232
00:32:54.324 --> 00:32:57.494
there's something I'd very much
like to talk with you about.

233
00:32:57.619 --> 00:33:00.955
Mother, would you take the girls
outside, please?

234
00:33:13.134 --> 00:33:15.970
I believe in plain speaking, so...

235
00:33:16.054 --> 00:33:19.766
This is a beautiful ranch.
I love hunting for quail.

236
00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.686
My boy has been sick, you know.
He needs fresh air.

237
00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:27.023
Doctors all say
he needs plentiful fresh air.

238
00:33:28.817 --> 00:33:29.818
So,

239
00:33:32.404 --> 00:33:36.408
what would you say would be
a fair price for this lot, Abel?

240
00:33:37.492 --> 00:33:40.120
- To buy this place?
- That's right.

241
00:33:45.083 --> 00:33:46.918
Take a moment.

242
00:33:50.755 --> 00:33:54.509
- I'm sorry. I don't know.
- Six dollars an acre.

243
00:33:54.592 --> 00:33:58.054
Six dollars? Thank you, Eli.

244
00:33:58.179 --> 00:34:01.891
And then with the improvements
to the ranch over the years at $500...

245
00:34:02.016 --> 00:34:04.561
I'd like to offer you $3,700
for this ranch.

246
00:34:04.686 --> 00:34:07.272
- That's $3,700.
- No.

247
00:34:08.189 --> 00:34:10.483
The Lord has sent this man here, Eli.

248
00:34:10.567 --> 00:34:12.110
Yes, I believe He has.

249
00:34:12.193 --> 00:34:16.322
- My offer to you is $3,700.
- What is it that brought you here, sir?

250
00:34:17.490 --> 00:34:19.159
The Good Lord's guidance.

251
00:34:19.242 --> 00:34:20.678
- Now, of course, within that...
- What about our oil?

252
00:34:20.702 --> 00:34:22.370
...we're going to develop a lease.

253
00:34:23.663 --> 00:34:27.208
- What's that?
- What about our oil?

254
00:34:28.543 --> 00:34:30.003
What about it?

255
00:34:30.086 --> 00:34:32.297
We have oil here.
That's worth something.

256
00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:34.841
Do you have someone
who can drill for it?

257
00:34:34.924 --> 00:34:36.924
- Do you think there's oil here?
- I know there is.

258
00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:39.053
It's very expensive to drill.

259
00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:41.407
To get it up and out of the ground.
You ever tried that before?

260
00:34:41.431 --> 00:34:43.516
- How much is it?
- Costly.

261
00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:46.728
Well, our oil sits right up
on top of the ground.

262
00:34:47.729 --> 00:34:49.481
I believe that's called seepage.

263
00:34:49.564 --> 00:34:51.208
Doesn't necessarily mean
there's anything underneath.

264
00:34:51.232 --> 00:34:53.401
- What would you give us for it?
- I don't know.

265
00:34:53.485 --> 00:34:56.446
- Something you don't know.
- That's right.

266
00:34:59.741 --> 00:35:01.743
What would you like, Eli?

267
00:35:03.411 --> 00:35:05.747
Ten thousand dollars.

268
00:35:07.916 --> 00:35:09.417
For what?

269
00:35:11.377 --> 00:35:13.087
For my church.

270
00:35:23.014 --> 00:35:24.557
That's good.

271
00:35:27.519 --> 00:35:29.354
That's a good one.

272
00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:31.981
Well...

273
00:35:33.233 --> 00:35:36.861
If we decide to drill for oil
and if the well begins to produce,

274
00:35:36.945 --> 00:35:38.705
I'll give your church
a $5,000 signing bonus.

275
00:35:38.738 --> 00:35:39.738
Ten thousand.

276
00:35:39.781 --> 00:35:42.384
Do you want to find someone else
that's going to come here and drill, Eli?

277
00:35:42.408 --> 00:35:45.537
Make the investment and do
all the hard work that goes into it?

278
00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:49.541
I can just as easily hunt for quail
on another ranch as I can here, so...

279
00:35:49.624 --> 00:35:54.295
Though I'll happily be a supporter
of your church for as long as I can.

280
00:35:54.379 --> 00:35:56.214
For the bonus only.

281
00:35:57.966 --> 00:36:01.803
Now, as it happens, I do have some
connections in the drilling business

282
00:36:01.886 --> 00:36:06.474
who might help get us started.
How do you feel about this, Abel?

283
00:36:06.558 --> 00:36:08.476
Yes. What Eli says.

284
00:36:08.601 --> 00:36:11.771
Well, good! Let's draw up
some contracts and let's...

285
00:36:11.854 --> 00:36:13.815
Let's give it a try.

286
00:36:15.149 --> 00:36:17.986
Appreciate your help with this, Eli.

287
00:36:29.289 --> 00:36:30.915
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

288
00:36:30.999 --> 00:36:32.333
- Real estate?
- Yes.

289
00:36:32.458 --> 00:36:34.502
Yes, I'd like to talk to you.

290
00:36:34.586 --> 00:36:39.132
I'm looking for some land.
I just bought the Sunday ranch.

291
00:36:39.215 --> 00:36:43.303
And, well, where's the map?

292
00:36:43.845 --> 00:36:46.306
Where are the hills
behind the Sunday ranch?

293
00:36:46.389 --> 00:36:50.101
That's here. It's the Bandy tract.
He has over 600 acres.

294
00:36:50.184 --> 00:36:54.272
Bandy, 600.

295
00:36:54.355 --> 00:37:00.862
- What about this?
- A.C. Maude, Blodget, Red lick, Carr.

296
00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:05.575
- What's it held at?
- Six dollars an acre.

297
00:37:06.284 --> 00:37:07.619
Six.

298
00:37:07.702 --> 00:37:09.370
What about this?

299
00:37:09.454 --> 00:37:13.082
That's the Belvins,
and that could be got, I'm sure.

300
00:37:14.959 --> 00:37:17.712
Can everything around here be got?

301
00:37:18.421 --> 00:37:19.922
Sure.

302
00:37:44.238 --> 00:37:47.742
Paul Sunday turned out
to be a good friend of ours.

303
00:37:48.409 --> 00:37:50.036
That's right.

304
00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:56.376
Well, you get here just as soon
as you can. Bring Fred English.

305
00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:59.170
Good enough.

306
00:37:59.796 --> 00:38:01.589
Thank you, porter.

307
00:38:04.133 --> 00:38:06.803
- H.W., how are you?
- Fine, and you?

308
00:38:06.886 --> 00:38:08.656
- Pretty good. Where's your dad?
- He's inside.

309
00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.360
You fellas are a long way
from Signal Hill.

310
00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:12.392
- Hello, Plain view.
- Hello, Gene.

311
00:38:12.475 --> 00:38:15.019
- Good to see you.
- Charlie.

312
00:38:15.103 --> 00:38:19.691
- On your way somewhere else?
- Passing through. Looking around.

313
00:38:19.774 --> 00:38:22.318
- Funny to see you.
- Funny, isn't it?

314
00:38:22.443 --> 00:38:25.196
You boys are a regular family business.

315
00:38:25.279 --> 00:38:26.989
You boys are a little late.

316
00:38:27.115 --> 00:38:31.160
- What did you find?
- I found some interesting prospects.

317
00:38:31.285 --> 00:38:32.565
Did you hear Standard bought up?

318
00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:35.248
- Mostly in the north, so far.
- That's what I hear.

319
00:38:35.331 --> 00:38:38.793
I'm gonna tell you, Gene,
if you're gonna make a play, look east.

320
00:38:38.918 --> 00:38:44.173
I'd rather it be you than someone else.
This mud around here has been taken.

321
00:38:44.298 --> 00:38:47.844
It must be easy when you have such
a cute face to carry around with you.

322
00:38:47.969 --> 00:38:51.055
- Telling me how handsome my son is?
- Well, that I am.

323
00:38:51.139 --> 00:38:54.308
That's very nice. Thank you.
Good luck, Gene.

324
00:38:54.434 --> 00:38:56.894
- Take care.
- Like I said, go east.

325
00:38:56.978 --> 00:38:58.146
H.W.

326
00:38:59.147 --> 00:39:01.816
I'll be your lawyer
if you need to draw up a contract.

327
00:39:01.941 --> 00:39:06.237
Make sure you don't get swindled, boy.
Get half what your dad's making.

328
00:39:16.497 --> 00:39:18.124
How's that?

329
00:39:33.014 --> 00:39:35.224
What are those men doing?

330
00:39:37.518 --> 00:39:40.104
They're just guys
that are working for us.

331
00:39:40.188 --> 00:39:42.523
They're just looking around.

332
00:39:44.692 --> 00:39:46.986
How much money can we make?

333
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:53.367
I don't know. It depends.

334
00:39:57.538 --> 00:39:59.707
One thousand dollars?

335
00:40:07.507 --> 00:40:11.302
Mary said that her father beats her
if she doesn't pray.

336
00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:20.311
Mary, she's the smaller one?

337
00:40:22.939 --> 00:40:24.524
Yes, she is.

338
00:40:38.246 --> 00:40:40.832
- Everyone here?
- Very successful.

339
00:40:41.582 --> 00:40:42.625
But?

340
00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:46.128
There were a few vacant lots
and one holdout.

341
00:40:46.254 --> 00:40:47.880
- Who?
- William Bandy.

342
00:40:47.964 --> 00:40:50.049
...eight. Who's he?

343
00:40:50.132 --> 00:40:51.572
He's an old man
who homesteaded here.

344
00:40:51.634 --> 00:40:54.804
Lives with his grandson.
He said he'd like to speak with you.

345
00:40:54.929 --> 00:40:56.097
Is he here?

346
00:40:56.222 --> 00:40:59.267
No, he'd like you to come visit with him.

347
00:40:59.392 --> 00:41:01.102
He's boosting his price.

348
00:41:01.227 --> 00:41:05.022
He said he'd like to speak
with whoever is doing the buying.

349
00:41:05.106 --> 00:41:08.442
Well, let him wait. He'll come around.
Let's go.

350
00:41:15.449 --> 00:41:17.451
Ladies and gentlemen?

351
00:41:18.411 --> 00:41:20.454
Ladies and gentlemen.

352
00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:23.958
Thank you so much
for visiting with us this evening.

353
00:41:24.083 --> 00:41:27.670
Now, I've traveled across half our state
to be here and to see about this land.

354
00:41:30.715 --> 00:41:32.317
Now, I daresay some of you
might have heard

355
00:41:32.341 --> 00:41:36.220
some of the more extravagant rumors
about what my plans are,

356
00:41:36.304 --> 00:41:39.098
so I just thought
you'd like to hear it from me.

357
00:41:39.181 --> 00:41:42.101
This is the face. It's no great mystery.

358
00:41:44.937 --> 00:41:48.941
I'm an oilman, ladies and gentlemen,

359
00:41:49.775 --> 00:41:53.195
I have numerous concerns
spread across this state.

360
00:41:53.279 --> 00:41:56.699
I have many wells flowing
at many thousand barrels per day,

361
00:41:56.782 --> 00:41:59.785
so I like to think of myself as an oilman.

362
00:42:00.745 --> 00:42:02.580
As an oilman, I hope that you'll forgive

363
00:42:02.663 --> 00:42:05.583
just good old-fashioned plain speaking.

364
00:42:07.168 --> 00:42:10.755
Now, this work that we do
is very much a family enterprise.

365
00:42:10.838 --> 00:42:13.549
I work side by side
with my wonderful son, H. W.

366
00:42:13.633 --> 00:42:16.886
I think one or two of you
might have met him already.

367
00:42:16.969 --> 00:42:20.765
And I encourage my men
to bring their families, as well.

368
00:42:20.848 --> 00:42:24.852
Of course, it makes for an ever
so much more rewarding life for them.

369
00:42:24.936 --> 00:42:28.940
Family means children,
and children means education.

370
00:42:29.023 --> 00:42:32.735
So, wherever we set up camp,
education is a necessity,

371
00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:35.071
and we're just so happy
to take care of that.

372
00:42:35.196 --> 00:42:37.573
So let's build a wonderful school
in Little Boston.

373
00:42:37.698 --> 00:42:39.909
These children are the future
that we strive for,

374
00:42:40.034 --> 00:42:43.120
and so they should have
the very best of things.

375
00:42:43.204 --> 00:42:45.247
Now, something else,

376
00:42:45.373 --> 00:42:49.210
and please don't be insulted
if I speak about this. Bread.

377
00:42:49.335 --> 00:42:51.337
Let's talk about bread.

378
00:42:52.004 --> 00:42:55.383
Now, to my mind, it's an abomination
to consider

379
00:42:55.466 --> 00:42:59.720
that any man, woman, or child
in this magnificent country of ours

380
00:42:59.804 --> 00:43:03.307
should have to look upon
a loaf of bread as a luxury.

381
00:43:04.058 --> 00:43:07.687
We're going to dig water wells here,
and water wells means irrigation.

382
00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:10.189
Irrigation means cultivation.

383
00:43:10.272 --> 00:43:14.193
We're going to raise crops here where
before it just simply wasn't possible.

384
00:43:14.276 --> 00:43:16.797
You're going to have more grain
than you'll know what to do with,

385
00:43:16.821 --> 00:43:19.782
and bread will be coming right
out of your ears, ma'am.

386
00:43:19.865 --> 00:43:25.204
New roads, agriculture,
employment, education.

387
00:43:25.287 --> 00:43:27.327
These are just a few of the things
we can offer you,

388
00:43:27.373 --> 00:43:29.375
and I assure you,
ladies and gentlemen,

389
00:43:29.458 --> 00:43:31.669
that if we do find oil here,

390
00:43:31.752 --> 00:43:35.214
and I think there's a very good chance
that we will,

391
00:43:35.297 --> 00:43:39.844
this community of yours
will not only survive, it will flourish.

392
00:43:42.054 --> 00:43:45.099
I'd be happy to answer any questions
that you might have. Yes?

393
00:43:45.182 --> 00:43:47.727
Will the new road lead to the church?

394
00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:52.273
That'll be the first place that it leads.
Thank you, Eli. Anyone else?

395
00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:55.234
Well, if anything comes up,
I'm pretty easy to find.

396
00:43:55.317 --> 00:43:56.610
You just come visit with me.

397
00:43:56.694 --> 00:43:58.779
Thank you so much for your time,
and good night.

398
00:44:37.276 --> 00:44:42.281
What a privilege to carry

399
00:44:42.364 --> 00:44:46.285
everything to God in prayer!

400
00:44:47.203 --> 00:44:50.831
What a privilege to carry...

401
00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:10.017
Just follow the new road
right to the church.

402
00:45:10.101 --> 00:45:12.353
The new road will lead you there.

403
00:45:12.436 --> 00:45:14.146
Hello, brother, my name is Eli.

404
00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:17.817
The Church of the Third Revelation
welcomes you.

405
00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:19.652
Hello, brother, my name is Eli.

406
00:45:19.735 --> 00:45:22.071
The Church of the Third Revelation
welcomes you.

407
00:45:22.196 --> 00:45:25.241
Just follow the new road
right to the church.

408
00:45:34.041 --> 00:45:37.670
Jesus knows our every weakness.

409
00:45:39.463 --> 00:45:42.424
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

410
00:45:43.634 --> 00:45:47.847
Are we weak and heavy-laden.

411
00:45:48.848 --> 00:45:51.892
Cumbered with a load of care?

412
00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:56.230
Precious Savior still our refuge.

413
00:45:58.232 --> 00:46:00.860
Take it to the Lord in prayer...

414
00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:15.916
- Daniel, may I speak with you?
- Yes, come in.

415
00:46:18.043 --> 00:46:21.046
I'll bring them up when they arrive.

416
00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:23.382
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

417
00:46:23.465 --> 00:46:25.426
How is all the work coming?

418
00:46:25.509 --> 00:46:26.969
Everything's good.

419
00:46:27.052 --> 00:46:30.222
- All the men are provided for?
- Of course.

420
00:46:32.266 --> 00:46:34.143
Spirits seem high.

421
00:46:36.604 --> 00:46:40.065
Is there anything
that you need from me?

422
00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:47.406
- Anything the church can do for you?
- I don't believe so. No. Thank you.

423
00:46:47.489 --> 00:46:49.867
I understand you've asked the people
to gather around

424
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:51.636
and watch the well begin tomorrow.
Is that right?

425
00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:53.662
- That's right.
- I will bless the well.

426
00:46:55.414 --> 00:46:58.125
Before you begin,
you should introduce me.

427
00:46:58.209 --> 00:47:00.794
You'll see me walk up
towards the oil well, and when I...

428
00:47:00.878 --> 00:47:01.962
The derrick.

429
00:47:02.046 --> 00:47:05.883
You'll see me walk up,
and then you could say my name.

430
00:47:05.966 --> 00:47:08.135
When you walk up?

431
00:47:08.219 --> 00:47:12.139
Yes. You'll see me walk up,
and then you could say,

432
00:47:12.223 --> 00:47:17.394
"The proud son of these hills
who tended his Father's flock,"

433
00:47:17.603 --> 00:47:20.022
and then you could say my name.

434
00:47:21.315 --> 00:47:22.900
That's fine.

435
00:47:23.859 --> 00:47:27.321
- And what happens then?
- Well, then we start the drill.

436
00:47:30.449 --> 00:47:34.119
It's a simple blessing, Daniel,
but an important one.

437
00:47:34.203 --> 00:47:37.206
It's just a few words. It won't take long.

438
00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:41.418
- What time?
- What time's good for you, Eli?

439
00:47:41.502 --> 00:47:44.338
- 4:00.
- Well, let's make it 4:00 then.

440
00:47:45.422 --> 00:47:49.176
- My thanks for your visit.
- Good day. Thank you.

441
00:48:04.566 --> 00:48:06.568
Afternoon, everyone.

442
00:48:07.861 --> 00:48:09.530
Come with me.

443
00:48:14.868 --> 00:48:18.372
I thank you all so much
for visiting with us at this time.

444
00:48:18.497 --> 00:48:20.291
I've had the pleasure of
meeting some of you

445
00:48:20.374 --> 00:48:22.251
and I hope very much
in the months to come,

446
00:48:22.376 --> 00:48:25.546
I'll be able to visit with
each and every one of you.

447
00:48:25.671 --> 00:48:28.382
I'm better at digging holes in the
ground than making speeches,

448
00:48:28.465 --> 00:48:30.110
so let's forget the speech
for this evening,

449
00:48:30.134 --> 00:48:32.052
just make it a simple blessing.

450
00:48:32.177 --> 00:48:34.030
You see, one man doesn't prospect
from the ground.

451
00:48:34.054 --> 00:48:37.975
It takes a whole community of
good people, such as yourselves,

452
00:48:38.058 --> 00:48:41.103
and this is good. We stay together.

453
00:48:41.186 --> 00:48:42.980
We pray together, we work together,

454
00:48:43.063 --> 00:48:46.066
and if the Good Lord smiles kindly
on our endeavor,

455
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:48.652
we share in the wealth together.

456
00:48:51.071 --> 00:48:53.157
Now, before we spud in
Mary's Well Number One,

457
00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:56.410
named for the lovely
Miss Mary Sunday, here by my side,

458
00:48:56.493 --> 00:48:59.538
a proud daughter of these hills,

459
00:48:59.621 --> 00:49:03.375
I'd just like to say God bless these
honest labors of ours, and, of course,

460
00:49:03.459 --> 00:49:05.544
God bless you all.

461
00:49:05.627 --> 00:49:06.754
Amen.

462
00:49:06.837 --> 00:49:08.172
Now go.

463
00:49:13.093 --> 00:49:14.928
Won't be a minute.

464
00:49:17.931 --> 00:49:19.933
Fast as you can, H.W.

465
00:49:23.437 --> 00:49:25.606
Are you ready to do this?

466
00:49:35.407 --> 00:49:37.910
That's it, ladies and gentlemen!

467
00:49:41.789 --> 00:49:45.876
Al Rose has very generously provided
some refreshments for this occasion

468
00:49:45.959 --> 00:49:48.754
out of his own pocket. Thank you, Al.

469
00:49:49.463 --> 00:49:53.926
If you'll all just care to help yourselves,
I'll be back in a minute.

470
00:51:06.874 --> 00:51:08.417
Mary.

471
00:51:10.043 --> 00:51:11.712
Mary Sunday.

472
00:51:14.548 --> 00:51:17.301
- Do you like your new dress?
- Yes. Thank you.

473
00:51:17.384 --> 00:51:20.304
You're welcome. I thought you'd like it.

474
00:51:21.138 --> 00:51:23.724
- Are you happy I came here?
- Yes.

475
00:51:25.392 --> 00:51:29.104
Your daddy doesn't hit you anymore,
does he? Does he now?

476
00:51:29.938 --> 00:51:31.857
Better not, right?

477
00:51:32.483 --> 00:51:34.526
I'll take care of you.

478
00:51:35.569 --> 00:51:40.741
No more hitting, right?
No more hitting. Now go.

479
00:51:40.866 --> 00:51:43.911
Go and play some more
and don't come back.

480
00:51:53.003 --> 00:51:54.463
Daniel?

481
00:51:58.091 --> 00:52:02.304
It's okay, H.W. Go back to sleep.
Go on. Go back to sleep.

482
00:52:04.806 --> 00:52:06.016
Daniel.

483
00:52:08.393 --> 00:52:09.603
Daniel.

484
00:52:12.523 --> 00:52:13.815
Daniel!

485
00:52:15.359 --> 00:52:16.568
Daniel!

486
00:52:16.652 --> 00:52:17.945
What?

487
00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:21.949
Lost a man down the well.

488
00:52:26.453 --> 00:52:28.622
- What man?
- Joe Gundha.

489
00:52:30.582 --> 00:52:32.668
- Did I know him?
- No.

490
00:52:33.126 --> 00:52:34.253
What happened?

491
00:52:41.885 --> 00:52:43.303
Pick it up.

492
00:52:43.971 --> 00:52:45.556
Set the brake.

493
00:52:45.639 --> 00:52:47.975
- Tie it down.
- Tie it on.

494
00:52:52.563 --> 00:52:53.939
Shit!

495
00:52:55.983 --> 00:52:58.819
God damn it. Where's the body?

496
00:52:59.111 --> 00:53:02.155
- They're fishing it out now.
- All right.

497
00:53:05.492 --> 00:53:08.161
- Where's the bit?
- It's on the deck.

498
00:53:51.663 --> 00:53:54.541
Clean him up. Put some clothes on him.

499
00:53:55.626 --> 00:53:56.918
And...

500
00:53:58.545 --> 00:54:00.130
Set up a tent.

501
00:54:00.213 --> 00:54:04.217
Anyone goes down into the cellar,
you tell somebody. Yes?

502
00:54:04.801 --> 00:54:06.219
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

503
00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:12.225
Shut down till midday.

504
00:54:43.465 --> 00:54:48.887
And I had a vision.
Yes, last night, I had a vision

505
00:54:48.970 --> 00:54:51.932
and I felt God's breath
move through me.

506
00:54:55.519 --> 00:54:59.648
And it rolled down into my stomach.

507
00:55:01.608 --> 00:55:03.527
It sloshed around.

508
00:55:04.903 --> 00:55:08.782
And my stomach spoke in a whisper,
not a shout,

509
00:55:11.993 --> 00:55:16.248
"Touch this woman with your hands
and caress her." Yes.

510
00:55:20.585 --> 00:55:22.796
My dear Mrs. Hunter,

511
00:55:23.922 --> 00:55:26.299
you have arthritis, don't you?

512
00:55:26.383 --> 00:55:28.385
- Yes, I do, Eli.
- Yes.

513
00:55:28.468 --> 00:55:32.139
The devil is in your hands,
and I will suck it out.

514
00:55:33.265 --> 00:55:37.769
Now, I will not cast this ghost out
with a fever

515
00:55:37.853 --> 00:55:42.941
for the new spirit inside me has shown
me I have a new way to communicate.

516
00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:47.446
It is a gentle whisper.

517
00:55:53.785 --> 00:55:56.163
Get out of here, ghost.

518
00:55:58.707 --> 00:56:01.084
Get out of here, ghost.

519
00:56:03.086 --> 00:56:04.546
Get out.

520
00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:08.049
Get out of here, ghost.

521
00:56:10.385 --> 00:56:13.597
Get out of here, ghost.

522
00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:17.601
- ...and enter this woman's body now.
- Get out of here, ghost.

523
00:56:17.684 --> 00:56:22.564
Get out of here. Don't you dare turn
around and come back.

524
00:56:23.732 --> 00:56:25.442
For if you do,

525
00:56:25.525 --> 00:56:31.072
all the armies of my boot
will kick you in the teeth

526
00:56:31.198 --> 00:56:34.701
and you will be cast up
and thrown in the dirt

527
00:56:34.826 --> 00:56:37.204
and thrust back to perdition!

528
00:56:37.329 --> 00:56:41.041
And as long as I have teeth,
I will bite you,

529
00:56:41.166 --> 00:56:45.128
and if I have no teeth, I will gum you!

530
00:56:45.212 --> 00:56:48.965
And as long as I have fists,
I will bash you!

531
00:56:49.049 --> 00:56:53.845
Now, get out of here, ghost!
Get out of here, ghost!

532
00:56:53.929 --> 00:56:57.015
Get out of here, ghost!

533
00:57:00.143 --> 00:57:01.770
And it left!

534
00:57:02.521 --> 00:57:04.564
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

535
00:57:06.066 --> 00:57:08.527
- Praise the Lord and his holy days!
- Praise God!

536
00:57:08.610 --> 00:57:12.072
- Amen! Thank you.
- Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, God.

537
00:57:13.323 --> 00:57:15.534
My dear Mrs. Hunter.

538
00:57:19.079 --> 00:57:20.872
Dance with me.

539
00:57:28.088 --> 00:57:30.423
- Thanks for coming.
- It was a wonderful sermon.

540
00:57:30.507 --> 00:57:32.926
- Will I see you tomorrow?
- Yes.

541
00:57:37.931 --> 00:57:38.932
Eli.

542
00:57:41.434 --> 00:57:44.271
Had a tragedy at the well last night.

543
00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:47.190
Yes, I heard.

544
00:57:47.274 --> 00:57:49.693
Joe Gundha was a man
of considerable faith.

545
00:57:49.776 --> 00:57:54.030
So if you wish to say a few words,
his burial is at noon tomorrow.

546
00:57:54.114 --> 00:57:56.992
Daniel, this accident
could have been avoided.

547
00:57:57.117 --> 00:57:59.202
It is terrible to think of that well

548
00:57:59.286 --> 00:58:01.264
- working away out there...
- These men work in 12-hour shifts.

549
00:58:01.288 --> 00:58:02.390
- ...unblessed.
- They need their rest.

550
00:58:02.414 --> 00:58:04.225
If they don't have it,
they start to make stupid mistakes.

551
00:58:04.249 --> 00:58:07.103
I've seen the men drinking. Don't you
think that has something to do with this?

552
00:58:07.127 --> 00:58:08.688
We need these men well-rested
to bring in this well.

553
00:58:08.712 --> 00:58:10.940
They can't get that if they're up here
listening to your gospel,

554
00:58:10.964 --> 00:58:13.234
and then the well can't produce
and blow gold all over the place.

555
00:58:13.258 --> 00:58:15.260
I wish I had more time with Joe Gundha.

556
00:58:15.343 --> 00:58:16.595
More could have been done.

557
00:58:16.678 --> 00:58:21.725
Then the well can't produce
and blow gold all over the place.

558
00:58:28.023 --> 00:58:30.358
Now, would you see to it
that his personal possessions

559
00:58:30.442 --> 00:58:32.611
find their way
back to his family, please?

560
00:58:32.694 --> 00:58:34.195
Thank you.

561
00:58:34.696 --> 00:58:37.866
Heard you were planning
some renovations.

562
00:58:37.949 --> 00:58:40.952
Yes, our congregation
is growing strongly.

563
00:58:41.578 --> 00:58:46.082
- We need more room.
- That was one goddamn hell of a show.

564
00:58:47.167 --> 00:58:49.753
We were happy to have you, Daniel.

565
01:00:43.324 --> 01:00:45.118
Gas, gas, gas!

566
01:00:54.127 --> 01:00:57.297
Lights out! Wait here. Wait here.
Lights out!

567
01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:09.225
Put that fire out!

568
01:01:36.044 --> 01:01:39.839
Is he hurt? H.W.!
Hand him down to me!

569
01:01:44.385 --> 01:01:46.679
- Hand him down!
- Here.

570
01:01:50.767 --> 01:01:52.894
- Got him?
- I've got him!

571
01:02:00.193 --> 01:02:01.569
Oh, God.

572
01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:18.378
Come on.

573
01:02:30.515 --> 01:02:32.100
Open the door.

574
01:02:46.906 --> 01:02:49.659
Let go. There you go. You're safe.
You're safe.

575
01:02:50.577 --> 01:02:54.455
You're safe now. I got you here.
You're safe. Let go, son.

576
01:02:55.790 --> 01:02:58.710
Tell me where it hurts.
Tell me where it hurts. Tell me where...

577
01:02:58.793 --> 01:03:00.295
- Did you see this?
- No.

578
01:03:00.378 --> 01:03:01.462
Tell me where it hurts.

579
01:03:01.546 --> 01:03:04.132
Where does it hurt you?
Where does it hurt you?

580
01:03:04.215 --> 01:03:07.927
- I can't hear my voice.
- Were you hit in the head?

581
01:03:08.595 --> 01:03:13.141
Were you hit in the head? Tell me!
You have to tell me if you were!

582
01:03:13.224 --> 01:03:15.268
I can't hear my voice.

583
01:03:24.235 --> 01:03:26.988
I have to go and deal with this now.
You wait here for me.

584
01:03:27.071 --> 01:03:30.909
You understand? You wait here for me.
I'll be back. I'll be back in a minute.

585
01:03:30.992 --> 01:03:32.202
- Wait here.
- Don't leave!

586
01:03:32.285 --> 01:03:36.623
I'm going to take care of you. Wait.
Stay here, son. I'm going to fix this.

587
01:03:36.706 --> 01:03:37.808
- Don't leave!
- You're going to be fine!

588
01:03:37.832 --> 01:03:38.875
Wait for me here!

589
01:03:38.958 --> 01:03:41.961
- Hold him down. Hold him down.
- Don't leave!

590
01:03:44.172 --> 01:03:46.841
Got to break the cables, Daniel!

591
01:03:46.966 --> 01:03:48.843
Get me a hammer!

592
01:03:55.141 --> 01:03:56.976
Get me a hammer!

593
01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.272
Here you go.

594
01:04:26.547 --> 01:04:27.924
Get back!

595
01:05:05.545 --> 01:05:06.838
- Michael!
- Sir!

596
01:05:06.921 --> 01:05:09.382
Take Dave and two of the fellas,
pick up some hoses...

597
01:05:09.465 --> 01:05:13.428
Billy, protect the roof.
Don't wait before it gets too hot.

598
01:05:35.783 --> 01:05:38.453
What are you looking
so miserable about?

599
01:05:38.578 --> 01:05:41.414
There's a whole ocean of oil
under our feet!

600
01:05:41.539 --> 01:05:44.250
No one can get at it except for me.

601
01:06:30.922 --> 01:06:32.548
H.W. okay?

602
01:06:33.508 --> 01:06:35.134
No, he isn't.

603
01:06:37.345 --> 01:06:39.722
- Where is he?
- Mess room.

604
01:08:18.905 --> 01:08:22.575
That's enough now.
That's enough, H.W. That's enough.

605
01:08:25.203 --> 01:08:28.247
Do you hear me?
Can you hear me in there?

606
01:08:34.003 --> 01:08:35.755
That's enough.

607
01:08:48.059 --> 01:08:50.853
- Grab his legs.
- I have his legs.

608
01:08:50.937 --> 01:08:52.855
- No. Nope.
- No, lad.

609
01:08:58.486 --> 01:09:00.196
Give me that.

610
01:09:04.408 --> 01:09:05.493
Steady. That's it.

611
01:09:05.576 --> 01:09:07.995
- Easy, boy. Easy.
- Soon be over.

612
01:09:08.079 --> 01:09:11.874
Yeah, and that's good.
Now the other side. Turn him over.

613
01:09:15.795 --> 01:09:16.796
Almost done.

614
01:09:20.299 --> 01:09:21.801
That's it.

615
01:09:22.635 --> 01:09:25.471
Come here. It's over. It's over.

616
01:11:31.722 --> 01:11:34.392
Who do we know in San Francisco

617
01:11:35.935 --> 01:11:38.729
or Los Angeles, who could work with...

618
01:11:41.232 --> 01:11:44.985
You know, we could...
Someone, a teacher for H.W.

619
01:11:49.281 --> 01:11:51.659
How could you figure out that?

620
01:11:52.493 --> 01:11:56.539
Now, call...
God damn it, what's his name?

621
01:11:56.622 --> 01:11:58.958
Bob Brody in San Francisco?

622
01:12:00.126 --> 01:12:03.212
Call Bob Brody
and get someone down here.

623
01:12:09.802 --> 01:12:11.721
I'll do it right away.

624
01:13:19.330 --> 01:13:21.624
When do we get our money, Daniel?

625
01:13:27.630 --> 01:13:31.217
Aren't you a healer?
And a vessel for the Holy Spirit?

626
01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:34.345
When are you coming over
and make my son hear again?

627
01:13:34.428 --> 01:13:35.596
Can't you do that?

628
01:13:35.679 --> 01:13:37.741
If you had let me bless the well,
this wouldn't have happened.

629
01:13:37.765 --> 01:13:40.601
- Daniel.
- You shouldn't have done that.

630
01:13:41.936 --> 01:13:46.273
You owe the Church of
the Third Revelation $5,000

631
01:13:46.357 --> 01:13:49.235
as part of the arrangement
that we made!

632
01:13:58.994 --> 01:14:03.833
Don't even try it, you little runt!
You splash around in here.

633
01:14:10.673 --> 01:14:12.591
That's it, that's it.

634
01:14:24.645 --> 01:14:27.356
I'm going to bury you underground, Eli.

635
01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:33.988
I'm going to bury you underground.

636
01:15:05.519 --> 01:15:08.314
You are a stupid man, Abel.

637
01:15:10.149 --> 01:15:14.820
You've let someone come in here
and walk all over us.

638
01:15:16.947 --> 01:15:21.410
You let him in and do his work here,

639
01:15:21.493 --> 01:15:25.539
and you are a stupid man
for what we could have had.

640
01:15:25.664 --> 01:15:29.585
I followed His word, Eli. I tried.

641
01:15:29.668 --> 01:15:32.463
You didn't do anything but sit down.

642
01:15:33.797 --> 01:15:36.300
You're lazy, and you're stupid.

643
01:15:39.970 --> 01:15:44.141
Do you think God is going
to save you for being stupid?

644
01:15:46.769 --> 01:15:49.355
He doesn't save stupid people, Abel.

645
01:15:52.691 --> 01:15:57.196
I will tear you apart for
what you've done, you stupid man!

646
01:15:57.279 --> 01:15:59.615
How did he come here?
Do you really know? I know!

647
01:15:59.698 --> 01:16:02.368
- Son, don't do this, please!
- Be quiet!

648
01:16:02.451 --> 01:16:07.539
Shut your mouth, Abel!
It was your stupid son!

649
01:16:07.623 --> 01:16:11.585
It was Paul who told him to come here.
I know it.

650
01:16:11.669 --> 01:16:13.420
He went to him and he said,

651
01:16:13.504 --> 01:16:18.258
"My stupid, weak father
will give away his lots.

652
01:16:18.342 --> 01:16:21.845
"Go and take him."
And you let it happen.

653
01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:29.520
A stupid father to a stupid son.

654
01:16:35.109 --> 01:16:36.819
Get out of there!

655
01:17:07.474 --> 01:17:09.143
Can I help you?

656
01:17:10.686 --> 01:17:12.229
Daniel?

657
01:17:12.312 --> 01:17:16.108
- Who's that?
- My name is Henry.

658
01:17:17.026 --> 01:17:18.444
Yeah?

659
01:17:19.611 --> 01:17:21.030
I'm Henry.

660
01:17:22.531 --> 01:17:24.616
What can I do for you?

661
01:17:27.453 --> 01:17:31.290
I'm Henry Plain view.
I'm from Fond Du Lac.

662
01:17:33.792 --> 01:17:37.629
I'm your brother, from another mother.

663
01:17:39.882 --> 01:17:41.800
Ernest is my father.

664
01:17:46.096 --> 01:17:47.639
Who are you?

665
01:17:48.974 --> 01:17:50.267
Henry.

666
01:18:17.294 --> 01:18:21.799
- Mary Branch? Is that your mother?
- Yes, sir, that's right.

667
01:18:24.009 --> 01:18:29.181
I read about your gusher in the paper,
about your success.

668
01:18:29.306 --> 01:18:32.351
You heard about my strike?
You just show up?

669
01:18:33.352 --> 01:18:35.187
Our father's dead.

670
01:18:36.772 --> 01:18:40.025
Ernest died, I heard.
I wanted to find you.

671
01:18:40.109 --> 01:18:41.777
When?

672
01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:45.489
Three months ago.
I got a letter from Annabelle.

673
01:18:46.448 --> 01:18:48.367
My sister, Annabelle?

674
01:18:50.327 --> 01:18:54.039
- Where is she?
- Still at home. Fond Du Lac.

675
01:18:55.707 --> 01:18:59.211
You came all the way
from Wisconsin to tell me this?

676
01:18:59.336 --> 01:19:02.381
I'm coming from New Mexico.
I've been there.

677
01:19:03.549 --> 01:19:05.467
I came to find you.

678
01:19:06.552 --> 01:19:08.679
Did you know about me?

679
01:19:16.728 --> 01:19:18.981
Do you have identification?

680
01:19:19.606 --> 01:19:21.733
Do you have this letter?

681
01:19:44.882 --> 01:19:46.967
- Where are you coming from?
- From New Mexico.

682
01:19:47.050 --> 01:19:49.553
Yes, I know, but from where?

683
01:19:49.636 --> 01:19:52.723
Silver City.
I've been there for two years.

684
01:19:53.765 --> 01:19:58.604
I was trying drilling of my own for years.

685
01:19:58.687 --> 01:20:05.110
- Getting leases in Texas. Louisiana.
- Anything that produced?

686
01:20:05.194 --> 01:20:08.238
No. Not like your success, no.

687
01:20:14.703 --> 01:20:17.164
- Are you married?
- No.

688
01:20:17.623 --> 01:20:21.668
I spent time in jail.
I had a stretch of very bad time.

689
01:20:22.294 --> 01:20:25.547
I had nothing.
I was picked up in Louisiana.

690
01:20:27.007 --> 01:20:30.677
I worked on a chain gang
for six months building roads.

691
01:20:31.178 --> 01:20:34.389
That was a very hard time.

692
01:20:38.143 --> 01:20:39.978
Are you married?

693
01:20:41.188 --> 01:20:43.649
What were you in jail for?

694
01:20:43.732 --> 01:20:48.278
Believe it or not, for all the
terrible things I've gotten myself into,

695
01:20:48.362 --> 01:20:51.907
when they picked me up,
I hadn't done anything.

696
01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:55.827
But I've done my share of things

697
01:20:58.121 --> 01:21:00.540
that shouldn't be talked about.

698
01:21:23.021 --> 01:21:26.108
Drink it. Drink it!

699
01:22:08.650 --> 01:22:09.985
Come on.

700
01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:42.934
So...

701
01:22:47.731 --> 01:22:49.524
What do you want, Henry?

702
01:22:51.943 --> 01:22:53.362
Nothing.

703
01:22:56.448 --> 01:23:00.660
If you can spare something,
I can work for you in any way.

704
01:23:00.786 --> 01:23:05.123
I know I'll keep moving, before long,
to get back to Fond Du Lac.

705
01:23:06.124 --> 01:23:08.460
- Do you have any money?
- Some.

706
01:23:09.544 --> 01:23:11.713
- Not much.
- Just answer me directly.

707
01:23:11.797 --> 01:23:15.425
You say "nothing," then you say
you'd like to stay and work.

708
01:23:15.509 --> 01:23:20.472
And it's better, I'd just like to hear
you say you'd like to be here.

709
01:23:21.598 --> 01:23:23.517
I'd like to be here.

710
01:23:28.814 --> 01:23:34.486
I'm a good worker.
I worked cable tool rigs, built railroads.

711
01:23:36.613 --> 01:23:38.657
I won't need any favors.

712
01:23:43.662 --> 01:23:44.830
Good.

713
01:24:10.647 --> 01:24:12.858
What did my mother know?

714
01:24:15.402 --> 01:24:17.112
I don't know.

715
01:24:17.654 --> 01:24:22.200
I don't know if she knew and looked
the other way, if she never knew.

716
01:24:24.911 --> 01:24:26.705
Why did you leave?

717
01:24:28.623 --> 01:24:31.626
I know you didn't get on with our father.

718
01:24:36.798 --> 01:24:40.552
I worked for Geological Survey
and went to Kansas.

719
01:24:42.971 --> 01:24:46.057
I couldn't stay there. I just couldn't.

720
01:24:47.726 --> 01:24:50.312
I don't like to explain myself.

721
01:24:56.318 --> 01:25:00.572
- Are you an angry man, Henry?
- About what?

722
01:25:01.406 --> 01:25:05.202
Are you envious? Do you get envious?

723
01:25:06.453 --> 01:25:08.413
I don't think so, no.

724
01:25:12.876 --> 01:25:15.253
I have a competition in me.

725
01:25:16.421 --> 01:25:18.882
I want no one else to succeed.

726
01:25:23.887 --> 01:25:28.433
- I hate most people.
- That part of me is gone.

727
01:25:29.601 --> 01:25:32.521
Working and not succeeding,

728
01:25:32.604 --> 01:25:36.608
all my failures have left me...

729
01:25:39.611 --> 01:25:41.530
I just don't care.

730
01:25:43.198 --> 01:25:45.825
Well, if it's in me, it's in you.

731
01:25:47.327 --> 01:25:52.791
There are times when I look at people
and I see nothing worth liking.

732
01:25:58.755 --> 01:26:02.801
I want to earn enough money
I can get away from everyone.

733
01:26:07.806 --> 01:26:10.308
What will you do about your boy?

734
01:26:18.024 --> 01:26:19.693
I don't know.

735
01:26:21.194 --> 01:26:23.655
Maybe it'll change.

736
01:26:23.822 --> 01:26:28.243
Does your sound come back to you?
I don't know. Maybe no one knows that.

737
01:26:28.326 --> 01:26:32.539
- Doctor might not know that.
- Where's his mother?

738
01:26:38.503 --> 01:26:41.548
I don't want to talk about those things.

739
01:26:44.843 --> 01:26:47.137
I see the worst in people, Henry.

740
01:26:49.139 --> 01:26:53.018
I don't need to look past seeing them
to get all I need.

741
01:26:55.145 --> 01:26:59.149
I've built up my hatreds over the years,
little by little.

742
01:27:02.819 --> 01:27:06.197
Having you here
gives me a second breath of life.

743
01:27:07.365 --> 01:27:10.035
I can't keep doing this on my own

744
01:27:13.288 --> 01:27:18.376
with these people.

745
01:27:58.166 --> 01:28:00.752
Daniel! Daniel, wake up! Daniel!

746
01:29:43.021 --> 01:29:46.524
Just have to go and have a word
with the conductor.

747
01:29:47.275 --> 01:29:49.402
I'll be right back.

748
01:29:49.527 --> 01:29:54.240
You stay here. You understand?
You stay here.

749
01:29:55.283 --> 01:29:57.160
I'll be right back.

750
01:30:49.838 --> 01:30:51.714
No! No!

751
01:30:53.383 --> 01:30:54.634
No!

752
01:31:04.435 --> 01:31:06.020
- Tilford!
- Plain view.

753
01:31:06.104 --> 01:31:08.439
This is my brother,
Henry Plain view from Fond Du Lac.

754
01:31:08.523 --> 01:31:10.191
H.M. Tilford. Pleasure.

755
01:31:10.275 --> 01:31:12.777
Henry Plain view. J.J. Carter.

756
01:31:14.779 --> 01:31:16.197
So...

757
01:31:16.281 --> 01:31:17.949
- Shall we?
- Yes.

758
01:31:26.124 --> 01:31:28.334
How's your boy?

759
01:31:28.459 --> 01:31:31.838
- Thank you for asking.
- Is there anything we can do?

760
01:31:31.963 --> 01:31:34.382
Thanks for asking is enough.

761
01:31:36.009 --> 01:31:38.052
So what are your plans?

762
01:31:39.804 --> 01:31:43.057
Is this about buying up my tracts here?

763
01:31:43.141 --> 01:31:44.225
Yes.

764
01:31:44.309 --> 01:31:47.186
The cable was
about my Coyote Hills lease.

765
01:31:47.312 --> 01:31:51.482
- We'd like that, too.
- What's your offer on Coyote Hills?

766
01:31:51.608 --> 01:31:56.195
- We'll offer 150,000 for full title.
- That's a deal. What's next?

767
01:31:56.988 --> 01:32:01.576
You have 11,000 acres in Little Boston.
You have one proven well

768
01:32:01.659 --> 01:32:03.304
- that was damaged...
- I have three wells proven.

769
01:32:03.328 --> 01:32:07.415
You haven't been paying attention.
That's three proven wells.

770
01:32:11.669 --> 01:32:13.647
We'll make you a millionaire
while you're sitting here

771
01:32:13.671 --> 01:32:16.007
from one minute to the next.

772
01:32:17.842 --> 01:32:20.637
And what else would I do with myself?

773
01:32:22.347 --> 01:32:26.726
- Are you asking me?
- What else would I do with myself?

774
01:32:27.352 --> 01:32:29.479
Take care of your son.

775
01:32:31.105 --> 01:32:33.608
I don't know what you would do.

776
01:32:36.194 --> 01:32:38.696
If you were me and Standard
offered to buy what you had

777
01:32:38.780 --> 01:32:41.491
for a million dollars, why? So, why?

778
01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:43.826
You know why.

779
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:45.846
Yeah, you fellas
should just scratch around in the dirt

780
01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:49.332
and find it like the rest of us, instead of
buying up someone else's hard work.

781
01:32:49.415 --> 01:32:51.376
I've scratched around the dirt, son.

782
01:32:51.459 --> 01:32:53.503
You going to change
your shipping costs?

783
01:32:53.586 --> 01:32:56.589
We don't dictate shipping costs.
That's railroad business.

784
01:32:57.590 --> 01:33:00.259
You don't own the railroads?

785
01:33:04.222 --> 01:33:06.849
'Course you do. Of course you do.

786
01:33:08.518 --> 01:33:10.979
Where you going to put it all?

787
01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:13.439
Where?

788
01:33:15.233 --> 01:33:19.278
Build a pipeline? Make a deal
with Union Oil? Be my guest.

789
01:33:19.404 --> 01:33:21.072
But if you can't pull it off,

790
01:33:21.155 --> 01:33:25.284
you've got an ocean of oil
under your feet with nowhere to go.

791
01:33:26.244 --> 01:33:30.915
Why not turn it over to us?
We'll make you rich.

792
01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:33.376
You spend time with your boy.

793
01:33:34.419 --> 01:33:36.587
It's a great discovery.

794
01:33:37.463 --> 01:33:39.590
Now, let us help you.

795
01:33:48.766 --> 01:33:51.936
Did you just tell me
how to run my family?

796
01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:54.331
It might be more important now
that you've proven the field

797
01:33:54.355 --> 01:33:56.274
and we're offering to buy you out.

798
01:33:56.357 --> 01:33:58.609
One night I'm going to come to you,
inside of your house,

799
01:33:58.693 --> 01:34:01.696
or wherever you're sleeping,
and I'm going to cut your throat.

800
01:34:01.779 --> 01:34:02.947
What?

801
01:34:03.698 --> 01:34:05.050
What are you talking about?
Have you gone crazy?

802
01:34:05.074 --> 01:34:06.468
- Did you hear what I said?
- I heard what you said,

803
01:34:06.492 --> 01:34:08.995
- why did you say it?
- You don't tell me about my son.

804
01:34:09.078 --> 01:34:11.348
Why are you acting insane
and threatening to cut my throat?

805
01:34:11.372 --> 01:34:14.459
- You don't tell me about my son.
- I'm not telling you anything!

806
01:34:14.542 --> 01:34:18.379
I'm asking you to be reasonable.
If I've offended you, I apologize.

807
01:34:18.463 --> 01:34:20.673
You'll see what I can do.

808
01:34:28.514 --> 01:34:32.769
This parcel here is the 3,000-acre
ranch owned by B.L. Harper.

809
01:34:32.852 --> 01:34:35.396
This is San Luis Obispo County land.

810
01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:37.356
And from here to the coast,
it's all Union Oil.

811
01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:40.610
What's this? Why don't I own this?

812
01:34:43.529 --> 01:34:48.159
- Why don't I own this?
- That's the Bandy tract.

813
01:34:48.910 --> 01:34:52.080
He was the holdout,
when we were doing the buying.

814
01:34:52.163 --> 01:34:54.665
He had hoped to speak with you.

815
01:34:58.836 --> 01:35:02.340
Can't you just build the pipeline
around this tract?

816
01:35:05.301 --> 01:35:09.347
Can I build around 50 miles
of Tehachapi mountains?

817
01:35:09.472 --> 01:35:12.016
Don't be thick in front of me, Al.

818
01:35:12.642 --> 01:35:16.354
- I can go to him again.
- No, I'll go and talk to the man.

819
01:35:16.479 --> 01:35:19.398
I'll talk to him. Show you how it's done.

820
01:35:23.194 --> 01:35:25.696
All right. Pack it up, Henry.

821
01:35:35.998 --> 01:35:39.919
- How big is his room?
- He's sharing with another boy.

822
01:35:40.044 --> 01:35:42.880
- Who?
- An older boy. About 12.

823
01:35:42.964 --> 01:35:46.050
He's been there for a year.
Named Ballard.

824
01:35:51.222 --> 01:35:55.643
- How big is the room?
- It's a fair size. Got enough space.

825
01:35:57.895 --> 01:36:01.190
Are you taking Henry with you
to meet Union Oil?

826
01:36:14.412 --> 01:36:17.999
- Are you the son of William Bandy?
- Grandson.

827
01:36:18.082 --> 01:36:19.917
- Is he here?
- No, he's out.

828
01:36:20.001 --> 01:36:21.085
Where is he?

829
01:36:21.210 --> 01:36:24.088
Told you, he's out.
Now, what do you want?

830
01:36:27.592 --> 01:36:31.512
I'm Daniel Plain view. I want to talk
with him about his property.

831
01:36:31.596 --> 01:36:36.517
- About what?
- I believe I'll talk with him about that.

832
01:36:36.934 --> 01:36:39.437
- You're that oilman, aren't you?
- That's right.

833
01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:41.522
We don't want you drilling out here.

834
01:36:41.606 --> 01:36:45.026
I don't want it either.
Now, when will he be back?

835
01:36:45.109 --> 01:36:46.194
Few days.

836
01:36:46.277 --> 01:36:48.863
Tell him I'd like to speak with him.
Not about drilling.

837
01:36:48.946 --> 01:36:51.240
And I'll be back in a week.

838
01:39:10.254 --> 01:39:12.423
Put that in a glass case.

839
01:39:13.299 --> 01:39:15.217
Here's to Union Oil.

840
01:39:15.885 --> 01:39:16.969
Hundred miles of pipeline,

841
01:39:17.094 --> 01:39:19.513
and all the independent producers
of this great state.

842
01:39:19.597 --> 01:39:20.598
Cheers.

843
01:39:45.790 --> 01:39:48.501
There's that house in Fond Du Lac

844
01:39:50.378 --> 01:39:53.672
that John Hollister built.
Do you remember it?

845
01:39:56.509 --> 01:39:59.970
I thought as a boy that was
the most beautiful house I'd ever seen,

846
01:40:00.054 --> 01:40:01.722
and I wanted it.

847
01:40:02.431 --> 01:40:04.934
I wanted to live in it.

848
01:40:05.017 --> 01:40:06.602
And eat in it.

849
01:40:07.395 --> 01:40:09.021
And clean it.

850
01:40:11.982 --> 01:40:16.320
And even as a boy, I wanted
to have children to run around in it.

851
01:40:17.988 --> 01:40:20.783
You can have
anything you'd like now, Daniel.

852
01:40:21.450 --> 01:40:23.119
And you should.

853
01:40:23.828 --> 01:40:28.541
- Where are you going to build it?
- Here, maybe. Near the ocean.

854
01:40:31.460 --> 01:40:34.255
Would you make it look like that house?

855
01:40:38.968 --> 01:40:42.471
I think if I saw that house now,
it'd make me sick.

856
01:40:48.853 --> 01:40:51.355
We can eat and get some women.

857
01:40:54.316 --> 01:40:56.485
Take them to the Peach tree dance.

858
01:41:00.197 --> 01:41:04.160
I say get liquored up and take them
to the Peach tree dance.

859
01:41:06.996 --> 01:41:08.247
Yeah.

860
01:42:27.159 --> 01:42:29.620
Can I have some money, please?

861
01:42:36.961 --> 01:42:39.463
Can I have some money, please?

862
01:43:28.470 --> 01:43:31.015
I want you to tell me something.

863
01:43:34.643 --> 01:43:35.853
What?

864
01:43:36.854 --> 01:43:40.357
What's the name of the farm
next to the Hill House?

865
01:43:51.368 --> 01:43:56.081
What was the name of the farm
next to the Hill House?

866
01:43:59.585 --> 01:44:02.630
- I can't remember...
- Who are you?

867
01:44:05.549 --> 01:44:07.426
I'll leave, Daniel.

868
01:44:09.178 --> 01:44:10.763
Who are you?

869
01:44:14.058 --> 01:44:15.643
I'm no one.

870
01:44:16.685 --> 01:44:18.979
Just let me get up and go.

871
01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:23.359
Do I have a brother?

872
01:44:27.279 --> 01:44:32.534
I met a man in King City
who said he was your brother.

873
01:44:35.037 --> 01:44:38.165
We were friends for months.

874
01:44:39.583 --> 01:44:41.585
Working in King City.

875
01:44:43.754 --> 01:44:46.715
And he wanted
to make his way to you, Daniel.

876
01:44:47.925 --> 01:44:50.094
We didn't have any money.

877
01:44:54.932 --> 01:44:57.267
He died of tuberculosis.

878
01:44:58.644 --> 01:45:00.521
He wasn't harmed.

879
01:45:01.522 --> 01:45:03.774
Wasn't killed, nothing bad.

880
01:45:05.609 --> 01:45:07.861
But he told me about you,

881
01:45:10.864 --> 01:45:13.200
and I just took his story,

882
01:45:16.870 --> 01:45:18.706
used his diary.

883
01:45:22.292 --> 01:45:23.293
Daniel.

884
01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:28.298
Daniel, I'm your friend.

885
01:45:30.467 --> 01:45:32.928
I'm not trying to hurt you.

886
01:45:33.011 --> 01:45:34.304
Never.

887
01:45:35.389 --> 01:45:36.974
Just survive.

888
01:45:37.474 --> 01:45:38.726
No!

889
01:48:48.332 --> 01:48:49.833
Who is it?

890
01:48:51.084 --> 01:48:52.586
I'm Bandy.

891
01:49:05.349 --> 01:49:07.225
Yes. Yes.

892
01:49:09.686 --> 01:49:11.480
William Bandy.

893
01:49:14.650 --> 01:49:17.319
Yeah, I'd like to lease your land.

894
01:49:19.696 --> 01:49:23.283
I had asked for you
to come and talk to me before.

895
01:49:23.367 --> 01:49:25.702
When you were leasing land.

896
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:28.705
That's right, yes.

897
01:49:30.374 --> 01:49:32.960
My boy's been very sick, you know.

898
01:49:34.044 --> 01:49:36.630
This was before your boy got sick.

899
01:49:39.716 --> 01:49:44.262
Now, I know
that you would like to build a pipeline

900
01:49:44.388 --> 01:49:47.057
through my property.

901
01:49:47.140 --> 01:49:51.311
- Is that right, what I've heard?
- It's absolutely right. And,

902
01:49:51.979 --> 01:49:52.980
well...

903
01:49:54.231 --> 01:49:57.567
Eight inch pipe.
It could be buried with your consent.

904
01:49:57.651 --> 01:50:00.237
I guarantee you
absolutely no disruption...

905
01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:01.530
God.

906
01:50:03.365 --> 01:50:05.993
God has told me what you must do.

907
01:50:10.330 --> 01:50:12.082
And what is that?

908
01:50:13.041 --> 01:50:16.962
You should be washed
in the blood of Jesus Christ.

909
01:50:18.755 --> 01:50:20.716
But I am.

910
01:50:22.217 --> 01:50:24.928
I have been washed, Mr. Bandy.
I have been.

911
01:50:25.053 --> 01:50:30.767
It's your only way to salvation.
And your only way for what you want.

912
01:50:32.602 --> 01:50:36.189
You can take it at
the Church of the Third Revelation.

913
01:50:38.608 --> 01:50:40.610
I'll pay you $3,000.

914
01:50:43.196 --> 01:50:45.991
I'd like you to be part of our church.

915
01:50:47.868 --> 01:50:49.786
I'll pay you $5,000.

916
01:50:50.871 --> 01:50:52.372
Be baptized.

917
01:50:53.707 --> 01:50:57.586
Be forgiven for the sin that you've done.

918
01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:06.720
What sin are you referring to,
Mr. Bandy?

919
01:51:07.846 --> 01:51:09.765
My sin of drilling?

920
01:52:00.482 --> 01:52:04.528
I truly wish everyone could be saved,
don't you?

921
01:52:04.611 --> 01:52:06.530
Yes.

922
01:52:06.613 --> 01:52:09.366
I am afraid that's just not the case.

923
01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:14.704
The doctrine of universal salvation
is a lie, is it not?

924
01:52:14.830 --> 01:52:17.457
- It's a lie.
- It's a lie.

925
01:52:17.541 --> 01:52:22.379
I wish everyone could be saved,
but they won't. No, they won't.

926
01:52:22.462 --> 01:52:25.966
You will never be saved if you...

927
01:52:26.049 --> 01:52:28.051
Reject the blood.

928
01:52:28.844 --> 01:52:30.053
Good.

929
01:52:31.054 --> 01:52:35.559
Now, is there a sinner here
looking for salvation?

930
01:52:38.228 --> 01:52:39.855
A new member?

931
01:52:44.276 --> 01:52:46.069
I'll ask it again.

932
01:52:48.071 --> 01:52:50.782
Is there a sinner here looking for God?

933
01:52:50.907 --> 01:52:52.075
Yes.

934
01:52:56.163 --> 01:52:57.622
Allow me.

935
01:52:59.833 --> 01:53:02.627
Thank you for coming, brother Daniel.

936
01:53:04.754 --> 01:53:06.423
Thank you, Eli.

937
01:53:07.507 --> 01:53:12.637
We have a sinner with us here
who wishes for salvation!

938
01:53:12.721 --> 01:53:16.349
- Daniel, are you a sinner?
- Yes.

939
01:53:16.433 --> 01:53:19.144
The Lord can't hear you, Daniel.

940
01:53:19.227 --> 01:53:23.106
Say it to him. Go ahead
and speak to him. It's all right.

941
01:53:23.857 --> 01:53:26.193
- Yes.
- Down on your knees.

942
01:53:26.276 --> 01:53:27.861
Pray to him.

943
01:53:29.237 --> 01:53:33.617
Look up to the sky and say it.

944
01:53:36.203 --> 01:53:38.413
What do you want me to say?

945
01:53:39.414 --> 01:53:43.919
Daniel, you've come here and
you've brought good and wealth,

946
01:53:44.002 --> 01:53:48.215
but you have also brought
your bad habits as a backslider.

947
01:53:48.298 --> 01:53:52.594
You've lusted after women,
and you have abandoned your child.

948
01:53:52.677 --> 01:53:55.764
Your child, that you raised,
you have abandoned

949
01:53:55.847 --> 01:53:58.308
all because he was sick
and you have sinned.

950
01:53:58.433 --> 01:54:00.602
So say it now. I am a sinner.

951
01:54:00.685 --> 01:54:02.604
- I am a sinner.
- Say it louder.

952
01:54:02.687 --> 01:54:05.482
- I am a sinner.
- I am a sinner.

953
01:54:05.565 --> 01:54:07.484
Louder, Daniel! I am a sinner!

954
01:54:07.609 --> 01:54:10.570
- I am a sinner.
- I am sorry, Lord.

955
01:54:10.654 --> 01:54:12.822
- I am sorry, Lord.
- I want the blood.

956
01:54:12.948 --> 01:54:16.326
- I want the blood.
- You have abandoned your child.

957
01:54:17.077 --> 01:54:18.411
I have abandoned my child.

958
01:54:18.495 --> 01:54:20.830
- I will never backslide.
- I will never backslide.

959
01:54:20.956 --> 01:54:24.000
I was lost, but now I am found.

960
01:54:24.084 --> 01:54:28.004
- I was lost, but now I'm found.
- I have abandoned my child.

961
01:54:29.756 --> 01:54:32.926
Say it. Say it.

962
01:54:33.009 --> 01:54:36.096
- I abandoned my child.
- Say it louder. Say it louder!

963
01:54:36.179 --> 01:54:38.306
I've abandoned my child!

964
01:54:39.182 --> 01:54:41.726
I've abandoned my child!

965
01:54:41.851 --> 01:54:43.853
I've abandoned my boy!

966
01:54:43.979 --> 01:54:46.398
Now beg for the blood!

967
01:54:47.565 --> 01:54:49.502
Just give me the blood, Eli.
Let me get out of here.

968
01:54:49.526 --> 01:54:52.320
Give me the blood, Lord,
and let me get away!

969
01:54:52.404 --> 01:54:56.199
Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your Lord and Savior?

970
01:54:56.324 --> 01:54:59.077
- Yes, I do.
- Get out of here, devil!

971
01:54:59.202 --> 01:55:02.038
Out, devil! Out, sin!

972
01:55:02.163 --> 01:55:04.708
- Let me feel the power of the Lord, Eli.
- Do you accept

973
01:55:04.833 --> 01:55:08.712
the Church of the Third Revelation
as your spiritual guide?

974
01:55:10.213 --> 01:55:14.467
- Get out of here, ghost!
- Where is your Lord, Eli?

975
01:55:14.551 --> 01:55:18.680
- Get out! Go back where you belong!
- Where is he? There he is!

976
01:55:18.763 --> 01:55:22.392
Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your Savior?

977
01:55:22.475 --> 01:55:23.935
Yes, I do.

978
01:55:26.688 --> 01:55:31.026
Would you be free
from the burden of sin?

979
01:55:31.109 --> 01:55:33.486
There's power in the blood.

980
01:55:33.570 --> 01:55:35.655
Power in the blood.

981
01:55:35.905 --> 01:55:37.699
Would you o'er evil a victory win?

982
01:55:37.782 --> 01:55:40.035
There's a pipeline.

983
01:55:40.118 --> 01:55:44.331
There's wonderful power in the blood.

984
01:55:44.414 --> 01:55:48.835
There is power, power
wonder-working power.

985
01:55:48.918 --> 01:55:52.630
In the blood of the Lamb.

986
01:55:52.714 --> 01:55:54.507
Praise the Lord!

987
01:55:59.095 --> 01:56:01.973
Welcome to the fold, brother Plain view.

988
01:56:13.276 --> 01:56:15.612
Welcome, brother Daniel.
God bless you.

989
01:56:16.821 --> 01:56:18.281
God bless you.

990
01:56:21.451 --> 01:56:23.119
- Hallelujah.
- Amen.

991
01:56:23.536 --> 01:56:25.497
Welcome home, brother.

992
01:56:26.122 --> 01:56:29.626
That's enough. That's enough, now.

993
01:56:31.795 --> 01:56:36.007
He must take the spirit in on his own.

994
01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:40.637
We have a new member.

995
01:56:40.762 --> 01:56:42.889
- Yes, brother.
- Hallelujah.

996
01:56:42.972 --> 01:56:44.974
- Hallelujah.
- Amen.

997
01:56:47.143 --> 01:56:49.229
- My sweet Mary.
- Mr. Plain view has been generous

998
01:56:49.312 --> 01:56:52.107
enough to make a $5,000 donation

999
01:56:52.190 --> 01:56:55.276
to the church
which we are still waiting for.

1000
01:58:07.348 --> 01:58:10.685
That does me good.
That does me good.

1001
01:58:12.729 --> 01:58:14.606
Welcome home, son.

1002
01:58:17.233 --> 01:58:19.235
Welcome home, son.

1003
01:58:23.114 --> 01:58:25.259
This here's George Reynolds.
Teacher from the deaf school.

1004
01:58:25.283 --> 01:58:28.328
- Mr. Plain view.
- Fletcher.

1005
01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:33.249
You're too heavy for me.

1006
01:58:36.252 --> 01:58:39.005
Do you want to get something to eat?

1007
01:58:40.173 --> 01:58:44.511
That's the pipeline, see?
All the way to the sea.

1008
01:59:05.573 --> 01:59:07.158
Come here.

1009
01:59:13.998 --> 01:59:15.792
I love you, son.

1010
01:59:17.710 --> 01:59:19.879
Let's take a look at you.

1011
01:59:22.131 --> 01:59:25.009
All right. That's it, that's it. That's it.

1012
01:59:49.033 --> 01:59:52.370
Let's get some decent food
inside of you.

1013
01:59:52.453 --> 01:59:56.291
That's all we need here
is a good, strong, expensive meal.

1014
01:59:56.874 --> 01:59:58.418
You hungry?

1015
01:59:59.460 --> 02:00:00.587
- Waiter?
- Yes, sir.

1016
02:00:00.670 --> 02:00:03.715
Two steaks, a whiskey,
and water for him.

1017
02:00:05.300 --> 02:00:07.844
- And goat's milk.
- Very good, sir.

1018
02:00:14.642 --> 02:00:17.604
We're going to have
this teacher help you.

1019
02:00:18.146 --> 02:00:22.692
He's going to help take care
of all of this. Understand?

1020
02:00:22.775 --> 02:00:25.528
'Cause I need you. Need your help.

1021
02:00:25.612 --> 02:00:29.616
Got everything we need now
to build this company. Come here.

1022
02:00:37.373 --> 02:00:39.125
Good afternoon.

1023
02:00:55.224 --> 02:00:57.310
- How are you doing?
- It's nice to see you again.

1024
02:00:57.393 --> 02:01:00.229
- We need four.
- I'll have them right up.

1025
02:01:04.359 --> 02:01:06.361
- Good afternoon, Daniel.
- Tilford.

1026
02:01:06.444 --> 02:01:07.862
Good afternoon.

1027
02:01:09.405 --> 02:01:14.702
- Hello! H.M. Tilford!
- You don't have to shout.

1028
02:01:16.704 --> 02:01:18.122
Pleasure.

1029
02:01:22.835 --> 02:01:25.129
It's good to be in Little B.

1030
02:01:26.381 --> 02:01:29.717
- Could use some rain out here.
- Yeah, we could.

1031
02:01:30.551 --> 02:01:33.680
- There we go.
- R.J., how's the London broil?

1032
02:01:33.763 --> 02:01:36.474
Believe we ordered these drinks
before those people.

1033
02:01:36.557 --> 02:01:40.853
- R.J., tell us. How's the London broil?
- Excuse me, gentlemen. Sorry.

1034
02:01:42.897 --> 02:01:46.859
I am sorry about that, sir.
I'll have your steaks right out.

1035
02:01:56.661 --> 02:01:59.288
- So that green turtle soup is fantastic.
- Is it?

1036
02:01:59.372 --> 02:02:01.040
It's delicious.

1037
02:02:06.003 --> 02:02:07.004
Sounds good to me.

1038
02:02:07.130 --> 02:02:12.885
So Standard offered us a million
dollars for the Little Boston leases.

1039
02:02:12.969 --> 02:02:15.888
I told H.M. Tilford
where he could shove that.

1040
02:02:15.972 --> 02:02:20.643
And we made a deal with Union!
On the pipeline!

1041
02:02:20.727 --> 02:02:24.230
And that whole ocean of oil
underneath our fields.

1042
02:02:24.313 --> 02:02:25.982
- ...$150,000.
- Yes.

1043
02:02:26.065 --> 02:02:28.401
We needed the money to drill.

1044
02:02:28.484 --> 02:02:30.737
- Who is this guy?
- I go out to meet him.

1045
02:02:30.820 --> 02:02:33.656
He's getting oil on the property.
We're trying to make a claim on it.

1046
02:02:33.740 --> 02:02:35.658
Offered him a million dollars.

1047
02:02:35.783 --> 02:02:38.995
- Turned us down flat.
- Well, I'm hungry.

1048
02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:43.750
Orange fritters,
mashed potatoes, green peas.

1049
02:02:43.833 --> 02:02:46.335
- All the way around?
- All right.

1050
02:02:49.213 --> 02:02:50.631
Hold on.

1051
02:02:54.343 --> 02:02:56.637
I want you to look over there.

1052
02:02:56.721 --> 02:02:59.557
- Daniel, let me introduce...
- Look over there. You see?

1053
02:02:59.682 --> 02:03:01.768
That's my son. See him?

1054
02:03:01.851 --> 02:03:04.187
- Yes.
- Do you see?

1055
02:03:06.522 --> 02:03:07.982
I see him.

1056
02:03:08.816 --> 02:03:11.694
You don't tell me
how to raise my family.

1057
02:03:13.821 --> 02:03:17.408
I told you not to tell me
how to raise my family.

1058
02:03:18.868 --> 02:03:20.745
Daniel...

1059
02:03:21.537 --> 02:03:23.414
So what do you see?

1060
02:03:25.374 --> 02:03:28.586
- I'm very happy for you that the deal...
- Yes, I made a deal with Union.

1061
02:03:28.669 --> 02:03:31.047
- My son is happy. He's safe.
- Congratulations.

1062
02:03:31.130 --> 02:03:34.342
- I'm taking care of him now, so...
- Excellent.

1063
02:03:35.593 --> 02:03:38.638
You look like a fool, don't you, Tilford?

1064
02:03:43.267 --> 02:03:46.145
- Yes.
- Yes.

1065
02:03:47.939 --> 02:03:49.649
Yes, you do.

1066
02:03:50.525 --> 02:03:52.026
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1067
02:03:52.318 --> 02:03:55.571
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Excuse him, gentlemen.

1068
02:03:59.075 --> 02:04:01.744
I told you what I was going to do.

1069
02:04:12.004 --> 02:04:13.256
My son.

1070
02:04:31.315 --> 02:04:34.652
Mr. Sunday, I understand
that you're leaving our fair community.

1071
02:04:34.777 --> 02:04:37.905
- Yes, I'm going on a mission.
- Where you going?

1072
02:04:37.989 --> 02:04:40.199
Oildale, Taft,
and then on to Bakersfield.

1073
02:04:40.283 --> 02:04:42.660
Well, I want you to know...

1074
02:04:42.785 --> 02:04:44.662
Three quarters of an hour.

1075
02:04:44.787 --> 02:04:46.330
...you done a great job for us.

1076
02:04:46.455 --> 02:04:49.333
- Thank you. You will be in my prayers.
- I thank you very much.

1077
02:04:49.417 --> 02:04:52.712
Union Oil Company,
Santa Paula, California.

1078
02:07:01.674 --> 02:07:05.511
"The woman saith unto him,
'Sir, give me this water

1079
02:07:06.512 --> 02:07:11.517
"'and I shall thirst not,
neither come hither to draw."'

1080
02:08:52.993 --> 02:08:54.703
Come in, come in.

1081
02:09:21.397 --> 02:09:23.649
Can we be alone?

1082
02:09:23.732 --> 02:09:27.486
This is my closest associate.
He hears everything.

1083
02:09:34.535 --> 02:09:39.623
- I'd prefer to speak to you in private.
- You can't speak.

1084
02:09:39.707 --> 02:09:41.917
So why don't you flap your hands about

1085
02:09:42.001 --> 02:09:45.588
and have what's-his-name tell me
where you've been.

1086
02:09:53.596 --> 02:09:56.348
Or do you think I don't know?

1087
02:10:10.779 --> 02:10:13.073
This is hard for me to say.

1088
02:10:14.116 --> 02:10:18.287
I'll tell you first, I love you very much.

1089
02:10:21.540 --> 02:10:25.586
I've learned to love what I do
because of you.

1090
02:10:28.964 --> 02:10:30.883
I'm leaving here.

1091
02:10:32.301 --> 02:10:34.637
I'm going to Mexico.

1092
02:10:34.762 --> 02:10:37.765
I'm taking Mary,
and I'm going to Mexico.

1093
02:10:39.391 --> 02:10:41.518
I miss working outside.

1094
02:10:42.519 --> 02:10:44.438
I miss the fields.

1095
02:10:47.358 --> 02:10:49.526
It'll only be for a time,

1096
02:10:50.694 --> 02:10:53.030
for me to do my own drilling

1097
02:10:54.740 --> 02:10:56.909
and start my own company.

1098
02:10:59.870 --> 02:11:04.375
It's time to make a change.

1099
02:11:17.388 --> 02:11:19.932
This makes you my competitor.

1100
02:11:23.852 --> 02:11:29.024
- No. No, it's not like that.
- It is like that, boy.

1101
02:11:30.192 --> 02:11:32.194
Your own company, huh?

1102
02:11:32.611 --> 02:11:34.154
That's right.

1103
02:11:36.448 --> 02:11:38.242
In Mexico?

1104
02:11:39.702 --> 02:11:40.786
Yes.

1105
02:11:40.869 --> 02:11:45.958
You are making such a misstep.
So, what are you doing?

1106
02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:51.338
I know you and I
have disagreed over many things.

1107
02:11:52.214 --> 02:11:56.593
I'd rather keep you as my father
than my partner.

1108
02:11:56.677 --> 02:11:58.178
Then say it.

1109
02:11:58.262 --> 02:12:00.073
If you've got something to say to me,
then say it.

1110
02:12:00.097 --> 02:12:03.767
I'd like to hear you speak
instead of your little dog.

1111
02:12:21.869 --> 02:12:24.580
I'm going to Mexico with my wife.

1112
02:12:25.539 --> 02:12:27.708
I'm going away from you.

1113
02:12:33.714 --> 02:12:36.425
That wasn't so hard, was it?

1114
02:12:38.302 --> 02:12:40.971
Killing us with what you're doing.

1115
02:12:43.849 --> 02:12:47.353
You're killing my image of you
as my son.

1116
02:12:47.436 --> 02:12:50.856
You are stubborn. You won't listen.

1117
02:12:50.939 --> 02:12:53.275
You're not my son.

1118
02:12:53.359 --> 02:12:56.570
Please don't say that.
I know you don't mean it.

1119
02:12:56.653 --> 02:13:00.657
It's the truth. You're not my son.
You never have been.

1120
02:13:01.992 --> 02:13:03.827
You're an orphan!

1121
02:13:06.538 --> 02:13:08.791
Did you ever hear that word?

1122
02:13:10.292 --> 02:13:12.211
Tell him what I said.

1123
02:13:12.961 --> 02:13:15.923
You operated here today like one.

1124
02:13:17.508 --> 02:13:20.010
I should have seen this coming.

1125
02:13:21.470 --> 02:13:26.350
I should have known that,
under this all, these past years

1126
02:13:26.475 --> 02:13:29.853
you've been building new hate for me,
piece by piece.

1127
02:13:29.978 --> 02:13:33.607
I don't even know who you are
because you have none of me in you.

1128
02:13:33.690 --> 02:13:36.610
You're someone else's.

1129
02:13:37.986 --> 02:13:41.490
This anger. Your maliciousness.

1130
02:13:42.574 --> 02:13:45.494
Backwards dealings with me.

1131
02:13:47.162 --> 02:13:51.166
You're an orphan from a basket
in the middle of the desert.

1132
02:13:53.919 --> 02:13:58.924
And I took you for no other reason
than I needed a sweet face to buy land.

1133
02:14:00.384 --> 02:14:02.177
Did you get that?

1134
02:14:03.387 --> 02:14:05.180
So now you know.

1135
02:14:08.475 --> 02:14:12.855
Look at me!
You're lower than a bastard.

1136
02:14:37.713 --> 02:14:42.217
You have none of me in you.
You're just a bastard from a basket.

1137
02:14:51.894 --> 02:14:56.190
I thank God I have none of you in me.

1138
02:15:01.069 --> 02:15:05.574
Not my son.
Just a little piece of competition.

1139
02:15:07.409 --> 02:15:09.578
Bastard from a basket.

1140
02:15:11.914 --> 02:15:14.166
Bastard from a basket!

1141
02:15:22.549 --> 02:15:25.093
You're a bastard from a basket!

1142
02:16:27.614 --> 02:16:29.449
Get up, Mr. Daniel.

1143
02:16:33.787 --> 02:16:35.372
Mr. Daniel.

1144
02:16:37.332 --> 02:16:39.918
Mr. Daniel, you've got a visitor.

1145
02:16:43.547 --> 02:16:45.424
Wake up, Mr. Daniel.

1146
02:16:48.135 --> 02:16:49.720
Sir?

1147
02:17:03.191 --> 02:17:05.193
You can leave us now.

1148
02:17:13.452 --> 02:17:14.453
Daniel.

1149
02:17:17.789 --> 02:17:18.999
Daniel.

1150
02:17:21.543 --> 02:17:24.796
Daniel Plain view, the house is on fire!

1151
02:17:29.426 --> 02:17:32.471
Brother Daniel, it's Eli.

1152
02:17:42.689 --> 02:17:46.443
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

1153
02:17:48.528 --> 02:17:50.489
I'll make us a drink.

1154
02:17:57.037 --> 02:18:00.248
Your home is a miracle.

1155
02:18:01.416 --> 02:18:03.085
It's beautiful.

1156
02:18:03.710 --> 02:18:05.796
God bless it.

1157
02:18:05.921 --> 02:18:09.925
I've been spreading His word
far and wide.

1158
02:18:11.176 --> 02:18:13.011
Far and wide.

1159
02:18:14.763 --> 02:18:17.599
So much travel for Him.

1160
02:18:22.270 --> 02:18:24.690
I've been working in radio.

1161
02:18:27.359 --> 02:18:31.363
Yes, so much...
So much has been happening.

1162
02:18:32.364 --> 02:18:37.911
To be here and find you
and see you well is wonderful.

1163
02:18:37.994 --> 02:18:40.622
And we have a chance to catch up.

1164
02:18:53.719 --> 02:18:55.804
No. Thank you so much.

1165
02:19:13.864 --> 02:19:15.449
My brother.

1166
02:19:16.825 --> 02:19:20.120
Daniel, my brother by marriage.

1167
02:19:22.080 --> 02:19:26.209
We're such old friends. So much time.

1168
02:19:32.674 --> 02:19:35.802
Things go up, things go down,

1169
02:19:35.886 --> 02:19:40.223
but at least the Lord is always around.

1170
02:19:41.808 --> 02:19:44.519
We've seen ups and downs,
haven't we?

1171
02:19:48.315 --> 02:19:51.318
Are things down for you right now, Eli?

1172
02:19:52.652 --> 02:19:54.070
No. No.

1173
02:19:56.490 --> 02:19:59.159
But I do come with some sad news.

1174
02:20:00.869 --> 02:20:03.622
Perhaps you remember Mr. Bandy?

1175
02:20:06.208 --> 02:20:09.586
Mr. Bandy has passed on to the Lord.

1176
02:20:10.504 --> 02:20:13.673
He lived to be 99 years old,
God bless him.

1177
02:20:14.341 --> 02:20:18.220
Mr. Bandy has a grandson.
Have you met his grandson, William?

1178
02:20:19.221 --> 02:20:23.809
William Bandy is one of
the finest members we have

1179
02:20:23.892 --> 02:20:26.478
at the Church of the Third Revelation.

1180
02:20:26.561 --> 02:20:29.898
He's eager to come to Hollywood
to be in movies.

1181
02:20:31.358 --> 02:20:33.568
He is very good-looking.

1182
02:20:35.737 --> 02:20:40.742
- And I do think he will have success.
- That's wonderful.

1183
02:20:42.869 --> 02:20:45.664
Would you like me to speak with him?

1184
02:20:53.088 --> 02:20:57.843
Daniel, I'm asking
if you'd like to have business

1185
02:20:57.926 --> 02:21:00.178
with the Church of the Third Revelation

1186
02:21:00.262 --> 02:21:04.558
in developing this lease
on young Bandy's 1,000-acre tract.

1187
02:21:06.977 --> 02:21:08.603
I'm offering you to drill

1188
02:21:08.728 --> 02:21:12.190
on one of the great undeveloped fields
of Little Boston.

1189
02:21:12.274 --> 02:21:16.444
- I'd be happy to work with you.
- You would?

1190
02:21:17.988 --> 02:21:20.866
Yes, yes, of course. That's wonderful.

1191
02:21:20.949 --> 02:21:23.952
But there is one condition for this work.

1192
02:21:24.035 --> 02:21:25.579
All right.

1193
02:21:27.622 --> 02:21:31.167
I'd like you to tell me
that you are a false prophet.

1194
02:21:36.506 --> 02:21:41.970
I'd like you to tell me that you are,
and have been a false prophet.

1195
02:21:43.138 --> 02:21:45.515
And that God is a superstition.

1196
02:21:51.605 --> 02:21:53.440
But that's a lie.

1197
02:21:56.192 --> 02:21:58.820
It's a lie. I cannot say it.

1198
02:22:13.043 --> 02:22:15.462
- When can we begin to drill?
- Very soon.

1199
02:22:15.545 --> 02:22:17.225
How long will it take
to bring in the well?

1200
02:22:17.297 --> 02:22:19.215
It shouldn't take long.

1201
02:22:19.341 --> 02:22:22.594
I would like a $100,000 signing bonus,

1202
02:22:22.677 --> 02:22:26.014
plus the five that is owed to me
with interest.

1203
02:22:26.681 --> 02:22:28.475
That's only fair.

1204
02:22:34.189 --> 02:22:39.027
I am a false prophet,
and God is a superstition.

1205
02:22:39.110 --> 02:22:42.113
If that's what you believe,
then I will say it.

1206
02:22:42.197 --> 02:22:45.700
- Say it like you mean it.
- Daniel.

1207
02:22:46.201 --> 02:22:48.578
Say it like it's your sermon.

1208
02:22:51.706 --> 02:22:53.375
Don't smile.

1209
02:22:59.130 --> 02:23:01.049
I am a false prophet.

1210
02:23:01.132 --> 02:23:04.552
- God is a superstition.
- Why don't you stand up?

1211
02:23:07.555 --> 02:23:09.599
Put your glass down.

1212
02:23:21.736 --> 02:23:25.323
I am a false prophet.

1213
02:23:25.407 --> 02:23:28.493
- God is a superstition.
- Eli, stop.

1214
02:23:28.576 --> 02:23:34.040
Just imagine this is your church here
and you have a full congregation, so...

1215
02:23:36.543 --> 02:23:40.338
I am a false prophet.
God is a superstition.

1216
02:23:40.422 --> 02:23:42.048
Say it again.

1217
02:23:43.091 --> 02:23:46.970
I am a false prophet.
God is a superstition.

1218
02:23:47.053 --> 02:23:48.280
They can't hear you at the back.

1219
02:23:48.304 --> 02:23:51.725
I am a false prophet.
God is a superstition.

1220
02:23:51.808 --> 02:23:52.892
Say it again.

1221
02:23:52.976 --> 02:23:57.647
I am a false prophet!
God is a superstition!

1222
02:23:57.731 --> 02:23:59.441
Say it again.

1223
02:23:59.524 --> 02:24:03.278
I am a false prophet!
God is a superstition!

1224
02:24:04.446 --> 02:24:06.823
Those areas have been drilled.

1225
02:24:09.951 --> 02:24:11.369
What?

1226
02:24:11.453 --> 02:24:14.122
Those areas, they've been drilled.

1227
02:24:15.665 --> 02:24:19.210
- No, they haven't.
- Yes, it's...

1228
02:24:19.294 --> 02:24:20.670
It's called drainage, Eli.

1229
02:24:20.795 --> 02:24:25.633
See, I own everything around it, so,
of course, I get what's underneath it.

1230
02:24:27.052 --> 02:24:30.263
But there are no derricks there.

1231
02:24:30.346 --> 02:24:32.766
This is the Bandy tract.
Do you understand?

1232
02:24:32.849 --> 02:24:34.851
Do you understand, Eli?

1233
02:24:35.560 --> 02:24:38.813
That's more to the point.
Do you understand?

1234
02:24:38.897 --> 02:24:44.319
I drink your water.
I drink it up every day.

1235
02:24:45.320 --> 02:24:49.574
I drink the blood of Lamb
from Bandy's tract.

1236
02:24:54.829 --> 02:24:56.956
You can sit down again.

1237
02:25:15.058 --> 02:25:16.476
Daniel.

1238
02:25:19.687 --> 02:25:20.730
Daniel.

1239
02:25:24.567 --> 02:25:25.902
Please.

1240
02:25:28.530 --> 02:25:32.867
- I am in desperate times.
- I know.

1241
02:25:32.951 --> 02:25:35.829
- I need a friend.
- Yes. Of course, you do.

1242
02:25:36.204 --> 02:25:37.831
I've sinned.

1243
02:25:39.541 --> 02:25:42.710
I need help. I'm a sinner.

1244
02:25:42.794 --> 02:25:47.423
I've let the devil grab hold of me
in ways I never imagined.

1245
02:25:47.507 --> 02:25:48.967
I'm so full of sin.

1246
02:25:49.050 --> 02:25:52.345
The Lord sometimes challenges us,
doesn't He, Eli?

1247
02:25:52.428 --> 02:25:54.430
- Yes, He does, Daniel.
- Yes, He does.

1248
02:25:54.514 --> 02:25:57.142
Yes, He does!

1249
02:25:57.225 --> 02:25:59.185
Yes, He does!

1250
02:26:00.436 --> 02:26:06.025
He's completely failed to alert me
to the recent panic in our economy.

1251
02:26:06.109 --> 02:26:08.319
- And this...
- Oh, dear.

1252
02:26:08.403 --> 02:26:15.118
I must have this, Daniel.
I must, I must, I must have this.

1253
02:26:15.243 --> 02:26:17.495
My investments have...

1254
02:26:17.579 --> 02:26:22.667
Daniel, I won't bore you, but if I could
grab the Lord's hand for help I would,

1255
02:26:22.750 --> 02:26:25.670
but He does these things all the time.

1256
02:26:25.753 --> 02:26:29.757
These mysteries that He presents,
and while we wait...

1257
02:26:31.009 --> 02:26:33.219
While we wait for His word!

1258
02:26:33.303 --> 02:26:36.306
Because you're not
the chosen brother, Eli.

1259
02:26:38.683 --> 02:26:42.520
'Twas Paul who was chosen.

1260
02:26:43.354 --> 02:26:46.316
He found me and told me
about your land. You're just a fool.

1261
02:26:46.441 --> 02:26:49.277
- Why are you talking about Paul?
- I did what your brother couldn't.

1262
02:26:49.360 --> 02:26:51.946
- Don't say this to me.
- I broke you and I beat you.

1263
02:26:52.780 --> 02:26:55.617
It was Paul told me about you.

1264
02:26:55.742 --> 02:27:00.205
He's the prophet. He's the smart one.
He knew what was there

1265
02:27:00.288 --> 02:27:02.707
and he found me to take it
out of the ground.

1266
02:27:02.790 --> 02:27:05.919
Know what the funny thing is?
Listen, listen.

1267
02:27:06.753 --> 02:27:10.673
I paid him $10,000 cash in hand.
Just like that.

1268
02:27:11.674 --> 02:27:15.053
He has his own company now.
Prosperous little business.

1269
02:27:15.136 --> 02:27:18.681
Three wells producing, $5,000 a week.

1270
02:27:20.725 --> 02:27:24.562
Stop crying, you sniveling ass.
Stop your nonsense.

1271
02:27:25.730 --> 02:27:29.609
- You're just the afterbirth, Eli.
- No.

1272
02:27:29.692 --> 02:27:32.362
That slithered out on your mother's filth.

1273
02:27:32.487 --> 02:27:33.821
No.

1274
02:27:33.905 --> 02:27:38.159
They should've put you in a glass jar
on the mantelpiece.

1275
02:27:39.827 --> 02:27:43.206
Where were you when Paul
was suckling at his mother's teat?

1276
02:27:43.331 --> 02:27:44.832
Where were you?

1277
02:27:44.958 --> 02:27:49.671
Who was nursing you, poor Eli?
One of Bandy's sows?

1278
02:27:49.796 --> 02:27:52.715
That land has been had.
Nothing you can do about it. It's gone.

1279
02:27:52.799 --> 02:27:55.009
- If you would just take this lease...
- You lose.

1280
02:27:55.093 --> 02:27:58.346
Drainage!

1281
02:27:59.347 --> 02:28:02.976
Drainage, Eli, you boy.

1282
02:28:04.060 --> 02:28:07.021
Drained dry. I'm so sorry.

1283
02:28:08.189 --> 02:28:10.358
If you have a milkshake

1284
02:28:11.401 --> 02:28:13.194
and I have a milkshake,

1285
02:28:13.278 --> 02:28:16.489
and I have a straw, there it is.
That's the straw, you see?

1286
02:28:16.572 --> 02:28:18.199
Watch it.

1287
02:28:19.575 --> 02:28:26.541
Now my straw reaches across the room

1288
02:28:27.792 --> 02:28:30.628
and starts to drink your milkshake.

1289
02:28:31.546 --> 02:28:35.383
I drink your milkshake!

1290
02:28:37.552 --> 02:28:41.055
- I drink it up!
- Don't bully me, Daniel.

1291
02:28:43.725 --> 02:28:48.980
Did you think your song and dance and
your superstition would help you, Eli?

1292
02:28:49.063 --> 02:28:53.735
I am the Third Revelation.
I am who the Lord has chosen.

1293
02:28:55.903 --> 02:28:58.239
- Daniel!
- Because I'm smarter than you!

1294
02:28:58.323 --> 02:28:59.824
I'm older!

1295
02:29:00.616 --> 02:29:02.452
I'm your old friend, Daniel!

1296
02:29:02.535 --> 02:29:04.996
- I'm not a false prophet...
- Help me! Help me!

1297
02:29:05.079 --> 02:29:07.332
...you sniveling boy!

1298
02:29:07.415 --> 02:29:14.130
I am the Third Revelation!
I am the Third Revelation!

1299
02:29:14.213 --> 02:29:17.216
- I told you I would eat you.
- We're family!

1300
02:29:17.300 --> 02:29:21.763
- I told you I would eat you up!
- We're brothers! We're brothers!

1301
02:29:28.853 --> 02:29:31.689
Daniel, please forgive me. I beg you.

1302
02:29:35.318 --> 02:29:37.445
That's it. That's it.

1303
02:30:39.799 --> 02:30:41.300
Mr. Daniel?

1304
02:30:49.183 --> 02:30:50.893
I'm finished.
