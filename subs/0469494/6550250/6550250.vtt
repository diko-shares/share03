1
00:05:12.271 --> 00:05:13.398
No!

2
00:05:46.973 --> 00:05:49.308
There she is. There she is.

3
00:05:58.568 --> 00:06:00.153
There she is.

4
00:14:48.764 --> 00:14:50.808
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

5
00:14:50.891 --> 00:14:55.062
<i>I've traveled over half our state
to be here tonight.</i>

6
00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:57.690
<i>I couldn't get away sooner
because my new well was coming in</i>

7
00:14:57.773 --> 00:15:00.693
<i>at Coyote Hills
and I had to see about it.</i>

8
00:15:00.776 --> 00:15:03.821
<i>That well is now flowing
at 2,000 barrels</i>

9
00:15:03.904 --> 00:15:07.116
<i>and it's paying me an income
of $5,000 a week.</i>

10
00:15:07.741 --> 00:15:11.078
I have two others drilling
and I have 16 producing at Antelope,

11
00:15:11.203 --> 00:15:15.624
so, ladies and gentlemen,
if I say I'm an oilman, you will agree.

12
00:15:18.419 --> 00:15:21.130
Now, you have a great chance here,

13
00:15:21.213 --> 00:15:24.133
but bear in mind you could lose it all
if you're not careful.

14
00:15:24.216 --> 00:15:26.635
Out of all men that beg for a chance
to drill your lots,

15
00:15:26.719 --> 00:15:29.972
maybe one in twenty will be oilmen.

16
00:15:30.055 --> 00:15:31.307
The rest will be speculators,

17
00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:33.934
that's men trying to get between
you and the oilmen

18
00:15:34.018 --> 00:15:37.646
to get some of the money that ought,
by rights, come to you.

19
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:40.691
Even if you find one that has money
and means to drill,

20
00:15:40.774 --> 00:15:43.235
he'll maybe know nothing about drilling.

21
00:15:43.319 --> 00:15:45.321
He'll have to hire the job out
on contract,

22
00:15:45.404 --> 00:15:48.240
and then you're depending
on a contractor,

23
00:15:48.324 --> 00:15:49.408
who'll rush the job through

24
00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:51.618
so he can get another contract
just as quick as he can.

25
00:15:51.702 --> 00:15:53.287
This is the way that this works.

26
00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:56.665
What is your offer? We're wasting time.

27
00:15:56.915 --> 00:15:57.916
Please!

28
00:16:01.128 --> 00:16:03.088
I do my own drilling.

29
00:16:03.756 --> 00:16:07.634
And the men that work for me,
work for me, and they are men I know.

30
00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:11.472
I make it my business to be there
and to see their work.

31
00:16:11.597 --> 00:16:14.683
I don't lose my tools in the hole
and spend months fishing for them.

32
00:16:14.767 --> 00:16:15.934
I don't botch the cementing off

33
00:16:16.018 --> 00:16:19.605
and let water in the hole
and ruin the whole lease.

34
00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:21.732
I'm a family man.

35
00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:26.487
I run a family business. This is my son
and my partner, H.W. Plainview.

36
00:16:27.446 --> 00:16:32.284
We offer you the bond of family
that very few oilmen can understand.

37
00:16:34.244 --> 00:16:37.331
I'm fixed like no other company
in this field

38
00:16:37.456 --> 00:16:40.626
and that's because
my Coyote Hills well has just come in.

39
00:16:40.751 --> 00:16:43.212
I have a string of tools
all ready to put to work.

40
00:16:43.295 --> 00:16:45.464
I can load a rig onto trucks
and have them here in a week.

41
00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:48.634
I have business connections,
so I can get the lumber for the derricks.

42
00:16:48.759 --> 00:16:52.554
Such things go by friendship
in a rush like this.

43
00:16:52.638 --> 00:16:56.517
And this is why I can guarantee
to start drilling

44
00:16:56.642 --> 00:16:59.561
and to put up the cash to back my word.

45
00:16:59.645 --> 00:17:01.230
I assure you, ladies and gentlemen,

46
00:17:01.313 --> 00:17:04.650
no matter what the others
promise to do,

47
00:17:04.775 --> 00:17:08.195
when it comes to the showdown,
they won't be there.

48
00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:12.449
Sit down! Sit down, you have no right...

49
00:17:13.283 --> 00:17:15.452
Let us discuss what the man has to say.

50
00:17:15.536 --> 00:17:18.580
- Prescott, do you trust this man?
- Let's discuss what he has to say.

51
00:17:18.664 --> 00:17:22.167
- There's logic to what he's saying.
- How does he know? My lot is there!

52
00:17:23.961 --> 00:17:27.089
Two or three years,
it could be ten years!

53
00:17:27.172 --> 00:17:30.342
- We gain nothing by losing our heads!
- Look at that well out there!

54
00:17:30.426 --> 00:17:32.010
Nobody's losing their heads.

55
00:17:32.928 --> 00:17:35.514
You have no business being here!

56
00:17:36.473 --> 00:17:38.976
Sit that woman down, sir!

57
00:17:40.602 --> 00:17:42.020
You can sit down.

58
00:17:42.104 --> 00:17:44.606
Mr. Plainview! Please, Mr. Plainview.

59
00:17:45.691 --> 00:17:47.693
No, Mr. Plainview!
No, where are you going?

60
00:17:47.776 --> 00:17:50.904
- I don't need the lease. Thank you.
- But we need you.

61
00:17:50.988 --> 00:17:53.240
Too much confusion.
Thank you for your time.

62
00:17:53.323 --> 00:17:55.033
No, no, there's no confusion.

63
00:17:55.117 --> 00:17:58.829
I wouldn't take the lease
if you gave it to me as a gift.

64
00:18:09.465 --> 00:18:12.259
<i>Mr. Bankside,
I'm not going to waste your time.</i>

65
00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:14.803
<i>I'd certainly appreciate it
if you didn't waste mine.</i>

66
00:18:14.887 --> 00:18:19.641
Now, if you wish to sign with me, we
can have a well drilling within 10 days.

67
00:18:19.725 --> 00:18:23.187
Your lot is further north
from the discovery well up here.

68
00:18:23.312 --> 00:18:25.898
That means
we'll probably have to dig deeper.

69
00:18:25.981 --> 00:18:28.400
And if there's as much oil here
as I think there is,

70
00:18:28.484 --> 00:18:31.487
it'll be harder to reach, but once
we find it, we can take it right out.

71
00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:36.241
We have to act quickly, because
very soon these fields will be dry.

72
00:18:36.325 --> 00:18:38.660
I need you to know what you want to do.

73
00:18:38.744 --> 00:18:41.788
Now, because of the distance
from the discovery well,

74
00:18:41.872 --> 00:18:44.166
I'll pay you a smaller royalty
than you'd get down there

75
00:18:44.249 --> 00:18:48.086
but I'm prepared to give you
a $1,000 bonus on your lot.

76
00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:49.755
What kind of royalty
are you talking about?

77
00:18:49.838 --> 00:18:54.301
One-sixth, plus a guarantee
to start drilling within 10 days.

78
00:18:54.384 --> 00:18:57.638
Now, that's something
you won't find anywhere else.

79
00:19:06.522 --> 00:19:08.524
What age are your children, ma'am?

80
00:19:08.607 --> 00:19:10.359
Ten and twelve.

81
00:19:11.443 --> 00:19:15.364
Mr. Plainview, a question, sir.
Where is your wife?

82
00:19:17.449 --> 00:19:20.327
She died in childbirth, Mrs. Bankside.

83
00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:23.747
So it's just me and my son now.

84
00:19:30.587 --> 00:19:32.464
It's coming in, boss!

85
00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:34.216
Hear it?

86
00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:02.202
Mr. Plainview?

87
00:20:02.286 --> 00:20:03.537
Yes?

88
00:20:05.747 --> 00:20:07.874
Are you Daniel Plainview?

89
00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:10.919
Yes.

90
00:20:12.546 --> 00:20:14.548
What can I do for you?

91
00:20:16.341 --> 00:20:18.176
You look for oil.

92
00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:20.887
That's right.

93
00:20:21.013 --> 00:20:24.057
What do you pay for a place that has it?

94
00:20:24.182 --> 00:20:27.185
- Well, that depends.
- What does it depend on?

95
00:20:29.187 --> 00:20:31.064
On a lot of things.

96
00:20:31.982 --> 00:20:36.987
If I told you I knew a place that had oil
where land could be bought cheaply,

97
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.865
what do you think that would be worth?

98
00:20:40.866 --> 00:20:45.120
I think that you should let me know
what you know

99
00:20:45.203 --> 00:20:48.373
and then we'll try
and work something out.

100
00:20:50.375 --> 00:20:52.544
- Can I sit down?
- Please.

101
00:21:03.639 --> 00:21:05.974
What church do you belong to?

102
00:21:11.647 --> 00:21:12.981
I...

103
00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:18.654
I enjoy all faiths. I don't belong
to one church in particular.

104
00:21:18.737 --> 00:21:22.783
I like them all. I like everything.
Where are you from?

105
00:21:22.866 --> 00:21:26.745
That would be telling you.
That's what I want to sell you.

106
00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:31.875
What are you doing in Signal Hill?

107
00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:34.378
We have oil,
and it seeps through the ground.

108
00:21:34.461 --> 00:21:36.046
Do you want to pay me
to know where it is?

109
00:21:36.129 --> 00:21:37.214
Just 'cause there's something
on the ground

110
00:21:37.297 --> 00:21:39.091
doesn't mean
there's anything beneath it.

111
00:21:39.174 --> 00:21:41.927
Why did Standard Oil buy up land?

112
00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:46.390
Is it in California?

113
00:21:47.265 --> 00:21:50.435
- Maybe.
- How much land did they buy?

114
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.980
I'd like it better
if you didn't think I was stupid.

115
00:22:02.406 --> 00:22:04.783
Why did you come to me?

116
00:22:04.866 --> 00:22:09.204
- You just brought this well in.
- That's right.

117
00:22:09.287 --> 00:22:13.625
Yes, so just give me $500 in cash
right now

118
00:22:13.709 --> 00:22:16.169
and I'll tell you where it is.

119
00:22:16.253 --> 00:22:18.547
I'll tell you what I'll do, son.
I'll give you $100 now,

120
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:23.301
and if it proves to be a promising lease,
then give you a $1,000 bonus.

121
00:22:23.385 --> 00:22:25.345
Six hundred dollars.

122
00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:31.059
Tell me one thing to help me decide.
What else have you got up there?

123
00:22:31.143 --> 00:22:32.853
What do you grow?

124
00:22:32.936 --> 00:22:36.690
We have a big ranch,
but it's mostly rocks.

125
00:22:36.773 --> 00:22:39.276
Plant things.
Nothing will grow but weeds.

126
00:22:39.359 --> 00:22:40.610
What makes you think it's up?

127
00:22:40.694 --> 00:22:43.822
Is there sulfur around?
Or alkali deposits?

128
00:22:43.905 --> 00:22:46.992
Alkali nearby. I don't know sulfur.

129
00:22:53.498 --> 00:22:55.333
Is that your son?

130
00:22:55.751 --> 00:22:57.085
Yes.

131
00:22:58.378 --> 00:22:59.671
- Hi.
- Hi.

132
00:23:02.841 --> 00:23:05.719
- Who are you?
- I'm Fletcher Hamilton.

133
00:23:05.844 --> 00:23:07.804
Nice to meet you, son.
What's your name?

134
00:23:07.888 --> 00:23:09.556
What do you do?

135
00:23:10.515 --> 00:23:12.684
I work with Mr. Plainview.

136
00:23:13.351 --> 00:23:15.103
Here's $500, son.

137
00:23:15.187 --> 00:23:19.065
You tell me something worth hearing,
this money's yours.

138
00:23:23.028 --> 00:23:26.907
I come from a town called Little Boston
in Isabella County.

139
00:23:29.034 --> 00:23:33.497
This is us, here.
Spur station here at Little Boston.

140
00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:36.625
The Sunday ranch
is what you're looking for.

141
00:23:36.708 --> 00:23:38.960
There's a sheep trail
that takes you there.

142
00:23:39.044 --> 00:23:42.047
It's a mile out of town headed west,
not far.

143
00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:46.051
Just through a small pass here
near the base of the hills.

144
00:23:46.176 --> 00:23:49.888
You'll pass a church
and just follow the sheep trail.

145
00:23:50.013 --> 00:23:54.184
- Where's Standard buying up?
- Here and here.

146
00:23:56.311 --> 00:23:58.772
- Your family name is Sunday, yes?
- That's right.

147
00:23:58.855 --> 00:24:00.357
How many's in your family?

148
00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.693
My father and mother and sisters
and my brother Eli.

149
00:24:03.777 --> 00:24:06.488
- How many sisters do you have?
- Two.

150
00:24:06.571 --> 00:24:08.907
- What's your name?
- Paul.

151
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:12.244
Does any of your family know
about the oil that you say is there?

152
00:24:12.327 --> 00:24:13.787
I don't know.

153
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:16.540
My uncle always said
there was oil there,

154
00:24:16.623 --> 00:24:19.125
but I don't know what they heard
or what they think.

155
00:24:19.209 --> 00:24:20.669
What do you grow?

156
00:24:20.752 --> 00:24:25.924
It's goats. It's a goat farm.
I told you, nothing grows but weeds.

157
00:24:26.007 --> 00:24:28.552
- Is there water?
- It's salty.

158
00:24:28.635 --> 00:24:32.055
You drill a well,
it's hard not to get saltwater.

159
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:37.310
The oil is there. I'm telling you.

160
00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:45.151
- I want to go now, so...
- You can stay tonight.

161
00:24:45.277 --> 00:24:49.364
- No, I want to go now. I want to leave.
- Listen, Paul.

162
00:24:51.199 --> 00:24:55.996
If I travel all the way out there
and I find that you've been lying to me,

163
00:24:56.121 --> 00:24:58.707
I'm going to find you and I'm going
to take more than my money back.

164
00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:01.042
Is that all right with you?

165
00:25:01.126 --> 00:25:03.420
- Yes, sir.
- All right, then.

166
00:25:04.129 --> 00:25:08.300
- Nice luck to you. God bless.
- And to you, young man.

167
00:26:47.691 --> 00:26:49.734
- There's someone coming.
- Thank you, Mary.

168
00:26:59.411 --> 00:27:02.998
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

169
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.795
My name's Daniel Plainview.
This is my son, H.W.

170
00:27:09.629 --> 00:27:12.424
- Are you hunting?
- Hunting for quail.

171
00:27:12.507 --> 00:27:15.385
We're told there might be a good place
to camp up near the Sunday ranch.

172
00:27:15.468 --> 00:27:17.345
This is the Sunday ranch.
You can camp here.

173
00:27:17.429 --> 00:27:20.181
- Thank you. Do you have water?
- Yes.

174
00:27:21.141 --> 00:27:23.184
We heard there was an earthquake
up here a few days ago.

175
00:27:23.268 --> 00:27:25.145
- Is that right?
- Yes.

176
00:27:25.979 --> 00:27:29.691
- Your family?
- Yeah, all fine. Thank you.

177
00:27:31.276 --> 00:27:34.779
- We have goat's milk, if you'd like.
- That would be fine.

178
00:27:36.781 --> 00:27:37.782
Now,

179
00:27:39.617 --> 00:27:43.705
if we set our tent away over there,
we'd be out of your way over there.

180
00:27:43.788 --> 00:27:45.081
That's fine.

181
00:27:45.165 --> 00:27:47.375
Ruth! Help these men
and bring them some water.

182
00:27:47.459 --> 00:27:48.960
No! H.W.

183
00:27:50.795 --> 00:27:54.299
Mr. Plainview,
would you like that milk now?

184
00:27:54.424 --> 00:27:58.511
- That would be fine. Thank you.
- Mary! Bring them some milk.

185
00:27:58.636 --> 00:28:00.055
My family will help you set up your tent.

186
00:28:00.138 --> 00:28:02.390
No, please.
We set ourselves on this camping trip.

187
00:28:02.474 --> 00:28:04.184
We have to do the camping.

188
00:28:04.309 --> 00:28:05.685
Hurry up!

189
00:28:08.646 --> 00:28:12.650
- Do you have bread?
- We have potatoes.

190
00:28:12.776 --> 00:28:14.402
Potatoes would be nice, thank you.

191
00:28:14.486 --> 00:28:15.987
I'll have them boil you up
some potatoes.

192
00:28:16.112 --> 00:28:18.406
That's all right.
I thought maybe we'd make a fire.

193
00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:20.742
I wanted to work with my son
on making a fire.

194
00:28:20.825 --> 00:28:22.827
All right. My son, Eli, will bring you
some wood.

195
00:28:22.911 --> 00:28:24.996
Thank you so much for your hospitality,
Mr. Sunday.

196
00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.123
- Yes.
- And we'll be out of your way.

197
00:28:27.207 --> 00:28:30.001
- We're just hunting for quail.
- Yes.

198
00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.089
- I'm sorry we don't have any bread.
- No, no, no.

199
00:28:34.172 --> 00:28:37.008
Corn doesn't fill out in the hills here.
It's mostly rock.

200
00:28:37.133 --> 00:28:39.969
We don't have room to raise the grain.

201
00:28:43.681 --> 00:28:45.767
Thank you, young lady.

202
00:29:10.959 --> 00:29:12.627
My name is Eli.

203
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.922
Yes, you're Eli Sunday.

204
00:29:16.881 --> 00:29:18.341
Welcome.

205
00:29:22.011 --> 00:29:23.721
- H.W.
- Eli.

206
00:29:29.018 --> 00:29:32.147
- You're hunting quail?
- That's right.

207
00:29:36.401 --> 00:29:40.905
- We will bring dinner.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

208
00:31:02.987 --> 00:31:04.197
Dad!

209
00:31:04.864 --> 00:31:06.658
Dad, look at my shoe.

210
00:31:33.101 --> 00:31:35.770
That's earthquake oil. Set loose.

211
00:31:59.252 --> 00:32:00.586
<i>So...</i>

212
00:32:02.171 --> 00:32:03.381
<i>So?</i>

213
00:32:04.215 --> 00:32:05.633
<i>So, so.</i>

214
00:32:06.384 --> 00:32:09.721
<i>If there's anything here,
we take it to the sea.</i>

215
00:32:10.847 --> 00:32:14.600
What we do is we build a pipeline
to Port Hueneme or Santa Paula,

216
00:32:14.684 --> 00:32:16.227
it's about 100 miles,

217
00:32:16.311 --> 00:32:20.231
and we do a deal with Union Oil.
This is what we do.

218
00:32:20.732 --> 00:32:23.735
Then we don't need the railroads
and their shipping costs anymore.

219
00:32:23.818 --> 00:32:25.236
You see?

220
00:32:28.072 --> 00:32:29.115
Yeah.

221
00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:31.909
- You see that?
- Yeah.

222
00:32:32.952 --> 00:32:35.204
Then we're making money.
We're making the real money.

223
00:32:35.288 --> 00:32:37.165
What we should be making.
Not just...

224
00:32:37.248 --> 00:32:39.667
Not just throwing it away
on shipping costs.

225
00:32:39.751 --> 00:32:41.919
Otherwise, it's just mud.

226
00:32:46.132 --> 00:32:48.760
How much are we going to pay them?

227
00:32:49.594 --> 00:32:51.095
Who's that?

228
00:32:53.765 --> 00:32:55.600
The Sunday family.

229
00:32:56.142 --> 00:32:59.062
I'm not going to give them oil prices.

230
00:33:01.606 --> 00:33:03.900
I'll give them quail prices.

231
00:33:09.614 --> 00:33:11.240
If we could take a few minutes,

232
00:33:11.324 --> 00:33:14.494
there's something I'd very much
like to talk with you about.

233
00:33:14.619 --> 00:33:17.955
Mother, would you take the girls
outside, please?

234
00:33:30.134 --> 00:33:32.970
I believe in plain speaking, so...

235
00:33:33.054 --> 00:33:36.766
This is a beautiful ranch.
I love hunting for quail.

236
00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.686
My boy has been sick, you know.
He needs fresh air.

237
00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:44.023
Doctors all say
he needs plentiful fresh air.

238
00:33:45.817 --> 00:33:46.818
So,

239
00:33:49.404 --> 00:33:53.408
what would you say would be
a fair price for this lot, Abel?

240
00:33:54.492 --> 00:33:57.120
- To buy this place?
- That's right.

241
00:34:02.083 --> 00:34:03.918
Take a moment.

242
00:34:07.755 --> 00:34:11.509
- I'm sorry. I don't know.
- Six dollars an acre.

243
00:34:11.592 --> 00:34:15.054
Six dollars? Thank you, Eli.

244
00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:18.891
And then with the improvements
to the ranch over the years at $500...

245
00:34:19.016 --> 00:34:21.561
I'd like to offer you $3,700
for this ranch.

246
00:34:21.686 --> 00:34:24.272
- That's $3,700.
- No.

247
00:34:25.189 --> 00:34:27.483
The Lord has sent this man here, Eli.

248
00:34:27.567 --> 00:34:29.110
Yes, I believe He has.

249
00:34:29.193 --> 00:34:33.322
- My offer to you is $3,700.
- What is it that brought you here, sir?

250
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:36.159
The Good Lord's guidance.

251
00:34:36.242 --> 00:34:37.618
- Now, of course, within that...
- What about our oil?

252
00:34:37.702 --> 00:34:39.370
...we're going to develop a lease.

253
00:34:40.663 --> 00:34:44.208
- What's that?
- What about our oil?

254
00:34:45.543 --> 00:34:47.003
What about it?

255
00:34:47.086 --> 00:34:49.297
We have oil here.
That's worth something.

256
00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.841
Do you have someone
who can drill for it?

257
00:34:51.924 --> 00:34:53.885
- Do you think there's oil here?
- I know there is.

258
00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:56.053
It's very expensive to drill.

259
00:34:56.179 --> 00:34:58.347
To get it up and out of the ground.
You ever tried that before?

260
00:34:58.431 --> 00:35:00.516
- How much is it?
- Costly.

261
00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.728
Well, our oil sits right up
on top of the ground.

262
00:35:04.729 --> 00:35:06.481
I believe that's called seepage.

263
00:35:06.564 --> 00:35:08.107
Doesn't necessarily mean
there's anything underneath.

264
00:35:08.232 --> 00:35:10.401
- What would you give us for it?
- I don't know.

265
00:35:10.485 --> 00:35:13.446
- Something you don't know.
- That's right.

266
00:35:16.741 --> 00:35:18.743
What would you like, Eli?

267
00:35:20.411 --> 00:35:22.747
Ten thousand dollars.

268
00:35:24.916 --> 00:35:26.417
For what?

269
00:35:28.377 --> 00:35:30.087
For my church.

270
00:35:40.014 --> 00:35:41.557
That's good.

271
00:35:44.519 --> 00:35:46.354
That's a good one.

272
00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:48.981
Well...

273
00:35:50.233 --> 00:35:53.861
If we decide to drill for oil
and if the well begins to produce,

274
00:35:53.945 --> 00:35:55.655
I'll give your church
a $5,000 signing bonus.

275
00:35:55.738 --> 00:35:56.697
Ten thousand.

276
00:35:56.781 --> 00:35:59.325
Do you want to find someone else
that's going to come here and drill, Eli?

277
00:35:59.408 --> 00:36:02.537
Make the investment and do
all the hard work that goes into it?

278
00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:06.541
I can just as easily hunt for quail
on another ranch as I can here, so...

279
00:36:06.624 --> 00:36:11.295
Though I'll happily be a supporter
of your church for as long as I can.

280
00:36:11.379 --> 00:36:13.214
For the bonus only.

281
00:36:14.966 --> 00:36:18.803
Now, as it happens, I do have some
connections in the drilling business

282
00:36:18.886 --> 00:36:23.474
who might help get us started.
How do you feel about this, Abel?

283
00:36:23.558 --> 00:36:25.476
Yes. What Eli says.

284
00:36:25.601 --> 00:36:28.771
Well, good! Let's draw up
some contracts and let's...

285
00:36:28.854 --> 00:36:30.815
Let's give it a try.

286
00:36:32.149 --> 00:36:34.986
Appreciate your help with this, Eli.

287
00:36:46.289 --> 00:36:47.915
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

288
00:36:47.999 --> 00:36:49.333
- Real estate?
- Yes.

289
00:36:49.458 --> 00:36:51.502
Yes, I'd like to talk to you.

290
00:36:51.586 --> 00:36:56.132
I'm looking for some land.
I just bought the Sunday ranch.

291
00:36:56.215 --> 00:37:00.303
And, well, where's the map?

292
00:37:00.845 --> 00:37:03.306
Where are the hills
behind the Sunday ranch?

293
00:37:03.389 --> 00:37:07.101
That's here. It's the Bandy tract.
He has over 600 acres.

294
00:37:07.184 --> 00:37:11.272
Bandy, 600.

295
00:37:11.355 --> 00:37:17.862
- What about this?
- A.C. Maude, Blodget, Redlick, Carr.

296
00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:22.575
- What's it held at?
- Six dollars an acre.

297
00:37:23.284 --> 00:37:24.619
Six.

298
00:37:24.702 --> 00:37:26.370
What about this?

299
00:37:26.454 --> 00:37:30.082
That's the Belvins,
and that could be got, I'm sure.

300
00:37:31.959 --> 00:37:34.712
Can everything around here be got?

301
00:37:35.421 --> 00:37:36.922
Sure.

302
00:38:01.238 --> 00:38:04.742
Paul Sunday turned out
to be a good friend of ours.

303
00:38:05.409 --> 00:38:07.036
That's right.

304
00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:13.376
Well, you get here just as soon
as you can. Bring Fred English.

305
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:16.170
Good enough.

306
00:38:16.796 --> 00:38:18.589
Thank you, porter.

307
00:38:21.133 --> 00:38:23.803
- H.W., how are you?
- Fine, and you?

308
00:38:23.886 --> 00:38:25.596
- Pretty good. Where's your dad?
- He's inside.

309
00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.306
You fellas are a long way
from Signal Hill.

310
00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:29.392
- Hello, Plainview.
- Hello, Gene.

311
00:38:29.475 --> 00:38:32.019
- Good to see you.
- Charlie.

312
00:38:32.103 --> 00:38:36.691
- On your way somewhere else?
- Passing through. Looking around.

313
00:38:36.774 --> 00:38:39.318
- Funny to see you.
- Funny, isn't it?

314
00:38:39.443 --> 00:38:42.196
You boys are a regular family business.

315
00:38:42.279 --> 00:38:43.989
You boys are a little late.

316
00:38:44.115 --> 00:38:48.160
- What did you find?
- I found some interesting prospects.

317
00:38:48.285 --> 00:38:49.537
Did you hear Standard bought up?

318
00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:52.248
- Mostly in the north, so far.
- That's what I hear.

319
00:38:52.331 --> 00:38:55.793
I'm gonna tell you, Gene,
if you're gonna make a play, look east.

320
00:38:55.918 --> 00:39:01.173
I'd rather it be you than someone else.
This mud around here has been taken.

321
00:39:01.298 --> 00:39:04.844
It must be easy when you have such
a cute face to carry around with you.

322
00:39:04.969 --> 00:39:08.055
- Telling me how handsome my son is?
- Well, that I am.

323
00:39:08.139 --> 00:39:11.308
That's very nice. Thank you.
Good luck, Gene.

324
00:39:11.434 --> 00:39:13.894
- Take care.
- Like I said, go east.

325
00:39:13.978 --> 00:39:15.146
H.W.

326
00:39:16.147 --> 00:39:18.816
I'll be your lawyer
if you need to draw up a contract.

327
00:39:18.941 --> 00:39:23.237
Make sure you don't get swindled, boy.
Get half what your dad's making.

328
00:39:33.497 --> 00:39:35.124
How's that?

329
00:39:50.014 --> 00:39:52.224
What are those men doing?

330
00:39:54.518 --> 00:39:57.104
They're just guys
that are working for us.

331
00:39:57.188 --> 00:39:59.523
They're just looking around.

332
00:40:01.692 --> 00:40:03.986
How much money can we make?

333
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:10.367
I don't know. It depends.

334
00:40:14.538 --> 00:40:16.707
One thousand dollars?

335
00:40:24.507 --> 00:40:28.302
Mary said that her father beats her
if she doesn't pray.

336
00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:37.311
Mary, she's the smaller one?

337
00:40:39.939 --> 00:40:41.524
Yes, she is.

338
00:40:55.246 --> 00:40:57.832
- Everyone here?
- Very successful.

339
00:40:58.582 --> 00:40:59.625
But?

340
00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:03.128
There were a few vacant lots
and one holdout.

341
00:41:03.254 --> 00:41:04.880
- Who?
- William Bandy.

342
00:41:04.964 --> 00:41:07.049
...eight. Who's he?

343
00:41:07.132 --> 00:41:08.551
He's an old man
who homesteaded here.

344
00:41:08.634 --> 00:41:11.804
Lives with his grandson.
He said he'd like to speak with you.

345
00:41:11.929 --> 00:41:13.097
Is he here?

346
00:41:13.222 --> 00:41:16.267
No, he'd like you to come visit with him.

347
00:41:16.392 --> 00:41:18.102
He's boosting his price.

348
00:41:18.227 --> 00:41:22.022
He said he'd like to speak
with whoever is doing the buying.

349
00:41:22.106 --> 00:41:25.442
Well, let him wait. He'll come around.
Let's go.

350
00:41:32.449 --> 00:41:34.451
Ladies and gentlemen?

351
00:41:35.411 --> 00:41:37.454
Ladies and gentlemen.

352
00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:40.958
Thank you so much
for visiting with us this evening.

353
00:41:41.083 --> 00:41:44.670
Now, I've traveled across half our state
to be here and to see about this land.

354
00:41:47.715 --> 00:41:49.258
<i>Now, I daresay some of you
might have heard</i>

355
00:41:49.341 --> 00:41:53.220
<i>some of the more extravagant rumors
about what my plans are,</i>

356
00:41:53.304 --> 00:41:56.098
<i>so I just thought
you'd like to hear it from me.</i>

357
00:41:56.181 --> 00:41:59.101
<i>This is the face. It's no great mystery.</i>

358
00:42:01.937 --> 00:42:05.941
<i>I'm an oilman, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

359
00:42:06.775 --> 00:42:10.195
<i>I have numerous concerns
spread across this state.</i>

360
00:42:10.279 --> 00:42:13.699
<i>I have many wells flowing
at many thousand barrels per day,</i>

361
00:42:13.782 --> 00:42:16.785
<i>so I like to think of myself as an oilman.</i>

362
00:42:17.745 --> 00:42:19.580
<i>As an oilman, I hope that you'll forgive</i>

363
00:42:19.663 --> 00:42:22.583
<i>just good old-fashioned plain speaking.</i>

364
00:42:24.168 --> 00:42:27.755
<i>Now, this work that we do
is very much a family enterprise.</i>

365
00:42:27.838 --> 00:42:30.549
<i>I work side by side
with my wonderful son, H. W.</i>

366
00:42:30.633 --> 00:42:33.886
<i>I think one or two of you
might have met him already.</i>

367
00:42:33.969 --> 00:42:37.765
<i>And I encourage my men
to bring their families, as well.</i>

368
00:42:37.848 --> 00:42:41.852
<i>Of course, it makes for an ever
so much more rewarding life for them.</i>

369
00:42:41.936 --> 00:42:45.940
<i>Family means children,
and children means education.</i>

370
00:42:46.023 --> 00:42:49.735
<i>So, wherever we set up camp,
education is a necessity,</i>

371
00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:52.071
<i>and we're just so happy
to take care of that.</i>

372
00:42:52.196 --> 00:42:54.573
So let's build a wonderful school
in Little Boston.

373
00:42:54.698 --> 00:42:56.909
These children are the future
that we strive for,

374
00:42:57.034 --> 00:43:00.120
and so they should have
the very best of things.

375
00:43:00.204 --> 00:43:02.247
Now, something else,

376
00:43:02.373 --> 00:43:06.210
and please don't be insulted
if I speak about this. Bread.

377
00:43:06.335 --> 00:43:08.337
Let's talk about bread.

378
00:43:09.004 --> 00:43:12.383
Now, to my mind, it's an abomination
to consider

379
00:43:12.466 --> 00:43:16.720
that any man, woman, or child
in this magnificent country of ours

380
00:43:16.804 --> 00:43:20.307
should have to look upon
a loaf of bread as a luxury.

381
00:43:21.058 --> 00:43:24.687
<i>We're going to dig water wells here,
and water wells means irrigation.</i>

382
00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:27.189
<i>Irrigation means cultivation.</i>

383
00:43:27.272 --> 00:43:31.193
<i>We're going to raise crops here where
before it just simply wasn't possible.</i>

384
00:43:31.276 --> 00:43:33.737
<i>You're going to have more grain
than you'll know what to do with,</i>

385
00:43:33.821 --> 00:43:36.782
<i>and bread will be coming right
out of your ears, ma'am.</i>

386
00:43:36.865 --> 00:43:42.204
<i>New roads, agriculture,
employment, education.</i>

387
00:43:42.287 --> 00:43:44.289
These are just a few of the things
we can offer you,

388
00:43:44.373 --> 00:43:46.375
and I assure you,
ladies and gentlemen,

389
00:43:46.458 --> 00:43:48.669
that if we do find oil here,

390
00:43:48.752 --> 00:43:52.214
and I think there's a very good chance
that we will,

391
00:43:52.297 --> 00:43:56.844
this community of yours
will not only survive, it will flourish.

392
00:43:59.054 --> 00:44:02.099
I'd be happy to answer any questions
that you might have. Yes?

393
00:44:02.182 --> 00:44:04.727
Will the new road lead to the church?

394
00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:09.273
That'll be the first place that it leads.
Thank you, Eli. Anyone else?

395
00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:12.234
Well, if anything comes up,
I'm pretty easy to find.

396
00:44:12.317 --> 00:44:13.610
You just come visit with me.

397
00:44:13.694 --> 00:44:15.779
Thank you so much for your time,
and good night.

398
00:44:54.276 --> 00:44:59.281
<i>What a privilege to carry</i>

399
00:44:59.364 --> 00:45:03.285
<i>everything to God in prayer!</i>

400
00:45:04.203 --> 00:45:07.831
<i>What a privilege to carry...</i>

401
00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:27.017
Just follow the new road
right to the church.

402
00:45:27.101 --> 00:45:29.353
The new road will lead you there.

403
00:45:29.436 --> 00:45:31.146
Hello, brother, my name is Eli.

404
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:34.817
The Church of the Third Revelation
welcomes you.

405
00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:36.652
Hello, brother, my name is Eli.

406
00:45:36.735 --> 00:45:39.071
The Church of the Third Revelation
welcomes you.

407
00:45:39.196 --> 00:45:42.241
Just follow the new road
right to the church.

408
00:45:51.041 --> 00:45:54.670
<i>Jesus knows our every weakness</i>

409
00:45:56.463 --> 00:45:59.424
<i>Take it to the Lord in prayer</i>

410
00:46:00.634 --> 00:46:04.847
<i>Are we weak and heavy-laden</i>

411
00:46:05.848 --> 00:46:08.892
<i>Cumbered with a load of care?</i>

412
00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:13.230
<i>Precious Savior still our refuge</i>

413
00:46:15.232 --> 00:46:17.860
<i>Take it to the Lord in prayer...</i>

414
00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:32.916
- Daniel, may I speak with you?
- Yes, come in.

415
00:46:35.043 --> 00:46:38.046
I'll bring them up when they arrive.

416
00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:40.382
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

417
00:46:40.465 --> 00:46:42.426
How is all the work coming?

418
00:46:42.509 --> 00:46:43.969
Everything's good.

419
00:46:44.052 --> 00:46:47.222
- All the men are provided for?
- Of course.

420
00:46:49.266 --> 00:46:51.143
Spirits seem high.

421
00:46:53.604 --> 00:46:57.065
Is there anything
that you need from me?

422
00:47:00.110 --> 00:47:04.406
- Anything the church can do for you?
- I don't believe so. No. Thank you.

423
00:47:04.489 --> 00:47:06.867
I understand you've asked the people
to gather around

424
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:08.577
and watch the well begin tomorrow.
Is that right?

425
00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:10.662
- That's right.
- I will bless the well.

426
00:47:12.414 --> 00:47:15.125
Before you begin,
you should introduce me.

427
00:47:15.209 --> 00:47:17.794
You'll see me walk up
towards the oil well, and when I...

428
00:47:17.878 --> 00:47:18.962
The derrick.

429
00:47:19.046 --> 00:47:22.883
You'll see me walk up,
and then you could say my name.

430
00:47:22.966 --> 00:47:25.135
When you walk up?

431
00:47:25.219 --> 00:47:29.139
Yes. You'll see me walk up,
and then you could say,

432
00:47:29.223 --> 00:47:34.394
"The proud son of these hills
who tended his Father's flock,"

433
00:47:34.603 --> 00:47:37.022
and then you could say my name.

434
00:47:38.315 --> 00:47:39.900
That's fine.

435
00:47:40.859 --> 00:47:44.321
- And what happens then?
- Well, then we start the drill.

436
00:47:47.449 --> 00:47:51.119
It's a simple blessing, Daniel,
but an important one.

437
00:47:51.203 --> 00:47:54.206
It's just a few words. It won't take long.

438
00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:58.418
- What time?
- What time's good for you, Eli?

439
00:47:58.502 --> 00:48:01.338
- 4:00.
- Well, let's make it 4:00 then.

440
00:48:02.422 --> 00:48:06.176
- My thanks for your visit.
- Good day. Thank you.

441
00:48:21.566 --> 00:48:23.568
Afternoon, everyone.

442
00:48:24.861 --> 00:48:26.530
Come with me.

443
00:48:31.868 --> 00:48:35.372
I thank you all so much
for visiting with us at this time.

444
00:48:35.497 --> 00:48:37.291
I've had the pleasure of
meeting some of you

445
00:48:37.374 --> 00:48:39.251
and I hope very much
in the months to come,

446
00:48:39.376 --> 00:48:42.546
I'll be able to visit with
each and every one of you.

447
00:48:42.671 --> 00:48:45.382
I'm better at digging holes in the
ground than making speeches,

448
00:48:45.465 --> 00:48:47.050
so let's forget the speech
for this evening,

449
00:48:47.134 --> 00:48:49.052
just make it a simple blessing.

450
00:48:49.177 --> 00:48:50.971
You see, one man doesn't prospect
from the ground.

451
00:48:51.054 --> 00:48:54.975
It takes a whole community of
good people, such as yourselves,

452
00:48:55.058 --> 00:48:58.103
and this is good. We stay together.

453
00:48:58.186 --> 00:48:59.980
We pray together, we work together,

454
00:49:00.063 --> 00:49:03.066
and if the Good Lord smiles kindly
on our endeavor,

455
00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:05.652
we share in the wealth together.

456
00:49:08.071 --> 00:49:10.157
Now, before we spud in
Mary's Well Number One,

457
00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:13.410
named for the lovely
Miss Mary Sunday, here by my side,

458
00:49:13.493 --> 00:49:16.538
a proud daughter of these hills,

459
00:49:16.621 --> 00:49:20.375
I'd just like to say God bless these
honest labors of ours, and, of course,

460
00:49:20.459 --> 00:49:22.544
God bless you all.

461
00:49:22.627 --> 00:49:23.754
Amen.

462
00:49:23.837 --> 00:49:25.172
Now go.

463
00:49:30.093 --> 00:49:31.928
Won't be a minute.

464
00:49:34.931 --> 00:49:36.933
Fast as you can, H.W.

465
00:49:40.437 --> 00:49:42.606
Are you ready to do this?

466
00:49:52.407 --> 00:49:54.910
That's it, ladies and gentlemen!

467
00:49:58.789 --> 00:50:02.876
Al Rose has very generously provided
some refreshments for this occasion

468
00:50:02.959 --> 00:50:05.754
out of his own pocket. Thank you, Al.

469
00:50:06.463 --> 00:50:10.926
If you'll all just care to help yourselves,
I'll be back in a minute.

470
00:51:23.874 --> 00:51:25.417
Mary.

471
00:51:27.043 --> 00:51:28.712
Mary Sunday.

472
00:51:31.548 --> 00:51:34.301
- Do you like your new dress?
- Yes. Thank you.

473
00:51:34.384 --> 00:51:37.304
You're welcome. I thought you'd like it.

474
00:51:38.138 --> 00:51:40.724
- Are you happy I came here?
- Yes.

475
00:51:42.392 --> 00:51:46.104
Your daddy doesn't hit you anymore,
does he? Does he now?

476
00:51:46.938 --> 00:51:48.857
Better not, right?

477
00:51:49.483 --> 00:51:51.526
I'll take care of you.

478
00:51:52.569 --> 00:51:57.741
No more hitting, right?
No more hitting. Now go.

479
00:51:57.866 --> 00:52:00.911
Go and play some more
and don't come back.

480
00:52:10.003 --> 00:52:11.463
Daniel?

481
00:52:15.091 --> 00:52:19.304
It's okay, H.W. Go back to sleep.
Go on. Go back to sleep.

482
00:52:21.806 --> 00:52:23.016
Daniel.

483
00:52:25.393 --> 00:52:26.603
Daniel.

484
00:52:29.523 --> 00:52:30.815
Daniel!

485
00:52:32.359 --> 00:52:33.568
Daniel!

486
00:52:33.652 --> 00:52:34.945
What?

487
00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:38.949
Lost a man down the well.

488
00:52:43.453 --> 00:52:45.622
- What man?
- Joe Gundha.

489
00:52:47.582 --> 00:52:49.668
- Did I know him?
- No.

490
00:52:50.126 --> 00:52:51.253
What happened?

491
00:52:58.885 --> 00:53:00.303
Pick it up.

492
00:53:00.971 --> 00:53:02.556
Set the brake.

493
00:53:02.639 --> 00:53:04.975
- Tie it down.
- Tie it on.

494
00:53:09.563 --> 00:53:10.939
Shit!

495
00:53:12.983 --> 00:53:15.819
God damn it. Where's the body?

496
00:53:16.111 --> 00:53:19.155
- They're fishing it out now.
- All right.

497
00:53:22.492 --> 00:53:25.161
- Where's the bit?
- It's on the deck.

498
00:54:08.663 --> 00:54:11.541
Clean him up. Put some clothes on him.

499
00:54:12.626 --> 00:54:13.918
And...

500
00:54:15.545 --> 00:54:17.130
Set up a tent.

501
00:54:17.213 --> 00:54:21.217
Anyone goes down into the cellar,
you tell somebody. Yes?

502
00:54:21.801 --> 00:54:23.219
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

503
00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:29.225
Shut down till midday.

504
00:55:00.465 --> 00:55:05.887
And I had a vision.
Yes, last night, I had a vision

505
00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:08.932
and I felt God's breath
move through me.

506
00:55:12.519 --> 00:55:16.648
And it rolled down into my stomach.

507
00:55:18.608 --> 00:55:20.527
It sloshed around.

508
00:55:21.903 --> 00:55:25.782
And my stomach spoke in a whisper,
not a shout,

509
00:55:28.993 --> 00:55:33.248
"Touch this woman with your hands
and caress her." Yes.

510
00:55:37.585 --> 00:55:39.796
My dear Mrs. Hunter,

511
00:55:40.922 --> 00:55:43.299
you have arthritis, don't you?

512
00:55:43.383 --> 00:55:45.385
- Yes, I do, Eli.
- Yes.

513
00:55:45.468 --> 00:55:49.139
The devil is in your hands,
and I will suck it out.

514
00:55:50.265 --> 00:55:54.769
Now, I will not cast this ghost out
with a fever

515
00:55:54.853 --> 00:55:59.941
for the new spirit inside me has shown
me I have a new way to communicate.

516
00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:04.446
It is a gentle whisper.

517
00:56:10.785 --> 00:56:13.163
Get out of here, ghost.

518
00:56:15.707 --> 00:56:18.084
Get out of here, ghost.

519
00:56:20.086 --> 00:56:21.546
Get out.

520
00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:25.049
Get out of here, ghost.

521
00:56:27.385 --> 00:56:30.597
Get out of here, ghost.

522
00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:34.601
- ...and enter this woman's body now.
- Get out of here, ghost.

523
00:56:34.684 --> 00:56:39.564
Get out of here. Don't you dare turn
around and come back.

524
00:56:40.732 --> 00:56:42.442
For if you do,

525
00:56:42.525 --> 00:56:48.072
all the armies of my boot
will kick you in the teeth

526
00:56:48.198 --> 00:56:51.701
and you will be cast up
and thrown in the dirt

527
00:56:51.826 --> 00:56:54.204
and thrust back to perdition!

528
00:56:54.329 --> 00:56:58.041
And as long as I have teeth,
I will bite you,

529
00:56:58.166 --> 00:57:02.128
and if I have no teeth, I will gum you!

530
00:57:02.212 --> 00:57:05.965
And as long as I have fists,
I will bash you!

531
00:57:06.049 --> 00:57:10.845
Now, get out of here, ghost!
Get out of here, ghost!

532
00:57:10.929 --> 00:57:14.015
Get out of here, ghost!

533
00:57:17.143 --> 00:57:18.770
And it left!

534
00:57:19.521 --> 00:57:21.564
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

535
00:57:23.066 --> 00:57:25.527
- Praise the Lord and his holy days!
- Praise God!

536
00:57:25.610 --> 00:57:29.072
- Amen! Thank you.
- Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, God.

537
00:57:30.323 --> 00:57:32.534
My dear Mrs. Hunter.

538
00:57:36.079 --> 00:57:37.872
Dance with me.

539
00:57:45.088 --> 00:57:47.423
- Thanks for coming.
- It was a wonderful sermon.

540
00:57:47.507 --> 00:57:49.926
- Will I see you tomorrow?
- Yes.

541
00:57:54.931 --> 00:57:55.932
Eli.

542
00:57:58.434 --> 00:58:01.271
Had a tragedy at the well last night.

543
00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:04.190
Yes, I heard.

544
00:58:04.274 --> 00:58:06.693
Joe Gundha was a man
of considerable faith.

545
00:58:06.776 --> 00:58:11.030
So if you wish to say a few words,
his burial is at noon tomorrow.

546
00:58:11.114 --> 00:58:13.992
Daniel, this accident
could have been avoided.

547
00:58:14.117 --> 00:58:16.202
It is terrible to think of that well

548
00:58:16.286 --> 00:58:18.204
- working away out there...
- These men work in 12-hour shifts.

549
00:58:18.288 --> 00:58:19.289
- ...unblessed.
- They need their rest.

550
00:58:19.414 --> 00:58:21.165
If they don't have it,
they start to make stupid mistakes.

551
00:58:21.249 --> 00:58:24.043
I've seen the men drinking. Don't you
think that has something to do with this?

552
00:58:24.127 --> 00:58:25.628
We need these men well-rested
to bring in this well.

553
00:58:25.712 --> 00:58:27.881
They can't get that if they're up here
listening to your gospel,

554
00:58:27.964 --> 00:58:30.133
and then the well can't produce
and blow gold all over the place.

555
00:58:30.258 --> 00:58:32.260
I wish I had more time with Joe Gundha.

556
00:58:32.343 --> 00:58:33.595
More could have been done.

557
00:58:33.678 --> 00:58:38.725
Then the well can't produce
and blow gold all over the place.

558
00:58:45.023 --> 00:58:47.358
Now, would you see to it
that his personal possessions

559
00:58:47.442 --> 00:58:49.611
find their way
back to his family, please?

560
00:58:49.694 --> 00:58:51.195
Thank you.

561
00:58:51.696 --> 00:58:54.866
Heard you were planning
some renovations.

562
00:58:54.949 --> 00:58:57.952
Yes, our congregation
is growing strongly.

563
00:58:58.578 --> 00:59:03.082
- We need more room.
- That was one goddamn hell of a show.

564
00:59:04.167 --> 00:59:06.753
We were happy to have you, Daniel.

565
01:01:00.324 --> 01:01:02.118
Gas, gas, gas!

566
01:01:11.127 --> 01:01:14.297
Lights out! Wait here. Wait here.
Lights out!

567
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:26.225
Put that fire out!

568
01:01:53.044 --> 01:01:56.839
Is he hurt? H.W.!
Hand him down to me!

569
01:02:01.385 --> 01:02:03.679
- Hand him down!
- Here.

570
01:02:07.767 --> 01:02:09.894
- Got him?
- I've got him!

571
01:02:17.193 --> 01:02:18.569
Oh, God.

572
01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.378
Come on.

573
01:02:47.515 --> 01:02:49.100
Open the door.

574
01:03:03.906 --> 01:03:06.659
Let go. There you go. You're safe.
You're safe.

575
01:03:07.577 --> 01:03:11.455
You're safe now. I got you here.
You're safe. Let go, son.

576
01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:15.710
Tell me where it hurts.
Tell me where it hurts. Tell me where...

577
01:03:15.793 --> 01:03:17.295
- Did you see this?
- No.

578
01:03:17.378 --> 01:03:18.462
Tell me where it hurts.

579
01:03:18.546 --> 01:03:21.132
Where does it hurt you?
Where does it hurt you?

580
01:03:21.215 --> 01:03:24.927
- I can't hear my voice.
- Were you hit in the head?

581
01:03:25.595 --> 01:03:30.141
Were you hit in the head? Tell me!
You have to tell me if you were!

582
01:03:30.224 --> 01:03:32.268
I can't hear my voice.

583
01:03:41.235 --> 01:03:43.988
I have to go and deal with this now.
You wait here for me.

584
01:03:44.071 --> 01:03:47.909
You understand? You wait here for me.
I'll be back. I'll be back in a minute.

585
01:03:47.992 --> 01:03:49.202
- Wait here.
- Don't leave!

586
01:03:49.285 --> 01:03:53.623
I'm going to take care of you. Wait.
Stay here, son. I'm going to fix this.

587
01:03:53.706 --> 01:03:54.749
- Don't leave!
- You're going to be fine!

588
01:03:54.832 --> 01:03:55.875
Wait for me here!

589
01:03:55.958 --> 01:03:58.961
- Hold him down. Hold him down.
- Don't leave!

590
01:04:01.172 --> 01:04:03.841
Got to break the cables, Daniel!

591
01:04:03.966 --> 01:04:05.843
Get me a hammer!

592
01:04:12.141 --> 01:04:13.976
Get me a hammer!

593
01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.272
Here you go.

594
01:04:43.547 --> 01:04:44.924
Get back!

595
01:05:22.545 --> 01:05:23.838
- Michael!
- Sir!

596
01:05:23.921 --> 01:05:26.382
Take Dave and two of the fellas,
pick up some hoses...

597
01:05:26.465 --> 01:05:30.428
Billy, protect the roof.
Don't wait before it gets too hot.

598
01:05:52.783 --> 01:05:55.453
What are you looking
so miserable about?

599
01:05:55.578 --> 01:05:58.414
There's a whole ocean of oil
under our feet!

600
01:05:58.539 --> 01:06:01.250
No one can get at it except for me.

601
01:06:47.922 --> 01:06:49.548
H.W. okay?

602
01:06:50.508 --> 01:06:52.134
No, he isn't.

603
01:06:54.345 --> 01:06:56.722
- Where is he?
- Mess room.

604
01:08:35.905 --> 01:08:39.575
That's enough now.
That's enough, H.W. That's enough.

605
01:08:42.203 --> 01:08:45.247
Do you hear me?
Can you hear me in there?

606
01:08:51.003 --> 01:08:52.755
That's enough.

607
01:09:05.059 --> 01:09:07.853
- Grab his legs.
- I have his legs.

608
01:09:07.937 --> 01:09:09.855
- No. Nope.
- No, lad.

609
01:09:15.486 --> 01:09:17.196
Give me that.

610
01:09:21.408 --> 01:09:22.493
Steady. That's it.

611
01:09:22.576 --> 01:09:24.995
- Easy, boy. Easy.
- Soon be over.

612
01:09:25.079 --> 01:09:28.874
Yeah, and that's good.
Now the other side. Turn him over.

613
01:09:32.795 --> 01:09:33.796
Almost done.

614
01:09:37.299 --> 01:09:38.801
That's it.

615
01:09:39.635 --> 01:09:42.471
Come here. It's over. It's over.

616
01:11:48.722 --> 01:11:51.392
Who do we know in San Francisco

617
01:11:52.935 --> 01:11:55.729
or Los Angeles, who could work with...

618
01:11:58.232 --> 01:12:01.985
You know, we could...
Someone, a teacher for H.W.

619
01:12:06.281 --> 01:12:08.659
How could you figure out that?

620
01:12:09.493 --> 01:12:13.539
Now, call...
God damn it, what's his name?

621
01:12:13.622 --> 01:12:15.958
Bob Brody in San Francisco?

622
01:12:17.126 --> 01:12:20.212
Call Bob Brody
and get someone down here.

623
01:12:26.802 --> 01:12:28.721
I'll do it right away.

624
01:13:36.330 --> 01:13:38.624
When do we get our money, Daniel?

625
01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:48.217
Aren't you a healer?
And a vessel for the Holy Spirit?

626
01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:51.345
When are you coming over
and make my son hear again?

627
01:13:51.428 --> 01:13:52.596
Can't you do that?

628
01:13:52.679 --> 01:13:54.681
If you had let me bless the well,
this wouldn't have happened.

629
01:13:54.765 --> 01:13:57.601
- Daniel.
- You shouldn't have done that.

630
01:13:58.936 --> 01:14:03.273
You owe the Church of
the Third Revelation $5,000

631
01:14:03.357 --> 01:14:06.235
as part of the arrangement
that we made!

632
01:14:15.994 --> 01:14:20.833
Don't even try it, you little runt!
You splash around in here.

633
01:14:27.673 --> 01:14:29.591
That's it, that's it.

634
01:14:41.645 --> 01:14:44.356
I'm going to bury you underground, Eli.

635
01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:50.988
I'm going to bury you underground.

636
01:15:22.519 --> 01:15:25.314
You are a stupid man, Abel.

637
01:15:27.149 --> 01:15:31.820
You've let someone come in here
and walk all over us.

638
01:15:33.947 --> 01:15:38.410
You let him in and do his work here,

639
01:15:38.493 --> 01:15:42.539
and you are a stupid man
for what we could have had.

640
01:15:42.664 --> 01:15:46.585
I followed His word, Eli. I tried.

641
01:15:46.668 --> 01:15:49.463
You didn't do anything but sit down.

642
01:15:50.797 --> 01:15:53.300
You're lazy, and you're stupid.

643
01:15:56.970 --> 01:16:01.141
Do you think God is going
to save you for being stupid?

644
01:16:03.769 --> 01:16:06.355
He doesn't save stupid people, Abel.

645
01:16:09.691 --> 01:16:14.196
I will tear you apart for
what you've done, you stupid man!

646
01:16:14.279 --> 01:16:16.615
How did he come here?
Do you really know? I know!

647
01:16:16.698 --> 01:16:19.368
- Son, don't do this, please!
- Be quiet!

648
01:16:19.451 --> 01:16:24.539
Shut your mouth, Abel!
It was your stupid son!

649
01:16:24.623 --> 01:16:28.585
It was Paul who told him to come here.
I know it.

650
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:30.420
He went to him and he said,

651
01:16:30.504 --> 01:16:35.258
"My stupid, weak father
will give away his lots.

652
01:16:35.342 --> 01:16:38.845
"Go and take him."
And you let it happen.

653
01:16:43.350 --> 01:16:46.520
A stupid father to a stupid son.

654
01:16:52.109 --> 01:16:53.819
Get out of there!

655
01:17:24.474 --> 01:17:26.143
Can I help you?

656
01:17:27.686 --> 01:17:29.229
Daniel?

657
01:17:29.312 --> 01:17:33.108
- Who's that?
- My name is Henry.

658
01:17:34.026 --> 01:17:35.444
Yeah?

659
01:17:36.611 --> 01:17:38.030
I'm Henry.

660
01:17:39.531 --> 01:17:41.616
What can I do for you?

661
01:17:44.453 --> 01:17:48.290
I'm Henry Plainview.
I'm from Fond Du Lac.

662
01:17:50.792 --> 01:17:54.629
I'm your brother, from another mother.

663
01:17:56.882 --> 01:17:58.800
Ernest is my father.

664
01:18:03.096 --> 01:18:04.639
Who are you?

665
01:18:05.974 --> 01:18:07.267
Henry.

666
01:18:34.294 --> 01:18:38.799
- Mary Branch? Is that your mother?
- Yes, sir, that's right.

667
01:18:41.009 --> 01:18:46.181
I read about your gusher in the paper,
about your success.

668
01:18:46.306 --> 01:18:49.351
You heard about my strike?
You just show up?

669
01:18:50.352 --> 01:18:52.187
Our father's dead.

670
01:18:53.772 --> 01:18:57.025
Ernest died, I heard.
I wanted to find you.

671
01:18:57.109 --> 01:18:58.777
When?

672
01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:02.489
Three months ago.
I got a letter from Annabelle.

673
01:19:03.448 --> 01:19:05.367
My sister, Annabelle?

674
01:19:07.327 --> 01:19:11.039
- Where is she?
- Still at home. Fond Du Lac.

675
01:19:12.707 --> 01:19:16.211
You came all the way
from Wisconsin to tell me this?

676
01:19:16.336 --> 01:19:19.381
I'm coming from New Mexico.
I've been there.

677
01:19:20.549 --> 01:19:22.467
I came to find you.

678
01:19:23.552 --> 01:19:25.679
Did you know about me?

679
01:19:33.728 --> 01:19:35.981
Do you have identification?

680
01:19:36.606 --> 01:19:38.733
Do you have this letter?

681
01:20:01.882 --> 01:20:03.967
- Where are you coming from?
- From New Mexico.

682
01:20:04.050 --> 01:20:06.553
Yes, I know, but from where?

683
01:20:06.636 --> 01:20:09.723
Silver City.
I've been there for two years.

684
01:20:10.765 --> 01:20:15.604
I was trying drilling of my own for years.

685
01:20:15.687 --> 01:20:22.110
- Getting leases in Texas. Louisiana.
- Anything that produced?

686
01:20:22.194 --> 01:20:25.238
No. Not like your success, no.

687
01:20:31.703 --> 01:20:34.164
- Are you married?
- No.

688
01:20:34.623 --> 01:20:38.668
I spent time in jail.
I had a stretch of very bad time.

689
01:20:39.294 --> 01:20:42.547
I had nothing.
I was picked up in Louisiana.

690
01:20:44.007 --> 01:20:47.677
I worked on a chain gang
for six months building roads.

691
01:20:48.178 --> 01:20:51.389
That was a very hard time.

692
01:20:55.143 --> 01:20:56.978
Are you married?

693
01:20:58.188 --> 01:21:00.649
What were you in jail for?

694
01:21:00.732 --> 01:21:05.278
Believe it or not, for all the
terrible things I've gotten myself into,

695
01:21:05.362 --> 01:21:08.907
when they picked me up,
I hadn't done anything.

696
01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:12.827
But I've done my share of things

697
01:21:15.121 --> 01:21:17.540
that shouldn't be talked about.

698
01:21:40.021 --> 01:21:43.108
Drink it. Drink it!

699
01:22:25.650 --> 01:22:26.985
Come on.

700
01:22:58.600 --> 01:22:59.934
So...

701
01:23:04.731 --> 01:23:06.524
What do you want, Henry?

702
01:23:08.943 --> 01:23:10.362
Nothing.

703
01:23:13.448 --> 01:23:17.660
If you can spare something,
I can work for you in any way.

704
01:23:17.786 --> 01:23:22.123
I know I'll keep moving, before long,
to get back to Fond Du Lac.

705
01:23:23.124 --> 01:23:25.460
- Do you have any money?
- Some.

706
01:23:26.544 --> 01:23:28.713
- Not much.
- Just answer me directly.

707
01:23:28.797 --> 01:23:32.425
You say "nothing," then you say
you'd like to stay and work.

708
01:23:32.509 --> 01:23:37.472
And it's better, I'd just like to hear
you say you'd like to be here.

709
01:23:38.598 --> 01:23:40.517
I'd like to be here.

710
01:23:45.814 --> 01:23:51.486
I'm a good worker.
I worked cable tool rigs, built railroads.

711
01:23:53.613 --> 01:23:55.657
I won't need any favors.

712
01:24:00.662 --> 01:24:01.830
Good.

713
01:24:27.647 --> 01:24:29.858
<i>What did my mother know?</i>

714
01:24:32.402 --> 01:24:34.112
<i>I don't know.</i>

715
01:24:34.654 --> 01:24:39.200
<i>I don't know if she knew and looked
the other way, if she never knew.</i>

716
01:24:41.911 --> 01:24:43.705
<i>Why did you leave?</i>

717
01:24:45.623 --> 01:24:48.626
<i>I know you didn't get on with our father.</i>

718
01:24:53.798 --> 01:24:57.552
I worked for Geological Survey
and went to Kansas.

719
01:24:59.971 --> 01:25:03.057
I couldn't stay there. I just couldn't.

720
01:25:04.726 --> 01:25:07.312
I don't like to explain myself.

721
01:25:13.318 --> 01:25:17.572
- Are you an angry man, Henry?
- About what?

722
01:25:18.406 --> 01:25:22.202
Are you envious? Do you get envious?

723
01:25:23.453 --> 01:25:25.413
I don't think so, no.

724
01:25:29.876 --> 01:25:32.253
I have a competition in me.

725
01:25:33.421 --> 01:25:35.882
I want no one else to succeed.

726
01:25:40.887 --> 01:25:45.433
- I hate most people.
- That part of me is gone.

727
01:25:46.601 --> 01:25:49.521
Working and not succeeding,

728
01:25:49.604 --> 01:25:53.608
all my failures have left me...

729
01:25:56.611 --> 01:25:58.530
I just don't care.

730
01:26:00.198 --> 01:26:02.825
Well, if it's in me, it's in you.

731
01:26:04.327 --> 01:26:09.791
There are times when I look at people
and I see nothing worth liking.

732
01:26:15.755 --> 01:26:19.801
I want to earn enough money
I can get away from everyone.

733
01:26:24.806 --> 01:26:27.308
What will you do about your boy?

734
01:26:35.024 --> 01:26:36.693
I don't know.

735
01:26:38.194 --> 01:26:40.655
Maybe it'll change.

736
01:26:40.822 --> 01:26:45.243
Does your sound come back to you?
I don't know. Maybe no one knows that.

737
01:26:45.326 --> 01:26:49.539
- Doctor might not know that.
- Where's his mother?

738
01:26:55.503 --> 01:26:58.548
I don't want to talk about those things.

739
01:27:01.843 --> 01:27:04.137
I see the worst in people, Henry.

740
01:27:06.139 --> 01:27:10.018
I don't need to look past seeing them
to get all I need.

741
01:27:12.145 --> 01:27:16.149
I've built up my hatreds over the years,
little by little.

742
01:27:19.819 --> 01:27:23.197
Having you here
gives me a second breath of life.

743
01:27:24.365 --> 01:27:27.035
I can't keep doing this on my own

744
01:27:30.288 --> 01:27:35.376
with these people.

745
01:28:15.166 --> 01:28:17.752
Daniel! Daniel, wake up! Daniel!

746
01:30:00.021 --> 01:30:03.524
Just have to go and have a word
with the conductor.

747
01:30:04.275 --> 01:30:06.402
I'll be right back.

748
01:30:06.527 --> 01:30:11.240
You stay here. You understand?
You stay here.

749
01:30:12.283 --> 01:30:14.160
I'll be right back.

750
01:31:06.838 --> 01:31:08.714
No! No!

751
01:31:10.383 --> 01:31:11.634
No!

752
01:31:21.435 --> 01:31:23.020
- Tilford!
- Plainview.

753
01:31:23.104 --> 01:31:25.439
This is my brother,
Henry Plainview from Fond Du Lac.

754
01:31:25.523 --> 01:31:27.191
H.M. Tilford. Pleasure.

755
01:31:27.275 --> 01:31:29.777
Henry Plainview. J.J. Carter.

756
01:31:31.779 --> 01:31:33.197
So...

757
01:31:33.281 --> 01:31:34.949
- Shall we?
- Yes.

758
01:31:43.124 --> 01:31:45.334
How's your boy?

759
01:31:45.459 --> 01:31:48.838
- Thank you for asking.
- Is there anything we can do?

760
01:31:48.963 --> 01:31:51.382
Thanks for asking is enough.

761
01:31:53.009 --> 01:31:55.052
So what are your plans?

762
01:31:56.804 --> 01:32:00.057
Is this about buying up my tracts here?

763
01:32:00.141 --> 01:32:01.225
Yes.

764
01:32:01.309 --> 01:32:04.186
The cable was
about my Coyote Hills lease.

765
01:32:04.312 --> 01:32:08.482
- We'd like that, too.
- What's your offer on Coyote Hills?

766
01:32:08.608 --> 01:32:13.195
- We'll offer 150,000 for full title.
- That's a deal. What's next?

767
01:32:13.988 --> 01:32:18.576
You have 11,000 acres in Little Boston.
You have one proven well

768
01:32:18.659 --> 01:32:20.202
- that was damaged...
- I have three wells proven.

769
01:32:20.328 --> 01:32:24.415
You haven't been paying attention.
That's three proven wells.

770
01:32:28.669 --> 01:32:30.588
We'll make you a millionaire
while you're sitting here

771
01:32:30.671 --> 01:32:33.007
from one minute to the next.

772
01:32:34.842 --> 01:32:37.637
And what else would I do with myself?

773
01:32:39.347 --> 01:32:43.726
- Are you asking me?
- What else would I do with myself?

774
01:32:44.352 --> 01:32:46.479
Take care of your son.

775
01:32:48.105 --> 01:32:50.608
I don't know what you would do.

776
01:32:53.194 --> 01:32:55.696
If you were me and Standard
offered to buy what you had

777
01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:58.491
for a million dollars, why? So, why?

778
01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:00.826
You know why.

779
01:33:00.910 --> 01:33:02.787
Yeah, you fellas
should just scratch around in the dirt

780
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:06.332
and find it like the rest of us, instead of
buying up someone else's hard work.

781
01:33:06.415 --> 01:33:08.376
I've scratched around the dirt, son.

782
01:33:08.459 --> 01:33:10.503
You going to change
your shipping costs?

783
01:33:10.586 --> 01:33:13.589
We don't dictate shipping costs.
That's railroad business.

784
01:33:14.590 --> 01:33:17.259
You don't own the railroads?

785
01:33:21.222 --> 01:33:23.849
'Course you do. Of course you do.

786
01:33:25.518 --> 01:33:27.979
Where you going to put it all?

787
01:33:28.980 --> 01:33:30.439
Where?

788
01:33:32.233 --> 01:33:36.278
Build a pipeline? Make a deal
with Union Oil? Be my guest.

789
01:33:36.404 --> 01:33:38.072
But if you can't pull it off,

790
01:33:38.155 --> 01:33:42.284
you've got an ocean of oil
under your feet with nowhere to go.

791
01:33:43.244 --> 01:33:47.915
Why not turn it over to us?
We'll make you rich.

792
01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:50.376
You spend time with your boy.

793
01:33:51.419 --> 01:33:53.587
It's a great discovery.

794
01:33:54.463 --> 01:33:56.590
Now, let us help you.

795
01:34:05.766 --> 01:34:08.936
Did you just tell me
how to run my family?

796
01:34:09.020 --> 01:34:11.272
It might be more important now
that you've proven the field

797
01:34:11.355 --> 01:34:13.274
and we're offering to buy you out.

798
01:34:13.357 --> 01:34:15.609
One night I'm going to come to you,
inside of your house,

799
01:34:15.693 --> 01:34:18.696
or wherever you're sleeping,
and I'm going to cut your throat.

800
01:34:18.779 --> 01:34:19.947
What?

801
01:34:20.698 --> 01:34:21.991
What are you talking about?
Have you gone crazy?

802
01:34:22.074 --> 01:34:23.409
- Did you hear what I said?
- I heard what you said,

803
01:34:23.492 --> 01:34:25.995
- why did you say it?
- You don't tell me about my son.

804
01:34:26.078 --> 01:34:28.289
Why are you acting insane
and threatening to cut my throat?

805
01:34:28.372 --> 01:34:31.459
- You don't tell me about my son.
- I'm not telling you anything!

806
01:34:31.542 --> 01:34:35.379
I'm asking you to be reasonable.
If I've offended you, I apologize.

807
01:34:35.463 --> 01:34:37.673
You'll see what I can do.

808
01:34:45.514 --> 01:34:49.769
This parcel here is the 3,000-acre
ranch owned by B.L. Harper.

809
01:34:49.852 --> 01:34:52.396
This is San Luis Obispo County land.

810
01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:54.356
And from here to the coast,
it's all Union Oil.

811
01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:57.610
What's this? Why don't I own this?

812
01:35:00.529 --> 01:35:05.159
- Why don't I own this?
- That's the Bandy tract.

813
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:09.080
He was the holdout,
when we were doing the buying.

814
01:35:09.163 --> 01:35:11.665
He had hoped to speak with you.

815
01:35:15.836 --> 01:35:19.340
Can't you just build the pipeline
around this tract?

816
01:35:22.301 --> 01:35:26.347
Can I build around 50 miles
of Tehachapi mountains?

817
01:35:26.472 --> 01:35:29.016
Don't be thick in front of me, Al.

818
01:35:29.642 --> 01:35:33.354
- I can go to him again.
- No, I'll go and talk to the man.

819
01:35:33.479 --> 01:35:36.398
I'll talk to him. Show you how it's done.

820
01:35:40.194 --> 01:35:42.696
All right. Pack it up, Henry.

821
01:35:52.998 --> 01:35:56.919
- How big is his room?
- He's sharing with another boy.

822
01:35:57.044 --> 01:35:59.880
- Who?
- An older boy. About 12.

823
01:35:59.964 --> 01:36:03.050
He's been there for a year.
Named Ballard.

824
01:36:08.222 --> 01:36:12.643
- How big is the room?
- It's a fair size. Got enough space.

825
01:36:14.895 --> 01:36:18.190
Are you taking Henry with you
to meet Union Oil?

826
01:36:31.412 --> 01:36:34.999
- Are you the son of William Bandy?
- Grandson.

827
01:36:35.082 --> 01:36:36.917
- Is he here?
- No, he's out.

828
01:36:37.001 --> 01:36:38.085
Where is he?

829
01:36:38.210 --> 01:36:41.088
Told you, he's out.
Now, what do you want?

830
01:36:44.592 --> 01:36:48.512
I'm Daniel Plainview. I want to talk
with him about his property.

831
01:36:48.596 --> 01:36:53.517
- About what?
- I believe I'll talk with him about that.

832
01:36:53.934 --> 01:36:56.437
- You're that oilman, aren't you?
- That's right.

833
01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:58.522
We don't want you drilling out here.

834
01:36:58.606 --> 01:37:02.026
I don't want it either.
Now, when will he be back?

835
01:37:02.109 --> 01:37:03.194
Few days.

836
01:37:03.277 --> 01:37:05.863
Tell him I'd like to speak with him.
Not about drilling.

837
01:37:05.946 --> 01:37:08.240
And I'll be back in a week.

838
01:39:27.254 --> 01:39:29.423
Put that in a glass case.

839
01:39:30.299 --> 01:39:32.217
Here's to Union Oil.

840
01:39:32.885 --> 01:39:33.969
Hundred miles of pipeline,

841
01:39:34.094 --> 01:39:36.513
and all the independent producers
of this great state.

842
01:39:36.597 --> 01:39:37.598
Cheers.

843
01:40:02.790 --> 01:40:05.501
<i>There's that house in Fond Du Lac</i>

844
01:40:07.378 --> 01:40:10.672
<i>that John Hollister built.
Do you remember it?</i>

845
01:40:13.509 --> 01:40:16.970
I thought as a boy that was
the most beautiful house I'd ever seen,

846
01:40:17.054 --> 01:40:18.722
and I wanted it.

847
01:40:19.431 --> 01:40:21.934
I wanted to live in it.

848
01:40:22.017 --> 01:40:23.602
And eat in it.

849
01:40:24.395 --> 01:40:26.021
And clean it.

850
01:40:28.982 --> 01:40:33.320
And even as a boy, I wanted
to have children to run around in it.

851
01:40:34.988 --> 01:40:37.783
You can have
anything you'd like now, Daniel.

852
01:40:38.450 --> 01:40:40.119
And you should.

853
01:40:40.828 --> 01:40:45.541
- Where are you going to build it?
- Here, maybe. Near the ocean.

854
01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:51.255
Would you make it look like that house?

855
01:40:55.968 --> 01:40:59.471
I think if I saw that house now,
it'd make me sick.

856
01:41:05.853 --> 01:41:08.355
We can eat and get some women.

857
01:41:11.316 --> 01:41:13.485
Take them to the Peachtree dance.

858
01:41:17.197 --> 01:41:21.160
I say get liquored up and take them
to the Peachtree dance.

859
01:41:23.996 --> 01:41:25.247
Yeah.

860
01:42:44.159 --> 01:42:46.620
Can I have some money, please?

861
01:42:53.961 --> 01:42:56.463
Can I have some money, please?

862
01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:48.015
I want you to tell me something.

863
01:43:51.643 --> 01:43:52.853
What?

864
01:43:53.854 --> 01:43:57.357
What's the name of the farm
next to the Hill House?

865
01:44:08.368 --> 01:44:13.081
What was the name of the farm
next to the Hill House?

866
01:44:16.585 --> 01:44:19.630
- I can't remember...
- Who are you?

867
01:44:22.549 --> 01:44:24.426
I'll leave, Daniel.

868
01:44:26.178 --> 01:44:27.763
Who are you?

869
01:44:31.058 --> 01:44:32.643
I'm no one.

870
01:44:33.685 --> 01:44:35.979
Just let me get up and go.

871
01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:40.359
Do I have a brother?

872
01:44:44.279 --> 01:44:49.534
I met a man in King City
who said he was your brother.

873
01:44:52.037 --> 01:44:55.165
We were friends for months.

874
01:44:56.583 --> 01:44:58.585
Working in King City.

875
01:45:00.754 --> 01:45:03.715
And he wanted
to make his way to you, Daniel.

876
01:45:04.925 --> 01:45:07.094
We didn't have any money.

877
01:45:11.932 --> 01:45:14.267
He died of tuberculosis.

878
01:45:15.644 --> 01:45:17.521
He wasn't harmed.

879
01:45:18.522 --> 01:45:20.774
Wasn't killed, nothing bad.

880
01:45:22.609 --> 01:45:24.861
But he told me about you,

881
01:45:27.864 --> 01:45:30.200
and I just took his story,

882
01:45:33.870 --> 01:45:35.706
used his diary.

883
01:45:39.292 --> 01:45:40.293
Daniel.

884
01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:45.298
Daniel, I'm your friend.

885
01:45:47.467 --> 01:45:49.928
I'm not trying to hurt you.

886
01:45:50.011 --> 01:45:51.304
Never.

887
01:45:52.389 --> 01:45:53.974
Just survive.

888
01:45:54.474 --> 01:45:55.726
No!

889
01:49:05.332 --> 01:49:06.833
Who is it?

890
01:49:08.084 --> 01:49:09.586
I'm Bandy.

891
01:49:22.349 --> 01:49:24.225
Yes. Yes.

892
01:49:26.686 --> 01:49:28.480
William Bandy.

893
01:49:31.650 --> 01:49:34.319
Yeah, I'd like to lease your land.

894
01:49:36.696 --> 01:49:40.283
I had asked for you
to come and talk to me before.

895
01:49:40.367 --> 01:49:42.702
When you were leasing land.

896
01:49:43.870 --> 01:49:45.705
That's right, yes.

897
01:49:47.374 --> 01:49:49.960
My boy's been very sick, you know.

898
01:49:51.044 --> 01:49:53.630
This was before your boy got sick.

899
01:49:56.716 --> 01:50:01.262
Now, I know
that you would like to build a pipeline

900
01:50:01.388 --> 01:50:04.057
through my property.

901
01:50:04.140 --> 01:50:08.311
- Is that right, what I've heard?
- It's absolutely right. And,

902
01:50:08.979 --> 01:50:09.980
well...

903
01:50:11.231 --> 01:50:14.567
Eight inch pipe.
It could be buried with your consent.

904
01:50:14.651 --> 01:50:17.237
I guarantee you
absolutely no disruption...

905
01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:18.530
God.

906
01:50:20.365 --> 01:50:22.993
God has told me what you must do.

907
01:50:27.330 --> 01:50:29.082
And what is that?

908
01:50:30.041 --> 01:50:33.962
You should be washed
in the blood of Jesus Christ.

909
01:50:35.755 --> 01:50:37.716
But I am.

910
01:50:39.217 --> 01:50:41.928
I have been washed, Mr. Bandy.
I have been.

911
01:50:42.053 --> 01:50:47.767
It's your only way to salvation.
And your only way for what you want.

912
01:50:49.602 --> 01:50:53.189
You can take it at
the Church of the Third Revelation.

913
01:50:55.608 --> 01:50:57.610
I'll pay you $3,000.

914
01:51:00.196 --> 01:51:02.991
I'd like you to be part of our church.

915
01:51:04.868 --> 01:51:06.786
I'll pay you $5,000.

916
01:51:07.871 --> 01:51:09.372
Be baptized.

917
01:51:10.707 --> 01:51:14.586
Be forgiven for the sin that you've done.

918
01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:23.720
What sin are you referring to,
Mr. Bandy?

919
01:51:24.846 --> 01:51:26.765
My sin of drilling?

920
01:52:17.482 --> 01:52:21.528
<i>I truly wish everyone could be saved,
don't you?</i>

921
01:52:21.611 --> 01:52:23.530
<i>Yes.</i>

922
01:52:23.613 --> 01:52:26.366
<i>I am afraid that's just not the case.</i>

923
01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:31.704
The doctrine of universal salvation
is a lie, is it not?

924
01:52:31.830 --> 01:52:34.457
- It's a lie.
- It's a lie.

925
01:52:34.541 --> 01:52:39.379
I wish everyone could be saved,
but they won't. No, they won't.

926
01:52:39.462 --> 01:52:42.966
You will never be saved if you...

927
01:52:43.049 --> 01:52:45.051
Reject the blood.

928
01:52:45.844 --> 01:52:47.053
Good.

929
01:52:48.054 --> 01:52:52.559
Now, is there a sinner here
looking for salvation?

930
01:52:55.228 --> 01:52:56.855
A new member?

931
01:53:01.276 --> 01:53:03.069
I'll ask it again.

932
01:53:05.071 --> 01:53:07.782
Is there a sinner here looking for God?

933
01:53:07.907 --> 01:53:09.075
Yes.

934
01:53:13.163 --> 01:53:14.622
Allow me.

935
01:53:16.833 --> 01:53:19.627
Thank you for coming, brother Daniel.

936
01:53:21.754 --> 01:53:23.423
Thank you, Eli.

937
01:53:24.507 --> 01:53:29.637
We have a sinner with us here
who wishes for salvation!

938
01:53:29.721 --> 01:53:33.349
- Daniel, are you a sinner?
- Yes.

939
01:53:33.433 --> 01:53:36.144
The Lord can't hear you, Daniel.

940
01:53:36.227 --> 01:53:40.106
Say it to him. Go ahead
and speak to him. It's all right.

941
01:53:40.857 --> 01:53:43.193
- Yes.
- Down on your knees.

942
01:53:43.276 --> 01:53:44.861
Pray to him.

943
01:53:46.237 --> 01:53:50.617
Look up to the sky and say it.

944
01:53:53.203 --> 01:53:55.413
What do you want me to say?

945
01:53:56.414 --> 01:54:00.919
Daniel, you've come here and
you've brought good and wealth,

946
01:54:01.002 --> 01:54:05.215
but you have also brought
your bad habits as a backslider.

947
01:54:05.298 --> 01:54:09.594
You've lusted after women,
and you have abandoned your child.

948
01:54:09.677 --> 01:54:12.764
Your child, that you raised,
you have abandoned

949
01:54:12.847 --> 01:54:15.308
all because he was sick
and you have sinned.

950
01:54:15.433 --> 01:54:17.602
So say it now. I am a sinner.

951
01:54:17.685 --> 01:54:19.604
- I am a sinner.
- Say it louder.

952
01:54:19.687 --> 01:54:22.482
- I am a sinner.
- I am a sinner.

953
01:54:22.565 --> 01:54:24.484
Louder, Daniel! I am a sinner!

954
01:54:24.609 --> 01:54:27.570
- I am a sinner.
- I am sorry, Lord.

955
01:54:27.654 --> 01:54:29.822
- I am sorry, Lord.
- I want the blood.

956
01:54:29.948 --> 01:54:33.326
- I want the blood.
- You have abandoned your child.

957
01:54:34.077 --> 01:54:35.411
I have abandoned my child.

958
01:54:35.495 --> 01:54:37.830
- I will never backslide.
- I will never backslide.

959
01:54:37.956 --> 01:54:41.000
I was lost, but now I am found.

960
01:54:41.084 --> 01:54:45.004
- I was lost, but now I'm found.
- I have abandoned my child.

961
01:54:46.756 --> 01:54:49.926
Say it. Say it.

962
01:54:50.009 --> 01:54:53.096
- I abandoned my child.
- Say it louder. Say it louder!

963
01:54:53.179 --> 01:54:55.306
I've abandoned my child!

964
01:54:56.182 --> 01:54:58.726
I've abandoned my child!

965
01:54:58.851 --> 01:55:00.853
I've abandoned my boy!

966
01:55:00.979 --> 01:55:03.398
Now beg for the blood!

967
01:55:04.565 --> 01:55:06.442
Just give me the blood, Eli.
Let me get out of here.

968
01:55:06.526 --> 01:55:09.320
Give me the blood, Lord,
and let me get away!

969
01:55:09.404 --> 01:55:13.199
Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your Lord and Savior?

970
01:55:13.324 --> 01:55:16.077
- Yes, I do.
- Get out of here, devil!

971
01:55:16.202 --> 01:55:19.038
Out, devil! Out, sin!

972
01:55:19.163 --> 01:55:21.708
- Let me feel the power of the Lord, Eli.
- Do you accept

973
01:55:21.833 --> 01:55:25.712
the Church of the Third Revelation
as your spiritual guide?

974
01:55:27.213 --> 01:55:31.467
- Get out of here, ghost!
- Where is your Lord, Eli?

975
01:55:31.551 --> 01:55:35.680
- Get out! Go back where you belong!
- Where is he? There he is!

976
01:55:35.763 --> 01:55:39.392
Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your Savior?

977
01:55:39.475 --> 01:55:40.935
Yes, I do.

978
01:55:43.688 --> 01:55:48.026
<i>Would you be free
from the burden of sin?</i>

979
01:55:48.109 --> 01:55:50.486
<i>There's power in the blood</i>

980
01:55:50.570 --> 01:55:52.655
<i>Power in the blood</i>

981
01:55:52.905 --> 01:55:54.699
<i>Would you o'er evil a victory win?</i>

982
01:55:54.782 --> 01:55:57.035
There's a pipeline.

983
01:55:57.118 --> 01:56:01.331
<i>There's wonderful power in the blood</i>

984
01:56:01.414 --> 01:56:05.835
<i>There is power, power
wonder-working power</i>

985
01:56:05.918 --> 01:56:09.630
<i>In the blood of the Lamb</i>

986
01:56:09.714 --> 01:56:11.507
Praise the Lord!

987
01:56:16.095 --> 01:56:18.973
Welcome to the fold, brother Plainview.

988
01:56:30.276 --> 01:56:32.612
Welcome, brother Daniel.
God bless you.

989
01:56:33.821 --> 01:56:35.281
God bless you.

990
01:56:38.451 --> 01:56:40.119
- Hallelujah.
- Amen.

991
01:56:40.536 --> 01:56:42.497
Welcome home, brother.

992
01:56:43.122 --> 01:56:46.626
That's enough. That's enough, now.

993
01:56:48.795 --> 01:56:53.007
He must take the spirit in on his own.

994
01:56:55.760 --> 01:56:57.637
We have a new member.

995
01:56:57.762 --> 01:56:59.889
- Yes, brother.
- Hallelujah.

996
01:56:59.972 --> 01:57:01.974
- Hallelujah.
- Amen.

997
01:57:04.143 --> 01:57:06.229
- My sweet Mary.
- Mr. Plainview has been generous

998
01:57:06.312 --> 01:57:09.107
enough to make a $5,000 donation

999
01:57:09.190 --> 01:57:12.276
to the church
which we are still waiting for.

1000
01:58:24.348 --> 01:58:27.685
That does me good.
That does me good.

1001
01:58:29.729 --> 01:58:31.606
Welcome home, son.

1002
01:58:34.233 --> 01:58:36.235
Welcome home, son.

1003
01:58:40.114 --> 01:58:42.200
This here's George Reynolds.
Teacher from the deaf school.

1004
01:58:42.283 --> 01:58:45.328
- Mr. Plainview.
- Fletcher.

1005
01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:50.249
You're too heavy for me.

1006
01:58:53.252 --> 01:58:56.005
Do you want to get something to eat?

1007
01:58:57.173 --> 01:59:01.511
That's the pipeline, see?
All the way to the sea.

1008
01:59:22.573 --> 01:59:24.158
Come here.

1009
01:59:30.998 --> 01:59:32.792
I love you, son.

1010
01:59:34.710 --> 01:59:36.879
Let's take a look at you.

1011
01:59:39.131 --> 01:59:42.009
All right. That's it, that's it. That's it.

1012
02:00:06.033 --> 02:00:09.370
Let's get some decent food
inside of you.

1013
02:00:09.453 --> 02:00:13.291
That's all we need here
is a good, strong, expensive meal.

1014
02:00:13.874 --> 02:00:15.418
You hungry?

1015
02:00:16.460 --> 02:00:17.587
- Waiter?
- Yes, sir.

1016
02:00:17.670 --> 02:00:20.715
Two steaks, a whiskey,
and water for him.

1017
02:00:22.300 --> 02:00:24.844
- And goat's milk.
- Very good, sir.

1018
02:00:31.642 --> 02:00:34.604
We're going to have
this teacher help you.

1019
02:00:35.146 --> 02:00:39.692
He's going to help take care
of all of this. Understand?

1020
02:00:39.775 --> 02:00:42.528
'Cause I need you. Need your help.

1021
02:00:42.612 --> 02:00:46.616
Got everything we need now
to build this company. Come here.

1022
02:00:54.373 --> 02:00:56.125
Good afternoon.

1023
02:01:12.224 --> 02:01:14.310
- How are you doing?
- It's nice to see you again.

1024
02:01:14.393 --> 02:01:17.229
- We need four.
- I'll have them right up.

1025
02:01:21.359 --> 02:01:23.361
- Good afternoon, Daniel.
- Tilford.

1026
02:01:23.444 --> 02:01:24.862
Good afternoon.

1027
02:01:26.405 --> 02:01:31.702
- Hello! H.M. Tilford!
- You don't have to shout.

1028
02:01:33.704 --> 02:01:35.122
Pleasure.

1029
02:01:39.835 --> 02:01:42.129
It's good to be in Little B.

1030
02:01:43.381 --> 02:01:46.717
- Could use some rain out here.
- Yeah, we could.

1031
02:01:47.551 --> 02:01:50.680
- There we go.
- R.J., how's the London broil?

1032
02:01:50.763 --> 02:01:53.474
Believe we ordered these drinks
before those people.

1033
02:01:53.557 --> 02:01:57.853
- R.J., tell us. How's the London broil?
- Excuse me, gentlemen. Sorry.

1034
02:01:59.897 --> 02:02:03.859
I am sorry about that, sir.
I'll have your steaks right out.

1035
02:02:13.661 --> 02:02:16.288
- So that green turtle soup is fantastic.
- Is it?

1036
02:02:16.372 --> 02:02:18.040
It's delicious.

1037
02:02:23.003 --> 02:02:24.004
Sounds good to me.

1038
02:02:24.130 --> 02:02:29.885
So Standard offered us a million
dollars for the Little Boston leases.

1039
02:02:29.969 --> 02:02:32.888
I told H.M. Tilford
where he could shove that.

1040
02:02:32.972 --> 02:02:37.643
And we made a deal with Union!
On the pipeline!

1041
02:02:37.727 --> 02:02:41.230
And that whole ocean of oil
underneath our fields.

1042
02:02:41.313 --> 02:02:42.982
- ...$150,000.
- Yes.

1043
02:02:43.065 --> 02:02:45.401
We needed the money to drill.

1044
02:02:45.484 --> 02:02:47.737
- Who is this guy?
- I go out to meet him.

1045
02:02:47.820 --> 02:02:50.656
He's getting oil on the property.
We're trying to make a claim on it.

1046
02:02:50.740 --> 02:02:52.658
Offered him a million dollars.

1047
02:02:52.783 --> 02:02:55.995
- Turned us down flat.
- Well, I'm hungry.

1048
02:02:56.120 --> 02:03:00.750
Orange fritters,
mashed potatoes, green peas.

1049
02:03:00.833 --> 02:03:03.335
- All the way around?
- All right.

1050
02:03:06.213 --> 02:03:07.631
Hold on.

1051
02:03:11.343 --> 02:03:13.637
I want you to look over there.

1052
02:03:13.721 --> 02:03:16.557
- Daniel, let me introduce...
- Look over there. You see?

1053
02:03:16.682 --> 02:03:18.768
That's my son. See him?

1054
02:03:18.851 --> 02:03:21.187
- Yes.
- Do you see?

1055
02:03:23.522 --> 02:03:24.982
I see him.

1056
02:03:25.816 --> 02:03:28.694
You don't tell me
how to raise my family.

1057
02:03:30.821 --> 02:03:34.408
I told you not to tell me
how to raise my family.

1058
02:03:35.868 --> 02:03:37.745
Daniel...

1059
02:03:38.537 --> 02:03:40.414
So what do you see?

1060
02:03:42.374 --> 02:03:45.586
- I'm very happy for you that the deal...
- Yes, I made a deal with Union.

1061
02:03:45.669 --> 02:03:48.047
- My son is happy. He's safe.
- Congratulations.

1062
02:03:48.130 --> 02:03:51.342
- I'm taking care of him now, so...
- Excellent.

1063
02:03:52.593 --> 02:03:55.638
You look like a fool, don't you, Tilford?

1064
02:04:00.267 --> 02:04:03.145
- Yes.
- Yes.

1065
02:04:04.939 --> 02:04:06.649
Yes, you do.

1066
02:04:07.525 --> 02:04:09.026
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1067
02:04:09.318 --> 02:04:12.571
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Excuse him, gentlemen.

1068
02:04:16.075 --> 02:04:18.744
I told you what I was going to do.

1069
02:04:29.004 --> 02:04:30.256
My son.

1070
02:04:48.315 --> 02:04:51.652
Mr. Sunday, I understand
that you're leaving our fair community.

1071
02:04:51.777 --> 02:04:54.905
- Yes, I'm going on a mission.
- Where you going?

1072
02:04:54.989 --> 02:04:57.199
Oildale, Taft,
and then on to Bakersfield.

1073
02:04:57.283 --> 02:04:59.660
Well, I want you to know...

1074
02:04:59.785 --> 02:05:01.662
Three quarters of an hour.

1075
02:05:01.787 --> 02:05:03.330
...you done a great job for us.

1076
02:05:03.455 --> 02:05:06.333
- Thank you. You will be in my prayers.
- I thank you very much.

1077
02:05:06.417 --> 02:05:09.712
Union Oil Company,
Santa Paula, California.

1078
02:07:18.674 --> 02:07:22.511
"The woman saith unto him,
'Sir, give me this water

1079
02:07:23.512 --> 02:07:28.517
"'and I shall thirst not,
neither come hither to draw."'

1080
02:09:09.993 --> 02:09:11.703
Come in, come in.

1081
02:09:38.397 --> 02:09:40.649
Can we be alone?

1082
02:09:40.732 --> 02:09:44.486
This is my closest associate.
He hears everything.

1083
02:09:51.535 --> 02:09:56.623
- I'd prefer to speak to you in private.
- You can't speak.

1084
02:09:56.707 --> 02:09:58.917
So why don't you flap your hands about

1085
02:09:59.001 --> 02:10:02.588
and have what's-his-name tell me
where you've been.

1086
02:10:10.596 --> 02:10:13.348
Or do you think I don't know?

1087
02:10:27.779 --> 02:10:30.073
This is hard for me to say.

1088
02:10:31.116 --> 02:10:35.287
I'll tell you first, I love you very much.

1089
02:10:38.540 --> 02:10:42.586
I've learned to love what I do
because of you.

1090
02:10:45.964 --> 02:10:47.883
I'm leaving here.

1091
02:10:49.301 --> 02:10:51.637
I'm going to Mexico.

1092
02:10:51.762 --> 02:10:54.765
I'm taking Mary,
and I'm going to Mexico.

1093
02:10:56.391 --> 02:10:58.518
I miss working outside.

1094
02:10:59.519 --> 02:11:01.438
I miss the fields.

1095
02:11:04.358 --> 02:11:06.526
It'll only be for a time,

1096
02:11:07.694 --> 02:11:10.030
for me to do my own drilling

1097
02:11:11.740 --> 02:11:13.909
and start my own company.

1098
02:11:16.870 --> 02:11:21.375
It's time to make a change.

1099
02:11:34.388 --> 02:11:36.932
This makes you my competitor.

1100
02:11:40.852 --> 02:11:46.024
- No. No, it's not like that.
- It is like that, boy.

1101
02:11:47.192 --> 02:11:49.194
Your own company, huh?

1102
02:11:49.611 --> 02:11:51.154
That's right.

1103
02:11:53.448 --> 02:11:55.242
In Mexico?

1104
02:11:56.702 --> 02:11:57.786
Yes.

1105
02:11:57.869 --> 02:12:02.958
You are making such a misstep.
So, what are you doing?

1106
02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:08.338
I know you and I
have disagreed over many things.

1107
02:12:09.214 --> 02:12:13.593
I'd rather keep you as my father
than my partner.

1108
02:12:13.677 --> 02:12:15.178
Then say it.

1109
02:12:15.262 --> 02:12:17.014
If you've got something to say to me,
then say it.

1110
02:12:17.097 --> 02:12:20.767
I'd like to hear you speak
instead of your little dog.

1111
02:12:38.869 --> 02:12:41.580
I'm going to Mexico with my wife.

1112
02:12:42.539 --> 02:12:44.708
I'm going away from you.

1113
02:12:50.714 --> 02:12:53.425
That wasn't so hard, was it?

1114
02:12:55.302 --> 02:12:57.971
Killing us with what you're doing.

1115
02:13:00.849 --> 02:13:04.353
You're killing my image of you
as my son.

1116
02:13:04.436 --> 02:13:07.856
You are stubborn. You won't listen.

1117
02:13:07.939 --> 02:13:10.275
You're not my son.

1118
02:13:10.359 --> 02:13:13.570
Please don't say that.
I know you don't mean it.

1119
02:13:13.653 --> 02:13:17.657
It's the truth. You're not my son.
You never have been.

1120
02:13:18.992 --> 02:13:20.827
You're an orphan!

1121
02:13:23.538 --> 02:13:25.791
Did you ever hear that word?

1122
02:13:27.292 --> 02:13:29.211
Tell him what I said.

1123
02:13:29.961 --> 02:13:32.923
You operated here today like one.

1124
02:13:34.508 --> 02:13:37.010
I should have seen this coming.

1125
02:13:38.470 --> 02:13:43.350
I should have known that,
under this all, these past years

1126
02:13:43.475 --> 02:13:46.853
you've been building new hate for me,
piece by piece.

1127
02:13:46.978 --> 02:13:50.607
I don't even know who you are
because you have none of me in you.

1128
02:13:50.690 --> 02:13:53.610
You're someone else's.

1129
02:13:54.986 --> 02:13:58.490
This anger. Your maliciousness.

1130
02:13:59.574 --> 02:14:02.494
Backwards dealings with me.

1131
02:14:04.162 --> 02:14:08.166
You're an orphan from a basket
in the middle of the desert.

1132
02:14:10.919 --> 02:14:15.924
And I took you for no other reason
than I needed a sweet face to buy land.

1133
02:14:17.384 --> 02:14:19.177
Did you get that?

1134
02:14:20.387 --> 02:14:22.180
So now you know.

1135
02:14:25.475 --> 02:14:29.855
Look at me!
You're lower than a bastard.

1136
02:14:54.713 --> 02:14:59.217
You have none of me in you.
You're just a bastard from a basket.

1137
02:15:08.894 --> 02:15:13.190
I thank God I have none of you in me.

1138
02:15:18.069 --> 02:15:22.574
Not my son.
Just a little piece of competition.

1139
02:15:24.409 --> 02:15:26.578
Bastard from a basket.

1140
02:15:28.914 --> 02:15:31.166
Bastard from a basket!

1141
02:15:39.549 --> 02:15:42.093
You're a bastard from a basket!

1142
02:16:44.614 --> 02:16:46.449
<i>Get up, Mr. Daniel.</i>

1143
02:16:50.787 --> 02:16:52.372
<i>Mr. Daniel.</i>

1144
02:16:54.332 --> 02:16:56.918
Mr. Daniel, you've got a visitor.

1145
02:17:00.547 --> 02:17:02.424
Wake up, Mr. Daniel.

1146
02:17:05.135 --> 02:17:06.720
Sir?

1147
02:17:20.191 --> 02:17:22.193
You can leave us now.

1148
02:17:30.452 --> 02:17:31.453
Daniel.

1149
02:17:34.789 --> 02:17:35.999
Daniel.

1150
02:17:38.543 --> 02:17:41.796
Daniel Plainview, the house is on fire!

1151
02:17:46.426 --> 02:17:49.471
Brother Daniel, it's Eli.

1152
02:17:59.689 --> 02:18:03.443
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

1153
02:18:05.528 --> 02:18:07.489
I'll make us a drink.

1154
02:18:14.037 --> 02:18:17.248
Your home is a miracle.

1155
02:18:18.416 --> 02:18:20.085
It's beautiful.

1156
02:18:20.710 --> 02:18:22.796
God bless it.

1157
02:18:22.921 --> 02:18:26.925
I've been spreading His word
far and wide.

1158
02:18:28.176 --> 02:18:30.011
Far and wide.

1159
02:18:31.763 --> 02:18:34.599
So much travel for Him.

1160
02:18:39.270 --> 02:18:41.690
I've been working in radio.

1161
02:18:44.359 --> 02:18:48.363
Yes, so much...
So much has been happening.

1162
02:18:49.364 --> 02:18:54.911
To be here and find you
and see you well is wonderful.

1163
02:18:54.994 --> 02:18:57.622
And we have a chance to catch up.

1164
02:19:10.719 --> 02:19:12.804
No. Thank you so much.

1165
02:19:30.864 --> 02:19:32.449
My brother.

1166
02:19:33.825 --> 02:19:37.120
Daniel, my brother by marriage.

1167
02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:43.209
We're such old friends. So much time.

1168
02:19:49.674 --> 02:19:52.802
Things go up, things go down,

1169
02:19:52.886 --> 02:19:57.223
but at least the Lord is always around.

1170
02:19:58.808 --> 02:20:01.519
We've seen ups and downs,
haven't we?

1171
02:20:05.315 --> 02:20:08.318
Are things down for you right now, Eli?

1172
02:20:09.652 --> 02:20:11.070
No. No.

1173
02:20:13.490 --> 02:20:16.159
But I do come with some sad news.

1174
02:20:17.869 --> 02:20:20.622
Perhaps you remember Mr. Bandy?

1175
02:20:23.208 --> 02:20:26.586
Mr. Bandy has passed on to the Lord.

1176
02:20:27.504 --> 02:20:30.673
He lived to be 99 years old,
God bless him.

1177
02:20:31.341 --> 02:20:35.220
Mr. Bandy has a grandson.
Have you met his grandson, William?

1178
02:20:36.221 --> 02:20:40.809
William Bandy is one of
the finest members we have

1179
02:20:40.892 --> 02:20:43.478
at the Church of the Third Revelation.

1180
02:20:43.561 --> 02:20:46.898
He's eager to come to Hollywood
to be in movies.

1181
02:20:48.358 --> 02:20:50.568
He is very good-looking.

1182
02:20:52.737 --> 02:20:57.742
- And I do think he will have success.
- That's wonderful.

1183
02:20:59.869 --> 02:21:02.664
Would you like me to speak with him?

1184
02:21:10.088 --> 02:21:14.843
Daniel, I'm asking
if you'd like to have business

1185
02:21:14.926 --> 02:21:17.178
with the Church of the Third Revelation

1186
02:21:17.262 --> 02:21:21.558
in developing this lease
on young Bandy's 1,000-acre tract.

1187
02:21:23.977 --> 02:21:25.603
I'm offering you to drill

1188
02:21:25.728 --> 02:21:29.190
on one of the great undeveloped fields
of Little Boston.

1189
02:21:29.274 --> 02:21:33.444
- I'd be happy to work with you.
- You would?

1190
02:21:34.988 --> 02:21:37.866
Yes, yes, of course. That's wonderful.

1191
02:21:37.949 --> 02:21:40.952
But there is one condition for this work.

1192
02:21:41.035 --> 02:21:42.579
All right.

1193
02:21:44.622 --> 02:21:48.167
I'd like you to tell me
that you are a false prophet.

1194
02:21:53.506 --> 02:21:58.970
I'd like you to tell me that you are,
and have been a false prophet.

1195
02:22:00.138 --> 02:22:02.515
And that God is a superstition.

1196
02:22:08.605 --> 02:22:10.440
But that's a lie.

1197
02:22:13.192 --> 02:22:15.820
It's a lie. I cannot say it.

1198
02:22:30.043 --> 02:22:32.462
- When can we begin to drill?
- Very soon.

1199
02:22:32.545 --> 02:22:34.172
How long will it take
to bring in the well?

1200
02:22:34.297 --> 02:22:36.215
It shouldn't take long.

1201
02:22:36.341 --> 02:22:39.594
I would like a $100,000 signing bonus,

1202
02:22:39.677 --> 02:22:43.014
plus the five that is owed to me
with interest.

1203
02:22:43.681 --> 02:22:45.475
That's only fair.

1204
02:22:51.189 --> 02:22:56.027
I am a false prophet,
and God is a superstition.

1205
02:22:56.110 --> 02:22:59.113
If that's what you believe,
then I will say it.

1206
02:22:59.197 --> 02:23:02.700
- Say it like you mean it.
- Daniel.

1207
02:23:03.201 --> 02:23:05.578
Say it like it's your sermon.

1208
02:23:08.706 --> 02:23:10.375
Don't smile.

1209
02:23:16.130 --> 02:23:18.049
I am a false prophet.

1210
02:23:18.132 --> 02:23:21.552
- God is a superstition.
- Why don't you stand up?

1211
02:23:24.555 --> 02:23:26.599
Put your glass down.

1212
02:23:38.736 --> 02:23:42.323
I am a false prophet.

1213
02:23:42.407 --> 02:23:45.493
- God is a superstition.
- Eli, stop.

1214
02:23:45.576 --> 02:23:51.040
Just imagine this is your church here
and you have a full congregation, so...

1215
02:23:53.543 --> 02:23:57.338
I am a false prophet.
God is a superstition.

1216
02:23:57.422 --> 02:23:59.048
Say it again.

1217
02:24:00.091 --> 02:24:03.970
I am a false prophet.
God is a superstition.

1218
02:24:04.053 --> 02:24:05.221
They can't hear you at the back.

1219
02:24:05.304 --> 02:24:08.725
I am a false prophet.
God is a superstition.

1220
02:24:08.808 --> 02:24:09.892
Say it again.

1221
02:24:09.976 --> 02:24:14.647
I am a false prophet!
God is a superstition!

1222
02:24:14.731 --> 02:24:16.441
Say it again.

1223
02:24:16.524 --> 02:24:20.278
I am a false prophet!
God is a superstition!

1224
02:24:21.446 --> 02:24:23.823
Those areas have been drilled.

1225
02:24:26.951 --> 02:24:28.369
What?

1226
02:24:28.453 --> 02:24:31.122
Those areas, they've been drilled.

1227
02:24:32.665 --> 02:24:36.210
- No, they haven't.
- Yes, it's...

1228
02:24:36.294 --> 02:24:37.670
It's called drainage, Eli.

1229
02:24:37.795 --> 02:24:42.633
See, I own everything around it, so,
of course, I get what's underneath it.

1230
02:24:44.052 --> 02:24:47.263
But there are no derricks there.

1231
02:24:47.346 --> 02:24:49.766
This is the Bandy tract.
Do you understand?

1232
02:24:49.849 --> 02:24:51.851
Do you understand, Eli?

1233
02:24:52.560 --> 02:24:55.813
That's more to the point.
Do you understand?

1234
02:24:55.897 --> 02:25:01.319
I drink your water.
I drink it up every day.

1235
02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:06.574
I drink the blood of Lamb
from Bandy's tract.

1236
02:25:11.829 --> 02:25:13.956
You can sit down again.

1237
02:25:32.058 --> 02:25:33.476
Daniel.

1238
02:25:36.687 --> 02:25:37.730
Daniel.

1239
02:25:41.567 --> 02:25:42.902
Please.

1240
02:25:45.530 --> 02:25:49.867
- I am in desperate times.
- I know.

1241
02:25:49.951 --> 02:25:52.829
- I need a friend.
- Yes. Of course, you do.

1242
02:25:53.204 --> 02:25:54.831
I've sinned.

1243
02:25:56.541 --> 02:25:59.710
I need help. I'm a sinner.

1244
02:25:59.794 --> 02:26:04.423
I've let the devil grab hold of me
in ways I never imagined.

1245
02:26:04.507 --> 02:26:05.967
I'm so full of sin.

1246
02:26:06.050 --> 02:26:09.345
The Lord sometimes challenges us,
doesn't He, Eli?

1247
02:26:09.428 --> 02:26:11.430
- Yes, He does, Daniel.
- Yes, He does.

1248
02:26:11.514 --> 02:26:14.142
Yes, He does!

1249
02:26:14.225 --> 02:26:16.185
Yes, He does!

1250
02:26:17.436 --> 02:26:23.025
He's completely failed to alert me
to the recent panic in our economy.

1251
02:26:23.109 --> 02:26:25.319
- And this...
- Oh, dear.

1252
02:26:25.403 --> 02:26:32.118
I must have this, Daniel.
I must, I must, I must have this.

1253
02:26:32.243 --> 02:26:34.495
My investments have...

1254
02:26:34.579 --> 02:26:39.667
Daniel, I won't bore you, but if I could
grab the Lord's hand for help I would,

1255
02:26:39.750 --> 02:26:42.670
but He does these things all the time.

1256
02:26:42.753 --> 02:26:46.757
These mysteries that He presents,
and while we wait...

1257
02:26:48.009 --> 02:26:50.219
While we wait for His word!

1258
02:26:50.303 --> 02:26:53.306
Because you're not
the chosen brother, Eli.

1259
02:26:55.683 --> 02:26:59.520
'Twas Paul who was chosen.

1260
02:27:00.354 --> 02:27:03.316
He found me and told me
about your land. You're just a fool.

1261
02:27:03.441 --> 02:27:06.277
- Why are you talking about Paul?
- I did what your brother couldn't.

1262
02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:08.946
- Don't say this to me.
- I broke you and I beat you.

1263
02:27:09.780 --> 02:27:12.617
It was Paul told me about you.

1264
02:27:12.742 --> 02:27:17.205
He's the prophet. He's the smart one.
He knew what was there

1265
02:27:17.288 --> 02:27:19.707
and he found me to take it
out of the ground.

1266
02:27:19.790 --> 02:27:22.919
Know what the funny thing is?
Listen, listen.

1267
02:27:23.753 --> 02:27:27.673
I paid him $10,000 cash in hand.
Just like that.

1268
02:27:28.674 --> 02:27:32.053
He has his own company now.
Prosperous little business.

1269
02:27:32.136 --> 02:27:35.681
Three wells producing, $5,000 a week.

1270
02:27:37.725 --> 02:27:41.562
Stop crying, you sniveling ass.
Stop your nonsense.

1271
02:27:42.730 --> 02:27:46.609
- You're just the afterbirth, Eli.
- No.

1272
02:27:46.692 --> 02:27:49.362
That slithered out on your mother's filth.

1273
02:27:49.487 --> 02:27:50.821
No.

1274
02:27:50.905 --> 02:27:55.159
They should've put you in a glass jar
on the mantelpiece.

1275
02:27:56.827 --> 02:28:00.206
Where were you when Paul
was suckling at his mother's teat?

1276
02:28:00.331 --> 02:28:01.832
Where were you?

1277
02:28:01.958 --> 02:28:06.671
Who was nursing you, poor Eli?
One of Bandy's sows?

1278
02:28:06.796 --> 02:28:09.715
That land has been had.
Nothing you can do about it. It's gone.

1279
02:28:09.799 --> 02:28:12.009
- If you would just take this lease...
- You lose.

1280
02:28:12.093 --> 02:28:15.346
Drainage!

1281
02:28:16.347 --> 02:28:19.976
Drainage, Eli, you boy.

1282
02:28:21.060 --> 02:28:24.021
Drained dry. I'm so sorry.

1283
02:28:25.189 --> 02:28:27.358
If you have a milkshake

1284
02:28:28.401 --> 02:28:30.194
and I have a milkshake,

1285
02:28:30.278 --> 02:28:33.489
and I have a straw, there it is.
That's the straw, you see?

1286
02:28:33.572 --> 02:28:35.199
Watch it.

1287
02:28:36.575 --> 02:28:43.541
Now my straw reaches across the room

1288
02:28:44.792 --> 02:28:47.628
and starts to drink your milkshake.

1289
02:28:48.546 --> 02:28:52.383
I drink your milkshake!

1290
02:28:54.552 --> 02:28:58.055
- I drink it up!
- Don't bully me, Daniel.

1291
02:29:00.725 --> 02:29:05.980
Did you think your song and dance and
your superstition would help you, Eli?

1292
02:29:06.063 --> 02:29:10.735
I am the Third Revelation.
I am who the Lord has chosen.

1293
02:29:12.903 --> 02:29:15.239
- Daniel!
- Because I'm smarter than you!

1294
02:29:15.323 --> 02:29:16.824
I'm older!

1295
02:29:17.616 --> 02:29:19.452
I'm your old friend, Daniel!

1296
02:29:19.535 --> 02:29:21.996
- I'm not a false prophet...
- Help me! Help me!

1297
02:29:22.079 --> 02:29:24.332
...you sniveling boy!

1298
02:29:24.415 --> 02:29:31.130
I am the Third Revelation!
I am the Third Revelation!

1299
02:29:31.213 --> 02:29:34.216
- I told you I would eat you.
- We're family!

1300
02:29:34.300 --> 02:29:38.763
- I told you I would eat you up!
- We're brothers! We're brothers!

1301
02:29:45.853 --> 02:29:48.689
Daniel, please forgive me. I beg you.

1302
02:29:52.318 --> 02:29:54.445
That's it. That's it.

1303
02:30:56.799 --> 02:30:58.300
Mr. Daniel?

1304
02:31:06.183 --> 02:31:07.893
I'm finished.
