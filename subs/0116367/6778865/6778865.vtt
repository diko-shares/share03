6
00:01:17.614 --> 00:01:19.930
- Hey, Earl.
- Yes, sir.

7
00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:22.308
- What do you know?
- Well...

8
00:01:25.163 --> 00:01:28.017
It's a hot goddamn day.

9
00:01:29.334 --> 00:01:31.236
I haven't felt it a bit.

10
00:01:31.336 --> 00:01:34.396
Been inside with the air conditioner
blasting all day long.

11
00:01:34.505 --> 00:01:37.069
- Oh, is that right?
- That's right.

12
00:01:42.138 --> 00:01:44.371
Didn't you break for lunch or nothin'?

13
00:01:44.432 --> 00:01:47.203
All by myself today.
Ate my lunch out of the microwave.

14
00:01:49.395 --> 00:01:51.959
Jesus H. Christ, Pete.

15
00:01:52.065 --> 00:01:56.200
When you gonna learn that microwave food
will kill you faster than a bullet?

16
00:01:56.277 --> 00:01:59.379
I mean, them damn burritos
ain't good for nothin' but a hippie.

17
00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:01.556
When he's high on weed.

18
00:02:03.076 --> 00:02:06.218
- Pull me down a bottle of that Jack, will ya?
- Yeah.

19
00:02:07.747 --> 00:02:10.518
I think I'm gonna get tanked tonight.

20
00:02:14.754 --> 00:02:17.194
What's the matter?

21
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.453
Yep.

22
00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:24.481
It's been one long, goddamn,
hot, miserable, shit-ass, fuckin' day,

23
00:02:24.597 --> 00:02:27.161
every inch of the way.

24
00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:31.196
First off. Nadine over at Blue Chip
got sort of sick.

25
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.035
So she got that goddamn,
Mongoloid boy of hers workin' the grill.

26
00:02:35.108 --> 00:02:38.914
I mean, that fuckin' idiot
doesn't know rat shit from Rice Krispies.

27
00:02:40.071 --> 00:02:41.932
They eat breakfast about 9:00.

28
00:02:42.031 --> 00:02:44.844
And I'm pukin' up pigs in a blanket,

29
00:02:44.951 --> 00:02:47.722
like a sick, fuckin' dog by 10:30.

30
00:02:47.787 --> 00:02:52.586
Isn't there a law or something
against retards serving food to the public?

31
00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.355
Well... If there ain't, there oughta be.

32
00:02:55.461 --> 00:02:57.446
I mean, who in the hell knows
what's goin' on

33
00:02:57.505 --> 00:02:58.787
in the mind of a goddamn Mongoloid?

34
00:02:58.881 --> 00:03:03.184
Nadine should've hit that boy
in the head and sold the fuckin' milk.

35
00:03:03.302 --> 00:03:05.784
You could sue the shit out of her,
you know that?

36
00:03:05.888 --> 00:03:08.618
That kid belongs under a circus tent,
not flippin' burgers.

37
00:03:08.683 --> 00:03:12.778
- You could own that fuckin' place.
- Oh, shit, Pete.

38
00:03:12.895 --> 00:03:15.419
What would I do with that grease pit?

39
00:03:15.481 --> 00:03:19.493
Besides, Nadine's got a cross to bear.

40
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.003
I mean, taking care of that potato head.

41
00:03:26.701 --> 00:03:31.417
I guess you heard about that shit
up in Abilene? Bank robbery?

42
00:03:31.497 --> 00:03:33.772
That's all that's been on the box all day.

43
00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:37.018
They killed some people, didn't they?

44
00:03:37.128 --> 00:03:40.148
Yeah. Killed four Rangers,

45
00:03:41.466 --> 00:03:43.947
three cops,

46
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.905
one civilian.

47
00:03:47.013 --> 00:03:50.156
Took a lady bank teller, hostage with them.

48
00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:55.740
Supposed to be headed for the border,
which'd bring 'em right my way.

49
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.661
If I get my hands on them crazy, sick,
fuckin' bastards, it's payback time.

50
00:04:01.736 --> 00:04:06.452
I mean... Well, we'll get 'em.

51
00:04:10.536 --> 00:04:11.942
We'll get 'em.

52
00:04:12.038 --> 00:04:14.354
Oh, I don't doubt it.

53
00:04:14.457 --> 00:04:16.897
Well...

54
00:04:17.001 --> 00:04:19.647
I gotta drain my lizard.

55
00:04:19.712 --> 00:04:20.704
Mind if I use your commode?

56
00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:23.908
- Knock yourself out.
- Thank you.

57
00:04:24.008 --> 00:04:26.325
You're welcome.

58
00:04:35.394 --> 00:04:37.421
You think I'm fuckin' playin' with you,
asshole?

59
00:04:37.522 --> 00:04:41.037
Do you want this little girl to die?
Or that little girl? Or yourself?

60
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.460
Or your bosom buddy with the badge?
Now, I don't wanna do it.

61
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.665
But I will turn this place into the fucking,
Wild Bunch if I think you are fuckin' with me.

62
00:04:48.741 --> 00:04:50.271
What do you want from me?
I did what you said.

63
00:04:50.368 --> 00:04:52.270
You let him use the bathroom.

64
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.975
- No store does that.
- He comes in here everyday and we bullshit.

65
00:04:55.081 --> 00:04:56.942
He's used my toilet a thousand times.
If I told him no,

66
00:04:57.041 --> 00:04:59.274
- he'd know something was up.
- All right, I want him out of here,

67
00:04:59.377 --> 00:05:03.141
in his car and down the road
or you can change the name of this place

68
00:05:03.256 --> 00:05:05.655
to Benny's World of Blood.

69
00:05:14.767 --> 00:05:18.738
- Were you giving that pig signals?
- Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!

70
00:05:22.316 --> 00:05:24.715
- He says you were scratching.
- I wasn't scratchin'!

71
00:05:24.777 --> 00:05:27.590
- Are you callin' him a liar?
- I'm not callin' him a liar, okay?

72
00:05:27.697 --> 00:05:29.930
I'm simply saying, if I was scratchin',
I don't remember scratchin'.

73
00:05:29.991 --> 00:05:31.521
And If I did scratch,
it's not because I was signaling.

74
00:05:31.617 --> 00:05:32.858
It's because I'm fuckin' scared shitless!

75
00:05:34.036 --> 00:05:36.311
Wait a minute.
The guy's in the bathroom.

76
00:05:36.414 --> 00:05:38.440
Why don't I just go back there,
shoot him in the back of the head

77
00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:40.319
- and we can get the hell outta here.
- Don't do that.

78
00:05:40.418 --> 00:05:42.899
Look. You asked me to act natural
and I acted natural.

79
00:05:42.962 --> 00:05:44.286
Under the circumstances, I think I oughta get

80
00:05:44.338 --> 00:05:46.075
a fuckin' Academy Award
for how natural I'm actin'.

81
00:05:46.132 --> 00:05:48.862
You asked me to get rid of him.
I'm doin' my best!

82
00:05:50.136 --> 00:05:53.445
Well, your best better get
a hell of a lot fuckin' better

83
00:05:53.556 --> 00:05:56.740
or you are gonna feel
a hell of a lot fuckin' worse.

84
00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.004
Everybody, be cool. You... Be cool.

85
00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:19.464
Yep. Be back at it tomorrow.

86
00:06:19.582 --> 00:06:22.808
Tonight I'm gonna sit in front of that box
and get higher than a Georgia pine.

87
00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:25.905
How much you want for that hooch, Pete?

88
00:06:26.005 --> 00:06:28.776
Oh, $6.50.

89
00:06:28.841 --> 00:06:30.494
Jesus Christ.

90
00:06:30.593 --> 00:06:32.826
- You buckin' for early retirement?
- Shit, yeah.

91
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.167
Hey! Hey!

92
00:06:38.267 --> 00:06:40.955
- What the fuck is that about?
- He signaled the Ranger.

93
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.626
I didn't! Ya gotta believe me! I didn't!

94
00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:46.129
When they were talking,
he mouthed the words, "Help us."

95
00:06:46.192 --> 00:06:48.922
- You fuckin' liar! I didn't say shit!
- Oh, just shut the hell up!

96
00:06:50.071 --> 00:06:53.297
Hey! You stop it!
What the fuck is your problem?

97
00:06:53.366 --> 00:06:57.005
- Goddamn it.
- Seth, he did it!

98
00:06:57.119 --> 00:06:59.353
You were by the beer cooler
with your back turned.

99
00:06:59.413 --> 00:07:01.853
I was by the magazines. I could see his face!

100
00:07:01.916 --> 00:07:05.226
And I saw him mouth the words, "Help us."

101
00:07:06.462 --> 00:07:09.026
Start the car.

102
00:07:09.131 --> 00:07:12.192
- You believe me, don't you?
- Yes. Shut up and start the car, all right.

103
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.334
- Start the car.
- You believe me?

104
00:07:13.386 --> 00:07:16.695
Start the car. You know that?
Shut the fuck up and start the car.

105
00:07:16.764 --> 00:07:19.204
- Wait a minute.
- I believe you. Start the car!

106
00:07:19.267 --> 00:07:20.879
You're not just saying that?

107
00:07:20.935 --> 00:07:22.630
- You do believe me?
- I believe you! Let's go!

108
00:07:22.728 --> 00:07:24.796
- That means you believe me.
- Yes, I believe you!

109
00:07:24.897 --> 00:07:27.627
You should, because I'm right.

110
00:07:39.578 --> 00:07:41.728
- Richie!
- Yeah?

111
00:07:42.873 --> 00:07:47.134
- You okay?
- He shot me in the fucking hand!

112
00:07:47.253 --> 00:07:51.803
- Like I told you he said "Help us."
- I never said, "Help us"!

113
00:07:51.924 --> 00:07:55.234
Well, that doesn't matter now, because you
got about two fuckin' seconds to live!

114
00:07:57.972 --> 00:07:59.957
- Richie?
- Yeah?

115
00:08:00.057 --> 00:08:03.118
When I count to three,
you shoot the bottles out from behind him.

116
00:08:03.227 --> 00:08:05.584
Oh, yeah!

117
00:08:05.646 --> 00:08:08.997
- One...
- Fuck!

118
00:08:09.108 --> 00:08:10.596
Two...

119
00:08:14.113 --> 00:08:15.519
Three!

120
00:09:08.834 --> 00:09:10.778
What did I tell you?
What did I say to you?

121
00:09:10.836 --> 00:09:12.615
I said, "Buy the roadmap and leave."

122
00:09:12.671 --> 00:09:14.160
What the fuck am I supposed to do, Seth?

123
00:09:14.215 --> 00:09:16.365
- He recognized us.
- He didn't recognize shit.

124
00:09:16.467 --> 00:09:18.494
Seth, I'm telling you,
the way he looked at us.

125
00:09:18.552 --> 00:09:21.158
You, especially, I knew he knew.

126
00:09:21.263 --> 00:09:25.317
Low profile! Do you understand
the meaning of the words "low profile"?

127
00:09:25.393 --> 00:09:28.081
"Hey, Richie, how's your hand?"
"It hurts like a fuckin' son of a bitch!

128
00:09:28.187 --> 00:09:30.668
- "Thanks for asking."
- Let me tell you what "low profile" is not.

129
00:09:30.773 --> 00:09:34.992
It is not taking girls hostage.
It is not shooting police.

130
00:09:35.069 --> 00:09:39.868
- It is not setting fire to a building.
- Bitch, bitch, bitch.

- What are you gonna do with me?
- I said "plant yourself." Plants don't talk.

156

Now, you wanna get on my good side?
You sit still and you don't make a peep.

- It's wrapped too tight. Nice and easy.
- Okay.

160
00:13:34.683 --> 00:13:36.916
All right. Okay, I'm gonna go get the money.

161
00:13:57.206 --> 00:14:01.259
It's 6:00.
What time's it get dark around here?

162
00:14:01.335 --> 00:14:02.906
- About 8:00.
- Good.

163
00:14:02.961 --> 00:14:05.608
I'm goin' to the border, check things out.
I'm gonna call Carlos,

00:14:05.714 --> 00:14:08.196
try and arrange some sort of a rendezvous.
I don't know what.

165
00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.658
Could you see if he could arrange
a better deal than 30%?

166
00:14:10.761 --> 00:14:12.870
It's their standard deal.
They're not gonna change that for us.

167
00:14:12.971 --> 00:14:15.618
- Did you even try and negotiate with them?
- Richie.

168
00:14:15.724 --> 00:14:19.571
These guys are not spic firecracker salesmen
from Tijuana.

169
00:14:19.645 --> 00:14:22.291
They don't even know the meaning
of the word "barter."

170
00:14:22.356 --> 00:14:26.741
You wanna stay in El Rey, you give them
30% of your loot. It's scripture.

171
00:14:26.819 --> 00:14:29.921
So it is written, so shall it be done.
Yeah, I know, listen.

172
00:14:29.988 --> 00:14:34.952
Hey, you want sanctuary,
you gotta pay the price. The price is 30%.

173
00:14:35.077 --> 00:14:37.641
- All I'm saying, man...
- This conversation's over.

174
00:14:39.581 --> 00:14:41.112
Okay?

175
00:14:44.837 --> 00:14:46.490
We need to have a talk.

176
00:14:47.297 --> 00:14:49.489
- What's your name?
- Gloria.

177
00:14:49.591 --> 00:14:51.659
Hello, Gloria. I'm Seth.
That's my brother Richie.

178
00:14:51.719 --> 00:14:53.539
Let's cut to the chase.

179
00:14:53.637 --> 00:14:57.029
I'm gonna ask you one question
and all I want is a yes or no answer.

180
00:14:58.016 --> 00:15:00.830
Do you wanna live through this?

181
00:15:00.894 --> 00:15:02.673
- Yes.
- Good.

182
00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:07.032
Rule number one. No noise. No questions.

183
00:15:07.151 --> 00:15:12.652
If you make a noise, Mr. 44 makes a noise.

184
00:15:12.781 --> 00:15:16.173
If you ask a question, Mr. 44 answers it.

185
00:15:16.243 --> 00:15:20.793
Now are you absolutely,
positively clear about rule number one?

186
00:15:22.291 --> 00:15:24.855
- Yes.
- Rule number two.

187
00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.110
You do what we say, when we say it.

188
00:15:27.212 --> 00:15:29.859
If you don't, see rule number one.

189
00:15:30.841 --> 00:15:35.226
Rule number three.
Don't you ever try and fucking run on us,

190
00:15:35.345 --> 00:15:41.302
'cause I got six little friends
and they can all run faster than you can.

191
00:15:43.061 --> 00:15:44.468
Open your eyes.

192
00:15:46.982 --> 00:15:50.332
Gloria, you hang in there,
you follow the rules.

193
00:15:50.402 --> 00:15:53.794
And you don't fuck with us
and you'll get out of this alive.

194
00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.971
- I give you my word.
- Okay.

195
00:16:05.626 --> 00:16:07.362
I'll be back in a minute.

196
00:16:22.267 --> 00:16:24.914
You wanna come over on the bed
and watch TV with me?

197
00:16:44.373 --> 00:16:46.026
<i>Hail!</i>

198
00:16:46.124 --> 00:16:47.489
Come on.

199
00:16:59.471 --> 00:17:01.084
Have a seat.

200
00:17:09.481 --> 00:17:10.887
Take off your shoes.

201
00:17:27.499 --> 00:17:31.014
You got about two more hours

202
00:17:31.128 --> 00:17:34.230
until we get into El Paso...

203
00:17:34.339 --> 00:17:36.986
which is right next to the border.

204
00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:38.871
Then we'll stop at a motel.

205
00:17:38.969 --> 00:17:39.961
Stop?

206
00:17:40.012 --> 00:17:42.328
We're not actually gonna
stop at a motel, are we?

207
00:17:42.431 --> 00:17:45.244
Yeah, what for? We have a motor home.

208
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:49.073
We don't wanna stay in
those roach-haven motels, do we?

209
00:17:49.187 --> 00:17:50.924
- We're self-contained.
- We're self-contained.

210
00:17:51.023 --> 00:17:52.511
Okay, okay.

211
00:17:52.566 --> 00:17:56.992
Maybe I was a little overzealous.
But give me a break, I just bought it.

212
00:17:57.112 --> 00:18:00.918
- How come you wanna stop anyways, Dad?
- I'm exhausted.

213
00:18:01.033 --> 00:18:05.086
Exhausted? Just lie in the back, Dad.
I can drive us into Mexico.

214
00:18:05.203 --> 00:18:08.513
I just bet you would.
Don't even think about it.

215
00:18:08.582 --> 00:18:11.808
Besides, I wanna have...

216
00:18:11.877 --> 00:18:14.897
just one night's sleep
in an honest to goodness bed.

217
00:18:15.005 --> 00:18:19.058
The beds in the home are okay, but...

218
00:18:19.176 --> 00:18:22.195
They're not like a real bed.

219
00:18:22.304 --> 00:18:25.075
Excuse me.
I have to use the restroom.

220
00:18:35.567 --> 00:18:39.332
Oh, guess what? When I called
the machine to check the messages,

221
00:18:40.238 --> 00:18:42.802
one of them was from Bethel Baptist.

222
00:18:42.908 --> 00:18:45.348
And Mr. Franklin said that

223
00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:49.505
he wouldn't permanently replace you
until we came back.

224
00:18:49.581 --> 00:18:52.891
- And he said that...
- That's very nice of Ted.

225
00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.020
But I'll call him tomorrow
and tell him not to bother waiting.

226
00:19:02.302 --> 00:19:08.342
Daddy, I didn't wanna talk about this
in front of Scott because he gets upset.

227
00:19:09.267 --> 00:19:10.963
But I just wanna know.

228
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.710
Don't you believe in God anymore?

229
00:19:16.274 --> 00:19:18.963
Not enough to be a pastor.

230
00:19:20.112 --> 00:19:24.414
Look, I know this is hard on you kids.

231
00:19:24.491 --> 00:19:28.380
But after Jenny's death, this is
probably the last thing you need,

232
00:19:28.453 --> 00:19:33.127
but my congregation
needs spiritual leadership.

233
00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:36.310
Well... My faith is gone.

234
00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:41.548
To answer your question.
Yes, I do believe in Jesus.

235
00:19:41.633 --> 00:19:45.604
Yes, I do believe in God.

236
00:19:45.679 --> 00:19:48.989
But do I love them?

237
00:19:49.099 --> 00:19:51.126
No.

238
00:19:51.226 --> 00:19:55.694
Well, it's just
that all our lives, you've been a pastor.

239
00:19:55.814 --> 00:20:00.902
And then, one day you're just
gonna wake up and say, "Fuck him"?

240
00:20:02.487 --> 00:20:04.431
I didn't say, "Fuck him."

241
00:20:06.867 --> 00:20:09.638
Every person who

242
00:20:09.745 --> 00:20:14.957
chooses the service of God as his
life's work has something in common.

243
00:20:15.083 --> 00:20:18.020
I don't care
if you're a preacher, a priest,

244
00:20:18.128 --> 00:20:20.982
a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk.

245
00:20:21.048 --> 00:20:26.508
Many, many times during your life,
you'll look at your reflection in the mirror

246
00:20:26.636 --> 00:20:28.828
and ask yourself,

247
00:20:28.889 --> 00:20:31.991
"Am I a fool?"

248
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.830
I'm not going through a lapse.

249
00:20:34.895 --> 00:20:38.493
What I've experienced
is closer to awakening.

250
00:20:39.858 --> 00:20:42.794
But Daddy,

251
00:20:42.861 --> 00:20:45.384
what do you think Mom would say?

252
00:20:45.489 --> 00:20:49.874
Mama's got nothin' to say.
She's dead.

253
00:20:52.204 --> 00:20:55.843
<i>This bloody crime spree
started just a week ago today.</i>

254
00:20:55.957 --> 00:20:58.894
<i>The oldest of the two brothers, Seth Gecko,</i>

255
00:20:59.002 --> 00:21:02.517
<i>was serving time in Rolling's,
Kansas State Penitentiary</i>

256
00:21:02.589 --> 00:21:06.104
<i>for his part in the 1988
Scott City bank robbery</i>

257
00:21:06.218 --> 00:21:09.196
<i>in which two law enforcement
officers lost their lives.</i>

258
00:21:09.304 --> 00:21:14.350
<i>It was while at the courthouse that this man,
his younger brother, Richard Gecko,</i>

259
00:21:14.476 --> 00:21:19.522
<i>a known armed robber and sex offender
pulled off a daring daylight escape,</i>

260
00:21:19.648 --> 00:21:24.902
<i>resulting in the death of four Wichita
law enforcement officers and this woman,</i>

261
00:21:25.028 --> 00:21:28.585
<i>Heidi Vogel, sixth grade teacher,
who was run over by the Geckos</i>

262
00:21:28.698 --> 00:21:31.676
<i>during a high-speed pursuit
through downtown Wichita.</i>

263
00:21:31.743 --> 00:21:35.921
<i>And earlier today, during a daylight
liquor store robbery in Big Springs,</i>

264
00:21:36.039 --> 00:21:39.886
<i>the Gecko brothers killed
another Texas Ranger,</i>

265
00:21:40.001 --> 00:21:43.228
<i>Earl McGraw and liquor store clerk,
Pete Bottoms.</i>

266
00:21:43.338 --> 00:21:46.316
{\an8}<i>That changes the death toll to 16.</i>

267
00:21:46.424 --> 00:21:50.644
{\an8}<i>Five Texas Rangers,
eight police officers, three civilians</i>

268
00:21:50.762 --> 00:21:54.857
{\an8}<i>and one hostage,
bank teller and mother of four, Gloria Hill.</i>

269
00:21:54.933 --> 00:21:58.076
<i>For the time being, we're very confident
that we'll apprehend these fugitives</i>

270
00:21:58.186 --> 00:22:00.089
<i>within the next 48 hours.</i>

271
00:22:00.188 --> 00:22:03.208
<i>The Bureau, local law enforcement
and the Texas Rangers</i>

272
00:22:03.275 --> 00:22:08.074
<i>have all joined in forming a dragnet
to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.</i>

273
00:22:08.155 --> 00:22:11.091
<i>Is it safe to assume that because of
the death count involved</i>

274
00:22:11.199 --> 00:22:14.342
<i>and the loss of life
of law enforcement officers,</i>

275
00:22:14.452 --> 00:22:16.602
<i>that the Bureau, the Rangers
and the police force</i>

276
00:22:16.705 --> 00:22:19.269
<i>are taking this manhunt personally?</i>

277
00:22:19.374 --> 00:22:22.270
<i>I would say that's a very safe assumption.</i>

278
00:22:36.808 --> 00:22:39.621
Shit, I was really worried.
Where the fuck you been, man?

279
00:22:39.686 --> 00:22:42.374
- Sightseeing.
- What'd you see?

280
00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.637
The cops.

281
00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:46.172
- Did you see the border?
- Yes, I saw the border.

282
00:22:46.276 --> 00:22:47.806
What'd the TV say?

283
00:22:47.861 --> 00:22:51.376
They're gonna apprehend us
in about 48 hours.

284
00:22:51.489 --> 00:22:54.053
I gotta figure out a way
to get us across this goddamn border.

285
00:22:54.159 --> 00:22:59.371
The longer we stay here,
our lives ain't worth shit. Here you go.

286
00:22:59.497 --> 00:23:02.103
We gotta get our asses
into Mexico tonight.

287
00:23:02.167 --> 00:23:05.559
Then Carlos is gonna meet us there
at the rendezvous tomorrow morning.

288
00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:10.966
He and his boys, all of them
are gonna escort us into El Rey.

289
00:23:11.092 --> 00:23:12.953
And...

290
00:23:15.555 --> 00:23:17.705
- Where's the woman?
- What?

291
00:23:17.807 --> 00:23:20.703
What do you mean, what? The woman.
The hostage, the fuckin' hostage.

292
00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:22.878
Richard, where is she?

293
00:23:24.522 --> 00:23:25.639
She's in there.

294
00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:28.875
- What the fuck is she doin' in there?
- Seth, wait a minute.

295
00:23:28.985 --> 00:23:30.888
Seth.

296
00:23:40.538 --> 00:23:44.220
Richard, what's wrong with you?

297
00:23:44.334 --> 00:23:45.408
Before you flip out, okay,

298
00:23:45.502 --> 00:23:49.141
- let me just explain what happened.
- Explain to me.

299
00:23:49.214 --> 00:23:53.350
I need an explanation.
What is the matter with you?

300
00:23:53.426 --> 00:23:55.370
There's nothing wrong with me, Brother.

301
00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:57.497
That woman tried to escape
and I did what I had to.

302
00:23:57.555 --> 00:24:00.369
No, the woman wouldn't have
said shit if she had a mouth full of it.

303
00:24:00.433 --> 00:24:02.625
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

304
00:24:02.727 --> 00:24:04.630
- Yeah.
- After you left,

305
00:24:04.729 --> 00:24:08.659
- she became a completely different person.
- Yeah.

306
00:24:10.235 --> 00:24:14.454
Is it me? Is it my fault?

307
00:24:14.572 --> 00:24:16.889
- It's not your fault.
- Is this my fault?

308
00:24:16.992 --> 00:24:20.218
- No, it's her fault. It's not your fault.
- Is this my fault?

309
00:24:20.287 --> 00:24:24.009
- Do you think that this is what I am?
- I don't.

310
00:24:24.082 --> 00:24:27.681
This is not me.
I am a professional fucking thief.

311
00:24:27.752 --> 00:24:32.220
I don't kill people that I don't have to
and I don't fucking rape women.

312
00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:35.401
What you are doing...
What you are fucking doing...

313
00:24:35.468 --> 00:24:39.771
What you are doing is not how it's done.
Do you understand that? Do you?

314
00:24:39.889 --> 00:24:43.778
Just say, "Fucking yes."
Say, "Yes, Seth, I understand."

315
00:24:43.893 --> 00:24:44.885
Yes, Seth, I understand.

316
00:24:44.936 --> 00:24:47.418
Say it. Say, "Yes, Seth,
I fucking understand!"

317
00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:50.707
I understand, Seth. I fucking understand.

318
00:24:56.114 --> 00:24:58.306
We'll get to Mexico and
it's gonna be sweet rosemary

319
00:24:58.408 --> 00:25:00.021
and a hundred proof liquor...

320
00:25:01.161 --> 00:25:04.345
...and rice and beans and none
of this shit's gonna matter.

321
00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.938
I can't believe he's stoppin' here.
This place is totally cruddy.

322
00:25:23.224 --> 00:25:26.120
Dad, why are we stoppin' here?

323
00:25:28.104 --> 00:25:31.247
There's nothin' wrong with this place.

324
00:25:31.316 --> 00:25:34.046
It's a flophouse.

325
00:25:34.152 --> 00:25:37.295
It's not a flophouse.

326
00:25:37.405 --> 00:25:40.135
It's basic and it's simple.

327
00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.178
That doesn't make it a flophouse.

328
00:25:43.286 --> 00:25:46.058
All right. Well, if it doesn't have a pool,

329
00:25:46.164 --> 00:25:48.935
then we're goin' some place else.

330
00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:52.153
It has a bed.

331
00:25:52.253 --> 00:25:55.107
That's all I care about.

332
00:25:55.173 --> 00:25:57.654
Well, other places have beds, too,

333
00:25:57.759 --> 00:26:00.695
and they also have a gym...

334
00:26:09.229 --> 00:26:12.744
Geez, what is this guy's problem?

335
00:26:12.857 --> 00:26:15.215
No idea.

336
00:26:19.531 --> 00:26:22.095
Creepy guy.

337
00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:37.832
What?

338
00:26:37.882 --> 00:26:41.771
Yes, I'm your neighbor
from room 11

339
00:26:41.886 --> 00:26:45.857
and I hate to disturb you,
but I'd like to ask a favor.

340
00:26:53.648 --> 00:26:56.047
I hope none of this is disturbin' you.

341
00:27:04.075 --> 00:27:06.018
Hi. I'm from room 11.

342
00:27:06.077 --> 00:27:10.006
And me and my lady friend need some ice
and we don't seem to have an ice bucket.

343
00:27:10.081 --> 00:27:15.045
If it's not too much trouble, could I possibly
borrow yours? I'll bring it right back.

344
00:27:18.256 --> 00:27:20.159
- Sure.
- Thank you.

345
00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.674
What is this?

346
00:27:30.852 --> 00:27:32.505
It's called a punch.

347
00:27:33.104 --> 00:27:34.634
Lose the guitar.

348
00:27:38.109 --> 00:27:39.762
What's your name?

349
00:27:39.861 --> 00:27:41.928
- Jacob.
- Jacob, get up. Get on the bed.

350
00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:45.422
If you make a wrong move,
I will shoot you in the face.

351
00:27:45.492 --> 00:27:46.525
Open your mouth.

352
00:27:46.618 --> 00:27:47.816
Wide!

353
00:27:49.954 --> 00:27:52.436
Let's go.
Let's move the Jap over here, too. Let's go.

354
00:28:01.216 --> 00:28:04.690
So what's the story with you two?
You a couple of fags?

355
00:28:04.802 --> 00:28:05.959
He's my son.

356
00:28:06.054 --> 00:28:08.411
How's that happened?
You don't look Japanese.

357
00:28:08.473 --> 00:28:11.988
Neither does he. He looks Chinese.

358
00:28:12.644 --> 00:28:15.290
Oh, ooh, well, excuse me all to hell.

359
00:28:17.273 --> 00:28:20.583
- What's this about, money?
- It's about money, all right, but not yours.

360
00:28:20.652 --> 00:28:24.250
My brother and I, we're in a little hot water
and we need your assistance.

361
00:28:26.407 --> 00:28:27.399
Stop!

362
00:28:28.326 --> 00:28:30.972
What's goin' on?

363
00:28:31.079 --> 00:28:34.388
We're having a bikini contest
and you just won.

364
00:28:34.499 --> 00:28:37.353
It's okay, honey.
Everything's gonna be all right.

365
00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:40.356
Just listen to your daddy, sugar,
and you don't do anything stupid.

366
00:28:40.463 --> 00:28:43.151
You two, Simon says,
sit the fuck down.

367
00:28:43.258 --> 00:28:44.994
Sit down.

368
00:28:47.845 --> 00:28:50.534
Now, where are the keys
to the motor home?

369
00:28:51.015 --> 00:28:53.703
- On the dresser.
- Good. All right.

370
00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:58.567
Richie, you take these keys, you start
this big bastard up and drive it up front.

371
00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:07.365
Richie, would you do me a favor
and eat my pussy for me? Please?

372
00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:11.833
- Sure.
- Richie, hey!

373
00:29:11.953 --> 00:29:14.062
Not when you get around to it. Now.

374
00:29:26.217 --> 00:29:29.898
You, Gidget, go in the bathroom
and put on some clothes.

375
00:29:32.015 --> 00:29:35.157
You got three minutes. One second longer,
I shoot your father in the face.

376
00:29:35.226 --> 00:29:37.376
- Do you understand what I just said?
- Yes.

377
00:29:37.478 --> 00:29:38.967
- Do you believe me?
- Yes.

378
00:29:39.063 --> 00:29:41.710
You damn well better. Go.

379
00:29:56.914 --> 00:29:59.272
Look, if you want the motor home,

380
00:29:59.375 --> 00:30:01.360
just take it and get out.

381
00:30:01.419 --> 00:30:05.886
It's not gonna be that easy, Pops.
We're gonna go on a little ride.

382
00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.037
Not a chance.

383
00:30:12.847 --> 00:30:16.528
- Come again?
- If you're takin' people, take me.

384
00:30:19.354 --> 00:30:22.746
But my kids aren't going
anywhere with you.

385
00:30:22.815 --> 00:30:25.545
Sorry, Pops. I need everybody.

386
00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:28.919
My children are not goin' with you
and that's that.

387
00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:33.497
That's not fucking that.
This is fucking this.

388
00:30:33.618 --> 00:30:35.189
Dad.

389
00:30:36.788 --> 00:30:39.227
You sit down. Sit down.

390
00:30:40.667 --> 00:30:42.941
You, go sit over there.
Go sit over there, now. Move it.

391
00:30:43.002 --> 00:30:44.781
Sit down.

392
00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:51.986
Now, I don't have time to fuck around,
so I'm gonna make this simple.

393
00:30:52.095 --> 00:30:54.576
You take your kids
and you get in that motor home

394
00:30:54.639 --> 00:30:57.534
or I will execute
all three of you right now.

395
00:31:00.228 --> 00:31:03.330
So, what's it gonna be?

396
00:31:03.439 --> 00:31:05.507
Yes or no, answer.

397
00:31:06.818 --> 00:31:08.306
Yes.

398
00:31:08.361 --> 00:31:10.925
Hey, your old man's all right.
He just saved your life.

399
00:31:13.449 --> 00:31:16.469
Time's up, princess. Here we go.

400
00:31:17.495 --> 00:31:20.141
Okay, ramblers, let's get rambling.

401
00:31:34.137 --> 00:31:35.501
Excuse me.

402
00:31:36.514 --> 00:31:37.878
What?

403
00:31:39.225 --> 00:31:43.154
- Where are you takin' us?
- Mexico.

404
00:31:43.229 --> 00:31:45.172
What's in Mexico?

405
00:31:46.023 --> 00:31:47.512
Mexicans.

406
00:31:49.485 --> 00:31:52.298
- Richie?
- Yeah?

407
00:31:53.614 --> 00:31:55.185
Put in your bit.

408
00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.528
I grind my teeth.

409
00:32:15.428 --> 00:32:17.455
What are their names?

410
00:32:17.555 --> 00:32:20.243
- Scott and Kate.
- Scott and Kate.

411
00:32:20.349 --> 00:32:22.499
Who's this?

412
00:32:24.645 --> 00:32:27.417
- My wife.
- Where is the little lady?

413
00:32:29.525 --> 00:32:33.703
- In heaven.
- She dead?

414
00:32:33.821 --> 00:32:35.434
Yes, she is.

415
00:32:35.531 --> 00:32:38.592
How'd she die?

416
00:32:38.701 --> 00:32:40.686
Auto wreck.

417
00:32:42.413 --> 00:32:44.108
Come on, Jacob.
Give me some more details.

418
00:32:44.207 --> 00:32:47.888
How'd it happen?
Some fucking drunk kill her?

419
00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:51.103
No. It was a rainy night.

420
00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:56.358
The brakes on the car weren't great.

421
00:32:56.427 --> 00:32:59.363
She had to stop suddenly.

422
00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:03.153
She slid on the road.
She crashed. She died.

423
00:33:03.267 --> 00:33:06.245
- She died right away?
- Not quite.

424
00:33:07.313 --> 00:33:11.491
She was trapped in the wreck
for about six hours

425
00:33:11.609 --> 00:33:14.297
before she passed on.

426
00:33:14.403 --> 00:33:19.699
Yep. Those acts of God really stick
it in and break it off, don't they?

427
00:33:19.784 --> 00:33:22.514
Yes, they do.

428
00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:25.101
Is that real?

429
00:33:25.164 --> 00:33:28.763
- Yes.
- I've seen one of these things before.

430
00:33:28.835 --> 00:33:32.599
A friend of mine had himself ordained,
a minister of his own religion.

431
00:33:32.672 --> 00:33:35.940
Some way to fuck the IRS.

432
00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:38.283
Is that what you're doing
or are you the real McCoy?

433
00:33:39.053 --> 00:33:41.080
The real McCoy?

434
00:33:42.431 --> 00:33:43.630
You're a preacher?

435
00:33:44.809 --> 00:33:46.752
I was a minister.

436
00:33:47.645 --> 00:33:49.962
"Was" as in not anymore?

437
00:33:50.022 --> 00:33:52.049
- Yes.
- Why'd you quit?

438
00:33:52.149 --> 00:33:53.638
I think I've gotten about

439
00:33:53.734 --> 00:33:56.795
as up close and personal with you
as I'm gonna get.

440
00:33:56.863 --> 00:34:01.744
Let's just keep this friendly, okay, Pops?
Let's not get too sensitive.

441
00:34:03.786 --> 00:34:08.171
You're right. Enough with
the gettin' to know you shit. All right.

442
00:34:08.291 --> 00:34:10.896
I don't give a rat's ass about you
or your fuckin' family.

443
00:34:11.002 --> 00:34:14.931
You can all live forever
or you can die this second.

444
00:34:15.006 --> 00:34:17.155
And I don't give a shit which.

445
00:34:17.216 --> 00:34:19.284
The only things that I care about are me,

446
00:34:19.343 --> 00:34:21.618
that son of a bitch back there in the back
and our money.

447
00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:25.112
So you help us get across the border
without incident.

448
00:34:25.182 --> 00:34:27.829
You stay with us through the night
without trying anything funny,

449
00:34:27.935 --> 00:34:29.796
without trying to escape.

450
00:34:29.854 --> 00:34:33.122
And in the morning,
I'm gonna let you guys go, all of you.

451
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:35.672
How do I know you'll keep your word?

452
00:34:35.735 --> 00:34:38.174
You have to convince me
you're tellin' the truth.

453
00:34:38.279 --> 00:34:41.092
Look, dickhead, the only thing
that you have to be convinced about

454
00:34:41.198 --> 00:34:45.501
is the fact that you are stuck in a situation
with a couple of real mean motor scooters.

455
00:34:45.578 --> 00:34:48.638
And I don't want to have
to worry about you all fuckin' night.

456
00:34:48.706 --> 00:34:51.642
You know, I don't think you wanna be
worrying about my brother's intentions

457
00:34:51.709 --> 00:34:54.894
towards your daughter all night, either.

458
00:34:55.004 --> 00:34:56.657
Did you notice the way
he was looking at her?

459
00:34:56.714 --> 00:34:57.748
Yes.

460
00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.743
- You didn't like it, did you?
- No, I didn't.

461
00:34:59.842 --> 00:35:02.862
I didn't think so. You get us into Mexico

462
00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:06.982
and you don't try to escape
and your daughter will be safe.

463
00:35:07.058 --> 00:35:11.069
And in the morning, I will let you go.
I give you my word, Jacob.

464
00:35:14.398 --> 00:35:17.873
If he touches her, I'll kill him!

465
00:35:17.944 --> 00:35:21.666
Fair enough.
You break your word, I'll kill all of ya.

00:36:21.966 --> 00:36:23.537
What?

476
00:36:26.303 --> 00:36:28.785
In the room?

477
00:36:28.889 --> 00:36:31.453
Did you mean what you said back there,
or were you just foolin' around?

478
00:36:31.559 --> 00:36:36.771
Because if you really want me to do that
for you, I will. I'd be happy to.

479
00:36:39.108 --> 00:36:43.120
- Do what?
- What you said back there in the room?

480
00:36:43.195 --> 00:36:45.429
What did I say?

481
00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:49.303
- You asked me if I would eat...
- Richie.

482
00:36:49.368 --> 00:36:50.360
What?

483
00:36:50.453 --> 00:36:53.224
I told you to watch those kids.
Not to talk to them.

484
00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:56.681
You don't have nothin' to say to one another.
So let's just cut the chatter.

485
00:36:59.378 --> 00:37:01.321
We'll talk later. Okay?

486
00:37:27.531 --> 00:37:29.185
All right, everybody.
It's show time.

487
00:37:29.283 --> 00:37:33.709
Richie, you take Kate into the bathroom.
Scott, get up here with your dad. Let's go.

488
00:37:35.998 --> 00:37:38.355
Now, what are you gonna say?

489
00:37:40.044 --> 00:37:42.029
I don't have the slightest idea.

490
00:37:42.088 --> 00:37:45.148
Just keep thinking about the gun
next to Kate's head.

491
00:37:47.051 --> 00:37:48.622
Get in.

492
00:37:58.562 --> 00:37:59.719
This isn't gonna work, Seth.

493
00:37:59.814 --> 00:38:02.709
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine.

494
00:38:03.901 --> 00:38:06.051
Hey, what are you gonna do?

495
00:38:07.113 --> 00:38:09.884
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.

496
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:12.886
Dad, you have to tell them
that they're back there.

497
00:38:12.993 --> 00:38:14.896
Have you forgotten about your sister?

498
00:38:15.329 --> 00:38:18.514
I want to go on record right now
as saying that this is a very bad idea.

499
00:38:18.582 --> 00:38:20.567
Duly noted. Now shut up.

500
00:38:21.794 --> 00:38:25.517
Oh, my God. Look over here.
Step right over there.

501
00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:29.982
They're gonna kill us, Dad.
They're gonna get us across the border,

502
00:38:30.094 --> 00:38:32.740
take us out in the desert,
then they're gonna fuckin' shoot us.

503
00:38:32.805 --> 00:38:35.245
If they get over the border,
they're gonna let us go.

504
00:38:35.307 --> 00:38:40.850
No, they won't. Dad, come on. I watch those
reality shows. They never let anybody go.

505
00:38:40.938 --> 00:38:44.744
Any cop'll tell you, in a situation like this,
you get a chance, you go for it.

506
00:38:44.859 --> 00:38:46.885
It may not seem like it,
but I know exactly what I'm doing.

507
00:38:46.944 --> 00:38:48.268
You're gonna have to trust me on this.

508
00:38:48.362 --> 00:38:50.141
I can't do that, Dad.

509
00:38:50.614 --> 00:38:52.723
If you don't tell the cops, I will.

510
00:38:52.783 --> 00:38:54.272
Now listen to me!

511
00:38:54.326 --> 00:38:57.056
You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing!
You hear me?

512
00:38:59.582 --> 00:39:01.691
I'm running the show!
I make the decisions!

513
00:39:01.792 --> 00:39:03.405
He is running the show.

514
00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:05.487
- I'm running the show! I'm running the show!
- Dad!

515
00:39:07.298 --> 00:39:09.614
Shh. I make the plays.

516
00:39:10.467 --> 00:39:11.542
You back the plays I make.

517
00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:15.124
I need your cover.

518
00:39:16.557 --> 00:39:17.549
Cover me.

519
00:39:23.439 --> 00:39:25.092
How many with you?

520
00:39:25.774 --> 00:39:26.931
Just my son and I.

521
00:39:28.485 --> 00:39:30.635
What's your purpose in Mexico?

522
00:39:30.738 --> 00:39:34.585
Vacation. I'm taking him
to see his first bullfight.

523
00:39:35.242 --> 00:39:36.648
They're gonna search the van.

524
00:39:36.702 --> 00:39:40.963
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut,
we're gonna be just fine.

525
00:39:41.582 --> 00:39:44.436
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

526
00:39:44.501 --> 00:39:46.693
- What?
- You just called me a fuckin' nut.

527
00:39:46.795 --> 00:39:48.863
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

528
00:39:48.964 --> 00:39:51.404
You said, "As long as
I don't act like a fucking nut"

529
00:39:51.508 --> 00:39:53.329
implying that I've been acting
like a fucking nut.

530
00:39:53.427 --> 00:39:55.494
Take a pill, all right.
I just meant be cool.

531
00:39:55.554 --> 00:39:57.539
Yeah, you meant that,
but you meant the other, too.

532
00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:00.079
This is not the time, Richie.

533
00:40:00.184 --> 00:40:04.610
Hey, fuck those spic pigs, man!
You called me a "fucking nut."

534
00:40:04.688 --> 00:40:06.673
Now, where I come from,
that stops the train in its tracks.

535
00:40:06.732 --> 00:40:08.675
Keep your fucking voice down.

536
00:40:08.734 --> 00:40:09.891
Or what?

537
00:40:11.862 --> 00:40:13.682
- What was that?
- Hmm?

538
00:40:15.199 --> 00:40:19.005
Oh! That was just...
Just my daughter in the bathroom.

539
00:40:19.828 --> 00:40:22.889
I thought you said
it was just you and your son?

540
00:40:23.958 --> 00:40:27.060
Um, I meant me and my son
and my daughter.

541
00:40:29.213 --> 00:40:31.240
Open up. I'm comin' aboard.

542
00:40:37.721 --> 00:40:41.320
What was the nuttiest thing I did, Seth?
I'm curious. Tell me. What was it?

543
00:40:41.392 --> 00:40:43.667
- This is not the time, Richie.
- I know.

544
00:40:43.727 --> 00:40:46.291
Was it possibly when your ass
was rotting in jail and I broke it out?

545
00:40:47.439 --> 00:40:50.211
That was nutty, huh?
Not to mention stupid.

546
00:40:54.738 --> 00:40:55.979
Thanks.

547
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:13.077
I'm in the bathroom.

548
00:41:13.173 --> 00:41:14.952
Open up. It's Border Patrol.

549
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:16.621
It's open.

550
00:41:21.265 --> 00:41:25.401
Do you mind?
Shut the fuckin' door, please!

551
00:41:27.146 --> 00:41:28.469
Excuse me.

552
00:41:41.285 --> 00:41:43.435
Goddamn, that was intense!

553
00:41:49.752 --> 00:41:51.778
Oh, baby, we did it. We're in Mexico.

554
00:41:51.837 --> 00:41:55.643
We're fuckin' in Mexico,
you little piece of fuckin' shit!

555
00:41:55.758 --> 00:41:57.784
Come on! Kate, get out here.

556
00:42:02.556 --> 00:42:04.623
All right, listen up.
Everybody, listen.

557
00:42:04.683 --> 00:42:06.462
Now I know that I put you all through hell,

558
00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.083
and I know that I have been
one rough pecker.

559
00:42:09.146 --> 00:42:12.910
But from here on out,
you guys are all in my cool book.

560
00:42:12.983 --> 00:42:16.168
Scotty, I want you to help me with Richie.
We'll lay him down on the couch over there.

561
00:42:16.278 --> 00:42:18.428
Jacob, you're gonna keep
driving down this street

562
00:42:18.489 --> 00:42:20.638
until you come to another street
called De Gallo.

563
00:42:20.741 --> 00:42:23.967
When you get to De Gallo,
you're gonna turn this big bastard left,

564
00:42:24.078 --> 00:42:27.759
and you're gonna go down a couple of miles
until you see a bar called the Titty Twister.

565
00:42:27.831 --> 00:42:29.568
From what I understand,
you cannot miss it.

566
00:42:29.666 --> 00:42:30.658
Then?

567
00:42:30.709 --> 00:42:33.977
And then you stop because
that's where we're going.

568
00:42:48.685 --> 00:42:50.670
Don't make a career out of this, okay?

569
00:42:50.771 --> 00:42:51.845
Come on, hey.

570
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:54.885
Hey, you okay?

571
00:42:57.027 --> 00:43:00.047
Yeah, I think so. What happened?

572
00:43:00.155 --> 00:43:02.472
I don't know. You just passed out.

573
00:43:02.533 --> 00:43:03.525
I did?

574
00:43:03.617 --> 00:43:05.560
Mmm-hmm. You said something
about your hand hurtin'

575
00:43:05.661 --> 00:43:07.232
and then you just hit the ground
like a sack of potatoes.

576
00:43:08.372 --> 00:43:09.984
Really?

577
00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.812
Head hit the toilet.
You scared the shit out of me.

578
00:43:12.876 --> 00:43:14.944
You sure you're okay?

579
00:43:16.088 --> 00:43:19.894
Yeah. I think so.
I'm just a little fucked up.

580
00:43:20.008 --> 00:43:24.517
Well, let me tell you something
that's gonna clear your head right up.

581
00:43:24.638 --> 00:43:25.712
What?

582
00:43:25.764 --> 00:43:28.246
We are officially Mexicans.

583
00:43:29.268 --> 00:43:32.370
We're in Mexico, buddy.

584
00:43:32.438 --> 00:43:33.430
- We are?
- Yeah.

585
00:43:33.522 --> 00:43:35.052
We're heading down to
the rendezvous right now.

586
00:43:35.107 --> 00:43:37.424
We're gonna pound booze, wait for Carlos.

587
00:43:37.526 --> 00:43:40.214
When he gets there,
he's gonna take us down to El Rey.

588
00:43:40.279 --> 00:43:44.622
And then you and I, my brother,
we're gonna kick fuckin' back.

589
00:43:44.741 --> 00:43:47.223
- How do you like them apples?
- Far out.

590
00:43:50.998 --> 00:43:52.196
Where's my glasses?

591
00:43:52.249 --> 00:43:55.848
Yeah, they broke when you fell.

592
00:43:58.088 --> 00:43:59.825
Fuck, Seth, these are like my only pair!

593
00:43:59.923 --> 00:44:01.660
Don't worry about it.
We'll get you another pair.

594
00:44:01.758 --> 00:44:03.908
Of course I'm gonna worry about it.
I can't fuckin' see!

595
00:44:04.011 --> 00:44:05.541
I'll take care of it
when we get to El Rey.

596
00:44:05.596 --> 00:44:07.249
Yeah, like some Mexican hole in the wall
is gonna have my prescription.

597
00:44:07.347 --> 00:44:10.408
It's not a big deal
until you make it a big deal.

598
00:44:10.476 --> 00:44:12.750
Richie, now,
I was in a very good mood.

599
00:44:12.853 --> 00:44:16.245
So stop bringing me down
with this bullshit!

600
00:44:19.151 --> 00:44:20.846
I can't wear this shit.

601
00:44:20.944 --> 00:44:23.426
Hey, guys. We're here.

602
00:44:58.774 --> 00:45:00.469
Pussy!

603
00:45:05.989 --> 00:45:08.967
All right, pussy, pussy, pussy!

604
00:45:09.034 --> 00:45:11.433
Come on in, pussy lovers.

605
00:45:11.495 --> 00:45:14.804
Here at the Titty Twister,
we're slashin' pussy in half.

606
00:45:14.915 --> 00:45:19.382
Give us an offer on our best selection
of pussy. This is a pussy blow-out!

607
00:45:19.503 --> 00:45:24.053
All right, we got white pussy, black pussy,
Spanish pussy, yellow pussy.

608
00:45:24.174 --> 00:45:25.994
We got hot pussy, cold pussy.

609
00:45:26.051 --> 00:45:29.319
We got wet pussy.
We got smelly pussy.

610
00:45:29.388 --> 00:45:32.986
We got hairy pussy, bloody pussy.
We got snappin' pussy.

611
00:45:33.058 --> 00:45:36.243
We got silk pussy, velvet pussy,
naugahyde pussy.

612
00:45:36.353 --> 00:45:39.745
We even got horse pussy,
dog pussy, chicken pussy.

613
00:45:39.856 --> 00:45:42.793
Come on, you want pussy.
Come on in, pussy lovers.

614
00:45:42.859 --> 00:45:46.458
If we don't got it, you don't want it.
Come on in, pussy lovers.

615
00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:56.555
Okay, troops, it's the homestretch.
Here's the deal.

616
00:45:56.665 --> 00:46:01.505
This place closes at dawn. Carlos is gonna
meet us here sometime before dawn.

617
00:46:01.628 --> 00:46:03.861
Now, we are gonna go in there,
we're gonna take a seat,

618
00:46:03.964 --> 00:46:05.825
we're gonna have a drink,
we're gonna have a bunch of drinks.

619
00:46:05.882 --> 00:46:07.950
And we're gonna wait for Carlos.

620
00:46:08.051 --> 00:46:10.781
Let me just say something.
I'm very happy about where we're at.

621
00:46:10.887 --> 00:46:15.437
We got a real nice "I don't fuck with you,
you don't fuck with me" attitude goin' on.

622
00:46:15.559 --> 00:46:19.530
So if everybody just keeps playin' it cool,
I'm talkin' to you, too, Richie,

623
00:46:19.605 --> 00:46:22.376
then everybody's gonna get
what they want.

624
00:46:24.776 --> 00:46:28.457
Okay, hard drinkers, let's drink hard.
I'm buyin'. Come on.

625
00:46:28.572 --> 00:46:29.895
Here we go.

626
00:46:37.247 --> 00:46:39.564
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.

627
00:46:39.666 --> 00:46:44.299
Attention, pussy shoppers!
Take advantage of our penny pussy sale.

628
00:46:44.421 --> 00:46:47.067
If you buy one piece of pussy
at the regular price,

629
00:46:47.174 --> 00:46:52.055
you will get another piece of pussy of
equal or lesser value for only a penny.

630
00:46:52.179 --> 00:46:54.536
Try and beat pussy for a penny.

631
00:46:54.598 --> 00:46:59.106
If you can find cheaper pussy
anywhere, fuck it!

632
00:47:02.564 --> 00:47:07.860
Hey, what do we have approaching here?
A new flavor, apple pie pussy.

633
00:47:09.488 --> 00:47:11.266
Hey, not so fast, slick.

634
00:47:11.365 --> 00:47:12.481
Step aside, asshole.

635
00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:14.816
Son of a...

636
00:47:16.328 --> 00:47:19.430
Now, is my shit together
or is my shit together?

637
00:47:20.916 --> 00:47:22.280
Here we go.

638
00:47:26.213 --> 00:47:29.439
Hi! How ya doin'? Enjoying it? I hope so!

639
00:47:41.144 --> 00:47:44.454
Now, this is my kind of place.

640
00:48:14.219 --> 00:48:16.246
I could become a regular.

641
00:48:31.737 --> 00:48:33.018
Whiskey!

642
00:48:44.875 --> 00:48:48.184
- You can't come in here.
- What do you mean?

643
00:48:48.295 --> 00:48:51.024
It's a private bar. You're not welcome.

644
00:48:51.089 --> 00:48:54.150
Are you tellin' me that
I'm not good enough to drink here?

645
00:48:54.217 --> 00:48:58.023
This bar is for bikers and truckers only.

646
00:48:59.639 --> 00:49:01.460
You, get out!

647
00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:07.712
- Take your hand off of me.
- I'm gonna count to three.

648
00:49:07.814 --> 00:49:10.420
No, I'm gonna count to three.

649
00:49:10.525 --> 00:49:11.559
- One...
- Two...

650
00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:14.133
Now, wait a minute.
There is no reason to get ugly.

651
00:49:14.237 --> 00:49:17.712
There is just a misunderstanding
going on here.

652
00:49:18.909 --> 00:49:22.218
You said this bar is for truckers and bikers?

653
00:49:22.287 --> 00:49:24.272
Well, I'm a truck driver.

654
00:49:24.748 --> 00:49:26.733
If you look outside your
door in your parking lot,

655
00:49:26.792 --> 00:49:30.059
you'll see a big recreational vehicle.

656
00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:31.410
That's mine.

657
00:49:31.505 --> 00:49:35.724
In order to drive that legally,
you need a class two driver's license.

658
00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.869
This bar is for truck drivers?

Welcome to the Titty Twister.

662
00:49:52.108 --> 00:49:55.086
- Bottle of whiskey and five glasses.
- Coming right up.

663
00:50:20.887 --> 00:50:23.783
- You serve food here, José?
- Best in Mexico.

664
00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:25.627
I kind of doubt that.

665
00:50:27.978 --> 00:50:31.949
We're gonna go over here. You send
a waitress over to take our order. Okay?

It's on me.

670
00:51:41.551 --> 00:51:42.750
Pass.

671
00:51:43.553 --> 00:51:45.703
Is it against your religion?

672
00:51:45.805 --> 00:51:49.197
No. I do drink.
I'm just not drinkin' now.

673
00:51:50.018 --> 00:51:51.052
Fair enough. More for me.

674
00:51:51.144 --> 00:51:53.047
- Scott, how about you?
- No.

675
00:51:53.146 --> 00:51:57.075
- Kate, how about you?
- No, I can't. I'm not 21 yet.

676
00:51:57.901 --> 00:51:59.431
That means yes.

677
00:52:00.028 --> 00:52:01.641
Post time, Kate!

678
00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:04.980
Here we go. You slam it down.

679
00:52:05.075 --> 00:52:07.184
You knock the glass down
on the table, all right?

680

682
00:52:16.753 --> 00:52:18.780
Scotty, are you ready? Here we go.
You ready for one?

683
00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:19.914
Okay.

684
00:52:20.006 --> 00:52:21.205
- No, he won't.
- Yes, he will.

685
00:52:21.257 --> 00:52:24.235
Yes, he will, because
I'm not drinking by myself.

686
00:52:24.928 --> 00:52:26.540
Kate, round two.
You ready? Here we go.

687
00:52:26.596 --> 00:52:28.746
Yes, I'll have another one. Thank you.

688
00:52:29.099 --> 00:52:30.545
On three. One, two, three.

689
00:52:42.445 --> 00:52:44.140
Why are you so agitated?

690
00:52:44.572 --> 00:52:47.633
I'm still stewing about that ape
laying his hand on me.

691
00:52:48.284 --> 00:52:49.608
What are you gonna do?

692
00:52:49.703 --> 00:52:51.439
I'm gonna sit here and
I'm gonna finish with this bottle.

693
00:52:51.705 --> 00:52:52.987
And when I'm finished,

694
00:52:53.081 --> 00:52:55.066
I'm gonna take this bottle
and I'm gonna bust it

695
00:52:55.125 --> 00:52:56.861
over his melon fucking head!

696
00:52:58.128 --> 00:53:01.064
Before we stepped in here,
you told all of us to be cool.

697
00:53:01.923 --> 00:53:03.122
So, that means you, too.

698
00:53:03.216 --> 00:53:05.201

702
00:53:31.494 --> 00:53:33.728
- What'd you call me?
- Nothing.

703
00:53:33.955 --> 00:53:37.140
I didn't make a statement.
I asked a question.

704
00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:39.858
- Would you like me to ask it again?
- Mmm-hmm.

705

Are you such a loser,
you can't tell when you've won?

708
00:53:52.891 --> 00:53:54.131

No, they couldn't.

I'm not gonna drain you completely.

787
01:05:21.287 --> 01:05:22.817
You'll be my slave.

788
01:05:24.665 --> 01:05:26.692
Because I don't think you're
worthy of human blood,

789
01:05:26.751 --> 01:05:29.190
you'll feed on the blood of stray dogs.

790
01:05:30.546 --> 01:05:31.703
You'll be my foot stool.

791
01:05:32.256 --> 01:05:35.895
And at my command,
you'll lick the dog shit from my boot heel.

792
01:05:37.803 --> 01:05:39.168
Since you'll be my dog,

793
01:05:39.764 --> 01:05:42.577
your new name will be Spot.

794
01:05:44.769 --> 01:05:47.498
Welcome to slavery.

795
01:05:48.022 --> 01:05:50.007
No, thanks. I already had a wife.

796
01:06:15.591 --> 01:06:16.915
We might be in trouble.

797
01:06:23.432 --> 01:06:25.045
Yo, monkey man.

798
01:06:27.978 --> 01:06:29.591
Anything you got to say to them,

799
01:06:32.358 --> 01:06:33.432
say to me first.

800
01:06:36.278 --> 01:06:37.684
This!

801
01:06:58.175 --> 01:06:59.291
That's enough.

802
01:08:27.765 --> 01:08:29.295
Ain't they supposed to
burn up or something?

803
01:08:38.984 --> 01:08:40.928
Oh, fuck.

804
01:08:52.706 --> 01:08:54.567
Now let's kill that fucking band!

805
01:08:55.626 --> 01:08:56.742
I can do that.

806
01:08:59.546 --> 01:09:01.490
Fuck you, everybody. Good night!

807
01:09:06.053 --> 01:09:07.045
Fuckers.

808
01:09:24.947 --> 01:09:25.939
Hey, buddy.

809
01:09:28.742 --> 01:09:31.059
I'm sorry I fucked things up, Richie.

810
01:09:37.626 --> 01:09:40.025
You would've liked it in El Rey.
You would've...

811
01:09:42.089 --> 01:09:43.287
You would've found peace.

812
01:09:47.094 --> 01:09:48.458
I love you, buddy.

813
01:09:51.515 --> 01:09:52.631
I love you too, Seth.

814
01:10:06.447 --> 01:10:08.596
You touch my brother with that stake, biker,

815
01:10:08.657 --> 01:10:10.228
and vampires aren't gonna
have to suck your blood.

816
01:10:10.325 --> 01:10:11.814
They'll be able to lick it up off the floor.

817
01:10:11.869 --> 01:10:13.026
He's not your brother anymore.

818
01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:16.346
That's a matter of opinion
and I don't give a fuck about yours.

819
01:10:16.498 --> 01:10:20.304
Don't be a fool! He'll kill us all.

820
01:10:20.377 --> 01:10:22.156
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

821
01:10:22.713 --> 01:10:24.533
Let's go. Move, move.

822
01:10:41.690 --> 01:10:42.765
Hold him down.

823
01:10:49.156 --> 01:10:50.313
Richie.

824
01:10:51.617 --> 01:10:55.588
Here is the peace in death,
that I could not give you in life.

825
01:11:11.929 --> 01:11:13.045
Fuck!

826
01:11:24.066 --> 01:11:26.879
Seth, are you okay?

827
01:11:27.194 --> 01:11:29.717
I'm peachy, Kate.
The world is my oyster.

828
01:11:34.243 --> 01:11:35.979
Except for the fact that I just...

829
01:11:37.955 --> 01:11:41.553
I just rammed a wooden stake
into my brother's chest,

830
01:11:41.625 --> 01:11:43.652
because he turned into a vampire.

831
01:11:44.253 --> 01:11:46.279
Even though I don't believe in vampires.

832
01:11:46.713 --> 01:11:49.816
Aside from that unfortunate business,

833
01:11:50.926 --> 01:11:52.373
everything is hunky-dory.

834
01:11:55.806 --> 01:11:58.701
- I'm really, really sorry.
- Bullshit! Bullshit!

835
01:12:00.602 --> 01:12:03.042
If it were up to you,
if you had half a chance,

836
01:12:03.272 --> 01:12:05.008
you would feed us to those fucks.

837
01:12:05.190 --> 01:12:06.389
Then why didn't I?

838
01:12:10.737 --> 01:12:13.674
I'm sorry you lost your brother.
I'm sorry he's dead.

839
01:12:14.116 --> 01:12:15.936
I'm sorry everybody's dead.

840
01:12:16.368 --> 01:12:20.587
But if we're gonna get out of this,
we need you clean and sober and thinking.

841
01:12:20.706 --> 01:12:21.780
Not drunk.

842
01:12:25.961 --> 01:12:27.118
What is that?

843
01:12:27.379 --> 01:12:31.391
Don't know.
First I thought it was just birds.

844
01:12:35.012 --> 01:12:36.045
Bats.

845
01:12:42.936 --> 01:12:43.970
Gimme a hand.

846
01:13:32.319 --> 01:13:33.353
No!

847
01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:37.314
Hey!

848
01:13:53.090 --> 01:13:54.578
I'm sorry.

849
01:13:55.717 --> 01:13:56.792
Come on!

850
01:14:06.770 --> 01:14:10.699
We'll take care of this mess,
you go stake the rest of those ugly fucks.

851
01:14:10.899 --> 01:14:11.933
Way ahead of you.

852
01:14:13.527 --> 01:14:16.381
- Watch your step. What's your name, girlie?
- Kate. What's yours?

853
01:14:16.446 --> 01:14:18.555
- Sex Machine. Pleased to meet you, Kate.
- You, too.

854
01:15:43.658 --> 01:15:46.801
- Is everybody okay?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

855
01:15:52.167 --> 01:15:54.194
Does anybody know
what's going on here?

856
01:15:54.294 --> 01:15:55.493
I know what's going on.

857
01:15:56.046 --> 01:15:57.907
We've got a bunch
of fucking vampires out there,

858
01:15:58.006 --> 01:16:00.652
trying to get in here
and suck our fucking blood,

859
01:16:00.759 --> 01:16:02.372
and that's it, plain and simple.

860
01:16:02.469 --> 01:16:05.282
And I don't wanna hear anything about
"I don't believe in vampires."

861
01:16:05.347 --> 01:16:10.063
Because I don't fucking believe in vampires,
but I believe in my own two eyes,

862
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:12.916
and what I saw is fucking vampires.

863
01:16:13.021 --> 01:16:16.702
Now, do we all agree that what
we are dealing with is vampires?

864
01:16:17.359 --> 01:16:19.634
- Yes.
- You, too, preacher?

865
01:16:20.362 --> 01:16:23.671
I don't believe in vampires,
but I believe in what I saw.

866
01:16:23.782 --> 01:16:26.884
Good for you. All right, now that we all
agree that we're dealing with vampires,

867
01:16:26.993 --> 01:16:28.524
what do we know about vampires?

868
01:16:29.246 --> 01:16:31.396
Crosses hurt vampires. Do we have a cross?

869
01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:33.322
In the motor home.

870
01:16:33.375 --> 01:16:34.409
In other words, no.

871
01:16:34.501 --> 01:16:37.727
Wait a second. I mean, just look around.
We got crosses all over the place.

872
01:16:37.838 --> 01:16:40.651
All you gotta do is put two sticks together
and you got a cross.

873
01:16:40.715 --> 01:16:43.197
Yeah, he's right.
Peter Cushing does that all the time.

874
01:16:43.301 --> 01:16:46.486
Okay, I'll buy that.
So, we got crosses covered. What else?

875
01:16:46.721 --> 01:16:49.327
Wooden stakes in the heart
have been working pretty good so far.

876
01:16:49.474 --> 01:16:54.686
And garlic, sunlight, holy water.
I'm not sure.

877
01:16:54.855 --> 01:16:56.881
Doesn't silver have
something to do with vampires?

878
01:16:56.982 --> 01:16:58.222
That's werewolves.

879
01:16:58.316 --> 01:16:59.763
I know silver bullets are werewolves.

880
01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:02.135
But I'm sure silver has
something to do with vampires.

881
01:17:02.237 --> 01:17:04.264
Well, does anybody have any silver?

882
01:17:07.242 --> 01:17:08.895
Okay. Then, who cares?

883
01:17:10.245 --> 01:17:12.809
Has anybody here read
a real book about vampires,

884
01:17:12.914 --> 01:17:15.272
or are we just remembering
what some movie said?

885
01:17:15.792 --> 01:17:18.770
- I mean, a real book.
- You mean like a Time-Life book?

886
01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:21.692
I take it the answer's no. Okay, then.

887
01:17:21.756 --> 01:17:23.990
What do we know
about these vampires?

888
01:17:24.134 --> 01:17:27.649
We know they got superhuman strength,
but we can hurt them.

889
01:17:27.762 --> 01:17:29.333
- Yeah.
- Another thing, though is

890
01:17:29.431 --> 01:17:31.416
if you're gonna drive
a chair leg through a human,

891
01:17:31.766 --> 01:17:33.751
you better be one strong son of a bitch.

892
01:17:33.852 --> 01:17:37.491
I mean, the human body is
one rough, tough machine.

893
01:17:37.772 --> 01:17:41.082
But these vamps, these vamps,
they have soft bodies.

894
01:17:41.234 --> 01:17:44.461
The texture of their skin is soft
and they're mushier.

895
01:17:44.571 --> 01:17:46.018
You can push shit right through them.

896
01:17:46.239 --> 01:17:49.424
Conceivably, if you hit one hard enough,
take their head right off.

897
01:17:52.329 --> 01:17:56.465
Actually, our best weapon
against these satanic cocksuckers,

898
01:17:57.292 --> 01:17:58.284
is this man.

899
01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:01.118
He's a preacher.

900
01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:04.403
As far as God's concerned,
we might as well all be a piece of shit,

901
01:18:04.466 --> 01:18:05.954
but he's one of the boys.

902
01:18:06.384 --> 01:18:09.321
Only one problem,
his faith isn't what it used to be.

903
01:18:14.226 --> 01:18:15.921
I've had enough of your taunts.

904
01:18:17.562 --> 01:18:20.913
I'm not taunting you, Jacob.
We need you.

905
01:18:22.108 --> 01:18:25.707
A faithless preacher
doesn't mean shit to us.

906
01:18:29.366 --> 01:18:34.247
A servant of God can take a cross
and shove it up these monsters' asses.

907
01:18:34.329 --> 01:18:38.879
A servant of God can bless the tap water
and make it a weapon.

908
01:18:41.670 --> 01:18:42.786
Jacob,

909
01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:45.534
I know why you lost your faith.

910
01:18:48.510 --> 01:18:53.805
How could holiness exist if your wife can be
taken away from you and your children?

911
01:18:55.767 --> 01:18:58.497
Now, I've always said
that God can kiss my ass.

912
01:18:58.562 --> 01:19:01.912
But I just changed
my lifetime tune about 30 minutes ago.

913
01:19:02.357 --> 01:19:05.956
'Cause I know that whatever is out there
trying to get in,

914
01:19:06.027 --> 01:19:08.302
is pure evil, straight from hell.

915
01:19:08.363 --> 01:19:11.962
And if there is a hell,
and those sons of bitches are from it,

916
01:19:12.033 --> 01:19:15.011
then there has got to be a heaven, Jacob.
There's gotta be!

917
01:19:20.166 --> 01:19:21.365
So, which are you?

918
01:19:23.211 --> 01:19:25.072
Are you a faithless preacher,

919
01:19:25.171 --> 01:19:27.818
or are you a mean
motherfucking servant of God?

920
01:19:37.976 --> 01:19:39.547
I'm a mean...

921
01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:44.175
...servant of God.

922
01:19:51.448 --> 01:19:54.219
I don't know if I can take
much more of that noise.

923
01:19:55.744 --> 01:19:57.150
Sure you can.

924
01:19:59.289 --> 01:20:01.894
You can take it
because you got no choice.

925
01:20:03.376 --> 01:20:07.554
How'd you like to spend 24 hours
of it lying in some muddy ditch,

926
01:20:08.173 --> 01:20:12.184
with nothing but the rotten corpses
of your friends to keep you company?

927
01:20:13.011 --> 01:20:14.624
What are you talking about?

928
01:20:19.601 --> 01:20:21.048
I was in 'Nam.

929
01:20:21.936 --> 01:20:23.218
Back in '72.

930
01:20:25.273 --> 01:20:27.423
I was trapped behind enemy lines,

931
01:20:28.151 --> 01:20:30.218
with my entire squad dead.

932
01:20:32.113 --> 01:20:33.808
They thought they had killed everyone.

933
01:20:35.533 --> 01:20:38.097
Except for me, they was right.

934
01:20:38.787 --> 01:20:40.936
But it wasn't for their lack of trying.

935
01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:43.030
A grenade,

936
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.233
blew up right beside me.

937
01:20:48.463 --> 01:20:49.910
That's why I'm so pretty.

938
01:20:51.132 --> 01:20:54.689
And they start pushing
all them bodies in on top of me.

939
01:20:55.136 --> 01:20:57.286
And all I could do, was lay there.

940
01:20:57.597 --> 01:20:58.796
Play possum.

941
01:20:59.766 --> 01:21:02.289
Listen to the enemy joke, laugh,

942
01:21:02.644 --> 01:21:06.325
hour after hour after hour.

943
01:21:16.366 --> 01:21:18.930
Sex Machine.

944
01:21:18.993 --> 01:21:23.337
Kill them.

945
01:21:25.542 --> 01:21:27.403
So I finally climbed out of this hole

946
01:21:28.837 --> 01:21:31.360
and I sneaked up on the enemy
while he was sleeping.

947
01:21:32.257 --> 01:21:36.559
And I killed one, two, three, four, five...

948
01:22:08.042 --> 01:22:09.821
When I came to my senses,

949
01:22:11.713 --> 01:22:16.139
I realized I had killed an entire VC squad.

950
01:22:16.801 --> 01:22:17.958
Single-handed.

951
01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:21.450
There was blood

952
01:22:22.599 --> 01:22:27.190
and chunks of yellow flesh,
clinging to my bayonet.

953
01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:35.999
To this day, I don't remember...

954
01:22:37.864 --> 01:22:40.387
Get him off of me! Get off of me!

955
01:22:40.450 --> 01:22:42.641
Please! Get him off!

956
01:22:47.290 --> 01:22:48.447
No!

957
01:22:56.132 --> 01:22:57.166
Dad!

958
01:23:11.439 --> 01:23:14.707
He fucking bit me.
He fucking bit me.

959
01:23:16.194 --> 01:23:17.847
What are you gonna do about it?

960
01:23:18.863 --> 01:23:20.103
Come on, Sex Machine.

961
01:23:31.167 --> 01:23:34.103
Oh, shit!

962
01:23:44.639 --> 01:23:47.203
Get up! Get up! Up! Come on!

963
01:23:58.862 --> 01:24:01.261
Go! Fuck!

964
01:24:11.791 --> 01:24:14.769
Wait, we have to go back for my father.

965
01:24:14.836 --> 01:24:16.573
Your dad's dead, Kate.

966
01:25:02.634 --> 01:25:03.916
He is the light.

967
01:25:04.844 --> 01:25:08.112
The people who walk

968
01:25:09.057 --> 01:25:10.545
in the darkness

969
01:25:12.435 --> 01:25:14.792
have seen the light!

970
01:25:39.587 --> 01:25:41.240
Open the door!

971
01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:44.205
Open the door!

972
01:25:48.012 --> 01:25:49.169
Go! Go!

973
01:25:49.555 --> 01:25:50.796
Oh, Daddy!

974
01:25:51.474 --> 01:25:52.921
Jacob, are you bit?

975
01:25:55.269 --> 01:25:56.344
Yeah.

976
01:25:57.105 --> 01:26:00.537
Motherfuck. Motherfucking vampires!

977
01:26:00.608 --> 01:26:04.744
I'm gonna kill every last one of
you godless, fucking pieces of shit!

978
01:26:04.821 --> 01:26:06.641
You bet you are
and I'm gonna help you do it.

979
01:26:07.448 --> 01:26:09.061
But we ain't got much time.

980
01:26:09.367 --> 01:26:12.427
- You're gonna be okay, aren't you?
- No, I'm not.

981
01:26:12.704 --> 01:26:15.682
I've been bit.
In fact, I'm already dead.

982
01:26:16.833 --> 01:26:18.031
Now...

983
01:26:19.544 --> 01:26:22.936
I'd say in the next 20 or 30 minutes,
our friends outside will bust in this door

984
01:26:23.131 --> 01:26:26.273
and I'll probably turn into a vampire
within the hour.

985
01:26:26.384 --> 01:26:27.831
Now, you have two choices.

986
01:26:27.927 --> 01:26:30.947
You can wait for me to turn,
then deal with me.

987
01:26:31.305 --> 01:26:33.208
Or we can kick open that door,

988
01:26:33.641 --> 01:26:37.364
and the four of us can go at 'em,
hit 'em with everything we have.

989
01:26:38.021 --> 01:26:40.170
But if we're gonna go at 'em,
we gotta go at 'em now.

990
01:26:43.609 --> 01:26:44.808
What's this stuff?

991
01:26:46.029 --> 01:26:48.220
My guess is this little dive

992
01:26:48.322 --> 01:26:51.549
has been feeding on bikers
and truckers for a long time.

993
01:26:52.326 --> 01:26:54.436
This is probably the shipments
they stole off the trucks.

994
01:26:54.495 --> 01:26:56.729
I say, let's tear this place
apart for weapons.

995
01:26:56.831 --> 01:26:59.023
So when they burst through that door,
we'll make 'em wish they never did.

996
01:26:59.125 --> 01:27:00.323
I don't care about
living or dying anymore.

997
01:27:00.418 --> 01:27:03.520
I just wanna send as many of
these devils back to hell, as I can.

998
01:27:03.838 --> 01:27:04.912
Amen.

999
01:28:08.236 --> 01:28:10.262
Loving God, bless this water

1000
01:28:10.404 --> 01:28:14.458
and give us your protection and strength
in this, our darkest hour. Amen.

1001
01:28:23.251 --> 01:28:26.601
Before we go any further,
I need you three to promise me something.

1002
01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:30.399
I'll fight with you till the bitter end,
but when I turn into one of them,

1003
01:28:31.217 --> 01:28:32.954
I won't be Jacob anymore.

1004
01:28:34.262 --> 01:28:35.998
I'll be a lapdog of Satan.

1005
01:28:36.931 --> 01:28:40.530
I want you three to promise you'll
take me down, no different from the rest.

1006
01:28:41.310 --> 01:28:42.467
I promise, Jacob.

1007
01:28:43.521 --> 01:28:45.051
Kate? Scott?

1008
01:28:46.482 --> 01:28:47.598
I promise.

1009
01:28:48.818 --> 01:28:51.135
- Scott?
- Yeah, I promise.

1010
01:28:54.448 --> 01:28:56.019
Why don't I believe you?

1011
01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:00.608
I'm gonna ask you two again.

1012
01:29:01.831 --> 01:29:04.148
Then I want you to swear to God,

1013
01:29:04.542 --> 01:29:06.195
that you'll kill me!

1014
01:29:07.503 --> 01:29:11.432
If you don't,
I'm gonna just kill myself right now.

1015
01:29:11.799 --> 01:29:15.067
Now, since you need me,
I think you better swear!

1016
01:29:16.137 --> 01:29:21.929
Kate, do you swear to God
that when I become one of the undead,

1017
01:29:22.727 --> 01:29:23.967
you'll kill me?

1018
01:29:26.355 --> 01:29:27.471
Kate!

1019
01:29:27.982 --> 01:29:30.588
We don't have much time,
so I'm only giving you to the count of five.

1020
01:29:30.651 --> 01:29:34.746
One, two, three, four...

1021
01:29:34.822 --> 01:29:37.635
Okay, all right! I promise I'll do it!

1022
01:29:39.535 --> 01:29:41.644
Good girl. Now, Scott,

1023
01:29:42.246 --> 01:29:44.852
we have even less time,
so I'm giving you the count of three.

1024
01:29:44.957 --> 01:29:47.315
- One...
- No, you don't believe in suicide.

1025
01:29:47.376 --> 01:29:51.388
It's not suicide, if you're already dead.
Two.

1026
01:29:51.839 --> 01:29:54.197
Okay! Okay.

1027
01:29:55.176 --> 01:29:58.650
I'll kill you when you change.
I swear to God, in Jesus Christ's name.

1028
01:29:58.763 --> 01:29:59.755
Thank you, Son.

1029
01:30:00.181 --> 01:30:04.524
Okay, vampire killers,
let's kill some fucking vampires.

1030
01:30:25.373 --> 01:30:29.054
Those who walk in the darkness
have seen the light.

1031
01:30:29.168 --> 01:30:31.856
In the darkness have seen the light.

1032
01:30:33.547 --> 01:30:35.905
In the darkness, the light.

1033
01:30:54.735 --> 01:30:58.168
Those who walk in the darkness
have seen the light.

1034
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:02.480
Kill 'em all!

1035
01:32:29.622 --> 01:32:31.483
Come on! Come on!

1036
01:34:30.784 --> 01:34:31.776
Dad?

1037
01:34:42.671 --> 01:34:44.366
Dad! No, Dad!

1038
01:34:44.590 --> 01:34:46.120
Dad! Dad!

1039
01:34:59.146 --> 01:35:01.338
I swear to God, in Jesus Christ's name.

1040
01:35:03.317 --> 01:35:04.641
Oh, my God!

1041
01:35:06.153 --> 01:35:07.683
Fight now, cry later!

1042
01:35:12.952 --> 01:35:17.254
Get the fuck off!
Get off! Get off! Get 'em off!

1043
01:35:31.595 --> 01:35:32.835
Kill me, Kate.

1044
01:35:35.391 --> 01:35:37.003
Just kill me, Kate.

1045
01:35:38.852 --> 01:35:40.009
I can't.

1046
01:35:59.164 --> 01:36:02.515
- How many bullets you have?
- I don't know. Not many.

1047
01:36:03.168 --> 01:36:05.856
When you run out, start cold-cocking 'em.
Make 'em sing for their supper.

1048
01:36:17.141 --> 01:36:20.284
Seth, should I save the last bullets for us?

1049
01:36:20.936 --> 01:36:23.624
No. Use it on the next fuck
that tries to bite you.

1050
01:36:33.991 --> 01:36:36.266
Shoot more holes. Shoot more holes!

1051
01:36:43.167 --> 01:36:45.069
- Perfect.
- They can't go into the light.

1052
01:36:45.461 --> 01:36:48.645
Perfect. All right, go.

1053
01:36:48.756 --> 01:36:50.576
Hey, Seth, don't leave me.

1054
01:36:53.093 --> 01:36:55.740
Come here. Come here. Come on!

1055
01:36:57.431 --> 01:36:58.423
Come on, you!

1056
01:37:01.602 --> 01:37:02.759
Come here, you fucks!

1057
01:37:04.772 --> 01:37:07.418
Hello?
I'm looking for my friend Seth.

1058
01:37:07.941 --> 01:37:10.755
Carlos! Kick in the door!

1059
01:37:21.246 --> 01:37:22.280
Go!

1060
01:37:23.248 --> 01:37:24.655
Son of a bitch.

1061
01:37:55.239 --> 01:37:56.975
What the fuck was goin' on in there?

1062
01:38:02.621 --> 01:38:04.234
What's the matter with you?
Are you crazy?

1063
01:38:04.331 --> 01:38:09.627
Why, out of all the godforsaken shit holes
in Mexico do we have to meet here?

1064
01:38:11.338 --> 01:38:13.323
One place is just as good as another.

1065
01:38:15.509 --> 01:38:16.708
You ever been here before?

1066
01:38:18.721 --> 01:38:21.781
No. I drove by it a couple times.

1067
01:38:22.182 --> 01:38:24.416
It's a rowdy place.
It's out in the middle of nowhere.

1068
01:38:24.518 --> 01:38:26.793
There'll be no cops.
And it's open from dusk till dawn.

1069
01:38:26.854 --> 01:38:29.170
Didn't you say you wanted to
meet in the morning? Here we are.

1070
01:38:29.231 --> 01:38:32.706
Well, since you just picked this
place out of a hat, my brother is dead,

1071
01:38:32.818 --> 01:38:36.168
that girl's entire fucking family is dead!

1072
01:38:39.742 --> 01:38:40.858
What were they? Psychos?

1073
01:38:41.702 --> 01:38:43.604
They look like psychos?
Is that what they looked like?

1074
01:38:43.704 --> 01:38:44.696
They were vampires.

1075
01:38:44.788 --> 01:38:48.014
Psychos do not explode
when sunlight hits them.

1076
01:38:48.083 --> 01:38:49.862
I don't give a fuck how crazy they are!

1077
01:38:52.421 --> 01:38:55.192
Seth, how can I make it up to you?

1078
01:38:55.924 --> 01:38:58.738
You can't make it up to me, Carlos.
You can't do it.

1079
01:38:59.094 --> 01:39:00.707
Can't make it up!

1080
01:39:04.683 --> 01:39:09.191
15% instead of 30% for my stay
in El Rey, that's a good start.

1081
01:39:11.899 --> 01:39:12.932
Twenty-eight.

1082
01:39:13.734 --> 01:39:15.471
My brother's gone.
You understand that?

1083
01:39:15.569 --> 01:39:18.547
He's gone and he's not coming back
and that is your fault.

1084
01:39:22.201 --> 01:39:23.317
Twenty.

1085
01:39:26.330 --> 01:39:27.487
- Twenty-five.
- Twenty-five.

1086
01:39:29.875 --> 01:39:32.315
Kate. Go to the RV, get the suitcase.

1087
01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:39.582
You look like hell.

1088
01:39:41.428 --> 01:39:43.745
You want a cold beer?
I got some in the car.

1089
01:39:45.974 --> 01:39:47.753
Come on, they're cold. Huh?

1090
01:39:48.393 --> 01:39:49.924
I got Mexican and domestic.

1091
01:40:07.955 --> 01:40:10.146
- So, how do you like the car?
- It's all right.

1092
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.730
I said "like new." This is a '90.

1093
01:40:15.087 --> 01:40:19.016
Hey, it is new, cabrón.
Belonged to a drug dealer friend of mine.

1094
01:40:19.216 --> 01:40:21.615
Hey, he only drove it,
like, 14 times in five years.

1095
01:40:21.677 --> 01:40:23.000
It's like new, I swear to God.

1096
01:40:27.015 --> 01:40:29.745
- So, what do I do, follow you?
- Yeah, follow me.

1097
01:40:29.810 --> 01:40:30.844
All right, let's do it.

1098
01:40:39.987 --> 01:40:40.979
I'm sorry.

1099
01:40:53.792 --> 01:40:55.281
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

1100
01:41:04.344 --> 01:41:06.371
- I'll see ya.
- Seth?

1101
01:41:09.850 --> 01:41:11.421
You need some company?

1102
01:41:15.272 --> 01:41:17.712
Kate, do you know where I'm going?
Do you know what El Rey is?

1103
01:41:20.402 --> 01:41:22.305
- No.
- Hey, Seth.

1104
01:41:24.281 --> 01:41:25.687
It's time to go.

1105
01:41:28.243 --> 01:41:29.525
Go home, Kate.

1106
01:41:33.373 --> 01:41:35.813
I may be a bastard,
but I'm not a fucking bastard.
