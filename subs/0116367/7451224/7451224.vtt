Use caution

6
00:01:17.708 --> 00:01:20.040

00:01:20.125 --> 00:01:22.416
- What do you know?
- Well...

8
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.124
It's a hot goddamn day.

9
00:01:29.417 --> 00:01:31.332
I haven't felt it a bit.

10
00:01:31.417 --> 00:01:34.498
Been inside with the air conditioner
blasting all day long.

11
00:01:34.582 --> 00:01:37.165
- Oh, is that right?
- That's right.

12
00:01:42.208 --> 00:01:44.456
Didn't you break for lunch or nothin'?

13
00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:47.290
All by myself today.
Ate my lunch out of the microwave.

14
00:01:49.457 --> 00:01:52.040
Jesus H. Christ, Pete.

15
00:01:52.065 --> 00:01:56.290
When you gonna learn that microwave food
will kill you faster than a bullet?

16
00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:59.456
I mean, them damn burritos
ain't good for nothin' but a hippie.

17
00:01:59.541 --> 00:02:01.623
When he's high on weed.

18
00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:06.290
- Pull me down a bottle of that Jack, will ya?
- Yeah.

19
00:02:07.791 --> 00:02:10.581
I think I'm gonna get tanked tonight.

20
00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:17.249
What's the matter?

21
00:02:18.833 --> 00:02:20.498
Yep.

22
00:02:20.582 --> 00:02:24.540
It's been one long, goddamn,
hot, miserable, shit-ass, fuckin' day,

23
00:02:24.624 --> 00:02:27.207
every inch of the way.

24
00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:31.249
First off. Nadine over at Blue Chip
got sort of sick.

25
00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:35.082
So she got that goddamn,
Mongoloid boy of hers workin' the grill.

26
00:02:35.125 --> 00:02:38.957
I mean, that fuckin' idiot
doesn't know rat shit from Rice Krispies.

27
00:02:40.083 --> 00:02:41.957
They eat breakfast about 9:00.

28
00:02:42.041 --> 00:02:44.873
And I'm pukin' up pigs in a blanket,

29
00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.748
like a sick, fuckin' dog by 10:30.

30
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:52.623
Isn't there a law or something
against retards serving food to the public?

31
00:02:52.708 --> 00:02:55.373
Well... If there ain't, there oughta be.

32
00:02:55.457 --> 00:02:57.456
I mean, who in the hell knows
what's goin' on

33
00:02:57.499 --> 00:02:58.790
in the mind of a goddamn Mongoloid?

34
00:02:58.874 --> 00:03:03.207
Nadine should've hit that boy
in the head and sold the fuckin' milk.

35
00:03:03.291 --> 00:03:05.790
You could sue the shit out of her,
you know that?

36
00:03:05.874 --> 00:03:08.623
That kid belongs under a circus tent,
not flippin' burgers.

37
00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:12.790
- You could own that fuckin' place.
- Oh, shit, Pete.

38
00:03:12.874 --> 00:03:15.415
What would I do with that grease pit?

39
00:03:15.457 --> 00:03:19.498
Besides, Nadine's got a cross to bear.

40
00:03:19.582 --> 00:03:22.999
I mean, taking care of that potato head.

41
00:03:26.666 --> 00:03:31.415
I guess you heard about that shit
up in Abilene? Bank robbery?

42
00:03:31.457 --> 00:03:33.748
That's all that's been on the box all day.

43
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:36.999
They killed some people, didn't they?

44
00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:40.124
Yeah. Killed four Rangers,

45
00:03:41.416 --> 00:03:43.915
three cops,

46
00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.873
one civilian.

47
00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:50.124
Took a lady bank teller, hostage with them.

48
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:55.707
Supposed to be headed for the border,
which'd bring 'em right my way.

49
00:03:57.624 --> 00:04:01.623
If I get my hands on them crazy, sick,
fuckin' bastards, it's payback time.

50
00:04:01.666 --> 00:04:06.415
I mean... Well, we'll get 'em.

51
00:04:10.457 --> 00:04:11.873
We'll get 'em.

52
00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.289
Oh, I don't doubt it.

53
00:04:14.374 --> 00:04:16.832
Well...

54
00:04:16.916 --> 00:04:19.581
I gotta drain my lizard.

55
00:04:19.624 --> 00:04:20.623
Mind if I use your commode?

56
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:23.832
- Knock yourself out.
- Thank you.

57
00:04:23.916 --> 00:04:26.248
You're welcome.

58
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.331
You think I'm fuckin' playin' with you,
asshole?

59
00:04:37.416 --> 00:04:40.957
Do you want this little girl to die?
Or that little girl? Or yourself?

60
00:04:41.041 --> 00:04:44.373
Or your bosom buddy with the badge?
Now, I don't wanna do it.

61
00:04:44.457 --> 00:04:48.581
But I will turn this place into the fucking,
Wild Bunch if I think you are fuckin' with me.

62
00:04:48.624 --> 00:04:50.165
What do you want from me?
I did what you said.

63
00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:52.165
You let him use the bathroom.

64
00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:54.873
- No store does that.
- He comes in here everyday and we bullshit.

65
00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.832
He's used my toilet a thousand times.
If I told him no,

66
00:04:56.916 --> 00:04:59.165
- he'd know something was up.
- All right, I want him out of here,

67
00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:03.040
in his car and down the road
or you can change the name of this place

68
00:05:03.125 --> 00:05:05.540
to Benny's World of Blood.

69
00:05:14.624 --> 00:05:18.623
- Were you giving that pig signals?
- Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!

70
00:05:22.166 --> 00:05:24.581
- He says you were scratching.
- I wasn't scratchin'!

71
00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:27.456
- Are you callin' him a liar?
- I'm not callin' him a liar, okay?

72
00:05:27.541 --> 00:05:29.790
I'm simply sayin', if I was scratchin',
I don't remember scratchin'.

73
00:05:29.833 --> 00:05:31.373
And If I did scratch,
it's not because I was signaling.

74
00:05:31.457 --> 00:05:32.707
It's because I'm fuckin' scared shitless!

75
00:05:33.874 --> 00:05:36.165
Wait a minute. The guy's in the bathroom.

76
00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:38.289
Why don't I just go back there,
shoot him in the back of the head

77
00:05:38.332 --> 00:05:40.165
- and we can get the hell outta here.
- Don't do that.

78
00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:42.748
Look. You asked me to act natural
and I acted natural.

79
00:05:42.791 --> 00:05:44.124
Under the circumstances, I think I oughta get

80
00:05:44.166 --> 00:05:45.915
a fuckin' Academy Award
for how natural I'm actin'.

81
00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.707
You asked me to get rid of him.
I'm doin' my best!

82
00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:53.289
Well, your best better get
a hell of a lot fuckin' better

83
00:05:53.374 --> 00:05:56.581
or you are gonna feel
a hell of a lot fuckin' worse.

84
00:05:59.582 --> 00:06:01.832
Everybody, be cool. You... Be cool.

85
00:06:15.207 --> 00:06:19.289
Yep. Be back at it tomorrow.

86
00:06:19.374 --> 00:06:22.623
Tonight I'm gonna sit in front of that box
and get higher than a Georgia pine.

87
00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:25.707
How much you want for that hooch, Pete?

88
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:28.581
Oh, $6.50.

89
00:06:28.624 --> 00:06:30.289
Jesus Christ.

90
00:06:30.374 --> 00:06:32.623
- You buckin' for early retirement?
- Shit, yeah.

91
00:06:35.916 --> 00:06:37.957
Hey! Hey!

92
00:06:38.041 --> 00:06:40.748
- What the fuck is that about?
- He signaled the Ranger.

93
00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:43.415
I didn't! Ya gotta believe me! I didn't!

94
00:06:43.457 --> 00:06:45.915
When they were talking,
he mouthed the words, "Help us."

95
00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.707
- You fuckin' liar! I didn't say shit!
- Oh, just shut the hell up!

96
00:06:49.833 --> 00:06:53.082
Hey! You stop it!
What the fuck is your problem?

97
00:06:53.124 --> 00:06:56.790
- Goddamn it.
- Seth, he did it!

98
00:06:56.874 --> 00:06:59.123
You were by the beer cooler
with your back turned.

99
00:06:59.165 --> 00:07:01.623
I was by the magazines. I could see his face!

100
00:07:01.666 --> 00:07:04.999
And I saw him mouth the words, "Help us."

101
00:07:06.207 --> 00:07:08.790
Start the car.

102
00:07:08.874 --> 00:07:11.957
- You believe me, don't you?
- Yes. Shut up and start the car, all right.

103
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.081
- Start the car.
- You believe me?

104
00:07:13.124 --> 00:07:16.456
Start the car. You know that?
Shut the fuck up and start the car.

105
00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:18.957
- Wait a minute.
- I believe you. Start the car!

106
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.623
You're not just saying that?

107
00:07:20.666 --> 00:07:22.373
- You do believe me?
- I believe you! Let's go!

108
00:07:22.457 --> 00:07:24.540
- That means you believe me.
- Yes, I believe you!

109
00:07:24.624 --> 00:07:27.373
You should, because I'm right.

110
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.456
- Richie!
- Yeah?

111
00:07:42.582 --> 00:07:46.873
- You okay?
- He shot me in the fucking hand!

112
00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:51.540
- Like I told you he said "Help us."
- I never said, "Help us"!

113
00:07:51.624 --> 00:07:54.957
Well, that doesn't matter now, because you
got about two fuckin' seconds to live!

114
00:07:57.666 --> 00:07:59.665
- Richie?
- Yeah?

115
00:07:59.749 --> 00:08:02.832
When I count to three,
you shoot the bottles out from behind him.

116
00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:05.289
Oh, yeah!

117
00:08:05.332 --> 00:08:08.707
- One...
- Fuck!

118
00:08:08.791 --> 00:08:10.289
Two...

119
00:08:13.791 --> 00:08:15.206
Three!

120
00:09:08.457 --> 00:09:10.415
What did I tell you? What did I say to you?

121
00:09:10.457 --> 00:09:12.248
I said, "Buy the roadmap and leave."

122
00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:13.790
What the fuck am I supposed to do, Seth?

123
00:09:13.833 --> 00:09:15.998
- He recognized us.
- He didn't recognize shit.

124
00:09:16.082 --> 00:09:18.123
Seth, I'm telling you,
the way he looked at us.

125
00:09:18.165 --> 00:09:20.790
You, especially, I knew he knew.

126
00:09:20.874 --> 00:09:24.956
Low profile! Do you understand
the meaning of the words "low profile"?

127
00:09:24.999 --> 00:09:27.707
"Hey, Richie, how's your hand?"
"lt hurts like a fuckin' son of a bitch!

128
00:09:27.791 --> 00:09:30.289
- "Thanks for askin'."
- Let me tell you what "low profile" is not.

129
00:09:30.374 --> 00:09:34.623
lt is not taking girls hostage.
It is not shooting police.

130
00:09:34.666 --> 00:09:39.498
- lt is not setting fire to a building.
- Bitch, bitch, bitch.

131
00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:48.998
My wife left home about a week ago

132
00:11:50.124 --> 00:11:52.415
She stole the kids
and she took all my dough

133
00:11:55.708 --> 00:12:00.039
Oh, screw it! Goddamn you! Goddamn you!

134
00:12:02.165 --> 00:12:04.123
What the hell do you want?

135
00:12:04.207 --> 00:12:07.623
What do you think I want, you mean,
old bastard? I want a fuckin' room.

136
00:12:08.749 --> 00:12:10.081
Okay, all right.

137
00:12:12.666 --> 00:12:15.331
She peed on the carpet
She shot my horse

138
00:12:15.416 --> 00:12:18.164
Now things are goin'
from better to bad to worse

139
00:12:18.999 --> 00:12:22.540
- Do they have cable?
- No.

140
00:12:24.457 --> 00:12:28.248
- Do they have the X-rated channel?
- No.

141
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:31.331
- Do they have a water bed?
- Nope.

142
00:12:31.416 --> 00:12:33.623
- What do they got?
- They have four walls and a roof

143
00:12:33.708 --> 00:12:35.289
and that's all we need.

144
00:12:45.957 --> 00:12:48.123
All right, pop the trunk.
Let's do this fast.

145
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:59.789
Don't say a word.

146
00:13:03.832 --> 00:13:05.914
You, plant yourself in that seat.

147
00:13:08.957 --> 00:13:12.998
- What are you gonna do with me?
- I said "plant yourself." Plants don't talk.

148
00:13:13.082 --> 00:13:17.289
Now, you wanna get on my good side?
You sit still and you don't make a peep.

149
00:13:22.915 --> 00:13:24.456
All right, how does this feel?

150
00:13:24.541 --> 00:13:26.581
How do you think?
It hurts like a son of a bitch.

151
00:13:31.582 --> 00:13:33.956
- It's wrapped too tight. Nice and easy.
- Okay.

152
00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.289
All right. Okay, I'm gonna go get the money.

153
00:13:56.541 --> 00:14:00.623
It's 6:00.
What time's it get dark around here?

154
00:14:00.666 --> 00:14:02.248
- About 8:00.
- Good.

155
00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:04.956
I'm goin' to the border, check things out.
I'm gonna call Carlos,

156
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.540
try and arrange some sort of a rendezvous.
I don't know what.

157
00:14:07.624 --> 00:14:09.998
Could you see if he could arrange
a better deal than 30%?

158
00:14:10.082 --> 00:14:12.206
It's their stkaurd deal.
They're not gonna change that for us.

159
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.956
- Did you even try and negotiate with them?
- Richie.

160
00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.914
These guys are not spic firecracker salesmen
from Tijuana.

161
00:14:18.957 --> 00:14:21.623
They don't even know the meaning
of the word "barter."

162
00:14:21.665 --> 00:14:26.081
You wanna stay in El Rey, you give them
30% of your loot. It's scripture.

163
00:14:26.124 --> 00:14:29.248
So it is written, so shall it be done.
Yeah, I know, listen.

164
00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:34.289
Hey, you want sanctuary,
you gotta pay the price. The price is 30%.

165
00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:36.956
- All I'm sayin', man...
- This conversation's over.

166
00:14:38.873 --> 00:14:40.415
Okay?

167
00:14:44.124 --> 00:14:45.789
We need to have a talk.

168
00:14:46.582 --> 00:14:48.789
- What's your name?
- Gloria.

169
00:14:48.873 --> 00:14:50.956
Hello, Gloria. I'm Seth.
That's my brother Richie.

170
00:14:50.999 --> 00:14:52.831
Let's cut to the chase.

171
00:14:52.915 --> 00:14:56.331
I'm gonna ask you one question
and all I want is a yes or no answer.

172
00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:00.123
Do you wanna live through this?

173
00:15:00.165 --> 00:15:01.956
- Yes.
- Good.

174
00:15:01.999 --> 00:15:06.331
Rule number one. No noise. No questions.

175
00:15:06.416 --> 00:15:11.956
If you make a noise, Mr. 44 makes a noise.

176
00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.456
If you ask a question, Mr. 44 answers it.

177
00:15:15.499 --> 00:15:20.081
Now are you absolutely,
positively clear about rule number one?

178
00:15:21.541 --> 00:15:24.123
- Yes.
- Rule number two.

179
00:15:24.207 --> 00:15:26.373
You do what we say, when we say it.

180
00:15:26.457 --> 00:15:29.123
If you don't, see rule number one.

181
00:15:30.082 --> 00:15:34.498
Rule number three.
Don't you ever try and fucking run on us,

182
00:15:34.581 --> 00:15:40.580
'cause I got six little friends
and they can all run faster than you can.

183
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:43.706
Open your eyes.

184
00:15:46.207 --> 00:15:49.580
Gloria, you hang in there,
you follow the rules.

185
00:15:49.623 --> 00:15:53.039
And you don't fuck with us
and you'll get out of this alive.

186
00:15:53.707 --> 00:15:56.206
- I give you my word.
- Okay.

187
00:16:04.832 --> 00:16:06.580
I'll be back in a minute.

188
00:16:21.457 --> 00:16:24.123
You wanna come over on the bed
and watch TV with me?

189
00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.206
Hail!

190
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:46.664
Come on.

191
00:16:58.623 --> 00:17:00.248
Have a seat.

192
00:17:08.623 --> 00:17:10.039
Take off your shoes.

193
00:17:26.623 --> 00:17:30.164
You got about two more hours

194
00:17:30.249 --> 00:17:33.373
until we get into El Paso

195
00:17:33.457 --> 00:17:36.123
which is right next to the border.

196
00:17:36.165 --> 00:17:37.998
Then we'll stop at a motel.

197
00:17:38.082 --> 00:17:39.081
Stop?

198
00:17:39.124 --> 00:17:41.455
We're not actually gonna
stop at a motel, are we?

199
00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.373
Yeah, what for? We have a motor home.

200
00:17:44.456 --> 00:17:48.206
We don't wanna stay in
those roach-haven motels, do we?

201
00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:50.039
- We're self-contained.
- We're self-contained.

202
00:17:50.124 --> 00:17:51.622
Okay, okay.

203
00:17:51.665 --> 00:17:56.123
Maybe I was a little overzealous.
But gimme a break, I just bought it.

204
00:17:56.207 --> 00:18:00.039
- How come you wanna stop anyways, Dad?
- I'm exhausted.

205
00:18:00.124 --> 00:18:04.206
Exhausted? Just lie in the back, Dad.
I can drive us into Mexico.

206
00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:07.622
I just bet you would.
Don't even think about it.

207
00:18:07.665 --> 00:18:10.914
Besides, I wanna have

208
00:18:10.957 --> 00:18:13.998
just one night's sleep
in an honest to goodness bed.

209
00:18:14.082 --> 00:18:18.164
The beds in the home are okay, but...

210
00:18:18.249 --> 00:18:21.289
They're not like a real bed.

211
00:18:21.374 --> 00:18:24.164
Excuse me. I have to use the restroom.

212
00:18:34.623 --> 00:18:38.414
Oh, guess what? When I called
the machine to check the messages,

213
00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:41.872
one of them was from Bethel Baptist.

214
00:18:41.957 --> 00:18:44.414
And Tn.. Franklin said that

215
00:18:44.456 --> 00:18:48.580
he wouldn't permanently replace you
until we came back.

216
00:18:48.623 --> 00:18:51.956
- And he said that...
- That's very nice of Ted.

217
00:18:51.999 --> 00:18:55.081
But I'll call him tomorrow
and tell him not to bother waiting.

218
00:19:01.332 --> 00:19:07.414
Daddy, I didn't wanna talk about this
in front of Scott because he gets upset.

219
00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:09.998
But I just wanna know.

220
00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:13.747
Don't you believe in God anymore?

221
00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:17.998
Not enough to be a pastor.

222
00:19:19.124 --> 00:19:23.455
Look, I know this is hard on you kids.

223
00:19:23.498 --> 00:19:27.414
But after Jenny's death, this is
probably the last thing you need,

224
00:19:27.456 --> 00:19:32.164
but my congregation
needs spiritual leadership.

225
00:19:32.249 --> 00:19:35.331
Well... My faith is gone.

226
00:19:35.415 --> 00:19:40.580
To answer your question.
Yes, I do believe in Jesus.

227
00:19:40.623 --> 00:19:44.622
Yes, I do believe in God.

228
00:19:44.665 --> 00:19:47.998
But do I love them?

229
00:19:48.082 --> 00:19:50.123
No.

230
00:19:50.207 --> 00:19:54.706
Well, it's just
that all our lives, you've been a pastor.

231
00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:59.914
And then, one day you're just
gonna wake up and say, "Fuck him"?

232
00:20:01.456 --> 00:20:03.414
I didn't say, "Fuck him."

233
00:20:05.832 --> 00:20:08.622
Every person who

234
00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:13.956
chooses the service of God
as his life's work has something in common.

235
00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.998
I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest,

236
00:20:17.082 --> 00:20:19.956
a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk.

237
00:20:19.999 --> 00:20:25.497
Many, many times during your life,
you'll look at your reflection in the mirror

238
00:20:25.581 --> 00:20:27.789
and ask yourself,

239
00:20:27.832 --> 00:20:30.956
"Am I a fool?"

240
00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.789
I'm not going through a lapse.

241
00:20:33.832 --> 00:20:37.455
What I've experienced is closer to awakening.

242
00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:41.747
But Daddy,

243
00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.330
what do you think Mom would say?

244
00:20:44.415 --> 00:20:48.831
Mama's got nothin' to say. She's dead.

245
00:20:51.124 --> 00:20:54.789
This bloody crime spree
started just a week ago today.

246
00:20:54.873 --> 00:20:57.831
The oldest of the two brothers, Seth Gecko,

247
00:20:57.915 --> 00:21:01.455
was serving time in Rolling's,
Kansas State Penitentiary

248
00:21:01.498 --> 00:21:05.039
for his part in the 1988
Scott City bank robbery

249
00:21:05.124 --> 00:21:08.123
in which two law enforcement
officers lost their lives.

250
00:21:08.207 --> 00:21:13.288
It was while at the courthouse that this man,
his younger brother, Richard Gecko,

251
00:21:13.373 --> 00:21:18.455
a known armed robber and sex offender
pulled off a daring daylight escape,

252
00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:23.831
resulting in the death of four wichita
law enforcement officers and this woman,

253
00:21:23.915 --> 00:21:27.497
Heidi Vogel, sixth grade teacher,
who was run over by the Geckos

254
00:21:27.581 --> 00:21:30.580
during a high-speed pursuit
through downtown wichita.

255
00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:34.831
And earlier today, during a daylight
liquor store robbery in Big Springs,

256
00:21:34.915 --> 00:21:38.789
the Gecko brothers killed
another Texas Ranger,

257
00:21:38.873 --> 00:21:42.123
Earl McGraw and liquor store clerk,
Pete Bottoms.

258
00:21:42.207 --> 00:21:45.205
That changes the death toll to 16.

259
00:21:45.289 --> 00:21:49.539
Five Texas Rangers,
eight police officers, three civilians

260
00:21:49.623 --> 00:21:53.747
and one hostage,
bank teller and mother of four, Gloria Hill.

261
00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.956
For the time being, we're very confident
that we'll apprehend these fugitives

262
00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.956
within the next 48 hours

263
00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:02.081
The Bureau, local law enforcement
and the Texas Rangers

264
00:22:02.124 --> 00:22:06.956
have all joined in forming a dragnet
to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.

265
00:22:06.999 --> 00:22:09.956
Is it safe to assume that because of
the death count involved

266
00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:13.205
and the loss of life
of law enforcement officers,

267
00:22:13.289 --> 00:22:15.455
that the Bureau, the Rangers
and the police force

268
00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:18.123
are taking this manhunt personally?

269
00:22:18.206 --> 00:22:21.123
I would say that's a very safe assumption.

270
00:22:35.623 --> 00:22:38.455
Shit, I was really worried.
Where the fuck you been, man?

271
00:22:38.498 --> 00:22:41.205
- Sightseeing.
- What'd you see?

272
00:22:41.289 --> 00:22:42.455
The cops.

273
00:22:42.498 --> 00:22:44.998
- Did you see the border?
- Yes, I saw the border.

274
00:22:45.082 --> 00:22:46.622
What'd the TV say?

275
00:22:46.665 --> 00:22:50.205
They're gonna apprehend us
in about 48 hours.

276
00:22:50.289 --> 00:22:52.872
I gotta figure out a way
to get us across this goddamn border.

277
00:22:52.957 --> 00:22:58.205
The longer we stay here,
our lives ain't worth shit. Here you go.

278
00:22:58.289 --> 00:23:00.914
We gotta get our asses into Mexico tonight.

279
00:23:00.957 --> 00:23:04.372
Then Carlos is gonna meet us there
at the rendezvous tomorrow morning.

280
00:23:04.456 --> 00:23:09.789
He and his boys,
all of them are gonna escort us into El Rey.

281
00:23:09.873 --> 00:23:11.747
And...

282
00:23:14.331 --> 00:23:16.497
- Where's the woman?
- What?

283
00:23:16.581 --> 00:23:19.497
What do you mean, what? The woman.
The hostage, the fuckin' hostage.

284
00:23:19.581 --> 00:23:21.664
Richard, where is she?

285
00:23:23.289 --> 00:23:24.414
She's in there.

286
00:23:24.456 --> 00:23:27.664
- What the fuck is she doin' in there?
- Seth, wait a minute.

287
00:23:27.748 --> 00:23:29.664
Seth.

288
00:23:39.289 --> 00:23:42.998
Richard, what's wrong with you?

289
00:23:43.082 --> 00:23:44.163
Before you flip out, okay,

290
00:23:44.248 --> 00:23:47.914
- let me just explain what happened.
- Explain to me.

291
00:23:47.957 --> 00:23:52.122
I need an explanation.
What is the matter with you?

292
00:23:52.164 --> 00:23:54.122
There's nothing wrong with me, Brother.

293
00:23:54.206 --> 00:23:56.247
That woman tried to escape
and I did what I had to.

294
00:23:56.289 --> 00:23:59.122
No, the woman wouldn't have
said shit if she had a mouth full of it.

295
00:23:59.164 --> 00:24:01.372
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

296
00:24:01.456 --> 00:24:03.372
- Yeah.
- After you left,

297
00:24:03.456 --> 00:24:07.414
- she became a completely different person.
- Yeah.

298
00:24:08.957 --> 00:24:13.205
Is it me? ls it my fault?

299
00:24:13.289 --> 00:24:15.622
- It's not your fault.
- ls this my fault?

300
00:24:15.707 --> 00:24:18.956
- No, it's her fault. It's not your fault.
- ls this my fault?

301
00:24:18.999 --> 00:24:22.747
- Do you think that this is what I am?
- I don't.

302
00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:26.414
This is not me.
I am a professional fucking thief.

303
00:24:26.456 --> 00:24:30.956
I don't kill people that I don't have to
and I don't fucking rape women.

304
00:24:31.039 --> 00:24:34.122
What you are doing...
What you are fucking doing...

305
00:24:34.164 --> 00:24:38.497
What you are doing is not how it's done.
Do you understand that? Do you?

306
00:24:38.581 --> 00:24:42.497
Just say, "Fucking yes."
Say, "Yes, Seth, I understand."

307
00:24:42.581 --> 00:24:43.580
Yes, Seth, I understand.

308
00:24:43.623 --> 00:24:46.122
Say it. Say, "Yes, Seth,
I fucking understand!"

309
00:24:46.164 --> 00:24:49.414
I understand, Seth. I fucking understand.

310
00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:56.998
We'll get to Mexico and
it's gonna be sweet rosemary

311
00:24:57.081 --> 00:24:58.706
and a hundred proof liquor...

312
00:24:59.832 --> 00:25:03.038
...and rice and beans and none
of this shit's gonna matter.

313
00:25:11.999 --> 00:25:15.622
I can't believe he's stoppin' here.
This place is totally cruddy.

314
00:25:21.873 --> 00:25:24.789
Dad, why are we stoppin' here?

315
00:25:26.748 --> 00:25:29.914
There's nothin' wrong with this place.

316
00:25:29.957 --> 00:25:32.706
It's a flophouse.

317
00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:35.956
It's not a flophouse.

318
00:25:36.039 --> 00:25:38.789
It's basic and it's simple.

319
00:25:38.832 --> 00:25:41.831
That doesn't make it a flophouse.

320
00:25:41.915 --> 00:25:44.706
All right. Well, if it doesn't have a pool,

321
00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:47.580
then we're goin' someplace else.

322
00:25:48.832 --> 00:25:50.789
It has a bed.

323
00:25:50.873 --> 00:25:53.747
That's all I care about.

324
00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:56.288
Well, other places have beds, too,

325
00:25:56.373 --> 00:25:59.330
and they also have a gym...

326
00:26:07.832 --> 00:26:11.372
Geez, what is this guy's problem?

327
00:26:11.456 --> 00:26:13.831
No idea.

328
00:26:18.123 --> 00:26:20.706
Creepy guy.

329
00:26:35.415 --> 00:26:36.414
What?

330
00:26:36.456 --> 00:26:40.372
Yes, I'm your neighbor
from room 11

331
00:26:40.456 --> 00:26:44.455
and I hate to disturb you,
but I'd like to ask a favor.

332
00:26:52.206 --> 00:26:54.622
I hope none of this is disturbin' you.

333
00:27:02.623 --> 00:27:04.580
Hi. I'm from room 11 .

334
00:27:04.623 --> 00:27:08.580
And me and my lady friend need some ice
and we don't seem to have an ice bucket.

335
00:27:08.623 --> 00:27:13.622
If it's not too much trouble, could I possibly
borrow yours? I'll bring it right back.

336
00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:18.706
- Sure.
- Thank you.

337
00:27:26.164 --> 00:27:27.205
What is this?

338
00:27:29.373 --> 00:27:31.038
It's called a punch.

339
00:27:31.623 --> 00:27:33.163
Lose the guitar.

340
00:27:36.623 --> 00:27:38.288
What's your name?

341
00:27:38.373 --> 00:27:40.455
- Jacob.
- Jacob, get up. Get on the bed.

342
00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:43.955
If you make a wrong move,
I will shoot you in the face.

343
00:27:43.998 --> 00:27:45.038
Open your mouth.

344
00:27:45.123 --> 00:27:46.330
Wide!

345
00:27:48.456 --> 00:27:50.955
Let's go.
Let's move the Jap over here, too. Let's go.

346
00:27:59.707 --> 00:28:03.205
So what's the story with you two?
You a couple of fags?

347
00:28:03.289 --> 00:28:04.455
He's my son.

348
00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:06.913
How's that happened?
You don't look Japanese.

349
00:28:06.956 --> 00:28:10.497
Neither does he. He looks Chinese.

350
00:28:11.123 --> 00:28:13.789
Oh, ooh, well, excuse me all to hell.

351
00:28:15.748 --> 00:28:19.080
- What's this about, money?
- It's about money, all right, but not yours.

352
00:28:19.123 --> 00:28:22.747
My brother and I, we're in a little hot water
and we need your assistance.

353
00:28:24.872 --> 00:28:25.871
Stop!

354
00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:29.455
What's goin' on?

355
00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:32.871
We're having a bikini contest
and you just won.

356
00:28:32.956 --> 00:28:35.830
It's okay, honey.
Everything's gonna be all right.

357
00:28:35.914 --> 00:28:38.830
Just listen to your daddy, sugar,
and you don't do anything stupid.

358
00:28:38.914 --> 00:28:41.622
You two, Simon says, sit the fuck down.

359
00:28:41.707 --> 00:28:43.455
Sit down.

360
00:28:46.289 --> 00:28:48.997
Now, where are the keys
to the motor home?

361
00:28:49.456 --> 00:28:52.163
- On the dresser.
- Good. All right.

362
00:28:52.248 --> 00:28:57.038
Richie, you take these keys, you start
this big bastard up and drive it up front.

363
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:05.830
Richie, would you do me a favor
and eat my pussy for me? Please?

364
00:29:05.914 --> 00:29:10.288
- Sure.
- Richie, hey!

365
00:29:10.373 --> 00:29:12.497
Not when you get around to it. Now.

366
00:29:24.623 --> 00:29:28.330
You, Gidget, go in the bathroom
and put on some clothes.

367
00:29:30.415 --> 00:29:33.580
You got three minutes. One second longer,
I shoot your father in the face.

368
00:29:33.623 --> 00:29:35.788
- Do you understand what I just said?
- Yes.

369
00:29:35.872 --> 00:29:37.372
- Do you believe me?
- Yes.

370
00:29:37.456 --> 00:29:40.122
You damn well better. Go.

371
00:29:55.289 --> 00:29:57.664
Look, if you want the motor home,

372
00:29:57.747 --> 00:29:59.746
just take it and get out.

373
00:29:59.789 --> 00:30:04.288
It's not gonna be that easy, Pops.
We're gonna go on a little ride.

374
00:30:07.373 --> 00:30:09.414
Not a chance.

375
00:30:11.206 --> 00:30:14.913
- Come again?
- If you're takin' people, take me.

376
00:30:17.706 --> 00:30:21.122
But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.

377
00:30:21.164 --> 00:30:23.913
Sorry, Pops. I need everybody.

378
00:30:23.956 --> 00:30:27.288
My children are not goin' with you
and that's that.

379
00:30:27.373 --> 00:30:31.871
That's not fucking that. This is fucking this.

380
00:30:31.956 --> 00:30:33.539
Dad.

381
00:30:35.123 --> 00:30:37.580
You sit down. Sit down.

382
00:30:38.998 --> 00:30:41.288
You, go sit over there.
Go sit over there, now. Move it.

383
00:30:41.331 --> 00:30:43.122
Sit down.

384
00:30:47.373 --> 00:30:50.330
Now, I don't have time to fuck around,
so I'm gonna make this simple.

385
00:30:50.415 --> 00:30:52.913
You take your kids
and you get in that motor home

386
00:30:52.956 --> 00:30:55.871
or I will execute all three of you right now.

387
00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:01.663
So, what's it gonna be?

388
00:31:01.747 --> 00:31:03.830
Yes or no, answer.

389
00:31:05.123 --> 00:31:06.622
Yes.

390
00:31:06.664 --> 00:31:09.247
Hey, your old man's all right.
He just saved your life.

391
00:31:11.747 --> 00:31:14.788
Time's up, princess. Here we go.

392
00:31:15.789 --> 00:31:18.455
Okay, ramblers, let's get rambling.

393
00:31:32.415 --> 00:31:33.788
Excuse me.

394
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:36.163
What?

395
00:31:37.498 --> 00:31:41.455
- Where are you takin' us?
- Mexico.

396
00:31:41.498 --> 00:31:43.455
What's in Mexico?

397
00:31:44.289 --> 00:31:45.788
Mexicans.

398
00:31:47.747 --> 00:31:50.580
- Richie?
- Yeah?

399
00:31:51.872 --> 00:31:53.455
Put in your bit.

400
00:32:09.081 --> 00:32:11.788
I grind my teeth.

401
00:32:13.664 --> 00:32:15.705
What are their names?

402
00:32:15.789 --> 00:32:18.497
- Scott and Kate.
- Scott and Kate.

403
00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:20.746
Who's this?

404
00:32:22.872 --> 00:32:25.663
- My wife.
- Where is the little lady?

405
00:32:27.747 --> 00:32:31.955
- ln heaven.
- She dead?

406
00:32:32.039 --> 00:32:33.663
Yes, she is.

407
00:32:33.747 --> 00:32:36.830
How'd she die?

408
00:32:36.914 --> 00:32:38.913
Auto wreck.

409
00:32:40.622 --> 00:32:42.330
Come on, Jacob. Gimme some more details.

410
00:32:42.415 --> 00:32:46.122
How'd it happen?
Some fucking drunk kill her?

411
00:32:46.164 --> 00:32:49.330
No. lt was a rainy night.

412
00:32:51.289 --> 00:32:54.579
The brakes on the car weren't great.

413
00:32:54.622 --> 00:32:57.579
She had to stop suddenly.

414
00:32:57.622 --> 00:33:01.372
She slid on the road. She crashed. She died.

415
00:33:01.456 --> 00:33:04.455
- She died right away?
- Not quite.

416
00:33:05.498 --> 00:33:09.705
She was trapped in the wreck
for about six hours

417
00:33:09.789 --> 00:33:12.497
before she passed on.

418
00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:17.913
Yep. Those acts of God really stick
it in and break it off, don't they?

419
00:33:17.956 --> 00:33:20.705
Yes, they do.

420
00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:23.288
Is that real?

421
00:33:23.331 --> 00:33:26.955
- Yes.
- I've seen one of these things before.

422
00:33:26.998 --> 00:33:30.788
A friend of mine had himself ordained,
a minister of his own religion.

423
00:33:30.831 --> 00:33:34.122
Some way to fuck the IRS.

424
00:33:34.206 --> 00:33:36.455
Is that what you're doing
or are you the real McCoy?

425
00:33:37.206 --> 00:33:39.247
The real McCoy?

426
00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:41.788
You're a preacher?

427
00:33:42.956 --> 00:33:44.913
I was a minister.

428
00:33:45.789 --> 00:33:48.122
"Was" as in not anymore?

429
00:33:48.164 --> 00:33:50.205
- Yes.
- Why'd you quit?

430
00:33:50.289 --> 00:33:51.788
I think I've gotten about

431
00:33:51.872 --> 00:33:54.955
as up close and personal with you
as I'm gonna get.

432
00:33:54.998 --> 00:33:59.913
Let's just keep this friendly, okay, Pops?
Let's not get too sensitive.

433
00:34:01.914 --> 00:34:06.330
You're right. Enough with
the gettin' to know you shit. All right.

434
00:34:06.415 --> 00:34:09.038
I don't give a rat's ass about you
or your fuckin' family.

435
00:34:09.123 --> 00:34:13.080
You can all live forever
or you can die this second.

436
00:34:13.123 --> 00:34:15.288
And I don't give a shit which.

437
00:34:15.331 --> 00:34:17.414
The only things that I care about are me,

438
00:34:17.455 --> 00:34:19.746
that son of a bitch back there in the back
and our money.

439
00:34:19.789 --> 00:34:23.247
So you help us get across the border
without incident.

440
00:34:23.289 --> 00:34:25.955
You stay with us through the night
without trying anything funny,

441
00:34:26.039 --> 00:34:27.913
without trying to escape.

442
00:34:27.956 --> 00:34:31.247
And in the morning,
I'm gonna let you guys go, all of you.

443
00:34:31.289 --> 00:34:33.788
How do I know you'll keep your word?

444
00:34:33.831 --> 00:34:36.288
You have to convince me
you're tellin' the truth.

445
00:34:36.373 --> 00:34:39.205
Look, dickhead, the only thing
that you have to be convinced about

446
00:34:39.289 --> 00:34:43.621
is the fact that you are stuck in a situation
with a couple of real mean motor scooters.

447
00:34:43.664 --> 00:34:46.746
And I don't want to have
to worry about you all fuckin' night.

448
00:34:46.789 --> 00:34:49.746
You know, I don't think you wanna be
worrying about my brother's intentions

449
00:34:49.789 --> 00:34:52.997
towards your daughter all night, either.

450
00:34:53.081 --> 00:34:54.746
Did you notice the way
he was looking at her?

451
00:34:54.789 --> 00:34:55.830
Yes.

452
00:34:55.914 --> 00:34:57.830
- You didn't like it, did you?
- No, I didn't.

453
00:34:57.914 --> 00:35:00.955
I didn't think so. You get us into Mexico

454
00:35:01.039 --> 00:35:05.080
and you don't try to escape
and your daughter will be safe.

455
00:35:05.123 --> 00:35:09.163
And in the morning, I will let you go.
I give you my word, Jacob.

456
00:35:12.455 --> 00:35:15.955
If he touches her, I'll kill him!

457
00:35:15.998 --> 00:35:19.746
Fair enough.
You break your word, I'll kill all of ya.

458
00:36:14.706 --> 00:36:17.997
Did you mean what you said
back there in the room?

459
00:36:19.956 --> 00:36:21.538
What?

460
00:36:24.289 --> 00:36:26.788
In the room?

461
00:36:26.872 --> 00:36:29.454
Did you mean what you said back there,
or were you just foolin' around?

462
00:36:29.539 --> 00:36:34.788
Because if you really want me to do that
for you, I will. I'd be happy to.

463
00:36:37.081 --> 00:36:41.122
- Do what?
- What you said back there in the room?

464
00:36:41.164 --> 00:36:43.413
What did I say?

465
00:36:44.455 --> 00:36:47.288
- You asked me if I would eat...
- Richie.

466
00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:48.329
What?

467
00:36:48.414 --> 00:36:51.205
I told you to watch those kids.
Not to talk to them.

468
00:36:51.289 --> 00:36:54.663
You don't have nothin' to say
to one another. So let's just cut the chatter.

469
00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:59.288
We'll talk later. Okay?

470
00:37:25.455 --> 00:37:27.122
All right, everybody. It's show time.

471
00:37:27.206 --> 00:37:31.663
Richie, you take Kate into the bathroom.
Scott, get up here with your dad. Let's go.

472
00:37:33.914 --> 00:37:36.287
Now, what are you gonna say?

473
00:37:37.956 --> 00:37:39.955
I don't have the slightest idea.

474
00:37:39.998 --> 00:37:43.080
Just keep thinking about the gun
next to Kate's head.

475
00:37:44.956 --> 00:37:46.538
Get in.

476
00:37:56.455 --> 00:37:57.621
This isn't gonna work, Seth.

477
00:37:57.706 --> 00:38:00.621
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine.

478
00:38:01.789 --> 00:38:03.955
Hey, what are you gonna do?

479
00:38:04.998 --> 00:38:07.788
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.

480
00:38:07.872 --> 00:38:10.788
Dad, you have to tell them
that they're back there.

481
00:38:10.872 --> 00:38:12.788
Have you forgotten about your sister?

482
00:38:13.206 --> 00:38:16.413
I want to go on record right now
as saying that this is a very bad idea.

483
00:38:16.455 --> 00:38:18.454
Duly noted. Now shut up.

484
00:38:19.664 --> 00:38:23.413
Oh, my God. Look over here.
Step right over there.

485
00:38:24.455 --> 00:38:27.871
They're gonna kill us, Dad.
They're gonna get us across the border,

486
00:38:27.956 --> 00:38:30.621
take us out in the desert,
then they're gonna fuckin' shoot us.

487
00:38:30.664 --> 00:38:33.122
If they get over the border,
they're gonna let us go.

488
00:38:33.164 --> 00:38:38.746
No, they won't. Dad, come on. I watch those
reality shows. They never let anybody go.

489
00:38:38.789 --> 00:38:42.621
Any cop'll tell you, in a situation like this,
you get a chance, you go for it.

490
00:38:42.706 --> 00:38:44.746
It may not seem like it,
but I know exactly what I'm doing.

491
00:38:44.789 --> 00:38:46.122
You're gonna have to trust me on this.

492
00:38:46.205 --> 00:38:47.997
I can't do that, Dad.

493
00:38:48.455 --> 00:38:50.579
If you don't tell the cops, I will.

494
00:38:50.622 --> 00:38:52.122
Now listen to me!

495
00:38:52.164 --> 00:38:54.913
You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing!
You hear me?

496
00:38:57.414 --> 00:38:59.538
I'm running the show! I make the decisions!

497
00:38:59.622 --> 00:39:01.246
He is running the show.

498
00:39:01.288 --> 00:39:03.329
- I'm running the show! I'm running the show!
- Dad!

499
00:39:05.123 --> 00:39:07.454
Shh. I make the plays.

500
00:39:08.288 --> 00:39:09.371
You back the plays I make.

501
00:39:11.288 --> 00:39:12.955
I need your cover.

502
00:39:14.372 --> 00:39:15.371
Cover me.

503
00:39:21.247 --> 00:39:22.913
How many with you?

504
00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:24.746
Just my son and I.

505
00:39:26.288 --> 00:39:28.454
What's your purpose in Mexico?

506
00:39:28.539 --> 00:39:32.413
Vacation. I'm taking him
to see his first bullfight.

507
00:39:33.039 --> 00:39:34.454
They're gonna search the van.

508
00:39:34.497 --> 00:39:38.788
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut,
we're gonna be just fine.

509
00:39:39.372 --> 00:39:42.246
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

510
00:39:42.288 --> 00:39:44.496
- What?
- You just called me a fuckin' nut.

511
00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:46.663
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

512
00:39:46.747 --> 00:39:49.204
You said, "As long as
I don't act like a fucking nut"

513
00:39:49.288 --> 00:39:51.121
implying that I've been acting
like a fucking nut.

514
00:39:51.205 --> 00:39:53.287
Take a pill, all right. I just meant be cool.

515
00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:55.329
Yeah, you meant that,
but you meant the other, too.

516
00:39:55.414 --> 00:39:57.871
This is not the time, Richie.

517
00:39:57.956 --> 00:40:02.413
Hey, fuck those spic pigs, man!
You called me a "fucking nut."

518
00:40:02.455 --> 00:40:04.454
Now, where I come from,
that stops the train in its tracks.

519
00:40:04.497 --> 00:40:06.454
Keep your fucking voice down.

520
00:40:06.497 --> 00:40:07.663
Or what?

521
00:40:09.622 --> 00:40:11.454
- What was that?
- Hmm?

522
00:40:12.956 --> 00:40:16.788
Oh! That was just...
Just my daughter in the bathroom.

523
00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:20.663
I thought you said
it was just you and your son?

524
00:40:21.706 --> 00:40:24.830
Um, I meant me and my son
and my daughter.

525
00:40:26.956 --> 00:40:28.997
Open up. I'm comin' aboard.

526
00:40:35.455 --> 00:40:39.079
What was the nuttiest thing I did, Seth?
I'm curious. Tell me. What was it?

527
00:40:39.122 --> 00:40:41.413
- This is not the time, Richie.
- I know.

528
00:40:41.455 --> 00:40:44.038
Was it possibly when your ass
was rotting in jail and I broke it out?

529
00:40:44.122 --> 00:40:45.121
ls that the nuttiest thing?

530
00:40:45.163 --> 00:40:47.955
That was nutty, huh? Not to mention stupid.

531
00:40:52.455 --> 00:40:53.705
Thanks.

532
00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:10.788
I'm in the bathroom.

533
00:41:10.872 --> 00:41:12.663
Open up. It's Border Patrol.

534
00:41:12.747 --> 00:41:14.329
It's open.

535
00:41:18.956 --> 00:41:23.121
Do you mind? Shut the fuckin' door, please!

536
00:41:24.831 --> 00:41:26.162
Excuse me.

537
00:41:38.956 --> 00:41:41.121
Goddamn, that was intense!

538
00:41:47.414 --> 00:41:49.454
Oh, baby, we did it. We're in Mexico.

539
00:41:49.497 --> 00:41:53.329
We're fuckin' in Mexico,
you little piece of fuckin' shit!

540
00:41:53.414 --> 00:41:55.454
Come on! Kate, get out here.

541
00:42:00.205 --> 00:42:02.287
All right, listen up. Everybody, listen.

542
00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:04.121
Now I know that I put you all through hell,

543
00:42:04.205 --> 00:42:06.746
and I know that I have been
one rough pecker.

544
00:42:06.789 --> 00:42:10.579
But from here on out,
you guys are all in my cool book.

545
00:42:10.622 --> 00:42:13.830
Scotty, I want you to help me with Richie.
We'll lay him down on the couch over there.

546
00:42:13.914 --> 00:42:16.079
Jacob, you're gonna keep
driving down this street

547
00:42:16.122 --> 00:42:18.287
until you come to another street
called De Gallo.

548
00:42:18.372 --> 00:42:21.621
When you get to De Gallo,
you're gonna turn this big bastard left,

549
00:42:21.706 --> 00:42:25.413
and you're gonna go down a couple of miles
until you see a bar called the Titty Twister.

550
00:42:25.455 --> 00:42:27.204
From what I understand, you cannot miss it.

551
00:42:27.288 --> 00:42:28.287
Then?

552
00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:31.621
And then you stop because
that's where we're going.

553
00:42:46.288 --> 00:42:48.287
Don't make a career out of this, okay?

554
00:42:48.372 --> 00:42:49.454
Come on, hey.

555
00:42:50.789 --> 00:42:52.496
Hey, you okay?

556
00:42:54.622 --> 00:42:57.663
Yeah, I think so. What happened?

557
00:42:57.747 --> 00:43:00.079
I don't know. You just passed out.

558
00:43:00.122 --> 00:43:01.121
I did?

559
00:43:01.205 --> 00:43:03.162
Mmm-hmm. You said something
about your hand hurtin'

560
00:43:03.247 --> 00:43:04.830
and then you just hit the ground
like a sack of potatoes.

561
00:43:05.955 --> 00:43:07.579
Really?

562
00:43:07.622 --> 00:43:10.413
Head hit the toilet.
You scared the shit out of me.

563
00:43:10.455 --> 00:43:12.538
You sure you're okay?

564
00:43:13.664 --> 00:43:17.496
Yeah. I think so. I'm just a little fucked up.

565
00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:22.121
Well, let me tell you something
that's gonna clear your head right up.

566
00:43:22.205 --> 00:43:23.287
What?

567
00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:25.830
We are officially Mexicans.

568
00:43:26.831 --> 00:43:29.954
We're in Mexico, buddy.

569
00:43:29.997 --> 00:43:30.996
- We are?
- Yeah.

570
00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:32.621
We're heading down to
the rendezvous right now.

571
00:43:32.664 --> 00:43:34.996
We're gonna pound booze, wait for Carlos.

572
00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:37.788
When he gets there,
he's gonna take us down to El Rey.

573
00:43:37.831 --> 00:43:42.204
And then you and I, my brother,
we're gonna kick fuckin' back.

574
00:43:42.288 --> 00:43:44.788
- How do you like them apples?
- Far out.

575
00:43:48.539 --> 00:43:49.746
Where's my glasses?

576
00:43:49.789 --> 00:43:53.413
Oh, uh... Yeah, they broke when you fell.

577
00:43:55.622 --> 00:43:57.371
Fuck, Seth, these are like my only pair!

578
00:43:57.455 --> 00:43:59.204
Don't worry about it.
We'll get you another pair.

579
00:43:59.288 --> 00:44:01.454
Of course I'm gonna worry about it.
I can't fuckin' see!

580
00:44:01.539 --> 00:44:03.079
I'll take care of it when we get to El Rey.

581
00:44:03.122 --> 00:44:04.788
Yeah, like some Mexican hole in the wall
is gonna have my prescription.

582
00:44:04.871 --> 00:44:07.954
It's not a big deal
until you make it a big deal.

583
00:44:07.997 --> 00:44:10.287
Richie, now, I was in a very good mood.

584
00:44:10.372 --> 00:44:13.788
So stop bringing me down
with this bullshit!

585
00:44:16.664 --> 00:44:18.371
I can't wear this shit.

586
00:44:18.455 --> 00:44:20.954
Hey, guys. We're here.

587
00:44:56.247 --> 00:44:57.954
Pussy!

588
00:45:03.455 --> 00:45:06.454
All right, pussy, pussy, pussy!

589
00:45:06.497 --> 00:45:08.912
Come on in, pussy lovers.

590
00:45:08.955 --> 00:45:12.287
Here at the Titty Twister,
we're slashin' pussy in half.

591
00:45:12.372 --> 00:45:16.870
Give us an offer on our best selection
of pussy. This is a pussy blowout!

592
00:45:16.955 --> 00:45:21.538
All right, we got white pussy, black pussy,
Spanish pussy, yellow pussy.

593
00:45:21.622 --> 00:45:23.454
We got hot pussy, cold pussy.

594
00:45:23.497 --> 00:45:26.787
We got wet pussy. We got smelly pussy.

595
00:45:26.830 --> 00:45:30.454
We got hairy pussy, bloody pussy.
We got snappin' pussy.

596
00:45:30.497 --> 00:45:33.705
We got silk pussy, velvet pussy,
naugahyde pussy.

597
00:45:33.788 --> 00:45:37.204
We even got horse pussy,
dog pussy, chicken pussy.

598
00:45:37.288 --> 00:45:40.246
Come on, you want pussy.
Come on in, pussy lovers.

599
00:45:40.288 --> 00:45:43.912
If we don't got it, you don't want it.
Come on in, pussy lovers.

600
00:45:50.788 --> 00:45:53.996
Okay, troops, it's the homestretch.
Here's the deal.

601
00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:58.954
This place closes at dawn. Carlos is gonna
meet us here sometime before dawn.

602
00:45:59.038 --> 00:46:01.287
Now, we are gonna go in there,
we're gonna take a seat,

603
00:46:01.372 --> 00:46:03.246
we're gonna have a drink,
we're gonna have a bunch of drinks.

604
00:46:03.288 --> 00:46:05.371
And we're gonna wait for Carlos.

605
00:46:05.455 --> 00:46:08.204
Let me just say something.
I'm very happy about where we're at.

606
00:46:08.288 --> 00:46:12.870
We got a real nice "I don't fuck with you,
you don't fuck with me" attitude goin' on.

607
00:46:12.955 --> 00:46:16.954
So if everybody just keeps playin' it cool,
I'm talkin' to you, too, Richie,

608
00:46:16.997 --> 00:46:19.787
then everybody's gonna get what they want.

609
00:46:22.163 --> 00:46:25.870
Okay, hard drinkers, let's drink hard.
I'm buyin'. Come on.

610
00:46:25.955 --> 00:46:27.287
Here we go.

611
00:46:34.622 --> 00:46:36.954
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.

612
00:46:37.038 --> 00:46:41.705
Attention, pussy shoppers!
Take advantage of our penny pussy sale.

613
00:46:41.788 --> 00:46:44.454
If you buy one piece of pussy
at the regular price,

614
00:46:44.539 --> 00:46:49.454
you will get another piece of pussy of
equal or lesser value for only a penny.

615
00:46:49.539 --> 00:46:51.912
Try and beat pussy for a penny.

616
00:46:51.955 --> 00:46:56.496
If you can find cheaper pussy
anywhere, fuck it!

617
00:46:59.913 --> 00:47:05.246
Hey, what do we have approaching here?
A new flavor, apple pie pussy.

618
00:47:06.830 --> 00:47:08.621
Hey, not so fast, slick.

619
00:47:08.705 --> 00:47:09.829
Step aside, asshole.

620
00:47:11.038 --> 00:47:12.162
Son of a...

621
00:47:13.664 --> 00:47:16.787
Now, is my shit together
or is my shit together?

622
00:47:18.247 --> 00:47:19.621
Here we go.

623
00:47:23.539 --> 00:47:26.787
Hi! How ya doin'? Enjoying it? I hope so!

624
00:47:38.455 --> 00:47:41.787
Now, this is my kind of place.

625
00:48:11.497 --> 00:48:13.538
I could become a regular.

626
00:48:28.997 --> 00:48:30.287
Whiskey!

627
00:48:42.122 --> 00:48:45.454
- You can't come in here.
- What do you mean?

628
00:48:45.539 --> 00:48:48.287
It's a private bar. You're not welcome.

629
00:48:48.330 --> 00:48:51.413
Are you tellin' me that
I'm not good enough to drink here?

630
00:48:51.455 --> 00:48:55.287
This bar is for bikers and truckers only.

631
00:48:56.871 --> 00:48:58.704
You, get out!

632
00:49:02.746 --> 00:49:04.954
- Take your hand off of me.
- I'm gonna count to three.

633
00:49:05.038 --> 00:49:07.662
No, I'm gonna count to three.

634
00:49:07.746 --> 00:49:08.787
- One...
- Two...

635
00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:11.371
Now, wait a minute.
There is no reason to get ugly.

636
00:49:11.455 --> 00:49:14.954
There is just a misunderstanding
going on here.

637
00:49:16.122 --> 00:49:19.454
You said this bar is for truckers and bikers?

638
00:49:19.497 --> 00:49:21.496
Well, I'm a truck driver.

639
00:49:21.955 --> 00:49:23.954
If you look outside your
door in your parking lot,

640
00:49:23.997 --> 00:49:27.287
you'll see a big recreational vehicle.

641
00:49:27.372 --> 00:49:28.620
That's mine.

642
00:49:28.705 --> 00:49:32.954
In order to drive that legally,
you need a class two driver's license.

643
00:49:33.955 --> 00:49:36.079
This bar is for truck drivers?

644
00:49:36.122 --> 00:49:37.996
I am a truck driver.

645
00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:39.954
These are my friends.

646
00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:49.246
Welcome to the Titty Twister.

647
00:49:49.288 --> 00:49:52.287
- Bottle of whiskey and five glasses.
- Coming right up.

648
00:50:18.038 --> 00:50:20.954
- You serve food here, José?
- Best in Mexico.

649
00:50:21.038 --> 00:50:22.787
I kind of doubt that.

650
00:50:25.122 --> 00:50:29.121
We're gonna go over here. You send
a waitress over to take our order. Okay?

651
00:51:29.746 --> 00:51:33.954
Anytime you want a lap dance with
that girl, kid, just let me know, all right?

652
00:51:33.997 --> 00:51:35.371
It's on me.

653
00:51:38.621 --> 00:51:39.829
Pass.

654
00:51:40.621 --> 00:51:42.787
Is it against your religion?

655
00:51:42.871 --> 00:51:46.287
No. I do drink. I'm just not drinkin' now.

656
00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:48.121
Fair enough. More for me.

657
00:51:48.205 --> 00:51:50.121
- Scott, how 'bout you?
- No.

658
00:51:50.205 --> 00:51:54.162
- Kate, how 'bout you?
- No, I can't. I'm not 21 yet.

659
00:51:54.955 --> 00:51:56.495
That means yes.

660
00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.704
Post time, Kate!

661
00:52:00.788 --> 00:52:02.037
Here we go. You slam it down.

662
00:52:02.122 --> 00:52:04.246
You knock the glass down
on the table, all right?

663
00:52:04.288 --> 00:52:05.912
One, two, three!

664
00:52:11.830 --> 00:52:13.704
Attagirl, Kate.

665
00:52:13.788 --> 00:52:15.829
Scotty, are you ready? Here we go.
You ready for one?

666
00:52:15.913 --> 00:52:16.954
Okay.

667
00:52:17.038 --> 00:52:18.246
- No, he won't.
- Yes, he will.

668
00:52:18.288 --> 00:52:21.287
Yes, he will, because
I'm not drinking by myself.

669
00:52:21.955 --> 00:52:23.578
Kate, round two.
You ready? Here we go.

670
00:52:23.621 --> 00:52:25.787
Yes, I'll have another one. Thank you.

671
00:52:26.122 --> 00:52:27.578
On three. One, two, three.

672
00:52:39.454 --> 00:52:41.162
Why are you so agitated?

673
00:52:41.579 --> 00:52:44.662
I'm still stewing about that ape
laying his hand on me.

674
00:52:45.288 --> 00:52:46.620
What are you gonna do?

675
00:52:46.705 --> 00:52:48.453
I'm gonna sit here and
I'm gonna finish with this bottle.

676
00:52:48.705 --> 00:52:49.996
And when I'm finished,

677
00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:52.079
I'm gonna take this bottle
and I'm gonna bust it

678
00:52:52.122 --> 00:52:53.870
over his melon fucking head!

679
00:52:55.122 --> 00:52:58.079
Before we stepped in here,
you told all of us to be cool.

680
00:52:58.913 --> 00:53:00.121
So, that means you, too.

681
00:53:00.205 --> 00:53:02.204
I never said do what I do.
I said do what I say.

682
00:53:04.997 --> 00:53:07.246
On my way I passed it

683
00:53:08.871 --> 00:53:10.246
Express yourself

684
00:53:23.830 --> 00:53:28.121
Are you such a fucking loser,
you can't tell when you've won?

685
00:53:28.454 --> 00:53:30.704
- What'd you call me?
- Nothing.

686
00:53:30.913 --> 00:53:34.121
I didn't make a statement.
I asked a question.

687
00:53:34.454 --> 00:53:36.829
- Would you like me to ask it again?
- Mmm-hmm.

688
00:53:37.621 --> 00:53:40.537
Are you such a loser,
you can't tell when you've won?

689
00:53:42.663 --> 00:53:46.620
The entire state of Texas,
along with the FBI,

690
00:53:47.413 --> 00:53:48.662
are looking for you.

691
00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:51.079
Did they find you?

692
00:53:52.122 --> 00:53:53.328
No, they couldn't.

693
00:53:54.413 --> 00:53:55.662
You've won, Seth.

694
00:53:57.913 --> 00:53:58.954
Enjoy it.

695
00:54:01.871 --> 00:54:02.996
Jacob,

696
00:54:05.371 --> 00:54:08.370
I want you to have a drink with me. I insist.

697
00:54:13.371 --> 00:54:14.620
To your family.

698
00:54:15.788 --> 00:54:16.870
To yours.

699
00:54:25.621 --> 00:54:28.037
And now, for your viewing pleasure,

700
00:54:28.621 --> 00:54:30.204
the mistress of the macabre,

701
00:54:31.496 --> 00:54:32.745
the epitome of evil,

702
00:54:32.997 --> 00:54:35.870
the most sinister woman
to ever dance on the face of this Earth

703
00:54:36.246 --> 00:54:38.620
- Bite this!
- Lowly dog!

704
00:54:39.454 --> 00:54:43.245
Bow your head, kneel and worship

705
00:54:43.579 --> 00:54:47.328
at the feet of Santanico Pandemonium

706
00:59:06.788 --> 00:59:08.537
That's what I call a fucking show!

707
00:59:12.621 --> 00:59:13.704
Wow!

708
00:59:23.996 --> 00:59:25.036
Come here!

709
00:59:26.954 --> 00:59:28.537
That guy! It's the puta over there!

710
00:59:28.621 --> 00:59:29.912
Richie, get back on the clock.

711
00:59:32.579 --> 00:59:34.704
- How many?
- Three.

712
00:59:37.579 --> 00:59:38.578
Which one?

713
00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:44.161
This piece of shit here, man.
Broke my finger and my nose!

714
00:59:44.954 --> 00:59:47.829
And this faggot kicked me
in the ribs while I was down.

715
00:59:48.204 --> 00:59:50.787
- Up!
- Fuck you, bogeyman!

716
00:59:56.329 --> 00:59:57.620
Fuck!

717
01:00:00.579 --> 01:00:01.870
Fuck you!

718
01:00:12.788 --> 01:00:16.328
All right, everybody be cool,
or you'll be just as dead as these fucks!

719
01:00:18.287 --> 01:00:20.286
How's your hand? Let me see it.

720
01:00:23.037 --> 01:00:24.078
Shit.

721
01:00:33.621 --> 01:00:35.036
You think that was funny?

722
01:00:46.037 --> 01:00:47.078
Sit down!

723
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:13.161
Richie, look out!

724
01:01:13.413 --> 01:01:16.286
Motherfucking shit! Get the fuck off me!

725
01:01:16.705 --> 01:01:18.328
- Hey! Hey!
- Get her off me!

726
01:01:19.954 --> 01:01:21.620
What the fuck are you doing? Shoot her!

727
01:01:23.996 --> 01:01:25.120
I'm coming, buddy!

728
01:01:31.162 --> 01:01:32.662
- Richie. Rich.
- You bitch.

729
01:01:34.496 --> 01:01:35.537
Richie.

730
01:01:37.371 --> 01:01:38.953
Fucking bitch!

731
01:01:40.413 --> 01:01:41.453
Richie.

732
01:01:50.162 --> 01:01:51.203
Hey.

733
01:02:07.079 --> 01:02:08.328
What the fuck?

734
01:02:15.538 --> 01:02:17.704
Dinner is served.

735
01:02:26.162 --> 01:02:27.537
What the fuck?

736
01:02:38.246 --> 01:02:39.786
Get off me!

737
01:02:55.705 --> 01:02:57.286
Come on! Come on, you!

738
01:02:58.579 --> 01:02:59.704
Jacob!

739
01:03:03.787 --> 01:03:05.786
Oh, no! Look out! Look out!

740
01:03:13.454 --> 01:03:15.704
You know what everybody
says about me, huh?

741
01:03:16.371 --> 01:03:17.453
I suck!

742
01:03:47.787 --> 01:03:49.786
Get off me! What the fuck are you doing?

743
01:03:56.162 --> 01:03:58.953
Let's see if you taste
as good as your brother.

744
01:04:01.079 --> 01:04:02.078
Fuck you!

745
01:04:22.413 --> 01:04:23.412
Hey! Hey!

746
01:04:39.037 --> 01:04:40.036
Oh, shit!

747
01:04:47.787 --> 01:04:48.828
Huh?

748
01:04:55.454 --> 01:04:56.495
Gimme that!

749
01:05:14.371 --> 01:05:16.619
I'm not gonna drain you completely.

750
01:05:17.538 --> 01:05:19.078
You'll be my slave.

751
01:05:20.912 --> 01:05:22.953
Because I don't think you're
worthy of human blood,

752
01:05:22.996 --> 01:05:25.453
you'll feed on the blood of stray dogs.

753
01:05:26.787 --> 01:05:27.953
You'll be my foot stool.

754
01:05:28.496 --> 01:05:32.161
And at my command,
you'll lick the dog shit from my boot heel.

755
01:05:34.037 --> 01:05:35.412
Since you'll be my dog,

756
01:05:35.996 --> 01:05:38.828
your new name will be Spot.

757
01:05:40.996 --> 01:05:43.744
Welcome to slavery.

758
01:05:44.246 --> 01:05:46.245
No, thanks. I already had a wife.

759
01:06:11.787 --> 01:06:13.120
We might be in trouble.

760
01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:21.245
Yo, monkey man.

761
01:06:24.162 --> 01:06:25.786
Anything you got to say to them,

762
01:06:28.537 --> 01:06:29.619
say to me first.

763
01:06:32.454 --> 01:06:33.869
This!

764
01:06:54.329 --> 01:06:55.453
That's enough.

765
01:08:23.829 --> 01:08:25.370
Ain't they supposed to
burn up or something?

766
01:08:35.037 --> 01:08:36.995
Oh, fuck.

767
01:08:48.745 --> 01:08:50.619
Now let's kill that fucking band!

768
01:08:51.662 --> 01:08:52.786
I can do that.

769
01:08:55.578 --> 01:08:57.536
Fuck you, everybody. Good night!

770
01:09:02.079 --> 01:09:03.078
Fuckers.

771
01:09:20.954 --> 01:09:21.953
Hey, buddy.

772
01:09:24.745 --> 01:09:27.078
I'm sorry I fucked things up, Richie.

773
01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:36.036
You would've liked it in El Rey.
You would've...

774
01:09:38.079 --> 01:09:39.286
You would've found peace.

775
01:09:43.079 --> 01:09:44.452
I love you, buddy.

776
01:09:47.495 --> 01:09:48.619
I love you too, Seth.

777
01:10:02.412 --> 01:10:04.577
You touch my brother with that stake, biker,

778
01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:06.203
and vampires aren't gonna
have to suck your blood.

779
01:10:06.287 --> 01:10:07.786
They'll be able to lick it up off the floor.

780
01:10:07.829 --> 01:10:08.995
He's not your brother anymore.

781
01:10:09.079 --> 01:10:12.327
That's a matter of opinion
and I don't give a fuck about yours.

782
01:10:12.453 --> 01:10:16.286
Don't be a fool! He'll kill us all.

783
01:10:16.328 --> 01:10:18.120
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

784
01:10:18.662 --> 01:10:20.494
Let's go. Move, move.

785
01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:38.703
Hold him down.

786
01:10:45.079 --> 01:10:46.245
Richie.

787
01:10:47.537 --> 01:10:51.536
Here is the peace in death,
that I could not give you in life.

788
01:11:07.829 --> 01:11:08.953
Fuck!

789
01:11:19.954 --> 01:11:22.786
Seth, are you okay?

790
01:11:23.079 --> 01:11:25.619
I'm peachy, Kate. The world is my oyster.

791
01:11:30.121 --> 01:11:31.869
Except for the fact
that I just...

792
01:11:33.829 --> 01:11:37.452
I just rammed a wooden stake
into my brother's chest,

793
01:11:37.495 --> 01:11:39.536
because he turned into a vampire.

794
01:11:40.121 --> 01:11:42.161
Even though I don't believe in vampires.

795
01:11:42.578 --> 01:11:45.703
Aside from that unfortunate business,

796
01:11:46.787 --> 01:11:48.244
everything is hunky-dory.

797
01:11:51.662 --> 01:11:54.577
- I'm really, really sorry.
- Bullshit! Bullshit!

798
01:11:56.453 --> 01:11:58.911
If it were up to you,
if you had half a chance,

799
01:11:59.121 --> 01:12:00.869
you would feed us to those fucks.

800
01:12:01.037 --> 01:12:02.244
Then why didn't I?

801
01:12:06.578 --> 01:12:09.536
I'm sorry you lost your brother.
I'm sorry he's dead.

802
01:12:09.954 --> 01:12:11.786
I'm sorry everybody's dead.

803
01:12:12.203 --> 01:12:16.452
But if we're gonna get out of this,
we need you clean and sober and thinking.

804
01:12:16.537 --> 01:12:17.619
Not drunk.

805
01:12:21.787 --> 01:12:22.953
What is that?

806
01:12:23.203 --> 01:12:27.244
Don't know. First I thought it was just birds.

807
01:12:30.829 --> 01:12:31.869
Bats.

808
01:12:38.745 --> 01:12:39.786
Gimme a hand.

809
01:13:28.079 --> 01:13:29.119
No!

810
01:13:31.996 --> 01:13:33.078
Hey!

811
01:13:48.829 --> 01:13:50.327
I'm sorry.

812
01:13:51.453 --> 01:13:52.536
Come on!

813
01:14:02.495 --> 01:14:06.452
We'll take care of this mess,
you go stake the rest of those ugly fucks.

814
01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:07.661
Way ahead of you.

815
01:14:09.245 --> 01:14:12.119
- Watch your step. What's your name, girlie?
- Kate. What's yours?

816
01:14:12.161 --> 01:14:14.285
- Sex Machine. Pleased to meet you, Kate.
- You, too.

817
01:15:39.286 --> 01:15:42.452
- ls everybody okay?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

818
01:15:47.787 --> 01:15:49.828
Does anybody know
what's going on here?

819
01:15:49.912 --> 01:15:51.119
I know what's going on.

820
01:15:51.662 --> 01:15:53.536
We've got a bunch
of fucking vampires out there,

821
01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:56.285
trying to get in here
and suck our fucking blood,

822
01:15:56.370 --> 01:15:57.994
and that's it, plain and simple.

823
01:15:58.078 --> 01:16:00.911
And I don't wanna hear anything about
"I don't believe in vampires."

824
01:16:00.953 --> 01:16:05.703
Because I don't fucking believe in vampires,
but I believe in my own two eyes,

825
01:16:05.912 --> 01:16:08.536
and what I saw is fucking vampires.

826
01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:12.327
Now, do we all agree that what
we are dealing with is vampires?

827
01:16:12.953 --> 01:16:15.244
- Yes.
- You, too, preacher?

828
01:16:15.953 --> 01:16:19.285
I don't believe in vampires,
but I believe in what I saw.

829
01:16:19.370 --> 01:16:22.494
Good for you. All right, now that we all
agree that we're dealing with vampires,

830
01:16:22.578 --> 01:16:24.119
what do we know about vampires?

831
01:16:24.829 --> 01:16:26.994
Crosses hurt vampires. Do we have a cross?

832
01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:28.911
In the motor home.

833
01:16:28.953 --> 01:16:29.994
In other words, no.

834
01:16:30.078 --> 01:16:33.327
Wait a second. I mean, just look around.
We got crosses all over the place.

835
01:16:33.412 --> 01:16:36.244
All you gotta do is put two sticks together
and you got a cross.

836
01:16:36.286 --> 01:16:38.786
Yeah, he's right.
Peter Cushing does that all the time.

837
01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:42.077
Okay, I'll buy that.
So, we got crosses covered. What else?

838
01:16:42.286 --> 01:16:44.910
Wooden stakes in the heart
have been working pretty good so far.

839
01:16:45.036 --> 01:16:50.285
And garlic, sunlight, holy water. I'm not sure.

840
01:16:50.412 --> 01:16:52.452
Doesn't silver have
something to do with vampires?

841
01:16:52.537 --> 01:16:53.786
That's WereWolves.

842
01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:55.327
I know silver bullets are WereWolves.

843
01:16:55.412 --> 01:16:57.703
But I'm sure silver has
something to do with vampires.

844
01:16:57.787 --> 01:16:59.828
Well, does anybody have any silver?

845
01:17:02.787 --> 01:17:04.452
Okay. Then, who cares?

846
01:17:05.787 --> 01:17:08.369
Has anybody here read
a real book about vampires,

847
01:17:08.453 --> 01:17:10.828
or are We just remembering
what some movie said?

848
01:17:11.328 --> 01:17:14.327
- I mean, a real book.
- You mean like a Time-Life book?

849
01:17:14.453 --> 01:17:17.244
I take it the answer's no. Okay, then.

850
01:17:17.286 --> 01:17:19.536
What do We know about these vampires?

851
01:17:19.662 --> 01:17:23.202
We know they got superhuman strength,
but We can hurt them.

852
01:17:23.286 --> 01:17:24.868
- Yeah.
- Another thing, though is

853
01:17:24.953 --> 01:17:26.952
if you're gonna drive
a chair leg through a human,

854
01:17:27.286 --> 01:17:29.285
you better be one strong son of a bitch.

855
01:17:29.370 --> 01:17:33.035
I mean, the human body is
one rough, tough machine.

856
01:17:33.286 --> 01:17:36.619
But these vamps, these vamps,
they have soft bodies.

857
01:17:36.745 --> 01:17:39.994
The texture of their skin is soft
and they're mushier.

858
01:17:40.078 --> 01:17:41.536
You can push shit right through them.

859
01:17:41.745 --> 01:17:44.952
Conceivably, if you hit one hard enough,
take their head right off.

860
01:17:47.829 --> 01:17:51.994
Actually, our best Weapon
against these satanic cocksuckers,

861
01:17:52.787 --> 01:17:53.786
is this man.

862
01:17:55.412 --> 01:17:56.619
He's a preacher.

863
01:17:57.370 --> 01:17:59.910
As far as God's concerned,
We might as Well all be a piece of shit,

864
01:17:59.953 --> 01:18:01.452
but he's one of the boys.

865
01:18:01.869 --> 01:18:04.827
Only one problem,
his faith isn't what it used to be.

866
01:18:09.704 --> 01:18:11.411
I've had enough of your taunts.

867
01:18:13.036 --> 01:18:16.411
I'm not taunting you, Jacob. We need you.

868
01:18:17.578 --> 01:18:21.202
A faithless preacher doesn't mean shit to us.

869
01:18:24.828 --> 01:18:29.744
A servant of God can take a cross
and shove it up these monsters' asses.

870
01:18:29.787 --> 01:18:34.369
A servant of God can bless the tap Water
and make it a Weapon.

871
01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:38.244
Jacob,

872
01:18:39.328 --> 01:18:40.994
I know why you lost your faith.

873
01:18:43.953 --> 01:18:49.285
How could holiness exist if your wife can be
taken away from you and your children?

874
01:18:51.203 --> 01:18:53.952
NoW, I've always said
that God can kiss my ass.

875
01:18:53.995 --> 01:18:57.369
But I just changed
my lifetime tune about 30 minutes ago.

876
01:18:57.786 --> 01:19:01.411
'Cause I know that whatever is out there
trying to get in,

877
01:19:01.453 --> 01:19:03.744
is pure evil, straight from hell.

878
01:19:03.786 --> 01:19:07.411
And if there is a hell,
and those sons of bitches are from it,

879
01:19:07.453 --> 01:19:10.452
then there has got to be a heaven, Jacob.
There's gotta be!

880
01:19:15.578 --> 01:19:16.785
So, which are you?

881
01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:20.494
Are you a faithless preacher,

882
01:19:20.578 --> 01:19:23.244
or are you a mean
motherfucking servant of God?

883
01:19:33.370 --> 01:19:39.577
I'm a mean
servant of God.

884
01:19:46.828 --> 01:19:49.619
I don't know if I can take
much more of that noise.

885
01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:52.536
Sure you can.

886
01:19:54.662 --> 01:19:57.285
You can take it because you got no choice.

887
01:19:58.744 --> 01:20:02.952
How'd you like to spend 24 hours
of it lying in some muddy ditch,

888
01:20:03.537 --> 01:20:07.577
with nothing but the rotten corpses
of your friends to keep you company?

889
01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:09.994
What are you talking about?

890
01:20:14.953 --> 01:20:16.411
I was in 'Nam.

891
01:20:17.286 --> 01:20:18.577
Back in '72.

892
01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:22.785
I Was trapped behind enemy lines,

893
01:20:23.495 --> 01:20:25.577
with my entire squad dead.

894
01:20:27.453 --> 01:20:29.160
They thought they had killed everyone.

895
01:20:30.869 --> 01:20:33.452
Except for me, they Was right.

896
01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:36.285
But it Wasn't for their lack of trying.

897
01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:38.369
A grenade,

898
01:20:39.328 --> 01:20:41.577
blew up right beside me.

899
01:20:43.786 --> 01:20:45.244
That's why I'm so pretty.

900
01:20:46.453 --> 01:20:50.035
And they start pushing
all them bodies in on top of me.

901
01:20:50.453 --> 01:20:52.619
And all I could do, Was lay there.

902
01:20:52.911 --> 01:20:54.119
Play possum.

903
01:20:55.078 --> 01:20:57.619
Listen to the enemy joke, laugh,

904
01:20:57.953 --> 01:21:01.660
hour after hour after hour.

905
01:21:11.661 --> 01:21:14.244
Sex Machine.

906
01:21:14.286 --> 01:21:18.660
Kill them.

907
01:21:20.828 --> 01:21:22.702
So I finally climbed out of this hole

908
01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:26.660
and I sneaked up on the enemy
while he Was sleeping.

909
01:21:27.537 --> 01:21:31.868
And I killed one, two, three, four, five...

910
01:22:03.286 --> 01:22:05.077
When I came to my senses,

911
01:22:06.953 --> 01:22:11.411
I realized I had killed an entire VC squad.

912
01:22:12.036 --> 01:22:13.202
Single-handed.

913
01:22:13.953 --> 01:22:16.702
There was blood

914
01:22:17.828 --> 01:22:22.452
and chunks of yellow flesh,
clinging to my bayonet.

915
01:22:27.619 --> 01:22:31.244
To this day, I don't remember...

916
01:22:33.078 --> 01:22:35.618
Get him off of me! Get off of me!

917
01:22:35.661 --> 01:22:37.868
Please! Get him off!

918
01:22:42.495 --> 01:22:43.660
No!

919
01:22:51.328 --> 01:22:52.369
Dad!

920
01:23:06.619 --> 01:23:09.910
He fucking bit me. He fucking bit me.

921
01:23:11.370 --> 01:23:13.035
What are you gonna do about it?

922
01:23:14.036 --> 01:23:15.285
Come on, Sex Machine.

923
01:23:26.328 --> 01:23:29.285
Oh, shit!

924
01:23:39.786 --> 01:23:42.369
Get up! Get up! Up! Come on!

925
01:23:53.995 --> 01:23:56.411
Go! Fuck!

926
01:24:06.911 --> 01:24:09.910
Wait, We have to go back for my father.

927
01:24:09.953 --> 01:24:11.702
Your dad's dead, Kate.

928
01:24:57.703 --> 01:24:58.994
He is the light.

929
01:24:59.911 --> 01:25:03.202
The people who Walk

930
01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:05.618
in the darkness

931
01:25:07.494 --> 01:25:09.868
have seen the light!

932
01:25:34.619 --> 01:25:36.285
Open the door!

933
01:25:37.869 --> 01:25:39.244
Open the door!

934
01:25:43.036 --> 01:25:44.202
Go! Go!

935
01:25:44.577 --> 01:25:45.827
Oh, Daddy!

936
01:25:46.494 --> 01:25:47.952
Jacob, are you bit?

937
01:25:50.286 --> 01:25:51.368
Yeah.

938
01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:55.576
Motherfuck. Motherfucking vampires!

939
01:25:55.619 --> 01:25:59.785
I'm gonna kill every last one of
you godless, fucking pieces of shit!

940
01:25:59.828 --> 01:26:01.660
You bet you are
and I'm gonna help you do it.

941
01:26:02.452 --> 01:26:04.077
But We ain't got much time.

942
01:26:04.369 --> 01:26:07.451
- You're gonna be okay, aren't you?
- No, I'm not.

943
01:26:07.703 --> 01:26:10.702
I've been bit.
In fact, I'm already dead.

944
01:26:11.828 --> 01:26:13.035
NoW...

945
01:26:14.536 --> 01:26:17.952
I'd say in the next 20 or 30 minutes,
our friends outside will bust in this door

946
01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:21.285
and I'll probably turn into a vampire
within the hour.

947
01:26:21.369 --> 01:26:22.827
NoW, you have two choices.

948
01:26:22.911 --> 01:26:25.952
You can Wait for me to turn,
then deal with me.

949
01:26:26.286 --> 01:26:28.202
Or We can kick open that door,

950
01:26:28.619 --> 01:26:32.368
and the four of us can go at 'em,
hit 'em with everything We have.

951
01:26:32.995 --> 01:26:35.160
But if We're gonna go at 'em,
We gotta go at 'em noW.

952
01:26:38.577 --> 01:26:39.785
What's this stuff?

953
01:26:40.995 --> 01:26:43.202
My guess is this little dive

954
01:26:43.286 --> 01:26:46.535
has been feeding on bikers
and truckers for a long time.

955
01:26:47.286 --> 01:26:49.410
This is probably the shipments
they stole off the trucks.

956
01:26:49.452 --> 01:26:51.702
I say, let's tear this place apart for Weapons.

957
01:26:51.786 --> 01:26:53.994
So when they burst through that door,
We'll make 'em wish they never did.

958
01:26:54.078 --> 01:26:55.285
I don't care about living or dying anymore.

959
01:26:55.369 --> 01:26:58.493
I just Wanna send as many of
these devils back to hell, as I can.

960
01:26:58.786 --> 01:26:59.868
Amen.

961
01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:05.160
Loving God, bless this Water

962
01:28:05.285 --> 01:28:09.368
and give us your protection and strength
in this, our darkest hour. Amen.

963
01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:21.493
Before We go any further,
I need you three to promise me something.

964
01:28:22.244 --> 01:28:25.284
I'll fight with you till the bitter end,
but when I turn into one of them,

965
01:28:26.078 --> 01:28:27.827
I Won't be Jacob anymore.

966
01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:30.868
I'll be a lapdog of Satan.

967
01:28:31.786 --> 01:28:35.410
I Want you three to promise you'll
take me down, no different from the rest.

968
01:28:36.161 --> 01:28:37.326
I promise, Jacob.

969
01:28:38.369 --> 01:28:39.910
Kate? Scott?

970
01:28:41.327 --> 01:28:42.451
I promise.

971
01:28:43.661 --> 01:28:45.994
- Scott?
- Yeah, I promise.

972
01:28:49.285 --> 01:28:50.868
Why don't I believe you?

973
01:28:53.953 --> 01:28:55.451
I'm gonna ask you two again.

974
01:28:56.661 --> 01:28:58.994
Then I Want you to swear to God,

975
01:28:59.369 --> 01:29:01.035
that you'll kill me!

976
01:29:02.327 --> 01:29:06.284
If you don't,
I'm gonna just kill myself right noW.

977
01:29:06.619 --> 01:29:09.910
NoW, since you need me,
I think you better swear!

978
01:29:10.953 --> 01:29:16.785
Kate, do you swear to God
that when I become one of the undead,

979
01:29:17.536 --> 01:29:18.785
you'll kill me?

980
01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:22.284
Kate!

981
01:29:22.786 --> 01:29:25.410
We don't have much time,
so I'm only giving you to the count of five.

982
01:29:25.452 --> 01:29:29.576
One, two, three, four...

983
01:29:29.619 --> 01:29:32.451
Okay, all right! I promise I'll do it!

984
01:29:34.327 --> 01:29:36.451
Good girl. NoW, Scott,

985
01:29:37.036 --> 01:29:39.660
We have even less time,
so I'm giving you the count of three.

986
01:29:39.744 --> 01:29:42.119
- One...
- No, you don't believe in suicide.

987
01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:46.201
It's not suicide, if you're already dead. Two.

988
01:29:46.619 --> 01:29:48.994
Okay! Okay.

989
01:29:49.953 --> 01:29:53.451
I'll kill you when you change.
I swear to God, in Jesus Christ's name.

990
01:29:53.536 --> 01:29:54.535
Thank you, Son.

991
01:29:54.953 --> 01:29:59.326
Okay, vampire killers,
let's kill some fucking vampires.

992
01:30:20.119 --> 01:30:23.827
Those who walk in the darkness
have seen the light.

993
01:30:23.911 --> 01:30:26.618
In the darkness have seen the light.

994
01:30:28.285 --> 01:30:30.660
In the darkness, the light.

995
01:30:49.452 --> 01:30:52.910
Those who walk in the darkness
have seen the light.

996
01:30:55.661 --> 01:30:57.201
Kill 'em all!

997
01:32:24.244 --> 01:32:26.118
Come on! Come on!

998
01:34:25.285 --> 01:34:26.284
Dad?

999
01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:38.867
Dad! No, Dad!

1000
01:34:39.077 --> 01:34:40.618
Dad! Dad!

1001
01:34:53.619 --> 01:34:55.826
I swear to God, in Jesus Christ's name.

1002
01:34:57.786 --> 01:34:59.118
Oh, my God!

1003
01:35:00.619 --> 01:35:02.159
Fight noW, cry later!

1004
01:35:07.411 --> 01:35:11.743
Get the fuck off! Get off! Get off! Get 'em off!

1005
01:35:26.035 --> 01:35:27.284
Kill me, Kate.

1006
01:35:29.827 --> 01:35:31.451
Just kill me, Kate.

1007
01:35:33.285 --> 01:35:34.451
I can't.

1008
01:35:53.577 --> 01:35:56.951
- How many bullets you have?
- I don't know. Not many.

1009
01:35:57.577 --> 01:36:00.284
When you run out, start cold-cocking 'em.
Make 'em sing for their supper.

1010
01:36:11.536 --> 01:36:14.702
Seth, should I save the last bullets for us?

1011
01:36:15.327 --> 01:36:18.034
No. Use it on the next fuck
that tries to bite you.

1012
01:36:28.369 --> 01:36:30.660
Shoot more holes. Shoot more holes!

1013
01:36:37.536 --> 01:36:39.451
- Perfect.
- They can't go into the light.

1014
01:36:39.827 --> 01:36:43.034
Perfect. All right, go.

1015
01:36:43.119 --> 01:36:44.951
Hey, Seth, don't leave me.

1016
01:36:47.452 --> 01:36:50.118
Come here. Come here. Come on!

1017
01:36:51.785 --> 01:36:52.784
Come on, you!

1018
01:36:55.952 --> 01:36:57.118
Come here, you fucks!

1019
01:36:59.119 --> 01:37:01.784
Hello?
I'm looking for my friend Seth.

1020
01:37:02.285 --> 01:37:05.118
Carlos! Kick in the door!

1021
01:37:15.577 --> 01:37:16.618
Go!

1022
01:37:17.577 --> 01:37:18.993
Son of a bitch.

1023
01:37:49.536 --> 01:37:51.284
What the fuck Was goin' on in there?

1024
01:37:56.910 --> 01:37:58.535
What's the matter with you? Are you crazy?

1025
01:37:58.619 --> 01:38:03.951
Why, out of all the godforsaken shit holes
in Mexico do We have to meet here?

1026
01:38:05.619 --> 01:38:07.618
One place is just as good as another.

1027
01:38:09.785 --> 01:38:10.993
You ever been here before?

1028
01:38:12.994 --> 01:38:16.076
No. I drove by it a couple times.

1029
01:38:16.452 --> 01:38:18.701
It's a rowdy place.
It's out in the middle of nowhere.

1030
01:38:18.785 --> 01:38:21.076
There'll be no cops.
And it's open from dusk till dawn.

1031
01:38:21.119 --> 01:38:23.451
Didn't you say you Wanted to
meet in the morning? Here We are.

1032
01:38:23.494 --> 01:38:26.993
Well, since you just picked this
place out of a hat, my brother is dead,

1033
01:38:27.077 --> 01:38:30.451
that girl's entire fucking family is dead!

1034
01:38:33.994 --> 01:38:35.118
What Were they? Psychos?

1035
01:38:35.952 --> 01:38:37.867
They look like psychos?
Is that what they looked like?

1036
01:38:37.952 --> 01:38:38.951
They Were vampires.

1037
01:38:39.035 --> 01:38:42.284
Psychos do not explode
when sunlight hits them.

1038
01:38:42.327 --> 01:38:44.118
I don't give a fuck how crazy they are!

1039
01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:49.451
Seth, how can I make it up to you?

1040
01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:52.993
You can't make it up to me, Carlos.
You can't do it.

1041
01:38:53.327 --> 01:38:54.951
Can't make it up!

1042
01:38:58.910 --> 01:39:03.451
15% instead of 30% for my stay
in El Rey, that's a good start.

1043
01:39:06.119 --> 01:39:07.159
Twenty-eight.

1044
01:39:07.952 --> 01:39:09.701
My brother's gone.
You understand that?

1045
01:39:09.785 --> 01:39:12.784
He's gone and he's not coming back
and that is your fault.

1046
01:39:16.411 --> 01:39:17.535
Twenty.

1047
01:39:20.536 --> 01:39:21.701
- Twenty-five.
- Twenty-five.

1048
01:39:24.077 --> 01:39:26.535
Kate. Go to the RV, get the suitcase.

1049
01:39:32.494 --> 01:39:33.784
You look like hell.

1050
01:39:35.618 --> 01:39:37.951
You want a cold beer?
I got some in the car.

1051
01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:41.951
Come on, they're cold. Huh?

1052
01:39:42.576 --> 01:39:44.118
I got Mexican and domestic.

1053
01:40:02.119 --> 01:40:04.326
- So, how do you like the car?
- It's all right.

1054
01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:08.909
I said "like new." This is a '90.

1055
01:40:09.244 --> 01:40:13.201
Hey, it is new, cabron.
Belonged to a drug dealer friend of mine.

1056
01:40:13.369 --> 01:40:15.784
Hey, he only drove it,
like, 14 times in five years.

1057
01:40:15.827 --> 01:40:17.159
It's like new, I swear to God.

1058
01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:23.909
- So, what do I do, follow you?
- Yeah, follow me.

1059
01:40:23.952 --> 01:40:24.993
All right, let's do it.

1060
01:40:34.119 --> 01:40:35.118
I'm sorry.

1061
01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:49.410
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

1062
01:40:58.451 --> 01:41:00.492
- I'll see ya.
- Seth?

1063
01:41:03.952 --> 01:41:05.534
You need some company?

1064
01:41:09.369 --> 01:41:11.826
Kate, do you know where I'm going?
Do you know what El Rey is?

1065
01:41:14.493 --> 01:41:16.410
- No.
- Hey, Seth.

1066
01:41:18.369 --> 01:41:19.784
It's time to go.

1067
01:41:22.327 --> 01:41:23.617
Go home, Kate.

1068
01:41:27.451 --> 01:41:29.909
I may be a bastard,
but I'm not a fucking bastard.
