1
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,998
(small clank)

2
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,129
(low growl)

3
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,132
Lunch.

4
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:41,971
(beeping)

5
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,892
Hey. Hey, hey.

6
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,561
Come here. Take a look at this.

7
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:53,482
- What is it?
- It's a data stream from PS12.

8
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:57,528
- Where is she?
- Right above sector 14.

9
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:59,739
There isn't anything in sector 14.

10
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,824
There is now.

11
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,665
(grunts)

12
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,344
(phone rings)

13
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:35,066
- Hello?
- (man) Miss Woods. Pleasure to speak to you.

14
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,693
- Who is this?
- My name's Maxwell Stafford.

15
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,237
I represent Weyland Industries.

16
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,784
- Let me guess. He's suing us again?
- You misunderstand.

17
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:50,915
Mr Weyland has offered to fund your
foundation for a year, if you'll meet with him.

18
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,458
When?

19
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,085
Tomorrow.

20
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:59,757
Tomorrow's gonna be a problem.
Take me a week to get back to the world.

21
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:03,177
Yes, I told Mr Weyland that.

22
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,888
He said he didn't have a week.

23
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,435
(Latin American music)

24
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,574
We must be right on top of it.

25
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,929
What is it, Sebastian?

26
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,780
(man) Early 1950s, I'd say.

27
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,534
Hey, Juan, we are almost there.

28
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:13,914
According to you, the Teotihuacans'
final gift to their dying king was a Pepsi.

29
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,250
Give me one more month. Please.

30
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,794
I'm bringing in another team.

31
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,629
What?

32
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:24,717
Without a crew and a new permit,
we're out of business.

33
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:29,805
Hold the team together for two days.
I'll go to Mexico City and talk to the bank.

34
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,057
I'll get us more money.

35
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:35,352
(Max) I might be able to help you
accomplish that, Professor.

36
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,898
Do I know you?

37
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:42,735
In exchange for a little of your time.

38
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,506
(beeping)

39
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:11,055
Oh, I'm sorry.
I should've, um, switched the flash off.

40
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,808
There's your magazine. Excuse me.

41
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,810
That's OK.

42
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:19,271
I'm documenting the trip for my boys.
This is them.

43
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,774
Jacob and Scotty.

44
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,610
Would you mind taking a picture?
Thank you.

45
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:28,989
Just wanna show them
that their dad wasn't always so boring.

46
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,325
- Smile.
- OK.

47
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,704
- There you go.
- Thank you.

48
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,707
I'm Graeme Miller. I'm a chemical engineer.

49
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:42,086
Alexa Woods,
environmental technician and guide.

50
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,005
- Do you work for Weyland?
- Oh, no.

51
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:49,426
No, I, um... I split my time between
working for a small environmental group

52
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,805
and taking scientists
on expeditions on the ice.

53
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,308
(man) Lex. Buckle up.
We're gonna hit some turbulence.

54
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,894
(Lex) Thanks, Jack.

55
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,564
- Is he a friend of yours?
- (Lex) Of my dad's.

56
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,732
He trained most of the pilots here.

57
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:07,653
- Just passed the PSR.
- Oh, damn. I wish I'd got a picture.

58
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,656
- Of what?
- Um, the PSR.

59
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:14,493
I wish he'd called it out before we passed it.

60
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,997
The PSR is the point of safe return.

61
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:22,251
It means we've used up half our fuel,
so we can't turn back.

62
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:28,424
Right, but if something went wrong,
we could... land, presumably.

63
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,885
- We could ditch.
- Yeah. Ditch.

64
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:35,097
But the temperature of the water
would kill us in three minutes.

65
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:57,119
- Weyland's cheque cleared.
- Good.

66
00:08:57,162 --> 00:09:00,331
You know what? We're gonna listen
to whatever he has to say,

67
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:04,627
we nod, we smile, and we politely decline
whatever offer he makes.

68
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,171
Take the money
and we head back to Mexico.

69
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,256
- Right.
- Right.

70
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:14,970
(bleeping / turns engine on)

71
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,722
(engine off)

72
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:23,604
- Having fun?
- Yeah. This is quite an adventure.

73
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:27,107
My kids won't believe this.
Would you mind taking a picture?

74
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:31,278
- You have to hold that down till the flash...
- You're kidding.

75
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:35,532
Get off,
or you'll be wearing your ass for a hat!

76
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,326
All right, OK, sure.

77
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,620
Nice team spirit.

78
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,332
Keep the beakers away from the gear.

79
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:48,128
What does he mean, "beaker"?

80
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:53,050
That's what they call scientists out here.
You know, Beaker - like in The Muppet Show.

81
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:56,929
Everybody, please, your attention.

82
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,019
Mr Weyland.

83
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,230
(footsteps)

84
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:21,829
Seven days ago, one of my satellites
over Antarctica hunting for mineral deposits

85
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:27,209
discovered a sudden heat bloom
beneath the earth, which outlined this.

86
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,962
The red lines indicate solid walls.

87
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:36,468
Through thermal mapping, we've generated
a three-dimensional image of the structure.

88
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:42,808
It's massive, containing hundreds of rooms,
all built around a central core.

89
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,395
My experts tell me it's a pyramid.

90
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:51,483
What they can't agree on
is who built it and when.

91
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:55,821
One expert tells me this has features
reminiscent of the Aztecs.

92
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,615
Another tells me it's probably Cambodian.

93
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:03,162
What they all agree on is that
the smooth side is definitively Egyptian.

94
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:06,540
- I think your experts are right.
- Which one?

95
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:10,294
- All of them.
- Meaning what, exactly?

96
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:15,549
(Sebastian) This pyramid contains
the features of all three cultures.

97
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,803
This might be the first pyramid ever built.

98
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:24,558
- But built by whom?
- By the first civilisation.

99
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,978
(Weyland) Thank you.

100
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:31,190
But how could anyone possibly
build a pyramid out here?

101
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,193
Ancient maps show Antarctica free of ice.

102
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:39,490
- It's likely the continent was once habitable.
- (Miller) I can't tell you who built it.

103
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:43,035
But if I could take a sample from it,
I can tell you how old it is.

104
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,622
Dr Miller, I'm offering
to put you right next to this thing.

105
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:50,501
- Uh, what caused the heat bloom?
- I don't know.

106
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:54,046
- Where exactly on the ice is this?
- Bouvetøya Island.

107
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:58,008
But it's not on the ice. It's 2,000ft below it.

108
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,806
- Mr Quinn?
- (man) Mr Stafford.

109
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:08,602
You're looking at the best drilling team in the
world. We'll chew to that depth in seven days.

110
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,730
Add three weeks on top of that
to train everyone here.

111
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,858
We don't have that kind of time, Ms Woods.

112
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,736
I'm not the only one
with a satellite over Antarctica.

113
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,322
Others will be here soon.

114
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:25,035
Maybe I wasn't clear.
No one in this room is ready for this trip.

115
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,538
That's why I asked you here.

116
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:32,417
Bouvetøya is one of the world's most isolated
places. The nearest land is 1 ,000 miles away.

117
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:37,214
- There's no help if we run into trouble.
- You're right. It's a no-man's-land.

118
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,133
But the train has left the station.

119
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:44,388
And I think I speak
for everyone aboard this ship.

120
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,306
This is worth the risk.

121
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,649
(sighs)

122
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,277
Find another guide.

123
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:18,630
I've spoken with Mr Weyland.
Money's been wired to your account.

124
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:22,050
Chopper's refuelling to fly you home.

125
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,721
Who'd you get?

126
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:29,099
Gerald Murdoch.

127
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:35,105
- Come in.
- Murdoch has two seasons of ice time.

128
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,982
He's not ready.

129
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:40,068
- Don't worry about it.
- What about Paul Woodman?

130
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:43,447
- We called him.
- He gave the same bullshit answer you did.

131
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,990
"Bullshit"?

132
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:52,789
What I told you in there wasn't bullshit. If you
rush this, people will get hurt. Maybe die.

133
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:56,585
I don't understand.
We're not asking you to take us up Everest.

134
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:00,631
We need you to take us from the ship
to the pyramid, and back. That's it.

135
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,884
- What about inside the pyramid?
- Don't worry about that.

136
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:08,472
Once we're on the site, we have the best
technology and experts that money can buy.

137
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,474
- Is this new?
- It's the latest.

138
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,437
Mr Weyland, when I lead my team
I don't ever leave my team.

139
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,731
I admire your passion.

140
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,902
I wish you were going with us.

141
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,237
You're making a mistake.

142
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,665
(Miller) Ah, it's in the upper atmosphere.

143
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,251
Streams of protons
and electrons from the sun

144
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:43,006
being deflected by the earth's magnetic
field, causing a solar radiation storm.

145
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:47,928
Shackleton called Antarctica
"the last great journey left to man".

146
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:51,932
It's the one place left in the world
that no one owns.

147
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,142
It's completely free.

148
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:59,815
Me, I'm sort of partial to the penguins.

149
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,446
I wish you'd reconsider coming with us, Lex.

150
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:10,701
Come on, don't make me pull out
pictures of my kids again.

151
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,911
Your kids aren't that cute.

152
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:17,165
What if we got pictures
of other people's kids?

153
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,043
- Want my advice?
- Mm-hm.

154
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,838
Stay on the boat.

155
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,341
(Sebastian) OK.
Let me ask you something.

156
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,886
Do we stand a better chance
of surviving with you

157
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:33,473
or with the number-two choice?

158
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,352
Miss Woods, your helicopter's refuelled.

159
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:40,063
They're waiting for you.

160
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,798
(Lex) Everybody, listen up!

161
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:50,175
Gather round.

162
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:54,888
Told you she'd stay.
She can't resist my animal magnetism.

163
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,307
Laugh it up, Miller. Laugh it up.

164
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,975
Gentlemen?

165
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:04,481
It is my job to keep you alive
on this expedition,

166
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,900
and I need your help to do that.

167
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:11,363
Since I don't have time to properly train you,
I'm laying down three rules.

168
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:15,992
One. No one goes anywhere alone, ever.

169
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,245
Two.

170
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:22,958
Everyone must maintain
constant communication.

171
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,545
Three. Unexpected things are gonna happen.

172
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:29,965
When they do, no one tries to be a hero.

173
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:36,221
Understood?

174
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,932
- Yes, ma'am.
- Good.

175
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:47,691
Seven seasons on the ice
and I've never seen a gun save someone's life.

176
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:51,486
- I don't plan on using it.
- Then why bring it?

177
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,780
Same principle as a condom.

178
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:58,410
I'd rather have one and not need it
than need it and not have one.

179
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,830
I'm glad that you decided to stay.

180
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:07,169
Move the trucks out on the ice.

181
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:10,130
Move that. OK, let's move.

182
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,396
- (Lex) What's with the bottle cap?
- What?

183
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,274
What's with the bottle cap?

184
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,734
Oh.

185
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:34,237
This is a... a valuable archaeological find.

186
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:46,666
When I was a kid growing up in Italy,
you know what they call a moon that big?

187
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:47,918
Hm.

188
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,253
La luna del cacciatore.

189
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:54,132
(slowly) La luna del cacciatore.

190
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:56,092
Brava.

191
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:59,262
- What's that?
- Hunter's moon.

192
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,932
- Hunter's moon.
- Mm-hm.

193
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:04,893
Mm.

194
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,952
(Quinn) Hold it, guys.

195
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:27,958
- (whistles) Keep those engines running!
- (man) Set it down.

196
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,378
Hey, move over a little further. Connors.

197
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,982
It's an abandoned whaling station.

198
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:57,988
According to your satellite imagery,
the pyramid is located directly beneath it.

199
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,754
All right, bring it up. Come on. Come on.

200
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,507
Spread out.

201
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:22,929
We'll use this place as a base camp. Mr Quinn,
begin drilling operations as soon as you can.

202
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:26,224
I'm on it. OK, guys, let's move out.

203
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,687
- What are these?
- Whale bones.

204
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:20,737
This station was abandoned in 1904.
Everyone just disappeared overnight.

205
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,865
It was a big mystery back then.

206
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,955
Oh.

207
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,960
One for National Geographic.

208
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,679
(clattering)

209
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,313
(wings flapping)

210
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,898
(squeaking)

211
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,153
(clattering)

212
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,326
(wings flapping)

213
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,337
Whoa! Lex.

214
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:04,466
- No one goes anywhere alone.
- Shh.

215
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:09,554
- There's something there. Listen. Listen.
- (wings flapping)

216
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,520
Careful. They bite.

217
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,533
(Sebastian) Hey. Over here.

218
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,993
Over here.

219
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,786
What is it?

220
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,457
Can you believe that?

221
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,886
(Quinn) It's drilled
at a perfect 30-degree angle.

222
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:54,390
- How far does it go down?
- (Weyland) All the way to the pyramid.

223
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:58,394
There it is. Clear as day.
And the same time yesterday...

224
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,565
- Nothing.
- How was it done?

225
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:07,570
- Thermal equipment of some kind.
- Like yours?

226
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,406
More advanced. Incredibly powerful.

227
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:15,578
I've never seen anything like it.

228
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:21,042
There's no team and no machine in the world
that could cut to this depth in 24 hours.

229
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:25,588
Well, the only way we're gonna know for sure
is to get down there and find out.

230
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:51,864
Look at that. Change it. Now!

231
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:57,161
OK, guys, what's taking so long?
There's a storm coming.

232
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:10,133
There's no room for sick men
on this expedition.

233
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:15,138
- My doctors tell me the worst is behind me.
- You're not a very good liar, Mr Weyland.

234
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:19,142
Stay on the ship.
We'll update you at the top of every hour.

235
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:24,063
When you get sick, you think about your life
and how you're gonna be remembered.

236
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:27,984
You know what will happen when I go?
Ten per cent fall in share prices.

237
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,570
Maybe 12. That's it.

238
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:34,324
I've heard this speech before.

239
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:38,828
My dad broke his leg
700ft from the summit of Mount Rainier.

240
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:43,249
He was like you.
He wouldn't go back or let us stop.

241
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:47,337
We reached the top,
and he opened a bottle of champagne.

242
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,343
I had my first drink with my dad at 14,400ft.

243
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:59,390
On the way down, he developed a blood clot
in his leg that travelled to his lung.

244
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:04,187
He suffered for four hours
before dying 20 minutes from the base.

245
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:09,734
You think that's the last thing
your dad remembers? The pain?

246
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:16,157
Or drinking champagne
with his daughter 14,000ft in the air?

247
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,702
I need this.

248
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,838
(Quinn) Come on, move.

249
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:18,219
Shit.

250
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,642
Mr Weyland!

251
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:27,019
Man down!

252
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,897
(woman) Get him! Somebody get him!

253
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:54,630
Move it!

254
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,466
Now!

255
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:32,186
I don't understand it.
No equipment. No sign of another team.

256
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,355
(exhales)

257
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,650
Well, that tunnel didn't dig itself.

258
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:43,239
(Max) Move it.
Connors, get those lights up.

259
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,658
(Connors) We have power.

260
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:23,112
Congratulations, Mr Weyland.

261
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:27,450
Looks like you'll be
leaving your mark after all.

262
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,080
Thank you. Thank you.

263
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,416
Thank you all for this.

264
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:39,253
Let's make history.

265
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:49,425
(Sebastian) Thomas.

266
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,511
(Thomas) What is it?

267
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:57,266
- I recognise the Egyptian...
- The second symbol is Aztec.

268
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:01,062
Pre-conquest era. The third is Cambodian.

269
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:04,899
Then you were right.
The pyramid contains all three cultures.

270
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:11,864
- (Sebastian) That's what it looks like.
- "You may... choose... to enter."

271
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:15,618
"Those who choose may enter."

272
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,995
Who taught you to translate?

273
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:21,123
Funny. Kinda looked like you.

274
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:25,753
Well, it's not "choose".

275
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,630
It's "chosen".

276
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:30,800
"Only the chosen ones may enter."

277
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,652
(roaring)

278
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:54,490
Quinn, is that you out there?

279
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,584
(screams)

280
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,358
(groans)

281
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:40,786
Mikkel.

282
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,954
(roars)

283
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,687
Aargh!

284
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:26,558
(Weyland) What is all this?

285
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:30,229
(Sebastian) This is the sacrificial chamber.

286
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:36,610
(Thomas) Like the Aztecs and the Egyptians.

287
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:41,657
Whoever built this pyramid
believed in ritual sacrifice.

288
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:46,286
This is where the chosen ones
were offered to the gods.

289
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:58,841
Those that were chosen would lie here.

290
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,552
They weren't bound or tied in any way.

291
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,722
They went to die willingly.

292
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:06,890
Men and women.

293
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,270
It was considered an honour.

294
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,106
(Lex) Lucky them.

295
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,280
Oh, God!

296
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:28,495
It's incredible. The entire skull and
spinal column was removed in one piece.

297
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,123
Look at this.

298
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:34,251
Look at that. The cleanness of the cut.

299
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:39,048
Straight through the bone.
There's no abrasions, nothing.

300
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,177
(faint howling noise)

301
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:54,480
It's probably just air
moving through the tunnels.

302
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,524
Maybe.

303
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:34,770
(yells)

304
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,696
Whatever this is, it's been dead a while.

305
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,032
The bones have completely calcified.

306
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:51,662
No idea how long it's been here,
but the temperature's kept it preserved.

307
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,081
Looks like some kind of scorpion.

308
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:58,001
- No. Climate's too hostile for a scorpion.
- Ever seen anything like it?

309
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:14,101
(Thomas) "They gave their lives
so the hunt could begin."

310
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,739
What happened here?

311
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:31,410
It's common in ritual sacrifice
to take the heart of the victim.

312
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,787
That's nice.

313
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:36,915
But that's not where your heart is.

314
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:42,004
Besides, it looks like the bones
were bent straight out.

315
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:46,800
Something broke out of this body.

316
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:44,733
- (Weyland) What have you found, Max?
- It's a shaft to another level.

317
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:48,487
Looks like there's another room down there.

318
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,907
(gasps)

319
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,382
(screams)

320
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,516
- (Weyland) Let's move to that lower room.
- (Max) We're moving on, everyone.

321
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:20,018
Ms Woods.

322
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:25,065
You, stay here. Rousseau, you stay with him.
Keep a team with you.

323
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:26,900
Catalogue everything.

324
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,237
Professor.

325
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:54,386
This should be directly below
the sacrificial chamber.

326
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,854
Sebastian.

327
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,988
It's a sarcophagus.

328
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:17,659
This is the Long Count.

329
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,538
This is the Aztec calendar.

330
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:25,667
And this, it's some kind of combination lock.

331
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:29,379
"Days."

332
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,090
"Months."

333
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:34,259
"Years."

334
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,387
The dials are set for...

335
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,728
1904.

336
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:47,397
Someone opened this 100 years ago?

337
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:51,068
- What's today's date?
- October 10.

338
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:53,862
10/10/2004.

339
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,786
- Are you sure this is gonna work?
- (Sebastian) I don't know.

340
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:14,132
(loud rumbling)

341
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,593
(Lex) Back up!

342
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,908
(Sebastian) Oh, my God. Take a look at this.

343
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:09,396
- Any idea what these are?
- No.

344
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,815
- You?
- No.

345
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:16,027
- It's a good thing we brought the experts.
- Well, yeah. It is a good thing.

346
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:19,698
Cos this is like finding
Moses' DVD collection.

347
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,200
(coughing)

348
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,205
Weyland?

349
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:32,502
A little too much excitement.

350
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,339
(Lex) We've been out long enough for today.

351
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:40,969
We'll set up base camp at the whaling station
and get back at it tomorrow morning.

352
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:45,223
Well, you can go back to the base camp,
Ms Woods, but we're staying here.

353
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:49,019
No. You wanted to leave
without proper prep. We did.

354
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:54,691
You wanted to be the first here. We are.
You've claimed the find. It's yours.

355
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:58,820
Now, we move as a team,
and we're done for the day.

356
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:01,198
You heard her.

357
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:04,701
- What do you wanna do with these?
- Take them.

358
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,953
We'll run further tests on the surface.

359
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:09,831
No. No! Don't touch them.

360
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:28,391
- (Lex) Watch out!
- The doors!

361
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:30,769
The door!

362
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,040
- You OK?
- Yeah.

363
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:56,878
Slab's gotta weigh two tons.
We'll never move it.

364
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:40,964
What did you say this room was called?

365
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,342
Sacrificial chamber.

366
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:56,354
(screaming)

367
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,859
- (Lex) Rousseau.
- (Sebastian) Tommy, come in.

368
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,694
- Come in, Rousseau.
- Come in.

369
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:07,032
- (Lex) Is there anything you didn't tell me?
- Nothing. Your guess is as good as mine.

370
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:09,367
Whatever it is, we're not prepared.

371
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:13,913
We're gonna round up the rest of the team
and get to the surface. Let's move!

372
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:21,338
- What are you doing?
- My job. Yours is over.

373
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:24,841
My job is over when everyone
is back on the boat safely.

374
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:28,261
And that gun doesn't change anything.

375
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:46,738
This bearing should take us back to the
entrance. We'll regroup at the whaling station.

376
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,783
(Sebastian) What about Thomas? Rousseau?

377
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,369
- We'll find them on the way up.
- (Weyland) Max?

378
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:54,954
(Max) Stone, Verheiden. Cover our backs.

379
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:58,541
The heat bloom your satellite detected
makes more sense now.

380
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:00,502
What do you mean?

381
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:03,963
A building this sophisticated
requires an energy source.

382
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:09,302
I think that's what your satellite detected.
A power plant for this pyramid firing up.

383
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:12,389
- Preparing.
- Preparing? For what?

384
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:14,557
(Lex) Gentlemen?

385
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,022
(crunching noise / she gasps)

386
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:10,321
(gasps)

387
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,038
(screams)

388
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,398
(Max) Keep close.

389
00:49:55,868 --> 00:50:00,580
- (Lex) Recognise what's on their shoulders?
- (Sebastian) Yeah.

390
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:07,420
- We worshipped these things?
- According to this, we did.

391
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:13,676
And the artefacts you removed from
the sarcophagus seem to be their weapons.

392
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:21,768
Let's keep moving.
Only another 200 yards to the entrance.

393
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:25,021
(growling)

394
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,623
(Max) Take cover.

395
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,291
Where's Stone?

396
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:50,380
Stone!

397
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:12,860
The pyramid's shifting again.

398
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:23,162
The doors are closing. Get out.

399
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:26,541
Come on.

400
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:28,001
OK. Let's go.

401
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:30,044
Let's go. Let's go.

402
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,337
Hey!

403
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,047
Hey! Verheiden!

404
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:37,343
Verheiden!

405
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:39,679
Somebody!

406
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:42,015
Run! Let's go!

407
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,683
No!

408
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,852
Quickly!

409
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:49,230
No! No!

410
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:09,083
I hit that son of a bitch dead on.

411
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:11,085
It didn't stop, it didn't slow...

412
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:13,129
- Verheiden.
- It didn't even flinch!

413
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,631
- Verheiden!
- What?!

414
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:19,218
I am not a soldier, but I think
you should calm down now. Really.

415
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:21,554
We're not dead yet, OK?

416
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:24,390
Well, thanks, Professor!

417
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:30,396
Actually, it's Doctor.
And you're welcome. OK?

418
00:52:30,439 --> 00:52:32,357
What?!

419
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:38,529
(panicked panting)

420
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:50,583
Hey! Can you hear me?

421
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:57,298
It's Connors! Where are you?

422
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,219
Agh!

423
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,271
(screech)

424
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:16,943
(more screeching)

425
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:36,087
(Verheiden)
We're never getting out of this place.

426
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:39,048
Have you got any children?

427
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,260
- Got a son.
- Yeah? I've got two.

428
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:45,763
That means that we do not have
the luxury of quitting.

429
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:48,516
We're gonna make it outta here.

430
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:54,605
We're surviving this
if I have to carry you the whole way.

431
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:04,407
There's no way out back there.

432
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:09,203
No damage.

433
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,501
One of our men is dead.

434
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:27,388
I need to know what this man died for.

435
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:31,851
He died trying to make history.

436
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:37,190
Whose? Yours?

437
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,535
(beeping)

438
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,039
- What's that?
- Just a theory.

439
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:57,335
The Aztec calendar was metric.
Based on multiples of ten.

440
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:02,131
I'm guessing the pyramid
reconfigures every ten minutes.

441
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:04,634
(rumbling)

442
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:28,241
- Let's stick together.
- (coughing)

443
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:34,163
Weyland.

444
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:44,423
It would seem that we are rats in a maze.

445
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:49,470
Sorry.

446
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,760
Connors? Connors!

447
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:34,557
- (screeching)
- (yells)

448
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,025
Argh!

449
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,944
Verheiden? Verheiden?

450
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:50,323
- Oh, God.
- Dr Miller! Get me outta here!

451
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:54,201
It's OK. I'm gonna find a way
to get down to you. OK?

452
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:58,998
Verheiden!

453
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:01,000
No!

454
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:18,851
(hissing)

455
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:25,024
You want a piece of me?
You ugly son of a bitch!

456
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,196
(screams)

457
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,365
(muffled screaming)

458
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,454
Oh, God.

459
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:03,229
(clatter)

460
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,814
(Lex) Weyland.

461
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:08,192
- (distorted) You OK?
- (distorted) Yeah, I'm fine.

462
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:13,072
Leave it. They can only slow us down.

463
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:17,159
Too much has been lost
to leave here with nothing.

464
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:21,372
Give it to me.

465
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:41,976
- Max.
- Max.

466
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:46,522
(Lex) Hold on.

467
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,774
Look out!

468
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,835
(hisses)

469
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:07,144
(screeches)

470
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:28,207
Come on. We have to get Weyland.

471
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:38,133
Weyland, come on.

472
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:28,827
(screeches)

473
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,665
(coughing)

474
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:19,586
- (Sebastian) What were they?
- (Lex) You're the expert.

475
01:03:19,671 --> 01:03:22,548
(Weyland) I've got to stop. I've got to stop.

476
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:28,220
Take it easy. Weyland. Weyland.

477
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:30,013
Look at me. Look at me.

478
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:32,725
You have to slow your breathing down.

479
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:35,269
Slow, steady breaths.

480
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:43,193
- Weyland, come on.
- I can hardly stand.

481
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:45,571
I'm not gonna let you die down here.

482
01:03:45,697 --> 01:03:48,115
You didn't.

483
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:52,286
- There's another one. We have to go. Now!
- Weyland.

484
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:55,247
- (Sebastian) Come with us.
- Get her outta here.

485
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:57,916
- Now!
- Come on.

486
01:03:57,959 --> 01:04:00,586
(Weyland) Run!

487
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:31,116
Don't turn your back on me.

488
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:45,923
(Weyland screams)

489
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:48,091
- I'm going back.
- No, wait!

490
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:04,483
You can't help him.

491
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:09,696
We have to go. We keep it together,
we'll make it to the surface.

492
01:05:09,781 --> 01:05:13,283
Let's go.

493
01:05:17,956 --> 01:05:20,415
(distorted) We keep it together, we'll...

494
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,835
..keep it together,
we'll make it to the surface.

495
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:24,878
(clear) ..we'll make it to the surface.

496
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:27,839
(beeping)

497
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:29,258
Wait.

498
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:32,386
(rumbling)

499
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:39,268
This way.

500
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:48,151
Go! Go!

501
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:09,816
Look over here.

502
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:40,889
- He's marking himself.
- What?

503
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:45,519
Ancient warriors would mark themselves
with the blood of their kill.

504
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:46,937
It's a rite of passage.

505
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:55,278
This is starting to make sense.

506
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:06,832
I think this is a manhood ritual.

507
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:13,338
The humanoid ones, they've been sent here
to prove they're worthy to become adults.

508
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:20,011
You're saying they're, what... teenagers?

509
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:28,019
That's why they didn't carry
those guns to begin with.

510
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,188
They have to earn them.

511
01:08:42,034 --> 01:08:45,036
The hieroglyphs are
a little difficult to make out.

512
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:47,831
But the story is all here.

513
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:55,422
Thousands of years ago,
these hunters found a backwater planet.

514
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:01,094
(chanting)

515
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:07,893
They taught humans how to build
and were worshipped as gods.

516
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:16,359
Every hundred years the gods would return.

517
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:22,574
And when they did,
they would expect a sacrifice.

518
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:27,788
Humans were used to breed the ultimate prey.

519
01:09:36,464 --> 01:09:39,841
The hunters would battle
with these great serpents

520
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:43,887
to prove themselves worthy
to carry the mark.

521
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:02,989
But if the hunters lost,

522
01:10:03,074 --> 01:10:05,992
they made sure nothing survived.

523
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:14,459
An entire civilisation wiped out overnight.

524
01:10:17,255 --> 01:10:18,463
So...

525
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:25,011
the humanoids, the hunters -
they brought those creatures here to hunt?

526
01:10:25,137 --> 01:10:27,222
And they use us like cattle.

527
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:31,017
We're hosts for them to breed in.

528
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:34,646
The heat bloom was the sign
to lure us down here.

529
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:37,524
This whole thing was a trap.

530
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:41,236
Without us, there could be no hunt.

531
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:11,892
Shit!

532
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:13,977
Verheiden!

533
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:56,061
Oh, shit.

534
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:58,271
(gunfire)

535
01:11:58,356 --> 01:11:59,439
(screams)

536
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:04,235
When that door opens, we're dead.

537
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,364
- Not if we set things right.
- What do you mean?

538
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:10,617
This pyramid is like a prison.

539
01:12:11,619 --> 01:12:15,455
We took the guards' guns,
and now the prisoners are running free.

540
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:19,042
To restore order, the guards need their guns.

541
01:12:20,628 --> 01:12:25,590
When that door opens,
we're gonna give that thing his gun back.

542
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:30,512
Are you crazy? During a big-game hunt, the
animals being hunted don't arm the hunters.

543
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:34,099
They're not hunting us.
We're in the middle of a war.

544
01:12:34,266 --> 01:12:37,978
- It's time to pick a side.
- We are on our side.

545
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:44,818
We have to consider the possibility
that we might not make it out of here.

546
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:50,490
But we have to make sure
those serpents don't reach the surface.

547
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:53,493
Because if they do,

548
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:56,621
everything everywhere could die.

549
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:02,585
The enemy of my enemy...

550
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:05,839
is my friend.

551
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:11,011
(beeping)

552
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:31,364
Let's go find our friend.

553
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,960
How do you say "scared shitless" in Italian?

554
01:13:44,045 --> 01:13:49,049
Non vedo l'ora di uscire con te da questa
piramide perché mi sto cagando addosso.

555
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:51,551
More or less.

556
01:13:53,554 --> 01:14:02,353
(scraping)

557
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:15,075
Move!

558
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:38,515
(screams)

559
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:43,812
Lex.

560
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:45,438
Hold on.

561
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:47,732
Come on, Lex.

562
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:53,822
(screams)

563
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:55,281
Oh, no.

564
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:26,354
(object falls)

565
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,376
(rumbling)

566
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:53,066
Wait. Wait. Please, wait.

567
01:16:57,071 --> 01:17:00,281
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

568
01:17:02,743 --> 01:17:05,161
(distorted) The enemy of my enemy
is my friend.

569
01:18:13,147 --> 01:18:14,480
(screeching)

570
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:05,782
Hey.

571
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:10,370
I'm coming with you.
You hear me, you ugly creature?

572
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:05,591
What are you doing?

573
01:22:30,445 --> 01:22:42,999
Miller!

574
01:22:54,886 --> 01:22:56,262
(gasps)

575
01:23:20,078 --> 01:23:21,871
(gasping)

576
01:23:33,216 --> 01:23:34,550
Sebastian.

577
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:38,262
- Help me, Lex.
- I'm gonna get you out of there.

578
01:23:38,388 --> 01:23:42,058
- It's too late. It's inside me.
- I'm gonna get you outta here.

579
01:23:42,142 --> 01:23:44,435
- You can't...
- No!

580
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:47,480
No. No. No! No!

581
01:23:47,564 --> 01:23:49,648
I have to help him.

582
01:23:52,903 --> 01:23:54,653
Lex!

583
01:23:54,738 --> 01:24:00,493
They mustn't reach the surface.

584
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:03,329
- I know.
- (groans)

585
01:24:11,213 --> 01:24:13,255
Do it!

586
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:19,095
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

587
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:44,787
(growls)

588
01:25:38,842 --> 01:25:41,260
It's a bomb.

589
01:25:41,344 --> 01:25:43,512
Well, I hope it kills every fucking one of 'em.

590
01:25:43,638 --> 01:25:45,389
(beeping)

591
01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:32,269
You are one ugly mother...

592
01:28:41,524 --> 01:28:44,026
(roars)

593
01:30:05,859 --> 01:30:06,942
(Lex gasps)
