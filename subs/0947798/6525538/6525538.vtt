1
00:03:55.348 --> 00:03:57.407
I had the craziest dream last night.

2
00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.453
I was dancing the white swan.

3
00:04:03.056 --> 00:04:06.456
It was different choreography though.
It was more like the Bolshoi's.

4
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.880
It was the prologue...

5
00:04:12.765 --> 00:04:14.756
when Rothbart casts his spell.

6
00:04:24.443 --> 00:04:27.143
Look how pink. So pretty.

7
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.475
Pretty.

8
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.050
You're in a good mood.

9
00:04:32.119 --> 00:04:34.419
He promised to feature me
more this season.

10
00:04:34.988 --> 00:04:36.695
Well, he certainly should.

11
00:04:36.997 --> 00:04:38.281
You've been there long enough...

12
00:04:39.057 --> 00:04:41.657
and you're the most dedicated
dancer in the company.

13
00:04:45.631 --> 00:04:46.631
Up.

14
00:04:48.501 --> 00:04:49.701
What's that?
What?

15
00:04:50.036 --> 00:04:51.036
There.

16
00:04:54.173 --> 00:04:55.173
Nothing.

17
00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:01.379
Sure you don't want me
to come with you?

18
00:05:03.983 --> 00:05:05.483
You sweet girl.

19
00:06:19.359 --> 00:06:22.522
Did you see Beth today?
I can't believe she's back.

20
00:06:23.095 --> 00:06:24.595
Of course she's back.

21
00:06:24.664 --> 00:06:26.375
What? She can't take a hint?

22
00:06:26.377 --> 00:06:27.506
The company's broke.

23
00:06:27.508 --> 00:06:29.333
No one comes to see her anymore.

24
00:06:29.402 --> 00:06:31.893
Nobody actually comes
to see ballet, full stop.

25
00:06:32.171 --> 00:06:33.236
That's not true.

26
00:06:33.238 --> 00:06:35.338
I heard the Royal had one
of their best seasons yet.

27
00:06:35.375 --> 00:06:37.775
He just needs to try something new.
That's all.

28
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.969
No. Someone new.

29
00:06:41.246 --> 00:06:42.246
Like who?

30
00:06:42.415 --> 00:06:44.615
Like someone who's
not approaching menopause.

31
00:06:44.817 --> 00:06:45.917
It's sad.

32
00:06:46.386 --> 00:06:47.586
What's sad?

33
00:06:51.524 --> 00:06:53.389
Beth's such a beautiful dancer.

34
00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:55.259
Yeah. So is my grandmother.

35
00:06:55.461 --> 00:06:58.555
Well, Fonteyn danced into her 50s.

36
00:06:58.631 --> 00:07:00.031
Yeah. We know.

37
00:07:01.367 --> 00:07:02.076
Hey.

38
00:07:02.378 --> 00:07:03.478
Oh. Soloists?

39
00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:07.331
Great.

40
00:07:07.733 --> 00:07:09.733
I fucking missed my stop.

41
00:07:10.575 --> 00:07:12.175
Had to hoof it all the way from 79th.

42
00:07:12.178 --> 00:07:14.612
Who's that?
It's that girl from San Francisco.

43
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.174
And up...

44
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:54.242
two, three, four.

45
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.620
Good. One.

46
00:07:59.292 --> 00:08:01.624
Two, three, four.

47
00:08:01.694 --> 00:08:02.694
Up.

48
00:08:03.662 --> 00:08:05.662
Beautiful as always, Nina.

49
00:08:06.565 --> 00:08:07.565
Relax.

50
00:08:12.238 --> 00:08:13.728
And one, and two.

51
00:08:13.806 --> 00:08:16.001
And three, and four, and...

52
00:08:22.381 --> 00:08:24.081
Stop, John. One second.

53
00:08:34.427 --> 00:08:36.418
Ok. Take position.

54
00:08:36.996 --> 00:08:38.657
And one, and two.

55
00:08:38.731 --> 00:08:40.596
And three, and up.

56
00:08:40.766 --> 00:08:42.345
One, and two.

57
00:08:42.347 --> 00:08:44.247
And three, and four.

58
00:08:56.616 --> 00:08:57.476
How are you?

59
00:08:57.478 --> 00:08:58.608
Good. Thank you.

60
00:09:05.257 --> 00:09:06.986
We all know the story.

61
00:09:07.894 --> 00:09:09.828
Virginal girl, pure and sweet...

62
00:09:10.396 --> 00:09:12.296
trapped in the body of a swan.

63
00:09:13.866 --> 00:09:15.466
She desires freedom,

64
00:09:17.003 --> 00:09:19.403
but only true love can break the spell.

65
00:09:21.707 --> 00:09:24.141
Her wish is nearly granted,

66
00:09:25.745 --> 00:09:27.145
in the form of a prince.

67
00:09:28.915 --> 00:09:31.509
But before he can declare his love,

68
00:09:31.784 --> 00:09:33.240
her lustful twin,

69
00:09:33.242 --> 00:09:34.542
the black swan,

70
00:09:35.822 --> 00:09:37.822
tricks and seduces him.

71
00:09:42.161 --> 00:09:43.461
Devastated,

72
00:09:43.763 --> 00:09:47.763
the white swan leaps off a cliff,

73
00:09:47.867 --> 00:09:49.567
killing herself,

74
00:09:50.503 --> 00:09:51.903
and in death,

75
00:09:53.706 --> 00:09:55.006
finds freedom.

76
00:10:01.514 --> 00:10:02.804
Good morning, company.

77
00:10:02.806 --> 00:10:03.942
Good morning.

78
00:10:05.852 --> 00:10:08.252
We open our season with Swan Lake.

79
00:10:08.754 --> 00:10:10.154
Done to death, I know...

80
00:10:10.857 --> 00:10:12.257
but not like this.

81
00:10:12.859 --> 00:10:14.159
We strip it down,

82
00:10:14.483 --> 00:10:15.983
make it visceral,

83
00:10:16.061 --> 00:10:17.389
and real.

84
00:10:18.898 --> 00:10:22.163
A new production needs
a new Swan Queen.

85
00:10:23.436 --> 00:10:25.736
A fresh face to present to the world.

86
00:10:27.874 --> 00:10:28.874
But...

87
00:10:30.142 --> 00:10:32.802
which of you can embody both swans?

88
00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:36.479
The white and the black?

89
00:10:42.889 --> 00:10:45.289
All the soloists I tapped...

90
00:10:45.892 --> 00:10:48.087
go to your scheduled
rehearsals this afternoon.

91
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.830
And the girls I didn't tap...

92
00:10:55.301 --> 00:10:57.401
meet me in the principals'
studio at 5:00.

93
00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:58.970
Thank you.

94
00:11:03.175 --> 00:11:04.048
Alright.

95
00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.044
Let's go. Did we do left side?

96
00:11:06.045 --> 00:11:08.645
Yes, mistress.
Let's hit it one more time.

97
00:11:43.182 --> 00:11:44.706
Fuck! Fuck!

98
00:11:50.656 --> 00:11:51.714
What?

99
00:13:32.324 --> 00:13:35.259
If I was only casting the white swan,
she'd be yours.

100
00:13:37.396 --> 00:13:38.396
But I'm not.

101
00:13:38.698 --> 00:13:39.798
Maestro.

102
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.133
Odile's coda, please.

103
00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.000
Now show me your black swan, Nina.

104
00:14:06.759 --> 00:14:08.159
Not so controlled.

105
00:14:08.263 --> 00:14:09.285
Seduce us.

106
00:14:09.661 --> 00:14:11.224
Not just the prince, but the court,

107
00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:13.015
the audience, the entire world.

108
00:14:13.017 --> 00:14:13.495
Come on!

109
00:14:13.865 --> 00:14:16.136
Your fouetteés are like
a spider spinning a web.

110
00:14:16.138 --> 00:14:17.803
Attack it!
Attack it!

111
00:14:18.105 --> 00:14:19.105
Come on!

112
00:14:29.448 --> 00:14:30.536
Well...

113
00:14:30.838 --> 00:14:32.138
good of you to join us.

114
00:14:32.184 --> 00:14:33.251
Sorry.

115
00:14:33.253 --> 00:14:34.753
Girls, this is Lily.

116
00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.885
Straight off the plane
from San Francisco.

117
00:14:36.956 --> 00:14:38.664
She's filling Rebecca's old spot.

118
00:14:38.666 --> 00:14:39.289
Hey.

119
00:14:39.558 --> 00:14:41.064
Get warmed up.
No, it's ok.

120
00:14:41.566 --> 00:14:42.566
I'm good.

121
00:14:44.497 --> 00:14:45.797
Should I go again?

122
00:14:46.832 --> 00:14:48.332
No. Thanks, Nina.
I've seen enough.

123
00:14:51.537 --> 00:14:54.137
Ok. Veronica.
The white swan variation.

124
00:14:57.843 --> 00:14:59.243
Come on, come on,
come on, please.

125
00:15:00.212 --> 00:15:01.612
Alright. Maestro.

126
00:15:02.615 --> 00:15:04.415
Two, three.

127
00:16:10.716 --> 00:16:12.116
So how'd it go?

128
00:16:13.686 --> 00:16:16.086
You were late,
so I called Susie in the office.

129
00:16:16.422 --> 00:16:19.122
An audition. I can't believe
he just sprang that on you.

130
00:16:20.025 --> 00:16:21.025
So?

131
00:16:21.894 --> 00:16:23.194
It was fine.

132
00:16:23.896 --> 00:16:25.196
Just fine?

133
00:16:27.632 --> 00:16:28.932
Sweetheart.

134
00:16:30.636 --> 00:16:32.836
Oh, you tell me about it.

135
00:16:38.043 --> 00:16:40.511
I know Susie, but he just can't
expect these girls,

136
00:16:40.579 --> 00:16:43.104
to come back from a break
and dance like Beth Maclntyre.

137
00:16:43.482 --> 00:16:44.982
It's completely unrealistic.

138
00:16:46.218 --> 00:16:49.346
I mean, they can do the work,
but they don't have Beth's magic.

139
00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.160
She's miserable, and it's...

140
00:17:26.658 --> 00:17:28.158
Nina? Everything alright?

141
00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.460
I'm fine!

142
00:17:43.609 --> 00:17:44.809
Almost done.

143
00:17:45.277 --> 00:17:47.077
You're working yourself too hard.

144
00:17:48.847 --> 00:17:50.337
We all have off days.

145
00:17:50.716 --> 00:17:52.516
If that girl hadn't barged in...

146
00:17:52.851 --> 00:17:54.451
I'm sure she didn't mean to.

147
00:17:56.055 --> 00:17:57.989
Remember when you first started?

148
00:17:58.357 --> 00:18:02.357
If I hadn't taken you to each of your classes,
you would have been completely lost.

149
00:18:02.361 --> 00:18:05.023
I'm gonna talk to him tomorrow.
I'm gonna tell him I finished it.

150
00:18:05.197 --> 00:18:06.562
You don't need to lie.

151
00:18:07.264 --> 00:18:09.264
It won't convince him
one way or the other.

152
00:18:12.771 --> 00:18:14.071
Oh, sweetheart.

153
00:18:16.475 --> 00:18:18.075
I know it's disappointing.

154
00:18:19.178 --> 00:18:21.678
And when you start getting older,
there is all this...

155
00:18:22.214 --> 00:18:23.772
ridiculous pressure.

156
00:18:23.849 --> 00:18:25.449
God knows, I understand.

157
00:18:26.885 --> 00:18:28.385
But it's alright.

158
00:18:29.822 --> 00:18:31.122
No matter what.

159
00:18:33.025 --> 00:18:34.176
You'll probably,

160
00:18:34.178 --> 00:18:36.078
get to dance the pas de quatre again.

161
00:18:37.495 --> 00:18:38.895
That's such a wonderful part.

162
00:18:40.332 --> 00:18:42.332
Or maybe he'll make you a big swan.

163
00:18:43.369 --> 00:18:44.451
Either way,

164
00:18:45.453 --> 00:18:46.453
you'll shine.

165
00:18:47.806 --> 00:18:48.795
I know.

166
00:18:49.908 --> 00:18:51.842
Everything will be better
in the morning.

167
00:18:54.046 --> 00:18:55.546
It always is.

168
00:18:59.084 --> 00:19:00.184
Sweet girl.

169
00:19:21.707 --> 00:19:22.707
Ciao.

170
00:19:26.512 --> 00:19:27.535
Yes, Nina?

171
00:19:27.537 --> 00:19:28.640
Do you have a minute?

172
00:19:32.117 --> 00:19:34.817
If now's not a good time, I can...
Now is perfect.

173
00:19:37.089 --> 00:19:38.089
So?

174
00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.060
I just wanted to tell you that...

175
00:19:43.962 --> 00:19:46.283
I practiced the coda last night and...

176
00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:48.129
I finished.

177
00:19:52.971 --> 00:19:54.871
I thought you should know.

178
00:19:54.973 --> 00:19:56.347
Ok, Nina, listen.

179
00:19:56.449 --> 00:19:58.635
Honestly, I don't care about
your technique.

180
00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:00.778
You should know that by now.

181
00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:01.780
Yeah, but yester...
No.

182
00:20:01.846 --> 00:20:04.346
Anyway, I've already chosen Veronica.

183
00:20:04.349 --> 00:20:05.349
So...

184
00:20:07.019 --> 00:20:08.019
Sorry.

185
00:20:08.921 --> 00:20:10.321
Ok. Thank you.

186
00:20:13.158 --> 00:20:14.301
That's it?

187
00:20:14.803 --> 00:20:16.703
You're not gonna try
and change my mind?

188
00:20:18.029 --> 00:20:19.829
You must have thought it was possible.

189
00:20:20.131 --> 00:20:22.206
Otherwise, what are you doing here all...

190
00:20:22.608 --> 00:20:23.608
dolled up?

191
00:20:25.204 --> 00:20:27.404
I came to ask for the part.

192
00:20:32.211 --> 00:20:33.211
Well...

193
00:20:33.679 --> 00:20:34.879
the truth is...

194
00:20:36.248 --> 00:20:37.448
when I look at you...

195
00:20:38.484 --> 00:20:39.984
all I see is the white swan.

196
00:20:40.586 --> 00:20:42.143
Yes you're beautiful,

197
00:20:42.145 --> 00:20:43.945
fearful, fragile.

198
00:20:44.423 --> 00:20:45.651
Ideal casting.

199
00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:48.976
But the black swan?

200
00:20:49.478 --> 00:20:51.278
It's a hard fucking job to dance both.

201
00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:53.527
I can dance the black swan too.

202
00:20:54.099 --> 00:20:55.099
Really?

203
00:20:56.101 --> 00:20:58.101
In four years, every time you dance...

204
00:20:58.337 --> 00:21:00.817
I see you obsess getting each
and every move perfectly right,

205
00:21:00.873 --> 00:21:03.073
but I never see you lose yourself.

206
00:21:03.575 --> 00:21:04.575
Ever.

207
00:21:05.644 --> 00:21:07.144
All that discipline for what?

208
00:21:10.883 --> 00:21:13.083
I just want to be perfect.
You what?

209
00:21:13.519 --> 00:21:15.219
I want to be perfect.

210
00:21:18.157 --> 00:21:20.757
Perfection is not just about control.

211
00:21:21.827 --> 00:21:24.027
It's also about letting go.

212
00:21:24.896 --> 00:21:27.496
Surprise yourself,
so you can surprise the audience.

213
00:21:27.633 --> 00:21:28.833
Transcendence.

214
00:21:29.568 --> 00:21:31.268
And very few have it in them.

215
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:33.861
I think I do have it in...

216
00:21:41.812 --> 00:21:42.812
You bit me?

217
00:21:43.415 --> 00:21:45.815
I can... I can't believe you,
you bit me.

218
00:21:46.318 --> 00:21:47.418
I'm sorry.

219
00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.720
Now, that fucking hurt.

220
00:21:52.925 --> 00:21:54.425
You were great.
Thanks.

221
00:21:56.061 --> 00:21:57.961
Yeah. Really. No.

222
00:22:01.466 --> 00:22:02.466
Yeah.

223
00:22:05.837 --> 00:22:08.837
What?
Why is she always staring at me?

224
00:22:09.208 --> 00:22:11.308
She's obsessed with you.

225
00:22:11.777 --> 00:22:13.477
Hey. It's been posted.

226
00:22:14.479 --> 00:22:15.679
Hey. It's up.

227
00:22:21.153 --> 00:22:22.153
Veronica.

228
00:22:24.723 --> 00:22:26.281
Congratulations.

229
00:22:41.106 --> 00:22:42.106
Hey!

230
00:22:43.442 --> 00:22:44.942
Why would you say that?

231
00:22:46.444 --> 00:22:47.944
Your idea of some sick joke?

232
00:22:48.614 --> 00:22:49.514
What?

233
00:22:50.782 --> 00:22:51.882
Fuck you.

234
00:23:00.492 --> 00:23:02.592
Oh, my goodness!

235
00:23:05.797 --> 00:23:06.756
Hey, Nina.

236
00:23:06.758 --> 00:23:08.158
Congratulations.

237
00:23:10.135 --> 00:23:11.535
Congratulations.

238
00:23:13.739 --> 00:23:15.968
Oh, Nina. Congratulations.

239
00:23:15.969 --> 00:23:17.969
You were so beautiful
at the audition.

240
00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:19.168
I knew you were gonna get it.

241
00:23:19.244 --> 00:23:20.609
Congratulations.

242
00:23:20.679 --> 00:23:22.738
Congratulations.
Congratulations.

243
00:23:37.896 --> 00:23:38.896
<i>Hello?</i>
Hi.

244
00:23:39.531 --> 00:23:41.795
<i>What is it? What's wrong?</i>
I'm fine.

245
00:23:43.167 --> 00:23:44.167
<i>What is it?</i>

246
00:23:44.436 --> 00:23:46.036
He picked me, Mommy.

247
00:23:49.174 --> 00:23:51.369
Did you hear me?
<i>For Swan Lake?</i>

248
00:23:51.443 --> 00:23:53.337
I'm gonna be the new Swan Queen.

249
00:23:53.339 --> 00:23:54.504
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

250
00:23:54.579 --> 00:23:56.638
Well,

251
00:23:57.015 --> 00:23:59.038
I'll be home soon.
I just wanted to let you know.

252
00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.040
<i>I love you.</i>

253
00:24:00.068 --> 00:24:01.481
I love you too.

254
00:24:01.483 --> 00:24:02.469
<i>Oh! Please...</i>

255
00:24:36.321 --> 00:24:37.321
Mom?

256
00:24:40.592 --> 00:24:41.992
Mom, are you in your room?

257
00:25:15.627 --> 00:25:16.907
Nina.

258
00:25:16.909 --> 00:25:17.892
Are you home?

259
00:25:30.342 --> 00:25:32.642
Nina, when you get out,
I'm in the kitchen.

260
00:25:34.679 --> 00:25:35.979
Come on, sweetie.

261
00:25:39.885 --> 00:25:42.485
My daughter, the Swan Queen.

262
00:25:47.159 --> 00:25:48.476
It's our favorite.

263
00:25:48.478 --> 00:25:50.254
Vanilla with strawberry filling.

264
00:25:50.328 --> 00:25:52.128
Oh, Mom, not too big.

265
00:25:52.497 --> 00:25:54.158
Oh, that's way, way too much.

266
00:25:54.232 --> 00:25:55.995
It's a celebration.
It's just this once.

267
00:25:56.067 --> 00:25:56.616
Mom...

268
00:25:56.918 --> 00:25:58.818
My stomach's still in knots.

269
00:26:00.705 --> 00:26:01.905
Fine.

270
00:26:03.175 --> 00:26:05.175
Fine. Then it's garbage.

271
00:26:05.377 --> 00:26:07.577
No. Mom, don't. I'm sorry.

272
00:26:14.219 --> 00:26:15.519
I'm just...

273
00:26:17.422 --> 00:26:18.822
I'm just so proud of you.

274
00:26:20.025 --> 00:26:21.825
That looks so yummy.

275
00:26:34.605 --> 00:26:35.605
Smoother.

276
00:27:34.065 --> 00:27:36.693
Ok, ok. Thank you. Thank you.

277
00:27:37.469 --> 00:27:38.769
Thank you, Nina.

278
00:27:39.437 --> 00:27:40.534
It's very nice.

279
00:27:41.536 --> 00:27:42.536
It's very nice.

280
00:27:43.942 --> 00:27:46.242
But I knew the white swan
wouldn't be a problem.

281
00:27:47.445 --> 00:27:48.693
The real work,

282
00:27:48.995 --> 00:27:51.395
will be your metamorphosis
into her evil twin.

283
00:27:52.817 --> 00:27:55.017
And I know I saw
a flash of her yesterday.

284
00:27:56.354 --> 00:27:58.454
So, get ready to give me
more of that bite.

285
00:28:06.197 --> 00:28:07.397
Up...

286
00:28:07.899 --> 00:28:08.959
and...

287
00:28:16.641 --> 00:28:17.641
Alright.

288
00:28:20.178 --> 00:28:21.578
Excellent.

289
00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:24.380
That evil force is pulling you,

290
00:28:24.391 --> 00:28:26.749
that you can't escape,
that's just like...

291
00:28:26.851 --> 00:28:28.051
out of your control.

292
00:28:28.453 --> 00:28:30.398
So you're... you're...
just you sense it,

293
00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.400
you get aware of it more,
It's taking me. It's taking me.

294
00:28:34.092 --> 00:28:35.792
A little bit more desperate.

295
00:28:36.528 --> 00:28:38.101
Right. And you can...

296
00:28:38.103 --> 00:28:40.843
maybe go up a little bit and then
come down and then...

297
00:28:40.899 --> 00:28:42.093
That's it.

298
00:28:50.208 --> 00:28:51.508
Three, four.

299
00:28:54.679 --> 00:28:56.003
Oh, that's beautiful.

300
00:28:56.005 --> 00:28:58.305
Step and a step. And...

301
00:29:16.834 --> 00:29:18.597
Watch the way she moves.

302
00:29:20.071 --> 00:29:21.771
Imprecise, but...

303
00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:23.940
effortless.

304
00:29:26.144 --> 00:29:27.444
She's not faking it.

305
00:29:29.948 --> 00:29:31.148
Gorgeous.

306
00:29:34.586 --> 00:29:36.520
Ok. That's beautiful.
Sorry.

307
00:29:36.588 --> 00:29:38.288
We'll start again from the beginning.

308
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:40.190
Ok.

309
00:29:40.859 --> 00:29:41.859
Sorry.

310
00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:46.930
Welcome to the principals' room.

311
00:29:47.232 --> 00:29:50.132
You room with Beth from now on,
so be considerate.

312
00:29:50.669 --> 00:29:51.869
Thanks, Susie.

313
00:29:52.337 --> 00:29:54.137
Those are for you, from Mr. Leroy.

314
00:29:54.806 --> 00:29:56.306
They're beautiful.

315
00:30:13.692 --> 00:30:15.292
Come on.
I'll be back in a second.

316
00:30:18.396 --> 00:30:19.996
Let me come back to you, please.

317
00:30:21.466 --> 00:30:22.266
Ok.

318
00:30:23.268 --> 00:30:24.268
Let's go.

319
00:30:29.741 --> 00:30:31.641
Ready to be thrown to the wolves?

320
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:34.810
We need their cash,
so, please, don't forget to smile.

321
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.500
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
may I have your attention?

322
00:30:41.151 --> 00:30:42.151
Good evening.

323
00:30:42.353 --> 00:30:44.953
Let me make this
very important announcement.

324
00:30:45.824 --> 00:30:48.224
You all have had the chance
and the privilege...

325
00:30:48.693 --> 00:30:51.093
to be enchanted, transported...

326
00:30:51.262 --> 00:30:56.062
and even sometimes devastated by the
performances of this true artist of our company.

327
00:30:56.501 --> 00:30:59.001
She's been a crucial inspiration
to my work...

328
00:30:59.104 --> 00:31:02.704
a role model to all dancers,
and even more than that...

329
00:31:02.774 --> 00:31:05.766
a deeply appreciated
presence on our stage.

330
00:31:05.944 --> 00:31:07.944
You all know who I'm talking about.

331
00:31:08.413 --> 00:31:09.763
Ladies and gentlemen,

332
00:31:10.265 --> 00:31:11.465
Beth Maclntyre.

333
00:31:16.387 --> 00:31:17.724
But as we all know,

334
00:31:17.726 --> 00:31:20.426
every great career has
to come to an end.

335
00:31:20.992 --> 00:31:23.317
Beth is retiring...

336
00:31:23.819 --> 00:31:25.019
at the end of the season.

337
00:31:26.331 --> 00:31:28.891
She will be giving her farewell
performance as Melpomene...

338
00:31:29.667 --> 00:31:31.867
the role she originated
in my first ballet.

339
00:31:34.339 --> 00:31:35.639
My little princess.

340
00:31:36.541 --> 00:31:37.861
We honor you.

341
00:31:37.863 --> 00:31:39.594
You will be greatly missed...

342
00:31:39.596 --> 00:31:40.946
and never forgotten.

343
00:31:42.847 --> 00:31:46.547
But, as we bid adieu to one star,
we welcome another.

344
00:31:47.218 --> 00:31:50.415
We are opening our season
with my new version of Swan Lake.

345
00:31:50.888 --> 00:31:52.788
Taking the role of our new Swan Queen,

346
00:31:52.924 --> 00:31:55.624
the exquisite, Nina Sayers.

347
00:32:00.932 --> 00:32:03.469
You'll soon have the pleasure
of seeing her but...

348
00:32:04.071 --> 00:32:06.605
right now please let's raise a glass...

349
00:32:07.207 --> 00:32:08.307
to all of us...

350
00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:09.911
to Beth,

351
00:32:10.613 --> 00:32:11.613
to Nina...

352
00:32:13.344 --> 00:32:14.544
to beauty.

353
00:32:32.196 --> 00:32:33.396
Just a second.

354
00:32:42.606 --> 00:32:43.606
Just a second.

355
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.650
Come on. I'm about to burst.

356
00:33:13.304 --> 00:33:15.204
Hey. It's you.

357
00:33:15.907 --> 00:33:17.744
I don't think we ever officially met.

358
00:33:17.746 --> 00:33:18.599
I'm Lily.

359
00:33:18.876 --> 00:33:20.376
Hi. Nina.

360
00:33:20.545 --> 00:33:22.745
Yes. Our new Swan Queen.

361
00:33:22.947 --> 00:33:24.881
<i>Here. Hold this?
Yeah. Sure.</i>

362
00:33:24.949 --> 00:33:28.908
Oh, you must be so excited.

363
00:33:30.487 --> 00:33:32.087
Are you freaking out?

364
00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:34.090
Yeah.
Yeah?

365
00:33:35.892 --> 00:33:36.892
It's ok.

366
00:33:37.294 --> 00:33:38.494
I'd be losing my mind.

367
00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:40.630
Well, I should get back.

368
00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:42.450
No. No, no. Come on. Stay.

369
00:33:43.152 --> 00:33:44.252
Keep me company.

370
00:33:47.872 --> 00:33:48.972
Excuse me.

371
00:33:51.042 --> 00:33:52.242
There you are. Come on.

372
00:33:57.749 --> 00:33:58.749
Hey.

373
00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:00.269
They tried to eat you alive,

374
00:34:00.271 --> 00:34:01.149
but here you are.

375
00:34:01.953 --> 00:34:03.247
You did well.

376
00:34:03.649 --> 00:34:04.388
Really?

377
00:34:05.657 --> 00:34:06.787
Where are you going?

378
00:34:07.889 --> 00:34:08.989
Upper West Side.

379
00:34:09.393 --> 00:34:11.293
Stop at my place for a drink.
It's on the way.

380
00:34:11.596 --> 00:34:15.054
Thomas. You need to say
hello to Karen Halloway.

381
00:34:17.001 --> 00:34:18.501
A minute more of ass kissing,
I'll be back.

382
00:34:18.502 --> 00:34:19.602
Wait for me here. Alright?

383
00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:23.470
Hello, Karen!

384
00:35:06.516 --> 00:35:07.316
Beth.

385
00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:11.348
I'm so sorry to hear
you're leaving the company.

386
00:35:13.491 --> 00:35:15.425
What'd you do to get this role?

387
00:35:18.328 --> 00:35:21.328
He always said you were
such a frigid little girl.

388
00:35:22.333 --> 00:35:24.733
What did you do
to make him change his mind?

389
00:35:26.637 --> 00:35:28.254
Did you suck his cock?

390
00:35:28.656 --> 00:35:30.556
Not all of us have to.

391
00:35:33.177 --> 00:35:34.977
You fucking whore.

392
00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:38.210
You're a fucking little whore.

393
00:35:38.782 --> 00:35:39.782
What's going on here?

394
00:35:39.951 --> 00:35:41.351
Hey. Hey.

395
00:35:41.619 --> 00:35:43.073
I need to talk to you.

396
00:35:43.475 --> 00:35:44.887
I think you're drunk.
I need to talk to you.

397
00:35:44.888 --> 00:35:45.988
You should go home.
No!

398
00:35:45.989 --> 00:35:48.425
Don't you do that.
Don't you dismiss me like that.

399
00:35:48.426 --> 00:35:49.426
Beth.

400
00:35:50.962 --> 00:35:52.606
My little princess please,

401
00:35:52.608 --> 00:35:53.830
hold it together.

402
00:35:55.366 --> 00:35:57.252
I'm coming by later.

403
00:35:57.254 --> 00:35:57.767
Come on.

404
00:35:57.835 --> 00:36:01.669
I have something for you.
It's a token of my appreciation.

405
00:36:01.739 --> 00:36:02.335
Right.

406
00:36:02.337 --> 00:36:04.437
You make the most of it, Nina.

407
00:36:05.777 --> 00:36:07.277
Don't worry. It's typical.

408
00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:13.550
Please.

409
00:36:14.185 --> 00:36:16.160
I thought it would be good
to talk about the role.

410
00:36:16.162 --> 00:36:17.362
Ground us a little.
Yeah.

411
00:36:17.722 --> 00:36:19.747
I don't want there to be
any boundaries between us.

412
00:36:20.024 --> 00:36:21.103
No. Me neither.

413
00:36:21.105 --> 00:36:21.686
Good.

414
00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:23.660
So...

415
00:36:25.129 --> 00:36:26.429
you got a boyfriend?

416
00:36:27.732 --> 00:36:28.732
No.

417
00:36:30.168 --> 00:36:32.068
And you had many in the past?

418
00:36:33.471 --> 00:36:36.031
A few, but no one serious.

419
00:36:40.678 --> 00:36:42.178
You're not a virgin, are you?

420
00:36:44.782 --> 00:36:45.908
No.

421
00:36:46.083 --> 00:36:48.483
Well. So there is nothing
to be embarrassed about.

422
00:36:53.357 --> 00:36:55.482
And you enjoy making love?

423
00:36:57.095 --> 00:36:58.221
Excuse me?

424
00:36:58.396 --> 00:37:00.023
Oh, come on. Sex.

425
00:37:00.297 --> 00:37:01.897
Do you enjoy it?

426
00:37:04.235 --> 00:37:06.435
Well, we need to be able
to talk about this.

427
00:37:14.312 --> 00:37:16.412
I got a little homework
assignment for you.

428
00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:20.649
Go home and touch yourself.

429
00:37:22.253 --> 00:37:23.413
Live a little.

430
00:37:27.692 --> 00:37:28.929
Well, it's late.

431
00:37:29.331 --> 00:37:30.731
Lots of work tomorrow.

432
00:37:31.395 --> 00:37:33.329
The doorman will find
a cab for you.

433
00:37:37.368 --> 00:37:39.368
Sounds like quite an evening.

434
00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:41.230
I wish I could have been there.

435
00:37:41.239 --> 00:37:42.266
You know I asked.

436
00:37:42.268 --> 00:37:44.668
I know you did. Susie told me.

437
00:37:45.042 --> 00:37:46.982
Guess he wanted you all to himself.

438
00:37:46.984 --> 00:37:47.603
That's not why.

439
00:37:48.078 --> 00:37:49.778
I don't blame him.

440
00:37:53.017 --> 00:37:54.314
Where'd you get these?

441
00:37:54.316 --> 00:37:56.016
They're fake.

442
00:37:58.088 --> 00:37:59.088
Fooled me.

443
00:38:06.697 --> 00:38:08.097
I can do it.

444
00:38:11.402 --> 00:38:14.502
He must have been
by your side all night.

445
00:38:16.607 --> 00:38:17.807
Showing you off.

446
00:38:20.278 --> 00:38:21.529
Oh, Nina.

447
00:38:21.531 --> 00:38:22.679
It's just a rash.

448
00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.380
Just a rash?
What are you talking about?

449
00:38:24.382 --> 00:38:26.282
It was worse a few days ago.
It's fine already.

450
00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:27.529
You've been scratching yourself again.

451
00:38:27.531 --> 00:38:29.320
No, I haven't. Mom.

452
00:38:29.487 --> 00:38:32.187
I thought you'd outgrown
this disgusting habit.

453
00:38:33.057 --> 00:38:34.161
Jesus Christ.

454
00:38:34.163 --> 00:38:35.492
I thought you were done with this, Nina.

455
00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:36.252
Shrugs.

456
00:38:36.554 --> 00:38:37.729
You'll keep wearing the shrugs.

457
00:38:37.731 --> 00:38:38.548
Sit down.
I have been.

458
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:40.950
You have the white one
and the pink one,

459
00:38:41.098 --> 00:38:42.198
and that'll hide it.

460
00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.500
And then...
And then I'll dig out, that...

461
00:38:44.747 --> 00:38:46.647
that expensive cover-up.
We still have some.

462
00:38:47.438 --> 00:38:48.638
No one will see it.

463
00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.500
Mom, please.

464
00:38:50.908 --> 00:38:52.118
It's the role, isn't it?

465
00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:54.120
It's all this pressure. I...

466
00:38:54.644 --> 00:38:56.644
II knew it'd be too much.
I knew it.

467
00:39:00.384 --> 00:39:01.513
Are you alright?

468
00:39:02.615 --> 00:39:03.615
You alright?

469
00:39:03.754 --> 00:39:04.754
It'll be alright.

470
00:40:48.392 --> 00:40:49.992
Good Veronica.

471
00:40:55.793 --> 00:40:56.893
In same time.

472
00:40:56.894 --> 00:40:58.694
Extend. Attention.

473
00:40:58.695 --> 00:40:59.895
Wrist back.

474
00:40:59.896 --> 00:41:00.896
Good.

475
00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:07.910
What happened?

476
00:41:08.279 --> 00:41:09.879
Beth is in the hospital.

477
00:41:10.581 --> 00:41:12.481
She had an accident.
Oh, no.

478
00:41:12.882 --> 00:41:14.082
Oh no!

479
00:41:14.251 --> 00:41:15.651
Beth?
She's really hurt.

480
00:41:15.852 --> 00:41:16.952
What happened to Beth?

481
00:41:16.953 --> 00:41:18.253
Ok. What happen?

482
00:41:22.226 --> 00:41:23.716
What happened?

483
00:41:25.696 --> 00:41:28.028
She walked into the street
and got hit by a car.

484
00:41:30.167 --> 00:41:31.367
And you know what?

485
00:41:33.137 --> 00:41:34.937
I'm almost sure she did it on purpose.

486
00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:37.640
How do you know?

487
00:41:38.109 --> 00:41:40.134
Because everything Beth does
comes from within,

488
00:41:40.511 --> 00:41:42.311
from some dark impulse.

489
00:41:44.081 --> 00:41:46.281
I guess that's what makes her
so thrilling to watch.

490
00:41:47.017 --> 00:41:48.317
So dangerous.

491
00:41:49.987 --> 00:41:51.716
Even perfect at times.

492
00:41:55.259 --> 00:41:57.059
But also so damn destructive.

493
00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:01.530
Was it right after we saw her?

494
00:42:02.533 --> 00:42:05.633
Oh, no. Wait, wait, wait.
This has nothing to do with you.

495
00:42:05.736 --> 00:42:08.636
It's not your problem,
so don't let yourself be distracted.

496
00:42:08.839 --> 00:42:12.039
This is your moment, Nina.

497
00:42:13.444 --> 00:42:14.644
Don't let it go.

498
00:43:44.467 --> 00:43:45.467
What are you doing?

499
00:45:27.137 --> 00:45:28.037
Nina?

500
00:45:29.607 --> 00:45:31.307
Sweetie, are you ready for me?

501
00:45:41.385 --> 00:45:42.285
And...

502
00:45:44.154 --> 00:45:44.980
Come on.

503
00:45:44.982 --> 00:45:47.682
Forget about control, Nina.
I want to see passion.

504
00:45:48.125 --> 00:45:49.125
Come on.

505
00:45:49.693 --> 00:45:50.693
Reach.

506
00:45:51.328 --> 00:45:53.074
More! You're stiff.

507
00:45:53.076 --> 00:45:55.288
Stiff like a dead corpse.
Let it go.

508
00:45:55.566 --> 00:45:56.521
Let it go.

509
00:45:56.623 --> 00:45:57.667
Let it go.

510
00:45:58.202 --> 00:45:59.836
And again.

511
00:46:00.037 --> 00:46:01.437
It feels like you have a...

512
00:46:01.939 --> 00:46:04.439
your diaphragm is in a bit of a...

513
00:46:05.073 --> 00:46:06.373
contraction.
Ok.

514
00:46:11.115 --> 00:46:12.755
I want you to breathe into this hand.

515
00:46:12.757 --> 00:46:13.550
Breathe into this hand.

516
00:46:13.617 --> 00:46:16.051
Breathe in, breathe in,
breathe in. All the way.

517
00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:19.612
Good. And exhale.

518
00:46:22.559 --> 00:46:25.289
Does it feel jammed in the front
every time you plié?

519
00:46:25.462 --> 00:46:27.162
Sometimes. Not always.

520
00:46:30.801 --> 00:46:32.701
One more pull. Ok?
Ok.

521
00:46:37.641 --> 00:46:38.741
Is that ok?

522
00:46:59.229 --> 00:47:01.229
David, can I ask you a question?

523
00:47:01.732 --> 00:47:03.597
Honestly, would you fuck that girl?

524
00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:07.670
No.

525
00:47:07.938 --> 00:47:09.238
No one would.

526
00:47:10.441 --> 00:47:11.417
Nina,

527
00:47:11.619 --> 00:47:13.873
your dancing is just as frigid...

528
00:47:15.879 --> 00:47:16.879
Fuck!

529
00:47:21.752 --> 00:47:23.867
We're still working here, please.
Light!

530
00:47:24.269 --> 00:47:25.269
The lights!

531
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:27.490
Thank you.

532
00:47:28.658 --> 00:47:31.159
Ok, guys, you can go.
Thanks for your patience.

533
00:47:31.561 --> 00:47:33.161
Na-da-da-da-da. You stay.

534
00:47:33.363 --> 00:47:34.363
You stay.

535
00:47:36.332 --> 00:47:37.432
Have fun, you two.

536
00:47:38.334 --> 00:47:39.334
Hey, oh.

537
00:47:41.105 --> 00:47:43.266
Ok. Come here.

538
00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:44.440
Come, come, come, come.

539
00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:48.210
I'll be the prince.

540
00:48:09.132 --> 00:48:10.632
Let it go. Let it go.

541
00:48:31.922 --> 00:48:34.206
Feel my touch.
Respond to it.

542
00:48:34.908 --> 00:48:35.908
Come on.

543
00:48:47.437 --> 00:48:48.662
Open your mouth.

544
00:48:49.064 --> 00:48:50.864
Open your mouth.
Open it. Open it.

545
00:48:51.408 --> 00:48:52.408
Open it.

546
00:49:17.534 --> 00:49:19.134
That was me seducing you...

547
00:49:19.769 --> 00:49:21.669
when it needs to be
the other way around.

548
00:49:22.206 --> 00:49:23.206
Please.

549
00:49:46.529 --> 00:49:47.829
Who is that?

550
00:49:48.599 --> 00:49:49.599
Hey.

551
00:49:51.869 --> 00:49:52.969
You ok?

552
00:49:55.005 --> 00:49:56.605
You can't smoke in here.

553
00:49:57.341 --> 00:50:00.441
Well, I won't tell if you won't.

554
00:50:03.146 --> 00:50:04.146
So...

555
00:50:05.014 --> 00:50:07.414
big day's getting closer and closer?

556
00:50:09.152 --> 00:50:11.952
Well, I can't wait.
I think you're gonna be...

557
00:50:12.003 --> 00:50:13.003
amazing.

558
00:50:14.691 --> 00:50:15.691
Thanks.

559
00:50:20.597 --> 00:50:21.597
Come on.

560
00:50:30.641 --> 00:50:31.801
So...

561
00:50:32.876 --> 00:50:34.576
do you want to talk about it?

562
00:50:36.246 --> 00:50:38.346
I just had a hard day.

563
00:50:40.416 --> 00:50:42.016
Leroy playing
a little too rough for you?

564
00:50:43.553 --> 00:50:45.153
Come on, Nina. He's a prick.

565
00:50:45.855 --> 00:50:47.055
He's brilliant.

566
00:50:47.224 --> 00:50:48.320
Sure.

567
00:50:48.322 --> 00:50:50.422
But it's not like he's all warm
and fuzzy.

568
00:50:52.162 --> 00:50:53.662
Well, you don't know him.

569
00:50:56.533 --> 00:50:58.333
Someone's hot for teacher.

570
00:51:00.637 --> 00:51:02.837
Come on. It's ok.
I don't blame you.

571
00:51:02.939 --> 00:51:04.130
I should go home.

572
00:51:04.732 --> 00:51:07.232
Nina, come on.
I'm just playing around.

573
00:51:08.845 --> 00:51:09.845
Nina.

574
00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:31.478
Sweetie?

575
00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:33.380
What are you doing in there?

576
00:53:01.658 --> 00:53:02.658
Again.

577
00:53:35.692 --> 00:53:36.692
Again.

578
00:53:48.171 --> 00:53:50.071
Do you have any corrections?

579
00:53:55.178 --> 00:53:57.146
Lily told me that she saw you crying.

580
00:53:59.015 --> 00:54:00.862
That you were very upset,

581
00:54:00.864 --> 00:54:02.964
and that I should take it easy on you.

582
00:54:03.286 --> 00:54:04.786
I didn't tell her that.

583
00:54:05.422 --> 00:54:07.114
Maybe you need a little break,

584
00:54:07.116 --> 00:54:08.483
like a day or two.
Thomas.

585
00:54:08.558 --> 00:54:09.927
Or a month? What do you think?

586
00:54:09.929 --> 00:54:10.857
She shouldn't have said anything.

587
00:54:10.927 --> 00:54:13.281
No, you shouldn't be whining
in the first place.

588
00:54:13.283 --> 00:54:14.122
I didn't!

589
00:54:17.467 --> 00:54:18.714
You could be brilliant,

590
00:54:19.816 --> 00:54:20.916
but you're a coward.

591
00:54:22.038 --> 00:54:24.336
I'm sorry.
Now stop saying that!

592
00:54:24.407 --> 00:54:25.834
That's exactly what I'm talking about!

593
00:54:25.836 --> 00:54:27.172
Stop being so fucking weak!

594
00:54:27.444 --> 00:54:28.444
Again!

595
00:54:41.458 --> 00:54:42.458
Lily?

596
00:54:42.959 --> 00:54:45.559
Look who's decided to grace us
with her presence.

597
00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:46.767
I need to talk to you.

598
00:54:46.769 --> 00:54:47.769
Ok.

599
00:54:48.165 --> 00:54:49.165
Now!

600
00:54:49.966 --> 00:54:52.166
Shut up. Come on.

601
00:54:55.672 --> 00:54:56.872
What's up?

602
00:54:57.407 --> 00:54:59.407
You told Thomas about last night?

603
00:55:00.976 --> 00:55:02.358
Yeah, I ran into him in the morning.

604
00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:03.960
He said you guys were having
some trouble.

605
00:55:04.013 --> 00:55:05.213
Why would he talk to you?

606
00:55:06.183 --> 00:55:07.883
Excuse me, Your Highness.

607
00:55:08.585 --> 00:55:11.185
I told him you were working
your ass off and that you'll be great.

608
00:55:11.221 --> 00:55:12.721
Well, you shouldn't have.

609
00:55:16.891 --> 00:55:17.891
Ok.

610
00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:52.060
Has he tried anything with you?

611
00:55:55.999 --> 00:55:57.799
He has a reputation.

612
00:56:01.671 --> 00:56:03.536
I have a right to be concerned, Nina.

613
00:56:03.537 --> 00:56:06.237
You've been staying late
so many nights, rehearsing.

614
00:56:07.244 --> 00:56:09.444
I hope he isn't taking advantage.
That's all.

615
00:56:09.713 --> 00:56:10.813
He's not.

616
00:56:11.437 --> 00:56:12.437
Good.

617
00:56:14.884 --> 00:56:17.284
I just don't want you to make
the same mistake I did.

618
00:56:18.355 --> 00:56:19.355
Thanks.

619
00:56:20.257 --> 00:56:21.550
Not like that.

620
00:56:22.352 --> 00:56:24.752
I just mean as far as
my career was concerned.

621
00:56:24.861 --> 00:56:25.961
What career?

622
00:56:29.132 --> 00:56:31.032
The one I gave up to have you.

623
00:56:33.136 --> 00:56:34.636
You were 28.

624
00:56:35.372 --> 00:56:36.272
So?

625
00:56:36.806 --> 00:56:38.306
And only in the...

626
00:56:39.776 --> 00:56:41.016
Only what?

627
00:56:42.045 --> 00:56:43.345
Nothing.
What?

628
00:56:43.546 --> 00:56:44.546
Nothing.

629
00:56:47.517 --> 00:56:49.017
How's your skin?

630
00:56:49.886 --> 00:56:50.886
It's fine.

631
00:56:51.254 --> 00:56:52.754
Are we leaving it alone?

632
00:56:55.191 --> 00:56:56.591
Let me see.

633
00:57:00.930 --> 00:57:02.830
Take off your shirt.
No.

634
00:57:15.445 --> 00:57:18.107
Can I help you?
Is Nina around?

635
00:57:18.181 --> 00:57:19.781
Sorry. She's not here.

636
00:57:21.050 --> 00:57:22.050
Who was that?

637
00:57:22.485 --> 00:57:23.585
It was no one.

638
00:57:25.455 --> 00:57:26.455
It was no one!

639
00:57:31.061 --> 00:57:32.061
Hello?

640
00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:34.590
Hey.

641
00:57:36.633 --> 00:57:37.933
What are you doing here?

642
00:57:37.934 --> 00:57:39.641
I just came by to apologize.

643
00:57:39.643 --> 00:57:41.743
You're right. I should have
never spoken to him about you.

644
00:57:42.172 --> 00:57:43.867
Sweetheart?
Give me a second.

645
00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:45.440
Your dinner.
Mom, please!

646
00:57:48.110 --> 00:57:49.110
She's a trip.

647
00:57:49.145 --> 00:57:50.745
How do you know where I live?

648
00:57:51.848 --> 00:57:53.248
I have my ways.

649
00:57:55.084 --> 00:57:56.084
Jesus, relax.

650
00:57:56.152 --> 00:57:57.752
I got it from Susie in the office.

651
00:57:59.089 --> 00:58:01.272
Yeah I just, I feel really shitty
about what I did,

652
00:58:01.274 --> 00:58:02.558
and I just want to make it up to you.

653
00:58:02.559 --> 00:58:04.513
So how about I take you out to dinner?

654
00:58:05.115 --> 00:58:07.055
I don't think-
Ok, that's fine.

655
00:58:07.057 --> 00:58:08.070
What about...

656
00:58:08.672 --> 00:58:09.672
drinks?

657
00:58:10.734 --> 00:58:12.234
Sweetie, you need to rest.

658
00:58:12.736 --> 00:58:14.436
Jesus.
Wait.

659
00:58:15.772 --> 00:58:16.872
What are you doing?

660
00:58:17.907 --> 00:58:19.465
Going out.
What?

661
00:58:19.542 --> 00:58:20.975
Stairs.
Nina!

662
00:58:21.144 --> 00:58:22.944
You're on the stage tomorrow!

663
00:58:24.848 --> 00:58:26.577
I can't believe he calls her that.

664
00:58:26.579 --> 00:58:27.875
It's so gross.

665
00:58:27.951 --> 00:58:29.451
I think it's sweet.

666
00:58:29.652 --> 00:58:31.210
Little princess?

667
00:58:31.212 --> 00:58:32.654
He probably calls every girl that.

668
00:58:32.655 --> 00:58:33.755
No way.

669
00:58:34.272 --> 00:58:35.420
That's just for Beth.

670
00:58:36.226 --> 00:58:40.128
I bet he'll be calling you
little princess any day now.

671
00:58:40.229 --> 00:58:41.729
I don't know about that.

672
00:58:41.798 --> 00:58:43.440
Oh, sure, he will.

673
00:58:43.442 --> 00:58:45.068
You just gotta let him lick your pussy.

674
00:58:46.202 --> 00:58:48.261
Cheeseburger, extra bloody.

675
00:58:48.738 --> 00:58:50.138
Danke schön.

676
00:58:51.541 --> 00:58:53.566
Let me know if that's
juicy enough for you.

677
00:58:54.143 --> 00:58:55.343
I will.

678
00:58:57.414 --> 00:58:59.014
You got enough, cheese?

679
00:59:00.016 --> 00:59:01.616
No, but you do.

680
00:59:03.887 --> 00:59:04.887
Enjoy.

681
00:59:15.131 --> 00:59:16.131
Ok.

682
00:59:22.539 --> 00:59:23.839
Wanna spruce up?

683
00:59:24.974 --> 00:59:26.874
What? I carry a spare.

684
00:59:28.344 --> 00:59:30.144
In case I wake up
somewhere unexpected.

685
00:59:34.217 --> 00:59:36.017
So, how is he?

686
00:59:38.221 --> 00:59:39.221
Thomas.

687
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:42.290
I wouldn't know.

688
00:59:43.058 --> 00:59:43.815
Oh, come on.

689
00:59:44.217 --> 00:59:45.717
I really don't want to talk about that.

690
00:59:48.196 --> 00:59:49.196
Ok.

691
00:59:50.667 --> 00:59:52.967
You really need to relax.

692
01:00:00.677 --> 01:00:02.349
One for you,

693
01:00:02.751 --> 01:00:03.951
one for me.

694
01:00:05.647 --> 01:00:07.532
And don't worry it's pure.
I promise.

695
01:00:07.533 --> 01:00:09.433
I brought it with me
straight from San Francisco.

696
01:00:11.621 --> 01:00:12.721
What is it?

697
01:00:13.690 --> 01:00:14.890
What, are you kidding?

698
01:00:16.392 --> 01:00:17.792
You've never rolled?

699
01:00:20.496 --> 01:00:23.496
It'll relax you.
It'll loosen you up.

700
01:00:25.301 --> 01:00:27.201
Let you see the night sky.

701
01:00:31.241 --> 01:00:32.799
How long does it last?

702
01:00:33.476 --> 01:00:34.876
Couple hours, tops.

703
01:00:40.449 --> 01:00:41.449
It's ok.

704
01:00:42.585 --> 01:00:43.585
Ok.

705
01:01:28.498 --> 01:01:30.966
I was...
That's very sweet of you.

706
01:01:32.669 --> 01:01:34.369
Will you bring the drinks?

707
01:01:46.414 --> 01:01:47.614
Hey!
Hi!

708
01:01:47.683 --> 01:01:50.156
I thought maybe you and I
could use a couple drinks.

709
01:01:50.158 --> 01:01:50.930
I'm gonna head out.
So...

710
01:01:50.932 --> 01:01:54.432
This is Tom and this is Jerry.

711
01:01:54.924 --> 01:01:56.537
Actually, it's Andrew.

712
01:01:56.839 --> 01:01:57.739
Tom.

713
01:01:57.827 --> 01:01:58.438
Hi.

714
01:01:58.940 --> 01:01:59.826
I have to go.
Oh no.

715
01:01:59.828 --> 01:02:01.928
Come on, you can't go.
I just got us some drinks.

716
01:02:02.699 --> 01:02:03.799
I shouldn't.

717
01:02:04.033 --> 01:02:05.557
We're on the stage tomorrow.

718
01:02:05.835 --> 01:02:08.035
So, what are you gonna do?
Go home to Mommy?

719
01:02:10.239 --> 01:02:10.959
Hey.

720
01:02:11.261 --> 01:02:12.961
Come on. Live a little.

721
01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:19.440
It's just a couple hours, right?

722
01:02:20.149 --> 01:02:21.309
Tops.

723
01:02:23.686 --> 01:02:25.779
Hey. There you go.
Thank you.

724
01:02:25.855 --> 01:02:26.855
Cheers.
Cheers.

725
01:02:28.658 --> 01:02:30.463
You haven't told me who you are.

726
01:02:31.565 --> 01:02:32.665
I'm a dancer.

727
01:02:32.695 --> 01:02:34.595
No, I mean your name.

728
01:02:35.431 --> 01:02:36.431
Nina.

729
01:02:36.566 --> 01:02:37.496
So, are you two sisters?

730
01:02:37.498 --> 01:02:38.193
No.
Yes.

731
01:02:38.995 --> 01:02:40.295
Blood sisters.

732
01:02:40.370 --> 01:02:42.670
We dance in the same company.

733
01:02:43.505 --> 01:02:44.549
Ballerinas.

734
01:02:44.551 --> 01:02:46.251
No wonder you two look alike.

735
01:02:46.409 --> 01:02:49.207
You know, Tom and Jerry here
are gay lovers.

736
01:02:49.678 --> 01:02:51.678
Very funny.
I like to amuse myself.

737
01:02:51.847 --> 01:02:53.447
I've never been to the ballet.
Oh, really?

738
01:02:53.583 --> 01:02:55.676
Oh, well, then you are definitely not gay.

739
01:02:55.952 --> 01:02:57.762
I mean, it's kind of boring though?

740
01:02:57.764 --> 01:02:59.064
Isn't it?
No, it's not.

741
01:02:59.065 --> 01:03:02.114
No. You know what, it's just.
It's not for everyone.

742
01:03:02.191 --> 01:03:04.991
You guys should come sometime.
I can comp you tickets whenever you want.

743
01:03:05.194 --> 01:03:06.294
Yeah.
Yeah.

744
01:03:07.096 --> 01:03:08.853
That would be, neat.
Ok.

745
01:03:08.855 --> 01:03:10.955
Well I think it is time
for another round.

746
01:03:11.967 --> 01:03:12.967
Bottoms up.

747
01:03:16.939 --> 01:03:18.027
Four, please.

748
01:03:18.729 --> 01:03:20.329
So, what are you guys working on now?

749
01:03:21.911 --> 01:03:22.911
I'm sorry.

750
01:03:26.515 --> 01:03:28.315
Swan Lake.
Ok.

751
01:03:28.718 --> 01:03:29.718
Yeah?

752
01:03:30.253 --> 01:03:31.982
You know it?
No.

753
01:03:32.255 --> 01:03:33.133
Not really.

754
01:03:33.435 --> 01:03:34.435
Heard of it.

755
01:03:34.524 --> 01:03:35.824
What's it about?

756
01:03:36.926 --> 01:03:39.326
It's about a girl
who gets turned into a swan...

757
01:03:39.429 --> 01:03:42.029
and she needs love to break the spell.

758
01:03:43.032 --> 01:03:43.932
Ok.

759
01:03:44.267 --> 01:03:46.467
But her prince falls
for the wrong girl and...

760
01:03:49.238 --> 01:03:50.738
so she kills herself.

761
01:03:52.341 --> 01:03:53.941
So, a happy ending then.

762
01:03:54.911 --> 01:03:56.811
It's beautiful actually.

763
01:03:59.916 --> 01:04:01.016
Like you.

764
01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:06.020
I said, you're beautiful.

765
01:04:09.391 --> 01:04:10.391
That's funny?

766
01:04:12.095 --> 01:04:13.895
My hands are sweaty.

767
01:04:14.497 --> 01:04:15.597
Hey.

768
01:04:16.699 --> 01:04:18.599
Oh, hey.

769
01:04:19.602 --> 01:04:22.502
It looks like someone might be rolling.

770
01:04:23.139 --> 01:04:26.239
Alright, come on. Come on.
It's time to go dance.

771
01:04:43.526 --> 01:04:46.586
<i>Sweet girl. Sweet girl. Sweet girl.</i>

772
01:04:46.662 --> 01:04:49.222
Hey! Nina!

773
01:05:26.435 --> 01:05:27.908
Hey, what the fuck?

774
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:29.010
Where you going?

775
01:05:51.594 --> 01:05:52.594
Nina!

776
01:05:52.862 --> 01:05:54.762
Where are you going?

777
01:07:17.313 --> 01:07:19.913
Do you have any idea what time it is?

778
01:07:21.450 --> 01:07:22.610
Late.

779
01:07:25.154 --> 01:07:26.553
Where have you been?

780
01:07:27.423 --> 01:07:29.391
To the moon and back.

781
01:07:31.694 --> 01:07:33.992
You've been drinking.
Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding!

782
01:07:34.363 --> 01:07:35.363
What else?

783
01:07:35.765 --> 01:07:37.965
What else have you been doing?

784
01:07:39.801 --> 01:07:41.601
You want to know their names?

785
01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:45.498
You need to sleep this off.

786
01:07:45.499 --> 01:07:45.995
There were two.

787
01:07:45.997 --> 01:07:47.957
There was Tom and there was Jerry.

788
01:07:47.958 --> 01:07:48.670
Be quiet, Nina!

789
01:07:49.044 --> 01:07:50.844
And I fucked them both.

790
01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:52.180
Shut your mouth!

791
01:08:05.227 --> 01:08:07.092
Don't come in here!
What's this?

792
01:08:07.163 --> 01:08:09.791
It's called privacy!
I'm not 12 anymore!

793
01:08:09.865 --> 01:08:12.665
You're not my Nina right now.
Leave me alone!

794
01:10:09.652 --> 01:10:11.085
Sweet girl.

795
01:11:08.277 --> 01:11:09.977
Why didn't you wake me up?

796
01:11:12.081 --> 01:11:13.581
I'm moving out.

797
01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:19.320
My music.

798
01:11:36.472 --> 01:11:38.272
Thomas, I am so sorry.

799
01:11:38.607 --> 01:11:39.907
Keep on going.

800
01:11:41.543 --> 01:11:42.743
Go get warmed up.

801
01:12:25.254 --> 01:12:26.454
That was good.

802
01:12:28.290 --> 01:12:29.518
Actually, really good.

803
01:12:29.792 --> 01:12:31.885
Ok, let's take 10.

804
01:12:37.132 --> 01:12:38.332
Hey.

805
01:12:39.902 --> 01:12:42.302
Look, he just wanted to work it
and asked me to step in. Ok?

806
01:12:42.972 --> 01:12:44.472
I overslept.

807
01:12:45.774 --> 01:12:48.174
Well, hey, at least
you had a good time, right?

808
01:12:48.377 --> 01:12:50.105
You put something in my drink.

809
01:12:50.707 --> 01:12:51.507
Yeah.

810
01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:53.580
And then you just took off
in the morning?

811
01:12:54.383 --> 01:12:55.685
In the morning?

812
01:12:56.087 --> 01:12:57.487
Yeah. You slept over.

813
01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:00.720
No.

814
01:13:02.191 --> 01:13:04.691
Unless your name is Tom,
and you got a dick.

815
01:13:05.527 --> 01:13:06.727
But we...

816
01:13:07.563 --> 01:13:09.063
But we what, Nina?

817
01:13:14.236 --> 01:13:18.036
Wh... Did you have some sort
of lezzie wet dream about me?

818
01:13:18.173 --> 01:13:19.199
Stop.

819
01:13:19.201 --> 01:13:20.472
Oh, my God!

820
01:13:20.542 --> 01:13:23.778
Oh, my God! You did!
You fantasized about me!

821
01:13:23.779 --> 01:13:24.552
Shut up!

822
01:13:25.354 --> 01:13:26.454
Was I good?

823
01:15:09.685 --> 01:15:10.985
The final act!

824
01:15:11.587 --> 01:15:13.287
Your final dance!

825
01:15:15.457 --> 01:15:17.167
You tasted your dream!

826
01:15:17.769 --> 01:15:18.858
Touched it!

827
01:15:21.296 --> 01:15:22.796
Only to have it crushed.

828
01:15:26.802 --> 01:15:28.402
Your heart is broken!

829
01:15:28.871 --> 01:15:29.871
Wounded!

830
01:15:30.472 --> 01:15:32.172
Your life force fading.

831
01:15:32.674 --> 01:15:34.174
The blood drips.

832
01:15:37.513 --> 01:15:39.105
The black swan stole your love!

833
01:15:39.481 --> 01:15:42.281
There's only one way to end the pain!

834
01:15:43.919 --> 01:15:45.403
You're not fearful,

835
01:15:45.405 --> 01:15:47.405
but filled with acceptance!

836
01:15:49.191 --> 01:15:52.091
And you look down at Rothbart...

837
01:15:53.095 --> 01:15:54.695
and then at the prince...

838
01:15:55.998 --> 01:15:57.998
and then yes, at the audience.

839
01:15:59.835 --> 01:16:01.335
And then you jump!

840
01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:08.140
Come on, go ahead. Jump.
You'll be fine. Jump!

841
01:16:18.654 --> 01:16:21.054
Ok, everybody gets a drink of water.

842
01:16:21.223 --> 01:16:22.223
Then it's notes?

843
01:16:34.236 --> 01:16:35.528
You lost weight.

844
01:16:35.730 --> 01:16:37.230
Take off your shrug, please.

845
01:16:43.946 --> 01:16:45.607
Ok.

846
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:49.950
Very good.

847
01:16:56.024 --> 01:16:58.458
Face front. We're almost done.

848
01:17:02.097 --> 01:17:03.655
And that's it.

849
01:17:03.832 --> 01:17:05.639
Ok, you're done.

850
01:17:05.641 --> 01:17:06.641
Thank you very much.

851
01:17:08.704 --> 01:17:10.137
Georgina?
Yes.

852
01:17:10.205 --> 01:17:12.002
I'm Lily.
Thomas said I should come.

853
01:17:12.074 --> 01:17:14.874
Yes, we have to get you measured
for your Swan Queen costumes.

854
01:17:15.077 --> 01:17:16.277
What's she doing here?

855
01:17:17.946 --> 01:17:19.546
He made me your alternate.

856
01:17:21.383 --> 01:17:22.883
Look, it's just in case.

857
01:17:25.187 --> 01:17:27.112
Thomas. Thomas!

858
01:17:27.656 --> 01:17:28.956
Thomas!
Yes?

859
01:17:29.825 --> 01:17:30.870
It can't be her.

860
01:17:31.172 --> 01:17:32.272
It can't be her.

861
01:17:32.561 --> 01:17:34.661
Ok, why don't you just go?
I'll catch up later.

862
01:17:35.330 --> 01:17:37.030
What's going on?
Lily.

863
01:17:37.833 --> 01:17:39.333
You made her my alternate?

864
01:17:40.569 --> 01:17:42.594
Well, there is always an alternate.

865
01:17:42.871 --> 01:17:44.871
Lily is the best choice.
No, but she wants my role.

866
01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:47.591
Every dancer in the world wants your role.

867
01:17:47.593 --> 01:17:48.693
No, this is different.

868
01:17:48.810 --> 01:17:50.110
She's after me.

869
01:17:50.245 --> 01:17:52.445
She's trying to replace me.
Nobody's after you.

870
01:17:53.581 --> 01:17:54.981
No, please believe me.

871
01:17:55.117 --> 01:17:56.117
Hey.

872
01:17:58.853 --> 01:18:00.253
I know it's been a struggle.

873
01:18:00.789 --> 01:18:01.789
Yeah.

874
01:18:02.391 --> 01:18:04.191
But you just had
a breakthrough this morning.

875
01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:06.687
Tomorrow's yours.

876
01:18:06.689 --> 01:18:08.089
Just give a great performance

877
01:18:08.090 --> 01:18:10.562
and you won't have to worry
about Lily or anybody else.

878
01:18:14.002 --> 01:18:15.402
Now go home and rest.

879
01:18:28.884 --> 01:18:30.284
From the vision again.

880
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:49.570
What happened?

881
01:18:50.872 --> 01:18:52.172
I've got a life.

882
01:18:52.841 --> 01:18:54.174
Don't work too hard.

883
01:18:54.176 --> 01:18:55.310
It's your big day tomorrow.

884
01:19:36.585 --> 01:19:37.585
Hey.

885
01:19:39.621 --> 01:19:41.521
I'm still working in here.

886
01:19:51.366 --> 01:19:53.459
Could you please
turn the lights back on?

887
01:19:58.940 --> 01:19:59.940
Hello?

888
01:21:47.916 --> 01:21:49.357
What are you doing here?

889
01:21:49.759 --> 01:21:50.959
I'm so sorry.

890
01:21:52.154 --> 01:21:53.554
I'm so sorry.

891
01:21:54.055 --> 01:21:55.855
I know how it feels now.

892
01:21:56.391 --> 01:21:58.154
She's trying to replace me.

893
01:21:58.626 --> 01:22:00.126
What do I do?

894
01:22:02.364 --> 01:22:04.628
You stole my things?

895
01:22:05.599 --> 01:22:07.799
I was just trying to be perfect like you.

896
01:22:09.971 --> 01:22:11.302
Perfect?

897
01:22:16.645 --> 01:22:18.645
No, I'm not perfect.

898
01:22:20.682 --> 01:22:22.182
I'm nothing.

899
01:22:24.953 --> 01:22:26.682
Nothing!

900
01:22:26.755 --> 01:22:28.955
Nothing! Nothing!

901
01:22:30.392 --> 01:22:31.392
No!

902
01:22:35.897 --> 01:22:37.660
Nothing! Nothing!
No!

903
01:22:37.732 --> 01:22:39.932
Nothing! Nothing!

904
01:23:24.446 --> 01:23:25.746
Sweet girl.

905
01:23:46.801 --> 01:23:47.801
Mommy?

906
01:23:51.206 --> 01:23:53.506
Sweet girl. Sweet girl.

907
01:23:53.842 --> 01:23:55.969
It's my turn.
It's my turn.

908
01:23:56.044 --> 01:23:57.344
It's my turn.

909
01:23:58.212 --> 01:23:59.812
Stop!

910
01:24:09.424 --> 01:24:10.524
What are you doing?

911
01:24:12.527 --> 01:24:13.627
Sweetie?

912
01:24:20.402 --> 01:24:21.402
Nina!

913
01:24:22.938 --> 01:24:23.815
Nina!

914
01:24:24.117 --> 01:24:25.207
Go away!

915
01:24:26.373 --> 01:24:27.473
Open the door!

916
01:24:27.642 --> 01:24:28.942
Go away!

917
01:24:37.885 --> 01:24:39.685
Open the door, Nina!

918
01:24:40.487 --> 01:24:41.487
Nina!

919
01:24:45.792 --> 01:24:46.692
Nina!

920
01:24:53.902 --> 01:24:54.809
Get out!

921
01:24:55.111 --> 01:24:56.261
What's wrong with you?

922
01:24:56.304 --> 01:24:57.269
Get out!

923
01:24:57.271 --> 01:24:58.297
You're sick!

924
01:24:58.373 --> 01:25:00.032
Get out!
You're sick!

925
01:25:00.034 --> 01:25:01.734
Get out!
Nina!

926
01:25:39.646 --> 01:25:40.646
It's ok.

927
01:25:41.649 --> 01:25:42.949
I'm here.

928
01:25:46.488 --> 01:25:48.588
You were scratching all night.

929
01:25:49.958 --> 01:25:51.687
Where's my clock?

930
01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:54.090
Don't worry about that.
What time is it?

931
01:25:55.362 --> 01:25:56.562
My show is tonight.

932
01:25:56.563 --> 01:25:57.664
No, no, no.
I have to.

933
01:25:57.766 --> 01:25:58.528
No, don't worry.

934
01:25:59.030 --> 01:26:01.330
I called the theater and I told them
you weren't feeling well.

935
01:26:01.970 --> 01:26:03.733
I have to go.
No, no, lie down.

936
01:26:03.805 --> 01:26:04.805
Let go of me.

937
01:26:07.308 --> 01:26:09.105
You're staying in here
until you feel better.

938
01:26:09.677 --> 01:26:10.877
Where is it?

939
01:26:12.213 --> 01:26:13.737
This role's destroying you.

940
01:26:15.083 --> 01:26:16.717
Move.
Nina.

941
01:26:16.718 --> 01:26:17.398
Move!

942
01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:18.900
What happened to my sweet girl?

943
01:26:19.754 --> 01:26:20.948
She's gone!

944
01:26:21.922 --> 01:26:22.922
Nina!

945
01:26:22.924 --> 01:26:25.552
Oh, Nina! Oh, no! Please!

946
01:26:25.727 --> 01:26:27.854
You're not well!
Let go of me!

947
01:26:28.029 --> 01:26:30.229
You can't handle this!
I can't?

948
01:26:31.566 --> 01:26:32.899
I'm the Swan Queen!

949
01:26:32.967 --> 01:26:34.567
You're the one
who never left the corps.

950
01:26:35.703 --> 01:26:36.703
Nina!

951
01:26:44.279 --> 01:26:45.940
It's Nina.

952
01:26:48.216 --> 01:26:50.650
I have complete
confidence in you. Ok?

953
01:26:50.718 --> 01:26:52.948
Stay focused, and you'll be fine.
This is your moment.

954
01:26:53.021 --> 01:26:54.221
What are you doing here?

955
01:26:54.456 --> 01:26:55.147
Nina?

956
01:26:55.423 --> 01:26:57.125
You're suppose...
She was supposed to be sick!

957
01:26:57.126 --> 01:26:57.817
Wait, wait, wait.

958
01:26:58.119 --> 01:26:59.119
Give us a minute.

959
01:27:04.132 --> 01:27:05.053
Are you ok?

960
01:27:05.655 --> 01:27:06.655
I'm fine.

961
01:27:08.836 --> 01:27:10.036
Nina. Nina.

962
01:27:12.974 --> 01:27:14.102
Nina.

963
01:27:14.704 --> 01:27:15.604
What?

964
01:27:16.277 --> 01:27:17.977
I've already asked Lily.

965
01:27:18.813 --> 01:27:20.337
Have you announced it?

966
01:27:24.018 --> 01:27:26.408
After Beth, do you really
need another controversy?

967
01:27:30.592 --> 01:27:31.992
I'm here, Thomas.

968
01:27:32.861 --> 01:27:34.061
I'm doing it.

969
01:27:40.001 --> 01:27:42.901
The only person
standing in your way is you.

970
01:27:43.872 --> 01:27:45.472
It's time to let her go.

971
01:27:46.307 --> 01:27:47.707
Lose yourself.

972
01:28:02.189 --> 01:28:04.189
White swan, entrance in 10.

973
01:28:57.978 --> 01:28:59.778
What are you doing?
You need to be upstage.

974
01:30:57.865 --> 01:30:58.865
Hey.

975
01:31:00.902 --> 01:31:02.202
We sucked!

976
01:31:03.304 --> 01:31:04.404
Ok, Nina.

977
01:31:44.011 --> 01:31:45.011
What the fuck?

978
01:32:29.857 --> 01:32:31.241
Are you ok?
Nina, are you ok?

979
01:32:31.243 --> 01:32:32.293
What happened?

980
01:32:41.235 --> 01:32:43.035
Can you tell me
what the fuck happened?

981
01:32:43.136 --> 01:32:44.636
It not my fault.
How's that it not your fault?

982
01:32:44.737 --> 01:32:46.437
It's not the fault of the black lino.
It's slippery.

983
01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:47.754
It wasn't my fault.

984
01:32:47.856 --> 01:32:49.156
He dropped me.
It's a disaster!

985
01:32:49.257 --> 01:32:51.057
Fuck, how I could trust him.

986
01:32:51.458 --> 01:32:52.858
Once not two, Christian.

987
01:32:56.650 --> 01:32:57.600
Rough start?

988
01:32:58.502 --> 01:33:00.402
Must have been pretty humiliating.

989
01:33:01.922 --> 01:33:03.322
Get out of my room.

990
01:33:03.691 --> 01:33:05.991
See, I'm just worried about
the next act.

991
01:33:07.428 --> 01:33:09.128
I'm just not sure you're feeling up to it.

992
01:33:09.263 --> 01:33:10.787
Stop. Please stop.

993
01:33:11.265 --> 01:33:12.465
How about...

994
01:33:13.134 --> 01:33:16.234
I dance the black swan for you?

995
01:33:18.372 --> 01:33:19.772
Leave me alone!

996
01:33:32.220 --> 01:33:33.820
It's my turn!

997
01:33:34.188 --> 01:33:36.488
My turn! My turn!

998
01:33:42.396 --> 01:33:45.229
It's my turn!

999
01:34:05.551 --> 01:34:07.051
Black swan, places in five.

1000
01:37:09.503 --> 01:37:11.328
Get back out there!
Come on! They want you...

1001
01:37:38.933 --> 01:37:41.233
Great job.
Fifteen to the last act.

1002
01:38:26.946 --> 01:38:27.811
Hey!

1003
01:38:28.449 --> 01:38:30.449
You were amazing.

1004
01:38:30.751 --> 01:38:33.851
Seriously, I know that things got
a little messed up between us, but...

1005
01:38:34.221 --> 01:38:37.321
I mean, holy shit,
you completely blew me away!

1006
01:38:39.727 --> 01:38:41.020
Ok, well, I guess...

1007
01:38:41.422 --> 01:38:42.422
that's it.

1008
01:38:42.529 --> 01:38:43.629
So I'll. I'll let you finish.

1009
01:38:44.131 --> 01:38:45.131
Meh.

1010
01:42:08.934 --> 01:42:10.034
Can you hear them?

1011
01:42:10.503 --> 01:42:12.206
They love you!
They love you!

1012
01:42:13.100 --> 01:42:14.261
My little princess,

1013
01:42:14.270 --> 01:42:16.043
I always knew you had it in you.

1014
01:42:16.710 --> 01:42:18.810
Come on.
Let's take your bow.

1015
01:42:24.385 --> 01:42:26.216
Go get some help! Go get some help!

1016
01:42:26.986 --> 01:42:27.920
What did you do?

1017
01:42:28.222 --> 01:42:29.187
What did you do?

1018
01:42:30.657 --> 01:42:31.811
I felt it.

1019
01:42:32.113 --> 01:42:33.113
What?

1020
01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:34.960
Perfect.

1021
01:42:41.168 --> 01:42:42.468
It was perfect.

1022
01:42:50.069 --> 01:42:52.569
