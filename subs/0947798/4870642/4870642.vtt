1
00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.336
I had the craziest dream last night.

2
00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:01.686
I was dancing the White Swan.

3
00:04:03.444 --> 00:04:06.650
It was different choreography, though.
It was more like the Bolshoi's.

4
00:04:10.664 --> 00:04:12.291
It was the prologue,

5
00:04:12.326 --> 00:04:15.113
when Rothbart casts his spell.

6
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.538
Look how pink. So pretty...

7
00:04:27.573 --> 00:04:30.337
Pretty!

8
00:04:30.372 --> 00:04:34.397
- You're in a good mood.
- He promised to feature me more this season.

9
00:04:34.432 --> 00:04:36.610
Well, he certainly should.

10
00:04:36.645 --> 00:04:38.539
You've been there long enough,

11
00:04:38.574 --> 00:04:41.424
and you're the most dedicated
dancer in the company.

12
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.791
Up.

13
00:04:48.625 --> 00:04:49.660
- What's that?
- What?

14
00:04:49.695 --> 00:04:50.859
There.

15
00:04:54.668 --> 00:04:55.305
Nothing.

16
00:04:59.836 --> 00:05:01.227
You're sure you don't want me
to come with you?

17
00:05:04.531 --> 00:05:05.418
You're a sweet girl.

18
00:06:19.596 --> 00:06:20.673
Did you see Beth today?

19
00:06:20.708 --> 00:06:22.947
I can't believe she's back.

20
00:06:22.982 --> 00:06:26.330
- Of course she's back.
- What, she can't take a hint?

21
00:06:26.365 --> 00:06:29.568
The company is broke.
No one comes to see her anymore.

22
00:06:29.603 --> 00:06:32.255
Oh, nobody actually comes
to see ballet full stop.

23
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.672
That's not true. I heard The Royal
had one of their best seasons yet.

24
00:06:35.707 --> 00:06:37.623
He just needs to try something new.
That's all.

25
00:06:37.658 --> 00:06:40.325
No, someone new.

26
00:06:41.662 --> 00:06:44.496
- Like who?
- Like someone who's not approaching menopause.

27
00:06:44.531 --> 00:06:45.964
It's sad.

28
00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:47.631
What's sad?

29
00:06:51.964 --> 00:06:53.865
Beth's such a beautiful dancer.

30
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.436
Yeah, so is my grandmother.

31
00:06:56.691 --> 00:06:59.979
- Well Fonteyn danced into her fifties.
- Yeah, we know.

32
00:07:06.812 --> 00:07:07.405
Great.

33
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.932
Thought I'd fucking missed my stop.

34
00:07:09.967 --> 00:07:12.387
It's a hell-fit all the way from 79th.

35
00:08:04.126 --> 00:08:05.686
Beautiful as always, Nina.

36
00:08:05.721 --> 00:08:07.953
Relax.

37
00:08:12.675 --> 00:08:15.570
And one, and two,
and three, and four.

38
00:08:22.864 --> 00:08:24.094
Stop, John.
One second.

39
00:08:35.195 --> 00:08:36.881
Okay, take position.

40
00:08:36.916 --> 00:08:40.867
And one, and two,
and three, and up.

41
00:08:40.902 --> 00:08:44.326
And one, and two,
and three, and four.

42
00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:57.631
Hello, dear.

43
00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:07.305
We all know the story.

44
00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.050
Virginal girl, pure and sweet,

45
00:09:10.085 --> 00:09:12.720
trapped in the body of a swan.

46
00:09:12.755 --> 00:09:16.228
She desires freedom

47
00:09:16.263 --> 00:09:19.201
that only true love can break the spell.

48
00:09:22.072 --> 00:09:27.544
Her wish is nearly granted
in the form of a Prince.

49
00:09:27.579 --> 00:09:31.748
But before he can declare his love,

50
00:09:31.783 --> 00:09:37.863
The lustful twin, the Black Swan,
tricks and seduces him.

51
00:09:42.343 --> 00:09:47.742
Devastated,
the White Swan leaps off a cliff,

52
00:09:47.777 --> 00:09:52.706
killing herself.
And in death...

53
00:09:52.741 --> 00:09:55.533
finds freedom.

54
00:10:01.805 --> 00:10:04.119
- Good morning, company.
- Good morning.

55
00:10:06.084 --> 00:10:08.407
We will open our season
with <i>Swan Lake</i>.

56
00:10:08.442 --> 00:10:10.636
Done to death, I know.

57
00:10:10.671 --> 00:10:12.236
But not like this.

58
00:10:12.271 --> 00:10:17.134
We strip it down,
make it visceral and real.

59
00:10:19.174 --> 00:10:22.025
A new production
needs a new Swan Queen.

60
00:10:23.751 --> 00:10:25.774
A fresh face to present to the world.

61
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:33.009
But... Which of you
can embody both Swans?

62
00:10:34.144 --> 00:10:36.377
The White, and the Black.

63
00:10:43.052 --> 00:10:45.399
All the soloists I tapped:

64
00:10:46.263 --> 00:10:48.503
Go to your scheduled rehearsals
this afternoon.

65
00:10:51.319 --> 00:10:53.118
And the girls I didn't tap:

66
00:10:55.482 --> 00:10:57.428
Meet me in the principals' studio at 5:00.

67
00:10:57.463 --> 00:10:58.904
Thank you.

68
00:11:03.505 --> 00:11:04.193
All right.

69
00:11:04.228 --> 00:11:06.898
- Let's go. Did we do left side?
- Yes, mistress.

70
00:11:44.427 --> 00:11:45.012
Fuck! Fuck!

71
00:11:51.074 --> 00:11:51.716
What?

72
00:13:32.621 --> 00:13:35.424
If I was only casting the White Swan,
she'd be yours.

73
00:13:37.547 --> 00:13:38.446
But I'm not.

74
00:13:38.481 --> 00:13:41.222
Maestro, Odile's coda, please.

75
00:13:41.257 --> 00:13:42.999
Now show me your Black Swan, Nina.

76
00:14:06.947 --> 00:14:09.627
Not so controlled.
Seduce us.

77
00:14:09.662 --> 00:14:12.932
Not just the Prince, but the court,
the audience, the entire world.

78
00:14:12.967 --> 00:14:16.123
Come on,
like a spider spinning a web.

79
00:14:16.158 --> 00:14:18.614
Attack it, attack it!
Come on!

80
00:14:30.109 --> 00:14:30.720
Well...

81
00:14:30.755 --> 00:14:33.045
- Good of you to join us.
- Sorry...

82
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.930
Girls, this is Lily.

83
00:14:34.965 --> 00:14:38.539
Straight off the plane from San Francisco.
She's filling Rebecca's old spot.

84
00:14:38.574 --> 00:14:40.232
- Hey.
- Get warmed up.

85
00:14:40.267 --> 00:14:41.116
No, it's okay.

86
00:14:41.151 --> 00:14:42.323
I'm good.

87
00:14:44.895 --> 00:14:45.685
Should I go again?

88
00:14:47.316 --> 00:14:48.604
No, thanks, Nina.
I've seen enough.

89
00:14:52.338 --> 00:14:54.201
Veronica, the White Swan variation.

90
00:14:58.206 --> 00:14:59.090
Come on, come on, come on, please.

91
00:14:59.125 --> 00:15:02.016
All right, Maestro.

92
00:15:02.051 --> 00:15:04.750
Two, three...

93
00:16:11.466 --> 00:16:12.005
So how'd it go?

94
00:16:13.999 --> 00:16:16.000
You were late, so I called
Susie in the office.

95
00:16:16.035 --> 00:16:19.178
An audition! I can't believe
he just sprang that on you.

96
00:16:19.213 --> 00:16:21.386
So?

97
00:16:21.421 --> 00:16:23.213
It was fine.

98
00:16:23.248 --> 00:16:25.195
Just fine?

99
00:16:27.708 --> 00:16:28.837
Oh, sweetheart...

100
00:16:31.416 --> 00:16:32.669
You tell me about it.

101
00:17:26.983 --> 00:17:28.118
Nina, everything all right?

102
00:17:28.153 --> 00:17:29.159
I'm fine.

103
00:17:44.067 --> 00:17:44.780
Almost done.

104
00:17:44.815 --> 00:17:46.987
You're working yourself too hard.

105
00:17:49.356 --> 00:17:52.592
- We all have off days.
- That girl, um, barged in.

106
00:17:52.627 --> 00:17:54.465
I'm sure she didn't mean to.

107
00:17:57.699 --> 00:18:02.710
For a starter, if I hadn't taken you to each of
your classes, you'd have been completely lost.

108
00:18:02.745 --> 00:18:05.219
I'm going to talk to him tomorrow.
I'm going to tell him I finished it.

109
00:18:05.254 --> 00:18:06.680
You don't need to lie.

110
00:18:07.819 --> 00:18:09.450
You won't convince him
one way or the other.

111
00:18:13.329 --> 00:18:14.334
Oh, sweetheart.

112
00:18:16.838 --> 00:18:18.032
I know it's disappointing.

113
00:18:19.633 --> 00:18:21.710
When you start getting older,
there's all this

114
00:18:22.904 --> 00:18:25.477
ridiculous pressure.
God knows I understand.

115
00:18:27.484 --> 00:18:28.594
But it's all right.

116
00:18:29.988 --> 00:18:31.515
No matter what.

117
00:18:33.361 --> 00:18:36.223
You'll probably get to dance
the part of the cat again.

118
00:18:37.541 --> 00:18:39.605
That's such a wonderful part.

119
00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.350
Or maybe he'll make you a big swan.

120
00:18:42.385 --> 00:18:46.318
Either way, you'll shine.

121
00:18:48.512 --> 00:18:48.988
You know...

122
00:18:50.467 --> 00:18:51.803
Everything will be better
in the morning.

123
00:18:54.579 --> 00:18:56.097
It always is.

124
00:18:59.487 --> 00:19:00.508
Sweet girl.

125
00:19:26.778 --> 00:19:27.468
Yes, Nina?

126
00:19:27.503 --> 00:19:28.783
Do you have a minute?

127
00:19:32.693 --> 00:19:34.783
- Now's not a good time. I get it.
- Now is perfect.

128
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:38.715
So...

129
00:19:41.763 --> 00:19:43.714
I just wanted to tell you that

130
00:19:43.749 --> 00:19:46.637
I practiced the coda last night and

131
00:19:46.672 --> 00:19:48.520
I finished.

132
00:19:53.665 --> 00:19:54.848
I thought you should know.

133
00:19:54.883 --> 00:19:58.693
Okay, Nina, listen. Honestly,
I don't care about your technique.

134
00:19:58.728 --> 00:20:01.679
- You should know that by now.
- Yeah, but yesterday...

135
00:20:01.714 --> 00:20:02.849
No.
Anyway...

136
00:20:02.884 --> 00:20:05.297
I've already chosen Veronica.
Sorry.

137
00:20:05.332 --> 00:20:08.066
Sorry.

138
00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:10.148
Okay, thank you.

139
00:20:13.525 --> 00:20:14.053
That's it?

140
00:20:14.088 --> 00:20:16.574
You're not going to
try and change my mind?

141
00:20:18.569 --> 00:20:19.976
You must have thought
it was possible.

142
00:20:20.011 --> 00:20:23.270
Otherwise, what are you
doing here all dolled up?

143
00:20:25.826 --> 00:20:27.470
I came to ask for the part.

144
00:20:32.519 --> 00:20:32.938
Well...

145
00:20:32.973 --> 00:20:35.905
The truth is...

146
00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:39.842
When I look at you,
all I see is the White Swan.

147
00:20:39.877 --> 00:20:44.081
Yes, you're beautiful,
fearful, fragile.

148
00:20:44.782 --> 00:20:45.899
Ideal casting.

149
00:20:48.127 --> 00:20:51.258
But the Black Swan?
It's a hard fucking job to dance both.

150
00:20:52.382 --> 00:20:53.952
I can dance the Black Swan, too.

151
00:20:53.987 --> 00:20:55.090
Really?

152
00:20:55.125 --> 00:20:58.181
In four years,
every time you dance,

153
00:20:58.216 --> 00:21:03.064
I see obsess getting each and every move
perfectly right, but I never see you lose yourself.

154
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.186
Ever.
All that discipline for what?

155
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:12.623
- I just want to be perfect.
- You what?

156
00:21:14.309 --> 00:21:15.439
I want to be perfect.

157
00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.591
Perfection is not just about control.

158
00:21:22.097 --> 00:21:24.216
It's also about letting go.

159
00:21:24.251 --> 00:21:28.881
Surprise yourself so you can
surprise the audience. Transcendence.

160
00:21:28.916 --> 00:21:31.128
And very few have it in them.

161
00:21:31.163 --> 00:21:33.744
I think I do have it in me.

162
00:21:41.977 --> 00:21:42.582
You bit me?

163
00:21:42.617 --> 00:21:45.684
I can't believe you bit me!

164
00:21:45.719 --> 00:21:47.290
I'm sorry.

165
00:21:47.325 --> 00:21:49.501
Man, that fucking hurt!

166
00:22:06.482 --> 00:22:07.115
What?

167
00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:09.324
Why's she always staring at me?

168
00:22:11.889 --> 00:22:13.685
Hey, it's been posted.

169
00:22:14.836 --> 00:22:16.279
Hey, it's up!

170
00:22:21.682 --> 00:22:23.031
Veronica.

171
00:22:25.218 --> 00:22:26.070
Congratulations.

172
00:22:41.423 --> 00:22:42.539
Hey!

173
00:22:43.899 --> 00:22:44.771
Why would you say that?

174
00:22:46.484 --> 00:22:47.976
Your idea of some sick joke?

175
00:22:48.011 --> 00:22:49.376
What?

176
00:22:51.031 --> 00:22:51.843
Fuck you.

177
00:23:06.167 --> 00:23:06.811
Hey, Nina!

178
00:23:06.846 --> 00:23:08.279
Congratulations!

179
00:23:14.767 --> 00:23:16.051
Congratulations.

180
00:23:16.059 --> 00:23:17.515
You're so beautiful.

181
00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:20.501
Congratulations.

182
00:23:37.756 --> 00:23:39.052
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi.

183
00:23:39.087 --> 00:23:41.030
<i>What is it?
What's wrong?</i>

184
00:23:41.065 --> 00:23:42.636
I'm fine.

185
00:23:44.784 --> 00:23:46.177
He picked me, Mom.

186
00:23:49.553 --> 00:23:50.510
Do you hear me?

187
00:23:50.545 --> 00:23:53.398
<i>- For Swan Lake?</i>
- I'm going to be Swan Queen!

188
00:23:55.613 --> 00:23:56.859
Mom!

189
00:23:56.894 --> 00:23:59.326
I'll be home soon.
I just wanted to let you know.

190
00:24:00.383 --> 00:24:01.428
<i>- I love you.</i>
- I love you, too.

191
00:24:36.629 --> 00:24:37.292
Mom?

192
00:24:40.977 --> 00:24:42.030
Mom, are you in your room?

193
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:16.661
Nina?

194
00:25:16.696 --> 00:25:18.132
Are you home?

195
00:25:30.898 --> 00:25:32.424
Nina, when you get out
I'm in the kitchen.

196
00:25:34.851 --> 00:25:35.868
Come on, sweetie.

197
00:25:40.165 --> 00:25:42.600
My daughter, the Swan Queen.

198
00:25:47.558 --> 00:25:50.575
It's our favorite.
Vanilla with strawberry filling.

199
00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:52.169
Oh, Mom, not too big.

200
00:25:52.204 --> 00:25:54.144
Oh, that's way, way too much.

201
00:25:54.179 --> 00:25:56.266
- It's a celebration. It's just this once.
- Mom...

202
00:25:57.347 --> 00:25:58.766
My stomach's still in knots.

203
00:26:01.497 --> 00:26:02.241
Fine.

204
00:26:02.276 --> 00:26:04.102
Fine.

205
00:26:04.137 --> 00:26:05.385
Then it's garbage!

206
00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.637
No, Mom, don't.
I'm sorry.

207
00:26:14.989 --> 00:26:19.109
I'm just...
I'm just so proud of you.

208
00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:21.879
It looks so yummy.

209
00:27:34.162 --> 00:27:35.257
Okay, okay.

210
00:27:35.292 --> 00:27:36.762
Thank you.
Thank you.

211
00:27:36.797 --> 00:27:38.848
Thank you, Nina.

212
00:27:38.883 --> 00:27:40.634
That's very nice.

213
00:27:42.023 --> 00:27:42.817
Very nice.

214
00:27:44.462 --> 00:27:47.624
But I knew the White Swan
wouldn't be a problem.

215
00:27:47.659 --> 00:27:51.354
The real work will your
metamorphosis into her evil twin.

216
00:27:53.314 --> 00:27:55.130
And I know I saw
a flash of her yesterday.

217
00:27:56.687 --> 00:27:58.440
So get ready to give me
more of that bite.

218
00:28:20.949 --> 00:28:21.762
Excellent.

219
00:28:22.666 --> 00:28:27.788
That evil force is pulling you that you
can't escape. That's just out of your control.

220
00:28:28.771 --> 00:28:33.444
So you sense it, you get aware of it more:
"It's taking me, it's taking me."

221
00:28:33.479 --> 00:28:36.144
A little bit more desperate.

222
00:28:36.902 --> 00:28:40.921
Right, and you can maybe go up a little bit
and then come down, and then...

223
00:28:40.956 --> 00:28:42.219
That's it.

224
00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:18.569
Watch the way she moves.

225
00:29:20.128 --> 00:29:23.909
Imprecise,
but effortless.

226
00:29:26.265 --> 00:29:27.414
She's not faking it.

227
00:29:27.449 --> 00:29:36.535
Gorgeous!
Okay, that's beautiful.

228
00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:38.415
Let's start again from the beginning.

229
00:29:47.658 --> 00:29:50.333
You'll room with Beth from now on,
so be considerate.

230
00:29:50.368 --> 00:29:51.702
Thanks, Susie.

231
00:29:52.587 --> 00:29:54.156
Those are for you, from Mr. Leroy.

232
00:29:54.191 --> 00:29:56.136
They're beautiful.

233
00:30:14.423 --> 00:30:15.439
I'll be back in a second.

234
00:30:19.031 --> 00:30:19.795
Let me come back to you, please.

235
00:30:23.678 --> 00:30:24.144
Let's go.

236
00:30:30.064 --> 00:30:31.397
Ready to be thrown to the wolves?

237
00:30:31.432 --> 00:30:35.058
We need our cash,
so please don't forget to smile.

238
00:30:35.093 --> 00:30:39.416
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
may I have your attention?

239
00:30:41.412 --> 00:30:41.969
Good evening.

240
00:30:42.004 --> 00:30:44.849
Let me make this
very important announcement.

241
00:30:44.884 --> 00:30:51.114
You all had had the chance and
the privilege to be enchanted, transported,

242
00:30:51.115 --> 00:30:53.914
and even sometimes devastated,
by the performances

243
00:30:53.927 --> 00:30:55.948
of this true artist of our company.

244
00:30:55.956 --> 00:30:58.968
She's been a crucial
inspiration to my work.

245
00:30:59.003 --> 00:31:02.786
A role model to all dancers,
and even more than that,

246
00:31:02.821 --> 00:31:05.808
a deeply appreciated
presence on our stage.

247
00:31:05.843 --> 00:31:07.935
You all know who I am talking about.

248
00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:11.278
Ladies and gentlemen, Beth Macintyre.

249
00:31:16.735 --> 00:31:17.723
But as we all know,

250
00:31:17.758 --> 00:31:20.137
every great career
has to come to an end.

251
00:31:20.172 --> 00:31:25.026
Beth is retiring at the end of season.

252
00:31:26.551 --> 00:31:29.363
She will be giving her
farewell performance as Melpomene,

253
00:31:29.398 --> 00:31:31.921
the role she originated
in my first ballet.

254
00:31:34.509 --> 00:31:35.977
My little princess,

255
00:31:36.012 --> 00:31:39.281
we honor you.
You will be greatly missed,

256
00:31:40.034 --> 00:31:42.373
and never forgotten.

257
00:31:42.408 --> 00:31:46.470
But as we bid <i>adieu</i> to one star,
we welcome another.

258
00:31:47.502 --> 00:31:50.492
We're opening our season
with my new version of <i>Swan Lake</i>.

259
00:31:50.527 --> 00:31:55.500
Taking the role of our new Swan Queen,
the exquisite Nina Sayers.

260
00:32:01.164 --> 00:32:03.875
You'll soon have the pleasure
of seeing her perform,

261
00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:11.369
but right now, let's please raise a glass:
To all of us. To Beth. To Nina.

262
00:32:13.746 --> 00:32:14.487
To beauty.

263
00:32:32.471 --> 00:32:33.324
Just a second.

264
00:32:42.627 --> 00:32:43.525
Just a second!

265
00:33:05.151 --> 00:33:06.675
Come on!
I'm about to burst!

266
00:33:13.549 --> 00:33:14.993
Hey, it's you!

267
00:33:15.028 --> 00:33:17.604
I don't think we ever
officially met.

268
00:33:17.639 --> 00:33:20.291
- I'm Lily.
- Hi, I'm Nina.

269
00:33:20.326 --> 00:33:22.511
Yes, our new Swan Queen.

270
00:33:22.546 --> 00:33:24.109
- Here, hold this.
- Yeah, sure.

271
00:33:25.548 --> 00:33:29.219
You must be so excited.

272
00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:32.668
Are you freaking out?

273
00:33:32.703 --> 00:33:33.740
- Yeah...
- Yeah?

274
00:33:35.981 --> 00:33:36.814
Oh, it's okay.

275
00:33:36.849 --> 00:33:38.681
Oh, I'd be losing my mind.

276
00:33:38.716 --> 00:33:40.940
I should get back...

277
00:33:40.975 --> 00:33:42.679
No, no, no, come on, stay.

278
00:33:42.714 --> 00:33:44.505
Keep me company.

279
00:33:48.214 --> 00:33:49.003
Excuse me.

280
00:33:51.595 --> 00:33:52.390
Oh, there you are.
Come on.

281
00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:01.074
Hey. They tried to eat you alive,
but here you are.

282
00:34:02.662 --> 00:34:03.386
You did well.

283
00:34:03.421 --> 00:34:04.790
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

284
00:34:06.077 --> 00:34:06.879
Where are you going?

285
00:34:06.914 --> 00:34:09.233
Upper west side.

286
00:34:09.268 --> 00:34:11.041
Stop at my place for a drink.
It's on the way.

287
00:34:11.076 --> 00:34:14.838
Thomas, you need to say hello
to Karen Holloway.

288
00:34:17.211 --> 00:34:19.280
A minute more of ass-kissing.
I'll be back. Wait for me here, all right?

289
00:34:22.231 --> 00:34:23.315
Hello, Karen!

290
00:35:05.668 --> 00:35:06.489
Beth!

291
00:35:08.614 --> 00:35:10.420
I'm so sorry to hear
you're leaving the company.

292
00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.279
What did you do to get this role?

293
00:35:17.622 --> 00:35:20.314
He always said you were
such a frigid little girl.

294
00:35:21.049 --> 00:35:24.464
What did you do to make
him change his mind?

295
00:35:24.499 --> 00:35:28.623
Did you suck his cock?

296
00:35:28.639 --> 00:35:30.389
Not all of us have to.

297
00:35:33.195 --> 00:35:34.567
You fucking whore!

298
00:35:34.602 --> 00:35:37.969
You're a fucking little whore!

299
00:35:38.004 --> 00:35:39.415
Whoa, what's going on here?

300
00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:42.580
Hey, I need to talk to you.

301
00:35:42.615 --> 00:35:44.748
- You're drunk. You should go home.
- I need to talk to you.

302
00:35:44.783 --> 00:35:48.466
No! Don't you do that!
Don't you dismiss me like that!

303
00:35:50.988 --> 00:35:53.648
My little princess, please.
Pull it together.

304
00:35:55.456 --> 00:35:57.057
- Come.
- I'm coming by later.

305
00:35:57.092 --> 00:36:01.768
I have something for you.
It's a token of my appreciation.

306
00:36:01.803 --> 00:36:04.530
- Right.
- You make the most of it, Nina.

307
00:36:05.773 --> 00:36:07.092
Don't worry. It's typical.

308
00:36:13.036 --> 00:36:15.893
Please. I thought it'd be good
to talk about the role.

309
00:36:15.928 --> 00:36:17.234
Drown this a little.

310
00:36:17.269 --> 00:36:19.518
I don't want there to be
any boundaries between us.

311
00:36:19.553 --> 00:36:21.601
- No, me neither.
- Good.

312
00:36:21.636 --> 00:36:26.003
So...
You got a boyfriend?

313
00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:28.245
No.

314
00:36:30.175 --> 00:36:32.127
Have you had many in the past?

315
00:36:33.492 --> 00:36:34.198
A few.

316
00:36:34.233 --> 00:36:35.883
But no one serious.

317
00:36:40.743 --> 00:36:41.744
You're not a virgin are you?

318
00:36:45.281 --> 00:36:45.946
No.

319
00:36:45.981 --> 00:36:48.193
So there's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

320
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.439
And you enjoy making love?

321
00:36:57.292 --> 00:36:57.793
Excuse me?

322
00:36:57.828 --> 00:36:59.979
Come on, sex.

323
00:37:00.014 --> 00:37:01.411
Do you enjoy it?

324
00:37:04.406 --> 00:37:06.268
We need to be able
to talk about this.

325
00:37:14.316 --> 00:37:16.071
I've got a little homework
assignment for you.

326
00:37:16.106 --> 00:37:20.563
Go home and touch yourself.

327
00:37:22.609 --> 00:37:23.677
Live a little.

328
00:37:27.843 --> 00:37:30.539
Well it's late.
Lots of work tomorrow.

329
00:37:30.574 --> 00:37:33.470
The doorman will
find a cab for you.

330
00:37:38.026 --> 00:37:40.845
Sounds like quite an evening.
I wish I could have been there.

331
00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.415
You know I asked.

332
00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:44.221
I know you did.
Susie told me.

333
00:37:44.256 --> 00:37:47.130
Guess he wanted you
all to himself.

334
00:37:47.165 --> 00:37:48.286
But why?

335
00:37:48.321 --> 00:37:50.710
Don't blame him.

336
00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:54.173
Where'd you get these?

337
00:37:54.208 --> 00:37:56.032
They're fake.

338
00:37:57.599 --> 00:37:59.852
Fooled me.

339
00:38:06.306 --> 00:38:07.141
I can do it.

340
00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:14.349
He must have been
by your side all night.

341
00:38:14.384 --> 00:38:17.855
Showing you off.

342
00:38:20.107 --> 00:38:21.845
- Oh, Nina...
- It's just a rash.

343
00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:24.043
Rash?
What are you talking about?

344
00:38:24.078 --> 00:38:25.655
It was worse a few days ago.
It's fine already.

345
00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:27.818
- You've been scratching yourself again.
- No I haven't.

346
00:38:27.853 --> 00:38:29.771
Mom!

347
00:38:29.806 --> 00:38:31.247
This disgusting habit...

348
00:38:32.915 --> 00:38:34.697
Jesus Christ, I thought
you were done with this, Nina.

349
00:38:35.733 --> 00:38:37.440
Shrugs.
You'll keep wearing the shrugs.

350
00:38:37.475 --> 00:38:38.828
Sit down.
You have the white one,

351
00:38:38.863 --> 00:38:40.888
and the pink one.
And that'll hide it.

352
00:38:40.923 --> 00:38:45.625
And then I'll dig out that expensive
coverup. We still have some.

353
00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:48.099
No one will see it.

354
00:38:48.134 --> 00:38:49.741
Mom, please,

355
00:38:49.776 --> 00:38:54.007
It's the role, isn't it?
It's all this pressure.

356
00:38:54.042 --> 00:38:55.914
I knew it'd be too much.
I knew it.

357
00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:00.686
You're all right.

358
00:39:03.474 --> 00:39:04.056
You'll be all right.

359
00:41:07.574 --> 00:41:09.312
Beth's in the hospital.

360
00:41:10.081 --> 00:41:12.371
She had an accident.

361
00:41:12.383 --> 00:41:14.073
Oh no!

362
00:41:14.093 --> 00:41:14.547
Beth?

363
00:41:22.456 --> 00:41:23.058
What happened?

364
00:41:25.535 --> 00:41:27.397
She walked into the street
and got hit by a car.

365
00:41:30.005 --> 00:41:30.644
You know what?

366
00:41:30.679 --> 00:41:34.395
I'm almost sure
she did it on purpose.

367
00:41:36.293 --> 00:41:36.918
How do you know?

368
00:41:37.253 --> 00:41:41.937
Because everything Beth does comes
from within, from some dark impulse.

369
00:41:44.063 --> 00:41:45.850
I guess that's what makes her
so thrilling to watch.

370
00:41:47.196 --> 00:41:48.472
So dangerous.

371
00:41:50.181 --> 00:41:51.904
Even perfect at times.

372
00:41:55.373 --> 00:41:57.222
But also so damned destructive.

373
00:41:59.548 --> 00:42:01.356
Was it right after we saw her?

374
00:42:01.391 --> 00:42:05.270
Wait, wait, wait.
This has nothing to do with you.

375
00:42:05.305 --> 00:42:08.416
It's not your problem,
so don't let yourself be distracted.

376
00:42:08.451 --> 00:42:11.643
This is your moment, Nina.

377
00:42:11.878 --> 00:42:14.225
Don't let it go.

378
00:43:44.216 --> 00:43:44.858
What are you doing?

379
00:45:26.748 --> 00:45:27.335
Nina?

380
00:45:29.432 --> 00:45:31.092
Sweetie, are you ready for me?

381
00:45:41.443 --> 00:45:44.668
And...
Come on!

382
00:45:44.703 --> 00:45:47.197
Forget about control, Nina.
I want to see passion.

383
00:45:47.232 --> 00:45:49.027
Come on.

384
00:45:53.054 --> 00:45:55.066
Stiff like a dead corpse.
Let it go.

385
00:45:55.101 --> 00:45:57.363
Let it go.
Let it go.

386
00:45:57.398 --> 00:45:59.807
And again.

387
00:45:59.842 --> 00:46:02.819
Feels like you have your diaphragm

388
00:46:02.854 --> 00:46:05.571
is in a bit of a contraction?

389
00:46:05.606 --> 00:46:06.729
I'm okay.

390
00:46:11.183 --> 00:46:14.428
Breathe in to this hand.
Breathe in to this hand.

391
00:46:14.463 --> 00:46:16.528
Breathe in, all the way.
Good.

392
00:46:16.563 --> 00:46:19.237
And exhale.

393
00:46:22.738 --> 00:46:24.969
Does it feel jammed in the front
every time you <i>plie</i>?

394
00:46:25.004 --> 00:46:26.773
Sometimes, not always.

395
00:46:30.814 --> 00:46:31.725
- One more pull, okay?
- Okay.

396
00:46:37.631 --> 00:46:38.201
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

397
00:46:58.973 --> 00:47:00.885
David,
can I ask you a question?

398
00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:03.132
Honestly,
would you fuck that girl?

399
00:47:06.409 --> 00:47:07.009
No.

400
00:47:07.044 --> 00:47:08.571
No one would.

401
00:47:10.096 --> 00:47:10.757
Nina...

402
00:47:10.792 --> 00:47:13.978
Your dancing is just as frigid...

403
00:47:14.013 --> 00:47:16.396
Fuck!

404
00:47:21.529 --> 00:47:23.359
We're still working here, please.
Lights!

405
00:47:23.394 --> 00:47:24.808
The lights!

406
00:47:26.285 --> 00:47:26.912
Thank you!

407
00:47:26.947 --> 00:47:30.547
Okay, guys, you can go.
Thanks for your patience.

408
00:47:32.303 --> 00:47:33.480
No, no, you stay.
You stay.

409
00:47:36.091 --> 00:47:37.076
Have fun, you two.

410
00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:41.440
Okay.

411
00:47:41.475 --> 00:47:42.750
Come here.

412
00:47:42.785 --> 00:47:43.792
Come, come, come, come.

413
00:47:46.926 --> 00:47:47.823
I'll be the Prince.

414
00:48:08.847 --> 00:48:09.915
Let it go. Let it go.

415
00:48:31.763 --> 00:48:32.607
Feel my touch.

416
00:48:32.642 --> 00:48:33.782
Respond to it.

417
00:48:33.817 --> 00:48:35.070
Come on.

418
00:48:48.237 --> 00:48:50.562
Open your mouth.
Open it. Open up.

419
00:49:17.298 --> 00:49:18.505
That was me seducing you,

420
00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:21.231
when it needs to be
the other way around.

421
00:49:21.266 --> 00:49:22.378
Please...

422
00:49:46.609 --> 00:49:47.279
Who is that?

423
00:49:48.391 --> 00:49:48.844
Hey.

424
00:49:51.572 --> 00:49:52.302
You okay?

425
00:49:54.755 --> 00:49:55.973
You can't smoke in here.

426
00:49:56.008 --> 00:49:59.593
Well, I won't tell if you won't.

427
00:50:03.115 --> 00:50:03.971
So...

428
00:50:04.006 --> 00:50:06.841
The big day's getting closer
and closer, huh?

429
00:50:09.125 --> 00:50:12.386
Well, I can't wait.
I think you're going to be amazing.

430
00:50:14.534 --> 00:50:14.892
Thanks.

431
00:50:30.405 --> 00:50:31.137
So...

432
00:50:31.172 --> 00:50:33.779
Do  you want to talk about it?

433
00:50:36.333 --> 00:50:38.586
It's that hard to.

434
00:50:39.972 --> 00:50:41.878
Leroy playing
a little too rough for you?

435
00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:44.620
Come on, Nina.
He's a prick.

436
00:50:44.655 --> 00:50:46.684
He's brilliant.

437
00:50:46.719 --> 00:50:50.103
Sure, but it's not like
he's all warm and fuzzy.

438
00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:53.045
What you don't know is...

439
00:50:56.164 --> 00:50:58.166
Someone's hot for teacher!

440
00:51:00.559 --> 00:51:02.287
Oh, come on, it's okay.
I don't blame you.

441
00:51:02.322 --> 00:51:03.710
I should go home.

442
00:51:03.745 --> 00:51:06.462
Nina, come on.
I'm just playing around.

443
00:51:06.497 --> 00:51:09.046
Nina!

444
00:52:29.911 --> 00:52:33.175
Sweetie?
What are you doing in there?

445
00:53:01.408 --> 00:53:01.951
Again.

446
00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:36.258
Again.

447
00:53:48.116 --> 00:53:49.831
Do you have any corrections?

448
00:53:54.942 --> 00:53:56.994
Lily told me that
she saw you crying.

449
00:53:58.955 --> 00:54:00.494
That you were very upset

450
00:54:00.529 --> 00:54:02.432
and that I should
take it easy on you.

451
00:54:02.467 --> 00:54:03.985
I didn't tell her that.

452
00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:06.422
Maybe you need a little break.

453
00:54:06.457 --> 00:54:09.327
A day or two. Or maybe a month.
What do you think?

454
00:54:09.362 --> 00:54:10.543
She shouldn't have said anything.

455
00:54:10.578 --> 00:54:12.702
No, you shouldn't be
whining in the first place.

456
00:54:12.737 --> 00:54:13.486
I didn't.

457
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:18.333
You could be brilliant.

458
00:54:18.368 --> 00:54:20.271
But you're a coward.

459
00:54:20.306 --> 00:54:22.608
Sorry.

460
00:54:22.643 --> 00:54:25.105
No, stop saying that!
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

461
00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:26.657
Stop being so fucking weak.

462
00:54:26.692 --> 00:54:28.087
Again!

463
00:54:41.515 --> 00:54:41.946
Lily...

464
00:54:41.981 --> 00:54:45.060
Oh, look who's decided
to grace us with her presence.

465
00:54:45.095 --> 00:54:46.023
I need to talk to you.

466
00:54:46.058 --> 00:54:46.974
Okay.

467
00:54:47.009 --> 00:54:48.468
Now.

468
00:54:49.849 --> 00:54:50.334
Shut up.

469
00:54:50.369 --> 00:54:51.585
Come on.

470
00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:56.163
What's up?

471
00:54:56.198 --> 00:54:58.810
You told Thomas about last night?

472
00:55:00.504 --> 00:55:03.402
Oh, yeah. I ran into him in the morning and
he said you guys were having some trouble.

473
00:55:03.437 --> 00:55:04.527
Why would he talk to you?

474
00:55:04.562 --> 00:55:07.222
Oh, excuse me, your highness.

475
00:55:07.257 --> 00:55:11.112
I just told him you're working your ass off
and I think you'll be great.

476
00:55:11.147 --> 00:55:12.046
Well you shouldn't have.

477
00:55:16.445 --> 00:55:16.921
Okay.

478
00:55:50.072 --> 00:55:51.355
Has he tried anything with you?

479
00:55:55.884 --> 00:55:57.535
He has a reputation.

480
00:56:01.391 --> 00:56:04.704
I have a right to be concerned, Nina.
You've been staying late so many nights.

481
00:56:04.739 --> 00:56:08.863
Rehearsing. I just hope
he isn't taking advantage, that's all.

482
00:56:08.898 --> 00:56:10.303
He's not.

483
00:56:10.338 --> 00:56:11.953
Good.

484
00:56:14.796 --> 00:56:16.609
I just don't want you to make
the same mistake I did.

485
00:56:18.339 --> 00:56:18.735
Thanks.

486
00:56:20.262 --> 00:56:20.942
Not like that.

487
00:56:22.265 --> 00:56:24.305
I just mean as far as
my career was concerned.

488
00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:25.244
What career?

489
00:56:29.262 --> 00:56:30.957
The one I gave up to have you.

490
00:56:33.272 --> 00:56:34.311
I'm twenty-eight.

491
00:56:34.346 --> 00:56:35.737
So?

492
00:56:36.415 --> 00:56:37.601
Only that...

493
00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:40.660
Only what?

494
00:56:40.695 --> 00:56:42.324
Nothing.

495
00:56:42.359 --> 00:56:43.593
- What?
- Nothing.

496
00:56:47.348 --> 00:56:48.321
How is your skin?

497
00:56:48.356 --> 00:56:50.434
Fine.

498
00:56:50.469 --> 00:56:52.115
- Are you leaving it alone?
- Mm-hmm.

499
00:56:55.347 --> 00:56:55.907
Let me see.

500
00:57:01.109 --> 00:57:02.405
- Take off your shirt.
- No.

501
00:57:15.732 --> 00:57:16.100
Can I help you?

502
00:57:20.674 --> 00:57:21.460
Who was that?

503
00:57:21.495 --> 00:57:23.044
It was no one.

504
00:57:25.215 --> 00:57:25.825
It was no one.

505
00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:31.639
Hello?

506
00:57:36.448 --> 00:57:37.157
What are you doing here?

507
00:57:37.192 --> 00:57:39.145
I just came by to apologize.

508
00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:41.379
You're right. I should have never
spoken to him about you.

509
00:57:41.414 --> 00:57:43.592
- Sweetheart.
- Give me a second.

510
00:57:43.627 --> 00:57:45.287
- Your dinner...
- Mom, please.

511
00:57:47.575 --> 00:57:48.851
Oh, she's a trip.

512
00:57:48.867 --> 00:57:50.253
How do you know where I live?

513
00:57:51.696 --> 00:57:52.783
I have my ways.

514
00:57:54.872 --> 00:57:57.201
Jesus, relax.
I got it from Susie in the office.

515
00:57:58.524 --> 00:58:01.779
Look, I feel really shitty about what I did,
and I really want to make it up to you.

516
00:58:01.791 --> 00:58:04.057
So how about I take you out to dinner?

517
00:58:05.102 --> 00:58:07.586
- I don't think...
- Okay, that's
