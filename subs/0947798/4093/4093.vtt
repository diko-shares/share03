00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
@  027 - Sawbuck - Ten dollar bill
@ 101 - Speak - Speak easy
@ 235 - Puss - Face
@ 245 - Chopper - Machine gun
@ 507 - Gabby - Talkative

2
00:00:46,275 --> 00:00:47,606
Times are tough.

3
00:00:47,801 --> 00:00:50,660
So most people are
working hard to get along.

4
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:55,647
Young men are, trying to do well on
their jobs. Thinking of their families.

5
00:00:55,794 --> 00:00:58,155
Of getting ahead
so they can buy a house.

6
00:00:58,318 --> 00:01:01,513
And then a little car
to go driving on Sundays.

7
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,479
Here is another sort of city,
but only of men.

8
00:01:08,716 --> 00:01:10,772
Many of them still in their twenties.

9
00:01:11,179 --> 00:01:13,418
They work because they have to.

10
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:18,669
But society hopes the will continue
to work after their release.

11
00:01:19,605 --> 00:01:22,088
Sometimes society succeeds...

12
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,701
Sometimes it fails tragically.

13
00:01:45,536 --> 00:01:48,894
The prison authorizes and parole board
were confident they had succeeded

14
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:52,950
Lester N Gillis.

15
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:55,330
Soon to be better know as...

16
00:02:06,651 --> 00:02:09,598
Hi Les. Long time, no see.

17
00:02:10,982 --> 00:02:12,317
Get in.

18
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:16,481
- Who told you I was getting out?
- What's the difference.

19
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:19,884
You need a ride into town don't you.
Get in.

20
00:02:20,503 --> 00:02:22,363
Come on. Hop in.

21
00:02:42,556 --> 00:02:45,145
I asked you.
Who told you I was getting out?

22
00:02:45,422 --> 00:02:47,376
The guy who got you out.

23
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:51,255
Guy who got me...
I got myself out by being a good boy.

24
00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:55,325
- Must have took some doing.
- It did, it did.

25
00:02:55,537 --> 00:02:58,305
Who's the joker taking the bows
for getting me parole?

26
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,926
- Rocca.
- Rocca?

27
00:03:01,545 --> 00:03:03,800
Is he still alive?
Why?

28
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:06,340
You can ask him when you see him.

29
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:10,826
I'm only going to see the parole officer
and him because I have to.

30
00:03:11,481 --> 00:03:16,219
That cheap suit and sawbuck
they gave you ain't gonna last long.

31
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:18,210
You're gonna need money.

32
00:03:18,682 --> 00:03:21,857
If I need money,
don't worry about me kid, I'll get it.

33
00:03:22,346 --> 00:03:25,358
The parole officer will
want you to get a job.

34
00:03:25,537 --> 00:03:28,045
- I'll get one.
- You have one.

35
00:03:29,124 --> 00:03:30,670
With Rocca.

36
00:05:08,122 --> 00:05:11,264
Hello shrimp.
I'll be with you in a minute.

37
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,077
Simmer down little man.
You ain't going nowhere.

38
00:05:20,305 --> 00:05:23,741
That's a hundred I owe you Matt.
I'll pay you later.

39
00:05:23,983 --> 00:05:26,670
Well, how does it feel
to be outside for a change?

40
00:05:26,768 --> 00:05:31,115
If I'm not interrupting your game,
Mr. Rocca, maybe I could find out.

41
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:34,526
You ain't talking to a screw now.

42
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:37,506
If it wasn't for me, you'd
still be inside for quite a stretch.

43
00:05:37,632 --> 00:05:41,100
Don't forget that.
I've got a big investment in you.

44
00:05:42,402 --> 00:05:45,024
I've got a big job for you little man.

45
00:05:45,243 --> 00:05:47,653
If it's a big job.
why get a little man?

46
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:51,121
Maybe I don't know
any big men I can trust.

47
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,777
Come on. I'll show you.

48
00:06:09,977 --> 00:06:12,516
You're wound up like a watch.

49
00:06:13,601 --> 00:06:15,500
We've got to do something about that.

50
00:06:18,465 --> 00:06:19,530
Tell me...

51
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:23,169
Do they let you read the newspapers
up there? - Sure.

52
00:06:23,276 --> 00:06:26,197
When they serve breakfast to us in bed.

53
00:06:27,457 --> 00:06:30,777
They sure must have
rousted you around shrimp.

54
00:06:30,972 --> 00:06:35,658
You don't like my size, let me off
and I'll buy a pair of elevator shoes.

55
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:37,558
You talk like you're a kid.

56
00:06:37,771 --> 00:06:40,575
You're OK or you wouldn't be here.

57
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:47,876
Hey, take a look up ahead.

58
00:06:52,354 --> 00:06:54,733
Guys out of work all over the country.

59
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:59,952
Kids going hungry. And those bums beat
them up if they try to make a buck.

60
00:07:00,395 --> 00:07:03,662
Is that where you make your slot
machines or you've got a still in there?

61
00:07:03,821 --> 00:07:06,469
No. I'm branching out.
You've got to.

62
00:07:06,706 --> 00:07:10,433
Soon they'll be selling booze in
delicatessens. Won't need prescriptions.

63
00:07:10,682 --> 00:07:13,771
So I found me a new gravy train.

64
00:07:14,214 --> 00:07:16,220
Somebody's got to be civic minded.

65
00:07:16,451 --> 00:07:19,327
Guys who don't want to work
ain't good citizens.

66
00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:22,201
I ain't a particular good citizen.

67
00:07:22,361 --> 00:07:25,272
Nobody's asking you, kid.

68
00:07:25,591 --> 00:07:29,497
Give the tall guy with no hat
a good look so you won't forget him.

69
00:07:33,065 --> 00:07:36,455
The one with the glasses.
That's Steve Guarari

70
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,420
- He's an organizer.
- So?

71
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:42,650
So you start him organizing.

72
00:07:43,023 --> 00:07:45,349
Guys in that racket don't listen good.

73
00:07:45,721 --> 00:07:47,940
They've been worked on by cops, I hear.

74
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:50,454
Cops don't talk loud enough.

75
00:07:51,341 --> 00:07:54,856
- We must have met different cops.
- I guess so.

76
00:07:55,246 --> 00:07:58,051
The ones I know are on my payroll.

77
00:08:04,683 --> 00:08:07,186
How loud do I have to talk?

78
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:11,535
One or two words ought to do it.
And for saying them, you get a grand.

79
00:08:12,121 --> 00:08:13,727
He lives there.

80
00:08:18,283 --> 00:08:20,467
Comes home about six for dinner.

81
00:08:20,609 --> 00:08:23,325
About 7:30 goes down to union HQ.

82
00:08:23,893 --> 00:08:26,005
Bunch of his boys
hanging around there so...

83
00:08:26,094 --> 00:08:27,780
this is the best place.

84
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:29,769
Here.

85
00:08:37,555 --> 00:08:39,206
You're not my man?

86
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:43,750
I don't knock off any poor slob
whose been slapped around by the cops.

87
00:08:44,087 --> 00:08:47,389
- That's a funny reason.
- I'm a funny guy.

88
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:53,389
Maybe I should have left you in the can.
I could put you back again.

89
00:08:53,644 --> 00:08:56,147
But... I ain't going to.
You know why?

90
00:08:56,377 --> 00:08:58,738
Because you're a funny guy
with funny reasons.

91
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,028
I find something else for you to do.

92
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:03,105
I know some cops need talking to.

93
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,942
It's kind of rich for my blood ain't it?

94
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:18,297
Say my name in this hotel,
they'll give you a ring.

95
00:09:19,007 --> 00:09:20,960
Gerry'll be in touch with you.

96
00:09:21,652 --> 00:09:23,782
Keep your nose clean.

97
00:10:38,368 --> 00:10:40,161
Solly.

98
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,443
See nobody gets their fingers
caught in the cash register.

99
00:11:10,597 --> 00:11:12,923
Sue... is this guy OK?

100
00:11:13,065 --> 00:11:15,656
Reach back and buzz that buzzer.

101
00:11:20,884 --> 00:11:22,552
There's a fellow ask... oops.

102
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,765
No wonder you weren't hearing good.

103
00:11:28,686 --> 00:11:30,710
OK.

104
00:11:32,538 --> 00:11:34,313
Go on in Jim.

105
00:11:36,915 --> 00:11:38,655
Haven't they
knocked over that speak yet?

106
00:11:38,797 --> 00:11:40,696
Every couple of weeks.

107
00:11:41,318 --> 00:11:43,608
Hey, this is no good.
Let's get out of here.

108
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:46,306
I'm the only one around tonight
who can pass them through.

109
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,182
- I'll be off in... three hours.
- Three?

110
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,460
You know how long three hours is to me?

111
00:11:53,886 --> 00:11:55,874
Longer than it is to me.

112
00:11:57,367 --> 00:12:00,314
- Your place?
- I've got a room mate.

113
00:12:01,202 --> 00:12:02,782
Ophelia.

114
00:12:03,758 --> 00:12:07,095
306, The Stirling.
Don't bother to knock.

115
00:12:07,788 --> 00:12:09,687
I won't be asleep.

116
00:12:22,052 --> 00:12:24,182
Somebody did the job.

117
00:12:24,804 --> 00:12:26,632
Skip it.

118
00:12:30,175 --> 00:12:32,109
Three hours.

119
00:13:08,318 --> 00:13:11,336
I thought I told you not to knock.

120
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,443
- Get out of bed.
- Wait men.

121
00:13:14,638 --> 00:13:17,780
- He's clean.
- What d'you mean I'm clean?

122
00:13:19,095 --> 00:13:21,758
Hey come on.
What are you guys after here?

123
00:13:22,255 --> 00:13:24,616
What are you doing?

124
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,580
Put that rod away will you.

125
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:33,117
If you tell me what you're looking
for pal, I can help you.

126
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:35,727
What ya looking for?

127
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,525
You got a lot of nerve. Look I...
I gotta sleep in this room pal.

128
00:13:39,632 --> 00:13:42,756
You're going to have a nice long sleep.

129
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,445
You know it ain't right for you coppers
to come in here like this...

130
00:13:54,623 --> 00:13:56,469
Tear a guy's room up.

131
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:00,214
It ain't right I tell you.
You don't come into a...

132
00:14:13,355 --> 00:14:16,834
You've been around enough to know
a better place to hide a gun...

133
00:14:17,012 --> 00:14:19,816
I'm not going to be
a patsy for a thing like that.

134
00:14:19,976 --> 00:14:23,242
- I suppose you never saw it before.
- I never saw...

135
00:14:23,456 --> 00:14:27,112
While you're here, why don't
you two dirty bums take a bath.

136
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:39,939
When I left the hotel, before I saw you

137
00:14:40,081 --> 00:14:42,442
I went for a walk in the park.

138
00:14:42,743 --> 00:14:44,962
Sitting there watching the pigeons
when they shot the guy.

139
00:14:45,193 --> 00:14:46,897
Rocca had them plant the gun.

140
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:50,341
I saw no one. No one saw me.
I can't prove it.

141
00:14:50,518 --> 00:14:52,950
I can't prove nothing.
I'm dead.

142
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:57,903
- I going to see Rocca.
- You stay away from him...

143
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:03,003
I don't want him knowing
anything about you, see?

144
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:07,174
Why couldn't they have waited
just one night.

145
00:15:13,268 --> 00:15:16,712
- Go on. Get out.
- I'll come back on Friday.

146
00:15:16,943 --> 00:15:21,487
- I won't be here. I'll see you
next Monday when I come up for trial.

147
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,628
- A month's too long to wait.
- Time's up!

148
00:16:15,258 --> 00:16:16,820
Board!

149
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:12,406
Slow down. We don't want
to get picked up for speeding.

150
00:17:13,443 --> 00:17:16,602
- You're all right honey.
- I've got you some clothes and stuff.

151
00:17:16,815 --> 00:17:18,537
They're in the back with mine.

152
00:17:18,661 --> 00:17:21,963
- Were you seen at the station?
- I don't think so.

153
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,584
- We'll must split up for a couple days.
- No

154
00:17:25,726 --> 00:17:27,217
I've lived without you enough.

155
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,442
- Everyone will be looking for me.
- Then they'll be looking for both of us

156
00:17:32,827 --> 00:17:35,046
Your luck is due for a change.

157
00:17:35,241 --> 00:17:38,046
Fat slob Rocca double-crossed me.
He's gotta die.

158
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,921
- I don't care if I go with him.
- Well I do.

159
00:17:41,071 --> 00:17:44,266
I'm gonna rub this guy.
I'm gonna be moving fast.

160
00:17:44,372 --> 00:17:47,319
I don't care what you do.
I'm staying with you.

161
00:17:47,444 --> 00:17:49,556
Then we're going back to Chicago.

162
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,094
That's the way it has to be.

163
00:18:51,842 --> 00:18:53,848
They were coming up the steps.
And he was laughing.

164
00:18:53,955 --> 00:18:55,481
Real loud.

165
00:18:55,605 --> 00:18:57,043
He's not laughing now.

166
00:18:57,185 --> 00:18:59,972
I put two slugs in his big fat belly.
Him and the other two.

167
00:19:00,363 --> 00:19:03,469
- Baby. easy. - Take them
a month to scrape him off the cement.

168
00:19:03,618 --> 00:19:05,802
Stop it baby. It's all over.

169
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:09,654
Big blue Rocca. All it took
to cut him down to size was this.

170
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,849
the cops will sure be looking
for Lester Gillis now.

171
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:15,910
They won't be looking for Nelson.

172
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:19,300
- What d'you mean?
- You got all of me except my name.

173
00:19:19,442 --> 00:19:21,661
Why don't you take that too.

174
00:19:23,276 --> 00:19:24,874
Nelson?

175
00:19:25,176 --> 00:19:27,342
Yeah, OK.

176
00:19:28,147 --> 00:19:30,898
Any name's better than my old man's.

177
00:19:31,165 --> 00:19:35,354
- I need a drink. Find a drug store.
- Have you got a prescription Mr...

178
00:19:35,496 --> 00:19:37,147
Nelson?

179
00:19:37,413 --> 00:19:41,958
Yeah. I've got a prescription...
Mrs. Nelson.

180
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:16,209
they're selling radios now.
You don't need that.

181
00:20:17,522 --> 00:20:20,078
- Give me a pint of Harpers.
- Got a prescription?

182
00:20:20,433 --> 00:20:23,469
While I'm getting it,
give me the whiskey.

183
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:44,387
This prescription call for two bottles
and everything in the tin box.

184
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:04,781
I'll be right with you.

185
00:21:12,982 --> 00:21:14,562
Don't move.

186
00:21:25,177 --> 00:21:28,390
- I... I've been hit.
- Bad?

187
00:21:28,568 --> 00:21:31,781
I... I think it's just my shoulder.

188
00:21:32,517 --> 00:21:34,505
- I'll get you to a doctor.
- a doctor?

189
00:21:34,683 --> 00:21:38,819
- Are you nuts? I can't go to a doctor.
- The one I know you can.

190
00:21:39,494 --> 00:21:41,996
Take it easy baby. It's a long ride.

191
00:22:00,963 --> 00:22:03,661
Wait here baby.
Lie still. They'll come and get you.

192
00:22:03,803 --> 00:22:05,809
Alright, honey.

193
00:22:21,765 --> 00:22:22,990
Coming.

194
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,233
Coming.

195
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,413
I have to see the doc right away.

196
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:39,288
- Do we know you?
- You ought to.

197
00:22:40,054 --> 00:22:43,320
Oh yeah.
I'll see if he's up.

198
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,684
Patient to see you Dr. Saunders.

199
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,447
- Go on in.
- Thank you.

200
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,793
Doctor Saunders?

201
00:23:15,012 --> 00:23:17,001
Susan, eh, right?

202
00:23:17,214 --> 00:23:19,823
I never forget the free ones.

203
00:23:20,214 --> 00:23:21,989
There's a man in the car, he's...

204
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,208
- He's hurt.
- Do I know him?

205
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:28,503
- He's my husband.
- Don't remember you being married.

206
00:23:28,645 --> 00:23:31,628
He's bleeding badly.
Won't you hurry?

207
00:23:36,013 --> 00:23:38,764
Don't you worry your pretty little head.

208
00:23:39,865 --> 00:23:42,279
The doctor'll take care of him.

209
00:23:48,656 --> 00:23:51,283
Our Martha will take the deposit.

210
00:24:00,734 --> 00:24:03,042
Give me a cigarette will you.

211
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,397
What you trying to do, kill him?

212
00:24:28,945 --> 00:24:31,892
You two must have just got married.

213
00:24:32,141 --> 00:24:35,886
A sick man's lucky to have
a tonic like that around.

214
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:38,301
When do we get out of here?

215
00:24:38,425 --> 00:24:41,159
- Any particular hurry?
- You don't come cheap.

216
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:44,407
- Neither does this room.
- Let's see.

217
00:24:45,774 --> 00:24:48,135
Well, you could
get out of here tomorrow.

218
00:24:48,295 --> 00:24:50,212
But I wouldn't advise it.

219
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:52,715
And this isn't a medicine man speaking.

220
00:24:53,407 --> 00:24:55,903
You're lucky it was only a.22.

221
00:24:56,826 --> 00:24:59,755
They leave a nice, clean, small hole.

222
00:25:12,379 --> 00:25:16,622
If he puts his hands on you again,
he's going to be a patient here himself.

223
00:25:19,081 --> 00:25:20,767
Come here Sue.

224
00:25:21,477 --> 00:25:26,090
- You heard what the doctor said.
- That I could get out of here tomorrow.

225
00:25:38,868 --> 00:25:40,856
I'm good for you baby.

226
00:25:42,276 --> 00:25:45,063
Honey you're
just what the doctor ordered.

227
00:25:58,064 --> 00:26:02,253
I was camping and
the gasoline stove blew up in my face.

228
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,898
Did I ask you?

229
00:26:05,307 --> 00:26:07,632
I was saving you the trouble.

230
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:10,472
My husband didn't know
his rabbit gun was loaded.

231
00:26:10,774 --> 00:26:12,088
Yeah.

232
00:26:13,046 --> 00:26:15,886
Here's something for you to read pal.

233
00:26:22,171 --> 00:26:25,239
They've got you going
in the wrong direction.

234
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:27,990
Even got the wrong name.

235
00:26:29,144 --> 00:26:30,280
Hey.

236
00:26:30,777 --> 00:26:32,339
That fellow there...

237
00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:35,961
I wonder what puss
is under those bandages.

238
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,961
Whoever it is,
he won't be doing any talking.

239
00:26:39,351 --> 00:26:42,334
- Hey, did you notice his fingers?
- Yeah.

240
00:26:42,653 --> 00:26:46,345
Go get the doc and find out who he is.
And don't let him touch you.

241
00:26:46,629 --> 00:26:50,020
I don't want him near you.
I don't want his fingerprints on you.

242
00:27:18,216 --> 00:27:20,932
You boys wait here.
Come on buddy.

243
00:27:29,684 --> 00:27:31,388
Well boys...

244
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,346
- Who's the baby face?
- The one I wrote you about.

245
00:27:35,506 --> 00:27:38,599
- His name's Gillis.
- The name is Nelson.

246
00:27:41,581 --> 00:27:44,422
- Dillinger.
- I heard about you.

247
00:27:45,185 --> 00:27:49,055
- Still carrying around that wooden gun?
- No I traded that in for a chopper.

248
00:27:49,658 --> 00:27:53,244
- Know how to use one.
- Just pull the trigger and hang on.

249
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:55,268
You better know
what you're talking about.

250
00:27:55,463 --> 00:27:57,593
What's the job in line Bessell?

251
00:28:03,935 --> 00:28:05,870
Now pay day's Friday.

252
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:10,698
The paymaster's office is right here.
The money wagon pulls in exactly 11:55.

253
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,976
It better be. The men will be swarming
all over the joint for lunch at noon.

254
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:16,858
Was I ever wrong yet, Johnny?

255
00:28:16,982 --> 00:28:19,698
You better not be wrong about
what's in that money wagon either.

256
00:28:19,804 --> 00:28:23,372
Been around $70,000
every week for the last six months.

257
00:28:23,461 --> 00:28:26,514
Does the armored car back up to the
paymasters office, or park alongside?

258
00:28:26,657 --> 00:28:29,106
- It pulls alongside.
- How do we get in the joint?

259
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:31,616
There's a fence and a gate
and guards at the gate.

260
00:28:31,741 --> 00:28:34,146
- Just asking a question.
- OK Baby Face, you got your answer.

261
00:28:34,234 --> 00:28:35,601
My name is Nelson.

262
00:28:35,921 --> 00:28:37,572
I like nicknames.

263
00:28:39,152 --> 00:28:41,264
What outfits service the joint,
you know, milk

264
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:43,331
bottled water, ice.
Ones that use closed trucks.

265
00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:45,053
Or did you forget to find out.

266
00:28:45,212 --> 00:28:47,946
How many jobs have I sold you Johnny?

267
00:28:49,153 --> 00:28:52,366
The ones with the check mark only come
when called, the others every day.

268
00:28:52,473 --> 00:28:54,479
I want to come every day Ralph.

269
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:57,159
Any of you jokers ever learnt a trade?

270
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:58,792
I can put a washer on a faucet.

271
00:28:58,899 --> 00:29:01,810
- Or unplug a stopped up can.
- That's good enough.

272
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,869
Pick yourself a beat up paneled truck.

273
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:06,372
Fix it like it comes from
Ace Plumbing Company.

274
00:29:07,047 --> 00:29:08,769
Put some tools in it.

275
00:29:08,946 --> 00:29:12,514
We ain't the kind of plumbers
that go home to get them.

276
00:29:12,745 --> 00:29:14,485
See you. Come on.

277
00:29:20,961 --> 00:29:23,340
So that's the big man, huh?

278
00:29:23,766 --> 00:29:26,908
Number one on the G list
big enough for ya?

279
00:29:27,334 --> 00:29:28,808
Yes.

280
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:31,399
That's big enough.

281
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:58,162
Somebody dropped their watch
down the drain or something.

282
00:29:58,606 --> 00:30:01,251
- Be kind enough to open the gate.
- Is Joe sick?

283
00:30:01,446 --> 00:30:04,145
Yeah, hangover.
Got to stop making his own.

284
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:06,577
Does it take two of you to fix a drain?

285
00:30:06,932 --> 00:30:09,949
Ever try running a snake though
all by yourself pal?

286
00:30:10,216 --> 00:30:12,932
Let me look at your work order.

287
00:30:24,047 --> 00:30:28,751
Alright. Go ahead.
Tell Joe to lay off the cleaner fluid.

288
00:30:35,728 --> 00:30:37,894
Park it over there by the fire hydrant.

289
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:57,620
- About that time,
- Yeah.

290
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,870
- Sure you know how to use that thing?
- Are you kidding?

291
00:31:23,154 --> 00:31:26,038
How come you didn't use
a chopper on Rocca and his boys?

292
00:31:26,162 --> 00:31:27,884
Who's Rocco?

293
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:32,321
If you didn't know,
you wouldn't be sitting along side me.

294
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,920
Truck's late.

295
00:32:21,328 --> 00:32:23,955
Tell me something I don't know.

296
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:12,263
What's the matter with you?

297
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,625
Give us a hand.

298
00:34:39,731 --> 00:34:41,009
Get in there.

299
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:44,080
Come on. Hurry it up.

300
00:35:20,116 --> 00:35:22,264
Captain Moores, Mr. Markey.

301
00:35:22,494 --> 00:35:26,471
Markey's with our F.B.I. in Chicago,
assigned to the Dillinger case.

302
00:35:26,595 --> 00:35:29,400
We followed your man's trail this far
and then lost it.

303
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:31,861
- It was Dillinger?
- We're almost sure.

304
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:35,429
We'll know positively pretty soon.
Fingerprints are all over the truck,

305
00:35:35,696 --> 00:35:38,376
Blood too. Somebody got it bad.

306
00:35:49,294 --> 00:35:52,809
Alas poor Yorrick.
I knew him well.

307
00:35:53,661 --> 00:35:56,147
Hey Doc. Save some of that.

308
00:35:57,551 --> 00:36:01,332
He might as well have kept his own face
for all the good my retread job did him.

309
00:36:01,474 --> 00:36:04,208
He didn't get
much mileage out of it did he?

310
00:36:04,368 --> 00:36:06,374
And here's a pillow for his head.

311
00:36:06,533 --> 00:36:08,681
Are you gentlemen sure
that's deep enough?

312
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,747
D'you want it deeper?

313
00:36:12,256 --> 00:36:14,972
Well, I imagine it will suffice.

314
00:36:20,161 --> 00:36:22,593
Poor John Hamilton.

315
00:36:22,824 --> 00:36:26,854
Unwept, unhonoured and unsung.

316
00:36:28,025 --> 00:36:29,712
But he won't be lonely.

317
00:36:30,102 --> 00:36:34,487
There are many of his ilk hereabouts,
sleeping here in unmarked graves.

318
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:39,295
- The wages of sin. Et tu Brutus.
- Shut up.

319
00:36:54,263 --> 00:36:58,328
- Why don't you cover yourself up.
- Hey, I'm trying to get a tan.

320
00:37:01,062 --> 00:37:02,979
That ain't all you'll get.

321
00:37:16,366 --> 00:37:19,526
The sun is shining.
Take advantage of it.

322
00:37:20,094 --> 00:37:21,461
I sunburn easy.

323
00:37:21,585 --> 00:37:25,295
You need some suntan lotion.
I've got some in my office.

324
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,378
Why not bring me some next time.

325
00:37:27,538 --> 00:37:32,597
Come to the office my dear.
It's all in the way it's applied.

326
00:37:39,205 --> 00:37:43,145
Like he says. If you're not careful,
you'll wind up being your own patient.

327
00:37:43,323 --> 00:37:46,234
That wouldn't be the first time
a woman got me into trouble.

328
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,239
Then I lost my license.

329
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:53,583
I know I should have said no,
but she was so lovely.

330
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:56,228
Just like you my dear.

331
00:37:56,529 --> 00:38:00,772
- We'd better talk about you doll.
- What's so interesting about me?

332
00:38:01,269 --> 00:38:03,293
My ankles aren't trim.

333
00:38:03,577 --> 00:38:06,133
My legs aren't shapely.

334
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,814
My figure ain't interesting.

335
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,370
I was thinking of your practice.

336
00:38:11,619 --> 00:38:14,494
You must meet a lot
of interesting people.

337
00:38:15,151 --> 00:38:17,565
I don't find them so.
Do you?

338
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:22,358
Only one of them.

339
00:38:25,064 --> 00:38:29,661
I'm telling you John, if the doc don't
keep his hands off Sue, he's a dead man.

340
00:38:30,052 --> 00:38:32,697
Lay off him baby face.
We need him in our business.

341
00:38:32,856 --> 00:38:35,910
- Sue ain't our business.
- So you're taking her out of here?

342
00:38:36,029 --> 00:38:37,254
- Am I?
- Yeah tonight.

343
00:38:37,414 --> 00:38:41,301
We'll drive you and the boys to a place.
You'll wait there for me.

344
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,893
Doc says I got to
stay in bed for a while.

345
00:38:44,053 --> 00:38:46,360
- How long is a while?
- What's it to you?

346
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,807
- I don't want to stick around here.
- Count the dough you made.

347
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,825
I was thinking of calling Fatso
and buying a bank job for us.

348
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:56,718
Forget it.
I said forget it!

349
00:38:57,713 --> 00:39:00,127
They're my boys.
You don't give them orders.

350
00:39:00,482 --> 00:39:02,470
You're not cold enough inside.

351
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:05,310
- What's that mean?
- You blow up too easy.

352
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:08,115
Like when that whistle went off,
you shoot up the joint.

353
00:39:08,435 --> 00:39:10,476
If you don't want me around
I can always...

354
00:39:11,311 --> 00:39:14,488
I want you around
as long as you do as you're told.

355
00:39:18,221 --> 00:39:21,452
- You're the number one man John.
- That's right.

356
00:39:22,179 --> 00:39:24,203
I'm the number one man.

357
00:39:47,032 --> 00:39:48,842
Pull the car round the back Miller.

358
00:39:49,162 --> 00:39:51,753
Rest of you guys bring that junk in.

359
00:39:56,762 --> 00:39:58,502
You heard him. Get the stuff out.

360
00:39:58,626 --> 00:40:01,236
When d'you start
taking orders from that punk?

361
00:40:01,378 --> 00:40:03,650
I've seen him use a chopper.

362
00:40:07,002 --> 00:40:08,653
- Are you Bickman?
- Yeah.

363
00:40:09,363 --> 00:40:12,115
- I'm Nelson.
- I don't know you.

364
00:40:12,434 --> 00:40:14,050
You will.

365
00:40:20,844 --> 00:40:23,897
- I thought the big boy was coming.
- He'll be along.

366
00:40:24,305 --> 00:40:26,418
I'll show you to your room.

367
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,472
I'm Ranald Bickman Mrs. Nelson.
If there's anything I can do...

368
00:40:45,685 --> 00:40:48,134
There is.
Get out!

369
00:41:00,381 --> 00:41:02,529
Get me long distance.

370
00:41:05,512 --> 00:41:08,281
Come here and make like Mrs. Nelson.

371
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:13,227
Long distance.

372
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:19,227
Give me the Nagel Blueprint and
Draughting company in Indianapolis.

373
00:41:30,746 --> 00:41:33,924
Nagel Blueprint Draughting.
Nagel speaking.

374
00:41:34,314 --> 00:41:36,107
Hello, Nagel?

375
00:41:36,409 --> 00:41:39,516
This is Nelson.
Nelson.

376
00:41:40,847 --> 00:41:43,598
Remember we went
to school together in Danville.

377
00:41:44,094 --> 00:41:45,443
School?

378
00:41:45,993 --> 00:41:48,762
Oh, yes. Baby Face.

379
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:52,472
Boss told me to call you
and ask if you had a job for him.

380
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:56,518
- Why didn't he call me himself?
- He's not feeling so good Fatso.

381
00:41:56,642 --> 00:41:58,896
He told me to call instead.

382
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,096
Yes I have something
I think might interest him.

383
00:42:03,185 --> 00:42:05,155
Is your office still in the same place?

384
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:07,197
No. No, we moved.

385
00:42:07,605 --> 00:42:09,540
You know a guy by the name of Bickman?

386
00:42:09,914 --> 00:42:12,861
- Yes I know him.
- How long till you get here?

387
00:42:13,003 --> 00:42:15,471
I'll be on my way in a half hour.

388
00:42:23,776 --> 00:42:26,404
Extra here. Hot off the press.
They've finally done it.

389
00:42:26,652 --> 00:42:30,060
Prohibition has been repealed.
Get your extra here!

390
00:42:42,173 --> 00:42:45,244
That's going to make
a lot of people happy.

391
00:42:45,581 --> 00:42:48,599
Yeah, a lot of other people unhappy.

392
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:30,686
Hey, somebody coming up in a car.
Come on.

393
00:43:30,917 --> 00:43:32,834
Hold it, hold it!

394
00:43:37,468 --> 00:43:39,527
- Alright, it's just Fatso.
- What's he coming up here for?

395
00:43:39,652 --> 00:43:42,456
Because I told him to, that's why.

396
00:43:42,811 --> 00:43:46,113
Sue, get upstairs
and keep an eye on things.

397
00:43:51,648 --> 00:43:53,796
So you got the stuff,
right off the boat.

398
00:43:53,884 --> 00:43:56,884
No, right off the shelf. Didn't
you hear. You can buy it anywhere.

399
00:43:57,026 --> 00:43:58,464
Yeah?

400
00:43:59,086 --> 00:44:01,269
Kind of takes
all the fun out of drinking.

401
00:44:01,393 --> 00:44:03,452
And out of making it too.

402
00:44:04,021 --> 00:44:07,198
Put the rest of the stuff on the table.
Stanley...

403
00:44:07,997 --> 00:44:11,281
Take his car and ditch it.
Come along with me.

404
00:44:26,445 --> 00:44:29,463
We won't move till the others arrive.
Wait at the highway then come in on foot

405
00:44:29,551 --> 00:44:31,628
Preston, you and Duncan, come with me.

406
00:44:47,063 --> 00:44:50,525
- Looks real good.
- Not a large bank, but an exclusive one

407
00:44:50,649 --> 00:44:52,726
Patronized by the very best people.

408
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:54,892
Including me.

409
00:44:55,211 --> 00:44:59,294
- What time do we crack it?
- A few minutes after it closes.

410
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:03,590
I suppose we walk up to the door
and knock and they let us in.

411
00:45:03,678 --> 00:45:07,477
In a manner of speaking yes.
I have all the plans worked out.

412
00:45:07,584 --> 00:45:11,028
It's so simple, I'm surprised
no one ever thought of it before.

413
00:45:22,438 --> 00:45:24,781
All I can see is trees.

414
00:45:24,905 --> 00:45:27,230
That's all there is to see.

415
00:45:29,249 --> 00:45:32,107
You can drink this without going blind.

416
00:45:34,272 --> 00:45:37,414
- Where's Baby?
- With Fatso.

417
00:45:39,296 --> 00:45:41,020
Are you afraid of him too?

418
00:45:41,293 --> 00:45:44,613
- I married him.
- You ain't wearing a ring.

419
00:45:51,107 --> 00:45:53,504
How d'you happen
to get mixed up with him?

420
00:45:53,592 --> 00:45:56,326
Mr. Nelson. Don't you want
to live like other people?

421
00:45:56,663 --> 00:45:58,829
I wouldn't know how to act, Mr. Bickman.

422
00:46:00,072 --> 00:46:01,705
Call me Ranald.

423
00:46:03,083 --> 00:46:04,645
Ranald.

424
00:46:04,751 --> 00:46:07,378
- That's a funny name.
- Scottish.

425
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:09,539
But you're not are you?

426
00:46:09,965 --> 00:46:11,775
86 proof.

427
00:46:22,001 --> 00:46:24,859
Are you going along on the next job?

428
00:46:25,268 --> 00:46:26,936
If he wants me to.

429
00:46:27,309 --> 00:46:28,818
You don't want to.

430
00:46:29,961 --> 00:46:33,174
We haven't had much time together
in the past few years.

431
00:46:33,299 --> 00:46:36,547
Ever wonder how much time you'll
have together from here in?

432
00:46:37,524 --> 00:46:39,316
I don't care.

433
00:46:39,831 --> 00:46:41,624
About time you did.

434
00:46:42,463 --> 00:46:44,380
I still don't want him knowing.

435
00:46:45,392 --> 00:46:47,291
I love him.

436
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,345
Don't ask me why,
because I haven't got the answer.

437
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,797
No woman ever has.

438
00:46:56,984 --> 00:47:00,250
- I thought I'd find you here.
- Wait a minute Baby Face.

439
00:47:00,836 --> 00:47:03,001
- Baby we weren't doing anything.
We were just talking.

440
00:47:03,143 --> 00:47:05,202
I know his kind of talk.

441
00:47:11,779 --> 00:47:13,643
There's somebody out there.

442
00:47:16,732 --> 00:47:18,134
They're cops.

443
00:47:23,764 --> 00:47:28,095
Bonner's waiting up the road.
He wants the cars left here. Let's go.

444
00:47:29,861 --> 00:47:32,701
It's the cops.
We're getting out of here.

445
00:47:33,038 --> 00:47:35,470
We're taking nothing but guns.

446
00:47:36,198 --> 00:47:38,843
A road in back
joins the highway, It's rough.

447
00:47:38,967 --> 00:47:41,044
The one out front is rougher.
Move!

448
00:47:55,046 --> 00:47:56,714
Preston, get the car.

449
00:48:12,016 --> 00:48:13,632
Have you gone nuts?

450
00:48:13,827 --> 00:48:16,472
Baby, baby, wait!

451
00:48:18,513 --> 00:48:20,786
Let him commit suicide.
Let's get out of here.

452
00:48:20,839 --> 00:48:23,430
We're not running out on him.

453
00:48:29,566 --> 00:48:32,122
Come on out of there.

454
00:48:33,134 --> 00:48:36,027
We're Federal Agents.
Come on out!

455
00:48:45,458 --> 00:48:47,713
Come on. Hurry it up.

456
00:48:51,149 --> 00:48:52,871
Get those hands up.

457
00:48:53,031 --> 00:48:54,894
- Where are the others?
- What are you talking...

458
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,684
Go!

459
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,300
Was it Dillinger?

460
00:49:28,081 --> 00:49:29,643
I don't know.

461
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:33,261
You're dying Mister.

462
00:49:33,367 --> 00:49:34,574
Was it Dillinger?

463
00:49:37,627 --> 00:49:39,037
No.

464
00:49:39,836 --> 00:49:41,522
Nelson.

465
00:49:42,691 --> 00:49:44,591
Baby Face Nelson.

466
00:50:49,834 --> 00:50:53,065
- Hey, what have we stopped for?
- We've run out of gas.

467
00:50:53,615 --> 00:50:56,704
You stupe.
Why didn't you watch the gauge?

468
00:51:01,962 --> 00:51:04,234
Here comes a car.

469
00:51:13,109 --> 00:51:16,038
Get out and flag them Sue.
Get out.

470
00:51:30,005 --> 00:51:31,798
What's the trouble?

471
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:35,170
- It won't go.
- Maybe you're out of gas.

472
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:37,460
- Did you look?
- No.

473
00:51:43,486 --> 00:51:45,350
We're swapping cars with you Mister.

474
00:51:45,457 --> 00:51:48,031
- Alright Mr. Nelson.
- So you know him huh?

475
00:51:48,187 --> 00:51:49,536
That's bad.

476
00:51:49,642 --> 00:51:51,790
Look, I never saw anything.

477
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:55,092
- Start running.
- Give me a chance, please.

478
00:51:57,506 --> 00:51:59,583
Trigger happy punk.

479
00:52:02,611 --> 00:52:04,759
Have you heard from him?

480
00:52:06,924 --> 00:52:11,007
- I asked you a question, John.
You ask too many questions.

481
00:52:11,274 --> 00:52:14,274
- Why not take me to a movie tonight?
- We've seen them all.

482
00:52:14,336 --> 00:52:17,034
We haven't seen Manhattan Melodrama.

483
00:52:19,981 --> 00:52:21,916
That's why you want to go out/

484
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:25,849
- Showing off that new red dress.
- D'you like it?

485
00:52:27,145 --> 00:52:29,151
I like what's in it.

486
00:52:49,963 --> 00:52:52,004
Is that all you found out?

487
00:52:52,412 --> 00:52:55,324
John didn't
answer questions, Mr. Parker.

488
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:59,643
I'm sorry I can't help you
find this Baby Face.

489
00:52:59,785 --> 00:53:01,507
So am I.

490
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,801
Not a line nor a whorl in the system.

491
00:53:26,156 --> 00:53:28,109
Better hadn't be,
with what I'm paying you.

492
00:53:28,197 --> 00:53:31,215
Don't hear many of my faces complaining.

493
00:53:31,466 --> 00:53:33,206
They're all dead.

494
00:53:33,987 --> 00:53:37,821
While we're about it,
we should do something about your face

495
00:53:38,158 --> 00:53:41,176
- You don't like my face?
- Let me say I...

496
00:53:41,389 --> 00:53:43,217
Find it interesting.

497
00:53:45,339 --> 00:53:47,380
I like it the way it is.

498
00:53:47,451 --> 00:53:51,375
Sweethearts and mothers.
Their loved ones are without blemish.

499
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:52,724
Their mothers.

500
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:57,020
I may say also,
you're a very fortunate young man.

501
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,487
Luscious helpmate.

502
00:53:59,842 --> 00:54:01,244
Top of your profession.

503
00:54:01,369 --> 00:54:04,511
Thanks to Mr. Dillinger's
luscious young woman.

504
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:06,925
Poor Johnny.

505
00:54:07,067 --> 00:54:11,327
Should have taken a leaf out of Homer.
Ulysses lashed himself to the mast.

506
00:54:11,647 --> 00:54:14,203
To resist the siren's song.

507
00:54:16,404 --> 00:54:18,463
Pour me a drink my dear.

508
00:54:18,783 --> 00:54:23,522
These skilled hands of mine are behaving
like aspen leaves for some odd reason.

509
00:54:23,771 --> 00:54:28,244
Give him a good shot Sue.
It'll stop him from being so gabby.

510
00:54:34,659 --> 00:54:37,162
Got an ink pad around Doc?

511
00:54:37,304 --> 00:54:39,434
Desk drawer, my dear.

512
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:44,156
A clean piece of paper.

513
00:54:44,298 --> 00:54:48,129
You aren't by any chance dubious
about the success of the operation?

514
00:54:48,289 --> 00:54:50,277
Drink your gas and shut up.

515
00:55:03,654 --> 00:55:05,625
I think I want to retire.

516
00:55:52,398 --> 00:55:53,800
Honey...

517
00:55:53,907 --> 00:55:56,481
- They're...
- With all the pain I went through

518
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:58,771
And the $5,000 I owe the doc.

519
00:55:58,872 --> 00:56:00,754
Do your testimonial.

520
00:56:00,896 --> 00:56:03,949
To the greatest surgeon in the world.

521
00:56:04,038 --> 00:56:09,097
How's Johnny Dillinger, Hamilton and
Pretty Boy Floyd and the Barker boys.

522
00:56:09,203 --> 00:56:10,570
I'll give you a testimonial Doc.

523
00:56:10,694 --> 00:56:13,925
- Instead, give me another drink.
- Yeah... yeah...

524
00:56:14,174 --> 00:56:18,132
We'll both have a drink, but not here.
Let's have it outside.

525
00:56:18,256 --> 00:56:21,043
Outside on the front porch.

526
00:56:23,617 --> 00:56:25,428
Come on Doc.

527
00:56:36,253 --> 00:56:38,685
Give you a drink.

528
00:56:45,789 --> 00:56:48,469
- Water...
- Just what you need Doc.

529
00:57:38,394 --> 00:57:41,003
- Did you have trouble getting it?
- No.

530
00:57:41,181 --> 00:57:43,133
Then what took you so long?

531
00:57:43,683 --> 00:57:47,003
I stopped by a creek
and sat listening to it for a while.

532
00:57:47,082 --> 00:57:49,053
What you do a thing like that for?

533
00:57:49,585 --> 00:57:53,917
Three more men to live with than
I bargained for. I'm sick of them all.

534
00:57:54,059 --> 00:57:56,153
We need 'em now.

535
00:57:56,384 --> 00:57:58,301
Do we?

536
00:58:07,313 --> 00:58:09,692
Hey what's the idea?

537
00:58:10,189 --> 00:58:13,320
You're getting to be an awful big man.

538
00:58:15,254 --> 00:58:17,473
Look what we got here.

539
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:21,538
Are you alright?

540
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,669
I guess so.

541
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:30,396
I guess it was lucky for me it worked.

542
00:58:30,733 --> 00:58:34,851
I hope it will be lucky for me.
Let's get ready.

543
00:59:07,344 --> 00:59:10,522
- We're closed.
- A registered letter for Mr. Hall.

544
00:59:10,717 --> 00:59:13,344
He'll have to sign for it personal.

545
00:59:16,398 --> 00:59:19,415
- Where do I find him?
- Over there.

546
00:59:20,197 --> 00:59:21,741
Right, everybody...

547
00:59:21,972 --> 00:59:24,866
Hands high. Come on in front.
Don't press those buzzers.

548
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:27,972
- Or I'll rip this joint to pieces.
- Do as he says.

549
00:59:28,167 --> 00:59:29,907
Come on!

550
00:59:32,801 --> 00:59:36,138
Stay away from that buzzer or it'll be
the last move you make buddy.

551
00:59:37,913 --> 00:59:40,540
Get up. Come on over there.
Move!

552
00:59:40,771 --> 00:59:43,203
- How is it back there?
- Just a second.

553
00:59:43,309 --> 00:59:45,333
You've had it, come on.

554
00:59:45,404 --> 00:59:48,705
The boss goes with us.
If I hear an alarm he's dead.

555
01:00:07,561 --> 01:00:11,306
How come a little guy like you
ever become a bank manager?

556
01:00:12,305 --> 01:00:14,347
I studied and...

557
01:00:14,542 --> 01:00:16,867
- worked hard.
- Size didn't make any difference?

558
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:20,329
- Well I suppose...
- Ever try wearing lifts?

559
01:00:22,897 --> 01:00:24,672
I do wear them.

560
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:28,719
You sure are little

561
01:00:29,979 --> 01:00:31,932
Alright Harvey.

562
01:00:32,163 --> 01:00:34,222
This place is alright.

563
01:00:37,772 --> 01:00:39,530
Get out.

564
01:00:55,687 --> 01:01:00,036
Go on. Hitch yourself a ride home.
Come on. Let's get out of here.

565
01:01:09,982 --> 01:01:11,829
- Baby.
- Hiya Honey.

566
01:01:11,971 --> 01:01:14,704
- We're getting out of here tomorrow.
- The whole family?

567
01:01:14,811 --> 01:01:16,941
Get the boys a drink.

568
01:01:17,189 --> 01:01:20,314
Fatso sure picks them sweet.

569
01:01:22,923 --> 01:01:26,047
Get yourself a drink Van,
you deserve it.

570
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:51,609
Hey what is this? We do all the work
and he does all the counting.

571
01:01:58,333 --> 01:02:01,103
Take away that vest and what is he?

572
01:02:01,333 --> 01:02:03,623
I don't need any vest!

573
01:02:04,884 --> 01:02:06,872
From now on, you're going to wear it.

574
01:02:07,031 --> 01:02:08,629
You know why?

575
01:02:08,984 --> 01:02:10,777
Because you're yellow.

576
01:02:14,985 --> 01:02:17,932
Are you sure that's the man Mr. Hall?

577
01:02:20,363 --> 01:02:22,032
That's the man.

578
01:02:22,139 --> 01:02:24,819
You know, you're lucky to be alive.

579
01:02:24,961 --> 01:02:28,653
I know. I keep pinching myself
to make sure I am.

580
01:02:29,604 --> 01:02:34,468
I'll never forget the look on his face
when I was standing along side the car.

581
01:02:34,823 --> 01:02:36,722
He had death in his eyes.

582
01:02:37,273 --> 01:02:38,906
And then suddenly...

583
01:02:39,137 --> 01:02:41,160
That look disappeared.

584
01:02:42,492 --> 01:02:47,160
You know... I think it's just because
I was a small as he is.

585
01:02:47,498 --> 01:02:50,114
You recognize this man, Mr. Hall?

586
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:54,693
Er... I can't be sure.

587
01:02:54,889 --> 01:02:57,534
Just a minute... Alex.

588
01:02:57,693 --> 01:02:59,876
Once he sees a face... that's it.

589
01:03:00,054 --> 01:03:04,278
- Yes Mr. Hall.
- Alex, can you recognize this man?

590
01:03:06,391 --> 01:03:09,125
I've seen him twice. Weeks ago.

591
01:03:09,462 --> 01:03:13,758
Card he gave me said he was
a deputy county assessor.

592
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:17,983
Mason. That was the name.

593
01:03:18,825 --> 01:03:20,317
No!

594
01:03:20,494 --> 01:03:22,021
That was Nagel.

595
01:03:22,553 --> 01:03:24,453
Fatso Nagel!

596
01:03:31,945 --> 01:03:34,537
Good morning Mr. Nagel. Come in.

597
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:38,567
Why not. It's my office.
What are you doing in it?

598
01:03:38,932 --> 01:03:42,464
Making use of
a search warrant a judge gave us.

599
01:03:42,588 --> 01:03:46,547
- Police?
- F.B.I. Mr. Nagel.

600
01:03:47,843 --> 01:03:50,470
- Did you er...
find what you're looking for?

601
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:52,582
Yes, but not here.

602
01:03:52,778 --> 01:03:55,369
At the Midland First National,
up in Michigan.

603
01:03:56,581 --> 01:03:59,989
I don't recall doing any business
with Michigan banks.

604
01:04:00,238 --> 01:04:03,966
Do you recall doing any business
with Baby Face Nelson?

605
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:09,049
This is The Nagel, Blueprint
and Draughting Company, gentlemen.

606
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:11,091
Stop it Mr. Nagel.

607
01:04:11,446 --> 01:04:14,002
Nelson killed a federal agent
in Little Bohemia.

608
01:04:14,179 --> 01:04:17,126
You were there.
We can charge you as an accessory.

609
01:04:17,268 --> 01:04:18,617
Can you make the charge stick?

610
01:04:18,742 --> 01:04:21,866
Yes, but if you cooperate,
we'll inform the courts.

611
01:04:22,168 --> 01:04:23,943
Where is Nelson, Mr. Nagel?

612
01:04:24,085 --> 01:04:27,475
I don't know. D'you think
he tells people where he is.

613
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:30,937
- We want answers, not questions.
- Maybe I don't know any answers.

614
01:04:31,082 --> 01:04:34,135
Then what were you doing
at Little Bohemia?

615
01:04:36,159 --> 01:04:37,827
Say I was there.

616
01:04:37,970 --> 01:04:39,922
Say you tailed me there.

617
01:04:40,046 --> 01:04:44,467
Now wouldn't a fellow like Nelson
be cagy about seeing me again>

618
01:04:44,875 --> 01:04:46,668
We thought of that.

619
01:04:49,778 --> 01:04:52,174
This is his next job.

620
01:04:54,873 --> 01:04:57,713
- Go there?
- No, but you can say you did.

621
01:04:58,263 --> 01:05:00,446
The Brewers Bank and Trust in St. Paul.

622
01:05:00,553 --> 01:05:03,997
You can say there's $100,000 in it
any day of the week.

623
01:05:04,316 --> 01:05:08,293
I can say a lot of things, but how
do I get him to hold still and listen?

624
01:05:08,452 --> 01:05:11,115
Fatso, you've been in San Francisco.

625
01:05:11,293 --> 01:05:13,742
You've seen that big rock
out in the bay.

626
01:05:13,884 --> 01:05:16,387
You wouldn't want to spend
the rest of your life there.

627
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:20,373
So you figure out a way
to make him hold still and listen.

628
01:05:28,726 --> 01:05:30,199
Susie.

629
01:05:37,773 --> 01:05:42,122
Make a call to Daddy from a public phone
on the other side of town.

630
01:05:54,607 --> 01:05:56,027
Daddy?

631
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:01,406
- Yes Baby?
- 1- 1- 6- 2 State Street, Chicago.

632
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:05,152
11- 62 State Street.

633
01:06:05,436 --> 01:06:07,743
Noon tomorrow and how much?

634
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:12,359
Shall we say five Baby.
And it's worth every penny.

635
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:14,205
It better be.

636
01:06:14,702 --> 01:06:16,300
Better be.

637
01:06:51,975 --> 01:06:54,283
We'll take that Mr. Nagel.

638
01:06:54,478 --> 01:06:58,117
Say, how come you didn't tail her?
Or did you?

639
01:06:58,312 --> 01:07:00,300
We don't want her to know
we're on to you.

640
01:07:00,455 --> 01:07:03,490
How come you didn't ask the taxi
where he picked her up.

641
01:07:03,632 --> 01:07:05,599
Probably in front of Marshall Fields.

642
01:07:05,705 --> 01:07:08,279
But there's one thing
we're going to do,

643
01:07:08,368 --> 01:07:10,871
Turn you over to the police.

644
01:07:13,214 --> 01:07:15,717
The back entrance.
Here's the front.

645
01:07:17,665 --> 01:07:19,760
Right here is the vault.

646
01:07:20,363 --> 01:07:23,736
- Do you know the set up?
- You seen one bank you've seen them all

647
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:26,381
You figure on getting away in that?

648
01:07:27,323 --> 01:07:29,098
This is awful slow.

649
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:31,637
You drive up awful slow.

650
01:07:31,822 --> 01:07:34,999
Sue'll be out front to pick us up.
That's it.

651
01:09:19,708 --> 01:09:22,495
If he doesn't show up soon,
we'll wear out our welcome.

652
01:09:22,619 --> 01:09:27,324
- the help's getting awfully nervous.
- So am I but for a different reason.

653
01:09:27,625 --> 01:09:30,004
I'm wondering if he took the bait.

654
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:06,986
- We got a shipment for you.
- Hurry up, it's heavy.

655
01:10:18,117 --> 01:10:20,567
He'll sleep real good.

656
01:10:47,883 --> 01:10:51,646
The manager just took
some armed guards to the vault.

657
01:10:52,143 --> 01:10:56,386
They must be OK,
or Duncan wouldn't have passed them.

658
01:11:25,712 --> 01:11:27,469
Alright, reach up high Buddy.

659
01:11:27,575 --> 01:11:30,238
Hurry up.
Shut up and face the wall.

660
01:11:32,262 --> 01:11:34,126
Come on. Move.

661
01:11:42,304 --> 01:11:43,972
Right, give it to me.

662
01:11:49,014 --> 01:11:52,617
Alright boys, I've got mine.
You can divvy up the rest.

663
01:12:54,317 --> 01:12:56,749
Alright Sue, I'll take the wheel.

664
01:12:58,311 --> 01:13:00,477
Where are the others?

665
01:13:00,867 --> 01:13:02,713
Back in the vault counting their money.

666
01:13:02,838 --> 01:13:05,039
- You left them behind?
- We don't need them any more.

667
01:13:05,110 --> 01:13:07,666
That money'll keep up
for the rest of our lives.

668
01:13:07,808 --> 01:13:10,258
- They'll tell the cops.
- We're not going back there.

669
01:13:10,364 --> 01:13:12,299
Where we're going,
they'll never look for us.

670
01:13:12,424 --> 01:13:14,767
Going back to the same hideout.

671
01:13:28,979 --> 01:13:31,748
Ditch the car whilst I change clothes.

672
01:14:29,392 --> 01:14:33,688
- Hey, you missed him again.
- Look at those feathers flying around.

673
01:14:38,256 --> 01:14:41,700
- Who wants an old crow anyway?
- I want one.

674
01:15:01,347 --> 01:15:05,004
We ought to be getting home.
Ma'll skin up if we're late for supper.

675
01:15:05,164 --> 01:15:08,146
If you're so worried about Mom,
go on home.

676
01:15:57,817 --> 01:16:00,551
- A couple of kids up there.
- I know.

677
01:16:04,797 --> 01:16:06,732
Lie to me Baby.

678
01:16:07,087 --> 01:16:09,288
Tell me you wouldn't have killed them.

679
01:16:10,531 --> 01:16:12,554
I wouldn't have killed them.

680
01:16:26,177 --> 01:16:28,076
Dinner's on.

681
01:16:37,666 --> 01:16:39,530
Wait a minute.

682
01:16:39,619 --> 01:16:41,217
You forgot to give thanks.

683
01:16:41,394 --> 01:16:42,814
Thanks.

684
01:16:43,010 --> 01:16:45,583
We got a lot to be thankful for.
We're alive ain't we.

685
01:16:45,709 --> 01:16:47,680
Sure we're alive.

686
01:16:48,088 --> 01:16:49,774
We're really living.

687
01:16:50,183 --> 01:16:52,916
We got stew... and bread.

688
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:56,176
And a sack full of money under the bed
we can't even spend.

689
01:16:56,283 --> 01:16:59,407
It'll be the same
in Canada as it is here.

690
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:03,385
- In Montreal there are boats leaving...
- When? When?

691
01:17:05,533 --> 01:17:07,201
A week or two.

692
01:17:08,568 --> 01:17:13,077
A week or two.
It'll always be a week or two.

693
01:17:16,602 --> 01:17:18,714
Wanna call it quits?

694
01:17:25,985 --> 01:17:27,476
No!

695
01:17:28,364 --> 01:17:30,032
No I couldn't.

696
01:17:31,275 --> 01:17:34,092
I went into this thing
knowing the score.

697
01:17:34,198 --> 01:17:37,003
Knowing our time was running out fast.

698
01:17:38,601 --> 01:17:40,944
Let's hope it keeps on running.

699
01:17:41,352 --> 01:17:42,737
Slow.

700
01:17:59,586 --> 01:18:00,776
Hi.

701
01:18:00,882 --> 01:18:03,740
We're looking for someone
who knows this area well.

702
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:05,604
- Hunting or fishing?
- Hunting.

703
01:18:05,817 --> 01:18:08,480
Not around here Mister.
Everything's out of season.

704
01:18:08,924 --> 01:18:11,870
What we're hunting
never goes out of season.

705
01:18:12,474 --> 01:18:14,569
I know just the man for you.

706
01:18:14,977 --> 01:18:18,137
I'll show you
where to find him in a minute.

707
01:18:18,651 --> 01:18:21,279
Be a dollar five Ma'am.

708
01:18:27,550 --> 01:18:31,988
On up the road, about three quarters
of a mile. A guy called Bill Harris.

709
01:18:37,381 --> 01:18:38,535
Baby.

710
01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:43,381
What's up?

711
01:18:43,541 --> 01:18:46,399
Two men in a car
asking for someone to guide them.

712
01:18:46,559 --> 01:18:48,085
No hunters up here.

713
01:18:48,369 --> 01:18:52,008
- Everything's out of season.
- What they're hunting is us.

714
01:19:08,817 --> 01:19:12,101
Pull up and turn around.
That looked like Nelson.

715
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:32,079
Send out an all points alarm.

716
01:19:32,221 --> 01:19:34,813
Nelson is heading North on Highway 12.

717
01:19:59,976 --> 01:20:01,875
Hand me that chopper.

718
01:21:00,455 --> 01:21:02,248
We lost them.

719
01:21:07,033 --> 01:21:09,732
He's pulling away from us,
still heading North.

720
01:21:11,418 --> 01:21:13,868
We're all set up for him.

721
01:21:36,834 --> 01:21:38,290
Get down!

722
01:21:51,112 --> 01:21:53,189
They hit the radiator.

723
01:22:13,883 --> 01:22:16,475
Grab the money and make a run for it.

724
01:22:32,971 --> 01:22:35,510
Baby!

725
01:23:15,194 --> 01:23:17,360
Help me... here.

726
01:23:18,212 --> 01:23:22,313
You... fin...
finish... finish me... Sue.

727
01:23:23,573 --> 01:23:26,342
No I can't... I can't.

728
01:23:28,224 --> 01:23:30,265
Those... kids that day.

729
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:34,117
I was...
I was gonna...

730
01:23:34,419 --> 01:23:37,632
I WAS GONNA... KILL 'EM!

731
01:24:03,769 --> 01:24:05,863
