00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:57.444
There is nothing a father
wouldn't do for his son.

2
00:00:57.445 --> 00:01:00.171
Your mother never
understood this.

3
00:01:00.172 --> 00:01:02.932
She looked at you
and saw a monster.

4
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:05.107
I saw potential.

5
00:01:05.108 --> 00:01:08.593
When a bully took your
money, you took his eye.

6
00:01:08.594 --> 00:01:12.217
When they called you crazy,
you took their tongues.

7
00:01:12.218 --> 00:01:14.875
But I brought you here today.

8
00:01:14.876 --> 00:01:16.566
Was it generosity?

9
00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:18.672
Love?

10
00:01:18.673 --> 00:01:20.018
No.

11
00:01:20.019 --> 00:01:22.641
It's so what I built
doesn't die with me.

12
00:01:22.642 --> 00:01:24.402
So my legacy can live on,

13
00:01:24.403 --> 00:01:27.577
because a father and
his son is everything.

14
00:01:27.578 --> 00:01:30.097
I have a job that I can
only trust with one man.

15
00:01:30.098 --> 00:01:31.616
You.

16
00:01:31.617 --> 00:01:34.550
My most ruthless soldiers
were watching our cash houses,

17
00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:37.794
and they let this Dominic
Toretto burn what is mine.

18
00:01:37.795 --> 00:01:39.521
I'll kill Dominic Toretto.

19
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.005
I'll kill 'em all.

20
00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:44.594
Kill them? You'd
show them mercy?

21
00:01:44.595 --> 00:01:45.975
No, my son.

22
00:01:45.976 --> 00:01:50.394
When suffering is owed, never
accept death as a payment.

23
00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:55.779
Make Toretto suffer.

24
00:02:11.588 --> 00:02:14.935
Now the work begins.

25
00:02:14.936 --> 00:02:16.661
And in there,

26
00:02:16.662 --> 00:02:20.493
today we'll put our family
on a path to real power.

27
00:02:21.701 --> 00:02:23.669
Let's get started.

28
00:04:15.643 --> 00:04:17.472
Shit!

29
00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:48.399
Hey, there's too many of them!

30
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.480
- We're not gonna make it.
- You're right. We aren't.

31
00:04:50.885 --> 00:04:52.368
- You are.
- No, I'm not leaving you.

32
00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:54.163
Now, you stick with the plan.

33
00:04:54.164 --> 00:04:55.855
It was always the plan.

34
00:05:47.217 --> 00:05:48.529
Get him.

35
00:06:29.708 --> 00:06:31.260

I didn't have it.

49
00:07:16.513 --> 00:07:18.963
B, no one starts
at the finish line.

50
00:07:18.964 --> 00:07:21.137
You got to have faith.

51
00:07:21.138 --> 00:07:22.829
Remember today's lesson.

52
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.521
Find the line,

53
00:07:25.522 --> 00:07:27.523
feel the car,

54
00:07:27.524 --> 00:07:28.869
and let it fly.

55
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.975
- It's okay to be afraid.

56
00:07:30.976 --> 00:07:33.253
Sometimes fear can
be the best teacher.

57
00:07:33.254 --> 00:07:34.807
I wasn't scared.

58
00:07:36.015 --> 00:07:37.706
- Everyone gets scared, son.
- You don't.

59
00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:39.640
You're not afraid of anything.

60
00:07:41.883 --> 00:07:43.643
We better hurry.

61
00:07:43.644 --> 00:07:45.541
- Great-Grandma just flew in.

62
00:07:45.542 --> 00:07:47.888
And she's making
her famous maduros.

63
00:07:47.889 --> 00:07:50.650
We got to get to those
before Uncle Roman does.

64
00:07:50.651 --> 00:07:52.237

living. Told you guys,</i>

73
00:08:13.363 --> 00:08:14.363
<i>I don't need that.</i>

74
00:08:14.364 --> 00:08:17.297
There, profile done.

75
00:08:17.298 --> 00:08:18.747
You're welcome.

76
00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:20.196
Now, you give it about
three, four days...

77
00:08:20.197 --> 00:08:21.543
- It never happens instantly.

78
00:08:21.544 --> 00:08:23.303
- Wait, what? Hmm.

79
00:08:23.304 --> 00:08:24.615
Wow.

80
00:08:24.616 --> 00:08:25.961
Let me see your
profile picture again.

81
00:08:25.962 --> 00:08:27.238
He must have put
a filter on there.

82
00:08:27.239 --> 00:08:28.860
What are you guys looking at?

83
00:08:28.861 --> 00:08:30.379
- Oh, wait. No, no, no, no.
- They're just video games, man.

84
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.622
- H-H-Hold on, man.
- Just videos, man.

85
00:08:31.623 --> 00:08:32.830
Can I sit next to you?

86
00:08:32.831 --> 00:08:33.763
Boy nosy.
- You drifting yet?

87
00:08:33.764 --> 00:08:35.004
I am.

88
00:08:35.005 --> 00:08:38.111
You should've seen us.
It was so cool, Mom.

89
00:08:38.112 --> 00:08:39.491
Hey!

90
00:08:39.492 --> 00:08:40.492
!¡Oye, familia!

91
00:08:40.493 --> 00:08:41.977
I am starving!

92
00:08:41.978 --> 00:08:43.668
- Come on.

93
00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:46.844
I also want a hug from
every single person in...

94
00:08:46.845 --> 00:08:48.224
Oh.

95
00:08:48.225 --> 00:08:49.812
- Ah.
- You see the line?

96
00:08:49.813 --> 00:08:51.607
We're all waiting in line
for this love, abuelita.

97
00:08:51.608 --> 00:08:53.644
- Oh, yeah.
- Wait till you taste this.

98
00:08:53.645 --> 00:08:54.748
It's really good.

99
00:08:54.749 --> 00:08:56.612
I put myself out for this one.

100
00:08:56.613 --> 00:08:58.063
- Oh.

101
00:09:01.653 --> 00:09:02.860
Okay, everybody
pipe down, please.

102
00:09:02.861 --> 00:09:04.828
Abuelita would like
to say something.

103
00:09:05.933 --> 00:09:08.520
- Piping and downing, please.

104
00:09:08.521 --> 00:09:11.765
As I look out at this
wonderful family,

105
00:09:11.766 --> 00:09:17.115
I am filled with so much pride.

106
00:09:17.116 --> 00:09:20.567
The kind of pride that
my son... Your father...

107
00:09:20.568 --> 00:09:22.465
Would have enjoyed
if he were here.

108
00:09:22.466 --> 00:09:26.366
I know that this road
has been very hard

109
00:09:26.367 --> 00:09:29.128
and also not fair.

110
00:09:30.578 --> 00:09:32.648
And yet here you are,

111
00:09:32.649 --> 00:09:35.271
despite all of the odds,

112
00:09:35.272 --> 00:09:37.584
building this magnificent

113
00:09:37.585 --> 00:09:39.622
- leg...

114
00:09:47.043 --> 00:09:50.183
It is a legacy that will
go on for generations.

115
00:09:50.184 --> 00:09:51.633
No one can take it away.

116
00:09:51.634 --> 00:09:53.565
Not now.

117
00:09:53.566 --> 00:09:55.015
Not ever.

118
00:09:55.016 --> 00:09:58.087
- Yeah!

119
00:09:58.088 --> 00:09:59.157
To familia.

120
00:09:59.158 --> 00:10:02.126
Familia.

121
00:10:02.127 --> 00:10:04.266
Siempre. Always.

122
00:10:04.267 --> 00:10:06.096
♪ Costa Rica...

123
00:10:07.063 --> 00:10:09.858
Hey, these new Nikes, man.
Stop playing! Goddamn...

124
00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:12.308
Come on, Roman. The
agency put you in charge,

125
00:10:12.309 --> 00:10:13.482
and you said I get to drive.

126
00:10:13.483 --> 00:10:15.311
See, what I really need

127
00:10:15.312 --> 00:10:16.417
is I need your brain.

128
00:10:17.694 --> 00:10:19.420
Words Roman Pearce
has never said.

129
00:10:20.835 --> 00:10:22.525
So talk me through it
again. I need details.

130
00:10:22.526 --> 00:10:25.183
Yeah, the agency got a tip on
some stolen military hardware.

131
00:10:25.184 --> 00:10:27.323
Tomorrow, a next-gen
quantum computer chip

132
00:10:27.324 --> 00:10:29.567
will be transported through
the streets of Rome,

133
00:10:29.568 --> 00:10:30.741
and they need us to steal it.

134
00:10:30.742 --> 00:10:32.674
I checked Roman's intel.

135
00:10:32.675 --> 00:10:33.709
It's legit.

136
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:34.779
Of course it's legit.

137
00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.125
We're talking 'bout Rome.

138
00:10:36.126 --> 00:10:38.369
Rome. Roman.

139
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:39.784
Come on, man.

140
00:10:39.785 --> 00:10:41.372
That's like planning a
heist in my backyard.

141
00:10:41.373 --> 00:10:43.823
Only thing you know about
Rome is "ro-man" noodles.

142
00:10:43.824 --> 00:10:45.756
One thing you didn't
explain to us is:

143
00:10:45.757 --> 00:10:47.240
Why the hell do
we need a RC car,

144
00:10:47.241 --> 00:10:50.761
a gold Lamborghini and
12 tanks of laughing gas?

145
00:10:50.762 --> 00:10:52.141
Yes, I'm in, 'cause
you are definitely

146
00:10:52.142 --> 00:10:53.625
going to need all the
brains you can get.

147
00:10:53.626 --> 00:10:55.041
You up to something.

148
00:10:55.042 --> 00:10:56.663
Hey, Rome...
- Don't talk to me, man.

149
00:10:56.664 --> 00:10:58.009
Don't talk to me.

150
00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:59.597
- All right.
- You know what?

151
00:10:59.598 --> 00:11:02.911
The disrespect is
gon' have to stop.

152
00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:04.603
Now!

153
00:11:06.294 --> 00:11:08.399
That's just my... You
know what I'm saying?

154
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.747
Me just, you know, practicing
my leadership voice.

155
00:11:11.748 --> 00:11:14.612
I see what's going on.

156
00:11:14.613 --> 00:11:16.510
Tej, you think you slick, bro.

157
00:11:16.511 --> 00:11:17.649
Look at you.

158
00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:18.996
Spying on me.

159
00:11:18.997 --> 00:11:20.791
What's up with this
old boat anchor?

160
00:11:20.792 --> 00:11:21.964
No fuel injection.

161
00:11:21.965 --> 00:11:23.414
I mean, I'd expect
something bigger

162
00:11:23.415 --> 00:11:24.691
and better from you, Dom.

163
00:11:24.692 --> 00:11:26.072
Little B and I are
building it together.

164
00:11:26.073 --> 00:11:28.902
The carburetor
forces him to listen.

165
00:11:28.903 --> 00:11:30.421
That's the problem nowadays.

166
00:11:30.422 --> 00:11:32.147
- Nobody listens anymore.
- Well, you better watch out.

167
00:11:32.148 --> 00:11:34.943
Little man's gonna be a
better wrench than any of us

168
00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:36.254
by the time he's 12.

169
00:11:36.255 --> 00:11:38.050
I mean, that's the
whole point, isn't it?

170
00:11:39.672 --> 00:11:41.570
Pass it down.

171
00:11:41.571 --> 00:11:43.849
Each generation
better than the last.

172
00:11:45.092 --> 00:11:46.437
That's true.

173
00:11:46.438 --> 00:11:47.853
That's fatherhood.

174
00:11:49.199 --> 00:11:51.994
Come a long way from the
two of us popping gas trucks

175
00:11:51.995 --> 00:11:54.100
- in the D.R., huh?
- We sure did.

176
00:11:54.101 --> 00:11:56.792
Those were some tough times.

177
00:11:56.793 --> 00:11:59.037
Those were some great times.

178
00:12:05.215 --> 00:12:07.630
Oh, you... Y-Y'all

Han, let's go, man.

182
00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:15.638
Roman asked if he could
lead this mission.

183
00:12:15.639 --> 00:12:17.364
How could I tell him no?

184
00:12:17.365 --> 00:12:20.368
But you know I can't let
them go to Rome without you.

lose your way.

But I am.

212
00:15:04.153 --> 00:15:07.018
I'm afraid of losing a son.

00:16:15.051 --> 00:16:17.709
I'm as surprised as you are.

221
00:16:21.437 --> 00:16:24.577

229
00:16:45.771 --> 00:16:50.120
Did you hear Elena's last words

230
00:16:50.121 --> 00:16:51.914
before you killed her?

231
00:16:51.915 --> 00:16:55.608
Then don't you think I'd have a
goddamn good reason to be here?

232
00:16:55.609 --> 00:16:58.129
Maybe the only reason
that's ever mattered to you.

We have an unwanted guest.

236
00:17:06.827 --> 00:17:08.277
You know what to do.

237
00:17:20.185 --> 00:17:21.875

240

Honestly, I always
thought it was me.

241
00:17:37.237 --> 00:17:39.584
So that was kind
of disappointing.

you're facing death,

246
00:18:00.156 --> 00:18:02.124
Are they right?

247
00:18:06.956 --> 00:18:09.130
I'd start with who you are.

248
00:18:09.131 --> 00:18:11.339
A question most can't
answer in a lifetime.

249
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.789
You have three seconds.

250
00:18:15.896 --> 00:18:17.345
Before you bleed
out on my couch,

251
00:18:17.346 --> 00:18:19.761
you might want to
explain why you're here.

252
00:18:19.762 --> 00:18:22.626
I'm here

253
00:18:22.627 --> 00:18:24.938
because the enemy

254
00:18:24.939 --> 00:18:27.769

255
00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:28.839

259
00:18:34.742 --> 00:18:37.710
And I'm here for the
same reasons you are.

260
00:18:37.711 --> 00:18:39.643
Dominic Toretto.

261
00:18:39.644 --> 00:18:41.023

263

No, no, no.

264
00:18:44.718 --> 00:18:49.204
Never accept death
when suffering is owed.

265
00:18:49.205 --> 00:18:51.862
But I need your help.

266
00:18:51.863 --> 00:18:54.589
Your toys and your tech.

267
00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.177

with me or you're...

I don't play well with others.

270
00:19:01.286 --> 00:19:03.218
Then you'll have to watch
who you love most die.

271
00:19:03.219 --> 00:19:04.771
You're looking at
who I love most.

272
00:19:04.772 --> 00:19:07.981
You thought you could use
my own move against me?

273
00:19:07.982 --> 00:19:10.225
I wasn't talking to you.

274
00:19:10.226 --> 00:19:11.883

Me or...

285
00:20:04.453 --> 00:20:07.352
You want to control the world.

286
00:20:09.078 --> 00:20:11.977
I just want to punish it.

287
00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:19.950
I will remember this.

288
00:20:19.951 --> 00:20:22.091

298

good help these days.

301
00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:06.082

will be destroyed.

We're in. I have the wheel.

386
00:27:30.864 --> 00:27:32.106
We're locked inside!

387
00:27:32.107 --> 00:27:34.557
The truck's being
steered remotely.

388
00:27:44.567 --> 00:27:48.088
And a one, and a two, and a...

389
00:27:57.753 --> 00:28:00.790

390
00:28:00.791 --> 00:28:03.379

They're stealing our truck.

395
00:28:20.707 --> 00:28:22.778
And with us inside.

396
00:28:24.193 --> 00:28:28.058
Just got reports of two
explosions near the Forum.

397
00:28:28.059 --> 00:28:29.716
That's them.

398
00:28:34.445 --> 00:28:37.033

399
00:28:37.034 --> 00:28:38.551
- Wait, you hear that?

400
00:28:38.552 --> 00:28:40.934
- What the hell is that?!
- I have no idea!

401
00:28:44.075 --> 00:28:45.007
Oh, shit.

402
00:28:45.008 --> 00:28:46.387
That's a big-ass bomb!

403
00:28:46.388 --> 00:28:48.147
- What?
- Bomb!

404
00:28:48.148 --> 00:28:50.253
Roman, you said this
was carrying chips

405
00:28:50.254 --> 00:28:51.495
for a supercomputer.

406
00:28:51.496 --> 00:28:52.877
That is not a
chip. It's a bomb!

407
00:28:53.982 --> 00:28:55.361
What happens if it goes off?

408
00:28:55.362 --> 00:28:57.605
What do you mean, "What
happens if it goes off?"

409
00:28:57.606 --> 00:28:59.434
The Seven Hills of Rome will
be down to two and a half!

410
00:28:59.435 --> 00:29:02.679
City-wide devastation,
countless lives lost.

411
00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.405
You know, the thing bombs do.

412
00:29:04.406 --> 00:29:06.270
We're coming to you.

413
00:29:10.688 --> 00:29:13.034
All right, dorks. What
are we blowing up?

414
00:29:13.035 --> 00:29:14.173
What?

415
00:29:14.174 --> 00:29:15.554
The Vatican?

416
00:29:15.555 --> 00:29:17.280
Wow.

417
00:29:17.281 --> 00:29:18.695
Okay. I'll do it.

418
00:29:18.696 --> 00:29:20.594
But you guys are going to hell.

419
00:29:21.733 --> 00:29:23.805
<i>That's their truck.</i>

420
00:29:26.911 --> 00:29:28.429
Oh, thank God. Dom, Letty.

421
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:30.672
Ooh. Look who's here.

422
00:29:30.673 --> 00:29:31.812
You're right on time, Dominic.

423
00:29:31.813 --> 00:29:33.607
Turn off the encrypted radio.

424
00:29:35.437 --> 00:29:36.851
Ramsey?

425
00:29:36.852 --> 00:29:39.336
We're being remote-controlled.
There's a bomb on board.

426
00:29:39.337 --> 00:29:42.237
It's a DM-79 subnautical
high-yield neutron mine.

427
00:29:44.135 --> 00:29:45.860
Ah! Found it.

428
00:29:45.861 --> 00:29:48.069
I can disarm it with
an agency kill switch.

429
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:50.106
I just need physical
hands on the device.

430
00:29:50.107 --> 00:29:52.004
- We have to stop that truck.
- Sorry, Captain America.

431
00:29:52.005 --> 00:29:53.627
Can't let you do that.

432
00:29:55.353 --> 00:29:58.909
<i>We got to hurry! The
truck is speeding up.</i>

433
00:30:00.048 --> 00:30:02.670
- We got to block its path.
- I'm gonna get ahead of it.

434
00:30:02.671 --> 00:30:05.122
Ramsey, Tej, strap in.

435
00:30:07.745 --> 00:30:09.436
Whoop.

436
00:30:19.412 --> 00:30:20.482
Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

437
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:26.315
Dom, go ahead! I'm pinched!

438
00:30:27.834 --> 00:30:29.077
Dominic.

439
00:30:31.148 --> 00:30:32.287
Come on!

440
00:30:33.771 --> 00:30:35.393
Damn it, he's fast.

441
00:30:42.953 --> 00:30:44.470
Really? The clothesline?

442
00:30:44.471 --> 00:30:45.920
Well, we can't drive it,

443
00:30:45.921 --> 00:30:47.578
guess we're just
gonna have to roll it.

444
00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:09.840
Holy shit! The truck's
about to go over the hill!

445
00:31:09.841 --> 00:31:12.396
- We have to crash into it.
- We have to what?!

446
00:31:26.272 --> 00:31:29.206
I'm so sorry, my gold baby!

447
00:31:30.621 --> 00:31:32.278
<i>It's not stopping!</i>

448
00:31:33.969 --> 00:31:36.075
<i>Dom, the bomb is out.</i>

449
00:31:38.801 --> 00:31:41.286
Everybody, stay
clear. I got this.

450
00:31:41.287 --> 00:31:43.151
No. We got this.

451
00:31:56.336 --> 00:31:58.028
Letty!

452
00:32:09.832 --> 00:32:11.281
Have we made them
all terrorists?

453
00:32:11.282 --> 00:32:12.869
Their images have been
fed to the authorities.

454
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:15.216
All right, Bob! I got
to go kill that jerk

455
00:32:15.217 --> 00:32:16.942
that's trying to disarm my bomb.

456
00:32:16.943 --> 00:32:18.599
It's always something,
you know? Oh.

457
00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.637
Remember, I still have your
families, so don't go anywhere.

458
00:32:54.808 --> 00:32:57.362
<i>Buongiorno, Roma!</i>

459
00:32:57.363 --> 00:32:58.847
All right.

460
00:33:07.994 --> 00:33:09.822
Man, who the hell is that?

461
00:33:09.823 --> 00:33:11.272
Hey! There he is!

462
00:33:11.273 --> 00:33:13.619
Man of the hour. Roman
Pearce, team leader.

463
00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:16.278
Can't wait to see you
get out of this one.

464
00:33:22.215 --> 00:33:24.631
DANTE [singsongy]: Oh, Letty!

465
00:33:25.874 --> 00:33:27.012
I think I found our guy.

466
00:33:27.013 --> 00:33:28.980
Hey, Letty. <i>Vaffanculo!</i>

467
00:33:30.085 --> 00:33:31.604
I'm on him.

468
00:33:45.204 --> 00:33:47.585
That pump's gonna blow.

469
00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.812
<i>Little Nobody, you're up.</i>

470
00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:50.579
- Moving to dis...
- Peekaboo!

471
00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:01.797
Get out of there! It's gonna blow!
-Oh, shit.

472
00:35:05.076 --> 00:35:06.630
- Boom.

473
00:36:07.346 --> 00:36:09.347
We need to jam
the detonator now.

474
00:36:09.348 --> 00:36:11.591
I got it, I got it.
Letty, don't lose him.

475
00:36:13.628 --> 00:36:15.629
I can lock on to your
location and transmit

476
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:17.389
cellular interference
through your phone.

477
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:19.944
That should jam his detonator
and buy us some time.

478
00:36:23.983 --> 00:36:25.018
Letty.

479
00:37:07.647 --> 00:37:08.992
Bravo!

480
00:37:08.993 --> 00:37:10.339
It's getting tricky, guys.

481
00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:12.202
I can't stay on him
for much longer.

482
00:37:12.203 --> 00:37:14.101
Ramsey, how deep is that river?

483
00:37:14.102 --> 00:37:16.206
The Tiber? Uh...

484
00:37:16.207 --> 00:37:17.656
Uh, 60 feet.

485
00:37:17.657 --> 00:37:19.244
I mean, the water could
smother the explosion,

486
00:37:19.245 --> 00:37:21.454
reduce its power by
ten times, maybe.

487
00:37:37.436 --> 00:37:39.610
Damn it!

488
00:37:40.542 --> 00:37:43.649
You missed me by
that much, baby!

489
00:37:47.825 --> 00:37:49.481
I lost him. He's gone.

490
00:37:49.482 --> 00:37:51.000
Damn!

491
00:37:51.001 --> 00:37:52.139
He's out of our reach.

492
00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.623
We can't jam the signal anymore.

493
00:37:53.624 --> 00:37:56.558
Bad news, Dom. I'm
back in business.

494
00:38:06.706 --> 00:38:08.743
You got 30 seconds to save Rome.

495
00:38:10.089 --> 00:38:14.680
<i>Dom, he armed the bomb, and
you're almost at the river.</i>

496
00:38:48.058 --> 00:38:50.197
15 seconds, Dom.

497
00:38:50.198 --> 00:38:52.406
Dom, listen to me.

498
00:38:52.407 --> 00:38:53.925
The Vatican's within
the blast radius.

499
00:38:53.926 --> 00:38:55.340
Get out of there.

<i>Two.</i>

506

<i>One.</i>

507
00:40:01.338 --> 00:40:03.582
<i>What have we done?</i>

508
00:40:06.032 --> 00:40:10.899
Through your suffering,
I'll fulfill my destiny.

To be a large military weapon.

some structural damage.

517
00:40:34.751 --> 00:40:36.511
But no lives were claimed.

00:41:12.547 --> 00:41:14.030
just 'cause your daddy's
an agency legend?

536
00:41:14.031 --> 00:41:15.722
I'm here because
someone needs to speak

537
00:41:15.723 --> 00:41:17.344
on behalf of the defense.

538
00:41:17.345 --> 00:41:19.760
What just happened in Rome
was an unmitigated disaster.

539
00:41:19.761 --> 00:41:21.451
Casualties were
kept to a minimum,

540
00:41:21.452 --> 00:41:22.798
but the impact was global.

541
00:41:22.799 --> 00:41:25.386
And what do you think
happened in Italy?

542
00:41:25.387 --> 00:41:28.735
Oh, sightseeing,
eating bucatini,

543
00:41:28.736 --> 00:41:30.771
- stealing a 20-kiloton bomb.
- Oh, come on, Aimes.

544
00:41:30.772 --> 00:41:33.360
That's bullshit and you know it.
-Careful, now.

545
00:41:33.361 --> 00:41:35.017
With Little Nobody
out of commission

546
00:41:35.018 --> 00:41:38.538
and your daddy in the wind,
you're talking to the new boss.

547
00:41:38.539 --> 00:41:40.574
Showtime.

548
00:41:40.575 --> 00:41:42.611
Los Angeles, 2001.

549
00:41:42.612 --> 00:41:45.096
Humble roots, local kids,

550
00:41:45.097 --> 00:41:47.788
street racers who
became hijackers.

551
00:41:47.789 --> 00:41:50.377
Graduated to
high-speed smuggling,

552
00:41:50.378 --> 00:41:51.965
mobile jailbreaks,
train robberies.

553
00:41:51.966 --> 00:41:54.864
If it could be done
in a car, they did it.

554
00:41:54.865 --> 00:41:58.592
If it violates the laws of God
and gravity, they did it twice.

555
00:41:58.593 --> 00:42:01.181
You write that yourself?

556
00:42:01.182 --> 00:42:03.114
We first took notice in 2011,

557
00:42:03.115 --> 00:42:06.600
Rio, when they robbed a
drug kingpin, Hernan Reyes,

558
00:42:06.601 --> 00:42:08.568
left his body on a bridge.

559
00:42:08.569 --> 00:42:12.157
My predecessor,
Mr. Nobody, saw potential,

560
00:42:12.158 --> 00:42:14.539
so he recruited them...
Freelance, of course.

561
00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:16.679
They ran missions
for us in Abu Dhabi,

562
00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:19.475
Tokyo, London,
New York, Tbilisi.

563
00:42:19.476 --> 00:42:21.408
You ask me, we should've
cut ties years back,

564
00:42:21.409 --> 00:42:24.066
but they had their champions.

565
00:42:24.067 --> 00:42:25.515
That's their M.O.

566
00:42:25.516 --> 00:42:27.414
To corrupt law enforcement.

567
00:42:27.415 --> 00:42:28.726
Brian O'Conner.

568
00:42:28.727 --> 00:42:30.624
Elena Neves. Luke Hobbs.

569
00:42:30.625 --> 00:42:32.522
Everyone becomes family.

570
00:42:32.523 --> 00:42:34.455
It's like a cult with cars.

571
00:42:34.456 --> 00:42:37.977
Even Tess's dear old dad.

572
00:42:38.771 --> 00:42:40.047
So we're all just

573
00:42:40.048 --> 00:42:42.636
a barbecue and a beer
away from corruption?

574
00:42:42.637 --> 00:42:43.913
What's your point?

575
00:42:43.914 --> 00:42:45.466
Point is they're criminals.

576
00:42:45.467 --> 00:42:47.227
Rome was a matter of time.

577
00:42:47.228 --> 00:42:48.918
They've stolen hundreds
of millions of dollars

578
00:42:48.919 --> 00:42:52.232
and at least one nuclear sub.

579
00:42:52.233 --> 00:42:55.960
The real question is: How did
we let this go on so long?

580
00:42:55.961 --> 00:42:58.514
This family has gotten their
hands dirty to keep ours clean.

581
00:42:58.515 --> 00:43:02.345
They've driven to the gates of
hell and back for this agency.

582
00:43:02.346 --> 00:43:04.244
Something is not
right with Rome.

583
00:43:04.245 --> 00:43:05.383
It can't be.

584
00:43:05.384 --> 00:43:07.730
It can and it is.

585
00:43:07.731 --> 00:43:09.559
The agency is better than this.

586
00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.009
We are smarter than this.

587
00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:12.701
We should be standing
with Dom and his family.

588
00:43:12.702 --> 00:43:14.219
That is the very
least that we can do.

589
00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:16.014
If we don't act, this
blows back on all of us.

590
00:43:16.015 --> 00:43:18.915
The fallout will be existential.

591
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:22.987
I'm asking for full
green-light authority.

592
00:43:22.988 --> 00:43:25.610
Kill or capture the
Toretto clan by any means.

593
00:43:25.611 --> 00:43:27.613
Aimes, what are you doing?

594
00:43:34.344 --> 00:43:36.345
Looks like the ayes have it.

595
00:43:36.346 --> 00:43:38.140
As your direct superior,

596
00:43:38.141 --> 00:43:40.763
I don't give a shit about
anybody's heart of gold,

597
00:43:40.764 --> 00:43:43.697
and I hate barbecues.

598
00:43:43.698 --> 00:43:46.251
You know I'd make a freight
train take a dirt road,

599
00:43:46.252 --> 00:43:49.393
so do not get in my way.

600
00:43:52.327 --> 00:43:53.915
Okay.

601
00:43:57.194 --> 00:43:58.609
I'll go my own way.

602
00:44:00.508 --> 00:44:04.339
♪ My world has fallen

603
00:44:05.547 --> 00:44:08.343
♪ I'm falling to my knees

604
00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:11.207
♪ Oh, yeah

605
00:44:11.208 --> 00:44:15.453
♪ And now I feel my
hands trembling ♪

606
00:44:15.454 --> 00:44:16.972
♪ Oh, Lord

607
00:44:16.973 --> 00:44:21.425
♪ Ain't no promise
I'll breathe again. ♪

608
00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:30.226
When Rome falls,
so does the world.

609
00:44:30.227 --> 00:44:33.505
Well, it ain't no Roman holiday.

610
00:44:33.506 --> 00:44:36.336
And you're no Gregory Peck.

611
00:44:36.337 --> 00:44:38.269
Mm.

612
00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:39.788
My family?

613
00:44:39.789 --> 00:44:43.550
Your team's gone to ground.
They're safe for now.

614
00:44:43.551 --> 00:44:46.071
They've taken Letty.

615
00:44:47.417 --> 00:44:49.625
- Who's they?
- The agency.

616
00:44:49.626 --> 00:44:51.420
And you've just
shot to number one

617
00:44:51.421 --> 00:44:53.077
on the world's most wanted list.

618
00:44:53.078 --> 00:44:56.563
Whoever did this wanted to
sever your ties to the agency

619
00:44:56.564 --> 00:44:58.461
and isolate you
from your family.

620
00:44:58.462 --> 00:45:01.775
Any attempt to contact
your team will be traced.

621
00:45:01.776 --> 00:45:04.295
I need you to get a
message to Mr. Nobody.

622
00:45:04.296 --> 00:45:06.953
You'll need a medium
for that or a magician.

623
00:45:06.954 --> 00:45:08.989
He's done his disappearing act.

624
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:11.612
Just get the message out.

625
00:45:11.613 --> 00:45:13.822
Tell him I'm ready
to have that Belgian,

626
00:45:13.823 --> 00:45:15.099
and he'll know where to go.

627
00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:16.790
I've got a message
for you, ducky.

628
00:45:16.791 --> 00:45:20.104
The world is on fire, and
you want to keep running

629
00:45:20.105 --> 00:45:22.485
into the burning
building to save lives,

630
00:45:22.486 --> 00:45:25.765
but eventually the building's
gonna collapse on you.

631
00:45:25.766 --> 00:45:27.457
I don't care about dying.

632
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:32.773
I only care about protecting
the people that I love.

633
00:45:33.843 --> 00:45:36.568
You know why gladiators
never had families?

634
00:45:36.569 --> 00:45:38.674
- Why?
- Because they knew

635
00:45:38.675 --> 00:45:41.297
that every day
might be their last.

636
00:45:41.298 --> 00:45:45.508
You're choosing a
lonely way, my darling.

637
00:45:45.509 --> 00:45:48.202
Can't take anyone with you.

638
00:46:08.912 --> 00:46:10.775
Bring God's Eye online.

639
00:46:10.776 --> 00:46:12.846
Yes, sir. Initiating.

640
00:46:12.847 --> 00:46:14.710
Get me Toretto and
the others' locations

641
00:46:14.711 --> 00:46:16.160
to the millimeter.

642
00:46:16.161 --> 00:46:17.851
Sir, we have a problem.

643
00:46:17.852 --> 00:46:19.715
The God's Eye tracking
hardware has been removed.

644
00:46:19.716 --> 00:46:21.406
Tess.

645
00:46:21.407 --> 00:46:23.857
I guess her visit wasn't
purely a social call.

646
00:46:23.858 --> 00:46:25.203
Do me a favor.

647
00:46:25.204 --> 00:46:27.654
She pops up on any grid,
let's see where she goes.

648
00:46:27.655 --> 00:46:31.623
As for the rest, our fugitives
aren't unknown quantities.

649
00:46:31.624 --> 00:46:35.317
Toretto has a sister, a son.

650
00:46:35.318 --> 00:46:37.629
Until we find him,

651
00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:39.322
find his family.

652
00:46:58.928 --> 00:47:01.446
Oh!

653
00:47:01.447 --> 00:47:03.241
- Again.

654
00:47:03.242 --> 00:47:05.381
Wow.

655
00:47:05.382 --> 00:47:07.038
Are you cheating on-on
your favorite auntie?

656
00:47:07.039 --> 00:47:09.834
It doesn't matter if you
win by an inch or a mile.

657
00:47:09.835 --> 00:47:10.973
Winning's winning.

658
00:47:10.974 --> 00:47:12.942
Where have I heard
that one before?

659
00:47:15.289 --> 00:47:17.636
Go! Go!

660
00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:21.398
Search everywhere!
We need them alive!

661
00:47:26.438 --> 00:47:29.303
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

662
00:47:31.512 --> 00:47:33.479
No! Mia! Let her go!

663
00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:40.107
Run!

664
00:48:06.754 --> 00:48:08.755
- What's up?
- Uncle Jakob?

665
00:48:08.756 --> 00:48:09.826
Your dad sent me.

666
00:48:11.552 --> 00:48:12.656
Change of plans.

667
00:48:31.468 --> 00:48:32.882
Don't move!

668
00:48:32.883 --> 00:48:35.024
- I said don't move!

669
00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:17.066
Do you have Little B?

670
00:49:17.894 --> 00:49:19.309
B!

671
00:49:21.001 --> 00:49:23.244
- Freeze!

672
00:49:29.526 --> 00:49:30.596
- You okay?
- Yeah.

673
00:49:37.534 --> 00:49:38.708
Are you okay?

674
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:44.575
B!

675
00:49:44.576 --> 00:49:46.233
Come, come.

676
00:49:49.167 --> 00:49:51.168
Who the hell were those guys?

677
00:49:51.169 --> 00:49:54.274
Agency. Rome was a trap.
Whole family's being targeted.

678
00:49:54.275 --> 00:49:55.896
Okay, I got to get to
Brian and the kids...

679
00:49:55.897 --> 00:49:57.174
Dom sent me to take him.

680
00:49:57.175 --> 00:49:59.141
Remember that place
we said we'd go

681
00:49:59.142 --> 00:50:00.384
if the world went to hell?

682
00:50:00.385 --> 00:50:02.386
Dom wants the team
to meet there.

683
00:50:02.387 --> 00:50:03.732
Yeah.

684
00:50:03.733 --> 00:50:05.044
Okay, look.

685
00:50:05.045 --> 00:50:06.459
Little B, you're gonna
go with Uncle Jakob.

686
00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:08.771
Okay? You do whatever
he says. Yeah?

687
00:50:08.772 --> 00:50:11.637
I'm gonna get you to your
dad. If that's okay with you.

688
00:50:12.397 --> 00:50:14.744
Protect him with your life.

689
00:50:16.056 --> 00:50:17.987
I love you, Jakey.

690
00:50:17.988 --> 00:50:20.369
I love you, too, sis.

691
00:50:20.370 --> 00:50:22.131
Let's do it.

692
00:50:30.449 --> 00:50:33.763
Oh, my God.

693
00:50:36.352 --> 00:50:38.007
Yo!

694
00:50:38.008 --> 00:50:39.837
It's not that one.

695
00:50:39.838 --> 00:50:41.736
It's this one.

696
00:50:42.703 --> 00:50:44.532
Yep.

697
00:50:46.569 --> 00:50:47.741
Wait, but...

698
00:50:47.742 --> 00:50:49.537

as they can handle.

718
00:52:00.953 --> 00:52:02.438
Thanks.

719
00:52:03.508 --> 00:52:04.854
Cheers.

720
00:52:07.546 --> 00:52:10.652
Queenie told me I
could find you here.

721
00:52:10.653 --> 00:52:11.998
Belgian?

722
00:52:11.999 --> 00:52:14.207
Mr. Nobody said
he had a daughter.

723
00:52:14.208 --> 00:52:16.278
He did?

724
00:52:16.279 --> 00:52:20.179
Well, now that
he's gone missing,

725
00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:21.973
I came in from the cold.

726
00:52:21.974 --> 00:52:23.837
Your dad kept the
agency in line.

727
00:52:23.838 --> 00:52:27.289
Now it feels like all the
anchors have been cut.

728
00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:31.673
In a world where there is
no code, no one's safe.

729
00:52:31.674 --> 00:52:33.606
You're right.

730
00:52:33.607 --> 00:52:36.885
The agency has turned its back
on everything it stood for.

731
00:52:36.886 --> 00:52:40.338
The new boss, Aimes, he's
coming for you with everything.

732
00:52:41.408 --> 00:52:43.340
I'm buying you some time.

733
00:52:43.341 --> 00:52:48.518
And borrowed their, uh,
little tracking device thingy.

734
00:52:49.761 --> 00:52:51.071
Look familiar?

735
00:52:51.072 --> 00:52:52.452
God's Eye.
- Mm-hmm.

736
00:52:52.453 --> 00:52:54.143
I'd put that in a
vault somewhere.

737
00:52:54.144 --> 00:52:57.699
People pull vaults out of walls,
so I think it's safer with me.

738
00:52:57.700 --> 00:52:59.287
I pulled a screen grab

739
00:52:59.288 --> 00:53:01.116
off of a traffic cam
that they missed,

740
00:53:01.117 --> 00:53:02.807
put it in God's Eye.

741
00:53:02.808 --> 00:53:04.464
There was a hit in Rio.

742
00:53:04.465 --> 00:53:07.260
You wouldn't happen to have
any enemies in Rio, would you?

743
00:53:07.261 --> 00:53:09.607
- Reyes.
- Hernan Reyes?

744
00:53:09.608 --> 00:53:14.510
Still pretty dead, but
he has a son, Dante.

745
00:53:16.374 --> 00:53:18.340
So you're gonna have
to get me to Rio.

746
00:53:18.341 --> 00:53:21.689
That's your second
wish. You have one more.

747
00:53:22.656 --> 00:53:23.967
Letty.

748
00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:30.076
Letty's in a black site
prison off of every map.

749
00:53:30.077 --> 00:53:31.284
Then get her out.

750
00:53:31.285 --> 00:53:32.941
Nobody can.

751
00:53:32.942 --> 00:53:34.805
Nobody would.

752
00:53:34.806 --> 00:53:36.289
Dom, I'm so sorry,

753
00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:39.673
but what you're asking
me to do is impossible.

754
00:53:47.336 --> 00:53:49.579
Nothing's impossible.

755
00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:54.929
You just have to have faith.

756
00:54:05.768 --> 00:54:09.322
Sneaking us out of Rome
in a shipping container

757
00:54:09.323 --> 00:54:11.600
full of aftershave, that
was a terrible idea, Roman.

758
00:54:11.601 --> 00:54:14.603
Wait, I think I lost
my sense of smell.

759
00:54:14.604 --> 00:54:16.605
That is not aftershave.
That is tear gas.

760
00:54:16.606 --> 00:54:19.367
Hey, man, I don't know what
y'all are talking about.

761
00:54:19.368 --> 00:54:21.334
You know what I mean?

762
00:54:21.335 --> 00:54:22.887
I smell magic.

763
00:54:22.888 --> 00:54:24.268
I took a bottle for myself.

764
00:54:24.269 --> 00:54:25.959
This is all thanks to you.

765
00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:27.513
You know that, right?

766
00:54:27.514 --> 00:54:29.998
No, see, you just got to
follow my "leat" as a "leater."

767
00:54:29.999 --> 00:54:33.829
You see what I'm saying?
I'm a natural-born "leater."

768
00:54:33.830 --> 00:54:35.590
Where are we?

769
00:54:35.591 --> 00:54:37.557
I brought you back home, Ramsey.

770
00:54:37.558 --> 00:54:40.249
The city with the most amount
of surveillance cameras.

771
00:54:40.250 --> 00:54:41.631
Perfect.

772
00:54:51.469 --> 00:54:54.471
- Dad know you drive this thing?
- He should.

773
00:54:54.472 --> 00:54:55.748
I raced him in it.

774
00:54:55.749 --> 00:54:58.544
And just so you
know, in the '90s,

775
00:54:58.545 --> 00:55:01.374
if you were rolling in a 5.0,
it meant you were the man.

01:00:38.298 --> 01:00:43.543
And you were <i>fantástico,
fabuloso, o cara.</i>

887
01:00:43.544 --> 01:00:45.476
He saved the Vatican.

888
01:00:45.477 --> 01:00:46.685
Who does that?

889
01:00:46.686 --> 01:00:49.964
Seriously. The Pope? God?

890
01:00:49.965 --> 01:00:51.828
By the way, did you
see what I did there?

891
01:00:51.829 --> 01:00:53.726
The ball through the city was

892
01:00:53.727 --> 01:00:56.418
a bit of an homage
to my family's safe.

893
01:00:56.419 --> 01:00:58.421
Except it was on fire.

894
01:01:01.390 --> 01:01:03.632
You remember my father?

895
01:01:03.633 --> 01:01:06.221
- Hernan Reyes.
- Yes.

896
01:01:06.222 --> 01:01:09.569
I remember he thought he had
his foot on this city's neck.

897
01:01:09.570 --> 01:01:11.123
But you know what happened?

898
01:01:11.124 --> 01:01:13.228
I took him down.

899
01:01:13.229 --> 01:01:16.749
Let's not argue in
front of the children.

900
01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:18.475
You are absolutely right.

901
01:01:18.476 --> 01:01:21.133
My father was a horrible man,

902
01:01:21.134 --> 01:01:23.618
very bad daddy,

903
01:01:23.619 --> 01:01:25.413
but I kind of liked him.

904
01:01:25.414 --> 01:01:28.140
And you took him from me
when you stole our money

905
01:01:28.141 --> 01:01:30.694
and left us with
nothing but suffering.

906
01:01:30.695 --> 01:01:33.697
Well, that's what
I came here for.

907
01:01:33.698 --> 01:01:36.356
To end that suffering.

908
01:01:37.702 --> 01:01:39.531
Oh, and I didn't
take that money.

909
01:01:42.396 --> 01:01:44.088
I burned it.

910
01:01:44.847 --> 01:01:46.675
Uh-oh.

911
01:01:46.676 --> 01:01:49.644
Well, Brazil is mine,

912
01:01:49.645 --> 01:01:51.233
and I own this city.

913
01:01:52.648 --> 01:01:54.374
Ooh.

914
01:01:58.412 --> 01:02:00.932
You people think you
can buy everything.

915
01:02:02.934 --> 01:02:04.833
But you can't buy the streets.

916
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:11.805
We stand with Dom.

917
01:02:15.602 --> 01:02:17.361
Well, this is awkward.

918
01:02:17.362 --> 01:02:20.640
So, how about we all just
start shooting each other

919
01:02:20.641 --> 01:02:21.641
and see what happens?

920
01:02:21.642 --> 01:02:24.610
Or we race.

You guys look fantastic.

1005
01:08:29.217 --> 01:08:32.736
I know the black is very
slimming and very scary,

1006
01:08:32.737 --> 01:08:34.600
but the pastels, you
know, they're in season,

1007
01:08:34.601 --> 01:08:37.569
and I feel like it tones down
the masculinity a little bit,

1008
01:08:37.570 --> 01:08:39.709
which we all need these days.

1009
01:08:39.710 --> 01:08:42.125
Did you know...

1010
01:08:42.126 --> 01:08:43.713
Listen to me.

1011
01:08:43.714 --> 01:08:46.198
Did you know that I was
legally dead for two minutes?

1012
01:08:46.199 --> 01:08:47.544
Two minutes.

1013
01:08:47.545 --> 01:08:49.822
- Bob, pay attention.

1014
01:08:49.823 --> 01:08:51.893
And you know what I saw?

1015
01:08:51.894 --> 01:08:53.136
Nothing.

1016
01:08:53.137 --> 01:08:55.449
Not a goddamn thing.

1017
01:08:55.450 --> 01:08:59.694
But I do feel like
once he, uh...

1018
01:08:59.695 --> 01:09:02.526
cracked my skull open,
it just opened my mind.

1019
01:09:03.458 --> 01:09:05.493
Yeah, that's deep, right?

1020
01:09:05.494 --> 01:09:07.840
- You're absolutely right, Bob.

1021
01:09:07.841 --> 01:09:08.946

01:11:03.785 --> 01:11:05.372
And we got to get
ready to fight.

1064
01:11:05.373 --> 01:11:08.582
Wait, so we need guns,
artillery, tanks?

1065
01:11:08.583 --> 01:11:11.309
Yeah, but how are we gonna
get that with no money?

1066
01:11:11.310 --> 01:11:12.793
What?

1067
01:11:12.794 --> 01:11:14.173
- We've been hacked.

1068
01:11:14.174 --> 01:11:15.761
Look. Every account.

1069
01:11:15.762 --> 01:11:20.145
Every dollar we made over
the last 20 years is gone.

1070
01:11:20.146 --> 01:11:21.388
He took everything.

1071
01:11:21.389 --> 01:11:22.906
We got heisted
during our own heist.

1072
01:11:22.907 --> 01:11:24.598
- Just decrypt the... Yeah.
- Decrypt the blockchain.

1073
01:11:24.599 --> 01:11:26.565
I'm on it. Then we can
find the transaction hash.

1074
01:11:26.566 --> 01:11:27.808
The transaction hash.

1075
01:11:27.809 --> 01:11:28.809
Gets us the receiving
IPs. Exactly.

1076
01:11:28.810 --> 01:11:29.913
English.

1077
01:11:29.914 --> 01:11:31.190
Following our money, genius.

1078
01:11:31.191 --> 01:11:32.399
We're trying to see
where he sent it.

1079
01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:33.676
The coding is next-level.

1080
01:11:33.677 --> 01:11:35.954
I've never seen
anything like this.

1081
01:11:35.955 --> 01:11:38.336
We need more computing power.

1082
01:11:38.337 --> 01:11:40.061
How are we gonna do
that if we broke?

1083
01:11:40.062 --> 01:11:42.617
What do you mean, "we" broke?

1084
01:11:45.067 --> 01:11:47.379
Wait, you holding out on us?

1085
01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:48.898
No wonder you've been so calm.

1086
01:11:48.899 --> 01:11:52.004
Bro, what-what d... What
do you think this is, bro?

1087
01:11:52.005 --> 01:11:54.110
You know what? Turn around.

1088
01:11:54.111 --> 01:11:55.214
"Turn around"? What do you...

1089
01:11:55.215 --> 01:11:56.526
What you mean, "turn around"?

1090
01:11:56.527 --> 01:11:58.633
Man, I'm a grown-ass...

1091
01:11:59.806 --> 01:12:02.602
- What... N... What are you
doing? Hey, Roman, do not.

1092
01:12:03.603 --> 01:12:07.192
Please tell me you're
not wearing Spanx.

1093
01:12:07.193 --> 01:12:09.401
Oh, this ain't
Spanx. These banks.

1094
01:12:09.402 --> 01:12:11.403
But it's okay, bro. I got you.

1095
01:12:11.404 --> 01:12:12.715
All right?

1096
01:12:12.716 --> 01:12:15.408
You know what I mean?

1097
01:12:18.446 --> 01:12:20.032
Yeah. That's for you.

1098
01:12:20.033 --> 01:12:22.000
That's for you.

1099
01:12:22.001 --> 01:12:23.242
Let me see.

1100
01:12:23.243 --> 01:12:25.659
Han, you always
good for the bag,

1101
01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:28.800
'cause the bag always
come back, you know.

1102
01:12:28.801 --> 01:12:32.735
So what I need from all
of y'all, I need receipts.

1103
01:12:32.736 --> 01:12:35.670
Who is you talking
to? Got your receipt.

1104
01:12:36.291 --> 01:12:39.812
So where do we go to
shop off the grid?

1105
01:12:41.054 --> 01:12:42.435
I know a place.

1106
01:12:58.347 --> 01:13:01.626
Wait. The agency's after us.
Aren't they gonna see our faces?

1107
01:13:01.627 --> 01:13:03.248
Yeah, I'm counting on it.

1108
01:13:03.249 --> 01:13:04.663
The first rule of tradecraft:

1109
01:13:04.664 --> 01:13:06.596
you can't lose a tail
if they don't find you.

1110
01:13:06.597 --> 01:13:07.977
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

1111
01:13:07.978 --> 01:13:09.461
I'll just... Wait. You
know what, I'm just...

1112
01:13:09.462 --> 01:13:10.566
We'll just... If
you want to, uh, go.

1113
01:13:10.567 --> 01:13:12.050
Uh, we'll stay here.

1114
01:13:12.051 --> 01:13:13.431
- You guys, you guys go around.
- Go around? Great.

1115
01:13:13.432 --> 01:13:15.192
Go around.

1116
01:13:19.955 --> 01:13:21.956
<i>Sir, we just got a hit
on the boy and his uncle.</i>

1117
01:13:21.957 --> 01:13:23.613
The rest of the team
is still in Europe.

1118
01:13:23.614 --> 01:13:24.787
We're interfacing with
local authorities.

1119
01:13:24.788 --> 01:13:26.374
Forget authorities.

1120
01:13:26.375 --> 01:13:27.652
These people have been
outrunning the cops

1121
01:13:27.653 --> 01:13:28.929
since they could
reach the gas pedal.

1122
01:13:28.930 --> 01:13:30.793
Get word to every
snitch, smuggler,

1123
01:13:30.794 --> 01:13:32.173
hitter and hacker
we've ever used.

1124
01:13:32.174 --> 01:13:34.762
Money talks and so will they.

1125
01:13:34.763 --> 01:13:36.350
- We're getting an alert

1126
01:13:36.351 --> 01:13:37.351
on Black Site A.

1127
01:13:37.352 --> 01:13:39.664
Tess just visited Ortiz.

1128
01:13:39.665 --> 01:13:41.252
They have a nice chat?

1129
01:13:42.219 --> 01:13:44.013
Guess not.

1130
01:13:44.014 --> 01:13:46.706
Run it back for me.

1131
01:13:48.984 --> 01:13:50.814
Stop. Zoom in.

1132
01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:54.368
Back-trace her flight path.

1133
01:13:54.369 --> 01:13:56.025
Find out where she
was before this.

1134
01:13:56.026 --> 01:13:57.821
That's where Dom is.

1135
01:14:12.905 --> 01:14:15.527
You knew who I was
all along, didn't you?

1136
01:14:15.528 --> 01:14:17.356
From the moment I saw you.

1137
01:14:17.357 --> 01:14:22.121
Your sister smiled with her
eyes and led with her heart.

1138
01:14:24.054 --> 01:14:26.159
Just like you do.

1139
01:14:27.436 --> 01:14:29.092
We were nothing alike.

1140
01:14:29.093 --> 01:14:31.612
She was the good sister.

1141
01:14:31.613 --> 01:14:33.614
Always putting others first.

1142
01:14:33.615 --> 01:14:35.997
Always doing what was right.

1143
01:14:38.827 --> 01:14:41.968
Sometimes I would think
that the wrong sister died.

1144
01:14:43.245 --> 01:14:45.316
Why the good one and not me?

1145
01:14:55.672 --> 01:14:59.364
You're wrong about not
being anything like her.

1146
01:14:59.365 --> 01:15:02.230
You think that's what
she wants to hear?

1147
01:15:04.543 --> 01:15:07.130
A cop and a street racer.

1148
01:15:07.131 --> 01:15:08.994
I'll tell you something.

1149
01:15:08.995 --> 01:15:12.136
They travel down the
same road long enough...

1150
01:15:13.897 --> 01:15:17.590
and they realize how much
alike they really are.

1151
01:15:19.523 --> 01:15:21.629
Trust me...

1152
01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:25.218
I know.

1153
01:15:33.641 --> 01:15:36.229
She's still doing it, isn't she?

1154
01:15:39.957 --> 01:15:42.270
She's still helping people.

1155
01:15:46.308 --> 01:15:48.276
She's helping us.

1156
01:15:49.518 --> 01:15:51.865
You know, Elena,

1157
01:15:51.866 --> 01:15:54.315
she knew everything
about the Reyes family.

1158
01:15:54.316 --> 01:15:55.972
After they killed her husband,

1159
01:15:55.973 --> 01:15:58.768
she dedicated her life
trying to take them down.

1160
01:15:58.769 --> 01:16:02.221
I think I still have her files.

1161
01:16:03.222 --> 01:16:06.155
<i>Wait, so we gonna find
military-grade gear</i>

1162
01:16:06.156 --> 01:16:07.639
<i>in the middle of London?</i>

1163
01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:09.262
You said you wanted
to shop off the grid.

1164
01:16:12.956 --> 01:16:16.130
Wait a second. Did
we just time-travel?

1165
01:16:16.131 --> 01:16:18.512
Would you look for a
black-market operation

1166
01:16:18.513 --> 01:16:20.135
in a place like this?

1167
01:16:21.896 --> 01:16:23.172
You've got mail.

1168
01:16:23.173 --> 01:16:25.278
- Ooh, snacks.
- Get me a receipt, homey.

1169
01:16:26.383 --> 01:16:29.557
How am I gonna get a receipt
from a vending machine?

1170
01:16:29.558 --> 01:16:30.938
How about you figure it out?

1171
01:16:30.939 --> 01:16:33.631
Paper trail, bruh.
For tax write-off.

1172
01:16:33.632 --> 01:16:35.047
I swear to God...

1173
01:16:36.635 --> 01:16:38.152
What's up, Bowie420?

1174
01:16:38.153 --> 01:16:40.708
Oh, shit. FreddieMerc?

1175
01:16:41.743 --> 01:16:44.504
What? I had a life
before you knew me.

1176
01:16:45.816 --> 01:16:47.403
Bowie here runs one
of the most notorious

1177
01:16:47.404 --> 01:16:49.025
online black markets.

1178
01:16:49.026 --> 01:16:51.027
If you want it, he'll sell it.

1179
01:16:51.028 --> 01:16:52.615
I thought you didn't like
that about me, though.

1180
01:16:52.616 --> 01:16:54.030
Well, desperate times.

1181
01:16:54.031 --> 01:16:55.583
What kind of muffins are these?

1182
01:16:55.584 --> 01:16:56.723
Oh, those are fun muffins.

1183
01:16:56.724 --> 01:16:58.241
You have like four of them,

1184
01:16:58.242 --> 01:16:59.898
you'll be in your underwear
watching <i>Fantasia.</i>

1185
01:16:59.899 --> 01:17:01.141
Is that what you guys
came for? My muffins?

1186
01:17:01.142 --> 01:17:02.799
Oh, it's gonna be
a muffin party?

1187
01:17:04.076 --> 01:17:06.318
We, uh, we need transport.

1188
01:17:06.319 --> 01:17:08.493
Weapons, cars, the works.

1189
01:17:08.494 --> 01:17:09.908
And quietly.

1190
01:17:09.909 --> 01:17:11.634
Cool, then I'm just
gonna need cash. Okay?

1191
01:17:11.635 --> 01:17:12.980
None of that crypto stuff.

1192
01:17:12.981 --> 01:17:15.086
Oh, the Black Jeff Bezos
here got you covered.

1193
01:17:15.087 --> 01:17:17.778
Black Bezos?
-Yeah, he's even been into outer space.

1194
01:17:17.779 --> 01:17:19.918
Wow.
-If y'all was gonna be giving out my money,

1195
01:17:19.919 --> 01:17:21.920
I'd appreciate some
type of a heads-up,

1196
01:17:21.921 --> 01:17:23.370
you know what I'm saying?

1197
01:17:23.371 --> 01:17:25.406
How much we talking about, bruh?

1198
01:17:25.407 --> 01:17:26.961
Just like a reasonable amount.

1199
01:17:27.513 --> 01:17:29.446
How about that?

1200
01:17:30.965 --> 01:17:32.482
That won't even
cover the muffins.

1201
01:17:32.483 --> 01:17:33.725
Is this guy serious?

1202
01:17:33.726 --> 01:17:35.727
Shit's crazy. Mm-kay.

1203
01:17:35.728 --> 01:17:37.903
Come on, man,
you're an astronaut.

1204
01:17:39.145 --> 01:17:41.250
Well, how about that?

1205
01:17:41.251 --> 01:17:42.838
What, did you leave all
your money in space?

1206
01:17:42.839 --> 01:17:44.736
Man, give me this.

1207
01:17:44.737 --> 01:17:46.393
- Thank you.
- Are you serious right now?

1208
01:17:46.394 --> 01:17:48.775
You know I pay for everything
around here, right?

1209
01:17:48.776 --> 01:17:50.604
You should pay for everything.

1210
01:17:50.605 --> 01:17:53.849
It's your mission in Rome that
got us here in the first place.

1211
01:17:53.850 --> 01:17:56.265
No, it was your intel
that led us to Rome.

1212
01:17:56.266 --> 01:17:58.474
To be fair, that setup would
have confused the best of us.

1213
01:17:58.475 --> 01:17:59.717
No, I'm tired of this.

1214
01:17:59.718 --> 01:18:01.132
'Cause all he do is talk.

1215
01:18:01.133 --> 01:18:03.513
And then everyone has to
do their job and yours.

1216
01:18:03.514 --> 01:18:04.860
What are you saying, Tej?

1217
01:18:04.861 --> 01:18:06.413
- Mean, what I'm
saying? Hey, guys.

1218
01:18:06.414 --> 01:18:08.622
- This is a family environment.
- What? Really?

1219
01:18:08.623 --> 01:18:10.520
- Really? Take it
outside, fellas.

1220
01:18:10.521 --> 01:18:13.213
So, what we doing, bruh?

1221
01:18:13.214 --> 01:18:14.455
Uh-oh.

1222
01:18:14.456 --> 01:18:17.149
- Gentlemen, please! Guys!

1223
01:18:18.391 --> 01:18:20.461
Oh, not the vending machine. No.
-WOMAN: Unbelievable.

1224
01:18:20.462 --> 01:18:23.568
Guys, you're causing like
dozens of dollars in damage!

1225
01:18:23.569 --> 01:18:25.397
Let's go. Come on.

1226
01:18:25.398 --> 01:18:27.435
Should we stop this?

1227
01:18:28.747 --> 01:18:31.888
Hold on!
- Nah, let 'em bond.

1228
01:18:32.716 --> 01:18:35.167
Hey! That computer's
from, like, '98!

1229
01:18:36.237 --> 01:18:37.928
Huh?

1230
01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:41.863
BOWIE [echoing]:
What the hell, man?

1231
01:18:52.425 --> 01:18:54.495
Okay. All right.

1232
01:18:54.496 --> 01:18:55.807
We doing stomachs now.

1233
01:18:55.808 --> 01:18:57.360
All right, all
right, that's enough.

1234
01:18:57.361 --> 01:18:59.017
You've been wanting that for years!
-BOWIE: Uh, I think

1235
01:18:59.018 --> 01:19:01.193
he hit the copy machine
so hard it works now.

1236
01:19:05.542 --> 01:19:06.956
What the hell was that?

1237
01:19:06.957 --> 01:19:08.095
He's like a ghetto magician.

1238
01:19:08.096 --> 01:19:10.132
You know what it is, bruh.

1239
01:19:10.133 --> 01:19:12.375
- I beat your ass.
- You just beat my ass?

1240
01:19:12.376 --> 01:19:13.652
- Beat my ass, huh?
- My God,

1241
01:19:13.653 --> 01:19:14.930
will you two just
quit it? Please.

1242
01:19:14.931 --> 01:19:16.897
We don't have time
for this. You.

1243
01:19:16.898 --> 01:19:18.485
- Get to work.
- Oh, I just need

1244
01:19:18.486 --> 01:19:20.521
to hack into the marketplace.
It'll just take a second.

1245
01:19:20.522 --> 01:19:22.730
Oops.

1246
01:19:22.731 --> 01:19:24.560
What the hell, Bowie?
What did you just do?

1247
01:19:24.561 --> 01:19:25.872
I'm sorry. Your
guys's faces are,

1248
01:19:25.873 --> 01:19:27.632
like, all over the dark web.

1249
01:19:27.633 --> 01:19:29.289
I mean, that reward is dope.

1250
01:19:29.290 --> 01:19:31.118
- Ow. Hey.
- We have to move.

1251
01:19:31.119 --> 01:19:33.707
- The agency's minutes away.
- Look, it's nothing personal.

1252
01:19:33.708 --> 01:19:35.951
- Hey, fun muffins on me, okay?
- What? Huh?

1253
01:19:35.952 --> 01:19:37.021
- Oh! Oh!

1254
01:19:37.022 --> 01:19:39.230
I deserved that.

1255
01:19:39.231 --> 01:19:41.854
- Are you okay, bro?
- Yeah, thank you, man.

1256
01:19:47.170 --> 01:19:48.860
All right, so where to now, huh?

1257
01:19:48.861 --> 01:19:50.137
- Jail?

1258
01:19:50.138 --> 01:19:53.486
I know somewhere. Last
place I want to go.

1259
01:20:19.029 --> 01:20:21.824
How does it feel to be
on my side of the law?

1260
01:20:21.825 --> 01:20:24.689
They like to fix things
before they break 'em.

1261
01:20:24.690 --> 01:20:27.382
It's a sick place, Letty.

1262
01:20:30.523 --> 01:20:32.214
You're welcome.

1263
01:20:32.215 --> 01:20:33.560
What did you do?

1264
01:20:33.561 --> 01:20:36.666
I rerouted anesthetic gas
into their air conditioning.

1265
01:20:36.667 --> 01:20:40.153
And I bought us a few minutes
before these cameras reset

1266
01:20:40.154 --> 01:20:43.088
and they find out this place
turned into a sleep study.

1267
01:20:47.299 --> 01:20:50.474
You gonna stay grumpy or do
you want to get out of here?

1268
01:20:51.544 --> 01:20:53.994
They're not gonna sleep forever.

1269
01:20:53.995 --> 01:20:56.895
Don't you want to get back
to your precious family?

1270
01:20:58.103 --> 01:21:00.036
Shit.

1271
01:21:02.797 --> 01:21:04.763
Seems like you got this covered.

1272
01:21:04.764 --> 01:21:06.558
- What do you need me for?
- I have a plan,

1273
01:21:06.559 --> 01:21:09.148
but it's a two-person job.

1274
01:21:17.985 --> 01:21:19.641
Now, was that so hard?

1275
01:21:20.539 --> 01:21:22.643
How much time do we have?

1276
01:21:22.644 --> 01:21:24.749
I'd say about four minutes.

1277
01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:25.923
It'll have to do.

01:21:25.924 --> 01:21:27.614

You got to hit me
harder for that.

1284
01:21:43.044 --> 01:21:44.873

1302
01:23:12.927 --> 01:23:16.068
Dante Reyes.

1303
01:23:17.207 --> 01:23:19.070
Born in Portugal.

1304
01:23:19.071 --> 01:23:22.039
Mother from the Pacific Islands.

1305
01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:25.042
Sociopathic tendencies
from an early age.

1306
01:23:25.043 --> 01:23:28.183
He bounced from juvie to
prison to mental wards.

1307
01:23:28.184 --> 01:23:30.564
And each time, Daddy was
there to spring him out.

1308
01:23:30.565 --> 01:23:34.292
After his father
died, he disappeared.

1309
01:23:34.293 --> 01:23:38.917
Properties Reyes
owned before he died.

1310
01:23:38.918 --> 01:23:41.541
Now all sold and repo'd.

1311
01:23:41.542 --> 01:23:43.199
Except this one.

1312
01:23:44.717 --> 01:23:46.891
The police station.

1313
01:23:46.892 --> 01:23:49.135
It's been abandoned for years.

1314
01:23:49.136 --> 01:23:51.517
And guess whose
name is on the deed.

1315
01:23:52.967 --> 01:23:54.589
Dante Reyes.

1316
01:23:55.659 --> 01:23:57.075
I'll find my answer there.

1317
01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:01.734
I'm coming with you.

1318
01:24:04.254 --> 01:24:07.257
I need you to stay safe.

1319
01:24:12.504 --> 01:24:15.265
I would have won
that race, you know.

1320
01:24:16.059 --> 01:24:17.439
So you want a rematch?

1321
01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:19.958
- I'm demanding it.

1322
01:24:19.959 --> 01:24:22.686
So I guess I'll see you soon.

1323
01:24:54.235 --> 01:24:56.857
Guys, you don't want to do this.

1324
01:24:56.858 --> 01:24:59.066
He needs a new watch, cop.

1325
01:24:59.067 --> 01:25:00.585
Look, the watch was a gift.

1326
01:25:00.586 --> 01:25:03.140
But I got 16 carats of uncut
diamonds in my jockstrap

1327
01:25:03.141 --> 01:25:04.866
if you want to take a look.

1328
01:25:14.945 --> 01:25:17.845
Now you really do
need a new watch.

1329
01:25:23.091 --> 01:25:24.748
Damn it.

1330
01:25:34.586 --> 01:25:35.725
B, you okay?

1331
01:25:37.727 --> 01:25:39.210
Tried gum? Gum helps.

1332
01:25:39.211 --> 01:25:41.557
I don't like planes.

1333
01:25:41.558 --> 01:25:44.458
If it's the height,
that's gonna be an issue.

1334
01:25:45.424 --> 01:25:47.909
You know, I used to
be scared of cars.

1335
01:25:48.807 --> 01:25:52.672
After my dad died, I
guess I blamed myself.

1336
01:25:52.673 --> 01:25:53.707
It was tough.

1337
01:25:53.708 --> 01:25:56.227
I had panic attacks,
the whole bit.

1338
01:25:56.228 --> 01:25:57.746
Heck, I took the bus.

1339
01:25:57.747 --> 01:26:00.645
Yeah. I think I was just so
worried about making mistakes

1340
01:26:00.646 --> 01:26:03.855
and not being as
good as my brother.

1341
01:26:03.856 --> 01:26:05.305
- You?
- Uh, excuse me.

1342
01:26:05.306 --> 01:26:07.134
Have you met your dad?

1343
01:26:07.135 --> 01:26:09.137
He casts a pretty big shadow.

1344
01:26:12.002 --> 01:26:14.728
Huh. Feeling better?

1345
01:26:14.729 --> 01:26:15.867
- Yeah.
- Good.

1346
01:26:15.868 --> 01:26:17.698
Me, too.

1347
01:26:21.736 --> 01:26:25.430
Here's the drink that
you ordered, sir.

1348
01:26:27.915 --> 01:26:29.743
You know her?

1349
01:26:29.744 --> 01:26:32.884
Yeah, it's good to have
friends in high places.

1350
01:26:32.885 --> 01:26:34.610
On the count of three,

1351
01:26:34.611 --> 01:26:37.234
we're gonna get up and go
to the bathroom. Ready?

1352
01:26:37.235 --> 01:26:39.547
- Three.

1353
01:27:14.375 --> 01:27:15.789
Who were those guys?

1354
01:27:15.790 --> 01:27:18.517
Agency. They found us.
Now let's lose our tail.

1355
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:28.733
Holy shi...

1356
01:27:28.734 --> 01:27:33.186
Wait! Swearing is for song
lyrics only and stubbed toes.

1357
01:27:33.187 --> 01:27:34.601
Forget about it. Pay attention.

1358
01:27:34.602 --> 01:27:37.017
Okay? We're-we're
too high to glide,

1359
01:27:37.018 --> 01:27:40.227
so we need thrust,
which means, uh,

1360
01:27:40.228 --> 01:27:42.507
combustion, which means...?

1361
01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:47.304
Oxygen and fuel.

1362
01:27:47.305 --> 01:27:48.374
Alcohol.

1363
01:27:48.375 --> 01:27:49.789
- Um...
- Huh?

1364
01:27:49.790 --> 01:27:51.032
Oh.

1365
01:27:58.281 --> 01:27:59.695
That's rosé. Not gonna work.

1366
01:27:59.696 --> 01:28:01.526
Long story. But
good initiative.

1367
01:28:12.295 --> 01:28:14.261
I'm glad it wasn't the height.

1368
01:28:14.262 --> 01:28:15.919
Enjoy the ride, Little B.

1369
01:28:28.449 --> 01:28:30.139
Bowie tagged us.

1370
01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:31.417
The agency is on our tail.

1371
01:28:31.418 --> 01:28:32.797
We need to find gear

1372
01:28:32.798 --> 01:28:34.972
and get to the rendezvous
as soon as possible.

1373
01:28:34.973 --> 01:28:36.250
It's right here.

1374
01:28:37.113 --> 01:28:39.494
You guys hold back. Let
me take care of this.

1375
01:28:39.495 --> 01:28:41.703
No, no, no.
Th-That's a bad idea.

1376
01:28:41.704 --> 01:28:44.395
- I mean like Roman-level bad.
- What?

1377
01:28:44.396 --> 01:28:45.465
What are you talking about, man?

1378
01:28:45.466 --> 01:28:46.915
You heard what I said.

1379
01:28:46.916 --> 01:28:49.089
Look, bro, you don't
have to do this, man.

1380
01:28:49.090 --> 01:28:50.746
You know I got your back.

1381
01:28:50.747 --> 01:28:51.852
We got your back.

1382
01:28:55.062 --> 01:28:57.478
- I got to do this alone.

1383
01:29:16.255 --> 01:29:18.602
I have something to
talk to you about.

1384
01:29:18.603 --> 01:29:22.157
The only reason a dead
guy shows up at my door:

1385
01:29:22.158 --> 01:29:23.435
revenge.

1386
01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:29.165
Oh, shi...

1387
01:29:32.444 --> 01:29:34.860
- Oh, shit.
- Shit. Han!

1388
01:29:36.172 --> 01:29:38.311
Should have stayed dead.

1389
01:29:38.312 --> 01:29:40.141
I can get in. I can get in.

1390
01:29:41.073 --> 01:29:42.591
I don't like repeating myself.

1391
01:29:42.592 --> 01:29:45.008
You ruined my snacks.

1392
01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:51.738
Relax. I don't
want to fight you.

1393
01:29:51.739 --> 01:29:53.845
Then this is gonna end quick.

1394
01:30:31.123 --> 01:30:32.469
You bring more men to kill me?

1395
01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:34.437
They're trying to kill me, too.

1396
01:30:35.127 --> 01:30:37.577
Well, it looks like
we got more company.

1397
01:30:37.578 --> 01:30:40.236
- You still drive?
- What do you think?

1398
01:30:43.446 --> 01:30:45.620
Okay, just give me a second.

1399
01:30:45.621 --> 01:30:46.932
Freeze!

1400
01:31:10.197 --> 01:31:12.061
- Drop the laptop!
- Okay.

1401
01:31:38.225 --> 01:31:39.606
- Guys, I'm in.

1402
01:31:51.376 --> 01:31:52.791
No, no, no, no!

1403
01:31:57.106 --> 01:31:58.521
Now we're even.

1404
01:32:05.321 --> 01:32:06.356
You okay?

1405
01:32:20.923 --> 01:32:24.650
Now, see, I understand all this.

1406
01:32:24.651 --> 01:32:26.100
What the hell was that?

1407
01:32:31.278 --> 01:32:33.037
You got scared. I saw that.

1408
01:32:33.038 --> 01:32:36.076
- Ain't nobody got scared, bruh.
- No, you were... he was scared.

1409
01:32:51.643 --> 01:32:52.816
LETTY [over speakers]: We
have an unwanted guest.

1410
01:32:52.817 --> 01:32:53.989
DOM [over speakers]:
My family?

1411
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:55.646
They're safe for now.

1412
01:32:55.647 --> 01:32:56.751
You're not afraid of anything.

1413
01:32:56.752 --> 01:32:58.338
I don't care about dying.

1414
01:32:58.339 --> 01:33:01.445
I only care about protecting
the people that I love.

1415
01:33:01.446 --> 01:33:02.619
Hold us in your heart

1416
01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:04.206
and you will never
lose your way.

1417
01:33:04.207 --> 01:33:05.622
You're not afraid of anything.

1418
01:33:05.623 --> 01:33:07.209
Fear can be a great teacher.

1419
01:33:07.210 --> 01:33:09.410
LITTLE BRIAN [distorted]:
You're not afraid of anything.

1420
01:33:23.123 --> 01:33:24.917
DANTE [over phone]: How
do you like my place?

1421
01:33:24.918 --> 01:33:28.299
I'm bummed I'm not there
to show you around.

1422
01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:30.682
And a little embarrassed
you saw my vision board.

1423
01:33:32.166 --> 01:33:34.133
But at least you know how
hard I've been working

1424
01:33:34.134 --> 01:33:35.479
to get us to this point.

1425
01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:37.239
Now I know you're a dead man.

1426
01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:38.551
You mean resurrected.

1427
01:33:38.552 --> 01:33:40.208
Thanks to you.

1428
01:33:40.209 --> 01:33:41.934
You know, if you never would
have gotten behind that wheel,

1429
01:33:41.935 --> 01:33:44.799
I'd never be the
man that I am today.

1430
01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:46.835
You built such a beautiful life,

1431
01:33:46.836 --> 01:33:49.873
filled with love and family.

1432
01:33:49.874 --> 01:33:51.633
I never got that chance.

1433
01:33:51.634 --> 01:33:55.602
Collateral damage, chaos, death.

1434
01:33:55.603 --> 01:33:57.087
This is your legacy.

1435
01:33:57.088 --> 01:33:58.433
I'm your legacy.

1436
01:33:58.434 --> 01:34:00.193
You know what I
can't figure out?

1437
01:34:00.194 --> 01:34:04.128
How someone born so rich

1438
01:34:04.129 --> 01:34:07.718
chooses the poorest
path through life.

1439
01:34:07.719 --> 01:34:09.547
You got no honor.

1440
01:34:09.548 --> 01:34:13.242
Without honor,
you got no family.

1441
01:34:14.519 --> 01:34:16.279
And without family...

1442
01:34:18.454 --> 01:34:20.489
you've got nothing.

1443
01:34:20.490 --> 01:34:22.457
I have nothing because of you.

1444
01:34:22.458 --> 01:34:24.908
My future. My family.

1445
01:34:24.909 --> 01:34:27.600
You stole that from me.

1446
01:34:27.601 --> 01:34:30.361
And now I'm gonna break yours,

1447
01:34:30.362 --> 01:34:32.950
piece by piece.

1448
01:34:32.951 --> 01:34:35.435
Stop talking and face me.

1449
01:34:35.436 --> 01:34:36.885
Do you like surprises, Dommy?

1450
01:34:36.886 --> 01:34:39.717
I adore them.

1451
01:34:41.408 --> 01:34:42.926
But the game's not over yet.

1452
01:34:42.927 --> 01:34:45.239
There's still so
many people to hurt.

1453
01:34:47.966 --> 01:34:49.898
I'm coming for you.

1454
01:34:49.899 --> 01:34:52.245
Well, that's gonna be
hard to do in handcuffs.

1455
01:34:52.246 --> 01:34:54.420
Okay, bye, Dommy.

1456
01:34:54.421 --> 01:34:56.318
No, you hang up first.

1457
01:34:56.319 --> 01:34:57.493
Okay.

1458
01:35:07.814 --> 01:35:09.055
Toretto, freeze.

1459
01:35:09.056 --> 01:35:11.851
Time to face the music, Dom.

1460
01:35:11.852 --> 01:35:14.372
You're playing right
into his hands, cop.

1461
01:35:50.063 --> 01:35:53.238
Okay. Come on.

1462
01:35:55.206 --> 01:35:56.897
Oh.

1463
01:35:59.831 --> 01:36:01.384
Yeah.

1464
01:36:11.670 --> 01:36:13.844
Great.

1465
01:36:13.845 --> 01:36:16.157
Just great.

1466
01:36:16.158 --> 01:36:17.987
Shit.

1467
01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:27.065
Little chilly?

1468
01:36:28.549 --> 01:36:29.860
Your plan still sucks.

1469
01:36:29.861 --> 01:36:32.588
Maybe, but at least
you'll be warm.

1470
01:36:33.658 --> 01:36:36.557
"Thank you, Cipher. Thank you."

1471
01:36:45.394 --> 01:36:46.497
- Oh, wow.

1472
01:36:46.498 --> 01:36:47.878
Take a look at this.

1473
01:36:47.879 --> 01:36:49.707
This should cover us
in the gear department.

1474
01:36:49.708 --> 01:36:51.399
You are not to be trusted.

1475
01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:55.197
Hey, you ain't on my
Christmas list either.

1476
01:36:57.233 --> 01:36:59.786
Nothing here is for free.
Let me be clear on that.

1477
01:36:59.787 --> 01:37:01.547
Make sure you get a
receipt from him, okay?

1478
01:37:01.548 --> 01:37:02.893
I'd love to see that.

1479
01:37:02.894 --> 01:37:04.550
Well, I guess Bowie

1480
01:37:04.551 --> 01:37:06.690
wasn't entirely worthless.
I can use his hard drive

1481
01:37:06.691 --> 01:37:08.105
to complete our trace of Dante.

1482
01:37:08.106 --> 01:37:10.625
He's been ten moves ahead
of us this whole time.

1483
01:37:10.626 --> 01:37:12.075
How does he do it by himself?

1484
01:37:12.076 --> 01:37:13.766
Uh, this isn't good.

1485
01:37:13.767 --> 01:37:16.113
Our money, it's been split into
accounts all over the world.

1486
01:37:16.114 --> 01:37:18.288
And look who they're
registered to.

1487
01:37:18.289 --> 01:37:20.980
Those are mercenary
kill teams. Real scum.

1488
01:37:20.981 --> 01:37:22.809
He used our money
to buy an army.

1489
01:37:22.810 --> 01:37:24.811
So this guy doesn't
just want us dead.

1490
01:37:24.812 --> 01:37:26.123
He wants to erase
us off the planet.

1491
01:37:26.124 --> 01:37:27.607
He's trying to tear us apart.

1492
01:37:27.608 --> 01:37:29.678
That's exactly why we need
to link back up with Dom

1493
01:37:29.679 --> 01:37:31.889
at the rendezvous point.

1494
01:37:35.099 --> 01:37:36.686
You need to see this.

1495
01:37:38.757 --> 01:37:40.413
They've been paid to target us

1496
01:37:40.414 --> 01:37:43.935
and anyone who ever
helped us until now.

1497
01:37:46.696 --> 01:37:48.250
Mum.

1498
01:38:10.824 --> 01:38:12.998
I'll have transport
waiting for you.

1499
01:38:12.999 --> 01:38:15.241
And where are you going?

1500
01:38:15.242 --> 01:38:17.037
I'm gonna dig some graves.

1501
01:38:27.806 --> 01:38:29.428
<i>Mr. Nobody's golden boy,</i>

1502
01:38:29.429 --> 01:38:31.602
<i>caught without so
much as a fight.</i>

1503
01:38:31.603 --> 01:38:33.259
That's no fun.

1504
01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:35.123
It's like going all
the way to Everest

1505
01:38:35.124 --> 01:38:36.919
and taking the elevator.

1506
01:38:38.610 --> 01:38:40.025
You might want to buckle up.

1507
01:38:40.026 --> 01:38:43.200
I know you did some good
work for the agency.

1508
01:38:43.201 --> 01:38:46.065
I'm sure you figured that
buys you some leniency.

1509
01:38:46.066 --> 01:38:48.136
But it's a new day.

1510
01:38:48.137 --> 01:38:51.485
That's the problem
nowadays. Nobody listens.

1511
01:38:54.868 --> 01:38:57.525
You should have spent less time
with your head under the hood

1512
01:38:57.526 --> 01:38:59.941
and more time preparing
for what's coming.

1513
01:38:59.942 --> 01:39:02.461
Spies have been
replaced by satellites,

1514
01:39:02.462 --> 01:39:07.397
fighter pilots by drones,
intelligence by an algorithm.

1515
01:39:07.398 --> 01:39:10.158
The days where one man
behind the wheel of a car

1516
01:39:10.159 --> 01:39:13.023
can make a difference
are over, Dom.

1517
01:39:13.024 --> 01:39:15.819
Hell, the days of any man

1518
01:39:15.820 --> 01:39:17.787
behind the wheel
of a car are over.

1519
01:39:21.032 --> 01:39:22.101
What are you doing?

1520
01:39:22.102 --> 01:39:24.724
Preparing for what's to come.

1521
01:39:24.725 --> 01:39:26.658
Right.

1522
01:39:44.504 --> 01:39:45.643
Go. Go. Go.

1523
01:40:02.625 --> 01:40:06.904
Dominic, I brought you
back to where we first met.

1524
01:40:06.905 --> 01:40:08.631
And I have a surprise for you.

1525
01:40:35.072 --> 01:40:36.314
Dom!

1526
01:40:37.522 --> 01:40:39.524
I'm listening now.

1527
01:41:13.662 --> 01:41:14.869
Dominic?

1528
01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:16.181
Dominic!

1529
01:41:16.182 --> 01:41:18.044
Would you stop hurting
my new friends?

1530
01:41:18.045 --> 01:41:20.668
No. I'm only here to hurt you.

1531
01:41:20.669 --> 01:41:21.703
Oh.

1532
01:41:21.704 --> 01:41:24.258
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1533
01:41:24.259 --> 01:41:25.914
That little car
stunt you just did?

1534
01:41:25.915 --> 01:41:26.984
That was pretty awesome.

1535
01:41:26.985 --> 01:41:28.227
Wasn't it?

1536
01:41:28.228 --> 01:41:29.573
It was so cool.

1537
01:41:29.574 --> 01:41:31.782
But if you don't stop,

1538
01:41:31.783 --> 01:41:34.889
I'm gonna cut her everywhere.

1539
01:41:34.890 --> 01:41:36.374
Badly.

1540
01:41:41.759 --> 01:41:43.380
There she is.

1541
01:41:43.381 --> 01:41:45.866
- Hmm.
- Fashionably late.

1542
01:41:46.798 --> 01:41:48.214
You got me.

1543
01:41:49.111 --> 01:41:51.077
Mmm.

1544
01:41:51.078 --> 01:41:53.495
- Off you go.

1545
01:41:54.944 --> 01:41:56.843
Family.

1546
01:41:59.190 --> 01:42:02.159
Will you please get off my car?

1547
01:42:04.126 --> 01:42:05.816
- Hmm.

1548
01:42:05.817 --> 01:42:07.646
That is so disrespectful.

1549
01:42:07.647 --> 01:42:09.442
You talk too much.

1550
01:42:23.249 --> 01:42:24.421
Stop, stop!

1551
01:42:24.422 --> 01:42:25.906
You don't know
your own strength.

1552
01:42:29.841 --> 01:42:31.359
You butthole!

1553
01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:33.535
Oh, hey.

1554
01:42:34.743 --> 01:42:36.744
Do you like ballet?

1555
01:42:36.745 --> 01:42:38.366
I adore <i>Swan Lake.</i>

1556
01:42:38.367 --> 01:42:40.265
I feel like you're more of
a... Kind of a <i>Nutcracker</i> guy.

1557
01:42:40.266 --> 01:42:43.372
And a one, and a two, and...

1558
01:42:45.167 --> 01:42:46.789
No!

1559
01:42:53.002 --> 01:42:54.521
Wait for it.

1560
01:42:57.144 --> 01:42:58.697
Oh, no.

1561
01:42:58.698 --> 01:43:01.494
She's in peril.
What will you do?

1562
01:43:03.461 --> 01:43:05.360
You know what your problem is?

1563
01:43:06.947 --> 01:43:09.640
Family.

1564
01:43:10.779 --> 01:43:12.401
You can't save 'em all.

1565
01:43:13.713 --> 01:43:16.611
Five. Four.

1566
01:43:16.612 --> 01:43:17.957
Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta.

1567
01:43:17.958 --> 01:43:19.476
Go on.

1568
01:43:19.477 --> 01:43:20.823
Two.

1569
01:43:32.801 --> 01:43:34.595
You don't like ballet.

1570
01:43:34.596 --> 01:43:36.286
I can feel it.

1571
01:43:36.287 --> 01:43:38.254
May I please have the God's Eye?

1572
01:43:38.255 --> 01:43:39.876
- Screw you.
- No?

1573
01:43:39.877 --> 01:43:40.981
Pretty please?

1574
01:43:42.362 --> 01:43:43.776
- Oh, there it is.

1575
01:43:43.777 --> 01:43:45.986
Ooh. Gotcha.

1576
01:43:46.953 --> 01:43:49.195
Good trade. Keep the car.

1577
01:43:49.196 --> 01:43:50.957
Oh, Dommy!

1578
01:43:52.269 --> 01:43:56.306
I told you, you
owe me suffering!

1579
01:43:56.307 --> 01:43:58.826
Your legacy isn't money or power

1580
01:43:58.827 --> 01:44:01.311
or the family you built
or the life you led.

1581
01:44:01.312 --> 01:44:04.452
It's the life you made.

1582
01:44:04.453 --> 01:44:07.938
And a father and his son...

1583
01:44:07.939 --> 01:44:09.250
is everything.

1584
01:44:09.251 --> 01:44:11.356
You killed my father
on this bridge.

1585
01:44:11.357 --> 01:44:15.084
And now I know where
to find your son.

1586
01:44:16.948 --> 01:44:19.296
<i>Enchanté.</i>

1587
01:44:28.477 --> 01:44:31.859
You're gonna be okay, Tess.
It went clear through.

1588
01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:33.274
Kinda hurts.

1589
01:44:33.275 --> 01:44:35.345
Your father would be proud.

1590
01:44:35.346 --> 01:44:37.347
Yeah.

1591
01:44:37.348 --> 01:44:39.799
You will stop him.

1592
01:44:41.179 --> 01:44:42.664
Have faith.

1593
01:44:54.227 --> 01:44:55.745
She needs a hospital.

1594
01:44:55.746 --> 01:44:57.644
Mm.

1595
01:45:17.008 --> 01:45:19.009
You're gonna be okay.

1596
01:45:19.010 --> 01:45:20.494
I got her.

1597
01:45:20.495 --> 01:45:22.117
Go save your son.

1598
01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:25.431
My nephew.

1599
01:45:38.616 --> 01:45:42.412
I'm not gonna say I'm sorry,
so let me do you one better.

1600
01:45:42.413 --> 01:45:44.760
Let's get your son.

1610
01:46:16.792 --> 01:46:19.104
So, it used to be an old mine,

1611
01:46:19.105 --> 01:46:21.831
and they blasted tunnels
deep into the mountain.

1612
01:46:21.832 --> 01:46:25.110
And I just, uh...

1613
01:46:25.111 --> 01:46:26.629
repurposed the place.

1614
01:46:26.630 --> 01:46:28.976
You just got to keep yourself
open to possibilities.

1615
01:46:28.977 --> 01:46:32.358
And, of course, [sighs] have
a lot of time on your hands.

1616
01:46:32.359 --> 01:46:34.879
You said we'd meet him here.

1617
01:46:40.022 --> 01:46:41.092
Hey.

1618
01:46:42.887 --> 01:46:43.647
You know your dad.

1619
01:46:43.648 --> 01:46:46.062
He's got to make it safe.

1620
01:46:46.063 --> 01:46:47.616
We'll just wait.

1621
01:46:50.170 --> 01:46:53.035
I love you, Uncle Jakob.

1622
01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:02.009
What's that?

1623
01:47:02.010 --> 01:47:05.391
That? Ah, project
I've been working on.

1624
01:47:05.392 --> 01:47:07.671
You wouldn't be interested.

1625
01:47:19.545 --> 01:47:21.994
All right, we're entering
Portuguese airspace.

1626
01:47:21.995 --> 01:47:24.619
Jakob's already there.
Any word from Dom?

1627
01:47:26.931 --> 01:47:28.794
Hey.

1628
01:47:28.795 --> 01:47:31.038
Why are you so
quiet? You all right?

1629
01:47:31.039 --> 01:47:33.523
Just been sitting
here thinking, man.

1630
01:47:33.524 --> 01:47:34.938
I knew I smelled
something burning in here.

1631
01:47:34.939 --> 01:47:39.218
Tej, it was my mission,
y'all took my lead,

1632
01:47:39.219 --> 01:47:42.014
and I messed this thing
up every step of the way.

1633
01:47:42.015 --> 01:47:44.707
I guess this whole...

1634
01:47:44.708 --> 01:47:46.847
leadership thing
really ain't for me.

1635
01:47:46.848 --> 01:47:49.884
You took us to London
on a container.

1636
01:47:49.885 --> 01:47:53.060
You spent thousands of
dollars of your own cash,

1637
01:47:53.061 --> 01:47:54.924
strapped to your ass,

1638
01:47:54.925 --> 01:47:57.582
that now smells
like cheap cologne.

1639
01:47:57.583 --> 01:47:59.584
Now you're sitting here
taking sole responsibility

1640
01:47:59.585 --> 01:48:01.724
for something that we all wear.

1641
01:48:01.725 --> 01:48:03.519
Yeah, I know. It sounds stupid.

1642
01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:04.796
Nah, it don't sound
stupid at all.

1643
01:48:04.797 --> 01:48:06.314
You know what it
sounds like to me?

1644
01:48:06.315 --> 01:48:08.801
That sounds like a leader.

1645
01:48:17.741 --> 01:48:20.019
Come on, man. Get
your ass up, man.

1646
01:48:21.330 --> 01:48:23.400
I love you, man.

1647
01:48:23.401 --> 01:48:24.678
I love you, too, bro.

1648
01:48:24.679 --> 01:48:27.750
Sometimes we got to
say, "I'm sorry."

1649
01:48:27.751 --> 01:48:29.545
I'm sorry for whupping
your ass, man,

1650
01:48:29.546 --> 01:48:31.408
'cause I didn't really
mean to do that.

1651
01:48:31.409 --> 01:48:33.376
The whole thing, it would've been a whole dif...
-

1652
01:48:33.377 --> 01:48:35.516
- You okay? What's wrong?

1653
01:48:35.517 --> 01:48:37.725
I'm just allergic
to your bullshit.

1654
01:48:37.726 --> 01:48:39.314
- Come on.

1655
01:48:42.731 --> 01:48:45.353
Hey, go easy there. You're
gonna break that thing.

1656
01:48:45.354 --> 01:48:47.217
- You all right?

1657
01:48:47.218 --> 01:48:48.840
God's Eye was just used to send

1658
01:48:48.841 --> 01:48:50.945
dozens of mercenaries
after Dom's son.

1659
01:48:50.946 --> 01:48:55.675
Something I created
hurting the people we love.

1660
01:48:58.436 --> 01:49:00.368
It was meant to help.

1661
01:49:00.369 --> 01:49:02.681
This is bigger than just Dante.

1662
01:49:02.682 --> 01:49:04.683
This is bigger than just us.

1663
01:49:04.684 --> 01:49:07.618
We have to stop
this monster now.

1664
01:49:21.563 --> 01:49:22.944
We got to go.

1665
01:49:44.241 --> 01:49:45.552
Hold on!

1666
01:49:55.114 --> 01:49:57.149
I got eyes on Uncle
Muscle and the kid.

1667
01:49:57.150 --> 01:49:59.324
All right, everybody,
remember the plan.

1668
01:49:59.325 --> 01:50:01.602
Contain and kidnap. Thank you.

1669
01:50:01.603 --> 01:50:03.362
No.

1670
01:50:03.363 --> 01:50:04.570
No guns.

1671
01:50:04.571 --> 01:50:06.745
I need this little shit alive.

1672
01:50:06.746 --> 01:50:08.334
At least for a while.

1673
01:50:37.881 --> 01:50:40.124
- You ready?
- Ready.

1674
01:50:57.141 --> 01:50:58.764
Holy sh...

1675
01:50:59.488 --> 01:51:01.006
Oh, no, you're
good. You're good.

1676
01:51:01.007 --> 01:51:03.595
Okay, uh, song lyrics,
stubbed toes and cannon cars.

1677
01:51:03.596 --> 01:51:04.873
Yeah.

1678
01:51:09.326 --> 01:51:11.052
Here we go!

1679
01:52:02.586 --> 01:52:04.208
It's stuck. It's stuck.

1680
01:52:07.694 --> 01:52:08.902
They got an army
down there, Dom.

1681
01:52:08.903 --> 01:52:10.904
Your team's not far out.

1682
01:52:10.905 --> 01:52:12.871
- Bring us down.
- I can't put her down here.

1683
01:52:12.872 --> 01:52:14.770
There's an airfield
seven klicks west.

1684
01:52:14.771 --> 01:52:16.910
Okay, we'll meet you
there. Now open the back.

1685
01:52:16.911 --> 01:52:19.879
Dom, there's really
nowhere to land.

1686
01:52:21.605 --> 01:52:23.952
Who said anything about landing?

1687
01:52:41.418 --> 01:52:43.178
Look.

1688
01:52:49.046 --> 01:52:51.048
I'm coming for you, son.

1689
01:53:00.299 --> 01:53:01.610
What the...

1690
01:53:31.882 --> 01:53:33.883
- Dad!
- Hey, son.

1691
01:53:33.884 --> 01:53:35.851
Good to see you, big bro.

1692
01:53:35.852 --> 01:53:38.577
Good to see you guys.
Follow me to that plane.

1693
01:53:38.578 --> 01:53:40.339
We're right behind you.

1694
01:53:42.859 --> 01:53:44.446
I got you now.

1695
01:53:52.558 --> 01:53:54.248
Aimes, we're on our way.

1696
01:53:54.249 --> 01:53:57.217
Dom, I'll be touching
down five klicks west.

1697
01:53:57.218 --> 01:53:58.875
But they're still on your tail.

1698
01:54:00.669 --> 01:54:02.292
It's jammed.

1699
01:54:06.089 --> 01:54:08.781
B, what are you doing?

1700
01:54:10.783 --> 01:54:12.267
Careful.

1701
01:54:13.820 --> 01:54:15.236
Okay, okay, okay.

1702
01:54:23.727 --> 01:54:26.625
Shut the front door.

1703
01:54:26.626 --> 01:54:28.145
Little B.

1704
01:54:34.980 --> 01:54:37.464
Uncle Jakob!

1705
01:54:37.465 --> 01:54:39.432
I fixed it!

1706
01:54:44.506 --> 01:54:45.851
B!

1707
01:54:45.852 --> 01:54:47.406
Toodle-oo.

1708
01:54:49.166 --> 01:54:50.684
- Help!
- Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta. Shut up.

1709
01:54:50.685 --> 01:54:51.961
Damn it.

1710
01:54:51.962 --> 01:54:54.032
You party? I party.

1711
01:54:54.033 --> 01:54:55.966
- Whoa.

1712
01:54:57.002 --> 01:54:59.590
Dom, I lost him.
Dante has Little B.

1713
01:55:19.127 --> 01:55:21.473
Hey, Dominic. Welcome
to the big showdown.

1714
01:55:21.474 --> 01:55:23.924
It's the last lap.
Check out my copilot.

1715
01:55:23.925 --> 01:55:26.754
- Dad!
- Who could've seen this coming?

1716
01:55:26.755 --> 01:55:28.654
I mean, you know, except for me.

1717
01:55:45.878 --> 01:55:48.467
Shit. Looks like my
fuel line's been shot.

1718
01:55:49.606 --> 01:55:52.953
- I can't get to him, Dom.
- Jakob, stay with me.

1719
01:55:52.954 --> 01:55:55.542
I'm out of this race.

1720
01:55:55.543 --> 01:55:56.992
It has to be you.

1721
01:55:56.993 --> 01:56:00.203
Hey, Dom! Got a little
surprise for you.

1722
01:56:10.075 --> 01:56:12.559
You raised a hell of a son, Dom.

1723
01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:15.666
Time for me to step out
from under your shadow.

1724
01:56:16.702 --> 01:56:18.496
Thanks for showing me the light.

1725
01:56:18.497 --> 01:56:19.842
Jakob?

1726
01:56:19.843 --> 01:56:21.293
<i>I'm gonna go clear the way.</i>

1727
01:56:22.673 --> 01:56:24.709
Go get your son.

1728
01:56:24.710 --> 01:56:26.055
Jakob, don't!

1729
01:56:26.056 --> 01:56:28.127
- Don't!

1730
01:56:36.929 --> 01:56:38.413
Uncle Jakob!

1731
01:57:02.713 --> 01:57:05.922
Looks like Uncle Muscle won't
be coming to the next barbecue.

1732
01:57:05.923 --> 01:57:08.028
Oh.

1733
01:57:08.029 --> 01:57:09.651
I mean, it's very honorable.

1734
01:57:11.170 --> 01:57:13.378
Three miles away.
Take the service road.

1735
01:57:13.379 --> 01:57:15.105
It'll lead you right
to the airfield.

1736
01:57:26.530 --> 01:57:29.292
You know how to beat your
dad in a street race?

1737
01:57:36.747 --> 01:57:38.058
Take away the streets.

1738
01:57:38.059 --> 01:57:39.785
- Dad!

1739
01:57:45.687 --> 01:57:47.550
Amazing.

1740
01:57:47.551 --> 01:57:48.656
Oh.

1741
01:58:02.048 --> 01:58:04.534
We got it. We got it.

1742
01:58:12.507 --> 01:58:13.508
My turn.

1743
01:58:37.843 --> 01:58:40.432
He's good. Your dad's good.

1744
01:58:45.506 --> 01:58:47.196
Dom, you got one mile left.

1745
01:58:47.197 --> 01:58:50.234
Son, I never break a promise.

1746
01:58:50.235 --> 01:58:53.720
Now, let's finish
that driving lesson.

1747
01:58:53.721 --> 01:58:55.204
Feel the car,

1748
01:58:55.205 --> 01:58:57.068
find your line

1749
01:58:57.069 --> 01:58:58.484
and fly.

1750
01:59:19.712 --> 01:59:20.748
- Oh!

1751
01:59:35.038 --> 01:59:37.247
- Now!

1752
01:59:50.881 --> 01:59:51.951
No.

1753
01:59:54.057 --> 01:59:55.265
Take the service road now.

1754
02:00:03.515 --> 02:00:05.447
- I'm wheels down.
- We're headed to you now.

1755
02:00:05.448 --> 02:00:07.449
Your team is on their way.

1756
02:00:07.450 --> 02:00:09.174
I'll meet you at the airfield.

1757
02:00:09.175 --> 02:00:11.280
- You okay?
- I'm good, Dad.

1758
02:00:11.281 --> 02:00:13.594
I'm real proud of you, son.

1759
02:00:58.949 --> 02:01:01.296
Oh, Dommy boy.

1760
02:01:01.297 --> 02:01:03.194
It's so good to see you again.

1761
02:01:03.195 --> 02:01:05.714
Did you hit me with a
helicopter back there?

1762
02:01:05.715 --> 02:01:07.198
Hmm.

1763
02:01:07.199 --> 02:01:09.856
Ow, you big brute.
I mean, I get it.

1764
02:01:09.857 --> 02:01:12.272
You're showing off
in front of your son.

1765
02:01:12.273 --> 02:01:13.653
But honestly, did
you really think

1766
02:01:13.654 --> 02:01:16.656
it was going to be that easy?

1767
02:01:16.657 --> 02:01:19.072
You're exactly where
I wanted you to be.

1768
02:01:19.073 --> 02:01:21.005
Yes.

1769
02:01:21.006 --> 02:01:22.834
Wait for it.

1770
02:01:22.835 --> 02:01:25.079
I got a surprise for you.

1771
02:01:31.775 --> 02:01:34.468
The cavalry's here.
We got you, Dom.

1772
02:01:35.710 --> 02:01:37.850
Roman, get out of
here. It's a trap.

1773
02:01:41.751 --> 02:01:43.131
Incoming!

1774
02:01:58.284 --> 02:01:59.769
Yes!

1775
02:02:00.839 --> 02:02:03.462
See, that's the problem
with having a big family.

1776
02:02:07.017 --> 02:02:08.778
Can't protect 'em all.

1777
02:02:14.059 --> 02:02:15.335
Ooh!

1778
02:02:15.336 --> 02:02:17.683
Oh, Dominic, is that
your new friend?

1779
02:02:18.443 --> 02:02:20.064
Aw.

1780
02:02:20.065 --> 02:02:21.721
You are so predictable.

1781
02:02:21.722 --> 02:02:25.138
You think everyone's
gonna end up on your side?

1782
02:02:25.139 --> 02:02:28.383
Problem is Aimes was mine first.

1783
02:02:28.384 --> 02:02:31.765
Now the work begins.

1784
02:02:31.766 --> 02:02:33.388
And in there,

1785
02:02:33.389 --> 02:02:36.392
today we'll put our family
on a path to real power.

1786
02:02:37.945 --> 02:02:39.015
Let's get started.

1787
02:02:48.438 --> 02:02:50.094
Well, looks like
our partnership's

1788
02:02:50.095 --> 02:02:52.442
off to a fantastic start.

1789
02:02:55.445 --> 02:02:58.205
You know, Dominic, to
become a real saint,

1790
02:02:58.206 --> 02:02:59.966
you have to perform miracles.

1791
02:02:59.967 --> 02:03:02.071
Or die a martyr.

1792
02:03:02.072 --> 02:03:04.178
So what's it gonna be?

1793
02:03:12.428 --> 02:03:16.258
I took your money,
I took your freedom,

1794
02:03:16.259 --> 02:03:18.226
and I'm gonna take your family.

1795
02:03:19.020 --> 02:03:20.435
And you're gonna die

1796
02:03:20.436 --> 02:03:22.610
knowing that you
couldn't save your son.

1797
02:03:25.510 --> 02:03:27.476
Dad.

1798
02:03:27.477 --> 02:03:29.479
I have faith.

1799
02:03:37.004 --> 02:03:39.696
You made one mistake.

1800
02:03:40.559 --> 02:03:42.768
You never took my car.

1801
02:04:03.099 --> 02:04:04.169
Oh!

1802
02:06:02.667 --> 02:06:04.392
The suffering is over, Dom.

1803
02:06:09.812 --> 02:06:12.090
It's time for you to die.

1804
02:07:11.356 --> 02:07:13.427
No way.

1805
02:07:14.531 --> 02:07:16.188
