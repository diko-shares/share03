00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,180
The Mifulu represent
a fascinating example

3
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,090
of failed culture.
The people of the Mifulu

4
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,790
communicated
entirely in rhyme,

5
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,630
although that's actually
less impressive than it sounds,

6
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,260
because their language
only contained one vowel.

7
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,270
Also, if you've
noticed,

8
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,540
the only artifacts
we've been able to unearth

9
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,510
are primitive musical
instruments.

10
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,270
The Mifulus had
plenty of drums,

11
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,280
guitars, harmonicas
and the like,

12
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,310
but no weapons
or tools.

13
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,510
So, in essence,
they had rhythm, they had music,

14
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,050
but they had no
hammers and spears,

15
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,060
so they died.

16
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,030
In any case, this brings us
to the final room of the tour

17
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,690
and my personal
favorite-

18
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,360
The Hall
of Norse Mythology.

19
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,200
This is Odin,

20
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,210
chief divinity of the entire
Norse pantheon--

21
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,210
"The Allfather"
as he's called--

22
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,270
and these paintings depict
some of Odin's many sons.

23
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,370
That is Thor,
God of Thunder,

24
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,380
with his mighty hammer.

25
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,650
And this is Balder,
God of Beauty.

26
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,450
Who's that ugly guy?

27
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,620
Oh, I was just
about to get to him.

28
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,020
That's Loki,
Norse God of Mischief.

29
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,390
He was also known
as "The Trickster."

30
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,400
As the youngest
son of Odin,

31
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,330
Loki was the black sheep
of the Norse mythological family.

32
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,340
His constant
mischievous pranks

33
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,340
were an endless source
of embarrassment

34
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,340
to his father
and his siblings.

35
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,600
He was, in other words,
a bratty little brother.

36
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,200
And Loki's ultimate tool
of mischief was this,

37
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,650
the mask
which he created

38
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,810
and tossed down to earth
thousands of years ago

39
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,080
to create mayhem among the mortals.
For, according to legend,

40
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,920
the wearer of the mask is imbued
with the powers of Loki himself.

41
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,260
- Is that true?
- No, of course not.

42
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,820
If it were, I'd be
wearing it myself.

43
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,590
No, no, it's textbook
mythical allegory.

44
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,600
Loki represents
the "id,"

45
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,600
the suppressed parts
of ourselves,

46
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,830
and the mask is the tool
which unleashes the id.

47
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,360
I go into this very topic
in my critically acclaimed book.

48
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,710
Now, of all
the Aesir gods--

49
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,240
excuse me, sir.
Please don't touch the mask display.

50
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,080
Of all the Aesir gods,

51
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,180
Loki was the only one
who could shape shift--

52
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,480
change his form,
even turn himself into a woman.

53
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,460
A woman?! Man alive,
lock up your sons and daughters

54
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,690
around that twisted
piece of fruitcake, hey, Doc?

55
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,360
Well, I guess that's
one way of putting it.

56
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,960
Anyway, Loki brought nothing
but shame to Odin and his ilk.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,370
In fact, Loki was
such an unruly child

58
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,460
that Odin ultimately
locked him up in chains

59
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,200
far beneath the earth.

60
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,440
He did not!

61
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,900
- Good God!
- And don't you forget it!

62
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,680
Apparently, you do not
agree with my theories.

63
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,510
Finally!

64
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,780
- This is a fake!
- Yes, but it's a good fake.

65
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,530
Ow. Sir, that
is museum property.

66
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,160
Oh, I'm sorry.
Let me replace it.

67
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,500
What-- what are--
what are you doing?

68
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,840
Perhaps I should inform you
I suffer from vertigo

69
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,000
and I have a lawyer.

70
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,670
Hello?

71
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,380
Where's my body?
Come get me.

72
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,910
- Yeah. Oh yeah.
- Hold it right there!

73
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,220
I don't like it here.

74
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,470
Thanks for dropping by.

75
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,590
- Dropping?
- Bye.

76
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,040
Where's... my...

77
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,070
mask?!

78
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,100
Who's a happy baby?

79
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,590
Who's a happy baby?

80
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,440
Aw, Clare, he's amazing.
Honey, look at him.

81
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,910
They said he's very
alert for his age.

82
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,850
He's going to be
a genius

83
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,910
just like his brothers
and sisters.

84
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:45,350
Little Tommy's starting
Junior Mensa next week...

85
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,950
and Clancy just took
his first potty poop.

86
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,010
Oh, look. Honey, he just
took his first poop.

87
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,220
Good poop, Clancy!

88
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,920
Whoa, Captain Underpants,

89
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,430
watch your aim.
He's gonna need those.

90
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,960
- You okay?
- Yup.

91
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,800
Here. Mm-hmm.

92
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,670
So, when are you two gonna have
one for yourselves?

93
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,810
Oh...

94
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,380
It's a boy.

95
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,550
And agirl!

96
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,420
- Twins?
- And another boy!

97
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,430
- Girl.
- Boy.

98
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,430
- Girl.
- Boy.

99
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,190
Girl, boy, girl, boy...

100
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,600
Tim!

101
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,300
Whew.

102
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,640
Okay, I'm just
gonna say it.

103
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,470
That was flat out
embarrassing.

104
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,950
The mere mention
of the word "baby" and your throat

105
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,680
seizes up like
you swallowed Drano.

106
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,480
After seeing those kids,

107
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,580
Drano sounds like
a good option.

108
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,780
- Honey, just think...
- Yeah?

109
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,090
if we have a baby, you'll have someone
you can play video games with.

110
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,620
Mm-hmm.

111
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,630
- Hey!
- You'll have someone you can relate to.

112
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,930
Okay, honey, look.
I know you're upset, okay?

113
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,670
- But can I ask you one question?
- What?

114
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,270
Who's a fish?
Who's a fish?

115
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,040
Tim, stop it.
I mean it.

116
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,510
Look, babe,
who's a turkey?

117
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,520
Bawk bawk bawk
bawk bawk!

118
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,450
- I'm serious!
- Who's a rabid dog?

119
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,680
Ow!

120
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,460
- Who's Hannibal the Cannibal?
- Stop it.

121
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,860
Jeez, babe.

122
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,700
Okay, I'm driving--
driving-- driving here!

123
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,240
- Ugh.
- Honey, slow down.

124
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,680
You know I can't run and apologize
at the same time.

125
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,980
Come on, Tonya. I'm not saying
I don't want to have a baby.

126
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,580
I'm just saying I don't want to have
a baby right now.

127
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,050
So why not?
Why not now?

128
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,110
- Because.
- Ugh.

129
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,130
Wha-- babe!

130
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,920
Tonya!
Ton-ton--

131
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,030
Hey, Otis.

132
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,660
You got room
in your doghouse?

133
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,070
Here you go.
Here you go. Yeah!

134
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,980
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

135
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,980
Up.

136
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,180
You're good, aren't you?
Now, get in the hole.

137
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,210
Tretiak's in the net
for the Soviets.

138
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,280
Paul Henderson's out
of the penalty box.

139
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,730
He's on the break!
he shoots!

140
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,130
Oh, what a save!

141
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,230
What a comeback!
Oh! Free beef jerky for everybody!

142
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:53,260
And the ice is being pelted
with Kibbles 'n Bits.

143
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,140
What's this?

144
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,200
Now, Otis, how many
times have I told you?

145
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,780
If you're gonna steal something,
steal something with a little value.

146
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,620
That's what we're looking for.
Get up here, come on.

147
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,710
Come here.

148
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,550
Thanks, pal.
Your kissing is getting a lot better.

149
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,520
You don't want a baby
right now, do you?

150
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,130
He said it.

151
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,160
Mmm.

152
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:35,710
LOKl!

153
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,520
Dad?

154
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:51,290
I-I mean,
Oh, masterful Odin, is that you?

155
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:54,820
Have you found
your mask, Loki?

156
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,800
I found a mask,
but as it turns out,

157
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,570
- it was a fake.
- Why are you relaxing on this beach?

158
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,170
I'm just taking a few
moments reprieve from my--

159
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,140
Nonsense!
That mask

160
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,910
has caused enough mischief
and malfeasance among the mortals.

161
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,710
I curse the day
you created that thing.

162
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,150
Why don't you just use
that all-seeing eye of yours

163
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,920
- and tell me where it is?
- This is your mess

164
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,580
and you will clean it up!

165
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,060
You're a god!
Now start acting like one!

166
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,720
Now, find that mask

167
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,360
before I open up a can
of lightning on you!

168
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,930
Do you need anything
while I'm out?

169
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,170
I'm just gonna go make
a baby with the neighbor.

170
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,940
- Honey, come here.
- What?

171
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,970
Look! Look at all
this stuff.

172
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,790
I've been trying to do
this for 10 years

173
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,050
of my life, creating
these shows and--

174
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,620
I just need more time.

175
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,390
Okay, I get it, okay?

176
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,400
You want your own show,

177
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,660
and I want you
to have your own show.

178
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,930
You're so good!

179
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,030
But I also...

180
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,410
really, really
wanna have a baby.

181
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,150
So, what do we do?

182
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,650
I want our child
to be proud of us,

183
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,660
both of us.

184
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,820
And if somebody asks that child,
"Hey, what does your mommy do?"

185
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,060
He's gonna say, "Oh, she's the managing
director of Apt Apparel."

186
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,590
They'll say, "Cool." When they say,
"What does your daddy do?"

187
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:36,260
They'll say,
"He's a-- he's a--"

188
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,930
Hey, boys and girls.
I'm Torpedo Tortoise!

189
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,500

190
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,310

191
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,410

192
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,680

193
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,190

194
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,380
And here's one for you.

195
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,890
Halloween party's
tomorrow night, homes.

196
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:04,290
- Got a costume?
- No.

197
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,660
Hey, maybe you could
go as a turtle.

198
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,330
Thanks, Chad.

199
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,660
I can't believe Chad
got promoted again.

200
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,480
When the executives look at me,
all they see is a tortoise.

201
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,880
Hey man, you want things
to change, you gotta make 'em change.

202
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:24,150
- You ever pitch to the top man himself?
- Daniel Moss? Hell no.

203
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,150
Well, then it's time
to man up, my road dog,

204
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,980
because there he is.

205
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,320
Oh my God.
He never eats lunch down here.

206
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,090
He's too busy being
an animation god!

207
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,250
Then it's fate, man.
You got to go over there

208
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,920
and say, "Yo, I am
Tim Avery and I've been slugging away

209
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,630
in this costume
for six months now

210
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:43,160
and I got an idea
for a show and you need to hear it."

211
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,830
Be aggressive, man.
If a bug bites you, bite him back!

212
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,570
Oh, you mean like you
have with Sylvia?

213
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,080
Shut up.

214
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,980
You know,
maybe I should.

215
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,540
- Should what?
- Just walk up to Daniel.

216
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,980
- I mean, he's just a guy, right?
- Right.

217
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,080
- What do I have to lose?
- You got nothing to lose, man!

218
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,590
- I'm gonna do it.
- Are you crazy?

219
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,730
Hey, Torpedo Tortoise.

220
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,760
Hi.

221
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,340
Something I can
do for you?

222
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,370
Uhm...

223
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,110
actually, yes.
Yes, you can.

224
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:31,610
Um, see I've been
in the turtle suit for a while now,

225
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,450
but, uh, I'm
a trained animator.

226
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,450
I went to school
and everything,

227
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,960
and, uhm, I got an idea
for a show that, uh,

228
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,790
you gotta hear.

229
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:42,620
Cool.
Lay it on me.

230
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,760
Now?

231
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,770
So what did he say?

232
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,430
That my ideas lacked spark,
but the door was always open.

233
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,270
Well, that's
a good thing.

234
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,760
No. It's always open so he can push
guys like me out of it.

235
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,410
Come on, Otis.

236
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,780
Otis. Come on.

237
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,120
Come on, boy.
Come on, Otis.

238
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,980
Thank you, Otis.

239
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,510
You're so sweet
and thoughtful.

240
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,980
Which is why you'd make
such a great dad.

241
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,210
- What are you wearing?
- Oh.

242
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,220
Well, I was gonna go
as a werewolf victim,

243
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,190
but Otis ruined my mask.

244
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,350
Well, honey, you know,
we've got so much stuff around here.

245
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,800
I don't know, just--
wear that thing.

246
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,490
This?

247
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,160
I can't go as this.

248
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,570
Everyone at Animagine always goes
all out with their costumes.

249
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:02,340
This is the crappiest
piece of crap in Craptown.

250
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,440
Be a lot less crappy
if you went with me, though.

251
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,540
I know, but I can't.
I gotta finish the Orion brochure.

252
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,020
- You know what?
- Hmm?

253
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,040
Go to the party...

254
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,190
have fun,

255
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,190
and when you get home,

256
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,850
you can tell me
all about it.

257
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,540
So lame.

258
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,640
Whoa!
What the...?

259
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,100
Don't you just
love Halloween?

260
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,370
Whoa!

261
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,810
Trick or treat.

262
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,470
Hardy-har.
Let me see your work lD, please.

263
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:50,470
- lD?
- No lD, no party.

264
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,010
Where did the wife
put that invitation?

265
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,260
ID, not lV.

266
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:01,590
Excuse me.
My bad.

267
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,760
Maybe I left it in
my other pants.

268
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,470
- Crazy!
- Okay.

269
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,960
Here's your drink.

270
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,510
This party
is embarrassing.

271
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,520
Can't we stir
things up a little?

272
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,950
- I'm on it.
- Go get 'em.

273
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,360
Who's that green guy?

274
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,030
You'd better cover up,
young lady.

275
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,660
You might catch
a chest cold.

276
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,690
Ah.

277
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,100
What am I thinking?

278
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,110
Whoa! Oh!

279
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,770
Hey!
Oh!

280
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,800
- Whoo! Whoo!
- Ah.

281
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,880
- Jorge.
- Sylvia.

282
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,780
Thank you, God.

283
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:05,190

284
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,220

285
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,990
Boo! Boo!

286
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,550
Now hold on.
Where is everybody going?

287
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,660
Whoo! All right.
All right!

288
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,730
- Boo! Lame!
- Whoo-hoo!

289
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:21,640

290
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:24,840

291
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,570

292
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:30,170

293
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,010

294
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,780

295
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,020

296
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,020

297
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,860

298
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,450

299
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,900

300
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,900

301
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,900

302
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,530

303
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:56,540

304
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,640

305
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,950

306
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,220

307
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,450

308
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,390

309
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,390

310
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,730

311
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,100

312
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,100

313
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,070

314
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,770

315
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,240

316
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,910

317
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,320

318
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,790

319
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,790

320
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,590

321
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,360

322
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,160

323
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,720

324
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:57,290

325
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,740

326
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,650

327
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,880

328
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,780

329
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,950

330
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,360

331
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,360

332
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,760

333
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,530

334
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,360

335
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,330

336
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,630

337
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,610

338
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,870

339
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,980

340
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,010

341
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,720
Honey, I'm home.

342
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,370
- Babe, what's gotten into you?
- Let's find out.

343
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,640
That was off the chain
last night, guru.

344
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,410
You were a whirling dervish
of craziness, homes.

345
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,040
Hey, um, did you--
did you use holograms

346
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,240
for-- for all that--
that stuff?

347
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,950
Whoa, Avery, I didn't know
you had it in you, man!

348
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,150
Yeah, well,
me neither.

349
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,350
- Tim Avery?
- Yeah.

350
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,620
Daniel Moss would
like to see you in his office.

351
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,650
Do you have
a minute?

352
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,470
This has potential.

353
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,210
Come here.
Come here.

354
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,450
This has that spark
I was looking for.

355
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,460
I mean, not to be
crass about it,

356
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:59,330
but this guy-- this could be
a franchise character.

357
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:03,020
How'd you come up
with this?

358
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,400
M-my dog brought
it to me.

359
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,970
Oh, yeah. If we knew
where the great ones came from,

360
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,100
we'd go there
every day, right?

361
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,200
Yeah.

362
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,580
Listen,

363
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,410
I think we could
do something with this.

364
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,790
How would you
like to move up to the second floor?

365
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,480
Where is it?
Where is it?

366
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,690
Otis! You know that mask
you were chewing on,

367
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,700
the wooden one?
Where is it, boy?

368
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:43,270
Find it and I'll take
you to see Venus--

369
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,870
you know, that cute little Jack Russell
you're always trying to jump?

370
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:48,850
Yes, I think you guys
would make a good couple.

371
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,850
I don't know.
I don't speak Doberman.

372
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,940
Babe!
I got incredible news!

373
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,380
Really?
I think I do too!

374
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,390
- Really? What?
- Um, you go.

375
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,010
- No, you go.
- Okay, I'm gonna go.

376
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,650
- Babe, let me go.
- Okay, go.

377
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:03,560
Guess who got moved up
to the second floor?

378
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:09,500
Oh God, that is so great!
I am so proud of you.

379
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:12,660
- Oh, then it was meant to be.
- What's meant to be? What's your news?

380
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,930
I've been feeling
really funky all day

381
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:18,030
- and you're not gonna believe this.
- I'm not gonna believe what?

382
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,410
- Tell me! What? What?
- Okay. I think I might be...

383
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,950
- Pregnant.
- Yes!

384
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,680
Oh, but how can that be, 'cause we--
that can't be-- we just--

385
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,050
Who's a fish?
Who's a fish?

386
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,620
Where's there a trashcan?
Where's there a trashcan?

387
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,570
- Is that normal?
- No.

388
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:52,010
And what's worse,
it's not covered by insurance.

389
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:57,110

390
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,880

391
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,010

392
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,610

393
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:07,220

394
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,890

395
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:11,720

396
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,460

397
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,760

398
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,170

399
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,430

400
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,070

401
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,080

402
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,740

403
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,720
- Wow.
- What?

404
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,270

405
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,220

406
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:39,550

407
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,560

408
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:45,930

409
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,950
Oh, Alvey.

410
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,490
Say hello to your son.

411
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,630
Uh, hello there, son.

412
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,640
I've been waiting
to meet you

413
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,470
for nine months now.

414
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:06,150
Whoa. He's got
a killer grip.

415
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,650
But Dad counteracts
with his Pinky of Doom.

416
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,890
Hey, do you know
who I am?

417
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,620
I'm your dad.

418
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,160
Loki!

419
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,510
There was a baby

420
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,200
born of the mask!

421
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:45,140
Damn!
Where's my mask?!

422
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,490
Sir, y-you're gonna
have to pay for that.

423
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,960
The advertisement
said they were authentic!

424
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,970
They are authentic.

425
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,340
They're authentic Pakistani
Norse Mythology masks.

426
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,710
Okay.
Now let me think.

427
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:10,270
What should
I turn him into?

428
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:15,120
Loki!

429
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,890
Dad?

430
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,450
Fool!

431
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:23,190
What in Helveti were you
about to do to this shopkeep?

432
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,390
- Nothing, I was just--
- Fool!

433
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,400
Don't you dare
lie to me.

434
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:30,030
You know, Thor never gave me
this kind of trouble.

435
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,730
Okay, here we go again
with the Thor crap.

436
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:35,530
Thor, Thor, Thor.
You know, father, I'm not like Thor.

437
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:37,600
I'm never gonna
be like Thor.

438
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,540
I just wish that--
can't you just

439
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,840
Iove me for who I am

440
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,210
and not for who I'm not?

441
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,050
No! I want you to be
more like Thor!

442
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,050
Now, I've wasted
enough time here.

443
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:51,050
I felt a tremor.

444
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,520
A child has been
born of the mask!

445
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,820
Wow. A baby's born
of the mask,

446
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,920
so that sort of makes me
kind of like a dad, huh?

447
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,230
- Find it!
- The baby or the mask?

448
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,230
Find the baby

449
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,600
and you will
find the mask.

450
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,630
Right.

451
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,380
Tonya, have you
seen Otis?

452
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,400
He's in his
new doghouse!

453
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:18,580
Who's a happy baby?

454
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,310
Who's a happy baby?

455
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,510
Let's blow up
another one.

456
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,950
You like these, huh?
They're pretty!

457
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,960
Honey, honey, honey,
just a second ago,

458
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,990
he was counting the balloons.
He held up five fingers.

459
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,000
That's great, hon.
I gotta go.

460
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,760
Daniel brought in Chad
to backstab me-- oh, I mean help me--

461
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,100
and I gotta get to work
before he helps me out of a job.

462
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,100
Hey.

463
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,300
What do you think,
Double A?

464
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:46,370
Would you watch this, huh? Hey hon,
I know I've asked like a million times,

465
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:49,380
but you happen to see that mask I was
looking for, you know the wooden one--

466
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:52,110
Okay, a billion times, and no.
Why do you need it so badly?

467
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:55,050
I don't need it.
Who said I need it? Don't need it.

468
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:57,050
- Bye.
- Bye.

469
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:59,220
Bye. Say "Bye, Daddy."
Bye bye.

470
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:02,230
Bye bye. Here.
You want another one?

471
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,230
Okay, watch,
watch, watch.

472
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,760
"l want you to be
more like Thor."

473
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,770
Oh, what a jerk.

474
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,170
Oh hey!
It's my ear, nose and throat guy.

475
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,170
Odin thinks
he's so great.

476
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,370
Hello! No one even
worships you anymore.

477
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,200
I could have
been a doctor

478
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,340
if the SAT weren't
so culturally biased.

479
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,680
Now, let's see. Oh, "lnfectious
Diseases," that always cracks me up.

480
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,610
Maternity ward.

481
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,780
Okay, first I find
the magic baby,

482
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,650
then downstairs to the cafeteria
for some Jell-O brick.

483
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:07,180
Who do you have to sting to get some
answers in this place?

484
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,850
Bingo!

485
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,860
All right,
here we go.

486
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,860
Buckle up.

487
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,020
Oh, hold on tight.
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

488
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,030
Okay, baby, this
is gonna hurt you

489
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,000
more than it's
gonna hurt me.

490
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,970
Ah!

491
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,180
Okay, let's start with...

492
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,480
uh, July 27th.

493
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:42,280
Babies born on that day.

494
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:44,990
Oh, my. Why are there
so many babies born?

495
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,900
- Who are you?
- You.

496
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,930
- Me?
- Who?

497
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:05,770

498
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,110

499
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:11,120

500
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,120

501
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,790

502
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:18,230

503
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:21,530

504
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,560

505
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,070

506
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,980

507
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:37,380

508
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:41,110

509
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:44,140

510
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:48,180

511
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,720

512
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,990
Huh?

513
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,560
Hmm?

514
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,790

515
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,170

516
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,230

517
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:07,180

518
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:10,270

519
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:18,580
- It's okay, baby. I got him.
- Okay.

520
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,030
Tim.
Tim.

521
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,840
- Okay, it's my turn.
- No, no. It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

522
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,900
- It's-- it's my turn?
- He's asleep. He's asleep.

523
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,920
But, baby, can you go in
late to work today?

524
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:48,480
My office just called. Um, they're
sending me to New York for a week.

525
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:57,660
- Hey, where you going?
- I'm-- I'm sorry, Daniel.

526
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,320
My wife's gotta go out of town
for work. It's just a week,

527
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,300
but I have to take care
of the baby.

528
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:04,730
Hey, you gotta do the kid
thing, I understand.

529
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:08,170
Just unfortunate timing.
The network called,

530
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:11,230
they want to see our green guy
thing by the end of the week,

531
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,070
but I'll just put
Chad on it.

532
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,380
- I'm on it.
- What?

533
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,380
I said I need to be home,
as in my house,

534
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,390
but I didn't say
I couldn't work.

535
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,390
Line up the pitch.
I'm on it,

536
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,410
and I won't let
you down.

537
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:31,820
Cool. Try to give it that spark I saw
at the Halloween party.

538
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,660
Okay.

539
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,030
I left all the phone numbers
on the refrigerator

540
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,560
and you need to give him a bath
before he goes to bed,

541
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,830
but don't get any water in his ears,
'cause he freaks out a little bit.

542
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:44,500
Um, and if he gets cranky,
you just put him in his car seat

543
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:47,740
and play the Baby Mozart CD, but don't
just pop him in front of the TV;,

544
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,750
it's gonna
make him stupid.

545
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,810
Um, uh, if you feel
like you're drowning,

546
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,340
just go see Betty down the
street. She has like 10 kids.

547
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,580
- Honey? Do I have to mash his bananas?
- Yeah?

548
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,250
- l-- l--
- Okay, you're gonna be fine.

549
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,690
Can I say goodbye?

550
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:05,530
Mommy loves you
so much.

551
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,090
Okay.

552
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:10,120
And Mommy loves you too.

553
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,730
- Mommy, I can't do this.
- Huh? You can.

554
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,240
- I can't.
- You can.

555
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:15,530
Mommy. Honey, take him.

556
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,670
- Bye.
- Honey, take him.

557
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,300
- I love you.
- Honey, take him.

558
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,280
Bye.

559
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:23,300
Bye.

560
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,760
Okay.
All right, Alvey.

561
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:39,730
Okay. All right.
We're gonna have a good time.

562
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,890
Here we go.
Come on. Yes.

563
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,800
Look at the pretty colors.

564
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,300
Oh, look! Ah, ee.

565
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,670
Fun, right?

566
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,150
Look at me!
I'm happy, I'm... happy.

567
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:12,290
Okay.

568
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,590
Okay, buddy,

569
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,660
it's just you
and me this morning

570
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,670
and we're gonna
have fun and gonna play.

571
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,700
You excited?
Okay.

572
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,400
- Hello?
- Hey, buddy. Can you get down here now?

573
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:31,010
- Daniel's asking for you.
- No, I can't come in right now.

574
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:33,810
- I'm stuck here with my kid.
- You'd better think of something.

575
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:36,340
He wants to see your drawings
before the pitch on Friday.

576
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:39,620
All right. I'll do the drawings now
and I'll fax 'em over after lunch.

577
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,650
- All right.
- Okay, bye.

578
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:44,560
Hey, pal.

579
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,430
Daddy's got a teensy-weensy bit
of work to do,

580
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:50,430
so can you be a good
boy and let him?

581
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,080
Hello?

582
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:08,050
- Honey, hey!
- Hey, hon, how you doin'?

583
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:10,880
So, how are you
and Alvey doing?

584
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,120
Oh, we're doing fine.
Yeah, we're doing great.

585
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,390
Two little peas in a pod.
How's your thing going?

586
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,980
Good. Uh, he loved
the comps,

587
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,050
so now we just gotta rush
it all into production.

588
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,060
So, how's Alvey?

589
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,070
Is he eating?
How's he sleeping?

590
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,330
Hold on, hon.
Somebody wants to talk to you.

591
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:28,500
Hi! How's my little
womping wompet?

592
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,440
Oh, I miss you. I just want to kiss you
and kiss you and kiss you!

593
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,940
Okay, hon.
Yeah, he loves you too.

594
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,470
- Hurry home. Bye.
- Okay, bye.

595
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,000
Aww.

596
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,480
Well, isn't it great

597
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,080
that her work
is going so well?

598
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,780
- Ma?
- Yes. Ma and her career are just--

599
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,860
- Did you say ma?
- Mama.

600
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,860
Oh my God.
You said mama!

601
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,860
Well, can you say "dad"

602
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,590
- or "da-da?"
- Mommy.

603
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,070
That's great!
You're doing great!

604
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:04,300
but come on,
say "da-da". Da-da

605
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,140
Mother.

606
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:15,180
Timmy Tyler,
are you my mask baby?

607
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,560
- Yes?
- Good afternoon!

608
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,500
- May I come in?
- Ah--

609
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,870
What a lovely abode.
Oh my, and such a lush carpet.

610
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,870
You're exactly
the kind of person

611
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:38,310
the Vacuummeister 3000
was invented for!

612
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,870
Well, if I don't
clean up, no one will.

613
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:43,680
That is why you need
the Vacuummeister 3000!

614
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:46,080
It has dual sweeps,
durable airpaths,

615
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,980
jiggle control, multi-Teflon
coated filtering

616
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,450
and it's built
with a direct-drive design

617
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:52,180
that is so powerful,
it sucks the dirt

618
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,780
off the dirt!

619
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:57,120
- Is that safe?
- Allow me to demonstrate.

620
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,130
- Oh, don't you need to plug it in?
- No.

621
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:04,560
This is a terrible
demonstration.

622
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:17,510
Hello, you little...
ugly thing.

623
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,850
Let's see if you're
the one, hmm?

624
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:26,050
Bend. Morph!

625
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,820
Shape shift.

626
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,850
Well, do something
for Odin's sake.

627
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,430
No!

628
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:46,270
I think it's time to introduce you
to man's best friend.

629
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:49,510
And I don't
mean you, Otis.

630
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,510
Okay.

631
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,520
Mommy doesn't want me
to do this,

632
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:56,250
but what Mommy doesn't
know won't hurt her.

633
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,690
-...sour cream and onion...
- Oh, look.

634
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,490
Hey, wait a minute.

635
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:08,120
We don't like
your attitude!

636
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:10,760
Keep an eye
on him, will ya?

637
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:19,330
Look at Bam Bam.

638
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,640
Bam! Bam!
Bam! Bam! Bam!

639
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,010
Bam Bam looks miserable
without Pebbles.

640
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:32,360
Bam.

641
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:04,450
Bam, bam, bam.

642
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,660
Smoking!

643
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:04,570

644
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:06,740

645
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,010

646
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:11,380

647
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,190

648
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:17,190

649
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:20,360

650
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,730

651
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:28,740

652
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:33,400

653
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,780

654
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:39,710

655
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:55,860

656
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,870

657
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,630

658
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,010
I don't know how.
I don't know which end is up.

659
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:49,480
I'm running on fumes.

660
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,780
Yeah.
Yeah.

661
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:57,290
I don't know.

662
00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:00,130
Yeah, I've still
got the kid.

663
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,690
Oh God,
you have no idea.

664
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:05,330
Man, they just suck
the life out of you.

665
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:07,340
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with him.

666
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:09,860
I think I may be on to something
for my pitch, though.

667
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:11,900
I don't know,
it's just--

668
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,640

669
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,670

670
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,080

671
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,990

672
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,150

673
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:29,320

674
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,760

675
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,300
Yow! Ooh!

676
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,080
Hi, 911?
I already told you.

677
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,150
My son is bouncing
off the walls!

678
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:05,820
Yes, off the walls,
the couch,

679
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:09,030
and the ceiling.
Hello. Hello? Hello?!

680
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:11,690

681
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:14,930

682
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:16,940

683
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:19,740

684
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,540

685
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:25,880

686
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,750

687
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:30,550
Don't stop, little--

688
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:32,210
- Yeah?
- Betty!

689
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,690
I need your help.

690
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,210
Tim, what's wrong?

691
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,230
Uh, uh, well, Tonya said
if I ever needed--

692
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:40,790
you know-- oh, uh, well, if any--
if I saw anything weird.

693
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:43,460
It's Alvey. It's Alvey.
It was Alvey. See?

694
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,970
He was--
he was bouncing

695
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,030
and he-- he did the Woody laugh,
you know...

696
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,870
And he was singing.

697
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:54,270
Well, lots of babies
his age sing.

698
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:56,750
Vaudeville?

699
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,940
Okay, I'll show you.

700
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,210
Okay, okay.
Here we go.

701
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:05,280
Go on. Sing.

702
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:09,450
Go on, Alvey.

703
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:12,990
Do it.

704
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:15,960
Do it.
Sing, damn it!

705
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,970
- Sing--
- Tim!

706
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,870
- He's a baby.
- Exactly my point.

707
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:35,550
I'm here to unclog
your throne.

708
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,990
Oh, Jason Kemperbee,

709
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:44,120
be my baby.

710
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:46,860
Come on.

711
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:50,330
Hook me up.
Show me the magic.

712
00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:00,140
Alvey.

713
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,840
Put that down.

714
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,310
That's Mommy
and Daddy's.

715
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:07,110
Please put the fax
machine down.

716
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:15,810
Want some juice?
Here, want some juice?

717
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,290
It's okay. Here you go, Alvey.
Have some juice.

718
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:20,160
Yeah, you like juice.

719
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,230
See, Alvey?
Daddy's not gonna hurt you.

720
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:26,290
Whoa! Hey!
Hey! Hey!

721
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:28,800
No! Hey! Hey! Ah!

722
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,670
Hey! Hey! Hey!

723
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:34,730
Bam! Bam! Bam!
Bam! Bam!

724
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,080
Rattle.

725
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:22,850
Aww, poor baby.

726
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:30,520
Huh? Oh!

727
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,870
Uh-oh.

728
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:03,910

729
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:06,580

730
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:08,680

731
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,320

732
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,830

733
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:16,120

734
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,560

735
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,570

736
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,260

737
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,270

738
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:27,270

739
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:29,800

740
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,540

741
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,590
- Yes?
- Hi!

742
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:48,750
Would you like
some Thin Chocolate?

743
00:50:57,270 --> 00:50:59,260
Yeah, you can run,
but you can't hide!

744
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,370
Transformers.

745
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:09,880
Alvey?

746
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,210
You-- you wouldn't do that
to Da-da, would you?

747
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:14,220
I'm your dad.

748
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:16,550
C-can you say "dad"?

749
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:19,560
"Da-da"?

750
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,690
Madre.

751
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:27,700
This is too much
too handle.

752
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:29,700
I mean,
this is insanity.

753
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:31,730
Dancing?

754
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:42,670
No. No.

755
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,280
Shh.

756
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:56,620
Fire!

757
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,630
Bull's-eye!

758
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:06,840
Hmm?

759
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:12,610
Here we are
by the baby.

760
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:37,330
Oh, yeah.
Who's the dog?

761
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:39,340
Who's the big dog--

762
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:55,650
Whoa!

763
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,270
Mommy!

764
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:25,530
I surrender.

765
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,720
Bye-bye.

766
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:58,080
Oh, shoot.

767
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:05,040
Oh!

768
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:13,920
Stop it!

769
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,430
This is insane!

770
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:18,450
Point it down!

771
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,070
- All done?
- Hmm.

772
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:48,390
- Hey, I'm Rod.
- Get in here!

773
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:50,450
Okay.

774
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,730
Uh, take a look at this.

775
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:55,960
Hey, what a cute
little baby.

776
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,060
- Oh, of course!
- Mind if I take a look at him?

777
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:00,100
No, go ahead.
I don't care.

778
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:03,640
Come on.
Do something crazy.

779
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,610
Yeah, do
something crazy!

780
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:08,910
Crap! Huh-uh, huh-uh.

781
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:10,940
Damn it. This isn't
the right one either.

782
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:14,850
Hey!
What are you doing?

783
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:16,880
Uh, I left your package
in the foyer.

784
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:23,190
Do I have a package? Okay.

785
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:33,140
Oh well.

786
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:38,570
What happened?

787
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:43,070
You did this to me.
I know what you're doing.

788
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:46,810
You're trying
to drive me crazy.

789
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:48,510
You're a cunning
little mastermind

790
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:51,220
who will stop at
nothing until I go

791
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:53,250
completely insane.

792
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:57,030
Well, come on.

793
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:59,730
Start dancing again.

794
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,960
Start screwing
with my mind!

795
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,490
Start, huh?
Come on!

796
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:13,910
Why aren't you
screwing with my mind?

797
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:19,920
Maybe I am
just going crazy.

798
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:21,920
Maybe I am just
going crazy.

799
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,620
Maybe I am
just going crazy.

800
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:26,630
Maybe I am just going crazy.

801
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:30,190
Maybe I am
just going--

802
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:51,040
That's it, buddy.
First I'm taking you to a pediatrician,

803
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:53,080
then I'm taking you
to an exorcist.

804
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:06,460
Who are you?!

805
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,470
Oh my G--

806
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,730
my son is the devil.
My son is the devil.

807
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:14,830
Oh my Odin,
it is him.

808
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,610
We're just going to have
a nice little drive,

809
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:21,640
while Daddy has
a nervous breakdown.

810
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,620
Please leave a message.

811
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:28,050
Tonya, it's Betty.
You said I should keep an eye out

812
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:30,020
and call you if there
are any problems?

813
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:31,790
I think there's a problem.

814
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:48,140
No parking there.

815
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:51,230
That's a handicapped zone!

816
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,210
Hey! Sir?

817
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,980
Hey, wait!

818
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:03,110
Stop! You!

819
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:06,390
Hey!

820
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:10,200
What is it?

821
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:13,330
- Ah!
- Okay, where is the mask?

822
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:15,860
- What?
- The mask. My mask. Where is it?

823
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,530
What are you talking
about? Who are you?

824
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:19,230
I am Loki, God of Mischief.

825
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:21,970
Yeah, and I'm Tim, God of Crazy
Babyland. Will you get out of the way?

826
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:23,500
That baby is born
of the mask-- my mask.

827
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:25,640
- Now, where is it?!
- Born of the mask-- what?

828
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:30,610
Oh, so that explains why
he could pee like that!

829
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:34,020
But wait a minute.
This is my baby.

830
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:36,650
I don't care about that.
Just give me my mask!

831
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:38,660
- I don't know where it is.
- Oh really?

832
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:40,680
Maybe this will
jog your memory!

833
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:47,290
- Loki!!
- Dad?!

834
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:49,530
I've warned you! You've
left me no other choice.

835
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:52,230
I don't have time for this.
Look, Dad, there's Balder.

836
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:22,230
- Just give me the mask.
- I don't have it.

837
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:26,440
I think my dog ate it.

838
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:29,100
That is the oldest
excuse in the book,

839
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:32,600
and I've read some really,
really old books.

840
01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:36,310
But if you want
to do this the hard way...

841
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:38,650
so be it.

842
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:01,470
Oh, you're good.

843
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,470
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

844
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,680
You really are a chip
off the old block.

845
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:17,450
But I don't have time for this.
Prepare to feel my true power!

846
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:31,360
Loki!

847
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,530
You have defied me

848
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:40,100
for the last time.

849
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:41,770
I've had it up
to here with you!

850
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:44,610
Dad, please listen to me.
You're holding the baby.

851
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:49,310
Silence!
You have left me no choice.

852
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:51,450
- Listen, listen--
- You are hereby stripped

853
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:54,390
of your immortal powers
and forever banished

854
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:56,730
to the land of mortals.

855
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:59,130
No! Please, hear me out.
That baby--

856
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:13,700
Whoa.

857
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,830
- Pretty.
- Whoa.

858
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:37,430
Whoa.

859
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:41,870
- Hello?
- Where the hell are you, homes?

860
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:44,000
Your pitch meeting
is starting right now.

861
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,810
Um, I just met Green.

862
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:49,440
- Loki.
- Snap out of it.

863
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,470
Where are you?
I'll pick you up.

864
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:59,020
What's the deal, Tim?
I get you a network pitch,

865
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:01,190
and you repay me by showing up
20 minutes late

866
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:02,960
Iooking like an escaped
mental patient?

867
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,960
Andwith a kid?

868
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,360
Huh?

869
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,460
This is Tim Avery.

870
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,470
He created
the character,

871
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,970
so why don't I just let him
tell you more about it?

872
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:16,000
Tim?

873
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:24,670
Tim?

874
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,890
Guys, I could walk.

875
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:33,620
I-I guess he didn't
like the pitch.

876
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:37,250
I just--
I wanna get all my stuff.

877
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:40,860
Tim?

878
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,870
Pick up the phone!

879
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:44,870
Tim!

880
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:47,430
Betty just called.
She's completely freaked out!

881
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:50,970
Oh, God. Call me the second
you get this message.

882
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,050
Hey, it's me.

883
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,050
Uh, got your message.

884
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:01,450
Well, things are
really great here.

885
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:04,980
Uh, me and Alvey got chased
by a guy named Loki.

886
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:07,290
Well, that's
not important.

887
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:11,130
I pitched, uh,
my show today,

888
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,130
and, um...

889
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:15,160
I got fired.

890
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,470
Yeah.

891
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:22,470
Um...

892
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:24,480
but Alvey pooped,

893
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:26,500
which is good, and, uh...

894
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:30,740
and Alvey saved me.

895
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:34,340
It was amazing.

896
01:04:34,390 --> 01:04:36,360
But, uh, uh,
the main thing is, uh,

897
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:38,910
we're totally fine.
Everything's great.

898
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,690
Um, better than fine,
actually.

899
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:43,560
Alvey's great.

900
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,560
I love you.

901
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,590
Okay, bye.

902
01:05:00,210 --> 01:05:05,980

903
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:08,420

904
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:13,720

905
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:17,350

906
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:22,600

907
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:31,240

908
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:35,940

909
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:39,580

910
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:45,280

911
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:24,620
Whoa!

912
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:58,630
By Kylvie,
King of Svitjod,

913
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:02,160
Houthedy
and Yppor.

914
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:06,900
I summon thee,
God of Gunningap

915
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,930
- Nifleheim, Kvelge--
- Tim?

916
01:07:12,450 --> 01:07:15,280
Tim? Is that you?

917
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:16,980
Tim!

918
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:25,380
Kvelgemir!

919
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,870
Who summons Odin,

920
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:39,000
- Allfather of the gods?
- Shh!

921
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:41,440
- G-- Loki?!
- Shh!

922
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:43,700
- You'll wake the baby.
- Oh, sorry.

923
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:47,200
Loki, is that you?

924
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:48,870
Tim.

925
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:50,310
What are you doing
in there?

926
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:52,540
You did
the conjuring ceremony

927
01:07:52,590 --> 01:07:54,550
- by yourself?
- I pay attention.

928
01:07:54,590 --> 01:07:57,320
- Sometimes.
- But you don't have the mask.

929
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:00,380
- Well, yeah, that's why l--
- Rules are rules, Loki!!

930
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:02,160
And I specifically-- ow!

931
01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:05,560
Could you just stop lecturing me
for one minute and listen?!

932
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,790
I found the baby.
He's right there.

933
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:11,860
- That child is strong.
- Mmm.

934
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:15,210
Very strong.

935
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:18,540
I had him before.
I was this close,

936
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:20,880
but you took my powers
and they got away.

937
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:22,900
So, please, father,

938
01:08:22,950 --> 01:08:24,920
give me my powers

939
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:27,250
and I will
give you the mask.

940
01:08:31,290 --> 01:08:33,260
Very well.

941
01:08:33,290 --> 01:08:35,730
Your resourcefulness
pleases me,

942
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:38,230
and your mother says
we should be trying

943
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:40,230
"positive reinforcement,"

944
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:42,230
whatever the Helveti
that is.

945
01:08:42,270 --> 01:08:45,200
So, as a reward,

946
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:48,700
I shall grant you
a reprieve.

947
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:51,970
You have until
the sands have fallen.

948
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:53,980
Oh, hey, hey.
Wait, wait. Hang on.

949
01:08:54,010 --> 01:08:55,710
- Hmm?
- I want to sync up.

950
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:58,510
Ready... now!

951
01:09:00,990 --> 01:09:03,890
Don't disappoint me, Loki.
Use your powers wisely

952
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,720
and complete your task.
This truly is

953
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,750
your final chance!

954
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:33,650
Tim.

955
01:09:33,690 --> 01:09:35,680
What's going on
up there?

956
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:39,250
Tim Avery, what are
you doing in there?

957
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,060
Hmm.
Nosy neighbors.

958
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:49,660
Ah--ah--choo!

959
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:10,420
- Guess who?
- No! Ah!

960
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:14,430
Tim, snap out of it!

961
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:16,790
Baby?

962
01:10:16,830 --> 01:10:19,820
- Is that you?
- Of course it's me.

963
01:10:19,870 --> 01:10:21,830
What are you
doing up so late?

964
01:10:21,870 --> 01:10:24,060
- And where's Alvey?
- Seriously.

965
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:26,230
Is that really you?

966
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:28,070
No, you idiot.

967
01:10:28,110 --> 01:10:31,700
Oh God.
Ah-- what-- l--

968
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,450
Oh Jeez.

969
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,450
Bro, listen.

970
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:41,480
I'm a god.
I can shape shift.

971
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,490
I can create stuff
out of nothingness.

972
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,580
I can alter
the fabric of reality,

973
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:49,390
so, please, quit being
a knucklehead.

974
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:52,090
- What do you want from us?
- Oh, don't worry.

975
01:10:52,130 --> 01:10:54,570
I'm not gonna
hurt you...

976
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,570
yet!

977
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,870
This baby was born
out of the mask,

978
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:01,070
and I want
my mask back!

979
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:03,440
Meet me in exactly
one hour.

980
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:12,120
So you find the mask
and meet me at-- hmm.

981
01:11:12,150 --> 01:11:15,610
Where shall we meet?
Um, how about Red Lobster?

982
01:11:15,650 --> 01:11:18,250
It's always so difficult getting a table
there, especially on Fridays

983
01:11:18,290 --> 01:11:20,050
- when they do that special.
- There's a wick burning.

984
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:22,150
Well, how about we meet
in an alley in the city?

985
01:11:22,190 --> 01:11:24,160
- There's a wick--
- Met at one before.

986
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,220
- Sure, it's a little cliche...
- Sir, your--

987
01:11:26,270 --> 01:11:29,260
but it's not so cliche that I think
to myself, "Wow, that's too cliche!"

988
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:32,360
- But-- it-- it--
- Meet me in that alley within the hour,

989
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,270
with the mask,

990
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:37,970
if you ever want to see
your little monster again.

991
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:41,000
No!

992
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:46,910
Alvey! No!

993
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:05,430
What--
Tim?

994
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:09,240
Tim?!

995
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:11,270
Alvey?!

996
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:14,980
Oh God. Tim!

997
01:12:15,010 --> 01:12:17,140
What are you--
what are you--

998
01:12:19,690 --> 01:12:21,650
Tim.
What are you doing?

999
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:23,680
What are you doing?

1000
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:30,190
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Get off of me!

1001
01:12:30,230 --> 01:12:33,960
Get out of there, Loki!
Where's my son, you mongrel from hell?

1002
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:43,200
Tim! Ah!

1003
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,230
Tonya?!

1004
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:51,410
Tonya!
Oh, it's really you.

1005
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:54,110
- Oh my God.
- Oh God, I'm so sorry.

1006
01:12:54,150 --> 01:12:56,950
Betty was right.
You have gone crazy.

1007
01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:59,890
No, I haven't.
I thought I did, but I didn't.

1008
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:03,280
Where's Alvey?

1009
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,460
- Okay, don't freak out.
- Where's Alvey?!

1010
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,400
- You're freaking out.
- Where's my baby?!

1011
01:13:08,430 --> 01:13:10,400
- Loki t-took him.
- Took him?!

1012
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:12,400
Oh my God.
Did you call the police?!

1013
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:14,430
- No, l--
- Oh my God.

1014
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:17,910
Tonya, listen!

1015
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:19,910
- This is an emergency!
- Tonya!!

1016
01:13:19,950 --> 01:13:22,680
- My son is missing--
- No, Tonya, listen!

1017
01:13:22,710 --> 01:13:25,580
The police can't help us!
He's the freaking God of Mischief.

1018
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:28,210
All he wants is his mask,
which Otis is wearing.

1019
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:31,520
And if I can just figure
out where Otis is, I can just--

1020
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:33,530
of course!

1021
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:37,020
Our child is missing and you're worried
about the damned dog?!

1022
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:39,190
This is crazy!

1023
01:13:39,230 --> 01:13:40,700
See what I'm
talking about?

1024
01:13:40,730 --> 01:13:42,600
Now, you're gonna
have to trust me

1025
01:13:42,630 --> 01:13:46,260
and get in the car, because I know where
Alvey is and I know how to get him back,

1026
01:13:46,310 --> 01:13:48,270
because I know the one place
Otis the moose would go.

1027
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:50,280

1028
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:53,680

1029
01:13:55,350 --> 01:13:58,110

1030
01:14:02,290 --> 01:14:04,260
See there's this really
cute pooch Venus.

1031
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:06,020
Otis?

1032
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:08,390
Otis!

1033
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:11,260
That's not Otis!
That's a green critter.

1034
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:13,260
I'm sorry, okay?

1035
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:16,030
I've ignored you
and I've been impatient,

1036
01:14:16,070 --> 01:14:19,300
but I need you, buddy.
Loki, that guy that made the mask?

1037
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:21,310
He wants it back.
He has Alvey.

1038
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:23,310
And he's a bad guy,
Otis.

1039
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:25,810
He hates dogs.

1040
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,470
He doesn't realize that dogs
are truly man's best friend.

1041
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:30,480
- Huh?
- You heard me.

1042
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,920
You're this man's
best friend.

1043
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:35,440
But Alvey's my son

1044
01:14:35,490 --> 01:14:37,980
which sort of makes you
like his big brother.

1045
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:41,360
And when he grows up,
he's gonna be your bestest friend.

1046
01:14:42,630 --> 01:14:44,600
But right now,
he needs you

1047
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:47,460
and he needs that mask.

1048
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:53,090
All right.

1049
01:15:01,810 --> 01:15:03,940
So, I guess you're

1050
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:05,970
kinda cute, huh?

1051
01:15:07,850 --> 01:15:09,820
Um, can you, like,

1052
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:11,820
do anything you want,
like me?

1053
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:13,850
I mean, can you
do this?

1054
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:21,160
Wow.

1055
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:23,170
Well, look at you!

1056
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:25,170
You're just a little
outlaw, ain't you?

1057
01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:37,550
Okay, hombre. Let's see how tough
your rawhide can be.

1058
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:57,660
Gotcha.

1059
01:16:02,910 --> 01:16:05,210
I like it!

1060
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:07,870
So, you like games, huh?

1061
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:09,880
Well you'd better watch out

1062
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:12,680
'cause I've got a game
that no one can beat me at.

1063
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:16,280
Super Twister!

1064
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:20,090
It's just around
the corner, right here.

1065
01:16:20,130 --> 01:16:22,090
Here we go.

1066
01:16:22,130 --> 01:16:24,960

1067
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,990

1068
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:30,800

1069
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:32,800

1070
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,810

1071
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,810
Isn't this fun?

1072
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,830

1073
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:43,310

1074
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:45,110

1075
01:16:45,150 --> 01:16:49,850

1076
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:52,450

1077
01:16:52,490 --> 01:16:55,520

1078
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:59,360

1079
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:01,800

1080
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:06,330
Whoa!

1081
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:08,360
Whoa!

1082
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:15,440
No fair! That crash
threw me. Rematch!

1083
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:26,750
Okay, you give me Alvey,

1084
01:17:26,790 --> 01:17:28,620
and the mask is yours.

1085
01:17:45,310 --> 01:17:47,340
I can't let go.
I've grown attached.

1086
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:49,350
- Alvey!
- Hey, we had a deal!

1087
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:52,150
I'm the God of friggin' Mischief,
what did you expect?

1088
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,250
- Huh.
- Hey, Loki.

1089
01:18:27,290 --> 01:18:29,280
Honey, you look hot.

1090
01:18:30,290 --> 01:18:32,550
Give me back my son!

1091
01:18:32,590 --> 01:18:34,580
Um... no.

1092
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:39,790
Honey, I think
it's time we trade up.

1093
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,780
Buckle up, baby.

1094
01:19:08,230 --> 01:19:10,190
Listen to Loki, kid.

1095
01:19:10,230 --> 01:19:13,930
Dads are overrated
and I speak from experience.

1096
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:18,570
Ah, there's nothing
like a Sunday drive.

1097
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:22,910
You wanna have some fun,
kid, you stick with me.

1098
01:19:35,550 --> 01:19:38,080
All right. It's time
to lose them for good.

1099
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,900
Oh, look out,
look out, look out!

1100
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:51,960
Yahoo!

1101
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:02,650
Whoa!!

1102
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:07,320
Hey, babe, look.
No hands. I'm kidding.

1103
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:08,980
Let's just
finish this.

1104
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:15,150
Now, where did he go?

1105
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:18,160
- Hmm.
- Uh, honey?

1106
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,430
I think, maybe, there?

1107
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:38,910
And here he is,folks,

1108
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:42,180
the failure of Fringe City,

1109
01:20:42,220 --> 01:20:47,490
Yes, it's
Tim "No-win" Avery!

1110
01:20:47,530 --> 01:20:50,220
Tim, it's Alvey.
I'm gonna go get him.

1111
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:52,250
Kick his can, honey.

1112
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:09,810
Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.

1113
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:14,810
Hi, baby.
Hi, baby. Hi, baby.

1114
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:18,350
Oh, yeah? Well, jump
like a grasshopper

1115
01:21:18,390 --> 01:21:20,980
and stink like a skunk!

1116
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:24,490
Caught me
with my mouth open!

1117
01:21:24,530 --> 01:21:26,790
You can't fight me
if you're locked in a trunk.

1118
01:21:26,830 --> 01:21:28,320
Huh?

1119
01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:35,040
I'm coming, I'm coming.

1120
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:48,450
Let's get out of this dump.
Come on.

1121
01:21:48,490 --> 01:21:51,650
And Loki said, "Let there
be a brick wall!"

1122
01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:54,390
And there was!

1123
01:21:55,690 --> 01:21:57,490
Okay!

1124
01:21:57,530 --> 01:22:00,360
No more Mr. Nice Guy!

1125
01:22:02,930 --> 01:22:05,900
Say hello to my
little friend!

1126
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:14,210
Tim! Tim!

1127
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:23,050
Here's Loki!

1128
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:29,420
Tim, Tim, Tim, Tim,
T-T-T-T-T--

1129
01:22:42,470 --> 01:22:44,270
Wait.

1130
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:45,780
This is a waste
of time.

1131
01:22:45,810 --> 01:22:48,040
We're evenly-matched
opponents.

1132
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:52,370
I think we should
let the kid decide.

1133
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,990
Why, that's
a swell idea.

1134
01:23:02,830 --> 01:23:05,960
Alvey, this is
your decision.

1135
01:23:06,970 --> 01:23:09,090
- Pick me, pick me!
- Alvey?

1136
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:14,070
- I'm your real dad!
- Come on, you little devil. Let's play!

1137
01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:17,230
- Come on, Alvey.
- Alvey.

1138
01:23:23,450 --> 01:23:24,780
Alvey?

1139
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:27,550
- Yeah, that's right.
- Tim!

1140
01:23:27,590 --> 01:23:30,250
Son.

1141
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:48,760
Alvey,
look at me.

1142
01:23:48,810 --> 01:23:51,070
It's your dad.

1143
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:53,010
There's no more
superpowers.

1144
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:56,300
I know at first
I was kind of a jerk.

1145
01:23:58,020 --> 01:24:00,680
I didn't know
how to handle a son,

1146
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:03,450
but you helped me
grow up.

1147
01:24:03,490 --> 01:24:05,620
And I want
to repay you

1148
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:07,650
by helping you
grow up.

1149
01:24:09,390 --> 01:24:11,230
I love you.

1150
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:17,060
Come on.

1151
01:24:21,470 --> 01:24:24,410
- Da-da.
- Oh, Alvey.

1152
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:26,930
It's my son.

1153
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:31,220
Yes.

1154
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:37,280
I just wanted
a friend.

1155
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:24,090
Push! Push!

1156
01:25:39,180 --> 01:25:40,910
Huh?

1157
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:18,290
Off the throne.
He's off the throne. That's not good.

1158
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,090
Your time is up, son.

1159
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:23,620
As expected, you failed
in your promise.

1160
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:25,630
You failed in your quest.

1161
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:29,720
You are, in every sense
of the word,

1162
01:26:29,770 --> 01:26:32,500
- a failure.
- And I thought your dad was mean.

1163
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:34,510
Hey, we both knew
it would end like this, right?

1164
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:37,100
You always set me up to fail.
At least in that respect,

1165
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:39,700
- I'm living up to your expectations.
- Silence!

1166
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:42,980
You've brought me
much pain, Loki.

1167
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:48,040
Right back
at you, Dad.

1168
01:26:48,090 --> 01:26:49,850
- Hey!
- Tim, no!

1169
01:26:49,890 --> 01:26:52,220
Hang on just a minute,
Grizzly Adams.

1170
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:54,950
I don't know how things work
in the god world,

1171
01:26:54,990 --> 01:26:58,390
but you're his father,
he's your son.

1172
01:26:58,430 --> 01:27:01,630
And even if you banish him,
he's still gonna be your son.

1173
01:27:03,070 --> 01:27:07,500
There is nothing more important
in this entire universe

1174
01:27:07,540 --> 01:27:09,940
than your relationship
with your family,

1175
01:27:09,970 --> 01:27:11,640
especially
if you're immortal.

1176
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:14,140
You're like 1,000,
he's like 800,

1177
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:15,910
so you might as well
get things right now

1178
01:27:15,950 --> 01:27:18,470
and enjoy the rest
of your eternal life.

1179
01:27:19,550 --> 01:27:22,180
Here's the thing.
Just take it.

1180
01:27:26,090 --> 01:27:29,030
Okay?
Loosen up.

1181
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:47,170
Come on, son.
Let's go home.

1182
01:27:47,210 --> 01:27:49,150
- Okay?
- Okay.

1183
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:52,610
Godspeed.

1184
01:27:57,390 --> 01:28:00,360
Maybe now, I can help you
patch things up with Mom?

1185
01:28:00,390 --> 01:28:02,120
Don't push it.

1186
01:28:18,180 --> 01:28:21,480
A baby and a dog competing
for Dad's attention--

1187
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:23,810
I love it.

1188
01:28:23,850 --> 01:28:27,580
Simple, but it's--
it's got--

1189
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:30,640
- Spark?
- Yes.

1190
01:28:30,690 --> 01:28:32,920
Where did you
get the idea?

1191
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:37,860
Well, I just kind of quit
trying so hard and...

1192
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,490
the idea just
came to me.

1193
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:44,830
It's great.

1194
01:29:14,830 --> 01:29:16,860
Yay! Yay!

1195
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:18,990
Honey, oh.

1196
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:22,130
That was such
a good show!

1197
01:29:22,170 --> 01:29:25,870
But I think you might
need to add another character.

1198
01:29:25,910 --> 01:29:27,570
What?

1199
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:33,210
- Really?
- Yeah.

1200
01:29:37,890 --> 01:29:40,190
What do you think about that,
Double A?

1201
01:29:40,220 --> 01:29:42,250
A little brother
or sister?

1202
01:29:42,290 --> 01:29:44,190
How does
that sound?

1203
01:30:05,850 --> 01:30:09,720

1204
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:13,820

1205
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:16,520

1206
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:20,430

1207
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:24,160

1208
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:28,330

1209
01:30:30,140 --> 01:30:34,870

1210
01:30:34,910 --> 01:30:40,080

1211
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:44,250

1212
01:30:44,290 --> 01:30:49,120

1213
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:53,820

1214
01:30:53,870 --> 01:30:58,930

1215
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:03,870

1216
01:31:03,910 --> 01:31:07,870

1217
01:31:07,910 --> 01:31:10,610

1218
01:31:10,650 --> 01:31:14,380

1219
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:18,180

1220
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:23,060

1221
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:36,070

1222
01:31:36,110 --> 01:31:38,580

1223
01:31:38,610 --> 01:31:42,880

1224
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:48,650

1225
01:31:48,690 --> 01:31:52,780

1226
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:55,490

1227
01:31:55,530 --> 01:31:59,460

1228
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:03,330

1229
01:32:03,370 --> 01:32:07,570

1230
01:32:10,910 --> 01:32:15,610

1231
01:32:17,820 --> 01:32:19,370

1232
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:21,480

1233
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:23,950

1234
01:32:27,730 --> 01:32:29,090

1235
01:32:29,130 --> 01:32:32,030

1236
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:34,930

1237
01:32:34,970 --> 01:32:38,090

1238
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:41,070

1239
01:32:41,110 --> 01:32:42,600

1240
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:44,400

1241
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:47,040

1242
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:50,310

1243
01:32:50,350 --> 01:32:53,410

1244
01:32:53,450 --> 01:32:56,610

1245
01:32:56,650 --> 01:33:00,020

1246
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:02,490

1247
01:33:02,530 --> 01:33:05,120

1248
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:06,560

1249
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:08,590

1250
01:33:08,630 --> 01:33:11,430

1251
01:33:11,470 --> 01:33:14,460

1252
01:33:14,510 --> 01:33:16,100

1253
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:17,900

1254
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:20,930

1255
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:23,850

1256
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:26,910

1257
01:33:26,950 --> 01:33:29,780

1258
01:33:29,820 --> 01:33:32,850

1259
01:33:32,890 --> 01:33:35,920

1260
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:38,830

1261
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:41,860

1262
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:45,100

1263
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:48,260

1264
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:50,870

1265
