You've never seen a dead man before?

00:01:59.525 --> 00:02:00.818
Oh, my God.

8
00:02:02.613 --> 00:02:03.739
He's alive!

00:02:07.744 --> 00:02:09.287
Put a blanket on him. Cover him.

10
00:02:09.371 --> 00:02:10.330
I'm coming.

11
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.750
Be careful.

12
00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:15.336
One minute.
I'll be right there. Cover him.

13
00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.258
Get rid of this stuff.

14
00:02:26.307 --> 00:02:27.518

[in Italian] No, I saved you!
I saved your life.

18
00:04:57.198 --> 00:04:58.366
I'm doing this for you.

19
00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.868

Goddamn it! Where am I?

22
00:05:02.913 --> 00:05:06.626
[in English] A boat! A fishing boat.
You were in the water.

23
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:07.794
We pulled you out.

24
00:05:07.878 --> 00:05:08.879
What water?

25
00:05:09.212 --> 00:05:11.549
You were shot. See? There are the bullets.

26
00:05:13.885 --> 00:05:17.431
Look, there is a number for a bank.
Why was it in your hip?

27
00:05:18.515 --> 00:05:20.393
-My hip?
-Why was it in your hip?

28
00:05:20.477 --> 00:05:22.437
Yeah, in your hip, under the skin.

29
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.646
Oh, God.

30
00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:28.360
You need to rest. Wait. Please. Lie down.

I'm a friend. I'm your friend.

What's your name?

35
00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:42.002
What's your name?

36
00:05:42.711 --> 00:05:43.755
I don't know.

42
00:07:02.433 --> 00:07:04.268
[Bourne, in French] Do you know who I am?

43
00:07:07.188 --> 00:07:08.940
I do not know who I am.

44
00:07:14.573 --> 00:07:16.283
[in Dutch] Tell me who I am.

45
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:20.413
[continues in Dutch] If you know who I am,

46
00:07:21.205 --> 00:07:23.541
please stop messing around

47
00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:25.252

-[Giancarlo] Shut up and eat.

49
00:07:32.886 --> 00:07:34.805
-That's the only thing you can cook?
-Yeah.

50
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.728
[in English] If you want to eat,
you'd better get in there.

51
00:07:39.811 --> 00:07:41.021
[Bourne] You know, based on these charts,

52
00:07:41.104 --> 00:07:43.358
I think I may have been
closer to the coast.

53
00:07:43.608 --> 00:07:46.277
What is this? You tie these knots?

54
00:07:47.278 --> 00:07:50.115
-So, it starts to come back?
-No, it doesn't start to come back.

55
00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:52.994
The knot is like everything else.
I just found the rope and I did it.

56
00:07:53.453 --> 00:07:56.122
Same way I can read, I can write.

57
00:07:56.206 --> 00:07:58.959
I can add, subtract.
I can make coffee. I can shuffle cards.

58
00:07:59.085 --> 00:08:01.462
-I can set up a chessboard.
-Yes, it will come back.

59
00:08:01.545 --> 00:08:04.007
No, it's not coming back, god damn it!
That's the point!

60
00:08:05.384 --> 00:08:07.553
I'm down here looking through this,
all this shit!

61
00:08:07.679 --> 00:08:09.472
For two weeks I'm down here.

62
00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:12.434
It's not working.
I don't even know what to look for.

63
00:08:16.731 --> 00:08:19.818
You need to rest. It will come back.

64
00:08:20.443 --> 00:08:21.987
What if it doesn't come back?

65
00:08:25.282 --> 00:08:28.078
We get in there tomorrow,
I don't even have a name.

66
00:08:59.073 --> 00:09:02.870
It's not much,
but it should get you to Switzerland.

Can't you read the signs?

00:10:50.292 --> 00:10:52.711
[officer 2, in German]
On your feet. Let's go, right now.

72
00:10:53.128 --> 00:10:54.129
[officer 1] The park is closed.

73
00:10:54.212 --> 00:10:55.756
There's no sleeping in the park.

74
00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:56.924
[in English] All right.

75
00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.719
[in German] Let's see some identification.

76
00:11:00.679 --> 00:11:01.638
No, I don't...

77
00:11:01.722 --> 00:11:03.056
[officer 1, in German]
Come on. Your papers.

78
00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.059
I don't have any papers. I lost my...

79
00:11:05.143 --> 00:11:07.145
[in German] I've lost them.
My papers, they are lost.

80
00:11:10.649 --> 00:11:12.693
[in German] Okay.
Let's go. Put your hands up.

81
00:11:14.194 --> 00:11:15.322
[in German] I just need to sleep.

85
00:11:37.723 --> 00:11:41.394
These people have threatened
my family, my babies.

86
00:11:41.936 --> 00:11:44.273
So, I'm telling you,
when the evidence is clear,

87
00:11:44.398 --> 00:11:46.525
I will have a nice story
for you to read about.

88
00:11:47.068 --> 00:11:49.821
And all my friends out there,
you will read about yourselves.

89
00:11:50.405 --> 00:11:51.948
'Cause if you want to play this game

90
00:11:52.032 --> 00:11:55.036
after I have been reasonable,
I will show you.

91
00:11:55.703 --> 00:11:58.916
That's Nykwana Wombosi speaking in Paris
the day before yesterday.

92
00:11:59.708 --> 00:12:01.669
He was an irritation before he took power,

93
00:12:01.752 --> 00:12:05.131
he was a problem when he was in power,
and he's been a disaster for us in exile.

94
00:12:06.174 --> 00:12:08.594
He's writing a book
about the Agency's history in Africa.

95
00:12:08.678 --> 00:12:09.720
He's going to name names.

96
00:12:10.304 --> 00:12:12.724
It's basically a shakedown.
He's demanding the Agency's help.

97
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.938
He wants us to put him back in power
in six months, or else.

98
00:12:17.647 --> 00:12:20.692
This interview, and I'll make the tape
available to anyone who wants it,

99
00:12:20.942 --> 00:12:22.695
he goes on to claim
that he's just survived

100
00:12:22.778 --> 00:12:24.029
an assassination attempt.

101
00:12:25.364 --> 00:12:27.909
He says it's us. He says he's got proof.

102
00:12:29.619 --> 00:12:32.081
The director wants to know
if there's any possible shred of truth

103
00:12:32.164 --> 00:12:33.416
in this accusation.

104
00:12:34.583 --> 00:12:36.837
I've already assured him
there's nobody that reckless

105
00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.338
on my senior staff.

106
00:12:45.179 --> 00:12:47.766
I was recalling a conversation
we had some time ago.

107
00:12:48.392 --> 00:12:49.727
Talking about Treadstone.

108
00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:54.065
I seem to remember
Nykwana Wombosi's name might have come up.

109
00:12:55.151 --> 00:12:57.027
I'm not sure what we're talking about.

110
00:12:57.111 --> 00:12:58.821
Someone tried to take him out.

111
00:12:59.906 --> 00:13:01.992
Tried and failed.

112
00:13:02.868 --> 00:13:04.244
Was this Treadstone?

113
00:13:05.621 --> 00:13:07.415
You're asking me a direct question?

114
00:13:08.666 --> 00:13:09.710
Yes.

115
00:13:10.502 --> 00:13:13.172
-I thought you were never gonna do that.
-What happened?

116
00:13:15.175 --> 00:13:20.473
Well, we lost communication with our man.

117
00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:22.475
This was almost two weeks ago.

118
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.686
We've been working
around the clock, the whole unit.

119
00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:28.190
We've been sleeping down there.
Believe me, we're doing everything we can.

120
00:13:28.356 --> 00:13:29.817
And you don't let me know this?

121
00:13:30.568 --> 00:13:32.195
You never wanted to before.

122
00:13:32.278 --> 00:13:34.281

00:18:02.897 --> 00:18:06.818
[in German] I'm trying to think,
how long's it been since I was here last?

135
00:18:07.069 --> 00:18:10.656
[in German] I'm not sure,
it must be three weeks.

Do you have the number for a Jason Bourne?

00:18:31.432 --> 00:18:33.434
[female operator] Yes, sir.
Would you like me to connect you?

This was my current address

00:20:09.424 --> 00:20:13.388
when I started standing in line outside.
Now I lose my apartment, okay?

156
00:20:13.513 --> 00:20:16.559
That means no address, no phone,
no money, no time.

-And I still have no visa!

Hang on, I have it right here.
Just look at it.

00:20:36.207 --> 00:20:40.253
[clerk] You staged an effort to circumvent
the immigration laws of the United States.

This is a student visa now.
It's not about a green card anymore.

It's completely different.

169
00:20:45.385 --> 00:20:48.430
It's not a menu, Miss Kreutz.
You don't just pick what you want.

00:34:28.545 --> 00:34:29.963
I mean, you were shot.

341
00:34:30.255 --> 00:34:33.926
People do all kinds of weird
and amazing stuff when they are scared.

342
00:34:40.393 --> 00:34:43.730
I can tell you the license plate numbers
of all six cars outside.

343
00:34:44.772 --> 00:34:46.859
I can tell you
that our waitress is left-handed,

344
00:34:46.942 --> 00:34:49.738
and the guy sitting up
at the counter weighs 215 pounds

345
00:34:49.821 --> 00:34:51.114
and knows how to handle himself.

346
00:34:51.323 --> 00:34:54.869
I know the best place to look for a gun
is the cab of the gray truck outside.

347
00:34:54.952 --> 00:34:56.078
And at this altitude,

348
00:34:56.162 --> 00:34:59.750
I can run flat out for a half-mile
before my hands start shaking.

349
00:35:02.711 --> 00:35:04.088
Now, why would I know that?

350
00:35:08.343 --> 00:35:10.596
How can I know that and not know who I am?

351
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:53.272
Hey.

352
00:35:55.983 --> 00:35:57.194
I slept.

353
00:35:59.488 --> 00:36:01.950
-I can't believe it.
-Yeah, well, you were tired.

354
00:36:02.033 --> 00:36:03.201
I haven't slept.

355
00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:06.539
Oh, here. For $20,000,
I like to throw in breakfast.

356
00:36:08.666 --> 00:36:10.167

00:36:20.346 --> 00:36:23.851
So, do you think there's,
like, a family waiting for you?

361
00:36:26.229 --> 00:36:27.355
I don't know.

362
00:36:29.107 --> 00:36:30.484
I've thought about it.

363
00:36:39.578 --> 00:36:40.747
[Marie] Is that it?

364

-Just take a left. Pull in over here.

Anytime.

377
00:37:42.571 --> 00:37:45.533
Well, you could come up.
I mean, or you can wait here.

378
00:37:45.658 --> 00:37:47.953
I can go check it out. But you could wait.

379
00:37:48.036 --> 00:37:49.996
-Oh, no, no. No, no.
-You could wait.

380
00:37:50.121 --> 00:37:55.294
Um, with you, you would probably
just forget about me if I stayed here.

381
00:37:57.422 --> 00:37:59.007
How could I forget about you?

382
00:38:00.592 --> 00:38:02.220
You're the only person I know.

00:38:06.934 --> 00:38:08.978

I was wondering, I haven't seen you.

-Yes, sir.

-Thank you.

I have some very bad news for you, sir.

I'm terribly sorry to tell you this,

424
00:42:02.051 --> 00:42:05.847
but Monsieur Kane has passed away
almost two weeks ago.

425
00:42:06.348 --> 00:42:08.433
There was an accident on the motorway.

426
00:42:09.017 --> 00:42:11.229
Apparently, he was killed instantly.

427

to be the one to tell you this.

-Who came?
-His brother.

or a way to get in touch with him?

I'll go try the water in the kitchen.

437

Why don't you just stay in the bathroom?

438

I'll see if I can get it hot.

00:50:26.243 --> 00:50:28.078
You tell them everything
that happened. Everything.

514
00:50:28.162 --> 00:50:30.457
They're gonna believe you.
They have to believe you.

515
00:50:34.294 --> 00:50:37.047
Marie, you can't just sit here.

516
00:50:37.131 --> 00:50:40.635
-It's not safe here.
-Safe? This is from inside the embassy.

517
00:50:40.719 --> 00:50:43.388
-Who can do this? This is from yesterday.
-I don't know.

518
00:50:43.472 --> 00:50:45.016
How can they even know
that we're together?

519
00:50:45.099 --> 00:50:47.268
Look, I'm trying to do
the right thing for you. Okay?

520
00:50:47.351 --> 00:50:48.895
-Just... That's all I'm trying to do.
-Right?

521
00:50:48.978 --> 00:50:51.690
How are you gonna make this right
by sending me there alone?

522
00:50:51.773 --> 00:50:53.317
You think I want you to go to the cops?

523
00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:55.028
-You think that's good for me?
-You want to go, fine.

524
00:50:55.111 --> 00:50:57.322
-If you go to the cops, I gotta run!
-You go and tell them what happened!

525
00:50:57.405 --> 00:50:58.781
I don't know what happened!

526
00:50:58.908 --> 00:51:01.410
I don't know who this guy was!
I don't know about that picture!

527
00:51:01.494 --> 00:51:03.078
I don't know who I am!

528
00:51:05.790 --> 00:51:07.125
[grunts]

529
00:51:10.171 --> 00:51:11.547
Look, I'm...

530
00:51:11.631 --> 00:51:13.132
You're acting like
I'm trying to burn you here.

531
00:51:13.216 --> 00:51:14.510
I'm just trying to do the right thing.

532
00:51:14.593 --> 00:51:16.512
Nobody does the right thing.

533
00:51:24.939 --> 00:51:28.026
Look, I can't run with you. I can't.

534
00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:32.447
We run, I got to live like this. I gotta--

535
00:51:32.532 --> 00:51:34.408
I don't even know who I'm hiding from.

536
00:51:34.784 --> 00:51:36.536
These people know who I am.

537
00:51:36.619 --> 00:51:40.123
Yeah, I gotta stay here.
I got to figure this out.

538
00:51:40.207 --> 00:51:41.542
So, figure it out.

539
00:52:00.273 --> 00:52:01.900
You take care of this car?

540
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:03.485
-[engine starts]
-What do you mean?

541
00:52:03.569 --> 00:52:05.362
The tires felt a little splashy
on the way over here.

542
00:52:06.531 --> 00:52:08.324
It pulls a little to the right.

543
00:52:14.582 --> 00:52:16.668

[gasps]

550
00:53:55.662 --> 00:53:56.747
[Bourne] So...

551
00:53:57.289 --> 00:53:59.333
-What?
-Uh, we got a bump coming up.

552
00:54:02.379 --> 00:54:04.089

[pedestrian shouting]

556
00:54:33.458 --> 00:54:35.753
Turn your head away. Turn your head away.

557
00:54:52.439 --> 00:54:53.440
[groans]

558
00:54:53.523 --> 00:54:55.860

-[pedestrian screams]

[turns off engine]

562
00:56:47.202 --> 00:56:48.996
You can never come back to this car.

563
00:56:49.831 --> 00:56:51.207
-You understand?
-Mm-hmm.

564
00:56:51.458 --> 00:56:55.796
Okay, we're gonna clean it out,
and I'll wipe it down, and we walk away.

565
00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:57.131
-That's it.
-Okay.

566
00:56:57.465 --> 00:56:59.509
Okay. And I'll find
a place for us to rest.

567
00:56:59.593 --> 00:57:01.094
And I got to think.

568
00:57:01.553 --> 00:57:03.430
Do you have a hat,
or a scarf or something?

569
00:57:03.556 --> 00:57:06.017
-For my hair?
-Yeah. Just until we can change it.

570
00:57:06.184 --> 00:57:08.687
-Yeah. Sure. Okay.
-Okay.

Monsieur Kane. Monsieur Kane.

575
00:57:28.628 --> 00:57:30.755
[in French] This is it.

576
00:57:47.359 --> 00:57:48.735
[in English] It's not him.

577
00:57:50.612 --> 00:57:52.448
[in Yoruba]
This man was not shot.

578
00:57:54.242 --> 00:57:55.868
[continues in Yoruba]

579
00:57:58.706 --> 00:57:59.748
[in French] Come on.

582
00:58:13.307 --> 00:58:14.474
[Conklin on phone] What do you have?

583
00:58:14.558 --> 00:58:16.811
[Nicky on phone]
Wombosi went to the morgue.

584
00:58:16.894 --> 00:58:18.688
He saw the body. He didn't buy it.

585
00:58:21.108 --> 00:58:22.401
Where is he now?

586
00:58:22.484 --> 00:58:24.528
[Nicky] I told you,
I'm not staffed for this.

587
00:58:24.611 --> 00:58:27.073
[Conklin] Where is he now?
Right now, where is Wombosi?

588
00:58:27.157 --> 00:58:28.366
[Nicky] They were leaving the morgue.

589
00:58:28.450 --> 00:58:29.743
They just left.

590
00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:39.129
[Zorn] Sir, what do you want to do?

591
00:59:03.408 --> 00:59:05.036
[beeping]

[turns off shower]

594
01:00:37.606 --> 01:00:40.109
I need to get that bottle.

595
01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:57.713
[drops bag]

596
01:02:11.386 --> 01:02:12.470
Hey.

597
01:02:22.941 --> 01:02:25.403
You already cleaned the room?

598
01:02:26.029 --> 01:02:28.990
I wiped the whole place down
for fingerprints.

599
01:02:32.244 --> 01:02:35.957
Can I walk around
or is it gonna leave any footprints?

600
01:02:41.088 --> 01:02:42.131
[chuckles softly]

601
01:02:42.214 --> 01:02:44.843
You can walk around. It's no problem.

602
01:02:46.303 --> 01:02:48.597
But we'll just keep track
of everything we touch.

603
01:02:49.682 --> 01:02:51.517
I just think it's better
if we leave a room,

604
01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:54.396
-that we're not gonna leave a trail.
-Why? Where are we going?

605
01:02:54.521 --> 01:02:56.190
I need to go to the hotel

606
01:02:56.273 --> 01:02:58.818
where John Michael Kane stayed.
The Hotel Regina.

607
01:02:59.611 --> 01:03:03.616
Um, if I was him,
then they're gonna have some records.

608
01:03:04.075 --> 01:03:05.618
We need that hotel bill.

609
01:03:05.951 --> 01:03:06.786
Okay.

610
01:03:07.370 --> 01:03:09.164
It gets slightly complicated, though.

611
01:03:10.874 --> 01:03:12.292
Because you're dead.

612
01:03:14.587 --> 01:03:15.713
Right.

613
01:03:15.963 --> 01:03:17.966

614
01:03:20.469 --> 01:03:21.929
-[man] Sir, please.
-[Wombosi] If they want war,

615
01:03:22.012 --> 01:03:23.515
then we'll give them war.

616
01:03:23.682 --> 01:03:27.060
If they want to kill me,
they better kill me the first time.

617
01:03:27.185 --> 01:03:30.815
They better kill me dead.
They better kill me when I'm in my sleep.

618
01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:33.318
Nykwana, listen to me.
We need these people.

619
01:03:33.402 --> 01:03:35.737
It's hard enough getting people
that we know to help us.

620
01:03:35.987 --> 01:03:37.240
We need to be careful.

621
01:03:37.573 --> 01:03:38.616
We?

622
01:03:39.325 --> 01:03:40.410
No, you.

623
01:03:40.493 --> 01:03:42.955
You need to bring me back
that bastard Kane's head,

624
01:03:43.038 --> 01:03:44.665
put it out in front of this house,

625
01:03:44.748 --> 01:03:46.751
and show them
what kind of war we're fighting!

626
01:03:46.876 --> 01:03:48.503
-But that is precisely--
-[gunshots]

[man yelling in distance]

630
01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:09.528
Let's do a reference check before we go.

631
01:04:11.448 --> 01:04:12.449
Okay.

632
01:04:15.243 --> 01:04:16.912
What's the pay phone number?

633
01:04:17.621 --> 01:04:19.790
616-2468.

634
01:04:20.292 --> 01:04:22.794
-Exits?
-There's three.

635
01:04:22.878 --> 01:04:27.091
Service at the back,
side goes to the street past the shops,

636
01:04:27.592 --> 01:04:28.760
front is the best.

637
01:04:29.343 --> 01:04:33.098
If I think I'm being followed, I walk out
with the bag over my right shoulder.

638
01:04:33.182 --> 01:04:34.601
And if there's no taxi?

639
01:04:35.101 --> 01:04:38.354
I keep on walking,
don't look back until you make contact.

640
01:04:41.776 --> 01:04:42.777
What?

641
01:04:47.324 --> 01:04:48.533
We need this, right?

642
01:04:51.788 --> 01:04:52.622
Okay.

643
01:05:04.762 --> 01:05:06.222
[Bourne] I need distances.

644
01:05:06.388 --> 01:05:09.142
You walk in, you pick a spot.
Some midpoint in the lobby.

645
01:05:09.392 --> 01:05:11.394
I want you to count your steps
to that spot, 

646
01:05:11.478 --> 01:05:12.729
and then remember that number.

647
01:05:12.813 --> 01:05:15.274
Because after I call you,
I can get you moving.

648
01:05:15.358 --> 01:05:16.651
You understand?

649
01:05:17.443 --> 01:05:18.821
I also need a head count.

650
01:05:18.946 --> 01:05:20.531
How many people from the time you walk in

651
01:05:20.614 --> 01:05:23.451
until you get to the desk.
How many hotel employees are there?

652
01:05:23.535 --> 01:05:24.869
And, obviously, security.

653
01:05:24.994 --> 01:05:27.247
And it might not be that easy
to see who they are.

654
01:05:27.373 --> 01:05:30.084
So I'll call you, you give me the layout,
and we'll take it from there.

655
01:05:35.298 --> 01:05:36.508
[female operator] Hotel Regina.

656
01:05:36.591 --> 01:05:38.344
[in French]
Yes, the house phone in the lobby.

657
01:05:39.762 --> 01:05:41.305
[line ringing]

658
01:05:51.527 --> 01:05:52.444
[knocking]

659
01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.785
-What happened?
-Uh--

660
01:05:58.869 --> 01:06:02.081
-Did something go wrong? What--
-I've got the records.

661
01:06:04.083 --> 01:06:06.128
This guy at the front desk
was smiling at me.

662
01:06:06.211 --> 01:06:10.132
So I thought, you know, all this trouble,
maybe it's easier to just ask for them.

663
01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:13.428
-You have the bill?
-He made me a photocopy.

664
01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:16.390
You just asked for it?

665
01:06:17.975 --> 01:06:21.104
I said I was Mr. Kane's
personal assistant.

666
01:06:23.023 --> 01:06:24.149
Oh.

667
01:06:25.276 --> 01:06:28.154
-[Marie chuckles]
-Okay. Good thinking.

668
01:06:37.749 --> 01:06:39.627
-[Zorn] Sir, can I--
-No.

669
01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:46.885
Wombosi was assassinated
in his house in the middle of Paris.

670
01:06:47.886 --> 01:06:49.055
Yeah, we just heard.

671
01:06:50.264 --> 01:06:53.059
It's him. It's Bourne.
We're almost positive.

672
01:06:53.601 --> 01:06:55.520
He had an assignment. He failed.

673
01:06:55.938 --> 01:06:58.065
He obviously felt compelled
to finish the task.

674
01:06:58.858 --> 01:07:01.569
-Jesus.
-We think he'll come back in now.

675
01:07:02.612 --> 01:07:04.073
I mean, it's routine.

676
01:07:04.156 --> 01:07:05.950
It's like behavioral software.

677
01:07:07.701 --> 01:07:09.412
He's following a protocol.

678
01:07:10.205 --> 01:07:14.669
Now that he's completed the mission,
we think he'll come back in.

679
01:07:15.086 --> 01:07:16.253
They always do.

680
01:07:17.839 --> 01:07:20.258
When? How long till he checks in?

681
01:07:22.637 --> 01:07:23.972
-Twenty-four hours.
-Twenty-four hours?

682
01:07:24.055 --> 01:07:25.306
Yeah, it's usually something like that.

683
01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:29.103
Then what?

684
01:07:30.312 --> 01:07:32.148
I told you we'd clean this up.

685
01:07:32.649 --> 01:07:34.150
It will be clean.

686
01:07:37.822 --> 01:07:38.698
[line ringing]

687
01:07:38.781 --> 01:07:41.075
[Bourne] Yeah, I understand
you're a dive shop,

688
01:07:41.158 --> 01:07:42.869
but where are you located?

689
01:07:43.453 --> 01:07:44.287
Marseilles?

690
01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:47.166
[phone dialing]

691
01:07:56.845 --> 01:07:59.681

{\an8}[turns up volume]

693
01:08:09.526 --> 01:08:11.654
What specifically does
your company supply?

694
01:08:11.738 --> 01:08:14.699
[man] I am sorry. What did you say
your name was, monsieur?

695
01:08:16.368 --> 01:08:18.245
[phone disconnects]

696
01:08:18.412 --> 01:08:20.665
[speaking French]

697
01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:24.711
[in French] You've been here
for three hours,

698
01:08:24.794 --> 01:08:28.049
and you still can't find a print?

699
01:08:35.266 --> 01:08:37.393
-What?
-Paris police found the vehicle.

700
01:08:41.356 --> 01:08:43.192
[beeping]

701
01:08:50.951 --> 01:08:53.079
[Rawlins] You've reached
the office of Simon Rawlins

702
01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:55.624
at Alliance Security, Maritime Division.

703
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:59.337
Paris office hours are
from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.

704
01:08:59.921 --> 01:09:01.506
[Bourne] I got a lead in Paris.

705
01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:04.760
The rest were Marseilles,
and two out in Southampton.

706
01:09:04.843 --> 01:09:07.554
-In Paris? It's what?
-Alliance Security. Simon Rawlins.

707
01:09:07.638 --> 01:09:08.640
I got a machine.

708
01:09:23.116 --> 01:09:24.450
[elevator dings]

709
01:09:31.375 --> 01:09:34.003
[speaking French]

710
01:09:34.129 --> 01:09:35.380
[woman] Mr. Kane?

711
01:09:37.633 --> 01:09:38.843
Mr. Kane!

712
01:09:39.426 --> 01:09:42.305
-How are you?
-I'm good. I'm good. How are you?

713
01:09:46.936 --> 01:09:50.273
Oh, Mr. Kane. Come right in.
Please have a seat.

714
01:09:50.398 --> 01:09:51.441
Thank you.

715
01:09:52.025 --> 01:09:54.403
So, this is the Palmer Johnson tri-deck.

716
01:09:55.737 --> 01:09:58.908
I'm assuming you're still in the market.
It's still the same vessel.

717
01:10:00.368 --> 01:10:01.245
Yes.

718
01:10:11.465 --> 01:10:13.176
[indistinct chatter]

719
01:10:25.316 --> 01:10:26.400
So, I'm Kane.

720
01:10:26.483 --> 01:10:28.444
-Hey. They--
-I just had a meeting as Kane.

721
01:10:28.527 --> 01:10:30.405
-They said--
-No, no. I'm definitely Kane.

722
01:10:30.488 --> 01:10:32.866
I just had a meeting as Kane,
and he knew me as Kane.

723
01:10:32.991 --> 01:10:36.204
So, I'm definitely Bourne.
I'm also just definitely Kane.

724
01:10:36.287 --> 01:10:37.496
This is all just boats.

725
01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:39.458
I got blueprints and cameras,

726
01:10:39.541 --> 01:10:41.501
-and security systems.
-I just found John Michael Kane's body.

727
01:10:43.337 --> 01:10:45.173
In a morgue here in Paris.

728
01:10:45.256 --> 01:10:49.762
But, if you are John Michael Kane,
whose body do they have?

729
01:10:52.264 --> 01:10:54.726
[woman singing in French on radio]

730
01:10:57.604 --> 01:10:59.982
-What was name again?
-[Bourne] Kane.

731
01:11:00.358 --> 01:11:01.609
Kane.

732
01:11:01.692 --> 01:11:02.860
John Michael Kane.

733
01:11:02.985 --> 01:11:05.072
John Michael Kane.

734
01:11:09.786 --> 01:11:12.497
Kane. It's number 121.

735
01:11:14.083 --> 01:11:15.125
I want to see the body.

736
01:11:15.209 --> 01:11:18.088
Our boss could come back.
We are not supposed to do that.

737
01:11:19.714 --> 01:11:21.508
-Come on.
-[sighs]

738
01:11:36.567 --> 01:11:38.404
Is this it? I mean, where is he?

739
01:11:39.488 --> 01:11:40.864
I don't know.

740
01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:43.285
[in French] What's going on?

741
01:11:43.368 --> 01:11:44.828
[in French] This guy's
come to see the American.

742
01:11:44.911 --> 01:11:47.415
-But the body, it's disappeared.
-They came yesterday evening, his brother.

743
01:11:47.498 --> 01:11:48.958
He's not in the register.

744
01:11:49.875 --> 01:11:51.545
[in English] Who are you?
What's going on here?

745
01:11:51.670 --> 01:11:54.381
-Where's the body that goes in here?
-I said someone came last night.

746
01:11:54.464 --> 01:11:55.841
Yeah, I know. Where'd they take the body?

747
01:11:55.924 --> 01:11:57.969
Look, this is not a carnival, okay?

748
01:11:58.052 --> 01:12:00.763
People call, they make an appointment,
and they follow the rules.

749
01:12:01.223 --> 01:12:04.059
Everyone signs in and out.
This is a serious place. Serious work.

750
01:12:04.143 --> 01:12:06.187
It's not just to come in
whenever you like!

751
01:12:06.271 --> 01:12:08.690
You're right. You're right.
We didn't sign in.

752
01:12:08.773 --> 01:12:10.275
-Get the hell out of here.
-Fine, fine.

753
01:12:10.358 --> 01:12:12.111
-No, I'm just gonna go sign in.
-Okay, go.

754
01:12:16.033 --> 01:12:17.159
[Bourne] Is this it?

755
01:12:17.242 --> 01:12:19.619
-Slow down. You can't just take the book.
-This is it, right?

756
01:12:19.703 --> 01:12:22.081
No, it's okay. There's a pencil in here.
All right. That's fine.

757
01:12:22.165 --> 01:12:24.083
Honey, why don't you
go wait outside, all right?

758
01:12:24.167 --> 01:12:25.544
-Here it is. Okay.
-We can't have--

759
01:12:25.627 --> 01:12:26.754
Excuse me! [grunts]

760
01:12:28.672 --> 01:12:30.550
Jason, what just happened in there?

761
01:12:30.633 --> 01:12:31.968
What are you looking for?

762
01:12:32.052 --> 01:12:33.178
Nykwana Wombosi.

763
01:12:34.179 --> 01:12:37.141
Wombosi went to the morgue to visit Kane.

764
01:12:38.017 --> 01:12:39.060
See?

765
01:12:39.394 --> 01:12:40.479
-So?
-So, look.

766
01:12:40.562 --> 01:12:42.564
He's in the Alliance Security brochure.

767
01:12:42.647 --> 01:12:43.899
Same guy.

768
01:12:43.983 --> 01:12:45.485
This guy knows.

769
01:12:47.236 --> 01:12:50.240
-[people chattering]
-[siren blaring]

770
01:12:53.953 --> 01:12:56.956
[woman mourning]

771
01:13:08.262 --> 01:13:10.681
[Marie reading French haltingly]

772
01:13:18.233 --> 01:13:22.780
My French sucks. I can't...
It says something about a boat or...

773
01:13:24.198 --> 01:13:25.950
I don't understand. What does it say?

774
01:13:26.033 --> 01:13:28.829
You read it. Huh? Tell me. What--

775
01:13:30.831 --> 01:13:32.875
It says that
three weeks before he was killed,

776
01:13:32.959 --> 01:13:36.671
Mr. Wombosi told police
that a man came onto his yacht

777
01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:40.008
five miles off the coast of Marseilles,
and tried to kill him.

778
01:13:41.176 --> 01:13:43.096
It says that he chased
the man off the boat

779
01:13:43.179 --> 01:13:44.472
and shot him twice in the back.

780
01:13:46.892 --> 01:13:48.185
It says I'm an assassin.

781
01:14:20.099 --> 01:14:21.767
[siren blaring]

782
01:14:29.026 --> 01:14:30.069
[in French] Stop the car.

783
01:14:31.321 --> 01:14:33.323
[driver, in French]
But we're almost there.

784
01:14:33.406 --> 01:14:34.992
[Bourne] Just right here, this is good.

785
01:14:35.075 --> 01:14:36.118
I said stop.

786
01:14:37.119 --> 01:14:38.496
[Marie] What's going on?

787
01:14:39.831 --> 01:14:40.874
[in French] Well, what's going on?

788
01:14:40.957 --> 01:14:42.709
-[Marie] What the hell are you doing?
-Go.

789
01:14:42.792 --> 01:14:43.793
-What are--
-[Bourne] Go. Go.

790
01:14:43.877 --> 01:14:45.171
[driver, in French] You gave me too much.

791
01:14:45.254 --> 01:14:47.924
-We're blown. Come on.
-Blown? What is "blown"?

792
01:14:48.591 --> 01:14:50.969
[in French] Monsieur,
your change. Your change.

793
01:14:51.595 --> 01:14:53.430
[in French] Sir,
please, you have to leave.

794
01:14:55.016 --> 01:14:56.809
Keep walking. Keep walking.

795
01:14:57.310 --> 01:14:58.604
What do you think
they're doing back there?

796
01:14:58.687 --> 01:15:00.064
They're on to the hotel.

797
01:15:00.147 --> 01:15:02.816
-No. You don't know that.
-Trust me. Just keep walking.

798
01:15:03.652 --> 01:15:05.654
[all clamoring]

799
01:15:18.878 --> 01:15:20.588
[speaking French]

800
01:15:24.635 --> 01:15:27.806
Are you crazy? What are you doing now?

801
01:15:29.349 --> 01:15:30.559
Jason!

802
01:15:31.059 --> 01:15:32.645
This is blown.

803
01:15:40.946 --> 01:15:42.407
-Marie?
-Get away.

804
01:15:42.490 --> 01:15:45.159
-Marie, stop right there. Stop.
-Get away from me. Or what?

805
01:15:45.243 --> 01:15:46.620
-What are you gonna do? Kill me?
-Marie.

806
01:15:46.704 --> 01:15:49.081
-Is that what's next?
-Listen, stay calm. Stay calm.

807
01:15:50.165 --> 01:15:52.669
Whatever we do, we have to do it together.

808
01:15:52.752 --> 01:15:53.795
-We have to be--
-We?

809
01:15:54.379 --> 01:15:55.547
The only thing we had in common

810
01:15:55.630 --> 01:15:57.592
was that neither one of us
knew who you were.

811
01:15:57.675 --> 01:15:59.510
-We've passed that now.
-Marie, listen to me!

812
01:15:59.594 --> 01:16:00.762
The police will find us.

813
01:16:00.846 --> 01:16:02.806
And the people
who took that picture in the embassy,

814
01:16:02.889 --> 01:16:04.933
the people who killed Wombosi,
they're gonna come here,

815
01:16:05.017 --> 01:16:07.186
-and they're gonna kill us.
-The people who you work for.

816
01:16:09.522 --> 01:16:11.275
I will take you wherever you need to go.

817
01:16:11.525 --> 01:16:13.527
I will take you there.
I will leave you there.

818
01:16:13.652 --> 01:16:16.114
You can do whatever you want.
You never have to see me again.

819
01:16:16.197 --> 01:16:19.034
But not here. If we stay here, we die.

820
01:16:27.044 --> 01:16:29.672
Boy, great police work! Really brilliant!

821
01:16:30.506 --> 01:16:33.760
Why don't they just hang out a banner
that says, "Don't come back!"

822
01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:38.807
Jesus Christ! What is
the French word for "stakeout," huh?

823
01:16:43.647 --> 01:16:45.232
[grunts]

824
01:16:46.567 --> 01:16:49.071
Okay, this was 16 minutes ago.

825
01:16:49.821 --> 01:16:51.615
This is our starting point.

826
01:16:51.698 --> 01:16:55.536
-They can't fly. Trains are risky. Nicky?
-[Nicky on phone] Here.

827
01:16:55.620 --> 01:16:59.166
I need to know everything
Paris's finest is doing on this.

828
01:16:59.249 --> 01:17:00.376
I'm on it.

829
01:17:01.752 --> 01:17:04.381
[Abbott] You said 24 hours,
and he's not back.

830
01:17:05.924 --> 01:17:08.678
[Conklin] No. But we got
a good idea where he is.

831
01:17:09.512 --> 01:17:12.014
[Abbott] You've got a black ops agent
who's off the reservation.

832
01:17:12.515 --> 01:17:15.435
He's trashed an American consulate.
He's on the run somewhere in Europe.

833
01:17:15.519 --> 01:17:18.189
You don't know why. I've got to stand
before an oversight committee.

834
01:17:18.272 --> 01:17:19.899
What am I gonna tell them
about Treadstone?

835
01:17:19.982 --> 01:17:21.859
You're worried about a budget meeting?

836
01:17:22.695 --> 01:17:25.823
We don't take care of this,
we don't make it to the men's room.

837
01:17:26.699 --> 01:17:28.535
Now, is that clear enough for you?

838
01:17:29.202 --> 01:17:30.995
We will burn for this.

839
01:17:32.081 --> 01:17:33.874
We will, both of us, burn.

840
01:17:35.668 --> 01:17:37.087
All right, I want two teams.

841
01:17:37.170 --> 01:17:39.339
Daryl, Ray, stay on the grids.

842
01:17:39.756 --> 01:17:41.759
Brian, Harris, Steve,

843
01:17:41.843 --> 01:17:43.636
I want to work on this girl.

844
01:17:43.886 --> 01:17:46.013
Where do we stand
with this residency pattern?

845
01:17:46.097 --> 01:17:48.100
-We started it.
-Get it out.

846
01:17:48.183 --> 01:17:50.185
[line ringing]

847
01:17:51.187 --> 01:17:52.522
[truck passes by]

848
01:17:52.605 --> 01:17:55.358
[man] We cross-referenced numbers
from the grandmother and stepbrother.

849
01:17:55.442 --> 01:17:58.279
Whenever we found convergence,
we took those numbers, back-checked them,

850
01:17:58.404 --> 01:18:00.281
and ran a search merge
with any other data we had on her,

851
01:18:00.364 --> 01:18:01.783
which wasn't much. But--

852
01:18:01.867 --> 01:18:03.410
Pins. These pins.

853

01:33:44.296 --> 01:33:46.173
You mean until you kill me.

1028
01:33:48.009 --> 01:33:50.469
I can't fix this, Jason,
if I don't know what the problem is.

1029
01:33:50.553 --> 01:33:53.098
So, tell me what we're into,
and I'll do the best I can.

1030
01:34:00.189 --> 01:34:01.442
[mouths]

1031
01:34:01.525 --> 01:34:03.736
Why don't you talk to Marie, Jason?

1032
01:34:06.031 --> 01:34:09.576
-Let's ask Marie what she wants to do.
-Actually, I don't think she gives a shit.

1033
01:34:10.286 --> 01:34:11.704
She's dead.

1034
01:34:20.256 --> 01:34:22.300
I'm sorry to hear that.
How did that happen?

1035
01:34:22.925 --> 01:34:24.553
She was slowing me down.

1036
01:34:25.846 --> 01:34:28.599
Jason, listen,
all we've been doing right from--

1037
01:34:28.682 --> 01:34:30.226
Enough. Enough.

1038
01:34:31.227 --> 01:34:33.605
5:30 p.m., Paris.

1039
01:34:33.730 --> 01:34:35.524
Today. Pont Neuf.

1040
01:34:35.608 --> 01:34:38.695
You come alone,
you walk to the middle of that bridge.

1041
01:34:38.779 --> 01:34:40.197
You take off your jacket. Face east.

1042
01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:42.407
-I'll redial this number.
-Jason, wait!

1043
01:34:52.586 --> 01:34:56.549
First flight out. Tell Nicky I'll call
from the car. Tell her to find Picot. Go.

1044
01:35:00.221 --> 01:35:02.808
So, what are we gonna do?

1045
01:35:04.017 --> 01:35:05.852
I told you I'd clean this up.
That's what I'm doing.

1046
01:35:05.936 --> 01:35:07.104
Can you really bring him in?

1047
01:35:08.690 --> 01:35:10.358
I think we're past that, don't you?

1048
01:35:11.442 --> 01:35:12.695
What? Do you have a better idea?

1049
01:35:12.778 --> 01:35:15.489
Well, so far you've given me nothing
but a trail of collateral damage

1050
01:35:15.572 --> 01:35:17.784
from Zurich to Paris.
I don't think I could do much worse.

1051
01:35:17.867 --> 01:35:20.912
Well, why don't you go upstairs
and book a conference room?

1052
01:35:20.995 --> 01:35:22.623
Maybe you can talk him to death.

1053
01:36:40.509 --> 01:36:43.888
[man 1 over earphone] The bus,
the tour bus, second level.

1054
01:36:44.931 --> 01:36:46.766
{\an8}[man 2 over earphone]
Negative on the target.

1055
01:36:49.561 --> 01:36:51.563
-[man 1] Position one?
-[man 3] Negative.

1056
01:36:51.647 --> 01:36:53.358
-[man 1] Position two?
-[man 4] Negative.

1057
01:37:00.282 --> 01:37:01.784
[in French] He just went past me.

1058
01:37:09.001 --> 01:37:10.837

1059
01:37:12.589 --> 01:37:15.384

[cell phone ringing]

1062

[in French] All in position.

1063
01:37:39.621 --> 01:37:42.083
-Jason?
-I told you to come alone.

1064
01:37:42.166 --> 01:37:44.460
I guess that was too complicated.

1065
01:37:44.544 --> 01:37:46.630
So, try this. I'm gone.

1066
01:37:50.426 --> 01:37:51.511
Fuck.

1067
01:37:58.728 --> 01:38:00.147
[Conklin] Get Nicky on the phone.

1068
01:38:07.572 --> 01:38:08.948

[cell vibrating]

1070
01:38:16.541 --> 01:38:17.959
-[Nicky] Yeah?
-[Conklin] How long does it take

1071
01:38:18.043 --> 01:38:19.503
to wipe the room down and get it moved?

1072
01:38:19.587 --> 01:38:21.255
-Get rid of everything?
-Yeah.

1073
01:38:22.673 --> 01:38:24.885
-[Nicky] Two to three hours.
-All right, well, get started.

1074

[bleeping]

1075
01:38:32.518 --> 01:38:35.230
Listen, no breaks.
Two men outside, one in the lobby.

1076
01:38:35.314 --> 01:38:36.315
And keep your eyes open.

1077
01:38:39.653 --> 01:38:41.321
-[man] Keep the truck?
-[Conklin] Yeah, keep the truck.

1078
01:38:41.905 --> 01:38:45.201
I'm gonna close this unit down.
We'll move the gear in the truck.

1079
01:39:02.429 --> 01:39:04.891
[Nicky] They were covering
Spain, Malta, Morocco.

1080
01:39:05.016 --> 01:39:07.060
Yes, all local police radio traffic.

1081
01:39:07.687 --> 01:39:11.315
No, for Northern Europe
we need an authorized directive. Yeah.

1082
01:39:12.275 --> 01:39:15.195
Okay, they're on it. We'll have
a satellite download in 30 minutes.

1083
01:39:25.124 --> 01:39:27.085
[bleeping]

1084

[car alarms blaring]

1087
01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:26.156
Where's your field box?

-[keyboard clacking]
-[beeping]

1089
01:40:31.829 --> 01:40:33.664
-Where's your field box?
-It's right there.

1090
01:40:35.292 --> 01:40:36.960
The whole system's gone haywire.

1091
01:40:38.045 --> 01:40:39.923
That's this window, right here.

1092
01:40:40.924 --> 01:40:43.218
-Dining room window?
-[gun cocks]

1093
01:40:44.261 --> 01:40:45.888
I don't get it.

1094
01:40:47.973 --> 01:40:49.434
Dead. The phones are dead.

1095
01:40:51.937 --> 01:40:53.189
It's Bourne, isn't it?

1096
01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:55.525
Just quiet.

1097
01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:24.685
[thud]

1098
01:41:43.583 --> 01:41:45.334
You move, you die.

1099
01:41:45.961 --> 01:41:47.588
-Bourne...
-Gun down.

1100
01:41:54.262 --> 01:41:55.306
In there.

1101
01:41:57.349 --> 01:41:59.852
-Okay, so what do you want--
-Treadstone.

1102
01:42:01.104 --> 01:42:03.440
You better take a look around.
There's not much left.

1103
01:42:03.565 --> 01:42:06.027
-Are you Treadstone?
-Am I Treadstone? Me?

1104
01:42:06.110 --> 01:42:07.737
What the hell are you talking about?

1105
01:42:08.321 --> 01:42:09.322
He's lost it.

1106
01:42:09.823 --> 01:42:11.950
You better start
filling in the blanks here,

1107
01:42:12.117 --> 01:42:14.161
'cause I thought we were on the same side.

1108
01:42:14.244 --> 01:42:15.455
Whose side is that?

1109
01:42:15.538 --> 01:42:17.248
Boy, you don't know
what you're doing, do you, Jason?

1110
01:42:17.332 --> 01:42:18.791
You don't have a goddamn clue!

1111
01:42:19.793 --> 01:42:20.836
Who am I?

1112
01:42:21.462 --> 01:42:23.255
You're U.S. government property!

1113
01:42:23.422 --> 01:42:26.259
You're a malfunctioning
$30 million weapon!

1114
01:42:27.093 --> 01:42:29.013
You're a total goddamn catastrophe!

1115
01:42:29.180 --> 01:42:31.807
And, by God, if it kills me,
you gotta tell me how this happened.

1116
01:42:31.891 --> 01:42:33.852
-Why are you trying to kill me?
-What happened in Marseilles?

1117
01:42:33.936 --> 01:42:37.689
Why are you trying--
You sent me to kill Wombosi.

1118
01:42:38.106 --> 01:42:41.110
Kill Wombosi?
Yeah, we can do that any time we want.

1119
01:42:41.236 --> 01:42:43.489
I can send Nicky to do that,
for Christ's sake.

1120
01:42:44.156 --> 01:42:46.867
Mr. Wombosi was supposed to be dead
three weeks ago.

1121
01:42:46.951 --> 01:42:50.622
He was supposed to have died in a way
where the only possible explanation was

1122
01:42:50.705 --> 01:42:53.793
that he'd been murdered
by a member of his own entourage.

1123
01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:57.296
I don't send you to kill.
I send you to be invisible.

1124
01:42:57.505 --> 01:43:00.175
I send you because you don't exist.

1125
01:43:00.259 --> 01:43:02.135
Now, I want to know
what happened in Marseilles.

1126
01:43:02.261 --> 01:43:05.431
I don't remember
what happened in Marseilles.

1127
01:43:05.515 --> 01:43:08.018
Bullshit! This is unacceptable, soldier.

1128
01:43:08.102 --> 01:43:09.603
You hear me? You failed!

1129
01:43:09.687 --> 01:43:11.480
-Unacceptable?
-You failed!

1130
01:43:11.563 --> 01:43:13.733
-You failed, and you're gonna tell me why!
-I can't tell you!

1131
01:43:13.817 --> 01:43:16.444
-I don't remember a goddamn thing!
-You brought John Michael Kane to life.

1132
01:43:16.528 --> 01:43:19.490
You put together a meeting with Wombosi.
You found the security company.

1133
01:43:19.615 --> 01:43:21.158
-I don't--
-You broke into the office!

1134
01:43:21.284 --> 01:43:22.828
For Christ's sake,
you're the one who picked

1135
01:43:22.911 --> 01:43:25.080
the yacht as a goddamn strike point!

1136
01:43:32.798 --> 01:43:37.178
You picked the boat.
You picked the day. You tracked the crew.

1137
01:43:37.429 --> 01:43:40.933
The food, the fuel.
You told us where. You told us when.

1138
01:43:41.017 --> 01:43:42.101
[child giggling]

1139
01:43:42.184 --> 01:43:44.353
You hid out on that boat for five days.

1140
01:43:44.979 --> 01:43:47.232
You were in, Jason. You were in!

1141
01:43:47.316 --> 01:43:48.400
It was over!

1142
01:44:39.337 --> 01:44:40.671
[gun fires]

1143
01:44:42.298 --> 01:44:43.384
[gun fires]

1144
01:44:49.766 --> 01:44:51.351
No, you do remember.

1145
01:44:54.563 --> 01:44:55.648
Don't you?

1146
01:45:02.197 --> 01:45:03.825
I don't want to do this anymore.

1147
01:45:05.451 --> 01:45:07.788
I don't think
that's a decision you can make.

1148
01:45:11.041 --> 01:45:13.169
-[grunts, groans]
-[clattering]

1149
01:45:13.253 --> 01:45:15.672
Jason Bourne is dead. Do you hear me?

1150
01:45:16.214 --> 01:45:17.758
He drowned two weeks ago.

1151
01:45:17.842 --> 01:45:20.052
You're gonna go tell them
that Jason Bourne is dead.

1152
01:45:20.136 --> 01:45:21.763
-You understand?
-Where are you gonna go?

1153
01:45:21.888 --> 01:45:23.098
[groans]

1154
01:45:23.181 --> 01:45:25.600
I swear to God,
if I even feel somebody behind me,

1155
01:45:25.725 --> 01:45:28.521
there is no measure to how fast
and how hard I will bring this fight

1156
01:45:28.646 --> 01:45:29.856
to your doorstep.

1157
01:45:30.398 --> 01:45:31.984
I'm on my own side now.

1158
01:45:32.067 --> 01:45:33.944
[radio crackling]

1159
01:45:51.549 --> 01:45:54.010
[creaking]

1160
01:46:25.882 --> 01:46:27.342
[man, in French] My God, what happened?

1161
01:46:27.425 --> 01:46:28.969
[woman, in French]
I don't know, I think he fell.

1162
01:46:29.053 --> 01:46:30.012
[man grunts]

1163
01:46:55.334 --> 01:46:57.796
[footsteps approaching]

1164
01:47:12.230 --> 01:47:13.398
[grunts]

1165
01:49:07.202 --> 01:49:08.245
It's done.

1166
01:49:09.121 --> 01:49:10.372
Shut it down.

1167
01:49:10.455 --> 01:49:11.707
[keyboard clacking]

1168
01:49:48.668 --> 01:49:51.839
[Abbott] The Treadstone Project
has actually already been terminated.

1169
01:49:51.922 --> 01:49:55.050
It was designed primarily
as a sort of advanced game program.

1170
01:49:55.135 --> 01:49:57.721
We'd hoped it might build
into a good training platform.

1171
01:49:57.804 --> 01:50:01.058
But, quite honestly,
for a strictly theoretical exercise,

1172
01:50:01.601 --> 01:50:03.895
the cost-benefit ratio was just too high.

1173
01:50:04.020 --> 01:50:05.731
It's all but decommissioned at this point.

1174
01:50:05.981 --> 01:50:07.691
All right, what's next?

1175
01:50:07.775 --> 01:50:10.195
Okay, this is

1176
01:50:11.821 --> 01:50:12.822
Blackbriar.

1177
01:50:12.906 --> 01:50:16.035
Blackbriar is a joint DOD
communications program

1178
01:50:16.118 --> 01:50:18.245
that we really feel
has good traction to it.

1179
01:50:18.329 --> 01:50:20.165
It's got legs. It'll run and run.

1180
01:50:20.332 --> 01:50:24.587
It combines elements of proactive
and reactive fields of security...

1181
01:51:08.223 --> 01:51:09.349
This your store?

1182
01:51:09.891 --> 01:51:10.934
Yeah.

1183
01:51:12.645 --> 01:51:16.984
It's nice.
It's a little hard to find, but...

1184
01:51:21.321 --> 01:51:22.782
Think I could rent a scooter?

1185
01:51:27.037 --> 01:51:28.247
You have ID?

1186
01:51:30.040 --> 01:51:31.209
Not really.
