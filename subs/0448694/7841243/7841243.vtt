1
00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:03.182
Through the years,
I have been known by many names.

2
00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.894
Diablo Gato.

3
00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:10.106
The Furry Lover.

4
00:01:10.274 --> 00:01:12.275
Chupacabra.

5
00:01:12.443 --> 00:01:14.944
Friskie Two-Times.

6
00:01:15.112 --> 00:01:18.030
And the Ginger Hit Man.

7
00:01:18.198 --> 00:01:22.493
But to most... I
am Puss In Boots!

8
00:01:23.412 --> 00:01:25.163
Outlaw.

9
00:01:58.655 --> 00:02:01.949
I will never forget you...
Margherita.

10
00:02:03.494 --> 00:02:05.453
I mean, Rosa.

11
00:02:05.621 --> 00:02:08.581
Uh, sorry. I think
maybe I should go.

12
00:02:48.038 --> 00:02:50.289
You cannot run forever,

13
00:02:50.457 --> 00:02:53.084
Puss In Boots!

14
00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.052
What can I say?
I was a bad Kitty.

15
00:03:07.558 --> 00:03:12.061
Just a fugitive from the law...
forever running.

16
00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:15.481
Searching for a way
to clear my name.

17
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.820
And I would get that chance...

18
00:03:20.988 --> 00:03:24.574
on this one fateful night.

19
00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:15.875
Here, Kitty, Kitty!

20
00:04:17.628 --> 00:04:21.464
Raoul. Look what the
cat dragged in.

21
00:04:21.632 --> 00:04:24.008
Oh, wait... That is the cat!

22
00:04:28.722 --> 00:04:30.973
One leche, please.

23
00:04:33.602 --> 00:04:38.648
What are you doing here, señor?
Did you lose your ball of yarn?

24
00:04:42.027 --> 00:04:44.904
So funny.

25
00:04:45.072 --> 00:04:47.323
One leche coming up.

26
00:05:01.713 --> 00:05:03.506
I am not looking for trouble.

27
00:05:09.179 --> 00:05:12.682
I am but a humble gato in
search of his next meal.

28
00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:16.018
Perhaps you gentlemen can
help me find a simple score?

29
00:05:16.478 --> 00:05:20.981
The only thing you'll find tonight
is trouble... Puss In Boots.

30
00:05:32.035 --> 00:05:34.620
Well, perhaps if one of
us were to tell the law

31
00:05:34.788 --> 00:05:38.332
that you are in town, we
could split the reward.

32
00:05:48.635 --> 00:05:50.344
You made the cat angry.

33
00:05:50.512 --> 00:05:52.972
You do not want to
make the cat angry!

34
00:05:54.891 --> 00:05:57.768
The Church
of St. Michael has just put up

35
00:05:57.936 --> 00:06:00.396
a Golden statue of the
Virgin of Guadalupe.

36
00:06:00.564 --> 00:06:02.398
I do not steal from churches.

37
00:06:02.566 --> 00:06:05.484
The boys' orphanage has been
donated silver candlesticks,

38
00:06:05.652 --> 00:06:07.278
they would look very
lovely in your home.

39
00:06:07.446 --> 00:06:11.407
- I do not steal from orphans.
- Uh, what about Jack and Jill?

40
00:06:11.575 --> 00:06:14.577
- Shh! Are you crazy?
- The what?

41
00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:24.336
The murderous outlaws Jack and Jill have
gotten their hands on... magic beans.

42
00:06:24.504 --> 00:06:26.964
Do not joke with me
about magic beans!

43
00:06:27.132 --> 00:06:31.635
I searched half my life for
them. They do not exist.

44
00:06:31.803 --> 00:06:34.972
No, cat. We have seen them.

45
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.185
These... are the
beans of legend.

46
00:06:41.772 --> 00:06:45.232
Grows a Vine to the
Land of Giants,

47
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.152
and the Golden Goose.

48
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.904
The Golden Goose...

49
00:06:50.071 --> 00:06:52.990
A heist like this could
set you up for life.

50
00:06:53.158 --> 00:06:54.992
All nine of them.

51
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.286
Show him the Golden eggs.

52
00:06:57.454 --> 00:06:58.829
No!

53
00:06:58.997 --> 00:07:01.791
Please, you have shown enough.

54
00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:06.837
Only a cat with a death wish would
steal the beans from Jack and Jill.

55
00:07:08.548 --> 00:07:13.511
The only wish I have is
to repay an old debt.

56
00:07:13.678 --> 00:07:15.679
And this is my chance.

57
00:07:16.807 --> 00:07:18.182
Now...

58
00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:21.352
where do I find
this Jack and Jill?

59
00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.348
I'm sorry... we have no rooms.

60
00:08:04.396 --> 00:08:06.814
Well, I think one
just opened up.

61
00:08:11.695 --> 00:08:14.405
We'd like a complimentary
continental breakfast.

62
00:08:14.573 --> 00:08:17.950
And don't even think about
skimping on them baby muffins.

63
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.460
We don't have any baby muffins.

64
00:08:33.758 --> 00:08:35.050
You know, Jill...

65
00:08:35.844 --> 00:08:36.927
I been thinking.

66
00:08:37.095 --> 00:08:38.762
Get it out.

67
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:42.641
I, um... Once we're done with
this magic bean business

68
00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:45.519
and got ourselves all them
beautiful Golden eggs...

69
00:08:45.687 --> 00:08:47.730
Mm-hm, go on.

70
00:08:47.898 --> 00:08:51.692
That we cut down on some of
the hijacking and murdering.

71
00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.486
I mean, it's fun and
all, but, uh...

72
00:08:56.781 --> 00:08:58.157
I want a baby.

73
00:09:04.623 --> 00:09:06.373
A baby what, Jack?

74
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:07.958
A baby us, Jill.

75
00:09:08.126 --> 00:09:11.003
We'll raise it wild, like
a squirrel or something.

76
00:09:11.963 --> 00:09:14.757
Holy frijoles!

77
00:09:14.925 --> 00:09:16.759
They do exist.

78
00:09:16.927 --> 00:09:18.969
Ever since you fell down that hill

79
00:09:19.137 --> 00:09:21.347
and broke your crown, you
have been talking crazy.

80
00:09:26.561 --> 00:09:29.355
It couldn't hurt to have
an extra shooter during ambushes.

81
00:09:29.522 --> 00:09:32.733
Maybe I cut too deep...
cut that brain out of your head.

82
00:09:34.069 --> 00:09:37.780
Hey! What gives?

83
00:09:37.948 --> 00:09:40.950
If it's to be a girl,
she'll have your strong...

84
00:09:41.117 --> 00:09:43.160
No! No! No!

85
00:09:43.328 --> 00:09:46.372
You, you, you! You
stop where you are!

86
00:09:46.539 --> 00:09:47.623
I don't know, Jack.

87
00:09:47.791 --> 00:09:50.292
How do I ride and shoot with
a baby slung on my back?

88
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.046
They got them backpacks now.
The way I see it, Jill...

89
00:09:54.714 --> 00:09:56.840
Those beans are mine!

90
00:09:57.008 --> 00:09:59.093
We fall off
this flat Earth one time.

91
00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.761
What better proof of our love...

92
00:10:00.929 --> 00:10:02.721
Me?

93
00:10:03.598 --> 00:10:05.432
You snap me?

94
00:10:07.727 --> 00:10:09.186
You snap me?!

95
00:10:21.992 --> 00:10:24.118
You looking for something?

96
00:10:28.206 --> 00:10:31.041
Uh, no.

97
00:10:31.209 --> 00:10:33.210
No hablo inglﾃｩs.

98
00:10:37.549 --> 00:10:40.509
You are going to pay for this!

99
00:11:12.584 --> 00:11:14.918
No!

100
00:11:21.009 --> 00:11:22.342
Chupacabra!

101
00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.678
Chupacabra! Chupacabra!

102
00:11:24.846 --> 00:11:27.097
- Chupacabra!
- You are a crazy woman!

103
00:12:21.736 --> 00:12:24.321
Those magic beans were my score!

104
00:12:24.489 --> 00:12:27.574
You just cost me a chance at
getting the Golden eggs, Mi amigo.

105
00:12:27.742 --> 00:12:29.535
Put up your Dukes.

106
00:13:09.909 --> 00:13:10.909
Psst!

107
00:13:14.706 --> 00:13:16.081
Very well.

108
00:13:16.249 --> 00:13:18.083
If it is to be a dance fight,

109
00:13:18.251 --> 00:13:21.503
then I will Tuesday-Night-Dance-Fight
you to the death!

110
00:13:42.901 --> 00:13:45.903
How dare you do the
Litter Box at me!

111
00:13:47.238 --> 00:13:48.864
Hello!

112
00:13:54.245 --> 00:13:55.996
Toot-toot!

113
00:14:06.883 --> 00:14:08.467
ﾂ飭 Hey-aa 笙ｪ.

114
00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:13.513
Can you feel me?

115
00:15:15.326 --> 00:15:17.661
Fear me... if you dare.

116
00:15:48.901 --> 00:15:51.862
You hit me in the
head with a guitar?!

117
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:53.613
You are a woman?

118
00:15:59.579 --> 00:16:01.747
Amateur.

119
00:16:02.874 --> 00:16:05.834
Wow!

120
00:16:06.002 --> 00:16:07.627
Seﾃｱorita, wait!

121
00:16:09.881 --> 00:16:14.718
Let me buy you some leche! I
am a lover, not a... fighter.

122
00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:19.973
Hello?

123
00:16:20.141 --> 00:16:23.018
You are hiding from me?

124
00:16:23.186 --> 00:16:25.771
I like to play the games, too.

125
00:16:26.439 --> 00:16:30.984
I sense in you a
kindred spirit, a...

126
00:16:34.155 --> 00:16:36.948
I smell something familiar.

127
00:16:39.535 --> 00:16:41.912
Something... dangerous.

128
00:16:43.122 --> 00:16:44.706
Something...

129
00:16:44.874 --> 00:16:46.541
breakfasty.

130
00:16:47.627 --> 00:16:49.961
It's been a long time, brother.

131
00:16:54.092 --> 00:16:55.550
Maldito huevo.

132
00:16:59.305 --> 00:17:02.974
Humpty Alexander Dumpty.

133
00:17:03.935 --> 00:17:06.019
How dare you show
your face to me.

134
00:17:06.187 --> 00:17:11.566
I know you're angry.
You have every right.

135
00:17:11.734 --> 00:17:13.819
But it is good to see you, Puss.

136
00:17:13.986 --> 00:17:15.946
Are those new boots?

137
00:17:16.114 --> 00:17:20.617
No! They are the same boots I
wore when you betrayed me.

138
00:17:20.785 --> 00:17:23.370
Betrayed you?

139
00:17:23.538 --> 00:17:25.622
You left me cracked in
pieces on a bridge,

140
00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:26.957
surrounded by soldiers!

141
00:17:27.125 --> 00:17:28.458
They wrote a song about it!

142
00:17:28.626 --> 00:17:31.795
And how did we get on that
bridge in the first place?!

143
00:17:31.963 --> 00:17:34.983
Because we were brothers, and brothers
are supposed to look after each other...

144
00:17:35.007 --> 00:17:36.174
Humpty!

145
00:17:38.428 --> 00:17:40.429
Remember why we're here.

146
00:17:41.597 --> 00:17:42.931
I should have known.

147
00:17:43.975 --> 00:17:46.184
I had the magic
beans in my grasp,

148
00:17:46.352 --> 00:17:51.189
and you sent this very attractive
devil woman to interfere.

149
00:17:51.357 --> 00:17:52.941
You are a curse on my life!

150
00:17:53.109 --> 00:17:54.776
Whoa, whoa, wait. Hear me out.
Okay?

151
00:17:54.944 --> 00:17:57.487
Yes, yes, I sent Kitty
to bring you here.

152
00:17:57.655 --> 00:17:59.823
But she is no ordinary thief.

153
00:18:01.534 --> 00:18:03.285
She's Kitty Softpaws.

154
00:18:03.453 --> 00:18:05.620
The softest touch in Spain.

155
00:18:05.788 --> 00:18:08.748
That's a lot of heel for
a guy, don't you think?

156
00:18:13.379 --> 00:18:15.714
Look, with Kitty's skill,
your sword and my brain,

157
00:18:15.882 --> 00:18:17.466
we've got a fighting
chance here.

158
00:18:17.633 --> 00:18:20.469
Puss, come on, you of all people
know that nobody's ever ripped off

159
00:18:20.636 --> 00:18:23.263
the giant's castle and
lived to tell the tale.

160
00:18:23.431 --> 00:18:25.765
You want to survive?
You need a plan.

161
00:18:26.851 --> 00:18:31.229
And I've studied this job my
whole life. You know that.

162
00:18:31.397 --> 00:18:33.523
Let's be honest.

163
00:18:33.691 --> 00:18:36.171
Without me, you don't even know
where to plant the beans, Puss.

164
00:18:37.278 --> 00:18:39.613
But Jack and Jill do.
They're on their way.

165
00:18:41.032 --> 00:18:46.036
We go up the beanstalk outlaws,
and we come down legends.

166
00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:49.748
So what do you say?

167
00:18:50.708 --> 00:18:52.042
Partners?

168
00:18:55.046 --> 00:18:57.714
No. Never again.

169
00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:03.220
I'm sorry, Okay? How long are
you gonna hold a grudge?

170
00:19:03.387 --> 00:19:07.724
It's been seven years!
That's like 35 cat years.

171
00:19:07.892 --> 00:19:11.228
You need me! And I need you.

172
00:19:13.105 --> 00:19:17.359
Puss! You got any idea what they
do to eggs in San Ricardo prison?

173
00:19:21.405 --> 00:19:23.740
I'll tell you this, my friend.

174
00:19:24.909 --> 00:19:26.284
It ain't over easy.

175
00:19:30.748 --> 00:19:34.417
Adiﾃｳs... Humpty Dumpty.

176
00:19:40.716 --> 00:19:42.592
Oh, this is bad. This is bad.

177
00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.803
Don't worry, I'll
take care of it.

178
00:19:44.971 --> 00:19:47.097
I know how to speak meow.

179
00:19:47.431 --> 00:19:49.975
Sad story with
your twisted lies

180
00:19:50.142 --> 00:19:53.061
in your greasy shell that
smells like old ham!

181
00:19:53.229 --> 00:19:55.939
I should crack you open for...

182
00:20:05.741 --> 00:20:08.243
Look what I found.

183
00:20:10.037 --> 00:20:12.289
Someone forgot his money.

184
00:20:15.334 --> 00:20:18.169
Oh, you are dangerous.

185
00:20:18.337 --> 00:20:21.381
Humpty says you like danger.

186
00:20:24.635 --> 00:20:28.221
Just think of all the
trouble we can get into.

187
00:20:30.975 --> 00:20:33.476
The two of us together.

188
00:20:33.644 --> 00:20:37.647
We can steal a lot
of Golden eggs.

189
00:20:43.821 --> 00:20:46.197
And... you owe me.

190
00:20:46.365 --> 00:20:49.284
- I owe you?
- Mm-hm.

191
00:20:49.452 --> 00:20:51.870
You hit me in the
head with a guitar.

192
00:20:52.038 --> 00:20:54.247
I regret the guitar.

193
00:20:54.415 --> 00:20:56.541
Okay, I forgive you.

194
00:20:56.709 --> 00:20:58.918
So... you're in?

195
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:05.467
There is one teeny, tiny,
itty-bitty problem.

196
00:21:05.635 --> 00:21:07.385
And what is that?

197
00:21:07.553 --> 00:21:10.680
You work for the egg!

198
00:21:10.848 --> 00:21:12.390
Oh, come on, Puss.

199
00:21:12.558 --> 00:21:15.894
What happened between you
and Humpty that was so bad?

200
00:21:18.189 --> 00:21:20.899
I am afraid with
me and Humpty...

201
00:21:21.067 --> 00:21:23.985
the scars are too deep.

202
00:21:28.699 --> 00:21:31.660
It all started a long time ago.

203
00:21:31.827 --> 00:21:33.536
Oh, no. You really
don't have to tell me

204
00:21:33.704 --> 00:21:36.623
- your whole life story, please.
- You may want to sit.

205
00:21:38.042 --> 00:21:41.878
It is at times quite... painful.

206
00:21:42.046 --> 00:21:43.630
Okay, here we go.

207
00:21:45.007 --> 00:21:49.219
It was a year in which
the rain had not fallen.

208
00:21:49.387 --> 00:21:53.014
The wind was big and
the basket was small.

209
00:21:53.724 --> 00:21:55.684
For days, I bounced along...

210
00:21:55.851 --> 00:22:01.231
a hungry little kitten with no
milk, no mama, and no litter box.

211
00:22:01.399 --> 00:22:05.902
Until I came to rest at a
home for lost children.

212
00:22:13.828 --> 00:22:17.747
Her name was lmelda.
And, like a Mother,

213
00:22:17.915 --> 00:22:21.418
she took me into her heart
and raised me as her own.

214
00:22:23.879 --> 00:22:25.171
Silencio.

215
00:22:26.173 --> 00:22:27.465
Silencio.

216
00:22:27.633 --> 00:22:29.843
She was an Angel of kindness.

217
00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:31.886
ISilencio!

218
00:22:32.054 --> 00:22:34.180
Most of the time.

219
00:22:34.348 --> 00:22:37.934
I'd like to introduce
a new boyjoining us.

220
00:22:38.102 --> 00:22:41.771
It's Okay, pequeﾃｱo. You
show with the face.

221
00:22:45.693 --> 00:22:47.026
Go on.

222
00:22:52.658 --> 00:22:56.035
And that was the moment I met...

223
00:22:56.203 --> 00:22:58.037
Humpty Alexander Dumpty.

224
00:22:58.873 --> 00:23:00.206
Hey, whiskers!

225
00:23:00.374 --> 00:23:02.459
You're sitting in Little
Boy Blue's chair.

226
00:23:02.626 --> 00:23:05.128
Oh, come on. Is this necessary?

227
00:23:05.296 --> 00:23:07.380
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size?

228
00:23:07.548 --> 00:23:09.340
Who asked you, Breakfast?

229
00:23:09.508 --> 00:23:10.967
Remember what lmelda
says, Boy Blue.

230
00:23:11.135 --> 00:23:14.262
If you're going to blow your top,
you blow your horn instead, right?

231
00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:16.222
Let's spin him.

232
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:18.057
Please don't spin me.
Do not spin me!

233
00:23:18.225 --> 00:23:20.685
Not again! No! I'm gonna yolk!

234
00:23:20.853 --> 00:23:24.397
Even though he took
my beans, the egg stood up for me,

235
00:23:24.565 --> 00:23:26.691
and I decided then...

236
00:23:26.859 --> 00:23:29.068
that I would
always have his back.

237
00:23:36.327 --> 00:23:37.577
Wow!

238
00:23:37.745 --> 00:23:39.913
That was very impressive.
Thanks!

239
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.207
Hey, egg boy!

240
00:23:44.627 --> 00:23:47.462
There was something
about this strange little egg

241
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:49.589
that intrigued me.

242
00:24:05.272 --> 00:24:08.650
Oh... it's you.

243
00:24:08.818 --> 00:24:10.253
I've been collecting
for months now.

244
00:24:10.277 --> 00:24:12.837
You never know when you're gonna
get lucky. You know what I mean?

245
00:24:14.281 --> 00:24:17.033
Magic beans... is what they are.

246
00:24:18.619 --> 00:24:21.120
Hello? You gonna tell
all the other kids

247
00:24:21.288 --> 00:24:23.873
that I believe in magic now?
Is that what you're gonna do?

248
00:24:26.168 --> 00:24:28.086
No? What's your name?

249
00:24:28.587 --> 00:24:31.548
You don't say much, do you?

250
00:24:31.715 --> 00:24:34.092
I think I'll call you Sparky.

251
00:24:35.052 --> 00:24:36.386
Whiskers?

252
00:24:36.554 --> 00:24:37.762
Zoltar!

253
00:24:39.723 --> 00:24:42.475
How about Puss?

254
00:24:42.643 --> 00:24:46.354
Humpty's mind was full
of imagination and invention.

255
00:24:46.522 --> 00:24:48.162
What is that,
50 feet down there?

256
00:24:48.315 --> 00:24:52.777
Here we go. Give me a... Puss!

257
00:24:52.945 --> 00:24:57.073
Look at me, Puss! I'm flying!

258
00:24:59.952 --> 00:25:04.080
He spoke of legends
and adventures beyond my wildest dreams.

259
00:25:04.248 --> 00:25:07.333
Oh, when I find those magic
beans, they'll grow a Vine

260
00:25:07.501 --> 00:25:09.669
straight up into the clouds,

261
00:25:09.837 --> 00:25:14.132
where a terrible and a fearsome giant
hoards his greatest treasure...

262
00:25:14.925 --> 00:25:16.926
the Golden Goose.

263
00:25:17.094 --> 00:25:19.304
Oh, the Golden Goose. Just one.

264
00:25:19.471 --> 00:25:24.434
Just one of her Golden eggs...
could set me for life.

265
00:25:25.227 --> 00:25:27.020
It's my destiny, Puss.

266
00:25:27.187 --> 00:25:32.650
I can't really explain it, but I
just feel like I belong up there.

267
00:25:36.989 --> 00:25:39.324
Oh, boy. This is awkward.

268
00:25:39.491 --> 00:25:43.161
This is kind of a
solo dream here.

269
00:25:43.329 --> 00:25:46.414
I don't need any dead weight,
you know, holding me down.

270
00:25:48.375 --> 00:25:51.502
What are you doing?
Oh, man, that's good.

271
00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:55.298
The eye thing that you're
doing, that is really splendid.

272
00:25:55.466 --> 00:25:58.468
Okay, let me just think for a
second. All right... Okay.

273
00:25:58.636 --> 00:26:01.930
Uh... This is crazy, but...

274
00:26:02.097 --> 00:26:05.266
I am considering
a partnership.

275
00:26:06.894 --> 00:26:08.770
I just need to know one thing.

276
00:26:09.688 --> 00:26:11.105
Can you commit?

277
00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:13.524
Sﾃｭ... I can commit.

278
00:26:13.692 --> 00:26:16.986
Oh, you can talk!
Could you help me up?

279
00:26:19.531 --> 00:26:20.698
Okay...

280
00:26:22.576 --> 00:26:23.993
First rule of Bean Club...

281
00:26:25.371 --> 00:26:28.456
you do not talk
about Bean Club.

282
00:26:28.624 --> 00:26:30.458
Second rule of Bean Club...

283
00:26:30.626 --> 00:26:34.671
is you don't talk about
Bean Club. You ready?

284
00:26:34.838 --> 00:26:35.964
Ready.

285
00:26:36.757 --> 00:26:39.133
From this day forth,
it shall be known...

286
00:26:39.802 --> 00:26:42.679
Never alone, always together...

287
00:26:42.846 --> 00:26:44.305
Humpty and Puss...

288
00:26:44.473 --> 00:26:45.974
Brothers forever.

289
00:26:46.892 --> 00:26:50.478
And from that moment on,
we were united on a great adventure

290
00:26:50.646 --> 00:26:52.730
to find the magic beans.

291
00:26:52.898 --> 00:26:53.940
Help me up.

292
00:26:54.692 --> 00:26:55.733
Egg me.

293
00:26:55.901 --> 00:26:57.527
Humpty was the brains...

294
00:26:57.695 --> 00:27:00.571
- Good gracious!
- I never saw him!

295
00:27:00.739 --> 00:27:03.449
- That really hurt!
- ...and I was the skill.

296
00:27:04.493 --> 00:27:05.785
I'm cracked!

297
00:27:07.621 --> 00:27:09.455
We got red beans, green beans,

298
00:27:09.623 --> 00:27:12.792
coffee beans, lima beans...
but no magic beans.

299
00:27:14.211 --> 00:27:17.630
- Would you care for a jelly bean?
- Oh, thank you.

300
00:27:17.798 --> 00:27:20.258
Finding them
meant everything to us.

301
00:27:20.884 --> 00:27:23.803
Oh, I almost forgot
the most important thing.

302
00:27:23.971 --> 00:27:25.638
That's me and you, Puss.

303
00:27:27.141 --> 00:27:28.641
Me and you.

304
00:27:28.809 --> 00:27:31.310
But we never did find them.

305
00:27:31.478 --> 00:27:34.731
And, as years passed, the
quest for magic beans

306
00:27:34.898 --> 00:27:39.193
seemed more and more like
the dreams of a child.

307
00:27:40.571 --> 00:27:44.574
As teenagers,
Humpty and I looked for trouble...

308
00:27:44.742 --> 00:27:46.576
and often found it.

309
00:27:46.744 --> 00:27:50.913
Third time this month, lmelda.
Next time is jail time.

310
00:27:51.081 --> 00:27:53.291
They're just kids.

311
00:27:53.459 --> 00:27:55.960
They are thieves.

312
00:28:00.007 --> 00:28:02.925
You are better than this.

313
00:28:03.093 --> 00:28:06.262
I believe in you
with all my heart.

314
00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:10.058
Please do not let me down.

315
00:28:10.225 --> 00:28:11.809
I hate this place.

316
00:28:11.977 --> 00:28:14.520
I cannot wait for us
to get out of here.

317
00:28:16.106 --> 00:28:18.316
Throw a rock. It'll
make you feel better.

318
00:28:21.195 --> 00:28:22.361
Oh, boy. We should go.

319
00:28:24.865 --> 00:28:26.908
On instinct, I reacted.

320
00:28:40.756 --> 00:28:44.926
He saved the
Comandante's Mother!

321
00:28:50.641 --> 00:28:53.392
You saved my Mother.

322
00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:56.395
Seﾃｱor Puss... he is a hero!

323
00:28:58.565 --> 00:29:02.902
Today we see that
courage and bravery

324
00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:04.946
come in all sizes!

325
00:29:05.114 --> 00:29:09.534
Little did I know that one moment
would change my whole life.

326
00:29:09.701 --> 00:29:12.328
These are for you, my boy.

327
00:29:12.496 --> 00:29:17.333
Wear them as a symbol of
honor... and justice.

328
00:29:17.501 --> 00:29:21.254
I will make you proud, Mama.

329
00:29:21.421 --> 00:29:26.425
You already have,
my Puss In Boots.

330
00:29:28.762 --> 00:29:32.014
How strange it was
to give a cat boots...

331
00:29:32.182 --> 00:29:35.351
but, whoa... I looked good!

332
00:29:35.519 --> 00:29:39.021
And as the light of my
path grew brighter...

333
00:29:39.189 --> 00:29:42.859
Humpty's road
grew ever darker.

334
00:29:49.283 --> 00:29:51.033
Gracias, Comandante.

335
00:29:51.201 --> 00:29:53.578
Be careful of the
company you keep.

336
00:29:55.664 --> 00:29:58.791
I know! I know, I never should've
tried something without you.

337
00:29:58.959 --> 00:30:01.085
You're not stealing
lollipops anymore, Humpty.

338
00:30:01.253 --> 00:30:02.461
This is getting serious.

339
00:30:02.629 --> 00:30:05.006
You're right! We have to
be smarter about this.

340
00:30:05.174 --> 00:30:07.383
Here, look. We need
to think bigger.

341
00:30:07.551 --> 00:30:10.303
I've been casing the
silversmith and it's perfect.

342
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:12.930
You and me, in and
out, 50 seconds tops.

343
00:30:13.098 --> 00:30:15.725
Will you put that away!
This is our home.

344
00:30:15.893 --> 00:30:18.519
These people have
done nothing to us.

345
00:30:18.687 --> 00:30:22.148
Our home? Okay,
yeah, I get it now.

346
00:30:22.316 --> 00:30:25.735
You get some fancy boots and
now you're too good for me?

347
00:30:25.903 --> 00:30:27.278
That is not true.

348
00:30:27.446 --> 00:30:29.530
We weren't born here.
We're orphans!

349
00:30:29.698 --> 00:30:31.490
All we got is each
other, you understand?

350
00:30:31.658 --> 00:30:33.284
We are better than this.

351
00:30:34.703 --> 00:30:36.204
But we're partners.

352
00:30:36.371 --> 00:30:38.414
We are brothers.

353
00:30:39.416 --> 00:30:41.876
But I am not stealing anymore.

354
00:30:44.421 --> 00:30:46.881
But Humpty
would not give up so easily.

355
00:30:47.049 --> 00:30:49.008
I'm in trouble, Puss!

356
00:30:49.176 --> 00:30:51.385
It's Boy Blue and his gang.
I owe them some money.

357
00:30:51.553 --> 00:30:53.679
They're coming for me. Just
get me over this wall.

358
00:30:53.847 --> 00:30:57.642
I gotta go. Help me up the wall.
Get me up the wall. Hurry! Hurry!

359
00:31:09.404 --> 00:31:11.697
Okay, I've got everything. We
did it. Come on, let's go!

360
00:31:11.865 --> 00:31:13.366
How could you do this to me?!

361
00:31:13.533 --> 00:31:15.993
I did you a favor! We can
finally get out of here!

362
00:31:16.161 --> 00:31:18.788
This is the money of the people!
This is all they have!

363
00:31:22.709 --> 00:31:25.378
You disgrace those boots!

364
00:31:25.545 --> 00:31:27.421
Comandante, please,
I can explain!

365
00:31:27.589 --> 00:31:28.673
Arrest them!

366
00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.342
Hiyah!

367
00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:35.096
Hurry up! Get to the bridge!

368
00:31:35.264 --> 00:31:38.140
- You tricked me!
- I had to! You left me no choice!

369
00:31:46.316 --> 00:31:48.484
Mama...

370
00:31:48.652 --> 00:31:50.486
Pequeﾃｱo.

371
00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.321
Oh! Watch out!

372
00:32:08.755 --> 00:32:12.425
- Oh, no.
- Puss. I can't get up.

373
00:32:12.592 --> 00:32:14.719
Puss! Help me. I can't get up!

374
00:32:14.886 --> 00:32:16.304
Freeze!

375
00:32:17.055 --> 00:32:18.806
Puss, save me!

376
00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:20.933
Save yourself.

377
00:32:22.144 --> 00:32:23.311
We got you.

378
00:32:38.243 --> 00:32:41.912
I lost everything
I cared about that day.

379
00:32:42.914 --> 00:32:44.749
My brother.

380
00:32:44.916 --> 00:32:46.417
My honor.

381
00:32:46.585 --> 00:32:48.085
My home.

382
00:32:49.588 --> 00:32:54.175
All I thought about was the
disappointment in my mama's eyes.

383
00:32:55.594 --> 00:32:58.095
And I have been
running ever since.

384
00:33:02.267 --> 00:33:05.102
The egg betrayed me.

385
00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:10.149
His lies cost me everything.

386
00:33:11.151 --> 00:33:13.444
- Hey!
- I'm awake!

387
00:33:13.612 --> 00:33:15.738
You think
I don't want to fix the past?

388
00:33:19.242 --> 00:33:20.743
I can't get down.

389
00:33:29.836 --> 00:33:33.756
Listen. A day... A
day doesn't go by

390
00:33:33.924 --> 00:33:36.050
when I don't think
about what I lost.

391
00:33:38.261 --> 00:33:40.763
I lost my best friend.

392
00:33:40.931 --> 00:33:43.933
My only friend.
And I get it now.

393
00:33:44.101 --> 00:33:46.310
I got greedy and desperate
and I let you down.

394
00:33:46.478 --> 00:33:48.521
I let myself down.

395
00:33:48.688 --> 00:33:51.190
All I'm asking for, Puss,
is a second chance.

396
00:33:51.358 --> 00:33:55.319
Give me that second chance and I'll
help you pay back San Ricardo.

397
00:33:55.487 --> 00:33:58.406
Please, Puss.

398
00:33:58.573 --> 00:34:01.450
Let me show you what our
friendship meant to me.

399
00:34:06.206 --> 00:34:08.999
- I will do it.
- Oh, that's great.

400
00:34:09.167 --> 00:34:14.171
I will do this for my Mother and
for San Ricardo... not for you.

401
00:34:14.339 --> 00:34:17.716
We are not partners and
we are not friends.

402
00:34:19.136 --> 00:34:24.348
Okay. I promise this time,
I will not let you down.

403
00:34:25.142 --> 00:34:27.393
Yes!

404
00:34:27.561 --> 00:34:30.020
I think we got our
Bean Club back.

405
00:34:49.875 --> 00:34:51.375
Humpty's plan better work.

406
00:34:51.543 --> 00:34:54.378
Listen, you just need to
worry about your part.

407
00:34:54.546 --> 00:34:56.547
Don't screw it up.

408
00:34:56.715 --> 00:34:59.049
- What?
- Again with the mask?

409
00:34:59.217 --> 00:35:02.011
I don't need style advice
from Mr. Dusty Boots.

410
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:12.062
Come on, Puss. Now!

411
00:35:16.401 --> 00:35:18.944
Our biological clocks
are ticking, darling.

412
00:35:19.112 --> 00:35:20.473
You gotta look at
the big picture.

413
00:35:20.614 --> 00:35:22.698
- What's your problem?
- Huh?

414
00:35:22.866 --> 00:35:26.744
Listen. I put a lot of work into
my body. I look good, and I am not

415
00:35:26.912 --> 00:35:28.432
just gonna throw that away.

416
00:35:31.249 --> 00:35:33.375
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What?

417
00:35:33.543 --> 00:35:34.877
- We're gonna start small.
- Look.

418
00:35:35.045 --> 00:35:37.129
Let's just pretend
you have a baby.

419
00:35:38.632 --> 00:35:41.425
Excellent.

420
00:35:44.187 --> 00:35:46.948
I don't have time to be at home
with no diapers and baby socks.

421
00:35:46.973 --> 00:35:49.642
You don't have to, Jill. I'll
be the stay-at-home dad.

422
00:35:49.809 --> 00:35:52.269
We got ten hungry piggies,
there in the back.

423
00:35:52.437 --> 00:35:55.231
You can practice on them.
Just pull over, feed them.

424
00:35:55.398 --> 00:35:57.460
- Little Hamhock's my favorite.
- You've got to hurry up.

425
00:35:57.484 --> 00:35:59.124
He's a cute little bugger.

426
00:35:59.236 --> 00:36:01.278
Why are you not
using your claws?

427
00:36:01.446 --> 00:36:03.405
Would you please just shut up!
I'm on it!

428
00:36:03.573 --> 00:36:06.033
- Just use your claws!
- Be quiet.

429
00:36:06.201 --> 00:36:08.702
- Your claws!
- I don't have any claws, all right?!

430
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:10.871
Was that Hamhock?

431
00:36:17.045 --> 00:36:20.089
There, there. Sleepy,
sleepy, big, fat piggy.

432
00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:24.941
Remember when we had to pretend
we had that monkey one time?

433
00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:26.762
You babysit.

434
00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:29.515
- Soft paws.
- When did we have a monkey?

435
00:36:32.602 --> 00:36:34.478
- Well?
- ...what happened last time...

436
00:36:34.646 --> 00:36:37.648
- You sat on it, Jack.
- Hello, beans of legend.

437
00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:40.609
Let's go.

438
00:36:48.702 --> 00:36:52.246
Well, well, well. Look
what we have here, Jill.

439
00:36:52.414 --> 00:36:54.957
You messed with our baby.

440
00:36:56.668 --> 00:36:59.920
And you took my beans.

441
00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.089
Sausage bomb!

442
00:37:08.305 --> 00:37:10.764
You're gonna pay for this!
Soul-sucking cats!

443
00:37:13.101 --> 00:37:14.184
Signal the egg!

444
00:37:15.562 --> 00:37:17.730
Yes!

445
00:37:21.693 --> 00:37:23.319
- Okay.
- Ready.

446
00:37:23.486 --> 00:37:25.029
- Set.
- Go!

447
00:37:40.837 --> 00:37:43.088
Oh, my God!

448
00:38:00.899 --> 00:38:03.734
All right, cat.
Give me them beans.

449
00:38:05.403 --> 00:38:08.155
Is it true a cat always
lands on it's feet?

450
00:38:08.323 --> 00:38:11.075
No! That is just a
rumor spread by dogs!

451
00:38:11.785 --> 00:38:13.369
Well, let's find out.

452
00:38:13.536 --> 00:38:14.745
Hiyah!

453
00:38:14.913 --> 00:38:16.705
Hiyah!

454
00:38:21.044 --> 00:38:22.711
See? I told you I
wouldn't let you down!

455
00:38:22.879 --> 00:38:25.923
You think this is over? Ha!

456
00:38:30.303 --> 00:38:33.097
Hey, that was close!

457
00:38:39.229 --> 00:38:40.270
Hiyah!

458
00:38:43.525 --> 00:38:44.608
Now!

459
00:38:47.612 --> 00:38:51.073
We just got to make it
to that bridge! Hang on!

460
00:38:52.492 --> 00:38:54.993
- Humpty! There is no bridge!
- Trust me.

461
00:39:01.543 --> 00:39:03.293
Humpty!

462
00:39:07.424 --> 00:39:11.385
We're going to die!

463
00:39:22.564 --> 00:39:25.983
- I hate cats.
- This is war!

464
00:39:34.701 --> 00:39:36.368
Giant's castle...

465
00:39:37.036 --> 00:39:38.537
here we come.

466
00:39:41.332 --> 00:39:43.542
I must hand it to the egg.

467
00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:46.503
This was a team effort.
Humpty still has his claws...

468
00:39:46.671 --> 00:39:49.840
I mean, flaws. That was
what I meant, not claws.

469
00:39:50.008 --> 00:39:52.009
He's not a cat.

470
00:39:52.177 --> 00:39:55.053
- Not to say there's anything wrong...
- I don't want to talk about it.

471
00:39:55.221 --> 00:39:56.597
Got it.

472
00:39:56.765 --> 00:39:59.641
Okay, we should be close!

473
00:40:00.852 --> 00:40:02.936
Keep your eyes out for any
strange cloud activity!

474
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:06.815
I am called Kitty Softpaws
because I'll steal you blind

475
00:40:06.983 --> 00:40:09.276
and you'll never even
know I was there.

476
00:40:15.533 --> 00:40:16.617
Kitty?

477
00:40:18.036 --> 00:40:19.912
You are not as good as they say.

478
00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:23.916
You're better.

479
00:40:27.045 --> 00:40:29.546
I will respect your privacy.

480
00:40:33.176 --> 00:40:36.678
Okay. I'll tell you.

481
00:40:36.846 --> 00:40:39.473
I was just a stray...

482
00:40:39.641 --> 00:40:42.309
but I had beautiful claws.

483
00:40:43.686 --> 00:40:47.356
One day, a really nice
couple took me in.

484
00:40:47.524 --> 00:40:49.858
Gave me milk every morning.

485
00:40:50.026 --> 00:40:51.360
Loved me.

486
00:40:53.196 --> 00:40:58.200
Maybe I scratched their curtains or
played too rough with the hamster.

487
00:40:58.368 --> 00:41:00.702
I don't know why they did it.

488
00:41:01.412 --> 00:41:03.413
But they took my claws.

489
00:41:05.083 --> 00:41:09.127
Cat people are crazy.

490
00:41:09.295 --> 00:41:11.046
Stop the coach! I
think this is it!

491
00:41:31.818 --> 00:41:33.360
Can you believe this, Puss?

492
00:41:33.528 --> 00:41:36.280
After all these years!

493
00:41:37.782 --> 00:41:40.951
Here. I want you to plant them.

494
00:41:46.833 --> 00:41:49.042
That... is a strange cloud.

495
00:41:52.088 --> 00:41:55.549
Whoa! Okay! This is it!
It's happening, hurry!

496
00:41:58.303 --> 00:41:59.761
This way!

497
00:41:59.929 --> 00:42:02.014
Good, good. Come on,
come on, come on.

498
00:42:02.181 --> 00:42:04.433
Twenty-three divided
by cloud depth.

499
00:42:04.601 --> 00:42:06.268
Hole! Right here.

500
00:42:09.272 --> 00:42:10.814
Now place the beans.

501
00:42:12.066 --> 00:42:14.818
Place the beans carefully, please.

502
00:42:14.986 --> 00:42:18.155
Not on top of each other.
The magic is very delicate.

503
00:42:18.323 --> 00:42:22.284
Okay, good. Very good.
Now just stand back.

504
00:43:05.703 --> 00:43:06.954
What's happening here?

505
00:43:07.121 --> 00:43:08.914
Maybe the magic rubbed
off in your pocket?

506
00:43:09.082 --> 00:43:12.292
- That's impossible.
- Okay, Okay. Let's not panic.

507
00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:14.540
You know, I read somewhere
that plants have feelings.

508
00:43:14.671 --> 00:43:18.382
So, come on... say
something nice to it.

509
00:43:18.549 --> 00:43:19.633
Okay.

510
00:43:20.677 --> 00:43:22.302
Let me just think for a second.

511
00:43:23.137 --> 00:43:24.137
Hi, little plant.

512
00:43:51.165 --> 00:43:52.165
Yow!

513
00:44:45.261 --> 00:44:47.429
Uh, guys? Whoa!

514
00:44:47.597 --> 00:44:49.431
Humpty!

515
00:44:49.599 --> 00:44:52.601
- I do not see him. Do you see him?
- I don't see him anywhere.

516
00:44:52.769 --> 00:44:54.978
You sound weird.

517
00:44:55.146 --> 00:44:58.106
Ah! It's the thin air!

518
00:44:59.067 --> 00:45:02.903
Come on in! It feels great!

519
00:45:09.368 --> 00:45:12.245
- The cloud, it tickles my nose.
- Hoo-hoo!

520
00:45:12.413 --> 00:45:15.916
That's because they effervesce!
Who knew? Ho-ho!

521
00:45:21.964 --> 00:45:22.964
Come on.

522
00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:42.067
Gotcha!

523
00:45:46.197 --> 00:45:48.198
Meow.

524
00:45:48.366 --> 00:45:51.368
Hey, Puss. What do you think?
Do I shave?

525
00:45:52.703 --> 00:45:54.329
Let me show you something.

526
00:46:01.295 --> 00:46:03.755
Somewhere down there, there
are two little kids,

527
00:46:03.923 --> 00:46:06.049
I don't know, maybe orphans,

528
00:46:06.217 --> 00:46:09.136
and they're laying on a hill,
staring at the clouds,

529
00:46:09.303 --> 00:46:11.054
dreaming about the future.

530
00:46:12.056 --> 00:46:13.890
That was me and you, Puss.

531
00:46:14.559 --> 00:46:16.560
Me and you.

532
00:46:18.396 --> 00:46:19.688
Boys!

533
00:46:19.856 --> 00:46:22.816
You might want to
take a look at this.

534
00:46:26.445 --> 00:46:29.030
The giant's castle.

535
00:46:31.951 --> 00:46:34.286
Okay, time to suit up.

536
00:46:34.453 --> 00:46:35.495
Humpty!

537
00:46:35.663 --> 00:46:37.831
I'll fit right in
with the Golden eggs.

538
00:46:41.836 --> 00:46:43.545
Brilliant or what, huh?

539
00:46:43.713 --> 00:46:47.257
Humpty, you're not
wearing underwear!

540
00:46:47.425 --> 00:46:49.926
What? Are you embarrassed?

541
00:46:50.094 --> 00:46:51.344
I'm not.

542
00:46:51.846 --> 00:46:56.099
Puss, remember when
everyone was laughing at Bean Club?

543
00:46:56.267 --> 00:46:59.269
And who is laughing now?
Ha-ha! We are!

544
00:47:10.114 --> 00:47:11.948
Wow!

545
00:47:24.295 --> 00:47:27.297
That is our target.

546
00:47:27.465 --> 00:47:29.776
Hey, you don't
sound like an elf anymore.

547
00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.653
It's because the air
pressure in here is normal.

548
00:47:31.677 --> 00:47:32.677
Let's go.

549
00:47:36.724 --> 00:47:40.352
You two get the
Golden eggs, I will fight the giant.

550
00:47:40.519 --> 00:47:43.271
There's no giant to fight. The
giant's been dead for years.

551
00:47:43.439 --> 00:47:45.690
- What?!
- You didn't do the reading, did you?

552
00:47:45.858 --> 00:47:49.319
Jack and the Beanstalk, chapter
14, "Giant Takes a Big Dirt Nap."

553
00:47:49.487 --> 00:47:52.239
Ahh! Ankle burn.

554
00:47:54.242 --> 00:47:57.077
- Wha... what was that?
- They call it the Great Terror.

555
00:47:57.245 --> 00:47:59.663
It's the monster that
guards the Golden Goose.

556
00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:02.332
Legend has it that if you look
at it, you'll turn to Stone.

557
00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:06.044
But nobody really knows because
nobody's walked away from it alive.

558
00:48:06.212 --> 00:48:08.129
Follow me and keep quiet.

559
00:48:18.224 --> 00:48:19.474
Shh! Humpty!

560
00:48:19.642 --> 00:48:22.560
I can't help it. Everything's
rubbing and pinching!

561
00:48:22.728 --> 00:48:24.271
I need powder!

562
00:48:40.663 --> 00:48:42.038
How are we gonna get across?

563
00:48:42.206 --> 00:48:44.207
Champagne.

564
00:48:47.753 --> 00:48:49.045
Cheers!

565
00:49:00.891 --> 00:49:02.642
Do not worry. I
will protect you.

566
00:49:05.646 --> 00:49:06.813
What are you gonna do?

567
00:49:06.981 --> 00:49:08.815
Hit it in the head
with a guitar?

568
00:49:08.983 --> 00:49:12.027
Please. Stop bringing
up the guitar.

569
00:49:30.546 --> 00:49:32.922
Catch me!

570
00:49:34.091 --> 00:49:35.342
Hurry!

571
00:49:36.719 --> 00:49:38.094
Hide!

572
00:49:39.347 --> 00:49:40.597
Don't look at it!

573
00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:48.855
- Shh! Humpty! Be quiet!
- I'm hyperventilating!

574
00:49:49.023 --> 00:49:52.609
I said I couldn't breathe and
then you zipped the thing over my mouth!

575
00:49:52.777 --> 00:49:56.196
Shh! Hey. You gotta get
it together. Come on!

576
00:49:56.364 --> 00:49:57.614
Okay.

577
00:50:12.671 --> 00:50:16.257
Look at this.
It's egg paradise.

578
00:50:17.843 --> 00:50:20.512
It's so beautiful, I
feel like I belong here.

579
00:50:26.852 --> 00:50:29.229
Golden eggs. Oh!

580
00:50:30.481 --> 00:50:31.815
Grab as many as you can.

581
00:50:31.982 --> 00:50:36.778
I thought they were
going to be like chicken size.

582
00:50:36.946 --> 00:50:41.157
Can you imagine laying
one of these? Ouch!

583
00:50:41.325 --> 00:50:44.828
Puss! Ow!

584
00:50:45.588 --> 00:50:47.348
How are we supposed to
get these out of here?

585
00:50:47.373 --> 00:50:48.748
- I don't know.
- Shh!

586
00:50:51.168 --> 00:50:53.211
Oh, my!

587
00:50:56.006 --> 00:50:58.842
The Golden Goose.

588
00:51:00.511 --> 00:51:03.179
Just look at her.
Isn't she beautiful?

589
00:51:13.899 --> 00:51:16.276
Oh... My sweet darling.

590
00:51:16.444 --> 00:51:19.821
I think she likes you.

591
00:51:23.075 --> 00:51:24.396
Let's just take her.

592
00:51:24.535 --> 00:51:26.327
Wait a minute. This is
the goose of legend.

593
00:51:26.495 --> 00:51:28.135
We don't know what
happens if we take her.

594
00:51:29.457 --> 00:51:32.709
I know what happens if we don't
take her, we got nothing.

595
00:51:32.877 --> 00:51:37.005
Guys, guys. It's a gold pooper.
We're taking it!

596
00:51:46.724 --> 00:51:47.849
Almost there!

597
00:51:50.769 --> 00:51:51.769
Hang on!

598
00:51:57.818 --> 00:51:58.943
Hang on!

599
00:52:19.965 --> 00:52:21.341
It's coming!

600
00:52:21.509 --> 00:52:23.051
Run!

601
00:52:38.859 --> 00:52:40.068
Kitty!

602
00:52:42.321 --> 00:52:43.947
What are you doing?

603
00:53:06.637 --> 00:53:09.430
- Hang on!
- Whoa!

604
00:53:12.434 --> 00:53:13.810
Come here, you.

605
00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:18.690
Got you!

606
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:21.609
She's mine now!

607
00:53:31.662 --> 00:53:33.288
Hello!

608
00:53:38.669 --> 00:53:41.838
Oh, no! Fly, little
gosling, fly!

609
00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:48.886
No! It's not supposed
to be this way!

610
00:53:50.889 --> 00:53:52.557
- Puss?
- No.

611
00:54:00.774 --> 00:54:02.734
Uh... I'm sorry.

612
00:54:18.375 --> 00:54:20.209
Thanks, Ginger.

613
00:54:25.799 --> 00:54:28.843
Um, we should maybe
cut that down.

614
00:54:32.848 --> 00:54:34.098
Look at that.

615
00:54:34.266 --> 00:54:36.184
You finally got that
family you wanted, Jack.

616
00:54:36.352 --> 00:54:38.603
Did you hear that?

617
00:54:38.771 --> 00:54:40.104
I think he just called me Daddy.

618
00:54:40.272 --> 00:54:44.609
- Oh! He looks just like you, Jack.
- Thank you.

619
00:54:55.162 --> 00:54:57.914
Well, what is it?

620
00:55:07.758 --> 00:55:11.052
I do believe that's our cue.

621
00:55:15.432 --> 00:55:17.192
To paying back San Ricardo!

622
00:55:17.643 --> 00:55:19.185
To being rich!

623
00:55:19.353 --> 00:55:20.478
IOIﾃｩ!

624
00:55:33.575 --> 00:55:36.119
You.

625
00:55:36.286 --> 00:55:37.704
Me?

626
00:55:37.871 --> 00:55:40.039
Yeah, yeah, baby!

627
00:55:42.042 --> 00:55:43.876
One, two, cha-cha-cha!

628
00:55:44.044 --> 00:55:46.504
Three, four, cha-cha-cha!
One, two...

629
00:55:46.672 --> 00:55:48.005
What?!

630
00:55:49.758 --> 00:55:53.761
There is one word for you,
Me-wow!

631
00:55:53.929 --> 00:55:56.347
I know you have quite a
reputation with the ladies,

632
00:55:56.515 --> 00:55:58.850
Mr. Friskie Two-Times.

633
00:55:59.059 --> 00:56:01.853
I've also been known as the...
Furry Lover!

634
00:56:04.231 --> 00:56:06.274
But that was before I met you.

635
00:56:06.442 --> 00:56:07.692
You don't know me, Puss.

636
00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:11.487
I'm not who you think I am.
I'm all about the score.

637
00:56:11.655 --> 00:56:13.698
Come on. Look me in the eyes

638
00:56:13.866 --> 00:56:16.576
and tell me all you
care about is the gold.

639
00:56:17.661 --> 00:56:20.663
- Puss...
- Kitty...

640
00:56:20.831 --> 00:56:22.123
Oh, my God!

641
00:56:23.876 --> 00:56:26.335
New partners!

642
00:56:26.503 --> 00:56:29.005
Do not fall
for his animal magnetism.

643
00:56:29.173 --> 00:56:30.256
You stay focused.

644
00:56:31.133 --> 00:56:32.508
What?!

645
00:56:41.059 --> 00:56:44.353
So... I have
been thinking, Miss Softpaws,

646
00:56:44.521 --> 00:56:48.316
that when we go our separate ways,
we can go our separate ways...

647
00:56:48.484 --> 00:56:49.984
together.

648
00:56:52.029 --> 00:56:54.238
Puss, you have to go, now.

649
00:56:54.406 --> 00:56:56.824
You do not have to
push me away anymore.

650
00:56:56.992 --> 00:56:58.951
- You can trust me.
- But...

651
00:56:59.119 --> 00:57:00.870
Give it up for the
legends of San Ricardo,

652
00:57:01.038 --> 00:57:03.331
Humpty and Puss! We did it!

653
00:57:05.626 --> 00:57:09.045
- I'm calling it a night, guys.
- Kitty! Stay up with us.

654
00:57:09.213 --> 00:57:13.007
No, I feel a...
Hairball coming on.

655
00:57:13.926 --> 00:57:16.719
Okay, yeah. Have
fun with that!

656
00:57:16.887 --> 00:57:18.930
We should give her some privacy.

657
00:57:21.433 --> 00:57:23.976
I never thought we
would get to here.

658
00:57:25.229 --> 00:57:27.605
After all we went through...

659
00:57:27.773 --> 00:57:30.107
to pull this off, together.

660
00:57:32.027 --> 00:57:34.320
It is good to have
my brother back.

661
00:57:34.947 --> 00:57:37.990
Yep. Sure is.

662
00:57:38.158 --> 00:57:40.660
Well, we have
a big day tomorrow.

663
00:57:40.828 --> 00:57:43.913
Pretty exciting stuff.

664
00:57:44.081 --> 00:57:45.456
We should get some rest.

665
00:57:46.959 --> 00:57:50.336
Good night, Humpty.

666
00:57:55.884 --> 00:57:57.301
Canasta!

667
00:58:27.875 --> 00:58:30.751
I am still alive!

668
00:58:36.174 --> 00:58:38.175
Jack and Jill.

669
00:58:39.469 --> 00:58:40.469
Kitty?

670
00:58:41.263 --> 00:58:42.305
Humpty?

671
00:58:44.683 --> 00:58:46.517
I will find you.

672
00:58:51.231 --> 00:58:53.065
Get out of here!

673
00:59:46.828 --> 00:59:48.162
Be gone!

674
00:59:49.748 --> 00:59:53.209
What do you want?
Gold? I have gold!

675
00:59:53.377 --> 00:59:56.212
Jack, egg's trying to bribe us.

676
00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:58.005
With our own gold.

677
00:59:58.173 --> 01:00:00.276
Come on now, all we want
is a little breakfast.

678
01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:01.467
No, no, please!

679
01:00:01.635 --> 01:00:03.302
How do you like
your eggs, pumpkin?

680
01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:04.887
Humpty, no!

681
01:00:10.268 --> 01:00:12.812
Hello, Puss.

682
01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:14.605
Surprise!

683
01:00:17.776 --> 01:00:18.859
What is going on?

684
01:00:19.027 --> 01:00:23.030
It's a surprise party, and
the surprise is on you.

685
01:00:23.198 --> 01:00:25.783
Looks like the cat's
out of the bag.

686
01:00:26.410 --> 01:00:27.410
You were in cahoots?!

687
01:00:27.577 --> 01:00:30.037
Oh, yeah! They all work for me.

688
01:00:33.083 --> 01:00:37.253
I spent a lot of time in
prison preparing for this.

689
01:00:37.421 --> 01:00:40.256
- You set me up.
- Oh, yeah, I set you up. Of course.

690
01:00:40.424 --> 01:00:44.760
You think this was all about getting
the gold and clearing your name?

691
01:00:44.928 --> 01:00:49.390
This little adventure
was about one thing.

692
01:00:50.350 --> 01:00:51.684
Revenge.

693
01:00:52.894 --> 01:00:58.858
You never knew it, Puss...
but I was always there.

694
01:01:18.962 --> 01:01:22.757
You wanted to repay an old
debt, Puss? Well, so did I.

695
01:01:22.924 --> 01:01:25.843
- Why would you do this?
- You left me on that bridge!

696
01:01:26.011 --> 01:01:28.095
You abandoned me when I
needed you the most.

697
01:01:28.263 --> 01:01:30.890
- What happened to "brothers forever"?!
- I trusted you!

698
01:01:31.058 --> 01:01:33.219
Well, now you're finally gonna
know what it feels like,

699
01:01:33.310 --> 01:01:36.062
you know, to trust someone and
have them stab you in the back.

700
01:01:36.229 --> 01:01:38.022
Guards!

701
01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:42.985
Puss In Boots, you're under arrest for
the robbery of the San Ricardo Bank!

702
01:01:43.153 --> 01:01:45.154
Consider this the final
meeting of Bean Club.

703
01:01:45.322 --> 01:01:47.907
I should scramble you with onions!

704
01:01:48.492 --> 01:01:50.493
You should never have come back.

705
01:01:51.995 --> 01:01:55.081
ﾂ｡Pequeﾃｱo! Wait.

706
01:01:55.248 --> 01:01:57.374
Do not fight them, please.

707
01:01:57.542 --> 01:02:00.336
Mama! Listen to me.
I can explain.

708
01:02:00.504 --> 01:02:04.924
No. Puss, no more running.

709
01:02:05.092 --> 01:02:09.220
Please stop breaking my heart
and face what you have done.

710
01:02:12.265 --> 01:02:14.016
I'm sorry, Mama.

711
01:02:15.102 --> 01:02:16.769
I let you down.

712
01:02:19.648 --> 01:02:21.649
Paws where we can see them!

713
01:02:22.818 --> 01:02:24.819
Turn around... slow.

714
01:02:27.030 --> 01:02:28.489
Slower!

715
01:02:35.288 --> 01:02:38.249
Step into the carrier...
quiet-like.

716
01:02:46.424 --> 01:02:47.664
Attention! Attention, everyone!

717
01:02:47.801 --> 01:02:50.010
If you could just come
in a little closer.

718
01:02:50.178 --> 01:02:51.720
Ladies and gentlemen,

719
01:02:51.888 --> 01:02:55.224
I present to you... the
Golden Goose of legend!

720
01:03:00.147 --> 01:03:03.357
Kitty. Not you, too?

721
01:03:07.988 --> 01:03:10.573
Gold for everyone!

722
01:03:13.326 --> 01:03:15.953
We got some fresh, hot
gold here, people!

723
01:03:16.121 --> 01:03:20.416
Step right up! Get it hot!

724
01:03:20.584 --> 01:03:22.918
IHuevos! IHuevos! IHuevos!

725
01:03:30.343 --> 01:03:32.344
One hat.

726
01:03:32.512 --> 01:03:34.638
One belt.

727
01:03:34.806 --> 01:03:37.057
And two boots...

728
01:03:37.225 --> 01:03:40.019
once a symbol of honor.

729
01:03:41.688 --> 01:03:43.981
One bottle of catnip?

730
01:03:44.149 --> 01:03:47.151
Uh... it is for my glaucoma.

731
01:03:51.072 --> 01:03:54.325
This is where you
belong, outlaw.

732
01:03:54.492 --> 01:03:59.205
And this is where you
will stay... forever.

733
01:04:14.012 --> 01:04:16.180
Whoo-hoo!

734
01:04:16.348 --> 01:04:19.266
No, no. Don't stop
on my account.

735
01:04:31.112 --> 01:04:35.491
Well, it looks like the
egg got what he wanted.

736
01:04:35.659 --> 01:04:37.451
You're talking about Humpty?

737
01:04:37.619 --> 01:04:39.203
Don't say his name!

738
01:04:39.371 --> 01:04:42.957
I used to share this cell
with that smelly thing.

739
01:04:43.124 --> 01:04:46.168
Happiest day of my
life was when he left.

740
01:04:46.336 --> 01:04:48.921
Till I realized he
stole my magic beans.

741
01:04:49.089 --> 01:04:52.132
Wait, wait, wait! You had
the beans? Who are you?

742
01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:55.177
Hey! What's your name?

743
01:04:55.345 --> 01:04:57.888
Andy Beanstalk!

744
01:04:58.056 --> 01:04:59.974
My friends call me Jack.

745
01:05:00.141 --> 01:05:03.352
I traded the family
cow for them beans.

746
01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.354
Course'n, it wasn't
my family's cow.

747
01:05:05.522 --> 01:05:08.524
It was some other family's family
cow. That's why I got eight to ten.

748
01:05:08.692 --> 01:05:12.778
Always know which cow is yours.

749
01:05:12.946 --> 01:05:15.239
Crazy man. Wake up!

750
01:05:15.407 --> 01:05:17.992
What else do you know?

751
01:05:18.159 --> 01:05:22.079
We're all goners, thanks
to that little stinky!

752
01:05:22.247 --> 01:05:27.293
I told him not to take the goose,
but all he wanted was his revenge!

753
01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:29.670
Don't take the goose. Why?

754
01:05:31.965 --> 01:05:37.177
The Great Terror!
That's the Golden Goose's mama.

755
01:05:37.345 --> 01:05:38.595
Oh, no.

756
01:05:38.763 --> 01:05:41.432
And she will be out for blood

757
01:05:41.599 --> 01:05:45.102
when she comes
back for her baby.

758
01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:46.687
Guard!

759
01:05:46.855 --> 01:05:49.940
San Ricardo is in terrible
danger! You must listen to me!

760
01:05:50.108 --> 01:05:51.108
Quiet, you!

761
01:06:13.798 --> 01:06:17.051
Shut up.

762
01:06:34.319 --> 01:06:36.820
Open the door.

763
01:06:43.787 --> 01:06:45.788
Drop the weapon.

764
01:06:46.956 --> 01:06:48.916
Very good.

765
01:06:49.084 --> 01:06:51.251
Step aside.

766
01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.587
No.

767
01:06:53.755 --> 01:06:55.381
Diablo Gato!

768
01:06:56.299 --> 01:06:58.384
Nice try.

769
01:07:10.522 --> 01:07:12.272
I hope you can forgive me.

770
01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.900
Apology accepted!

771
01:07:16.319 --> 01:07:18.278
I don't really
have time for you.

772
01:07:18.446 --> 01:07:20.531
I have to save the town
from the Great Terror!

773
01:07:20.698 --> 01:07:22.574
Wait, Puss!

774
01:07:22.742 --> 01:07:24.743
Don't you see? I'm
here because...

775
01:07:26.079 --> 01:07:28.247
I am here because
you made me realize

776
01:07:28.415 --> 01:07:31.959
that there is something I
care about more than gold.

777
01:07:32.877 --> 01:07:34.378
Something?

778
01:07:34.546 --> 01:07:37.714
Okay. Someone.

779
01:07:37.882 --> 01:07:40.426
He's about two feet
tall, wears high heels.

780
01:07:40.593 --> 01:07:42.052
Handsome?

781
01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:44.221
He's very handsome.

782
01:07:44.389 --> 01:07:46.306
- A real beefcake?
- Mm-hm.

783
01:07:46.474 --> 01:07:47.766
- A stallion?
- Yes.

784
01:07:47.934 --> 01:07:49.685
- Tiger?
- Oh, brother.

785
01:07:49.853 --> 01:07:52.938
But this
does not make us even.

786
01:07:53.731 --> 01:07:56.191
- Freeze!
- Yes, it does.

787
01:07:56.359 --> 01:07:58.152
No, no, no, it doesn't.

788
01:08:02.532 --> 01:08:03.574
I saved you!

789
01:08:04.826 --> 01:08:05.909
You owed me one.

790
01:08:07.036 --> 01:08:08.537
You didn't tell me about Humpty.

791
01:08:10.915 --> 01:08:12.249
So now you owe me two.

792
01:08:16.921 --> 01:08:19.548
- You're a lot of work.
- I know. But I am worth it!

793
01:08:24.179 --> 01:08:26.597
You are not getting
away, Puss In Boots!

794
01:08:27.265 --> 01:08:28.765
Wrong boots.

795
01:08:29.809 --> 01:08:30.851
Kitty!

796
01:08:31.019 --> 01:08:33.228
Now we're even!

797
01:08:41.112 --> 01:08:43.697
This is your San Ricardo
weather report.

798
01:08:43.865 --> 01:08:46.575
Chances of a giant goose
destroying the town...

799
01:08:46.743 --> 01:08:48.702
one hundred percent.

800
01:08:53.208 --> 01:08:56.293
Never alone, always together...

801
01:08:56.461 --> 01:08:57.711
Humpty and Puss...

802
01:08:57.879 --> 01:08:59.463
Brothers forever.

803
01:09:02.342 --> 01:09:03.884
Come on, sweetie.

804
01:09:04.052 --> 01:09:06.303
Let's, uh, get out of here
before Mama shows up.

805
01:09:07.889 --> 01:09:10.557
I should make you into
an egg salad sandwich!

806
01:09:10.725 --> 01:09:13.310
That is disgusting!

807
01:09:13.478 --> 01:09:16.980
- Give me the goose, Humpty.
- No can do, I'm afraid.

808
01:09:17.148 --> 01:09:19.148
See, the mama's on her way,
and when she gets here,

809
01:09:19.192 --> 01:09:23.070
it's bye-bye San Ricardo and
everything you ever cared about!

810
01:09:23.238 --> 01:09:27.658
Revenge on me is one thing,
but why lmelda? Why the orphanage?

811
01:09:27.825 --> 01:09:29.451
This is our home.

812
01:09:29.619 --> 01:09:31.453
You mean your home.

813
01:09:31.621 --> 01:09:35.749
I never belonged here.

814
01:09:35.917 --> 01:09:37.292
We had a plan to
get out of here,

815
01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:40.504
but then you became a hero and
you picked this place over me.

816
01:09:42.924 --> 01:09:44.758
You left me with nothing.

817
01:09:49.764 --> 01:09:52.432
Humpty... I'm sorry I hurt you.

818
01:09:54.769 --> 01:09:57.020
But do not take it
out on these people.

819
01:09:57.188 --> 01:09:58.855
You are better than this!

820
01:10:00.275 --> 01:10:02.401
- No, I'm not.
- Oh, come on!

821
01:10:02.569 --> 01:10:04.278
I know the real Humpty.

822
01:10:04.445 --> 01:10:08.574
The way you saw the world!
The inventor! The dreamer!

823
01:10:08.741 --> 01:10:11.243
What happened to that guy?

824
01:10:16.416 --> 01:10:18.875
I... I think it's too late.

825
01:10:19.043 --> 01:10:21.336
It is never too late
to do the right thing.

826
01:10:21.504 --> 01:10:23.880
Together we can
save San Ricardo!

827
01:10:29.596 --> 01:10:33.181
I can forgive you, Humpty...
if you help me now.

828
01:10:33.349 --> 01:10:35.434
Really?

829
01:10:35.602 --> 01:10:38.020
After everything I
put you through?

830
01:10:38.187 --> 01:10:40.981
Prove to me there is
still a good egg in you.

831
01:10:43.526 --> 01:10:44.776
I'll try.

832
01:11:22.357 --> 01:11:25.567
Run!

833
01:11:36.621 --> 01:11:39.206
- Goggles, check.
- Get the baby over the bridge.

834
01:11:39.374 --> 01:11:40.517
I'll get the Mother to follow.

835
01:11:40.541 --> 01:11:43.752
Okay. Give me a... Puss!

836
01:12:07.485 --> 01:12:08.985
Mama Goose!

837
01:12:11.781 --> 01:12:13.532
Wait!

838
01:12:15.410 --> 01:12:17.953
Just follow me and I will
lead you to your baby.

839
01:12:21.457 --> 01:12:25.627
No! Not that way!

840
01:12:27.463 --> 01:12:29.089
Pequeﾃｱo, help!

841
01:12:29.257 --> 01:12:30.716
Hang on!

842
01:12:40.101 --> 01:12:41.685
That's my boy!

843
01:12:46.774 --> 01:12:49.192
Come with me, Mama Goose. I
know where your baby is.

844
01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:51.695
Here. Look!

845
01:13:03.166 --> 01:13:05.000
Humpty, pick up the pace!

846
01:13:05.168 --> 01:13:07.502
I'm trying, Puss! I'm trying!

847
01:13:12.967 --> 01:13:16.219
Sorry, egghead, we want
more than just eggs.

848
01:13:16.387 --> 01:13:18.180
So how about you
give us that goose!

849
01:13:18.347 --> 01:13:20.932
Humpty!

850
01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:22.181
Get her off!

851
01:13:23.853 --> 01:13:27.439
- Nice moves.
- What would you do without me?

852
01:13:31.194 --> 01:13:33.320
Freeze!

853
01:13:36.491 --> 01:13:39.826
Comandante! Uh, I can explain?

854
01:13:39.994 --> 01:13:45.540
Gato, you are going back to jail
if it's the last thing I do!

855
01:13:45.708 --> 01:13:47.000
Humpty, hurry!

856
01:13:47.168 --> 01:13:50.337
We're almost there.
We're almost there!

857
01:14:12.735 --> 01:14:16.404
- Puss, help!
- Humpty, hang on!

858
01:14:16.906 --> 01:14:19.324
Puss!

859
01:14:28.209 --> 01:14:30.877
Here we are again, right, Puss?

860
01:14:33.422 --> 01:14:36.925
I will not leave you
behind this time, Humpty.

861
01:14:45.351 --> 01:14:47.269
I'm sorry, Puss.

862
01:14:47.436 --> 01:14:49.229
I've made a mess
out of everything.

863
01:14:50.314 --> 01:14:52.774
I'm a rotten egg.

864
01:14:52.942 --> 01:14:55.694
I'm not a person.

865
01:14:55.862 --> 01:14:59.573
I'm not a bird. I'm
not even a food.

866
01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:02.409
I don't know what I am.

867
01:15:03.244 --> 01:15:05.954
You are what you
have always been.

868
01:15:06.581 --> 01:15:07.914
My brother.

869
01:15:10.334 --> 01:15:12.252
Brothers forever.

870
01:15:25.349 --> 01:15:29.102
- You can't save us both.
- Yes, I can! Just hang on!

871
01:15:30.771 --> 01:15:35.734
Puss, you have to save the baby, or
the mama will destroy San Ricardo.

872
01:15:37.904 --> 01:15:39.487
It's the right thing to do.

873
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:45.619
I will not let you go, Humpty.

874
01:15:46.704 --> 01:15:47.829
I know you won't.

875
01:15:48.956 --> 01:15:51.124
So I won't make you choose.

876
01:15:52.501 --> 01:15:54.961
Humpty!

877
01:16:15.191 --> 01:16:17.067
I'm very sorry.

878
01:16:17.234 --> 01:16:18.818
She's Okay.

879
01:16:26.661 --> 01:16:28.078
Humpty?

880
01:16:46.639 --> 01:16:50.392
I always knew that you
were good inside.

881
01:17:04.031 --> 01:17:05.907
Goodbye, Humpty.

882
01:17:17.044 --> 01:17:20.296
- Yeah, I think it's wonderful...
- And I got a goose egg.

883
01:17:20.464 --> 01:17:22.048
It's him. Puss In Boots.

884
01:17:22.216 --> 01:17:24.050
He saved us from
the giant goose!

885
01:17:24.218 --> 01:17:26.136
His sword is like lightning!

886
01:17:26.303 --> 01:17:28.096
They say he has ten lives.

887
01:17:28.264 --> 01:17:32.142
His boots are made of the
finest Corinthian leather.

888
01:17:32.309 --> 01:17:34.602
He only drinks whole milk.

889
01:17:38.107 --> 01:17:39.399
Good leche.

890
01:17:39.567 --> 01:17:42.861
He's no outlaw. He saved us!

891
01:17:43.654 --> 01:17:45.572
Uh, meow?

892
01:17:47.241 --> 01:17:49.784
A gift for you, Mama.

893
01:17:52.496 --> 01:17:56.458
I have to go. The soldiers
are coming for me.

894
01:17:58.586 --> 01:18:03.506
I am so proud of you, my son.

895
01:18:03.674 --> 01:18:08.303
Today, you faced the past
with bravery and honor.

896
01:18:08.471 --> 01:18:11.139
You earned those boots.

897
01:18:11.307 --> 01:18:16.311
And the people know that you are
San Ricardo's greatest hero.

898
01:18:17.646 --> 01:18:19.189
I did it for you, Mama.

899
01:18:20.357 --> 01:18:23.109
You will always be in my heart.

900
01:18:23.277 --> 01:18:25.487
And you in mine.

901
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:30.116
ﾂ｡Gato! Hmm?

902
01:18:30.284 --> 01:18:32.786
- There he is!
- I see him!

903
01:18:43.005 --> 01:18:44.839
Toot-toot!

904
01:19:14.662 --> 01:19:17.455
I will see you again,
Kitty Softpaws!

905
01:19:17.623 --> 01:19:20.500
Sooner than you think.

906
01:19:27.216 --> 01:19:30.677
She is a bad Kitty.

907
01:19:36.392 --> 01:19:40.186
This is the story
of a cat who became a hero.

908
01:19:40.354 --> 01:19:44.858
An outlaw dedicated to justice.
And a lover of beautiful women.

909
01:19:45.025 --> 01:19:48.653
A great... great lover.

910
01:19:48.821 --> 01:19:51.447
Really. It is crazy.

911
01:19:51.615 --> 01:19:54.367
I am Puss In Boots!

912
01:19:54.535 --> 01:19:58.872
And my name would become...
legend!

913
01:20:25.608 --> 01:20:28.151
Whoo-hoo!

914
01:20:31.906 --> 01:20:33.364
Meow.

915
01:20:41.457 --> 01:20:43.124
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
