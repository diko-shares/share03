181
00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.664
Not bad, kid. Name's Ray Jackson.

182
00:20:37.698 --> 00:20:38.999
I'm Frank Dux.

183
00:20:47.508 --> 00:20:48.809
Mrs. Tanaka...

184
00:20:48.843 --> 00:20:50.345
Mrs. Tanaka?

185
00:20:50.678 --> 00:20:51.812
Yes?

186
00:20:51.846 --> 00:20:53.314
Mrs. Tanaka, it's very important

187
00:20:53.348 --> 00:20:55.149
to the government of the United States

188
00:20:55.182 --> 00:20:56.684
that we find Frank Dux.

189
00:20:56.718 --> 00:21:00.655
We understand that he might have
visited Mr. Tanaka here recently.

190
00:21:00.688 --> 00:21:03.190
Mr. Tanaka is very ill.

191
00:21:03.223 --> 00:21:05.225
We're sorry to hear that.

192
00:21:05.893 --> 00:21:07.828
Was Frank here recently?

193
00:21:07.862 --> 00:21:10.698
Frank came here to pay his respects.

194
00:21:10.732 --> 00:21:12.833
When was that? Two days ago.

195
00:21:12.867 --> 00:21:16.404
Did he say, or do you know if he
was going to Hong Kong?

196
00:21:17.305 --> 00:21:18.606
I don't know.

197
00:21:18.639 --> 00:21:20.941
Of course you know.
Look, we're not trying to...

198
00:21:20.975 --> 00:21:24.780
Mrs. Tanaka, we're very sorry to
have disturbed you.

199
00:21:24.813 --> 00:21:27.147
Thank you very much for your time.

200
00:21:33.822 --> 00:21:35.456
HOTEL CLERK: May I help you?
JACKSON: Yeah. How you doing?

201
00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:37.625
My name's Jackson.
This is Mr. Frank Dux.

202
00:21:37.658 --> 00:21:38.959
Are our rooms ready?

203
00:21:38.993 --> 00:21:43.130
Mr. Lin in Room 310 wants to see you
after you check in.

204
00:21:43.163 --> 00:21:44.965
Who the hell's Mr. Lin?

205
00:21:44.999 --> 00:21:48.336
I'm Lin. You Jackson?
You look like a Jackson.

206
00:21:51.171 --> 00:21:52.973
That would make you Frank Ducks.

207
00:21:53.007 --> 00:21:55.643
No, no. It's Dux.

208
00:21:55.676 --> 00:21:58.613
Gotcha. Like "Put up
your dukes," right?

209
00:21:58.646 --> 00:22:00.280
Okay, so here's the deal.

210
00:22:00.315 --> 00:22:02.550
This is the biggest kumite ever.

211
00:22:02.583 --> 00:22:04.652
We got fighters from all over.

212
00:22:04.685 --> 00:22:06.621
I've been assigned by the IFAA

213
00:22:06.654 --> 00:22:09.457
to help you and the other
North American fighters

214
00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:11.459
to find your way around.

215
00:22:11.492 --> 00:22:14.128
I'm gonna make sure you
guys give it your best

216
00:22:14.161 --> 00:22:16.832
and don't disqualify by fighting
outside the arena.

217

The Triad, they are like the Mafia,

218
00:22:21.002 --> 00:22:23.504

kumite here this time.

219
00:22:28.009 --> 00:22:30.846
Here it comes, man. The Walled City.

220

221

You are in Hong Kong,

222

but you are about to cross an
invisible border into Mainland China.

223
00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.287
No joke, man.

226

the old lease agreement

Okay, guys.

240
00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:25.821
First, you'll show the Black
Dragon boys your invitation.

241
00:25:25.853 --> 00:25:28.856
Then, you got to qualify
and prove to them

242
00:25:28.889 --> 00:25:32.160
you can step onto the runway
and not get killed.

243
00:25:32.193 --> 00:25:33.394

Mmm-hmm.

244

Mmm-hmm.

246
00:25:54.883 --> 00:25:57.753
It says he represents the Tanaka clan.

247
00:25:59.688 --> 00:26:01.657
You don't look like Tanaka.

248
00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:03.992
Shidoshi Tanaka trained me.

What's the hold-up?

250
00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:08.630
He says Senzo Tanaka is his shidoshi.

251
00:26:08.664 --> 00:26:12.300
What's the difference if
Bruce Springsteen is his shidoshi?

252

If Senzo Tanaka is his shidoshi,

253
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:17.472
then show us the dim-mak.

254
00:26:17.505 --> 00:26:19.540

man that we're looking for.

His name is Frank Dux.

274

We have reason to believe Frank is
here in Hong Kong.

two days ago.

went somewhere else.

We were hoping you'd hold on to
this for reference.

281
00:28:40.416 --> 00:28:43.219
We're here because Frank is going
to fight in the kumite,

282
00:28:43.252 --> 00:28:45.521
and we're here to stop him.

Yes.

00:29:08.544 --> 00:29:12.147
we all know that the kumite is
happening here in Hong Kong.

287
00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.417
And we all know it's going on
over the next three days.

288
00:29:16.753 --> 00:29:18.387
Look, Inspector, all we want you to do

289
00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:20.055
is pass this picture out to your men.

290
00:29:20.088 --> 00:29:22.991

at our hotel. Simple.

with me for an interview.

just calm down, okay?

No, I'm not.

311

If we have to fight for her,

312
00:30:13.609 --> 00:30:16.913
then both of us will be
thrown out of the kumite.

313
00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:19.415
Just for her?

314
00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:23.319
We could arrange this another way.

00:30:25.487 --> 00:30:26.488

you close your hand,

you know what you're doing.

a story on the kumite.

He told me I had nice legs.

339
00:31:47.169 --> 00:31:49.138
He's right about that.

340
00:31:49.171 --> 00:31:52.474
Why is it that no one
will talk about the kumite?

341
00:31:52.508 --> 00:31:54.510
What is this air of mystery?

342
00:31:54.543 --> 00:31:57.479
I'm just trying to find
out what it's all about.

343

344
00:32:00.349 --> 00:32:01.683

manhood to the world?

not for the people
who read newspapers.
