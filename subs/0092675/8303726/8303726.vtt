01:27:11.208 --> 01:27:13.500
He's not going to show.

692
01:27:13.667 --> 01:27:15.667
Looks like he did it to us again, huh?

[FRANK WHISTLES]

694
01:27:18.708 --> 01:27:19.667
FRANK: Hey, guys!

695
01:27:19.833 --> 01:27:21.708
You coming or what?

696
01:27:21.875 --> 01:27:23.375
[HELMER CHUCKLES]

697
01:27:23.542 --> 01:27:25.667
You son of a bitch.

698
01:27:25.833 --> 01:27:28.250
You're always late!

699
01:27:32.708 --> 01:27:36.083
You know, you're really
a pain in the ass, you know that?

700
01:27:38.833 --> 01:27:41.167
I'm just glad you're on our side, kid.
