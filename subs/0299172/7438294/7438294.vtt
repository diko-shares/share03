1
00:00:09.635 --> 00:00:13.388
Out in the land
Where the men are tough as cactus

2
00:00:13.472 --> 00:00:17.643
Out in the land
Where the wild, wild West was won

3
00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:22.397
Out in the land of the desperado
If you're as soft as an avocado

4
00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:24.358
You're guacamole, son!

5
00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:27.778
Home, this ain't it, pal
Home on the range

6
00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:31.323
Home, better go git, pal
You ain't home on the range

7
00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:35.244
Out in the land
Where the weak are target practice

8
00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:39.456
Out in the land
Where they shoot the mild and meek

9
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.708
Out where the bad
Are a whole lot badder

10
00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:44.461
If you're the type
With a nervous bladder

11
00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:46.713
Your saddle's gonna reek!

12
00:00:46.797 --> 00:00:49.591
Cause you ain't home on the range

13
00:00:49.675 --> 00:00:53.637
Cowboy, you're really up the creek

14
00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:56.431
Come on, girl!

15
00:00:57.683 --> 00:00:59.560
Howdy, sheriff!

16
00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:11.321
Home on the range.

17
00:01:11.363 --> 00:01:14.950
Once upon a time,
I had a home on the range.

18
00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:17.160
But not anymore.

19
00:01:18.287 --> 00:01:21.832
It's no use crying over spilled milk.

20
00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:24.334
Speaking of which, that's me.

21
00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:25.836
I'm the cow.

22
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.422
Yeah, they're real.

23
00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:30.757
Quit staring.

24
00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:33.010
I'm sort of between homes right now.

25
00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.761
I lost my old place,

26
00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:38.557
thanks to the meanest bunch
of cattle rustlers in the West.

27
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.436
Alameda Slim
and the Willie Brothers gang.

28
00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:53.363
Somehow they stole the whole herd
from right under our noses.

29
00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:56.366
They disappeared without a trace.

30
00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:05.667
After that, poor old Abner
couldn't afford to keep the place.

31
00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:08.461
Or me either, for that matter.

32
00:02:13.383 --> 00:02:15.719
Well, no matter how bad things get,

33
00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:18.388
there's probably somebody worse off.

34
00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:23.977
That guy, for instance.

35
00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:27.397
Take a look at your new home.

36
00:02:28.607 --> 00:02:30.526
A dairy farm!

37
00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:32.611
Now we're talking.

38
00:02:32.653 --> 00:02:35.030
Hope it's not
one of them fat-free places.

39
00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:42.704
I know a place
Pretty as pie

40
00:02:42.788 --> 00:02:47.084
Out where the river bend
Hits up with the end of the sky

41
00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:52.005
It's left of Nebraska
And over a crest

42
00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:56.051
On a little patch of heaven
Way out west

43
00:02:56.093 --> 00:02:58.512
Everything's green

44
00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:01.014
Know what I mean?

45
00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:05.686
Darlin', it's quite the sweetest sight
That you ever done seen

46
00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.649
Ain't nothing much out there
Just life at its best

47
00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:15.487
On a little patch of heaven
Way out west

48
00:03:15.571 --> 00:03:20.409
Bees by the dozen
Are buzzing real peaceful

49
00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:24.830
Every bluebonnet, doggone it
Smells nice

50
00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:29.126
Even the tumbling tumbleweed
Slows down to match your speed

51
00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.796
On my tiny half an acre of paradise

52
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.759
Darlin', I swear
Once you been there

53
00:03:37.843 --> 00:03:42.306
There ain't a view beneath the blue
That could ever compare

54
00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:47.436
The only thing missing
Is you as my guest

55
00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.940
On a little patch of heaven
Way out west

56
00:03:52.024 --> 00:03:59.072
Why don't you come visit?
There's room in the nest

57
00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:04.328
On that little patch of heaven
Way out west

58
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:19.384
That's my boy.

59
00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:22.095
- Can hog!
- Don't yell at me.

60
00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:26.391
The call of duty.
Why don't you handle this one, Grace?

61
00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:29.436
It's time I gave you
more responsibility on the farm.

62
00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:31.355
Really?

63
00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:34.566
Thanks, Mrs. C.
I'll make you proud.

64
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.653
Get off my case,
little cocktail wieners!

65
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.281
I'm sensing a lot
of negative energy here.

66
00:04:41.365 --> 00:04:43.617
That's our can. And Jeb took it.

67
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.119
And now he says it's his can.

68
00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:48.914
Now, let's not play
the shame and blame game.

69
00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:53.377
This is an organic problem,
and there's a holistic solution.

70
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.131
You don't get this whole farm concept
do you, sister?

71
00:04:58.173 --> 00:04:59.925
Kill the goat!

72
00:05:03.637 --> 00:05:06.431
- Give me the can!
- Come here, you little...

73
00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:10.060
We're sorry, Mrs. Caloway.

74
00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:13.146
Piggies, why can't you leave Jeb alone?

75
00:05:13.188 --> 00:05:14.231
Why can't ya?

76
00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:17.150
The poor old goat
needs peace and quiet!

77
00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:19.778
- That's right. I need it!
- So, run along.

78
00:05:19.862 --> 00:05:21.280
Take your can with you.

79
00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:23.282
You take that can and... hey!

80
00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:25.534
Come back here,
you little bacon bits!

81
00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:28.370
Don't you have enough cans
of your own?

82
00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:31.164
No, not really.

83
00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:33.917
I'd be happy to take her in, Abner.

84
00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:36.879
There's always room for one more.

85
00:05:36.962 --> 00:05:39.882
Thanks, Pearl.
I gotta warn you, though.

86
00:05:39.965 --> 00:05:42.509
She's a bit headstrong.

87
00:05:42.593 --> 00:05:44.845
Now don't you worry, Abner.

88
00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:47.181
I'm sure she'll fit right in.

89
00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:49.850
So long, Pearl.
You take care now.

90
00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:58.275
There's a newcomer at the gate!

91
00:05:58.358 --> 00:05:59.484
Not now, Audrey.

92
00:05:59.568 --> 00:06:03.405
- But it's a great big...
- Everybody! This here is Maggie.

93
00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:11.622
Three-time winner
of the Golden Udder Award.

94
00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:14.666
And the original Miss Happy Heifer.

95
00:06:15.292 --> 00:06:17.211
A show cow?

96
00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:19.254
On Patch of Heaven?

97
00:06:32.518 --> 00:06:35.395
Now, I want y'all
to make her feel right at home.

98
00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:37.231
You hear me?

99
00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:39.399
Hey, thanks, everybody!

100
00:06:39.483 --> 00:06:42.611
It's great to be here
in Patch of Heaven.

101
00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:44.821
Don't everybody speak at one time.

102
00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:47.115
What is this, the frozen food section?

103
00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:51.286
Is this thing on?

104
00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:54.248
Good morning, Margaret.

105
00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:58.293
What a wonderful surprise to find
a fellow bovine joining the ranks.

106
00:06:58.377 --> 00:07:00.295
Phony.

107
00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:02.589
- I'm Mrs. Caloway...
- Hi!

108
00:07:02.673 --> 00:07:05.175
...and this is Grace.

109
00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:08.262
No applause and trophies here,
I'm afraid.

110
00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:12.266
Just the fruits
of our good, honest labor.

111
00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:16.770
Working stiffs?
Boy, I remember those days.

112
00:07:16.854 --> 00:07:20.983
Wow!
You're the biggest cow I ever saw.

113
00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:23.861
If you're in charge,
I'll take that as a compliment.

114
00:07:23.944 --> 00:07:26.446
If you're not,
I guess I'll just have to sit on you.

115
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:27.573
Mom!

116
00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:30.200
I'm only kidding!

117
00:07:30.284 --> 00:07:34.121
Say, what is this
you've got jammed up in your ear?

118
00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:37.791
Here, have an apple, kid.

119
00:07:37.875 --> 00:07:40.210
Don't go near any luaus, though.

120
00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:44.339
Wait a minute.
I got something stuck in my ear.

121
00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:47.801
This one's for me.

122
00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:51.013
That was good.

123
00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:54.349
Awesome. Do it again!

124
00:07:54.433 --> 00:07:56.018
Come on!

125
00:07:59.021 --> 00:08:02.357
- That's so cool!
- Maggie's some fun, isn't she?

126
00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:06.904
Teaching pigs to throw food!
As if they weren't sloppy enough.

127
00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:09.448
I'm going long!

128
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:29.343
Dagnabit, Buck. Slow down.

129
00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:32.386
Who's up for a game of tin can tag?

130
00:08:32.471 --> 00:08:34.806
That can is a family heirloom.

131
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.601
Whoever wins is getting
a free tetanus shot.

132
00:08:38.352 --> 00:08:39.937
Superstar, coming through!

133
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.648
Awesome!

134
00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:46.527
- No autographs, please.
- I got your autograph, pal.

135
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.070
Who's the hot shot?

136
00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:49.613
It's Buck.

137
00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:51.156
City slicker.

138
00:08:53.367 --> 00:08:56.703
Dagnabit, Buck. Take it easy.
This ain't no rodeo.

139
00:08:56.787 --> 00:08:58.997
Why, good morning, Sam.

140
00:08:59.915 --> 00:09:02.501
Is that ornery horse
getting away from you again?

141
00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:04.336
Howdy, Pearl.

142
00:09:04.378 --> 00:09:06.964
I came out
to bring you another bank notice.

143
00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:08.674
This one'll be the last.

144
00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:12.010
Every time I get a weak harvest
they send me one of those.

145
00:09:12.094 --> 00:09:14.096
They'll get their money soon enough.

146
00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:19.685
It's a whole new shooting match now.
The bank's calling in everybody's debt.

147
00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:23.730
They're losing money something fierce
with all the cattlemen going under.

148
00:09:23.814 --> 00:09:25.941
If they don't get their money
in three days,

149
00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:28.068
they'll auction off Patch of Heaven.

150
00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:29.862
What?

151
00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:31.446
No.

152
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.907
But they can't take my place.

153
00:09:33.991 --> 00:09:37.244
Why, I've been here
through twisters, blizzards...

154
00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:42.249
Sam, this is my home.

155
00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:47.421
I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry.

156
00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:54.720
Sorry just ain't gonna save my farm.

157
00:09:58.599 --> 00:10:01.643
Buck, I hope you're proud of yourself.

158
00:10:01.727 --> 00:10:04.938
As a matter of fact, I am.
Thanks for checking.

159
00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:11.528
You know, Pearl,
it don't have to be this way.

160
00:10:11.612 --> 00:10:14.281
You've got the best livestock
in the county.

161
00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:17.910
All you gotta do is just sell off
a few of these critters...

162
00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:22.497
Stop right there, Sam.
They're family. You don't sell family!

163
00:10:22.581 --> 00:10:23.916
Hold your horses.

164
00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:28.337
You git before I start using words
no good woman should ever use.

165
00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.923
- Don't bust a gusset, woman!
- Go on, Sam.

166
00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:34.176
It is still my property.
Now git!

167
00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:35.928
I said, git!

168
00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:38.597
I was just trying to help.

169
00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:50.943
That sure took the starch
right out of me.

170
00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:02.621
I'm sorry, girls.

171
00:11:03.539 --> 00:11:06.750
I'm just plum out of ideas.

172
00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:20.848
I think we all know what happens now.

173
00:11:20.931 --> 00:11:23.392
- Jeb, don't start!
- Now we all get eaten.

174
00:11:24.268 --> 00:11:27.062
What? You don't think
people in town eat animals?

175
00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:29.898
But who would eat a chicken?

176
00:11:29.982 --> 00:11:32.651
Come on, guys.
There must be something we can do.

177
00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:34.736
What could we do?

178
00:11:36.488 --> 00:11:38.490
This just isn't fair!

179
00:11:38.574 --> 00:11:42.452
- Fair! Good call, Curly!
- Ollie.

180
00:11:42.536 --> 00:11:44.663
- Ollie.
- What is?

181
00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:50.460
Listen, what would you say if I told you
that you could win big money

182
00:11:50.544 --> 00:11:55.591
and see beautiful downtown Chugwater
if you went to the county fair?

183
00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:01.096
- Thank you for your input...
- Come on, let the new cow talk!

184
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.098
New cow!

185
00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:08.103
Come on, Mrs. C.
You got a real good-looking bunch here.

186
00:12:08.187 --> 00:12:10.189
I see some real potential!

187
00:12:10.272 --> 00:12:11.565
Shucks!

188
00:12:11.648 --> 00:12:14.735
Now, the fair is two weeks away.
I say we go to town,

189
00:12:14.818 --> 00:12:18.614
butter up that sheriff's horse,
and get him to give us more time.

190
00:12:18.697 --> 00:12:21.950
- What are we waiting for? Let's go.
- That's right.

191
00:12:22.034 --> 00:12:23.327
What do you say, Caloway?

192
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.038
Absolutely not.

193
00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:30.083
I won't abandon Pearl in her hour
of need for such a ridiculous plan.

194
00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:33.045
She would be devastated
if she found us missing.

195
00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:35.631
As far as I'm concerned,
that's not an option.

196
00:12:35.714 --> 00:12:38.800
All right, suit yourself.

197
00:12:38.884 --> 00:12:41.803
Come on, Grace,
we've got a farm to save.

198
00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:47.893
You'll have to excuse her.
She's just a little tense.

199
00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:51.605
Tense! What's her specialty?
Sour cream?

200
00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:59.071
Going to town!
Of all the ill-conceived...

201
00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:06.119
Now, don't look at me so crossly.
I know what you're going to say.

202
00:13:06.203 --> 00:13:09.706
That Maggie and Grace will need someone
with my eye for detail

203
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.125
to keep them on the straight and narrow.

204
00:13:13.794 --> 00:13:16.672
Say no more, I'll go.

205
00:13:16.755 --> 00:13:19.466
Now, no mushy goodbyes,
my little ones.

206
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:23.262
You know how I get
about overly emotional displays.

207
00:13:27.683 --> 00:13:31.979
What made you change your mind?

208
00:13:32.062 --> 00:13:34.731
- I'd rather not talk about it.
- It's a chick thing.

209
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:41.113
- Good luck, girls!
- See ya!

210
00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:42.781
- Bye!
- They're stew meat.

211
00:13:42.865 --> 00:13:44.700
Hurry back.

212
00:13:58.172 --> 00:14:03.010
She'll be coming 'round the mountain
She'll be coming 'round the mountain

213
00:14:03.093 --> 00:14:04.887
She'll be coming...

214
00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:08.390
She better hurry around that mountain.
I can't take this much longer.

215
00:14:08.473 --> 00:14:10.893
Maggie, may I be frank?

216
00:14:10.976 --> 00:14:13.812
Only if you let me wear the hat.

217
00:14:14.938 --> 00:14:17.524
Lowbrow remarks may work for you,

218
00:14:17.608 --> 00:14:21.111
but we prefer the gentle approach.

219
00:14:21.195 --> 00:14:23.488
Well, she better
stick a sock in it soon.

220
00:14:23.572 --> 00:14:26.450
The vultures are starting to circle.

221
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:30.078
She's not dying!

222
00:14:30.162 --> 00:14:33.165
You sure?
We could wait around.

223
00:14:33.207 --> 00:14:35.959
...no, nothing
When she sees Grandma

224
00:14:36.043 --> 00:14:38.128
No more food for her

225
00:14:38.212 --> 00:14:39.922
We'll keep you posted.

226
00:14:40.005 --> 00:14:43.008
- False alarm, Clem.
- Roger dodger.

227
00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:47.888
How do we find the sheriff's office
when we get to town?

228
00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:51.600
Elementary, my dear Grace.
If we find Buck, we find the sheriff.

229
00:14:51.683 --> 00:14:55.229
That horse is a legend in his own mind.

230
00:15:11.912 --> 00:15:14.206
So, you think you got the drop on me?

231
00:15:14.248 --> 00:15:15.582
Think again!

232
00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:37.521
Jump back. Kiss myself!

233
00:15:38.689 --> 00:15:41.275
Earth to Buck!

234
00:15:42.776 --> 00:15:44.486
It's your move.

235
00:15:51.285 --> 00:15:53.287
Great.

236
00:15:54.288 --> 00:15:57.124
You were sleep-fighting again.
Almost threw a shoe.

237
00:15:57.207 --> 00:15:58.709
Sorry.

238
00:15:58.792 --> 00:16:04.506
It seems like all the other horses
are fighting bad guys and taking names.

239
00:16:05.299 --> 00:16:08.927
Watch out, sucker!
Who put this here?

240
00:16:09.011 --> 00:16:14.016
Buck, this ain't no Dodge City,
but we get our share of excitement.

241
00:16:14.975 --> 00:16:18.270
Been waiting a long time
to give you this.

242
00:16:18.312 --> 00:16:20.147
Telegram.

243
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.983
Howdy, Morris.
What you got there?

244
00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:26.945
"Got Evil Eye Joe. Stop.
Bringing him today. Stop.

245
00:16:27.029 --> 00:16:30.240
"Have money ready.
Signed, Rico."

246
00:16:32.576 --> 00:16:34.703
Rico caught another one already.

247
00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:37.039
Might as well give him
the key to my safe.

248
00:16:37.122 --> 00:16:39.791
Hear that, Rusty? Rico's coming.

249
00:16:39.875 --> 00:16:42.503
Yeah. I'm old. I ain't deaf.

250
00:16:42.586 --> 00:16:46.423
Boy, wouldn't that be the life?
Riding with Rico. Cleaning up the West.

251
00:16:46.507 --> 00:16:48.509
Kicking bad-guy behind!

252
00:16:49.468 --> 00:16:51.553
Watch out, sucker!

253
00:16:58.352 --> 00:17:01.230
All right, girls. We're going in.

254
00:17:02.523 --> 00:17:05.317
Look, there's no fences.

255
00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:07.611
What keeps the people from roaming?

256
00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:09.445
They appear to be domesticated.

257
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.031
It doesn't feel dangerous at all.

258
00:17:12.115 --> 00:17:15.368
It's perfectly safe.
Quiet as the farm at milking time.

259
00:17:16.036 --> 00:17:18.288
- What was that?
- It's a gunfight.

260
00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.089
- Hit the dirt.
- Who lives like this?

261
00:17:27.172 --> 00:17:30.342
- What do we do?
- There's a star on that door.

262
00:17:30.384 --> 00:17:33.095
That must be the sheriff's office.
Move, lady!

263
00:17:34.388 --> 00:17:37.140
Swivel your hips
Give 'em a grind

264
00:17:37.224 --> 00:17:40.602
Shimmy, shake
And leave your troubles behind

265
00:17:46.066 --> 00:17:48.402
Get those cows off the stage!

266
00:17:49.778 --> 00:17:52.406
- Maybe we came at a bad time.
- Charge!

267
00:18:00.414 --> 00:18:02.624
How dare you!

268
00:18:09.548 --> 00:18:11.300
- Daddy!
- Son!

269
00:18:17.764 --> 00:18:19.266
I say!

270
00:18:21.476 --> 00:18:22.686
What did I do?

271
00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:28.859
That does it!

272
00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:32.070
Hoof it on out of here, ladies.
Go on.

273
00:18:32.154 --> 00:18:35.949
Come back! That was
the best dang show we ever had.

274
00:18:36.033 --> 00:18:38.452
You've been on the trail too long,
you old coot.

275
00:18:39.203 --> 00:18:41.538
What kind of sheriff's office is that?

276
00:18:41.622 --> 00:18:45.459
Dancing girls, gambling...
How does he ever get any work done?

277
00:18:45.501 --> 00:18:50.088
If that's the sheriff's office,
this town rocks!

278
00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:54.510
If it isn't three maids a milkin'!

279
00:18:54.593 --> 00:18:58.347
You girls are a little far from home,
aren't you?

280
00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:00.766
If it isn't the phony express.

281
00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:03.519
We want a word with you about this.

282
00:19:05.312 --> 00:19:07.022
- What's that?
- What is that?

283
00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:10.108
I believe you left this on our farm.

284
00:19:10.192 --> 00:19:12.569
Wait a minute...

285
00:19:12.653 --> 00:19:14.821
The place went bankrupt.

286
00:19:14.905 --> 00:19:18.700
- Your farm is history.
- Don't you heifers get it?

287
00:19:18.784 --> 00:19:20.452
Hold on, you two!

288
00:19:20.494 --> 00:19:24.456
Give us two more weeks,
and we'll have at least 60 bucks...

289
00:19:24.498 --> 00:19:26.917
You got three days to pay
or get on your way.

290
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.002
And 60 bucks don't cut it.

291
00:19:29.086 --> 00:19:31.088
Looks like you need about...

292
00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.507
I'd say...

293
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.426
750 of 'em.

294
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:38.762
Where are we gonna get all that money?

295
00:19:38.846 --> 00:19:42.474
Maybe Maggie can just
pull it out of her ear.

296
00:19:42.516 --> 00:19:44.893
Watch it, Caloway.

297
00:19:50.732 --> 00:19:51.733
Rico!

298
00:20:13.046 --> 00:20:15.007
Who is that?

299
00:20:17.843 --> 00:20:18.844
Sorry.

300
00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.683
Don't you know a hero
when you see one?

301
00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:26.435
That's Rico!

302
00:20:26.518 --> 00:20:29.521
The best dang bounty hunter
this side of the Pecos.

303
00:20:29.605 --> 00:20:34.193
I could guess from here to tomorrow,
but I don't know how you do it.

304
00:20:35.194 --> 00:20:37.738
Where's my money?

305
00:20:37.821 --> 00:20:40.115
I got it right here for you.

306
00:20:40.199 --> 00:20:42.743
Hey, they're giving away free money.

307
00:20:43.785 --> 00:20:45.829
So, who else is out there?

308
00:20:45.913 --> 00:20:50.209
The only varmint left is that lowdown,
good-for-nothing Alameda Slim.

309
00:20:50.292 --> 00:20:52.127
Cattle rustler.

310
00:20:52.211 --> 00:20:55.589
- What's the bounty?
- $750.

311
00:20:56.715 --> 00:20:58.175
I got it!

312
00:20:58.217 --> 00:21:00.761
Why don't we nab that Alameda Slim

313
00:21:00.844 --> 00:21:03.388
and use the reward money
to save the farm?

314
00:21:03.472 --> 00:21:06.183
That is a sensible idea.

315
00:21:06.225 --> 00:21:08.227
I knew you'd love it.

316
00:21:09.269 --> 00:21:11.980
Don't they have sarcasm
where you come from?

317
00:21:12.064 --> 00:21:15.317
Wake up and smell the alfalfa!
It's perfect.

318
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.237
I'm gonna need a fresh horse.

319
00:21:19.446 --> 00:21:23.200
A horse? Let me think...

320
00:21:23.242 --> 00:21:26.954
I reckon you'd want a fast horse.
Real fast?

321
00:21:27.037 --> 00:21:32.292
He'd also have to be able to go for days
without food or drink.

322
00:21:32.376 --> 00:21:35.838
Stealthy.
Sure-footed in any terrain.

323
00:21:38.298 --> 00:21:39.341
Look at me!

324
00:21:39.424 --> 00:21:40.968
What about that horse?

325
00:21:41.051 --> 00:21:43.220
You mean Buck, here?

326
00:21:43.262 --> 00:21:49.017
I don't know. Buck's fast, all right.
But he's kind of a handful.

327
00:21:49.101 --> 00:21:50.227
He'll do.

328
00:21:51.228 --> 00:21:53.021
Suit yourself.

329
00:21:54.022 --> 00:21:55.065
Hey, Rusty!

330
00:21:55.148 --> 00:21:59.278
I'm wearing Rico's saddle.
I'm wearing Rico's saddle!

331
00:21:59.444 --> 00:22:01.864
Great, I'll leave you two alone.

332
00:22:01.947 --> 00:22:03.740
No.

333
00:22:03.824 --> 00:22:07.494
There's no way in heaven or earth
that cows can catch an outlaw.

334
00:22:07.578 --> 00:22:12.291
Look, all we've got to do is follow
this chuck wagon to a cattle drive.

335
00:22:13.667 --> 00:22:17.921
Then we let the bad guys come to us.

336
00:22:18.463 --> 00:22:22.593
We've no reason to believe this
chuck wagon is headed to a cattle drive.

337
00:22:22.676 --> 00:22:25.888
Tommy, have fun on that cattle drive!

338
00:22:25.971 --> 00:22:27.931
All right, Dan.

339
00:22:28.807 --> 00:22:32.144
I think it is headed
toward a cattle drive...

340
00:22:32.227 --> 00:22:35.147
We're not following this wagon
and that is final.

341
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:38.025
Come on. It'll be fun!

342
00:22:38.942 --> 00:22:41.278
- Did you just hit me?
- Kinda.

343
00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.405
- Stop it!
- Why?

344
00:22:43.488 --> 00:22:45.324
Because I don't like it.

345
00:22:56.043 --> 00:22:58.045
No, not the hat.

346
00:22:58.128 --> 00:23:00.088
What about the hat?

347
00:23:06.345 --> 00:23:10.057
All right, violence is not going
to solve anything.

348
00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:13.352
Why don't we all
take a deep cleansing breath...

349
00:23:17.356 --> 00:23:19.358
Hey now, mud wrestling.

350
00:23:20.817 --> 00:23:22.361
Watch the saddle.

351
00:23:26.907 --> 00:23:29.326
What in tarnation...

352
00:23:29.368 --> 00:23:33.205
Maggie, for the last time,
I will not be roped into this scheme.

353
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:37.334
Come on, you crazy heifers.

354
00:23:37.376 --> 00:23:39.294
Dagnabit.

355
00:23:39.378 --> 00:23:42.339
Hey, partner, curb your livestock.

356
00:23:42.381 --> 00:23:44.049
This town is clean.

357
00:23:48.428 --> 00:23:51.723
Not exactly what I had in mind,
but this'll work.

358
00:23:51.807 --> 00:23:54.351
It doesn't work for me.

359
00:23:54.393 --> 00:23:56.603
Adios. Take care of Rico now!

360
00:23:59.398 --> 00:24:01.400
Hasta la vista, heifers!

361
00:24:06.738 --> 00:24:09.741
Give me a home

362
00:24:09.825 --> 00:24:12.870
Where the buffalo roam

363
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:19.334
And the antelope play

364
00:24:19.418 --> 00:24:22.296
Where seldom is heard

365
00:24:22.379 --> 00:24:25.257
A discouraging word

366
00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:30.220
And the skies are not cloudy
All day

367
00:24:33.307 --> 00:24:36.476
Home, home on the range...

368
00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.978
What was that?

369
00:24:38.061 --> 00:24:40.564
It's a farm auction, ladies.

370
00:24:40.647 --> 00:24:43.984
That's the last of the furniture.
Final item to be auctioned

371
00:24:44.067 --> 00:24:48.405
is this piece of real property,
known heretofore as the Dixon Farm.

372
00:24:48.447 --> 00:24:50.365
Do I hear...

373
00:24:52.451 --> 00:24:55.412
What's going to happen to the cow
who lived there?

374
00:24:55.454 --> 00:24:57.956
- She'll be okay.
- How do you know?

375
00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.374
You're looking at her.

376
00:24:59.458 --> 00:25:01.251
This was your farm?

377
00:25:03.003 --> 00:25:06.507
We had like a family, too.

378
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:09.968
- What happened?
- Alameda Slim happened.

379
00:25:17.476 --> 00:25:19.978
Sold to Mr. Yancy O'Del.

380
00:25:20.062 --> 00:25:22.439
Pleasure doing business with you.

381
00:25:37.496 --> 00:25:38.830
Cattle drive. Told ya.

382
00:25:38.914 --> 00:25:41.458
- You both owe me a dollar.
- Step lightly, girls.

383
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:45.462
The male of the species
can be extremely hostile.

384
00:25:45.504 --> 00:25:49.550
Come on, Caloway. It's not like
they haven't seen a cow before.

385
00:25:51.844 --> 00:25:53.554
Hey, Barry!

386
00:25:55.514 --> 00:25:57.933
Check it out.

387
00:25:58.016 --> 00:25:59.935
Dairy cows!

388
00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.188
Hi, how's it going?

389
00:26:04.022 --> 00:26:07.150
Hello. Let me guess,
you're a Taurus.

390
00:26:07.234 --> 00:26:10.821
Just keep moving
and avoid eye contact.

391
00:26:12.281 --> 00:26:15.784
Pardon me, but what are three
lovely ladies like you...

392
00:26:15.868 --> 00:26:18.287
Doing on a drive like this?

393
00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:20.831
Just ignore them
and perhaps they'll go away.

394
00:26:20.914 --> 00:26:24.168
They seem like nice guys.
Maybe they can help us.

395
00:26:24.251 --> 00:26:26.170
Sure, we can help you.

396
00:26:26.253 --> 00:26:28.672
Maybe we can help each other?

397
00:26:30.674 --> 00:26:34.511
Look, lover-bull,
we're here strictly on business.

398
00:26:34.553 --> 00:26:38.056
Sounds pretty exciting.
What kind of business?

399
00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:42.477
We're looking for a cattle rustler
named Alameda Slim.

400
00:26:42.561 --> 00:26:44.521
It doesn't hurt to ask.

401
00:26:44.563 --> 00:26:46.273
Slim?

402
00:26:46.356 --> 00:26:50.986
Why, Slim's just a scary bedtime story
to get little calves to behave.

403
00:26:56.283 --> 00:26:58.952
- What was that?
- It must be Slim and the Willies.

404
00:26:59.036 --> 00:27:00.537
Slim and the Willies!

405
00:27:00.579 --> 00:27:03.540
No worry, darlin'. I'll protect you.

406
00:27:03.582 --> 00:27:06.418
You have exactly two seconds
to remove your hoof

407
00:27:06.502 --> 00:27:08.545
before I snap it off at the knee.

408
00:27:08.587 --> 00:27:11.507
Sorry, ma'am,
I thought you were the blonde.

409
00:27:16.136 --> 00:27:18.889
Come on, girls.
It's time to lose these ropes.

410
00:27:21.391 --> 00:27:23.936
- Maggie, I'm stuck.
- Look out!

411
00:27:31.777 --> 00:27:35.280
It's payback time. Cover me!

412
00:27:35.364 --> 00:27:37.574
- With what?
- Howdy, Slim!

413
00:27:37.616 --> 00:27:40.202
Be quiet, you fools.
We've got work to do.

414
00:27:40.285 --> 00:27:42.162
Listen up.

415
00:27:42.246 --> 00:27:46.500
There are crooks in this here West,
who have claimed to be the best

416
00:27:46.583 --> 00:27:49.628
and they think they wrote the book
on how to rustle.

417
00:27:50.629 --> 00:27:54.132
As good as they may be,
not a one's as good as me.

418
00:27:54.216 --> 00:27:57.636
And I barely have to move
A single muscle

419
00:27:57.678 --> 00:28:02.474
They call me mean, boys
Depraved and nasty too

420
00:28:02.558 --> 00:28:07.354
And they ain't seen, boys
The cruelest thing I do

421
00:28:07.437 --> 00:28:08.814
You see, I...

422
00:28:12.109 --> 00:28:15.362
The sweetest way of rustlin'
Yet devised

423
00:28:15.445 --> 00:28:16.530
'Cause when I...

424
00:28:20.117 --> 00:28:23.871
Why lookee how them cows
Get hypnotized

425
00:28:23.954 --> 00:28:25.706
- He don't prod
- He don't yell

426
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:27.457
Still he drives them dogies well

427
00:28:27.541 --> 00:28:32.087
Which ain't easy when your chaps
Are labeled XXXXL

428
00:28:32.129 --> 00:28:35.090
If you're looking
From a bovine point of view

429
00:28:35.132 --> 00:28:36.508
I sure can...

430
00:28:44.725 --> 00:28:49.313
Here we go, boys!
5,000 cattle in the side pocket.

431
00:29:17.216 --> 00:29:21.261
Maggie, Mrs. Caloway.
Snap out of it!

432
00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.015
The sound that cattle
Truly take to heart

433
00:29:25.098 --> 00:29:26.433
Yeah, I can...

434
00:29:29.436 --> 00:29:32.773
And smack my big ol' rump
If that ain't art

435
00:29:32.856 --> 00:29:35.192
- He don't rope
- Not a chance

436
00:29:35.234 --> 00:29:37.194
He just puts 'em in a trance

437
00:29:37.236 --> 00:29:41.532
He's a pioneer Pied Piper
In ten-gallon underpants

438
00:29:41.615 --> 00:29:44.451
I'm the real rip-roarin' deal
To those who moo

439
00:29:44.535 --> 00:29:46.203
Thanks to my...

440
00:29:49.706 --> 00:29:52.459
I got cattle out the old wazoo!

441
00:29:52.543 --> 00:29:54.253
'Cause I can...

442
00:30:19.152 --> 00:30:23.156
You just been a second earlier,
you'd a had that rustler dead to rights.

443
00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:25.242
You boys see anything
before I got here?

444
00:30:25.325 --> 00:30:28.745
We sure did.
We were just setting down to supper,

445
00:30:28.829 --> 00:30:31.832
when all of a sudden
the lights went out.

446
00:30:31.915 --> 00:30:36.378
All right, what part of "cover me"
didn't we understand?

447
00:30:36.461 --> 00:30:38.422
- You guys okay?
- I don't know.

448
00:30:38.505 --> 00:30:41.008
I feel like I was dreaming.

449
00:30:41.091 --> 00:30:45.220
Slim started singing and all of a sudden
I lost track of everything.

450
00:30:45.262 --> 00:30:47.806
Singing?
That didn't sound like singing to me.

451
00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:51.185
And you know I have perfect pitch.

452
00:30:51.268 --> 00:30:53.228
Grace, about your perfect pitch...

453
00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:55.981
- Not now.
- All right, show's over!

454
00:30:57.274 --> 00:31:00.319
You're interfering
with official police business.

455
00:31:00.402 --> 00:31:03.238
Be right with you, big guy!

456
00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:06.241
Buck is on the case, you know.

457
00:31:06.283 --> 00:31:09.953
Don't embarrass me
in front of my partner, please!

458
00:31:10.037 --> 00:31:12.331
You and he are partners?

459
00:31:13.582 --> 00:31:15.501
How does that work exactly?

460
00:31:15.584 --> 00:31:19.254
I mean, do you get to ride him
on odd days, or even?

461
00:31:19.296 --> 00:31:22.216
He chose me specifically
because I have skills

462
00:31:22.299 --> 00:31:25.177
that are essential
to capturing our quarry.

463
00:31:37.314 --> 00:31:39.316
You boys headed back to town?

464
00:31:39.399 --> 00:31:42.277
Yes, sir. We gotta go file
a report with the sheriff.

465
00:31:42.319 --> 00:31:46.448
Give him back his horse.
This one's too skittish around cows.

466
00:31:46.532 --> 00:31:50.285
And that, girls,
is what makes me and Rico

467
00:31:50.327 --> 00:31:54.540
equal parts of one lean, mean,
crime-fighting...

468
00:31:58.418 --> 00:32:00.003
...machine?

469
00:32:02.339 --> 00:32:04.800
There it is, then.

470
00:32:05.425 --> 00:32:09.263
Well, stud...

471
00:32:09.346 --> 00:32:10.514
I'm no professional,

472
00:32:10.597 --> 00:32:16.061
but I'd say the only mano y mano
you'll be doing is in your dreams.

473
00:32:16.144 --> 00:32:19.356
Look out, Buck!
He's making a move on your left flank.

474
00:32:21.358 --> 00:32:23.360
Leave that poor animal alone.

475
00:32:26.446 --> 00:32:28.699
I realize you're very upset,

476
00:32:28.782 --> 00:32:32.202
but if you'd like to join our group
and help us bring in Slim,

477
00:32:32.286 --> 00:32:34.288
we'd be happy to have you.

478
00:32:34.371 --> 00:32:38.333
However, there are a few
anger management issues

479
00:32:38.375 --> 00:32:40.169
we need to discuss.

480
00:32:40.252 --> 00:32:44.381
I wouldn't help you bossy bovines
if my life depended on it.

481
00:32:44.464 --> 00:32:47.426
See, that's just what I'm talking about.

482
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:49.344
Bye.

483
00:32:51.889 --> 00:32:54.391
"Come on, girls.
Let's go get Slim."

484
00:32:54.433 --> 00:32:56.518
Cud-chewing heifers!

485
00:32:56.602 --> 00:33:00.689
I can catch that Slim
with one hoof tied behind my back.

486
00:33:00.772 --> 00:33:03.400
Wait a minute. Why don't I?

487
00:33:04.359 --> 00:33:07.613
Partner or no partner,
that's what I'll do.

488
00:33:13.577 --> 00:33:15.370
Forget it!

489
00:33:15.412 --> 00:33:17.289
Definitely bipolar.

490
00:33:17.372 --> 00:33:19.499
Move it, sister,
hero passing on the left!

491
00:33:19.583 --> 00:33:22.419
- Watch it!
- Where are you going, hot foot?

492
00:33:22.503 --> 00:33:26.381
I'm gonna go nab that rustler,
and show Rico I got what it takes.

493
00:33:26.423 --> 00:33:29.885
Say goodbye to your farm, girls,
'cause Slim is mine.

494
00:33:29.968 --> 00:33:32.387
It's hero time.
Watch out, now!

495
00:33:32.429 --> 00:33:35.432
Get back.
Jump back, kiss myself!

496
00:33:36.892 --> 00:33:39.394
This is a fine kettle of fish.

497
00:33:39.436 --> 00:33:41.396
How can we compete with that?

498
00:33:41.438 --> 00:33:46.151
Look at the bright side, Mrs. C.
Don't forget about our secret weapon.

499
00:33:46.235 --> 00:33:47.486
Secret weapon?

500
00:33:47.569 --> 00:33:50.155
Who better to catch a cattle thief
than a cow?

501
00:33:50.239 --> 00:33:53.951
Even you can't argue
with that kind of logic.

502
00:33:54.034 --> 00:33:55.619
Okay, maybe you can.

503
00:33:55.702 --> 00:34:00.374
You know, Grace,
Maggie does so love your singing.

504
00:34:00.457 --> 00:34:03.126
- How about a song?
- I'll get you for this.

505
00:34:09.466 --> 00:34:13.929
5,000 Texas Longhorns!
Not bad for one night's work.

506
00:34:14.096 --> 00:34:16.098
Pick a color.

507
00:34:16.181 --> 00:34:19.226
I said, "Not bad for one night's work."

508
00:34:20.726 --> 00:34:21.937
Thank you.

509
00:34:21.978 --> 00:34:24.481
And judging by the earmark,

510
00:34:24.565 --> 00:34:28.025
I'd say these are the last
of Big Mike Donald's herd.

511
00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:30.487
Big Mike Donald had a farm?

512
00:34:33.949 --> 00:34:36.618
That's right. He had a farm.

513
00:34:36.702 --> 00:34:39.413
Now that all his cash cows
have disappeared

514
00:34:39.496 --> 00:34:41.665
that poor sap's gonna be flat broke.

515
00:34:41.748 --> 00:34:44.293
Perfect time
for a certain upstanding landowner

516
00:34:44.376 --> 00:34:47.337
to step in and take all the land.

517
00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:50.924
- Who are you?
- What did you do with Uncle Slim?

518
00:34:50.966 --> 00:34:53.719
Put up your dukes,
Mr. Fancy Britches.

519
00:34:54.969 --> 00:34:56.929
It's me. Hello.

520
00:34:56.972 --> 00:35:01.935
This is the disguise I use to sneak into
them auctions and buy all the land.

521
00:35:01.977 --> 00:35:03.979
You brainless, monotone monkeys.

522
00:35:04.062 --> 00:35:07.357
You gotta be the richest land baron
in the West.

523
00:35:08.108 --> 00:35:11.195
Yes, but the part
that really warms my heart,

524
00:35:11.278 --> 00:35:14.781
is watching those homesteaders suffer.

525
00:35:16.491 --> 00:35:20.579
Back in the day, I worked the
highfalutinest ranches you ever seen.

526
00:35:20.662 --> 00:35:24.958
But those stuck-up ranch bosses
couldn't appreciate my talents.

527
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.211
Maybe they just didn't like
your singing.

528
00:35:29.004 --> 00:35:31.006
My singing?

529
00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:34.718
Songbirds sing.

530
00:35:34.801 --> 00:35:37.262
Saloon gals sing.

531
00:35:37.346 --> 00:35:41.600
Little bitty snot-nosed children sing!

532
00:35:41.683 --> 00:35:45.687
I yodel and yodeling is an art.

533
00:35:45.771 --> 00:35:48.690
Maybe they just
didn't like your yodeling.

534
00:35:51.985 --> 00:35:54.071
He didn't mean it, Uncle Slim.

535
00:35:54.154 --> 00:35:57.616
Everybody likes yodeling.

536
00:35:57.699 --> 00:36:03.205
Why, it's one of the funniest,
cornball, goofy, silly sounds

537
00:36:03.288 --> 00:36:05.207
in the whole West.

538
00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:08.919
PATCH OF HEAVEN

539
00:36:13.382 --> 00:36:16.635
Am I correct in assuming
that each and every time

540
00:36:16.718 --> 00:36:19.471
we brought a herd back
to this secret lair,

541
00:36:19.555 --> 00:36:23.016
you've managed to sit
in the exact same spot,

542
00:36:23.058 --> 00:36:26.979
blocking that choice
piece of property from my view?

543
00:36:27.062 --> 00:36:29.982
This is my comfy place.

544
00:36:31.066 --> 00:36:32.651
What?

545
00:36:33.861 --> 00:36:35.904
It's called Patch of Heaven.

546
00:36:35.988 --> 00:36:38.490
Goes on auction Thursday morning.

547
00:36:38.574 --> 00:36:40.701
Perfect. Pencil it in.

548
00:36:40.784 --> 00:36:43.787
Thursday morning.
Right after we sell off this herd.

549
00:36:43.871 --> 00:36:46.290
But it's just a little ol' dirt farm.

550
00:36:46.373 --> 00:36:48.041
What's the difference?

551
00:36:48.083 --> 00:36:50.294
When you're talking revenge,

552
00:36:50.377 --> 00:36:54.590
every last acre counts.

553
00:37:10.772 --> 00:37:14.193
I don't get it.
Weren't the cows supposed to come back?

554
00:37:14.276 --> 00:37:17.613
Daddy, what's going to happen
if they don't come back?

555
00:37:17.696 --> 00:37:19.781
But they are coming back.

556
00:37:19.865 --> 00:37:22.618
Hogwash. We all know
they're never coming back.

557
00:37:22.701 --> 00:37:24.119
What?

558
00:37:25.537 --> 00:37:28.081
You don't know that.

559
00:37:28.123 --> 00:37:30.167
Everybody knows that bovines

560
00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:33.921
are the most intelligent,
crafty animals in the West.

561
00:37:34.004 --> 00:37:35.506
He's right, you know.

562
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:39.801
Doesn't take a cow to figure out
they saw the writing on the wall,

563
00:37:39.885 --> 00:37:42.179
and flown the coop
while the getting was good.

564
00:37:42.262 --> 00:37:43.263
What?

565
00:37:43.347 --> 00:37:46.350
No! They tricked us.
And deserted us!

566
00:37:46.433 --> 00:37:48.894
Run for your life!

567
00:37:48.977 --> 00:37:52.064
Excuse me!

568
00:37:52.147 --> 00:37:53.774
Excuse me!

569
00:37:59.613 --> 00:38:02.324
Let's not forget
who we're talking about.

570
00:38:03.408 --> 00:38:07.663
Remember when Grace helped you
figure out why you crossed the road?

571
00:38:08.997 --> 00:38:13.168
Mrs. Caloway knew what to do when
your head got stuck in that spittoon.

572
00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:14.628
Get off my case!

573
00:38:14.711 --> 00:38:17.798
Maggie was gonna make us all winners.

574
00:38:17.881 --> 00:38:23.053
I truly believe there ain't nothing
those three cows can't do.

575
00:38:32.104 --> 00:38:35.399
Whatever they're gonna do,
they better do it soon.

576
00:38:36.066 --> 00:38:38.819
I'm so very sorry, Pearl.

577
00:38:40.195 --> 00:38:43.198
It's a real shame. It is.

578
00:38:49.663 --> 00:38:54.459
I don't know what's worse,
losing my farm to the highest bidder

579
00:38:54.543 --> 00:39:00.174
or knowing that my girls are lost
and alone out there.

580
00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:06.471
Come on, girls.

581
00:39:06.555 --> 00:39:10.601
Either I'm getting good at this
or his scent is getting stronger.

582
00:39:10.684 --> 00:39:11.935
Go get him.

583
00:39:12.019 --> 00:39:14.771
- Look out, Slim.
- No, it can't be.

584
00:39:14.855 --> 00:39:16.231
We're on your trail.

585
00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:41.256
This has "Buck" written all over it.

586
00:39:41.298 --> 00:39:44.259
We're not going to let
this dumb old trick stop us.

587
00:39:44.301 --> 00:39:48.222
Sooner or later, all these paths
will hook up and then...

588
00:39:49.264 --> 00:39:51.183
No, the tracks!

589
00:39:51.266 --> 00:39:53.268
Hurry up, girls.
Don't lose that trail.

590
00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:56.605
What trail? I can't see anything.

591
00:39:58.273 --> 00:40:00.275
Look out!

592
00:40:03.529 --> 00:40:07.115
Flash flood! Get to high ground.

593
00:41:02.171 --> 00:41:04.298
Come on, girls, we can't give up.

594
00:41:04.339 --> 00:41:06.258
That's enough.

595
00:41:06.341 --> 00:41:07.926
The minute this lets up,

596
00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:11.013
we're heading straight home
to Patch of Heaven.

597
00:41:11.096 --> 00:41:13.932
What about catching Slim
and collecting the reward?

598
00:41:14.016 --> 00:41:16.727
We never had a prayer of catching Slim.

599
00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:18.353
This whole ridiculous plan

600
00:41:18.395 --> 00:41:22.566
is just so you can get revenge
on those cattle rustlers.

601
00:41:22.649 --> 00:41:25.944
For your information, Duchess,

602
00:41:26.028 --> 00:41:29.323
this whole ridiculous plan
is about us saving our farm.

603
00:41:29.364 --> 00:41:33.118
Our farm might've had a fighting chance
until you came along.

604
00:41:33.202 --> 00:41:34.786
What's that supposed to mean?

605
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:38.332
Strutting around
with your vulgar show cow behavior.

606
00:41:38.373 --> 00:41:39.499
I was just...

607
00:41:39.583 --> 00:41:42.252
Wasting our time
on your foolish plans.

608
00:41:42.336 --> 00:41:46.381
Patch of Heaven has survived
every hardship nature can dish out.

609
00:41:46.465 --> 00:41:51.595
But you are the biggest catastrophe
to ever hit our farm.

610
00:41:51.678 --> 00:41:53.805
If that's the way you feel about it,

611
00:41:53.889 --> 00:41:56.225
maybe we should just go
our separate ways.

612
00:41:56.308 --> 00:41:58.352
That's the first good idea you've had.

613
00:41:58.393 --> 00:41:59.561
Fine!

614
00:42:12.699 --> 00:42:13.951
Fine.

615
00:42:14.034 --> 00:42:18.413
It's not like your farm was ever
gonna feel like home to me anyway.

616
00:42:35.764 --> 00:42:40.727
Rain is pouring down
Like the heavens are hurting

617
00:42:40.811 --> 00:42:46.525
Seems like it's been dark
Since the devil knows when

618
00:42:46.608 --> 00:42:52.406
How do you go on
Never knowing for certain

619
00:42:52.447 --> 00:42:56.451
Will the sun ever shine again

620
00:42:57.327 --> 00:43:02.749
Feels like it's been years
Since it started to thunder

621
00:43:02.833 --> 00:43:08.130
Clouds are camping out
In the valley and glen

622
00:43:08.213 --> 00:43:14.052
How do you go on
When you can't help but wonder

623
00:43:14.136 --> 00:43:19.099
Will the sun ever shine again?

624
00:43:19.183 --> 00:43:24.479
What if the rain keeps falling

625
00:43:24.563 --> 00:43:29.818
What if the sky stays gray

626
00:43:29.902 --> 00:43:34.907
What if the winds keep squalling

627
00:43:36.241 --> 00:43:40.787
And never go away

628
00:43:40.871 --> 00:43:46.126
Maybe soon the storm
Will be tired of blowing

629
00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:51.048
Maybe soon it all will be over
Amen

630
00:43:51.131 --> 00:43:57.054
How do you go on
If there's no way of knowin'

631
00:43:57.137 --> 00:44:00.140
Will the sun ever shine

632
00:44:00.224 --> 00:44:03.685
Wish I could say

633
00:44:03.769 --> 00:44:09.358
Send me a sign
One little ray

634
00:44:09.441 --> 00:44:16.073
Lord, if you're listening
How long until then

635
00:44:18.325 --> 00:44:23.580
Will the sun ever shine again

636
00:45:00.325 --> 00:45:02.327
- Wake up.
- Check, please.

637
00:45:12.504 --> 00:45:14.506
Tasted a lot better in my sleep.

638
00:45:15.591 --> 00:45:17.593
I suppose you'll be off now.

639
00:45:18.719 --> 00:45:20.512
Where will you go?

640
00:45:20.596 --> 00:45:23.056
Probably check out the Grand Canyon.

641
00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:25.309
See Utah before I die.

642
00:45:25.392 --> 00:45:27.394
Wait a minute, where's Grace?

643
00:45:27.477 --> 00:45:30.230
Hi, there.
Boy, am I glad you guys are up.

644
00:45:30.314 --> 00:45:31.607
Come look at this.

645
00:45:31.648 --> 00:45:34.902
What on earth?
Where did this come from?

646
00:45:34.985 --> 00:45:39.198
It's green, it's leafy and it's free.
Shut up and eat.

647
00:45:39.281 --> 00:45:42.326
Good morning.
I see you tucked into your appetizer.

648
00:45:42.409 --> 00:45:44.745
Never knew a pretty lady
without an appetite.

649
00:45:44.828 --> 00:45:46.788
Now see here, you ruffian...

650
00:45:46.872 --> 00:45:49.374
He's not a ruffian.

651
00:45:49.458 --> 00:45:53.629
He's a genuine desert shaman.
Our very own wise man.

652
00:45:53.712 --> 00:45:56.507
Shaman, chef, chief cook
and bottle washer.

653
00:45:56.590 --> 00:45:59.301
I'm a jackrabbit of all trades
and at your service.

654
00:45:59.384 --> 00:46:02.054
Folks around these parts
call me "Lucky Jack."

655
00:46:02.721 --> 00:46:07.267
They used to come from miles around
for one rub of my lucky rabbit's foot.

656
00:46:07.809 --> 00:46:09.353
Dagnabit!

657
00:46:13.315 --> 00:46:15.651
This happens all the time.
Now where was I?

658
00:46:16.777 --> 00:46:18.320
Voilà.

659
00:46:18.403 --> 00:46:22.449
Now let me just get this on the fire
and it'll be ready directly.

660
00:46:25.536 --> 00:46:29.498
Look, we don't eat meat.
It's kinda like a professional courtesy.

661
00:46:29.581 --> 00:46:31.834
Perhaps we'll dine with you
some other time.

662
00:46:31.917 --> 00:46:36.213
You see, Grace and I are returning
to our farm to say our last goodbyes.

663
00:46:37.214 --> 00:46:39.091
We need closure.

664
00:46:39.174 --> 00:46:41.635
I can sympathize there, sister,
I truly can.

665
00:46:41.677 --> 00:46:45.305
Until recently, I too had a home.
Echo Mine, it was called.

666
00:46:45.389 --> 00:46:49.726
Us jackrabbits lived there
for generation after generation.

667
00:46:50.686 --> 00:46:53.981
Till some land-grabbing bandit
moved in,

668
00:46:54.064 --> 00:46:57.693
and flushed us out
like yesterday's oatmeal.

669
00:46:59.528 --> 00:47:02.155
Excuse us, my good fellow.
We must be on our way...

670
00:47:02.239 --> 00:47:04.032
Wait! There he is!

671
00:47:10.205 --> 00:47:11.498
Slim!

672
00:47:11.582 --> 00:47:16.170
You mean this no-good varmint
is hiding out in Echo Mine right now?

673
00:47:16.253 --> 00:47:18.922
- Without a doubt.
- What are you thinking?

674
00:47:19.006 --> 00:47:23.969
I got a score to settle with that
rhinestone fat boy, and nothing to lose.

675
00:47:24.052 --> 00:47:26.847
It'll be dangerous going after Slim
all by yourself.

676
00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:29.683
Hey, I got the rabbit.

677
00:47:30.434 --> 00:47:33.604
That's not all you got.
You got us.

678
00:47:33.687 --> 00:47:35.647
No.

679
00:47:35.731 --> 00:47:39.401
We are sticking to our plan,
and going home.

680
00:47:39.484 --> 00:47:41.195
Hold on, you two.

681
00:47:41.278 --> 00:47:45.407
As strange as this sounds,
Grace is actually making sense.

682
00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:47.367
- Thank you.
- You want the money.

683
00:47:47.451 --> 00:47:51.705
I want to get even. The three of us go
and we're sure to get him.

684
00:47:51.747 --> 00:47:53.582
Once you collect the reward,

685
00:47:53.665 --> 00:47:57.669
I'll walk out your front gate
and stay out forever.

686
00:47:57.753 --> 00:47:58.879
Deal?

687
00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:04.218
Your powers of persuasion are uncanny.

688
00:48:04.301 --> 00:48:05.302
Deal.

689
00:48:05.385 --> 00:48:08.764
Bovine bounty hunters.
Now I've seen everything.

690
00:48:08.847 --> 00:48:10.724
Let's get moving, ladies.

691
00:48:10.766 --> 00:48:13.185
Time for an underground smackdown.

692
00:48:15.604 --> 00:48:19.399
Out in the land
Where the heroes meet their makers

693
00:48:19.483 --> 00:48:23.111
Out in the land
Where the hale and hearty fall

694
00:48:23.195 --> 00:48:25.405
Out where the fearless
Get the shudders

695
00:48:25.489 --> 00:48:28.367
Justice is here
And it's wearing udders

696
00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:30.661
The cows are walking tall

697
00:48:30.744 --> 00:48:33.247
Home, this ain't it, pal
Home, home on the range

698
00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:35.415
Home, home
Better go git, pal

699
00:48:35.499 --> 00:48:38.669
Home, home on the range

700
00:48:38.752 --> 00:48:42.714
Okay, boys,
let's go through it one last time.

701
00:48:42.798 --> 00:48:43.799
Who am I?

702
00:48:43.882 --> 00:48:45.217
Uncle Slim?

703
00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:47.219
Correct!

704
00:48:47.302 --> 00:48:50.305
Now, I put on my hat,

705
00:48:50.389 --> 00:48:53.100
then I put on my spectacles.

706
00:48:53.183 --> 00:48:56.019
- Who are you?
- Where's Uncle Slim?

707
00:48:57.229 --> 00:48:59.064
It's still me!

708
00:48:59.106 --> 00:49:02.109
Can't you stupid sack of hammers
get it right?

709
00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:05.529
The ever punctual Mr. Weasely.

710
00:49:06.196 --> 00:49:11.118
Okay, everybody make way for the big man
in black market livestock.

711
00:49:20.669 --> 00:49:22.129
Who are you?

712
00:49:23.172 --> 00:49:26.675
All right, move it, Bessie,
or I'll tan your hides right here.

713
00:49:27.384 --> 00:49:29.511
Watch the suit!

714
00:49:29.595 --> 00:49:31.054
Feast your eyes.

715
00:49:31.138 --> 00:49:35.142
5,000 cows on the barrel head,
as promised.

716
00:49:35.184 --> 00:49:37.186
The name's Wesley.

717
00:49:37.269 --> 00:49:39.313
What do you say we get a move on

718
00:49:39.396 --> 00:49:42.733
and load these cash cows
onto the train A-S-A-P?

719
00:49:42.816 --> 00:49:44.985
- Let's go.
- Yes, of course.

720
00:49:45.068 --> 00:49:47.613
Just as soon as I finish counting.

721
00:49:53.619 --> 00:49:55.704
Lucky Jack, you did it. We're here!

722
00:49:55.787 --> 00:49:58.332
I take my hat off to you.

723
00:49:58.415 --> 00:50:01.835
- You got us here in one piece.
- Seeing is believing.

724
00:50:01.919 --> 00:50:03.962
I don't believe what I see.

725
00:50:04.046 --> 00:50:06.548
- It's Buck!
- Stallion of the Sim-moron.

726
00:50:06.632 --> 00:50:09.176
I'm supposed to be here
in case a horse gets tired.

727
00:50:09.259 --> 00:50:11.136
Cows only.

728
00:50:11.178 --> 00:50:14.014
Look, friend,
you don't understand my situation.

729
00:50:14.097 --> 00:50:17.142
No, you don't understand.

730
00:50:17.184 --> 00:50:19.186
So, I'll say it again.

731
00:50:19.269 --> 00:50:22.689
The only critters
that get by me are cows.

732
00:50:22.773 --> 00:50:25.150
Cows only.

733
00:50:25.192 --> 00:50:28.362
Come on, look. Cut me a break.

734
00:50:28.445 --> 00:50:31.615
Now what?
What are you doing here?

735
00:50:31.698 --> 00:50:34.826
Sorry we're late.
We got separated from the herd.

736
00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:38.455
Right this way, little lady.
Tell 'em Junior sent you.

737
00:50:40.332 --> 00:50:41.458
Howdy, partner.

738
00:50:41.542 --> 00:50:43.085
Nice hat, ma'am.

739
00:50:43.168 --> 00:50:45.087
Cheeky devil.

740
00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:48.215
Excuse me, reject.
Coming through.

741
00:50:49.216 --> 00:50:50.884
Hey, what gives?

742
00:50:50.968 --> 00:50:54.179
- How come they got to go through?
- They're cows.

743
00:50:54.221 --> 00:50:56.181
What? But what about the rabbit?

744
00:50:56.223 --> 00:50:59.101
Obviously, he was with the cows.

745
00:50:59.184 --> 00:51:02.104
I'm with the cows, too.

746
00:51:02.187 --> 00:51:04.565
Hey, cows! Wait up.

747
00:51:04.648 --> 00:51:08.193
Tell this guy you know me.
See, Junior, we're old friends.

748
00:51:08.235 --> 00:51:10.362
Margie! Gretchen!

749
00:51:10.445 --> 00:51:13.240
Miss... hat cow, come on.

750
00:51:13.282 --> 00:51:15.033
It's your old pal, Buck, see?

751
00:51:18.871 --> 00:51:20.581
Doesn't ring a bell.

752
00:51:20.664 --> 00:51:23.250
No, wait. Come back!

753
00:51:23.292 --> 00:51:25.544
Hang on a second.

754
00:51:25.627 --> 00:51:28.255
They're just kidding.
You see, if you could...

755
00:51:29.464 --> 00:51:31.925
Cows!

756
00:51:32.009 --> 00:51:34.011
Don't make me hurt you.

757
00:51:40.267 --> 00:51:44.229
I gotta go, but let's throw
on the old feedbag some time.

758
00:51:44.271 --> 00:51:45.439
Stay cool.

759
00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:47.941
It's hero time.

760
00:51:50.569 --> 00:51:52.779
- What's the plan?
- Let's see.

761
00:51:53.864 --> 00:51:57.784
You two get his attention while I
sneak up and knock him into the cart.

762
00:51:57.868 --> 00:52:00.287
Then we'll rope him up
and wheel him to justice.

763
00:52:00.370 --> 00:52:04.333
For extra measure, how about we conk him
on the noggin with this?

764
00:52:04.416 --> 00:52:06.668
You go, cowgirl,
that's using the old hat.

765
00:52:06.752 --> 00:52:09.046
Now you lost me here, missy.

766
00:52:09.129 --> 00:52:11.256
Look, Jack, it's simple.

767
00:52:11.298 --> 00:52:15.135
Cart, smack, rope, roll, justice.
Come on, Jack, focus.

768
00:52:15.219 --> 00:52:18.472
Now is not the time to get
all scatterbrained and flaky.

769
00:52:24.019 --> 00:52:25.854
Good, I'm not too late.

770
00:52:25.938 --> 00:52:28.440
Sorry. Still staking out your quarry?

771
00:52:28.524 --> 00:52:30.067
Pretty much, why?

772
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:34.071
Listen, I came to warn you,
one equine to another about Rico.

773
00:52:34.154 --> 00:52:37.824
When he nabs that rustler, he'll be
in a big hurry to get that reward.

774
00:52:37.908 --> 00:52:39.409
- So?
- So!

775
00:52:39.493 --> 00:52:42.287
Once he catches his man,
the horse whip comes out.

776
00:52:42.329 --> 00:52:45.332
- He's not shy about using it either.
- Horse whip?

777
00:52:45.374 --> 00:52:48.836
Not only are you gonna be carrying Rico,
but that rustler, too.

778
00:52:48.919 --> 00:52:50.462
Have you seen him? He's huge!

779
00:52:50.546 --> 00:52:52.297
- What should I do?
- Run!

780
00:52:52.339 --> 00:52:54.341
- Okay.
- Run like the wind!

781
00:52:54.383 --> 00:52:57.386
Save yourself.
Go on, take off. Fade!

782
00:52:57.469 --> 00:53:00.097
- Ride into the sunset.
- I'm out of here.

783
00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:02.808
- Scram.
- Thanks, buddy. I owe you one!

784
00:53:02.891 --> 00:53:06.144
God speed, my friend.
So long, sucker.

785
00:53:06.854 --> 00:53:10.357
He must be taking stupid lessons
from that buffalo.

786
00:53:11.733 --> 00:53:14.778
1,420.

787
00:53:14.862 --> 00:53:17.322
1,440.

788
00:53:17.364 --> 00:53:20.450
1,435.

789
00:53:20.534 --> 00:53:24.788
4,336...

790
00:53:25.372 --> 00:53:29.293
- Can't you morons count to yourselves?
- Come on.

791
00:53:29.376 --> 00:53:31.044
Gotta start all over.

792
00:53:31.128 --> 00:53:33.297
- There he is.
- Come on, let's go.

793
00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:36.717
Hold on. You're forgetting
Slim's hypnotic control

794
00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:41.054
over those with less than perfect pitch.
Jack, I hope you can forgive me.

795
00:53:41.138 --> 00:53:42.347
For what, missy?

796
00:53:42.389 --> 00:53:44.391
- For that.
- Watch it, toots.

797
00:53:46.143 --> 00:53:48.687
How practical.

798
00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:51.481
- Done counting.
- What do we got?

799
00:53:51.565 --> 00:53:54.359
4,997.

800
00:53:54.401 --> 00:53:55.986
What? Wait.

801
00:53:56.069 --> 00:53:58.363
I thought you said 5,000, even.

802
00:53:58.405 --> 00:54:01.658
Of course I did.
Gil must've miscounted, that's all.

803
00:54:02.993 --> 00:54:05.412
There's one, up there.

804
00:54:05.454 --> 00:54:07.497
The others can't be far behind.

805
00:54:07.581 --> 00:54:09.374
Just you watch.

806
00:54:09.416 --> 00:54:12.794
You're gonna like this.
Yodeling's an art.

807
00:54:32.814 --> 00:54:34.441
What's the deal, Slimbo?

808
00:54:34.483 --> 00:54:37.027
Maybe she wasn't an art lover.

809
00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:38.403
Philistine!

810
00:54:38.445 --> 00:54:40.656
Shut up, you greenhorns.

811
00:54:40.739 --> 00:54:44.451
Bovine ain't be born
that can resist my charms.

812
00:54:54.545 --> 00:54:56.839
Watch your back, Uncle Slim!

813
00:54:56.922 --> 00:54:58.006
Gotcha.

814
00:54:58.090 --> 00:55:00.801
Where do you think you're going?

815
00:55:04.471 --> 00:55:05.430
- Now, Jack.
- Okay.

816
00:55:05.472 --> 00:55:08.475
What the rootin'-tootin' blazes
is going on here?

817
00:55:13.939 --> 00:55:15.607
Let's get out of here.

818
00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:18.777
Come back here, dog meat.

819
00:55:18.861 --> 00:55:20.487
- Jackpot.
- We got him now.

820
00:55:20.529 --> 00:55:22.489
- Well done.
- Watch out.

821
00:55:22.531 --> 00:55:24.783
It's Buck.

822
00:55:24.867 --> 00:55:26.076
Hey, Casey Jones.

823
00:55:26.159 --> 00:55:28.537
Grab the bills
and fire up the getaway express.

824
00:55:35.169 --> 00:55:37.504
I gave up clown college for this?

825
00:55:40.591 --> 00:55:42.718
It's Slim. I got Slim!

826
00:55:42.801 --> 00:55:44.803
Rico's gonna be so proud of me.

827
00:55:46.263 --> 00:55:47.848
Thank you.

828
00:55:49.057 --> 00:55:50.642
Leave me alone.

829
00:56:01.153 --> 00:56:02.696
Sorry.

830
00:56:03.947 --> 00:56:05.616
Quick, girls. In here.

831
00:56:16.126 --> 00:56:18.253
That was Rico.

832
00:56:20.547 --> 00:56:22.633
What in blue blazes?

833
00:56:28.472 --> 00:56:31.099
I'll knock you into next Tuesday.
Come back here.

834
00:56:32.601 --> 00:56:34.686
- You're going down.
- Junior!

835
00:56:40.526 --> 00:56:42.361
Get this off of me.

836
00:56:45.489 --> 00:56:48.742
Rico's saddle.
I'm wearing Rico's saddle.

837
00:57:00.254 --> 00:57:01.588
Surprise!

838
00:57:27.239 --> 00:57:29.616
We made it, girls.

839
00:57:32.244 --> 00:57:34.037
Ladies, we got company.

840
00:57:41.336 --> 00:57:43.422
Stop. Hit the brakes.

841
00:57:43.505 --> 00:57:44.882
Look out!

842
00:58:02.649 --> 00:58:03.859
Dagnabit.

843
00:58:03.942 --> 00:58:07.654
I guess I gotta do
everything around here myself.

844
00:58:12.326 --> 00:58:16.538
Call me crazy, but I think
these cows got it in for me.

845
00:58:16.622 --> 00:58:18.749
Maybe they just don't like your singing.

846
00:58:18.832 --> 00:58:20.083
Shut up.

847
00:58:20.667 --> 00:58:22.127
Mr. Weasely...

848
00:58:22.211 --> 00:58:24.463
my money, if you please.

849
00:58:25.214 --> 00:58:27.007
I was just keeping it safe for you.

850
00:58:27.090 --> 00:58:28.300
Sure you were.

851
00:58:28.383 --> 00:58:31.762
Protecting my investments
is what I pay this fellow for.

852
00:58:31.845 --> 00:58:36.642
Let me present the most traitorous,
double-crossin' gun for hire

853
00:58:36.683 --> 00:58:39.937
that I've ever had the pleasure
to call partner.

854
00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:43.690
You're too kind, boss.

855
00:58:43.732 --> 00:58:45.651
It can't be.

856
00:58:45.692 --> 00:58:48.612
His reputation as a bounty hunter
is well-known,

857
00:58:48.695 --> 00:58:52.658
but lately he's been doing a little
moonlighting and covering my tracks.

858
00:58:52.699 --> 00:58:56.370
Rico's going to see you to the border,

859
00:58:56.453 --> 00:58:59.164
so that nothing else goes wrong.

860
00:59:01.708 --> 00:59:04.670
Now, if you'll all pardon me,

861
00:59:04.711 --> 00:59:09.007
there's a little Patch of Heaven
on the auction block this morning.

862
00:59:09.091 --> 00:59:12.678
He's going to buy our farm.

863
00:59:12.719 --> 00:59:14.012
Adios!

864
00:59:16.557 --> 00:59:18.767
I don't know how you got here, Skittish,

865
00:59:18.851 --> 00:59:22.396
but stick with me and you may get
to like the other side of the law.

866
00:59:25.232 --> 00:59:29.111
All right, move it, Bessie.
Get in there.

867
00:59:29.152 --> 00:59:32.489
You don't want to be late
for that big roundup in the sky.

868
00:59:40.956 --> 00:59:42.541
Get in there.

869
00:59:42.624 --> 00:59:45.169
Come on, you stupid cows.

870
00:59:48.297 --> 00:59:52.301
Lovely. Now get the engine fired up
and let's make tracks.

871
00:59:55.721 --> 00:59:58.307
Make a break for it, ladies. Run!

872
01:00:01.059 --> 01:00:03.145
Buck, have you gone crazy?

873
01:00:03.187 --> 01:00:05.939
That's entirely possible.

874
01:00:06.023 --> 01:00:10.027
Or maybe I just figured out
who the real heroes are.

875
01:00:10.652 --> 01:00:13.197
Wait, what if this is
some kind of trick?

876
01:00:15.866 --> 01:00:17.492
This isn't a trick.

877
01:00:17.576 --> 01:00:20.078
It's a miracle. Come on!

878
01:00:21.496 --> 01:00:23.957
So, you think you got the drop on me?

879
01:00:24.041 --> 01:00:25.209
Think again!

880
01:00:35.469 --> 01:00:37.179
This is useless.

881
01:00:37.221 --> 01:00:40.349
Let's put our heads together.
More brains, less brawn.

882
01:00:40.432 --> 01:00:42.226
All right.

883
01:00:48.815 --> 01:00:52.110
Okay, Caloway. Fetch.

884
01:01:08.627 --> 01:01:10.254
Lucky shot.

885
01:01:10.838 --> 01:01:13.465
Mother of mercy.
Is this the end of Rico?

886
01:01:18.345 --> 01:01:20.264
Bravo!

887
01:01:20.305 --> 01:01:22.224
You stopped Rico cold.

888
01:01:22.266 --> 01:01:24.560
Shucks, 't'weren't nothing.

889
01:01:24.643 --> 01:01:27.145
Fat lot of good it done us.

890
01:01:27.229 --> 01:01:30.232
Alameda Slim
has already flown the coop.

891
01:01:30.274 --> 01:01:35.153
She's right. Unless we sprout wings
we'll never make it back in time.

892
01:01:35.237 --> 01:01:37.239
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

893
01:01:37.281 --> 01:01:40.200
This train goes right
by Patch of Heaven.

894
01:01:40.284 --> 01:01:42.327
What is in the cud you're chewing?

895
01:01:42.411 --> 01:01:45.247
How are we supposed to drive that thing?

896
01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:46.790
How?

897
01:01:46.874 --> 01:01:48.959
I'll tell you how.

898
01:01:49.042 --> 01:01:52.045
The same way we walked off the farm
into the unknown.

899
01:01:52.129 --> 01:01:55.966
The same way we fought off
those burly barmaids.

900
01:01:56.049 --> 01:01:59.803
And the same way we braved
the Western wilderness

901
01:01:59.887 --> 01:02:03.223
without the benefit of food or water.

902
01:02:03.307 --> 01:02:07.728
We caught Slim once
and we shall do it again.

903
01:02:07.811 --> 01:02:09.396
Who's with me?

904
01:02:11.899 --> 01:02:15.319
Get out of here, you bulls.
Head for the hills.

905
01:02:26.163 --> 01:02:28.290
- Let's get it on.
- Cows rule.

906
01:02:28.332 --> 01:02:30.626
- Howdy, darling.
- Down here.

907
01:02:30.709 --> 01:02:33.045
Look down. Hello, there.

908
01:02:34.546 --> 01:02:36.965
I got two words for you guys.

909
01:02:37.049 --> 01:02:39.301
Cold shower!

910
01:02:39.343 --> 01:02:42.930
We don't have time for this nonsense.
We have a farm to save.

911
01:02:43.013 --> 01:02:45.766
- Maybe we can help you.
- Maybe we can help...

912
01:02:49.186 --> 01:02:51.897
Bye! Come up and see us some time.

913
01:02:52.689 --> 01:02:55.192
CHUGWATER
5 MILES

914
01:03:02.366 --> 01:03:05.827
No! It's the morning express.

915
01:03:05.911 --> 01:03:07.371
There's a switch up ahead.

916
01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:09.998
Way ahead of you, Pops.
Hop on.

917
01:03:10.082 --> 01:03:12.376
- Come on, mule.
- Let's ride.

918
01:03:34.815 --> 01:03:36.650
Road hogs!

919
01:03:39.945 --> 01:03:41.822
See you back at the farm, girls.

920
01:03:41.905 --> 01:03:43.240
Good luck!

921
01:03:43.323 --> 01:03:45.284
This happens all the time.

922
01:03:45.617 --> 01:03:48.370
Sold! All property and livestock

923
01:03:48.412 --> 01:03:51.206
formerly known as Patch of Heaven

924
01:03:51.290 --> 01:03:55.085
is hereby sold to Mr. Yancy O'Del.

925
01:03:55.169 --> 01:03:57.629
Pleasure doing business with you.

926
01:03:59.214 --> 01:04:02.384
O'Del's the name,
foreclosure's the game.

927
01:04:02.426 --> 01:04:05.387
Set yourself over yonder.

928
01:04:05.429 --> 01:04:09.391
Sign this deed,
and the property is all yours.

929
01:04:09.433 --> 01:04:11.351
Much obliged, Sheriff.

930
01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:19.401
There it is!

931
01:04:19.443 --> 01:04:20.736
Home and hearth.

932
01:04:20.819 --> 01:04:24.114
And a holy hallelujah of a curve.

933
01:04:24.198 --> 01:04:26.116
- The brakes.
- No time for that.

934
01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:29.119
- Won't we jump the tracks?
- We're making our own tracks.

935
01:04:29.203 --> 01:04:30.495
This is going to be messy.

936
01:04:38.045 --> 01:04:41.465
The whole territory belongs to me.

937
01:04:42.466 --> 01:04:44.176
Five cents for these chicks.

938
01:04:44.259 --> 01:04:47.221
Come on, now.
Do I hear two cents?

939
01:04:48.472 --> 01:04:51.767
Hold your britches.
One at a time.

940
01:04:52.476 --> 01:04:53.769
Run for your lives!

941
01:04:57.231 --> 01:04:58.273
Watch yourself!

942
01:05:03.487 --> 01:05:07.449
What's the idea,
crashing your train on my property?

943
01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:11.411
It can't be.

944
01:05:25.634 --> 01:05:28.470
Hold it right there.

945
01:05:28.512 --> 01:05:31.557
Piggies, it's time to open up
a can of whup-hide.

946
01:05:32.558 --> 01:05:34.101
Who the...

947
01:05:38.689 --> 01:05:40.482
Get away.

948
01:05:48.907 --> 01:05:52.536
You want to get nuts?
Let's get nuts!

949
01:06:06.425 --> 01:06:08.010
It's Alameda Slim.

950
01:06:08.093 --> 01:06:10.137
You think you've won?

951
01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:13.557
It ain't over till the fat man sings.

952
01:06:28.238 --> 01:06:31.408
Alameda Slim, you're under arrest.

953
01:06:32.659 --> 01:06:35.913
Nobody messes with Pearl's girls.

954
01:06:35.996 --> 01:06:38.207
- Say, girls, got milk?
- Buck!

955
01:06:38.290 --> 01:06:39.541
Just kidding.

956
01:06:40.292 --> 01:06:44.713
Take him away, boys.
Hope you like stripes.

957
01:06:44.796 --> 01:06:48.675
Your cows can't do much
with Slim's reward money.

958
01:06:48.759 --> 01:06:51.553
Think you can find some use for it?

959
01:06:51.595 --> 01:06:53.597
My farm is saved.

960
01:07:02.606 --> 01:07:04.608
Where's Maggie?

961
01:07:13.283 --> 01:07:16.495
I can't believe she just left.

962
01:07:16.578 --> 01:07:18.622
I'm gonna miss her.

963
01:07:18.664 --> 01:07:20.582
So shall I.

964
01:07:20.624 --> 01:07:24.837
Her brash manner, her bullheadedness.
She risked her life for us.

965
01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:27.172
And who are we, but strangers?

966
01:07:27.256 --> 01:07:31.927
We were privileged to know her.
She was a cow like no other.

967
01:07:32.010 --> 01:07:35.931
Right down
to her appalling bodily eruptions.

968
01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.642
That was good.

969
01:07:39.643 --> 01:07:41.603
I was just having one for the road

970
01:07:41.645 --> 01:07:45.649
when I heard all the nice stuff
you guys were saying about me.

971
01:07:45.691 --> 01:07:48.527
Maybe I could hang around awhile.

972
01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:50.571
How about forever?

973
01:07:51.613 --> 01:07:53.615
It's your call, Caloway.

974
01:07:53.657 --> 01:07:56.201
Is this barnyard big enough
for both of us?

975
01:07:56.285 --> 01:07:59.830
Only if you let me wear the hat.

976
01:08:01.665 --> 01:08:04.084
Come on, move your hides, girls!

977
01:08:04.168 --> 01:08:06.670
Last one to the barn
sleeps standing up.

978
01:08:09.173 --> 01:08:11.341
Okay, everyone, big smiles!

979
01:08:12.134 --> 01:08:14.636
"So it was that Alameda Slim,

980
01:08:14.678 --> 01:08:17.346
"most notorious and feared
cattle rustler,

981
01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:21.894
"was apprehended and unmasked
by three unusual dairy cows."

982
01:08:21.977 --> 01:08:25.479
Dagnabit, Jeb. How many times
I gotta tell you to wait your turn?

983
01:08:25.564 --> 01:08:28.734
How many times have I got
to tell you to get out of my barrel?

984
01:08:31.528 --> 01:08:35.282
It's so nice
that Jeb finally found a friend.

985
01:08:35.365 --> 01:08:36.700
Here they come, everybody.

986
01:08:48.212 --> 01:08:50.087
Well done!

987
01:08:50.796 --> 01:08:53.050
Hi, ho, ladies.

988
01:08:53.133 --> 01:08:56.470
Hey, Barry,
three queens, two kings.

989
01:08:56.553 --> 01:08:58.680
Full house.

990
01:08:58.721 --> 01:09:01.975
And the joker is wild.

991
01:09:07.481 --> 01:09:12.569
Darlin', I swear
Once you been there

992
01:09:12.653 --> 01:09:16.698
There ain't a view beneath the blue
That could ever compare

993
01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:21.703
The only thing missing
Is you as my guest

994
01:09:21.745 --> 01:09:26.291
On a little patch of heaven
Way out west

995
01:09:26.375 --> 01:09:28.710
Why don't you come visit

996
01:09:28.752 --> 01:09:33.006
There's room in the nest

997
01:09:33.090 --> 01:09:39.054
On that little patch of heaven
Way out west
