2
00:03:54.458 --> 00:03:58.763
Well, well. What do we got here?

3
00:03:58.897 --> 00:04:03.534
You, uh, runnin' late
for the boneyard, mister?

4
00:04:10.342 --> 00:04:12.143
Yeah, well,

5
00:04:12.277 --> 00:04:14.378
I can see you're a little...

6
00:04:14.511 --> 00:04:16.781
a little filled up here
right now.

7
00:04:16.915 --> 00:04:19.050
I don't think you'd mind me
taking a peek

8
00:04:19.184 --> 00:04:22.254
at the dearly departed,
now, would you?

9
00:04:22.386 --> 00:04:26.423
You see, it could be
some family treasures in there

10
00:04:26.557 --> 00:04:29.194
I'll be interested in.

11
00:04:29.961 --> 00:04:32.731
Now, you just be still,
you goofy old son of a bitch.

12
00:04:41.873 --> 00:04:43.008
Fitch.

13
00:05:34.826 --> 00:05:37.594
You think you can
waltz on in here,

14
00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:40.098
kill all my men? Shut up!

15
00:05:40.231 --> 00:05:41.498
Take my whore?

16
00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:43.467
Chickenshit.

17
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.170
What you gonna do, No Name?

18
00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:48.605
Yeah. A chickenshit, Deuce.
That's what you are.

19
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.607
Let the female go.

20
00:05:50.742 --> 00:05:52.444
Oh, like hell I will.

21
00:05:52.609 --> 00:05:55.680
Like hell I will, motherfucker.

22
00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:59.516
Oh! Fuckin' shot me in my toe!
Fuckin'...

23
00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:05.190
Hmm.

24
00:06:09.995 --> 00:06:11.863
Hi.

25
00:06:11.997 --> 00:06:14.099
I'm gonna get you untied.

26
00:06:14.232 --> 00:06:15.900
I'm gonna untie you.

27
00:06:16.034 --> 00:06:17.534
I'm gonna untie you.

28
00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:18.903
Calm down.

29
00:06:19.037 --> 00:06:21.806
I'm gonna untie you.

30
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.409
Okay? Just let me untie you.

31
00:06:24.541 --> 00:06:27.212
Put you on a horse.

32
00:06:52.137 --> 00:06:53.570
Aw.

33
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.443
That's for leaving me
with the hotel bill in Denver.

34
00:06:58.575 --> 00:06:59.844
That hurt.

35
00:06:59.978 --> 00:07:01.646
But thanks for the help
with that pervert.

36
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.582
I'll be seeing you, No Name.
Come on!

37
00:07:24.536 --> 00:07:28.073
What did they used
to call you down in Mexico?

38
00:07:28.206 --> 00:07:28.907
Slimy.

39
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.875
Slimy. Goddamn.

40
00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:32.977
Slimy Murdock,
they called me.

41
00:07:33.111 --> 00:07:35.346
Can you go back into Mexico?

42
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.349
They won't let me back there,
but I've snuck in a time or two.

43
00:07:38.483 --> 00:07:40.584
Yeah, you better watch out.
They'll hang you.

44
00:07:40.718 --> 00:07:42.353
Whatever happened
to that old gal you dated?

45
00:07:42.487 --> 00:07:43.755
That Dirty Lou you called her.

46
00:07:43.888 --> 00:07:45.523
- Dirty Lou?
- Yeah.

47
00:07:45.657 --> 00:07:47.225
Well, she was a little dirty,

48
00:07:47.358 --> 00:07:50.462
but she wasn't like
that fish lady thing you had.

49
00:07:52.664 --> 00:07:54.432
Yeah, but she was sweet.
I loved her.

50
00:07:54.566 --> 00:07:58.136
Oh, yeah. Looked like a frog
going across a tree.

51
00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:01.372
I wanna know what was the name
of that damn...

52
00:08:01.506 --> 00:08:03.541
- The Union of...
- The Arab Masa.

53
00:08:03.675 --> 00:08:05.710
The Union Trust Bank.

54
00:08:05.844 --> 00:08:07.112
- Well, Angus...
- Yeah.

55
00:08:07.245 --> 00:08:10.315
...what do you think
we got out of this deal?

56
00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:13.918
Well, I know we got
12,000-some odd dollars apiece.

57
00:08:14.052 --> 00:08:15.753
- Now, we, uh...
- Holy shit.

58
00:08:15.887 --> 00:08:18.256
You greasy bastard,
you can't even count.

59
00:08:18.389 --> 00:08:20.225
Uh, bullshit.

60
00:08:20.358 --> 00:08:21.826
Let's play the cards,
for Christ's sake.

61
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.361
Deal those cards, will ya? Here.

62
00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:43.948
Excuse me, gentlemen.

63
00:08:44.082 --> 00:08:46.351
Do you have any water?

64
00:08:50.555 --> 00:08:53.057
Hold it right there, partner.

65
00:08:54.092 --> 00:08:55.994
No need for violence.

66
00:08:56.127 --> 00:08:59.164
I dare say I'm unarmed.

67
00:08:59.297 --> 00:09:01.299
I sell candles.

68
00:09:02.767 --> 00:09:06.371
And all I want
is a drink of water.

69
00:09:14.145 --> 00:09:17.081
You see, I've been traveling
all about selling my wares,

70
00:09:17.215 --> 00:09:19.384
and I'm completely parched.

71
00:09:20.985 --> 00:09:23.154
I would go as far as to say

72
00:09:23.288 --> 00:09:26.858
I will give each of you
a free candle

73
00:09:26.991 --> 00:09:29.127
for a drink of water.

74
00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.095
Go get him some water, Mack.

75
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.208
Thank you.

76
00:09:54.118 --> 00:09:57.889
Now, pick up your shit and
get back to the railroad, boy.

77
00:09:59.324 --> 00:10:00.558
Sure.

78
00:10:00.693 --> 00:10:02.427
No problem.

79
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.329
And thanks again.

80
00:10:06.665 --> 00:10:08.634
Hey, China boy.

81
00:10:08.766 --> 00:10:11.269
Leave the candles with us.

82
00:10:14.539 --> 00:10:16.140
Leave all my candles?

83
00:10:16.274 --> 00:10:19.712
You heard him.
Leave the candles.

84
00:10:48.239 --> 00:10:50.241
Now, why would I do that?

85
00:10:50.375 --> 00:10:52.543
Why?

86
00:10:52.678 --> 00:10:54.178
'Cause if you don't,

87
00:10:54.312 --> 00:10:56.381
I'ma blow a second hole
right in your ass.

88
00:10:58.816 --> 00:11:01.052
- Yeah.
- Second hole.

89
00:11:21.839 --> 00:11:23.975
I see.

90
00:11:24.108 --> 00:11:27.211
You made your point quite clear,
I might add.

91
00:11:44.462 --> 00:11:49.334
Well, it's been nice
making your acquaintance.

92
00:13:04.942 --> 00:13:07.011
Where are they?

93
00:13:13.652 --> 00:13:15.520
They're worth more alive.

94
00:13:18.657 --> 00:13:20.558
True.

95
00:13:20.692 --> 00:13:22.795
Well, when they're alive,

96
00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:24.863
for some reason,

97
00:13:24.996 --> 00:13:26.964
they want revenge.

98
00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:29.467
It's easier to get rid of 'em.

99
00:13:32.003 --> 00:13:34.372
I love peanuts.

100
00:13:34.505 --> 00:13:37.843
Hey, barkeep,
do you have those, uh...

101
00:13:37.975 --> 00:13:39.110
You know,
the ones that are cooked?

102
00:13:39.243 --> 00:13:40.646
- <i>Qué?</i>
- The peanuts.

103
00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:42.748
The new ones.
The cooked peanuts.

104
00:13:42.881 --> 00:13:44.817
They're called roasted peanuts.

105
00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:47.185
Oh, no, Señor Dynamite.

106
00:13:47.318 --> 00:13:49.454
I don't have any of those.

107
00:13:49.587 --> 00:13:52.123
Actually, I've never heard
of those roasted peanuts.

108
00:13:52.256 --> 00:13:53.491
What are those?

109
00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:56.829
- The cooked ones.
- They're roasted peanuts.

110
00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:59.832
- Cooked.
- They're roasted peanuts.

111
00:14:02.033 --> 00:14:03.468
Compadre.

112
00:14:05.938 --> 00:14:07.639
You seen him?

113
00:14:08.774 --> 00:14:10.809
- This guy.
- No. Never in my life.

114
00:14:10.943 --> 00:14:12.276
Listen, mister.

115
00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:15.848
You looking for trouble?
You just found it.

116
00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.316
Okay. Tell me right now.
Where is he?

117
00:14:18.449 --> 00:14:21.452
In the church. It's around
the corner. You can't miss it.

118
00:14:21.586 --> 00:14:24.489
- How many?
- Four or five.

119
00:14:24.622 --> 00:14:26.224
Maybe. I think.

120
00:14:26.357 --> 00:14:27.625
Do you think four?
Do you think five?

121
00:14:27.759 --> 00:14:30.495
Five or four.
<i>Cuatro, cinco.</i>

122
00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:33.297
You're not as stupid
as you look.

123
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.642
Let's go.

124
00:15:25.483 --> 00:15:30.421
I want you to get me
another bottle of whiskey now.

125
00:15:30.555 --> 00:15:33.157
I don't want you
to bring me that piss

126
00:15:33.291 --> 00:15:35.259
that you serve
to the Mexicans.

127
00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:38.129
You understanding me?

128
00:15:38.262 --> 00:15:40.097
Now, if you do,

129
00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:44.569
what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna skin you alive.

130
00:15:44.703 --> 00:15:47.806
Now, get out there
and get me whiskey.

131
00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:50.374
Top-shelf whiskey.

132
00:15:50.508 --> 00:15:51.442
Get!

133
00:16:00.484 --> 00:16:03.287
One game. Just one game.

134
00:16:03.421 --> 00:16:06.858
Will it kill you
to let me win one game?

135
00:16:41.258 --> 00:16:45.329
This is a private party.

136
00:17:10.956 --> 00:17:13.792
Like I said before...

137
00:17:15.761 --> 00:17:18.664
this here is a private party.

138
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.168
Are those roasted peanuts?

139
00:17:25.202 --> 00:17:26.705
May I have one?

140
00:17:47.125 --> 00:17:49.293
They <i>are</i> roasted peanuts.

141
00:17:49.427 --> 00:17:51.730
Holy shit.

142
00:17:58.602 --> 00:18:00.806
A little something.

143
00:18:05.977 --> 00:18:07.846
What the...

144
00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.684
You done ruined my peanuts.

145
00:18:12.818 --> 00:18:14.953
Mm-mmm.

146
00:18:15.087 --> 00:18:17.521
Nothing short of a miracle.

147
00:18:20.726 --> 00:18:22.460
Now...

148
00:18:26.031 --> 00:18:27.699
try one.

149
00:18:35.874 --> 00:18:39.510
Now, those are
some good roasted peanuts.

150
00:18:51.156 --> 00:18:52.858
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.

151
00:18:52.991 --> 00:18:54.893
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm.

152
00:18:56.228 --> 00:18:59.296
You know,
may I have some whiskey?

153
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.700
These, uh...

154
00:19:01.833 --> 00:19:05.569
These peanuts build up
a paste in your mouth.

155
00:19:15.412 --> 00:19:17.015
Ah.

156
00:19:17.149 --> 00:19:19.316
Now, that's some good shit
right there.

157
00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:21.086
Good shit.

158
00:19:21.219 --> 00:19:25.257
Say, uh, what are you playing
over there?

159
00:19:25.389 --> 00:19:26.357
Solitaire.

160
00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:29.628
I heard about that.

161
00:19:29.761 --> 00:19:32.731
But, uh, never had
the chance to play it.

162
00:19:32.864 --> 00:19:36.134
- You any good at it?
- <i>Sí, bueno.</i> He...

163
00:19:36.268 --> 00:19:37.468
No. Nothing.

164
00:19:41.173 --> 00:19:43.942
Ooh, ooh. Too much tequila.
I gotta go pee-pee.

165
00:19:45.811 --> 00:19:48.445
Seems like quite
a difficult game.

166
00:19:48.579 --> 00:19:50.414
How does one play?

167
00:19:50.548 --> 00:19:53.084
Carefully.

168
00:19:53.218 --> 00:19:55.386
Hmm.

169
00:19:57.889 --> 00:19:59.791
Peanuts are fine.

170
00:19:59.925 --> 00:20:02.794
Let's cut to the chase,
shall we?

171
00:20:02.928 --> 00:20:07.331
Why are two gentlemen like you

172
00:20:07.464 --> 00:20:09.267
in my establishment?

173
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.837
Well, I couldn't agree more.

174
00:20:18.109 --> 00:20:20.477
Looking for this guy.

175
00:20:28.119 --> 00:20:30.922
I ain't never seen him.

176
00:20:34.326 --> 00:20:35.894
Help me out!

177
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:07.424
- Four. That was four.
- That was five.

178
00:21:07.558 --> 00:21:09.493
- That was four.
- That was five.

179
00:21:09.628 --> 00:21:12.664
That... One, two, three, four.

180
00:21:12.797 --> 00:21:16.533
One, two, three, four, and five.

181
00:21:18.837 --> 00:21:21.472
Son of a bitch. God...

182
00:21:25.442 --> 00:21:26.878
Five.

183
00:21:28.113 --> 00:21:29.748
- That was six.
- That was five.

184
00:21:29.881 --> 00:21:30.715
Six.

185
00:21:30.849 --> 00:21:32.751
Goddamn it. That was five.

186
00:21:32.884 --> 00:21:35.887
One, two, three, four, five.

187
00:21:36.021 --> 00:21:37.989
Shh.

188
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:54.306
Now, that was six.

189
00:21:54.438 --> 00:21:56.440
That was good.

190
00:21:57.876 --> 00:21:59.576
That was really good.

191
00:21:59.711 --> 00:22:01.313
Now, go get him.

192
00:22:01.445 --> 00:22:03.048
All right.

193
00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.729
All right, let's go, Mexican.

194
00:22:17.862 --> 00:22:20.932
Huh? <i>Gracias.</i>

195
00:22:51.062 --> 00:22:53.865
The horses are back there, sir.

196
00:22:53.999 --> 00:22:55.900
All right, Lieutenant.
What you got?

197
00:22:56.034 --> 00:22:59.871
There's a cabin
about a half mile up that trail.

198
00:23:00.005 --> 00:23:02.807
Sir, I suggest we reconnoiter
the position.

199
00:23:04.175 --> 00:23:05.576
Very well. Carry on.

200
00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:07.412
We'll send someone
down to the cabin,

201
00:23:07.578 --> 00:23:08.680
and then we'll set up.

202
00:23:08.813 --> 00:23:10.048
That sounds good and all,

203
00:23:10.181 --> 00:23:12.150
but if'n he ain't here,
we should just quit.

204
00:23:12.283 --> 00:23:15.086
I'm tired of chasing
this son of a bitch.

205
00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:22.827
We're all tired, Lieutenant.

206
00:23:22.961 --> 00:23:24.528
- Private.
- Yes, sir.

207
00:23:24.662 --> 00:23:27.665
Get your ass on up
to that farmhouse.

208
00:23:40.278 --> 00:23:43.415
Billy Goat Gang.

209
00:23:43.547 --> 00:23:45.683
It said "alive."

210
00:23:46.951 --> 00:23:50.722
I know. I know.
Like I said before...

211
00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:53.224
they like revenge.

212
00:23:54.926 --> 00:23:56.928
I did them a favor,
them old dirty bastards.

213
00:23:57.062 --> 00:24:00.231
We are not getting paid
on this job.

214
00:24:00.365 --> 00:24:02.033
Oh, stop your hollerin' already.

215
00:24:02.167 --> 00:24:05.503
Don't get all mad and your
unmentionables up in a wad.

216
00:24:05.637 --> 00:24:07.539
I'll straighten it out.

217
00:24:07.672 --> 00:24:09.774
Yeah, well,
you'd better see to it.

218
00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:14.145
And since we're gonna be
near a mercantile,

219
00:24:14.279 --> 00:24:16.514
we're gonna have to pick up
some supplies.

220
00:24:16.648 --> 00:24:19.583
The horses are gonna need
to be shod.

221
00:24:20.685 --> 00:24:24.355
By the way,
what are unmentionables?

222
00:24:32.063 --> 00:24:34.466
Don't forget to pick up
some dynamite...

223
00:24:34.598 --> 00:24:35.967
for Dynamite.

224
00:24:36.101 --> 00:24:37.902
Yeah.

225
00:24:38.036 --> 00:24:42.340
So, those old boys fell
for your candlestick trick, hmm?

226
00:24:42.474 --> 00:24:43.975
Yep.

227
00:24:44.109 --> 00:24:48.213
They were a little drunk
and feeble, so that helped.

228
00:24:48.346 --> 00:24:52.484
You know, I don't think they
could see all that well either.

229
00:24:52.616 --> 00:24:54.786
Hmm. Yeah.

230
00:24:54.919 --> 00:24:58.656
They don't listen either.

231
00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:00.358
So the church.

232
00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:04.262
How many sticks did you use?

233
00:25:09.701 --> 00:25:11.870
Ah, fuck.

234
00:25:14.506 --> 00:25:16.407
You gotta be kidding me.

235
00:25:18.943 --> 00:25:20.912
23 sticks in all.

236
00:25:21.045 --> 00:25:23.748
Ah, you wasteful shitbird.

237
00:25:23.882 --> 00:25:25.950
I know.

238
00:25:26.084 --> 00:25:28.286
You know, you could've done
twice as much damage

239
00:25:28.419 --> 00:25:30.455
with half as many.

240
00:25:31.222 --> 00:25:34.192
Probably. But you know
I like to do my job

241
00:25:34.325 --> 00:25:36.027
as thorough as possible.

242
00:25:40.598 --> 00:25:42.133
Ay.

243
00:25:46.471 --> 00:25:47.405
Ah.

244
00:25:47.539 --> 00:25:49.642
Don't mind if I do.

245
00:26:03.221 --> 00:26:07.225
Whew! Oh, my God. Oh, my Lord.
They're chasing me.

246
00:26:07.358 --> 00:26:10.228
They wanna kill me.
Help me, please.

247
00:26:10.361 --> 00:26:12.163
- Who's chasing you?
- Them.

248
00:26:12.297 --> 00:26:14.832
Yes. Them.
But who the hell's them?

249
00:26:16.834 --> 00:26:18.236
Where are you going?

250
00:26:18.369 --> 00:26:20.572
Stop your
stammerin' around, mister.

251
00:26:20.705 --> 00:26:22.340
What's your name?

252
00:26:22.473 --> 00:26:24.108
Help, please.

253
00:26:25.276 --> 00:26:26.511
Name!

254
00:26:26.645 --> 00:26:30.048
I don't know!
I don't want them to find me.

255
00:26:30.515 --> 00:26:32.283
My name's John.

256
00:26:33.351 --> 00:26:34.352
John.

257
00:26:40.391 --> 00:26:41.726
Wait.

258
00:26:41.859 --> 00:26:43.662
Are you with them?

259
00:26:43.795 --> 00:26:46.731
Are you vigilantes? Hired men?

260
00:26:46.864 --> 00:26:47.865
- No.
- No.

261
00:26:47.999 --> 00:26:51.135
Oh! Good. Thank you.

262
00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:53.672
Well, you could
help me possibly.

263
00:26:53.805 --> 00:26:56.207
They're coming for me.
A lot of them.

264
00:27:02.213 --> 00:27:03.214
Oh.

265
00:27:03.348 --> 00:27:05.783
I don't see anyone
at the present moment.

266
00:27:05.917 --> 00:27:07.852
Nobody?

267
00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:13.157
Mister, I suggest you tell us
what's going on.

268
00:27:13.291 --> 00:27:16.761
Please!
They wanna take my life!

269
00:27:16.894 --> 00:27:19.130
I haven't done anything.

270
00:27:19.264 --> 00:27:23.268
I beg you.
I beg you for mercy. Please.

271
00:27:23.401 --> 00:27:25.036
Mercy?

272
00:27:25.169 --> 00:27:27.205
- I don't know.
- I don't like this guy.

273
00:27:27.338 --> 00:27:30.008
Quit your whining.

274
00:27:34.479 --> 00:27:37.415
You can hurt me,
but you will not take my life.

275
00:27:37.548 --> 00:27:39.784
Oh, shut up!

276
00:27:39.917 --> 00:27:42.153
Or we will kill you.

277
00:27:42.287 --> 00:27:45.490
Not one word unless spoken to.
You understand?

278
00:27:48.526 --> 00:27:50.328
Oh, Jesus.

279
00:27:50.461 --> 00:27:54.165
I'm terribly thirsty.
You have anything to drink?

280
00:27:58.503 --> 00:27:59.971
Thank you.

281
00:28:00.104 --> 00:28:02.040
Oh, thank you.

282
00:28:21.426 --> 00:28:23.796
Oh!

283
00:28:25.196 --> 00:28:27.965
Ah, fine. I'll tell you.
I'll tell you.

284
00:28:28.099 --> 00:28:30.234
Naa!

285
00:28:30.368 --> 00:28:32.170
- Didn't I tell him?
- You told him.

286
00:28:32.303 --> 00:28:33.739
- I told him, right?
- You told him.

287
00:28:33.871 --> 00:28:35.273
- You heard me.
- I heard you.

288
00:28:35.406 --> 00:28:38.176
He heard me. How many times
do I gotta tell you?

289
00:28:38.309 --> 00:28:41.647
Not to speak unless spoken to.

290
00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:44.615
The bullshit act
stops here, John.

291
00:28:50.988 --> 00:28:54.225
Until spoken to.

292
00:29:11.142 --> 00:29:12.877
Very well.

293
00:29:14.747 --> 00:29:16.815
I was acting in a play.

294
00:29:16.948 --> 00:29:19.484
I'm an actor, you see.

295
00:29:19.617 --> 00:29:22.755
And a damn good one,
I might add.

296
00:29:23.689 --> 00:29:27.693
Some say maybe the best
in the world, I tell you.

297
00:29:27.826 --> 00:29:29.260
In my last performance,

298
00:29:29.394 --> 00:29:32.865
I went to procure payment
for my services,

299
00:29:32.997 --> 00:29:35.566
where I was pounced upon
by the stagehands

300
00:29:35.701 --> 00:29:37.969
and believe I suffered
a broken leg

301
00:29:38.102 --> 00:29:40.471
due to this misfortune.

302
00:29:40.605 --> 00:29:43.174
The producers
thought I was someone else.

303
00:29:43.307 --> 00:29:45.576
A charlatan of some sort.

304
00:29:47.846 --> 00:29:52.684
Now, if you fine gentlemen
could help me back to my hotel

305
00:29:52.818 --> 00:29:56.187
in secrecy and protect me,

306
00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.223
I would pay you handsomely
for your services.

307
00:29:59.357 --> 00:30:03.127
I have $12,000 waiting
in a safe deposit box

308
00:30:03.261 --> 00:30:05.329
at the Grove Hotel.

309
00:30:09.467 --> 00:30:12.704
Hey, No Name.
Get your ass over here.

310
00:30:17.008 --> 00:30:20.344
Captain, sir, the cabin seems
to be unoccupied at this time.

311
00:30:20.478 --> 00:30:23.014
I bet that slick bastard's
long gone.

312
00:30:23.147 --> 00:30:25.450
Let's get the hell out of here.

313
00:30:33.291 --> 00:30:35.226
John Wilkes Booth.

314
00:30:36.494 --> 00:30:39.597
This is Captain Forbes,
United States Army.

315
00:30:39.731 --> 00:30:41.633
You got five minutes.

316
00:30:41.767 --> 00:30:44.168
Five minutes, Mr. Booth,
on my command.

317
00:30:44.302 --> 00:30:46.003
- You seeing this?
- Yeah.

318
00:30:46.137 --> 00:30:47.673
These men will burn
that structure down

319
00:30:47.806 --> 00:30:49.106
and the ground around you.

320
00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.476
Give me
a quarter stick of dynamite.

321
00:30:54.479 --> 00:30:58.182
All right. Now, listen up.

322
00:30:58.316 --> 00:30:59.952
You're gonna take asshole
on a horse

323
00:31:00.084 --> 00:31:01.586
and get him ready
to go out the back.

324
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.822
I'm gonna lay down a field
of fire here on the front.

325
00:31:03.956 --> 00:31:05.456
Hell of a plan.

326
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.893
Let's go before they know
what hit 'em.

327
00:31:08.025 --> 00:31:09.728
Come on, asshole.

328
00:31:11.329 --> 00:31:14.599
Remember, $12,000
if you keep me safe.

329
00:31:30.883 --> 00:31:32.250
Fire!

330
00:31:38.256 --> 00:31:40.391
Forward, boys!
Let's double quick!

331
00:31:40.525 --> 00:31:42.126
Yes, sir!

332
00:31:47.231 --> 00:31:49.033
That son of a bitch,
he got away,

333
00:31:49.166 --> 00:31:50.802
and he had the help
of two more men!

334
00:31:50.936 --> 00:31:53.404
They skedaddled, Captain!

335
00:31:54.372 --> 00:31:57.074
Son of a bitch.

336
00:33:35.007 --> 00:33:37.241
Damn good beans.

337
00:33:39.911 --> 00:33:41.813
Do you know...

338
00:33:41.947 --> 00:33:44.148
in ancient Egypt...

339
00:33:44.281 --> 00:33:46.652
they would burn
the dead with beans

340
00:33:46.785 --> 00:33:50.154
to ensure their return
to the afterlife?

341
00:33:51.589 --> 00:33:55.994
The beanfield was a place
where the souls of the dead

342
00:33:56.128 --> 00:33:59.798
would await their reincarnation.

343
00:33:59.931 --> 00:34:01.767
True story.

344
00:34:03.267 --> 00:34:05.137
Is that why you like beans?

345
00:34:12.778 --> 00:34:17.749
So, the two men that saved you,

346
00:34:17.883 --> 00:34:19.751
who are they?

347
00:34:24.522 --> 00:34:26.658
I'm not quite sure.

348
00:34:33.799 --> 00:34:36.567
They did not...
They did not come for me.

349
00:34:36.702 --> 00:34:39.638
They came for Mr. Black Jack.

350
00:34:42.741 --> 00:34:46.277
There's my love.
What have you been...

351
00:34:48.046 --> 00:34:49.114
Sergio.

352
00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:53.517
Hilda, not now. No. Go. Not now.

353
00:34:54.418 --> 00:34:56.688
Hilda, run! Get out of here!

354
00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.695
Please.

355
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:05.296
Señor.

356
00:35:05.429 --> 00:35:07.298
Please.

357
00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:16.742
Hilda?

358
00:35:16.875 --> 00:35:18.409
Chair.

359
00:35:20.846 --> 00:35:22.546
Señor Brown.

360
00:35:25.851 --> 00:35:28.687
Señor, please.

361
00:35:36.194 --> 00:35:38.864
No!

362
00:35:42.968 --> 00:35:46.437
Okay. Don't hurt her.
I'll tell you anything.

363
00:35:49.007 --> 00:35:50.876
What they look like?

364
00:35:52.476 --> 00:35:54.278
One gringo. One chino.

365
00:36:44.528 --> 00:36:46.798
You are coming with me.

366
00:36:46.932 --> 00:36:49.067
No. No!

367
00:36:49.201 --> 00:36:50.202
No!

368
00:36:55.439 --> 00:36:57.508
No!

369
00:36:57.642 --> 00:37:00.946
No, <i>mi amore!</i>

370
00:37:01.079 --> 00:37:03.547
No, no!

371
00:37:06.218 --> 00:37:07.551
No!

372
00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.789
Okay, now, where are they?

373
00:38:24.162 --> 00:38:26.631
That smells.

374
00:38:30.467 --> 00:38:32.971
What the hell is this?

375
00:38:33.104 --> 00:38:34.773
Oh!

376
00:38:34.906 --> 00:38:39.210
Um, let me think here. Um...

377
00:38:39.344 --> 00:38:41.578
These guys are them guys.

378
00:38:41.713 --> 00:38:44.082
Sorry, mister.

379
00:38:44.215 --> 00:38:45.516
No can do.

380
00:38:46.952 --> 00:38:52.023
We need an identifiable corpse
for all rewards.

381
00:38:52.157 --> 00:38:54.159
Identifiable.

382
00:38:55.994 --> 00:38:58.997
This looks pretty
goddamn identifiable to me.

383
00:39:00.966 --> 00:39:03.168
The proof is in the bag,
you old geezer.

384
00:39:03.301 --> 00:39:07.806
I'm sorry, sonny,
but I have rules to abide by,

385
00:39:07.939 --> 00:39:13.211
and no body means no reward.

386
00:39:13.345 --> 00:39:15.013
No reward?

387
00:39:16.815 --> 00:39:18.683
I told you, mister,

388
00:39:18.817 --> 00:39:21.686
the identifiable parts
is right here.

389
00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:24.189
These guys are them guys!

390
00:39:24.322 --> 00:39:27.524
You get outta here right now,
yellow boy...

391
00:39:27.659 --> 00:39:29.761
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Take it easy, old bastard.

392
00:39:29.894 --> 00:39:32.764
...before I fill your ass
full of lead.

393
00:39:32.897 --> 00:39:34.866
I'm finding the door.
I'm walking.

394
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.500
- Get out!
- I'm walking.

395
00:39:36.634 --> 00:39:37.869
Go on. Get out.

396
00:39:38.003 --> 00:39:39.404
You goofy round-eye,
old wrinkled bastard.

397
00:39:39.536 --> 00:39:41.006
Get out now!

398
00:42:39.652 --> 00:42:42.655
You mother...

399
00:42:46.691 --> 00:42:48.793
You get the reward?

400
00:42:58.303 --> 00:43:00.605
No payout.

401
00:43:00.738 --> 00:43:03.975
No. No payout.

402
00:43:04.108 --> 00:43:07.245
And for that shitbird,
Black Jack?

403
00:43:07.378 --> 00:43:09.180
Nothing.

404
00:43:09.314 --> 00:43:11.349
Not even a dime for that turd

405
00:43:11.482 --> 00:43:14.085
or the remnants
of the Billy Goat Gang.

406
00:43:14.219 --> 00:43:17.288
Barkeep, I need a drink.
I need it bad.

407
00:43:21.359 --> 00:43:23.094
Can you act?

408
00:43:24.596 --> 00:43:25.730
No.

409
00:43:27.065 --> 00:43:29.000
Do you know what acting is?

410
00:43:29.133 --> 00:43:31.069
I've been to a play once.

411
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:33.639
Mister, you're okay?

412
00:43:33.771 --> 00:43:36.709
No, I am not okay.
I'm in dire need for an actor

413
00:43:36.841 --> 00:43:39.210
to play the lead
in my play tonight.

414
00:43:39.344 --> 00:43:41.012
Hey, mister.

415
00:43:42.547 --> 00:43:43.381
You need an actor?

416
00:43:43.514 --> 00:43:45.216
Yes. But it can't be you.

417
00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:47.919
You're too... You're, uh, too...

418
00:43:48.052 --> 00:43:51.222
You're, um... I'm sorry.
You're not the right type.

419
00:44:00.298 --> 00:44:01.734
Hello.

420
00:44:01.866 --> 00:44:04.469
I'm not an actor,
but I know one.

421
00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:09.474
Hey, John.

422
00:44:11.009 --> 00:44:12.310
Good afternoon.

423
00:44:12.443 --> 00:44:14.912
This man here
is looking for an actor.

424
00:44:15.913 --> 00:44:17.181
I'm not an actor.

425
00:44:17.315 --> 00:44:20.418
What do you mean
you're not an actor?

426
00:44:20.551 --> 00:44:22.153
You're one of the best
damn actors there is.

427
00:44:22.287 --> 00:44:24.657
You even said so yourself.

428
00:44:24.789 --> 00:44:28.993
He also did this play
called "The American Assassin."

429
00:44:29.127 --> 00:44:31.396
"An American Assassin"?

430
00:44:34.499 --> 00:44:36.601
You can act.

431
00:44:36.735 --> 00:44:38.469
You have saved me, my good man,

432
00:44:38.603 --> 00:44:41.005
and I need you to act
in my play tonight.

433
00:44:41.139 --> 00:44:42.373
Here's the script.

434
00:44:42.507 --> 00:44:44.175
We must get you
to the theater immediately.

435
00:44:44.309 --> 00:44:45.910
I can't believe
this is happening!

436
00:44:46.044 --> 00:44:48.146
Barkeep, a bottle on me
for those two.

437
00:44:48.279 --> 00:44:50.148
And I would love you
to be my guests tonight.

438
00:44:50.281 --> 00:44:53.117
Two reserved seats
on the house.

439
00:44:53.251 --> 00:44:54.319
You.

440
00:44:54.452 --> 00:44:56.087
- Thank you, mister.
- You're gonna be great.

441
00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:57.656
And good luck tonight!

442
00:44:57.790 --> 00:44:59.257
What do you
expect from me?

443
00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:01.559
You look perfect
for this part.

444
00:45:12.337 --> 00:45:15.473
I would like bottle
and some glasses.

445
00:45:15.606 --> 00:45:16.541
Four glasses.

446
00:45:16.675 --> 00:45:18.443
Anything for you, Taviano.

447
00:45:18.576 --> 00:45:20.178
You gonna do a show
for us tonight?

448
00:45:20.311 --> 00:45:22.880
No. No show.
I'm just passing through.

449
00:45:23.014 --> 00:45:24.315
No show tonight.

450
00:45:24.449 --> 00:45:25.550
Okay.

451
00:45:25.684 --> 00:45:28.419
Excuse me. Are you an actor?

452
00:45:29.887 --> 00:45:31.456
No. I'm magician.

453
00:45:31.589 --> 00:45:33.257
Magician?

454
00:45:34.592 --> 00:45:37.929
Hear that, No Name?
He's a magician.

455
00:45:39.597 --> 00:45:41.966
I got an idea.

456
00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:44.402
Mr. Magician.

457
00:45:47.105 --> 00:45:49.607
Can you make
this peanut disappear?

458
00:46:04.088 --> 00:46:06.792
Goddamn! You see that, No Name?

459
00:46:06.924 --> 00:46:08.493
He made the peanut disappear.

460
00:46:08.626 --> 00:46:10.094
It was in his left hand,
moved it around,

461
00:46:10.228 --> 00:46:11.996
and then he went back
to his left hand,

462
00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:13.965
and it came out his mouth.

463
00:46:20.371 --> 00:46:22.373
Okay, ladies, let's go.

464
00:46:22.507 --> 00:46:25.042
Come see our show!
One night only!

465
00:46:25.176 --> 00:46:26.879
Get 'em going.

466
00:46:27.011 --> 00:46:29.280
Two bits. Come on in. Two bits.

467
00:46:29.414 --> 00:46:31.582
Come on in for a good time.

468
00:46:31.717 --> 00:46:34.686
Special on Tarheels.

469
00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:36.421
Yeah!

470
00:46:36.554 --> 00:46:39.758
Come on in, boys,
and get your vodka!

471
00:47:22.668 --> 00:47:23.902
Thank you.

472
00:47:24.035 --> 00:47:25.871
I would like
to present to you tonight

473
00:47:26.003 --> 00:47:28.473
a tale of treachery and deceit.

474
00:47:28.606 --> 00:47:32.109
Of course we have
to add a splash of levity

475
00:47:32.243 --> 00:47:33.712
along the way as well.

476
00:47:33.846 --> 00:47:37.215
I now ask you to sit back

477
00:47:37.348 --> 00:47:41.118
and enjoy
"A Light Through the Darkness."

478
00:47:41.252 --> 00:47:42.320
Whoo!

479
00:47:47.793 --> 00:47:49.928
Think I'm gonna go get us
some whiskey.

480
00:47:50.061 --> 00:47:53.765
See if they have those peanuts.
Them roasted ones.

481
00:47:53.899 --> 00:47:57.401
Hey, keep it down over there.
Show some respect.

482
00:47:57.535 --> 00:47:59.403
Shut up.

483
00:48:03.074 --> 00:48:05.677
Whoo!

484
00:48:08.546 --> 00:48:12.283
I told you time and again,
Emma Sue,

485
00:48:12.416 --> 00:48:17.421
I wouldn't waste my time
on such rubbish as Charles.

486
00:48:17.555 --> 00:48:19.624
Oh!

487
00:48:21.025 --> 00:48:24.863
That's what you get for lying,
you heated Jezebel!

488
00:48:24.997 --> 00:48:27.365
Oh!

489
00:48:27.498 --> 00:48:32.303
Oh, the whore!

490
00:48:32.436 --> 00:48:36.541
How could my most
cherished friend hurt me so?

491
00:48:36.675 --> 00:48:38.810
I should've known
this would happen.

492
00:48:38.944 --> 00:48:41.813
Even when we were children,
she was the jealous type.

493
00:48:41.947 --> 00:48:46.685
I can't help that such a dashing
young man is in love with me.

494
00:48:52.824 --> 00:48:54.525
Oh, no!

495
00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:57.161
You wicked double-minded wench.

496
00:48:57.295 --> 00:49:00.197
You're nothing
but a low-life...

497
00:49:00.331 --> 00:49:02.466
Oh! Oh!

498
00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:04.670
Get her! Get her!

499
00:49:04.803 --> 00:49:07.639
- Get her!
- Get her. That's it.

500
00:49:13.177 --> 00:49:15.580
There you go.

501
00:49:43.574 --> 00:49:47.679
Now what are you gonna do?

502
00:49:47.813 --> 00:49:49.213
Who is it?

503
00:49:49.347 --> 00:49:51.083
It is I, my love.

504
00:49:51.248 --> 00:49:52.951
Please don't keep
a fella waiting,

505
00:49:53.085 --> 00:49:55.453
for I've long to see you,
my sweet.

506
00:50:00.591 --> 00:50:02.159
Is everything okay, dearest?

507
00:50:02.293 --> 00:50:04.562
Think, Emma Sue. Think.

508
00:50:24.548 --> 00:50:26.217
Come in.

509
00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:31.389
Emma Sue!

510
00:50:31.522 --> 00:50:34.660
You are most irresistible,
darling.

511
00:50:34.793 --> 00:50:37.863
I cannot tell you
how long I've waited for you.

512
00:50:37.996 --> 00:50:39.965
Mwah.

513
00:50:40.098 --> 00:50:45.070
Charles, my love, I want this.
I need this.

514
00:50:45.202 --> 00:50:47.405
But can I spare your patience

515
00:50:47.538 --> 00:50:50.976
to play along with me
in a game of intimacy?

516
00:50:56.347 --> 00:50:58.449
What? What, my sweet?

517
00:50:58.582 --> 00:51:00.618
No need to tarry.
I've got what you need.

518
00:51:02.453 --> 00:51:04.790
Oh!

519
00:51:04.923 --> 00:51:06.792
Now, put this on,

520
00:51:06.925 --> 00:51:10.194
and I'll take you outside for
the ride of your life, darling.

521
00:51:12.931 --> 00:51:15.232
Then tally-ho, shall we?

522
00:51:15.366 --> 00:51:17.234
This is so entertaining,
dearest.

523
00:51:17.368 --> 00:51:20.571
What in tarnation was that?

524
00:51:20.706 --> 00:51:23.041
Oh. What, darling?
I didn't hear anything.

525
00:51:23.175 --> 00:51:25.309
That.

526
00:51:25.443 --> 00:51:28.680
Don't tell me
you didn't hear that.

527
00:51:28.814 --> 00:51:30.882
What the hell is that?
Who is it?

528
00:51:31.016 --> 00:51:33.085
Oh.

529
00:51:33.217 --> 00:51:34.953
Darling, I can explain.

530
00:51:35.087 --> 00:51:37.621
I can explain it to you outside
with a breath of fresh air.

531
00:51:37.756 --> 00:51:39.057
Come on.

532
00:51:39.191 --> 00:51:40.892
Oh!

533
00:51:43.028 --> 00:51:44.930
Mirabel?

534
00:51:45.063 --> 00:51:47.132
What the devil is going on here?

535
00:51:47.264 --> 00:51:48.934
I think I should take my leave.

536
00:51:51.103 --> 00:51:52.871
Oh, Charles, my love.

537
00:51:53.004 --> 00:51:55.707
I don't know
how she could've gotten here.

538
00:51:55.841 --> 00:51:57.575
I haven't
the slightest idea why.

539
00:51:57.709 --> 00:52:00.846
Why did you try and kill me,
Emma Sue?

540
00:52:00.979 --> 00:52:03.514
I never did anything
to hurt you.

541
00:52:03.648 --> 00:52:07.018
I thought we were friends,
Emma Sue.

542
00:52:07.152 --> 00:52:10.588
Aw!

543
00:52:10.722 --> 00:52:13.457
I must be taking
my leave now.

544
00:52:13.591 --> 00:52:15.827
How can one person
be so callous?

545
00:52:15.961 --> 00:52:18.864
Charles!

546
00:52:18.997 --> 00:52:21.967
You can't leave me.

547
00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:23.101
Never.

548
00:52:23.235 --> 00:52:24.903
- Emma Sue.
- Charles.

549
00:52:26.104 --> 00:52:27.105
- Look at me.
- Whoa.

550
00:52:28.974 --> 00:52:30.675
Oh!

551
00:53:00.304 --> 00:53:01.338
Yeah.

552
00:53:01.472 --> 00:53:03.407
Thank you all for coming!

553
00:53:03.541 --> 00:53:05.710
That was pretty nice.

554
00:53:05.844 --> 00:53:07.913
- Them girls were good, man.
- Yeah, they were.

555
00:53:08.046 --> 00:53:09.748
I sure enjoyed that.

556
00:53:09.881 --> 00:53:12.250
That's probably the best
two bits I've ever spent.

557
00:53:12.383 --> 00:53:16.353
Two bits? You think two bits
can get us one of them girls?

558
00:53:16.487 --> 00:53:18.622
Maybe $2.

559
00:53:18.757 --> 00:53:21.960
Oh, my God!
It's the guy from the play!

560
00:53:22.093 --> 00:53:23.728
I-I just saw him.

561
00:53:23.862 --> 00:53:26.932
He-He rode off on a horse.
He went that way.

562
00:53:27.065 --> 00:53:29.533
Oh, my God!
He killed the president!

563
00:53:29.668 --> 00:53:31.502
The president's dead?

564
00:53:31.636 --> 00:53:34.039
Oh, my God!
The president's dead!

565
00:53:35.907 --> 00:53:37.508
Huh.

566
00:53:37.642 --> 00:53:40.245
War Department in Washington.

567
00:53:40.377 --> 00:53:41.880
What the hell.

568
00:53:42.013 --> 00:53:46.117
"Murderer of our late beloved
president, Abraham Lincoln.

569
00:53:46.251 --> 00:53:48.619
John Wilkes Booth."

570
00:53:48.753 --> 00:53:50.487
Look at that. Shit.

571
00:53:51.488 --> 00:53:53.058
Shit.

572
00:53:53.191 --> 00:53:54.391
Shit!

573
00:53:54.525 --> 00:53:55.927
Shit!

574
00:54:00.497 --> 00:54:02.000
Let's go get him.

575
00:54:02.133 --> 00:54:04.002
Goddamn it.

576
00:55:00.258 --> 00:55:04.195
I just never would've figured
him for a murderer, No Name.

577
00:55:04.329 --> 00:55:06.131
He's such a good actor.

578
00:55:06.264 --> 00:55:09.100
But the president, no less?

579
00:55:09.234 --> 00:55:11.970
That's pretty cool,
come to think of it.

580
00:55:13.338 --> 00:55:15.640
Well, good actor or not,

581
00:55:15.774 --> 00:55:18.743
he's worth $50,000, partner.

582
00:55:20.312 --> 00:55:25.250
And this time, let's try alive,
not dead.

583
00:55:25.383 --> 00:55:29.120
I suppose you're right.

584
00:55:29.254 --> 00:55:30.355
Just never know

585
00:55:30.487 --> 00:55:33.725
when evil lurks
in the hearts of men sometimes.

586
00:55:33.858 --> 00:55:36.928
A real bona fide assassin.

587
00:55:37.062 --> 00:55:39.698
Don't get riled up
over his fame.

588
00:55:39.831 --> 00:55:42.167
He's just
a bloodthirsty assassin.

589
00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:44.535
Nothing more, nothing less.

590
00:55:47.372 --> 00:55:48.907
You're right.

591
00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:52.877
I guess I just got all caught up
in all the fun of it all.

592
00:55:54.846 --> 00:55:58.183
Come to think of it,
you did, too.

593
00:55:58.316 --> 00:56:01.286
What was her name anyways?
I never got to meet her.

594
00:56:01.419 --> 00:56:04.356
Dynamite, let's try to focus up,
all right? Just let it go.

595
00:56:04.488 --> 00:56:05.357
Focus up here.

596
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:15.000
Just be quiet. Shut up.

597
00:56:23.208 --> 00:56:25.844
It was pretty funny.
Those two gals got after it

598
00:56:25.977 --> 00:56:28.680
like a couple of polecats.

599
00:56:28.813 --> 00:56:30.248
Oh, shit.

600
00:56:30.382 --> 00:56:32.384
And then when John died.

601
00:56:32.516 --> 00:56:34.452
When he got shot and stuff.

602
00:56:34.585 --> 00:56:36.488
He got shot.
He was like... aaaah!

603
00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:39.057
That was pretty
fucking hilarious.

604
00:56:41.226 --> 00:56:44.362
I told you, man,
that was... that was some shit.

605
00:56:44.496 --> 00:56:47.598
That was some shit.

606
00:56:48.666 --> 00:56:50.301
Evenin', gentlemen.

607
00:56:57.842 --> 00:56:59.644
Now, take those guns out.

608
00:56:59.778 --> 00:57:01.880
Slowly.

609
00:57:02.013 --> 00:57:05.183
And drop them on the ground
near me.

610
00:57:08.053 --> 00:57:09.620
Like this?

611
00:57:11.756 --> 00:57:16.127
Now, Black Jack Bennet
was my partner.

612
00:57:16.261 --> 00:57:18.696
Upon his demise,

613
00:57:18.830 --> 00:57:20.698
it's all mine.

614
00:57:20.832 --> 00:57:22.434
Now, where's the gold?

615
00:57:22.566 --> 00:57:24.836
Gold.

616
00:57:24.969 --> 00:57:28.773
Don't play me for a fool.
Where's the gold?

617
00:57:28.907 --> 00:57:31.709
We ain't after the gold,
just the bounty.

618
00:57:31.843 --> 00:57:34.212
After a wanted man,
in case you didn't know.

619
00:57:34.345 --> 00:57:37.515
Don't lie to me, boy.

620
00:57:37.649 --> 00:57:42.387
Listen. We're bounty hunters,
and that's what we do.

621
00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:45.023
I'd appreciate if you wouldn't
call my friend here a liar.

622
00:57:45.156 --> 00:57:46.858
You'll appreciate it, do you?

623
00:57:49.427 --> 00:57:53.631
Well, you boys got a line
of shit, I will give you that.

624
00:57:53.765 --> 00:57:55.667
More importantly,

625
00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:58.837
you have a nice payout
down in the cabin,

626
00:57:58.970 --> 00:58:02.974
and I think
that might be mighty profitable

627
00:58:03.108 --> 00:58:05.243
now that you've come
to mention it.

628
00:58:05.376 --> 00:58:07.078
Yeah, maybe so.

629
00:58:07.212 --> 00:58:09.948
Yeah, that is so.

630
00:58:10.081 --> 00:58:12.250
Bigger than your penny-ass,
nickle dime shit

631
00:58:12.383 --> 00:58:13.818
you would've got
from Black Jack, mister.

632
00:58:13.952 --> 00:58:15.086
Dynamite, knock it off.

633
00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:16.754
You damn right
there's a hostage,

634
00:58:16.888 --> 00:58:18.223
and a big amount of payout

635
00:58:18.356 --> 00:58:20.258
is due upon the delivery
of that bounty.

636
00:58:20.391 --> 00:58:23.094
Hey, Dynamite, knock it off.
Pipe down.

637
00:58:23.228 --> 00:58:24.929
All right.

638
00:58:27.398 --> 00:58:28.800
He's right.

639
00:58:28.933 --> 00:58:31.970
Big payout.

640
00:58:32.103 --> 00:58:33.671
Okay.

641
00:58:33.805 --> 00:58:36.674
You. Pick up your gun.

642
00:58:40.078 --> 00:58:41.346
Easy.

643
00:58:46.784 --> 00:58:49.420
Now, go down to the cabin.

644
00:58:50.922 --> 00:58:53.625
Bring back that hostage.

645
00:58:53.758 --> 00:58:55.560
One false move,

646
00:58:55.693 --> 00:58:58.897
and your partner here is dead.

647
00:58:59.998 --> 00:59:03.368
Now, get going. Now, hurry up.

648
00:59:03.501 --> 00:59:05.436
No Name?

649
00:59:05.570 --> 00:59:07.772
Yeah. Just make it quick.

650
00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:17.982
Let me go.

651
00:59:18.116 --> 00:59:21.886
Can't you see I'm bleeding
to dea... Oh, no, no, no, no!

652
00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:24.155
I told you to stop whining.

653
00:59:24.289 --> 00:59:27.492
Oh! Oh!

654
00:59:28.259 --> 00:59:31.529
It's nice to finally get
some peace and quiet here.

655
00:59:31.664 --> 00:59:35.767
Oh. That there is my knife,

656
00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:37.702
and I'll be taking it back, Ed.

657
00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:42.207
Oh! I bet that felt good.

658
00:59:43.308 --> 00:59:44.609
Come again?

659
00:59:44.742 --> 00:59:47.212
I didn't quite hear you.

660
00:59:48.246 --> 00:59:52.250
Oh. You want some more wine.

661
00:59:54.085 --> 00:59:57.789
Well, here you go.

662
00:59:57.922 --> 01:00:00.325
You sure deserved it.

663
01:00:00.458 --> 01:00:01.694
Besides,

664
01:00:01.826 --> 01:00:04.262
you look kinda pale and all.

665
01:00:04.395 --> 01:00:07.865
That wine there is gonna
make you feel alive again.

666
01:00:07.999 --> 01:00:10.435
Mm.

667
01:00:10.568 --> 01:00:13.504
Can you believe...

668
01:00:13.639 --> 01:00:15.540
that kid...

669
01:00:15.674 --> 01:00:20.311
killed the president
of the United States?

670
01:00:29.655 --> 01:00:31.122
Ouch.

671
01:00:32.658 --> 01:00:34.425
Oh, this hurts.

672
01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:37.895
This hurts.

673
01:00:40.198 --> 01:00:41.933
Uh-oh.

674
01:00:42.066 --> 01:00:44.802
I think I have a broken nose.

675
01:00:46.504 --> 01:00:49.140
You better let me go.

676
01:00:49.274 --> 01:00:51.710
They're coming to rescue me.

677
01:00:51.843 --> 01:00:53.411
Who?

678
01:00:53.544 --> 01:00:56.749
Ain't no one's
gonna find you here.

679
01:00:56.881 --> 01:00:59.652
Like no one found
these guys I killed

680
01:00:59.784 --> 01:01:01.919
over two years ago.

681
01:01:02.053 --> 01:01:03.988
Goddamn it.

682
01:01:07.125 --> 01:01:09.927
So, with that being said,

683
01:01:10.061 --> 01:01:13.197
I don't think
I can do that, mister.

684
01:01:13.331 --> 01:01:16.567
At least till I collect
that reward for you...

685
01:01:16.702 --> 01:01:17.802
for killing the president.

686
01:01:17.935 --> 01:01:19.971
Please.

687
01:01:20.104 --> 01:01:22.473
That president had it coming.

688
01:01:24.242 --> 01:01:26.511
You need to listen to me.

689
01:01:26.645 --> 01:01:29.113
I'm not the man they say I am.

690
01:01:30.515 --> 01:01:34.052
I did justice,
and you all should be grateful.

691
01:01:34.185 --> 01:01:37.322
My face!

692
01:01:37.455 --> 01:01:38.856
All right!

693
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:40.858
That tears it.

694
01:01:40.992 --> 01:01:43.662
There's something
stuck in my face.

695
01:01:44.429 --> 01:01:47.298
I've had enough of this shit.

696
01:01:51.436 --> 01:01:53.304
Huh.

697
01:01:54.673 --> 01:01:55.840
There.

698
01:01:55.973 --> 01:01:58.309
That's more like it.

699
01:01:59.444 --> 01:02:00.679
Bop.

700
01:02:00.813 --> 01:02:04.783
Go on. You can cry now,
you needy little bitch.

701
01:02:04.916 --> 01:02:06.184
- Woof!
- Oh!

702
01:02:06.317 --> 01:02:09.722
And quit your bleedin'
all over the floor.

703
01:02:09.854 --> 01:02:11.622
Be nice.

704
01:02:11.757 --> 01:02:13.925
There are guests here.

705
01:02:17.595 --> 01:02:19.397
Shh.

706
01:02:29.207 --> 01:02:31.442
You stay right here.

707
01:02:38.116 --> 01:02:40.451
You best hold up right there.

708
01:02:42.019 --> 01:02:45.022
One more move...

709
01:02:45.156 --> 01:02:47.458
and I'm gonna shoot.

710
01:02:51.864 --> 01:02:53.297
Shh.

711
01:02:54.899 --> 01:02:58.771
Oh. John. Holy shit.

712
01:02:58.903 --> 01:03:01.606
You're shot. You okay?

713
01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:04.409
What the hell happened? Huh?

714
01:03:04.542 --> 01:03:05.711
Here.

715
01:03:05.844 --> 01:03:07.478
I'm okay.

716
01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:10.348
Hey, we gotta stop
the bleeding.

717
01:03:10.481 --> 01:03:13.017
Goddamn it. Put this on.
Put your hand right there.

718
01:03:13.151 --> 01:03:15.052
Now, hold tight. Good.

719
01:03:15.186 --> 01:03:16.822
Put pressure right there.

720
01:03:16.954 --> 01:03:19.090
What the hell happened, John?

721
01:03:22.828 --> 01:03:24.195
What in the hell is this?

722
01:03:24.328 --> 01:03:26.564
What the hell you want?

723
01:03:29.066 --> 01:03:31.035
This here
is my friend John here.

724
01:03:32.036 --> 01:03:32.937
You shot him?

725
01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:34.972
This rotten son of a bitch?

726
01:03:35.106 --> 01:03:36.875
Well, I didn't shoot him.

727
01:03:37.008 --> 01:03:39.043
He was already bleedin' out

728
01:03:39.177 --> 01:03:41.647
when I grabbed him
outside the theater.

729
01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:44.048
And I think
he'll be staying right here.

730
01:03:46.551 --> 01:03:49.855
Well, looks like
we're in a little fix, lady.

731
01:03:49.987 --> 01:03:53.024
You see, you got someone I need,

732
01:03:53.157 --> 01:03:55.026
and I ain't
letting him die on me.

733
01:03:55.159 --> 01:03:56.627
What the hell
are you waiting for?

734
01:03:56.762 --> 01:03:59.397
- Shoot the crazy witch.
- Shut the hell up, John.

735
01:03:59.530 --> 01:04:01.299
Not another word.

736
01:04:03.267 --> 01:04:05.570
You better listen, John,

737
01:04:05.704 --> 01:04:08.039
and shut your piehole.

738
01:04:10.174 --> 01:04:14.278
Well, what's it gonna be?

739
01:04:14.412 --> 01:04:17.348
I ain't accustomed to shooting
a woman, but I will.

740
01:04:18.684 --> 01:04:20.251
Well, well, well.

741
01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:25.490
A chivalrous gentlemen, I see.

742
01:04:27.893 --> 01:04:30.495
Well, I tell you what.

743
01:04:35.634 --> 01:04:39.504
Why don't you get No Name
to shoot this bitch?

744
01:04:39.638 --> 01:04:43.441
How the hell you know
a man called No Name?

745
01:04:46.244 --> 01:04:48.045
That's my partner.

746
01:04:48.179 --> 01:04:50.682
We're what you call...

747
01:04:52.416 --> 01:04:54.519
business associates.

748
01:04:58.623 --> 01:05:02.059
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch,
if that don't beat all.

749
01:05:02.193 --> 01:05:04.529
He saved my hide a time or two.

750
01:05:04.663 --> 01:05:06.732
You know what?

751
01:05:06.865 --> 01:05:08.132
Let me tell you...

752
01:05:08.266 --> 01:05:10.702
Let me tell you the time
he really saved my ass.

753
01:05:10.836 --> 01:05:14.940
No shit. Goddamn,
it's a small world, ain't it?

754
01:05:15.072 --> 01:05:17.074
It's really nice to meet you.

755
01:05:17.208 --> 01:05:19.176
Hey, I'm dying over here.

756
01:05:19.310 --> 01:05:21.178
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

757
01:05:25.483 --> 01:05:28.787
I wonder what's taking
your buddy so long.

758
01:05:30.621 --> 01:05:32.223
Well, he'll be back directly.

759
01:05:32.356 --> 01:05:35.393
I wouldn't worry
so much about it.

760
01:05:35.526 --> 01:05:39.597
I hate to think that he
was trying to pull a fast one.

761
01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:45.536
Hey, Hoodoo!
How's my partner doing?

762
01:05:45.671 --> 01:05:48.472
Your partner
is doing just fine.

763
01:05:48.606 --> 01:05:52.678
Howdy, sweetheart.
It's been a long time.

764
01:06:01.954 --> 01:06:03.487
You good with that Hawkens?

765
01:06:03.621 --> 01:06:06.858
Well, I'm just fine,
Mr. Dynamite?

766
01:06:06.992 --> 01:06:08.526
I use this rifle

767
01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:12.396
in one of those newfangled
traveling Wild West shows.

768
01:06:12.530 --> 01:06:15.734
I can hit a gnat
off a dog's ass.

769
01:06:15.867 --> 01:06:17.301
At 300 yards.

770
01:06:19.638 --> 01:06:21.205
Damn.

771
01:06:24.241 --> 01:06:25.777
Hey!

772
01:06:25.911 --> 01:06:29.881
Just to be sure,
I can't see my friend from here!

773
01:06:30.015 --> 01:06:32.516
Walk him out in the open
if you would, please!

774
01:06:37.723 --> 01:06:39.256
Come on.

775
01:06:42.861 --> 01:06:45.463
There's your sweetheart.

776
01:06:45.596 --> 01:06:48.734
Now, just get your ass up here.

777
01:07:00.879 --> 01:07:01.880
Now!

778
01:07:22.834 --> 01:07:26.038
Pearl. Well, I never thought
I'd say this,

779
01:07:26.170 --> 01:07:28.439
but it's good seeing you.

780
01:07:28.572 --> 01:07:29.908
Hmm.

781
01:07:30.042 --> 01:07:31.542
Well...

782
01:07:33.511 --> 01:07:35.881
it's good to see you, too,
darlin'.

783
01:07:39.283 --> 01:07:41.119
Got pretty wooly
with your friend there

784
01:07:41.252 --> 01:07:43.055
for a minute or two.

785
01:07:43.187 --> 01:07:46.992
You never told me you're running
with a business partner.

786
01:07:47.125 --> 01:07:50.662
Well, for you,
he's not the kinda guy

787
01:07:50.796 --> 01:07:53.197
that would square off
with a female.

788
01:08:01.073 --> 01:08:02.808
Did you shoot him?

789
01:08:02.941 --> 01:08:04.876
Why in the hell
did you shoot him?

790
01:08:05.010 --> 01:08:07.813
Better yet, why did you take off
with him after the play?

791
01:08:10.782 --> 01:08:13.985
Like I told your friend there,

792
01:08:14.119 --> 01:08:15.987
I didn't shoot him.

793
01:08:16.121 --> 01:08:18.857
I kinda just bumped into him
after the play.

794
01:08:18.990 --> 01:08:22.127
Bullshit, Pearl.
Someone had to shoot him.

795
01:08:22.259 --> 01:08:23.561
Huh.

796
01:08:23.695 --> 01:08:26.397
In the play,
he was shot with a real gun.

797
01:08:26.530 --> 01:08:29.000
- Mm.
- That was real.

798
01:08:29.134 --> 01:08:32.904
Holy shit. I thought
he was acting on that.

799
01:08:37.441 --> 01:08:40.277
Pearl put a ball in the chamber.

800
01:08:44.082 --> 01:08:45.217
You know.

801
01:08:47.686 --> 01:08:50.222
I'm still dying here.

802
01:08:50.354 --> 01:08:52.724
What?

803
01:08:52.858 --> 01:08:57.294
You can't even notice?
You're worthless.

804
01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:03.534
He's talking about you.

805
01:09:03.668 --> 01:09:06.403
I need help, you dumb ass.

806
01:09:06.537 --> 01:09:09.207
Now he's
talking about me.

807
01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:11.575
I swear,

808
01:09:11.710 --> 01:09:16.915
I've never met
a more ignorant group of...

809
01:09:19.251 --> 01:09:23.822
A... A...

810
01:09:23.955 --> 01:09:26.290
Oh!

811
01:09:26.423 --> 01:09:28.559
Damn it.

812
01:09:29.795 --> 01:09:31.630
Y'all got caught up
in conversing,

813
01:09:31.763 --> 01:09:33.832
I completely forgot about him.

814
01:09:35.267 --> 01:09:37.669
He look kinda bad.

815
01:09:37.803 --> 01:09:41.006
Poor bastard took quite
a beating from me earlier.

816
01:09:42.573 --> 01:09:44.676
Well, shit.

817
01:09:44.810 --> 01:09:47.511
He's dead. Another lost...
Another lost one.

818
01:09:47.646 --> 01:09:50.414
Dead and not alive.

819
01:09:50.548 --> 01:09:53.450
Hmm. You know what?
The way I see it,

820
01:09:53.584 --> 01:09:56.188
let's take the bounty,
split it three ways.

821
01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:58.156
Does that sound fair to you?

822
01:09:58.290 --> 01:09:59.590
- Fair.
- Fair enough.

823
01:09:59.724 --> 01:10:00.926
- Yeah.
- All right.

824
01:10:01.059 --> 01:10:02.828
- We should probably ride.
- Let's ride.

825
01:10:02.961 --> 01:10:05.063
Get the horses ready.
You know what?

826
01:10:05.197 --> 01:10:07.833
You should probably wrap him up
in a blanket like you do.

827
01:10:07.966 --> 01:10:09.400
Y'all hear that?

828
01:10:09.533 --> 01:10:11.435
- Señor!
- I do.

829
01:10:13.604 --> 01:10:15.273
Go get the horses ready.

830
01:10:15.406 --> 01:10:17.541
Pearl, let's find out
what's hollerin'.

831
01:10:19.211 --> 01:10:20.812
Wrap him up?

832
01:10:24.282 --> 01:10:27.351
Sergio, what are you
doing tied to a tree?

833
01:10:30.655 --> 01:10:32.190
You know him?

834
01:10:32.324 --> 01:10:36.828
Yeah. He was taken hostage
by Black Jack Bennet Gang.

835
01:10:36.962 --> 01:10:38.429
What were you doing here,
Sergio?

836
01:10:38.562 --> 01:10:39.931
Hold.

837
01:10:42.167 --> 01:10:44.836
- <i>Hola,</i> Señor Dynamite.
- What are you doing here?

838
01:10:48.073 --> 01:10:49.708
Hoodoo.

839
01:10:53.778 --> 01:10:55.412
He killed my wife.

840
01:10:57.849 --> 01:11:00.685
He take me out here again.

841
01:11:00.819 --> 01:11:02.419
He come back
looking for you guys.

842
01:11:02.553 --> 01:11:04.322
That was Hoodoo Brown?

843
01:11:04.455 --> 01:11:06.992
I heard of him.
That son of a bitch.

844
01:11:07.125 --> 01:11:09.094
You coming with us?

845
01:11:09.227 --> 01:11:10.628
No.

846
01:11:10.762 --> 01:11:14.531
I gotta go and, you know,
put my wife to rest.

847
01:11:14.666 --> 01:11:16.801
Ah, <i>sí.</i>

848
01:11:18.535 --> 01:11:20.404
Well, listen, Sergio.

849
01:11:20.537 --> 01:11:24.142
I'm really sorry for your loss.
I feel terrible about that.

850
01:11:24.276 --> 01:11:25.710
But, uh, I'll tell you what,

851
01:11:25.844 --> 01:11:28.647
we'll stop in and see you
on our next ride through there.

852
01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:31.650
Now, listen. Remember that piece
of paper I gave you?

853
01:11:31.783 --> 01:11:34.252
Are you listening?
Remember that piece of paper?

854
01:11:34.386 --> 01:11:36.655
That's how you're gonna reach me
when you hear something

855
01:11:36.788 --> 01:11:38.657
about the Black Jack Bennet
mine.

856
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:40.659
You remember something
about the mine?

857
01:11:40.792 --> 01:11:43.261
No Name!
I think he's gotta take a piss.

858
01:11:43.395 --> 01:11:46.131
I'm going to piss!

859
01:11:46.264 --> 01:11:47.899
Aah!

860
01:11:50.769 --> 01:11:53.437
<i>Adios,</i> Señor Dynamite!

861
01:12:17.896 --> 01:12:21.465
Get up. Hold up.
Don't go running in there.

862
01:12:21.598 --> 01:12:22.801
No, come on.

863
01:12:22.934 --> 01:12:24.169
What in the hell
she's doing now?

864
01:12:24.302 --> 01:12:26.805
She knows better.
She knows better than that.

865
01:12:30.875 --> 01:12:33.510
What in the world.

866
01:12:33.645 --> 01:12:35.347
Those kids.

867
01:12:39.317 --> 01:12:41.886
Oh, God. Oh!

868
01:12:51.863 --> 01:12:53.965
Name is Little Bill.
You've done been had.

869
01:12:54.099 --> 01:12:56.500
Now, hand that pistol over
nice and easy.

870
01:12:56.634 --> 01:12:58.003
That's nice.

871
01:12:58.136 --> 01:13:00.238
Stay down there with me
and don't move a muscle,

872
01:13:00.372 --> 01:13:01.940
or you're a dead woman.

873
01:13:27.332 --> 01:13:30.235
What in the Sam Hill
kinda shit is this?

874
01:13:30.368 --> 01:13:31.568
Ay-ya.

875
01:13:32.737 --> 01:13:35.507
That's one of them midgets
right there.

876
01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:37.108
Hey!

877
01:13:37.242 --> 01:13:39.244
This...

878
01:13:39.377 --> 01:13:40.745
I don't know what that is.

879
01:13:40.879 --> 01:13:44.315
That looks like
a goddamn train wreck.

880
01:13:44.449 --> 01:13:47.952
You gonna pay,
you rotten son of a bitch.

881
01:13:48.086 --> 01:13:49.988
You killed my brother,
Little Bill.

882
01:13:50.121 --> 01:13:51.588
I'm Little Mary,

883
01:13:51.723 --> 01:13:54.759
and you done messed
with the wrong midget.

884
01:13:54.893 --> 01:13:57.594
I mean, little person,
you prick.

885
01:13:57.729 --> 01:14:00.065
This here's my partner,
Little Peter,

886
01:14:00.198 --> 01:14:02.167
and he ain't one
to be fucked with either.

887
01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:05.637
Now, throw down your weapons,
asswipes.

888
01:14:06.838 --> 01:14:08.940
You heard the lady,
boys and girls.

889
01:14:09.074 --> 01:14:12.510
Throw down your guns.
We can end all this drama.

890
01:14:12.644 --> 01:14:15.080
Give me the body.
He is rightfully mine.

891
01:14:15.213 --> 01:14:19.684
If I can't have him,
none of you can.

892
01:14:19.818 --> 01:14:21.119
I've been following for years

893
01:14:21.252 --> 01:14:23.188
without him giving me
a second glance.

894
01:14:24.889 --> 01:14:26.991
It was meant to be.

895
01:14:29.327 --> 01:14:31.129
You.

896
01:14:31.262 --> 01:14:32.764
You ruined my plan.

897
01:14:32.897 --> 01:14:34.866
Now you must pay with your life.

898
01:14:34.999 --> 01:14:40.604
Oh, go on and make your play,
you crazy son of a bitch.

899
01:14:40.738 --> 01:14:42.707
Come get some,

900
01:14:42.841 --> 01:14:47.078
you and that sawed-off
little runt.

901
01:15:01.292 --> 01:15:02.961
What are you laughing at,
you idiots?

902
01:15:03.094 --> 01:15:05.363
Greetings, my friends.

903
01:15:07.098 --> 01:15:12.003
I'm sorry to say you
no longer have the advantage.

904
01:15:12.137 --> 01:15:15.540
Hey. You're the magician
who walked in the saloon.

905
01:15:15.673 --> 01:15:17.175
That's him, No Name.

906
01:15:17.308 --> 01:15:18.943
You did good
on that one trick, though.

907
01:15:19.077 --> 01:15:20.745
Stop this nonsense bullshit.

908
01:15:20.879 --> 01:15:22.680
You will speak when spoken to.

909
01:15:22.814 --> 01:15:24.349
One more word,

910
01:15:24.482 --> 01:15:29.420
and I will spill your guts
with two barrels of buckshot.

911
01:15:30.188 --> 01:15:34.359
Now, you're going to give us
the body of John Wilkes Booth

912
01:15:34.492 --> 01:15:36.261
on that horse.

913
01:15:38.763 --> 01:15:40.698
See,

914
01:15:40.832 --> 01:15:43.668
back in town,

915
01:15:43.801 --> 01:15:47.071
I saw this lovely lady...

916
01:15:47.205 --> 01:15:50.508
ride out on horse
with John Wilkes Booth's body,

917
01:15:50.643 --> 01:15:53.378
and she disappeared in thin air.

918
01:15:58.449 --> 01:16:01.986
Now, you kneel down,

919
01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.889
or your friend will be first.

920
01:16:05.023 --> 01:16:07.425
Come on. Get down.

921
01:16:07.559 --> 01:16:09.360
Mr. Taviano.

922
01:16:09.494 --> 01:16:12.864
If you please afford me
one last smoke.

923
01:16:12.997 --> 01:16:14.399
Fine.

924
01:16:14.532 --> 01:16:17.835
Why do you Americans
always want to be so dramatic?

925
01:16:17.969 --> 01:16:20.071
Just die already.

926
01:16:54.806 --> 01:16:58.109
I got you now,
you Rasputin prick.

927
01:16:59.544 --> 01:17:02.814
It's the last time you run out
on me, you no-paying pig.

928
01:17:02.947 --> 01:17:05.817
I chased you across two states,

929
01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:08.820
countless carnivals
and saloons,

930
01:17:08.953 --> 01:17:12.624
and four
very unreputable cathouses.

931
01:17:12.757 --> 01:17:14.459
Oh, my dearest.

932
01:17:14.592 --> 01:17:17.528
What a wonderful surprise
to see you, my lovely.

933
01:17:17.663 --> 01:17:19.564
We were so worried.

934
01:17:19.698 --> 01:17:21.700
Save it, peckerhead.

935
01:17:21.833 --> 01:17:25.136
It's time to pay the piper,
you unsavory son of a bitch.

936
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:28.239
But, my lovely, I never meant...

937
01:17:35.313 --> 01:17:38.549
I'm not playing. Time's up.

938
01:17:43.454 --> 01:17:46.090
Oh. Oh, please.

939
01:17:46.224 --> 01:17:48.826
I'm not falling
for one of your phony tricks.

940
01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:52.096
Hey, hold yourself together
and die like a man, pansy boy.

941
01:17:56.134 --> 01:18:00.171
I only beg for your forgiveness

942
01:18:00.305 --> 01:18:03.508
and hope we will meet again
one day,

943
01:18:03.642 --> 01:18:06.745
my delicate desert flower.

944
01:18:06.878 --> 01:18:13.184
Now, will you do me a favor
for one last time for a smoke?

945
01:18:13.951 --> 01:18:17.322
Now who's being dramatic?
You phony bastard.

946
01:18:18.724 --> 01:18:22.427
- Go on and burn one.
- But make it quick.

947
01:18:46.017 --> 01:18:47.218
What?

948
01:18:47.352 --> 01:18:49.354
No. No!

949
01:18:50.689 --> 01:18:52.323
No!

950
01:18:52.457 --> 01:18:53.659
No!

951
01:18:53.792 --> 01:18:56.994
Damn it! Damn! God... Blubberin'.

952
01:18:57.128 --> 01:18:59.631
You do not... No!

953
01:18:59.765 --> 01:19:01.899
You hunk of shit piece...

954
01:19:02.033 --> 01:19:04.402
No! This ain't how this goes!

955
01:19:04.535 --> 01:19:06.638
- He stiffed the whore!
- Rubber Jean, wait.

956
01:19:06.772 --> 01:19:08.272
Wait for me.

957
01:19:08.406 --> 01:19:10.743
Okay. Show's over.

958
01:19:10.875 --> 01:19:13.044
Let's go.

959
01:19:16.581 --> 01:19:17.982
She's dead.

960
01:19:20.318 --> 01:19:23.621
We need to hurry up.
Gotta make it to the camp.

961
01:19:23.756 --> 01:19:24.989
Well, I don't think

962
01:19:25.123 --> 01:19:27.358
they're gonna be any more
ridiculous distractions.

963
01:19:27.492 --> 01:19:29.394
Well, let's just make sure
there are not.

964
01:19:29.527 --> 01:19:31.562
- Okeydoke.
- Let's get going.

965
01:19:32.664 --> 01:19:35.166
Huh. Goddamn.

966
01:19:35.299 --> 01:19:38.269
That was the best damn trick
I ever did see.

967
01:19:38.403 --> 01:19:43.107
How far you figure
to the garrison in Owens?

968
01:19:43.241 --> 01:19:46.244
It shouldn't be more
than a couple days' ride

969
01:19:46.377 --> 01:19:48.579
if I figured correctly.

970
01:19:48.714 --> 01:19:51.549
That is,
if we keep our shit together.

971
01:20:00.057 --> 01:20:01.225
Ah.

972
01:20:03.027 --> 01:20:05.463
So, Pearl,

973
01:20:05.596 --> 01:20:10.001
how did you come about going
after John in the first place?

974
01:20:14.539 --> 01:20:16.607
Well, boys,

975
01:20:16.742 --> 01:20:19.577
I guess I'm kinda like y'all,
in that...

976
01:20:19.711 --> 01:20:22.079
I've done my fair share
of bounty hunting

977
01:20:22.213 --> 01:20:24.248
for quite some time.

978
01:20:35.894 --> 01:20:41.332
Aw. It's like the last time
I hooked up with No Name.

979
01:20:42.533 --> 01:20:45.036
I was chasing a bounty skip
at the time

980
01:20:45.169 --> 01:20:47.038
till I was smooth talked

981
01:20:47.171 --> 01:20:49.307
into spending
a better quality time

982
01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:52.376
with your friend here.

983
01:20:52.510 --> 01:20:54.111
Yee-ha!

984
01:20:59.617 --> 01:21:03.321
Well, then, Pearl, you must
tell me the whole story.

985
01:21:03.454 --> 01:21:05.757
All the gritty details.

986
01:21:05.891 --> 01:21:08.993
Don't leave nothing out.

987
01:21:09.126 --> 01:21:11.295
And I think we've heard enough
about that subject tonight.

988
01:21:11.429 --> 01:21:13.799
- No, no, no, no.
- Oh, yes.

989
01:21:13.932 --> 01:21:17.168
That's enough. I think
it's time we go to sleep.

990
01:21:17.301 --> 01:21:20.538
Oh.

991
01:22:06.384 --> 01:22:08.553
Someone's here.

992
01:22:29.507 --> 01:22:31.442
A horse is here, sir.

993
01:22:43.254 --> 01:22:44.856
Captain Forbes.

994
01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:46.357
Pearl.

995
01:22:46.490 --> 01:22:48.727
Got something for you.

996
01:22:50.896 --> 01:22:52.563
Hold this, darlin'.

997
01:22:56.068 --> 01:22:58.336
Thank you.

998
01:23:00.072 --> 01:23:01.439
All right. Shh.

999
01:23:14.285 --> 01:23:16.788
You got John Wilkes Booth?

1000
01:23:16.922 --> 01:23:19.357
- Yee-ha!
- She got John Wilkes Booth.

1001
01:23:19.490 --> 01:23:22.627
That's it, boys. Pack it in.
We're done.

1002
01:23:27.531 --> 01:23:29.968
Lieutenant,
take control of that body.

1003
01:23:30.102 --> 01:23:31.637
Yes, Captain.

1004
01:23:33.204 --> 01:23:37.541
Pearl, if you would be so kind
as to join me in my tent.

1005
01:23:37.676 --> 01:23:39.143
Well...

1006
01:23:43.547 --> 01:23:45.751
Hey, guys.
How did you find him?

1007
01:23:47.853 --> 01:23:51.155
How did you guys get
that son of a bitch?

1008
01:23:51.288 --> 01:23:54.592
Well, it's quite
an interesting story.

1009
01:23:54.726 --> 01:23:57.361
So, we first found John
in a cabin in the woods.

1010
01:23:57.495 --> 01:23:59.731
He come running in
like his ass was on fire.

1011
01:24:04.970 --> 01:24:07.105
Well, thank you, Captain.

1012
01:24:07.238 --> 01:24:09.173
My pleasure, ma'am.

1013
01:24:14.345 --> 01:24:15.781
Lieutenant.

1014
01:24:17.448 --> 01:24:19.583
Fetch some peanuts,
wine, that table.

1015
01:24:19.718 --> 01:24:20.686
Yes, sir.

1016
01:24:20.819 --> 01:24:22.921
Me and No Name there
were posted up,

1017
01:24:23.055 --> 01:24:24.723
just enjoying the night
like some normal...

1018
01:24:24.856 --> 01:24:28.794
Hold on a minute there,
Dynamite. Let's go.

1019
01:24:28.927 --> 01:24:30.796
No Name. Dynamite.

1020
01:24:30.929 --> 01:24:32.496
Join me, won't you?

1021
01:24:37.636 --> 01:24:39.738
Yeah. We're like Cornwallis.

1022
01:24:39.871 --> 01:24:41.773
You know Cornwallis?

1023
01:24:41.907 --> 01:24:43.274
Yes, I do.

1024
01:24:43.407 --> 01:24:44.876
Well, gentlemen...

1025
01:24:45.010 --> 01:24:46.178
Take this.

1026
01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:49.213
...I think a drink is in order.

1027
01:24:50.514 --> 01:24:53.384
You gotta pour heavier
on that one. Thank you.

1028
01:24:58.757 --> 01:25:01.960
Just introduced to
the United States of America.

1029
01:25:02.094 --> 01:25:03.128
Cheers, gents.

1030
01:25:03.260 --> 01:25:04.395
Cheers.

1031
01:25:04.528 --> 01:25:06.597
Roasted peanuts.

1032
01:25:06.732 --> 01:25:09.067
Crush those up.
Drink some wine with them.

1033
01:25:09.201 --> 01:25:10.836
They're amazing.

1034
01:25:16.074 --> 01:25:17.608
Good, ain't it?

1035
01:25:20.578 --> 01:25:22.881
So, where's Pearl?

1036
01:25:29.286 --> 01:25:30.889
Pearl's not important.

1037
01:25:31.022 --> 01:25:32.924
Where's Pearl?

1038
01:25:33.058 --> 01:25:36.627
Pearl's not important.
What's important is the reward.

1039
01:25:43.334 --> 01:25:45.637
- I disagree.
- Yeah.

1040
01:25:45.771 --> 01:25:49.875
For example... Dynamite, what
would you spend your reward on?

1041
01:25:51.342 --> 01:25:54.012
Well, I would spend it on buying

1042
01:25:54.146 --> 01:25:56.347
a whole lot of these peanuts
here, that's for sure.

1043
01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:58.917
So at the end of the day,

1044
01:25:59.050 --> 01:26:02.254
we're all just working
for peanuts.

1045
01:26:04.089 --> 01:26:06.524
Let me get this straight.

1046
01:26:06.658 --> 01:26:09.493
You gave the reward to Pearl,

1047
01:26:09.627 --> 01:26:11.863
and we get peanuts.

1048
01:26:15.466 --> 01:26:17.769
Horseshit.

1049
01:26:17.903 --> 01:26:20.371
- No Name, let's go.
- Hmm.

1050
01:26:24.242 --> 01:26:27.112
You know what?
This never would've happened

1051
01:26:27.245 --> 01:26:30.314
if you hadn't gotten involved
with that Pearl.

1052
01:26:33.285 --> 01:26:34.920
You're right.

1053
01:26:36.721 --> 01:26:38.890
You have fucked up.

1054
01:26:47.899 --> 01:26:49.533
Hey.

1055
01:26:50.501 --> 01:26:52.838
Stay warm, soldiers.

1056
01:28:08.079 --> 01:28:09.814
Pearl!

1057
