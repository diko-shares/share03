00:18:31.235 --> 00:18:34.538
[laughing]

185
00:18:35.874 --> 00:18:39.510
Now, those are
some good roasted peanuts.

186
00:18:48.153 --> 00:18:51.022
[laughing]

187
00:18:51.156 --> 00:18:52.858
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.

188
00:18:52.991 --> 00:18:54.893
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm.

189
00:18:56.228 --> 00:18:59.296
You know,
may I have some whiskey?

190
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.700
These, uh...

191
00:19:01.833 --> 00:19:05.569
These peanuts build up
a paste in your mouth.

192
00:19:15.412 --> 00:19:17.015
Ah.

193
00:19:17.149 --> 00:19:19.316
Now, that's some good shit
right there.

194
00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:21.086
Good shit.

195
00:19:21.219 --> 00:19:25.257
Say, uh, what are you playing
over there?

196
00:19:25.389 --> 00:19:26.357
Solitaire.

197
00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:29.628
I heard about that.

198
00:19:29.761 --> 00:19:32.731
But, uh, never had
the chance to play it.

199
00:19:32.864 --> 00:19:36.134
- You any good at it?
- <i>Sí, bueno.</i> He...

200
00:19:36.268 --> 00:19:37.468
No. Nothing.

201
00:19:37.601 --> 00:19:41.039
[speaking Spanish]

202
00:19:41.173 --> 00:19:43.942
Ooh, ooh. Too much tequila.
I gotta go pee-pee.

203
00:19:45.811 --> 00:19:48.445
Seems like quite
a difficult game.

204
00:19:48.579 --> 00:19:50.414
- [door open, closes]
- How does one play?

205
00:19:50.548 --> 00:19:53.084
Carefully.

206
00:19:53.218 --> 00:19:55.386
DYNAMITE: Hmm.

207
00:19:57.889 --> 00:19:59.791
Peanuts are fine.

208
00:19:59.925 --> 00:20:02.794
Let's cut to the chase,
shall we?

209
00:20:02.928 --> 00:20:07.331
Why are two gentlemen like you

210
00:20:07.464 --> 00:20:09.267
in my establishment?

211
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.837
Well, I couldn't agree more.

212
00:20:18.109 --> 00:20:20.477
Looking for this guy.

213
00:20:28.119 --> 00:20:30.922
I ain't never seen him.

214
00:20:32.123 --> 00:20:33.124
[yells]

215
00:20:34.326 --> 00:20:35.894
Help me out!

216
00:20:37.461 --> 00:20:40.364
[grunting]

217
00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:46.671
[groans]

218
00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:55.647
[yelling]

219
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:07.424
- Four. That was four.
- That was five.

220
00:21:07.558 --> 00:21:09.493
- That was four.
- That was five.

221
00:21:09.628 --> 00:21:12.664
That... One, two, three, four.

222
00:21:12.797 --> 00:21:16.533
One, two, three, four, and five.

223
00:21:16.668 --> 00:21:18.703
[speaking Spanish]

224
00:21:18.837 --> 00:21:21.472
Son of a bitch. God...

225
00:21:25.442 --> 00:21:26.878
Five.

226
00:21:28.113 --> 00:21:29.748
- That was six.
- That was five.

227
00:21:29.881 --> 00:21:30.715
Six.

228
00:21:30.849 --> 00:21:32.751
Goddamn it. That was five.

229
00:21:32.884 --> 00:21:35.887
One, two, three, four, five.

230
00:21:36.021 --> 00:21:37.989
Shh.

231
00:21:38.123 --> 00:21:41.960
[thumping]

232
00:21:42.093 --> 00:21:45.562
[thumping continues]

233
00:21:49.334 --> 00:21:51.535
[man screams]

234
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:54.306
Now, that was six.

235
00:21:54.438 --> 00:21:56.440
That was good.

236
00:21:57.876 --> 00:21:59.576
That was really good.

237
00:21:59.711 --> 00:22:01.313
Now, go get him.

238
00:22:01.445 --> 00:22:03.048
All right.

239
00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.729
All right, let's go, Mexican.

240
00:22:17.862 --> 00:22:20.932
Huh? [groans] <i>Gracias.</i>

241
00:22:51.062 --> 00:22:53.865
The horses are back there, sir.

242
00:22:53.999 --> 00:22:55.900
All right, Lieutenant.
What you got?

243
00:22:56.034 --> 00:22:59.871
There's a cabin
about a half mile up that trail.

244
00:23:00.005 --> 00:23:02.807
Sir, I suggest we reconnoiter
the position.

245
00:23:04.175 --> 00:23:05.576
Very well. Carry on.

246
00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:07.412
We'll send someone
down to the cabin,

247
00:23:07.578 --> 00:23:08.680
and then we'll set up.

248
00:23:08.813 --> 00:23:10.048
That sounds good and all,

249
00:23:10.181 --> 00:23:12.150
but if'n he ain't here,
we should just quit.

250
00:23:12.283 --> 00:23:15.086
I'm tired of chasing
this son of a bitch.

251
00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:22.827
We're all tired, Lieutenant.

252
00:23:22.961 --> 00:23:24.528
- Private.
- Yes, sir.

253
00:23:24.662 --> 00:23:27.665
Get your ass on up
to that farmhouse.

254
00:23:40.278 --> 00:23:43.415
Billy Goat Gang.

255
00:23:43.547 --> 00:23:45.683
It said "alive."

256
00:23:46.951 --> 00:23:50.722
I know. I know.
Like I said before...

257
00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:53.224
they like revenge.

258
00:23:54.926 --> 00:23:56.928
I did them a favor,
them old dirty bastards.

259
00:23:57.062 --> 00:24:00.231
NO NAME: We are not getting paid
on this job.

260
00:24:00.365 --> 00:24:02.033
Oh, stop your hollerin' already.

261
00:24:02.167 --> 00:24:05.503
Don't get all mad and your
unmentionables up in a wad.

262
00:24:05.637 --> 00:24:07.539
I'll straighten it out.

263
00:24:07.672 --> 00:24:09.774
Yeah, well,
you'd better see to it.

264
00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:14.145
And since we're gonna be
near a mercantile,

265
00:24:14.279 --> 00:24:16.514
we're gonna have to pick up
some supplies.

266
00:24:16.648 --> 00:24:19.583
The horses are gonna need
to be shod.

267
00:24:20.685 --> 00:24:24.355
By the way,
what are unmentionables?

268
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:28.093
[laughs]

269
00:24:32.063 --> 00:24:34.466
Don't forget to pick up
some dynamite...

270
00:24:34.598 --> 00:24:35.967
for Dynamite.

271
00:24:36.101 --> 00:24:37.902
Yeah.

272
00:24:38.036 --> 00:24:42.340
So, those old boys fell
for your candlestick trick, hmm?

273
00:24:42.474 --> 00:24:43.975
Yep.

274
00:24:44.109 --> 00:24:48.213
They were a little drunk
and feeble, so that helped.

275
00:24:48.346 --> 00:24:52.484
You know, I don't think they
could see all that well either.

276
00:24:52.616 --> 00:24:54.786
Hmm. Yeah.

277
00:24:54.919 --> 00:24:58.656
They don't listen either.

278
00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:00.358
So the church.

279
00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:04.262
How many sticks did you use?

280
00:25:09.701 --> 00:25:11.870
Ah, fuck.

281
00:25:14.506 --> 00:25:16.407
You gotta be kidding me.

282
00:25:18.943 --> 00:25:20.912
23 sticks in all.

283
00:25:21.045 --> 00:25:23.748
Ah, you wasteful shitbird.

284
00:25:23.882 --> 00:25:25.950
[laughs] I know.

285
00:25:26.084 --> 00:25:28.286
You know, you could've done
twice as much damage

286
00:25:28.419 --> 00:25:30.455
with half as many.

287
00:25:31.222 --> 00:25:34.192
Probably. But you know
I like to do my job

288
00:25:34.325 --> 00:25:36.027
as thorough as possible.

289
00:25:37.896 --> 00:25:40.465
[laughs, snorts]

290
00:25:40.598 --> 00:25:42.133
Ay.

291
00:25:46.471 --> 00:25:47.405
Ah.

292
00:25:47.539 --> 00:25:49.642
Don't mind if I do.

293
00:25:49.774 --> 00:25:52.710
- [doorknob rattling]
- [guns cock]

294
00:26:03.221 --> 00:26:07.225
Whew! Oh, my God. Oh, my Lord.
They're chasing me.

295
00:26:07.358 --> 00:26:10.228
They wanna kill me.
Help me, please.

296
00:26:10.361 --> 00:26:12.163
- Who's chasing you?
- Them.

297
00:26:12.297 --> 00:26:14.832
Yes. Them.
But who the hell's them?

298
00:26:16.834 --> 00:26:18.236
Where are you going?

299
00:26:18.369 --> 00:26:20.572
Stop your
stammerin' around, mister.

300
00:26:20.705 --> 00:26:22.340
What's your name?

301
00:26:22.473 --> 00:26:24.108
Help, please.

302
00:26:25.276 --> 00:26:26.511
- [cries out]
- Name!

303
00:26:26.645 --> 00:26:30.048
I don't know!
I don't want them to find me.

304
00:26:30.515 --> 00:26:32.283
My name's John.

305
00:26:33.351 --> 00:26:34.352
John.

306
00:26:34.485 --> 00:26:35.920
[cries out]

307
00:26:38.691 --> 00:26:40.258
[spits]

308
00:26:40.391 --> 00:26:41.726
Wait.

309
00:26:41.859 --> 00:26:43.662
Are you with them?

310
00:26:43.795 --> 00:26:46.731
Are you vigilantes? Hired men?

311
00:26:46.864 --> 00:26:47.865
- No.
- No.

312
00:26:47.999 --> 00:26:51.135
Oh! Good. Thank you.

313
00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:53.672
Well, you could
help me possibly.

314
00:26:53.805 --> 00:26:56.207
They're coming for me.
A lot of them.

315
00:27:02.213 --> 00:27:03.214
Oh.

316
00:27:03.348 --> 00:27:05.783
I don't see anyone
at the present moment.

317
00:27:05.917 --> 00:27:07.852
NO NAME: Nobody?

318
00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:13.157
Mister, I suggest you tell us
what's going on.

319
00:27:13.291 --> 00:27:16.761
[grunts] Please!
They wanna take my life!

320
00:27:16.894 --> 00:27:19.130
I haven't done anything.

321
00:27:19.264 --> 00:27:23.268
I beg you.
I beg you for mercy. Please.

322
00:27:23.401 --> 00:27:25.036
DYNAMITE: Mercy?

323
00:27:25.169 --> 00:27:27.205
- I don't know.
- I don't like this guy.

324
00:27:27.338 --> 00:27:30.008
- [yells]
- Quit your whining.

325
00:27:31.042 --> 00:27:33.244
[guns cock]

326
00:27:34.479 --> 00:27:37.415
You can hurt me,
but you will not take my life.

327
00:27:37.548 --> 00:27:39.784
Oh, shut up!

328
00:27:39.917 --> 00:27:42.153
Or we will kill you.

329
00:27:42.287 --> 00:27:45.490
Not one word unless spoken to.
You understand?

330
00:27:48.526 --> 00:27:50.328
Oh, Jesus.

331
00:27:50.461 --> 00:27:54.165
I'm terribly thirsty.
You have anything to drink?

332
00:27:58.503 --> 00:27:59.971
Thank you.

333
00:28:00.104 --> 00:28:02.040
Oh, thank you.

334
00:28:06.477 --> 00:28:08.279
[sets bottle down]

335
00:28:21.426 --> 00:28:23.796
[groans] Oh!

336
00:28:23.928 --> 00:28:25.063
[laughing]

337
00:28:25.196 --> 00:28:27.965
Ah, fine. I'll tell you.
I'll tell you.

338
00:28:28.099 --> 00:28:30.234
- Naa!
- [gasps]

339
00:28:30.368 --> 00:28:32.170
- Didn't I tell him?
- You told him.

340
00:28:32.303 --> 00:28:33.739
- I told him, right?
- You told him.

341
00:28:33.871 --> 00:28:35.273
- You heard me.
- I heard you.

342
00:28:35.406 --> 00:28:38.176
He heard me. How many times
do I gotta tell you?

343
00:28:38.309 --> 00:28:41.647
Not to speak unless spoken to.

344
00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:44.615
The bullshit act
stops here, John.

345
00:28:50.988 --> 00:28:54.225
Until spoken to.

346
00:29:11.142 --> 00:29:12.877
Very well.

347
00:29:14.747 --> 00:29:16.815
I was acting in a play.

348
00:29:16.948 --> 00:29:19.484
I'm an actor, you see.

349
00:29:19.617 --> 00:29:22.755
And a damn good one,
I might add.

350
00:29:23.689 --> 00:29:27.693
Some say maybe the best
in the world, I tell you.

351
00:29:27.826 --> 00:29:29.260
In my last performance,

352
00:29:29.394 --> 00:29:32.865
I went to procure payment
for my services,

353
00:29:32.997 --> 00:29:35.566
where I was pounced upon
by the stagehands

354
00:29:35.701 --> 00:29:37.969
and believe I suffered
a broken leg

355
00:29:38.102 --> 00:29:40.471
due to this misfortune.

356
00:29:40.605 --> 00:29:43.174
The producers
thought I was someone else.

357
00:29:43.307 --> 00:29:45.576
A charlatan of some sort.

358
00:29:47.846 --> 00:29:52.684
Now, if you fine gentlemen
could help me back to my hotel

359
00:29:52.818 --> 00:29:56.187
in secrecy and protect me,

360
00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.223
I would pay you handsomely
for your services.

361
00:29:59.357 --> 00:30:03.127
I have $12,000 waiting
in a safe deposit box

362
00:30:03.261 --> 00:30:05.329
