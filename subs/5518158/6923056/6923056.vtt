(♪♪♪)

6
00:02:08.985 --> 00:02:10.404
Well, you look beautiful.

7
00:02:10.486 --> 00:02:11.530
Thank you.

8
00:02:15.658 --> 00:02:16.700
What was that for?

9
00:02:16.783 --> 00:02:18.285
To remind you that
we're speaking at the conference

10
00:02:18.368 --> 00:02:19.912
in a few hours.

11
00:02:19.995 --> 00:02:20.954
Wait, that's today?

12
00:02:21.038 --> 00:02:22.955
What day did you think it was?

13
00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:24.415
I don't know, tomorrow.

14
00:02:24.498 --> 00:02:26.625
Look, I'm pretty sure
you can handle it without me.

15
00:02:26.708 --> 00:02:27.792
I've got a lot of work to do.

16
00:02:27.876 --> 00:02:30.587
I need to figure out
which trail has the best chances

17
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.171
of us finding something and
right now.

18
00:02:32.253 --> 00:02:33.005
- It's not like...
- Glen, suck it up

19
00:02:33.088 --> 00:02:35.382
and get ready.

20
00:02:35.466 --> 00:02:37.008
If I do this one,
you have to promise

21
00:02:37.091 --> 00:02:39.135
I won't have to ever again.

22
00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:40.677
I promise.

23
00:02:42.387 --> 00:02:44.556
You know, I can always tell
when you're lying.

24
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.723
We leave in an hour.

25
00:02:45.806 --> 00:02:47.183
Okay.

26
00:02:47.266 --> 00:02:57.274
(♪♪♪)

27
00:03:03.363 --> 00:03:04.905
Excuse me.

28
00:03:04.988 --> 00:03:07.241
Could you all ple...
could you all sign my dinosaur,

29
00:03:07.324 --> 00:03:08.282
- please?
- Yeah, sure.

30
00:03:08.367 --> 00:03:10.076
- Sure.
- Yeah.

31
00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.619
My son's a big fan,

32
00:03:11.702 --> 00:03:14.121
he watches
all your expedition videos.

33
00:03:14.205 --> 00:03:17.207
(Indistinct chatter)

34
00:03:19.583 --> 00:03:21.043
There you go.

35
00:03:21.126 --> 00:03:23.878
I'd like to find dinosaurs
and monsters with you when I...

36
00:03:23.962 --> 00:03:25.338
when I grow up.

37
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:26.881
Hey, well, I look forward to
working with you,

38
00:03:26.965 --> 00:03:29.007
I think you're gonna make
a great monster hunter.

39
00:03:29.091 --> 00:03:30.592
- Thanks.
- Thank you, both.

40
00:03:30.676 --> 00:03:31.718
He's a little shy,

41
00:03:31.802 --> 00:03:33.552
but this means the world
to him.

42
00:03:33.636 --> 00:03:36.180
Well, thank you, guys,
for coming.

43
00:03:36.264 --> 00:03:37.306
Thank you.

44
00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.141
(Indistinct chatter)

45
00:03:40.225 --> 00:03:40.809
Where is he?

46
00:03:40.892 --> 00:03:43.686
We do not have much time.

47
00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.688
Hey guys, sorry, I'm late.
Uh, which room is it in?

48
00:03:45.771 --> 00:03:46.689
GLEN:
It's in room 4.

49
00:03:46.772 --> 00:03:48.189
We'll be on in about 15 minutes.

50
00:03:48.273 --> 00:03:49.857
Oh, it'll only take me a second
to set up.

51
00:03:52.277 --> 00:03:54.903
Now, I hope you're all having
a wonderful time.

52
00:03:54.986 --> 00:03:56.738
Well, it's going to get
even better.

53
00:03:56.822 --> 00:03:59.156
I'm sure that most
if not all of you have heard

54
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.534
of our next speakers,
Glen Craven and Lily Lantz,

55
00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:03.994
who are here to discuss with us

56
00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:05.912
the details
of their latest endeavor.

57
00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:09.373
So please give a big round
of applause to Glen and Lily.

58
00:04:09.456 --> 00:04:12.458
(Applause)

59
00:04:16.337 --> 00:04:18.587
Thank you all so much
for being with us today.

60
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:20.299
Now, I'm sure
you all are wondering

61
00:04:20.382 --> 00:04:21.966
where our next
research expedition

62
00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.843
is going to be.

63
00:04:23.926 --> 00:04:28.388
Aliens, strange lights,
people completely vanishing,

64
00:04:28.471 --> 00:04:30.181
monsters.

65
00:04:30.265 --> 00:04:33.684
This, ladies and gentlemen,
is Mount Adams.

66
00:04:33.767 --> 00:04:36.144
The mountain is most known
for its strange

67
00:04:36.227 --> 00:04:38.104
lights phenomenon.

68
00:04:38.187 --> 00:04:41.273
This is a still from a video
captured by a couple

69
00:04:41.356 --> 00:04:42.899
that went hiking
on the mountain.

70
00:04:42.983 --> 00:04:44.776
This man was driving
by the mountain

71
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.485
when he saw that.

72
00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:50.031
This is a photo taken
by a farmer at dusk

73
00:04:50.114 --> 00:04:52.324
about an hour
after he saw the lights

74
00:04:52.407 --> 00:04:53.408
appear on the mountain.

75
00:04:53.491 --> 00:04:55.617
What's interesting
is people only report

76
00:04:55.701 --> 00:04:56.952
seeing these creatures

77
00:04:57.036 --> 00:04:59.371
after the red lights
have been sighted.

78
00:04:59.455 --> 00:05:01.247
Now of course,
there are a lot of theories

79
00:05:01.331 --> 00:05:04.624
which try to explain away
the lights and the creatures

80
00:05:04.708 --> 00:05:06.043
uh, which we will be covering
in our upcoming...

81
00:05:06.126 --> 00:05:07.878
...we've told you the stories
of eyewitnesses,

82
00:05:07.961 --> 00:05:09.754
we've showed you
the photographs,

83
00:05:09.837 --> 00:05:12.923
and now we are pretty much
out of time,

84
00:05:13.007 --> 00:05:15.759
but I think we can answer
at least one question.

85
00:05:17.302 --> 00:05:19.803
Uh, you in the front.

86
00:05:19.887 --> 00:05:22.389
When do you plan to start
and how long do you expect

87
00:05:22.473 --> 00:05:23.682
to stay on the mountain?

88
00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:27.935
Yes, well, actually uh,
we'll be leaving tomorrow

89
00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:30.437
and uh, we'll be up there
for three days.

90
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.480
Uh, we'll be bringing cameras,
camera traps,

91
00:05:33.564 --> 00:05:36.942
anything to help us uh,
capture some footage and some-

92
00:05:37.026 --> 00:05:40.653
some good evidence of uh,
whatever's up there.

93
00:05:40.737 --> 00:05:41.696
Uh, by the way a shout out

94
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.948
to our awesome
camera tech guy Blake,

95
00:05:45.032 --> 00:05:48.326
who will be joining us
along with a few other people.

96
00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:49.786
Hope that answers the question.

97
00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:52.038
I am so sorry,
but we are out of time.

98
00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:53.372
We'll be back at our booth
to answer

99
00:05:53.455 --> 00:05:55.040
any more of your questions.

100
00:05:55.123 --> 00:05:56.291
Thank you so much
for coming out

101
00:05:56.375 --> 00:05:58.125
and hearing us speak today.

102
00:05:58.209 --> 00:05:59.043
Thanks.

103
00:05:59.126 --> 00:06:02.046
(Applause)

104
00:06:02.128 --> 00:06:08.175
(♪♪♪)

105
00:06:08.258 --> 00:06:11.220
(Indistinct chatter)

106
00:06:11.303 --> 00:06:12.387
Did you enjoy today?

107
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.555
Oh, yeah, definitely.

108
00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:18.850
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

109
00:06:18.934 --> 00:06:21.560
Hey uh, my uncle practically
lives on Mount Adams.

110
00:06:21.644 --> 00:06:23.562
He could be your guide
if you guys want one.

111
00:06:23.646 --> 00:06:24.814
- That would be awesome.
- Yeah.

112
00:06:24.897 --> 00:06:26.773
Alright uh, my name is Louis.

113
00:06:26.856 --> 00:06:28.400
Here's his name and number.

114
00:06:28.483 --> 00:06:29.818
Louis, thank you so much.

115
00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:30.943
Yep.

116
00:06:31.026 --> 00:06:31.944
Just tell him Louis sent you.

117
00:06:32.027 --> 00:06:33.112
- Thank you.
- Perfect.

118
00:06:33.194 --> 00:06:33.904
- Thank you so much, Louis.
- Yeah, no problem.

119
00:06:33.987 --> 00:06:36.447
- Thanks, Louis.
- Hi, guys.

120
00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:37.865
I look... I really look forward
to reading your book.

121
00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:38.991
Oh, thank you so much.

122
00:06:39.075 --> 00:06:48.707
(♪♪♪)

123
00:06:48.791 --> 00:06:50.666
You okay?

124
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.002
No, I still can't find a trail
that's opened,

125
00:06:53.086 --> 00:06:54.129
they're all closed off.

126
00:06:54.212 --> 00:06:56.004
Look, you have no access here,
no access here,

127
00:06:56.088 --> 00:06:57.213
they... they're all closed.

128
00:06:57.297 --> 00:06:58.465
I think we're gonna be fine.

129
00:06:58.549 --> 00:06:59.924
Just give that guy a call.

130
00:07:03.052 --> 00:07:04.137
What guy?

131
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.762
That guy's uncle that lives
next to the mountain.

132
00:07:05.846 --> 00:07:07.556
He said if we needed a guide,
that he'd help.

133
00:07:10.516 --> 00:07:12.768
Well, he's pretty much
our only shot at this point,

134
00:07:12.852 --> 00:07:15.770
so I'll just give him a call
tomorrow morning.

135
00:07:15.854 --> 00:07:17.063
Okay.

136
00:07:17.147 --> 00:07:27.697
(♪♪♪)

137
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.074
But unless he actually
has access to the trails,

138
00:07:31.158 --> 00:07:32.283
there's no...

139
00:07:32.367 --> 00:07:33.409
(Grunting)

140
00:07:33.492 --> 00:07:34.577
No, I'm being serious.

141
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.454
- We'll be fine.
- There's...

142
00:07:36.537 --> 00:07:38.079
Don't worry about it.

143
00:07:38.163 --> 00:07:39.038
(Chuckles)

144
00:07:39.122 --> 00:07:41.583
Oh, what would I ever do
without you?

145
00:07:41.666 --> 00:07:43.709
(Sighing)

146
00:07:43.792 --> 00:07:45.669
You'd be sad and alone.

147
00:07:45.752 --> 00:07:47.546
(Chuckling)

148
00:07:47.628 --> 00:07:49.046
Goodnight.

149
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.465
Goodnight.

150
00:07:50.548 --> 00:08:00.431
(♪♪♪)

151
00:08:01.557 --> 00:08:04.559
(Whirring)

152
00:08:11.689 --> 00:08:12.732
Oh, hey guys.

153
00:08:12.815 --> 00:08:13.608
So where's the little guy?

154
00:08:13.691 --> 00:08:14.817
Is he comin', too?

155
00:08:14.901 --> 00:08:17.319
Yep uh, we have to go
to his house to pick him up

156
00:08:17.402 --> 00:08:21.114
and by the way,
his sister's coming, too.

157
00:08:21.197 --> 00:08:22.031
- Okay.
- Oh, okay.

158
00:08:22.114 --> 00:08:23.073
You guys might wanna hurry
though,

159
00:08:23.157 --> 00:08:24.617
they're not gonna be happy
that we're late.

160
00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:29.871
Alright,
you guys got everything?

161
00:08:29.954 --> 00:08:30.829
Yep, we'll see you there.

162
00:08:30.913 --> 00:08:32.206
See you there.

163
00:08:34.374 --> 00:08:44.382
(♪♪♪)

164
00:08:55.933 --> 00:08:56.934
Hey, Thomas.

165
00:08:57.017 --> 00:08:58.560
About time you pisspots
showed up.

166
00:08:58.644 --> 00:09:00.561
Come on, it's cool
to be fashionably late!

167
00:09:00.645 --> 00:09:02.104
Fashionable, my ass.

168
00:09:02.188 --> 00:09:03.564
That's what you call it.

169
00:09:11.779 --> 00:09:13.447
Can you do anything by yourself?

170
00:09:13.531 --> 00:09:15.031
I can, but I won't.

171
00:09:15.114 --> 00:09:25.122
(♪♪♪)

172
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:36.006
(Grunting)

173
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.591
Hey guys, uh,
whoever wants to shower

174
00:09:37.675 --> 00:09:38.925
should probably take one now.

175
00:09:39.008 --> 00:09:41.010
Nah, I'm good,
but it might be the last shower

176
00:09:41.094 --> 00:09:42.803
you ever take
before the aliens get you.

177
00:09:42.886 --> 00:09:44.846
- And why wouldn't they get you?
- Simple.

178
00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:46.723
Aliens would be like,
"Ew, what a smelly boy!",

179
00:09:46.807 --> 00:09:48.558
and then I'd just sit back,
and watch all you butt-clowns

180
00:09:48.641 --> 00:09:50.309
get snatched up into space.

181
00:09:50.393 --> 00:09:52.936
Um, I'll take my chances
with that, so...

182
00:09:54.312 --> 00:09:55.438
Hey, I'll take one with you,

183
00:09:55.522 --> 00:09:57.106
so we'll save water
for everybody.

184
00:09:57.189 --> 00:09:58.983
Okay, but you're not borrowing
my shampoos.

185
00:09:59.066 --> 00:10:00.859
Mm.

186
00:10:00.943 --> 00:10:03.278
Hey, anybody wanna take
a steamy hot shower with me?

187
00:10:03.361 --> 00:10:05.488
How about you,
Professor Peanut?

188
00:10:05.572 --> 00:10:07.990
Not in a million years.

189
00:10:08.073 --> 00:10:09.908
Oh, well, it's your loss.

190
00:10:09.992 --> 00:10:11.701
Yes, it is.

191
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.458
Hey, I'm gonna go watch
the sunset, so...

192
00:10:20.542 --> 00:10:21.333
- Okay.
- I'll be back.

193
00:10:21.417 --> 00:10:22.626
Okay, hang on,
I'll come with you.

194
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:23.752
Uh, okay.

195
00:10:23.836 --> 00:10:33.844
(♪♪♪)

196
00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:51.608
(Phone ringing)

197
00:10:54.152 --> 00:10:55.944
(Grunting)

198
00:10:56.028 --> 00:10:58.405
BLAKE: Hey,
we got an interview in 30 minutes.

199
00:11:03.492 --> 00:11:06.286
- (Grunting)
- Piss off.

200
00:11:06.369 --> 00:11:07.912
Oh, crap.

201
00:11:12.458 --> 00:11:15.460
Hey, we'll be back in an hour
or two, okay?

202
00:11:15.543 --> 00:11:15.918
Okay.

203
00:11:16.002 --> 00:11:17.920
Alright.

204
00:11:18.004 --> 00:11:21.340
Come on, get up,
we gotta go.

205
00:11:21.423 --> 00:11:23.133
Oh.

206
00:11:28.136 --> 00:11:29.804
Okay, so who's... Richard first?

207
00:11:29.888 --> 00:11:31.556
Yes, Richard.

208
00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:32.599
(Indistinct speech)

209
00:11:32.682 --> 00:11:34.058
Yeah.

210
00:11:34.141 --> 00:11:44.149
(♪♪♪)

211
00:11:46.902 --> 00:11:48.194
(Knock on door)

212
00:11:52.822 --> 00:11:53.823
- Howdy folks.
- Hi.

213
00:11:53.907 --> 00:11:55.575
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

214
00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.160
Hi.

215
00:12:03.706 --> 00:12:04.749
Oh, here, here.

216
00:12:04.832 --> 00:12:06.209
S... sorry about the mess.

217
00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:09.711
Uh, I don't get visitors here
too often.

218
00:12:09.795 --> 00:12:11.712
N... now you can make yourselves
to home, but-

219
00:12:11.796 --> 00:12:13.839
but not too much, huh?

220
00:12:13.923 --> 00:12:15.216
Hey, anybody want a drink?

221
00:12:15.299 --> 00:12:16.966
- Uh, I'm okay.
- No, no, I... I'm good.

222
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.426
I'll have a beer!

223
00:12:20.969 --> 00:12:22.638
- There you go.
- Thanks.

224
00:12:22.721 --> 00:12:24.973
8:00 a.m. in the morning, man
who likes beer.

225
00:12:25.057 --> 00:12:26.724
That's a man who knows
what's good for him.

226
00:12:26.808 --> 00:12:30.061
Hey, there's 24 beers in a case,
24 hours in a day.

227
00:12:30.144 --> 00:12:33.063
I don't think
that's a coincidence.

228
00:12:33.146 --> 00:12:34.022
Oh.

229
00:12:34.106 --> 00:12:35.856
Yeah, uh.

230
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:36.899
Put that right there,
and we should be all set.

231
00:12:36.982 --> 00:12:38.943
Okay.

232
00:12:39.026 --> 00:12:41.569
Are we almost ready
for the interview?

233
00:12:41.653 --> 00:12:43.405
- Yeah, we're set to go.
- GLEN: Cool.

234
00:12:43.488 --> 00:12:45.280
Alright, we are here today
with Richard Croos

235
00:12:45.364 --> 00:12:47.658
who lives next to the mountain
and he has some knowledge

236
00:12:47.741 --> 00:12:49.951
he'd like to share with us
regarding the mysterious

237
00:12:50.034 --> 00:12:52.745
alien phenomenon
surrounding Mount Adams.

238
00:12:52.829 --> 00:12:53.996
Richard, could you tell us
a little bit about

239
00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.330
your history here.

240
00:12:55.414 --> 00:12:57.624
Oh-ho, I've been here
all my life.

241
00:12:57.708 --> 00:12:59.959
My father actually bought
the farm a month

242
00:13:00.042 --> 00:13:02.002
before I was born.

243
00:13:02.086 --> 00:13:04.713
And what do you think about
all the UFO stories?

244
00:13:04.796 --> 00:13:08.174
Oh, there's lots of UFOs
and lights uh, around, they're...

245
00:13:08.258 --> 00:13:09.717
they're not harmful.

246
00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.260
It's... it's what comes out
of the red

247
00:13:11.343 --> 00:13:13.429
that you have to worry about.

248
00:13:13.512 --> 00:13:17.974
Uh, the normal flying things
around the mountain are...

249
00:13:18.057 --> 00:13:18.974
are... are not a problem.

250
00:13:19.057 --> 00:13:20.392
My father taught me
that the only time

251
00:13:20.475 --> 00:13:24.270
you have to worry is
if the lights are red,

252
00:13:24.353 --> 00:13:25.980
then you gotta get the hell
out of there.

253
00:13:26.063 --> 00:13:29.274
Do... do the red lights
like attack people or...

254
00:13:29.357 --> 00:13:32.193
No, it's what comes out
of the red lights.

255
00:13:32.277 --> 00:13:35.112
Um, monsters or aliens
or something,

256
00:13:35.195 --> 00:13:38.614
they come out and they hang
around for a couple of nights.

257
00:13:38.698 --> 00:13:45.912
Oh, it... they steal livestock,
sometimes people, but it's uh...

258
00:13:45.996 --> 00:13:49.665
it's somethin' that
we have to keep an eye on.

259
00:13:49.749 --> 00:13:52.250
Well, how often do people see
these red lights?

260
00:13:52.333 --> 00:13:55.003
Mm, depends on the time of year.

261
00:13:55.086 --> 00:13:56.629
Maybe once a year.

262
00:13:56.713 --> 00:13:59.006
That's once too often
for my mind.

263
00:13:59.089 --> 00:14:01.550
Uh, we... we keep an eye on...
on it around here

264
00:14:01.632 --> 00:14:03.593
and call each other up
if anybody sees a red light

265
00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:05.428
up on that mountain.

266
00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:07.512
Uh, it's kinda like
a neighborhood watch...

267
00:14:07.596 --> 00:14:10.348
- (Chuckles)
- But for aliens.

268
00:14:10.432 --> 00:14:12.725
So has anybody like tried
to predict

269
00:14:12.808 --> 00:14:14.351
when the lights will appear?

270
00:14:14.435 --> 00:14:15.394
Oh, yeah.

271
00:14:15.478 --> 00:14:16.936
Yeah, I know somebody
who does that.

272
00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.897
Uh, he knows a lot more about it
than I do,

273
00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.356
anybody else for that matter.

274
00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.900
Oh, would... would you be willing
to give us his contact info,

275
00:14:22.983 --> 00:14:24.109
so we can talk to him?

276
00:14:24.193 --> 00:14:25.194
Oh, of course.

277
00:14:25.277 --> 00:14:26.360
Uh, as a matter of fact
he's a neighbor mine,

278
00:14:26.444 --> 00:14:28.529
just lives a couple houses down.

279
00:14:28.613 --> 00:14:30.239
- That's great.
- Sure.

280
00:14:30.323 --> 00:14:33.366
Uh... uh,
is there any other questions?

281
00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:34.868
I think I've given you
all I want

282
00:14:34.951 --> 00:14:37.870
for this docudramatary
or whatever it is.

283
00:14:37.953 --> 00:14:38.704
Uh, no, no.

284
00:14:38.788 --> 00:14:39.663
You've... you've been great.

285
00:14:39.747 --> 00:14:41.247
This has been a good interview.

286
00:14:41.331 --> 00:14:42.582
Sure thing.

287
00:14:42.665 --> 00:14:43.458
Thanks.

288
00:14:47.461 --> 00:14:48.837
Thank you.

289
00:14:48.921 --> 00:14:50.129
Yeah.

290
00:14:50.213 --> 00:14:51.130
Okay.

291
00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.383
Yeah well, thanks again so much
for letting us interview you.

292
00:14:55.467 --> 00:14:56.343
Oh, yeah.

293
00:14:56.426 --> 00:14:58.345
No problem,
you seem like good people.

294
00:14:58.428 --> 00:14:59.595
Thank you again,
really appreciate it.

295
00:14:59.678 --> 00:15:01.847
Yes.

296
00:15:01.931 --> 00:15:03.057
Hey, and thanks for the beers.

297
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.058
Hey, anytime, son.

298
00:15:05.141 --> 00:15:06.142
Hey.

299
00:15:08.186 --> 00:15:10.562
One piece of advice.

300
00:15:10.646 --> 00:15:12.689
Be careful.

301
00:15:12.773 --> 00:15:14.732
I don't know if you believe
in all this,

302
00:15:14.816 --> 00:15:16.859
but it sure as hell is real.

303
00:15:18.401 --> 00:15:20.695
Alright, I'll...
I'll remember that.

304
00:15:20.779 --> 00:15:30.787
(♪♪♪)

305
00:15:33.997 --> 00:15:35.499
So where to, boss?

306
00:15:35.582 --> 00:15:37.459
Let's go
to his neighbor's place,

307
00:15:37.542 --> 00:15:40.086
so let's see if he's home,
right down there.

308
00:15:40.169 --> 00:15:41.546
Alright, sounds like a plan.

309
00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:49.635
(♪♪♪)

310
00:16:01.311 --> 00:16:03.604
(Knock on door)

311
00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:10.652
- Hello.
- Hey.

312
00:16:10.735 --> 00:16:11.777
What can I do for you?

313
00:16:11.861 --> 00:16:13.529
We were sent here
by Richard Croos.

314
00:16:13.612 --> 00:16:15.030
Uh, he... he said
you could help us find out

315
00:16:15.114 --> 00:16:16.906
when the lights on the mountain
will appear.

316
00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:17.907
Oh, yeah, sure, sure.

317
00:16:17.991 --> 00:16:18.992
- Come on in.
- Uh, thanks.

318
00:16:19.075 --> 00:16:20.701
Please.

319
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.542
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

320
00:16:30.625 --> 00:16:32.586
You guys are gonna love this.

321
00:16:36.964 --> 00:16:38.090
Okay.

322
00:16:41.759 --> 00:16:43.970
Okay, okay.

323
00:16:44.053 --> 00:16:46.680
These are predictions
when the light appear next.

324
00:16:46.763 --> 00:16:49.182
Um, what day is today?

325
00:16:49.266 --> 00:16:51.017
I believe it's the 2nd.

326
00:16:54.311 --> 00:16:55.312
Look at here.

327
00:16:55.395 --> 00:16:56.813
Sometime around tomorrow night
will be

328
00:16:56.897 --> 00:17:01.358
when the red lights appear
again, so um, saying m...

329
00:17:01.442 --> 00:17:04.776
uh, like probably
maybe 50% chance.

330
00:17:04.861 --> 00:17:06.362
Sounds like
it's worth a shot to me.

331
00:17:06.446 --> 00:17:08.238
Yeah, say would you like
to join us?

332
00:17:08.323 --> 00:17:09.572
We'd love to have you on board.

333
00:17:09.656 --> 00:17:11.449
- Really?
- Yeah.

334
00:17:11.533 --> 00:17:12.909
That'd be great.

335
00:17:12.993 --> 00:17:14.034
Do you know
where the ranger station

336
00:17:14.118 --> 00:17:16.494
- is off of Highway 141?
- Well, yes.

337
00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:18.413
- Of course, yes, I do.
- Perfect.

338
00:17:18.495 --> 00:17:20.665
That's where we're meeting
our guide before we head on up.

339
00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:22.500
Just be there at 2:00
this afternoon.

340
00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:24.501
Hey guys, we got an interview
to do in 15 minutes.

341
00:17:24.585 --> 00:17:26.502
- We gotta go to Debbie's house.
- Oh, right.

342
00:17:26.587 --> 00:17:28.504
Um, yeah, but we gotta run,

343
00:17:28.588 --> 00:17:33.842
but let's see,
here is my number,

344
00:17:33.926 --> 00:17:36.553
just in case you need
to call me.

345
00:17:36.637 --> 00:17:37.929
Okay, will do.

346
00:17:38.012 --> 00:17:39.680
- Thank you.
- Thanks again, Willie.

347
00:17:39.764 --> 00:17:41.557
Alright, you're welcome.

348
00:17:41.641 --> 00:17:43.099
- See you guys later.
- Thanks.

349
00:17:43.183 --> 00:17:44.392
Alright.

350
00:18:02.907 --> 00:18:06.493
- Okay, we're ready to go.
- Cool.

351
00:18:06.576 --> 00:18:08.453
I guess I'll start off
by asking

352
00:18:08.536 --> 00:18:11.038
what do you think is going on here at Mount Adams?

353
00:18:11.121 --> 00:18:13.374
Well, I'll tell you;
demonic activity,

354
00:18:13.457 --> 00:18:14.500
plain and simple.

355
00:18:14.583 --> 00:18:16.501
Care to explain
what you mean by that?

356
00:18:16.584 --> 00:18:19.128
I don't expect you all
to understand completely,

357
00:18:19.212 --> 00:18:21.338
but I do know somethin'
that'll help you understand

358
00:18:21.421 --> 00:18:22.631
a little bit more.

359
00:18:28.469 --> 00:18:31.054
"And I beheld another beast
coming up out of the earth,

360
00:18:31.137 --> 00:18:33.139
and he had two horns
like a lamb,

361
00:18:33.223 --> 00:18:37.184
and he spake as a dragon,
and he exerciseth all the power

362
00:18:37.267 --> 00:18:40.895
of the first beast before him
and causes the earth and them,

363
00:18:40.979 --> 00:18:43.523
which dwell therein
to worship the first beast,

364
00:18:43.606 --> 00:18:45.524
whose deadly wound was healed.

365
00:18:45.607 --> 00:18:46.817
And he doeth great wonders

366
00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:50.069
so that he maketh fire come down
from heaven on the earth

367
00:18:50.152 --> 00:18:51.529
in the sight of men."

368
00:18:53.531 --> 00:18:55.782
Now, do you understand
what I'm talking about?

369
00:18:55.865 --> 00:18:58.076
You mean the demons
are the monsters

370
00:18:58.159 --> 00:19:00.828
people see on the mountains
and the fire from heaven

371
00:19:00.911 --> 00:19:02.162
is supposed to be
the red lights?

372
00:19:02.246 --> 00:19:04.622
Yes, yes, you understand.

373
00:19:04.706 --> 00:19:06.749
Oh, and I've got another verse.

374
00:19:06.833 --> 00:19:09.543
Ephesians 6:12.

375
00:19:15.006 --> 00:19:17.258
"For we wrestle not
against flesh and blood

376
00:19:17.341 --> 00:19:19.968
but against principalities,
against powers,

377
00:19:20.051 --> 00:19:22.554
against the rulers
of the darkness of this world,

378
00:19:22.637 --> 00:19:26.181
against spiritual wickedness
in high places."

379
00:19:26.265 --> 00:19:28.683
Now, you can't tell me that
there's not a spiritual battle

380
00:19:28.766 --> 00:19:30.184
goin' on up there.

381
00:19:31.728 --> 00:19:34.563
Now, you said on the phone
that your daughter saw

382
00:19:34.646 --> 00:19:36.815
the creatures, too.

383
00:19:36.898 --> 00:19:39.775
They were demons.

384
00:19:39.859 --> 00:19:41.152
We saw three of them out there,

385
00:19:41.235 --> 00:19:45.155
just off of our tree sightline
and... and the sun had just set,

386
00:19:45.238 --> 00:19:46.822
and I know that
they were demons.

387
00:19:46.905 --> 00:19:50.159
They had red glowing eyes
straight from hell.

388
00:19:50.242 --> 00:19:52.618
Is it alright if...
if we talk with her?

389
00:19:52.702 --> 00:19:53.745
DEBBIE:
With Ruby?

390
00:19:53.828 --> 00:19:56.372
Yes, she's outside taking care
of the animals.

391
00:19:56.455 --> 00:19:57.539
Come on.

392
00:20:00.792 --> 00:20:02.668
Hey guys, you must be
the demon hunter people.

393
00:20:02.752 --> 00:20:04.295
- Mmhmm.
- I'm Blake.

394
00:20:04.378 --> 00:20:05.671
Hey, I'm Glen.

395
00:20:05.755 --> 00:20:07.130
Hey, Lily.

396
00:20:07.213 --> 00:20:09.758
So um, your mom told us
that you saw the creatures.

397
00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:11.884
Like could you tell us exactly
what you saw?

398
00:20:11.967 --> 00:20:12.509
RUBY:
Yeah, sure.

399
00:20:12.593 --> 00:20:14.178
It was right out there.

400
00:20:14.261 --> 00:20:17.180
Uh, there were three of them,
running along the edge.

401
00:20:17.263 --> 00:20:18.765
These things were huge,
had red eyes.

402
00:20:18.848 --> 00:20:20.474
That's all I really remember.

403
00:20:20.557 --> 00:20:22.976
Ruby, is that the only time
you've seen the creatures?

404
00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.519
I wish it was, but no.

405
00:20:24.603 --> 00:20:26.103
They'd usually come around here

406
00:20:26.187 --> 00:20:29.106
when the red lights
would go off on the mountain.

407
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:31.232
When... when was the last time
you saw them?

408
00:20:31.316 --> 00:20:33.985
About a year ago
was the last time I saw them.

409
00:20:34.069 --> 00:20:35.235
I mean uh, they...
they must have done

410
00:20:35.319 --> 00:20:36.445
somethin' up on the mountain,

411
00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:38.864
'cause they were bringin'
trucks up there, bulldozers,

412
00:20:38.947 --> 00:20:40.323
they were haulin' everything
up there.

413
00:20:40.406 --> 00:20:41.532
I mean you still see
the red lights,

414
00:20:41.616 --> 00:20:44.493
but whatever they are,
don't come around here anymore.

415
00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:45.452
Oh, right.

416
00:20:45.535 --> 00:20:46.495
Yeah, uh, we...
we've gotta get back,

417
00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:48.163
I'm... I'm sorry, but hey,
thank you so much

418
00:20:48.246 --> 00:20:49.288
- for letting us interview you.
- Oh.

419
00:20:49.371 --> 00:20:50.372
- Thank you, Ruby.
- Thanks.

420
00:20:50.456 --> 00:20:51.415
- No problem.
- Thank you, nice to meet you.

421
00:20:51.499 --> 00:20:52.291
And good luck in
whatever it is you're doin'.

422
00:20:52.374 --> 00:20:53.000
Nice to meet you.

423
00:20:53.084 --> 00:20:54.250
Thanks.

424
00:21:05.635 --> 00:21:07.553
(Door opens)

425
00:21:07.637 --> 00:21:08.595
Oh, hey!

426
00:21:08.678 --> 00:21:09.346
How'd it go?

427
00:21:09.429 --> 00:21:09.971
LILY:
Pretty well.

428
00:21:10.055 --> 00:21:10.931
- Good.
- Yeah.

429
00:21:11.014 --> 00:21:12.099
I thought it went good.

430
00:21:12.182 --> 00:21:13.100
Hey, I got a free beer.

431
00:21:13.182 --> 00:21:14.183
Everything good here?

432
00:21:14.266 --> 00:21:16.185
Yeah, Kim and Thomas should be
ready to go...

433
00:21:16.268 --> 00:21:17.770
(Kim screaming)

434
00:21:17.853 --> 00:21:23.273
(♪♪♪)

435
00:21:23.357 --> 00:21:24.108
Are you guys alright?

436
00:21:24.191 --> 00:21:25.150
(Screaming)

437
00:21:25.234 --> 00:21:27.111
Oh, uh...

438
00:21:27.194 --> 00:21:28.236
Welcome back.

439
00:21:28.319 --> 00:21:29.487
Surprise.

440
00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:30.446
Come on, really you guys?

441
00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:31.656
You should know better.

442
00:21:31.739 --> 00:21:32.864
Uh, surprise.

443
00:21:32.948 --> 00:21:34.282
Surprise what?

444
00:21:34.366 --> 00:21:35.575
That over there.

445
00:21:36.952 --> 00:21:38.661
- (Gasping)
- (Chuckling)

446
00:21:42.205 --> 00:21:43.998
You can't stay mad at me
forever.

447
00:21:44.082 --> 00:21:45.875
Yeah, Lily, forgiveness
is the key to moving on

448
00:21:45.959 --> 00:21:46.875
with your life.

449
00:21:46.959 --> 00:21:47.793
How true.

450
00:21:47.876 --> 00:21:49.253
We forgave you for being
a piece of...

451
00:21:49.336 --> 00:21:51.338
Okay, you guys are really
getting on my nerves.

452
00:21:51.421 --> 00:21:53.047
Uh-oh, somebody has nerves.

453
00:21:53.131 --> 00:21:54.590
Oh, the nerve of some people.

454
00:21:54.674 --> 00:21:55.716
Seriously, you guys?

455
00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.300
(Laughing)

456
00:21:57.384 --> 00:21:58.552
Hey, we're here.

457
00:21:58.635 --> 00:21:59.719
I noticed.

458
00:21:59.803 --> 00:22:02.930
(Birds chirping)

459
00:22:03.013 --> 00:22:06.015
(Vehicle whirring)

460
00:22:25.239 --> 00:22:27.616
Hi, I'm uh,
Chief Ranger Bill Jefferson.

461
00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:28.993
- Glen, right?
- Yep.

462
00:22:29.076 --> 00:22:30.827
We spoke to each other
on the phone?

463
00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:32.245
- Yeah, that's me.
- Lily.

464
00:22:32.328 --> 00:22:33.329
(Chuckles)

465
00:22:33.413 --> 00:22:36.331
This is uh, it's Blake,
camera guy and tech.

466
00:22:36.415 --> 00:22:38.375
- And uh, that's Candie.
- Hi.

467
00:22:38.458 --> 00:22:41.586
And uh, Thomas and Kim,
they're the assistants.

468
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:43.087
Well, pleased to meet you all.

469
00:22:43.171 --> 00:22:44.629
(Sighing)

470
00:22:44.713 --> 00:22:48.049
So um, how about we get up
on that mountain?

471
00:22:48.133 --> 00:22:48.884
- Yeah.
- Yeah,

472
00:22:48.967 --> 00:22:50.467
we'll follow you on
up there.

473
00:22:50.551 --> 00:22:51.802
Sounds good.

474
00:22:51.886 --> 00:23:01.894
(♪♪♪)

475
00:23:31.918 --> 00:23:41.925
(♪♪♪)

476
00:24:15.785 --> 00:24:17.036
(Grunts)

477
00:24:27.503 --> 00:24:30.213
So uh, you know,
this is the uh closed-off trail

478
00:24:30.296 --> 00:24:31.881
that leads up around
the mountain

479
00:24:31.965 --> 00:24:33.341
eventually to the top.

480
00:24:33.424 --> 00:24:36.343
Believe this is the trail
you mentioned on the phone.

481
00:24:36.426 --> 00:24:38.053
Well, how are we supposed
to get up there

482
00:24:38.136 --> 00:24:39.054
if it's blocked off?

483
00:24:39.137 --> 00:24:40.388
You won't.

484
00:24:40.471 --> 00:24:41.597
Nobody's allowed up there.

485
00:24:41.681 --> 00:24:43.599
Uh, too many people
went missin',

486
00:24:43.683 --> 00:24:46.142
so four years ago
we decided to start closin'

487
00:24:46.226 --> 00:24:48.853
all the trails
that lead to the top.

488
00:24:48.936 --> 00:24:50.771
Are there any trails
that are still open?

489
00:24:50.854 --> 00:24:52.898
Only the ones around the base
of the mountain.

490
00:24:52.982 --> 00:24:54.649
(Sighing)

491
00:24:55.608 --> 00:24:57.360
I'll be right back.

492
00:24:57.443 --> 00:24:59.569
I thought you talked to him
about this.

493
00:24:59.653 --> 00:25:00.737
I did talk to the guy
about this.

494
00:25:00.821 --> 00:25:01.989
(Sighing)

495
00:25:07.285 --> 00:25:08.493
I can't believe
we came all the way out here

496
00:25:08.576 --> 00:25:10.078
- for this.
- It's okay.

497
00:25:10.161 --> 00:25:11.913
How much money do we have?

498
00:25:11.997 --> 00:25:15.541
You're not thinking about
bribing a forest ranger?

499
00:25:15.624 --> 00:25:16.208
Trust me.

500
00:25:16.292 --> 00:25:17.584
How much do we have?

501
00:25:17.668 --> 00:25:21.796
Um, I think about 500.

502
00:25:23.672 --> 00:25:24.715
Yeah, 500.

503
00:25:24.798 --> 00:25:26.675
I can't believe you brought
that much money.

504
00:25:26.758 --> 00:25:29.677
Well, I wanted to be prepared
in case we had an emergency.

505
00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.095
Well, this counts
as an emergency.

506
00:25:32.178 --> 00:25:33.054
Yeah, I suppose.

507
00:25:33.138 --> 00:25:34.723
(Sighing)

508
00:25:37.349 --> 00:25:38.475
This is the part
where she flashes him

509
00:25:38.559 --> 00:25:40.102
and he lets us go up there.

510
00:25:40.185 --> 00:25:41.437
(Scoffs)

511
00:25:45.857 --> 00:25:49.568
Hey, if you're willing to be
our guide on the trail,

512
00:25:49.651 --> 00:25:52.611
I'll give you $300 cash
right now.

513
00:25:53.904 --> 00:25:58.033
Um, look, if you...
you wanna pay for a tour guide

514
00:25:58.116 --> 00:26:00.493
to take you up there,
I can do that,

515
00:26:00.577 --> 00:26:02.453
but it'll cost you.

516
00:26:02.536 --> 00:26:03.537
400.

517
00:26:06.164 --> 00:26:07.290
Works for me.

518
00:26:07.373 --> 00:26:16.380
(♪♪♪)

519
00:26:16.464 --> 00:26:18.049
Works for me.

520
00:26:18.132 --> 00:26:20.050
I'll go grab my stuff
and we'll get goin'.

521
00:26:20.133 --> 00:26:22.052
Cool. Give us five minutes
to get ready.

522
00:26:22.135 --> 00:26:32.143
(♪♪♪)

523
00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:36.480
No, it's not safe.

524
00:26:36.563 --> 00:26:38.231
Look, you don't have to go.

525
00:26:38.315 --> 00:26:39.857
Nobody's forcin' you.

526
00:26:43.486 --> 00:26:44.819
Everything alright?

527
00:26:47.155 --> 00:26:51.450
Look, I'm sorry, I can't go.

528
00:26:51.533 --> 00:26:54.827
I thought we just stayin'
on the side of the road.

529
00:26:54.911 --> 00:26:56.537
It's not a smart idea to be
up there

530
00:26:56.621 --> 00:26:58.914
if the light do come tonight.

531
00:26:58.997 --> 00:27:00.582
Well, but we...
we have to go up there,

532
00:27:00.665 --> 00:27:01.958
there's no clear shots
down here.

533
00:27:02.042 --> 00:27:04.251
We have to...
we have to film the lights.

534
00:27:04.335 --> 00:27:06.003
I know.

535
00:27:06.087 --> 00:27:07.380
I know but...

536
00:27:08.755 --> 00:27:10.673
Here, give me a radio,

537
00:27:10.757 --> 00:27:13.175
so I can stay in contact
with you.

538
00:27:13.258 --> 00:27:14.385
Here.

539
00:27:14.468 --> 00:27:16.804
Well, we'll give you a call
if anything goes wrong.

540
00:27:18.388 --> 00:27:19.472
Okay.

541
00:27:23.183 --> 00:27:24.601
Stay safe, okay?

542
00:27:24.684 --> 00:27:26.186
I will.

543
00:27:26.269 --> 00:27:28.312
Hey Bill, give me your keys.

544
00:27:28.396 --> 00:27:30.314
I'll drive the truck back
to the station.

545
00:27:30.398 --> 00:27:32.399
I'll come pick you up
when you're ready.

546
00:27:32.482 --> 00:27:33.817
Alright.

547
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:35.276
(Grunts)

548
00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:45.368
(♪♪♪)

549
00:28:21.563 --> 00:28:23.565
I'm afraid
I'm gonna want my money back.

550
00:28:23.648 --> 00:28:24.649
Oh, no, no...

551
00:28:24.731 --> 00:28:25.566
Everything's fine.

552
00:28:25.649 --> 00:28:28.902
We just need to take a shortcut.

553
00:28:28.986 --> 00:28:30.194
Did he say "shortcut"?

554
00:28:30.278 --> 00:28:32.655
Are you absolutely sure
you know what you're doing?

555
00:28:32.738 --> 00:28:34.990
I mean have you ever even been
on this path?

556
00:28:35.073 --> 00:28:36.825
No, not exactly.

557
00:28:36.908 --> 00:28:39.869
I'm familiar with the map,
I do know where we're going.

558
00:28:39.952 --> 00:28:42.872
We'll just go on
through up here

559
00:28:42.955 --> 00:28:46.332
and uh,
it'll take us to the top.

560
00:28:46.416 --> 00:28:47.709
I promise.

561
00:28:47.792 --> 00:28:48.959
You better be right.

562
00:28:49.042 --> 00:28:59.134
(♪♪♪)

563
00:28:59.217 --> 00:29:00.260
A word?

564
00:29:03.762 --> 00:29:04.847
What's up?

565
00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:07.349
Look, I... I don't think
it's a good idea to...

566
00:29:07.433 --> 00:29:10.101
Blake, it's not gonna kill us
to go off the trail, okay?

567
00:29:10.185 --> 00:29:11.227
It's fine.
As long as Bill knows

568
00:29:11.311 --> 00:29:13.312
what he's doing, it'll be okay.

569
00:29:13.395 --> 00:29:14.146
THOMAS:
Seriously?

570
00:29:14.229 --> 00:29:15.439
I could eat a bowl
of alphabet soup

571
00:29:15.522 --> 00:29:17.440
and crap out a statement
smarter than that.

572
00:29:17.523 --> 00:29:20.026
Look, all Ranger Turd-face
is gonna do is get us lost,

573
00:29:20.109 --> 00:29:22.028
so he can get the $400
for a blow-up doll.

574
00:29:22.111 --> 00:29:25.989
Look, I know what I'm doin',
alright?

575
00:29:26.072 --> 00:29:27.281
I've been
a chief forest ranger

576
00:29:27.364 --> 00:29:28.282
for 10 years.

577
00:29:28.365 --> 00:29:29.492
So why don't you just shut
the hell up

578
00:29:29.575 --> 00:29:31.660
- and let me do my job?
- Keep talkin'.

579
00:29:31.744 --> 00:29:34.954
Maybe someday you'll say
something intelligent.

580
00:29:35.038 --> 00:29:36.830
Hey guys, uh,
we're losing daylight,

581
00:29:36.914 --> 00:29:37.456
we need to move.

582
00:29:37.539 --> 00:29:38.916
Whatever.

583
00:29:58.765 --> 00:29:59.849
(Taking deep breaths)

584
00:29:59.933 --> 00:30:00.807
I'm sorry, I um...

585
00:30:00.891 --> 00:30:01.767
(Takes a deep breath)

586
00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:03.519
Just need to take a quick rest.

587
00:30:03.602 --> 00:30:04.811
Oh, I'll tell them to wait up.

588
00:30:04.895 --> 00:30:06.145
Oh, no, that's okay.

589
00:30:06.229 --> 00:30:09.774
Um, yeah, I can still see 'em,
so we can catch up.

590
00:30:10.899 --> 00:30:13.735
(Taking deep breaths)

591
00:30:13.818 --> 00:30:15.736
Are we really going all the way
to the top?

592
00:30:15.819 --> 00:30:16.987
Well, yes.

593
00:30:17.071 --> 00:30:18.781
Isn't this the romantic getaway
in the heart of nature

594
00:30:18.864 --> 00:30:19.906
that you always wanted?

595
00:30:19.989 --> 00:30:21.449
CANDIE:
Not exactly.

596
00:30:21.533 --> 00:30:22.784
Though, everywhere with you
always turns

597
00:30:22.867 --> 00:30:24.743
into a romantic getaway, so...

598
00:30:24.826 --> 00:30:26.245
(Laughing)

599
00:30:27.913 --> 00:30:29.705
I'll make it even more romantic
when we get to the top.

600
00:30:29.789 --> 00:30:30.998
Oh, I'm sure you will.

601
00:30:31.082 --> 00:30:31.791
(Chuckling)

602
00:30:31.874 --> 00:30:33.292
Here, hand me my backpack.

603
00:30:38.129 --> 00:30:39.880
Okay, let's...
let's get out of here.

604
00:30:39.964 --> 00:30:49.972
(♪♪♪)

605
00:30:57.228 --> 00:30:57.770
(Exclaims)

606
00:30:57.853 --> 00:30:59.020
Blake.

607
00:31:04.191 --> 00:31:05.985
(Yelling)

608
00:31:06.068 --> 00:31:06.819
Really?

609
00:31:06.902 --> 00:31:08.069
You guys.

610
00:31:08.152 --> 00:31:09.529
Glen told us to come back
and check on you.

611
00:31:09.612 --> 00:31:10.947
We're all waiting for you.

612
00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:12.240
Looks like
they're alright to me.

613
00:31:12.323 --> 00:31:13.198
Mission accomplished.

614
00:31:13.282 --> 00:31:14.992
- (Chuckling)
- Yep.

615
00:31:15.075 --> 00:31:16.410
I'm gonna kill you guys.

616
00:31:16.493 --> 00:31:17.660
Good luck with that.

617
00:31:17.743 --> 00:31:27.751
(♪♪♪)

618
00:31:29.837 --> 00:31:31.005
So how much further?

619
00:31:31.088 --> 00:31:32.589
Well, not much.

620
00:31:32.672 --> 00:31:35.383
I suggest we uh,
set up camp here.

621
00:31:35.466 --> 00:31:37.259
It's not much farther up
to the top.

622
00:31:37.342 --> 00:31:39.678
Okay, that sounds great to me.

623
00:31:39.761 --> 00:31:42.430
Blake, can you set up camp,
so uh, Glen and I can set up

624
00:31:42.513 --> 00:31:44.098
some cameras on the trees
around here?

625
00:31:44.181 --> 00:31:45.182
Yeah, no problem.

626
00:31:45.266 --> 00:31:47.517
Hey, Thomas, Kim,
could you help him out?

627
00:31:47.601 --> 00:31:48.518
- KIM: Yeah, sure.
- THOMAS: Sure.

628
00:31:48.602 --> 00:31:49.728
Thanks.

629
00:31:54.398 --> 00:31:55.482
Hey, how about right here?

630
00:31:55.566 --> 00:31:57.567
That way we can see
if anything comes close to camp.

631
00:31:57.650 --> 00:31:59.068
Oh, yeah, that'll work.

632
00:32:12.495 --> 00:32:13.246
There we go.

633
00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:15.122
Okay.

634
00:32:17.082 --> 00:32:19.084
(Taking deep breaths)

635
00:32:19.168 --> 00:32:27.090
You know, the lights
are probably just airplanes.

636
00:32:27.174 --> 00:32:28.884
Stop being such a pessimist.

637
00:32:28.967 --> 00:32:29.842
No, I'm being serious.

638
00:32:29.925 --> 00:32:33.929
Like I mean
do you honestly think that

639
00:32:34.013 --> 00:32:36.139
there's demons and aliens
up here?

640
00:32:36.222 --> 00:32:39.642
I mean not really, but I think
anything's possible.

641
00:32:39.725 --> 00:32:41.894
Well, I don't know.

642
00:32:41.977 --> 00:32:44.145
I think some things
are more possible than others.

643
00:32:52.152 --> 00:32:56.197
Okay, I got just one left.

644
00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.406
Oh, yes.

645
00:32:57.490 --> 00:32:58.156
Uh.

646
00:32:58.239 --> 00:32:59.074
Where do you want this one?

647
00:32:59.157 --> 00:32:59.991
Down that way.

648
00:33:00.075 --> 00:33:01.868
Alright, cool.

649
00:33:06.205 --> 00:33:07.539
(Grunting)

650
00:33:07.622 --> 00:33:17.630
(♪♪♪)

651
00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:34.560
No, no, you're shitting it
all up!

652
00:33:34.644 --> 00:33:36.520
Why don't you watch
your language, you little turd.

653
00:33:36.603 --> 00:33:38.355
Let me tell you about
a porcupine's balls.

654
00:33:38.438 --> 00:33:40.190
They're small
and they don't give a crap.

655
00:33:40.273 --> 00:33:41.440
Why don't you grow up?

656
00:33:41.524 --> 00:33:43.275
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
come on now, guys!

657
00:33:45.194 --> 00:33:47.237
Blake, do you have
all the camera stuff?

658
00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.072
We need to head up
before it gets too dark.

659
00:33:49.155 --> 00:33:50.532
Yeah, I'm all ready to go.

660
00:33:50.615 --> 00:33:51.532
Candie, do you have your shoes?

661
00:33:51.615 --> 00:33:52.783
Uh, they're right here,
I'll put 'em on.

662
00:33:52.866 --> 00:33:53.867
BLAKE:
Alright.

663
00:33:55.702 --> 00:33:57.078
Hey, Bill, you comin'?

664
00:33:57.161 --> 00:33:58.454
No, I'm good.

665
00:33:58.538 --> 00:34:00.539
You let me know
if you see anything, huh?

666
00:34:00.622 --> 00:34:02.124
Will do.

667
00:34:10.587 --> 00:34:13.216
Onward to battle
with the aliens!

668
00:34:13.299 --> 00:34:23.306
(♪♪♪)

669
00:35:05.674 --> 00:35:09.677
I'll now name this giant piece
of dirt "Titty Top Mountain".

670
00:35:14.097 --> 00:35:24.147
(♪♪♪)

671
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:25.732
I'll set the camera up.

672
00:35:29.193 --> 00:35:30.903
Hey, look down there.

673
00:35:36.656 --> 00:35:38.992
Oh my God, are you filming?

674
00:35:39.075 --> 00:35:40.619
Yeah, I'm getting this.

675
00:35:40.702 --> 00:35:50.709
(♪♪♪)

676
00:36:04.721 --> 00:36:06.138
(Indistinct chatter)

677
00:36:06.222 --> 00:36:07.848
I can't believe it's on camera.

678
00:36:07.932 --> 00:36:09.558
I know.

679
00:36:09.642 --> 00:36:11.643
Oh my God, that footage
is gonna be amazing,

680
00:36:11.726 --> 00:36:12.644
I cannot wait to see it.

681
00:36:12.727 --> 00:36:14.145
We're gonna sell a lot of DVDs.

682
00:36:14.229 --> 00:36:15.854
I know, I'm so excited.

683
00:36:15.938 --> 00:36:16.980
(Chuckling)

684
00:36:17.064 --> 00:36:18.732
(Overlapping conversation)

685
00:36:18.816 --> 00:36:21.818
(Taking deep breaths)

686
00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.072
This is Bill's.

687
00:36:27.155 --> 00:36:30.324
(Taking deep breaths)

688
00:36:30.407 --> 00:36:32.201
Hey, Bill?

689
00:36:32.284 --> 00:36:33.661
Hey, Bill?

690
00:36:35.203 --> 00:36:37.330
Why would he go walking
in the mud?

691
00:36:37.413 --> 00:36:39.331
- (Gasping)
- KIM: Oh my God!

692
00:36:41.792 --> 00:36:43.376
That's blood.

693
00:36:43.459 --> 00:36:45.962
I'm calling 911.

694
00:36:46.045 --> 00:36:47.839
You guys,
I don't have any service.

695
00:36:49.965 --> 00:36:51.633
Lily, do you...
do you have the radio?

696
00:36:51.716 --> 00:36:52.551
Yeah.

697
00:36:52.634 --> 00:36:53.926
I mean we...
we should call Willie.

698
00:36:54.009 --> 00:36:55.553
- Here.
- Have him call the police.

699
00:36:55.636 --> 00:36:58.429
Oh my God.

700
00:36:58.513 --> 00:36:59.597
Okay.

701
00:37:01.933 --> 00:37:03.141
(Sniffling)

702
00:37:07.104 --> 00:37:08.479
Willie, can you hear me?

703
00:37:08.563 --> 00:37:09.897
This is Glen.

704
00:37:11.023 --> 00:37:12.607
WILLIE: (On radio)Hello?

705
00:37:12.691 --> 00:37:15.110

Willie, this is Glen.

710
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:21.615
Can you hear me?

711
00:37:21.699 --> 00:37:23.616
We... we can't find Bill.

712
00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:25.118
WILLIE: (On radio)Hello?

713
00:37:29.621 --> 00:37:31.330
(Sniffling)

714
00:37:31.414 --> 00:37:32.498
Okay.

715
00:37:32.582 --> 00:37:35.084
Alright, guys, we ne...
we need to go look for him.

716
00:37:35.167 --> 00:37:37.544
Well, you guys are the adults,
figure it out.

717
00:37:37.627 --> 00:37:39.421
Good luck and good night.

718
00:37:39.504 --> 00:37:41.088
Honestly, that's not a bad idea.

719
00:37:41.171 --> 00:37:43.549
We're not gonna find him
at this time of night, anyway.

720
00:37:43.632 --> 00:37:45.050
Yeah, I agree.

721
00:37:45.134 --> 00:37:47.135
Yeah, sounds good.

722
00:37:47.218 --> 00:37:48.136
Alright.

723
00:37:48.219 --> 00:37:49.470
Fine, we'll... we'll...
we'll look for him

724
00:37:49.554 --> 00:37:50.888
in the morning.

725
00:37:51.889 --> 00:37:53.765
(Sighing)

726
00:37:54.975 --> 00:37:59.437
(Indistinct speech)

727
00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:09.528
(♪♪♪)

728
00:38:16.366 --> 00:38:18.160
There you go.

729
00:38:21.746 --> 00:38:25.624
So how much longer
do we have to uh, look for Bill?

730
00:38:25.707 --> 00:38:26.917
I'm not sure.

731
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.418
We'll never find him,
'cause he's probably out stealing

732
00:38:28.501 --> 00:38:29.835
our cars I bet.

733
00:38:29.919 --> 00:38:31.462
Thomas, that's not funny.

734
00:38:31.545 --> 00:38:33.130
He's probably really hurt.

735
00:38:38.259 --> 00:38:39.635
I'm gonna go look for him.

736
00:38:39.718 --> 00:38:41.011
You wanna come?

737
00:38:41.094 --> 00:38:42.262
Yeah, sure.

738
00:38:54.104 --> 00:38:55.731
GLEN:
Hey, Bill!

739
00:39:01.819 --> 00:39:04.279
Hey, Bill!

740
00:39:04.363 --> 00:39:06.073
Bill!

741
00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.331
You know, we're dead
if we don't find him.

742
00:39:16.414 --> 00:39:17.873
Well, thanks for being positive.

743
00:39:17.957 --> 00:39:18.874
No, seriously.

744
00:39:18.958 --> 00:39:20.167
He's the only one
who knows his way back

745
00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:21.418
to the trail.

746
00:39:21.502 --> 00:39:22.961
Oh, I'm...
I'm sure we'll be fine,

747
00:39:23.044 --> 00:39:24.629
we'll find him.

748
00:39:24.712 --> 00:39:26.381
Oh, hold up,
I gotta water the trees.

749
00:39:26.463 --> 00:39:27.631
Alright.

750
00:39:32.301 --> 00:39:35.304
(Flies buzzing)

751
00:39:41.976 --> 00:39:43.143
Oh!

752
00:39:43.227 --> 00:39:43.769
Glen!

753
00:39:43.852 --> 00:39:44.937
Glen, come over here!

754
00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:46.312
I think I found something,
you need to see this!

755
00:39:52.818 --> 00:39:53.568
He's dead.

756
00:39:53.652 --> 00:39:55.112
Yeah, that... that's him.

757
00:39:55.194 --> 00:39:56.529
We... we gotta tell 'em.

758
00:39:56.612 --> 00:39:57.697
We gotta tell 'em.

759
00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.490
No, no, wait, wait!
Thomas, wait!

760
00:39:59.573 --> 00:40:09.789
(♪♪♪)

761
00:40:09.872 --> 00:40:10.790
He's dead!

762
00:40:10.873 --> 00:40:11.708
He's dead!

763
00:40:11.791 --> 00:40:13.751
- What?
- What?

764
00:40:13.835 --> 00:40:16.253
(Taking deep breaths)

765
00:40:16.336 --> 00:40:18.547
We found him.

766
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:20.381
It looked like an animal attack
to me.

767
00:40:23.134 --> 00:40:25.677
Oh my gosh.

768
00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:29.221
So what... what do we do now?

769
00:40:29.304 --> 00:40:31.849
I think we should pack up
and head back down.

770
00:40:31.932 --> 00:40:34.058
But Bill was the only one
who knew how to get back.

771
00:40:34.142 --> 00:40:35.643
We don't have a choice Kim,
okay?

772
00:40:35.727 --> 00:40:39.813
This is a closed-off zone,
nobody comes up here.

773
00:40:39.896 --> 00:40:41.023
She's... she's right.

774
00:40:41.106 --> 00:40:42.357
If we're gonna try today
we need to leave

775
00:40:42.441 --> 00:40:43.899
as soon as we can.

776
00:40:43.983 --> 00:40:45.067
Okay.

777
00:40:45.151 --> 00:40:55.159
(♪♪♪)

778
00:41:13.506 --> 00:41:14.966
Are you okay?
We can take a break.

779
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:16.717
I'm fine, sort of.

780
00:41:23.765 --> 00:41:25.058
(Sighing)

781
00:41:26.808 --> 00:41:28.393
Ow!

782
00:41:28.477 --> 00:41:29.352
What the hell was that?

783
00:41:29.436 --> 00:41:31.729
It looked like a bug!

784
00:41:31.812 --> 00:41:32.646
Wait, did you get stung?

785
00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:34.148
Sure feels like I did.

786
00:41:34.231 --> 00:41:45.074
(♪♪♪)

787
00:41:45.157 --> 00:41:46.991
BLAKE:
Hey guys, I found it.

788
00:41:52.996 --> 00:41:53.914
Blake, be careful

789
00:41:53.997 --> 00:41:55.372
I don't know
if we brought your EpiPen.

790
00:41:59.834 --> 00:42:02.087
Oh dang, that thing's nasty!

791
00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:02.796
LILY:
Let me look.

792
00:42:02.879 --> 00:42:05.589
CANDIE:
Be careful!

793
00:42:05.672 --> 00:42:07.007
Oh, mm.

794
00:42:07.091 --> 00:42:08.008
Get me a stick,
I wanna make sure

795
00:42:08.092 --> 00:42:10.218
it doesn't hurt anybody.

796
00:42:10.301 --> 00:42:12.804
Thomas lines up his bat
and focuses on the target.

797
00:42:12.887 --> 00:42:15.472
Look at that concentration
as he's getting ready.

798
00:42:15.555 --> 00:42:16.890
And he scores!

799
00:42:16.973 --> 00:42:19.183
Oh, that was disgusting.

800
00:42:24.395 --> 00:42:26.022
Everything going okay?

801
00:42:26.106 --> 00:42:28.525
Yeah, as far as I can tell.

802
00:42:28.607 --> 00:42:29.942
Does it feel any better?

803
00:42:30.025 --> 00:42:31.401
Uh, yeah, sort of.

804
00:42:31.485 --> 00:42:33.653
- You think you can walk?
- I can.

805
00:42:33.736 --> 00:42:36.114
It doesn't hurt that bad,
it just really stings.

806
00:42:36.197 --> 00:42:37.073
Okay.

807
00:42:37.156 --> 00:42:39.074
- (Sighing)
- Here, let me help.

808
00:42:42.661 --> 00:42:45.454
Thomas, get your backpack,
break's over.

809
00:42:57.964 --> 00:43:07.972
(♪♪♪)

810
00:43:24.569 --> 00:43:27.028
Lily, where's the trail?

811
00:43:27.112 --> 00:43:28.613
We've been walking all day.

812
00:43:30.282 --> 00:43:31.407
I don't know.

813
00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:32.449
What do you mean you don't know?

814
00:43:32.533 --> 00:43:34.577
It means I don't know.

815
00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:37.662
- Candie, we're lost.
- Don't... don't say we're lost.

816
00:43:37.745 --> 00:43:47.753
(♪♪♪)

817
00:43:50.505 --> 00:43:52.382
We should probably find a place
to set up camp.

818
00:43:52.465 --> 00:43:53.675
I know.

819
00:44:00.763 --> 00:44:05.225
You know, we've still got
plenty of food, we've got water,

820
00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:10.313
we've got tents, sleeping bags,
I mean we'll be alright.

821
00:44:10.396 --> 00:44:11.397
Alright.

822
00:44:13.399 --> 00:44:15.859
I'll get a fire going,
that'll make you feel better.

823
00:44:15.942 --> 00:44:25.950
(♪♪♪)

824
00:44:45.424 --> 00:44:46.967
So since we're on the topic
of farms,

825
00:44:47.051 --> 00:44:48.718
I kinda had a question.

826
00:44:48.801 --> 00:44:51.262
If a cow laughed like really,
really hard

827
00:44:51.346 --> 00:44:52.679
would milk come out
of its nose?

828
00:44:52.763 --> 00:44:54.139
(Chuckling)

829
00:44:54.223 --> 00:44:54.973
What?

830
00:44:55.057 --> 00:44:56.433
I thought it made sense.

831
00:44:56.516 --> 00:44:58.601
Hey, I lived on a farm
and I can tell you

832
00:44:58.684 --> 00:44:59.685
that would never happen.

833
00:44:59.769 --> 00:45:00.895
(Chuckling)

834
00:45:00.978 --> 00:45:02.854
I visited a farm
for a school trip once

835
00:45:02.938 --> 00:45:04.439
and the teacher asked
the farmer,

836
00:45:04.522 --> 00:45:06.483
"So what's your favorite part
about bein' a farmer?"

837
00:45:06.566 --> 00:45:09.276
He says, "Gettin' down dirty
with all my hoes."

838
00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:10.653
CANDIE:
Oh my God.

839
00:45:10.736 --> 00:45:12.153
(Chuckles)

840
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:18.575
Well, I think I'm ready
to hit the hay.

841
00:45:18.659 --> 00:45:19.493
No pun intended.

842
00:45:19.576 --> 00:45:21.786
(Chuckling)

843
00:45:21.869 --> 00:45:23.120
Same here.

844
00:45:23.204 --> 00:45:24.121
Me, too.

845
00:45:24.205 --> 00:45:25.998
Oh, how's your leg doin'?

846
00:45:26.081 --> 00:45:27.040
It's okay.

847
00:45:27.123 --> 00:45:28.750
Thanks for asking.

848
00:45:28.833 --> 00:45:30.960
Don't worry,
I killed that little sucker.

849
00:45:31.043 --> 00:45:32.878
Uh, believe me
it wasn't little.

850
00:45:32.962 --> 00:45:33.629
That was one...

851
00:45:33.712 --> 00:45:34.588
Oh!

Did... did we stay here
all night?

875
00:48:26.557 --> 00:48:28.475
Yeah.

876
00:48:28.558 --> 00:48:31.061
Guys, I had a really bad dream.

877
00:48:31.144 --> 00:48:33.687
Blake was talking about
something and then...

878
00:48:33.771 --> 00:48:35.106
That wasn't a dream.

Blake and Candie.

880
00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:51.619
Guys, um, we're not gonna be
able to carry all this out.

881
00:48:52.911 --> 00:48:56.957
We need to sort out and bring
only the essential things.

There's nothing
I can do about it.

Hey, Glen, her leg's looking
really bad.

887
00:49:53.751 --> 00:49:55.002
You need to fix it.

888
00:49:57.129 --> 00:49:58.338
Let's see.

889
00:50:02.467 --> 00:50:05.469
Y... yeah, that's... that's bad.

890
00:50:05.552 --> 00:50:08.929
Okay, uh, I need to change
the bandage.

891

Um, let's... let's find a place
where you can sit down.

00:50:50.421 --> 00:50:51.464
Yeah, that's...
that's really bad.

894
00:50:51.547 --> 00:50:55.926
Um, Lily, can you find me
a knife and a lighter?

895
00:50:56.009 --> 00:50:56.676
Yeah.

896
00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:57.760
No, I'm not gonna let you...

897
00:50:57.843 --> 00:50:59.094
No, no, no,
I'm not gonna cut off your leg,

898
00:50:59.178 --> 00:51:01.305
but there's a lot of pus
built up in there

899
00:51:01.388 --> 00:51:03.097
and we need to get it out.

900
00:51:03.181 --> 00:51:04.974
It'll hurt at first,
but I promise

901
00:51:05.058 --> 00:51:08.810
it'll feel a lot better
when it's done.

902
00:51:08.894 --> 00:51:10.145
Okay.

903
00:51:10.229 --> 00:51:13.105
As long as you don't cut off
my leg I'm fine.

904
00:51:13.189 --> 00:51:16.066
Is... is this the only knife
we have?

905
00:51:16.149 --> 00:51:19.361
It's the only one I could find.

906
00:51:19.444 --> 00:51:20.487
Okay.

907
00:51:21.946 --> 00:51:23.447
(Sighing)

908
00:51:35.665 --> 00:51:37.708
You might wanna close your eyes
for this.

909
00:51:46.048 --> 00:51:47.258
(Kim grunting)

910
00:51:48.217 --> 00:51:50.134
Okay.

911
00:51:56.306 --> 00:51:59.225
(Grunting)

912
00:51:59.308 --> 00:52:01.435
GLEN:
Alright.

913
00:52:01.519 --> 00:52:07.190
Um, worst part is over.

914
00:52:07.274 --> 00:52:09.525
Wasn't that bad.

915
00:52:09.608 --> 00:52:11.694
That was like a giant zit
on your leg.

916
00:52:11.777 --> 00:52:13.153
Shut up, that's gross.

917
00:52:13.237 --> 00:52:15.405
Well, it is gross.

918
00:52:15.488 --> 00:52:17.365
I don't think I can carry
my backpack.

919
00:52:17.448 --> 00:52:18.991
I'll... I'll take it.

920
00:52:19.992 --> 00:52:23.244
Are you sure you can carry
two backpacks?

921
00:52:23.327 --> 00:52:27.248
Well, in that case,
I guess you'll take it then.

922
00:52:27.331 --> 00:52:31.042
Well, I guess I will.

923
00:52:31.126 --> 00:52:32.002
Let me know
if it gets too heavy

924
00:52:32.085 --> 00:52:33.711
and I'll take it for you.

925
00:52:33.794 --> 00:52:36.005
I'll definitely take you up
on that offer.

926
00:52:53.476 --> 00:53:00.482
(♪♪♪)

927
00:53:00.566 --> 00:53:03.693
I think we should stay here
tonight.

928
00:53:03.776 --> 00:53:05.236
Yeah, I mean this place
will work

929
00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:07.738
and at least we have
some protection behind us.

930
00:53:07.821 --> 00:53:08.739
LILY:
Exactly.

931
00:53:08.822 --> 00:53:14.994
(♪♪♪)

932
00:53:15.077 --> 00:53:16.745
Hey, can you help me
collect firewood?

933
00:53:16.828 --> 00:53:18.455
Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea.

934
00:53:18.538 --> 00:53:28.546
(♪♪♪)

935
00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:57.569
So how many more nights
are we gonna stay out here?

936
00:53:57.653 --> 00:54:00.863
This is the last night I hope.

937
00:54:00.946 --> 00:54:04.074
If not, how long
can we survive?

938
00:54:04.157 --> 00:54:08.620
Well, we're pretty much
out of food.

939
00:54:08.702 --> 00:54:12.081
Yeah, we have about
a day's worth of water.

940
00:54:12.164 --> 00:54:13.457
So basically, we're all...

941
00:54:13.539 --> 00:54:14.582
(Shushing)

942
00:54:14.666 --> 00:54:16.501
You need to stay positive.

943
00:54:16.584 --> 00:54:17.710
THOMAS:
Oh, okay.

944
00:54:17.794 --> 00:54:22.297
So instead of the glass being
99% empty, it's 1% full.

945
00:54:22.381 --> 00:54:24.173
Well, that's the spirit.

946
00:54:27.718 --> 00:54:30.220
Hey, I'm gonna keep watch
for a while

947
00:54:30.303 --> 00:54:32.138
if you wanna get some sleep.

948
00:54:32.222 --> 00:54:34.014
Okay, wake me when it's my turn.

949
00:54:34.098 --> 00:54:34.973
Alright.

950
00:54:35.057 --> 00:54:36.225
Hmm.

What the hell?

956
00:56:20.807 --> 00:56:22.476
What was that?

957
00:56:22.559 --> 00:56:23.601
(Grunting)

958
00:56:23.684 --> 00:56:25.936
I... I speared it.

959
00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:26.645
You what?

960
00:56:26.729 --> 00:56:27.730
(Taking deep breaths)

961
00:56:27.812 --> 00:56:28.646
I don't... I don't think
they're coming back.

962
00:56:28.730 --> 00:56:29.856
Well, how many were there?

963
00:56:29.939 --> 00:56:32.066
GLEN:
I think there was about three.

964
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:34.234
I can't sleep now.

965
00:56:34.318 --> 00:56:36.236
Well, how long till morning?

966
00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:41.783
Um, it's... it's 5:45 right now.

967
00:56:41.866 --> 00:56:45.952
So not too much longer
till sunrise.

968
00:56:46.036 --> 00:56:47.453
Well, that's good news.

969
00:56:47.536 --> 00:56:49.246
The only good news I want was,

970
00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:51.624
"Oh, hey,
this was just a bad dream."

981
00:59:27.872 --> 00:59:30.415
Oh my God, I can't move my leg.

What do you mean?

983
00:59:31.917 --> 00:59:33.835
I can't feel my leg.

(Taking deep breaths)

985
00:59:46.887 --> 00:59:47.888
Okay.

986
00:59:52.350 --> 00:59:55.644
Alright, I'm gonna take...
I'm gonna take your boot off.

987
00:59:55.727 --> 00:59:56.895
Okay.

988
01:00:07.654 --> 01:00:09.279
Can you feel that?

989
01:00:09.363 --> 01:00:11.448
No, I can't feel anything.

991
01:00:19.913 --> 01:00:21.164
This is bad.

992
01:00:22.582 --> 01:00:23.958
Uh... uh, can we build
a stretcher for her

993
01:00:24.041 --> 01:00:25.125
or something?

994
01:00:25.209 --> 01:00:28.211
No, that'll take too long.

995
01:00:28.294 --> 01:00:30.338
Uh, I'll just...
I'll just carry her.

996
01:00:32.006 --> 01:00:35.592
Guys, uh, okay, let's start...
let's start packing up.

998
01:01:01.153 --> 01:01:04.782
Okay, so this will be really,
really uncomfortable,

999
01:01:04.865 --> 01:01:06.199
but just let me know

1000
01:01:06.282 --> 01:01:08.910
if anything really
starts hurting.

1001
01:01:08.994 --> 01:01:10.203
I will.

Lily.

1003
01:01:13.372 --> 01:01:17.125
Just... just lift her up
really, really slowly.

01:01:17.208 --> 01:01:17.959
Okay.

1005
01:01:18.042 --> 01:01:18.835
- Ready?
- Yeah.

Yeah.

01:01:21.336 --> 01:01:22.504
Okay.

1008

Hey, Thomas,
be sure to put out the fire.

1009
01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:31.553

You guys, she has a fever.

1015
01:02:50.824 --> 01:02:53.284
Here, you need to drink that.

1016
01:02:58.371 --> 01:03:00.874
Is she gonna be okay?

1017
01:03:00.956 --> 01:03:04.293
Well, we really need to get her
to a hospital.

1018
01:03:04.376 --> 01:03:05.960
Okay, well, then we need
to move quickly.

1019

It can't be far.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:09.714
I... I hope you're right,

1021
01:03:09.798 --> 01:03:12.966
but I mean
it's gonna be dark soon.

1022
01:03:13.967 --> 01:03:19.472
Uh, Thomas, help me try to find
a campsite.

1023
01:03:21.348 --> 01:03:22.224
We'll be right back.

1024
01:03:22.307 --> 01:03:23.350

Yeah, yeah.

1028
01:03:58.752 --> 01:03:59.920
I know.

1029
01:04:03.297 --> 01:04:05.591
God, I'm tired.

1030

(Sighing)

1031
01:04:12.139 --> 01:04:16.308
I still can't believe
this is happening, you know?

1032
01:04:17.976 --> 01:04:21.354
This was just supposed
to be a simple documentary

1033
01:04:21.437 --> 01:04:24.439
about all the nonsense
that people believe

1034
01:04:24.523 --> 01:04:26.191
about this mountain.

1035
01:04:28.109 --> 01:04:29.652
But no, no,
it just so happens that

1036
01:04:29.735 --> 01:04:34.322
there are real monsters
and aliens out to kill us.

1037
01:04:34.406 --> 01:04:37.533
Oh, and not to mention,
we're also completely lost

1038
01:04:37.616 --> 01:04:41.078
in the wonderful world
of unprocessed paper.

1039
01:04:43.329 --> 01:04:44.080
(Sighing)

1040
01:04:44.164 --> 01:04:46.040
Do you or Lily have
any sort of plan

1041
01:04:46.124 --> 01:04:49.459
that doesn't involve
the afterlife?

1042
01:04:49.543 --> 01:04:54.380
GLEN:
Uh, Lily's smart.

1043
01:04:54.463 --> 01:04:57.215
I'm... I'm sure
she's figuring out something.

1044
01:05:00.051 --> 01:05:04.221
We've been in some really
bad situations before.

1045
01:05:04.305 --> 01:05:06.222
She always figures
somethin' out,

1046
01:05:06.306 --> 01:05:08.433
always comes up
with some kind of idea.

1047
01:05:11.143 --> 01:05:13.228
Never... never this bad though.

1048
01:05:16.063 --> 01:05:19.942
If... if I'd only known
the danger

1049
01:05:20.025 --> 01:05:21.985
that I've put you and Kim in,

1050
01:05:22.068 --> 01:05:25.404
I... I never...
I never would have made

1051
01:05:25.487 --> 01:05:27.323
this stupid documentary.

1052
01:05:30.325 --> 01:05:33.203
Well, I'll just ask
for some extra college credit

1053
01:05:33.286 --> 01:05:36.038
when I get back.

1054
01:05:36.121 --> 01:05:39.790
I mean I definitely had no idea

1055
01:05:39.874 --> 01:05:44.294
that there was gonna be
real aliens up here.

1056
01:05:44.377 --> 01:05:46.087
I mean you really
shouldn't be blaming yourself

1057
01:05:46.171 --> 01:05:47.380
for this.

1058
01:05:50.257 --> 01:05:54.177
Blake and Candie are dead,

1059
01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:59.598
because I didn't take
this shit seriously enough

1060
01:05:59.681 --> 01:06:02.184
to come prepared for the worst.

1061
01:06:02.267 --> 01:06:05.144
They... they trusted me to know

1062
01:06:05.228 --> 01:06:08.855
what we were getting
ourselves into,

1063
01:06:08.939 --> 01:06:12.567
I can never forgive myself
for what happened.

1064
01:06:20.823 --> 01:06:24.618
I swear I will do everything
I can to make sure

1065
01:06:24.701 --> 01:06:28.496
that you and Kim
get back home safely.

1066
01:06:31.415 --> 01:06:33.625
It's really not your fault.

1067
01:06:35.835 --> 01:06:39.296
I know it's gonna take a while
for you to understand that

1068
01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:41.589
and I know how you feel.

1069
01:06:41.673 --> 01:06:43.091
I was the one
that convinced Kim

1070
01:06:43.174 --> 01:06:46.010
that this was just gonna be
another camping trip.

1071
01:06:48.136 --> 01:06:50.722
She didn't have to come,
but she insisted on going,

1072
01:06:50.806 --> 01:06:56.059
because well, I'm a dumbass

1073
01:06:56.142 --> 01:06:58.812
and I always find ways
to get into trouble.

1074
01:07:01.272 --> 01:07:05.276
She doesn't blame you at all
and neither do I.

1075
01:07:05.359 --> 01:07:07.485
It's really all of our faults.

1076
01:07:13.407 --> 01:07:17.326
You know, we better find a cave
or something

1077
01:07:17.410 --> 01:07:19.869
or we're gonna have a little
different set of problems

1078
01:07:19.953 --> 01:07:21.288
if you know what I mean.

1079
01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:25.332
You think we can find somethin'
before it gets too dark?

1080
01:07:27.584 --> 01:07:29.627
(Sighing)

1081
01:07:29.711 --> 01:07:31.004
I don't know.

1082
01:07:35.007 --> 01:07:38.635
I was gonna suggest
we should probably uh, split up

1083
01:07:38.719 --> 01:07:44.264
and look, but I'm pretty sure
we would both get lost.

1084
01:07:46.641 --> 01:07:49.435
Now, that's a deep thought.

1085
01:07:49.518 --> 01:07:55.606
Getting lost while we're lost.

1086
01:07:55.690 --> 01:07:58.358
It's like a lost inception.

1087
01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:03.821
(Chuckling)

1088
01:08:09.326 --> 01:08:12.412
Are you ready to get movin'?

1089
01:08:12.495 --> 01:08:14.872
I was just getting comfortable.

1090
01:08:14.955 --> 01:08:17.124
So was I.

1091
01:08:42.477 --> 01:08:43.853
Yo, Glen!

1092
01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:48.273
Let's sharpen
our alien-fighting skills.

1093
01:08:48.357 --> 01:08:52.192
Thomas, we don't have the time
for this.

1094
01:08:52.276 --> 01:08:55.737
Die, alien scum!

1095
01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:57.530
Thomas, I'm serious.

1096
01:09:00.783 --> 01:09:05.287
My name
is Thomas Dingle McDingdong.

1097
01:09:05.370 --> 01:09:07.497
You killed my father.

1098
01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:09.540
Prepare to die.

1099
01:09:12.250 --> 01:09:15.044
Okay, fine, you got it.

1100
01:09:15.127 --> 01:09:17.045

1104
01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:33.101

1108
01:09:45.443 --> 01:09:48.154
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

Find my... find my glasses.

Okay, alright.

1112
01:09:52.491 --> 01:09:53.658
Alright, no problem.

1113
01:09:59.496 --> 01:10:02.165
Here, I found them.

1114
01:10:02.249 --> 01:10:03.416
Thank you.

1115

(Taking deep breaths)

1126
01:10:48.994 --> 01:10:51.036
I don't know.

1127
01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:54.457
I don't think... I don't think
I could get back up.

1128
01:10:56.624 --> 01:11:00.253
We're gonna... we're gonna have
to find a way... way around.

1129
01:11:00.335 --> 01:11:02.296
W... which way do you wanna go?

1130

I ain't goin' hungry tonight.

Well, you know,
you have to share that.

1160
01:15:14.162 --> 01:15:15.579
What else is up there?

1161
01:15:15.663 --> 01:15:17.164
Just stuff.

1162
01:15:22.752 --> 01:15:23.961
What is it?

1163
01:15:24.045 --> 01:15:29.965
Well, we got us a chicken noodle
and chili combo for only 2.99.

1164
01:15:30.049 --> 01:15:31.008
What a deal.

Rest up.

1174
01:16:49.529 --> 01:16:51.363
Tomorrow, we're getting out
of this dump for sure.

1175
01:16:54.241 --> 01:16:59.620
Thomas, you have to promise me
that you'll leave tomorrow

1176
01:16:59.704 --> 01:17:00.996
even if I can't.

1177
01:17:01.079 --> 01:17:03.123
What?
No.

1178
01:17:03.206 --> 01:17:06.792
I'm your big sister,
you have to do what I say.

1179
01:17:06.876 --> 01:17:09.419
No, I'm not leaving you here.

Don't... don't do that.

What are we gonna do?

1199
01:18:48.248 --> 01:18:49.165
I don't know.

1200
01:18:49.249 --> 01:18:51.208
Well, hopefully they stay back.

1201
01:18:56.128 --> 01:18:57.588
I don't see nothing.

1202
01:18:57.672 --> 01:19:01.132
Well, they're...
they're out there.

1203
01:19:01.216 --> 01:19:04.719
Well, I think
we should keep an eye out.

1204
01:19:04.802 --> 01:19:06.303
I'll go first.

1205
01:19:06.387 --> 01:19:09.806
Alright, well, wake one of us
up in an hour or two, okay?

1206
01:19:09.889 --> 01:19:11.723
Don't fall asleep.

1207
01:19:11.808 --> 01:19:12.892
Well, that kind of defeats
the purpose

1208
01:19:12.976 --> 01:19:14.392
of keeping watch now, don't it?

Well, be careful how you aim,

we can't afford
to waste bullets.

1244

Yeah, but we can't hold them off
forever.

1245

01:24:29.309 --> 01:24:31.727
No, but I'm feeling better.

1253
01:24:31.811 --> 01:24:33.603
Well, how's your leg?

1254
01:24:33.687 --> 01:24:35.189
I think I can feel it now.

1255
01:24:35.272 --> 01:24:36.106
LILY:
They're back.

1256
01:24:36.189 --> 01:24:46.197
(♪♪♪)

1257
01:24:57.330 --> 01:24:59.748
Where'd they go?

1258
01:24:59.833 --> 01:25:01.167
GLEN:
I don't know.

1259
01:25:05.879 --> 01:25:08.131
(Thudding and rumbling)

1260
01:25:08.215 --> 01:25:10.341
(Growling)

1261
01:25:10.424 --> 01:25:19.723
(♪♪♪)

1262
01:25:19.807 --> 01:25:21.142
(Gunshot)

1263
01:25:24.811 --> 01:25:26.729
Thomas,
give me another shell now!

1264
01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:34.193
(Gunshot)

1265
01:25:37.988 --> 01:25:40.782
(Grunting)

1266
01:25:43.409 --> 01:25:53.416
(♪♪♪)

1267
01:26:07.011 --> 01:26:08.511
Are you alright?

1268
01:26:08.596 --> 01:26:09.597
(Sobbing)

1269
01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:11.140
I'm not.

1270
01:26:12.765 --> 01:26:14.392
They keep breaking in.

1271
01:26:14.474 --> 01:26:16.643
We're practically out of ammo.

1272
01:26:20.898 --> 01:26:23.608
Blake and Candie are dead.

1273
01:26:25.776 --> 01:26:27.986
And I don't want us
to end up like them.

1274
01:26:28.069 --> 01:26:29.945
(Sobbing)

1275
01:26:30.030 --> 01:26:31.697
You got us this far.

1276
01:26:33.449 --> 01:26:35.909
We need to keep fighting.

1277
01:26:35.992 --> 01:26:37.202
Fighting together.

1278
01:26:37.285 --> 01:26:39.370
(Sniffling)

1279
01:26:46.792 --> 01:26:49.295
What's important.

1280
01:26:49.378 --> 01:26:53.172
What's really important is that
we have each other.

1281
01:26:57.301 --> 01:26:59.094
I love you so much.

1282
01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:06.016
What would I ever do
without you?

1283
01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:11.103
You'd be sad and alone.

1284
01:27:11.186 --> 01:27:21.195
(♪♪♪)

1285
01:27:23.905 --> 01:27:26.950
THOMAS: Uh, guys,
you might wanna look out the window.

1286
01:27:34.288 --> 01:27:36.582
(Growling)

1287
01:27:39.876 --> 01:27:42.087
Alright, Thomas, you need
to get me some more ammo.

1288
01:27:42.170 --> 01:27:44.505
About that,
there isn't any left.

1289
01:27:46.298 --> 01:27:48.424
Okay, well, there's got to be
more around here.

1290
01:27:48.508 --> 01:27:51.052
I already checked, but whatever
makes you feel better.

1291
01:27:51.135 --> 01:27:53.427
Alright, well,
just help me look.

1292
01:27:53.512 --> 01:28:03.520
(♪♪♪)

1293
01:28:15.363 --> 01:28:18.282
LILY:
Hey guys, I found something.

1294
01:28:18.365 --> 01:28:29.207
(♪♪♪)

1295
01:28:29.291 --> 01:28:32.459
Whoever owned this cabin
must have been a serious hunter.

1296
01:28:32.543 --> 01:28:34.294
Yeah, no kidding.

1297
01:28:34.378 --> 01:28:35.962
Well, we can definitely
use those.

1298
01:28:36.045 --> 01:28:36.712
Yeah.

1299
01:28:36.796 --> 01:28:39.173
What is it?

1300
01:28:39.257 --> 01:28:40.881
Oh, just another kinda
boomstick.

1301
01:28:40.966 --> 01:28:43.093
Be careful with those.

1302
01:28:43.176 --> 01:28:45.386
Oh, it's okay as long
as you don't drop it.

1303
01:28:45.469 --> 01:28:52.976
(♪♪♪)

1304
01:28:53.058 --> 01:28:56.687
You guys, we can't stay here
especially without ammo.

1305
01:28:56.770 --> 01:28:59.315
This is what I think
we should do.

1306
01:28:59.397 --> 01:29:01.649
Wait for it to get close,
light the dynamite,

1307
01:29:01.733 --> 01:29:03.526
then get out as fast as we can.

1308
01:29:03.609 --> 01:29:05.027
By the time it breaks in,
it should be ready to...

1309
01:29:05.110 --> 01:29:06.528
Kaboom!

1310
01:29:06.611 --> 01:29:08.780
Exactly.

1311
01:29:08.864 --> 01:29:11.782
Well, sounds like it could work.

1312
01:29:11.866 --> 01:29:13.451
Uh, guys,
I don't mean to be pushing,

1313
01:29:13.534 --> 01:29:16.077
but we got like
T-minus 35 times

1314
01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:17.704
whatever to get out of here.

1315
01:29:17.787 --> 01:29:18.828
Get Kim to the door...

1316
01:29:18.912 --> 01:29:20.039
- Alright.
- I'll get this one.

1317
01:29:20.122 --> 01:29:30.130
(♪♪♪)

1318
01:29:32.841 --> 01:29:34.424
(Growling)

1319
01:29:34.508 --> 01:29:35.509
Get ready.

1320
01:29:35.593 --> 01:29:45.600
(♪♪♪)

1321
01:29:57.735 --> 01:29:59.362
Now!

1322
01:29:59.445 --> 01:30:09.452
(♪♪♪)

1323
01:30:21.545 --> 01:30:23.756
(Growling)

1324
01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:31.553
Do you think she lit it?

1325
01:30:31.637 --> 01:30:32.596
Of course, I did.

1326
01:30:32.679 --> 01:30:33.931
KIM:
Maybe it's a dud.

1327
01:30:34.014 --> 01:30:35.515
(Growling)

1328
01:30:35.598 --> 01:30:38.851
(Explosion)

1329
01:30:38.935 --> 01:30:39.893
(Chuckling)

1330
01:30:39.977 --> 01:30:41.228
I think we got it.

1331
01:30:41.311 --> 01:30:42.311
(Chuckling)

1332
01:30:43.772 --> 01:30:46.273
I'll admit for a moment there
I thought for sure

1333
01:30:46.357 --> 01:30:48.275
- we were all dead.
- For a moment?

1334
01:30:48.359 --> 01:30:49.818
I've been thinkin' that
since day one.

1335
01:30:49.901 --> 01:30:51.403
I'm just glad it's over.

1336
01:30:51.486 --> 01:30:53.446
Well, it's not over yet,
we're still lost.

1337
01:30:53.530 --> 01:30:55.114
Okay, but it could be
a lot worse.

1338
01:30:57.032 --> 01:30:59.492
Right, we need to get moving.

1339
01:30:59.575 --> 01:31:00.493
(Taking deep breaths)

1340
01:31:00.575 --> 01:31:02.412
Which way?

1341
01:31:02.495 --> 01:31:03.788
Same way we've been going.

1342
01:31:03.870 --> 01:31:13.878
(♪♪♪)

1343
01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:27.140
I'm in love with a road.

1344
01:31:27.222 --> 01:31:28.098
(Chuckling)

1345
01:31:28.181 --> 01:31:30.058
Oh, I missed you!

1346
01:31:30.141 --> 01:31:31.226
Here, take some of these.

1347
01:31:31.309 --> 01:31:32.768
I got plenty more
where that came from.

1348
01:31:32.852 --> 01:31:33.936
And now, we're rich.

1349
01:31:34.019 --> 01:31:34.895
With happiness.

1350
01:31:34.979 --> 01:31:36.147
(Chuckling)

1351
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:38.523
Um, which way do we walk now?

1352
01:31:38.606 --> 01:31:40.817
I think
we just keep walking on down.

1353
01:31:40.900 --> 01:31:44.278
Yeah, I've been wanting
to do that all day.

1354
01:31:44.361 --> 01:31:45.946
Okay, that sounds like a plan.

1355
01:31:46.029 --> 01:31:47.030
Okay.

1356
01:31:47.114 --> 01:31:57.121
