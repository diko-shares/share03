00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:03.017
<i>Hey, we're like a minute away.
Can you see me?</i>

2
00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:05.916
<i>Having trouble
with the picture. CC's a little buggy.</i>

3
00:01:06.083 --> 00:01:07.291
How about now?

4
00:01:07.458 --> 00:01:09.375
<i>Ah! There you are. Very chic.</i>

5
00:01:09.541 --> 00:01:11.458
Thank you. And our friend?

6
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.892
<i>He's gonna be a tall bald guy
with a leather jacket.</i>

7
00:01:13.916 --> 00:01:15.636
<i>Meeting's just out.
They're coming your way.</i>

8
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.125
<i>Fifty meters.</i>

9
00:01:20.708 --> 00:01:21.958
{\an8}<i>Forty-five.</i>

10
00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.916
<i>- Thirty-five meters now.</i>
- Uh-huh.

11
00:01:32.916 --> 00:01:34.958
{\an8}<i>Twenty meters.</i>

12
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:41.833
<i>Ten meters.</i>

13
00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:43.958
OK, gotta go.

14
00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:53.750
Hi there.

15
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.500
Hey, I got it.

16
00:03:06.291 --> 00:03:09.875
Mommy!

17
00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:12.000
Pistachio!

18
00:03:12.916 --> 00:03:15.208
Have you been eating bowling balls again?

19
00:03:15.375 --> 00:03:16.975
- Yes.
- Yes? How many?

20
00:03:17.125 --> 00:03:20.083
- Ten.
- Ten?

21
00:03:21.875 --> 00:03:23.708
- Did you miss me?
- Yeah.

22
00:03:23.875 --> 00:03:26.583
I missed you too.
Where have our men gone?

23
00:03:32.375 --> 00:03:35.041
- Hello.
- She's back!

24
00:03:35.208 --> 00:03:37.708
Yes, with a vengeance.

25
00:03:37.875 --> 00:03:39.333
Hi! Oh!

26
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.291
Making my favorite pineapple chicken?

27
00:03:41.458 --> 00:03:42.666
That I am.

28
00:03:42.833 --> 00:03:44.458
Aww... Hi.

29
00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:46.000
How was Nebraska?

30
00:03:46.166 --> 00:03:48.041
It was... Thank you... Meh.

31
00:03:48.208 --> 00:03:51.958
Four days of teaching mid level management
how to add vegan options

32
00:03:52.125 --> 00:03:54.000
to their franchise plans, which...

33
00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:57.541
I can guarantee is never gonna
happen in Plattsmouth, Nebraska.

34
00:03:59.041 --> 00:04:01.583
Then corporate made us go on
a six-hour team building

35
00:04:01.791 --> 00:04:04.041
glassworks tour on the final day.

36
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.750
- You know, it was...
- The usual?

37
00:04:06.916 --> 00:04:07.916
Yeah! The usual.

38
00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:10.875
Hey, where is Wy?
Trash bins are still out.

39
00:04:11.041 --> 00:04:12.875
Because they're too heavy.

40
00:04:13.041 --> 00:04:16.333
That cannot be, because this little one
ate all the bowling balls.

41
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.208
Hello, my love. I missed you.

42
00:04:18.416 --> 00:04:21.250
OK. Those babies are going low and slow.

43
00:04:22.375 --> 00:04:23.375
Let's go.

44
00:04:23.458 --> 00:04:25.083
Honey, you uh...

45
00:04:27.083 --> 00:04:28.083
want to freshen up?

46
00:04:28.166 --> 00:04:29.500
- Hm?
- Hey Mom, look.

47
00:04:29.708 --> 00:04:31.333
We're doing fancy restaurant.

48
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.708
Fancy restaurant?

49
00:04:32.916 --> 00:04:35.516
- I'm going to be the bartender.
- And I'm going to be the waiter.

50
00:04:37.375 --> 00:04:40.416
And you made the pineapple chicken?

51
00:04:42.458 --> 00:04:44.458
Happy anniversary.

52
00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:48.458
Ah...

53
00:05:05.875 --> 00:05:08.625
<i>You forgot the anniversary. Sweet Jesus.</i>

54
00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:11.875
<i>You must be riddled with guilt.
How do you deal with it?</i>

55
00:05:12.083 --> 00:05:14.500
Well I'm currently busy making
the world's best pancakes.

56
00:05:15.208 --> 00:05:16.208
<i>Well, does it work?</i>

57
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.333
Not even close.

58
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.541
<i>So, Buenos Aires job: client happy,
money wired...</i>

59
00:05:21.708 --> 00:05:24.388
- It's Raj again.
<i>- ...police in the wind as usual.</i>

60
00:05:24.416 --> 00:05:26.096
- Uh-huh.
<i>- Got some good news</i>

61
00:05:26.208 --> 00:05:27.541
<i>and some bad news.</i>

62
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.041
<i>Bad news is your picture popped up again
on the dark net Most Wanted list.</i>

63
00:05:31.208 --> 00:05:33.833
<i>Good news is, I think
I scrubbed it out in time.</i>

64
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.583
<i>But you've got to stay low.</i>

65
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.375
Mm-hm. Yep, I got it.

66
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:39.166
Hey, can we talk about this later?

67
00:05:39.333 --> 00:05:41.500
<i>Oh, Dave's there is he?
I won't keep you.</i>

68
00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:43.416
<i>- But there's another job.</i>
- Mm-hm.

69
00:05:43.583 --> 00:05:45.583
No, no, no. Not a chance.
Come on, I just got back.

70
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.750
<i>Shame. It's a lot of money, this one.</i>

71
00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.750
<i>And they want the best,</i>

72
00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:51.666
<i>which just so happens to be you.</i>

73
00:05:51.833 --> 00:05:54.041
Yeah. Raj, I am aware of that.

74
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.250
We talked about this,
no more trips till November.

75
00:05:56.416 --> 00:05:57.833
<i>Take a break. Fine.</i>

76
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.281
<i>But Sovereign still has
a very healthy reward on your head</i>

77
00:06:00.416 --> 00:06:02.583
<i>for anyone who finds you.</i>

78
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.708
<i>Now if you don't work,
I don't have the funds to keep you safe.</i>

79
00:06:06.875 --> 00:06:08.166
<i>And it isn't cheap.</i>

80
00:06:08.333 --> 00:06:11.053
Can I call you tomorrow? These pancakes
are getting burned over here.

81
00:06:11.166 --> 00:06:14.041
<i>Not surprised. Don't say
I didn't warn you about the heat.</i>

82
00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:16.666
Funny. Talk to you tomorrow.

83
00:06:16.833 --> 00:06:18.875
<i>Just be careful. I'm trying to...</i>

84
00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:21.375
- You OK?
- Yeah. Work.

85
00:06:21.583 --> 00:06:24.434
If it were up to them, they'd have me run
the entire Midwest at this point.

86
00:06:24.458 --> 00:06:26.000
You're too good at your job.

87
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.041
So they tell me.

88
00:06:28.208 --> 00:06:30.088
- Who wants pancakes?
- Me!

89
00:06:30.166 --> 00:06:31.166
All right.

90
00:06:31.208 --> 00:06:32.583
There you go.

91
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.500
And... there you go, honey.

92
00:06:36.666 --> 00:06:38.083
There you go, baby.

93
00:06:39.333 --> 00:06:42.416
Hey, I didn't want the bunny one.
I want the boring one.

94
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.666
There you go. Problem...

95
00:06:45.333 --> 00:06:46.333
Solved!

96
00:06:46.458 --> 00:06:47.916
- Good job.
- You're welcome.

97
00:06:48.125 --> 00:06:49.916
- I'll take that.
- Hey!

98
00:06:50.333 --> 00:06:51.708
- Bye!
- Bye!

99
00:06:51.916 --> 00:06:54.375
- I'll make you another one.
- So as I said...

100
00:06:54.541 --> 00:06:56.166
Mr. Fluff and the Monkey Princess

101
00:06:56.375 --> 00:06:57.875
can't go together

102
00:06:58.041 --> 00:06:59.666
because they're not getting along.

103
00:06:59.833 --> 00:07:02.833
OK. Why is Mr. Fluff
and the Monkey Princess feuding?

104
00:07:03.041 --> 00:07:04.541
Because he's jealous.

105
00:07:04.708 --> 00:07:06.708
Jealous of who?
Johnny the Jackalope?

106
00:07:06.916 --> 00:07:09.083
Jealous of the Phantom Queen.

107
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.333
The Phantom Queen. OK.

108
00:07:11.541 --> 00:07:14.083
All right honey, hold that thought, OK?

109
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.625
I don't know man.
It's just something's off, you know?

110
00:07:24.916 --> 00:07:27.458
Trina just...
She feels like she's a million miles away.

111
00:07:28.333 --> 00:07:31.416
I mean, now she's at her sister's wedding
and not a single text.

112
00:07:31.916 --> 00:07:33.958
She's at her sister's wedding
and you're not there?

113
00:07:34.166 --> 00:07:35.166
Yeah. Why, is that bad?

114
00:07:35.375 --> 00:07:37.875
Well, it's not great, Kev.

115
00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:41.250
See,
this is why I need your perspective here.

116
00:07:41.458 --> 00:07:42.666
Because you know.

117
00:07:43.041 --> 00:07:46.083
I mean, you and Emma have been
married, what now? 20 years?

118
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:47.250
Seven.

119
00:07:48.083 --> 00:07:50.750
You guys are like, well...

120
00:07:50.916 --> 00:07:52.083
couple goals.

121
00:07:53.916 --> 00:07:54.916
Yeah.

122
00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.166
No, no, no. It's still not OK.

123
00:07:58.375 --> 00:08:01.333
I knew you were coming off a long week.
I was coming off a long week.

124
00:08:01.541 --> 00:08:03.291
I figured we'd do something this weekend.

125
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.375
Well, you made my favorite meal.
The kids did fancy restaurant.

126
00:08:06.583 --> 00:08:09.000
- I blew it.
- You had a long week.

127
00:08:09.208 --> 00:08:11.375
I forgot our anniversary.

128
00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:12.916
I'm the worst.

129
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:32.250
What's that?

130
00:08:32.291 --> 00:08:33.791
- What?
- That.

131
00:08:35.416 --> 00:08:38.333
- Uh... This?
- Yes!

132
00:08:39.041 --> 00:08:41.291
This may be a... maybe a mistake.

133
00:08:41.458 --> 00:08:43.125
Dave! Did...

134
00:08:44.333 --> 00:08:46.583
Did you get me trashy lingerie?

135
00:08:48.041 --> 00:08:49.125
I mean, see what you think.

136
00:08:50.583 --> 00:08:53.375
You did and it's a costume!

137
00:08:54.666 --> 00:08:57.833
- Ha! Sexy nurse.
- Well, sexy nurse practitioner.

138
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.958
- Oh right, no, of course.
- Bit much?

139
00:09:01.125 --> 00:09:03.000
No, no, not at all.

140
00:09:03.166 --> 00:09:05.125
I mean I just thought, you know,
it might be...

141
00:09:05.583 --> 00:09:08.083
fun to mix things up a bit.

142
00:09:12.666 --> 00:09:14.875
Is that what you want?
To mix things up a bit?

143
00:09:15.333 --> 00:09:16.813
Or do you want me to be someone else?

144
00:09:19.375 --> 00:09:20.416
For one night.

145
00:09:22.625 --> 00:09:23.958
Uh...

146
00:09:24.125 --> 00:09:25.375
I mean...

147
00:09:26.416 --> 00:09:27.708
Why not?

148
00:09:29.083 --> 00:09:30.625
I could change things up too.

149
00:09:30.833 --> 00:09:33.875
- This would be a two way street, so yeah.
- Sure, I could go Doctor.

150
00:09:34.041 --> 00:09:35.625
Stay on theme.

151
00:09:35.791 --> 00:09:38.083
- I need a stethoscope...
- Yes, but I...

152
00:09:39.083 --> 00:09:40.458
Let's do this for real.

153
00:09:41.791 --> 00:09:43.125
Tomorrow night in the city.

154
00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:45.708
Tomorrow night.
Short notice for a babysitter.

155
00:09:45.916 --> 00:09:47.716
Well, your sister still owes us
for Christmas.

156
00:09:47.916 --> 00:09:50.476
She does still owe us for Christmas.
OK so what are you thinking?

157
00:09:50.666 --> 00:09:51.958
See a show?

158
00:09:52.833 --> 00:09:55.208
No, we're not going to see a show, Dave.

159
00:09:56.666 --> 00:09:57.750
We're going to a hotel.

160
00:09:59.416 --> 00:10:01.375
- We're going to a hotel?
- A fancy hotel.

161
00:10:02.791 --> 00:10:05.833
We are going to meet by chance
in the hotel bar.

162
00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.458
I won't be me.

163
00:10:08.625 --> 00:10:09.666
You won't be you.

164
00:10:09.875 --> 00:10:13.000
Just two strangers meeting in a bar.

165
00:10:13.208 --> 00:10:16.250
Just two strangers meeting in a bar.

166
00:10:17.791 --> 00:10:20.458
<i>Mommy! I need a glass of water!</i>

167
00:10:20.625 --> 00:10:22.041
Tomorrow night.

168
00:10:23.458 --> 00:10:25.666
- Tomorrow night.
- Tomorrow night.

169
00:10:27.125 --> 00:10:28.458
I'm gonna hold on to this.

170
00:10:29.083 --> 00:10:32.500
Come back here,
I'm gonna get what you stole!

171
00:10:32.666 --> 00:10:33.791
No, you're not.

172
00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:37.291
Guys, slow it down!

173
00:10:37.458 --> 00:10:39.083
Oh my God!

174
00:10:39.583 --> 00:10:42.708
I think it's great. I really do.
You guys deserve this.

175
00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:45.000
Yeah. Yeah it's just, you know...

176
00:10:45.208 --> 00:10:47.041
- We do, right?
- Hell yes.

177
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:51.333
You've both been working a lot.
The kids are awesome.

178
00:10:54.833 --> 00:10:56.458
You guys never leave the house

179
00:10:56.666 --> 00:10:59.106
and a backyard barbecue ain't gonna cut it
for an anniversary.

180
00:11:01.041 --> 00:11:02.250
OK.

181
00:11:02.416 --> 00:11:03.776
- Show me the shoes.
- Yeah.

182
00:11:05.166 --> 00:11:06.916
Wait till you see the wig.

183
00:11:30.875 --> 00:11:32.250
Evening, miss.

184
00:12:04.583 --> 00:12:05.583
Excuse me.

185
00:12:05.708 --> 00:12:07.267
- Vodka martini, please.
- Yes.

186
00:12:07.291 --> 00:12:08.291
Thanks.

187
00:12:16.708 --> 00:12:18.166
Come on!

188
00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:32.375
Really?

189
00:12:42.333 --> 00:12:43.333
Miss.

190
00:12:43.416 --> 00:12:45.416
Compliments of the gentleman.

191
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.916
The kind of night I'm having
you wouldn't believe.

192
00:13:07.333 --> 00:13:08.333
Really?

193
00:13:08.916 --> 00:13:11.125
This is the kind of night
if I didn't find an empty seat

194
00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:13.171
next to a beautiful woman
at a well-stocked bar,

195
00:13:13.333 --> 00:13:17.041
I might start to question my luck in life.
But then, here I am.

196
00:13:18.041 --> 00:13:19.791
So how bad a night can it be?

197
00:13:20.416 --> 00:13:22.125
Bob Kitterman.

198
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.541
- Alice Overby.
- Wonderful.

199
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.583
Well...

200
00:13:31.583 --> 00:13:35.541
Alice Overby,
are you here alone? May I ask?

201
00:13:35.708 --> 00:13:37.041
It would appear to be, Bob.

202
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.083
Well, well. Traveling?

203
00:13:40.291 --> 00:13:42.041
- It is a hotel, Bob.
- Fair enough.

204
00:13:42.208 --> 00:13:44.601
People end up in hotels for all
kinds of reasons, don't they?

205
00:13:44.625 --> 00:13:45.708
That is true.

206
00:13:45.875 --> 00:13:47.916
Forgive me.
I have to ask, are you a model?

207
00:13:48.125 --> 00:13:49.125
Ha!

208
00:13:49.291 --> 00:13:52.833
Your expression says I overshot.
But I assure you, it's not a line.

209
00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:56.125
You're very beautiful.
And you do look familiar.

210
00:13:56.291 --> 00:13:58.375
Well, thank you,
but I'm actually in finance.

211
00:13:58.583 --> 00:13:59.583
Ah!

212
00:13:59.625 --> 00:14:01.791
That's why I've felt
such a profound connection to you.

213
00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.416
Seeing you from over there, like I...
like I've known you for a long, long time.

214
00:14:05.625 --> 00:14:07.125
Are you in finance too, Bob?

215
00:14:07.291 --> 00:14:09.559
Don't worry, I'm not going
to tear your ear off about work.

216
00:14:09.583 --> 00:14:12.791
I have a strict policy
of keeping my daytimes out of my nights

217
00:14:13.416 --> 00:14:15.000
and vice versa.

218
00:14:16.375 --> 00:14:17.958
But let me ask you

219
00:14:18.458 --> 00:14:19.583
one question.

220
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.500
OK Bob, one question.

221
00:14:23.041 --> 00:14:26.416
Do you love what you do?

222
00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:33.958
Some days.

223
00:14:36.083 --> 00:14:38.708
Some days, she says.
She kills me, this one.

224
00:14:39.875 --> 00:14:43.666
Alice Overby loves what she does
some days. I'll drink to that.

225
00:14:49.208 --> 00:14:51.375
All right well there it is,
mystery solved.

226
00:14:52.083 --> 00:14:53.666
But you really do look familiar.

227
00:14:53.875 --> 00:14:57.416
And I don't mean that
as some kind of line...

228
00:14:57.583 --> 00:14:59.291
some kind of ploy.

229
00:15:00.583 --> 00:15:02.375
I just have that kind of face, I guess.

230
00:15:03.208 --> 00:15:06.250
Some people do have that kind of face,
like an old girlfriend...

231
00:15:14.708 --> 00:15:17.068
- What can I get you?
- I'll do an old fashioned.

232
00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:18.166
- Sure.
- Thanks.

233
00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:19.916
There are some young women

234
00:15:20.083 --> 00:15:22.291
that fall easily under the spell
of a much older man,

235
00:15:22.458 --> 00:15:24.958
but I suspect you
may not be one of them.

236
00:15:25.125 --> 00:15:27.325
Not the way you're making eyes
at this one down the bar.

237
00:15:28.208 --> 00:15:31.291
Look, as a little junior broker
on his night out,

238
00:15:31.708 --> 00:15:33.541
if I can be frank,
I think you can do better.

239
00:15:34.208 --> 00:15:35.666
Maybe I'm not in the market, Bob.

240
00:15:35.833 --> 00:15:37.166
Ah, I see.

241
00:15:37.333 --> 00:15:39.666
Just unwinding at the end
of a long day of business travel,

242
00:15:39.833 --> 00:15:41.392
wanting to be alone with your thoughts.

243
00:15:41.416 --> 00:15:43.208
- Trying.
- Well, Alice.

244
00:15:43.375 --> 00:15:44.895
I'm going to give you that opportunity

245
00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.625
because I must remove myself for a moment.

246
00:15:48.083 --> 00:15:50.500
But, uh... Don't you go anywhere.

247
00:15:50.666 --> 00:15:52.625
Oh, no promises, Bob.

248
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:29.291
Have we met?

249
00:16:30.416 --> 00:16:31.416
I don't think so.

250
00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:32.750
Oh.

251
00:16:33.333 --> 00:16:34.333
Well, I'm Jack.

252
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.833
Jack. Alice Overby.

253
00:16:37.375 --> 00:16:39.208
Jack Dawson.

254
00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:43.458
Jack Dawson.
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

255
00:16:44.291 --> 00:16:45.791
Jack Dawson.

256
00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.500
Leo. <i>Titanic.</i> Really?

257
00:16:52.208 --> 00:16:54.250
How about, uh...
How about I buy you a drink?

258
00:16:55.208 --> 00:16:56.500
Yes, please.

259
00:16:56.666 --> 00:16:59.166
That is, unless your friend would mind.

260
00:16:59.333 --> 00:17:01.041
Oh, he's not my friend. We just met.

261
00:17:04.916 --> 00:17:06.416
What are you drinking, Alice?

262
00:17:06.583 --> 00:17:08.666
- Vodka martini.
- All right.

263
00:17:09.208 --> 00:17:12.916
Excuse me. I'd like a vodka
martini for the lady

264
00:17:13.083 --> 00:17:15.791
and I'll bill that to the room,
if that's all right.

265
00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.041
Sure. I just need the name
and the room number.

266
00:17:18.208 --> 00:17:19.708
It's Jack...

267
00:17:20.291 --> 00:17:22.333
Dawson. And the room number is...

268
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.958
Put that on mine, Chaz,
if that's all right with you, Jack.

269
00:17:25.125 --> 00:17:26.525
- Oh, no, it's fine.
- Please.

270
00:17:26.625 --> 00:17:29.505
Just had some very nice news about work
and I'm in the mood to celebrate.

271
00:17:29.541 --> 00:17:32.125
Another scotch and soda for me.
Jack, another old fashioned?

272
00:17:32.291 --> 00:17:34.125
Uh, sure... Thanks.

273
00:17:34.291 --> 00:17:35.458
Jack, Bob. Bob, Jack.

274
00:17:35.625 --> 00:17:38.208
- Pleasure, Jack. Great suit.
- Oh, thank you.

275
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:40.583
- Staying at the hotel?
- That's right.

276
00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:42.916
Um... In town for business.

277
00:17:43.083 --> 00:17:45.844
Well, the lady and I have made
a very firm agreement not to talk shop,

278
00:17:45.916 --> 00:17:48.875
so I'll ask what it is you do.
We'll leave it at that.

279
00:17:49.166 --> 00:17:52.625
Yes, please do tell us.
Please tell us. Jack, What do you do?

280
00:17:54.666 --> 00:17:56.166
I'm a photographer.

281
00:17:56.333 --> 00:17:58.583
Wow! Art or commerce?

282
00:17:58.750 --> 00:17:59.958
Journalism, mainly.

283
00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:03.625
I used to photograph combat zones,

284
00:18:03.791 --> 00:18:05.750
but now it's mainly wildlife.

285
00:18:05.916 --> 00:18:08.166
Exotic locales, that kind of thing.

286
00:18:08.333 --> 00:18:10.125
Wow! Wonderful, don't you think?

287
00:18:10.291 --> 00:18:11.375
Yeah, wonderful.

288
00:18:11.541 --> 00:18:13.416
I'm in finance myself, like the lady here.

289
00:18:13.583 --> 00:18:18.208
So for two sharks like us:
Wow, Jack, photography!

290
00:18:18.375 --> 00:18:19.625
Now,

291
00:18:19.791 --> 00:18:23.416
maybe those drinks won't quite suffice.
How about...

292
00:18:24.083 --> 00:18:24.916
a shot?

293
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.500
- Oh, I don't think...
- I don't remember the last time I did one.

294
00:18:29.666 --> 00:18:32.291
Chaz, this rowdy crowd here
is fixing to add some shots.

295
00:18:32.458 --> 00:18:35.083
Some of that nice mezcal
you showed me last night.

296
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:37.833
In the business we're in,
good news is so rare.

297
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.541
I appreciate the company
for a celebratory round.

298
00:18:40.708 --> 00:18:43.416
Congrats Bob,
on whatever good news you've got.

299
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.750
Well I don't mean to be coy, of course,

300
00:18:46.916 --> 00:18:51.083
but as it happens, a rather large contract
has all but fallen in my lap.

301
00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:54.041
So naturally, I'm over the moon.

302
00:18:54.208 --> 00:18:57.750
Sure, you'd be interested in the detail.

303
00:18:57.916 --> 00:19:00.516
I didn't get the particulars
of which part of the financial sector

304
00:19:00.541 --> 00:19:01.541
you're in, did I Alice?

305
00:19:01.708 --> 00:19:03.375
Mergers and acquisitions.

306
00:19:03.541 --> 00:19:07.375
Ah! So yes, I'm sure
we do have a lot in common after all.

307
00:19:07.541 --> 00:19:10.181
- You're not based in New York?
- No, just here for meetings.

308
00:19:10.333 --> 00:19:12.653
I thought we might have
some European colleagues in common.

309
00:19:12.708 --> 00:19:13.708
Domestic only.

310
00:19:13.791 --> 00:19:15.671
- Aren't we done talking business, Bob?
- Right.

311
00:19:15.833 --> 00:19:19.208
Make a rule just to break it.
Naughty Bob! Ah, wonderful.

312
00:19:20.916 --> 00:19:22.166
<i>Salute.</i>

313
00:19:22.333 --> 00:19:23.453
- Hm...
- Hm...

314
00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.000
Yeah.

315
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.833
Wow!

316
00:19:30.708 --> 00:19:32.875
I should have warned you.
Bit of a kick.

317
00:19:33.041 --> 00:19:34.791
Oh, yeah.
That's why I don't take shots.

318
00:19:37.291 --> 00:19:39.375
Excuse me, can I get a water please?
Thank you.

319
00:19:39.541 --> 00:19:41.958
This one is bright as a button, Jack.
You better believe it.

320
00:19:42.125 --> 00:19:43.166
Oh, I believe it.

321
00:19:43.333 --> 00:19:45.500
The kind of woman
a lot of men are looking for.

322
00:19:45.666 --> 00:19:47.166
A lot of men might kill for.

323
00:19:47.333 --> 00:19:50.000
Aren't we lucky to keep her company
even for a fleeting moment?

324
00:19:50.166 --> 00:19:51.875
In fact, I'll raise a glass to it.

325
00:19:53.166 --> 00:19:55.958
To... It is Alice, isn't it?

326
00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.958
As long as I can remember, Bob.

327
00:19:58.125 --> 00:19:59.541
To Alice Overby.

328
00:19:59.708 --> 00:20:03.875
And to all the less lucky victims
of her considerable charms.

329
00:20:11.166 --> 00:20:12.416
Another.

330
00:20:12.583 --> 00:20:13.958
We're good.

331
00:20:14.375 --> 00:20:15.375
Bob...

332
00:20:15.541 --> 00:20:17.541
- It's been a pleasure.
- Ah!

333
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.250
I see. It would appear
I am cramping the young man's style.

334
00:20:21.416 --> 00:20:23.096
- Heaven forbid.
- I don't mean to be rude.

335
00:20:23.208 --> 00:20:24.208
No, of course not.

336
00:20:24.375 --> 00:20:26.375
If I were 20 years younger,
I might take offence...

337
00:20:26.458 --> 00:20:27.458
Bob!

338
00:20:27.541 --> 00:20:30.291
The hint is taken. So I will leave you.

339
00:20:30.458 --> 00:20:32.958
And Jack...
best of luck.

340
00:20:33.125 --> 00:20:34.250
And Alice, dear,

341
00:20:34.416 --> 00:20:36.750
dear, Alice.

342
00:20:36.916 --> 00:20:39.583
511 is the sweet number.
If anyone's itching for a nightcap,

343
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:41.708
once they blink the lights.

344
00:20:42.125 --> 00:20:43.500
And on that note...

345
00:20:44.166 --> 00:20:45.166
Pow.

346
00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:51.375
I cannot believe we're finally alone.

347
00:20:51.541 --> 00:20:53.958
It is hard to believe, isn't it?

348
00:20:54.791 --> 00:20:57.708
So should we continue
getting to know each other, Jack?

349
00:20:58.583 --> 00:21:01.750
I would like that, Alice.
I would like that a lot.

350
00:21:02.125 --> 00:21:03.250
More shots?

351
00:21:07.166 --> 00:21:10.833
I'm actually here
scouting a location for a...

352
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
new solo show I have in the spring.

353
00:21:15.166 --> 00:21:17.041
- Solo? Cool.
- Yeah, sure.

354
00:21:17.208 --> 00:21:20.083
All the photographs I've taken in Beirut.

355
00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.500
And Turks and Caicos.

356
00:21:22.666 --> 00:21:24.875
- Turks and Caicos?
- Both of them.

357
00:21:25.041 --> 00:21:27.958
Is that your room, Mr. Dawson?

358
00:21:28.125 --> 00:21:29.708
- Yeah, yeah.
- OK.

359
00:21:29.875 --> 00:21:31.750
- Here we are.
- OK.

360
00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:33.833
- Here.
- Let's go, come on in.

361
00:21:36.791 --> 00:21:38.708
Join me in the room.

362
00:21:40.583 --> 00:21:43.416
Should I put on some music?

363
00:21:43.583 --> 00:21:45.333
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah? OK.

364
00:21:51.458 --> 00:21:52.625
Oh, that's good.

365
00:21:55.125 --> 00:21:56.750
Here you go.

366
00:21:56.916 --> 00:21:59.041
Thank you. Cheers.

367
00:21:59.208 --> 00:22:00.791
- Cheers.
- Drink up.

368
00:22:04.166 --> 00:22:08.291
OK.
So why don't you also remove your shoes

369
00:22:08.458 --> 00:22:11.416
and meet me on the bed?
Get comfortable.

370
00:22:11.583 --> 00:22:13.083
I'll be right back.

371
00:22:13.416 --> 00:22:14.625
I'll do that.

372
00:22:16.625 --> 00:22:17.875
I'll do that.

373
00:24:20.291 --> 00:24:21.625
May I?

374
00:24:26.333 --> 00:24:27.750
Smart girl.

375
00:24:31.208 --> 00:24:34.083
How long have you been Alice Overby?

376
00:24:34.708 --> 00:24:36.333
Or was that just for tonight?

377
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.041
Yeah. It's hard to keep track, Bob.

378
00:24:38.208 --> 00:24:39.541
You know the drill.

379
00:24:41.083 --> 00:24:42.763
- So who are you?
- A kindred spirit.

380
00:24:42.875 --> 00:24:45.000
That simp down there, he a target?

381
00:24:45.666 --> 00:24:46.986
Being that we're kindred spirits,

382
00:24:47.125 --> 00:24:49.666
you can understand why I don't want
to elaborate on that topic.

383
00:24:49.833 --> 00:24:50.833
Fair enough.

384
00:24:50.875 --> 00:24:52.416
Me, I'm an open book.

385
00:24:52.583 --> 00:24:55.623
You see that Panamanian diplomat they
pulled out the East River this morning?

386
00:24:55.708 --> 00:24:56.958
I must have missed that one.

387
00:24:57.125 --> 00:24:58.934
More a headache
than it should have been.

388
00:24:58.958 --> 00:25:00.750
Ruined my favorite shirt.
You can believe it.

389
00:25:00.916 --> 00:25:03.375
So imagine my delight,

390
00:25:03.541 --> 00:25:05.500
when I see the woman across the bar

391
00:25:05.666 --> 00:25:07.416
is a familiar face.

392
00:25:07.583 --> 00:25:08.583
<i>Miss.</i>

393
00:25:08.708 --> 00:25:10.583
<i>Compliments of the gentleman.</i>

394
00:25:11.708 --> 00:25:15.250
<i>And the familiar face
has a very large bounty attached to it.</i>

395
00:25:15.416 --> 00:25:17.333
She kills me this one.

396
00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.125
<i>But I had to be sure.</i>

397
00:25:19.291 --> 00:25:21.750
Why, I stepped away
to take a more careful look

398
00:25:21.916 --> 00:25:24.125
at your photograph on the tip sheet.

399
00:25:24.291 --> 00:25:27.250
Sure enough, there it is.
The one and only

400
00:25:27.416 --> 00:25:28.791
Anna Peller.

401
00:25:30.916 --> 00:25:32.291
Oh, relax.

402
00:25:33.125 --> 00:25:34.750
Relax!

403
00:25:34.916 --> 00:25:36.625
Sovereign doesn't want you dead,

404
00:25:36.791 --> 00:25:40.291
which, come to think of it,
does set the mind reeling.

405
00:25:40.875 --> 00:25:44.166
A hired killer breaks with the world's
leading murder for hire syndicate

406
00:25:44.333 --> 00:25:45.458
and goes off grid.

407
00:25:45.625 --> 00:25:47.833
But I'm not even supposed to kill her.

408
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.958
Gwen Carver
must have a real soft spot for you.

409
00:25:51.125 --> 00:25:52.708
Can we cut to the chase here, Bob?

410
00:25:52.875 --> 00:25:55.458
Well, perhaps us two birds of a feather

411
00:25:55.625 --> 00:25:57.166
could come up with an arrangement.

412
00:25:57.333 --> 00:25:58.875
Hm. And what does that look like?

413
00:25:59.041 --> 00:26:01.333
Sixty percent commission
on any future work.

414
00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:04.083
And you and me,
we keep a line open just between us.

415
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.083
Hm...

416
00:26:06.666 --> 00:26:09.916
I could call our mutual friends
at Sovereign right now.

417
00:26:10.083 --> 00:26:12.541
Send one text
and bring the whole world down

418
00:26:12.708 --> 00:26:13.875
on your head.

419
00:26:14.708 --> 00:26:17.666
And do quite right by my bank account.

420
00:26:20.166 --> 00:26:21.875
So you don't work for Sovereign?

421
00:26:22.333 --> 00:26:24.583
I work for the highest bidder.
I always have.

422
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.500
Twenty.

423
00:26:32.416 --> 00:26:33.500
Fifty.

424
00:26:33.666 --> 00:26:34.666
Twenty-five.

425
00:26:34.708 --> 00:26:38.125
Do not underestimate me
or what I'm capable of.

426
00:26:38.291 --> 00:26:41.750
Sovereign wants you alive, this is true.
But alive is a pretty broad term.

427
00:26:52.125 --> 00:26:53.958
Nothing for you, Bob?

428
00:26:54.125 --> 00:26:57.750
A cyanide on the rocks?
I think I'll pass.

429
00:26:58.166 --> 00:26:59.666
OK. Suit yourself.

430
00:27:02.583 --> 00:27:03.583
There you go.

431
00:27:03.625 --> 00:27:04.791
So what do you think?

432
00:27:04.958 --> 00:27:07.458
You think we're getting closer to a deal?

433
00:27:07.625 --> 00:27:09.000
Forty.

434
00:27:09.916 --> 00:27:12.958
See, I don't think I have 40 percent
to give you.

435
00:27:13.125 --> 00:27:14.666
I already give 30 percent
to the guy

436
00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:17.375
who's supposed to keep guys
like you away from me. So...

437
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:20.083
it's not in the budget.
You feel free to make that call.

438
00:27:21.958 --> 00:27:23.238
Although I don't think you will.

439
00:27:23.375 --> 00:27:25.875
And why,
is it out of the goodness of my heart?

440
00:27:26.041 --> 00:27:27.333
Oh, no, no, no.

441
00:27:27.833 --> 00:27:29.642
Because I already poisoned you
back at the bar.

442
00:27:31.416 --> 00:27:33.666
wha...

443
00:27:33.833 --> 00:27:36.033
You should know I don't leave home
without three things:

444
00:27:37.375 --> 00:27:38.708
My phone,

445
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:42.541
my compact,

446
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.208
and something a little more...

447
00:27:47.125 --> 00:27:48.125
lethal.

448
00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:50.642
Should have warned you.
Bit of a kick, that one. Are you OK?

449
00:27:50.666 --> 00:27:53.000
Oh, yeah. That's why I don't take shots.

450
00:27:53.166 --> 00:27:54.916
Excuse me, can I have a water, please?

451
00:27:55.083 --> 00:27:56.916
To Alice Overby.

452
00:27:57.083 --> 00:27:59.166
And to all the less lucky victims

453
00:27:59.333 --> 00:28:01.500
of her considerable charms.

454
00:28:08.791 --> 00:28:10.434
You should really start
to feel that,

455
00:28:10.458 --> 00:28:12.416
right about...

456
00:28:13.041 --> 00:28:14.041
Now.

457
00:28:16.708 --> 00:28:18.416
Oh, Bob.

458
00:28:18.583 --> 00:28:21.208
My friend. Shots are never a good idea.

459
00:28:21.375 --> 00:28:23.041
No. You took your eyes off your scotch.

460
00:28:24.083 --> 00:28:27.208
I just came up here to make sure
you hadn't called our friends at Sovereign

461
00:28:27.375 --> 00:28:29.416
before you lost your speech.

462
00:28:29.583 --> 00:28:31.166
And your sight.

463
00:28:32.583 --> 00:28:34.041
And the rest.

464
00:28:39.291 --> 00:28:42.041
Bob, Bob, Bob.

465
00:28:42.208 --> 00:28:43.875
Sorry man. Wrong place, wrong time.

466
00:28:44.041 --> 00:28:46.708
I have a family to protect.
I'm sure you understand.

467
00:28:46.875 --> 00:28:47.958
Shit.

468
00:28:51.041 --> 00:28:52.208
Hey, babe. Hi.

469
00:28:52.375 --> 00:28:53.875
Hey, where are you?

470
00:28:54.041 --> 00:28:56.601
Did you get my note? I just ran out
to get aspirin. I'll be right back.

471
00:28:56.625 --> 00:28:57.851
<i>I woke up and you were gone.</i>

472
00:28:57.875 --> 00:28:59.833
Oh no, I'm sorry.
Just going to be a quick thing.

473
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.375
<i>- Can you grab me some too?</i>
- Yeah. No problem.

474
00:29:05.375 --> 00:29:07.041
OK. I'll see you soon.

475
00:29:31.666 --> 00:29:32.708
Great.

476
00:29:43.375 --> 00:29:44.666
Hey.

477
00:29:45.791 --> 00:29:47.958
I can't believe I fell asleep.

478
00:29:48.125 --> 00:29:49.416
Oh...

479
00:29:49.583 --> 00:29:51.000
Oh, no, it's OK.

480
00:29:51.708 --> 00:29:52.750
I'm sorry.

481
00:29:52.916 --> 00:29:54.375
Don't be sorry.

482
00:29:55.541 --> 00:29:58.000
I'm awake now.

483
00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:00.958
How's your head?

484
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.166
It's better now.

485
00:30:33.958 --> 00:30:35.375
Our first dance.

486
00:30:37.541 --> 00:30:39.708
- Must be a sign.
- Yeah...

487
00:30:40.291 --> 00:30:41.458
Must be.

488
00:30:57.875 --> 00:31:01.000
All right, lovebirds.
Enjoy those hangovers.

489
00:31:01.166 --> 00:31:03.500
- Thank you. We love you.
- Love you.

490
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.125
Molly said Coco missed us

491
00:31:08.291 --> 00:31:09.916
and wanted to see us.

492
00:31:10.083 --> 00:31:13.458
I think that's because
he doesn't have enough dog friends.

493
00:31:13.625 --> 00:31:15.333
So if we get a dog,

494
00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.916
Coco wouldn't be lonely anymore.

495
00:31:18.083 --> 00:31:21.291
And our dog could play with Coco
all the time.

496
00:31:21.458 --> 00:31:23.833
Mom is allergic baby.
We've talked about this.

497
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.041
Yeah, no dogs.

498
00:31:25.208 --> 00:31:27.000
But they do have dogs
with no fur, you know?

499
00:31:27.166 --> 00:31:28.642
- We could get one of those.
- No dogs

500
00:31:28.666 --> 00:31:30.958
and no screens at the table, remember?

501
00:31:31.125 --> 00:31:33.458
Well,
how does Mom get to be on the phone?

502
00:31:34.166 --> 00:31:35.458
Naughty mommy.

503
00:31:37.416 --> 00:31:38.416
Hey.

504
00:31:38.916 --> 00:31:41.250
- Are you OK?
- Oh yeah. Sorry.

505
00:31:41.416 --> 00:31:42.958
It's Raj. He's just freaking out.

506
00:31:43.125 --> 00:31:45.845
They're thinking of scrapping
the entire strategy for the East Coast.

507
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.500
I don't know.

508
00:31:47.666 --> 00:31:49.625
And now he's calling me. Babe, I'm sorry.

509
00:31:49.791 --> 00:31:51.291
I'm sorry.

510
00:31:51.875 --> 00:31:53.000
Hey.

511
00:31:56.958 --> 00:31:59.017
<i>You don't text me,
you don't call. I do.</i>

512
00:31:59.041 --> 00:32:00.125
<i>That's what we agreed.</i>

513
00:32:00.291 --> 00:32:02.541
Raj, I'm exposed.

514
00:32:03.541 --> 00:32:04.916
<i>What happened?</i>

515
00:32:05.083 --> 00:32:06.583
Did you see what I sent you?

516
00:32:08.291 --> 00:32:09.916
<i>Oh God, what a mess.</i>

517
00:32:10.083 --> 00:32:11.791
<i>I told you to stay low.</i>

518
00:32:11.958 --> 00:32:13.638
Someone found me.
I had to take care of it.

519
00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:15.791
<i>This is all over the news.</i>

520
00:32:15.958 --> 00:32:18.875
<i>- You're 100 percent on Carver's radar now.</i>
- I'm coming to you.

521
00:32:19.125 --> 00:32:20.500
- Tomorrow.
<i>- No, don't.</i>

522
00:32:20.666 --> 00:32:23.546
<i>If Sovereign's got your scent,
the last place to be is the airport.</i>

523
00:32:27.791 --> 00:32:29.291
Hey, what's up?

524
00:32:29.458 --> 00:32:31.378
<i>Bro, the Royal Grand, right?</i>

525
00:32:31.958 --> 00:32:33.041
What?

526
00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.583
<i>The hotel you were staying at.
It was the Royal Grand?</i>

527
00:32:37.291 --> 00:32:38.666
Yeah. Why?

528
00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:41.541
<i>Texting you a link right now.</i>

529
00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:52.875
<i>Dude, you guys know how to pick a hotel.</i>

530
00:33:02.291 --> 00:33:03.875
Emma!

531
00:33:04.041 --> 00:33:06.208
Police sources say
that the murder took place

532
00:33:06.375 --> 00:33:09.166
somewhere between midnight
and 3 a.m. last night.

533
00:33:09.333 --> 00:33:10.791
Hotel staff discovered the body

534
00:33:10.958 --> 00:33:13.916
when Mr. Kitterman
failed to check out this morning.

535
00:33:14.083 --> 00:33:16.541
No suspects have yet been named
in the investigation.

536
00:33:16.708 --> 00:33:20.083
The police are seeking to identify
a man and woman

537
00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:24.000
seen talking with the victim
at the hotel bar

538
00:33:24.166 --> 00:33:25.833
earlier on the night in question.

539
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:26.833
That's us.

540
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.958
- T-t-that's us!
- Mm-hm.

541
00:33:29.125 --> 00:33:31.250
Police stressed it is early
in the investigation,

542
00:33:31.416 --> 00:33:33.875
but did confirm that the couple
from the bar

543
00:33:34.041 --> 00:33:37.166
are currently considered
persons of interest in the case.

544
00:33:37.333 --> 00:33:38.583
That is one hundred percent us.

545
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:41.333
We are the man and woman
from the hotel bar.

546
00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:42.916
We are the persons of interest.

547
00:33:43.083 --> 00:33:44.916
Sure there are no pictures on there?

548
00:33:46.375 --> 00:33:48.083
- No, none.
- OK.

549
00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:50.458
Um... We have to call. Right?

550
00:33:51.083 --> 00:33:53.476
Is-is there even a number?
How would we call them?

551
00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.250
There is. There is. Should I call?

552
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:57.726
- What do we tell them?
- What do we tell them about what?

553
00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:59.333
Why we're not who we say we are?

554
00:34:00.958 --> 00:34:03.708
Right... The fake names!

555
00:34:03.875 --> 00:34:06.458
- I was wearing a fucking wig, Dave.
- Oh, shit!

556
00:34:07.291 --> 00:34:08.458
OK, OK...

557
00:34:09.833 --> 00:34:12.250
We may not have been the only ones
he talked to at the bar.

558
00:34:12.416 --> 00:34:13.791
We did shots with him, Dave.

559
00:34:14.541 --> 00:34:15.625
We did shots...

560
00:34:16.125 --> 00:34:18.083
Damn it! Why did we do shots?

561
00:34:19.041 --> 00:34:21.125
OK, we wait.

562
00:34:22.416 --> 00:34:24.916
We wait.
OK. It's not like we know anything.

563
00:34:25.083 --> 00:34:27.625
Right? We'll see. We'll see...

564
00:34:28.333 --> 00:34:30.166
Maybe... maybe someone comes forward.

565
00:34:30.333 --> 00:34:33.541
Maybe they catch the person who did it.

566
00:34:33.708 --> 00:34:34.541
We wait and see.

567
00:34:34.708 --> 00:34:36.625
Yes, we wait and see. Good.

568
00:34:36.791 --> 00:34:38.375
They don't even know who we are.

569
00:34:38.541 --> 00:34:41.375
- Kitterman picked up the tab, so...
- Right. Right.

570
00:34:41.541 --> 00:34:42.916
- We wait.
- Yeah.

571
00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:44.916
Looks kinda... yeah.

572
00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.291
- Is that crazy?
- Um...

573
00:34:47.458 --> 00:34:51.666
It just doesn't look good.
I mean, the names, the wig, the shots...

574
00:34:52.333 --> 00:34:53.583
No, it doesn't look good.

575
00:34:54.083 --> 00:34:55.083
Uh huh.

576
00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:57.916
- Oh my God.
- Hey, hey, hey.

577
00:34:58.916 --> 00:35:00.236
- It's going to be OK.
- Yeah. No.

578
00:35:00.375 --> 00:35:03.351
Everything is happening all at once,
and it's all coming down at the same time.

579
00:35:03.375 --> 00:35:05.083
And I just. That call I just had with Raj

580
00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:06.770
and now they need me in Boise tomorrow

581
00:35:06.916 --> 00:35:08.166
instead of next month.

582
00:35:08.333 --> 00:35:10.453
So I figured out
this flight for the morning, and I...

583
00:35:11.208 --> 00:35:12.848
- But you just got back!
- I know, I know.

584
00:35:12.875 --> 00:35:14.041
It's just for one meeting.

585
00:35:14.458 --> 00:35:17.226
I'll be back Monday, and maybe
if they haven't figured this out by then,

586
00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:18.416
we'll call. We'll call then.

587
00:35:18.583 --> 00:35:20.750
OK, yeah. That's good. Yeah...

588
00:35:20.916 --> 00:35:23.250
Yeah, all right. We'll call then.

589
00:35:23.958 --> 00:35:26.291
Boise?
Can't you do a Zoom?

590
00:35:26.458 --> 00:35:27.458
No.

591
00:35:27.583 --> 00:35:29.543
It has to be in person, sorry.
It has to be quick.

592
00:35:29.625 --> 00:35:31.958
OK. OK. We're gonna be OK.

593
00:35:32.125 --> 00:35:34.708
We're gonna be OK.

594
00:36:08.291 --> 00:36:10.083
- Car's here.
- OK.

595
00:36:16.458 --> 00:36:18.625
Hey. Go easy on your old man, OK?

596
00:36:18.791 --> 00:36:20.833
- Sure, Mom.
- I'm going to miss you.

597
00:36:25.375 --> 00:36:26.958
Baby girl. Hi.

598
00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:30.125
When are you coming home?

599
00:36:30.291 --> 00:36:32.208
You won't even notice I'm gone.

600
00:36:32.375 --> 00:36:34.583
I already notice that you're gone.

601
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:37.916
OK.

602
00:36:38.583 --> 00:36:41.041
- I love you.
- I love you too.

603
00:36:41.208 --> 00:36:43.000
I know, God. OK, baby.

604
00:36:43.166 --> 00:36:44.916
I gotta go. I gotta go.

605
00:36:50.958 --> 00:36:55.333
OK, um... Hey, don't forget
Wyatt starts his second vitamins tomorrow

606
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.583
and Car's new pick up time is...

607
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:59.291
At four, not five.

608
00:37:00.208 --> 00:37:02.083
- I love you.
- Love you too.

609
00:37:03.958 --> 00:37:06.291
- I'll call when I can.
- Fly safe.

610
00:37:08.291 --> 00:37:11.083
OK. I'm gonna come get you at the airport.

611
00:37:12.708 --> 00:37:14.041
Yeah.

612
00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:15.541
All right.

613
00:37:15.708 --> 00:37:16.791
OK.

614
00:37:19.541 --> 00:37:20.583
Love you.

615
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.041
Love you.

616
00:37:30.333 --> 00:37:31.791
Which terminal?

617
00:37:33.125 --> 00:37:34.291
International.

618
00:37:50.583 --> 00:37:54.333
<i>That ten percent uptake
in Portland in Austin by November.</i>

619
00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:58.375
<i>But if we manage to land the equal
market demo space at South By,</i>

620
00:37:58.541 --> 00:38:00.458
<i>that could be a game changer...</i>

621
00:38:01.791 --> 00:38:04.500
Now. I'll throw it over to Dave. Dave!

622
00:38:06.583 --> 00:38:12.125
Yes, it's very exciting.
As Kevin was saying...

623
00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:30.370
<i>Hey it's Emma. Leave a message.</i>

624
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:47.809
<i>She says she's missing
the pink water bottle from the backpack.</i>

625
00:38:47.833 --> 00:38:50.708
Molly, I'm sure she'll survive.

626
00:38:50.875 --> 00:38:53.708
I can't talk pink water bottles right now.
I'm at the airport.

627
00:38:53.875 --> 00:38:56.125
<i>I'm just telling you what she told me.</i>

628
00:38:56.291 --> 00:38:59.625
- I'll call you as soon as I get Emma. OK?
<i>- All right.</i>

629
00:39:14.875 --> 00:39:16.995
<i>Hey it's Emma. Leave a message.</i>

630
00:39:24.208 --> 00:39:26.916
I need you to check again.
It's Emma. Emma Brackett.

631
00:39:27.083 --> 00:39:30.291
It's the flight from Boise.
The 702 from Boise.

632
00:39:33.666 --> 00:39:35.875
<i>Hey it's Emma. Leave a message.</i>

633
00:39:36.041 --> 00:39:38.083
I do have an Emmy Wu.
Is she Emmy Wu?

634
00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:39.750
No, she's not.

635
00:39:40.125 --> 00:39:42.245
<i>Hey it's Emma. Leave a message.</i>

636
00:39:44.125 --> 00:39:46.416
Maybe it's the spelling. Try Emma

637
00:39:46.583 --> 00:39:47.708
B, R, A...

638
00:39:47.875 --> 00:39:49.250
Sir, I already searched.

639
00:39:49.416 --> 00:39:52.208
and there's nothing else I can do.

640
00:39:52.375 --> 00:39:53.458
...T.

641
00:40:15.916 --> 00:40:17.875
Dave Brackett?

642
00:40:18.041 --> 00:40:21.208
Detective Tobi Berman,
NYPD Homicide.

643
00:40:21.375 --> 00:40:23.041
That's my partner.
Detective Karen Shah.

644
00:40:23.208 --> 00:40:25.083
You got a few minutes?

645
00:40:28.166 --> 00:40:32.125
I know, I know. We were going to call
when she got back.

646
00:40:32.291 --> 00:40:33.583
And your wife ain't back.

647
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:36.958
Yes. So you should be calling the police
in Boise, right?

648
00:40:37.125 --> 00:40:40.165
Yeah, you can bet we're gonna get on that,
Dave. Right after we're done here.

649
00:40:40.291 --> 00:40:41.809
Look, am I being accused of something?

650
00:40:41.833 --> 00:40:44.166
Do you feel like you're being accused
of something?

651
00:40:44.333 --> 00:40:47.125
Well, I feel like...
I feel like maybe I should...

652
00:40:47.291 --> 00:40:48.891
I feel like maybe
I should have a lawyer.

653
00:40:48.916 --> 00:40:51.000
Do you have a lawyer, Dave?

654
00:40:51.833 --> 00:40:54.500
I have a guy who drew up paperwork
for us for the house.

655
00:40:54.666 --> 00:40:56.306
Why do you want to call the guy?

656
00:40:56.833 --> 00:40:58.500
Did the paperwork for the house

657
00:40:58.666 --> 00:41:00.375
like your real estate agent?

658
00:41:00.541 --> 00:41:02.059
Or we can call someone for you.

659
00:41:02.083 --> 00:41:03.916
Look, I'm not trying to be difficult.

660
00:41:04.083 --> 00:41:05.666
I don't think you're being difficult.

661
00:41:05.833 --> 00:41:07.708
I think maybe you're nervous.

662
00:41:07.875 --> 00:41:09.375
No, I'm not. I'm not nervous.

663
00:41:09.541 --> 00:41:11.083
It's normal to be nervous.

664
00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:13.083
We're just looking for information.

665
00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:14.500
Sure.

666
00:41:14.666 --> 00:41:16.500
Now do you want to wait for that lawyer?

667
00:41:16.666 --> 00:41:19.306
Or do you want to keep talking
about that night at the Royal Grand?

668
00:41:19.375 --> 00:41:22.583
OK. OK. Yeah.
So it was our anniversary Thursday.

669
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:24.916
How did you and your wife
know Mr. Kitterman?

670
00:41:25.416 --> 00:41:27.958
We didn't. We didn't!

671
00:41:28.125 --> 00:41:30.083
I was late to meet her

672
00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:31.541
at the bar.

673
00:41:31.708 --> 00:41:34.625
I guess he had started chatting her up.

674
00:41:34.791 --> 00:41:38.583
And when I...
Look, I think he'd had a few.

675
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:42.333
And were you using an assumed name
that night at the hotel, Mr. Brackett?

676
00:41:44.208 --> 00:41:45.625
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What?

677
00:41:45.791 --> 00:41:48.625
You were using an assumed name
that night at the hotel.

678
00:41:50.375 --> 00:41:51.375
Um...

679
00:41:52.875 --> 00:41:54.333
I...

680
00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:57.958
OK, look. This looks pretty bad. I know.

681
00:41:58.125 --> 00:42:00.291
Um...
Honestly, it's just a little embarrassing.

682
00:42:01.375 --> 00:42:03.500
See, my wife and I, we were...

683
00:42:03.666 --> 00:42:08.333
We were playing a game,
you know, like a kind of like a...

684
00:42:09.541 --> 00:42:11.125
Like a role play.

685
00:42:11.291 --> 00:42:14.708
Just like a game, you know, or whatnot.

686
00:42:14.875 --> 00:42:18.250
And in the interest of excitement
and whatnot, we...

687
00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:21.333
we use different names.

688
00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:23.000
And um...

689
00:42:23.916 --> 00:42:28.208
It was just to spice things up
a little bit, you know? You know.

690
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.250
Do you and your wife

691
00:42:34.416 --> 00:42:36.333
role play often, Mr. Brackett?

692
00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.708
No! No.

693
00:42:38.875 --> 00:42:40.666
It was the first time.

694
00:42:45.041 --> 00:42:48.333
Mr. Brackett,
this is Special Agent Carver with ITIC.

695
00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.060
She'll be joining us,
if you don't mind.

696
00:42:50.208 --> 00:42:53.583
She's part of a task force
helping in this investigation.

697
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:56.916
Nice to meet you, Mr. Brackett.
Please continue.

698
00:42:59.458 --> 00:43:02.375
Mr. Brackett, how long have you
and your wife been married?

699
00:43:02.958 --> 00:43:04.916
Seven years as of Thursday.

700
00:43:05.083 --> 00:43:07.458
- And you have two children?
- Yes.

701
00:43:07.625 --> 00:43:09.291
Wyatt is ten. Caroline, six.

702
00:43:09.458 --> 00:43:11.708
Wyatt's my son from a previous marriage.

703
00:43:11.875 --> 00:43:13.833
Emma has been his mom
for a long time now.

704
00:43:16.083 --> 00:43:17.666
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but...

705
00:43:17.833 --> 00:43:20.833
What is it? What exactly is this about?

706
00:43:32.666 --> 00:43:34.625
Is this woman your wife,
Mr. Brackett?

707
00:43:35.625 --> 00:43:36.791
No.

708
00:43:36.958 --> 00:43:38.916
Her name is Emma Rayburn.

709
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:42.666
That's Emma's name. Maiden name.

710
00:43:42.833 --> 00:43:45.541
No. This woman is Emma Jay Rayburn.

711
00:43:46.083 --> 00:43:48.958
Thirty-three years old.
Five foot seven, hazel eyes.

712
00:43:49.125 --> 00:43:52.916
Social security number: 174631503.

713
00:43:53.083 --> 00:43:54.291
What are you telling me?

714
00:43:56.333 --> 00:43:59.291
Mr. Brackett, Emma Rayburn died
eight years ago.

715
00:43:59.875 --> 00:44:02.875
You met your wife about eight years ago.
Is that right?

716
00:44:11.666 --> 00:44:12.916
- Dave?
- Huh?

717
00:44:13.083 --> 00:44:16.375
I'm going to show you some photographs
of my own, if that's all right.

718
00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:20.791
This is from Buenos Aires Airport,

719
00:44:20.958 --> 00:44:23.500
Argentina, last Wednesday.

720
00:44:24.583 --> 00:44:29.000
Four hours before this picture was taken,
a local union leader was found murdered.

721
00:44:29.916 --> 00:44:32.916
A woman matching this description
was seen leaving the crime scene.

722
00:44:33.083 --> 00:44:35.083
Yeah, but she was in Nebraska.

723
00:44:35.833 --> 00:44:36.833
So...

724
00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:40.958
The man at the hotel, Robert Kitterman,

725
00:44:41.125 --> 00:44:44.125
we believe that's an alias used
by this man, Derrick Worley,

726
00:44:44.708 --> 00:44:48.791
a contract killer responsible
for more than 30 murders internationally.

727
00:44:52.333 --> 00:44:53.791
This is Rajendra Bakshi.

728
00:44:56.791 --> 00:44:58.958
That's my wife's supervisor. Raj.

729
00:44:59.541 --> 00:45:02.083
He's a black marketeer
working the dark web.

730
00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:06.166
Born in Chennai, raised in the UK,
operating out of Berlin.

731
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.708
He serves as her handler.

732
00:45:12.125 --> 00:45:13.416
Her handler?

733
00:45:13.583 --> 00:45:15.583
This is not gonna be easy,
Mr. Brackett,

734
00:45:17.166 --> 00:45:18.291
but...

735
00:45:19.208 --> 00:45:20.708
your wife's real name

736
00:45:20.875 --> 00:45:22.458
is Anna Peller.

737
00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:25.708
Wanted for contract killings across
several continents.

738
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:28.791
We need you to help us find her.

739
00:45:31.375 --> 00:45:33.083
I'm sorry.

740
00:45:34.666 --> 00:45:36.500
I'm sorry.

741
00:45:43.083 --> 00:45:44.791
What the...

742
00:45:48.416 --> 00:45:49.833
What?

743
00:47:16.541 --> 00:47:17.666
What...

744
00:47:37.916 --> 00:47:39.000
Oh...

745
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:41.125
Agent Carver.

746
00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:43.916
Mr. Bracket. Glad we caught you at home.

747
00:47:44.083 --> 00:47:48.333
This is my associate at the agency.
Agent Ji.

748
00:47:48.583 --> 00:47:49.583
Hi. Hey...

749
00:47:50.458 --> 00:47:51.541
I'm Dave.

750
00:47:52.166 --> 00:47:54.458
Would it be possible
to have a moment of your time?

751
00:47:55.416 --> 00:47:57.958
Oh... What is it I can help you with?

752
00:48:00.958 --> 00:48:02.708
Well, um...

753
00:48:03.208 --> 00:48:05.416
This might be a bit awkward out here.

754
00:48:10.041 --> 00:48:11.500
There she is.

755
00:48:13.791 --> 00:48:15.375
You have a lovely family.

756
00:48:15.916 --> 00:48:17.083
Thank you.

757
00:48:17.583 --> 00:48:20.458
Wyatt, and um...

758
00:48:21.375 --> 00:48:22.583
Caroline.

759
00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:23.791
Mm-hm.

760
00:48:23.958 --> 00:48:25.708
Mind if we keep this?

761
00:48:26.041 --> 00:48:27.166
We'll get it back to you.

762
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:35.958
<i>Danke.</i>

763
00:48:37.875 --> 00:48:39.458
Taxi! Taxi!

764
00:48:56.666 --> 00:48:57.916
You look terrible.

765
00:48:58.083 --> 00:48:59.916
Yeah, it was a very long flight.

766
00:49:00.083 --> 00:49:01.708
Three flights in fact.

767
00:49:01.875 --> 00:49:03.275
You shouldn't have come here.

768
00:49:03.333 --> 00:49:04.916
- It's not safe.
- Oh, OK.

769
00:49:05.083 --> 00:49:06.833
Then drive the damn car.

770
00:49:11.375 --> 00:49:13.055
What can I do for you,
Agent Carver?

771
00:49:13.083 --> 00:49:16.000
It's really more
about what we can do for you.

772
00:49:18.291 --> 00:49:19.333
How's that?

773
00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:21.333
You must have concerns

774
00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:23.333
for the safety of your family.

775
00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:24.916
And I think

776
00:49:25.416 --> 00:49:27.583
your feelings about your wife

777
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:30.041
must be complicated right now,

778
00:49:30.708 --> 00:49:32.208
to say the least.

779
00:49:32.375 --> 00:49:34.791
But I want you to know
that I will do anything in my power

780
00:49:34.958 --> 00:49:36.041
to bring her back.

781
00:49:37.416 --> 00:49:38.416
Thanks.

782
00:49:38.458 --> 00:49:40.818
Look, I fucked up in New York.
I get that, we make mistakes.

783
00:49:40.958 --> 00:49:43.434
It happens to the best of us.
But why was there heat on me at first?

784
00:49:43.458 --> 00:49:45.418
Actually, no.
It doesn't happen to the best of us.

785
00:49:45.583 --> 00:49:48.500
I can't protect you if you're out there
murdering sovereign reps.

786
00:49:48.666 --> 00:49:50.706
He wasn't Sovereign.
He just had them on speed dial.

787
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:52.041
Why was there heat on me?

788
00:49:52.208 --> 00:49:55.666
There's always heat. Don't you get it?
She's never gonna to let you go.

789
00:49:56.541 --> 00:49:58.083
Emma is a threat.

790
00:49:58.791 --> 00:50:00.041
A dangerous one.

791
00:50:00.625 --> 00:50:02.625
Maybe most dangerous to herself.

792
00:50:04.458 --> 00:50:05.500
Dave,

793
00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:09.041
I understand your loyalty to your wife,

794
00:50:09.916 --> 00:50:11.583
but it is crucial

795
00:50:12.083 --> 00:50:13.208
right now

796
00:50:13.375 --> 00:50:16.791
that I search your house for evidence
to help us locate her.

797
00:50:19.458 --> 00:50:22.583
Sorry to ask, but um...

798
00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:25.375
don't you need...

799
00:50:26.166 --> 00:50:28.541
don't you need a warrant for that?

800
00:50:33.041 --> 00:50:35.684
Oh, you sure you don't want
to hand me in and take the reward?

801
00:50:35.708 --> 00:50:36.708
Very funny.

802
00:50:36.875 --> 00:50:39.515
If I wanted to hand you over,
I could have done it a long time ago.

803
00:50:39.583 --> 00:50:41.000
Oh yeah?

804
00:50:41.166 --> 00:50:43.166
Do you have any idea what I do for you?

805
00:50:43.833 --> 00:50:45.375
What you do for me?

806
00:50:45.541 --> 00:50:47.000
Last I checked,

807
00:50:47.166 --> 00:50:49.125
I do the dirty work, and you get paid.

808
00:50:49.291 --> 00:50:51.166
I keep you underground.

809
00:50:51.333 --> 00:50:52.666
Yeah well...

810
00:50:52.833 --> 00:50:55.416
that's not exactly going as planned.

811
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:59.791
Your wife, Emma, is a role
played by a criminal

812
00:50:59.958 --> 00:51:01.750
named Anna Peller.

813
00:51:02.458 --> 00:51:04.041
She played you.

814
00:51:05.833 --> 00:51:07.375
Don't let her play you anymore.

815
00:51:07.541 --> 00:51:10.041
You've been on the tip sheet
since the sighting in Tel Aviv.

816
00:51:10.208 --> 00:51:11.291
You know that.

817
00:51:11.458 --> 00:51:14.500
The last thing you should be doing
is trolling luxury hotels in Manhattan.

818
00:51:16.416 --> 00:51:19.041
I forgot our fucking anniversary.

819
00:51:19.208 --> 00:51:23.333
She is incapable of love or compassion.

820
00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:27.708
She is a cold-blooded killer

821
00:51:28.958 --> 00:51:31.625
who lied to you
and endangered your children.

822
00:51:32.375 --> 00:51:33.791
It's not just New York.

823
00:51:33.958 --> 00:51:35.851
Your head isn't in the game
and I know that before.

824
00:51:35.875 --> 00:51:38.333
Yeah, well, I told you I need out.
Do you have them?

825
00:51:43.875 --> 00:51:45.625
Kids too?

826
00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:48.916
Good. Good.

827
00:51:50.333 --> 00:51:51.375
Dave,

828
00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:53.166
I'm going to ask you one more time.

829
00:51:54.083 --> 00:51:56.333
Might I take a look around?

830
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.041
I've done what I can
to protect your little fantasy

831
00:52:01.208 --> 00:52:02.708
but it's time to wake up, Emma.

832
00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:04.291
Um...

833
00:52:05.541 --> 00:52:07.875
Time to say goodbye
to your perfect little family.

834
00:52:08.041 --> 00:52:10.958
I told you, I'm getting them out
and then I'm done with all this shit.

835
00:52:11.125 --> 00:52:14.625
She is a cold-blooded murderer.

836
00:52:15.375 --> 00:52:16.575
Until the money runs out

837
00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:18.583
or they pick up your scent.

838
00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:20.541
And I'm not there to help you.

839
00:52:30.083 --> 00:52:33.375
Black G-wagon about three cars back.
It's Sovereign.

840
00:52:37.041 --> 00:52:39.958
Pull up over here. Just pull over!

841
00:52:52.833 --> 00:52:54.958
Um... Mr. Brackett,

842
00:52:55.125 --> 00:52:57.605
I'm very sorry. We're going
to have to continue this discussion

843
00:52:57.708 --> 00:52:59.083
at a later date.

844
00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:00.583
We will be in touch.

845
00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:02.791
And thank you very much for your time.

846
00:53:03.583 --> 00:53:05.083
Yeah, sure.

847
00:53:19.958 --> 00:53:22.208
You can't run away from her forever, Anna.

848
00:53:22.375 --> 00:53:23.500
Bye.

849
00:53:53.041 --> 00:53:54.166
Watch the back.

850
00:53:54.333 --> 00:53:56.083
I got the back.

851
00:54:24.375 --> 00:54:25.375
Do you see her?

852
00:54:25.416 --> 00:54:26.416
Negative.

853
00:54:43.625 --> 00:54:44.791
Whoa!

854
00:56:19.208 --> 00:56:20.708
Sleep tight.

855
00:56:31.041 --> 00:56:32.833
Emma! Here!

856
00:56:35.791 --> 00:56:37.231
Get in!

857
00:56:39.458 --> 00:56:41.000
<i>Scheisse!</i>

858
00:56:45.875 --> 00:56:47.291
Now. Go!

859
00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:56.000
Hey, you OK?

860
00:56:56.166 --> 00:56:58.291
Whoa, Raj, are you OK?

861
00:56:58.458 --> 00:56:59.541
Shit, shit!

862
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:02.750
Go.

863
00:57:06.083 --> 00:57:08.083
Get your foot off the gas!

864
00:57:13.791 --> 00:57:14.791
Oh shit, shit!

865
00:57:16.291 --> 00:57:18.000
Shit, shit, shit!

866
00:57:23.083 --> 00:57:23.916
Raj!

867
00:57:34.458 --> 00:57:36.041
Oh my God.

868
00:57:44.625 --> 00:57:46.458
Shit!

869
00:57:47.041 --> 00:57:48.416
Shit!

870
00:58:02.666 --> 00:58:04.916
<i>We're sorry.</i>

871
00:58:05.083 --> 00:58:08.458
<i>Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
Please check the number and...</i>

872
00:58:19.458 --> 00:58:23.541
<i>Lo sientimos. El numero marcado no existe.</i>

873
00:58:34.666 --> 00:58:36.791
Oh my God.

874
00:59:17.166 --> 00:59:18.375
Emma?

875
00:59:21.958 --> 00:59:22.958
<i>Em?</i>

876
00:59:30.708 --> 00:59:32.166
<i>Are you alone?</i>

877
00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:34.916
Yeah, I'm alone.

878
00:59:36.041 --> 00:59:37.583
<i>How'd you get this number?</i>

879
00:59:38.083 --> 00:59:39.416
How did I get this number?

880
00:59:40.291 --> 00:59:41.691
- Dave...
<i>- I got this number</i>

881
00:59:41.833 --> 00:59:43.473
on the business card of a German plumber,

882
00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:45.260
which was in a box
of my wife's murder things

883
00:59:45.416 --> 00:59:46.708
<i>in the attic!</i>

884
00:59:46.875 --> 00:59:49.791
<i>- Who the fuck are you?</i>
- OK. Are you in the house?

885
00:59:50.458 --> 00:59:51.708
- Yes.
- Kids?

886
00:59:51.875 --> 00:59:53.833
<i>At school. Molly's picking them up.</i>

887
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.333
Dave, walk outside.

888
00:59:56.458 --> 00:59:58.291
What? Walk outside?

889
00:59:58.458 --> 00:59:59.291
Why?

890
00:59:59.458 --> 01:00:01.291
Dave, get out of the house now.

891
01:00:11.333 --> 01:00:12.708
I'm away from the house.

892
01:00:14.458 --> 01:00:16.250
Dave, I'm so sorry.

893
01:00:16.416 --> 01:00:17.708
Sorry.

894
01:00:18.833 --> 01:00:20.666
Sorry for what?

895
01:00:20.833 --> 01:00:24.333
For leaving us?
For lying to us? To me?

896
01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:25.980
<i>I don't even know who you are.</i>

897
01:00:26.125 --> 01:00:28.208
Yes, you do. I am Emma. I am your wife.

898
01:00:28.833 --> 01:00:29.875
But you're not.

899
01:00:30.041 --> 01:00:31.750
They told me what you are.

900
01:00:31.916 --> 01:00:34.041
I had to sit there in that room,

901
01:00:34.833 --> 01:00:37.166
not knowing whether you were alive
or dead.

902
01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:41.375
<i>Listening to this woman tell me
that my wife, my wife,</i>

903
01:00:41.541 --> 01:00:45.208
my everything is not who she claims to be.

904
01:00:47.125 --> 01:00:49.250
My wife is a killer.

905
01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:52.375
An a-assassin.

906
01:00:54.541 --> 01:00:56.208
Emma, is it true?

907
01:01:04.791 --> 01:01:05.958
Em?

908
01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:11.000
Oh, geez.

909
01:01:11.416 --> 01:01:12.791
OK, listen to me. Yes, I lied.

910
01:01:12.958 --> 01:01:14.918
I lied about what I do,
but I never lied about us.

911
01:01:15.083 --> 01:01:17.625
- We have children!
<i>- I know, I know. I know.</i>

912
01:01:24.166 --> 01:01:25.958
The funny thing, Em,

913
01:01:26.833 --> 01:01:28.500
about when they told me.

914
01:01:29.791 --> 01:01:33.333
A part of me was relieved.
Relieved that finally I knew,

915
01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:36.125
I knew what it was,
what you were keeping from me.

916
01:01:36.291 --> 01:01:38.125
<i>That you hadn't fell out love with me.</i>

917
01:01:38.291 --> 01:01:40.791
Dave, I never fell out of love with you.

918
01:01:40.958 --> 01:01:44.375
And I never fell out of love with you.
I don't think I could if I wanted to.

919
01:01:44.541 --> 01:01:47.458
And right now, I really, really want to.

920
01:01:51.916 --> 01:01:52.750
<i>OK.</i>

921
01:01:52.916 --> 01:01:55.791
We're in this together no matter what.

922
01:01:55.958 --> 01:01:59.000
Listen, this is my mess, not yours.
I need to fix this, OK?

923
01:02:01.791 --> 01:02:04.916
This number. You're in Berlin?

924
01:02:05.416 --> 01:02:08.291
Dave, listen to me. Listen to me.
I am going to tell you everything.

925
01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:10.666
I promise. OK? But I need...
I need time.

926
01:02:10.833 --> 01:02:12.583
Do not contact me.
I'm going to contact you.

927
01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:15.125
Uh-uh, that's not how this works.

928
01:02:15.291 --> 01:02:17.041
Are you in Berlin, Emma?

929
01:02:17.208 --> 01:02:19.166
Don't! Dave don't, Dave don't. Don't.

930
01:02:19.333 --> 01:02:21.791
You are my wife. I am coming there.

931
01:02:21.958 --> 01:02:23.625
We are going to deal with it.

932
01:02:23.791 --> 01:02:26.500
Dave, do not come to Berlin.
Do you hear me?

933
01:02:26.666 --> 01:02:29.083
<i>You can't come here, can you?</i>

934
01:02:29.625 --> 01:02:31.791
So I'm coming to Berlin

935
01:02:31.958 --> 01:02:33.583
and we're going to have a conversation.

936
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:35.392
Dave, do not come to Berlin.
Do you hear me?

937
01:02:35.416 --> 01:02:37.208
Do not come to Berlin!
I will not be here!

938
01:02:38.708 --> 01:02:40.875
<i>Dave, do you understand me?</i>

939
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.083
<i>Dave!</i>

940
01:02:52.541 --> 01:02:54.250
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

941
01:03:04.041 --> 01:03:06.625
Em, I just landed in Berlin.

942
01:03:06.791 --> 01:03:08.625
I need you to call me back.

943
01:03:26.791 --> 01:03:29.625
I'm sorry, are you with...

944
01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:31.958
Jack Dawson?

945
01:03:34.458 --> 01:03:35.625
Yeah.

946
01:03:36.208 --> 01:03:37.708
That's me.

947
01:04:20.583 --> 01:04:22.458
Something to drink?

948
01:04:23.041 --> 01:04:25.291
Yeah um... Diet Coke?

949
01:04:26.291 --> 01:04:27.833
Coke light.

950
01:04:35.041 --> 01:04:36.208
Thank you.

951
01:04:42.583 --> 01:04:44.434
<i>What do you want to drink?</i>

952
01:04:44.458 --> 01:04:45.625
<i>Coffee, please. Black.</i>

953
01:04:46.333 --> 01:04:47.541
<i>Sure.</i>

954
01:05:17.916 --> 01:05:19.208
This is a lot.

955
01:05:23.125 --> 01:05:24.291
Where are the kids?

956
01:05:26.375 --> 01:05:27.541
With Molly.

957
01:05:27.958 --> 01:05:29.333
She must hate us.

958
01:05:29.958 --> 01:05:30.958
She does.

959
01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:36.833
My name is Anna.

960
01:05:37.958 --> 01:05:39.000
I kill people for money.

961
01:05:40.333 --> 01:05:42.434
There was something
I was trying to do a long time ago.

962
01:05:42.458 --> 01:05:43.666
You kill people?

963
01:05:44.625 --> 01:05:46.708
<i>Here's your coffee.</i>

964
01:05:46.875 --> 01:05:47.708
<i>Danke.</i>

965
01:05:47.875 --> 01:05:50.458
So, what? Were we y-your cover?

966
01:05:50.625 --> 01:05:51.958
No. No. Never.

967
01:05:52.125 --> 01:05:55.083
- You just left us!
- I didn't leave you, OK?

968
01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:56.458
I needed to...

969
01:05:56.875 --> 01:05:58.708
I needed to make arrangements.

970
01:06:08.250 --> 01:06:09.500
We're Canadian?

971
01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:12.583
Was there anything
that you have ever said to me

972
01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:14.125
that was the truth?

973
01:06:14.958 --> 01:06:16.416
Your parents?

974
01:06:16.833 --> 01:06:19.250
Your aunt in San Diego?

975
01:06:28.333 --> 01:06:29.791
I was born in the States.

976
01:06:31.083 --> 01:06:32.443
My dad was a Secret Service agent,

977
01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:35.208
turned ex-Secret Service agent
way before he would have liked.

978
01:06:35.375 --> 01:06:37.250
So he went into business for himself,

979
01:06:37.708 --> 01:06:40.708
started a private security company
named Sovereign.

980
01:06:40.875 --> 01:06:43.041
With an intelligence agent
named Gwen Carver.

981
01:06:43.208 --> 01:06:47.416
Gwen Carver is investigating you.
Some kind of international task force.

982
01:06:47.583 --> 01:06:49.791
There is no task force,
that's Sovereign.

983
01:06:49.958 --> 01:06:52.250
All the more reach,
more cover, the better.

984
01:06:53.458 --> 01:06:55.291
Now that my dad is killed,
she took me in.

985
01:06:55.458 --> 01:06:58.708
You know,
she gave me a life. She trained me.

986
01:06:59.333 --> 01:07:00.813
She told me they were all bad people.

987
01:07:00.875 --> 01:07:03.333
I was so young and she manipulated me.

988
01:07:03.833 --> 01:07:05.625
I know now that she was lying.

989
01:07:06.375 --> 01:07:08.375
I probably knew back then.
I just didn't want to...

990
01:07:08.625 --> 01:07:10.041
admit it to myself.

991
01:07:10.833 --> 01:07:12.333
Anyway, I did a job in Boston.

992
01:07:13.166 --> 01:07:15.125
That's when I met you in that bar.

993
01:07:16.750 --> 01:07:19.125
You talked to me like I was a real person.

994
01:07:19.458 --> 01:07:22.458
You made me laugh.
You made me want to start a new life.

995
01:07:23.291 --> 01:07:25.291
You were never my cover, Dave.

996
01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:29.666
You were the first person
I ever truly loved. Wyatt was the second.

997
01:07:29.833 --> 01:07:32.434
It was the most magical, warmest life
I ever could have dreamed of.

998
01:07:32.458 --> 01:07:34.500
A life I never even thought I could have.

999
01:07:34.916 --> 01:07:37.750
I got pregnant, and there was Caroline.
It was like this perfect life.

1000
01:07:37.916 --> 01:07:39.166
But you never stopped!

1001
01:07:39.333 --> 01:07:41.750
It was only once or twice a year
at first, I swear.

1002
01:07:41.916 --> 01:07:43.791
It was to fund our protection.

1003
01:07:44.583 --> 01:07:45.708
The work trips.

1004
01:07:46.916 --> 01:07:47.916
Nebraska?

1005
01:07:49.166 --> 01:07:50.166
Buenos Aires.

1006
01:07:51.208 --> 01:07:52.333
St. Louis?

1007
01:07:54.166 --> 01:07:55.375
Riyad, I think.

1008
01:07:56.750 --> 01:08:00.041
Dave it's my job, OK? It's what I do.

1009
01:08:00.208 --> 01:08:02.666
- I don't know how to do anything else.
- Then take a class!

1010
01:08:02.833 --> 01:08:04.673
I know, you're right.
I should do that, I know.

1011
01:08:05.333 --> 01:08:07.809
I'm going to. Listen, it's done.
I don't want to do this anymore.

1012
01:08:07.833 --> 01:08:08.993
Dave, look at me. I miss you.

1013
01:08:09.083 --> 01:08:10.916
I miss doing the crossword puzzle
together.

1014
01:08:11.083 --> 01:08:13.875
I miss sitting on the couch
watching Pixar movies with the kids,

1015
01:08:14.041 --> 01:08:15.666
throwing candy in the popcorn.

1016
01:08:16.083 --> 01:08:17.559
I miss having sex with you in our bed

1017
01:08:17.583 --> 01:08:19.309
before we had to schedule it
on the calendar.

1018
01:08:19.333 --> 01:08:20.500
OK...

1019
01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:34.208
- I love you.
- I know. I love you too.

1020
01:08:34.375 --> 01:08:35.916
I love our family.

1021
01:08:37.541 --> 01:08:38.833
But killing is bad.

1022
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.500
Like, unacceptably bad.

1023
01:08:40.666 --> 01:08:43.583
I know, I know. I'm done. Done.
I swear it's over.

1024
01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:46.333
I just have to tie up
a few loose ends, and then I promise...

1025
01:08:46.750 --> 01:08:47.791
It's over.

1026
01:09:02.833 --> 01:09:04.375
Don't worry, I have a plan.

1027
01:09:05.083 --> 01:09:07.875
You stay calm and do what they say.
I know what I'm doing.

1028
01:09:10.166 --> 01:09:11.166
Dave, this is Ji.

1029
01:09:11.291 --> 01:09:13.291
We grew up together. Practically sisters.

1030
01:09:13.791 --> 01:09:16.041
She was the super fun one,
as you could tell.

1031
01:09:16.208 --> 01:09:17.458
Hi, Anna.

1032
01:09:17.625 --> 01:09:20.458
We're kind of in the middle
of a private conversation here,

1033
01:09:20.625 --> 01:09:22.083
if you guys don't mind, so...

1034
01:09:22.708 --> 01:09:24.708
- Time to go.
- Um...

1035
01:09:24.875 --> 01:09:26.958
I'm not finished with my coffee.

1036
01:09:27.125 --> 01:09:29.886
So if you and your boyfriend
and your little friends want to head off,

1037
01:09:30.041 --> 01:09:32.875
we'll... catch up with you later.

1038
01:09:37.166 --> 01:09:38.583
Hey! Get your hands off...

1039
01:09:41.208 --> 01:09:42.625
Ouch!

1040
01:09:51.041 --> 01:09:52.166
Ow!

1041
01:11:06.333 --> 01:11:09.916
<i>How could anyone not love
your furry little friend?</i>

1042
01:11:16.708 --> 01:11:18.916
Let me see, you're so cute.

1043
01:11:19.875 --> 01:11:22.000
- Mom.
- Mom!

1044
01:11:22.166 --> 01:11:24.500
- Hi! You guys OK?
- Yeah.

1045
01:11:24.833 --> 01:11:25.833
How did you...

1046
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.583
They've had a long trip.

1047
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.541
Now we're reunited.

1048
01:11:29.708 --> 01:11:31.125
That's all that matters.

1049
01:11:31.291 --> 01:11:34.333
You never told us we had an extra grandma.

1050
01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:35.916
No, I didn't. Where's Dave?

1051
01:11:36.083 --> 01:11:39.875
Oh, yeah. Daddy is resting.
He's not feeling his best.

1052
01:11:41.708 --> 01:11:42.708
Should we talk elsewhere?

1053
01:11:42.791 --> 01:11:44.000
No, I'm good right here.

1054
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000
OK.

1055
01:11:46.541 --> 01:11:49.250
Just don't hold on too tight.

1056
01:11:49.833 --> 01:11:51.208
Don't want to suffocate them.

1057
01:11:51.375 --> 01:11:53.291
What does suffocate mean?

1058
01:11:53.458 --> 01:11:55.041
I'll tell you later, baby.

1059
01:11:55.208 --> 01:11:57.833
Kids? Mommy and I need to talk, so...

1060
01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.750
Would you guys like to see
this really cool

1061
01:12:00.916 --> 01:12:03.541
and very fun little playhouse

1062
01:12:03.708 --> 01:12:05.666
that we have set up for you?

1063
01:12:06.291 --> 01:12:08.731
- Can we bring the puppy?
- Of course you can!

1064
01:12:08.958 --> 01:12:10.291
He's yours, right?

1065
01:12:10.666 --> 01:12:12.208
If your mother allows it.

1066
01:12:15.041 --> 01:12:17.250
Of course you can bring the puppy. Yay!

1067
01:12:17.416 --> 01:12:21.416
And let's set up that video game system,
OK Carlo?

1068
01:12:21.833 --> 01:12:23.041
Go on.

1069
01:12:25.041 --> 01:12:26.875
Yay!

1070
01:12:32.125 --> 01:12:33.125
Tea?

1071
01:12:41.916 --> 01:12:45.083
The unicorn wanted to see the queen

1072
01:12:45.250 --> 01:12:47.250
because she was that rainbow.

1073
01:12:47.416 --> 01:12:51.833
She wanted to make the unicorn
even prettier

1074
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.166
because she wanted her to be a statue
for her castle.

1075
01:12:55.333 --> 01:12:58.083
So I think that's because the queen is...

1076
01:12:58.250 --> 01:13:00.166
<i>You didn't have to bring them into this.</i>

1077
01:13:03.375 --> 01:13:04.750
You brought them into this.

1078
01:13:06.375 --> 01:13:08.791
Really, Anna.
Your plan was a little crude.

1079
01:13:08.958 --> 01:13:10.684
Of course, you knew
Dave was going to lead us

1080
01:13:10.708 --> 01:13:12.208
right to you. Huh?

1081
01:13:12.375 --> 01:13:14.500
For you to extract
whatever blunt sort of revenge

1082
01:13:14.666 --> 01:13:15.958
you had in mind.

1083
01:13:16.458 --> 01:13:18.833
And, of course,
we were going to take the kids.

1084
01:13:20.375 --> 01:13:23.375
Did you really think
it was going to be as simple as all that?

1085
01:13:24.625 --> 01:13:26.583
The kids are fine

1086
01:13:27.583 --> 01:13:30.500
if the video games and the dog
don't keep them occupied,

1087
01:13:30.666 --> 01:13:32.333
well, there's ping pong.

1088
01:13:33.166 --> 01:13:36.833
Not that you're teaching them the benefit
of physical exercise.

1089
01:13:37.916 --> 01:13:39.596
The way you're raising them, Anna.

1090
01:13:39.625 --> 01:13:40.625
Emma.

1091
01:13:42.708 --> 01:13:44.375
Emma.

1092
01:13:45.166 --> 01:13:46.458
You barely even changed it.

1093
01:13:46.625 --> 01:13:47.916
My name is Emma.

1094
01:13:49.791 --> 01:13:51.083
OK.

1095
01:13:52.041 --> 01:13:54.416
I see you, hm?

1096
01:13:55.375 --> 01:13:56.791
I hear you.

1097
01:13:57.416 --> 01:13:59.166
Is that what you need?

1098
01:13:59.833 --> 01:14:01.333
You've acted out

1099
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:02.958
all for what?

1100
01:14:03.375 --> 01:14:05.791
So you could pick out dishwasher pods
at Target

1101
01:14:05.958 --> 01:14:08.541
with Dave from New Jersey?

1102
01:14:08.708 --> 01:14:10.250
Yeah, I like New Jersey

1103
01:14:10.416 --> 01:14:12.333
and I love my family.

1104
01:14:13.041 --> 01:14:14.541
I just want a normal life.

1105
01:14:14.708 --> 01:14:16.375
You just want a normal life

1106
01:14:16.875 --> 01:14:19.458
while you're dropping bodies
from Athens to Zimbabwe.

1107
01:14:19.625 --> 01:14:22.000
- I'm not doing that anymore.
- Is that what you told him?

1108
01:14:22.166 --> 01:14:24.166
Yeah. I'm fucking done with all of it.
All of you!

1109
01:14:25.375 --> 01:14:27.458
Please, Anna. The language...

1110
01:14:27.625 --> 01:14:28.875
Fuck you.

1111
01:14:29.583 --> 01:14:32.583
You took me.
You're not going to take my kids.

1112
01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:35.375
Oh, please. They were given to me.

1113
01:14:35.958 --> 01:14:38.416
Your sister in law was very concerned

1114
01:14:38.583 --> 01:14:40.903
though I think is reassured
that the authorities had it all

1115
01:14:41.041 --> 01:14:42.041
well in hand.

1116
01:14:42.125 --> 01:14:44.166
The ITIC and all that.

1117
01:14:44.666 --> 01:14:46.625
And I never took you, Anna.

1118
01:14:46.791 --> 01:14:48.333
I took you in!

1119
01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:50.750
- I was a child.
- Stop.

1120
01:14:50.916 --> 01:14:53.375
Stop with the self-pity.

1121
01:14:53.875 --> 01:14:55.458
You're better than that.

1122
01:14:56.208 --> 01:14:57.750
At least you were.

1123
01:15:06.625 --> 01:15:09.291
Don't. I don't wanna see... don't.

1124
01:15:13.625 --> 01:15:15.000
Look at that girl.

1125
01:15:15.875 --> 01:15:16.916
Look at her strength.

1126
01:15:17.666 --> 01:15:18.666
Her power.

1127
01:15:18.750 --> 01:15:20.958
I gave those things to you.

1128
01:15:21.708 --> 01:15:23.583
That makes you mine,

1129
01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:25.958
always.

1130
01:15:28.708 --> 01:15:30.166
What do you want from me?

1131
01:15:30.333 --> 01:15:32.625
You know what I want.

1132
01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:35.125
I want you back.

1133
01:15:35.291 --> 01:15:37.250
We can all be a family.

1134
01:15:37.416 --> 01:15:38.833
Don't you see?

1135
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.166
And it's the only way for

1136
01:15:42.250 --> 01:15:44.291
your children to have a future,

1137
01:15:44.875 --> 01:15:45.916
to have a life

1138
01:15:46.083 --> 01:15:47.958
with you in it.

1139
01:15:53.083 --> 01:15:55.791
You only need to get rid of Dave.

1140
01:15:59.416 --> 01:16:00.708
Just one bullet.

1141
01:16:00.875 --> 01:16:03.708
Even off your game,
I can't imagine you'd need more than that.

1142
01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:06.750
Thank you.

1143
01:16:23.625 --> 01:16:26.791
Why don't you just do it?
If that's what you want. You do it.

1144
01:16:28.125 --> 01:16:29.750
I didn't bring him into this.

1145
01:16:31.791 --> 01:16:32.791
Hm...

1146
01:16:33.250 --> 01:16:36.458
This will put us on a better footing
to move forward together

1147
01:16:37.166 --> 01:16:38.500
as a family.

1148
01:16:39.166 --> 01:16:40.500
Your real family.

1149
01:16:41.833 --> 01:16:44.708
What if I pick it up,
put it in your face and pull the trigger?

1150
01:16:45.625 --> 01:16:49.375
Why don't do you think about
your children?

1151
01:16:49.833 --> 01:16:51.541
For once.

1152
01:16:52.333 --> 01:16:54.250
God knows I think about you.

1153
01:16:56.208 --> 01:16:57.500
My sweet girl.

1154
01:17:05.291 --> 01:17:06.458
Now.

1155
01:17:07.791 --> 01:17:09.583
Take him for a walk.

1156
01:17:10.875 --> 01:17:12.708
A walk in the woods.

1157
01:17:15.958 --> 01:17:17.458
Don't make me do this.

1158
01:17:17.625 --> 01:17:19.541
Shall I entertain the kids
while you're gone?

1159
01:17:20.083 --> 01:17:21.125
No.

1160
01:17:21.291 --> 01:17:23.666
- We could play a game.
- No.

1161
01:17:23.833 --> 01:17:26.041
- I could read them a story.
- No.

1162
01:17:26.208 --> 01:17:28.708
Those perfect little darlings.

1163
01:17:28.875 --> 01:17:31.083
I have so much I can teach them.

1164
01:17:32.541 --> 01:17:34.041
There is always a price.

1165
01:17:35.125 --> 01:17:37.708
- There's always a sacrifice.
- Don't make me do this.

1166
01:17:37.875 --> 01:17:40.458
I can forgive the worry you've caused.

1167
01:17:40.625 --> 01:17:43.500
- Stop.
- But you have to meet me halfway.

1168
01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.458
And this is how you do it.

1169
01:17:50.583 --> 01:17:52.166
Now take him for a walk.

1170
01:17:54.458 --> 01:17:56.250
A walk in the woods.

1171
01:18:06.875 --> 01:18:08.666
I don't want them anywhere near it.

1172
01:18:09.708 --> 01:18:11.208
My sweet girl.

1173
01:18:24.041 --> 01:18:25.333
Where are we?

1174
01:18:28.666 --> 01:18:30.125
Let's go for a walk.

1175
01:18:34.125 --> 01:18:35.416
OK.

1176
01:18:37.458 --> 01:18:38.916
What is this place?

1177
01:18:41.125 --> 01:18:43.205
- Dave, there's a sniper on us.
- What?

1178
01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:45.291
It's fine. She's always watching.

1179
01:18:45.458 --> 01:18:47.138
Listen Dave, I need to tell you something.

1180
01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:49.250
Tell me something, anything.

1181
01:18:50.333 --> 01:18:51.666
She has the kids.

1182
01:18:51.833 --> 01:18:54.666
They're OK. Stop.
They're fine. Calm down.

1183
01:18:55.250 --> 01:18:57.083
- Where are they?
- They're fine.

1184
01:18:57.250 --> 01:18:58.750
They are not hurt. They are happy.

1185
01:18:58.916 --> 01:19:00.833
They have no idea what's going on.

1186
01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.125
What are we gonna do?

1187
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:04.416
Emma, what the hell is wrong with you?

1188
01:19:04.583 --> 01:19:06.583
They have our kids.
What are we gonna do?

1189
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:15.083
Can you hold me?

1190
01:19:15.916 --> 01:19:16.916
Huh?

1191
01:19:17.041 --> 01:19:19.125
You know,
can you hold me like you used to?

1192
01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:22.625
Before all this shit.
Can you just hold me, please?

1193
01:19:23.375 --> 01:19:24.583
- Please!
- I mean...

1194
01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:26.291
- Now.
- OK.

1195
01:19:27.833 --> 01:19:29.250
Oh, OK.

1196
01:19:30.916 --> 01:19:32.291
OK.

1197
01:19:32.458 --> 01:19:33.625
OK. OK.

1198
01:19:35.458 --> 01:19:36.458
Emma,

1199
01:19:37.791 --> 01:19:39.375
what the hell is going on?

1200
01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:41.125
She wants me to kill you.

1201
01:19:41.291 --> 01:19:42.291
What?

1202
01:19:45.958 --> 01:19:48.083
- I'm sorry.
- Emma, I love you...

1203
01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:49.708
Ah!

1204
01:20:32.208 --> 01:20:33.291
Confirming the kill.

1205
01:21:00.916 --> 01:21:02.583
Wanna give me a hand or what?

1206
01:21:06.666 --> 01:21:07.791
Bitch.

1207
01:22:07.875 --> 01:22:10.208
Emma, what the hell is going on?

1208
01:22:13.458 --> 01:22:16.333
- She wants me to kill you.
- What?

1209
01:22:16.833 --> 01:22:18.958
I'm not going to.

1210
01:22:19.125 --> 01:22:20.750
It's a clean shot.

1211
01:22:20.916 --> 01:22:22.458
No vitals.

1212
01:22:22.625 --> 01:22:23.833
I know what I'm doing.

1213
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.333
Trust me.

1214
01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:27.458
And play dead.

1215
01:22:27.625 --> 01:22:29.458
- Huh?
- I'm sorry.

1216
01:22:29.625 --> 01:22:30.905
Emma, I love you...

1217
01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.280
Hello there.

1218
01:22:51.625 --> 01:22:53.250
Hey, hey, babe.

1219
01:22:53.416 --> 01:22:54.583
Babe, hey.

1220
01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:56.375
It's me. You can move. Hey.

1221
01:22:56.875 --> 01:22:59.291
- Oh my God, are you OK?
- You really shot me!

1222
01:22:59.458 --> 01:23:01.916
I know, I'm so sorry. Does it hurt?

1223
01:23:02.583 --> 01:23:05.041
Oh, God. Let me see. OK, listen.

1224
01:23:05.208 --> 01:23:06.833
You just have to apply pressure.

1225
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.583
- It is a slow bleed.
- OK.

1226
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:11.184
We get you to the hospital
in four or five hours. You'll be fine.

1227
01:23:11.208 --> 01:23:12.541
- What?
- Yeah.

1228
01:23:13.125 --> 01:23:15.500
OK come here.

1229
01:23:15.666 --> 01:23:16.958
I'm gonna get this off you.

1230
01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:20.791
OK.

1231
01:23:20.958 --> 01:23:22.416
- Can you get up?
- No.

1232
01:23:22.583 --> 01:23:24.958
Yes, you can. Come on,
I'll help you. Let me help you.

1233
01:23:25.125 --> 01:23:26.625
- Just give me a sec.
- Sorry.

1234
01:23:26.791 --> 01:23:27.791
- OK.
- Come on.

1235
01:23:29.708 --> 01:23:31.166
- Oh, sorry.
- OK.

1236
01:23:31.333 --> 01:23:32.333
- You OK?
- Mm-hm.

1237
01:23:32.416 --> 01:23:33.416
OK babe, listen to me.

1238
01:23:33.541 --> 01:23:35.166
I'm so sorry.

1239
01:23:35.333 --> 01:23:36.750
I have to go to work now though.

1240
01:23:36.916 --> 01:23:38.041
- OK.
- OK?

1241
01:23:38.208 --> 01:23:39.808
You're coming with me.

1242
01:23:39.833 --> 01:23:40.833
- Are you ready?
- OK.

1243
01:23:40.958 --> 01:23:41.998
- No.
- Yes.

1244
01:23:42.083 --> 01:23:43.642
I love you. Just stay close. We got this.

1245
01:23:43.666 --> 01:23:44.500
OK.

1246
01:23:44.666 --> 01:23:46.500
- I love you.
- I love you.

1247
01:23:46.666 --> 01:23:47.833
- OK. Come on.
- You shot me!

1248
01:23:49.458 --> 01:23:50.500
Come on.

1249
01:24:05.708 --> 01:24:08.333
OK. Yeah. Let's go, come on.

1250
01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:26.000
Shit. Come here. Quiet. Quiet.

1251
01:24:26.166 --> 01:24:27.750
- Ouch!
- Sorry.

1252
01:24:29.291 --> 01:24:30.416
OK.

1253
01:24:30.583 --> 01:24:32.250
Stay low and don't look.

1254
01:24:32.416 --> 01:24:33.583
OK. What?

1255
01:24:38.916 --> 01:24:40.083
Hi there.

1256
01:24:54.458 --> 01:24:55.458
You're OK?

1257
01:24:55.875 --> 01:24:56.708
What happened?

1258
01:24:56.875 --> 01:24:59.517
Listen, I know this is a lot,
but I need you now. I need you to focus.

1259
01:24:59.541 --> 01:25:01.375
- I need you.
- OK. OK, I'm here.

1260
01:25:01.541 --> 01:25:02.541
OK. Listen to me.

1261
01:25:02.583 --> 01:25:04.291
The kids are back there
in the guest house.

1262
01:25:04.458 --> 01:25:05.458
I need to go right there.

1263
01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:07.642
- You go to the kids and buy some time.
- Buy some time?

1264
01:25:07.666 --> 01:25:09.851
You're going to take this with you.
It's point and shoot.

1265
01:25:09.875 --> 01:25:10.916
Got it. Point and shoot.

1266
01:25:11.083 --> 01:25:12.892
- With any luck you're not gonna need it.
- OK.

1267
01:25:12.916 --> 01:25:14.434
- Cuz I need you to what?
- Buy some time.

1268
01:25:14.458 --> 01:25:16.351
I need to you buy some time.
I'll be right there.

1269
01:25:16.375 --> 01:25:17.375
Emma?

1270
01:25:18.666 --> 01:25:20.541
- I will be there.
- OK.

1271
01:25:22.541 --> 01:25:24.125
Point and shoot.

1272
01:25:25.916 --> 01:25:27.756
What do you mean, there's no response?

1273
01:25:33.041 --> 01:25:35.375
I just hope
she's not being emotional about this.

1274
01:25:45.250 --> 01:25:47.250
OK, just try not to kill her.

1275
01:25:47.875 --> 01:25:48.916
I want her alive.

1276
01:27:43.541 --> 01:27:45.458
Daddy!

1277
01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:47.000
Hi babe.

1278
01:27:47.166 --> 01:27:48.166
Ouch!

1279
01:27:49.833 --> 01:27:51.833
God... Ow...

1280
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.541
We're kind of having quite an adventure,
aren't we?

1281
01:28:06.833 --> 01:28:08.153
- Daddy?
- Yeah?

1282
01:28:08.208 --> 01:28:10.791
Are you sure you don't need a Band-Aid?

1283
01:28:13.666 --> 01:28:14.875
I'm fine.

1284
01:28:16.375 --> 01:28:17.708
Oh, that's good.

1285
01:28:46.708 --> 01:28:49.250
It's just the two of us now, Gwen.

1286
01:29:24.625 --> 01:29:26.875
Thought you were a better shot.

1287
01:29:34.875 --> 01:29:36.791
We don't have to do this, you know.

1288
01:29:37.666 --> 01:29:39.000
It's not too late.

1289
01:29:40.375 --> 01:29:41.750
We can still make this work.

1290
01:29:44.708 --> 01:29:46.208
I do love you, Anna.

1291
01:29:51.250 --> 01:29:53.041
You know I can see you, right?

1292
01:29:55.625 --> 01:29:59.041
I'm still the same woman
who put you in your jammies, remember?

1293
01:29:59.875 --> 01:30:01.208
Tucked you in at night.

1294
01:30:05.041 --> 01:30:07.958
Oh Gwen, I remember everything.

1295
01:30:08.583 --> 01:30:09.833
See how well you taught me?

1296
01:30:26.208 --> 01:30:27.958
Is this about Dave?

1297
01:30:31.333 --> 01:30:34.333
I know you're older now,
so stop acting like a child.

1298
01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:36.250
Make me.

1299
01:30:44.291 --> 01:30:46.500
That's enough, Anna.

1300
01:30:47.291 --> 01:30:49.541
That might be it
for your clip, Gwen.

1301
01:30:51.333 --> 01:30:52.333
Fuck.

1302
01:30:52.458 --> 01:30:53.541
Fuck.

1303
01:31:23.166 --> 01:31:24.375
My sweet girl.

1304
01:31:26.166 --> 01:31:27.566
That's what I like to see.

1305
01:31:33.250 --> 01:31:34.666
Finish me.

1306
01:31:41.041 --> 01:31:42.250
Finish me.

1307
01:31:50.166 --> 01:31:52.416
I would love to sit here
and watch you die.

1308
01:31:52.583 --> 01:31:55.666
But Mr. Fluff
and the Monkey Princess are feuding

1309
01:31:55.833 --> 01:31:58.541
and my family's waiting for me.

1310
01:32:18.958 --> 01:32:21.666
I am your boss,
but I'm a nice boss.

1311
01:32:25.458 --> 01:32:27.333
Hey, alligators!
Hi! Time to go, OK?

1312
01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:29.100
- Do we have to?
- Yes.

1313
01:32:29.208 --> 01:32:30.768
But Mom, we're in the middle of a race.

1314
01:32:30.833 --> 01:32:33.375
You heard your mom. Time to go.
Get your things, come on.

1315
01:32:33.541 --> 01:32:35.291
Babe are you OK? Any problems?

1316
01:32:35.458 --> 01:32:37.666
- Nothing I couldn't handle.
- OK.

1317
01:32:38.083 --> 01:32:39.083
You?

1318
01:32:39.125 --> 01:32:40.416
It's done.

1319
01:32:40.583 --> 01:32:42.375
Like done, done?

1320
01:32:42.541 --> 01:32:44.916
Done, done.

1321
01:32:45.083 --> 01:32:46.333
- Mommy?
- Yes, baby?

1322
01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:48.458
Did you cut yourself on a tree

1323
01:32:48.625 --> 01:32:50.000
like Daddy?

1324
01:32:50.166 --> 01:32:53.333
Yes, I did. It was an accident.
I'll going to tell you about in the car.

1325
01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:55.517
Let's go. Grab your jackets.
Wyatt, put the game down.

1326
01:32:55.541 --> 01:32:56.541
Come on!

1327
01:32:56.666 --> 01:32:58.583
- Can we bring Tuffy?
- Yes, grab Tuffy.

1328
01:32:58.750 --> 01:33:00.430
Really? We can keep him?

1329
01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:03.750
Well, pick him up before I change my mind.
Shhh. Grab your jackets.

1330
01:33:03.916 --> 01:33:06.000
Let's go. Let's go. Jackets. Jackets.

1331
01:33:06.166 --> 01:33:07.326
Can we get ice cream?

1332
01:33:07.416 --> 01:33:09.041
Come on. Come on.

1333
01:33:09.833 --> 01:33:11.291
What's wrong with Carlo?

1334
01:33:12.916 --> 01:33:15.000
Carlo's sleeping,
we don't want to wake him up.

1335
01:33:15.166 --> 01:33:16.458
So bye Carlo.

1336
01:33:16.625 --> 01:33:18.583
- Bye, Carlo.
- Bye, Carlo.

1337
01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:32.833
Where is my car seat?

1338
01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:34.458
We're gonna get you one babe.

1339
01:33:34.625 --> 01:33:36.333
I need my car seat.

1340
01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:38.750
Honey, don't worry.
This is just for a little bit, OK?

1341
01:33:38.916 --> 01:33:40.958
How did you guys get those marks?

1342
01:33:41.125 --> 01:33:42.765
I don't think you guys got cut by a tree.

1343
01:33:42.875 --> 01:33:45.166
- We got into a fight, buddy.
- With each other?

1344
01:33:45.333 --> 01:33:46.708
- No.
- No, no.

1345
01:33:46.875 --> 01:33:49.291
Some other guys. Some bad guys.

1346
01:33:49.458 --> 01:33:52.083
It's illegal for me
to not be in a car seat.

1347
01:33:52.250 --> 01:33:54.810
I know honey. Listen, we have to get Daddy
to a doctor right now,

1348
01:33:54.875 --> 01:33:56.515
and then I'm going to get you a car seat.

1349
01:33:56.583 --> 01:33:59.000
You told us we were going for ice cream.

1350
01:33:59.166 --> 01:34:01.046
Yes, I did.
But we got to get Daddy to a doctor.

1351
01:34:01.125 --> 01:34:03.333
Then I'm going to get you a car seat
and then ice cream.

1352
01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:04.916
But I'm hungry now.

1353
01:34:05.083 --> 01:34:06.750
- Oh my God!
- I know, I know.

1354
01:34:06.916 --> 01:34:08.458
We could get you a snack on the way.

1355
01:34:08.625 --> 01:34:09.945
What do they even eat in Germany?

1356
01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.875
Lots of good stuff.
Bratwurst. <i>Wiener schnitzel.</i>

1357
01:34:14.041 --> 01:34:16.684
- I don't want that.
- I don't want that, either.

1358
01:34:16.708 --> 01:34:19.291
- I want a hamburger.
- OK, hey, hey, hey.

1359
01:34:19.458 --> 01:34:22.666
You heard your mom. We're gonna...

1360
01:34:24.583 --> 01:34:26.958
We're gonna find some place good.

1361
01:34:49.875 --> 01:34:53.458
- Where are we going?
- Yeah, where are we going?

1362
01:34:53.625 --> 01:34:56.333
Don't worry. I have a plan.
