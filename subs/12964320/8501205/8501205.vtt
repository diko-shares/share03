[Raj on radio] <i>Having trouble
with the picture. CC's a little buggy.</i>

Hi! Oh!

31
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.291
Making my favorite pineapple chicken?

32
00:03:41.458 --> 00:03:42.666
That I am.

33
00:03:42.833 --> 00:03:44.458
Aww... Hi.

34
00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:46.000
- How was Nebraska?
- [groans]

35
00:03:46.166 --> 00:03:48.041
It was... Thank you... Meh.

36
00:03:48.208 --> 00:03:51.958
Four days of teaching mid level management
how to add vegan options

37
00:03:52.125 --> 00:03:54.000
to their franchise plans, which...

38
00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:57.541
I can guarantee is never gonna
happen in Plattsmouth, Nebraska.

00:04:06.916 --> 00:04:07.916
Yeah! The usual.

[chuckles]

44
00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:10.875
Hey, where is Wy?
Trash bins are still out.

45
00:04:11.041 --> 00:04:12.875
[Wyatt] Because they're too heavy.

46
00:04:13.041 --> 00:04:16.333
That cannot be, because this little one
ate all the bowling balls.

47
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.208
Hello, my love. I missed you.

48
00:04:18.416 --> 00:04:21.250
OK. Those babies are going low and slow.

49
00:04:22.375 --> 00:04:23.375
[whispers] Let's go.

50
00:04:23.458 --> 00:04:25.083
Honey, you uh...

51
00:04:27.083 --> 00:04:28.083
want to freshen up?

52
00:04:28.166 --> 00:04:29.500
- Hm?
- [Wyatt] Hey Mom, look.

53
00:04:29.708 --> 00:04:31.333
We're doing fancy restaurant.

54
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.708
Fancy restaurant?

55
00:04:32.916 --> 00:04:35.516
- I'm going to be the bartender.
- And I'm going to be the waiter.

56
00:04:37.375 --> 00:04:40.416
And you made the pineapple chicken?

57
00:04:42.458 --> 00:04:44.458
[melodically] Happy anniversary.

00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:48.458

<i>You must be riddled with guilt.
How do you deal with it?</i>

62
00:05:12.083 --> 00:05:14.500

64
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.333
Not even close.

- [Raj] <i>Got some good news</i>

68
00:05:26.208 --> 00:05:27.541
<i>and some bad news.</i>

69
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.041
<i>Bad news is your picture popped up again
on the dark net Most Wanted list.</i>

70
00:05:31.208 --> 00:05:33.833
<i>Good news is, I think
I scrubbed it out in time.</i>

71
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.583
<i>But you've got to stay low.</i>

72
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.375
Mm-hm. Yep, I got it.

73
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:39.166
Hey, can we talk about this later?

74
00:05:39.333 --> 00:05:41.500
[Raj] <i>Oh, Dave's there is he?
I won't keep you.</i>

75
00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:43.416
<i>- But there's another job.</i>
- Mm-hm.

76
00:05:43.583 --> 00:05:45.583
No, no, no. Not a chance.
Come on, I just got back.

77
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.750
[Raj]
<i>Shame. It's a lot of money, this one.</i>

78
00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.750
<i>And they want the best,</i>

79
00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:51.666
<i>which just so happens to be you.</i>

80
00:05:51.833 --> 00:05:54.041
Yeah. Raj, I am aware of that.

81
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.250
We talked about this,
no more trips till November.

82
00:05:56.416 --> 00:05:57.833
[Raj] <i>Take a break. Fine.</i>

83
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.281
<i>But Sovereign still has
a very healthy reward on your head</i>

84
00:06:00.416 --> 00:06:02.583
<i>for anyone who finds you.</i>

85
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.708
<i>Now if you don't work,
I don't have the funds to keep you safe.</i>

86
00:06:06.875 --> 00:06:08.166
<i>And it isn't cheap.</i>

87
00:06:08.333 --> 00:06:11.053
Can I call you tomorrow? These pancakes
are getting burned over here.

88
00:06:11.166 --> 00:06:14.041
[Raj] <i>Not surprised. Don't say
I didn't warn you about the heat.</i>

89
00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:16.666
Funny. Talk to you tomorrow.

90
00:06:16.833 --> 00:06:18.875
[Raj] <i>Just be careful. I'm trying to...</i>

91
00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:21.375
- You OK?
- Yeah. Work.

92
00:06:21.583 --> 00:06:24.434
If it were up to them, they'd have me run
the entire Midwest at this point.

93
00:06:24.458 --> 00:06:26.000
You're too good at your job.

94
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.041
So they tell me.

95
00:06:28.208 --> 00:06:30.088
- Who wants pancakes?
- [Wyatt and Caroline] Me!

96
00:06:30.166 --> 00:06:31.166
[Dave] All right.

97
00:06:31.208 --> 00:06:32.583
[Emma] There you go.

98
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.500
And... there you go, honey.

99
00:06:36.666 --> 00:06:38.083
There you go, baby.

100
00:06:39.333 --> 00:06:42.416
Hey, I didn't want the bunny one.
I want the boring one.

101
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.666
There you go. Problem...

102
00:06:45.333 --> 00:06:46.333
Solved!

103
00:06:46.458 --> 00:06:47.916
- Good job.
- You're welcome.

104
00:06:48.125 --> 00:06:49.916
- I'll take that.
- Hey!

105
00:06:50.333 --> 00:06:51.708
- [Dave] Bye!
- [Emma] Bye!

106
00:06:51.916 --> 00:06:54.375
- I'll make you another one.
- [Caroline] So as I said...

107
00:06:54.541 --> 00:06:56.166
Mr. Fluff and the Monkey Princess

108
00:06:56.375 --> 00:06:57.875
can't go together

109
00:06:58.041 --> 00:06:59.666
because they're not getting along.

110
00:06:59.833 --> 00:07:02.833
OK. Why is Mr. Fluff
and the Monkey Princess feuding?

111
00:07:03.041 --> 00:07:04.541
Because he's jealous.

112
00:07:04.708 --> 00:07:06.708
Jealous of who?
Johnny the Jackalope?

113
00:07:06.916 --> 00:07:09.083
Jealous of the Phantom Queen.

114
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.333
[emphasizes] The Phantom Queen. OK.

115
00:07:11.541 --> 00:07:14.083
All right honey, hold that thought, OK?

116
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.625
[Kev] I don't know man.
It's just something's off, you know?

117
00:07:24.916 --> 00:07:27.458
Trina just...
She feels like she's a million miles away.

118
00:07:28.333 --> 00:07:31.416
I mean, now she's at her sister's wedding
and not a single text.

119
00:07:31.916 --> 00:07:33.958
She's at her sister's wedding
and you're not there?

120
00:07:34.166 --> 00:07:35.166
Yeah. Why, is that bad?

121
00:07:35.375 --> 00:07:37.875
Well, it's not great, Kev.

122
00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:41.250
See,
this is why I need your perspective here.

123
00:07:41.458 --> 00:07:42.666
Because you know.

124
00:07:43.041 --> 00:07:46.083
I mean, you and Emma have been
married, what now? 20 years?

125
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:47.250
Seven.

126
00:07:48.083 --> 00:07:50.750
You guys are like, well...

127
00:07:50.916 --> 00:07:52.083
couple goals.

128
00:07:53.916 --> 00:07:54.916
Yeah.

129
00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.166
No, no, no. It's still not OK.

130
00:07:58.375 --> 00:08:01.333
I knew you were coming off a long week.
I was coming off a long week.

131
00:08:01.541 --> 00:08:03.291
I figured we'd do something this weekend.

132
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.375
Well, you made my favorite meal.
The kids did fancy restaurant.

133
00:08:06.583 --> 00:08:09.000
- I blew it.
- You had a long week.

134
00:08:09.208 --> 00:08:11.375
I forgot our anniversary.

135
00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:12.916
I'm the worst.

136
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:32.250
What's that?

137
00:08:32.291 --> 00:08:33.791
- What?
- That.

138
00:08:35.416 --> 00:08:38.333
- Uh... This?
- Yes!

139
00:08:39.041 --> 00:08:41.291
This may be a... maybe a mistake.

140
00:08:41.458 --> 00:08:43.125
Dave! Did...

141
00:08:44.333 --> 00:08:46.583
Did you get me trashy lingerie?

142
00:08:48.041 --> 00:08:49.125
I mean, see what you think.

143
00:08:50.583 --> 00:08:53.375
You did and it's a costume!

144
00:08:54.666 --> 00:08:57.833
- Ha! Sexy nurse.
- Well, sexy nurse practitioner.

145
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.958
- Oh right, no, of course.
- Bit much?

146
00:09:01.125 --> 00:09:03.000
No, no, not at all.

147
00:09:03.166 --> 00:09:05.125
I mean I just thought, you know,
it might be...

148
00:09:05.583 --> 00:09:08.083
fun to mix things up a bit.

149
00:09:12.666 --> 00:09:14.875
Is that what you want?
To mix things up a bit?

150
00:09:15.333 --> 00:09:16.813
Or do you want me to be someone else?

151
00:09:19.375 --> 00:09:20.416
For one night.

152
00:09:21.041 --> 00:09:22.458
[dreamy piano music]

153
00:09:22.625 --> 00:09:23.958
Uh...

154
00:09:24.125 --> 00:09:25.375
I mean...

155
00:09:26.416 --> 00:09:27.708
Why not?

156
00:09:29.083 --> 00:09:30.625
I could change things up too.

157
00:09:30.833 --> 00:09:33.875
- This would be a two way street, so yeah.
- Sure, I could go Doctor.

158
00:09:34.041 --> 00:09:35.625
Stay on theme.

159
00:09:35.791 --> 00:09:38.083
- I need a stethoscope...
- Yes, but I...

160
00:09:39.083 --> 00:09:40.458
Let's do this for real.

161
00:09:41.791 --> 00:09:43.125
Tomorrow night in the city.

162
00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:45.708
Tomorrow night.
Short notice for a babysitter.

163
00:09:45.916 --> 00:09:47.716
Well, your sister still owes us
for Christmas.

164
00:09:47.916 --> 00:09:50.476
She does still owe us for Christmas.
OK so what are you thinking?

165
00:09:50.666 --> 00:09:51.958
See a show?

166
00:09:52.833 --> 00:09:55.208
No, we're not going to see a show, Dave.

167
00:09:56.666 --> 00:09:57.750
We're going to a hotel.

168
00:09:59.416 --> 00:10:01.375
- We're going to a hotel?
- A fancy hotel.

169
00:10:02.791 --> 00:10:05.833
We are going to meet by chance
in the hotel bar.

170
00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.458
I won't be me.

171
00:10:08.625 --> 00:10:09.666
You won't be you.

172
00:10:09.875 --> 00:10:13.000
Just two strangers meeting in a bar.

173
00:10:13.208 --> 00:10:16.250
Just two strangers meeting in a bar.

174
00:10:17.791 --> 00:10:20.458
[Caroline from afar]
<i>Mommy! I need a glass of water!</i>

175
00:10:20.625 --> 00:10:22.041
Tomorrow night.

176
00:10:23.458 --> 00:10:25.666
- Tomorrow night.
- [Emma] Tomorrow night.

177
00:10:27.125 --> 00:10:28.458
I'm gonna hold on to this.

178
00:10:29.083 --> 00:10:32.500
[Caroline yelling] Come back here,
I'm gonna get what you stole!

179
00:10:32.666 --> 00:10:33.791
[Wyatt] No, you're not.

180
00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:37.291
- [Emma] Guys, slow it down!
- [Caroline yells]

181
00:10:37.458 --> 00:10:39.083
Oh my God!

182
00:10:39.583 --> 00:10:42.708
I think it's great. I really do.
You guys deserve this.

183
00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:45.000
Yeah. Yeah it's just, you know...

184
00:10:45.208 --> 00:10:47.041
- We do, right?
- [Molly] Hell yes.

185
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:51.333
You've both been working a lot.
The kids are awesome.

186
00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:54.666
[Caroline yelling angrily]

187
00:10:54.833 --> 00:10:56.458
[Molly] You guys never leave the house

188
00:10:56.666 --> 00:10:59.106
and a backyard barbecue ain't gonna cut it
for an anniversary.

189
00:10:59.291 --> 00:11:00.875
[both laugh]

190
00:11:01.041 --> 00:11:02.250
[Molly] OK.

191
00:11:02.416 --> 00:11:03.776
- Show me the shoes.
- [Emma] Yeah.

192
00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.000
[Molly laughs]

193
00:11:05.166 --> 00:11:06.916
[Emma] Wait till you see the wig.

194
00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:09.791
[upbeat swing music]

195
00:11:30.875 --> 00:11:32.250
[doorman] Evening, miss.

196
00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.166
[laughing]

197
00:11:41.166 --> 00:11:43.875
[indistinct chatter]

198
00:12:04.583 --> 00:12:05.583
Excuse me.

199
00:12:05.708 --> 00:12:07.267
- Vodka martini, please.
- [waitress] Yes.

200
00:12:07.291 --> 00:12:08.291
Thanks.

201
00:12:10.625 --> 00:12:13.666
[cars honking]

202
00:12:16.708 --> 00:12:18.166
Come on!

203
00:12:18.333 --> 00:12:20.208
[indistinct radio chatter]

204
00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:32.375
Really?

205
00:12:36.125 --> 00:12:37.125
[car horn]

206
00:12:37.166 --> 00:12:39.083
- [indistinct chatter]
- [club music playing]

207
00:12:42.333 --> 00:12:43.333
[waitress] Miss.

208
00:12:43.416 --> 00:12:45.416
Compliments of the gentleman.

209
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.916
The kind of night I'm having
you wouldn't believe.

210
00:13:07.333 --> 00:13:08.333
Really?

211
00:13:08.916 --> 00:13:11.125
This is the kind of night
if I didn't find an empty seat

212
00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:13.171
next to a beautiful woman
at a well-stocked bar,

213
00:13:13.333 --> 00:13:17.041
I might start to question my luck in life.
But then, here I am. [laughs]

214
00:13:18.041 --> 00:13:19.791
So how bad a night can it be?

215
00:13:20.416 --> 00:13:22.125
Bob Kitterman.

216
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.541
- Alice Overby.
- Wonderful.

217
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.583
Well...

218
00:13:31.583 --> 00:13:35.541
Alice Overby,
are you here alone? May I ask?

219
00:13:35.708 --> 00:13:37.041
It would appear to be, Bob.

220
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.083
[laughs] Well, well. Traveling?

221
00:13:40.291 --> 00:13:42.041
- It is a hotel, Bob.
- Fair enough.

222
00:13:42.208 --> 00:13:44.601
People end up in hotels for all
kinds of reasons, don't they?

223
00:13:44.625 --> 00:13:45.708
That is true.

224
00:13:45.875 --> 00:13:47.916
Forgive me.
I have to ask, are you a model?

225
00:13:48.125 --> 00:13:49.125
Ha!

226
00:13:49.291 --> 00:13:52.833
Your expression says I overshot.
But I assure you, it's not a line.

227
00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:56.125
You're very beautiful.
And you do look familiar.

228
00:13:56.291 --> 00:13:58.375
Well, thank you,
but I'm actually in finance.

229
00:13:58.583 --> 00:13:59.583
Ah!

230
00:13:59.625 --> 00:14:01.791
That's why I've felt
such a profound connection to you.

231
00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.416
Seeing you from over there, like I...
like I've known you for a long, long time.

232
00:14:05.625 --> 00:14:07.125
Are you in finance too, Bob?

233
00:14:07.291 --> 00:14:09.559
Don't worry, I'm not going
to tear your ear off about work.

234
00:14:09.583 --> 00:14:12.791
I have a strict policy
of keeping my daytimes out of my nights

235
00:14:13.416 --> 00:14:15.000
and vice versa. [laughs]

236
00:14:16.375 --> 00:14:17.958
But let me ask you

237
00:14:18.458 --> 00:14:19.583
one question.

238
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.500
OK Bob, one question.

239
00:14:23.041 --> 00:14:26.416
Do you love what you do?

240
00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:33.958
Some days.

241
00:14:34.125 --> 00:14:35.125
[Bob laughs]

242
00:14:36.083 --> 00:14:38.708
Some days, she says.
She kills me, this one.

243
00:14:39.875 --> 00:14:43.666
Alice Overby loves what she does
some days. I'll drink to that.

244
00:14:46.541 --> 00:14:48.541
[intriguing music]

245
00:14:49.208 --> 00:14:51.375
[Bob] All right well there it is,
mystery solved.

246
00:14:52.083 --> 00:14:53.666
But you really do look familiar.

247
00:14:53.875 --> 00:14:57.416
And I don't mean that
as some kind of line...

248
00:14:57.583 --> 00:14:59.291
some kind of ploy.

249
00:15:00.583 --> 00:15:02.375
I just have that kind of face, I guess.

250
00:15:03.208 --> 00:15:06.250
Some people do have that kind of face,
like an old girlfriend...

251
00:15:10.791 --> 00:15:14.000
[unintelligible]

252
00:15:14.708 --> 00:15:17.068
- [waitress] What can I get you?
- I'll do an old fashioned.

253
00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:18.166
- Sure.
- Thanks.

254
00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:19.916
[Bob] There are some young women

255
00:15:20.083 --> 00:15:22.291
that fall easily under the spell
of a much older man,

256
00:15:22.458 --> 00:15:24.958
but I suspect you
may not be one of them.

257
00:15:25.125 --> 00:15:27.325
Not the way you're making eyes
at this one down the bar.

258
00:15:28.208 --> 00:15:31.291
Look, as a little junior broker
on his night out,

259
00:15:31.708 --> 00:15:33.541
if I can be frank,
I think you can do better.

260
00:15:34.208 --> 00:15:35.666
Maybe I'm not in the market, Bob.

261
00:15:35.833 --> 00:15:37.166
Ah, I see.

262
00:15:37.333 --> 00:15:39.666
Just unwinding at the end
of a long day of business travel,

263
00:15:39.833 --> 00:15:41.392
wanting to be alone with your thoughts.

264
00:15:41.416 --> 00:15:43.208
- Trying.
- [Bob] Well, Alice.

265
00:15:43.375 --> 00:15:44.895
I'm going to give you that opportunity

266
00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.625
because I must remove myself for a moment.

267
00:15:48.083 --> 00:15:50.500
But, uh... Don't you go anywhere.

268
00:15:50.666 --> 00:15:52.625
Oh, no promises, Bob.

269
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:29.291
Have we met?

270
00:16:30.416 --> 00:16:31.416
I don't think so.

271
00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:32.750
Oh.

272
00:16:33.333 --> 00:16:34.333
Well, I'm Jack.

273
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.833
Jack. Alice Overby.

274
00:16:37.375 --> 00:16:39.208
Jack Dawson.

275
00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:43.458
Jack Dawson.
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

276
00:16:44.291 --> 00:16:45.791
Jack Dawson. [giggles]

277
00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.500
Leo. <i>Titanic.</i> Really?

278
00:16:52.208 --> 00:16:54.250
How about, uh...
How about I buy you a drink?

279
00:16:55.208 --> 00:16:56.500
Yes, please.

280
00:16:56.666 --> 00:16:59.166
That is, unless your friend would mind.

281
00:16:59.333 --> 00:17:01.041
Oh, he's not my friend. We just met.

282
00:17:04.916 --> 00:17:06.416
What are you drinking, Alice?

283
00:17:06.583 --> 00:17:08.666
- Vodka martini.
- [Dave] All right.

284
00:17:09.208 --> 00:17:12.916
Excuse me. I'd like a vodka
martini for the lady

285
00:17:13.083 --> 00:17:15.791
and I'll bill that to the room,
if that's all right.

286
00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.041
Sure. I just need the name
and the room number.

287
00:17:18.208 --> 00:17:19.708
It's Jack...

288
00:17:20.291 --> 00:17:22.333
Dawson. And the room number is...

289
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.958
Put that on mine, Chaz,
if that's all right with you, Jack.

290
00:17:25.125 --> 00:17:26.525
- Oh, no, it's fine.
- [Bob] Please.

291
00:17:26.625 --> 00:17:29.505
Just had some very nice news about work
and I'm in the mood to celebrate.

292
00:17:29.541 --> 00:17:32.125
Another scotch and soda for me.
Jack, another old fashioned?

293
00:17:32.291 --> 00:17:34.125
Uh, sure... Thanks.

294
00:17:34.291 --> 00:17:35.458
Jack, Bob. Bob, Jack.

295
00:17:35.625 --> 00:17:38.208
- Pleasure, Jack. Great suit.
- Oh, thank you.

296
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:40.583
- Staying at the hotel?
- That's right.

297
00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:42.916
Um... In town for business.

298
00:17:43.083 --> 00:17:45.844
Well, the lady and I have made
a very firm agreement not to talk shop,

299
00:17:45.916 --> 00:17:48.875
so I'll ask what it is you do.
We'll leave it at that.

300
00:17:49.166 --> 00:17:52.625
Yes, please do tell us.
Please tell us. Jack, What do you do?

301
00:17:54.666 --> 00:17:56.166
I'm a photographer.

302
00:17:56.333 --> 00:17:58.583
[emphasizes] Wow! Art or commerce?

303
00:17:58.750 --> 00:17:59.958
Journalism, mainly.

304
00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:03.625
I used to photograph combat zones,

305
00:18:03.791 --> 00:18:05.750
but now it's mainly wildlife.

306
00:18:05.916 --> 00:18:08.166
Exotic locales, that kind of thing.

307
00:18:08.333 --> 00:18:10.125
Wow! Wonderful, don't you think?

308
00:18:10.291 --> 00:18:11.375
Yeah, wonderful.

309
00:18:11.541 --> 00:18:13.416
I'm in finance myself, like the lady here.

310
00:18:13.583 --> 00:18:18.208
So for two sharks like us:
Wow, Jack, photography! [laughs]

311
00:18:18.375 --> 00:18:19.625
Now,

312
00:18:19.791 --> 00:18:23.416
maybe those drinks won't quite suffice.
How about...

313
00:18:24.083 --> 00:18:24.916
a shot?

314
00:18:25.083 --> 00:18:26.583
[intriguing music]

315
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.500
- Oh, I don't think...
- I don't remember the last time I did one.

316
00:18:29.666 --> 00:18:32.291
Chaz, this rowdy crowd here
is fixing to add some shots.

317
00:18:32.458 --> 00:18:35.083
Some of that nice mezcal
you showed me last night.

318
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:37.833
In the business we're in,
good news is so rare.

319
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.541
I appreciate the company
for a celebratory round.

320
00:18:40.708 --> 00:18:43.416
Congrats Bob,
on whatever good news you've got.

321
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.750
Well I don't mean to be coy, of course,

322
00:18:46.916 --> 00:18:51.083
but as it happens, a rather large contract
has all but fallen in my lap.

323
00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:54.041
So naturally, I'm over the moon.

324
00:18:54.208 --> 00:18:57.750
Sure, you'd be interested in the detail.

325
00:18:57.916 --> 00:19:00.516
I didn't get the particulars
of which part of the financial sector

326
00:19:00.541 --> 00:19:01.541
you're in, did I Alice?

327
00:19:01.708 --> 00:19:03.375
Mergers and acquisitions.

328
00:19:03.541 --> 00:19:07.375
Ah! So yes, I'm sure
we do have a lot in common after all.

329
00:19:07.541 --> 00:19:10.181
- [Bob] You're not based in New York?
- No, just here for meetings.

330
00:19:10.333 --> 00:19:12.653
I thought we might have
some European colleagues in common.

331
00:19:12.708 --> 00:19:13.708
[Emma] Domestic only.

332
00:19:13.791 --> 00:19:15.671
- Aren't we done talking business, Bob?
- Right.

333
00:19:15.833 --> 00:19:19.208
Make a rule just to break it.
Naughty Bob! Ah, wonderful.

334
00:19:20.916 --> 00:19:22.166
<i>Salute.</i>

335
00:19:22.333 --> 00:19:23.453
- [Emma] Hm...
- [Dave] Hm...

336
00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.000
Yeah.

337
00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:28.333
[coughs]

338
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.833
[Bob] Wow!

339
00:19:30.708 --> 00:19:32.875
I should have warned you.
Bit of a kick.

340
00:19:33.041 --> 00:19:34.791
Oh, yeah.
That's why I don't take shots.

341
00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:37.125
[laughs loudly]

342
00:19:37.291 --> 00:19:39.375
Excuse me, can I get a water please?
Thank you.

343
00:19:39.541 --> 00:19:41.958
This one is bright as a button, Jack.
You better believe it.

344
00:19:42.125 --> 00:19:43.166
Oh, I believe it.

345
00:19:43.333 --> 00:19:45.500
[Bob] The kind of woman
a lot of men are looking for.

346
00:19:45.666 --> 00:19:47.166
A lot of men might kill for.

347
00:19:47.333 --> 00:19:50.000
Aren't we lucky to keep her company
even for a fleeting moment?

348
00:19:50.166 --> 00:19:51.875
In fact, I'll raise a glass to it.

349
00:19:53.166 --> 00:19:55.958
To... It is Alice, isn't it?

350
00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.958
As long as I can remember, Bob.

351
00:19:58.125 --> 00:19:59.541
To Alice Overby.

352
00:19:59.708 --> 00:20:03.875
And to all the less lucky victims
of her considerable charms.

353
00:20:11.166 --> 00:20:12.416
[huffs] Another.

354
00:20:12.583 --> 00:20:13.958
We're good.

355
00:20:14.375 --> 00:20:15.375
[Dave] Bob...

356
00:20:15.541 --> 00:20:17.541
- It's been a pleasure.
- Ah! [laughs]

357
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.250
I see. It would appear
I am cramping the young man's style.

358
00:20:21.416 --> 00:20:23.096
- Heaven forbid.
- I don't mean to be rude.

359
00:20:23.208 --> 00:20:24.208
No, of course not.

360
00:20:24.375 --> 00:20:26.375
If I were 20 years younger,
I might take offence...

361
00:20:26.458 --> 00:20:27.458
Bob!

362
00:20:27.541 --> 00:20:30.291
The hint is taken. So I will leave you.

363
00:20:30.458 --> 00:20:32.958
And Jack... [trills lips]
best of luck.

364
00:20:33.125 --> 00:20:34.250
And Alice, dear,

365
00:20:34.416 --> 00:20:36.750
dear, Alice. [smacks lips]

366
00:20:36.916 --> 00:20:39.583
511 is the sweet number.
If anyone's itching for a nightcap,

367
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:41.708
once they blink the lights.

368
00:20:42.125 --> 00:20:43.500
And on that note...

369
00:20:44.166 --> 00:20:45.166
Pow.

370
00:20:47.833 --> 00:20:48.833
[Emma giggles]

371
00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:51.375
I cannot believe we're finally alone.

372
00:20:51.541 --> 00:20:53.958
It is hard to believe, isn't it? [giggles]

373
00:20:54.791 --> 00:20:57.708
So should we continue
getting to know each other, Jack?

374
00:20:58.583 --> 00:21:01.750
I would like that, Alice.
I would like that a lot.

375
00:21:02.125 --> 00:21:03.250
More shots?

376
00:21:03.416 --> 00:21:04.541
[elevator door rings]

377
00:21:07.166 --> 00:21:10.833
[Dave] I'm actually here
scouting a location for a...

378
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
new solo show I have in the spring.

379
00:21:15.166 --> 00:21:17.041
- Solo? Cool.
- Yeah, sure.

380
00:21:17.208 --> 00:21:20.083
All the photographs I've taken in Beirut.

381
00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.500
And Turks and Caicos.

382
00:21:22.666 --> 00:21:24.875
- Turks and Caicos?
- Both of them.

383
00:21:25.041 --> 00:21:27.958
Is that your room, Mr. Dawson?

384
00:21:28.125 --> 00:21:29.708
- Yeah, yeah.
- OK.

385
00:21:29.875 --> 00:21:31.750
- [Dave]Here we are.
- [Emma] OK.

386
00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:33.833
- Here.
- Let's go, come on in.

387
00:21:36.791 --> 00:21:38.708
[Emma] Join me in the room.

388
00:21:40.583 --> 00:21:43.416
Should I put on some music?

389
00:21:43.583 --> 00:21:45.333
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah? OK.

390
00:21:48.083 --> 00:21:49.375
[romantic jazz music plays]

391
00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:50.583
[sighs]

392
00:21:51.458 --> 00:21:52.625
[Dave] Oh, that's good.

393
00:21:55.125 --> 00:21:56.750
Here you go.

394
00:21:56.916 --> 00:21:59.041
Thank you. Cheers.

395
00:21:59.208 --> 00:22:00.791
- Cheers.
- Drink up.

396
00:22:02.666 --> 00:22:04.000
[Emma giggles]

397
00:22:04.166 --> 00:22:08.291
OK.
So why don't you also remove your shoes

398
00:22:08.458 --> 00:22:11.416
and meet me on the bed?
Get comfortable.

399
00:22:11.583 --> 00:22:13.083
I'll be right back.

400
00:22:13.416 --> 00:22:14.625
[Dave] I'll do that.

401
00:22:16.625 --> 00:22:17.875
I'll do that.

402
00:22:26.458 --> 00:22:29.166
[curious music]

403
00:24:20.291 --> 00:24:21.625
May I?

404
00:24:26.333 --> 00:24:27.750
Smart girl.

405
00:24:31.208 --> 00:24:34.083
How long have you been Alice Overby?

406
00:24:34.708 --> 00:24:36.333
Or was that just for tonight?

407
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.041
Yeah. It's hard to keep track, Bob.

408
00:24:38.208 --> 00:24:39.541
You know the drill.

409
00:24:41.083 --> 00:24:42.763
- So who are you?
- [Bob] A kindred spirit.

410
00:24:42.875 --> 00:24:45.000
That simp down there, he a target?

411
00:24:45.666 --> 00:24:46.986
Being that we're kindred spirits,

412
00:24:47.125 --> 00:24:49.666
you can understand why I don't want
to elaborate on that topic.

413
00:24:49.833 --> 00:24:50.833
[Bob] Fair enough.

414
00:24:50.875 --> 00:24:52.416
Me, I'm an open book.

415
00:24:52.583 --> 00:24:55.623
You see that Panamanian diplomat they
pulled out the East River this morning?

416
00:24:55.708 --> 00:24:56.958
I must have missed that one.

417
00:24:57.125 --> 00:24:58.934
[Bob] More a headache
than it should have been.

418
00:24:58.958 --> 00:25:00.750
Ruined my favorite shirt.
You can believe it.

419
00:25:00.916 --> 00:25:03.375
So imagine my delight,

420
00:25:03.541 --> 00:25:05.500
when I see the woman across the bar

421
00:25:05.666 --> 00:25:07.416
is a familiar face.

422
00:25:07.583 --> 00:25:08.583
[waitress] <i>Miss.</i>

423
00:25:08.708 --> 00:25:10.583
<i>Compliments of the gentleman.</i>

424
00:25:11.708 --> 00:25:15.250
[Bob] <i>And the familiar face
has a very large bounty attached to it.</i>

425
00:25:15.416 --> 00:25:17.333
She kills me this one.

426
00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.125
[Bob] <i>But I had to be sure.</i>

427
00:25:19.291 --> 00:25:21.750
Why, I stepped away
to take a more careful look

428
00:25:21.916 --> 00:25:24.125
at your photograph on the tip sheet.

429
00:25:24.291 --> 00:25:27.250
Sure enough, there it is.
The one and only

430
00:25:27.416 --> 00:25:28.791
Anna Peller.

431
00:25:28.958 --> 00:25:30.750
[inhales deeply]

432
00:25:30.916 --> 00:25:32.291
Oh, relax.

433
00:25:33.125 --> 00:25:34.750
Relax!

434
00:25:34.916 --> 00:25:36.625
Sovereign doesn't want you dead,

435
00:25:36.791 --> 00:25:40.291
which, come to think of it,
does set the mind reeling.

436
00:25:40.875 --> 00:25:44.166
A hired killer breaks with the world's
leading murder for hire syndicate

437
00:25:44.333 --> 00:25:45.458
and goes off grid.

438
00:25:45.625 --> 00:25:47.833
But I'm not even supposed to kill her.
[snorts]

439
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.958
Gwen Carver
must have a real soft spot for you.

440
00:25:51.125 --> 00:25:52.708
Can we cut to the chase here, Bob?

441
00:25:52.875 --> 00:25:55.458
Well, perhaps us two birds of a feather

442
00:25:55.625 --> 00:25:57.166
could come up with an arrangement.

443
00:25:57.333 --> 00:25:58.875
Hm. And what does that look like?

444
00:25:59.041 --> 00:26:01.333
Sixty percent commission
on any future work.

445
00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:04.083
And you and me,
we keep a line open just between us.

446
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.083
Hm...

447
00:26:06.666 --> 00:26:09.916
I could call our mutual friends
at Sovereign right now.

448
00:26:10.083 --> 00:26:12.541
Send one text
and bring the whole world down

449
00:26:12.708 --> 00:26:13.875
on your head.

450
00:26:14.708 --> 00:26:17.666
And do quite right by my bank account.

451
00:26:20.166 --> 00:26:21.875
So you don't work for Sovereign?

452
00:26:22.333 --> 00:26:24.583
I work for the highest bidder.
I always have.

453
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.500
Twenty.

454
00:26:32.416 --> 00:26:33.500
Fifty.

455
00:26:33.666 --> 00:26:34.666
Twenty-five.

456
00:26:34.708 --> 00:26:38.125
[Bob] Do not underestimate me
or what I'm capable of.

457
00:26:38.291 --> 00:26:41.750
Sovereign wants you alive, this is true.
But alive is a pretty broad term.

458
00:26:52.125 --> 00:26:53.958
- Nothing for you, Bob?
- [Bob laughs]

459
00:26:54.125 --> 00:26:57.750
A cyanide on the rocks?
I think I'll pass.

460
00:26:58.166 --> 00:26:59.666
OK. Suit yourself.

461
00:27:02.583 --> 00:27:03.583
There you go.

462
00:27:03.625 --> 00:27:04.791
So what do you think?

463
00:27:04.958 --> 00:27:07.458
You think we're getting closer to a deal?

464
00:27:07.625 --> 00:27:09.000
Forty.

465
00:27:09.916 --> 00:27:12.958
See, I don't think I have 40 percent
to give you.

466
00:27:13.125 --> 00:27:14.666
I already give 30 percent
to the guy

467
00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:17.375
who's supposed to keep guys
like you away from me. So...

468
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:20.083
it's not in the budget.
You feel free to make that call.

469
00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:21.250
[laughs]

470
00:27:21.958 --> 00:27:23.238
Although I don't think you will.

471
00:27:23.375 --> 00:27:25.875
And why,
is it out of the goodness of my heart?

472
00:27:26.041 --> 00:27:27.333
Oh, no, no, no.

473
00:27:27.833 --> 00:27:29.642
Because I already poisoned you
back at the bar.

474
00:27:29.666 --> 00:27:31.250
[laughs]

475
00:27:31.416 --> 00:27:33.666
- [laugh dissipates] wha...
- [chilling music]

476
00:27:33.833 --> 00:27:36.033
You should know I don't leave home
without three things:

477
00:27:37.375 --> 00:27:38.708
My phone,

478
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:42.541
my compact,

479
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.208
and something a little more...

480
00:27:47.125 --> 00:27:48.125
lethal.

481
00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:50.642
[Bob] Should have warned you.
Bit of a kick, that one. Are you OK?

482
00:27:50.666 --> 00:27:53.000
Oh, yeah. That's why I don't take shots.

483
00:27:53.166 --> 00:27:54.916
Excuse me, can I have a water, please?

484
00:27:55.083 --> 00:27:56.916
To Alice Overby.

485
00:27:57.083 --> 00:27:59.166
And to all the less lucky victims

486
00:27:59.333 --> 00:28:01.500
of her considerable charms.

487
00:28:08.791 --> 00:28:10.434
[Emma] You should really start
to feel that,

488
00:28:10.458 --> 00:28:12.416
right about...

489
00:28:13.041 --> 00:28:14.041
- [phone beeps]
- Now.

490
00:28:14.166 --> 00:28:15.708
[phone beeping]

491
00:28:16.708 --> 00:28:18.416
[Emma] Oh, Bob.

492
00:28:18.583 --> 00:28:21.208
My friend. Shots are never a good idea.

493
00:28:21.375 --> 00:28:23.041
No. You took your eyes off your scotch.

494
00:28:24.083 --> 00:28:27.208
I just came up here to make sure
you hadn't called our friends at Sovereign

495
00:28:27.375 --> 00:28:29.416
before you lost your speech.

496
00:28:29.583 --> 00:28:31.166
And your sight.

497
00:28:32.583 --> 00:28:34.041
And the rest.

498
00:28:39.291 --> 00:28:42.041
[sighs] Bob, Bob, Bob.

499
00:28:42.208 --> 00:28:43.875
Sorry man. Wrong place, wrong time.

500
00:28:44.041 --> 00:28:46.708
I have a family to protect.
I'm sure you understand.

501
00:28:46.875 --> 00:28:47.958
- [phone rings]
- Shit.

502
00:28:51.041 --> 00:28:52.208
Hey, babe. Hi.

503
00:28:52.375 --> 00:28:53.875
Hey, where are you?

504
00:28:54.041 --> 00:28:56.601
Did you get my note? I just ran out
to get aspirin. I'll be right back.

505
00:28:56.625 --> 00:28:57.851
[Dave] <i>I woke up and you were gone.</i>

506
00:28:57.875 --> 00:28:59.833
Oh no, I'm sorry.
Just going to be a quick thing.

507
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.375
- [Dave] <i>Can you grab me some too?</i>
- Yeah. No problem.

508
00:29:02.958 --> 00:29:03.791
[gunshot]

509
00:29:03.958 --> 00:29:05.208
[dramatic music]

510
00:29:05.375 --> 00:29:07.041
- OK. I'll see you soon.
- [gunshots]

511
00:29:08.125 --> 00:29:10.291
[gunshots]

512
00:29:15.875 --> 00:29:17.125
[screams]

513
00:29:17.666 --> 00:29:19.208
[glass breaks]

514
00:29:31.666 --> 00:29:32.708
[whispers] Great.

515
00:29:40.416 --> 00:29:42.375
[police sirens at distance]

516
00:29:43.375 --> 00:29:44.666
Hey.

517
00:29:45.791 --> 00:29:47.958
I can't believe I fell asleep.

518
00:29:48.125 --> 00:29:49.416
[Emma] Oh... [giggles]

519
00:29:49.583 --> 00:29:51.000
Oh, no, it's OK.

520
00:29:51.708 --> 00:29:52.750
I'm sorry.

521
00:29:52.916 --> 00:29:54.375
Don't be sorry.

522
00:29:55.541 --> 00:29:58.000
- [Dave] I'm awake now.
- [Emma giggles]

523
00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:00.958
How's your head?

524
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.166
It's better now.

525
00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:21.500
["Take Me Out" by Scissor Sisters]

526
00:30:33.958 --> 00:30:35.375
Our first dance.

527
00:30:37.541 --> 00:30:39.708
- Must be a sign.
- Yeah...

528
00:30:40.291 --> 00:30:41.458
Must be.

529
00:30:57.875 --> 00:31:01.000
[Molly] All right, lovebirds.
Enjoy those hangovers.

530
00:31:01.166 --> 00:31:03.500
- [Emma] Thank you. We love you.
- [Molly] Love you.

531
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.125
[Caroline] Molly said Coco missed us

532
00:31:08.291 --> 00:31:09.916
and wanted to see us.

533
00:31:10.083 --> 00:31:13.458
I think that's because
he doesn't have enough dog friends.

534
00:31:13.625 --> 00:31:15.333
So if we get a dog,

535
00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.916
Coco wouldn't be lonely anymore.

536
00:31:18.083 --> 00:31:21.291
And our dog could play with Coco
all the time.

537
00:31:21.458 --> 00:31:23.833
Mom is allergic baby.
We've talked about this.

538
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.041
Yeah, no dogs.

539
00:31:25.208 --> 00:31:27.000
But they do have dogs
with no fur, you know?

540
00:31:27.166 --> 00:31:28.642
- We could get one of those.
- [Dave] No dogs

541
00:31:28.666 --> 00:31:30.958
and no screens at the table, remember?

542
00:31:31.125 --> 00:31:33.458
[Wyatt] Well,
how does Mom get to be on the phone?

543
00:31:34.166 --> 00:31:35.458
Naughty mommy.

544
00:31:37.416 --> 00:31:38.416
Hey.

545
00:31:38.916 --> 00:31:41.250
- Are you OK?
- Oh yeah. Sorry.

546
00:31:41.416 --> 00:31:42.958
It's Raj. He's just freaking out.

547
00:31:43.125 --> 00:31:45.845
They're thinking of scrapping
the entire strategy for the East Coast.

548
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.500
- [phone vibrates]
- I don't know.

549
00:31:47.666 --> 00:31:49.625
And now he's calling me. Babe, I'm sorry.

550
00:31:49.791 --> 00:31:51.291
I'm sorry.

551
00:31:51.875 --> 00:31:53.000
[Emma] Hey.

552
00:31:54.708 --> 00:31:56.791
[inquisitive music]

553
00:31:56.958 --> 00:31:59.017
[Raj on phone] <i>You don't text me,
you don't call. I do.</i>

554
00:31:59.041 --> 00:32:00.125
<i>That's what we agreed.</i>

555
00:32:00.291 --> 00:32:02.541
Raj, I'm exposed.

556
00:32:03.541 --> 00:32:04.916
[Raj] <i>What happened?</i>

557
00:32:05.083 --> 00:32:06.583
Did you see what I sent you?

558
00:32:08.291 --> 00:32:09.916
[Raj] <i>Oh God, what a mess.</i>

559
00:32:10.083 --> 00:32:11.791
<i>I told you to stay low.</i>

560
00:32:11.958 --> 00:32:13.638
Someone found me.
I had to take care of it.

561
00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:15.791
[Raj] <i>This is all over the news.</i>

562
00:32:15.958 --> 00:32:18.875
<i>- You're 100 percent on Carver's radar now.</i>
- I'm coming to you.

563
00:32:19.125 --> 00:32:20.500
- Tomorrow.
- [Raj] <i>No, don't.</i>

564
00:32:20.666 --> 00:32:23.546
[Raj] <i>If Sovereign's got your scent,
the last place to be is the airport.</i>

[phone ringing]

566
00:32:27.791 --> 00:32:29.291
Hey, what's up?

567
00:32:29.458 --> 00:32:31.378
[Molly on the phone]
<i>Bro, the Royal Grand, right?</i>

568
00:32:31.958 --> 00:32:33.041
What?

569
00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.583
[Molly] <i>The hotel you were staying at.
It was the Royal Grand?</i>

570
00:32:37.291 --> 00:32:38.666
Yeah. Why?

571
00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:41.541
[Molly] <i>Texting you a link right now.</i>

572
00:32:43.625 --> 00:32:44.833

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:52.875
[Molly]
<i>Dude, you guys know how to pick a hotel.</i>

574
00:33:02.291 --> 00:33:03.875
[Dave yells] Emma!

575
00:33:04.041 --> 00:33:06.208
[Dave] Police sources say
that the murder took place

576
00:33:06.375 --> 00:33:09.166
somewhere between midnight
and 3 a.m. last night.

577
00:33:09.333 --> 00:33:10.791
Hotel staff discovered the body

578
00:33:10.958 --> 00:33:13.916
when Mr. Kitterman
failed to check out this morning.

579
00:33:14.083 --> 00:33:16.541
No suspects have yet been named
in the investigation.

580
00:33:16.708 --> 00:33:20.083
The police are seeking to identify
a man and woman

581
00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:24.000
seen talking with the victim
at the hotel bar

582
00:33:24.166 --> 00:33:25.833
earlier on the night in question.

583
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:26.833
That's us.

584
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.958
- [Dave stutters] T-t-that's us!
- Mm-hm.

585
00:33:29.125 --> 00:33:31.250
Police stressed it is early
in the investigation,

586
00:33:31.416 --> 00:33:33.875
but did confirm that the couple
from the bar

587
00:33:34.041 --> 00:33:37.166
are currently considered
persons of interest in the case.

588
00:33:37.333 --> 00:33:38.583
That is one hundred percent us.

589
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:41.333
We are the man and woman
from the hotel bar.

590
00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:42.916
We are the persons of interest.

591
00:33:43.083 --> 00:33:44.916
Sure there are no pictures on there?

592
00:33:46.375 --> 00:33:48.083
- No, none.
- OK.

593
00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:50.458
Um... We have to call. Right?

594
00:33:51.083 --> 00:33:53.476
[stutters] Is-is there even a number?
How would we call them?

595
00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.250
There is. There is. Should I call?

596
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:57.726
- What do we tell them?
- What do we tell them about what?

597
00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:59.333
Why we're not who we say we are?

598
00:34:00.958 --> 00:34:03.708
Right... The fake names!

599
00:34:03.875 --> 00:34:06.458
- I was wearing a fucking wig, Dave.
- [Dave] Oh, shit!

600
00:34:07.291 --> 00:34:08.458
OK, OK...

601
00:34:09.833 --> 00:34:12.250
We may not have been the only ones
he talked to at the bar.

602
00:34:12.416 --> 00:34:13.791
We did shots with him, Dave.

603
00:34:14.541 --> 00:34:15.625
We did shots...

604
00:34:16.125 --> 00:34:18.083
Damn it! Why did we do shots?

605
00:34:19.041 --> 00:34:21.125
OK, we wait.

606
00:34:22.416 --> 00:34:24.916
We wait.
OK. It's not like we know anything.

607
00:34:25.083 --> 00:34:27.625
Right? We'll see. We'll see...

608
00:34:28.333 --> 00:34:30.166
Maybe... maybe someone comes forward.

609
00:34:30.333 --> 00:34:33.541
Maybe they catch the person who did it.

610
00:34:33.708 --> 00:34:34.541
We wait and see.

611
00:34:34.708 --> 00:34:36.625
Yes, we wait and see. Good.

612
00:34:36.791 --> 00:34:38.375
They don't even know who we are.

613
00:34:38.541 --> 00:34:41.375
- Kitterman picked up the tab, so...
- [Dave] Right. Right.

614
00:34:41.541 --> 00:34:42.916
- We wait.
- Yeah.

615
00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:44.916
Looks kinda... yeah.

616
00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.291
- Is that crazy?
- Um...

617
00:34:47.458 --> 00:34:51.666
It just doesn't look good.
I mean, the names, the wig, the shots...

618
00:34:52.333 --> 00:34:53.583
No, it doesn't look good.

619
00:34:54.083 --> 00:34:55.083
Uh huh.

620
00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:57.916
- [Emma] Oh my God.
- Hey, hey, hey.

621
00:34:58.916 --> 00:35:00.236
- It's going to be OK.
- Yeah. No.

622
00:35:00.375 --> 00:35:03.351
Everything is happening all at once,
and it's all coming down at the same time.

623
00:35:03.375 --> 00:35:05.083
And I just. That call I just had with Raj

624
00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:06.770
and now they need me in Boise tomorrow

625
00:35:06.916 --> 00:35:08.166
instead of next month.

626
00:35:08.333 --> 00:35:10.453
So I figured out
this flight for the morning, and I...

627
00:35:11.208 --> 00:35:12.848
- But you just got back!
- I know, I know.

628
00:35:12.875 --> 00:35:14.041
It's just for one meeting.

629
00:35:14.458 --> 00:35:17.226
I'll be back Monday, and maybe
if they haven't figured this out by then,

630
00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:18.416
we'll call. We'll call then.

631
00:35:18.583 --> 00:35:20.750
OK, yeah. That's good. Yeah...

632
00:35:20.916 --> 00:35:23.250
Yeah, all right. We'll call then.

633
00:35:23.958 --> 00:35:26.291
Boise?
Can't you do a Zoom?

634
00:35:26.458 --> 00:35:27.458
No.

635
00:35:27.583 --> 00:35:29.543
It has to be in person, sorry.
It has to be quick.

636
00:35:29.625 --> 00:35:31.958
[Dave] OK. OK. We're gonna be OK.

637
00:35:32.125 --> 00:35:34.708
- [Emma] We're gonna be OK.
- [Dave sighs loudly]

638
00:35:34.875 --> 00:35:37.000
[calm melancholic music]

639
00:35:48.416 --> 00:35:50.375
[breathes loudly]

640
00:36:08.291 --> 00:36:10.083
- [Dave] Car's here.
- [Emma] OK.

641
00:36:16.458 --> 00:36:18.625
Hey. Go easy on your old man, OK?

642
00:36:18.791 --> 00:36:20.833
- Sure, Mom.
- I'm going to miss you.

643
00:36:25.375 --> 00:36:26.958
Baby girl. Hi.

644
00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:30.125
When are you coming home?

645
00:36:30.291 --> 00:36:32.208
You won't even notice I'm gone.

646
00:36:32.375 --> 00:36:34.583
I already notice that you're gone.

647
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:37.916
[whispers] OK.

648
00:36:38.583 --> 00:36:41.041
- I love you.
- [Caroline] I love you too.

649
00:36:41.208 --> 00:36:43.000
I know, God. OK, baby.

650
00:36:43.166 --> 00:36:44.916
I gotta go. I gotta go.

651
00:36:50.958 --> 00:36:55.333
OK, um... Hey, don't forget
Wyatt starts his second vitamins tomorrow

652
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.583
and Car's new pick up time is...

653
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:59.291
At four, not five.

654
00:37:00.208 --> 00:37:02.083
- I love you.
- Love you too.

655
00:37:03.958 --> 00:37:06.291
- [Emma] I'll call when I can.
- Fly safe.

656
00:37:08.291 --> 00:37:11.083
OK. I'm gonna come get you at the airport.

657
00:37:12.708 --> 00:37:14.041
Yeah.

658
00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:15.541
All right.

659
00:37:15.708 --> 00:37:16.791
OK.

660
00:37:19.541 --> 00:37:20.583
Love you.

661
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.041
Love you.

662
00:37:30.333 --> 00:37:31.791
[driver] Which terminal?

663
00:37:33.125 --> 00:37:34.291
International.

664
00:37:35.333 --> 00:37:37.416
[curious music]

665
00:37:41.791 --> 00:37:44.000

<i>But if we manage to land the equal
market demo space at South By,</i>

668
00:37:58.541 --> 00:38:00.458
<i>that could be a game changer...</i>

669
00:38:01.791 --> 00:38:04.500
Now. I'll throw it over to Dave. Dave!

670
00:38:06.583 --> 00:38:12.125
Yes, it's very exciting.
As Kevin was saying...

[Molly on phone] <i>She says she's missing
the pink water bottle from the backpack.</i>

675
00:38:47.833 --> 00:38:50.708
Molly, I'm sure she'll survive.

676
00:38:50.875 --> 00:38:53.708
I can't talk pink water bottles right now.
I'm at the airport.

677
00:38:53.875 --> 00:38:56.125
[Molly]
<i>I'm just telling you what she told me.</i>

678

I need you to check again.
It's Emma. Emma Brackett.

681

It's the flight from Boise.

B, R, A...

688
00:39:47.875 --> 00:39:49.250
Sir, I already searched.

689
00:39:49.416 --> 00:39:52.208
[airline employee]
and there's nothing else I can do.

690
00:39:52.375 --> 00:39:53.458
...T.

691
00:40:09.083 --> 00:40:11.208
[suspenseful music]

692
00:40:13.541 --> 00:40:14.833
[car tire screeches]

693
00:40:15.916 --> 00:40:17.875
[detective] Dave Brackett?

694
00:40:18.041 --> 00:40:21.208
Detective Tobi Berman,
NYPD Homicide.

695
00:40:21.375 --> 00:40:23.041
That's my partner.
Detective Karen Shah.

696
00:40:23.208 --> 00:40:25.083
You got a few minutes?

697
00:40:28.166 --> 00:40:32.125
I know, I know. We were going to call
when she got back.

698
00:40:32.291 --> 00:40:33.583
And your wife ain't back.

699
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:36.958
Yes. So you should be calling the police
in Boise, right?

700
00:40:37.125 --> 00:40:40.165
Yeah, you can bet we're gonna get on that,
Dave. Right after we're done here.

701
00:40:40.291 --> 00:40:41.809
Look, am I being accused of something?

702
00:40:41.833 --> 00:40:44.166
Do you feel like you're being accused
of something?

703
00:40:44.333 --> 00:40:47.125
Well, I feel like...
I feel like maybe I should...

704
00:40:47.291 --> 00:40:48.891
I feel like maybe
I should have a lawyer.

705
00:40:48.916 --> 00:40:51.000
Do you have a lawyer, Dave?

706
00:40:51.833 --> 00:40:54.500
I have a guy who drew up paperwork
for us for the house.

707
00:40:54.666 --> 00:40:56.306
[Berman] Why do you want to call the guy?

708
00:40:56.833 --> 00:40:58.500
Did the paperwork for the house

709
00:40:58.666 --> 00:41:00.375
like your real estate agent?

710
00:41:00.541 --> 00:41:02.059
[Shah] Or we can call someone for you.

711
00:41:02.083 --> 00:41:03.916
Look, I'm not trying to be difficult.

712
00:41:04.083 --> 00:41:05.666
I don't think you're being difficult.

713
00:41:05.833 --> 00:41:07.708
I think maybe you're nervous.

714
00:41:07.875 --> 00:41:09.375
No, I'm not. I'm not nervous.

715
00:41:09.541 --> 00:41:11.083
[Berman] It's normal to be nervous.

716
00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:13.083
We're just looking for information.

717
00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:14.500
Sure.

718
00:41:14.666 --> 00:41:16.500
Now do you want to wait for that lawyer?

719
00:41:16.666 --> 00:41:19.306
Or do you want to keep talking
about that night at the Royal Grand?

720
00:41:19.375 --> 00:41:22.583
OK. OK. Yeah.
So it was our anniversary Thursday.

721
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:24.916
How did you and your wife
know Mr. Kitterman?

722
00:41:25.416 --> 00:41:27.958
We didn't. We didn't!

723
00:41:28.125 --> 00:41:30.083
I was late to meet her

724
00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:31.541
at the bar.

725
00:41:31.708 --> 00:41:34.625
I guess he had started chatting her up.

726
00:41:34.791 --> 00:41:38.583
And when I...
Look, I think he'd had a few.

727
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:42.333
And were you using an assumed name
that night at the hotel, Mr. Brackett?

728
00:41:44.208 --> 00:41:45.625
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What?

729
00:41:45.791 --> 00:41:48.625
[Shah] You were using an assumed name
that night at the hotel.

730
00:41:50.375 --> 00:41:51.375
Um...

731
00:41:52.875 --> 00:41:54.333
[Dave] I...

732
00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:57.958
OK, look. This looks pretty bad. I know.

733
00:41:58.125 --> 00:42:00.291
Um...
Honestly, it's just a little embarrassing.

734
00:42:01.375 --> 00:42:03.500
See, my wife and I, we were...

735
00:42:03.666 --> 00:42:08.333
We were playing a game,
you know, like a kind of like a...

736
00:42:09.541 --> 00:42:11.125
Like a role play.

737
00:42:11.291 --> 00:42:14.708
Just like a game, you know, or whatnot.

738
00:42:14.875 --> 00:42:18.250
And in the interest of excitement
and whatnot, we...

739
00:42:18.875 --> 00:42:19.875
[sighs]

740
00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:21.333
we use different names.

741
00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:23.000
And um...

742
00:42:23.916 --> 00:42:28.208
It was just to spice things up
a little bit, you know? You know.

743
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.250
[Shah] Do you and your wife

744
00:42:34.416 --> 00:42:36.333
role play often, Mr. Brackett?

745
00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.708
[exclaims] No! No.

746
00:42:38.875 --> 00:42:40.666
It was the first time.

747
00:42:40.833 --> 00:42:42.625
[intriguing music]

748
00:42:45.041 --> 00:42:48.333
Mr. Brackett,
this is Special Agent Carver with ITIC.

749
00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.060
She'll be joining us,
if you don't mind.

750
00:42:50.208 --> 00:42:53.583
[Berman] She's part of a task force
helping in this investigation.

751
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:56.916
Nice to meet you, Mr. Brackett.
Please continue.

752
00:42:59.458 --> 00:43:02.375
Mr. Brackett, how long have you
and your wife been married?

753
00:43:02.958 --> 00:43:04.916
Seven years as of Thursday.

754
00:43:05.083 --> 00:43:07.458
- And you have two children?
- Yes.

755
00:43:07.625 --> 00:43:09.291
Wyatt is ten. Caroline, six.

756
00:43:09.458 --> 00:43:11.708
Wyatt's my son from a previous marriage.

757
00:43:11.875 --> 00:43:13.833
Emma has been his mom
for a long time now.

758
00:43:16.083 --> 00:43:17.666
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but...

759
00:43:17.833 --> 00:43:20.833
What is it? What exactly is this about?

760
00:43:32.666 --> 00:43:34.625
[Shah] Is this woman your wife,
Mr. Brackett?

761
00:43:35.625 --> 00:43:36.791
No.

762
00:43:36.958 --> 00:43:38.916
Her name is Emma Rayburn.

763
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:42.666
That's Emma's name. Maiden name.

764
00:43:42.833 --> 00:43:45.541
[Shah] No. This woman is Emma Jay Rayburn.

765
00:43:46.083 --> 00:43:48.958
Thirty-three years old.
Five foot seven, hazel eyes.

766
00:43:49.125 --> 00:43:52.916
Social security number: 174631503.

767
00:43:53.083 --> 00:43:54.291
What are you telling me?

768
00:43:56.333 --> 00:43:59.291
Mr. Brackett, Emma Rayburn died
eight years ago.

769
00:43:59.875 --> 00:44:02.875
You met your wife about eight years ago.
Is that right?

770
00:44:03.041 --> 00:44:05.000
[inquisitive music]

771
00:44:11.666 --> 00:44:12.916
- [Carver] Dave?
- Huh?

772
00:44:13.083 --> 00:44:16.375
I'm going to show you some photographs
of my own, if that's all right.

773
00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:20.791
This is from Buenos Aires Airport,

774
00:44:20.958 --> 00:44:23.500
Argentina, last Wednesday.

775
00:44:24.583 --> 00:44:29.000
Four hours before this picture was taken,
a local union leader was found murdered.

776
00:44:29.916 --> 00:44:32.916
A woman matching this description
was seen leaving the crime scene.

777
00:44:33.083 --> 00:44:35.083
Yeah, but she was in Nebraska.

778
00:44:35.833 --> 00:44:36.833
So...

779
00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:40.958
The man at the hotel, Robert Kitterman,

780
00:44:41.125 --> 00:44:44.125
we believe that's an alias used
by this man, Derrick Worley,

781
00:44:44.708 --> 00:44:48.791
a contract killer responsible
for more than 30 murders internationally.

782
00:44:50.708 --> 00:44:52.166
[chokes]

783
00:44:52.333 --> 00:44:53.791
[Carver] This is Rajendra Bakshi.

784
00:44:56.791 --> 00:44:58.958
That's my wife's supervisor. Raj.

785
00:44:59.541 --> 00:45:02.083
[Carver] He's a black marketeer
working the dark web.

786
00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:06.166
Born in Chennai, raised in the UK,
operating out of Berlin.

787
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.708
He serves as her handler.

788
00:45:12.125 --> 00:45:13.416
Her handler?

789
00:45:13.583 --> 00:45:15.583
[Carver] This is not gonna be easy,
Mr. Brackett,

790
00:45:17.166 --> 00:45:18.291
but...

791
00:45:19.208 --> 00:45:20.708
your wife's real name

792
00:45:20.875 --> 00:45:22.458
is Anna Peller.

793
00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:25.708
Wanted for contract killings across
several continents.

794
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:28.791
We need you to help us find her.

795
00:45:29.458 --> 00:45:31.208
[chuckles]

796
00:45:31.375 --> 00:45:33.083
I'm sorry.

797
00:45:34.666 --> 00:45:36.500
[snorts] I'm sorry.

798
00:45:36.666 --> 00:45:38.958
[Dave laughs]

799
00:45:43.083 --> 00:45:44.791
What the...

800
00:45:48.416 --> 00:45:49.833
What?

801
00:45:51.291 --> 00:45:53.750
[tense rock music]

802
00:46:35.583 --> 00:46:37.000
[bang]

803
00:46:37.333 --> 00:46:38.875
[grunts]

804
00:47:16.541 --> 00:47:17.666
What...

805
00:47:24.625 --> 00:47:26.625
[suspenseful music]

806
00:47:31.625 --> 00:47:33.000
[doorbell rings]

807
00:47:37.916 --> 00:47:39.000
Oh...

808
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:41.125
Agent Carver.

809
00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:43.916
Mr. Bracket. Glad we caught you at home.

810
00:47:44.083 --> 00:47:48.333
This is my associate at the agency.
Agent Ji.

811
00:47:48.583 --> 00:47:49.583
Hi. Hey...

812
00:47:50.458 --> 00:47:51.541
I'm Dave.

813
00:47:52.166 --> 00:47:54.458
Would it be possible
to have a moment of your time?

814
00:47:55.416 --> 00:47:57.958
Oh... What is it I can help you with?

815
00:48:00.958 --> 00:48:02.708
Well, um...

816
00:48:03.208 --> 00:48:05.416
This might be a bit awkward out here.

817
00:48:10.041 --> 00:48:11.500
[Carver] There she is.

818
00:48:13.791 --> 00:48:15.375
You have a lovely family.

819
00:48:15.916 --> 00:48:17.083
[Dave] Thank you.

820
00:48:17.583 --> 00:48:20.458
Wyatt, and um...

821
00:48:21.375 --> 00:48:22.583
Caroline.

822
00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:23.791
Mm-hm.

823
00:48:23.958 --> 00:48:25.708
Mind if we keep this?

824
00:48:26.041 --> 00:48:27.166
We'll get it back to you.

825
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.125
- [airport speaker monitors]
- [upbeat music]

826
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:35.958
<i>Danke.</i>

827
00:48:37.875 --> 00:48:39.458
[bystanders] Taxi! Taxi!

828
00:48:56.666 --> 00:48:57.916
You look terrible.

829
00:48:58.083 --> 00:48:59.916
Yeah, it was a very long flight.

830
00:49:00.083 --> 00:49:01.708
Three flights in fact.

831
00:49:01.875 --> 00:49:03.275
[Raj] You shouldn't have come here.

832
00:49:03.333 --> 00:49:04.916
- It's not safe.
- [Emma] Oh, OK.

833
00:49:05.083 --> 00:49:06.833
Then drive the damn car.

834
00:49:11.375 --> 00:49:13.055
[Dave] What can I do for you,
Agent Carver?

835
00:49:13.083 --> 00:49:16.000
It's really more
about what we can do for you.

836
00:49:18.291 --> 00:49:19.333
How's that?

837
00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:21.333
You must have concerns

838
00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:23.333
for the safety of your family.

839
00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:24.916
And I think

840
00:49:25.416 --> 00:49:27.583
your feelings about your wife

841
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:30.041
must be complicated right now,

842
00:49:30.708 --> 00:49:32.208
to say the least.

843
00:49:32.375 --> 00:49:34.791
But I want you to know
that I will do anything in my power

844
00:49:34.958 --> 00:49:36.041
to bring her back.

845
00:49:37.416 --> 00:49:38.416
Thanks.

846
00:49:38.458 --> 00:49:40.818
Look, I fucked up in New York.
I get that, we make mistakes.

847
00:49:40.958 --> 00:49:43.434
It happens to the best of us.
But why was there heat on me at first?

848
00:49:43.458 --> 00:49:45.418
Actually, no.
It doesn't happen to the best of us.

849
00:49:45.583 --> 00:49:48.500
I can't protect you if you're out there
murdering sovereign reps.

850
00:49:48.666 --> 00:49:50.706
He wasn't Sovereign.
He just had them on speed dial.

851
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:52.041
Why was there heat on me?

852
00:49:52.208 --> 00:49:55.666
There's always heat. Don't you get it?
She's never gonna to let you go.

853
00:49:56.541 --> 00:49:58.083
[Carver] Emma is a threat.

854
00:49:58.791 --> 00:50:00.041
A dangerous one.

855
00:50:00.625 --> 00:50:02.625
Maybe most dangerous to herself.

856
00:50:04.458 --> 00:50:05.500
Dave,

857
00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:09.041
I understand your loyalty to your wife,

858
00:50:09.916 --> 00:50:11.583
but it is crucial

859
00:50:12.083 --> 00:50:13.208
right now

860
00:50:13.375 --> 00:50:16.791
that I search your house for evidence
to help us locate her.

861
00:50:19.458 --> 00:50:22.583
Sorry to ask, but um... [clears throat]

862
00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:25.375
don't you need...

863
00:50:26.166 --> 00:50:28.541
don't you need a warrant for that?

864
00:50:33.041 --> 00:50:35.684
[Emma] Oh, you sure you don't want
to hand me in and take the reward?

865
00:50:35.708 --> 00:50:36.708
[Raj] Very funny.

866
00:50:36.875 --> 00:50:39.515
If I wanted to hand you over,
I could have done it a long time ago.

867
00:50:39.583 --> 00:50:41.000
Oh yeah?

868
00:50:41.166 --> 00:50:43.166
Do you have any idea what I do for you?

869
00:50:43.833 --> 00:50:45.375
What you do for me?

870
00:50:45.541 --> 00:50:47.000
Last I checked,

871
00:50:47.166 --> 00:50:49.125
I do the dirty work, and you get paid.

872
00:50:49.291 --> 00:50:51.166
I keep you underground.

873
00:50:51.333 --> 00:50:52.666
Yeah well...

874
00:50:52.833 --> 00:50:55.416
that's not exactly going as planned.

875
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:59.791
Your wife, Emma, is a role
played by a criminal

876
00:50:59.958 --> 00:51:01.750
named Anna Peller.

877
00:51:02.458 --> 00:51:04.041
She played you.

878
00:51:05.833 --> 00:51:07.375
Don't let her play you anymore.

879
00:51:07.541 --> 00:51:10.041
You've been on the tip sheet
since the sighting in Tel Aviv.

880
00:51:10.208 --> 00:51:11.291
You know that.

881
00:51:11.458 --> 00:51:14.500
The last thing you should be doing
is trolling luxury hotels in Manhattan.

882
00:51:16.416 --> 00:51:19.041
I forgot our fucking anniversary.

883
00:51:19.208 --> 00:51:23.333
She is incapable of love or compassion.

884
00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:27.708
She is a cold-blooded killer

885
00:51:28.958 --> 00:51:31.625
who lied to you
and endangered your children.

886
00:51:32.375 --> 00:51:33.791
[Raj] It's not just New York.

887
00:51:33.958 --> 00:51:35.851
Your head isn't in the game
and I know that before.

888
00:51:35.875 --> 00:51:38.333
Yeah, well, I told you I need out.
Do you have them?

889
00:51:43.875 --> 00:51:45.625
Kids too?

890
00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:48.916
Good. Good.

891
00:51:50.333 --> 00:51:51.375
[Carver] Dave,

892
00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:53.166
I'm going to ask you one more time.

893
00:51:54.083 --> 00:51:56.333
Might I take a look around?

894
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.041
I've done what I can
to protect your little fantasy

895
00:52:01.208 --> 00:52:02.708
but it's time to wake up, Emma.

896
00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:04.291
Um...

897
00:52:05.541 --> 00:52:07.875
Time to say goodbye
to your perfect little family.

898
00:52:08.041 --> 00:52:10.958
I told you, I'm getting them out
and then I'm done with all this shit.

899
00:52:11.125 --> 00:52:14.625
She is a cold-blooded murderer.

900
00:52:15.375 --> 00:52:16.575
[Raj] Until the money runs out

901
00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:18.583
or they pick up your scent.

902
00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:20.541
And I'm not there to help you.

903
00:52:30.083 --> 00:52:33.375
Black G-wagon about three cars back.
It's Sovereign.

904
00:52:37.041 --> 00:52:39.958
Pull up over here. Just pull over!

905
00:52:52.833 --> 00:52:54.958
[Carver] Um... Mr. Brackett,

906
00:52:55.125 --> 00:52:57.605
I'm very sorry. We're going
to have to continue this discussion

907
00:52:57.708 --> 00:52:59.083
at a later date.

908
00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:00.583
We will be in touch.

909
00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:02.791
And thank you very much for your time.

910
00:53:03.583 --> 00:53:05.083
Yeah, sure.

[Raj]
You can't run away from her forever, Anna.

914
00:53:22.375 --> 00:53:23.500
Bye.

915

[loud club ambience]

916
00:53:53.041 --> 00:53:54.166
Watch the back.

917
00:53:54.333 --> 00:53:56.083

Do you see her?

921
00:54:25.416 --> 00:54:26.416
[woman] Negative.

922
00:54:43.625 --> 00:54:44.791

or dead.

OK, listen to me. Yes, I lied.

Dave, I never fell out of love with you.

1013
01:01:40.958 --> 01:01:44.375
And I never fell out of love with you.
I don't think I could if I wanted to.

Do not contact me.
I'm going to contact you.

1040
01:03:06.791 --> 01:03:08.625
I need you to call me back.

1041
01:03:26.791 --> 01:03:29.625
I'm sorry, are you with...

1042
01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:31.958
[driver] Jack Dawson?

1043
01:03:34.458 --> 01:03:35.625
Yeah.

1044
01:03:36.208 --> 01:03:37.708
That's me.

1045
01:03:37.875 --> 01:03:39.750
[energetic music]

1046
01:04:04.833 --> 01:04:06.708
[jukebox playing soft music]

1047
01:04:20.583 --> 01:04:22.458
[In German] Something to drink?

1048
01:04:23.041 --> 01:04:25.291
[in English] Yeah um... Diet Coke?

1049
01:04:26.291 --> 01:04:27.833
Coke light.

1050
01:04:35.041 --> 01:04:36.208
Thank you.

1051
01:04:42.583 --> 01:04:44.434
[bartender in German]
<i>What do you want to drink?</i>

1052
01:04:44.458 --> 01:04:45.625
[Emma] <i>Coffee, please. Black.</i>

1053
01:04:46.333 --> 01:04:47.541
<i>Sure.</i>

1054
01:05:12.916 --> 01:05:14.208
[sighs]

1055
01:05:17.916 --> 01:05:19.208
This is a lot.

1056
01:05:23.125 --> 01:05:24.291
Where are the kids?

1057
01:05:26.375 --> 01:05:27.541
With Molly.

1058
01:05:27.958 --> 01:05:29.333
She must hate us.

1059
01:05:29.958 --> 01:05:30.958
She does.

1060
01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:36.833
My name is Anna.

1061
01:05:37.958 --> 01:05:39.000
I kill people for money.

1062
01:05:40.333 --> 01:05:42.434
There was something
I was trying to do a long time ago.

1063
01:05:42.458 --> 01:05:43.666
You kill people?

1064
01:05:44.625 --> 01:05:46.708
[bartender in German]
<i>Here's your coffee.</i>

1065
01:05:46.875 --> 01:05:47.708
<i>Danke.</i>

1066
01:05:47.875 --> 01:05:50.458
[stutters] So, what? Were we y-your cover?

1067
01:05:50.625 --> 01:05:51.958
No. No. Never.

1068
01:05:52.125 --> 01:05:55.083
- You just left us!
- I didn't leave you, OK?

1069
01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:56.458
I needed to...

1070
01:05:56.875 --> 01:05:58.708
I needed to make arrangements.

1071
01:06:08.250 --> 01:06:09.500
We're Canadian?

1072
01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:12.583
Was there anything
that you have ever said to me

1073
01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:14.125
that was the truth?

1074
01:06:14.958 --> 01:06:16.416
Your parents?

1075
01:06:16.833 --> 01:06:19.250
Your aunt in San Diego?

1076
01:06:28.333 --> 01:06:29.791
I was born in the States.

1077
01:06:31.083 --> 01:06:32.443
My dad was a Secret Service agent,

1078
01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:35.208
turned ex-Secret Service agent
way before he would have liked.

1079
01:06:35.375 --> 01:06:37.250
So he went into business for himself,

1080
01:06:37.708 --> 01:06:40.708
started a private security company
named Sovereign.

1081
01:06:40.875 --> 01:06:43.041
With an intelligence agent
named Gwen Carver.

1082
01:06:43.208 --> 01:06:47.416
Gwen Carver is investigating you.
Some kind of international task force.

1083
01:06:47.583 --> 01:06:49.791
[Emma] There is no task force,
that's Sovereign.

1084
01:06:49.958 --> 01:06:52.250
All the more reach,
more cover, the better.

1085
01:06:53.458 --> 01:06:55.291
Now that my dad is killed,
she took me in.

1086
01:06:55.458 --> 01:06:58.708
You know,
she gave me a life. She trained me.

1087
01:06:59.333 --> 01:07:00.813
She told me they were all bad people.

1088
01:07:00.875 --> 01:07:03.333
I was so young and she manipulated me.

1089
01:07:03.833 --> 01:07:05.625
I know now that she was lying.

1090
01:07:06.375 --> 01:07:08.375
I probably knew back then.
I just didn't want to...

1091
01:07:08.625 --> 01:07:10.041
admit it to myself.

1092
01:07:10.833 --> 01:07:12.333
Anyway, I did a job in Boston.

1093
01:07:13.166 --> 01:07:15.125
That's when I met you in that bar.

1094
01:07:16.750 --> 01:07:19.125
You talked to me like I was a real person.

1095
01:07:19.458 --> 01:07:22.458
You made me laugh.
You made me want to start a new life.

1096
01:07:23.291 --> 01:07:25.291
You were never my cover, Dave.

1097
01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:29.666
You were the first person
I ever truly loved. Wyatt was the second.

1098
01:07:29.833 --> 01:07:32.434
It was the most magical, warmest life
I ever could have dreamed of.

1099
01:07:32.458 --> 01:07:34.500
A life I never even thought I could have.

1100
01:07:34.916 --> 01:07:37.750
I got pregnant, and there was Caroline.
It was like this perfect life.

1101
01:07:37.916 --> 01:07:39.166
But you never stopped!

1102
01:07:39.333 --> 01:07:41.750
It was only once or twice a year
at first, I swear.

1103
01:07:41.916 --> 01:07:43.791
It was to fund our protection.

1104
01:07:44.583 --> 01:07:45.708
The work trips.

1105
01:07:46.916 --> 01:07:47.916
Nebraska?

1106
01:07:49.166 --> 01:07:50.166
Buenos Aires.

1107
01:07:51.208 --> 01:07:52.333
St. Louis?

1108
01:07:54.166 --> 01:07:55.375
Riyad, I think.

1109
01:07:56.750 --> 01:08:00.041
Dave it's my job, OK? It's what I do.

1110
01:08:00.208 --> 01:08:02.666
- I don't know how to do anything else.
- Then take a class!

1111
01:08:02.833 --> 01:08:04.673
I know, you're right.
I should do that, I know.

1112
01:08:05.333 --> 01:08:07.809
I'm going to. Listen, it's done.
I don't want to do this anymore.

1113
01:08:07.833 --> 01:08:08.993
Dave, look at me. I miss you.

1114
01:08:09.083 --> 01:08:10.916
I miss doing the crossword puzzle
together.

1115
01:08:11.083 --> 01:08:13.875
I miss sitting on the couch
watching Pixar movies with the kids,

1116
01:08:14.041 --> 01:08:15.666
throwing candy in the popcorn.

1117
01:08:16.083 --> 01:08:17.559
I miss having sex with you in our bed

1118
01:08:17.583 --> 01:08:19.309
before we had to schedule it
on the calendar.

1119
01:08:19.333 --> 01:08:20.500
OK...

1120
01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:34.208
- I love you.
- I know. I love you too.

1121
01:08:34.375 --> 01:08:35.916
I love our family.

1122
01:08:37.541 --> 01:08:38.833
But killing is bad.

1123
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.500
Like, unacceptably bad.

1124
01:08:40.666 --> 01:08:43.583
I know, I know. I'm done. Done.
I swear it's over.

1125
01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:46.333
I just have to tie up
a few loose ends, and then I promise...

1126
01:08:46.750 --> 01:08:47.791
It's over.

1127
01:08:50.875 --> 01:08:52.708
[suspenseful music]

1128
01:09:02.833 --> 01:09:04.375
[Emma] Don't worry, I have a plan.

1129
01:09:05.083 --> 01:09:07.875
You stay calm and do what they say.
I know what I'm doing.

1130
01:09:10.166 --> 01:09:11.166
Dave, this is Ji.

1131
01:09:11.291 --> 01:09:13.291
We grew up together. Practically sisters.

1132
01:09:13.791 --> 01:09:16.041
She was the super fun one,
as you could tell.

1133
01:09:16.208 --> 01:09:17.458
Hi, Anna.

1134
01:09:17.625 --> 01:09:20.458
We're kind of in the middle
of a private conversation here,

1135
01:09:20.625 --> 01:09:22.083
if you guys don't mind, so...

1136
01:09:22.708 --> 01:09:24.708
- Time to go.
- [Emma] Um...

1137
01:09:24.875 --> 01:09:26.958
I'm not finished with my coffee.

1138
01:09:27.125 --> 01:09:29.886
So if you and your boyfriend
and your little friends want to head off,

1139
01:09:30.041 --> 01:09:32.875
we'll... catch up with you later.

1140
01:09:37.166 --> 01:09:38.583
Hey! Get your hands off...

1141
01:09:38.750 --> 01:09:40.083
[screams]

1142
01:09:41.208 --> 01:09:42.625
- [pistol shot]
- [Emma] Ouch!

1143
01:09:45.541 --> 01:09:46.541
[pistol shot]

1144
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.833
[Emma panting]

1145
01:09:51.041 --> 01:09:52.166
[Emma] Ow!

1146
01:09:54.250 --> 01:09:56.666
[breathing heavily]

1147
01:10:12.916 --> 01:10:14.208
[groans]

1148
01:10:22.041 --> 01:10:24.666
[mysterious music]

1149
01:10:28.041 --> 01:10:29.541
[sighs]

1150
01:10:48.375 --> 01:10:51.583
[Caroline an Wyatt talking at distance]

1151
01:10:55.166 --> 01:10:57.458
[puppy barking]

1152
01:11:06.333 --> 01:11:09.916
[Carver] <i>How could anyone not love
your furry little friend?</i>

1153
01:11:11.083 --> 01:11:12.791
[Carver laughs]

1154
01:11:16.708 --> 01:11:18.916
[Carver] Let me see, you're so cute.

1155
01:11:19.875 --> 01:11:22.000
- [Wyatt] Mom.
- [Caroline] Mom!

1156
01:11:22.166 --> 01:11:24.500
- Hi! You guys OK?
- [Caroline] Yeah.

1157
01:11:24.833 --> 01:11:25.833
How did you...

1158
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.583
They've had a long trip.

1159
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.541
Now we're reunited.

1160
01:11:29.708 --> 01:11:31.125
That's all that matters.

1161
01:11:31.291 --> 01:11:34.333
You never told us we had an extra grandma.

1162
01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:35.916
No, I didn't. Where's Dave?

1163
01:11:36.083 --> 01:11:39.875
Oh, yeah. Daddy is resting.
He's not feeling his best.

1164
01:11:41.708 --> 01:11:42.708
Should we talk elsewhere?

1165
01:11:42.791 --> 01:11:44.000
No, I'm good right here.

1166
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000
OK.

1167
01:11:46.541 --> 01:11:49.250
Just don't hold on too tight. [laughs]

1168
01:11:49.833 --> 01:11:51.208
Don't want to suffocate them.

1169
01:11:51.375 --> 01:11:53.291
What does suffocate mean?

1170
01:11:53.458 --> 01:11:55.041
I'll tell you later, baby.

1171
01:11:55.208 --> 01:11:57.833
[Carver]
Kids? Mommy and I need to talk, so...

1172
01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.750
Would you guys like to see
this really cool

1173
01:12:00.916 --> 01:12:03.541
and very fun little playhouse

1174
01:12:03.708 --> 01:12:05.666
that we have set up for you?

1175
01:12:06.291 --> 01:12:08.731
- Can we bring the puppy?
- [Carver laughs] Of course you can!

1176
01:12:08.958 --> 01:12:10.291
He's yours, right?

1177
01:12:10.666 --> 01:12:12.208
If your mother allows it.

1178
01:12:15.041 --> 01:12:17.250
Of course you can bring the puppy. Yay!

1179
01:12:17.416 --> 01:12:21.416
And let's set up that video game system,
OK Carlo?

1180
01:12:21.833 --> 01:12:23.041
Go on.

1181
01:12:25.041 --> 01:12:26.875
- [Caroline squeals joyfully]
- [Carver] Yay!

1182
01:12:32.125 --> 01:12:33.125
Tea?

1183
01:12:34.416 --> 01:12:36.166
[breathing heavily]

1184
01:12:41.916 --> 01:12:45.083
[Caroline]
The unicorn wanted to see the queen

1185
01:12:45.250 --> 01:12:47.250
because she was that rainbow.

1186
01:12:47.416 --> 01:12:51.833
She wanted to make the unicorn
even prettier

1187
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.166
because she wanted her to be a statue
for her castle.

1188
01:12:55.333 --> 01:12:58.083
So I think that's because the queen is...

1189
01:12:58.250 --> 01:13:00.166
[Emma]
<i>You didn't have to bring them into this.</i>

1190
01:13:03.375 --> 01:13:04.750
You brought them into this.

1191
01:13:06.375 --> 01:13:08.791
Really, Anna.
Your plan was a little crude.

1192
01:13:08.958 --> 01:13:10.684
Of course, you knew
Dave was going to lead us

1193
01:13:10.708 --> 01:13:12.208
right to you. Huh?

1194
01:13:12.375 --> 01:13:14.500
For you to extract
whatever blunt sort of revenge

1195
01:13:14.666 --> 01:13:15.958
you had in mind.

1196
01:13:16.458 --> 01:13:18.833
And, of course,
we were going to take the kids.

1197
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.208
[Carver laughs]

1198
01:13:20.375 --> 01:13:23.375
Did you really think
it was going to be as simple as all that?

1199
01:13:24.625 --> 01:13:26.583
The kids are fine

1200
01:13:27.583 --> 01:13:30.500
if the video games and the dog
don't keep them occupied,

1201
01:13:30.666 --> 01:13:32.333
well, there's ping pong.

1202
01:13:33.166 --> 01:13:36.833
Not that you're teaching them the benefit
of physical exercise.

1203
01:13:37.916 --> 01:13:39.596
[sighs] The way you're raising them, Anna.

1204
01:13:39.625 --> 01:13:40.625
Emma.

1205
01:13:42.708 --> 01:13:44.375
Emma. [chuckles]

1206
01:13:45.166 --> 01:13:46.458
You barely even changed it.

1207
01:13:46.625 --> 01:13:47.916
My name is Emma.

1208
01:13:49.791 --> 01:13:51.083
OK.

1209
01:13:52.041 --> 01:13:54.416
I see you, hm?

1210
01:13:55.375 --> 01:13:56.791
I hear you.

1211
01:13:57.416 --> 01:13:59.166
Is that what you need?

1212
01:13:59.833 --> 01:14:01.333
You've acted out

1213
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:02.958
all for what?

1214
01:14:03.375 --> 01:14:05.791
So you could pick out dishwasher pods
at Target

1215
01:14:05.958 --> 01:14:08.541
with Dave from New Jersey?

1216
01:14:08.708 --> 01:14:10.250
Yeah, I like New Jersey

1217
01:14:10.416 --> 01:14:12.333
and I love my family.

1218
01:14:13.041 --> 01:14:14.541
I just want a normal life.

1219
01:14:14.708 --> 01:14:16.375
[Carver] You just want a normal life

1220
01:14:16.875 --> 01:14:19.458
while you're dropping bodies
from Athens to Zimbabwe.

1221
01:14:19.625 --> 01:14:22.000
- I'm not doing that anymore.
- Is that what you told him?

1222
01:14:22.166 --> 01:14:24.166
Yeah. I'm fucking done with all of it.
All of you!

1223
01:14:25.375 --> 01:14:27.458
[Carver] Please, Anna. The language...

1224
01:14:27.625 --> 01:14:28.875
[Emma] Fuck you.

1225
01:14:29.583 --> 01:14:32.583
You took me.
You're not going to take my kids.

1226
01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:35.375
Oh, please. They were given to me.

1227
01:14:35.958 --> 01:14:38.416
Your sister in law was very concerned

1228
01:14:38.583 --> 01:14:40.903
though I think is reassured
that the authorities had it all

1229
01:14:41.041 --> 01:14:42.041
well in hand.

1230
01:14:42.125 --> 01:14:44.166
The ITIC and all that.

1231
01:14:44.666 --> 01:14:46.625
And I never took you, Anna.

1232
01:14:46.791 --> 01:14:48.333
[laughs] I took you in!

1233
01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:50.750
- I was a child.
- [Carver] Stop.

1234
01:14:50.916 --> 01:14:53.375
Stop with the self-pity.

1235
01:14:53.875 --> 01:14:55.458
You're better than that.

1236
01:14:56.208 --> 01:14:57.750
At least you were.

1237
01:15:06.625 --> 01:15:09.291
Don't. I don't wanna see... don't.

1238
01:15:13.625 --> 01:15:15.000
Look at that girl.

1239
01:15:15.875 --> 01:15:16.916
Look at her strength.

1240
01:15:17.666 --> 01:15:18.666
Her power.

1241
01:15:18.750 --> 01:15:20.958
I gave those things to you.

1242
01:15:21.708 --> 01:15:23.583
That makes you mine,

1243
01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:25.958
always.

1244
01:15:28.708 --> 01:15:30.166
What do you want from me?

1245
01:15:30.333 --> 01:15:32.625
You know what I want.

1246
01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:35.125
I want you back.

1247
01:15:35.291 --> 01:15:37.250
We can all be a family.

1248
01:15:37.416 --> 01:15:38.833
Don't you see?

1249
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.166
And it's the only way for

1250
01:15:42.250 --> 01:15:44.291
your children to have a future,

1251
01:15:44.875 --> 01:15:45.916
to have a life

1252
01:15:46.083 --> 01:15:47.958
with you in it.

1253
01:15:53.083 --> 01:15:55.791
You only need to get rid of Dave.

1254
01:15:59.416 --> 01:16:00.708
Just one bullet.

1255
01:16:00.875 --> 01:16:03.708
Even off your game,
I can't imagine you'd need more than that.

1256
01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:06.750
Thank you.

1257
01:16:16.125 --> 01:16:18.291
[Dave moaning]

1258
01:16:23.625 --> 01:16:26.791
Why don't you just do it?
If that's what you want. You do it.

1259
01:16:28.125 --> 01:16:29.750
I didn't bring him into this.

1260
01:16:31.791 --> 01:16:32.791
Hm...

1261
01:16:33.250 --> 01:16:36.458
This will put us on a better footing
to move forward together

1262
01:16:37.166 --> 01:16:38.500
as a family.

1263
01:16:39.166 --> 01:16:40.500
Your real family.

1264
01:16:41.833 --> 01:16:44.708
What if I pick it up,
put it in your face and pull the trigger?

1265
01:16:45.625 --> 01:16:49.375
Why don't do you think about
your children?

1266
01:16:49.833 --> 01:16:51.541
For once.

1267
01:16:52.333 --> 01:16:54.250
God knows I think about you.

1268
01:16:56.208 --> 01:16:57.500
My sweet girl.

1269
01:17:05.291 --> 01:17:06.458
Now.

1270
01:17:07.791 --> 01:17:09.583
Take him for a walk.

1271
01:17:10.875 --> 01:17:12.708
A walk in the woods.

1272
01:17:15.958 --> 01:17:17.458
[whispers] Don't make me do this.

1273
01:17:17.625 --> 01:17:19.541
Shall I entertain the kids
while you're gone?

1274
01:17:20.083 --> 01:17:21.125
No.

1275
01:17:21.291 --> 01:17:23.666
- [Carver] We could play a game.
- No.

1276
01:17:23.833 --> 01:17:26.041
- I could read them a story.
- No.

1277
01:17:26.208 --> 01:17:28.708
Those perfect little darlings.

1278
01:17:28.875 --> 01:17:31.083
I have so much I can teach them.

1279
01:17:32.541 --> 01:17:34.041
There is always a price.

1280
01:17:35.125 --> 01:17:37.708
- There's always a sacrifice.
- [whispers] Don't make me do this.

1281
01:17:37.875 --> 01:17:40.458
I can forgive the worry you've caused.

1282
01:17:40.625 --> 01:17:43.500
- Stop.
- [Carver] But you have to meet me halfway.

1283
01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.458
And this is how you do it.

1284
01:17:50.583 --> 01:17:52.166
Now take him for a walk.

1285
01:17:54.458 --> 01:17:56.250
A walk in the woods.

1286
01:18:06.875 --> 01:18:08.666
I don't want them anywhere near it.

1287
01:18:09.708 --> 01:18:11.208
My sweet girl.

1288
01:18:13.833 --> 01:18:15.291
[crows cawing]

1289
01:18:21.666 --> 01:18:23.583
[indistinct radio chatter]

1290
01:18:24.041 --> 01:18:25.333
Where are we?

1291
01:18:28.666 --> 01:18:30.125
Let's go for a walk.

1292
01:18:34.125 --> 01:18:35.416
OK.

1293
01:18:37.458 --> 01:18:38.916
[Dave] What is this place?

1294
01:18:41.125 --> 01:18:43.205
- [Emma] Dave, there's a sniper on us.
- [Dave] What?

1295
01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:45.291
[Emma] It's fine. She's always watching.

1296
01:18:45.458 --> 01:18:47.138
Listen Dave, I need to tell you something.

1297
01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:49.250
Tell me something, anything.

1298
01:18:50.333 --> 01:18:51.666
She has the kids.

1299
01:18:51.833 --> 01:18:54.666
They're OK. Stop.
They're fine. Calm down.

1300
01:18:55.250 --> 01:18:57.083
- Where are they?
- They're fine.

1301
01:18:57.250 --> 01:18:58.750
They are not hurt. They are happy.

1302
01:18:58.916 --> 01:19:00.833
They have no idea what's going on.

1303
01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.125
What are we gonna do?

1304
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:04.416
Emma, what the hell is wrong with you?

1305
01:19:04.583 --> 01:19:06.583
They have our kids.
What are we gonna do?

1306
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:15.083
Can you hold me?

1307
01:19:15.916 --> 01:19:16.916
Huh?

1308
01:19:17.041 --> 01:19:19.125
You know,
can you hold me like you used to?

1309
01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:22.625
Before all this shit.
Can you just hold me, please?

1310
01:19:23.375 --> 01:19:24.583
- [Emma] Please!
- I mean...

1311
01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:26.291
- [Emma] Now.
- OK.

1312
01:19:27.833 --> 01:19:29.250
Oh, OK.

1313
01:19:30.916 --> 01:19:32.291
OK.

1314
01:19:32.458 --> 01:19:33.625
OK. OK.

1315
01:19:35.458 --> 01:19:36.458
[Dave] Emma,

1316
01:19:37.791 --> 01:19:39.375
what the hell is going on?

1317
01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:41.125
[whispers] She wants me to kill you.

1318
01:19:41.291 --> 01:19:42.291
What?

1319
01:19:45.958 --> 01:19:48.083
- I'm sorry.
- Emma, I love you...

1320
01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:49.708
- [gunshot]
- Ah!

1321
01:19:51.125 --> 01:19:53.041
[music intensifies]

1322
01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:54.791
[Dave groans]

1323
01:20:00.458 --> 01:20:02.333
[music fades away]

1324
01:20:15.291 --> 01:20:17.000
[vehicle approaching]

1325
01:20:25.791 --> 01:20:27.125
[motor stops]

1326
01:20:27.291 --> 01:20:29.125
[ominous music]

1327
01:20:29.291 --> 01:20:31.166
[indistinct radio chatter]

1328
01:20:32.208 --> 01:20:33.291
Confirming the kill.

1329
01:21:00.916 --> 01:21:02.583
Wanna give me a hand or what?

1330
01:21:06.666 --> 01:21:07.791
Bitch.

1331
01:21:14.208 --> 01:21:15.458
[both yell]

1332
01:21:16.666 --> 01:21:17.750
[gunshot]

1333
01:21:29.875 --> 01:21:31.083
[coughs]

1334
01:21:36.833 --> 01:21:37.875
[groans]

1335
01:21:52.291 --> 01:21:53.875
[cries out]

1336
01:21:57.291 --> 01:21:58.833
[groans loudly]

1337
01:22:05.541 --> 01:22:07.708
[music swells]

1338
01:22:07.875 --> 01:22:10.208
[Dave] Emma, what the hell is going on?

1339
01:22:13.458 --> 01:22:16.333
- [whispers] She wants me to kill you.
- What?

1340
01:22:16.833 --> 01:22:18.958
I'm not going to.

1341
01:22:19.125 --> 01:22:20.750
It's a clean shot.

1342
01:22:20.916 --> 01:22:22.458
No vitals.

1343
01:22:22.625 --> 01:22:23.833
I know what I'm doing.

1344
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.333
Trust me.

1345
01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:27.458
And play dead.

1346
01:22:27.625 --> 01:22:29.458
- Huh?
- I'm sorry.

1347
01:22:29.625 --> 01:22:30.905
- Emma, I love you...
- [gunshot]

1348
01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.280
- [Emma] Hello there.
- [gunshot]

1349
01:22:49.166 --> 01:22:51.208
[footsteps]

1350
01:22:51.625 --> 01:22:53.250
Hey, hey, babe.

1351
01:22:53.416 --> 01:22:54.583
Babe, hey.

1352
01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:56.375
It's me. You can move. Hey.

1353
01:22:56.875 --> 01:22:59.291
- Oh my God, are you OK?
- You really shot me!

1354
01:22:59.458 --> 01:23:01.916
I know, I'm so sorry. Does it hurt?

1355
01:23:02.583 --> 01:23:05.041
- [groans loudly]
- Oh, God. Let me see. OK, listen.

1356
01:23:05.208 --> 01:23:06.833
You just have to apply pressure.

1357
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.583
- It is a slow bleed.
- OK.

1358
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:11.184
We get you to the hospital
in four or five hours. You'll be fine.

1359
01:23:11.208 --> 01:23:12.541
- What?
- [Emma] Yeah.

1360
01:23:13.125 --> 01:23:15.500
- [groans]
- [Emma] OK come here.

1361
01:23:15.666 --> 01:23:16.958
I'm gonna get this off you.

1362
01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:20.791
- [Emma] OK.
- [groans]

1363
01:23:20.958 --> 01:23:22.416
- [Emma] Can you get up?
- No.

1364
01:23:22.583 --> 01:23:24.958
Yes, you can. Come on,
I'll help you. Let me help you.

1365
01:23:25.125 --> 01:23:26.625
- Just give me a sec.
- Sorry.

1366
01:23:26.791 --> 01:23:27.791
- OK.
- Come on.

1367
01:23:27.833 --> 01:23:28.875
[Dave screams]

1368
01:23:29.708 --> 01:23:31.166
- [Emma] Oh, sorry.
- OK.

1369
01:23:31.333 --> 01:23:32.333
- You OK?
- Mm-hm.

1370
01:23:32.416 --> 01:23:33.416
OK babe, listen to me.

1371
01:23:33.541 --> 01:23:35.166
I'm so sorry.

1372
01:23:35.333 --> 01:23:36.750
I have to go to work now though.

1373
01:23:36.916 --> 01:23:38.041
- OK.
- OK?

1374
01:23:38.208 --> 01:23:39.808
- You're coming with me.
- [upbeat music]

1375
01:23:39.833 --> 01:23:40.833
- Are you ready?
- OK.

1376
01:23:40.958 --> 01:23:41.998
- [dispiritedly] No.
- Yes.

1377
01:23:42.083 --> 01:23:43.642
I love you. Just stay close. We got this.

1378
01:23:43.666 --> 01:23:44.500
[Dave] OK.

1379
01:23:44.666 --> 01:23:46.500
- I love you.
- I love you.

1380
01:23:46.666 --> 01:23:47.833
- OK. Come on.
- You shot me!

1381
01:23:49.458 --> 01:23:50.500
[Emma] Come on.

1382
01:24:01.708 --> 01:24:02.875
[muffled gunshot]

1383
01:24:05.708 --> 01:24:08.333
OK. Yeah. Let's go, come on.

1384
01:24:11.666 --> 01:24:12.916
[groans]

1385
01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:26.000
Shit. Come here. Quiet. Quiet.

1386
01:24:26.166 --> 01:24:27.750
- Ouch!
- Sorry.

1387

[Emma] OK.

1388
01:24:30.583 --> 01:24:32.250
Stay low and don't look.

1389
01:24:32.416 --> 01:24:33.583
OK. What?

1390
01:24:38.916 --> 01:24:40.083

You're OK?

1394
01:24:55.875 --> 01:24:56.708
What happened?

1395
01:24:56.875 --> 01:24:59.517
Listen, I know this is a lot,
but I need you now. I need you to focus.

1396
01:24:59.541 --> 01:25:01.375
- I need you.
- OK. OK, I'm here.

1397

OK. Listen to me.

1398

The kids are back there
in the guest house.

1399
01:25:04.458 --> 01:25:05.458
I need to go right there.

1400
01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:07.642
- You go to the kids and buy some time.
- Buy some time?

1401
01:25:07.666 --> 01:25:09.851
You're going to take this with you.
It's point and shoot.

1402
01:25:09.875 --> 01:25:10.916
Got it. Point and shoot.

1403
01:25:11.083 --> 01:25:12.892
- With any luck you're not gonna need it.
- OK.

1404

- Buy some time.

I need to you buy some time.
I'll be right there.

[Carver]
What do you mean, there's no response?

1410
01:25:33.041 --> 01:25:35.375
I just hope
she's not being emotional about this.

1412

[painfully] God... Ow...

1424
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.541
We're kind of having quite an adventure,
aren't we?

1425
01:27:56.041 --> 01:27:58.041

- [Caroline] Daddy?
- [Dave] Yeah?

1428
01:28:08.208 --> 01:28:10.791
Are you sure you don't need a Band-Aid?

1429
01:28:13.666 --> 01:28:14.875
I'm fine.

1430
01:28:16.375 --> 01:28:17.708

[Emma] Thought you were a better shot.

1436
01:29:34.875 --> 01:29:36.791
We don't have to do this, you know.

1437
01:29:37.666 --> 01:29:39.000
It's not too late.

1438
01:29:40.375 --> 01:29:41.750
We can still make this work.

1439
01:29:44.708 --> 01:29:46.208
I do love you, Anna.

1440
01:29:51.250 --> 01:29:53.041
[Emma] You know I can see you, right?

1441
01:29:55.625 --> 01:29:59.041
I'm still the same woman
who put you in your jammies, remember?

1442
01:29:59.875 --> 01:30:01.208
Tucked you in at night.

1443

1444
01:30:05.041 --> 01:30:07.958
[Emma] Oh Gwen, I remember everything.

1445
01:30:08.583 --> 01:30:09.833
See how well you taught me?

[snickers]

1450
01:30:31.333 --> 01:30:34.333
I know you're older now,
so stop acting like a child.

1451
01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:36.250
- [Emma] Make me.

01:30:44.291 --> 01:30:46.500
That's enough, Anna.

1454
01:30:47.291 --> 01:30:49.541
[Emma] That might be it
for your clip, Gwen.

1455
01:30:51.333 --> 01:30:52.333
Fuck.

1456
01:30:52.458 --> 01:30:53.541

[Carver] That's what I like to see.

1464
01:31:33.250 --> 01:31:34.666
Finish me.

1465
01:31:41.041 --> 01:31:42.250
Finish me.

1466
01:31:50.166 --> 01:31:52.416
I would love to sit here
and watch you die.

1467
01:31:52.583 --> 01:31:55.666
But Mr. Fluff
and the Monkey Princess are feuding

1468
01:31:55.833 --> 01:31:58.541

Hi! Time to go, OK?

- [Caroline] Do we have to?
- [Emma] Yes.

1474
01:32:29.208 --> 01:32:30.768
But Mom, we're in the middle of a race.

1475
01:32:30.833 --> 01:32:33.375
You heard your mom. Time to go.
Get your things, come on.

1476
01:32:33.541 --> 01:32:35.291
Babe are you OK? Any problems?

1477
01:32:35.458 --> 01:32:37.666
- Nothing I couldn't handle.
- OK.

You?

1479

[sighs] Done, done.

1482
01:32:45.083 --> 01:32:46.333
- [Caroline] Mommy?
- Yes, baby?

1483
01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:48.458
Did you cut yourself on a tree

1484
01:32:48.625 --> 01:32:50.000
like Daddy?

1485
01:32:50.166 --> 01:32:53.333
Yes, I did. It was an accident.
I'll going to tell you about in the car.

1486
01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:55.517
Let's go. Grab your jackets.
Wyatt, put the game down.

Really? We can keep him?

Well, pick him up before I change my mind.
Shhh. Grab your jackets.

Let's go. Let's go. Jackets. Jackets.

1492
01:33:06.166 --> 01:33:07.326
[Wyatt] Can we get ice cream?

1493
01:33:07.416 --> 01:33:09.041
Come on. Come on.

1494
01:33:09.833 --> 01:33:11.291
What's wrong with Carlo?

1495
01:33:12.916 --> 01:33:15.000
Carlo's sleeping,
we don't want to wake him up.

1496
01:33:15.166 --> 01:33:16.458
So bye Carlo.

1497

We're gonna get you one babe.

I need my car seat.

Honey, don't worry.
This is just for a little bit, OK?

How did you guys get those marks?

1505
01:33:41.125 --> 01:33:42.765
I don't think you guys got cut by a tree.

1506

- No.
- No, no.

Some other guys. Some bad guys.

It's illegal for me
to not be in a car seat.

I know honey. Listen, we have to get Daddy
to a doctor right now,

Yes, I did.
But we got to get Daddy to a doctor.

1514
01:34:01.125 --> 01:34:03.333
Then I'm going to get you a car seat
and then ice cream.
