1
00:02:45.167 --> 00:02:46.833
- Want toast?
- Yes.

2
00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:48.625
Ellie, where's your cereal bowl?

3
00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:50.625
- I'm not hungry.
- You need to eat.

4
00:02:50.667 --> 00:02:53.542
- I'm not hungry, Mom.
- You need to eat before school.

5
00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:55.583
- One more bite.
- You want jelly?

6
00:02:55.667 --> 00:02:57.292
Yes, please.

7
00:02:57.333 --> 00:03:00.458
Watch it, Brenda.
Don't mess my clothes up.

8
00:03:00.542 --> 00:03:02.500
Billy Baker's in my class this year.

9
00:03:02.583 --> 00:03:04.542
- Oh, did he flunk too?
- Shut up!

10
00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:07.167
- Hey!
- You're one to talk.

11
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.167
- Are you excited about school?
- Yeah.

12
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.167
- Isn't your sister cute?
- You stink.

13
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.333
Very cute.

14
00:03:13.417 --> 00:03:16.375
He stinks. He's gotta shower
before he eats with us.

15
00:03:16.458 --> 00:03:18.625
Stop picking
on your brother and eat.

16
00:03:22.542 --> 00:03:23.667
May Belle?

17
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.875
- Honey, here's your juice.
- Thanks.

18
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.458
OK, who hid my sneakers?

19
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.000
Jess, you could hardly call them
sneakers anymore. I threw them out.

20
00:03:33.083 --> 00:03:34.750
What? Mom!

21
00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:38.708
Sorry, but I will not send any child of
mine to school looking like some hobo.

22
00:03:38.792 --> 00:03:42.167
There's a perfectly good old pair
of Brenda's I put out for you.

23
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.208
These are girls' ones.

24
00:03:45.292 --> 00:03:47.958
It's the fan belt this time,
but I got another.

25
00:03:48.042 --> 00:03:50.625
- Bye-bye.
- Ellie? Honey, here you go.

26
00:03:50.708 --> 00:03:53.292
- What's the matter?
- There's a big race today.

27
00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:55.417
- And?
- My sneakers.

28
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.667
- I got a perfectly good pair for him.
- These are girls' ones.

29
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.833
- I can't race in these.
- You couldn't race in your old ones.

30
00:04:01.917 --> 00:04:03.917
He needs some new sneakers, Mary.

31
00:04:05.167 --> 00:04:08.667
- Catch Billy's eye in that.
- We don't have anything for extras.

32
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.750
- Excuse me?
- You're excused.

33
00:04:11.833 --> 00:04:14.542
They make them the same.
You got your chores done?

34
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.417
Just about to.

35
00:04:55.417 --> 00:04:59.125
I try to keep my pit stops
under ten seconds, ace.

36
00:05:00.208 --> 00:05:02.000
Give it to me.

37
00:05:02.042 --> 00:05:04.417
- Give it...
- Hey, that's my lunch!

38
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.917
I found it!

39
00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:11.375
You're kidding me.

40
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.667
OK, that's enough.

41
00:05:14.042 --> 00:05:16.583
Consider it a free lunch program,
farmer boy!

42
00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:18.375
All right, settle down.

43
00:05:19.167 --> 00:05:20.500
Good one, Janice.

44
00:05:20.542 --> 00:05:23.333
What do you call your teacher?
I wanna tell Alexandra.

45
00:05:23.375 --> 00:05:26.000
- "Monster Mouth. " Now scoot.
- Alexandra,

46
00:05:26.083 --> 00:05:31.042
- they call her "Monster Mouth" Myers.
- I said scoot!

47
00:05:31.292 --> 00:05:33.042
A few ground rules for this classroom.

48
00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:37.333
No talking. No chewing gum.
No electronic devices. Be forewarned.

49
00:05:37.417 --> 00:05:39.583
If you download essays
off the Internet,

50
00:05:39.667 --> 00:05:42.583
you'll be downloaded into detention.

51
00:05:42.667 --> 00:05:46.333
Let's start the year off on
the right foot and all do our own work.

52
00:05:46.417 --> 00:05:49.292
- I expect you to take notes.
- Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,

53
00:05:49.375 --> 00:05:53.583
Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep.
Know what that is? My loser detector.

54
00:05:55.833 --> 00:05:57.083
Jesse Aarons!

55
00:05:58.292 --> 00:06:01.333
I got it from your sisters.
I do not need it from you.

56
00:06:01.375 --> 00:06:03.708
- Oh, man.
- That goes for you as well.

57
00:06:03.792 --> 00:06:05.292
He hit me.

58
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.667
- You're dead meat.
- Scott Hoager and Gary Fulcher,

59
00:06:09.708 --> 00:06:10.750
be quiet!

60
00:06:11.375 --> 00:06:15.208
Now, back to what we were discussing
before we were so rudely interrupted.

61
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.333
Sweet sneaks, Aarons.

62
00:06:17.417 --> 00:06:20.667
You wear your sisters'
hand-me-down underwear too?

63
00:06:20.708 --> 00:06:23.833
He asked you a question,
twinkle toes.

64
00:06:27.667 --> 00:06:31.250
Good morning, kids. Welcome back.
I hope you had a great summer.

65
00:06:31.333 --> 00:06:35.042
Mrs. Myers, this is Leslie Burke,
who will be joining your class.

66
00:06:35.125 --> 00:06:39.000
- Leslie, welcome to Lark Creek.
- Thanks.

67
00:06:39.042 --> 00:06:42.667
Thank you, Principal Turner.

68
00:06:42.708 --> 00:06:45.833
Well, Leslie, um,
you'll sit at my desk this morning,

69
00:06:45.917 --> 00:06:49.083
until we can figure out
where to squeeze you in.

70
00:06:52.542 --> 00:06:55.667
I like to start the year
with a little fun.

71
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:59.417
I want you all to write a one-page
essay about your favorite hobby.

72
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.000
Yes?

73
00:07:01.042 --> 00:07:05.042
Mrs. Myers, when you say one page,
did you mean both sides of the paper?

74
00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:08.417
- You can do one side, Madison.
- I'll do two.

75
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.750
- Yeah, that's cool.
- No way!

76
00:07:11.833 --> 00:07:14.708
- It was so amazing.
- Can I have this?

77
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:18.083
You could have two bucks out of it all.
I'm getting most of it, OK?

78
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.875
- Excuse me.
- Got a dollar?

79
00:07:21.417 --> 00:07:24.167
- No.
- You're gonna have to use your pants.

80
00:07:25.375 --> 00:07:27.875
- What's your problem?
- You got that backwards.

81
00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.875
- You got the problem.
- That's right, new girl.

82
00:07:32.375 --> 00:07:35.833
- Nice feet.
- You say something?

83
00:07:35.875 --> 00:07:37.375
What I said was,

84
00:07:37.417 --> 00:07:40.875
have you ever heard the story
about the trolls under the bridges

85
00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.375
who collect tolls
from unlucky travelers?

86
00:07:43.458 --> 00:07:45.500
Trolls?
What is she talking about?

87
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.333
Nice try, beanpole.
It's still a dollar.

88
00:08:11.292 --> 00:08:12.542
Yeah!

89
00:08:14.042 --> 00:08:16.917
- Let's do it. Do it.
- Yeah, we've got Hoager.

90
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.917
Next grade, line up.
Let's do this thing. Come on.

91
00:08:22.458 --> 00:08:24.083
Fulcher, Hoager, get in here.

92
00:08:24.708 --> 00:08:27.042
Get ready.
Let's get this race started.

93
00:08:27.125 --> 00:08:28.917
- Beep, beep, beep.
- Dead meat.

94
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.583
Back behind the line. You know
how it goes. Back behind. Come on.

95
00:08:33.667 --> 00:08:36.083
Hey, new girl.
This is just for guys.

96
00:08:36.167 --> 00:08:37.833
Hey, I'm talking to you!

97
00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:40.875
What's the matter?
Afraid a girl's gonna beat you?

98
00:08:42.667 --> 00:08:45.583
- On your mark. Get set.
- Dead meat.

99
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.250
Go, Hoager!
Get in there!

100
00:09:04.417 --> 00:09:07.542
Go! Go, Jess, go!

101
00:09:10.417 --> 00:09:11.917
Come on!

102
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.792
Come on! You can do it!

103
00:09:13.875 --> 00:09:16.083
Come on, Jess!

104
00:09:16.167 --> 00:09:18.167
Go, Jess, go!

105
00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:35.542
Jess, Jess, did you win?

106
00:09:38.792 --> 00:09:41.583
Hey, Jess, right?

107
00:09:51.917 --> 00:09:54.167
- Idiot!
- What?

108
00:09:56.417 --> 00:09:58.625
- See you tomorrow.
- Ten seconds, ace.

109
00:10:05.292 --> 00:10:06.833
Thank you.

110
00:10:08.333 --> 00:10:10.708
Are you following me?

111
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.625
No. I live over there.

112
00:10:12.708 --> 00:10:15.583
We're neighbors?
You got little sisters?

113
00:10:15.667 --> 00:10:18.583
- No. Just me.
- Oh.

114
00:10:18.625 --> 00:10:20.500
You got any Barbies?

115
00:10:20.792 --> 00:10:24.042
Yeah. I think I have a few.
You got any?

116
00:10:24.083 --> 00:10:28.208
- Yeah, I have one... and a half.
- And a half?

117
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:31.500
One got cut in half
playing Super Extreme Barbies.

118
00:10:31.583 --> 00:10:33.000
Never heard of that before.

119
00:10:33.083 --> 00:10:35.042
You flush the toilet
with them in it,

120
00:10:35.083 --> 00:10:37.792
drop them from the upstairs window,
stuff like that.

121
00:10:37.875 --> 00:10:41.042
- It's really fun.
- Sounds like fun.

122
00:10:41.083 --> 00:10:44.667
- Well, I'll see you around.
- Yeah. See ya.

123
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.042
- See ya.
- Hey, guys.

124
00:10:46.083 --> 00:10:47.083
Hey, Dad.

125
00:10:47.167 --> 00:10:50.208
- I'm getting supplies. You wanna come?
- Yeah. Sure.

126
00:10:50.625 --> 00:10:52.042
See ya.

127
00:10:54.417 --> 00:10:56.833
There we go.
This'll make it feel better.

128
00:10:56.917 --> 00:11:00.042
- How come it's my fault?
- When I ask you to watch the baby,

129
00:11:00.125 --> 00:11:02.708
- I mean watch the baby, Brenda.
- It's Ellie's turn.

130
00:11:02.792 --> 00:11:05.750
- I'm doing my algebra.
- Put more cream on there.

131
00:11:05.792 --> 00:11:08.250
You girls have to start
helping out more here.

132
00:11:08.292 --> 00:11:09.958
You're not little kids anymore.

133
00:11:19.583 --> 00:11:22.708
May Belle! How many times have
I told you, stay out of my stuff.

134
00:11:22.792 --> 00:11:24.875
- It wasn't me.
- It was too you.

135
00:11:24.917 --> 00:11:27.625
- You can't prove it!
- There a problem here?

136
00:11:27.708 --> 00:11:30.000
- Daddy!
- Hey, sweetie.

137
00:11:30.083 --> 00:11:32.250
Is he picking on you?

138
00:11:33.083 --> 00:11:36.125
- She was in my stuff.
- What stuff?

139
00:11:45.542 --> 00:11:47.250
How'd that race go?

140
00:11:47.292 --> 00:11:49.875
There's this new girl
moved in next door.

141
00:11:49.917 --> 00:11:53.208
She beat all of the boys.
Even Jess.

142
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.542
Make sure you take out
the garbage before supper.

143
00:11:59.792 --> 00:12:02.875
One drop.

144
00:12:02.917 --> 00:12:06.375
And that's the magic.
Here comes May Belle's flowers.

145
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.000
Are these ever gonna grow?

146
00:12:10.083 --> 00:12:13.500
This greenhouse is gonna be filled
with your purple flowers.

147
00:12:13.583 --> 00:12:16.542
May Belle's flowers.

148
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.875
I always wanted the one
that had, like, purple all over it.

149
00:12:22.708 --> 00:12:24.708
They are so cool.

150
00:12:24.792 --> 00:12:27.250
- These things are gonna grow fast.
- Me too.

151
00:12:27.292 --> 00:12:30.167
- Tomorrow, it's gonna be filled.
- Yeah.

152
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.417
The bell's gonna ring!

153
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.958
- Good morning, everybody!
- Good morning, Ms. Edmunds!

154
00:12:37.042 --> 00:12:39.083
Aren't you glad
that summer's over?

155
00:12:39.167 --> 00:12:42.625
- No!
- No? I am.

156
00:12:42.708 --> 00:12:44.917
Come and get your instruments.

157
00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.833
- Can I play the woodblock?
- Yes.

158
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.375
Ms. Edmunds?
May I please play the castanets?

159
00:12:51.458 --> 00:12:54.667
Yes, you may.
Everybody ready for music?

160
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.917
Take a picture.
Lasts longer.

161
00:12:58.125 --> 00:13:01.333
<i>It's awfully quiet.
# Old McDonald had a farm...</i>

162
00:13:01.417 --> 00:13:04.333
- No!
- No? You don't like that song?

163
00:13:04.417 --> 00:13:06.875
- No!
- Then make some noise. Come on.

164
00:14:08.292 --> 00:14:10.625
- We saw this video yesterday.
- Whatever.

165
00:14:10.667 --> 00:14:13.417
Change it!
Give it... give it to me!

166
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.750
Stop it.
You're always fighting.

167
00:14:15.792 --> 00:14:19.208
- Wait till I get my own place.
- I wanna watch this.

168
00:14:19.292 --> 00:14:22.250
We just
can't keep going like this.

169
00:14:22.292 --> 00:14:25.667
Honey, uh... I've only got what I've got
to work with. We gotta...

170
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:28.250
You gotta figure out
a way to get down on this.

171
00:14:28.333 --> 00:14:31.292
It's a problem,
but I'm gonna try to get going.

172
00:14:31.333 --> 00:14:35.125
And maybe you can pick up
another shift at the store.

173
00:14:36.458 --> 00:14:37.917
Dead meat.

174
00:14:41.458 --> 00:14:43.417
Wow.

175
00:14:43.458 --> 00:14:46.292
You're really good at drawing.

176
00:14:46.333 --> 00:14:49.333
Like, better than any kid
I've ever seen.

177
00:14:49.417 --> 00:14:51.000
Uh... Thanks.

178
00:14:54.417 --> 00:14:57.458
I wanna share
this composition for two reasons.

179
00:14:57.542 --> 00:15:01.000
One, it uses adjectives well.
And two,

180
00:15:01.083 --> 00:15:05.833
it's clear the author paid attention
to what she saw and what she felt,

181
00:15:05.917 --> 00:15:09.417
which is important for any writing.

182
00:15:09.458 --> 00:15:14.375
<i>Self-Contained Underwater
Breathing Apparatus by Leslie Burke.</i>

183
00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:17.458
Leslie, why don't you read it for us.

184
00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:19.875
Oh, man. Can you believe this?

185
00:15:29.458 --> 00:15:31.292
"I'm moving gently forward,

186
00:15:31.542 --> 00:15:35.917
over the wild and beautiful,
unexplored world below me.

187
00:15:36.208 --> 00:15:38.458
I'm floating in silence,

188
00:15:38.792 --> 00:15:41.583
and breaking it up
with the sound of my breath.

189
00:15:41.625 --> 00:15:45.583
Above me, there's nothing
but shimmery light,

190
00:15:45.625 --> 00:15:47.625
the place where I've come from,

191
00:15:47.708 --> 00:15:50.167
and will go back to
when I am done here.

192
00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.667
I'm diving.

193
00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:55.417
I'm a scuba diver.

194
00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:59.042
I'm going deeper past
the wrinkled rocks and dark seaweed

195
00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:03.167
toward a deep blueness
where a school of silver fish wait.

196
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.167
As I swim through the water,

197
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.875
bubbles burst from me,

198
00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.833
wobbling like little jellyfish
as they rise.

199
00:16:12.917 --> 00:16:14.875
I check my air.

200
00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.917
I don't have as much time
as I need to see everything,

201
00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:20.792
but that is what makes it so special. "

202
00:16:21.667 --> 00:16:25.208
Thank you, Leslie.
Now tonight at 7:00 on channel four

203
00:16:25.292 --> 00:16:29.583
there is a special about
an undersea explorer, Dr. Bob Ballard.

204
00:16:29.667 --> 00:16:33.958
I want everyone to watch and write one
page about what you've learned.

205
00:16:34.042 --> 00:16:35.500
Leslie?

206
00:16:35.583 --> 00:16:37.708
What if you can't watch this program?

207
00:16:37.792 --> 00:16:41.375
Inform your parents it's an assignment,
I'm sure they won't object.

208
00:16:41.458 --> 00:16:44.500
But... what if you don't have a TV?

209
00:16:51.625 --> 00:16:53.750
My dad says the TV
kills your brain cells.

210
00:16:53.833 --> 00:16:58.125
Your dad doesn't know anything.
We watch TV, like, every day.

211
00:16:58.167 --> 00:17:00.417
- I rest my case.
- Well, then, Leslie,

212
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:04.417
you don't have to write this essay.
Pick something else to write about.

213
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.083
Yeah, like, how to live in a cave.

214
00:17:07.167 --> 00:17:09.292
That's enough, Mr. Hoager.

215
00:17:15.333 --> 00:17:17.083
Hey, Leslie, come here.

216
00:17:17.167 --> 00:17:20.375
What are you gonna write your essay on?
Bats in caves?

217
00:17:34.333 --> 00:17:37.500
- Here comes Janice!
- New kid's in Janice's seat.

218
00:17:37.583 --> 00:17:41.792
- What does she think she's doing?
- Jess! The big kids will kill her!

219
00:17:43.083 --> 00:17:45.833
You have a death wish?
This row's for eighth-graders.

220
00:17:45.917 --> 00:17:50.792
That's right, beanpole. Move it.
Out of my way, farm boy.

221
00:18:09.083 --> 00:18:11.500
You're really asking for it.

222
00:18:11.542 --> 00:18:14.667
Seems to me she gives it out
whether you ask for it or not.

223
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.917
So might as well have some fun.

224
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.708
Getting Janice all wound up
is a weird way of having fun.

225
00:18:22.375 --> 00:18:25.208
Well, what's your idea of having fun?

226
00:18:25.542 --> 00:18:28.125
- I don't know.
- Well, you wanna do something?

227
00:18:28.792 --> 00:18:31.375
- I don't know.
- Let's do something. Definitely.

228
00:18:31.458 --> 00:18:32.750
- What?
- You can't do it.

229
00:18:32.833 --> 00:18:35.625
- Do what?
- What we're doing.

230
00:18:40.667 --> 00:18:44.042
Hey, May Belle!
I don't use my Barbies anymore.

231
00:18:44.125 --> 00:18:47.375
- If you want, you can have them.
- To keep for permanent?

232
00:18:47.458 --> 00:18:49.417
- Sure.
- Thanks.

233
00:18:52.167 --> 00:18:53.833
You're lucky to have a sister.

234
00:18:53.917 --> 00:18:56.792
I've got four, and I'd
trade them all for a good dog.

235
00:18:56.833 --> 00:18:59.208
I'd love to have a dog.

236
00:18:59.292 --> 00:19:01.583
Now let's go before
she changes her mind.

237
00:19:02.208 --> 00:19:05.125
Race you to the end of the road.
On your mark, get set, go!

238
00:19:35.958 --> 00:19:37.875
Come on, Jess!

239
00:19:37.958 --> 00:19:39.083
Come on!

240
00:19:44.125 --> 00:19:46.333
What about sharks?

241
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.708
You ever see any sharks while you're

242
00:19:50.792 --> 00:19:52.958
scuba-ing or whatever?

243
00:19:53.042 --> 00:19:55.708
I've never gone scuba diving
in my whole life.

244
00:19:57.125 --> 00:20:00.625
- You lied in your essay?
- No. I made it up.

245
00:20:00.708 --> 00:20:02.958
It's different from lying.

246
00:20:04.458 --> 00:20:07.667
Those drawings you make,
you seen those things yourself?

247
00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:10.500
No, but...

248
00:20:15.083 --> 00:20:16.625
Hey! Look at that!

249
00:20:17.042 --> 00:20:18.958
- Cool!
- That's been there forever.

250
00:20:19.042 --> 00:20:20.417
I wouldn't trust it.

251
00:20:21.208 --> 00:20:23.042
Come on. Just try it.

252
00:20:25.458 --> 00:20:26.958
OK.

253
00:20:33.542 --> 00:20:35.667
You got it? That's it.

254
00:20:37.292 --> 00:20:38.667
Thanks.

255
00:20:41.458 --> 00:20:44.208
- What are you doing?
- Getting up higher.

256
00:20:46.167 --> 00:20:47.458
OK.

257
00:20:55.708 --> 00:20:58.958
Wow! That was so much fun.
You have to try it. Come on.

258
00:21:20.375 --> 00:21:21.833
OK.

259
00:21:39.458 --> 00:21:41.625
Let your head hang back,
watch the clouds.

260
00:21:41.708 --> 00:21:43.542
Feels like flying.

261
00:22:09.917 --> 00:22:13.958
- We need a place. Just for us.
- Hmm?

262
00:22:14.083 --> 00:22:17.042
Where there's no
Janice Averys or Scott Hoagers.

263
00:22:17.083 --> 00:22:20.917
Yeah, but when we go back to school,
there they are waiting.

264
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.667
Yeah, but...

265
00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:25.917
...someplace better than
just not being at school.

266
00:22:26.625 --> 00:22:29.542
What if there was a magical kingdom
only we knew about?

267
00:22:30.708 --> 00:22:32.375
I don't know. What if?

268
00:22:32.458 --> 00:22:34.708
OK, well...

269
00:22:34.792 --> 00:22:37.458
...what if the only way
we could enter it

270
00:22:37.542 --> 00:22:39.875
is by swinging on this enchanted rope?

271
00:22:39.958 --> 00:22:42.917
- Enchanted rope?
- Yeah.

272
00:22:43.833 --> 00:22:45.458
Come on.

273
00:22:50.667 --> 00:22:52.708
Leslie!

274
00:22:54.083 --> 00:22:55.125
Leslie!

275
00:23:06.042 --> 00:23:07.833
Leslie.

276
00:23:13.042 --> 00:23:15.375
- Come on!
- Wait up.

277
00:23:44.958 --> 00:23:46.500
Ahh!

278
00:23:46.583 --> 00:23:49.125
We shouldn't be in here.
This isn't our land.

279
00:23:49.208 --> 00:23:52.250
- Not so loud. They'll hear you.
- What are you talking about?

280
00:23:59.083 --> 00:24:01.292
Hey! What's that?

281
00:24:03.417 --> 00:24:06.917
Whoa. Jess, look at this. Wow.

282
00:24:09.417 --> 00:24:12.875
Too bad for them.
They got so close.

283
00:24:12.917 --> 00:24:16.083
- What are you talking about?
- To the kingdom.

284
00:24:18.417 --> 00:24:21.042
- What's that?
- What?

285
00:24:21.083 --> 00:24:24.292
That sound. I've heard it before.
Someone's out there.

286
00:24:24.375 --> 00:24:27.333
That's the sound of the prisoners
rattling their chains.

287
00:24:28.167 --> 00:24:30.042
What prisoners?

288
00:24:30.125 --> 00:24:32.583
The prisoners of the Dark Master.

289
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.417
- We should go.
- Wait, Jess, look.

290
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:42.375
What is it?

291
00:24:46.583 --> 00:24:48.083
Look at this.

292
00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.167
Wow. This is amazing.

293
00:25:02.542 --> 00:25:03.708
Wow.

294
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:16.500
This is it.

295
00:25:32.708 --> 00:25:34.375
Warriors.

296
00:25:36.083 --> 00:25:39.917
- Try dragonflies.
- No. They're warriors.

297
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.375
From the treetop provinces.

298
00:25:43.542 --> 00:25:47.750
- I don't know this game.
- What game? This is for real.

299
00:25:50.125 --> 00:25:53.958
This is the ruins
of a once great fortress

300
00:25:54.042 --> 00:25:56.542
whose people have been imprisoned.

301
00:25:58.625 --> 00:26:01.583
Jess, you and I have been
sent to free them.

302
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:07.083
Prisoners of the Dark Master, hear me!

303
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:10.500
We have come to free you.

304
00:26:10.583 --> 00:26:12.208
Do you hear us?

305
00:26:12.292 --> 00:26:14.250
Show me that you hear us!

306
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:25.708
You got lucky timing. The wind's
been blowing off and on all day.

307
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:32.250
Can't hear you!

308
00:27:06.917 --> 00:27:10.000
- Go straight home. I'll see you soon.
- OK. See ya!

309
00:28:35.167 --> 00:28:37.917
Hey, don't you think
we should give her a hand?

310
00:28:41.125 --> 00:28:42.750
Uh... She's... She's fine.

311
00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:45.750
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

312
00:28:45.792 --> 00:28:47.458
...forget. There are four of us.

313
00:28:47.542 --> 00:28:48.875
OK.

314
00:28:50.792 --> 00:28:52.792
Remember to bring your bag.

315
00:28:52.875 --> 00:28:55.333
Why would anyone
want to wear that?

316
00:29:00.958 --> 00:29:02.417
Janice!

317
00:29:02.458 --> 00:29:04.083
- You OK?
- What's the problem?

318
00:29:04.167 --> 00:29:06.917
- Jess Aarons tripped me.
- Uh...

319
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.083
On purpose.

320
00:29:09.125 --> 00:29:11.750
OK, Aarons. Hit the road.

321
00:29:12.875 --> 00:29:15.167
- But he didn't do anything.
- Go.

322
00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:18.958
- It was definitely him.
- I know.

323
00:29:34.333 --> 00:29:38.500
- What happened to you?
- Janice is a very talented person.

324
00:29:38.583 --> 00:29:41.417
She can shoot ketchup packets
over four rows of seats.

325
00:29:41.458 --> 00:29:43.250
Jeez.

326
00:29:43.625 --> 00:29:46.750
Can I wash up at your house?
My mom sees this, she'll be all over

327
00:29:46.792 --> 00:29:49.417
the principal and everybody,
and my life will be over.

328
00:29:52.458 --> 00:29:55.542
<i>Why would Dad do this?</i>

329
00:29:55.625 --> 00:29:57.542
- Oh. Hello.
- Oh.

330
00:29:57.625 --> 00:30:00.042
Mom, this is Leslie.

331
00:30:00.125 --> 00:30:01.958
- Hi, Leslie.
- Hi.

332
00:30:02.042 --> 00:30:04.750
- It's nice to meet you.
- Thank you. You too.

333
00:30:05.875 --> 00:30:08.458
So are you and your family
getting settled in OK?

334
00:30:08.542 --> 00:30:11.958
- Yes, ma'am.
- That's nice.

335
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.625
- Come on. See ya later.
- Not too late, OK, honey?

336
00:30:15.458 --> 00:30:20.417
- Weird and weirder.
- Hey. Be glad he's found a friend.

337
00:30:20.458 --> 00:30:24.208
- Where's your dad work?
- At home. Same as my mom.

338
00:30:24.292 --> 00:30:26.375
- They're writers.
- Writers?

339
00:30:26.458 --> 00:30:29.542
- What do they write about?
- Fiction.

340
00:30:29.625 --> 00:30:31.250
That explains you.

341
00:30:32.708 --> 00:30:36.125
- What do you mean?
- Well, you like to make things up.

342
00:30:36.208 --> 00:30:38.708
And that's what your parents
do for a living.

343
00:30:40.083 --> 00:30:42.708
You know a lot about hardware?

344
00:30:42.792 --> 00:30:44.708
No. Why?

345
00:30:44.792 --> 00:30:48.333
Well, your dad works
at a hardware store.

346
00:30:48.417 --> 00:30:50.083
OK.

347
00:30:50.583 --> 00:30:53.292
All I'm saying is that
you are who you are...

348
00:30:53.333 --> 00:30:55.000
...not your parents.

349
00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:01.083
If they work at your house, you must
get to hang out with them a lot.

350
00:31:03.833 --> 00:31:05.625
Not really.

351
00:31:08.083 --> 00:31:09.833
What's that?

352
00:31:09.917 --> 00:31:12.792
- Grenade.
- There're no grenades here.

353
00:31:16.167 --> 00:31:17.333
Come on!

354
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.417
- Squirrels!
- Part squirrel, part Scott Hoager.

355
00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.500
- Squogre.
- Squogre!

356
00:31:27.875 --> 00:31:30.417
The sneaky foot soldiers
of the Dark Master.

357
00:31:31.542 --> 00:31:33.792
- They're attacking!
- We need ammo!

358
00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.542
This is not good.

359
00:31:45.458 --> 00:31:48.917
- See them? Up there?
- Yeah.

360
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.042
- Do you? Really?
- Yeah.

361
00:32:03.708 --> 00:32:04.958
Les...

362
00:32:06.167 --> 00:32:07.292
Leslie?

363
00:32:09.042 --> 00:32:12.333
Leslie. Leslie!

364
00:32:14.042 --> 00:32:16.625
Come on. You can see
the whole kingdom from up here.

365
00:32:20.167 --> 00:32:23.208
Isn't this cool?
We can do anything here.

366
00:32:32.917 --> 00:32:34.833
Look at it.

367
00:32:34.875 --> 00:32:37.625
It's all ours.

368
00:32:37.667 --> 00:32:41.167
From the mountains to the oceans.

369
00:32:44.083 --> 00:32:46.750
- What am I looking for exactly?
- You'll see.

370
00:32:46.833 --> 00:32:49.792
Just close your eyes...

371
00:32:49.833 --> 00:32:51.625
...but keep your mind wide open.

372
00:33:06.333 --> 00:33:07.542
Wow.

373
00:33:09.292 --> 00:33:11.333
What do we call this place?

374
00:33:14.375 --> 00:33:15.958
Terabithia.

375
00:33:22.667 --> 00:33:27.125
Shh.
Everybody tiptoe. OK, ready?

376
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.375
Happy birthday!

377
00:33:30.458 --> 00:33:37.375
<i># Happy birthday to you</i>

378
00:33:37.458 --> 00:33:41.292
<i># Happy birthday, dear Jess</i>

379
00:33:41.333 --> 00:33:44.292
<i># Happy birthday to you #</i>

380
00:33:44.667 --> 00:33:45.958
Make a wish.

381
00:33:46.792 --> 00:33:48.792
- Yay!
- What'd you wish for?

382
00:33:54.875 --> 00:33:58.333
- This is cheap junk.
- No, it isn't.

383
00:33:58.417 --> 00:34:01.208
- I love it.
- How? It doesn't even work.

384
00:34:01.292 --> 00:34:04.042
I don't think we have
the hang of it yet, Dad.

385
00:34:04.125 --> 00:34:07.167
You know what? Keep the box.
We'll see if we can take it back.

386
00:34:09.167 --> 00:34:11.667
Daddy, there's something
in the greenhouse.

387
00:34:17.542 --> 00:34:20.917
That's the last thing I need,
some animal chewing it's way in here.

388
00:34:21.917 --> 00:34:24.292
What are you going to do
if you catch it?

389
00:34:24.333 --> 00:34:26.667
These vegetables are our livelihood.

390
00:34:26.708 --> 00:34:29.917
Can't afford to share them
with animals that get in here.

391
00:34:30.833 --> 00:34:32.792
- So, you're gonna kill it?
- Have to.

392
00:34:35.375 --> 00:34:39.625
Well, he's not gonna
get in here now, right, Dad?

393
00:34:39.667 --> 00:34:43.375
Hope not. But if he does,
you just let me deal with it.

394
00:34:44.833 --> 00:34:47.083
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

395
00:34:47.167 --> 00:34:50.875
No, why don't you go on and do
your homework, I'll clean this mess up.

396
00:35:02.708 --> 00:35:04.667
Under the seat.

397
00:35:09.625 --> 00:35:11.792
I heard it was
your birthday yesterday.

398
00:35:16.042 --> 00:35:18.958
- Like it?
- Wow.

399
00:35:19.792 --> 00:35:22.292
It must've cost a fortune.

400
00:35:22.833 --> 00:35:25.000
What's it matter what it costs?

401
00:35:25.958 --> 00:35:27.208
I don't know.

402
00:35:27.292 --> 00:35:30.708
Well, I can take it back
and get a cheaper one, if you want.

403
00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:35.458
Thanks... a lot.

404
00:35:36.375 --> 00:35:39.292
<i># Jess and Leslie sitting in a tree...</i>

405
00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.500
Look.
The squogre and the vulture.

406
00:35:52.583 --> 00:35:54.292
Hey, here he comes.

407
00:35:54.375 --> 00:35:57.875
And a guy who can stand up to a squogre
is scared of a Hoager?

408
00:36:00.917 --> 00:36:03.000
Ms. Edmunds?

409
00:36:03.083 --> 00:36:05.958
- He speaks.
- Can I help you with those?

410
00:36:06.042 --> 00:36:09.417
You sure can.
And you just made my day.

411
00:36:12.042 --> 00:36:13.458
- Great.
- I'll get that one.

412
00:36:13.542 --> 00:36:14.833
Thank you.

413
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.042
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hi, boys.

414
00:36:32.208 --> 00:36:34.583
How come you're so good at that?

415
00:36:34.667 --> 00:36:36.833
- Good at what?
- Building stuff.

416
00:36:36.875 --> 00:36:38.417
You're good at it for a girl.

417
00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:41.375
Same way I'm fast... for a girl.

418
00:36:41.458 --> 00:36:44.000
You know what I mean.

419
00:36:44.042 --> 00:36:47.167
You're pretty good at art... for a boy.

420
00:36:47.208 --> 00:36:49.125
OK, OK, truce.

421
00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:55.708
Don't your parents notice
this stuff's missing?

422
00:36:55.833 --> 00:36:58.208
Not when they're in
the middle of writing a book.

423
00:36:58.292 --> 00:37:00.833
What's that?

424
00:37:02.042 --> 00:37:03.208
Show yourselves!

425
00:37:16.833 --> 00:37:19.208
It's a giant troll!

426
00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:21.500
No, it's a giant tree
that almost killed us!

427
00:37:21.542 --> 00:37:24.042
You think that tree
just fell all by itself?

428
00:37:25.292 --> 00:37:26.375
Come on.

429
00:37:26.458 --> 00:37:29.875
When the Dark Master saw
the squogres weren't scaring us away,

430
00:37:29.958 --> 00:37:33.458
- he sent a giant troll.
- How big?

431
00:37:37.958 --> 00:37:39.958
That's how big its feet are.

432
00:37:43.208 --> 00:37:46.375
- You really think so?
- What else could it be?

433
00:37:48.167 --> 00:37:50.000
What should we do?

434
00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:59.333
If we had a troll hunter, we could
track its scent and sneak up on it.

435
00:38:00.125 --> 00:38:02.125
Hey, look at that! Come on!

436
00:38:04.875 --> 00:38:06.375
I think it went that way!

437
00:38:07.333 --> 00:38:10.583
We rule Terabithia,
and nothing crushes us!

438
00:38:15.375 --> 00:38:16.958
I'll race you to the rope.

439
00:38:23.083 --> 00:38:25.542
I love this place!

440
00:38:43.375 --> 00:38:46.125
Go on, get out of here.
And don't come back.

441
00:38:59.917 --> 00:39:01.875
What do you think you're doing?

442
00:39:01.958 --> 00:39:05.917
- I took care of it for you.
- Did you, now? Now, how'd you do that?

443
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.875
I took him into the forest.
He's not coming back, promise.

444
00:39:08.958 --> 00:39:12.333
Did he tell you he's gonna
stay the hell out of the greenhouse?

445
00:39:12.417 --> 00:39:14.875
No, he went out there
and he's not coming...

446
00:39:14.958 --> 00:39:17.208
Jess, you need to understand
something, OK?

447
00:39:17.292 --> 00:39:21.167
This is not one of your cartoons. This
is just a pest that eats up our food,

448
00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:23.375
money we earn and time we don't have.

449
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:26.667
- OK.
- Get your head out of the clouds

450
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:27.917
and do as I say.

451
00:39:28.917 --> 00:39:30.708
OK.

452
00:40:00.875 --> 00:40:02.792
Good night, sweetheart.

453
00:40:04.542 --> 00:40:06.125
Sweet dreams.

454
00:40:07.208 --> 00:40:10.583
Lights out, Jess.

455
00:40:10.667 --> 00:40:12.292
Night, Dad.

456
00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:21.250
Are we slaying the giant troll
after school today?

457
00:40:21.333 --> 00:40:24.083
You've got your head
in the clouds, Leslie.

458
00:40:24.167 --> 00:40:27.708
- Huh?
- There is no giant troll, all right?

459
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:31.583
Well, you better not let
the Terabithians hear you.

460
00:40:31.625 --> 00:40:33.542
They thought you were their king.

461
00:40:47.792 --> 00:40:51.417
Alexandra, my daddy gave me Twinkies!

462
00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:54.750
Neither one squished, 'cause I
didn't put them next to my drink.

463
00:40:54.792 --> 00:40:56.625
I'd shut up about those Twinkies.

464
00:40:56.708 --> 00:40:59.458
You're just mad 'cause I
got some and you didn't.

465
00:40:59.542 --> 00:41:01.792
Whatever. Don't cry to me
when you lose them.

466
00:41:01.875 --> 00:41:03.417
I'll eat them, not lose them.

467
00:41:09.125 --> 00:41:11.958
Jess! Jess!

468
00:41:12.042 --> 00:41:16.083
Janice Avery stole my Twinkies!
Janice Avery stole my Twinkies!

469
00:41:16.167 --> 00:41:20.000
- I told you, keep your mouth shut.
- She's there. What are you gonna do?

470
00:41:20.083 --> 00:41:22.250
And she makes you pay to pee!

471
00:41:23.667 --> 00:41:25.375
It's a dollar, shorty.

472
00:41:25.417 --> 00:41:29.125
But I don't have a dollar.

473
00:41:29.208 --> 00:41:32.750
That's not fair, is it?
Peeing's definitely supposed to be free.

474
00:41:32.833 --> 00:41:34.208
Free to pee!

475
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:37.458
Free to pee! Free to pee! Free to pee!

476
00:41:40.417 --> 00:41:41.500
Let's go.

477
00:41:53.917 --> 00:41:56.250
I want my Twinkies, Janice Avery.

478
00:41:56.333 --> 00:41:58.250
What Twinkies, Twinkie?

479
00:41:59.583 --> 00:42:02.875
You're supposed to beat her up.
You're my brother!

480
00:42:02.917 --> 00:42:06.042
Do you know what would happen
if I were to pick a fight with her?

481
00:42:06.125 --> 00:42:08.333
You'll get your butt kicked.

482
00:42:08.417 --> 00:42:12.375
No, I'd get kicked out of school for
fighting a girl. What's that prove?

483
00:42:12.458 --> 00:42:15.167
She stole my Twinkies.

484
00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:18.500
Come on.

485
00:42:20.375 --> 00:42:22.208
It's all right, May Belle.

486
00:42:22.292 --> 00:42:26.125
We'll get her back. Won't we, Jess?

487
00:42:30.667 --> 00:42:33.458
<i>Don't let
the Terabithians hear you.</i>

488
00:42:33.542 --> 00:42:35.458
<i>They thought you were their king.</i>

489
00:42:55.625 --> 00:42:57.708
Jess! Jess!

490
00:43:08.167 --> 00:43:11.750
Oh... Hi! Look at you!

491
00:43:11.792 --> 00:43:16.583
That is your very own, certified,
purebred, giant troll hunter.

492
00:43:17.167 --> 00:43:18.625
- He's for me?
- Yeah,

493
00:43:18.667 --> 00:43:21.083
he just took a giant
pee all over my sweatshirt.

494
00:43:21.125 --> 00:43:23.625
Wow, Jess. Thank you.

495
00:43:28.083 --> 00:43:30.167
I name you Prince Terrien,

496
00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:33.125
giant troll hunter extraordinaire.

497
00:43:33.208 --> 00:43:35.167
P.T. For short.

498
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:40.958
Hey! I think he smells a troll.
Come on.

499
00:43:44.417 --> 00:43:47.083
Oh, no! We've got company!

500
00:43:47.125 --> 00:43:49.333
Dead meat! Dead meat!

501
00:43:50.667 --> 00:43:53.250
- Dead meat! Dead meat!
- Hairy Vultures!

502
00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:56.917
What's that?

503
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.750
It's a giant troll.

504
00:44:08.958 --> 00:44:10.333
Nice feet.

505
00:44:13.042 --> 00:44:14.375
Run!

506
00:44:17.333 --> 00:44:18.792
Oh, my gosh!

507
00:44:25.458 --> 00:44:27.583
I think we lost it.

508
00:44:29.625 --> 00:44:34.250
Leslie...

509
00:44:34.333 --> 00:44:36.917
- What's its weak spot?
- Does it have a weak spot?

510
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.458
I don't know!

511
00:44:40.125 --> 00:44:43.292
Just making it madder!

512
00:44:43.917 --> 00:44:45.625
P.T.!

513
00:44:48.417 --> 00:44:51.000
That's it! That's its weak spot!

514
00:44:51.083 --> 00:44:53.000
It's ticklish!

515
00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:57.250
- Gross!
- Troll toe jam.

516
00:44:58.208 --> 00:45:00.417
Good boy, P.T. Good boy!

517
00:45:00.958 --> 00:45:02.583
Good dog.

518
00:45:08.458 --> 00:45:10.708
What's Janice's weak spot, you think?

519
00:45:12.583 --> 00:45:14.958
Eighth-grade girl...

520
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.792
...probably eighth-grade boys.

521
00:45:16.875 --> 00:45:18.917
Who's she got a crush on?

522
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.625
I don't know. Let's see...

523
00:45:21.708 --> 00:45:25.250
...coolest boy in
eighth grade is probably...

524
00:45:25.292 --> 00:45:26.875
...Willard Hughes.

525
00:45:26.958 --> 00:45:29.417
- That's it.
- What's it?

526
00:45:30.875 --> 00:45:33.750
Write, "Dear Janice... "

527
00:45:33.792 --> 00:45:36.458
- You do it.
- No way.

528
00:45:36.542 --> 00:45:39.083
Boys' handwriting sucks.
No offense.

529
00:45:39.125 --> 00:45:40.333
It's gotta be you.

530
00:45:42.792 --> 00:45:44.458
OK.

531
00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:46.458
"Dear Janice,

532
00:45:46.542 --> 00:45:50.083
<i>you're the most amazing and
beautiful person I've ever known. "</i>

533
00:45:50.167 --> 00:45:53.958
- How do I know which desk is hers?
- It's got dried-up blood and old bones.

534
00:45:58.375 --> 00:46:01.792
<i>"I do not know if you know this
about me, but I need to tell you,</i>

535
00:46:01.875 --> 00:46:05.292
<i>I think you are so cool.</i>

536
00:46:05.333 --> 00:46:09.208
You are the coolest over
all the other girls in our school. "

537
00:46:09.292 --> 00:46:10.792
OK. Write this,

538
00:46:10.875 --> 00:46:14.500
<i>"Let's find out if what
I think we have is real. "</i>

539
00:46:18.375 --> 00:46:20.625
- Oh, Mr. Bailey...
- Huh?

540
00:46:20.667 --> 00:46:24.125
...I was looking for you.
- Me? Why?

541
00:46:24.208 --> 00:46:27.458
I think someone threw up
in the girls' room.

542
00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:29.708
All right, I'll take a look.

543
00:46:35.625 --> 00:46:38.500
"Meet me by the bus
after school today.

544
00:46:38.583 --> 00:46:41.833
We can ride home together
and talk about us. "

545
00:46:43.625 --> 00:46:46.292
<i>Underline and capitalize the "us. "</i>

546
00:46:46.333 --> 00:46:48.500
"All my love, Willard. "

547
00:46:51.708 --> 00:46:54.833
You know, if we get caught,
they're both gonna kill us.

548
00:47:04.667 --> 00:47:07.417
- I got your note.
- What are you talking about?

549
00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:09.083
That was really sweet.

550
00:47:09.167 --> 00:47:11.458
- I'm saving these seats.
- For who?

551
00:47:11.542 --> 00:47:14.292
Willard Hughes is gonna
ride Janice home today.

552
00:47:14.375 --> 00:47:17.125
- What are you talking about?
- Willard and Janice.

553
00:47:17.208 --> 00:47:19.417
They're totally in love.

554
00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:22.750
In your dreams.
Well, you better tell Willard that.

555
00:47:22.833 --> 00:47:25.167
It looks like he's
heading home in his own bus.

556
00:47:34.667 --> 00:47:36.542
Look at Janice!

557
00:47:40.375 --> 00:47:43.125
Hey, Janice, what happened?

558
00:47:43.167 --> 00:47:45.458
Didn't Willard know
he's in love with you?

559
00:47:48.167 --> 00:47:50.792
Where's
your boyfriend, Janice?

560
00:47:58.875 --> 00:48:02.417
- What just happened?
- He just walked away.

561
00:48:09.208 --> 00:48:11.292
- Yes.
- You wanna go?

562
00:48:11.375 --> 00:48:13.333
- Yeah.
- I wanna come.

563
00:48:13.375 --> 00:48:16.958
- You can't.
- It's a free country!

564
00:48:17.042 --> 00:48:20.333
Don't follow us, or I'll tell Alexandra
you still suck your thumb

565
00:48:20.417 --> 00:48:22.333
and sleep with Mr. Blanky.

566
00:48:24.875 --> 00:48:28.833
- So, what do you say?
- They must have finished their book.

567
00:48:28.875 --> 00:48:31.167
- How do you know?
- Hey, Leslie.

568
00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:33.833
- We need your help.
- Come on.

569
00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:41.417
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, Leslie, come on.

570
00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:43.667
All right, let's go.
We're on a mission.

571
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:46.083
Hey, this is my friend, Jess.
Can he help?

572
00:48:46.167 --> 00:48:49.125
So, you're the infamous Jess.
Hi, I'm Judy.

573
00:48:49.208 --> 00:48:51.958
Leslie tells me you're good
with a paint brush.

574
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.667
Grab one and get going.

575
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:56.667
Come on! I am determined
to have this wall finished

576
00:48:56.750 --> 00:49:00.292
so when the late sun hits it,
we can watch it catch fire.

577
00:49:04.542 --> 00:49:08.750
Now, that's one steady hand, Jess.
That's an artist's hand. Am I right?

578
00:49:10.167 --> 00:49:11.708
Yeah.

579
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.333
You know,
the best prize that life offers,

580
00:49:14.375 --> 00:49:17.167
is the chance to work hard
at work worth doing.

581
00:49:17.208 --> 00:49:19.292
Teddy Roosevelt said that, not me.

582
00:49:57.042 --> 00:50:01.000
- Wow.
- What did I tell you? Was it worth it?

583
00:50:29.167 --> 00:50:30.667
Hey, guys.

584
00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:33.250
Jess, get started on your homework, OK?

585
00:50:33.333 --> 00:50:35.958
I'm managing the store
on weekends, starting soon,

586
00:50:36.042 --> 00:50:38.792
I need you to pick up
on some chores around here.

587
00:50:38.875 --> 00:50:41.458
You know, the best prize
that life can offer

588
00:50:41.542 --> 00:50:44.375
is working hard at work worth doing.

589
00:50:59.167 --> 00:51:00.417
Hey...

590
00:51:02.625 --> 00:51:05.042
...have you taken art classes?

591
00:51:05.125 --> 00:51:08.542
No, I...
I just made them up myself.

592
00:51:08.583 --> 00:51:10.375
You're really talented.

593
00:51:13.708 --> 00:51:17.042
Jess, don't let those other kids
get in your way.

594
00:51:19.375 --> 00:51:22.625
- Oh, here you go.
- Thank you.

595
00:51:27.042 --> 00:51:28.958
I just went to use the girl's room.

596
00:51:29.042 --> 00:51:31.333
Someone's in a stall,
crying their eyes out,

597
00:51:31.375 --> 00:51:33.542
and I think it's Janice Avery.

598
00:51:33.625 --> 00:51:35.583
It can't be the trick we played, can it?

599
00:51:35.667 --> 00:51:37.500
No way. But come here.

600
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:43.583
Free to pee!

601
00:51:43.833 --> 00:51:45.833
Get out of here!

602
00:51:45.875 --> 00:51:49.333
Get out of here, now!

603
00:51:51.250 --> 00:51:54.208
- You should go talk to her.
- You kidding?

604
00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:57.625
It's not "skinned knee crying,"
it's something serious.

605
00:51:57.708 --> 00:52:00.042
It's the girls' bathroom,
I can't go in there.

606
00:52:00.125 --> 00:52:03.167
- I don't wanna go in there alone.
- What's the matter?

607
00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:07.208
A girl who can stand up to a giant troll
is afraid of some dumb eighth grader?

608
00:52:40.542 --> 00:52:41.792
Sorry.

609
00:52:41.875 --> 00:52:45.167
- Go on, tell me.
- No, I don't wanna tell you.

610
00:52:45.208 --> 00:52:47.750
- Why not?
- I'll tell you there.

611
00:52:51.667 --> 00:52:55.625
He, like, came up to me.
I'm pretty sure he likes me.

612
00:53:03.125 --> 00:53:05.750
No way! I like Tony!

613
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:12.333
Her dad gets really mad at her.

614
00:53:12.375 --> 00:53:16.208
So? My dad gets mad at me...
pretty much all the time.

615
00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:18.542
- He hits her.
- Oh.

616
00:53:18.583 --> 00:53:22.583
Some neighbor heard them
yelling so loud, they called the police.

617
00:53:22.667 --> 00:53:26.792
And it got out. And all the seventh
and the eighth graders know about it.

618
00:53:26.875 --> 00:53:32.042
- Whoa.
- Which explains, like, a lot.

619
00:53:34.042 --> 00:53:37.333
Well, what did you say to her?

620
00:53:37.417 --> 00:53:40.917
Well, I told her about not having a TV

621
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.875
and everyone laughing at me.

622
00:53:42.958 --> 00:53:45.958
I know what it's like
to have everyone think I was weird.

623
00:53:46.042 --> 00:53:48.000
Then what'd she say?

624
00:53:48.083 --> 00:53:50.250
She asked me for advice.

625
00:53:51.417 --> 00:53:53.333
Janice Avery asked you for advice?

626
00:53:53.417 --> 00:53:55.792
- Yeah.
- And?

627
00:53:55.875 --> 00:53:58.250
Well, I told her just to pretend

628
00:53:58.333 --> 00:54:01.458
that she had no idea
what anyone was talking about,

629
00:54:01.542 --> 00:54:06.333
and in a few weeks' time,
everybody would just forget about it.

630
00:54:06.417 --> 00:54:08.292
Man...

631
00:54:08.375 --> 00:54:10.000
Then I gave her a piece of gum.

632
00:54:11.375 --> 00:54:13.417
- We should go.
- Yeah.

633
00:54:14.417 --> 00:54:17.542
- Wanna come back tomorrow?
- Can't. I got chores.

634
00:54:17.625 --> 00:54:20.500
- How about the next day?
- Sunday we go to church.

635
00:54:20.583 --> 00:54:22.625
- Can I come?
- You'd hate it.

636
00:54:22.708 --> 00:54:26.208
- No, I think it'd be cool.
- Uh, girls can't wear pants.

637
00:54:26.292 --> 00:54:30.667
- I've got dresses, Jess.
- You in a dress? That'd be a sight!

638
00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:32.375
See ya!

639
00:55:23.625 --> 00:55:26.708
That's what we need.
Bells... in Terabithia.

640
00:55:31.708 --> 00:55:33.667
I'm really glad I came.

641
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:36.625
That whole Jesus thing,
it's really interesting.

642
00:55:36.708 --> 00:55:39.083
It's not interesting.
It's scary!

643
00:55:39.125 --> 00:55:41.542
It's nailing holes through your hands.

644
00:55:41.583 --> 00:55:45.292
It's 'cause we're all vile sinners.
God made Jesus die.

645
00:55:45.375 --> 00:55:48.250
- You really think that's true?
- It's in the Bible.

646
00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:50.875
You have to believe it,
and you hate it.

647
00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:54.667
I don't have to believe it,
and I think it's beautiful.

648
00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:57.583
- You gotta believe the Bible, Leslie.
- Why?

649
00:55:57.625 --> 00:56:00.375
'Cause if you
don't believe in the Bible,

650
00:56:00.417 --> 00:56:02.583
God will damn you to hell when you die.

651
00:56:02.667 --> 00:56:04.875
Wow, May Belle.
Where'd you hear that?

652
00:56:04.917 --> 00:56:06.750
That's right, huh, Jess?

653
00:56:06.792 --> 00:56:11.000
God damns you to hell
if you don't believe in the Bible.

654
00:56:11.083 --> 00:56:13.542
- I think so.
- Well, I don't think so.

655
00:56:13.583 --> 00:56:17.417
I seriously do not think God
goes around damning people to hell.

656
00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:20.167
He's too busy running all this.

657
00:56:26.167 --> 00:56:29.083
Hey, Jess.
Give me a hand.

658
00:56:30.375 --> 00:56:32.292
Yeah. I'm coming.

659
00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:36.500
Get my drill out of the greenhouse.

660
00:56:55.083 --> 00:56:57.042
You haven't managed
to kill those yet?

661
00:56:57.125 --> 00:56:58.875
Not funny.

662
00:56:58.917 --> 00:57:00.125
Look.

663
00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:02.917
Ever thought of
putting them in the sun?

664
00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:19.958
Jess. Jess.

665
00:57:20.042 --> 00:57:23.292
- Where are my keys?
- What?

666
00:57:23.375 --> 00:57:26.292
My keys. You never gave them back to me.

667
00:57:34.208 --> 00:57:36.125
- Think!
- I put the drill down here.

668
00:57:36.208 --> 00:57:39.417
Damn it, the keys to the store
are on it, the register, all of it.

669
00:57:39.458 --> 00:57:42.500
They have to replace those locks,
$ 700 out of my paycheck.

670
00:57:42.583 --> 00:57:44.125
They gotta be right here.

671
00:57:44.208 --> 00:57:47.458
- If I don't have those keys...
- I'll find them, Dad. I promise.

672
00:57:47.542 --> 00:57:50.750
Why don't you draw me some money
to pay for it? How about that?

673
00:57:50.833 --> 00:57:53.042
Make yourself useful,
draw me some money.

674
00:57:53.125 --> 00:57:54.542
I said I'll find them.

675
00:57:59.292 --> 00:58:02.917
You look awful.
What's the matter?

676
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.917
I lost the keys where my dad works,

677
00:58:04.958 --> 00:58:07.750
and now he has to get
new keys made, and locks.

678
00:58:07.833 --> 00:58:09.458
May Belle?

679
00:58:09.542 --> 00:58:11.958
Please don't anyone get mad at me.

680
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.375
- What?
- He...

681
00:58:14.458 --> 00:58:17.667
- I know where your dad's keys are.
- You do?

682
00:58:18.333 --> 00:58:21.083
You know the bells
we talked about making?

683
00:58:21.167 --> 00:58:24.500
Well, it was meant to be a surprise.

684
00:58:24.583 --> 00:58:26.500
All that clanking metal and junk.

685
00:58:26.583 --> 00:58:29.250
And... May Belle wanted to help.

686
00:58:29.292 --> 00:58:30.833
And you let her?

687
00:58:32.375 --> 00:58:34.833
Why did you tell me
you found them on the ground?

688
00:58:34.917 --> 00:58:37.458
- They were.
- On the ground in the greenhouse.

689
00:58:37.542 --> 00:58:40.000
What's the matter with you?
Dad wants to kill me.

690
00:58:40.083 --> 00:58:42.667
I was waiting for the right time.

691
00:58:45.167 --> 00:58:47.125
So you know where the keys are?

692
00:58:57.708 --> 00:58:59.000
See ya later.

693
00:59:01.667 --> 00:59:04.917
- Tell Mom I'll be home in a bit.
- Are you gonna tell Dad it was me?

694
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.375
Don't worry. It's my job
to get Dad's keys back. See you later.

695
00:59:16.125 --> 00:59:17.667
Whoa.

696
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:20.917
Look how high it got.
Come on. Let's go.

697
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:28.958
"Get your head out of the clouds, boy.
Draw me some money.

698
00:59:29.042 --> 00:59:32.583
- Make yourself useful, draw me money. "
- What are you going on about?

699
00:59:32.667 --> 00:59:35.750
"This isn't one of your cartoons.
This is serious. "

700
00:59:35.792 --> 00:59:40.125
What's so great about being serious
all the time anyway? Tell me that.

701
00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:48.000
What if the Dark Master
gets the keys first?

702
00:59:48.083 --> 00:59:51.292
I'm not scared of any Dark Master,
and those are my dad's keys.

703
01:00:04.708 --> 01:00:07.208
Leslie, get behind me.

704
01:00:09.583 --> 01:00:11.667
Jess, turn around. There's more.

705
01:00:12.958 --> 01:00:14.375
Here, take this.

706
01:00:17.958 --> 01:00:19.958
Jess!

707
01:00:30.083 --> 01:00:31.292
P.T., get him!

708
01:00:39.042 --> 01:00:41.083
Good boy, P.T.

709
01:00:53.958 --> 01:00:55.000
Yeah!

710
01:00:55.083 --> 01:00:58.375
- Dead meat! Dead meat! Dead meat!
- Whoa!

711
01:01:01.292 --> 01:01:02.333
Run!

712
01:01:03.167 --> 01:01:05.000
Come on! Faster!

713
01:01:05.083 --> 01:01:07.958
Dead meat! Dead meat!

714
01:01:10.167 --> 01:01:11.458
Dead meat! Dead meat!

715
01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:18.833
Told you they were grenades.

716
01:01:27.167 --> 01:01:28.292
Jess!

717
01:01:28.375 --> 01:01:30.125
I got you, Leslie!

718
01:01:31.042 --> 01:01:32.208
I got you!

719
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:35.667
Up ahead! Get ready!

720
01:01:40.792 --> 01:01:44.625
- They'll catch us.
- We're the fastest in Terabithia.

721
01:01:54.542 --> 01:01:56.208
He's watching us.

722
01:01:59.833 --> 01:02:01.625
Where are the keys?

723
01:02:01.667 --> 01:02:03.917
Here, open this.

724
01:02:16.583 --> 01:02:19.208
Where are Terabithian warriors
when you need them?

725
01:02:19.292 --> 01:02:21.125
I don't know.

726
01:02:24.792 --> 01:02:26.875
Great. Now there's three of us.

727
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:36.375
- Wow.
- Now we're even.

728
01:02:36.458 --> 01:02:37.875
Attack!

729
01:02:47.083 --> 01:02:51.292
Dead meat! Dead meat!
Dead meat! Dead meat! Dead meat!

730
01:02:52.833 --> 01:02:53.792
Come on.

731
01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:57.917
- Come on, P.T.
- Dead meat!

732
01:03:20.583 --> 01:03:23.125
Be careful!
You're almost there.

733
01:03:30.333 --> 01:03:32.667
Jess!

734
01:03:33.208 --> 01:03:34.458
Jess!

735
01:03:52.792 --> 01:03:53.917
Hey.

736
01:04:43.875 --> 01:04:45.958
- See ya!
- Yeah, see ya.

737
01:05:36.542 --> 01:05:39.042
Jess! I called you three times.

738
01:05:39.125 --> 01:05:40.333
It's your girlfriend.

739
01:05:40.417 --> 01:05:42.500
She's not my girlfriend.

740
01:05:43.583 --> 01:05:45.708
<i>- Hey.
- Hello, Jess.</i>

741
01:05:45.792 --> 01:05:47.792
Wait. Who is this?

742
01:05:47.875 --> 01:05:50.500
It's Saturday, but it's
your teacher, Ms. Edmunds.

743
01:05:50.583 --> 01:05:55.000
I was planning on taking my nephews
into the city to the museum,

744
01:05:55.042 --> 01:05:58.958
and my sister changed her plans
last minute, so I had a thought.

745
01:06:03.417 --> 01:06:06.208
- Hey, Mom.
- Hmm? Is it the baby?

746
01:06:06.292 --> 01:06:09.000
No, she's fine.
May Belle's got her.

747
01:06:09.083 --> 01:06:12.625
Teacher wants me to go
on a field trip today.

748
01:06:12.708 --> 01:06:15.500
- Is that OK?
- Mmm.

749
01:06:19.792 --> 01:06:21.708
Ms. Edmunds? Yeah, I can go.

750
01:06:29.917 --> 01:06:31.667
- All set?
- Yeah.

751
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:33.167
- Yeah?
- Yes, ma'am.

752
01:06:40.417 --> 01:06:42.375
Forget something?

753
01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:46.667
No. I'm good.

754
01:07:22.833 --> 01:07:24.500
Wow.

755
01:07:29.875 --> 01:07:31.500
Honey, honey, stay here.

756
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:37.333
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.

757
01:07:37.375 --> 01:07:40.500
It's Brueghel.
It's one of my favorites.

758
01:07:40.542 --> 01:07:43.917
I wonder if he started in notebooks
like you. I know da Vinci did.

759
01:07:48.708 --> 01:07:51.833
It's amazing how much
detail's put into it.

760
01:07:51.875 --> 01:07:54.208
You've been to a museum before, right?

761
01:07:54.292 --> 01:07:57.708
- No, it's my first time.
- Really?

762
01:07:57.792 --> 01:08:00.542
- Yup.
- Well, then I'm honored.

763
01:08:40.083 --> 01:08:41.875
It's such a nice day out.

764
01:08:41.958 --> 01:08:46.250
It's been raining so much, I began
to think it was like that Japanese myth

765
01:08:46.333 --> 01:08:50.333
where the sun goes into the cave
and vows never to come out.

766
01:08:50.417 --> 01:08:53.625
- You know about everything.
- Not by a long shot.

767
01:08:53.708 --> 01:08:55.708
But I do try to keep an open mind,

768
01:08:55.792 --> 01:08:58.375
and you'd be surprised
what finds its way in there.

769
01:08:58.458 --> 01:09:02.125
That's what Leslie Burke says.
She told me to keep my mind wide open.

770
01:09:02.208 --> 01:09:03.875
Leslie Burke is right.

771
01:09:03.917 --> 01:09:07.583
Mind like yours wide open,
you could create a whole new world.

772
01:09:15.458 --> 01:09:19.333
- Thank you very much.
- You're very welcome.

773
01:09:19.417 --> 01:09:23.042
- Maybe we could do this again sometime.
- Absolutely.

774
01:09:27.833 --> 01:09:30.292
- Hey, guys.
- See? I told you.

775
01:09:30.375 --> 01:09:32.417
Oh, my God, Jess!

776
01:09:34.083 --> 01:09:37.375
- Where in God's name have you been?
- Where have you been?

777
01:09:38.542 --> 01:09:40.875
Mom...

778
01:09:40.917 --> 01:09:43.417
I asked you. It wasn't like I...

779
01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:46.208
- They thought you were dead.
- Brenda, hush.

780
01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:48.042
Dead?

781
01:09:49.250 --> 01:09:51.042
What's going on?

782
01:09:57.792 --> 01:10:00.208
Your friend Leslie's dead.

783
01:10:02.042 --> 01:10:03.875
She drowned in a creek this morning.

784
01:10:03.917 --> 01:10:07.542
Apparently she tried to swing
across on a rope and it broke.

785
01:10:07.625 --> 01:10:09.875
They think she hit her head.

786
01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:15.167
No... No, it's not that kind of rope.

787
01:10:15.250 --> 01:10:18.875
It couldn't break.
It... wouldn't have.

788
01:10:18.917 --> 01:10:20.958
But it did.

789
01:10:24.250 --> 01:10:27.875
- I'm sorry, son.
- No, you're lying.

790
01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:32.792
- She's not even dead. You're lying!
- Jess!

791
01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.250
Hi, honey. You want some breakfast?

792
01:12:10.333 --> 01:12:13.083
I... I gotta do my chores first.

793
01:12:13.167 --> 01:12:15.917
Your dad's doing everything today.
You just sit down.

794
01:12:31.958 --> 01:12:33.708
Jess, your father and I thought

795
01:12:33.792 --> 01:12:36.417
we'd go to the Burkes today
and pay our respects.

796
01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:38.833
Just the three of us.

797
01:12:39.875 --> 01:12:41.292
Paying what?

798
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:04.500
Prince Terrien. Shh.

799
01:13:05.417 --> 01:13:07.333
You must be Jess.

800
01:13:16.542 --> 01:13:21.250
I'm Mr. Aarons. This is my wife, Mary.
Very sorry about your loss.

801
01:13:21.333 --> 01:13:23.875
- I'm so sorry.
- Hi, Jess.

802
01:13:31.875 --> 01:13:33.875
She loved you, you know.

803
01:13:34.875 --> 01:13:36.375
You know, Leslie,

804
01:13:36.458 --> 01:13:40.375
she never had much luck
making friends at her old school.

805
01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:43.792
We were hoping that when
we moved out here she would...

806
01:13:48.042 --> 01:13:50.458
She said
if it wasn't for you...

807
01:13:52.875 --> 01:13:55.125
You're the best friend she's ever had.

808
01:13:55.208 --> 01:13:57.167
I wanna thank you for that.

809
01:13:58.667 --> 01:14:00.750
You're welcome.

810
01:14:03.833 --> 01:14:06.833
My wife and I were wondering
about the service.

811
01:14:10.375 --> 01:14:13.958
We've decided to bring Leslie
back home until the service.

812
01:14:19.708 --> 01:14:23.708
- Jess.
- Next time,

813
01:14:23.792 --> 01:14:26.750
we should invite Leslie to go.

814
01:14:28.625 --> 01:14:30.833
She'd like that.

815
01:14:40.292 --> 01:14:41.833
Hey, kid.

816
01:14:43.292 --> 01:14:45.417
Sorry about your friend.

817
01:14:47.917 --> 01:14:52.417
The purpose
of object pronouns...

818
01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:55.625
So looks like you're
the fastest kid in the class now, huh?

819
01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.083
It's a joke, dude.

820
01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:06.708
- Are you nuts?
- Jess Aarons.

821
01:15:07.292 --> 01:15:09.417
Go wait for me out in the hall.

822
01:15:10.833 --> 01:15:13.292
Silent reading until I get back.

823
01:15:22.625 --> 01:15:24.375
Jess...

824
01:15:31.042 --> 01:15:33.958
When my husband died...

825
01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000
...people kept telling me not to cry.

826
01:15:38.125 --> 01:15:40.500
People kept trying to help me to forget.

827
01:15:43.792 --> 01:15:46.125
But I didn't wanna forget.

828
01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:48.542
Excuse me.

829
01:15:51.292 --> 01:15:53.917
The things that girl came up with.

830
01:15:55.958 --> 01:15:58.542
I don't get students like her too often.

831
01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:05.583
So I realize...

832
01:16:05.625 --> 01:16:08.375
...that if it's hard for me...

833
01:16:08.458 --> 01:16:10.958
...how much harder it must be for you.

834
01:16:58.542 --> 01:17:00.708
Hurry up.
We're gonna miss the bus!

835
01:17:10.083 --> 01:17:11.833
Hey.

836
01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.042
Leslie?!

837
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:27.875
Jess!

838
01:18:27.958 --> 01:18:29.458
Leslie!

839
01:18:29.542 --> 01:18:33.000
- Jess!
- Leslie!

840
01:18:39.458 --> 01:18:41.083
Lesl...

841
01:18:41.167 --> 01:18:44.125
Help me, I can't get across! Hurry!

842
01:18:45.333 --> 01:18:47.333
May Belle?

843
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:51.958
Hold on! Don't move!

844
01:18:53.583 --> 01:18:56.083
Here, grab my arm.
I got you, don't worry.

845
01:19:01.417 --> 01:19:03.958
- What were you thinking?
- I was worried about you!

846
01:19:04.042 --> 01:19:06.833
Well, don't be. I don't want you here!

847
01:19:07.458 --> 01:19:10.250
- But I wanna come with you.
- This is our place. Go home.

848
01:19:10.333 --> 01:19:12.167
This is our place!

849
01:19:16.333 --> 01:19:17.667
I said go home!

850
01:19:32.792 --> 01:19:34.667
Honey, what's the matter?

851
01:19:35.625 --> 01:19:37.583
What's the matter?

852
01:19:37.667 --> 01:19:39.583
What's the matter, baby?

853
01:20:44.208 --> 01:20:45.917
No!

854
01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:49.208
Jess!

855
01:20:50.208 --> 01:20:53.000
It's OK, Jess.
It's OK, son, it's OK.

856
01:20:53.042 --> 01:20:54.833
It's all gone.

857
01:20:58.333 --> 01:21:00.792
Is it like the Bible says?

858
01:21:00.875 --> 01:21:02.750
Is she going to hell?

859
01:21:03.458 --> 01:21:05.250
I don't know everything about God,

860
01:21:05.333 --> 01:21:08.208
but I do know He's not
gonna send that little girl to hell.

861
01:21:08.250 --> 01:21:11.625
Then I'm going to hell
because it's all my fault.

862
01:21:11.708 --> 01:21:15.375
Don't you think that even for a minute.

863
01:21:15.458 --> 01:21:18.083
But it is.

864
01:21:18.167 --> 01:21:22.375
I didn't invite her
to go to the museum with me.

865
01:21:22.458 --> 01:21:25.792
I didn't wanna invite her.

866
01:21:25.875 --> 01:21:29.167
I wasn't there to go with her.

867
01:21:29.208 --> 01:21:32.333
- It's my fault.
- No, no, no, no.

868
01:21:32.417 --> 01:21:34.583
It's not your fault.

869
01:21:34.667 --> 01:21:37.292
None of that makes it so.

870
01:21:37.375 --> 01:21:39.542
It's a terrible thing.

871
01:21:39.625 --> 01:21:44.250
It doesn't make any sense,
but it's not your fault, Jess.

872
01:21:49.292 --> 01:21:52.958
She brought you something special
when she came here, didn't she?

873
01:21:56.125 --> 01:21:58.542
That's what you hold on to.

874
01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:04.083
That's how you keep her alive.

875
01:22:24.333 --> 01:22:25.667
May Belle?

876
01:22:34.375 --> 01:22:35.750
Look.

877
01:22:37.542 --> 01:22:39.417
I'm sorry I pushed you.

878
01:22:41.625 --> 01:22:44.875
That was stupid and wrong...

879
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.083
...and I really miss you talking to me.

880
01:23:29.458 --> 01:23:31.875
She's in your hands now.

881
01:23:55.125 --> 01:23:56.250
Hey!

882
01:23:58.083 --> 01:23:59.375
Wait!

883
01:24:01.417 --> 01:24:02.458
Wait!

884
01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:06.167
Hey!

885
01:24:12.083 --> 01:24:15.167
Jess? I'm sorry.
I didn't... I didn't see you.

886
01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:19.000
Can I use the lumber by your house?

887
01:24:19.083 --> 01:24:20.750
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

888
01:24:20.833 --> 01:24:23.542
Anything you see, you just...

889
01:24:24.417 --> 01:24:27.792
You know, I meant to...
I meant to give you Prince Terrien,

890
01:24:27.875 --> 01:24:31.083
but I... can't seem to give him up.

891
01:24:32.917 --> 01:24:35.000
Leslie would've wanted you to have him.

892
01:24:35.083 --> 01:24:36.625
Yeah.

893
01:26:00.042 --> 01:26:03.417
We're playing. By ourselves.

894
01:26:04.917 --> 01:26:08.875
OK, but I know the most
incredible place to play.

895
01:26:08.958 --> 01:26:12.042
You gotta promise you're
not gonna tell anybody about it.

896
01:26:12.083 --> 01:26:16.208
Not Brenda, not Ellie, not even Joycie.

897
01:26:16.292 --> 01:26:19.875
Tell Joycie a secret between you and me?

898
01:26:19.958 --> 01:26:21.500
She's nothing but a baby.

899
01:26:21.583 --> 01:26:24.833
You're right, and she's not ready
to be a princess yet.

900
01:26:24.917 --> 01:26:26.750
You have to train her and stuff.

901
01:26:26.833 --> 01:26:29.875
Princess? Who gets to be the princess?

902
01:26:39.625 --> 01:26:41.375
Step down.

903
01:26:44.833 --> 01:26:46.250
Watch your step.

904
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:55.583
You're not peeking, are you?

905
01:26:57.667 --> 01:27:00.458
Step up. There you go.

906
01:27:07.875 --> 01:27:09.667
All right.

907
01:27:16.083 --> 01:27:18.083
OK. Open them.

908
01:27:23.833 --> 01:27:27.875
Wow. Did you make this?

909
01:27:29.333 --> 01:27:31.042
Yep.

910
01:27:33.875 --> 01:27:35.667
Hold on a second.

911
01:27:44.333 --> 01:27:47.708
Look! They must've heard the rumor,

912
01:27:47.792 --> 01:27:52.542
that the beautiful girl arriving today
is the new future ruler of Terabithia.

913
01:27:52.625 --> 01:27:55.917
- Who heard?
- The Terabithians.

914
01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.250
They've been waiting.

915
01:27:58.333 --> 01:28:00.333
Where?

916
01:28:00.417 --> 01:28:03.875
- I don't see them.
- It's an ancient forest, May Belle,

917
01:28:03.958 --> 01:28:06.333
full of magical creatures
and friendly giants,

918
01:28:06.417 --> 01:28:08.708
anything you can imagine.

919
01:28:08.792 --> 01:28:10.750
But you gotta look really hard.

920
01:28:10.792 --> 01:28:13.708
But keep your mind wide open.

921
01:28:22.333 --> 01:28:24.167
So, what do you think?

922
01:28:28.583 --> 01:28:31.000
Can there be purple flowers?

923
01:28:33.125 --> 01:28:35.542
Anything you want.

924
01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:38.500
Wow.

925
01:28:39.917 --> 01:28:41.208
And a castle.

926
01:28:41.292 --> 01:28:44.083
A big one, with towers and flags.

927
01:28:44.125 --> 01:28:46.458
Of course.

928
01:28:49.292 --> 01:28:52.125
Look, Jess. It's beautiful.

929
01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.708
Is there a king?

930
01:28:57.792 --> 01:28:59.208
Are you the king, Jess?

931
01:28:59.292 --> 01:29:01.875
Only if you're princess.

932
01:29:47.417 --> 01:29:49.792
Terabithia.
