00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.191
<i>ANNOUNCER:
Writer/Director Martin Scorsese.</i>

2
00:00:25.274 --> 00:00:27.331
<i>SCORSESE: It all
started from a newspaper</i>

3
00:00:27.355 --> 00:00:29.774
<i>article about Lefty
Rosenthal's car exploding.</i>

4
00:00:30.154 --> 00:00:32.948
<i>And then it says in the article</i>

5
00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:36.076
<i>that he was friends with
Tony Spilotro, his wife,</i>

6
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.205
<i>there was a triangle, a romantic
triangle, and somehow, all of this</i>

7
00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:43.250
<i>was just the tip of the iceberg,
this was the culmination</i>

8
00:00:43.334 --> 00:00:46.086
<i>of an extraordinary history</i>

9
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.215
<i>of what Las Vegas had
become and was no longer.</i>

10
00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:53.219
SAM: When you love
someone, you've gotta trust them.

11
00:00:53.302 --> 00:00:54.386
There's no other way.

12
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.722
<i>ANNOUNCER: Editor
Thelma Schoonmaker.</i>

13
00:00:56.806 --> 00:00:58.766
<i>SCHOONMAKER: I think
Marty just always knew</i>

14
00:00:58.849 --> 00:01:01.560
<i>with his wonderful
gut instinct for cinema</i>

15
00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:05.022
<i>that to begin the film with
an explosion was a great idea</i>

16
00:01:05.147 --> 00:01:09.067
<i>and then leave it as a mystery
for people whether he lived or died.</i>

17
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:13.651
<i>But the explosion, of course, the
great Saul Bass and his wife Elaine</i>

18
00:01:14.323 --> 00:01:18.327
<i>when they were asked to do the
titles, of course, they took that explosion</i>

19
00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:21.372
<i>and made this
beautiful title sequence</i>

20
00:01:21.497 --> 00:01:25.375
<i>of our main character
falling slowly into hell.</i>

21
00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:28.588
<i>It was such a great idea,
and beautifully realized.</i>

22
00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:30.464
<i>They showed it to
us. It was perfect.</i>

23
00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:31.632
<i>We didn't change a thing,</i>

24
00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:32.758
<i>(LAUGHS)</i>

25
00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:34.009
<i>as usual with them.</i>

26
00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:38.347
<i>It was one of those great artistic
collaborations that Marty has,</i>

27
00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:41.517
<i>similar to the one he
had with Elmer Bernstein.</i>

28
00:01:42.518 --> 00:01:44.770
<i>They just understood
each other immediately.</i>

29
00:01:44.854 --> 00:01:47.773
<i>They both knew the
entire history of film.</i>

30
00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:52.069
<i>And Marty was well aware of
Saul's work with Hitchcock, of course.</i>

31
00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:55.113
<i>So they were just at a common
understanding immediately.</i>

32
00:01:55.197 --> 00:01:57.157
<i>There wasn't much need to talk.</i>

33
00:01:57.241 --> 00:02:00.953
<i>And as usual, they just brought us
the title sequence, and it was perfect.</i>

34
00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:02.913
<i>I mean, one hardly had to say,</i>

35
00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.084
<i>"Maybe could we move that
name earlier," or something like that.</i>

36
00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:08.335
<i>But it was just perfect.</i>

37
00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.130
<i>They came to Las Vegas,
shot all the Las Vegas lights</i>

38
00:02:11.213 --> 00:02:14.591
<i>and went away and just came
back with a little masterpiece.</i>

39
00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:17.219
<i>ANNOUNCER: Martin Scorsese.</i>

40
00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:21.473
<i>SCORSESE: The use of the Bach
music, the Saint <i>Matthew</i> Passion

41
00:02:21.557 --> 00:02:23.141
<i>which is over the top.</i>

42
00:02:23.225 --> 00:02:27.725
<i>Originally, the film was gonna
open with the music I used at the end.</i>

43
00:02:27.813 --> 00:02:31.024
<i>The Animals' version of</i>
House <i>of the</i> Rising Sun.

44
00:02:31.108 --> 00:02:35.028
<i>And that's where the body was going
to be flying in the air. That was designed.</i>

45
00:02:35.112 --> 00:02:36.488
<i>It's in the script.</i>

46
00:02:36.572 --> 00:02:40.158
<i>The script is very close to
what the picture became,</i>

47
00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:44.079
<i>the design of De Niro's
character Rothstein flying in the air.</i>

48
00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:47.332
<i>And then Saul and Elaine Bass
put that title sequence together.</i>

49
00:02:47.416 --> 00:02:51.711
<i>I thought it'd be more interesting to
blast it and have the sense of the music</i>

50
00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:54.423
<i>that is sacred
music, in a sense.</i>

51
00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:57.635
<i>Sacred music,</i> Saint
Matthew Passion.

52
00:02:58.094 --> 00:03:01.180
<i>Sacred music, which
is the soundtrack</i>

53
00:03:01.263 --> 00:03:04.266
<i>for a story about
people who are profane</i>

54
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.937
<i>because the idea is that, in Christian
thinking, there is no such thing.</i>

55
00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:11.565
<i>Every person is
worth God's love.</i>

56
00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:14.193
<i>Every person is worth
the value of their life.</i>

57
00:03:14.276 --> 00:03:17.028
<i>ls everyone irredeemable?
Those are my thoughts.</i>

58
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.198
<i>I don't say that to the actor.</i>

59
00:03:19.281 --> 00:03:22.701
<i>But this goes on in my mind, "Why
shouldn't they have their paradise?"</i>

60
00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:26.705
<i>It's like the gods... Okay,
they are a step down, certainly</i>

61
00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:33.962
<i>in a sense or
scale of who is God.</i>

62
00:03:34.672 --> 00:03:38.634
<i>In a sense, these are the pagan gods,
which give them a pagan paradise, in a way.</i>

63
00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:40.678
<i>But these guys in Chicago...</i>

64
00:03:40.803 --> 00:03:43.055
<i>But it's interesting
that given that, too,</i>

65
00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.642
<i>these characters sin further
and lose that paradise.</i>

66
00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:50.062
<i>So in any event, the
way I could remember it</i>

67
00:03:50.146 --> 00:03:52.940
<i>when I did The</i> Last Temptation
<i>of</i> Christ <i>at Universal...</i>

68
00:03:53.023 --> 00:03:55.900
<i>Actually it was an independent
film picked up by Universal.</i>

69
00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:57.736
<i>Mike Ovitz at CAA
worked out a deal</i>

70
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.364
<i>between myself and
Universal with Tom Pollock</i>

71
00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.866
<i>to be under
contract at Universal.</i>

72
00:04:02.992 --> 00:04:06.996
<i>And that led to working on a
number of projects at Universal,</i>

73
00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.331
<i>one of which was</i> Cape Fear.

74
00:04:09.498 --> 00:04:11.875
<i>Then I went</i> off to
do Age of Innocence.

75
00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:13.627
<i>Universal was in
the bidding on that.</i>

76
00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:15.963
<i>But they wanted to
give us less in the budget</i>

77
00:04:16.046 --> 00:04:19.466
<i>and Columbia Pictures wanted to
give us more, so we went with Columbia.</i>

78
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.512
<i>And then I owed
a film to Universal.</i>

79
00:04:27.683 --> 00:04:31.103
SAM: But it's in the desert where
lots of the town's problems are solved.

80
00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:33.189
NICKY: Got a lot
of holes in the desert

81
00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:36.316
and a lot of problems
are buried in those holes.

82
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.110
Except you gotta do it right.

83
00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:39.945
You gotta have
the hole already dug

84
00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:42.281
before you show up with
a package in the trunk.

85
00:04:42.364 --> 00:04:44.366
<i>ANNOUNCER:
Producer Barbara De Fina.</i>

86
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.743
<i>DE FINA: We were
developing</i> Clockers.

87
00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:51.290
<i>And my recollection is that after developing
it and working with Richard Price,</i>

88
00:04:51.373 --> 00:04:55.460
<i>Marty decided that maybe it wasn't
something that he should direct,</i>

89
00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:56.211
<i>Marty decided that maybe it wasn't
something that he should direct,</i>

90
00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:58.797
<i>you know, in a way, it
wasn't his neighborhood,</i>

91
00:04:58.881 --> 00:05:01.675
<i>it wasn't his thing.</i>

92
00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:05.679
<i>So he felt that ultimately
Spike should do it,</i>

93
00:05:05.763 --> 00:05:09.475
<i>which turned out to be great,
and it was a great collaboration.</i>

94
00:05:09.558 --> 00:05:13.812
<i>Meanwhile, of course, he always had that
wonderful relationship with Nick Pileggi</i>

95
00:05:13.896 --> 00:05:15.022
<i>since</i> Goodfellas.

96
00:05:15.105 --> 00:05:18.149
<i>Nick hadn't actually
finished writing the book.</i>

97
00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:21.528
<i>So it was a much different
process developing Casino</i>

98
00:05:21.612 --> 00:05:25.198
<i>because with</i> Goodfellas,
<i>he had the book finished</i>

99
00:05:25.282 --> 00:05:29.782
<i>and it was an easier process adapting
from a book, which had a real structure.</i>

100
00:05:30.454 --> 00:05:33.039
<i>And in this case, it
was like a pile of notes.</i>

101
00:05:33.123 --> 00:05:37.502
<i>And they were trying to
write the script when the book</i>

102
00:05:37.586 --> 00:05:39.963
<i>hadn't really become formed yet.</i>

103
00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:42.841
<i>By the time the movie was
finished, the book was finished.</i>

104
00:05:42.925 --> 00:05:45.886
<i>So if you look at the credits,
it says, "Based on the book."</i>

105
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.765
<i>But actually, they wrote the
screenplay before the book was done.</i>

106
00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:51.892
<i>ANNOUNCER:
Author/Screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi.</i>

107
00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:54.019
<i>Pileggi: Originally I started
writing this as a book.</i>

108
00:05:54.103 --> 00:05:56.105
<i>I was working on</i>
Goodfellas <i>at the time</i>

109
00:05:56.188 --> 00:05:58.356
<i>and once that was pretty
much out of the way,</i>

110
00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.317
<i>Marty knew I was doing this
book on the casino business</i>

111
00:06:01.402 --> 00:06:05.902
<i>and I was just telling these bizarre stories,
the skim, and explained this stuff to him.</i>

112
00:06:06.115 --> 00:06:07.699
<i>He knew some of it.</i>

113
00:06:07.783 --> 00:06:11.036
<i>He had always been
interested in the casino world</i>

114
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.998
<i>because, if you think, in
Marty's case, he wanted...</i>

115
00:06:15.124 --> 00:06:17.376
<i>it's like a trilogy, I think.</i>

116
00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:18.960
Mean Streets.

117
00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:21.797
<i>Just kids, really street punks.</i>

118
00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:24.091
<i>I mean, he's
selling Jap adapters.</i>

119
00:06:24.174 --> 00:06:26.843
<i>I mean, you can't
be lower than that.</i>

120
00:06:27.136 --> 00:06:29.054
And <i>then</i> we go to Goodfellas.

121
00:06:29.138 --> 00:06:32.474
<i>But</i> Goodfellas <i>came
along quite a few years later</i>

122
00:06:32.558 --> 00:06:36.728
<i>and Marty was interested in the
kids from Mean Streets growing up.</i>

123
00:06:36.812 --> 00:06:39.898
<i>This is who they were, and he knew
who they were better than anybody.</i>

124
00:06:39.982 --> 00:06:44.403
<i>And he understood that while they lived
big and they could go to the Copacabana,</i>

125
00:06:44.486 --> 00:06:46.321
<i>it was still not...</i>

126
00:06:46.655 --> 00:06:49.240
<i>It was all coming
down. It all crashed.</i>

127
00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:52.328
<i>And that was the second level,
sort of the middle-class mob.</i>

128
00:06:52.411 --> 00:06:55.997
<i>But he was also fascinated
by the top of the mob world.</i>

129
00:06:56.081 --> 00:06:57.957
<i>And that, of course,
is the casinos.</i>

130
00:06:58.042 --> 00:07:01.628
<i>Where is the mob better
situated in those days</i>

131
00:07:01.712 --> 00:07:03.714
<i>than Las Vegas and the casinos?</i>

132
00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:07.092
<i>'Cause they, through their
connections, actually own the casinos.</i>

133
00:07:07.176 --> 00:07:09.970
<i>Their names couldn't be on
them because they were crooked.</i>

134
00:07:10.054 --> 00:07:14.349
<i>But they own the casinos and
skim them of millions of dollars.</i>

135
00:07:15.476 --> 00:07:17.936
NICKY: They'd even take
cash right out of the drop-boxes.

136
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.938
And it was up to
this guy right here,

137
00:07:20.022 --> 00:07:21.606
standing in front
of $2 million...

138
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.400
<i>ANNOUNCER: Martin Scorsese.</i>

139
00:07:23.484 --> 00:07:26.612
<i>SCORSESE: The whole film
was really carefully planned out.</i>

140
00:07:26.695 --> 00:07:30.990
<i>It was restructured in the
editing, for a number of reasons.</i>

141
00:07:31.075 --> 00:07:34.328
<i>We often do that. We
couldn't do it in this film.</i>

142
00:07:34.411 --> 00:07:36.663
<i>A number of others,</i> Raging Bull.

143
00:07:36.747 --> 00:07:38.623
The Temptation
of Christ, we <i>didn't.</i>

144
00:07:38.707 --> 00:07:40.333
<i>But sometimes you
take a sequence...</i>

145
00:07:40.417 --> 00:07:43.711
<i>Also, the style of a picture,
you could move things around</i>

146
00:07:43.837 --> 00:07:46.005
<i>if you stay within
certain time periods.</i>

147
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.259
<i>One of the things is the
documentary aspect of the movie,</i>

148
00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:52.638
<i>how things work in Vegas, we
found we had to move that up earlier.</i>

149
00:07:52.721 --> 00:07:54.305
<i>I had it in the
middle of the film.</i>

150
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:57.518
<i>One sequence about a fellow
coming out of a cab, going inside,</i>

151
00:07:57.601 --> 00:08:02.022
<i>putting the money in a bag and going out,
as simple as that. That's the way it was.</i>

152
00:08:02.106 --> 00:08:04.691
NICKY: Now, that suitcase
was going straight to one place,

153
00:08:04.775 --> 00:08:07.527
right to Kansas City,
which was as close

154
00:08:07.611 --> 00:08:10.238
to Las Vegas as the
Midwest bosses could go...

155
00:08:10.406 --> 00:08:11.949
<i>ANNOUNCER: Thelma Schoonmaker.</i>

156
00:08:12.032 --> 00:08:15.410
<i>SCHOONMAKER: We did

<i>and we rewrote a lot in that.</i>

158

<i>where we were able
to restructure a lot</i>

160
00:08:23.794 --> 00:08:25.629

<i>and everybody was always
wearing the same clothes.</i>

162
00:08:27.423 --> 00:08:28.674
<i>(LAUGHS)</i>

163
00:08:28.757 --> 00:08:29.841
<i>They were always
dressed like monks.</i>

164
00:08:29.925 --> 00:08:32.802
<i>And the Lord Chamberlain
always wore the same clothes</i>

165
00:08:32.886 --> 00:08:37.386
<i>and the court always looked basically
the same until they go into exile.</i>

166
00:08:38.434 --> 00:08:42.104
<i>So we have done a lot of
restructuring and rewriting</i>

167
00:08:42.396 --> 00:08:44.940
<i>in some of the films recently.</i>

168
00:08:45.274 --> 00:08:49.774
<i>But it's always fascinating, our
conversations in the editing room.</i>

169
00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:54.946
<i>They're often about life or
things that Marty is worried about.</i>

170
00:08:55.576 --> 00:08:58.787
<i>So it's a constant
rich thing for me</i>

171
00:08:58.912 --> 00:09:02.624
<i>that our discussions
there are so wide-ranging</i>

172
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.961
<i>or we'll talk about
history or archaeology</i>

173
00:09:07.129 --> 00:09:10.841
<i>or remark on films that are
on TCM with no sound running.</i>

174
00:09:10.966 --> 00:09:15.303
<i>I'll look over and see a great shot,
and Marty will talk to me about that.</i>

175
00:09:15.846 --> 00:09:20.308
<i>It's been the way a friendship
develops over a long period of time.</i>

176
00:09:20.476 --> 00:09:21.768
NICKY: ...the outfit's top boss.

177
00:09:21.852 --> 00:09:23.395
You got a round figure on it?

178
00:09:23.479 --> 00:09:26.482
NICKY: Definitely the most
important guy in this room.

179
00:09:27.649 --> 00:09:28.941
<i>ANNOUNCER: Barbara De Fina.</i>

180
00:09:29.026 --> 00:09:32.112
<i>DE FINA: The movie, it does
have a lot of information in it.</i>

181
00:09:32.196 --> 00:09:35.073
<i>Especially at the beginning,
there's a lot of back-story,</i>

182
00:09:35.157 --> 00:09:37.159
<i>a lot of explanation</i>

183
00:09:37.284 --> 00:09:41.496
<i>about how the casino works and
how they were skimming the money.</i>

184
00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:46.330
<i>I think, to get through all
that, it needed a lot of energy.</i>

185
00:09:47.336 --> 00:09:50.589
<i>It needed something
to keep you moving.</i>

186
00:09:50.672 --> 00:09:54.175
<i>And so the camera
is moving all the time,</i>

187
00:09:54.468 --> 00:09:56.428
<i>and hopefully seamlessly moving,</i>

188
00:09:56.512 --> 00:10:01.012
<i>and keeping you constantly interested
and showing you different things</i>

189
00:10:01.975 --> 00:10:06.187
<i>and hopefully you're absorbing
everything without getting bored</i>

190
00:10:06.313 --> 00:10:08.773
<i>and overwhelmed, and
then there's voice over.</i>

191
00:10:08.857 --> 00:10:11.484
<i>So there's just a lot of energy,</i>

192
00:10:13.028 --> 00:10:17.323
<i>sort of wheeling you through to
get all the information that you need</i>

193
00:10:17.407 --> 00:10:19.325
<i>to get into the real narrative.</i>

194
00:10:19.409 --> 00:10:20.910
<i>ANNOUNCER: Thelma Schoonmaker.</i>

195
00:10:20.994 --> 00:10:25.494
<i>SCHOONMAKER: I think Marty
had hoped that we could show</i>

196
00:10:25.707 --> 00:10:30.207
<i>what was going on, how the
skim was happening in Las Vegas.</i>

197
00:10:30.587 --> 00:10:33.256
<i>But we found after
some screenings</i>

198
00:10:33.382 --> 00:10:37.469
<i>that we probably had to say a little
more in voice over than we thought.</i>

199
00:10:37.553 --> 00:10:41.598
<i>So that became a big
part of making the movie,</i>

200
00:10:41.723 --> 00:10:46.144
<i>writing, rewriting the
voice over to get it just right</i>

201
00:10:46.228 --> 00:10:49.940
<i>so it had a personal flavor,
but was still telling the story.</i>

202
00:10:50.065 --> 00:10:53.485
<i>And, of course, Nick Pileggi was
working constantly with us on that.</i>

203
00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:56.655
<i>And we had to re-record
over and over again the actors,</i>

204
00:10:56.738 --> 00:10:58.823
<i>which happened also
on Age of</i> Innocence

205
00:10:58.907 --> 00:11:03.202
<i>with the voice over, we kept rewriting,
re-recording it as the film went on.</i>

206
00:11:03.287 --> 00:11:06.832
<i>So we ended up with a lot more
voice over in the beginning of the film</i>

207
00:11:06.915 --> 00:11:08.750
<i>than was originally intended.</i>

208
00:11:08.876 --> 00:11:11.003
<i>But it's filled with
such flavor, you know.</i>

209
00:11:11.086 --> 00:11:12.504
<i>(LAUGHS)</i>

210
00:11:12.588 --> 00:11:16.091
<i>Particularly Joe
Pesci's lines are...</i>

211
00:11:16.216 --> 00:11:19.052
<i>They're so surprising. I mean,
the way he describes things.</i>

212
00:11:19.136 --> 00:11:22.681
<i>Just this kind of slap in the
face, a good slap in the face.</i>

213
00:11:22.764 --> 00:11:27.264
<i>So that became a big part of the
film, making the voice over work right.</i>

214
00:11:28.937 --> 00:11:30.730
<i>ANNOUNCER: Martin Scorsese.</i>

215
00:11:30.814 --> 00:11:34.692
<i>SCORSESE: in terms of revisiting</i>

216
00:11:34.776 --> 00:11:37.403
<i>in a sense, "a gangster genre"</i>

217
00:11:37.487 --> 00:11:41.987
<i>and deal with it, in my mind, you've
got these extraordinary characters</i>

218
00:11:42.492 --> 00:11:46.992
<i>who are given paradise
by the gods in Chicago.</i>

219
00:11:48.957 --> 00:11:52.418
<i>This group of men
who rule over Chicago,</i>

220
00:11:52.502 --> 00:11:54.879
<i>Zeus and the others,
they're given paradise.</i>

221
00:11:54.963 --> 00:11:58.299
<i>And they sin. They sin
and they lose paradise.</i>

222
00:11:58.967 --> 00:12:02.261
<i>And paradise then crumbles
and collapses all around them.</i>

223
00:12:03.805 --> 00:12:08.017
NICKY: They wanted him because
Ace ate, slept and breathed gambling.

224
00:12:10.604 --> 00:12:12.063
<i>ANNOUNCER: Nicholas Pileggi.</i>

225
00:12:12.147 --> 00:12:15.650
<i>PILEGGI: They were given
four Las Vegas casinos to run.</i>

226
00:12:15.817 --> 00:12:20.154
<i>All these casinos do is churn
out millions of dollars a day.</i>

227
00:12:20.447 --> 00:12:22.323
<i>And they screwed it up.</i>

228
00:12:22.449 --> 00:12:25.076
<i>That's because these guys
are always gonna screw it up.</i>

229
00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.660
<i>They are so willful and so in
need of immediate gratification.</i>

230
00:12:30.666 --> 00:12:35.166
<i>And so blind as to what the
consequences of their acts are</i>

231
00:12:36.672 --> 00:12:39.383
<i>that in the end, they
screw it up and it's so,</i>

232
00:12:39.508 --> 00:12:43.553
<i>I guess you could call it biblical,
or you can call it Darwinian.</i>

233
00:12:43.845 --> 00:12:46.556
<i>But whatever it is, it
makes for great drama.</i>

234
00:12:46.682 --> 00:12:49.559
<i>And I think Marty agrees. I
think it makes for great drama,</i>

235
00:12:49.643 --> 00:12:52.812
<i>that makes for pretty good
movies, if you can get it right.</i>

236
00:12:52.896 --> 00:12:54.439
<i>ANNOUNCER: Martin Scorsese.</i>

237
00:12:54.523 --> 00:12:59.023
<i>SCORSESE: It's sort of the
devouring of all material objects.</i>

238
00:13:00.028 --> 00:13:04.528
<i>This extraordinary need
for accumulation of wealth,</i>

239
00:13:05.033 --> 00:13:09.533
<i>accumulation of objects, accumulation
of, what, everything physical.</i>

240
00:13:11.206 --> 00:13:14.500
<i>And ultimately,
there's never enough.</i>

241
00:13:14.584 --> 00:13:19.084
<i>And the Vegas of the
703 in this film was...</i>

242
00:13:19.423 --> 00:13:21.425
<i>That's what the main
impulse was about.</i>

243
00:13:21.508 --> 00:13:23.843
<i>Never enough for
anybody, the greed.</i>

244
00:13:24.094 --> 00:13:25.637
<i>It's part of the
human condition.</i>

245
00:13:25.721 --> 00:13:28.515
<i>They're not the only greedy
ones. We see it all around,</i>

246
00:13:28.598 --> 00:13:31.475
<i>especially in governments,
and certainly in big business,</i>

247
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.354
<i>even much more so
than organized crime.</i>

248
00:13:34.521 --> 00:13:37.649
<i>Particularly, it's been proven
in American society recently.</i>

249
00:13:37.733 --> 00:13:41.862
<i>Over and over again in American society,
and also other cultures around the world.</i>

250
00:13:41.945 --> 00:13:46.445
<i>But in any event, how much is enough?
When do you get enough in this life,</i>

251
00:13:46.908 --> 00:13:48.910
<i>especially in a society that is</i>

252
00:13:50.912 --> 00:13:54.957
<i>more and more ruled by
materialism, consumerism?</i>

253
00:13:55.208 --> 00:13:58.836
<i>And then, let's say there's a
spiritual side to America. There's faith.</i>

254
00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.589
<i>Well, faith is one
thing. Faith is very good.</i>

255
00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:04.884
<i>But the Dalai Lama had
said, "It's good to have faith,</i>

256
00:14:04.968 --> 00:14:07.220
<i>"but you also have to
have spiritual development."</i>

257
00:14:07.304 --> 00:14:08.888
<i>And that doesn't
necessarily mean</i>

258
00:14:08.972 --> 00:14:11.557
<i>that anybody with faith
has spiritual development.</i>

259
00:14:11.641 --> 00:14:13.225
<i>What is spiritual development?</i>

260
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:16.604
<i>In my mind, it's
thinking beyond yourself.</i>

261
00:14:17.397 --> 00:14:20.691
<i>I'm not saying I could do it. I'm
saying that's what interests me.</i>

262
00:14:20.776 --> 00:14:23.987
<i>And I made pictures like that
about characters like the Dalai Lama,</i>

263
00:14:24.071 --> 00:14:25.363
The Last Temptation of Christ.

264
00:14:25.447 --> 00:14:28.825
<i>Even in Mean Streets, there are
certain aspects about what you give,</i>

265
00:14:28.909 --> 00:14:30.201
<i>are you your brother's keeper?</i>

266
00:14:30.285 --> 00:14:32.036
<i>And in this film,
too, in</i> Casino,

267
00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.289
<i>they are friends, all
three of them are friends.</i>

268
00:14:35.457 --> 00:14:37.459
<i>They're close friends.</i>

269
00:14:37.793 --> 00:14:39.920
<i>They're irritable
with each other.</i>

270
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:42.213
<i>Joe Pesci's character.</i>

271
00:14:42.297 --> 00:14:45.383
<i>One has one way of doing
things. The other has the other way.</i>

272
00:14:45.467 --> 00:14:47.719
<i>And so there's a
relationship there</i>

273
00:14:47.803 --> 00:14:50.263
<i>and they do give to each
other in different ways.</i>

274
00:14:50.347 --> 00:14:54.309
<i>But ultimately it spins out of control
because there, there are no limits.</i>

275
00:14:54.434 --> 00:14:57.186
<i>You see, once they take
over as the gods of this place,</i>

276
00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.438
<i>and what makes them gods?
They make the place run.</i>

277
00:14:59.523 --> 00:15:04.023
<i>And what does that mean? It means
more money being made for the wiseguys.</i>

278
00:15:04.152 --> 00:15:06.070
<i>More money being
made for organized crime.</i>

279
00:15:06.154 --> 00:15:07.697
<i>That means they're successes.</i>

280
00:15:07.781 --> 00:15:10.450
<i>And when they get that, they
could do anything they want.</i>

281
00:15:10.534 --> 00:15:12.911
<i>In a sense, they're given
the sinners' paradise.</i>

282
00:15:12.994 --> 00:15:15.579
<i>But they lose that because they
become even worse sinners. That's right.</i>

00:15:15.664 --> 00:15:16.748
<i>(LAUGHS)</i>

284
00:15:16.832 --> 00:15:19.584
<i>And I thought, you
know, that was the idea.</i>

285
00:15:19.668 --> 00:15:22.712
<i>As you see them, they may
have had souls when they started,</i>

286
00:15:22.796 --> 00:15:24.047
<i>something of a soul,</i>

287
00:15:24.131 --> 00:15:27.509
<i>but as the film progresses,
they start to lose those souls.</i>

288

Ace, tell him the line

00:17:15.825 --> 00:17:17.868
<i>That's the way they
controlled the casinos.</i>

320
00:17:17.953 --> 00:17:21.081
<i>They controlled
members on the trustees</i>

321
00:17:21.164 --> 00:17:23.166
<i>of the central
state's pension fund.</i>

322
00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.335
<i>They were all
controlled by mob guys.</i>

323
00:17:25.418 --> 00:17:29.918
<i>And, not all but, I think, six
out of eight or four out of six,</i>

324
00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:31.841
<i>I can't remember,
but the majority.</i>

325
00:17:31.925 --> 00:17:36.304
<i>And therefore, they were
able to lend $62 million</i>

326
00:17:36.972 --> 00:17:39.766
<i>to Ace's friends</i>

327
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:41.768
<i>who then bought the casino,</i>

328
00:17:41.851 --> 00:17:45.229
<i>propped a guy up there
as the legitimate owner</i>

329
00:17:45.313 --> 00:17:49.358
<i>and brought Ace in to run it because
that guy didn't know how to run a casino.</i>

330
00:17:49.442 --> 00:17:52.111
<i>And Ace didn't even wanna
do it, he didn't wanna go.</i>

331
00:17:52.195 --> 00:17:56.695
<i>But he wound up going 'cause you
don't say no to those guys that often.</i>

332
00:17:56.992 --> 00:17:59.828
<i>But if you wind up just covering</i>

333
00:17:59.953 --> 00:18:02.914
<i>the financial manipulations
of the Teamster Pension Fund</i>

334
00:18:02.998 --> 00:18:07.498
<i>and the skim and all
that stuff done abstractly</i>

335
00:18:08.003 --> 00:18:11.715
<i>like a business report, there's
no way into a movie there.</i>

336
00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.802
<i>There's hardly a way into a book.
It becomes basically a treatise.</i>

337
00:18:16.011 --> 00:18:19.097
<i>It becomes something you
might read in a business school.</i>

338
00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.974
<i>Why this didn't work? Well,
it didn't work because we...</i>

339
00:18:22.058 --> 00:18:25.311
<i>But once you can
humanize the people</i>

340
00:18:25.395 --> 00:18:28.022
<i>because all of this is
being done by people.</i>

341
00:18:28.148 --> 00:18:31.276
<i>It may be numbers, but it's
numbers being written by people,</i>

342
00:18:31.359 --> 00:18:32.943
<i>being accumulated by people.</i>

343
00:18:33.028 --> 00:18:36.489
<i>Once you see the
people who are involved</i>

344
00:18:36.573 --> 00:18:41.073
<i>and then you find that they have
unbelievable soap-opera lives...</i>

345
00:18:41.661 --> 00:18:44.830
<i>And it's these soap-opera
lives, this insanity</i>

346
00:18:44.914 --> 00:18:48.876
<i>that brings down a
$200 million apparatus.</i>

347
00:18:49.002 --> 00:18:50.461
<i>It's just fascinating.</i>

348
00:18:50.545 --> 00:18:55.045
<i>And it's the story, the
narrative, the human story</i>

349
00:18:55.508 --> 00:18:57.760
<i>that gets you
into the big story.</i>

350
00:18:57.886 --> 00:19:02.386
<i>It makes the boringness
of actuarial numbers</i>

351
00:19:03.433 --> 00:19:07.933
<i>and the business stuff, it
makes that stuff fascinating.</i>

352
00:19:08.229 --> 00:19:12.233
<i>That's the key. You gotta get in
with the real story and real people.</i>

353
00:19:12.442 --> 00:19:14.610
<i>And I talked to these guys.</i>

354
00:19:15.111 --> 00:19:18.072
<i>I got their language.
I got them on tape.</i>

355
00:19:18.865 --> 00:19:22.535
<i>I have the way they sound,
and you can't write that</i>

356
00:19:22.869 --> 00:19:25.705
<i>in film school in Malibu,
at the side of a mountain,</i>

357
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:29.083
<i>no matter how many hallucinogens
you take, you can't write</i>

358
00:19:29.209 --> 00:19:32.545
<i>the way a guy out of the
Chicago gangs reports.</i>

359
00:19:32.754 --> 00:19:36.257
<i>Or a gambler in
New York, you can't...</i>

360
00:19:36.591 --> 00:19:39.885
<i>So when you've got that
body of dialogue, which it is,</i>

361
00:19:39.969 --> 00:19:43.931
<i>it's just all that language,
how can you not use it?</i>

362
00:19:44.599 --> 00:19:46.767
<i>Because he is
telling you the story.</i>

363
00:19:47.102 --> 00:19:49.896
<i>It's priceless.</i>

364
00:19:50.647 --> 00:19:54.108
<i>So to then put it all in
trumped-up dialogue</i>

365
00:19:54.234 --> 00:19:56.277
<i>and try to make it fit,</i>

366
00:19:56.486 --> 00:20:00.156
<i>there's no reason to do that,
you've got such a natural expression.</i>

367
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:04.740
<i>It's not me, I didn't write that. The
guy... I re-typed it, I cleaned it up.</i>

368
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.790
<i>I abridged stuff, I took out the
stuff about his mother-in-law.</i>

369
00:20:09.332 --> 00:20:11.792
<i>And Marty and I, we made it</i>

370
00:20:12.252 --> 00:20:14.504
<i>so that it was a
part of the narrative.</i>

371
00:20:14.587 --> 00:20:18.173
<i>You're hearing those guys talk.
When they talk, you are hearing...</i>

372
00:20:18.299 --> 00:20:22.011
<i>You may have never met a gangster,
but when you hear Henry Hill talk</i>

373
00:20:22.137 --> 00:20:25.557
<i>or when you hear Ace talk or
the Joe Pesci character talk,</i>

374
00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.433
<i>that's the way they talk.</i>

375
00:20:27.517 --> 00:20:29.894
SAM: But I knew the trick
with whales like ICHIKAWA

376
00:20:29.978 --> 00:20:32.230
was that they can't
bet small for long.

377
00:20:32.313 --> 00:20:34.565
He didn't think of it
as winning $10,000,

378
00:20:34.649 --> 00:20:36.817
he thought of it
as losing $90,000.

379
00:20:37.527 --> 00:20:38.861
So, he upped his bets.

380
00:20:38.945 --> 00:20:40.071
<i>ANNOUNCER: Thelma Schoonmaker.</i>

381
00:20:40.155 --> 00:20:42.282
<i>SCHOONMAKER: Casino,
particularly, is a film that Marty</i>

382
00:20:42.365 --> 00:20:44.575
<i>had thought out very carefully,</i>

383
00:20:44.659 --> 00:20:48.120
<i>all of those montages, and all
his camera moves he had designed</i>

384
00:20:48.204 --> 00:20:52.124
<i>so they would out together. They
were very specific, very extreme,</i>

385
00:20:53.418 --> 00:20:56.421
<i>very hard to do.
But a lot of that,</i>

386
00:20:56.504 --> 00:20:59.840
<i>particularly the opening montages,
were thought out almost like</i>

387
00:20:59.924 --> 00:21:02.343
<i>he did the</i> Raging
Bull <i>fight sequences</i>

388
00:21:02.469 --> 00:21:05.889
<i>so that basically for me it was
a matter of cutting them together</i>

389
00:21:05.972 --> 00:21:08.683
<i>and then just finessing,
a little bit, the cut.</i>

390
00:21:08.808 --> 00:21:11.727
<i>But the structure of them
was already thought out by him.</i>

391
00:21:11.811 --> 00:21:16.106
<i>One example I use sometimes
because it's the easiest to understand</i>

392
00:21:16.191 --> 00:21:19.027
<i>is when he has the
montage where he shows</i>

393
00:21:19.152 --> 00:21:21.487
<i>how everybody is
watching everybody.</i>

394
00:21:22.864 --> 00:21:27.285
<i>And that I really, literally, only
had to cut off the head and the tall,</i>

395
00:21:27.368 --> 00:21:31.622
<i>stick it together and it worked already.
Because he'd already planned out</i>

396
00:21:31.706 --> 00:21:36.043
<i>how he was going to go from the dealer to
the box man and to the pit boss to the...</i>

397
00:21:36.127 --> 00:21:38.254
<i>They were an swish
pans and all I had to do</i>

398
00:21:38.338 --> 00:21:42.091
<i>was cut off the end of it, stick it
together, and it worked beautifully.</i>

399
00:21:42.175 --> 00:21:45.553
<i>So that's really good directing
when you're thinking like that</i>

400
00:21:47.055 --> 00:21:51.392
<i>and imagining a whole sequence
and then carrying it out beautifully.</i>

401
00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.311
<i>ANNOUNCER: Barbara De Fina.</i>

402
00:21:54.395 --> 00:21:56.605
<i>DE FINA: Nick worked
a lot with the real Ace,</i>

403
00:21:56.689 --> 00:21:58.190
<i>I don't know that he ever
actually really came to the set</i>

404
00:21:58.191 --> 00:21:59.901
<i>I don't know that he ever
actually really came to the set</i>

405
00:22:00.068 --> 00:22:03.654
<i>or was close during the filming.</i>

406
00:22:03.738 --> 00:22:06.907
<i>I think it was more in the
script stage and the book stage.</i>

407
00:22:06.991 --> 00:22:10.077
<i>Because, again, this
ultimately was a book</i>

408
00:22:10.161 --> 00:22:11.829
<i>that the movie was based on.</i>

409
00:22:11.913 --> 00:22:15.750
<i>80 Nick did most of his research
and worked with the real Ace.</i>

410
00:22:16.209 --> 00:22:17.919
<i>And the story</i>

411
00:22:18.002 --> 00:22:21.213
<i>I think the highlights
of it are true.</i>

412
00:22:21.422 --> 00:22:24.591
<i>Of course it's hard
sometimes to...</i>

413
00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.846
<i>You need to always have
things happen that are truthful</i>

414
00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:30.348
<i>and that the character might do.</i>

415
00:22:30.431 --> 00:22:33.308
<i>It's hard to sometimes
always stick totally to the truth</i>

416
00:22:33.393 --> 00:22:37.893
<i>because it's just not cinematic and
sometimes it's what happened on Tuesday</i>

417
00:22:38.356 --> 00:22:41.025
<i>but in our movie it's gonna
have to happen on Friday.</i>

418
00:22:41.109 --> 00:22:44.779
<i>And some people will actually be
very offended by that. And upset by it.</i>

419
00:22:44.863 --> 00:22:47.282
<i>It was Nick's job</i>

420
00:22:47.407 --> 00:22:50.618
<i>to make him understand
and to get him to approve.</i>

421
00:22:51.119 --> 00:22:55.456
<i>Because he did read the script
and he did have to approve the script.</i>

422
00:22:55.748 --> 00:22:59.376
<i>Which always makes studios very
nervous and writers very nervous.</i>

423
00:22:59.752 --> 00:23:02.212
<i>But it was sort of
Nick's job to do that.</i>

424
00:23:02.297 --> 00:23:06.467
<i>And he did it. He's a great
writer and a great storyteller.</i>

425
00:23:06.926 --> 00:23:09.720
<i>And I think if the
story felt truthful</i>

426
00:23:09.804 --> 00:23:12.473
<i>and that's what
was important to him.</i>

427
00:23:12.974 --> 00:23:17.311
<i>And I think legally
to simplify it...</i>

428
00:23:17.645 --> 00:23:21.148
<i>A lot of people were dead</i>

429
00:23:21.649 --> 00:23:25.986
<i>which means that there
was no issue getting releases.</i>

430
00:23:26.321 --> 00:23:28.656
<i>Anyone that's been
convicted of a crime</i>

431
00:23:29.449 --> 00:23:32.660
<i>you really don't need to
get a release from them.</i>

432
00:23:32.785 --> 00:23:35.579
<i>So it sort of
narrows down who...</i>

433
00:23:35.663 --> 00:23:37.665
<i>But all the names were changed.</i>

434
00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:41.502
<i>Anybody that's... Like
somebody's wife for example,</i>

435
00:23:41.753 --> 00:23:45.840
<i>we always have to be very careful to
portray them in a way that's respectful</i>

436
00:23:46.007 --> 00:23:50.261
<i>and not to involve them in the crime if
they weren't really involved in the crime.</i>

437
00:23:50.345 --> 00:23:54.265
<i>Or to even suggest that they might
have known what was going on.</i>

438
00:23:55.475 --> 00:23:58.686
<i>But that's what the studio
legal department does</i>

439
00:23:58.811 --> 00:24:01.605
<i>and all the names were
changed for that reason.</i>

440
00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:03.900
<i>ANNOUNCER: Martin Scorsese.</i>

441
00:24:03.983 --> 00:24:07.861
<i>SCORSESE: There's no doubt
about it that it was kind of a sequel</i>

442
00:24:08.863 --> 00:24:10.698
to Goodfellas.

443
00:24:11.199 --> 00:24:15.369
<i>Not a direct sequel but it deals with
that world, but only at a bigger scale.</i>

444
00:24:15.703 --> 00:24:20.203
<i>And it's a film of excess.
A world of excess.</i>

445
00:24:20.875 --> 00:24:23.043
<i>Excess voice over, excess color.</i>

446
00:24:23.336 --> 00:24:24.712
<i>Excess music.</i>

447
00:24:24.796 --> 00:24:27.799
<i>Excess music constantly.
Constant music throughout.</i>

448
00:24:27.882 --> 00:24:29.300
<i>I had a big chart on the wall</i>

449
00:24:29.384 --> 00:24:32.804
<i>of which piece of music I'd use.
Some music I've used before in pictures.</i>

450
00:24:32.887 --> 00:24:36.807
<i>Robbie Robertson helped me. At times
he suggested... Even the music from</i>

451
00:24:36.891 --> 00:24:38.142
Le Mépris, he <i>gave</i> it to me.

452
00:24:38.226 --> 00:24:41.229
<i>I said, "Why not? Why can't we
just take music from Le</i> Mépris?

453
00:24:41.312 --> 00:24:45.774
<i>"Why can't we just take Jimmy Smith doing
Elmer Bernstein's</i> Walk <i>on the</i> Wild Side?"

454
00:24:46.192 --> 00:24:49.528
<i>Because, in sense, this
is a world without limits</i>

455
00:24:50.405 --> 00:24:52.073
<i>in Vegas, there's
these characters.</i>

456
00:24:52.156 --> 00:24:54.825
<i>We can take music, and
this music is part of their world.</i>

457
00:24:54.909 --> 00:24:58.662
<i>They could take it, snatch it, throw
it away, do what they want with it,</i>

458
00:24:58.746 --> 00:25:01.415
<i>consume it, burn it, anything.</i>

459
00:25:01.582 --> 00:25:04.668
<i>And so the wall-to—wall music
was very special, especially</i>

460
00:25:04.752 --> 00:25:07.504
<i>between Le</i> Mépris <i>and
Devo's version of</i> Satisfaction.

461
00:25:07.588 --> 00:25:09.423
<i>That was very interesting.</i>

462
00:25:10.091 --> 00:25:14.053
<i>And with</i> Goodfellas <i>and</i> Casino, <i>I
was playing around with the idea of</i>

463
00:25:15.722 --> 00:25:18.516
<i>movies that are not just</i>

464
00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:23.020
<i>dramatic narrative but also have
documentary aspects to them.</i>

465
00:25:23.438 --> 00:25:25.356
<i>A lot of people do that, but</i>

466
00:25:26.899 --> 00:25:30.444
some <i>people say that it's just a
magazine story, just journalism.</i>

467
00:25:30.528 --> 00:25:32.196
<i>Not necessarily.</i>

468
00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.032
<i>In</i> Goodfellas, <i>Pauline Kael said</i>

469
00:25:35.116 --> 00:25:38.619
<i>that it's</i> Scarf ace <i>without Scarf
ace. I said, "That's the point.</i>

470
00:25:39.287 --> 00:25:40.955
<i>"It's the lifestyle.</i>

471
00:25:41.205 --> 00:25:45.705
<i>"You're gonna now live with these
people. It's not just one, there are many."</i>

472
00:25:45.793 --> 00:25:47.461
<i>And the same thing here.</i>

473
00:25:47.628 --> 00:25:50.130
<i>That was generally the idea</i>

474
00:25:50.381 --> 00:25:53.217
<i>and also to make a
very fast three-hour film.</i>

475
00:25:53.301 --> 00:25:54.302
<i>(CHUCKLES)</i>

476
00:25:54.385 --> 00:25:58.347
<i>We think it's fast. There are some scenes
in the middle where people stop and talk</i>

477
00:25:58.431 --> 00:26:00.850
<i>but other than that, it
seems to be moving a lot.</i>

478
00:26:00.933 --> 00:26:04.102
<i>Nick and I took that
style we developed</i>

479
00:26:04.896 --> 00:26:08.316
in Goodfellas, Wiseguy,
the <i>book</i> he <i>wrote</i>

480
00:26:08.441 --> 00:26:10.401
<i>and took it to
another level here.</i>

481
00:26:10.485 --> 00:26:13.571
<i>And took also the depiction
of the American underworld</i>

482
00:26:13.654 --> 00:26:15.989
<i>to a bigger level, as I said.</i>

483
00:26:16.449 --> 00:26:19.452
<i>And it's based
on riffs, in a way,</i>

484
00:26:19.577 --> 00:26:22.288
<i>a man talking, telling stories,</i>

485
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:24.916
<i>going off on tangents
and digressions.</i>

486
00:26:24.999 --> 00:26:28.252
<i>And how far could you go off
on a digression and still bring it in</i>

487
00:26:28.336 --> 00:26:29.420
<i>back in it.</i>

488
00:26:29.504 --> 00:26:33.674
<i>Cut it to a certain point, fast, and bring
it back into the main line of the narrative.</i>

489
00:26:33.758 --> 00:26:36.594
<i>Some people have agreed
that that happened in the film,</i>

490
00:26:36.677 --> 00:26:40.514
<i>others said that's one of the problems
with the film, that it didn't happen.</i>

491
00:26:40.598 --> 00:26:43.934
<i>That's the nature, the way I
wanted it, the way I am speaking now.</i>

492
00:26:44.018 --> 00:26:46.854
<i>Give you an example, pull it
from here, pull it from there.</i>

493
00:26:46.938 --> 00:26:50.024
<i>Go back on to the narrative
straight, straight line.</i>

494
00:26:50.108 --> 00:26:52.110
SAM: But one thing
I didn't understand...

495
00:26:52.193 --> 00:26:53.444
<i>ANNOUNCER: Barbara De Fina.</i>

496
00:26:53.528 --> 00:26:55.530
<i>DE FINA: Marty
hates the word "act. "</i>

497
00:26:55.613 --> 00:26:59.617
<i>He refused to talk about acts,
and Casino is very sprawling.</i>

498
00:26:59.867 --> 00:27:03.120
<i>Part of it, I think, really had
to do with them not having</i>

499
00:27:03.204 --> 00:27:04.705
<i>a finished book.</i>

500
00:27:04.831 --> 00:27:07.375
<i>And so it sort of developed...</i>

501
00:27:08.709 --> 00:27:10.627
<i>It's not episodic, I think.</i>

502
00:27:10.711 --> 00:27:12.921
<i>You would think it
might become episodic.</i>

503
00:27:13.005 --> 00:27:16.717
<i>I don't feel that it's episodic, but it
does have a very loose structure.</i>

504
00:27:16.801 --> 00:27:19.804
<i>If you think of acts as a
beginning, a middle, and an end,</i>

505
00:27:19.887 --> 00:27:23.307
<i>it has that. Whether they all
start and begin in the right place,</i>

506
00:27:23.391 --> 00:27:24.725
<i>I don't know, but</i>

507
00:27:24.851 --> 00:27:28.813
<i>he and Nick worked really closely
together, they really do write together.</i>

508
00:27:28.896 --> 00:27:31.273
<i>Nick would write pages
and fax them to Marty</i>

509
00:27:31.357 --> 00:27:33.734
<i>and Marty would make
notes and fax them back.</i>

510
00:27:33.818 --> 00:27:36.320
<i>Or sometimes they would
just be in a room together.</i>

511
00:27:36.404 --> 00:27:39.240
<i>They really did write
everything together.</i>

512
00:27:39.407 --> 00:27:40.825
<i>ANNOUNCER: Nicholas Pileggi.</i>

513
00:27:40.908 --> 00:27:44.161
<i>PILEGGI: We'd meet at
the old Drake Hotel, or the...</i>

514
00:27:44.245 --> 00:27:48.415
<i>And we had a suite and I had my
computer, we had a printer there.</i>

515
00:27:48.708 --> 00:27:49.542
<i>We just moved all that stuff in.</i>

516
00:27:49.542 --> 00:27:50.459
<i>We just moved all that stuff in.</i>

517
00:27:50.543 --> 00:27:53.504
<i>It's just two of us, nobody else.
And sometimes Marty's dog.</i>

518
00:27:53.588 --> 00:27:56.090
<i>That was basically it.</i>

519
00:27:56.591 --> 00:27:59.510
<i>I had already outlined
the book to some degree,</i>

520
00:27:59.594 --> 00:28:01.679
<i>Marty had gone over the outline.</i>

521
00:28:01.762 --> 00:28:05.015
<i>And we did this with</i> Goodfellas
<i>as well, Wiseguy, the book.</i>

522
00:28:05.266 --> 00:28:09.766
<i>We try to say, "What is the
narrative storyline, here?"</i>

523
00:28:11.063 --> 00:28:14.524
<i>I'll come up with a version,
and he'll come up with a version</i>

524
00:28:14.609 --> 00:28:17.945
<i>and we kind of move it around
until we have the structure.</i>

525
00:28:18.613 --> 00:28:21.282
<i>I think the structure in</i> Casino

526
00:28:21.616 --> 00:28:24.869
<i>was not my book structure,
it was a movie structure.</i>

527
00:28:25.411 --> 00:28:29.706
<i>And the structure in</i> Casino
<i>was, I would say, 95% Marty's.</i>

528
00:28:30.249 --> 00:28:32.251
<i>He just had a vision.</i>

529
00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.378
<i>ANNOUNCER: Martin Scorsese.</i>

530
00:28:34.462 --> 00:28:37.465
<i>SCORSESE: As one great
filmmaker, whom I love, told me,</i>

531
00:28:37.548 --> 00:28:40.133
<i>he said it's like watching...</i>

532
00:28:40.885 --> 00:28:43.387
<i>Riding a chariot
and six wild horses</i>

533
00:28:43.471 --> 00:28:46.390
<i>always threatening to go out
of control at any given time.</i>

534
00:28:46.474 --> 00:28:49.894
<i>Trying to keep it together
and always living on the edge.</i>

535
00:28:49.977 --> 00:28:52.062
<i>The horses are
gonna just run rampant,</i>

536
00:28:52.146 --> 00:28:55.357
<i>the chariot's gonna go flying,
everything's gonna come crashing down.</i>

537
00:28:55.441 --> 00:28:57.526
<i>And as the film...
That was the idea</i>

538
00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:00.446
<i>of shaping it with many asides</i>

539
00:29:00.738 --> 00:29:03.574
<i>taken through the narrative</i>

540
00:29:03.741 --> 00:29:06.034
<i>by the device of the
use of voice over again</i>

541
00:29:06.118 --> 00:29:09.830
<i>which we developed in a number
of my movies. I like voice over a lot</i>

542
00:29:09.956 --> 00:29:12.500
and Goodfellas has <i>that.</i>

543
00:29:12.792 --> 00:29:14.668
<i>It's like just</i>

544
00:29:15.253 --> 00:29:18.422
<i>a street kid telling a story
on a street corner, in a way.</i>

545
00:29:18.506 --> 00:29:20.341
<i>They are great actors.</i>

546
00:29:20.466 --> 00:29:23.927
<i>Often, your life depends on it,
on the street to be a good actor.</i>

547
00:29:24.011 --> 00:29:28.265
<i>So we just took that idea and
pushed it further to its nth degree</i>

548
00:29:28.349 --> 00:29:31.518
<i>particularly at certain points
when Joe Pesci's character</i>

549
00:29:31.602 --> 00:29:34.271
<i>starts to speak on
the voice over track.</i>

550
00:29:34.355 --> 00:29:38.855
<i>And they seem to argue
or contradict each other.</i>

551
00:29:40.695 --> 00:29:42.113
<i>ANNOUNCER: Nicholas Pileggi.</i>

552
00:29:42.196 --> 00:29:44.531
<i>PILEGGI: The part played
by Frank Vincent is actually</i>

553
00:29:44.615 --> 00:29:48.744
<i>the guy we were using as a technical
adviser, his real name is Frank Cullotta.</i>

554
00:29:48.828 --> 00:29:51.705
<i>He had testified and gone
into the witness program.</i>

555
00:29:51.956 --> 00:29:54.333
<i>I knew him and he had been</i>

556
00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:59.714
<i>really smart and very knowledgeable
and had changed his life.</i>

557
00:30:00.548 --> 00:30:04.468
<i>Frank was the first one who talked,
and I got unbelievable stuff from him.</i>

558
00:30:04.552 --> 00:30:07.972
<i>And also, he was
like that with Nicky.</i>

559
00:30:08.848 --> 00:30:11.559
<i>So I got a lot of
the early Nicky stuff,</i>

560
00:30:11.976 --> 00:30:15.145
<i>what Nicky said here, what
Nicky said there, I got that from</i>

561
00:30:15.229 --> 00:30:17.356
<i>the early Frank stuff.</i>

562
00:30:17.565 --> 00:30:19.692
<i>But then Ace started talking.</i>

563
00:30:20.568 --> 00:30:23.028
<i>And then I wound up</i>

564
00:30:23.237 --> 00:30:27.491
<i>with tape recordings,
long tapes of Nicky talking</i>

565
00:30:27.575 --> 00:30:30.411
<i>FBI stuff that
came out in court.</i>

566
00:30:30.494 --> 00:30:34.247
<i>And people who really knew Nicky
started explaining to me what he said</i>

567
00:30:34.665 --> 00:30:37.250
<i>and when he said it.
So you begin to build...</i>

568
00:30:38.044 --> 00:30:42.544
<i>The original early draft we used,
the voice over was the guy I had.</i>

569
00:30:43.049 --> 00:30:47.549
<i>But as I got more voices, as these
people began to open up a little</i>

570
00:30:49.347 --> 00:30:51.849
<i>then I was able to go to
the different voiceovers.</i>

571
00:30:51.932 --> 00:30:53.433
<i>In the end</i>

572
00:30:53.517 --> 00:30:56.478
<i>we had one voice over, then
we realized we had a couple.</i>

573
00:30:56.562 --> 00:30:59.439
<i>We had used a couple of
voiceovers in</i> Goodfellas.

574
00:30:59.732 --> 00:31:02.776
<i>A lot of people think, "You
can have only one voice over."</i>

575
00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:06.154
<i>But in</i> Goodfellas <i>you have
Henry and you also have his wife.</i>

576
00:31:06.697 --> 00:31:09.783
<i>And because I got
Henry's wife Karen</i>

577
00:31:10.034 --> 00:31:13.620
<i>to tell us everything. She
said, "He gave me the gun</i>

578
00:31:14.622 --> 00:31:18.417
<i>"and it was heavy
and it turned me on."</i>

579
00:31:19.251 --> 00:31:21.878
<i>You can't make that up.
That was Karen, actually.</i>

580
00:31:21.962 --> 00:31:24.714
<i>That was the key
to their relationship.</i>

581
00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:27.885
<i>The fact that he was a gangster
and he had beaten up this guy</i>

582
00:31:27.968 --> 00:31:31.638
<i>who had brutalized her and that he
gave her the gun to put in a milk box.</i>

583
00:31:31.722 --> 00:31:35.058
<i>I could never think that
somebody would give a gun</i>

584
00:31:35.476 --> 00:31:37.895
<i>to a girl from the Five
Towns or Four Towns</i>

585
00:31:37.978 --> 00:31:41.147
<i>and she's gonna put it in a
milk box and get turned on by it.</i>

586
00:31:41.232 --> 00:31:42.691
<i>Who could think that up?</i>

587
00:31:42.775 --> 00:31:45.986
<i>So, that's what the point
is, if you do the journalism</i>

588
00:31:46.153 --> 00:31:49.489
<i>and get these people who are
the subjects of your narrative,</i>

589
00:31:49.782 --> 00:31:52.743
<i>get them to open up and
tell you what's in their hearts</i>

590
00:31:52.827 --> 00:31:55.955
<i>and what they were really
thinking, what turned them on.</i>

591
00:31:57.248 --> 00:32:00.668
<i>How can you not put that
in their voice in the movie?</i>

592
00:32:00.751 --> 00:32:02.502
<i>It's so revealing.</i>

593
00:32:02.586 --> 00:32:06.256
<i>They sometimes tell you these things
and they don't know how legitimate it is.</i>

594
00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:08.925
<i>You're taking notes, you
don't know how revealing it is.</i>

595
00:32:09.009 --> 00:32:12.012
<i>Until you dress it
all in the screenplay</i>

596
00:32:12.096 --> 00:32:13.514
<i>and in the scenes.</i>

597
00:32:13.848 --> 00:32:16.100
<i>The scenes are
all talk and it's all</i>

598
00:32:16.934 --> 00:32:18.852
<i>people revealing themselves.</i>

599
00:32:19.645 --> 00:32:22.606
<i>And I had been
working on the book</i>

600
00:32:22.857 --> 00:32:26.485
<i>but hadn't finished
it. it was only when</i>

601
00:32:26.861 --> 00:32:30.322
<i>we decided to work on the
mood and Marty had a window</i>

602
00:32:30.489 --> 00:32:34.326
<i>that we could work on the movie
and suddenly Bob was interested in it.</i>

603
00:32:34.535 --> 00:32:38.372
<i>That's the thing that made the book
work because that's what opened up</i>

604
00:32:38.456 --> 00:32:42.042
<i>all of these people
who had been distant.</i>

605
00:32:42.334 --> 00:32:45.086
<i>Not at all as forthcoming
as I needed them to be.</i>

606
00:32:45.171 --> 00:32:49.133
<i>I would have probably had to
spend another two years doing it</i>

607
00:32:49.216 --> 00:32:52.886
<i>and I still don't think I would've
gotten what I got in this book.</i>

608
00:32:53.179 --> 00:32:57.224
<i>Whether it's good or bad or what, I
wouldn't have got the access to people</i>

609
00:32:57.308 --> 00:33:00.561
<i>that I got once it was
announced that it was a movie.</i>

610
00:33:00.644 --> 00:33:04.648
<i>And that Bob De Niro
was in the movie. It's idiotic.</i>

611
00:33:04.899 --> 00:33:08.402
<i>Who gets the Pulitzer Prize
for journalism, Bob De Niro</i>

612
00:33:08.486 --> 00:33:10.654
<i>or the writer? I don't
know. It's ludicrous.</i>

613
00:33:10.738 --> 00:33:14.241
<i>But that is where we are
today in society and life.</i>

614
00:33:14.825 --> 00:33:16.743
<i>And the reality was</i>

615
00:33:17.077 --> 00:33:19.079
<i>when the movie was announced</i>

616
00:33:19.163 --> 00:33:22.666
<i>suddenly it became easier
to get information for the book.</i>

617
00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:24.418
<i>Everybody was interested</i>

618
00:33:24.543 --> 00:33:27.337
<i>in meeting Bob, or Marty, or
Sharon Stone. Oh, my God.</i>

619
00:33:27.421 --> 00:33:31.174
<i>And people who would slam doors
on my face and wouldn't talk to me,</i>

620
00:33:31.258 --> 00:33:33.343
<i>hung up, had their
lawyers threaten me,</i>

621
00:33:33.427 --> 00:33:36.263
<i>all of a sudden are calling
me up to meet Bob De Niro,</i>

622
00:33:36.347 --> 00:33:38.766
<i>Sharon Stone, Joe
Pesci, Marty Scorsese.</i>

623
00:33:38.891 --> 00:33:42.185
<i>I'm the writer, I'm there, and
all of a sudden they'd open up</i>

624
00:33:42.269 --> 00:33:46.231
<i>so I immediately started doing all
of the material we had for the book.</i>

625
00:33:46.398 --> 00:33:46.648
<i>Put it into the movie.</i>

626
00:33:46.649 --> 00:33:47.691
<i>Put it into the movie.</i>

627
00:33:47.775 --> 00:33:52.029
<i>The minute I finished working on the
movie, I immediately went back to the book.</i>

628
00:33:52.112 --> 00:33:54.280
<i>I was typing a
minute every minute</i>

629
00:33:54.365 --> 00:33:55.908
<i>and my editor,</i>

630
00:33:56.867 --> 00:33:59.160
<i>Michael Korda was
unbelievably helpful</i>

631
00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:01.246
<i>because he was really murderous.</i>

632
00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:04.207
<i>I tried and had to get the
book out before the movie.</i>

633
00:34:04.291 --> 00:34:07.711
<i>It's hard, you know, they're already
shooting the movie in Las Vegas</i>

634
00:34:07.795 --> 00:34:11.381
<i>when I was still typing
the book in Las Vegas.</i>

635
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:16.262
<i>The publisher wanted the book to
come out a year before the movie.</i>

636
00:34:16.762 --> 00:34:18.722
<i>So they get a nice
ride with the book.</i>

637
00:34:18.806 --> 00:34:22.309
<i>What happens when you bring out a
book at the same time as the movie,</i>

638
00:34:22.393 --> 00:34:25.562
<i>people pay $10 or $20 with your
girlfriend, you go see the movie</i>

639
00:34:25.646 --> 00:34:29.232
<i>Casino, with Bob De Niro and it's written
by the same guy who wrote the book,</i>

640
00:34:29.316 --> 00:34:31.318
<i>why would you spend
$30 for the book?</i>

641
00:34:31.402 --> 00:34:35.197
<i>They already saw that. "What, am I in
the business of giving Pileggi money?"</i>

642
00:34:35.281 --> 00:34:36.699
<i>I go see the movie.</i>

643
00:34:36.782 --> 00:34:40.577
<i>So the publisher is sitting there
with thousands of copies of the book,</i>

644
00:34:40.661 --> 00:34:43.664
<i>they know people are
not gonna duplicate.</i>

645
00:34:43.831 --> 00:34:48.168
<i>The movie sells millions of dollars worth
of tickets and nobody's gonna buy a book.</i>

646
00:34:48.252 --> 00:34:51.463
<i>That's why they'd like you to
read the book first for a year</i>

647
00:34:51.547 --> 00:34:54.675
<i>until it's so bored,
there is not a sale left.</i>

648
00:34:54.758 --> 00:34:57.594
<i>They've wrung
America's pockets dry.</i>

649
00:34:57.678 --> 00:35:01.515
<i>And then the paperback
comes out with the movie.</i>

650
00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:04.059
<i>And you get the second
kick with the paperback.</i>

651
00:35:04.143 --> 00:35:07.563
<i>They have the picture, instead
of just a normal book cover.</i>

652
00:35:07.646 --> 00:35:10.607
<i>Now you have the movie star
on the cover of the paperback.</i>

653
00:35:10.691 --> 00:35:13.777
<i>The lawyers work
all that out in advance</i>

654
00:35:13.902 --> 00:35:15.612
<i>and that helps
sell the paperback.</i>

655
00:35:15.696 --> 00:35:17.155
SAM: ...looking
for weak dealers,

656
00:35:17.239 --> 00:35:19.950
the way lions look
for weak antelope.

657
00:35:23.078 --> 00:35:24.746
Operator, this is Mr. R.

658
00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:26.706
Get me Armstrong

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:28.458
<i>ANNOUNCER: Martin Scorsese.</i>

660
00:35:28.542 --> 00:35:31.836
<i>SCORSESE: It was a very complex film
to make. It took about 100 days to shoot.</i>

661
00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.172
<i>And they were very long days.</i>

662
00:35:34.465 --> 00:35:38.965
<i>Part of the problem was shooting
the first six weeks in the Riviera Hotel</i>

663
00:35:39.803 --> 00:35:43.973
<i>which was all right, we got the
extraordinary atmosphere and flavor</i>

664
00:35:44.058 --> 00:35:48.103
<i>but we weren't important. What was
important for everyone was the gambling.</i>

665
00:35:48.604 --> 00:35:52.149
<i>The first day of shooting I
see an electric sign outside,</i>

666
00:35:52.232 --> 00:35:56.444
<i>"Come and see the shooting of Casino with
Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone, Don Rickles. "</i>

667
00:35:56.528 --> 00:35:59.739
<i>And people would just show up. We
started shooting around 11:00 at night.</i>

668
00:35:59.823 --> 00:36:02.408
<i>And it was murder.
People all over the place.</i>

669
00:36:02.493 --> 00:36:05.746
<i>But around 1:00, 2:00 am, it
started to get quiet. It was great.</i>

670
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:08.998
<i>Then around 6:00 am. you'd
see the older people coming in</i>

671
00:36:09.083 --> 00:36:11.251
<i>that we have
pictures of at the end.</i>

672
00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:13.336
<i>And that sort of thing.</i>

673
00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:15.922
<i>There were two clowns
outside every morning.</i>

674
00:36:16.006 --> 00:36:18.008
<i>It was kind of scary.
They were ladies.</i>

675
00:36:18.092 --> 00:36:21.011
<i>After about the first week, we
became friends. They were great.</i>

676
00:36:21.095 --> 00:36:24.056
<i>They told me how they
went to clown school</i>

677
00:36:24.139 --> 00:36:27.809
<i>and they gave me an application</i>

678
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:31.021
<i>for clown school. I thought
it was really interesting.</i>

679
00:36:31.105 --> 00:36:33.440
<i>They were sweet. Every morning, I
got to say, "Hey! How are you doing?</i>

680
00:36:33.524 --> 00:36:34.525
<i>(LAUGHING)</i>

681
00:36:34.608 --> 00:36:38.028
<i>"The clowns are outside." We
were out of our minds by that point.</i>

682
00:36:38.112 --> 00:36:40.948
<i>You know, it was like
living in that casino.</i>

683
00:36:41.615 --> 00:36:45.285
<i>And the explanations of the
games and that sort of thing.</i>

684
00:36:45.411 --> 00:36:48.956
<i>Of course, the way that that
world is depicted in the film</i>

685
00:36:49.039 --> 00:36:50.790
<i>is now ancient
history, in a way.</i>

686
00:36:50.874 --> 00:36:55.374
<i>The scams are much more complicated
and sophisticated. But in any event</i>

687
00:36:55.963 --> 00:36:59.341
<i>it was a very difficult shoot
because of the different locations</i>

688
00:36:59.425 --> 00:37:02.010
<i>and bits and pieces of
scenes rather than long scenes.</i>

689
00:37:02.094 --> 00:37:06.098
<i>Long scenes were easier to shoot.
Once the actors had it, we were okay.</i>

690
00:37:06.932 --> 00:37:09.601
<i>And then the
violence in the film</i>

691
00:37:10.227 --> 00:37:14.231
comes <i>out of simply, you
know, the enforcing of their will</i>

692
00:37:14.314 --> 00:37:16.065
<i>and making money.</i>

693
00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:19.361
<i>And it's no different
from the rest of the world.</i>

694
00:37:19.903 --> 00:37:24.403
<i>It simply isn't. Especially breaking the
man's hand who was coming in and robbing them.</i>

695
00:37:24.491 --> 00:37:28.161
<i>When we were doing that,
there were two guys who had</i>

696
00:37:28.287 --> 00:37:31.581
<i>held this fellow, the actor,
and they threw him in the room</i>

697
00:37:31.665 --> 00:37:33.249
<i>and there were two real guards.</i>

698
00:37:33.333 --> 00:37:36.252
<i>At one point, we were
halfway through the scene</i>

699
00:37:36.336 --> 00:37:38.504
<i>he mentioned a
few names. He said,</i>

700
00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:42.259
<i>"This guy is getting away lightly."
Because so—and-so, there was a wall,</i>

701
00:37:42.342 --> 00:37:44.761
<i>a special wall in one
place in Vegas, one guy...</i>

702
00:37:44.845 --> 00:37:48.390
<i>There was a wall that they had
that was covered with blood basically.</i>

703
00:37:48.474 --> 00:37:50.267
<i>They said they'd do
what they had to do</i>

704
00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:54.270
<i>and throw him out in the middle of
the road and say he got hit by a car.</i>

705
00:37:54.354 --> 00:37:58.107
<i>That's just normal. That
must have been in the '503.</i>

706
00:37:58.192 --> 00:38:00.444
<i>So if that happens, that
could happen anywhere.</i>

707
00:38:00.527 --> 00:38:04.239
<i>But you had to organize it, figure
out, a guy's coming and making trouble,</i>

708
00:38:04.323 --> 00:38:05.574
<i>he's gotta be dealt with.</i>

709
00:38:05.657 --> 00:38:08.201
<i>And the only way to
do it is with violence.</i>

710
00:38:08.535 --> 00:38:10.161
<i>It's as simple as that.</i>

711
00:38:11.288 --> 00:38:14.791
<i>The Rothstein character, based on
a guy named Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal</i>

712
00:38:14.875 --> 00:38:17.711
<i>was so precise and so guarded</i>

713
00:38:18.295 --> 00:38:21.047
<i>and so cautious in his life.</i>

714
00:38:21.173 --> 00:38:24.426
<i>He dealt with some very tough
people. We don't even get into that.</i>

715
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:27.054
<i>You can't even
get really into...</i>

716
00:38:27.137 --> 00:38:31.015
<i>Every aside that somebody
said, in research or something</i>

717
00:38:31.642 --> 00:38:33.977
<i>that Rosenthal told us or...</i>

718
00:38:34.061 --> 00:38:37.272
<i>You can make three films out
of that alone. You don't know.</i>

719
00:38:37.356 --> 00:38:41.856
<i>This just scratches the surface. He
was very particular and very careful.</i>

720
00:38:42.402 --> 00:38:44.779
If you come back
here, either one of you...

<i>ANNOUNCER: Nicholas Pileggi.</i>

722
00:38:46.406 --> 00:38:50.906
<i>PILEGGI: The only thing he ever did
that was illegal when he was in Illinois</i>

723
00:38:51.495 --> 00:38:55.665
<i>was gamble. He was a bookmaker,
a gambler, and an odds maker.</i>

724
00:38:55.749 --> 00:38:57.125
<i>He did all this stuff, and
gambling is illegal in Illinois.</i>

725

<i>He did all this stuff, and
gambling is illegal in Illinois.</i>

726
00:38:59.545 --> 00:39:02.589
<i>But it is legal in Las
Vegas and Nevada.</i>

727
00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:06.134
<i>So the minute he steps over
the border into the state of Nevada</i>

728
00:39:06.218 --> 00:39:10.430
<i>he is a perfectly legitimate human
being, doing everything he did in Illinois.</i>

729
00:39:10.556 --> 00:39:12.683
<i>But in Nevada, he
is totally legitimate.</i>

730
00:39:12.766 --> 00:39:15.268
<i>And that gave him such freedom</i>

731
00:39:15.394 --> 00:39:19.606
<i>that made him feel so good,
it was a great benefit to him</i>

732

<i>just in his heart.
And that I think</i>

<i>that sense of
freedom and release</i>

734
00:39:27.739 --> 00:39:32.239
<i>was part of the thing that made him think
that he could actually live a normal life</i>

Reed with Robert Young.</i>

787
00:42:31.381 --> 00:42:32.715
<i>This is a working girl.</i>

788
00:42:32.799 --> 00:42:36.844
<i>She's made money. She's making a million
dollars a year with all her boyfriends.</i>

789
00:42:36.928 --> 00:42:39.263
<i>He's got to make
up for that to her.</i>

790
00:42:39.473 --> 00:42:43.973
<i>And so what he is going to do is, he
wants her exclusive to himself basically.</i>

791
00:42:44.728 --> 00:42:49.228
<i>He's gonna say, "Look, whatever you want, you
want a million dollars, I'll give it to you.</i>

792
00:42:49.316 --> 00:42:52.736
<i>"My sense is that once
we begin to live together</i>

793
00:42:52.819 --> 00:42:54.904
<i>"as husband and wife</i>

794
00:42:55.655 --> 00:42:58.741
<i>"and maybe we'll have kids,
and we'll go on with our lives</i>

795
00:42:58.825 --> 00:43:02.745
<i>"we'll fall in love. I'm
already in love, but you aren't.</i>

796
00:43:02.829 --> 00:43:05.998
<i>"But believe me, I'll make
you fall in love with me"</i>

797
00:43:06.083 --> 00:43:08.085
<i>which is probably what he felt.</i>

798
00:43:08.168 --> 00:43:10.920
<i>She's a street girl. But
she's very sophisticated.</i>

799
00:43:11.004 --> 00:43:13.214
<i>I hate to even use
the "street girl" word.</i>

800
00:43:13.298 --> 00:43:17.798
<i>She's a knock around girl and she
knew her way around Las Vegas.</i>

801
00:43:17.969 --> 00:43:21.347
<i>This is an exclusive kind
of person in Las Vegas</i>

802
00:43:21.431 --> 00:43:24.725
<i>who has, by the way, in that
kind of community, all the respect</i>

803
00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:29.147
<i>and the reputation
of legitimate people.</i>

804
00:43:30.315 --> 00:43:32.025
<i>That's who she was.</i>

805
00:43:32.526 --> 00:43:37.026
<i>And in the end, he could never
get her to fall in love with him.</i>

806
00:43:37.155 --> 00:43:39.448
<i>And I think part
of the problem was</i>

807
00:43:39.533 --> 00:43:43.870
<i>she was always in love with the
one guy who she couldn't control</i>

808
00:43:44.121 --> 00:43:46.123
<i>and the one guy who
was really bad to her.</i>

809
00:43:46.206 --> 00:43:49.959
<i>All these other guys gave her money.
This one guy used to take it from her.</i>

810
00:43:50.043 --> 00:43:53.629
<i>And she let him take it. I think we
see that very clearly in the movie.</i>

811
00:43:53.713 --> 00:43:56.966
<i>Of course, there's no one
better for that than Jimmy Woods.</i>

812
00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:59.468
<i>ANNOUNCER: Costume
Designer Rita Ryack.</i>

813
00:43:59.553 --> 00:44:02.973
<i>RYACK: We thought of a little
sort of quasi Jackie Kennedy,</i>

814
00:44:03.056 --> 00:44:05.725
<i>doll-like, Barbie-doll suit,</i>

815
00:44:06.852 --> 00:44:09.646
<i>that's with an
innocent kind of collar.</i>

816
00:44:11.398 --> 00:44:15.402
<i>A little Peter Pan cottar, the suit
is made of white silk matelasse.</i>

817
00:44:15.902 --> 00:44:18.404
<i>And her pumps are
of the same fabric</i>

818
00:44:18.488 --> 00:44:22.575
<i>and I don't think we got a good shoe shot
but they do have little rhinestone heels.</i>

819
00:44:22.659 --> 00:44:25.662
<i>And she had that
little fingertip length veil</i>

820
00:44:25.745 --> 00:44:28.205
<i>and, you know, it is kind of</i>

821
00:44:28.707 --> 00:44:32.001
<i>a loss-of—innocence
costume, although I don't think</i>

822
00:44:32.085 --> 00:44:34.754
<i>there was much
innocence to be lost.</i>

823
00:44:36.923 --> 00:44:38.841
<i>ANNOUNCER: Actor Sharon Stone.</i>

824
00:44:39.009 --> 00:44:43.509
<i>STONE: I was asked to audition
for the role a couple of times</i>

825
00:44:46.099 --> 00:44:50.561
<i>and Marty didn't show
up for the audition.</i>

826
00:44:51.104 --> 00:44:54.941
<i>I forget what happened the
first time that he didn't come.</i>

827
00:44:55.275 --> 00:44:59.195
<i>And then the second time
they said that he was on a train.</i>

828
00:45:00.864 --> 00:45:02.198
-Right?
-Yeah.

829
00:45:02.282 --> 00:45:05.702
<i>The first time that he didn't
show up, I waited and they said,</i>

830
00:45:05.785 --> 00:45:09.538
<i>"It'll be between this hour and this
hour. He'll come and we'll call you."</i>

831
00:45:09.623 --> 00:45:14.123
<i>I was in my car waiting for like, you know,
four hours, and then he just didn't show.</i>

832
00:45:14.753 --> 00:45:16.379
<i>And then the second time</i>

833
00:45:16.463 --> 00:45:19.174
<i>they said he's on an Amtrak
train and he's coming in.</i>

834
00:45:19.257 --> 00:45:22.051
<i>Then they called and said
the Amtrak train broke down.</i>

835
00:45:22.135 --> 00:45:24.470
<i>And I was like, "Yeah, right."</i>

836
00:45:24.554 --> 00:45:27.557
<i>I actually called Amtrak and
said, "Did the train break down?"</i>

837
00:45:27.641 --> 00:45:30.352
<i>They told me that it did
and I still was like, "No.</i>

838
00:45:30.435 --> 00:45:33.396
"He's <i>actually just blowing
me off. " Because I couldn't...</i>

839
00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.816
<i>It was just inconceivable
to me that yet again...</i>

840
00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:39.652
<i>A" I ever wanted was to
be in a Scorsese movie.</i>

841
00:45:39.778 --> 00:45:42.405
<i>A" I ever dreamed about
was to work with De Niro.</i>

842
00:45:42.489 --> 00:45:45.074
<i>This was my biggest
goal in my whole life.</i>

843
00:45:45.158 --> 00:45:49.658
<i>So here I am, twice being blown off
by Scorsese, so I'm like, "Of course."</i>

844
00:45:50.622 --> 00:45:55.001
<i>And so when they called me again and
said would I come and see them, I said no.</i>

845
00:45:56.169 --> 00:45:58.838
<i>Because my heart
couldn't take it.</i>

846
00:45:59.172 --> 00:46:03.634
<i>It was just too traumatic
and heartbreaking for me that</i>

847
00:46:04.344 --> 00:46:06.846
<i>this guy would blow
me off a third time.</i>

848
00:46:06.972 --> 00:46:11.017
<i>So I just went out to
dinner with my best friend.</i>

849
00:46:12.352 --> 00:46:15.271
<i>The agent called me and said,
"He really wants to see you."</i>

850
00:46:15.355 --> 00:46:18.524
<i>I said, "No, he doesn't. He
really wants to blow me off again."</i>

851
00:46:18.608 --> 00:46:22.111
<i>They said, "Can we tell him where
you went to dinner?" I said, "No."</i>

852
00:46:22.195 --> 00:46:25.406
<i>And they called me back later
and said, "Sharon, where are you?"</i>

853
00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:27.283
<i>I was at this
Italian restaurant.</i>

854
00:46:27.367 --> 00:46:29.243
<i>They said, "He really
wants to see you."</i>

855
00:46:29.327 --> 00:46:31.787
<i>And I'm like, "No,
he really doesn't."</i>

856
00:46:31.871 --> 00:46:35.124
<i>And so I am sitting at this
restaurant and having dinner</i>

857
00:46:35.208 --> 00:46:38.794
<i>and I look up and there's Marty</i>

858
00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:41.505
<i>standing at my dinner table.</i>

859
00:46:41.715 --> 00:46:44.884
<i>And I thought I was
gonna have a heart attack.</i>

860
00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:49.510
<i>'Cause it's little me and there
is Marty Scorsese in a white suit</i>

861
00:46:50.724 --> 00:46:53.059
<i>standing at my dinner table.</i>

862
00:46:53.143 --> 00:46:56.396
<i>And he is like, "I really do
wanna see you for this part</i>

863
00:46:56.479 --> 00:46:58.981
<i>"and I really have
seen all your movies."</i>

864
00:46:59.065 --> 00:47:00.483
<i>I'm like, "Yeah, I bet,</i>

865
00:47:00.567 --> 00:47:03.778
<i>"especially</i> King Solomon's Mines
<i>because that was a big winner.”</i>

866
00:47:03.862 --> 00:47:07.740
<i>He's, like, "No, I really did, I
saw that, too." And I'm, like, just...</i>

867
00:47:08.033 --> 00:47:10.076
<i>"This is a nightmare."</i>

868
00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:12.829
<i>He's like, "Can I sit down?"</i>

869
00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:15.748
<i>I was so humiliated.</i>

870
00:47:15.915 --> 00:47:20.085
<i>And he sat down and he
talked to me for, like, an hour</i>

871
00:47:20.211 --> 00:47:22.838
<i>about everything
I had ever done,</i>

872
00:47:22.922 --> 00:47:26.258
<i>the good, the
schmaltz, everything.</i>

873
00:47:26.384 --> 00:47:30.096
<i>And what he thought about
me as an actor and my work</i>

874
00:47:30.764 --> 00:47:34.350
<i>and I thought I just wanted
to get under the table and die</i>

875
00:47:34.434 --> 00:47:37.770
<i>'cause he'd actually come
to the restaurant to talk to me.</i>

876
00:47:38.438 --> 00:47:41.065
<i>And he said, would
I come and audition?</i>

877
00:47:41.149 --> 00:47:44.735
<i>Which I did, and I
went to New York</i>

878
00:47:45.236 --> 00:47:46.695
<i>and I auditioned</i>

879
00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:49.699
<i>and it was a very
peculiar thing to audition</i>

880
00:47:49.783 --> 00:47:53.912
<i>for this part of Ginger
because she is so wild.</i>

881
00:47:54.746 --> 00:47:57.999
<i>And you know, it's
a fine line to tread</i>

882
00:47:58.124 --> 00:48:00.751
<i>because you wanna do the part</i>

883
00:48:00.835 --> 00:48:04.421
<i>but you don't want to
beat the crap out of De Niro</i>

884
00:48:04.506 --> 00:48:08.218
<i>because is he gonna give you the
job if you beat him up in the room?</i>

885
00:48:08.301 --> 00:48:10.011
<i>So I wanted to</i>

886
00:48:12.013 --> 00:48:15.891
<i>demonstrate that I had the
acting prowess to play the part</i>

887
00:48:15.975 --> 00:48:19.144
<i>but I also didn't wanna
damage him in some way</i>

888
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:21.480
<i>where they wouldn't hire me.</i>

889
00:48:23.149 --> 00:48:27.528
<i>So I didn't think I quite did a
great audition because it was...</i>

890
00:48:27.987 --> 00:48:30.489
<i>I kept withholding in the work.</i>

891
00:48:30.782 --> 00:48:34.327
<i>And then I got this call</i>

892
00:48:34.536 --> 00:48:37.038
<i>that Marty and Bob
were coming to California</i>

893
00:48:37.122 --> 00:48:39.666
<i>and they wanted to see me again.</i>

894
00:48:39.833 --> 00:48:42.877
<i>And I went into this hotel room</i>

895
00:48:43.002 --> 00:48:45.629
<i>and they said, "What do
you think of your audition?"</i>

896
00:48:45.713 --> 00:48:48.215
<i>And I said, "I
thought I sucked."</i>

897
00:48:48.341 --> 00:48:50.926
<i>And I said, "Because I
didn't want to beat you up</i>

898
00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:55.180
<i>"and I have to really... To be
Ginger, you have to go berserk."</i>

899
00:48:55.348 --> 00:48:59.643
<i>And they talked to me at length
about would I really let it rip.</i>

900
00:49:00.228 --> 00:49:03.314
<i>And, of course,
that's all I had to hear.</i>

901
00:49:04.482 --> 00:49:05.816
<i>I said I would</i>

902
00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:09.486
<i>and I promised them that
I would be thrilled to do so.</i>

903
00:49:09.571 --> 00:49:12.407
SAM: Trouble was Nicky was
dreaming of his own kind of Vegas.

904
00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:15.784
NICKY: I put money out on the
street charging three points a week.

905
00:49:15.869 --> 00:49:16.995
Juice to the dealers.

906
00:49:17.078 --> 00:49:18.746
Don't make us look for you.

907
00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:20.456
<i>ANNOUNCER: Martin Scorsese.</i>

908
00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:22.583
<i>SCORSESE: A lot of
people love to go to Vegas</i>

909
00:49:22.667 --> 00:49:25.252
<i>because they love the
aesthetic of the bad taste.</i>

910
00:49:25.336 --> 00:49:29.048
<i>I find it a little... I
find it remarkable.</i>

911
00:49:29.382 --> 00:49:33.094
<i>I find it interesting to look at. I
don't like being in places that say,</i>

912
00:49:33.178 --> 00:49:35.263
<i>"Isn't this wonderful
bad taste?"</i>

913
00:49:35.388 --> 00:49:38.516
<i>Where I grew up, I
mean, there was enough</i>

914
00:49:38.766 --> 00:49:40.350
<i>that I saw that was kind of ugly</i>

915
00:49:40.435 --> 00:49:43.104
<i>and at the same time, there
are some wonderful things.</i>

916
00:49:43.188 --> 00:49:47.275
<i>But it was a pretty rough
area, in particular, more ugly</i>

917
00:49:47.775 --> 00:49:51.904
<i>than the skid row area of
old New York, the Bowery.</i>

918
00:49:52.363 --> 00:49:55.532
<i>People at the end of their lives
just thrown away like refuse.</i>

919
00:49:55.617 --> 00:49:58.077
<i>And so, for me,</i>

920
00:49:59.579 --> 00:50:03.207
<i>that bad taste, celebrating
the worst instincts,</i>

921
00:50:03.291 --> 00:50:06.294
<i>I don't know, I
don't go for it, really.</i>

922
00:50:08.922 --> 00:50:12.926
<i>The humor in the piece just
comes from not just the look of it</i>

923
00:50:13.051 --> 00:50:15.428
<i>'cause the look should
be a provocation.</i>

924
00:50:16.095 --> 00:50:20.474
<i>Leopard-skin carpets,
and particularly the clothes,</i>

925
00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:23.352
<i>the costumes that
Ace Rothstein wears.</i>

926
00:50:23.436 --> 00:50:27.481
<i>The houses and that sort of thing.
There's a certain time and place, you know,</i>

927
00:50:27.565 --> 00:50:30.568
<i>when you can look
down on their taste.</i>

928
00:50:30.652 --> 00:50:34.280
<i>I don't look down
or up at it. I just get...</i>

929
00:50:34.447 --> 00:50:37.491
<i>I think it's interesting
visually but I don't enjoy it.</i>

930
00:50:39.285 --> 00:50:42.579
<i>If there's any humor meant
there, it's the humor of excess, also.</i>

931
00:50:42.664 --> 00:50:45.708
<i>How much further can they go
with the style, what they wear,</i>

932
00:50:45.792 --> 00:50:48.336
<i>the style of the houses,
the cars, everything?</i>

933
00:50:48.419 --> 00:50:52.506
<i>But also, the humor of...
The presence of Don Rickles</i>

934
00:50:53.675 --> 00:50:56.844
<i>who understands that world</i>

935
00:50:57.011 --> 00:51:00.723
<i>is part of that world, represents
people that are part of that world</i>

936
00:51:00.807 --> 00:51:03.518
<i>that is so important,
that is the lounge act.</i>

937
00:51:05.311 --> 00:51:08.605
<i>He's not just that. I'm sure he
did that when he was younger.</i>

938
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:11.859
<i>The lounge act
who became friendly</i>

939
00:51:11.985 --> 00:51:15.238
<i>with the gods of the '503,
of that entertainment life,</i>

940
00:51:15.321 --> 00:51:17.948
<i>Sinatra, Dean Martin

943
00:51:26.165 --> 00:51:29.793
<i>He doesn't say... He isn't a jokester.
He doesn't do one line as a joke.</i>

944
00:51:29.877 --> 00:51:31.670
<i>He just starts somehow,</i>

945
00:51:33.131 --> 00:51:36.134
<i>monologues that go on
coming. There's no stopping.</i>

946
00:51:37.385 --> 00:51:40.221
<i>Some of it is pretty tough.</i>

947
00:51:40.388 --> 00:51:43.307
<i>The humor is
tough humor and it's</i>

948
00:51:44.142 --> 00:51:48.642
<i>remarkable in its truth.</i>

949
00:51:49.647 --> 00:51:52.232
<i>Some of it is hard
because it is true.</i>

950
00:51:52.358 --> 00:51:55.194
<i>But it's good to laugh it out.</i>

951
00:51:55.486 --> 00:51:56.862
<i>And he does that.</i>

952
00:51:57.363 --> 00:51:59.365
<i>He's a really remarkable man</i>

953
00:51:59.657 --> 00:52:04.157
<i>and he represents that
attractive side, to me, of that world,</i>

954
00:52:04.871 --> 00:52:07.415
<i>that sort of thing and just
his presence in the film</i>

955
00:52:07.498 --> 00:52:10.709
<i>is very important because
he looks... He's the real thing.</i>

956
00:52:11.502 --> 00:52:15.297
<i>Not a real gangster, I am talking
about the part of the entertainment world</i>

957
00:52:15.381 --> 00:52:18.342
<i>that was owned by, ultimately,</i>

958
00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:21.637
<i>I guess, crime groups in Chicago
and New York, or whatever</i>

959
00:52:21.721 --> 00:52:23.556
<i>who bought those hotels.</i>

960
00:52:24.515 --> 00:52:28.519
<i>But you must remember that all the
people in the crime world down there...</i>

961
00:52:28.686 --> 00:52:29.937
<i>You had...</i>

962
00:52:30.688 --> 00:52:34.608
<i>That's why there's so much time given
to the different deals in the picture.</i>

963
00:52:34.692 --> 00:52:38.362
<i>Different deals and how they bought
these hotels. If you could follow it.</i>

964
00:52:38.446 --> 00:52:42.241
<i>But all you have to know is that
it always has a clean face on it.</i>

965
00:52:42.575 --> 00:52:46.912
<i>It always has a front man that is running
it, it could be the mayor of the town.</i>

966
00:52:47.038 --> 00:52:51.208
<i>Maybe the governor of the state or
maybe the president of the country.</i>

967
00:52:52.126 --> 00:52:54.253
<i>So that's the issue.</i>

968
00:52:55.963 --> 00:53:00.050
<i>That's why I went through all
machinations of trying to explain that.</i>

969
00:53:00.134 --> 00:53:04.138
<i>Even if you don't follow the voice over
of how this hotel wound up there and</i>

970
00:53:04.222 --> 00:53:07.099
who's <i>signing a check,
people shaking hands.</i>

971
00:53:07.225 --> 00:53:09.477
<i>Pictures being
taken. It's just an act</i>

972
00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:12.437
<i>for brig an dry, really,</i>

973
00:53:12.563 --> 00:53:14.356

00:53:19.654 --> 00:53:21.197
<i>ANNOUNCER: Rita Ryack.</i>

978
00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:24.032
<i>RYACK: A lot of people don't
understand that the ”703 and '803</i>

979
00:53:24.117 --> 00:53:26.244
<i>are indeed period movies.</i>

980
00:53:26.327 --> 00:53:30.827
<i>In fact, 1997, that's period.</i>

981
00:53:33.626 --> 00:53:37.129
<i>Here's an off-the-record thing,
I was asked by Production,</i>

982
00:53:37.255 --> 00:53:39.423
<i>"Why does it have
to be so expensive?</i>

983
00:53:39.507 --> 00:53:42.801
<i>"Can't you just go to a thrift
shop and get 703 knockoffs?"</i>

984
00:53:42.885 --> 00:53:45.888
<i>No. We're story-telling.</i>

985
00:53:45.972 --> 00:53:48.933
<i>We had to do a tremendous
amount of research</i>

986
00:53:49.016 --> 00:53:51.476
<i>because there's such
a range of clothing.</i>

987
00:53:51.561 --> 00:53:53.896
<i>And you mentioned
geography, of course.</i>

988
00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:58.317
<i>A" different parts of the
country have very different looks.</i>

989
00:53:59.235 --> 00:54:02.446
<i>Just before this
film, I did</i> Apollo <i>13</i>

990
00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:05.407
<i>which was the same time
period and that was Houston.</i>

991
00:54:05.491 --> 00:54:09.991
<i>And although it was the same time
period, the look was absolutely different.</i>

992
00:54:10.413 --> 00:54:14.041
<i>So, regional differences
are really important.</i>

993
00:54:14.333 --> 00:54:17.919
<i>And of course you have to choose
the clothing that will tell the story</i>

994
00:54:18.004 --> 00:54:19.588
<i>of the film and the characters.</i>

995
00:54:19.672 --> 00:54:23.967
<i>So I went to visit Frank Rosenthal,
who was generous enough</i>

996
00:54:24.051 --> 00:54:26.303
<i>to show us all of
his personal stuff,</i>

997
00:54:26.387 --> 00:54:28.680
<i>his wedding albums.</i>

998
00:54:29.348 --> 00:54:33.769
<i>We took a little tour of his closet
and really became very well acquainted</i>

999
00:54:33.853 --> 00:54:37.606
<i>with his style, and he lent
me few of his own things</i>

1000
00:54:37.857 --> 00:54:39.775
<i>that he had saved
from the period</i>

1001
00:54:39.859 --> 00:54:41.235
<i>from the TV show.</i>

1002
00:54:43.029 --> 00:54:46.198
<i>When we tried them on Bob</i>

1003
00:54:46.616 --> 00:54:49.535
<i>who has his own
physicality and personality,</i>

1004
00:54:51.245 --> 00:54:53.455
<i>the clothing, although
it looked very flashy</i>

1005
00:54:53.539 --> 00:54:57.251
<i>in the context of Frank
Rosenthal's environment</i>

1006
00:54:57.376 --> 00:55:00.629
<i>on Bob, it looked almost Wall
Street, it looked very straight.</i>

1007
00:55:00.713 --> 00:55:04.967
<i>So we built all of his costumes. I
think we built more than 70 suits.</i>

1008
00:55:05.051 --> 00:55:08.095
<i>So, I don't know if all of
them made it into the film.</i>

1009
00:55:08.387 --> 00:55:11.264
<i>But the dark ties that
Frank Rosenthal used</i>

1010
00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:13.141
<i>didn't work on Bob at all.</i>

1011
00:55:13.392 --> 00:55:17.892
<i>One of our most important
meetings was on the roof of the hotel</i>

1012
00:55:18.105 --> 00:55:19.564
<i>where Marty was staying.</i>

1013
00:55:19.649 --> 00:55:23.819
<i>We were up there with bolts of
fabric, a mirror, and the dying light</i>

1014
00:55:23.903 --> 00:55:27.323
<i>at magic hour, draping
Bob with bolts of fabric</i>

1015
00:55:27.406 --> 00:55:31.326
<i>to see what turned
him into Ace Rothstein.</i>

1016
00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:34.079
<i>It was a very
illuminating process.</i>

1017
00:55:34.163 --> 00:55:38.500
<i>I have something else interesting to say
about Ace, it may or may not be interesting.</i>

1018
00:55:38.584 --> 00:55:42.671
<i>The guy who made his
shirts, the shirt maker, Anto,</i>

1019
00:55:42.922 --> 00:55:46.592
<i>actually had made
shirts for Frank Rosenthal.</i>

1020
00:55:47.176 --> 00:55:50.512
<i>This was just a coincidence,
because I always work with Anto</i>

1021
00:55:50.847 --> 00:55:52.849
<i>because he's brilliant.</i>

1022
00:55:53.015 --> 00:55:54.850
<i>But he's done everybody.</i>

1023
00:55:55.101 --> 00:55:58.604
<i>He had Frank Sinatra
shirt patterns, he had</i>

1024
00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:02.107
<i>various wiseguys
I cannot mention.</i>

1025
00:56:02.608 --> 00:56:06.278
<i>But he had Frank Rosenthal's,
so we were actually able</i>

1026
00:56:06.612 --> 00:56:09.990
<i>to tell a little bit of the
story of Frank Rosenthal</i>

1027
00:56:10.449 --> 00:56:12.367
<i>or Ace Rothstein</i>

1028
00:56:13.786 --> 00:56:17.122
<i>through the development
and changes in those collars.</i>

1029
00:56:17.707 --> 00:56:21.168
<i>And the more authenticity
that we can have</i>

1030
00:56:21.711 --> 00:56:24.171
<i>I think the more helpful it is.</i>

1031

<i>that they had from that period.</i>

<i>We invented pieces. They
found pieces in costume houses.</i>

a Pucci jacket.</i>

1048

<i>That was just what I could
wear when I was in my trailer.</i>

1049

go completely out</i>

01:00:05.893 --> 01:00:09.438
<i>I think there is a lot
more humor there.</i>

1101
01:00:10.022 --> 01:00:14.522
<i>I think Joe makes things funnier
and I think Marty lets him go with that.</i>

1102
01:00:15.319 --> 01:00:19.239
<i>I think it is really important because
Joe plays the unsympathetic guys.</i>

he's from the neighborhood.</i>

1106
01:00:29.708 --> 01:00:34.208

and I think Marty lets him go with that.</i>

1107
01:00:35.631 --> 01:00:37.257
<i>I think he knows</i>

1108
01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:40.886
<i>when to listen and when to
let the actors do their thing</i>

1109
01:00:41.095 --> 01:00:44.807

it. I think it makes a great mix.</i>

-This is a motherfucker!

1111

1114
01:00:52.523 --> 01:00:54.942
<i>working with Martin
Scorsese has been</i>

1115
01:00:55.943 --> 01:01:00.443
<i>probably the biggest career
boost any actor could have</i>

1116
01:01:00.948 --> 01:01:05.118
<i>because anything else I do,
that's always made a reference to.</i>

1117

<i>They're always, "He

1118
01:01:09.790 --> 01:01:12.501
<i>It's wonderful to
do a Scorsese film,</i>

1119

1121
01:01:20.885 --> 01:01:22.928

are, or what we think of as bad</i>

<i>or society thinks of as bad.</i>

1127
01:01:37.818 --> 01:01:41.988
<i>They are murderers, they're killers,
and they're brutal and it's a horrible,</i>

1128
01:01:42.072 --> 01:01:46.572
<i>brutal killer life and you can get killed
just as quickly as you can kill somebody.</i>

1129
01:01:47.536 --> 01:01:51.331
<i>But that is their life, they
know that. At the same time,</i>

1130

<i>they are quite

<i>great mommies,</i>

1132
01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:01.216
<i>they're great with their children.
They can be very generous.</i>

1133
01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:04.261
<i>They are human on
a million other levels.</i>

1134
01:02:04.345 --> 01:02:06.096
<i>Except there's this one trigger</i>

1135
01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:09.391
<i>and suddenly you're dealing
with a crocodile or an alligator.</i>

1136
01:02:09.475 --> 01:02:10.851
<i>They'll destroy you.</i>

1137

1144

<i>They just don't.</i>

1145
01:02:35.334 --> 01:02:38.295

<i>If they get a splinter,
they go to the doctor.</i>

1149

<i>VINCENT: When you
meet these people in real life,</i>

1153
01:02:53.686 --> 01:02:57.773
<i>you see that they are
all comedically based.</i>

1154
01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:00.150
<i>I mean, people
don't realize that</i>

1155
01:03:02.027 --> 01:03:05.989
<i>but the comedy of these people
is very, very tragic, but it's there.</i>

1156
01:03:06.323 --> 01:03:08.658
<i>And they use it a lot.</i>

1157
01:03:09.034 --> 01:03:12.454
<i>And they call what we
call "breaking balls" a lot.</i>

1158
01:03:14.081 --> 01:03:17.417
<i>They'll always take a shot at you
and say something funny about you.</i>

1159
01:03:17.501 --> 01:03:20.462
<i>"I don't like those shoes.
Where'd you buy them?"</i>

1160
01:03:20.713 --> 01:03:24.258
<i>Or something about your
hairdo, or your clothes or your...</i>

1161
01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:27.136
<i>Not your wife, not
your children but</i>

1162
01:03:27.219 --> 01:03:29.387
<i>something about you
and they'll always say,</i>

1163
01:03:29.471 --> 01:03:31.681
<i>"Frank, are you still
wearing that shirt again?</i>

1164
01:03:31.765 --> 01:03:33.892
<i>"Take a break,
for Christ's sake."</i>

1165
01:03:34.476 --> 01:03:36.394
<i>And they always have comedies</i>

1166
01:03:36.478 --> 01:03:38.938
<i>'cause when they get
serious, they're serious.</i>

1167
01:03:39.023 --> 01:03:41.817
<i>So everything other
than serious is funny.</i>

1168
01:03:42.026 --> 01:03:43.277
<i>And they go for the laughs.</i>

1169
01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:45.987
<i>They always go
for the humor of it.</i>

1170
01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:49.408
<i>So, Joe and I being
essentially comedians</i>

1171
01:03:49.491 --> 01:03:52.577
<i>and musicians, and entertainers,</i>

1172
01:03:53.454 --> 01:03:57.416
<i>you see that in the characters,
and we had the opportunity to do that.</i>

1173
01:03:57.875 --> 01:04:00.919
<i>And I addressed
them as being people,</i>

1174
01:04:02.963 --> 01:04:06.383
<i>I don't wanna say average
people, but they're just human beings</i>

1175
01:04:06.467 --> 01:04:08.677
<i>and they travel the earth
and do what they do.</i>

1176
01:04:08.761 --> 01:04:10.512
<i>And they're in a business.</i>

1177
01:04:10.846 --> 01:04:14.516
<i>Sometime in their life they
got caught into this lifestyle</i>

1178
01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:18.437
<i>and the attractiveness of it
is what drives them, I guess.</i>

1179
01:04:18.812 --> 01:04:23.107
<i>I don't know what it takes to
pull a trigger and kill somebody.</i>

1180
01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:27.320
<i>That's beyond comprehension
to me. But evidently,</i>

1181
01:04:28.697 --> 01:04:32.367
<i>this lifestyle demands that
kind of action, and they do it.</i>

1182
01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:38.160
<i>To play that, I think you gotta play it
with the utmost honesty you can play it.</i>

1183
01:04:40.084 --> 01:04:42.503
<i>'Cause they're not
fearful when they do it</i>

1184
01:04:42.586 --> 01:04:46.339
<i>so you can't be fearful
as an actor doing it.</i>

1185
01:04:46.673 --> 01:04:49.092
<i>You have to be sincere about it.</i>

1186
01:04:49.927 --> 01:04:51.720
<i>I mean, that's my feelings.</i>

1187
01:04:53.639 --> 01:04:54.723
<i>You just do it.</i>

1188
01:04:54.807 --> 01:04:59.102
<i>I met a lot of people in my life, in
the music business and whatever</i>

1189
01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:01.730
<i>who lived the lifestyle.</i>

1190
01:05:02.022 --> 01:05:05.483
<i>They all seemed to have the
same character going through them</i>

1191
01:05:06.443 --> 01:05:08.736
<i>where they justify their actions</i>

1192
01:05:08.821 --> 01:05:13.033

1196
01:05:23.085 --> 01:05:25.128

01:05:25.212 --> 01:05:28.381
<i>Ace fell in love with Ginger and
she had a boyfriend on the side,</i>

1198
01:05:28.465 --> 01:05:31.509

that she drives her car into his</i>

1199

<i>on their lawn and steps
all over the petunias,</i>

1200
01:05:34.388 --> 01:05:36.807

the violent part.</i>

1201
01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:38.600
<i>And in the violent part,</i>

1202
01:05:39.059 --> 01:05:42.771
<i>Nicky literally put a
guy's head in a vice.</i>

1203
01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:45.440
<i>That's the way they
tried to get this guy to talk.</i>

1204
01:05:45.524 --> 01:05:47.901
<i>They were in a workshop</i>

1205
01:05:48.026 --> 01:05:51.487
<i>and the fastest way to do it was
to put the guy's head in a vice.</i>

1206
01:05:51.572 --> 01:05:52.990
<i>And finally the guy...</i>

1207
01:05:53.073 --> 01:05:55.742
<i>The guy was just a stubborn
man. He would not talk.</i>

1208
01:05:55.826 --> 01:05:59.079
<i>He should've looked at the vice
and given Nicky anything he wanted.</i>

1209
01:05:59.163 --> 01:06:02.916
<i>Nicky didn't want to. "I don't wanna
put your head. Don't make me do this."</i>

1210
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.460
<i>That was what...
"Don't make me do this."</i>

1211
01:06:05.544 --> 01:06:08.380
<i>Can you imagine saying that
to somebody as you put his...</i>

1212
01:06:08.464 --> 01:06:12.468
<i>See, Nicky was blaming
the guy who he's killing</i>

1213
01:06:12.968 --> 01:06:14.678
<i>for forcing him
to force him to...</i>

1214
01:06:14.761 --> 01:06:17.555
<i>That's the kind of
mentality you're dealing with.</i>

1215
01:06:17.639 --> 01:06:19.807
<i>But he did do that and
it's a horrible scene.</i>

1216
01:06:19.892 --> 01:06:21.977
<i>But it actually happened.</i>

1217
01:06:23.187 --> 01:06:27.191
<i>It so identifies the
Nicky character.</i>

1218
01:06:28.108 --> 01:06:31.402
<i>Just by his saying something
like, "Don't make me do this",</i>

1219
01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:33.280
<i>you know who he is.</i>

1220
01:06:33.947 --> 01:06:36.032
<i>And you can't leave
it out. I mean, why?</i>

1221
01:06:36.116 --> 01:06:38.618
<i>Don't make the movie if
you're gonna leave that out.</i>

1222

1224

1235

<i>They have to do terrible things.
Otherwise their head's in the vice.</i>

1236
01:07:19.576 --> 01:07:24.076
<i>That's why you get a guy like
Santoro to question this gentleman</i>

he keeps his mouth shut. It's amazing.</i>

01:08:03.203 --> 01:08:07.703
<i>The guy won't go, so Joe
improvised that angle into the scene.</i>

1255
01:08:08.125 --> 01:08:09.626
<i>It was much better.</i>

1256
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:13.088
<i>We did have a problem with the
eye. We had a prosthetic in the eye</i>

1257
01:08:13.171 --> 01:08:15.798
<i>beginning to pop out.
At our first preview,</i>

1258
01:08:15.966 --> 01:08:19.678
<i>there were too many cuts to this
prosthetic effect that was happening.</i>

1259
01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:22.847
<i>The audience got upset
and I wasn't interested in that.</i>

1260
01:08:24.016 --> 01:08:27.894
<i>I realized that just the thought
of it got people quite upset.</i>

1261
01:08:27.978 --> 01:08:29.396
<i>80, two or three shots...</i>

1262
01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:33.357
<i>It was the first time I worked
with prosthetics, like a horror film.</i>

1263
01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:37.987
<i>I found that I was getting more involved
in the technical aspects of the prosthetic.</i>

1264
01:08:38.071 --> 01:08:40.615
<i>I realized that's not what
it is. It's what Joe is doing.</i>

1265
01:08:40.699 --> 01:08:43.660
<i>And what the young
actor is doing in the vice.</i>

1266
01:08:43.744 --> 01:08:45.871
<i>But it's really
what Joe is doing.</i>

1267
01:08:46.413 --> 01:08:50.875
<i>That horrible aspect of
the humanity he still has</i>

1268
01:08:51.293 --> 01:08:54.004
<i>while still behaving
like an animal, in a way.</i>

1269
01:08:54.504 --> 01:08:56.214
You motherfucker!

1270
01:08:56.673 --> 01:08:58.966
Frankie, do him a fucking favor.

1271
01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:01.469

around that finally...

1272
01:09:01.553 --> 01:09:03.054
<i>ANNOUNCER: Frank Vincent.</i>

1273
01:09:03.138 --> 01:09:05.265
<i>VINCENT: Vegas,
I had been before.</i>

1274
01:09:05.515 --> 01:09:09.727
<i>Only one time before when I visited
all... Joe and I actually went together.</i>

1275
01:09:10.562 --> 01:09:13.356
<i>But I was in Vegas for
four months for this film.</i>

1276
01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:17.940
<i>So we lived in a Marriott residence
and we took our cats with us,</i>

1277
01:09:18.278 --> 01:09:20.863
<i>my wife Kathy and I.</i>

1278
01:09:22.115 --> 01:09:26.615
<i>You play slot machines in the
supermarket, at the car washes.</i>

1279
01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:30.123
<i>I was living a life in Vegas</i>

1280
01:09:30.749 --> 01:09:33.460
<i>and thank God I wasn't
in a hotel or a casino</i>

1281
01:09:33.543 --> 01:09:36.879
<i>but it really made you feel</i>

1282
01:09:37.422 --> 01:09:39.757
<i>what actually
happened by living there.</i>

1283
01:09:40.092 --> 01:09:43.303
<i>And the whole rhythm
and the beat of Vegas,</i>

1284
01:09:43.887 --> 01:09:46.723
<i>I think, came out in everybody.</i>

1285
01:09:46.807 --> 01:09:49.768
<i>There's a very huge
attraction to Vegas. Very huge.</i>

1286
01:09:50.185 --> 01:09:53.521
<i>But I think that most people
go to Vegas and stay a week.</i>

1287
01:09:54.022 --> 01:09:57.692
<i>And they just let it all
out and stay up all night.</i>

1288
01:09:57.776 --> 01:10:00.945
<i>But when you're there
for four months, you...</i>

1289
01:10:01.029 --> 01:10:04.949
<i>We went out here, we went
out there, once or twice a week.</i>

1290
01:10:05.450 --> 01:10:09.162
<i>Plus we were in a casino. We
did a month of nights in the Riviera.</i>

1291
01:10:09.913 --> 01:10:12.457
<i>Nights. We would come
home in the morning</i>

1292
01:10:12.582 --> 01:10:16.586
<i>and put blankets on the
windows to keep the sunlight out.</i>

1293
01:10:16.670 --> 01:10:20.548
<i>'Cause you wake up at 9:00 in the
morning, it's 100 degrees in Vegas.</i>

1294
01:10:20.632 --> 01:10:22.717
<i>And the sun is
blasting. It's the desert.</i>

1295
01:10:22.801 --> 01:10:24.010
<i>Soto sleep...</i>

1296
01:10:24.094 --> 01:10:27.222
<i>And if you only work
two, three days this week</i>

1297
01:10:27.472 --> 01:10:30.725
<i>you still had to stay up,
because you couldn't turn around.</i>

1298
01:10:31.309 --> 01:10:35.062
<i>So we would go visit the
set if we weren't working,</i>

1299
01:10:35.147 --> 01:10:37.190
<i>stay up till 4:00 or
5:00 in the morning</i>

1300
01:10:37.274 --> 01:10:41.774
<i>and we spent a lot of social time together
because we were there for the holidays.</i>

1301
01:10:44.656 --> 01:10:46.658
<i>We have a mutual
friend who lives in Vegas.</i>

1302
01:10:46.742 --> 01:10:50.620
<i>We spent New Year's, we spent
Thanksgiving and Christmas.</i>

1303
01:10:51.163 --> 01:10:54.499
<i>We all got together
and the guitars came out.</i>

1304
01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:56.626
<i>We sang, and ate, and drank.</i>

1305
01:10:56.710 --> 01:10:59.129
<i>So it was really quite
a social event, also.</i>

1306
01:10:59.212 --> 01:11:03.174
<i>We visited a friend, and
he would cook macaroni.</i>

1307
01:11:03.258 --> 01:11:06.928
<i>We'd eat, and drink, and have a good
time because you didn't wanna go out.</i>

1308
01:11:07.012 --> 01:11:09.514
<i>Everybody knew you
and you had no privacy.</i>

1309
01:11:09.598 --> 01:11:13.685
<i>Especially when we were shooting the film
because everybody knew we were in town.</i>

1310
01:11:13.769 --> 01:11:16.313
<i>And it was mayhem.</i>

1311
01:11:16.563 --> 01:11:19.107
<i>So it was a great, great
experience. I loved it.</i>

1312
01:11:19.191 --> 01:11:22.485
<i>I loved shooting the film. I loved
being in Vegas for four months.</i>

1313
01:11:22.569 --> 01:11:24.070
<i>I haven't been back.</i>

1314
01:11:24.154 --> 01:11:27.699
<i>I had been back once,
just to shoot some stuff</i>

1315
01:11:27.783 --> 01:11:29.826
<i>but it was a great experience.</i>

1316

Just a little. That a girl.

1317
01:11:38.627 --> 01:11:40.837
-You wanna go to Mommy?
-Wanna come to Mommy?

1318
01:11:40.921 --> 01:11:42.756
It's all right, sweetheart.

1319
01:11:42.839 --> 01:11:45.883

<i>and was resistant to
anything he tried to impose.</i>

1342
01:12:57.414 --> 01:12:59.457

<i>but it didn't work.</i>

1352
01:13:26.818 --> 01:13:31.318

She was addicted to pills and to alcohol.</i>

get her out of that.</i>

1354

that scene particularly well</i>

<i>the certain unrealized

<i>The drugs, the clothes,</i>

1375

<i>the way that everybody was so
stoned but nobody really thought about it.</i>

1376
01:15:09.087 --> 01:15:11.255
<i>The way people
would sit in a restaurant</i>

<i>and flip over a bread plate

happening in that period.</i>

1380

<i>And just the way that people acted
out in the craziness of that period</i>

1381
01:15:24.728 --> 01:15:28.606
<i>was also captured,

<i>He had, like a 55
degree down angle.</i>

<i>And that look,</i>

1384
01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:42.287
<i>at the three of them in the
booth, and Bob's sort of heaviness</i>

1385

<i>and everybody's behavior,
mixed with the clothes...</i>

1387
01:15:49.419 --> 01:15:53.256
<i>I thought Jimmy captured
this amazing body language</i>

<i>of that guy in that period.
And he had great shoes.</i>

1389
01:15:57.260 --> 01:16:00.805
<i>And there was something
about everybody's body language</i>

1390
01:16:01.306 --> 01:16:03.141
<i>and the dialogue and the...</i>

1391
01:16:03.433 --> 01:16:05.226
<i>We didn't see anybody do drugs</i>

1392
01:16:05.310 --> 01:16:08.438
<i>but you were clear that
everybody was doing drugs.</i>

1393
01:16:09.814 --> 01:16:11.357

1394
01:16:11.441 --> 01:16:15.653
<i>in the particular kind of
lighting, the fluorescent light.</i>

1395
01:16:15.904 --> 01:16:20.158

<i>that everybody was
on in that period.</i>

1397

01:17:24.139 --> 01:17:27.725
<i>I think we did use the
snake as a metaphor</i>

1413
01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:30.144
<i>on all the characters.</i>

1414
01:17:30.895 --> 01:17:35.232
<i>I believe she was wearing a
kind of black chain-mail halter top.</i>

1415
01:17:35.692 --> 01:17:38.194
<i>It was quite revealing,
with a zipper.</i>

1416
01:17:38.361 --> 01:17:40.654
<i>That was a real
piece from the period.</i>

1417
01:17:41.739 --> 01:17:45.576
<i>We had black, very tight
leather pants made for her.</i>

1418
01:17:46.411 --> 01:17:48.746
<i>And that scene
shows a lot of back.</i>

1419
01:17:49.038 --> 01:17:50.330
<i>It was very seductive.</i>

1420
01:17:50.415 --> 01:17:53.334
I never seen him act like
that with anybody else.

1421
01:17:54.252 --> 01:17:57.421
I think he's crazy about
you. He really loves you.

1422
01:17:57.505 --> 01:17:59.256
-He does.
-Come on.

1423
01:17:59.382 --> 01:18:01.509
I went into this
with my eyes open.

1424
01:18:01.593 --> 01:18:03.678
I knew the bottom could
drop out at any time.

1425
01:18:03.761 --> 01:18:07.765
I'm a working girl. You don't think
I'm gonna go into a situation like this

1426
01:18:07.849 --> 01:18:09.934

covered on the back end?

1429

1430
01:18:18.067 --> 01:18:22.567
<i>He championed me, he believed in
me, he supported me through this film.</i>

1434
01:18:40.465 --> 01:18:42.967
<i>He plays such a
scary guy in this movie.</i>

1435
01:18:43.635 --> 01:18:47.388
<i>And I'm telling you, you're
scared when he's in the room.</i>

1436
01:18:47.472 --> 01:18:50.641
<i>It's not like, "Ha, ha, he's
playing that character."</i>

1437
01:18:51.643 --> 01:18:56.143
<i>it's so terrifying to be
in the room with him</i>

1438

<i>He's that guy to such
a degree that it's</i> so...

1441
01:19:10.662 --> 01:19:15.162
<i>It's just so terrifying that
you would do anything,</i>

1442
01:19:16.042 --> 01:19:18.544
<i>anything to make it work.</i>

1443
01:19:20.505 --> 01:19:24.967

1444
01:19:25.051 --> 01:19:28.137

you're in that scene to stay alive.</i>

1445
01:19:28.221 --> 01:19:32.516
<i>It's not like you're in that scene

1446

1458
01:20:18.604 --> 01:20:21.607
County Commissioner Pat
Webb is here to see you.

1459
01:20:22.191 --> 01:20:24.693
-Give me a minute.
-Okay. Just a minute.

1460

<i>ANNOUNCER: Martin Scorsese.</i>

1461
01:20:39.959 --> 01:20:43.754
<i>SCORSESE: The color of the film
and the wide screen was very important.</i>

1462
01:20:43.921 --> 01:20:47.424
<i>The costumes were very important.
We had Ryack do the costumes.</i>

1463
01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:51.553
<i>De Niro's character, Rothstein, is
based on Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal</i>

1464
01:20:51.763 --> 01:20:56.263
<i>whose actual wardrobe was even
more extreme than what we showed.</i>

1465
01:20:57.310 --> 01:20:58.394
<i>Much more.</i>

1466
01:20:59.270 --> 01:21:02.523
<i>Always within suits and ties,
but still, it was very extreme.</i>

1467
01:21:02.607 --> 01:21:06.444
<i>One of my favorites is
the scene in his office</i>

1468
01:21:06.569 --> 01:21:10.364
<i>where he has his pants in the closet
because you don't wanna ruin the crease.</i>

1469
01:21:10.448 --> 01:21:14.948
<i>And why not? I understand it. He
has to give a certain image to people.</i>

1470
01:21:15.161 --> 01:21:18.664
<i>If there's a meeting, then he'd
go, put the pants on, sit properly</i>

1471
01:21:18.748 --> 01:21:23.248
<i>without ruining them, the way I'm ruining
the crease in my pants, and have a meeting.</i>

1472
01:21:23.753 --> 01:21:27.214
<i>His suit, I think, is the
color of aqua-blue or so.</i>

1473
01:21:27.298 --> 01:21:31.468
<i>Who comes in, LQ. Jones,
who is one of my favorite actors.</i>

1474
01:21:31.803 --> 01:21:35.097
<i>He's been in the movies since
the early '50s, Raoul Walsh films</i>

1475
01:21:35.181 --> 01:21:39.143
<i>of course, reached legendary
heights there with Sam Peckinpah.</i>

1476
01:21:39.519 --> 01:21:41.687
<i>He'd often play
with Strother Martin.</i>

1477
01:21:41.771 --> 01:21:43.939
<i>Two extraordinary
people together</i>

1478
01:21:44.023 --> 01:21:45.983
<i>almost to my mind like</i>

1479
01:21:47.610 --> 01:21:50.863
<i>Joe Pesci in a
way, the urban film,</i>

1480
01:21:50.988 --> 01:21:53.824
<i>LQ. Jones is very much
of the West, in a way.</i>

1481
01:21:54.158 --> 01:21:55.409
<i>And so to have</i>

1482
01:21:55.493 --> 01:21:59.371
<i>LQ. Jones and De Niro in the same
frame, I thought was pretty interesting,</i>

1483
01:21:59.455 --> 01:22:00.581
<i>let alone the same scene.</i>

1484
01:22:00.665 --> 01:22:05.165
<i>And also, the scene in the dramatic
structure, on which everything pivots.</i>

1485
01:22:06.504 --> 01:22:10.633
<i>All Ace has to do is say,
"Okay, I'll let the guy stay in here."</i>

1486
01:22:11.217 --> 01:22:15.717
<i>Because LQ. Jones says, "Even if you give
him a spot further on down the trough..."</i>

1487
01:22:16.305 --> 01:22:19.182
<i>Meaning somewhere in
the back just as a token.</i>

1488
01:22:19.684 --> 01:22:22.561
<i>And he said "I can't do
it, he's costing us money."</i>

1489
01:22:22.895 --> 01:22:25.063
<i>It is the element of
pride, the downfall.</i>

1490
01:22:25.148 --> 01:22:29.026
<i>The pride that he could take up
with a woman whom everybody wants.</i>

1491
01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:35.157
<i>She was an extraordinary
woman that everybody loved.</i>

1492
01:22:35.241 --> 01:22:39.741
<i>All the researchers there, all the people,
we're talking old cops and wiseguys</i>

1493
01:22:40.371 --> 01:22:43.207
<i>and gambling denizens
and all these people,</i>

1494
01:22:43.332 --> 01:22:45.250
<i>they always had great
words for this woman.</i>

1495
01:22:45.334 --> 01:22:46.626
<i>They loved her.</i>

1496
01:22:46.752 --> 01:22:48.587
<i>But in his pride, he thought</i>

1497
01:22:48.713 --> 01:22:50.965
<i>that was his flaw, that
he could do anything.</i>

1498
01:22:51.048 --> 01:22:53.175
<i>If she can love him, he could</i>

1499
01:22:53.718 --> 01:22:56.595
<i>be so difficult politically</i>

1500
01:22:56.721 --> 01:22:58.848
<i>with the natives of the area.</i>

1501
01:22:58.931 --> 01:23:01.433
<i>These are new guys
who are just guests here.</i>

1502
01:23:01.517 --> 01:23:04.186
<i>L.Q. Jones told him,
"You're just a guest."</i>

1503
01:23:04.729 --> 01:23:08.941
<i>It's the Chicago power and the
organized crime power against Nevada.</i>

1504
01:23:10.193 --> 01:23:13.070
<i>I don't know, maybe he
stepped too far over the line</i>

1505
01:23:13.196 --> 01:23:17.617
<i>but he couldn't let it go. And that's
a fatal flaw when he doesn't put</i>

1506
01:23:17.742 --> 01:23:19.118
<i>that guy back on the job</i>

1507
01:23:19.202 --> 01:23:23.039
<i>or just something to just placate a
few people around to make things easier</i>

1508
01:23:23.122 --> 01:23:24.164
<i>for everybody.</i>

1509
01:23:24.248 --> 01:23:27.501
<i>No. He's the boss, he's the one
who says who dances at the show,</i>

1510
01:23:27.585 --> 01:23:30.129
<i>he's the one who says
what costumes they wear.</i>

1511
01:23:30.213 --> 01:23:33.299
<i>It becomes pretty
much an old Greek myth</i>

1512
01:23:33.424 --> 01:23:36.635
<i>where they just
collapse based on pride.</i>

1513
01:23:36.761 --> 01:23:40.765
<i>And so costumes were very important
and the element of the cultures,</i>

1514
01:23:40.890 --> 01:23:44.393
<i>the mix of cultures, the wise
guy culture mixed with the West</i>

1515
01:23:44.477 --> 01:23:46.270
<i>was very important.</i>

1516
01:23:49.482 --> 01:23:50.774
<i>Organized crime</i>

1517
01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:55.400
<i>being almost representative of
aspects of the Wild West frontier</i>

1518
01:23:55.613 --> 01:23:57.156
<i>in a way.</i>

1519
01:23:57.281 --> 01:24:01.781
<i>In my mind, the closing of the old Las Vegas
was like the end of the frontier, in a sense.</i>

1520
01:24:03.788 --> 01:24:06.916
For my ulcer, I take
a half of one of these.

1521
01:24:07.083 --> 01:24:09.126
That's when I have extreme pain.

1522
01:24:09.252 --> 01:24:12.546
I had a three-month supply.
What did you do with them?

1523
01:24:12.630 --> 01:24:15.007
You didn't have to beat him up.

1524
01:24:15.132 --> 01:24:16.299
What?

1525
01:24:17.093 --> 01:24:19.470
I was just trying to help him.

1526
01:24:20.596 --> 01:24:22.806
Like I'm sleeping with the guy.

1527
01:24:22.932 --> 01:24:24.767
Yeah, how do I know?

1528
01:24:25.351 --> 01:24:28.562
You can't make me

1529
01:24:28.646 --> 01:24:30.939
-What?
-I said,

01:35:35.979 --> 01:35:39.315
<i>SCHOONMAKER: It was the first
time that I had ever used digital editing</i>

1722
01:35:39.441 --> 01:35:43.778
<i>and I had a wonderful assistant
who trained me, named Scott Brock</i>

1723
01:35:44.154 --> 01:35:46.364
<i>and he really taught
me how to do it.</i>

1724
01:35:46.490 --> 01:35:49.618
<i>But it took a little bit of time
before I was comfortable with it.</i>

1725
01:35:49.701 --> 01:35:52.161
<i>But then I kicked in,
and I was off and running</i>

1726
01:35:52.287 --> 01:35:55.498
<i>and I did find it was very
useful for experimentation</i>

1727
01:35:55.624 --> 01:35:59.461
<i>that I would think nothing
of ripping into a scene</i>

1728
01:35:59.544 --> 01:36:01.462
<i>and trying another
version of it.</i>

1729
01:36:01.546 --> 01:36:05.174
<i>I would just make a copy of my
edit. And that freed me up a lot.</i>

1730
01:36:05.384 --> 01:36:09.679
<i>It was very interesting how
that freed up experimentation.</i>

1731
01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:13.516
<i>Also, the fact that we could run
many more tracks was very helpful</i>

1732
01:36:13.642 --> 01:36:16.811
<i>because of the complex
music texture of the movie.</i>

1733
01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:21.520
<i>So previously, when I'd been working
with three sound heads at the most,</i>

1734
01:36:22.192 --> 01:36:26.692
<i>now I could have up
to 8, or 10, or 16 tracks.</i>

1735
01:36:28.198 --> 01:36:32.493
<i>I wonder if the music would have
been as easy to interweave and create</i>

1736
01:36:33.704 --> 01:36:38.204
<i>such a dense, complex texture without
it. I don't think it would have happened.</i>

1737
01:36:39.001 --> 01:36:43.501
<i>We started mixing for
ourselves, for our own screenings.</i>

1738
01:36:43.672 --> 01:36:47.050
<i>We started mixing in the Lightworks,
which was also a new experience for me.</i>

1739
01:36:47.175 --> 01:36:51.137
<i>We used to go somewhere and
spend a lot of money in a sound facility</i>

1740
01:36:51.221 --> 01:36:52.639
<i>mixing very few tracks together.</i>

1741
01:36:52.723 --> 01:36:55.851
<i>Now we were mixing an
incredible number of them.</i>

1742
01:36:55.934 --> 01:36:58.853
<i>That was the beginning of a
different way of doing things</i>

1743
01:36:58.937 --> 01:37:01.648
<i>which we've gone on. It's
gotten more complicated now</i>

1744
01:37:01.732 --> 01:37:04.568
<i>so that our mixes are actually
taking much longer to do</i>

1745
01:37:04.693 --> 01:37:07.904
<i>because we have so many
more tracks that we can mix.</i>

1746
01:37:08.113 --> 01:37:10.406
She came to me.

1747
01:37:11.074 --> 01:37:14.911
<i>But Marty just loves to score
his own movies. He always has.</i>

1748
01:37:16.246 --> 01:37:18.915
<i>And he's done it
in different ways.</i>

1749
01:37:19.416 --> 01:37:23.628
Mean Streets, <i>of course, is one
of the first great uses of rock 'n roll</i>

1750
01:37:23.754 --> 01:37:25.589
<i>in film scoring.</i>

1751
01:37:26.923 --> 01:37:30.968
<i>And</i> Raging <i>Bull was more subdued,
because it was of a different time</i>

1752
01:37:31.094 --> 01:37:35.594
<i>when music was coming through
tenement windows and from small radios.</i>

1753
01:37:36.475 --> 01:37:40.437
<i>Goodfellas, the music became
very up-front, because we had stereos</i>

1754
01:37:40.562 --> 01:37:43.606
<i>and everybody had great
sound systems in their cars.</i>

1755
01:37:44.232 --> 01:37:48.319
<i>So by the time we get to Casino,
music is just omnipresent in the culture.</i>

1756
01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:54.280
<i>Marty just loves
creating a tapestry</i>

1757
01:37:54.785 --> 01:37:58.079
<i>that underlies the whole movie
with songs that he has heard</i>

1758
01:37:58.163 --> 01:37:59.873
<i>that he feels are appropriate.</i>

1759
01:37:59.956 --> 01:38:04.456
<i>Particularly, there's a Rolling Stones
song that is used under a montage</i>

1760
01:38:04.544 --> 01:38:07.713
<i>and we worked so long on that.
I remember making music cuts.</i>

1761
01:38:07.798 --> 01:38:10.926
<i>It was very hard, making
the music cuts on that film</i>

1762
01:38:11.593 --> 01:38:15.972
<i>because we were doing them all
ourselves, and that was difficult.</i>

1763
01:38:17.391 --> 01:38:20.977
<i>So there's something kind of</i>

1764
01:38:21.645 --> 01:38:25.148
<i>very up—front and brash
about a lot of the music</i>

1765
01:38:25.232 --> 01:38:27.484
<i>which fits very
well with Las Vegas.</i>

1766
01:38:27.651 --> 01:38:28.735
<i>ANNOUNCER: Rita Ryack.</i>

1767
01:38:28.819 --> 01:38:31.655
<i>RYACK: Those collars were
years in development for me.</i>

1768
01:38:31.822 --> 01:38:32.823
<i>(LAUGHS)</i>

1769
01:38:35.492 --> 01:38:37.577
<i>I started figuring
out those collars</i>

1770
01:38:37.661 --> 01:38:40.914
<i>because there are very few
prototypes that really exist.</i>

1771
01:38:40.997 --> 01:38:44.917
<i>When I</i> was <i>doing</i> A Bronx
Tale and Mad Dog and Glory,

1772
01:38:45.001 --> 01:38:48.754
<i>I did a lot of shopping in New
York and the Lower East Side</i>

1773
01:38:48.839 --> 01:38:52.092
<i>and the places that those guys
had actually bought their clothes.</i>

1774
01:38:52.175 --> 01:38:56.262
<i>And it was very hard
to find any extant stuff.</i>

1775
01:38:57.139 --> 01:39:01.351
<i>So a lot of that was just,
kind of, adjusting and adjusting</i>

1776
01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:03.645
<i>until everybody was satisfied.</i>

1777
01:39:04.354 --> 01:39:07.690
<i>I have to tell you, I don't
know if they're exactly real.</i>

1778
01:39:07.816 --> 01:39:11.778
<i>What do we call them? The
Lock collar, the Dime Round Point.</i>

1779
01:39:13.697 --> 01:39:16.783
<i>You can't really put a
knot, there's no tie space.</i>

1780
01:39:17.701 --> 01:39:20.787
<i>Man, those collars
just went on forever.</i>

1781
01:39:22.122 --> 01:39:25.875
<i>Again, you hit on
certain images that are...</i>

1782
01:39:26.668 --> 01:39:30.129
<i>it's intuitive, and you
can feel it when they work.</i>

1783
01:39:30.464 --> 01:39:31.548
<i>ANNOUNCER: Frank Vincent.</i>

1784
01:39:31.631 --> 01:39:34.300
<i>VINCENT: It was thrilling to
wear the clothes of the period</i>

1785
01:39:34.384 --> 01:39:36.803
<i>because, like I said, I
grew up in that period</i>

1786
01:39:36.887 --> 01:39:39.222
<i>and it brought back
a lot of memories.</i>

1787
01:39:39.806 --> 01:39:43.142
<i>And Rita was wonderful. in fact,</i>

1788
01:39:43.894 --> 01:39:46.479
<i>I think we baby-sat
for her cat once.</i>

1789
01:39:46.688 --> 01:39:49.399
<i>She had to do something. I
think she had to leave town</i>

1790
01:39:49.524 --> 01:39:51.734
<i>and my wife and I
baby-sat for Rita's cat.</i>

1791
01:39:51.818 --> 01:39:53.569
<i>But it was really...</i>

1792
01:39:53.695 --> 01:39:56.072
<i>You put the clothes on,
you felt like the character.</i>

1793
01:39:56.198 --> 01:40:00.410
<i>I put sideburns on, they dyed
my hair for the time changes.</i>

1794
01:40:02.245 --> 01:40:04.914
<i>Sometimes the costume
does the work for you.</i>

1795
01:40:06.082 --> 01:40:08.000
NICKY: I got the latest
anti-bugging equipment

1796
01:40:08.084 --> 01:40:10.503
from the same places
that sell to the CIA.

1797
01:40:10.587 --> 01:40:15.087
I had all the special police frequency radios,
FBI de-scramblers, night-vision cameras...

1798
01:40:16.426 --> 01:40:20.926
So, the miserable sons of bitches never
caught me doing anything I couldn't handle.

1799
01:40:21.932 --> 01:40:25.435
SAM: I got my job on the line, and
he's out having the time of his life.

1800
01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:26.686
<i>ANNOUNCER: Rita Ryack.</i>

1801
01:40:26.770 --> 01:40:30.356
<i>RYACK: Putting Bob in
pink was just so delicious.</i>

1802
01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:34.902
<i>He's in a pink sweater in the
scene where he's talking to the guys</i>

1803
01:40:37.113 --> 01:40:41.033
<i>and the helicopters are going
overhead over the golf course</i>

1804
01:40:41.117 --> 01:40:43.786
<i>watching Joe Pesci play golf.</i>

1805
01:40:44.371 --> 01:40:47.707
<i>Bob is in a pink bouclé
golf sweater there.</i>

1806
01:40:47.791 --> 01:40:52.291
<i>Again, who else could wear
that pink sweater and pink slacks?</i>

1807
01:40:52.796 --> 01:40:55.548
<i>He probably even had
pink shoes, I'm sure he did.</i>

1808
01:40:55.632 --> 01:40:58.968
<i>Then you have to choose the
clothing that will tell the story</i>

1809
01:40:59.094 --> 01:41:01.221
<i>of the film and the characters.</i>

1810
01:41:01.513 --> 01:41:05.725
<i>It was usually the morning
ritual of the watch and the ring.</i>

1811
01:41:05.976 --> 01:41:08.144
<i>Kind of a papal
ritual, wasn't it?</i>

1812
01:41:08.311 --> 01:41:12.811
<i>Every morning we'd meet in Bob's
trailer to look at the outfit for the scene</i>

1813
01:41:13.233 --> 01:41:15.318
<i>and decide.</i>

1814
01:41:15.485 --> 01:41:19.238
<i>We had a box of rings
and watches. And decide</i>

1815
01:41:19.322 --> 01:41:23.159
<i>which was the most
appropriate set for the day.</i>

1816
01:41:24.452 --> 01:41:28.952
<i>I guess each watch and ring,
as every costume, necktie,</i>

1817
01:41:29.416 --> 01:41:31.584
<i>add a certain semiotic value.</i>

1818
01:41:31.668 --> 01:41:33.753
<i>There would be some
discussion in the morning.</i>

1819
01:41:33.837 --> 01:41:37.340
<i>Should it coordinate with the
outfit, and what is it we want to say?</i>

1820
01:41:37.465 --> 01:41:40.301
<i>How much are we gonna
see the hand and the wrist?</i>

1821
01:41:40.510 --> 01:41:43.012
<i>And we'd make the choice.</i>

1822
01:41:45.432 --> 01:41:48.184
$100, whoever hits the plane.

1823
01:41:50.353 --> 01:41:54.774
SAM: If things weren't bad enough, in
comes Piscano, the Kansas City underboss.

1824
01:41:54.858 --> 01:41:57.610
He ran the grocery
store in Kansas City...

1825
01:41:57.694 --> 01:41:59.028
<i>ANNOUNCER: Thelma Schoonmaker.</i>

1826
01:41:59.154 --> 01:42:03.616
<i>SCHOONMAKER: Katie Scorsese, Marty's
mother, was a great addition to the film.</i>

1827
01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:07.203
<i>And as usual, as
in</i> King <i>of</i> Comedy

1828
01:42:08.204 --> 01:42:12.208
<i>and his other films, sometimes
he just puts her into a scene,</i>

1829
01:42:12.292 --> 01:42:15.795
<i>doesn't really tell her much what
it's about, and just says to her,</i>

1830
01:42:15.879 --> 01:42:19.632
<i>"Just react to it, " as he did in
Goodfellas with the famous scene</i>

1831
01:42:19.716 --> 01:42:21.551
<i>where she's
cooking food for them</i>

1832
01:42:21.676 --> 01:42:23.886
<i>when they have a corpse
in the trunk of the car.</i>

1833
01:42:23.970 --> 01:42:27.306
<i>Here he had Vinny
Vella, a wonderful actor</i>

1834
01:42:27.390 --> 01:42:31.143
<i>who was ranting, and
using a lot of swear words.</i>

1835
01:42:31.227 --> 01:42:35.727
<i>Katie was naturally upset by the
use of swearing. She didn't like it.</i>

1836
01:42:37.192 --> 01:42:41.571
<i>So he just said to her, "Just react
to him." And the way she does it,</i>

1837
01:42:41.696 --> 01:42:45.825
<i>you couldn't write such a thing,
you couldn't dream up such a thing.</i>

1838
01:42:45.909 --> 01:42:49.913
<i>It's so natural. And the wonderful
thing in the outtakes is that</i>

1839
01:42:50.246 --> 01:42:53.499
<i>Marty, when he was directing
her, would say, "Okay, Mom,</i>

1840
01:42:53.583 --> 01:42:57.753
<i>"just react again to him when he
says that bad word." And she said,</i>

1841
01:42:57.837 --> 01:43:01.757
<i>"I am. I keep doing it
and he keeps saying it."</i>

1842
01:43:02.425 --> 01:43:06.595
<i>She really was in the scene, in
other words. She was living in it.</i>

1843
01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:11.101
<i>She didn't think of herself as an actress,
and that the actor she was working with</i>

1844
01:43:11.184 --> 01:43:14.103
<i>was doing lines or anything.</i>

1845
01:43:14.187 --> 01:43:18.687
<i>For her, she was really reacting to
him. And so it was a great deal of fun</i>

1846
01:43:19.067 --> 01:43:23.567
<i>to pick the moments of
her despair with this guy.</i>

1847
01:43:25.281 --> 01:43:29.285
<i>There were so many of them. We
had to narrow it down to the best ones.</i>

1848
01:43:29.953 --> 01:43:34.453
<i>But I just loved working on that
sequence. And then again, later on</i>

1849
01:43:34.874 --> 01:43:39.374
<i>he said to her, "Just make sure you
react to him when he says the 'F' word."</i>

1850
01:43:39.754 --> 01:43:42.882
<i>And she said,
"Marty, my virgin ears!"</i>

1851
01:43:43.425 --> 01:43:45.718
<i>(LAUGHING)</i>

1852
01:43:46.302 --> 01:43:48.971
<i>She was just a
natural, she's perfect.</i>

1853

<i>ANNOUNCER: Barbara De Fina.</i>

1854
01:43:51.141 --> 01:43:53.476
<i>DE FINA: Length
is always an issue.</i>

1855
01:43:53.768 --> 01:43:57.104
<i>The one big issue. If you
get past a certain length</i>

1856
01:43:57.480 --> 01:43:59.982
<i>the exhibitor loses a show.</i>

1857
01:44:00.984 --> 01:44:02.485
<i>Soto deliver a movie...</i>

1858
01:44:02.610 --> 01:44:04.945
<i>I can't remember
exactly what the number is</i>

1859
01:44:05.155 --> 01:44:07.157
<i>but the exhibitors
get very upset.</i>

1860
01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:11.740
<i>Because instead of having three or
four shows a night, they'll have two.</i>

1861
01:44:12.912 --> 01:44:17.166
<i>And that's a major problem
for a lot of exhibitors.</i>

1862
01:44:17.834 --> 01:44:20.461
<i>So that there's
always the extreme...</i>

1863
01:44:22.130 --> 01:44:23.923
<i>So that length is
always an issue.</i>

1864
01:44:24.007 --> 01:44:27.677
<i>And the studios also
like to have a movie</i>

1865
01:44:27.969 --> 01:44:30.513
<i>that they feel is
the right length...</i>

1866
01:44:31.181 --> 01:44:33.433
<i>We wanna have a movie that...</i>

1867
01:44:33.933 --> 01:44:37.436
<i>It doesn't matter how long it
is. You can't feel that it's long.</i>

1868
01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:41.190
<i>If a movie feels long, even if
it's two hours and 10 minutes,</i>

1869
01:44:41.357 --> 01:44:42.775
<i>then it really is too long.</i>

1870
01:44:42.859 --> 01:44:46.696
<i>But another movie can be
two-and-a-half hours, and it'll play fine.</i>

1871
01:44:47.322 --> 01:44:49.365

issue with length.</i>

1872

<i>And I'd be like, "What
are you looking for, Marty?"</i>

<i>And he'd say, "I'm just
looking for all the elements."</i>

<i>And I would sit and
watch and watch</i>

2186
02:03:33.655 --> 02:03:36.616
<i>So I could pretend that
I was interested in him</i>

2187
02:03:36.700 --> 02:03:40.161
<i>and it wasn't my fault
that she was torturing him.</i>

2188
02:03:41.163 --> 02:03:43.415
<i>So I got her to bug him</i>

2189
02:03:43.665 --> 02:03:47.043
<i>to create that
friction in the room.</i>

2190
02:03:47.377 --> 02:03:51.005
<i>And Marty doesn't cut
for physical continuity.</i>

2191
02:03:51.423 --> 02:03:54.342
<i>He cuts his films for
emotional continuity.</i>

2192
02:03:55.427 --> 02:03:58.596
<i>What a gift to a bunch
of us, the hoodlums.</i>

2193
02:03:59.389 --> 02:04:03.434
<i>Because we don't
have to follow that kind of</i>

2194
02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:09.065
<i>structure with Marty.</i>

2195
02:04:09.191 --> 02:04:12.402
<i>And when you
start to get square,</i>

2196
02:04:12.527 --> 02:04:15.530
<i>Marty will stop the show,</i>

2197
02:04:15.948 --> 02:04:19.201
come <i>up to you and tell
you</i> some <i>story about his life.</i>

2198
02:04:19.785 --> 02:04:21.286
<i>Some kooky story.</i>

2199
02:04:21.703 --> 02:04:25.081
<i>Like, he Will say, "I did this."</i>

2200
02:04:25.874 --> 02:04:30.211
<i>And he will tell you some
crazy story about his life.</i>

2201
02:04:31.630 --> 02:04:34.549
<i>And in the beginning
when he did it, I thought...</i>

2202
02:04:35.884 --> 02:04:39.220
<i>And then you see
he's trying to say,</i>

2203
02:04:39.888 --> 02:04:42.932
<i>"Man, I've been
there, We seen it,</i>

2204
02:04:43.392 --> 02:04:46.937
<i>"there's nothing you can say
or do that is going to scare me.</i>

2205
02:04:47.270 --> 02:04:48.729
<i>"Listen up."</i>

2206
02:04:48.939 --> 02:04:50.941
<i>And no matter where you are...</i>

2207
02:04:51.233 --> 02:04:52.734
<i>There was a scene</i>

2208
02:04:53.944 --> 02:04:57.322
<i>where we quickly were
trying to get scenes where...</i>

2209
02:04:57.406 --> 02:05:01.535
<i>And there is a scene where
I am kneeling by a little,</i>

2210
02:05:01.618 --> 02:05:03.953
<i>like a tufted,</i>

2211
02:05:04.621 --> 02:05:08.416
<i>like a settee cushion
in the bedroom.</i>

2212
02:05:08.834 --> 02:05:11.753
<i>And I'm kneeling, and I'm crying</i>

2213
02:05:11.837 --> 02:05:14.297
<i>and Bob's yelling
at me or something.</i>

2214
02:05:15.340 --> 02:05:18.092
<i>And I'm trying to
express this thing</i>

2215
02:05:18.176 --> 02:05:22.221
<i>and I went up to Marty before the
take and I wanted to tell him something.</i>

2216
02:05:22.305 --> 02:05:26.559
<i>I was so upset and disturbed with
the scene that I couldn't really talk.</i>

2217
02:05:26.643 --> 02:05:29.771
<i>(WHIMPERING) I
was, like, "Marty, I just..."</i>

2218
02:05:32.441 --> 02:05:35.110
<i>And he just looks at me
and he goes, "I know."</i>

2219
02:05:36.278 --> 02:05:39.281
<i>And I'm sobbing
and I couldn't speak.</i>

2220
02:05:39.865 --> 02:05:43.118
<i>I so needed to get this
thing through to him, I'm like...</i>

2221
02:05:43.201 --> 02:05:46.454
<i>(BABBLING)</i>

2222
02:05:46.538 --> 02:05:49.249
<i>And he just grabbed
me. He's like, "I know.</i>

2223
02:05:49.791 --> 02:05:51.918
<i>"Yeah, I got it.</i>

2224
02:05:52.461 --> 02:05:54.963
<i>"I get you." And he just like...</i>

2225
02:05:55.297 --> 02:05:59.718
<i>And he did get whatever
the hell I was trying to...</i>

2226
02:05:59.801 --> 02:06:02.637
<i>"I got you. That's it. Right."</i>

2227
02:06:03.346 --> 02:06:06.640
<i>And he really made
that contact with me,</i>

2228
02:06:07.476 --> 02:06:10.103
<i>got it. [couldn't
have said,</i> "Boo.”

2229
02:06:10.937 --> 02:06:13.147
<i>I went back, I did my scene.</i>

2230
02:06:13.356 --> 02:06:17.526
<i>Whatever the hell was going
on with me, he'll hang with you.</i>

2231
02:06:17.652 --> 02:06:21.113
<i>I was in a phone
booth at one point</i>

2232
02:06:21.823 --> 02:06:24.325
<i>having this kook
conversation with Bob.</i>

2233
02:06:25.118 --> 02:06:27.829
<i>And I just said, "Marty, I
can't have you over there.</i>

2234
02:06:27.954 --> 02:06:30.289
<i>"I need you where
I can touch you.</i>

2235
02:06:30.373 --> 02:06:32.166
<i>"I'm really scared."</i>

2236
02:06:32.709 --> 02:06:35.002
<i>Marty sat on the dirt</i>

2237
02:06:35.504 --> 02:06:38.006
<i>by my feet outside
the phone booth</i>

2238
02:06:38.715 --> 02:06:42.385
<i>so that I could
go to crazyville.</i>

2239
02:06:42.803 --> 02:06:45.639
<i>But so that I could
see him and touch him</i>

2240
02:06:46.640 --> 02:06:48.058
<i>because he knew...</i>

2241
02:06:48.850 --> 02:06:52.979
<i>I just said, "I'm going somewhere far
away, I need to make sure I can get back."</i>

2242
02:06:53.063 --> 02:06:55.356
<i>He's like, "I'll get
you back, babe."</i>

2243
02:06:56.066 --> 02:07:00.028
<i>Whatever it takes, he
isn't scared of this thing.</i>

2244
02:07:00.570 --> 02:07:03.531
<i>And so many directors
are just scared.</i>

2245
02:07:04.074 --> 02:07:06.659
<i>They're scared that
if you, as a woman</i>

2246
02:07:07.035 --> 02:07:09.704
<i>go big, or go wide, or go deep,</i>

2247
02:07:10.497 --> 02:07:13.416
<i>first of all, you're
gonna roll over the guys</i>

2248
02:07:13.667 --> 02:07:17.629
<i>and second of an... I don't
know, it's like that expression,</i>

2249
02:07:17.712 --> 02:07:21.549
<i>"If one woman told the truth, the
whole world would crack open."</i>

2250
02:07:21.675 --> 02:07:23.551
<i>Well, Marty wants your truth.</i>

2251
02:07:24.928 --> 02:07:26.554
SAM: The good part
was I had Amy back.

2252
02:07:26.680 --> 02:07:27.847
<i>ANNOUNCER: Barbara De Fina.</i>

2253
02:07:27.931 --> 02:07:30.016
<i>DE FINA: Bob's good with script.</i>

2254
02:07:30.892 --> 02:07:34.896
<i>He's really so intuitive about
characters, especially characters that</i>

2255
02:07:35.522 --> 02:07:37.273
<i>could be very unsympathetic.</i>

2256
02:07:37.566 --> 02:07:38.775
<i>ANNOUNCER: Nicholas Pileggi.</i>

2257
02:07:38.900 --> 02:07:40.359
<i>PILEGGI: The original
version we wrote</i>

2258
02:07:40.443 --> 02:07:42.862
<i>he asked her about so
much money and that was it.</i>

2259
02:07:42.946 --> 02:07:44.530
<i>Bob said, "No.</i>

2260
02:07:45.198 --> 02:07:48.242
"He's <i>not going to just
ask her once or twice.</i>

2261
02:07:48.535 --> 02:07:50.954
<i>"He's going to stay
after her. He'll say,</i>

2262
02:07:51.079 --> 02:07:54.248
<i>—"'What'd you do with the money?'
-'I gave him $3,000 for a watch.'</i>

2263
02:07:54.374 --> 02:07:57.543
<i>“$3,000. Okay, that
leaves you $47,000.</i>

2264
02:07:57.627 --> 02:07:59.962
<i>-"'What happened to the rest?'
-'Well, I got...”...</i>

2265
02:08:00.088 --> 02:08:04.050
<i>So it was Bob's insight
into the character</i>

2266
02:08:04.134 --> 02:08:06.845
<i>that this is an accountant,
this is a gambler,</i>

2267
02:08:06.928 --> 02:08:09.597
<i>this is a guy who knew
the odds to everything.</i>

2268
02:08:10.056 --> 02:08:12.266
<i>He was an odds
maker, he set the odds.</i>

2269
02:08:12.392 --> 02:08:16.892
<i>He set the odds for all the football
games played on Sunday for the mob.</i>

2270
02:08:17.272 --> 02:08:18.982
<i>He set the odds for the country.</i>

2271
02:08:19.107 --> 02:08:23.111
<i>He's not going to let somebody
get away with $40,000 this way. No.</i>

2272
02:08:23.612 --> 02:08:27.073
<i>80 Bob just kept after
Marty and me in the room.</i>

2273
02:08:27.407 --> 02:08:30.201
<i>"No, then he's going to
say this." So we gave him...</i>

2274
02:08:30.285 --> 02:08:32.662
<i>Then he'd say,
"$6,000 for a suit?</i>

2275
02:08:32.787 --> 02:08:36.665
<i>"I've never spent $6,000 for a suit.
How many suits can a guy buy, three?"</i>

2276
02:08:36.791 --> 02:08:41.253
<i>And he would keep after
it, and he just exhausted us.</i>

2277
02:08:41.963 --> 02:08:44.632
<i>But that's exactly what
he does in that scene.</i>

2278
02:08:44.966 --> 02:08:47.760
<i>He really loves her, he
doesn't want to chase her away</i>

2279
02:08:47.844 --> 02:08:50.513
<i>but he is compelled
to be one way.</i>

2280
02:08:51.139 --> 02:08:53.850
<i>He is programmed,
it's in his DNA</i>

2281
02:08:53.975 --> 02:08:57.019
<i>to get it down to
the last five cents.</i>

2282
02:08:57.270 --> 02:08:59.272
<i>And it drives everybody nuts</i>

2283
02:08:59.356 --> 02:09:02.233
<i>and chases away the
one person he really loves.</i>

2284
02:09:02.317 --> 02:09:03.735
<i>It's just fascinating.</i>

2285
02:09:03.818 --> 02:09:07.863
<i>But Bob spotted it, and
made the scene much deeper.</i>

2286
02:09:08.448 --> 02:09:09.657
<i>ANNOUNCER: Sharon Stone.</i>

2287
02:09:09.783 --> 02:09:14.283
<i>STONE: I think the interesting thing
about the Ginger-Ace relationship was that</i>

2288
02:09:18.166 --> 02:09:20.001
<i>she was so</i>

2289
02:09:21.169 --> 02:09:25.669
<i>in love with the idea that someone
like Ace could be interested in her.</i>

2290
02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:30.845
<i>That someone big and important</i>

2291
02:09:31.680 --> 02:09:33.682
<i>would notice her.</i>

2292
02:09:35.016 --> 02:09:38.144
<i>It made her feel
big and important.</i>

2293
02:09:38.895 --> 02:09:43.395
<i>And then I think when he stopped
really paying attention to her,</i>

2294
02:09:44.025 --> 02:09:47.069
<i>she thought that if she acted
like she was big and important</i>

2295
02:09:47.195 --> 02:09:49.363
<i>he would pay attention to her.</i>

2296
02:09:49.864 --> 02:09:53.200
<i>She didn't ever have a
comprehension of love.</i>

2297
02:09:53.910 --> 02:09:56.704
<i>And, of course, he didn't
have a comprehension of love.</i>

2298
02:09:56.830 --> 02:10:01.251
<i>So they never really had a real
coming together in any healthful way.</i>

2299
02:10:01.710 --> 02:10:04.045
<i>They just had this strange,</i>

2300
02:10:05.505 --> 02:10:09.550
<i>broken ego-dynamic where they
kept trying to get each other's attention.</i>

2301
02:10:10.218 --> 02:10:13.512
<i>And when these two broken egos</i>

2302
02:10:13.596 --> 02:10:15.723
<i>started clashing</i>

2303
02:10:18.685 --> 02:10:22.772
<i>and fighting to get each other's
attention from their incredibly</i>

2304
02:10:24.065 --> 02:10:25.858
<i>needy places...</i>

2305
02:10:28.069 --> 02:10:29.987
<i>You know, Bob and
I had the best time.</i>

2306
02:10:30.071 --> 02:10:32.990
<i>We thought it was
hilarious when we fought.</i>

2307
02:10:33.074 --> 02:10:37.574
<i>We would fight to the
death, but the crew was</i>

2308
02:10:38.455 --> 02:10:39.497
<i>(LAUGHS)</i>

2309
02:10:39.581 --> 02:10:40.915
<i>horrified.</i>

2310
02:10:41.374 --> 02:10:45.252
<i>Marty would let a whole
mag roll out on camera</i>

2311
02:10:45.754 --> 02:10:48.339
<i>and just let us
go, let us improv</i>

2312
02:10:48.506 --> 02:10:51.842
<i>and we'd just go
for it tooth and nail.</i>

2313
02:10:51.926 --> 02:10:54.094
<i>We'd have these fights,</i>

2314
02:10:54.679 --> 02:10:58.015
<i>verbal, that were just wow</i>

2315
02:10:58.099 --> 02:11:01.685
<i>because we could go.
And physical to the point</i>

2316
02:11:01.770 --> 02:11:04.856
<i>where sometimes he'd drag
me down those hallways.</i>

2317
02:11:04.939 --> 02:11:08.359
<i>That house had marble
hallways, and my legs would just be</i>

2318
02:11:08.443 --> 02:11:12.280
<i>black and blue and green,
because we were just,</i>

2319
02:11:12.781 --> 02:11:14.699
<i>you know, really fighting.</i>

2320
02:11:15.241 --> 02:11:18.702
<i>And the camera would roll
out and you'd hear the film go...</i>

2321
02:11:18.787 --> 02:11:19.871
<i>(MIMICS FILM SPILLING
FROM CAMERA)</i>

2322
02:11:19.954 --> 02:11:24.041
<i>And Marty would go, "And that's a
cut." And you could hear a pin drop.</i>

2323
02:11:26.086 --> 02:11:28.880
<i>Then Bob and I would
start screaming with laughter</i>

2324
02:11:28.963 --> 02:11:32.591
<i>and still no one... People
would be so horrified.</i>

2325
02:11:33.093 --> 02:11:37.593
<i>But you don't very
often get to go like that.</i>

2326
02:11:40.809 --> 02:11:43.812
<i>Ginger was a really
interesting character</i>

2327
02:11:44.145 --> 02:11:47.481
<i>because, of course, on the
surface, Ginger was a person</i>

2328
02:11:47.607 --> 02:11:49.942
<i>that just slides and "see you."</i>

2329
02:11:50.610 --> 02:11:53.988
<i>And we talked a lot about how</i>

2330
02:11:54.906 --> 02:11:59.160
<i>it's not the fact that she starts
out and she slides into her demise</i>

2331
02:11:59.953 --> 02:12:01.829
<i>that is what's
interesting about Ginger.</i>

2332
02:12:01.913 --> 02:12:06.413
<i>What's interesting is though,
apparently, that's what she's doing...</i>

2333
02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:10.838
<i>But the playing of Ginger
is that you don't play that.</i>

2334
02:12:11.339 --> 02:12:15.839
<i>You play that she thinks she's
winning the whole time she's doing it</i>

2335
02:12:16.010 --> 02:12:19.013
<i>and that's what makes
Ginger so happening.</i>

2336
02:12:19.472 --> 02:12:22.516
<i>And that's what I really
got when I read her.</i>

2337
02:12:22.851 --> 02:12:25.854
<i>But no, to play her,
you have to play like,</i>

2338
02:12:25.937 --> 02:12:27.939
<i>what's her hook every time?</i>

2339
02:12:28.189 --> 02:12:31.650
<i>How is she going to
find a new way to win</i>

2340
02:12:31.860 --> 02:12:33.987
<i>in every losing situation?</i>

2341
02:12:34.863 --> 02:12:36.197
<i>ANNOUNCER: Barbara De Fina.</i>

2342
02:12:36.322 --> 02:12:38.115
<i>DE FINA: The movie works
on many different levels</i>

2343
02:12:38.199 --> 02:12:41.452
<i>so that different people can
relate to it in different ways.</i>

2344
02:12:41.536 --> 02:12:44.372
<i>I think Sharon's story
and the love story</i>

2345
02:12:44.497 --> 02:12:46.207
<i>is a kind of
fractured love story</i>

2346
02:12:46.291 --> 02:12:49.210
<i>but, in a way, very
glamorous and believable</i>

2347
02:12:50.462 --> 02:12:52.297
<i>and has a reality to it.</i>

2348
02:12:53.631 --> 02:12:56.800
<i>I think the American
public, especially,</i>

2349
02:12:57.051 --> 02:13:01.551
<i>I guess it was in the '70s, and even
when we made the movie in the '903</i>

2350
02:13:03.141 --> 02:13:06.894
<i>we were all obsessed with money</i>

2351
02:13:07.020 --> 02:13:09.022
<i>and I think Vegas works on...</i>

2352
02:13:09.189 --> 02:13:11.357
<i>Everybody still wants to go win.</i>

2353
02:13:12.484 --> 02:13:15.904
<i>"Something for
nothing" is a big theme.</i>

2354
02:13:16.029 --> 02:13:20.158
<i>Everybody wants to go to Vegas
and put a quarter in a machine and win.</i>

2355
02:13:20.241 --> 02:13:22.409
<i>So I think that's a theme</i>

2356
02:13:22.660 --> 02:13:25.746
<i>that at the end
you see is empty.</i>

2357
02:13:26.498 --> 02:13:30.251
<i>And I think it works on the
level of it's just incredibly visual:</i>

2358
02:13:30.585 --> 02:13:32.920
<i>all the clothes,
the photography,</i>

2359
02:13:33.046 --> 02:13:36.340
<i>the world, the slot machines,
and the lights, I mean, it's just...</i>

2360
02:13:36.424 --> 02:13:40.719
<i>You can just watch the
movie as a roller coaster ride.</i>

2361
02:13:42.514 --> 02:13:43.681
<i>ANNOUNCER: Rita Ryack.</i>

2362
02:13:43.765 --> 02:13:46.225
<i>RYACK: She cuts
her hair and she goes...</i>

2363
02:13:46.434 --> 02:13:48.853
<i>Now this is again pretty subtle</i>

2364
02:13:49.020 --> 02:13:52.732
<i>but she goes from a
triangular silhouette</i>

2365
02:13:54.901 --> 02:13:57.778
<i>to a reverse, an inverted
triangular silhouette</i>

2366
02:13:57.904 --> 02:13:59.947
<i>with stronger shoulders.</i>

2367
02:14:00.615 --> 02:14:02.950
<i>She's declaring her independence</i>

2368
02:14:03.034 --> 02:14:06.746
<i>she goes off with Lester, and
she comes back with a boob job</i>

2369
02:14:07.622 --> 02:14:10.958
<i>and a new strong, we call it
her I-am-woman silhouette.</i>

2370
02:14:11.376 --> 02:14:12.877
<i>And she's cut her hair</i>

2371
02:14:12.961 --> 02:14:17.461
<i>and her clothing is much harder
and stronger from that point.</i>

2372
02:14:19.300 --> 02:14:20.467
<i>ANNOUNCER: Sharon Stone.</i>

2373
02:14:20.593 --> 02:14:24.555
<i>STONE: There is no one more
exquisite to work for than Scorsese.</i>

2374
02:14:24.639 --> 02:14:27.141
<i>It just doesn't happen</i>

2375
02:14:27.976 --> 02:14:29.894
<i>because not only
will he give you</i>

2376
02:14:29.978 --> 02:14:33.564
<i>every bit of every research
that you could possibly ask for.</i>

2377
02:14:34.065 --> 02:14:36.942
<i>And I'm a research animal.</i>

2378
02:14:37.569 --> 02:14:40.321
<i>He gave me photos,</i>

2379
02:14:41.990 --> 02:14:43.992
<i>everything, pictures,</i>

2380
02:14:45.493 --> 02:14:47.953
<i>anything I wanted
that was available.</i>

2381
02:14:48.288 --> 02:14:52.788
<i>To me, it was a
treasure trove of goods</i>

2382
02:14:56.337 --> 02:14:58.505
<i>on this woman
that I was playing.</i>

2383
02:14:59.465 --> 02:15:03.677
<i>And it was enervating
and exciting and scary.</i>

2384
02:15:04.470 --> 02:15:07.431
<i>But once I began to play her,</i>

2385
02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:10.810
<i>people came out of the woodwork.</i>

2386
02:15:11.019 --> 02:15:15.064
<i>And people started calling
me and saying, "I knew her."</i>

2387
02:15:15.982 --> 02:15:18.150
<i>And I would get calls</i>

2388
02:15:18.818 --> 02:15:21.111
<i>that were real up—front,</i>

2389
02:15:21.195 --> 02:15:24.907
<i>"I'd like to meet you, take you to
lunch," and I was friends with her.</i>

2390
02:15:24.991 --> 02:15:27.576
<i>And other calls that were very</i>

2391
02:15:29.037 --> 02:15:31.414
<i>low—down, you know.</i>

2392
02:15:31.956 --> 02:15:35.084
<i>"I'll meet you on the
corner, and I'll tell you</i>

2393
02:15:36.085 --> 02:15:37.795
<i>"and you never saw me."</i>

2394
02:15:38.254 --> 02:15:40.756
<i>And people would lay some really</i>

2395
02:15:41.507 --> 02:15:44.510
<i>serious information on me or:</i>

2396
02:15:46.179 --> 02:15:48.681
<i>"I'm just going to tell
you these two things."</i>

2397
02:15:48.765 --> 02:15:52.059
<i>And they wouldn't tell me
who they were or what it was.</i>

2398
02:15:52.143 --> 02:15:54.478
<i>Or, "I'm gonna give you this."</i>

2399
02:15:55.146 --> 02:15:59.233
<i>Or would just walk up
to me and say,</i> "Boom.”

2400
02:15:59.942 --> 02:16:03.028
<i>And some of the information
that I got was just invaluable.</i>

2401
02:16:04.697 --> 02:16:09.197
<i>And there were just a
couple of two little pieces</i>

2402
02:16:10.370 --> 02:16:13.873
<i>that just turned
it for me on her.</i>

2403
02:16:15.667 --> 02:16:19.087
<i>And some things that
were so the heart of her</i>

2404
02:16:19.629 --> 02:16:21.797
<i>and some things
that were so tender</i>

2405
02:16:22.215 --> 02:16:25.801
<i>that I got to know her.</i>

2406
02:16:27.637 --> 02:16:31.015
<i>And eventually, when
you play someone like that,</i>

2407
02:16:31.557 --> 02:16:34.851
<i>you carry them really
near and dear to you</i>

2408
02:16:35.228 --> 02:16:39.190
<i>and some of the contacts
and relationships that I had</i>

2409
02:16:39.273 --> 02:16:41.984
<i>became sacred to me</i>

2410
02:16:42.443 --> 02:16:45.571
<i>and will always be sacred to me.</i>

2411
02:16:46.030 --> 02:16:48.240
<i>I felt, at a point</i>

2412
02:16:48.700 --> 02:16:51.577
<i>like I carried her in me.</i>

2413
02:16:52.453 --> 02:16:53.829
<i>ANNOUNCER: Nicholas Pileggi.</i>

2414
02:16:53.955 --> 02:16:56.499
<i>PILEGGI: Ginger getting
so angry at her husband</i>

2415
02:16:57.542 --> 02:17:01.420
<i>for all this other stuff, and getting
stoned and getting smashed.</i>

2416
02:17:01.879 --> 02:17:04.631
<i>And so she then starts
coming on to Nicky.</i>

2417
02:17:04.757 --> 02:17:08.427
<i>Nicky, because
he's so angry at Ace</i>

2418
02:17:08.761 --> 02:17:12.264
<i>is gonna screw his wife just to
get even at Ace. I don't know.</i>

2419
02:17:12.348 --> 02:17:16.435
<i>That was not a passionate relationship.
That was a get-even relationship.</i>

2420
02:17:16.519 --> 02:17:19.772
<i>At that point in Nicky's career,</i>

2421
02:17:19.856 --> 02:17:23.693
<i>I think Nicky would have loved to
put a bullet right through Ace's head.</i>

2422
02:17:23.776 --> 02:17:26.653
<i>He got so angry at him.
Nicky was that volatile.</i>

2423
02:17:26.738 --> 02:17:30.032
<i>He could've been sorry in
the morning, he'd never tell you.</i>

2424
02:17:30.116 --> 02:17:33.661
<i>But he was so angry.
So the next best thing</i>

2425
02:17:33.911 --> 02:17:36.788
<i>to killing a guy
is to cuckold him</i>

2426
02:17:37.248 --> 02:17:40.042
<i>in Nicky's world. So
that's what Nicky does.</i>

2427
02:17:40.668 --> 02:17:42.670
<i>(LAUGHING) She
is also angry at Ace</i>

2428
02:17:42.754 --> 02:17:47.254
<i>and the best thing she can do
is betray Ace with his best friend.</i>

2429
02:17:48.217 --> 02:17:51.720
<i>So how do you walk away
from a soap opera like that?</i>

2430
02:17:51.804 --> 02:17:54.973
<i>We should have shown this movie
at 9:00 in the morning on soaps.</i>

2431
02:17:55.057 --> 02:17:57.184
<i>It's classic stuff.</i>

2432
02:17:58.311 --> 02:17:59.478
<i>ANNOUNCER: Frank Vincent.</i>

2433
02:17:59.562 --> 02:18:03.274
<i>VINCENT: The first time I saw it, I
said, "I'm not sure about this film."</i>

2434
02:18:04.525 --> 02:18:08.278
<i>Then when I saw it one or two
more times, I became sure of it</i>

2435
02:18:08.529 --> 02:18:11.823
<i>because it's a lot to
see on a one-time basis.</i>

2436
02:18:12.366 --> 02:18:16.244
<i>And I see a lot of people now that
tell me how much they love</i> Casino.

2437
02:18:16.329 --> 02:18:19.206
<i>And it happens with
all of Marty's films.</i>

2438
02:18:19.373 --> 02:18:21.625
<i>It always has a
delayed effect on people.</i>

2439
02:18:21.709 --> 02:18:25.879
<i>I see people who know
every word of the films.</i>

2440
02:18:26.964 --> 02:18:30.634
<i>So there is a delayed
effect on all of Marty's films</i>

2441
02:18:30.718 --> 02:18:34.680
<i>because I don't think you can watch
any one of these three films one time</i>

2442
02:18:34.764 --> 02:18:36.432
<i>and get it.</i>

2443
02:18:36.516 --> 02:18:39.060
<i>Because there is so much to see</i>

2444
02:18:39.143 --> 02:18:42.771
<i>that people watch it, they have it
on their machines, they come home...</i>

2445
02:18:42.855 --> 02:18:47.355
<i>One guy told he just walked in the
house, he puts it on and watches</i> Casino

2446
02:18:48.319 --> 02:18:51.572
<i>over and over and little
nuances that he picks up.</i>

2447
02:18:51.656 --> 02:18:55.785
<i>And he watches</i> Raging Bull
<i>over and over and</i> Goodfellas.

2448
02:18:55.868 --> 02:18:58.662
<i>So my initial reaction
was, "Wait a minute.</i>

2449
02:18:59.163 --> 02:19:03.663
<i>"It's long and it has a lot of characters
in it. There's a big story in it."</i>

2450
02:19:05.086 --> 02:19:07.671
<i>So it took me a time or two</i>

2451
02:19:08.214 --> 02:19:10.549
<i>to really get it.</i>

2452
02:19:11.175 --> 02:19:12.551
<i>ANNOUNCER: Martin Scorsese.</i>

2453
02:19:12.677 --> 02:19:14.595
<i>SCORSESE: This was a very</i>

2454
02:19:15.388 --> 02:19:19.888
<i>relaxed way of working that we
have between Joe and Bob De Niro.</i>

2455
02:19:20.268 --> 02:19:22.520
<i>And then Sharon
was brought into that.</i>

2456
02:19:22.603 --> 02:19:25.272
<i>It was a long process
working with her</i>

2457
02:19:26.107 --> 02:19:29.443
<i>and meeting and auditioning
with her. She agreed to an audition.</i>

2458
02:19:29.527 --> 02:19:32.071
<i>We auditioned a bunch
of other terrific ladies.</i>

2459
02:19:32.154 --> 02:19:34.990
<i>But she really seemed
to have something special,</i>

2460
02:19:35.074 --> 02:19:36.700
<i>particularly with that character</i>

2461
02:19:36.784 --> 02:19:39.119
<i>and she was ready to
push through as an actress</i>

2462
02:19:39.203 --> 02:19:42.581
<i>and go further than
what she had done before.</i>

2463
02:19:42.748 --> 02:19:46.710
<i>And the real generosity
there was between</i>

2464
02:19:46.794 --> 02:19:49.922
<i>De Niro helping
her in the scenes,</i>

2465
02:19:50.381 --> 02:19:52.007
<i>being there for her.</i>

2466
02:19:52.466 --> 02:19:54.509
<i>That was very important.</i>

2467
02:19:55.052 --> 02:19:58.096
<i>Helping her and
being patient with her.</i>

2468
02:19:58.431 --> 02:19:59.974
<i>This was very important.</i>

2469
02:20:00.057 --> 02:20:03.351
<i>And Pesci, for the most part, he
only has a few scenes with her.</i>

2470
02:20:03.436 --> 02:20:07.690
<i>But Bob has many scenes with
her, so we'd lay it all out very carefully</i>

2471
02:20:08.065 --> 02:20:12.069
<i>so that she felt comfortable in
some scenes, particularly where</i>

2472
02:20:12.695 --> 02:20:16.532
<i>it's revealed that she's been
having an affair with Nicky.</i>

2473
02:20:16.616 --> 02:20:18.242
<i>She's in the bedroom, crying</i>

2474
02:20:18.326 --> 02:20:20.703
<i>and he says, "Do you
realize what could happen?"</i>

2475
02:20:20.786 --> 02:20:24.456
<i>In that scene, it was so quiet
in the place, we just simply</i>

2476
02:20:24.957 --> 02:20:27.459
<i>made her feel okay
and comfortable.</i>

2477
02:20:27.668 --> 02:20:29.878
<i>She was slowly</i>

2478
02:20:30.838 --> 02:20:32.714
<i>somehow becoming this...</i>

2479
02:20:33.633 --> 02:20:36.385
<i>Becoming the emotion,
just lying there on the ground.</i>

2480
02:20:36.469 --> 02:20:38.095
<i>Then we just
turned the camera on</i>

2481
02:20:38.179 --> 02:20:40.389
<i>without her knowing
and he kept talking to her.</i>

2482
02:20:40.473 --> 02:20:44.973
<i>So I had to be very careful. She
was really something in that scene.</i>

2483
02:20:45.937 --> 02:20:48.022
<i>She felt very...</i>

2484
02:20:48.189 --> 02:20:51.692
<i>I remember, just to do the death
scene, she was waiting during the lighting,</i>

2485
02:20:51.776 --> 02:20:53.944
<i>she'd come and sit next
to me and hold my hand.</i>

2486
02:20:54.028 --> 02:20:57.614
<i>You have to go through the experience
because that's how the woman died</i>

2487
02:20:57.698 --> 02:21:00.701
<i>in some hall of some
motel in LA, you know.</i>

2488
02:21:03.496 --> 02:21:05.581
<i>She took on, she understood</i>

2489
02:21:09.543 --> 02:21:13.296
<i>the pain of that woman, and
so did a number of other people</i>

2490
02:21:13.381 --> 02:21:17.301
<i>particularly some of the policemen
who were acting in the film also,</i>

2491
02:21:18.052 --> 02:21:21.346
<i>who were no longer working
as cops but were on that...</i>

2492
02:21:21.430 --> 02:21:25.142
<i>in the 703, they were stationed</i>

2493
02:21:25.226 --> 02:21:27.978
<i>and their job was
to keep tabs on</i>

2494
02:21:28.062 --> 02:21:31.065
<i>what Tony Spilotro and
all these people were doing.</i>

2495
02:21:31.148 --> 02:21:34.234
<i>They were now retired and
they'd tell us things that they did</i>

2496
02:21:34.318 --> 02:21:37.070
<i>so we put it in the film,
and they'd act a certain way.</i>

2497
02:21:37.154 --> 02:21:39.156
<i>And a number of
times, a couple of them,</i>

2498
02:21:39.240 --> 02:21:42.785
<i>one nice guy kept saying
that she didn't deserve it.</i>

2499
02:21:43.077 --> 02:21:44.328
<i>She was the best of them.</i>

2500
02:21:44.412 --> 02:21:46.997
<i>She just didn't deserve
what happened to her.</i>

2501
02:21:47.081 --> 02:21:49.374
<i>And it was interesting...</i>

2502
02:21:49.458 --> 02:21:52.961
<i>For me, it was interesting
'cause she really came...</i>

2503
02:21:53.462 --> 02:21:55.505
<i>She stood up to the
challenge, Sharon Stone.</i>

2504
02:21:55.589 --> 02:21:57.465
<i>She was in rehearsals, too.</i>

2505
02:21:57.550 --> 02:22:00.344
<i>And rehearsals had
actually worked very nicely</i>

2506
02:22:00.469 --> 02:22:03.472
<i>and we'd have an assistant
there who was very quiet.</i>

2507
02:22:03.556 --> 02:22:06.100
<i>We'd give him the audio tape</i>

2508
02:22:06.183 --> 02:22:10.312
<i>and he'd type it up, bring it back in,
then we'd work out and rewrite the scene.</i>

2509
02:22:10.396 --> 02:22:13.107
<i>Normally what I
did in</i> Mean Streets

2510
02:22:13.357 --> 02:22:16.234
or Raging Bull... Not
<i>even</i> Raging Bull, but

2511
02:22:16.736 --> 02:22:19.155
Goodfellas, <i>in a
number of scenes</i>

2512
02:22:19.822 --> 02:22:23.700
<i>we'd do different takes on
audio tape, type them all up</i>

2513
02:22:23.993 --> 02:22:27.788
<i>and then I'd put them
together and create the scene</i>

2514
02:22:28.956 --> 02:22:30.832
<i>from the rehearsal sessions.</i>

2515
02:22:30.916 --> 02:22:33.001
<i>So this was very important.</i>

2516
02:22:33.210 --> 02:22:37.005
<i>Then a lot of the other cast,
Alan King, and so many people...</i>

2517
02:22:37.089 --> 02:22:40.217
<i>Some of the old wiseguys who
are supposed to be from Chicago,</i>

2518
02:22:40.301 --> 02:22:43.012
<i>we found them in New Jersey,
somewhere, and Ellen Lewis...</i>

2519
02:22:43.095 --> 02:22:45.138
<i>So it was a very carefully...</i>

2520
02:22:45.222 --> 02:22:48.642
<i>That process was pretty close
to what we did in</i> Goodfellas.

2521
02:22:50.019 --> 02:22:53.564
I want to know if he's
doing all right, if he's okay.

2522
02:22:54.315 --> 02:22:58.815
-He's good, he's fine.
-I'm asking you to keep an eye on Nicky.

2523
02:22:59.361 --> 02:23:01.613
-Do it for me.
-No problem.

2524
02:23:01.781 --> 02:23:06.281
You see, I wouldn't want to be
jeopardizing anything for our friends.

2525
02:23:07.328 --> 02:23:08.495
You understand?

2526
02:23:08.579 --> 02:23:10.539
-I understand.
-Okay.

2527
02:23:12.041 --> 02:23:13.417
<i>ANNOUNCER: Barbara De Fina.</i>

2528
02:23:13.501 --> 02:23:16.170
<i>DE FINA: Well, the
violence in Casino <i>I think is...</i>

2529
02:23:16.879 --> 02:23:20.799
<i>Again, it's a true story and a
lot of it is based on true events</i>

2530
02:23:20.883 --> 02:23:22.885
<i>and things that
people actually did.</i>

2531
02:23:23.177 --> 02:23:27.556
<i>And there is always
the balance between</i>

2532
02:23:28.933 --> 02:23:33.062
<i>showing the reality of how
these people live and behave</i>

2533
02:23:34.021 --> 02:23:38.521
<i>and not completely
offending the audience.</i>

2534
02:23:39.068 --> 02:23:40.486
<i>And sometimes it's hard</i>

2535
02:23:40.569 --> 02:23:43.655
<i>until the movie is finished and
you start showing it to people,</i>

2536
02:23:43.739 --> 02:23:45.949
<i>it's hard when you
have been so close to it</i>

2537
02:23:46.033 --> 02:23:47.701
<i>because we all
know it's not real.</i>

2538
02:23:47.785 --> 02:23:49.828
<i>I watch other peoples' movies</i>

2539
02:23:49.912 --> 02:23:53.832
<i>and I say "Oh, my
God, that's so violent."</i>

2540
02:23:53.916 --> 02:23:57.377
<i>But it's hard when
you are there doing it</i>

2541
02:23:57.920 --> 02:24:01.089
<i>to really have a
good understanding</i>

2542
02:24:01.924 --> 02:24:06.424
<i>of how intense it is or how shocking it
is. You really have to show it to people.</i>

2543
02:24:07.471 --> 02:24:08.638
<i>And so when you shoot,</i>

2544
02:24:08.722 --> 02:24:12.642
<i>you shoot different variations and
different intensities of the violence</i>

2545
02:24:12.726 --> 02:24:15.645
<i>and then during the editing
and showing it to people</i>

2546
02:24:15.729 --> 02:24:17.439
<i>usually means taking it back.</i>

2547
02:24:17.565 --> 02:24:20.859
<i>I mean, I'm not talking about
censorship or the MPAA rating.</i>

2548
02:24:20.943 --> 02:24:22.903
<i>Just generally
sort of taking it,</i>

2549
02:24:23.320 --> 02:24:26.656
<i>showing it to people you
trust and just seeing how they...</i>

2550
02:24:26.824 --> 02:24:29.326
<i>Because you want
it to be upsetting</i>

2551
02:24:29.493 --> 02:24:32.787
<i>but you don't want it to be
so upsetting that people can't</i>

2552
02:24:32.913 --> 02:24:35.749
<i>look at it or they
think it's too upsetting</i>

2553
02:24:36.125 --> 02:24:39.753
<i>or it just ruins the whole
experience of the movie.</i>

2554
02:24:41.463 --> 02:24:43.965
<i>I think the violence
in his movies</i>

2555
02:24:44.967 --> 02:24:46.301
<i>always has a...</i>

2556
02:24:48.262 --> 02:24:52.099
<i>When somebody does something
really bad and somebody's really violent</i>

2557
02:24:52.183 --> 02:24:56.020
<i>there is a morality to what
happens to them, there's a result.</i>

2558
02:24:56.812 --> 02:25:00.106
<i>So if somebody
really shoots a gun</i>

2559
02:25:01.775 --> 02:25:03.443
<i>and somebody gets shot,</i>

2560
02:25:03.611 --> 02:25:07.072
<i>unlike in television and
other movies, you actually see</i>

2561
02:25:07.156 --> 02:25:08.657
<i>that they have been hurt</i>

2562
02:25:08.782 --> 02:25:12.577
<i>and they have been wounded, and
it's bloody and it's really shocking.</i>

2563
02:25:12.661 --> 02:25:16.164
<i>I think so much of the violence
in other people's movies</i>

2564
02:25:16.290 --> 02:25:18.250
<i>and on television,
in particular,</i>

2565
02:25:18.334 --> 02:25:20.878
<i>people are shooting
one another all the time</i>

2566
02:25:20.961 --> 02:25:23.213
<i>and there never seems
to be any real result.</i>

2567
02:25:24.006 --> 02:25:25.590
<i>They cut away</i>

2568
02:25:25.674 --> 02:25:28.218
<i>and there's never any
blood, there's never any...</i>

2569
02:25:28.302 --> 02:25:32.802
<i>It's like a game. I think
it's sending a message</i>

2570
02:25:33.140 --> 02:25:35.851
<i>that you can take a gun
and fire it at someone</i>

2571
02:25:35.976 --> 02:25:37.811
<i>and nothing really happens.</i>

2572
02:25:38.312 --> 02:25:40.272
<i>And I think in Marty's movies</i>

2573
02:25:40.356 --> 02:25:43.150
<i>when somebody
gets shot, you see it,</i>

2574
02:25:43.317 --> 02:25:45.193
<i>when somebody
gets hit, you see it.</i>

2575
02:25:45.653 --> 02:25:49.323
<i>And then usually that person,
who has been living this life</i>

2576
02:25:49.907 --> 02:25:51.825
<i>of crime and violence,</i>

2577
02:25:51.909 --> 02:25:54.161
<i>usually in the end</i>

2578
02:25:54.411 --> 02:25:56.579
<i>something happens
to him, as well.</i>

2579
02:25:56.664 --> 02:25:59.500
<i>"You live by the sword,
you die by the sword."</i>

2580
02:25:59.583 --> 02:26:01.084
<i>So there is a moral...</i>

2581
02:26:01.168 --> 02:26:04.421
<i>In a strange way, there is
this very strict morality to it.</i>

2582
02:26:05.005 --> 02:26:08.508
<i>And I think, even though
the movies are very violent</i>

2583
02:26:08.592 --> 02:26:10.802
<i>they don't show that lifestyle</i>

2584
02:26:10.886 --> 02:26:13.847
<i>as being particularly
attractive in the end.</i>

2585

NICKY: I said I'm not sure. I'll let
you know. I want to think about it.

2591
02:26:31.699 --> 02:26:33.742

2592
02:26:33.867 --> 02:26:36.578
<i>Generations of graduate

2593

<i>But I have to say, it
kind of makes you sick</i>

2657
02:30:31.230 --> 02:30:35.730
<i>'cause then you spend weeks
where you are just nauseous</i>

2658
02:30:36.443 --> 02:30:38.820
<i>and kind of freaked out and...</i>

2659
02:30:40.322 --> 02:30:43.992
<i>It's actually freaky and scary</i>

2660
02:30:45.619 --> 02:30:48.747
<i>to be nominated for these
big awards. It's kind of,</i>

2661
02:30:50.916 --> 02:30:55.416
<i>you're really excited for two days and
then you're basically sick till it happens.</i>

<i>ANNOUNCER: Rita Ryack.</i>

2663
02:30:57.798 --> 02:30:59.299
<i>RYACK: Love the gold.</i>

2664
02:30:59.424 --> 02:31:01.509
<i>I can't remember exactly
where that came from.</i>

2665
02:31:01.593 --> 02:31:02.969
<i>I think we were talking,</i>

2666
02:31:03.095 --> 02:31:06.848
<i>"Wouldn't it be great if we had a
kind of motorcycle jacket silhouette?"</i>

2667
02:31:06.974 --> 02:31:08.558
<i>I am always inspired by fabrics</i>

2668
02:31:08.642 --> 02:31:11.519
<i>and I think that we loved
pearlized leather for her</i>

2669
02:31:11.645 --> 02:31:14.814
<i>for some reason. It just
had that special flash.</i>

2670
02:31:15.607 --> 02:31:19.485
<i>And I had these gold skins</i>

2671
02:31:19.820 --> 02:31:20.821
<i>(CHUCKLES)</i>

2672
02:31:21.530 --> 02:31:25.659
<i>and this other stuff this kind
of suede reptile. Not reptile.</i>

2673
02:31:25.993 --> 02:31:27.869
<i>I said, "We gotta
put these together.</i>

2674
02:31:27.995 --> 02:31:31.999
<i>"Let's do a motorcycle jacket and pants
and let's show that she's deteriorated.</i>

2675
02:31:32.124 --> 02:31:34.709
<i>"Let's give them
a nice baggy ass</i>

2676
02:31:34.835 --> 02:31:39.335
<i>"to show that she's really declining,
but she's still wearing this armor."</i>

2677
02:31:40.674 --> 02:31:44.386
<i>It's almost protective armor.
That's another thing about leather.</i>

2678
02:31:44.511 --> 02:31:48.223
<i>Now it doesn't define the
body, as it did in the black pants</i>

2679
02:31:48.348 --> 02:31:51.642
<i>and some white leather
pants that she wears earlier.</i>

2680
02:31:53.020 --> 02:31:56.523
<i>It reveals that she is no
longer filling that armor out.</i>

2681
02:31:58.025 --> 02:32:00.819
<i>You really notice
the fit, I think</i>

2682
02:32:01.361 --> 02:32:05.239
<i>when she falls down the stairs
at Nicky's restaurant at the end.</i>

2683
02:32:07.868 --> 02:32:09.870
NICKY: Get down
there! Take it easy!

2684
02:32:09.995 --> 02:32:12.664
I shouldn't have gotten
involved with this nut!

2685
02:32:12.748 --> 02:32:14.875
You'll kill her. Take it easy.

2686
02:32:15.542 --> 02:32:16.876
<i>ANNOUNCER: Sharon Stone.</i>

2687
02:32:17.502 --> 02:32:21.756
<i>STONE: There is a point
where she really realizes that</i>

2688
02:32:22.591 --> 02:32:25.010
<i>she's got nothing left to lose.</i>

2689
02:32:28.847 --> 02:32:31.182
<i>And, you know, there's a saying</i>

2690
02:32:32.684 --> 02:32:37.184
<i>that a woman will take herself down
into the gutter to take a man with her.</i>

2691
02:32:39.232 --> 02:32:42.068
<i>She was that kind of broad.</i>

2692
02:32:43.612 --> 02:32:45.864
<i>And when it hits that point...</i>

2693
02:32:48.408 --> 02:32:51.244
<i>And I really wanted
to do my own driving</i>

2694
02:32:51.787 --> 02:32:55.749
<i>when I smashed up his car and
drove my car into the back of his car.</i>

2695
02:32:56.833 --> 02:33:00.837
<i>And I have to tell you there
was a point when I hit his car</i>

2696
02:33:00.921 --> 02:33:03.757
<i>and my bumper got hooked
on the back of the bumper</i>

2697
02:33:03.840 --> 02:33:05.258
<i>and I put the car in reverse</i>

2698
02:33:05.342 --> 02:33:09.054
<i>and the car was just grinding
and it was pulling the car.</i>

2699
02:33:09.513 --> 02:33:11.515
<i>There are very
few times in my life</i>

2700
02:33:11.598 --> 02:33:16.098
<i>when I felt that kind of
down-in-my—guts exhilaration</i>

2701
02:33:16.728 --> 02:33:20.940
<i>where I was just loving
beating the shit out of that car.</i>

2702
02:33:21.608 --> 02:33:24.193
<i>It was just so fantastic.</i>

2703
02:33:24.277 --> 02:33:27.113
<i>The freedom of that kind of rage</i>

2704
02:33:27.948 --> 02:33:29.783
<i>is really fantastic.</i>

2705
02:33:32.035 --> 02:33:33.786
<i>And I really understood</i>

2706
02:33:34.621 --> 02:33:37.248
<i>that kind of thing</i>

2707
02:33:39.793 --> 02:33:43.880
<i>and we got that piece and I
was driving across the lawn</i>

2708
02:33:44.631 --> 02:33:46.633
<i>and I threw the car door open</i>

2709
02:33:47.467 --> 02:33:49.218
<i>and I realized...</i>

2710
02:33:50.804 --> 02:33:54.265
<i>And it's the cops and Bob</i>

2711
02:33:55.559 --> 02:33:57.227
<i>and I turned to Marty and said,</i>

2712
02:33:57.310 --> 02:34:00.438
<i>"Can we hold it?
Hold me if I fall down."</i>

2713
02:34:01.982 --> 02:34:04.901
<i>And we backed the
camera because I thought</i>

2714
02:34:04.985 --> 02:34:06.987
<i>it's so much more powerful.</i>

2715
02:34:07.988 --> 02:34:09.906
<i>She has more power</i>

2716
02:34:09.990 --> 02:34:13.910
<i>if she actually falls
down in the yard, too.</i>

2717
02:34:14.578 --> 02:34:18.164
<i>Like it's more
horrifying for him</i>

2718
02:34:19.291 --> 02:34:22.919
<i>if once she smashes up the
car, then she falls on the ground.</i>

2719
02:34:23.295 --> 02:34:25.005
<i>The worse it is</i>

2720
02:34:28.133 --> 02:34:29.342
<i>for him...</i>

2721
02:34:29.468 --> 02:34:33.968
<i>The more vulgar she is, the
more powerful she becomes</i>

2722
02:34:34.765 --> 02:34:37.017
<i>because it's so
horrifying for him.</i>

2723
02:34:39.644 --> 02:34:42.938
<i>That's when I really
understood what that meant.</i>

2724
02:34:44.441 --> 02:34:46.359
<i>And that's that kind of</i>

2725
02:34:46.777 --> 02:34:49.029
<i>breakthrough moment</i>

2726
02:34:50.530 --> 02:34:52.281
<i>when she's just</i>

2727
02:34:53.700 --> 02:34:55.868
<i>crushing him with
her own vulgarity.</i>

2728
02:34:56.286 --> 02:35:00.498
<i>And it's so freeing for her because
she's got nothing left to lose.</i>

2729
02:35:03.543 --> 02:35:05.711
What are you
looking at? Fuck off!

2730

Go back inside! This is
none of your business.

2731
02:35:09.382 --> 02:35:11.967

shit all the time anymore.

2732
02:35:12.052 --> 02:35:14.637
I Will go to the FBI!
I'll go to the police!

2733
02:35:14.721 --> 02:35:17.390
-I am not protecting you anymore!
-Mrs. Rothstein...

2734
02:35:17.557 --> 02:35:18.975
GINGER: He won't let me inside!

2735
02:35:22.896 --> 02:35:26.149
Mr. Rothstein, we've been getting
some complaints about the noise.

2736
02:35:26.233 --> 02:35:28.026
I'm just trying to
get in my house.

<i>ANNOUNCER: Thelma Schoonmaker.</i>

<i>SCHOONMAKER: Marty always
has humor throughout his films.</i>

2739
02:35:33.198 --> 02:35:35.825
<i>It's not up—front kind of humor</i>

2740
02:35:36.743 --> 02:35:38.995
<i>but it's humanity, it's
the way people behave</i>

2741
02:35:39.079 --> 02:35:42.916
<i>(LAUGHS) and the way things
are sometimes said unexpectedly</i>

2742
02:35:43.875 --> 02:35:45.042
<i>that are bizarre.</i>

2743
02:35:45.335 --> 02:35:49.505
<i>He's always had tremendous
humor in his films, from the beginning.</i>

2744
02:35:49.840 --> 02:35:52.175
<i>And so here, as usual</i>

2745
02:35:52.259 --> 02:35:56.263
<i>Marty loves to capitalize on any
accident that occurs and the improvisation.</i>

2746
02:35:56.388 --> 02:35:57.847
<i>And if it was humorous,</i>

2747
02:35:57.931 --> 02:36:01.601
<i>for example, the way Sharon Stone
was throwing things at Bob was so funny</i>

2748
02:36:01.726 --> 02:36:03.269
<i>and his reaction with</i>

2749
02:36:04.229 --> 02:36:06.439
<i>the leaves flying
in front of his face</i>

2750
02:36:06.523 --> 02:36:10.026
<i>(LAUGHING) and him just
going like this to the cops was...</i>

2751
02:36:10.110 --> 02:36:13.113
<i>We did pull that out
as much as we could.</i>

2752
02:36:13.238 --> 02:36:16.866
<i>But it was there, believe
me. I didn't have to find it.</i>

2753
02:36:16.950 --> 02:36:20.620
<i>And it's just a matter of finding
a way to make the improvisation</i>

2754
02:36:20.704 --> 02:36:23.790
<i>hang together dramatically,
and yet get the best of the humor.</i>

02:36:26.042 --> 02:36:29.879
<i>PILEGGI: I was in Las Vegas all during
the shoot but I never went to the set.</i>

2757
02:36:29.963 --> 02:36:33.549
<i>I was within walking distance of
the set for three or four months.</i>

2758
02:36:33.633 --> 02:36:35.051
<i>I never went once</i>

2759
02:36:35.135 --> 02:36:38.721
<i>because I just feel that I'd
get in the way, you don't really...</i>

2760
02:36:38.805 --> 02:36:42.475
<i>You're not performing any
service if you're "just the writer."</i>

2761
02:36:43.977 --> 02:36:47.480
<i>And there's so much
technical stuff going on</i>

2762
02:36:47.939 --> 02:36:49.774
<i>and if you do get there</i>

2763
02:36:50.150 --> 02:36:51.818
<i>people come over to say hello,</i>

2764
02:36:51.943 --> 02:36:55.905
<i>they haven't seen you and all that stuff.
It just interrupts the rhythm, I feel.</i>

2765
02:36:55.989 --> 02:36:58.908
<i>And I don't get a kick
out of it, to begin with</i>

2766
02:36:58.992 --> 02:37:00.493
<i>because it's all so technical.</i>

2767
02:37:00.577 --> 02:37:03.746
<i>They shoot like 30 seconds, or
a minute, or a minute-and-a—half</i>

2768
02:37:03.830 --> 02:37:07.083
<i>and then they change all the
lights and it takes another half hour.</i>

2769
02:37:07.167 --> 02:37:08.585
<i>If you're just watching it,</i>

2770
02:37:08.668 --> 02:37:11.962
<i>it's not anything that I
really care to do, so I don't.</i>

2771
02:37:12.172 --> 02:37:16.134
<i>And therefore I don't bother going
to the dailies or do any of that stuff.</i>

2772
02:37:18.011 --> 02:37:21.681
<i>So when I was in New York,
they had a rough cut of the movie.</i>

2773
02:37:22.766 --> 02:37:25.268
<i>And Marty said, "I want
you to see the cut." Sure.</i>

2774
02:37:25.352 --> 02:37:28.355
<i>And he'll often tell me
when he wants me to see it</i>

2775
02:37:28.438 --> 02:37:31.524
<i>because he's really got
it laid out in sequence.</i>

2776
02:37:31.608 --> 02:37:34.277
<i>He'll have other
people or me see it first.</i>

2777
02:37:34.361 --> 02:37:38.031
<i>'Cause he's curious about what
my reaction will be to something else.</i>

2778
02:37:38.198 --> 02:37:40.241
<i>Sometimes he
tells me where to sit.</i>

2779
02:37:40.325 --> 02:37:43.161
<i>"Don't sit there." I say, "Why
not?" He says, "Sit over there.</i>

2780
02:37:43.244 --> 02:37:46.372
<i>"I wanna watch you..."
So it's that kind of thing.</i>

2781
02:37:46.456 --> 02:37:47.832
<i>(LAUGHS)</i>

2782
02:37:47.916 --> 02:37:51.669
<i>He said, "I want you to see
the rough cut." I said, "Great."</i>

2783
02:37:51.753 --> 02:37:53.963
<i>He said, "You're gonna
be watching it with Ace."</i>

2784
02:37:54.047 --> 02:37:55.423
<i>I said, "Oh, no."</i>

2785
02:37:55.507 --> 02:37:57.717
<i>Ace and I went
to a small theater.</i>

2786
02:37:59.761 --> 02:38:02.221
<i>Just the two of us in
this theater, watching.</i>

2787
02:38:02.305 --> 02:38:05.766
<i>That's how I saw it for
the first time, and it was just</i>

2788
02:38:06.226 --> 02:38:07.977
<i>unbelievable to see.</i>

2789
02:38:08.061 --> 02:38:10.730
<i>Fine, you wrote it, but
you can't put it all together.</i>

2790
02:38:10.814 --> 02:38:14.192
<i>You can't put
the Bass titles on,</i>

2791
02:38:14.275 --> 02:38:16.986
you <i>can't</i> put the Saint
Matthew's Passion.

2792
02:38:17.070 --> 02:38:19.447
<i>When you are writing,
you are on a computer.</i>

2793
02:38:19.531 --> 02:38:24.031
<i>You don't have the orchestra,
the color, all of that stuff laid out.</i>

2794
02:38:24.202 --> 02:38:26.954
<i>When you type the fact
that he gets up from his desk</i>

2795
02:38:27.038 --> 02:38:29.915
<i>and walks to the
closet without his pants,</i>

2796
02:38:30.375 --> 02:38:34.712
<i>you don't have the color
turquoise socks. That all comes...</i>

2797
02:38:34.921 --> 02:38:36.672
<i>That's your costume person,</i>

2798
02:38:36.756 --> 02:38:40.426
<i>that's your set designer, that's
Marty's vision for how it goes.</i>

2799
02:38:40.510 --> 02:38:42.512
<i>And so you see
it for the first time,</i>

2800
02:38:42.595 --> 02:38:45.222
<i>it sort of explodes, the
movie explodes for you</i>

2801
02:38:45.306 --> 02:38:46.765
<i>if you are the writer.</i>

2802
02:38:46.850 --> 02:38:50.436
<i>And it also exploded
for Ace. He just got up...</i>

2803
02:38:51.062 --> 02:38:53.355
<i>You would never do
anything like hug Ace</i>

2804
02:38:53.440 --> 02:38:57.819
<i>but we came as close
to doing that as you can.</i>

2805
02:38:58.319 --> 02:39:01.363
<i>'Cause I think he was really
pleased and he was, you know...</i>

2806
02:39:01.448 --> 02:39:03.992
<i>All of that angst
and all of that,</i>

2807
02:39:04.993 --> 02:39:07.328
<i>the memory of that nightmare</i>

2808
02:39:08.038 --> 02:39:10.290
<i>that he lived through, I think,</i>

2809
02:39:10.457 --> 02:39:12.750
<i>he felt happy that
he had helped.</i>

2810
02:39:13.877 --> 02:39:16.921
<i>The final result was more
than I could have dreamed of.</i>

2811
02:39:17.005 --> 02:39:21.009
<i>I mean, it's such a
big movie, it's so grand</i>

2812
02:39:21.092 --> 02:39:25.346
<i>and it tells such a... It's
complicated but it tells a simple story.</i>

2813
02:39:25.722 --> 02:39:28.683
<i>But it's complicated
in a good way.</i>

2814
02:39:28.975 --> 02:39:31.769
<i>I think it's rich</i>

2815
02:39:31.853 --> 02:39:35.606
<i>in what it shows of that period.</i>

2816
02:39:36.483 --> 02:39:40.983
<i>And I'm not talking about the writing part.
I'm talking about what Marty did with it.</i>

2817
02:39:41.821 --> 02:39:42.988
<i>The combination of...</i>

2818
02:39:43.073 --> 02:39:45.992
<i>I mean, I gave him a
structure from the book</i>

2819
02:39:46.076 --> 02:39:48.411
<i>and then we wrote
the screenplay.</i>

2820
02:39:48.495 --> 02:39:52.373
<i>But that screenplay was so
enhanced, as screenplays are</i>

2821
02:39:52.791 --> 02:39:54.584
<i>by camera angles</i>

2822
02:39:55.210 --> 02:39:57.295
<i>and mood and color.</i>

2823
02:39:58.421 --> 02:40:01.632

so important to Marty.</i>

<i>I would know,</i>

2841
02:40:51.307 --> 02:40:54.518

<i>or she would tell me, or somehow</i>

2843
02:41:02.819 --> 02:41:05.738
<i>I would get it. And instead</i>

2844
02:41:08.992 --> 02:41:11.869
<i>the freight train
of this character</i>

2845
02:41:12.203 --> 02:41:14.246

2846
02:41:14.998 --> 02:41:18.334
<i>and it was just going and going.</i>

2847
02:41:18.918 --> 02:41:23.339
<i>And I wanted to lose
the weight at the end</i>

2848
02:41:23.923 --> 02:41:28.423
<i>to be increasingly involved
in the drug and alcohol life.</i>

2849
02:41:29.679 --> 02:41:32.264
<i>And I started just
dropping the weight.</i>

2850
02:41:32.599 --> 02:41:35.935
<i>Marty had said, "We'll shoot the
death scene whenever you want to.</i>

2851
02:41:36.060 --> 02:41:38.520
<i>"We don't have to
shoot it at the end.</i>

2852
02:41:38.605 --> 02:41:40.273
<i>"You'll just call me and say,</i>

<i>"Tm ready to shoot it,' and
that's when we'll shoot it."</i>

2854
02:41:43.193 --> 02:41:46.613
<i>So I was losing that weight</i>

2855
02:41:47.280 --> 02:41:51.200
<i>and I was getting pretty nuts.</i>

2856
02:41:53.077 --> 02:41:56.455
<i>Anyone who was on
that show will tell you</i>

2857
02:41:56.581 --> 02:42:01.081

of normal perspective.</i>

2858
02:42:02.420 --> 02:42:04.130
<i>I wasn't eating.</i>

2859
02:42:04.214 --> 02:42:07.217
<i>We were working crazy hours.</i>

2860
02:42:09.260 --> 02:42:12.388
<i>I was so involved
in this character</i>

2861
02:42:16.893 --> 02:42:20.980
<i>and I was just waiting
to know and obsessed</i>

2862
02:42:21.940 --> 02:42:26.235

in my house and flooding my house.</i>

2863

it three times.</i>

2865
02:42:35.495 --> 02:42:39.995
<i>I had become this animal

2866
02:42:41.167 --> 02:42:43.169
<i>to give it to me</i>

2867
02:42:43.419 --> 02:42:47.506
<i>and give it up to me what was
happening, and that was all I could do.</i>

2868
02:42:47.590 --> 02:42:49.341
<i>I couldn't even think straight.</i>

2869
02:42:49.425 --> 02:42:53.095
<i>I was reaching out around

2870
02:42:53.179 --> 02:42:56.932
<i>I'd lost complete grip</i>

2874

<i>And at the end,</i>

2875
02:43:20.290 --> 02:43:24.790
<i>I just called Marty and said, "Okay,
I'm ready to do the death scene."</i>

2876
02:43:26.462 --> 02:43:28.839

<i>(GROANS)</i>

2878
02:43:32.385 --> 02:43:34.637

2879
02:43:38.016 --> 02:43:41.060
<i>They were good.
Marty felt like we had it.</i>

2880
02:43:42.645 --> 02:43:46.565
<i>And then I really felt
her presence with me.</i>

2881
02:43:48.192 --> 02:43:52.029
<i>And I just really started
to understand the process</i>

2882
02:43:52.155 --> 02:43:56.492
<i>and why I'd done it, and what it
was about, and it got really clear.</i>

2883
02:44:00.747 --> 02:44:03.666
<i>I told Marty I wanted
to do another take</i>

2884
02:44:03.916 --> 02:44:07.085
<i>because I was so
clear of her presence.</i>

2885
02:44:11.591 --> 02:44:14.927
<i>And I went down the
hallway and it was so different.</i>

2886
02:44:16.763 --> 02:44:19.682
<i>I was floating down the hallway.</i>

2887
02:44:21.768 --> 02:44:24.604
<i>And I couldn't really
see where I was going.</i>

2888
02:44:25.271 --> 02:44:27.898
<i>And I reached towards the end</i>

2889
02:44:29.108 --> 02:44:33.195
<i>and I had this thing where
my heart came up my throat.</i>

2890
02:44:33.279 --> 02:44:35.531

<i>(THUMPING)</i>

2892
02:44:37.617 --> 02:44:41.621
<i>And I let go of
the wall, and I just</i>

2893
02:44:42.622 --> 02:44:45.124
<i>sort of came up off my feet</i>

2894
02:44:45.208 --> 02:44:48.711
<i>and I hit the ground.
And when I hit the ground</i>

2895
02:44:49.462 --> 02:44:52.089
<i>this sound came out of my body</i>

2896
02:44:52.799 --> 02:44:57.299
<i>and this kind of visible
thing came out of my body.</i>

2897
02:44:58.012 --> 02:44:59.471
<i>(GROANS)</i>

2898
02:45:02.308 --> 02:45:05.644
<i>And I could see this happen.</i>

2899
02:45:07.397 --> 02:45:10.817
<i>And everybody in the room
heard this thing happen.</i>

2900
02:45:11.651 --> 02:45:14.278
<i>And I just lay there,</i>

2901
02:45:15.154 --> 02:45:16.780
<i>couldn't get up.</i>

2902
02:45:17.615 --> 02:45:19.992
<i>Marty cut. Nobody moved.</i>

2903
02:45:21.452 --> 02:45:25.952
<i>And eventually Marty
came over and sat with me.</i>

2904
02:45:30.253 --> 02:45:33.339
<i>And we all... Nobody
kind of knew what to do.</i>

2905
02:45:34.257 --> 02:45:37.843
<i>And then he asked me if I
was okay or if I needed help</i>

2906
02:45:37.969 --> 02:45:40.846
<i>or if we needed to
go to the hospital or...</i>

2907
02:45:45.351 --> 02:45:48.520
<i>But everybody was just impaled</i>

2908
02:45:48.980 --> 02:45:52.525
<i>by the intensity of this
thing that had just happened.</i>

2909
02:45:57.447 --> 02:46:01.947
<i>And that was when the
Ginger thing just kind of left.</i>

2910
02:46:07.540 --> 02:46:12.040
<i>I felt that the witnessing
of her presence</i>

2911
02:46:14.046 --> 02:46:16.006
<i>had been completed.</i>

2912
02:46:20.636 --> 02:46:24.973
<i>I thought that Marty
was very smart</i>

2913
02:46:25.057 --> 02:46:26.892
<i>to have left that until the end</i>

2914
02:46:27.018 --> 02:46:30.229
<i>and to have left it to be
when it was appropriate.</i>

2915
02:46:31.397 --> 02:46:35.150
<i>And sometimes I think
things just need a witness</i>

2916
02:46:35.234 --> 02:46:37.569
<i>maybe more than
they need an answer.</i>

<i>because you're not
supposed to shoot deer there</i>

2959

some deer, and buried the bodies.</i>

up and he starts digging to find a deer.</i>

02:49:44.882 --> 02:49:47.759
<i>when they were buried. So it
was a really very brutal death.</i>

2972
02:49:47.843 --> 02:49:51.513
<i>And the Ace character, no one
really knows who blew him up.</i>

2973
02:49:51.764 --> 02:49:55.934
<i>The suspicion is now that it
was not the powers that be</i>

2974
02:49:56.602 --> 02:50:00.188
<i>or he would've been killed
again. It was just some...</i>

2975
02:50:00.272 --> 02:50:04.442
<i>Probably they feel it might've been
somebody doing it for the Nicky character</i>

2976
02:50:04.568 --> 02:50:07.612
<i>because they were so bitter
and angry at each other at the end.</i>

2977
02:50:07.738 --> 02:50:10.115
<i>And the thing
about this Cadillac</i>

2978
02:50:10.241 --> 02:50:12.618
<i>was because there had
been a balancing problem,</i>

2979
02:50:12.743 --> 02:50:15.620
<i>they had put a metal
plate under the seat</i>

2980
02:50:16.789 --> 02:50:18.290
<i>of the driver</i>

2981
02:50:18.541 --> 02:50:21.627
<i>and the bomb had been
placed under the passenger seat.</i>

2982
02:50:22.628 --> 02:50:24.880
<i>So when the bomb went off,</i>

2983
02:50:25.798 --> 02:50:29.468
<i>the impact of the
bomb was deflected</i>

2984
02:50:29.593 --> 02:50:31.469
<i>by that metal plate.</i>

2985
02:50:31.554 --> 02:50:36.054
<i>The power of a bomb is going to
go where it has the least resistance.</i>

2986
02:50:36.142 --> 02:50:38.394
<i>So it had resistance
under his seat.</i>

2987
02:50:38.477 --> 02:50:41.480
<i>He was able to get the door
open and roll off onto the street.</i>

2988
02:50:41.605 --> 02:50:44.983
<i>He was injured. He went to the
hospital and was banged up badly.</i>

2989
02:50:45.109 --> 02:50:47.986
<i>He got away just in time.
There was a secondary explosion</i>

2990
02:50:48.112 --> 02:50:51.073
<i>but he was out of the car
by then. 80 it was pure...</i>

2991
02:50:51.157 --> 02:50:54.076
<i>Nobody knew that
there was that steel plate</i>

2992
02:50:54.744 --> 02:50:59.244
<i>and it was only there because of the
technical problem with that Cadillac.</i>

2993
02:50:59.331 --> 02:51:00.749
<i>ANNOUNCER: Thelma Schoonmaker.</i>

2994
02:51:00.833 --> 02:51:02.835
<i>SCHOONMAKER: At the
time that Casino <i>came out,</i>

2995
02:51:02.960 --> 02:51:07.460
<i>a lot of people expected it to
be another</i> Goodfellas, <i>I think.</i>

2996
02:51:09.175 --> 02:51:13.512
<i>Marty and I were
upset by that attitude</i>

2997
02:51:13.804 --> 02:51:18.304
<i>as if everything we made had
to be a sequel to</i> Goodfellas.

2998
02:51:18.476 --> 02:51:22.976
<i>It's a problem we have with all of our films
because people loved Goodfellas so much.</i>

2999
02:51:24.190 --> 02:51:26.775
<i>For me, I thought the
choice was so interesting</i>

3000
02:51:26.859 --> 02:51:29.528
<i>because it wasn't
just another mafia film,</i>

3001
02:51:29.612 --> 02:51:32.948
<i>although the mafia is
obviously predominant in it.</i>

3002
02:51:34.450 --> 02:51:38.950
<i>But what was interesting was Marty's feeling
that he wanted to make a statement about</i>

3003
02:51:40.206 --> 02:51:43.792
<i>greed and how it
can destroy you.</i>

3004
02:51:44.126 --> 02:51:47.462
<i>So I, of course, thought
that was a wonderful subject.</i>

3005
02:51:49.465 --> 02:51:52.468
<i>Frank Rosenthal was the
perfect person to hang it on.</i>

3006
02:51:52.718 --> 02:51:55.303
<i>And so, for me, that's
what it was all about</i>

3007
02:51:55.387 --> 02:51:58.723
<i>because that's always the
way Marty talked to me about it.</i>

3008
02:51:58.849 --> 02:52:03.061
<i>But he really wanted to make a statement
about what America was doing to itself</i>

3009
02:52:03.229 --> 02:52:05.064
<i>and continues to do to itself.</i>

3010
02:52:05.189 --> 02:52:09.401
<i>He really wanted to lay down
what greed was going to mean</i>

3011
02:52:09.902 --> 02:52:12.237
<i>and how</i>

3012
02:52:12.321 --> 02:52:15.240
<i>this shallow culture</i>

3013
02:52:16.367 --> 02:52:19.995
<i>was going to be a
problem for America.</i>

3014
02:52:20.079 --> 02:52:23.499
<i>And he really wanted to lay that
down. It's not a film about the mafia.</i>

3015
02:52:23.582 --> 02:52:26.334
<i>It's interesting 'cause they
are in it all over the place.</i>

3016
02:52:26.418 --> 02:52:29.671
<i>Wonderful actors improvising
great flavor to them.</i>

3017
02:52:30.256 --> 02:52:32.258
<i>But that's not what it's about.</i>

3018
02:52:32.383 --> 02:52:35.511
<i>To a certain extent, it is
a Western, but I think he...</i>

3019
02:52:35.594 --> 02:52:38.847
<i>Secretly, he probably has
always wanted to make a real one</i>

3020
02:52:38.931 --> 02:52:42.768
<i>but since he isn't particularly
comfortable around horses,</i>

3021
02:52:42.852 --> 02:52:43.853
<i>(LAUGHING) I don't know.</i>

3022
02:52:43.936 --> 02:52:48.436
<i>But, of course, he admires so much
the great masters of the Western.</i>

3023
02:52:51.235 --> 02:52:55.735
<i>He can watch them over and over. I
am sure there was some flavor of it there.</i>

3024
02:52:55.948 --> 02:52:57.115
<i>ANNOUNCER: Martin Scorsese.</i>

3025
02:52:57.241 --> 02:53:00.535
<i>SCORSESE: It was how much is enough?
It's never enough, we gotta keep going</i>

3026
02:53:00.619 --> 02:53:05.119
<i>till everything explodes and
comes down. That's also, in a sense</i>

3027
02:53:05.624 --> 02:53:08.460
<i>the idea of</i> Casino <i>as a kind of</i>

3028
02:53:10.129 --> 02:53:12.214
<i>metaphor for Hollywood, too.</i>

3029
02:53:12.298 --> 02:53:16.468
<i>And making bigger pictures, flashier,
and more hundreds of millions of dollars</i>

3030
02:53:16.552 --> 02:53:20.639
<i>till finally it's going to explode, and
the bottom is going fall right out of it.</i>

3031
02:53:20.806 --> 02:53:22.641
<i>And we have to continue</i>

3032
02:53:23.475 --> 02:53:27.061
<i>the nature of cinema in a
different way, ultimately, in America,</i>

3033
02:53:27.396 --> 02:53:30.315
<i>I think, unless it
will split forever</i>

3034
02:53:31.108 --> 02:53:34.236
<i>between the gigantic
budgeted pictures</i>

3035
02:53:34.320 --> 02:53:36.822
<i>which are, at times,
very well done.</i>

3036
02:53:36.906 --> 02:53:40.826
<i>A" the new techniques are extraordinary.
Some are done better than others</i>

3037
02:53:40.951 --> 02:53:43.411
<i>but can't take much
chance at the box office</i>

3038
02:53:43.579 --> 02:53:45.247
<i>because you need a lot of money</i>

3039
02:53:45.331 --> 02:53:48.917
<i>to make the movie. Which means a
lot of people have to see the movie</i>

3040
02:53:49.001 --> 02:53:51.503
<i>to make back some money.</i>

3041
02:53:51.879 --> 02:53:54.339
<i>And any film that
has any kind of</i>

3042
02:53:56.800 --> 02:54:00.428
<i>edge to it or something
where you're thinking more</i>

3043
02:54:00.512 --> 02:54:04.224
<i>than just something
which is black and white,</i>

3044
02:54:05.142 --> 02:54:07.185
<i>good characters
and bad characters.</i>

3045
02:54:07.311 --> 02:54:08.603
<i>This is what the moral is.</i>

3046
02:54:08.687 --> 02:54:11.981
<i>Then having to tell the audience
constantly what the moral is</i>

3047
02:54:12.066 --> 02:54:15.778
<i>and indicate how they should feel
with music, and all kinds of overdoing.</i>

3048
02:54:15.861 --> 02:54:19.239
<i>There are other films in America
being made by younger people,</i>

3049
02:54:19.365 --> 02:54:23.243
<i>some excellent ones with lower budgets,
but they'll always have that lower budget.</i>

3050
02:54:23.369 --> 02:54:27.164
<i>It might be interesting to see if those
people would ever be given a chance</i>

3051
02:54:27.247 --> 02:54:29.123
<i>to be given more money</i>

3052
02:54:29.208 --> 02:54:33.708
<i>the way a number of people were given,
including myself, at some points in the 703.</i>

3053
02:54:35.255 --> 02:54:39.050
<i>But that, I think, is long gone,
and probably will never come back.</i>

3054
02:54:39.385 --> 02:54:41.553
<i>So this was sort of</i>

3055
02:54:44.056 --> 02:54:46.349
<i>a moralistic tale for me to tell</i>

3056
02:54:46.850 --> 02:54:51.062
<i>and to get people provocative
and angry, in a way.</i>
