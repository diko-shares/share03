00:00:51.068 --> 00:00:53.320
<i>When you love someone,
you've gotta trust them.</i>

2
00:00:53.404 --> 00:00:55.197
<i>There's no other way.</i>

3
00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.368
<i>You've got to give them the
key to everything that's yours.</i>

4
00:00:59.451 --> 00:01:01.620
<i>Otherwise, what's the point?</i>

5
00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:07.543
<i>And, for a while,
I believed that's the kind of love I had.</i>

6
00:03:14.253 --> 00:03:17.548
<i>Before I ever ran a
casino, or got myself blown up,</i>

7
00:03:17.631 --> 00:03:21.468
<i>Ace Rothstein was a hell of a
handicapper, I can tell you that.</i>

8
00:03:21.635 --> 00:03:23.595
<i>I was so good that whenever I bet,</i>

9
00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:26.306
<i>I could change the odds for
every bookmaker in the country.</i>

10
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.853
<i>I had it down so cold that I
was given paradise on Earth.</i>

11
00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:34.690
<i>I was given one of the biggest
casinos in Las Vegas to run,</i>

12
00:03:34.773 --> 00:03:36.483
<i>the Tangiers,</i>

13
00:03:36.567 --> 00:03:40.112
<i>by the only kind of guys that can
actually get you that kind of money,</i>

14
00:03:40.195 --> 00:03:43.157
<i>$62,700,000.</i>

15
00:03:43.824 --> 00:03:45.242
<i>I don't know all the details.</i>

16
00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:49.580
<i>Nobody knew all the details,
but it should have been perfect.</i>

17
00:03:49.663 --> 00:03:51.665
<i>I mean, he had me, Nicky Santoro,</i>

18
00:03:51.832 --> 00:03:53.876
<i>his best friend, watching his ass</i>

19
00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:57.838
<i>and he had, Ginger,
the woman he loved, on his arm.</i>

20
00:03:58.422 --> 00:04:01.133
<i>But in the end, we fucked it all up.</i>

21
00:04:01.258 --> 00:04:03.260
<i>It should've been so sweet, too.</i>

22
00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:06.764
<i>But it turned out to be the last
time that street guys like us</i>

23
00:04:06.847 --> 00:04:09.808
<i>were ever given anything
that fucking valuable again.</i>

24
00:04:14.438 --> 00:04:17.191
<i>At that time,
Vegas was a place where millions of suckers</i>

25
00:04:17.274 --> 00:04:19.193
<i>flew in every year on their own nickel</i>

26
00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.320
<i>and left behind about a billion dollars.</i>

27
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.699
<i>But at night, you couldn't see the
desert that surrounds Las Vegas.</i>

28
00:04:27.785 --> 00:04:29.077
<i>But it's in the desert</i>

29
00:04:29.161 --> 00:04:31.121
<i>where lots of the town's
problems are solved.</i>

30
00:04:31.705 --> 00:04:33.373
<i>Got a lot of holes in the desert</i>

31
00:04:33.457 --> 00:04:35.793
<i>and a lot of problems are
buried in those holes.</i>

32
00:04:36.585 --> 00:04:38.378
<i>Except you gotta do it right.</i>

33
00:04:38.462 --> 00:04:40.380
<i>You gotta have the hole already dug</i>

34
00:04:40.506 --> 00:04:42.424
<i>before you show up with a package.</i>

35
00:04:42.591 --> 00:04:44.468
<i>Otherwise, you're talking about</i>

36
00:04:44.593 --> 00:04:46.470
<i>a half hour or 45 minutes of digging.</i>

37
00:04:46.553 --> 00:04:49.097
<i>And who knows who's gonna be coming along?</i>

38
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:52.059
<i>Before you know it,
you gotta dig a few more holes.</i>

39
00:04:52.142 --> 00:04:54.728
<i>You could be there all fucking night.</i>

40
00:05:11.578 --> 00:05:12.704
<i>Who could resist?</i>

41
00:05:12.788 --> 00:05:15.499
<i>Anywhere else in the country
I was a bookie, a gambler,</i>

42
00:05:15.582 --> 00:05:17.167
<i>always looking over my shoulder,</i>

43
00:05:17.292 --> 00:05:18.919
<i>hassled by cops, day and night.</i>

44
00:05:19.002 --> 00:05:20.921
<i>But here, I'm Mr. Rothstein.</i>

45
00:05:21.004 --> 00:05:23.966
<i>I'm not only legitimate but running a casino</i>

46
00:05:24.049 --> 00:05:27.177
<i>and that's like selling
people dreams for cash.</i>

47
00:05:27.803 --> 00:05:30.013
<i>I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert,</i>

48
00:05:30.138 --> 00:05:32.349
<i>as my manager and I went to work.</i>

49
00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:35.686
...and this is Ronnie who
takes care of the card room.

50
00:05:38.146 --> 00:05:41.316
<i>For guys like me,
Las Vegas washes away your sins.</i>

51
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.318
<i>It's like a morality car wash.</i>

52
00:05:43.402 --> 00:05:47.114
<i>It does for us what Lourdes
does for humpbacks and cripples.</i>

53
00:05:53.787 --> 00:05:56.123
<i>And along with making us legit</i>

54
00:05:56.248 --> 00:05:58.750
<i>comes cash, tons of it.</i>

55
00:05:59.084 --> 00:06:01.795
<i>What do you think we're doing
in the middle of the desert?</i>

56
00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:03.630
<i>It's all this money.</i>

57
00:06:04.673 --> 00:06:08.886
<i>This is the end result of all the
bright lights and the comp trips,</i>

58
00:06:09.052 --> 00:06:12.306
<i>of all the champagne and free hotel suites</i>

59
00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:14.892
<i>and all the broads and all the booze.</i>

60
00:06:14.975 --> 00:06:18.854
<i>It's all been arranged just
for us to get your money.</i>

61
00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:23.025
<i>That's the truth about Las Vegas.</i>

62
00:06:24.401 --> 00:06:26.069
<i>We're the only winners.</i>

63
00:06:26.153 --> 00:06:28.322
<i>The players don't stand a chance.</i>

64
00:06:28.447 --> 00:06:30.741
<i>And their cash flows from the tables</i>

65
00:06:30.824 --> 00:06:33.744
<i>to our boxes, through the cage</i>

66
00:06:33.827 --> 00:06:36.413
<i>and into the most sacred room in the casino.</i>

67
00:06:37.664 --> 00:06:39.958
<i>The place where they add up all the money,</i>

68
00:06:40.083 --> 00:06:42.419
<i>the holy of holies, the count room.</i>

69
00:06:44.922 --> 00:06:47.382
<i>Now, this place was off-limits,</i>

70
00:06:47.466 --> 00:06:49.635
<i>even I couldn't get inside,
but it was my job</i>

71
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.929
<i>to keep it filled with cash,
that's for sure.</i>

72
00:06:52.012 --> 00:06:54.348
<i>They had so much fucking money in there</i>

73
00:06:54.473 --> 00:06:56.808
<i>you could build a house out of $100 bills.</i>

74
00:06:56.892 --> 00:06:59.227
<i>And the best part was that
the Board of Directors</i>

75
00:06:59.353 --> 00:07:01.688
<i>didn't know what was going on.</i>

76
00:07:01.772 --> 00:07:03.857
<i>I mean, to them everything
looked on the up-and-up.</i>

77
00:07:03.941 --> 00:07:05.651
<i>Right? Wrong.</i>

78
00:07:05.734 --> 00:07:06.985
Verify $5,000.

79
00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:08.695
<i>The guys inside the counting room</i>

80
00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:11.865
<i>were all slipped in there
to skim the joint dry.</i>

81
00:07:12.908 --> 00:07:15.577
<i>They'd do short counts,
they'd lose fill slips.</i>

82
00:07:15.661 --> 00:07:18.246
<i>They'd even take cash
right out of the drop boxes.</i>

83
00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.290
<i>And it was up to this guy here,</i>

84
00:07:20.415 --> 00:07:22.376
<i>standing in front of about $2 million,</i>

85
00:07:22.459 --> 00:07:25.671
<i>to skim the cash off the top
without anybody getting wise,</i>

86
00:07:25.754 --> 00:07:27.547
<i>the IRS or anybody.</i>

87
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.551
<i>Notice how in the count room
nobody ever seems to see anything.</i>

88
00:07:31.677 --> 00:07:33.553
<i>Somebody's always looking the other way.</i>

89
00:07:33.637 --> 00:07:35.973
<i>Look at these guys. They look busy, right?</i>

90
00:07:36.056 --> 00:07:37.265
<i>They're counting money.</i>

91
00:07:37.391 --> 00:07:38.600
<i>Who wants to bother them?</i>

92
00:07:38.684 --> 00:07:42.145
<i>God forbid, they should make
a mistake and forget to steal.</i>

93
00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:44.940
<i>Meanwhile, you're in and you're out.</i>

94
00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:48.860
<i>Past the jag-off guard who
gets an extra C-note a week</i>

95
00:07:48.944 --> 00:07:50.487
<i>just to watch the door.</i>

96
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.240
<i>I mean, it's routine, business as usual.</i>

97
00:07:53.365 --> 00:07:55.993
<i>In, out, hello, goodbye.</i>

98
00:07:56.076 --> 00:07:57.411
<i>That's all there is to it.</i>

99
00:07:57.494 --> 00:08:00.914
<i>Just another fat fuck walking out
of the casino with a suitcase.</i>

100
00:08:02.249 --> 00:08:04.876
<i>That suitcase was going
straight to one place,</i>

101
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.837
<i>right to Kansas City,</i>

102
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.422
<i>which was as close to Las Vegas</i>

103
00:08:08.588 --> 00:08:10.132
<i>as the Midwest bosses could go</i>

104
00:08:10.215 --> 00:08:12.259
<i>without getting arrested.</i>

105
00:08:13.093 --> 00:08:16.388
<i>That suitcase was all the bosses ever wanted</i>

106
00:08:16.471 --> 00:08:19.224
<i>and they wanted it every month.</i>

107
00:08:24.563 --> 00:08:26.523
<i>Now, this old Mormon fuck here,</i>

108
00:08:26.606 --> 00:08:30.360
<i>he had to fly in with suitcases once a
month, nice and easy.</i>

109
00:08:30.444 --> 00:08:31.611
Something smells good.

110
00:08:31.778 --> 00:08:32.946
They made us something to eat.

111
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.157
<i>The bosses came from all over the place,</i>

112
00:08:35.282 --> 00:08:37.451
<i>Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee,</i>

113
00:08:37.534 --> 00:08:39.369
<i>all over the Midwest.</i>

114
00:08:39.578 --> 00:08:42.622
<i>And they would meet in this
produce market in Kansas City.</i>

115
00:08:42.706 --> 00:08:44.374
<i>I mean, nobody even knew it.</i>

116
00:08:44.458 --> 00:08:46.960
<i>One of the guys made his
mother do all the cooking.</i>

117
00:08:47.044 --> 00:08:49.463
<i>You ever see that Jerry Stefano'?</i>

118
00:08:49.546 --> 00:08:53.341
<i>Now, these old grease balls
might not look it, but believe me,</i>

119
00:08:53.425 --> 00:08:56.386
<i>these are the guys who
secretly control Las Vegas.</i>

120
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.055
Mama, that man's here again.

121
00:08:58.138 --> 00:09:00.599
<i>Because they control the Teamsters Union</i>

122
00:09:00.682 --> 00:09:01.975
<i>and that's where you had to go</i>

123
00:09:02.059 --> 00:09:03.852
<i>if you wanted to borrow
money to buy a casino.</i>

124
00:09:06.438 --> 00:09:10.108
<i>Nobody got a Teamsters' loan
unless the guys in this room</i>

125
00:09:10.192 --> 00:09:13.111
<i>knew they were gonna get
their little suitcases.</i>

126
00:09:13.737 --> 00:09:16.907
<i>Guys like this antique over
here, out of Detroit.</i>

127
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.995
<i>Or especially guys like Remo
Gaggi, the outfit's top boss.</i>

128
00:09:22.079 --> 00:09:23.413
You got a round figure on it?

129
00:09:23.497 --> 00:09:25.624
<i>The most important guy in this room.</i>

130
00:09:25.707 --> 00:09:26.917
About 20 pounds. So?

131
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.293
That's around $700,000.

132
00:09:28.418 --> 00:09:29.753
Uh-huh. Good.

133
00:09:30.087 --> 00:09:32.798
I know it's a little early for Las Vegas,

134
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:35.467
but I want to welcome the ladies

135
00:09:35.634 --> 00:09:37.511
and gentlemen of the gaming industry...

136
00:09:37.594 --> 00:09:39.638
<i>As far as the world was concerned,</i>

137
00:09:39.721 --> 00:09:42.557
<i>Andy Stone, the head of the
Teamsters' pension fund,</i>

138
00:09:42.641 --> 00:09:44.768
<i>was a legitimate guy.</i>

139
00:09:45.143 --> 00:09:46.520
<i>A powerful man.</i>

140
00:09:47.521 --> 00:09:49.272
<i>He even played golf with the President.</i>

141
00:09:49.356 --> 00:09:52.609
On behalf of the Teamsters' pension
fund, it's my pleasure...

142
00:09:52.692 --> 00:09:54.361
<i>But Andy also took orders.</i>

143
00:09:54.569 --> 00:09:57.405
<i>And when he was told to give
a loan to Philip Green...</i>

144
00:09:57.489 --> 00:10:02.160
...for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers.

145
00:10:02.869 --> 00:10:04.746
<i>...he did what he was told.</i>

146
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.373
<i>Here was the perfect front man.</i>

147
00:10:06.498 --> 00:10:08.083
<i>What else could he be?</i>

148
00:10:08.166 --> 00:10:10.794
<i>He didn't want to know too much,</i>

149
00:10:11.002 --> 00:10:13.755
<i>especially that the bosses made
the Teamsters lend him the money.</i>

150
00:10:13.839 --> 00:10:15.507
<i>He believed the Teamsters gave him</i>

151
00:10:15.674 --> 00:10:17.342
<i>that money 'cause he was smart.</i>

152
00:10:17.425 --> 00:10:20.887
I know full well how much competition
we have in this great city.

153
00:10:24.558 --> 00:10:26.184
<i>And where they got Green from?</i>

154
00:10:26.309 --> 00:10:27.936
<i>Who the fuck knows?</i>

155
00:10:28.019 --> 00:10:31.022
<i>All I know is that Green
was a real estate hustler,</i>

156
00:10:31.106 --> 00:10:32.732
<i>who barely had enough gas money</i>

157
00:10:32.858 --> 00:10:34.526
<i>to pick up his own fucking check.</i>

158
00:10:35.193 --> 00:10:38.947
<i>And it was the bosses' man, Andy
Stone, who gave all the orders,</i>

159
00:10:39.239 --> 00:10:41.658
<i>not the chairman of the board Philip Green.</i>

160
00:10:41.741 --> 00:10:43.869
I understand. I understand.

161
00:10:47.914 --> 00:10:51.251
<i>Now they needed somebody
they could trust to run the casino.</i>

162
00:10:51.334 --> 00:10:52.878
<i>And who better than Ace?</i>

163
00:10:52.961 --> 00:10:54.880
<i>He was already in Vegas a couple years</i>

164
00:10:55.005 --> 00:10:56.923
<i>and he had the fucking place clocked.</i>

165
00:10:57.632 --> 00:11:00.427
<i>But typical Ace,
give him a shot at running a casino</i>

166
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:01.970
<i>and he tries to talk you out of it.</i>

167
00:11:02.053 --> 00:11:03.805
I don't know if I could do this.

168
00:11:03.889 --> 00:11:05.974
The Gaming Commission would
never give me a license.

169
00:11:06.057 --> 00:11:08.894
I have two dozen gambling
and bookmaking pinches on me.

170
00:11:09.352 --> 00:11:12.647
You don't have to have a
license to work in a casino.

171
00:11:12.731 --> 00:11:14.691
All you gotta do is apply for one.

172
00:11:14.774 --> 00:11:16.985
State law says you can work in a casino

173
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.321
while they're processing your application.

174
00:11:19.404 --> 00:11:21.031
They got a 10-year backlog.

175
00:11:21.114 --> 00:11:22.782
And when they do find out?

176
00:11:22.908 --> 00:11:24.576
Why would they want to find out?

177
00:11:24.659 --> 00:11:26.494
We're putting $100 million into this desert.

178
00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.455
Why lock us out?

179
00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.457
Besides, they'll never find out.

180
00:11:30.582 --> 00:11:32.459
Just keep changing your job title.

181
00:11:32.542 --> 00:11:36.171
Like, from Casino Executive
to Food and Beverage Chairman.

182
00:11:36.254 --> 00:11:40.133
They take your application,
they put it at the bottom of the pile.

183
00:11:40.217 --> 00:11:43.220
I know guys been working there
for 30 years don't have a license.

184
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:47.599
It's a tough proposition, Andy.

185
00:11:47.682 --> 00:11:49.267
If I did it, I'd have to run it my way.

186
00:11:49.392 --> 00:11:50.936
You got it.

187
00:11:51.019 --> 00:11:53.271
I'm serious, no interference.

188
00:11:53.355 --> 00:11:56.399
Nobody's gonna interfere
with you running the casino.

189
00:11:56.483 --> 00:11:57.901
I guarantee it.

190
00:11:57.984 --> 00:12:01.029
<i>Everybody start to sing La-di-da</i>

191
00:12:01.112 --> 00:12:03.615
<i>And that's how they got Ace to take over.</i>

192
00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:07.786
<i>They wanted him because Ace ate,
slept and breathed gambling.</i>

193
00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:13.541
<i>They worked out a real cute job title, too,</i>

194
00:12:13.625 --> 00:12:16.211
<i>Tangiers Public Relations Director.</i>

195
00:12:16.294 --> 00:12:18.964
<i>But the only thing he ever
directed was the casino.</i>

196
00:12:20.131 --> 00:12:24.094
<i>He made his first bet when he
was 15 and he always made money.</i>

197
00:12:24.844 --> 00:12:26.721
<i>But he didn't bet like you or me,</i>

198
00:12:26.846 --> 00:12:28.723
<i>having some fun with it, shit like that.</i>

199
00:12:28.807 --> 00:12:31.101
Where the hell did you learn how to deal?

200
00:12:31.184 --> 00:12:33.645
<i>He bet like a fucking brain surgeon.</i>

201
00:12:33.853 --> 00:12:35.397
Place the checks properly.

202
00:12:35.522 --> 00:12:37.065
That's the way you do it.

203
00:12:37.148 --> 00:12:39.067
<i>He had to know everything.</i>

204
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.861
<i>He'd find out the inside
stuff nobody else knew</i>

205
00:12:41.945 --> 00:12:44.322
<i>and that's what he'd put his money on.</i>

206
00:12:45.907 --> 00:12:49.911
<i>Even back home, years ago,
when we were first hanging out together,</i>

207
00:12:49.995 --> 00:12:52.372
<i>he'd know if the quarterback was on coke...</i>

208
00:12:52.455 --> 00:12:53.915
I'll take Columbia for 20.

209
00:12:53.999 --> 00:12:55.500
<i>...if his girlfriend was knocked up.</i>

210
00:12:56.334 --> 00:12:59.212
<i>He'd get the wind velocity,
so he could judge the field goals.</i>

211
00:13:00.505 --> 00:13:02.215
<i>He even figured out
the different bounce you got</i>

212
00:13:02.299 --> 00:13:05.844
<i>off different kinds of wood they
used on college basketball courts.</i>

213
00:13:05.969 --> 00:13:07.762
<i>He'd work on this shit day and night.</i>

214
00:13:07.846 --> 00:13:10.307
<i>There was nothing about
a game he didn't know.</i>

215
00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:13.018
Ace got down at six. Get me down at six.

216
00:13:14.519 --> 00:13:18.189
<i>Season after season,
the prick was the only winner I ever knew,</i>

217
00:13:18.273 --> 00:13:20.025
<i>but he was so serious about it all,</i>

218
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:21.860
<i>I don't think he ever enjoyed himself.</i>

219
00:13:21.943 --> 00:13:24.237
<i>But that's just the way he was.</i>

220
00:13:25.405 --> 00:13:27.949
<i>But back then, the bosses didn't give a fuck</i>

221
00:13:28.033 --> 00:13:29.659
<i>about if he enjoyed himself or not.</i>

222
00:13:29.743 --> 00:13:32.203
<i>To them, he was a cash register.</i>

223
00:13:32.287 --> 00:13:35.457
<i>All they had to do was ring
the bell and take money.</i>

224
00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.585
<i>Especially Remo,
who was a fucking degenerate gambler</i>

225
00:13:38.668 --> 00:13:39.919
<i>who always lost.</i>

226
00:13:42.005 --> 00:13:43.340
All those fucking sweeps.

227
00:13:43.423 --> 00:13:45.133
<i>I mean, unless Ace made his bets.</i>

228
00:13:45.216 --> 00:13:46.509
Enough now!

229
00:13:47.469 --> 00:13:49.304
<i>Ace made more money for them on a weekend</i>

230
00:13:49.387 --> 00:13:52.015
<i>than I could do heisting joints for a month.</i>

231
00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.894
<i>Whatever Ace picked up on the
street, he told Remo.</i>

232
00:13:56.728 --> 00:13:58.980
<i>I mean, fixed fights, doped horses,</i>

233
00:13:59.064 --> 00:14:02.317
<i>crooked fucking zebras,
locked-in point spreads.</i>

234
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.152
<i>He told fucking Remo everything.</i>

235
00:14:04.235 --> 00:14:06.905
<i>And to tell you the truth,
I don't blame him.</i>

236
00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:10.200
<i>Keeping Remo happy with money</i>

237
00:14:10.283 --> 00:14:12.577
<i>was the greatest
insurance policy in the world.</i>

238
00:14:13.286 --> 00:14:14.829
Son of a bitch!

239
00:14:14.913 --> 00:14:17.165
How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?

240
00:14:17.248 --> 00:14:18.541
Nobody ever had that.

241
00:14:18.666 --> 00:14:19.959
How the hell did you do it?

242
00:14:20.043 --> 00:14:21.920
That's why they paid so well.

243
00:14:22.087 --> 00:14:23.963
You see? He never tells me nothing.

244
00:14:24.047 --> 00:14:26.091
Ace, what do we got on for next week?

245
00:14:26.174 --> 00:14:28.676
Well, it's a little too early.
I'd say Thursday would be good.

246
00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:29.886
Is that all right?

247
00:14:30.011 --> 00:14:32.180
- Okay. You come by the house?
- I'll come by.

248
00:14:32.263 --> 00:14:33.765
- At 7:00.
- 7:00.

249
00:14:34.265 --> 00:14:37.185
Good job, my boy. Keep it up, okay, Ace?

250
00:14:37.644 --> 00:14:39.020
Hey, Nicky.

251
00:14:39.687 --> 00:14:41.356
I'll be right out.

252
00:14:42.273 --> 00:14:43.817
Nicky, see that guy?

253
00:14:43.942 --> 00:14:45.527
Keep a good eye on him.

254
00:14:45.777 --> 00:14:47.654
He's making a lot of money for us

255
00:14:47.737 --> 00:14:49.948
and he's gonna continue
making a lot of money for us,

256
00:14:50.031 --> 00:14:51.199
so keep a good eye on him.

257
00:14:51.282 --> 00:14:53.952
Not like the fucking Feds out
there, without brains.

258
00:14:54.035 --> 00:14:55.495
- Okay?
- All right.

259
00:14:56.454 --> 00:14:58.164
Want me to take this?

260
00:14:58.248 --> 00:15:00.458
<i>Now, on top of everything else,</i>

261
00:15:00.542 --> 00:15:03.211
<i>I gotta make sure nobody
fucks with the Golden Jew.</i>

262
00:15:03.294 --> 00:15:06.047
Chase, couple of shooters for the ladies.

263
00:15:06.464 --> 00:15:08.591
<i>Yeah, we made a great pair.</i>

264
00:15:08.967 --> 00:15:12.387
<i>I made book and Nicky made
sure we always collected.</i>

265
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.931
<i>The old men loved us, and why not?</i>

266
00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:17.058
<i>They all made money with us.</i>

267
00:15:17.142 --> 00:15:19.853
<i>How did Nicky collect? Don't ask.</i>

268
00:15:19.936 --> 00:15:21.896
Where the fuck is the money?

269
00:15:23.481 --> 00:15:25.233
- Hi, Melissa, Heidi.
- Hi, Sam.

270
00:15:26.401 --> 00:15:27.735
Who's this guy?

271
00:15:27.819 --> 00:15:28.862
It was nine. I laid nine.

272
00:15:28.987 --> 00:15:30.071
It was eight.

273
00:15:30.155 --> 00:15:32.866
Ace, tell him the line on the Bear game.

274
00:15:33.241 --> 00:15:34.701
Eight.

275
00:15:34.826 --> 00:15:36.327
If he don't know, nobody knows.

276
00:15:36.411 --> 00:15:37.454
Told you it was eight.

277
00:15:37.579 --> 00:15:38.621
How come I laid nine?

278
00:15:38.705 --> 00:15:40.165
'Cause you're a jag-off.

279
00:15:40.331 --> 00:15:41.749
Excuse me.

280
00:15:41.833 --> 00:15:43.376
- What?
- Is this yours?

281
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.129
Yeah, that's my pen. Why?

282
00:15:46.212 --> 00:15:48.173
It's a nice pen. I didn't know whose it was.

283
00:15:48.298 --> 00:15:50.216
I didn't want it to get lost.

284
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.802
Well, thank you. Why don't you take that pen

285
00:15:52.927 --> 00:15:55.430
and shove it up your ass, fucking jag-off?

286
00:15:57.474 --> 00:15:59.517
- I was just...
- Fucking asshole.

287
00:15:59.601 --> 00:16:01.102
Look out, Joe.

288
00:16:22.081 --> 00:16:24.542
What's that? You hear
a little girl, Frankie?

289
00:16:24.709 --> 00:16:27.170
Hear a little girl, Ace?
Is that a little girl?

290
00:16:27.337 --> 00:16:28.838
What happened to the fucking tough guy

291
00:16:28.922 --> 00:16:30.882
told my friend to stick it
up his fucking ass?

292
00:16:31.508 --> 00:16:33.968
Nicky, take it easy. Nicky.

293
00:16:41.518 --> 00:16:44.646
<i>While I was trying to figure
out why the guy was saying this,</i>

294
00:16:44.729 --> 00:16:46.314
<i>Nicky just hit him.</i>

295
00:16:46.397 --> 00:16:49.817
<i>No matter how big a guy was,
Nicky would take him on.</i>

296
00:16:49.901 --> 00:16:53.238
<i>You beat Nicky with fists,
he comes back with a bat.</i>

297
00:16:53.363 --> 00:16:56.699
<i>You beat him with a knife,
he comes back with a gun.</i>

298
00:16:56.824 --> 00:16:59.661
<i>And if you beat him with a
gun, you better kill him,</i>

299
00:16:59.744 --> 00:17:04.082
<i>because he'll keep coming back
and back until one of you is dead.</i>

300
00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:15.468
<i>Listen, with me protecting Ace,</i>

301
00:17:15.593 --> 00:17:17.595
<i>he made a fortune for the bosses.</i>

302
00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:21.599
<i>I mean, that's what got him to Vegas.</i>

303
00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.727
<i>He was a money machine.</i>

304
00:17:25.478 --> 00:17:27.981
<i>A tremendous earner for these guys.</i>

305
00:17:28.106 --> 00:17:31.526
<i>As soon as he took over,
he doubled the fucking drop.</i>

306
00:17:32.193 --> 00:17:34.821
<i>With Ace,
the casino never saw so much money.</i>

307
00:17:35.238 --> 00:17:36.698
<i>And the bosses, they couldn't be happier.</i>

308
00:17:38.241 --> 00:17:39.909
<i>I got seven hundred dollars</i>

309
00:17:39.993 --> 00:17:42.078
<i>And don't you mess with me</i>

310
00:17:42.161 --> 00:17:44.539
<i>But you know I'm here</i>

311
00:17:47.041 --> 00:17:50.253
<i>Everybody knows I'm here</i>

312
00:17:55.133 --> 00:17:59.012
<i>In Vegas, I had to keep a few
juiced-in local cowboys working.</i>

313
00:17:59.095 --> 00:18:01.806
<i>They were close to the,
you know, good old boys.</i>

314
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.019
<i>Without us, these guys,
they'd still be shoveling mule shit.</i>

315
00:18:06.102 --> 00:18:07.895
You gotta keep a cleaner station.

316
00:18:08.021 --> 00:18:09.814
If you need Mr. Clean, page him, all right?

317
00:18:09.897 --> 00:18:11.441
Won't happen again, Sam.

318
00:18:11.524 --> 00:18:13.484
Mr. Rothstein.

319
00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:15.570
Won't happen again, Mr. Rothstein.

320
00:18:15.653 --> 00:18:17.071
Is this guy just a dumb fucking white man?

321
00:18:17.196 --> 00:18:18.656
What's the story?

322
00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:19.824
You need him.

323
00:18:19.991 --> 00:18:21.075
I can't get rid of him?

324
00:18:21.159 --> 00:18:23.286
He's the County Commissioner's cousin.

325
00:18:23.411 --> 00:18:25.538
I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.

326
00:18:25.622 --> 00:18:27.832
<i>I had no choice, I had to take care of them.</i>

327
00:18:27.957 --> 00:18:29.834
<i>These yokels ran the state.</i>

328
00:18:31.252 --> 00:18:33.921
<i>They passed the laws, they owned the courts.</i>

329
00:18:34.005 --> 00:18:35.840
- Hey, I need a room.
- Good to see you.

330
00:18:35.923 --> 00:18:39.594
<i>I had dozens of politicians and
officials in that place every week.</i>

331
00:18:39.677 --> 00:18:41.679
Get the Senator whatever he wants.

332
00:18:41.763 --> 00:18:43.723
<i>Why not make them happy?</i>

333
00:18:44.265 --> 00:18:46.267
...the Presidential suite.

334
00:18:55.151 --> 00:18:58.279
<i>For politicians like
our state senator up there,</i>

335
00:18:58.363 --> 00:19:00.114
<i>everything was on the house.</i>

336
00:19:00.198 --> 00:19:02.575
<i>These guys won their comp
life when they got elected,</i>

337
00:19:02.659 --> 00:19:04.994
<i>so why not take advantage of it?</i>

338
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:09.374
<i>Still, the politicians came
cheap, we could handle them.</i>

339
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.710
<i>It's a whale like K.K. lchikawa</i>

340
00:19:12.835 --> 00:19:15.046
<i>who plays $30,000 a hand in baccarat,</i>

341
00:19:15.129 --> 00:19:17.090
<i>that's the one you gotta watch.</i>

342
00:19:17.173 --> 00:19:19.509
<i>He plays fast and big, and he has the cash</i>

343
00:19:19.634 --> 00:19:21.969
<i>and the credit to turn out your lights.</i>

344
00:19:22.053 --> 00:19:25.640
<i>A year ago, he cleaned out a couple
of casinos in the Cayman Islands.</i>

345
00:19:26.391 --> 00:19:28.518
<i>Downstairs he takes us for $2 million</i>

346
00:19:28.601 --> 00:19:32.230
<i>and upstairs he takes free
soap, shampoo and towels.</i>

347
00:19:32.814 --> 00:19:35.983
<i>A billionaire cheapskate
who loved his free rooms,</i>

348
00:19:36.067 --> 00:19:39.153
<i>free private jets
and $2 million of our money.</i>

349
00:19:40.905 --> 00:19:42.156
<i>But we got him back.</i>

350
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.742
<i>I had our pilot tell him
the plane was on the fritz.</i>

351
00:19:44.826 --> 00:19:46.452
I don't know what went wrong.

352
00:19:46.577 --> 00:19:48.204
I'm awfully sorry. I can't understand it.

353
00:19:48.287 --> 00:19:50.248
These mechanical things happen.

354
00:19:50.373 --> 00:19:52.291
Hey, but better here than up there.

355
00:19:52.875 --> 00:19:55.336
<i>He missed the commercial flights to Japan.</i>

356
00:19:55.461 --> 00:19:56.587
I can't believe it...

357
00:19:56.713 --> 00:19:57.797
What can I do?

358
00:20:02.802 --> 00:20:06.264
<i>We got him back with a
whole floor of rooms to himself.</i>

359
00:20:06.597 --> 00:20:07.807
I am sorry.

360
00:20:07.932 --> 00:20:09.183
Maybe, you get my money back.

361
00:20:09.267 --> 00:20:10.893
No, no gambling.

362
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.649
<i>And once he was back, he played small.</i>

363
00:20:19.527 --> 00:20:22.989
<i>He bet $1,000 a hand instead
of his usual $30,000 a hand.</i>

364
00:20:23.072 --> 00:20:26.033
...to the bank with
a natural eight over a five.

365
00:20:26.701 --> 00:20:29.537
<i>But I knew the trick
with whales like lchikawa</i>

366
00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.248
<i>was that they can't bet small for long.</i>

367
00:20:32.331 --> 00:20:34.417
<i>He didn't think of it as winning $10,000,</i>

368
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.961
<i>he thought of it as losing $90,000.</i>

369
00:20:37.879 --> 00:20:39.756
<i>So he upped his bets.</i>

370
00:20:43.801 --> 00:20:45.970
<i>Until he dropped his winnings back</i>

371
00:20:46.095 --> 00:20:48.264
<i>and gave up $1 million of his own cash.</i>

372
00:20:50.975 --> 00:20:53.144
<i>In a casino, the cardinal
rule is to keep them</i>

373
00:20:53.269 --> 00:20:55.396
<i>playing and keep them coming back.</i>

374
00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.440
<i>The longer they play, the more they lose.</i>

375
00:20:57.523 --> 00:20:58.983
<i>In the end, we get it all.</i>

376
00:21:00.485 --> 00:21:01.736
<i>God damn it</i>

377
00:21:01.819 --> 00:21:04.572
<i>Trying to make it real compared to what?</i>

378
00:21:06.199 --> 00:21:08.201
<i>Sock it to me</i>

379
00:21:09.619 --> 00:21:12.747
<i>In Vegas,
everybody's gotta watch everybody else.</i>

380
00:21:13.456 --> 00:21:15.875
Six. Who's gonna give me that?

381
00:21:15.958 --> 00:21:19.128
<i>Since the players are
looking to beat the casino,</i>

382
00:21:19.921 --> 00:21:21.881
<i>the dealers are watching the players.</i>

383
00:21:21.964 --> 00:21:23.174
Six!

384
00:21:23.299 --> 00:21:24.425
Make the Six.

385
00:21:24.509 --> 00:21:27.094
<i>The box men are watching the dealers.</i>

386
00:21:27.178 --> 00:21:29.764
<i>The floor men are watching the box men.</i>

387
00:21:30.097 --> 00:21:32.850
<i>The pit bosses are watching the floor men.</i>

388
00:21:33.184 --> 00:21:35.937
<i>The shift bosses
are watching the pit bosses.</i>

389
00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:38.940
<i>The casino manager
is watching the shift bosses.</i>

390
00:21:39.023 --> 00:21:41.192
<i>I'm watching the casino manager.</i>

391
00:21:41.275 --> 00:21:44.529
<i>And the eye in the sky is watching us all.</i>

392
00:21:48.616 --> 00:21:52.161
<i>Plus, we had a dozen guys up
there, most of them ex-cheats,</i>

393
00:21:52.245 --> 00:21:54.580
<i>who knew every trick in the house.</i>

394
00:22:02.213 --> 00:22:04.966
<i>Trying to make it real compared to what?</i>

395
00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.395
- Yes!
- Thank you. Very nice.

396
00:22:17.478 --> 00:22:19.188
I told you I was hot tonight.

397
00:22:31.284 --> 00:22:33.244
Looking good.

398
00:22:33.327 --> 00:22:35.538
Let's go, this is for Ginger.

399
00:22:35.621 --> 00:22:37.248
Let me have $100 on the hard 10.

400
00:22:37.415 --> 00:22:39.041
Thank you.

401
00:22:39.417 --> 00:22:40.418
Hard 10.

402
00:22:40.585 --> 00:22:41.586
<i>Here we go now.</i>

403
00:22:52.096 --> 00:22:53.222
Oh, I'm sorry.

404
00:22:53.347 --> 00:22:54.432
Sorry, the dice.

405
00:22:56.767 --> 00:22:58.060
Thank you very much.

406
00:22:58.185 --> 00:22:59.478
Thank you very much.

407
00:22:59.937 --> 00:23:01.022
Thank you, sir.

408
00:23:01.147 --> 00:23:02.273
You were great.

409
00:23:02.356 --> 00:23:04.191
Take care, Steve. Take chances, drive fast.

410
00:23:04.317 --> 00:23:06.193
Thank you very much.

411
00:23:06.277 --> 00:23:08.070
Ginger, honey, this is for you, love.

412
00:23:08.195 --> 00:23:09.989
Thanks for your time.

413
00:23:10.281 --> 00:23:11.282
Come on.

414
00:23:11.407 --> 00:23:12.408
What's the matter?

415
00:23:13.367 --> 00:23:16.329
I made a lot of money for
you, I want my cut.

416
00:23:16.621 --> 00:23:18.289
I've seen you stealing from me.

417
00:23:18.456 --> 00:23:20.124
Look at the stack of chips.

418
00:23:20.207 --> 00:23:21.334
I want my half.

419
00:23:21.459 --> 00:23:22.585
I was watching you all night.

420
00:23:22.668 --> 00:23:23.794
I want my money.

421
00:23:23.961 --> 00:23:25.087
Your bag is full of chips.

422
00:23:25.171 --> 00:23:26.714
I didn't steal anything from you.

423
00:23:26.839 --> 00:23:28.382
Get lost, Ginger. Get lost!

424
00:23:28.466 --> 00:23:30.051
- Get lost?
- Yes.

425
00:23:30.259 --> 00:23:31.302
Well, how about that?

426
00:23:31.469 --> 00:23:32.511
Come on!

427
00:23:35.932 --> 00:23:38.392
<i>Slippin' and a slidin', peepin' and a hidin'</i>

428
00:23:38.476 --> 00:23:40.519
<i>Been told a long time ago</i>

429
00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:43.439
<i>I've been told baby you've been bold</i>

430
00:23:43.522 --> 00:23:45.816
<i>I won't be no fool no more</i>

431
00:23:52.698 --> 00:23:55.242
<i>Baby</i>

432
00:23:55.576 --> 00:23:58.496
<i>on, baby</i>

433
00:23:59.455 --> 00:24:02.458
<i>My sweet baby</i>

434
00:24:03.584 --> 00:24:05.670
<i>You're the one</i>

435
00:24:24.146 --> 00:24:27.024
<i>What a move. I fell in love right there.</i>

436
00:24:27.358 --> 00:24:31.028
<i>But in Vegas, for a girl like
Ginger, love costs money.</i>

437
00:24:32.363 --> 00:24:34.782
<i>What's different about her</i>

438
00:24:34.865 --> 00:24:36.701
<i>I don't really know</i>

439
00:24:36.784 --> 00:24:38.744
I'm gonna go powder my nose.

440
00:24:40.871 --> 00:24:43.124
<i>No matter how I try</i>

441
00:24:44.709 --> 00:24:46.877
<i>I just can't make her cry</i>

442
00:24:49.672 --> 00:24:51.799
<i>Singer's mission in life was money.</i>

443
00:24:51.882 --> 00:24:53.467
I'll be right back.

444
00:24:53.551 --> 00:24:54.927
Okay, thanks for asking.

445
00:24:55.011 --> 00:24:56.804
<i>She was a queen around the casino.</i>

446
00:24:56.887 --> 00:25:00.266
<i>She brought in high rollers and
helped them spend a lot of money.</i>

447
00:25:00.641 --> 00:25:01.726
Hello.

448
00:25:01.851 --> 00:25:02.893
Hey, Ginger, how you doing?

449
00:25:02.977 --> 00:25:04.228
Great. I have something for you.

450
00:25:04.395 --> 00:25:05.646
You got me covered?

451
00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:07.148
And you do. Thank you very much.

452
00:25:07.273 --> 00:25:08.691
Take care.

453
00:25:09.066 --> 00:25:10.401
I got some lucky pills for you.

454
00:25:10.526 --> 00:25:11.819
Yeah.

455
00:25:11.902 --> 00:25:14.655
<i>Who didn't want Ginger?
She was one of the best known,</i>

456
00:25:14.739 --> 00:25:17.783
<i>best liked and most
respected hustlers in town.</i>

457
00:25:21.954 --> 00:25:25.124
<i>She could keep a guy awake
for two or three days</i>

458
00:25:25.207 --> 00:25:26.500
<i>before sending him home broke</i>

459
00:25:26.584 --> 00:25:29.420
<i>to the little woman and his bank examiners.</i>

460
00:25:44.101 --> 00:25:45.478
Any change?

461
00:25:46.604 --> 00:25:50.232
Oh, I hit a few games on the way back.

462
00:25:51.776 --> 00:25:54.987
<i>That was all bullshit,
she just pocketed the cash.</i>

463
00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:59.116
- How you doing tonight?
- Good.

464
00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.160
- Beat.
- How are you?

465
00:26:01.243 --> 00:26:02.953
<i>Ginger had the hustlers' code.</i>

466
00:26:03.037 --> 00:26:04.163
Take one for you.

467
00:26:04.288 --> 00:26:05.414
Thank you.

468
00:26:05.498 --> 00:26:07.625
<i>She knew how to take care of people</i>

469
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.835
<i>and that's what Vegas is all about.</i>

470
00:26:10.044 --> 00:26:11.253
$6,800.

471
00:26:11.378 --> 00:26:12.588
Thanks.

472
00:26:12.671 --> 00:26:13.881
<i>It's kickback city.</i>

473
00:26:13.964 --> 00:26:15.591
- Have a good night.
- Thank you. You, too.

474
00:26:21.138 --> 00:26:22.640
<i>She took care of the dealers, pit bosses...</i>

475
00:26:22.807 --> 00:26:24.350
Hey, Mitch.

476
00:26:24.433 --> 00:26:26.310
<i>...floor managers, but mostly,</i>

477
00:26:26.435 --> 00:26:28.312
<i>she took care of the valet Parkers.</i>

478
00:26:28.395 --> 00:26:31.649
<i>The guys who could get you
anything and take care of anything.</i>

479
00:26:31.732 --> 00:26:33.526
<i>Ginger took care of the Parkers</i>

480
00:26:33.651 --> 00:26:35.486
<i>because they took care of
the security guards,</i>

481
00:26:35.569 --> 00:26:38.197
<i>who took care of the cops,
who let her operate.</i>

482
00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.490
I need that stuff tonight.

483
00:26:39.615 --> 00:26:40.783
No problem.

484
00:26:40.866 --> 00:26:42.409
You are a doll.

485
00:26:42.493 --> 00:26:44.829
<i>The valet parking job
was such a money-maker,</i>

486
00:26:44.912 --> 00:26:48.207
<i>they had to pay off the hotel
manager just to get the concession.</i>

487
00:26:50.084 --> 00:26:52.253
<i>But one thing I could never understand</i>

488
00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:55.131
<i>was that she could have
everything under control</i>

489
00:26:55.214 --> 00:26:57.758
<i>except for her old pimp
boyfriend, Lester Diamond.</i>

490
00:26:57.842 --> 00:27:01.345
Gin, you know I got other people in
this, I got partners.

491
00:27:01.428 --> 00:27:02.429
I want you to understand

492
00:27:02.513 --> 00:27:05.141
that I am looking out for you
in this thing. Okay?

493
00:27:05.349 --> 00:27:09.228
You're gonna get yours back and
you're gonna get back first. Okay?

494
00:27:09.311 --> 00:27:10.479
All right, yeah.

495
00:27:10.604 --> 00:27:11.772
Where you going?

496
00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:14.525
Where are you? You're in that place.

497
00:27:14.608 --> 00:27:16.527
- I'm here.
- No, you're not.

498
00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:19.446
Where are you? Where are you?

499
00:27:19.613 --> 00:27:21.532
I'm always here for you.

500
00:27:22.783 --> 00:27:24.827
- You're my woman.
- I know.

501
00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:29.206
<i>The Ginger!
knew wouldn't even look at this creep.</i>

502
00:27:29.874 --> 00:27:31.542
- Yeah.
- Good luck.

503
00:27:31.876 --> 00:27:34.128
<i>He was a moocher, a card cheat,</i>

504
00:27:34.253 --> 00:27:36.547
<i>a country club golf hustler, a scumbag,</i>

00:27:36.839 --> 00:27:37.965
<i>chasing dentists for a few bucks.</i>

506
00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:39.216
Careful.

507
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.927
<i>The guy was always broke,
he always had a story,</i>

508

<i>and she could never turn him down.</i>

509
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:47.808
<i>The way Ginger saw it was that
Lester was just an unlucky guy.</i>

510
00:27:47.892 --> 00:27:50.102
<i>Somebody had to take care of him.</i>

511
00:27:50.853 --> 00:27:53.063
<i>But nobody had to take care of Nicky.</i>

512
00:27:53.689 --> 00:27:56.025
If you find any cash,
we'll whack it up with you.

513
00:27:56.108 --> 00:27:58.569
<i>He took care of himself only too well.</i>

514
00:27:58.861 --> 00:28:01.322
<i>That's why every badge back
home wanted to nail him.</i>

515
00:28:01.405 --> 00:28:03.240
I folded these things beautifully

516
00:28:03.365 --> 00:28:05.159
and I would appreciate a little respect.

517
00:28:05.284 --> 00:28:08.495
- Jesus Christ.
- Don't look at me, pal, I gotta live with her.

518
00:28:08.579 --> 00:28:11.332
<i>Even after a vacation,
they hassled him at the airport.</i>

519
00:28:11.415 --> 00:28:14.335
<i>Frank Marino was there to meet
him but so were the cops.</i>

520
00:28:14.418 --> 00:28:18.255
<i>This time they wanted him for
some diamond burglary in Antwerp.</i>

521
00:28:18.339 --> 00:28:20.799
<i>They were ready to blame him for anything.</i>

522
00:28:20.883 --> 00:28:22.134
Put your things away.

523
00:28:22.218 --> 00:28:23.552
<i>They were usually right.</i>

524
00:28:23.636 --> 00:28:24.762
Hold it.

525
00:28:24.845 --> 00:28:26.305
<i>Nicky enjoyed being a gangster</i>

526
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:27.932
<i>and he didn't give a damn who knew it.</i>

527
00:28:28.015 --> 00:28:31.727
Come on. There we go. Look. Beautiful!

528
00:28:32.645 --> 00:28:34.897
<i>That's what worried me 'cause it turns out</i>

529
00:28:35.022 --> 00:28:37.274
<i>Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.</i>

530
00:28:37.358 --> 00:28:39.235
- Right, we're clear.
- There's more.

531
00:28:39.318 --> 00:28:40.986
- I think that's it.
- There's more.

532
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:43.322
There's a couple stuck in there.

533
00:28:43.405 --> 00:28:45.032
- I'm telling you, they're out!
- Come on.

534
00:28:45.115 --> 00:28:48.577
Don't get so defensive,
it could be stuck in your hair.

535
00:28:48.869 --> 00:28:50.454
Oh, there aren't?

536
00:28:50.621 --> 00:28:52.206
What's that, huh? What's that?

537
00:28:52.289 --> 00:28:54.458
There's no more. Thanks, hon.

538
00:28:54.625 --> 00:28:57.628
<i>I couldn't wait to get my hands on Vegas.</i>

539
00:28:57.711 --> 00:29:00.422
<i>But the bosses didn't send
me there to have a good time.</i>

540
00:29:00.506 --> 00:29:03.592
<i>They sent me to make sure
that nobody fucked with Ace</i>

541
00:29:03.676 --> 00:29:06.637
<i>and nobody interfered with the fucking skim.</i>

542
00:29:08.138 --> 00:29:09.139
Hey.

543
00:29:09.223 --> 00:29:10.224
How you doing?

544
00:29:10.975 --> 00:29:12.685
Hey, Sammy.

545
00:29:13.477 --> 00:29:16.981
- Boy, look at this place, huh?
- All right. Incredible.

546
00:29:17.231 --> 00:29:20.442
- Welcome to Vegas. Something, huh?
- Okay, Sammy. Yeah.

547
00:29:21.694 --> 00:29:22.987
Ginger.

548
00:29:27.408 --> 00:29:30.119
Holy shit. What you been doing out here?

549
00:29:30.202 --> 00:29:31.620
Honey, come here.

550
00:29:33.872 --> 00:29:36.125
This is Jennifer and Nick,
dear friends of mine.

551
00:29:36.208 --> 00:29:38.085
- Hi, Jennifer.
- A pleasure.

552
00:29:38.168 --> 00:29:39.837
Pleased to meet you.

553
00:29:40.504 --> 00:29:41.839
Okay, Sammy.

554
00:29:42.339 --> 00:29:44.508
<i>After we ate,
we left Jennifer and Ginger alone</i>

555
00:29:44.633 --> 00:29:46.760
<i>and we took a ride to talk.</i>

556
00:29:47.011 --> 00:29:49.346
<i>And then he hit me with it.</i>

557
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:52.349
What do you think about me moving out here?

558
00:29:54.351 --> 00:29:55.853
You got a problem with that?

559
00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.521
Of course not.

560
00:29:58.314 --> 00:30:00.441
You mean, I have your permission?

561
00:30:00.524 --> 00:30:04.570
Sure, you have my permission but I gotta tell
you, it's no joke out here.

562
00:30:04.653 --> 00:30:06.780
You gotta keep a low profile.

563
00:30:06.864 --> 00:30:08.282
It's not like back home.

564
00:30:08.407 --> 00:30:09.783
They don't like guys like us.

565
00:30:09.867 --> 00:30:11.785
And this sheriff's a real cowboy.

566
00:30:11.869 --> 00:30:14.538
Even the coppers
bury people out in the desert.

567
00:30:14.621 --> 00:30:15.914
I don't care.

568
00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.374
I wanna get away from back home.

569
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:19.585
I'm tired of that shit back there.

570
00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:21.545
Look at this place, it's made of money.

571
00:30:21.628 --> 00:30:23.339
You know the best part?

572
00:30:23.464 --> 00:30:25.132
Nobody's gonna know what we're doing.

573
00:30:25.215 --> 00:30:27.634
There's nobody here to see us.

574
00:30:27.718 --> 00:30:30.471
Nick, I got pinched twice for no reason.

575
00:30:30.554 --> 00:30:32.056
You really gotta be careful.

576
00:30:32.139 --> 00:30:34.767
I'm running a licensed place,
everything's legit.

577
00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:36.060
Don't worry about it.

578
00:30:36.226 --> 00:30:37.478
I'm not gonna do anything.

579
00:30:37.561 --> 00:30:40.564
I'm especially not gonna
involve you in anything.

580
00:30:43.734 --> 00:30:45.486
<i>Ace saw Vegas one way.</i>

581
00:30:45.569 --> 00:30:46.570
You tell this guy I'm coming?

582
00:30:46.653 --> 00:30:47.654
Course.

583
00:30:47.738 --> 00:30:51.867
<i>But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched.</i>

584
00:30:53.994 --> 00:30:58.082
<i>They had bookies, pimps,
and drug dealers I could shake down.</i>

585
00:30:58.165 --> 00:31:00.000
<i>Who the fuck were they gonna run to?</i>

586
00:31:00.125 --> 00:31:01.960
<i>So I started getting everybody in line.</i>

587
00:31:02.044 --> 00:31:04.755
<i>Best of all, for the first time in my life,</i>

588
00:31:04.838 --> 00:31:07.257
I figured out & way not to lose.

589
00:31:07.424 --> 00:31:09.385
<i>Yeah, he had a foolproof scheme.</i>

590
00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:11.512
<i>It wasn't very scientific but it worked.</i>

591
00:31:11.595 --> 00:31:13.472
<i>When he won, he collected, when he lost,</i>

592
00:31:13.597 --> 00:31:15.516
<i>he told the bookies to fuck themselves.</i>

593
00:31:15.599 --> 00:31:17.267
<i>What were they gonna do, muscle Nicky?</i>

594
00:31:17.434 --> 00:31:19.103
<i>Nicky was the muscle.</i>

595
00:31:19.186 --> 00:31:20.270
Tony. How you doing?

596
00:31:20.396 --> 00:31:21.480
Hey. How you doing?

597
00:31:21.563 --> 00:31:22.981
Good. You got that thing for me?

598
00:31:23.107 --> 00:31:24.608
What thing?

599
00:31:24.775 --> 00:31:26.860
Oh, Nicky, I thought you was laying.

600
00:31:26.944 --> 00:31:28.278
I was laying? No, no, I'm taking.

601
00:31:28.445 --> 00:31:29.780
I was taking.

602
00:31:29.863 --> 00:31:31.907
- You sure?
- I'm positive.

603
00:31:32.783 --> 00:31:34.326
I'm a little confused.

604
00:31:34.451 --> 00:31:36.036
You're a little confused?

605
00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.163
Maybe if I stick your fucking face

606
00:31:38.288 --> 00:31:40.374
through this window, you'll get unconfused.

607
00:31:40.457 --> 00:31:41.792
Give me the money.

608
00:31:41.917 --> 00:31:43.252
Sorry. I didn't mean anything by it.

609
00:31:43.335 --> 00:31:45.129
Yeah. That's why you had it ready.

610
00:31:45.254 --> 00:31:47.047
My fucking head.

611
00:31:47.131 --> 00:31:48.882
- Fucking head, huh?
- Smarten up.

612
00:31:48.966 --> 00:31:50.259
Don't fuck around, Tony.

613
00:31:50.342 --> 00:31:53.887
Now Nicholas Santoro will tell
us about our first President.

614
00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:00.811
George Washington was born...

615
00:32:00.894 --> 00:32:03.730
<i>But still, it was nice
and quiet for a while.</i>

616
00:32:03.814 --> 00:32:05.649
<i>Ginger and I presented Nicky and Jennifer</i>

617
00:32:05.732 --> 00:32:08.277
<i>all over town like
regular Ozzie and Harriets.</i>

618
00:32:09.987 --> 00:32:11.363
Beautiful swing.

619
00:32:11.447 --> 00:32:14.575
<i>Ace got my son, little
Nicky, involved in Little League.</i>

620
00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:16.410
<i>Turned out one of the other coaches</i>

621
00:32:16.535 --> 00:32:18.245
was a fucking Metro Intelligence cop.

622
00:32:18.328 --> 00:32:20.831
<i>But it didn't matter,
it was all about the kids.</i>

623
00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:23.417
He's gotta realize
everything can't be a home run.

624
00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.085
That's exactly what I tell him.

625
00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:26.837
But that's the kind of kid he is.

626
00:32:29.089 --> 00:32:32.426
<i>And Nicky, being Nicky,
he made his presence known.</i>

627
00:32:32.843 --> 00:32:35.971
<i>Especially at the casino,
where he definitely did not work,</i>

628
00:32:36.054 --> 00:32:37.598
<i>people got the message.</i>

629
00:32:37.681 --> 00:32:40.476
<i>That's why the bosses sent me out here.</i>

630
00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:43.395
<i>They wanted me to make sure
nobody robbed the joint.</i>

631
00:32:43.479 --> 00:32:45.814
<i>Like these two fucking balloon heads.</i>

632
00:32:45.898 --> 00:32:48.734
<i>They were gonna try to bang
us out of 200 fucking grand.</i>

633
00:32:48.817 --> 00:32:50.694
<i>Yeah, right, I'm sure.</i>

634
00:32:50.777 --> 00:32:52.196
How are you? What are you doing here?

635
00:32:52.321 --> 00:32:53.739
I'm over here now.

636
00:32:53.822 --> 00:32:55.157
Over here?

637
00:32:55.282 --> 00:32:56.617
Yeah, with them.

638
00:33:01.371 --> 00:33:02.915
We're waiting on Carmine.

639
00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.583
Yeah, we're looking for Carmine.

640
00:33:04.666 --> 00:33:06.335
He was here before.

641
00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:08.170
He had a suitcase and then he left.

642
00:33:08.337 --> 00:33:09.379
Carmine left?

643
00:33:09.505 --> 00:33:10.547
Carmine left?

644
00:33:12.758 --> 00:33:14.134
He's gone?

645
00:33:14.718 --> 00:33:16.220
He's not here?

646
00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:21.308
Carmine's out?

647
00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:25.312
I think maybe he went across
the street or somewhere.

648
00:33:28.315 --> 00:33:31.151
Well, listen, good luck with the joint.

649
00:33:31.235 --> 00:33:32.236
Thanks, Eddy.

650
00:33:32.319 --> 00:33:33.320
Yeah. Lots of luck.

651
00:33:34.071 --> 00:33:35.489
Good luck to you, too.

652
00:33:35.614 --> 00:33:37.074
They forgot to sign their papers.

653
00:33:38.116 --> 00:33:40.410
Yeah, they don't need those anymore.

654
00:33:40.786 --> 00:33:44.206
<i>Out of respect,
guys from other crews got a warning.</i>

655
00:33:44.289 --> 00:33:46.375
<i>Everybody else, watch out.</i>

656
00:33:47.918 --> 00:33:51.672
<i>Like these yokels here,
who never heard of Nicky or the bosses,</i>

657
00:33:51.755 --> 00:33:54.299
<i>'cause they're the morons who
give you the most trouble.</i>

658
00:33:54.383 --> 00:33:55.634
<i>Even after we catch them,</i>

659
00:33:55.717 --> 00:33:58.929
<i>they try sneaking back with
beards and wigs and fake noses.</i>

660
00:34:00.722 --> 00:34:03.767
<i>You can spot these assholes
by watching the way they bet.</i>

661
00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:06.186
<i>Like this guy, he's betting lavender chips</i>

662
00:34:06.311 --> 00:34:08.689
<i>at $500 each with only one little problem,</i>

663
00:34:08.814 --> 00:34:10.816
<i>he's always guessed right.</i>

664
00:34:13.777 --> 00:34:15.487
<i>If he wasn't so fucking greedy,</i>

665
00:34:15.612 --> 00:34:17.364
<i>he'd have been tougher to spot.</i>

666
00:34:17.447 --> 00:34:19.866
<i>But in the end, they're all greedy.</i>

667
00:34:24.454 --> 00:34:27.040
<i>I got a feeling about the future</i>

668
00:34:27.749 --> 00:34:30.168
<i>And it ain't too good, I know that</i>

669
00:34:36.842 --> 00:34:39.928
<i>I saw that the dealer was
weak but he wasn't in on it.</i>

670
00:34:40.012 --> 00:34:42.306
<i>He just wasn't protecting his hand.</i>

671
00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:45.142
<i>He was lifting his hole card way too high.</i>

672
00:34:57.362 --> 00:35:00.574
<i>Here's this guy
reading the dealer's hole card</i>

673
00:35:00.657 --> 00:35:03.577
<i>and signaling his buddy at this table.</i>

674
00:35:11.835 --> 00:35:13.920
<i>That's just what these hustlers look for.</i>

675
00:35:14.004 --> 00:35:17.215
<i>They cruise the casinos
looking for weak dealers</i>

676
00:35:17.299 --> 00:35:19.843
<i>the way lions look for weak antelope.</i>

677
00:35:23.388 --> 00:35:25.098
Operator, this is Mr. R.

678
00:35:25.182 --> 00:35:27.851
Get me Armstrong and Friday
at Pit 2 right away.

679
00:35:45.661 --> 00:35:47.788
BJ 19, second base, the beard.

680
00:35:49.206 --> 00:35:52.042
Operator, I need Mr. Happy. Loud.

681
00:35:53.043 --> 00:35:56.880
Happy birthday to you

682
00:35:57.339 --> 00:36:01.051
Happy birthday to you

683
00:36:01.176 --> 00:36:05.889
Happy birthday, dear Jack

684
00:36:06.056 --> 00:36:09.893
Happy birthday to you

685
00:36:29.746 --> 00:36:31.039
Man down!

686
00:36:32.249 --> 00:36:33.667
Go get medical.

687
00:36:33.792 --> 00:36:35.252
We got a cardiac arrest here.

688
00:36:35.502 --> 00:36:37.045
He's fine, folks.

689
00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:38.714
Just give us some room, please.

690
00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:42.008
Watch yourselves.

691
00:36:42.467 --> 00:36:45.470
<i>They never know what hit them
and if and when they do find out</i>

692
00:36:45.554 --> 00:36:47.681
<i>that they got zapped by a cattle prod,</i>

693
00:36:47.806 --> 00:36:49.975
<i>they wish they really
did have a heart attack.</i>

694
00:36:54.604 --> 00:36:56.690
<i>Turns out this guy and his pals</i>

695
00:36:56.815 --> 00:36:58.859
<i>were knocking this place dead for years.</i>

696
00:36:58.942 --> 00:37:00.861
- He's got a wire.
- What are you doing?

697
00:37:01.486 --> 00:37:03.363
- There it is.
- That's it.

698
00:37:03.447 --> 00:37:05.365
- Cheater's justice.
- Oh, God!

699
00:37:07.117 --> 00:37:10.078
Please, no, no. No!

700
00:37:10.162 --> 00:37:13.707
<i>I wanted everybody to know that
things were changed around here.</i>

701
00:37:14.458 --> 00:37:18.587
<i>We had to make an example of these
pricks that the party was over.</i>

702
00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:22.674
I'm curious. I saw you shuffling
your checks with your right hand.

703
00:37:22.883 --> 00:37:24.134
Can you do that with both hands?

704
00:37:24.259 --> 00:37:25.469
No.

705
00:37:26.052 --> 00:37:27.846
- You can't?
- No, sir.

706
00:37:28.847 --> 00:37:30.432
Can you do it with your left hand?

707
00:37:30.557 --> 00:37:32.142
I never tried.

708
00:37:32.309 --> 00:37:33.643
So, you're a righty?

709
00:37:33.769 --> 00:37:35.103
Yeah.

710
00:37:40.108 --> 00:37:41.568
God!

711
00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:46.948
Now, you're gonna have to
learn with your left hand.

712
00:37:47.449 --> 00:37:48.825
It's $100,000, $110,000, I think.

713
00:37:48.992 --> 00:37:50.368
Yes, it is. Yes.

714
00:37:50.535 --> 00:37:51.661
Okay.

715
00:37:54.331 --> 00:37:57.959
Hiya. That's a lot of money
to be counting out in public.

716
00:37:58.043 --> 00:37:59.169
Yeah.

717
00:37:59.419 --> 00:38:02.589
Why don't I take him to
the office and verify it?

718
00:38:03.006 --> 00:38:04.216
A little privacy.

719
00:38:04.299 --> 00:38:07.594
And by the way,
send over a nice bottle of champagne.

720
00:38:07.677 --> 00:38:09.221
- Sure will.
- Real special.

721
00:38:09.304 --> 00:38:10.847
I'm Billy Sherbert, casino manager.

722
00:38:10.972 --> 00:38:12.516
Hi.

723
00:38:12.599 --> 00:38:14.267
- Having a good time?
- Yes.

724
00:38:14.351 --> 00:38:16.937
You'll want to count the money in privacy...

725
00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:18.271
I have a plane to catch to Cleveland.

726
00:38:18.396 --> 00:38:19.689
Can I get my winnings?

727
00:38:22.192 --> 00:38:24.736
Look what they did to my hand, man.

728
00:38:27.948 --> 00:38:29.407
I'm gonna give you a choice.

729
00:38:29.491 --> 00:38:32.285
You can have the money and the
hammer, or you can walk out of here.

730
00:38:32.369 --> 00:38:33.495
You can't have both.

731
00:38:33.578 --> 00:38:35.455
- What do you want?
- I want out of here.

732
00:38:35.539 --> 00:38:38.542
And tell your friends what
happens if they fuck around here.

733
00:38:39.376 --> 00:38:40.836
I'm sorry, I made a bad mistake.

734
00:38:40.961 --> 00:38:42.420
Fucking right, you did.

735
00:38:42.504 --> 00:38:44.464
If we catch either one of you again,

736
00:38:44.548 --> 00:38:47.050
we'll break your heads and
you won't walk out of here.

737
00:38:47.133 --> 00:38:50.971
You don't fuck around in this
place, you got it?

738
00:38:51.054 --> 00:38:52.055
Get out of here.

739
00:38:52.222 --> 00:38:53.223
Thank you.

740
00:38:54.266 --> 00:38:56.977
Throw him in the alley and tell
the cops he got hit by a car.

741
00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:59.354
<i>In no time, everything was set in place.</i>

742
00:38:59.437 --> 00:39:02.649
<i>We got rid of the freelance
scamsters, the pro was way up,</i>

743
00:39:02.732 --> 00:39:05.986
<i>the gods were happy,
as happy as they can ever be,</i>

744
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:08.488
<i>and I decided to complicate my life.</i>

745
00:39:08.572 --> 00:39:10.156
<i>For a guy who likes sure things,</i>

746
00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.076
<i>I was about to bet the rest
of my life on a long shot.</i>

747
00:39:13.159 --> 00:39:14.911
We're not getting any younger.

748
00:39:15.036 --> 00:39:16.788
Don't you think it's time?

749
00:39:16.997 --> 00:39:18.623
Aren't you getting tired of all this shit?

750
00:39:18.748 --> 00:39:20.417
Hustling around?

751
00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.335
Are you trying to handicap me?

752
00:39:22.419 --> 00:39:24.588
I'm gonna do you one better.

753
00:39:24.921 --> 00:39:26.882
I'm trying to marry you.

754
00:39:27.757 --> 00:39:29.467
You wanna marry me?

755
00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.095
I'm serious.

756
00:39:34.264 --> 00:39:36.808
I wanna settle down, I want a family.

757
00:39:36.892 --> 00:39:39.644
You got the wrong girl, Sam.

758
00:39:40.103 --> 00:39:42.188
I'd be a good father,
you'd be a good mother.

759
00:39:42.272 --> 00:39:44.858
You don't know me.
You've known me two, three months.

760
00:39:44.941 --> 00:39:46.401
What do you know?

761
00:39:46.484 --> 00:39:48.945
I'm 43 years old. I don't want to wait.

762
00:39:49.404 --> 00:39:50.780
I know you well enough to know

763
00:39:50.864 --> 00:39:52.782
that I really love you very much.

764
00:39:53.491 --> 00:39:56.244
And I can't think of anybody
better to be with

765
00:39:56.328 --> 00:39:58.997
and I don't feel like waiting anymore.

766
00:40:00.999 --> 00:40:04.920
YOU Know & lot of happily married people, Sam?
"Cause, I don't.

767
00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.297
Yeah, I know all that.

768
00:40:11.551 --> 00:40:13.136
I care about you,

769
00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:16.973
but I just don't have those
kind of feelings for you.

770
00:40:19.392 --> 00:40:21.853
I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.

771
00:40:25.482 --> 00:40:26.900
Understand?

772
00:40:28.652 --> 00:40:29.986
I'm sorry.

773
00:40:30.904 --> 00:40:32.155
Mm,

774
00:40:35.158 --> 00:40:37.786
I mean, that can grow,

775
00:40:37.869 --> 00:40:41.790
as long as there's a mutual respect,
that kind of thing can grow.

776
00:40:41.873 --> 00:40:44.918
I'm realistic. I can accept that.

777
00:40:45.794 --> 00:40:47.754
What is love anyway?

778
00:40:47.837 --> 00:40:50.173
It's a mutual respect, it's a devotion,

779
00:40:50.256 --> 00:40:53.176
It's & caring from one person to another.

780
00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:57.472
And if we could set up
some kind of foundation

781
00:40:58.181 --> 00:41:00.183
based on that mutual respect,

782
00:41:01.184 --> 00:41:03.353
I feel eventually you
would care enough about me

783
00:41:03.478 --> 00:41:05.647
that I could live with that.

784
00:41:08.608 --> 00:41:12.696
If it doesn't work out, doesn't play
out, then what happens to me?

785
00:41:13.363 --> 00:41:16.408
You know, I'm doing well now,
and I'm gonna do even better,

786
00:41:16.491 --> 00:41:18.410
so whatever happens,

787
00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:20.662
if it doesn't work out between us,

788
00:41:20.745 --> 00:41:23.456
I'll make sure you're okay
for the rest of your life.

789
00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:25.917
And if there are kids, especially,

790
00:41:26.167 --> 00:41:28.044
I'll take care of you better than...

791
00:41:28.128 --> 00:41:29.546
What are you pitching me?

792
00:41:29.671 --> 00:41:31.047
Just what I said.

793
00:41:32.048 --> 00:41:36.344
You'll be set up for the rest of your
life, that I can promise you.

794
00:41:41.057 --> 00:41:42.809
Wanna take a chance?

795
00:41:52.485 --> 00:41:55.321
<i>When I married Ginger,
I knew all the stories.</i>

796
00:41:55.405 --> 00:41:59.909
<i>But I didn't give a fuck.
"I'm Sam Rothstein," I said, "I can change her."</i>

797
00:42:02.078 --> 00:42:03.621
<i>It was typical Ace.</i>

798
00:42:03.705 --> 00:42:06.958
<i>He invited the biggest people
in town and he knew they'd show</i>

799
00:42:07.042 --> 00:42:09.335
<i>'cause they all wanted something from him.</i>

800
00:42:09.419 --> 00:42:12.839
<i>With Ace, nobody ever got a free
ride, even Ginger.</i>

801
00:42:12.922 --> 00:42:14.716
<i>With her, he still covered his bets.</i>

802
00:42:14.799 --> 00:42:17.927
<i>They had to have the baby
before they could get married.</i>

803
00:42:18.094 --> 00:42:20.680
<i>He even made Jenny and me
watch Amy for a few days</i>

804
00:42:20.764 --> 00:42:22.307
<i>when they went on their honeymoon,</i>

805
00:42:22.432 --> 00:42:24.059
<i>but I didn't mind, we loved the kid.</i>

806
00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:30.899
<i>Can you feel my eyes on you?</i>

807
00:42:31.566 --> 00:42:33.943
<i>Can you feel me look into your heart?</i>

808
00:42:34.944 --> 00:42:37.655
<i>Can you feel me in the pit of your stomach?</i>

809
00:42:40.575 --> 00:42:42.452
<i>Can you feel me in you?</i>

810
00:42:44.204 --> 00:42:45.747
<i>In your heart?</i>

811
00:42:48.249 --> 00:42:50.251
<i>Don't make me come there.</i>

812
00:42:50.919 --> 00:42:52.253
<i>Answer me.</i>

813
00:42:52.962 --> 00:42:54.130
<i>I love you.</i>

814
00:42:54.339 --> 00:42:56.216
But, baby, do you know that I love you, too?

815
00:42:56.299 --> 00:42:57.675
<i>I know, Lester.</i>

816
00:42:57.759 --> 00:42:59.761
- Do you know <i>that?</i>
- Yeah.

817
00:43:00.595 --> 00:43:03.389
<i>This is the best thing I can
do for my life right now.</i>

818
00:43:03.473 --> 00:43:06.059
That's right. So it's going to be okay.

819
00:43:06.392 --> 00:43:07.602
Promise?

820
00:43:07.685 --> 00:43:10.980
God. I wish you all the luck in the world.

821
00:43:11.481 --> 00:43:12.607
<i>You do?</i>

822
00:43:12.732 --> 00:43:13.858
Yeah, I do.

823
00:43:14.275 --> 00:43:17.028
It's the best thing you can do right now.

824
00:43:17.612 --> 00:43:20.907
I mean this. You'll have real security.

825
00:43:21.324 --> 00:43:25.578
Sweetheart, you're gonna be
situated just right in Vegas.

826
00:43:25.662 --> 00:43:27.539
<i>Come on, this is great for us.</i>

827
00:43:27.872 --> 00:43:29.499
<i>I'm always gonna be here for you.</i>

828
00:43:29.666 --> 00:43:31.292
<i>I ain't going no place.</i>

829
00:43:32.877 --> 00:43:35.046
<i>I'm looking at you right now.</i>

830
00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:39.217
<i>I'm seeing you for the very first
time, right this minute.</i>

831
00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:42.095
<i>I'm seeing you. I can feel my heart click.</i>

832
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:46.516
<i>I see you 14 years old,
I see you the first second I ever saw you.</i>

833
00:43:47.642 --> 00:43:51.688
<i>I see you long-legged little
colt, stupid braces on your teeth.</i>

834
00:43:52.272 --> 00:43:53.898
Okay, then.

835
00:43:54.023 --> 00:43:55.692
<i>Every time I see you, that's what I see.</i>

836
00:43:56.234 --> 00:43:57.902
Talk to you later.

837
00:43:58.194 --> 00:43:59.237
Bye.

838
00:44:05.702 --> 00:44:06.703
You all right?

839
00:44:06.786 --> 00:44:07.787
Yeah.

840
00:44:09.622 --> 00:44:11.332
Why are you crying?

841
00:44:13.501 --> 00:44:14.627
I'm not crying.

842
00:44:20.258 --> 00:44:22.635
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.

843
00:44:22.719 --> 00:44:24.470
I'm okay, I just...

844
00:44:28.308 --> 00:44:30.435
You just have to understand.

845
00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:33.563
I've been with Lester since I was a kid.

846
00:44:35.982 --> 00:44:38.026
I just wanted to say goodbye.

847
00:44:39.152 --> 00:44:41.196
I just... I don't...

848
00:44:42.947 --> 00:44:45.408
I think I have a right to do that.

849
00:44:48.453 --> 00:44:49.621
Okay?

850
00:44:49.746 --> 00:44:50.914
It's all right.

851
00:44:52.582 --> 00:44:55.084
But that part of your life is over with.

852
00:44:55.168 --> 00:44:57.170
Yeah. Right?

853
00:44:58.087 --> 00:44:59.839
You're with me now.

854
00:45:00.757 --> 00:45:02.342
Yeah. Right?

855
00:45:02.425 --> 00:45:03.426
Uh-huh.

856
00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:06.888
You're sure?

857
00:45:07.013 --> 00:45:08.181
Yeah.

858
00:45:11.935 --> 00:45:13.102
Yeah.

859
00:45:15.313 --> 00:45:16.856
You wanna go? Let's go back in.

860
00:45:16.981 --> 00:45:18.524
Okay.

861
00:45:34.707 --> 00:45:38.836
<i>What a difference a day made</i>

862
00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:40.296
It's great.

863
00:45:43.216 --> 00:45:45.260
<i>Twenty-four little hours</i>

864
00:45:45.343 --> 00:45:46.594
It's great.

865
00:45:50.223 --> 00:45:53.810
It's all my stuff. Oh, my God.

866
00:45:54.602 --> 00:45:56.562
You brought all my stuff!

867
00:45:56.646 --> 00:45:57.981
I can't...

868
00:45:59.524 --> 00:46:01.359
Try it on, it's yours.

869
00:46:01.985 --> 00:46:03.528
You're kidding.

870
00:46:05.196 --> 00:46:06.572
Oh, my God.

871
00:46:07.573 --> 00:46:08.616
What is it?

872
00:46:08.741 --> 00:46:09.784
It's chinchilla.

873
00:46:10.702 --> 00:46:12.328
Oh, it's so soft.

874
00:46:13.454 --> 00:46:14.455
It's nice, isn't it?

875
00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:15.623
Oh.

876
00:46:19.836 --> 00:46:22.171
No one's ever been so nice to me.

877
00:46:33.725 --> 00:46:35.393
Oh, my God!

878
00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:40.773
Do you think it's too much if I
wear these all on the same day?

879
00:46:40.857 --> 00:46:42.859
You do whatever you want.

880
00:46:43.026 --> 00:46:45.653
Do I keep my promises
or do I keep my promises?

881
00:46:45.737 --> 00:46:46.988
It's so wonderful.

882
00:46:47.113 --> 00:46:48.364
The jewelry's not so bad either.

883
00:46:48.448 --> 00:46:49.824
The only thing is,

884
00:46:49.907 --> 00:46:52.493
we shouldn't keep this in the
house, we gotta put it in the bank.

885
00:46:52.577 --> 00:46:55.413
Come on, can I keep this one in the house?

886
00:46:55.538 --> 00:46:57.248
Pay attention to me.

887
00:46:58.541 --> 00:46:59.959
What I'm gonna tell you is very important.

888
00:47:00.084 --> 00:47:01.544
Okay.

889
00:47:01.627 --> 00:47:03.629
All this stuff doesn't mean anything.

890
00:47:03.713 --> 00:47:06.424
Money, this,
doesn't mean anything without trust.

891
00:47:06.507 --> 00:47:08.885
I have to be able to trust you with my life.

892
00:47:09.218 --> 00:47:12.263
<i>It's heaven when you</i>

893
00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:19.479
<i>Find romance on your menu</i>

894
00:47:19.562 --> 00:47:21.856
<i>With over $1 million in cash and jewels</i>

895
00:47:21.981 --> 00:47:24.317
<i>tucked in a bank in Vegas, only for Ginger,</i>

896
00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:27.403
<i>she was secure and happy,
she loved that shit.</i>

897
00:47:27.487 --> 00:47:31.657
<i>But a guy in my line of work has to
have a lot of payoff cash around.</i>

898
00:47:31.741 --> 00:47:34.452
<i>Crooked cops and kidnappers
don't take checks.</i>

899
00:47:34.869 --> 00:47:36.829
Need a little help with that, Mr. Collins?

900
00:47:36.913 --> 00:47:39.832
<i>Sol put $2 million in
cash in a Los Angeles bank</i>

901
00:47:39.916 --> 00:47:42.835
<i>under the name of Mr. and Mrs. Tom Collins.</i>

902
00:47:42.919 --> 00:47:46.214
<i>This was strictly my shakedown
and kidnapping money.</i>

903
00:47:50.426 --> 00:47:53.179
<i>And since I'd either be in
jail or locked in a closet</i>

904
00:47:53.262 --> 00:47:54.680
<i>when I needed the money the most,</i>

905
00:47:54.764 --> 00:47:58.726
<i>I gave Ginger the only key to the
cash that could get me back alive.</i>

906
00:48:00.311 --> 00:48:01.521
<i>I'll take you there</i>

907
00:48:01.646 --> 00:48:02.855
<i>I'm callin', callin'</i>

908
00:48:02.939 --> 00:48:04.941
<i>Callin' for mercy</i>

909
00:48:05.024 --> 00:48:06.901
<i>I'll take you there</i>

910
00:48:06.984 --> 00:48:09.654
<i>Mercy, mercy</i>

911
00:48:09.737 --> 00:48:11.739
<i>I'll take you there</i>

912
00:48:12.115 --> 00:48:14.075
This is a signature card.

913
00:48:15.743 --> 00:48:17.703
Once she signs those papers,

914
00:48:17.829 --> 00:48:19.831
she'll be the only person
with access to the box,

915
00:48:19.914 --> 00:48:21.707
no one else, including myself?

916
00:48:21.791 --> 00:48:24.627
That's right, that's the way you wanted it.

917
00:48:25.044 --> 00:48:27.296
Sam, let me ask you a question.

918
00:48:27.839 --> 00:48:29.549
You must really trust your wife.

919
00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:34.178
Yeah, sure I do. Why?

920
00:48:34.262 --> 00:48:37.640
No, it's good. It's just unusual.

921
00:48:38.057 --> 00:48:39.976
To tell you the truth,
so many of my clients don't.

922
00:48:45.815 --> 00:48:46.899
Okay.

923
00:48:50.653 --> 00:48:56.117
<i>Never will I know happiness</i>

924
00:48:56.242 --> 00:48:58.995
<i>With Ginger and the money in
place, I felt covered.</i>

925
00:48:59.078 --> 00:49:01.581
<i>And to play it safe,
I switched job titles again</i>

926
00:49:01.664 --> 00:49:04.834
<i>and made myself Food and Beverage Director.</i>

927
00:49:05.084 --> 00:49:07.587
<i>This way, nobody would
bother me about a license.</i>

928
00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:09.672
<i>I mean, Vegas was like a dream for me.</i>

929
00:49:09.755 --> 00:49:12.675
<i>Trouble was, Nicky was
dreaming his own kind of Vegas.</i>

930
00:49:12.758 --> 00:49:14.635
<i>I put money out on the street,</i>

931
00:49:14.719 --> 00:49:17.555
<i>charging three points a week,
juice to the dealers.</i>

932
00:49:17.638 --> 00:49:19.098
Don't make us come looking for you.

933
00:49:19.182 --> 00:49:21.517
You won't have to. Thanks, Nicky.

934
00:49:23.019 --> 00:49:25.605
<i>They were degenerate gamblers, coke freaks.</i>

935
00:49:25.688 --> 00:49:29.442
<i>In no time, I had half the dealers
in the Tangiers in my pocket.</i>

936
00:49:29.525 --> 00:49:33.863
<i>The next thing I did, I started
busting out high-stakes poker players.</i>

937
00:49:34.071 --> 00:49:38.784
<i>It was so obvious. AH of Nicky's
half-assed mechanics were signal-happy.</i>

938
00:49:38.868 --> 00:49:40.786
I'm gonna open for $500.

939
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:42.663
<i>Signaling back and forth.</i>

940
00:49:43.956 --> 00:49:46.209
Why you crying with
two loaves of bread under your arm?

941
00:49:46.292 --> 00:49:47.710
<i>Nicky thought nobody was watching him.</i>

942
00:49:47.877 --> 00:49:49.337
<i>He was wrong.</i>

943
00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:52.089
<i>And I didn't want any of
those agents near my place.</i>

944
00:49:52.173 --> 00:49:53.966
Four aces.

945
00:49:54.091 --> 00:49:55.885
I can't believe this.

946
00:49:55.968 --> 00:49:59.263
If I didn't have bad
luck, I wouldn't have any luck.

947
00:50:00.848 --> 00:50:03.643
<i>I wished Nicky and
his crew would just get lost.</i>

948
00:50:03.726 --> 00:50:04.894
<i>What am I gonna do?</i>

949
00:50:05.019 --> 00:50:06.145
<i>Go back home and start a war?</i>

950
00:50:06.229 --> 00:50:07.396
<i>Nicky's a made guy and I'm not.</i>

951
00:50:07.522 --> 00:50:08.648
<i>I can't do that.</i>

952
00:50:08.731 --> 00:50:11.067
Careful. Gaming agents
are all over the place.

953
00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:13.528
So I'm not allowed
to get lucky in this place?

954
00:50:13.611 --> 00:50:15.279
You've been lucky all week.

955
00:50:15.404 --> 00:50:17.073
They're looking to nail you.

956
00:50:18.449 --> 00:50:20.868
<i>Ace was so fucking worried about his casino,</i>

957
00:50:20.993 --> 00:50:23.412
<i>he forgot what we were doing here.</i>

958
00:50:23.829 --> 00:50:25.915
<i>A million times I wanted to yell</i>

959
00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:28.125
<i>in his fucking ear, "This is Las Vegas.</i>

960
00:50:28.209 --> 00:50:32.046
<i>"We're supposed to be out here
robbing, you dumb fucking hebe."</i>

961
00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:38.970
I don't give a shit who he's connected to,

962
00:50:39.095 --> 00:50:40.846
tell him to take his feet off the table.

963
00:50:40.930 --> 00:50:43.182
What does he think this is,
a goddamn sawdust joint?

964
00:50:44.517 --> 00:50:48.437
Sir, would you mind taking
your feet off the table?

965
00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:51.899
Yeah, I would mind. I'm having a bad night.

966
00:50:53.568 --> 00:50:55.570
Fucking asshole won't budge.

967
00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:57.822
Call security.

968
00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.785
How are you?

969
00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:04.453
Good. How are you?

970
00:51:04.537 --> 00:51:05.746
Wanna do me a favor?

971
00:51:05.830 --> 00:51:07.582
Take your feet off the
table and put your shoes on.

972
00:51:08.207 --> 00:51:09.458
Fuck you.

973
00:51:12.962 --> 00:51:14.755
I want you to exit this guy off the premises

974
00:51:14.839 --> 00:51:18.509
and use his head to open the fucking door.

975
00:51:18.593 --> 00:51:20.469
Sir, you're gonna have to leave.

976
00:51:20.636 --> 00:51:22.513
You mind accompanying us outside?

977
00:51:22.972 --> 00:51:24.432
Bullshit. I ain't going anywhere with you.

978
00:51:24.515 --> 00:51:25.516
Bullshit, you're out of here.

979
00:51:25.641 --> 00:51:26.642
Fuck you!

980
00:51:26.726 --> 00:51:28.394
You know who you're fucking with, huh?

981
00:51:28.519 --> 00:51:30.229
Do you?

982
00:51:30.313 --> 00:51:31.939
You fucking faggot.

983
00:51:32.064 --> 00:51:33.691
Do you know who you're fucking with?

984
00:51:33.816 --> 00:51:35.109
Leave me alone!

985
00:51:35.234 --> 00:51:36.527
Here we go.

986
00:51:36.611 --> 00:51:38.904
You gotta be kidding me!

987
00:51:39.071 --> 00:51:41.449
<i>And an hour later, I get the call.</i>

988
00:51:41.532 --> 00:51:43.492
Ace, what happened?

989
00:51:43.618 --> 00:51:45.578
Did you know that guy was with me?

990
00:51:45.661 --> 00:51:47.830
No, I didn't. But you know what he did?

991
00:51:48.414 --> 00:51:51.208
I walked over to him politely and
he tells me to go fuck myself.

992
00:51:51.292 --> 00:51:52.293
Then he called me a faggot.

993
00:51:52.418 --> 00:51:53.419
What?

994
00:51:53.502 --> 00:51:54.670
<i>I threw the cocksucker out.</i>

995
00:51:54.837 --> 00:51:56.047
Come here.

996
00:51:56.172 --> 00:51:58.090
You called my friend a faggot?

997
00:51:58.215 --> 00:52:00.176
You tell him to fuck himself?
Is that what you did?

998
00:52:00.968 --> 00:52:03.888
You fucking hick. You fucking hick, you.

999
00:52:03.971 --> 00:52:05.014
<i>Come here.</i>

1000
00:52:05.681 --> 00:52:07.141
Come here.

1001
00:52:07.224 --> 00:52:08.976
You go over there and you apologize.

1002
00:52:09.101 --> 00:52:10.853
You better hope he lets you back in.

1003
00:52:10.936 --> 00:52:14.273
<i>If you get out of line
again, I'll smash your head so hard</i>

1004
00:52:14.357 --> 00:52:16.359
you won't be able to get that cowboy hat on,

1005
00:52:16.484 --> 00:52:18.444
you hear me? You fucking hick.

1006
00:52:18.527 --> 00:52:22.490
Sammy, listen, this guy obviously
doesn't know who he was talking to.

1007
00:52:22.573 --> 00:52:25.201
He doesn't know that we're dear friends.

1008
00:52:25.368 --> 00:52:27.119
I mean, he's already very sorry.

1009
00:52:27.203 --> 00:52:30.247
But if you could do me a
favor and let him back in,

1010
00:52:30.331 --> 00:52:32.750
I swear he'll never get out of line again.

1011
00:52:32.833 --> 00:52:34.960
If he does it again, he's out for good.

1012
00:52:35.086 --> 00:52:37.254
I'll never let him in the place again.

1013
00:52:37.546 --> 00:52:38.547
<i>I'm sorry about this, really.</i>

1014
00:52:38.839 --> 00:52:40.591
All right, Ace?

1015
00:52:41.384 --> 00:52:42.760
Pan,

1016
00:52:43.386 --> 00:52:45.054
You took your boots off?

1017
00:52:45.221 --> 00:52:46.889
You put your feet on the table?

1018
00:52:46.972 --> 00:52:51.310
You shit-kicking, stinky,
horse-manure-smelling motherfucker, you!

1019
00:52:51.394 --> 00:52:55.523
You fuck me up over there,
I'll stick you in the desert. Go apologize.

1020
00:52:55.606 --> 00:52:57.108
- Get the fuck...
- I'm sorry.

1021
00:53:01.195 --> 00:53:03.614
<i>You know, Ace could be a very touchy guy.</i>

1022
00:53:03.698 --> 00:53:05.950
<i>Especially when he got bigger in town.</i>

1023
00:53:06.033 --> 00:53:09.286
<i>Like when he hired that Jonathan
and David away from the Palace</i>

1024
00:53:09.370 --> 00:53:12.998
<i>by building them a new stage and
giving them a silver Rolls-Royce.</i>

1025
00:53:13.082 --> 00:53:15.292
<i>But he knew how to bring in the crowds.</i>

1026
00:53:15.418 --> 00:53:17.670
<i>Knew all the fucking angles.</i>

1027
00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:20.673
<i>He brought over the whole</i> 
Femme Fatale <i>show from Paris.</i>

1028
00:53:20.756 --> 00:53:23.759
<i>But he forgot how lazy
them European broads can get.</i>

1029
00:53:24.009 --> 00:53:25.594
<i>He weighed them once a week</i>

1030
00:53:25.678 --> 00:53:27.763
<i>to make sure they didn't
blow up like balloons.</i>

1031
00:53:28.305 --> 00:53:29.724
You're eight pounds over.

1032
00:53:29.849 --> 00:53:31.267
What's the reason for this?

1033
00:53:31.350 --> 00:53:33.269
Mr. Rothstein, sir...

1034
00:53:33.394 --> 00:53:35.312
Never mind the "sir."

1035
00:53:35.396 --> 00:53:36.772
Why is she eight pounds over?

1036
00:53:36.897 --> 00:53:38.232
I'm trying to offer you the respect...

1037
00:53:38.315 --> 00:53:40.526
Mr. Rothstein is good enough for you.

1038
00:53:40.609 --> 00:53:44.280
Sometimes when you put that
pressure point on them...

1039
00:53:44.363 --> 00:53:46.073
All you do is give me answers.

1040
00:53:46.198 --> 00:53:47.867
Just give me the right answer.

1041
00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:51.871
I guess she's frightened if she
doesn't lose weight, she may get fired.

1042
00:53:51.954 --> 00:53:53.330
That's right, she will get fired.

1043
00:53:53.456 --> 00:53:54.832
Send her back to Paris.

1044
00:53:54.915 --> 00:53:56.500
Just stop everything.

1045
00:53:56.625 --> 00:53:58.294
This woman's an institution...

1046
00:53:59.128 --> 00:54:00.296
She's lazy.

1047
00:54:00.379 --> 00:54:02.298
<i>I gotta give the guy credit.</i>

1048
00:54:02.381 --> 00:54:04.550
<i>I mean, he does the most obvious thing.</i>

1049
00:54:04.633 --> 00:54:06.177
<i>This is the only town in the country</i>

1050
00:54:06.302 --> 00:54:07.887
<i>where a bookie joint is legit.</i>

1051
00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:10.055
<i>So why not take advantage, right?</i>

1052
00:54:10.139 --> 00:54:12.433
<i>So he took bookie joints off the street</i>

1053
00:54:12.558 --> 00:54:14.852
<i>and opened them up inside the casino.</i>

1054
00:54:14.935 --> 00:54:17.396
<i>Within a few years, he had every casino</i>

1055
00:54:17.521 --> 00:54:19.982
<i>on The Strip trying to copy off of him.</i>

1056
00:54:20.483 --> 00:54:22.485
<i>Between my innovations</i>

1057
00:54:25.488 --> 00:54:28.073
<i>and Nicky's dedication to his job,</i>

1058
00:54:30.576 --> 00:54:33.412
<i>I soon had the best operation on The Strip.</i>

1059
00:54:36.999 --> 00:54:39.835
Be careful,
there's a lot of heat on you already.

1060
00:54:40.669 --> 00:54:42.004
Why? Somebody's complaining?

1061
00:54:42.087 --> 00:54:44.548
I'm hearing things from security.

1062
00:54:44.632 --> 00:54:47.593
The sheriff's looking to
put you in the Black Book.

1063
00:54:47.676 --> 00:54:49.720
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit.

1064
00:54:49.804 --> 00:54:51.639
They got two names for the whole country

1065
00:54:51.764 --> 00:54:53.599
and one of them is still Al Capone.

1066
00:54:53.682 --> 00:54:56.435
If they put you in that book,
you're gonna be in trouble.

1067
00:54:56.519 --> 00:54:58.896
You will not be able to walk into a casino.

1068
00:54:59.688 --> 00:55:02.233
I'm trying to make a living, that's all.

1069
00:55:02.316 --> 00:55:04.610
I'm just telling you,
don't say I didn't warn you.

1070
00:55:04.693 --> 00:55:06.070
All right.

1071
00:55:11.408 --> 00:55:13.035
Mrs. Rothstein, straight ahead.

1072
00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:14.787
Very nice. Thank you.

1073
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:15.871
Smile...

1074
00:55:16.038 --> 00:55:17.081
Just look...

1075
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:22.127
<i>For his hard work and dedication</i>

1076
00:55:22.211 --> 00:55:25.005
<i>and the new life-blood
he has instilled in Las Vegas,</i>

1077
00:55:25.089 --> 00:55:26.674
<i>Sam has established himself</i>

1078
00:55:26.757 --> 00:55:30.052
<i>as an indispensable member
of the gaming community.</i>

1079
00:55:30.553 --> 00:55:33.055
<i>As the head of the Tangiers
Gaming Corporation,</i>

1080
00:55:33.138 --> 00:55:35.349
<i>it's my pleasure to welcome Sam Rothstein</i>

1081
00:55:35.474 --> 00:55:37.685
<i>to the Vegas Valley Country Club.</i>

1082
00:55:44.859 --> 00:55:47.528
<i>Back home, they'd have put
me in jail for what I'm doing</i>

1083
00:55:47.611 --> 00:55:49.822
<i>but out here, they're giving me awards.</i>

1084
00:55:49.905 --> 00:55:54.243
<i>It is with great pleasure that I
accept this certificate of appreciation</i>

1085
00:55:54.326 --> 00:55:57.496
<i>from the Charitable Foundations
of Greater Las Vegas.</i>

1086
00:55:58.122 --> 00:55:59.665
Congratulations, sweetheart.

1087
00:55:59.748 --> 00:56:02.751
Sam raised more than
we've ever raised before.

1088
00:56:03.919 --> 00:56:05.921
<i>But my greatest pleasure was watching</i>

1089
00:56:06.088 --> 00:56:08.132
<i>my wife, Ginger, work the room.</i>

1090
00:56:08.757 --> 00:56:10.134
<i>They all loved her.</i>

1091
00:56:10.259 --> 00:56:11.635
<i>How could you not love her?</i>

1092
00:56:11.719 --> 00:56:14.054
<i>She could be the most
charming woman you ever saw.</i>

1093
00:56:14.138 --> 00:56:15.806
<i>People loved to be around her.</i>

1094
00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:19.101
You've got to bring Amy
to Sasha's birthday party.

1095
00:56:19.935 --> 00:56:21.437
See you 3:00, Saturday.

1096
00:56:21.562 --> 00:56:23.105
Yes, all right.

1097
00:56:23.856 --> 00:56:25.983
<i>She made everybody feel good.</i>

1098
00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:33.532
Congratulations, Sam.

1099
00:56:33.616 --> 00:56:34.825
Thanks.

1100
00:56:35.451 --> 00:56:36.869
Hello, Mrs. Rothstein. How are you?

1101
00:56:36.994 --> 00:56:38.454
Hi. Oh.

1102
00:56:40.164 --> 00:56:41.832
You're the most gorgeous woman
I've ever seen.

1103
00:56:41.916 --> 00:56:44.043
You're a lucky man, Mr. Rothstein.

1104
00:56:47.546 --> 00:56:49.632
Thank you. Thanks for that compliment.

1105
00:56:50.633 --> 00:56:52.343
<i>He was a young kid from the casino.</i>

1106
00:56:52.468 --> 00:56:54.219
<i>Nice kid. Bright boy.</i>

1107
00:56:54.553 --> 00:56:56.055
<i>What balls on this fucking kid.</i>

1108
00:56:56.138 --> 00:56:57.640
<i>The next day I fired him.</i>

1109
00:56:59.058 --> 00:57:00.809
<i>Ginger had that effect on people.</i>

1110
00:57:00.976 --> 00:57:02.728
<i>I think she even encouraged them.</i>

1111
00:57:02.811 --> 00:57:04.855
Do you wanna see this one?

1112
00:57:06.815 --> 00:57:10.569
Daddy gave me all this jewelry
because he loves me so much.

1113
00:57:10.861 --> 00:57:12.279
<i>But as much as they loved her...</i>

1114
00:57:12.363 --> 00:57:13.781
Fabulous!

1115
00:57:13.864 --> 00:57:15.658
<i>...they didn't know what really moved her.</i>

1116
00:57:15.741 --> 00:57:19.578
Look at this. Daddy gave me this...

1117
00:57:19.662 --> 00:57:21.830
<i>And with Ginger happy, I was able</i>

1118
00:57:21.997 --> 00:57:24.166
<i>to concentrate on what I knew best.</i>

1119
00:57:24.333 --> 00:57:26.835
Loose machines are right back over there.

1120
00:57:27.169 --> 00:57:29.380
What are they doing back there?

1121
00:57:29.463 --> 00:57:31.382
- Okay.
- You can't even see them there.

1122
00:57:31.465 --> 00:57:33.509
What about the progressives
with the high jackpots?

1123
00:57:33.592 --> 00:57:35.344
Where are they? These machines are hidden.

1124
00:57:35.427 --> 00:57:36.470
These are our best machines.

1125
00:57:36.595 --> 00:57:37.596
They bring all the action.

1126
00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:39.056
No wonder the drop is off.

1127
00:57:39.139 --> 00:57:40.766
The action is in the front, not the back.

1128
00:57:40.849 --> 00:57:42.768
Bring them up front. All right, I will.

1129
00:57:42.851 --> 00:57:46.271
Listen carefully,
there are three ways of doing things here,

1130
00:57:46.355 --> 00:57:49.358
the right way, the wrong way
and the way that I do it.

1131
00:57:49.817 --> 00:57:51.193
You understand?

1132
00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:52.736
I do, I'll get right on it.

1133
00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:54.154
And thank you.

1134
00:57:54.279 --> 00:57:55.614
Don't thank me, just do it.

1135
00:57:55.698 --> 00:57:58.033
You're the slots manager.
I shouldn't have to tell you this.

1136
00:57:59.410 --> 00:58:00.869
Dang, you are right, Mr. Rothstein.

1137
00:58:01.036 --> 00:58:02.496
I am so sorry.

1138
00:58:04.123 --> 00:58:06.625
<i>So I ended up working, what, 18-hour days.</i>

1139
00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:09.461
<i>Ginger was the one who wound
up enjoying the best of Vegas.</i>

1140
00:58:09.545 --> 00:58:12.965
Come with me, please.
I have a better table for you. Sorry.

1141
00:58:13.048 --> 00:58:15.259
What did you say to that fucking jerk?

1142
00:58:15.342 --> 00:58:17.845
Mm him

1143
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:22.182
Well, you might as well
get something out of it.

1144
00:58:24.810 --> 00:58:28.647
<i>Well, it wasn't long before what I
was afraid was gonna happen, happened.</i>

1145
00:58:28.731 --> 00:58:30.107
<i>Nicky managed to get himself banned</i>

1146
00:58:30.232 --> 00:58:32.443
<i>from every casino in Las Vegas.</i>

1147
00:58:32.526 --> 00:58:34.278
<i>From then on, I couldn't be seen talking</i>

1148
00:58:34.361 --> 00:58:36.655
<i>to him anywhere in or near Vegas.</i>

1149
00:58:36.739 --> 00:58:38.574
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

1150
00:58:38.657 --> 00:58:43.912
"...detrimental to gaming and he will
be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas.

1151
00:58:44.246 --> 00:58:48.500
"And the casinos can be fined
as much as $100,000

1152
00:58:48.584 --> 00:58:50.377
"every time he shows up."

1153
00:58:50.461 --> 00:58:52.087
You believe this shit?

1154
00:58:52.212 --> 00:58:53.839
Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.

1155
00:58:54.006 --> 00:58:57.384
"Because of notorious
and unsavory reputation."

1156
00:58:57.468 --> 00:58:59.261
Motherfucker!

1157
00:59:01.597 --> 00:59:03.182
Is there any way around this?

1158
00:59:03.307 --> 00:59:04.933
No, there's no way.

1159
00:59:06.018 --> 00:59:08.771
Let's say, for instance,

1160
00:59:09.021 --> 00:59:12.691
I wanna go in a restaurant,
which happens to be in a casino,

1161
00:59:12.775 --> 00:59:14.526
to get one of those sandwiches I like?

1162
00:59:14.610 --> 00:59:17.738
Forget it. You can't even set
foot in the parking lot.

1163
00:59:18.447 --> 00:59:20.240
That's how serious it is.

1164
00:59:23.494 --> 00:59:25.120
In other words, I'm fucked?

1165
00:59:25.245 --> 00:59:26.872
In so many words, yes.

1166
00:59:26.955 --> 00:59:28.582
<i>It just didn't sink into his head</i>

1167
00:59:28.707 --> 00:59:30.334
<i>about the Black Book and what it meant.</i>

1168
00:59:30.417 --> 00:59:33.420
<i>Not being able to go into
a casino is one thing,</i>

1169
00:59:33.504 --> 00:59:35.839
<i>but being in this book etched your name</i>

1170
00:59:35.964 --> 00:59:38.342
<i>into the brains of every cop and FBI agent.</i>

1171
00:59:38.425 --> 00:59:40.094
<i>You're listed in there with Al Capone.</i>

1172
00:59:40.219 --> 00:59:41.887
<i>But Nicky didn't care.</i>

1173
00:59:41.970 --> 00:59:43.764
I gotta do something. I gotta do something.

1174
00:59:43.889 --> 00:59:45.682
They ain't getting rid of me.

1175
00:59:45.766 --> 00:59:47.017
They're not getting rid of me.

1176
00:59:47.142 --> 00:59:48.435
I'm staying here.

1177
00:59:48.519 --> 00:59:51.230
Fuck them. Fuck them.

1178
00:59:55.692 --> 00:59:58.153
<i>So, once they pulled that shit,</i>

1179
00:59:58.237 --> 01:00:01.615
<i>I started doing my own things
nobody ever thought of doing.</i>

1180
01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:04.743
<i>To keep an eye on things,
I brought in my brother, Dominick,</i>

1181
01:00:04.827 --> 01:00:06.745
<i>and some desperados</i>

1182
01:00:06.829 --> 01:00:10.457
<i>and started knocking over high-rollers,
casino bosses, bookmakers.</i>

1183
01:00:10.541 --> 01:00:12.459
<i>Anybody right here in town.</i>

1184
01:00:12.584 --> 01:00:14.503
I had a good fucking crew going for me.

1185
01:00:15.337 --> 01:00:18.882
<i>I had Sal Fusco, a great second-story guy.</i>

1186
01:00:19.341 --> 01:00:23.679
<i>Jack Hardy. He worked for a safe
company before he did a six-year bit.</i>

1187
01:00:24.054 --> 01:00:26.140
<i>And then there was Bernie Blue.</i>

1188
01:00:26.265 --> 01:00:28.350
<i>This guy could bypass any alarm for me.</i>

1189
01:00:29.476 --> 01:00:31.186
<i>It was like old times.</i>

1190
01:00:31.603 --> 01:00:35.524
<i>And I opened up my own jewelry store
too, The Gold Rush.</i>

1191
01:00:35.607 --> 01:00:39.069
<i>Sometimes I used to go along on a
heist, just for the fun of it</i>

1192
01:00:39.403 --> 01:00:41.780
<i>but I didn't like the people I
was ripping off looking at me</i>

1193
01:00:41.864 --> 01:00:44.616
<i>so I used to turn their
fucking pictures around.</i>

1194
01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.702
What's taking so long?

1195
01:00:46.869 --> 01:00:48.370
This is a motherfucker.

1196
01:00:49.204 --> 01:00:52.166
Learn how to open the things
so you don't have to take them.

1197
01:00:52.249 --> 01:00:54.293
Some of these stones
got a lot of niggers in them.

1198
01:00:54.376 --> 01:00:56.670
Tell Pepe if he's switching stones on us

1199
01:00:56.753 --> 01:00:58.672
he better take a camel back to Nigeria.

1200
01:01:00.883 --> 01:01:01.842
Yeah?

1201
01:01:01.967 --> 01:01:03.802
- They're in Penthouse K.
- Checked in alone?

1202
01:01:03.927 --> 01:01:05.846
- Yes.
- Are they out now?

1203
01:01:05.971 --> 01:01:06.972
Yes. Don't worry.

1204
01:01:07.055 --> 01:01:08.140
Thanks.

1205
01:01:08.223 --> 01:01:10.642
<i>He had tipsters all over town. Bellmen.</i>

1206
01:01:10.726 --> 01:01:12.227
This looks good but you got to hurry.

1207
01:01:12.394 --> 01:01:13.896
Yeah, okay.

1208
01:01:13.979 --> 01:01:15.147
<i>Valet Parkers.</i>

1209
01:01:15.272 --> 01:01:16.440
They're checking in.

1210
01:01:16.523 --> 01:01:18.108
- <i>Okay, I'll tell him.</i>
- SAM: Pit bosses.

1211
01:01:18.192 --> 01:01:19.735
Room 1230 at The Sirocco.

1212
01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:21.403
1230.

1213
01:01:21.486 --> 01:01:22.738
<i>Secretaries.</i>

1214
01:01:22.863 --> 01:01:24.072
Mint condition coins.

1215
01:01:24.156 --> 01:01:25.574
Mint condition.

1216
01:01:25.699 --> 01:01:27.117
They all got & piece of the score.

1217
01:01:27.201 --> 01:01:28.410
Car's coming.

1218
01:01:33.332 --> 01:01:35.083
<i>They were very careful.</i>

1219
01:01:35.250 --> 01:01:37.753
<i>They always bypassed the alarms, or else,</i>

1220
01:01:37.836 --> 01:01:39.713
<i>if not, they'd drill enough holes</i>

1221
01:01:39.796 --> 01:01:41.924
<i>to knock through the walls
with a sledgehammer.</i>

1222
01:01:43.884 --> 01:01:46.637
<i>Nicky was grabbing everything he could.</i>

1223
01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:49.598
<i>Nobody out there
was expecting a guy like him.</i>

1224
01:01:51.099 --> 01:01:53.602
<i>To Nicky, Las Vegas was
the fucking Wild West.</i>

1225
01:01:53.685 --> 01:01:55.854
I just got a shipment
of diamonds from Israel.

1226
01:01:55.938 --> 01:01:57.606
<i>What the fuck they expect from me?</i>

1227
01:01:57.731 --> 01:01:59.399
<i>I had to earn, didn't I?</i>

1228
01:02:00.108 --> 01:02:02.277
You know, this diamond has flaws in it.

1229
01:02:02.361 --> 01:02:04.279
There's no flaws.

1230
01:02:04.404 --> 01:02:06.323
I'm doing this for 25 years.

1231
01:02:06.406 --> 01:02:10.160
You better clean your loupe
because there's no flaws.

1232
01:02:10.285 --> 01:02:11.703
<i>Whenever we got local merch,</i>

1233
01:02:11.787 --> 01:02:15.290
<i>we'd usually send it to
Palm Springs or Arizona, I.A.</i>

1234
01:02:15.374 --> 01:02:16.625
<i>I had some sand niggers out there.</i>

1235
01:02:16.792 --> 01:02:18.043
<i>You know, Arabs.</i>

1236
01:02:18.126 --> 01:02:20.712
Are you gonna have a fucking meeting here?

1237
01:02:20.796 --> 01:02:22.923
I know his language.

1238
01:02:23.006 --> 01:02:24.841
$40,000. The whole package.

1239
01:02:24.925 --> 01:02:27.344
$20,000. That's my final offer.

1240
01:02:27.427 --> 01:02:29.304
He suddenly talks English.

1241
01:02:29.429 --> 01:02:31.306
Let's talk turkey here. $25,000.

1242
01:02:32.599 --> 01:02:34.101
<i>I actually turned my bedroom</i>

1243
01:02:34.184 --> 01:02:36.228
<i>into a bank vault
where I kept the choice stuff.</i>

1244
01:02:39.273 --> 01:02:40.899
<i>I couldn't leave it at The Gold Rush</i>

1245
01:02:41.024 --> 01:02:42.693
<i>in case we got raided by the cops</i>

1246
01:02:42.776 --> 01:02:44.861
<i>or if my crew got cute.</i>

1247
01:02:45.153 --> 01:02:46.154
<i>I had the only key.</i>

1248
01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:47.239
<i>Jennifer didn't give a fuck.</i>

1249
01:02:47.322 --> 01:02:50.534
<i>She used to fall asleep on the
couch watching TV every night.</i>

1250
01:02:50.617 --> 01:02:52.369
<i>This stuff was all mine.</i>

1251
01:02:52.494 --> 01:02:54.288
<i>I didn't send any of this back home.</i>

1252
01:02:54.371 --> 01:02:57.541
<i>I couldn't because I wasn't
even supposed to be doing it.</i>

1253
01:02:57.624 --> 01:03:00.335
<i>The bosses were making so
much money with the casinos</i>

1254
01:03:00.419 --> 01:03:03.547
<i>that they didn't want anybody
making any waves for them.</i>

1255
01:03:05.173 --> 01:03:06.842
You gave all the guys a piece of that?

1256
01:03:06.925 --> 01:03:07.843
<i>Hook care of everyone.</i>

1257
01:03:07.968 --> 01:03:08.844
Yeah?

1258
01:03:08.927 --> 01:03:10.887
<i>That's why there
was no organized street stuff</i>

1259
01:03:11.013 --> 01:03:12.514
<i>in Vegas before I came here.</i>

1260
01:03:14.349 --> 01:03:16.768
<i>But how much cash could I bury in my closet?</i>

1261
01:03:16.852 --> 01:03:18.687
...understand, and I'm sure you do,

1262
01:03:18.770 --> 01:03:20.897
in a venture of this kind

1263
01:03:21.023 --> 01:03:23.191
you have to be prepared to
take some kind of loss.

1264
01:03:23.608 --> 01:03:25.569
<i>I put some of the
money into legitimate deals</i>

1265
01:03:25.652 --> 01:03:27.988
<i>with Charlie Clark, Ace's banker.</i>

1266
01:03:28.447 --> 01:03:31.033
- You will try to push it through, Mr. Clark?
- Yes.

1267
01:03:31.116 --> 01:03:33.201
I'm giving you $50,000 cash.

1268
01:03:33.285 --> 01:03:37.122
<i>Then I put some more money into
legitimate places, like my restaurant.</i>

1269
01:03:37.205 --> 01:03:38.790
- Is that the last?
- Yeah.

1270
01:03:38.874 --> 01:03:41.543
<i>I had my kid brother,
Dominick, run it for me.</i>

1271
01:03:43.253 --> 01:03:44.838
Fuckers.

1272
01:03:49.718 --> 01:03:52.554
- Here you go, guys.
- All right. Thanks a lot.

1273
01:03:52.679 --> 01:03:53.805
Enjoy. Have a good time.

1274
01:03:53.889 --> 01:03:55.349
- Hey.
- Choke on it, motherfucker.

1275
01:03:55.474 --> 01:03:56.933
How you doing?

1276
01:03:57.017 --> 01:03:58.935
<i>Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants.</i>

1277
01:03:59.061 --> 01:04:00.979
<i>He was a real restaurant buff.</i>

1278
01:04:01.063 --> 01:04:03.648
<i>And over the years,
he always made money with it.</i>

1279
01:04:03.732 --> 01:04:05.400
<i>In Vegas, he had the Leaning Tower.</i>

1280
01:04:05.525 --> 01:04:07.152
<i>It was a very popular spot.</i>

1281
01:04:07.235 --> 01:04:10.030
<i>He had politicians,
showgirls and movie stars</i>

1282
01:04:10.113 --> 01:04:11.823
<i>hanging out all over the place.</i>

1283
01:04:11.907 --> 01:04:14.368
That show at the Flamingo just gets better.

1284
01:04:14.451 --> 01:04:17.704
Sammy said whenever you have a
minute, give him a call.

1285
01:04:17.788 --> 01:04:19.081
Made a messenger out of you, too?

1286
01:04:19.247 --> 01:04:20.499
Anything for a buck.

1287
01:04:20.582 --> 01:04:22.167
He does it to everybody. Enjoy your dinner.

1288
01:04:22.292 --> 01:04:23.877
Thanks.

1289
01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:27.881
<i>But I gotta tell you,
the thing Nicky liked most was the showgirls.</i>

1290
01:04:27.964 --> 01:04:30.175
<i>To them, Nicky was the movie star.</i>

1291
01:04:30.258 --> 01:04:31.635
You walk past me?

1292
01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:33.136
Hey! This is Shelly.

1293
01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:34.596
Hey, Shelly. How are you?

1294
01:04:34.763 --> 01:04:36.181
And this is Stacy.

1295
01:04:36.264 --> 01:04:38.058
- Stacy.
- This is Nick.

1296
01:04:38.141 --> 01:04:39.643
They wanna have dinner. Come on.

1297
01:04:39.726 --> 01:04:41.228
All right. Let's check the kitchen first.

1298
01:04:41.353 --> 01:04:42.854
Excuse us one second.

1299
01:04:42.938 --> 01:04:46.525
I'll show you. I fly
stuff in fresh every day.

1300
01:04:46.608 --> 01:04:49.569
I get bread from back home,
fish from California.

1301
01:04:49.653 --> 01:04:51.446
You can always
tell a great kitchen like ours

1302
01:04:51.613 --> 01:04:53.365
because of the milk-fed veal.

1303
01:04:53.448 --> 01:04:56.368
That's the secret.
Milk-fed veal is pure white.

1304
01:04:56.451 --> 01:04:58.078
Out here they got that pink veal.

1305
01:04:58.203 --> 01:04:59.788
Slide over, honey.

1306
01:05:00.747 --> 01:05:04.042
Now, pink veal,
you can pound that shit for two days.

1307
01:05:04.126 --> 01:05:05.502
It'll never, ever get tender.

1308
01:05:05.627 --> 01:05:07.045
You know what I mean?

1309
01:05:07.504 --> 01:05:09.047
I left here with the money.

1310
01:05:09.172 --> 01:05:10.715
Got muscled on the street.

1311
01:05:10.799 --> 01:05:14.177
A couple guys, I owe them,
so I gave them the money.

1312
01:05:14.261 --> 01:05:16.012
- That's what I did.
- Yeah?

1313
01:05:16.304 --> 01:05:18.140
You call yourself a man?

1314
01:05:18.306 --> 01:05:20.434
You know you're a lying lowlife,

1315
01:05:20.559 --> 01:05:22.686
motherfucking, gambling, degenerate prick?

1316
01:05:22.769 --> 01:05:25.647
You know that? Two small kids at home.

1317
01:05:26.022 --> 01:05:27.858
I gave you money to pay the fucking rent

1318
01:05:27.983 --> 01:05:29.818
and buy groceries, put the heat on.

1319
01:05:29.901 --> 01:05:33.280
Your wife called Frankie and
told him the fucking heat's off.

1320
01:05:33.488 --> 01:05:35.949
And you didn't gamble that fucking money?

1321
01:05:36.032 --> 01:05:37.659
- No? You didn't?
- I didn't...

1322
01:05:37.742 --> 01:05:39.411
Don't fuck with me, Al.

1323
01:05:39.536 --> 01:05:41.246
Don't make a fuck out of me.

1324
01:05:41.329 --> 01:05:44.624
You wanna embarrass me, make a fool out of me?
You didn't gamble?

1325
01:05:44.708 --> 01:05:46.835
Tell me you gambled the fucking money,

1326
01:05:47.002 --> 01:05:49.129
I'll give you the money to put the heat on.

1327
01:05:49.546 --> 01:05:51.882
Did you gamble? Huh?

1328
01:05:55.427 --> 01:05:57.345
Fucking degenerate.

1329
01:05:57.971 --> 01:05:59.681
Fucking kids at home.

1330
01:06:03.226 --> 01:06:05.437
Here. Get the fuck out of here.

1331
01:06:06.104 --> 01:06:07.856
- Thanks, Nick.
- Yeah.

1332
01:06:07.939 --> 01:06:09.524
Let me find out you fucked up,

1333
01:06:09.649 --> 01:06:11.193
I'll leave you where I find you.

1334
01:06:11.276 --> 01:06:13.361
How many of these you gonna eat?

1335
01:06:13.487 --> 01:06:15.030
- Two.
- Two?

1336
01:06:15.113 --> 01:06:16.823
<i>But around 6:30 in the morning,</i>

1337
01:06:16.907 --> 01:06:20.160
<i>when he finished his day,
no matter where he was,</i>

1338
01:06:20.243 --> 01:06:23.455
<i>he always went home to make
breakfast for his son, Nicky boy.</i>

1339
01:06:23.538 --> 01:06:25.624
I know you like this.

1340
01:06:25.749 --> 01:06:27.834
A little butter, right? Not a lot.

1341
01:06:28.168 --> 01:06:29.794
- You know why, right?
- Yeah.

1342
01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:32.506
- Why - 'Cause it clogs up your heart.

1343
01:06:32.589 --> 01:06:37.219
What a smart kid you are. Okay, eat.

1344
01:06:37.302 --> 01:06:38.637
<i>Every couple of weeks,</i>

1345
01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:41.389
<i>I sent Marino to the bosses
with a piece of what I made.</i>

1346
01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:43.892
<i>Not a big piece, but what did they know?</i>

1347
01:06:44.351 --> 01:06:46.269
<i>They were 1,500 miles away,</i>

1348
01:06:46.394 --> 01:06:48.355
<i>and I don't know anyone
who can see that far.</i>

1349
01:06:48.438 --> 01:06:50.232
<i>Their drop was a garage</i>

1350
01:06:50.315 --> 01:06:52.776
<i>where Remo and the guys hung
out and counted their millions.</i>

1351
01:06:53.443 --> 01:06:54.861
Hey, Frankie.

1352
01:06:54.945 --> 01:06:57.739
<i>The cops knew but they didn't give a fuck.</i>

1353
01:06:57.822 --> 01:06:59.449
Nicky sends his warmest regards.

1354
01:06:59.533 --> 01:07:01.493
<i>But I knew how to keep the bosses happy.</i>

1355
01:07:01.576 --> 01:07:05.080
<i>Whenever they gave me little jobs to
do, you know, to send a message,</i>

1356
01:07:05.163 --> 01:07:08.875
<i>I would carry things out to a T.</i>

1357
01:07:08.959 --> 01:07:13.171
<i>Like the time Tony Dogs,
the new maniac tough guy in town,</i>

1358
01:07:13.255 --> 01:07:15.423
<i>shot up one of Remo's bars.</i>

1359
01:07:19.761 --> 01:07:24.099
<i>Here's a guy kills two of Remo's
guys and a poor fucking waitress</i>

1360
01:07:24.182 --> 01:07:27.352
<i>who was just working on her night
off, of all things.</i>

1361
01:07:29.688 --> 01:07:33.108
<i>I mean, this guy's just begging
to be made an example of.</i>

1362
01:07:33.191 --> 01:07:36.695
Frankie, I want the names of all
the other people he had with him.

1363
01:07:36.778 --> 01:07:38.446
And I don't care what you have to do

1364
01:07:38.613 --> 01:07:40.282
to them to get them, understand?

1365
01:07:40.365 --> 01:07:42.117
I'll take care of it, Remo.

1366
01:07:42.867 --> 01:07:45.996
<i>To be truthful with
you, I had to admire this guy.</i>

1367
01:07:46.121 --> 01:07:48.832
<i>He was one of the toughest
Irishmen I ever met.</i>

1368
01:07:48.915 --> 01:07:51.334
<i>This son of a bitch was tough.</i>

1369
01:07:51.418 --> 01:07:52.961
<i>For two fucking days and nights</i>

1370
01:07:53.086 --> 01:07:54.588
<i>we beat the shit out of this guy.</i>

1371
01:07:54.671 --> 01:07:56.840
<i>We even stuck ice picks in his balls.</i>

1372
01:07:56.923 --> 01:07:59.926
He better give me a name or
I'm gonna give him yours, Frank.

1373
01:08:00.010 --> 01:08:01.136
Thanks a lot.

1374
01:08:01.219 --> 01:08:02.345
<i>But he never talked.</i>

1375
01:08:02.429 --> 01:08:04.055
You would've ratted by now.

1376
01:08:04.139 --> 01:08:06.766
<i>In the end,
I had to put his fucking head in a vise.</i>

1377
01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:09.436
Dogs, can you hear me, Dogs?

1378
01:08:09.894 --> 01:08:11.563
Listen to me, Antony.

1379
01:08:11.688 --> 01:08:13.398
I got your head in a fucking vise.

1380
01:08:13.481 --> 01:08:15.233
I'll squash your fucking head
like a grapefruit

1381
01:08:15.358 --> 01:08:17.152
if you don't give me a name.

1382
01:08:17.235 --> 01:08:19.487
Don't make me have to do this.

1383
01:08:20.113 --> 01:08:22.407
Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.

1384
01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:24.701
Fuck you.

1385
01:08:24.784 --> 01:08:26.286
Motherfucker. You believe this?

1386
01:08:26.411 --> 01:08:27.912
Two fucking days and nights.

1387
01:08:27.996 --> 01:08:31.124
Fuck me? Fuck me, you motherfucker?

1388
01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:34.085
Fuck my mother? That what you're saying?

1389
01:08:34.169 --> 01:08:35.837
You motherfucker, you, huh?

1390
01:08:37.505 --> 01:08:40.175
Oh, God. Give me the fucking name.

1391
01:08:40.258 --> 01:08:42.218
Charlie M.

1392
01:08:42.302 --> 01:08:43.762
- Charlie M.
- Charlie M?

1393
01:08:43.845 --> 01:08:47.432
Charlie M? You make me pop your
fucking eye out of your head

1394
01:08:47.515 --> 01:08:50.310
to protect that piece of shit, Charlie M?

1395
01:08:50.393 --> 01:08:52.103
You dumb motherfucker.

1396
01:08:52.187 --> 01:08:54.356
Kill me, you fuck. Kill me!

1397
01:08:54.522 --> 01:08:56.691
Kill you? You motherfucker, you.

1398
01:08:56.775 --> 01:08:59.402
Frankie, do him a fucking favor.

1399
01:08:59.486 --> 01:09:04.282
<i>The word got around that finally
there was a real gangster in town.</i>

1400
01:09:04.824 --> 01:09:07.452
<i>Nicky was the new boss of Las Vegas.</i>

1401
01:09:07.786 --> 01:09:09.120
Charlie M.

1402
01:09:13.667 --> 01:09:15.335
Four reels, sevens across.

1403
01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:17.128
Three $15,000 jackpots.

1404
01:09:17.212 --> 01:09:18.963
Do you have any idea what the odds are?

1405
01:09:19.047 --> 01:09:21.216
Shoot, it's gotta be
in the millions or more.

1406
01:09:21.299 --> 01:09:23.301
Three fucking jackpots in 20 minutes?

1407
01:09:23.426 --> 01:09:25.470
Why didn't you call me?

1408
01:09:25.553 --> 01:09:27.013
It happened so quick. Three guys won.

1409
01:09:27.138 --> 01:09:28.598
I didn't have a chance.

1410
01:09:28.682 --> 01:09:30.266
You didn't see the scam?

1411
01:09:30.392 --> 01:09:32.018
There's no way to determine that.

1412
01:09:32.102 --> 01:09:34.312
Yes, there is. An infallible way, they won!

1413
01:09:34.396 --> 01:09:37.357
It's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.

1414
01:09:37.691 --> 01:09:41.820
Ward, you're pissing me off.
Now you're insulting my intelligence.

1415
01:09:41.903 --> 01:09:44.155
You know somebody
had to get into those machines

1416
01:09:44.239 --> 01:09:45.407
and set those reels.

1417
01:09:45.490 --> 01:09:46.783
The probability on one machine

1418
01:09:46.908 --> 01:09:48.201
is a million-and-a-half to one.

1419
01:09:48.284 --> 01:09:51.329
On three machines in a row,
it's in the billions. It can't happen.

1420
01:09:51.413 --> 01:09:53.581
What's the matter with you?

1421
01:09:53.665 --> 01:09:56.376
Didn't you see you were being
set up on the second win?

1422
01:09:56.459 --> 01:09:58.503
You didn't see you were being set up?

1423
01:09:58.628 --> 01:10:00.714
I think you're overreacting.

1424
01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:04.342
You fucking yokel. I've been carrying
your ass ever since I got here.

1425
01:10:04.426 --> 01:10:06.344
Get your ass out of here.

1426
01:10:06.428 --> 01:10:08.138
- You're firing me?
- I'm firing you.

1427
01:10:08.221 --> 01:10:10.014
No, I'm not firing. I'm firing you.

1428
01:10:10.098 --> 01:10:11.683
You might regret this.

1429
01:10:11.808 --> 01:10:13.435
I'll regret it if I keep you.

1430
01:10:13.518 --> 01:10:15.019
This is not the way to treat people.

1431
01:10:15.103 --> 01:10:17.897
If you didn't see it,
you're too fucking dumb.

1432
01:10:17.981 --> 01:10:20.442
If you did see it, you were in on it.
Either way, you're out.

1433
01:10:20.525 --> 01:10:22.026
Go on. Let's go.

1434
01:10:23.987 --> 01:10:26.489
The guy's history as far as I'm concerned.

1435
01:10:26.573 --> 01:10:28.199
You can't fire him.

1436
01:10:28.324 --> 01:10:29.951
His brother-in-law is County Commissioner.

1437
01:10:30.034 --> 01:10:31.369
Everybody with cowboy boots

1438
01:10:31.453 --> 01:10:35.331
is a fucking county
commissioner or related to one.

1439
01:10:35.415 --> 01:10:37.333
This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge.

1440
01:10:37.417 --> 01:10:40.003
His brother-in-law runs
the County Commission.

1441
01:10:40.086 --> 01:10:41.838
There's gotta be a way to work him back in.

1442
01:10:41.921 --> 01:10:43.631
You're in the finances, you're upstairs.

1443
01:10:43.715 --> 01:10:44.883
You are not on the floor.

1444
01:10:45.008 --> 01:10:46.176
You don't see what's going on.

1445
01:10:46.259 --> 01:10:48.928
I've got thousands of
players, I've got 500 dealers.

1446
01:10:49.012 --> 01:10:51.723
They're all looking to rob
me blind 24 hours a day.

1447
01:10:51.806 --> 01:10:55.059
I have to let them know I'm watching
all the details all the time.

1448
01:10:55.143 --> 01:10:57.854
There is not one single thing
I will not catch.

1449
01:10:59.355 --> 01:11:02.066
Look at yours. Look at that.

1450
01:11:02.150 --> 01:11:04.402
Look at this. There's nothing.

1451
01:11:04.486 --> 01:11:08.281
Look how many blueberries your
muffin has and how many mine has.

1452
01:11:08.364 --> 01:11:10.158
What are you talking about?

1453
01:11:10.241 --> 01:11:12.410
If you don't do it yourself,
it never gets done.

1454
01:11:12.494 --> 01:11:13.995
Where are you going?

1455
01:11:15.497 --> 01:11:17.373
From now on,
I want you to put an equal amount

1456
01:11:17.499 --> 01:11:19.417
of blueberries in each muffin.

1457
01:11:20.001 --> 01:11:23.004
An equal amount of
blueberries in each muffin.

1458
01:11:24.047 --> 01:11:25.423
Do you know how long that will take?

1459
01:11:25.548 --> 01:11:26.925
I don't care.

1460
01:11:27.008 --> 01:11:29.761
Put an equal amount in each muffin.

1461
01:11:33.473 --> 01:11:35.600
Come on, honey, just a little.

1462
01:11:35.725 --> 01:11:37.894
Atta girl. Atta girl.

1463
01:11:37.977 --> 01:11:39.896
Oh, boy, look. You wanna go to Mommy?

1464
01:11:39.979 --> 01:11:41.356
Wanna come to Mommy?

1465
01:11:41.481 --> 01:11:42.816
It's all right, sweetheart.

1466
01:11:42.899 --> 01:11:46.820
I need to talk to you. I need some money.

1467
01:11:47.946 --> 01:11:48.947
What do you need?

1468
01:11:49.072 --> 01:11:50.073
Got her?

1469
01:11:51.866 --> 01:11:54.410
I need a lot. I need more than usual.

1470
01:11:54.494 --> 01:11:56.579
Why don't you take it out of your account?

1471
01:11:56.663 --> 01:11:59.916
I would, you know, Sam, it's just that...

1472
01:12:00.583 --> 01:12:03.336
Well, I need more than that. I need $25,000.

1473
01:12:04.170 --> 01:12:05.713
$25,000?

1474
01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.550
For yourself? Yeah.

1475
01:12:09.425 --> 01:12:11.511
Why do you need that much?

1476
01:12:11.594 --> 01:12:13.513
What's the difference? I just need it.

1477
01:12:13.596 --> 01:12:16.182
I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money.

1478
01:12:16.266 --> 01:12:18.059
You're not asking for a box of popcorn.

1479
01:12:18.142 --> 01:12:20.395
We don't have to turn this into a big deal.

1480
01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:22.730
Okay? We don't have to have a fight.

1481
01:12:22.814 --> 01:12:24.524
It was important to me. Forget it.

1482
01:12:24.607 --> 01:12:25.942
Just something I wanted to do.

1483
01:12:26.985 --> 01:12:30.071
Who's fighting? I mean,
tell me what it's for.

1484
01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:36.911
Why can't you tell me what it's for? Huh?

1485
01:12:39.831 --> 01:12:41.916
You know what? Now I want you to tell me.

1486
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.669
My wife comes to me and asks me for $25,000.

1487
01:12:44.752 --> 01:12:46.588
What do you want, a coat? No.

1488
01:12:46.671 --> 01:12:48.423
If you want a coat, you got it.

1489
01:12:48.506 --> 01:12:49.757
It's not the money.

1490
01:12:49.883 --> 01:12:51.134
It's just, why do you want it?

1491
01:12:51.217 --> 01:12:52.802
Am I not entitled to ask?

1492
01:12:52.886 --> 01:12:54.596
I've been independent my whole life.

1493
01:12:54.762 --> 01:12:56.514
I never had to ask anybody for anything.

1494
01:12:56.598 --> 01:12:58.182
Now you're making me beg.

1495
01:12:58.308 --> 01:12:59.893
What are you talking about?

1496
01:12:59.976 --> 01:13:01.603
And you're embarrassing me.

1497
01:13:01.769 --> 01:13:03.396
Why do you want to make me feel so bad?

1498
01:13:03.479 --> 01:13:05.106
You're asking me for $25,000.

1499
01:13:05.231 --> 01:13:06.858
I'm not out to make you feel bad.

1500
01:13:06.941 --> 01:13:08.526
I want to just be able to trust you.

1501
01:13:08.610 --> 01:13:09.944
You know, it's about trust.

1502
01:13:11.696 --> 01:13:13.948
I have to be able to trust you with my life.

1503
01:13:14.032 --> 01:13:15.617
Do you understand?

1504
01:13:16.826 --> 01:13:18.286
Can I trust you?

1505
01:13:22.457 --> 01:13:24.042
Can I trust you?

1506
01:13:26.002 --> 01:13:27.587
Can I trust you?

1507
01:13:27.670 --> 01:13:29.547
Answer me, can I trust you?

1508
01:13:31.174 --> 01:13:32.842
You can trust me.

1509
01:13:32.967 --> 01:13:34.636
Good. Then tell me what the money is for.

1510
01:13:39.057 --> 01:13:42.310
<i>You've got to</i>

1511
01:13:43.269 --> 01:13:45.188
<i>Give a little</i>

1512
01:13:46.731 --> 01:13:49.150
<i>Take a little</i>

1513
01:13:50.652 --> 01:13:53.947
<i>And let your poor heart</i>

1514
01:13:54.364 --> 01:13:56.783
<i>Break a little</i>

1515
01:13:56.950 --> 01:13:59.035
Yeah, she's leaving the bank now.

1516
01:13:59.827 --> 01:14:01.829
All right, I'm gonna follow her.

1517
01:14:02.413 --> 01:14:04.207
What is that? What does that mean?

1518
01:14:04.332 --> 01:14:06.167
I know that look. What does that look mean?

1519
01:14:06.250 --> 01:14:08.002
It means I got the money.

1520
01:14:08.169 --> 01:14:09.921
That's a good look.

1521
01:14:10.338 --> 01:14:12.715
<i>You've got to</i>

1522
01:14:27.230 --> 01:14:30.191
How are you doing, Les? It's Lester, right?

1523
01:14:31.150 --> 01:14:32.527
Sam.

1524
01:14:37.573 --> 01:14:40.326
From my recollection,
aren't you the card shark,

1525
01:14:41.536 --> 01:14:44.497
the golf hustler,
the pimp from Beverly Hills?

1526
01:14:47.208 --> 01:14:49.168
If I'm wrong, please correct me,

1527
01:14:49.293 --> 01:14:51.212
'cause I never knew you to be a heist man.

1528
01:14:51.379 --> 01:14:53.339
But if you are, you know what?

1529
01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:56.009
Here, take mine, too.

1530
01:14:56.634 --> 01:14:57.927
Go ahead, take it.

1531
01:14:58.052 --> 01:14:59.387
'Cause you already have hers.

1532
01:15:00.263 --> 01:15:01.806
She's my wife.

1533
01:15:02.932 --> 01:15:04.892
Look at me. You did know that?

1534
01:15:05.018 --> 01:15:06.978
You knew that she's my wife?

1535
01:15:07.562 --> 01:15:08.646
Huh? Hey, look at me.

1536
01:15:08.771 --> 01:15:09.897
Yeah, I know that.

1537
01:15:09.981 --> 01:15:11.607
You do, yeah?

1538
01:15:14.736 --> 01:15:17.530
But if you ever come back again, ever,

1539
01:15:17.947 --> 01:15:20.742
to take her money, next time bring a pistol.

1540
01:15:20.825 --> 01:15:22.660
That way you got a chance.

1541
01:15:22.744 --> 01:15:24.746
Be a man. Don't be a fucking pimp.

1542
01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:27.790
Now, you wanna do me a favor?

1543
01:15:27.915 --> 01:15:29.625
Get out of here.

1544
01:15:29.876 --> 01:15:31.169
I wanna be alone with my wife.

1545
01:15:31.252 --> 01:15:33.004
Get the fuck up and get out of here.

1546
01:15:40.428 --> 01:15:42.096
Fucking piece of shit.

1547
01:15:42.221 --> 01:15:43.848
That's fucking bullshit.

1548
01:15:43.931 --> 01:15:46.851
You know? That's fucking...

1549
01:15:46.934 --> 01:15:49.353
<i>I guess it's best that we should part</i>

1550
01:15:49.479 --> 01:15:51.939
<i>That's the glory of love</i>

1551
01:15:52.565 --> 01:15:56.152
Remember when you called him
that night and said goodbye?

1552
01:15:56.235 --> 01:15:59.614
He didn't say, "Don't get
married, I'll be right down."

1553
01:15:59.947 --> 01:16:01.282
No, he didn't.

1554
01:16:01.449 --> 01:16:02.825
No. Instead, what did he say?

1555
01:16:06.037 --> 01:16:09.248
"Fuck him.
Take him for everything he's got."

1556
01:16:09.707 --> 01:16:12.126
Come here. I want to show you something.

1557
01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:15.838
<i>That's the story</i>

1558
01:16:15.963 --> 01:16:17.965
<i>The second letter came right after</i>

1559
01:16:19.217 --> 01:16:21.302
Come back, you motherfucker.

1560
01:16:21.385 --> 01:16:24.180
No! No, no!

1561
01:16:25.431 --> 01:16:27.517
Make them stop it!

1562
01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.602
No!

1563
01:16:30.186 --> 01:16:32.313
No! No.

1564
01:16:32.730 --> 01:16:36.484
It's not his fault! It's my fault!

1565
01:16:42.824 --> 01:16:45.076
No!

1566
01:16:48.246 --> 01:16:49.914
Fuck!

1567
01:16:50.039 --> 01:16:51.749
Piece of shit.

1568
01:16:59.674 --> 01:17:02.927
Why didn't you do it
yourself, you chickenshit cocksucker?

1569
01:17:03.928 --> 01:17:05.847
He's such a prick!

1570
01:17:05.930 --> 01:17:08.432
He had some guy from the hotel beat him up.

1571
01:17:08.933 --> 01:17:10.518
He didn't want to do it himself.

1572
01:17:10.601 --> 01:17:13.646
Oh, no, he didn't want
to get his own hands dirty.

1573
01:17:15.982 --> 01:17:18.401
So why did he have to do that, huh?

1574
01:17:18.484 --> 01:17:19.986
Tell me.

1575
01:17:20.736 --> 01:17:22.113
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do...

1576
01:17:22.238 --> 01:17:23.614
No shit.

1577
01:17:23.698 --> 01:17:24.699
You gotta understand,

1578
01:17:24.824 --> 01:17:27.034
he doesn't know if this guy
is shaking you down...

1579
01:17:27.118 --> 01:17:28.661
No. No.

1580
01:17:29.203 --> 01:17:32.123
I told him about this guy
before we got married.

1581
01:17:32.206 --> 01:17:33.833
This is no fucking surprise.

1582
01:17:33.875 --> 01:17:35.877
Yeah. Oh, you did? I didn't know that.

1583
01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:39.297
He's just a friend of mine I
was trying to help. So what?

1584
01:17:39.547 --> 01:17:43.718
You know, the first time
I ever saw you guys together,

1585
01:17:44.302 --> 01:17:46.304
I never saw him so happy.

1586
01:17:46.721 --> 01:17:49.724
I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything,

1587
01:17:49.891 --> 01:17:53.477
out I never seen him act
like that with anybody else.

1588
01:17:54.437 --> 01:17:56.230
I think he's crazy about you.

1589
01:17:56.355 --> 01:17:58.107
I mean, he really loves you. He does.

1590
01:17:58.191 --> 01:18:01.694
Come on. I went into this
with my eyes open, you know.

1591
01:18:01.777 --> 01:18:04.530
I knew the bottom
could drop out at any time.

1592
01:18:04.614 --> 01:18:08.117
I'm & working girl. You don't think
I'm gonna go into 2 situation like this

1593
01:18:08.201 --> 01:18:10.369
if I don't think I'm gonna
get covered on the back end?

1594
01:18:10.453 --> 01:18:11.579
- Sure, I can see that.
- Right?

1595
01:18:13.497 --> 01:18:15.208
So he put aside some jewelry for me.

1596
01:18:15.333 --> 01:18:17.084
A lot of jewelry.

1597
01:18:17.168 --> 01:18:18.669
You mean like a lot of expensive jewelry?

1598
01:18:18.794 --> 01:18:20.338
About how much?

1599
01:18:20.671 --> 01:18:22.882
You want to steal it?

1600
01:18:23.007 --> 01:18:25.176
No. I'm just curious.

1601
01:18:25.259 --> 01:18:29.096
I was wondering, how much he
would put into a thing like that.

1602
01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:31.849
I'm told it's worth about $1
million, maybe more.

1603
01:18:31.933 --> 01:18:34.060
Well, there you go. What does that tell you?

1604
01:18:34.185 --> 01:18:36.312
$1 million in jewelry.

1605
01:18:36.646 --> 01:18:39.023
The guy is crazy about you.

1606
01:18:39.106 --> 01:18:40.858
I should've never married him.

1607
01:18:40.983 --> 01:18:42.693
He's a Gemini.

1608
01:18:42.777 --> 01:18:45.363
Triple Gemini. Duality.

1609
01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:47.281
Gemini is the snake, you know.

1610
01:18:47.406 --> 01:18:48.866
You can't trust a snake.

1611
01:18:50.952 --> 01:18:52.161
I mean it.

1612
01:18:52.286 --> 01:18:53.496
I know what you mean.

1613
01:18:53.788 --> 01:18:55.331
Listen, Ginger.

1614
01:18:55.998 --> 01:18:57.708
You know, this is probably not...

1615
01:18:57.833 --> 01:18:59.585
I don't have the answers anyway.

1616
01:18:59.961 --> 01:19:01.504
This is probably not
what you want to hear...

1617
01:19:01.629 --> 01:19:03.506
- I do.
- ...'cause you're a little upset with Ace

1618
01:19:03.589 --> 01:19:05.174
and I understand that.

1619
01:19:06.008 --> 01:19:08.094
But I think you should try
to make the best of it now.

1620
01:19:08.219 --> 01:19:10.304
Go slow. See what happens.

1621
01:19:10.388 --> 01:19:12.431
He could've killed him! Okay?

1622
01:19:12.556 --> 01:19:14.558
He didn't have to hit him.

1623
01:19:14.642 --> 01:19:16.560
It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy.

1624
01:19:16.644 --> 01:19:19.230
He makes me sneak around
to see my own friends.

1625
01:19:19.313 --> 01:19:21.232
What the fuck is that all about?

1626
01:19:21.315 --> 01:19:24.860
I guess it's 'cause he loves you so
much, he's jealous and worried.

1627
01:19:25.319 --> 01:19:27.488
Like he gives a fuck what I do.

1628
01:19:29.073 --> 01:19:30.700
I'll try to find out
what the hell is going on.

1629
01:19:30.825 --> 01:19:32.451
When I see him, I'll talk to him.

1630
01:19:32.535 --> 01:19:33.703
Okay.

1631
01:19:33.995 --> 01:19:35.705
- Yeah.
- All right?

1632
01:19:36.998 --> 01:19:41.002
Thanks. Thanks for putting up with me.

1633
01:19:41.085 --> 01:19:42.795
Take it easy with this shit.

1634
01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:44.588
This can only make matters worse.

1635
01:19:44.672 --> 01:19:45.715
You're a beautiful girl.

1636
01:19:45.881 --> 01:19:48.509
I've seen a lot of girls
get shot to hell from this.

1637
01:19:50.636 --> 01:19:52.096
You're so nice.

1638
01:19:52.638 --> 01:19:53.973
Come on, now.

1639
01:19:54.098 --> 01:19:55.433
I don't wanna see you unhappy.

1640
01:19:58.019 --> 01:19:59.645
Thanks.

1641
01:20:03.107 --> 01:20:04.233
Thank you.

1642
01:20:04.358 --> 01:20:05.526
It's all right.

1643
01:20:18.789 --> 01:20:21.959
Mr. Rothstein, County Commissioner
Pat Webb is here to see you.

1644
01:20:22.043 --> 01:20:23.461
- <i>Give me a minute.</i>
- Okay.

1645
01:20:23.544 --> 01:20:24.754
He'll be just a minute.

1646
01:20:42.063 --> 01:20:44.523
Mr. Webb, can I get you anything?

1647
01:20:44.607 --> 01:20:46.942
No, thank you, little lady.

1648
01:20:47.193 --> 01:20:49.570
Okay, send him in,
call me four minutes after.

1649
01:20:49.653 --> 01:20:52.448
Mr. Rothstein, I'm Pat Webb.

1650
01:20:52.948 --> 01:20:53.991
How do you do?

1651
01:20:54.075 --> 01:20:55.951
- It is a pleasure.
- I've heard a lot about you.

1652
01:20:56.035 --> 01:20:59.413
Oh, thank you, sir.
Hey, house is doing well.

1653
01:20:59.789 --> 01:21:02.375
Hey, all that money is rolling in.

1654
01:21:02.458 --> 01:21:05.503
I appreciate you taking the time
to see a poor civil servant.

1655
01:21:05.586 --> 01:21:06.837
Why don't you have a seat?

1656
01:21:06.962 --> 01:21:08.255
Thank you, sir.

1657
01:21:08.881 --> 01:21:12.510
I come here personally
to kind of smooth over

1658
01:21:12.593 --> 01:21:14.553
any fracas about a certain matter.

1659
01:21:14.637 --> 01:21:16.597
Maybe you didn't know it,

1660
01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:19.809
but Don Ward is a very
well-liked man in this town.

1661
01:21:19.892 --> 01:21:22.019
He's got lots of friends, nice family

1662
01:21:22.144 --> 01:21:24.271
and their money go back many, many years.

1663
01:21:24.355 --> 01:21:27.858
Now, friends vote. Family and money votes.

1664
01:21:27.942 --> 01:21:30.945
That's important to me and you.

1665
01:21:31.028 --> 01:21:35.741
And if you'll think about our
little problem along them lines,

1666
01:21:36.617 --> 01:21:38.702
and you'll forgive me for saying it,

1667
01:21:38.786 --> 01:21:41.455
maybe he did not deserve to be fired.

1668
01:21:42.373 --> 01:21:45.418
He knew about our getting hit
on three big machines in a row

1669
01:21:45.501 --> 01:21:46.919
and he did nothing about it.

1670
01:21:47.002 --> 01:21:51.590
So he was in on it or he was too
dumb to see what was going on.

1671
01:21:51.674 --> 01:21:54.051
Either way, I cannot have a
man like that working here.

1672
01:21:54.135 --> 01:21:57.513
Before we point the dirty end
of the stick at old Don,

1673
01:21:57.596 --> 01:22:00.182
we better be sure we can prove them charges.

1674
01:22:00.266 --> 01:22:02.893
Believe me, if I could prove
it, he would be under arrest.

1675
01:22:04.103 --> 01:22:05.104
Are...

1676
01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:10.234
Are we certain that you want
the Gaming Control Board

1677
01:22:10.317 --> 01:22:14.113
eyeballing your record and your
gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?

1678
01:22:14.196 --> 01:22:16.532
You're way out of line
talking to me like that.

1679
01:22:16.615 --> 01:22:21.162
That's libelous and you're in no
position to challenge my expertise.

1680
01:22:21.245 --> 01:22:24.457
I went way out of my way to
be very helpful to that kid.

1681
01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:26.459
He's weak. He's incompetent.

1682
01:22:26.584 --> 01:22:28.502
He jeopardizes the whole place.

1683
01:22:28.586 --> 01:22:30.379
There's not much more I can do for him.

1684
01:22:30.504 --> 01:22:31.714
You have got me there.

1685
01:22:33.048 --> 01:22:36.260
Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.

1686
01:22:37.595 --> 01:22:39.847
But he is my brother-in-law

1687
01:22:40.514 --> 01:22:43.017
and I would look on it as a personal favor

1688
01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:45.060
if you'd think some more on hiring him back.

1689
01:22:46.270 --> 01:22:47.855
I can't do that.

1690
01:22:48.314 --> 01:22:52.067
I appreciate that he's your
brother-in-law and I do want to help you.

1691
01:22:52.151 --> 01:22:53.569
I like to do favors.

1692
01:22:53.652 --> 01:22:55.863
And I know who you are but I cannot do that.

1693
01:22:58.199 --> 01:23:03.537
Well, could there be any
position farther down the trough?

1694
01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:08.000
I'm sorry, I can't do anything.

1695
01:23:08.083 --> 01:23:11.212
He's too incompetent
and he cannot be trusted.

1696
01:23:14.381 --> 01:23:16.050
Okay. Thanks.

1697
01:23:18.052 --> 01:23:21.055
No. That's it. I'm sorry.

1698
01:23:21.847 --> 01:23:27.061
Mr. Rothstein, your people never will
understand the way it works out here.

1699
01:23:28.062 --> 01:23:30.231
You're all just our guests.

1700
01:23:30.731 --> 01:23:32.733
But you act like you're at home.

1701
01:23:33.067 --> 01:23:34.610
Let me tell you something, partner.

1702
01:23:34.735 --> 01:23:36.320
You ain't home.

1703
01:23:36.987 --> 01:23:40.324
But that's where we're gonna send
you if it harelips the Governor.

1704
01:23:43.327 --> 01:23:44.662
Thank you for your time.

1705
01:23:44.787 --> 01:23:46.121
No problem.

1706
01:23:47.081 --> 01:23:48.082
Sorry.

1707
01:23:48.249 --> 01:23:49.291
You bet.

1708
01:23:54.255 --> 01:23:56.006
What happened to my pills?

1709
01:23:58.634 --> 01:24:00.177
Your drinking is bad enough.

1710
01:24:00.302 --> 01:24:01.845
You're taking my pills, too?

1711
01:24:01.929 --> 01:24:03.514
I didn't take your pills.

1712
01:24:03.597 --> 01:24:06.225
Look, for my ulcer,
I take a half of one of these

1713
01:24:06.308 --> 01:24:09.353
and that's when I have extreme pain.

1714
01:24:09.436 --> 01:24:10.854
I had a three-month supply.

1715
01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:12.439
What did you do with them?

1716
01:24:12.773 --> 01:24:14.441
You didn't have to beat him up.

1717
01:24:14.567 --> 01:24:16.193
What?

1718
01:24:17.152 --> 01:24:19.321
I was just trying to help him.

1719
01:24:20.614 --> 01:24:22.575
It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy.

1720
01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:24.618
Yeah, how do I know?

1721
01:24:25.661 --> 01:24:29.623
You can't make me stop caring
about people. What? What?

1722
01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:36.213
I said, you can't make me
stop caring about people.

1723
01:24:42.928 --> 01:24:44.346
Listen.

1724
01:24:45.639 --> 01:24:49.476
Ginger, I'm trying to make the
best of everything here, you know?

1725
01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:52.062
I mean, you're my wife, for Christ's sakes.

1726
01:24:52.146 --> 01:24:55.232
I mean, people look up to you in this town.
I don't know what to do...

1727
01:24:55.649 --> 01:24:59.069
You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit!

1728
01:24:59.153 --> 01:25:02.364
I'm getting out of here. I am.

1729
01:25:08.621 --> 01:25:09.622
You gotta get hold of yourself.

1730
01:25:09.747 --> 01:25:10.748
Okay.

1731
01:25:10.831 --> 01:25:11.999
If not for me, at least for Amy.

1732
01:25:12.124 --> 01:25:13.250
Okay.

1733
01:25:13.334 --> 01:25:14.668
Understand?

1734
01:25:14.835 --> 01:25:16.170
Your drinking's getting way out of hand.

1735
01:25:16.253 --> 01:25:17.921
I'm gonna get you into & program.

1736
01:25:18.047 --> 01:25:19.715
They got plenty of good ones.

1737
01:25:20.007 --> 01:25:21.550
I don't need one.

1738
01:25:21.675 --> 01:25:23.218
Yes, you do. It's very discreet.

1739
01:25:23.302 --> 01:25:25.262
There's no names in the papers.

1740
01:25:25.346 --> 01:25:27.348
That's all you care about.

1741
01:25:29.058 --> 01:25:30.351
You don't care about me.

1742
01:25:30.476 --> 01:25:31.769
Um

1743
01:25:31.852 --> 01:25:33.937
- No, you don't.
- How could you say that?

1744
01:25:34.021 --> 01:25:37.024
You're a beautiful woman,
you're destroying yourself.

1745
01:25:37.107 --> 01:25:38.400
You don't need that.

1746
01:25:38.484 --> 01:25:40.486
You don't need that fucking
leech living off you.

1747
01:25:41.028 --> 01:25:43.113
I know you better than you know yourself.

1748
01:25:43.238 --> 01:25:45.324
You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am.

1749
01:25:45.407 --> 01:25:47.326
When you set your mind on doing something,

1750
01:25:47.451 --> 01:25:49.370
you do it better than anybody.

1751
01:25:53.874 --> 01:25:56.585
You're gonna do it. Okay? You'll do it.

1752
01:25:56.669 --> 01:25:58.003
Oh, God.

1753
01:25:59.296 --> 01:26:00.547
Oh, God.

1754
01:26:02.883 --> 01:26:05.844
Okay. Okay.

1755
01:26:07.721 --> 01:26:10.057
I'll try. I'll try.

1756
01:26:10.224 --> 01:26:13.727
I'll try. I Will.

1757
01:26:14.978 --> 01:26:17.147
Don't be mad at me, okay?

1758
01:26:18.524 --> 01:26:19.900
I will.

1759
01:26:29.201 --> 01:26:32.037
<i>No matter what the problems
were outside the count room,</i>

1760
01:26:32.830 --> 01:26:34.832
<i>it was all worth it.</i>

1761
01:26:34.915 --> 01:26:37.000
<i>The cash kept rolling in</i>

1762
01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:40.421
<i>and the suitcases kept coming and going.</i>

1763
01:26:41.296 --> 01:26:46.051
<i>And let me tell you,
the fucking bottom line here is cash.</i>

1764
01:26:47.428 --> 01:26:49.805
<i>The only problem was that after a while,</i>

1765
01:26:49.888 --> 01:26:53.934
<i>the bosses noticed that the suitcases
were getting a little light.</i>

1766
01:26:54.393 --> 01:26:56.937
Wait a minute. You mean to tell me

1767
01:26:57.104 --> 01:26:59.648
that the money we're
robbing is being robbed?

1768
01:26:59.732 --> 01:27:01.608
That somebody's robbing from us?

1769
01:27:01.692 --> 01:27:04.862
We go through all this trouble
and somebody's robbing us?

1770
01:27:05.404 --> 01:27:07.448
Like I said, it's part of the business.

1771
01:27:07.573 --> 01:27:09.575
It's considered leakage.

1772
01:27:09.658 --> 01:27:10.909
Leakage, my balls.

1773
01:27:11.034 --> 01:27:12.244
I want the guy who's robbing us.

1774
01:27:12.327 --> 01:27:14.997
<i>Even John Nance,
that's the guy who ran the scam,</i>

1775
01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:17.166
<i>he knew there wasn't much
he could do about it.</i>

1776
01:27:17.249 --> 01:27:19.585
<i>You gotta know that a
guy who helps you steal,</i>

1777
01:27:19.668 --> 01:27:21.712
<i>even if you take care of him real well,</i>

1778
01:27:21.795 --> 01:27:24.089
<i>he's gonna steal a little extra for himself.</i>

1779
01:27:24.214 --> 01:27:26.550
<i>Makes sense, don't it? Right?</i>

1780
01:27:26.633 --> 01:27:30.012
<i>Try and make these hardheaded
old grease balls understand that.</i>

1781
01:27:30.095 --> 01:27:32.598
What's the point of skimming
if we're being skimmed?

1782
01:27:32.681 --> 01:27:34.975
It defeats the purpose.

1783
01:27:35.642 --> 01:27:37.811
They take money because they're my guys,

1784
01:27:37.978 --> 01:27:40.147
so you gotta give them some leeway.

1785
01:27:40.481 --> 01:27:44.401
<i>But the bosses never believed in
leeway, so listen to what they do.</i>

1786
01:27:44.485 --> 01:27:47.446
<i>They put Artie Piscano,
the underboss of K.C.</i>

1787
01:27:47.529 --> 01:27:51.158
<i>in charge of making sure
nobody skimmed the skim.</i>

1788
01:27:51.241 --> 01:27:52.409
What were you doing?

1789
01:27:52.534 --> 01:27:53.702
I was with my <i>goomah.</i>

1790
01:27:53.786 --> 01:27:55.329
What are you doing with your <i>goomah</i>?

1791
01:27:55.496 --> 01:27:57.039
I gave her a schiaffo.

1792
01:27:57.122 --> 01:27:59.833
<i>The only trouble was Piscano was a disaster.</i>

1793
01:27:59.917 --> 01:28:01.960
<i>This guy could fuck up a cup of coffee.</i>

1794
01:28:02.044 --> 01:28:03.378
What you been doing?

1795
01:28:03.504 --> 01:28:04.880
I'm out there more than I'm here.

1796
01:28:04.963 --> 01:28:07.758
<i>And if anybody had
known where this would lead,</i>

1797
01:28:07.841 --> 01:28:11.053
<i>they would've been better off
making fucking novenas.</i>

1798
01:28:11.136 --> 01:28:13.013
You gotta go back and talk to that guy.

1799
01:28:13.096 --> 01:28:14.848
I never got my expenses for the last trip.

1800
01:28:14.973 --> 01:28:16.725
<i>What expenses?</i>

1801
01:28:16.809 --> 01:28:18.602
I'm laying money out of my own pocket

1802
01:28:18.727 --> 01:28:20.562
and I never get anything back.

1803
01:28:20.646 --> 01:28:22.356
You gotta go back out there.

1804
01:28:22.481 --> 01:28:24.149
I'm gonna start keeping records.

1805
01:28:24.233 --> 01:28:26.193
No records, Artie.

1806
01:28:26.318 --> 01:28:28.237
What are you gonna do
with records, pay taxes?

1807
01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:31.865
I can't keep laying out my own
fucking dough for these trips.

1808
01:28:31.949 --> 01:28:33.951
What the hell are we doing over here?

1809
01:28:34.034 --> 01:28:37.120
You're going to Las Vegas at my expense.

1810
01:28:37.204 --> 01:28:39.122
What the fuck? I mean, after all...

1811
01:28:39.206 --> 01:28:41.041
<i>No matter how many novenas you could make,</i>

1812
01:28:41.124 --> 01:28:43.794
<i>nothing was gonna stop what came up next.</i>

1813
01:28:43.877 --> 01:28:45.546
I can't believe you're doing this.

1814
01:28:45.671 --> 01:28:47.297
We made a deal. You came to me.

1815
01:28:47.381 --> 01:28:49.299
<i>It turned out Phil Green, "Mr. Integrity,"</i>

1816
01:28:49.424 --> 01:28:51.385
<i>had a partner nobody knew about</i>

1817
01:28:51.468 --> 01:28:54.847
<i>and when she showed up,
demanding money from the Tangiers...</i>

1818
01:28:54.930 --> 01:28:56.223
Why are you doing this?

1819
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:57.683
Because you're wrong.

1820
01:28:57.766 --> 01:28:59.142
I'm not. Yes, you are.

1821
01:28:59.226 --> 01:29:00.352
I am not wrong.

1822
01:29:00.435 --> 01:29:02.104
<i>...Green tried to stonewall her.</i>

1823
01:29:02.187 --> 01:29:04.731
I will see to it that you
do not get away with this.

1824
01:29:04.815 --> 01:29:06.483
<i>So she sued him in court.</i>

1825
01:29:06.567 --> 01:29:09.194
The court will now hear the matter
of the plaintiff, Anna Scott,

1826
01:29:09.278 --> 01:29:12.948
against Tangiers Corporation
and its President, Philip Green.

1827
01:29:13.574 --> 01:29:15.325
John Marmot on behalf of Mr. Green.

1828
01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:17.244
Victor Oberon on behalf of Anna Scott.

1829
01:29:17.327 --> 01:29:18.453
Mr. Oberon, proceed.

1830
01:29:18.579 --> 01:29:19.997
Thank you, Judge.

1831
01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:23.500
I believe he was fair,
and I'm delighted with the decision.

1832
01:29:23.584 --> 01:29:25.127
We got a problem.

1833
01:29:28.422 --> 01:29:30.132
<i>It didn't go too well.</i>

1834
01:29:30.215 --> 01:29:31.925
Green has to open up the books,

1835
01:29:32.050 --> 01:29:33.760
has to show how he got the financing.

1836
01:29:33.844 --> 01:29:36.138
And hey, that's not good.

1837
01:29:39.683 --> 01:29:41.685
<i>She was doing pretty good with her lawsuit.</i>

1838
01:29:41.768 --> 01:29:43.979
<i>But before she could start
counting her money,</i>

1839
01:29:44.062 --> 01:29:47.357
<i>the boys back home decided to
settle the case out of court.</i>

1840
01:29:47.441 --> 01:29:48.817
<i>So they sent me.</i>

1841
01:30:04.875 --> 01:30:06.543
Can you comment on Anna Scott's murder?

1842
01:30:06.668 --> 01:30:08.337
What?

1843
01:30:08.420 --> 01:30:11.048
She was found last night, shot in the head.

1844
01:30:11.131 --> 01:30:13.133
Was this just a real estate partnership?

1845
01:30:13.300 --> 01:30:15.302
Her lawyer said you were partners.

1846
01:30:15.385 --> 01:30:19.056
We were involved in minor real
estate deals many years ago.

1847
01:30:19.139 --> 01:30:20.974
It was never a partnership.

1848
01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:24.645
Did you ever hear of the .22 caliber killer?

1849
01:30:24.978 --> 01:30:27.230
<i>Now, instead of the
cops only looking at Nicky,</i>

1850
01:30:27.356 --> 01:30:29.566
<i>they started looking at Green, too.</i>

1851
01:30:29.650 --> 01:30:32.402
<i>And he was supposed to be
our squeaky-clean front man.</i>

1852
01:30:32.486 --> 01:30:34.237
I had to start giving interviews

1853
01:30:34.321 --> 01:30:37.074
<i>so everybody knew the casino
was on the up-and-up.</i>

1854
01:30:37.157 --> 01:30:40.035
So how often do you really fill in for him?

1855
01:30:43.330 --> 01:30:45.832
Green's here about two
or three times a month

1856
01:30:45.958 --> 01:30:48.418
and he's busy with real estate deals.

1857
01:30:49.378 --> 01:30:51.463
So in Green's absence, you're the boss?

1858
01:30:52.381 --> 01:30:55.425
I serve at the pleasure
of the Chairman of the Board

1859
01:30:56.051 --> 01:31:00.180
and my responsibilities are to
run the day-to-day operations.

1860
01:31:00.263 --> 01:31:02.140
So day-to-day, then, you're the boss?

1861
01:31:02.224 --> 01:31:05.018
Well, in & sense, you could say that

1862
01:31:05.519 --> 01:31:08.855
I am the boss when Mr. Green is away.

1863
01:31:11.233 --> 01:31:12.776
You could say that.

1864
01:31:14.236 --> 01:31:17.531
Have you read this?
It's about Mr. Rothstein.

1865
01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:21.660
It says, "The Midwest
bookmaker with mob ties

1866
01:31:21.743 --> 01:31:23.203
"says that he is the real boss

1867
01:31:23.328 --> 01:31:25.872
of the $100 million Tangiers casino empire."

1868
01:31:26.623 --> 01:31:27.958
Do you believe that?

1869
01:31:28.083 --> 01:31:29.418
Did he really say that?

1870
01:31:29.501 --> 01:31:32.295
Why, of course he said that.
It's right here.

1871
01:31:33.046 --> 01:31:36.258
Has that man even filed for his license yet?

1872
01:31:36.341 --> 01:31:38.427
I don't know. We have to check the files.

1873
01:31:38.510 --> 01:31:41.680
Without getting your shorts in &
knot, would you do that?

1874
01:31:41.763 --> 01:31:45.767
Check closely, 'cause we may have
to kick a kike's ass out of town.

1875
01:31:46.977 --> 01:31:48.311
Thank you.

I gotta meet Clean Face.
What about the Chez Paris?

1883
01:32:15.922 --> 01:32:18.216
You can't. You gotta make a reservation.
It's all booked up.

1884
01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:20.927
No, no. It's <i>okay.</i> It's impossible.

1885

It's difficult to get in.

It's okay, I'll use the service entrance.
I'll see you at 9:00.

You can't let this concern you, Ace.

1903
01:33:23.156 --> 01:33:24.908
Don't worry about that stuff.

1904
01:33:24.991 --> 01:33:27.077
It's just a political witch hunt.

1905
01:33:31.456 --> 01:33:32.958
Hey, Ace.

1906
01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:36.294
Do you want something to drink?

1907
01:33:36.419 --> 01:33:37.963
Charlie, a refill?

1908
01:33:38.046 --> 01:33:39.714
- Yeah, refill would be great.
- No.

1909
01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:41.508
Hey, Mr. Clark.

1910
01:33:41.758 --> 01:33:43.969
You're tougher to reach than the President.

1911
01:33:44.052 --> 01:33:45.512
I've been busy.

1912
01:33:45.595 --> 01:33:48.014
Least you could do is return my phone calls.

1913
01:33:48.098 --> 01:33:51.184
Listen, Nicky, we talked about this.

1914
01:33:51.852 --> 01:33:56.606
And I explained to you that you
might have to take some kind of loss.

1915
01:33:57.774 --> 01:33:58.984
Yeah.

1916
01:33:59.901 --> 01:34:01.486
I think I want my money back.

1917
01:34:03.029 --> 01:34:05.657
What are you gonna do, strong-arm me?

1918
01:34:06.867 --> 01:34:08.535
You know, I think you've gotten

1919
01:34:08.660 --> 01:34:10.328
the wrong impression about me.

1920
01:34:11.037 --> 01:34:13.373
I think, in all fairness, I should explain

1921
01:34:13.540 --> 01:34:15.876
to you exactly what it is that I do.

1922
01:34:16.793 --> 01:34:21.256
Tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and
early, take a walk to the bank,

1923
01:34:21.798 --> 01:34:25.343
walk in and see you,
and if you don't have my money for me,

1924
01:34:25.427 --> 01:34:29.139
I'll crack your fucking head
wide open in front of everybody.

1925
01:34:29.431 --> 01:34:32.350
And just about the time
that I'm coming out of jail,

1926
01:34:32.809 --> 01:34:36.021
hopefully,
you'll be coming out of your coma.

1927
01:34:36.563 --> 01:34:38.315
And guess what?

1928
01:34:38.398 --> 01:34:42.194
I'll split your fucking head open
again, 'cause I'm fucking stupid.

1929
01:34:42.277 --> 01:34:44.362
I don't give a fuck about jail.

1930
01:34:44.446 --> 01:34:47.490
That's my business, that's what I do.

1931
01:34:48.158 --> 01:34:49.993
We know what you do.

1932
01:34:50.076 --> 01:34:52.204
You fuck people out of money
and get away with it.

1933
01:34:52.287 --> 01:34:53.872
You can't talk to me like that.

1934
01:34:53.997 --> 01:34:55.540
You put my money to sleep!

1935
01:34:55.624 --> 01:34:58.043
Get my money or I'll
put your brain to sleep.

1936
01:34:58.126 --> 01:34:59.211
Sam.

1937
01:34:59.336 --> 01:35:00.420
Never mind Sam. This is personal.

1938
01:35:00.503 --> 01:35:01.755
I'll be there in the morning.

1939
01:35:01.838 --> 01:35:04.007
You can try me, fatso. You fucking try me.

1940
01:35:06.343 --> 01:35:07.594
You think he got the point?

1941
01:35:07.677 --> 01:35:10.680
He's a square guy, for Christ's sakes.

1942
01:35:10.764 --> 01:35:12.432
He's gonna run to the FBI.

1943
01:35:12.515 --> 01:35:13.850
Fuck the FBI.

1944
01:35:13.934 --> 01:35:16.269
That prick's been dodging me
for three weeks.

1945
01:35:16.353 --> 01:35:18.772
You're trying to tell me what to do.

1946
01:35:18.939 --> 01:35:21.358
I'm not but you're way out of line, Nick.

1947
01:35:21.441 --> 01:35:23.401
Where's your head?

1948
01:35:23.526 --> 01:35:25.487
Where's your fucking balls? Huh?

1949
01:35:25.570 --> 01:35:27.906
You know I'm trying to put
something big together here.

1950
01:35:27.989 --> 01:35:30.450
You know what I'm talking about.

1951
01:35:30.575 --> 01:35:32.869
If you're acting like this
now, how can I depend on you?

1952
01:35:32.953 --> 01:35:34.704
A lot of things gonna change.

1953
01:35:34.788 --> 01:35:37.999
If you wanna be there,
you're gonna have to go my fucking way.

1954
01:35:38.083 --> 01:35:41.544
Listen, Nicky,
I'm responsible for thousands of people.

1955
01:35:41.628 --> 01:35:43.672
I got $100 million a year
going through the place.

1956
01:35:43.755 --> 01:35:47.217
It's all over if I don't get that license.

1957
01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:51.388
If it goes bad for me,
it's gonna go bad for a lot of people.

1958
01:35:51.471 --> 01:35:52.806
Forget your license.

1959
01:35:52.889 --> 01:35:56.184
I plant my own flag here and
you ain't gonna need a license.

1960
01:35:57.978 --> 01:36:01.022
I don't Know what it is, Sammy,
but the more I talk to you,

1961
01:36:01.106 --> 01:36:03.858
the more I feel like you don't
want to go along with me.

1962
01:36:03.942 --> 01:36:05.485
No, I don't want to come along with you.

1963
01:36:05.652 --> 01:36:07.237
Okay, fine.

1964
01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:09.948
I don't want to be involved with it.

1965
01:36:10.031 --> 01:36:11.283
I want to run a square joint.

1966
01:36:11.408 --> 01:36:12.659
I just want my license.

1967
01:36:12.742 --> 01:36:14.995
I want everything quiet. That's it.

1968
01:36:15.078 --> 01:36:16.329
Quiet like this? "I'm the boss"?

1969
01:36:16.496 --> 01:36:17.747
That's quiet?

1970
01:36:17.831 --> 01:36:19.499
I had no control over that.

1971
01:36:19.582 --> 01:36:21.334
Ronnie and Billy
will tell you what happened.

1972
01:36:21.418 --> 01:36:23.962
Back home that looks bad.

1973
01:36:24.045 --> 01:36:26.214
Bad? Every time you're on television,

1974
01:36:26.339 --> 01:36:28.550
I get mentioned. That looks bad.

1975
01:36:28.633 --> 01:36:30.635
What the fuck happened to you?

1976
01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:32.762
What happened to you? You lost control.

1977
01:36:32.846 --> 01:36:34.556
I lost control?

1978
01:36:34.681 --> 01:36:36.433
You're walking around like John Barrymore.

1979
01:36:36.516 --> 01:36:38.685
A pink robe and a fucking cigarette holder?

1980
01:36:38.810 --> 01:36:40.979
I lost control?

1981
01:36:41.062 --> 01:36:42.439
I don't wanna bring this up,

1982
01:36:42.522 --> 01:36:46.526
but you been treating people with
disrespect, even your wife.

1983
01:36:46.860 --> 01:36:49.279
What does she have to do with all this?

1984
01:36:49.362 --> 01:36:51.406
She was upset about a lot of things,

1985
01:36:51.489 --> 01:36:54.826
especially that fucking
Lester Diamond incident.

1986
01:36:54.951 --> 01:36:56.703
You're the shoulder to cry on?

1987
01:36:56.828 --> 01:36:58.538
Did you her tell about your role in that?

1988
01:36:58.621 --> 01:37:01.041
No, that's not the fucking point.

1989
01:37:01.124 --> 01:37:04.627
The point is she's upset,
and you've got a fucking problem.

1990
01:37:04.711 --> 01:37:07.964
I would appreciate it if you
stay out of my personal life.

1991
01:37:08.048 --> 01:37:10.216
She came to talk to me.

1992
01:37:10.383 --> 01:37:12.552
What was I supposed to do? Throw her out?

1993
01:37:12.635 --> 01:37:14.471
Stay away. It's none of your business.

1994
01:37:14.596 --> 01:37:16.431
It's none of my business?

1995
01:37:16.514 --> 01:37:18.933
A week ago it was my business, now it's not.

1996
01:37:19.017 --> 01:37:21.686
So when you need me to take care of
things, you need me?

1997
01:37:21.770 --> 01:37:24.981
Yeah, the way you need me to
vouch for you as a citizen.

1998
01:37:25.065 --> 01:37:27.317
I'm gonna have to
straighten out what you did.

1999
01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:29.402
This guy is gonna run to the FBI.

2000
01:37:29.527 --> 01:37:31.529
Your head's bigger than your casino.

2001
01:37:31.946 --> 01:37:34.657
<i>I knew what he wanted and
I didn't want any part of it.</i>

2002
01:37:34.741 --> 01:37:36.451
<i>Nicky wanted to take over.</i>

2003
01:37:36.534 --> 01:37:41.373
<i>He wanted to go after Gaggi, the
skim, everything and everybody.</i>

2004
01:37:41.456 --> 01:37:43.708
<i>Plus, he had stopped asking
permission from back home</i>

2005
01:37:43.792 --> 01:37:45.085
<i>for every little thing.</i>

2006
01:37:49.923 --> 01:37:51.883
<i>A casino boss and his wife were killed.</i>

2007
01:37:52.008 --> 01:37:54.010
<i>The bulls questioned Nicky.</i>

2008
01:37:54.803 --> 01:37:56.388
<i>A dealer from The Sirocco.</i>

2009
01:37:56.513 --> 01:37:58.056
<i>They questioned Nicky.</i>

2010
01:37:58.139 --> 01:38:00.809
<i>Some stool pigeons
wound up in their car trunks.</i>

2011
01:38:00.892 --> 01:38:02.102
<i>They questioned Nicky.</i>

2012
01:38:02.185 --> 01:38:03.436
<i>A lawyer.</i>

2013
01:38:06.231 --> 01:38:07.774
<i>They questioned Nicky.</i>

2014
01:38:07.857 --> 01:38:11.027
<i>When guys who didn't pay,
their shylocks began disappearing,</i>

2015
01:38:11.111 --> 01:38:13.905
<i>Nicky's name was in those newspapers.</i>

2016
01:38:13.988 --> 01:38:17.992
<i>Nicky was questioned in two dozen
murders but they always let him go.</i>

2017
01:38:18.076 --> 01:38:19.369
<i>There were never any witnesses.</i>

2018
01:38:19.452 --> 01:38:23.623
<i>The coppers blamed me for
every fucking thing that went wrong.</i>

2019
01:38:23.706 --> 01:38:24.707
Watch yourself.

2020
01:38:24.833 --> 01:38:25.875
You're gonna get runned over, there.

2021
01:38:25.959 --> 01:38:29.421
<i>If a guy tripped over a banana
peel, they'd bring me in for it.</i>

2022
01:38:29.504 --> 01:38:31.881
Come on, be nice, huh? Be nice.

2023
01:38:31.965 --> 01:38:33.299
<i>The bosses were no better.</i>

2024
01:38:33.383 --> 01:38:36.177
<i>They complained because
things don't run smooth.</i>

2025
01:38:36.261 --> 01:38:39.556
<i>In my line of work,
things don't run so smooth. I'm sorry.</i>

2026
01:38:39.639 --> 01:38:41.891
<i>I'm dealing with
degenerate animals out here.</i>

2027
01:38:41.975 --> 01:38:44.060
<i>But the bosses, what do they give a fuck?</i>

2028

their asses drinking anisette,</i>

<i>Fucking bosses think it's a
fucking free lunch out here.</i>

2031

Frankie, they found
a guy's head in the desert.

2032
01:38:57.574 --> 01:38:59.492
Do you know about that?

2033
01:38:59.576 --> 01:39:01.369
- Yeah, I heard.
- Yeah.

2034
01:39:01.453 --> 01:39:03.413
They're making a big deal out of it.

2035
01:39:03.538 --> 01:39:05.498
It's in all the papers.

2036
01:39:05.582 --> 01:39:07.167
What are you gonna do?

2037
01:39:07.250 --> 01:39:08.501
And I mean, that's no good.

2038
01:39:08.668 --> 01:39:09.919
I know.

2039
01:39:10.003 --> 01:39:13.715
You gotta tell him to take
care of things 2 little batter.

2040
01:39:14.757 --> 01:39:15.967
I'll tell him, Remo.

2041
01:39:16.050 --> 01:39:18.928
<i>Fucking bosses smoking their Di Nobilis</i>

2042
01:39:19.012 --> 01:39:22.098
<i>and eating trip' and fucking
soffrit', fried pigs' guts,</i>

2043
01:39:22.182 --> 01:39:25.435
<i>while if I want to talk private,
I gotta go to a bus stop.</i>

2044
01:39:25.518 --> 01:39:28.688
What do they care,
long as I keep sending money back?

2045
01:39:28.771 --> 01:39:30.023
They're complaining.

2046
01:39:30.106 --> 01:39:31.608
Let them complain. I'm the one who's here.

2047
01:39:31.733 --> 01:39:33.276
I do all the work.

2048
01:39:34.068 --> 01:39:35.695
Somebody don't like it, fuck them.

2049
01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:37.405
It's up to you.

2050
01:39:38.406 --> 01:39:40.533
They want a fucking war? I'm ready.

2051
01:39:40.992 --> 01:39:43.953
All I gotta do is take
care of five of those guys,

2052
01:39:44.037 --> 01:39:46.456
the rest will fall into place. Believe me.

2053
01:39:46.539 --> 01:39:49.083
<i>Peek-a-boo, you fucks, you.</i>

2054
01:39:50.001 --> 01:39:51.711
I see you, you motherfuckers.

2055
01:39:51.794 --> 01:39:55.381
<i>Nicky was not only bringing
heat on himself but on me, too.</i>

2056
01:39:55.465 --> 01:39:57.675
<i>The FBI watched every move he made</i>

2057
01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:00.011
<i>but he didn't care. He just didn't care.</i>

2058
01:40:00.094 --> 01:40:03.097
<i>If you're gonna watch me,
I'm gonna watch them right back.</i>

2059
01:40:03.181 --> 01:40:04.641
I Spent & few DUCKS. Top dollar.

2060
01:40:04.766 --> 01:40:06.226
<i>Who gives a shit?</i>

2061
01:40:06.309 --> 01:40:08.436
<i>I got the latest anti-bugging equipment</i>

2062
01:40:08.561 --> 01:40:10.730
<i>from the same places that sell to the CIA.</i>

2063
01:40:10.813 --> 01:40:13.525
<i>I had special police frequency radios,</i>

2064
01:40:13.608 --> 01:40:16.611
<i>FBI de-scramblers,
cameras that see in the dark.</i>

2065
01:40:16.694 --> 01:40:19.322
<i>And because of that,
the miserable sons of bitches</i>

2066
01:40:19.447 --> 01:40:22.116
<i>never caught me doing anything.</i>

2067
01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:25.495
<i>I got my job on the line and this
guy's having the time of his life.</i>

2068
01:40:25.578 --> 01:40:29.541
<i>He has every cop in the state watching
him and he's out playing golf.</i>

2069
01:40:29.624 --> 01:40:32.335
<i>And at the worst possible time for me.</i>

2070
01:40:33.086 --> 01:40:34.587
<i>I had my license hearing coming up</i>

2071
01:40:34.671 --> 01:40:36.798
<i>and I didn't want to
leave anything to chance.</i>

2072
01:40:38.925 --> 01:40:41.094
<i>If I can't work in Vegas,
where am I gonna go?</i>

2073
01:40:41.177 --> 01:40:42.971
You've been very open with us.

2074
01:40:43.096 --> 01:40:44.889
I mean, your books and papers.

2075
01:40:44.973 --> 01:40:47.141
The Commission will appreciate that.

2076
01:40:47.225 --> 01:40:49.143
All I ask is a fair hearing.

2077
01:40:49.269 --> 01:40:51.229
This kind of honesty will guarantee that.

2078
01:40:51.312 --> 01:40:52.730
Good.

2079
01:40:52.855 --> 01:40:54.274
All right, we'll move on to...

2080
01:40:55.900 --> 01:40:59.445
I wanted to hear
the summary about Kansas City.

2081
01:41:01.155 --> 01:41:02.574
What the fuck is this?

2082
01:41:05.076 --> 01:41:07.620
Where's this guy gonna land? The fairway?

2083
01:41:27.765 --> 01:41:28.975
They're fucking agents, Frankie.

2084
01:41:29.142 --> 01:41:30.393
Look at this.

2085
01:41:32.145 --> 01:41:34.147
<i>The Feds were watching Nicky play golf</i>

2086
01:41:34.272 --> 01:41:36.316
<i>for so long, they ran out of gas.</i>

2087
01:41:37.567 --> 01:41:40.695
<i>Just what I needed,
right in front of the Control Board.</i>

2088
01:41:45.575 --> 01:41:47.702
$100, whoever hits the plane.

2089
01:41:50.538 --> 01:41:52.415
<i>If things weren't bad enough,</i>

2090
01:41:52.498 --> 01:41:54.834
<i>in comes Piscano, the Kansas City underboss.</i>

2091
01:41:55.418 --> 01:41:58.504
<i>He ran that grocery store where
they brought the suitcases.</i>

2092
01:41:58.588 --> 01:42:00.256
Fighting over those suitcases again.

2093
01:42:00.381 --> 01:42:02.050
You know what that means?

2094
01:42:02.133 --> 01:42:05.553
Another trip to Vegas
and another couple of grand.

2095
01:42:05.637 --> 01:42:07.263
<i>He ran it with his brother-in-law,</i>

2096
01:42:07.347 --> 01:42:11.934
<i>but mostly he complained
about his trips to Vegas.</i>

2097
01:42:12.226 --> 01:42:13.561
You gotta lay down the law,

2098
01:42:13.686 --> 01:42:15.021
otherwise they're gonna
make a fool out of you.

2099
01:42:15.104 --> 01:42:17.065
I write it all down.

2100
01:42:17.190 --> 01:42:19.192
Every fucking nickel goes down...

2101
01:42:19.275 --> 01:42:20.943
Hey. Oh, what's the matter with you?

2102
01:42:21.069 --> 01:42:22.779
Everything's here.

2103
01:42:22.862 --> 01:42:24.113
Since when do you talk like that?

2104
01:42:24.238 --> 01:42:25.490
I'm sorry.

2105
01:42:25.573 --> 01:42:29.452
Screw with those suitcases and I'll
take the eyes out of his fricking head.

2106
01:42:29.535 --> 01:42:30.703
Again.

2107
01:42:30.828 --> 01:42:31.954
I didn't curse. I said fricking head.

2108
01:42:32.038 --> 01:42:33.289
- That's enough.
- Sorry.

2109
01:42:33.373 --> 01:42:35.249
<i>What happens next? You can't believe it.</i>

2110
01:42:35.333 --> 01:42:38.586
<i>Who would believe that the
FBI had a wire in the place</i>

2111
01:42:38.670 --> 01:42:41.464
<i>looking for information
about some old homicide</i>

2112
01:42:41.547 --> 01:42:44.801
<i>about some guy who was
whacked out God knows when.</i>

2113
01:42:44.884 --> 01:42:47.428
What's to prevent him taking what he wants?

2114
01:42:47.512 --> 01:42:50.139
Nance brings two suitcases
from the Tangiers.

2115
01:42:50.223 --> 01:42:51.766
What about three or four?

2116
01:42:51.849 --> 01:42:53.226
We've got nobody in the room to watch.

2117
01:42:53.351 --> 01:42:54.686
That's the law.

2118
01:42:54.769 --> 01:42:56.562
We can't even go into the count room

2119
01:42:56.688 --> 01:42:58.481
to watch our money. Cowboy bullshit.

2120
01:42:58.564 --> 01:43:00.316
He's got his people in there,

2121
01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:03.611
but they could all be in on it
together, those fucks.

2122
01:43:03.861 --> 01:43:05.446
I'll find out.

2123
01:43:05.571 --> 01:43:07.156
If it's Green, I'll bury that bastard.

2124
01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:09.826
I never trusted him.

2125
01:43:09.909 --> 01:43:11.828
They trust that scumbag. I don't.

2126
01:43:11.911 --> 01:43:14.497
I'll hit the two of
them with a fucking shovel.

2127
01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:15.707
Take it easy.

2128
01:43:15.790 --> 01:43:17.583
I'm sorry.
They're beating me left and right.

2129
01:43:17.709 --> 01:43:19.460
Ma, I'm sorry. I'm upset.

2130
01:43:19.544 --> 01:43:21.587
I know, but that's enough.

2131
01:43:21.754 --> 01:43:23.798
I can't take this no more. Back and forth.

2132
01:43:23.881 --> 01:43:25.091
Take it easy.

2133
01:43:25.216 --> 01:43:26.384
You'll get a heart attack like that.

2134
01:43:26.467 --> 01:43:28.845
I'm too upset. An end has to be put to this.

2135
01:43:28.928 --> 01:43:32.265
<i>The damn thing is,
they hear all this stuff about Las Vegas</i>

2136
01:43:32.348 --> 01:43:35.184
<i>and the casinos and suitcases and that's it.</i>

2137
01:43:35.268 --> 01:43:36.519
Let's start handling things

2138
01:43:36.602 --> 01:43:39.021
<i>the way I did years ago, start kicking ass.</i>

2139
01:43:39.188 --> 01:43:41.524
<i>And I'll use a goddamn shovel.</i>

2140
01:43:41.607 --> 01:43:43.234
<i>Everything's coming out of my pocket.</i>

2141
01:43:43.359 --> 01:43:45.027
<i>You are right.</i>

2142
01:43:45.111 --> 01:43:47.947
<i>Would you believe it could happen?</i>

2143
01:43:48.906 --> 01:43:50.742
<i>I'm in it to make money, not to lose money.</i>

2144
01:43:50.825 --> 01:43:54.370
<i>Every FBI man across the
country had their ears open now.</i>

2145
01:43:54.454 --> 01:43:57.081
<i>If you want something done
right, gotta do it yourself.</i>

2146
01:43:58.750 --> 01:44:02.837
<i>I mean, Piscano,
this guy basically sunk the whole world.</i>

2147
01:44:03.671 --> 01:44:06.007
<i>Some are good and some are bad.</i>

2148
01:44:06.466 --> 01:44:09.051
Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission,

2149
01:44:09.135 --> 01:44:11.387
Mr. Rothstein is pleased to be here today.

2150
01:44:11.471 --> 01:44:13.973
<i>And when the day finally came, I was ready.</i>

2151
01:44:14.056 --> 01:44:17.935
<i>I felt so confident that all I
had to do was present my case.</i>

2152
01:44:18.019 --> 01:44:20.146
We have documents, one of which

2153
01:44:20.313 --> 01:44:22.440
IS & report by retired FBI agents,

2154
01:44:22.523 --> 01:44:26.235
which completely absolves
Mr. Rothstein from any wrongdoing.

2155
01:44:26.319 --> 01:44:27.862
Counselor...

2156
01:44:27.987 --> 01:44:29.572
I want to have this marked.

2157
01:44:29.655 --> 01:44:31.783
This Commission is prepared to act

2158
01:44:31.908 --> 01:44:34.076
on a motion denying the application.

2159
01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:35.161
Denying?

2160
01:44:35.286 --> 01:44:36.287
Do I hear a motion seconded?

2161
01:44:36.370 --> 01:44:38.122
Mr. Chairman, I second the motion.

2162
01:44:38.247 --> 01:44:39.957
Do I have a vote on the motion?

2163
01:44:40.041 --> 01:44:41.417
Mr. Chairman.

2164
01:44:41.542 --> 01:44:42.919
Aye.

2165
01:44:43.002 --> 01:44:44.504
The ayes have it. This hearing is adjourned.

2166
01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:46.088
You're kidding.

2167
01:44:46.172 --> 01:44:48.257
What do you mean, adjourned?

2168
01:44:48.341 --> 01:44:50.510
Mr. Chairman, Senator,
you promised me a hearing.

2169
01:44:50.593 --> 01:44:53.679
You didn't even look at the FBI reports.

2170
01:44:53.763 --> 01:44:57.475
When you were my guest
at the Tangiers Hotel,

2171
01:44:57.558 --> 01:44:59.685
did you not promise me a fair hearing?

2172
01:44:59.769 --> 01:45:01.020
I was never your guest.

2173
01:45:01.145 --> 01:45:02.396
You were never my guest?

2174
01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:04.565
I don't comp you about three times a month?

2175
01:45:04.649 --> 01:45:07.443
I'd like to answer that.

2176
01:45:07.527 --> 01:45:09.153
Mr. Rothstein is being very typical.

2177
01:45:09.278 --> 01:45:10.947
He's lying.

2178
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:12.949
The only time { was at the Tangiers

2179
01:45:13.074 --> 01:45:14.992
was dinner with Barney Greenstein.

2180
01:45:15.076 --> 01:45:16.369
Was I at that dinner?

2181
01:45:16.494 --> 01:45:17.745
Tell me, was I at that dinner?

2182
01:45:17.829 --> 01:45:20.790
You were wandering.

2183
01:45:20.873 --> 01:45:22.959
You were... You were in the building.

2184
01:45:23.042 --> 01:45:26.796
You know I was at that
dinner and you swore to me

2185
01:45:26.879 --> 01:45:29.799
I would have a fair hearing, did you not?

2186
01:45:29.882 --> 01:45:31.175
Did you not?

2187
01:45:32.552 --> 01:45:34.262
Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner.

2188
01:45:34.387 --> 01:45:36.138
Allow me that much.

2189
01:45:36.556 --> 01:45:37.765
Give me that much at least.

2190
01:45:37.890 --> 01:45:39.141
Yes, you were.

2191
01:45:39.225 --> 01:45:42.144
Thanks for not calling me a
liar, you son of a bitch.

2192
01:45:42.228 --> 01:45:44.146
<i>Good evening.</i>

2193
01:45:44.230 --> 01:45:47.692
<i>A routine licensing hearing
turned into bedlam yesterday</i>

2194
01:45:47.775 --> 01:45:49.569
<i>when the flamboyant
Tangiers casino executive,</i>

2195
01:45:49.694 --> 01:45:51.445
<i>Sam "Ace" Rothstein,</i>

2196
01:45:51.529 --> 01:45:55.324
<i>accused the state's top gaming
officials of corruption.</i>

2197
01:45:55.408 --> 01:45:57.994
...at my hotel and you asked
for copies of your bill

2198
01:45:58.077 --> 01:46:00.371
so you could put them
on your expense account.

2199
01:46:00.454 --> 01:46:04.834
<i>In a wild outburst that followed
his gaming license denial,</i>

2200
01:46:04.917 --> 01:46:08.421
<i>Rothstein followed stunned
commissioners into the hallway</i>

2201
01:46:08.504 --> 01:46:12.633
<i>where he continued his harangue until
his own lawyers urged him to leave.</i>

2202
01:46:12.717 --> 01:46:14.677
You have a past, I have a past

2203
01:46:14.802 --> 01:46:16.762
and my past is no worse than yours,

2204
01:46:16.846 --> 01:46:19.307
but you guys think you have
the right to pass judgment.

2205
01:46:19.390 --> 01:46:22.935
Long suspected of running
the Tangiers without a license,

2206
01:46:23.019 --> 01:46:25.229
<i>yesterday's hearing was to determine</i>

2207
01:46:25.354 --> 01:46:27.523
<i>if someone with Rothstein's history</i>

2208
01:46:27.607 --> 01:46:30.443
<i>was qualified to officially
hold a top gaming post.</i>

2209
01:46:30.526 --> 01:46:31.861
<i>Fucking hypocrites!</i>

2210
01:46:33.279 --> 01:46:34.780
What the hell's he gonna do now?

2211
01:46:34.906 --> 01:46:36.407
I don't know.

2212
01:46:36.866 --> 01:46:38.618
What's he doing?

2213
01:46:38.701 --> 01:46:41.412
He knows all those guys he
yelled at are friends of ours.

2214
01:46:41.495 --> 01:46:43.706
What's the matter with him?

2215
01:46:43.789 --> 01:46:45.875
Maybe he could run things
with another job title.

2216
01:46:45.958 --> 01:46:48.711
Wouldn't be the best but what can we do?

2217
01:46:49.003 --> 01:46:51.130
However he runs things, it's gotta be quiet.

2218
01:46:51.255 --> 01:46:53.382
Let him hide upstairs in the office.

2219
01:46:53.466 --> 01:46:55.676
Say he's a janitor, I don't give a shit.

2220
01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:58.596
BUt, please, whatever job he takes,

2221
01:46:58.721 --> 01:47:01.599
make sure it's something quiet.

2222
01:47:09.982 --> 01:47:13.277
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
The Tangiers Hotel proudly presents</i>

2223
01:47:13.361 --> 01:47:15.655
<i>the all-new Sam Rothstein show,</i>

2224
01:47:15.738 --> 01:47:17.198
Aces High.

2225
01:47:20.660 --> 01:47:23.746
<i>Tonight, taped live
from the all-new sports book,</i>

2226
01:47:23.829 --> 01:47:26.749
<i>we present the premiere
showing of Aces High,</i>

2227
01:47:26.832 --> 01:47:29.293
<i>with the Sasha Semenoff Orchestra,</i>

2228
01:47:30.378 --> 01:47:33.005
<i>and the Sam Rothstein dancers!</i>

2229
01:47:34.882 --> 01:47:37.259
<i>Mr. Rothstein is a professional gambler</i>

2230
01:47:37.343 --> 01:47:39.887
<i>and the best football
handicapper in America.</i>

2231
01:47:39.971 --> 01:47:42.348
<i>A man who will take
you inside the real Las Vegas</i>

2232
01:47:42.473 --> 01:47:44.850
<i>as no one has ever done before.</i>

2233
01:47:45.101 --> 01:47:49.605
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen, the new
entertainment director of the Tangiers Hotel,</i>

2234
01:47:49.689 --> 01:47:51.816
<i>Mr. Sam Rothstein.</i>

2235
01:48:00.700 --> 01:48:02.868
Welcome to the Sam Rothstein Show.

2236
01:48:03.035 --> 01:48:05.162
We're very happy to have you here tonight.

2237
01:48:05.246 --> 01:48:07.164
The young lady to my left is Trudy,

2238
01:48:07.248 --> 01:48:11.293
who is a lead dancer in our
fabulous show from Paris.

2239
01:48:11.377 --> 01:48:13.838
Our first guest this evening

2240
01:48:15.172 --> 01:48:16.841
is Frankie Avalon.

2241
01:48:22.596 --> 01:48:24.390
Keep an eye on him.

2242
01:48:24.598 --> 01:48:25.808
I've got a large family.

2243
01:48:25.933 --> 01:48:27.143
How many kids do you have?

2244
01:48:27.226 --> 01:48:30.563
I'm very proud to say
that we have eight children.

2245
01:48:30.980 --> 01:48:32.273
Eight children.

2246
01:48:32.398 --> 01:48:33.691
No, please. Please.

2247
01:48:33.774 --> 01:48:35.109
That's amazing.

2248
01:48:35.192 --> 01:48:37.403
There's nothing to it. It was my pleasure.

2249
01:48:38.988 --> 01:48:40.614
Ace, don't do it.

2250
01:48:40.990 --> 01:48:43.409
Oh, no, no. Oh, no.

2251
01:48:44.618 --> 01:48:46.412
Oh, Jesus.

2252
01:48:47.038 --> 01:48:48.664
He's juggling!

2253
01:48:48.914 --> 01:48:52.668
<i>Let's not take County
Commissioner Pat Webb too seriously.</i>

2254
01:48:52.835 --> 01:48:54.628
I recently challenged him to a debate

2255
01:48:54.754 --> 01:48:56.589
on this program and he declined.

2256
01:48:56.672 --> 01:48:58.841
What are you worried about, Pat?

2257
01:48:58.966 --> 01:49:01.135
You don't have to send me any questions.

2258
01:49:01.761 --> 01:49:03.888
You can ask me anything you want.

2259
01:49:03.971 --> 01:49:06.807
What the hell is he doing on television?

2260
01:49:06.891 --> 01:49:09.435
He's on all night screaming about how

2261
01:49:09.602 --> 01:49:12.146
he's gonna take this to the Supreme Court.

2262
01:49:12.229 --> 01:49:13.981
He's crazy.

2263
01:49:14.106 --> 01:49:15.858
He's going to Washington with this?

2264
01:49:15.941 --> 01:49:17.860
He's out of his fucking mind.

2265
01:49:17.943 --> 01:49:20.362
It's a pity we have such hypocrisy.

2266
01:49:20.446 --> 01:49:22.448
Some people do what they want,

2267
01:49:22.573 --> 01:49:24.533
other people have to pay through the nose.

2268
01:49:24.617 --> 01:49:27.203
Andy, go see him.

2269
01:49:28.079 --> 01:49:30.664
Tell him maybe it's time he should quit.

2270
01:49:35.961 --> 01:49:38.798
What they did was totally unconstitutional.

2271
01:49:38.881 --> 01:49:41.884
We're on the list to be heard
before the Supreme Court.

2272
01:49:41.967 --> 01:49:44.970
They don't give a fuck
about the Supreme Court.

2273
01:49:45.054 --> 01:49:47.598
They want you to walk away.

2274
01:49:47.681 --> 01:49:49.141
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious.

2275
01:49:49.266 --> 01:49:50.726
How can I walk away?

2276
01:49:50.810 --> 01:49:53.062
Don't you see what's at stake?

2277
01:49:53.145 --> 01:49:56.023
The old man said maybe
your friend should give in.

2278
01:49:56.107 --> 01:49:58.943
When the old man says "maybe,"
it's like a papal bull.

2279
01:49:59.026 --> 01:50:01.195
Not only should you quit, you should run.

2280
01:50:01.278 --> 01:50:03.864
The problem is every time
they mention my name,

2281
01:50:03.989 --> 01:50:06.575
they mention Nicky, too.

2282
01:50:06.659 --> 01:50:08.494
How the fuck does that help?

2283
01:50:08.994 --> 01:50:11.205
The heat he brought down is murder.

2284
01:50:11.330 --> 01:50:13.249
The police department was cooperative

2285
01:50:13.332 --> 01:50:14.792
but he's pissed them off so much now

2286
01:50:14.917 --> 01:50:17.294
that nobody can make a move anymore.

2287
01:50:17.378 --> 01:50:18.504
What are you proposing?

2288
01:50:18.587 --> 01:50:19.922
I don't know. He doesn't listen to me.

2289
01:50:20.005 --> 01:50:23.634
Maybe he should get lost for a while.

2290
01:50:23.717 --> 01:50:25.094
They ain't sending Nicky nowhere.

2291
01:50:25.177 --> 01:50:28.514
It'd give everybody time to maneuver.

2292
01:50:28.597 --> 01:50:30.599
I would forget about the maneuver.

2293
01:50:30.724 --> 01:50:32.726
I would just get out.

2294
01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:37.982
I can't do that.

2295
01:50:38.941 --> 01:50:43.279
<i>Of course, as soon as Andy got
home, Nicky heard about our talk.</i>

2296
01:50:43.362 --> 01:50:46.365
<i>Next morning, bright and
early, I get the call.</i>

2297
01:50:47.074 --> 01:50:48.284
I've got to do some shopping.

2298
01:50:48.409 --> 01:50:49.618
You want to go?

2299
01:50:49.702 --> 01:50:52.288
<i>But just getting a call
from Nicky wasn't easy.</i>

2300
01:50:52.371 --> 01:50:53.706
<i>Even the codes didn't work.</i>

2301
01:50:53.831 --> 01:50:55.166
<i>So we figured out another act.</i>

2302
01:50:55.249 --> 01:50:56.584
<i>If a phone's tapped,</i>

2303
01:50:56.667 --> 01:50:59.712
<i>the Feds can only listen in
on stuff involving crimes.</i>

2304
01:50:59.795 --> 01:51:03.174
<i>So on routine calls,
they have to click off after a few minutes.</i>

2305
01:51:03.549 --> 01:51:05.843
<i>Yeah, I got a sprained fucking elbow.</i>

2306
01:51:06.552 --> 01:51:07.887
- Yeah.
- Meet me at 3:00.

2307
01:51:07.970 --> 01:51:09.221
Caesar's?

2308
01:51:09.346 --> 01:51:10.598
100 yards down the road.

2309
01:51:11.265 --> 01:51:13.642
- Why?
- Don't ask questions.

2310
01:51:15.936 --> 01:51:18.856
Suzy Cream Cheese has the exact same outfit.

2311
01:51:20.441 --> 01:51:24.111
I saw something, something very cute.

2312
01:51:25.112 --> 01:51:28.574
Okay, he's out. It's the brown unit.

2313
01:51:28.908 --> 01:51:31.827
And he's with a bogey. I think it's Frankie.

2314
01:51:31.911 --> 01:51:33.996
<i>Nicky started out before me</i>

2315
01:51:34.079 --> 01:51:36.373
<i>because it wasn't easy for him
to get around.</i>

2316
01:51:36.457 --> 01:51:38.417
Pulled out fast.

2317
01:51:38.834 --> 01:51:42.338
<i>Nicky couldn't go for a ride
without changing cars at least six times</i>

2318
01:51:42.421 --> 01:51:44.131
<i>before he could shake all his tails.</i>

2319
01:51:44.215 --> 01:51:47.885
<i>And because of the planes,
he had to use underground garages.</i>

2320
01:52:18.958 --> 01:52:21.669
<i>Meeting in the middle of the
desert always made me nervous.</i>

2321
01:52:21.752 --> 01:52:23.879
<i>It's a scary place.</i>

2322
01:52:24.296 --> 01:52:26.131
<i>I knew about the holes in the desert</i>

2323
01:52:26.215 --> 01:52:29.260
and everywhere <i>I</i> looked,
there <i>could</i> have been a hole.

2324
01:52:31.929 --> 01:52:34.223
<i>Normally, my prospects of coming back alive</i>

2325
01:52:34.306 --> 01:52:37.309
<i>from a meeting with
Nicky were 99 out of 100.</i>

2326
01:52:38.852 --> 01:52:40.896
<i>But this time, when I heard him say,</i>

2327
01:52:41.021 --> 01:52:43.107
<i>"A couple of hundred yards down the road,"</i>

2328
01:52:43.565 --> 01:52:45.401
<i>I gave myself 50-50.</i>

2329
01:53:06.714 --> 01:53:10.843
Where the fuck you get off talking
to people about me behind my back?

2330
01:53:10.926 --> 01:53:12.177
What people?

2331
01:53:12.344 --> 01:53:13.595
You think I wasn't gonna find out?

2332
01:53:13.679 --> 01:53:15.764
What are you talking about?

2333
01:53:15.848 --> 01:53:18.392
You said I'm bringing heat on you.

2334
01:53:18.475 --> 01:53:21.020
I gotta listen to people
because of your shit?

2335
01:53:21.103 --> 01:53:22.563
You're ordering me out?

2336
01:53:22.688 --> 01:53:24.148
You better get your own fucking army.

2337
01:53:24.231 --> 01:53:26.275
I didn't order anybody.

2338
01:53:26.358 --> 01:53:28.944
I told Andy Stone that you had
heat and that was a problem.

2339
01:53:29.028 --> 01:53:31.739
You want me to get out
of my own fucking town?

2340
01:53:31.822 --> 01:53:34.658
Let the bullshit blow over
so I can run the casino.

2341
01:53:34.742 --> 01:53:37.703
Anything goes wrong with the
casino, it's my ass. It's not yours.

2342
01:53:37.786 --> 01:53:39.580
I don't know whether you know

2343
01:53:39.663 --> 01:53:43.125
but you only have your
fucking casino because of me.

2344
01:53:43.208 --> 01:53:44.752
I'm what counts out here.

2345
01:53:44.835 --> 01:53:48.922
Not your fucking country clubs
or your fucking TV shows.

2346
01:53:49.006 --> 01:53:51.592
And what the fuck
are you doing on TV anyhow?

2347
01:53:51.675 --> 01:53:53.594
I get calls from home every day.

2348
01:53:53.719 --> 01:53:55.637
They think you went batshit.

2349
01:53:55.721 --> 01:53:58.474
I'm only on TV because I gotta be
able to hang around the casino.

2350
01:53:58.557 --> 01:53:59.808
Come on.

2351
01:53:59.892 --> 01:54:02.978
You could have had the food and
beverage job without going on TV!

2352
01:54:03.062 --> 01:54:04.229
You wanted to go on TV.

2353
01:54:04.396 --> 01:54:05.522
Yeah, I did.

2354
01:54:05.606 --> 01:54:08.609
That way I have a forum. I can fight back.

2355
01:54:08.692 --> 01:54:10.194
They know they can't fuck around with me

2356
01:54:10.319 --> 01:54:11.820
like they could if I was an unknown.

2357
01:54:11.904 --> 01:54:13.655
You're making a spectacle of yourself.

2358
01:54:13.739 --> 01:54:17.993
Me? I wouldn't even be in this
situation if it wasn't for you.

2359
01:54:18.077 --> 01:54:21.163
Every time I meet somebody,
the question is do I know you?

2360
01:54:21.246 --> 01:54:22.748
Now you wanna blame your license on me?

2361
01:54:22.873 --> 01:54:24.333
No, Nicky.

2362
01:54:24.416 --> 01:54:26.919
When you asked me
if you could come out here,

2363
01:54:27.002 --> 01:54:31.048
what did I tell you? Do you remember?

2364
01:54:31.131 --> 01:54:33.675
Back up a fucking minute.

2365
01:54:33.759 --> 01:54:34.927
I asked you?

2366
01:54:35.010 --> 01:54:38.097
When the fuck did I ever ask
you if I could come out here?

2367
01:54:38.222 --> 01:54:39.348
You never...

2368
01:54:39.473 --> 01:54:40.641
Get this through your head,

2369
01:54:40.724 --> 01:54:42.559
you Jew motherfucker, you.

2370
01:54:42.643 --> 01:54:44.603
You only exist out here because of me.

2371
01:54:44.770 --> 01:54:46.688
That's the only reason.

2372
01:54:46.772 --> 01:54:49.316
Without me, you personally,

2373
01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:51.777
every fucking wise guy still around

2374
01:54:51.944 --> 01:54:54.321
will take a piece of your fucking Jew ass.

2375
01:54:54.405 --> 01:54:55.656
Then where you gonna go?

2376
01:54:55.781 --> 01:54:57.074
You're fucking warned.

2377
01:54:57.157 --> 01:55:00.869
Don't go over my head again,
you motherfucker, you.

2378
01:55:25.978 --> 01:55:28.105
<i>Crack that whip</i>

2379
01:55:28.814 --> 01:55:30.607
<i>Give the past the slip</i>

2380
01:55:30.691 --> 01:55:32.818
We got company.

2381
01:55:38.907 --> 01:55:41.118
<i>When a problem comes along</i>

2382
01:55:41.201 --> 01:55:43.745
<i>You must whip it Before
the cream sits out too long</i>

2383
01:55:43.829 --> 01:55:45.497
<i>You must whip it</i>

2384
01:55:45.581 --> 01:55:48.250
You see that? Dumb Jew motherfucker.

2385
01:55:48.333 --> 01:55:52.421
Grew up together and he's acting
like he don't even know me.

2386
01:55:52.504 --> 01:55:54.339
I know we're supposed to avoid each other,

2387
01:55:54.506 --> 01:55:56.341
but there's ways to do things.

2388
01:55:56.425 --> 01:55:57.634
Fuck him.

2389
01:55:57.718 --> 01:55:58.886
To Abraham Lincoln.

2390
01:55:59.011 --> 01:56:00.179
To him.

2391
01:56:00.262 --> 01:56:02.306
Don't let it bother you.

2392
01:56:02.431 --> 01:56:04.433
Does it look like it's bothering me?

2393
01:56:04.516 --> 01:56:06.727
Why do I give a fuck?

2394
01:56:06.810 --> 01:56:08.270
Fucking Oscar, too.

2395
01:56:08.395 --> 01:56:09.855
All the fucking money I give him. Prick.

2396
01:56:09.938 --> 01:56:11.857
He won't even look over.
What's his fucking problem?

2397
01:56:13.150 --> 01:56:15.194
Fucking Jews stick together.

2398
01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:17.446
They're having a good time, too.

2399
01:56:17.946 --> 01:56:19.281
So are we.

2400
01:56:25.537 --> 01:56:27.539
- Yeah?
- Sam, we got a problem.

2401
01:56:27.748 --> 01:56:29.249
- <i>What is it?</i>
- The little guy.

2402
01:56:29.416 --> 01:56:32.586
<i>Nobody told him he was
eighty-sixed from the joint</i>

2403
01:56:32.669 --> 01:56:35.797
so we turned our heads and made
out we didn't know who he was.

2404
01:56:35.881 --> 01:56:40.135
He's over at the 21 table
with his nose wide open.

2405
01:56:40.219 --> 01:56:41.970
<i>He took money out of his own kick.</i>

2406
01:56:42.095 --> 01:56:43.847
<i>His nose is open for about $10,000.</i>

2407
01:56:43.931 --> 01:56:45.224
<i>Now he's really pissed.</i>

2408
01:56:45.390 --> 01:56:46.683
Oh, no.

2409
01:56:47.017 --> 01:56:48.227
He wants a $50,000 marker.

2410
01:56:49.102 --> 01:56:50.896
Just give him $10,000. That's it.

2411
01:56:50.979 --> 01:56:52.022
I'll be right down.

2412
01:56:52.147 --> 01:56:53.273
He'll come up with $10,000.

2413
01:56:53.357 --> 01:56:54.900
$10,000? No, no, no.

2414
01:56:54.983 --> 01:56:57.528
$50,000. I said fucking $50,000!

2415
01:56:57.611 --> 01:56:59.988
Go get it. I don't give a fuck where.

2416
01:57:00.072 --> 01:57:03.492
Fuckers. They take it but
they don't wanna give it back.

2417
01:57:06.954 --> 01:57:09.039
How the fuck can you grin?

2418
01:57:09.164 --> 01:57:11.208
How the fuck can you grin?

2419
01:57:11.291 --> 01:57:13.377
You know how much I'm stuck?

2420
01:57:13.502 --> 01:57:15.587
You give a fuck? Do you?

2421
01:57:18.507 --> 01:57:22.010
Yeah. Give yourself a hand,
right across your fucking mouth.

2422
01:57:22.094 --> 01:57:24.346
Look at this fucking beaut they put in now.

2423
01:57:24.429 --> 01:57:26.348
Sherbert send you to rob me now?

2424
01:57:26.431 --> 01:57:28.559
Been fucking knocking
everybody's dick all night?

2425
01:57:28.642 --> 01:57:30.894
Been beating the customers?

2426
01:57:30.978 --> 01:57:33.647
Huh, jag-off? Hit me.

2427
01:57:36.441 --> 01:57:40.028
Take this stiff and pound
it up your fucking ass.

2428
01:57:40.112 --> 01:57:41.947
Hit me again.

2429
01:57:46.076 --> 01:57:49.079
Take this one and stick
it up your sister's ass.

2430
01:57:49.162 --> 01:57:50.539
Hit me again.

2431
01:57:50.622 --> 01:57:52.499
That's it. Keep looking at him.

2432
01:57:52.583 --> 01:57:55.711
If you had any heart at all,
you'd be stealing for a living.

2433
01:57:55.794 --> 01:58:00.215
Hit me again! What the fuck you keep
looking at him for? You fucking...

2434
01:58:00.299 --> 01:58:01.633
Look at this, 20 fucking paints in a row.

2435
01:58:01.758 --> 01:58:03.135
Hit me again.

2436
01:58:08.015 --> 01:58:09.683
He's here.

2437
01:58:09.808 --> 01:58:11.476
You should pay as fast as you collect.

2438
01:58:14.771 --> 01:58:16.315
You gotta get out of here.

2439
01:58:16.398 --> 01:58:19.151
Tell this Jew motherfucker
to pay that marker off.

2440
01:58:19.234 --> 01:58:20.694
I'm here to help you.

2441
01:58:20.819 --> 01:58:22.321
You're gonna bury us both.

2442
01:58:22.404 --> 01:58:23.947
Just give me the money.

2443
01:58:24.072 --> 01:58:25.574
Give me the fucking money, Sammy.

2444
01:58:25.657 --> 01:58:27.618
I'm gonna okay you $10,000.

2445
01:58:27.701 --> 01:58:30.078
Then you gotta get out before
the cops are all over you.

2446
01:58:30.162 --> 01:58:32.080
$10,000 and that's it.

2447
01:58:37.002 --> 01:58:40.339
What are you staring at,
you bald-headed Jew prick?

2448
01:58:44.676 --> 01:58:46.637
Come on. Let's get out of here.

2449
01:58:46.762 --> 01:58:48.722
I'm still gonna get you, fucker.

2450
01:58:48.805 --> 01:58:50.474
Get out of here?

2451
01:58:50.599 --> 01:58:52.267
I got a marker coming. Deal.

2452
01:58:52.351 --> 01:58:53.685
Everything's changed.

2453
01:58:53.852 --> 01:58:55.187
You're talking about divorce.

2454
01:58:55.270 --> 01:58:57.189
You're asking for alimony payments,

2455
01:58:57.314 --> 01:58:59.191
child support, and now custody.

2456
01:58:59.274 --> 01:59:01.443
I want what any divorced woman would get.

2457
01:59:01.526 --> 01:59:03.695
She's only sober about two hours a day.

2458
01:59:03.779 --> 01:59:06.156
From 11:00 a.m. till 1:00 in the afternoon.

2459
01:59:06.239 --> 01:59:08.617
If I gave her her money and her jewels,

2460
01:59:08.742 --> 01:59:11.119
she's gonna piss it away in a year.

2461
01:59:11.203 --> 01:59:12.996
Where would you be then?

2462
01:59:13.121 --> 01:59:14.915
Coming right back to me. Right back to me.

2463
01:59:14.998 --> 01:59:17.834
Or finding some other excuse to come...

2464
01:59:18.168 --> 01:59:21.129
We had a deal. Remember that?

2465
01:59:22.214 --> 01:59:24.383
He said if it didn't work out between us,

2466
01:59:24.508 --> 01:59:26.718
I could get my things and leave.

2467
01:59:28.303 --> 01:59:29.888
Look in my eyes.

2468
01:59:30.263 --> 01:59:31.890
Look in my eyes.

2469
01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:34.810
You know me.

2470
01:59:34.893 --> 01:59:37.354
Do you see anything that makes you think

2471
01:59:37.437 --> 01:59:41.441
I would ever let someone in your
condition take my child away from me?

2472
01:59:43.735 --> 01:59:44.986
Do you?

2473
01:59:47.114 --> 01:59:49.074
You know that won't happen.

2474
01:59:53.954 --> 01:59:55.831
<i>And after all this time,</i>

2475
01:59:55.914 --> 01:59:59.334
<i>and as hard as I tried, as much as I wanted,</i>

2476
01:59:59.418 --> 02:00:01.253
<i>I could never reach her.</i>

2477
02:00:01.336 --> 02:00:03.255
<i>I could never make her love me.</i>

2478
02:00:03.338 --> 02:00:05.966
<i>I always felt she should have gone for it,</i>

2479
02:00:06.049 --> 02:00:07.592
<i>all that money, being somebody</i>

2480
02:00:07.718 --> 02:00:09.219
<i>for the first time in her life,</i>

2481
02:00:09.302 --> 02:00:11.430
<i>a home, a kid.</i>

2482
02:00:11.513 --> 02:00:12.764
<i>That's not what happened.</i>

2483
02:00:12.889 --> 02:00:14.099
<i>It didn't work out.</i>

2484
02:00:14.182 --> 02:00:15.183
Everything all right?

2485
02:00:15.308 --> 02:00:16.309
<i>What could we do?</i>

2486
02:00:16.393 --> 02:00:18.270
<i>After a while,
we'd take breathers from each other.</i>

2487
02:00:18.395 --> 02:00:20.230
<i>Little separations.</i>

2488
02:00:20.313 --> 02:00:22.941
<i>At that time, I remember Ginger took Amy</i>

2489
02:00:23.066 --> 02:00:25.652
<i>to Beverly Hills to spend a week shopping.</i>

2490
02:00:25.736 --> 02:00:27.446
<i>Yes, Mr. Rothstein?</i>

2491
02:00:27.571 --> 02:00:29.239
The Beverly Hotel in Beverly Hills.

2492
02:00:29.322 --> 02:00:30.782
<i>Beverly Hotel.</i>

2493
02:00:30.907 --> 02:00:32.367
<i>Mrs. Rothstein, please.</i>

2494
02:00:32.451 --> 02:00:35.871
<i>Sorry, Mr. and Mrs.
Rothstein have checked out already.</i>

2495
02:00:35.954 --> 02:00:38.665
Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?

2496
02:00:38.749 --> 02:00:40.625
Hey, little Dale Evans.

2497
02:00:40.709 --> 02:00:42.419
<i>Yes, they both checked out.</i>

2498
02:00:42.544 --> 02:00:44.254
Thank you.

2499
02:00:50.260 --> 02:00:51.803
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Yeah.

2500
02:00:51.887 --> 02:00:54.765
My wife is with
an old friend of hers in L.A.

2501
02:00:54.848 --> 02:00:57.476
<i>Some lowlife. A guy named Lester Diamond.</i>

2502
02:00:57.559 --> 02:00:58.977
My daughter is with them.

2503
02:00:59.102 --> 02:01:00.479
I think they're gonna kidnap her.

2504
02:01:00.562 --> 02:01:02.230
Is there anybody you can send?

2505
02:01:02.314 --> 02:01:04.483
We'll take care of it.

2506
02:01:09.488 --> 02:01:10.947
We got a number and an address.

2507
02:01:11.072 --> 02:01:12.491
Hello?

2508
02:01:12.574 --> 02:01:13.617
<i>Hello.</i>

2509
02:01:13.742 --> 02:01:14.785
Is this Lester?

2510
02:01:16.036 --> 02:01:17.120
Who's calling?

2511
02:01:17.245 --> 02:01:18.330
This is Sam Rothstein.

2512
02:01:18.413 --> 02:01:19.831
I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on.

2513
02:01:19.998 --> 02:01:21.416
She's not here, Sam.

2514
02:01:21.500 --> 02:01:23.210
Lester, listen to me very carefully.

2515
02:01:23.335 --> 02:01:25.086
I want to talk to Ginger.

2516
02:01:25.170 --> 02:01:27.005
I want my kid back.

2517
02:01:27.172 --> 02:01:29.007
I want her put on a plane immediately.

2518
02:01:29.090 --> 02:01:30.842
<i>I know she's there. Don't fuck around.</i>

2519
02:01:30.967 --> 02:01:32.677
Sam, I wouldn't.

2520
02:01:32.761 --> 02:01:34.930
You shouldn't do this.

2521
02:01:35.013 --> 02:01:37.182
<i>Understand? Put her on the fucking phone.</i>

2522
02:01:37.349 --> 02:01:39.559
Sam, I don't know where she is, okay?

2523
02:01:40.185 --> 02:01:41.812
So, listen.

2524
02:01:41.937 --> 02:01:43.522
Can I call you back in & few minutes?

2525
02:01:44.356 --> 02:01:47.108
<i>702-472-1862.</i>

2526
02:01:47.192 --> 02:01:48.527
1862. I'll call you right back.

2527
02:01:48.652 --> 02:01:49.945
<i>Right away.</i>

2528
02:01:50.028 --> 02:01:51.738
- Right back.
- You got it.

2529
02:01:51.822 --> 02:01:55.867
Schmuck.
All right, I just bought us a few minutes.

2530
02:01:56.368 --> 02:01:58.870
You want to get back at this prick?

2531
02:01:59.204 --> 02:02:02.040
Okay, you got what, $2 million in that box?

2532
02:02:02.123 --> 02:02:03.834
Hey, you got a minute? Hey.

2533
02:02:03.959 --> 02:02:05.669
He's got $2 million in the box, am I right?

2534
02:02:05.752 --> 02:02:07.420
Okay, you let him keep your jewels.

2535
02:02:07.504 --> 02:02:09.673
We take the cash and the only
other thing he cares about.

2536
02:02:09.756 --> 02:02:11.049
Her majesty.

2537
02:02:11.132 --> 02:02:13.718
We go to Europe. You dye your hair.

2538
02:02:13.802 --> 02:02:15.428
I don't want to go to Europe.

2539
02:02:15.554 --> 02:02:17.180
I want to go to see The Elephant Man.

2540
02:02:17.264 --> 02:02:20.600
We're going to Europe. Let the adults talk.

2541
02:02:20.684 --> 02:02:22.269
You dye your hair.

2542
02:02:22.394 --> 02:02:24.020
You get plastic surgery like
we talked about.

2543
02:02:24.104 --> 02:02:26.189
How much will he pay to get this kid back...

2544
02:02:26.273 --> 02:02:29.442
- I don't want to go to Europe.
- Shut your mouth.

2545
02:02:29.609 --> 02:02:30.735
You shut up.

2546
02:02:30.819 --> 02:02:32.153
You want me to come and smack your face?

2547
02:02:32.237 --> 02:02:33.738
Don't give me your shit!

2548
02:02:34.364 --> 02:02:36.992
This has always been a dream,
but now we're going.

2549
02:02:37.075 --> 02:02:38.785
Lester, he called you here.

2550
02:02:38.910 --> 02:02:40.620
Right. That's who was on the phone.

2551
02:02:40.704 --> 02:02:41.705
I talked to him.

2552
02:02:41.830 --> 02:02:42.831
He knows where you are.

2553
02:02:42.914 --> 02:02:45.292
That means he's sending
some guys over right now.

2554
02:02:45.375 --> 02:02:47.168
It means he's sitting by the phone,

2555
02:02:47.294 --> 02:02:49.087
like a dumbbell, waiting for me to call.

2556
02:02:49.170 --> 02:02:52.257
He's sitting by the phone
just waiting for you to call.

2557
02:02:52.340 --> 02:02:53.758
What are we gonna do?

2558
02:02:53.842 --> 02:02:56.219
He's probably got guys
outside the fucking house!

2559
02:02:56.344 --> 02:02:58.430
This is fucking bullshit!

2560
02:02:58.555 --> 02:03:00.640
Get your bag! Let's go!

2561
02:03:00.724 --> 02:03:02.601
What bullshit? You want to talk it over?

2562
02:03:02.726 --> 02:03:04.603
Okay, you done yakking?

2563
02:03:04.686 --> 02:03:07.022
Go, go! Get in the car! Go!

2564
02:03:07.105 --> 02:03:09.107
Just relax. Nobody's killing anybody.

2565
02:03:09.274 --> 02:03:11.276
<i>I think he's gonna kill me.</i>

2566
02:03:11.359 --> 02:03:13.570
Call me back here in exactly an hour

2567
02:03:13.695 --> 02:03:15.906
on this phone. I'll see what I can do.

2568
02:03:15.989 --> 02:03:19.409
I'm gonna call you back in an
hour and you're gonna be there?

2569
02:03:19.492 --> 02:03:20.660
I'll be here.

2570
02:03:20.744 --> 02:03:25.040
Listen, don't do anything else crazy.
You all right? Okay.

2571
02:03:25.123 --> 02:03:26.416
Bye.

2572
02:03:26.958 --> 02:03:27.918
Knock it off.

2573
02:03:28.043 --> 02:03:30.420
She started it. I'm just standing here.

2574
02:03:30.545 --> 02:03:31.880
You're not gonna drive.

2575
02:03:31.963 --> 02:03:34.382
I'm not gonna drive with some crazy woman.

2576
02:03:34.466 --> 02:03:35.634
You're driving me nuts!

2577
02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:37.010
Get on the passenger side!

2578
02:03:37.093 --> 02:03:39.888
I'm sending this kid
to Bolivia in & fucking box!

2579
02:03:56.738 --> 02:03:57.906
Gin...

2580
02:04:05.497 --> 02:04:09.292
<i>You can go your own way</i>

2581
02:04:09.376 --> 02:04:11.920
<i>Go your own way</i>

2582
02:04:12.003 --> 02:04:14.422
<i>Tell me why</i>

2583
02:04:14.506 --> 02:04:16.216
<i>Everything turned...</i>

2584
02:04:16.299 --> 02:04:17.926
Ginger called me.

2585
02:04:21.137 --> 02:04:22.389
Yeah?

2586
02:04:23.223 --> 02:04:24.766
I just told you she called me.

2587
02:04:24.891 --> 02:04:26.434
What'd she want?

2588
02:04:28.186 --> 02:04:30.271
She was afraid to call you.

2589
02:04:30.522 --> 02:04:32.107
She's with that cocksucker again.

2590
02:04:32.232 --> 02:04:33.817
They got Amy-

2591
02:04:33.900 --> 02:04:37.362
She wants to come back but she's
afraid you're gonna whack her out.

2592
02:04:37.445 --> 02:04:38.738
They're gonna kidnap my kid.

2593
02:04:38.863 --> 02:04:40.156
What do you want?

2594
02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:42.659
I know. Why didn't you come to me?

2595
02:04:42.742 --> 02:04:45.161
I mean, this is family. It ain't business.

2596
02:04:45.245 --> 02:04:48.081
You make calls back home.
It makes us look bad out here.

2597
02:04:48.164 --> 02:04:49.457
You know what I mean?

2598
02:04:49.541 --> 02:04:51.710
Back and forth, this one and that one.

2599
02:04:51.793 --> 02:04:53.169
In the meantime, she's gone anyway.

2600
02:04:53.294 --> 02:04:54.671
Am I right?

2601
02:04:56.214 --> 02:04:58.883
What am I going to do with this woman?

2602
02:04:59.592 --> 02:05:01.928
She's driving me fucking crazy.

2603
02:05:02.012 --> 02:05:06.016
I think if you assure her
that she's gonna be all right,

2604
02:05:06.099 --> 02:05:07.434
she'll come back.

2605
02:05:08.977 --> 02:05:10.770
Driving me fucking crazy.

2606
02:05:10.854 --> 02:05:12.689
Once you get her here, you think about it.

2607
02:05:12.814 --> 02:05:14.649
Wait till you get the kid back.

2608
02:05:14.733 --> 02:05:16.234
She wants to come back.

2609
02:05:16.401 --> 02:05:17.944
That's the main thing here.

2610
02:05:18.528 --> 02:05:21.573
You want your kid, don't you? Huh?

2611
02:05:25.243 --> 02:05:26.494
<i>Hello.</i>

2612
02:05:26.786 --> 02:05:28.955
Hi, it's me.

2613
02:05:29.080 --> 02:05:31.249
Just who you wanted to talk to, right?

2614
02:05:31.332 --> 02:05:34.127
Listen, I'm not gonna ask you where you are.

2615
02:05:34.210 --> 02:05:36.254
Just, please, put Amy on a plane,

2616
02:05:36.421 --> 02:05:38.506
any plane, to get her here right away.

2617
02:05:38.590 --> 02:05:41.384
<i>- Please. That's all I'm asking.</i>
- Do you...

2618
02:05:41.634 --> 02:05:44.262
I mean, I don't think
she should go by herself.

2619
02:05:46.765 --> 02:05:48.308
What do you mean?

2620
02:05:48.433 --> 02:05:50.018
What I mean is...

2621
02:05:50.101 --> 02:05:52.103
Do you think if...

2622
02:05:52.270 --> 02:05:54.314
Do you think if I came back...

2623
02:05:55.774 --> 02:05:57.942
Do you think you could forgive me?

2624
02:05:59.110 --> 02:06:01.821
I don't know. I gotta
tell you, I don't know.

2625
02:06:01.905 --> 02:06:03.948
I understand that.

2626
02:06:05.116 --> 02:06:06.868
I know I fucked up.

2627
02:06:07.660 --> 02:06:09.788
What about the money? Where's the box?

2628
02:06:09.871 --> 02:06:14.876
I gotta tell you, I made some
mistakes, and I spent some money.

2629
02:06:14.959 --> 02:06:16.586
What's it under?

2630
02:06:16.711 --> 02:06:18.379
<i>Pretty serious.</i>

2631
02:06:18.463 --> 02:06:20.507
<i>How serious?</i>

2632
02:06:20.632 --> 02:06:22.717
It's under $25,000.

2633
02:06:22.801 --> 02:06:24.761
- <i>It's under $25,000?</i>
- Yeah.?

2634
02:06:24.886 --> 02:06:26.554
The rest of the $2 million is still there?

2635
02:06:26.638 --> 02:06:28.389
Yeah. I got the rest.

2636
02:06:28.473 --> 02:06:30.809
Okay, no big deal. That's okay.

2637
02:06:31.434 --> 02:06:33.144
He got his $25,000.

2638
02:06:33.728 --> 02:06:35.355
That I'll live with. Any more, I couldn't.

2639
02:06:35.480 --> 02:06:37.107
Okay.

2640
02:06:37.190 --> 02:06:38.983
All right. All right. Where are you?

2641
02:06:39.150 --> 02:06:40.944
I'll send a plane right away.

2642
02:06:44.531 --> 02:06:46.074
Hi, Sam.

2643
02:06:57.627 --> 02:06:58.837
So what'd you do with it?

2644
02:06:58.962 --> 02:07:00.171
With what?

2645
02:07:00.255 --> 02:07:01.506
You...

2646
02:07:02.674 --> 02:07:04.217
With the money.

2647
02:07:05.510 --> 02:07:07.387
He needed some clothes.

2648
02:07:08.388 --> 02:07:10.473
$25,000 on clothes?

2649
02:07:12.267 --> 02:07:14.185
He wanted a watch, too.

2650
02:07:16.896 --> 02:07:19.357
$25,000 for clothes and a watch?

2651
02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:20.441
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

2652
02:07:21.568 --> 02:07:23.153
Good evening, signora. This way.

2653
02:07:23.278 --> 02:07:24.821
Gino.

2654
02:07:24.904 --> 02:07:27.115
<i>The good part was I had Amy back.</i>

2655
02:07:27.198 --> 02:07:29.367
<i>So we went home,
had the housekeeper stay over,</i>

2656
02:07:29.492 --> 02:07:31.619
<i>put the kid to bed,</i>

2657
02:07:31.703 --> 02:07:34.455
<i>I calmed myself down and we went to dinner.</i>

2658
02:07:34.539 --> 02:07:38.209
<i>I tried to keep things nice and
civil, you know, but, hey,</i>

2659
02:07:38.626 --> 02:07:40.753
<i>$25,000 for three suits?</i>

2660
02:07:41.504 --> 02:07:43.381
<i>That doesn't make much sense.</i>

2661
02:07:43.464 --> 02:07:46.176
First of all,
he's not gonna wear $1,000 suits.

2662
02:07:47.635 --> 02:07:49.637
Let's say he did, which he won't,

2663
02:07:49.721 --> 02:07:52.849
how you gonna get fitted
for 25 suits in three days?

2664
02:07:55.185 --> 02:07:57.020
How could you get fitted that fast?

2665
02:07:57.145 --> 02:07:59.022
I can't and I pay twice as much.

2666
02:07:59.898 --> 02:08:01.065
I bought him a watch, too.

2667
02:08:01.191 --> 02:08:02.400
Yeah.

2668
02:08:03.318 --> 02:08:05.153
But even if you bought
him a really nice watch,

2669
02:08:05.278 --> 02:08:07.155
one he thought was nice...

2670
02:08:07.238 --> 02:08:09.407
He doesn't know what the
fuck a good watch is.

2671
02:08:09.490 --> 02:08:10.575
Say you go 10,12 grand...

2672
02:08:10.700 --> 02:08:11.784
Yeah.

2673
02:08:11.868 --> 02:08:14.704
At the most, which is impossible, for him.

2674
02:08:15.538 --> 02:08:17.540
Plus, at the most, three suits,

2675
02:08:17.665 --> 02:08:19.709
$1,000 apiece, that still leaves what?

2676
02:08:20.585 --> 02:08:22.045
Around $10,000?

2677
02:08:22.170 --> 02:08:23.671
Would you knock it off, Sam?

2678
02:08:23.755 --> 02:08:25.465
I'm just trying to figure it out.

2679
02:08:25.590 --> 02:08:27.342
There's nothing to figure out.

2680
02:08:29.177 --> 02:08:31.930
I'm home. We're working it out.

2681
02:08:32.472 --> 02:08:35.183
But I've been told before,
"We're working it out."

2682
02:08:35.266 --> 02:08:37.352
You think that you're home,

2683
02:08:37.435 --> 02:08:41.272
after what you just put me through with
Amy, as a favor to me?

2684
02:08:48.655 --> 02:08:52.116
So, counting the watch,
let's say another $4,000

2685
02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:54.452
for expenses over the weekend,

2686
02:08:54.911 --> 02:08:56.871
of which you must have had a good time.

2687
02:08:56.955 --> 02:08:59.457
I know he did, that's for sure.

2688
02:08:59.707 --> 02:09:02.377
I know that fucking piece of
shit had a good fucking time.

2689
02:09:04.462 --> 02:09:05.838
On my money.

2690
02:09:06.172 --> 02:09:07.966
You might as well have fucked him,

2691
02:09:08.132 --> 02:09:09.926
which you probably did anyway.

2692
02:09:11.010 --> 02:09:13.179
You're looking at me a certain way.

2693
02:09:14.472 --> 02:09:16.641
You're teary-eyed, huh?

2694
02:09:17.225 --> 02:09:18.810
You're upset.

2695
02:09:18.935 --> 02:09:20.478
You're a good actress, you know that?

2696
02:09:20.561 --> 02:09:22.563
Good fucking actress.

2697
02:09:23.773 --> 02:09:25.650
You can fucking get that pity out of people.

2698
02:09:25.817 --> 02:09:27.735
I'm not a john. You understand?

2699
02:09:27.819 --> 02:09:29.487
You always thought I was, but I'm not.

2700
02:09:29.612 --> 02:09:31.281
And I'm not a sucker.

2701
02:09:32.573 --> 02:09:35.201
That fucking pimp cocksucker.

2702
02:09:35.285 --> 02:09:37.287
He's lucky I didn't kill him last time.

2703
02:09:37.370 --> 02:09:39.122
Lucky he's fucking living.

2704
02:09:39.205 --> 02:09:40.581
If you'd stayed with Amy,

2705
02:09:40.665 --> 02:09:42.750
and you'd have ran away,
he would have been fucking dead.

2706
02:09:42.834 --> 02:09:45.586
Both of you. Dead. Dead.

2707
02:09:51.175 --> 02:09:53.511
I can't fucking live like this.

2708
02:09:54.846 --> 02:09:57.098
No, it isn't right. It isn't fair.

2709
02:09:57.181 --> 02:09:59.267
What do you...

2710
02:09:59.350 --> 02:10:01.352
Of course. Yes.

2711
02:10:02.854 --> 02:10:04.564
He doesn't come home at night.

2712
02:10:04.689 --> 02:10:06.441
What is the big fucking deal? I go...

2713
02:10:06.524 --> 02:10:08.443
I just can't fucking take it.

2714
02:10:08.526 --> 02:10:10.194
Why should I fucking take it?

2715
02:10:10.361 --> 02:10:11.988
That wasn't the deal.

2716
02:10:12.071 --> 02:10:15.658
He acts like I'm the only one
around here with a fucking past.

2717
02:10:15.742 --> 02:10:17.785
He'll never let me live it down.

2718
02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:19.954
Well, yes, I have tried.

2719
02:10:20.038 --> 02:10:21.456
Of course I've tried.

2720
02:10:21.539 --> 02:10:23.416
What the fuck do you think
I came back here for?

2721
02:10:24.042 --> 02:10:26.586
No, I'm not. I want to have him killed.

2722
02:10:26.919 --> 02:10:29.464
Yes, I want him killed. I've fucking had it.

2723
02:10:29.547 --> 02:10:31.674
So are you with me on this?

2724
02:10:32.884 --> 02:10:35.511
You want to get rid of me? Here I am.

2725
02:10:35.928 --> 02:10:37.889
Go ahead. Get rid of me.

2726
02:10:38.514 --> 02:10:40.016
Hello?

2727
02:10:40.141 --> 02:10:41.642
Yes, I do!

2728
02:10:41.726 --> 02:10:46.356
I fucking hate you! I can't take it anymore!

2729
02:10:46.439 --> 02:10:47.732
Yes, I want to kill you!

2730
02:10:47.899 --> 02:10:49.192
I hate your fucking guts!

2731
02:10:49.275 --> 02:10:50.735
You hate my guts?

2732
02:10:50.818 --> 02:10:51.861
I'm sick of being with you!

2733
02:10:51.986 --> 02:10:53.821
I want you to come with me now!

2734
02:10:54.697 --> 02:10:56.657
Come with me now.

2735
02:10:56.741 --> 02:10:58.576
I want you out. I want you out of here.

2736
02:10:58.701 --> 02:11:00.495
I want you out of here!

2737
02:11:00.578 --> 02:11:01.662
No!

2738
02:11:01.788 --> 02:11:02.914
I want you out of here!

2739
02:11:04.999 --> 02:11:06.834
Take your fucking bag and get out!

2740
02:11:06.959 --> 02:11:08.795
I want my money right now!

2741
02:11:08.878 --> 02:11:10.421
You'll get your money, don't worry.

2742
02:11:10.588 --> 02:11:12.131
The arrangement is over.

2743
02:11:12.215 --> 02:11:13.424
No kidding!

2744
02:11:13.591 --> 02:11:14.801
And I still get my money.

2745
02:11:14.884 --> 02:11:16.427
I need some cash now!

2746
02:11:16.552 --> 02:11:18.096
You can't just put me in the street!

2747
02:11:18.179 --> 02:11:19.806
You haven't been straight
with me since we met!

2748
02:11:19.931 --> 02:11:21.557
You never loved me!

2749
02:11:21.641 --> 02:11:24.769
I need eyes in the back of my
fucking head with you, bitch!

2750
02:11:24.852 --> 02:11:26.938
How could I love you?

2751
02:11:27.105 --> 02:11:29.190
You treat me like I'm your fucking dog!

2752
02:11:29.273 --> 02:11:30.650
You're lower than a dog!

2753
02:11:30.775 --> 02:11:32.193
Fuck you!

2754
02:11:32.276 --> 02:11:34.737
Here! Here! Is this enough money?

2755
02:11:34.821 --> 02:11:37.365
Will it last you two fucking days? Take it!

2756
02:11:37.448 --> 02:11:39.659
Greedy bitch. Take the fucking money.

2757
02:11:39.742 --> 02:11:42.036
I'm going to the bank
and getting my jewelry!

2758
02:11:42.120 --> 02:11:44.038
Good. It opens at 9:00 a.m. Be there.

2759
02:11:44.122 --> 02:11:47.208
Don't send your guys down
there to stop me! I mean it!

2760
02:11:47.291 --> 02:11:49.377
I guarantee you, I will not stop you.

2761
02:11:49.460 --> 02:11:51.170
You don't get rid of me with one suitcase!

2762
02:11:51.295 --> 02:11:53.047
Come back tomorrow for the rest.

2763
02:11:53.131 --> 02:11:55.216
- Get out of here.
- Fine!

2764
02:11:55.550 --> 02:11:57.343
- I'm taking Amy.
- You're not.

2765
02:11:57.427 --> 02:11:58.845
I'm waking her up right now.

2766
02:11:58.970 --> 02:12:00.430
You're a junkie. Get out.

2767
02:12:00.513 --> 02:12:02.598
She's my daughter too!

2768
02:12:02.682 --> 02:12:05.893
Send my lawyers a letter,
God fucking damn you!

2769
02:12:06.477 --> 02:12:08.479
You're not getting away with this!

2770
02:12:08.604 --> 02:12:10.565
You're not gonna cut me out of my end!

2771
02:12:11.691 --> 02:12:12.900
Fucked

2772
02:13:05.578 --> 02:13:09.290
<i>The funny thing was, after all
that, I didn't want her to go.</i>

2773
02:13:09.373 --> 02:13:12.043
<i>She was the mother of my kid. I loved her.</i>

2774
02:13:12.126 --> 02:13:15.046
<i>And later, I realized I didn't
want to give her the money</i>

2775
02:13:15.129 --> 02:13:17.381
<i>because if I did,</i>

2776
02:13:17.715 --> 02:13:19.926
<i>I knew I'd never see her again.</i>

2777
02:13:30.228 --> 02:13:31.395
Oh.

2778
02:13:32.021 --> 02:13:34.148
- Have a good day at school, okay?
- Okay.

2779
02:13:34.232 --> 02:13:35.650
Okay, angel.

2780
02:13:40.446 --> 02:13:44.450
From now on, I have to know where
you and Amy are at all times.

2781
02:13:46.452 --> 02:13:48.412
Here's a beeper.

2782
02:13:48.579 --> 02:13:50.748
I want you to keep it on you.

2783
02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:52.667
It's very light.

2784
02:13:52.750 --> 02:13:55.044
So I can call you whenever I have to.

2785
02:13:58.965 --> 02:14:00.091
Okay?

2786
02:14:10.017 --> 02:14:11.978
What are you supposed to do?

2787
02:14:12.061 --> 02:14:13.437
You want to stay the way you are?

2788
02:14:13.604 --> 02:14:14.981
You can't do that.

2789
02:14:15.064 --> 02:14:18.526
Two people don't get along,
at some point you gotta call it.

2790
02:14:18.609 --> 02:14:20.820
It's not my business,
but that's what you gotta do.

2791
02:14:20.903 --> 02:14:22.905
You're right. I know.

2792
02:14:23.781 --> 02:14:25.324
I was just...

2793
02:14:25.449 --> 02:14:27.034
What? What?

2794
02:14:27.159 --> 02:14:29.120
- Nothing.
- What were you gonna say?

2795
02:14:29.203 --> 02:14:30.246
I don't...

2796
02:14:30.371 --> 02:14:31.414
Tell me what you were gonna say.

2797
02:14:31.497 --> 02:14:33.124
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

2798
02:14:33.624 --> 02:14:37.211
I was thinking maybe
you know somebody at the bank

2799
02:14:37.295 --> 02:14:39.672
who could help me get my jewelry out.

2800
02:14:40.172 --> 02:14:42.383
There's a lot of money in there.

2801
02:14:42.466 --> 02:14:45.636
I'd be willing to take care
of anybody who helped me out.

2802
02:14:47.305 --> 02:14:48.472
Let me think about that.

2803
02:14:48.598 --> 02:14:49.724
Okay.

2804
02:14:49.807 --> 02:14:51.475
Let me see who I got.

2805
02:14:51.642 --> 02:14:53.311
Gotta get somebody I can trust, you know?

2806
02:14:53.394 --> 02:14:56.647
Yeah, 'cause you know he's
never gonna give me my jewelry.

2807
02:14:57.607 --> 02:15:00.526
He holds that key so tight,
it's probably up his ass.

2808
02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:04.572
You're right. That's Sammy.

2809
02:15:04.822 --> 02:15:07.366
And he's probably got it there, too.

2810
02:15:08.826 --> 02:15:10.620
He's so fucking lucky.

2811
02:15:10.745 --> 02:15:12.496
I could have buried him.

2812
02:15:12.580 --> 02:15:15.708
I could have gone to Europe
and taken the baby.

2813
02:15:16.626 --> 02:15:19.920
Then he'd have tracked me
down and he'd have killed me.

2814
02:15:20.004 --> 02:15:22.298
No, he wouldn't. I would have.

2815
02:15:22.882 --> 02:15:25.259
- He'd have been right.
- Seriously. Come on.

2816
02:15:25.343 --> 02:15:28.054
You don't take a guy's kid
and then take off.

2817
02:15:28.137 --> 02:15:29.597
I didn't.

2818
02:15:29.680 --> 02:15:32.767
I did, but then I did exactly what
you told me to do, and came back.

2819
02:15:32.850 --> 02:15:36.020
You did. You're right. You did. I like that.

2820
02:15:36.687 --> 02:15:38.064
That's what I like about you.

2821
02:15:38.189 --> 02:15:39.607
You did the right thing.

2822
02:15:39.690 --> 02:15:41.817
- I did what you told me.
- Yes, you did.

2823
02:15:41.901 --> 02:15:43.361
You always tell me the right thing to do.

2824
02:15:43.486 --> 02:15:44.945
Yeah.

2825
02:15:50.826 --> 02:15:53.829
He really fucked himself up out
here, didn't he?

2826
02:15:53.913 --> 02:15:55.373
He sure did.

2827
02:15:55.498 --> 02:15:56.916
Everything went to his head.

2828
02:15:59.418 --> 02:16:00.544
- Changed.
- Changed.

2829
02:16:00.628 --> 02:16:02.088
He did. He ain't the same person.

2830
02:16:02.213 --> 02:16:03.714
No, he's not.

2831
02:16:05.007 --> 02:16:06.467
He really thinks who the fuck he is.

2832
02:16:06.592 --> 02:16:08.052
Exactly.

2833
02:16:11.806 --> 02:16:15.393
He hates me. He hates my fucking guts.

2834
02:16:15.476 --> 02:16:16.894
Come on. You're a toughie.

2835
02:16:17.019 --> 02:16:18.437
You can take this.

2836
02:16:23.067 --> 02:16:24.360
Don't cry.

2837
02:16:24.485 --> 02:16:25.778
I'm not as tough as you think I am.

2838
02:16:26.237 --> 02:16:27.738
Yes, you are.

2839
02:16:28.322 --> 02:16:30.241
He scares the shit out of me.

2840
02:16:30.366 --> 02:16:32.243
I never know what he's gonna do.

2841
02:16:32.326 --> 02:16:33.703
Come on.

2842
02:16:34.078 --> 02:16:35.746
Don't be scared.

2843
02:16:35.913 --> 02:16:37.581
I need some help. I do.

2844
02:16:39.041 --> 02:16:40.751
I need some help.

2845
02:16:42.253 --> 02:16:43.963
You gotta help me.

2846
02:16:44.672 --> 02:16:46.882
I need a new sponsor, Nicky.

2847
02:16:47.925 --> 02:16:49.719
I do. I need a new sponsor.

2848
02:16:49.802 --> 02:16:50.803
Is that what you want?

2849
02:16:50.928 --> 02:16:51.929
Yeah.

2850
02:16:52.012 --> 02:16:53.681
- A sponsor?
- Yeah.

2851
02:16:55.558 --> 02:16:56.642
Okay.

2852
02:16:58.269 --> 02:16:59.812
Don't worry about it.

2853
02:16:59.937 --> 02:17:01.480
Nobody will fuck with you anymore.

2854
02:17:01.605 --> 02:17:04.233
- I'll take care of you.
- Yes, I will. Take care of me.

2855
02:17:04.316 --> 02:17:05.609
It's what you want, isn't it?

2856
02:17:05.776 --> 02:17:07.027
Thank you. Yeah.

2857
02:17:07.111 --> 02:17:08.821
It's what you want?

2858
02:17:29.508 --> 02:17:31.385
You see that? That's Ace's wife.

2859
02:17:32.511 --> 02:17:33.721
<i>Why you fool</i>

2860
02:17:33.804 --> 02:17:36.140
<i>You poor, sad, worthless, foolish fool</i>

2861
02:17:36.223 --> 02:17:37.975
Fantastic.

2862
02:17:39.351 --> 02:17:41.562
<i>...for the hard years I have suffered</i>

2863
02:17:41.645 --> 02:17:43.481
<i>Till things broke your way</i>

2864
02:17:43.564 --> 02:17:45.357
This is great for the boss.

2865
02:17:46.859 --> 02:17:48.819
<i>...that says we must part</i>

2866
02:17:48.903 --> 02:17:52.740
<i>I am tearing it to pieces
the way you tore up my heart</i>

2867
02:17:52.823 --> 02:17:56.702
<i>I smile when you kiss me
and I thrill at your touch</i>

2868
02:17:56.786 --> 02:18:00.247
<i>My only sin was I loved you</i>

2869
02:18:00.331 --> 02:18:02.416
<i>Much too much</i>

2870
02:18:15.095 --> 02:18:16.180
Hi.

2871
02:18:16.347 --> 02:18:17.431
Hi.

2872
02:18:19.934 --> 02:18:21.519
You didn't answer your beeper.

2873
02:18:21.644 --> 02:18:23.187
I threw it away.

2874
02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:24.730
You threw it away?

2875
02:18:24.855 --> 02:18:26.315
Look, I tried to do it.

2876
02:18:26.398 --> 02:18:28.484
I know you want me to, but...

2877
02:18:28.609 --> 02:18:30.694
Driving down the freeway,
the fucking thing's beep, beep!

2878
02:18:30.778 --> 02:18:32.655
I'm in a restaurant, it's embarrassing.

2879
02:18:32.780 --> 02:18:34.657
I don't want to do it anymore.

2880
02:18:35.199 --> 02:18:36.575
Where's Amy?

2881
02:18:37.493 --> 02:18:38.828
I put her to bed.

2882
02:18:38.953 --> 02:18:40.329
Oh. I got your cigarettes.

2883
02:18:43.541 --> 02:18:45.668
Oscar wants you to call him.

2884
02:18:47.336 --> 02:18:48.546
So who'd you go to lunch with?

2885
02:18:48.712 --> 02:18:49.922
With Jennifer.

2886
02:18:50.005 --> 02:18:51.090
Where'd you go?

2887
02:18:51.215 --> 02:18:52.341
To the Riviera.

2888
02:18:54.218 --> 02:18:55.845
What'd you have?

2889
02:18:57.054 --> 02:18:58.347
I had a salad.

2890
02:18:58.472 --> 02:18:59.765
What did Jennifer have?

2891
02:19:01.475 --> 02:19:03.102
She had the same.

2892
02:19:04.311 --> 02:19:05.396
Okay.

2893
02:19:07.398 --> 02:19:08.858
I want you to call Jennifer,

2894
02:19:08.941 --> 02:19:12.069
and I want you to tell her to
tell you what you had for lunch.

2895
02:19:12.152 --> 02:19:14.655
And I'm gonna listen in on the other line.

2896
02:19:15.281 --> 02:19:16.824
Why do you want to do that?

2897
02:19:16.949 --> 02:19:18.492
You know why I want to do it.

2898
02:19:18.576 --> 02:19:19.827
Just do it.

2899
02:19:19.952 --> 02:19:21.245
Fine.

2900
02:19:21.579 --> 02:19:24.206
I just need to get the bowl for my thing.

2901
02:19:32.590 --> 02:19:35.217
The line's busy. There's nobody there.

2902
02:19:42.808 --> 02:19:45.019
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Hello, Jennifer. It's Sam.

2903
02:19:48.188 --> 02:19:51.233
All right. I didn't
have lunch with Jennifer.

2904
02:19:58.490 --> 02:20:00.159
Who were you with?

2905
02:20:01.118 --> 02:20:02.912
I was with somebody.

2906
02:20:03.454 --> 02:20:04.788
I know you were with somebody.

2907
02:20:04.955 --> 02:20:06.290
Who was it?

2908
02:20:14.340 --> 02:20:17.509
I just hope it's not someone
who I think it might be.

2909
02:20:20.137 --> 02:20:22.389
I just hope it's not that.

2910
02:20:25.643 --> 02:20:27.478
<i>I knew she fucked around.</i>

2911
02:20:27.561 --> 02:20:29.897
<i>She did what she did,
I did what I had to do.</i>

2912
02:20:29.980 --> 02:20:34.443
<i>But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst
thing she could have done.</i>

2913
02:20:35.527 --> 02:20:37.237
What if he won't stop?

2914
02:20:37.321 --> 02:20:39.448
<i>it could get us both killed.</i>

2915
02:20:39.823 --> 02:20:41.617
I can back him off.

2916
02:20:45.496 --> 02:20:48.457
<i>She was very convincing
when she wanted to be.</i>

2917
02:20:48.540 --> 02:20:50.793
<i>This is how she backed him off.</i>

2918
02:20:58.133 --> 02:20:59.677
Hey, Ginger,

2919
02:21:00.344 --> 02:21:02.471
don't forget, if you're challenged,

2920
02:21:02.554 --> 02:21:05.057
if he asks anything, deny everything.

2921
02:21:05.140 --> 02:21:06.684
You understand?

2922
02:21:06.809 --> 02:21:08.352
I don't want him bringing beefs back home.

2923
02:21:08.435 --> 02:21:11.522
'Cause that could really
cause a serious problem.

2924
02:21:11.605 --> 02:21:12.648
Got to be careful.

2925
02:21:12.773 --> 02:21:13.774
He's not dumb, you know?

2926
02:21:13.857 --> 02:21:15.526
You hear what I'm saying?

2927
02:21:15.609 --> 02:21:17.361
I know. You don't have to tell me that.

2928
02:21:17.528 --> 02:21:19.321
Do you think I'm stupid?

2929
02:21:20.906 --> 02:21:23.033
Do I think you're stupid? No.

2930
02:21:23.117 --> 02:21:26.537
I think you're beautiful. But I gotta go.

2931
02:21:28.872 --> 02:21:31.750
<i>Nicky now had things
so fucked up on the streets</i>

2932
02:21:31.834 --> 02:21:34.086
<i>that every time Marino went back home,</i>

2933
02:21:34.211 --> 02:21:36.505
<i>the packages got smaller and smaller.</i>

2934
02:21:38.841 --> 02:21:40.968
<i>When he walked into the place,</i>

2935
02:21:41.051 --> 02:21:43.804
<i>he didn't know whether he was
going to be kissed or killed.</i>

2936
02:21:43.887 --> 02:21:46.348
Frankie, I want to ask you something.

2937
02:21:47.057 --> 02:21:48.892
It's private.

2938
02:21:49.018 --> 02:21:50.811
But I want you to tell me the truth.

2939
02:21:51.562 --> 02:21:53.313
Of course, Remo.

2940
02:21:53.397 --> 02:21:56.233
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.

2941
02:21:57.401 --> 02:21:59.361
I always tell you the truth, Remo.

2942
02:22:00.529 --> 02:22:02.823
Frankie, the little guy,

2943
02:22:02.948 --> 02:22:05.242
he wouldn't be fucking
the Jew's wife, would he?

2944
02:22:05.325 --> 02:22:08.746
Because if he is, it's a problem.

2945
02:22:11.540 --> 02:22:12.958
<i>What could I say?</i>

2946
02:22:13.042 --> 02:22:14.835
<i>I knew if I gave the wrong answer,</i>

2947
02:22:14.918 --> 02:22:19.256
<i>Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of them
could have wound up getting killed.</i>

2948
02:22:19.339 --> 02:22:21.967
<i>There's one thing about these old-timers.</i>

2949
02:22:22.051 --> 02:22:25.220
<i>They don't like any fucking
around with the other guys' wives.</i>

2950
02:22:25.304 --> 02:22:26.805
<i>It's bad for business.</i>

2951
02:22:26.889 --> 02:22:28.348
<i>So I lied,</i>

2952
02:22:28.432 --> 02:22:30.476
<i>even though I knew that by lying to Gaggi,</i>

2953
02:22:30.601 --> 02:22:32.728
<i>I could wind up getting killed, too.</i>

2954
02:22:33.395 --> 02:22:35.439
No, I ain't seen anything like that.

2955
02:22:35.606 --> 02:22:37.649
Are you sure?

2956
02:22:38.692 --> 02:22:40.152
I'm positive.

2957
02:22:40.736 --> 02:22:44.782
Remo, things are very fucked
up down there, you know.

2958
02:22:44.865 --> 02:22:46.700
I know. That's why I'm asking.

2959
02:22:46.784 --> 02:22:49.828
You see, my main concern is Nicky.

2960
02:22:49.912 --> 02:22:53.707
I want to know if he's doing all
right, if he's okay.

2961
02:22:53.791 --> 02:22:55.709
He's good. He's fine.

2962
02:22:55.793 --> 02:22:59.254
I'm asking you, Frankie,
to keep an eye on Nicky.

2963
02:22:59.338 --> 02:23:00.464
Do it for me.

2964
02:23:00.589 --> 02:23:01.673
No problem.

2965
02:23:01.757 --> 02:23:04.301
I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything

2966
02:23:04.468 --> 02:23:07.012
for people who are our friends.

2967
02:23:07.513 --> 02:23:09.598
- Understand?
- I understand.

2968
02:23:09.681 --> 02:23:10.808
Okay.

2969
02:23:11.934 --> 02:23:13.352
Frankie, you're a good boy.

2970
02:23:13.477 --> 02:23:14.937
Thanks, Remo.

2971
02:23:15.395 --> 02:23:18.357
<i>By now, Nicky and his crew
had already hit rock bottom.</i>

2972
02:23:18.440 --> 02:23:21.068
<i>Vegas really got to him.</i>

2973
02:23:21.151 --> 02:23:23.821
<i>The booze, the coke, the broads.</i>

2974
02:23:24.947 --> 02:23:26.824
<i>I mean, he got sloppy.</i>

2975
02:23:27.407 --> 02:23:29.284
<i>He just wasn't the same Nicky anymore.</i>

2976
02:23:29.368 --> 02:23:30.536
You must have drank too much.

2977
02:23:30.661 --> 02:23:31.870
Go fuck yourself.

2978
02:23:31.954 --> 02:23:33.914
<i>One night he had to belt a guy three</i>

2979
02:23:34.039 --> 02:23:36.041
<i>times before the guy finally went down.</i>

2980
02:23:36.125 --> 02:23:39.044
<i>In the old days,
Nicky would have decked him with one shot.</i>

2981
02:23:39.128 --> 02:23:41.338
<i>You add this into the mix...</i>

2982
02:23:41.880 --> 02:23:43.966
<i>Maybe just Vegas got to all of us.</i>

2983
02:23:44.049 --> 02:23:46.760
<i>His crew followed him right over the edge.</i>

2984
02:23:46.844 --> 02:23:49.388
<i>They were all tuned up
half the time on coke.</i>

2985
02:23:49.471 --> 02:23:50.973
<i>They started doing stupid things.</i>

2986
02:23:51.098 --> 02:23:52.599
<i>The worst was Blue.</i>

2987
02:23:52.683 --> 02:23:54.017
What do you guys want?

2988
02:23:54.143 --> 02:23:55.435
Police! Stay in the car!

2989
02:23:55.519 --> 02:23:57.896
<i>He never knew when to keep his mouth shut.</i>

2990
02:23:57.980 --> 02:23:59.022
Drop the gun!

2991
02:23:59.189 --> 02:24:00.232
FUCK you!

2992
02:24:05.154 --> 02:24:06.405
<i>The cops shot him.</i>

2993
02:24:06.488 --> 02:24:09.533
<i>They shot Blue because they thought
his hero sandwich was a gun.</i>

2994
02:24:10.951 --> 02:24:12.828
<i>They could have been right but who knows?</i>

2995
02:24:12.911 --> 02:24:14.872
Christ. What gun?

2996
02:24:14.997 --> 02:24:16.915
He's got a fucking hero sandwich.

2997
02:24:16.999 --> 02:24:18.917
What do you want? It's pitch black.

2998
02:24:19.042 --> 02:24:20.961
It's tinfoil. It looked like a gun!

2999
02:24:21.044 --> 02:24:24.631
You fucking moron! I'll be filling
out paperwork for the next two months!

3000
02:24:24.715 --> 02:24:26.466
- I'm sorry!
- You jerk-off!

3001
02:24:26.550 --> 02:24:30.012
<i>To get even,
Nicky's crew got stoned one night</i>

3002
02:24:30.095 --> 02:24:33.223
<i>and they started shooting up
the cops' houses.</i>

3003
02:24:44.026 --> 02:24:47.029
<i>They couldn't talk in The Gold Rush anymore</i>

3004
02:24:47.112 --> 02:24:48.822
<i>because the Feds put a wire in the wall.</i>

3005
02:24:48.906 --> 02:24:52.034
<i>When they talked outside,
they had to cover their mouths...</i>

3006
02:24:52.117 --> 02:24:53.202
He's covering up.

3007
02:24:53.285 --> 02:24:55.120
<i>...because the Feds brought in lip readers.</i>

3008
02:24:55.204 --> 02:24:58.332
<i>Nicky found out from a teller
who owed him money.</i>

3009
02:24:58.415 --> 02:25:01.210
He asked me again
about you and the Jew's wife.

3010
02:25:01.293 --> 02:25:03.754
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?

3011
02:25:04.254 --> 02:25:07.090
He asked me again about
you and the Jew's wife.

3012
02:25:07.174 --> 02:25:08.926
Yeah? What'd you tell him?

3013
02:25:09.593 --> 02:25:11.428
I told him I didn't know nothing.

3014
02:25:11.511 --> 02:25:15.599
Jiggs and Tony Gorilla said if you did
anything, you're fucked up.

3015
02:25:16.058 --> 02:25:19.519
You think he's going home
making a beef behind my back?

3016
02:25:19.603 --> 02:25:21.855
Nah, you would have heard something.

3017
02:25:23.106 --> 02:25:24.441
What's to stop him?

3018
02:25:24.608 --> 02:25:25.943
I know, I know.

3019
02:25:27.945 --> 02:25:29.696
I don't trust him anymore,

3020
02:25:29.821 --> 02:25:31.615
but they'd never okay anything, you know?

3021
02:25:31.698 --> 02:25:34.284
Yeah, but they keep asking about it.

3022
02:25:34.576 --> 02:25:36.078
Sure they're asking.

3023
02:25:36.203 --> 02:25:37.704
They earn with the prick.

3024
02:25:38.747 --> 02:25:39.998
I got a funny feeling

3025
02:25:40.082 --> 02:25:42.042
he's gonna start a fucking war or something.

3026
02:25:43.877 --> 02:25:46.964
I'm not sure yet,
but you know what I want you to do?

3027
02:25:47.047 --> 02:25:49.174
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?

3028
02:25:50.008 --> 02:25:51.385
That ain't nobody.

3029
02:25:51.468 --> 02:25:53.887
You know what I want you to do?

3030
02:25:53.971 --> 02:25:56.306
Get a couple of guys
to dig a hole in the desert,

3031
02:25:56.390 --> 02:25:58.725
then let them show you where it's at.

3032
02:25:58.809 --> 02:26:00.269
Angelo and Buster.

3033
02:26:00.394 --> 02:26:01.853
I'm not sure yet.

3034
02:26:01.937 --> 02:26:03.355
They'll do it.

3035
02:26:03.438 --> 02:26:05.983
When I'm ready, I'll say the word.

3036
02:26:06.149 --> 02:26:08.694
Go see the Jew, and you make it disappear.

3037
02:26:08.777 --> 02:26:10.654
Just let me know. But you gotta be ready.

3038
02:26:10.821 --> 02:26:12.698
You know what I'm saying?

3039
02:26:13.824 --> 02:26:16.118
Did I say to do anything?
I said I'm not sure.

3040
02:26:16.243 --> 02:26:18.495
I'll let you know. I want to think about it.

3041
02:26:18.578 --> 02:26:20.122
Where these pricks at?

3042
02:26:20.247 --> 02:26:21.790
Dominick said they're in the motel?

3043
02:26:21.873 --> 02:26:23.375
There or in the fucking bank. I don't know.

3044
02:26:23.500 --> 02:26:25.002
All over the joint.

3045
02:26:30.882 --> 02:26:33.093
<i>I can't get no</i>

3046
02:26:33.176 --> 02:26:35.387
<i>Satisfaction</i>

3047
02:26:35.470 --> 02:26:37.889
<i>I can't get me no...</i>

3048
02:26:40.434 --> 02:26:42.519
<i>And I try and I try</i>

3049
02:26:44.896 --> 02:26:47.232
<i>I can't get no</i>

3050
02:26:47.316 --> 02:26:49.359
<i>I can't get me no...</i>

3051
02:26:50.068 --> 02:26:53.196
Be right back. I'll be right back.

3052
02:26:53.905 --> 02:26:55.407
Rudy. Any calls, give them to Mr. Sherbert.

3053
02:26:55.532 --> 02:26:57.075
I'll be right back.

3054
02:26:57.159 --> 02:26:58.618
Sure, Mr. Rothstein.

3055
02:26:58.744 --> 02:27:00.203
I'm going home for a few seconds.

3056
02:27:08.920 --> 02:27:10.756
He's on his way home.

3057
02:27:12.382 --> 02:27:13.675
Oh, yeah?

3058
02:27:20.891 --> 02:27:22.059
Hello?

3059
02:27:23.060 --> 02:27:24.269
Hello?

3060
02:27:25.270 --> 02:27:26.355
Ginger?

3061
02:27:26.438 --> 02:27:28.190
Help, Daddy!

3062
02:27:28.273 --> 02:27:30.067
Amy? Amy, open the door!

3063
02:27:30.233 --> 02:27:32.027
I can't! I'm tied!

3064
02:27:36.907 --> 02:27:38.700
- Dad!
- What happened?

3065
02:27:38.909 --> 02:27:40.869
- Who did this to you?
- Mommy.

3066
02:27:41.411 --> 02:27:43.205
I'll get a knife and cut you loose, honey.

3067
02:27:43.330 --> 02:27:45.123
No, please, please.

3068
02:27:45.207 --> 02:27:47.042
Okay, Papa'll be right back.

3069
02:27:47.250 --> 02:27:48.502
When did this happen, honey?

3070
02:27:48.627 --> 02:27:49.878
I don't know.

3071
02:27:49.961 --> 02:27:51.380
What time did your mother do this?

3072
02:27:51.505 --> 02:27:52.881
When did she leave?

3073
02:27:52.964 --> 02:27:54.091
I don't know.

3074
02:27:54.216 --> 02:27:55.342
Oh.

3075
02:28:02.015 --> 02:28:03.558
- Hello.
- Sammy.

3076
02:28:03.642 --> 02:28:05.352
Yeah. Who's this? Nick?

3077
02:28:05.685 --> 02:28:07.187
Yeah. You okay?

3078
02:28:07.270 --> 02:28:09.356
No, I'm not okay. How'd you know I was here?

3079
02:28:09.439 --> 02:28:11.108
I just wanted to talk to you.

3080
02:28:11.483 --> 02:28:12.567
Ginger's missing.

3081
02:28:12.651 --> 02:28:14.027
She tied Amy up in her room.

3082
02:28:14.111 --> 02:28:16.446
I gotta find her. I don't know where she is.

3083
02:28:16.571 --> 02:28:18.907
Ginger's at the Leaning Tower with me.

3084
02:28:19.157 --> 02:28:21.076
She's there with you?

3085
02:28:21.159 --> 02:28:23.370
- <i>Yeah, she's here.</i>
- I'll be right over.

3086
02:28:23.453 --> 02:28:24.830
All right.

3087
02:28:27.749 --> 02:28:28.959
Coming over.

3088
02:28:29.126 --> 02:28:30.377
Great.

3089
02:28:35.715 --> 02:28:38.009
Ace, listen, don't make a scene, all right?

3090
02:28:38.093 --> 02:28:39.594
I want to talk to her.

3091
02:28:39.761 --> 02:28:41.304
She didn't know who to turn to.

3092
02:28:41.388 --> 02:28:43.181
She's trying to save your marriage.

3093
02:28:43.265 --> 02:28:44.724
Nicky, I want to talk to that fucking bitch.

3094
02:28:44.850 --> 02:28:46.309
Hey-

3095
02:28:46.393 --> 02:28:47.769
Be fucking nice.

3096
02:28:48.270 --> 02:28:49.396
Calm.

3097
02:28:49.938 --> 02:28:51.189
Be nice.

3098
02:28:52.107 --> 02:28:53.984
Don't fuck up in here.

3099
02:29:03.743 --> 02:29:05.537
- Hi, Sam.
- Are you out of your fucking mind?

3100
02:29:05.620 --> 02:29:07.998
You tie up our kid
and lock the fucking door?

3101
02:29:08.081 --> 02:29:10.041
Are you out of your mind?

3102
02:29:10.125 --> 02:29:12.544
That's our child. Are you out of your mind?

3103
02:29:12.627 --> 02:29:14.087
It was just for a while.

3104
02:29:14.212 --> 02:29:15.630
The baby-sitter wasn't there.

3105
02:29:15.714 --> 02:29:17.132
I ought to fucking have you committed.

3106
02:29:17.299 --> 02:29:18.717
You do that again, I'll...

3107
02:29:18.800 --> 02:29:21.219
I was just gonna be out for a little while.

3108
02:29:21.303 --> 02:29:22.971
She was asleep.

3109
02:29:23.138 --> 02:29:24.848
I was gonna be back before she woke up.

3110
02:29:24.931 --> 02:29:27.601
Listen, you fucking cunt. Listen to me.

3111
02:29:27.684 --> 02:29:29.394
- Fuck you.
- Let me tell you something.

3112
02:29:29.478 --> 02:29:31.563
Listen to me. Listen carefully.

3113
02:29:31.646 --> 02:29:34.774
You ever touch her again,
you ever do anything like that again,

3114
02:29:34.858 --> 02:29:37.444
I'll fucking kill you, pure and simple.

3115
02:29:37.527 --> 02:29:38.987
Pure and fucking simple.

3116
02:29:39.112 --> 02:29:40.572
Why don't you just let me go?

3117
02:29:40.655 --> 02:29:42.115
You fucking whore.

3118
02:29:42.240 --> 02:29:43.742
I'll sign anything you want me to.

3119
02:29:43.825 --> 02:29:46.495
I just want the key to
my jewelry and you to let me go.

3120
02:29:46.578 --> 02:29:48.413
- You want your jewelry?
- Let me go.

3121
02:29:48.497 --> 02:29:51.583
And let you disgrace me, you fucking pig?

3122
02:29:51.666 --> 02:29:53.043
Get up and be a mother.

3123
02:29:53.126 --> 02:29:54.628
Get in the car and go
to the house right now.

3124
02:29:54.878 --> 02:29:57.255
Get up and get in the...

3125
02:29:57.339 --> 02:29:59.090
Get up. Get up!

3126
02:29:59.174 --> 02:30:00.550
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

3127
02:30:00.675 --> 02:30:02.093
Get up. Get up.

3128
02:30:02.177 --> 02:30:04.846
Get going. Get up! Get the...

3129
02:30:04.930 --> 02:30:06.056
Are you threatening me?

3130
02:30:06.181 --> 02:30:07.307
I'll fucking kill you in this place.

3131
02:30:07.390 --> 02:30:08.934
Get up and go home.

3132
02:30:09.017 --> 02:30:11.144
- I'm going!
- You...

3133
02:30:17.234 --> 02:30:18.568
You need approval from him to go home?

3134
02:30:18.693 --> 02:30:20.028
So what?

3135
02:30:20.111 --> 02:30:23.156
Who fucking blew you in the
parking lot before you came in?

3136
02:30:23.240 --> 02:30:25.200
You make me sick, you fucking...

3137
02:30:25.283 --> 02:30:26.535
Once a hooker, always a hooker.

3138
02:30:26.660 --> 02:30:27.911
Oh, fuck you!

3139
02:30:27.994 --> 02:30:30.997
Fuck you, Sam Rothstein! Fuck you!

3140
02:30:32.332 --> 02:30:33.583
<i>I can't get me no</i>

3141
02:30:33.708 --> 02:30:34.960
<i>Satisfaction</i>

3142
02:30:35.043 --> 02:30:36.211
<i>I can't get no</i>

3143
02:30:36.336 --> 02:30:37.504
<i>Satisfaction</i>

3144
02:30:38.255 --> 02:30:40.298
Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.

3145
02:30:40.382 --> 02:30:41.466
<i>Who's this?</i>

3146
02:30:41.591 --> 02:30:42.676
Billy, I'll explain later.

3147
02:30:42.759 --> 02:30:44.177
You got a gun at home?

3148
02:30:44.302 --> 02:30:45.679
Bring it over right away.

3149
02:30:45.762 --> 02:30:47.806
- Take it easy. I'll do it.
- Okay.

3150
02:30:52.269 --> 02:30:54.229
Leave it where it is!

3151
02:30:56.439 --> 02:30:58.233
Where is he? I want that Jew bastard killed!

3152
02:30:58.358 --> 02:31:00.110
Calm down.

3153
02:31:00.193 --> 02:31:01.319
Hide her car in the back.

3154
02:31:01.403 --> 02:31:03.863
There's no reason to. He already knows!

3155
02:31:05.240 --> 02:31:06.658
What did I say?

3156
02:31:06.783 --> 02:31:08.159
Supposing he goes home and makes a beef?

3157
02:31:08.243 --> 02:31:10.412
I gotta know exactly what you said.

3158
02:31:10.495 --> 02:31:13.039
Me? I said nothing. I said, "No, no, no."

3159
02:31:13.164 --> 02:31:15.709
Everything he Must kept saying mm

3160
02:31:15.792 --> 02:31:18.169
I told you this was fucking dangerous.

3161
02:31:18.253 --> 02:31:21.631
I said, "Ginger, this is a dangerous situation.
Be very careful."

3162
02:31:21.715 --> 02:31:24.342
If it's so dangerous,
why don't you kill him?

3163
02:31:24.426 --> 02:31:26.595
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up.

3164
02:31:26.678 --> 02:31:28.763
Have him killed, and get it over with!

3165
02:31:28.888 --> 02:31:30.974
Don't be such a smart ass!

3166
02:31:31.057 --> 02:31:34.227
I know the guy 35 years,
I'm gonna fucking whack him for you?

3167
02:31:35.937 --> 02:31:37.397
Motherfucker.

3168
02:31:38.023 --> 02:31:39.691
I knew this. I knew it.

3169
02:31:39.816 --> 02:31:41.484
What about my money?

3170
02:31:42.360 --> 02:31:44.904
How the fuck am I gonna get your money now?

3171
02:31:44.988 --> 02:31:47.782
You think he's gonna give you fucking money?

3172
02:31:47.866 --> 02:31:49.784
Look what you did to this fucking guy!

3173
02:31:49.868 --> 02:31:51.953
If you would have just kept
your fucking mouth shut.

3174
02:31:52.037 --> 02:31:53.371
What the fuck is the use!

3175
02:31:53.455 --> 02:31:55.707
I should've never got involved. Hey.

3176
02:31:58.168 --> 02:32:00.086
You motherfucker, you!

3177
02:32:01.004 --> 02:32:02.380
You fuck! You fucker!

3178
02:32:02.505 --> 02:32:03.882
Get the fuck out of here.

3179
02:32:03.965 --> 02:32:06.384
Get out! Get the fuck out!

3180
02:32:06.718 --> 02:32:09.512
Oh, calm down. Take it easy!

3181
02:32:09.804 --> 02:32:12.891
Get up! I should never have gotten involved!

3182
02:32:12.974 --> 02:32:15.226
You'll fucking kill her. Take it easy.

3183
02:32:15.310 --> 02:32:17.395
Get her out of here.

3184
02:32:17.479 --> 02:32:18.980
Let's go. That's right.

3185
02:32:19.105 --> 02:32:20.607
Get the fuck out of here.

3186
02:32:23.068 --> 02:32:24.861
I don't need you!

3187
02:32:24.944 --> 02:32:27.364
I'll get my own fucking money!

3188
02:32:27.447 --> 02:32:28.657
All right, all right.

3189
02:32:28.740 --> 02:32:30.158
I'm going to the FBI!

3190
02:32:30.325 --> 02:32:31.743
I'm not scared anymore!

3191
02:32:31.826 --> 02:32:33.495
Be careful.

3192
02:32:33.620 --> 02:32:35.246
You've fucked with me for the last time!

3193
02:32:35.330 --> 02:32:36.706
Okay, yeah.

3194
02:32:38.333 --> 02:32:41.419
Be careful. Okay. Come on. Get inside.

3195
02:32:42.462 --> 02:32:43.797
Can you believe that?

3196
02:32:43.922 --> 02:32:45.298
Look at this motherfucker.

3197
02:32:48.385 --> 02:32:50.178
I fucked up, Frankie.

3198
02:32:50.345 --> 02:32:52.138
I fucked up good this time.

3199
02:32:52.222 --> 02:32:55.558
I should never have started
with this fucking broad.

3200
02:32:55.809 --> 02:32:57.936
Take it easy. What could you do?

3201
02:32:58.061 --> 02:33:00.230
I mean, she threw herself at you, right?

3202
02:33:03.858 --> 02:33:05.777
I'm in a bad fucking spot here.

3203
02:33:05.902 --> 02:33:07.862
You know that? Huh?

3204
02:33:09.489 --> 02:33:11.116
Bad fucking spot.

3205
02:33:26.715 --> 02:33:28.675
<i>I'd left the kid with neighbors</i>

3206
02:33:28.758 --> 02:33:30.593
<i>and I had $1 million in cash and jewels</i>

3207
02:33:30.719 --> 02:33:32.554
<i>that I gave to Sherbert to lock up.</i>

3208
02:33:32.637 --> 02:33:36.391
Put it in the hotel safe,
then I want you to come right back.

3209
02:34:08.298 --> 02:34:09.382
She's alone.

3210
02:34:09.466 --> 02:34:10.508
Take the gun and go into Amy's.

3211
02:34:10.592 --> 02:34:11.885
Wait there for me.

3212
02:34:11.968 --> 02:34:15.221
Get down here and talk to me, God damn it!

3213
02:34:15.305 --> 02:34:18.850
Don't fucking ignore me, you motherfucker!

3214
02:34:18.933 --> 02:34:20.852
I mean it!

3215
02:34:20.935 --> 02:34:23.730
You come down here right now!

3216
02:34:23.813 --> 02:34:27.192
Get down here and talk to me, God damn it!

3217
02:34:27.275 --> 02:34:30.278
Fuck you! God damn you, come out here!

3218
02:34:30.361 --> 02:34:34.616
I'm gonna drive your fucking
car through the living room!

3219
02:34:34.699 --> 02:34:36.618
You fucking coward!

3220
02:34:36.743 --> 02:34:38.661
You motherfucker, you!

3221
02:34:38.745 --> 02:34:41.539
Come out here and talk to me, you fucker!

3222
02:34:41.623 --> 02:34:42.665
Will you stop it?

3223
02:34:42.749 --> 02:34:43.750
You're drunk. You're on drugs.

3224
02:34:43.833 --> 02:34:44.793
I am not!

3225
02:34:44.918 --> 02:34:48.463
You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop it.
Don't you threaten me!

3226
02:34:50.131 --> 02:34:52.926
You are not threatening me anymore!

3227
02:34:53.009 --> 02:34:56.387
You fuck! You fuck! I'm sick of you!

3228
02:34:56.471 --> 02:34:58.681
I am fucking Nicky Santoro! I am!

3229
02:34:58.807 --> 02:35:01.017
He's my new sponsor!

3230
02:35:01.100 --> 02:35:03.561
How about that, you fuckhead!

3231
02:35:03.645 --> 02:35:05.688
What are you looking at? Fuck off!

3232
02:35:05.772 --> 02:35:07.774
- Hey. Hey.
- Go inside!

3233
02:35:07.857 --> 02:35:09.984
This is none of your business!

3234
02:35:10.109 --> 02:35:12.195
I don't have to take your shit anymore!

3235
02:35:12.278 --> 02:35:13.571
Hey

3236
02:35:13.696 --> 02:35:14.989
I'll go to the FBI! I will go to the police!

3237
02:35:15.073 --> 02:35:16.574
I am not protecting you anymore!

3238
02:35:16.699 --> 02:35:18.243
Mrs. Rothstein. Okay.

3239
02:35:18.326 --> 02:35:19.285
He won't let me inside!

3240
02:35:20.620 --> 02:35:21.621
He won't let me inside!

3241
02:35:21.704 --> 02:35:23.748
Mr. Rothstein, I'm sorry.

3242
02:35:23.832 --> 02:35:26.209
We've been getting some
complaints about the noise.

3243
02:35:26.292 --> 02:35:27.627
I'm trying to get in my house.

3244
02:35:27.752 --> 02:35:29.087
He won't let me in.

3245
02:35:29.170 --> 02:35:31.631
I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in.

3246
02:35:31.714 --> 02:35:34.092
I'm not gonna let her in
the way she's behaving.

3247
02:35:34.175 --> 02:35:35.176
Who knows what you'll do in there.

3248
02:35:35.301 --> 02:35:36.302
What?

3249
02:35:36.386 --> 02:35:38.179
I've been in the same clothes for two days!

3250
02:35:38.346 --> 02:35:40.098
I want to get some things!

3251
02:35:40.181 --> 02:35:43.601
How about we just let her in
the house to get a few things?

3252
02:35:43.685 --> 02:35:44.811
This is half her house.

3253
02:35:44.936 --> 02:35:46.062
I'm afraid to.

3254
02:35:46.145 --> 02:35:47.564
You aren't afraid, you fucker!

3255
02:35:47.689 --> 02:35:49.148
Let me in the house!

3256
02:35:49.232 --> 02:35:50.942
- Hey.
- All right.

3257
02:35:51.025 --> 02:35:52.402
- Please!
- Fucker!

3258
02:35:52.485 --> 02:35:54.988
You ought to be afraid,
the way you fucking treat me!

3259
02:35:55.071 --> 02:35:57.282
It'll make it easier on everybody.

3260
02:35:57.365 --> 02:36:00.076
Let her get her things,
we'll be out of your hair.

3261
02:36:00.159 --> 02:36:01.578
If she calms down, I will let her in.

3262
02:36:01.703 --> 02:36:03.162
I am calm!

3263
02:36:03.246 --> 02:36:04.497
No, you're not.

3264
02:36:04.622 --> 02:36:05.874
If she calms down,

3265
02:36:05.957 --> 02:36:08.001
I will let her in for five minutes

3266
02:36:08.084 --> 02:36:09.961
if you gentlemen will escort her out

3267
02:36:10.086 --> 02:36:11.963
if she happens to not want to leave.

3268
02:36:12.046 --> 02:36:14.090
- Can I go in?
- That's not a problem.

3269
02:36:14.173 --> 02:36:15.758
Jeff, would you go in with her?

3270
02:36:15.884 --> 02:36:17.510
Yes. Fine! Fuck you!

3271
02:36:20.388 --> 02:36:22.140
You won't believe how mean he is.

3272
02:36:22.223 --> 02:36:23.808
He's locked up my important stuff.

3273
02:36:23.933 --> 02:36:25.518
All my papers. I have to get them.

3274
02:36:25.602 --> 02:36:27.812
Don't let him come up.

3275
02:36:27.937 --> 02:36:30.148
I know they're in the desk. Fuck.

3276
02:36:32.984 --> 02:36:34.611
Just pay attention.

3277
02:36:34.736 --> 02:36:36.404
He could come up here at any time.

3278
02:36:39.574 --> 02:36:41.576
Are you watching for him?

3279
02:36:43.828 --> 02:36:44.996
Got them.

3280
02:36:46.789 --> 02:36:49.667
I don't want her in there
more than a few more minutes.

3281
02:36:49.751 --> 02:36:51.753
We got other things to do, too.

3282
02:36:54.839 --> 02:36:56.507
I'll hurry her up.

3283
02:36:57.091 --> 02:36:58.259
How's everything else besides this?

3284
02:36:58.384 --> 02:36:59.552
Fine.

3285
02:36:59.636 --> 02:37:00.845
How's your family?

3286
02:37:00.929 --> 02:37:03.514
Not bad. In fact, my wife's pregnant again.

3287
02:37:03.932 --> 02:37:05.433
Oh, good. Congratulations.

3288
02:37:05.600 --> 02:37:07.101
Thanks. Yeah.

3289
02:37:07.936 --> 02:37:09.729
We're kind of happy about that.

3290
02:37:09.812 --> 02:37:13.483
I just have to get this one
more thing and then we can go.

3291
02:37:13.566 --> 02:37:15.860
Shit! Fuck!

3292
02:37:15.944 --> 02:37:17.695
Shit! God!

3293
02:37:17.779 --> 02:37:21.074
Oh, that pisses me off!
Don't worry about it.

3294
02:37:23.117 --> 02:37:25.453
It would be great if you
guys follow me out of here,

3295
02:37:25.578 --> 02:37:27.914
because he's been threatening me.

3296
02:37:27.997 --> 02:37:29.916
Take care. Thank you.

3297
02:38:02.490 --> 02:38:04.242
I just need to pick up a little cash.

3298
02:38:04.367 --> 02:38:06.160
Could you come with me?

3299
02:38:12.417 --> 02:38:14.043
You've got to stop her.

3300
02:38:14.168 --> 02:38:15.795
<i>I'm sorry, Sam. What can I do?</i>

3301
02:38:15.878 --> 02:38:17.255
She's a fucking junkie.

3302
02:38:17.380 --> 02:38:18.756
She's out of her fucking mind!

3303
02:38:18.840 --> 02:38:20.049
She has the keys.

3304
02:38:20.174 --> 02:38:21.426
It's still in both your names.

3305
02:38:21.884 --> 02:38:23.052
I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.

3306
02:38:23.177 --> 02:38:24.345
I'd like to help.

3307
02:38:24.429 --> 02:38:26.556
Legally, she can't take that stuff.

3308
02:38:26.681 --> 02:38:28.850
Half of everything is mine.

3309
02:38:28.933 --> 02:38:30.226
<i>There's nothing I can do.</i>

3310
02:38:30.351 --> 02:38:31.686
I'm coming down.

3311
02:38:44.991 --> 02:38:46.951
Shit. God damn it.

3312
02:38:48.202 --> 02:38:50.079
I'm gonna need a bag.

3313
02:38:50.204 --> 02:38:52.123
If you could just ask
the guy for the big bag.

3314
02:38:52.206 --> 02:38:53.249
Go get a bag, man.

3315
02:38:53.374 --> 02:38:54.459
Here, here.

3316
02:38:54.542 --> 02:38:56.419
Lady, I can't take it.

3317
02:38:56.544 --> 02:38:58.504
No, you can. You've been so nice to me.

3318
02:38:59.297 --> 02:39:01.007
Just hold the top open, all right?

3319
02:39:01.132 --> 02:39:02.341
And I can...

3320
02:39:06.429 --> 02:39:09.348
Oh, God, it's him. You have to stop him.

3321
02:39:09.432 --> 02:39:11.059
He said he was gonna kill me.

3322
02:39:11.184 --> 02:39:12.769
You should just stop him.

3323
02:39:12.852 --> 02:39:15.646
Mr. Rothstein, wait a minute.

3324
02:39:15.730 --> 02:39:18.232
Hold on a second. Hold on a second.

3325
02:39:18.941 --> 02:39:20.693
She's driving away.

3326
02:39:20.777 --> 02:39:22.820
There's nothing we can do.

3327
02:39:22.904 --> 02:39:24.072
Look, look.

3328
02:39:24.197 --> 02:39:25.323
You can't stop her for speeding?

3329
02:39:25.406 --> 02:39:27.450
Look what she's doing.

3330
02:39:27.533 --> 02:39:29.494
She had the keys.

3331
02:39:29.619 --> 02:39:31.621
She's on the account.

3332
02:39:31.704 --> 02:39:33.164
Let's pull her over at that Cit-go station.

3333
02:39:33.289 --> 02:39:34.791
Okay. Let's do it.

3334
02:39:45.843 --> 02:39:47.303
We're placing you under arrest for...

3335
02:39:47.428 --> 02:39:48.930
For what?

3336
02:39:49.013 --> 02:39:52.350
We're placing you under
arrest for aiding and abetting...

3337
02:39:52.433 --> 02:39:53.976
For aiding and abetting...

3338
02:39:54.102 --> 02:39:55.686
But I'm just trying to leave.

3339
02:39:55.770 --> 02:39:57.772
<i>After all the threats and the bullshit,</i>

3340
02:39:57.939 --> 02:39:59.899
<i>Ginger didn't tell them anything.</i>

3341
02:39:59.982 --> 02:40:02.151
<i>By then the Feds didn't need her anyway.</i>

3342
02:40:02.235 --> 02:40:03.611
But it was mine.

3343
02:40:03.694 --> 02:40:05.363
<i>They had all they needed.</i>

3344
02:40:05.446 --> 02:40:06.572
I didn't do anything.

3345
02:40:06.656 --> 02:40:08.366
<i>Everybody began to tumble...</i>

3346
02:40:08.449 --> 02:40:09.700
FBI! We have a warrant!

3347
02:40:09.784 --> 02:40:12.203
<i>...one after the other, like dominoes.</i>

3348
02:40:12.286 --> 02:40:14.539
<i>Between Piscano complaining on the wire,</i>

3349
02:40:14.622 --> 02:40:17.875
<i>Nicky, Ginger, me and my license,</i>

3350
02:40:17.959 --> 02:40:21.712
<i>paradise, we managed
to really fuck it all up.</i>

3351
02:40:21.796 --> 02:40:23.464
Mom.

3352
02:40:23.589 --> 02:40:25.216
Yeah, someone's at the fucking door.

3353
02:40:25.299 --> 02:40:27.218
FBI. We have a search warrant.

3354
02:40:27.301 --> 02:40:30.429
<i>I got wind of the pinches coming
down, so I took off.</i>

3355
02:40:30.513 --> 02:40:32.557
<i>Who needs to hang around for that?</i>

3356
02:40:32.640 --> 02:40:34.308
My name is Mark Casper, FBI.

3357
02:40:34.475 --> 02:40:36.185
Can I make a fucking phone call?

3358
02:40:36.269 --> 02:40:39.230
Hold on. Make a phone call but
don't talk to us like that.

3359
02:40:39.313 --> 02:40:40.648
Everybody, out of the room.

3360
02:40:40.773 --> 02:40:42.066
Over to the alarm.

3361
02:40:42.150 --> 02:40:44.110
<i>But they got almost everybody else.</i>

3362
02:40:44.193 --> 02:40:46.028
This area is seized!

3363
02:40:46.404 --> 02:40:47.822
Get the master account list.

3364
02:40:47.905 --> 02:40:50.950
I want all papers seized,
regardless of what they are.

3365
02:40:53.828 --> 02:40:55.955
Put every box on the table.

3366
02:41:01.836 --> 02:41:06.424
Oh, yes. Here we are. Little craps figures.

3367
02:41:06.507 --> 02:41:08.050
<i>Green? Don't even ask.</i>

3368
02:41:08.134 --> 02:41:09.177
...$30,000 of yours.

3369
02:41:09.343 --> 02:41:10.428
It wasn't valid.

3370
02:41:10.511 --> 02:41:12.263
I was being extorted.

3371
02:41:12.346 --> 02:41:13.681
I'll tell you what you want to know.

3372
02:41:13.848 --> 02:41:15.224
I've got nothing to hide.

3373
02:41:15.308 --> 02:41:18.102
<i>Now for the best.
I couldn't believe this shit.</i>

3374
02:41:18.186 --> 02:41:20.438
<i>Piscano's expense reports took the cake.</i>

3375
02:41:20.521 --> 02:41:21.898
This is good. Bingo.

3376
02:41:21.981 --> 02:41:24.317
<i>He might as well
have given them a blueprint.</i>

3377
02:41:24.400 --> 02:41:27.445
<i>Names, addresses, dates, everything.</i>

3378
02:41:27.528 --> 02:41:28.613
Look at this.

3379
02:41:28.696 --> 02:41:29.989
Thank you so much, Mr. Piscano.

3380
02:41:30.114 --> 02:41:31.449
How considerate of you.

3381
02:41:31.532 --> 02:41:32.700
Those are my mother's books.

3382
02:41:32.867 --> 02:41:34.076
You're under arrest.

3383
02:41:34.160 --> 02:41:35.953
<i>Fucking balloon-head.</i>

3384
02:41:36.037 --> 02:41:37.788
What are you doing?

3385
02:41:37.914 --> 02:41:39.665
Wait! Wait a minute! He's sick!

3386
02:41:39.749 --> 02:41:41.584
Move back.

3387
02:41:41.709 --> 02:41:43.544
God! It's his heart! Is he breathing?

3388
02:41:43.628 --> 02:41:45.880
<i>Artie got so upset, he had a heart attack</i>

3389
02:41:46.047 --> 02:41:48.257
<i>and dropped dead in front of his wife.</i>

3390
02:41:48.382 --> 02:41:50.509
- Calm down!
- Artie! No, I won't calm down!

3391
02:41:50.593 --> 02:41:52.637
- He's my husband!
- We can't help...

3392
02:41:56.682 --> 02:42:00.478
<i>And at the end of the day,
they came to see me with the pictures.</i>

3393
02:42:00.561 --> 02:42:03.231
Why protect a friend who betrayed you?

3394
02:42:03.314 --> 02:42:04.815
<i>But I didn't want to look at them.</i>

3395
02:42:04.899 --> 02:42:08.110
<i>I didn't want to look at the
guys who brought them either.</i>

3396
02:42:10.488 --> 02:42:14.075
Your honor, as you can see,
my clients are elderly and infirm.

3397
02:42:14.158 --> 02:42:17.245
Any incarceration could
pose a serious health risk.

3398
02:42:17.328 --> 02:42:19.372
<i>Some of the bosses were so old,</i>

3399
02:42:19.497 --> 02:42:21.499
<i>they needed doctors at their arraignment.</i>

3400
02:42:21.582 --> 02:42:23.751
Pre-trial services recommends bail as set.

3401
02:42:23.918 --> 02:42:26.045
We're going to take a recess.

3402
02:42:26.128 --> 02:42:28.256
<i>When it looked like
they could get 25 years to life</i>

3403
02:42:28.422 --> 02:42:30.549
<i>for skimming a casino,</i>

3404
02:42:30.633 --> 02:42:34.262
<i>sick or no fucking sick,
people were going to get clipped.</i>

3405
02:42:35.221 --> 02:42:39.558
<i>The day of the arraignment, they had this
meeting in the back of the courthouse.</i>

3406
02:42:39.642 --> 02:42:41.602
<i>See, when something like this happens,</i>

3407
02:42:41.769 --> 02:42:43.729
<i>you know how things are gonna work out.</i>

3408
02:42:43.813 --> 02:42:46.524
<i>It's always better with no witnesses.</i>

3409
02:42:46.607 --> 02:42:48.192
<i>So what about Andy?</i>

3410
02:42:48.276 --> 02:42:51.237
He won't talk. Stone is a good kid.

3411
02:42:51.320 --> 02:42:53.572
Stand-up guy just like his old man.

3412
02:42:53.656 --> 02:42:55.491
That's the way I see it.

3413
02:42:55.574 --> 02:42:58.869
I agree. He's solid. He's a fucking Marine.

3414
02:42:59.578 --> 02:43:01.622
He's okay. He always was.

3415
02:43:02.164 --> 02:43:04.125
Remo, what do you think?

3416
02:43:05.334 --> 02:43:06.669
Look,

3417
02:43:08.254 --> 02:43:09.922
why take a chance?

3418
02:43:11.590 --> 02:43:14.051
At least, that's the way I feel about it.

3419
02:43:14.135 --> 02:43:17.722
Call Artie. Tell him, I don't care what.

3420
02:43:17.805 --> 02:43:21.017
He's got to be in my office
Thursday morning before 11:00.

3421
02:43:21.100 --> 02:43:22.643
It's important.

3422
02:43:22.810 --> 02:43:24.395
I gotta have & conversation with that guy...

3423
02:43:32.361 --> 02:43:35.072
<i>As much as they liked
him, he wasn't one of us.</i>

3424
02:43:35.156 --> 02:43:36.782
<i>He wasn't Italian.</i>

3425
02:43:36.907 --> 02:43:38.492
<i>As far as they knew, he could have talked.</i>

3426
02:43:38.576 --> 02:43:41.162
<i>Otherwise, Stoney might still be alive.</i>

3427
02:43:45.333 --> 02:43:47.752
<i>The first one to skip was John Nance.</i>

3428
02:43:47.835 --> 02:43:51.005
<i>He found a nice, warm,
secluded place in Costa Rica.</i>

3429
02:43:51.088 --> 02:43:52.715
<i>He thought nobody would find him there.</i>

3430
02:44:14.320 --> 02:44:17.323
<i>But then his kid got
nabbed by the Feds for drugs.</i>

3431
02:44:17.406 --> 02:44:20.451
<i>Naturally, the bosses were
afraid he'd come out of hiding</i>

3432
02:44:20.534 --> 02:44:23.037
<i>just to save his kid and give them all up.</i>

3433
02:44:23.829 --> 02:44:24.914
<i>So...</i>

3434
02:44:27.917 --> 02:44:29.794
Where you going, jag-off?

3435
02:44:31.545 --> 02:44:33.255
<i>But, anyway, they all had to follow.</i>

3436
02:44:33.381 --> 02:44:35.132
<i>Everybody went down.</i>

3437
02:44:35.466 --> 02:44:36.717
Fuck you.

3438
02:44:42.139 --> 02:44:44.183
<i>Before you knew it,
anybody who knew anything</i>

3439
02:44:44.308 --> 02:44:46.394
<i>wound up getting whacked.</i>

3440
02:44:55.277 --> 02:44:57.696
<i>Oh, no! No. No.</i>

3441
02:45:02.118 --> 02:45:04.870
<i>After Ginger took off,
she wasn't much help to anybody.</i>

3442
02:45:04.954 --> 02:45:08.791
<i>She found some pimps, lowlifes,
druggies and bikers in I.A.</i>

3443
02:45:08.874 --> 02:45:10.793
<i>In a few months,
they went through all the money</i>

3444
02:45:10.918 --> 02:45:12.878
<i>and all the jewels.</i>

3445
02:45:15.089 --> 02:45:19.301
<i>To wear that ball and chain</i>

3446
02:45:29.061 --> 02:45:34.775
<i>Well, there is a house in New Orleans</i>

3447
02:45:38.362 --> 02:45:43.284
<i>After they found her body,
I had a private doctor do another autopsy.</i>

3448
02:45:46.704 --> 02:45:49.623
<i>He said they gave her a hot dose.</i>

3449
02:45:49.707 --> 02:45:55.463
<i>In the end, all she had left was
$3,600 in mint condition coins.</i>

3450
02:46:16.567 --> 02:46:18.569
<i>No matter what the Feds or the papers</i>

3451
02:46:18.694 --> 02:46:20.738
<i>might have said about my car bombing,</i>

3452
02:46:21.864 --> 02:46:24.074
<i>it was amateur night, you could tell.</i>

3453
02:46:24.158 --> 02:46:28.162
<i>Whoever it was, they put the
dynamite under the passenger side.</i>

3454
02:46:28.245 --> 02:46:31.790
<i>But what they didn't know,
what nobody outside the factory knew,</i>

3455
02:46:31.874 --> 02:46:34.084
<i>was that that model car was made</i>

3456
02:46:34.210 --> 02:46:36.462
<i>with a metal plate under the driver's seat.</i>

3457
02:46:37.171 --> 02:46:39.632
<i>It's the only thing that saved my life.</i>

3458
02:46:52.061 --> 02:46:54.230
<i>The bombing was never authorized</i>

3459
02:46:54.355 --> 02:46:56.524
<i>but I suspect I know who lit the fuse.</i>

3460
02:46:56.607 --> 02:46:57.691
Hey, Nicky.

3461
02:46:57.775 --> 02:46:59.610
<i>And so did the powers that be.</i>

3462
02:46:59.693 --> 02:47:01.070
- Hi.
- How you doing?

3463
02:47:01.153 --> 02:47:03.781
<i>It took months for everything to calm down.</i>

3464
02:47:03.864 --> 02:47:06.116
<i>But, finally, my guys got out on bail,</i>

3465
02:47:06.200 --> 02:47:07.952
<i>and the bosses wanted me to send</i>

3466
02:47:08.077 --> 02:47:09.787
<i>my brother Dominick out to Vegas.</i>

3467
02:47:09.870 --> 02:47:11.580
<i>Always the dollars.</i>

3468
02:47:11.705 --> 02:47:13.457
<i>Always the fucking dollars.</i>

3469
02:47:13.541 --> 02:47:16.835
<i>I mean, it was still way too hot
for me to even go near Vegas.</i>

3470
02:47:16.919 --> 02:47:19.713
<i>So I set up a meeting with the
guys way out in the sticks.</i>

3471
02:47:19.797 --> 02:47:21.799
<i>I didn't want my brother fucked around.</i>

3472
02:47:21.882 --> 02:47:23.384
<i>What's right is right.</i>

3473
02:47:23.509 --> 02:47:24.969
They don't give 8 fuck about...

3474
02:47:26.303 --> 02:47:28.305
Holy fucking...

3475
02:47:28.389 --> 02:47:29.974
What the fuck...

3476
02:47:30.057 --> 02:47:32.142
Come on, motherfucker!

3477
02:47:32.226 --> 02:47:36.146
Tough guy! You and your fucking brother!

3478
02:47:36.230 --> 02:47:39.567
You fucking scumbag! No more!

3479
02:47:42.570 --> 02:47:44.405
Frankie!

3480
02:47:44.572 --> 02:47:46.407
No more! You see? Watch!

3481
02:47:49.201 --> 02:47:51.996
Frankie! You piece of shit!

3482
02:47:52.079 --> 02:47:53.747
Fuck you, you motherfucker!

3483
02:47:53.831 --> 02:47:55.541
Fucking punk, motherfucker!

3484
02:47:55.666 --> 02:47:57.418
Piece of shit!

3485
02:48:00.254 --> 02:48:02.047
No! No! No! No!

3486
02:48:02.131 --> 02:48:04.383
Take this motherfucker out!

3487
02:48:04.967 --> 02:48:06.343
Oh...

3488
02:48:07.094 --> 02:48:09.597
Oh, Dominick.

3489
02:48:11.849 --> 02:48:13.976
Frankie, leave the kid alone.

3490
02:48:14.101 --> 02:48:16.270
He's still breathing. Leave him alone.

3491
02:48:17.521 --> 02:48:18.772
Frankie.

3492
02:48:22.693 --> 02:48:25.279
All right. Strip him.

3493
02:48:25.946 --> 02:48:28.782
No balls. You got no fucking balls.

3494
02:48:29.533 --> 02:48:31.660
Oh, Dominick.

3495
02:48:32.286 --> 02:48:34.038
Oh, Dominick.

3496
02:48:39.001 --> 02:48:41.211
Dominick. Dominick.

3497
02:48:42.963 --> 02:48:44.298
Dominick.

3498
02:48:47.635 --> 02:48:48.969
Dominick.

3499
02:49:03.734 --> 02:49:05.361
Come on, come on.

3500
02:49:08.322 --> 02:49:09.281
Bury them?

3501
02:49:09.406 --> 02:49:10.366
Bury them.

3502
02:49:13.577 --> 02:49:14.995
<i>The word was out.</i>

3503
02:49:15.162 --> 02:49:16.580
<i>The bosses had enough of Nicky.</i>

3504
02:49:16.664 --> 02:49:18.207
<i>They had enough.</i>

3505
02:49:18.332 --> 02:49:19.917
<i>How much were they gonna take?</i>

3506
02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.920
<i>So they made an example
of him and his brother.</i>

3507
02:49:23.462 --> 02:49:26.507
<i>They buried them while
they were still breathing.</i>

3508
02:49:43.357 --> 02:49:45.693
- Mister, you all right? Watch out!
- Yeah.

3509
02:49:51.323 --> 02:49:52.449
Mister, you all right?

3510
02:49:52.574 --> 02:49:53.701
Yeah.

3511
02:49:55.077 --> 02:49:57.204
<i>They had other ideas for me.</i>

3512
02:50:10.718 --> 02:50:12.386
You sure are lucky, mister.

3513
02:50:30.863 --> 02:50:33.282
<i>The town will never be the same.</i>

3514
02:50:33.365 --> 02:50:37.244
<i>After the Tangiers,
the big corporations took it all over.</i>

3515
02:50:37.911 --> 02:50:40.247
<i>Today it looks like Disneyland.</i>

3516
02:50:47.921 --> 02:50:49.965
<i>While the kids play cardboard pirates,</i>

3517
02:50:50.048 --> 02:50:53.635
<i>Mommy and Daddy drop house
payments and junior's college money</i>

3518
02:50:53.719 --> 02:50:55.345
<i>on the poker slots.</i>

3519
02:50:59.683 --> 02:51:01.393
<i>In the old days, dealers knew your name,</i>

3520
02:51:01.518 --> 02:51:03.187
<i>what you drank, what you played.</i>

3521
02:51:03.270 --> 02:51:05.439
<i>Today, it's like checking into an airport.</i>

3522
02:51:05.522 --> 02:51:09.109
<i>If you order room service,
you're lucky if you get it by Thursday.</i>

3523
02:51:10.277 --> 02:51:13.697
<i>Today it's all gone.
A whale shows up with $4 million in a suitcase</i>

3524
02:51:13.781 --> 02:51:15.824
<i>and some 25-year-old hotel school kid</i>

3525
02:51:15.949 --> 02:51:18.076
<i>is gonna want his Social Security number.</i>

3526
02:51:20.162 --> 02:51:22.206
<i>After the Teamsters
got knocked out of the box,</i>

3527
02:51:22.289 --> 02:51:25.626
<i>the corporations tore down
practically all the old casinos.</i>

3528
02:51:26.627 --> 02:51:29.630
<i>And where did the money come
from to rebuild the pyramids?</i>

3529
02:51:30.464 --> 02:51:31.799
<i>Junk bonds.</i>

3530
02:51:37.429 --> 02:51:38.972
Still not sure?

3531
02:51:39.515 --> 02:51:41.391
Probable. Maybe questionable.

3532
02:51:41.475 --> 02:51:43.894
Let me know as soon as you can find out.

3533
02:51:45.479 --> 02:51:48.607
<i>But in the end,
I wound up right back where I started.</i>

3534
02:51:48.690 --> 02:51:50.567
<i>I could still pick winners</i>

3535
02:51:50.651 --> 02:51:54.071
<i>and I could still make money for
all kinds of people back home.</i>

3536
02:51:54.154 --> 02:51:56.156
<i>And why mess up a good thing?</i>

3537
02:51:57.157 --> 02:51:58.784
<i>And that's that.</i>

3538
02:54:35.273 --> 02:54:38.986
<i>Sometimes I wonder why
I spend the lonely nights</i>

3539
02:54:41.530 --> 02:54:43.615
<i>Dreaming of a song</i>

3540
02:54:45.993 --> 02:54:49.997
<i>The melody haunts my reverie</i>

3541
02:54:53.709 --> 02:54:55.877
<i>And I am once again with you</i>

3542
02:55:00.674 --> 02:55:02.801
<i>When our love was new</i>

3543
02:55:04.428 --> 02:55:07.347
<i>And each kiss an inspiration</i>

3544
02:55:10.183 --> 02:55:12.394
<i>Ah, but that was long ago</i>

3545
02:55:14.438 --> 02:55:16.732
<i>And now my consolation</i>

3546
02:55:16.815 --> 02:55:18.984
<i>ls in the stardust of a song</i>

3547
02:55:23.363 --> 02:55:25.490
<i>Beside a garden wall</i>

3548
02:55:25.991 --> 02:55:27.993
<i>When stars were bright</i>

3549
02:55:28.618 --> 02:55:30.537
<i>And you were in my arms</i>

3550
02:55:33.165 --> 02:55:36.209
<i>The nightingale told his fairy tale</i>

3551
02:55:41.339 --> 02:55:44.885
<i>Of paradise where roses grew</i>

3552
02:55:50.390 --> 02:55:52.267
<i>Though I dream in vain</i>

3553
02:55:56.646 --> 02:56:00.567
<i>In my heart it will remain</i>

3554
02:56:03.403 --> 02:56:05.489
<i>My stardust melody</i>

3555
02:56:06.865 --> 02:56:11.870
<i>The memory of love's refrain</i>
