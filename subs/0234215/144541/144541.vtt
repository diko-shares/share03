[Sniffs]

3
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:16,348
Really?

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,683
[Sighs]

5
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:20,386
Erin?

6
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:22,521
Hey, Stephanie.

7
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:26,458
It's Lancaster now.

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,760
Congratulations.

9
00:00:27,762 --> 00:00:29,228
You need some help?

10
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,596
No. Thanks.

11
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:33,098
I've been meaning to upgrade
my luggage.

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,534
You know, we were all
just talking about you.

13
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,169
Yeah?

14
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:39,238
We didn't see your name
on the reunion page on Facebook.

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,507
Uh, yeah, you know, I saw that,

16
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:44,376
but I have a thing
that I have to get to, so...

17
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:48,180
So are you working?
What... what are you up to?

18
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:50,249
Uh, I'm a cop.

19
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:53,585
Seriously?

20
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:56,121
Seriously, I'm a cop.

21
00:00:56,123 --> 00:01:00,459
I would've thought
you'd be running from them.

22
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:03,529
Nope.

23
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:05,130
Well, come to the reunion.

24
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:06,832
And don't worry...
there are plenty of girls

25
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:08,500
who are still single who rsvp'd.

26
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,269
I think a big group of them

27
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:11,804
are renting a stretch hummer
or something.

28
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:15,541
Oh, and, plus,
you might meet someone.

29
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:18,377
But, hey, if not, I understand.

30
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:20,412
It's good seeing you.

31
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,388
[Breathing heavily]

32
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,535
I guess I got used to the dark.

33
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:44,837
What time do you go on?

34
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:47,139
[Breathing heavily]

35
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:49,608
The graveyard.

36
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,176
Well,
it looks like you picked up

37
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:53,278
some discipline inside, huh?

38
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,282
Yep.

39
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:00,285
Picked up a lot of things, pop.

40
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:04,623
Justin, I know you're not
loving this c.T.A. Gig, okay?

41
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,126
It's only temporary.

42
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:09,261
I just want to make sure
you don't fall into bad habits,

43
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:10,863
start running
with a crowd that'll...

44
00:02:10,865 --> 00:02:13,465
I love you, dad.

45
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,838
Is everything all right?

46
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:25,711
What, I can't tell you
that I love you sometimes?

47
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:28,780
[Cell phone vibrating]

48
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:37,322
Voight.

49
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,202
All right, thanks, guys.

50
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,309
- Don't tell me.
- Yeah.

51
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:59,678
Her name's Charlotte Matthews.

52
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,316
Everything matches
from the victim two days ago.

53
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:05,617
- Commander.
- Commander.

54
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,486
- Raped?
- Yeah.

55
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:08,520
And ear was cut off?

56
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:09,621
That's right.

57
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:13,292
In New York six months ago
similar to our two.

58
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:15,360
We've been in contact
with the detectives there.

59
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,434
Now, there are 600 reasons

60
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:24,770
why I didn't want you
in charge of this unit,

61
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:27,272
but there's one main reason
why I did...

62
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,241
cases like this.

63
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:32,277
You understand me?

64
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:34,313
I do.

65
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,457
Let me talk to my partner,
and I'll get back to you.

66
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,326
All right, sergeant.

67
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,728
Hey, you know the perp
that raped and killed

68
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,363
and cut the victim's ear off?

69
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:52,631
He just struck again
two hours ago

70
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,299
in Chicago's riverwalk.

71
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:55,634
Well, I sent them
all the files from our case

72
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:56,836
when their first one happened.

73
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,937
I don't know what more we can do
on our end.

74
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:00,339
Not much.

75
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:02,507
That's why
we're heading to Chicago.

76
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:12,718
.

77
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,320
- What's up?
- Morning, sarge.

78
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,389
Erin, good morning.

79
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:19,825
Have you noticed that platt,
like, loves you for some reason?

80
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:21,727
- Do you own a suit?
- Yeah, why?

81
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:23,729
You're going with me
to my high-school reunion.

82
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:26,765
Also, we're engaged.
[Door buzzer sounds]

83
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:27,966
W-wait.

84
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,606
You're still here?

85
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,742
Yeah.

86
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:38,777
I plan on being here
for a while.

87
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,712
Yeah?

88
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,314
Doing what, with whom?

89
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:44,916
Look, Al...

90
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,755
I'm telling you right now,
man-to-man,

91
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:52,491
I'm ready to do my job
the right way,

92
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:55,494
your way.

93
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:56,862
Okay, so what do you say...

94
00:04:56,864 --> 00:05:00,932
new day, new beginnings, please?

95
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:03,702
Look, I know I can be
a little overzealous, all right?

96
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:06,838
Growing up in the neighborhood
I grew up in...

97
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,908
I don't need
your life story, man.

98
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,877
I just need you to listen to me.

99
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,945
Yeah. Yeah.

100
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,549
Only when I think
you're gonna make it here,

101
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,384
and then you can tell me

102
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:23,855
all about how daddy
never bought you a skateboard.

103
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:29,761
You speak Italian?

104
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:32,731
[Speaking Italian]

105
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:35,600
- Where'd you pick it up?
- I was stationed in vicenza.

106
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:36,935
You served?

107
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,037
Yeah, a.B.C.T.,
part of a rapid response team.

108
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,073
It's about an hour away
from everyone.

109
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:42,075
You?

110
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:45,677
Rangers... Afghanistan.

111
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,112
Well, that explains a lot.

112
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:48,914
Were you ever injured
in the line of crushing grapes?

113
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,782
- Excuse me?
- Was that in world war ii?

114
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:54,419
- I can't hear you. What?
- Oh, my God.

115
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,092
These poor girls.

116
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:08,100
Media's calling him
"the riverwalk killer."

117
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:09,935
Mayor's flipping out
on the superintendent,

118
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:11,770
who's flipping out on the chief.

119
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:14,706
None of that matters to me.

120
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,844
And were put through something
so horrific...

121
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,416
It ain't gonna happen again.

122
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:25,917
There's no witnesses.

123
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,919
Area central searched
every crime scene

124
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,855
and came up blank
on physical evidence.

125
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:31,790
- Pods?
- Zero.

126
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,158
Detectives
from special victims unit

127
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,460
in New York are en route
right now to help out.

128
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:36,695
They also had two victims killed

129
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:38,897
in their city two days apart,

130
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,400
"and traffic cameras
picked up a male, white, 5'10"

131
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:42,801
wearing a hoodie
following both victims,

132
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:44,836
but they couldn't get
a clear visual on his face.

133
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,405
What about
registered sex offenders?

134
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:47,506
Nothing pops.

135
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:49,508
Plus, no DNA yet
off any of the victims.

136
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,743
Hey, we're not waiting around
for that.

137
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,079
We get proactive.

138
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,580
Boots on the ground.

139
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,048
I want everyone
working the river

140
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,717
looking for suspicious behavior.

141
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:00,786
Dress the part.

142
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,726
Burgess, I need a favor.

143
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:12,798
We're gonna need someone to man
the phones in intelligence.

144
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,767
So there's gonna be a lot
of calls coming in.

145
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,769
Yeah, I'm all over it.

146
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:23,475
Congratulations.
You made secretary.

147
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:25,143
Don't hate, appreciate.

148
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:26,778
Well, there's some fresh slang.

149
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,450
I'll be upstairs if you need me.

150
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:09,254
[Panting]

151
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:11,556
Oh, my God,
whoever is panting in the mic,

152
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:12,858
you're killing me right now.

153
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,760
Bite me, ruzek.
I've been running for an hour.

154
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,239
Can I start calling you Hank
or voight?

155
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:28,874
No.

156
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:31,576
Well, you know,
I'm reading this book right now.

157
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,879
It's called
<i>the magic of thinking big,</i>

158
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:35,947
wherein the author posits
that titles, you know,

159
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:38,283
they just cause this formal

160
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:41,887
and unnecessary separation
between people.

161
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:48,026
Can we do any better
on this image?

162
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,031
I'm working on it.

163
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:59,237
All right,
everyone check the ramp.

164
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:02,107
Eyes on a male...
white, brown hoodie.

165
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:03,174
In pursuit.

166
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,685
Hey!

167
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,787
Police! Let her go!

168
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,091
Hold on!

169
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:22,861
Ma'am, you okay?

170
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:31,836
Don't move!

171
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:34,072
I'm gonna crack you!
You hear me?

172
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,206
Give me your hand.

173
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,109
[Groans]

174
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,011
Offender in custody.

175
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:44,282
.

176
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:47,252
[Indistinct chatter]

177
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,021
Theo Mitchell,
and I don't think he's our guy.

178
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,259
Found four wallets
and three watches on him.

179
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,961
He's a pickpocket,
a purse-snatcher.

180
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:57,996
Four arrests in the last
ten years along those lines.

181
00:09:57,998 --> 00:10:01,032
No rape, no murder,
not even a sexual assault.

182
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,000
What?

183
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:03,969
What do you think?

184
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:07,639
Let's bring him in.

185
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:11,009
Come on. Come on.

186
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:12,644
Get in there.

187
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,985
This is a rail road, man.
Unbelievable.

188
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:22,354
I would never hurt
a woman, never.

189
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:24,689
I'm inclined to believe you.

190
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,358
Then what the hell
am I doing here

191
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,892
getting looked at for it?

192
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:31,029
Riverwalk's your turf
for pulling crimes, right?

193
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:34,065
Looks like you've had pretty
fertile grounds for a while.

194
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:36,901
Oh, oh, okay, I get it.

195
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,837
Threaten me with rape, murder,

196
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:40,405
and then admitting
to boosting some wallets

197
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:42,107
seems tame by comparison.

198
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:44,976
You know what? I'm out of here.

199
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,311
No, you're not.

200
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,947
Sizing people up
and then ripping them off,

201
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:51,116
I'm thinking maybe
you could help us find

202
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:55,020
who did rape and kill
those two girls...

203
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:57,389
Because my experience...

204
00:10:57,391 --> 00:11:00,392
a cheetah always knows
where the hyena is.

205
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:07,832
I like that analogy.
You went jungle on me.

206
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,370
Early this morning,
before 6:00 A.M.,

207
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:14,339
around east lake...

208
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,274
close your eyes and think.

209
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,243
[Sighs]

210
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:26,351
There was this dude...

211
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,287
Like, 5:00 A.M...

212
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,022
In running gear,

213
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,857
but he was just stretching
the whole time,

214
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,160
just looking around.

215
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:36,828
I remember thinking

216
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,430
he was either a criminal
or a cop,

217
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:41,366
but I ain't ever seen a cop
with a watch that nice, though.

218
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,736
[Scoffs]
How close did you get to him?

219
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:47,739
Real close.
I walked right by him.

220
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,120
What's up, office?

221
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,955
That's what you guys call
each other out here, right...

222
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:06,791
"office"?

223
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,993
Sergeant platt.
How can I help you?

224
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:11,296
Yeah, we're here to see
sergeant voight in intelligence.

225
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:14,299
We have some information
to share with him.

226
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,000
Regarding?

227
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:18,903
We're detectives from NYPD.
Sergeant voight is expecting us.

228
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,472
Oh, my God, you should have said

229
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:21,940
you were from New York City.

230
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:24,042
I'm mortified.

231
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:26,945
Why don't you park it
over there?

232
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,317
Hey, office burgess,

233
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:34,953
would you get your skinny ass
down here?

234
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:36,488
[Laughing] "Office."

235
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:42,460
Hey, appreciate you coming.

236
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:43,862
- Of course.
- Hank voight.

237
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:46,164
Hey, there. Rollins. Hi.

238
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,800
- All right, how you doing?
- How's it going?

239
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:49,868
- Okay.
- Jay.

240
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,102
You guys are nice.

241
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,338
What's up with that battle-ax
downstairs?

242
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,939
There isn't enough time
in the day.

243
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,841
Pleasure.

244
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:58,843
Start off looking
for patterns, obviously.

245
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:01,246
Why New York and now Chicago?

246
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:04,048
And this just happens
to be his route?

247
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,550
Maybe an interstate trucker?
Yeah.

248
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:07,318
The only commonality
that we could find

249
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,853
that might be worth pursuing,

250
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:11,322
is there was a manufacturing
trade show convention

251
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:14,192
in New York at the time
of our rape-murders.

252
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:17,095
Now, that convention is
now here in town

253
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,396
at the rittenton center?

254
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:19,964
- Rittenhouse, yeah.
- Yeah.

255
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,366
- Jin.
- Yeah, on it.

256
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:24,302
So who is this guy?
I mean, what are we looking for?

257
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:27,372
This perp has been elevated
to serial-killer status.

258
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:29,374
I mean, in terms
of the rape and murder,

259
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:31,576
there are five different
profile psyches.

260
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:35,046
I think we're looking
at an anger retaliatory rapist.

261
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:38,449
I mean, I get that
he's a sadistic son of a bitch

262
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,451
and everything,
but is he trying to establish

263
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:41,886
some sort of cred or...?

264
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:44,889
Usually as a souvenir
or a trophy.

265
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,357
Sometimes
they even make shrines.

266
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:49,861
- [Groans]
- Yuck.

267
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:51,896
How long we have you guys for?

268
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,198
As long as you need.

269
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:03,374
Yo, our monitor works better
if you don't slobber on it.

270
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:06,311
Hey, how about
that detective rollins?

271
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:08,246
She's got, like, ten things
going on,

272
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:09,981
all of them good, am I right?

273
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,349
Yeah.
I give your marriage six months.

274
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,051
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

275
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,285
Wendy and I...
we're cool like that.

276
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:17,288
And could tell her
exactly what I just told you.

277
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,224
- [Laughs] Yeah?
- Yeah.

278
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:21,059
You'd tell your fiance
that you worked

279
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:22,327
with a hot detective
from New York

280
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:25,563
that kind of blew your mind?

281
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:26,565
No.

282
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:29,133
- No.
- No.

283
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:31,870
- Come here.
- All right.

284
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:36,174
Okay, here's a list of
attendees to both conferences,

285
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:38,109
and I managed to put them
through the dmv database

286
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,310
and pull the photos.

287
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,045
Jin, I don't need to hear
about the labor.

288
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:44,015
Just show me the baby.

289
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:45,250
There.

290
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:48,987
I got 45 guys
who went to both conferences.

291
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:50,555
All right.

292
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,492
Wait. Hold up.

293
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:57,428
Whoa, whoa.
Don't touch the keys.

294
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,898
No. No.

295
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,332
Look, how many of these
I got to look at?

296
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:03,101
Don't worry about it.
Just keep looking.

297
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:04,602
I mean, like, 100 or 200,
'cause...

298
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:07,405
whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's the dude.

299
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,275
I swear to God.

300
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,915
Fyi, you're not just my fiance.

301
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,383
You're my fiance
that got in early at Facebook,

302
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:19,484
like, way early.

303
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,486
You're worth
at least $10 million.

304
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:23,421
Well, how about I get a perm
and I wear a hoodie,

305
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,189
and you can just tell everybody
I'm mark zuckerberg?

306
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:26,491
The reason
I don't wear a ring...

307
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:27,926
why can't I be a cop?

308
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:30,461
- What does your suit look like?
- Like a suit.

309
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:31,963
It has to look high end.

310
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:33,598
I have nice suits.

311
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,502
[Door opens, indistinct chatter]

312
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,375
There.

313
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:46,477
- Jeffrey Baker?
- Yes?

314
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,613
Detectives Lindsay
and halstead, Chicago p.D.

315
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,249
Apparently, there's been
some damage to your hotel room.

316
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:55,386
Would you mind coming with us
to talk about it?

317
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,455
I didn't do any damage
to my hotel room.

318
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,491
Great. You can clear all
that up down at the district.

319
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:02,193
After you.

320
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,735
So how long
have you been in town?

321
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:12,170
Five days.

322
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:14,105
Mm. From St. Louis?

323
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,741
You been to the riverwalk
at all, Jeffrey?

324
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:18,509
What does that
have to do with my hotel room?

325
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:21,412
I'll ask you, again.
You been to the riverwalk?

326
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,381
I have.

327
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:24,716
When?

328
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:26,718
[Chuckles] Forgive me,

329
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,453
but I get the sneaking suspicion

330
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:30,321
that I'm not here
about a hotel room.

331
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,056
Well, why else
would we bring you in?

332
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:33,591
I haven't the foggiest.

333
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,626
Mm.

334
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:38,062
Oh, would you like some water?

335
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:46,404
What days and times
were you at the riverwalk?

336
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:49,374
Do you get the Internet here?

337
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:51,743
'Cause there's this great video
on YouTube

338
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:53,344
by this law-school Professor,

339
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,046
and he's very articulate,

340
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:59,083
and he makes a very compelling
and convincing argument.

341
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:01,152
It's called
"don't talk to cops."

342
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,589
No offense.

343
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,694
[Chuckles]

344
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,496
You're not in St. Louis,
Jeffrey.

345
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:13,531
We've had two rape-murders here
in the last few days

346
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,066
where the women were mutilated.

347
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:17,602
Now, you're gonna answer
some questions about that.

348
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,706
Wipe that stupid smile
off your face.

349
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:28,746
I will remove the smile,
as requested,

350
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:32,216
and tell you very seriously
that you have the wrong guy.

351
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:40,491
We want the dates and times
you were at the riverwalk.

352
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,573
Get writing.

353
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,446
There's been another rape
down at the riverwalk.

354
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:02,747
Victim survived.

355
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,849
She's at Chicago med.

356
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:13,357
.

357
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:16,127
Hi, Vanessa. Ma'am.

358
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:19,597
I'm detective Lindsay,
and this is detective Dawson,

359
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,232
and we're here to try to...

360
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:23,301
I'll do whatever I can
to help you catch him.

361
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,773
All right.

362
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,208
Thank you.

363
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,844
Can you take us through
what happened?

364
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,118
I'm on the soccer team
at school,

365
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,822
so I like to get a run in
after practice,

366
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:48,292
and I cut through riverwalk
the way I do every day,

367
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,394
and out of nowhere,
this guy appears

368
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:52,296
in a brown hoodie
with a mask on.

369
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,664
Did he say anything?

370
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:58,336
Just to shut up and not scream.

371
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:00,138
He put a hand over my mouth,

372
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,741
and he dragged me
to, like, this dark area

373
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,810
underneath the stairs.

374
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,883
And then he yanked my sweats
and underwear down,

375
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:13,885
and that's when...

376
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:16,287
That... that's when he did it.

377
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,657
Okay.

378
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,828
Is there anything
that you could see on him...

379
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,764
scars, a birthmark?

380
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,266
No.

381
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:31,302
What about height and weight?

382
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:35,773
He was about you're height,
maybe a little heavier than you.

383
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:39,210
He had brown eyes,

384
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:43,314
and I saw some of his hair.
It was dirty blonde.

385
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:46,684
Well, that's great.
That's a lot more than we had.

386
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,819
Is there anything else
that you saw

387
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:51,322
that could help us identify him?

388
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:54,926
When he took his knife out...

389
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:57,261
Something kicked in.

390
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,432
We just had this self-defense
class at school,

391
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:03,901
and the instructor lady

392
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:07,972
said that if you don't remember
anything else,

393
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:10,975
you should slap, grab,
twist, and pull.

394
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:15,947
And that's what I did.

395
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:18,416
Good.

396
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:21,452
I'm glad you did.

397
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:23,921
Now, when that happened,

398
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:27,825
were you able
to scratch his face or...?

399
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:30,494
It got my thumbnail
inside his eye,

400
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,763
his right eye...

401
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:35,833
Deep.

402
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:39,904
He screamed,
and he fell off of me, and...

403
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,973
And that's when I ran.

404
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:47,345
You have been amazing.

405
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:52,016
He didn't break me.

406
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,853
I want him to know that.

407
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:01,492
He will.

408
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,664
The guy we brought in,
Jeffrey Baker...

409
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,899
what eye color does he have?
Blue.

410
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,702
Plus, he was in our custody
when this rape happened.

411
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,473
All right, kick him.

412
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:19,443
Blonde hair, brown eyes,
possible damage to the eye.

413
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:20,778
Check all clinics, hospitals,

414
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,947
see if anybody came in
for an eye injury.

415
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,583
I'll get it out to all vehicle
and foot patrol.

416
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,720
[Sighs]

417
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:31,422
You all right?

418
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:33,524
She's only 16.

419
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:36,027
Let's get him.

420
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,905
Hey, I have to head out,

421
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:50,374
but if anyone asks,
I'm on official business.

422
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:52,310
Wait. Sorry.
Can you repeat that?

423
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,779
Yes, I have to go,
but it's official business,

424
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:56,080
just in case anyone asks.
Hold on.

425
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:57,948
I got to write this down,
or I'm gonna forget it.

426
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,384
- Okay, officer burgess...
- Yeah.

427
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:02,620
Has to go,
but in case anyone asks...

428
00:22:02,622 --> 00:22:04,922
oh, that's right. Nobody cares.

429
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,492
Okay.

430
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,829
Okay, so, if the perp
was rational,

431
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,798
I mean, he'd leave town knowing
that the heat is on,

432
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,466
but there's a good chance
he's not,

433
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:18,035
so most likely he's angrier.

434
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:20,971
He's more fixated
because his needs went unmet.

435
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:23,040
He probably has a good idea
that he left DNA

436
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,742
under the victim's fingernails,

437
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:26,944
and it's only a matter of time
before he gets I.D.'D,

438
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:31,649
so he's gonna need to strike
soon while he has a chance.

439
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:32,950
All right,
hospitals and clinics,

440
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:34,852
check with foot patrol down
at riverwalk.

441
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,555
Beat the bushes on this guy.

442
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:39,657
Hey, where's burgess?

443
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,492
I haven't seen her.

444
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:44,762
- Whoa.
- Oh, sorry. My bad.

445
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,980
Hmm.

446
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:04,815
Oh, yeah, that confirms it.

447
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:07,017
Chicago cops cannot make
a good cup of coffee either.

448
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,686
[Both chuckle]

449
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:10,020
Here.

450
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,459
Thanks for helping us
work this case.

451
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:17,595
Of course.

452
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:25,703
They're tough...

453
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,807
Especially when the victims
are kids,

454
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:32,443
but, you know,
at least Vanessa's alive.

455
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:34,945
It just doesn't make any sense.

456
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:36,947
So you want the good guys
to win.

457
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:40,184
I want the bad guys
to get what's coming to them.

458
00:23:40,186 --> 00:23:41,819
Well, sometimes they do.

459
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:45,022
Do you believe in karma?

460
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:48,993
I believe in payback.

461
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:52,029
Just a little
unsolicited advice,

462
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:55,099
just because I've been there...

463
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,067
be careful

464
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:58,936
'cause payback
is the biggest bitch

465
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,005
when it consumes you.

466
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:06,110
Here, put that in there.

467
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:08,646
[Knock at door]

468

Where you been?

469
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:12,450
Well, I called
all the pharmacies

470
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:14,852
within a two-mile radius
of the attempted rape

471
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:17,021
asking if any male
with blonde hair and brown eyes

472
00:24:17,023 --> 00:24:19,023
came in
with an apparent eye injury.

473
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:20,458
The walgreen's over on superior

474
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,026
said a guy
matched that description,

475
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:24,595
bought gauze,
peroxide, sunglasses.

476
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:25,663
They needed to see a badge,

477
00:24:25,665 --> 00:24:27,164
that's why
I had to go down there.

478
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:32,470
What do you got?

479
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:35,506
He used a credit card...
Neil vance.

480
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:36,941
Jin pulled
his credit card history.

481
00:24:36,943 --> 00:24:38,742
He's been staying
at the hotel fauntleroy

482
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:40,110
the past six days.

483
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:41,946
He also has hotel charges
in New York

00:24:41,948 --> 00:24:43,180
at the same time
of the rape-murders

485
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:45,216

- That's where we met.

496
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:28,125
I was at a leadership
conference,

497
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:32,062
and you were picking out
property for a summer retreat.

498
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:33,664
Of course I was.

501
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,970
This is good.
This tells me a lot about you.

I am adding color to our story.

503

The details sell it.

undercover.

[Car door closes]

536
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,022
What are you doing here,
Jeffrey?

537
00:27:38,024 --> 00:27:39,857
I'm just out for a stroll.

538
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:42,226
Put your hands up.

539
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:43,327
Clerk said he was asking

540
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,162
what room Neil vance
was staying in.

541
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,133
Where's vance?

542
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,036
I want a lawyer.

543
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:05,416
.

544
00:28:05,418 --> 00:28:10,354
Some deviant chat room
most likely.

545
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:11,955
Baker travels
for his conventions.

546
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:13,724
Maybe vance meets him there.

547
00:28:13,726 --> 00:28:15,793
Baker's the lookout
while vance does the crime.

548
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:17,795
It's a dyad.

549
00:28:17,797 --> 00:28:21,165
Both partners plan
and commit the crime together,

550
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:22,266
but there is usually

551
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:24,702
a dominant-submissive
relationship.

552
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,104
Like the columbine killers,
the D.C. snipers,

553
00:28:27,106 --> 00:28:28,472
the menendez brothers,

554
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:31,141
those two yahoos
who blew up the Boston marathon.

555
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:34,878
Yeah, the dominant force
is psychopathic and/or sadistic.

556
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,980
The submissive partner
is depressed.

557
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:38,182
He's dependent.

558
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:40,384
The leader
is gonna be charismatic,

559
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:44,321
he's looking for a follower
to manipulate,

560
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:46,256
while the subordinate...
he's vulnerable.

561
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:48,358
He feels lost.
He needs someone to lead him.

562
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,828
Baker's the dominant,
guaranteed.

563
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,996
- Where's Baker right now?
- He's in the interview room.

564
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:55,332
He's all lawyered up.
Not for long.

565
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:57,468
Put him in the cage.

566
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,803
Yes, sergeant.

567
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:01,371
What's the cage?

568
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:21,091
With some pretty sharp
detectives from New York.

569
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:23,060
I think we got you figured out.

570
00:29:23,062 --> 00:29:24,461
You don't say.

571
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:27,798
You pull the strings.

572
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,435
Neil vance does the dirty work.

573
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:33,804
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

574
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:37,841
Take a walk.

575
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,846
Take a walk.

576
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,264
I like that face.

577
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:01,431
Where's vance?

00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:05,502
Which I've been attempting
to exercise repeated...

579
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,008
ah!

580
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,345
Ugh!

581
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,415
I can't begin to try
to understand

582
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:19,550
what goes through someone's head

583
00:30:19,552 --> 00:30:21,518
who would rape and murder
a woman,

584
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,322
so I got to ask you,
why cut off the ear?

585
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:26,390
Can you explain that to me?

586
00:30:26,392 --> 00:30:28,025
No, because I have no idea...

587
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:32,362
you both get your rocks off
on it, right?

588
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:35,465
Probably have him explain to you
in detail what it was like,

589
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:38,836
what she went through.

590
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:42,606
Instead of hearing about it...

591
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:45,909
How about I show you firsthand?

592
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:47,377
Get away from me. I have rights.

593
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:48,579
I have rights!

- Where's vance?
- No!

the right one, correct?

602
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,130
I haven't done anything!

603
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:10,000
You tell me where vance is
right now,

604
00:31:10,002 --> 00:31:13,270
or they're gonna carry you
out of here in sandwich bags.

00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:14,538
You hear?

00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,074

Come on.

00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,513
Yeah, hi. How are you?

613
00:32:29,515 --> 00:32:31,581
Okay.

614
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,366
I got the eye.

and kick it to me!

quit beating around the bush
and give me something here.

00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:48,932
[Women screaming excitedly]

712
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:05,749
What am I doing here?

713
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,585
So, like you saw in the file,

714
00:38:08,587 --> 00:38:11,288
I had been voight's c.I.,
so he knew me,

715
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:14,391
and when I was 16,
him and his wife took me in.

716
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:17,961
They saved me.

717
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:21,998
And then he pulled some strings
and got me into St. ignatius,

718
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,435
and when I got there,
I just made up who I was...

719
00:38:25,437 --> 00:38:27,003
voight's goddaughter
staying with him

720
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:30,640
while my parents were traveling.

721
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,475
So you've always been good
at undercover?

722
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:35,378
[Laughs]
If you mean lying, yeah.

723
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:39,849
I was a street kid.

724
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,788
[Laughs]

725
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:47,724
So Steph and her crew
pulled me into their clique,

726
00:38:47,726 --> 00:38:52,028
and pretty soon we were
doing everything together...

727
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:55,365
shopping, parties, and...
All of it.

728
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,802
[Sighs]

729
00:38:58,804 --> 00:39:01,538
And then somebody found out
who I really was.

730
00:39:03,562 --> 00:39:05,642
You figure out who your
real friends are pretty quick

731
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:07,444
when the word's out
that your mom's a junkie

732
00:39:07,446 --> 00:39:09,012
and your dad's in jail.

733
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,416
Whose ass did you kick first?

734
00:39:13,418 --> 00:39:14,784
[Chuckles]

735
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:16,886
Voight had to make a deal

736
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:19,089
with the director of the school
to get me in.

737
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:23,693
If I got in a fight
and threw even one punch,

738
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,795
I was out.

739
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:27,897
So I ate it.

740
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:32,869
And it still bothers me.

741
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,472
I don't know why.

742
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:37,140
Even after days like today,

743
00:39:37,142 --> 00:39:40,877
when you would think everything
would be put in perspective...

744
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,881
I don't know.

745
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:03,533
We can't.

746
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,537
Come on, let's get you home.

747
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:12,709
[Sighs]

748
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:18,047
Maybe one day.

749
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:20,984
Oh, definitely.

750
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:41,137
Hey, Justin, it's me again.

751
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:44,707
Wondering if you want
to catch a late bite.

752
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:49,179
All right, give me a call.

753
00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:00,990
[Knock at door]

754
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:03,226
[Chuckles]

755
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,665
- Hey.
- Hey.

756
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:12,135
[Breathing heavily]

757
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,970
- Are you okay?
- Um...

758
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,138
What's wrong?

759
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,208
I just, um...

760
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,477
I just, um...

761
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:22,145
I didn't want to do it,
you know?

762
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:24,180
I just... I had to.

763
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,152
Justin?

764
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:30,954
What the hell did you do?

765
00:41:30,956 --> 00:41:34,023
[Breathing heavily]
