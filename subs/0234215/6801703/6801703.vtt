- Sir, are you sure about this?
- I told you, we're going to be all right.

I understand, sir. It's just that I'm scoping
some serious sentinel activity up here.

- Link.
- Yes, sir?

I understand your reasons...

at 100 meters an hour.

- Almost 2000 meters.

00:06:31.893 --> 00:06:35.438
- What about the scans from the <i>Osiris</i>?
- They can't be accurate.

38
00:06:35.605 --> 00:06:37.523
- They may be.
- It's not possible.

39
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.151
That'd mean there are
a quarter-million sentinels.

That's right, I am. But we well know
that the reason most of us are here...

for disobedience.

00:16:45.923 --> 00:16:50.427
I spoke to the other captains. I wanted to
offer you a chance to explain your actions.

I wasn't aware that my actions
required any explanation.

You were given an order
to return to Zion.

- You asked for one ship to remain behind.

but I needed to recharge my ship.

of your duty.

I don't care about oracles
or prophecies or messiahs!

00:17:13.367 --> 00:17:16.787
I care about one thing: Stopping that
army from destroying this city.

168
00:17:16.954 --> 00:17:19.790
To do that I need soldiers
to obey my orders.

With all due respect, commander,
there is only one way to save our city.

- They have their reasons...

492

...but usually a program chooses exile
when it faces deletion.

493
00:47:42.027 --> 00:47:45.947
- And why would a program be deleted?
- Maybe it breaks down.

Maybe a better program is created
to replace it. Happens all the time.

is a means, it is not an end.

676
01:05:35.099 --> 01:05:40.855
And so to look for him is to be
looking for a means to do...

677
01:05:41.021 --> 01:05:44.191
- ...what?
- You know the answer to that question.

678

But do you?

679
01:05:46.694 --> 01:05:49.029
You think you do, but you do not.

680
01:05:49.196 --> 01:05:52.408
You are here
because you were sent here.

681
01:05:52.575 --> 01:05:55.703
You were told to come here,
and then you obeyed.

682
01:05:56.871 --> 01:05:59.206
It is, of course, the way of all things.

683
01:05:59.373 --> 01:06:02.042
You see, there is only one constant...

684
01:06:02.209 --> 01:06:06.380
...one universal. It is the only real truth.

- Cause and effect.
- Everything begins with choice.

No. Wrong.

689
01:06:17.141 --> 01:06:21.729
Choice is an illusion created
between those with power...

690

So obvious, so bourgeois, so boring.
But wait.

...each line of the program creating
a new effect, just like...

700

You can see it, Neo, yes?

704
01:07:18.536 --> 01:07:21.121
She does not understand why.

705
01:07:21.372 --> 01:07:23.791
Is it the wine? No.

706
01:07:23.958 --> 01:07:26.335
What is it then? What is the reason?

707
01:07:26.961 --> 01:07:29.296
And soon it does not matter.

708
01:07:29.463 --> 01:07:32.466
Soon the why and the reason are gone...

709
01:07:33.425 --> 01:07:38.973
...and all that matters is the feeling itself.

710
01:07:39.431 --> 01:07:42.518
And this is the nature of the universe.

711
01:07:42.685 --> 01:07:45.229
We struggle against it,
we fight to deny it...

712
01:07:45.396 --> 01:07:47.982
...but it is, of course, pretense.
It is a lie.

713

Beneath our poised appearance...

714
01:07:52.319 --> 01:07:57.616

...out of control.

716
01:08:08.711 --> 01:08:13.591
Causality. There is no escape from it.
We are forever slaves to it.

717
01:08:14.008 --> 01:08:19.471
Our only hope, our only peace,
is to understand it, to understand the why.

718
01:08:19.638 --> 01:08:23.058
"Why" is what separates us from them...

...you from me.

720
01:08:25.686 --> 01:08:29.440
"Why" is the only real source of power.
Without it, you are powerless.

You will know which door.
Hurry, Neo.

1034
01:49:33.985 --> 01:49:37.155
Trinity, I got some serious activity
headed your way.

1035
01:50:29.457 --> 01:50:30.834
Hello, Neo.

1036
01:50:31.376 --> 01:50:35.171
- Who are you?
- I am the Architect.

1037
01:50:35.338 --> 01:50:38.967
I created the Matrix.
I've been waiting for you.

1038
01:50:39.217 --> 01:50:43.388
You have many questions. Though the
process has altered your consciousness...

1039
01:50:43.555 --> 01:50:45.557
...you remain irrevocably human.

1040
01:50:45.723 --> 01:50:49.310
Ergo, some of my answers you will
understand and some you will not.

1041
01:50:49.727 --> 01:50:53.773
Concordantly, while your first question
may be the most pertinent...

1042
01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:57.652
...you may or may not realize
it is also the most irrelevant.

1043
01:50:58.528 --> 01:51:00.155
Why am I here?

1044
01:51:00.321 --> 01:51:04.242
Your life is the sum of a remainder
of an unbalanced equation...

1045
01:51:04.409 --> 01:51:06.744
...inherent to the programming
of the Matrix.

1046
01:51:06.911 --> 01:51:10.999
You are the eventuality of an anomaly,
which despite my sincerest efforts...

1047
01:51:11.166 --> 01:51:14.002
...I've been unable to eliminate
from what is otherwise...

1048
01:51:14.169 --> 01:51:18.631
...a harmony of mathematical precision.

1049
01:51:18.965 --> 01:51:21.301
While it remains a burden
assiduously avoided...

1050
01:51:21.467 --> 01:51:25.930
...it is not unexpected and thus
not beyond a measure of control...

1051
01:51:26.097 --> 01:51:30.059
...which has led you, inexorably...

1052
01:51:31.019 --> 01:51:32.270
...here.

1053
01:51:32.437 --> 01:51:36.524
- You haven't answered my question.
- Quite right.

1054
01:51:36.691 --> 01:51:40.486
Interesting.
That was quicker than the others.

1055
01:51:40.653 --> 01:51:43.281
NEOS: <i>Others? How many?
What others?</i>

1056
01:51:43.448 --> 01:51:45.950
The Matrix is older than you know.

1057
01:51:46.117 --> 01:51:50.121
I count from the emergence of one integral
anomaly to the emergence of the next.

1058
01:51:50.288 --> 01:51:52.540
In which case, this is the sixth version.

1059
01:51:52.707 --> 01:51:55.168
NEOS: <i>Five before me?
He's lying. Bullshit.</i>

1060
01:51:55.335 --> 01:51:58.880
<i>There are only two possible explanations.
There were five before me.</i>

1061
01:51:59.047 --> 01:52:00.340
<i>Either no one told me...</i>

1062
01:52:01.591 --> 01:52:05.595
- ...or no one knows.
- Precisely.

1063
01:52:05.762 --> 01:52:09.057
As you are undoubtedly gathering,
the anomaly is systemic...

1064
01:52:09.224 --> 01:52:12.644
...creating fluctuations in even
the most simplistic equations.

1065
01:52:12.810 --> 01:52:16.064
<i>You can't control me!
I'm gonna smash you to bits!</i>

1066
01:52:16.231 --> 01:52:18.024
<i>I'm gonna fucking kill you!</i>

1067
01:52:18.191 --> 01:52:21.361
<i>You can't make me do anything.
You old, white prick!</i>

1068
01:52:23.655 --> 01:52:25.156
Choice.

1069
01:52:25.323 --> 01:52:27.158
The problem is choice.

1070
01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:28.743
[ELEVATOR BELL RINGS]

1071
01:52:49.389 --> 01:52:53.017
The first Matrix I designed
was naturally perfect, a work of art.

1072
01:52:53.184 --> 01:52:55.019
Flawless, sublime.

1073
01:52:55.186 --> 01:52:58.690
A triumph equaled only
by its monumental failure.

1074
01:52:59.357 --> 01:53:01.776
The inevitability of its doom
is apparent now...

1075
01:53:01.943 --> 01:53:05.280
...as a consequence of the imperfection
inherent in every human.

1076
01:53:05.446 --> 01:53:08.408
Thus, I redesigned it
based on your history...

1077
01:53:08.574 --> 01:53:12.578
...to more accurately reflect
the varying grotesqueries of your nature.

1078
01:53:13.288 --> 01:53:17.041
However, I was again frustrated
by failure.

1079
01:53:18.501 --> 01:53:21.129
I have come to understand
that the answer eluded me...

1080
01:53:21.296 --> 01:53:23.339
...because it required a lesser mind.

1081
01:53:23.506 --> 01:53:29.470
Or perhaps, a mind less bound
by the parameters of perfection.

1082
01:53:29.887 --> 01:53:34.309
Thus, the answer was stumbled upon
by another, an intuitive program...

1083
01:53:34.475 --> 01:53:39.272
...initially created to investigate
certain aspects of the human psyche.

1084
01:53:39.439 --> 01:53:45.403
If I am the father of the Matrix,
she would undoubtedly be its mother.

1085
01:53:46.029 --> 01:53:48.323
- The Oracle.
- Please.

1086
01:53:49.032 --> 01:53:53.036
As I was saying, she stumbled upon a
solution whereby 99 percent of subjects...

1087
01:53:53.202 --> 01:53:56.080
...accepted the program, as long as they
were given a choice...

1088
01:53:56.247 --> 01:54:00.376
...even if they were only aware
of the choice at a near unconscious level.

1089
01:54:00.543 --> 01:54:03.963
While this answer functioned,
it was fundamentally flawed...

1090
01:54:04.130 --> 01:54:08.134
...thus creating the otherwise
contradictory systemic anomaly...

1091
01:54:08.301 --> 01:54:11.012
...that, if left unchecked,
might threaten the system.

1092
01:54:11.387 --> 01:54:15.516
Ergo, those that refused the program,
while a minority, if unchecked...

1093
01:54:15.683 --> 01:54:19.771
...would constitute
an escalating probability of disaster.

1094
01:54:19.937 --> 01:54:21.731
This is about Zion.

1095
01:54:22.190 --> 01:54:25.860
You are here because Zion
is about to be destroyed.

1096
01:54:26.027 --> 01:54:30.448
Its every living inhabitant terminated,
its entire existence eradicated.

1097
01:54:30.740 --> 01:54:31.783
Bullshit.

1098
01:54:31.949 --> 01:54:35.119
Denial is the most predictable
of all human responses.

1099
01:54:35.328 --> 01:54:41.793
But rest assured, this will be
the sixth time we have destroyed it...

1100
01:54:41.959 --> 01:54:45.963
...and we have become
exceedingly efficient at it.

1101
01:54:58.684 --> 01:54:59.977
The function of the One...

1102
01:55:00.144 --> 01:55:04.816
...is now to return to the source, allowing
a dissemination of the code you carry...

1103
01:55:04.982 --> 01:55:06.692
...reinserting the prime program.

1104
01:55:07.276 --> 01:55:11.280
After which you will be required to select
from the Matrix 23 individuals...

1105
01:55:11.447 --> 01:55:14.700
...sixteen female, seven male,
to rebuild Zion.

1106
01:55:14.867 --> 01:55:19.414
Failure to comply with this process
will result in a cataclysmic system crash...

1107
01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:21.916
...killing everyone connected
to the Matrix...

1108
01:55:22.083 --> 01:55:24.669
...which, coupled with the
extermination of Zion...

1109
01:55:24.836 --> 01:55:29.048
...will result in the extinction
of the entire human race.

1110
01:55:29.382 --> 01:55:33.469
You won't let it happen. You can't.
You need human beings to survive.

1111
01:55:34.262 --> 01:55:37.890
There are levels of survival
we are prepared to accept.

1112
01:55:38.057 --> 01:55:40.852
The relevant issue is
whether or not you are ready...

1113
01:55:41.018 --> 01:55:44.605
...to accept the responsibility for the death
of every human being in this world.

1114
01:55:51.070 --> 01:55:53.614
It is interesting reading your reactions.

1115
01:55:54.657 --> 01:55:58.494
Your five predecessors were, by design,
based on a similar predication...

1116
01:55:58.661 --> 01:56:03.124
...a contingent affirmation that was meant
to create a profound attachment...

1117
01:56:03.291 --> 01:56:06.878
...to the rest of your species,
facilitating the function of the One.

1118
01:56:07.044 --> 01:56:09.380
While the others experience this
in a general way...

1119
01:56:09.547 --> 01:56:12.508
...your experience is far more specific...

1120
01:56:12.842 --> 01:56:15.720
...vis-à-vis love.

No.

1124
01:56:27.106 --> 01:56:31.235
Which brings us at last to the moment
of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw...

1125
01:56:31.402 --> 01:56:34.489
...is ultimately expressed
and the anomaly revealed...

1126
01:56:34.655 --> 01:56:38.659
...as both beginning and end.

1127
01:56:38.826 --> 01:56:40.495
There are two doors.

The door to your right leads to the source
and the salvation of Zion.

01:56:44.457 --> 01:56:50.755

1184
02:03:29.904 --> 02:03:32.114
We have to get out of here. Now.

1185
02:04:08.817 --> 02:04:10.694
I have dreamed a dream...

1186
02:04:13.739 --> 02:04:17.117
...but now that dream
has gone from me.

1187
02:04:28.170 --> 02:04:30.422
Here they come.

1188
02:04:30.673 --> 02:04:32.383
Let's go, Morpheus.

1189
02:04:33.801 --> 02:04:36.845
- We won't make it.
- We have to try.

1190
02:04:44.561 --> 02:04:47.564
- Come on!
- Something's different.

1191
02:04:47.731 --> 02:04:49.733
What?

1192
02:04:50.401 --> 02:04:51.902
I can feel them.

1193
02:05:14.842 --> 02:05:16.427
Neo!

1194
02:05:22.599 --> 02:05:26.186
- What happened?
- I don't know.

[RUMBLING]

1196
02:05:31.442 --> 02:05:33.360
It's the <i>Hammer.</i>

WOMAN:
He's in some kind of coma...

1198
02:05:47.916 --> 02:05:50.169
...but his vitals are stable.

1199
02:05:51.378 --> 02:05:53.297
What about you?

1200
02:05:53.464 --> 02:05:55.591
I'm fine.

1201
02:05:55.758 --> 02:05:58.135
You could use some rest.

1202
02:05:58.302 --> 02:06:00.137
No, I'm gonna stay with him.

1203
02:06:07.227 --> 02:06:09.855
Lock was right.
He guessed that the machines...

1204
02:06:10.022 --> 02:06:12.900
...would cut off the mainlines
in and out of Zion.

1205
02:06:13.067 --> 02:06:15.819
He thought a counterattack
might surprise them.

1206
02:06:16.070 --> 02:06:19.490
It sounded good.
I figured we had a shot...

1207
02:06:19.823 --> 02:06:22.367
...until someone screwed it up.

1208
02:06:22.534 --> 02:06:25.162
An EMP was triggered before
we got in position.

1209
02:06:25.329 --> 02:06:27.206
Five ships were instantly downed.

MAN:
When the machines broke through...

1211
02:06:29.333 --> 02:06:32.544
...it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.

1212
02:06:32.711 --> 02:06:35.547
Was it an accident?
Some sort of malfunction?

1213
02:06:35.714 --> 02:06:38.175
- No one knows.
- Someone does.

1214
02:06:38.342 --> 02:06:40.094
Who?

1215
02:06:40.260 --> 02:06:43.972
Once the machines were done with us,
they started digging again.

1216
02:06:44.139 --> 02:06:46.433
We made a quick pass
to look for survivors.

1217
02:06:46.642 --> 02:06:47.726
You found one?

1218
02:06:49.478 --> 02:06:51.188
Only one.

I see death.</i>

Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

We missed you.
