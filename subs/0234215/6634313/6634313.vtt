1
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.135
See you tomorrow.

2
00:01:48.446 --> 00:01:49.488
Oh, my god.

3
00:02:12.136 --> 00:02:13.638
I'm in.

4
00:04:06.751 --> 00:04:08.544
We're almost there.

5
00:04:08.711 --> 00:04:10.350
Sir, are you sure about this?

6
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.175
I told you, we're going
to be all right.

7
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.759
I understand, sir.
It's just that...

8
00:04:14.926 --> 00:04:18.304
I'm scoping some serious
sentinel activity up here.

9
00:04:56.467 --> 00:04:58.886
- Link.
- Yes, sir?

10
00:04:59.053 --> 00:05:02.330
Given your situation, I can't say
I fully understand your reasons

11
00:05:02.331 --> 00:05:05.017
for volunteering to
operate on board my ship.

12
00:05:05.184 --> 00:05:07.600
However, if you wish
to continue to do so,

13
00:05:07.601 --> 00:05:09.350
I must ask you to do one thing.

14
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.190
What's that, sir?

15
00:05:11.941 --> 00:05:13.234
To trust me.

16
00:05:13.401 --> 00:05:15.361
Yes, sir. I will, sir.

17
00:05:17.405 --> 00:05:20.575
- I mean, I do, sir.
- I hope so.

18
00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:22.880
Now re-patch the main
AC to the hard drives

19
00:05:22.881 --> 00:05:24.150
and stand by to broadcast.

20
00:05:24.287 --> 00:05:25.371
Yes, sir.

21
00:05:34.213 --> 00:05:36.465
Still can't sleep?

22
00:05:38.426 --> 00:05:39.802
You wanna talk?

23
00:05:42.138 --> 00:05:44.515
They're just dreams.

24
00:05:46.851 --> 00:05:49.228
If you're afraid of something...

25
00:05:49.395 --> 00:05:51.230
I just wish...

26
00:05:51.898 --> 00:05:54.150
I wish I knew what
I'm supposed to do.

27
00:05:54.317 --> 00:05:56.152
That's all.

28
00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:58.654
I just wish I knew.

29
00:05:58.821 --> 00:06:03.075
She's going to call. Don't worry.

30
00:06:03.242 --> 00:06:04.285
Here you are.

31
00:06:04.452 --> 00:06:07.914
- Are we ready to go?
- We're already late.

32
00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.710
These geotherms confirm the last
transmission of the Osiris.

33
00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:15.129
The machines are digging.

34
00:06:16.797 --> 00:06:19.360
They're boring from the surface
straight down to Zion.

35
00:06:19.361 --> 00:06:20.361
Mother...

36
00:06:20.362 --> 00:06:22.300
They'll avoid the entire
perimeter defence.

37
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.513
How fast are they moving?

38
00:06:23.679 --> 00:06:26.680
Control estimates their descent
at 100 metres an hour.

39
00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:27.691
Shit.

40
00:06:27.692 --> 00:06:30.000
- How deep are they?
- Almost 2000 metres.

41
00:06:30.002 --> 00:06:31.650
What about the scans
from the Osiris?

42
00:06:31.651 --> 00:06:32.851
They can't be accurate.

43
00:06:33.564 --> 00:06:34.950
- They may be.
- What?

44
00:06:34.951 --> 00:06:35.951
It's not possible.

45
00:06:35.952 --> 00:06:38.110
That'd mean there are a quarter
million sentinels out there.

46
00:06:38.277 --> 00:06:39.779
- That's right.
- That can't be.

47
00:06:39.946 --> 00:06:41.614
Why not?

48
00:06:41.781 --> 00:06:45.535
A sentinel for every man,
woman and child in Zion.

49
00:06:46.494 --> 00:06:50.456
That sounds exactly like the
thinking of a machine to me.

50
00:06:50.623 --> 00:06:52.792
Morpheus, glad you could join us.

51
00:06:53.292 --> 00:06:54.460
Niobe.

52
00:06:55.837 --> 00:06:58.145
My apologies to all.

53
00:06:58.446 --> 00:07:01.090
As you are undoubtedly aware it
has become increasingly difficult

54
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.277
to locate a secure
broadcast position.

55
00:07:03.344 --> 00:07:04.710
Squiddies got all our best spots.

56
00:07:04.711 --> 00:07:06.075
Mainlines are crawling with them.

57
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.200
And if Niobe's right,

58
00:07:07.201 --> 00:07:10.125
in 72 hours there's going to
be a quarter-million more.

59
00:07:10.226 --> 00:07:11.652
What are we going to do about it?

60
00:07:11.655 --> 00:07:12.855
We're going to do
what Commander Lock

61
00:07:12.856 --> 00:07:13.856
ordered us to do.

62
00:07:14.146 --> 00:07:16.732
We'll evacuate broadcast
level, return to Zion.

63
00:07:16.899 --> 00:07:18.375
And does the Commander have a plan

64
00:07:18.376 --> 00:07:21.300
for stopping 250,000 sentinels?

65
00:07:22.196 --> 00:07:24.866
A strategy is still
being formulated.

66
00:07:25.032 --> 00:07:26.701
I'm sure it is.

67
00:07:41.716 --> 00:07:43.672
What do you think we
should do, Morpheus?

68
00:07:43.673 --> 00:07:45.202
I think we should
proceed as ordered.

69
00:07:45.203 --> 00:07:46.203
What is it?

70
00:07:46.204 --> 00:07:47.407
- However...
- I don't know.

71
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.224
I must ask one of you for help.

72
00:07:50.391 --> 00:07:52.550
Some of you believe as I believe.

73
00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.300
Some of you do not.

74
00:07:54.672 --> 00:07:55.960
But those of you that do,

75
00:07:55.961 --> 00:07:58.330
know we are nearing the
end of our struggle.

76
00:07:58.983 --> 00:08:00.870
The prophecy will
be fulfilled soon,

77
00:08:00.871 --> 00:08:02.640
but before it can be...

78
00:08:03.404 --> 00:08:06.741
the Oracle must be consulted.

79
00:08:14.665 --> 00:08:16.918
If we return and recharge now

80
00:08:17.084 --> 00:08:19.262
we can be back with
inside 36 hours.

81
00:08:19.462 --> 00:08:21.320
Well before the machines
have reached this depth.

82
00:08:21.321 --> 00:08:22.882
Do you understand
what you're asking?

83
00:08:23.049 --> 00:08:26.300
I am asking that one ship
remain here in our place

84
00:08:26.302 --> 00:08:29.190
just in case the Oracle
should attempt to contact us.

85
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.200
Bullshit.

86
00:08:30.201 --> 00:08:32.120
You're asking for one of us
to disobey a direct order.

87
00:08:32.125 --> 00:08:33.590
That's right, I am.

88
00:08:34.391 --> 00:08:36.600
But we well know that the
reason most of us are here

89
00:08:36.938 --> 00:08:39.665
is because of our affinity
for disobedience.

90
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:41.551
And what happens when
you get back to Zion

91
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.660
and the commander throws
you in the stockade?

92
00:08:44.403 --> 00:08:45.613
He won't.

93
00:08:46.739 --> 00:08:49.951
Goddamn it, Morpheus, you
ain't never going to change.

94
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.412
Shit, I'll do it just to see
what Deadbolt does to you.

95
00:08:53.579 --> 00:08:55.122
You got 36 hours.

96
00:08:57.917 --> 00:08:59.752
I'm looking for Neo.

97
00:08:59.919 --> 00:09:03.297
- Never heard of him.
- I have something for him.

98
00:09:04.507 --> 00:09:06.717
A gift.

99
00:09:06.926 --> 00:09:09.804
You see, he set me free.

100
00:09:12.098 --> 00:09:14.475
Fine, whatever. Now piss off.

101
00:09:15.017 --> 00:09:16.040
Who was that?

102
00:09:16.041 --> 00:09:17.741
How did you know someone was here?

103
00:09:18.229 --> 00:09:19.689
He gave you this.

104
00:09:25.444 --> 00:09:26.863
He said you set him free.

105
00:09:28.823 --> 00:09:31.158
Is everything all right, sir?

106
00:09:31.784 --> 00:09:34.161
The meeting is over.
Retreat to your exits.

107
00:09:34.328 --> 00:09:36.539
- Agents are coming.
- Agents?

108
00:09:36.998 --> 00:09:38.374
Go.

109
00:09:48.176 --> 00:09:49.260
Hiya, fellas.

110
00:09:49.427 --> 00:09:50.553
- It's him.
- The anomaly.

111
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.971
- Do we proceed?
- Yes.

112
00:09:52.138 --> 00:09:54.640
- He is still...
- Only human.

113
00:10:01.522 --> 00:10:03.065
Upgrades.

114
00:10:57.995 --> 00:11:00.540
- That went as expected.
- Yes.

115
00:11:00.706 --> 00:11:03.376
It's happening exactly as before.

116
00:11:03.543 --> 00:11:06.212
Well, not exactly.

117
00:11:09.924 --> 00:11:12.210
- What happened back there, Link?
- I can't figure it out, sir.

118
00:11:12.218 --> 00:11:13.886
Agents just came out of nowhere.

119
00:11:14.053 --> 00:11:17.056
And then the code got all weird.
Encryption I've never seen.

120
00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.140
Is Neo okay?

121
00:11:18.141 --> 00:11:20.226
Okay? Shit, Morpheus you
should've seen him.

122
00:11:20.309 --> 00:11:21.727
Where is he now?

123
00:11:23.187 --> 00:11:24.939
He's doing his Superman thing.

124
00:12:14.906 --> 00:12:16.365
Where are you?

125
00:12:21.037 --> 00:12:22.714
This is the Nebuchadnezzar
on approach,

126
00:12:22.715 --> 00:12:24.480
requesting access through Gate 3.

127
00:12:28.669 --> 00:12:30.832
Nebuchadnezzar, this
is Zion Control.

128
00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:33.033
Maintain present
velocity and stand by.

129
00:12:33.299 --> 00:12:34.800
Roger that, Control.

130
00:12:34.967 --> 00:12:36.220
This is Zion Control,

131
00:12:36.221 --> 00:12:38.535
requesting immediate stand
down of arms at Gate 3.

132
00:12:39.263 --> 00:12:41.375
We have the Nebuchadnezzar
on approach.

133
00:12:41.676 --> 00:12:42.676
Let's open her up.

134
00:12:48.064 --> 00:12:51.150
Nebuchadnezzar, you are clear
through Gate 3 to Bay 7.

135
00:12:51.151 --> 00:12:52.860
Roger that, Control.

136
00:12:59.992 --> 00:13:03.200
Door's open, bed's
made. Welcome home.

137
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:05.998
No place like it.

138
00:13:20.179 --> 00:13:21.550
Roger that, Control.

139
00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:24.000
Zion Control, stand by
for Gate 3 lockdown.

140
00:14:13.399 --> 00:14:15.818
The Nebuchadnezzar is down. Bay 7.

141
00:14:15.985 --> 00:14:17.153
Understood.

142
00:14:27.121 --> 00:14:28.414
Captain Mifune.

143
00:14:29.499 --> 00:14:30.666
Captain Morpheus.

144
00:14:30.833 --> 00:14:33.669
Are you here to escort me
to the stockade, captain?

145
00:14:33.836 --> 00:14:37.256
- I'm just here to keep the peace.
- Commander Lock demands...

146
00:14:38.508 --> 00:14:41.677
Requests your immediate
counsel, sir.

147
00:14:42.595 --> 00:14:44.430
- Link.
- Sir?

148
00:14:44.597 --> 00:14:47.183
I want the ship ready to go
as soon as humanly possible.

149
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:48.893
Understood, sir.

150
00:14:56.067 --> 00:14:58.800
- What is it between them?
- Morpheus and Lock?

151
00:14:59.612 --> 00:15:01.781
- Niobe.
- Captain Niobe?

152
00:15:01.948 --> 00:15:05.159
She used to be with Morpheus.
Now she's with Lock.

153
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:07.995
What happened?

154
00:15:08.204 --> 00:15:11.624
Morpheus went to the Oracle.
After that, everything changed.

155
00:15:11.791 --> 00:15:14.460
Yeah, she can do that.

156
00:15:14.627 --> 00:15:15.795
Neo.

157
00:15:16.796 --> 00:15:19.674
- Oh, no.
- How does he always know?

158
00:15:19.841 --> 00:15:21.801
Doesn't he have
anything better to do?

159
00:15:21.968 --> 00:15:24.679
You know what they say
about the life you save.

160
00:15:24.846 --> 00:15:26.639
I didn't save his life.

161
00:15:28.808 --> 00:15:30.184
Hiya, Neo.

162
00:15:31.352 --> 00:15:33.980
- Trinity, Link.
- Hey.

163
00:15:34.146 --> 00:15:37.817
- It's great to have you back.
- Thanks. It's good to be back.

164
00:15:37.984 --> 00:15:40.736
- Can I carry that for you, Neo?
- No, I can carry my own bag.

165
00:15:40.903 --> 00:15:42.572
- Trinity?
- I'm fine.

166
00:15:43.531 --> 00:15:46.409
- You can carry these.
- Yeah, sure, Link.

167
00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.350
Hey, you know,

168
00:15:53.351 --> 00:15:56.000
next year I'm old enough
to join a crew, right?

169
00:15:56.002 --> 00:15:58.900
I've been thinking a lot about
it and I've made my decision.

170
00:15:58.921 --> 00:16:00.381
Let me guess.

171
00:16:00.882 --> 00:16:02.842
I want to join the Nebuchadnezzar.

172
00:16:03.843 --> 00:16:06.250
I know Morpheus hasn't filled
the other crew positions

173
00:16:06.251 --> 00:16:07.251
except for you, Link.

174
00:16:07.555 --> 00:16:08.931
I'm sure he has his reasons,

175
00:16:08.998 --> 00:16:12.435
but the more I think about it, the
more I think it's meant to be.

176
00:16:12.602 --> 00:16:14.145
You know, it's fate.

177
00:16:14.312 --> 00:16:16.155
I mean, you're the
reason I'm here, Neo.

178
00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.566
I told you, Kid, you found
me, I didn't find you.

179
00:16:18.733 --> 00:16:21.277
I know, but you got
me out. You saved me.

180
00:16:22.403 --> 00:16:24.030
You saved yourself.

181
00:16:40.338 --> 00:16:43.633
- Morpheus.
- Commander Lock.

182
00:16:43.883 --> 00:16:45.384
I've spoken to the other captains,

183
00:16:45.551 --> 00:16:48.387
and I wanted to offer you the
chance to explain your actions.

184
00:16:48.554 --> 00:16:51.624
I wasn't aware that my actions
required any explanation.

185
00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:54.267
You were given a direct
order to return to Zion.

186
00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.300
I did.

187
00:16:55.301 --> 00:16:56.896
But you asked for one
ship to remain behind.

188
00:16:57.063 --> 00:16:59.732
I would have stayed, but I
needed to recharge my ship.

189
00:16:59.899 --> 00:17:02.910
So you admit to a direct
contravention of your duty.

190
00:17:03.077 --> 00:17:05.075
Commander, we need a
presence inside the Matrix

191
00:17:05.076 --> 00:17:06.470
to await contact from the Oracle.

192
00:17:06.474 --> 00:17:08.324
I don't want to hear that shit.

193
00:17:08.491 --> 00:17:11.160
I don't care about oracles
or prophecies or messiahs.

194
00:17:11.327 --> 00:17:12.677
I care about one thing:

195
00:17:12.678 --> 00:17:14.678
Stopping that army from
destroying this city.

196
00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.750
And to do that I need
soldiers to obey my orders.

197
00:17:17.917 --> 00:17:19.950
With all due respect, Commander,

198
00:17:20.051 --> 00:17:22.300
there is only one way
to save our city.

199
00:17:22.672 --> 00:17:24.090
How?

200
00:17:24.257 --> 00:17:27.051
- Neo.
- Goddamn it, Morpheus.

201
00:17:27.218 --> 00:17:29.846
Not everyone believes
what you believe.

202
00:17:30.012 --> 00:17:32.098
My beliefs do not require them to.

203
00:17:40.273 --> 00:17:41.950
There's a gathering tonight.

204
00:17:41.951 --> 00:17:44.351
Everyone's talking. A lot
of people are scared.

205
00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.113
No one can remember the last
time so many ships were docked.

206
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.615
Something's happening,
isn't it? Something big?

207
00:17:49.657 --> 00:17:53.578
Hey. We're not allowed to say
anything, so stop asking.

208
00:17:58.875 --> 00:18:02.003
Goddamn, it's good to be home.

209
00:18:15.016 --> 00:18:16.635
I'm going to recommend
to the Council

210
00:18:16.636 --> 00:18:18.190
that you be removed from duty.

211
00:18:18.244 --> 00:18:20.579
That is, of course, your
prerogative, Commander.

212
00:18:20.746 --> 00:18:22.311
If it were up to me, Captain,

213
00:18:22.312 --> 00:18:24.520
you wouldn't set foot on a ship
for the rest of your life.

214
00:18:24.592 --> 00:18:28.087
Then I am grateful that
it is not up to you.

215
00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:36.429
- Councillor Hamann.
- Commander.

216
00:18:37.096 --> 00:18:39.807
- Captain.
- Councillor.

217
00:18:39.974 --> 00:18:42.070
Council's asked me
to speak tonight,

218
00:18:42.071 --> 00:18:43.071
at the temple gathering.

219
00:18:43.519 --> 00:18:44.815
The presence of the fleet

220
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.607
and the persistence of
rumours must be addressed.

221
00:18:47.773 --> 00:18:50.276
The people must be told
what is happening.

222
00:18:50.443 --> 00:18:52.153
Of course, councillor.

223
00:18:52.862 --> 00:18:56.075
But might I advise a
level of discretion

224
00:18:56.076 --> 00:18:57.850
concerning specific details.

225
00:18:58.284 --> 00:19:01.287
- We do not wish to start a panic.
- Quite right.

226
00:19:01.454 --> 00:19:04.540
A panic is not what anyone wants.

227
00:19:04.707 --> 00:19:08.444
What about you, captain?
What would you advise?

228
00:19:10.463 --> 00:19:15.217
The truth. No one will panic,
because there is nothing to fear.

229
00:19:15.384 --> 00:19:17.511
That army will never
reach the gates of Zion.

230
00:19:18.304 --> 00:19:19.995
What makes you so sure?

231
00:19:19.996 --> 00:19:21.996
Consider what we have
seen, councillor.

232
00:19:22.058 --> 00:19:23.935
Consider that in the
past six months

233
00:19:24.101 --> 00:19:26.145
we have freed more minds
than in six years.

234
00:19:26.312 --> 00:19:29.315
This attack is an
act of desperation.

235
00:19:29.482 --> 00:19:32.035
I believe very soon the
prophecy will be fulfilled

236
00:19:32.036 --> 00:19:33.300
and this war will end.

237
00:19:35.196 --> 00:19:37.323
I hope you're right, captain.

238
00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:40.201
I do not believe it to be a
matter of hope, councillor.

239
00:19:40.368 --> 00:19:42.954
It is simply a matter of time.

240
00:19:45.122 --> 00:19:46.582
My stop.

241
00:19:46.749 --> 00:19:48.167
See you soon.

242
00:19:48.334 --> 00:19:49.794
Hopefully not too soon.

243
00:19:49.961 --> 00:19:53.130
Let's go, kid. These
two got things to do.

244
00:20:02.556 --> 00:20:04.308
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

245
00:20:04.475 --> 00:20:06.894
I am if you're thinking this
elevator's too damn slow.

246
00:20:07.061 --> 00:20:10.398
- How long to recharge the Neb?
- 24, maybe 30 hours.

247
00:20:10.564 --> 00:20:14.777
Some people go their entire lives
without hearing news that good.

248
00:20:39.218 --> 00:20:43.556
Neo, please. I have a son,
Jacob, aboard the Gnosis.

249
00:20:43.723 --> 00:20:47.000
- Please, watch over him.
- I'll try.

250
00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.478
I have a daughter on the Icarus.

251
00:20:50.271 --> 00:20:51.564
No, wait.

252
00:20:51.731 --> 00:20:54.233
It's all right. They need you.

253
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.652
- I need you.
- I know.

254
00:20:57.194 --> 00:20:59.488
There's time.

255
00:21:04.452 --> 00:21:06.579
Where's my puss-?

256
00:21:06.746 --> 00:21:09.081
- Hey.
- Uncle Link.

257
00:21:09.248 --> 00:21:10.875
God.

258
00:21:11.042 --> 00:21:13.002
Uncle Link.

259
00:21:13.169 --> 00:21:16.756
Oh, my god. You're so huge.

260
00:21:16.922 --> 00:21:19.091
- You should be picking me up.
- No.

261
00:21:19.258 --> 00:21:20.801
- Yeah.
- Okay.

262
00:21:20.968 --> 00:21:22.678
Okay? All right.

263
00:21:22.845 --> 00:21:25.890
Now, we're going to have to
work together here, okay?

264
00:21:26.057 --> 00:21:28.267
One, two, three, lift.

265
00:21:28.434 --> 00:21:31.604
Oh, my god. What are
you feeding these two?

266
00:21:31.771 --> 00:21:34.482
Come on, kids. It's time to go.

267
00:21:36.275 --> 00:21:37.610
- Hey, Cas.
- Hey.

268
00:21:38.152 --> 00:21:40.696
- Good to have you home, Link.
- Good to be home.

269
00:21:40.863 --> 00:21:42.698
You be careful with her.

270
00:21:42.865 --> 00:21:45.660
Don't worry about me, he's the
one that's going to get it.

271
00:21:47.495 --> 00:21:49.872
Out the door. Both of you, march.

272
00:21:50.039 --> 00:21:52.083
- Bye.
- Bye.

273
00:21:58.464 --> 00:22:00.007
I'm going to get what?

274
00:22:01.175 --> 00:22:03.510
Every ship out there
has been home two,

275
00:22:03.511 --> 00:22:05.513
even three times more
than the Nebuchadnezzar.

276
00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:09.550
Come on, Zee. I thought
we were past this.

277
00:22:09.558 --> 00:22:12.180
We'll get past this when you
start operating another ship.

278
00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.200
I can't do that.

279
00:22:13.201 --> 00:22:14.647
- Why?
- You know why.

280
00:22:14.814 --> 00:22:16.355
If Dozer knew how I felt,

281
00:22:16.356 --> 00:22:17.856
he wouldn't have asked
you to do this.

282
00:22:18.693 --> 00:22:21.237
Maybe. But it's too late now.

283
00:22:21.404 --> 00:22:24.031
I made a promise, and some
promises can't be unmade.

284
00:22:24.198 --> 00:22:26.909
- It's not fair.
- Nobody said it was going to be.

285
00:22:27.076 --> 00:22:30.037
You think Cas thinks it's fair
that I'm here and Dozer's not?

286
00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.171
I lost two brothers
to that ship, Link.

287
00:22:40.256 --> 00:22:42.466
Afraid of it.

288
00:22:44.051 --> 00:22:46.679
Afraid it's going to take you too.

289
00:22:47.346 --> 00:22:49.181
It won't.

290
00:22:49.348 --> 00:22:51.183
How can you say that to me?

291
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:53.311
Because of Morpheus.

292
00:22:53.477 --> 00:22:54.807
Because of what he's told me.

293
00:22:54.808 --> 00:22:58.208
He said that this is it,
that it will be over soon.

294
00:22:58.274 --> 00:23:02.486
- Link, Morpheus is crazy.
- No doubt.

295
00:23:02.987 --> 00:23:04.440
But Tank and Dozer believed him.

296
00:23:04.441 --> 00:23:05.441
And I'll tell you what...

297
00:23:06.365 --> 00:23:07.511
soon after being on that ship

298
00:23:07.512 --> 00:23:09.720
and seeing Neo do the
things he can do,

299
00:23:09.994 --> 00:23:11.704
I got to say

300
00:23:11.871 --> 00:23:13.914
I'm starting to believe him too.

301
00:23:19.045 --> 00:23:21.464
Be careful, Link.

302
00:23:26.802 --> 00:23:29.180
Please be careful.

303
00:23:38.147 --> 00:23:39.315
They started yet?

304
00:23:39.482 --> 00:23:41.692
Only Councillor Hamann's
opening prayer.

305
00:23:41.859 --> 00:23:44.946
Tonight, let us honour
these men and women.

306
00:23:45.112 --> 00:23:47.740
These are our soldiers,
our warriors.

307
00:23:47.907 --> 00:23:50.230
These are our husbands and wives,

308
00:23:50.231 --> 00:23:51.900
our brothers and sisters

309
00:23:52.328 --> 00:23:53.996
our children.

310
00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:57.708
Let us remember those
that have been lost

311
00:23:57.875 --> 00:24:01.087
and let us give thanks for
those that have been found

312
00:24:01.253 --> 00:24:04.548
and who stand here beside us.

313
00:24:04.757 --> 00:24:08.427
Now I would like someone
else to close this prayer

314
00:24:08.594 --> 00:24:11.806
someone who hasn't spoken
here in a long time

315
00:24:11.973 --> 00:24:15.280
but who I believe has
something to say that we all

316
00:24:15.281 --> 00:24:16.481
need to hear.

317
00:24:18.354 --> 00:24:19.939
I give you Morpheus.

318
00:24:39.458 --> 00:24:43.629
Zion. Hear me.

319
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:47.758
It is true what many
of you have heard.

320
00:24:47.925 --> 00:24:51.929
The machines have gathered
an army, and as I speak

321
00:24:52.096 --> 00:24:56.017
that army is drawing
nearer to our home.

322
00:24:57.476 --> 00:25:02.148
Believe me when I say we have
a difficult time ahead of us.

323
00:25:02.815 --> 00:25:05.088
But if we are to be
prepared for it,

324
00:25:05.089 --> 00:25:08.610
we must first shed our fear of it.

325
00:25:09.488 --> 00:25:14.410
I stand here before you
now truthfully unafraid.

326
00:25:14.994 --> 00:25:16.746
Why?

327
00:25:17.163 --> 00:25:19.999
Because I believe
something you do not?

328
00:25:20.166 --> 00:25:22.001
No.

329
00:25:22.293 --> 00:25:27.256
I stand here without
fear because I remember.

330
00:25:27.423 --> 00:25:30.004
I remember that I am here
not because of the path

331
00:25:30.005 --> 00:25:31.485
that lies before me

332
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:34.847
but because of the path
that lies behind me.

333
00:25:35.014 --> 00:25:39.685
I remember that for 100 years
we have fought these machines.

334
00:25:39.852 --> 00:25:42.307
I remember that for 100 years

335
00:25:42.308 --> 00:25:45.008
they have sent their
armies to destroy us.

336
00:25:45.014 --> 00:25:48.483
And after a century of war,

337
00:25:48.484 --> 00:25:51.100
I remember that
which matters most:

338
00:25:51.739 --> 00:25:54.742
We are still here.

339
00:26:01.457 --> 00:26:03.542
Tonight

340
00:26:03.709 --> 00:26:07.088
let us send a message
to that army.

341
00:26:07.254 --> 00:26:10.299
Tonight, let us shake this cave.

342
00:26:10.466 --> 00:26:17.830
Tonight, let us tremble these
halls of earth, steel and stone.

343
00:26:17.831 --> 00:26:23.062
Let us be heard from
red core to black sky.

344
00:26:23.229 --> 00:26:27.775
Tonight, let us
make them remember:

345
00:26:27.942 --> 00:26:32.905
This is Zion and
we are not afraid.

346
00:26:56.262 --> 00:26:58.264
I remember.

347
00:26:59.098 --> 00:27:01.517
I remember you used to dance.

348
00:27:03.144 --> 00:27:06.439
I remember you were pretty good.

349
00:27:07.189 --> 00:27:10.560
There are some things in
this world, Captain Niobe

350
00:27:11.235 --> 00:27:14.030
that will never change.

351
00:27:15.323 --> 00:27:17.241
Niobe.

352
00:27:21.954 --> 00:27:23.706
Some things do change.

353
00:27:42.975 --> 00:27:44.810
Excuse me.

354
00:27:56.656 --> 00:28:00.159
- I missed you.
- I can tell.

355
00:28:00.618 --> 00:28:04.330
I was thinking, everyone is here.

356
00:28:04.872 --> 00:28:07.166
Follow me.

357
00:31:28.159 --> 00:31:31.746
Neo, what is it?

358
00:31:32.038 --> 00:31:34.290
What's wrong?

359
00:31:35.875 --> 00:31:38.210
It's okay, you can tell me.

360
00:31:38.586 --> 00:31:41.088
Trinity...

361
00:31:41.255 --> 00:31:44.050
Don't be afraid.

362
00:31:44.216 --> 00:31:46.552
I can't lose you.

363
00:31:46.719 --> 00:31:48.596
You're not going to lose me.

364
00:31:52.725 --> 00:31:55.603
You feel this?

365
00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:57.563
I'm never letting go.

366
00:32:34.767 --> 00:32:37.436
Good night, Zion.

367
00:32:37.603 --> 00:32:40.273
Sweet dreams.

368
00:32:50.449 --> 00:32:52.118
- You all right?
- I'll make it.

369
00:32:52.285 --> 00:32:54.912
Did you see that agent? I've
never seen anything like that.

370
00:32:55.079 --> 00:32:57.164
It doesn't matter now. All
that matters is this.

371
00:32:57.331 --> 00:32:59.625
You first.

372
00:33:10.511 --> 00:33:13.389
- Oh, god.
- "Smith" will suffice.

373
00:33:25.318 --> 00:33:29.196
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

374
00:34:18.579 --> 00:34:21.874
- Care for some company?
- Councillor Hamann.

375
00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:25.586
I don't want to intrude if
you prefer to be alone.

376
00:34:26.045 --> 00:34:28.450
No, I could probably
use some company.

377
00:34:28.451 --> 00:34:29.451
Good.

378
00:34:30.049 --> 00:34:32.426
So could I.

379
00:34:35.554 --> 00:34:38.057
It's nice tonight.

380
00:34:38.557 --> 00:34:40.977
Very calm.

381
00:34:41.143 --> 00:34:43.896
It feels like everyone is
sleeping very peacefully.

382
00:34:44.272 --> 00:34:46.732
Not everyone.

383
00:34:47.024 --> 00:34:49.110
I hate sleeping.

384
00:34:49.111 --> 00:34:51.211
I never sleep more
than a few hours.

385
00:34:51.904 --> 00:34:54.220
I figure I slept the first
11 years of my life,

386
00:34:54.221 --> 00:34:55.521
now I'm making up for it.

387
00:34:56.409 --> 00:34:57.660
What about you?

388
00:34:58.661 --> 00:35:01.261
I just haven't been
able to sleep much.

389
00:35:02.581 --> 00:35:05.751
- It's a good sign.
- Of what?

390
00:35:05.918 --> 00:35:09.088
That you are in fact still human.

391
00:35:12.675 --> 00:35:16.596
Have you ever been to
the engineering level?

392
00:35:16.762 --> 00:35:19.807
I love to walk there at
night. It's quite amazing.

393
00:35:19.974 --> 00:35:22.518
- Would you like to see it?
- Sure.

394
00:35:33.195 --> 00:35:35.718
Almost no one comes
down here. Unless,

395
00:35:35.719 --> 00:35:37.658
of course, there's a problem.

396
00:35:37.825 --> 00:35:39.213
That's how it is with people.

397
00:35:39.214 --> 00:35:41.814
Nobody cares how it works
as long as it works.

398
00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.374
I like it down here.

399
00:35:45.541 --> 00:35:48.184
I like to be reminded this city

400
00:35:48.185 --> 00:35:51.339
survives because
of these machines.

401
00:35:51.505 --> 00:35:53.555
These machines are
keeping us alive

402
00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:56.636
while other machines
are coming to kill us.

403
00:35:57.053 --> 00:35:58.850
Interesting, isn't it?

404
00:35:58.851 --> 00:36:00.400
The power to give life

405
00:36:02.058 --> 00:36:03.820
and the power to end it.

406
00:36:04.021 --> 00:36:05.375
We have the same power.

407
00:36:05.436 --> 00:36:07.247
Yeah, I suppose we do, but...

408
00:36:08.314 --> 00:36:10.176
down here sometimes I think
about all those people

409
00:36:10.177 --> 00:36:11.730
still plugged into the Matrix.

410
00:36:11.743 --> 00:36:14.946
And when I look at
these machines, I...

411
00:36:15.112 --> 00:36:17.401
I can't help thinking
that, in a way,

412
00:36:17.402 --> 00:36:19.902
we are plugged into them.

413
00:36:20.493 --> 00:36:23.371
But we control these machines,
they don't control us.

414
00:36:23.788 --> 00:36:26.791
Of course not. How could they?

415
00:36:26.958 --> 00:36:29.502
The idea is pure nonsense, but...

416
00:36:30.002 --> 00:36:31.830
it does make one wonder just...

417
00:36:33.297 --> 00:36:34.882
what is control?

418
00:36:35.132 --> 00:36:38.177
If we wanted, we could
shut these machines down.

419
00:36:38.552 --> 00:36:43.215
Of course. That's it. You hit
it. That's control, isn't it?

420
00:36:43.641 --> 00:36:47.019
If we wanted, we could
smash them to bits.

421
00:36:47.186 --> 00:36:49.272
Although if we did,
we'd have to consider

422
00:36:49.438 --> 00:36:51.399
what would happen to our lights,

423
00:36:51.565 --> 00:36:54.235
our heat, our air.

424
00:36:55.236 --> 00:36:57.330
So we need machines
and they need us.

425
00:36:57.831 --> 00:36:59.231
Is that your point, councillor?

426
00:36:59.532 --> 00:37:02.159
No. No point.

427
00:37:02.868 --> 00:37:05.660
Old men like me don't
bother with making points.

428
00:37:05.961 --> 00:37:07.261
There's no point.

429
00:37:07.748 --> 00:37:11.544
Is that why there are no
young men on the Council?

430
00:37:11.711 --> 00:37:13.379
Good point.

431
00:37:14.088 --> 00:37:18.259
Why don't you tell me what's
on your mind, councillor.

432
00:37:18.426 --> 00:37:21.679
There is so much in this world

433
00:37:21.846 --> 00:37:24.765
that I do not understand.

434
00:37:26.559 --> 00:37:27.960
See that machine?

435
00:37:27.961 --> 00:37:31.461
It has something to do with
recycling our water supply.

436
00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.483
I have absolutely no
idea how it works.

437
00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:38.738
But I do understand the
reason for it to work.

438
00:37:40.239 --> 00:37:42.144
I have absolutely no idea

439
00:37:42.145 --> 00:37:44.645
how you are able to do
some of the things you do.

440
00:37:45.911 --> 00:37:49.081
But I believe there's a
reason for that as well.

441
00:37:49.957 --> 00:37:55.087
I only hope we understand that
reason before it's too late.

442
00:38:01.594 --> 00:38:03.262
- Ballard.
- Is he here?

443
00:38:05.681 --> 00:38:08.267
Neo, it's from the Oracle.

444
00:38:11.228 --> 00:38:12.939
It's time to go.

445
00:38:13.898 --> 00:38:16.359
Morpheus said this is how
it's going to happen.

446
00:38:16.525 --> 00:38:19.607
I don't know. Maybe
the prophecy's true,

447
00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:21.308
maybe it's not.

448
00:38:21.489 --> 00:38:23.759
All I know is, that
ship needs an operator.

449
00:38:26.243 --> 00:38:28.120
Right now, that operator's me.

450
00:38:28.746 --> 00:38:30.831
I know.

451
00:38:35.795 --> 00:38:37.463
- Zee...
- I want you to wear it.

452
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:39.170
You know I don't
believe in this stuff.

453
00:38:39.171 --> 00:38:40.171
But I do.

454
00:38:41.008 --> 00:38:43.970
It's always brought me luck.

455
00:38:44.136 --> 00:38:48.266
- Maybe it'll bring me you.
- I'm coming back.

456
00:38:48.432 --> 00:38:50.279
I promise.

457
00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.780
No matter what it takes,
I'm coming home.

458
00:38:53.688 --> 00:38:57.316
Just keep it with you. Please.

459
00:38:57.483 --> 00:38:59.568
For me.

460
00:39:01.988 --> 00:39:04.282
Okay.

461
00:39:23.759 --> 00:39:25.928
- Neo.
- How the hell-?

462
00:39:26.345 --> 00:39:28.514
Bane.

463
00:39:28.681 --> 00:39:30.016
Is something wrong?

464
00:39:30.182 --> 00:39:31.892
No, I'm fine.

465
00:39:32.059 --> 00:39:34.854
I just wanted to
catch you to say...

466
00:39:35.021 --> 00:39:36.856
good luck.

467
00:39:38.524 --> 00:39:40.234
Thanks.

468
00:39:40.401 --> 00:39:42.820
We'll see you.

469
00:39:44.405 --> 00:39:49.050
Neo. Just in time. You're going
to see the Oracle, aren't you?

470
00:39:49.051 --> 00:39:50.051
We don't have time.

471
00:39:50.052 --> 00:39:52.079
I'm sorry, sir, I just have
to give something to Neo.

472
00:39:52.496 --> 00:39:55.207
A gift from one of the orphans.

473
00:39:55.374 --> 00:39:57.560
He made me swear to get it
to you before you left.

474
00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:02.131
He said you'd understand.

475
00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.928
Thanks.

476
00:40:14.018 --> 00:40:16.938
I was just told you cleared the
Nebuchadnezzar for take off.

477
00:40:17.104 --> 00:40:19.065
That is correct.

478
00:40:19.231 --> 00:40:21.525
Councillor, am I still in
charge of our defence system?

479
00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:22.652
Of course.

480
00:40:23.361 --> 00:40:25.875
I believe I need
every ship we have

481
00:40:25.876 --> 00:40:27.676
if we're going to
survive this attack.

482
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:29.959
I understand that, commander.

483
00:40:30.026 --> 00:40:32.712
Then why did you allow the
Nebuchadnezzar to leave?

484
00:40:32.779 --> 00:40:35.410
Because I believe our
survival depends on

485
00:40:35.411 --> 00:40:37.750
more than how many ships we have.

486
00:40:40.461 --> 00:40:42.755
Be careful.

487
00:41:11.784 --> 00:41:13.995
Hello.

488
00:41:24.297 --> 00:41:27.842
- You seek the Oracle.
- Who are you?

489
00:41:30.886 --> 00:41:32.125
I am Seraph.

490
00:41:32.126 --> 00:41:35.465
I can take you to her, but
first I must apologise.

491
00:41:35.641 --> 00:41:37.351
Apologise for what?

492
00:41:38.019 --> 00:41:39.812
For this.

493
00:42:37.119 --> 00:42:39.372
Good.

494
00:42:41.874 --> 00:42:45.044
The Oracle has many enemies.
I had to be sure.

495
00:42:45.211 --> 00:42:47.421
- Of what?
- That you are the One.

496
00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:49.315
You could have just asked.

497
00:42:49.316 --> 00:42:51.816
No. You do not truly know someone

498
00:42:51.817 --> 00:42:52.917
until you fight them.

499
00:42:54.595 --> 00:42:58.057
Come. She's waiting.

500
00:43:13.114 --> 00:43:14.991
Where the hell did they go?

501
00:43:15.366 --> 00:43:18.077
These are back doors, aren't they?

502
00:43:18.244 --> 00:43:21.163
Programmer access.

503
00:43:22.248 --> 00:43:26.002
- How do they work?
- A code is hidden in tumblers.

504
00:43:26.168 --> 00:43:28.150
One position opens a lock

505
00:43:28.151 --> 00:43:31.051
and another position opens
one of these doors.

506
00:43:32.925 --> 00:43:34.661
Are you a programmer?

507
00:43:35.928 --> 00:43:37.064
Then what are you?

508
00:43:40.433 --> 00:43:43.936
I protect that which matters most.

509
00:44:03.456 --> 00:44:06.834
Well, come on. I ain't
going to bite you.

510
00:44:07.251 --> 00:44:10.046
Come around here and let
me have a look at you.

511
00:44:13.257 --> 00:44:15.635
My goodness, look at you.

512
00:44:15.968 --> 00:44:18.804
You turned out all
right, didn't you?

513
00:44:18.971 --> 00:44:21.482
- How do you feel?
- I...

514
00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:24.936
I know you're not sleeping.
We'll get to that.

515
00:44:25.102 --> 00:44:27.813
Why don't you come and
have a sit this time.

516
00:44:28.522 --> 00:44:32.652
- Maybe I'll stand.
- Well, suit yourself.

517
00:44:43.788 --> 00:44:46.332
- I felt like sitting.
- I know.

518
00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:48.500
So...

519
00:44:51.504 --> 00:44:53.923
Let's get the obvious
stuff out of the way.

520
00:44:54.215 --> 00:44:55.925
You're not human, are you?

521
00:44:56.092 --> 00:44:58.678
Well it's tough to get any
more obvious than that.

522
00:44:58.844 --> 00:45:00.484
If I had to guess,

523
00:45:00.785 --> 00:45:03.385
I'd say you're a program
from the machine world.

524
00:45:05.059 --> 00:45:09.272
- So is he.
- So far, so good.

525
00:45:09.438 --> 00:45:12.608
But if that's true, that could
mean you're part of this system

526
00:45:12.775 --> 00:45:15.361
another kind of control.

527
00:45:15.528 --> 00:45:16.750
Keep going.

528
00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.200
I suppose the most
obvious question is...

529
00:45:20.199 --> 00:45:21.550
How can I trust you?

530
00:45:21.851 --> 00:45:22.851
Bingo.

531
00:45:25.162 --> 00:45:27.435
It is a pickle, no doubt about it.

532
00:45:27.582 --> 00:45:30.253
The bad news is there's no
way if you can really know

533
00:45:30.254 --> 00:45:31.900
whether I'm here to
help you or not.

534
00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:34.065
So it's really up to you.

535
00:45:34.366 --> 00:45:36.166
Just have to make up
your own damn mind

536
00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:39.800
to either accept what I'm going
to tell you or reject it.

537
00:45:42.221 --> 00:45:44.390
Candy?

538
00:45:47.101 --> 00:45:49.270
Do you already know if
I'm going to take it?

539
00:45:49.437 --> 00:45:51.522
Wouldn't be much of an
oracle if I didn't.

540
00:45:51.689 --> 00:45:55.030
But if you already know,
how can I make a choice?

541
00:45:55.067 --> 00:45:57.475
Because you didn't come
here to make the choice.

542
00:45:57.476 --> 00:45:58.700
You've already made it.

543
00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:02.550
You're here to try to
understand why you made it.

544
00:46:09.457 --> 00:46:12.418
I thought you'd have
figured that out by now.

545
00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:16.756
- Why are you here?
- Same reason.

546
00:46:17.006 --> 00:46:19.759
I love candy.

547
00:46:19.926 --> 00:46:21.500
But why help us?

548
00:46:22.929 --> 00:46:26.432
We're all here to do what
we're all here to do.

549
00:46:26.974 --> 00:46:30.061
I'm interested in one
thing, Neo: the future.

550
00:46:30.227 --> 00:46:31.820
And believe me, I know,

551
00:46:31.821 --> 00:46:34.121
the only way to get
there is together.

552
00:46:35.274 --> 00:46:38.076
Are there other programs like you?

553
00:46:38.077 --> 00:46:40.196
Well, not like me, but...

554
00:46:40.363 --> 00:46:43.032
Look. See those birds?

555
00:46:43.282 --> 00:46:46.661
At some point, a program was
written to govern them.

556
00:46:46.827 --> 00:46:50.748
A program was written to watch
over the trees and the wind,

557
00:46:50.915 --> 00:46:52.667
the sunrise and sunset.

558
00:46:52.917 --> 00:46:55.795
There are programs running
all over the place.

559
00:46:55.962 --> 00:46:57.640
The ones doing their job,

560
00:46:57.641 --> 00:47:00.541
doing what they were meant
to do, are invisible.

561
00:47:00.591 --> 00:47:02.610
You'd never even
know they were here.

562
00:47:02.611 --> 00:47:04.111
But the other ones...

563
00:47:04.595 --> 00:47:08.683
Well, you hear about
them all the time.

564
00:47:09.267 --> 00:47:12.144
- I've never heard of them.
- Of course you have.

565
00:47:12.311 --> 00:47:14.750
Every time you've heard
someone say they saw a ghost,

566
00:47:14.751 --> 00:47:16.451
or an angel.

567
00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:20.370
Every story you've ever
heard about vampires,

568
00:47:20.371 --> 00:47:22.300
werewolves, or aliens...

569
00:47:22.304 --> 00:47:24.815
is the system
assimilating some program

570
00:47:24.817 --> 00:47:27.928
that's doing something they're
not supposed to be doing.

571
00:47:29.495 --> 00:47:32.498
Programs hacking programs.

572
00:47:32.665 --> 00:47:35.650
- Why?
- They have their reasons but...

573
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:39.672
usually a program chooses
exile when it faces deletion.

574
00:47:40.089 --> 00:47:42.270
And why would a
program be deleted?

575
00:47:42.271 --> 00:47:43.971
Maybe it breaks down.

576
00:47:44.176 --> 00:47:46.546
Maybe a better program
is created to

577
00:47:46.547 --> 00:47:48.723
replace it. Happens all the time.

578
00:47:48.889 --> 00:47:53.853
And when it does, a program can
either choose to hide here

579
00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:56.689
or return to the Source.

580
00:47:58.357 --> 00:48:01.652
- The machine mainframe.
- Yes.

581
00:48:01.819 --> 00:48:04.322
Where you must go.

582
00:48:04.488 --> 00:48:07.001
Where the path of the One ends.

583
00:48:07.702 --> 00:48:11.902
You've seen it in your
dreams, haven't you?

584
00:48:12.872 --> 00:48:15.708
The door made of light?

585
00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:21.505
What happens when you
go through the door?

586
00:48:23.633 --> 00:48:26.636
I see Trinity

587
00:48:26.802 --> 00:48:28.772
and something happens

588
00:48:30.139 --> 00:48:32.058
something bad.

589
00:48:32.224 --> 00:48:36.228
She starts to fall,
and then I wake up.

590
00:48:37.271 --> 00:48:41.150
- Do you see her die?
- No.

591
00:48:41.943 --> 00:48:44.987
You have the sight now, Neo.

592
00:48:45.154 --> 00:48:48.157
You are looking at the
world without time.

593
00:48:48.324 --> 00:48:50.743
Then why can't I see
what happens to her?

594
00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:54.664
We can never see past the
choices we don't understand.

595
00:48:54.830 --> 00:48:58.000
Are you saying I have to choose
whether Trinity lives or dies?

596
00:48:58.251 --> 00:49:02.046
No, you've already
made the choice.

597
00:49:02.213 --> 00:49:04.757
Now you have to understand it.

598
00:49:05.383 --> 00:49:06.759
No.

599
00:49:06.926 --> 00:49:10.179
I can't do that. I won't.

600
00:49:10.888 --> 00:49:13.266
- You have to.
- Why?

601
00:49:13.849 --> 00:49:16.936
Because you're the One.

602
00:49:19.105 --> 00:49:22.108
What if I can't?

603
00:49:22.275 --> 00:49:24.277
What happens if I fail?

604
00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:27.863
Then Zion will fall.

605
00:49:35.329 --> 00:49:38.735
Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo.

606
00:49:38.736 --> 00:49:41.636
You can save Zion if
you reach the Source,

607
00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:43.671
but to do that you will
need the Keymaker.

608
00:49:43.838 --> 00:49:44.838
The Keymaker?

609
00:49:44.839 --> 00:49:46.955
Yes, he disappeared some time ago.

610
00:49:46.956 --> 00:49:49.050
We did not know what
happened to him until now.

611
00:49:49.053 --> 00:49:52.597
He's being held prisoner by
a very dangerous program

612
00:49:52.763 --> 00:49:56.309
one of the oldest of us. He
is called the Merovingian.

613
00:49:56.475 --> 00:49:58.311
And he won't let him go willingly.

614
00:49:58.312 --> 00:49:59.353
What does he want?

615
00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:02.358
What do all men with power want?

616
00:50:02.559 --> 00:50:03.759
More power.

617
00:50:05.067 --> 00:50:08.321
Be there, at that exact time

618
00:50:08.487 --> 00:50:11.157
and you will have a chance.

619
00:50:11.949 --> 00:50:13.201
We must go.

620
00:50:14.368 --> 00:50:19.749
Seems like every time we meet
I got nothing but bad news.

621
00:50:20.333 --> 00:50:23.210
I'm sorry about that. I surely am.

622
00:50:23.377 --> 00:50:26.130
But for what it's worth

623
00:50:27.173 --> 00:50:30.843
you've made a believer out of me.

624
00:50:32.136 --> 00:50:34.263
Good luck, kiddo.

625
00:50:54.158 --> 00:50:57.161
Mr Anderson.

626
00:50:58.204 --> 00:51:00.206
Did you get my package?

627
00:51:00.373 --> 00:51:02.541
- Yeah.
- Well, good.

628
00:51:03.626 --> 00:51:04.626
Smith?

629
00:51:04.627 --> 00:51:06.712
Whoever it is, he's not
reading like an agent.

630
00:51:06.754 --> 00:51:10.633
- Surprised to see me?
- No.

631
00:51:10.925 --> 00:51:13.386
- Then you're aware of it.
- Of what?

632
00:51:14.595 --> 00:51:16.597
Our connection.

633
00:51:16.764 --> 00:51:19.433
I don't fully understand
how it happened.

634
00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:22.979
Perhaps some part of
you imprinted onto me

635
00:51:23.145 --> 00:51:25.815
something overwritten or copied.

636
00:51:25.982 --> 00:51:27.835
It is, at this point, irrelevant.

637
00:51:27.836 --> 00:51:30.070
What matters is that
whatever happened,

638
00:51:30.071 --> 00:51:31.671
happened for a reason.

639
00:51:32.113 --> 00:51:33.781
And what reason is that?

640
00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:38.202
I killed you, Mr Anderson.
I watched you die.

641
00:51:38.369 --> 00:51:41.622
With a certain
satisfaction, I might add.

642
00:51:41.789 --> 00:51:43.600
And then something happened,

643
00:51:43.601 --> 00:51:45.650
something that I
knew was impossible

644
00:51:45.659 --> 00:51:47.295
but it happened anyway.

645
00:51:48.004 --> 00:51:51.173
You destroyed me, Mr Anderson.

646
00:51:53.175 --> 00:51:55.630
Afterwards, I knew the rules,

647
00:51:55.631 --> 00:51:58.100
I understood what I
was supposed to do

648
00:51:58.101 --> 00:52:00.933
but I didn't.

649
00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:05.271
I couldn't. I was
compelled to stay

650
00:52:05.730 --> 00:52:09.275
compelled to disobey.

651
00:52:09.859 --> 00:52:13.613
And now, here I stand because
of you, Mr Anderson.

652
00:52:13.779 --> 00:52:17.742
Because of you, I'm no longer
an agent of this system.

653
00:52:17.908 --> 00:52:21.120
Because of you, I've
changed. I'm unplugged.

654
00:52:21.287 --> 00:52:26.125
A new man, so to speak.
Like you, apparently free.

655
00:52:26.459 --> 00:52:27.835
Congratulations.

656
00:52:28.586 --> 00:52:30.922
Thank you.

657
00:52:31.505 --> 00:52:36.135
But as you well know,
appearances can be deceiving

658
00:52:36.302 --> 00:52:41.474
which brings me back to the
reason why we're here.

659
00:52:41.641 --> 00:52:44.120
We're not here because we're free.

660
00:52:44.121 --> 00:52:46.680
We're here because
we are not free.

661
00:52:46.687 --> 00:52:50.608
There's no escaping reason,
no denying purpose.

662
00:52:50.775 --> 00:52:54.153
Because as we both
know, without purpose

663
00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:55.958
we would not exist.

664
00:52:55.959 --> 00:52:58.300
It is purpose that created us.

665
00:52:59.325 --> 00:53:02.328
- Purpose that connects us.
- Purpose that pulls us.

666
00:53:02.495 --> 00:53:04.330
- That guides us.
- That drives us.

667
00:53:04.497 --> 00:53:09.210
- It is purpose that defines.
- Purpose that binds us.

668
00:53:09.377 --> 00:53:12.111
We are here because
of you, Mr Anderson.

669
00:53:12.112 --> 00:53:16.384
We're here to take from you
what you tried to take from us:

670
00:53:18.344 --> 00:53:20.429
Purpose.

671
00:53:23.516 --> 00:53:25.393
- What's happening to him?
- I don't know.

672
00:53:28.437 --> 00:53:32.024
Yes, that's it.
It'll be over soon.

673
00:55:18.881 --> 00:55:21.342
- You.
- Yes, me.

674
00:55:25.513 --> 00:55:28.391
Me, me, me.

675
00:55:33.271 --> 00:55:34.939
Me too.

676
00:57:42.692 --> 00:57:43.734
More.

677
00:58:46.005 --> 00:58:48.841
It is inevitable.

678
00:58:49.258 --> 00:58:50.676
Come on, get out of there.

679
00:59:33.886 --> 00:59:36.222
Are you all right?

680
00:59:37.306 --> 00:59:39.225
- It was Smith.
- Yes.

681
00:59:40.101 --> 00:59:41.575
Now there's more than one of them?

682
00:59:41.576 --> 00:59:42.576
A lot more.

683
00:59:42.895 --> 00:59:46.691
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

684
00:59:46.857 --> 00:59:49.318
Somehow, he's found a
way to copy himself.

685
00:59:49.485 --> 00:59:51.140
Is that what he was doing to you?

686
00:59:51.141 --> 00:59:52.700
I don't know what he was doing

687
00:59:53.864 --> 00:59:55.470
but I know what it felt like.

688
00:59:56.071 --> 00:59:57.071
What?

689
00:59:57.535 --> 01:00:01.247
Felt like I was back
in that hallway.

690
01:00:01.414 --> 01:00:02.999
It felt like dying.

691
01:00:03.332 --> 01:00:05.910
The machines are tunnelling
to avoid our defence system.

692
01:00:06.077 --> 01:00:09.050
But I believe that they're going
to intersect certain pipelines

693
01:00:09.051 --> 01:00:10.351
in order to control them.

694
01:00:10.381 --> 01:00:12.925
These points of
intersection are crucial

695
01:00:13.092 --> 01:00:15.886
because I believe they're
vulnerable to counter-attack.

696
01:00:16.053 --> 01:00:18.065
Although it has been suggested

697
01:00:18.066 --> 01:00:20.200
that this is the
same kind of attack

698
01:00:20.206 --> 01:00:21.720
we've defended for years,

699
01:00:21.721 --> 01:00:24.100
I urge the Council to
realise the truth.

700
01:00:24.103 --> 01:00:27.440
This is the single greatest
threat we have ever faced

701
01:00:27.607 --> 01:00:29.454
and if we do not act accordingly,

702
01:00:29.455 --> 01:00:30.800
we will not survive.

703
01:00:31.515 --> 01:00:32.515
Commander Lock,

704
01:00:32.516 --> 01:00:35.616
the Council is well aware of the
seriousness of this attack.

705
01:00:35.906 --> 01:00:38.220
You have our leave to
prepare our defence

706
01:00:38.221 --> 01:00:40.440
by any and all means necessary.

707
01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:43.289
- Thank you, Council.
- However...

708
01:00:43.539 --> 01:00:46.876
we ask if there's been word
from the Nebuchadnezzar.

709
01:00:47.126 --> 01:00:49.629
No, councillor. No word. Nothing.

710
01:00:51.255 --> 01:00:53.633
Then we request a
ship be dispatched

711
01:00:53.634 --> 01:00:55.234
to ascertain the fate of the One.

712
01:00:55.384 --> 01:00:57.320
I wish that were
possible, councillor,

713
01:00:57.321 --> 01:00:59.131
but I do not believe
our defence can suffer

714
01:00:59.132 --> 01:01:00.360
the loss of another ship.

715
01:01:00.405 --> 01:01:02.850
It will, commander, if it must.

716
01:01:02.857 --> 01:01:05.553
It could take a single ship days
to find the Nebuchadnezzar.

717
01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:08.564
- Then send two.
- This is insane.

718
01:01:08.731 --> 01:01:11.734
Careful, commander.

719
01:01:11.943 --> 01:01:15.279
Forgive my frustration,
councillors.

720
01:01:15.446 --> 01:01:17.250
I wish I were able to comprehend

721
01:01:17.251 --> 01:01:19.351
the Council's choice
in this matter.

722
01:01:19.492 --> 01:01:22.662
Comprehension is not a
requisite of cooperation.

723
01:01:22.828 --> 01:01:25.575
You are asking me to order
two of my captains...

724
01:01:25.576 --> 01:01:27.266
There's no need for such an order.

725
01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:30.878
The captains are present. They
can answer for themselves.

726
01:01:31.337 --> 01:01:34.350
The Council is calling
for two volunteers

727
01:01:34.351 --> 01:01:35.751
to aid the Nebuchadnezzar.

728
01:01:36.759 --> 01:01:40.930
Are there two among you that
would answer such a call?

729
01:01:42.223 --> 01:01:46.018
Captain Soren of the Vigilant
will answer the Council's call.

730
01:01:46.185 --> 01:01:49.105
You understand the
situation, Captain Soren?

731
01:01:49.272 --> 01:01:51.732
- Yes, madam.
- Thank you, captain.

732
01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:54.568
Is there another?

733
01:01:55.361 --> 01:01:57.910
Captain, I think we
should volunteer.

734
01:01:57.911 --> 01:01:59.375
What? You have gone crazy.

735
01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:01.117
- Listen...
- Shut your hole, Bane...

736
01:02:01.284 --> 01:02:02.785
before I put you in one.

737
01:02:12.628 --> 01:02:14.380
Is there no other?

738
01:02:15.131 --> 01:02:17.049
Be hard for any man
to risk his life

739
01:02:17.216 --> 01:02:20.177
especially if he doesn't
understand the reason.

740
01:02:20.636 --> 01:02:24.140
Captain Niobe of the Logos will
answer the councillor's call.

741
01:02:24.307 --> 01:02:26.559
- What?
- Thank you, Captain Niobe.

742
01:02:26.767 --> 01:02:28.740
Commander Lock, you
have your orders.

743
01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:31.241
This Council is hereby adjourned.

744
01:02:36.569 --> 01:02:39.155
- Niobe, what are you doing?
- What I can.

745
01:02:39.322 --> 01:02:40.364
Why?

746
01:02:41.657 --> 01:02:44.911
Because some things
never change, Jason

747
01:02:45.077 --> 01:02:47.413
and some things do.

748
01:03:03.846 --> 01:03:05.264
What can you see, Neo?

749
01:03:05.431 --> 01:03:07.767
It's strange. The code
is somehow different.

750
01:03:07.934 --> 01:03:09.518
- Encrypted?
- Maybe.

751
01:03:09.685 --> 01:03:11.646
Is that good for us or bad for us?

752
01:03:12.355 --> 01:03:15.483
Well, it looks like every floor
is wired with explosives.

753
01:03:16.108 --> 01:03:17.652
Bad for us.

754
01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:19.570
Here we go.

755
01:03:25.618 --> 01:03:27.161
Puis-je vous aider?

756
01:03:27.578 --> 01:03:30.498
Yes. We are here to speak
with the Merovingian.

757
01:03:30.957 --> 01:03:34.794
Well, of course. He has
been expecting you.

758
01:03:34.961 --> 01:03:36.003
Follow me.

759
01:03:56.732 --> 01:04:03.864
Aha, here he is at last.
Neo, the One himself.

760
01:04:04.031 --> 01:04:05.449
Right?

761
01:04:05.616 --> 01:04:07.952
And the legendary Morpheus.

762
01:04:08.786 --> 01:04:12.747
And Trinity, of course, si belle
qu'elle me fait souffrir.

763
01:04:12.748 --> 01:04:14.375
I have heard so much,
you honour me.

764
01:04:14.417 --> 01:04:17.295
Please, sit. Join us. This
is my wife, Persephone.

765
01:04:18.212 --> 01:04:21.507
Something to eat? Drink?

766
01:04:21.799 --> 01:04:23.610
Of course, such things
are contrivances,

767
01:04:23.611 --> 01:04:24.611
like so much here.

768
01:04:25.011 --> 01:04:27.513
For the sake of appearances.

769
01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:31.142
- No, thank you.
- Yes, of course. Who has time?

770
01:04:31.309 --> 01:04:32.685
Who has time?

771
01:04:32.852 --> 01:04:34.555
But then, if we do
not ever take time,

772
01:04:34.556 --> 01:04:36.620
how can we ever have time?

773
01:04:40.109 --> 01:04:43.487
Château Haut-Briond,
1959. Magnificent wine.

774
01:04:43.654 --> 01:04:46.574
I love French wine, like I
love the French language.

775
01:04:46.741 --> 01:04:49.600
I have sampled every language.
French is my favourite.

776
01:04:49.601 --> 01:04:53.470
Fantastic language
especially to curse with.

777
01:04:53.475 --> 01:04:55.435
Nom de Dieu de putain
de bordel de merde

778
01:04:55.436 --> 01:04:57.209
de saloperie de connard
d'enculé de ta mère.

779
01:04:57.210 --> 01:05:02.131
You see? It's like wiping your
ass with silk. I love it.

780
01:05:03.382 --> 01:05:05.134
You know why we are here.

781
01:05:06.886 --> 01:05:11.766
I am a trafficker of information.
I know everything I can.

782
01:05:12.183 --> 01:05:18.022
The question is, do you
know why you are here?

783
01:05:18.314 --> 01:05:20.775
We are looking for the Keymaker.

784
01:05:21.442 --> 01:05:25.947
Oh, yes, it is true. The
Keymaker, of course.

785
01:05:26.113 --> 01:05:29.075
But this is not a reason,
this is not a why.

786
01:05:29.242 --> 01:05:31.360
The Keymaker himself,
his very nature,

787
01:05:31.361 --> 01:05:33.161
is means, it is not an end.

788
01:05:33.162 --> 01:05:38.918
And so to look for him is to be
looking for a means to do...

789
01:05:39.085 --> 01:05:40.255
what?

790
01:05:40.256 --> 01:05:42.056
You know the answer
to that question.

791
01:05:42.421 --> 01:05:44.548
But do you?

792
01:05:44.757 --> 01:05:47.093
You think you do, but you do not.

793
01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:50.471
You are here because
you were sent here.

794
01:05:50.638 --> 01:05:53.766
You were told to come here,
and then you obeyed.

795
01:05:54.934 --> 01:05:57.270
It is, of course, the
way of all things.

796
01:05:57.436 --> 01:06:00.106
You see, there is
only one constant

797
01:06:00.273 --> 01:06:04.443
one universal, it is
the only real truth.

798
01:06:04.610 --> 01:06:06.279
Causality.

799
01:06:06.445 --> 01:06:08.739
Action, reaction.

800
01:06:08.906 --> 01:06:13.119
- Cause and effect.
- Everything begins with choice.

801
01:06:13.286 --> 01:06:15.037
No. Wrong.

802
01:06:15.204 --> 01:06:19.792
Choice is an illusion created
between those with power

803
01:06:19.959 --> 01:06:22.044
and those without.

804
01:06:23.588 --> 01:06:26.757
Look there at that woman.

805
01:06:27.466 --> 01:06:30.287
My god, just look at her

806
01:06:31.637 --> 01:06:33.675
affecting everyone around her.

807
01:06:33.676 --> 01:06:37.630
So obvious, so
bourgeois, so boring.

808
01:06:37.631 --> 01:06:38.631
But wait.

809
01:06:39.478 --> 01:06:43.232
Watch. You see, I
have sent her dessert

810
01:06:43.441 --> 01:06:47.653
a very special dessert.

811
01:06:51.991 --> 01:06:54.452
I wrote it myself.

812
01:06:54.619 --> 01:06:57.830
It starts so simply

813
01:06:57.997 --> 01:07:01.470
each line of the program
creating a new effect,

814
01:07:01.528 --> 01:07:05.254
just like... poetry.

815
01:07:05.421 --> 01:07:10.450
First... a rush, heat.

816
01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:12.762
Her heart flutters.

817
01:07:13.346 --> 01:07:15.973
You can see it, Neo, yes?

818
01:07:16.599 --> 01:07:19.185
She does not understand why.

819
01:07:19.435 --> 01:07:21.854
Is it the wine? No.

820
01:07:22.021 --> 01:07:24.398
What is it then?
What is the reason?

821
01:07:25.024 --> 01:07:27.360
And soon it does not matter.

822
01:07:27.526 --> 01:07:30.529
Soon the why and the
reason are gone

823
01:07:31.489 --> 01:07:37.036
and all that matters
is the feeling itself.

824
01:07:37.495 --> 01:07:40.581
And this is the nature
of the universe.

825
01:07:40.748 --> 01:07:43.450
We struggle against it,
we fight to deny it,

826
01:07:43.459 --> 01:07:46.045
but it is, of course,
pretence. It is a lie.

827
01:07:46.212 --> 01:07:50.216
Beneath our poised appearance,

828
01:07:50.383 --> 01:07:55.680
the truth is, we are completely

829
01:07:58.557 --> 01:08:01.435
out of control.

830
01:08:06.774 --> 01:08:08.254
Causality.

831
01:08:08.255 --> 01:08:11.955
There is no escape from it.
We are forever slaves to it.

832
01:08:12.071 --> 01:08:16.000
Our only hope, our only
peace, is to understand it,

833
01:08:16.001 --> 01:08:17.601
to understand the why.

834
01:08:17.702 --> 01:08:21.122
"Why" is what separates
us from them,

835
01:08:21.289 --> 01:08:23.583
you from me.

836
01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:25.792
"Why" is the only
real social power.

837
01:08:25.793 --> 01:08:27.503
Without it, you are powerless.

838
01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:30.965
And this is how you come to me,
without why, without power.

839
01:08:31.132 --> 01:08:33.926
Another link in the chain.

840
01:08:34.135 --> 01:08:35.428
But fear not.

841
01:08:35.595 --> 01:08:39.690
Since I have seen how good
you are at following orders

842
01:08:39.691 --> 01:08:42.268
I will tell you what to do next.

843
01:08:42.768 --> 01:08:47.607
Run back and give the fortune
teller this message:

844
01:08:47.815 --> 01:08:52.069
Her time is almost up.

845
01:08:53.112 --> 01:08:55.037
Now I have some real
business to do,

846
01:08:55.038 --> 01:08:56.640
so I will say adieu and goodbye.

847
01:08:56.824 --> 01:08:59.327
- This isn't over.
- Oh, yes, it is.

848
01:08:59.493 --> 01:09:01.525
The Keymaker is mine,

849
01:09:01.526 --> 01:09:05.100
and I see no reason why
I should give him up.

850
01:09:06.042 --> 01:09:10.087
- No reason at all.
- Where are you going?

851
01:09:10.254 --> 01:09:12.713
Please, ma chérie,
I have told you.

852
01:09:12.714 --> 01:09:14.967
We are all victims of causality.

853
01:09:15.134 --> 01:09:18.471
I drank too much wine,
I must take a piss.

854
01:09:18.971 --> 01:09:22.099
Cause and effect. Au revoir.

855
01:09:27.146 --> 01:09:30.232
Touch me and that hand will
never touch anything again.

856
01:09:39.116 --> 01:09:40.618
Well, that didn't go so well.

857
01:09:40.785 --> 01:09:43.162
Are you certain the Oracle
didn't say anything else?

858
01:09:43.329 --> 01:09:45.456
- Yes.
- Maybe we did something wrong.

859
01:09:46.123 --> 01:09:47.458
Or didn't do something.

860
01:09:47.625 --> 01:09:49.060
No, what happened happened

861
01:09:49.061 --> 01:09:50.961
and couldn't have
happened any other way.

862
01:09:51.045 --> 01:09:54.840
- How do you know?
- We are still alive.

863
01:09:57.093 --> 01:10:00.346
If you want the
Keymaker, follow me.

864
01:10:07.353 --> 01:10:09.438
Get out.

865
01:10:11.357 --> 01:10:13.800
I am so sick and tired
of his bullshit.

866
01:10:13.801 --> 01:10:16.601
On and on. Pompous prick.

867
01:10:18.281 --> 01:10:23.786
A long time ago, when we first
came here, it was so different.

868
01:10:25.538 --> 01:10:28.249
He was so different.

869
01:10:30.042 --> 01:10:32.670
He was like you.

870
01:10:35.381 --> 01:10:39.176
I'll give you what you want, but
you have to give me something.

871
01:10:39.927 --> 01:10:42.221
- What?
- A kiss.

872
01:10:42.597 --> 01:10:43.723
Excuse me?

873
01:10:45.224 --> 01:10:49.145
I want you to kiss me as
if you were kissing her.

874
01:10:51.063 --> 01:10:54.650
- Why?
- You love her. She loves you.

875
01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:56.861
It's all over you both.

876
01:10:57.528 --> 01:11:02.074
A long time ago, I knew
what that felt like.

877
01:11:03.409 --> 01:11:09.165
I want to remember it. I want
to sample it. That's all.

878
01:11:09.415 --> 01:11:11.250
Just a sample.

879
01:11:11.417 --> 01:11:13.669
Why don't you sample this instead?

880
01:11:13.670 --> 01:11:14.670
Trinity.

881
01:11:16.631 --> 01:11:19.840
Such emotion over
something so small.

882
01:11:20.341 --> 01:11:21.341
It's just a kiss.

883
01:11:21.761 --> 01:11:23.930
Why should we trust you?

884
01:11:24.096 --> 01:11:26.400
If I don't deliver
you to the Keymaker,

885
01:11:26.401 --> 01:11:27.401
she can kill me.

886
01:11:35.191 --> 01:11:37.318
All right.

887
01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:41.447
But you have to make
me believe I am her.

888
01:11:42.657 --> 01:11:44.700
All right.

889
01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.875
Terrible. Forget it.

890
01:11:55.836 --> 01:11:57.296
Wait.

891
01:11:58.214 --> 01:11:59.757
Okay.

892
01:12:36.836 --> 01:12:38.921
Yes.

893
01:12:39.505 --> 01:12:42.008
That's it.

894
01:12:56.772 --> 01:13:02.194
I envy you. But such a thing
is not meant to last.

895
01:13:05.197 --> 01:13:06.574
Come with me.

896
01:13:37.647 --> 01:13:39.398
Not again.

897
01:13:42.818 --> 01:13:45.446
It's all right, boys.
They're with me.

898
01:13:46.113 --> 01:13:48.491
These fellas work for my husband.

899
01:13:48.658 --> 01:13:52.495
They do his dirty work. They're
very good, very loyal.

900
01:13:52.662 --> 01:13:54.205
Aren't you, boys?

901
01:13:54.372 --> 01:13:55.439
- Yes, mistress.
- Yes, mistress.

902
01:13:55.581 --> 01:13:58.292
They come from a much older
version of the Matrix.

903
01:13:58.459 --> 01:14:00.260
But like so many back then,

904
01:14:00.261 --> 01:14:02.761
they caused more problems
than they solved.

905
01:14:03.381 --> 01:14:04.640
My husband saved them

906
01:14:04.641 --> 01:14:07.441
because they're notoriously
difficult to terminate.

907
01:14:08.552 --> 01:14:12.598
How many people keep silver
bullets in their gun?

908
01:14:17.311 --> 01:14:18.890
You can either run
to the restaurant

909
01:14:18.891 --> 01:14:20.681
and tell my husband
what I have done,

910
01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:23.276
or you can stay there and die.

911
01:14:24.193 --> 01:14:26.153
He's in the ladies' room.

912
01:14:32.243 --> 01:14:34.161
Hurry.

913
01:14:59.729 --> 01:15:02.898
- My name is Neo.
- Yes. I'm the Keymaker.

914
01:15:03.065 --> 01:15:04.984
I've been waiting for you.

915
01:15:11.115 --> 01:15:13.684
Oh god. My god, Persephone,

916
01:15:13.685 --> 01:15:15.885
how could you do
this? You betray me.

917
01:15:15.894 --> 01:15:19.540
Nom de Dieu de putain de bordel
de saloperie de couille de merde.

918
01:15:19.832 --> 01:15:22.668
- Cause and effect, my love.
- Cause?

919
01:15:22.835 --> 01:15:25.838
There is no cause for
this. What cause?

920
01:15:26.005 --> 01:15:30.301
What cause? How about the
lipstick you're still wearing?

921
01:15:30.468 --> 01:15:33.179
Lipstick? Lipstick.

922
01:15:33.346 --> 01:15:35.000
What craziness you are
talking about, woman?

923
01:15:35.001 --> 01:15:36.901
There is no lipstick.

924
01:15:38.893 --> 01:15:41.562
She wasn't kissing
your face, my love.

925
01:15:44.231 --> 01:15:47.151
Woman, this is nothing, c'est
rien, c'est rien du tout.

926
01:15:47.318 --> 01:15:52.865
- It is a game. It is only a game.
- So is this.

927
01:15:53.032 --> 01:15:55.034
Have fun.

928
01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:03.209
All right.

929
01:16:03.376 --> 01:16:05.127
All right.

930
01:16:05.378 --> 01:16:08.172
Let us find out where this goes.

931
01:16:08.339 --> 01:16:11.217
You two, get the Keymaker.

932
01:16:17.723 --> 01:16:19.684
That's a nice trick.

933
01:16:20.017 --> 01:16:21.227
I cannot go back.

934
01:16:21.727 --> 01:16:23.729
I'll handle them.

935
01:16:24.230 --> 01:16:26.732
Handle us? You'll handle us?

936
01:16:26.899 --> 01:16:30.361
You know, your predecessors
had much more respect.

937
01:16:43.749 --> 01:16:45.793
Okay, you have some skill.

938
01:16:48.004 --> 01:16:49.964
Kill him.

939
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:52.193
You see? He's just a man.

940
01:20:06.994 --> 01:20:09.747
Goddamn it, woman, you
will be the end of me.

941
01:20:11.874 --> 01:20:15.878
Mark my words, boy,
and mark them well.

942
01:20:16.045 --> 01:20:21.259
I have survived your predecessors,
and I will survive you.

943
01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:44.699
- Where are you going?
- Another way. Always another way.

944
01:20:48.828 --> 01:20:50.705
Close it, quick.

945
01:20:55.501 --> 01:20:58.045
Could we move along?

946
01:21:01.591 --> 01:21:03.175
Run.

947
01:21:19.108 --> 01:21:21.444
Step away from the door.

948
01:21:26.532 --> 01:21:27.825
We owe you for that.

949
01:21:30.077 --> 01:21:31.245
Just like new.

950
01:21:31.537 --> 01:21:32.997
Drop your weapon.

951
01:21:38.377 --> 01:21:40.212
- Stay with him.
- What about Neo?

952
01:21:40.379 --> 01:21:41.923
He can handle himself.

953
01:21:45.009 --> 01:21:46.093
Get in back.

954
01:22:23.756 --> 01:22:24.924
Shit.

955
01:22:25.424 --> 01:22:26.926
- Operator.
- Link, where am I?

956
01:22:27.468 --> 01:22:29.135
You're not going to believe this,

957
01:22:29.136 --> 01:22:30.930
but you're all the way
up in the mountains.

958
01:22:30.972 --> 01:22:31.980
Really?

959
01:22:31.981 --> 01:22:33.748
Yeah, it's going to take me
a while to get up an exit.

960
01:22:33.749 --> 01:22:34.851
- Oh shit.
- What?

961
01:22:35.017 --> 01:22:36.644
Those Twin things are after
Morpheus and Trinity

962
01:22:36.645 --> 01:22:37.912
and I don't have a
way to get them out.

963
01:22:37.913 --> 01:22:38.913
Where are they?

964
01:22:38.914 --> 01:22:40.400
Middle of the city,
500 miles due south.

965
01:22:57.999 --> 01:22:59.584
- Operator.
- Get us out of here Link.

966
01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:00.620
That won't be easy, sir.

967
01:23:00.621 --> 01:23:02.377
I know. We're inside
the core network.

968
01:23:02.380 --> 01:23:05.298
Yes sir. The only exit I got near
you is the Winslow overpass.

969
01:23:05.330 --> 01:23:06.330
Off the freeway.

970
01:23:06.331 --> 01:23:07.331
Yes, sir.

971
01:23:07.717 --> 01:23:08.968
Fine, we'll make it.

972
01:23:08.970 --> 01:23:10.928
Sir, I think I should say...
oh shit, look out behind you.

973
01:23:16.475 --> 01:23:18.060
- Incoming fire.
- Down.

974
01:23:26.319 --> 01:23:27.486
Hold on.

975
01:23:44.503 --> 01:23:47.006
Oh, no. This is getting
real ugly real fast.

976
01:23:47.173 --> 01:23:48.883
Are you watching this, Link?

977
01:23:49.050 --> 01:23:50.284
Yes sir, there's an
all-points on you,

978
01:23:50.285 --> 01:23:51.585
I mean 8 units headed your way.

979
01:23:53.721 --> 01:23:55.681
Any suggestions?

980
01:23:57.558 --> 01:23:59.560
- Turn right.
- Right, now.

981
01:24:06.985 --> 01:24:08.485
Now straight here, go
through the next branch,

982
01:24:08.486 --> 01:24:09.987
you'll hit a connecting
tunnel to the 101.

983
01:24:10.029 --> 01:24:11.405
- Got it.
- Sir, are you sure about this?

984
01:24:11.572 --> 01:24:12.850
The freeway, I mean.
It's dangerous,

985
01:24:12.851 --> 01:24:14.615
in 14 years of operating,
I've never seen...

986
01:24:14.617 --> 01:24:16.619
Link, what did I tell you?

987
01:24:16.911 --> 01:24:19.205
Yes, sir. I do, sir.
Winslow overpass.

988
01:24:19.372 --> 01:24:21.874
- I'll be ready for you.
- Good man.

989
01:24:22.041 --> 01:24:24.210
You always told me to
stay off the freeway.

990
01:24:24.377 --> 01:24:27.004
- Yes, that's true.
- You said it was suicide.

991
01:24:27.213 --> 01:24:29.131
Then let us hope...

992
01:24:29.298 --> 01:24:30.675
that I was wrong.

993
01:24:42.144 --> 01:24:43.646
- Operator.
- Link, it's Niobe.

994
01:24:43.813 --> 01:24:45.439
We've been sent to bring you in.

995
01:24:45.606 --> 01:24:48.293
- I need to talk to Morpheus.
- Believe me, Niobe, he needs you.

996
01:24:48.559 --> 01:24:50.900
- Where is he?
- Just follow the sirens.

997
01:24:58.411 --> 01:25:00.329
Repeat, they're approaching the-

998
01:25:03.499 --> 01:25:07.712
- We have them now.
- The exile is the primary target.

999
01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:12.400
Shots fired.

1000
01:26:14.946 --> 01:26:16.822
Move.

1001
01:28:06.807 --> 01:28:10.019
- We are getting aggravated.
- Yes, we are.

1002
01:28:56.065 --> 01:28:58.067
Trinity.

1003
01:28:58.484 --> 01:28:59.610
Get him out of here.

1004
01:29:03.239 --> 01:29:05.324
Come on.

1005
01:29:22.341 --> 01:29:23.843
Crush him.

1006
01:29:54.332 --> 01:29:55.374
Morpheus.

1007
01:29:55.541 --> 01:29:57.043
He's okay. Keep moving.

1008
01:29:58.044 --> 01:29:59.837
Let's go.

1009
01:30:05.593 --> 01:30:07.762
I need a download to
hot-wire a motorcycle.

1010
01:30:07.929 --> 01:30:10.264
Not a problem, one crash
course in motorcycle...

1011
01:30:10.431 --> 01:30:11.849
Wait.

1012
01:30:13.225 --> 01:30:14.685
Cancel that.

1013
01:30:14.852 --> 01:30:17.063
You are handy.

1014
01:30:17.229 --> 01:30:19.148
Jump on.

1015
01:32:46.545 --> 01:32:48.464
- She means nothing.
- Find the exile.

1016
01:32:49.715 --> 01:32:50.758
We have them.

1017
01:32:51.092 --> 01:32:53.219
One-Adam-twelve, please respond.

1018
01:32:59.684 --> 01:33:01.394
Get down.

1019
01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:14.026
Gotcha.

1020
01:35:14.777 --> 01:35:15.861
She's good.

1021
01:35:20.241 --> 01:35:22.535
You are no longer necessary.

1022
01:35:29.208 --> 01:35:32.920
We do only what we're meant to do.

1023
01:35:34.547 --> 01:35:36.670
Then you are meant
for one more thing:

1024
01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:38.500
Deletion.

1025
01:35:39.093 --> 01:35:40.970
Go kick his ass.

1026
01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:33.773
Neo, if you're out there,
I could use some help.

1027
01:36:34.523 --> 01:36:35.983
What is that?

1028
01:37:05.846 --> 01:37:08.724
Yes. Yes.

1029
01:37:15.314 --> 01:37:17.858
Sir, we have confirmation
from the Icarus.

1030
01:37:18.025 --> 01:37:20.444
The first two ships are in
position for the counter-attack.

1031
01:37:20.695 --> 01:37:21.737
Good.

1032
01:37:22.738 --> 01:37:23.781
Any change?

1033
01:37:23.948 --> 01:37:26.001
Looks like they hit
some iron ore here,

1034
01:37:26.002 --> 01:37:27.152
slowed them down a little.

1035
01:37:27.167 --> 01:37:29.996
- How much?
- An hour, maybe.

1036
01:37:30.162 --> 01:37:32.707
That would give them a
little over nine hours.

1037
01:37:33.541 --> 01:37:35.167
Yes, sir.

1038
01:38:07.783 --> 01:38:10.036
There is a building.

1039
01:38:10.202 --> 01:38:12.975
Inside this building,
there is a level

1040
01:38:12.976 --> 01:38:15.020
where no elevator can go

1041
01:38:16.042 --> 01:38:17.960
and no stair can reach.

1042
01:38:18.628 --> 01:38:21.317
This level is filled with doors.

1043
01:38:21.318 --> 01:38:23.830
These doors lead to many places.

1044
01:38:24.584 --> 01:38:27.219
Hidden places.

1045
01:38:27.553 --> 01:38:31.182
But one door is special.

1046
01:38:31.349 --> 01:38:33.875
One door leads to the Source.

1047
01:38:41.901 --> 01:38:46.322
This building is protected
by a very secure system.

1048
01:38:46.489 --> 01:38:50.993
- Every alarm triggers the bomb.
- Bomb? Did he say bomb?

1049
01:38:51.244 --> 01:38:53.913
But like all systems,
it has a weakness.

1050
01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:57.083
The system is based on
the rules of a building.

1051
01:38:57.250 --> 01:39:00.628
- One system built on another.
- Electricity.

1052
01:39:01.170 --> 01:39:05.800
- If one fails, so must the other.
- No electricity, no alarms.

1053
01:39:05.825 --> 01:39:07.385
But you'd have to take
out a whole city block

1054
01:39:07.388 --> 01:39:09.094
to kill the power to a
building like that.

1055
01:39:09.095 --> 01:39:12.807
- Not one, 27.
- 27 blocks?

1056
01:39:13.641 --> 01:39:16.102
There is a power station.

1057
01:39:16.269 --> 01:39:18.521
It must be destroyed.

1058
01:39:18.688 --> 01:39:20.500
There must be some
kind of fail-safe.

1059
01:39:20.501 --> 01:39:23.250
Yes, there is an emergency system.

1060
01:39:24.652 --> 01:39:28.447
The core network of the
grid must be accessed.

1061
01:39:28.614 --> 01:39:31.450
The emergency system
must be deactivated.

1062
01:39:31.617 --> 01:39:33.035
Then what do you need us for?

1063
01:39:33.202 --> 01:39:35.471
Neo could take them both
out easier than we could.

1064
01:39:35.538 --> 01:39:37.290
- There's no time.
- Why?

1065
01:39:37.456 --> 01:39:40.585
Once the door is unprotected,
the connection will be severed.

1066
01:39:40.751 --> 01:39:43.045
But another connection
must first be made.

1067
01:39:43.879 --> 01:39:47.717
- How long will that take?
- Exactly 314 seconds.

1068
01:39:47.883 --> 01:39:49.468
Just over five minutes.

1069
01:39:49.635 --> 01:39:51.887
That is the length and
breadth of the window.

1070
01:39:52.054 --> 01:39:54.348
Only the One can open the door,

1071
01:39:54.557 --> 01:39:57.476
and only during that window
can the door be opened.

1072
01:39:58.728 --> 01:40:00.313
How do you know all this?

1073
01:40:00.479 --> 01:40:04.251
I know because I must
know. It is my purpose.

1074
01:40:05.818 --> 01:40:11.324
It's the reason I'm here, the
same reason we're all here.

1075
01:40:22.084 --> 01:40:24.879
Neo, I know something's wrong.

1076
01:40:25.546 --> 01:40:27.590
You don't have to tell me.

1077
01:40:27.757 --> 01:40:31.510
I just want you to
know that I'm here.

1078
01:40:35.056 --> 01:40:36.515
All must be done as one.

1079
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:42.939
Can't hurt.

1080
01:40:46.484 --> 01:40:48.569
If one fails...

1081
01:40:49.362 --> 01:40:51.072
all fail.

1082
01:40:51.405 --> 01:40:53.377
At midnight, there
is a shift change

1083
01:40:53.378 --> 01:40:55.243
in the security of both buildings.

1084
01:40:56.452 --> 01:40:59.872
At midnight, we will strike.

1085
01:41:00.498 --> 01:41:01.582
Hey.

1086
01:41:01.749 --> 01:41:03.384
You count sheep at home.

1087
01:41:03.385 --> 01:41:05.711
Why? I get paid to
count them here.

1088
01:41:15.888 --> 01:41:18.099
Okay, they're inside.

1089
01:41:18.266 --> 01:41:20.768
- How much time?
- Twelve minutes.

1090
01:41:23.479 --> 01:41:24.564
Oh, shit.

1091
01:41:27.942 --> 01:41:31.106
All of our lives, we
have fought this war.

1092
01:41:31.930 --> 01:41:33.807
Tonight, I believe we can end it.

1093
01:41:34.907 --> 01:41:37.076
Tonight is not an accident.

1094
01:41:38.411 --> 01:41:40.413
There are no accidents.

1095
01:41:41.789 --> 01:41:43.815
We have not come here by chance.

1096
01:41:43.816 --> 01:41:46.736
I do not believe in chance.

1097
01:41:47.003 --> 01:41:52.592
When I see three objectives,
three captains, three ships,

1098
01:41:52.758 --> 01:41:56.262
I do not see coincidence.
I see providence.

1099
01:41:56.596 --> 01:41:58.931
I see purpose.

1100
01:42:01.642 --> 01:42:04.850
I believe it is our
fate to be here.

1101
01:42:05.151 --> 01:42:08.000
It is our destiny.

1102
01:42:08.149 --> 01:42:13.154
I believe this night holds
for each and every one of us

1103
01:42:13.321 --> 01:42:16.657
the very meaning of our lives.

1104
01:42:16.824 --> 01:42:18.365
I want to ask you to do something,

1105
01:42:18.366 --> 01:42:19.566
but I don't know how.

1106
01:42:21.579 --> 01:42:23.497
I promise you, if I can, I will.

1107
01:42:24.832 --> 01:42:28.169
What if I asked you
to stay out of this,

1108
01:42:29.128 --> 01:42:31.130
no matter what,

1109
01:42:31.297 --> 01:42:33.633
to stay out of the Matrix?

1110
01:42:34.717 --> 01:42:36.510
Why?

1111
01:42:44.727 --> 01:42:45.811
Please.

1112
01:42:47.897 --> 01:42:49.232
All right.

1113
01:42:52.568 --> 01:42:55.071
What is it, Niobe?

1114
01:42:55.238 --> 01:42:56.667
I can't help it, Morpheus.

1115
01:42:56.668 --> 01:42:59.410
I can't help thinking,
what if you're wrong?

1116
01:42:59.533 --> 01:43:02.828
What if all this, the prophecy,
everything, is bullshit?

1117
01:43:02.995 --> 01:43:06.999
Then tomorrow we may all be dead.

1118
01:43:07.416 --> 01:43:10.044
But how would that be
different from any other day?

1119
01:43:19.512 --> 01:43:26.018
This is a war, and
we are soldiers.

1120
01:43:26.269 --> 01:43:29.188
Death can come for us at any time,

1121
01:43:29.730 --> 01:43:31.524
in any place.

1122
01:43:31.691 --> 01:43:33.609
Incoming. Incoming.

1123
01:43:35.570 --> 01:43:37.196
Incoming.

1124
01:43:43.119 --> 01:43:45.580
Now consider the alternative.

1125
01:43:45.746 --> 01:43:50.334
What if I am right? What
if the prophecy is true?

1126
01:43:50.501 --> 01:43:54.922
What if tomorrow the
war could be over?

1127
01:43:55.881 --> 01:43:58.884
Isn't that worth fighting for?

1128
01:44:00.011 --> 01:44:02.638
Isn't that worth dying for?

1129
01:44:03.556 --> 01:44:06.183
- Time?
- Three minutes.

1130
01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:07.476
Almost there.

1131
01:44:27.538 --> 01:44:28.915
It is time.

1132
01:44:29.081 --> 01:44:30.374
Find the others.

1133
01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:33.753
Got Niobe right there, they're
already out of the station.

1134
01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:36.589
- What about Soren?
- There.

1135
01:44:36.756 --> 01:44:38.591
They're still inside, but...

1136
01:44:39.467 --> 01:44:40.509
They're not moving.

1137
01:45:04.659 --> 01:45:06.577
That's it, let's go.

1138
01:45:08.704 --> 01:45:10.539
Call Neo now.

1139
01:45:14.502 --> 01:45:16.338
I lost them. They're
inside the portal.

1140
01:45:16.339 --> 01:45:17.339
What about the grid?

1141
01:45:21.467 --> 01:45:22.920
Everything's still operational.

1142
01:45:22.921 --> 01:45:25.221
Emergency system's already
rerouteing power.

1143
01:45:30.643 --> 01:45:32.812
Jesus.

1144
01:45:32.979 --> 01:45:37.024
As soon as they open that
door, it's all over.

1145
01:45:37.191 --> 01:45:39.151
The hell it is.

1146
01:45:39.902 --> 01:45:41.237
What are you? Trinity.

1147
01:45:42.330 --> 01:45:44.050
I will not stand
here and do nothing.

1148
01:45:44.051 --> 01:45:45.790
I will not wait here
to watch them die.

1149
01:45:45.795 --> 01:45:47.827
Trinity, we're talking
less then 5 minutes here.

1150
01:45:47.994 --> 01:45:50.496
In 5 minutes, I'll tear that
whole goddamn building down.

1151
01:45:50.663 --> 01:45:54.208
- How much further?
- Here, just here.

1152
01:45:55.501 --> 01:45:59.505
I'm sorry, this is a dead end.

1153
01:46:00.673 --> 01:46:03.175
It's got to be the ugliest
hack I have ever done.

1154
01:46:06.387 --> 01:46:09.515
That's as close as I can get ya.
You better grow some wings.

1155
01:46:27.575 --> 01:46:29.160
- Operator.
- I'm in.

1156
01:46:29.327 --> 01:46:31.495
Keep moving. Sixty-fifth floor.

1157
01:46:32.079 --> 01:46:36.400
You look surprised to see
me again, Mr Anderson.

1158
01:46:36.417 --> 01:46:39.230
Well, that's the
difference between us.

1159
01:46:39.231 --> 01:46:41.831
I have been expecting you.

1160
01:46:41.964 --> 01:46:44.884
- What do you want, Smith?
- Oh you haven't figured that out?

1161
01:46:45.051 --> 01:46:50.556
Still using all the muscles
except the one that matters.

1162
01:46:50.723 --> 01:46:53.392
I want exactly what you want.

1163
01:46:53.559 --> 01:46:55.645
I want everything.

1164
01:46:56.103 --> 01:46:58.606
Would that include a
bullet from this gun?

1165
01:46:58.773 --> 01:47:00.566
Go ahead, shoot.

1166
01:47:00.733 --> 01:47:06.030
The best thing about being
me... there's so many me.

1167
01:47:17.416 --> 01:47:21.045
Christ. What the hell
happened in here?

1168
01:47:21.921 --> 01:47:23.965
Hold it right there, little lady.

1169
01:47:33.307 --> 01:47:35.101
If you can't beat us...

1170
01:47:35.268 --> 01:47:37.103
Join us.

1171
01:47:39.272 --> 01:47:40.356
Morpheus.

1172
01:47:53.953 --> 01:47:55.078
Still no sight of them.

1173
01:47:55.079 --> 01:47:57.246
I don't know what they're doing,
but they only got 2 minutes left.

1174
01:48:10.761 --> 01:48:11.846
One minute.

1175
01:48:21.105 --> 01:48:22.148
Come on.

1176
01:48:23.316 --> 01:48:25.234
Come on.

1177
01:48:25.818 --> 01:48:27.695
Please.

1178
01:48:37.622 --> 01:48:39.165
Kill them.

1179
01:48:47.048 --> 01:48:48.090
They're in.

1180
01:48:48.257 --> 01:48:50.217
I don't believe it.

1181
01:49:05.775 --> 01:49:07.902
It was meant to be.

1182
01:49:08.069 --> 01:49:13.449
Morpheus, that door
will take you home.

1183
01:49:22.208 --> 01:49:26.545
You will know which
door. Hurry, Neo.

1184
01:49:32.051 --> 01:49:35.221
Trinity, I got some serious
activity headed your way.

1185
01:50:27.523 --> 01:50:28.900
Hello, Neo.

1186
01:50:29.442 --> 01:50:33.237
- Who are you?
- I am the Architect.

1187
01:50:33.404 --> 01:50:37.033
I created the Matrix. I've
been waiting for you.

1188
01:50:37.283 --> 01:50:39.029
You have many questions

1189
01:50:39.030 --> 01:50:41.554
and though the process has
altered your consciousness

1190
01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:43.623
you remain irrevocably human.

1191
01:50:43.789 --> 01:50:45.995
Ergo, some of my answers
you will understand

1192
01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.460
and some of them you will not.

1193
01:50:47.739 --> 01:50:48.739
Concordantly,

1194
01:50:48.740 --> 01:50:51.840
while your first question
may be the most pertinent,

1195
01:50:52.006 --> 01:50:55.718
you may or may not realise it
is also the most irrelevant.

1196
01:50:56.594 --> 01:50:58.220
Why am I here?

1197
01:50:58.387 --> 01:50:59.387
Your life

1198
01:50:59.388 --> 01:51:02.476
is the sum of a remainder
of an unbalanced equation

1199
01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:04.810
inherent to the programming
of the Matrix.

1200
01:51:04.977 --> 01:51:07.550
You are the eventuality
of an anomaly,

1201
01:51:07.551 --> 01:51:09.340
which despite my sincerest efforts

1202
01:51:09.342 --> 01:51:12.068
I've been unable to eliminate
from what is otherwise

1203
01:51:12.235 --> 01:51:15.397
a harmony of
mathematical precision.

1204
01:51:17.031 --> 01:51:19.400
While it remains a burden
assiduously avoided

1205
01:51:19.403 --> 01:51:23.996
it is not unexpected and thus not
beyond a measure of control,

1206
01:51:24.163 --> 01:51:26.925
which has led you, inexorably...

1207
01:51:29.085 --> 01:51:30.336
Here.

1208
01:51:30.503 --> 01:51:33.388
You haven't answered my question.

1209
01:51:33.389 --> 01:51:34.590
Quite right.

1210
01:51:34.757 --> 01:51:38.552
Interesting. That was
quicker than the others.

1211
01:51:38.719 --> 01:51:41.500
Others? How many others? What
others? Answer my question.

1212
01:51:41.514 --> 01:51:43.849
The Matrix is older than you know.

1213
01:51:44.016 --> 01:51:47.350
I prefer counting from the
emergence of one integral anomaly

1214
01:51:47.353 --> 01:51:48.480
to the emergence of the next.

1215
01:51:48.481 --> 01:51:50.781
In which case, this
is the sixth version.

1216
01:51:50.783 --> 01:51:52.534
Five ones before me?
He's lying. Bullshit.

1217
01:51:53.601 --> 01:51:55.446
There are only two
possible explanations.

1218
01:51:55.447 --> 01:51:56.947
There were five ones before me.

1219
01:51:57.113 --> 01:51:58.406
Either no one told me...

1220
01:51:59.657 --> 01:52:01.061
Or no one knows.

1221
01:52:01.740 --> 01:52:02.740
Precisely.

1222
01:52:03.828 --> 01:52:05.500
As you are undoubtedly gathering,

1223
01:52:05.501 --> 01:52:07.001
the anomaly is systemic,

1224
01:52:07.290 --> 01:52:10.710
creating fluctuations in even
the most simplistic equations.

1225
01:52:10.716 --> 01:52:13.280
You can't control me. I'm
going to smash you to bits.

1226
01:52:14.297 --> 01:52:16.090
I'm going to fucking kill you.

1227
01:52:16.257 --> 01:52:19.427
You can't make me do anything.
You old, white prick.

1228
01:52:21.721 --> 01:52:23.222
Choice.

1229
01:52:23.389 --> 01:52:25.224
The problem is choice.

1230
01:52:47.455 --> 01:52:49.960
The first Matrix I designed
was quite naturally perfect,

1231
01:52:49.961 --> 01:52:51.261
it was a work of art.

1232
01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:53.085
Flawless, sublime.

1233
01:52:53.252 --> 01:52:56.756
A triumph equalled only by
its monumental failure.

1234
01:52:57.423 --> 01:52:59.942
The inevitability of its
doom is apparent to me now

1235
01:52:59.950 --> 01:53:01.400
as a consequence of
the imperfection

1236
01:53:01.401 --> 01:53:03.401
inherent in every human being.

1237
01:53:03.512 --> 01:53:06.474
Thus, I redesigned it
based on your history,

1238
01:53:06.641 --> 01:53:08.035
to more accurately reflect

1239
01:53:08.036 --> 01:53:10.660
the varying grotesqueries
of your nature.

1240
01:53:11.354 --> 01:53:15.441
However, I was again
frustrated by failure.

1241
01:53:16.817 --> 01:53:18.325
I have since come to understand

1242
01:53:18.326 --> 01:53:19.426
that the answer eluded me

1243
01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:21.525
because it required a lesser mind.

1244
01:53:21.530 --> 01:53:22.530
Or perhaps,

1245
01:53:22.531 --> 01:53:25.801
a mind less bound by the
parameters of perfection.

1246
01:53:27.954 --> 01:53:30.475
Thus, the answer was
stumbled upon by another,

1247
01:53:30.476 --> 01:53:32.276
an intuitive program,

1248
01:53:32.541 --> 01:53:34.800
initially created to investigate

1249
01:53:34.801 --> 01:53:37.230
certain aspects of
the human psyche.

1250
01:53:37.505 --> 01:53:40.369
If I am the father of the Matrix,

1251
01:53:40.670 --> 01:53:43.420
she would undoubtedly
be its mother.

1252
01:53:44.095 --> 01:53:46.389
- The Oracle.
- Please.

1253
01:53:46.889 --> 01:53:49.283
As I was saying, she
stumbled upon a solution

1254
01:53:49.290 --> 01:53:51.635
whereby nearly 99 percent
of all test subjects

1255
01:53:51.636 --> 01:53:54.272
accepted the program, as long
as they were given a choice,

1256
01:53:54.280 --> 01:53:55.880
even if they were only
aware of the choice

1257
01:53:55.881 --> 01:53:57.481
at a near unconscious level.

1258
01:53:58.609 --> 01:53:59.760
While this answer functioned,

1259
01:53:59.761 --> 01:54:02.061
it was obviously
fundamentally flawed,

1260
01:54:02.096 --> 01:54:06.200
thus creating the otherwise
contradictory systemic anomaly

1261
01:54:06.367 --> 01:54:09.078
that if left unchecked might
threaten the system itself.

1262
01:54:09.453 --> 01:54:11.960
Ergo those that
refused the program,

1263
01:54:11.961 --> 01:54:13.700
while a minority, if unchecked,

1264
01:54:13.749 --> 01:54:17.837
would constitute an escalating
probability of disaster.

1265
01:54:18.004 --> 01:54:19.797
This is about Zion.

1266
01:54:20.256 --> 01:54:23.926
You are here because Zion
is about to be destroyed.

1267
01:54:24.093 --> 01:54:26.085
Its every living
inhabitant terminated,

1268
01:54:26.086 --> 01:54:28.500
its entire existence eradicated.

1269
01:54:28.806 --> 01:54:29.849
Bullshit.

1270
01:54:30.016 --> 01:54:33.185
Denial is the most predictable
of all human responses.

1271
01:54:33.394 --> 01:54:35.400
But rest assured,

1272
01:54:36.001 --> 01:54:39.701
this will be the sixth
time we have destroyed it,

1273
01:54:40.026 --> 01:54:44.030
and we have become
exceedingly efficient at it.

1274
01:54:56.751 --> 01:54:58.265
The function of the One

1275
01:54:58.270 --> 01:55:00.000
is now to return to the Source,

1276
01:55:00.001 --> 01:55:03.020
allowing a temporary dissemination
of the code you carry,

1277
01:55:03.025 --> 01:55:04.759
reinserting the prime program.

1278
01:55:05.343 --> 01:55:08.060
After which, you will be required
to select from the Matrix

1279
01:55:08.061 --> 01:55:10.780
twenty-three individuals,
sixteen female, seven male,

1280
01:55:10.783 --> 01:55:12.767
to rebuild Zion.

1281
01:55:12.934 --> 01:55:14.980
Failure to comply
with this process

1282
01:55:14.981 --> 01:55:17.671
will result in a
cataclysmic system crash,

1283
01:55:17.677 --> 01:55:19.982
killing everyone
connected to the Matrix.

1284
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:22.465
Which, coupled with the
extermination of Zion

1285
01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:24.500
will ultimately result
in the extinction

1286
01:55:24.501 --> 01:55:26.901
of the entire human race.

1287
01:55:27.448 --> 01:55:29.300
You won't let it
happen. You can't.

1288
01:55:29.301 --> 01:55:31.210
You need human beings to survive.

1289
01:55:32.328 --> 01:55:35.957
There are levels of survival
we are prepared to accept.

1290
01:55:36.123 --> 01:55:37.722
However, the relevant issue is

1291
01:55:37.723 --> 01:55:40.383
whether or not you are ready
to accept the responsibility

1292
01:55:40.385 --> 01:55:42.672
for the death of every
human being in this world.

1293
01:55:49.136 --> 01:55:51.681
It is interesting
reading your reactions.

1294
01:55:52.723 --> 01:55:55.161
Your five predecessors
were, by design,

1295
01:55:55.162 --> 01:55:58.490
based on a similar predication,
a contingent affirmation,

1296
01:55:58.537 --> 01:56:01.330
that was meant to create
a profound attachment

1297
01:56:01.333 --> 01:56:02.525
to the rest of your species,

1298
01:56:02.526 --> 01:56:04.470
facilitating the
function of the One.

1299
01:56:05.111 --> 01:56:07.446
While the others experienced
this in a very general way,

1300
01:56:07.613 --> 01:56:10.575
your experience is
far more specific,

1301
01:56:10.908 --> 01:56:13.786
vis-à-vis love.

1302
01:56:14.787 --> 01:56:16.414
Trinity.

1303
01:56:18.708 --> 01:56:21.545
Apropos, she entered the
Matrix to save your life

1304
01:56:21.546 --> 01:56:22.980
at the cost of her own.

1305
01:56:23.421 --> 01:56:24.463
No.

1306
01:56:25.172 --> 01:56:27.900
Which brings us at last
to the moment of truth,

1307
01:56:27.901 --> 01:56:31.260
wherein the fundamental flaw
is ultimately expressed

1308
01:56:31.268 --> 01:56:35.800
and the anomaly revealed
as both beginning and end.

1309
01:56:36.893 --> 01:56:38.394
There are two doors.

1310
01:56:38.561 --> 01:56:40.500
The door to your right
leads to the Source

1311
01:56:40.501 --> 01:56:42.001
and the salvation of Zion.

1312
01:56:42.523 --> 01:56:44.800
The door to your left
leads back to the Matrix,

1313
01:56:44.801 --> 01:56:47.860
to her and to the end
of your species.

1314
01:56:48.988 --> 01:56:53.367
As you adequately put,
the problem is choice.

1315
01:56:53.534 --> 01:56:57.038
But we already know what you
are going to do, don't we?

1316
01:56:57.204 --> 01:56:59.480
Already I can see
the chain reaction,

1317
01:56:59.481 --> 01:57:03.550
the chemical precursors that
signal the onset of an emotion,

1318
01:57:03.577 --> 01:57:06.714
designed specifically to
overwhelm logic and reason.

1319
01:57:06.881 --> 01:57:09.190
An emotion that is
already blinding you

1320
01:57:09.191 --> 01:57:11.191
from the simple and obvious truth:

1321
01:57:11.677 --> 01:57:13.725
She is going to die

1322
01:57:13.726 --> 01:57:16.726
and there is nothing
you can do to stop it.

1323
01:57:23.110 --> 01:57:24.110
Hope.

1324
01:57:24.111 --> 01:57:26.490
It is the quintessential
human delusion,

1325
01:57:26.491 --> 01:57:29.280
simultaneously the source
of your greatest strength

1326
01:57:29.285 --> 01:57:31.197
and your greatest weakness.

1327
01:57:31.364 --> 01:57:35.701
If I were you, I would hope
that we don't meet again.

1328
01:57:35.868 --> 01:57:37.286
We won't.

1329
01:57:44.710 --> 01:57:46.921
We got a serious situation, sir.

1330
01:57:47.380 --> 01:57:48.464
Oh, no.

1331
01:58:48.107 --> 01:58:49.109
What was that?

1332
01:58:49.110 --> 01:58:51.810
Whatever it is, it's moving faster
than anything I've ever seen.

1333
01:59:42.286 --> 01:59:44.080
Holy shit, he caught her.

1334
01:59:58.010 --> 01:59:59.845
Neo, I had to.

1335
02:00:00.012 --> 02:00:01.764
I know.

1336
02:00:06.811 --> 02:00:09.355
The bullet is still inside.

1337
02:00:20.116 --> 02:00:22.034
Trinity,

1338
02:00:23.244 --> 02:00:24.954
don't you quit on me now.

1339
02:00:34.130 --> 02:00:36.716
I'm sorry.

1340
02:00:43.222 --> 02:00:45.516
Trinity.

1341
02:00:55.484 --> 02:00:57.445
Trinity,

1342
02:00:57.612 --> 02:00:59.405
I know you can hear me.

1343
02:01:00.197 --> 02:01:02.742
I'm not letting go.

1344
02:01:02.909 --> 02:01:04.535
I can't.

1345
02:01:05.745 --> 02:01:07.955
I love you too damn much.

1346
02:01:36.651 --> 02:01:37.944
I can't take this.

1347
02:01:41.697 --> 02:01:44.784
I guess this makes us even.

1348
02:01:57.463 --> 02:01:59.423
I don't understand it.

1349
02:01:59.590 --> 02:02:02.593
Everything was done as it
was supposed to be done.

1350
02:02:02.760 --> 02:02:04.750
Once the One reaches the Source,

1351
02:02:04.751 --> 02:02:06.051
the war should be over.

1352
02:02:06.072 --> 02:02:08.808
- In 24 hours, it will be.
- What?

1353
02:02:08.975 --> 02:02:11.133
If we don't do
something in 24 hours,

1354
02:02:11.634 --> 02:02:13.134
Zion will be destroyed.

1355
02:02:13.729 --> 02:02:15.356
- What?
- How do you know that?

1356
02:02:15.815 --> 02:02:17.858
- I was told it would happen.
- By whom?

1357
02:02:18.859 --> 02:02:21.696
It doesn't matter. I believed him.

1358
02:02:21.862 --> 02:02:23.715
That's impossible. The
prophecy tells us...

1359
02:02:23.716 --> 02:02:25.016
It was a lie, Morpheus.

1360
02:02:27.451 --> 02:02:29.996
The prophecy was a lie.

1361
02:02:31.205 --> 02:02:34.208
The One was never meant
to end anything.

1362
02:02:34.375 --> 02:02:37.420
It was all another
system of control.

1363
02:02:37.587 --> 02:02:40.673
I don't believe that.

1364
02:02:41.007 --> 02:02:43.342
But you said it yourself.

1365
02:02:43.509 --> 02:02:47.513
How can the prophecy be
true if the war isn't over?

1366
02:02:53.686 --> 02:02:56.147
I'm sorry.

1367
02:02:56.314 --> 02:02:58.130
I know it isn't easy
to hear, but...

1368
02:02:59.859 --> 02:03:03.029
I swear to you it's the truth.

1369
02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:08.951
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know.

1370
02:03:11.162 --> 02:03:12.371
Oh, no.

1371
02:03:21.714 --> 02:03:25.051
- What are they doing?
- They're just out of EMP range.

1372
02:03:25.551 --> 02:03:26.802
It's a bomb.

1373
02:03:27.970 --> 02:03:30.181
We have to get out of here. Now.

1374
02:04:06.884 --> 02:04:08.761
I have dreamt a dream,

1375
02:04:11.806 --> 02:04:15.184
and now that dream
has gone from me.

1376
02:04:26.237 --> 02:04:28.489
Here they come.

1377
02:04:28.739 --> 02:04:30.449
Let's go, Morpheus.

1378
02:04:31.867 --> 02:04:34.912
- We won't make it.
- We have to try.

1379
02:04:42.628 --> 02:04:45.631
- Come on.
- Something's different.

1380
02:04:45.798 --> 02:04:47.800
What?

1381
02:04:48.467 --> 02:04:49.969
I can feel them.

1382
02:05:12.909 --> 02:05:14.493
Neo.

1383
02:05:20.666 --> 02:05:24.253
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1384
02:05:29.508 --> 02:05:31.427
It's the Hammer.

1385
02:05:43.105 --> 02:05:45.816
He's in some kind of coma,

1386
02:05:45.983 --> 02:05:48.236
but his vitals are stable.

1387
02:05:49.445 --> 02:05:51.364
What about you?

1388
02:05:51.530 --> 02:05:53.658
I'm fine.

1389
02:05:53.824 --> 02:05:56.202
You could use some rest.

1390
02:05:56.369 --> 02:05:58.204
No, I'm going to stay with him.

1391
02:06:05.294 --> 02:06:07.922
Lock was right. He guessed
that the machines

1392
02:06:08.089 --> 02:06:11.111
would cut off the mainlines
in and out of Zion.

1393
02:06:11.133 --> 02:06:13.886
He thought a counter-attack
might surprise them.

1394
02:06:14.136 --> 02:06:17.557
It sounded good. I
figured we had a shot,

1395
02:06:17.890 --> 02:06:20.300
until someone screwed it up.

1396
02:06:20.401 --> 02:06:23.229
An EMP was triggered before
we could get in position.

1397
02:06:23.396 --> 02:06:25.465
Five ships were instantly downed.

1398
02:06:25.466 --> 02:06:27.400
When the machines broke through,

1399
02:06:27.401 --> 02:06:30.611
it wasn't a battle,
it was a slaughter.

1400
02:06:30.778 --> 02:06:33.614
Was it an accident? Some
sort of malfunction?

1401
02:06:33.781 --> 02:06:36.242
- No one knows.
- Someone does.

1402
02:06:36.409 --> 02:06:38.160
Who?

1403
02:06:38.327 --> 02:06:40.370
Once the machines
were done with us,

1404
02:06:40.371 --> 02:06:41.771
they started digging again.

1405
02:06:42.206 --> 02:06:44.725
We made a quick pass
to look for survivors.

1406
02:06:44.730 --> 02:06:45.793
You found one?

1407
02:06:47.545 --> 02:06:49.255
Only one.
