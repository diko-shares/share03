00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:28,286
In the event a minor commits a serious
criminal offense...

2
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:32,794
police authorities may seek to shield
the minor's family...

3
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:36,801
from excessive media scrutiny
and public hostility.

4
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:41,306
This protection is given to prevent members
of the accused's family...

5
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:45,811
from taking their own lives
in response to the trauma.

6
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:49,473
Such suicides have occurred in the past.

7
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:53,382
Authorities have not admitted to
this practice.

8
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:45,089
"Nobody to Watch Over Me"

9
00:03:50,230 --> 00:04:00,128
January 24, 3:25 p.m.

10
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:06,705
Thank you for waiting.

11
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:16,788
I'll get your change.

12
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,220
You could buy love for that.

13
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,526
Quiet.

14
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,427
It's so not you.

15
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,370
It's for my daughter.

16
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:38,675
You'd score more points buying that
for your wife.

17
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,578
Precisely why it's for my daughter.
Now shut up.

18
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:49,150
Mishima

19
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,387
Get my change.

20
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,733
Katsuura-san!

21
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,806
Where've you been hiding?

22
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:12,671
You're looking good.
Been eating well? Prospering?

23
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,442
Not so fast.

24
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,553
I've been looking for you, Toru.

25
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:24,179
Know that new Indian restaurant?

26
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,656
Yeah... I mean, no.

27
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,558
You had the nice folks in tears.

28
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,153
I don't know it.

29
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:36,031
Why don't we talk at my place?

30
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,295
It' II be fun.

31
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,098
I'd rather not.

32
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,663
Then stay away from that shop.

33
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,571
I will.

34
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,447
OK, Mishima. Release him.

35
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,309
Back to your river.

36
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:55,377
Damn, I crushed it.

37
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,521
Precinct's calling.

38
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,463
Katsuura here.

39
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:19,678
You think we're needed for that
investigation that just opened?

40
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:23,014
No. It's not our division.

41
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:25,875
But we're being called in.

42
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,420
Not me. I'm off work in two days.

43
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:33,314
Family vacation, was it?

44
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:37,260
Possibly our last one.

45
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:38,421
Why's that?

46
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:44,293
My daughter tipped me off that my wife
has divorce papers ready.

47
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,898
My blood's curdling.

48
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,866
That explains the nice gift for
your daughter.

49
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,106
She's on my side.

50
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,408
She planned the trip to save the family.

51
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:59,709
That's touching. Can I ask her out?

52
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,783
If you have a death wish.

53
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,454
Now my blood's curdling.

54
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,082
I may be too late.

55
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:22,434
3:50 p.m.

56
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:30,038
Listen up! The guy that killed
two grade school sisters is only 18.

57
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,341
He's a minor.

58
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,717
Keep that in mind when covering this story.

59
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,024
You're late, Umemoto.

60
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,218
I caught my son's cold.

61
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,818
The teen was arrested in his home.

62
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,693
They're already live!

63
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,560
The two grade sisters were stabbed
to death...

64
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,001
in a nearby park last month.

65
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:57,074
Police are about to arrest an
18-year-old male.

66
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,841
We're outside his home.

67
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,412
Man, they're fast.

68
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,981
So go dig up something good.

69
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,606
I'll hit the victims' parents.

70
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:08,778
I already sent someone.
Check out the suspect's area.

71
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,755
Talk to his family, their friends.

72
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,422
The suspect's?

73
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:17,360
You broke a government scandal.
This should be easy.

74
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,426
Let's move.

75
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:22,928
I want final drafts in by 1:00 a.m.!

76
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,442
4:35 p.m.

77
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,206
"East Toshima Police Station"

78
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,576
The suspect's family?

79
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,774
Orders from Head of Investigations.

80
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,450
You're to protect the suspect's family.

81
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,618
Come again?

82
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:47,719
Why protect them?
Why not the victim's family?

83
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,954
Like I said, "orders."

84
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:55,529
What do we protect them from, Chief?

85
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:57,901
You'll see.

86
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:06,710
Chief! I put in a request for a vacation
starting day after tomorrow.

87
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,846
Cancel it.

88
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:10,541
I left good whiskey on your desk.

89
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:13,650
Where'd you get that?

90
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:17,046
It was forced on me. I don't take money.

91
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,984
This won't take two days. Let's go!

92
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:23,992
Chief!

93
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,530
If the trip is off...

94
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,132
the family is done for.

95
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,999
My blood's curdling.

96
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:50,189
5: 14 p.m.

97
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,123
What's this?

98
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:03,661
Moments ago, the man believed to have
murdered two school girls...

99
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:08,932
is an 18-year-old boy who lives with
his family in this home.

100
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,073
Word is he has just been arrested.

101
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:15,841
The 18-year-old boy has just been arrested.

102
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,777
This is what you protect against.

103
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:22,785
The media will prey on the suspect's family.

104
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:26,981
It could drive some to suicide.

105
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,991
But we need them alive for questioning.

106
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:31,530
Understood?

107
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:35,062
Coming through.

108
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:49,676
We're reporting live.
The front door just opened!

109
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,823
He's appeared! The suspect, the young man,
has appeared!

110
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,333
What was your motive?

111
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,033
Why'd you do it?

112
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,573
Apologize!

113
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,874
Did you target the sisters?

114
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,140
Did you know them?

115
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,846
Back door!

116
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:31,880
Hey, Mishima!

117
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,801
Violent Crime Division,
East Toshima Precinct here.

118
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,311
Good, we've been waiting.

119
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,911
Come in. Quickly.

120
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,832
Keep it down!

121
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:20,569
A complaint.

122
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,233
Disconnect the phone. And the doorbell.

123
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,478
Get me a screwdriver.

124
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,075
Not our boy!

125
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:36,712
It's not possible. This is ridiculous.

126
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:41,919
It's some kind of mistake!
Naoto wouldn't harm anyone.

127
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:45,622
Do you know what kind of life
your son was leading?

128
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:50,327
I was a strict parent.

129
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:00,879
How's it outside?

130
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,275
Swarming with press.

131
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,959
They're having a field day!

132
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,176
They've arrived.

133
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,446
I'm from Family Court.

134
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:36,981
Toshima Ward Office.

135
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:39,641
Hurry.

136
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:40,548
The daughter?

137
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,642
What's going on?

138
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:42,482
Saori.

139
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,351
Saori!

140
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,588
Please, dear.

141
00:13:55,935 --> 00:14:00,736
Before we begin the questioning,
please know that...

142
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:05,003
we're here to protect you
from the mass media onslaught.

143
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,338
Now, although your son is a minor...

144
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,915
it's possible his real name will be
made public.

145
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:16,317
You may be viewed as the "killer's family"
wherever you go.

146
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:20,688
We advise a divorce now to return your wife
to her maiden name.

147
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:21,589
Divorce?

148
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,458
Just as a prudent measure.

149
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:29,296
We've brought the papers for you to sign.

150
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,433
Now hold on a second.

151
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,697
Sign here.

152
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,170
Murderer!

153
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,638
Show yourself, Funamura!

154
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:37,868
Come out and apologize!

155
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,900
Sign here.

156
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,539
People furious with your son will follow you.

157
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,942
They'll follow you forever.

158
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,185
Okay, ma'am.

159
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:08,231
OK, the divorce is finalized.
Now for the new marriage registration.

160
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:12,771
We'll now enter the husband's name
on the wife's family register.

161
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,340
Sign here.

162
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,082
Ma'am, here.

163
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,421
On this line.

164
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,018
As "Ono", yes.

165
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:35,332
Your family name has been changed
from "Funamura" to "Ono."

166
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:41,270
Your son will remain on the old family
register. Sign here, please.

167
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,102
I'm from the Education Board. Sign this, too.

168
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,871
Ordinarily, court permission is required.

169
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:52,383
But the court approves this divorce
and marriage under a special provision.

170
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,014
That is all.

171
00:15:56,055 --> 00:16:01,118
The daughter, too, assumes her mother's
maiden name of "Ono."

172
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:03,558
Wait.

173
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:04,526
What is it?

174
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,927
What about my brother's name?

175
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:09,000
The police will announce it as "Funamura."

176
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,326
So he alone gets left with a different name?

177
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,639
He's family. We can't do that.

178
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:21,475
I'm afraid you can't attend school
for a while.

179
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:25,644
Why? Why can't I go to school?

180
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,685
I'll confirm the paperwork over there.

181
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:39,022
We will be separating you for
your own safety.

182
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:44,525
Take the father to the Tango Hotel
for questioning. Avoid the media.

183
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:49,369
Take the girl to the Felicity Hotel.
Don't forget a change of clothes.

184
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:52,000
A hotel? Not back to the precinct?

185
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,410
The media is already there.
We don't want them photographed.

186
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,004
Plus, they are not suspects.

187
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:03,848
Questioning a minor at the station
risks a civil rights infringement.

188
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,019
Understood.

189
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,421
Shall we go?

190
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:16,194
Mom, wait for him to come home.
Let's wait for him here.

191
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:17,966
Mom?

192
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,436
Your mother will help us search the house.

193
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,401
Mishima, get the car.

194
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,270
Get what you need.

195
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,938
No, I want to stay. I have to stay!

196
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,276
Mom!

197
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,316
There's no time.

198
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:32,916
No!

199
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:33,985
Mom!

200
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:37,246
Don't run off!
Apologize to the victims' family!

201
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:44,623
Who was in the car?

202
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:45,928
The father!

203
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,828
The others are leaving, too!

204
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,500
Where are they?

205
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:57,837
Umemoto-san! They're moving the family!

206
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:03,847
We're going to the car.

207
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:04,913
It's the sister!

208
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,185
Clear the way!

209
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:10,484
You're his sister, right?

210
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:16,255
Let us through!

211
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,493
Tell us about your brother!

212
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,587
Katsuura-san!

213
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,529
Clear the road!

214
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:24,966
Were you two close?

215
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,465
Tell us about him!

216
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,239
What was he like?

217
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,715
Just a word or two!

218
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:45,988
Mishima! Go!

219
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,518
Move!

220
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,096
I'll run you over!

221
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,466
Follow them!

222
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,908
I know that detective.

223
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,183
Media's on our tail. Lose them.

224
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:40,361
Mishima.

225
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:41,965
Damn!

226
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,687
Police! Close the lot!

227
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:43,886
"No Vacancy"

228
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:47,125
You're not full!

229
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:48,563
Open up!

230
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:08,351
We'll pay for any photo of the suspect!

231
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,077
10,000 yen!

232
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:16,119
Umemoto-san! Cop cars have been spotted
outside a Shinjuku hotel.

233
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,924
They must've moved the family there!

234
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,098
I've seen that detective before.

235
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:29,097
7:35 p.m.

236
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:40,380
9Room 930... 930.

237
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,656
Who is it?

238
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,659
Detective Katsuura.

239
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:52,720
Enter.

240
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,261
It's okay.

241
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,033
Have a seat.

242
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,438
Sit here.

243
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:11,710
What?

244
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,978
Just some questions.

245
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,952
What do you remember about Thursday,
December 6?

246
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,716
That morning.

247
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,655
Did your brother speak to you?

248
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,020
Try to remember!

249
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:27,621
Open up!

250
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,524
We know she's in there. Let us talk to her!

251
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,260
What now?

252
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:34,702
Get her out and call us later.

253
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,000
Mishima!

254
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:38,198
Let's go.

255
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,541
What're you doing?

256
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:48,245
Move aside!

257
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,181
Let us interview her!

258
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:51,780
Give her room.

259
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:53,288
Why the escort?

260
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:54,449
Hey, watch it!

261
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,962
- What's her brother like?
- How should I know?

262
00:24:58,063 --> 00:24:59,530
People want to know!

263
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:01,626
No photos!

264
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,171
Why take photos of me?

265
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:23,220
They'll hound you forever, remember?

266
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,764
Gotcha.

267
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,732
Head toward Suginami Ward.

268
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,432
Yes, Sir.

269
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:48,772
We're going to your relatives.
They'll hide you.

270
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,581
"Random Stabbing in Ikebukuro"

271
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:35,789
Hey, Sayama!

272
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:42,899
I need a cop's address.

273
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:44,663
I'll try.

274
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:48,638
I think I can get an interview with the cop
who took the girl.

275
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:57,948
9:30 p.m.

276
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:02,081
Not here, too.

277
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:03,986
Auntie?

278
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,114
Hello? Katsuura here.

279
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:09,218
We can't go to the relatives.

280
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,429
What?

281
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:13,928
Where now?

282
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:14,964
Don't know yet.

283
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,826
They want you back at the house.

284
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:21,467
They're shorthanded.

285
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,000
What about her?

286
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:53,270
Come.

287
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:54,338
Where are we?

288
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:56,065
Get out.

289
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:05,806
10:08 p.m.

290
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,685
This is your place?

291
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,156
Come in.

292
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,830
Quickly! Don't just stand there.

293
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:41,650
Inside.

294
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:55,694
This is Katsuura. Where do I take the sister?

295
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,065
We're looking. Hide until we call you.

296
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:02,663
Hello? Hello?

297
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,701
We have to sit tight and wait for orders.

298
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:51,418
I forgot something.

299
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,455
Forgot what?

300
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,685
My cell phone.

301
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:57,316
Where?

302
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:59,320
Home. Can I get it?

303
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:02,097
Nope. You'll be seen.

304
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:06,196
If the police find it, will they look at it?

305
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,138
Do you email your brother?

306
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:11,505
No.

307
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:13,972
It's got personal stuff.

308
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:17,081
I'd die of embarrassment.

309
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:41,631
My girls were so looking forward to
going skiing next month.

310
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:44,967
They just happened to be there.

311
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,975
Why'd they have to die for it?

312
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,907
I've lost everything.

313
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:54,778
I got the detective's address!

314
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,112
From a police press club reporter.

315
00:30:57,222 --> 00:31:00,191
Detective Katsuura lives apart
from his family.

316
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:09,397
10:50 p.m.

317
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:14,737
One more.

318
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:17,372
Funamura

319
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:20,411
Check this, too.

320
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:21,842
Gotcha.

321
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,477
Find anything?

322
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:29,579
Open the ceiling.

323
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:10,851
Katsuura-san!

324
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,292
What're you doing here?

325
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:17,528
Where's the sister?

326
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:20,334
She's safe with someone.

327
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:35,144
Excuse me.

328
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:39,048
Excuse me!

329
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,395
Are you a cop?

330
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:48,062
Non.

331
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:51,934
Family?

332
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:55,667
Non.

333
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:56,931
Then who?

334
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:02,305
He said you'd die if they read your email.

335
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:19,920
Found it.

336
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:21,858
Check her email.

337
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:30,002
Kids these days are wanton.

338
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:33,336
And this is what it leads to.

339
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:37,546
My kid does the same thing.

340
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:41,811
Really. I'd shoot any boy she brings home.

341
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,022
Just email from friends.

342
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:54,960
This bodyguard thing may drag out.

343
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,296
How so?

344
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:59,302
Her brother isn't talking at all.

345
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:02,638
No confession yet?

346
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:05,832
We thought he'd break quickly.

347
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:11,640
His prints are on the weapon,
and he was seen with the victims.

348
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,917
What does the father say?

349
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:19,789
That he ran a disciplined household.

350
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:24,595
He didn't spare the rod
when helping the kid cram for exams.

351
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,366
But he knew nothing of the crime.

352
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:37,599
There's nothing that'll elicit a
quick confession.

353
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:40,970
I'll see ya.

354
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:43,377
Katsuura-san.

355
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,617
A message from the Chief.

356
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:52,845
The folks weren't home, but the sister was.

357
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,924
She must've seen him.

358
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:56,789
Yeah?

359
00:34:56,894 --> 00:35:01,422
You're to get a statement from her
before the investigators.

360
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:04,601
I'm just supposed to guard her.

361
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:09,105
It's not that simple.
Chief is looking to move up the ladder.

362
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,438
A career move, huh?

363
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,605
My blood's curdling.

364
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,903
Ma'am?

365
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,113
Ma'am?

366
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:20,441
What's going on?

367
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:21,978
Locked herself in.

368
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:25,120
Ma'am?

369
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:32,059
Are you all right, ma'am?

370
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,797
Please open up, ma'am.

371
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,128
We're opening the door.

372
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:41,165
Can you hear me, ma'am?

373
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:44,737
Give it here.

374
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:47,140
Get back!

375
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,550
Mishima! Help me!

376
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:59,146
What's going on?

377
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:00,986
The mother's killed herself.

378
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:03,326
She breathing?

379
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:05,592
No, she's not.

380
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:10,259
Call an ambulance!

381
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,199
What were you doing?

382
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,637
Call an ambulance, idiot!

383
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,636
Stay with me!

384
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:19,005
- Call HQ?
- Not yet.

385
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:20,810
Well, do it! Now!

386
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:24,047
Breathe!

387
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:25,740
I told you to watch her!

388
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:27,074
Sorry.

389
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:27,879
Nothing.

390
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:32,783
Come on!

391
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:38,522
Damn it!

392
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,788
Welcome back!

393
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:03,313
Her privacy's intact.
Now she won't kill herself.

394
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:04,573
You be quiet.

395
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:08,750
Be nice. I'm here as a favor.

396
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,455
Doctor, a word.

397
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:33,242
Oui. I'm a doctor. He's my patient.

398
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:49,121
"Was that your brother on TV?"

399
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:50,956
Her mother?

400
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:53,519
Yeah. We couldn't save her.

401
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:55,855
She doesn't know yet?

402
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:01,664
Should I tell her?

403
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:05,273
You're a psychiatrist. Tell me.

404
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:10,440
Tough call. She could panic.

405
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:17,954
But she'll find out sooner or later.
I'll tell her.

406
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:22,551
Thanks.

407
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:26,824
Let's go to my place.
I have sedatives if we need them.

408
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,167
You okay?

409
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:40,307
Yeah.

410
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:45,140
"Wow, your brother, a killer?
He was so quiet."

411
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,551
Don't worry, Saori.

412
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:00,421
Hop in.

413
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:27,653
Driver, follow that car.

414
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:42,695
12:25 a.m.

415
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:59,748
Saori? Can we talk?

416
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:01,815
Feel okay?

417
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:05,916
Yeah.

418
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:13,527
Maybe you could tell me what's going through
your mind right now.

419
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:16,659
What do you want?

420
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:32,041
Saori, I have to tell you something
about your mother.

421
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,712
Is she still at home?

422
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:37,447
Please let me see her.

423
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:38,613
Saori, listen...

424
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:39,950
From Tatsuro.

425
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,821
Hello?

426
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:50,131
I read about it on the Internet.
You all right?

427
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:51,325
Yeah.

428
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,060
Where are you?

429
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:56,230
I'm with a policeman.

430
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:05,072
Did your brother... really do it?

431
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:08,717
And your mom...

432
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:10,982
My mom what?

433
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:14,613
You don't know? She committed suicide.

434
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:17,554
It was on the news.

435
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,025
Tatsuro?

436
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:23,166
My parents. I'll call again later.

437
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:26,561
My mom?

438
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:39,606
Saori?

439
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:48,456
Is my mom dead?

440
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:50,287
I was just...

441
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:51,622
Really?

442
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:56,693
You knew? But you didn't tell me?

443
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,158
I was about to.

444
00:43:58,235 --> 00:43:59,793
Why didn't you tell me?

445
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:05,602
How could she?
She was with the police, right?

446
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:06,936
What were they doing?

447
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:07,635
Please...

448
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:08,609
I hate them!

449
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:09,508
Listen!

450
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:17,212
She hung herself in the bathroom.
I tried to revive her, but it was too late.

451
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,448
I want to see her. Where is she?

452
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:21,689
I can't.

453
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,028
No. I will see her!

454
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:27,597
Saori, wait!

455
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,632
Easy, Saori! Breathe!

456
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:33,191
Why did you do this to us?!

457
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,533
She didn't do anything wrong!

458
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:39,175
Neither did I!

459
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:44,846
My brother committed the crime, right?
Give me back my mother!

460
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:47,848
Get her back!

461
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,148
Get her back!

462
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:07,431
You have to get her back!

463
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:10,595
Yes?

464
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,801
We know who's with you.

465
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:18,314
Police.

466
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:21,413
I know. Detective Katsuura.

467
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,080
You are?

468
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:25,280
Umemoto of the Towa Newspaper.

469
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:27,953
How'd you find us?

470
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:30,618
You have the sister. Talk to us.

471
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:32,356
Don't.

472
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:33,896
Let us see her.

473
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:37,098
She's not involved.

474
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:41,228
Yes, she is. She's family.
She should apologize.

475
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:43,230
Forget it.

476
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:46,067
Find something else to cover.

477
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:47,575
We just might.

478
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:52,074
Like what you did three years ago.

479
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:58,043
You let a crazed drug addict
walk the streets.

480
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:01,882
An innocent child got killed.

481
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:03,557
What's your point?

482
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,061
That you shelter criminals
for your investigations.

483
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,960
And you use tax money to do it.

484
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:14,895
Look at the mess it creates, too.
Your responsibility is to us!

485
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:16,973
The victims have a family, too!

486
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:22,478
They want the killer's family to atone
for what happened!

487
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:24,069
To pay with their very lives!

488
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:32,020
What, you want the girl dead?

489
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,454
It's only natural she be punished.

490
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:43,189
Get the hell out of here.

491
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:45,396
I'll be back tomorrow.

492
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:05,480
I put her to sleep.
She'll be out until morning.

493
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:12,959
She's still struggling to understand
her situation.

494
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:17,591
How to deal with her brother...
and her mother's death.

495
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:34,241
Too much for a 15-year-old.

496
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:48,898
Here, cold medicine.
Caught it from your son, huh?

497
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:52,067
Yeah, he never leaves the house.

498
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:54,327
Isn't he in middle school?

499
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:55,598
He doesn't go.

500
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:58,165
He gets bullied.

501
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,041
I'm sorry.

502
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:06,774
The school abandons him,
and protects the bullies.

503
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,179
Like the police.

504
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:22,295
2: 10 a.m.

505
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:25,392
"Sister Homicides Special Investigations"

506
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:31,899
"Naoto Funamura"

507
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:37,775
What are you doing here?

508
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:40,348
Awaiting my next orders.

509
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,617
There won't be any.

510
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:46,715
What?

511
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:48,484
We'll handle the sister.

512
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,022
Did she say anything?

513
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:55,895
How could she? We were too busy running.

514
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:59,025
Well, hurry and get something on her brother.

515
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:03,768
Get it yourself. I'll bring her in.

516
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:05,068
Your family vacation?

517
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:06,699
That's not it!

518
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:23,016
I've no place to hide her.
And getting statements is not my job.

519
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,650
It is now.

520
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:26,852
Any proof of her brother's guilt.

521
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:31,927
Then call me.
I'll give it to Special Investigations.

522
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:37,138
Then let me take her to see her mother.

523
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:41,936
Not before her statement.
Use that to get her talking.

524
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:49,880
I'm out.

525
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:53,684
I'm not interested in helping you
score points.

526
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:54,888
Katsuura!

527
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:57,017
We failed to protect her mother!

528
00:49:57,561 --> 00:50:01,429
The press is taking us
to task for "protecting criminals."

529
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:07,101
Besides, I can't protect anyone.

530
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,367
You're in the morning paper.

531
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:14,505
Over an old can of worms.

532
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:26,351
It led to a suspension once.
This time, you could lose your badge.

533
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:28,618
"Police Criminal Protection: What Justice?"

534
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,169
I'm moving in.

535
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:48,371
Don't worry. I'll take care of you this time.

536
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:53,008
Take the sister and leave Tokyo.

537
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:56,486
Go somewhere the media isn't.

538
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:28,546
7:20 a.m.,

539
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:37,583
Day Two Under Protection

540
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:56,977
Morning.

541
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,516
Know where you're going?

542
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:13,357
Saori, if you need a friend, call me.

543
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:17,959
What's that?

544
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:20,763
Present for my daughter.

545
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:22,705
I see.

546
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:26,806
No skipping out on your counseling.

547
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:28,706
I won't.

548
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:41,148
Stay with her till it's over, will you?

549
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:13,722

00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:38,837
"We won't stand for this!"

555
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:41,383
"Don't mess with us!"

556
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:49,683
"The perp's name is Naoto Funamura, 18."

557
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:54,019
"From 'Daimajin'"

558
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:58,464
"Got his name!"

559
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:01,731
"Suspect's address is 4-7-14 Takada!"

560
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:04,568
"Great work guys!"

561
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:05,902
"Bad eggs, man!"

562
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,568
"Posting a photo of the perp!"

563
00:54:12,048 --> 00:54:16,280
"Expose the hell out of 'em!"

564
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:21,381
Not hungry, huh?

565
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:24,657
You've got to keep your strength.

566
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:30,789
So you're 15.

567
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:38,272
Still a child, but facing adulthood.

568
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:41,671
So I'll treat you as an adult, okay?

569
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:46,772
Granted, your situation is harsh.

570
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:49,351
I wish I could do something to help.

571
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:53,554
But my job is to keep you hidden.

572
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:57,616
You know your job, right?

573
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:02,322
It's to tell me about your brother.

574
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:08,168
He refuses to speak.

575
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:11,974
He's admitted nothing.

576
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:14,436
Really?

577
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:21,848
On the day of the crime,
you were at home, right?

578
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:25,982
What did you see when he came home?

579
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:30,325
In the grade school sister murders that
has gripped the nation...

580
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:32,952
an 18-year-old boy has been arrested.

581
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:37,298
Soon afterwards, the suspect's mother
committed suicide...

582
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:43,737
which is raising questions about
police handling of the situation.

583
00:55:44,974 --> 00:55:48,410
A newspaper column this morning about
police mishandlings...

584
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:51,810
Excuse me. Could you change the channel?

585
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:57,679
Including one 3 years ago in which a
4-year-old boy was stabbed to death...

586
00:55:57,887 --> 00:56:02,881
by a drug-addled man, all under the watch
of a police detective...

587
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:06,660
who had been tailing the man.

588
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:11,830
The case drew criticism as police
neglect of public safety.

589
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:16,903
Sources say that same detective
is currently in charge of...

590
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:20,574
protecting the anonymity
of the suspect's sister.

591
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:27,846
Should the police be giving aid
to the suspect's family members?

592
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:29,213
Let's go.

593
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:32,510
Come on.

594
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:39,694
Don't forget that the mother killed herself
while surrounded by police.

595
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:43,060
This was an egregious and careless mistake.

596
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,462
What?

597
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:55,804
Stop staring.

598
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,849
Fine, suit yourself.

599
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:10,086
Run off, then. Go take care of yourself.

600
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,028
But out there...

601
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:16,798
no one will look after you.

602
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:27,334
Hello?

603
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:28,570
Dad?

604
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:30,704
Mina.

605
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:34,140
Sorry I didn't return your email.

606
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,911
Ready for the trip?

607
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:40,017
I'm still working.

608
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,990
You reserved the B&B, right?

609
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:45,985
I'm protecting a girl.

610
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:47,392
A girl?

611
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,995
About your age.

612
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:04,004
Dad?

613
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:12,748
I'm leaving Tokyo.

614
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:15,691
What? We leave tomorrow!

615
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,892
I'll call you later.

616
00:58:59,168 --> 00:59:01,432
It's too dangerous. I'm arresting him.

617
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:04,506
Not yet. Follow him to his dealer.

618
00:59:04,607 --> 00:59:05,539
I have to!

619
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:06,768
No!

620
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:20,784
I lost him.

621
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:27,127
Damn it!

622
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,730
Damn it!
