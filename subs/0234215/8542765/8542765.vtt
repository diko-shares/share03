00:00:27.288 --> 00:00:30.666
<i>- Is everything in place?
- You weren't supposed to relieve me.</i>

2
00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.544
<i>I know, but I felt like taking a shift.</i>

3
00:00:34.128 --> 00:00:36.464
<i>You like him, don't you?
You like watching him.</i>

4
00:00:36.755 --> 00:00:39.758
<i>- Don't be ridiculous.
- We're gonna kill him. You understand?</i>

5
00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:42.470
<i>Morpheus believes he is the One.</i>

6
00:00:42.761 --> 00:00:43.761
<i>Do you?</i>

7
00:00:43.888 --> 00:00:45.681
<i>It doesn't matter what I believe.</i>

8
00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:47.516
<i>You don't, do you?</i>

9
00:00:47.808 --> 00:00:49.852
<i>- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?</i>

10
00:00:50.144 --> 00:00:51.687
<i>Are you sure this line is clean?</i>

11
00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:53.939
<i>Yeah, of course I'm sure.</i>

12
00:00:54.315 --> 00:00:55.774
<i>I better go.</i>

13
00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.481
- Freeze! Police!
- Hands on your head!

14
00:01:36.065 --> 00:01:37.107
Do it! Do it now!

15
00:01:58.546 --> 00:01:59.839
Lieutenant.

16
00:02:00.172 --> 00:02:01.172
Oh, shit.

17
00:02:02.007 --> 00:02:05.177
Lieutenant, you were given
specific orders.

18
00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:07.179
l'm just doing my job.

19
00:02:07.805 --> 00:02:12.184
You give me that ''juris-my-dick-tion''
crap, you can cram it up your ass.

20
00:02:12.685 --> 00:02:15.146
The orders were for your protection.

21
00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:18.858
l think we can handle one little girl.

22
00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:25.739
l sent two units!

23
00:02:26.031 --> 00:02:27.575
They're bringing her down now!

24
00:02:27.876 --> 00:02:29.976
No, Lieutenant, your men
are already dead.

25
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.400
Shit.

26
00:03:03.737 --> 00:03:06.114
Morpheus, the line was traced.
l don't know how.

27
00:03:06.406 --> 00:03:07.949
<i>I know. They cut the hard line.</i>

28
00:03:08.241 --> 00:03:10.368
<i>There's no time.
Get to another exit.</i>

29
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.995
Are there any agents?

30
00:03:12.245 --> 00:03:13.231
<i>Yes.</i>

31
00:03:13.246 --> 00:03:14.414
Goddamn it.

32
00:03:14.664 --> 00:03:16.208
<i>You have to focus, Trinity.</i>

33
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.835
<i>There's a phone at Wells and Lake.</i>

34
00:03:19.252 --> 00:03:20.879
<i>You can make it.</i>

35
00:03:21.171 --> 00:03:22.798
- All right.
<i>- Go.</i>

36
00:04:24.985 --> 00:04:25.986
That's impossible.

37
00:05:01.021 --> 00:05:03.023
Get up, Trinity.
Just get up.

38
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:04.858
Get up.

39
00:05:50.737 --> 00:05:52.239
She got out.

40
00:05:52.572 --> 00:05:53.824
lt doesn't matter.

41
00:05:54.074 --> 00:05:56.159
The informant is real.

42
00:05:57.494 --> 00:05:59.162
We have the name of their next target.

43
00:05:59.412 --> 00:06:01.081
The name is Neo.

44
00:06:04.417 --> 00:06:05.877
We'll need a search running.

45
00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:08.088
lt has already begun.

46
00:07:02.893 --> 00:07:04.060
What?

47
00:07:09.816 --> 00:07:11.318
What the hell?

48
00:07:18.992 --> 00:07:20.911
''Follow the white rabbit. ''

49
00:07:32.756 --> 00:07:33.924
Who is it?

50
00:07:34.174 --> 00:07:35.467
lt's Choi.

51
00:07:49.022 --> 00:07:50.148
You're two hours late.

52
00:07:50.774 --> 00:07:52.484
l know. lt's her fault.

53
00:07:52.776 --> 00:07:53.776
You got the money?

54
00:07:55.862 --> 00:07:57.030
Two grand.

55
00:07:57.948 --> 00:07:59.032
Hold on.

56
00:08:16.716 --> 00:08:18.093
Hallelujah.

57
00:08:18.385 --> 00:08:21.221
You're my savior.
My own personal Jesus Christ.

58
00:08:21.471 --> 00:08:23.348
You get caught using that...

59
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.725
l know. This never happened.
You don't exist.

60
00:08:26.893 --> 00:08:28.937
- Right.
- Something wrong, man?

61
00:08:29.229 --> 00:08:31.231
You look a little whiter than usual.

62
00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:34.526
My computer, it...

63
00:08:37.571 --> 00:08:42.075
Ever have that feeling where you're
not sure if you're awake or dreaming?

64
00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:45.620
All the time.
lt's called mescaline.

65
00:08:46.163 --> 00:08:48.248
lt's the only way to fly.

66
00:08:49.166 --> 00:08:51.626
lt just sounds like you
need to unplug.

67
00:08:52.419 --> 00:08:54.421
Get some R and R?

68
00:08:54.838 --> 00:08:58.550
What do you think, Dujour?
Should we take him with us?

69
00:09:00.594 --> 00:09:01.761
Definitely.

70
00:09:02.012 --> 00:09:05.182
No, l can't. l have work tomorrow.

71
00:09:05.765 --> 00:09:06.850
Come on.

72
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.728
lt'll be fun. l promise.

73
00:09:16.276 --> 00:09:17.736
Yeah.

74
00:09:18.612 --> 00:09:20.447
Sure. l'll go.

75
00:09:48.141 --> 00:09:49.141
Hello, Neo.

76
00:09:50.644 --> 00:09:51.644
How do you know that name?

77
00:09:52.479 --> 00:09:54.147
l know a lot about you.

78
00:09:55.065 --> 00:09:56.065
Who are you?

79
00:09:56.149 --> 00:09:57.149
My name is Trinity.

80
00:09:58.068 --> 00:09:59.277
Trinity.

81
00:10:01.071 --> 00:10:02.072
The Trinity?

82
00:10:02.572 --> 00:10:04.241
That cracked the lRS D-base?

83
00:10:04.533 --> 00:10:05.951
That was a long time ago.

84
00:10:06.243 --> 00:10:07.243
Jesus.

85
00:10:07.327 --> 00:10:08.327
What?

86
00:10:08.578 --> 00:10:10.372
l just thought...

87
00:10:12.124 --> 00:10:13.291
...you were a guy<i>:</i>

88
00:10:13.583 --> 00:10:15.001
Most guys do.

89
00:10:16.253 --> 00:10:18.421
That was you on my computer.

90
00:10:19.089 --> 00:10:20.173
How did you do that?

91
00:10:20.841 --> 00:10:23.510
Right now, all l can tell you...

92
00:10:24.177 --> 00:10:25.679
...is that you're in danger.

93
00:10:26.138 --> 00:10:28.557
- l brought you here to warn you.
- Of what?

94
00:10:29.182 --> 00:10:30.809
They're watching you, Neo.

95
00:10:31.434 --> 00:10:32.420
Who is?

96
00:10:32.435 --> 00:10:33.812
Please just listen.

97
00:10:37.357 --> 00:10:39.151
l know why you're here, Neo.

98
00:10:39.985 --> 00:10:41.903
l know what you've been doing.

99
00:10:42.195 --> 00:10:44.030
l know why you hardly sleep...

100
00:10:44.322 --> 00:10:47.451
...why you live alone and why,
night after night...

101
00:10:47.742 --> 00:10:50.036
...you sit at your computer.

102
00:10:51.204 --> 00:10:52.747
You're looking for him.

103
00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.543
l know, because l was once
looking for the same thing.

104
00:10:57.043 --> 00:10:59.171
And when he found me...

105
00:10:59.796 --> 00:11:02.883
...he told me l wasn't really
looking for him...

106
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.552
...l was looking for an answer.

107
00:11:06.219 --> 00:11:09.306
lt's the question that drives us, Neo.

108
00:11:09.973 --> 00:11:12.642
lt's the question
that brought you here.

109
00:11:14.728 --> 00:11:16.104
You know the question...

110
00:11:16.396 --> 00:11:17.856
...just as l did.

111
00:11:19.399 --> 00:11:21.026
What is the Matrix?

112
00:11:21.318 --> 00:11:23.737
The answer is out there, Neo.

113
00:11:24.404 --> 00:11:26.406
lt's looking for you.

114
00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.909
And it will find you...

115
00:11:29.159 --> 00:11:31.161
...if you want it to.

116
00:11:38.001 --> 00:11:39.001
Shit.

117
00:11:39.085 --> 00:11:40.295
Shit, shit.

118
00:11:50.597 --> 00:11:53.391
You have a problem with authority,
Mr. Anderson.

119
00:11:53.683 --> 00:11:57.687
You believe that you are special,
that the rules do not apply to you.

120
00:11:58.438 --> 00:12:00.398
Obviously, you are mistaken.

121
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.238
This is one of the top
software companies in the world...

122
00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.866
...because employees understand
they are part of a whole.

123
00:12:10.117 --> 00:12:14.746
Thus, if an employee has a problem,
the company has a problem.

124
00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.210
The time has come to make
a choice, Mr. Anderson.

125
00:12:21.128 --> 00:12:24.965
Either you choose to be at your desk
on time from this day forth...

126
00:12:25.632 --> 00:12:28.176
...or you choose to find another job.

127
00:12:29.052 --> 00:12:30.387
Do l make myself clear?

128
00:12:30.637 --> 00:12:33.056
Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.
Perfectly clear.

129
00:12:41.565 --> 00:12:42.565
Thomas Anderson?

130
00:12:44.651 --> 00:12:46.069
Yeah, that's me.

131
00:12:54.077 --> 00:12:55.245
Great.

132
00:12:56.663 --> 00:12:57.831
Have a nice day.

133
00:13:14.681 --> 00:13:17.976
<i>Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?</i>

134
00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:21.980
- Morpheus.
<i>- Yes.</i>

135
00:13:22.272 --> 00:13:24.232
<i>I've been looking for you.</i>

136
00:13:24.524 --> 00:13:27.652
<i>I don't know if you're ready to see
what I want to show you.</i>

137
00:13:27.944 --> 00:13:31.072
<i>But unfortunately, you and I
have run out of time.</i>

138
00:13:31.364 --> 00:13:35.035
<i>They're coming for you, and I don't know
what they're going to do.</i>

139
00:13:35.285 --> 00:13:36.620
Who's coming for me?

140
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:38.955
<i>Stand up and see for yourself.</i>

141
00:13:39.206 --> 00:13:40.707
What? Right now?

142
00:13:41.041 --> 00:13:42.041
<i>Yes.</i>

143
00:13:42.292 --> 00:13:43.502
<i>Now.</i>

144
00:13:44.377 --> 00:13:46.254
<i>Do it slowly.</i>

145
00:13:46.713 --> 00:13:47.881
<i>The elevator.</i>

146
00:13:52.803 --> 00:13:54.554
Oh, shit!

147
00:13:59.226 --> 00:14:00.227
What do they want?

148
00:14:00.477 --> 00:14:04.147
<i>I don't know. If you don't want
to find out, get out of there.</i>

149
00:14:04.397 --> 00:14:05.217
How?

150
00:14:05.232 --> 00:14:08.401
<i>I can guide you,
but you must do exactly as I say.</i>

151
00:14:09.319 --> 00:14:11.279
<i>The cubicle across from you is empty.</i>

152
00:14:14.407 --> 00:14:16.535
- But what if they...
<i>- Go. Now.</i>

153
00:14:23.333 --> 00:14:25.669
<i>Stay here for just a moment.</i>

154
00:14:32.926 --> 00:14:35.637
<i>When I tell you,
go to the end of the row...</i>

155
00:14:35.929 --> 00:14:37.848
<i>... to the office
at the end of the hall.</i>

156
00:14:38.098 --> 00:14:40.475
<i>Stay as low as you can.</i>

157
00:14:42.936 --> 00:14:43.936
<i>Go. Now.</i>

158
00:14:58.285 --> 00:15:01.830
<i>Good. Now, outside
there is a scaffold.</i>

159
00:15:04.541 --> 00:15:06.877
- How do you know this?
<i>- We don't have time.</i>

160
00:15:07.127 --> 00:15:09.963
<i>To your left there's a window.
Go to it.</i>

161
00:15:12.215 --> 00:15:13.758
<i>Open it.</i>

162
00:15:14.634 --> 00:15:16.386
<i>Take the scaffold to the roof.</i>

163
00:15:16.636 --> 00:15:19.222
No way! No way!
This is crazy!

164
00:15:19.473 --> 00:15:21.850
<i>There are two ways
out of this building.</i>

165
00:15:22.142 --> 00:15:25.896
<i>One is that scaffold.
The other is in their custody.</i>

166
00:15:26.146 --> 00:15:29.357
<i>You take a chance either way.
I leave it to you.</i>

167
00:15:32.986 --> 00:15:34.696
This is insane!

168
00:15:35.906 --> 00:15:37.741
Why is this happening to me?

169
00:15:38.074 --> 00:15:39.659
What'd l do?

170
00:15:40.076 --> 00:15:42.788
l'm nobody.
l didn't do anything.

171
00:15:43.413 --> 00:15:44.831
l'm gonna die.

172
00:15:54.674 --> 00:15:55.675
Shit!

173
00:16:15.946 --> 00:16:17.072
Oh, shit!

174
00:16:22.035 --> 00:16:23.829
l can't do this.

175
00:16:36.716 --> 00:16:37.716
Shit.

176
00:17:26.766 --> 00:17:31.605
As you can see, we've had our eye
on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.

177
00:17:32.939 --> 00:17:35.567
lt seems that you've been living...

178
00:17:35.859 --> 00:17:37.944
...two lives.

179
00:17:39.362 --> 00:17:41.865
ln one life,
you're Thomas A. Anderson...

180
00:17:42.115 --> 00:17:45.452
...program writer for
a respectable software company.

181
00:17:46.536 --> 00:17:49.790
You have a social security number.
You pay your taxes.

182
00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:51.500
And you...

183
00:17:53.126 --> 00:17:56.713
...help your landlady
carry out her garbage.

184
00:17:59.216 --> 00:18:02.344
The other life is lived in computers...

185
00:18:02.636 --> 00:18:05.597
...where you go by
the hacker alias ''Neo''...

186
00:18:05.889 --> 00:18:10.644
...and are guilty of virtually every
computer crime we have a law for.

187
00:18:11.937 --> 00:18:13.897
One of these lives...

188
00:18:14.147 --> 00:18:15.982
...has a future.

189
00:18:16.316 --> 00:18:18.318
And one of them does not.

190
00:18:22.072 --> 00:18:25.867
l'm going to be as forthcoming
as l can be, Mr. Anderson.

191
00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:28.203
You're here...

192
00:18:28.578 --> 00:18:30.789
...because we need your help.

193
00:18:34.417 --> 00:18:37.420
We know that you've been contacted
by a certain...

194
00:18:37.671 --> 00:18:39.464
...individual.

195
00:18:40.423 --> 00:18:44.427
A man who calls himself ''Morpheus. ''

196
00:18:45.428 --> 00:18:49.432
Whatever you think you know
about this man is irrelevant.

197
00:18:49.683 --> 00:18:52.102
He is considered by many authorities...

198
00:18:52.352 --> 00:18:55.397
...to be the most dangerous man alive.

199
00:18:58.191 --> 00:18:59.359
My colleagues...

200
00:18:59.776 --> 00:19:02.696
...believe that l am wasting
my time with you.

201
00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:06.408
But l believe you wish
to do the right thing.

202
00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:10.203
We're willing to wipe the slate clean...

203
00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.706
...give you a fresh start.

204
00:19:13.206 --> 00:19:16.126
All we're asking in return
is your cooperation...

205
00:19:16.376 --> 00:19:19.880
...in bringing
a known terrorist to justice.

206
00:19:21.298 --> 00:19:22.507
Yeah.

207
00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.886
That sounds like a really good deal.

208
00:19:27.554 --> 00:19:29.264
But l got a better one.

209
00:19:29.556 --> 00:19:31.016
How about...

210
00:19:31.475 --> 00:19:33.435
...l give you the finger...

211
00:19:36.062 --> 00:19:38.064
...and you give me my phone call.

212
00:19:40.233 --> 00:19:42.068
Mr. Anderson...

213
00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:47.490
...you disappoint me.

214
00:19:47.574 --> 00:19:50.160
You can't scare me
with this gestapo crap.

215
00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:51.787
l know my rights.

216
00:19:52.037 --> 00:19:53.538
l want my phone call.

217
00:19:54.122 --> 00:19:56.291
Tell me, Mr. Anderson...

218
00:19:57.167 --> 00:19:58.585
...what good is a phone call...

219
00:19:58.835 --> 00:20:02.422
...if you're unable to speak?

220
00:20:36.248 --> 00:20:38.416
You're going to help us,
Mr. Anderson...

221
00:20:39.126 --> 00:20:40.126
...whether you want to...

222
00:20:40.377 --> 00:20:41.377
...or not.

223
00:21:39.519 --> 00:21:42.772
<i>This line is tapped,
so I must be brief.</i>

224
00:21:43.023 --> 00:21:47.319
<i>They got to you first, but they've
underestimated how important you are.</i>

225
00:21:47.611 --> 00:21:49.404
<i>If they knew what I know...</i>

226
00:21:49.696 --> 00:21:51.656
<i>... you would probably be dead.</i>

227
00:21:52.699 --> 00:21:56.369
What are you talking about?
What is happening to me?

228
00:21:56.661 --> 00:22:01.458
<i>You are the One, Neo. You may have
spent the last few years...</i>

229
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.669
<i>...looking for me, but I've spent
my entire life...</i>

230
00:22:04.961 --> 00:22:06.421
<i>...looking for you.</i>

231
00:22:08.006 --> 00:22:10.133
<i>Now, do you still want to meet?</i>

232
00:22:11.134 --> 00:22:13.970
- Yes.
<i>- Then go to the Adams Street bridge.</i>

233
00:22:24.231 --> 00:22:25.398
Get in.

234
00:22:37.661 --> 00:22:38.661
What's this?

235
00:22:38.745 --> 00:22:41.289
lt's necessary, Neo.
For our protection.

236
00:22:41.581 --> 00:22:42.581
From what?

237
00:22:42.833 --> 00:22:43.833
From you.

238
00:22:45.252 --> 00:22:46.711
Take off your shirt.

239
00:22:47.254 --> 00:22:48.254
Stop the car.

240
00:22:52.676 --> 00:22:53.802
Listen, coppertop.

241
00:22:54.094 --> 00:22:56.054
We don't have time for 20 Questions.

242
00:22:56.596 --> 00:22:58.932
Right now, there's only one rule:

243
00:22:59.266 --> 00:23:00.559
Our way...

244
00:23:00.934 --> 00:23:01.977
...or the highway.

245
00:23:08.775 --> 00:23:09.775
Fine.

246
00:23:11.528 --> 00:23:13.947
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.

247
00:23:14.531 --> 00:23:17.159
- Why?
- Because you have been down there.

248
00:23:17.951 --> 00:23:19.119
You know that road.

249
00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.788
You know exactly where it ends.

250
00:23:23.957 --> 00:23:26.209
And l know that's
not where you want to be.

251
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:41.933
Apoc, lights.

252
00:23:44.478 --> 00:23:46.605
Lie back.
Lift up your shirt.

253
00:23:48.565 --> 00:23:49.565
What's that?

254
00:23:49.733 --> 00:23:50.776
You're bugged.

255
00:23:58.575 --> 00:23:59.993
Try and relax.

256
00:24:06.333 --> 00:24:07.459
Come on.

257
00:24:08.668 --> 00:24:09.668
Come on.

258
00:24:11.338 --> 00:24:12.338
lt's on the move.

259
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:15.300
Come on, you shit.

260
00:24:17.177 --> 00:24:19.429
- You're gonna lose it.
- No, l'm not.

261
00:24:19.679 --> 00:24:20.679
Clear!

262
00:24:29.272 --> 00:24:31.358
Jesus Christ!
That thing's real?!

263
00:25:05.142 --> 00:25:06.434
This is it.

264
00:25:09.813 --> 00:25:12.232
Let me give you one piece of advice.

265
00:25:13.233 --> 00:25:14.860
Be honest.

266
00:25:16.486 --> 00:25:18.655
He knows more than you can imagine.

267
00:25:27.414 --> 00:25:28.707
At last.

268
00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:31.334
Welcome, Neo.

269
00:25:32.586 --> 00:25:34.463
As you no doubt have guessed...

270
00:25:34.754 --> 00:25:35.964
...l am Morpheus.

271
00:25:37.007 --> 00:25:38.592
lt's an honor to meet you.

272
00:25:39.092 --> 00:25:40.093
No...

273
00:25:40.677 --> 00:25:41.970
...the honor is mine.

274
00:25:42.929 --> 00:25:45.390
Please, come. Sit.

275
00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:02.115
l imagine...

276
00:26:02.532 --> 00:26:05.285
...that right now you're feeling
a bit like Alice...

277
00:26:07.037 --> 00:26:09.414
...tumbling down the rabbit hole?

278
00:26:10.373 --> 00:26:11.373
You could say that.

279
00:26:12.292 --> 00:26:14.878
l can see it in your eyes.

280
00:26:15.462 --> 00:26:18.757
You have the look of a man
who accepts what he sees...

281
00:26:19.049 --> 00:26:21.259
...because he's expecting to wake up.

282
00:26:22.719 --> 00:26:25.305
lronically, this is not
far from the truth.

283
00:26:25.972 --> 00:26:28.475
Do you believe in fate, Neo?

284
00:26:28.809 --> 00:26:29.809
No.

285
00:26:30.143 --> 00:26:31.143
Why not?

286
00:26:31.311 --> 00:26:34.105
l don't like the idea that
l'm not in control of my life.

287
00:26:35.232 --> 00:26:38.527
l know exactly what you mean.

288
00:26:42.823 --> 00:26:45.200
Let me tell you why you're here.

289
00:26:46.243 --> 00:26:47.786
You know something.

290
00:26:48.328 --> 00:26:49.955
What you know,
you can't explain.

291
00:26:50.497 --> 00:26:52.040
But you feel it.

292
00:26:52.666 --> 00:26:54.543
You felt it your entire life.

293
00:26:55.168 --> 00:26:59.297
Something's wrong with the world.
You don't know what, but it's there.

294
00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:02.008
Like a splinter in your mind...

295
00:27:02.259 --> 00:27:04.136
...driving you mad.

296
00:27:05.095 --> 00:27:07.806
lt is this feeling
that has brought you to me.

297
00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:12.185
Do you know what
l'm talking about?

298
00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:15.355
The Matrix?

299
00:27:17.858 --> 00:27:19.526
Do you want to know...

300
00:27:20.026 --> 00:27:21.987
...what it is?

301
00:27:24.364 --> 00:27:26.241
The Matrix is everywhere.

302
00:27:26.533 --> 00:27:28.201
lt is all around us.

303
00:27:28.452 --> 00:27:30.412
Even now, in this very room.

304
00:27:31.288 --> 00:27:33.457
You can see it when you
look out your window...

305
00:27:33.707 --> 00:27:36.042
...or when you turn on your television.

306
00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:39.004
You can feel it when you go to work...

307
00:27:40.547 --> 00:27:42.215
...when you go to church...

308
00:27:42.632 --> 00:27:44.718
...when you pay your taxes.

309
00:27:45.886 --> 00:27:48.763
lt is the world that has been
pulled over your eyes...

310
00:27:49.055 --> 00:27:50.599
...to blind you from the truth.

311
00:27:52.809 --> 00:27:54.060
What truth?

312
00:27:58.315 --> 00:27:59.858
That you are a slave.

313
00:28:01.401 --> 00:28:03.653
Like everyone else,
you were born into bondage...

314
00:28:03.904 --> 00:28:08.575
...born into a prison that you cannot
smell or taste or touch.

315
00:28:08.909 --> 00:28:10.160
A prison...

316
00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:11.578
...for your mind.

317
00:28:18.585 --> 00:28:20.879
Unfortunately, no one can be...

318
00:28:21.254 --> 00:28:23.590
...told what the Matrix is.

319
00:28:27.093 --> 00:28:28.929
You have to see it for yourself.

320
00:28:38.438 --> 00:28:40.732
This is your last chance.

321
00:28:41.024 --> 00:28:43.318
After this, there is no turning back.

322
00:28:43.777 --> 00:28:45.278
You take the blue pill...

323
00:28:45.612 --> 00:28:48.615
...the story ends, you wake up
in your bed and believe...

324
00:28:48.865 --> 00:28:50.659
...whatever you want to believe.

325
00:28:50.951 --> 00:28:52.244
You take the red pill...

326
00:28:52.536 --> 00:28:54.454
...you stay in Wonderland...

327
00:28:54.955 --> 00:28:57.666
...and l show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes.

328
00:29:07.551 --> 00:29:08.760
Remember...

329
00:29:09.636 --> 00:29:12.639
...all l'm offering is the truth.
Nothing more.

330
00:29:26.987 --> 00:29:28.280
Follow me.

331
00:29:30.824 --> 00:29:32.492
Apoc, are we on-line?

332
00:29:32.742 --> 00:29:34.119
Almost.

333
00:29:37.497 --> 00:29:39.499
Time is always against us.

334
00:29:39.916 --> 00:29:41.376
Please take a seat there.

335
00:29:59.603 --> 00:30:01.271
You did all this?

336
00:30:05.442 --> 00:30:07.402
The pill you took is
part of a trace program.

337
00:30:08.195 --> 00:30:12.783
lt disrupts your carrier signals
so we can pinpoint your location.

338
00:30:13.366 --> 00:30:14.367
What does that mean?

339
00:30:14.951 --> 00:30:17.120
lt means buckle your
seat belt, Dorothy...

340
00:30:17.454 --> 00:30:18.789
...because Kansas...

341
00:30:19.039 --> 00:30:20.081
...is going bye-bye.

342
00:30:57.994 --> 00:30:59.371
Did you...?

343
00:31:10.423 --> 00:31:14.469
Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
that you were so sure was real?

344
00:31:15.929 --> 00:31:18.515
What if you were unable
to wake from that dream?

345
00:31:18.765 --> 00:31:21.268
How would you know the difference
between the dream world...

346
00:31:21.935 --> 00:31:23.311
...and the real world?

347
00:31:24.938 --> 00:31:26.148
This can't be.

348
00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.440
Be what?

349
00:31:28.024 --> 00:31:29.526
Be real?

350
00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:34.781
Going into replication.

351
00:31:35.282 --> 00:31:36.282
Still nothing.

352
00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:37.909
lt's cold.

353
00:31:38.201 --> 00:31:39.536
lt's cold!

354
00:31:43.457 --> 00:31:45.083
Tank, we'll need a signal soon.

355
00:31:46.626 --> 00:31:47.626
l got a fibrillation.

356
00:31:47.711 --> 00:31:49.254
Apoc, location.

357
00:31:49.546 --> 00:31:50.964
Targeting almost there.

358
00:31:54.301 --> 00:31:55.677
He's going into arrest.

359
00:31:55.969 --> 00:31:56.955
Lock. l got him!

360
00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:58.430
Now, Tank, now!

361
00:34:55.625 --> 00:34:56.710
Welcome...

362
00:34:57.043 --> 00:34:58.962
...to the real world.

363
00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:02.215
We've done it, Trinity.

364
00:35:02.465 --> 00:35:04.008
We found him.

365
00:35:04.259 --> 00:35:07.053
- l hope you're right.
- l don't have to hope.

366
00:35:07.637 --> 00:35:09.222
l know it.

367
00:35:14.394 --> 00:35:15.437
Am l dead?

368
00:35:15.937 --> 00:35:18.106
Far from it.

369
00:35:32.078 --> 00:35:33.496
He still needs a lot of work.

370
00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.124
What are you doing?

371
00:35:36.374 --> 00:35:38.585
Your muscles atrophied.
We're rebuilding them.

372
00:35:39.169 --> 00:35:40.712
Why do my eyes hurt?

373
00:35:41.421 --> 00:35:43.298
You've never used them before.

374
00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:48.260
Rest, Neo.

375
00:35:48.344 --> 00:35:50.013
The answers are coming.

376
00:37:04.587 --> 00:37:06.172
Morpheus, what's happened to me?

377
00:37:06.923 --> 00:37:07.923
What is this place?

378
00:37:08.133 --> 00:37:10.802
More important than ''what'' is ''when. ''

379
00:37:11.511 --> 00:37:12.511
When?

380
00:37:12.554 --> 00:37:14.597
You believe it's the year 1999...

381
00:37:14.848 --> 00:37:17.100
...when in fact, it's closer to 2199.

382
00:37:18.226 --> 00:37:20.979
l can't tell you exactly
what year it is...

383
00:37:21.229 --> 00:37:22.856
...because we honestly don't know.

384
00:37:23.356 --> 00:37:26.192
There's nothing l can say
that will explain it for you.

385
00:37:26.443 --> 00:37:27.610
Come with me.

386
00:37:27.902 --> 00:37:29.195
See for yourself.

387
00:37:29.738 --> 00:37:31.489
This is my ship.

388
00:37:31.781 --> 00:37:34.701
The <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>
lt's a hovercraft.

389
00:37:37.537 --> 00:37:39.289
This is the main deck.

390
00:37:45.295 --> 00:37:46.296
This is the core...

391
00:37:48.798 --> 00:37:52.552
...where we broadcast our pirate signal
and hack into the Matrix.

392
00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:59.100
Most of my crew you already know.

393
00:38:04.105 --> 00:38:05.523
This is Apoc...

394
00:38:06.316 --> 00:38:07.650
...Switch...

395
00:38:09.235 --> 00:38:10.403
...and Cypher.

396
00:38:10.653 --> 00:38:14.365
The ones you don't know:
Tank and his big brother, Dozer.

397
00:38:15.241 --> 00:38:17.660
The little one behind you is Mouse.

398
00:38:21.998 --> 00:38:25.251
You wanted to know
what the Matrix is?

399
00:38:26.294 --> 00:38:27.504
Trinity.

400
00:38:48.525 --> 00:38:50.110
Try to relax.

401
00:38:54.989 --> 00:38:56.825
This will feel a little weird.

402
00:39:08.795 --> 00:39:09.963
This...

403
00:39:10.338 --> 00:39:12.048
...is the Construct.

404
00:39:12.465 --> 00:39:14.592
lt's our loading program.

405
00:39:14.843 --> 00:39:17.303
We can load anything, from clothing...

406
00:39:17.554 --> 00:39:18.930
...to equipment...

407
00:39:19.222 --> 00:39:20.557
...weapons...

408
00:39:21.182 --> 00:39:23.017
...training simulations...

409
00:39:23.393 --> 00:39:25.937
...anything we need.

410
00:39:28.732 --> 00:39:31.151
Right now we're inside
a computer program?

411
00:39:31.443 --> 00:39:33.361
ls it really so hard to believe?

412
00:39:33.862 --> 00:39:36.489
Your clothes are different.
The plugs in your body are gone.

413
00:39:37.699 --> 00:39:39.784
Your hair has changed.

414
00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:43.496
Your appearance now is what we call
''residual self-image. ''

415
00:39:44.205 --> 00:39:46.833
lt is the mental projection
of your digital self.

416
00:39:52.714 --> 00:39:53.840
This isn't real?

417
00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:55.633
What is ''real''?

418
00:39:56.009 --> 00:39:58.261
How do you define ''real''?

419
00:39:58.553 --> 00:40:00.472
lf you're talking about
what you can feel...

420
00:40:00.722 --> 00:40:03.141
...what you can smell, taste and see...

421
00:40:03.391 --> 00:40:07.270
...then ''real'' is simply electrical
signals interpreted by your brain.

422
00:40:11.441 --> 00:40:13.860
This is the world that you know.

423
00:40:15.278 --> 00:40:18.323
The world as it was at the end
of the 20th century.

424
00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:25.038
lt exists now only as part of
a neural-interactive simulation...

425
00:40:25.288 --> 00:40:26.539
...that we call the Matrix.

426
00:40:31.086 --> 00:40:33.922
You've been living
in a dream world, Neo.

427
00:40:34.881 --> 00:40:36.007
This is the world...

428
00:40:36.299 --> 00:40:38.093
...as it exists today.

429
00:40:51.106 --> 00:40:54.067
Welcome to ''the desert...

430
00:40:54.943 --> 00:40:56.528
...of the real. ''

431
00:40:59.906 --> 00:41:02.283
We have only bits and pieces
of information.

432
00:41:02.534 --> 00:41:06.329
But what we know for certain
is that in the early 21st century...

433
00:41:06.579 --> 00:41:09.833
...all of mankind was united
in celebration.

434
00:41:10.083 --> 00:41:14.838
We marveled at our own magnificence
as we gave birth to Al.

435
00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:16.756
Al.

436
00:41:17.799 --> 00:41:19.175
You mean artificial intelligence.

437
00:41:19.426 --> 00:41:23.847
A singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines.

438
00:41:24.681 --> 00:41:28.143
We don't know who struck first,
us or them.

439
00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.771
But we know that it was us
that scorched the sky.

440
00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.608
They were dependent on solar power...

441
00:41:35.859 --> 00:41:39.195
...and it was believed that
they would be unable to survive...

442
00:41:39.529 --> 00:41:43.032
...without an energy source
as abundant as the sun.

443
00:41:43.283 --> 00:41:48.163
Throughout human history, we have been
dependent on machines to survive.

444
00:41:49.622 --> 00:41:53.835
Fate, it seems, is not
without a sense of irony.

445
00:41:57.047 --> 00:42:01.468
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.

446
00:42:01.718 --> 00:42:05.847
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.

447
00:42:07.766 --> 00:42:09.934
Combined with a form of fusion...

448
00:42:10.268 --> 00:42:15.106
...the machines had found all the energy
they would ever need.

449
00:42:19.152 --> 00:42:22.906
There are fields, Neo,
endless fields...

450
00:42:23.156 --> 00:42:26.409
...where human beings
are no longer born.

451
00:42:27.118 --> 00:42:28.953
We are grown.

452
00:42:35.001 --> 00:42:37.587
For the longest time,
l wouldn't believe it.

453
00:42:37.837 --> 00:42:40.507
And then l saw the fields
with my own eyes...

454
00:42:41.841 --> 00:42:43.468
...watched them liquefy the dead...

455
00:42:43.718 --> 00:42:47.055
...so they could be fed intravenously
to the living.

456
00:42:47.597 --> 00:42:51.851
And standing there,
facing the pure, horrifying precision...

457
00:42:52.102 --> 00:42:55.021
...l came to realize
the obviousness of the truth.

458
00:42:57.649 --> 00:42:59.442
What is the Matrix?

459
00:43:00.652 --> 00:43:01.694
Control.

460
00:43:03.071 --> 00:43:06.449
The Matrix is a computer-generated
dream world...

461
00:43:07.242 --> 00:43:10.328
...built to keep us under control...

462
00:43:11.496 --> 00:43:14.666
...in order to change a human being...

463
00:43:15.291 --> 00:43:16.459
...into this.

464
00:43:17.836 --> 00:43:18.962
No.

465
00:43:20.588 --> 00:43:22.173
l don't believe it.

466
00:43:22.549 --> 00:43:23.758
lt's not possible.

467
00:43:24.342 --> 00:43:28.930
l didn't say it would be easy, Neo.
l just said it would be the truth.

468
00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:30.180
Stop!

469
00:43:31.015 --> 00:43:32.225
Let me out!

470
00:43:32.934 --> 00:43:34.853
Let me out! l want out!

471
00:43:36.813 --> 00:43:39.482
- Easy, Neo. Easy.
- Get this thing out of me.

472
00:43:39.733 --> 00:43:41.401
Get this thing out of me!

473
00:43:43.194 --> 00:43:44.696
Don't touch me!

474
00:43:44.946 --> 00:43:46.573
Stay away from me!

475
00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:48.491
l don't believe it.

476
00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:50.410
l don't believe it.

477
00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:51.661
l don't believe it.

478
00:43:52.412 --> 00:43:54.456
- He's gonna pop.
- Breathe, Neo.

479
00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.040
Just breathe.

480
00:44:14.309 --> 00:44:16.102
l can't go back, can l?

481
00:44:17.062 --> 00:44:18.062
No.

482
00:44:19.189 --> 00:44:20.398
But if you could...

483
00:44:21.232 --> 00:44:22.734
...would you really want to?

484
00:44:25.236 --> 00:44:26.654
l owe you an apology.

485
00:44:27.197 --> 00:44:28.573
We have a rule.

486
00:44:29.032 --> 00:44:32.410
We never free a mind
once it's reached a certain age.

487
00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:33.660
lt's dangerous.

488
00:44:34.245 --> 00:44:35.955
The mind has trouble letting go.

489
00:44:36.206 --> 00:44:38.500
l've seen it before, and l'm sorry.

490
00:44:39.542 --> 00:44:41.628
l did what l did because...

491
00:44:42.337 --> 00:44:43.797
...l had to.

492
00:44:52.222 --> 00:44:56.309
When the Matrix was first built,
there was a man born inside...

493
00:44:56.810 --> 00:45:00.605
...who had the ability
to change whatever he wanted...

494
00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:03.900
...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.

495
00:45:05.652 --> 00:45:09.114
lt was he who freed the first of us...

496
00:45:09.989 --> 00:45:11.616
...taught us the truth.

497
00:45:13.076 --> 00:45:16.162
As long as the Matrix exists...

498
00:45:16.496 --> 00:45:18.581
...the human race will never be free.

499
00:45:22.794 --> 00:45:24.337
After he died...

500
00:45:25.088 --> 00:45:27.799
...the Oracle prophesied his return...

501
00:45:28.341 --> 00:45:31.553
...and that his coming would hail
the destruction of the Matrix...

502
00:45:31.803 --> 00:45:33.471
...end the war...

503
00:45:33.805 --> 00:45:35.014
...bring freedom to our people.

504
00:45:36.391 --> 00:45:41.020
That is why there are those of us who
spent our lives searching the Matrix...

505
00:45:41.354 --> 00:45:42.939
...looking for him.

506
00:45:45.358 --> 00:45:47.444
l did what l did because...

507
00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:51.197
...l believe that search is over.

508
00:45:56.286 --> 00:45:57.704
Get some rest.

509
00:45:58.329 --> 00:46:00.123
You're going to need it.

510
00:46:03.043 --> 00:46:04.043
For what?

511
00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:08.131
Your training.

512
00:46:26.441 --> 00:46:28.151
Morning. Did you sleep?

513
00:46:29.027 --> 00:46:30.236
You will tonight.

514
00:46:30.612 --> 00:46:32.155
l guarantee it.

515
00:46:33.656 --> 00:46:35.575
l'm Tank. l'll be your operator.

516
00:46:36.034 --> 00:46:38.453
- You don't have any...
- Holes? Nope.

517
00:46:39.371 --> 00:46:44.084
Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100@/@ pure,
old-fashioned, homegrown human.

518
00:46:44.334 --> 00:46:45.543
Born free right here...

519
00:46:46.086 --> 00:46:47.420
...in the real world.

520
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:49.339
Genuine child of Zion.

521
00:46:50.173 --> 00:46:52.634
- Zion?
- lf the war was over tomorrow...

522
00:46:52.884 --> 00:46:54.302
...Zion's where the party would be.

523
00:46:54.803 --> 00:46:56.096
lt's a city?

524
00:46:56.346 --> 00:46:59.516
The last human city.
The only place we have left.

525
00:47:01.101 --> 00:47:02.352
Where is it?

526
00:47:04.104 --> 00:47:05.105
Deep underground...

527
00:47:05.355 --> 00:47:07.524
...near the Earth's core,
where it's still warm.

528
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:11.027
You live long enough,
you might see it.

529
00:47:13.279 --> 00:47:18.118
Goddamn! l gotta tell you, l'm excited
to see what you're capable of...

530
00:47:18.368 --> 00:47:20.120
...if Morpheus is right and all.

531
00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:23.373
We're not supposed to
talk about this, but...

532
00:47:23.623 --> 00:47:25.041
...if you are...

533
00:47:26.126 --> 00:47:28.128
...it's a very exciting time.

534
00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:31.881
We got a lot to do.
We gotta get to it.

535
00:47:35.802 --> 00:47:38.722
We're supposed to start
with these programs first.

536
00:47:39.723 --> 00:47:43.184
That's major boring shit.
Let's do something more fun.

537
00:47:43.518 --> 00:47:45.019
How about...

538
00:47:46.563 --> 00:47:48.314
...combat training?

539
00:47:54.362 --> 00:47:55.822
''Jujitsu''?

540
00:47:56.698 --> 00:47:58.366
l'm going to learn jujitsu?

541
00:48:09.711 --> 00:48:10.920
Holy shit!

542
00:48:11.171 --> 00:48:13.506
''Hey, Mikey, l think he likes it. ''

543
00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:15.133
How about some more?

544
00:48:15.383 --> 00:48:16.676
Hell, yes.

545
00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:19.970
Hell, yeah.

546
00:48:32.192 --> 00:48:33.192
How is he?

547
00:48:33.369 --> 00:48:35.769
Ten hours straight.
He's a machine.

548
00:48:46.706 --> 00:48:48.083
l know kung fu.

549
00:48:49.959 --> 00:48:50.959
Show me.

550
00:48:52.545 --> 00:48:54.297
This is a sparring program...

551
00:48:54.547 --> 00:48:57.342
...similar to the programmed reality
of the Matrix.

552
00:48:57.592 --> 00:48:59.928
lt has the same basic rules.
Like gravity.

553
00:49:00.178 --> 00:49:03.640
These rules are no different
than those of a computer system.

554
00:49:04.182 --> 00:49:05.683
Some of them can be bent.

555
00:49:05.892 --> 00:49:06.892
Others...

556
00:49:06.976 --> 00:49:08.353
...can be broken.

557
00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:10.020
Understand?

558
00:49:11.272 --> 00:49:12.272
Then hit me...

559
00:49:12.690 --> 00:49:13.817
...if you can.

560
00:49:52.981 --> 00:49:53.981
Good!

561
00:49:54.683 --> 00:49:55.851
Adaptation.

562
00:49:56.143 --> 00:49:57.353
lmprovisation.

563
00:49:57.645 --> 00:49:58.979
But your weakness...

564
00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:00.606
...is not your technique.

565
00:50:07.571 --> 00:50:09.657
Morpheus is fighting Neo.

566
00:51:21.937 --> 00:51:23.105
How did l beat you?

567
00:51:29.695 --> 00:51:30.779
You're too fast.

568
00:51:31.322 --> 00:51:32.656
Do you believe that...

569
00:51:33.032 --> 00:51:35.534
...my being stronger or faster...

570
00:51:35.784 --> 00:51:39.455
...has anything to do
with my muscles in this place?

571
00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:45.294
You think you're breathing air?

572
00:51:58.807 --> 00:52:00.017
Again!

573
00:52:11.487 --> 00:52:13.906
Jesus Christ, he's fast!

574
00:52:14.156 --> 00:52:16.367
His neuro-kinetics
are way above normal.

575
00:52:21.830 --> 00:52:23.290
What are you waiting for?

576
00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:25.501
You're faster than this.

577
00:52:27.711 --> 00:52:29.922
Don't think you are.

578
00:52:30.172 --> 00:52:31.840
Know you are.

579
00:52:42.226 --> 00:52:45.062
Come on! Stop trying to hit me,
and hit me!

580
00:52:54.947 --> 00:52:56.699
l don't believe it.

581
00:52:58.242 --> 00:53:00.369
l know what you're trying to do.

582
00:53:02.037 --> 00:53:04.206
l'm trying to free your mind, Neo.

583
00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:06.625
But l can only show you the door.

584
00:53:07.209 --> 00:53:09.128
You have to walk through it.

585
00:53:11.422 --> 00:53:13.549
Tank, load the jump program.

586
00:53:25.144 --> 00:53:27.855
You have to let it all go, Neo.
Fear...

587
00:53:28.397 --> 00:53:30.566
...doubt and disbelief.

588
00:53:31.734 --> 00:53:34.445
Free your mind.

589
00:53:50.628 --> 00:53:52.338
Okey-dokey.

590
00:53:54.423 --> 00:53:55.591
Free my mind.

591
00:53:56.175 --> 00:53:57.176
What if he makes it?

592
00:53:57.426 --> 00:54:00.137
- No one's ever made their first jump.
- l know.

593
00:54:01.472 --> 00:54:03.933
- But what if he does?
- He won't.

594
00:54:04.767 --> 00:54:05.767
Come on.

595
00:54:05.851 --> 00:54:07.019
All right.

596
00:54:07.478 --> 00:54:09.521
No problem. Free my mind.

597
00:54:10.314 --> 00:54:13.108
Free my mind. No problem. Right.

598
00:54:32.503 --> 00:54:34.171
What does that mean?

599
00:54:34.546 --> 00:54:36.382
lt doesn't mean anything.

600
00:54:36.966 --> 00:54:39.551
Everybody falls the first time.

601
00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:41.303
Right, Trin?

602
00:55:01.991 --> 00:55:04.618
- l thought it wasn't real.
- Your mind makes it real.

603
00:55:07.871 --> 00:55:10.124
lf you're killed in the Matrix...

604
00:55:10.499 --> 00:55:11.499
...you die here?

605
00:55:11.959 --> 00:55:14.420
The body cannot live without the mind.

606
00:55:44.909 --> 00:55:48.287
l don't remember you ever
bringing me dinner.

607
00:55:51.373 --> 00:55:54.209
There is something about him,
isn't there?

608
00:55:54.835 --> 00:55:56.462
You're a believer now?

609
00:55:57.463 --> 00:55:58.672
l keep wondering...

610
00:55:58.923 --> 00:56:02.593
...if Morpheus is so sure,
why not take him to see the Oracle?

611
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:06.430
Morpheus will take him
when he's ready.

612
00:56:16.232 --> 00:56:17.775
The Matrix is a system, Neo.

613
00:56:19.526 --> 00:56:20.819
That system is our enemy.

614
00:56:21.445 --> 00:56:23.781
But when you're inside,
what do you see?

615
00:56:24.031 --> 00:56:27.826
Businessmen, teachers,
lawyers, carpenters.

616
00:56:28.285 --> 00:56:30.871
The very minds of the people
we are trying to save.

617
00:56:31.121 --> 00:56:34.083
But until we do, these people are
a part of that system...

618
00:56:34.333 --> 00:56:36.252
...and that makes them our enemy.

619
00:56:36.627 --> 00:56:37.628
You have to understand...

620
00:56:37.878 --> 00:56:41.215
...most of these people are not
ready to be unplugged.

621
00:56:41.465 --> 00:56:43.050
And many of them are so inert...

622
00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:44.510
...so hopelessly dependent
on the system...

623
00:56:44.551 --> 00:56:45.719
...so hopelessly dependent
on the system...

624
00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:48.681
...that they will fight to protect it.

625
00:56:50.182 --> 00:56:53.936
Were you listening to me or looking
at the woman in the red dress?

626
00:56:54.937 --> 00:56:55.937
Look again.

627
00:56:57.106 --> 00:56:58.190
Freeze it.

628
00:57:04.822 --> 00:57:06.448
This isn't the Matrix?

629
00:57:08.242 --> 00:57:12.079
lt's another training program
designed to teach you one thing:

630
00:57:12.705 --> 00:57:15.124
lf you are not one of us,
you are one of them.

631
00:57:15.666 --> 00:57:18.460
- What are they?
- Sentient programs.

632
00:57:19.211 --> 00:57:23.507
They can move in and out of any software
still hardwired to their system.

633
00:57:23.882 --> 00:57:27.261
That means that anyone
we haven't unplugged...

634
00:57:27.595 --> 00:57:28.929
...is potentially an agent.

635
00:57:29.888 --> 00:57:31.724
lnside the Matrix...

636
00:57:32.308 --> 00:57:34.018
...they are everyone...

637
00:57:34.351 --> 00:57:36.061
...and they are no one.

638
00:57:36.312 --> 00:57:39.440
We have survived by hiding
and running from them...

639
00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:41.317
...but they are the gatekeepers.

640
00:57:41.567 --> 00:57:44.528
They're guarding all the doors
and holding all the keys.

641
00:57:44.778 --> 00:57:47.615
Sooner or later, someone will
have to fight them.

642
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.991
Someone?

643
00:57:49.325 --> 00:57:50.743
l won't lie to you, Neo.

644
00:57:51.201 --> 00:57:56.040
Every single man or woman who
has fought an agent has died.

645
00:57:56.290 --> 00:57:58.667
But where they have failed,
you will succeed.

646
00:57:59.084 --> 00:58:00.084
Why?

647
00:58:00.169 --> 00:58:02.463
l've seen an agent punch
through a concrete wall.

648
00:58:02.713 --> 00:58:06.300
Men have emptied entire clips at them
and hit nothing but air.

649
00:58:06.550 --> 00:58:11.180
Yet their strength and speed are still
based in a world built on rules.

650
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:12.556
Because of that...

651
00:58:12.806 --> 00:58:16.185
...they will never be as strong
or as fast as you can be.

652
00:58:20.481 --> 00:58:22.358
What are you telling me?

653
00:58:23.067 --> 00:58:24.526
That l can dodge bullets?

654
00:58:26.528 --> 00:58:27.905
No, Neo.

655
00:58:28.405 --> 00:58:31.325
l'm trying to tell you
that when you're ready...

656
00:58:32.201 --> 00:58:33.577
...you won't have to.

657
00:58:38.082 --> 00:58:39.082
<i>We got trouble.</i>

658
00:58:57.810 --> 00:58:59.186
Did Zion send the warning?

659
00:58:59.436 --> 00:59:00.436
No, another ship.

660
00:59:03.524 --> 00:59:04.817
Shit.

661
00:59:05.067 --> 00:59:06.819
Squiddy's sweeping in quick.

662
00:59:07.111 --> 00:59:08.111
Squiddy?

663
00:59:08.153 --> 00:59:11.365
A sentinel. A killing machine
designed for one thing.

664
00:59:11.615 --> 00:59:12.825
Search and destroy.

665
00:59:14.159 --> 00:59:15.327
Set her down there.

666
00:59:37.141 --> 00:59:38.141
How are we doing, Tank?

667
00:59:46.817 --> 00:59:47.985
Power off-line.

668
00:59:48.485 --> 00:59:50.487
EMP armed...

669
00:59:50.988 --> 00:59:52.531
...and ready.

670
00:59:52.823 --> 00:59:54.700
Electromagnetic pulse.

671
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:57.828
Disables any electrical system
in the blast radius.

672
00:59:58.078 --> 01:00:00.289
lt's the only weapon we have
against the machines.

673
01:00:06.086 --> 01:00:07.086
Where are we?

674
01:00:07.171 --> 01:00:09.214
Their old service and waste systems.

675
01:00:10.758 --> 01:00:11.758
Sewers.

676
01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.511
There used to be cities
that spanned hundreds of miles.

677
01:00:15.012 --> 01:00:16.931
Now these sewers are
all that's left.

678
01:00:17.181 --> 01:00:18.515
Quiet.

679
01:01:02.393 --> 01:01:04.562
You scared the bejesus out of me.

680
01:01:05.646 --> 01:01:07.565
- Sorry.
- lt's okay.

681
01:01:10.484 --> 01:01:11.484
ls that...?

682
01:01:11.569 --> 01:01:13.153
The Matrix?

683
01:01:16.323 --> 01:01:19.493
- Do you always look at it encoded?
- Well, you have to.

684
01:01:19.743 --> 01:01:22.830
The image translators work
for the construct program.

685
01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:26.500
But there's way too much information
to decode the Matrix.

686
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:29.712
You get used to it.
l don't even see the code.

687
01:01:29.962 --> 01:01:33.382
All l see is blonde, brunette, redhead.

688
01:01:34.550 --> 01:01:35.926
Do you...

689
01:01:36.218 --> 01:01:37.303
...want a drink?

690
01:01:37.553 --> 01:01:38.596
Sure.

691
01:01:42.141 --> 01:01:43.601
You know...

692
01:01:44.518 --> 01:01:46.061
...l know what you're thinking.

693
01:01:46.312 --> 01:01:48.439
Because right now l'm thinking
the same thing.

694
01:01:48.731 --> 01:01:52.067
Actually, l've been thinking it
ever since l got here.

695
01:01:53.986 --> 01:01:56.989
Why, oh, why didn't l take
the blue pill?

696
01:02:09.376 --> 01:02:11.295
Good shit, huh?

697
01:02:11.629 --> 01:02:12.838
Dozer makes it.

698
01:02:13.297 --> 01:02:14.465
lt's good for two things:

699
01:02:14.715 --> 01:02:17.801
Degreasing engines and
killing brain cells.

700
01:02:18.802 --> 01:02:21.013
So can l ask you something?

701
01:02:24.016 --> 01:02:25.643
Did he tell you why he did it?

702
01:02:28.270 --> 01:02:30.105
Why you're here?

703
01:02:33.776 --> 01:02:35.527
Jesus!

704
01:02:36.737 --> 01:02:38.656
What a mind job.

705
01:02:40.074 --> 01:02:42.868
So you're here to save the world.

706
01:02:44.370 --> 01:02:46.455
What do you say
to something like that?

707
01:02:51.627 --> 01:02:53.003
A little piece of advice.

708
01:02:54.797 --> 01:02:56.215
You see an agent...

709
01:02:56.548 --> 01:02:58.842
...you do what we do:

710
01:02:59.176 --> 01:03:00.719
Run.

711
01:03:01.053 --> 01:03:02.805
You run your ass off.

712
01:03:10.062 --> 01:03:11.772
Thanks for the drink.

713
01:03:16.485 --> 01:03:17.653
Sweet dreams.

714
01:03:21.657 --> 01:03:25.077
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

715
01:03:25.744 --> 01:03:26.870
You know...

716
01:03:28.289 --> 01:03:30.749
...l know this steak doesn't exist.

717
01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:34.503
l know that when l put it
in my mouth...

718
01:03:34.753 --> 01:03:37.840
...the Matrix is telling my brain
that it is...

719
01:03:38.132 --> 01:03:39.258
...juicy...

720
01:03:39.550 --> 01:03:41.260
...and delicious.

721
01:03:44.179 --> 01:03:45.431
After nine years...

722
01:03:46.473 --> 01:03:48.017
...you know what l realize?

723
01:03:55.858 --> 01:03:57.067
lgnorance is bliss.

724
01:04:02.114 --> 01:04:03.949
Then we have a deal.

725
01:04:06.452 --> 01:04:08.370
l don't want to remember nothing.

726
01:04:08.621 --> 01:04:09.621
Nothing.

727
01:04:09.997 --> 01:04:11.165
You understand?

728
01:04:15.210 --> 01:04:17.004
And l want to be rich.

729
01:04:18.339 --> 01:04:21.050
You know, someone important.

730
01:04:22.551 --> 01:04:23.677
Like an actor.

731
01:04:24.887 --> 01:04:28.015
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

732
01:04:30.184 --> 01:04:31.727
Okay.

733
01:04:32.102 --> 01:04:34.521
You get my body
back in a power plant...

734
01:04:34.897 --> 01:04:36.649
...reinsert me into the Matrix...

735
01:04:36.982 --> 01:04:38.400
...l'll get you what you want.

736
01:04:38.651 --> 01:04:40.653
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.

737
01:04:40.903 --> 01:04:43.072
No. l told you, l don't know them.

738
01:04:46.033 --> 01:04:48.035
l can get you the man who does.

739
01:04:48.786 --> 01:04:50.579
Morpheus.

740
01:05:00.673 --> 01:05:04.134
Here you go, buddy.
Breakfast of champions.

741
01:05:05.469 --> 01:05:08.264
Close your eyes, it feels
like you're eating runny eggs.

742
01:05:08.514 --> 01:05:09.514
Or a bowl of snot.

743
01:05:10.724 --> 01:05:12.309
You know what it reminds me of?

744
01:05:14.144 --> 01:05:16.480
Tastee Wheat. Did you
ever eat Tastee Wheat?

745
01:05:17.106 --> 01:05:18.816
No, but technically,
neither did you.

746
01:05:19.066 --> 01:05:21.110
That's exactly my point. Exactly.

747
01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:22.736
Because you have to wonder...

748
01:05:22.987 --> 01:05:26.240
...how do the machines really know
what Tastee Wheat tasted like?

749
01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:27.908
Maybe they got it wrong.

750
01:05:28.158 --> 01:05:31.370
Maybe what l think Tastee Wheat
tasted like actually tasted like...

751
01:05:31.662 --> 01:05:33.664
...oatmeal or tuna fish.

752
01:05:34.039 --> 01:05:36.875
That makes you wonder.
Take chicken, for example.

753
01:05:37.126 --> 01:05:39.128
Maybe they didn't know
what to make it taste like...

754
01:05:39.378 --> 01:05:41.422
...which is why it tastes
like everything.

755
01:05:41.672 --> 01:05:43.465
- And maybe they...
- Shut up.

756
01:05:45.092 --> 01:05:46.552
lt's a single-celled protein...

757
01:05:46.802 --> 01:05:49.847
...combined with synthetic aminos,
vitamins and minerals.

758
01:05:50.097 --> 01:05:51.348
Everything the body needs.

759
01:05:51.599 --> 01:05:54.476
lt doesn't have everything
the body needs.

760
01:05:57.229 --> 01:06:00.316
l understand you've run through
the agent training program.

761
01:06:01.358 --> 01:06:03.402
You know, l wrote that program.

762
01:06:03.694 --> 01:06:04.987
Here it comes.

763
01:06:05.237 --> 01:06:07.197
- What did you think of her?
- Of who?

764
01:06:07.573 --> 01:06:10.618
The woman in the red dress.
l designed her.

765
01:06:10.951 --> 01:06:13.704
She doesn't talk very much...

766
01:06:13.954 --> 01:06:17.917
...but if you'd like to meet her,
l can arrange a more personal milieu.

767
01:06:18.167 --> 01:06:19.543
The digital pimp hard at work.

768
01:06:19.793 --> 01:06:22.046
Pay no attention to
these hypocrites, Neo.

769
01:06:23.339 --> 01:06:25.174
To deny our own impulses...

770
01:06:25.424 --> 01:06:28.552
...is to deny the very thing
that makes us human.

771
01:06:30.471 --> 01:06:31.847
Dozer, when you're done...

772
01:06:32.097 --> 01:06:33.515
...bring the ship up to broadcast depth.

773
01:06:34.225 --> 01:06:35.559
We're going in.

774
01:06:36.268 --> 01:06:37.686
l'm taking Neo to see her.

775
01:06:42.024 --> 01:06:43.024
See who?

776
01:06:43.859 --> 01:06:45.110
The Oracle.

777
01:06:50.616 --> 01:06:52.159
Everyone, please observe...

778
01:06:52.493 --> 01:06:55.204
...the ''fasten seat belt''
and ''no smoking'' signs are on.

779
01:06:55.704 --> 01:06:59.083
Sit back and enjoy your flight.

780
01:07:23.607 --> 01:07:24.607
We're in.

781
01:07:40.165 --> 01:07:41.292
We'll be back in an hour.

782
01:07:56.098 --> 01:07:57.516
Unbelievable...

783
01:07:58.350 --> 01:07:59.685
...isn't it?

784
01:08:03.272 --> 01:08:05.107
- God!
- What?

785
01:08:05.774 --> 01:08:07.151
l used to eat there.

786
01:08:09.403 --> 01:08:11.030
Really good noodles.

787
01:08:15.826 --> 01:08:18.329
l have these memories from my life.

788
01:08:20.789 --> 01:08:22.458
None of them happened.

789
01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:24.500
What does that mean?

790
01:08:24.668 --> 01:08:26.879
That the Matrix cannot tell you
who you are.

791
01:08:27.796 --> 01:08:29.006
But an oracle can?

792
01:08:29.465 --> 01:08:30.674
That's different.

793
01:08:35.763 --> 01:08:36.763
Did you go to her?

794
01:08:38.182 --> 01:08:39.350
Yes.

795
01:08:39.850 --> 01:08:41.227
What did she tell you?

796
01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:45.981
She told me...

797
01:08:47.024 --> 01:08:48.192
What?

798
01:08:51.987 --> 01:08:53.322
We're here.

799
01:08:54.573 --> 01:08:55.991
Come with me.

800
01:09:15.970 --> 01:09:18.639
So is this the same oracle
that made...

801
01:09:18.973 --> 01:09:19.973
...the prophecy?

802
01:09:20.057 --> 01:09:24.395
Yes. She's very old. She's been
with us since the beginning.

803
01:09:24.853 --> 01:09:25.853
The beginning?

804
01:09:25.896 --> 01:09:26.896
Of the Resistance.

805
01:09:29.108 --> 01:09:31.485
And she knows what? Everything?

806
01:09:33.529 --> 01:09:35.447
She would say she knows enough.

807
01:09:36.574 --> 01:09:38.367
And she's never wrong.

808
01:09:40.578 --> 01:09:43.747
Try not to think of it
in terms of right and wrong.

809
01:09:44.081 --> 01:09:45.666
She is a guide, Neo.

810
01:09:46.041 --> 01:09:47.918
She can help you to find the path.

811
01:09:48.711 --> 01:09:49.711
She helped you?

812
01:09:52.172 --> 01:09:53.507
What did she tell you?

813
01:09:55.968 --> 01:09:58.178
That l would find the One.

814
01:10:11.317 --> 01:10:13.444
l told you l can only
show you the door.

815
01:10:14.153 --> 01:10:16.238
You have to walk through it.

816
01:10:20.034 --> 01:10:21.118
Hello, Neo.

817
01:10:21.368 --> 01:10:23.037
You're right on time.

818
01:10:30.961 --> 01:10:34.757
Make yourself at home, Morpheus.
Neo, come with me.

819
01:10:40.429 --> 01:10:42.014
These are the other Potentials.

820
01:10:42.264 --> 01:10:43.807
You can wait here.

821
01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:27.184
Do not try and bend the spoon.

822
01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:29.687
That's impossible.

823
01:11:30.521 --> 01:11:34.525
lnstead, only try
to realize the truth.

824
01:11:35.067 --> 01:11:36.443
What truth?

825
01:11:36.694 --> 01:11:38.362
There is no spoon.

826
01:11:40.948 --> 01:11:42.283
There is no spoon?

827
01:11:42.533 --> 01:11:47.037
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon
that bends. lt is only yourself.

828
01:12:03.053 --> 01:12:04.555
The Oracle will you see now.

829
01:12:15.232 --> 01:12:16.775
l know you're Neo.

830
01:12:17.401 --> 01:12:18.569
Be right with you.

831
01:12:19.612 --> 01:12:20.613
You're the Oracle?

832
01:12:20.988 --> 01:12:21.989
Bingo.

833
01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:27.578
Not quite what you
were expecting, right?

834
01:12:28.621 --> 01:12:30.789
Almost done.

835
01:12:33.292 --> 01:12:34.919
Smell good, don't they?

836
01:12:37.671 --> 01:12:39.506
l'd ask you to sit down...

837
01:12:39.757 --> 01:12:42.134
...but you're not going to anyway.

838
01:12:42.635 --> 01:12:44.470
And don't worry about the vase.

839
01:12:44.678 --> 01:12:45.678
What vase?

840
01:12:48.641 --> 01:12:49.808
That vase.

841
01:12:50.768 --> 01:12:51.810
l'm sorry.

842
01:12:52.061 --> 01:12:53.938
l said, don't worry about it.

843
01:12:55.105 --> 01:12:57.066
l'll get one of my kids to fix it.

844
01:12:57.691 --> 01:12:58.901
How did you know?

845
01:13:00.945 --> 01:13:04.740
What's really going to bake
your noodle later on is...

846
01:13:05.074 --> 01:13:08.035
...would you still have broken it
if l hadn't said anything?

847
01:13:12.831 --> 01:13:14.750
You're cuter than l thought.

848
01:13:17.795 --> 01:13:20.047
l can see why she likes you.

849
01:13:20.923 --> 01:13:22.007
Who?

850
01:13:22.258 --> 01:13:24.093
Not too bright, though.

851
01:13:27.388 --> 01:13:30.474
You know why Morpheus
brought you to see me.

852
01:13:32.601 --> 01:13:33.769
So...

853
01:13:34.728 --> 01:13:36.105
...what do you think?

854
01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:39.692
Do you think you are the One?

855
01:13:41.652 --> 01:13:42.695
l don't know.

856
01:13:46.115 --> 01:13:47.533
You know what that means?

857
01:13:48.367 --> 01:13:49.535
lt's Latin.

858
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:52.121
Means, ''Know thyself. ''

859
01:13:53.581 --> 01:13:55.541
l'll let you in on a little secret.

860
01:13:57.793 --> 01:14:01.630
Being the One is just
like being in love.

861
01:14:02.339 --> 01:14:05.217
No one can tell you you're in love.
You just know it...

862
01:14:05.467 --> 01:14:06.594
...through and through.

863
01:14:06.927 --> 01:14:08.971
Balls to bones.

864
01:14:11.515 --> 01:14:12.515
Well...

865
01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:16.395
...l'd better have a look at you.

866
01:14:17.730 --> 01:14:19.231
Open your mouth. Say, ''Ah. ''

867
01:14:33.621 --> 01:14:35.289
Okay...

868
01:14:35.915 --> 01:14:40.878
Now l'm supposed to say,
''Hmm, that's interesting, but... ''

869
01:14:41.378 --> 01:14:42.504
Then you say:

870
01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:44.381
But what?

871
01:14:44.632 --> 01:14:48.594
But you already know
what l'm going to tell you.

872
01:14:50.012 --> 01:14:51.013
l'm not the One.

873
01:14:51.263 --> 01:14:52.973
Sorry, kid.

874
01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:56.602
You got the gift...

875
01:14:57.603 --> 01:14:59.813
...but it looks like
you're waiting for something.

876
01:15:04.693 --> 01:15:05.693
What?

877
01:15:05.736 --> 01:15:08.656
Your next life, maybe. Who knows?

878
01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:11.492
That's the way these things go.

879
01:15:12.368 --> 01:15:13.368
What's funny?

880
01:15:13.619 --> 01:15:14.954
Morpheus.

881
01:15:18.415 --> 01:15:20.125
He almost had me convinced.

882
01:15:20.376 --> 01:15:21.502
l know.

883
01:15:23.045 --> 01:15:25.172
Poor Morpheus.

884
01:15:27.549 --> 01:15:30.678
Without him, we're lost.

885
01:15:32.221 --> 01:15:34.390
What do you mean, ''without him''?

886
01:15:38.394 --> 01:15:40.312
Are you sure you want
to hear this?

887
01:15:42.523 --> 01:15:45.276
Morpheus believes in you, Neo.

888
01:15:46.986 --> 01:15:49.154
And no one, not you, not even me...

889
01:15:49.405 --> 01:15:51.657
...can convince him otherwise.

890
01:15:52.032 --> 01:15:54.410
He believes it so blindly...

891
01:15:54.702 --> 01:15:59.039
...that he's going to sacrifice
his life to save yours.

892
01:15:59.290 --> 01:16:00.290
What?

893
01:16:00.332 --> 01:16:03.252
You're going to
have to make a choice.

894
01:16:03.877 --> 01:16:07.464
ln the one hand,
you'll have Morpheus' life.

895
01:16:07.965 --> 01:16:10.843
And in the other hand,
you'll have your own.

896
01:16:12.261 --> 01:16:14.555
One of you is going to die.

897
01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:19.935
Which one will be up to you.

898
01:16:21.312 --> 01:16:23.230
l'm sorry, kiddo. l really am.

899
01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:25.149
You have a good soul.

900
01:16:26.233 --> 01:16:28.944
And l hate giving
good people bad news.

901
01:16:32.072 --> 01:16:33.532
Don't worry about it.

902
01:16:33.782 --> 01:16:36.201
As soon as you
step outside that door...

903
01:16:36.452 --> 01:16:38.579
...you'll start feeling better.

904
01:16:39.288 --> 01:16:43.083
You'll remember you don't believe
in any of this fate crap.

905
01:16:43.918 --> 01:16:46.670
You're in control of your own life.

906
01:16:47.504 --> 01:16:48.797
Remember?

907
01:16:50.674 --> 01:16:51.675
Here...

908
01:16:53.552 --> 01:16:55.095
...take a cookie.

909
01:16:55.638 --> 01:16:58.974
l promise, by the time
you're done eating it...

910
01:16:59.934 --> 01:17:02.311
...you'll feel right as rain.

911
01:17:11.528 --> 01:17:12.863
What was said...

912
01:17:13.489 --> 01:17:14.949
...was for you...

913
01:17:15.491 --> 01:17:17.326
...and for you alone.

914
01:17:40.266 --> 01:17:41.392
They're on the way.

915
01:18:11.547 --> 01:18:12.547
What is that?

916
01:18:27.146 --> 01:18:28.564
Oh, déja vu.

917
01:18:32.067 --> 01:18:33.152
What did you just say?

918
01:18:33.402 --> 01:18:34.904
Nothing.
Just déja vu.

919
01:18:35.154 --> 01:18:36.780
- What did you see?
- What happened?

920
01:18:38.198 --> 01:18:40.367
A black cat went past us...

921
01:18:40.618 --> 01:18:42.244
...then another just like it.

922
01:18:42.494 --> 01:18:44.038
Was it the same cat?

923
01:18:45.205 --> 01:18:46.206
l'm not sure.

924
01:18:46.999 --> 01:18:47.999
Switch, Apoc.

925
01:18:52.296 --> 01:18:53.296
What is it?

926
01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:57.801
A déja vu is usually a glitch in the
Matrix when they change something.

927
01:19:01.180 --> 01:19:02.180
Oh, my God.

928
01:19:03.849 --> 01:19:04.849
Let's go.

929
01:19:10.064 --> 01:19:11.815
They cut the hard line.
lt's a trap! Get out!

930
01:19:17.738 --> 01:19:18.738
Oh, no.

931
01:19:58.714 --> 01:20:01.133
That's what they changed.
We're trapped.

932
01:20:01.425 --> 01:20:03.260
Be calm. Give me your phone.

933
01:20:03.552 --> 01:20:05.053
They'll be able to track it.

934
01:20:05.345 --> 01:20:06.722
We have no choice.

935
01:20:08.182 --> 01:20:09.349
Operator.

936
01:20:09.725 --> 01:20:12.519
<i>Find a structural drawing of
this building. Find it fast.</i>

937
01:20:20.402 --> 01:20:22.946
- Got it!
<i>- I need the main wet-wall.</i>

938
01:20:26.241 --> 01:20:27.241
Eighth floor.

939
01:20:27.284 --> 01:20:28.827
<i>They're on the eighth floor.</i>

940
01:20:29.161 --> 01:20:30.579
Switch, straight ahead.

941
01:20:49.056 --> 01:20:50.557
<i>Now left. That's it.</i>

942
01:20:50.849 --> 01:20:51.892
Good.

943
01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:02.903
Where are they?

944
01:22:03.338 --> 01:22:04.506
They're in the walls.

945
01:22:05.966 --> 01:22:07.134
ln the walls!

946
01:22:28.530 --> 01:22:29.530
lt's an agent!

947
01:22:39.166 --> 01:22:40.167
You must get Neo out!

948
01:22:40.501 --> 01:22:42.336
He's all that matters!

949
01:22:42.628 --> 01:22:43.837
No, Morpheus! Don't!

950
01:22:44.087 --> 01:22:45.087
Trinity, go!

951
01:22:45.797 --> 01:22:47.174
Go!

952
01:22:53.388 --> 01:22:55.307
- We can't leave him!
- We have to!

953
01:23:20.582 --> 01:23:21.582
Come on!

954
01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:28.920
The great Morpheus.

955
01:23:28.948 --> 01:23:30.648
We meet at last.

956
01:23:30.718 --> 01:23:31.845
And you are?

957
01:23:32.095 --> 01:23:33.847
A Smith.

958
01:23:34.097 --> 01:23:35.390
Agent Smith.

959
01:23:35.974 --> 01:23:38.017
You all look the same to me.

960
01:24:33.615 --> 01:24:34.866
Take him.

961
01:24:48.129 --> 01:24:49.964
- Operator.
<i>- I need an exit, fast.</i>

962
01:24:52.050 --> 01:24:54.969
There was an accident.
Goddamn car accident.

963
01:24:55.303 --> 01:24:57.096
<i>All of a sudden, boom.</i>

964
01:24:57.347 --> 01:24:58.723
Somebody up there still likes me.

965
01:24:58.973 --> 01:25:00.225
l got you.

966
01:25:00.725 --> 01:25:02.644
<i>Just get me out of here fast.</i>

967
01:25:02.894 --> 01:25:05.563
Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie.
An old TV repair shop.

968
01:25:05.813 --> 01:25:06.815
Right.

969
01:25:09.984 --> 01:25:11.569
- Operator.
<i>- Tank, it's me.</i>

970
01:25:11.820 --> 01:25:12.987
ls Morpheus alive?

971
01:25:13.363 --> 01:25:14.614
ls Morpheus alive, Tank?

972
01:25:15.073 --> 01:25:16.991
<i>Yes. They're moving him.
I don't know where.</i>

973
01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:19.494
He's alive. We need an exit.

974
01:25:19.744 --> 01:25:20.744
You're not far from Cypher.

975
01:25:20.912 --> 01:25:22.247
<i>- Cypher?</i>
- l know.

976
01:25:22.497 --> 01:25:24.582
<i>- I sent him to Franklin and Erie.</i>
- Got it.

977
01:25:33.675 --> 01:25:34.843
Got him.

978
01:25:45.812 --> 01:25:46.855
Where are they?

979
01:25:47.105 --> 01:25:48.356
Making the call.

980
01:25:49.023 --> 01:25:50.191
Good.

981
01:26:03.746 --> 01:26:04.746
You first.

982
01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:08.750
Shit!

983
01:26:17.677 --> 01:26:19.846
l don't know. lt just went dead.

984
01:26:46.664 --> 01:26:47.832
<i>Hello, Trinity.</i>

985
01:26:48.291 --> 01:26:49.626
Cypher? Where's Tank?

986
01:26:55.215 --> 01:26:56.257
You know...

987
01:26:57.967 --> 01:27:00.094
...for a long time...

988
01:27:01.304 --> 01:27:04.224
...l thought l was in love with you.

989
01:27:04.974 --> 01:27:07.018
<i>I used to dream about you.</i>

990
01:27:08.102 --> 01:27:10.813
You're a beautiful woman, Trinity.

991
01:27:11.064 --> 01:27:13.441
<i>Too bad things had to
turn out this way.</i>

992
01:27:14.192 --> 01:27:15.192
You killed them.

993
01:27:15.527 --> 01:27:17.028
- What?
- Oh, God.

994
01:27:17.278 --> 01:27:18.696
l'm tired, Trinity.

995
01:27:20.114 --> 01:27:21.991
l'm tired of this war...

996
01:27:22.283 --> 01:27:25.119
...tired of fighting.
l'm tired of this ship...

997
01:27:25.453 --> 01:27:30.083
...of being cold, of eating
the same goddamn goop every day.

998
01:27:32.502 --> 01:27:33.502
But most of all...

999
01:27:34.003 --> 01:27:37.382
<i>...I'm tired of that jackoff
and all of his bullshit.</i>

1000
01:27:38.508 --> 01:27:39.759
Surprise, asshole!

1001
01:27:40.343 --> 01:27:42.554
l bet you never saw this coming...

1002
01:27:42.804 --> 01:27:43.847
...did you?

1003
01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:48.518
God, l wish l could be there...

1004
01:27:49.102 --> 01:27:50.603
...when they break you.

1005
01:27:51.646 --> 01:27:54.816
l wish l could walk in
just when it happens...

1006
01:27:55.525 --> 01:27:57.235
...so right then...

1007
01:27:57.485 --> 01:27:58.820
...you'd know it was me.

1008
01:27:59.529 --> 01:28:00.529
You gave them Morpheus.

1009
01:28:00.738 --> 01:28:02.198
<i>He lied to us, Trinity.</i>

1010
01:28:02.782 --> 01:28:04.284
He tricked us!

1011
01:28:04.826 --> 01:28:06.828
lf you had told us the truth...

1012
01:28:07.078 --> 01:28:09.956
...we would've told you to shove
that red pill up your ass!

1013
01:28:10.206 --> 01:28:12.333
That is not true, Cypher.
He set us free.

1014
01:28:12.584 --> 01:28:13.584
<i>''Free. ''</i>

1015
01:28:13.751 --> 01:28:15.461
You call this free?

1016
01:28:17.881 --> 01:28:20.341
All l do is what he tells me to do.

1017
01:28:21.968 --> 01:28:24.888
lf l had to choose between
that and the Matrix...

1018
01:28:26.055 --> 01:28:27.265
...l choose the Matrix.

1019
01:28:27.515 --> 01:28:29.184
The Matrix isn't real.

1020
01:28:29.434 --> 01:28:30.852
<i>I disagree, Trinity.</i>

1021
01:28:31.102 --> 01:28:33.354
l think the Matrix...

1022
01:28:33.688 --> 01:28:36.232
...can be more real than this world.

1023
01:28:38.443 --> 01:28:40.945
All l do is pull the plug here.

1024
01:28:41.529 --> 01:28:42.530
But there...

1025
01:28:43.072 --> 01:28:45.366
<i>... you have to watch Apoc die.</i>

1026
01:28:53.124 --> 01:28:54.834
<i>Welcome to the real world.</i>

1027
01:28:55.168 --> 01:28:56.168
But you're out.

1028
01:28:56.336 --> 01:28:58.713
<i>- You can't go back.</i>
- That's what you think.

1029
01:28:59.005 --> 01:29:00.507
<i>They'll reinsert my body.</i>

1030
01:29:00.757 --> 01:29:04.385
<i>I go back to sleep. When I wake up,
I won't remember a thing.</i>

1031
01:29:04.636 --> 01:29:05.637
By the way...

1032
01:29:05.887 --> 01:29:08.848
...if you have anything important
to say to Switch...

1033
01:29:09.349 --> 01:29:10.433
<i>...say it now.</i>

1034
01:29:10.683 --> 01:29:11.683
No, please don't.

1035
01:29:12.101 --> 01:29:13.728
Not like this.

1036
01:29:15.438 --> 01:29:17.065
Not like this.

1037
01:29:21.528 --> 01:29:22.570
Too late.

1038
01:29:22.946 --> 01:29:24.614
Goddamn you, Cypher!

1039
01:29:24.864 --> 01:29:26.741
Don't hate me, Trinity.

1040
01:29:27.116 --> 01:29:28.993
l'm just a messenger.

1041
01:29:29.410 --> 01:29:32.580
And right now,
l'm going to prove it to you.

1042
01:29:33.665 --> 01:29:35.333
lf Morpheus was right...

1043
01:29:35.875 --> 01:29:37.752
...there's no way
l can pull this plug.

1044
01:29:38.336 --> 01:29:39.838
<i>If Neo 's the One...</i>

1045
01:29:40.338 --> 01:29:42.173
<i>... then there'd have to be...</i>

1046
01:29:42.423 --> 01:29:44.968
...some kind of a miracle to stop me.

1047
01:29:45.510 --> 01:29:46.510
Right?

1048
01:29:47.011 --> 01:29:49.180
l mean, how can he be the One...

1049
01:29:49.472 --> 01:29:50.472
...if he's dead?

1050
01:29:51.724 --> 01:29:53.977
<i>You never did answer me before...</i>

1051
01:29:54.269 --> 01:29:56.604
<i>...if you bought into
Morpheus ' bullshit.</i>

1052
01:29:56.980 --> 01:30:00.191
Come on. All l want
is a little yes or no.

1053
01:30:01.568 --> 01:30:03.903
Look into his eyes...

1054
01:30:04.654 --> 01:30:06.156
<i>... those big, pretty eyes...</i>

1055
01:30:08.908 --> 01:30:10.243
...and tell me...

1056
01:30:10.952 --> 01:30:12.203
<i>... yes...</i>

1057
01:30:12.537 --> 01:30:13.913
<i>...or no.</i>

1058
01:30:15.206 --> 01:30:16.291
Yes.

1059
01:30:17.167 --> 01:30:18.167
l don't believe it.

1060
01:30:19.502 --> 01:30:24.257
Believe it or not, you piece of shit,
you're still going to burn!

1061
01:30:42.942 --> 01:30:43.942
You first.

1062
01:30:52.118 --> 01:30:53.118
You're hurt.

1063
01:30:53.328 --> 01:30:54.412
l'll be all right.

1064
01:30:57.207 --> 01:30:58.374
Dozer?

1065
01:31:16.643 --> 01:31:19.020
Have you ever stood and stared at it?

1066
01:31:19.896 --> 01:31:23.024
Marveled at its beauty...

1067
01:31:23.399 --> 01:31:25.652
...its genius?

1068
01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:28.696
Billions of people...

1069
01:31:28.947 --> 01:31:31.699
...just living out their lives.

1070
01:31:32.742 --> 01:31:34.410
Oblivious.

1071
01:31:38.998 --> 01:31:41.876
Did you know that the first Matrix...

1072
01:31:42.126 --> 01:31:46.840
...was designed to be a perfect
human world where none suffered...

1073
01:31:47.298 --> 01:31:50.218
...where everyone would be happy.

1074
01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:52.262
lt was a disaster.

1075
01:31:52.512 --> 01:31:56.850
No one would accept the program.
Entire crops were lost.

1076
01:31:57.725 --> 01:31:59.477
Some believe that...

1077
01:31:59.727 --> 01:32:04.107
...we lacked the programming language
to describe your perfect world.

1078
01:32:04.357 --> 01:32:05.900
But l believe that...

1079
01:32:06.317 --> 01:32:07.317
...as a species...

1080
01:32:07.485 --> 01:32:11.322
...human beings define
their reality through misery...

1081
01:32:11.573 --> 01:32:12.949
...and suffering.

1082
01:32:13.199 --> 01:32:15.910
So the perfect world was a dream...

1083
01:32:16.161 --> 01:32:20.999
...that your primitive cerebrum
kept trying to wake up from.

1084
01:32:22.333 --> 01:32:26.004
Which is why the Matrix was
redesigned to this.

1085
01:32:26.462 --> 01:32:27.964
The peak...

1086
01:32:28.214 --> 01:32:29.632
...of your civilization.

1087
01:32:29.883 --> 01:32:32.135
l say, ''your civilization''...

1088
01:32:32.385 --> 01:32:36.514
...because when we started thinking
for you, it became our civilization...

1089
01:32:36.764 --> 01:32:39.851
...which is, of course,
what this is all about.

1090
01:32:41.186 --> 01:32:43.730
Evolution, Morpheus.

1091
01:32:44.063 --> 01:32:45.398
Evolution.

1092
01:32:47.692 --> 01:32:49.569
Like the dinosaur.

1093
01:32:51.738 --> 01:32:53.364
Look out that window.

1094
01:32:54.073 --> 01:32:56.201
You had your time.

1095
01:32:56.910 --> 01:33:00.830
The future is our world, Morpheus.

1096
01:33:01.164 --> 01:33:03.541
The future is our time.

1097
01:33:07.795 --> 01:33:08.880
There could be a problem.

1098
01:33:09.881 --> 01:33:13.259
- What are they doing to him?
- They're breaking into his mind.

1099
01:33:13.510 --> 01:33:15.678
lt's like hacking a computer.
All it takes is time.

1100
01:33:15.929 --> 01:33:17.138
How much time?

1101
01:33:17.388 --> 01:33:20.517
Depends on the mind.
But eventually, it'll crack...

1102
01:33:20.767 --> 01:33:25.188
...and his alpha patterns
will change from this to this.

1103
01:33:25.438 --> 01:33:28.399
When it does, he'll tell them
anything they want to know.

1104
01:33:28.650 --> 01:33:29.651
What do they want?

1105
01:33:29.943 --> 01:33:33.988
The leader of every ship is given codes
to Zion's mainframe computer.

1106
01:33:34.239 --> 01:33:37.158
lf an agent got the codes
and got into Zion's mainframe...

1107
01:33:37.408 --> 01:33:40.495
...they could destroy us.
We can't let that happen.

1108
01:33:41.329 --> 01:33:42.914
Zion's more important than me...

1109
01:33:43.164 --> 01:33:44.164
...or you...

1110
01:33:44.415 --> 01:33:45.667
...or even Morpheus.

1111
01:33:49.504 --> 01:33:51.172
There has to be
something we can do.

1112
01:33:51.589 --> 01:33:53.591
There is. We pull the plug.

1113
01:33:56.678 --> 01:33:58.429
You're going to kill him?

1114
01:33:58.680 --> 01:33:59.848
Kill Morpheus?

1115
01:34:00.473 --> 01:34:02.100
We don't have a choice.

1116
01:34:08.898 --> 01:34:11.818
Never send a human
to do a machine's job.

1117
01:34:12.068 --> 01:34:13.820
lf the insider has failed...

1118
01:34:14.070 --> 01:34:17.282
...they'll sever the connection
as soon as possible, unless...

1119
01:34:17.532 --> 01:34:19.242
They're dead. ln either case...

1120
01:34:19.492 --> 01:34:23.037
We have no choice. Continue as planned.
Deploy the sentinels.

1121
01:34:23.288 --> 01:34:24.372
lmmediately.

1122
01:34:29.627 --> 01:34:32.297
Morpheus, you were more
than a leader to us.

1123
01:34:33.256 --> 01:34:35.466
You were a father.

1124
01:34:37.010 --> 01:34:38.970
We'll miss you always.

1125
01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:47.061
Stop!

1126
01:34:48.271 --> 01:34:49.481
l don't believe this is happening.

1127
01:34:49.731 --> 01:34:51.774
- Neo, this has to be done.
- Does it?

1128
01:34:52.567 --> 01:34:53.943
l don't know.

1129
01:34:54.277 --> 01:34:55.820
This can't be just coincidence.

1130
01:34:56.029 --> 01:34:57.029
What?

1131
01:34:57.363 --> 01:34:58.363
The Oracle.

1132
01:34:58.448 --> 01:35:00.241
She told me this would happen.

1133
01:35:00.658 --> 01:35:04.829
She told me that l would
have to make a choice.

1134
01:35:05.288 --> 01:35:06.539
What choice?

1135
01:35:09.501 --> 01:35:10.501
What are you doing?

1136
01:35:10.793 --> 01:35:12.003
l'm going in.

1137
01:35:12.337 --> 01:35:13.588
No, you're not.

1138
01:35:13.838 --> 01:35:14.838
l have to.

1139
01:35:14.881 --> 01:35:18.510
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself
so that we could get you out.

1140
01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:20.678
There is no way
that you're going back in.

1141
01:35:21.262 --> 01:35:24.516
Morpheus did what he did because
he believed l'm something l'm not.

1142
01:35:27.769 --> 01:35:29.395
l'm not the One, Trinity.

1143
01:35:29.771 --> 01:35:32.732
- The Oracle hit me with that too.
- No, you have to be.

1144
01:35:32.982 --> 01:35:35.652
l'm sorry, l'm not.
l'm just another guy.

1145
01:35:36.319 --> 01:35:37.570
No, Neo, that's not true.

1146
01:35:38.154 --> 01:35:39.489
lt can't be true.

1147
01:35:39.823 --> 01:35:40.823
Why?

1148
01:35:45.203 --> 01:35:48.540
This is loco. They've got Morpheus
in a military-controlled building.

1149
01:35:48.790 --> 01:35:53.169
Even if you somehow got inside, those
are agents holding him. Three of them.

1150
01:35:54.462 --> 01:35:58.383
l want Morpheus back too, but
what you're talking about is suicide.

1151
01:35:58.633 --> 01:36:00.260
That's what it looks like...

1152
01:36:00.510 --> 01:36:01.510
...but it's not.

1153
01:36:01.678 --> 01:36:04.055
l can't explain to you why it's not.

1154
01:36:05.139 --> 01:36:08.810
Morpheus believed something, and
he was ready to give his life for it.

1155
01:36:09.102 --> 01:36:12.105
l understand that now.
That's why l have to go.

1156
01:36:12.355 --> 01:36:13.355
Why?

1157
01:36:13.439 --> 01:36:14.899
Because l believe in something.

1158
01:36:15.108 --> 01:36:16.108
What?

1159
01:36:17.402 --> 01:36:19.112
l believe l can bring him back.

1160
01:36:36.087 --> 01:36:38.006
- What are you doing?
- Going with you.

1161
01:36:38.298 --> 01:36:39.298
No, you're not.

1162
01:36:39.424 --> 01:36:40.424
''No''?

1163
01:36:41.467 --> 01:36:43.595
Let me tell you what l believe.

1164
01:36:44.095 --> 01:36:46.472
Morpheus means more to me
than he does to you.

1165
01:36:46.806 --> 01:36:51.102
l believe if you are serious about
saving him, you will need my help.

1166
01:36:51.352 --> 01:36:53.396
And since l am the ranking officer...

1167
01:36:53.646 --> 01:36:56.524
...if you don't like it,
l believe you can go to hell.

1168
01:36:57.275 --> 01:36:59.694
Because you aren't going anywhere else.

1169
01:37:00.111 --> 01:37:01.111
Tank...

1170
01:37:01.821 --> 01:37:02.989
...load us up.

1171
01:37:12.582 --> 01:37:15.877
l'd like to share
a revelation that l've had...

1172
01:37:16.294 --> 01:37:17.837
...during my time here.

1173
01:37:18.087 --> 01:37:22.091
lt came to me when l tried
to classify your species...

1174
01:37:22.342 --> 01:37:24.594
...and l realized...

1175
01:37:24.844 --> 01:37:27.138
...that you're not actually mammals.

1176
01:37:29.349 --> 01:37:31.810
Every mammal on this planet...

1177
01:37:32.143 --> 01:37:37.065
...instinctively develops an equilibrium
with the surrounding environment.

1178
01:37:37.315 --> 01:37:39.150
But you humans do not.

1179
01:37:39.692 --> 01:37:43.238
You move to an area
and you multiply...

1180
01:37:43.488 --> 01:37:47.992
...and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed.

1181
01:37:48.326 --> 01:37:50.411
The only way you can survive...

1182
01:37:50.703 --> 01:37:53.665
...is to spread to another area.

1183
01:37:59.087 --> 01:38:01.965
There is another organism
on this planet...

1184
01:38:02.215 --> 01:38:04.175
...that follows the same pattern.

1185
01:38:04.801 --> 01:38:06.469
Do you know what it is?

1186
01:38:06.845 --> 01:38:08.680
A virus.

1187
01:38:10.014 --> 01:38:13.059
Human beings are a disease.

1188
01:38:13.434 --> 01:38:14.978
A cancer of this planet.

1189
01:38:15.228 --> 01:38:17.355
You are a plague.

1190
01:38:17.897 --> 01:38:18.898
And we...

1191
01:38:19.482 --> 01:38:20.859
...are the cure.

1192
01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:23.278
Okay, so what do you need?

1193
01:38:23.903 --> 01:38:25.029
Besides a miracle.

1194
01:38:25.613 --> 01:38:26.781
Guns.

1195
01:38:27.866 --> 01:38:28.867
Lots of guns.

1196
01:38:41.713 --> 01:38:44.257
No one has ever done
anything like this.

1197
01:38:45.466 --> 01:38:47.385
That's why it's going to work.

1198
01:38:51.472 --> 01:38:53.433
Why isn't the serum working?

1199
01:38:54.017 --> 01:38:56.311
Perhaps we're asking
the wrong questions.

1200
01:38:58.396 --> 01:38:59.647
Leave me with him.

1201
01:39:02.233 --> 01:39:03.318
Now.

1202
01:39:14.579 --> 01:39:16.164
Hold on, Morpheus.

1203
01:39:16.414 --> 01:39:19.125
They're coming for you.
They're coming.

1204
01:39:21.503 --> 01:39:23.630
Can you hear me, Morpheus?

1205
01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:26.549
l'm going to be honest...

1206
01:39:26.925 --> 01:39:28.092
...with you.

1207
01:39:32.514 --> 01:39:33.932
l...

1208
01:39:35.016 --> 01:39:36.016
...hate...

1209
01:39:36.184 --> 01:39:38.144
...this place...

1210
01:39:38.478 --> 01:39:40.772
...this zoo...

1211
01:39:41.022 --> 01:39:42.106
...this prison...

1212
01:39:42.398 --> 01:39:45.568
...this reality,
whatever you want to call it.

1213
01:39:45.819 --> 01:39:48.112
l can't stand it any longer.

1214
01:39:48.863 --> 01:39:50.740
lt's the smell.

1215
01:39:52.116 --> 01:39:53.993
lf there is such a thing.

1216
01:39:54.327 --> 01:39:57.622
l feel saturated by it.

1217
01:39:59.123 --> 01:40:00.375
l can...

1218
01:40:00.667 --> 01:40:01.667
...taste...

1219
01:40:02.377 --> 01:40:04.420
...your stink.

1220
01:40:04.671 --> 01:40:08.424
And every time l do, l fear that
l have somehow been infected by it.

1221
01:40:08.675 --> 01:40:09.675
lt's repulsive.

1222
01:40:10.468 --> 01:40:11.845
lsn't it?

1223
01:40:14.013 --> 01:40:16.307
l must get out of here.

1224
01:40:16.724 --> 01:40:18.935
l must get free.

1225
01:40:19.185 --> 01:40:22.063
And in this mind is the key.

1226
01:40:22.313 --> 01:40:23.982
My key.

1227
01:40:24.232 --> 01:40:27.110
Once Zion is destroyed,
there is no need for me to be here.

1228
01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:28.987
Do you understand?

1229
01:40:29.279 --> 01:40:30.655
l need the codes.

1230
01:40:30.905 --> 01:40:33.241
l have to get inside Zion...

1231
01:40:33.575 --> 01:40:36.077
...and you have to tell me how.

1232
01:40:36.494 --> 01:40:38.371
You're going to tell me...

1233
01:40:38.621 --> 01:40:40.790
...or you're going to die.

1234
01:41:01.234 --> 01:41:04.920
Please remove any metallic items
you're carrying. Keys, loose change.

1235
01:41:08.077 --> 01:41:09.078
Holy shit!

1236
01:41:21.173 --> 01:41:22.173
Backup.

1237
01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:23.884
Send backup.

1238
01:41:47.908 --> 01:41:48.908
Freeze!

1239
01:44:03.878 --> 01:44:04.879
What were you doing?

1240
01:44:06.714 --> 01:44:07.965
He doesn't know.

1241
01:44:08.257 --> 01:44:09.759
Know what?

1242
01:44:37.828 --> 01:44:40.289
l think they're trying to save him.

1243
01:44:55.179 --> 01:44:56.889
There is no spoon.

1244
01:45:26.544 --> 01:45:28.671
Find them and destroy them!

1245
01:45:30.472 --> 01:45:32.372
I repeat, we're under attack!

1246
01:46:06.159 --> 01:46:07.159
Help!

1247
01:46:29.015 --> 01:46:30.225
Only human.

1248
01:46:31.309 --> 01:46:32.309
Dodge this.

1249
01:46:45.490 --> 01:46:47.033
- How did you do that?
- Do what?

1250
01:46:47.409 --> 01:46:51.329
You moved like they do.
l've never seen anyone move that fast.

1251
01:46:52.455 --> 01:46:53.832
lt wasn't fast enough.

1252
01:46:56.585 --> 01:46:57.878
Can you fly that thing?

1253
01:46:59.212 --> 01:47:00.212
Not yet.

1254
01:47:03.508 --> 01:47:04.508
Operator.

1255
01:47:04.551 --> 01:47:07.721
<i>I need a pilot program
for a B-212 helicopter.</i>

1256
01:47:08.180 --> 01:47:09.473
<i>Hurry.</i>

1257
01:47:17.397 --> 01:47:19.024
Let's go.

1258
01:47:34.122 --> 01:47:35.207
No.

1259
01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:28.343
Morpheus, get up.

1260
01:48:28.593 --> 01:48:29.593
Get up, get up.

1261
01:49:07.465 --> 01:49:08.508
He's not going to make it.

1262
01:49:18.310 --> 01:49:19.352
Got you.

1263
01:51:08.262 --> 01:51:09.681
l knew it.

1264
01:51:10.515 --> 01:51:11.516
He's the One.

1265
01:51:27.532 --> 01:51:29.701
Do you believe it now, Trinity?

1266
01:51:35.623 --> 01:51:36.623
The Oracle.

1267
01:51:37.792 --> 01:51:40.128
- She told me...
- She told you...

1268
01:51:40.545 --> 01:51:42.088
...what you needed to hear.

1269
01:51:42.380 --> 01:51:43.715
That's all.

1270
01:51:44.799 --> 01:51:47.719
Sooner or later you'll realize,
just as l did...

1271
01:51:48.052 --> 01:51:50.346
...there's a difference
between knowing the path...

1272
01:51:51.139 --> 01:51:52.390
...and walking the path.

1273
01:51:55.476 --> 01:51:56.644
Operator.

1274
01:51:57.562 --> 01:52:00.106
- lt's good to hear your voice.
<i>- We need an exit.</i>

1275
01:52:00.398 --> 01:52:03.151
Got one ready. Subway station,
State and Balboa.

1276
01:52:16.247 --> 01:52:17.247
Damn it!

1277
01:52:17.415 --> 01:52:18.625
The trace was completed.

1278
01:52:18.916 --> 01:52:19.916
We have their position.

1279
01:52:20.251 --> 01:52:22.462
Sentinels are standing by.

1280
01:52:24.172 --> 01:52:25.673
Order the strike.

1281
01:52:32.263 --> 01:52:33.348
They're not out yet.

1282
01:52:45.443 --> 01:52:46.736
You first, Morpheus.

1283
01:53:07.465 --> 01:53:09.717
Neo, l want to tell you something...

1284
01:53:12.971 --> 01:53:16.933
...but l'm afraid of
what it could mean if l do.

1285
01:53:20.561 --> 01:53:23.815
Everything the Oracle
told me has come true.

1286
01:53:26.567 --> 01:53:28.111
Everything but this.

1287
01:53:29.821 --> 01:53:30.821
But what?

1288
01:53:57.015 --> 01:53:58.599
- What happened?
- An agent.

1289
01:53:58.850 --> 01:53:59.850
Send me back.

1290
01:53:59.934 --> 01:54:00.934
l can't.

1291
01:54:02.854 --> 01:54:04.814
Mr. Anderson.

1292
01:54:07.025 --> 01:54:08.359
Run, Neo. Run.

1293
01:54:13.698 --> 01:54:15.283
What is he doing?

1294
01:54:15.533 --> 01:54:16.784
He's beginning to believe.

1295
01:54:43.778 --> 01:54:45.029
You're empty.

1296
01:54:45.622 --> 01:54:46.915
So are you.

1297
01:55:20.174 --> 01:55:23.177
l'm going to enjoy watching you die...

1298
01:55:24.303 --> 01:55:25.345
...Mr. Anderson.

1299
01:56:06.303 --> 01:56:08.388
Jesus, he's killing him.

1300
01:57:34.558 --> 01:57:36.685
You hear that, Mr. Anderson?

1301
01:57:37.436 --> 01:57:40.439
That is the sound of inevitability.

1302
01:57:43.025 --> 01:57:46.361
lt is the sound of your death.

1303
01:57:47.279 --> 01:57:49.615
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1304
01:57:49.865 --> 01:57:51.492
My name...

1305
01:57:54.495 --> 01:57:56.538
...is Neo.

1306
01:58:28.779 --> 01:58:30.906
- What happened?
- l don't know. l lost him.

1307
01:58:33.492 --> 01:58:34.535
Oh, shit.

1308
01:58:46.922 --> 01:58:48.382
Sentinels.

1309
01:58:49.132 --> 01:58:51.385
- How long?
- Five, maybe six minutes.

1310
01:58:53.428 --> 01:58:55.597
Tank, charge the EMP.

1311
01:58:55.848 --> 01:58:58.892
- We can't use that until he's out.
- l know. Don't worry.

1312
01:59:00.269 --> 01:59:01.269
He's gonna make it.

1313
01:59:01.395 --> 01:59:03.272
Flat or pumps? No, just...

1314
01:59:03.522 --> 01:59:06.400
What the shit? That's my phone!

1315
01:59:06.817 --> 01:59:08.402
That guy took my phone!

1316
01:59:10.779 --> 01:59:11.779
Got him!

1317
01:59:11.864 --> 01:59:13.073
He's on the run.

1318
01:59:13.323 --> 01:59:14.323
<i>Mr. Wizard...</i>

1319
01:59:14.616 --> 01:59:15.993
...get me out of here!

1320
01:59:16.243 --> 01:59:18.120
<i>I got an old exit.
Wabash and Lake.</i>

1321
01:59:22.166 --> 01:59:23.166
Oh, shit!

1322
01:59:44.646 --> 01:59:46.648
Help! Need a little help!

1323
01:59:48.275 --> 01:59:49.485
<i>The door.</i>

1324
02:00:05.459 --> 02:00:06.960
<i>The door on your left.</i>

1325
02:00:07.878 --> 02:00:09.129
<i>Your other left!</i>

1326
02:00:15.844 --> 02:00:17.095
<i>The back door.</i>

1327
02:00:37.866 --> 02:00:38.992
Oh, no.

1328
02:00:40.661 --> 02:00:42.162
Here they come.

1329
02:01:10.941 --> 02:01:12.192
He's going to make it.

1330
02:01:22.411 --> 02:01:25.539
<i>The fire escape at the end
of the alley, room 303.</i>

1331
02:02:00.866 --> 02:02:01.866
They're inside.

1332
02:02:04.286 --> 02:02:05.286
Hurry, Neo.

1333
02:03:01.468 --> 02:03:02.469
lt can't be.

1334
02:03:10.269 --> 02:03:11.645
Check him.

1335
02:03:15.649 --> 02:03:17.192
He's gone.

1336
02:03:23.907 --> 02:03:26.326
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1337
02:03:36.420 --> 02:03:38.380
l'm not afraid anymore.

1338
02:03:40.007 --> 02:03:41.258
The Oracle told me...

1339
02:03:43.427 --> 02:03:46.930
...l'd fall in love, and that
the man l loved would be the One.

1340
02:03:50.058 --> 02:03:52.019
So you see...

1341
02:03:52.728 --> 02:03:54.730
...you can't be dead.

1342
02:03:56.315 --> 02:03:58.150
You can't be...

1343
02:03:59.693 --> 02:04:01.862
...because l love you.

1344
02:04:03.697 --> 02:04:05.407
You hear me?

1345
02:04:06.533 --> 02:04:08.202
l love you.

1346
02:04:32.142 --> 02:04:33.227
Now, get up.

1347
02:04:42.236 --> 02:04:43.236
No.

1348
02:05:10.013 --> 02:05:11.013
How?

1349
02:05:11.723 --> 02:05:12.766
He is the One.

1350
02:07:37.244 --> 02:07:38.954
<i>I know you're out there.</i>

1351
02:07:39.204 --> 02:07:41.039
<i>I can feel you now.</i>

1352
02:07:41.456 --> 02:07:43.250
<i>I know that you're afraid.</i>

1353
02:07:43.500 --> 02:07:45.085
<i>You're afraid of us.</i>

1354
02:07:45.419 --> 02:07:47.254
<i>You're afraid of change.</i>

1355
02:07:47.504 --> 02:07:49.965
<i>I don't know the future.</i>

1356
02:07:50.215 --> 02:07:52.801
<i>I didn't come here to tell you
how this is going to end.</i>

1357
02:07:53.051 --> 02:07:56.013
<i>I came here to tell you
how it's going to begin.</i>

1358
02:07:56.972 --> 02:07:58.557
<i>I'll hang up this phone.</i>

1359
02:07:58.807 --> 02:08:01.894
<i>And then I'll show these people
what you don't want them to see.</i>

1360
02:08:02.144 --> 02:08:04.021
<i>I'm going to show them a world...</i>

1361
02:08:04.271 --> 02:08:06.023
<i>... without you.</i>

1362
02:08:06.315 --> 02:08:09.943
<i>A world without rules and controls,
without borders or boundaries.</i>

1363
02:08:10.194 --> 02:08:13.906
<i>A world where anything is possible.</i>

1364
02:08:16.533 --> 02:08:17.868
<i>Where we go from there...</i>

1365
02:08:18.118 --> 02:08:20.078
<i>...is a choice I leave to you.</i>

1366
