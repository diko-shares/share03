Ladies and gentlemen, l would
now like to introduce

2
00:03:19,635 --> 00:03:21,728
a legend in our industry.

3
00:03:22,204 --> 00:03:25,605
She`s the most successful president
in the history of our network

4
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:30,107
and for the past five years has
kept us at the very top of the ratings.

5
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:32,906
She`s our maverick, our wild card,

6
00:03:33,115 --> 00:03:36,175
and today she`s gonna take us
right to the edge.

7
00:03:36,385 --> 00:03:38,751
Please welcome a giant, a genius

8
00:03:38,954 --> 00:03:45,553
and the hardest-working person
in television: Joanna Eberhart.

9
00:03:46,628 --> 00:03:48,721
Way to go, Joanna!

10
00:03:55,504 --> 00:03:59,736
Thank you all so much. Thank you.

11
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,434
Joanna!

12
00:04:02,644 --> 00:04:07,308
That feels good, especially coming
from such a fantastic group of people

13
00:04:07,516 --> 00:04:10,713
from all across our great nation,
our network affiliates.

14
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:15,356
Give yourselves a great big hand.
You deserve it.

15
00:04:16,491 --> 00:04:19,483
And l want
a big, fat Christmas bonus.

16
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:22,288
Just kidding, but not really,
because...

17
00:04:22,531 --> 00:04:26,365
...l am so excited, l am so on fire,
l am so guts-and-glory passionate

18
00:04:26,602 --> 00:04:28,069
about what l am about to show you.

19
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,568
So get ready, because
on monday nights

20
00:04:30,772 --> 00:04:35,072
the whole world will be watching
a man, a woman and a buzzer!

21
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:46,452
Are you ready
for the final gender challenge?

22
00:04:49,124 --> 00:04:50,819
- Who makes more money?
- l do.

23
00:04:51,026 --> 00:04:53,893
Who enters lronman triathlons
every year and wins?

24
00:04:54,096 --> 00:04:55,120
l do.

25
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,026
Who secretly wishes they were
married to a hot, sexy lesbian?

26
00:04:58,533 --> 00:04:59,591
- l do!
- l do!

27
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:01,996
lt`s Tara!

28
00:05:08,944 --> 00:05:10,502
And...

29
00:05:11,413 --> 00:05:13,176
...on Thursdays...

30
00:05:13,382 --> 00:05:15,976
No, this is not just a TV show.

31
00:05:16,184 --> 00:05:19,312
No, this is a breakthrough,
a breakout, a break-all-the-rules

32
00:05:19,521 --> 00:05:21,785
and bring-on-the-Emmys
mega-smash!

33
00:05:22,658 --> 00:05:24,421
Yes!

34
00:05:24,626 --> 00:05:29,120
Can l present to you this planet`s
ultimate reality phenomenon?

35
00:05:29,398 --> 00:05:32,492
<i>I Can Do Better!</i>

36
00:05:44,613 --> 00:05:47,582
<i>We wiII aII be right there</i>

<i>And at the end of the week...</i>
<i>WeII</i>, <i>Iet`s take a peek.</i>

40
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:03,122
Well, it`s been a week, and <i>H</i>ank,
our personnel manager from <i>O</i>maha,

41
00:06:03,332 --> 00:06:05,857
has spent the entire seven days
with Vanessa,

42
00:06:06,068 --> 00:06:08,036
our call girl and exotic dancer.

43
00:06:08,303 --> 00:06:09,827
Yeah, it`s been amazing.

44
00:06:10,372 --> 00:06:14,365
And l`ll admit we`ve had some fun
in the hot tub and all.

45
00:06:14,609 --> 00:06:16,509
<i>B</i>ut you wanna know something,
<i>B</i>illy?

46
00:06:16,745 --> 00:06:18,645
All we did was talk...

47
00:06:18,914 --> 00:06:20,108
...because l love my wife...

48
00:06:20,682 --> 00:06:25,517
...and the only place l want to be
is back in <i>O</i>maha with my <i>B</i>arbara.

49
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:28,252
Tough break, Nessa.

50
00:06:28,457 --> 00:06:30,357
And <i>B</i>arbara, you spent monday
with <i>R</i>ocky,

51
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:32,789
our bodybuilder and male escort,

52
00:06:33,028 --> 00:06:35,622
Tuesday through Thursday
with the entire cast

53
00:06:35,831 --> 00:06:37,924
of the XXX film <i>Hung Jury</i>,

54
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:42,297
and you spent
the entire weekend with Tonkiro.

55
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:52,610
And now it`s time for the final
decision. <i>B</i>arbara, it`s yours to make.

56
00:06:52,814 --> 00:06:55,374
ls it gonna be <i>O</i>maha?

57
00:06:57,486 --> 00:06:59,113
<i>O</i>r ``<i>O</i>ma-hunks``?

58
00:06:59,321 --> 00:07:01,289
Well...

59
00:07:02,124 --> 00:07:05,321
...before l came on this show
l only had sex with one man,

60
00:07:05,527 --> 00:07:07,051
and that was usually <i>H</i>ank.

61
00:07:07,863 --> 00:07:11,424
l love <i>H</i>ank deeply and forever
with all my heart,

62
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:14,329
and l would never do anything
to hurt him.

63
00:07:15,637 --> 00:07:17,264
<i>B</i>ut l can do better!

64
00:07:25,046 --> 00:07:28,948
The battle of the sexes,
as old as time but as--

65
00:07:29,151 --> 00:07:31,016
Why?

66
00:07:32,521 --> 00:07:35,888
- Excuse me?
- Why did you do it?

67
00:07:36,091 --> 00:07:39,083
<i>O</i>h, my God, it`s <i>H</i>ank
from <i>I Can Do Better!</i>

68
00:07:39,294 --> 00:07:41,387
<i>H</i>ank, everyone.

69
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:48,594
No, stop it.

70
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,335
l love <i>B</i>arbara. l had a family.
l had a life.

71
00:07:53,141 --> 00:07:54,233
<i>H</i>ank,

72
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:56,409
l know it hurts.

73
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:58,374
Love isn`t easy.

74
00:07:58,647 --> 00:08:02,913
<i>R</i>elationships aren`t easy,
not for anyone.

75
00:08:03,185 --> 00:08:06,586
<i>B</i>ut now you know the truth
about <i>B</i>arbara,

76
00:08:06,788 --> 00:08:09,586
and you are gonna move on
with your life.

77
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,725
And you`re gonna meet
someone wonderful,

78
00:08:11,927 --> 00:08:15,328
and America is gonna love you.

79
00:08:23,638 --> 00:08:27,506
Yeah. l`ve got a great idea
for another hot new show.

80
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:29,074
Well, tell it to us.

81
00:08:29,277 --> 00:08:30,744
lt`s called...

82
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:33,412
- ...<i>Let`s KiII AII the Women.</i>
- <i>H</i>e`s got a gun!

83
00:08:43,325 --> 00:08:46,692
- Joanna, are you all right?
- l am great.

84
00:08:46,895 --> 00:08:50,661
<i>R</i>aring to go. The police were
sensational. And not a scratch.

85
00:08:50,866 --> 00:08:54,302
- You haven`t heard?
- About what?

86
00:08:57,506 --> 00:09:01,237
That man, <i>H</i>ank.
<i>R</i>ight before he tried to kill you,

87
00:09:01,443 --> 00:09:04,970
he went to see his ex-wife
and five of her new boyfriends.

88
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,648
- <i>H</i>e did?
- <i>H</i>e shot all of them.

89
00:09:07,849 --> 00:09:09,282
The wife is in critical condition,

90
00:09:09,484 --> 00:09:11,349
and four of the guys
are on life support.

91
00:09:11,553 --> 00:09:13,043
- Tonkiro?
- <i>H</i>e`s fine.

92
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:16,281
- Thank God.
- So you know what this means.

93
00:09:17,826 --> 00:09:19,054
<i>O</i>f course.

94
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:21,821
We pay for all of their medical
treatment, every penny.

95
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,999
We get them the very best therapist,
childcare, rehab,

96
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,795
whatever they need, and then
we fly them to New York, first class,

97
00:09:29,004 --> 00:09:30,130
for a prime-time special,

98
00:09:30,338 --> 00:09:33,364
<i>Hank and Barbara:</i>
<i>Let the HeaIing Begin.</i>

99
00:09:33,808 --> 00:09:35,503
You`re not listening.

100
00:09:35,777 --> 00:09:39,178
We can`t wear this. The lawsuits
alone may bankrupt the network.

101
00:09:39,381 --> 00:09:42,748
And all your new shows, the whole
lineup, the affiliates won`t touch them.

102
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,784
We have shareholders.

103
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:48,785
We can`t let you sink the network.

104
00:09:51,226 --> 00:09:53,820
<i>B</i>ut we wish you only the best.

105
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,525
<i>O</i>f course.

106
00:10:29,698 --> 00:10:34,533
Thank you for being so classy
and taking this so well.

107
00:11:00,228 --> 00:11:04,426
Joanna, we just wanted to say
that this is so not fair.

108
00:11:09,671 --> 00:11:11,935
Goodbye, everybody!

109
00:11:12,507 --> 00:11:14,441
All the best!

110
00:11:43,538 --> 00:11:45,005
Jo?

111
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:49,203
Walter.

112
00:11:50,011 --> 00:11:53,572
- What happened?
- Well,

113
00:11:53,815 --> 00:11:56,875
you`ve had a complete
nervous collapse.

114
00:11:57,318 --> 00:11:59,081
And the doctors say there`s a lot
of work to do,

115
00:11:59,287 --> 00:12:01,551
but you`re gonna be just fine.

116
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:05,749
<i>O</i>h, and Pete made this for you.

117
00:12:07,195 --> 00:12:10,062
- <i>O</i>h, that`s so sweet.
- lsn`t it?

118
00:12:10,265 --> 00:12:13,462
And l wanted you to know
that the minute l heard the news,

119
00:12:13,668 --> 00:12:16,603
l called the network and l quit.

120
00:12:16,838 --> 00:12:20,274
- You did that for me?
- <i>O</i>f course.

121
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:23,306
l know l was only a vice president,

122
00:12:23,511 --> 00:12:26,207
but l could never work
for those people,

123
00:12:26,414 --> 00:12:29,542
not after the way they treated you.

124
00:12:29,918 --> 00:12:32,011
<i>O</i>h, Walter...

125
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,517
And do you remember what today is?

126
00:12:35,824 --> 00:12:37,883
lt`s our anniversary.

127
00:12:39,127 --> 00:12:42,961
<i>O</i>h, Walter...

128
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:47,393
...l`m so sorry.

129
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:51,170
maybe that man who tried
to shoot me, maybe he was right.

130
00:12:51,372 --> 00:12:53,431
maybe l`ve become the wrong kind
of woman.

131
00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:57,042
maybe l`ve made all
of the wrong decisions.

132
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:02,113
Could we get away and start over?

133
00:13:02,317 --> 00:13:06,014
And get it right, our marriage?

134
00:13:12,894 --> 00:13:15,260
- <i>B</i>ut why are we moving?
- To Connecticut?

135
00:13:15,597 --> 00:13:18,691
We`re moving so that we can all
kick back and have a great new life

136
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,698
in this beautiful new town.

137
00:13:38,219 --> 00:13:40,551

l`m with Stepford <i>R</i>ealty.
We spoke on the phone.

144
00:14:49,657 --> 00:14:51,921
- You must be Walter.
- So nice to meet you in person.

145
00:14:52,193 --> 00:14:53,717
And the little ones.

146
00:14:53,928 --> 00:14:55,190
l bet you`re Pete.

147
00:14:55,563 --> 00:14:57,053
- Duh.
- Pete.

148
00:14:57,565 --> 00:14:59,863
And he`s every bit as handsome
as his dad.

149
00:15:00,268 --> 00:15:01,565
Thank you.

150
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:04,966
And Kimberly, aren`t you just
the cutest little bug`s ear.

151
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:06,195
<i>B</i>ugs don`t have ears.

152
00:15:07,275 --> 00:15:10,733
lsn`t she sassy, and a little sad.

153
00:15:11,546 --> 00:15:14,174
And this must be Joanna.

154
00:15:14,449 --> 00:15:17,612
- Electroshock?
- <i>B</i>ut she`s doing great.

155
00:15:18,086 --> 00:15:20,418
<i>H</i>ello, little Energizer.

156
00:15:21,122 --> 00:15:26,150
The minute Walter called, l knew
this was the perfect house for you.

157
00:15:26,394 --> 00:15:29,363
lt`s the top of the line
here at Stepford Estates,

158
00:15:29,564 --> 00:15:32,897
and it`s got everything
an American family could ever need.

159
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:36,334
- And may l present to you...
- Look at this.

160
00:15:36,738 --> 00:15:39,263
- This is amazing.
- ...the great room.

l call it cozy.

162
00:15:42,844 --> 00:15:48,339
And it`s also a smart house. Now,
this controls the security system.

163
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:56,047
- <i>AII secure.</i>
- lt talks to the refrigerator.

164
00:15:56,291 --> 00:16:00,625
<i>We need juice</i>, <i>we need juice</i>,
<i>we need juice.</i>

165
00:16:00,828 --> 00:16:03,490
The system also monitors
all the commodes.

166
00:16:03,731 --> 00:16:07,167
Where it will test your urine
for blood sugar, protein and body fat.

167
00:16:07,702 --> 00:16:10,170
<i>FIush toiIets.</i>

168

170
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:18,872
Now, Walter,
will you be commuting?

00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,547
No.

172
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:25,381
No, Joanna and l both

The town is over 200 years old.

177
00:17:54,342 --> 00:17:58,073
lt was founded by George Washington,
and martha just loved it.

178
00:17:58,813 --> 00:18:01,043
Stepford is Connecticut`s
family paradise.

179
00:18:01,249 --> 00:18:04,412
lt has no crime, no poverty
and no pushing.

180
00:18:08,022 --> 00:18:10,616
What is that? Up on the hill?

181
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:13,657
Well, that`s
our Stepford men`s Association.

182
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:17,388
Where all our wonderful guys can get
together and stay out of our hair.

183
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,665
Am l right?

184
00:18:20,868 --> 00:18:24,668
- Where do the women go?
- To the Simply Stepford Day Spa.

185
00:18:36,884 --> 00:18:41,150

187
00:18:46,928 --> 00:18:50,056
Good morning, Joanna.

188
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:55,468
- Are we ready to work out?

Places and poles, please.

190
00:19:06,848 --> 00:19:09,749
Wait, you work out dressed like this?

191
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:15,787
Well, of course. Whatever we do,
we always want to look our very best.

192
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:19,824
l mean, why, imagine if our husbands
saw us

193
00:19:20,128 --> 00:19:22,187
in worn, dark, urban sweat clothes

194
00:19:22,396 --> 00:19:25,763
with stringy hair
and almost no makeup?

195
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:27,298
<i>O</i>h, good heavens.

196
00:19:27,502 --> 00:19:28,833
Now,

today you are in for a special treat

198
00:19:32,273 --> 00:19:34,400
because we are working on a series
of exercises

199
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:38,375
which l`ve personally invented,
based on simple household tasks.

200
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:40,840
l call my program Clairobics.

201
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:42,982
<i>B</i>ecause her name is Claire.

202
00:19:44,752 --> 00:19:48,085
All right, now it`s time to slim

203
00:19:48,356 --> 00:19:52,122
Let`s all be washing machines.
And...

204
00:19:57,198 --> 00:19:58,187
And...

205
00:20:02,003 --> 00:20:04,198

And...

209
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:13,810

222
00:21:27,581 --> 00:21:30,812
A real old-fashioned town picnic.
Can`t get this in manhattan.

223
00:21:31,017 --> 00:21:32,848
Which is why we`re gonna stay
exactly ten minutes.

224
00:21:33,053 --> 00:21:35,613
We`re gonna make an appearance,
and then we`re gonna get out of here.

225
00:21:35,822 --> 00:21:39,656
Kids, l`m really sorry about all of this,
but let`s try and have fun.

226
00:21:40,093 --> 00:21:41,526
mom, it`s a picnic.

227
00:21:41,862 --> 00:21:44,854
- Chill.
- Go ahead, go ahead, have fun.

228
00:21:45,165 --> 00:21:46,723
Ten minutes?

229
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,490
Walter, you just don`t get it.

230
00:21:48,702 --> 00:21:51,102
These women are like
deranged-flight-attendant friendly.

231
00:21:51,304 --> 00:21:54,637
- They`re gonna be all over me.

00:22:08,989 --> 00:22:11,822
They`re new, a little experiment.

00:22:12,025 --> 00:22:14,585
Now l know why they call it

Am l the only one who finds all of this
more than a little disturbing?

243
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,905
We are celebrating
our nation`s birthday,

244
00:22:32,112 --> 00:22:33,909
but there are almost no
African-Americans,

245

00:23:24,364 --> 00:23:26,924

That is not cobbler.

<i>R</i>oger, could we...? Could we reel it
in, like, a couple of hundred yards?

270

<i>H</i>ow do you ladies keep your figures?

271
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:42,009

00:26:59,979 --> 00:27:02,709
- What was that?
- <i>H</i>erb, Dave,

331
00:27:03,016 --> 00:27:05,610
give me a hand, and we`ll get
Sarah right into my <i>H</i>ummer.

332
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:07,878
- Your <i>H</i>ummer?
- lt`s a sweet ride.

333
00:27:08,088 --> 00:27:09,885
- lt`s roomy.
- <i>H</i>ere you go.

334
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:12,388
We need an ambulance.
You shouldn`t be moving her.

335
00:27:12,926 --> 00:27:15,759
She might need oxygen, paramedics.

336
00:27:15,962 --> 00:27:18,260
Everything isn`t always
about you, Jo.

337
00:27:18,465 --> 00:27:19,955
Walter.

338
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:24,830
She`ll be fine. lt`s too much sun.
She`s dehydrated.

339
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:28,940
- Dehydrated? Are you crazy?
- Jo. l`m sorry about this, mike.

340
00:27:29,476 --> 00:27:34,277
Joanna. Joanna, this is
a very special moment.

341
00:27:34,481 --> 00:27:36,847
- l would like you to meet...
- mike Wellington.

342
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,677
my husband.

343
00:27:38,885 --> 00:27:40,978
- <i>O</i>h...
- And you must be the famous Joanna.

344
00:27:41,187 --> 00:27:43,382
You`re even prettier
than in the newspapers.

345
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:46,150
- They don`t do you justice.
- Excuse me, that woman is very sick.

346
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:48,020
Thank you. l should be going
with her.

347
00:27:48,228 --> 00:27:51,197
She`ll get all the help she needs.
Trust me, little lady.

348
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:02,032
That woman had a seizure,
and she was practically levitating.

349
00:28:02,242 --> 00:28:05,643
And l have told you five million times
l phoned <i>H</i>erb.

350
00:28:05,879 --> 00:28:07,779
<i>H</i>e said that Sarah is fine.

351
00:28:07,981 --> 00:28:10,449
She just needed some fluids,
just like mike said.

352
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,983
- She was sparking, Walter.
- She was dancing.

353
00:28:14,187 --> 00:28:17,588
Then why wasn`t there
a doctor anywhere? And why...?

354
00:28:19,492 --> 00:28:20,925
Why...?

355
00:28:22,328 --> 00:28:24,922
Walter! Walter!
And why did everyone

356
00:28:25,131 --> 00:28:26,894
just automatically listen
to that mike person?

357
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,295
And why, why was everyone
just standing there?

358
00:28:29,502 --> 00:28:31,333
You mean why weren`t they
just listening to you?

359
00:28:31,704 --> 00:28:35,037
- That`s not what l`m saying!
- Jesus Christ, Joanna!

360
00:28:35,241 --> 00:28:37,175
- What?
- You were fired,

361
00:28:37,377 --> 00:28:40,505
your kids barely know you,
and our marriage is falling apart.

362
00:28:40,713 --> 00:28:43,477
And your whole attitude
makes people want to kill you.

363
00:28:43,683 --> 00:28:46,345
lt makes people try to kill you.

364
00:28:46,553 --> 00:28:47,918
That`s what we`re doing here.

365
00:28:48,121 --> 00:28:50,385
The people in this town
have been nothing

366
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:53,821
but friendly and welcoming
and wonderful to you.

367
00:28:54,127 --> 00:28:56,687
And you`ve been nothing but snide
and suspicious.

368
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,360
And on top of that, at the picnic
you humiliated me.

369
00:28:59,566 --> 00:29:00,760
Well, l can`t do it anymore.

370
00:29:00,967 --> 00:29:05,427
l can`t keep fighting you for every
inch of everything. Game over.

371
00:29:05,638 --> 00:29:08,664
- marriage over.
- <i>O</i>h, no!

372
00:29:09,275 --> 00:29:10,674
- No!
- No what?

373
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,671
Please don`t go.

374
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:15,177
- Why not?
- <i>B</i>ecause you`re right.

375
00:29:18,418 --> 00:29:21,819
Wait, l`m sorry. l don`t think
l heard that. What did you just say?

376
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:26,559
l said, you`re right.

377
00:29:27,193 --> 00:29:28,251
About?

378
00:29:28,928 --> 00:29:30,919
About everything.

379
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,264
About me.

380
00:30:02,428 --> 00:30:05,192
Do you know why l signed on
at the network?

381
00:30:06,699 --> 00:30:10,226
<i>B</i>ecause l thought that if l was
around, l could help you lighten up.

382
00:30:11,004 --> 00:30:12,767
You did?

383
00:30:13,206 --> 00:30:15,401
Yeah, l did. What was that
one show called?

384
00:30:15,675 --> 00:30:17,074
<i>I Can Do</i> E<i>verybod</i>Y?

385
00:30:17,911 --> 00:30:21,347
See, that`s what l mean.
l wanted to make you laugh.

386
00:30:23,249 --> 00:30:25,877
That`s so sweet, but l...

387
00:30:27,053 --> 00:30:32,457
l was busy. l was running
a network, Walter.

388
00:30:32,692 --> 00:30:35,160
You were so busy that we haven`t
made love in over a year.

389
00:30:35,361 --> 00:30:38,956
- l know. l...
- Well, l miss you.

390
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:44,398
<i>B</i>ut l`ve always loved you
so much. l...

391
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:47,403
You know that.

392
00:30:48,241 --> 00:30:49,868
Why?

393
00:30:51,144 --> 00:30:53,635
<i>B</i>ecause... <i>B</i>ecause...

394
00:30:54,781 --> 00:30:56,749
...you`re goofy, and you`re...

395
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,719
You`re handsome, and you`re...
You`re...

396
00:31:01,154 --> 00:31:03,622
You`re my Walter.

397
00:31:05,191 --> 00:31:07,557
And because when
you play computer chess

398
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,523
you do that little...

399
00:31:09,762 --> 00:31:13,664
- You do that little victory dance.
- l do not. l don`t do that.

400
00:31:13,866 --> 00:31:16,562
- Yes, you do.
- No, l don`t.

401
00:31:22,008 --> 00:31:25,000
<i>B</i>ut if l`m not the smartest

402
00:31:25,211 --> 00:31:27,372
and the best of the best
and the most successful,

403
00:31:27,613 --> 00:31:29,911
then l don`t know, who am l?

404
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:32,350
You wanna find out?

405
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,482
<i>H</i>ow?

406
00:31:37,323 --> 00:31:40,417
First of all, we`re in the country now,
so no more black.

407
00:31:40,626 --> 00:31:43,117
- No more black? Are you insane?
- You heard me.

408
00:31:43,329 --> 00:31:45,160
<i>O</i>nly high-powered, neurotic,
castrating,

409
00:31:45,365 --> 00:31:48,664
manhattan career bitches wear black.
ls that what you wanna be?

410
00:31:49,736 --> 00:31:52,364
Ever since l was a little girl.

411
00:31:56,409 --> 00:31:58,900
Do l really look <i>O</i>K?

412
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,077
Can l be honest?

413
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,877
- You look kind of like <i>B</i>etty Crocker.
- l know.

414
00:32:06,452 --> 00:32:08,682
- At <i>B</i>etty Ford.
- <i>We need miIk.</i>

415
00:32:08,888 --> 00:32:11,254
- <i>We need miIk. We need miIk.</i>
- Thank you.

416
00:32:11,491 --> 00:32:14,016
Look, l`m trying to make
an effort to change.

417
00:32:14,227 --> 00:32:16,195
l mean, last night my husband
was a different person.

418
00:32:16,396 --> 00:32:19,797
<i>H</i>e was strong, he was forceful,
he was commanding.

419
00:32:19,999 --> 00:32:21,489
Like your refrigerator.

420
00:32:21,768 --> 00:32:24,362
Well, nobody said it was gonna
be easy being a homemaker

421
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:26,094
and a stay-at-home mom.

422
00:32:26,572 --> 00:32:28,767
lt`s the toughest job
in the world, right?

423
00:32:28,975 --> 00:32:31,000
Well, that may be, but these
Stepford women,

424
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:33,576
- they`re a whole other dimension.
- <i>O</i>h, like yesterday,

425
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,214
that poor lady, Sarah Sunderson.

426
00:32:36,416 --> 00:32:37,940
Walter said she`s fine.

427
00:32:38,151 --> 00:32:40,176
<i>B</i>ut you said she was shooting off
sparks from her ears.

428
00:32:40,386 --> 00:32:41,876
- Now, that`s the first sign.
- <i>O</i>f what?

429
00:32:42,088 --> 00:32:43,817
Cheap jewelry.

430
00:32:44,457 --> 00:32:47,085
- We should go see her.
- Why?

431
00:32:47,293 --> 00:32:49,386
<i>B</i>ecause we need to be supportive.

432
00:32:49,595 --> 00:32:51,586
That`s how people behave outside
of manhattan.

433
00:32:51,831 --> 00:32:53,128
They care about each other.

434
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:55,890
l mean, if you were in New York
and one of your neighbors got sick

435
00:32:56,102 --> 00:32:57,433
- what would you do?
- We`d call her.

436
00:32:57,637 --> 00:33:00,105
- To see if she was gonna die.
- So we could get the apartment.

437
00:33:00,406 --> 00:33:03,273
Let`s go. Up. Up. Up.

438
00:33:05,645 --> 00:33:07,442
Sarah?

439
00:33:08,581 --> 00:33:12,210
- Yoo-hoo.
- Yoo-hoo? ls she in there?

440
00:33:12,418 --> 00:33:13,783
- What are you doing?
- lt`s open.

441
00:33:13,986 --> 00:33:16,181
- That`s amazing.
- So sweet.

442
00:33:16,389 --> 00:33:18,050
And so trusting.

443
00:33:21,994 --> 00:33:23,291
<i>R</i>oger.

- <i>B</i>aby, grab me some nachos.
- Yes, dear.

What`s this?

00:34:49,148 --> 00:34:51,742
- <i>R</i>oger, put it down.
- What? <i>O</i>h, come on.

462
00:34:51,951 --> 00:34:53,919
- <i>R</i>oger.
- Why does it say Sarah?

463
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,382
<i>R</i>oger, you should put it down now.

464
00:34:55,588 --> 00:34:57,351

465
00:34:57,557 --> 00:34:59,252
<i>O</i>h, stop. Would you just quit?

466
00:34:59,692 --> 00:35:02,627

467
00:35:02,828 --> 00:35:04,625
We have to get out of here.

468
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,957
- Put it down. Come on.
- <i>O</i>K, let`s try and use this.

469
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:09,430
We have to go.

470
00:35:26,852 --> 00:35:28,843
l`m so embarrassed.

471
00:35:29,055 --> 00:35:31,888
l`m mortified. l`m famished.

472
00:35:36,062 --> 00:35:38,155
- <i>B</i>obbie.
- Yeah?

473
00:35:38,798 --> 00:35:41,096
- Are you making anthrax?
- Excuse me.

Someone brave?

477
00:35:46,505 --> 00:35:49,099
Dave says l got to do it myself,
like Sarah Sunderson.

478
00:35:49,308 --> 00:35:52,300
- <i>O</i>h, could you believe her?
- <i>B</i>ut, darling, her home is spotless.

479
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:55,505
And she`s having incredible sex
in the middle of the day

480
00:35:55,715 --> 00:35:56,909
with her husband.

481
00:35:57,116 --> 00:35:59,949
Well, l`m sorry, but my shrink says
l need creative chaos.

482
00:36:00,152 --> 00:36:02,450
- my therapist says l need boundaries.
- my doctor said l need

483
00:36:02,655 --> 00:36:05,385
enough electricity to jumpstart Vegas.

484
00:36:05,591 --> 00:36:07,582
- You ever done Zoloft?
- Kid stuff.

485
00:36:07,793 --> 00:36:11,194
Xanax. l worship Xanax.
l`m old-fashioned.

486
00:36:11,397 --> 00:36:13,297
l like Prozac with a Viagra chaser.

487
00:36:13,499 --> 00:36:15,490
You`re up, and you`re up.

494
00:36:35,621 --> 00:36:38,454
...and finally... Finally, l just couldn`t
take it anymore.

495
00:36:38,658 --> 00:36:41,627
l howled,
``You`ve become a gay <i>R</i>epublican.``

496
00:36:42,328 --> 00:36:44,728
And he said,
``What`s wrong with that?``

497
00:36:45,431 --> 00:36:46,693
l said, ``What`s wrong with that?

498
00:36:46,899 --> 00:36:48,867
``That`s like wanting to be gay
with a bad haircut.``

499
00:36:49,068 --> 00:36:50,365
Exactly.

500
00:36:50,569 --> 00:36:53,538
So the counselor suggested
that we move to the `burbs.

501
00:36:53,739 --> 00:36:56,537
- To find a balance.
- We moved here as a last resort.

502
00:36:57,276 --> 00:36:59,506
Court order. Don`t ask.

503
00:36:59,712 --> 00:37:02,579
<i>O</i>K. l know this is unthinkable,

504
00:37:02,782 --> 00:37:07,242
but what if we could actually learn
how to be happy...

505
00:37:07,453 --> 00:37:11,184
...without Paxil
or compulsive overeating?

506
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:14,757
What if we actually gave
this whole thing a try for real,

507
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,552
the whole Stepford thing?

508
00:37:35,481 --> 00:37:38,644
- <i>H</i>ey, yeah!
- <i>O</i>nly one can survive.

509
00:37:38,851 --> 00:37:41,684
<i>Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!</i>

510
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:44,048
<i>Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!</i>

511
00:37:44,256 --> 00:37:48,625
- <i>Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!</i>
- Come on, Kresbo baby.

512
00:37:48,828 --> 00:37:50,056
- <i>Zeus! Zeus!</i>
- <i>R</i>ip her bra off!

513
00:37:50,262 --> 00:37:52,253
<i>Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!</i>

514
00:37:52,465 --> 00:37:53,591
Yeah!

515
00:37:53,799 --> 00:37:58,259
- Yeah!
- Zeus rules the universe!

516
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,798
And Ted owes Walter
20 big ones!

517
00:38:04,543 --> 00:38:06,443
Ah, to be a man.

518
00:38:10,783 --> 00:38:13,251
So, Walt,

519
00:38:13,586 --> 00:38:16,521
you and Stepford,
it seems like a real match.

520
00:38:16,722 --> 00:38:22,388
l`ll say. l mean, the town
and the houses. This place.

521
00:38:22,595 --> 00:38:24,722
Well, it`s like a dream. lt`s like...

522
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:27,057
Like the way life was meant to be.

523
00:38:27,733 --> 00:38:31,499
And all of your wives.
<i>O</i>h, my God.

524
00:38:31,704 --> 00:38:35,834
<i>O</i>h, my God. They`re so... So...

525
00:38:36,275 --> 00:38:37,833
Sweet?

526
00:38:38,043 --> 00:38:39,635
Sizzling?

527
00:38:39,845 --> 00:38:41,176
Super fine?

528
00:39:04,637 --> 00:39:05,831
Well...

529
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:10,537
We are all so thrilled to be here
at the Stepford <i>B</i>ook Club,

530
00:39:10,743 --> 00:39:12,938
l can`t tell you.

531
00:39:14,046 --> 00:39:16,879
Now, l have just finished
the third volume

532
00:39:17,082 --> 00:39:19,573
of <i>R</i>obert Caro`s
<i>Life of Lyndon Johnson</i>,

533
00:39:19,785 --> 00:39:24,154
and l am dying
for the next installment.

534
00:39:24,723 --> 00:39:26,384
Well...

535
00:39:26,592 --> 00:39:30,926
That`s all marvelous,
but today we are going to discuss...

536
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:35,897
Well, it is probably the most important
book any of us will ever read.

537
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:39,901
Yes, it is provocative,
but it is also inspiring.

538
00:39:41,474 --> 00:39:45,171
The <i>H</i>eritage <i>H</i>ills Special Edition
Golden Deluxe Treasury

539
00:39:45,411 --> 00:39:48,847
of <i>Christmas Keepsakes</i>
<i>and CoIIectibIes.</i>

540
00:39:58,257 --> 00:39:59,451
This book said to me,

541
00:39:59,658 --> 00:40:04,027
``Let`s celebrate the birth
of our Lord Jesus Christ with yarn.``

542
00:40:06,232 --> 00:40:09,929
Now, <i>B</i>obbie, we all realize you`re
probably feeling a bit uncomfortable

543
00:40:10,135 --> 00:40:11,762
with this week`s book
because you`re...

544
00:40:11,971 --> 00:40:14,701
- <i>O</i>h, what`s the word l`m looking for?
- New?

545
00:40:14,907 --> 00:40:16,374
- Scared?
- Cranky?

546
00:40:16,742 --> 00:40:18,937
- Jewish.
- Same thing.

547
00:40:19,144 --> 00:40:21,942
<i>B</i>ut the <i>H</i>eritage <i>H</i>ill series
is very inclusive.

548
00:40:22,314 --> 00:40:26,080
ln fact, there is a whole chapter
about <i>H</i>anukkah.

549
00:40:26,585 --> 00:40:29,145
l just love the chapter on pinecones.

550
00:40:29,355 --> 00:40:31,789
They`re not just for wreaths
and centerpieces.

551
00:40:31,991 --> 00:40:35,586
You can use pinecones to create
a very special Yuletide menorah.

552
00:40:35,794 --> 00:40:37,625
Your pinecone snowman
could be Jewish.

553
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:39,422
Just add one of those little beanies.

554
00:40:40,099 --> 00:40:42,226
<i>O</i>r maybe l could just use
hundreds of pinecones

555
00:40:42,434 --> 00:40:44,629
to spell out the words ``<i>B</i>ig Jew``

556
00:40:44,837 --> 00:40:49,206
in letters 1 5 feet tall
in the snow in my front yard.

557
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:56,241
That`s a wonderful idea.

558
00:40:56,448 --> 00:40:59,110
- <i>O</i>h, yes, yes.
- That`s very wonderful.

559
00:40:59,318 --> 00:41:01,309
- Yes.
- She`s so smart.

560
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,216
l love the idea of creating
a life-sized Santa Claus,

561
00:41:04,423 --> 00:41:06,983
- all out of pinecones.
- <i>O</i>K, l love that.

562
00:41:07,493 --> 00:41:11,293
l`m going to use a pinecone in
my nativity as the baby Jesus.

563
00:41:11,931 --> 00:41:14,593
And l`m going to attach
a pinecone to my vibrator

564
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,031
and have a really merry
Christmas.

565
00:41:21,173 --> 00:41:23,038
<i>Here comes Santa CIaus</i>
<i>Here comes Santa CIaus</i>

566
00:41:23,242 --> 00:41:24,766
<i>Right down Santa CIaus Lane</i>

567
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:29,271
<i>He`s got a bag that`s fiIIed with toys</i>
<i>For the boys and girIs again</i>

568
00:41:33,218 --> 00:41:36,779
<i>So jump in bed</i>, <i>cover up your head</i>
<i>Because Santa CIaus comes tonight</i>

569
00:41:36,989 --> 00:41:39,480
- Who?
- <i>Santa CIaus comes tonight</i>

570
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,894
Joanna, how is she fitting in?

571
00:41:44,096 --> 00:41:45,427
Well...

572
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:48,794
<i>O</i>K...

573
00:41:49,134 --> 00:41:50,499
l`m among friends, right?

574
00:41:50,703 --> 00:41:51,692
- <i>O</i>f course.
- Yeah.

575
00:41:51,904 --> 00:41:53,132
So...

576
00:41:53,906 --> 00:41:57,000
Joanna and l had this big talk,

577
00:41:57,209 --> 00:41:58,733
and we were really open
with each other.

578
00:41:58,944 --> 00:42:02,675
l mean, we really got it all out.

579
00:42:02,881 --> 00:42:04,280
And l think from now on...

580
00:42:06,251 --> 00:42:08,446
...she`s gonna be very, very different.

581
00:42:12,958 --> 00:42:16,450
You think Joanna`s
really going to change?

582
00:42:17,129 --> 00:42:20,121
Yes, l do. Absolutely.

583
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:23,494
And how long
have you been married?

584
00:42:33,112 --> 00:42:34,909
- Ted!
- Yes.

585
00:42:35,114 --> 00:42:37,207
Don`t you owe Walter $20?

586
00:42:42,955 --> 00:42:45,082
That`s absolutely right, l do.

587
00:42:45,924 --> 00:42:47,585
<i>B</i>abe!

588
00:42:56,168 --> 00:42:57,726
Yes, darling?

589
00:42:57,936 --> 00:43:00,905
Walt, sit down.

590
00:43:05,244 --> 00:43:07,075
l need 20.

591
00:43:07,279 --> 00:43:10,180
- You know my PlN.
- <i>O</i>f course.

592
00:43:59,565 --> 00:44:01,328
She gives singles.

593
00:44:33,465 --> 00:44:35,365
Are these all for day camp
tomorrow?

594
00:44:35,567 --> 00:44:38,798
l just want you to be proud of me,
honey.

595
00:44:39,805 --> 00:44:41,602
Dad, watch this.

596
00:44:41,807 --> 00:44:43,604
<i>B</i>all.

597
00:44:46,211 --> 00:44:50,170
- Aren`t robots cool?
- <i>O</i>h, yeah.

598
00:44:50,582 --> 00:44:52,982
may l speak to the man
of the house?

599
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:55,612
- Snot-butt.
- Funkmaster markowitz.

600
00:44:55,821 --> 00:44:58,847
- Stone-cold Thriller Killer Kresbo.
- Cupcakes, anyone?

601
00:44:59,057 --> 00:45:00,888
- Cupcakes!
- Cupcakes.

602
00:45:01,093 --> 00:45:02,424
<i>H</i>ey, right on time.

603
00:45:02,628 --> 00:45:04,220
Jo, these are smoking.

604
00:45:04,429 --> 00:45:06,624
- Why don`t you make stuff like this?
- Why don`t you?

605
00:45:06,932 --> 00:45:09,457
<i>B</i>ecause l have a penis.

606
00:45:09,868 --> 00:45:12,234
- We should get moving.
- Yeah, we got a meeting.

607
00:45:12,437 --> 00:45:16,635
- At the men`s Association.
- When will you be home, honey?

608
00:45:20,279 --> 00:45:22,270
When l`m home.

609
00:45:42,134 --> 00:45:44,364
Call a sitter.

610
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:54,672
<i>B</i>obbie, are you sure about this?

611
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,008
We`re not spying. We`re just visiting.

612
00:45:58,217 --> 00:46:01,084
Fellas, l can`t tell you
how happy we are

613
00:46:01,286 --> 00:46:02,617
to welcome all of this new blood.

614
00:46:02,821 --> 00:46:04,516
- You said it, mike.
- That`s right.

615
00:46:04,723 --> 00:46:07,351
l love, love this space.

616
00:46:07,793 --> 00:46:10,956
lt`s very <i>R</i>alph Lauren meets

618
00:46:12,965 --> 00:46:14,159
- <i>R</i>oger, you promised.

00:46:14,366 --> 00:46:16,300
- Whore.
- <i>B</i>ore.

620
00:46:16,802 --> 00:46:18,064
- Sorry.
- No, no, no.

621
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:21,034
Jerry, you`re gonna find that
Stepford is very open-minded.

622
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,572
- <i>O</i>h, yeah.
- We welcome you and your partner,

623
00:46:23,775 --> 00:46:25,208
just like any other couple.

624
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:26,707
Absolutely. Any other.

625
00:46:26,912 --> 00:46:28,573
- That`s right.
- Girlfriend.

626
00:46:30,582 --> 00:46:33,210

627
00:46:34,286 --> 00:46:37,983
- To Stepford!
- Stepford!

628
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:41,792
You bet.

629
00:46:41,994 --> 00:46:43,484
Yeah.

630
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:48,498
Damn. Come on, let`s go.

631
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:51,168
You think this is all right,
sneaking around?

632
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:52,735
Add it up.

633
00:46:52,938 --> 00:46:56,738
All the women around here
are perfect sex-kitten bimbos.

634
00:46:56,942 --> 00:46:59,570
All the men are drooling nerds.

635
00:46:59,778 --> 00:47:01,973
- Doesn`t that seem strange?
- Not to me.

636
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,148
- Why not?
- l work in television.

637
00:47:04,349 --> 00:47:06,442
<i>O</i>h, come on.

638
00:47:07,219 --> 00:47:09,210
You know, Walter,
l think Joanna is right.

639
00:47:09,421 --> 00:47:11,514
- l think Stepford is the answer.
- She`s a great gal.

640
00:47:11,723 --> 00:47:13,748
<i>O</i>r she will be.

641
00:47:18,864 --> 00:47:22,163
- Come on, help me up.
- We shouldn`t be here.

642
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,858
<i>O</i>h, come on.
Don`t be such a chicken.

643
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:28,767
- l should be home with my cupcakes.
- Why?

644
00:47:28,974 --> 00:47:31,442
<i>B</i>ecause you only made
5,000 of them?

645
00:47:31,643 --> 00:47:35,739
- We`re trespassing.
- <i>O</i>nly if we get caught.

646
00:47:36,915 --> 00:47:39,213
Damn, l can`t see a thing.

647
00:47:39,418 --> 00:47:40,908
<i>O</i>h, there`s the light.
There it is.

648
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,349
No, <i>B</i>obbie.

649
00:47:59,071 --> 00:48:01,369
This is like some alien freak show.

650
00:48:01,573 --> 00:48:03,666
Why? They`re just family portraits.

651
00:48:03,875 --> 00:48:05,137
Yeah, that`s what l said.

652
00:48:09,915 --> 00:48:11,542
The lights.

653
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,281
We should get out of here.

654
00:48:20,625 --> 00:48:22,525
Should we run?

655
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,027
<i>O</i>h, my God.

656
00:49:03,468 --> 00:49:05,368
Clarice?

657
00:49:06,505 --> 00:49:08,837
- <i>H</i>i, girls!
- <i>R</i>oger!

658
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:10,474
You scared us.

659
00:49:10,675 --> 00:49:12,609
- What are you doing in here?
- What`s going on?

660
00:49:12,811 --> 00:49:15,712
Do they have hookers or old <i>PIayboy</i>s

<i>O</i>h, please.
They barely have throw pillows.

662
00:49:20,252 --> 00:49:22,379
- They`re coming.
- The menfolk.

663
00:49:22,587 --> 00:49:24,487
- Call us.

What was it?
Did you see anyone?

666
00:49:32,197 --> 00:49:33,391
Not a soul.

667
00:49:33,598 --> 00:49:36,692
<i>B</i>ut what`s back here anyway,
in all of these rooms?

668
00:49:36,902 --> 00:49:38,494
Storage? Sweaters?

669
00:49:38,703 --> 00:49:40,102
<i>B</i>odies?

670
00:49:40,505 --> 00:49:43,941
- Jerry.
- Do you see that door on your left?

671
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:46,641
Check it out.

672
00:49:46,845 --> 00:49:48,506
<i>O</i>h, boy.

Why, l can`t see anything.
lt`s dark.

674
00:49:54,252 --> 00:49:55,617
Use your flashlight.

675
00:49:55,821 --> 00:50:00,053
l feel like Nancy Drew in
<i>The Mystery of the Mid-Iife Crisis</i>.

676
00:50:06,798 --> 00:50:08,026
What am l looking for?

677
00:50:08,467 --> 00:50:10,196
Look down.

678
00:50:24,015 --> 00:50:25,812
Jerry?

679
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:32,548
<i>R</i>oger!

680
00:50:33,992 --> 00:50:35,186

682
00:50:38,096 --> 00:50:41,327
- <i>B</i>obbie?
- <i>R</i>oger!

683
00:50:42,634 --> 00:50:45,762
<i>R</i>oger said there was nothing going on
at the men`s Association.

684
00:50:45,971 --> 00:50:47,939
Well, then why doesn`t he
answer the phone?

685
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,937
- lt`s been two days.
- <i>B</i>obbie.

<i>R</i>oger!

688

lsn`t that his favorite shirt,
the Dolce & Gabbana?

689
00:51:06,558 --> 00:51:08,082
The Guccis.

690
00:51:08,293 --> 00:51:10,659
- And the Versace.
- maybe he`s donating them.

691
00:51:10,862 --> 00:51:13,194
To what? The gay homeless?

692
00:51:14,132 --> 00:51:15,497
<i>H</i>e loved this.

00:51:16,768 --> 00:51:19,396

695
00:51:23,875 --> 00:51:25,706
Viggo.

Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
l`m Jerry <i>H</i>armon, and l...

697
00:51:45,297 --> 00:51:49,734
l know l`m pretty new here,
but already l feel so at home.

698
00:51:50,202 --> 00:51:52,067
Why did Jerry ask us
to meet him here?

699
00:51:52,637 --> 00:51:57,336
Proud that l can introduce Stepford`s
brand-new candidate for state senate.

700
00:51:57,542 --> 00:52:02,570
Ladies and gentlemen,
l give you mr. <i>R</i>oger <i>B</i>annister.

701
00:52:02,781 --> 00:52:04,214
What?

702
00:52:09,754 --> 00:52:11,449
<i>H</i>e`s wonderful.

703
00:52:21,366 --> 00:52:22,560
Thank you.

704
00:52:23,101 --> 00:52:25,092
Thank you so much.

705
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:28,362
You may very well ask, what are
my qualifications for higher office?

706
00:52:28,573 --> 00:52:33,875
Well, l believe in Stepford, America
and the power of prayer.

707
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:37,310
Values l`ve discovered thanks
to my partner,

708
00:52:37,515 --> 00:52:40,916
in life and in the Lord,
Jerry <i>H</i>armon.

<i>R</i>oger. <i>R</i>oger.

710
00:52:46,891 --> 00:52:49,121
Yes. ls there a question?
mrs. markowitz?

711
00:52:50,095 --> 00:52:53,155
So you two are happy now?

712
00:52:53,365 --> 00:52:55,959
more than ever. <i>B</i>ecause now
l know that being gay doesn`t mean

713
00:52:56,167 --> 00:53:00,194
a guy has to be effeminate
or flamboyant or sensitive.

714
00:53:00,405 --> 00:53:02,202
- l`m no sissy.
- No.

715
00:53:02,407 --> 00:53:04,034
- Way to go, <i>R</i>oger!
- That`s a man!

716
00:53:04,242 --> 00:53:07,439
- <i>R</i>oger?
- Yes. mrs. Walter Kresby.

717
00:53:07,646 --> 00:53:10,114
<i>R</i>oger, l don`t understand.
You were out there, you were <i>R</i>oger.

718
00:53:10,315 --> 00:53:11,714
And now...

719
00:53:11,916 --> 00:53:13,679
Now you`re different.
Your hair, your clothes.

720
00:53:13,885 --> 00:53:16,854
- You`re like someone else.
- People change.

721
00:53:17,055 --> 00:53:18,818
You can`t stop Stepford.

722
00:53:19,024 --> 00:53:22,892
<i>You can`t stop Stepford.</i>
<i>You can`t stop Stepford.</i>

723
00:53:23,094 --> 00:53:26,393
<i>You can`t stop Stepford.</i>
<i>You can`t stop Stepford.</i>

724
00:53:26,598 --> 00:53:29,692
<i>You can`t stop Stepford.</i>
<i>You can`t stop Stepford.</i>

725
00:53:29,901 --> 00:53:33,200
<i>You can`t stop Stepford.</i>
<i>You can`t stop Stepford.</i>

726
00:53:33,405 --> 00:53:35,896
<i>You can`t stop Stepford.</i>
<i>You can`t stop Stepford.</i>

727
00:53:36,107 --> 00:53:39,406
<i>You can`t stop Stepford.</i>
<i>You can`t stop Stepford.</i>

728
00:53:39,611 --> 00:53:42,273
<i>You can`t stop Stepford.</i>
<i>You can`t stop Stepford.</i>

729
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,971
<i>You can`t stop Stepford.</i>
<i>You can`t stop Stepford.</i>

730
00:53:45,183 --> 00:53:48,050
<i>You can`t stop Stepford.</i>
<i>You can`t stop Stepford.</i>

731
00:53:48,253 --> 00:53:49,686
So that`s why we have
to leave Stepford?

732
00:53:49,888 --> 00:53:52,152
- l`m not following.
- <i>O</i>K.

733
00:53:52,357 --> 00:53:56,953
<i>B</i>efore, <i>R</i>oger was witty
and stylish and ironic.

734
00:53:57,162 --> 00:53:58,925
- And l`m sure he still is.
- No.

735
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:01,997
Now he`s making speeches
in a <i>B</i>rooks <i>B</i>rothers suit.

736
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,031
<i>H</i>ey, there`s lots of ways to be gay.

737
00:54:04,235 --> 00:54:07,363
Don`t try to make him
into a stereotype.

738
00:54:08,473 --> 00:54:11,033
<i>B</i>obbie is right,
and she`s leaving too.

739
00:54:11,242 --> 00:54:14,109
This place does something to people.

740
00:54:14,746 --> 00:54:18,512
All of the women are always busy
and perfect and smiling,

741
00:54:18,717 --> 00:54:20,548
and all of the men are always happy.

742
00:54:20,752 --> 00:54:24,711
- And that`s a problem because...?
- <i>B</i>ecause it`s not normal, Walter.

743
00:54:24,923 --> 00:54:28,222
lt`s... lt`s not the world. lt`s not us.

744
00:54:28,927 --> 00:54:31,589
And l`m picking up our kids
from camp right now,

745
00:54:31,796 --> 00:54:34,697
and we`re getting out of here.

746
00:54:36,234 --> 00:54:38,759
With or without you.

747
00:54:58,022 --> 00:54:59,956
<i>Secure.</i>

748
00:55:01,259 --> 00:55:03,227
You`ll never change, will you?

749
00:55:04,095 --> 00:55:05,926
Not really.

750
00:55:06,131 --> 00:55:07,826
<i>O</i>pen the door.

751
00:55:14,606 --> 00:55:16,699
<i>UnIock front.</i>

752
00:55:17,175 --> 00:55:19,075
And you`re right.

753
00:55:22,981 --> 00:55:24,471
About what?

754
00:55:26,618 --> 00:55:30,611
lf you`re that unhappy,
then we should move.

755
00:55:30,822 --> 00:55:33,313
maybe head back to the city.

756
00:55:33,725 --> 00:55:35,989
We could leave tomorrow.

757
00:55:37,629 --> 00:55:39,028
Thank you.

758
00:55:43,401 --> 00:55:44,993

What do you got there? <i>H</i>uh?

760

762
00:57:40,952 --> 00:57:44,410

And thank you for leaving
your requests on my e-mail.

No, no coffee. <i>B</i>obbie, <i>B</i>obbie.

all of the women here,
they used to be big deals,

798
01:00:10,301 --> 01:00:11,325
l mean, big deals.

799
01:00:11,536 --> 01:00:13,800
CE<i>O</i>s, executives, judges.

800
01:00:14,005 --> 01:00:16,906
Sarah Sunderson,
she used to run an airline.

801
01:00:17,108 --> 01:00:19,235
With that perfect skin.

802
01:00:19,444 --> 01:00:21,571
No. No, no, no.
She didn`t used to look like that.

803
01:00:21,779 --> 01:00:23,440
- None of the women did. They...
- Coffee?

804
01:00:23,948 --> 01:00:26,178
Coffee? No. No coffee.

<i>B</i>obbie. <i>B</i>obbie. This isn`t you.

And my husband and my family
and making a perfect home.

You`re driven.

01:01:00,485 --> 01:01:02,749
- Well, sometimes.
- And you`re selfish.

819
01:01:03,054 --> 01:01:05,522
- You wanna rule the world.
- No.

l would like to speak to my children.

827
01:01:29,914 --> 01:01:33,008
l`m coming to pick them up
right now.

828
01:01:35,286 --> 01:01:36,776
What?

829
01:01:40,691 --> 01:01:42,716
Walter!

830
01:01:43,227 --> 01:01:45,127
Walter, where are you?

831
01:01:45,329 --> 01:01:47,422
l know you`ve got the kids.

832
01:01:47,632 --> 01:01:49,964
Pete, Kimberly!

833
01:02:52,463 --> 01:02:54,897
<i>O</i>h, boys.

834
01:02:56,868 --> 01:02:57,926
Welcome.

835
01:03:15,586 --> 01:03:16,917
Where are my children?

836
01:03:17,121 --> 01:03:20,284
- They`re perfectly safe.
- Where are my children?

837
01:03:21,259 --> 01:03:23,489
- You`ll see them soon.
- Where`s Walter?

838
01:03:30,201 --> 01:03:32,328
<i>H</i>ow could you do this?

839
01:03:33,204 --> 01:03:37,072
Ever since we met,
you`ve beaten me at everything.

840
01:03:37,275 --> 01:03:38,674
You`re better educated.

841
01:03:39,176 --> 01:03:40,973
You`re stronger, you`re faster.

842
01:03:41,178 --> 01:03:43,510
You`re a better dancer,
a better tennis player.

843
01:03:43,814 --> 01:03:45,714
You`ve always earned
at least six figures more

844
01:03:45,917 --> 01:03:47,817
than l could ever dream of.

845
01:03:48,219 --> 01:03:49,846
You`re a better speaker,

846
01:03:50,054 --> 01:03:52,352
a better executive.

847
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:55,249
You`re even better at sex.
Don`t deny it.

848
01:03:56,093 --> 01:03:57,993
l wasn`t going to.

849
01:03:58,663 --> 01:03:59,960
Well, don`t l get anything?

850
01:04:00,164 --> 01:04:01,324
You got me.

851
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:03,567
No, l got to hold your purse.

852
01:04:03,768 --> 01:04:06,794
l got to tell the kids
that you`d be late again.

853
01:04:07,004 --> 01:04:09,529
l got to tell the press
that you had no comment.

854
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:11,105
l got to work for you.

855
01:04:11,309 --> 01:04:12,367
With me.

856
01:04:12,576 --> 01:04:14,476
Under you.

857
01:04:14,745 --> 01:04:16,440
All of us.

858
01:04:16,647 --> 01:04:19,081
We married wonder women.

859
01:04:19,283 --> 01:04:21,148
Supergirls.

860
01:04:21,352 --> 01:04:24,344
Amazon queens.
Well, you know what that makes us?

861
01:04:24,722 --> 01:04:28,158
Smart, worthy, lucky.

862
01:04:28,359 --> 01:04:30,122
We`re the wuss.

863
01:04:30,861 --> 01:04:32,522
The wind beneath your wings.

864
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:34,459
Your support system.

865
01:04:34,665 --> 01:04:36,155
- We`re the girl.
- And we don`t like it.

866
01:04:36,367 --> 01:04:37,698
- No, we don`t.
- Yeah, that`s right.

867
01:04:37,902 --> 01:04:39,494
- You`re damn right.
- Yeah. That`s right.

868
01:04:39,704 --> 01:04:41,934
And is this your answer,
to kill us?

869
01:04:42,139 --> 01:04:45,597
<i>O</i>h, no. Nothing like that.
We help you. We perfect you.

870

<i>B</i>y turning us into robots?

871
01:04:47,778 --> 01:04:50,713
Does any fraction of these women
still exist?

872
01:04:50,915 --> 01:04:54,043
<i>O</i>f course. Almost everything.

873
01:04:54,251 --> 01:04:56,879
- Shall we show her?
- Show me what?

874
01:04:57,088 --> 01:05:02,025
lt`s a promotional thing l`ve been
working on for when we go global.

875
01:05:02,893 --> 01:05:05,487
Walter, l don`t think you`ve seen this.

876
01:05:18,409 --> 01:05:20,673
<i>Some guys ask</i>, <i>how do we do it?</i>

877
01:05:20,878 --> 01:05:24,075

885
01:05:54,378 --> 01:05:57,711
<i>First</i>, <i>we Iocate her brain.</i>

886
01:05:57,915 --> 01:06:00,907
<i>We insert a few nanochips.</i>

887
01:06:01,118 --> 01:06:02,380
<i>Then we program them.</i>

888
01:06:03,454 --> 01:06:06,048

<i>WeIcome to the future.</i>

898

lt`s a painting again.

899
01:06:51,135 --> 01:06:53,035
l should explain. You see,

900
01:06:53,471 --> 01:06:55,632
my real name isn`t mike.

901
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:58,104
lt`s just a nickname
from where l used to work.

902
01:06:58,476 --> 01:07:00,967
- Where?
- microsoft.

903
01:07:01,512 --> 01:07:03,343
- NASA.
- Disney.

904
01:07:04,081 --> 01:07:05,048
A<i>O</i>L.

905
01:07:05,249 --> 01:07:06,773
ls that why the women
are so slow?

906
01:07:07,318 --> 01:07:08,285
Joanna.

907
01:07:08,652 --> 01:07:11,951
ls this what you really want?

908
01:07:12,456 --> 01:07:14,390
Women who behave like slaves,

909
01:07:14,592 --> 01:07:18,187
women who are obsessed
with cleaning their kitchens

910
01:07:18,395 --> 01:07:19,362
and doing their hair,

911
01:07:19,563 --> 01:07:22,191
women who never challenge you
in any way,

912
01:07:22,399 --> 01:07:25,061
women who exist
only to wait on you hand and foot?

913
01:07:25,603 --> 01:07:26,934
- Yeah.
- That sounds good to me.

914
01:07:27,138 --> 01:07:28,935
Joanna, you`re a brilliant woman.

915
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:31,165
Surely you can appreciate,
at the very least,

916
01:07:31,375 --> 01:07:32,808
the genius of the concept.

917
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:36,207
Picture, if you could streamline
your spouse,

918
01:07:36,981 --> 01:07:40,144
if you could overhaul
every annoying habit,

919
01:07:40,351 --> 01:07:42,012
every physical flaw,

920
01:07:42,219 --> 01:07:45,484
every moment of whining
and nagging and farting in bed.

921
01:07:45,689 --> 01:07:47,213
lmagine...

922
01:07:47,591 --> 01:07:50,185
...if you could enjoy
the person you loved,

923
01:07:50,394 --> 01:07:52,089
but only at their very best.

924
01:07:53,931 --> 01:07:57,594
And the only reason for your anger,

925
01:07:58,169 --> 01:08:01,400
your resentment, your rage
is really very simple.

926
01:08:01,705 --> 01:08:04,606
You`re furious
because we thought of it first.

927
01:08:04,808 --> 01:08:06,105
While you were trying
to become men,

928
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:08,244
we decided to become gods.

929
01:08:10,281 --> 01:08:11,248
Let me ask you something,

930
01:08:11,448 --> 01:08:15,111
these machines,
these Stepford Wives,

931
01:08:15,319 --> 01:08:16,877
can they say, ``l love you``?

932
01:08:18,389 --> 01:08:19,356
mike.

933
01:08:19,723 --> 01:08:20,781
<i>O</i>f course.

Good evening, everyone.

947
01:12:18,095 --> 01:12:19,426

all of our wonderful wives
and their happy, happy husbands.

949
01:12:23,467 --> 01:12:27,426
Tonight is truly the highlight
of our year because tonight

950
01:12:27,638 --> 01:12:31,836
we honor our very newest citizens
of Stepford.

951
01:12:32,042 --> 01:12:34,840
ln my opinion, they are
the cream of the crop in couple

952
01:12:35,245 --> 01:12:37,509
that proudly proclaims Stepford

953
01:12:39,283 --> 01:12:40,682
the American way of love.

954
01:13:08,712 --> 01:13:10,373
Now...

955
01:13:12,182 --> 01:13:14,776

mike, what`s happening?

1003
01:19:04,201 --> 01:19:06,829
l was in the garden,
and l was dreaming of your...

1004
01:19:07,037 --> 01:19:09,164
Your smile and your after-shave.

1005
01:19:09,773 --> 01:19:11,172
And l realized...

1006
01:19:13,076 --> 01:19:15,340
...l can do better.

1007
01:19:26,323 --> 01:19:28,791
- Walt.
- She`s not a robot.

1008
01:19:29,125 --> 01:19:30,092
- What?
- What?

1009
01:19:30,293 --> 01:19:31,555
What, she`s not a robot?

1010
01:19:32,062 --> 01:19:33,290
She never was.

1011
01:19:40,403 --> 01:19:41,597
Wait a second.

1012
01:19:43,106 --> 01:19:45,734
- l couldn`t do it.
- What?

1013
01:19:46,243 --> 01:19:47,210
Why not?

1014
01:19:47,811 --> 01:19:49,972
<i>B</i>ecause she`s not a science project.

1015
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:52,910
<i>B</i>ecause l didn`t marry something
from <i>R</i>adioShack.

1016
01:19:54,417 --> 01:19:55,384
That`s a shame.

1017
01:19:56,052 --> 01:19:57,349
No.

1018
01:19:57,988 --> 01:19:59,649
That`s a man.

1019
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:08,492
l thought you were ready.

1020
01:20:09,666 --> 01:20:12,931
l thought... l thought you were ready.
l thought l knew you.

1021
01:20:14,337 --> 01:20:16,328
You`re a disgrace.

1022
01:20:18,775 --> 01:20:20,800
To everything this town stands for.

1023
01:20:22,812 --> 01:20:24,006
To the future.

1024
01:20:24,247 --> 01:20:26,112
That`s right, that`s right. Tell him.

1025
01:20:26,783 --> 01:20:28,478
You`re gonna have to pay for that.

1026
01:20:34,457 --> 01:20:35,947
Don`t you touch him.

1027
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:37,421
No!

1028
01:21:13,396 --> 01:21:16,160
<i>H</i>e`s a Stepford <i>H</i>usband?

1029
01:21:17,901 --> 01:21:20,165
An angel.

1030
01:21:21,438 --> 01:21:23,906
Now he`s just...

1031
01:21:24,507 --> 01:21:27,965
...spare parts, thanks to you.

1032
01:21:28,178 --> 01:21:30,908
<i>B</i>ut what are you?
Are you a person or a machine?

1033
01:21:31,481 --> 01:21:32,812
l`m a lady.

1034
01:21:33,016 --> 01:21:35,416
A real lady?

1035
01:21:35,618 --> 01:21:36,846
- Every inch.
- Wait.

1036
01:21:37,053 --> 01:21:39,521
Wait, a real, real lady?
Are you a human being?

1037
01:21:39,723 --> 01:21:43,159
Yes, and l may very well be
the only decent human being left.

1038
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,828
- ln Stepford?
- ln the world!

1039
01:21:46,463 --> 01:21:47,555
She`s fabulous.

1040
01:21:47,764 --> 01:21:51,894
All of this, mike, the wives, Stepford,
this was all your idea?

1041
01:21:52,102 --> 01:21:55,128
Yes.
All l wanted was a better world.

1042
01:21:55,338 --> 01:22:00,002
A world where men were men
and women were cherished and lovely.

1043
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:03,441
Does anyone have a screwdriver?

1044
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:05,508
She`s nuts.

1045
01:22:14,424 --> 01:22:17,484
A world of romance and beauty,

1046
01:22:17,694 --> 01:22:21,858
of tuxedos and chiffon,
a perfect world.

1047
01:22:22,065 --> 01:22:24,090
<i>B</i>ut you were married to a robot.

1048
01:22:24,567 --> 01:22:26,558
The perfect man.

1049
01:22:27,504 --> 01:22:29,938
And all l wanted was to make you,
all of you...

1050
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:32,301
...into perfect women.

1051
01:22:32,642 --> 01:22:35,338
We don`t need to be perfect.

1052
01:22:35,545 --> 01:22:37,103
<i>H</i>ow could you do this to us?

1053
01:22:37,313 --> 01:22:39,213
<i>B</i>ecause l was just like you.

1054
01:22:39,416 --> 01:22:41,782
<i>O</i>verstressed, overbooked,
under-loved.

1055
01:22:42,819 --> 01:22:47,153
l was the world`s foremost
brain surgeon and genetic engineer.

1056
01:22:47,357 --> 01:22:51,987
l had top-secret contracts
with the Pentagon, Apple and mattel.

1057
01:22:52,195 --> 01:22:53,321
l was driven.

1058
01:22:53,530 --> 01:22:54,997
Exhausted.

1059
01:22:55,198 --> 01:22:58,497
Until late one night,
l came home to find...

1060
01:23:00,170 --> 01:23:01,797
...mike.

1061
01:23:03,473 --> 01:23:05,498
With Patricia.

1062
01:23:06,743 --> 01:23:08,677
my brilliant...

1063
01:23:09,279 --> 01:23:11,076
...blond...

1064
01:23:12,182 --> 01:23:16,084
...2 1 -year-old research assistant.

1065
01:23:16,286 --> 01:23:18,379
lt was all so...

1066
01:23:20,824 --> 01:23:22,587
...ugly.

1067
01:23:24,461 --> 01:23:28,693
Then early the next morning,
as l gazed across the breakfast table

1068
01:23:28,898 --> 01:23:32,527
at their lifeless bodies, l thought...

1069
01:23:32,735 --> 01:23:34,930
...``What have l done?``

1070
01:23:35,138 --> 01:23:37,504
<i>B</i>ut more importantly...

1071
01:23:37,707 --> 01:23:40,676
...what l could do to make the world
more beautiful?

1072
01:23:41,010 --> 01:23:42,671
l had the skills.

1073
01:23:43,113 --> 01:23:46,480
<i>B</i>ut l needed help
to realize my larger vision.

1074
01:23:46,683 --> 01:23:47,843
And so l made...

1075
01:23:49,586 --> 01:23:51,144
...mike.

1076
01:23:52,055 --> 01:23:54,819
<i>B</i>ecause he was someone
other men would listen to.

1077
01:23:55,258 --> 01:23:57,590
And then l asked myself,

1078
01:23:57,794 --> 01:24:03,232
``Where would people never notice
a town full of robots?

1079
01:24:03,433 --> 01:24:05,901
``Connecticut.``

1080
01:24:06,102 --> 01:24:09,731
So l decided
to turn back the clock,

1081
01:24:09,939 --> 01:24:12,464
to a time before overtime,

1082
01:24:12,675 --> 01:24:14,404
before quality time,

1083
01:24:14,611 --> 01:24:16,579
before women
were turning themselves into robots.

1084
01:24:18,548 --> 01:24:20,038
- <i>B</i>ack off!
- Sorry.

1085
01:24:20,650 --> 01:24:22,914
Why didn`t you change the men too?

1086
01:24:23,119 --> 01:24:24,086
That`s next.

1087
01:24:25,655 --> 01:24:27,145
You`re insane.

1088
01:24:27,690 --> 01:24:32,389
l`m in love with a waltz
and a town...

1089
01:24:34,831 --> 01:24:36,890
...and a man.

1090
01:25:31,287 --> 01:25:33,016
So, Joanna, you produced
the hard-hitting documentary,

1091
01:25:33,223 --> 01:25:35,054
<i>Stepford: The Secret</i>
<i>of the Suburbs.</i>

1092
01:25:35,258 --> 01:25:38,056
And won... Five Emmys, was it?

1093
01:25:38,261 --> 01:25:39,421
<i>O</i>h, six.

1094
01:25:39,629 --> 01:25:41,893
- She`s shy.
- And so humble.

1095
01:25:42,098 --> 01:25:45,295
And, <i>B</i>obbie, your ordeal
has lead to a bestseller.

1096
01:25:45,501 --> 01:25:46,991
You know, l just can`t hold a grudge.

1097
01:25:47,203 --> 01:25:48,830
So l`ve written my very first
book of poetry.

1098
01:25:49,038 --> 01:25:52,906
And it`s all about hope
and communication

1099
01:25:53,109 --> 01:25:54,337
and the healing power of love.

1100
01:25:54,544 --> 01:25:55,806
What is it called?

1101
01:25:56,012 --> 01:25:58,003
<i>Wait UntiI He`s AsIeep</i>,
<i>Then Cut It Off.</i>

1102
01:25:58,214 --> 01:26:00,114
- lt`s a page-turner.
- l cried.

1103
01:26:00,316 --> 01:26:01,749
Now, <i>R</i>oger, good news.

1104
01:26:01,951 --> 01:26:04,442
You ran and won.
You`re in the state senate.

1105
01:26:04,921 --> 01:26:06,821
- lndependent.
- Next stop, the White <i>H</i>ouse.

1106
01:26:07,023 --> 01:26:09,924
- Yes, this country needs highlights.
- That`s our hero.

1107
01:26:10,126 --> 01:26:12,185
And, Jo, Walter really came through
for you,

1108
01:26:12,395 --> 01:26:16,957
so how`s your marriage now?
ls everything just perfect?

1109
01:26:17,166 --> 01:26:18,133
No way.

1110
01:26:18,334 --> 01:26:20,529
<i>B</i>ut we`re doing just great.

1111
01:26:20,737 --> 01:26:22,329
<i>B</i>ecause, um...

1112
01:26:22,839 --> 01:26:25,774
<i>B</i>ecause now, now we know for
sure that it`s not about perfection.

1113
01:26:25,975 --> 01:26:28,535
Perfect. Perfect doesn`t work.

1114
01:26:28,745 --> 01:26:30,406
What about
all those other husbands?

1115
01:26:30,613 --> 01:26:34,014
Are they still angry? Do they still want
all these women to be robots?

1116
01:26:34,217 --> 01:26:35,809
<i>O</i>f course. men are pigs.

1117
01:26:36,019 --> 01:26:39,420
They`re disgusting, they`re frightened,
repulsive little rodents.

1118
01:26:39,622 --> 01:26:41,249
<i>B</i>ut we`re trying to help them,
right, <i>B</i>obbie?

1119
01:26:41,457 --> 01:26:44,153
- <i>R</i>ight.
- Yes, we`re trying to reeducate them.

1120
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:45,520
And where are they?

1121
01:26:45,795 --> 01:26:48,093
<i>O</i>h. <i>O</i>h, they`re still in Stepford.

1122
01:26:48,298 --> 01:26:50,027
Under house arrest.

1123
01:26:56,239 --> 01:26:57,206
<i>H</i>ey, you guys.

1124
01:26:57,407 --> 01:26:59,136
Which aisle is quilted paper towels?

1125
01:26:59,342 --> 01:27:01,606
lf l don`t get the right kind,
my wife`s gonna kill me.

1126
01:27:01,811 --> 01:27:03,676
<i>O</i>h, aisle three. And l need...

1127
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:06,440
No talking, keep shopping.
