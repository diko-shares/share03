00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.420
Year after year, 20-something
women come to New York City...

2
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.420
...in search of the two L's:

3
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.800
Labels and love.

4
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.840
- Yeah.
- It's the best.

5
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.010
Hot dress!

6
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.520
Twenty years ago, I was one of them.

7
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.740
Having gotten the knack for labels early,
I concentrated on my search for love.

8
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.080
Turns out, a knockoff is not as easy to spot
when it comes to love.

9
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.160
What? You're married?

10
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.580
You fucking asshole!
Motherfucker, you're married?

11
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.090
- Until it is.
- I fucking hate you.

12
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.710
That is why you need help to spot them.

13
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.880
Lots of help.

14
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.050
Help also known as Charlotte York...

15
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.560
...Miranda Hobbes...

16
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.140
...and Samantha Jones.

17
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.850
- Oh, my God, look at his.
Hey.

18
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.400
Hi, how are you?

19
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.240
Oh, well.

20
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.160
My name is Carrie Bradshaw,
and I'm a writer.

21
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.120
Year after year,
my single girlfriends were my salvation.

22
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.910
And as it turns out, my meal ticket.

23
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.170
I've been dating since I was 15.
I'm exhausted. Where is he?

24
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.760
Charlotte was looking
for the pertect love.

25
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.970
- Trey can't get it up.
- Well, almost perfect.

26
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.680
I'm becoming a Jew.

27
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.850
We're not barren,
we're reproductively challenged.

28
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.270
- They're giving us a baby.
- That's our baby.

29
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.820
So Charlotte and Harry journeyed
to China and back...

30
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.190
...for their daughter, Lily.

31
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.570
Miranda was a disciple of tough love.

32
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.450
Bye. Great sex.

33
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.870
- Steve, I'm pregnant.
- You're what?

34
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.080
Carrie.

35
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.120
I, Miranda Hobbes,
take you, Steve Brady...

36
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.290
And Miranda journeyed to Brooklyn
for Brady and Steve.

37
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.630
Who wants a Popsicle?

38
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.800
Oh, man. Boy.

39
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.880
Samantha's love was sex.

40
00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.590
Lots of sex.

41
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.300
I'm dating a guy
with the funkiest-tasting spunk.

42
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.810
Can I cancel my rice pudding?

43
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.560
And then she found a man
that combined sex and love.

44
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.060
I'm gonna help you be a star.

45
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.150
Yes, he is interested...

46
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.530
So Samantha journeyed to Hollywood
with television star Smith Jerrod.

47
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.950
As for me,
I was looking for something big.

48
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.410
Get in.

49
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.620
Mr. Big. Turns out when that big
love comes along, it's not always easy.

50
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.040
Just tell me I'm the one.

51
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.340
And despite all the other chapters
of my life...

52
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.010
...no one was ever quite
big enough until...

53
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.510
Carrie, you're the one.

54
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.550
And just like that, I was.

55
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.970
Three books and three years later...

56
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.900
...we still feel like those four single girls.

57
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.650
And even though time had moved us on...

58
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.360
...I managed to stay exactly where I was:

59
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.700
In love.

60
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.710
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

61
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.880
I got a good feeling about this one, kid.

62
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.130
Oh, I hope so.
I've always loved this block.

63
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.090
Hi, 3C?

64
00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.140
Finding the perfect apartment
in New York City...

65
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.980
...is like finding the perfect partner.
It can take years.

66
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.860
- So how many is this?
- Thirty-three.

67
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.190
Lucky 33.

68
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.320
- The worst. I just left you a message.
- And the kitchen's through here.

69
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.410
That's the window with the best view.

70
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.830
Thirty-four? Lucky 34?

71
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.340
Well, if anything else opens up,
let us know.

72
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.340
We're very interested in this building.

73
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.380
I do have another apartment
that's not even on the market yet.

74
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.800
Care to take a look?

75
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.010
- Sure.
- Sure.

76
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.760
All right, then.

77
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.140
It's more than you were looking to pay.

78
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.600
- How much more?
- More.

79
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.950
So this is where they keep the light.

80
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.160
Oh, my God.

81
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.200
I have died
and gone to real-estate heaven.

82
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.290
Just a simple home for two.

83
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.790
And across the rooftop terrace...

84
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.260
What, nirvana?

85
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.430
Hello. I live here.

86
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.770
Your wife has quite a sense of humor.

87
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.020
- They're not married.
- He's my boyfriend.

88
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.360
This way.

89
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.150
Aren't I a little old
to be introduced as your boyfriend?

90
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.160
Point taken. From now on,
you'll be my man-friend.

91
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.080
- That sounds like a dog.
- Well, if the shoe fits...

92
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.660
And this is the master bedroom.

93
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.500
It's hideous. I hate it. Hurts my eyes.

94
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:24.510
- How is this place even available?
- Nasty divorce.

95
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.800
If you live here,
what is there to fight about?

96
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.440
- Well, now I understand the divorce.
- I can build you a better closet.

97
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.860
Welcome home, baby.

98
00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.030
Can...? Can we afford this?

99
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.910
I got it.

100
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.660
Okay, let's sign some contracts.

101
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.080
"I got it." Just like that.

102
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.210
- Like he was picking up a check for coffee.
- It sounds perfect.

103
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.670
Except for the closet,
which Big says he can redo.

104
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.460
And he says the kitchen needs work.

105
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.970
Of course, I don't know about that
because I keep sweaters in my stove.

106
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.260
So he bought it
and you'll live there with him.

107
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:10.720
Yes, together. That's right.

108
00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.560
But he'll own it, so
you're keeping your own place, right?

109
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.310
I haven't figured out the details,
but I'm a smart girl.

110
00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.890
I'll figure out something
that I'm comfortable with.

111
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.150
I just wanna be sure
that you're being smart.

112
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.730
And I love you for that.

113
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.480
But for now,
can't you stop worrying for me...

114
00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.860
...and just go ahead and feel
what I want you to feel, jealous?

115
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:34.490
Oh, jealous of me living in this
gorgeous penthouse in Manhattan.

116
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.490
- All right, I'm jealous.
- Thanks.

117
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.580
You live in real-estate heaven
and I live in Brooklyn.

118
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.630
New York magazine said
Brooklyn is the new Manhattan.

119
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.630
Whoever wrote that lives in Brooklyn.

120
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.210
- Hey, there she is. Hey, Hollywood.
- Hey.

121
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.840
Oh, lady. Hi.

122
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.970
- How was your flight?
- Fabulous.

123
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.180
- Oh, good.
- Good.

124
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:55.970
- Let's go in. I'm so excited.
Show us.

125
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:02.400
It was a rare occasion that brought
all types of New York women together.

126
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.110
Sorry.

127
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.400
Blair Elkenn was a waitress
turned model turned actress...

128
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.450
...turned billionaire's girlfriend
who came home one night...

129
00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:15.280
...to find herself unceremoniously
turned out on the street.

130
00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:16.450
Oh, my God.

131
00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.950
And now she was getting
the ultimate breakup revenge:

132
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.170
An embarrassing
and very public auction...

133
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.460
...of all the jewelry he had given her
when they were happy.

134
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.960
There it is. My baby.

135
00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:30.630
Oh, she's a beauty.

136
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.760
When I saw it in the catalog,
I said to Smith:

137
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:38.390
"This flower ring is the essence of me.
One of a kind, filled with fire."

138
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.480
- And a little too much.
- Exactly.

139
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.190
Let's go spend some of
my hard-earned Hollywood money.

140
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.320
And now Lot 39, the flower ring.

141
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.530
That's it.

142
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:52.450
We'd like to start the bidding
on this at $10,000, please.

143
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.450
At ten-thousand doll...
Thank you, madam. At 10,000.

144
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.120
Fifteen thousand. At $15,000.

145
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:01.160
Hey, she's bidding for somebody
on the phone.

146
00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.830
That's not fair.
- Bitch.

147
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
The gloves are off.

148
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.750
At $30,000. Now it's against you.
Thirty-five thousand.

149
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.340
- I work hard, I deserve this.
At 40,000 now.

150
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.010
At 40? Forty thousand?
Forty thousand, thank you.

151
00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.140
Forty-five thousand. At $45,000.
Now 50,000?

152
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.850
Fifty fucking thousand.

153
00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:27.270
At 50,000. Fifty-five thousand?
At $55,000 against you.

154
00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.860
Would you like to say 60?
Sixty to our colorful bidder? At 60,000?

155
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.110
I draw the line at 50.

156
00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.740
I thought this auction would be more fun,
but it's kind of sad.

157
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:40.990
Isn't it?

158
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.330
I thought it was just sad for me
because I know her.

159
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.210
But it really is sad, huh?

160
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:48.750
And it's funny
because they were so happy.

161
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.380
- Yeah, till they weren't.
- I know, right?

162
00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.890
We all told her to get married
but she didn't wanna listen.

163
00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:00.310
He'd been married three times before,
so she let it ride...

164
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:04.310
...and then she came home one night
and he had locked her out.

165
00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.350
She didn't even have anywhere to live.

166
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:10.020
Such a shame. After 10 years.

167
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:11.900
She was a smart girl...

168
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.190
...till she fell in love.

169
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:24.580
I'm thinking...

170
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.540
...I'm going to sell my apartment...

171
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:30.750
...and put the money towards
heaven on 5th.

172
00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.920
Why? You love your apartment.

173
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:37.090
I know, but there's plenty of room
in the new place and...

174
00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:40.680
And besides, I...

175
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.430
I want to make us a life there.

176
00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.770
You know, I... I want it to be ours.

177
00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.100
It is ours. I bought it for us.

178
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:54.110
And that's so amazing,
but you bought it.

179
00:10:54.940 --> 00:11:00.110
So really it's your place
and if anything were to happen...

180
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.660
What's going to happen?

181
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:06.620
Come on, I have to be smart here.
We're not married, I'd have no legal rights...

182
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:11.040
...you know, to...
To this home that I built...

183
00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.960
...with you.

184
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:17.970
Did you wanna get married?

185
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.810
Well, I didn't...
I didn't think that was an option.

186
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:26.560
What if it was an option?

187
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.480
Why? What, do you wanna get married?

188
00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:33.860
I wouldn't mind being married to you.

189
00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.480
Would you mind being married to me?

190
00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:41.110
No. No, not if...
Not if that's what you wanted.

191
00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.830
I mean, is...? Is that what you want?

192
00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:49.830
I want you.

193
00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.250
So...

194
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.670
...okay.

195
00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.340
So...?

196
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:59.800
- Really? We're...? We're getting married?
- We're getting married.

197
00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:03.430
- Should we get you a diamond?
- No, no.

198
00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:06.640
Just get me a really big closet.

199
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:12.940
So the other night Big and I
were talking about...

200
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:18.110
...you know,
moving in together and our future...

201
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.110
...and, you know, what makes sense
as we move forward and...

202
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:24.740
...well...

203
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.790
...we decided to get married.

204
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.710
- And I'm deaf.
- I'm so excited!

205
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:35.380
- Everybody is looking.
- Sorry!

206
00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.550
I'm so sorry, everyone...

207
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:40.880
...but this is my friend
and she just got engaged.

208
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:46.220
And she has been going out
with the man for 10 years.

209
00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.730
I'm mortified.

210
00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:54.980
There is literally a ringing in my ear.

211
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.050
And the big news
was about to go bicoastal.

212
00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:59.070
Samantha Jones.

213
00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:03.360
Well, I made a little decision
I hope you'll be happy about.

214
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:08.370
- Oh, honey, you finally got Botox.
- No, I did not get Botox.

215
00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:12.040
- I'm telling you, Carrie, you're gonna love it.
- I did not call...

216
00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:14.870
...to talk about Botox.
- Well, I'm just saying.

217
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.250
So last week...

218
00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.800
...after the auction,
I started thinking about my options.

219
00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.090
- Right.
- And, um...

220
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:29.100
Well, Big and I decided to get married.

221
00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.140
- Really?
- Yeah.

222
00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.230
Well, that's great.

223
00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:38.770
You sounded more excited
about the Botox.

224
00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:42.280
Honey, I am excited for you,
but you know me.

225
00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.450
I don't really believe in marriage.

226
00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:48.280
Now, Botox, on the other hand,
that works every time.

227
00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:50.370
Honey, I... I gotta go.

228
00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.950
We can catch up
when I'm in town next week.

229
00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:07.050
Hello.

230
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.300
I think I was in shock.

231
00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.100
I mean, it's you getting married.

232
00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:14.480
This is not some random person, it's you.

233
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.690
Yeah, I hear you.

234
00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:19.480
I thought that after that big mess with
Aidan, you'd never wanna get married.

235
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.820
So I put you in my
"we're never getting married" file.

236
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:26.150
Now I'm gonna have to
take you out of that file.

237
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.320
Well, I'm sorry about
all the extra paperwork.

238
00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:31.530
You'll get my bill.

239
00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:34.660
Samantha, it just feels
so different this time.

240
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:39.630
You know, there's no clichÃ©d
romantic kneeling on one knee.

241
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:41.380
It's just...

242
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:46.300
...two grownups making a decision
about spending their lives together.

243
00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:49.510
Well, I'm happy for you.

244
00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:51.550
Oh, and Hey, one more thing.

245
00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:56.100
I want you to be maid of honor.

246
00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.520
- How do you feel about that?
- The same way you feel about Botox:

247
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:01.440
Painful and unnecessary.

248
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:06.690
- Seventy-four, 75, 76. Seventy-six guests.
- Seventy-five sounds better.

249
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:10.360
A small wedding of 75 guests.

250
00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:13.620
Seventy-six trombones, yes.
Seventy-six guests, no.

251
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:15.790
As a wedding gift,
Charlotte had given me...

252
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:18.580
...Anthony Marantino,
friend and wedding planner.

253
00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:20.370
All right.

254
00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.710
Well, that's...

255
00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:25.880
Cutthroat. I love it.
I hope you're this decisive...

256
00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:28.970
...when it comes to location and the dress.
- I found the dress.

257
00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:31.550
- What? When?
- Yeah, the other day. I have it.

258
00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.230
- This is gonna be good.
- I am so excited.

259
00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:39.230
Okay.

260
00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.600
Here it is.

261
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:48.400
That was the exact reaction
I was aiming for.

262
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:52.070
It's pretty, but it's... It's so simple.

263
00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.120
It's simple and classic.

264
00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:59.410
When I saw it, I thought'
"That is what I should marry Big in."

265
00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:03.880
- Well, who's it by? What's the label?
- No one. I found it at a vintage shop.

266
00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.590
The bride wore a dress by no one.

267
00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.340
Oh, come on,
you know I'm gonna merchandise it up...

268
00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:12.930
...style it up with some shoes.
Right.

269
00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.100
The invitation is fancier than the dress.

270
00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:18.220
- I heard that.
- I meant you to.

271
00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.810
Don't tell anyone.

272
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:33.870
"The ultimate single gal, Carrie
Bradshaw, will be married in Manolos...

273
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:38.620
...to New York financier
John James Preston come fall."

274
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.960
- Our wedding's on Page Six.
- Who would put that in there?

275
00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:47.420
"Proving to single gals everywhere
that there can be a happy ending over 40."

276
00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.340
- Carrie.
- Congratulations.

277
00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:55.010
It seemed everywhere I went,
people had seen Page Six.

278
00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:59.140
Even people you didn't expect,
like my Vogue editor, Enid.

279
00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.890
We're putting together
our annual age issue...

280
00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.560
...and we'd like you to do 40.

281
00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:05.980
- Great. Who am I interviewing?
- No.

282
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.270
You. You are 40.

283
00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:12.150
I want you to be featured in the magazine
as the 40-year-old...

284
00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.990
And here's the brilliant twist.
- Bride.

285
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:20.290
Wait, I'm... I would be in the magazine?

286
00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:23.920
In bridal couture.
It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity...

287
00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:29.210
...so spare me a week of
faux soul-searching and just say yes.

288
00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:32.800
Enid, I am so very flattered,
but honestly, I...

289
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:34.680
Carrie, Vogue designers.

290
00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.510
Vogue photographers.

291
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.350
Vogue airbrushing.

292
00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.850
Nod your head. Yes.

293
00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:47.020
Thank you. It will be a sensation.

294
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:49.650
We're calling it "The Last Single Girl."

295
00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:53.860
Well, I'm hardly the last single girl.

296
00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:58.200
No, but 40 is the last age a woman
can be photographed in a wedding gown...

297
00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:01.290
...without the unintended
Diane Arbus subtext.

298
00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:04.960
I thought the issue was
"Great Style at Every Age."

299
00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.210
Style, yes. Bride, no.

300
00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.220
- Is that better?
- Just your typical Wednesday.

301
00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.890
Hanging out with old friends
like Stanford Blatch...

302
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:21.390
...and new friends like Vera Wang.

303
00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:25.180
She's looking at home for someone
who didn't think she had the bride gene.

304
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:28.060
- Well, I guess with the right man...
- And the right dress.

305
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:32.070
When I get married, I'm wearing
something like that, only bigger.

306
00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.860
Beauty. Hot.

307
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.900
Love the veil.

308
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:39.410
And Carolina Herrera.

309
00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.410
Nothing fancy, but it's beautiful.
Good work.

310
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:45.710
Great, let's do it.

311
00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:59.090
And Christian Lacroix.

312
00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:09.900
And Lanvin.

313
00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:15.900
And Dior.

314
00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.200
And Oscar de la Renta.

315
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:35.420
And finally, Vivienne Westwood.

316
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.920
A dress so special...

317
00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:43.100
...it could bring a wedding tear from
even the most unbelieving of women.

318
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:53.480
And then, the impossible happened.

319
00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.130
And just like that...

320
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:25.350
...Vivienne Westwood
kicked my sweet little suit's ass.

321
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.150
Can I lean?

322
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.330
Are you the last person in New York
still taking out library books?

323
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:48.790
I love the smell.

324
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:55.670
Oh. That's an oldie.

325
00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.550
"Love Letters of Great Men,
Volume One."

326
00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:00.800
- Oh, am I in there?
- No, no.

327
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:05.090
But some of your classmates are'
like Voltaire, Napoleon.

328
00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:10.350
- Young lady, you need to get glasses.
- No, I don't. I have yours.

329
00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.730
Okay, here's Napoleon.

330
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:16.860
"My dearest Josephine,
I wake consumed with thoughts of you."

331
00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.230
Typical short guy.
Gives it all away upfront.

332
00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:23.530
- Why are you reading this?
- It's research for my new book.

333
00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:27.280
- Oh. What's it about?
- Love.

334
00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:29.080
I used to write about finding love.

335
00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.660
Now I wanna write about
what happens after you've found it.

336
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:34.580
Interesting.

337
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:38.000
- What happens?
- Mm. Stay tuned.

338
00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:40.920
Oh, here, listen. It's Beethoven.

339
00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:43.470
Bring it, Ludwig.

340
00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:48.600
"My thoughts go out to you'
my immortal beloved.

341
00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.560
I can live only wholly with you
or not at all."

342
00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:54.060
Good stuff.

343
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.600
"Be calm my life, my all.

344
00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:59.610
Only by calm consideration
of our existence...

345
00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:02.570
...can we achieve
our purpose to live together.

346
00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:05.150
Oh, continue to love me.
Never misjudge...

347
00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:08.280
...the most faithful heart of your beloved.

348
00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:13.580
Ever thine. Ever mine. Ever ours."

349
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.920
Have you ever written me a love letter?

350
00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:21.550
Does a love fax count?

351
00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:26.590
- When have I ever gotten a love fax?
- Oh, I'm sure my secretary sent you one...

352
00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.100
...at some point.
- Yeah.

353
00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.640
What can I tell you, baby?
It's not my style.

354
00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:36.190
Besides, those guys had to write.
They were separated from their loves...

355
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:40.020
...by wars
and hundreds and hundreds of miles.

356
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:42.320
I'm right here.

357
00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.440
Hello.

358
00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:49.990
- You make me very happy.
- Yeah, yeah. Put it in writing.

359
00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:55.830
With my mind prenuptially preoccupied,
I became delinquent with my library books.

360
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.790
So now the tragic love stories
ofWuthering Heights and Love Story...

361
00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.090
...were going to cost me
more than a few tears.

362
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.260
Excuse me, which way is the wedding?

363
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:06.380
Up the stairs.

364
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:19.480
It was perfect.

365
00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.690
Big and I would be married
in the classic New York landmark...

366
00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:26.610
...that housed all the great love stories.

367
00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.570
Where is the waiter with the check?

368
00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:35.370
Jeez, Miranda, relax.
Magda hasn't even finished yet.

369
00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:38.160
I still have a brief to work on
when I get home.

370
00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:41.880
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- I'll take him.

371
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.130
Thank you, Magda.

372
00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:47.840
We're gonna wash that beautiful face.
Come, darling.

373
00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.220
What?

374
00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:53.890
We can't let the hard-working nanny
finish her supper?

375
00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:57.680
I'm sorry, I'm exhausted.
Brady woke me up at 5 a.m.

376
00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:00.900
- Hey, he woke me up too.
- Yeah.

377
00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.860
We gotta stop letting Brady
come into our bed.

378
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.070
You got milk on your top lip.

379
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:13.030
What now?

380
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.490
- It's like you're always criticizing me.
- I am not.

381
00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:21.580
You wanna go through life with foam
on your lip and no one ever telling you?

382
00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:31.430
Anything you wanna tell me?

383
00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:41.390
Hm. Is there anything you wanna tell me?

384
00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:52.530
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Wait. Wait. Don't come already.

385
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:56.280
- Yeah.
- No, wait. Get on top.

386
00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:59.080
Let's just get it over with.

387
00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:06.710
I mean, we gotta get up
in four and a half hours.

388
00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.380
We never have sex
and you wanna get it over with?

389
00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:20.470
- Steve, we have sex.
- When was the last time we had sex?

390
00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.230
Um...

391
00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.820
There was snow on the ground.

392
00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.990
- How often do you guys have sex?
- Sex.

393
00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.990
- Miranda, please.
What?

394
00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:42.580
She's 3.
She doesn't know what it means.

395
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:44.750
I'm 41 and I still don't know
what it means.

396
00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.170
I know, but she is repeating everything.

397
00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:51.510
If I'd known the girl talk was gonna be on
lockdown, I wouldn't have flown 3000 miles.

398
00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:54.300
No, we can talk.
Let's just not use that word.

399
00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:58.470
Fine. How often do you guys...?

400
00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.350
- Color?
Thank you.

401
00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:04.850
Well, I can't color enough.
I could color all day every day.

402
00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:09.110
If I had my way,
I would use every crayon in my box.

403
00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:12.530
We get it. You love to color.

404
00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:14.450
Why are you asking?

405
00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:19.830
Well, last night Steve and I were coloring,
and I was just about to...

406
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:22.750
Come.
I'm sorry, there's no crayon equivalent.

407
00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:26.460
And he wanted to switch positions
and I said:

408
00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.040
"Let's just get it over with."

409
00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:34.220
- He kept trying to make it last longer.
- This is bad?

410
00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.220
- It is when you have a full-time job.
- I have a full-time job.

411
00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:40.220
You don't also have a 5-year-old,
play dates, PTA meetings...

412
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:43.850
...and a mother-in-law in a rest home
with advancing Alzheimer's.

413
00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:47.230
We're just going through
a no-coloring phase.

414
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.190
- It comes and goes, right?
Every couple is different.

415
00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:53.070
Harry and I make love
two, three times a week.

416
00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.490
- Great, now I feel worse.
- Well, when was the last time for you?

417
00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:00.570
- Six months ago.
- Oh, my.

418
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:03.870
It sounds long.

419
00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.000
- But... But that's a dry spell.
- I bet it is.

420
00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:10.580
Hey, Carrie. What about you and Big?

421
00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.090
Come on. I told. Tell.

422
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:17.590
But I will tell you this.

423
00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.550
When Big colors...

424
00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:24.520
...he rarely stays inside the lines.

425
00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:27.180
Well, this has been very helpful.

426
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:38.780
John?

427
00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.830
- Hey.
- Come here.

428
00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:58.800
Totally outside the lines.

429
00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:10.140
Well, send it to Smith Jerrod
at the office address.

430
00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.940
I gotta go. Something just came up.

431
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:18.940
- I got a gift for you.
- So far, I like it.

432
00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:28.750
How'd...?

433
00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:32.460
Wait. That was you on the phone
at the auction.

434
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:36.750
- I knew how much you wanted it.
- But I was gonna buy it for myself.

435
00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:39.010
Well, I wanted to give it to you.

436
00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.010
For our anniversary.

437
00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:44.180
We met five years ago today.

438
00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.010
Right.

439
00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:49.430
Do you like it?

440
00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.520
Well, just to be clear,
this is a ring with diamonds...

441
00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:55.440
...it's not a diamond ring, right?
- Yeah.

442
00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:58.730
Well, in that case, I love it.

443
00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:02.280
It's my second favorite thing
I've ever found in there.

444
00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:08.700
Now, my gift is a little bit more oral.

445
00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:15.040
- Babe, I have to go to bed.
- Bed? It's 7:30.

446
00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:18.880
I have to be at the studio by 6 a.m.
And I need to get a workout in before that.

447
00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:20.710
You see, this is how it starts.

448
00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:25.220
Next thing you know, we're only
having sex three or four times a week.

449
00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:59.210
And that is how Samantha learned
she had a new neighbor.

450
00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:03.010
From then on, night after night...

451
00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:05.760
...while Smith got his beauty sleep...

452
00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:12.430
...Samantha found something
more interesting to watch than TiVo.

453
00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:19.440
- Keep going.
- Okay.

454
00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.610
- Keep them closed.
- Okay.

455
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:27.450
Okay. Open them.

456
00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:31.790
Double doors.

457
00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:34.410
So far, so good.

458
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.930
Oh, my God.

459
00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:54.930
- Oh, you did me proud, mister.
- You like it?

460
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:57.390
"Like it?"

461
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:04.400
It's love at first sight.

462
00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:06.780
Oh, my.

463
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:10.160
Here. Wait.

464
00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:11.870
Hold this.

465
00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:22.500
Now I believe this is all really happening.

466
00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:25.510
I can't believe it sold so fast.

467
00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:28.550
- It's a sign.
- Yeah, it's a sign I priced it too low.

468
00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:33.350
Hey, that's the food. Will you buzz
them in? And money's on the table.

469
00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.850
I'm gonna get started on the closet.
I should be done in about 17 years.

470
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.310
All right. Pink Post-it: Take.

471
00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:43.770
Purple: Toss. Yellow: Storage.

472
00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.360
Oh, you're very good friends.

473
00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.080
Oh, my God.

474
00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:59.870
I can't believe it.
Lily, look who it is. Aunt Samantha.

475
00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:05.880
- What are you doing here?
- A lot of shit went down in this place.

476
00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:08.590
Attention must be paid.

477
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:14.890
Really, champagne.

478
00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:23.900
- Remember this?
- Oh, yeah.

479
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:27.360
While Samantha put on
The Best of the '80s...

480
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.700
...I put on the worst.

481
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:40.500
Banana clip.

482
00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:46.050
Yeah.

483
00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:48.260
Work it.

484
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:52.010
Madonna.

485
00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:55.390
Whoo, whoo!

486
00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:05.440
No fun.

487
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:26.580
It took four friends three days...

488
00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:30.830
...to put 20 years into 38 boxes.

489
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:55.870
While I run over
to see your mother tomorrow...

490
00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:59.000
...maybe you could take Brady
by the first birthday party alone.

491
00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:03.840
And then I'll meet you at the twins, party,
and you can leave and be at the bar by 6.

492
00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.180
What's the matter?

493
00:34:08.390 --> 00:34:10.850
I had sex with someone else.

494
00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:16.600
And you're so amazing...

495
00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:20.020
...and I don't know how
I could do that to you.

496
00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:23.900
You and I hadn't had sex
in a really long time and I...

497
00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:25.400
God.

498
00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:28.490
It didn't mean anything.
It just happened once.

499
00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:30.370
And it's been killing me.

500
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:34.200
It's killing you?

501
00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:35.620
It just happened.

502
00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:39.080
I... I...

503
00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:41.090
I... I... I wasn't thinking.

504
00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:44.050
Do not follow me.

505
00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:57.390
Scout, off.

506
00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:08.070
Miranda, it's still me.

507
00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:13.160
Is it?

508
00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:29.680
Steve. I just... I can't believe it.

509
00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.300
- That's what I said.
Yes, it's sad.

510
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:35.560
But I'm not gonna make it any sadder
by staying at a bad hotel...

511
00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:38.600
...while I look for a place.
Could you pass the salt?

512
00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:41.190
Plus, I have to be downtown
and close to Brooklyn.

513
00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:44.190
We're gonna keep Brady's life
as normal as we possibly can.

514
00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:47.360
I'm gonna have him on my days
and Steve will have him on his...

515
00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:50.280
...and Magda will shuttle
back and forth between.

516
00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:53.450
Well, I don't really know
if this question is allowed...

517
00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:55.290
...but how is Steve handling this?

518
00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:58.370
Says he's devastated,
begs me to forgive him.

519
00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:01.170
It's not gonna happen.
I can barely even look at him.

520
00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:03.460
Miranda, honey'
are you sure you wanna do this?

521
00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.380
It's just one time.
Anyone can have a slip.

522
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:10.630
Even if I could get my mind around that
justification, it's the cheating part.

523
00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:14.970
The behind-my-back part, the violation
of the trust. That's what's killing me.

524
00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:26.610
Thank you for being you.

525
00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:33.370
Charlotte made love to Harry
four times that week.

526
00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:36.870
Okay. Wedding crunch time.
We need to get really serious here.

527
00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:41.000
Okay, not now.
I just got an e-mail from our contractor.

528
00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:43.790
He's pushed the move-in date yet again.

529
00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:45.880
- I gotta write this guy and...
- No, No, no.

530
00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:49.840
No. Wedding before contractor, all right?

531
00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:54.720
Unless you're planning to invite him'
which would make the guest list 201.

532
00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:59.470
Two hundred?
Jesus, Carrie, it went up again?

533
00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:02.640
- It's the dress.
- You said 75 people.

534
00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:06.560
How can I explain this?

535
00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.940
Look...

536
00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.360
...you play poker, right?

537
00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:14.610
Well, the dress upped the ante.

538
00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:18.160
Hey.

539
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:22.870
How you doing on your vows?

540
00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:27.710
A reminder. You'll be saying these in front
of a lot of people, so the pressure is on.

541
00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.800
All right, up. I have to finish this. Up.

542
00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.630
- Hey.
- I don't have time for this.

543
00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:36.260
- You're not taking it seriously.
- No, no, I'm not. It is a circus.

544
00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:42.810
Two hundred people?

545
00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:45.230
Page Six?

546
00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:53.490
This is my third marriage.
How do you think that makes me look?

547
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.080
I didn't know that was even an issue.

548
00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.130
So why didn't you say anything sooner?

549
00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:16.760
- You wanted all of this.
- Well, yeah.

550
00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:19.510
- But don't you want...?
- I want you.

551
00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:21.310
That's what I want.

552
00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:25.890
I could have just gone down to city hall.

553
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:48.540
I think it's too late for city hall now.

554
00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:52.710
Well, No, I wasn't suggesting that...

555
00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.210
I was just saying.

556
00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:59.970
See, that's the face...

557
00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:03.220
...I've been trying to avoid.

558
00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:05.810
Come here.

559
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:15.070
You're a great man-friend.

560
00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:23.240
And soon,
it was the night before the big day.

561
00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:27.460
There they are.

562
00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.600
Now, I know it's tradition
at the rehearsal dinner...

563
00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:53.570
...for the maid of honor to reveal
embarrassing things about the bride.

564
00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:58.610
But in our group, we never kiss and tell.

565
00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:03.910
- So I'd like to make a toast to the groom.
- There's a word he's heard before.

566
00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:10.250
- Who's that guy again?
- Karl. He's a partner at the firm.

567
00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:11.460
Karl's kind of a jerk.

568
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:13.670
You know what they say,
three time's a charm.

569
00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:16.090
Hey, dickwad, I'm speaking.

570
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:21.430
- Yeah, Samantha.
- Yeah.

571
00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:28.180
Now, there were times when we had
our doubts about this gorgeous man.

572
00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:32.810
But after careful observation
over the last hundred years...

573
00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:35.150
...my doubts are over.

574
00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:38.320
So here's to the groom...

575
00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:41.820
...a man who finally got "Carrie-d" away.

576
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:44.030
Aww.

577
00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.490
Here's hoping, John.

578
00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:47.910
That guy is a jackass. Here.

579
00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:50.000
- Cheers.
- That was really nice. Thank you.

580
00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:52.290
There's nothing like
an illegal Cuban cigar...

581
00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:55.000
...after dinner, huh?
Exactly.

582
00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:57.300
So that was quite a toast, Samantha.

583
00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:58.710
Well, you're quite a guy.

584
00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.670
Oh, my God, there's a cab.
Oh, yeah.

585
00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:02.840
- Hey, buddy, hold on.
- Get it.

586
00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:05.890
Steve.

587
00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:10.310
- I don't wanna bother you all.
- You're not bothering us.

588
00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:13.390
But...

589
00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:16.690
...I need to talk to Miranda.

590
00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.820
Samantha, could you ask her
to come out?

591
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:22.280
I don't wanna go in. It's a party and all.

592
00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.570
Sure.

593
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:32.290
Hey. I haven't talked to you all night.

594
00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:34.040
Steve's here.

595
00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:40.590
They, re not poodles.
You know what I mean.

596
00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:45.010
Hey, guys. Would you give us...?

597
00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:47.720
Yeah, sure, going in.

598
00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:52.730
You're all right?

599
00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:04.360
You didn't leave me any choice.
You won't return my calls.

600
00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:07.570
You only talk to me in front of the baby
and I can't say anything.

601
00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:11.120
What could you possibly have to say
that could make it any better?

602
00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:16.710
- Please. It was just that one time.
- You broke us!

603
00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:19.790
You broke us. What we had is broken.

604
00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:23.130
What the fuck is happening?

605
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:33.100
I changed who I was for you.

606
00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:41.230
Hey.

607
00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:45.280
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not all right.

608
00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:50.700
You two are crazy to get married.
Marriage ruins everything.

609
00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:06.260
Hey. There you are.
I thought you'd skipped out on me.

610
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:07.550
No.

611
00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:10.600
Well, the all-gal sleepover's
about to commence.

612
00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:19.100
Hey, is everything okay?

613
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:21.810
Yeah. I'm just tired, I guess.

614
00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:24.320
All right. Well, go home and go to sleep.

615
00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:27.360
But first give me a kiss good night
and make it a good one...

616
00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:31.990
...because it's the last single-girl kiss.

617
00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:38.500
- I always knew she would marry Big.
- Oh, you did not.

618
00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:41.000
- That's crazy.
- Yes, I did.

619
00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:45.510
After every breakup I secretly thought'
"Nope. They belong together."

620
00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:47.630
You thought that
after the second breakup?

621
00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:49.510
- Yup.
- After the fifteenth?

622
00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:52.640
Ha-ha. That's hilarious.
We broke up a lot.

623
00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:56.350
Yeah, but after the breakups
comes the hot make-up sex.

624
00:43:59.390 --> 00:44:02.860
Hey, you wanna get that? Open up.

625
00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:05.610
- Now say something.
- Sex.

626
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:12.410
Are you sure she's not my child?

627
00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.240
- Hello?
- It's me.

628
00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:17.830
Oh, my God, did you just hear Lily?

629
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.750
- I need to talk.
- What?

630
00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:26.590
I'm sitting here
trying to write these vows and...

631
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:30.050
Is this something we really wanna do?

632
00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:34.800
Hey, you know what? You guys, it's Big.
I'm gonna... I'm gonna take it.

633
00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:38.930
Get some sleep, groomie.

634
00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:45.900
- What's the matter?
- It's just...

635
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:49.490
...everything is great as it is.

636
00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:53.240
- I don't wanna screw it up.
- You won't.

637
00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:55.700
I screwed it up twice before.

638
00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:58.660
Here's the thing.

639
00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:04.540
This is me you're marrying tomorrow.
Me. It's nobody else.

640
00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:08.670
- Yeah?
- And I'm marrying you.

641
00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:10.380
It's me and you.

642
00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:13.720
And do you wanna hear
the great news there?

643
00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:14.930
Yeah.

644
00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:17.930
We've both already done
everything we can to screw it up.

645
00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:23.270
- Is that a smile I'm hearing?
- Yeah.

646
00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:27.900
It sounds to me like you've got
a bit of writer's block on the vow front.

647
00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:29.190
Yeah.

648
00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:32.240
And I find, you know'
as a professional writer...

649
00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:36.280
...that it's best to just, you know...

650
00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:40.120
...just stop thinking about it so much
and go to bed.

651
00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:42.330
And in the morning...

652
00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:45.750
- You'll know what to do.
- Exactly.

653
00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:49.050
And if not, then just write this:

654
00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:50.840
I will love you.

655
00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:53.130
Simple, to the point...

656
00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:57.600
...and I swear I won't even
try to take credit for it.

657
00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:02.020
So you're gonna go to bed now, right?

658
00:46:02.810 --> 00:46:06.400
Okay. Good night.

659
00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:09.650
I'll see you tomorrow. And hey...

660
00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:12.940
...it's me and you.

661
00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:48.600
Now, there's a bride.

662
00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:57.180
Before we leave, we're gonna
pick up our flowers, right, girls?

663
00:46:58.370 --> 00:47:01.240
Miranda, you're gonna have the dahlias.
Samantha, you have the roses.

664
00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:05.080
- And Charlotte...
We can take care of it.

665
00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:08.000
Hello?

666
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:11.540
Could you put Carrie
on the phone, please?

667
00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:14.380
Hello?

668
00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:23.100
Who let the dogs out?
Get these dogs out of here!

669
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:26.930
That's all we need is the lift of a leg
on the train of a dress.

670
00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:29.480
Could you open this door, please?

671
00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:32.520
- Wait, wait, hold it.
I'm trying to find out...

672
00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:33.980
- Oh, my God.
Hey.

673
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:36.360
- The girls are in this car.
- All of us together?

674
00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:39.490
All of you together.
Okay? Come on, lift it up. Let's go.

675
00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:41.530
Hey, it's Carrie. Leave me a message.

676
00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:45.700
- See you then. Bye-bye.
Just so beautiful.

677
00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:51.540
Blue.
Yes, sir.

678
00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:55.000
- Red and black.
Okay, I'll see you there.

679
00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:57.260
- Where's black?
- Oh, I'm coming, I'm coming.

680
00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:59.380
- You're following the red.
- I'm coming.

681
00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:02.010
Okay. Come on. Let's go.

682
00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:04.350
- Ready?
- Yeah, okay, you're in.

683
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:05.720
Okay.

684
00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:09.980
There's the bride. Look, she's dressed
like a princess, do you see?

685
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:12.230
- Can you hold that?
- Oh, yes.

686
00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.810
Thank you. Okay.

687
00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:16.440
Come on, scootch over.

688
00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:21.950
It's like pushing a cream puff
through a keyhole.

689
00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:23.320
See you at the library.

690
00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:26.950
- Hey, it's Carrie. Leave me a message.
- Why haven't you called me back?

691
00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:30.790
Look, I really need to talk to you.
Call me as soon as you get this.

692
00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:36.300
No more wedding guests on these stairs,
understand? Bridal party only.

693
00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:37.710
Got it.

694
00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:41.550
We've got a problem. They're not here.

695
00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:44.510
- Thy, re probably stuck in traffic.
- Both of them?

696
00:48:50.810 --> 00:48:55.770
- Hey, it's Carrie. Leave me a message.
- I can't go in without you.

697
00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:58.980
Baby...

698
00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:05.410
...this whole bride-and-groom thing
has really got me thrown.

699
00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.870
I need to know that it's still us.

700
00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:17.040
Just you and me. Like you said.

701
00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:24.140
I was putting it on.
I know.

702
00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:25.680
Good job. Beautiful.

703
00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:30.270
Come on, baby.
Turn around, let me see you.

704
00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:35.650
You look so beautiful.

705
00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:45.950
It looks beautiful.

706
00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:47.990
It really does. It looks so beautiful.

707
00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:50.540
Oh, look at Mommy, here they come.

708
00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:52.000
Easy does it.
We're here.

709
00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:55.250
The traffic was the worst.
57th Street was just...

710
00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:59.300
- It's okay.
Hello. You guys look great.

711
00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:05.380
- Okay, honey, let's go upstairs.
Ready. We're ready.

712
00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:08.680
He's not here.

713
00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:10.970
- Who's not here?
- The groom.

714
00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:12.770
What's happening?

715
00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:18.560
- Big's not here.
- But we're 25 minutes late.

716
00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:20.900
Well, did anybody call him?

717
00:50:24.110 --> 00:50:27.620
Well, give me a phone.
Somebody give me a phone.

718
00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:34.750
- All right, I don't know how to work this.
- Here, sweetie.

719
00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:36.460
Thank you.

720
00:50:47.050 --> 00:50:50.720
Hey, you know what?
Let me just look at your tie for a minute.

721
00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:52.770
Hello.
- Are you okay?

722
00:50:52.930 --> 00:50:54.310
I've been calling for an hour.

723
00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:57.980
- Why haven't you been answering?
- Because I don't know where my phone is.

724
00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:01.230
So, what's going on? Where are you?

725
00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:04.900
I was out front. I just left.

726
00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:10.200
I can't do this.

727
00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:17.210
Oh, my God.

728
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:23.920
Carrie? Carrie.

729
00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:31.180
- He's not coming. Oh, my God.
- What do you mean, "He's not coming"?

730
00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:36.020
Get me out of here.

731
00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:37.770
- Get me out of here!
- Go, go, go.

732
00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:41.060
- You take her, I'll take care of all of this.
All right, all right.

733
00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:42.650
Here we go.

734
00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:06.880
What the fuck am I doing?
Turn around, go back.

735
00:52:07.050 --> 00:52:08.590
It's a one-way street.

736
00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:11.390
By the time we go around the block'
she'll be gone.

737
00:52:11.550 --> 00:52:13.850
There's no one behind us. Turn around.

738
00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:24.570
- I think this is them.
- Pull over. Pull over.

739
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:27.570
Carrie.

740
00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:38.700
Carrie. I freaked out for a minute'
but I'm ready now.

741
00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:43.040
Oh, God.

742
00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:48.550
I knew
you would do this! I knew it!

743
00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:51.720
- Carrie, I'm sorry.
- I am humiliated!

744
00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:54.470
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry, Carrie.

745
00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:55.720
Come on. Come on.

746
00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:00.890
- Carrie, wait, I'm sorry. Carrie...
- No! No!

747
00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:03.900
Come on, we're gonna get in the car.

748
00:53:04.810 --> 00:53:07.150
It's all right, it's all right.

749
00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:30.510
Let's go, man. Move it.

750
00:53:59.450 --> 00:54:02.450
I thought I would still be in extreme pain.

751
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:07.630
I feel nothing.

752
00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:12.760
I'd like some more nothing.

753
00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:20.430
Yes, I'm still jilted.

754
00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:25.810
What the hell got into him?
He was perfectly fine at the dinner.

755
00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:29.360
I knew it when he called last night.

756
00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:32.820
- I could tell.
- Then why didn't you say anything?

757
00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:37.740
I didn't wanna believe it. I di...

758
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:41.160
I didn't even wanna say it out loud.

759
00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:46.790
- Now I have nowhere to live.
- You'll stay here.

760
00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:48.210
Forever.

761
00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:51.840
Maybe you should eat something.

762
00:54:53.010 --> 00:54:55.340
- Anyone? Hungry?
- No.

763
00:54:57.220 --> 00:55:00.390
I can never go back there again.
How am I gonna get my clothes?

764
00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:04.730
Oh, honey, I can hire people to do all that.
Anything you need.

765
00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:06.690
A hit man?

766
00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:11.520
I have nothing to wear
but a wedding gown.

767
00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:14.990
You have your honeymoon clothes here.

768
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:18.490
Well, there's the silver lining.

769
00:55:20.370 --> 00:55:24.540
A honeymoon
at a romantic Mexican resort...

770
00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:26.620
...that's prepaid on my credit card...

771
00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:29.250
...because I wanted to surprise
the man who jilted me.

772
00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:31.080
I can get you out of that.

773
00:55:31.250 --> 00:55:34.170
Worse comes to worse'
I'll say there was a death or something.

774
00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:36.050
Wasn't there?

775
00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:43.220
Keep those eyes closed.
Keep them closed.

776
00:55:57.700 --> 00:55:58.820
Charlotte.

777
00:55:58.990 --> 00:56:00.780
Come here. Come here.

778
00:56:03.830 --> 00:56:06.620
I did something really bad, I think.

779
00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:10.170
I said something to Big
at the rehearsal dinner.

780
00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:12.880
What do you mean?

781
00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:16.550
It was right after Steve showed up.
I was upset.

782
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:20.430
Big came over to me'
and I said something like:

783
00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:23.350
"You're crazy to get married."

784
00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:26.060
It just came out.

785
00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:30.190
- Do you think it's totally the reason?
- No.

786
00:56:30.350 --> 00:56:33.360
Big has been weird
about marriage for years.

787
00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:39.030
- I keep thinking I should tell Carrie.
- No, No, no.

788
00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:42.490
This is a bad time to even mention it.

789
00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:48.290
No, no, no. Find another time later.

790
00:56:48.450 --> 00:56:49.450
Uh-huh.

791
00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:53.580
Well, it turns out, I couldn't get her
out of the honeymoon, but I got us in.

792
00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:57.460
- What?
- I just booked us three seats on the flight.

793
00:56:57.630 --> 00:57:00.340
Mexico, here we come.

794
00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:03.550
I can't go to Mexico. I have a job.

795
00:57:11.770 --> 00:57:14.770
Jerrod. Smith Jerrod, with a J.

796
00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:18.820
That's right. Great, thank you.

797
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:24.110
- Make sure that the car is there...
- We're here, I'll call you back later.

798
00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:28.200
Welcome to Mexico.

799
00:57:33.830 --> 00:57:35.420
Do you have wi-fi? Thanks.

800
00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:42.380
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
I'm waiting for a Mr. And Mrs. Preston.

801
00:57:42.550 --> 00:57:46.720
Honey, you'll be waiting a long time.
We'll talk.

802
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:56.060
This will kill her.

803
00:57:58.020 --> 00:58:00.070
- Where is she?
- In the powder room.

804
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:02.990
- Well, let's look around.
- Yeah.

805
00:58:33.250 --> 00:58:35.760
And this is a master suite.

806
00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:39.090
Oh, my God.

807
00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:41.430
Here.

808
00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:43.430
You get that side.

809
00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:47.430
Where are we gonna put these?

810
00:58:48.350 --> 00:58:52.440
Here. No more honeymoon stuff.
This is very important.

811
00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:00.530
Here she comes.

812
00:59:13.790 --> 00:59:15.550
It's going to be a gorgeous sunset.

813
00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.010
Close the shutters.

814
00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:27.470
All of them.

815
00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:50.290
Morning.

816
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:54.170
Did I dream it?

817
01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:09.890
Carrie?

818
01:00:10.850 --> 01:00:13.480
It's dinnertime. You slept the whole day.

819
01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:16.230
So?

820
01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:33.710
Honey? You have to eat a little breakfast.

821
01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:36.880
I'm tired.

822
01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:40.500
Well, eat something,
then you can go back to sleep.

823
01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:17.460
- Oh, thank you, Paulo.
- Sure.

824
01:01:20.670 --> 01:01:25.550
With all this gorgeous fresh food, you're
gonna eat that pudding crap the entire trip?

825
01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:28.260
It's the only thing in the pantry
that's totally safe.

826
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:32.220
See? "Made in Poughkeepsie."
I didn't wanna chance it.

827
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:34.140
It's a five-star resort.

828
01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.520
It's Mexico.

829
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:46.240
Carrie.

830
01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:49.950
Is there coffee?

831
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:53.740
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

832
01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:03.250
The sun feels nice.

833
01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:09.220
Jesus, honey, wax much?

834
01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:12.560
What? I didn't know
I was gonna be wearing a bathing suit.

835
01:02:12.930 --> 01:02:15.680
- What are you talking about?
- I forgot to wax.

836
01:02:15.850 --> 01:02:19.650
- Since when, 1998?
I've had other things on my mind.

837
01:02:19.810 --> 01:02:22.400
I could be on death row
and not have that situation.

838
01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:25.650
Well, when you're married,
you have a different set of priorities.

839
01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:27.450
Oh, honey, don't blame marriage.

840
01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:30.490
This one's married and
she's not growing a national forest.

841
01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:34.540
How do you even cross your legs?
Let me make you a spa appointment.

842
01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:37.330
Any thicker,
and you won't be able to find it.

843
01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:41.630
So, what, it's my fault?

844
01:02:41.790 --> 01:02:44.920
I let the sex go out of my marriage.
I deserve what I got?

845
01:02:45.090 --> 01:02:48.800
- Thanks for understanding.
- Honey, I'm sorry. That's not what I...

846
01:02:48.970 --> 01:02:50.590
I'm fine.

847
01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:04.520
Hey, let's go down to the hotel
for dinner tonight.

848
01:03:04.690 --> 01:03:06.480
- Really?
- Yeah.

849
01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:09.360
I gotta do something
to pull me out of my "Mexi-coma."

850
01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:12.110
Oh, honey, you made a little joke.

851
01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:14.200
Good for you.

852
01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.200
Yeah.

853
01:03:32.550 --> 01:03:36.720
- My name is Felix, I'll be your server.
- Felix, we'll start with cuatro margaritas.

854
01:03:36.890 --> 01:03:39.100
Oh, No, I'm not drinking.
Just bottled water.

855
01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:41.520
- I'll drink hers.
- May I have your room numbers?

856
01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:46.900
We're staying in one of the private houses.
Uh, number 3.

857
01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:48.650
Very good, Mrs. Preston.

858
01:03:53.490 --> 01:03:55.160
That was like taking a bullet.

859
01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:03.170
Charlotte has pudding in her Prada.

860
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:11.970
- Will I ever laugh again?
- Yes.

861
01:04:12.130 --> 01:04:15.850
- When?
- When something is really, really funny.

862
01:04:18.810 --> 01:04:22.600
Thank God for that mariachi band
or I'd be able to hear my own thoughts.

863
01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:26.560
Fabulous. And keep them coming.

864
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:29.570
Thanks.

865
01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:36.740
Thank you.

866
01:04:42.790 --> 01:04:45.500
He couldn't get out of the car.

867
01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:49.420
After 10 years
of what he already put me through...

868
01:04:49.590 --> 01:04:53.760
...he couldn't make the effort
and get out of the car.

869
01:04:54.050 --> 01:04:55.890
I made the effort.

870
01:04:56.050 --> 01:04:57.850
I put a bird on my head.

871
01:04:58.010 --> 01:04:59.560
- Is that what that was?
- Yeah.

872
01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:02.270
- I thought it was feathers.
- It was a bird.

873
01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:05.770
- It was beautiful.
Beautiful.

874
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:08.310
He's a bad guy.

875
01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.570
Always was.

876
01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:15.650
- Bad guys do bad things.
- And good guys do bad things.

877
01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:18.740
The good guys screw you
and the bad guys screw you.

878
01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:20.990
The rest of them
don't know how to screw you.

879
01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:24.290
- Trust me, I've done the legwork.
After everything I know...

880
01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:28.830
...after 20 years of
everything we've learned...

881
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.920
...I threw it all away for the thrill of
putting his name on the honeymoon suite.

882
01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:36.680
If I met me now, I wouldn't know me.

883
01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:40.600
As long as we're going down this road...

884
01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:45.230
...I can't believe
that my life revolves around a man.

885
01:05:45.390 --> 01:05:47.730
On what planet
did I allow that to happen?

886
01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:48.980
But you love him.

887
01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:52.860
Does that mean saying his name
50 times more a day than I say my own?

888
01:05:53.570 --> 01:05:57.400
Does it mean worrying about him
and his needs before me and mine?

889
01:05:57.570 --> 01:05:59.950
Is it all about the other person?
Is that love?

890
01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:03.490
- No, that's marriage.
- Even this ring.

891
01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:05.160
I wanted to buy this for myself.

892
01:06:05.330 --> 01:06:07.580
That meant something to me'
to be able to do that.

893
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:11.380
- And then he buys it for me.
- Because he knew how much you loved it.

894
01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:15.460
Yes, but now every time I look down at it,
I see him not me.

895
01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:20.340
- Is every...?
- We'll take another round.

896
01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:23.680
- Another?
- Relax. We're on vacation.

897
01:06:23.850 --> 01:06:25.600
Technically, we're on my honeymoon.

898
01:06:25.770 --> 01:06:28.690
No, I think we're on their honeymoon.

899
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:32.610
Yeah, it's all so hot three days in.

900
01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:43.660
"Mailbox full." Yea, I'll bet it is.

901
01:06:43.830 --> 01:06:46.120
- There's no time like the present.
No.

902
01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:48.870
I'm not ready to face it all yet.

903
01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:52.840
Hey. I'm going for a run
and then to the gym for Pilates.

904
01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.050
Anybody wanna...?

905
01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:58.590
- Hi.
- Hey, good news.

906
01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.800
I got an e-mail
from your buyer's attorney.

907
01:07:00.970 --> 01:07:04.600
Thy, re willing to sell you back
your old apartment at the escalated price...

908
01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:07.600
...and "are willing to vacate
by the time you return...

909
01:07:07.770 --> 01:07:09.810
...pending an additional financial offer."

910
01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:13.650
Well, apparently you can go home again,
but it'll cost you.

911
01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:16.530
- Let's work on getting your things there.
Wow...

912
01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:19.610
...you two could rule the world.

913
01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:22.820
After her workout,
Charlotte couldn't help but think...

914
01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:24.910
...how truly blessed she was.

915
01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:28.790
This week had made her feel more grateful
than ever for her happy marriage.

916
01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:33.290
And just for a second, while picturing
her loved ones at home in New York...

917
01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:37.630
...she forgot where she was
and opened her mouth.

918
01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:01.070
Hello, miss.

919
01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:07.450
- Have you had that happen?
Not recently.

920
01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:09.330
Sweetie, what's...?

921
01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:11.410
It's locked, she's mopping.

922
01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:13.170
Try the...

923
01:08:22.050 --> 01:08:24.470
- Did you just...?
- Shut up, shut up, shut up!

924
01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:26.640
And just like that...

925
01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:28.850
...Charlotte "Poughkeepsied"
in her pants.

926
01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:34.600
Oh, my God.

927
01:08:38.110 --> 01:08:39.440
Miranda was right.

928
01:08:39.610 --> 01:08:44.490
When something was really,
really funny, I laughed.

929
01:08:45.530 --> 01:08:47.450
Oh, my God.

930
01:09:12.230 --> 01:09:13.600
First message:

931
01:09:13.770 --> 01:09:18.900
Received Saturday,
September 20th, 12:30 p.m.

932
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:22.480
Carrie, call me.
I need to talk to you before...

933
01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:18.370
There was no better time I could think of
to hire an assistant.

934
01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:22.000
Um, no. I do not lift boxes.

935
01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.260
Yeah, definitely, no.
I would love a career in fashion.

936
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:29.380
Oh.

937
01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:32.300
This is not nonfat.

938
01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:34.060
Oh.

939
01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:38.270
I love your books. Your shit's brilliant.

940
01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:40.020
Cathy?

941
01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:43.730
- You seem drunk.
- Little bit.

942
01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:45.730
Never made it to bed last night.

943
01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:48.280
But I type like a motherfucker!

944
01:10:48.450 --> 01:10:50.450
I have a degree in finance
from Princeton...

945
01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:53.280
...and I've been assistant to a V.P.
At Merrill Lynch.

946
01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:58.580
That's impressive. And, Paul'
why do you think you're right for this job?

947
01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:11.050
- So you're from St. Louis?
- That's right. Louise from St. Louis.

948
01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:13.140
And you have a degree
in computer science?

949
01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:16.310
- Yes, that's correct.
- Well, good for you. I can barely text.

950
01:11:18.350 --> 01:11:22.020
- Have you ever been a personal assistant?
- No, but I'm the oldest of six kids...

951
01:11:22.190 --> 01:11:24.400
...so I'm sure I can handle
anything you got.

952
01:11:24.570 --> 01:11:27.400
- Wow. Six kids, what's that like?
- Crowded.

953
01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:30.990
I had to move to New York just to
get some room. Where did I end up?

954
01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:33.780
In a one-bedroom apartment
with three roommates.

955
01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:37.450
Well, aside from the space issue'
why'd you move to New York?

956
01:11:39.370 --> 01:11:40.660
To fall in love.

957
01:11:42.210 --> 01:11:45.540
- What? That's corny, right?
- No.

958
01:11:45.710 --> 01:11:49.720
No, no, it's... It's just very honest.

959
01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:54.930
I don't think that I've heard
anybody say that in a very long time.

960
01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:56.810
Well...

961
01:11:58.730 --> 01:12:02.060
So Louise from St. Louis,
I just have one more question.

962
01:12:02.230 --> 01:12:03.270
Okay.

963
01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:05.810
How does an unemployed girl
with three roommates...

964
01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:08.530
...afford the Patchwork Denim Bowley
Louis Vuitton bag?

965
01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:13.280
It's rented. Bag Borrow or Steal?
It's like Netflix for purses.

966
01:12:13.450 --> 01:12:17.240
- How can I not know about this?
- Girl, stick with me. I'll hook you up.

967
01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:25.290
And did she hook me up.

968
01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:29.840
Hi. This is Louise.
I'm calling for Carrie Bradshaw.

969
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:34.550
Yes, she received your invitation,
but she will be unable to attend.

970
01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:36.350
Thank you.

971
01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:42.480
Put that over there.

972
01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.440
After only three days...

973
01:12:45.610 --> 01:12:50.280
...I began to think of her
as Saint Louise from St. Louis.

974
01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:53.200
Ain't nothing in there for you.

975
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:57.200
And as I moved back
into my old apartment...

976
01:12:57.370 --> 01:13:00.330
...Miranda searched for a new one,
downtown.

977
01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:03.460
You see the Chinese writing?
Yeah.

978
01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:06.880
New York magazine says this is
the new up-and-coming neighborhood.

979
01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:10.840
- Okay, maybe down that way?
- Maybe you come home.

980
01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:14.970
Look, white guy with a baby.

981
01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:18.800
Wherever he's going'
that's where we need to be.

982
01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:21.060
Come on.

983
01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:27.110
I lived here before.
Thia used to be all-Ukrainian area.

984
01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:28.980
A U-Haul.

985
01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:31.150
Coming or going?

986
01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:34.870
- Going. Oh, boy. I'm gonna check it out.
- Okay.

987
01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.280
Wait down here, okay?

988
01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:40.680
And there in old Ukrainia,
Miranda found her new apartment.

989
01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:43.550
- Hi. I'm interested in the apartment upstairs.
Yeah.

990
01:13:43.570 --> 01:13:45.580
"And there they remained
for the rest of their days...

991
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:47.590
...for the birds
were constantly on guard...

992
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:51.170
...and the women could not so much
as step one foot out the door.

993
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:56.140
And Cinderella and the prince
lived happily ever after."

994
01:14:02.690 --> 01:14:06.190
You know that this is just a fairy tale,
right, sweetheart?

995
01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:09.690
I mean, things don't always
happen like this in real life.

996
01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:14.660
- I just think you should know that now.
- Again.

997
01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:17.660
And another one bites the dust.

998
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:19.830
- Hi.
Hi.

999
01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:22.250
Mommy's home.

1000
01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:25.250
Thanks for watching Lily
while I went to the doctor.

1001
01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:29.550
- Oh, sure. Everything okay?
- Mm-hm.

1002
01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:34.130
- I'm pregnant.
- How?

1003
01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:38.970
You know how people always say
that when you stop trying, it can happen?

1004
01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:42.470
And my doctor says that she knows
other couples who have adopted...

1005
01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:44.810
...and then they get pregnant.

1006
01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:48.770
- Sweetie.
- Carrie, I'm pregnant.

1007
01:14:50.570 --> 01:14:54.450
I guess in certain houses,
fairy tales do come true.

1008
01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:58.990
Oh, that was really hot.

1009
01:15:00.370 --> 01:15:04.790
- You seem kind of distant.
- Distant? You're still in me.

1010
01:15:12.010 --> 01:15:16.550
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- When have I ever wanted to talk about it?

1011
01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:20.140
Okay. I'll talk about it.

1012
01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:22.640
Your best friends got screwed over
by their guys.

1013
01:15:22.810 --> 01:15:25.230
How could you not be distant?

1014
01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:29.230
It's more than that.

1015
01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:35.150
Lately, I haven't been feeling
a connection to...

1016
01:15:35.650 --> 01:15:37.490
- What, me?
- No.

1017
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:43.410
To it, here. I have no real connection
to our life here.

1018
01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:46.290
What life here? Seriously.

1019
01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:47.750
All I do is work...

1020
01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:50.330
...and you run off to New York
every chance you get.

1021
01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:54.760
Well, not every chance I get.
Only for the A-list things.

1022
01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:58.010
And my managing you, it's...
It's getting to be too much.

1023
01:15:58.180 --> 01:15:59.930
I'm starting to resent it.

1024
01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:02.680
For the last two years'
it's been all about you.

1025
01:16:02.850 --> 01:16:06.020
Well, for the first three years,
it was all about you.

1026
01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:09.310
I know. That was so much more fun.

1027
01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:13.230
Carrie Bradshaw's web page is a mess.

1028
01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:15.570
Interesting. So is Carrie Bradshaw.

1029
01:16:16.730 --> 01:16:21.320
Hey, when are we gonna get to the really
important stuff, like unpacking my closet?

1030
01:16:21.490 --> 01:16:24.410
One thing at a time. You ever gonna
answer any of these e-mails?

1031
01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:26.160
- Yes.
- When?

1032
01:16:27.370 --> 01:16:29.120
- Now?
- Okay.

1033
01:16:29.290 --> 01:16:32.830
- Well, I'll read and you tell me what to do.
- Okay.

1034
01:16:33.210 --> 01:16:37.590
Who's john@jjpny.com?

1035
01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:42.090
Oh, shit. That's him, right?

1036
01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:55.520
Delete.

1037
01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:01.320
And isn't there some cyberspace place
that you can send those...

1038
01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:04.910
...so that I never have to see
an e-mail from him ever again?

1039
01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:07.620
Do that, please.

1040
01:17:09.790 --> 01:17:12.290
You sure you wanna end
all communication with him?

1041
01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:20.420
Okay. Great.

1042
01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:24.800
I can't believe you're even dressing up.

1043
01:17:24.970 --> 01:17:28.470
All the parents in Brady's school
dress up. It's fun.

1044
01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:32.810
Fun thought up by a group of non-working
mothers with nothing else to do all day.

1045
01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:37.980
All right, what do they got?
Witch and sexy kitten.

1046
01:17:38.150 --> 01:17:42.490
That's it. The only two choices
for women, witch and sexy kitten.

1047
01:17:42.650 --> 01:17:44.780
You just said a mouthful there, sister.

1048
01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:49.160
Maybe I should wear this and
a briefcase, and go as myself.

1049
01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:52.330
I got an e-mail from Big.

1050
01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:54.670
"I don't know what to say."

1051
01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:59.800
- Uh, then don't send an e-mail.
- What were you expecting?

1052
01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:03.920
And in the subject box, two words:

1053
01:18:04.090 --> 01:18:07.340
- "I'm sorry."
- Ugh.

1054
01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:09.850
Steve is all about the "I'm sorry."

1055
01:18:10.010 --> 01:18:12.770
"I'm sorry" e-mails,
"I'm sorry" voice mails...

1056
01:18:12.930 --> 01:18:15.480
..."I'm sorry" flowers, "I'm sorry" cards.

1057
01:18:15.650 --> 01:18:19.560
How about, don't do anything
to be "I'm sorry" for?

1058
01:18:19.730 --> 01:18:22.110
Well, maybe he's sorry.

1059
01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:24.610
Well, maybe so is Big.

1060
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:26.200
Point taken.

1061
01:18:28.570 --> 01:18:30.080
Hey, you're scaring the women.

1062
01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:34.040
It's gonna take a little more than that
to scare me after what I've been through.

1063
01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:39.210
I still cannot believe this happened to me.
I mean, I... I know it happened.

1064
01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:44.550
But I just... I can't believe it happened.

1065
01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:51.720
I lay awake at night going over
every detail of that last week in my head.

1066
01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:57.980
Carrie, there's a detail about that last week
I've been meaning to tell you.

1067
01:18:58.150 --> 01:19:01.230
- At the rehearsal dinner...
- And then I saw it.

1068
01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:05.740
The only thing scary enough to scare me
after what I'd been through.

1069
01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:08.780
You look great.
You look amazing. So that's the worst of it.

1070
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:10.160
Wait, wait, wait.

1071
01:19:11.530 --> 01:19:13.580
What does it say there
in the editor's note?

1072
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:17.000
"The wedding of Carrie Bradshaw
and John James Preston was canceled...

1073
01:19:17.170 --> 01:19:20.380
...as this issue went to press.
Bradshaw is..."

1074
01:19:22.590 --> 01:19:24.800
Bradshaw is what?

1075
01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:27.260
Wait...

1076
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:33.510
"Bradshaw is still single
and living in New York City."

1077
01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:41.650
I didn't wanna buy it...

1078
01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:44.950
...but I figured it was
one less Vogue in New York.

1079
01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:08.690
Louise.

1080
01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:14.240
Oh, my Lord. I didn't even recognize you.

1081
01:20:14.410 --> 01:20:17.280
That's the point. My head's
in the Witness Protection Program.

1082
01:20:17.450 --> 01:20:19.540
I'm feeling that look on you though.

1083
01:20:19.710 --> 01:20:24.330
- And I am feeling that Chanel on you.
- Mine till Tuesday.

1084
01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:29.920
- All right, so...
- Here. Time to rejoin the world.

1085
01:20:30.090 --> 01:20:31.920
Already?

1086
01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:39.220
- Your new number, area code 347-85...
- Ho... Ho... Hold it.

1087
01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:41.140
347?

1088
01:20:41.310 --> 01:20:45.060
Oh, no. No, I'm a 917 gal,
always have been.

1089
01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:48.230
I tried. It's no longer available.

1090
01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:49.820
Now you're 347.

1091
01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:51.530
Samantha Jones.

1092
01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:54.950
Carrie Bradshaw. Or I used to be.

1093
01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:56.370
Talk to me.

1094
01:20:56.950 --> 01:21:00.750
I'm a 347 area code. How awful is that?

1095
01:21:00.910 --> 01:21:02.870
347 is the new New York.

1096
01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:07.130
Well, I want the old New York
with my old 917 and my old will to live.

1097
01:21:07.290 --> 01:21:11.050
Old New York, new New York.
Honey, at least it's New York.

1098
01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:14.380
Another hard thing about being in L. A:

1099
01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:16.760
My sex-on-a-stick next-door neighbor.

1100
01:21:16.930 --> 01:21:19.470
- I can't stop looking at him.
- Looking?

1101
01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:24.810
Just looking. After seeing Steve's face
at the rehearsal dinner, I could never...

1102
01:21:25.810 --> 01:21:28.810
Oh, but you should see this guy.
Every night...

1103
01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:31.650
...sex with a different partner. He's like...

1104
01:21:32.530 --> 01:21:36.990
...me five years ago.
- Yeah. When I was a 917.

1105
01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:40.240
I mean, what's the point
of having a hot guy next door...

1106
01:21:40.410 --> 01:21:43.000
...if you can't have sex with him?

1107
01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:47.000
We agreed that no one else from the show
but Smith was going to be on the cover.

1108
01:21:48.250 --> 01:21:50.340
Well, get back to me.

1109
01:21:55.930 --> 01:21:57.010
Hey.

1110
01:22:25.250 --> 01:22:28.710
And in an effort to stay out of the house
and out of trouble...

1111
01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:31.380
...Samantha went shopping.

1112
01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:35.880
Rescue a puppy today?

1113
01:22:43.890 --> 01:22:48.440
- She needs a good home. Interested?
- No.

1114
01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:52.520
And just as Samantha convinced herself
that the dog wasn't for her...

1115
01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:59.410
She's been fixed'
but she hasn't lost the urge.

1116
01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:11.580
And because Samantha
couldn't get off...

1117
01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:14.380
...she got things.

1118
01:23:26.730 --> 01:23:29.940
What would happen if these
were to magically disappear?

1119
01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:34.110
- Yeah, I know where you live.
- For a pair like this, I could move.

1120
01:23:34.610 --> 01:23:37.280
Wait, Carrie, not that one.

1121
01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:44.780
Do you want me to get rid of it?

1122
01:23:46.750 --> 01:23:48.370
No.

1123
01:23:49.250 --> 01:23:51.080
No, it's too beautiful.

1124
01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:54.460
I'll just...

1125
01:23:54.630 --> 01:23:57.500
...bury it deep in the back...

1126
01:23:57.670 --> 01:23:59.800
...like I did my feelings.

1127
01:24:01.010 --> 01:24:04.470
- Do you miss him?
- Every day.

1128
01:24:05.810 --> 01:24:07.850
It's weird...

1129
01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:11.310
...I haven't cried very much at all.

1130
01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:13.480
I don't know, maybe...

1131
01:24:14.190 --> 01:24:17.900
Maybe you're only allotted
a certain amount of tears per man...

1132
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:19.990
...and I used mine up.

1133
01:24:20.150 --> 01:24:22.490
Yeah, I know how you feel.

1134
01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:26.160
Because my St. Louis boyfriend
broke up with me last year...

1135
01:24:26.450 --> 01:24:28.240
...and I miss him all the time.

1136
01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:33.500
Suddenly, it dawned on me. There
were two broken hearts in my walk-in.

1137
01:24:36.750 --> 01:24:40.340
Louise, we need a cocktail.
Grab your rental.

1138
01:24:41.170 --> 01:24:43.840
And it threw me so hard.

1139
01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:47.010
Because, you know, I thought Will...

1140
01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:48.850
That's his name.

1141
01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:53.600
- I thought he was the love of my life.
- Well, what happened?

1142
01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:58.020
He said he loved me and all,
but he didn't think that I was the one.

1143
01:24:59.530 --> 01:25:04.360
That shit hurt. But, you know, whatever.

1144
01:25:04.530 --> 01:25:07.490
- I'm not gonna give up on love.
- Good.

1145
01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:09.990
Love is the thing, you know.

1146
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:13.830
You see that?

1147
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.880
That's love.
And I'm bringing it to me all day long.

1148
01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:22.380
Excuse me.

1149
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:31.060
Oh, I remember that smile.
Who's the guy?

1150
01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:34.390
Someone I just met.
He wants me to meet him for drinks.

1151
01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:37.560
At 11:30? Oh, that's a booty call.

1152
01:25:37.730 --> 01:25:41.320
No, it's not.
He's a waiter, he just got off work.

1153
01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:45.740
Louise. Now, I may not get texts,
I may not send texts, but trust me.

1154
01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:49.070
The subtext of that text? Booty.

1155
01:25:50.330 --> 01:25:53.330
But if he meets me,
then it's not a booty call, right?

1156
01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:59.170
All right, then. Enjoy yourself.

1157
01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:01.090
That's what your 20s are for.

1158
01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:04.050
Your 30s are to learn the lessons.

1159
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:06.800
Your 40s are to pay for the drinks.

1160
01:26:07.390 --> 01:26:11.100
Well, in that case, I'll take another one.

1161
01:26:12.890 --> 01:26:14.890
It's all about the desk.

1162
01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:18.100
If I find the desk, the writing will come.
And it better come...

1163
01:26:18.270 --> 01:26:22.320
...because I'm using my new book advance
to pay the fancy decorator.

1164
01:26:23.610 --> 01:26:28.450
I think it is so great that you're
redoing your entire apartment.

1165
01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:31.030
Yeah, well, out with the old and...

1166
01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:34.790
...oh, in with the overpriced.

1167
01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:42.630
Hey. Harry called me and
mentioned that you're not running.

1168
01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:47.170
- Why'd he do that?
- Because he loves you and he's concerned.

1169
01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:49.470
There's nothing to be concerned about.

1170
01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:54.390
Well, did...? Did the doctor say
that it's not safe or something?

1171
01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:58.310
No. She said because
I'm already a runner, it's fine.

1172
01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:01.060
So then, why are you not...?

1173
01:27:01.230 --> 01:27:03.480
Because I'm afraid
something bad is gonna happen.

1174
01:27:03.650 --> 01:27:07.490
- It's a miracle I'm even pregnant.
- Okay.

1175
01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:11.450
I have everything I ever wanted.

1176
01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:13.990
I am so happy that I'm terrified.

1177
01:27:14.490 --> 01:27:19.500
Nobody gets everything that they want.
Look at you. Look at Miranda.

1178
01:27:20.250 --> 01:27:22.670
You're good people
and look at what happened to you.

1179
01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:25.130
Of course something bad
is gonna happen to me.

1180
01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:26.840
Sweetie...

1181
01:27:27.010 --> 01:27:29.720
...you shit your pants this year.

1182
01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:31.010
Maybe you're done.

1183
01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:38.350
You run every day, that's what you do.

1184
01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:42.350
You can't stop being who you are
because you're afraid, right?

1185
01:27:44.190 --> 01:27:45.520
All right.

1186
01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:49.280
Okay. Here we go.

1187
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:52.780
Okay.

1188
01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:00.250
And as the last
of the autumn leaves fell away...

1189
01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:02.880
...so did Charlotte's fear.

1190
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:10.260
By the time the first snow fell,
Charlotte got her stride back.

1191
01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:21.310
Are you sure you don't want me
to R.S.V.P. To any of these holiday parties?

1192
01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:24.100
No, I am perfectly happy
spending time alone.

1193
01:28:24.270 --> 01:28:26.610
You sure?
Because this looks like a good one.

1194
01:28:26.770 --> 01:28:30.070
Go home. Seriously,
you're gonna miss your plane, go.

1195
01:28:30.450 --> 01:28:34.280
Okay. But first...

1196
01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:39.500
Merry Christmas.

1197
01:28:41.580 --> 01:28:45.170
- You didn't have to.
- It's just something silly.

1198
01:28:47.550 --> 01:28:48.960
Oh.

1199
01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:53.010
- Oh, Louise from St. Louis.
- You said you never saw it.

1200
01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:55.590
Well, jeez.

1201
01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:57.680
Now I feel bad.

1202
01:28:57.850 --> 01:29:01.390
If I had known
we were exchanging gifts...

1203
01:29:05.150 --> 01:29:07.980
...I would have bought you one
two weeks ago...

1204
01:29:08.150 --> 01:29:10.730
...and hidden it here.

1205
01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:18.830
- That is not what I think it is.
- I don't know, open it.

1206
01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:33.630
Oh, my God.

1207
01:29:33.930 --> 01:29:36.050
My very own Louis Vuitton?

1208
01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:39.050
That's right. No more rental for you.

1209
01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:42.470
Look who's home from the big city.

1210
01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:47.150
It was the best money I'd ever spent.

1211
01:29:47.980 --> 01:29:51.150
New Year's Eve and a cup of noodles.

1212
01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:03.000
So you remember
what you're gonna say at midnight?

1213
01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:06.330
- Happy New Year.
- Yeah.

1214
01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:09.330
Except you're gonna say it
much more excited than that.

1215
01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:14.800
- You're gonna say, "Happy New Year!"
- Happy New Year.

1216
01:30:14.970 --> 01:30:19.510
Yeah. And you say that
and then you kiss.

1217
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:28.900
All right.

1218
01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:31.570
- All ready to go, B-boy?
- Yeah.

1219
01:30:31.730 --> 01:30:34.740
Did you remember to pack
the Batman that Santa brought you?

1220
01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:36.280
I think it's in the kitchen.

1221
01:30:36.450 --> 01:30:38.530
Oh, you gotta have the new Batman, huh?

1222
01:30:46.410 --> 01:30:48.620
You got plans with the girls?

1223
01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:50.080
Um...

1224
01:30:50.250 --> 01:30:53.130
We're all kind of staying in tonight.

1225
01:30:55.010 --> 01:30:58.010
Would you like to
come out and eat with us?

1226
01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:02.550
We could go some place
on your side of the bridge.

1227
01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:05.560
No. Thank you.

1228
01:31:09.730 --> 01:31:12.560
Miranda, I never meant to hurt you.

1229
01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:23.080
Batman.
- Oh, there he is. Batman.

1230
01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:24.910
- Okay.
- Okay.

1231
01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:26.750
- Put your hat on.
- Yeah.

1232
01:31:26.910 --> 01:31:29.920
- It's snowing out.
- Here you go.

1233
01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:32.830
I'm gonna bring Batman.
Okay.

1234
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.840
Happy New Year.

1235
01:31:38.050 --> 01:31:39.220
Kiss.

1236
01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:52.440
All right, I'll see you tomorrow.

1237
01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:57.280
This is my new...

1238
01:32:00.110 --> 01:32:01.910
You know what we're gonna do?

1239
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:05.280
We're gonna light a firecracker
at midnight.

1240
01:33:14.910 --> 01:33:16.870
- Hello?
So I thought...

1241
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:19.120
...that one of the perks
of having a family...

1242
01:33:19.290 --> 01:33:23.040
...was that you didn't have to spend
New Year's Eve alone with Chinese food.

1243
01:33:23.210 --> 01:33:25.710
I am alone with Chinese food.

1244
01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:30.260
- I was asleep.
- Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

1245
01:33:30.420 --> 01:33:34.130
No, no, that's okay. Where's Brady?

1246
01:33:34.300 --> 01:33:38.010
- It's Steve's night.
- Oh. Right.

1247
01:33:38.180 --> 01:33:42.930
- Don't wake up. Go... Go back to sleep.
- No, it's okay.

1248
01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:45.600
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

1249
01:33:45.770 --> 01:33:47.810
I got all choked up...

1250
01:33:47.980 --> 01:33:51.530
...watching stupid New Year's Eve stuff
alone on TV.

1251
01:33:51.690 --> 01:33:55.530
- You want me to come over?
- I'm all the way downtown.

1252
01:33:55.700 --> 01:33:58.370
No, I can... You know, I can...
I grab a cab.

1253
01:33:59.370 --> 01:34:03.120
On New Year's? No way.
I'm... I'm... I'm fine.

1254
01:34:03.290 --> 01:34:05.710
Really. I just...
I just wanted to talk a little.

1255
01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:09.460
Go back to sleep. I'll...
I'll see you next year.

1256
01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:12.340
- Good night.
- Good night.

1257
01:34:50.340 --> 01:34:51.840
Good one.

1258
01:34:57.930 --> 01:35:00.510
- It's almost time.
- Champagne?

1259
01:35:10.810 --> 01:35:13.690
Oh, my God. Thank God you're here.

1260
01:36:46.990 --> 01:36:49.620
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

1261
01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:51.910
You're not alone.

1262
01:36:56.130 --> 01:36:59.010
Happy New Year.

1263
01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:46.050
- A young child that perhaps they've...
- Oh!

1264
01:37:46.220 --> 01:37:48.100
- Hey, easy there, girl.
- You all right?

1265
01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:49.310
Yeah. Thanks.

1266
01:37:49.470 --> 01:37:52.680
Three months driving in L.A.
And I forgot how to use my fucking legs.

1267
01:37:52.850 --> 01:37:54.600
Every spring, the women of New York...

1268
01:37:54.770 --> 01:37:59.190
...leave the foolish choices of their past
behind and look forward to the future.

1269
01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:01.530
This is known as Fashion Week.

1270
01:38:01.780 --> 01:38:03.740
Excuse me. Hi.

1271
01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:05.860
Oh, there we are.

1272
01:38:06.450 --> 01:38:10.370
- We're in the front row?
- I had to pull some strings.

1273
01:38:10.910 --> 01:38:13.000
- Very nice.
- I should go thank them.

1274
01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:17.170
Decide where we're gonna go for lunch
and I'll make a call. It's just like old times.

1275
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:20.250
So this is what you all
spent your Saturdays doing...

1276
01:38:20.420 --> 01:38:23.210
...while I was with Brady and Steve
at the Brooklyn Aquarium?

1277
01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:25.720
Well...

1278
01:38:26.010 --> 01:38:28.220
...not every Saturday.

1279
01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:32.560
Just so you know, we always had
front row at the mammal show.

1280
01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:35.810
Steve does the funniest
dolphin impression.

1281
01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:39.860
Actually, it's more Steve as a dolphin.

1282
01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:47.030
You really can't forgive him?

1283
01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:49.910
Are you suggesting something?

1284
01:38:50.910 --> 01:38:53.750
I like Steve. I always liked Steve.

1285
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:57.580
He's apologized 100 times.
He's not seeing anyone else.

1286
01:38:57.750 --> 01:38:58.750
What's it gonna take?

1287
01:38:59.130 --> 01:39:01.250
Are you also suggesting
that she forgive Big?

1288
01:39:01.420 --> 01:39:05.590
No. I could kill Big.

1289
01:39:06.010 --> 01:39:08.430
Sometimes when I'm running...

1290
01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:13.010
...I imagine what I would say to him
if I ever saw him again.

1291
01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:16.230
I have the perfect opening line.

1292
01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:18.350
Do you wanna hear it?

1293
01:39:19.190 --> 01:39:21.310
Uh, yeah.

1294
01:39:22.570 --> 01:39:25.610
I curse the day you were born.

1295
01:39:26.900 --> 01:39:30.450
That's impressive. You better work up
a hand gesture to go with it.

1296
01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:43.380
I didn't know if it was the fashion...

1297
01:39:43.550 --> 01:39:46.340
...or the fact that the four of us
were together again...

1298
01:39:46.510 --> 01:39:49.260
...but for the first time in a long time...

1299
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:51.800
...I felt like myself.

1300
01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:27.300
Well, let's get a cab, okay?
I'm absolutely starving. I don't know what...

1301
01:40:27.470 --> 01:40:29.050
Fur is murder!

1302
01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:32.680
Murder! Murder!

1303
01:40:32.850 --> 01:40:36.890
- Murder! Murder!
- God, I miss New York.

1304
01:40:39.810 --> 01:40:44.690
And a couple of weeks later, I met
Saint Louise's St. Louis boyfriend, Will.

1305
01:40:44.860 --> 01:40:47.650
Over Christmas, they realized
how much they loved each other.

1306
01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:49.490
- I'm Carrie.
- Will.

1307
01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:52.320
Just in time for Valentine's Day.

1308
01:41:18.180 --> 01:41:19.220
Hello?

1309
01:41:19.390 --> 01:41:22.730
I'm calling to make sure that you
aren't hanging from your shower rod.

1310
01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:27.320
- You called about an hour too early.
- So, what's the V-Day plan?

1311
01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:31.030
Well, Miranda and I are going to dinner...

1312
01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:33.570
...and then a very violent slasher movie.

1313
01:41:33.740 --> 01:41:35.370
- Perfect.
- You?

1314
01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:38.950
I'm making Smith sushi.
Pause for reaction.

1315
01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:41.000
Wow, you do that?

1316
01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:43.540
We took a class a while back.

1317
01:41:43.710 --> 01:41:45.830
And when he comes in that door
at 7:30...

1318
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.000
...I'm going to surprise him by
laying naked on the dining-room table...

1319
01:41:50.170 --> 01:41:52.510
...covered with homemade sushi.

1320
01:41:52.930 --> 01:41:55.470
Boy, you do have time on your hands.

1321
01:41:55.890 --> 01:41:57.720
So, what else is new?

1322
01:42:21.370 --> 01:42:24.500
There is a whole lot of love in this room.

1323
01:42:24.670 --> 01:42:27.790
Is it me or is Valentine's Day
this year on steroids?

1324
01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:31.500
No. I think it was like this last year.
We just played for the other team.

1325
01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:35.380
Good evening.
This is our Valentine's night menu.

1326
01:42:35.550 --> 01:42:39.300
All of our specials are romantically themed
and designed to be split for two.

1327
01:42:39.470 --> 01:42:40.810
- Are we having wine?
- Yes.

1328
01:42:40.970 --> 01:42:42.220
- Glass or a...?
- Bottle.

1329
01:42:42.390 --> 01:42:45.310
I'll be right back to take
you and your girlfriend's order.

1330
01:42:51.730 --> 01:42:55.570
Why would you have looked
at the Vogue today of all days?

1331
01:42:55.740 --> 01:42:57.740
Because I'm an emotional cutter.

1332
01:42:58.910 --> 01:43:01.990
I deserve what I got.
Running all over New York...

1333
01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:04.620
...believing that I'm finally getting
my happy ending.

1334
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:06.460
"See? Love does conquer all.

1335
01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:08.790
Look at me in
my one-of-a-kind wedding gown...

1336
01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:11.960
...marrying the love of my life."
- Would you like another bot...?

1337
01:43:12.130 --> 01:43:13.550
- Yes.
- Yes.

1338
01:43:15.090 --> 01:43:18.260
And Miranda, in that article,
I did not say "we" once.

1339
01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:23.220
No. The whole article
was "I think" and "I want."

1340
01:43:23.390 --> 01:43:26.430
- It was from your point of view.
- Yeah, exactly. My point of view.

1341
01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:29.940
Exactly. The whole wedding
was my point of view.

1342
01:43:31.110 --> 01:43:33.860
I let... I let the wedding
get bigger than Big.

1343
01:43:36.450 --> 01:43:39.910
I am the reason that
he did not get out of the car.

1344
01:43:41.530 --> 01:43:43.080
Okay.

1345
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:48.370
I said something to Big
that I shouldn't have...

1346
01:43:48.540 --> 01:43:50.370
...at the rehearsal dinner.

1347
01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:52.380
What do you mean?

1348
01:43:53.670 --> 01:43:56.760
After Steve showed up,
I was really upset.

1349
01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:59.130
And I bumped into Big...

1350
01:44:01.850 --> 01:44:04.310
...and I said that you two
were crazy to get married.

1351
01:44:04.470 --> 01:44:06.810
Here we go, your Shiraz.

1352
01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:18.900
Okay, great. Thanks so much.

1353
01:44:23.330 --> 01:44:27.160
I'm sorry. I was upset. Steve had...

1354
01:44:27.330 --> 01:44:31.790
I have been going over this and over this
in my mind for five months.

1355
01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:37.170
And for five months,
you kept a secret like that?

1356
01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:39.840
- I tried to tell you once, but then...
- Once?

1357
01:44:40.010 --> 01:44:42.640
You tried to tell me once?

1358
01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:46.010
You should have tried to tell me
every single day.

1359
01:44:46.180 --> 01:44:48.600
I know. I was waiting for the right time.

1360
01:44:48.770 --> 01:44:51.690
There is no right time to tell me
that you ruined my marriage.

1361
01:44:51.850 --> 01:44:54.360
It just happened. I wasn't thinking.

1362
01:44:56.440 --> 01:45:00.190
- Carrie, please don't go.
- You know what I think hurts the most?

1363
01:45:01.070 --> 01:45:03.490
Is that you kept a secret from me.

1364
01:45:03.660 --> 01:45:07.950
And I have never, ever
kept a secret from you.

1365
01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:09.790
Ever.

1366
01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:14.210
No, I'm lying. For the last five months...

1367
01:45:14.380 --> 01:45:18.710
...I've been thinking that it is
a huge mistake that you left Steve.

1368
01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:20.380
There.

1369
01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:23.050
How does it feel?

1370
01:45:23.220 --> 01:45:26.140
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1371
01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:48.330
Any minute now.

1372
01:45:58.170 --> 01:46:00.090
Hey, babe, it's me. Pick up.

1373
01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:02.420
Pick up.

1374
01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:04.970
All right, it's 7:20. I'm still at the studio.

1375
01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:09.100
We're behind. I'm gonna be a little bit late.
Sorry. Bye.

1376
01:46:18.770 --> 01:46:20.480
Forty minutes later...

1377
01:46:20.650 --> 01:46:25.030
...sushi, Samantha, still no Smith.

1378
01:46:31.580 --> 01:46:33.540
This is bullshit.

1379
01:47:04.780 --> 01:47:09.160
It was the same Valentine night
Samantha had planned...

1380
01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:11.490
...minus the sushi.

1381
01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:15.290
And the other woman.

1382
01:47:25.340 --> 01:47:27.170
I'm home.

1383
01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:30.470
- Man, that was a long day.
- You're three hours late.

1384
01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:32.970
Bummer, I know. Did you eat?

1385
01:47:33.140 --> 01:47:34.640
Yes, I ate.

1386
01:47:34.810 --> 01:47:36.930
I ate the sushi
that I hand-made for you.

1387
01:47:37.390 --> 01:47:42.360
The sushi that I laid all over my naked body
as a Valentine surprise for you.

1388
01:47:42.820 --> 01:47:45.360
Why are you so upset? I called.

1389
01:47:45.530 --> 01:47:47.360
I couldn't pick up the phone.

1390
01:47:47.530 --> 01:47:50.530
My body was covered everywhere
with sushi.

1391
01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:54.200
I got wasabi in places where
one should never get wasabi.

1392
01:47:54.370 --> 01:47:59.460
Oh, you think it's funny
that I slaved all day in this kitchen...

1393
01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:02.460
...to make a lovely meal for you?

1394
01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:06.840
You made some sushi. It's not a big deal.

1395
01:48:07.010 --> 01:48:09.180
"Not a big deal." Here.

1396
01:48:09.970 --> 01:48:11.390
I am not the type of woman...

1397
01:48:11.550 --> 01:48:13.850
...who sits home all day
waiting for a man!

1398
01:48:14.970 --> 01:48:19.560
Enjoy your California handmade roll!

1399
01:48:21.730 --> 01:48:25.150
Happy fucking Valentine's Day.

1400
01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:35.120
It's Carrie, leave me a message.

1401
01:48:35.290 --> 01:48:38.000
Carrie, it's me. Please pick up.

1402
01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:42.790
Three days of
"I'm sorry" calls and e-mails and flowers...

1403
01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:44.920
...and I still wasn't ready.

1404
01:48:45.090 --> 01:48:48.590
It was the longest we'd ever gone
without speaking.

1405
01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:56.510
Carrie.

1406
01:48:57.100 --> 01:48:58.180
Hi.

1407
01:48:59.140 --> 01:49:02.770
- I need to talk to you.
- How long have you been waiting here?

1408
01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:06.190
Seventeen-dollars long.

1409
01:49:08.780 --> 01:49:10.950
Please get in. It just hit 18.

1410
01:49:24.630 --> 01:49:29.260
- This is weird, not talking.
- I'm upset.

1411
01:49:30.510 --> 01:49:35.140
Carrie, I understand, but it just happened.
I never meant to hurt you.

1412
01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:41.640
You have to forgive me.

1413
01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:44.560
You know...

1414
01:49:44.730 --> 01:49:45.770
- What?
- No.

1415
01:49:45.940 --> 01:49:48.020
No, please, what were you gonna say?

1416
01:49:48.190 --> 01:49:51.150
You badger me to forgive you
in three days.

1417
01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:55.280
You won't even consider forgiving Steve
for something he did six months ago.

1418
01:49:55.660 --> 01:49:57.240
It's not the same thing.

1419
01:49:58.290 --> 01:49:59.830
It's forgiveness.

1420
01:50:04.750 --> 01:50:07.590
I don't know that I can trust
that it won't happen again.

1421
01:50:09.170 --> 01:50:10.920
Steve, you're very quiet today.

1422
01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:17.050
Miranda, I know I made it hard
for you to trust me...

1423
01:50:20.350 --> 01:50:23.140
...but you made it hard for me to trust you.
- Me?

1424
01:50:23.310 --> 01:50:26.690
The way you treated me
and cut me out of your life like that.

1425
01:50:26.860 --> 01:50:29.520
I mean, yea, I broke a vow...

1426
01:50:29.690 --> 01:50:32.690
...but what about the other vows?

1427
01:50:32.860 --> 01:50:36.820
Like promising to love someone
for better or for worse.

1428
01:50:36.990 --> 01:50:38.700
What about that?

1429
01:50:39.370 --> 01:50:42.540
How do I know she's not gonna
punish me for the rest of my life?

1430
01:50:42.700 --> 01:50:43.950
You don't.

1431
01:50:44.790 --> 01:50:49.340
And she doesn't know for sure that
you won't have another indiscretion.

1432
01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:54.970
All you can know is that
you wanna move forward...

1433
01:50:55.130 --> 01:50:59.550
...and risk that the love you have
for each other won't allow that to happen.

1434
01:51:02.850 --> 01:51:05.770
And that's what we'll discover here.

1435
01:51:11.570 --> 01:51:14.070
So we're done with our last session.

1436
01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:16.820
We're not allowed to talk to each other
for two weeks...

1437
01:51:16.990 --> 01:51:20.740
...while we figure out if being together
again is something that we really want.

1438
01:51:20.910 --> 01:51:24.370
And then we had to
pick a place to meet...

1439
01:51:24.540 --> 01:51:28.500
...and if we both show up on that day,
the past no longer exists.

1440
01:51:28.670 --> 01:51:31.380
It's like showing up
is our promise to each other...

1441
01:51:31.540 --> 01:51:36.090
...that we're both willing to
let it all go and move forward.

1442
01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:40.220
- Can you do that?
- I don't know.

1443
01:51:40.390 --> 01:51:43.560
I don't know.
I have a lot of thinking to do.

1444
01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:47.350
- Thinking? Or feeling?
- What do you mean?

1445
01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:51.860
Well, Miranda, you're a lawyer. You know,
you can argue both sides of any case.

1446
01:51:52.020 --> 01:51:57.440
But why we feel what we feel
isn't logical. It's emotional.

1447
01:51:58.110 --> 01:51:59.950
I'm sorry, Harvard, but I'm afraid...

1448
01:52:00.110 --> 01:52:03.620
...you're gonna have to base
this decision on your emotions.

1449
01:52:03.780 --> 01:52:06.950
Well, then I'm screwed.
I don't know what I feel.

1450
01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:09.540
You will. There will come a moment
when you know.

1451
01:52:09.710 --> 01:52:12.330
And if it's "yes" '
then all that brilliant logic...

1452
01:52:12.500 --> 01:52:15.130
...it's gonna go right out the window
with the past.

1453
01:52:16.460 --> 01:52:19.130
And I thought picking a spot to meet
was gonna be the challenge.

1454
01:52:19.300 --> 01:52:22.470
- Where is it?
- On the Brooklyn Bridge.

1455
01:52:23.140 --> 01:52:27.310
- Halfway between our two places.
- Very logical, and yet poetic.

1456
01:52:27.810 --> 01:52:30.020
Poetic if we both show up.

1457
01:52:30.190 --> 01:52:32.980
Otherwise you're on a bridge, rejected.

1458
01:52:34.230 --> 01:52:36.230
It's not a good plan.

1459
01:52:41.610 --> 01:52:43.740
- Hey.
Hey.

1460
01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:45.660
I got two pieces of good news.

1461
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:48.500
- Oh, and I've got two coffees.
- Thank you.

1462
01:52:48.660 --> 01:52:50.370
Here you go. So, what's up?

1463
01:52:50.540 --> 01:52:54.500
I just heard from your realtor
and the apartment on 5th has finally sold.

1464
01:52:54.670 --> 01:52:59.090
You got 60 days before the new owner
takes possession, and you're out of there.

1465
01:53:00.630 --> 01:53:02.510
And what is the other news?

1466
01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:11.350
I'm moving back to St. Louis
and we're getting married in the fall.

1467
01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:12.980
Oh, my God.

1468
01:53:13.650 --> 01:53:16.520
Wait a minute, I gotta see that.

1469
01:53:16.690 --> 01:53:21.280
- Well, it's gorgeous.
- And you know what? It ain't rented.

1470
01:53:25.620 --> 01:53:27.700
On the day of her decision deadline...

1471
01:53:27.870 --> 01:53:31.540
...true to form, Miranda had argued
both sides of the case.

1472
01:53:31.710 --> 01:53:33.210
Thank you.

1473
01:53:55.230 --> 01:53:57.230
It suddenly dawned on Miranda...

1474
01:53:57.400 --> 01:54:01.490
...that Steve's list might have
had more cons than pros.

1475
01:54:46.740 --> 01:54:49.780
And Miranda never looked back.

1476
01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:58.920
Well, almost never.

1477
01:54:59.090 --> 01:55:00.710
Kiss me.

1478
01:55:05.470 --> 01:55:09.140
Meanwhile, back in Lost Angeles...

1479
01:55:11.970 --> 01:55:15.640
Turns out New Age philosophy
wasn't the secret.

1480
01:55:17.650 --> 01:55:21.270
Samantha had money, a career,
and a man who loved her.

1481
01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:25.400
But still, she couldn't shake the feeling
that something was missing from her life.

1482
01:55:25.570 --> 01:55:27.490
Baby, come back.

1483
01:55:27.990 --> 01:55:30.070
That's not our house.

1484
01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:32.910
Where are you going?

1485
01:56:09.860 --> 01:56:12.450
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

1486
01:56:12.620 --> 01:56:14.030
I'm your next-door neighbor...

1487
01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:16.870
...and my dog ran up on
your dick... Deck.

1488
01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:22.960
Suddenly it wasn't so secret
what she was missing.

1489
01:56:23.340 --> 01:56:24.670
Wanna join me?

1490
01:56:34.600 --> 01:56:37.430
Hey. I'm Dante.

1491
01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:40.390
Stop by anytime.

1492
01:56:42.610 --> 01:56:44.690
It was official.

1493
01:56:44.860 --> 01:56:47.360
From the minute she met Dante...

1494
01:56:47.530 --> 01:56:50.610
...Samantha was in hell.

1495
01:56:52.490 --> 01:56:55.580
And by spring, I looked like my old self...

1496
01:56:55.740 --> 01:56:59.580
...in my new apartment,
just in time for the baby shower.

1497
01:56:59.750 --> 01:57:02.120
- Oh, excuse me, honey. Hi.
- Sure.

1498
01:57:02.290 --> 01:57:03.330
Hi.

1499
01:57:03.500 --> 01:57:06.040
A woman put a glass on your new desk
without a coaster.

1500
01:57:06.210 --> 01:57:08.760
I said, "If you do it again'
I'm gonna break your arm."

1501
01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:09.970
- Thanks.
- Bathroom?

1502
01:57:10.130 --> 01:57:12.760
- Yes. Hey, how's it going?
- Pretty good, I think.

1503
01:57:12.930 --> 01:57:14.390
Good, good, good.

1504
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:17.010
Where's Samantha?
Her plane landed two hours ago.

1505
01:57:17.180 --> 01:57:19.600
Oh, you know her.
She's probably working out first.

1506
01:57:19.770 --> 01:57:21.600
There's no place like home.

1507
01:57:21.770 --> 01:57:23.940
Sweetie.

1508
01:57:26.070 --> 01:57:27.400
You have a rat in your purse.

1509
01:57:27.570 --> 01:57:29.820
- That rat better be housebroken.
- Take your coat?

1510
01:57:29.990 --> 01:57:32.950
- Sure.
- Hey, cute bag.

1511
01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:35.700
Oh, my gos, Samantha.

1512
01:57:37.950 --> 01:57:40.160
You have a dog.

1513
01:57:40.330 --> 01:57:43.290
Did you ever think you'd see the day?
Me with a pooch?

1514
01:57:43.460 --> 01:57:45.250
Mother of God, what's with the gut?

1515
01:57:47.250 --> 01:57:49.130
Well, she's eating something out there.

1516
01:57:50.010 --> 01:57:52.090
- Come on in!
Hi!

1517
01:57:52.260 --> 01:57:53.970
We've been waiting for you.

1518
01:57:57.850 --> 01:58:01.220
I eat so I won't cheat.

1519
01:58:01.390 --> 01:58:03.060
What exactly are you eating?

1520
01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:05.730
Everything except Dante's dick.

1521
01:58:05.900 --> 01:58:08.570
Language, please.
This is a grown-up apartment now.

1522
01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:12.610
I guess I didn't realize how big I was
until I saw it on your faces.

1523
01:58:12.780 --> 01:58:15.610
How...? And I say this with love.

1524
01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:18.330
How could you not realize it?

1525
01:58:18.490 --> 01:58:21.830
- I've been avoiding mirrors.
- Well, I'm proud of you for not cheating.

1526
01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.120
I don't think there's anything
to be proud of.

1527
01:58:24.290 --> 01:58:28.420
I stuff my face to stop myself from
doing something that feels natural to me.

1528
01:58:28.590 --> 01:58:32.840
Now, listen, this isn't about the weight.
You would look gorgeous at any size.

1529
01:58:33.010 --> 01:58:36.510
- But are you happy?
- Well...

1530
01:58:38.100 --> 01:58:43.350
...relationships aren't always
about being happy, right?

1531
01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:46.140
I mean, how often do you feel happy
in your relationship?

1532
01:58:46.980 --> 01:58:49.270
I'm pretty sure that's to you.

1533
01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:53.780
- Every day.
- You feel happy every day?

1534
01:58:53.950 --> 01:58:57.990
Not all day every day, but every day.

1535
01:58:58.160 --> 01:59:00.660
When was the last time you felt happy?

1536
01:59:00.830 --> 01:59:02.910
Six months ago.

1537
01:59:03.200 --> 01:59:06.120
I think that's normal for L.A.

1538
01:59:06.290 --> 01:59:09.040
- What am I gonna do?
- What's your gut tell you?

1539
01:59:12.380 --> 01:59:17.180
I know, but Smith stayed with me
through chemo.

1540
01:59:18.340 --> 01:59:21.180
And if he can stay with me
through that...

1541
01:59:21.350 --> 01:59:24.600
...then I should be able to
stay in this relationship for him.

1542
01:59:24.770 --> 01:59:28.520
Sweetie, you just compared
your relationship to chemo.

1543
01:59:28.690 --> 01:59:33.230
Îohere we were,
the three mirrors Samantha couldn't avoid.

1544
01:59:33.400 --> 01:59:35.400
And Samantha?

1545
01:59:35.900 --> 01:59:38.490
That pillow cost $300.

1546
01:59:48.170 --> 01:59:50.130
Hi.

1547
01:59:50.290 --> 01:59:52.250
My little monster. Hi.

1548
01:59:53.920 --> 01:59:56.800
Hey. You're home.

1549
01:59:56.970 --> 02:00:00.550
- I thought you were staying the week.
- We need to talk.

1550
02:00:01.850 --> 02:00:04.100
Oh, man.

1551
02:00:05.980 --> 02:00:09.020
- I knew this was coming.
- Yeah.

1552
02:00:09.190 --> 02:00:11.060
This isn't working.

1553
02:00:11.230 --> 02:00:15.190
I've done my best.
I've given it five years and 15 pounds.

1554
02:00:15.360 --> 02:00:17.280
Well, what?

1555
02:00:19.450 --> 02:00:23.280
- You don't love me anymore?
- Yes, I love you.

1556
02:00:23.830 --> 02:00:25.080
It's just...

1557
02:00:27.410 --> 02:00:30.870
I'm just gonna say the thing
you're not supposed to say.

1558
02:00:31.420 --> 02:00:33.840
I love you but I love me more.

1559
02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:37.510
And I've been in a relationship
with myself for 49 years...

1560
02:00:37.670 --> 02:00:39.630
...and that's the one I need to work on.

1561
02:00:42.350 --> 02:00:46.770
You're gonna find a wonderful woman
who loves being in a relationship.

1562
02:00:49.980 --> 02:00:52.060
What will you find?

1563
02:00:52.690 --> 02:00:54.150
I don't know.

1564
02:00:54.860 --> 02:00:57.480
But that's a risk I'm willing to take.

1565
02:01:01.950 --> 02:01:06.700
- Hey, no. Keep it.
- Okay.

1566
02:01:09.620 --> 02:01:12.170
Every time I look down at it...

1567
02:01:15.540 --> 02:01:17.840
...I'm gonna think of you.

1568
02:01:20.130 --> 02:01:24.180
Some love stories aren't epic novels.
Some are short stories.

1569
02:01:24.350 --> 02:01:28.310
But that doesn't make them
any less filled with love.

1570
02:01:28.810 --> 02:01:30.270
At this time...

1571
02:01:30.430 --> 02:01:32.690
...we ask that all passengers
fasten their seat belts...

1572
02:01:32.850 --> 02:01:35.270
...in preparation for landing.

1573
02:01:35.730 --> 02:01:38.820
We're landing in New York.

1574
02:01:39.190 --> 02:01:40.820
I'm gonna need to take that now.

1575
02:01:43.530 --> 02:01:46.280
Okay. Here we go now. Give me that.

1576
02:01:49.500 --> 02:01:52.370
As someone returned to my life...

1577
02:01:52.540 --> 02:01:53.580
...someone left.

1578
02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:55.920
- Stamps, mailing labels.
- Okay.

1579
02:01:56.090 --> 02:01:59.710
And I put all your unopened mail
from your P.O. Box in these envelopes.

1580
02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:01.420
All right.

1581
02:02:05.340 --> 02:02:07.510
And please, please...

1582
02:02:07.680 --> 02:02:10.720
...do not make a mess
out of CarrieBradshaw. Com.

1583
02:02:10.890 --> 02:02:14.390
- Okay.
- It's my masterpiece.

1584
02:02:15.350 --> 02:02:18.980
- What am I gonna do without you?
- You'll find some other girl...

1585
02:02:19.610 --> 02:02:21.570
...but she won't have my style.

1586
02:02:22.570 --> 02:02:24.610
Saint Louise.

1587
02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:27.910
You brought me back to life.

1588
02:02:28.490 --> 02:02:31.910
And you gave me Louise Vuitton.

1589
02:02:38.290 --> 02:02:41.710
Serious. We need to stop crying.

1590
02:02:42.970 --> 02:02:45.130
- Your keys.
- Oh, thanks.

1591
02:02:45.300 --> 02:02:48.600
Wait, wait, wait. Don't forget your love.

1592
02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:52.680
No. I found my love.

1593
02:02:52.980 --> 02:02:55.440
I'm leaving that with you.

1594
02:02:56.100 --> 02:03:00.110
- See you at my wedding.
- I'll meet you in St. Louis.

1595
02:03:04.070 --> 02:03:05.570
Bye.

1596
02:03:12.290 --> 02:03:13.950
And a couple of weeks later...

1597
02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:17.290
...a slow-moving Charlotte
grabbed a quick lunch.

1598
02:03:17.460 --> 02:03:19.290
- Well, when are you due?
- Next week.

1599
02:03:19.460 --> 02:03:22.630
- You look gorgeous.
- Oh, thank you.

1600
02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:38.230
- Hi. Can I get you something to drink?
- No, no.

1601
02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:40.810
- No?
- No. I can't stay.

1602
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:43.940
Help me. Help me move the table.

1603
02:03:47.450 --> 02:03:49.030
Charlotte.

1604
02:03:49.990 --> 02:03:52.160
Charlotte, wait. Wait.

1605
02:03:52.330 --> 02:03:55.580
Charlotte. Charlotte, don't run,
you're pregnant.

1606
02:03:55.750 --> 02:03:59.460
I don't wanna see you.
I'm so mad at you.

1607
02:03:59.630 --> 02:04:04.340
I was always on your side.
And then you go and you do that to Carrie.

1608
02:04:04.510 --> 02:04:09.840
No! No! I'm not gonna cry.
I'm not gonna waste tears on you.

1609
02:04:11.100 --> 02:04:14.010
I curse the day you were born.

1610
02:04:17.810 --> 02:04:20.350
I think my water just broke. Oh, my God.

1611
02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:22.650
- Taxi!
- My car's right there.

1612
02:04:22.820 --> 02:04:25.440
I don't wanna get in your car! Taxi!

1613
02:04:25.610 --> 02:04:28.190
Please, I gotta get you
to the hospital, okay? Please?

1614
02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:30.200
- Okay?
Lenox Hill.

1615
02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:31.990
Okay. Start the car.

1616
02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:41.880
Hey.

1617
02:04:42.040 --> 02:04:46.210
Hi. Congratulations. A girl.

1618
02:04:46.670 --> 02:04:49.470
It's my lot in life to be surrounded
by beautiful women.

1619
02:04:50.220 --> 02:04:51.680
Come here.

1620
02:04:56.970 --> 02:05:00.480
- She's gorgeous.
- Say hello to Rose.

1621
02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:05.150
- Rose. What a beautiful name.
- It's after Harry's bubbe.

1622
02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:08.530
Now we got a Lily and a Rose.

1623
02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:10.610
Well...

1624
02:05:10.780 --> 02:05:14.570
...I have to say,
you two are very cool customers...

1625
02:05:14.740 --> 02:05:20.000
...making the "baby's here" call
without all the "I'm in labor" drama.

1626
02:05:20.160 --> 02:05:22.750
There was plenty of drama.

1627
02:05:23.710 --> 02:05:26.500
My water broke while I was standing
in front of a restaurant.

1628
02:05:26.920 --> 02:05:31.090
- Wow, that's very dramatic.
- Wait, wait, she's not done.

1629
02:05:31.260 --> 02:05:34.260
- It broke while I was talking to Big.
- What?

1630
02:05:34.430 --> 02:05:36.470
See? Drama.

1631
02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:39.270
I ran into him and
I got so upset, my water broke.

1632
02:05:40.270 --> 02:05:44.020
He brought her to the hospital,
stayed until the baby was born.

1633
02:05:45.190 --> 02:05:47.770
I think he was hoping to see you.

1634
02:05:50.860 --> 02:05:55.070
Well, today is not about him.
It's about beautiful baby Rose.

1635
02:05:56.200 --> 02:05:59.790
So we know she has Charlotte's hair.
What else do we know?

1636
02:06:02.500 --> 02:06:06.460
- She's a doll. Mazel tov.
- Thank you.

1637
02:06:07.460 --> 02:06:08.960
Bye.

1638
02:06:09.300 --> 02:06:12.470
He asked me to ask you to call him.

1639
02:06:13.300 --> 02:06:16.390
I know, it's none of my business,
but I felt bad for the schmuck...

1640
02:06:16.550 --> 02:06:18.850
...hanging around the hospital
hoping to see you.

1641
02:06:19.010 --> 02:06:23.730
Every time he heard someone in heels
walking down the hall, his heart stopped.

1642
02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:30.020
Harry, it's... It's so much more complicated
than you can imagine.

1643
02:06:30.190 --> 02:06:34.150
I know it is, and you have every right
to never call him, but I just...

1644
02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:38.200
I'm a big pile of love today
and I feel bad for the guy.

1645
02:06:38.370 --> 02:06:41.290
He said he's been writing you,
but you never responded.

1646
02:06:42.910 --> 02:06:44.330
No, he's never written to me.

1647
02:06:44.500 --> 02:06:47.630
He said he wrote because
he didn't have your phone number.

1648
02:06:48.670 --> 02:06:51.590
No, he's never written. Ever.

1649
02:06:51.760 --> 02:06:54.800
Then why would he say he had?

1650
02:07:35.170 --> 02:07:40.140
Two hours, two manila envelopes
and countless e-mails later...

1651
02:07:40.300 --> 02:07:44.430
...I was just about to give up
on the big riddle when...

1652
02:07:44.600 --> 02:07:49.150
I had told Louise to put Big in a place where
I would never have to hear from him again.

1653
02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:02.740
This is Louise, leave a message.

1654
02:08:02.910 --> 02:08:04.910
Hey... Hey, Louise, it's me.

1655
02:08:05.080 --> 02:08:09.420
Can you give me the password
for your assistant file?

1656
02:08:09.580 --> 02:08:11.040
Um...

1657
02:08:11.210 --> 02:08:13.590
Okay, call me. Thanks.

1658
02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:18.130
Oh, shit.

1659
02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:38.030
As soon as I typed in "love,"
there he was.

1660
02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:45.620
And because Big
still didn't have the words...

1661
02:08:45.790 --> 02:08:48.450
...he retyped a love letter
from Beethoven.

1662
02:08:50.580 --> 02:08:51.790
And Lord Byron.

1663
02:08:53.420 --> 02:08:55.750
And John Keats.

1664
02:08:56.090 --> 02:08:57.380
And Voltaire.

1665
02:08:58.090 --> 02:09:02.180
There they were, the love letters
of great men, volume one.

1666
02:09:02.340 --> 02:09:06.810
Plus one more
written by John James Preston.

1667
02:09:22.990 --> 02:09:25.490
I wanted to call him, but our love...

1668
02:09:25.660 --> 02:09:28.910
...Carrie and Big,
volumes one, two and three...

1669
02:09:29.370 --> 02:09:31.290
...stopped me.

1670
02:09:36.380 --> 02:09:37.420
Hello?

1671
02:09:37.590 --> 02:09:40.550
I didn't hear my phone.
We're shopping for my wedding gown.

1672
02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:42.880
That dress makes your boobies look big.

1673
02:09:43.050 --> 02:09:45.930
- Mama, can you please? This is a work call.
- Shut up.

1674
02:09:46.100 --> 02:09:50.890
- No, it's okay, I figured it out.
- Well, I was gonna call you anyway.

1675
02:09:51.060 --> 02:09:53.390
Today is the final day
on the 5th Avenue apartment.

1676
02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:55.770
You have till 6:00
before they change the locks.

1677
02:09:55.940 --> 02:09:57.690
No, I don't need to go over there.

1678
02:09:58.280 --> 02:10:00.190
Do you not want those never-worn shoes?

1679
02:10:00.360 --> 02:10:02.740
Oh, God, I completely forgot.

1680
02:10:02.910 --> 02:10:06.530
If you don't, you can send them to me
and I'll squeeze my feet into them.

1681
02:10:06.700 --> 02:10:08.580
But it's already 5:00.

1682
02:10:08.740 --> 02:10:12.250
Hello? They are never-been-worn'
$400 shoes.

1683
02:10:12.410 --> 02:10:17.290
Actually 525.
Yeah, okay. All right, thanks. Bye.

1684
02:10:18.130 --> 02:10:20.170
Taxi!

1685
02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:33.140
The light in our prewar apartment...

1686
02:10:33.310 --> 02:10:36.600
...looked completely different postwar.

1687
02:10:57.210 --> 02:11:01.920
I was gonna get these to you.
I didn't want it to be a total loss.

1688
02:11:02.210 --> 02:11:06.090
It wasn't logic, it was love.

1689
02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:30.200
Why did we ever decide to get married?

1690
02:11:32.370 --> 02:11:37.870
I guess we were afraid
it would mean something if we didn't.

1691
02:11:42.090 --> 02:11:48.550
I'm sorry to have done that to you.

1692
02:11:52.560 --> 02:11:54.640
You know the funny part?

1693
02:11:56.690 --> 02:11:58.900
Is there a funny part?

1694
02:11:59.060 --> 02:12:03.360
We were perfectly happy before
we decided to live happily ever after.

1695
02:12:03.820 --> 02:12:05.690
Guess the joke's on us.

1696
02:12:14.750 --> 02:12:18.580
- It's a good closet.
- Thanks.

1697
02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:24.250
It's comfortable.

1698
02:12:24.590 --> 02:12:27.920
Is this what you had in mind
when you installed the carpet?

1699
02:12:28.970 --> 02:12:31.970
I'd like to think I was that smooth.

1700
02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:43.230
We better get up
before the new owners bust in on us.

1701
02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:56.040
And the way we decided to get married...

1702
02:12:56.200 --> 02:12:58.120
...it was all business.

1703
02:12:58.290 --> 02:13:00.460
No romance.

1704
02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:08.050
That's not the way
you propose to someone.

1705
02:13:09.470 --> 02:13:11.470
This is.

1706
02:13:14.970 --> 02:13:17.060
Carrie Bradshaw...

1707
02:13:17.770 --> 02:13:19.140
...love of my life...

1708
02:13:22.020 --> 02:13:24.060
...will you marry me?

1709
02:13:28.940 --> 02:13:31.280
See, this is why there's a diamond.

1710
02:13:31.450 --> 02:13:33.570
You need to do something
to close the deal.

1711
02:13:58.140 --> 02:13:59.350
And forsaking all others...

1712
02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:03.390
And in the end, Carrie Bradshaw
married John James Preston...

1713
02:14:03.560 --> 02:14:05.230
...in a label-less dress.
- I do.

1714
02:14:05.690 --> 02:14:08.360
Then by the power vested in me
by the state of New York...

1715
02:14:08.530 --> 02:14:13.110
...I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

1716
02:14:23.710 --> 02:14:25.710
Ever thine. Ever mine.

1717
02:14:26.500 --> 02:14:29.170
Ever ours.

1718
02:14:31.590 --> 02:14:33.930
So you're okay that it was just us?

1719
02:14:34.090 --> 02:14:38.680
It was perfect. You and me, like I said.

1720
02:14:38.850 --> 02:14:42.100
Still, it would have been nice
if you had the girls here.

1721
02:14:43.770 --> 02:14:46.190
Which is why I called them.

1722
02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:53.190
- Hi, Carrie!
- Mazel tov!

1723
02:14:56.410 --> 02:14:59.490
- Ham and eggs. Ham and eggs for you, sir.
- Yup, that's me.

1724
02:14:59.660 --> 02:15:02.330
It wasn't a fancy, designer reception either.

1725
02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:05.000
Just food and friends.

1726
02:15:07.210 --> 02:15:09.090
Butter, ma'am?

1727
02:15:11.340 --> 02:15:13.050
How's the marriage going?

1728
02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:38.410
"And as I put the wedding gown away'
I couldn't help but wonder:

1729
02:15:38.570 --> 02:15:42.790
'Why is it that we're willing
to write our own vows...

1730
02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:46.460
...but not our own rules?"'

1731
02:15:46.670 --> 02:15:49.170
And that's just a little something
I'm working on.

1732
02:15:51.630 --> 02:15:53.380
Thank you.

1733
02:15:55.050 --> 02:15:56.720
Oh, my God.

1734
02:15:59.140 --> 02:16:01.800
Maybe some labels
are best left in the closet.

1735
02:16:01.970 --> 02:16:03.470
Maybe when we label people:

1736
02:16:03.640 --> 02:16:07.890
"Bride," "groom," "husband,"
"wife," "married," "single"...

1737
02:16:08.060 --> 02:16:11.560
...we forget to look past the label
to the person.

1738
02:16:12.770 --> 02:16:15.820
- This is delicious.
- Why did we ever stop drinking these?

1739
02:16:15.990 --> 02:16:19.610
- Because everyone else started.
- Well, that one's an oldie but goodie.

1740
02:16:19.780 --> 02:16:22.580
And speaking of an oldie but goodie...

1741
02:16:25.500 --> 02:16:27.620
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

1742
02:16:28.580 --> 02:16:30.630
Wait, wait, wait. A toast.

1743
02:16:30.790 --> 02:16:32.340
To Samantha.

1744
02:16:32.500 --> 02:16:35.250
Fifty and fabulous.

1745
02:16:41.350 --> 02:16:43.180
To us...

1746
02:16:44.930 --> 02:16:46.020
...and the next 50.

1747
02:16:46.180 --> 02:16:48.520
To the next 50.

1748
02:16:50.600 --> 02:16:54.980
And there, in the same city
where they met as girls...

1749
02:16:55.150 --> 02:16:59.490
...four New York women
entered the next phase of their lives...

1750
02:16:59.660 --> 02:17:03.280
...dressed head to toe in love.

1751
02:17:03.910 --> 02:17:06.120
And that's the one label...

1752
02:17:06.290 --> 02:17:09.500
...that never goes out of style.
