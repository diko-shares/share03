00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.720
Year after year, 20-something
women come to New York City...

2
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.720
...in search of the two L's:

3
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.100
Labels and love.

4
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.140
- Yeah.
- It's the best.

5
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.310
Hot dress!

6
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.820
Twenty years ago, I was one of them.

7
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.040
Having gotten the knack for labels early,
I concentrated on my search for love.

8
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.380
Turns out, a knockoff is not as easy to spot
when it comes to love.

9
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.460
What? You're married?

10
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.880
You fucking asshole!
Motherfucker, you're married?

11
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.390
- Until it is.
- I fucking hate you.

12
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.010
That is why you need help to spot them.

13
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.180
Lots of help.

14
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.350
Help also known as Charlotte York...

15
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.860
...Miranda Hobbes...

16
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.440
...and Samantha Jones.

17
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.150
- Oh, my God, look at his.
Hey.

18
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.700
Hi, how are you?

19
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.540
Oh, well.

20
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.460
My name is Carrie Bradshaw,
and I'm a writer.

21
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.420
Year after year,
my single girlfriends were my salvation.

22
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.210
And as it turns out, my meal ticket.

23
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.470
I've been dating since I was 15.
I'm exhausted. Where is he?

24
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.060
Charlotte was looking
for the pertect love.

25
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.270
- Trey can't get it up.
- Well, almost perfect.

26
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.980
I'm becoming a Jew.

27
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.150
We're not barren,
we're reproductively challenged.

28
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.570
- They're giving us a baby.
- That's our baby.

29
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.120
So Charlotte and Harry journeyed
to China and back...

30
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.490
...for their daughter, Lily.

31
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.870
Miranda was a disciple of tough love.

32
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.750
Bye. Great sex.

33
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.170
- Steve, I'm pregnant.
- You're what?

34
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.380
Carrie.

35
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.420
I, Miranda Hobbes,
take you, Steve Brady...

36
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.590
And Miranda journeyed to Brooklyn
for Brady and Steve.

37
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.930
Who wants a Popsicle?

38
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.100
Oh, man. Boy.

39
00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.180
Samantha's love was sex.

40
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.890
Lots of sex.

41
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.600
I'm dating a guy
with the funkiest-tasting spunk.

42
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.110
Can I cancel my rice pudding?

43
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.860
And then she found a man
that combined sex and love.

44
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.360
I'm gonna help you be a star.

45
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.450
Yes, he is interested...

46
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.830
So Samantha journeyed to Hollywood
with television star Smith Jerrod.

47
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.250
As for me,
I was looking for something big.

48
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.710
Get in.

49
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.920
Mr. Big. Turns out when that big
love comes along, it's not always easy.

50
00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.340
Just tell me I'm the one.

51
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.640
And despite all the other chapters
of my life...

52
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.310
...no one was ever quite
big enough until...

53
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.810
Carrie, you're the one.

54
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.850
And just like that, I was.

55
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.270
Three books and three years later...

56
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.200
...we still feel like those four single girls.

57
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.950
And even though time had moved us on...

58
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.660
...I managed to stay exactly where I was:

59
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.000
In love.

60
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.010
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

61
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.180
I got a good feeling about this one, kid.

62
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.430
Oh, I hope so.
I've always loved this block.

63
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.390
Hi, 3C?

64
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.440
Finding the perfect apartment
in New York City...

65
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.280
...is like finding the perfect partner.
It can take years.

66
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.160
- So how many is this?
- Thirty-three.

67
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.490
Lucky 33.

68
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.620
- The worst. I just left you a message.
- And the kitchen's through here.

69
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.710
That's the window with the best view.

70
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.130
Thirty-four? Lucky 34?

71
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.640
Well, if anything else opens up,
let us know.

72
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.640
We're very interested in this building.

73
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.680
I do have another apartment
that's not even on the market yet.

74
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.100
Care to take a look?

75
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.310
- Sure.
- Sure.

76
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.060
All right, then.

77
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.440
It's more than you were looking to pay.

78
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.900
- How much more?
- More.

79
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.250
So this is where they keep the light.

80
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.460
Oh, my God.

81
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.500
I have died
and gone to real-estate heaven.

82
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.590
Just a simple home for two.

83
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.090
And across the rooftop terrace...

84
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.560
What, nirvana?

85
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.730
Hello. I live here.

86
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.070
Your wife has quite a sense of humor.

87
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.320
- They're not married.
- He's my boyfriend.

88
00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.660
This way.

89
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.450
Aren't I a little old
to be introduced as your boyfriend?

90
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.460
Point taken. From now on,
you'll be my man-friend.

91
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.380
- That sounds like a dog.
- Well, if the shoe fits...

92
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.960
And this is the master bedroom.

93
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.380
Uh.

94
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.800
It's hideous. I hate it. Hurts my eyes.

95
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.810
- How is this place even available?
- Nasty divorce.

96
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.100
If you live here,
what is there to fight about?

97
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:36.900
Hm.

98
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.740
- Well, now I understand the divorce.
- I can build you a better closet.

99
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.160
Welcome home, baby.

100
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.330
Can...? Can we afford this?

101
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.210
I got it.

102
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.960
Okay, let's sign some contracts.

103
00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.380
"I got it." Just like that.

104
00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.510
- Like he was picking up a check for coffee.
- It sounds perfect.

105
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.970
Except for the closet,
which Big says he can redo.

106
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.760
And he says the kitchen needs work.

107
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.270
Of course, I don't know about that
because I keep sweaters in my stove.

108
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.560
So he bought it
and you'll live there with him.

109
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.020
Yes, together. That's right.

110
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.860
But he'll own it, so
you're keeping your own place, right?

111
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.610
I haven't figured out the details,
but I'm a smart girl.

112
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.190
I'll figure out something
that I'm comfortable with.

113
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.450
I just wanna be sure
that you're being smart.

114
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.030
And I love you for that.

115
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.780
But for now,
can't you stop worrying for me...

116
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:30.160
...and just go ahead and feel
what I want you to feel, jealous?

117
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:35.790
Oh, jealous of me living in this
gorgeous penthouse in Manhattan.

118
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.790
- All right, I'm jealous.
- Thanks.

119
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.880
You live in real-estate heaven
and I live in Brooklyn.

120
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.930
New York magazine said
Brooklyn is the new Manhattan.

121
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:45.930
Whoever wrote that lives in Brooklyn.

122
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.510
- Hey, there she is. Hey, Hollywood.
- Hey.

123
00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.140
Oh, lady. Hi.

124
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.270
- How was your flight?
- Fabulous.

125
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.480
- Oh, good.
- Good.

126
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.270
- Let's go in. I'm so excited.
Show us.

127
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:03.700
It was a rare occasion that brought
all types of New York women together.

128
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.410
Sorry.

129
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.700
Blair Elkenn was a waitress
turned model turned actress...

130
00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.750
...turned billionaire's girlfriend
who came home one night...

131
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:16.580
...to find herself unceremoniously
turned out on the street.

132
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:17.750
Oh, my God.

133
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.250
And now she was getting
the ultimate breakup revenge:

134
00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.470
An embarrassing
and very public auction...

135
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.760
...of all the jewelry he had given her
when they were happy.

136
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.260
There it is. My baby.

137
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:31.930
Oh, she's a beauty.

138
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.060
When I saw it in the catalog,
I said to Smith:

139
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:39.690
"This flower ring is the essence of me.
One of a kind, filled with fire."

140
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.780
- And a little too much.
- Exactly.

141
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.490
Let's go spend some of
my hard-earned Hollywood money.

142
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.620
And now Lot 39, the flower ring.

143
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.830
That's it.

144
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:53.750
We'd like to start the bidding
on this at $10,000, please.

145
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:56.750
At ten-thousand doll...
Thank you, madam. At 10,000.

146
00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.420
Fifteen thousand. At $15,000.

147
00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.460
Hey, she's bidding for somebody
on the phone.

148
00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.130
That's not fair.
- Bitch.

149
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.300
The gloves are off.

150
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.050
At $30,000. Now it's against you.
Thirty-five thousand.

151
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.640
- I work hard, I deserve this.
At 40,000 now.

152
00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:17.310
At 40? Forty thousand?
Forty thousand, thank you.

153
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.440
Forty-five thousand. At $45,000.
Now 50,000?

154
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.150
Fifty fucking thousand.

155
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:28.570
At 50,000. Fifty-five thousand?
At $55,000 against you.

156
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:33.160
Would you like to say 60?
Sixty to our colorful bidder? At 60,000?

157
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.410
I draw the line at 50.

158
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:41.040
I thought this auction would be more fun,
but it's kind of sad.

159
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:42.290
Isn't it?

160
00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.630
I thought it was just sad for me
because I know her.

161
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.510
But it really is sad, huh?

162
00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:50.050
And it's funny
because they were so happy.

163
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.680
- Yeah, till they weren't.
- I know, right?

164
00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:58.190
We all told her to get married
but she didn't wanna listen.

165
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.610
He'd been married three times before,
so she let it ride...

166
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:05.610
...and then she came home one night
and he had locked her out.

167
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.650
She didn't even have anywhere to live.

168
00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:11.320
Such a shame. After 10 years.

169
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.200
She was a smart girl...

170
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.490
...till she fell in love.

171
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:25.880
I'm thinking...

172
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.840
...l'm going to sell my apartment...

173
00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:32.050
...and put the money towards
heaven on 5th.

174
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.220
Why? You love your apartment.

175
00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:38.390
I know, but there's plenty of room
in the new place and...

176
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:41.980
And besides, l...

177
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.730
I want to make us a life there.

178
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.070
You know, l... I want it to be ours.

179
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.400
It is ours. I bought it for us.

180
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:55.410
And that's so amazing,
but you bought it.

181
00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:01.410
So really it's your place
and if anything were to happen...

182
00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:02.960
What's going to happen?

183
00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:07.920
Come on, I have to be smart here.
We're not married, I'd have no legal rights...

184
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:12.340
...you know, to...
To this home that I built...

185
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.260
...with you.

186
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.270
Did you wanna get married?

187
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.110
Well, I didn't...
I didn't think that was an option.

188
00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.860
What if it was an option?

189
00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.780
Why? What, do you wanna get married?

190
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.160
I wouldn't mind being married to you.

191
00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.780
Would you mind being married to me?

192
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:42.410
No. No, not if...
Not if that's what you wanted.

193
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:48.130
I mean, is...? Is that what you want?

194
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.130
I want you.

195
00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.550
So...

196
00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.970
...okay.

197
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.640
So...?

198
00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:01.100
- Really? We're...? We're getting married?
- We're getting married.

199
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:04.730
- Should we get you a diamond?
- No, no.

200
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:07.940
Just get me a really big closet.

201
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:14.240
So the other night Big and I
were talking about...

202
00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:19.410
...you know,
moving in together and our future...

203
00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.410
...and, you know, what makes sense
as we move forward and...

204
00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:26.040
...well...

205
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.090
...we decided to get married.

206
00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:34.010
- And I'm deaf.
- I'm so excited!

207
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.680
- Everybody is looking.
- Sorry!

208
00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.850
I'm so sorry, everyone...

209
00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:42.180
...but this is my friend
and she just got engaged.

210
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:47.520
And she has been going out
with the man for 10 years.

211
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.030
I'm mortified.

212
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:56.280
There is literally a ringing in my ear.

213
00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.200
And the big news
was about to go bicoastal.

214
00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:00.370
Samantha Jones.

215
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:04.660
Well, I made a little decision
I hope you'll be happy about.

216
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:09.670
- Oh, honey, you finally got Botox.
- No, I did not get Botox.

217
00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.340
- I'm telling you, Carrie, you're gonna love it.
- I did not call...

218
00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:16.170
...to talk about Botox.
- Well, I'm just saying.

219
00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:18.550
So last week...

220
00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.100
...after the auction,
I started thinking about my options.

221
00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.390
- Right.
- And, um...

222
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:30.400
Well, Big and I decided to get married.

223
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.440
- Really?
- Yeah.

224
00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.530
Well, that's great.

225
00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.070
You sounded more excited
about the Botox.

226
00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.580
Honey, I am excited for you,
but you know me.

227
00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.750
I don't really believe in marriage.

228
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:49.580
Now, Botox, on the other hand,
that works every time.

229
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:51.670
Honey, l... I gotta go.

230
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.250
We can catch up
when I'm in town next week.

231
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:08.350
Hello.

232
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:10.600
I think I was in shock.

233
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.400
I mean, it's you getting married.

234
00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:15.780
This is not some random person, it's you.

235
00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:16.990
Yeah, I hear you.

236
00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:20.780
I thought that after that big mess with
Aidan, you'd never wanna get married.

237
00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.120
So I put you in my
"we're never getting married" file.

238
00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:27.450
Now I'm gonna have to
take you out of that file.

239
00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:31.620
Well, I'm sorry about
all the extra paperwork.

240
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:32.830
You'll get my bill.

241
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.960
Samantha, it just feels
so different this time.

242
00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:40.930
You know, there's no clichÃ©d
romantic kneeling on one knee.

243
00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:42.680
It's just...

244
00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:47.600
...two grownups making a decision
about spending their lives together.

245
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:50.810
Well, I'm happy for you.

246
00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.850
Oh, and Hey, one more thing.

247
00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:57.400
I want you to be maid of honor.

248
00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:00.820
- How do you feel about that?
- The same way you feel about Botox:

249
00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:02.740
Painful and unnecessary.

250
00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:07.990
- Seventy-four, 75, 76. Seventy-six guests.
- Seventy-five sounds better.

251
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.660
A small wedding of 75 guests.

252
00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:14.920
Seventy-six trombones, yes.
Seventy-six guests, no.

253
00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:17.090
As a wedding gift,
Charlotte had given me...

254
00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.880
...Anthony Marantino,
friend and wedding planner.

255
00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:21.670
All right.

256
00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.010
Well, that's...

257
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.180
Cutthroat. I love it.
I hope you're this decisive...

258
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:30.270
...when it comes to location and the dress.
- I found the dress.

259
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.850
- What? When?
- Yeah, the other day. I have it.

260
00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:38.530
- This is gonna be good.
- I am so excited.

261
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:40.530
Okay.

262
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.900
Here it is.

263
00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:49.700
That was the exact reaction
I was aiming for.

264
00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:53.370
It's pretty, but it's... It's so simple.

265
00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.420
It's simple and classic.

266
00:15:55.580 --> 00:16:00.710
When I saw it, I thought'
"That is what I should marry Big in."

267
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:05.180
- Well, who's it by? What's the label?
- No one. I found it at a vintage shop.

268
00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.890
The bride wore a dress by no one.

269
00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.640
Oh, come on,
you know I'm gonna merchandise it up...

270
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:14.230
...style it up with some shoes.
Right.

271
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.400
The invitation is fancier than the dress.

272
00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.520
- I heard that.
- I meant you to.

273
00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:22.110
Don't tell anyone.

274
00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:35.170
"The ultimate single gal, Carrie
Bradshaw, will be married in Manolos...

275
00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:39.920
...to New York financier
John James Preston come fall."

276
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:43.260
- Our wedding's on Page Six.
- Who would put that in there?

277
00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:48.720
"Proving to single gals everywhere
that there can be a happy ending over 40."

278
00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:52.640
- Carrie.
- Congratulations.

279
00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:56.310
It seemed everywhere I went,
people had seen Page Six.

280
00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.440
Even people you didn't expect,
like my Vogue editor, Enid.

281
00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:03.190
We're putting together
our annual age issue...

282
00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.860
...and we'd like you to do 40.

283
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.280
- Great. Who am I interviewing?
- No.

284
00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:09.570
You. You are 40.

285
00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:13.450
I want you to be featured in the magazine
as the 40-year-old...

286
00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:16.290
And here's the brilliant twist.
- Bride.

287
00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.590
Wait, I'm... I would be in the magazine?

288
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:25.220
In bridal couture.
It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity...

289
00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:30.510
...so spare me a week of
faux soul-searching and just say yes.

290
00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:34.100
Enid, I am so very flattered,
but honestly, l...

291
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:35.980
Carrie, Vogue designers.

292
00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.810
Vogue photographers.

293
00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.650
Vogue airbrushing.

294
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:43.150
Nod your head. Yes.

295
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:48.320
Thank you. It will be a sensation.

296
00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:50.950
We're calling it "The Last Single Girl."

297
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:55.160
Well, I'm hardly the last single girl.

298
00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:59.500
No, but 40 is the last age a woman
can be photographed in a wedding gown...

299
00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:02.590
...without the unintended
Diane Arbus subtext.

300
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:06.260
I thought the issue was
"Great Style at Every Age."

301
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.510
Style, yes. Bride, no.

302
00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.520
- Is that better?
- Just your typical Wednesday.

303
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.190
Hanging out with old friends
like Stanford Blatch...

304
00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.690
...and new friends like Vera Wang.

305
00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:26.480
She's looking at home for someone
who didn't think she had the bride gene.

306
00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:29.360
- Well, I guess with the right man...
- And the right dress.

307
00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:33.370
When I get married, I'm wearing
something like that, only bigger.

308
00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.160
Beauty. Hot.

309
00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.200
Love the veil.

310
00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.710
And Carolina Herrera.

311
00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.710
Nothing fancy, but it's beautiful.
Good work.

312
00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:47.010
Great, let's do it.

313
00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:00.390
And Christian Lacroix.

314
00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.200
And Lanvin.

315
00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.200
And Dior.

316
00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.500
And Oscar de la Renta.

317
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:36.720
And finally, Vivienne Westwood.

318
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:39.220
A dress so special...

319
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:44.400
...it could bring a wedding tear from
even the most unbelieving of women.

320
00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:54.780
And then, the impossible happened.

321
00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.430
And just like that...

322
00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:26.650
...Vivienne Westwood
kicked my sweet little suit's ass.

323
00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.450
Can I lean?

324
00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.630
Are you the last person in New York
still taking out library books?

325
00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:50.090
I love the smell.

326
00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.760
Mm.

327
00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.970
Oh. That's an oldie.

328
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.850
"Love Letters of Great Men,
Volume One."

329
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.100
- Oh, am I in there?
- No, no.

330
00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:06.390
But some of your classmates are'
like Voltaire, Napoleon.

331
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:11.650
- Young lady, you need to get glasses.
- No, I don't. I have yours.

332
00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.030
Okay, here's Napoleon.

333
00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:18.160
"My dearest Josephine,
I wake consumed with thoughts of you."

334
00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.530
Typical short guy.
Gives it all away upfront.

335
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:24.830
- Why are you reading this?
- It's research for my new book.

336
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.580
- Oh. What's it about?
- Love.

337
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:30.380
I used to write about finding love.

338
00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:33.960
Now I wanna write about
what happens after you've found it.

339
00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:35.880
Interesting.

340
00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:39.300
- What happens?
- Mm. Stay tuned.

341
00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:42.220
Oh, here, listen. It's Beethoven.

342
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:44.770
Bring it, Ludwig.

343
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:49.900
"My thoughts go out to you'
my immortal beloved.

344
00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:53.860
I can live only wholly with you
or not at all."

345
00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:55.360
Good stuff.

346
00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:57.900
"Be calm my life, my all.

347
00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:00.910
Only by calm consideration
of our existence...

348
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.870
...can we achieve
our purpose to live together.

349
00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.450
Oh, continue to love me.
Never misjudge...

350
00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:09.580
...the most faithful heart of your beloved.

351
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:14.880
Ever thine. Ever mine. Ever ours."

352
00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.220
Have you ever written me a love letter?

353
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:22.850
Does a love fax count?

354
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.890
- When have I ever gotten a love fax?
- Oh, I'm sure my secretary sent you one...

355
00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.400
...at some point.
- Yeah.

356
00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:33.940
What can I tell you, baby?
It's not my style.

357
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:37.490
Besides, those guys had to write.
They were separated from their loves...

358
00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:41.320
...by wars
and hundreds and hundreds of miles.

359
00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:43.620
I'm right here.

360
00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.740
Hello.

361
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:51.290
- You make me very happy.
- Yeah, yeah. Put it in writing.

362
00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:57.130
With my mind prenuptially preoccupied,
I became delinquent with my library books.

363
00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:01.090
So now the tragic love stories
ofWuthering Heights and Love Story...

364
00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.390
...were going to cost me
more than a few tears.

365
00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:05.560
Excuse me, which way is the wedding?

366
00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:07.680
Up the stairs.

367
00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:20.780
It was perfect.

368
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.990
Big and I would be married
in the classic New York landmark...

369
00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.910
...that housed all the great love stories.

370
00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.870
Where is the waiter with the check?

371
00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.670
Jeez, Miranda, relax.
Magda hasn't even finished yet.

372
00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.460
I still have a brief to work on
when I get home.

373
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:43.180
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- I'll take him.

374
00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.430
Thank you, Magda.

375
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:49.140
We're gonna wash that beautiful face.
Come, darling.

376
00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:52.520
What?

377
00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:55.190
We can't let the hard-working nanny
finish her supper?

378
00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:58.980
I'm sorry, I'm exhausted.
Brady woke me up at 5 a.m.

379
00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:02.200
- Hey, he woke me up too.
- Yeah.

380
00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.160
We gotta stop letting Brady
come into our bed.

381
00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:11.370
You got milk on your top lip.

382
00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:14.330
What now?

383
00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:17.790
- It's like you're always criticizing me.
- I am not.

384
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:22.880
You wanna go through life with foam
on your lip and no one ever telling you?

385
00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.730
Anything you wanna tell me?

386
00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.690
Hm. Is there anything you wanna tell me?

387
00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:53.830
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Wait. Wait. Don't come already.

388
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.580
- Yeah.
- No, wait. Get on top.

389
00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:00.380
Let's just get it over with.

390
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:08.010
I mean, we gotta get up
in four and a half hours.

391
00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:12.680
We never have sex
and you wanna get it over with?

392
00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:21.770
- Steve, we have sex.
- When was the last time we had sex?

393
00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.530
Um...

394
00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.120
There was snow on the ground.

395
00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:39.290
- How often do you guys have sex?
- Sex.

396
00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.290
- Miranda, please.
What?

397
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:43.880
She's 3.
She doesn't know what it means.

398
00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:46.050
I'm 41 and I still don't know
what it means.

399
00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.470
I know, but she is repeating everything.

400
00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.810
If I'd known the girl talk was gonna be on
lockdown, I wouldn't have flown 3000 miles.

401
00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:55.600
No, we can talk.
Let's just not use that word.

402
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:59.770
Fine. How often do you guys...?

403
00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:01.650
- Color?
Thank you.

404
00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:06.150
Well, I can't color enough.
I could color all day every day.

405
00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.410
If I had my way,
I would use every crayon in my box.

406
00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:13.830
We get it. You love to color.

407
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:15.750
Why are you asking?

408
00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:21.130
Well, last night Steve and I were coloring,
and I was just about to...

409
00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:24.050
Come.
I'm sorry, there's no crayon equivalent.

410
00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:27.760
And he wanted to switch positions
and I said:

411
00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.340
"Let's just get it over with."

412
00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:35.520
- He kept trying to make it last longer.
- This is bad?

413
00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.520
- It is when you have a full-time job.
- I have a full-time job.

414
00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:41.520
You don't also have a 5-year-old,
play dates, PTA meetings...

415
00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:45.150
...and a mother-in-law in a rest home
with advancing Alzheimer's.

416
00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.530
We're just going through
a no-coloring phase.

417
00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:51.490
- It comes and goes, right?
Every couple is different.

418
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:54.370
Harry and I make love
two, three times a week.

419
00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:57.790
- Great, now I feel worse.
- Well, when was the last time for you?

420
00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:01.870
- Six months ago.
- Oh, my.

421
00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:05.170
It sounds long.

422
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.300
- But... But that's a dry spell.
- I bet it is.

423
00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:11.880
Hey, Carrie. What about you and Big?

424
00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:15.390
Come on. I told. Tell.

425
00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.760
Mm-mm.

426
00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:18.890
But I will tell you this.

427
00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:20.850
When Big colors...

428
00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.820
...he rarely stays inside the lines.

429
00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:28.480
Well, this has been very helpful.

430
00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:40.080
John?

431
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.130
- Hey.
- Come here.

432
00:27:57.310 --> 00:28:00.100
Totally outside the lines.

433
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:11.440
Well, send it to Smith Jerrod
at the office address.

434
00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.240
I gotta go. Something just came up.

435
00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:20.240
- I got a gift for you.
- So far, I like it.

436
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:30.050
How'd...?

437
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:33.760
Wait. That was you on the phone
at the auction.

438
00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:38.050
- I knew how much you wanted it.
- But I was gonna buy it for myself.

439
00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:40.310
Well, I wanted to give it to you.

440
00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.310
For our anniversary.

441
00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.480
We met five years ago today.

442
00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.310
Right.

443
00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.730
Do you like it?

444
00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:53.820
Well, just to be clear,
this is a ring with diamonds...

445
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:56.740
...it's not a diamond ring, right?
- Yeah.

446
00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:00.030
Well, in that case, I love it.

447
00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:03.580
It's my second favorite thing
I've ever found in there.

448
00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:10.000
Now, my gift is a little bit more oral.

449
00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:16.340
- Babe, I have to go to bed.
- Bed? It's 7:30.

450
00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:20.180
I have to be at the studio by 6 a.m.
And I need to get a workout in before that.

451
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:22.010
You see, this is how it starts.

452
00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:26.520
Next thing you know, we're only
having sex three or four times a week.

453
00:29:56.550 --> 00:30:00.510
And that is how Samantha learned
she had a new neighbor.

454
00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:04.310
From then on, night after night...

455
00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.060
...while Smith got his beauty sleep...

456
00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:13.730
...Samantha found something
more interesting to watch than TiVo.

457
00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:20.740
- Keep going.
- Okay.

458
00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:23.910
- Keep them closed.
- Okay.

459
00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:28.750
Okay. Open them.

460
00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.090
Double doors.

461
00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:35.710
So far, so good.

462
00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:48.230
Oh, my God.

463
00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:56.230
- Oh, you did me proud, mister.
- You like it?

464
00:30:57.610 --> 00:30:58.690
"Like it?"

465
00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:05.700
It's love at first sight.

466
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:08.080
Oh, my.

467
00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:11.460
Here. Wait.

468
00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:13.170
Hold this.

469
00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:23.800
Now I believe this is all really happening.

470
00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.810
I can't believe it sold so fast.

471
00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:29.850
- It's a sign.
- Yeah, it's a sign I priced it too low.

472
00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:34.650
Hey, that's the food. Will you buzz
them in? And money's on the table.

473
00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:38.150
I'm gonna get started on the closet.
I should be done in about 17 years.

474
00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.610
All right. Pink Post-it: Take.

475
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:45.070
Purple: Toss. Yellow: Storage.

476
00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.660
Oh, you're very good friends.

477
00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.380
Oh, my God.

478
00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:01.170
I can't believe it.
Lily, look who it is. Aunt Samantha.

479
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:07.180
- What are you doing here?
- A lot of shit went down in this place.

480
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:09.890
Attention must be paid.

481
00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.560
Ah.

482
00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:16.190
Really, champagne.

483
00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.200
- Remember this?
- Oh, yeah.

484
00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:28.660
While Samantha put on
The Best of the '80s...

485
00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:33.000
...I put on the worst.

486
00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:41.800
Banana clip.

487
00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:47.350
Yeah.

488
00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:49.560
Work it.

489
00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:53.310
Madonna.

490
00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:56.690
Whoo, whoo!

491
00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:06.740
No fun.

492
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:27.880
It took four friends three days...

493
00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:32.130
...to put 20 years into 38 boxes.

494
00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:57.170
While I run over
to see your mother tomorrow...

495
00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:00.300
...maybe you could take Brady
by the first birthday party alone.

496
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:05.140
And then I'll meet you at the twins, party,
and you can leave and be at the bar by 6.

497
00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.480
What's the matter?

498
00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:12.150
I had sex with someone else.

499
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:17.900
And you're so amazing...

500
00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:21.320
...and I don't know how
I could do that to you.

501
00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:25.200
You and I hadn't had sex
in a really long time and I...

502
00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:26.700
God.

503
00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:29.790
It didn't mean anything.
It just happened once.

504
00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.670
And it's been killing me.

505
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:35.500
It's killing you?

506
00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:36.920
It just happened.

507
00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:40.380
L... l...

508
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:42.390
l... l... I wasn't thinking.

509
00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:45.350
Do not follow me.

510
00:34:56.650 --> 00:34:58.690
Scout, off.

511
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.370
Miranda, it's still me.

512
00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:14.460
Is it?

513
00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:30.980
Steve. I just... I can't believe it.

514
00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.600
- That's what I said.
Yes, it's sad.

515
00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:36.860
But I'm not gonna make it any sadder
by staying at a bad hotel...

516
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:39.900
...while I look for a place.
Could you pass the salt?

517
00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:42.490
Plus, I have to be downtown
and close to Brooklyn.

518
00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:45.490
We're gonna keep Brady's life
as normal as we possibly can.

519
00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:48.660
I'm gonna have him on my days
and Steve will have him on his...

520
00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:51.580
...and Magda will shuttle
back and forth between.

521
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:54.750
Well, I don't really know
if this question is allowed...

522
00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.590
...but how is Steve handling this?

523
00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:59.670
Says he's devastated,
begs me to forgive him.

524
00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:02.470
It's not gonna happen.
I can barely even look at him.

525
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.760
Miranda, honey'
are you sure you wanna do this?

526
00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:07.680
It's just one time.
Anyone can have a slip.

527
00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:11.930
Even if I could get my mind around that
justification, it's the cheating part.

528
00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:16.270
The behind-my-back part, the violation
of the trust. That's what's killing me.

529
00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:27.910
Thank you for being you.

530
00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.670
Charlotte made love to Harry
four times that week.

531
00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:38.170
Okay. Wedding crunch time.
We need to get really serious here.

532
00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:42.300
Okay, not now.
I just got an e-mail from our contractor.

533
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:45.090
He's pushed the move-in date yet again.

534
00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.180
- I gotta write this guy and...
- No, No, no.

535
00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:51.140
No. Wedding before contractor, all right?

536
00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:56.020
Unless you're planning to invite him'
which would make the guest list 201.

537
00:36:57.730 --> 00:37:00.770
Two hundred?
Jesus, Carrie, it went up again?

538
00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:03.940
- It's the dress.
- You said 75 people.

539
00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:07.860
How can I explain this?

540
00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:11.240
Look...

541
00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.660
...you play poker, right?

542
00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:15.910
Well, the dress upped the ante.

543
00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.460
Hey.

544
00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:24.170
How you doing on your vows?

545
00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:29.010
A reminder. You'll be saying these in front
of a lot of people, so the pressure is on.

546
00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:31.100
All right, up. I have to finish this. Up.

547
00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.930
- Hey.
- I don't have time for this.

548
00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:37.560
- You're not taking it seriously.
- No, no, I'm not. It is a circus.

549
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:44.110
Two hundred people?

550
00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.530
Page Six?

551
00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:54.790
This is my third marriage.
How do you think that makes me look?

552
00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:06.380
I didn't know that was even an issue.

553
00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:13.430
So why didn't you say anything sooner?

554
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:18.060
- You wanted all of this.
- Well, yeah.

555
00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.810
- But don't you want...?
- I want you.

556
00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:22.610
That's what I want.

557
00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:27.190
I could have just gone down to city hall.

558
00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:49.840
I think it's too late for city hall now.

559
00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:54.010
Well, No, I wasn't suggesting that...

560
00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:55.510
I was just saying.

561
00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:01.270
See, that's the face...

562
00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.520
...l've been trying to avoid.

563
00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.110
Come here.

564
00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:16.370
You're a great man-friend.

565
00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:24.540
And soon,
it was the night before the big day.

566
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:28.760
There they are.

567
00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.900
Now, I know it's tradition
at the rehearsal dinner...

568
00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:54.870
...for the maid of honor to reveal
embarrassing things about the bride.

569
00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:59.910
But in our group, we never kiss and tell.

570
00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:05.210
- So I'd like to make a toast to the groom.
- There's a word he's heard before.

571
00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:11.550
- Who's that guy again?
- Karl. He's a partner at the firm.

572
00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:12.760
Karl's kind of a jerk.

573
00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:14.970
You know what they say,
three time's a charm.

574
00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:17.390
Hey, dickwad, I'm speaking.

575
00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:22.730
- Yeah, Samantha.
- Yeah.

576
00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:29.480
Now, there were times when we had
our doubts about this gorgeous man.

577
00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:34.110
But after careful observation
over the last hundred years...

578
00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.450
...my doubts are over.

579
00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:39.620
So here's to the groom...

580
00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:43.120
...a man who finally got "Carrie-d" away.

581
00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:45.330
Aww.

582
00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:46.790
Here's hoping, John.

583
00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.210
That guy is a jackass. Here.

584
00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:51.300
- Cheers.
- That was really nice. Thank you.

585
00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.590
There's nothing like
an illegal Cuban cigar...

586
00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:56.300
...after dinner, huh?
Exactly.

587
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:58.600
So that was quite a toast, Samantha.

588
00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.010
Well, you're quite a guy.

589
00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:01.970
Oh, my God, there's a cab.
Oh, yeah.

590
00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.140
- Hey, buddy, hold on.
- Get it.

591
00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:07.190
Steve.

592
00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:11.610
- I don't wanna bother you all.
- You're not bothering us.

593
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:14.690
But...

594
00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.990
...I need to talk to Miranda.

595
00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:21.120
Samantha, could you ask her
to come out?

596
00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:23.580
I don't wanna go in. It's a party and all.

597
00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:25.870
Sure.

598
00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:33.590
Hey. I haven't talked to you all night.

599
00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.340
Steve's here.

600
00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:41.890
They, re not poodles.
You know what I mean.

601
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:46.310
Hey, guys. Would you give us...?

602
00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:49.020
Yeah, sure, going in.

603
00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:54.030
You're all right?

604
00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:05.660
You didn't leave me any choice.
You won't return my calls.

605
00:42:05.830 --> 00:42:08.870
You only talk to me in front of the baby
and I can't say anything.

606
00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:12.420
What could you possibly have to say
that could make it any better?

607
00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:18.010
- Please. It was just that one time.
- You broke us!

608
00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:21.090
You broke us. What we had is broken.

609
00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:24.430
What the fuck is happening?

610
00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:34.400
I changed who I was for you.

611
00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:42.530
Hey.

612
00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:46.580
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not all right.

613
00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:52.000
You two are crazy to get married.
Marriage ruins everything.

614
00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:07.560
Hey. There you are.
I thought you'd skipped out on me.

615
00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:08.850
No.

616
00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:11.900
Well, the all-gal sleepover's
about to commence.

617
00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:20.400
Hey, is everything okay?

618
00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:23.110
Yeah. I'm just tired, I guess.

619
00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.620
All right. Well, go home and go to sleep.

620
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:28.660
But first give me a kiss good night
and make it a good one...

621
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.290
...because it's the last single-girl kiss.

622
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:39.800
- I always knew she would marry Big.
- Oh, you did not.

623
00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:42.300
- That's crazy.
- Yes, I did.

624
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:46.810
After every breakup I secretly thought'
"Nope. They belong together."

625
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:48.930
You thought that
after the second breakup?

626
00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:50.810
- Yup.
- After the fifteenth?

627
00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:53.940
Ha-ha. That's hilarious.
We broke up a lot.

628
00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:57.650
Yeah, but after the breakups
comes the hot make-up sex.

629
00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:04.160
Hey, you wanna get that? Open up.

630
00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:06.910
- Now say something.
- Sex.

631
00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:13.710
Are you sure she's not my child?

632
00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:16.540
- Hello?
- It's me.

633
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:19.130
Oh, my God, did you just hear Lily?

634
00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:22.050
- I need to talk.
- What?

635
00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:27.890
I'm sitting here
trying to write these vows and...

636
00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:31.350
Is this something we really wanna do?

637
00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:36.100
Hey, you know what? You guys, it's Big.
I'm gonna... I'm gonna take it.

638
00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:40.230
Get some sleep, groomie.

639
00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:47.200
- What's the matter?
- It's just...

640
00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:50.790
...everything is great as it is.

641
00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:54.540
- I don't wanna screw it up.
- You won't.

642
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:57.000
I screwed it up twice before.

643
00:44:58.250 --> 00:44:59.960
Here's the thing.

644
00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:05.840
This is me you're marrying tomorrow.
Me. It's nobody else.

645
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:09.970
- Yeah?
- And I'm marrying you.

646
00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:11.680
It's me and you.

647
00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:15.020
And do you wanna hear
the great news there?

648
00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:16.230
Yeah.

649
00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.230
We've both already done
everything we can to screw it up.

650
00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:24.570
- Is that a smile I'm hearing?
- Yeah.

651
00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:29.200
It sounds to me like you've got
a bit of writer's block on the vow front.

652
00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:30.490
Yeah.

653
00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:33.540
And I find, you know'
as a professional writer...

654
00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:37.580
...that it's best to just, you know...

655
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:41.420
...just stop thinking about it so much
and go to bed.

656
00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:43.630
And in the morning...

657
00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:47.050
- You'll know what to do.
- Exactly.

658
00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:50.350
And if not, then just write this:

659
00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:52.140
I will love you.

660
00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:54.430
Simple, to the point...

661
00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:58.900
...and I swear I won't even
try to take credit for it.

662
00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:03.320
So you're gonna go to bed now, right?

663
00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:07.700
Okay. Good night.

664
00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:10.950
I'll see you tomorrow. And hey...

665
00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:14.240
...it's me and you.

666
00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.900
Now, there's a bride.

667
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.120
Before we leave, we're gonna
pick up our flowers, right, girls?

668
00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:02.540
Miranda, you're gonna have the dahlias.
Samantha, you have the roses.

669
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:06.380
- And Charlotte...
We can take care of it.

670
00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:09.300
Hello?

671
00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:12.840
Could you put Carrie
on the phone, please?

672
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:15.680
Hello?

673
00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:24.400
Who let the dogs out?
Get these dogs out of here!

674
00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:28.230
That's all we need is the lift of a leg
on the train of a dress.

675
00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:30.780
Could you open this door, please?

676
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:33.820
- Wait, wait, hold it.
I'm trying to find out...

677
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:35.280
- Oh, my God.
Hey.

678
00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:37.660
- The girls are in this car.
- All of us together?

679
00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:40.790
All of you together.
Okay? Come on, lift it up. Let's go.

680
00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:42.830
Hey, it's Carrie. Leave me a message.

681
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.000
- See you then. Bye-bye.
Just so beautiful.

682
00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:52.840
Blue.
Yes, sir.

683
00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:56.300
- Red and black.
Okay, I'll see you there.

684
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:58.560
- Where's black?
- Oh, I'm coming, I'm coming.

685
00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:00.680
- You're following the red.
- I'm coming.

686
00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:03.310
Okay. Come on. Let's go.

687
00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.650
- Ready?
- Yeah, okay, you're in.

688
00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:07.020
Okay.

689
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:11.280
There's the bride. Look, she's dressed
like a princess, do you see?

690
00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:13.530
- Can you hold that?
- Oh, yes.

691
00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:15.110
Thank you. Okay.

692
00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:17.740
Come on, scootch over.

693
00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:23.250
It's like pushing a cream puff
through a keyhole.

694
00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:24.620
See you at the library.

695
00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:28.250
- Hey, it's Carrie. Leave me a message.
- Why haven't you called me back?

696
00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:32.090
Look, I really need to talk to you.
Call me as soon as you get this.

697
00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:37.600
No more wedding guests on these stairs,
understand? Bridal party only.

698
00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:39.010
Got it.

699
00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:42.850
We've got a problem. They're not here.

700
00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:45.810
- Thy, re probably stuck in traffic.
- Both of them?

701
00:48:52.110 --> 00:48:57.070
- Hey, it's Carrie. Leave me a message.
- I can't go in without you.

702
00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:00.280
Baby...

703
00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:06.710
...this whole bride-and-groom thing
has really got me thrown.

704
00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:14.170
I need to know that it's still us.

705
00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:18.340
Just you and me. Like you said.

706
00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.440
I was putting it on.
I know.

707
00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:26.980
Good job. Beautiful.

708
00:49:28.310 --> 00:49:31.570
Come on, baby.
Turn around, let me see you.

709
00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:36.950
You look so beautiful.

710
00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:47.250
It looks beautiful.

711
00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:49.290
It really does. It looks so beautiful.

712
00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:51.840
Oh, look at Mommy, here they come.

713
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.300
Easy does it.
We're here.

714
00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:56.550
The traffic was the worst.
57th Street was just...

715
00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:00.600
- It's okay.
Hello. You guys look great.

716
00:50:02.850 --> 00:50:06.680
- Okay, honey, let's go upstairs.
Ready. We're ready.

717
00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:09.980
He's not here.

718
00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:12.270
- Who's not here?
- The groom.

719
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:14.070
What's happening?

720
00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:19.860
- Big's not here.
- But we're 25 minutes late.

721
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:22.200
Well, did anybody call him?

722
00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:28.920
Well, give me a phone.
Somebody give me a phone.

723
00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:36.050
- All right, I don't know how to work this.
- Here, sweetie.

724
00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:37.760
Thank you.

725
00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:52.020
Hey, you know what?
Let me just look at your tie for a minute.

726
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:54.070
Hello.
- Are you okay?

727
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:55.610
I've been calling for an hour.

728
00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:59.280
- Why haven't you been answering?
- Because I don't know where my phone is.

729
00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:02.530
So, what's going on? Where are you?

730
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:06.200
I was out front. I just left.

731
00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:11.500
I can't do this.

732
00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:18.510
Oh, my God.

733
00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:25.220
Carrie? Carrie.

734
00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:32.480
- He's not coming. Oh, my God.
- What do you mean, "He's not coming"?

735
00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:37.320
Get me out of here.

736
00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:39.070
- Get me out of here!
- Go, go, go.

737
00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:42.360
- You take her, I'll take care of all of this.
All right, all right.

738
00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:43.950
Here we go.

739
00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:08.180
What the fuck am I doing?
Turn around, go back.

740
00:52:08.350 --> 00:52:09.890
It's a one-way street.

741
00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:12.690
By the time we go around the block'
she'll be gone.

742
00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:15.150
There's no one behind us. Turn around.

743
00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:25.870
- I think this is them.
- Pull over. Pull over.

744
00:52:27.330 --> 00:52:28.870
Carrie.

745
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Carrie. I freaked out for a minute'
but I'm ready now.

746
00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:44.340
Oh, God.

747
00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:49.850
I knew
you would do this! I knew it!

748
00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:53.020
- Carrie, I'm sorry.
- I am humiliated!

749
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:55.770
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry, Carrie.

750
00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:57.020
Come on. Come on.

751
00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:02.190
- Carrie, wait, I'm sorry. Carrie...
- No! No!

752
00:53:03.490 --> 00:53:05.200
Come on, we're gonna get in the car.

753
00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:08.450
It's all right, it's all right.

754
00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:31.810
Let's go, man. Move it.

755
00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:03.750
I thought I would still be in extreme pain.

756
00:54:06.970 --> 00:54:08.930
I feel nothing.

757
00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:14.060
I'd like some more nothing.

758
00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:21.730
Yes, I'm still jilted.

759
00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:27.110
What the hell got into him?
He was perfectly fine at the dinner.

760
00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:30.660
I knew it when he called last night.

761
00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:34.120
- I could tell.
- Then why didn't you say anything?

762
00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:39.040
I didn't wanna believe it. I di...

763
00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:42.460
I didn't even wanna say it out loud.

764
00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:48.090
- Now I have nowhere to live.
- You'll stay here.

765
00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:49.510
Forever.

766
00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:53.140
Maybe you should eat something.

767
00:54:54.310 --> 00:54:56.640
- Anyone? Hungry?
- No.

768
00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:01.690
I can never go back there again.
How am I gonna get my clothes?

769
00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:06.030
Oh, honey, I can hire people to do all that.
Anything you need.

770
00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:07.990
A hit man?

771
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:12.820
I have nothing to wear
but a wedding gown.

772
00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:16.290
You have your honeymoon clothes here.

773
00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:19.790
Well, there's the silver lining.

774
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:25.840
A honeymoon
at a romantic Mexican resort...

775
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.920
...that's prepaid on my credit card...

776
00:55:28.090 --> 00:55:30.550
...because I wanted to surprise
the man who jilted me.

777
00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:32.380
I can get you out of that.

778
00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:35.470
Worse comes to worse'
I'll say there was a death or something.

779
00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:37.350
Wasn't there?

780
00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:44.520
Keep those eyes closed.
Keep them closed.

781
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.120
Charlotte.

782
00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:02.080
Come here. Come here.

783
00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:07.920
I did something really bad, I think.

784
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:11.470
I said something to Big
at the rehearsal dinner.

785
00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:14.180
What do you mean?

786
00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:17.850
It was right after Steve showed up.
I was upset.

787
00:56:18.010 --> 00:56:21.730
Big came over to me'
and I said something like:

788
00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:24.650
"You're crazy to get married."

789
00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:27.360
It just came out.

790
00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:31.490
- Do you think it's totally the reason?
- No.

791
00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:34.660
Big has been weird
about marriage for years.

792
00:56:36.830 --> 00:56:40.330
- I keep thinking I should tell Carrie.
- No, No, no.

793
00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:43.790
This is a bad time to even mention it.

794
00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:49.590
No, no, no. Find another time later.

795
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:50.750
Uh-huh.

796
00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:54.880
Well, it turns out, I couldn't get her
out of the honeymoon, but I got us in.

797
00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:58.760
- What?
- I just booked us three seats on the flight.

798
00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:01.640
Mexico, here we come.

799
00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:04.850
I can't go to Mexico. I have a job.

800
00:57:13.070 --> 00:57:16.070
Jerrod. Smith Jerrod, with a J.

801
00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:20.120
That's right. Great, thank you.

802
00:57:21.450 --> 00:57:25.410
- Make sure that the car is there...
- We're here, I'll call you back later.

803
00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:29.500
Welcome to Mexico.

804
00:57:35.130 --> 00:57:36.720
Do you have wi-fi? Thanks.

805
00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:43.680
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
I'm waiting for a Mr. And Mrs. Preston.

806
00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:48.020
Honey, you'll be waiting a long time.
We'll talk.

807
00:57:54.490 --> 00:57:57.360
This will kill her.

808
00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:01.370
- Where is she?
- In the powder room.

809
00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:04.290
- Well, let's look around.
- Yeah.

810
00:58:34.550 --> 00:58:37.060
And this is a master suite.

811
00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:40.390
Oh, my God.

812
00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:42.730
Here.

813
00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:44.730
You get that side.

814
00:58:46.570 --> 00:58:48.730
Where are we gonna put these?

815
00:58:49.650 --> 00:58:53.740
Here. No more honeymoon stuff.
This is very important.

816
00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:01.830
Here she comes.

817
00:59:15.090 --> 00:59:16.850
It's going to be a gorgeous sunset.

818
00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:20.310
Close the shutters.

819
00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:28.770
All of them.

820
00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:51.590
Morning.

821
00:59:53.970 --> 00:59:55.470
Did I dream it?

822
01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:11.190
Carrie?

823
01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:14.780
It's dinnertime. You slept the whole day.

824
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:17.530
So?

825
01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:35.010
Honey? You have to eat a little breakfast.

826
01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:38.180
I'm tired.

827
01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:41.800
Well, eat something,
then you can go back to sleep.

828
01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:18.760
- Oh, thank you, Paulo.
- Sure.

829
01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:26.850
With all this gorgeous fresh food, you're
gonna eat that pudding crap the entire trip?

830
01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:29.560
It's the only thing in the pantry
that's totally safe.

831
01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:33.520
See? "Made in Poughkeepsie."
I didn't wanna chance it.

832
01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:35.440
It's a five-star resort.

833
01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:37.820
It's Mexico.

834
01:01:46.290 --> 01:01:47.540
Carrie.

835
01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:51.250
Is there coffee?

836
01:01:52.290 --> 01:01:55.040
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

837
01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:04.550
The sun feels nice.

838
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:10.520
Jesus, honey, wax much?

839
01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:13.860
What? I didn't know
I was gonna be wearing a bathing suit.

840
01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:16.980
- What are you talking about?
- I forgot to wax.

841
01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:20.950
- Since when, 1998?
I've had other things on my mind.

842
01:02:21.110 --> 01:02:23.700
I could be on death row
and not have that situation.

843
01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:26.950
Well, when you're married,
you have a different set of priorities.

844
01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.750
Oh, honey, don't blame marriage.

845
01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:31.790
This one's married and
she's not growing a national forest.

846
01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:35.840
How do you even cross your legs?
Let me make you a spa appointment.

847
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.630
Any thicker,
and you won't be able to find it.

848
01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:42.930
So, what, it's my fault?

849
01:02:43.090 --> 01:02:46.220
I let the sex go out of my marriage.
I deserve what I got?

850
01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:50.100
- Thanks for understanding.
- Honey, I'm sorry. That's not what l...

851
01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:51.890
I'm fine.

852
01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.820
Hey, let's go down to the hotel
for dinner tonight.

853
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:07.780
- Really?
- Yeah.

854
01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:10.660
I gotta do something
to pull me out of my "Mexi-coma."

855
01:03:10.830 --> 01:03:13.410
Oh, honey, you made a little joke.

856
01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:15.500
Good for you.

857
01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:17.500
Yeah.

858
01:03:33.850 --> 01:03:38.020
- My name is Felix, I'll be your server.
- Felix, we'll start with cuatro margaritas.

859
01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:40.400
Oh, No, I'm not drinking.
Just bottled water.

860
01:03:40.570 --> 01:03:42.820
- I'll drink hers.
- May I have your room numbers?

861
01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:48.200
We're staying in one of the private houses.
Uh, number 3.

862
01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:49.950
Very good, Mrs. Preston.

863
01:03:54.790 --> 01:03:56.460
That was like taking a bullet.

864
01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:04.470
Charlotte has pudding in her Prada.

865
01:04:10.810 --> 01:04:13.270
- Will I ever laugh again?
- Yes.

866
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:17.150
- When?
- When something is really, really funny.

867
01:04:20.110 --> 01:04:23.900
Thank God for that mariachi band
or I'd be able to hear my own thoughts.

868
01:04:25.450 --> 01:04:27.860
Fabulous. And keep them coming.

869
01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:30.870
Thanks.

870
01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:38.040
Thank you.

871
01:04:44.090 --> 01:04:46.800
He couldn't get out of the car.

872
01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:50.720
After 10 years
of what he already put me through...

873
01:04:50.890 --> 01:04:55.060
...he couldn't make the effort
and get out of the car.

874
01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:57.190
I made the effort.

875
01:04:57.350 --> 01:04:59.150
I put a bird on my head.

876
01:04:59.310 --> 01:05:00.860
- Is that what that was?
- Yeah.

877
01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:03.570
- I thought it was feathers.
- It was a bird.

878
01:05:03.730 --> 01:05:07.070
- It was beautiful.
Beautiful.

879
01:05:07.450 --> 01:05:09.610
He's a bad guy.

880
01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:12.870
Always was.

881
01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:16.950
- Bad guys do bad things.
- And good guys do bad things.

882
01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:20.040
The good guys screw you
and the bad guys screw you.

883
01:05:20.210 --> 01:05:22.290
The rest of them
don't know how to screw you.

884
01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:25.590
- Trust me, I've done the legwork.
After everything I know...

885
01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:30.130
...after 20 years of
everything we've learned...

886
01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:34.220
...I threw it all away for the thrill of
putting his name on the honeymoon suite.

887
01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.980
If I met me now, I wouldn't know me.

888
01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:41.900
As long as we're going down this road...

889
01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:46.530
...I can't believe
that my life revolves around a man.

890
01:05:46.690 --> 01:05:49.030
On what planet
did I allow that to happen?

891
01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.280
But you love him.

892
01:05:50.450 --> 01:05:54.160
Does that mean saying his name
50 times more a day than I say my own?

893
01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:58.700
Does it mean worrying about him
and his needs before me and mine?

894
01:05:58.870 --> 01:06:01.250
Is it all about the other person?
Is that love?

895
01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:04.790
- No, that's marriage.
- Even this ring.

896
01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:06.460
I wanted to buy this for myself.

897
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:08.880
That meant something to me'
to be able to do that.

898
01:06:09.050 --> 01:06:12.680
- And then he buys it for me.
- Because he knew how much you loved it.

899
01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:16.760
Yes, but now every time I look down at it,
I see him not me.

900
01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:21.640
- Is every...?
- We'll take another round.

901
01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:24.980
- Another?
- Relax. We're on vacation.

902
01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:26.900
Technically, we're on my honeymoon.

903
01:06:27.070 --> 01:06:29.990
No, I think we're on their honeymoon.

904
01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:33.910
Yeah, it's all so hot three days in.

905
01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:44.960
"Mailbox full." Yea, I'll bet it is.

906
01:06:45.130 --> 01:06:47.420
- There's no time like the present.
No.

907
01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:50.170
I'm not ready to face it all yet.

908
01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:54.140
Hey. I'm going for a run
and then to the gym for Pilates.

909
01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:56.350
Anybody wanna...?

910
01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:59.890
- Hi.
- Hey, good news.

911
01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:02.100
I got an e-mail
from your buyer's attorney.

912
01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:05.900
Thy, re willing to sell you back
your old apartment at the escalated price...

913
01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:08.900
...and "are willing to vacate
by the time you return...

914
01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:11.110
...pending an additional financial offer."

915
01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:14.950
Well, apparently you can go home again,
but it'll cost you.

916
01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:17.830
- Let's work on getting your things there.
Wow...

917
01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:20.910
...you two could rule the world.

918
01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:24.120
After her workout,
Charlotte couldn't help but think...

919
01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:26.210
...how truly blessed she was.

920
01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:30.090
This week had made her feel more grateful
than ever for her happy marriage.

921
01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:34.590
And just for a second, while picturing
her loved ones at home in New York...

922
01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:38.930
...she forgot where she was
and opened her mouth.

923
01:08:01.330 --> 01:08:02.370
Hello, miss.

924
01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:08.750
- Have you had that happen?
Not recently.

925
01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:10.630
Sweetie, what's...?

926
01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:12.710
It's locked, she's mopping.

927
01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.470
Try the...

928
01:08:23.350 --> 01:08:25.770
- Did you just...?
- Shut up, shut up, shut up!

929
01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:27.940
And just like that...

930
01:08:28.110 --> 01:08:30.150
...Charlotte "Poughkeepsied"
in her pants.

931
01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:35.900
Oh, my God.

932
01:08:39.410 --> 01:08:40.740
Miranda was right.

933
01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:45.790
When something was really,
really funny, I laughed.

934
01:08:46.830 --> 01:08:48.750
Oh, my God.

935
01:09:13.530 --> 01:09:14.900
First message:

936
01:09:15.070 --> 01:09:20.200
Received Saturday,
September 20th, 12:30 p.m.

937
01:09:20.370 --> 01:09:23.780
Carrie, call me.
I need to talk to you before...

938
01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:19.670
There was no better time I could think of
to hire an assistant.

939
01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:23.300
Um, no. I do not lift boxes.

940
01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:28.560
Yeah, definitely, no.
I would love a career in fashion.

941
01:10:28.730 --> 01:10:30.680
Oh.

942
01:10:31.730 --> 01:10:33.600
This is not nonfat.

943
01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:35.360
Oh.

944
01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:39.570
I love your books. Your shit's brilliant.

945
01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:41.320
Cathy?

946
01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:45.030
- You seem drunk.
- Little bit.

947
01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:47.030
Never made it to bed last night.

948
01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:49.580
But I type like a motherfucker!

949
01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:51.750
I have a degree in finance
from Princeton...

950
01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:54.580
...and I've been assistant to a V.P.
At Merrill Lynch.

951
01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:59.880
That's impressive. And, Paul'
why do you think you're right for this job?

952
01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:12.350
- So you're from St. Louis?
- That's right. Louise from St. Louis.

953
01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:14.440
And you have a degree
in computer science?

954
01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:17.610
- Yes, that's correct.
- Well, good for you. I can barely text.

955
01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:23.320
- Have you ever been a personal assistant?
- No, but I'm the oldest of six kids...

956
01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:25.700
...so I'm sure I can handle
anything you got.

957
01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:28.700
- Wow. Six kids, what's that like?
- Crowded.

958
01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:32.290
I had to move to New York just to
get some room. Where did I end up?

959
01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:35.080
In a one-bedroom apartment
with three roommates.

960
01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:38.750
Well, aside from the space issue'
why'd you move to New York?

961
01:11:40.670 --> 01:11:41.960
To fall in love.

962
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:46.840
- What? That's corny, right?
- No.

963
01:11:47.010 --> 01:11:51.020
No, no, it's... It's just very honest.

964
01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:56.230
I don't think that I've heard
anybody say that in a very long time.

965
01:11:56.770 --> 01:11:58.110
Well...

966
01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:03.360
So Louise from St. Louis,
I just have one more question.

967
01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:04.570
Okay.

968
01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:07.110
How does an unemployed girl
with three roommates...

969
01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:09.830
...afford the Patchwork Denim Bowley
Louis Vuitton bag?

970
01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:14.580
It's rented. Bag Borrow or Steal?
It's like Netflix for purses.

971
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:18.540
- How can I not know about this?
- Girl, stick with me. I'll hook you up.

972
01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:26.590
And did she hook me up.

973
01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:31.140
Hi. This is Louise.
I'm calling for Carrie Bradshaw.

974
01:12:31.770 --> 01:12:35.850
Yes, she received your invitation,
but she will be unable to attend.

975
01:12:36.020 --> 01:12:37.650
Thank you.

976
01:12:41.730 --> 01:12:43.780
Put that over there.

977
01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:46.740
After only three days...

978
01:12:46.910 --> 01:12:51.580
...I began to think of her
as Saint Louise from St. Louis.

979
01:12:52.290 --> 01:12:54.500
Ain't nothing in there for you.

980
01:12:55.410 --> 01:12:58.500
And as I moved back
into my old apartment...

981
01:12:58.670 --> 01:13:01.630
...Miranda searched for a new one,
downtown.

982
01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:04.760
You see the Chinese writing?
Yeah.

983
01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:08.180
New York magazine says this is
the new up-and-coming neighborhood.

984
01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:12.140
- Okay, maybe down that way?
- Maybe you come home.

985
01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:16.270
Look, white guy with a baby.

986
01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:20.100
Wherever he's going'
that's where we need to be.

987
01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:22.360
Come on.

988
01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:28.410
I lived here before.
Thia used to be all-Ukrainian area.

989
01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:30.280
A U-Haul.

990
01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.450
Coming or going?

991
01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:36.170
- Going. Oh, boy. I'm gonna check it out.
- Okay.

992
01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:37.580
Wait down here, okay?

993
01:13:37.770 --> 01:13:41.980
And there in old Ukrainia,
Miranda found her new apartment.

994
01:13:42.150 --> 01:13:44.900
- Hi. I'm interested in the apartment upstairs.
Yeah.

995
01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:46.880
"And there they remained
for the rest of their days...

996
01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:48.890
...for the birds
were constantly on guard...

997
01:13:49.050 --> 01:13:52.470
...and the women could not so much
as step one foot out the door.

998
01:13:52.890 --> 01:13:57.440
And Cinderella and the prince
lived happily ever after."

999
01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:07.490
You know that this is just a fairy tale,
right, sweetheart?

1000
01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:10.990
I mean, things don't always
happen like this in real life.

1001
01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:15.960
- I just think you should know that now.
- Again.

1002
01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:18.960
And another one bites the dust.

1003
01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:21.130
- Hi.
Hi.

1004
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:23.550
Mommy's home.

1005
01:14:24.170 --> 01:14:26.550
Thanks for watching Lily
while I went to the doctor.

1006
01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:30.850
- Oh, sure. Everything okay?
- Mm-hm.

1007
01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:35.430
- I'm pregnant.
- How?

1008
01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:40.270
You know how people always say
that when you stop trying, it can happen?

1009
01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:43.770
And my doctor says that she knows
other couples who have adopted...

1010
01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:46.110
...and then they get pregnant.

1011
01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:50.070
- Sweetie.
- Carrie, I'm pregnant.

1012
01:14:51.870 --> 01:14:55.750
I guess in certain houses,
fairy tales do come true.

1013
01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:00.290
Oh, that was really hot.

1014
01:15:01.670 --> 01:15:06.090
- You seem kind of distant.
- Distant? You're still in me.

1015
01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:17.850
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- When have I ever wanted to talk about it?

1016
01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:21.440
Okay. I'll talk about it.

1017
01:15:21.610 --> 01:15:23.940
Your best friends got screwed over
by their guys.

1018
01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:26.530
How could you not be distant?

1019
01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.530
It's more than that.

1020
01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:36.450
Lately, I haven't been feeling
a connection to...

1021
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:38.790
- What, me?
- No.

1022
01:15:39.290 --> 01:15:44.710
To it, here. I have no real connection
to our life here.

1023
01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:47.590
What life here? Seriously.

1024
01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.050
All I do is work...

1025
01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:51.630
...and you run off to New York
every chance you get.

1026
01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:56.060
Well, not every chance I get.
Only for the A-list things.

1027
01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:59.310
And my managing you, it's...
It's getting to be too much.

1028
01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:01.230
I'm starting to resent it.

1029
01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:03.980
For the last two years'
it's been all about you.

1030
01:16:04.150 --> 01:16:07.320
Well, for the first three years,
it was all about you.

1031
01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:10.610
I know. That was so much more fun.

1032
01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:14.530
Carrie Bradshaw's web page is a mess.

1033
01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:16.870
Interesting. So is Carrie Bradshaw.

1034
01:16:18.030 --> 01:16:22.620
Hey, when are we gonna get to the really
important stuff, like unpacking my closet?

1035
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:25.710
One thing at a time. You ever gonna
answer any of these e-mails?

1036
01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:27.460
- Yes.
- When?

1037
01:16:28.670 --> 01:16:30.420
- Now?
- Okay.

1038
01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:34.130
- Well, I'll read and you tell me what to do.
- Okay.

1039
01:16:34.510 --> 01:16:38.890
Who's john@jjpny.com?

1040
01:16:39.850 --> 01:16:43.390
Oh, shit. That's him, right?

1041
01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:56.820
Delete.

1042
01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:02.620
And isn't there some cyberspace place
that you can send those...

1043
01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:06.210
...so that I never have to see
an e-mail from him ever again?

1044
01:17:07.170 --> 01:17:08.920
Do that, please.

1045
01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:13.590
You sure you wanna end
all communication with him?

1046
01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:15.260
Mm-hm.

1047
01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:21.720
Okay. Great.

1048
01:17:24.270 --> 01:17:26.100
I can't believe you're even dressing up.

1049
01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:29.770
All the parents in Brady's school
dress up. It's fun.

1050
01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:34.110
Fun thought up by a group of non-working
mothers with nothing else to do all day.

1051
01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:39.280
All right, what do they got?
Witch and sexy kitten.

1052
01:17:39.450 --> 01:17:43.790
That's it. The only two choices
for women, witch and sexy kitten.

1053
01:17:43.950 --> 01:17:46.080
You just said a mouthful there, sister.

1054
01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:50.460
Maybe I should wear this and
a briefcase, and go as myself.

1055
01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:53.630
I got an e-mail from Big.

1056
01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:55.970
"I don't know what to say."

1057
01:17:56.130 --> 01:18:01.100
- U, then don't send an e-mail.
- What were you expecting?

1058
01:18:01.850 --> 01:18:05.220
And in the subject box, two words:

1059
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:08.640
- "I'm sorry."
- Ugh.

1060
01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:11.150
Steve is all about the "I'm sorry."

1061
01:18:11.310 --> 01:18:14.070
"I'm sorry" e-mails,
"I'm sorry" voice mails...

1062
01:18:14.230 --> 01:18:16.780
..."I'm sorry" flowers, "I'm sorry" cards.

1063
01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:20.860
How about, don't do anything
to be "I'm sorry" for?

1064
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:23.410
Well, maybe he's sorry.

1065
01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:25.910
Well, maybe so is Big.

1066
01:18:26.250 --> 01:18:27.500
Point taken.

1067
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:31.380
Hey, you're scaring the women.

1068
01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:35.340
It's gonna take a little more than that
to scare me after what I've been through.

1069
01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:40.510
I still cannot believe this happened to me.
I mean, l... I know it happened.

1070
01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:45.850
But I just... I can't believe it happened.

1071
01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:53.020
I lay awake at night going over
every detail of that last week in my head.

1072
01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:59.280
Carrie, there's a detail about that last week
I've been meaning to tell you.

1073
01:18:59.450 --> 01:19:02.530
- At the rehearsal dinner...
- And then I saw it.

1074
01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:07.040
The only thing scary enough to scare me
after what I'd been through.

1075
01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:10.080
You look great.
You look amazing. So that's the worst of it.

1076
01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:11.460
Wait, wait, wait.

1077
01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:14.880
What does it say there
in the editor's note?

1078
01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:18.300
"The wedding of Carrie Bradshaw
and John James Preston was canceled...

1079
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:21.680
...as this issue went to press.
Bradshaw is..."

1080
01:19:23.890 --> 01:19:26.100
Bradshaw is what?

1081
01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:28.560
Wait...

1082
01:19:30.810 --> 01:19:34.810
"Bradshaw is still single
and living in New York City."

1083
01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:42.950
I didn't wanna buy it...

1084
01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:46.250
...but I figured it was
one less Vogue in New York.

1085
01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:09.990
Louise.

1086
01:20:12.370 --> 01:20:15.540
Oh, my Lord. I didn't even recognize you.

1087
01:20:15.710 --> 01:20:18.580
That's the point. My head's
in the Witness Protection Program.

1088
01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:20.840
I'm feeling that look on you though.

1089
01:20:21.010 --> 01:20:25.630
- And I am feeling that Chanel on you.
- Mine till Tuesday.

1090
01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:31.220
- All right, so...
- Here. Time to rejoin the world.

1091
01:20:31.390 --> 01:20:33.220
Already?

1092
01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:40.520
- Your new number, area code 347-85...
- Ho... Ho... Hold it.

1093
01:20:40.770 --> 01:20:42.440
347?

1094
01:20:42.610 --> 01:20:46.360
Oh, no. No, I'm a 917 gal,
always have been.

1095
01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:49.530
I tried. It's no longer available.

1096
01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:51.120
Now you're 347.

1097
01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:52.830
Samantha Jones.

1098
01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.250
Carrie Bradshaw. Or I used to be.

1099
01:20:56.420 --> 01:20:57.670
Talk to me.

1100
01:20:58.250 --> 01:21:02.050
I'm a 347 area code. How awful is that?

1101
01:21:02.210 --> 01:21:04.170
347 is the new New York.

1102
01:21:04.340 --> 01:21:08.430
Well, I want the old New York
with my old 917 and my old will to live.

1103
01:21:08.590 --> 01:21:12.350
Old New York, new New York.
Honey, at least it's New York.

1104
01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:15.680
Another hard thing about being in L. A:

1105
01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:18.060
My sex-on-a-stick next-door neighbor.

1106
01:21:18.230 --> 01:21:20.770
- I can't stop looking at him.
- Looking?

1107
01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:26.110
Just looking. After seeing Steve's face
at the rehearsal dinner, I could never...

1108
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:30.110
Oh, but you should see this guy.
Every night...

1109
01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:32.950
...sex with a different partner. He's like...

1110
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:38.290
...me five years ago.
- Yeah. When I was a 917.

1111
01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:41.540
I mean, what's the point
of having a hot guy next door...

1112
01:21:41.710 --> 01:21:44.300
...if you can't have sex with him?

1113
01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:48.300
We agreed that no one else from the show
but Smith was going to be on the cover.

1114
01:21:49.550 --> 01:21:51.640
Well, get back to me.

1115
01:21:57.230 --> 01:21:58.310
Hey.

1116
01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:30.010
And in an effort to stay out of the house
and out of trouble...

1117
01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:32.680
...Samantha went shopping.

1118
01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:37.180
Rescue a puppy today?

1119
01:22:45.190 --> 01:22:49.740
- She needs a good home. Interested?
- No.

1120
01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:53.820
And just as Samantha convinced herself
that the dog wasn't for her...

1121
01:22:57.660 --> 01:23:00.710
She's been fixed'
but she hasn't lost the urge.

1122
01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:12.880
And because Samantha
couldn't get off...

1123
01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:15.680
...she got things.

1124
01:23:28.030 --> 01:23:31.240
What would happen if these
were to magically disappear?

1125
01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:35.410
- Yeah, I know where you live.
- For a pair like this, I could move.

1126
01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:38.580
Wait, Carrie, not that one.

1127
01:23:44.370 --> 01:23:46.080
Do you want me to get rid of it?

1128
01:23:48.050 --> 01:23:49.670
No.

1129
01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:52.380
No, it's too beautiful.

1130
01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:55.760
I'll just...

1131
01:23:55.930 --> 01:23:58.800
...bury it deep in the back...

1132
01:23:58.970 --> 01:24:01.100
...like I did my feelings.

1133
01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:05.770
- Do you miss him?
- Every day.

1134
01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:09.150
It's weird...

1135
01:24:10.110 --> 01:24:12.610
...I haven't cried very much at all.

1136
01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:14.780
I don't know, maybe...

1137
01:24:15.490 --> 01:24:19.200
Maybe you're only allotted
a certain amount of tears per man...

1138
01:24:19.370 --> 01:24:21.290
...and I used mine up.

1139
01:24:21.450 --> 01:24:23.790
Yeah, I know how you feel.

1140
01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:27.460
Because my St. Louis boyfriend
broke up with me last year...

1141
01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:29.540
...and I miss him all the time.

1142
01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:34.800
Suddenly, it dawned on me. There
were two broken hearts in my walk-in.

1143
01:24:38.050 --> 01:24:41.640
Louise, we need a cocktail.
Grab your rental.

1144
01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:45.140
And it threw me so hard.

1145
01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:48.310
Because, you know, I thought Will...

1146
01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:50.150
That's his name.

1147
01:24:50.610 --> 01:24:54.900
- I thought he was the love of my life.
- Well, what happened?

1148
01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:59.320
He said he loved me and all,
but he didn't think that I was the one.

1149
01:25:00.830 --> 01:25:05.660
That shit hurt. But, you know, whatever.

1150
01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:08.790
- I'm not gonna give up on love.
- Good.

1151
01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:11.290
Love is the thing, you know.

1152
01:25:14.090 --> 01:25:15.130
You see that?

1153
01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:20.180
That's love.
And I'm bringing it to me all day long.

1154
01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:23.680
Excuse me.

1155
01:25:28.650 --> 01:25:32.360
Oh, I remember that smile.
Who's the guy?

1156
01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:35.690
Someone I just met.
He wants me to meet him for drinks.

1157
01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:38.860
At 11:30? Oh, that's a booty call.

1158
01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:42.620
No, it's not.
He's a waiter, he just got off work.

1159
01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:47.040
Louise. Now, I may not get texts,
I may not send texts, but trust me.

1160
01:25:47.210 --> 01:25:50.370
The subtext of that text? Booty.

1161
01:25:51.630 --> 01:25:54.630
But if he meets me,
then it's not a booty call, right?

1162
01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:00.470
All right, then. Enjoy yourself.

1163
01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:02.390
That's what your 20s are for.

1164
01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:05.350
Your 30s are to learn the lessons.

1165
01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:08.100
Your 40s are to pay for the drinks.

1166
01:26:08.690 --> 01:26:12.400
Well, in that case, I'll take another one.

1167
01:26:14.190 --> 01:26:16.190
It's all about the desk.

1168
01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:19.400
If I find the desk, the writing will come.
And it better come...

1169
01:26:19.570 --> 01:26:23.620
...because I'm using my new book advance
to pay the fancy decorator.

1170
01:26:24.910 --> 01:26:29.750
I think it is so great that you're
redoing your entire apartment.

1171
01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:32.330
Yeah, well, out with the old and...

1172
01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:36.090
...oh, in with the overpriced.

1173
01:26:39.090 --> 01:26:43.930
Hey. Harry called me and
mentioned that you're not running.

1174
01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:48.470
- Why'd he do that?
- Because he loves you and he's concerned.

1175
01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:50.770
There's nothing to be concerned about.

1176
01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:55.690
Well, did...? Did the doctor say
that it's not safe or something?

1177
01:26:56.570 --> 01:26:59.610
No. She said because
I'm already a runner, it's fine.

1178
01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:02.360
So then, why are you not...?

1179
01:27:02.530 --> 01:27:04.780
Because I'm afraid
something bad is gonna happen.

1180
01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:08.790
- It's a miracle I'm even pregnant.
- Okay.

1181
01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:12.750
I have everything I ever wanted.

1182
01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:15.290
I am so happy that I'm terrified.

1183
01:27:15.790 --> 01:27:20.800
Nobody gets everything that they want.
Look at you. Look at Miranda.

1184
01:27:21.550 --> 01:27:23.970
You're good people
and look at what happened to you.

1185
01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:26.430
Of course something bad
is gonna happen to me.

1186
01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:28.140
Sweetie...

1187
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:31.020
...you shit your pants this year.

1188
01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:32.310
Maybe you're done.

1189
01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:39.650
You run every day, that's what you do.

1190
01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:43.650
You can't stop being who you are
because you're afraid, right?

1191
01:27:45.490 --> 01:27:46.820
All right.

1192
01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:50.580
Okay. Here we go.

1193
01:27:52.410 --> 01:27:54.080
Okay.

1194
01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:01.550
And as the last
of the autumn leaves fell away...

1195
01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:04.180
...so did Charlotte's fear.

1196
01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:11.560
By the time the first snow fell,
Charlotte got her stride back.

1197
01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:22.610
Are you sure you don't want me
to R.S.V.P. To any of these holiday parties?

1198
01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:25.400
No, I am perfectly happy
spending time alone.

1199
01:28:25.570 --> 01:28:27.910
You sure?
Because this looks like a good one.

1200
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:31.370
Go home. Seriously,
you're gonna miss your plane, go.

1201
01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:35.580
Okay. But first...

1202
01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:40.800
Merry Christmas.

1203
01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:46.470
- You didn't have to.
- It's just something silly.

1204
01:28:48.850 --> 01:28:50.260
Oh.

1205
01:28:50.810 --> 01:28:54.310
- Oh, Louise from St. Louis.
- You said you never saw it.

1206
01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:56.890
Well, jeez.

1207
01:28:57.060 --> 01:28:58.980
Now I feel bad.

1208
01:28:59.150 --> 01:29:02.690
If I had known
we were exchanging gifts...

1209
01:29:06.450 --> 01:29:09.280
...I would have bought you one
two weeks ago...

1210
01:29:09.450 --> 01:29:12.030
...and hidden it here.

1211
01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:20.130
- That is not what I think it is.
- I don't know, open it.

1212
01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:34.930
Oh, my God.

1213
01:29:35.230 --> 01:29:37.350
My very own Louis Vuitton?

1214
01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:40.350
That's right. No more rental for you.

1215
01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:43.770
Look who's home from the big city.

1216
01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:48.450
It was the best money I'd ever spent.

1217
01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:52.450
New Year's Eve and a cup of noodles.

1218
01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:04.300
So you remember
what you're gonna say at midnight?

1219
01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:07.630
- Happy New Year.
- Yeah.

1220
01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:10.630
Except you're gonna say it
much more excited than that.

1221
01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:16.100
- You're gonna say, "Happy New Year!"
- Happy New Year.

1222
01:30:16.270 --> 01:30:20.810
Yeah. And you say that
and then you kiss.

1223
01:30:28.650 --> 01:30:30.200
All right.

1224
01:30:30.860 --> 01:30:32.870
- All ready to go, B-boy?
- Yeah.

1225
01:30:33.030 --> 01:30:36.040
Did you remember to pack
the Batman that Santa brought you?

1226
01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:37.580
I think it's in the kitchen.

1227
01:30:37.750 --> 01:30:39.830
Oh, you gotta have the new Batman, huh?

1228
01:30:47.710 --> 01:30:49.920
You got plans with the girls?

1229
01:30:50.090 --> 01:30:51.380
Um...

1230
01:30:51.550 --> 01:30:54.430
We're all kind of staying in tonight.

1231
01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:59.310
Would you like to
come out and eat with us?

1232
01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:03.850
We could go someplace
on your side of the bridge.

1233
01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:06.860
No. Thank you.

1234
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:13.860
Miranda, I never meant to hurt you.

1235
01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:24.380
Batman.
- Oh, there he is. Batman.

1236
01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:26.210
- Okay.
- Okay.

1237
01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:28.050
- Put your hat on.
- Yeah.

1238
01:31:28.210 --> 01:31:31.220
- It's snowing out.
- Here you go.

1239
01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:34.130
I'm gonna bring Batman.
Okay.

1240
01:31:34.300 --> 01:31:38.140
Happy New Year.

1241
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:40.520
Kiss.

1242
01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:53.740
All right, I'll see you tomorrow.

1243
01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:58.580
This is my new...

1244
01:32:01.410 --> 01:32:03.210
You know what we're gonna do?

1245
01:32:03.370 --> 01:32:06.580
We're gonna light a firecracker
at midnight.

1246
01:33:16.210 --> 01:33:18.170
- Hello?
So I thought...

1247
01:33:18.330 --> 01:33:20.420
...that one of the perks
of having a family...

1248
01:33:20.590 --> 01:33:24.340
...was that you didn't have to spend
New Year's Eve alone with Chinese food.

1249
01:33:24.510 --> 01:33:27.010
I am alone with Chinese food.

1250
01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:31.560
- I was asleep.
- Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

1251
01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:35.430
No, no, that's okay. Where's Brady?

1252
01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:39.310
- It's Steve's night.
- Oh. Right.

1253
01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:44.230
- Don't wake up. Go... Go back to sleep.
- No, it's okay.

1254
01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:46.900
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

1255
01:33:47.070 --> 01:33:49.110
I got all choked up...

1256
01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:52.830
...watching stupid New Year's Eve stuff
alone on TV.

1257
01:33:52.990 --> 01:33:56.830
- You want me to come over?
- I'm all the way downtown.

1258
01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.670
No, I can... You know, I can...
I grab a cab.

1259
01:34:00.670 --> 01:34:04.420
On New Year's? No way.
I'm... I'm... I'm fine.

1260
01:34:04.590 --> 01:34:07.010
Really. I just...
I just wanted to talk a little.

1261
01:34:07.180 --> 01:34:10.760
Go back to sleep. I'll...
I'll see you next year.

1262
01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:13.640
- Good night.
- Good night.

1263
01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:53.140
Good one.

1264
01:34:59.230 --> 01:35:01.810
- It's almost time.
- Champagne?

1265
01:35:12.110 --> 01:35:14.990
Oh, my God. Thank God you're here.

1266
01:36:48.290 --> 01:36:50.920
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

1267
01:36:51.260 --> 01:36:53.210
You're not alone.

1268
01:36:57.430 --> 01:37:00.310
Happy New Year.

1269
01:37:45.180 --> 01:37:47.350
- A young child that perhaps they've...
- Oh!

1270
01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:49.400
- Hey, easy there, girl.
- You all right?

1271
01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:50.610
Yeah. Thanks.

1272
01:37:50.770 --> 01:37:53.980
Three months driving in L.A.
And I forgot how to use my fucking legs.

1273
01:37:54.150 --> 01:37:55.900
Every spring, the women of New York...

1274
01:37:56.070 --> 01:38:00.490
...leave the foolish choices of their past
behind and look forward to the future.

1275
01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:02.830
This is known as Fashion Week.

1276
01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:05.040
Excuse me. Hi.

1277
01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:07.160
Oh, there we are.

1278
01:38:07.750 --> 01:38:11.670
- We're in the front row?
- I had to pull some strings.

1279
01:38:12.210 --> 01:38:14.300
- Very nice.
- I should go thank them.

1280
01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:18.470
Decide where we're gonna go for lunch
and I'll make a call. It's just like old times.

1281
01:38:19.050 --> 01:38:21.550
So this is what you all
spent your Saturdays doing...

1282
01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:24.510
...while I was with Brady and Steve
at the Brooklyn Aquarium?

1283
01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:27.020
Well...

1284
01:38:27.310 --> 01:38:29.520
...not every Saturday.

1285
01:38:29.690 --> 01:38:33.860
Just so you know, we always had
front row at the mammal show.

1286
01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:37.110
Steve does the funniest
dolphin impression.

1287
01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:41.160
Actually, it's more Steve as a dolphin.

1288
01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:48.330
You really can't forgive him?

1289
01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:51.210
Are you suggesting something?

1290
01:38:52.210 --> 01:38:55.050
I like Steve. I always liked Steve.

1291
01:38:55.210 --> 01:38:58.880
He's apologized 100 times.
He's not seeing anyone else.

1292
01:38:59.050 --> 01:39:00.050
What's it gonna take?

1293
01:39:00.430 --> 01:39:02.550
Are you also suggesting
that she forgive Big?

1294
01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:06.890
No. I could kill Big.

1295
01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:09.730
Sometimes when I'm running...

1296
01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:14.310
...I imagine what I would say to him
if I ever saw him again.

1297
01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:17.530
I have the perfect opening line.

1298
01:39:17.690 --> 01:39:19.650
Do you wanna hear it?

1299
01:39:20.490 --> 01:39:22.610
Uh, yeah.

1300
01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:26.910
I curse the day you were born.

1301
01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:31.750
That's impressive. You better work up
a hand gesture to go with it.

1302
01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:44.680
I didn't know if it was the fashion...

1303
01:39:44.850 --> 01:39:47.640
...or the fact that the four of us
were together again...

1304
01:39:47.810 --> 01:39:50.560
...but for the first time in a long time...

1305
01:39:50.730 --> 01:39:53.100
...I felt like myself.

1306
01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:28.600
Well, let's get a cab, okay?
I'm absolutely starving. I don't know what...

1307
01:40:28.770 --> 01:40:30.350
Fur is murder!

1308
01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:33.980
Murder! Murder!

1309
01:40:34.150 --> 01:40:38.190
- Murder! Murder!
- God, I miss New York.

1310
01:40:41.110 --> 01:40:45.990
And a couple of weeks later, I met
Saint Louise's St. Louis boyfriend, Will.

1311
01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:48.950
Over Christmas, they realized
how much they loved each other.

1312
01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:50.790
- I'm Carrie.
- Will.

1313
01:40:51.330 --> 01:40:53.620
Just in time for Valentine's Day.

1314
01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:20.520
Hello?

1315
01:41:20.690 --> 01:41:24.030
I'm calling to make sure that you
aren't hanging from your shower rod.

1316
01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:28.620
- You called about an hour too early.
- So, what's the V-Day plan?

1317
01:41:28.780 --> 01:41:32.330
Well, Miranda and I are going to dinner...

1318
01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:34.870
...and then a very violent slasher movie.

1319
01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:36.670
- Perfect.
- You?

1320
01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:40.250
I'm making Smith sushi.
Pause for reaction.

1321
01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:42.300
Wow, you do that?

1322
01:41:42.460 --> 01:41:44.840
We took a class a while back.

1323
01:41:45.010 --> 01:41:47.130
And when he comes in that door
at 7:30...

1324
01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:51.300
...l'm going to surprise him by
laying naked on the dining-room table...

1325
01:41:51.470 --> 01:41:53.810
...covered with homemade sushi.

1326
01:41:54.230 --> 01:41:56.770
Boy, you do have time on your hands.

1327
01:41:57.190 --> 01:41:59.020
So, what else is new?

1328
01:42:22.670 --> 01:42:25.800
There is a whole lot of love in this room.

1329
01:42:25.970 --> 01:42:29.090
Is it me or is Valentine's Day
this year on steroids?

1330
01:42:29.260 --> 01:42:32.800
No. I think it was like this last year.
We just played for the other team.

1331
01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:36.680
Good evening.
This is our Valentine's night menu.

1332
01:42:36.850 --> 01:42:40.600
All of our specials are romantically themed
and designed to be split for two.

1333
01:42:40.770 --> 01:42:42.110
- Are we having wine?
- Yes.

1334
01:42:42.270 --> 01:42:43.520
- Glass or a...?
- Bottle.

1335
01:42:43.690 --> 01:42:46.610
I'll be right back to take
you and your girlfriend's order.

1336
01:42:53.030 --> 01:42:56.870
Why would you have looked
at the Vogue today of all days?

1337
01:42:57.040 --> 01:42:59.040
Because I'm an emotional cutter.

1338
01:43:00.210 --> 01:43:03.290
I deserve what I got.
Running all over New York...

1339
01:43:03.460 --> 01:43:05.920
...believing that I'm finally getting
my happy ending.

1340
01:43:06.090 --> 01:43:07.760
"See? Love does conquer all.

1341
01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:10.090
Look at me in
my one-of-a-kind wedding gown...

1342
01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:13.260
...marrying the love of my life."
- Would you like another bot...?

1343
01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:14.850
- Yes.
- Yes.

1344
01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:19.560
And Miranda, in that article,
I did not say "we" once.

1345
01:43:19.980 --> 01:43:24.520
No. The whole article
was "I think" and "I want."

1346
01:43:24.690 --> 01:43:27.730
- It was from your point of view.
- Yeah, exactly. My point of view.

1347
01:43:27.900 --> 01:43:31.240
Exactly. The whole wedding
was my point of view.

1348
01:43:32.410 --> 01:43:35.160
I let... I let the wedding
get bigger than Big.

1349
01:43:37.750 --> 01:43:41.210
I am the reason that
he did not get out of the car.

1350
01:43:42.830 --> 01:43:44.380
Okay.

1351
01:43:45.130 --> 01:43:49.670
I said something to Big
that I shouldn't have...

1352
01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:51.670
...at the rehearsal dinner.

1353
01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:53.680
What do you mean?

1354
01:43:54.970 --> 01:43:58.060
After Steve showed up,
I was really upset.

1355
01:43:58.220 --> 01:44:00.430
And I bumped into Big...

1356
01:44:03.150 --> 01:44:05.610
...and I said that you two
were crazy to get married.

1357
01:44:05.770 --> 01:44:08.110
Here we go, your Shiraz.

1358
01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:20.200
Okay, great. Thanks so much.

1359
01:44:24.630 --> 01:44:28.460
I'm sorry. I was upset. Steve had...

1360
01:44:28.630 --> 01:44:33.090
I have been going over this and over this
in my mind for five months.

1361
01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:38.470
And for five months,
you kept a secret like that?

1362
01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:41.140
- I tried to tell you once, but then...
- Once?

1363
01:44:41.310 --> 01:44:43.940
You tried to tell me once?

1364
01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:47.310
You should have tried to tell me
every single day.

1365
01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:49.900
I know. I was waiting for the right time.

1366
01:44:50.070 --> 01:44:52.990
There is no right time to tell me
that you ruined my marriage.

1367
01:44:53.150 --> 01:44:55.660
It just happened. I wasn't thinking.

1368
01:44:57.740 --> 01:45:01.490
- Carrie, please don't go.
- You know what I think hurts the most?

1369
01:45:02.370 --> 01:45:04.790
Is that you kept a secret from me.

1370
01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:09.250
And I have never, ever
kept a secret from you.

1371
01:45:09.420 --> 01:45:11.090
Ever.

1372
01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:15.510
No, I'm lying. For the last five months...

1373
01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:20.010
...l've been thinking that it is
a huge mistake that you left Steve.

1374
01:45:20.180 --> 01:45:21.680
There.

1375
01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:24.350
How does it feel?

1376
01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:27.440
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1377
01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:49.630
Any minute now.

1378
01:45:59.470 --> 01:46:01.390
Hey, babe, it's me. Pick up.

1379
01:46:02.180 --> 01:46:03.720
Pick up.

1380
01:46:04.140 --> 01:46:06.270
All right, it's 7:20. I'm still at the studio.

1381
01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:10.400
We're behind. I'm gonna be a little bit late.
Sorry. Bye.

1382
01:46:20.070 --> 01:46:21.780
Forty minutes later...

1383
01:46:21.950 --> 01:46:26.330
...sushi, Samantha, still no Smith.

1384
01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:34.840
This is bullshit.

1385
01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:10.460
It was the same Valentine night
Samantha had planned...

1386
01:47:10.620 --> 01:47:12.790
...minus the sushi.

1387
01:47:14.380 --> 01:47:16.590
And the other woman.

1388
01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:28.470
I'm home.

1389
01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:31.770
- Man, that was a long day.
- You're three hours late.

1390
01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:34.270
Bummer, I know. Did you eat?

1391
01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:35.940
Yes, I ate.

1392
01:47:36.110 --> 01:47:38.230
I ate the sushi
that I hand-made for you.

1393
01:47:38.690 --> 01:47:43.660
The sushi that I laid all over my naked body
as a Valentine surprise for you.

1394
01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:46.660
Why are you so upset? I called.

1395
01:47:46.830 --> 01:47:48.660
I couldn't pick up the phone.

1396
01:47:48.830 --> 01:47:51.830
My body was covered everywhere
with sushi.

1397
01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.500
I got wasabi in places where
one should never get wasabi.

1398
01:47:55.670 --> 01:48:00.760
Oh, you think it's funny
that I slaved all day in this kitchen...

1399
01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:03.760
...to make a lovely meal for you?

1400
01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:08.140
You made some sushi. It's not a big deal.

1401
01:48:08.310 --> 01:48:10.480
"Not a big deal." Here.

1402
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:12.690
I am not the type of woman...

1403
01:48:12.850 --> 01:48:15.150
...who sits home all day
waiting for a man!

1404
01:48:16.270 --> 01:48:20.860
Enjoy your California handmade roll!

1405
01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:26.450
Happy fucking Valentine's Day.

1406
01:48:34.580 --> 01:48:36.420
It's Carrie, leave me a message.

1407
01:48:36.590 --> 01:48:39.300
Carrie, it's me. Please pick up.

1408
01:48:39.460 --> 01:48:44.090
Three days of
"I'm sorry" calls and e-mails and flowers...

1409
01:48:44.260 --> 01:48:46.220
...and I still wasn't ready.

1410
01:48:46.390 --> 01:48:49.890
It was the longest we'd ever gone
without speaking.

1411
01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:57.810
Carrie.

1412
01:48:58.400 --> 01:48:59.480
Hi.

1413
01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:04.070
- I need to talk to you.
- How long have you been waiting here?

1414
01:49:05.740 --> 01:49:07.490
Seventeen-dollars long.

1415
01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:12.250
Please get in. It just hit 18.

1416
01:49:25.930 --> 01:49:30.560
- This is weird, not talking.
- I'm upset.

1417
01:49:31.810 --> 01:49:36.440
Carrie, I understand, but it just happened.
I never meant to hurt you.

1418
01:49:40.940 --> 01:49:42.940
You have to forgive me.

1419
01:49:44.650 --> 01:49:45.860
You know...

1420
01:49:46.030 --> 01:49:47.070
- What?
- No.

1421
01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:49.320
No, please, what were you gonna say?

1422
01:49:49.490 --> 01:49:52.450
You badger me to forgive you
in three days.

1423
01:49:52.620 --> 01:49:56.580
You won't even consider forgiving Steve
for something he did six months ago.

1424
01:49:56.960 --> 01:49:58.540
It's not the same thing.

1425
01:49:59.590 --> 01:50:01.130
It's forgiveness.

1426
01:50:06.050 --> 01:50:08.890
I don't know that I can trust
that it won't happen again.

1427
01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:12.220
Steve, you're very quiet today.

1428
01:50:14.060 --> 01:50:18.350
Miranda, I know I made it hard
for you to trust me...

1429
01:50:21.650 --> 01:50:24.440
...but you made it hard for me to trust you.
- Me?

1430
01:50:24.610 --> 01:50:27.990
The way you treated me
and cut me out of your life like that.

1431
01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:30.820
I mean, yea, I broke a vow...

1432
01:50:30.990 --> 01:50:33.990
...but what about the other vows?

1433
01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:38.120
Like promising to love someone
for better or for worse.

1434
01:50:38.290 --> 01:50:40.000
What about that?

1435
01:50:40.670 --> 01:50:43.840
How do I know she's not gonna
punish me for the rest of my life?

1436
01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:45.250
You don't.

1437
01:50:46.090 --> 01:50:50.640
And she doesn't know for sure that
you won't have another indiscretion.

1438
01:50:53.180 --> 01:50:56.270
All you can know is that
you wanna move forward...

1439
01:50:56.430 --> 01:51:00.850
...and risk that the love you have
for each other won't allow that to happen.

1440
01:51:04.150 --> 01:51:07.070
And that's what we'll discover here.

1441
01:51:12.870 --> 01:51:15.370
So we're done with our last session.

1442
01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:18.120
We're not allowed to talk to each other
for two weeks...

1443
01:51:18.290 --> 01:51:22.040
...while we figure out if being together
again is something that we really want.

1444
01:51:22.210 --> 01:51:25.670
And then we had to
pick a place to meet...

1445
01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:29.800
...and if we both show up on that day,
the past no longer exists.

1446
01:51:29.970 --> 01:51:32.680
It's like showing up
is our promise to each other...

1447
01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:37.390
...that we're both willing to
let it all go and move forward.

1448
01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:38.890
Wow.

1449
01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:41.520
- Can you do that?
- I don't know.

1450
01:51:41.690 --> 01:51:44.860
I don't know.
I have a lot of thinking to do.

1451
01:51:45.020 --> 01:51:48.650
- Thinking? Or feeling?
- What do you mean?

1452
01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:53.160
Well, Miranda, you're a lawyer. You know,
you can argue both sides of any case.

1453
01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:58.740
But why we feel what we feel
isn't logical. It's emotional.

1454
01:51:59.410 --> 01:52:01.250
I'm sorry, Harvard, but I'm afraid...

1455
01:52:01.410 --> 01:52:04.920
...you're gonna have to base
this decision on your emotions.

1456
01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:08.250
Well, then I'm screwed.
I don't know what I feel.

1457
01:52:08.420 --> 01:52:10.840
You will. There will come a moment
when you know.

1458
01:52:11.010 --> 01:52:13.630
And if it's "yes"'
then all that brilliant logic...

1459
01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:16.430
...it's gonna go right out the window
with the past.

1460
01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:17.600
Ugh.

1461
01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:20.430
And I thought picking a spot to meet
was gonna be the challenge.

1462
01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:23.770
- Where is it?
- On the Brooklyn Bridge.

1463
01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:28.610
- Halfway between our two places.
- Very logical, and yet poetic.

1464
01:52:29.110 --> 01:52:31.320
Poetic if we both show up.

1465
01:52:31.490 --> 01:52:34.280
Otherwise you're on a bridge, rojected.

1466
01:52:35.530 --> 01:52:37.530
It's not a good plan.

1467
01:52:42.910 --> 01:52:45.040
- Hey.
Hey.

1468
01:52:45.540 --> 01:52:46.960
I got two pieces of good news.

1469
01:52:47.130 --> 01:52:49.800
- Oh, and I've got two coffees.
- Thank you.

1470
01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:51.670
Here you go. So, what's up?

1471
01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:55.800
I just heard from your realtor
and the apartment on 5th has finally sold.

1472
01:52:55.970 --> 01:53:00.390
You got 60 days before the new owner
takes possession, and you're out of there.

1473
01:53:01.930 --> 01:53:03.810
And what is the other news?

1474
01:53:08.820 --> 01:53:12.650
I'm moving back to St. Louis
and we're getting married in the fall.

1475
01:53:12.820 --> 01:53:14.280
Oh, my God.

1476
01:53:14.950 --> 01:53:17.820
Wait a minute, I gotta see that.

1477
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:22.580
- Well, it's gorgeous.
- And you know what? It ain't rented.

1478
01:53:26.920 --> 01:53:29.000
On the day of her decision deadline...

1479
01:53:29.170 --> 01:53:32.840
...true to form, Miranda had argued
both sides of the case.

1480
01:53:33.010 --> 01:53:34.510
Thank you.

1481
01:53:56.530 --> 01:53:58.530
It suddenly dawned on Miranda...

1482
01:53:58.700 --> 01:54:02.790
...that Steve's list might have
had more cons than pros.

1483
01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:51.080
And Miranda never looked back.

1484
01:54:56.760 --> 01:55:00.220
Well, almost never.

1485
01:55:00.390 --> 01:55:02.010
Kiss me.

1486
01:55:06.770 --> 01:55:10.440
Meanwhile, back in Lost Ángeles...

1487
01:55:13.270 --> 01:55:16.940
Turns out New Age philosophy
wasn't the secret.

1488
01:55:18.950 --> 01:55:22.570
Samantha had money, a career,
and a man who loved her.

1489
01:55:22.740 --> 01:55:26.700
But still, she couldn't shake the feeling
that something was missing from her life.

1490
01:55:26.870 --> 01:55:28.790
Baby, come back.

1491
01:55:29.290 --> 01:55:31.370
That's not our house.

1492
01:55:31.540 --> 01:55:34.210
Where are you going?

1493
01:56:11.160 --> 01:56:13.750
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

1494
01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:15.330
I'm your next-door neighbor...

1495
01:56:15.500 --> 01:56:18.170
...and my dog ran up on
your dick... Deck.

1496
01:56:21.130 --> 01:56:24.260
Suddenly it wasn't so secret
what she was missing.

1497
01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:25.970
Wanna join me?

1498
01:56:29.850 --> 01:56:31.390
Uh...

1499
01:56:35.900 --> 01:56:38.730
Hey. I'm Dante.

1500
01:56:38.900 --> 01:56:41.690
Stop by anytime.

1501
01:56:43.910 --> 01:56:45.990
It was official.

1502
01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:48.660
From the minute she met Dante...

1503
01:56:48.830 --> 01:56:51.910
...Samantha was in hell.

1504
01:56:53.790 --> 01:56:56.880
And by spring, I looked like my old self...

1505
01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:00.880
...in my new apartment,
just in time for the baby shower.

1506
01:57:01.050 --> 01:57:03.420
- Oh, excuse me, honey. Hi.
- Sure.

1507
01:57:03.590 --> 01:57:04.630
Hi.

1508
01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:07.340
A woman put a glass on your new desk
without a coaster.

1509
01:57:07.510 --> 01:57:10.060
I said, "If you do it again'
I'm gonna break your arm."

1510
01:57:10.220 --> 01:57:11.270
- Thanks.
- Bathroom?

1511
01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:14.060
- Yes. Hey, how's it going?
- Pretty good, I think.

1512
01:57:14.230 --> 01:57:15.690
Good, good, good.

1513
01:57:15.850 --> 01:57:18.310
Where's Samantha?
Her plane landed two hours ago.

1514
01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:20.900
Oh, you know her.
She's probably working out first.

1515
01:57:21.070 --> 01:57:22.900
There's no place like home.

1516
01:57:23.070 --> 01:57:25.240
Sweetie.

1517
01:57:27.370 --> 01:57:28.700
You have a rat in your purse.

1518
01:57:28.870 --> 01:57:31.120
- That rat better be housebroken.
- Take your coat?

1519
01:57:31.290 --> 01:57:34.250
- Sure.
- Hey, cute bag.

1520
01:57:35.500 --> 01:57:37.000
Oh, my gos, Samantha.

1521
01:57:39.250 --> 01:57:41.460
You have a dog.

1522
01:57:41.630 --> 01:57:44.590
Did you ever think you'd see the day?
Me with a pooch?

1523
01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:46.550
Mother of God, what's with the gut?

1524
01:57:48.550 --> 01:57:50.430
Well, she's eating something out there.

1525
01:57:51.310 --> 01:57:53.390
- Come on in!
Hi!

1526
01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:55.270
We've been waiting for you.

1527
01:57:59.150 --> 01:58:02.520
I eat so I won't cheat.

1528
01:58:02.690 --> 01:58:04.360
What exactly are you eating?

1529
01:58:04.780 --> 01:58:07.030
Everything except Dante's dick.

1530
01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:09.870
Language, please.
This is a grown-up apartment now.

1531
01:58:10.780 --> 01:58:13.910
I guess I didn't realize how big I was
until I saw it on your faces.

1532
01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:16.910
How...? And I say this with love.

1533
01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:19.630
How could you not realize it?

1534
01:58:19.790 --> 01:58:23.130
- I've been avoiding mirrors.
- Well, I'm proud of you for not cheating.

1535
01:58:23.300 --> 01:58:25.420
I don't think there's anything
to be proud of.

1536
01:58:25.590 --> 01:58:29.720
I stuff my face to stop myself from
doing something that feels natural to me.

1537
01:58:29.890 --> 01:58:34.140
Now, listen, this isn't about the weight.
You would look gorgeous at any size.

1538
01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:37.810
- But are you happy?
- Well...

1539
01:58:39.400 --> 01:58:44.650
...relationships aren't always
about being happy, right?

1540
01:58:44.820 --> 01:58:47.440
I mean, how often do you feel happy
in your relationship?

1541
01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:50.570
I'm pretty sure that's to you.

1542
01:58:51.700 --> 01:58:55.080
- Every day.
- You feel happy every day?

1543
01:58:55.250 --> 01:58:59.290
Not all day every day, but every day.

1544
01:58:59.460 --> 01:59:01.960
When was the last time you felt happy?

1545
01:59:02.130 --> 01:59:04.210
Six months ago.

1546
01:59:04.500 --> 01:59:07.420
I think that's normal for L.A.

1547
01:59:07.590 --> 01:59:10.340
- What am I gonna do?
- What's your gut tell you?

1548
01:59:13.680 --> 01:59:18.480
I know, but Smith stayed with me
through chemo.

1549
01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:22.480
And if he can stay with me
through that...

1550
01:59:22.650 --> 01:59:25.900
...then I should be able to
stay in this relationship for him.

1551
01:59:26.070 --> 01:59:29.820
Sweetie, you just compared
your relationship to chemo.

1552
01:59:29.990 --> 01:59:34.530
Î¤here we were,
the three mirrors Samantha couldn't avoid.

1553
01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:36.700
And Samantha?

1554
01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:39.790
That pillow cost $300.

1555
01:59:49.470 --> 01:59:51.430
Hi.

1556
01:59:51.590 --> 01:59:53.550
My little monster. Hi.

1557
01:59:55.220 --> 01:59:58.100
Hey. You're home.

1558
01:59:58.270 --> 02:00:01.850
- I thought you were staying the week.
- We need to talk.

1559
02:00:03.150 --> 02:00:05.400
Oh, man.

1560
02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:10.320
- I knew this was coming.
- Yeah.

1561
02:00:10.490 --> 02:00:12.360
This isn't working.

1562
02:00:12.530 --> 02:00:16.490
I've done my best.
I've given it five years and 15 pounds.

1563
02:00:16.660 --> 02:00:18.580
Well, what?

1564
02:00:20.750 --> 02:00:24.580
- You don't love me anymore?
- Yes, I love you.

1565
02:00:25.130 --> 02:00:26.380
It's just...

1566
02:00:28.710 --> 02:00:32.170
I'm just gonna say the thing
you're not supposed to say.

1567
02:00:32.720 --> 02:00:35.140
I love you but I love me more.

1568
02:00:35.300 --> 02:00:38.810
And I've been in a relationship
with myself for 49 years...

1569
02:00:38.970 --> 02:00:40.930
...and that's the one I need to work on.

1570
02:00:43.650 --> 02:00:48.070
You're gonna find a wonderful woman
who loves being in a relationship.

1571
02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:53.360
What will you find?

1572
02:00:53.990 --> 02:00:55.450
I don't know.

1573
02:00:56.160 --> 02:00:58.780
But that's a risk I'm willing to take.

1574
02:01:03.250 --> 02:01:08.000
- Hey, no. Keep it.
- Okay.

1575
02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:13.470
Every time I look down at it...

1576
02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:19.140
...l'm gonna think of you.

1577
02:01:21.430 --> 02:01:25.480
Some love stories aren't epic novels.
Some are short stories.

1578
02:01:25.650 --> 02:01:29.610
But that doesn't make them
any less filled with love.

1579
02:01:30.110 --> 02:01:31.570
At this time...

1580
02:01:31.730 --> 02:01:33.990
...we ask that all passengers
fasten their seat belts...

1581
02:01:34.150 --> 02:01:36.570
...in preparation for landing.

1582
02:01:37.030 --> 02:01:40.120
We're landing in New York.

1583
02:01:40.490 --> 02:01:42.120
I'm gonna need to take that now.

1584
02:01:44.830 --> 02:01:47.580
Okay. Here we go now. Give me that.

1585
02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:53.670
As someone returned to my life...

1586
02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:54.880
...someone left.

1587
02:01:55.050 --> 02:01:57.220
- Stamps, mailing labels.
- Okay.

1588
02:01:57.390 --> 02:02:01.010
And I put all your unopened mail
from your P.O. Box in these envelopes.

1589
02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:02.720
All right.

1590
02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:08.810
And please, please...

1591
02:02:08.980 --> 02:02:12.020
...do not make a mess
out of CarrieBradshaw. Com.

1592
02:02:12.190 --> 02:02:15.690
- Okay.
- It's my masterpiece.

1593
02:02:16.650 --> 02:02:20.280
- What am I gonna do without you?
- You'll find some other girl...

1594
02:02:20.910 --> 02:02:22.870
...but she won't have my style.

1595
02:02:23.870 --> 02:02:25.910
Saint Louise.

1596
02:02:27.460 --> 02:02:29.210
You brought me back to life.

1597
02:02:29.790 --> 02:02:33.210
And you gave me Louise Vuitton.

1598
02:02:39.590 --> 02:02:43.010
Serious. We need to stop crying.

1599
02:02:44.270 --> 02:02:46.430
- Your keys.
- Oh, thanks.

1600
02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:49.900
Wait, wait, wait. Don't forget your love.

1601
02:02:50.730 --> 02:02:53.980
No. I found my love.

1602
02:02:54.280 --> 02:02:56.740
I'm leaving that with you.

1603
02:02:57.400 --> 02:03:01.410
- See you at my wedding.
- I'll meet you in St. Louis.

1604
02:03:05.370 --> 02:03:06.870
Bye.

1605
02:03:13.590 --> 02:03:15.250
And a couple of weeks later...

1606
02:03:15.420 --> 02:03:18.590
...a slow-moving Charlotte
grabbed a quick lunch.

1607
02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:20.590
- Well, when are you due?
- Next week.

1608
02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:23.930
- You look gorgeous.
- Oh, thank you.

1609
02:03:35.900 --> 02:03:39.530
- Hi. Can I get you something to drink?
- No, no.

1610
02:03:39.700 --> 02:03:42.110
- No?
- No. I can't stay.

1611
02:03:42.570 --> 02:03:45.240
Help me. Help me move the table.

1612
02:03:48.750 --> 02:03:50.330
Charlotte.

1613
02:03:51.290 --> 02:03:53.460
Charlotte, wait. Wait.

1614
02:03:53.630 --> 02:03:56.880
Charlotte. Charlotte, don't run,
you're pregnant.

1615
02:03:57.050 --> 02:04:00.760
I don't wanna see you.
I'm so mad at you.

1616
02:04:00.930 --> 02:04:05.640
I was always on your side.
And then you go and you do that to Carrie.

1617
02:04:05.810 --> 02:04:11.140
No! No! I'm not gonna cry.
I'm not gonna waste tears on you.

1618
02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:15.310
I curse the day you were born.

1619
02:04:19.110 --> 02:04:21.650
I think my water just broke. Oh, my God.

1620
02:04:21.820 --> 02:04:23.950
- Taxi!
- My car's right there.

1621
02:04:24.120 --> 02:04:26.740
I don't wanna get in your car! Taxi!

1622
02:04:26.910 --> 02:04:29.490
Please, I gotta get you
to the hospital, okay? Please?

1623
02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:31.500
- Okay?
Lenox Hill.

1624
02:04:31.660 --> 02:04:33.290
Okay. Start the car.

1625
02:04:42.180 --> 02:04:43.180
Hey.

1626
02:04:43.340 --> 02:04:47.510
Hi. Congratulations. A girl.

1627
02:04:47.970 --> 02:04:50.770
It's my lot in life to be surrounded
by beautiful women.

1628
02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:52.980
Come here.

1629
02:04:58.270 --> 02:05:01.780
- She's gorgeous.
- Say hello to Rose.

1630
02:05:01.940 --> 02:05:06.450
- Rose. What a beautiful name.
- It's after Harry's bubbe.

1631
02:05:06.620 --> 02:05:09.830
Now we got a Lily and a Rose.

1632
02:05:10.500 --> 02:05:11.910
Well...

1633
02:05:12.080 --> 02:05:15.870
...I have to say,
you two are very cool customers...

1634
02:05:16.040 --> 02:05:21.300
...making the "baby's here" call
without all the "I'm in labor" drama.

1635
02:05:21.460 --> 02:05:24.050
There was plenty of drama.

1636
02:05:25.010 --> 02:05:27.800
My water broke while I was standing
in front of a restaurant.

1637
02:05:28.220 --> 02:05:32.390
- Wow, that's very dramatic.
- Wait, wait, she's not done.

1638
02:05:32.560 --> 02:05:35.560
- It broke while I was talking to Big.
- What?

1639
02:05:35.730 --> 02:05:37.770
See? Drama.

1640
02:05:37.940 --> 02:05:40.570
I ran into him and
I got so upset, my water broke.

1641
02:05:41.570 --> 02:05:45.320
He brought her to the hospital,
stayed until the baby was born.

1642
02:05:46.490 --> 02:05:49.070
I think he was hoping to see you.

1643
02:05:52.160 --> 02:05:56.370
Well, today is not about him.
It's about beautiful baby Rose.

1644
02:05:57.500 --> 02:06:01.090
So we know she has Charlotte's hair.
What else do we know?

1645
02:06:03.800 --> 02:06:07.760
- She's a doll. Mazel tov.
- Thank you.

1646
02:06:08.760 --> 02:06:10.260
Bye.

1647
02:06:10.600 --> 02:06:13.770
He asked me to ask you to call him.

1648
02:06:14.600 --> 02:06:17.690
I know, it's none of my business,
but I felt bad for the schmuck...

1649
02:06:17.850 --> 02:06:20.150
...hanging around the hospital
hoping to see you.

1650
02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:25.030
Every time he heard someone in heels
walking down the hall, his heart stopped.

1651
02:06:26.900 --> 02:06:31.320
Harry, it's... It's so much more complicated
than you can imagine.

1652
02:06:31.490 --> 02:06:35.450
I know it is, and you have every right
to never call him, but I just...

1653
02:06:35.620 --> 02:06:39.500
I'm a big pile of love today
and I feel bad for the guy.

1654
02:06:39.670 --> 02:06:42.590
He said he's been writing you,
but you never responded.

1655
02:06:44.210 --> 02:06:45.630
No, he's never written to me.

1656
02:06:45.800 --> 02:06:48.930
He said he wrote because
he didn't have your phone number.

1657
02:06:49.970 --> 02:06:52.890
No, he's never written. Ever.

1658
02:06:53.060 --> 02:06:56.100
Then why would he say he had?

1659
02:07:36.470 --> 02:07:41.440
Two hours, two manila envelopes
and countless e-mails later...

1660
02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:45.730
...I was just about to give up
on the big riddle when...

1661
02:07:45.900 --> 02:07:50.450
I had told Louise to put Big in a place where
I would never have to hear from him again.

1662
02:08:02.580 --> 02:08:04.040
This is Louise, leave a message.

1663
02:08:04.210 --> 02:08:06.210
Hey... Hey, Louise, it's me.

1664
02:08:06.380 --> 02:08:10.720
Can you give me the password
for your assistant file?

1665
02:08:10.880 --> 02:08:12.340
Um...

1666
02:08:12.510 --> 02:08:14.890
Okay, call me. Thanks.

1667
02:08:17.220 --> 02:08:19.430
Oh, shit.

1668
02:08:35.740 --> 02:08:39.330
As soon as I typed in "love,"
there he was.

1669
02:08:44.580 --> 02:08:46.920
And because Big
still didn't have the words...

1670
02:08:47.090 --> 02:08:49.750
...he retyped a love letter
from Beethoven.

1671
02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:53.090
And Lord Byron.

1672
02:08:54.720 --> 02:08:57.050
And John Keats.

1673
02:08:57.390 --> 02:08:58.680
And Voltaire.

1674
02:08:59.390 --> 02:09:03.480
There they were, the love letters
of great men, volume one.

1675
02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:08.110
Plus one more
written by John James Preston.

1676
02:09:24.290 --> 02:09:26.790
I wanted to call him, but our love...

1677
02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:30.210
...Carrie and Big,
volumes one, two and three...

1678
02:09:30.670 --> 02:09:32.590
...stopped me.

1679
02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:38.720
Hello?

1680
02:09:38.890 --> 02:09:41.850
I didn't hear my phone.
We're shopping for my wedding gown.

1681
02:09:42.020 --> 02:09:44.180
That dress makes your boobies look big.

1682
02:09:44.350 --> 02:09:47.230
- Mama, can you please? This is a work call.
- Shut up.

1683
02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:52.190
- No, it's okay, I figured it out.
- Well, I was gonna call you anyway.

1684
02:09:52.360 --> 02:09:54.690
Today is the final day
on the 5th Avenue apartment.

1685
02:09:54.860 --> 02:09:57.070
You have till 6:00
before they change the locks.

1686
02:09:57.240 --> 02:09:58.990
No, I don't need to go over there.

1687
02:09:59.580 --> 02:10:01.490
Do you not want those never-worn shoes?

1688
02:10:01.660 --> 02:10:04.040
Oh, God, I completely forgot.

1689
02:10:04.210 --> 02:10:07.830
If you don't, you can send them to me
and I'll squeeze my feet into them.

1690
02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:09.880
But it's already 5:00.

1691
02:10:10.040 --> 02:10:13.550
Hello? They are never-been-worn'
$400 shoes.

1692
02:10:13.710 --> 02:10:18.590
Actually 525.
Yeah, okay. All right, thanks. Bye.

1693
02:10:19.430 --> 02:10:21.470
Taxi!

1694
02:10:30.940 --> 02:10:34.440
The light in our prewar apartment...

1695
02:10:34.610 --> 02:10:37.900
...looked completely different postwar.

1696
02:10:58.510 --> 02:11:03.220
I was gonna get these to you.
I didn't want it to be a total loss.

1697
02:11:03.510 --> 02:11:07.390
It wasn't logic, it was love.

1698
02:11:28.500 --> 02:11:31.500
Why did we ever decide to get married?

1699
02:11:33.670 --> 02:11:39.170
I guess we were afraid
it would mean something if we didn't.

1700
02:11:43.390 --> 02:11:49.850
I'm sorry to have done that to you.

1701
02:11:53.860 --> 02:11:55.940
You know the funny part?

1702
02:11:57.990 --> 02:12:00.200
Is there a funny part?

1703
02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:04.660
We were perfectly happy before
we decided to live happily ever after.

1704
02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:06.990
Guess the joke's on us.

1705
02:12:16.050 --> 02:12:19.880
- It's a good closet.
- Thanks.

1706
02:12:23.180 --> 02:12:25.550
It's comfortable.

1707
02:12:25.890 --> 02:12:29.220
Is this what you had in mind
when you installed the carpet?

1708
02:12:30.270 --> 02:12:33.270
I'd like to think I was that smooth.

1709
02:12:40.700 --> 02:12:44.530
We better get up
before the new owners bust in on us.

1710
02:12:53.580 --> 02:12:57.340
And the way we decided to get married...

1711
02:12:57.500 --> 02:12:59.420
...it was all business.

1712
02:12:59.590 --> 02:13:01.760
No romance.

1713
02:13:04.260 --> 02:13:09.350
That's not the way
you propose to someone.

1714
02:13:10.770 --> 02:13:12.770
This is.

1715
02:13:16.270 --> 02:13:18.360
Carrie Bradshaw...

1716
02:13:19.070 --> 02:13:20.440
...love of my life...

1717
02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:25.360
...will you marry me?

1718
02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:32.580
See, this is why there's a diamond.

1719
02:13:32.750 --> 02:13:34.870
You need to do something
to close the deal.

1720
02:13:59.440 --> 02:14:00.650
And forsaking all others...

1721
02:14:00.820 --> 02:14:04.690
And in the end, Carrie Bradshaw
married John James Preston...

1722
02:14:04.860 --> 02:14:06.530
...in a label-less dress.
- I do.

1723
02:14:06.990 --> 02:14:09.660
Then by the power vested in me
by the state of New York...

1724
02:14:09.830 --> 02:14:14.410
...I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

1725
02:14:25.010 --> 02:14:27.010
Ever thine. Ever mine.

1726
02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:30.470
Ever ours.

1727
02:14:32.890 --> 02:14:35.230
So you're okay that it was just us?

1728
02:14:35.390 --> 02:14:39.980
It was perfect. You and me, like I said.

1729
02:14:40.150 --> 02:14:43.400
Still, it would have been nice
if you had the girls here.

1730
02:14:45.070 --> 02:14:47.490
Which is why I called them.

1731
02:14:51.780 --> 02:14:54.490
- Hi, Carrie!
- Mazel tov!

1732
02:14:57.710 --> 02:15:00.790
- Ham and eggs. Ham and eggs for you, sir.
- Yup, that's me.

1733
02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:03.630
It wasn't a fancy, designer reception either.

1734
02:15:04.170 --> 02:15:06.300
Just food and friends.

1735
02:15:08.510 --> 02:15:10.390
Butter, ma'am?

1736
02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:14.350
How's the marriage going?

1737
02:15:34.540 --> 02:15:39.710
"And as I put the wedding gown away'
I couldn't help but wonder:

1738
02:15:39.870 --> 02:15:44.090
'Why is it that we're willing
to write our own vows...

1739
02:15:44.250 --> 02:15:47.760
...but not our own rules?"'

1740
02:15:47.970 --> 02:15:50.470
And that's just a little something
I'm working on.

1741
02:15:52.930 --> 02:15:54.680
Thank you.

1742
02:15:56.350 --> 02:15:58.020
Oh, my God.

1743
02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:03.100
Maybe some labels
are best left in the closet.

1744
02:16:03.270 --> 02:16:04.770
Maybe when we label people:

1745
02:16:04.940 --> 02:16:09.190
"Bride," "groom," "husband,"
"wife," "married," "single"...

1746
02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:12.860
...we forget to look past the label
to the person.

1747
02:16:14.070 --> 02:16:17.120
- This is delicious.
- Why did we ever stop drinking these?

1748
02:16:17.290 --> 02:16:20.910
- Because everyone else started.
- Well, that one's an oldie but goodie.

1749
02:16:21.080 --> 02:16:23.880
And speaking of an oldie but goodie...

1750
02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:28.920
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

1751
02:16:29.880 --> 02:16:31.930
Wait, wait, wait. A toast.

1752
02:16:32.090 --> 02:16:33.640
To Samantha.

1753
02:16:33.800 --> 02:16:36.550
Fifty and fabulous.

1754
02:16:42.650 --> 02:16:44.480
To us...

1755
02:16:46.230 --> 02:16:47.320
...and the next 50.

1756
02:16:47.480 --> 02:16:49.820
To the next 50.

1757
02:16:51.900 --> 02:16:56.280
And there, in the same city
where they met as girls...

1758
02:16:56.450 --> 02:17:00.790
...four New York women
entered the next phase of their lives...

1759
02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:04.580
...dressed head to toe in love.

1760
02:17:05.210 --> 02:17:07.420
And that's the one label...

1761
02:17:07.590 --> 02:17:10.800
...that never goes out of style.
