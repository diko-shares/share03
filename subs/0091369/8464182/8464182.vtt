Give me the child.

Through dangers untold
and hardships unnumbered,

24
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.510
I have fought my way here
to the castle beyond the goblin city

25
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.230
to take back the child
that you have stolen.

26
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.600
For my will is as strong as yours,

27
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.820
and my kingdom is as great.

28
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.950
For my will is as strong as yours,
my kingdom as great.

29
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.370
Damn.

30
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.700
Oh, I can never remember that line.

31
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.700
"You have no power over me."

32
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.130
Oh, Merlin.

33
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.390
Oh, no, Merlin.
I don't believe it it's 7:00!

34
00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.140
Come on. Come on!

35
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.570
" no one can blame you "

36
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.790

" hurts like hell, hurts like hell

44
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.150
oh, it's not fair!

45
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.650
Oh, really.

46
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.680
- I'm sorry.
- Well, don't stand there in the rain.

47
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.410
- Come on.
- I all right. Come on, Merlin.

48
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.370
- Come on.
- Not the dog.

49
00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.750
- But it's pouring.
- Go on, into the garage.

50
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.920
Oh. Go on, Merlin. Go into the garage.

51
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.130
- Sarah, you're an hour late.
- I said I'm sorry!

52
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.260
Please let me finish.

53
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.270
- Your father and I go out very rarely.
- You go out every single weekend.

54
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.470
I ask you to babysit only
if it won't interfere with your plans.

55
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.770
Well, how do you know?
You don't know what my plans are.

56
00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.230
You don't even ask me anymore.

57
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.590
I assume you'd tell me if you had a date.

58
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.820
I'd like it if you had a date.

59
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.200
- You should have dates at your age.
- Ah, Sarah, you're home.

60
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.040
We were worried about you.
I can't do anything right, can I?

61
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.200
She treats me like a wicked stepmother
in a fairy story no matter what I say.

62
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.330
I'll talk to her.

63
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.270
Through dangers untold

64
00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.530
and hardships unnumbered,

65
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.240
I have fought my way here to the castle

66
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.240
beyond the goblin city

67
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.240
to take back the child

68
00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.990
that you have stolen.

69
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.120
Sarah, can I talk to you?

70
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.210
There's nothing to talk about!

71
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.400
You'd better hurry. You're gonna be late.

72
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.930
Listen, we fed Toby
and put him to bed.

73
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.930
We do have to leave now,
but we'll be back around midnight.

74
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.880
You really wanted to talk to me,
didn't you?

75
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.640
Practically broke down the door.

76
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.360
Lancelot!
Someone has been in my room again.

77
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.560
I hate that. I hate it!

78
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.580
I hate you. I hate you!

79
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.620
Someone save me.

80
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.200
Someone take me away
from this awful place!

81
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.800
What do you want?
You want a story? Huh?

82
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:13.580
Okay.

83
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.590
Once upon a time,
there was a beautiful young girl

84
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.050
whose stepmother always made her
stay home with the baby.

85
00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:26.440
And the baby was a spoiled child
and he wanted everything for himself,

86
00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.360
and the young girl
was practically a slave.

87
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:31.980
But what no one knew

88
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.730
was that the king of the goblins
had fallen in love with the girl,

89
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.280
and he had given her certain powers.

90
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:39.830
So one night,

91
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:42.450
when the baby had been
particularly cruel to her,

92
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.570
she called on the goblins for help.

93
00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:48.620
Listen.

94
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.750
"Say your right words," the goblins said.

95
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.630
"And we'll take the baby
to the goblin city,

96
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.430
and you will be free."

97
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.800
Ah!

98
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:07.400
But the girl knew
that the king of the goblins

99
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.020
would keep the baby in his castle
forever and ever and ever

100
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.270
and turn it into a goblin.

101
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.730
And so the girl suffered in silence,

102
00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:19.780
until one night
when she was tired from a day of housework

103
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.660
and she was hurt by the harsh words
of her stepmother

104
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:25.740
and she could no longer stand it...

105
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.670
On, all right, all right.

106
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.370
Knock it off come on.

107
00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:39.460
Stop it! Stop it! I'll say the words.

108
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:43.420
No, I mustn't. I mustn't say.

109
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.800
I wish.

110
00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:47.980
I wish.

111
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.390
- Listen.
- She's going to say it.

112
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.310
Say what?

113
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.560
- Shut up.
- Sorry.

114
00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.020
You shut up.

115
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.490
Listen. She's going to say the words.

116
00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.690
I can bear it no longer!

117
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.990
Goblin king, goblin king,
wherever you may be,

118
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.410
take this child of mine
far away from me!

119
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.410
That's not it.

120
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:16.090
Where'd she learn that rubbish?
It doesn't even start with "I wish."

121
00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.920
Oh, Toby, stop it!

122
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.840
Oh, I wish I did know what to say
to make the goblins take you away.

123
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.890
"I wish the goblins would come
and take you away right now."

124
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.720
That's not hard, is it? Huh?

125
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:33.770
I wish.

126
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.610
I wish.

127
00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.560
- Did she say it?
- Shut up!

128
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.300
I wish the goblins would come
and take you away.

129
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:03.510
Right now.

130
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.160
Toby?

131
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.080
Toby, are you all right?

132
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:38.620
Why aren't you crying?

133
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.260
You're him, aren't you?
You're the goblin king.

134
00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.760
I want my brother back,
please, if it's all the same.

135
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:15.970
What's said is said.

136
00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.100
But I didn't mean it.

137
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:19.770
Oh, you didn't?

138
00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.690
Please where is he?

139
00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.390
You know very well where he is.

140
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:27.400
Please bring him back. Please.

141
00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:29.660
Sarah

142
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.330
go back to your room,

143
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.160
play with your toys and your costumes.

144
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.460
Forget about the baby.

145
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.080
I can't.

146
00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.790
I've brought you a gift.

147
00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.630
- What is it?
- It's a crystal.

148
00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.180
Nothing more.

149
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.470
But if you turn it this way,

150
00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.760
look into it,

151
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:55.640
it'll show you your dreams.

152
00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:58.890
But this is not a gift
for an ordinary girl

153
00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.820
who takes care of a screaming baby.

154
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.560
Do you want it?

155
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.690
Then forget the baby.

156
00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.030
I can't.

157
00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.680
It isn't that I don't appreciate
what you're trying to do for me,

158
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.210
but I want my brother back.

159
00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.080
He must be so scared. Sarah.

160
00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:29.880
Don't defy me.

161
00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.730
You're no match for me, Sarah.

162
00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.890
But I have to have my brother back.

163
00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.190
He's there, in my castle.

164
00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:56.620
Do you still want to look for him?

165
00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.410
Is that the castle beyond the goblin city?

166
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.950
Turn back, Sarah.
Turn back before it's too late.

167
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:07.870
I can't.

168
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:10.080
Don't you understand that I can't?

169
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.680
What a pity.

170
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.210
It doesn't look that far.

171
00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.260
It's further than you think.
Time is short.

172
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:28.310
You have 13 hours
in which to solve the labyrinth

173
00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.570
before your baby brother

174
00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.740
becomes one of us... forever.

175
00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.830
Such a pity.

176
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:41.700
The labyrinth.

177
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:44.540
It doesn't look that hard.

178
00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.120
Well, come on, feet.

179
00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.200
Fxcuse me?

180
00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.110
Oh, uh, excuse me!

181
00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.870
Oh, it's you.

182
00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:19.240
Excuse me,
but I have to get through this labyrinth.

183
00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:20.330
Can you help me?

184
00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:22.620
Ohh.

185
00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.870
Oh, how sweet.

186
00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.700
Fifty-seven!

187
00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.540
How could you? Yeah

188
00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.750
poor thing.

189
00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.420
You monster. Ow!

190
00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.550
- Huh?
- It bit me!

191
00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.730
What did you expect fairies to do?

192
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:48.930
I thought they did nice things, like...
Like granting wishes.

193
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:52.140
Huh. Shows what you know, don't it? Oh.

194
00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:54.650
Fifty-eight. You're horrible.

195
00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.650
Huh? No, I ain't.

196
00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.780
I'm hoggle. Who are you?

197
00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:01.650
- Sarah.
- That's what I thought.

198
00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.610
Oh.

199
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:05.200
Fifty-nine.

200
00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:07.250
Do you know where the door
to the labyrinth is?

201
00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.000
- Ooh, maybe.
- Well, where is it?

202
00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:11.580
Oh, you little...

203
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.380
Whah! Sixty! Ooh-ha!

204
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:15.800
I said, where is it?
“Where is what?

205
00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:18.090
The door. “What door?

206
00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.590
It's hopeless asking you anything.

207
00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.800
Not if you ask the right questions.

208
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.260
How do I get into the labyrinth?

209
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.860
Ah

210
00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.100
Now, that's more like it.

211
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.440
You gets in there.

212
00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.410
You, uh, really going in there, are you?

213
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:50.880
Yes

214
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:53.210
I'm afraid I have to.

215
00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.280
Cozy, isn't it?

216
00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:28.370
Now, would you go left or right?

217
00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:35.210
- They both look the same.
- Well, you're not gonna get very far.

218
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.960
Which way would you go? Me?

219
00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:39.540
I wouldn't go either way.

220
00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.460
If that's all the help you're gonna be,
you can just leave.

221
00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:46.590
You know your problem?
You take too many things for granted.

222
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.060
Take this labyrinth.

223
00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:52.480
Even if you get to the center,
you'll never get out again.

224
00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:53.810
That's your opinion.

225
00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.440
Well, it's a lot better than yours.

226
00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.610
Thanks for nothing, hogwart.

227
00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:05.160
Oh, it's hoggle!
And don't say I didn't warn you.

228
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.010
Oh.

229
00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.430
Who's she?

230
00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:10.970
What do they mean, "labyrinth"?

231
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.890
There aren't any turns
or corners or anything.

232
00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:14.600
This just goes on and on.

233
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:23.610
Maybe it doesn't.

234
00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:28.450
Maybe I'm just taking it for granted
that it does.

235
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
'Allo.

236
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:28.630
Did you say "hello"?

237
00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.390
No, I said "allo,"
but that's close enough.

238
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.550
- You're a worm, aren't you?
- Yeah, that's right.

239
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:40.140
You don't by any chance know the way
through this labyrinth, do you?

240
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.690
Who, me? No, I'm just a worm.

241
00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:44.480
Oh.

242
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:46.360
Come inside, meet the missus.

243
00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:50.610
No, thank you,
but I have to solve this labyrinth.

244
00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.450
But there aren't any turns
or any openings or anything.

245
00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.450
It just goes on and on and...

246
00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.750
Well, you ain't looking right.
It's full of openings.

247
00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.450
It's just you ain't seeing them.

248
00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:01.880
- Well, where are they?
- There's one just across there.

249
00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.450
It's right in front of you.

250
00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:06.550
No, there isn't.

251
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.420
Come inside and have a nice cup of tea.

252
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:11.470
But there isn't an opening.

253
00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.470
Of course there is.

254
00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:17.470
You try walking through it.
You'll see what I mean.

255
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.850
- What?
- Go on. Go on, then.

256
00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:24.980
That's just wall. There's no way through.

257
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:27.360
Things are not always
what they seem in this place.

258
00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:30.690
So you can't take anything for granted.

259
00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.070
Hey!

260
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:42.290
Hey. Hang on!

261
00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.240
Thank you. That was incredibly helpful.

262
00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.080
But don't go that way.

263
00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:48.960
What was that? I said, don't go that way.

264
00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.590
Never go that way.

265
00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.800
Oh. Thanks.

266
00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:57.890
If she'd have kept on going
down that way,

267
00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:00.220
she'd have gone straight to that castle.

268
00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.520
Toby.

269
00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.200
I'm coming, Toby.

270
00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.920
Give it back. Just find your own.
Go on, get off me.

271
00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:34.240
Stay out of the way.
What are you talking about?

272
00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:36.300
Walk, walk, walk.

273
00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.150
Hey, what's the matter?

274
00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.830
You remind me of the babe.
“What babe?

275
00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.620
- The babe with the power.
- What power?

276
00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:05.290
The power of voodoo. “Who do?

277
00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:06.410
- You do.
- Do what?

278
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:07.790
Remind me of the babe.

279
00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.960
Quiet! A goblin babe.

280
00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:17.140
Well?

281
00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:27.980
" I saw my baby
crying hard as babe could cry "

282
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:30.100
I what could I do?

283
00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:37.230
" my baby's love had gone
and left my baby blue "

284
00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:39.740
" nobody knew "

285
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:44.990
" what kind of magic spell to use "

286
00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:49.550
- slime and snails? 
- ' or puppy dogs' tails?

287
00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:51.290
" thunder or lightning? "

288
00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:52.750
" then baby said "

289
00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:58.840
- " dance magic, dance " 
- " dance magic, dance "

290
00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:00.590
" put that baby's spell on me "

291
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:07.680
- " jump magic, jump "
- " jump magic, jump "

292
00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:09.890
" put that magic jump on me "

293
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:12.270
"  slap that baby "
> make him free "

294
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.340
Hey, what goes on”?

295
00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.660
Who is writing
on the fraggity walk-walk? Eh?

296
00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.750
Oy-oy-oy-oy.

297
00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.010
Your mother is a fragging aardvark!

298
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:59.700
In nine hours and 23 minutes,

299
00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:01.740
you'll be mine.

300
00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:14.460
" I saw my baby
trying hard as babe could try "

301
00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.040
I what could I do? 

302
00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:23.720
" my baby's fun had gone
and left my baby blue "

303
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:26.180
" nobody knew "

304
00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:31.640
" what kind of magic spell to use "

305
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:36.020
- " slime and snails? "
- " puppy dogs tails? "

306
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:38.020
" thunder or lightning? "

307
00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.320
" then baby said "

308
00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:45.320
- " dance magic, dance "
- " dance magic, dance "

309
00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:47.150
" put that baby's spell on me "

310
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:51.950
- " jump magic, jump "
- " jump magic, jump "

311
00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.400
- " jump magic, jump "
- " jump magic, jump "

312
00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:56.380
" put that magic jump on me "

313
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:58.750
" slap that baby, make him free "

314
00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:06.840
- " dance magic, dance "
- " dance magic, dance "

315
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:12.600
- " jump magic, jump "
- " jump magic, jump "

316
00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:15.050
- " put that baby's spell on me "

317
00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.040
- You got it?
- I got it.

318
00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:37.250
Good. Shh, shh, shh.

319
00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:39.500
Oh, no.

320
00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:51.970
Someone has been
changing my marks.

321
00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:55.230
What a horrible place this is.
It's not fair!

322
00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:57.930
That's right. It's not fair.

323
00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:01.060
But that's only half of it.

324
00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:04.030
This was a dead end a minute ago.

325
00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.830
No, that's the dead end behind you.

326
00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:14.580
It keeps changing.
What am I supposed to do?

327
00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:17.660
Well, the only way out of here
is to try one of these doors.

328
00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.540
One of them leads to the castle
at the center of the labyrinth.

329
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:22.090
And the other one leads to.

330
00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.540
Ba-ba-ba-bum! Certain death.

331
00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:27.600
Ooh.

332
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:29.680
Which one is which?

333
00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:32.730
- Uh, we can't tell you.
- Why not?

334
00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:34.640
- Um...
- I, uh...

335
00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:37.480
- We don't know.
- But they do.

336
00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:39.520
Oh. Then I'll ask them.

337
00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:41.270
Mm... uh

338
00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.850
no, you can't ask us. Hmm.

339
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:44.690
- You can only ask one of us.
- Mm-hm_

340
00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:45.780
It's in the rules.

341
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:47.030
And I should warn you

342
00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:51.610
that one of us always tells the truth,
and one of us always lies.

343
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:54.120
That's a rule too. He always lies.

344
00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:55.820
I do not. I tell the truth.

345
00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.710
- Oh, what a lie.
- Oh!

346
00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.250
He's the liar.

347
00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:03.970
All right. Answer yes or no.

348
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:08.840
Would he tell me
that this door leads to the castle?

349
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.560
Uh

350
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:15.070
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

351
00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:17.060
Yes

352
00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:20.890
then... the other door leads
to the castle,

353
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:22.940
and this door leads to certain death.

354
00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:24.610
Ooh.

355
00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.160
How do you know?
He could be telling the truth.

356
00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.610
But then you wouldn't be.

357
00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:31.490
So if you told me that he said yes,
I know the answer is no.

358
00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:34.410
But I could be telling the truth.
But then he would be lying.

359
00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:37.830
So if you told me that he said yes,
I know the answer would still be no.

360
00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:40.000
Wait a minute. Uh, is that right?

361
00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:42.700
I don't know. I've never understood it.

362
00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:46.630
No, it's right. I've figured it out.

363
00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:49.000
I could never do it before.

364
00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:52.630
I think I'm getting smarter.
This is a piece of cake.

365
00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:58.220
Help!

366
00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:03.150
Stop it! Help!

367
00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:06.990
What do you mean, "help"? We are helping.

368
00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:09.030
We're helping hands.

369
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.730
You're hurting.

370
00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:13.570
Would you like us to let go?

371
00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.250
Well, then, come on, which way?

372
00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:20.710
Which way?

373
00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.540
Up or down?

374
00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.250
- Oh.
- Come on, come on.

375
00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:28.130
We haven't got all day.

376
00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.960
Well, it's a big decision for her.

377
00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:34.920
- Which way do you want to go”? Hmm?
- Oh.

378
00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.470
Yes, which way?

379
00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:41.980
Well, since I'm pointed that way,
I guess I'll go down.

380
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.480
She chose down!

381
00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:47.400
She chose down?

382
00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:51.320
- Was that wrong?
- Too late now.

383
00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.620
She's in the oubliette.

384
00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.960
Shut up! She should not have gotten
as far as the oubliette

385
00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:10.670
she should have given up by now.

386
00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:13.250
She'll never give up.
“Won't she?

387
00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:15.890
The dwarf's about to lead her back
to the beginning.

388
00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:20.350
She'll soon give up when she realizes
she has to start all over again.

389
00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:23.060
Well, laugh.

390
00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.530
Who's there?

391
00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:37.240
Me.

392
00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:40.040
- Oh, it's you.
- Oh. Yes, well...

393
00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:43.160
I knew you were gonna get into trouble
as soon as I met you.

394
00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:45.240
So I've come to give you a hand.

395
00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:49.210
Oh, you're looking around now, aren't you?

396
00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:52.010
I suppose you noticed
there ain't no doors.

397
00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.510
Only the hole.

398
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:58.510
This is an oubliette.
The labyrinth's full of them.

399
00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.720
- Really? How do you know that?
- Oh, don't sound so smart.

400
00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:05.060
- You don't even know what an oubliette is.
- Do you?

401
00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:09.230
Yes, it's a place you put people
to forget about them.

402
00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:14.160
Now, what you've gotta do
is get out of here.

403
00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:17.080
And it so happens that I know a shortcut

404
00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.120
out of the whole labyrinth from here.

405
00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:21.490
No. I'm not giving up now.

406
00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.620
I've come too far.

407
00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:29.040
No, I'm doing okay.

408
00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:31.290
Of course you are.

409
00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:34.590
But it gets a lot worse from here on in.

410
00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:37.680
Why are you so concerned about me?

411
00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:41.220
Oh... well, I am, that's all.

412
00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:45.900
Nice young girl. Terrible black oubliette.

413
00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:49.180
You like jewelry, don't you?

414
00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:50.280
Why?

415
00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:54.940
If you help me solve the labyrinth,
I'll give you this.

416
00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:58.910
You like it, don't you?

417
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.450
- Uh... so-so.
- Oh_

418
00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.530
Okay.

419
00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:05.740
Tell you what.

420
00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.500
You give me the bracelet,

421
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:09.450
and I'll show you the way out
of the labyrinth.

422
00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:11.130
You were gonna do that anyway.

423
00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.300
Yes, well,

424
00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:15.800
that's what would make it
a particularly nice gesture on your part.

425
00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:18.250
No. I'll tell you what.

426
00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:21.310
If you won't take me to the center,
take me as far as you can,

427
00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:22.680
and then I'll do it on my own.

428
00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:24.760
What is that, anyway?

429
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:27.110
Plastic.

430
00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.350
Ooh

431
00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:32.440
I don't promise nothing, but, uh...

432
00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:36.440
I'll take you as far as I can.
Then you're on your own, right?

433
00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.660
Right. _right.

434
00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:41.990
Ooh. Plastic!

435
00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:47.950
Here we go.

436
00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:53.290
Ta-dum!

437
00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:55.040
Oh! Damn.

438
00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:56.960
Broom closet

439
00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:02.420
well, can't be right all the time, can we”?

440
00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:07.970
Ah, this is it. Come on, then.

441
00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:12.890
Ooh

442
00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:15.690
ah huh.

443
00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:19.110
- This way.
- Don't go on.

444
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.490
Go back while you still can.

445
00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:25.570
This is not the way.

446
00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:29.330
Take heed and go no further.

447
00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:33.580
Beware beware.

448
00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:36.130
Soon it will be too late.

449
00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.970
They're just false alarms.
You get a lot of them in the labyrinth.

450
00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:44.220
Especially when you're on the right track.

451
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:47.180
- Oh, no, you're not.
- Oh, shut up.

452
00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:50.480
- Sorry. Just doing my job.
- You don't have to do it to us.

453
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:53.520
- Beware, for...
- Just forget it.

454
00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:57.270
Aw, please,
I haven't said it for such a long time.

455
00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:00.980
Oh, all right,
but don't expect a big reaction.

456
00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.740
No, no, no, of course not.

457
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:08.240
For the path you will take
will lead to certain destruction.

458
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.990
- Thank you very much.
- Uh-oh.

459
00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:12.090
Oh, no.

460
00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.380
Ah what have we here?

461
00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:22.800
- Oh. Uh, nothing.
- Nothing?

462
00:34:22.890 --> 00:34:25.630
- Nothing? Nothing?
- Uh...

463
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.640
Nothing, tra-la-la”?

464
00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:30.690
Your majesty, what a nice surprise.

465
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:32.930
- Hello, hedgewart.
- Hogwart.

466
00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:34.430
Hoggle.

467
00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:37.360
Hoggle, can it be
that you're helping this girl?

468
00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:40.280
Helping? In what sense”?

469
00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:42.780
In the sense that you're leading her
towards the castle.

470
00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:46.160
No, no, I was taking her back
to the beginning, your majesty.

471
00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:47.750
What?

472
00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:51.240
I told her
I was gonna help her solve the labyrinth,

473
00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:54.370
a little trickery on my part,
but actually...

474
00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:57.670
What is that plastic thing
round your wrist?

475
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:59.430
Oh

476
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:03.670
Oh, this?

477
00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.300
Oh, my goodness,
where did this come from?

478
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:07.390
- Higgle...
- Hoggle.

479
00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.720
Yes. If I thought for one second
that you were betraying me,

480
00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:14.770
I'd be forced to suspend you headfirst
in the bog of eternal stench.

481
00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:19.020
No, your majesty! Not the eternal stench!

482
00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:20.940
Oh, yes, hoggle!

483
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:22.110
And you, Sarah.

484
00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:25.610
How are you enjoying my labyrinth?

485
00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.910
It's a piece of cake.

486
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:35.910
Really”? Then how about
upping the stakes, hmm?

487
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:39.080
That's not fair!

488
00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.260
You say that so often.

489
00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:44.590
I wonder what your basis
for comparison is.

490
00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.800
So the labyrinth's a piece of cake, is it?

491
00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:51.300
Well, let's see how you deal
with this little slice.

492
00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:01.190
No, no, the cleaners!

493
00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.190
- What?
- Run!

494
00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:10.820
You okay?

495
00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:15.070
Come on!

496
00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.080
Faster!

497
00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:23.960
- Hoggle!
- Oh, no!

498
00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:26.170
- Oh!
- Oh, no!

499
00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:28.300
The cleaners! The bog of stench!

500
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:30.430
You sure got his attention.

501
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:56.120
Ah, this is what we need.

502
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:58.870
A ladder. Follow me.

503
00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:01.270
How can I trust you
now that I know you were taking me back

504
00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:02.660
to the beginning of the labyrinth?

505
00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.130
I wasn't.

506
00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:07.180
I told him I was taking you back
to the beginning

507
00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:08.750
just to throw him off the scent.

508
00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:11.710
Hoggle, how can I believe
anything you say?

509
00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:14.470
Well, let me put it this way.

510
00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.680
What choice have you got?

511
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:20.190
You're right.

512
00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:26.400
You see,
you've gotta understand my position.

513
00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:29.980
I'm a coward, and jareth scares me.

514
00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:31.410
What kind of position is that?

515
00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:34.160
No position. That's my point.

516
00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:35.780
And you wouldn't be so brave

517
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:39.290
if you'd ever smelled
the bog of eternal stench.

518
00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:41.410
It's... it's... it's...

519
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:46.670
Is that all it does, is smell?

520
00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:49.170
Oh, believe me, that's enough.

521
00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:50.840
But the worst thing is,

522
00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:54.050
if you so much as put a foot
in the bog of stench,

523
00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:57.350
you'll smell bad
for the rest of your life.

524
00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:00.050
It'll never wash off.

525
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:01.430
Ah

526
00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:08.060
Here we are, then.
You're on your own from now on.

527
00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:12.690
- What?
- That's it. I quit.

528
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:14.740
Wait a minute.

529
00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.400
Hoggle.

530
00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:21.710
I said I didn't promise nothing.
I said I'd take you as far as I could go.

531
00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.210
You little cheat. You nasty little cheat.

532
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:28.210
Now, don't try to embarrass me.
I've got no pride.

533
00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.380
- Oh, yeah?
- Hey! But them's my jewels!

534
00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:34.960
You give them back!
Give them back give those back.

535
00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:36.420
Uh-uh_

536
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.180
Give those back to Mel

537
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:42.850
now, there's the castle.
Which way should we try?

538
00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:46.850
Them's my rightful property.
It's not fair!

539
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:47.980
No, it isn't.

540
00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:51.020
But that's the way it is.

541
00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:57.530
Hmm? Ooh.

542
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:03.960
Excuse me, please,
but can you help me?

543
00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:06.250
Oh! A young qirl!

544
00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:08.920
Wo0, woo, woo.

545
00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:12.210
Huh and who is this? Hmm.

546
00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:15.300
- My friend.
- Well, yes, ah.

547
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:17.800
And what can I do for you?

548
00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:19.880
Please, can you tell...? That is...

549
00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:22.520
I have to get to the castle
at the center of the labyrinth.

550
00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:23.610
Do you know the way?

551
00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:25.730
Ah. Ah. Huh? Huh?

552
00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.860
Well, yes, now.

553
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:32.230
You want to get to the castle, huh?

554
00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.940
How's that for brainpower, huh?

555
00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:35.320
Be quiet!

556
00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:37.150
Ah, nuts.

557
00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:39.910
So, young woman,

558
00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:44.740
the way forward
is sometimes the way back.

559
00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:49.000
Ay, will you listen to this crap?

560
00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:52.880
- Will you please be quiet?
- Ooh, ooh, okay. Sorry. All right.

561
00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:53.970
- Okay?
- Okay!

562
00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:55.300
- All right.
- All right.

563
00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:57.800
- What?
- Sorry.

564
00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:01.270
Finished?

565
00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:03.850
Yes

566
00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:07.730
quite often, young lady,

567
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:11.350
it seems like we're not getting anywhere,

568
00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:12.530
when in fact

569
00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:13.610
we are.

570
00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:15.980
We are.

571
00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.690
I'm certainly not getting anywhere
at the moment.

572
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:20.620
Hal join the club.

573
00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:27.620
L, uh, think that's your lot.

574
00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:30.910
Please leave a contribution
in the little box.

575
00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:35.710
Don't you dare! Them's mine.

576
00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:42.720
Well, I guess I can spare this.

577
00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:47.810
Gracias, senorita.

578
00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:50.940
You didn't have to give him that.

579
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:52.860
He didn't tell you nothing.

580
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:56.030
Well, then, there go a couple of suckers.

581
00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:01.650
Ugh, it's so stimulating being your hat.

582
00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:05.870
Why did you say that,

583
00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.170
about my being your friend?

584
00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:09.620
Because you are.

585
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:11.000
You may not be much of a friend,

586
00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:13.050
but you're the only friend
I've got in this place.

587
00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:14.250
Oh. Huh.

588
00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:16.550
Do you hear something?

589
00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:20.090
- No, it's all right.
- Friend. Huh.

590
00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:21.800
I like that.

591
00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:25.680
I ain't never been
no one's friend before. Huh.

592
00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:28.440
Uh... goodbye!

593
00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:29.980
Wait a minute!

594
00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:32.180
- Keep the stuff.
- Are you my friend or not?

595
00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:34.520
No, I'm not. Hoggle ain't no one's friend.

596
00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:37.190
He looks after himself, like everyone.

597
00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:40.270
Hoggle is hoggle's friend.

598
00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:43.240
Hoggle, you coward!

599
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.710
Well, I'm not afraid.

600
00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:51.210
Things aren't always
what they seem in this place.

601
00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.670
Try on this for size,
you big veti!

602
00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:03.510
We've got you now, fuzzball!

603
00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:06.140
All together, now.

604
00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:16.230
If only I had something to throw.

605
00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:21.730
Fling him over the teriyaki!

606
00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:24.390
- Oh, sock it to him!
- Oh, sock it!

607
00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:26.410
Sock it to him! Sock it to him!

608
00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:34.880
What happened? Who turned out the light?
I can't see!

609
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:39.670
- Why'd you bite me?
- Who bite who?

610
00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:42.090
Who bite me? Who bite me?

611
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:46.800
- I can't see!
- What is going on?

612
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:51.150
Retreat!

613
00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:56.850
Who bit me?

614
00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.680
Oh! My aching Sushi!

615
00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:12.830
Now, stop that.

616
00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:14.410
Huh?

617
00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:17.960
Is that any way to treat someone
who's trying to help you?

618
00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:22.540
Don't you want me to help you down? Hmm?

619
00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:27.890
I udo down.

620
00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:29.140
I udo??

621
00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:31.690
Is that your name?

622
00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.980
- Ludo.
- Ohh_

623
00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:38.270
You seem like such a nice beast

624
00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:42.400
well, I certainly hope
you are what you seem to be.

625
00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:46.780
Just hang on. I'll get you down.

626
00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:50.530
Just a second.

627
00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:53.410
Oh, I'm sorry!

628
00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:54.870
Ohh

629
00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:58.160
ludo, are you hurt?

630
00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:00.000
I udo??

631
00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:07.760
Friend?

632
00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:10.930
That's right, ludo. I'm Sarah.

633
00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:13.930
Sarah

634
00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:17.810
oh. Here, let me help you.

635
00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:19.480
Are you okay?

636
00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:25.230
Sarah

637
00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.480
Sarah friend.

638
00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:31.910
- Now, wait. Just a second.
- Friend. Friend.

639
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.030
I want to ask you something, ludo.

640
00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:35.660
Huh? What?

641
00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:38.330
I have to get to the castle
at the center of the labyrinth.

642
00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:39.420
Do you know the way?

643
00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:43.460
Oh mm... uh

644
00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:45.010
ah

645
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:48.750
- No.
- You don't know either, huh?

646
00:44:48.850 --> 00:44:49.760
No

647
00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:52.170
I wonder if anyone knows how
to get through this labyrinth.

648
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:56.890
Get through the labyrinth.
Get through the labyrinth.

649
00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:01.400
One thing for sure.
She'll never get through the labyrinth.

650
00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:03.270
Pleh.

651
00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:06.690
Hey.

652
00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:08.280
Hmm?

653
00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:11.690
Where did they come from?

654
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:12.950
Hmm.

655
00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:16.200
What do you think, ludo?

656
00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:18.780
Which shall we choose
out of these two ugly characters?

657
00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:21.460
Hmm. Ohh.

658
00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:24.000
Um

659
00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:26.330
It's very rude to stare!

660
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:29.890
Oh! I'm sorry.
I was just wondering which door to choose.

661
00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:32.090
- What?
- It's no good asking him.

662
00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:34.540
- He's as deaf as a post.
- Don't talk with your mouth full.

663
00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:37.180
- I'm not talking with my mouth full!
- Wait a second.

664
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:39.310
- I can't understand you.
- What were you saying?

665
00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:40.600
Ah

666
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.360
Ah oh om om.

667
00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:48.360
- Oh, it is so good to get that thing out.
- What were you saying?

668
00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:51.530
I said, it's no good talking to him.
He's deaf as a post.

669
00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:53.330
Mumble, mumble, mumble.

670
00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:55.450
You're a wonderful
conversational companion.

671
00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:57.780
You can talk! All you do is moan!

672
00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:00.080
No good. Can't hear you.

673
00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:02.000
Oh.

674
00:46:02.090 --> 00:46:03.830
Where do these doors lead?
“What?

675
00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.910
Search me. We're just the knockers.

676
00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:09.840
Oh.

677
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.930
How do I get through? Huh?

678
00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:18.560
Knock and the door will open.

679
00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:19.680
Oh.

680
00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.440
I udo.

681
00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:29.440
I don't want that thing back in my mouth.

682
00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:31.320
- Come on. I wanna knock.
- Mm-mm_

683
00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:34.650
Doesn't want his ring
back in his mouth, eh?

684
00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:37.110
Can't say I blame him.

685
00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:57.930
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

686
00:46:58.020 --> 00:46:59.630
I'm used to it.

687
00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:10.190
Come on, ludo.

688
00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:31.050
You're welcome.

689
00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:38.470
He's a lively little chap.
I think I'll call him jareth.

690
00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:40.470
He's got my eyes.

691
00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:58.740
I udo scared

692
00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:00.870
oh. Give me your hand.

693
00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:02.500
Come on.

694
00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:05.990
Imagine a big thing
like you being scared.

695
00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:07.370
Yeah.

696
00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:11.210
See, ludo?
There's nothing to be afraid of.

697
00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:16.890
I udo.

698
00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:20.180
I udo??

699
00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:24.690
I udo!

700
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:29.970
Ludo, where are you?

701
00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:33.070
Ludo!

702
00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:41.110
Hoggle, help!

703
00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:42.660
I'm coming, Sarah.

704
00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:43.830
Well...

705
00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:45.120
If it isn't you.

706
00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:48.160
And, uh, where are you going?

707
00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:50.370
Uh, uh, well,

708
00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:52.330
the little lady gave me the slip,

709
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:54.960
but, uh, I just hears her now.

710
00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:58.420
So I was about to lead her
back to the beginning,

711
00:48:58.510 --> 00:49:01.220
like you told me.

712
00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:02.920
- I see.
- Ludo!

713
00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:05.730
For one moment I thought
you were running to help her.

714
00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:09.430
But, uh, no, not after my warnings.

715
00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:11.020
That would be stupid.

716
00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:12.850
Oh, you bet it would.

717
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:16.280
Me, help her, after your warnings?

718
00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:22.990
- Oh, dear. Poor hoghead.
- Hoggle.

719
00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:27.420
I've just noticed
your lovely jewels are missing.

720
00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:28.500
Uh

721
00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:30.910
Oh, yes, so they are.

722
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:34.000
- My lovely jewels. Let me think. Uh, uh...
- Ludo!

723
00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:37.170
I better find them,
but first I'm off to take the little lady

724
00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:40.130
back to the beginning of the labyrinth,
just like we planned.

725
00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:41.380
Wait

726
00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:44.010
I've got a much better plan, hoggle.

727
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:47.720
Give her this.

728
00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:51.560
Wha... what is it?

729
00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:53.850
It's a present.

730
00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:56.190
It ain't gonna hurt the little lady,
is it?

731
00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:57.990
Oh, now, why the concern?

732
00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:01.030
Uh, I won't do nothing to harm her.

733
00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:02.980
Oh, come, come, come, hogbrain.

734
00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:05.490
I'm surprised at you,
losing your head over a qirl.

735
00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:07.450
I ain't lost my head.

736
00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:12.000
You don't think a young girl
could ever like a repulsive little scab

737
00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:13.620
like you, do you?

738
00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:15.750
Well, she said we was... “What?

739
00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:17.300
Bosom companions?

740
00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:19.300
Friends?

741
00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:21.760
Don't matter.

742
00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:23.510
You'll give her that, hoggle,

743
00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:26.470
or I'll tip you straight
into the bog of eternal stench

744
00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:28.350
before you can blink.

745
00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:30.020
Yes. Right.

746
00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:33.560
And, hoggle,

747
00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:37.440
if she ever kisses you,
I'll turn you into a prince.

748
00:50:37.530 --> 00:50:39.520
You... you will?

749
00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:41.860
Prince of the land of stench.

750
00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:49.410
I udo??

751
00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.200
I udo??

752
00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:58.910
What's going on?

753
00:51:03.350 --> 00:51:05.510
- What do you want?
- What, us?

754
00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:09.140
We just have to have a good time.

755
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:10.340
That's right!

756
00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:12.900
Yeah!

757
00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:17.610
- " don't got no problems "
- " no problems "

758
00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:20.530

- "  I just throw in my hand "
- " throw in his hand "

762
00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:33.410
- " with the chilliest bunch in the land "
- " in the land "

763
00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:34.830

" bad hep with the fire gang "

769
00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:49.680

771
00:51:52.310 --> 00:51:54.550

00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:57.770
" act tall with the fire gang "

774
00:51:57.860 --> 00:51:58.980
walk tall.

775

come on! Come on!

807
00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:27.060
Hey, hey! Her head don't come off.

808
00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:29.240
Of course it doesn't!

809
00:53:29.330 --> 00:53:30.820
She's right. It's stuck on.

810
00:53:30.910 --> 00:53:33.620
Hey, lady.
Where you going with a head like that?

811
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:37.420
Hey, man, I know what we can do.
Take off her head!

812
00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:40.200
Yeah, let's take her apart.

813
00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:42.080
Hey, lady, that's his head.

814
00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:44.500
Hey, that's my head!
“That's a friend of mine.

815
00:53:44.590 --> 00:53:47.170
- What are you doing?
- Hey, lady...

816
00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:49.920
- Hey! Whoa!
- Where'd it go?

817
00:53:51.010 --> 00:53:52.420
Who threw that head?

818
00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:54.970
Hey, lady.

819
00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:57.350
It's against the rules
to throw other people's heads.

820
00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:00.480
Yo. You're only allowed
to throw your own head.

821
00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:02.150
- Yeah, that's right.
- Come on.

822
00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:04.360
Where's the referee?

823
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:07.860
Now we got to take your head off.

824
00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:11.280
- Somebody stop her.
- Come back, little lady.

825
00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:12.370
Play the game.

826
00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:14.820
Yeah, we're going to throw your head.

827
00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:17.580
You can't quit. The game's not over.

828
00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:20.310
- Hey, lady!
- I eave me alone!

829
00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:21.540
We get a free throw.

830
00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:24.210
Hey, lady,
you want to take your head off, don't you?

831
00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:25.660
Sure, she does.

832
00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:27.370
- Hoggle!
- Grab it!

833
00:54:28.090 --> 00:54:30.840
- Don't you want to look like us?
- I eave me alone!

834
00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:35.010
Take off your head!
“It won't hurt! Get a saw!

835
00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:37.390
If you play, we'll take off your arms!

836
00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:41.560
And ear. Take off your ear.
You don't need two ears.

837
00:54:41.650 --> 00:54:43.310
- Game"s almost over.
- Down's up.

838
00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:44.810
Shoo! Go away.

839
00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:48.440
Hoggle, you've come to help me.

840
00:54:50.570 --> 00:54:53.490
- Don't kiss me! Don't kiss me!
- Mwah. Mwah...

841
00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:56.990
No, no, no!

842
00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:05.080
Hoggle, hold on!

843
00:55:08.930 --> 00:55:10.710
Oh, my god.

844
00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:17.800
Ugh! What is it?

845
00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:21.470
The bog of eternal stench.

846
00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:28.610
I've never smelled anything like it.
It's like. Like.

847
00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:36.530
It doesn't matter what it's like.
It's a bog of eternal stench.

848
00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:37.740
Help!

849
00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:41.330
Hold on.

850
00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:48.040
Now, what did you have to go
and do a thing like that for?

851
00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:50.620
- Do what?
- Bleh!

852
00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:55.760
You mean rescue you? “What? No.

853
00:55:55.850 --> 00:55:57.550
You kissed me.

854
00:56:03.730 --> 00:56:06.020
Oh, my gosh.

855
00:56:06.650 --> 00:56:08.640
Don't pretend to be so hard.

856
00:56:09.650 --> 00:56:13.360
I know you came back to help me,
and I know that you're my friend.

857
00:56:13.450 --> 00:56:15.230
Did not. Am not.

858
00:56:15.330 --> 00:56:18.320
I just come to get me property back.

859
00:56:18.830 --> 00:56:19.910

Where's hoggle?

865
00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:42.770
Get off of me!

866
00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:45.220
Oh, here.

867
00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:48.310
Hoggle.

00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:51.940
Oh, no, it's okay. This is ludo.
He's a friend too.

Smell!

871
00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:56.610
Ugh. You're right.

872
00:57:00.370 --> 00:57:02.530
Oh, my god.

873
00:57:05.830 --> 00:57:07.950
There's a bridge. Come on.

874
00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:12.330
Ow.

875
00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:14.630
Watch it.

876
00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:18.050
You step in this stuff,
and you'll stink forever.

877
00:57:20.810 --> 00:57:22.970
Stop!

878
00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:25.970
- Stop, I say.
- Please, we have to get across.

879
00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:28.350
Without my permission, no one may cross.

880
00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:30.730
Please, I only have a little time left.

881
00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:33.690
We've gotta get out of this stench.

882
00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:35.900
Smell bad

883
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:38.780
- stench? Of what speaketh thou?
- This smell.

884
00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:43.360
- I smell nothing.
- Oh, you're joking.

885
00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:46.070
But I live by my sense of smell.

886
00:57:48.790 --> 00:57:51.080
The air is sweet and fragrant,

887
00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:52.750
and none may pass
without my permission!

888
00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:55.800
Smell bad

889
00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:58.250
get out of my way.

890
00:57:58.350 --> 00:58:02.130
I warn thee, I'm sworn to do my duty.

891
00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:05.220
- Come on. Let us get across.
- Hold!

892
00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:09.010
Hi-yah!

893
00:58:09.110 --> 00:58:12.190
Listen,
I don't want to have to hurt you.

894
00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:13.890
Hoggle, what are you doing?

895
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:16.400
Let go of my staff, sir!

896
00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:20.940
Oh, wap!

897
00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:23.330
Hmm? Huh?

898
00:58:23.410 --> 00:58:26.900
All right, then.
I can conquer this mountain.

899
00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:32.160
\whoal

900
00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:35.160
ow!

901
00:58:38.590 --> 00:58:41.180
Wah!

902
00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:51.850
Thou must do better than that.

903
00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:54.150
Give up? Huh? Huh? Huh?

904
00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:09.700
Enough!

905
00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:15.170
Before this day,
never have I met my match in battle.

906
00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:19.090
Yet this noble knight has fought me
to a standstill.

907
00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:22.710
Are you all right, ludo? Smell!

908
00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:27.510
Sir ludo, if that is thy name,
now I, sir didymus, yield to thee.

909
00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:29.970
Come, let us be brothers henceforth

910
00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:31.970
and fight for the right as one.

911
00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:38.150
- Ah. Thank you very much.
- Ludo get brother.

912
00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:39.240
Steady.

913
00:59:40.570 --> 00:59:42.980
- Well met, sir ludo.
- Good come on.

914
00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:46.660
Wait a minute.
You forget my sacred vow, my lady.

915
00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:50.410
- I cannot let you pass.
- But you just said ludo is your brother.

916
00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:54.120
I have taken an oath,
and I must defend it to the death

917
00:59:54.210 --> 00:59:56.700
- smell!
- Okay.

918
00:59:56.800 --> 01:00:00.290
Let's handle this thing logically.
What exactly have you sworn?

919
01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:04.720
I have sworn with my lifeblood
no one shall pass this way

920
01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:06.800
without my permission.

921
01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:12.310
Well... may we have your permission?

922
01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:16.850
Well, I, uh... um... uh...

923
01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.400
Hmm.

924
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:25.900
- Yes?
- Thank you, noble sir.

925
01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:27.360
My lady.

926
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.960
- Uh-oh.
- Have no fear, sweet lady.

927
01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:37.130
This bridge has lasted
for a thousand years.

928
01:00:37.210 --> 01:00:38.950
Oh! No!

929
01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:49.680
- It seemed solid enough.
- Hoggle!

930
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:55.930
Fear not, fair maiden. I will save thee.

931
01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:57.060
Somehow.

932
01:00:59.190 --> 01:01:03.230
Sir ludo, canst thou sit by and how
when yon maiden needs our help?

933
01:01:33.350 --> 01:01:35.930
- That's incredible, ludo.
- My brother!

934
01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:38.310
Canst thou summon up the very rocks?

935
01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:42.480
Sure. Rocks friends.

936
01:01:44.650 --> 01:01:45.730
Hoggle!

937
01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:49.650
- Here.
- Thanks, hoggle.

938
01:01:54.370 --> 01:01:55.660
Be careful, ludo.

939
01:02:03.090 --> 01:02:04.950
Sir ludo, wait for me.

940
01:02:05.050 --> 01:02:06.760
Oh. Ambrosius!

941
01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:09.930
It's all right, ambrosius.
You can come out now.

942
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:13.470
Come on. Thattaboy.

943
01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:17.350
My loyal steed. Steady.

944
01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:19.430
A-hup. Ah.

945
01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:22.480
Forward. Steady, steady, boy.

946
01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:26.150
Come on, ambrosius.
Just close your eyes and go.

947
01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:31.490
Let's get out of here.

948
01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:37.200
Excuse us. Thank you.

949
01:02:44.170 --> 01:02:47.080
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

950
01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:50.460
Oh, please, I can't give it to her.

951
01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:55.430
Well, come on, then.

952
01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.850
We should reach the castle
well before day.

953
01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:08.190
Look, Sarah,
is this what you're trying to find?

954
01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:13.990
So much trouble over such a little thing,
but not for long.

955
01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:18.200
She'll soon forget all about you,
my fine fellow.

956
01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:21.620
Just as soon as hoggle
gives her my present,

957
01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:25.370
then she'll forget everything.

958
01:03:27.130 --> 01:03:29.670
Is that my stomach or yours, ambrosius?

959
01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:32.930
Hungry.

960
01:03:33.850 --> 01:03:37.560
Yeah. Well, we can't stop now.

961
01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:41.300
Maybe we can find some berries
or something.

962
01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.260
Uh, Sarah.

963
01:03:44.110 --> 01:03:47.320
Yeah? Uh. Here.

964
01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.860
Hoggle.

965
01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:51.900
Oh, thank you.

966
01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:54.480
You're a lifesaver.

967
01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:06.990
This tastes strange.

968
01:04:14.050 --> 01:04:15.170
Hoggle, what have you done?

969
01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:17.680
Oh, damn you, jareth.

970
01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:20.880
And damn me too.

971
01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:34.320
Everything's dancing.

972
01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:42.890
Yea, verily.
Whoa, ambrosius, whoa.

973
01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:45.890
The castle doth lie yonder, my lady.

974
01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:48.360
My lady?

975
01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:52.110
My lady? My lady?

976
01:06:39.410 --> 01:06:42.490

Oh. She'll never forgive me.

What have I done?

1018
01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:53.260
I've lost my only friend.

1019
01:09:54.190 --> 01:09:56.270
That's what I've done.

1020
01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:08.520
What was I doing?

1021
01:10:13.370 --> 01:10:14.370
Huh?

1022
01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:17.780
Ew. Ugh!

1023
01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:22.420
Ow. Get off my back!

1024
01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:29.630
Why don't you look where you're going,
young woman, hmm?

1025
01:10:31.010 --> 01:10:33.720
- I was looking.
- Huh? Huh? Hmm?

1026
01:10:33.810 --> 01:10:36.300
And where were you going, hmm?

1027
01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:39.050
I don't remember.

1028
01:10:39.150 --> 01:10:42.510
You can't look where you're going
if you don't know where you're going.

1029
01:10:42.610 --> 01:10:44.270
I was searching for something.

1030
01:10:45.150 --> 01:10:46.730
Well, look here.

1031
01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:49.530
Ooh

1032
01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:53.530

1033
01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:56.250
Thank you.

1034
01:10:56.290 --> 01:11:00.410
That's what you were looking for.
Wasn't it, my dear?

1035
01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:03.290
Yes. I forgot.

1036
01:11:04.090 --> 01:11:09.330
Now, why don't you come in here

1037
01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:14.760
and see if there's anything else
you'd like, hmm?

1038
01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:29.990
Oh

1039
01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:47.210
It was just a dream.

1040
01:11:50.090 --> 01:11:52.170
I dreamed it all, Lancelot.

1041
01:11:54.970 --> 01:11:56.630
But it was so real

1042
01:12:00.230 --> 01:12:02.340
let's go see if daddy's back, okay?

1043
01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:10.570
Better to stay in here, dear. Yes.

1044
01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:14.940
There's nothing you want out there.
No. Oh, no.

1045
01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:18.070
Ooh, what have we got here?

1046
01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:19.400
I ancelot.

1047
01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:23.120
Oh, your little bunny rabbit.
You like your little bunny rabbit.

1048
01:12:23.210 --> 01:12:25.170
Don't you? Yes, yes, yes. There you go.

1049
01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:28.340
Ooh, and there's Betsy boo.
You remember Betsy boo, don't you?

1050
01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:29.910
Yes, yes, yes.

1051
01:12:30.010 --> 01:12:33.590
Now, then, what else have we got?
What's this? Ooh, let's have a look.

1052
01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:37.470
Ooh, it's a pencil box.
Got lots of pencils in it too. And, oh.

1053
01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:38.640
Here's your panda slippers.

1054
01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:40.810
You know how much
you like your panda slippers.

1055
01:12:40.890 --> 01:12:43.130
You never wanted them thrown away.
There they are.

1056
01:12:43.230 --> 01:12:44.310
That's right. That's right.

1057
01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:48.110
Okay. Now, then, what else?
Oh, it's little horsy.

1058
01:12:48.190 --> 01:12:50.600
You love little horsy, don't you, dear?

1059
01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:54.780
And look at this.
You got a printing game, you have.

1060
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:58.480
Oh, here's a treasure.
You'll want that. Won't you, my dear?

1061
01:12:58.580 --> 01:13:01.820
Yes, go on. Put it on. Make yourself up.

1062
01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:06.000
And here's dear old flopsy.
You'll want her, right? There you go.

1063
01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:09.870
Oh, yes. Ah. Oh, yes.

1064
01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:13.880
Charlie bear. Right.
There's Charlie bear for you. Hmm? Huh?

1065
01:13:13.970 --> 01:13:15.880
There was something I was looking for.

1066
01:13:15.970 --> 01:13:19.840
Ah, don't talk nonsense. It's all here.

1067
01:13:19.930 --> 01:13:23.600
Everything in the world
you've ever cared about is all right here.

1068
01:13:23.690 --> 01:13:25.770
Look, there's your little toy candy shop.

1069
01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:27.470
"Through dangers untold

1070
01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:30.310
and hardships unnumbered,

1071
01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:34.400
I fought my way here to the castle

1072
01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:36.850
beyond the goblin city

1073
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:40.910
to take back the child
that you have stolen."

1074
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.160
Huh? Huh? What's the matter, my dear?
Don't you like your toys?

1075
01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.040
It's all junk.

1076
01:13:48.130 --> 01:13:49.620
Huh? Eh?

1077
01:13:49.710 --> 01:13:51.790
Well, what about this?

1078
01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:56.750
This is not junk, eh? Ooh.

1079
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:58.710
Yes, it is!

1080
01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:02.180
I have to save Toby!

1081
01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:08.980
My lady!

1082
01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:13.230
- Sarah. Sarah.
- Are you all right?

1083
01:14:14.570 --> 01:14:16.810
- My lady.
- Sarah.

1084
01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:22.610
Fair maiden.
Thank goodness thou art safe at last.

1085
01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:24.790
Where are we? Sarah back.

1086
01:14:24.870 --> 01:14:27.330
My lady, look, we're almost there.

1087
01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:29.370
Those are the gates to the goblin city.

1088
01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:32.330
Ludo, sir didymus.

1089
01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:35.910
Let's go quickly.
We don't have much time.

1090
01:14:36.010 --> 01:14:39.130
- Yeah.
- Right. Ambrosius, forward.

1091
01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:42.050
No, no.

1092
01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:46.770
Open up! Open the door!

1093
01:14:46.850 --> 01:14:49.590
Shh. Sir didymus, we must go quietly.

1094
01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:53.680
Open up. Open up right now!

1095
01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:56.640
Sir didymus, you'll wake the guard. Quiet.

1096
01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:58.900
Well, let them all wake up!

1097
01:14:59.570 --> 01:15:02.940
- Shh.
- I shall fight you all to the death!

1098
01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:09.080
Shh. Please, sir didymus,
for my sake, hush.

1099
01:15:09.170 --> 01:15:11.280
But of course. For thee, anything.

1100
01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:13.580
But I'm not a coward? No.

1101
01:15:13.670 --> 01:15:15.830
- And my sense of smell is keen?
- Oh, yes.

1102
01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:19.540
Then I shall fight anyone anywhere,
anyplace, anytime!

1103
01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:22.670
Yes, yes, we know, we know. Now, hush.

1104
01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:26.140
Come quietly.

1105
01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:30.220
Ambrosius, be quiet, now. Hup.

1106
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:33.220
I don't see why we have to be so quiet.

1107
01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:35.480
It's only a goblin city.

1108
01:15:35.570 --> 01:15:37.230
I smell trouble.

1109
01:15:43.370 --> 01:15:44.480
Come on, ludo.

1110
01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:47.450
Oh, no.

1111
01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:52.950
What is that?

1112
01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:59.460
Who goes?

1113
01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:06.930
Who goes?

1114
01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:14.060
Who goes?

1115
01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:23.850
Watch out!

1116
01:16:25.490 --> 01:16:27.230
Whoa!

1117
01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:31.660
Ambrosius!

1118
01:16:37.710 --> 01:16:39.800
Ambrosius, will you come here?

1119
01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:44.750
Ambrosius, come here right now!

1120
01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:48.210
Will you please come?
Oh, but you're embarrassing me.

1121
01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:53.310
Careful, ludo.

1122
01:16:54.650 --> 01:16:56.560
Hoggle! Huh?

1123
01:16:57.150 --> 01:16:58.150
Whoa!

1124
01:17:03.070 --> 01:17:05.060
Look out!

1125
01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:09.400
Get out of there.

1126
01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:12.660
What are you doing?

1127
01:17:14.170 --> 01:17:16.030
Bombs away!

1128
01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:21.630
That wasn't very nice.

1129
01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:24.590
My turn now.

1130
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:28.550
How do you drive this thing?

1131
01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:34.430
Drop the ax!

1132
01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:36.350
I'm trying.

1133
01:17:37.570 --> 01:17:39.100
Come here at once.

1134
01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:43.860
Ohh. Where's reverse?

1135
01:17:50.410 --> 01:17:53.620
Get out of there, hoggle!

1136
01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:56.200
Abandon ship!

1137
01:17:58.790 --> 01:18:01.290
Hoggle!

1138
01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:06.210
Oh, hoggle, are you all right?

1139
01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:11.890
I'm not asking to be forgiven.
I ain't ashamed of nothing I did.

1140
01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:15.380
Jareth made me give you that peach.

1141
01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:19.100
I don't care what you think of me.
I told you I was a coward.

1142
01:18:19.190 --> 01:18:21.230
And I ain't interested in being friends.

1143
01:18:22.690 --> 01:18:24.060
I forgive you, hoggle.

1144
01:18:25.650 --> 01:18:27.860
You... you do?

1145
01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:32.900
And I commend you.
Rarely have I seen such courage.

1146
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.490
You are a Valiant man, sir hoggle.

1147
01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:37.200
Huh I am?

1148
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.410
Hoggle and ludo friends.

1149
01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.460
We are?

1150
01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:46.760
Here are your things, hoggle.

1151
01:18:48.260 --> 01:18:49.380
Thanks for your help.

1152
01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:53.010
Well, what are we waiting for? Huh?

1153
01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:55.590
Let's get that rat
who calls himself jareth

1154
01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:57.300
- right. Come on.
- Yeah.

1155
01:18:57.390 --> 01:19:00.180
Ambrosius, it's safe now.
Nothing to be afraid of.

1156
01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:28.170
Your highness!

1157
01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:29.500
Your highness!

1158
01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:33.290
Your highness, the girl...
“What?

1159
01:19:33.390 --> 01:19:35.760
The girl who ate the peach
and forgot everything...

1160
01:19:35.850 --> 01:19:36.680
What of her?

1161
01:19:36.770 --> 01:19:39.880
She's here with the monster, sir didymus
and the dwarf who worked for you.

1162
01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:41.410
- What?
- They got through the gates,

1163
01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:43.000
and they're on their way to the castle!

1164
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:47.680
Stop her! Call out the guards.
Take the baby and hide it.

1165
01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:50.140
- Guards!
- She must be stopped.

1166
01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:51.270
Do something!

1167
01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:55.360
Come on, move. Move!

1168
01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:08.120
- I think we're gonna make fit.
- Oh, piece of cake.

1169
01:20:14.850 --> 01:20:17.010
Company, halt.

1170
01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:27.310
Lances ready!

1171
01:20:30.530 --> 01:20:32.520
Cannon, fire!

1172
01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:39.530
- Ambrosius! Turn around!
- Run!

1173
01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:41.330
Uh, ambrosius, turn about!

1174
01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:44.120
- Quick, this way.
- All right. Charge!

1175
01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:47.750
No, not that way!

1176
01:20:49.550 --> 01:20:52.260
You're going the wrong way!

1177
01:20:53.090 --> 01:20:54.960
The battle's behind us!

1178
01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:02.180
Ambrosius, can we please talk about this?

1179
01:21:02.810 --> 01:21:03.970
Sit!

1180
01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:11.270
Be careful. Okay.

1181
01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:12.360
Through here.

1182
01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:18.690
Ambrosius, I'm serious.

1183
01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:21.780
Okay, come on, guys.

1184
01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:26.460
Ambrosius, if you don't turn around
this second,

1185
01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:28.500
I will never feed you again.

1186
01:21:31.630 --> 01:21:32.840
That's better.

1187
01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:38.300
Don't worry, ambrosius.
I think we've got them surrounded.

1188
01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:43.340
Didymus! Where's didymus?

1189
01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:45.850
Fire!

1190
01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:49.850
I hit something, yes”? No?

1191
01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:52.640
We've gotta find didymus.

1192
01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:56.560
Down this way.

1193
01:22:14.970 --> 01:22:17.380
Charge!

1194
01:22:23.850 --> 01:22:27.140
Tallyho!

1195
01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:33.150
Ambrosius, you coward!

1196
01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:39.360
Ambrosius!

1197
01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.360
Quick, in here.

1198
01:22:45.710 --> 01:22:47.490
How's ludo gonna get in”?

1199
01:23:09.230 --> 01:23:11.350
You in there, you're surrounded!

1200
01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:13.930
Huh? Surrounded?

1201
01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:18.860
Get out! Ludo, call the rocks!

1202
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:19.950
Huh?

1203
01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:33.500
- Take that!
- Hungry? Great.

1204
01:23:35.550 --> 01:23:36.960
I udo!

1205
01:23:38.050 --> 01:23:40.340
Ambrosius, unlock this door.

1206
01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:49.170
So had enough, have you?

1207
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:53.890
All right, then, throw down your weapons,
and I'll see that you're well treated.

1208
01:23:55.230 --> 01:23:56.970
Hi-yah!

1209
01:23:57.070 --> 01:23:58.070
I udo!

1210
01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:23.420
Next time, surrender.

1211
01:24:33.230 --> 01:24:34.640
Good grief!

1212
01:24:40.570 --> 01:24:41.570
Steady, men.

1213
01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:45.990
Steady, men. Hold your ground.

1214
01:24:51.210 --> 01:24:54.200
Okay, I take it back. Run for your lives!

1215
01:24:54.290 --> 01:24:57.000
I've had enough. I'm going to bed.

1216
01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:01.250
Get out of my house!

1217
01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:25.520
Whoa, Nellie! Duck!

1218
01:25:27.950 --> 01:25:29.740
Missed!

1219
01:25:30.450 --> 01:25:31.790
Okay, come on.

1220
01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:37.160
Fire!

1221
01:25:38.670 --> 01:25:40.830
Hey, I just fired you.

1222
01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:42.750
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

1223
01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:46.800
This way.

1224
01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:52.600
Now we have you!

1225
01:25:54.810 --> 01:25:56.220
And now you don't.

1226
01:26:06.410 --> 01:26:08.150
Huh?

1227
01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:15.830
Hey, no problem.

1228
01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:22.080
- Sir didymus!
- Coming!

1229
01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:40.220
- Whoa, boy. Whoa, fella.
- This way.

1230
01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:41.680
Steady, boy.

1231
01:26:44.490 --> 01:26:47.400
Ah, yes. Up you go. Up, up.

1232
01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:52.320
Come on. Good boy. Come on.

1233
01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:54.860
No.

1234
01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:56.790
Good boy. Come on.

1235
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:58.160
Whoa.

1236
01:26:58.250 --> 01:27:00.650
- That's the only way he could've gone.
- Well, then, come on.

1237
01:27:00.670 --> 01:27:02.750
No, no. I have to face him alone.

1238
01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:04.920
But why? Yes

1239
01:27:05.010 --> 01:27:07.090
because that's the way it's done.

1240
01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:09.710
Well, if that is the way it is done,

1241
01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:12.040
then that is the way you must do it.

1242
01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:14.930
But should you need us...

1243
01:27:15.770 --> 01:27:18.180
Yes, should you need us...

1244
01:27:19.350 --> 01:27:20.430
I'll call

1245
01:27:21.730 --> 01:27:23.640

" how you turn my world
you precious thing "

1247
01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:59.220

1248
01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:06.720
" everything I've done
I've done for you "

1249
01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:11.820
I I move the stars for no one "

1250
01:28:16.540 --> 01:28:20.320
" you've run so long
you've run so far "

1251
01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:29.750
" your eyes can be so cruel "

1252
01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:36.300
dn just as I can be so cruel I

1253
01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:44.770
" oh, I do believe in you I

1254
01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:47.100
Toby!

1255
01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:51.140
" yes, ido/d

1256
01:28:53.530 --> 01:28:56.570
" live without your sunlight "

1257
01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:02.280
" love without your heartbeat "

1258
01:29:04.750 --> 01:29:11.540
" I, I can't live within you "

1259
01:29:53.130 --> 01:29:54.460
Toby!

1260
01:29:58.890 --> 01:29:59.890
Toby.

1261
01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:19.530
Toby.

1262
01:30:56.490 --> 01:30:57.490
Give me the child.

1263
01:30:58.450 --> 01:30:59.900
Sarah, beware.

1264
01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:05.110
I have been generous up until now,
but I can be cruel.

1265
01:31:05.210 --> 01:31:06.790
Senerous?

1266
01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:11.370
- What have you done that's generous?
- Everything!

1267
01:31:12.130 --> 01:31:14.710
Everything that you wanted, I have done.

1268
01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:18.630
You asked that the child be taken.
I took him.

1269
01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:22.460
You cowered before me. I was frightening.

1270
01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:24.890
I have reordered time,

1271
01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:27.760
I have turned the world upside down,

1272
01:31:27.850 --> 01:31:30.220
and I have done it all for you.

1273
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:35.650
I am exhausted from living up
to your expectations of me.

1274
01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:37.320
Isn't that generous?

1275
01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:44.480
Through dangers untold
and hardships unnumbered,

1276
01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:49.490
I have fought my way here
to the castle beyond the goblin city.

1277
01:31:52.210 --> 01:31:54.080
For my will is as strong as yours...

1278
01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:58.370
- And my...
- Stop. Wait.

1279
01:31:58.970 --> 01:32:00.080
Look, Sarah.

1280
01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:02.790
Look what I'm offering you.

1281
01:32:03.930 --> 01:32:05.390
Your dreams.

1282
01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:09.640
And my kingdom as great.

1283
01:32:10.270 --> 01:32:12.560
I ask for so little.

1284
01:32:13.310 --> 01:32:15.270
Just let me rule you,

1285
01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:19.360
and you can have everything
that you want.

1286
01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:24.110
Kingdom as great.

1287
01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:26.870
Damn.

1288
01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:29.110
I can never remember that line.

1289
01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:33.040
Just fear me, love me, do as I say,

1290
01:32:33.130 --> 01:32:35.540
and I will be your slave.

1291
01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:40.790
My kingdom as great.
My kingdom as great.

1292
01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:49.840
You have no power over me.

1293
01:32:51.770 --> 01:32:54.100
You have no power over me.

1294
01:33:38.530 --> 01:33:39.560
Toby.

1295
01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:44.440
Toby! Toby.

1296
01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:46.120
Toby?

1297
01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:16.850
Here you are.

1298
01:34:18.270 --> 01:34:21.020
I'd like Lancelot to belong to you now.

1299
01:34:44.670 --> 01:34:45.710
We're home!

1300
01:34:52.810 --> 01:34:54.920
Sarah, are you home?

1301
01:34:55.890 --> 01:34:58.010
Yeah. Yes, I'm home.

1302
01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:03.400
Goodbye, Sarah.

1303
01:35:12.990 --> 01:35:14.450
And remember, fair maiden,

1304
01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:16.400
should you need us...

1305
01:35:17.670 --> 01:35:19.910
Yes, should you need us,

1306
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.960
for any reason at all...

1307
01:35:23.050 --> 01:35:24.660
I need you, hoggle.

1308
01:35:25.470 --> 01:35:26.580
You do?

1309
01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:29.840
I don't know why, but...

1310
01:35:30.930 --> 01:35:32.970
Every now and again in my life,

1311
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:36.850
for no reason at all, I need you.

1312
01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:38.270
All of you.

1313
01:35:38.350 --> 01:35:40.590
Uh, you do?

1314
01:35:40.690 --> 01:35:44.060
Well, why didn't you say so?

1315
01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:51.860
Didy!

1316
01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:57.650
- Ludo!
- Sarah.

1317
01:35:57.750 --> 01:36:01.240
Ambrosius, good boy, good boy.

1318
01:36:03.380 --> 01:36:04.870
Come here.

1319
01:36:08.260 --> 01:36:10.870
I say, does anyone here
want to play a game of scrabble?

1320
01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:34.970
- You remind me of the babe.
- What babe?

1321
01:36:34.990 --> 01:36:36.800
- The babe with the power.
- What power?

1322
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:38.430
- The power of voodoo.
- Who do?

1323
01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:39.640
- You do.
- Do what?

1324
01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:41.250
Remind me of the babe.

1325
01:36:45.550 --> 01:36:49.880
